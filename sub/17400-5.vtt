WEBVTT

00:11.277 --> 00:13.816
Tonight, I hold up a jar.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.792
James points at a hill.

00:18.272 --> 00:19.952
Richard eats a sandwich.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:28.032 --> 00:34.831
Hello! Hello and welcome! Thank you
so much, everybody! Thank you.

00:34.832 --> 00:38.391
We start tonight with
a big and important issue.

00:38.392 --> 00:40.231
You see, back in 1975,

00:40.232 --> 00:45.631
just 15% of people aged over 70
had a driving license.

00:45.632 --> 00:49.071
Today, it's more than 60%,
and that means

00:49.072 --> 00:54.791
the roads are full of people whose
eyes are broken and whose feet hurt.

00:54.792 --> 00:58.871
And car-makers are just not
recognising this fact.

00:58.872 --> 01:02.230
Most modern cars are made
for techno-savvy teenagers.

01:02.231 --> 01:04.730
Yeah, my mother, she just says
all she wants from a car

01:04.769 --> 01:06.169
is Classic FM and a heater

01:06.170 --> 01:08.969
and everything else is
a waste of money and annoying

01:08.970 --> 01:10.649
and possibly even dangerous.

01:10.650 --> 01:14.291
Which is why Jeremy and I decided it
was time we went out and bought

01:14.292 --> 01:19.571
a car to modify specially for today's
enormous army of pensioner drivers.

01:22.011 --> 01:24.971
This meant heading to
the Top Gear Technology Centre -

01:24.972 --> 01:28.530
the birthplace of all our
great projects.

01:28.531 --> 01:31.851
And, while Richard went off to buy
a car which we could modify,

01:31.852 --> 01:34.851
I examined the scale of the problem.

01:37.051 --> 01:40.691
This Volvo has very few buttons,
and that's a good thing, but each

01:40.692 --> 01:45.810
one seems to do 28 different things
depending on how you push it.

01:45.811 --> 01:50.370
What does My Car mean? BLIS?
DSTC?

01:50.371 --> 01:53.611
Collision Warning? Why would you
want to turn that off?!

01:53.612 --> 01:56.250
And look at these -
if you're 85,

01:56.251 --> 01:58.851
these are just
out-of-focus hieroglyphics!

02:00.211 --> 02:02.731
Things were just as bad
in this Ford Focus.

02:05.771 --> 02:08.690
What does Block 5A mean?

02:08.691 --> 02:10.490
There's literally nothing,

02:10.491 --> 02:14.290
nothing on here which is
old-people friendly.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.251
"Press source for USB BT line in."

02:18.771 --> 02:21.490
I'm sure all this
makes perfect sense

02:21.491 --> 02:23.850
to the foetus that designed it,

02:23.851 --> 02:28.531
but to anyone over 65 it is
just incomprehensible gibberish.

02:29.731 --> 02:33.369
'Before I had a chance to get to
grips with the Citroen...'

02:33.370 --> 02:37.331
Oh, for BLEEP sake! '..Richard was
back with the car he'd bought -

02:37.332 --> 02:41.490
'a Fiat Multipla, famous for having
three seats in the front

02:41.491 --> 02:43.331
'and three in the back.

02:44.851 --> 02:48.651
'To decide what to do with it,
we set up a mood room.'

03:03.371 --> 03:06.849
All top designers use
rooms like this to put them into

03:06.850 --> 03:10.691
the actual mind of the customers
they're trying to attract.

03:10.692 --> 03:15.450
So, for example, we have an early
vacuum cleaner, a one-bar heater,

03:15.451 --> 03:18.249
a TV listings magazine,
many of which are available,

03:18.250 --> 03:21.369
with the programmes
we want to watch highlighted.

03:21.370 --> 03:24.249
It really is just like being
in James May's front room.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.011
Well, where do you think
we got everything from?

03:29.451 --> 03:32.890
What I'm seeing with
every single thing in here

03:32.891 --> 03:37.010
is simplicity and comfort.

03:37.011 --> 03:42.690
Comfort on the chair, simplicity
of the mop, the kettle, the TV.

03:42.691 --> 03:44.650
Everything is simple.

03:44.651 --> 03:47.370
It's simple... straightforward
and yet,

03:47.371 --> 03:50.491
in the case of this small sofa,
also strangely itchy.

03:52.371 --> 03:58.330
After several intense hours
in the mood room, we at least knew

03:58.331 --> 04:01.931
what colour our car should be,
so we went off to get some paint.

04:06.291 --> 04:11.530
Excuse me, you know this machine,
can you match the colours of things?

04:11.531 --> 04:12.890
Yeah, we can try.

04:12.891 --> 04:17.130
Can you match the colour of this
hearing aid, this bit,

04:17.130 --> 04:20.331
specifically that bit.
That is a symphony in beige.

04:20.332 --> 04:23.970
That's the colour we want.
Can it really do that?

04:23.971 --> 04:28.131
So analyse the colour of the hearing
aid. Can it do my left nipple?

04:32.531 --> 04:34.730
With the paint sorted,

04:34.731 --> 04:38.531
we went back to the Top Gear
Technology Centre to begin work.

04:41.131 --> 04:46.330
Look at this dash. Speedo - out
of focus. Radio - too complicated.

04:46.331 --> 04:50.010
It's all going to be changed,
all of it.

04:50.011 --> 04:53.409
I've been thinking about safety and
not just for the car's occupants.

04:53.410 --> 04:56.769
So, with that in mind, old people
find it very difficult to look around

04:56.770 --> 04:59.329
when they're reversing -
it's just a fact -

04:59.330 --> 05:02.291
so I'm planning a system
for the rear, to help them

05:02.292 --> 05:07.610
stop reversing into garage walls
and lampposts, their wives.

05:07.611 --> 05:10.929
I'm also planning
much, much bigger door mirrors.

05:10.930 --> 05:14.489
Then, at the front, a radical
redesign of the front bumper

05:14.490 --> 05:17.811
to avoid and minimise expensive
bodywork damage.

05:17.812 --> 05:19.051
I'm thinking.

05:23.731 --> 05:25.250
After several hours,

05:25.251 --> 05:28.491
Jeremy's dashboard was
beginning to take shape.

05:33.011 --> 05:35.730
Um, airbags. Yeah.

05:35.731 --> 05:39.249
Dangerous, because you're not allowed
to put children in the front seat

05:39.250 --> 05:42.729
with them there
because they're too delicate. Yeah.

05:42.730 --> 05:45.649
Old people, they tend to sit
quite far forwards even

05:45.650 --> 05:48.689
when they're not driving. And they're
just as delicate as children.

05:48.690 --> 05:52.169
There you go - danger. So I think
we get rid of them. Can I have them?

05:52.170 --> 05:54.089
Yeah, I don't need them.
I've got a plan.

05:54.090 --> 05:56.289
I'll have your airbags
out in literally...

05:56.290 --> 05:59.411
Are you sure this is...?
I'm not sure this is... Yes!

05:59.412 --> 06:04.130
But the airbag had to be defused
by cutting one of the two wires.

06:04.131 --> 06:08.370
Which one do I cut?
One presumably sets the bomb off.

06:08.371 --> 06:12.050
Well, not bomb,
but explosives. Yeah.

06:12.051 --> 06:15.369
How much explosive is in an airbag?
Quite a lot. Is there?

06:15.370 --> 06:17.811
Is it really a lot?
It is, genuinely it's a lot.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.850
You can get burns from it.
It's a lot.

06:20.851 --> 06:25.491
So let's get inside the mind of the
man who made it. He's Italian. Yeah.

06:26.811 --> 06:29.331
So if I think it's blue,
it's probably brown.

06:34.531 --> 06:38.891
Wait! Yeah, no, you see, brown - that
might be what they want you to think.

06:45.131 --> 06:49.530
Wait! Wait. What colours are in
the Italian flag?

06:49.531 --> 06:50.891
None of those.

07:06.451 --> 07:08.569
Ah, you see! It was easy!
I wasn't worried.

07:08.570 --> 07:11.131
We could just edit all that
stuff out. Yeah.

07:12.731 --> 07:16.369
While Hammond continued
with his safety features, I started

07:16.370 --> 07:20.371
making a new dashboard and soon
had something to show my colleague.

07:22.211 --> 07:25.649
You know elderly people like to
drive quite slowly?

07:25.650 --> 07:26.969
Yeah, like James. Exactly.

07:26.970 --> 07:29.129
So this is what I've done to get
round the problem.

07:29.130 --> 07:32.371
Brilliant - so it only reads 20 even
if they're doing 80 miles an hour.

07:32.372 --> 07:37.410
115! "I'm only doing 17 miles
an hour," so they're happy.

07:37.411 --> 07:40.089
The people stuck behind, whose
wives are in labour

07:40.090 --> 07:43.609
and they have meetings to get to,
they're happy. Everybody wins.

07:43.610 --> 07:47.849
'I was also rather proud of my
old-people-friendly rear fog light.'

07:47.850 --> 07:50.289
This'll be mounted in the car -
this is the switch.

07:50.290 --> 07:52.569
So as soon as it starts a little
bit of light drizzle,

07:52.570 --> 07:55.169
the elderly person
turns on the rear fog light

07:55.170 --> 07:57.611
and then what happens
round the back is...

07:57.612 --> 07:59.651
absolutely nothing at all.

08:01.411 --> 08:06.009
With the new dash sorted, I started
to think about the rear seats and I

08:06.010 --> 08:10.369
went online to search for an advert
I remembered from the early '80s.

08:10.370 --> 08:14.251
And that's it, that's it! Hammond!
Hammond! Come and look at this!

08:14.252 --> 08:16.331
Watch this commercial. Ready?

08:17.811 --> 08:19.969
It's grand to find
a comfortable chair

08:19.970 --> 08:23.329
when you're getting on a bit
or you've got arthritis.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.969
My niece got this from Shackletons,
you know.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.691
You know! You know! You know!

08:27.692 --> 08:30.970
Shackletons' original high seat.

08:30.971 --> 08:34.291
Never thought it would be
so easy to get in and out of.

08:34.292 --> 08:37.850
Shackletons' high seat chair.
It's lovely.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.208
Hang on, so you're saying
replace that with one of those?

08:41.210 --> 08:43.529
But they're so easy to get in
and out of, YOU KNOW!

08:43.530 --> 08:46.491
And it is lovely to find a nice,
high seat.

08:55.811 --> 08:58.211
Things were better in the old days.
They were. Fact.

09:09.411 --> 09:11.810
Oh! Oh-ho, oh-ho!

09:11.811 --> 09:14.650
Ohhhh...

09:14.651 --> 09:17.330
Come on, that is brilliant!

09:17.331 --> 09:20.210
'Our car was coming along nicely.

09:20.211 --> 09:23.729
'We removed the Fiat badges,
which were a bit foreign,

09:23.730 --> 09:26.771
'and replaced them
with something more appropriate.

09:28.811 --> 09:35.050
'Hammond softened the suspension
and I installed a pet cage.'

09:35.051 --> 09:36.649
A cat bolted to the roof?

09:36.650 --> 09:39.489
I'm not bolting the cat,
I'm bolting the cat cage to the roof

09:39.490 --> 09:42.369
and then it'll be up here
and I won't get asthma.

09:42.370 --> 09:45.049
'As I was busy with
my cat carrying system,

09:45.050 --> 09:48.731
'Hammond decided to make some
covers for the front seats.'

09:49.851 --> 09:54.010
Weirdly, I've used this
as my inspiration. It's a BAC Mono.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.329
Because it's a track car,
it's got no roof or doors or windows,

09:57.330 --> 10:00.929
so they line the interior with
this special material.

10:00.930 --> 10:02.131
I've got some here.

10:02.132 --> 10:03.690
In beige, obviously.

10:03.691 --> 10:07.730
Now, it's quite plush,
it feels like suede or even velvet,

10:07.731 --> 10:10.851
but when it gets wet,
here's the strange thing -

10:10.852 --> 10:12.490
the water just runs off.

10:12.491 --> 10:15.489
Look at that! You'd think it would
be ruined, but it just flies away.

10:15.490 --> 10:19.291
I'm going to use it to make what
I shall call inconti seat covers.

10:31.731 --> 10:38.250
By the evening, our car was almost
finished, but we felt a bit strange.

10:38.251 --> 10:41.209
What's extraordinary about today
is that, without James here, there

10:41.210 --> 10:45.489
have been no arguments, nobody's
caught fire, nobody's fallen over.

10:45.490 --> 10:47.489
We've been like a well-oiled machine

10:47.490 --> 10:51.531
and I think we've created something
really rather brilliant.

10:51.532 --> 10:54.211
And with that, back to the studio.

11:01.491 --> 11:04.569
The thing is, I've just got
a question, actually.

11:04.570 --> 11:05.769
What do you do...?

11:05.770 --> 11:09.049
While we're on the subject of old
people, what do you do when you know

11:09.050 --> 11:13.489
that your mother or father is really
too old to be driving any more.

11:13.490 --> 11:16.289
Good question. You can't really say,
"Hand over your license."

11:16.290 --> 11:19.409
I think that's why
our car makes so much sense.

11:19.410 --> 11:22.129
Yeah, and we shall see how it
does in a road test later on.

11:22.130 --> 11:25.129
What happened to your eye?
Nothing, nothing at all.

11:25.130 --> 11:28.009
No, because you weren't there
with your slap-happy attitude,

11:28.010 --> 11:31.089
no part of the needle of
the sewing machine went in it.

11:31.090 --> 11:35.209
Not even a tiny... No, not even
a tiny bit. No. No. So, the news.

11:35.210 --> 11:38.489
You know there's a new Volkswagen
Golf? Yes. Very nice, actually.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.091
But in four months
there'll be a GTI version of it.

11:41.092 --> 11:44.170
Now, that will have
217 horsepower...

11:44.171 --> 11:47.730
Or no, actually,
it's German - cowpower.

11:47.731 --> 11:51.329
217 cowpower engine
and it's going to be about £25,000.

11:51.330 --> 11:54.889
Thing is, though, there's going to
be a rival for this.

11:54.890 --> 11:57.929
You know the car we looked at
last week, the Kia Cee'd, well,

11:57.930 --> 12:01.489
look at this. This is the...
They're calling it the Pro Cee'd GT.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.369
I think that looks rather good.
It does.

12:03.370 --> 12:05.649
And it's two grand less than
the Volkswagen.

12:05.650 --> 12:07.049
Nearly three grand less.

12:07.050 --> 12:10.049
And the thing I like about that is
they haven't gone absolutely

12:10.050 --> 12:13.969
mad with it. It's a 1.6 litre turbo,
200 horsepower, which is...

12:13.970 --> 12:17.971
Well, no, it's not horsepower.
It's Korean. It's dogpower, yeah.

12:17.972 --> 12:19.650
Exactly, yeah.

12:19.651 --> 12:22.289
I tell you what, though, if you
don't want to spend that much,

12:22.290 --> 12:24.209
the reason we bring these
hot hatchbacks up

12:24.210 --> 12:26.929
is, Volkswagen has announced,
you know the Up, which we love?

12:26.930 --> 12:29.289
It's a great little car.
Really brilliant little car.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.969
They've announced they're doing
a GT version of it here, OK?

12:31.970 --> 12:34.571
Now, this is going to
have 110 horsepower,

12:34.572 --> 12:37.730
so exactly the same
as the original Golf GTI.

12:37.731 --> 12:40.891
It's smaller than an original Golf
GTI, it weighs less than a tonne.

12:40.892 --> 12:44.490
I reckon that will be epic
and it's £13,000!

12:44.491 --> 12:46.249
No, I think that could be brilliant.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.171
So if you have ordered
a new car for later this year,

12:49.172 --> 12:53.290
S Class, Lamborghini,
whatever it is, cancel your order.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.569
You want one of those.
You do. That is going to...

12:55.570 --> 12:57.129
I can't wait to drive that.

12:57.130 --> 13:00.209
There is another version of the Mini,
yet another. Not another!

13:00.210 --> 13:02.289
Another one.
We needed one in 20 minutes.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.571
It's out, this month it's on sale.
It's called the Paceman, here it is.

13:05.572 --> 13:09.330
Oh, look at it!
It's so miserable! It's little face!

13:09.331 --> 13:12.291
I saw one coming the other way,
coming into work the other day,

13:12.292 --> 13:15.410
and it just looked
so catastrophically sad.

13:15.411 --> 13:18.490
"Morning, it's all awful!

13:18.491 --> 13:20.490
"I hate being a Mini!

13:20.491 --> 13:25.610
"I have to sleep outside and
a dog weed on my wheel last night.

13:25.611 --> 13:28.851
"All the big cars steal
my pencil money." Look at it!

13:28.852 --> 13:33.970
Hammond, do that face again.
You do look incredibly like it!

13:33.971 --> 13:35.291
You do look like the...

13:38.771 --> 13:41.449
It's so depressing!
Why have they done that?

13:41.450 --> 13:43.969
I tell you what, though,
for radiator grilles,

13:43.970 --> 13:45.649
have you seen the new Lexus IS?

13:45.650 --> 13:48.771
Oh! That's like it's got
a vacuum cleaner on the front!

13:49.931 --> 13:53.051
You'd have to lift your feet
as it goes past!

13:53.052 --> 13:56.570
How hard can it be to do
a radiator grille?

13:56.571 --> 13:57.890
Hey, bad news.

13:57.891 --> 13:59.929
You know when the Tories
came to power they said

13:59.930 --> 14:02.609
they were going to up the motorway
speed limit to 80? Yeah.

14:02.610 --> 14:06.571
Well, the new Transport Secretary
who's called something dreary -

14:06.572 --> 14:10.370
Patrick McLoughlin -
has had a rethink. Oh, God.

14:10.371 --> 14:13.410
No, he says that he's unlikely to
up it to

14:13.411 --> 14:19.890
80 because in his
constituency there's a very bad
road where a lot of people get hurt.

14:19.891 --> 14:21.889
Yeah, this is quite interesting,
isn't it?

14:21.890 --> 14:23.849
His constituency is
the Derbyshire Dales

14:23.850 --> 14:26.809
and we had a look at a map
and there are no motorways there.

14:26.810 --> 14:29.049
What this means,
ladies and gentlemen,

14:29.050 --> 14:31.569
is our Transport Secretary
in Great Britain

14:31.570 --> 14:33.451
doesn't know what a motorway is.

14:33.452 --> 14:36.090
The man is a blithering idiot.

14:36.091 --> 14:39.889
No, but in all seriousness,
you can't really have a Minister

14:39.890 --> 14:43.649
for Transport who isn't interested
in, for example, cars and roads.

14:43.650 --> 14:47.449
It's be like making you
the Governor of the Bank Of England.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.489
Don't do that. No, cos he's not
interested in the economy.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.969
No, but I could sort it out. How?

14:51.970 --> 14:54.809
Well, I could sort out
the budget deficit.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.489
Well, I'd find out how much it was

14:56.490 --> 14:59.609
and then I'd write a cheque for that
amount from the Bank Of England.

14:59.610 --> 15:01.529
He probably has a point!
That could do it.

15:01.530 --> 15:04.169
Well, maybe he should...
That's economics covered.

15:04.170 --> 15:08.691
I'd also have minted a £9.99 note
to make life easier for shopkeepers.

15:09.731 --> 15:12.849
Can I just say, actually,
changing the motorway speed limit

15:12.850 --> 15:14.009
to 80 miles an hour

15:14.010 --> 15:17.049
wouldn't actually make a blind
bit of difference, would it?

15:17.050 --> 15:21.089
Because everybody in the outside
lane of the motorway is doing 95.

15:21.090 --> 15:24.889
They are. No, they are. People go,
"Everyone does 80 on the motorway,"

15:24.890 --> 15:27.169
and they don't,
they're doing 95 in the outside.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.889
So all an 80-mph speed limit would do

15:28.890 --> 15:31.129
is reduce the income
from speeding fines,

15:31.130 --> 15:34.451
cos you're only going to be doing
15 miles an hour over the limit

15:34.452 --> 15:36.770
rather than 25. The fact is

15:36.771 --> 15:39.729
that on a weekday afternoon -
I'm not talking about weekends

15:39.730 --> 15:42.209
when the roads are clogged up
with people in Peugeots

15:42.210 --> 15:44.171
going to B&Q
to buy more hideous decking.

15:44.172 --> 15:46.930
I'm talking about
a weekday afternoon,

15:46.931 --> 15:49.409
Britain has the best
standard of driving

15:49.410 --> 15:51.169
you'll find anywhere in the world.

15:51.170 --> 15:54.449
You're right. I would agree
with that. It's a big claim.

15:54.450 --> 15:57.209
Is it? Right, let's run through
the opposition, shall we?

15:57.210 --> 15:59.329
The Germans all do
150 on the autobahn

15:59.330 --> 16:02.329
that far behind the car in front.
They do. The Italians are mad.

16:02.330 --> 16:05.809
The French can't get to the grocers
without crashing into a field.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.569
The Americans are belligerent,
the Australians are drunk,

16:08.570 --> 16:11.011
the rest of the world
hasn't got the hang of it yet.

16:12.451 --> 16:15.050
No, I'll... Yeah.

16:15.051 --> 16:17.011
Hang on. No. What?

16:18.531 --> 16:19.890
What about...

16:19.891 --> 16:22.529
What about the Scandinavians?
Cos they're pretty handy.

16:22.530 --> 16:25.209
No, they're not half as good
as they think they are. Really?

16:25.210 --> 16:27.731
They always say, "I can drive..."
I won't do the accent.

16:27.732 --> 16:30.331
"I can drive..."

16:31.531 --> 16:33.489
Overreached yourself there,
didn't you?

16:33.490 --> 16:36.169
They always say, "I can drive
at 75 miles an hour on sheet ice,"

16:36.170 --> 16:39.089
and that's true, they can, but they
don't tell you the other thing -

16:39.090 --> 16:40.529
they crash all the time!

16:40.530 --> 16:43.329
There isn't a florist window
anywhere in Scandinavia

16:43.330 --> 16:45.769
that hasn't got a crashed van
halfway through it.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.209
They just spin off constantly.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.769
They do. OK, so scrub
the Scandinavians. We are the best.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.769
We are just the best,
and that's an end of it.

16:51.770 --> 16:54.049
I think we should have a campaign,
a global one,

16:54.050 --> 16:57.811
posters by the motorway
with a Lord Kitchener-type figure on

16:57.812 --> 17:01.091
that says, "Think -
what would the British do?"

17:02.411 --> 17:05.209
Oh, Alfa Romeo, they have
a proud history, don't they,

17:05.210 --> 17:08.251
of really excellent names,
evocative, emotive, names -

17:08.252 --> 17:10.290
Giulia, Spider,

17:10.290 --> 17:12.608
Giulietta, Stradale, all great names.

17:12.609 --> 17:15.611
Well, they've released photographs
of a new Alfa. Here it is.

17:15.612 --> 17:17.650
Mmm. Lovely. Lovely.

17:17.651 --> 17:20.010
Except, it's called the Gloria.

17:20.011 --> 17:22.730
The what? Gloria? That is Gloria.

17:22.731 --> 17:25.691
You're looking at Gloria. Gloria's
not the name of an Italian car.

17:25.692 --> 17:28.410
Gloria is the name
of a receptionist.

17:28.411 --> 17:31.849
Yeah. Gloria has her glasses
on a chain around her neck.

17:31.850 --> 17:35.571
Gloria wears... What's it called
when tights are really thick?

17:35.572 --> 17:37.730
Is that 50 denier or 100?

17:37.731 --> 17:39.731
That would be 100. 100? Right.

17:39.732 --> 17:44.490
Gloria wears 100-denier tights
and they rasp when she walks.

17:44.491 --> 17:47.209
We went off topic quite badly.
We have gone very off topic.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.169
Anyway, listen,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:49.170 --> 17:51.609
this morning,
Richard Hammond was late for work.

17:51.610 --> 17:54.371
Oh, I'm sorry! I know!
I arrived at 8:07.

17:54.372 --> 17:57.650
You got there at 8:10.
You arrived at 10:47.

17:57.651 --> 18:00.369
Yes. I'm sorry.
10 to 11 when you arrived.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.849
I'm sorry I was late for school!
And this was good news

18:02.850 --> 18:05.569
because, while we were waiting
for you to rock up, James and I

18:05.570 --> 18:08.769
talked about the enormous success
we had last week playing car rugby.

18:08.770 --> 18:11.809
Exactly. And I think it was a great
success, and we were thinking,

18:11.810 --> 18:14.889
"Are there any other sports
you can play in a car?" Were you?

18:14.890 --> 18:18.129
Now, you were so late, we decided to
go out onto the track to see

18:18.130 --> 18:19.771
if you can play tennis in a car.

18:19.772 --> 18:21.490
You can't. You can't?

18:21.491 --> 18:23.490
No. Really?

18:23.491 --> 18:25.889
Well, we had a couple
of cameramen out there,

18:25.890 --> 18:27.649
so let's just find out, shall we?

18:27.650 --> 18:29.811
Here we go.
This is how we filled our morning.

18:30.931 --> 18:32.210
Serve!

18:32.211 --> 18:34.171
Here we go, this is a good one.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.250
Whoa-ho!

18:46.251 --> 18:48.971
That's a great shot! Yes!

18:52.811 --> 18:53.970
What? It works!

18:53.971 --> 18:56.091
I know, it does.
You can play tennis in cars,

18:56.092 --> 18:57.650
with a bit of editing!

18:57.651 --> 19:00.289
Little bit of editing.
It did work really well, though.

19:00.290 --> 19:03.129
And it was really good fun.
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.089
Now, moving on, sometimes it seems

19:05.090 --> 19:08.489
like the motor industry is
a little bit like the film business.

19:08.490 --> 19:12.409
Occasionally you get low-budget
indies like the Ariel Atom.

19:12.410 --> 19:16.491
Sometimes you get a quirky, offbeat
foreign-language production.

19:16.492 --> 19:17.970
That'd be a Saab.

19:17.971 --> 19:22.730
And then occasionally, you get
a big, huge-budget blockbuster,

19:22.731 --> 19:24.411
such as this.

19:50.171 --> 19:53.371
Welcome, everyone,
to the new Range Rover.

19:55.691 --> 19:57.650
And when I say new,

19:57.651 --> 20:00.251
I really mean new.

20:01.891 --> 20:05.329
This body shell, for example, still
looks pretty much like a Range Rover

20:05.330 --> 20:07.851
but it's been totally
redesigned from scratch

20:07.852 --> 20:10.330
and made from aluminium,

20:10.331 --> 20:15.651
and that saves a whopping
400 kilograms of weight.

20:16.891 --> 20:18.811
And that's just the start of it.

20:21.411 --> 20:25.689
It has a new active suspension
system, so it no longer rolls around

20:25.690 --> 20:28.531
like a torpedoed frigate
when you go round the bends.

20:28.532 --> 20:31.410
It has new electric power steering,

20:31.411 --> 20:34.211
it has a new,
very clever eight-speed gearbox.

20:37.011 --> 20:40.409
Inside, half of the switches
and buttons have been ditched

20:40.410 --> 20:42.891
to create this
more minimalist dashboard.

20:45.931 --> 20:49.731
There are also four inches
of extra legroom in the back,

20:49.732 --> 20:54.251
and you no longer have to burn
any calories opening the tailgate.

20:57.891 --> 21:01.651
On the road,
it feels more luxurious than ever.

21:02.891 --> 21:05.450
The ride is really very good,

21:05.451 --> 21:07.411
quite Rolls-Royce-like.

21:08.491 --> 21:11.571
However, all these improvements
come at a price,

21:11.572 --> 21:17.570
because even the cheapest version,
a V6 diesel, costs £71,000

21:17.571 --> 21:22.290
and the supercharged V8 model
is almost £100,000.

21:22.291 --> 21:25.050
That's Mercedes S-class money.

21:25.051 --> 21:29.970
But then, the Range Rover has
long been a Mercedes S-class rival

21:29.971 --> 21:32.410
and this new one is equally at home

21:32.411 --> 21:35.770
on the expensive bits
of the Monopoly board.

21:35.771 --> 21:39.889
Thing is, though, previous Range
Rovers have always been about

21:39.890 --> 21:43.331
a bit more than just
poncing around a nice big city.

21:43.332 --> 21:46.970
They've always been
formidable adventure cars,

21:46.971 --> 21:49.251
great off-roaders,
pioneers, in a way.

21:50.291 --> 21:53.891
So what I think we'll do now is,
we'll drive out of London...

21:55.011 --> 21:57.771
and into this place.

22:09.731 --> 22:12.810
The Nevada Automotive Test Centre

22:12.811 --> 22:14.251
in Nevada.

22:15.491 --> 22:18.810
This vast 1,200-square-mile
proving ground

22:18.811 --> 22:21.409
is where the original Hummer
was developed,

22:21.410 --> 22:23.089
making it the perfect place

22:23.090 --> 22:26.571
to find out whether Lord Snooty
can still get his shoes dirty.

22:28.771 --> 22:30.249
To spice things up a bit,

22:30.250 --> 22:33.329
we're going to give
the Range Rover some competition.

22:33.330 --> 22:35.529
So now, obviously,
you're expecting me

22:35.530 --> 22:38.771
to introduce a redneck in
a massively modified jeep.

22:40.211 --> 22:43.010
But no. We can do better than that.

22:43.011 --> 22:45.691
And we have. And here he comes now.

22:49.251 --> 22:52.971
Though when I say "he",
what I really mean is "it".

22:59.371 --> 23:00.491
Bloody Nora.

23:10.531 --> 23:12.610
Meet the TerraMax.

23:12.611 --> 23:16.530
It has six-wheel drive,
tyres the size of Ferris wheels,

23:16.531 --> 23:18.651
the ability to drive almost anywhere

23:18.652 --> 23:20.410
and, as you've just seen,

23:20.411 --> 23:22.371
nobody in the driver's seat.

23:26.851 --> 23:28.970
It's an autonomous vehicle.

23:28.971 --> 23:32.290
This thing can go on patrol,
deliver supplies,

23:32.291 --> 23:36.770
and all without any risk of
soldiers being blown up by IEDs.

23:36.771 --> 23:39.330
Here's basically how it works.

23:39.331 --> 23:42.009
Up on the roof,
there's a thing called LIDAR,

23:42.010 --> 23:45.649
which is 64 separate lasers spinning
round and round very quickly

23:45.650 --> 23:47.209
and reading the terrain.

23:47.210 --> 23:50.849
The information that comes back is
interpreted by the computer on board

23:50.850 --> 23:52.609
that decides where it should go

23:52.610 --> 23:56.331
and then operates the steering,
the brakes, the engine and so on.

23:57.611 --> 23:59.851
And what it sees is this.

24:01.011 --> 24:05.130
Anything that comes up green
is basically no problem.

24:05.131 --> 24:07.089
It's vegetation, that sort of thing.

24:07.090 --> 24:09.529
Anything that comes up
in various shades of red

24:09.530 --> 24:14.169
is more of an obstacle, so a big
rock, a tree, a wall, a cliff face,

24:14.170 --> 24:15.491
all that sort of thing.

24:21.371 --> 24:22.571
Look at that!

24:24.531 --> 24:26.251
That's really quite amazing.

24:27.411 --> 24:29.330
But the big question is,

24:29.331 --> 24:31.611
can it beat a car built by Brummies

24:31.612 --> 24:33.571
and driven by me?

24:38.931 --> 24:41.291
What we're going to do
is have a race

24:41.292 --> 24:43.970
from here to that hilltop
over there,

24:43.971 --> 24:46.290
a distance of about ten miles.

24:46.291 --> 24:50.011
Between us and the finish line
lay many off-road challenges,

24:50.012 --> 24:53.250
including rocky ground,
steep slopes,

24:53.251 --> 24:56.050
cloying mud and icy rivers.

24:56.051 --> 24:58.809
And there would be
no pre-planned route.

24:58.810 --> 25:02.571
The Range Rover and I would have
to adapt as we went along.

25:04.251 --> 25:06.331
ENGINES RUMBLE

25:08.451 --> 25:11.010
It's man versus machine,

25:11.011 --> 25:12.451
quite literally.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.291
Three!

25:17.651 --> 25:19.131
Hang on!

25:21.971 --> 25:24.531
I suppose it has a mind of its own,
doesn't it?

25:26.891 --> 25:29.011
It's May versus Schwarzenegger!

25:33.211 --> 25:36.049
In truth, the jump start
didn't really matter

25:36.050 --> 25:38.409
because I was on standard road tyres

25:38.410 --> 25:42.451
and this path was so craggy, he was
always going to be faster anyway.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.209
Look at the size of the tyres
on that thing.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.089
Ah, God, he's miles in front.

25:49.090 --> 25:52.129
Right, if you're thinking of
placing a bet on this at home,

25:52.130 --> 25:54.969
here are the odds.
Team Terminator, with the TerraMax,

25:54.970 --> 25:57.411
they can go over terrain
that I can't manage,

25:57.412 --> 25:59.570
and the boffins who built it

25:59.571 --> 26:03.691
have programmed satellite maps
of the whole area into its brain.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.489
So it already has a pretty good idea
of where to go.

26:07.490 --> 26:10.971
And if they want, they can
take control of it remotely,

26:10.972 --> 26:12.531
like a drone.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.531
Team Top Gear, with the Range Rover,

26:15.532 --> 26:20.250
you have me, possibly the greatest
off-road vehicle in the world,

26:20.251 --> 26:22.570
and higher speed.

26:22.571 --> 26:26.210
I also have Land Rover's
Terrain Response system,

26:26.211 --> 26:29.289
which allows you to select
different settings for the car

26:29.290 --> 26:31.851
depending on the type
of surface you're on.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.250
But there is a new feature -

26:35.251 --> 26:37.009
you can now push the knob down

26:37.010 --> 26:38.689
and it goes into automatic mode,

26:38.690 --> 26:42.249
and then the car will work out
for itself, believe it or not,

26:42.250 --> 26:44.049
what sort of terrain you're on,

26:44.050 --> 26:46.611
what ride height you need,
all the rest of it.

26:48.331 --> 26:50.689
Right now, though,
it was speed I needed,

26:50.690 --> 26:54.371
and with these tyres on this terrain
I wasn't getting any.

26:56.011 --> 26:57.651
God above!

26:59.051 --> 27:00.611
That looks like a short cut.

27:02.531 --> 27:04.571
That is a short cut. I'll miss this.

27:05.691 --> 27:09.530
The short cut was
a steep, slippery slope.

27:09.531 --> 27:11.691
Right, hill descent.

27:15.131 --> 27:16.491
Here we go.

27:17.571 --> 27:18.851
Whoa!

27:20.691 --> 27:22.051
Whoa, that's steep.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.571
I'm losing it! No, I'm not!

27:30.211 --> 27:31.611
Whoa-ho!

27:32.931 --> 27:35.131
Oh, God, he's there.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.530
And sure enough...

27:38.531 --> 27:40.451
Yes! Take that, Robocop!

27:43.011 --> 27:45.009
And things could only get better

27:45.010 --> 27:48.011
because ahead of me
lay a fast, sandy track.

27:54.491 --> 27:55.571
Wahey!

27:58.251 --> 28:02.570
This is the 510-horsepower
supercharged Range Rover.

28:02.571 --> 28:06.450
You'd be mad to buy this in Britain.
It's so thirsty!

28:06.451 --> 28:09.411
Makes sense out here, though,
and it makes sense doing this.

28:14.771 --> 28:17.051
I've no idea where Robocop is.

28:18.411 --> 28:20.531
But he ain't going as fast as this.

28:22.211 --> 28:24.930
Sadly, Robocop didn't need to,

28:24.931 --> 28:28.769
because the boffins back at base
switched to drone mode,

28:28.770 --> 28:32.729
remotely deflated the tyres for
better grip in tricky conditions

28:32.730 --> 28:35.571
and ordered it to take
a short cut of its own,

28:35.572 --> 28:37.331
over even rougher ground.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.130
Wahey!

28:46.131 --> 28:47.810
Back on the sand track,

28:47.811 --> 28:50.089
I was at least reaping the benefits

28:50.090 --> 28:52.731
of the Range Rover's
400-kilogram diet.

28:54.491 --> 28:57.489
Hang on, a quick downshift
to the sandy hairpin.

28:57.490 --> 28:59.211
Look at that, it's beautiful!

29:01.931 --> 29:05.170
But the TerraMax's shortcut
had put it ahead

29:05.171 --> 29:08.091
and now the terrain was
even more in its favour.

29:18.891 --> 29:23.091
That thing's not going fast, but it
is utterly relentless. It just goes.

29:32.331 --> 29:33.610
Moments later,

29:33.611 --> 29:37.211
I arrived at the ridge
the TerraMax had just climbed.

29:38.691 --> 29:40.091
Holy moly!

29:41.091 --> 29:42.691
What the hell, here we go.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.411
Geronimo!

29:49.331 --> 29:50.811
Whoa!

29:54.651 --> 29:56.370
Did you see that?

29:56.371 --> 29:58.851
That is just... That is astounding!

30:01.971 --> 30:05.091
Meanwhile, the TerraMax
was surging ahead.

30:08.691 --> 30:11.290
And once it had crossed the river

30:11.291 --> 30:16.410
it could hit its top speed
of 35 miles an hour,

30:16.411 --> 30:19.531
which meant
I had to push even harder.

30:24.571 --> 30:26.571
Whoa, that's deep.

30:28.571 --> 30:31.091
Whoa, that's getting a bit dicey!

30:32.691 --> 30:33.851
Whoa!

30:35.651 --> 30:37.251
Whoa-ho!

30:38.371 --> 30:40.891
It really is astonishing,
this thing.

30:42.251 --> 30:45.370
Let's hear you cheering, Birmingham.

30:45.371 --> 30:50.250
Here we go. This will wade
up to 36 inches, this car.

30:50.251 --> 30:52.689
That's more than
a Land Rover Defender,

30:52.690 --> 30:55.649
more than the old car would.
The air intakes have been moved up

30:55.650 --> 30:58.609
to the top of the bonnet, so
the water doesn't get in the engine.

30:58.610 --> 31:00.411
If there's no holes in the river,

31:00.412 --> 31:03.211
I'm across! Yes!

31:08.691 --> 31:12.970
Back on smooth ground,
I could now close down the TerraMax.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.290
Where is he?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.371
No sign of the metal bastard.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.490
Actually, the driverless swine

31:21.491 --> 31:23.971
was starting its ascent
of the final hill.

31:26.971 --> 31:30.091
There's Arnie! I'm on his six.

31:31.251 --> 31:33.889
Now, I could follow that thing,
then just try and overtake

31:33.890 --> 31:36.009
at the last minute
in a rush to the finish line,

31:36.010 --> 31:38.249
but I don't think that will work,
to be honest,

31:38.250 --> 31:41.411
cos it's just going to end up
somewhere where I can't go.

31:43.091 --> 31:45.531
On the map,
Arnie's route was shorter

31:45.532 --> 31:47.850
but also clearly steeper,

31:47.851 --> 31:51.051
so I went for
a longer, shallower track.

31:55.211 --> 31:57.171
Here we go.
And it's smooth and good.

31:59.371 --> 32:03.051
That's where I'm going. I can see
a whiff of the orange smoke.

32:06.251 --> 32:07.891
Heh-heh! This is excellent.

32:09.371 --> 32:11.490
Lost sight of Arnie.

32:11.491 --> 32:13.891
Absolutely no idea where it is.

32:16.651 --> 32:19.291
Whilst Arnie ploughed
relentlessly upwards,

32:19.292 --> 32:22.091
my gamble started to backfire.

32:26.651 --> 32:29.451
This is getting tricky. Ah!
Calm down, man.

32:33.131 --> 32:34.451
Jeez, it's getting worse.

32:37.931 --> 32:41.529
I'm sorry, I really can't
do it much faster than this.

32:41.530 --> 32:45.929
I'll just pull a tyre off or smack
something, then it will be over.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.371
The summit was now
just half a mile away.

32:49.851 --> 32:52.489
He could be just
the other side of that rise.

32:52.490 --> 32:54.611
I just... I've got no way
of knowing.

32:56.531 --> 32:58.650
There's the orange smoke.

32:58.651 --> 33:00.810
Here we go, here we go.

33:00.811 --> 33:03.891
Here's the chequered flag! And...

33:05.571 --> 33:07.171
No TerraMax!

33:08.211 --> 33:10.571
Yes! Ha-ha!

33:11.651 --> 33:14.210
I thank you!

33:14.211 --> 33:17.929
How about that? An intelligent
machine driven by a computer

33:17.930 --> 33:21.569
has been beaten by the intelligent
machine driven by a human being,

33:21.570 --> 33:23.889
which is exactly as
it should be, of course.

33:23.890 --> 33:27.529
We... are still the most
important component in a car,

33:27.530 --> 33:30.091
and if we weren't,
we'd all be doomed!

33:45.291 --> 33:46.730
Why...

33:46.731 --> 33:49.890
Why can't you walk
on slippery surfaces?

33:49.891 --> 33:53.529
I don't like low traction. Yeah, but
why do you need traction? It's you.

33:53.530 --> 33:56.729
You're not moving quickly or
changing direction suddenly, are you?

33:56.730 --> 33:58.009
No, and the other thing is,

33:58.010 --> 34:01.129
I think I could have done the
Range Rover test a bit more quickly.

34:01.130 --> 34:03.289
Really? No, you could.
All you have to say is,

34:03.290 --> 34:05.049
at the front there's too much bling,

34:05.050 --> 34:06.689
at the back the boot is too small,

34:06.690 --> 34:10.009
and everything in between
is utterly, utterly outstanding.

34:10.010 --> 34:12.609
You could have added
that because it's so much lighter

34:12.610 --> 34:14.969
than the previous model,
it's much more economical.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.168
Yeah. There we are,
we've covered everything.

34:17.170 --> 34:19.569
Could we get onto
that TerraMax, actually? Yes.

34:19.570 --> 34:23.609
Cos that was built to take supplies
to the front line in a battlefield.

34:23.610 --> 34:26.248
That's the idea, that
you don't endanger any soldiers.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.649
You send the truck by itself.
And that makes sense

34:28.650 --> 34:31.289
but you know Google,
and indeed, Oxford University

34:31.290 --> 34:34.449
are currently working on a
driverless car that we can all buy,

34:34.449 --> 34:36.610
and I'm sorry
but I can't see the point.

34:36.612 --> 34:38.010
No, neither can I.

34:38.011 --> 34:42.570
"My car has arrived at work.
I'm not in it, but..."

34:42.571 --> 34:45.248
"I sent the car into town
to do the shopping!"

34:45.250 --> 34:47.969
Pity it hasn't got any arms.
The school run, perhaps,

34:47.969 --> 34:50.248
you could send the kids off
while you stay in bed

34:50.250 --> 34:52.489
but other than that,
utterly pointless.

34:52.489 --> 34:56.411
Anyway, it's now time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

34:56.411 --> 35:00.650
Now, my guest tonight likes bikes
and is incredibly tiny.

35:00.651 --> 35:05.650
Oh, is it me?! Have you ever seen
Keira Knightley naked?

35:05.651 --> 35:07.330
Yes. Really?

35:07.331 --> 35:10.971
No. Well, he has, and he's kissed
Angelina Jolie. Oh, I've done that!

35:10.972 --> 35:12.890
No, you haven't. In my mind.

35:12.891 --> 35:15.251
Ladies and gentlemen, James McAvoy!

35:18.291 --> 35:21.731
How are you? Good. Nice to see you.
Thank you very much.

35:22.971 --> 35:24.770
Have a seat.

35:24.771 --> 35:31.410
So Atonement, Last King Of Scotland,
X-Men, and now you crown it all.

35:31.411 --> 35:34.129
The Bill. I was in The Bill. The
Bill, as well? I was in The Bill.

35:34.130 --> 35:37.371
You don't crown that, but this is
Top Gear - second best to The Bill.

35:37.372 --> 35:38.530
Yes!

35:38.531 --> 35:42.251
Now, the guests we've had recently -
Mick Fleetwood, Amy Macdonald -

35:42.252 --> 35:47.130
really quite good car histories.
Yours is shocking. Is it? OK.

35:47.131 --> 35:50.491
I think you're the first man we've
ever had sit in that seat

35:50.492 --> 35:53.210
who once owned a Nissan Micra. Oh!

35:53.211 --> 35:56.129
Listen, I was very proud of that car
and I have to say,

35:56.130 --> 35:59.571
that car was not even one litre
and it went like the clappers!

35:59.572 --> 36:01.890
It didn't. It did. Oh, no!

36:01.891 --> 36:05.051
No, no, because you moved from that
to something not much better.

36:05.052 --> 36:08.170
It was called a Renault Clio.

36:08.171 --> 36:10.650
And it was a 1.2.

36:10.651 --> 36:13.330
Five door, my friend!

36:13.331 --> 36:16.930
And it had a fantastic
heating system. Did it?

36:16.931 --> 36:20.371
It did, it warmed up very quickly,
much warmer than my new car,

36:20.372 --> 36:22.570
which is an Audi Q3 now.

36:22.571 --> 36:27.089
I actually said the other day,
it's the dreariest car in the world.

36:27.090 --> 36:29.729
But anyway, let's gloss over that.
Right, go.

36:29.730 --> 36:33.129
Because the problem you had is you
didn't pass your driving test

36:33.130 --> 36:37.011
till really quite recently.
I passed it about four years ago.

36:37.012 --> 36:41.810
I first took my driving test
for a TV show called State Of Play

36:41.811 --> 36:43.170
and then failed.

36:43.171 --> 36:46.369
So I just thought, "To hell with
it," and I started riding motorbikes

36:46.370 --> 36:48.769
and then four years ago
I was having a baby

36:48.770 --> 36:51.929
so I thought I'd better learn how to
drive and I finally passed my test.

36:51.930 --> 36:54.129
I was just thinking,
there was a Channel 4 thing

36:54.130 --> 36:56.369
called Shameless you were in. Mm.

36:56.370 --> 36:58.449
You drove in that,
I'm sure you drove.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.249
I played a car thief in that
and I have to say...

37:01.250 --> 37:04.531
I have to say, that Channel 4
never once asked me

37:04.532 --> 37:08.970
for a driver's license, so how
they got insurance, I don't know!

37:08.971 --> 37:13.010
Now, you say you
were into bikes before cars,

37:13.011 --> 37:15.130
so what was your first bike?

37:15.131 --> 37:20.051
My first bike was not really a bike,
my first bike was a Vespa. Oh, God!

37:20.052 --> 37:22.330
It was a scooter.

37:22.331 --> 37:24.931
I drove one of those
all the way across Vietnam

37:24.932 --> 37:29.050
and they are death traps. Right.
Did you fall off yours?

37:29.051 --> 37:30.570
I did fall off mine.

37:30.571 --> 37:35.010
Within...28 hours of owning one
for the first time,

37:35.011 --> 37:38.649
I found myself illegally,
by accident, on the North Circular.

37:38.650 --> 37:41.329
I was at... you know those big
roundabout junctions

37:41.330 --> 37:45.289
you get on the North Circular,
with a guy in a Maserati behind me,

37:45.290 --> 37:47.249
revving his engine and beeping me

37:47.250 --> 37:49.489
because he was angry that
I was on the North Circular.

37:49.490 --> 37:51.649
I thought, "I'm trying to get off -
give me a break."

37:51.650 --> 37:54.329
So the lights go green
and I was under so much pressure

37:54.330 --> 37:55.809
that I revved off too quickly

37:55.810 --> 37:58.609
and, going round a corner,
you know you get all that dust

37:58.610 --> 38:00.569
and gravel at the edge,
I went into it.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.689
The thing span away from me
and went about 30 feet down the road

38:03.690 --> 38:06.769
and that was my second day
as a biker, so... That was...

38:06.770 --> 38:10.131
Cos I can remember once, being in a
Maserati on the North Circular...

38:12.851 --> 38:15.409
No, I'll gloss over that.
A green Vespa, yeah?

38:15.410 --> 38:19.689
Anyway, your new film, which I went
to see last night. Right. It's good.

38:19.690 --> 38:22.529
Thanks very much, cheers. Good!
Yeah, we're very proud of it.

38:22.530 --> 38:23.969
It's called Welcome To The Punch.

38:23.970 --> 38:27.051
We have a clip,
which I'd like to show for you now.

38:27.052 --> 38:28.211
Sternwood!

38:33.451 --> 38:35.731
Can we just take
a step back for a minute?

38:36.891 --> 38:39.651
Max is an inch away from piecing
all this together.

38:47.651 --> 38:49.371
Move! Go!

38:52.091 --> 38:53.451
We'll end this tonight.

38:55.851 --> 38:58.051
And when it's over,
you'll go to prison.

39:08.011 --> 39:10.291
Why don't we let off some fireworks
while we're at it?

39:11.971 --> 39:14.371
That is properly good.

39:16.851 --> 39:19.969
I really did enjoy that,
but a couple of questions from that.

39:19.970 --> 39:23.009
Number one -
that's an Alpha 159 you're driving.

39:23.010 --> 39:25.009
Did you not think
when you were driving that,

39:25.010 --> 39:26.889
"This is better
than my Audi Q3?"

39:26.890 --> 39:28.931
I didn't have an Audi Q3
at the time,

39:28.932 --> 39:32.170
I think I had a Citroen C3 Picasso.
Ugh!

39:32.171 --> 39:34.450
This gets worse!

39:34.451 --> 39:38.089
The other thing I noticed in that is
your beard, which you still have.

39:38.090 --> 39:42.009
Now, this is because you're in...
Macbeth. I'm trans-gingered.

39:42.010 --> 39:46.051
Were you surprised when you grew it
and it was orange? Er...

39:48.091 --> 39:50.889
You know, your hair's not orange.
And I'm not orange down there.

39:50.890 --> 39:54.769
You're not orange there? People
ask me do I dye my top, but I don't.

39:54.770 --> 39:57.649
So do you know why it's orange?
Was it disappointing to be orange?

39:57.650 --> 39:59.689
I don't know why it's red,
but I dig it, I like it.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.769
I don't need a comment,
but I like it. I'm...

40:02.770 --> 40:04.451
I'm fine with an orange beard.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.409
Erm, now,
I believe it was Michael Fassbender,

40:09.410 --> 40:13.169
a former guest here, who suggested
we should contact you to get you on

40:13.170 --> 40:16.689
cos he said you'd love it.
I would love it, yeah. And did you?

40:16.690 --> 40:19.969
I did love it. He's been
your driving partner, hasn't he?

40:19.970 --> 40:23.409
He's been... We would operate...
I don't know what you'd call it,

40:23.410 --> 40:26.649
but you know when you get the
motorbikes with the sidecar racing

40:26.650 --> 40:29.249
and you get the guy on the side
doing the counterbalance?

40:29.250 --> 40:31.531
We would do that for each other,
taking it in turns,

40:31.532 --> 40:37.170
on a golf buggy...
erm, when we made X-Men.

40:37.171 --> 40:39.369
Our golf buggy was,
thankfully, restricted,

40:39.370 --> 40:42.689
but we got into our director's
golf buggy one day, unknowingly,

40:42.690 --> 40:45.451
which had been de-restricted
and I think it went the grand total

40:45.452 --> 40:48.450
of 17 miles an hour
or something like that.

40:48.451 --> 40:52.369
Anyway, I was driving, Michael was
in the back doing counterbalance,

40:52.370 --> 40:54.089
and I'm here, passenger seat here.

40:54.090 --> 40:55.929
There's a seat here, passenger bit,

40:55.930 --> 40:59.049
then another passenger bit there
and then a little footplate here.

40:59.050 --> 41:01.369
He's on the footplate,
hanging on, going like that

41:01.370 --> 41:03.569
when I'm going that way,
all this kind of thing.

41:03.570 --> 41:05.451
He gave me such good
counterbalance,

41:05.452 --> 41:09.130
it just flipped, and when it
sort of landed again

41:09.131 --> 41:12.449
it caught so much traction that we
just launched forward.

41:12.450 --> 41:17.011
Anyway, we launched
into the back of a Lexus.

41:17.034 --> 41:19.072
And, erm...

41:19.073 --> 41:23.352
And I flew forward,
smacked my face off the windscreen

41:23.353 --> 41:25.473
and the next thing I knew
I was about 15 feet

41:25.474 --> 41:29.232
away from the actual golf buggy,
lying on the ground.

41:29.233 --> 41:32.312
I looked up
and Michael had somehow managed,

41:32.313 --> 41:36.391
with a roof and two passenger seats,
then the driver's seat there,

41:36.402 --> 41:37.881
had managed to fly forward

41:37.882 --> 41:41.563
and he was sitting in
the driver's seat, just looking...

41:41.564 --> 41:45.602
And his shins
were like Niagara Falls of blood.

41:45.603 --> 41:47.962
He was just cut to shribbons.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.481
There's something about
a golf buggy which is...

41:50.482 --> 41:53.521
They should never be used for golf,
totally wasted!

41:53.522 --> 41:55.681
Anyway, listen,
if I'm honest with you,

41:55.682 --> 41:58.521
when I heard that you were able to
come on, I was very excited.

41:58.522 --> 42:01.043
I thought,
"He's only been driving 25 minutes,

42:01.044 --> 42:04.042
"there's no way he's going
to be any good."

42:04.043 --> 42:06.962
So are we ready to see
if he was or not?

42:06.963 --> 42:09.003
Yeah! Let's play the lap!

42:13.923 --> 42:16.723
Right, here we go.
Drumchapel, this is for you.

42:18.763 --> 42:22.242
Clear your throat.
The mighty Kia Cee'd.

42:22.243 --> 42:23.923
Did you get the corner right?

42:23.924 --> 42:25.843
Looking good.

42:28.763 --> 42:31.123
A lot of tortured tyres, but we're
through safely.

42:31.124 --> 42:33.762
Dirty little Kia!

42:33.763 --> 42:38.002
It's only cos you had a few offs
in practice that it's dirty.

42:38.003 --> 42:41.203
It's a clean,
legs-together sort of car.

42:43.043 --> 42:46.401
Why do I keep checking my BLEEP
rear-view mirror?

42:46.402 --> 42:49.121
There's nobody there
anyway... except my dust!

42:49.122 --> 42:53.523
You would be amazed how many people
do that - mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

42:59.683 --> 43:01.521
It looks much slower than it felt.

43:01.522 --> 43:04.241
Yeah, no, it's awful, that,
but the slower it looks, sometimes,

43:04.242 --> 43:05.321
the faster you are.

43:05.322 --> 43:06.923
Come on, come on, come on.

43:08.883 --> 43:12.121
Argh, you end up speaking
like a movie, it's ridiculous.

43:12.122 --> 43:14.163
"Come on, come on, come on."
Listen to me.

43:14.164 --> 43:16.282
You've got to talk to them.

43:16.283 --> 43:19.761
They look like machines, but they're
not really. Close to the tyres?

43:19.762 --> 43:21.881
Oh, yes, that was close!
Lewis Hamilton close!

43:21.882 --> 43:25.641
Wobbled the camera. Second-to-last
corner, two bites at the cherry.

43:25.642 --> 43:27.483
Yes, but through and not off,

43:27.484 --> 43:31.202
and that's good
and now we come back to Gambon...

43:31.203 --> 43:33.643
A lot of understeer... Oh, my God!

43:39.763 --> 43:43.601
Which way did you end up facing?
Straight, I went straight on.

43:43.602 --> 43:46.721
The car was completely...
Yeah, but I got it back, though.

43:46.722 --> 43:49.441
You got it back?! Yeah. You must
be a hell of a quick learner

43:49.442 --> 43:51.641
cos for someone who's only
been driving for, well,

43:51.642 --> 43:54.361
not very long, to be able to...
It didn't look too bad at all.

43:54.362 --> 43:56.801
It was great fun. Thank you
so much for letting me have a go.

43:56.802 --> 43:59.563
Oh, man, it was fantastic!
I don't need to know my time!

44:01.883 --> 44:05.362
Right, so where
do you think that you came?

44:05.363 --> 44:07.882
I think I should have got...

44:07.883 --> 44:12.802
about 1.43 probably
and I kept messing up

44:12.803 --> 44:17.081
one of the turns in particular,
so I think I've got about 1.45.

44:17.082 --> 44:19.881
Well, I like your ambition!
Thanks very much.

44:19.882 --> 44:23.201
It is ambitious!
So you're thinking 1.45 somewhere.

44:23.202 --> 44:25.683
Well, you did it,
James McAvoy, in...

44:27.003 --> 44:28.123
one...

44:29.683 --> 44:30.723
forty...

44:33.163 --> 44:34.922
three...

44:34.923 --> 44:37.883
point six! You made your goal! Oh!

44:46.683 --> 44:48.922
Look at that!

44:48.923 --> 44:51.681
Oh! That's brilliant!
I cannot believe that!

44:51.682 --> 44:54.121
Oh, my God, I actually
didn't do too badly!

44:54.122 --> 44:56.721
He's actually breathing
a sigh of relief, cos I don't think

44:56.722 --> 44:59.721
he would have wanted you to go
faster. Fassbender is...

44:59.722 --> 45:01.601
That's a genuinely pleased man!

45:01.602 --> 45:04.763
I'm really, really pleased because
I've had the premonition of me

45:04.764 --> 45:06.522
going round the track

45:06.523 --> 45:10.922
and I've always thought I'd flip
the car, I'd roll it badly

45:10.923 --> 45:12.881
and, erm, so I really did believe

45:12.882 --> 45:15.361
that I'd be down in
the bottom quarter.

45:15.362 --> 45:18.923
Well, you're not. Yes!
Ladies and gentlemen, James McAvoy!

45:27.363 --> 45:32.562
Now, the population of Britain
is getting older

45:32.563 --> 45:35.841
and yet cars seem to be getting
more and more complicated

45:35.842 --> 45:37.923
and fiddly, which is why,
earlier on, Jeremy

45:37.924 --> 45:42.362
and I decided to make a car
specifically for old people.

45:42.363 --> 45:45.043
And now it's time
to test it on the road.

45:52.363 --> 45:55.801
The location for this maiden voyage
was Christchurch,

45:55.802 --> 45:59.201
the south-coast town with
a larger percentage of elderly

45:59.202 --> 46:01.603
residents than anywhere
else in Britain.

46:03.043 --> 46:07.243
It's the perfect place, then,
to test our new car.

46:19.563 --> 46:22.923
Now, listen, I've got
a couple of questions for you.

46:22.924 --> 46:24.762
First of all, this.

46:24.763 --> 46:26.562
Yeah.

46:26.563 --> 46:29.963
Underneath the brake pedal,
I've fitted one of these...

46:29.964 --> 46:34.282
so you know which
pedal you're hitting. Oh, I see!

46:34.283 --> 46:37.363
So there's no chance of
unintended acceleration.

46:37.364 --> 46:40.882
Yeah, that's a big problem solved.

46:40.883 --> 46:43.322
Am I pushing the right pedal?

46:43.323 --> 46:48.522
Yes, I am! There's an audible
reminder! That's brilliant!

46:48.523 --> 46:54.082
Not only that, but the nature
of the noise... Yes, it's funny.

46:54.083 --> 46:56.243
When it comes to cadence braking...

46:56.244 --> 46:58.882
Oh, that is lovely!

46:58.883 --> 47:01.843
Cos a cadence-braking situation
is a panic situation,

47:01.844 --> 47:04.603
but that sprinkles
some comedy into it.

47:06.403 --> 47:08.561
And then the next one I've got,
really, is this.

47:08.562 --> 47:12.563
Well, I've been thorough here
and addressed all the senses, look.

47:12.564 --> 47:15.842
Magnifying glass.
Let's have a look.

47:15.843 --> 47:17.522
Oooh!

47:17.523 --> 47:21.522
'Of course,
the main improvement we'd made

47:21.523 --> 47:25.122
'was the new easy-to-use dashboard.'

47:25.123 --> 47:28.083
Hammond, would you
like to set the sat nav, please?

47:28.084 --> 47:31.922
Yep, we have a choice of
four destinations -

47:31.923 --> 47:35.401
home, post office, Peggy's house or
bingo. Yes, we do. What do you fancy?

47:35.402 --> 47:38.683
A bit of bingo? I fancy a bit
of bingo. A bit of bingo. It's in.

47:38.684 --> 47:40.602
There you go.

47:40.603 --> 47:42.842
You have selected bingo.

47:42.843 --> 47:46.481
If you wouldn't mind turning left,
that would be smashing.

47:46.482 --> 47:49.681
You see, now that's what
I call a sat-nav instruction!

47:49.682 --> 47:51.721
It's so much better than
the German ones.

47:51.722 --> 47:54.721
GO LEFT AT ZE NEXT ROUNDABOUT
OR YOU WILL BE SHOT!

47:54.722 --> 47:57.563
Who wants to be told by a German
where to go? I know!

47:57.564 --> 48:00.202
Or a young German. Well, that!

48:00.203 --> 48:04.603
Continue straight on. This area was
bombed during the war, you know.

48:04.604 --> 48:10.082
Oh, you see! Those are the details
you want. War, rationing...

48:10.083 --> 48:13.602
'Next we tested my new speedometer.'

48:13.603 --> 48:15.723
Taking it up to five!

48:17.603 --> 48:18.883
Seven.

48:20.163 --> 48:21.763
Nine miles an hour!

48:22.763 --> 48:23.883
And into fourth.

48:26.963 --> 48:28.803
Go straight on. Ten!

48:31.003 --> 48:33.083
'But then... disaster.'

48:36.483 --> 48:40.003
It's gone! What? The cat! No!

48:41.923 --> 48:45.682
'The cat had not fared well.'
It's dead!

48:45.683 --> 48:50.002
'Then a young policeman arrived.'
Where was the cat before?

48:50.003 --> 48:54.202
There, but... Is it your cat?
It's dead.

48:54.203 --> 48:57.282
And its name? Tiddles. Dead.

48:57.283 --> 48:59.523
Tiddles? Ex-cat.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.483
After giving the cat
a decent burial...

49:10.523 --> 49:12.163
we reached the bingo hall...

49:13.243 --> 49:15.922
You have arrived! Lovely!

49:15.923 --> 49:19.322
And went off
to find a parking space.

49:19.323 --> 49:23.083
Right, there's one, look,
next to that Focus.

49:25.923 --> 49:28.243
Are you shuffling the wheel? Yes.

49:30.483 --> 49:32.962
These are lovely crashers.

49:32.963 --> 49:38.162
No damage whatsoever to any vehicle
in this car park.

49:38.163 --> 49:40.362
Three and six, 36.

49:40.363 --> 49:45.322
We expected bingo to be
very relaxing. Eight and one, 81.

49:45.323 --> 49:48.282
But it wasn't. Two and one, 21.

49:48.283 --> 49:52.443
I've never concentrated so hard
in my life. Two and eight, 28. Oh!

49:52.444 --> 49:57.002
I'm literally wetting myself!
One and five, 15. It's coming out!

49:57.003 --> 50:00.082
All the sixes, 66. Oh! Say 86!

50:00.083 --> 50:03.322
Six and five, 65. Yes! Oh, boll...!

50:03.323 --> 50:08.042
'Even though we'd lost 17 shillings,
we'd had a great time.'

50:08.043 --> 50:10.522
Exciting! Was it ever?!

50:10.523 --> 50:13.002
'But afterwards there was an issue.'

50:13.003 --> 50:15.483
Now, Jeremy,
can I ask you a question?

50:15.484 --> 50:19.882
Can you remember where we parked
our car? No, Richard, I can't.

50:19.883 --> 50:22.401
This is a common problem,
and not just for the elderly,

50:22.402 --> 50:25.601
which is why, you may have noticed,
on top of our car was a box.

50:25.602 --> 50:28.761
In that box is a special feature
that I can activate

50:28.762 --> 50:31.003
if I press this
button on the key fob.

50:34.163 --> 50:35.402
There it is!

50:35.403 --> 50:38.002
You see, this activates a flare

50:38.003 --> 50:42.163
and we now know to
head in that direction.

50:43.603 --> 50:46.762
Very quickly,
we found the correct car park,

50:46.763 --> 50:49.683
but we still couldn't find the car.

50:53.763 --> 50:56.563
You're the height of
most elderly people.

50:56.564 --> 51:01.202
Can you see our car in this
car park? No. No, I can't.

51:01.203 --> 51:05.243
And that's why,
if I press this button...

51:08.963 --> 51:10.802
You see?

51:10.803 --> 51:14.843
So it's brilliant - the flare
guides us to the rough position

51:14.844 --> 51:19.923
and the balloon takes us
to the precise location of the car.

51:21.243 --> 51:24.562
'Having wound in the balloon
locator system,

51:24.563 --> 51:28.523
'we decided to find out how
our car would go down with some

51:28.524 --> 51:34.162
'actual old people, so we set off to
an old people's home.'

51:34.163 --> 51:37.161
Turn right at the newfangled
mini roundabout.

51:37.162 --> 51:41.523
'And on the way, I showed Hammond
another of my special features.'

51:42.843 --> 51:45.963
Now, the radio, Hammond -
just one station.

51:50.483 --> 51:53.722
It's the music
from the Horse Of The Year Show

51:53.723 --> 51:57.081
and old people love that cos you
can clap along to it. Very nice.

51:57.082 --> 52:00.641
It doesn't tune in to any other
stations? No, that's it.

52:00.642 --> 52:04.041
It plays it on a loop constantly.
Why do you want anything else?

52:04.042 --> 52:07.201
What if you get in your car
after your children have been

52:07.202 --> 52:09.923
driving it and they've left it
tuned to Radio One?!

52:09.924 --> 52:14.762
Or worse still, Radio Two
and that talk-show man who does...

52:14.763 --> 52:15.961
Jeremy Vine. There you go.

52:15.962 --> 52:18.123
Those difficult topics -
they're unsuitable.

52:18.124 --> 52:20.922
What, like pregnancy? Exactly!

52:20.923 --> 52:23.283
'However, there was a problem.'

52:27.763 --> 52:30.681
I can't stop clapping!
I can't stop clapping.

52:30.682 --> 52:34.721
This is a massive design fault!
This isn't safe! Turn it off!

52:34.722 --> 52:38.203
'Eventually, we arrived at
the old people's home...'

52:40.083 --> 52:42.842
Well done, that was lovely.

52:42.843 --> 52:45.962
'..And went to find
the testing team.'

52:45.963 --> 52:51.122
So you're Miriam? I am, yes.
And you're Betty? Yes. I'm Barbara.

52:51.123 --> 52:55.241
You're Barbara. And this is the car
that... What is she called?

52:55.242 --> 52:58.683
This is The James. It's called
The James. James? The James.

52:58.684 --> 53:02.802
A Rover James. Oh, it's a Rover,
yes? First impressions?

53:02.803 --> 53:05.003
What do we think? It's wonderful!

53:05.004 --> 53:07.642
This material is waterproof.

53:07.643 --> 53:12.161
Oh, good! So if there's any little
accidents... Yes! ..don't you worry.

53:12.162 --> 53:16.201
'However, there was an issue with
the Shackleton rear seating.'

53:16.202 --> 53:18.841
Have you got a hoist?
That bit there...

53:18.842 --> 53:20.561
See, in the advert for the chairs,

53:20.562 --> 53:22.881
we were told they were very easy
to get into and out of.

53:22.882 --> 53:26.041
Get me bottom round.
Shall we get a nurse to do this?

53:26.042 --> 53:30.081
No, I'll do it if it kills me!
Well, we'd rather it didn't!

53:30.082 --> 53:33.321
I was going to say... There's
a lot of paperwork. I'm so sorry.

53:33.322 --> 53:35.761
Can I help? We're there!
We're there! Hooray!

53:35.762 --> 53:38.203
Well done!
With both our dignity nearly intact!

53:43.963 --> 53:45.163
Lovely.

53:48.603 --> 53:52.403
'With the testing team on board,
we set off to the bowls club.'

53:52.404 --> 53:55.322
Don't overdo it,
not with your back.

53:55.323 --> 53:59.043
Look at the speed we're going now -
three miles an hour, as you can see.

53:59.044 --> 54:01.563
Oh, isn't this absolute fun?

54:05.083 --> 54:08.442
'Soon, we reached our destination.'

54:08.443 --> 54:12.842
Here we are, ladies,
at the bowling club. Ooh, lovely!

54:12.843 --> 54:16.603
'And Hammond insisted
I show off his new parking sensors.'

54:16.604 --> 54:18.442
Keep going.

54:18.443 --> 54:20.802
Keep going.

54:20.803 --> 54:23.243
You know there's no bumper
on the back?

54:23.244 --> 54:24.842
Just keep backing up.

54:24.843 --> 54:27.043
Ignore the noise,
pretend you can't hear it.

54:29.963 --> 54:32.242
What did he hit?

54:32.243 --> 54:36.242
External rear-mounted airbag!
But... Genius!

54:36.243 --> 54:37.483
Excuse me a minute.

54:37.484 --> 54:42.442
Three quite elderly ladies in there
have now all had heart attacks.

54:42.443 --> 54:46.602
There is that.
Ladies, I do apologise for that.

54:46.603 --> 54:49.683
When have you ever experienced
banging like that? The war.

54:49.684 --> 54:51.362
When the bombs dropped.

54:51.363 --> 54:56.082
You're saying that because
these ladies lived through the war

54:56.083 --> 54:59.883
they're capable of dealing
with a bang of that nature? Yes.

55:01.123 --> 55:05.883
Leaving the ladies to play bowls, we
went off to buy food for a picnic.

55:05.884 --> 55:09.042
What about Battenberg,
or is that too German?

55:09.043 --> 55:11.083
It is too German, isn't it?

55:14.563 --> 55:18.002
Sandwich spread!
Potted meat! Beef spread.

55:18.003 --> 55:20.801
They must have ginger beer
in Christchurch.

55:20.802 --> 55:24.081
Ginger beer's a bit racy,
don't you think? No! They'll love it.

55:24.082 --> 55:27.243
Enid Blyton used to rub herself
with it. There it is.

55:27.244 --> 55:33.362
Peruvian, Greek, Brazilian...
Holland. Dutch. Grown in the UK!

55:33.363 --> 55:35.802
'With the shopping finished,

55:35.803 --> 55:40.402
'it was time to demonstrate
yet another feature of The James.'

55:40.403 --> 55:44.922
If you've got osteoporosis,
arthritis, lumbago... Or rheumatism.

55:44.923 --> 55:47.883
Or rheumatism, then lifting your
heavy shopping into the boot

55:47.884 --> 55:52.162
can be, well,
very difficult indeed.

55:52.163 --> 55:55.001
But with this genius solution,
not a problem.

55:55.002 --> 55:58.803
Bring the trolley up to the back -
that's easy. Lift, drop in, job done.

55:58.804 --> 56:00.643
How brilliant is that?!

56:04.123 --> 56:07.003
'Having picked the ladies up,
we set off for our picnic.'

56:08.883 --> 56:11.362
Where did you get that mouse from?

56:11.363 --> 56:14.443
It's a squeaky ball he's got
underneath the brake.

56:16.243 --> 56:19.401
'Sadly, because it was
an English summer's day,

56:19.402 --> 56:23.563
'it soon started to rain, which
revealed a bit of a design flaw.'

56:23.564 --> 56:29.202
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, no,
no, no! What's happened here?

56:29.203 --> 56:31.483
Ugh, that's a lot of water
coming in now.

56:31.484 --> 56:34.602
This is a disaster that we've had,
Hammond!

56:34.603 --> 56:36.681
I think some of our modifications

56:36.682 --> 56:39.283
have interfered with
the waterproofing.

56:39.284 --> 56:44.002
Is it all on you, dear?
It's all a stream down there.

56:44.003 --> 56:46.841
Look at this spirit of the Blitz
going on. I know.

56:46.842 --> 56:50.681
This is what makes us great.
The Americans would be weeping now.

56:50.682 --> 56:53.521
They'd be making a fuss. But what
good would that do? Nothing!

56:53.522 --> 56:56.603
'And we had just the thing to
raise our spirits even more.'

57:06.043 --> 57:08.281
You can't help it.
You can't, can you?

57:08.282 --> 57:09.883
Oh, no - the constabulary.

57:09.884 --> 57:11.042
Oh, not again!

57:11.043 --> 57:14.203
Sorry, officers!
Nothing to see here!

57:15.243 --> 57:17.321
'Eventually we arrived at exactly

57:17.322 --> 57:20.403
'the sort of picnic spot
elderly people love.'

57:25.523 --> 57:30.482
There we go.
Shall we pop it just here? Yeah.

57:30.483 --> 57:33.283
Look at that for a sunset picnic.

57:39.803 --> 57:43.523
'Having rescued what we could
from the ruined shopping trolley...'

57:43.524 --> 57:47.362
Mr Kipling, bread...
This is all soaked!

57:47.363 --> 57:49.641
'..We settled down to do
what all old people do

57:49.642 --> 57:51.723
'when they're on a picnic together.'

58:15.683 --> 58:18.121
'The next morning
we left Christchurch,

58:18.122 --> 58:21.163
'generally quite pleased with how
things had gone.'

58:21.164 --> 58:24.723
Oh, what?!
Leaking again!

58:25.923 --> 58:29.841
There are a few things we need to
address - there's the waterproofing,

58:29.842 --> 58:33.081
obviously, the Shackleton
easy chairs that aren't,

58:33.082 --> 58:36.083
as it turns out, so easy to get
in and out of, you know.

58:36.084 --> 58:39.562
The irresistible clapping machine.
Yeah. Er...

58:39.563 --> 58:42.961
Hold on, if we carry on along here,
we'll have to get on the motorway.

58:42.962 --> 58:45.203
Yes, I know, and that will give us

58:45.204 --> 58:52.042
the opportunity to test a feature
that I fitted. What?

58:52.043 --> 58:55.361
Well, you know you're always reading
in the newspapers about

58:55.362 --> 58:59.001
an old person who's driven 30 miles
the wrong way down the M1? Yeah.

58:59.002 --> 59:02.801
Well, I've fitted something that
will stop that happening. How?

59:02.802 --> 59:05.563
Well, no, look, you see here
it's not clearly marked,

59:05.564 --> 59:09.602
it's easy to go the wrong way down
that slip road.

59:09.603 --> 59:12.242
I just did. Exactly!

59:12.243 --> 59:13.963
Watch this - here we go.

59:17.123 --> 59:20.242
Oh, I see! That's clever,
that's good.

59:20.243 --> 59:23.483
But if I miss the signs,
I could just as easily miss all this.

59:23.484 --> 59:26.882
Yeah, OK, keep going. Oh,
this is going to be...

59:26.883 --> 59:28.923
Keep going!

59:38.323 --> 59:41.042
There you go! You idiot!

59:41.043 --> 59:43.922
What?! Well, it's ruined!

59:43.923 --> 59:46.921
Yes, but it can't go on the motorway
going the wrong way.

59:46.922 --> 59:50.641
No, we can't GO anywhere
because you've exploded the car!

59:50.642 --> 59:53.883
We're alive,
everybody on that motorway is alive,

59:53.884 --> 59:56.722
this is the best solution ever.

59:56.723 --> 59:58.923
I've wet myself again!

01:00:01.563 --> 01:00:04.682
Thank you, ladies! What?!

01:00:04.683 --> 01:00:07.963
I knew you'd have something
to say about it. What?

01:00:07.964 --> 01:00:11.682
I think you've overdone it.
What on this is overdone?

01:00:11.683 --> 01:00:13.801
That heater -
that's too complicated.

01:00:13.802 --> 01:00:16.521
I said that - you don't need a button
for hot and a button for cold,

01:00:16.522 --> 01:00:18.881
you just need one that says,
"Just right."

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:22.561
No, no, let's not get bogged down
with details cos I think it's more

01:00:22.562 --> 01:00:24.761
important we express our
appreciation

01:00:24.762 --> 01:00:26.241
for the man who provided us

01:00:26.242 --> 01:00:29.563
with the voice for our satellite
navigation system because it was

01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:35.882
the lovely Richard Briers, who sadly
died just last week, so thank you.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:38.363
Honour to have met him.
It was. Honour to have met him.

01:00:41.003 --> 01:00:45.762
Anyway, next week...
it is our Christmas special!

01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:48.203
It's hardly Christmas, is it?
Not really.

01:00:48.204 --> 01:00:53.082
It is if you're watching
this on Dave in 2016. Good point!

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:57.441
Anyway, it's us in three very cheap
estate cars, plunging around

01:00:57.442 --> 01:01:01.801
in the heart of Africa looking
for the source of the River Nile.

01:01:01.802 --> 01:01:04.881
Now, it is in two parts.
This is quite simple.

01:01:04.882 --> 01:01:08.641
Part one is on next Sunday,
part two, the week after that.

01:01:08.642 --> 01:01:10.881
Yep, and they are both worth a watch

01:01:10.882 --> 01:01:14.881
because we do quite literally
rewrite history. We do indeed.

01:01:14.882 --> 01:01:18.161
And, on that bombshell, time to end.
Thanks for watching.

01:01:18.162 --> 01:01:19.483
See you next week. Good night!
