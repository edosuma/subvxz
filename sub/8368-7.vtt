WEBVTT

00:00.111 --> 00:02.178
This was very,
very successful for you.

00:02.213 --> 00:05.081
There's almost no payoff.

00:05.115 --> 00:06.516
For me, this is a win-win.

00:08.319 --> 00:10.053
<i>McKenzie: Previously on
Face Off...</i>

00:10.087 --> 00:12.922
<i>Yvonne's whimsical ghost
brought her her second win,</i>

00:12.957 --> 00:15.725
<i>but Johnny missed his mark
and was sent home,</i>

00:15.759 --> 00:18.461
<i>and tonight, the artists
are put to the ultimate test.</i>

00:18.495 --> 00:21.865
Brace yourselves for...
the Gauntlet.

00:21.899 --> 00:23.032
Oh.

00:23.067 --> 00:25.501
I'd lose my shit.

00:25.536 --> 00:27.003
Damn it!

00:27.037 --> 00:29.472
- What is happening?
- We have no idea what's coming.

00:29.506 --> 00:30.607
You are a strange man.

00:30.641 --> 00:31.941
Thank you.

00:31.976 --> 00:33.276
Take a look.

00:34.278 --> 00:35.979
I might have a panic attack.

00:36.981 --> 00:38.414
<i>McKenzie: In the end, only one</i>

00:38.449 --> 00:41.017

Kryolan Professional Make-Up</i>

00:41.051 --> 00:43.586

Sync and corrections by n17t01

01:41.578 --> 01:42.612
All right.

01:42.646 --> 01:43.880
- What?
- What the hell?

01:43.914 --> 01:45.682
- It's very watery.
- <i>We walk into the lab,</i>

01:45.716 --> 01:49.385
<i>and McKenzie is standing next
to these four monitors,</i>

01:49.420 --> 01:53.156
and there's this watery light
show going on behind her,

01:53.190 --> 01:55.091
<i>and we have no idea
what's going on.</i>

01:55.125 --> 01:57.894
I hope to God
it's not underwater makeup.

01:57.928 --> 02:00.730
Congratulations on making
it this far in the competition.

02:00.764 --> 02:02.365
- Thank you.
- Now, I'm sure it's been

02:02.399 --> 02:05.134
quite a wild ride
for you so far,

02:05.169 --> 02:06.302
but you might want

02:06.337 --> 02:08.471
to strap yourselves in
because your mettle

02:08.505 --> 02:12.508
as makeup artists is about to be
put to the ultimate test.

02:14.111 --> 02:18.448
Brace yourselves for...
the Gauntlet.

02:18.482 --> 02:19.449
- Oh.
- Shit.

02:19.483 --> 02:21.818
Oh, man.

02:21.852 --> 02:24.921
As soon as McKenzie says
"Gauntlet," I lose my shit.

02:24.955 --> 02:26.356
I'm terrified.

02:26.390 --> 02:29.525
As a reminder, the Gauntlet
is a series of three challenges

02:29.560 --> 02:32.161
designed to test every facet
of your skills

02:32.196 --> 02:34.364
- as a makeup artist.
- Oh, my God.

02:34.398 --> 02:37.967
In the end,
one of you will be eliminated.

02:38.002 --> 02:39.435
- Oh, God.
- However,

02:39.470 --> 02:43.106
this season we're gonna
do things a little differently.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.674
In stages one and two,

02:44.708 --> 02:47.076
the two artists
who secure top looks

02:47.111 --> 02:50.179
will be safe this week
and will not be required

02:50.214 --> 02:52.515
to compete
in the subsequent rounds.

02:52.549 --> 02:53.816
I'm gonna throw up.

02:53.851 --> 02:55.518
<i>I hope I win
that so I can just chill out</i>

02:55.552 --> 02:59.255
and watch the others
fight themselves to death.

02:59.289 --> 03:02.091
All right, let the games begin.

03:02.126 --> 03:04.827
In films like Hook and
Pirates of the Caribbean,

03:04.862 --> 03:07.230
pirate captains
take center stage

03:07.264 --> 03:10.199
as swarthy and savvy kings
of the sea,

03:10.234 --> 03:13.036
so for your first Gauntlet
challenge,

03:13.070 --> 03:15.371
you'll be creating
your own captain

03:15.406 --> 03:17.006
character inspired

03:17.041 --> 03:20.243
by some of history's most famous
mythical ships.

03:20.277 --> 03:21.711
Oh, yes, I'm excited.

03:21.745 --> 03:25.081
But there's another major
component of this challenge.

03:25.115 --> 03:27.050
- Of course.
- What's one of the things

03:27.084 --> 03:30.253
that many of history's
famous captains have in common?

03:30.287 --> 03:31.654
A signature beard,

03:31.688 --> 03:35.091
so in addition to simply making
a captain character,

03:35.125 --> 03:38.995
you must also hand lay
a magnificent beard.

03:39.029 --> 03:40.463
<i>I really like laying beards,</i>

03:40.497 --> 03:42.065
so I'm like,
"Here's my chance to shine."

03:43.867 --> 03:45.068
<i>This will be the first time</i>

03:45.102 --> 03:46.969
that I've ever had
to hand lay a beard,

03:47.004 --> 03:49.072
so I'm feeling really nervous.

03:49.106 --> 03:50.706
All right, well, you guys
ready to see what ships you

03:50.741 --> 03:52.442
- have to inspire your captains?
- Yes.

03:52.476 --> 03:53.509
Yes.

03:53.544 --> 03:55.578
First we have the Manjet barge,

03:55.612 --> 03:58.281
the ship that carried
the Egyptian sun god Ra

03:58.315 --> 03:59.849
<i>across the sky.</i>

03:59.883 --> 04:01.417
Next we have the Naglfar,

04:01.452 --> 04:05.021
<i>a Viking ship composed of the
bones and nails of the dead.</i>

04:05.055 --> 04:06.222
- Ooh.
- Yes, please.

04:06.256 --> 04:07.990
Our third ship
is the Flying Dutchman,

04:08.025 --> 04:11.260
<i>crewed by the souls
of dead pirates,</i>

04:11.295 --> 04:13.463
and finally, the Nautilus,

04:13.497 --> 04:15.832
<i>Jules Verne's fictional
steam-powered submarine</i>

04:15.866 --> 04:18.101
from 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea.

04:18.135 --> 04:20.136
I'm so excited.
I'm so excited.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.870
Guys, come on out.

04:21.904 --> 04:24.907
[laughter]

04:32.683 --> 04:34.383
I'm, like, excited
and terrified.

04:34.418 --> 04:37.353
So as you can see,
the captains are all geared up,

04:37.387 --> 04:39.922
and it's up to you to complete
their looks in a manner

04:39.957 --> 04:41.891
appropriate to their ships.

04:41.925 --> 04:44.393
You have two hours
for this challenge.

04:44.428 --> 04:47.930
On my go, pick a model
and get started.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.466
Go!

04:53.604 --> 04:54.770
- Damn it!
- I touched you,

04:54.805 --> 04:57.006
so now you're mine.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.574
Ready to have a big-ass beard?

04:58.609 --> 04:59.876
<i>I see the Flying Dutchman,</i>

04:59.910 --> 05:01.344
and I'm like,
"That's the one I got to have".

05:01.378 --> 05:03.746
<i>It's ruled by the souls
of the damned,</i>

05:03.780 --> 05:08.151
<i>so I need to make this captain
match this amazing pirate ship.</i>

05:08.185 --> 05:09.752
<i>I need him to look dead,</i>

05:09.786 --> 05:12.121
so I quickly base him out
in a grayish color,

05:13.290 --> 05:14.590
and then I start laying
the beard.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.092
<i>He's out on the open water,</i>

05:16.126 --> 05:17.627
<i>so I'm pretty sure
he doesn't have mirrors.</i>

05:17.661 --> 05:18.761
<i>He can't really take care of it,</i>

05:18.795 --> 05:20.596
<i>so I want it
to look more scraggly,</i>

05:20.631 --> 05:23.266
and I'm thinking
this might be kind of cool.

05:28.739 --> 05:30.072
This is terrifying.

05:30.107 --> 05:31.641
<i>I get the Nautilus ship,</i>

05:31.675 --> 05:35.044
and it has sort
of a steam punk feel.

05:35.078 --> 05:37.680
My captain
is gonna be an old sailor,

05:37.714 --> 05:39.549
but I want him to look surreal,

05:39.583 --> 05:42.318
<i>so I'm trying to incorporate
some of this color palette</i>

05:42.352 --> 05:44.320
<i>and some of these shapes
into my character,</i>

05:44.354 --> 05:47.423
but the crux of the challenge
is laying a beard,

05:47.457 --> 05:50.426
and I am not good with hair
at all.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.727
Gross.

05:51.762 --> 05:53.162
I don't like
when it sticks to my fingers.

05:53.197 --> 05:54.897
I don't like having it
on my own head,

05:54.932 --> 05:58.334
so I'm feeling like I'm going
to stage two of the Gauntlet.

05:58.368 --> 06:00.903
My scissor is sticky. Fuck!

06:04.141 --> 06:08.744
I'm doing a clean,
luxurious, well-kept captain.

06:08.779 --> 06:11.514
<i>The Nautilus costume is
actually really cool-looking.</i>

06:11.548 --> 06:14.550
<i>There's a lot of coppers
and golds and, like, reds,</i>

06:14.585 --> 06:18.054
so I decide to use some hair
that has red tones in it.

06:20.857 --> 06:22.592
I'm just gonna spray
on some gold highlights.

06:22.626 --> 06:24.093
<i>I get the Manjet barge.</i>

06:24.127 --> 06:26.295
<i>It's an Egyptian gold boat,</i>

06:26.330 --> 06:28.864
<i>so I decided to go
with this holy god look</i>

06:28.899 --> 06:31.033
that would inspire
future pharaohs.

06:31.068 --> 06:33.502
<i>I do a lot of costuming
for myself,</i>

06:33.537 --> 06:36.239
<i>and I usually dress up as guys,
so I wear a lot of facial hair.</i>

06:36.273 --> 06:38.874
<i>I've been laying beards
for about seven years now,</i>

06:38.909 --> 06:41.110
<i>so the technique
that I use for laying hair</i>

06:41.144 --> 06:42.678
<i>is I hold a small section
of hair.</i>

06:42.713 --> 06:44.313
<i>I dab part of it in Pros-Aide,</i>

06:44.348 --> 06:46.482
tap it down,
and then pull out the excess

06:46.516 --> 06:48.251
<i>so it
looks a little bit more sparse</i>

06:48.285 --> 06:49.552
<i>like a natural beard would look.</i>

06:49.586 --> 06:50.953
<i>While I'm very excited
for this challenge,</i>

06:50.988 --> 06:53.289
if I fail it,
it's also gonna be humiliating.

06:53.323 --> 06:55.157
[laughs]

06:55.192 --> 06:56.492
<i>Hopefully they like it.</i>

07:03.767 --> 07:05.134
<i>I picked the Flying Dutchman,</i>

07:05.168 --> 07:07.103
which is a ghost ship,

07:07.137 --> 07:11.040
<i>so the captain
would have to look ghost-like.</i>

07:11.074 --> 07:13.542
Captain Geschirrspuelmaschine.

07:13.577 --> 07:17.280
"Geschirrspuelmaschine"
means dishwasher in German,

07:17.314 --> 07:21.550
so my concept is the captain
was cursed by his ex-wife

07:21.585 --> 07:23.786
<i>because he never
washed the dishes.</i>

07:23.820 --> 07:26.689
<i>To turn you into a dirty pirate</i>

07:26.723 --> 07:27.890
it's Captain Dishwasher.

07:32.763 --> 07:36.565
<i>I get the Naglfar because it
looks like an old Viking ship,</i>

07:36.600 --> 07:39.068
<i>and I love the whole genre
of Vikings,</i>

07:39.102 --> 07:42.605
so my concept is a captain
of a warship,

07:42.639 --> 07:44.774
<i>so I want to go with
warrior paint, a simple beard,</i>

07:44.808 --> 07:46.475
maybe one braid in the chin,

07:46.510 --> 07:48.778
and a little bit
aged and weathered.

07:48.812 --> 07:50.613
<i>I'm trying to make the beard</i>

07:50.647 --> 07:53.649
thicker and heavier down towards
the neckline and the jaw line

07:53.684 --> 07:55.785
<i>so it kind of just has
a little more realistic look.</i>

07:57.020 --> 07:58.587
- Five minutes, guys.
- Thank you.

08:06.697 --> 08:09.398
Time's up, brushes down.

08:09.433 --> 08:12.134
Now, who better to weigh
in on your work

08:12.169 --> 08:18.140
than our very own series judges,
Glenn Hetrick, Ve Neill,

08:18.175 --> 08:19.608
- Hi, everyone.
- And Neville Page.

08:19.643 --> 08:20.810
<i>It's very nerve-racking</i>

08:20.844 --> 08:22.945
<i>to have the judges
here at the lab.</i>

08:22.979 --> 08:25.481
It really brings up
the pressure.

08:25.515 --> 08:27.983
My character is the captain
of the Naglfar,

08:28.018 --> 08:31.153
<i>a Viking ship
made of bone and nails.</i>

08:31.188 --> 08:32.455
- You did a pretty good job.
- Thank you.

08:32.489 --> 08:33.889
You even got the mustache on.

08:33.924 --> 08:35.991
I particularly
like how you trimmed it 'cause

08:36.025 --> 08:38.961
it feels lived-in,
coarse and bristly.

08:38.995 --> 08:40.395
Thank you.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.664
I really want to win
because I do not want

08:42.698 --> 08:45.000
to deal with the stress
that the Gauntlet will bring.

08:46.636 --> 08:50.339
My character is the embodiment
of the sun king Ra.

08:50.374 --> 08:54.577
This is really courageous
because it's so little beard.

08:54.611 --> 08:58.381
I wanted to stay true to the
representation of the pharaohs.

08:58.415 --> 08:59.749
Yeah,
I think that's really smart.

08:59.783 --> 09:01.784
It doesn't feel like you
were skirting the issue here

09:01.818 --> 09:04.053
and trying to get away
with laying very little hair.

09:04.087 --> 09:06.055
It feels very appropriate
for what it is.

09:06.089 --> 09:07.590
- Thank you.
- This is

09:07.624 --> 09:11.394
Captain Geschirrspuelmaschine,
which is German for dishwasher.

09:11.428 --> 09:12.661
<i>His wife put a curse</i>

09:12.696 --> 09:15.231
on him because he
was never washing the dishes.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.600
You are a strange, strange man.

09:17.634 --> 09:18.834
- Thank you.
- And I like it.

09:18.869 --> 09:20.302
I like all of the thought

09:20.337 --> 09:22.638
that you put
into this character, very cool.

09:22.672 --> 09:23.906
Oh, and the scar action.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.075
The mustache is really nice.
It's subtle,

09:26.109 --> 09:28.077
and I think that was a smart way
to approach this.

09:28.111 --> 09:29.145
Thank you.

09:29.179 --> 09:31.380
This is my Viking captain.

09:31.415 --> 09:33.382
You did a pretty good job
laying your beard in.

09:33.417 --> 09:34.617
Thank you.

09:34.651 --> 09:36.118
I like the fact
that you blended colors too.

09:36.153 --> 09:37.486
That's always important.

09:37.521 --> 09:39.255
And also the color
that you've applied to his face,

09:39.289 --> 09:41.624
the way you've dirtied him up,
it really helps

09:41.658 --> 09:44.593
to pull everything together
so the colors in the hair

09:44.628 --> 09:46.729
and the colors on his face
work nicely together.

09:46.763 --> 09:48.197
- This could go on screen, and...
- Thank you.

09:48.231 --> 09:50.099
You wouldn't notice
that it was laid on.

09:50.133 --> 09:51.534
- Thank you.
- He's basically

09:51.568 --> 09:53.903
an Egyptian pirate
that's been sailing the seas

09:53.937 --> 09:55.371
<i>in the blazing sun.</i>

09:55.405 --> 09:57.640
That's pretty nice. You got
the edge really broken up,

09:57.674 --> 09:59.275
very natural and real-looking.

09:59.309 --> 10:02.545
I wish that your braiding
here was just a little better.

10:02.579 --> 10:03.979
Better? Yeah,
no, I totally agree.

10:04.014 --> 10:05.281
Yeah, it's a great idea though.

10:05.315 --> 10:06.615
- That was last-minute.
- Yeah, but it...

10:06.650 --> 10:08.184
I mean, it sells the idea.

10:08.218 --> 10:11.086
<i>I would love to be able to
sit out for the next challenge,</i>

10:11.121 --> 10:12.655
<i>and we have no idea
what's coming,</i>

10:12.689 --> 10:14.824
<i>so I'm super nervous right now.</i>

10:17.661 --> 10:20.763
So, Glenn, who were the top
looks from stage one?

10:20.797 --> 10:22.498
The top
looks from stage one are...

10:22.532 --> 10:23.799
<i>My heart starts racing.</i>

10:23.834 --> 10:25.935
If Glenn doesn't call my name,

10:25.969 --> 10:27.970
I might have a panic attack.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.972
<i>I definitely want to be
one of the top looks.</i>

10:30.006 --> 10:31.607
I don't want to have
to fight to the death

10:31.641 --> 10:32.975
<i>in the second stage
of the Gauntlet.</i>

10:33.009 --> 10:34.310
<i>This is terrifying.</i>

10:37.055 --> 10:39.323
Who were the top looks
from stage one?

10:42.727 --> 10:46.897
Walter, your character
had a really clean beard,

10:46.931 --> 10:49.500
and the decision to do
some breakup and weathering

10:49.534 --> 10:51.201
on the face was brilliant.

10:51.236 --> 10:52.202
Thank you very much.

10:52.237 --> 10:53.771
I am done with the Gauntlet.

10:53.805 --> 10:56.807
That's huge because I'm safe
from the next two stages.

10:56.841 --> 10:59.777
And Melissa, you
made some really great decisions

10:59.811 --> 11:01.445
that resulted
in a beautiful character

11:01.479 --> 11:03.247
- that really told your story.
- Thank you.

11:03.281 --> 11:04.882
I'm safe, whew.

11:04.916 --> 11:07.117
That's good.

11:07.152 --> 11:10.254
I can sit back and relax,
do my laundry.

11:10.288 --> 11:12.623
Walter and Melissa,
congratulations.

11:12.657 --> 11:15.325
Now I have a little surprise
for you two.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.761
As our top looks from stage one,

11:17.796 --> 11:21.365
you're both going to enjoy
a night on the town.

11:21.399 --> 11:24.101
- No way.
- Yes, yes way.

11:24.135 --> 11:27.337
A limo will pick you up later
along with the top looks

11:27.372 --> 11:29.907
- from the Gauntlet stage two.
- Ooh.

11:29.941 --> 11:31.608
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

11:31.643 --> 11:32.843
We get to go out.

11:34.546 --> 11:36.580
All right, you two,
you can go ahead and head home

11:36.614 --> 11:38.415
to get ready for your night
out on the town.

11:38.450 --> 11:39.450
- Thank you.
- Bye.

11:39.484 --> 11:42.419
- Thank you very much.
- Have fun.

11:45.490 --> 11:49.359
Your next challenge taps
into a legendary object that,

11:49.394 --> 11:54.364
if opened, will unleash chaos
upon the world...

11:54.399 --> 11:55.933
Pandora's Box.

11:57.268 --> 11:59.770
- Ooh.
- What is happening?

11:59.804 --> 12:03.707
So in the spirit of Pandora's
Box and the chaos within,

12:03.742 --> 12:07.644
your next challenge is all about
creating order from chaos.

12:10.148 --> 12:12.049
<i>I'm thinking this could be
right up my alley.</i>

12:12.083 --> 12:13.617
I'm definitely excited.

12:14.719 --> 12:16.186
This is cool.

12:16.221 --> 12:17.755
Inside each of the boxes

12:17.789 --> 12:21.125
around you
are three premade prosthetics.

12:21.159 --> 12:24.828
Your stage two challenge is to
use those three disparate pieces

12:24.863 --> 12:26.764
to create a cohesive character.

12:27.799 --> 12:29.433
Not too bad, right?

12:29.467 --> 12:30.734
Of course, there's a catch.

12:30.769 --> 12:32.302
When is there not?

12:32.337 --> 12:35.272
Chaos is unpredictable,
and so is this challenge.

12:35.306 --> 12:38.976
You may not use any
of your prosthetics in the way

12:39.010 --> 12:40.444
that they were intended.

12:41.479 --> 12:43.247
For instance,
if you get a chin piece,

12:43.281 --> 12:45.716
you cannot use it on the chin.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.184
<i>I'm feeling so overwhelmed.</i>

12:47.218 --> 12:49.319
This feels so much harder
than the beard challenge.

12:49.354 --> 12:50.854
- They weren't kidding.
- All right, judges,

12:50.889 --> 12:53.357
any words of wisdom
before things get underway?

12:53.391 --> 12:55.659
If you take the chin
and put it on the forehead,

12:55.693 --> 12:57.594
it can't be a chin forehead.

12:57.629 --> 13:01.598
Just understand the utility
of the piece.

13:01.633 --> 13:05.302
All right, guys, when I say
go, select a model and a box

13:05.336 --> 13:07.204
and get started.

13:07.238 --> 13:08.539
Go!

13:11.509 --> 13:14.111
- Hello.
- Oh, wonderful.

13:14.145 --> 13:17.714
There's a brow piece,
a nose piece, and a neck piece.

13:17.749 --> 13:20.484
What I'm instantly drawn
to is witch.

13:20.518 --> 13:22.119
<i>I can lay down the nose
on her chin</i>

13:22.153 --> 13:23.187
<i>just to point it out.</i>

13:23.221 --> 13:25.656
The next thing
I do is start lining up

13:25.690 --> 13:27.491
the brow piece on her jaw line,

13:27.525 --> 13:29.493
<i>and then I take the double
chin, I cut it in half,</i>

13:29.527 --> 13:30.894
and I make these ears.

13:30.929 --> 13:32.663
<i>It's looking better
than what I expected.</i>

13:36.968 --> 13:37.935
This is the fun one.

13:37.969 --> 13:40.671
I have a forehead piece, a nose,

13:40.705 --> 13:42.639
and two cheek pieces,

13:42.674 --> 13:46.109
<i>so I think of a ghostly
undertaker-type character.</i>

13:46.144 --> 13:50.581
I decided to use the cheek
pieces as forehead anatomy.

13:50.615 --> 13:53.116
<i>I put the nose upside down
on the chin,</i>

13:53.151 --> 13:55.586
and the eyebrow piece
is very angular,

13:55.620 --> 13:57.521
and there's a lot
of definite shapes in it,

13:57.555 --> 14:01.625
so I cut it in half
and used them as jawbone pieces.

14:06.731 --> 14:08.265
<i>I have a brow and nose piece,</i>

14:08.299 --> 14:10.834
<i>two under-eye
cheek prosthetics,</i>

14:10.869 --> 14:12.336
<i>and a butt chin,</i>

14:12.370 --> 14:14.538
so I'm thinking more alien
right off the bat.

14:16.741 --> 14:19.376
<i>I take the two cheeks
and put them near the ears,</i>

14:19.410 --> 14:22.613
and I'm feeling confident
about the placement of them,

14:22.647 --> 14:24.581
<i>but I have the chin piece left,</i>

14:24.616 --> 14:28.151
which is the only piece I can't
seem to find a place to put.

14:28.186 --> 14:29.786
I got to do something
with this shit.

14:29.821 --> 14:31.221
I'm trying it as horns.

14:31.256 --> 14:32.789
<i>I'm trying it behind the ears.</i>

14:32.824 --> 14:34.157
Can you hold this here?

14:34.192 --> 14:36.693
Finally I put it under here
like a frog sort of feel.

14:36.728 --> 14:37.895
<i>It's not the best idea,</i>

14:37.929 --> 14:40.264
but it's better to have
a bad idea than no idea.

14:46.304 --> 14:50.107
I'm kind of going for, like,
a Robin Hood-type character

14:50.141 --> 14:52.776
that's a protector
of the animals.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.746
<i>This stage is so much harder
than stage one.</i>

14:55.780 --> 14:59.016
<i>I end up getting
this weird owl prosthetic</i>

14:59.050 --> 15:01.184
<i>which I apply around the jaw.</i>

15:01.219 --> 15:04.354
I also have two nasal
labial folds,

15:04.389 --> 15:07.491
<i>and I place the pieces
around the eyes.</i>

15:07.525 --> 15:09.793
Finally, I have a werewolf nose.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.862
<i>I place it underneath the lip,</i>

15:11.896 --> 15:14.398
and that's my favorite part
of the makeup so far.

15:23.408 --> 15:25.409
So let's do this right.

15:25.443 --> 15:26.710
<i>I have the big chin.</i>

15:26.744 --> 15:30.080
The forehead is connected
with the low piece,

15:30.114 --> 15:32.349
<i>and I have two giant Spock ears.</i>

15:32.383 --> 15:36.320
<i>The nose piece is turned
upside-down on the cheeks.</i>

15:36.354 --> 15:39.156
<i>I put the Mr. Spock ears
over her eyebrows.</i>

15:39.190 --> 15:41.591
Works pretty well,
and then the big chin,

15:41.626 --> 15:43.860
I just pop it on the forehead.

15:43.895 --> 15:46.563
<i>Immediately, a name
pops to my mind,</i>

15:46.597 --> 15:48.498
and it's Kwaldangna.

15:49.534 --> 15:51.234
<i>She's a demonic presence.</i>

15:51.269 --> 15:54.237
I will use her to put a spell
on the judges

15:54.272 --> 15:55.605
<i>to work in my favor.</i>

16:00.445 --> 16:02.045
15 minutes left.

16:09.687 --> 16:13.190
That's it, guys.
Time is up, brushes down.

16:13.224 --> 16:14.291
Yeah.

16:14.325 --> 16:16.927
This is Chessa,
a cat-elf hybrid.

16:16.961 --> 16:19.396
The ears are a neck piece.

16:19.430 --> 16:21.465
Her chin right here
is a nose piece,

16:21.499 --> 16:23.700
and her cheeks are brow.

16:23.735 --> 16:26.937
It actually works in kind
of that Froud fairy

16:26.971 --> 16:28.405
petal aesthetic.

16:28.439 --> 16:30.374
You maybe should have popped
her eyebrows a little bit more

16:30.408 --> 16:33.110
since you have so much color
on her eyelids.

16:33.144 --> 16:36.513
My character is sort
of a roguish alien smuggler.

16:36.547 --> 16:37.781
<i>The pieces on his forehead</i>

16:37.815 --> 16:41.084
were two cheek pieces kind
of like a clown grin.

16:41.119 --> 16:42.953
His chin is a nose piece,

16:42.987 --> 16:45.589
and his jaw pieces were
a forehead that I split in half.

16:45.623 --> 16:48.025
It's smart placement,
particularly that forehead.

16:48.059 --> 16:49.292
- That's great.
- Thank you.

16:49.327 --> 16:50.961
I do like your color
choices too.

16:50.995 --> 16:53.463
I like that purple-y color
and that spatter work

16:53.498 --> 16:55.899
and everything,
breaks it up nicely.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.201
Okay, this is Kwaldangna.

16:58.236 --> 17:01.071
I summoned her
from the Stahl system

17:01.105 --> 17:04.241
to enchant your brains
to make me win from now on.

17:04.275 --> 17:05.909
Oh.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.243
So this is ears.

17:07.278 --> 17:08.878
This is the chin piece.

17:08.913 --> 17:10.914
This is the forehead,

17:10.948 --> 17:13.282
and this is actually the nose.

17:13.317 --> 17:15.519
It strangely fit
all very well together.

17:15.553 --> 17:17.587
- It did, didn't it?
- Yeah, it sure did,

17:17.622 --> 17:19.321
and it ended up
with almost something

17:19.357 --> 17:23.193
that feels like Kabuki with
Spanish ren faire costuming.

17:23.227 --> 17:24.560
It really works for me.

17:24.595 --> 17:26.997
I love the paint job too.
She's very colorful.

17:27.031 --> 17:30.367
I'm already thinking of what
to order at that restaurant.

17:30.401 --> 17:34.337
What I had was a nose piece
that I used for her chin,

17:34.372 --> 17:37.541
a lower lip piece
that I used for her brow.

17:37.575 --> 17:39.476
The upper lip I put on her neck.

17:39.510 --> 17:40.644
I wanted to start making, like,

17:40.678 --> 17:43.280
a wrinkle,
and then, of course, the jaw,

17:43.314 --> 17:46.149
I couldn't really do much
with it, so I decided, you know,

17:46.184 --> 17:47.784
headdress trophy.

17:47.819 --> 17:48.785
I like where the jaw is,

17:48.820 --> 17:49.953
- actually.
- Yeah.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.021
I think it frames
her eyes nicely and...

17:51.055 --> 17:52.022
It's kind
of a crown there anyway.

17:52.056 --> 17:53.090
Yeah, it looks really cool

17:53.124 --> 17:54.491
like that with the teeth
inverted,

17:54.525 --> 17:58.495
and I really like what you did
with this neck idea.

17:58.529 --> 18:00.330
I'm not so sure
I agree with you,

18:00.364 --> 18:01.665
Glenn, on this piece.

18:01.699 --> 18:03.333
It feels like that's
a desperate attempt of,

18:03.367 --> 18:05.635
"I got to give the other piece
somewhere.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.504
Where does it go?"

18:07.538 --> 18:09.639
This is actually a chin piece

18:09.674 --> 18:11.308
that I cut in half.

18:11.342 --> 18:13.510
<i>I figured this was an external
breathing mechanism.</i>

18:13.544 --> 18:14.911
- Mm-hmm.
- This is a nose,

18:14.946 --> 18:16.780
which was attached
to a brow piece.

18:16.814 --> 18:19.516
The brow piece is connected
to an under-eye bag.

18:19.550 --> 18:21.551
I don't know that I love
what you did with the chubby

18:21.586 --> 18:22.719
cheek appliances.

18:22.753 --> 18:23.854
It almost looks like he has

18:23.888 --> 18:25.889
something stuck
into the side of his throat.

18:25.923 --> 18:28.391
I do like this rusty kind of
thing going on up here though.

18:28.426 --> 18:29.960
- That's a cool idea.
- Thank you.

18:29.994 --> 18:31.595
<i>After hearing from the judges,</i>

18:31.629 --> 18:34.898
I'm not feeling confident
about being a top look.

18:36.868 --> 18:38.201
Okay, guys,

18:38.236 --> 18:41.238
it's time to find out
who came out on top. Glenn?

18:41.272 --> 18:46.076
The top looks from stage two
of the Gauntlet are...

18:46.110 --> 18:48.211
Rob.

18:48.246 --> 18:50.013
The way
that you repurposed the shapes

18:50.047 --> 18:53.316
and really made them fit created
such a complete character,

18:53.351 --> 18:55.919
it felt like it could be
a background alien in a film.

18:55.953 --> 18:57.154
Thank you very much.

18:57.188 --> 18:58.788
It's so exciting. I'm out.

18:58.823 --> 19:00.290
<i>I don't have to do stage three.</i>

19:00.324 --> 19:01.625
It's the best feeling.

19:03.895 --> 19:08.365
The second top look is...

19:08.399 --> 19:09.733
Robert.

19:09.767 --> 19:12.202
Choosing to use the ears
above the brow bone,

19:12.236 --> 19:14.971
giving her this demonic look
that almost felt Kabuki,

19:15.006 --> 19:16.239
so cool.

19:16.274 --> 19:17.707
Yes!

19:17.742 --> 19:19.843
<i>I'm relieved that I'm done
with the Gauntlet.</i>

19:19.877 --> 19:22.579
It looked like the magic spell
worked out in the end.

19:22.613 --> 19:24.247
Rob and Robert, congratulations.

19:24.282 --> 19:26.449
Why don't you go ahead and take
off so that you can get ready?

19:26.484 --> 19:27.450
- Have fun tonight.
- Bye.

19:27.485 --> 19:29.586
- Good night, guys.
- Enjoy.

19:32.356 --> 19:35.125
And to the rest of you,
I will see you tomorrow morning

19:35.159 --> 19:38.228
for the third and final stage
of the Gauntlet.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.330
For now, I want you to go
get some rest 'cause

19:40.364 --> 19:43.066
you're gonna need it to survive
what we have in store for you.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.067
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.769
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

19:56.547 --> 19:58.081
A limo comes to pick us up,

19:58.115 --> 20:00.417
and it's fantastic.

20:00.451 --> 20:03.587
<i>We pull up
to the Castaway restaurant.</i>

20:03.621 --> 20:06.022
It's like a pun,
the cast is away. Castaway.

20:06.057 --> 20:08.358
[laughs]

20:08.392 --> 20:10.227
It's beautiful.

20:10.261 --> 20:11.561
- We did it today.
- Yup.

20:11.596 --> 20:12.796
- Yup.
- Congratulations, guys.

20:12.830 --> 20:13.830
- Yes.
- Congrats.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.699
It is certainly nice to sit down

20:15.733 --> 20:18.001
and just relax a moment,
have a drink.

20:18.035 --> 20:19.002
Keep that stuff coming.

20:19.036 --> 20:21.404
[laughter]

20:21.439 --> 20:23.573
- You guys both did stage two.
- Yeah.

20:23.608 --> 20:25.308
And it was way harder than
stage one, right?

20:25.343 --> 20:27.143
It was a good amount harder.

20:27.178 --> 20:29.379
So stage three...

20:29.413 --> 20:31.615
We're all safe, and we're
all having a good time,

20:31.649 --> 20:34.985
<i>but we know that the other four
are gonna go through hell</i>

20:35.019 --> 20:36.987
<i>tomorrow, and one of them
will be going home,</i>

20:37.021 --> 20:39.356
so it's
a bittersweet juxtaposition.

20:39.390 --> 20:40.790
- To Face Off.
- To Face Off.

20:40.825 --> 20:42.692
Halfway through, guys.

20:42.727 --> 20:44.327
Oh, yes.

20:48.829 --> 20:52.131
Oh, God.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.033
This is the third stage
of the Gauntlet,

20:54.068 --> 20:58.271
<i>and I see McKenzie standing
in front of a big red curtain.</i>

20:58.305 --> 20:59.739
We have no idea what's in store,

20:59.773 --> 21:01.174
<i>and that's the scariest part.</i>

21:02.410 --> 21:05.779
This third and final stage
of the Gauntlet is by far

21:05.813 --> 21:07.046
the most challenging yet.

21:08.916 --> 21:11.484
Instead of telling you
about your next challenge,

21:11.519 --> 21:13.052
I'd rather show you.

21:13.087 --> 21:14.387
Take a look.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.357
Oh, God.

21:17.358 --> 21:19.592
This giant curtain just drops.

21:19.627 --> 21:22.595
<i>There's 12 models,
and there's only four of us.</i>

21:22.630 --> 21:24.864
<i>I am in a panic right now.</i>

21:24.899 --> 21:27.600
You've all heard the popular
phrase, "See no evil,

21:27.635 --> 21:29.369
hear no evil, speak no evil,"

21:29.403 --> 21:32.539
but we've rarely seen
it manifested.

21:32.573 --> 21:34.374
That's about to change.

21:34.408 --> 21:36.276
For stage three of the Gauntlet

21:36.310 --> 21:39.813
you'll each be creating
three horrific makeups

21:39.847 --> 21:42.582
that physically
embody the phrase.

21:42.616 --> 21:44.517
Fuck.

21:44.552 --> 21:45.985
<i>Horror's not my thing.</i>

21:46.020 --> 21:47.487
<i>Hair was not my area.</i>

21:47.521 --> 21:50.557
I'm starting to feel
like this is a little personal.

21:50.591 --> 21:52.025
All right, let's get right to it

21:52.059 --> 21:54.060
because you're gonna need
all the time that you can get.

21:54.094 --> 21:56.796
Your models have been divided
into groups of three

21:56.831 --> 21:58.064
for this challenge.

21:58.098 --> 21:59.399
When I call your name, please

21:59.433 --> 22:02.035
choose a group of them
and head to your workstation.

22:02.069 --> 22:03.503
Anna, you're first.

22:03.537 --> 22:04.871
One.

22:05.906 --> 22:07.774
Three.

22:07.808 --> 22:09.809
Two.

22:09.844 --> 22:14.214
Four.

22:14.248 --> 22:16.850
You're gonna have four hours
here at the lab

22:16.884 --> 22:20.787
and an additional hour at
the reveal stage for Last Looks.

22:20.821 --> 22:24.491
Good luck, guys,
because your time starts now.

22:29.997 --> 22:31.831
It's a post-apocalyptic world,

22:31.866 --> 22:33.032
- right?
- Mm-hmm.

22:33.067 --> 22:37.337
And you're all sort of,
like, priests.

22:37.371 --> 22:39.272
<i>My concept is the same way</i>

22:39.306 --> 22:42.909
<i>that priests sacrifice sex
and worldly goods, this group</i>

22:42.943 --> 22:46.646
<i>sacrifice one of their senses
in order to be closer to God.</i>

22:46.680 --> 22:49.716
They cut the skin
and "surrender" the sense.

22:50.851 --> 22:51.951
Okay, that's kind of cool.

22:55.489 --> 22:57.023
I'm thinking something tribal,

22:57.057 --> 22:58.925
<i>but as I started looking
through the wardrobe,</i>

22:58.959 --> 23:00.527
I realized
that we have no wardrobe

23:00.561 --> 23:01.995
that matches what I want to do.

23:02.029 --> 23:03.830
None of this stuff,
like, goes together.

23:03.864 --> 23:05.565
I need to change my concept,

23:05.599 --> 23:07.233
<i>but I just need to get
the ball rolling.</i>

23:07.268 --> 23:09.168
I'm gonna start
putting on your brow piece.

23:09.203 --> 23:11.237
We're gonna
start putting prosthetics on,

23:11.272 --> 23:14.107
<i>and hopefully I can figure out
my new concept</i>

23:14.141 --> 23:15.475
<i>while I'm working.</i>

23:20.814 --> 23:22.782
You guys are just kind of,
like, doing your thing,

23:22.816 --> 23:26.052
and then the undead
come and attack you.

23:26.086 --> 23:29.622
For this challenge,
I instantly think zombies.

23:29.657 --> 23:33.059
<i>I want speak no evil
to have his jaw ripped out,</i>

23:33.093 --> 23:35.695
hear no evil to have
his ears ripped off,

23:35.729 --> 23:37.931
and see no evil to be blinded.

23:37.965 --> 23:40.466
<i>I really want them
to be terrifying and scary,</i>

23:40.501 --> 23:42.402
<i>so as I'm applying my pieces,</i>

23:42.436 --> 23:45.705
I'm also blending the edges
with some cut-in and tissue

23:45.739 --> 23:49.976
<i>and latex to just add
more of a ripped skin effect.</i>

23:50.010 --> 23:53.112
It's looking super cool,
so I'm happy where it's headed.

23:53.147 --> 23:54.814
I mean,
it's pretty gnarly-looking.

24:01.055 --> 24:02.822
Oh, man, this is nuts.

24:02.856 --> 24:04.924
This one's really hard.
It's stumping me 'cause

24:04.959 --> 24:06.993
I don't want to do
what everybody else is doing,

24:07.027 --> 24:09.262
<i>and everybody's starting
to apply prosthetics,</i>

24:09.296 --> 24:12.098
and I'm still trying
to figure out my concept.

24:12.132 --> 24:15.101
Anyone that approaches you,
you take their senses.

24:15.135 --> 24:18.504
<i>Eventually I decide that my
trio would serve the king</i>

24:18.539 --> 24:20.540
<i>by torturing civilians.</i>

24:20.574 --> 24:22.442
The civilians ended up
revolting,

24:22.476 --> 24:25.311
<i>and they end up torturing
them to death with acid,</i>

24:25.346 --> 24:29.449
so now they're ghost figures
haunting the kingdom grounds.

24:29.483 --> 24:31.951
For hear no evil,
I grab a bald cap

24:31.986 --> 24:34.754
<i>to make it look his ears
have been burnt off with acid.</i>

24:34.788 --> 24:37.390
For see no evil
I find some eye bags

24:37.424 --> 24:39.892
to represent scarring
underneath her eyes,

24:39.927 --> 24:42.762
<i>and for speak no evil
I'm using a bald cap</i>

24:42.796 --> 24:46.699
to make his mouth look
like his skin has been fused.

24:46.734 --> 24:47.934
Are you ready?

24:47.968 --> 24:49.268
Yeah?

24:52.039 --> 24:53.272
<i>I know Neville and Glenn</i>

24:53.307 --> 24:56.142
will get down on me
if the anatomy is wrong,

24:56.176 --> 24:58.678
and I've actually
taken two anatomy classes

24:58.712 --> 25:00.146
in the last two years,

25:00.180 --> 25:03.983
<i>so I'm really hoping
to mimic a realistic skin</i>

25:04.018 --> 25:09.355
and muscle structure, so I take
a two-part silicone mixture,

25:09.390 --> 25:11.624
<i>and I apply it
in roughly the area</i>

25:11.659 --> 25:14.060
<i>these flaps
would have come from,</i>

25:14.094 --> 25:18.531
and then I start to sculpt
in lines the striations.

25:18.565 --> 25:19.832
<i>It's not perfect,</i>

25:19.867 --> 25:22.068
but it's enough
that it's justified in logic.

25:22.102 --> 25:23.469
Okay, does that kind
of look like muscle?

25:23.504 --> 25:25.038
- Yeah, it does.
- Cool.

25:28.676 --> 25:30.276
I really am pushed for time,

25:30.310 --> 25:33.146
but I finally come up
with my new concept.

25:33.180 --> 25:35.515
I'm going to have these three
demons who come to Earth,

25:35.549 --> 25:38.151
<i>and instead of speaking no evil,</i>

25:38.185 --> 25:39.852
<i>seeing no evil,
and hearing no evil,</i>

25:39.887 --> 25:44.290
<i>they tempt you into seeing
the evil and hearing the evil</i>

25:44.324 --> 25:45.725
<i>and speaking the evil.</i>

25:45.759 --> 25:47.527
<i>My characters
are definitely coming together,</i>

25:47.561 --> 25:50.129
but my concept is gonna be
a hell of a lot

25:50.164 --> 25:51.597
different than everyone else's.

25:51.632 --> 25:53.866
I'm really worried if that
could hurt me with the judges.

25:53.901 --> 25:56.736
You look a lot freakier
far away.

25:56.770 --> 25:57.770
Just stay away.

25:57.805 --> 25:59.706
[laughs]

25:59.740 --> 26:02.608
I'm gonna be doing a lot
of painting in Last Looks.

26:02.643 --> 26:05.211
<i>Figuring out my concept
put me way behind,</i>

26:05.245 --> 26:06.946
<i>and now I'm under the gun.</i>

26:06.980 --> 26:09.248
There's no time
for hand painting at this point,

26:09.283 --> 26:11.217
<i>so I just start airbrushing.</i>

26:12.319 --> 26:14.020
Hopefully this is good enough.

26:15.456 --> 26:17.090
15 minutes, everyone.

26:24.998 --> 26:27.300
That is time, everyone.

26:27.334 --> 26:29.435
Oh, my God, so much to do still.

26:29.470 --> 26:33.072
I barely have base coats
on my male models,

26:33.107 --> 26:35.842
<i>and I have zero paint
on Crystal.</i>

26:35.876 --> 26:38.945
I'm thinking at this point
I'm just not gonna finish

26:38.979 --> 26:40.279
<i>and I'm going home.</i>

26:50.956 --> 26:52.824
Guys, you can just have a seat.

26:52.858 --> 26:54.726
I'm just gonna start
airbrushing just so we can get

26:54.760 --> 26:57.662
some paint on 'cause we don't
have anything on right now.

26:57.696 --> 26:59.797
<i>I am absolutely terrified.</i>

26:59.832 --> 27:00.998
This is not Last Looks.

27:01.033 --> 27:02.767
This is seriously fast looks.

27:02.801 --> 27:04.368
And I'll just put this on.

27:04.403 --> 27:08.439
I have to start airbrushing
as fast as I can possibly go.

27:08.474 --> 27:11.642
<i>Whoever's not in my chair,
they're painting themselves</i>

27:11.677 --> 27:15.279
<i>just to help me get some sort
of color on their bodies.</i>

27:18.817 --> 27:20.118
<i>This last hour is brutal.</i>

27:20.152 --> 27:21.352
Everything's at stake.

27:21.386 --> 27:23.054
<i>I'm still worried
about my concept</i>

27:23.088 --> 27:24.822
<i>being so different
than anybody else's,</i>

27:24.857 --> 27:26.457
but there's still so much to do.

27:26.492 --> 27:27.592
<i>I need contacts in.</i>

27:27.626 --> 27:28.760
<i>I need to get them painted.</i>

27:28.794 --> 27:30.695
<i>I need more contouring,
highlighting.</i>

27:30.729 --> 27:32.063
I have to get these characters
done.

27:34.199 --> 27:35.700
Stay as still as possible.

27:35.734 --> 27:37.101
<i>When I look at speak no evil,</i>

27:37.136 --> 27:41.906
I notice that the entire face is
starting to peel off of his skin

27:41.940 --> 27:43.107
and come loose.

27:43.142 --> 27:45.109
<i>I have to give it back down</i>

27:45.144 --> 27:48.179
<i>and fix some of the edges
with some makeup, move quickly,</i>

27:48.213 --> 27:51.015
and get it done because I really
don't want to go home yet.

27:54.253 --> 27:56.454
I'm actually feeling
pretty good at this point.

27:56.488 --> 28:00.124
I just need to get
these flaps tied down,

28:00.159 --> 28:03.795
<i>and I found some hemp string
in the lab that I cut up,</i>

28:03.829 --> 28:06.798
and now I'm brushing
some Tuplast on top

28:06.832 --> 28:09.667
<i>so that it creates the effect
of going into the skin.</i>

28:09.701 --> 28:11.169
I think it looks pretty cool.

28:11.203 --> 28:12.703
15 minutes, everyone.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.780
Time.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.317
Yes.

28:26.351 --> 28:28.452
Time is up, and I'm scared.

28:28.487 --> 28:30.888
<i>Everyone else's makeups
look nothing like mine.</i>

28:30.923 --> 28:32.757
<i>What am I sending on stage?</i>

28:32.791 --> 28:34.125
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

28:44.970 --> 28:47.338
Welcome to the
Face Off reveal stage.

28:47.372 --> 28:50.208
You know our multitalented
series judges,

28:50.242 --> 28:52.243
owner of Alchemy Studio,
Glenn Hetrick.

28:52.277 --> 28:54.612
- Good evening.
all: - Good evening, Glenn.

28:54.646 --> 28:57.849
Oscar and Emmy Award-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

28:57.883 --> 28:59.917
- Hello, all.
all: - Hi, Ve.

28:59.952 --> 29:02.086
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.287
- Hello.
- Hey, Neville.

29:03.322 --> 29:04.522
Hey, Neville.

29:04.556 --> 29:07.725
All right, for your final
Gauntlet challenge

29:07.759 --> 29:11.762
we asked you to show us
a terrifying trio of makeups

29:11.797 --> 29:15.032
that physically embody
the adage, "See no evil,

29:15.067 --> 29:17.335
hear no evil, speak no evil,"

29:17.369 --> 29:19.503
so without further ado,

29:19.538 --> 29:21.806
let's take a look
at your final creations.

29:53.872 --> 29:56.340
<i>I'm still a little nervous
at my concept.</i>

29:56.375 --> 29:58.109
<i>It was the first thing
I thought of,</i>

29:58.143 --> 29:59.410
but I think they look cool,

29:59.444 --> 30:00.945
and I think
they look really scary.

30:24.403 --> 30:25.870
<i>These characters look freaky.</i>

30:25.904 --> 30:27.138
<i>They go together.</i>

30:27.172 --> 30:29.640
I just hope I met the criteria
of what the judges

30:29.675 --> 30:30.975
were looking for.

30:56.501 --> 30:58.569
<i>I think
they really look cohesive.</i>

30:58.603 --> 30:59.971
<i>I wish
I applied more highlights,</i>

31:00.005 --> 31:02.340
but I'm happier than I was.

31:26.431 --> 31:28.099
<i>They look really freaking cool.</i>

31:28.133 --> 31:30.534
<i>They're all the same tone,
and they're all the same color,</i>

31:30.569 --> 31:33.070
and they really look like
they're meant to be together.

31:37.743 --> 31:40.077
Okay, judges, why don't you
go ahead and take a closer look?

31:45.650 --> 31:47.818
I wonder why they're so shiny.

31:47.853 --> 31:49.787
Yeah, I think it's...
from a distance

31:49.821 --> 31:52.556
they feel very synthetic,
almost like robots.

31:52.591 --> 31:54.959
They're also a very odd color.

31:54.993 --> 31:56.494
The mouth looks like a mess.

31:56.528 --> 31:59.530
They... It's just mounded up
on top of the performer's mouth.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.266
She painted these,

32:02.300 --> 32:03.467
- and she didn't match the face.
- Mm-hmm.

32:03.502 --> 32:05.436
It's so odd.

32:07.939 --> 32:10.074
This is just stuck on her chin.

32:10.108 --> 32:13.611
It doesn't even look
like a legitimate disease.

32:13.645 --> 32:15.946
I'm really nervous,
and I'm not sure if the judges

32:15.981 --> 32:17.581
are going
to understand my concept.

32:17.616 --> 32:19.216
None of them really say,

32:19.251 --> 32:20.684
which was the point
of the challenge,

32:20.719 --> 32:22.219
that she cannot see,

32:22.254 --> 32:24.922
she cannot speak,
and that he cannot hear.

32:24.956 --> 32:28.092
Instead, they all look quite
capable of each of those things.

32:28.126 --> 32:31.362
Hopefully the judges will have
mercy on me because I'm not

32:31.396 --> 32:32.696
ready to go home.

32:36.001 --> 32:37.868
All right, guys, it's time
to get on Twitter and tell us

32:37.903 --> 32:40.838
who made your favorite stage
three Gauntlet characters

32:40.872 --> 32:42.273
using #FaceOff

32:47.392 --> 32:49.360
That doesn't say "blind."

32:49.394 --> 32:52.062
<i>I'm not sure if the judges are
going to understand my concept.</i>

32:52.097 --> 32:53.397
I just want to be safe.

32:53.431 --> 32:56.533
None of them really say
that she cannot see,

32:56.568 --> 32:58.969
she cannot speak,
and that he cannot hear,

32:59.004 --> 33:00.471
which was the point
of the challenge.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.140
I love the mouth idea.

33:03.174 --> 33:04.375
It's seamless.

33:04.409 --> 33:05.576
Probably a bald cap.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.378
These things
really work together.

33:07.412 --> 33:08.512
She's got a brow piece

33:08.546 --> 33:09.947
on every single one
of these people,

33:09.981 --> 33:13.250
and they're all amazing.

33:13.285 --> 33:16.387
It feels so "Hellraiser,"
and I love it.

33:16.421 --> 33:18.689
I want to find out what she
used to create all that.

33:18.723 --> 33:20.057
It's very cool.

33:20.091 --> 33:21.425
Yeah.

33:24.896 --> 33:26.330
This is a creepy one.

33:26.364 --> 33:27.698
Yeah, it is.

33:27.732 --> 33:31.302
There's just enough sculpting
to imply musculature.

33:31.336 --> 33:32.636
Thank you.

33:37.709 --> 33:40.311
Okay, guys, the judges would
like to speak with each of you

33:40.345 --> 33:42.246
before making their decisions.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.814
Yvonne, you're up first.

33:52.691 --> 33:54.291
Yvonne, tell us
about your makeups, please.

33:54.326 --> 33:56.293
They served their king

33:56.328 --> 33:59.229
by torturing the civilians
with acid,

33:59.264 --> 34:01.498
and then the civilians revolted

34:01.533 --> 34:05.803
and tortured them to death
the same way they were tortured.

34:05.837 --> 34:08.472
It's really impressive.

34:08.505 --> 34:12.676
I love how they feel like they
come from the same world,

34:12.710 --> 34:14.011
and the wardrobe choices

34:14.045 --> 34:17.047
to augment the makeups
that you did are spectacular.

34:17.081 --> 34:18.614
Thank you so much.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.884
They all are beautifully
blended.

34:20.918 --> 34:22.485
You addressed everything.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.054
The makeup's beautifully done.

34:24.089 --> 34:27.858
They do all look
appropriately ghostly.

34:27.891 --> 34:31.695
You have a perfect ensemble
here in character design.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.831
Your makeup choice,
your palettes created

34:33.864 --> 34:35.666
such a beautiful ensemble.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.134
Thank you so much.

34:37.168 --> 34:42.272
Yvonne, thank you very much.
Please step back.

34:42.306 --> 34:43.440
Great job.

34:43.475 --> 34:45.074
Thank you.

34:45.110 --> 34:46.543
Anna, please step forward.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.853
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi.

34:55.887 --> 34:58.188
Would you please tell us
about this horrifying trio?

34:58.223 --> 35:00.524
These people were traveling
in the winter.

35:00.558 --> 35:04.661
A group of undead came
and, you know, tore them apart,

35:04.696 --> 35:06.363
so now they are the undead.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.298
They have such bizarre coloring.

35:10.702 --> 35:13.404
Nothing matches, especially
on your number three character

35:13.438 --> 35:14.538
here closest to you.

35:14.572 --> 35:16.173
Her hands are stone-cold white,

35:16.207 --> 35:19.276
and she looks like she
has a very healthy tan going on.

35:20.812 --> 35:22.913
The mouth gag,

35:22.947 --> 35:26.417
it feels like there's a whole
lower piece connected to him.

35:26.451 --> 35:28.485
It feels like her eyes
are stuck on,

35:28.520 --> 35:31.388
and because of that,
they feel a little bit spotty.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.725
You have to try
to create negative space

35:34.759 --> 35:36.260
where it doesn't exist,

35:36.294 --> 35:39.096
so if you'd brought some skin
around the edges of the mouth

35:39.130 --> 35:40.597
so it felt set in,

35:40.632 --> 35:43.066
it might have felt
more like his lips were missing.

35:43.101 --> 35:44.334
Yeah.

35:44.369 --> 35:45.736
Anna, thank you very much.

35:45.770 --> 35:47.070
Please step back.

35:51.843 --> 35:53.410
All right, let's talk to Kaleb.

36:00.385 --> 36:02.886
Kaleb, tell us about your trio
of characters.

36:02.921 --> 36:06.457
They're pan-dimensional demons
who have come to Earth.

36:06.491 --> 36:09.860
They try to tempt humans
into seeing and speaking

36:09.894 --> 36:11.295
and hearing evil.

36:11.329 --> 36:13.163
That's the part
that's confusing.

36:15.133 --> 36:18.635
It feels like the intended
occluded senses

36:18.670 --> 36:21.305
are so non-demonstrative,

36:21.339 --> 36:22.906
and if anything,
they're confusing.

36:22.941 --> 36:24.842
For example,
she's looking at me,

36:24.876 --> 36:26.043
which means she can see me,

36:26.077 --> 36:29.179
so she's not without vision.

36:29.214 --> 36:32.683
I really wish at least one of
them hit the nail on the head.

36:32.717 --> 36:34.785
You, of all people,
I thought would have found a way

36:34.819 --> 36:38.222
to pull a headband down
over see no evil's eyes.

36:38.256 --> 36:40.190
You can create
this really cool look,

36:40.225 --> 36:41.391
and then you could have just
built the makeup

36:41.426 --> 36:42.726
around the edges of that.

36:43.862 --> 36:46.396
Your makeups are a little bit
too messy.

36:46.431 --> 36:49.466
Your model on the left,
the black doesn't look lived in.

36:49.501 --> 36:50.868
It doesn't look realistic.

36:50.902 --> 36:53.337
It looks very painted on,
so for me, honey,

36:53.371 --> 36:55.272
this doesn't fulfill
the challenge today.

36:56.674 --> 36:58.175
Kaleb, please step back.

36:58.209 --> 36:59.510
Thank you.

37:04.048 --> 37:05.582
Mel, please step to the center.

37:10.889 --> 37:12.322
- Hi, Mel.
- Hi.

37:12.357 --> 37:13.824
Tell us about your makeups.

37:13.858 --> 37:16.894
They're these people that live
in a post-apocalyptic world,

37:16.928 --> 37:21.331
and the same way that priests
give up sex and alcohol

37:21.366 --> 37:22.866
in order to be closer to God,

37:22.901 --> 37:24.668
they have to surrender
one of their senses

37:24.702 --> 37:26.537
in this sort of ceremony.

37:26.571 --> 37:29.573
This is such a focused vision.

37:30.642 --> 37:33.577
I love some of the fine details.

37:33.611 --> 37:36.179
The way that the flap
comes down off of her forehead

37:36.214 --> 37:37.548
in see no evil,

37:37.582 --> 37:39.950
that is exactly how you'd have
to excise the skin.

37:39.984 --> 37:43.954
The well-thought-out execution
of the makeups is something

37:43.988 --> 37:46.957
I would expect from a team
on a much bigger challenge.

37:46.991 --> 37:48.191
Thank you.

37:48.226 --> 37:50.527
Your coloring is fantastic.

37:50.562 --> 37:53.330
Where the skin has been pulled
away, beautiful coloration,

37:53.364 --> 37:54.798
looks like the inside of skin.

37:54.832 --> 37:56.333
Everything is very cohesive.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.235
It looks fantastic
with their wardrobe.

37:58.269 --> 37:59.903
- Nice job, Mel.
- Thank you.

37:59.938 --> 38:02.272
Each of my comments
comes with an exclamation mark.

38:02.307 --> 38:07.544
Evocative, emotional,
visceral, creative,

38:07.579 --> 38:10.714
but I'll end with a "Fuck yeah".

38:10.748 --> 38:12.783
- This is beautiful work.
- Thank you.

38:12.817 --> 38:14.217
Mel, you can step back.

38:14.252 --> 38:15.586
Thank you guys.

38:21.225 --> 38:23.226
All right, guys, please head
back to the makeup room

38:23.261 --> 38:24.828
while the judges deliberate.

38:24.862 --> 38:26.196
Thank you.

38:29.734 --> 38:31.201
All right, judges,
so a reminder that you guys

38:31.235 --> 38:34.938
still haven't used your one-time
special immunity this season.

38:34.973 --> 38:37.474
So with that, why don't we talk
about what you saw here tonight?

38:37.508 --> 38:39.610
Let's start with Yvonne's work.

38:39.644 --> 38:42.479
<i>It felt like they stepped
right out of a story,</i>

38:42.513 --> 38:45.048
<i>like they're background
from a film or something.</i>

38:45.083 --> 38:48.185
It was superb
from the standpoint

38:48.219 --> 38:49.853
<i>of character and styling.</i>

38:49.887 --> 38:51.321
And the paint jobs
were all beautiful

38:51.356 --> 38:52.522
on every single one of them.

38:52.557 --> 38:54.958
All right,
why don't we move on to Mel?

38:54.993 --> 38:57.961
<i>The fabrication,
the technical execution,</i>

38:57.996 --> 39:01.164
<i>the ideas conceptually,
so well-thought out.</i>

39:01.199 --> 39:03.700
The underside
of the skin looked authentic.

39:03.735 --> 39:05.736
<i>And it all fit
together really well.</i>

39:05.770 --> 39:07.170
All right,
let's move on to Anna.

39:07.205 --> 39:09.740
<i>What concerned me
the most is these were zombies,</i>

39:09.774 --> 39:13.377
<i>and they did not look like
zombies, especially the color.</i>

39:13.411 --> 39:16.913
That gloss was the polar
opposite of zombie.

39:16.948 --> 39:18.682
<i>Yeah, she should
powder that down.</i>

39:18.716 --> 39:19.916
<i>It probably would have helped</i>

39:19.951 --> 39:21.885
<i>the color
look more like rotten flesh.</i>

39:21.919 --> 39:24.154
They could have came out
like they were covered in dust

39:24.188 --> 39:26.590
or dirt, like they had just
crawled out of the grave,

39:26.624 --> 39:27.858
and this whole thing probably

39:27.892 --> 39:29.192
would have went
a little bit better for her.

39:29.227 --> 39:30.193
- Mm-hmm.
- All right,

39:30.228 --> 39:31.294
let's move on to Kaleb.

39:31.329 --> 39:33.130
<i>This whole David Bowie remaking</i>

39:33.164 --> 39:35.966
<i>"Rocky Horror Picture Show"
high concept fashion thing,</i>

39:36.000 --> 39:37.601
just not right
for this challenge.

39:37.635 --> 39:39.069
At first glance,

39:39.103 --> 39:42.272
<i>they do look like a couple
of hookers and their pimp.</i>

39:42.306 --> 39:45.876
And the see no evil
felt so substandard.

39:45.910 --> 39:47.911
Judges, have you made
your decisions?

39:47.945 --> 39:49.079
Afraid so.

39:49.113 --> 39:50.247
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:55.219 --> 39:57.354
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

39:57.388 --> 40:00.991
Yvonne, you made really great
color and wardrobe choices,

40:01.025 --> 40:02.759
and we thought
that there was a true harmony

40:02.794 --> 40:04.361
among all of your characters.

40:04.395 --> 40:07.664
Mel, your concept was so strong,

40:07.699 --> 40:10.067
and being zeroed
in like that allowed you to make

40:10.101 --> 40:13.637
some really interesting details
throughout your makeup.

40:13.671 --> 40:15.405
All right, so who is
the winner of this challenge?

40:15.440 --> 40:17.107
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:24.103 --> 40:25.170
All right,

40:25.204 --> 40:26.438
so who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:26.472 --> 40:30.308
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:31.811 --> 40:35.047
Mel.

40:35.081 --> 40:36.448
Between the super high concept

40:36.482 --> 40:40.118
and the fact that we knew
exactly what the challenge was

40:40.153 --> 40:41.486
just by looking
at your characters,

40:41.521 --> 40:43.422
you killed it tonight,

40:43.456 --> 40:44.589
so well done.

40:44.624 --> 40:45.757
Thank you.

40:45.792 --> 40:48.026
I win.

40:48.061 --> 40:50.829
It feels like winning
the Hunger Games.

40:50.863 --> 40:53.598
Whatever comes next,
I'm ready for it.

40:53.633 --> 40:55.567
- Mel, congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:55.601 --> 40:58.402
You and Yvonne can head back
to the makeup room.

40:59.673 --> 41:02.207
- Bye, guys.
- See you.

41:06.746 --> 41:08.113
All right, guys.

41:08.147 --> 41:10.048
That means you
two are on the bottom this week,

41:10.083 --> 41:12.651
and one of you will be
going home tonight.

41:12.685 --> 41:14.019
Please step forward.

41:21.427 --> 41:23.628
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

41:23.863 --> 41:25.997
Anna, the zombie concept
could have worked,

41:26.032 --> 41:27.866
but the paint got muddy,

41:27.900 --> 41:30.201
and overall it really
took away from the look

41:30.236 --> 41:31.703
of your characters,

41:31.737 --> 41:34.839
and Kaleb, your concept was
definitely bold and interesting

41:34.874 --> 41:36.908
but seemed like it would be
a better fit

41:36.943 --> 41:38.944
for a different challenge.

41:39.278 --> 41:41.012
So who's going home tonight?

41:41.046 --> 41:46.251
The person
going home tonight is...

41:46.285 --> 41:48.653
Kaleb.

41:48.687 --> 41:51.823
Your vision was not communicated
to us clearly this week,

41:51.857 --> 41:53.024
and there weren't really

41:53.058 --> 41:55.460
any standout moments
for us to latch onto.

41:57.062 --> 42:00.298
Kaleb, I'm sorry,
but you've been eliminated.

42:00.332 --> 42:01.833
That means Anna,

42:01.867 --> 42:03.901
you're safe this week and can
head back to the makeup room.

42:03.936 --> 42:06.118
Thank you.
I love you.

42:06.438 --> 42:11.109
Kaleb,
I have a sneaking suspicion

42:11.143 --> 42:12.810
that you have a lot left
to offer,

42:12.845 --> 42:15.647
and I very much look forward to
seeing your work after the show.

42:15.681 --> 42:16.881
- Thank you.
- Kaleb,

42:16.915 --> 42:19.384
it's been so great
having you here with us.

42:19.418 --> 42:21.619
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

42:21.654 --> 42:23.855
- and pack up your kit?
- Thank you, guys.

42:23.889 --> 42:24.889
- Thank you, Kaleb.
- Take care, now.

42:24.923 --> 42:26.157
- Bye, honey.
- Good luck.

42:26.191 --> 42:28.159
Thank you.

42:28.193 --> 42:30.194
<i>It's definitely a bummer
to go home now.</i>

42:30.229 --> 42:35.233
I feel like I haven't been able
to showcase my true potential.

42:38.437 --> 42:40.805
- It's me.
- Oh.

42:40.839 --> 42:43.908

and I can't wait to get
my makeup career started.
