00:21.041 --> 00:25.416
Every once in a while,
man accomplishes the impossible.

00:26.166 --> 00:29.125
<i>Visual confirm. Landing gear deployed.</i>

00:29.833 --> 00:32.250
<i>Copy that, Columbia.
The Eagle has wings.</i>

00:33.041 --> 00:35.625
All it takes
is someone with a dream.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.250
<i>Godspeed, Eagle.</i>

00:38.250 --> 00:39.666
Because when a man dreams...

00:41.208 --> 00:42.750
...you know what happens.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.958
He can change the world.

00:44.958 --> 00:46.166
All right, cut.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.541
Okay, listen. I don't want
to obstruct your process here,

00:50.541 --> 00:53.458
but I'm looking at the script,
and I'm pretty sure... Yep.

00:53.458 --> 00:56.500
There are zero of those words in it.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.583
True, but only because
the words in the script are dog shit.

00:59.583 --> 01:02.333
All right. Now, look.
Look. Just forget the words.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.750
Ride the truth, buddy.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.666
You're Dr. John Carpenter,
idealistic ghetto physician.

01:06.666 --> 01:10.416
You help everybody: the poor, the sick,
the hungry. You know, blah, blah, blah.

01:10.416 --> 01:12.375
You're Jesus, mate. You're the journey.

01:12.375 --> 01:15.208
Your journey is the journey of America.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.791
And at some point,
you make out with a nun.

01:17.791 --> 01:18.958
Oh, and how good is that?

01:18.958 --> 01:21.000
Yeah. Well, listen up here, rookie.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.166
America doesn't make out with nuns.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.125
Oh yeah?
Well, that's America's loss, isn't it?

01:26.125 --> 01:29.583
All right, listen up.
We're gonna go again. And action!

01:31.958 --> 01:33.458
What the fuck?

01:33.458 --> 01:36.291
Oh come on, people.
What's more important?

01:36.291 --> 01:40.041
Some human buzz cuts
riding a glorified firework to a rock,

01:40.041 --> 01:44.041
or the living art
that we're here making on Earth?

01:46.583 --> 01:48.375
All right, fuck me, let's take five.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.500
<i>Direct from our newsroom in New York,</i>

01:58.500 --> 02:02.041
<i>this is the CBS Evening News
with Walter Cronkite.</i>

02:02.041 --> 02:06.750
<i>The lunar module will descend
to the surface in the next few hours.</i>

02:06.750 --> 02:10.166
<i>The heroism of these men
cannot be overstated.</i>

02:10.166 --> 02:11.958
Oh, will you look at that.

02:11.958 --> 02:16.708
Hmm. Say, you ever get the feeling
we could be doing something more?

02:16.708 --> 02:17.875
- More?
- Yeah.

02:17.875 --> 02:20.375
You know, something,
I don't know... bigger.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.916
Nothing bigger than being Elvis.

02:21.916 --> 02:24.291
I mean, look here.
Right in front of us, right now,

02:24.291 --> 02:28.916
human beings are about to land
on the goddamn moon.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.333
Ha! And what am I doing?

02:30.333 --> 02:33.833
Well, the next scene, you teach a child
about tolerance through the power of song,

02:33.833 --> 02:36.083
which apparently makes a nun horny.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.291
Yet somehow, not enough.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.750
You feeling okay, boss?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.958
Be better if I was on that space capsule.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.458
Oh, bullshit? This is not bullshit.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.833
This is a giant moment in history.

02:48.833 --> 02:52.125
You know it. Right up there
with your comeback TV special.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.125
Arguably.

02:54.833 --> 02:57.250
Hey. You promised me you'd quit that shit.

02:59.083 --> 03:03.083
Technically speaking, boss, he said
he'd quit coke every day except Tuesdays.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.833
Ooh, cocaine Tuesdays? Love it.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.958
It's like taco Tuesdays,
but for awesome people.

03:07.958 --> 03:10.708
Oh, goddamn it. What are you doing here?

03:10.708 --> 03:13.291
Uh, eating, obviously.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.583
Oh my God.

03:14.583 --> 03:18.666
Oh, I would kill an actual human baby
for, like, ten of these.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.958
What? No, not one I know. Jesus.

03:21.958 --> 03:24.083
So, what, is this what you do?

03:24.083 --> 03:26.458
You just keep showing up
whenever you feel like it?

03:26.458 --> 03:28.375
Same way I got into Yale. True story.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.375
But look, I want--

03:29.375 --> 03:31.791
Stop. I don't even
want to know why you're here.

03:31.791 --> 03:33.583
What? I'm just a huge fan.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.625
Well, of your movies. They're hilarious.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.875
I mean, not the comedies, obviously.

03:37.875 --> 03:41.416
- There's a compliment in there somewhere.
- Enough. You need to go. Now.

03:41.416 --> 03:42.500
Fine. Rude.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.541
Uh-oh, missed a spot there. I gotcha.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.000
Get rid of this.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.125
Where the fuck
are you getting all this coke?

03:56.041 --> 03:57.000
Flyboy?

03:57.500 --> 04:01.166
Oh, he's this fella selling maps
to movie star houses in the parking lot.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.708
Oh, and a shit-ton of cocaine.
Probably should've led with that.

04:03.708 --> 04:05.583
- How about you introduce me?
- Now?

04:05.583 --> 04:06.875
What about the next scene?

04:06.875 --> 04:10.541
Okay, people.
Nuns, put on your roller skates.

04:10.541 --> 04:11.583
It can wait.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.833
Hold up.

04:13.833 --> 04:18.000
Set's that way, but you're heading
this way. Seems like a disconnect.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.125
Oh, just gonna step out for a bit.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.083
Uh-huh? Then what's with
the vigilante face?

04:23.083 --> 04:24.333
What vigilante face?

04:24.333 --> 04:30.125
The one that comes right before some
godforsaken karate, gunfight, bloodbath.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.916
Oh, you mean that vigilante face.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.291
Come on. We're here to make a movie.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.208
The director's setting up the next shot.

04:38.208 --> 04:42.333
Oh, now, just relax, Miss Bertie.
Heck, it's just an over-the-shoulder shot.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.333
Bobby Ray can stand in for me.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.666
Am I the only one
who remembers how badly this can go?

04:48.666 --> 04:51.250
Ha-ha! Hang on. Are we already filming?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.125
Wait, is that my beer back there?

04:54.625 --> 04:57.583
Hmm, and we're still paying
for that poor boy.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.791
Oh, relax. No kids in this movie.
He'll do great.

05:00.791 --> 05:04.375
Puerto Rican street urchins,
over here, <i>por favor.</i> Chop-chop!

05:04.375 --> 05:07.250
Um, I'm not actually Puerto Rican.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.416
Yeah, well, none of you are.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.750
That's why God invented
the magic of makeup, mate.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.666
Do you even read these scripts?

05:12.666 --> 05:14.625
I actually try not to.

05:19.666 --> 05:22.291
Holy shit. Fucking Elvis.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.250
Oh man. Oh wow.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.208
What are you, a doctor now?

05:26.208 --> 05:29.916
Uh, let me guess. You're Flyboy?

05:29.916 --> 05:30.833
Uh...

05:35.583 --> 05:37.625
Does that answer your question?

05:37.625 --> 05:38.958
- Not remotely.
- All right.

05:38.958 --> 05:41.708
So, uh, you want a star map or what?

05:41.708 --> 05:45.083
Five buck extra gets you
Paul Newman's gate code.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.208
Tell you what, Flyboy.

05:47.208 --> 05:50.291
I'm a lot more interested
in that other shit you're selling.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.125
- Know what I mean?
- Ah.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.958
Right, right, right. Yeah.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.708
Check it out.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.583
So, tell me, Flyboy,

05:57.583 --> 06:00.416
if you're a drug dealer,
how come you're dressed like a pimp?

06:00.416 --> 06:03.291
Okay. Yeah, well,
I mean, there is some overlap.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.500
But come on,
you want some of this coke or not?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.458
More like all of it.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.208
All of it? Oh.

06:09.708 --> 06:10.958
Oh!

06:10.958 --> 06:14.250
Well, guess who's
an official fucking Elvis fan!

06:14.250 --> 06:15.708
Right on, man!

06:15.708 --> 06:16.791
All right. All right.

06:16.791 --> 06:19.541
Now, um, I don't normally
deal in bulk, but I--

06:19.541 --> 06:20.791
- Shut up.
- Uh, done.

06:20.791 --> 06:24.416
Now, ordinarily, I'd just kick your ass
for being a piece-of-shit drug dealer

06:24.416 --> 06:26.958
who happens to be dressed like a pimp,
and I'd be on my way,

06:26.958 --> 06:29.375
but I'm having kind of
a weird fucking morning.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.458
- I mean, honestly, same here.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.125
- And I'm after bigger fish than you today.
- Right.

06:35.125 --> 06:39.041
Long story, but I'm kinda pissed off
that I am not in space right now.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.916
Yeah, that tracks. That makes sense to me.

06:41.916 --> 06:45.166
But I can't exactly walk around
without being noticed.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.708
So, I'll need to borrow a few things.

06:50.791 --> 06:55.250
Wow, that actually looks way better
on you than it did on me, honestly.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.750
Yeah, like nobody saw that coming.

07:03.625 --> 07:06.625
<i>Mission Control awaits word. The lunar--</i>

07:07.708 --> 07:09.625
<i>What are you doing, Agent Ryder?</i>

07:09.625 --> 07:10.833
Um, nothing.

07:10.833 --> 07:11.875
<i>Oh good, good.</i>

07:11.875 --> 07:16.291
<i>Then you have plenty of time to tell me
why Elvis isn't on his Elvis movie set,</i>

07:16.291 --> 07:20.791
<i>which, as you know,
is extremely important to me.</i>

07:20.791 --> 07:24.083
Oh, fist me sideways!
Where the hell'd he go?

07:26.791 --> 07:27.916
So where are we headed?

07:27.916 --> 07:30.708
Come on, man.
You know I can't tell you that.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.291
Because snitches end up
getting fucking stitches.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.791
- Yeah, I heard somebody say that once.

07:35.791 --> 07:38.125
But you know what's worse than stitches?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.416
Turns out I do.

07:40.958 --> 07:44.666
Okay. E, but baby,
whatever you do, don't hurt the coat.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.125
I actually get that.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.166
Paging Dr. John Carpenter.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.041
Damn it!

07:59.041 --> 08:00.750
Uh, shouldn't you be making a movie now?

08:00.750 --> 08:02.583
All right, look,
just cut the shit, will you?

08:02.583 --> 08:05.208
- What are you really up to?
- Oh my God, paranoid. Nothing.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.125
- Where's the trust?
- Irradiated.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.875
In a nuclear fireball back in Vegas.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.416
Okay, so, what's this?

08:11.416 --> 08:14.166
Sneaking out
on another little vigilante kick?

08:14.166 --> 08:16.125
Just a man standing against the tide.

08:16.125 --> 08:19.791
Yeah, which totally works.
That's why you don't see tides anymore.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.583
It's called making a difference.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.750
No, it's not.
It's called a complete waste of time.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.958
I know what this is really about,
so let me bottom-line it for you.

08:26.958 --> 08:29.625
No matter how many tiny little
drug dealers you take down,

08:29.625 --> 08:31.083
it won't get you to the moon today.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.208
- You got mustard on your face.
- Yes, I know.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.125
You good with that?
Walking around with mustard on your face?

08:36.125 --> 08:38.750
Oh shit! Dr. Carpenter carries a gun?

08:38.750 --> 08:40.541
Ooh! Plot twist.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.250
Whoa, whoa, wait. What's the line again?

08:42.250 --> 08:45.208
Your line is, "Yes." Fucking dipshit.

08:48.541 --> 08:49.500
Night vision.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.125
Oh shit. Goddamn it.

08:53.125 --> 08:56.625
Hmm. Okay. As much as I did love
the on-fire glasses,

08:57.791 --> 08:59.375
these fuckers see through walls.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.708
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.500
And if you reverse the polarity,
they'll scorch a human eyeball.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.833
I'm talking full-on badass here.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.416
- Bullshit.
- Just ask my roommate.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.125
But don't look her
in the eyes when you do,

09:08.125 --> 09:09.541
because they look super weird now.

09:09.541 --> 09:10.791
Ooh!

09:10.791 --> 09:12.458
Yes, please.

09:13.416 --> 09:16.458
Uh, oh my. Okay, I am so moving here.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.791
Okay, as soon as those guys move out.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.958
Yeah, cool, but how much for the goggles?

09:20.958 --> 09:23.958
Oh, you can't afford them.
Beatles money, maybe, but not you.

09:23.958 --> 09:27.000
Any chance
your "magic goggles" can tell me

09:27.000 --> 09:29.125
what's waiting
on the other side of that door?

09:29.125 --> 09:30.916
Where's the fun in that, dumbass?

09:30.916 --> 09:32.166
Just hurry this up.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.791
Dr. Carpenter has to cure
an orphan's tuberculosis

09:34.791 --> 09:36.541
by making him believe in himself.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.583
Oh God, that script's a piece of shit.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.083

11:02.791 --> 11:05.291
Whoa, you sound
just like my mother when I was little.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.833
Sounds like a super lady.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.500
She paid me in cigarettes, by the way.
So, yeah, real gem.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.333
About to lose a lot more than that tooth.

11:32.333 --> 11:36.541
Talk. That was way more
than just local dealer coke up there.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.250
That shipment. There's a...

11:44.791 --> 11:46.958
Goddamn it, Scatter!

11:57.333 --> 12:00.416
Oh man!
This looks so cool through these.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.541
Hey, it's snowing!

12:09.333 --> 12:10.625
It's snowing!

12:10.625 --> 12:12.208
- It's snowing!
-  Yay!

12:12.791 --> 12:14.041
Yay!

12:15.125 --> 12:17.166
Damn it, Scatter. Get back here.

12:18.583 --> 12:21.041
- Fucking Tuesdays.
-  Well, look at it this way.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.500
You know, at least you introduced
a bunch of kids to the dangers of drugs

12:24.500 --> 12:27.041
by actually giving them a ton of drugs.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.583
Hey! You're ditching me?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.708
Yes!

12:32.666 --> 12:33.875
- What?
-  "Yes."

12:33.875 --> 12:36.375
"Yes" to what?
Me saying the line, or that's the line?

12:36.375 --> 12:39.125
Just say it, mate. "Yes."

12:39.125 --> 12:41.583
Okay. I mean, yes! Damn it!

12:41.583 --> 12:43.000
-  Cut!

12:44.250 --> 12:45.166
Where's Elvis?

12:45.166 --> 12:48.166
Just, uh, stepped out
to buy some cigarettes.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.458
He doesn't smoke.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.958
Did I say cigarettes? I meant Cadillacs.

12:52.958 --> 12:56.500
You realize how incredibly bad you are
at lying to me, right?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.708
Sadly, I do.

12:58.791 --> 13:00.125
What the fuck?

13:00.125 --> 13:02.791
Oh damn, E.
What the hell happened to my coat?

13:02.791 --> 13:03.875
Different things.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.666
Shit, man. You know
how much that fucking coat costs?

13:06.666 --> 13:09.791
Yeah, you're gonna tell me
about expensive clothes.

13:09.791 --> 13:12.291
Look here, rookie,
what you need to talk about instead

13:12.291 --> 13:14.000
is the cocaine shipment.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.041
The same cocaine shipment
somebody else was telling me about

13:17.041 --> 13:19.375
before somebody else exploded.

13:19.375 --> 13:22.583
Somebody fucking exploded?
What the... And what shipment?

13:22.583 --> 13:25.250
They don't tell me shit, man. Okay?

13:25.250 --> 13:26.458
- I swear.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.416
You see that? That means
Scatter doesn't like your answer.

13:30.416 --> 13:34.541
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
Just go find Big Rod. He'll know.

13:34.541 --> 13:38.416
He's always down by Pier 4.
I swear, this time for real.

13:38.416 --> 13:40.833
I'm gonna have a bruise on my dick.

13:40.833 --> 13:44.291
Good. And listen, Flyboy.
Sorry about the coat.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.875
What the hell are you wearing?

13:48.458 --> 13:49.541
Ooh, long story.

13:49.541 --> 13:51.958
Looks like you stole some pimp's clothes.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.208
So it's not just me.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.750
- And what are you doing?
- Just dropped by to grab a few things.

13:55.750 --> 13:58.000
You mean a bunch of guns and bullets.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.666
Uh-huh, see, I know
your I'm-out-of-ammo face when I see it.

14:02.666 --> 14:05.666
What we need
is to get you back to that set right now.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.666
- Bobby Ray can handle it.
- Wanna bet?

14:07.666 --> 14:09.000
And action!

14:09.583 --> 14:11.250
Now, hang on a sec. Uh...

14:11.833 --> 14:13.208
What's my motivation?

14:13.208 --> 14:14.916
For opening a door, you dipshit?

14:14.916 --> 14:16.916
You want to be
on the other side of the door.

14:20.958 --> 14:24.541
<i>It's moments like these
that truly make you feel like</i>

14:24.541 --> 14:27.125
<i>- we're part of the tides of history.</i>

14:37.458 --> 14:39.166
- Just quit it, will you?

14:39.166 --> 14:41.500
I know you're bitter
because you washed out of NASA.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.500
"Full of shit"? Who, Neil Armstrong?

14:45.500 --> 14:48.458
<i>American heroes, each and every one.</i>

14:48.458 --> 14:53.291
<i>The hopes and dreams of an entire nation
rest on their shoulders.</i>

14:53.291 --> 14:57.750
CeCe, I noticed
Elvis still isn't on the set,

14:57.750 --> 15:00.208
with menacing emphasis on "still."

15:00.208 --> 15:01.750
Yeah, I know. I'm working on it.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.250
- Might want to work faster.
- Yes, sir. Understood.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.041
Funny unrelated story.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.500
I once had to wait too long
for an appetizer,

15:11.500 --> 15:15.416
so I carved the waiter's femur
into a salad fork.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.583
Oh my God. You should have seen
the look on his grandkids' faces.

15:19.583 --> 15:22.541
And what the hell were his grandkids
doing there? So many questions.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.416
Oh good. You made it back.

15:25.416 --> 15:29.041
So now I guess we're overcompensating
for our moon-landing inadequacies.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.416
Quit it with that crap.

15:30.416 --> 15:31.833
Listen, I get it.

15:31.833 --> 15:34.083
When my mom beat me
in a wet T-shirt contest,

15:34.083 --> 15:36.375
I stopped eating for three months
and burned the bar down.

15:37.791 --> 15:41.625
- Where are we headed?
- There's no "we" happening here.

15:41.625 --> 15:44.416
And you still have mustard on your face.

15:44.416 --> 15:47.416
- Thank you for noticing me. I feel seen.
- You're not getting it.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.541
- Well, at least let me give you a ride.
- No, thanks.

15:49.541 --> 15:52.041
- Oh yeah? You sure about that, big guy?

15:58.625 --> 16:02.833
<i>Shouldn't be long now as we await word
from the valiant crew of Apollo 11</i>

16:02.833 --> 16:04.291

16:04.291 --> 16:06.041
Come on, guys. Get it done.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.083
Yeah, speaking of,
how about we get this done

16:08.083 --> 16:10.541
- and get you back to that set?
- No, the movie can wait.

16:10.541 --> 16:12.833
We're trying to stop
a major drug shipment here.

16:12.833 --> 16:16.250
Yeah, which there are literally
thousands of every fucking day.

16:17.208 --> 16:19.000
Where'd you score this ride, by the way?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.583
It's pretty great, right? Company car.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.333
- Mind if I push these buttons?
- Sure.

16:22.333 --> 16:28.166
Wait. And not get electrocuted or ejected
out of my seat or some other bullshit.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.416
Oh, then, no.
No, I wouldn't touch most of those.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.708
Uh, thank you?

16:33.708 --> 16:35.708
He wants to know if there's any booze.

16:35.708 --> 16:39.000
It's a high-performance, state-of-the-art
intelligence-gathering asset.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.708
It's the third button on your right.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.708
Make that the fourth button
on your right. I think.

16:52.708 --> 16:55.083
Oh my God.
You know we'll never find this guy, right?

16:55.083 --> 16:58.541
Yep. That's why God invented
dickheads with vanity plates.

17:02.750 --> 17:03.583
Hey, buddy.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.375
Need to have a word.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.375
Damn it, Scatter!

17:10.375 --> 17:13.375
- The buttons are not toys!

17:38.083 --> 17:41.041
Looks like you're all out
of foot-chase clichés.

17:41.666 --> 17:43.291
What the hell do you want?

17:43.291 --> 17:44.958
Tell me about the drug shipment.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.625
Shit, man,
Cleopatra shipped out with that yesterday.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.666
Cleopatra?

17:51.041 --> 17:53.666
- Kinda sick of you guys ditching me.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.083
So where's this major
big-time drug shipment anyway?

17:57.458 --> 17:58.750
Already gone.

17:58.750 --> 17:59.791
Oh good.

17:59.791 --> 18:02.500
Okay. So, I guess
that makes this, to quote myself,

18:02.500 --> 18:04.291
"A complete fucking waste of..."

18:07.458 --> 18:08.583
"...time." Damn it.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.791
Uh, sorry.
What was that you were you saying?

18:10.791 --> 18:14.125
Something about you
being completely wrong?

18:15.583 --> 18:16.708
Nice coat.

18:20.791 --> 18:22.125
Cover you? Wait, wait...

18:36.000 --> 18:37.375

18:38.375 --> 18:40.458
We need a plan, all right?
They're getting away.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.125
Here's a plan: who gives a shit?

18:42.125 --> 18:43.750
- Cover me!
- Ah, fuck.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.125
I hate hero time.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.166
For the record, my "Who gives a shit?"
plan was way easier.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.375
<i>Angle down three. Ten feet.</i>

19:06.750 --> 19:10.125
<i>Houston, Tranquility Base here.

19:15.791 --> 19:16.625
Wait for it.

19:16.625 --> 19:17.625
For what?

19:17.625 --> 19:20.458
You giving away my fucking car?
Already checked that box.

19:20.458 --> 19:24.208
No, I pushed all the buttons
before I dove out.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.750
That car's gonna explode
all over the place.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.041
Wait, you pushed all the buttons?

19:29.041 --> 19:30.583
- Yeah.
- Oh shit.

19:30.583 --> 19:32.541
- What?
- That just locks the doors.

19:33.833 --> 19:36.458
But it did come
with this fun little doohickey

19:36.458 --> 19:38.083
from the Philadelphia office.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.458
- Holy shit.
- Big time.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.375
Where'd it go?

19:46.375 --> 19:48.583
Oh, I don't know.
We haven't figured that out yet.

19:49.583 --> 19:50.833
What's with the dumpy face?

19:50.833 --> 19:52.416
Missed the moon landing.

19:52.416 --> 19:55.000
All right, don't pout.
I'm sure we can get them to do it again.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.208
- What?
-  Just... follow me.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.750
-  Come on. Is anybody out there?

19:59.750 --> 20:03.333
Fuck that fucking monkey
shoving a gun in my fucking dick.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.625

20:13.291 --> 20:15.708
- Line.
- You don't fucking have one!

20:15.708 --> 20:17.041
Just stand there!

20:17.666 --> 20:20.083

bloody well spend 12 years

20:20.083 --> 20:22.791

20:25.291 --> 20:28.625
Oh, I hear you. That sounds frustrating.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.166
- Who's the moron?
- Ugh!

20:30.166 --> 20:32.250
Fuck this. I'm out of here.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.958

Even financed that dogshit movie

21:07.500 --> 21:09.208

21:39.541 --> 21:40.916
Aw, he in the can?

21:40.916 --> 21:45.125
No. He somehow accidentally
drank a Tang laced with cocaine,

21:45.125 --> 21:46.750
and now he's coked out of his mind

21:46.750 --> 21:49.041

21:49.041 --> 21:50.666

21:50.666 --> 21:52.833
