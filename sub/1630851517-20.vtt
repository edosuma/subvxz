<i>Previously on</i>
Young Sheldon...

00:03.503 --> 00:04.604
I'm pregnant.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.707
I heard them talking
about a baby.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.709
{\an5}Oh, my.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.709
You know what that means.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.711
{\an5}Mom's pregnant.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.711
Exactly.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.513
Everybody loves a wedding.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.648
I'm having a baby. I don't need
to marry another one.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.484
Mary, they already made
one giant mistake.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.085
They don't have to make another.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.321
So marrying me was a mistake.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.722
{\an1}You're honestly happy
with how your life turned out?

00:22.789 --> 00:23.723
You have no regrets?

00:23.790 --> 00:25.258
What do you want me to say?

00:25.325 --> 00:26.760
I want you to admit
that this marriage

00:26.826 --> 00:28.595
hasn't exactly been
a bed of roses.

00:28.661 --> 00:31.131
{\an3}Wake up. No marriage
is a bed of roses.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.566
{\an4}Well, then I guess
we nailed it.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.566
I guess we did.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.473
{\an3}Can you take Missy
to school today?

00:40.540 --> 00:41.641
Why? It's on your way.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.811
{\an8}I have to drop the church
bulletin off at the printer.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.080
{\an8}(scoffs softly)
Nobody reads those things.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.349
{\an8}I know we're not getting along
right now,

00:49.416 --> 00:51.284
{\an9}but when we walk
into that kitchen,

00:51.351 --> 00:53.153
{\an8}Missy and Sheldon
do not need to see us fighting.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.254
{\an8}Fine.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.355
{\an8}So, you'll take her?

00:55.422 --> 00:57.223
{\an8}Whatever you say, dear.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.291
{\an8}(groans)

01:01.594 --> 01:03.630
{\an7}Mom and Dad are still
really upset.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.465
{\an8}With good reason.
She's awfully old

01:05.532 --> 01:06.566
{\an8}to be having a baby.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.268
{\an8}Is it really dangerous?

01:08.334 --> 01:11.070
{\an8}Not with modern science,
but back in pioneer times,

01:11.137 --> 01:13.506
{\an8}we'd be burying her
down by the crick.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.707
{\an8}I'm just saying
they're cranky enough,

01:14.774 --> 01:16.443
{\an8}so don't be a pain in the ass.

01:16.509 --> 01:17.677
{\an8}I'm always on my best behavior.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.113
{\an8}You're the hormonal firecracker
around here.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.114
{\an8}Sheldon.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.849
{\an8}And thar she blows.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.085
{\an8}<i>Moby Dick.</i>

01:27.187 --> 01:28.688
{\an8}It's a book.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.858
{\an7}Where the hell's
my travel mug?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.728
{\an8}I think Georgie took it, dear.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.131
{\an8}That son of a gun.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.667
{\an8}Missy, your father's
gonna take you to school today.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.136
{\an8}Thanks, Daddy. I hope
it's not too much trouble.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.772
{\an8}No trouble at all,
my little angel.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.678
{\an8}Why'd you say they're cranky?

01:51.744 --> 01:53.480
{\an8}They're fine.

{\an8}Okay, you can do this.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.540
{\an8}Just tell him.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.810
{\an7}(exhales)

02:28.648 --> 02:30.717
{\an8}(sighs)

02:28.648 --> 02:30.717
{\an8}Everything okay?

02:30.783 --> 02:33.253
{\an8}Oh! What? Yes.
What are you doing there?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.522
{\an8}I came for the stapler
but stayed for the show.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.690
{\an8}Oh. Well, I was just going in

02:37.757 --> 02:39.726
{\an8}to talk to Pastor Jeff.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.726
{\an9}Hmm.

02:40.793 --> 02:41.794
{\an8}Then go.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.596
{\an8}I'm going.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.596
{\an8}Do it.

02:43.663 --> 02:44.931
{\an8}I'm doing it.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.600
{\an8}See?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.402
{\an8}Very convincing.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.670
{\an8}JEFF:
Come in.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.339
{\an8}(door closes)

02:51.671 --> 02:53.339
{\an8}What's up?

02:53.406 --> 02:56.342
{\an9}I was hoping to get
your take on something.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.544
{\an7}Of course.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.546
{\an8}Um...

02:59.612 --> 03:01.714
{\an8}This isn't really about me,

03:01.781 --> 03:04.551
{\an8}but I recently met a young woman

03:04.617 --> 03:07.720
{\an8}who got pregnant, um...

03:07.787 --> 03:09.622
{\an8}out of wedlock.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.690
{\an8}I see.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.425
{\an8}Is the young man in the picture?

03:12.492 --> 03:13.560
{\an8}He is.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.228
{\an8}Well, as long as
they tie the knot

03:15.295 --> 03:17.797
{\an8}before the bambino pops out,
the big guy looks the other way.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.499
{\an8}Right, right.

03:19.566 --> 03:23.536
{\an9}But the woman isn't
so keen on...

03:23.603 --> 03:25.905
{\an8}knots or tying them.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.607
{\an8}Then I'm afraid
she and that poor baby

03:27.674 --> 03:29.242
{\an8}are in for a difficult time.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.578
{\an8}I know. Um...

03:33.846 --> 03:37.717
{\an8}What about the parents
of the young couple?

03:37.784 --> 03:39.519
{\an8}Well, they certainly
didn't raise these kids

03:39.586 --> 03:40.653
{\an8}with the right values.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.322
{\an8}I only get them one day a week.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.324
{\an8}The rest of it's on Mom and Dad.

03:45.358 --> 03:48.394
{\an8}(chuckles):
Right. Right.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.996
{\an8}Um...

03:51.464 --> 03:54.233
{\an8}Oh. But, um...

03:54.300 --> 03:57.470
{\an8}what if the boy's parents

03:57.537 --> 03:59.806
{\an8}did want to do the right thing?

03:59.872 --> 04:02.675
I don't see
how it's their fault.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.244
Well, didn't the boy
still have premarital sex

04:05.311 --> 04:06.446
which led to pregnancy?

04:06.512 --> 04:08.314
(exhales)
Yes.

04:08.381 --> 04:09.415
You have to ask,

04:09.482 --> 04:11.584
where were his parents?

04:11.651 --> 04:13.653
Mm-hmm.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.024
These are all good questions.
(chuckles)

04:18.091 --> 04:19.959
{\an5}Okay, let's take a look
at the board now, Judy, Lisa,

04:20.026 --> 04:21.427
{\an5}and see what subjects
we're dealing with

04:21.494 --> 04:22.462
in this match of <i> Tic-Tac-Dough.</i>

04:22.528 --> 04:23.630
Famous Blondes,

04:23.696 --> 04:25.298
{\an5}Trivia Dare, Explorers...

04:23.696 --> 04:25.298
(knock on door)

04:25.365 --> 04:27.433
{\an5}...Colors, Geology,
Top Ten, Movies...

04:27.500 --> 04:29.369
I'll be right back, Wink.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.639
{\an5}What?

04:30.770 --> 04:32.639
We know what's going on at home.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.574
And we need to talk.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.509
I'm in the middle
of something important.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.411
{\an1}So are we.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.649
Um, may I please come in?

04:47.053 --> 04:48.988
{\an5}...thousand eight hundred...

04:47.053 --> 04:48.988
(TV turns off)

04:49.055 --> 04:49.989
What's up?

04:50.056 --> 04:52.492
Why won't Mom and Dad
tell us what's going on?

04:52.558 --> 04:54.527
{\an1}Well, there might be
several reasons for that,

04:54.594 --> 04:57.030
{\an1}but right off the top
of my head, I'd say

04:57.096 --> 04:58.798
none of your damn business.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.000
Mom's having a baby,
and that's none of our business?

05:01.067 --> 05:03.369
(chuckles) Is that
what you think's going on?

05:03.436 --> 05:04.771
{\an5}Isn't it?

05:03.436 --> 05:04.771
No.

05:04.837 --> 05:06.406
Then what's going on?

05:06.472 --> 05:08.374
None of your damn business.

05:09.676 --> 05:10.677
(TV playing indistinctly)

05:10.743 --> 05:12.378
We need to talk.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.546
Kind of busy.

05:13.613 --> 05:14.881
This is important.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.616
I was talking
to Pastor Jeff

05:16.683 --> 05:19.619
{\an3}about our...
little situation.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.088
{\an5}Why would you tell him?

05:19.686 --> 05:22.088
{\an3}He doesn't know
it's Georgie.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.357
But people are gonna
find out eventually,

05:24.424 --> 05:26.826
and they're gonna
judge all of us.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.695
Who cares what people think?

05:28.761 --> 05:30.897
I care. We live in this town.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.732
{\an5}I work at the church.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.732
(phone rings)

05:33.733 --> 05:35.902
(exhales)
Hello?

05:35.968 --> 05:37.837
Heads up.
The twins were just here,

05:37.904 --> 05:39.772
and they were asking
a bunch of questions.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.374
You didn't tell them, did you?

05:41.441 --> 05:43.509
No, but they know
there's a baby in the mix.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.478
(chuckles): Actually,
they thought you were having it.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.546
Oh, Lord.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.815
Yeah. Anyway, they're gonna be
there any minute.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.416
Have fun.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.051
(exhales)

05:52.118 --> 05:53.386
{\an1}What now?

05:53.453 --> 05:54.620
{\an5}(door opens)

05:53.453 --> 05:54.620
{\an3}SHELDON:
We're home.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.922
{\an6}MISSY:
And we want answers.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.922
(door closes)

05:55.988 --> 05:56.989
That.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.958
In here.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.860
We want to know
what's going on.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.829
And we know it has something
to do with a baby.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.031
{\an5}And we know it's not yours.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.031
So whose is it?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.667
This is a private matter,

06:07.734 --> 06:10.103
and it does not concern you.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.806
It's Georgie.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.675
{\an5}You don't know that.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.675
It all makes sense.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.677
You were talking with him
in the garage the other night.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.812
And word on the street is
he's sexually active.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.947
{\an1}Ew.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.149
So, who's preggers?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.984
{\an5}Yes, who?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.984
All right.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.853
Family meeting now.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.155
{\an5}I'll leave you to it.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.155
George!

06:29.222 --> 06:30.723
Fudge.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.832
{\an1}Okay, yes, your...
(sighs)

06:39.899 --> 06:42.001
{\an1}Your brother's
gonna have a baby.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.537
{\an6}With whom?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.537
Her name is Mandy.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.172
Ooh, she's the one
that's older than him.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.740
How much older?

06:47.807 --> 06:48.941
That's not important.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.743
{\an5}That means a lot.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.743
{\an3}Thank you.

06:50.810 --> 06:51.778
{\an1}GEORGE SR.:
Do I really need

06:51.844 --> 06:53.079
{\an5}to be here for this?

06:51.844 --> 06:53.079
{\an1}Yes.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.080
Double fudge.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.181
Are they getting married?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.950
{\an5}We don't know,
but probably.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.950
{\an3}Mary.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.519
{\an1}(scoffs)
It would be better for them

06:59.585 --> 07:00.753
and better for the baby.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.488
{\an3}And better for you so
your church friends

07:02.555 --> 07:03.656
don't get bent
out of shape.

07:03.723 --> 07:04.891
{\an1}We'll talk
about this later.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.160
{\an3}Ooh, a subcommittee
just formed. Exciting.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.428
The important thing is,
is that you both

07:09.495 --> 07:11.430
need to keep this quiet.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.566
This is family business.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.068
I have to keep a secret?
I'm not good at those.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.905
It's not a secret.
No one's gonna ask you about it.

07:18.971 --> 07:21.507
It's just a thing
you don't need to bring up.

07:21.574 --> 07:22.508
But what if I do?

07:22.575 --> 07:23.643
What if you don't?

07:23.709 --> 07:24.644
But now it's all
I can think about.

07:24.710 --> 07:25.945
What if my mouth loses control?

07:26.012 --> 07:28.114
You're good
at keeping promises, right?

07:28.181 --> 07:30.082
{\an5}Very.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.082
Great.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.918
Then promise
you won't tell anybody.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.086
That's an interesting
work-around. However...

07:34.153 --> 07:35.922
{\an5}You're not telling anyone.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.922
Fine.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.990
(Mary exhales)

07:38.057 --> 07:39.992
I'm gonna be an aunt.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.527
That's so weird.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.930
Not as weird as
Uncle Sheldon.

07:43.996 --> 07:46.732
{\an3}(chuckles): Yeah, well,
we're gonna be grandparents.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.669
And Meemaw's gonna be
a great-grandmother.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.671
That sounds so old.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.472
Please tell her that.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.741
MEEMAW:
<i>Good night, Wade.</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:58.544
{\an3}It ain't good.
I lost all my money.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.679
Well, good for me.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.547
Yeah, yeah.

08:01.614 --> 08:02.882
(door closes)

08:04.884 --> 08:06.686
Hey, Mandy. It's me again.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.487
Just wanted to see
how you were doing.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.823
{\an3}If there's anything
you need, I'm around.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.158
Please call me back.

08:14.293 --> 08:15.962
She ducking your calls?

08:16.028 --> 08:17.730
Seems like it.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.166
Well, you understand why she
might not want to talk to you.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.634
Yes, I know.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.169
I'm trying to make up for it.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.837
This might be
one of those things

08:24.904 --> 08:26.706
you just can't make up for.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.274
Ain't fair.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.676
You better do
some growing up fast,

08:30.743 --> 08:31.978
'cause "fair" left the building

08:32.044 --> 08:34.246
the second
you yanked your pants down.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.015
Thanks for making me feel worse.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.650
{\an1}Anytime.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.285
(door closes)

08:41.520 --> 08:44.222
What is the angular momentum
of the neutron and the proton

08:44.290 --> 08:48.027
inside deuterium?

08:49.695 --> 08:51.764
No one? Really?

08:51.831 --> 08:52.865
Sheldon?

08:52.932 --> 08:54.100
Yes?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.702
What is the angular momentum
of the neutron and the proton

08:56.769 --> 08:58.004
inside deuterium?

08:58.070 --> 09:00.273
Oh, um, "L" equals zero.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.708
Close. You're missing
the four percent admixture

09:02.775 --> 09:04.043
of "L" equals two.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.312
Sorry. I'm a little distracted.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.880
It happens. Anyway...

09:07.947 --> 09:09.282
Normally,
I would have gotten that right.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.317
I have no doubt. Anyway...

09:11.384 --> 09:12.785
There are just some things
going on at home,

09:12.852 --> 09:13.953
and I'm not allowed to talk
about it.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.121
And we don't want
to hear about it.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.757
I can tell you no one's sick
in case you're concerned.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.325
Anyone concerned?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.960
Show of hands.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.895
No? Moving on.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.931
That's why
I got the answer wrong.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.299
Son, it's just a mistake.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.767
Everyone makes them.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.770
{\an5}SHELDON:
<i>Like my brother Georgie did</i>
<i>when he got that girl pregnant.</i>

09:30.836 --> 09:33.205
<i>Don't say it.</i>
<i>Don't say it. Don't say it.</i>

09:34.273 --> 09:35.641
What?

09:35.708 --> 09:36.909
I need to use the restroom.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.744
This is college. Just go.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.516
{\an5}(door opens)

09:41.047 --> 09:43.516
You, red shirt. Lock the door.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.052
(hums)

09:46.118 --> 09:47.053
Knock, knock.

09:47.119 --> 09:48.220
Oh, hi.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.622
Just thought I'd show you

09:49.689 --> 09:51.324
how to do it on the first try.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.658
(chuckles softly)

09:53.659 --> 09:55.194
You all right?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.896
Um... Yeah.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.833
{\an5}Just, you know, life.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.833
{\an1}Mm.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.335
I've heard that can be rough.

10:02.401 --> 10:03.736
Mm.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.173
Well,
if you ever want to talk or...

10:07.239 --> 10:09.842
grab a smoke,

10:09.909 --> 10:11.344
I'm around.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.112
I'm good, thanks.

10:13.179 --> 10:16.048
{\an3}(chuckles)
Although, um...

10:17.083 --> 10:19.952
A cigarette doesn't sound bad.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.354
I was hoping
someone would help me

10:21.420 --> 10:22.855
get to the end of this pack.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.924
{\an5}Then we're quitting.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.924
Absolutely.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.692
{\an5}It's a disgusting habit.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.692
{\an1}Filthy.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.965
{\an3}You are never gonna
believe what I just heard.

10:33.032 --> 10:33.966
{\an5}Try me.

10:33.032 --> 10:33.966
(door closes)

10:34.033 --> 10:35.034
Roy and the boosters

10:35.101 --> 10:37.303
{\an3}were wining and dining
that coach from Carthage.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.741
I don't even care anymore.
He can have my job.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.243
Well, if you don't care,
why can't I have it?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.045
Fine, take it.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.714
Are you okay?

10:48.781 --> 10:50.016
Oh, jim-dandy.

10:50.082 --> 10:51.183
Is this one of those times
where you say

10:51.250 --> 10:52.318
you don't want to talk about it,

10:52.385 --> 10:53.786
and then you make me go
to the bar,

10:53.853 --> 10:54.787
and then you talk about it?

10:54.854 --> 10:55.855
No.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.089
All right.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.258
I'm gonna tell you something.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.259
Lay it on me.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.094
This is serious.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.429
You can't tell anyone.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.031
Okay.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.301
Georgie got a girl pregnant.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.670
Wow.

11:11.737 --> 11:12.805
{\an3}Oh.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.273
Congratulations?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.409
On having a dope for a son?
Thanks.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.010
Forgive me if I'm mistaken,

11:18.077 --> 11:20.146
but weren't you a similar kind
of dope with Mary?

11:20.212 --> 11:21.981
It's different.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.350
Georgie's, like,
11 years younger than this girl.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.719
That is different.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.355
We're gonna need
a couple shots over here.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.763
Sorry again
for being distracted earlier.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.298
And I'm so sorry
you got locked out.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.367
I don't know how that happened.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.770
My brother got a girl pregnant.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.905
My mom wanted me to promise

11:45.971 --> 11:47.173
I wouldn't tell,
but I never did,

11:47.239 --> 11:48.474
so technically,
I'm not breaking my word.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.975
I don't care.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.477
Thank you. But it's a secret,

11:51.544 --> 11:52.978
so please don't tell anyone.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.648
{\an5}Don't you have somewhere to go?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.648
No.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.854
{\an1}Can I tell you something
in confidence?

12:01.921 --> 12:03.255
Of course.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.291
Um,

12:05.357 --> 12:06.826
my son...

12:08.094 --> 12:09.795
...got a girl pregnant.

12:09.862 --> 12:12.465
{\an3}Whoa.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.867
{\an3}Safe to assume this
was a surprise?

12:14.934 --> 12:16.068
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.137
And safe to assume
it's not Sheldon?

12:18.204 --> 12:19.338
(laughs)

12:19.405 --> 12:21.073
Also yes.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.875
Now my mom
wants them to get married,

12:22.942 --> 12:24.810
but it doesn't sound
like the girl's willing.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.880
{\an5}Why are you still talking to me?

12:24.877 --> 12:27.880
You and I just click.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.754
{\an3}So, how are you doing
with all this?

12:35.821 --> 12:36.856
{\an1}Oh.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.824
Disappointed.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.759
Angry, upset, scared.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.528
So all the emotions. Got it.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.929
And I'm worried

12:43.996 --> 12:45.865
that if he doesn't marry
this girl,

12:45.931 --> 12:48.267
the congregation's
gonna turn on me.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.768
{\an3}They might.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.404
{\an4}(exhales)

12:49.835 --> 12:52.404
{\an3}But that's putting
man before God.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.273
{\an5}What do you mean?

12:52.471 --> 12:54.273
Well, you're caring more

12:54.340 --> 12:55.875
about what people think
than what God thinks.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.010
I'm not caring more.

12:58.077 --> 13:02.181
I just don't have to bump
into God at the grocery store.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.916
{\an3}I don't think he does
his own shopping.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.451
(chuckles)

13:05.518 --> 13:07.386
Well, at this point,
it doesn't matter,

13:07.453 --> 13:09.555
because she doesn't want
to get married.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.790
{\an5}Well, I can talk to her
if you want.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.790
{\an1}Mm.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.359
I'm pretty good
with young people.

13:13.425 --> 13:14.927
She's 29.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.564
Also pretty good
with people my own age.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.399
(chuckles)

13:21.901 --> 13:23.435
Let's say grace.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.973
Bless us, Lord, for the food
we are about to receive,

13:28.040 --> 13:29.575
and bless the hands
that prepared it. Amen.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.976
ALL:
Amen.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.946
I told Dr. Linkletter
about Georgie.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.315
Why'd y'all tell Sheldon?

13:36.382 --> 13:38.951
They didn't. I figured it out.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.053
Great. Now everyone knows.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.321
Not everyone.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.123
Just us and Dr. Linkletter.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.224
So, that's it?

13:45.291 --> 13:47.927
{\an5}Nobody else said anything?

13:45.291 --> 13:47.927
Mm.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.461
Good. 'Cause her parents

13:49.528 --> 13:51.063
still don't know,
and if this gets out,

13:51.130 --> 13:52.531
she's gonna be more pissed
than ever.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.166
Everything's gonna be fine.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.834
Let's just eat.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.507
I kind of told Heather M.
at school.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.077
I told her to keep it a secret.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.512
Did you keep it a secret?

14:06.579 --> 14:07.880
No.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.448
Unbelievable.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.420
Actually,
I told someone at church today.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.422
And I might have told Wayne.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.290
I can't believe y'all.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.961
{\an3}I know. You'd expect it from me,
but from them, it's a shocker.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.963
I ain't hungry.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.103
(door closes)

14:31.170 --> 14:33.205
So, if you haven't told
your parents yet,

14:33.272 --> 14:34.240
you might want to,

14:34.306 --> 14:37.943
'cause my family blabbed,
and it's out there.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.213
I know. I know you're angry.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.948
I'm angry, too.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.017
Please don't hang up.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.823
{\an5}(knock on door)

14:49.054 --> 14:50.823
Come in.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.128
{\an5}Hey.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.128
Hey.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.330
Just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.299
Forget it.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.201
You have so much to
deal with right now,

15:02.268 --> 15:03.469
and I made it worse.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.071
People are gonna find out
eventually.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.376
Do you think
you're gonna get married?

15:10.442 --> 15:12.211
It ain't looking good.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.179
Do you even want to?

15:14.246 --> 15:16.015
Well, I do like her.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.549
{\an1}And I'm trying to do
the right thing.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.119
Whatever that is.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.490
{\an3}Can't believe you're
gonna be a dad.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.191
Join the club.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.459
Is it weird?

15:27.526 --> 15:30.029
M-More terrifying than weird.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.297
{\an3}Yeah?

15:31.363 --> 15:33.299
I don't know what I'm doing.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.167
What if I mess this kid up?

15:35.234 --> 15:36.435
You won't.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.604
{\an1}You sure?
I'm a high school dropout

15:38.671 --> 15:40.372
{\an1}living out
in his parents' garage.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.310
{\an1}(voice breaking): Mandy's right
to not want me around.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.011
{\an3}(crying):
No, she's not.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.646
She'd be lucky to have you.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.183
So will the baby.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.118
Don't make me cry more.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.321
{\an3}Sorry.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.655
That's the last nice thing

15:56.722 --> 15:58.324
I'll ever say to you.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.629
{\an1}Hey, what did Wayne say
when you told him?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.297
He loves babies, so he was all,

16:05.364 --> 16:07.299
"It's a blessing."
Blah, blah, blah.

16:07.366 --> 16:08.734
Well, he's not wrong.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.270
Why am I friends with him?
You should be.

{\an5}(chuckles)

16:11.337 --> 16:13.072
(beer bottle opens)

16:13.138 --> 16:15.074
How'd Pastor Jeff take it?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.109
I didn't tell him.
I told Pastor Rob.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.243
Of course.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.113
{\an5}What's that mean?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.113
{\an3}Nothing.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.681
{\an1}What?

16:22.748 --> 16:25.484
Just seems like you talk
to Pastor Rob a lot.

16:25.551 --> 16:29.221
(scoffs, chuckles):
Well, we work together.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.023
You talk to Wayne.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.759
Sure.
And what did Pastor Rob say?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.394
Actually, it was helpful.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.496
He pointed out

16:37.563 --> 16:40.699
that I was putting people
before God

16:40.766 --> 16:44.236
and that I shouldn't worry about
what the congregation thinks.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.637
So, exactly what I said.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.639
All you said was, "Who cares?"

16:47.706 --> 16:50.109
Next time, I'll stick God
in there so you pay attention.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.777
Hey.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.712
{\an5}(door closes)

16:51.844 --> 16:53.712
Where were you?

16:53.779 --> 16:56.048
{\an5}Talking to Georgie.

16:53.779 --> 16:56.048
He okay?

16:56.115 --> 16:58.517
We laughed, we cried.
It was nice.
