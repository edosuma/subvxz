WEBVTT

00:08.876 --> 00:11.791
The tea? Cinnamon.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.710
The girl? Late.

00:13.712 --> 00:15.031
Twenty three minutes late.

00:15.032 --> 00:16.551
Two more minutes and I'm
leaving.

00:21.032 --> 00:23.632
They were always nervous.

00:23.633 --> 00:24.993
Which was expected.

00:27.473 --> 00:28.953
I knew what I looked like.

00:30.953 --> 00:34.073
Chiseled? Check.

00:36.473 --> 00:38.672
Caramel-blond
hair that somehow manages

00:38.673 --> 00:42.272
to look wavy and thick
all the damn time?

00:42.273 --> 00:44.193
Check.

00:44.194 --> 00:45.994
Sexy crooked smile?

00:47.754 --> 00:48.754
Check.

00:51.074 --> 00:53.633
And don't even get me
started on penis size.

00:53.634 --> 00:56.394
It just gets better
the farther south you go.

00:59.474 --> 01:01.034
Trust me.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.475
Stand.

01:11.075 --> 01:14.154
Or sit. But I doubt that's the
way to get on the good side of

01:14.155 --> 01:16.194
that barista you've been trying
not to check out

01:16.195 --> 01:17.914
since you walked in that door.

01:17.915 --> 01:19.074
SHELL I haven't...

01:19.075 --> 01:23.595
Jealousy is a crucial emotion
men feel before falling in love.

01:26.916 --> 01:28.236
I won't bite.

01:31.276 --> 01:32.836
Yet.

01:33.996 --> 01:35.076
Take it.

01:38.036 --> 01:39.195
I hate tea.

01:39.196 --> 01:40.876
No. You love tea.

01:44.876 --> 01:46.997
- Smile.
- What?

01:48.277 --> 01:51.116
Hey... you, uh... guys need
anything?

01:51.117 --> 01:52.756
I'll send my girlfriend over

01:52.757 --> 01:54.277
if we need something,
how's that?

01:57.837 --> 01:58.837
Thanks though.

02:05.357 --> 02:07.317
Stop fidgeting and sit up
straight.

02:07.318 --> 02:11.637
Sorry. It's just that he's only
talked to me twice, and

02:11.638 --> 02:14.358
only ever to ask if I wanted
sugar in my coffee.

02:15.238 --> 02:16.318
He hates coffee.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.238 --> 02:27.319
Touch me.

02:30.719 --> 02:32.758
Lower.

02:32.759 --> 02:34.599
Stop staring, or we're done.

02:36.599 --> 02:37.599
Now laugh.

02:41.759 --> 02:44.318
That'll do too.

02:44.319 --> 02:49.879
Shell, if you need anything,
let me know. Okay?

02:49.880 --> 02:52.759
I think I'm good with my tea.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.399
You hate tea.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.520
No. She loves tea.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
Asshole.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.279
He knows my name.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.599
Who are you?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.360
Ian Hunter. Master wingman

03:09.361 --> 03:11.001
and your only chance in hell
of getting...

03:11.961 --> 03:13.080
that.

03:13.081 --> 03:14.521
Here you go. Appreciate it.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.721
When do we start?

03:19.241 --> 03:20.761
Three minutes ago.

03:48.882 --> 03:50.121
{\An8}How was she?

03:50.122 --> 03:51.083
{\An8}Because if she's not a good fit,
I have another girl

03:51.084 --> 03:52.522
{\an8}that offered to pay me
in sexual favors

03:52.523 --> 03:54.242
{\an8}to move her to the top.

03:54.243 --> 03:57.082
{\An8}No, cross her off. If she knows
how to give favors,

03:57.083 --> 03:58.722
{\an8}she knows how to
get her own damn man.

03:58.723 --> 03:59.683
Noted.

03:59.684 --> 04:02.082
{\An8}And Gabi says if you
don't make it tonight for dinner

04:02.083 --> 04:04.682
{\an8}she's going to glue your hand
to your penis.

04:04.683 --> 04:06.482
{\An8}Though she was much
more graphic.

04:06.483 --> 04:09.282
{\An8}Always is. I'm on my way.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.762
{\An8}See you there.

04:10.763 --> 04:12.843
{\An8}

04:12.844 --> 04:15.323
I didn't pick this life. It's
not like I woke up one morning

04:15.324 --> 04:18.243
and went, "Whoa, wouldn't
it be so badass

04:18.244 --> 04:19.803
to help women get the guy.

04:19.803 --> 04:23.523
{\An8} I'm a coach. And coaches
have their playbooks,

04:23.524 --> 04:25.843
{\an8} it's not enough to know
how to play the game,

04:25.844 --> 04:28.363
you have to know
how to read the plays,

04:28.364 --> 04:29.723
know your opponent.

04:29.724 --> 04:31.643
That's what Wingmen, Inc.
Is about.

04:31.644 --> 04:34.004
Who better to teach women
how not to get played

04:34.005 --> 04:36.204
than the actual player?

04:36.205 --> 04:37.724
To what do I owe this pleasure?

04:37.725 --> 04:38.964
I'm not your client, Ian.

04:38.965 --> 04:40.684
Cut with the smooth-talking
love coach voice.

04:40.685 --> 04:42.325
You promised!

04:43.325 --> 04:44.884
I did.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.644
You forgot, didn't you?

04:46.645 --> 04:48.484
Of course not. Come on.

04:48.485 --> 04:49.884
Sometimes I wonder
why we're friends.

04:49.885 --> 04:51.324
Because you like watching me
while I sleep?

04:51.325 --> 04:53.285
One time, Ian!

04:53.286 --> 04:54.965
The welcome party
for my two new roommates?

04:54.966 --> 04:56.285
You were supposed to bring the
chips and dip?

04:56.286 --> 04:59.965
I'm sorry, Gabs. I'll be there
in fifteen minutes.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.885
You better.

05:16.247 --> 05:19.807
Wow. Your top looks gorgeous
with your skin tone.

05:22.607 --> 05:25.007
Sometimes it was just too easy.

05:29.847 --> 05:31.486
You said fifteen minutes.

05:31.487 --> 05:33.486
Did I say fifteen? Could have
sworn I said twenty.

05:33.487 --> 05:35.287
You smell like cheap perfume.

05:35.288 --> 05:36.687
Seriously, you smell bad, dude.

05:36.688 --> 05:39.367
Go. Shower. I'll put out
the food.

05:39.368 --> 05:40.288
Your extra clothes
are still in my room.

05:40.289 --> 05:42.727
Just... Get rid of the skank.

05:42.728 --> 05:43.967
She has a name, you know.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.487
Although, I really couldn't
read her nametag

05:45.488 --> 05:46.767
with her lips wrapped around me,

05:46.768 --> 05:47.768
she was blocking the view.

05:47.769 --> 05:49.687
One day you're going to get
smited.

05:49.688 --> 05:50.767
Or is it smote?

05:50.768 --> 05:52.608
That sounds dirty.
Can't wait to try that.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.088
Lex.

06:28.690 --> 06:31.090
Kinda had you pegged for a
boyshorts girl.

06:33.930 --> 06:35.809
What are you doing in my room?

06:35.810 --> 06:37.570
You mean Gabi's room.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.330
I mean my room.

06:39.331 --> 06:40.571
And you are?

06:41.891 --> 06:43.130
Look, I've got about
three minutes

06:43.131 --> 06:44.330
before Gabi hands me my ass.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.610
Did you want to go on the bed

06:46.611 --> 06:48.330
or the floor, since you're
already there?

06:48.331 --> 06:50.570
What are you talking about?

06:50.571 --> 06:52.010
Down to about two minutes.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.410
I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna
be a little difficult,

06:53.411 --> 06:56.250
but I could probably conjure
something up that would cause

06:56.251 --> 06:58.331
a little panting.
Maybe a scream or two.

06:58.332 --> 06:59.971
A scream?

06:59.972 --> 07:01.972
Are you a stripper for
the party?

07:02.732 --> 07:03.732
No.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.091
Come on. About ten seconds
left,

07:06.092 --> 07:08.491
and I don't even think I can
perform miracles of this...

07:08.492 --> 07:11.411
- caliber.
- Get out of my room.

07:11.412 --> 07:12.491
You mean Gabi's room.

07:12.492 --> 07:13.651
We switched.

07:13.652 --> 07:15.571
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:15.572 --> 07:18.893
Okay, so... That would make
Gabi's room...?

07:20.093 --> 07:21.372
Yeah.

07:21.373 --> 07:22.932
Gotcha.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.932
Your loss. Could have
rocked your world.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.733
My world doesn't need rocking.

07:28.773 --> 07:30.692
Every girl needs to allow her
world to be rocked,

07:30.693 --> 07:33.172
at least once.

07:33.173 --> 07:35.613
Or, if said rocking is
coming from moi?

07:36.253 --> 07:37.493
Sometimes twice.

07:41.254 --> 07:43.093
It's a little more complicated
than that.

07:43.094 --> 07:45.934
It's not just ones and zeroes.

07:48.614 --> 07:50.054
That's amazing.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.814
It's been ten minutes,
tell me you didn't...

07:56.694 --> 07:57.614
Didn't? What?

07:57.615 --> 07:59.413
- What was that for?
- Where's Blake?

07:59.414 --> 08:01.734
- Is she on the basketball team?
- No. Where is she?

08:01.735 --> 08:03.254
- Soccer? Tennis?
- No. Ian...

08:03.255 --> 08:05.014
if you touched her, I
swear I'll rip your golden locks

08:05.015 --> 08:06.574
from your brain one by one.

08:06.575 --> 08:09.494
- Golf?
- Volleyball, actually.

08:09.495 --> 08:10.814
That explains the clothes.

08:10.815 --> 08:12.135
What's wrong with my clothes?

08:16.055 --> 08:16.935
He belong to you?

08:16.936 --> 08:18.534
Unfortunately.

08:18.535 --> 08:20.694
You know how your parents always
tell you not to feed strays?

08:20.695 --> 08:23.335
He was so cute at
first, like all puppies.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.055
Then he started biting
all my friends.

08:25.056 --> 08:26.576
Love you too, Boo.

08:28.497 --> 08:31.655
Are we going to do this or what?
I have a test in the morning.

08:31.656 --> 08:33.135
Not yet! It's a welcome party

08:33.135 --> 08:34.695
for my new roommates Serena
and Blake.

08:34.696 --> 08:36.135
We have to socialize first.

08:36.135 --> 08:37.575
Come on, Gabs. We met the
roomates,

08:37.576 --> 08:40.015
Ian brought food, and
you're still single.

08:40.015 --> 08:42.097
I mean, all is right
with the world.

08:44.217 --> 08:47.176
Calm down. Come here, sit.

08:47.177 --> 08:53.057
Let's just watch the show,
and then we'll have dessert.

08:54.537 --> 08:56.897
Should have never fed him
that first treat.

08:57.857 --> 08:59.736
Haunts me day and night, Blake,

08:59.737 --> 09:01.617
day and night.

09:10.498 --> 09:12.097
What's up, my man?

09:12.098 --> 09:12.898
What's the news?

09:12.899 --> 09:14.697
- Serena.
- Okay.

09:14.698 --> 09:17.378
Wildcat in bed.
Forgot my name twice.

09:18.498 --> 09:21.217
Asked if I believed in unicorns.

09:21.218 --> 09:22.817
Has attended Comic Con three
times.

09:22.818 --> 09:24.538
When I asked for her number...

09:24.539 --> 09:26.058
she cried.

09:26.059 --> 09:27.659
Cried?

09:28.579 --> 09:29.139
Damn.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.138
Must have been on your "A" game
last night.

09:31.139 --> 09:33.298
I'm never off my game.

09:33.299 --> 09:36.419
So that one time you hit
on Gabi was a fluke?

09:37.019 --> 09:37.979
I was drunk.

09:37.980 --> 09:39.978
Can we not talk about Gabi
this early in the morning?

09:39.979 --> 09:41.699
It really messes with
the rest of my day.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.979
Hi Ian.

09:44.860 --> 09:45.899
Your schedule is full,

09:45.900 --> 09:47.539
but a new one popped up on
the site this morning,

09:47.540 --> 09:50.140
I wasn't sure if you
wanted me to let her apply.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.420
Do it.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.499
I gotta go.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.139
Shell has an early class
with Douchepants

09:56.140 --> 09:58.259
and I gotta walk her to class
holding her books,

09:58.260 --> 10:00.659
then... kiss her on the forehead.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.660
Tale as old as time, my friend.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.340
You know it.

10:10.021 --> 10:11.301
Stop here.

10:21.021 --> 10:21.981
Did he notice?

10:21.982 --> 10:23.860
Oh, he noticed.

10:23.861 --> 10:25.580
Now you can give
him your phone number.

10:25.581 --> 10:26.382
Don't answer the first text.

10:26.383 --> 10:29.221
Answer the third.
Always the third.

10:29.222 --> 10:31.141
What if he doesn't ask for it?

10:31.142 --> 10:32.102
Trust me, he will.

10:32.103 --> 10:33.782
Now off you go.

10:37.822 --> 10:41.501
I just blazed through rules
one, two, three and four.

10:41.502 --> 10:43.421
Make them curious.

10:43.422 --> 10:46.141
Don't appear
too interested.

10:46.142 --> 10:49.142
Give them
a method of contact,

10:49.143 --> 10:50.702
but keep the ball in your court.

10:50.703 --> 10:54.423
Never answer
the first text.

10:59.263 --> 11:00.343
Sorry, bro.

11:01.743 --> 11:02.743
You.

11:05.503 --> 11:06.823
Hi.

11:07.704 --> 11:09.263
Fans of yours?

11:09.264 --> 11:11.183
Maybe he'll sit with us.

11:11.184 --> 11:12.223
The club has an opening.

11:12.224 --> 11:15.503
They made posters last year.

11:15.504 --> 11:17.983
You clearly have too high
of an opinion of yourself.

11:17.984 --> 11:19.824
Some may say not high enough.

11:38.345 --> 11:40.104
Are you going to make it?

11:40.105 --> 11:41.985
Are you gonna make it?

11:48.745 --> 11:49.826
Blue.

11:50.306 --> 11:51.345
What?

11:51.346 --> 11:54.225
You're eyes.
They're a nice ice blue.

11:54.226 --> 11:56.745
I'm not interested.

11:56.746 --> 12:00.025
- In men?
- In you. So stop talking.

12:00.026 --> 12:01.026
Thank you.

12:01.027 --> 12:04.305
Open your books for those
who brought them,

12:04.306 --> 12:06.426
to page 34.

12:13.348 --> 12:14.386
And just a reminder,

12:14.387 --> 12:18.066
there will be a quiz on Chapter
four next week.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.547
- Thank you.
- Blake...

12:27.267 --> 12:28.346
It worked!

12:28.347 --> 12:29.107
Of course it did.

12:29.108 --> 12:30.426
He's going to
try to get you alone.

12:30.427 --> 12:31.827
Don't let him.

12:31.828 --> 12:34.387
- But...
- Rule number five. You're busy.

12:34.388 --> 12:36.587
You're always busy
unless I say you aren't.

12:36.588 --> 12:39.068
Ian, you're the best.

12:45.748 --> 12:47.388
Interesting.

12:54.509 --> 12:55.708
Waiting for someone?

12:55.709 --> 12:59.229
Yes I am. It's very important,
can you please leave?

13:02.189 --> 13:04.188
Forget it. This was
a stupid idea.

13:04.189 --> 13:07.708
I doubt David would
approve of that attitude?

13:07.709 --> 13:10.109
Says here he values optimism
above all things.

13:10.989 --> 13:12.229
What?

13:15.350 --> 13:17.110
Come with me. Let's go.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.629
What is this?

13:25.630 --> 13:27.749
Wingmen, Inc.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.789
No, no, no. You've got
to be kidding me.

13:30.790 --> 13:31.909
Not kidding you.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.029
Lex and I are the masterminds

13:33.030 --> 13:34.910
behind the fastest growing
dating service

13:34.911 --> 13:36.230
in the Pacific Northwest.

13:36.231 --> 13:37.830
Some say I'm a
modern-day Superman,

13:37.831 --> 13:39.990
saving women from themselves

13:39.991 --> 13:41.271
while Lex plays sidekick.

13:42.351 --> 13:44.190
You're welcome.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.550
You're such an ass.

13:45.551 --> 13:47.310
I'm also your new love coach.

13:47.311 --> 13:48.791
That is, if you're
still interested.

13:50.911 --> 13:53.110
Look. We have a ninety-nine
percent success rate.

13:53.111 --> 13:55.831
If you follow the rules,
take my advice and guidance,

13:55.832 --> 13:57.911
you'll be popping out little
Davids in no time.

13:57.912 --> 13:58.912
Kids?

13:58.913 --> 14:01.831
Yeah. Or whatever it is you
want.

14:01.832 --> 14:02.992
I'll get it for you.

14:06.152 --> 14:07.551
Can I think about it?

14:07.552 --> 14:09.111
Sure. You have one minute.

14:09.112 --> 14:11.831
This was an impulse.

14:11.832 --> 14:14.151
A girl on my team gave me
your card

14:14.152 --> 14:17.112
after I kept complaining
about David not noticing me...

14:17.113 --> 14:19.593
Megan. Nice girl. 30 seconds...

14:21.713 --> 14:22.633
Fine.

14:22.634 --> 14:25.192
Good. I don't like to
candycoat anything.

14:25.193 --> 14:26.592
So, I'm gonna
be real honest here.

14:26.593 --> 14:29.672
If we're gonna turn the head of the captain of the basketball team,

14:29.673 --> 14:32.712
we've got a lot of work to do.

14:32.713 --> 14:35.713
But I'm the best.
We start tonight.

14:35.714 --> 14:37.433
Lex is going to look over
the details,

14:37.434 --> 14:39.993
and send you the schedule
tonight. Okay?

14:39.994 --> 14:42.953
And if David reaches out at
all during this process,

14:42.954 --> 14:44.393
contact me first.

14:44.394 --> 14:46.433
If he texts you today, ignore
him.

14:46.434 --> 14:50.033
If he calls you, you're busy
with your new study partner.

14:50.034 --> 14:51.594
Is that you?

14:53.754 --> 14:55.393
Blake, not only am I your
new study partner.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.675
From here on out...
I'm your everything.

15:00.795 --> 15:03.114
I know you pride yourself
in taking less than a week for a

15:03.115 --> 15:08.034
client to gain true love's kiss,
but damn...

15:08.035 --> 15:09.154
It can't be that bad.

15:09.155 --> 15:10.194
No. Actually, it's worse.

15:10.195 --> 15:13.874
You mean she's a little virgin
who's never kissed a man,

15:13.875 --> 15:15.234
blushes when she hears the word
sex,

15:15.235 --> 15:16.714
can't spell the word "orgasm",

15:16.715 --> 15:19.156
and believes in love
at first sight?

15:21.356 --> 15:23.035
Damn.

15:23.036 --> 15:24.155
Here's her questionaire.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.035
Check out Blake's
number fifteen.

15:26.036 --> 15:28.315
Number 15? Oh yeah.

15:28.316 --> 15:31.115
"What would you wear on
a first date?"

15:31.116 --> 15:33.155
"Something comfortable

15:33.156 --> 15:35.115
like a baggy sweatshirt? Or...

15:35.116 --> 15:38.197
a hat, because hats
are mysterious."

15:39.637 --> 15:41.676
Number sixteen's my favorite.

15:41.677 --> 15:43.356
"My first kiss was..."

15:43.357 --> 15:46.357
Her answer, "Hopefully it will
be great."

15:48.157 --> 15:50.837
I especially liked the smiley
face and the heart emoji.

15:52.597 --> 15:54.156
I'm going to see her tonight,
so I'll follow up on these.

15:54.157 --> 15:56.236
Did you want to finish the
questionnaire, or should I?

15:56.237 --> 15:57.997
No. That's all you, bro.

16:01.678 --> 16:04.397
Just... no.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.838
Yeah, no.

16:10.798 --> 16:12.158
Hi, Ian.

16:14.318 --> 16:16.437
He's so hot.

16:16.438 --> 16:18.357
How can you do that?

16:18.358 --> 16:21.838
Lead girls on like that?

16:21.839 --> 16:24.599
Every single one of them is
still staring and whispering.

16:25.559 --> 16:28.438
One of them just took a picture.

16:28.439 --> 16:29.559
Two, actually.

16:30.879 --> 16:34.319
Why? It's not like you're
famous or anything.

16:37.279 --> 16:38.719
Are you?

16:40.079 --> 16:42.399
Was.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.599
Are you going to just leave it
like that?

16:44.600 --> 16:48.200
Or do you want to explain?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.159
There's not much to explain.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.959
My sophomore year, I got an
exemption to play pro football,

16:54.960 --> 16:58.760
and then... I got injured.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.160
So, here I am.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.640
Whoa. What just happened
here?

17:08.641 --> 17:10.440
That was
a good practice, guys.

17:10.441 --> 17:11.560
Let's take the spot here.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.601
He's here.

17:14.521 --> 17:16.001
Yeah, I know.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.240
That's why we're here.

17:18.241 --> 17:22.521
He comes here every night
after basketball practice.

17:22.521 --> 17:24.201
We're doing a little recon.

17:24.202 --> 17:27.401
Your file shows that you met
when you were four.

17:27.402 --> 17:31.162
And you guys actually
took baths together.

17:32.762 --> 17:34.881
So, I'm just wondering what this
whole shy deal is about.

17:34.882 --> 17:38.122
'Cause, he's seen the goods,
sister.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.801
The goods?

17:40.802 --> 17:43.002
I didn't have goods
when I was four.

17:43.003 --> 17:46.442
I can't even tell
if you have goods now.

17:46.443 --> 17:48.523
Considering the baggy clothes
you wear.

17:51.763 --> 17:55.522
Okay, can we just go
before he sees us, please?

17:55.523 --> 17:57.722
And that's a bad idea, why?

17:57.723 --> 18:01.242
Because, every time I'm around
him I act like a dude,

18:01.243 --> 18:02.642
like I'm one of the guys.

18:02.643 --> 18:07.243
I just want him to see
me differently.

18:07.244 --> 18:10.403
I want him to know I have...
boobs.

18:10.404 --> 18:12.123
Alright, well...

18:12.124 --> 18:13.683
like I said before,

18:13.684 --> 18:17.044
the jury's still clearly
out on that one.

18:24.925 --> 18:27.644
- Are you sniffing my hair?
- Yeah.

18:27.645 --> 18:30.004
Is he looking?

18:30.005 --> 18:31.364
No. He's eating.

18:31.365 --> 18:32.524
Bastard.

18:32.525 --> 18:34.084
God, he must be clueless.

18:34.085 --> 18:36.244
You know what?
He must have seen you.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.685
Come here. Turn. Look at me.

18:42.085 --> 18:43.285
What?

19:04.126 --> 19:05.405
Blake?

19:05.406 --> 19:09.526
Hey. Sorry I didn't see you
when we came in.

19:09.527 --> 19:10.767
Who's your friend?

19:11.607 --> 19:12.927
Name's Ian.

19:13.607 --> 19:15.366
Ian.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.726
Ian. How's it going, man?

19:17.727 --> 19:18.766
Good.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.446
David, you should have seen
this guy play.

19:20.447 --> 19:22.686
Let's not bore him
with that.

19:22.687 --> 19:23.846
Nice to meet you, David.

19:23.847 --> 19:25.887
How do you know my girl?

19:27.888 --> 19:29.807
Your girl?

19:29.808 --> 19:31.728
Yeah, my girl.

19:35.088 --> 19:38.888
I didn't realize you were
dating anybody.

19:40.328 --> 19:42.448
I didn't realize you were
her dad?

19:44.608 --> 19:46.367
Hell no, man!

19:46.368 --> 19:47.288
We go way back.

19:47.289 --> 19:50.369
We've been
friends since we could walk.

19:52.129 --> 19:54.048
Cute story.

19:54.049 --> 19:56.808
Well, it was nice
meeting Blake's dad.

19:56.809 --> 19:58.088
Kidding.

19:58.089 --> 19:59.688
It was nice meeting you, David.

19:59.689 --> 20:00.889
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

20:03.729 --> 20:05.408
It's good to see you, Blake.

20:05.409 --> 20:07.848
- You too.
- Shall we?

20:07.849 --> 20:09.170
Yeah.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.410
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.729
Thank you.

20:23.730 --> 20:26.169
I think that was the first time
he's ever looked at me...

20:26.170 --> 20:27.569
Like you had boobs.

20:27.570 --> 20:29.370
Exactly.

20:37.131 --> 20:38.531
Next.

20:42.331 --> 20:43.890
I'm going to count to five.

20:43.891 --> 20:45.090
I don't think it fits.

20:45.091 --> 20:47.570
They measured you.
It fits.

20:47.571 --> 20:51.091
We gotta go. Gabi said we
got dinner at six.

20:51.092 --> 20:52.451
This is too much pressure.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.211
How do I know if it fits?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.051
They're boobs. How do I know if
it looks good?

20:57.052 --> 20:58.091
Let's go.

20:58.092 --> 21:00.452
Open up before I crawl under.
Come on, let's go.

21:05.292 --> 21:08.852
Scale of one to ten?
How awful is it?

21:11.773 --> 21:14.532
Blake, you look great.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.372
You sound bored.

21:16.373 --> 21:18.813
No. Your boobs look good.

21:20.533 --> 21:22.372
Happy.

21:22.373 --> 21:23.413
You think?

21:26.213 --> 21:27.772
I'm just no good at this.

21:27.773 --> 21:30.413
I didn't grow up with a mom.
So...

21:31.813 --> 21:36.213
Well, men are turned on
by sight,

21:36.214 --> 21:37.813
girls by touch.

21:37.814 --> 21:38.853
By wearing something fitting,

21:38.854 --> 21:41.253
you're guaranteeing that
he won't see you as a buddy,

21:41.254 --> 21:44.133
but as a partner.

21:44.134 --> 21:45.734
And that's what you wanted,
right?

21:47.134 --> 21:48.574
Right.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.573
You look good.

21:50.574 --> 21:53.134
He'll be eating out of your
hand in no time.

21:53.135 --> 21:55.974
That confident in your
abilities?

21:55.975 --> 21:58.334
No. But I'm pretty confident
in yours.

21:58.335 --> 22:02.094
Sir,
you need to get out of the dressing room.

22:02.095 --> 22:03.454
We don't allow customers to...

22:03.455 --> 22:06.094
play in the product before
they purchase.

22:06.095 --> 22:09.054
- Play?
- Hanky-panky.

22:09.055 --> 22:11.174
Oh, you mean sex?

22:11.175 --> 22:12.894
Sir! Get out this instant.

22:12.895 --> 22:16.656
Stop it.

22:17.776 --> 22:18.895
Just a minute.

22:18.896 --> 22:20.276
Right now!

22:20.376 --> 22:22.455
- We're coming out.
- I'm almost there.

22:22.456 --> 22:23.815
I'm going to call security!

22:23.816 --> 22:25.376
Oh, yeah. Ouch!

22:29.536 --> 22:30.656
We'll take it all.

22:39.377 --> 22:41.017
Thank you.

22:53.537 --> 22:54.457
If you hurt her,

22:54.458 --> 22:56.299
I'm going to break off
your favorite appendage.

23:01.058 --> 23:03.217
Sorry, traffic was shit.

23:03.218 --> 23:05.658
- It usually is.
- Yeah.

23:07.698 --> 23:10.697
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:10.698 --> 23:15.057
- So where's the other roomie?
- I'm here.

23:15.058 --> 23:18.258
Are you okay?

23:18.259 --> 23:19.298
Yup.

23:19.299 --> 23:20.619
Lex.

23:27.059 --> 23:29.379
Lex.

23:30.259 --> 23:32.259
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:33.659 --> 23:36.298
So, Blake...
I like your new look.

23:36.299 --> 23:40.019
Thanks. It was Ian.
He was a big help.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.099
It's okay, I guess.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.939
I mean, if you're
into working out.

23:42.940 --> 23:45.260
Which she clearly is.
Look at her.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.699
Oh my god.

23:50.700 --> 23:54.859
- I'm so sorry. It slipped.
- It's okay.

23:54.860 --> 23:58.620
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's just workout clothes.

23:58.621 --> 24:03.660
I can always wash them.

24:03.661 --> 24:05.180
That is good.

24:05.181 --> 24:06.621
Fine. I'm fine. I'm good.

24:12.981 --> 24:14.821
Have you kissed her yet?

24:21.182 --> 24:22.862
I'll take that as a no.

24:24.462 --> 24:25.581
She's never kissed another guy.

24:25.582 --> 24:29.622
It would be... wrong.
You know that.

24:30.622 --> 24:32.822
- Wrong...
- Mm hm.

24:34.422 --> 24:36.982
Are you falling for her?

24:38.462 --> 24:41.782
No! Hell no.

24:41.783 --> 24:43.422
Have you seen
her flip-flops?

24:43.423 --> 24:45.103
Jesus.

24:46.183 --> 24:48.103
What's our main rule?

24:49.023 --> 24:50.583
Don't fall for the clients.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.422
Don't...

24:53.423 --> 24:54.782
fall...

24:54.783 --> 24:56.223
for the clients.

24:58.423 --> 24:59.903
I think it's clean, bro.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.104
No dessert?

25:07.104 --> 25:08.943
Blake, can I talk to you
for a second upstairs?

25:08.944 --> 25:10.304
Sure, yeah.

25:11.984 --> 25:13.264
Why?

25:21.025 --> 25:22.864
What's wrong?

25:24.625 --> 25:25.385
Hands up.

25:25.386 --> 25:27.545
Okay, here we go.

25:32.625 --> 25:36.704
You're... wearing a thong.
Hmm.

25:36.705 --> 25:39.465
Yeah. Does the stripping
have a purpose?

25:40.665 --> 25:42.706
Stripping should always
have a purpose.

25:43.866 --> 25:45.785
We need to wash your clothes.

25:45.786 --> 25:47.425
And I needed help with that,
or what?

25:47.426 --> 25:48.786
You have any giant hoodies
in here?

26:02.827 --> 26:03.946
Honest moment.

26:03.947 --> 26:07.746
Why do you wear
clothes like this?

26:07.747 --> 26:10.107
Well, everybody has
their own thing, right?

26:12.987 --> 26:15.226
What?

26:15.227 --> 26:17.426
Nothing. Right.

26:17.427 --> 26:21.186
Tomorrow, me and you, we're
going to work out together.

26:21.187 --> 26:22.746
We need to be at the gym
early, before David,

26:22.747 --> 26:24.227
because we're going to
catch him by surprise.

26:24.228 --> 26:25.827
Adrenaline pumps
when you workout,

26:25.828 --> 26:29.148
and if a hot chick's watching,
even better.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.947
You said hot chick. Not cute.

26:32.948 --> 26:34.147
You're hot. Trust me.

26:34.148 --> 26:37.067
Come here. So tomorrow, when he
sees us, we need to flirt.

26:37.068 --> 26:40.348
The problem is, that you flinch
when I try to touch you.

26:41.028 --> 26:43.427
No, I don't!

26:43.428 --> 26:44.629
I don't.

26:47.389 --> 26:49.388
Okay, see that?

26:49.389 --> 26:50.229
That look right there,

26:50.230 --> 26:51.748
Yeah, that really
pissed-off look.

26:51.749 --> 26:53.748
It sometimes can be
confused with lust.

26:53.749 --> 26:56.228
So maybe I'll just piss you off
the entire workout.

26:56.229 --> 26:58.428
That might work,
but if it doesn't...

26:58.429 --> 27:00.188
I may need to kiss you,

27:00.189 --> 27:01.988
Okay, and if I do,

27:01.989 --> 27:04.828
I need to know that you're not
going to scratch my eyes out,

27:04.829 --> 27:05.949
or knee me in the balls.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.989
I might.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.469
Guess you'll have to find out.

27:09.470 --> 27:13.789
No. Never play a player.

27:13.790 --> 27:17.069
It doesn't work.
Okay, sweet cheeks?

27:17.070 --> 27:18.470
Sweet cheeks?

27:22.870 --> 27:24.030
Sweet cheeks.

27:26.311 --> 27:30.831
Okay, I think lesson time
is over.

27:32.951 --> 27:35.670
I'll be back at 4:30
to pick you up.

27:35.671 --> 27:36.990
- In the morning?
- Mm hm.

27:36.991 --> 27:39.470
Oh, okay.

27:39.471 --> 27:40.550
This better work.

27:40.551 --> 27:41.231
It's never not worked.

27:41.232 --> 27:43.990
So... unless you're having
second thoughts?

27:43.991 --> 27:46.111
No! No, I'm not.

27:55.192 --> 27:58.192
Um, 4:30. Be ready.

28:07.873 --> 28:09.952
Two more!

28:09.953 --> 28:11.233
One more!

28:15.153 --> 28:16.352
You tired?

28:16.353 --> 28:19.072
Exhausted. But I love
that feeling.

28:19.073 --> 28:19.993
It's the best.

28:19.994 --> 28:21.953
- What next?
- I'll stretch you out.

28:30.914 --> 28:32.394
Let's warm up
on the bench.

28:38.714 --> 28:40.233
Stay calm. You're good.

28:40.234 --> 28:42.394
- Relax.
- Ouch.

28:43.834 --> 28:45.553
You're tight.

28:45.554 --> 28:47.114
Feels amazing.

28:51.915 --> 28:52.955
What?

28:55.235 --> 28:56.675
Blake?

28:57.355 --> 28:59.034
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

28:59.035 --> 29:01.155
Hey David, I didn't
see you there.

29:04.555 --> 29:08.394
Wow... you look...

29:08.395 --> 29:09.915
Exhausted?

29:09.916 --> 29:13.355
Ian really knows how to work me.

29:13.356 --> 29:18.035
You know, if you ever need
help at the gym...

29:18.036 --> 29:19.355
you could always ask me.

29:19.356 --> 29:21.435
Thanks for the offer, but...

29:21.436 --> 29:22.996
David, I think I've got it.

29:25.196 --> 29:26.795
Alright.

29:26.796 --> 29:29.115
The offer stands.

29:29.116 --> 29:30.636
It's really good to see you,
Blake.

29:31.557 --> 29:34.917
You look... good.

29:36.077 --> 29:37.677
Thanks.

29:46.357 --> 29:48.597
Skip the warm up.
Put another one on.

29:58.238 --> 29:59.558
Wow.

30:01.598 --> 30:03.078
Hell, no.

30:09.718 --> 30:10.998
Sorry.

30:15.559 --> 30:17.759
That was a really great
first kiss.

30:21.839 --> 30:23.678
Damn it.

30:23.679 --> 30:25.318
I was ruining everything.

30:25.319 --> 30:27.358
I was her first kiss? Me?

30:27.359 --> 30:29.118
The certified man whore?

30:29.119 --> 30:31.438
Not the man she was
in love with.

30:31.439 --> 30:33.759
Can I get you guys anything
else?

30:33.760 --> 30:36.759
I don't suppose you moonlight
as a massage therapist.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.879
Well done. The line was
delivered perfectly.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.599
No, but I am good with my hands.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.559
Doubtful, very doubtful.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.679
Great. The sooner I finished
with Shell,

30:47.680 --> 30:49.599
the sooner I could...

30:49.600 --> 30:51.919
What? Finish with Blake?

30:51.920 --> 30:53.639
Let's go, Shell.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.400
What if she doesn't want
to go with you?

30:55.401 --> 30:57.800
The last round
goes to the barista.

30:57.801 --> 30:59.161
Ian, I think you should go.

31:00.201 --> 31:02.920
If that's what you want, Shell.

31:05.001 --> 31:08.001
The last round
always goes to the guy.

31:10.041 --> 31:11.321
Blake.

31:13.241 --> 31:16.242
Gabs, Blake!

31:17.882 --> 31:18.802
There you are.

31:18.803 --> 31:21.321
Geez, some people are
trying to sleep.

31:21.322 --> 31:23.081
Aw, really?

31:23.082 --> 31:27.121
Mmmm. Cute hair.

31:27.122 --> 31:28.881
I'm sick, you ass.

31:28.882 --> 31:30.401
Really?

31:30.402 --> 31:31.761
Oh please, you're lucky you
don't have the clap

31:31.762 --> 31:33.321
from all the sex you've had.

31:33.322 --> 31:35.762
And you're afraid
of a little cold.

31:35.763 --> 31:38.082
Yeah, I don't like germs.
What do you want?

31:38.083 --> 31:39.923
Why are you here?

31:41.003 --> 31:42.602
I had an idea for Blake.

31:42.603 --> 31:44.002
She's upstairs.

31:44.003 --> 31:47.402
The pipe in the bathroom broke,
and there was water everywhere.

31:47.403 --> 31:50.042
I tried getting a plumber,
but she said something about

31:50.043 --> 31:52.322
her friend's dad
being a plumber,

31:52.323 --> 31:54.442
and suddenly some tall dude
showed up

31:54.443 --> 31:56.002
and said he could fix it.

32:01.964 --> 32:03.043
David.

32:03.044 --> 32:04.044
Who?

32:05.084 --> 32:06.204
Thank you, David.

32:07.204 --> 32:08.924
Ian.

32:09.764 --> 32:11.563
Are you sick too?

32:11.564 --> 32:13.804
- I think so.
- Yeah.

32:16.924 --> 32:19.404
Blake?

32:19.405 --> 32:21.804
I'm pretty sure he's gonna
be just fine.

32:21.805 --> 32:23.404
The last thing you need is

32:23.405 --> 32:26.564
to get sick before the big test
on Friday. Right?

32:26.565 --> 32:29.044
Would you want to get out of
here?

32:29.045 --> 32:30.324
We could get ice cream
or something?

32:30.325 --> 32:32.044
So you're not stuck in a sick
house.

32:32.045 --> 32:35.845
He's probably right.
You shouldn't get sick.

32:36.845 --> 32:38.045
You know what?

32:38.046 --> 32:40.005
You're probably already coming
down with something.

32:40.006 --> 32:42.045
I'm sorry, babe. If I had known,

32:42.046 --> 32:44.286
I wouldn't have put my mouth
all over you like that.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.725
Rain check?

32:48.726 --> 32:52.285
I don't want you to get sick
before your big game.

32:52.286 --> 32:57.045
Yeah... that's probably
a good idea.

32:57.046 --> 32:58.725
But you do have my
number now so...

32:58.726 --> 33:01.326
So, call me any time.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.286
Mm hm.

33:03.287 --> 33:05.687
- Good to see you.
- You too.

33:10.967 --> 33:13.806
Look, if he asks you
to hang out,

33:13.807 --> 33:15.086
you're busy.

33:15.087 --> 33:16.806
You're always busy
until I say you're free.

33:16.807 --> 33:19.887
Rule number five
clearly states this.

33:19.888 --> 33:21.847
If he tries to call you
or coerce you into hanging out,

33:21.848 --> 33:23.727
No.

33:23.728 --> 33:25.407
Especially when you're
with another guy.

33:25.408 --> 33:28.767
It makes you look easy and makes
our relationship look fake.

33:28.768 --> 33:31.248
- Yeah. Yep.
- Okay?

33:32.888 --> 33:34.728
Alright, um...

33:37.288 --> 33:39.288
I'll see you girls later.

33:48.689 --> 33:51.048
Lex! Emergency meeting. Now!

33:51.049 --> 33:52.448
What up?

33:52.449 --> 33:53.889
It's David.

33:54.929 --> 33:57.208
What is his deal?

33:57.209 --> 34:00.048
She's moving through these steps
way too fast,

34:00.049 --> 34:01.369
and he's falling for it.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.609
Something's up with him.

34:02.610 --> 34:04.049
Can you bring up his file?

34:04.050 --> 34:05.650
You want to look at his file?

34:09.650 --> 34:12.289
David and Blake's
compatibility...

34:12.290 --> 34:14.768
Eighty-seven percent.
Isn't that kind of high?

34:14.770 --> 34:17.129
That's high.
Really high.

34:17.130 --> 34:19.489
You like her.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.330
Yeah, I also like yogurt.

34:23.170 --> 34:25.370
Gabi called.

34:25.371 --> 34:26.449
She's worried.

34:26.451 --> 34:27.889
Gabi called?

34:27.891 --> 34:29.971
Gabi called? She hates you.

34:31.291 --> 34:33.850
Which she said at least
ten times

34:33.851 --> 34:35.969
before finally getting to
the reason behind the call.

34:35.971 --> 34:38.290
She thinks you're hooking up
with Blake.

34:38.291 --> 34:41.570
No. Not happening,
nor will it.

34:41.571 --> 34:43.371
Go get Gabi some soup.
She's sick.

34:43.371 --> 34:47.091
I'm going to sleep off whatever
I'm coming down with...

34:47.092 --> 34:49.130
and hopefully not die.

34:49.132 --> 34:50.971
If I turn into a zombie
at some point,

34:50.972 --> 34:53.130
at least take a couple good pictures before you decapitate me.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.292
You have my word.

35:24.253 --> 35:26.893
Hey. You're okay.
It's just a fever.

35:26.894 --> 35:28.173
What are you doing here?

35:28.174 --> 35:33.013
We don't let women or clients
into the house. Ever.

35:33.014 --> 35:34.413
I texted you and called you,

35:34.414 --> 35:37.854
and then threatened Gabi,
who threatened Lex.

35:39.734 --> 35:40.973
That worried about me, huh?

35:40.974 --> 35:42.373
About you?

35:42.374 --> 35:45.774
Oh, no. I'm doing this for
entirely selfish reasons.

35:45.775 --> 35:49.415
If I lose my love coach,
I lose my love.

35:58.215 --> 36:01.374
Sorry. It just feels so good.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.054
You know what would make
me feel even better right now?

36:03.055 --> 36:04.094
What's that?

36:04.095 --> 36:05.334
You in a hot nurse outfit.

36:05.335 --> 36:07.935
You're such a pig.

36:07.936 --> 36:10.655
Right, but I'm more like one of
those cute little pigs.

36:10.656 --> 36:12.375
- Uh huh.
- You know, the teacup ones.

36:12.376 --> 36:15.655
The ones that are so cute, you
just want to keep it forever,

36:15.656 --> 36:18.575
OK. Come on.

36:19.577 --> 36:20.815
We need to get you in the bath.

36:20.816 --> 36:22.135
- No.
- Let's go.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.135
We need to get your fever down.
Come on.

36:24.136 --> 36:26.216
Just let me die.

36:33.137 --> 36:34.217
Come on.

36:36.057 --> 36:39.937
Never leave a man behind.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.137
All right. In the bath.

36:43.937 --> 36:45.137
Come on.

36:52.738 --> 36:55.217
Jesus Christ. Why is it so cold?

36:55.218 --> 36:56.138
It's not cold.

36:56.139 --> 36:58.897
It just feels like that
because you have a fever,

36:58.898 --> 37:01.858
which we need to get down.

37:04.578 --> 37:05.697
Alright, well, this is up there

37:05.698 --> 37:07.057
for the second worst day
of my life.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.658
Yeah, what's the first?

37:09.659 --> 37:11.659
The day I almost died.

37:13.619 --> 37:15.978
I think we could be best
friends.

37:15.979 --> 37:17.178
- Is that right?
- Mm hm.

37:17.179 --> 37:21.378
I only have two, Gabs and Lex.

37:21.379 --> 37:25.098
But I'm killing them off soon,
though, so there's a vacancy.

37:25.099 --> 37:27.698
Oh, well, that's good to know.

37:27.699 --> 37:29.418
But you have to cook for me.

37:29.419 --> 37:32.739
I can do that. I cooked for my
dad and brother all the time.

37:32.740 --> 37:36.019
- Really?
- Mm hm.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.419
Is your brother
as pretty as you?

37:38.420 --> 37:40.180
He's dead.

37:43.100 --> 37:46.820
I'm sorry. Dying sucks.

37:47.820 --> 37:50.100
Yeah, it really does.

37:58.141 --> 38:00.260
Blake?

38:00.261 --> 38:01.501
Yup.

38:02.221 --> 38:04.301
I like you.

38:06.341 --> 38:07.821
I like you, too.

38:42.223 --> 38:44.062
Clearly you're feeling better.

38:44.063 --> 38:46.343
Nope. Still a little delirious.

38:49.423 --> 38:52.142
Where we at with that
nurse outfit?

38:52.143 --> 38:55.703
No nurse costume.

38:55.704 --> 38:59.024
I think you're healed
and I have to get to practice.

38:59.584 --> 39:00.584
Fine.

39:05.104 --> 39:08.383
Yeah, that... it's morning.
It happens.

39:08.384 --> 39:11.423
- Yeah...
- That's not helping, Blake.

39:11.424 --> 39:15.025
Sorry. I'm just gonna...

39:18.745 --> 39:20.504
Sorry, I just wanted to say

39:20.505 --> 39:23.064
that you need to stay in bed,

39:23.065 --> 39:25.344
and that I left you two Tylenol.

39:25.345 --> 39:26.105
You should take those.

39:26.106 --> 39:29.144
And I will bring you food
after practice.

39:29.145 --> 39:30.504
Food?

39:30.505 --> 39:32.344
Food.

39:32.345 --> 39:35.505
You should probably take care
of that?

39:35.506 --> 39:38.786
You know,
a good nurse would stay and help me take care of that.

39:46.826 --> 39:47.826
Hey, Lex.

39:51.026 --> 39:52.186
Blake?

39:55.627 --> 39:56.986
Please tell me you got food for
me, too.

39:56.987 --> 40:00.186
I did. I got your favorite,
I think.

40:00.187 --> 40:02.507
Chow mein with pork, right?

40:06.347 --> 40:07.507
I got you soup.

40:17.508 --> 40:18.667
Sorry, is it hot?

40:18.668 --> 40:19.628
Yeah, it's freakishly hot.

40:19.629 --> 40:21.067
Sorry, I just picked it up.

40:21.068 --> 40:22.668
You know what?

40:26.028 --> 40:27.987
Can you blow?

40:27.988 --> 40:29.947
You want me to blow
on your soup?

40:29.948 --> 40:31.147
Are you twelve?

40:31.148 --> 40:33.508
Shit, it's really hot.

40:38.349 --> 40:40.188
You blow well.

40:40.189 --> 40:43.069
Coming from you I'll take that
as the highest of compliments.

40:46.269 --> 40:47.389
So what are we watching?

41:00.910 --> 41:01.910
Ian?

41:05.150 --> 41:06.430
What up, sweet cheeks?

41:15.110 --> 41:16.390
Out with it.

41:18.871 --> 41:23.990
Do you ever think that what you
thought you wanted isn't

41:23.991 --> 41:27.150
actually what you want anymore?

41:27.151 --> 41:29.670
You mean... like you've lived
your whole life in pursuit of

41:29.671 --> 41:33.110
one goal, and suddenly the goal
changes?

41:33.111 --> 41:36.111
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

41:37.031 --> 41:38.750
That's life, Blake.

41:38.751 --> 41:39.992
Is it?

41:41.392 --> 41:43.191
Doesn't that feel
so wishy washy,

41:43.192 --> 41:47.271
to go from one thing to another?

41:47.272 --> 41:49.391
That's all part of college.

41:49.392 --> 41:51.151
Discovering yourself.

41:51.152 --> 41:54.511
Realizing,"Hey, maybe
wearing flip-flops from 1992

41:54.512 --> 41:55.711
isn't as cool as I
originally thought.

41:55.712 --> 41:56.871
They not mine, you jerk.

41:56.872 --> 41:59.311
So you stole someone's
flip-flops and decided,

41:59.312 --> 42:00.472
"Hey, let's bring these back."?

42:00.473 --> 42:03.952
No. They were my brother's
and...

42:03.953 --> 42:08.112
after he died... I don't know...

42:08.113 --> 42:10.792
I just wanted to be close to
him.

42:10.793 --> 42:13.112
So you raided his closet?

42:13.113 --> 42:16.592
Everything smelled like him.
It was comforting.

42:16.593 --> 42:17.912
Until you had to wash them.

42:17.913 --> 42:20.273
Until my dad forced me
to wash them, yes.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.274
It's only been two
years. I still miss him.

42:27.434 --> 42:29.074
How'd he die?

42:29.874 --> 42:31.194
Car accident.

42:32.314 --> 42:33.474
Drunk driver.

42:36.394 --> 42:40.353
It's weird. It used to piss me
off talking about it,

42:40.354 --> 42:45.034
but for some reason, when I
started wearing his clothes,

42:45.035 --> 42:48.314
it's like... I don't know...

42:48.315 --> 42:51.075
it almost feels like
invisible armor.

42:57.435 --> 43:02.034
Well, I hate to break it to
you, but these flip flops

43:02.035 --> 43:03.315
are anything but invisible.

43:03.316 --> 43:04.476
Shut up!

43:08.756 --> 43:09.915
Did you just lick me?

43:09.916 --> 43:10.995
Yeah.

43:10.996 --> 43:11.796
First rule of kindergarten.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.355
- Did you miss that class?
- I must have missed it.

43:14.356 --> 43:15.955
You must have.

43:15.956 --> 43:17.315
It's right up there with fire
safety.

43:17.316 --> 43:19.996
So, it's a little important.

43:23.677 --> 43:25.316
Wow. Okay.

43:25.317 --> 43:27.036
I told you never to play
the player.

43:27.037 --> 43:31.876
I'm just following your rules.
That's all.

43:31.877 --> 43:33.637
Sometimes, I hate my rules.

43:35.157 --> 43:36.317
Me, too.

44:07.039 --> 44:09.198
Whoa...

44:09.199 --> 44:12.798
We're training, man.
We're training.

44:12.799 --> 44:14.878
We're setting up for a date
night for her and David.

44:14.879 --> 44:16.638
He's moving through the steps
so fast

44:16.639 --> 44:18.599
I figured he'd do something.

44:20.359 --> 44:21.998
I think I got it.

44:21.999 --> 44:23.958
Thank you, Ian.

44:23.959 --> 44:26.759
Blake. Wait. I'm sorry.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.519
I'm sorry I got carried away.

44:28.520 --> 44:29.599
I'll help you with David

44:29.600 --> 44:32.119
and then hopefully we can...

44:32.120 --> 44:33.480
be friends.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.079
Friends?

44:36.080 --> 44:38.519
Funny how words that are
supposed to make people happy,

44:38.520 --> 44:41.359
kind of make you want to punch
a tree like Chuck Norris.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.839
Yeah, friends.

44:47.001 --> 44:48.241
Friends it is.

44:50.961 --> 44:52.321
Hmm.

45:08.282 --> 45:10.801
You know, this isn't a sting,
right?

45:10.802 --> 45:12.761
You can take
your sunglasses off.

45:12.762 --> 45:16.081
Plus, we're indoors.

45:16.082 --> 45:17.321
You look ridiculous.

45:17.322 --> 45:19.441
You said not to make eye
contact,

45:19.442 --> 45:22.081
and that's happens to be
very difficult for me.

45:22.082 --> 45:24.881
So, sunglasses.

45:24.882 --> 45:27.121
Dude, just look at his crotch.
He'll eat that shit up.

45:27.122 --> 45:29.962
I'm not looking. No.

45:29.963 --> 45:31.482
Do you have any other pointers

45:31.483 --> 45:36.162
that don't involve me
staring at his... groin?

45:36.163 --> 45:39.642
I think you can do better than
that Miss Nursing Major.

45:39.643 --> 45:41.122
Nope. Not doing it.

45:41.123 --> 45:43.883
- Penis?
- Shut up.

45:44.723 --> 45:46.482
If you can't say it,

45:46.483 --> 45:47.922
should you really be playing
with it?

45:47.923 --> 45:49.403
- I mean, God...
- Oh, hell.

45:49.404 --> 45:50.883
Come here.

45:50.884 --> 45:53.683
Eventually you'll have to get
past the point of being

45:53.684 --> 45:55.443
afraid of your own sexuality.

45:55.444 --> 45:58.843
And something tells me that
David's not super great in bed,

45:58.844 --> 46:00.963
so you need to gain a little
bit of confidence

46:00.964 --> 46:02.723
so you can
tell him what you want.

46:02.724 --> 46:05.043
What makes you think that?

46:05.044 --> 46:08.043
I mean, I'm a virgin. So...

46:08.044 --> 46:09.683
I'm gonna suck.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.124
Impossible. Believe me.

46:11.125 --> 46:12.924
David, on the other hand...

46:12.925 --> 46:14.204
The last girlfriend we
interviewed,

46:14.205 --> 46:16.644
said, that although
he earned an A for effort,

46:16.645 --> 46:20.284
on multiple occasions she
studied for a test during.

46:20.285 --> 46:22.524
- During sex?
- Mm hm.

46:22.525 --> 46:25.364
That's so impersonal.

46:25.365 --> 46:29.764
Shouldn't you be putting
your whole mind into it?

46:29.765 --> 46:32.366
Your body? Your soul?

46:35.486 --> 46:36.845
We're getting off track.

46:36.846 --> 46:39.765
The point is, you may need to
give him direction.

46:39.766 --> 46:44.285
Meaning you may need to say
words like "penis". The end.

46:44.286 --> 46:46.605
Fine. Penis.

46:46.606 --> 46:47.406
Louder.

46:47.407 --> 46:48.646
Penis!

46:51.166 --> 46:52.406
Oh, hey man. Didn't see you
there.

46:52.407 --> 46:54.447
- Hey.
- How's it going?

46:57.167 --> 46:59.406
I thought you all were
more casual.

46:59.407 --> 47:02.487
No. We made it official last
night. Right, sweet cheeks?

47:10.287 --> 47:14.087
Sorry. It's just...
it was a really great night.

47:14.088 --> 47:16.247
Yeah, a great night.

47:16.248 --> 47:19.847
I'm happy for you, Blake.

47:19.848 --> 47:22.087
Really happy for you.

47:22.088 --> 47:24.088
We should get out of here.

47:34.650 --> 47:36.448
What? Why are you laughing?

47:36.449 --> 47:38.528
David just gave me the finger.

47:38.529 --> 47:41.328
Really? That's kind of rude.
Why would he do that?

47:41.329 --> 47:42.728
Because his hands were free...

47:42.729 --> 47:46.129
And mine weren't.

47:57.890 --> 48:00.969
Nice. I like.

48:00.970 --> 48:04.050
Good, because I haven't worn
them in forever.

48:07.410 --> 48:10.329
Guys.
You just gonna stand there and eye-screw each other,

48:10.330 --> 48:11.770
or can we get the snacks?

48:12.490 --> 48:13.930
Be there in a sec!

48:31.371 --> 48:32.811
Perfect.

48:35.251 --> 48:37.331
You down for a little game, boy?

48:37.332 --> 48:39.011
Did you just call me boy?

48:39.012 --> 48:40.051
I did.

48:40.052 --> 48:41.291
You do know I played pro
football.

48:41.292 --> 48:43.691
I didn't want to have to do
this,

48:43.692 --> 48:45.532
I'm pretty much good
at every sport.

48:48.212 --> 48:50.491
Except for golf.

48:50.492 --> 48:52.171
Really?

48:52.172 --> 48:54.611
I'm pretty sure we
established that ice-skating

48:54.612 --> 48:55.452
is not a sport.

48:55.453 --> 48:57.652
You are serving.

48:57.653 --> 49:00.852
Let me just get comfortable,
real quick.

49:00.853 --> 49:02.292
Oh it's like that, is it?

49:02.293 --> 49:03.773
Sure is.

49:04.653 --> 49:06.093
Two can play at that game.

49:11.973 --> 49:13.052
- Let's go.
- Ready.

49:13.053 --> 49:16.252
Yeah, Let's go Are you ready?

49:16.253 --> 49:17.533
Oh shit.

49:17.534 --> 49:19.533
My money's on Blake.

49:19.534 --> 49:23.173
You know he was nominated
for the Heisman, right?

49:23.174 --> 49:24.614
Is that a hard thing to get?

49:35.334 --> 49:37.494
That's my girl.
That's my girl.

49:47.215 --> 49:48.415
High five!

49:53.895 --> 49:55.735
What happened?

49:57.215 --> 49:58.215
What happened? Are you okay?

49:58.216 --> 49:59.775
- Yeah.
- Your knee?

49:59.776 --> 50:03.816
Come on Lex, let's go
grab an ice pack?

50:06.136 --> 50:07.656
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

50:09.376 --> 50:11.136
Here, put weight on me.

50:12.296 --> 50:14.375
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

50:14.376 --> 50:16.776
It's just an old injury.

50:18.136 --> 50:19.776
Prop it up.

50:19.777 --> 50:21.497
Shit.

50:24.457 --> 50:27.296
Oh, it's starting to swell.
What happened to your knee?

50:27.297 --> 50:29.897
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yes.

50:34.177 --> 50:35.816
I'm Superman.

50:35.817 --> 50:39.896
I injured it saving two old
ladies and their cats.

50:39.897 --> 50:43.057
He really is a hero. That poor
little boy would have died.

50:43.058 --> 50:45.017
Can you imagine what that would
have done to that father?

50:45.018 --> 50:47.617
After losing his wife?
It was amazing, Ian.

50:47.618 --> 50:50.257
- Don't sell yourself short.
- Okay, enough Gabs.

50:50.258 --> 50:51.178
We get it.

50:51.179 --> 50:52.738
Here. Thank you.

50:54.698 --> 50:57.377
- Put this on it.
- Thanks.

50:57.378 --> 50:59.177
Look, don't listen to her.

50:59.178 --> 51:00.537
I'm no hero.

51:00.538 --> 51:02.818
Here I am, being bitter
that I can't play football,

51:02.819 --> 51:05.098
and this kid could have died.

51:05.099 --> 51:08.138
Well, you sort of did, too.

51:08.139 --> 51:11.338
In a way, you lost part
of what made you you.

51:11.339 --> 51:13.818
You know?

51:13.819 --> 51:16.458
I got past it, you know?

51:16.459 --> 51:18.298
I don't want you to think I'm
one of those broken guys

51:18.299 --> 51:20.739
living the old glory days
of football.

51:21.859 --> 51:24.979
How did you get over it?

51:24.980 --> 51:26.419
It was the kid?

51:26.420 --> 51:30.259
He came and visited me
in the hospital

51:30.260 --> 51:33.179
I called him by his last name,
Montgomery, or Little Monty,

51:33.180 --> 51:34.619
because this kid was tiny.

51:34.620 --> 51:37.059
And apparently he's still afraid
of the dark...

51:37.060 --> 51:39.139
So, he brought me this bear,

51:39.140 --> 51:41.659
smartly named "Bear".

51:42.461 --> 51:47.940
His mom, unfortunately,
passed away earlier that year from cancer.

51:47.941 --> 51:50.500
She gave him that bear.

51:50.501 --> 51:52.620
It was supposed to be his
protection bear,

51:52.621 --> 51:54.461
to make him feel safe.

51:55.501 --> 51:57.140
He gave it to me.

51:57.141 --> 51:59.461
Said he didn't need it anymore,
because he had me.

52:03.141 --> 52:05.542
That bear lives the high life
in my room, I'll tell you that.

52:07.062 --> 52:09.981
And what about Monty?
Where is he now?

52:09.982 --> 52:12.501
He's actually going to be one
badass football player.

52:12.502 --> 52:15.541
His dad sends me his schedule
for his practices and games.

52:15.542 --> 52:18.701
I've been to a few.
He's not bad.

52:18.702 --> 52:20.262
You really are Superman.

52:22.142 --> 52:23.702
To one person, yeah.

52:24.462 --> 52:25.783
Two.

52:30.903 --> 52:32.703
Guys? You up for a movie?

52:34.223 --> 52:35.943
Yeah, we'll be right there.

52:43.423 --> 52:45.663
You guys. No. Just not
happening.

52:45.664 --> 52:47.224
Shower, or no couch time.

52:48.424 --> 52:50.303
Sure. We'll go shower.

52:50.304 --> 52:51.864
Not together!

53:07.705 --> 53:10.185
- What?
- What do you mean "what"?

53:24.545 --> 53:25.985
Hey, is Blake here?

53:26.905 --> 53:29.825
Hey, Blake?

53:29.826 --> 53:31.466
David's here to see you.

53:36.626 --> 53:37.906
What are you waiting for?

53:42.706 --> 53:46.305
Even if it takes All my life.

53:46.306 --> 53:49.466
Some days I think it might.

53:49.467 --> 53:53.146
It's always raining on me.

53:53.147 --> 53:55.986
Always raining on me.

53:55.987 --> 53:59.506
You know you can cut
Like a knife.

53:59.507 --> 54:02.226
You cut like a knife.

54:02.227 --> 54:05.746
And I'm just a puddle baby.

54:05.747 --> 54:07.986
Just a puddle baby.

54:07.987 --> 54:12.107
Oh oh.

54:12.108 --> 54:15.067
Even if it takes All my life.

54:15.068 --> 54:19.547
It's always easy
If it's black and white.

54:19.548 --> 54:22.947
We could never leave.

54:22.948 --> 54:25.907
The color inside the lines

54:25.908 --> 54:28.188
You've ruined me
for other women, Gia.

54:29.909 --> 54:30.989
Good.

54:32.469 --> 54:35.948
I can hardly breathe.

54:35.949 --> 54:38.629
If you're not by my side

54:42.189 --> 54:43.988
I'm going to make some popcorn.

54:43.989 --> 54:46.148
But your knee.

54:46.149 --> 54:49.629
It's just popcorn.
I think I'll be fine.

54:50.630 --> 54:52.990
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

54:58.390 --> 55:00.709
Blake, I'm fine,
go watch the movie.

55:00.710 --> 55:02.430
Not Blake.

55:04.910 --> 55:07.189
Something I can help you with?

55:07.190 --> 55:12.310
I get it. She's "yours"
a least for now.

55:12.311 --> 55:15.510
But, listen to me,
we have a history.

55:15.511 --> 55:18.310
And that is not something you
can compete with.

55:18.311 --> 55:21.911
Not now, not ever.

55:23.991 --> 55:27.390
Shit. How am I going to
compete with the tree house?

55:27.391 --> 55:28.830
Ooh!

55:28.831 --> 55:30.791
You smug bastard.

55:32.272 --> 55:37.191
Look, you don't deserve her.
You never will.

55:37.192 --> 55:39.271
Oh, but you do?

55:39.272 --> 55:44.272
Mr. Washed-up Has-been,
who can't keep it in his pants?

55:45.992 --> 55:49.191
Well, at least I know I don't
deserve her.

55:49.192 --> 55:52.752
At least I wake up everyday,
knowing I'm the lucky one.

55:52.753 --> 55:56.392
I wasn't aware it took this much
brainpower to make popcorn.

55:56.393 --> 55:59.232
Hey, I actually gotta get going.

55:59.233 --> 56:01.672
But, next Thursday seven
o'clock, right?

56:01.673 --> 56:02.992
- Yeah. I won't.
- Don't forget.

56:02.993 --> 56:05.552
Dad's really excited to see you.
It'll be fun.

56:05.553 --> 56:06.793
Cool.

56:07.513 --> 56:09.233
It's good to see you.

56:10.553 --> 56:11.753
Bye, Ian.

56:16.434 --> 56:17.954
- Blake...
- What?

56:20.234 --> 56:21.354
What do you want, Ian?

56:27.674 --> 56:28.834
Exactly what I thought.

56:30.834 --> 56:32.393
You. That's
what I should have said

56:32.394 --> 56:34.474
when she asked me what I wanted.

56:34.475 --> 56:36.875
Instead, I opened my mouth
and nothing came out.

56:46.155 --> 56:48.674
I hate mornings.

56:48.675 --> 56:49.635
Yep.

56:50.955 --> 56:52.314
FREAKING OUT!

56:52.315 --> 56:55.995
"Use your indoor
voice. Lex can hear you,

56:55.996 --> 56:59.835
also he hates mornings."

56:59.836 --> 57:01.635
David's dad bailed.
It's just us.

57:01.636 --> 57:03.475
I've never been on a date.

57:03.476 --> 57:05.156
Shit.

57:06.436 --> 57:07.396
Something wrong?

57:07.397 --> 57:09.675
Yeah, I gotta take Blake
on this fake date

57:09.676 --> 57:11.276
so she doesn't
puke all over David.

57:16.557 --> 57:18.556
"Be at the house at six,

57:18.557 --> 57:21.236
have Gabs help you get ready.

57:21.237 --> 57:23.876
She is the boss."

57:23.877 --> 57:24.917
Woop!

57:29.077 --> 57:30.797
I hate mornings.

57:33.717 --> 57:35.996
Did I say that already?

57:35.997 --> 57:37.437
I think so.

57:37.438 --> 57:38.837
Blake, come on.

57:38.838 --> 57:40.877
It can't be that bad. Let's go.

57:40.878 --> 57:42.317
No, it is.

57:42.318 --> 57:43.878
Very bad.

57:49.758 --> 57:51.357
Damn.

57:51.358 --> 57:53.637
Is it that bad?

57:53.638 --> 57:55.957
Yes. It's... horrific.

57:55.958 --> 58:01.078
How could you possibly attract
a man in this... monstrosity?

58:01.079 --> 58:03.398
Monstrosity, huh?

58:03.399 --> 58:06.119
Huh. Is that why
you keep staring at it?

58:07.319 --> 58:08.918
I literally can't look away.

58:08.919 --> 58:11.958
Don't even think I could if
I tried.

58:11.959 --> 58:14.518
Fake date. Remember?

58:14.519 --> 58:16.038
This is a fake date,

58:16.039 --> 58:17.718
so I don't make a
complete fool out of myself

58:17.719 --> 58:19.399
when David and I go out
on Thursday.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.159
Okay, but the second we leave
this the house,

58:21.160 --> 58:23.639
you've got to pretend it's real.

58:23.640 --> 58:25.319
I'll coach you, and
hopefully by Thursday

58:25.320 --> 58:27.999
we'll get news of a tragic
accident that David's lost

58:28.000 --> 58:29.240
all functionality of his penis.

58:31.960 --> 58:33.640
Are you sure I look okay?

58:34.840 --> 58:37.439
No, Blake.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.680
You look phenomenal.

58:42.081 --> 58:46.280
And if that bastard doesn't
say those exact words or better

58:46.281 --> 58:48.440
he's not deserving.

58:48.441 --> 58:49.761
Okay?

58:51.241 --> 58:53.321
- Shall we?
- Yes.

58:59.241 --> 59:00.961
We having a picnic or something?

59:00.962 --> 59:02.201
Rule number nine, Blake.

59:02.202 --> 59:04.321
If a guy wants to surprise
the shit out of you,

59:04.322 --> 59:05.441
don't question it.

59:05.442 --> 59:08.281
Just tell him how awesome he is.

59:08.282 --> 59:10.441
Okay, well you are awesome,

59:10.442 --> 59:12.721
and, the best fake date ever.

59:12.722 --> 59:15.241
You know what? We need to
pretend this is real, remember?

59:15.242 --> 59:17.121
Or what's the point?

59:17.122 --> 59:20.322
I don't know, maybe a fun night?
Some good food?

59:22.403 --> 59:23.643
Our ride.

59:25.923 --> 59:27.562
We're canoeing?

59:27.563 --> 59:30.802
Towards the restaurant, yeah.

59:30.803 --> 59:36.882
Okay, I have to admit to you,
that's pretty cool.

59:36.883 --> 59:39.522
Although I don't know how much help I'm going to be in this dress.

59:39.523 --> 59:41.443
Cross my heart, I won't
look up your skirt.

59:43.164 --> 59:44.724
Rule number seven?

59:46.884 --> 59:48.324
Men always lie.

01:00:19.885 --> 01:00:21.764
I'm Julio. I'll be your server
this evening.

01:00:21.765 --> 01:00:23.325
Can I get you started
with anything?

01:00:23.326 --> 01:00:25.126
Yeah, can we have two
margaritas on the rocks.

01:00:27.726 --> 01:00:29.205
Rule number ten.

01:00:29.206 --> 01:00:32.325
Only two drinks.
Not three, not four.

01:00:32.326 --> 01:00:33.485
I know you can get nervous,

01:00:33.486 --> 01:00:35.445
but after you go past two
drinks,

01:00:35.446 --> 01:00:36.485
you can lose your inhibitions,

01:00:36.486 --> 01:00:38.725
and things can get out of
control real fast.

01:00:38.726 --> 01:00:40.206
Two is a safe number.

01:00:41.326 --> 01:00:42.365
And, yeah, eat up,

01:00:42.366 --> 01:00:44.647
'cause you're going to need
that for your cardio later.

01:00:45.367 --> 01:00:46.766
Cardio?

01:00:46.767 --> 01:00:48.806
Yeah, Sex. With David?

01:00:48.807 --> 01:00:52.486
I, uh, I haven't really
thought about that.

01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:54.366
Tonight's
special is...

01:00:54.367 --> 01:00:57.166
Can you give us a minute?

01:00:57.167 --> 01:00:58.286
Thanks.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:02.007
You know it's going to
happen eventually, right.

01:01:02.847 --> 01:01:05.247
Yeah, I don't know.

01:01:05.248 --> 01:01:06.367
I don't really like thinking
about it

01:01:06.368 --> 01:01:12.047
because, honestly, it kinda
makes me want to puke.

01:01:12.048 --> 01:01:14.567
No, it's just... I'm going
to be horrible,

01:01:14.568 --> 01:01:18.887
I'm going make a fool of myself and he's going to hate it.

01:01:18.888 --> 01:01:22.327
Rule number six.
Guys never hate sex.

01:01:22.328 --> 01:01:23.527
If he's not getting off,

01:01:23.528 --> 01:01:26.288
it's either because he mistook
numbing gel for K-Y,

01:01:26.289 --> 01:01:30.128
or he's gay and you lack
the goods to get him there.

01:01:30.129 --> 01:01:33.529
- K-Y?
- Still need a minute?

01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:35.409
Yeah.

01:01:36.809 --> 01:01:39.568
If you can't even talk
about sex with David,

01:01:39.569 --> 01:01:43.048
why are you even going
on a date with him?

01:01:43.049 --> 01:01:45.368
I mean, why use my help?

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:49.970
It's just... don't you think
it's moving so fast?

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:51.530
I wanted him to notice me,

01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:55.530
not take me to bed two weeks
after your little plan worked.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.009
Well then, just say no.

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:02.569
Rules number twelve, thirteen
and fourteen

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:07.411
clearly say that you can
absolutely say no.

01:02:10.411 --> 01:02:12.370
So how did you get into this?

01:02:12.371 --> 01:02:13.971
How did you start Wingmen?

01:02:17.171 --> 01:02:19.970
Actually, it was my sister.

01:02:19.971 --> 01:02:24.210
She was, at the time, crushing
really hard

01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:26.130
on a guy from my team, and
when I say hard,

01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:29.451
I mean she drove her car
into a mailbox

01:02:29.452 --> 01:02:32.291
when we had him over for
Fourth of July.

01:02:32.292 --> 01:02:37.851
The sad thing is, he was
into her too.

01:02:37.852 --> 01:02:41.051
But she was always too shy and insecure to ever meet him half way.

01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:43.851
And I was always too selfish
to give a shit.

01:02:43.852 --> 01:02:49.092
So, she settled for a guy
who thinks that video games

01:02:49.093 --> 01:02:51.892
are like the Olympics.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:54.452
So there's two types
of settling.

01:02:54.453 --> 01:02:58.532
There's the type that is
cute, a match made in heaven,

01:02:58.533 --> 01:03:00.452
where you look at a couple
holding hands in public,

01:03:00.453 --> 01:03:05.292
and you think, "Is that girl
legally blind?"

01:03:05.293 --> 01:03:07.532
And then there's the other
type of settling,

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.813
which is the insecure type,

01:03:09.814 --> 01:03:11.453
where a girl never reaches
her full potential

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:16.254
and settles for someone
less than she's worth.

01:03:18.414 --> 01:03:20.453
My sister deserved better.

01:03:20.454 --> 01:03:23.453
And if she had just an ounce
of confidence,

01:03:23.454 --> 01:03:25.173
that would have
changed her life.

01:03:25.174 --> 01:03:28.013
Hell if she even had one
rule from my playbook,

01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:29.254
it would have changed her life.

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:33.975
Well, then... To the playbook.

01:03:34.975 --> 01:03:36.335
To the playbook.

01:03:41.815 --> 01:03:43.734
Okay, the final rule.

01:03:43.735 --> 01:03:45.414
If you're feeling like
the date's going good,

01:03:45.415 --> 01:03:47.134
and you want to continue,

01:03:47.135 --> 01:03:49.575
it's up to you
to invite them in.

01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:51.295
Okay.

01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:58.015
- Ian?
- Yeah.

01:03:58.016 --> 01:03:59.336
Do you want to come in?

01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:04.496
Well, that depends.

01:04:05.296 --> 01:04:06.375
On what?

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:07.815
Do you have refreshments?

01:04:07.816 --> 01:04:10.655
You can't just invite someone in
expecting something to happen,

01:04:10.656 --> 01:04:14.536
you have to have coffee,
drink, late night movie...

01:04:14.537 --> 01:04:16.057
It's kind of an unwritten rule.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.297
All of the above, how's that?

01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:26.857
I accept.

01:04:51.738 --> 01:04:54.339
Screw David. You're mine.

01:07:31.906 --> 01:07:33.985
Gabs, were you going
to suffocate me?

01:07:33.986 --> 01:07:36.705
No. Blake's a friend, and now
it's gonna be awkward.

01:07:36.706 --> 01:07:38.345
Not to mention she's a
freaking client.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:39.545
What the hell were you thinking?

01:07:39.546 --> 01:07:42.146
That I really like her,
David's a douche, and I'd

01:07:42.147 --> 01:07:44.107
rather die than let him touch
her.

01:07:45.067 --> 01:07:46.226
You mean you aren't bailing?

01:07:46.227 --> 01:07:48.106
Do I look like I'm jumping out
the window and making up

01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:49.986
a story about my dog?

01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:51.026
You don't have a dog.

01:07:51.027 --> 01:07:52.067
I know.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.986
Where is Blake?

01:07:57.987 --> 01:08:00.346
Baking. She got up at the ass
crack of dawn,

01:08:00.347 --> 01:08:05.227
went for a four mile run, then
decided to make you pancakes.

01:08:05.228 --> 01:08:07.307
- Pancakes?
- Mm hm.

01:08:07.308 --> 01:08:08.908
Mm. Alright.

01:08:10.468 --> 01:08:12.387
- Hi.
- Are you making pancakes?

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:13.747
I am. Good morning.

01:08:13.748 --> 01:08:15.547
- Good morning.
- You have to save two for Lex.

01:08:15.548 --> 01:08:17.147
He was freaking out that you
missed

01:08:17.148 --> 01:08:18.307
your normal meeting at the
bench.

01:08:18.308 --> 01:08:22.428
Shit. I didn't mean to sleep in.

01:08:22.429 --> 01:08:25.148
I know. You looked exhausted,
though,

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:26.548
and I didn't want to wake you.

01:08:26.549 --> 01:08:29.188
I was exhausted, sweet cheeks,
but in the best type of way,

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.868
the type where you probably should take a week off of school.

01:08:32.429 --> 01:08:33.429
Mm hm.

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.548
Think of the possibilities.

01:08:35.549 --> 01:08:37.028
This could change your life.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.988
Maybe it already has.

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:41.349
I could get really addicted
to your smell.

01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:43.350
Not in the kitchen, guys.

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:46.349
I will seriously grab
the pillow from upstairs.

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:47.389
Now break apart.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.709
For once, I'm not cooking,

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.509
so I want to sit
and enjoy my coffee

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.510
without watching real-life porn.

01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.151
So, who got laid last night?

01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:12.310
You know you can't hook up
with clients.

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:15.229
Yeah, that contract got
terminated

01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:16.670
the second she screamed my name.

01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:18.189
So, no David?

01:09:18.191 --> 01:09:19.991
- Yes.
- No.

01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:21.830
Did you say, "Yes?"

01:09:21.831 --> 01:09:23.390
He's still a friend.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:26.871
And I'm still gonna go to
dinner with him.

01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:29.471
I'm a friend and we screwed
about four times last night.

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:32.831
I'm sorry, was that all
it was to you?

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:35.911
Hell, no. Which is another
reason why I don't think

01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:38.350
you should be going on a
date with Douchepants.

01:09:38.352 --> 01:09:42.591
Look, it's fine, okay?

01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:44.551
I promise you, it is fine.

01:09:45.152 --> 01:09:46.272
Okay.

01:09:46.273 --> 01:09:48.551
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Put me down.

01:09:48.553 --> 01:09:49.752
We'll be back.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.032
Put me down,
I want a pancake.

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:54.033
- No pancakes for you.
- I'm hungry.

01:09:59.593 --> 01:10:01.392
Are you going to read your
compatibility report with Blake?

01:10:01.393 --> 01:10:02.593
Haven't decided yet.

01:10:05.553 --> 01:10:06.793
What are you doing home?

01:10:06.794 --> 01:10:07.953
I live here,

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.473
unless you're kicking me out,

01:10:09.474 --> 01:10:13.153
which you may do
after reading the report.

01:10:13.154 --> 01:10:14.794
- It's that bad?
- Hm.

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:20.713
"Stats show that if Client A,
Blake, were to embark on

01:10:20.714 --> 01:10:23.313
a relationship with Client B,
Ian,

01:10:23.314 --> 01:10:27.474
there is a 50 % chance that one or both hearts will be broken

01:10:27.475 --> 01:10:29.514
and that the relationship will
end within two months

01:10:29.515 --> 01:10:31.954
once the honeymoon stage
is done."

01:10:31.955 --> 01:10:35.435
- Okay. Hm.
- David's file.

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:40.674
"Report shows that if Client A
were to embark on a relationship

01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:44.554
with Client C, there is an 87 %
chance that the relationship

01:10:44.555 --> 01:10:47.595
will be a success and it will
bloom."

01:10:49.076 --> 01:10:51.075
Blake and David.

01:10:51.076 --> 01:10:52.356
It is what it is, you know.

01:10:56.436 --> 01:10:57.796
Not on my watch.

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.675
- You know what?
- What?

01:11:01.676 --> 01:11:03.355
I think you should fake
the flu tonight.

01:11:03.356 --> 01:11:05.716
Ian. Look at me.

01:11:06.916 --> 01:11:07.476
I can't.

01:11:07.477 --> 01:11:09.676
It reminds me that, tonight,
he's going to be looking at you,

01:11:09.677 --> 01:11:12.276
and every time I think
about him in the same damn room,

01:11:12.277 --> 01:11:15.116
I want to cut off his shooting
hand off

01:11:15.117 --> 01:11:16.117
and bury it in Gab's yard.

01:11:16.118 --> 01:11:17.916
Okay, listen,

01:11:17.917 --> 01:11:20.556
the sooner I can get tonight's
dinner over with,

01:11:20.557 --> 01:11:23.876
and tell him how happy I am
with you,

01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:27.596
the sooner we can get this whole
David thing behind us.

01:11:27.597 --> 01:11:30.157
Okay, just go.

01:11:30.158 --> 01:11:32.557
I won't be the
crazy-ass boyfriend

01:11:32.558 --> 01:11:35.237
who's jealous and drives you
to your date.

01:11:35.238 --> 01:11:36.038
So just go.

01:11:36.039 --> 01:11:38.277
- Alright.
- I'll see you tonight?

01:11:38.278 --> 01:11:40.357
I'll come by your place after.

01:11:40.358 --> 01:11:41.557
Okay.

01:11:41.558 --> 01:11:44.237
You know? Don't let him touch
you.

01:11:44.238 --> 01:11:45.357
Okay. Not even your back.

01:11:45.358 --> 01:11:46.477
If he's touching your back,

01:11:46.478 --> 01:11:47.797
it means he's thinking
of touching your ass.

01:11:47.798 --> 01:11:49.437
- Alright?
- Mm hm.

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:51.039
I promise.

01:11:51.919 --> 01:11:54.039
- Okay.
- Trust me?

01:11:55.239 --> 01:11:56.319
Yeah.

01:11:57.519 --> 01:11:59.199
Go get 'em.

01:12:01.759 --> 01:12:02.958
Tell me the truth,

01:12:02.959 --> 01:12:04.758
did you make the compatibility
report for me and Blake

01:12:04.759 --> 01:12:07.959
because you knew that one day
I'd jump into commitment-land?

01:12:09.039 --> 01:12:10.399
I...

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.759
input your information

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.439
the moment I saw things start
to change between you and Blake.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.800
Hell, the minute I noticed the
linger.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.400
Come again?

01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:24.279
The linger. You lingered.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.319
You leaned.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.919
Every muscle in your body tensed
when she walked into the room.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.959
I've never seen you
linger like that.

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:36.560
Shit.

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:38.240
I'm a 50, David's an 87.

01:12:38.241 --> 01:12:40.001
And he's with her right now.

01:12:42.761 --> 01:12:43.841
I'll drive.

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:48.680
She's facing him.

01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:53.162
She's not sitting across from,
but to the side.

01:12:56.162 --> 01:12:58.401
Bastard may have skills
after all.

01:12:58.402 --> 01:12:59.881
- You want to see?
- No.

01:12:59.882 --> 01:13:01.041
The absolute last thing
I want to see

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:03.281
is how close he's sitting
to her,

01:13:03.282 --> 01:13:05.001
or if he's strategically
dropping his napkin

01:13:05.002 --> 01:13:07.081
so he can inch his chair closer.

01:13:15.283 --> 01:13:17.482
It's scary how well
you know the male gender.

01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:18.602
Dinner is over.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:19.922
Ordering dessert,
then I'll be home.

01:13:19.923 --> 01:13:21.363
Don't worry.

01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:24.042
We should go.

01:13:24.043 --> 01:13:25.603
Hey, we should go.

01:13:38.084 --> 01:13:39.804
Hope you enjoyed
your dessert.

01:13:41.444 --> 01:13:42.564
Get me drunk.

01:13:45.524 --> 01:13:47.763
How does it feel?

01:13:47.764 --> 01:13:50.483
You mean getting my heart
broken?

01:13:50.484 --> 01:13:52.963
Gee, I don't know Lex.

01:13:52.964 --> 01:13:53.964
It kinda tickles,

01:13:53.965 --> 01:13:56.765
like getting a feather
stuck in my ass.

01:13:58.405 --> 01:14:00.364
I mean being on the other side.

01:14:00.365 --> 01:14:02.405
The one who gets rejected.

01:14:04.725 --> 01:14:06.244
He's a better fit.

01:14:06.245 --> 01:14:08.684
The numbers don't lie.

01:14:08.685 --> 01:14:10.365
- The numbers. Right.
- Yeah.

01:14:12.325 --> 01:14:16.725
Look, the numbers don't
take into account chemistry.

01:14:16.726 --> 01:14:18.205
Computers can't do that.

01:14:18.206 --> 01:14:21.125
Look. We're still technically
under contract with Blake,

01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:22.325
per our agreement.

01:14:22.326 --> 01:14:28.325
As long as she's gone on a date
with David, and kissed him...

01:14:28.326 --> 01:14:30.285
the contract's technically done.

01:14:30.286 --> 01:14:32.565
So, terminate the contract,

01:14:32.566 --> 01:14:36.326
collect payment
and delete her information.

01:14:37.847 --> 01:14:40.166
Think about this,

01:14:40.167 --> 01:14:42.166
by ignoring her, you run the
risk that...

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:46.367
That what? That I lose her
forever?

01:14:47.767 --> 01:14:49.087
She's already gone.

01:14:51.247 --> 01:14:52.567
She made her decision.

01:14:53.687 --> 01:14:55.327
She kissed him.

01:14:59.368 --> 01:15:00.568
I'm gonna get that.

01:15:02.728 --> 01:15:05.967
Hey, is Ian here?
I need to talk to...

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:07.327
Blake, you should go.

01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:09.607
No, I'm not leaving until I
talk to him.

01:15:09.608 --> 01:15:11.727
Lex, he doesn't
understand what he saw.

01:15:11.728 --> 01:15:13.247
I just need to explain.

01:15:13.248 --> 01:15:14.727
Fine. Explain to me.

01:15:14.728 --> 01:15:16.207
Why the hell was some other guy
kissing you?

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:18.448
I'd much rather talk to Ian
about that.

01:15:18.449 --> 01:15:20.688
Tough shit. You've got me.

01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:22.408
Okay. He kissed me, Lex!

01:15:22.409 --> 01:15:23.848
And you kissed him back.

01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:26.048
Am I missing some important
detail here,

01:15:26.049 --> 01:15:28.488
where you pushed him away,
kneed him in the balls?

01:15:28.489 --> 01:15:30.248
I did... push him away...

01:15:30.249 --> 01:15:31.608
You hesitated.

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:34.048
You must be proud of yourself.

01:15:34.049 --> 01:15:35.528
The first girl to take
down Ian Hunter

01:15:35.529 --> 01:15:37.608
and you just toss him
aside the second your

01:15:37.609 --> 01:15:38.848
childhood crush looks your way.

01:15:38.849 --> 01:15:40.889
David and I are just friends,

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:41.610
that's it.

01:15:41.611 --> 01:15:42.849
And you and Ian are what?

01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:44.089
You kissed another dude.

01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:46.129
Whatever you and Ian had is
over.

01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:48.449
Expect the contract
termination in the morning.

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:51.250
And honestly, I think
you're a bitch.

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:09.210
You hear that?

01:16:09.211 --> 01:16:11.010
Kinda hard not to.

01:16:11.011 --> 01:16:12.890
I didn't mean to call
her a bitch.

01:16:12.891 --> 01:16:14.290
I was just kinda caught
in the moment.

01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:19.091
Hey. If she cares about you,
she's going to be back.

01:16:20.051 --> 01:16:26.531
Three, two, one...

01:16:36.532 --> 01:16:39.211
No. Don't talk for two seconds
so I can speak.

01:16:39.212 --> 01:16:40.771
Tell Ian I need to talk to him

01:16:40.772 --> 01:16:43.693
and I won't stop calling
until he hears me out.

01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:46.333
I love him.

01:16:48.613 --> 01:16:50.333
I love him.

01:16:52.773 --> 01:16:54.332
Good answer.

01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:55.573
We'll be in touch.

01:17:02.694 --> 01:17:04.414
Two more.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:18.894
Can I talk to you?

01:17:22.694 --> 01:17:25.094
Did you get my email?
We're done.

01:17:25.095 --> 01:17:26.334
No, we're not.

01:17:26.335 --> 01:17:28.454
Ian, I love you.

01:17:28.455 --> 01:17:32.294
I love you so much, and I'm
sorry about the kiss.

01:17:32.295 --> 01:17:34.774
But I was confused.

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.574
It had nothing to do with you.

01:17:36.575 --> 01:17:37.775
No shit.

01:17:39.015 --> 01:17:40.854
Look, you did us both a favor.

01:17:40.855 --> 01:17:43.574
Our projected success rate
wasn't even close to being good.

01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:46.096
You should probably go be with who you wanted all along.

01:17:47.456 --> 01:17:49.135
You know all of that's changed.

01:17:49.136 --> 01:17:50.495
It was the sex.

01:17:50.496 --> 01:17:52.215
A chemical reaction occurs

01:17:52.216 --> 01:17:53.176
that emotionally bonds you
with someone

01:17:53.177 --> 01:17:54.575
when you have sex with them.

01:17:54.576 --> 01:17:57.015
Give it a few days,
it'll wear off.

01:17:57.016 --> 01:17:59.015
So will I.

01:17:59.016 --> 01:18:01.255
Ian, I'm telling you I love you,

01:18:01.256 --> 01:18:03.095
and you're just...

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:04.535
You're gonna push me away?

01:18:04.536 --> 01:18:06.296
Don't do that.

01:18:06.297 --> 01:18:10.697
Don't. Don't you care
about me a tiny bit?

01:18:15.617 --> 01:18:17.376
Your boyfriend's waiting.

01:18:17.377 --> 01:18:19.776
My boyfriend is standing
right in front of me.

01:18:19.777 --> 01:18:21.097
Not anymore.

01:18:23.017 --> 01:18:24.456
Ian.

01:18:24.457 --> 01:18:25.857
Be happy, okay?

01:18:25.858 --> 01:18:27.538
Hey Ian, good to see you buddy.

01:18:28.418 --> 01:18:29.538
How are you?

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:33.017
I'm out of here.

01:18:33.018 --> 01:18:34.897
And David?
Treat her right.

01:18:34.898 --> 01:18:37.497
I certainly will.
Just like I did last night.

01:18:37.498 --> 01:18:39.777
What? Ian!

01:18:39.778 --> 01:18:41.257
Disrespect her like that again
and I'll kill you.

01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:43.257
Dude, it was a joke.

01:18:43.258 --> 01:18:45.857
I'm kidding. You have said
the same stuff.

01:18:45.858 --> 01:18:48.179
You said the same... Babe.

01:18:52.819 --> 01:18:53.858
Ian!

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:56.258
Ian, wait.
Please let me talk.

01:18:56.259 --> 01:18:59.178
Wait, Please.

01:18:59.179 --> 01:19:03.218
Look, I only kissed David
to make sure of my feelings.

01:19:03.219 --> 01:19:05.338
It felt wrong and horrible

01:19:05.339 --> 01:19:08.379
and it just confirmed to me
that I love you.

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.300
Was that before or after you
screwed him?

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.699
Are you kidding me?

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.259
How does it go from kissing
to sex?

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.980
I basically walked you through
the steps, Blake.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.860
Are we done?

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.460
So done.

01:19:48.942 --> 01:19:52.182
I know what you're thinking,
I played this all wrong.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.421
I should call her...

01:19:55.422 --> 01:19:58.701
No. She kissed David.

01:19:58.702 --> 01:20:00.062
He's the right fit for her.

01:20:01.182 --> 01:20:02.182
I won't call her...

01:20:03.582 --> 01:20:06.142
But I miss her.

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:09.262
Fuck it, I'll text her...

01:20:10.143 --> 01:20:13.182
I miss you.

01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:15.702
You rejected me
when I said I love you.

01:20:15.703 --> 01:20:18.182
Go. To. Hell. Smiley face.

01:20:18.183 --> 01:20:19.422
A smiley face?

01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:23.022
Well, a smiley face means
there's was still hope. Right?

01:20:23.023 --> 01:20:24.942
But we all know a smiley
face does not mean

01:20:24.943 --> 01:20:26.862
"I want to have sex with you";

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:30.342
sometimes a smiley face just
means "I'm happy."

01:20:30.343 --> 01:20:32.463
But that mean she was happy for
me to go to hell?

01:20:32.464 --> 01:20:35.344
Or just... happy?

01:20:36.824 --> 01:20:39.423
Get up. Stop moping around.

01:20:39.424 --> 01:20:40.703
I love you like a brother,

01:20:40.704 --> 01:20:42.944
but this compatibility report
is ruining your life.

01:20:44.424 --> 01:20:46.183
It says I'd break her
heart in two months.

01:20:46.184 --> 01:20:49.943
And with David, on the other
hand, she'd be in bliss.

01:20:49.944 --> 01:20:55.025
Yeah... well, I may have...
tweaked the numbers a bit...

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:57.305
Lex, what did you do?

01:20:57.306 --> 01:20:59.024
What I had to.

01:20:59.025 --> 01:21:00.624
Remember when
we first started Wingmen?

01:21:00.625 --> 01:21:02.145
The oath we both took?

01:21:06.785 --> 01:21:09.104
Never fall in love.

01:21:09.105 --> 01:21:10.624
What, on the same drunken
evening,

01:21:10.625 --> 01:21:11.985
what did you make me
swear to you?

01:21:14.706 --> 01:21:16.225
That you wouldn't let me.

01:21:16.226 --> 01:21:17.545
Mm hm.

01:21:17.546 --> 01:21:18.986
And why is that?

01:21:20.906 --> 01:21:23.506
Because I'm sick of losing shit.

01:21:24.866 --> 01:21:27.185
Yeah.

01:21:27.186 --> 01:21:28.906
Man, you were supposed to
have my back.

01:21:32.026 --> 01:21:34.146
So, I did.

01:21:34.147 --> 01:21:36.586
I changed the numbers, man.
Just a little.

01:21:36.587 --> 01:21:37.547
But enough for you to bail.

01:21:37.548 --> 01:21:40.066
Don't you get it?
It doesn't matter.

01:21:40.067 --> 01:21:43.267
The numbers can be manipulated.
But the heart... can't.

01:21:46.587 --> 01:21:48.026
Damn poet.

01:21:48.027 --> 01:21:49.747
That's how you get so much ass.

01:21:52.147 --> 01:21:53.908
I know where David is partying
tonight,

01:21:55.348 --> 01:21:56.427
and word on the street is

01:21:56.428 --> 01:21:59.867
he's at it alone while Gabs
hangs out with Blake.

01:21:59.868 --> 01:22:00.907
Care for a drink?

01:22:00.908 --> 01:22:02.347
What?

01:22:02.348 --> 01:22:03.947
I wish, Mr. Goody Two-Shoes,

01:22:03.948 --> 01:22:06.067
"Oh look a butterfly,
Let's hug a tree,"

01:22:06.068 --> 01:22:09.347
was actually as bad
as I wish he was.

01:22:09.348 --> 01:22:12.467
If that were the case, yeah.
But it's not.

01:22:12.468 --> 01:22:15.228
Remember one of the most
important stats?

01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:18.108
Guys typically mess up within
two weeks of a new relationship.

01:22:18.109 --> 01:22:19.988
And why is that?

01:22:19.989 --> 01:22:21.468
God complex.

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:26.148
"I stole a sexy piece of ass

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:29.028
from Ian Hunter, so I
can get any chick I want,

01:22:29.029 --> 01:22:29.989
so come hither, my pretties,

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.949
while I show you
what a real man can do."

01:22:33.509 --> 01:22:35.068
You silver-tongued devil.

01:22:35.069 --> 01:22:37.070
Get your shit together.
We leave in fifteen.

01:23:04.791 --> 01:23:06.110
I'm downtown
and need a ride.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:09.231
Is it normal to see
Pinocchio after doing â€˜shrooms?

01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:15.150
I'll be right
there.

01:23:15.151 --> 01:23:18.632
And just like that,
I'm back in the game.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.431
You don't look
high as a kite.

01:23:28.432 --> 01:23:29.791
Did you want to get a drink?

01:23:29.792 --> 01:23:31.911
No, I don't want to get a drink.

01:23:31.912 --> 01:23:33.431
You do realize the last time
I saw you,

01:23:33.432 --> 01:23:34.352
you almost killed David

01:23:34.353 --> 01:23:37.031
and somehow simultaneously
broke my heart in the process.

01:23:37.032 --> 01:23:38.912
And now, you're just gonna
call me drunk...

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:43.352
I'm not drunk. Okay.

01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:44.512
I have a confession to make.

01:23:44.513 --> 01:23:46.833
And I know it's not particularly
romantic, but...

01:23:47.993 --> 01:23:49.513
I love you.

01:23:51.753 --> 01:23:56.633
Did you just throw out
an "I love you"? While high?

01:23:57.593 --> 01:23:59.553
I lied about being high.

01:23:59.554 --> 01:24:02.474
And yeah, I did, because
it's true.

01:24:04.434 --> 01:24:08.873
I've fallen ass-over-heels
in love with you.

01:24:08.874 --> 01:24:10.553
I desperately want you.

01:24:10.554 --> 01:24:14.273
I need you. I fuckin' crave you.

01:24:14.274 --> 01:24:15.913
I was scared.

01:24:15.914 --> 01:24:18.233
- You're scared?
- Yeah.

01:24:18.234 --> 01:24:19.994
Ian Hunter is scared?

01:24:19.995 --> 01:24:21.994
I'm scared that you'd be
settling for me,

01:24:21.995 --> 01:24:24.234
when David is the one you've
wanted all along.

01:24:24.235 --> 01:24:27.474
You know that I'd be settling
with him.

01:24:27.475 --> 01:24:29.714
Ian, I wouldn't settling
with you.

01:24:29.715 --> 01:24:31.555
You know that.

01:24:36.995 --> 01:24:38.794
I promise you this.

01:24:38.795 --> 01:24:42.395
It will only ever be you, Blake.

01:24:42.396 --> 01:24:44.355
You're the only person I want
to wake up with...

01:24:44.356 --> 01:24:46.956
the only person I want to spend
my nights with.

01:24:47.956 --> 01:24:49.116
I love you.

01:24:52.396 --> 01:24:53.596
I love you.

01:24:56.556 --> 01:24:57.916
Just kiss him already.

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:09.916
So this is the part
of the story

01:25:09.917 --> 01:25:10.996
where we cheer to new beginnings

01:25:10.997 --> 01:25:12.636
and lots of happy endings.

01:25:12.637 --> 01:25:16.076
And while I pride myself
on the success of Wingman, Inc.

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.796
I've learned first hand
that sometimes...

01:25:17.797 --> 01:25:19.797
Are you talking in voice-over
again?

01:25:20.637 --> 01:25:21.796
Sure was, sweet cheeks.

01:25:21.797 --> 01:25:24.078
Do you mind?

01:25:25.558 --> 01:25:26.478
As I was saying,

01:25:26.479 --> 01:25:28.037
sometimes you've got
to forget all the rules

01:25:28.038 --> 01:25:31.037
and follow your heart.

01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:32.997
Oh that's too bad...

01:25:32.998 --> 01:25:37.158
I was hoping we could do rule
number eighteen again.

01:25:41.598 --> 01:25:42.758
Alright, let's go.

01:25:43.519 --> 01:25:44.519
Ian.

01:25:48.159 --> 01:25:50.518
Did Ian talk to you?

01:25:50.519 --> 01:25:54.078
He talks to me everyday,
you need to be more specific.

01:25:54.079 --> 01:25:56.478
Now that he's with Blake he
wants to limit his Wingmen work

01:25:56.479 --> 01:25:59.438
and said I can work with you
guys.

01:25:59.439 --> 01:26:00.879
Not a chance in hell.

01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:04.335
Oh, there's a chance.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.879
Yeah, a chance you'll
poison my Lucky Charms

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.920
and we'll kill each other.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.042
Gabi!

01:26:22.334 --> 01:26:25.360
If you were an ocean I'd dive in.

01:26:25.361 --> 01:26:27.200
And grab some sand.

01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:30.320
Come up for a deep breath
Hold it.

01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:33.080
And take your wave again.

01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:36.840
If you were a jazz song
I'd scat along.

01:26:36.841 --> 01:26:38.880
To be a part of your song.

01:26:38.881 --> 01:26:41.040
Play all night with you.

01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:43.320
And we'd be in the groove.

01:26:43.321 --> 01:26:45.841
Every time I see you
I just freeze.

01:26:45.842 --> 01:26:48.281
Quietly my world turns
Upside down

01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:51.121
I'm falling in
And I can barely breathe

01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:53.801
I don't know what to do
When you're around.

01:26:53.802 --> 01:26:56.281
Just want to get Close to you.

01:26:56.282 --> 01:26:58.801
And I would know what to do.

01:26:58.802 --> 01:27:01.641
Just want to get Close to you.

01:27:01.642 --> 01:27:04.561
And I would know what to do.

01:27:04.562 --> 01:27:07.402
If you were a smooth shot
Of whiskey

01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:09.762
I'd drink you down.

01:27:09.763 --> 01:27:12.642
Sip you so slowly.

01:27:12.643 --> 01:27:14.882
Then have another round.

01:27:14.883 --> 01:27:17.962
If you were a slow dance
I'd learn you.

01:27:17.963 --> 01:27:23.402
Dip you and turn you
Past your every move.

01:27:23.403 --> 01:27:25.362
Then I'd be next to you.

01:27:25.363 --> 01:27:28.043
Every time I see you
I just freeze.

01:27:28.044 --> 01:27:30.403
Quietly my world turns
Upside down

01:27:30.404 --> 01:27:33.123
I'm falling in
And I can barely breathe

01:27:33.124 --> 01:27:35.923
I don't know what to do
When you're around.

01:27:35.924 --> 01:27:38.443
Just want to get Close to you.

01:27:38.444 --> 01:27:40.883
And I would know what to do.

01:27:40.884 --> 01:27:43.923
Just want to get Close to you.

01:27:43.924 --> 01:27:46.923
And I would know what to do.

01:27:46.924 --> 01:27:49.084
If you were to love me
High above me.

01:27:49.085 --> 01:27:51.044
Everything I'm looking for.

01:27:51.045 --> 01:27:52.324
Thinking 'bout you more and more.

01:27:52.325 --> 01:27:54.404
Love me Would you love me.

01:27:54.405 --> 01:27:57.004
How can I know?
I can't I be sure.

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.724
Every time I see you
I just freeze.

01:27:59.725 --> 01:28:02.284
Quietly my world turns
Upside down

01:28:02.285 --> 01:28:04.924
I'm falling in
And I can barely breathe

01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:07.444
I don't know what to do
When you're around.

01:28:07.445 --> 01:28:10.205
Just want to get Close to you.

01:28:10.206 --> 01:28:12.605
And I would know what to do.

01:28:12.606 --> 01:28:15.405
Just want to get Close to you.

01:28:15.406 --> 01:28:18.005
Just want to get Close to you.

01:28:18.006 --> 01:28:20.765
Just want to get Close to you.

01:28:20.766 --> 01:28:23.205
And I don't know what to do.

01:28:23.206 --> 01:28:25.925
Just want to get Close to you.

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:29.286
Just want to get Close to you
