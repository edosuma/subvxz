    That's one, two, three--

00:08.676 --> 00:12.044
- You cannot bet--those are blue
  corn chips, they're $5 each.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.079
      - It's a $20 buy-in.
       How broke are you?

00:14.081 --> 00:17.282
 Hard up you could always sell
  that beautiful head of hair

00:17.284 --> 00:18.584
         That you have.
      I will give you $40

00:18.586 --> 00:23.188
       I highly recommend
  that you accept that offer.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.723
  - Why don't you just get off
          your ducket,

00:24.725 --> 00:26.792
 Come down to the luncheonette
       and record another

00:26.794 --> 00:29.094
Corny seasonal song, like, maybe
      something for, ooh,

     Daylight savings time.
   Spring forward, fall back,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.767
       It writes itself.
 - Actually I have good songs,

00:34.769 --> 00:37.302
 I've written them, but I just
  don't have any contacts left

00:37.304 --> 00:38.303
     In the music industry.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.072
             - Oh.
    - Music industry's dead.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.241
  In the digital age it's all
  about getting in the studio

00:42.243 --> 00:43.609
  With an innovative producer.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.711
- Did you listen to a podcast on
         the way here?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.212
 - That's what my friend tammy,
              from

00:47.214 --> 00:48.580
 <i> Toddler time sing-a-long</i> says.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.715

00:49.717 --> 00:51.250
             Wait,
  you know toddler time tammy?

00:51.252 --> 00:53.152
Do you also know the muffin man?

00:53.154 --> 00:57.389
Happens to be married to a very
      influential guy, so.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.590
   - Is it peter cottontail?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.292
   Or john jacob jingleheimer
            schmidt?

01:00.294 --> 01:01.827
   - His name is my name too.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.429
      - Wait, wait, wait,
      did you say idalis?

01:03.431 --> 01:07.366
As in johnny idalis, the genius,
     biggest music producer

01:07.368 --> 01:09.101
      In the world idalis?
            - Yeah.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.402
         - You're bros
      with johhny idalis?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.804
     - I mean, I know him.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.272
  I'm actually going to dinner
     with him this weekend.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.773
           - Stop it.
   - I mean, I never met him,

01:14.775 --> 01:16.275
    I'm invited to his son's
          bar mitzvah.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.609
- I--I have to be your plus one.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.311
             - No.
     It's not a night club,

01:19.313 --> 01:22.181
   It's a religious ceremony.
  Plus, laurie is my plus one.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.149
         - God wants me
      to go to that party.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.818
        This is perfect,
 there's no other explanation.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.220
    I can show johnny idalis
            my song.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.355
    - God wants me to ditch
        my pregnant wife

01:30.357 --> 01:32.491
       So you can hobnob
      with a music mogul?

01:32.493 --> 01:34.259
           - Exactly.
   Okay, I am feeling flush,

01:34.261 --> 01:35.627
 We're going to a bar mitzvah,

01:35.629 --> 01:38.730
    I am raising the stakes,
   we're going two pretzels.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.371
          - You know,
   we're at marcus minus 30.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.739
     So you know the drill.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.641

     get out the back door,

01:49.643 --> 01:51.677
    And don't leave a trace.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.312
            - Yeah.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.448
          You know...

01:56.450 --> 01:59.551
  All this sneaking in and out
       of the house, it--

01:59.553 --> 02:02.821
   Fiona, it's--time for you
         to tell marcus

02:02.823 --> 02:07.292
- Oh, I know, but he's just such
      a uniquely sensitive

02:07.294 --> 02:09.895
 Child, and I'm not really sure
     he's over the death of

02:09.896 --> 02:12.498

    to tell him I'm shagging

02:12.500 --> 02:14.266
     His teacher, I mean--
     - you're going to have

02:14.268 --> 02:16.602

         I mean, unless

02:16.604 --> 02:18.604
  You're not planning on there
      being an eventually.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.373

     And I will, I promise.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.608
    I will tell him, I will.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.343
        - Great, great.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.146
Because you know, you don't want
  him finding out on his own.

02:27.148 --> 02:30.215
       After all, you two
    are unusually connected.

02:30.217 --> 02:33.919

      unusually connect--

  Let's go that way, shall we?
         There we are.

    - What's that poking me?
        - My usb stick.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.980
           - Oh, god.
              Ooh!

15:48.982 --> 15:53.418
- Thanks, you guys, for sharing
      your story tonight.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.253
 I don't know if any of it got
     through to him, but--

15:55.255 --> 15:57.188
      - You know, listen,
   whatever happens, at least

15:57.190 --> 15:58.723
  He has a supportive father,
  that's more than I ever had.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.392
  - Yeah, my dad never thought
    I'd amount to anything.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.627
    Never thought I'd get my
       driver's license,

16:02.629 --> 16:05.029
   And now I've got a driver.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.298
           - [laughs]
   what business are you in?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.667
- Oh, I'm in the music business.
        - Is that right?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.703
      - I'm a songwriter.
    That's crazy, I actually

16:11.705 --> 16:13.538
   As a matter of fact have--
         - wait, will,

16:13.540 --> 16:14.739
          Is that you?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.140
   - What are you doing here?

16:16.142 --> 16:17.475
         - We're having
     the time of our lives,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.744
     We're party crashers.
       - Dude, not cool.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.980
    - Marcus, there you are.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.481
            - Fiona!

16:23.483 --> 16:26.351
            - Will,
   why are you stroking andy?

16:26.353 --> 16:29.320
- Well, now, wait, I won't have
 anyone made to feel less than

16:29.322 --> 16:30.488
Because they're gay and in love.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.657
             - Gay?
         If you're gay,

16:32.659 --> 16:35.460
     Then who's the retinue
    of half-naked trollops

16:35.462 --> 16:37.061
     Who parade in and out
    of your house everyday?

16:37.063 --> 16:38.162
        - Hairdressers.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.597
        - Is this true?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.466
   Have you been lying to us?
          - Wait, mom,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.668
    What are you doing here
        with mr. Chris?

16:43.670 --> 16:47.505
  And why are you wearing that
"I don't respect myself" dress?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.574
     - You didn't tell him.
      - Wait, wait, wait.

16:49.576 --> 16:54.145
Was anyone here actually invited
   to our son's bar mitzvah?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.480
          - I'm sorry.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.149
       And laurie's real.

17:03.122 --> 17:03.354
               .

17:03.356 --> 17:06.223
   Knowing when to peace out.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.160
     And that time is now.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.061
          But, hey...

17:11.064 --> 17:13.164
  I gotta say you impressed me
            tonight.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.500
Didn't think you had it in you.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.103
           - [laughs]
    honestly, neither did I.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.039
 - Chris, I'm so sorry I lied.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.042
   I--you have to understand,
 it's just been marcus and me.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.645
  For so long, it's just been
         the two of us,

17:27.646 --> 17:30.048
       And I didn't know
        how to tell him.

17:30.050 --> 17:34.185
  - I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
   let you talk to your son.

17:37.056 --> 17:42.293
 You know, fiona, it's not just
    the two of you anymore.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.206
       - Hey, mr. Idalis,
         wait, please!

17:55.208 --> 17:58.676
  I--I've written a hit song,
   I'm a big deal, like you.

17:58.678 --> 18:03.548
     But I was successful.
 And I just, how do I put this?

18:03.550 --> 18:05.483
 I've been, like, in the desert
        for 40 years and

18:05.485 --> 18:08.152
I just need my moses to lead me
     to the promised land.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.188
       - You know, first,
     you pretend to be gay,

18:10.190 --> 18:11.355
 Now you belittle my religion.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.690
        You disgust me.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.826
      - Disgust isn't what
   I was going for, exactly.

18:14.828 --> 18:19.130
 Maybe we can build from that.
- Dad, I have to say something.

18:19.132 --> 18:23.234
Tonight, watching those two guys
 do whatever...They were doing,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.169
    I figured something out.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.404
 There's nothing more pathetic

18:26.406 --> 18:28.306
        Than pretending
   to be someone you're not.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.877
       So...Here it goes.

18:32.879 --> 18:36.581
            I'm gay.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.750
       - I've never been
        so proud of you.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.386
        I love this boy!

18:42.388 --> 18:44.555
      No, I love this man.

18:44.557 --> 18:49.127
           [laughter]

18:49.129 --> 18:51.162
 - Looks like love was the big
        winner tonight.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.197
- No, you're touching my family.
     Don't touch my family.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.500
      - In this thumbdrive
         is a hit song.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.734
             - Mm.
 - I just need you to listen--

18:56.736 --> 18:58.402
- Just get the hell out of here.
          - I'll call

18:58.404 --> 19:00.671
     Your office tomorrow.
      - No, don't bother.

19:00.673 --> 19:05.643
I think we need to remember the
 <i> toddler time</i> forgiveness song.

19:05.645 --> 19:10.781
  ¶ it's okay, it's all right,
   everyone makes mistakes ¶

19:10.783 --> 19:12.550
         ¶ sometimes ¶

19:12.552 --> 19:15.786
            - Leave.
            - Okay.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.157
      - Wha--marcus, wait.
            Hold on.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.659
   - I'm not talking to you,
         teacher lover.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.163
   - Wait, we'll get to that,
      but we need to talk

19:25.165 --> 19:28.266
    About some consequences
   for your behavior tonight.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.269
       - Of all the guys
      in the whole world,

19:31.271 --> 19:33.604
        Why did you have
      to pick my teacher?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.908
Do you have any idea how deeply
   disgusting this is for me?

19:36.910 --> 19:40.211
      - Do you even care?
        - Course I care.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.647
  - I--I don't know why I fell
       for your teacher.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.183
  I wish it was someone else,
         but it's not.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.351
 And can't we just move forward
        from this point?

19:47.353 --> 19:50.888
   Can we just find a way of
    finding some acceptance?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.857
             - No.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.425
    I'm not accepting this.

19:54.427 --> 19:58.329
        It's too gross.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.830
     I'm gonna go upstairs
      and brush my teeth,

19:59.832 --> 20:06.537
  Because I had sugar tonight.
    Bleached, white, sugar!

20:13.545 --> 20:15.913
 - I--I didn't have fun tonight
    at all, it was terrible.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.416
  - Yeah, let's never do that
             again.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.652
     - So what happens now?
     I just call you, or--

20:21.654 --> 20:27.225
       - Yeah, you know,
    we call each other, so.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.227
        Yeah, good-bye.

20:29.229 --> 20:34.932
      - Okay, I'll just--
             yeah.

20:34.934 --> 20:40.238
        You don't gotta
       be weird about it.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.640
       [knocking at door]

20:47.446 --> 20:56.287
- ¶ good night to the mountains
   and the skies above them ¶

20:56.289 --> 21:03.694
    ¶ good night to the moon
        and the stars ¶

21:03.696 --> 21:10.868
      Both: ¶ good night,
     sweet planet of ours ¶

21:10.870 --> 21:19.610
         ¶ good night,
     sweet planet of ours ¶
