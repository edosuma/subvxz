WEBVTT

00:11.594 --> 00:14.097
I actually had one
just like this as a kid

00:14.180 --> 00:17.559
and I fucking loved it
but what even are these photos?

00:17.642 --> 00:19.853
I had one too. Mine had
pictures of the Grand Canyon,

00:19.936 --> 00:22.605
but there's a terrifying
stalker photo of me in there

00:22.689 --> 00:23.857
and then some abstract images.

00:23.940 --> 00:24.941
I don't--
I don't know what they are.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.317
Definitely
feels like something

00:26.401 --> 00:28.069
a serial killer leaves behind.

00:28.945 --> 00:32.365
Quick question about Berlin--
uh, the briefcase,

00:32.449 --> 00:34.784
the bloody wig,
the weird bombing.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.077
Or a gas main leak.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.746
That just is easier to accept
than a bombing.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.789
Okay, fine. Uh...

00:39.873 --> 00:41.458
Then you just
disappeared on us

00:41.541 --> 00:43.543
for a number of hours.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.003
Cass, it literally feels like
you're living

00:45.086 --> 00:47.922
- in a John le Carré spy novel.
- What?

00:48.006 --> 00:50.008
Just, what the fuck are you
involved in, Cassie?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.885
- Nothing.
- Say "nothing" again.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.011
- Nothing.
- I don't believe

00:53.094 --> 00:54.345
- a word you're saying.
- Nothing.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.931
Nothing!

00:59.517 --> 01:00.852
It's like
some Animal Planet shit.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.647
Okay. Okay.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.232
Fuck it. Um...

01:07.317 --> 01:08.902
I have a little side job.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.989
I'm an asset for the CIA.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.701
I know we said no more
secrets,

01:16.785 --> 01:18.328
but it's the CIA,
and they're very secretive.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.537
I had to, and
I was dying to tell you

01:19.621 --> 01:21.164
plus you were just
about to guess it anyway.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.582
- What does it matter?
- Cassie, I was, like,

01:22.665 --> 01:25.126
literally nowhere close
to figuring that out.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.294
Wow.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.838
Okay, well, um,
there's a little more.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.548
Oh, I have this handler,
his name is Benjamin.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.966
- He hates me.
- What?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.927
So I get these marks
and I have to go find them

01:34.010 --> 01:35.094
and I spy on them.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.679
Yeah, and I was in Berlin
and there was this woman

01:36.763 --> 01:39.182
and she looked exactly like me.
She even had my same tattoo.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.433
Then there was
this huge explosion,

01:40.517 --> 01:41.601
I literally fell down,

01:41.684 --> 01:43.436
and then my ears
were absolutely ringing.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.605
- C-I-A?
- Yes. Those letters.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.690
Yes, those--yes, babe.
The CIA.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.819
Okay. It...

01:50.902 --> 01:53.696
sounds like someone's
maybe trying to frame you.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.032
Oh, good, perfect.
Go to the most terrifying thing.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.367
- Great.
- If this double lady

01:57.450 --> 01:58.660
was wearing that wig,

01:58.743 --> 02:00.703
is the blood from the dead guy
on your suitcase?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.372
We don't even know how this
got to LAX, okay?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.415
Whoever was stalking me
in Berlin

02:04.499 --> 02:07.085
could've--is obviously
probably stalking me here. I--

02:07.168 --> 02:09.003
I don't think you go
to all this trouble then just

02:09.087 --> 02:10.630
show up at your place, right,
Annie?

02:10.713 --> 02:14.217
Santal 33.
Fucking Santal 33?

02:14.300 --> 02:16.594
That is some seriously
expensive perfume.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.807
Okay, did you tell
your CIA handler guy,

02:20.890 --> 02:22.892
uh, Benjamin, the one
who hates you, about this?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.060
Annie, he doesn't hate me.

02:24.143 --> 02:25.979
He just doesn't like me.
Keep up!

02:26.062 --> 02:27.355
You literally just said
that he hated you.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.150
Oh, my God,
he's calling me right--

02:31.234 --> 02:33.236
- literally right now. What--

02:33.319 --> 02:35.155
Okay, I'm sorry,
that is suspicious as fuck.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.782
Oh, my God, he's calling again.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.576
It's not that suspicious.
The NSA can listen

02:39.659 --> 02:40.910
even when the phone's
turned off.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.036
I don't need to hear that.
Just--

02:43.162 --> 02:44.414
Hey, Benjamin, how are you?

02:44.497 --> 02:46.791
I'm calling about your debrief
on Berlin.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.294
Tomorrow noon work? We have
a lot to discuss, Bowden.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.087
Okay, yeah, it's--
it's kinda late,

02:51.170 --> 02:52.714
so do you mean,
like, today tomorrow?

02:52.797 --> 02:54.215
Or actually tomorrow
tomorrow that--

02:54.299 --> 02:56.718
- Hel--

02:57.510 --> 02:59.429
Okay, this is not good.
They've already grounded me,

02:59.512 --> 03:01.097
which is weird,
and it was already weird

03:01.180 --> 03:02.557
before we opened
the weird suitcase.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.183
How am I gonna explain
any of this?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.102
Honestly, I don't think
that you should.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.770
The wig,
definitely the View-Master,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.355
it could all be
inculpatory evidence.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.649
- Words that I know! What?
- It means you were involved.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.193
Shit, us too, 'cause our DNA's
now all over the place.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.570
Look, I had this client once.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.697
He found a severed head
in the trunk of his Mercedes.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.616
Did he put it there?
Definitely not.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.868
Did the jury care?
Definitely not.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.621
Is there anyone at the CIA
that you can trust?

03:24.704 --> 03:25.955
I do have a good friend
at the CIA,

03:26.039 --> 03:27.540
but I--I--I just--
I can hear him now

03:27.624 --> 03:28.791
telling me to
just stay out of it

03:28.875 --> 03:30.293
- and let them deal with it.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.796
- Marco! Hi!
- Hey, hey, hey!

03:33.880 --> 03:35.798
- Marco's here!
- Yes.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.967
Hi! I forgot you were coming.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.552
Come meet them.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.513
Annie and Max,
my best friends. Hey.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.974
The legendary Annie and Max.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.352
- Hey.
- Oh. Legendary? Wow.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.811
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.022
I've been working overtime
on a pitch deck

03:51.105 --> 03:52.357
for this new Wally Birch album.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.817
But, uh, no rest
for the weary, right?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.320
I didn't know people said that
in real life.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.781
So they are very jet-lagged
and you look very tired, too.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.658
You look exhausted.
You should go take a shower.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.909
I'll meet you back there,
though, 'kay?

04:02.992 --> 04:04.410
- That's it? Okay.
- Yeah.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.079
- Okay.
- Yeah. You know what I mean.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.372
We're gonna have dinner
tomorrow. We can catch up then.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.665
I'll see you
at dinner tomorrow.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.166
-Yes! Good night!
- Nice to meet you.

04:10.249 --> 04:11.501
-Night night.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.752
I already really like him.
He's like that

04:12.835 --> 04:14.754
cool professor in college
who still smoked weed.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.464
Yeah, well, he's sober,
so that's not what he does.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.174
He's shockingly chill
given the fact

04:18.257 --> 04:19.425
that you were almost blown up
in Berlin.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.593
-- Yeah.
-- Oh, fuck me.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.970
You didn't tell him, did you?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.179
'Course I didn't tell him.
What am I gonna tell him?

04:23.262 --> 04:24.347
I don't want him
to worry about me.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.348
It's a bummer
you're cutting out Marco.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.391
He could definitely handle it.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.226
Okay, you need to calm down.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.145
You met him for five seconds
and you are coming in very hot.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.855
- Times a thousand.
- Guys, reel it in. Come on.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.148
Here's the deal--tomorrow,

04:34.232 --> 04:35.692
Max will work
to identify those slides.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.360
-Yes, 'cause he does bad things.
- Totally.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.028
Which will hopefully
lead us closer

04:39.112 --> 04:40.697
to whoever the fuck
is doing this to you.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.782
- Oh, God.
- But for now, can you please

04:42.865 --> 04:45.076
try and go get some sleep?
Okay?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.563
- My ears are still,
like, ringing.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.568
My ears are still ringing.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.737
Your scarf is, like,
from two years ago.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.447
Scarf, scarf, scarf...
Like, two years ago.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.574
I'm Grace.
I'm not a good person.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.658
I'm not a good person.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.244
My ears are still ringing.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.917
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I think I know who it is.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.610
Okay, I'm awake now.
Tell me your theory.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.154
Okay, so, on my flight
back from Berlin,

06:45.238 --> 06:46.155
there was a new flight
attendant.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.198
Her name was Grace, all right?

06:47.281 --> 06:48.449
She was super cool,
but I don't know,

06:48.533 --> 06:49.909
there's something--unh.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.078
I just feel like she could
be the double.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.497
Good morning.
You need actual hard facts.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.165
All right, here's the thing.
She has short hair.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.042
She'd need a wig.
She is a flight attendant.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.419
She'd have access to my luggage,
to our uniforms.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.588
Um, she said her ears
were ringing,

07:02.672 --> 07:03.798
yet she also said she was

07:03.881 --> 07:05.174
in her room
when the explosion went off.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
Plus she was wearing a scarf
on the flight back.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.220
Remember I was telling you about
the rough sex that I saw,

07:09.303 --> 07:10.429
- Yeah, the sex you described

07:10.513 --> 07:11.848
should definitely leave
some kind of mark.

07:11.931 --> 07:15.226
No, totally, but aren't
the scarves part of the uniform?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.186
No, the airline has changed
uniforms twice since then.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.521
I mean, we're totally updated.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.565
No one even wears them anymore,
but she had it on.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.108
It was very cute,
but I mentioned it,

07:22.191 --> 07:24.652
and she had like a very quick,
way-too-cool of an answer.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.196
- Max, what are you making?
- Spanish tortilla.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.990
-Hey, you think Marco wants one?
- Oh, he already left.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.324
- He leaves early on shoot days.
- Oh.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.286
- Can we discuss the boner
that he has for Marco?

07:33.369 --> 07:34.871
- Seriously.
- Also, what is wrong

07:34.954 --> 07:36.122
with him,
because if you don't tell me

07:36.205 --> 07:37.832
- I'll just dig it up myself.
- Marco?

07:37.915 --> 07:39.000
Nothing's wrong with him.
He's perfect.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.168
- He checks every box.
- Where's salt?

07:40.251 --> 07:41.169
- I need salt.
- What's the problem?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.545
It's right here.
Listen, Annie,

07:42.628 --> 07:44.297
can we please get back
to this list

07:44.380 --> 07:46.007
that I have made, okay?
I mean,

07:46.090 --> 07:48.509
it kind of says that Grace
is the double, right?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.344
I will give you that it is

07:50.428 --> 07:51.762
a compelling argument
that would

07:51.846 --> 07:54.056
- never hold up in court.
- Okay, here's one other thing.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.099
She gave me her address.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.601
Now we're kind of
becoming friendly.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.060
I feel like
maybe I could stop by,

07:58.144 --> 08:00.438
look around, see if anything
looks off.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.148
- Okay, alternate plan.
- Yeah?

08:02.231 --> 08:03.774
I go to the moon
and I build a house,

08:03.858 --> 08:05.985
except there's no oxygen
on the moon, so I fucking die.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.070
Cass, what if she's actually
dangerous?

08:08.154 --> 08:11.157
Listen, I have worked so hard
to build this perfect new life,

08:11.240 --> 08:13.284
and I am holding onto it
with everything that I have.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.786
You're telling me to go
against my gut instinct?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.122
Yes. If you want to hold on
to this perfect, like,

08:18.206 --> 08:21.876
I-have-vegetables-in-the-fridge
life, yes, I am telling you

08:21.959 --> 08:23.753
to ignore
your white-knuckle instincts.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.588
Also, she has an interview
to get ready for.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.965
No, that's--I don't--
that's a dog and pony show.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.508
God, I've been so involved
with my shit,

08:29.592 --> 08:31.052
I totally forgot about
your big interview today!

08:31.135 --> 08:32.553
You're gonna be great,
and even if

08:32.637 --> 08:33.888
it is a dog and pony show,

08:33.971 --> 08:35.223
you're gonna be the
most adorable pony in there.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.350
I am the best fucking pony
that ever there was.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.435
- That is a fact.
- You know what? You're right.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.270
I am not gonna go to Grace's.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.272
It's a really stupid idea.
It's absolutely insane

08:43.356 --> 08:44.607
and you're right,
I'm not gonna do it.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.443
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Wow.

08:47.526 --> 08:48.736
- Yes.
- That is growth,

08:48.819 --> 08:50.279
and I am impressed by it.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.740
I have a bunch of errands to run
before a meeting later,

08:52.823 --> 08:55.201
and I'm also the donut girl
this week, so, that's big,

08:55.284 --> 08:56.953
so I have to stop
and get all the donuts.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.538
Hey, um...

08:59.247 --> 09:00.915
Yeah, I just wanted
to say I'm--I'm--

09:00.998 --> 09:02.792
You know, I'm happy
it timed out that I could--

09:02.875 --> 09:04.794
We could be here for this big
milestone that you're--

09:04.877 --> 09:06.504
- Me, too.
- Okay, you don't--

09:06.587 --> 09:08.756
That's a lot. Okay.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.759
There's always
so much touching.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.315
- Cassie, hey.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.483
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.236
Um, I was just heading
to Abbot Kinney

09:30.319 --> 09:32.738
to--to find a gift
for my boyfriend.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.573
You're near there, right?
Would you want to, like--

09:34.657 --> 09:35.825
Do you want
to come with me, or--

09:35.908 --> 09:38.536
Oh, um, I would actually
love that, yeah,

09:38.619 --> 09:40.579
but, um, I'm kind of
in the middle of

09:40.663 --> 09:42.331
a serious sourdough emergency.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.041
I'm a--I'm a terrible baker.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.502
Wow, you--you bake.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.170
Yes, I bake. Yeah.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.380
But it's cooler than it sounds.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.174
I do it in, like,
a leather dominatrix outfit.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.510
Yeah.
Okay, wow.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.721
Uh, listen, some other time
I'd really love to, okay?

09:57.763 --> 09:58.764
Yeah, for sure.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.558
Good luck with the--
with the baking.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.101
- All right. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.864
Oh, okay, yeah.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.908
Sourdough, my ass.
Fuckin' liar.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.544
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.171
I'm gonna digitize
these slides

10:30.254 --> 10:31.839
and do a reverse image
search online

10:33.466 --> 10:34.550
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.052
And that involves?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.888
Go to your interview.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.306
I have time.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.309
You okay? I thought
you were really excited, right?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.561
I...am...no,
I'm totally excited.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.396
- I'm super excited.
- Okay, cool. Yeah?

10:47.480 --> 10:51.025
I'm super excited to,
you know,

10:51.108 --> 10:52.777
potentially not have to

10:52.860 --> 10:54.653
have you pay
my mortgage anymore.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.030
I told you,
it's not a big deal.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.157
And I appreciate that,
but this whole

10:58.240 --> 11:01.577
me-turning-over-a-new-leaf
thing is built on

11:01.660 --> 11:03.662
slightly shaky ground,
because,

11:03.746 --> 11:06.582
you basically steal money
to support us,

11:06.665 --> 11:08.542
and I love you.
That is not a judgment.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.127
- Yeah.
- But...it's true.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.090
- Come on, what's going on?
- I just mostly

11:14.173 --> 11:15.508
miss being self-sufficient

11:15.591 --> 11:16.926
and, you know,
like, feeling valuable.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.011
All last year when you were
doing that legal aid stuff,

11:19.095 --> 11:21.055
that was helping people.
That shit's value.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.599
Yeah, except I wasn't doing it
to, you know, help those people.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.559
I just did it to make
myself feel better,

11:25.643 --> 11:27.269
because I literally used
to help people

11:27.353 --> 11:28.646
- wash blood off their hands,
- Okay.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.855
So I just feel like
moving to LA

11:29.939 --> 11:31.107
- to become this shiny new
- Okay.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.441
- legal crusader just feels
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.776
- sort of like it's a--
- Okay. Okay.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.111
Like, empty...

11:35.194 --> 11:36.904
- Okay.
- And--and I just, you know,

11:36.987 --> 11:40.074
I'm so happy for Cassie
and she's doing so well

11:40.157 --> 11:41.534
and she's so together here

11:41.617 --> 11:43.160
and all of
these appliances match,

11:43.244 --> 11:44.620
but I just--

11:44.703 --> 11:46.622
I don't know, I'm supposed
to be the together one.

11:46.705 --> 11:50.376
Babe,
she had a menacing toy

11:50.459 --> 11:51.710
and a bloody wig
in that suitcase

11:51.794 --> 11:53.629
and almost got blown up
for the CIA.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.590
Okay, that's fair,
but you get my point.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.801
Right. You think
you've lost your shine?

11:58.884 --> 12:00.886
I'm sorry, you--

12:00.970 --> 12:02.138
you haven't.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.100
You haven't.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.436
You got all the shine.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.963
Well, you were right,
totally right,

12:36.046 --> 12:37.465
about the Comté.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.341
What happened? I thought
you were headed home.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.010
I decided to stay in town
a little longer,

12:41.093 --> 12:42.052
support my sister.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.429
She's having a big day today
so...

12:43.512 --> 12:45.181
I can't believe
it's been a month already.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.018
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.060
So maybe I'll see you
next week?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.187
- I'll be here.
- I will as well.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.272
- Okay.
- So, I'll see you later.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.872
- No.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.207
Oh. Hi!

13:53.290 --> 13:54.833
Hello.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.460
I was looking
for the restaurant.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.836
Does that say "restaurant"?

13:58.879 --> 14:00.089
Yeah.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.967
I didn't even see that.
No. No, it doesn't.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.218
You want to head up
the stairs.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.928
Yes. I'm actually late
for a reservation.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.179
Thank you, sir.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.782
Hi. Those are
some cool binoculars.

14:26.865 --> 14:27.783
Thanks.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.660
- They're mine.
- Yes, of course.

14:29.743 --> 14:30.995
Listen,
my name is Alessandra.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.539
I'm an, uh,
efficiency consultant

14:33.622 --> 14:35.207
for this airport,
and would you believe it?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.750
I forgot my binoculars.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.044
Do you think I could borrow
yours just for a second?

14:39.753 --> 14:41.547
I'm so sorry.
She's an only child.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.966
- Yeah, I get it. So am I.
- Sweetie, remember?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.385
We talked about when you share
your toys with friends,

14:46.468 --> 14:47.970
everyone gets to have fun?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.388
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you!

14:49.471 --> 14:50.639
I'll bring 'em right back.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.391
- Don't break them.
- I won't break them.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.161
Excuse me.
Are you gonna order?

15:12.244 --> 15:13.996
Oh, yeah.
Can I see a menu?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.164
So hungry.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.008
Ms. Mouradian?

15:26.091 --> 15:27.843
They're ready now.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.347
Thanks for making the trip
out to Los Angeles, Annie.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.140
Thank you for considering me.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.683
I--I really hope that
this is a fit.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.352
We do, too.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.021
As I'm sure you noted
in your preliminary interview,

15:39.104 --> 15:41.815
we do things here
a bit unconventionally.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.485
Yes! We, you know,
did things unconventionally

15:44.568 --> 15:45.861
at Davis & Carlisle, too.
We just,

15:45.944 --> 15:47.196
you know, paid people
a lot of money

15:47.279 --> 15:49.406
to look the other way
while we were doing it.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.077
I mean, not, um--

15:53.160 --> 15:55.996
that sounded like bribery.
Not bribery, obviously.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.164
Um...

15:57.247 --> 15:58.332
I was kidding.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.125
- Though, it's...
- Of course.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.711
Yeah. He gets it.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.546
Oh, I see you're engaged.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.674
Lovely ring.
When's the big date?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.551
Oh, um, no.
Um...yeah, no.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.346
This is just a ring.
That's not, um--

16:12.429 --> 16:14.556
Also, it's illegal for you
to ask me that question.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.683
So...

16:15.766 --> 16:18.143
I was ki--um...

16:18.227 --> 16:19.728
kidding again.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.979
Let's just skip
the formalities

16:21.063 --> 16:23.107
- and jump to the fun part.
- Great. Great.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.567
Um, we thought
doing some hypotheticals

16:25.651 --> 16:27.778
might be an exciting way
to gauge your best practices.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.113
Super, yeah.

16:29.196 --> 16:32.408
Um, yeah, no,
I don't make it to trial much.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.494
I normally find a way
to shut it down pretty early.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.996
Just put the kibosh on it,
you know what I mean?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.165
I'd say in that scenario,

16:40.249 --> 16:42.584
one call from a burner phone
to his house after midnight

16:42.668 --> 16:43.502
would probably do the trick.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.671
I'm not advocating arson.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.631
Arson's illegal. Um...

16:47.715 --> 16:48.757
You say blackmail...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.634
I say misunderstanding.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.511
Obviously I'm not saying
I hate a dolphin.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.263
I don't hate dolphins.
I'm just trying

16:54.346 --> 16:56.598
to state the obvious.
Um...

17:04.022 --> 17:06.442
Hi. Sorry I'm late,
but there was a line.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.068
- It was a whole thing.
- Oh, you're not late.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.528
In fact, you're early.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.989
- That's a lot of donuts.
- Well, we ran out last time

17:12.072 --> 17:13.073
I wanted to make sure
we had enough, so...

17:13.157 --> 17:14.700
That's so generous of you.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.244
I've also brought you
a one-year anniversary cake.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.955
Because secretly,
I care a lot about you.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.206
- Oh.
- So there will be

17:21.290 --> 17:22.666
no shortage of sugar.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.461
Also, my--my brother's coming
and my boyfriend and...

17:25.544 --> 17:27.504
It's an open meeting.
Everyone's welcome.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.631
It's good you have a family
who are invested.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.716
- Yeah.
- My family

17:30.799 --> 17:32.926
only ever gave me
a restraining order.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.803
- What?
- Oh, that's a lot of donuts.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.139
Hi. Speaking of.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.515
Hi, I'm Brenda,

17:38.599 --> 17:40.976
and I'm taking these
donuts away from her.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.311
I'm Davey.
I'm Cassie's brother.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.230
Oh, nice to meet you.
You two grab seats.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.025
I'll take care of this
complete donut onslaught.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.943
- Thank you.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.278
Hi.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.572
Hey, did I see you today
at the farmers market?

17:53.655 --> 17:56.325
What? No. Why would I go
to a farmers market?

17:56.408 --> 17:58.035
That's what I thought.
There was someone

17:58.118 --> 18:00.078
- who looked exactly like you.
- Oh, only it wasn't me.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.663
Listen, thank you
for being here for me

18:01.747 --> 18:04.416
- and what is this? Why?
- Just a little gift.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.668
You really shouldn't have
gotten me anything.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.961
What, are you looking for
someone better to sit with?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.671
- Come on!
- No.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.923
Okay, you don't really
do gifts here.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.341
That's not really, like,
what we do.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.510
I know, but no one here
has a brother as nice as me.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.762
- I set the bar pretty high.
- Okay, fine.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.851
Okay, there's
a surprise to it.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.061
- Mm-hmm.
- You have to press the paw.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.230
- That paw.
- Okay.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.232
Easy does it!

18:28.315 --> 18:29.733
Oh, my God,
is that your voice?

18:29.817 --> 18:32.236
- Oh, Davey.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.405
I love it.
It's so weird.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.866
But I love it.
And I love you. Thank you.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.536
- Thank you.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.204
So are you gonna, like,
fly back later

18:42.287 --> 18:43.455
- or what is your plan?
- Whoa.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.332
- You trying to get rid of me?
- No!

18:45.415 --> 18:47.084
No, I just think
that Rick and the girls

18:47.167 --> 18:48.210
probably really miss you.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.545
I FaceTime with them
every night.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.297
Oh, my God,
is this your brother?

18:52.381 --> 18:54.091
Uh, yeah, hey.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.717
Hey, I'm Jenny.
We met last week.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.387
- Yeah, we did. Davey.
- I'm a hugger.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.888
Oh, hi.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.974
I think the meeting's
gonna start, so let's just--

19:02.057 --> 19:04.560
Oh, wait, Cassie.
Look. I bought the necklace.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.103
- You did.
- Ladybug twins.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.229
Oh, it's nice.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.106
And my boyfriend
does totally love it.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.482
Oh, that's good.
It looks cute on you.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.900
- Thanks.
- So.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.402
- Yeah.
- That's fun.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.987
- Okay.
- Welcome, everyone.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.239
Thank you for joining
today's open meeting.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.283
How about we start
with some introductions?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.368
I'm Meryl,
and I'm an alcoholic.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.828
Hi, Meryl.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.831
Hi, my name is Romero,
and I'm an alcoholic.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.791
-Hi, Romero.
- Hi, I'm Donna,

19:27.875 --> 19:29.251
and I'm an alcoholic.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.587
-Hi, Donna.
- Hi, everyone.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.423
I'm Brenda,
and I'm an alcoholic.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.425
Hi, Brenda.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.262
And I'm also your friendly
neighborhood chip person.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.014
I'm just gonna take
a couple of photos.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.683
It's anonymous.
Put your phone away.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.476
Anyone have 24 hours?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.147
One week?

19:50.230 --> 19:51.273
One month?

19:52.316 --> 19:54.026
Three months?

19:54.109 --> 19:55.152
Nine months?

19:56.820 --> 19:58.363
Do I hear one year?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.118
Cassie, alcoholic.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.703
Hi, Cassie.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.542
Hi. Um...

20:10.626 --> 20:12.920
Can't believe it's been a year.
Wow, I did not...

20:13.962 --> 20:15.297
think that would happen.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.424
I just want to thank
a couple people that helped me

20:17.507 --> 20:18.634
this past year. Um...

20:18.717 --> 20:21.887
My brother,
who's the one crying.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.764
Uh, no, seriously, thank you.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.765
You're the best brother
in the world,

20:24.848 --> 20:27.809
so thanks for being here
for me.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.062
My sponsor Brenda.
You're the best ever.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.313
Thank you for everything.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.316
And lastly,
when I first started

20:34.399 --> 20:36.443
trying to get sober
I was, like, trying to prove,

20:36.526 --> 20:40.822
it was like this new me, and
I met this, like, amazing Marco.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.992
And I'm just so glad that
I took that chance with you,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.619
so thank you.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.667
Mm, well.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.544
That was fucking beautiful.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.340
No, no, no, no.
I don't want to be here.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.883
This is an important moment
for me, okay?

20:59.967 --> 21:02.094
- I earned that chip.
- Uch, the self-indulgent

21:02.177 --> 21:04.221
blah blah "thanks
for your support" crap again?

21:04.304 --> 21:06.056
- It's such a farce.
- No it's not.

21:06.139 --> 21:10.477
Okay, 365 consecutive
days of sobriety. Right.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.562
I'm just so grateful
for these donuts.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.147
Yeah, well,
I'm grateful to be alive

21:14.231 --> 21:15.983
and to not be you anymore,
so there's that.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.567
Wow. Real nice.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.361
Kid, we always knew
you were a liar,

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
but did you know you were gonna
grow up and be this boring?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.865
I mean, not really.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.033
Sorry.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.997
-Keep it up.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.457
- One day at a time.
- Yeah, thank you.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.961
-Whoo!

21:43.468 --> 21:45.387
You should be proud.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.555
I've got a drawer full of those,

21:46.638 --> 21:48.390
and it's still special,
but one year?

21:48.473 --> 21:51.309
That meant the most to me,
until the next one.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.270
And the next one.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.730
Yeah, you're right.
I am proud.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.531
How is the letter to your dad
coming along?

22:04.614 --> 22:06.324
Do you have to ask me
that right now?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.493
-Isn't your trip home coming up?
- Yes, and the trip is

22:08.577 --> 22:10.245
coming up soon,
so I need to finish it soon.

22:10.328 --> 22:12.956
I think visiting my dad's
grave's gonna be hard enough.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.499
Plus Davey, like,
has a schedule.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.084
He planned every second
of this trip.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.587
He's really doing a lot
for you.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.464
Is that from him?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.758
- Yes.
- Oh, so cute!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.760
Easy does it!

22:26.636 --> 22:29.264
Your sister was just saying
how grateful she is

22:29.347 --> 22:30.724
for all you're doing for her.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.768
Just so glad she's finally
knocking this out.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.186
We can do this, right?

22:34.269 --> 22:37.230
My kids were
very involved with my sobriety.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.942
Al-Anon was a big help.
Have you looked into it?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.444
- No.
- Congratulations, Cassie.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.529
One whole year?
Wow, that's so awesome.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.698
- You must be super proud.
- Definitely proud.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.411
Excuse me, I gotta take this.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.719
Hey, sorry.
This was my friend from work.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.054
I totally forgot we're studying

23:09.137 --> 23:10.472
for this
recertification thing.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.015
- Oh, okay.
- So, I'm gonna have to go,

23:12.099 --> 23:13.308
but will you meet us
for dinner tonight?

23:13.391 --> 23:15.143
Oh, I don't--I don't want
to be a fifth wheel

23:15.227 --> 23:16.603
I gotta FaceTime
with the girls,

23:16.686 --> 23:19.147
and Jenny offered to take me
to her favorite restaurant.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.440
He said he was new in town,
and I was like,

23:20.524 --> 23:21.858
"Oh, my God! I have recs."

23:21.942 --> 23:24.027
Oh, my God, I was gone
for two seconds.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.279
- You move fast.
- And we talked about

23:26.363 --> 23:28.782
us all going whale watching,
which would be so much fun.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.950
You can totally come
if you want.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.159
- It's super fun, you--
- Okay, great.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.994
Cool. Have fun.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.413
- See you later.
- Bye.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.885
Just go inside.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.262
How else are you gonna know
if she's the one?

23:50.345 --> 23:51.847
Just give me a minute.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.683
Just go inside.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.017
You know we're going to anyway.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.270
Everything we do
ends up a fucking disaster.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.522
Are you serious?
What the fuck?

24:00.605 --> 24:01.731
Who the hell is that?

24:01.815 --> 24:02.941
That is a black hole of joy.

24:03.024 --> 24:03.859
I'm the only one
you want to talk to.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.360
She's fucking depressing.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.195
You could at least whisper
if you're gonna talk shit.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.197
No! I want you to hear me.
You make me sad,

24:09.281 --> 24:10.866
plus you need to wipe off
that eye makeup, girl.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.075
Okay, hey,
enough of this bullshit.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.451
Before it starts, okay, stop.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.786
I don't need you trying
to push me off a cliff

24:14.870 --> 24:16.121
and I don't need you--me--you!

24:16.204 --> 24:18.039
This--I don't need
this attitude.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.207
No, uh-uh.
No, I'm leaving.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.550
- Hi. Hey, come on in.
- Hi!

24:28.633 --> 24:30.135
- Cool. Wow.
- Sorry.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.095
I'm, like, a total mess.
I just got into a workout.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.139
- Oh, no.
- Come on in.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.517
Thank you. Um, did you settle
your bread emergency?

24:37.601 --> 24:39.227
I did, yes.
Thank you for asking.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.687
Yes, of course.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.565
Hey, question.
Um, how are your ears?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.025
Mine are still ringing
like crazy

24:45.108 --> 24:47.569
- ever since that explosion.
- Uh, mine have been fine.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.070
Yeah, they bothered me
a bit the next day

24:49.154 --> 24:51.364
but I wasn't standing
very close to whatever happened.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.199
- So...
- Oh.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.577
Wow. Your bread looks perfect.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.412
- It looks fake.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.955
It's a fucking
pain in the ass.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.208
- Thank you.
- Prost.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.626
Yeah, prost, thanks.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.922
Do you not like rosé?
I didn't even ask you

25:07.005 --> 25:08.256
what you wanted, I'm sorry.
I'm the worst.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.426
Oh, my God, no, no, no.
I--I--I like rosé.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.428
- Okay, good.
- So, yeah.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.766
- This is my...
- Wow, cool place.

25:17.849 --> 25:21.102
Oh, my God. What--hi!
Nice sword.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.437
That's actually not a sword.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.897
That's a ceremonial shamshir.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.398
- Obviously.
- Yeah, I got that

25:25.482 --> 25:26.858
in my time in Fallujah.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.902
I was in the army,
like, very briefly.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.612
- Oh.
- Yeah, before I realized that

25:30.695 --> 25:32.530
mu version of saving the world
and the army's version

25:32.614 --> 25:34.741
didn't really line up.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.327
So did you just, like, take it
or someone gave it to you?

25:37.410 --> 25:39.079
We were destroying
an entire civilization,

25:39.162 --> 25:40.413
so I didn't think
anybody would miss it.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.957
- Right.
- And I was--I was young.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.583
- I was stupid, but...
- Whoa.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.961
That's a--that's--wow.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.463
You've got some really cool
stuff in here.

25:48.546 --> 25:51.299
- Oh, there's...
- Yes. This is me.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.635
I keep that to remind myself
that people come and go

25:53.718 --> 25:55.887
and the only person you can
really trust is yourself.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.347
How's that for upbeat?

25:57.430 --> 25:58.640
No, it's--it's good.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.809
- It's good.
- Um, look, I'm disgusting.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.060
You don't mind if I, like,

26:02.143 --> 26:03.561
take a really quick shower,
do you?

26:03.645 --> 26:05.146
No. Go. Of course, go.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.398
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.317
I'll just--
I'll just, um...yeah.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.486
By the way, I'm really
glad that you called.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.989
You'd be amazed how many times
people say they want to chill

26:14.072 --> 26:16.074
and then they just, like,
never call.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.909
- Yeah, no, me, too. Me, too.
- Yeah.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.789
Drink up. It's fine.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.624
Unless you're a soccer mom
at brunch,

26:24.708 --> 26:26.293
rosé won't affect you at all.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.169
Come on, it's just you, me,

26:28.253 --> 26:31.131
and 365 days of sobriety.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.008
Who's even gonna know?

26:33.091 --> 26:34.801
Stop saying it like that.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.429
Oh, my God,
you're so not fun.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.515
Do I smell Santal 33?

26:41.558 --> 26:42.726
Hmm.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.603
Okay, you gotta--
you gotta go.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.356
You gotta go away.
Right here.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.524
- Just gonna...

26:49.607 --> 26:51.860
I should win a medal
for that. Jesus.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.909
So now you're just creepy.
Yeah, okay.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.136
Lollypops? What the fuck?

28:00.220 --> 28:02.430
What flavor are these?

28:07.519 --> 28:08.561
- Hi.
- Aah!

28:08.645 --> 28:10.438
- Hey!
- Hey, you found my side hustle.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.190
No. Yeah.
I mean, are you--

28:12.273 --> 28:14.234
Are you selling candy
door-to-door?

28:14.317 --> 28:15.652
- That's good, but,

28:15.735 --> 28:17.946
no, they're medical grade
fentanyl lollypops.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.447
Oh!

28:19.531 --> 28:21.950
Oh, so you're a--
you're a--a drug dealer.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.785
Um...yeah, kind of.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.246
Hey, look, Cassie,
the world's a fucked up place.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.956
There's people
that really need drugs

28:28.039 --> 28:29.541
and they have no access to them,

28:29.624 --> 28:30.875
and they wake up
in the morning

28:30.959 --> 28:32.585
and they just feel,
like, stuck and they're in pain.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.087
They don't want
to get out of bed.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.922
So I guess, the way I see it
I play, like,

28:36.005 --> 28:38.925
they fentanyl fairy godperson

28:39.008 --> 28:40.218
to deserving cancer patients.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.719
Fuck the pharmaceutical
industry.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.680
Honestly, sometimes you have
to, like, break the system,

28:43.763 --> 28:45.640
you know what I mean?

28:45.723 --> 28:49.185
Yeah. Wow.
Um, that's--that's amazing.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.521
You're--you're amazing.
That's so nice.

28:51.604 --> 28:53.815
Um, so sor--
I just realized I forgot

28:53.898 --> 28:56.151
I'm volunteering at
the animal shelter, right now!

28:56.234 --> 28:57.777
- You do that?
- Yeah.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.654
- Really?
- Yeah, the bunny rescue?

28:59.737 --> 29:01.156
They don't have a lot of help,
so I try to get in there...

29:01.239 --> 29:02.907
Yeah, I know.
I get it. I get it.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.742
I was gonna make dinner,
but, another time.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.412
Definitely. And thank you
for the rosé. It was so good.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.414
I'll--I'll--
I'll see you at work.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.623
Okay.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.669
I mean, I'm so glad
we're doing this.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.713
Me, too.
I've been working so hard

29:16.796 --> 29:18.715
on my new podcast, it's just
been really isolating.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.758
I love podcasts.
What's it about?

29:22.177 --> 29:23.636
God, I kind of don't want
to tell you.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.513
Why?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.141
No, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.351
It's a murder podcast.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.854
It's a true crime podcast
about ordinary people

29:32.937 --> 29:34.939
who find themselves
in deadly situations

29:35.023 --> 29:36.566
and I was just thinking...

29:37.734 --> 29:39.611
you'd be such a perfect guest.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.362
Me? Why...wait, what?

29:41.446 --> 29:44.407
Well, I just find Cassie's
whole situation so fascinating.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.494
I mean, waking up next to a
dead body in a foreign country.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.620
Oh.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.664
Oh.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.790
If you're just having lunch
with me

29:52.874 --> 29:53.917
to get some gossip
about my sister,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.960
that makes me just
really uncomfortable.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.545
Oh, my God, no!
No, no, no, no.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.922
No, Davey, I just thought

29:59.005 --> 30:01.633
you were so fun at the meeting,
and then...

30:01.716 --> 30:04.135
sitting here just now,
I was thinking,

30:04.219 --> 30:05.637
you know...

30:06.721 --> 30:08.014
What?

30:08.097 --> 30:11.893
Cassie may have woken up
next to a dead body, but...

30:11.976 --> 30:14.312
I can't imagine what it
must've been like for you.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.443
Sorry.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.070
I've just been really stressed.
My husband and I

30:22.153 --> 30:24.656
have been going through
some stuff, and, uh...

30:25.448 --> 30:26.908
You know, what Cassie's
been going through,

30:26.991 --> 30:29.327
that's--you know,
that's the priority, you know.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.246
Well, if you ever need
someone to talk to.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.497
I mean...

30:33.581 --> 30:35.291
...if it feels okay with you.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.586
Thank you.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.642
Be careful!
Those could be Steinkrympill.

30:52.725 --> 30:53.935
They could be deadly.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.020
Sorry, didn't mean
to startle you.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.107
My advice?
Buy what you need at the market.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.358
It's not worth the risk.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.235
Thank you for warning me.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.570
I had no idea.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.698
Thanks again.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.976
Hey.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.061
Hey.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.563
Are you ready?

31:40.356 --> 31:41.649
Oh, wait, wait.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.757
Megan, come dance with me.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.304
Please? Just one.

32:18.144 --> 32:21.314
- Hmm. Wow.

32:21.397 --> 32:24.233
You look really pretty
tonight.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.735
Thank you.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.503
Hey.
How was your interview?

32:43.586 --> 32:46.005
Uh, imagine
the worst date ever,

32:46.089 --> 32:47.507
and then set it on fire.

32:47.590 --> 32:48.716
- What?
- Did you, um,

32:48.800 --> 32:50.259
find anything out about these

32:50.343 --> 32:52.845
super-abstract-yet-somehow-
ultra-generic slides?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.138
Wait, hold up. Back it up.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.682
It couldn't have been that bad.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.642
It was cringe-inducingly
abhorrent

32:57.725 --> 32:59.644
and I don't really
want to talk about it.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.229
So.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.647
Okay.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.485
I'm gonna say generally,
you're amazing,

33:07.568 --> 33:09.445
and that generally they'd be
stupid not to hire you

33:09.529 --> 33:10.571
even if you set the entire
building on fire.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.490
Okay, generally, thank you.

33:12.573 --> 33:13.616
Okay.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.744
I might have some news
to cheer you up.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.955
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.249
So, this is the second slide
from the View-Master.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.667
Bam.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.752
It's an extreme close-up
of a plaque

33:24.836 --> 33:26.587
at the base of the
Lady of the Lake statue

33:26.671 --> 33:27.839
at Echo Park Lake.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.340
Boom.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.092
Which is in LA?

33:31.175 --> 33:32.760
Yeah, babe,
Echo Park is in LA.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.304
Okay, don't act like everyone
knows that Echo Park is in LA.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.014
Right, yep.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.349
Okay, I'm texting Cassie
right now

33:38.433 --> 33:40.226
and telling her to meet us
there.

33:40.309 --> 33:41.436
Yes!

33:54.699 --> 33:55.783
Hell...

33:55.867 --> 33:56.743
yes.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.327
Bam, see? I told you.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.121
This slide is the plaque
at the base

34:00.204 --> 34:02.582
of the Lady of the Lake
statue right there.

34:02.665 --> 34:03.958
For whatever reason,
the View-Master

34:04.041 --> 34:05.501
singled out this location.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.586
Yeah, but you're the first
person we've seen

34:06.669 --> 34:07.795
that looks even remotely
like you,

34:07.879 --> 34:09.047
for whatever that means.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.339
So what are we supposed to do?

34:10.423 --> 34:11.799
Just stand here and wait
for something to happen?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.968
I mean, there's normal people
doing normal things

34:14.051 --> 34:14.927
- all over the plac--

34:15.011 --> 34:16.637
- Ow!
-Oh, my God!

34:16.721 --> 34:18.639
- Ah!

34:18.723 --> 34:20.808
-Hey!

34:20.892 --> 34:23.561
Yo, you might want to stay away
from those fucking kids

34:23.644 --> 34:25.396
after you just had
your eardrums blown out.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.565
I did not see the kids
until it was too late.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.275
And you know what?
I'm done taking advice from you.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.860
Okay? You sent me
on a dead end with Grace

34:30.943 --> 34:32.320
so fuck off!

34:32.403 --> 34:33.988
I didn't make Grace
not the culprit.

34:34.071 --> 34:36.074
It's not my fault you went
on a wild goose chase.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.159
Plus, you have your own legs
that you control.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.660
You took 'em all over
Santa Monica.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.120
Well, you've been shouting
at me all day,

34:41.204 --> 34:42.497
"Follow Grace, follow Grace,"
and guess what?

34:42.580 --> 34:44.499
I did, and it's not her,
so now it could be anyone,

34:44.582 --> 34:45.958
and I'm really scared.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.251
I'm really fucking scared!

34:49.378 --> 34:51.172
Wow.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.591
We're really gonna fuck this
whole thing up, aren't we?

34:54.884 --> 34:57.512
- Yo, Cass, are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.889
Sorry, tinnitus
from that fucking explosion

34:59.972 --> 35:01.599
- is still messing me up.
- Okay, well, do you want me

35:01.682 --> 35:02.934
to go murder
those kids with the air horns?

35:03.017 --> 35:04.268
'Cause I could totally
take them.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.020
And she can run really fast
when the cops come.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.688
- She'll just be out of there.
- Thank you.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.274
Let's save that for later
and focus on this,

35:10.358 --> 35:11.359
this weird slide.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.693
Well, I guess that's the trick.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.612
Even if we crack all the slides,
we still...

35:14.695 --> 35:17.698
- have no idea what they mean.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.116
-It's the truth.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.702
- Yeah.
- God damn it.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.454
-See that, babe?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.039
- I see. I know.
- See that?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.458
- You did a very good job.
- Thank you.

35:32.004 --> 35:35.049
Ooh, la la!
Cali pasta tonight.

35:35.132 --> 35:37.885
-- Hmm? What?
-- Cali pasta!

35:37.969 --> 35:40.888
First off, "ooh, la, la"
is gonna be my new catchphrase.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.223
Please don't copy
things he does.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.558
- Thank you. Ooh, la, la.
-No. Oh, my God.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.018
Second,
I'd like to make a toast.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.855
It's only a "nojito,"
but, um, what can I do?

35:48.938 --> 35:51.566
To Annie and Max,
congrats on your engagement.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.734
- It's a beautiful ring.
-Aww.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.236
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.780
That's very sweet,
but, uh, just...

35:57.864 --> 35:59.365
because I'm wearing the ring
does not mean

35:59.448 --> 36:00.992
that we are officially
engaged yet.

36:01.075 --> 36:03.286
Oh, my goodness, calm down.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.912
That's a real hot take
on engagements right there.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.247
I mean, what can I say?
I'm an original.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.416
You are an original.
I will give you that.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.834
Thank you.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.795
Um, and I would also

36:12.879 --> 36:15.506
like to make a toast
to Cassie and Marco,

36:15.590 --> 36:17.592
the longest relationship
you have ever been in

36:17.675 --> 36:19.760
since I've known you.
I think that this is

36:19.844 --> 36:21.596
a six-month record breaker.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.307
- Has it really been six months?
- I think so.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.101
Can you believe it?

36:27.184 --> 36:29.186
Oh, my God! I forgot to ask
about your interview!

36:29.270 --> 36:30.730
- How did it go?
- It's not really fun,

36:30.813 --> 36:31.898
dinner table conversation.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.608
-It's more like obituary fodder.
- What?

36:33.691 --> 36:35.610
It was fine. They're just
not sure if they can afford her.

36:35.693 --> 36:36.861
- That's all.
- Yeah, no, I bombed.

36:36.944 --> 36:37.945
But how was your day?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.322
'Cause you did the--
the chip thing.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.365
Right? Or can--can I--
am I allowed to ask that?

36:41.449 --> 36:43.618
Oh, you should have seen her.
A real pro.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.620
I did the chip thing, yes.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.331
Um, I was also on donut duty,
which is a very big deal.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.749
- Yeah, um,

36:49.832 --> 36:53.544
and, um, then I just kind of
walked around Santa Monica

36:53.628 --> 36:54.545
and...

36:58.215 --> 37:01.636
Then I went and hung out
with my new friend Grace,

37:01.719 --> 37:05.139
who is a very interesting
new friend.

37:05.222 --> 37:06.724
So...

37:06.807 --> 37:10.311
Um, Cass, I need to see you
in the bathroom right now.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.145
Right now.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.231
All right, well, first of all,
you were right.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.816
- Marco is literal perfection.
- Yes.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.401
Yes, on paper, he is
the perfect guy, isn't he?

37:17.485 --> 37:20.488
Wow. "On paper"?
That's, um, not exactly

37:20.571 --> 37:21.989
- the height of enthusiasm.
- Okay, you know what?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.950
You think Max is amazing
and you have yet to admit

37:24.033 --> 37:25.201
you're wearing
an engagement ring.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.911
- That is different.
- Sorry. I just--

37:26.994 --> 37:28.996
I'm having a hard time
focusing on anything other

37:29.080 --> 37:31.248
than this crazy mystery,
creepy person.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.751
Okay, okay, look. Love shit
aside, you want to tell me

37:33.834 --> 37:35.962
why the fuck you went to Grace's
after you fully admitted

37:36.045 --> 37:37.338
you thought she was
potentially a murderer?

37:37.421 --> 37:39.465
Annie, it's me. Did you really
think I wasn't gonna go?

37:39.548 --> 37:41.008
Everyone knew I was gonna
go to Grace's!

37:41.092 --> 37:42.301
Everyone did not know
you were gonna to go Grace's.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.136
- Well, I went!
- Okay, fuck! Fine.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.846
You went. Did you at least
find anything good out?

37:45.930 --> 37:47.515
No. I saw her in the shower.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.558
Not like that, no.
I was looking,

37:49.642 --> 37:51.352
no tattoo, no bruises.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.522
I could not find the matching
perfume. I smelled all of them.

37:54.605 --> 37:55.982
She doesn't have
the crazy vibe!

37:56.065 --> 37:58.192
She's, like, super cool
and she's, like, helping people

37:58.275 --> 37:59.568
and she bakes bread.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.405
- Like, from scratch?
- Yes. It was perfect-looking.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.365
- That's so LA.
- Mm-hmm.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.076
Okay, look, it sounds like
we're barking up the wrong tree.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.078
And I don't know, this
whole thing from the beginning

38:09.161 --> 38:11.038
- has just been like...
- Annie, look, I know today was,

38:11.122 --> 38:12.873
like, such a long shot
but I desperately needed it

38:12.957 --> 38:15.084
to be Grace so I could just
look her in the eye

38:15.167 --> 38:17.712
and say "Why me? Isn't there
anyone else in this world

38:17.795 --> 38:20.131
you could fuck with?"
But now, it could be anyone.

38:20.214 --> 38:22.341
- Literally anyone!
- You need to simmer down.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.884
I know that this is
freaky as fuck,

38:23.968 --> 38:26.220
but we have options.
We still have the View-Master.

38:26.303 --> 38:28.389
Even if we figure out the rest
of the pictures on that thing,

38:28.472 --> 38:30.057
we have to figure out
what they actually mean.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.059
I feel like I am
just standing here

38:32.143 --> 38:33.394
waiting for something
terrible to happen.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.146
I have to do something!
I can't--

38:35.229 --> 38:36.772
Shh! You are not gonna
do anything.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.733
That is always a bad move
on your part

38:38.816 --> 38:41.902
and sadly, this is kind of
where we're at,

38:41.986 --> 38:44.572
at the moment, but look.
We are here, okay?

38:44.655 --> 38:46.323
You have Max, you have me.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.409
We are not going anywhere,
and...

38:49.660 --> 38:50.995
I don't know,
we're gonna figure it out.

38:52.538 --> 38:53.748
Okay. Okay.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.250
Look, we don't--we don't
always have to hug.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.793
We can just--

38:57.877 --> 38:58.794
I don't want
to make this weird,

38:58.878 --> 39:00.963
but you're, like, really cool.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.132
Aw, thank you, man.

39:03.215 --> 39:04.425
Thank you,
that means a lot, man.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.886
- You got it.
- I was a fucking train wreck.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.680
Lost a wife.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.932
Get a few visits a year
with my daughter, so,

39:12.016 --> 39:14.769
it's cool that you think
I'm cool, but, uh...

39:14.852 --> 39:18.022
it was a lot of work
to just...be.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.815
Wow.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.193
I mean, just...wow.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.403
Anyway, tell me about Annie,
because the...

39:24.487 --> 39:25.863
the engagement thing?

39:27.364 --> 39:30.618
Yeah, Annie's...
she's tricky.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.454
She's the most amazing
person I know,

39:33.537 --> 39:35.498
and I'm really excited for her
to meet my folks tomorrow,

39:35.581 --> 39:37.833
but don't tell her I said that.
I'm downplaying it.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.003
But Annie, she's...

39:41.087 --> 39:42.922
she's like an octopus.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.008
She's skittish. Smart.
Always has an escape plan.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.635
- Yeah.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.303
- That's good.
- Yeah.

39:49.386 --> 39:50.763
Hey, I've been downplaying

39:50.846 --> 39:53.933
the whole six-month thing
with Cassie, too, but,

39:54.016 --> 39:57.061
after hearing her talk tonight,
I'm thinking...

39:57.144 --> 39:59.230
you know, maybe I don't
need to...

39:59.313 --> 40:00.815
tiptoe around anything.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.316
- You know?
- Yeah.

40:02.399 --> 40:04.151
Go for it.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.573
So, um, I've been thinking
about us and the whole

40:09.657 --> 40:11.659
- six month thing and...
- Yeah?

40:11.742 --> 40:12.993
It's kind of a big deal.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.328
- You know?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

40:14.411 --> 40:16.455
I mean, I know this might
seem a little fast,

40:16.539 --> 40:20.167
but I--I--I was thinking
that maybe...

40:20.251 --> 40:22.461
you know, maybe we should
move in together.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.089
Not--not--not like tomorrow
or anything, but...

40:26.132 --> 40:28.968
Um, yeah. Um, uh...

40:29.051 --> 40:30.970
What about when your daughter
visits and that whole thing?

40:31.053 --> 40:32.179
Well, yeah,
you'd be there, too,

40:32.263 --> 40:33.722
and, you know,
you'd get to know each other.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.683
You're an important part
of my life.

40:35.766 --> 40:40.020
Uh, yes. That's--we should
keep talking about that and

40:40.104 --> 40:41.522
- really, it's a good thing

40:41.605 --> 40:43.983
- to think about, and, um,

40:44.066 --> 40:46.819
This is a weird number and
I feel like I should take it,

40:46.902 --> 40:49.405
- so sorry, babe, just one sec.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:49.488 --> 40:52.825
- Hello?
- Hey. It's, uh, Eli Briscoe.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.535
Megan's son?

40:54.618 --> 40:56.036
Eli. Oh, my God,
is everything okay?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.414
Um, look, I--I--
I haven't heard from...

40:58.497 --> 41:01.876
my mom in like a year.

41:01.959 --> 41:05.421
And, uh, tonight she Snapchatted
me this insane message.

41:05.504 --> 41:06.463
I'm gonna send it to you now,

41:06.547 --> 41:07.882
'cause she said to send
it to you.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.383
Megan Briscoe used Snapchat?

41:09.466 --> 41:10.384
Okay, that really
can't be good.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.595
Um...

41:12.678 --> 41:14.471
Okay, this is weird.

41:16.473 --> 41:17.308
I mean,
I tried to Snap her back

41:17.391 --> 41:18.851
but the account was disabled.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.394
- If she's--
- Okay, listen, Eli,

41:20.477 --> 41:21.896
your mom loves you more
than anything in the world.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.064
I will do everything I can
to make sure this is okay.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.400
I will take care of it,
I promise, okay?

41:26.483 --> 41:28.027
I hope so.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.653
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.622
- Sorry, just--
- We're sorry.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.081
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

41:41.165 --> 41:43.334
or is no longer in service.
Please hang up

41:43.417 --> 41:45.252
- and try your call again.
- Fuck.

41:47.421 --> 41:48.839
But that's where it is.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.299
-The minutiae is all the
details. - I don't--but I
don't--

41:50.382 --> 41:51.425
But I don't want to know
about that.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.260
- Takes away the magic.
- Hey.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.596
Hey. Can I help you?

41:55.679 --> 41:57.681
Oh, shit. Ha!

41:57.765 --> 41:59.433
This isn't my place,
is it?

41:59.516 --> 42:01.101
Yeah, that's why
the door is locked.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.562
No, no, of course.
Sorry. Sorry. I just--

42:03.646 --> 42:05.689
All these places,
they look the same.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.942
-Yeah.
-I can't believe I did it again.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.818
I'm sorry, I'm Esteban Diaz.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.362
Me and my wife Gabrielle
are Airbnbing

42:11.445 --> 42:13.197
the place across the way

42:13.280 --> 42:14.615
-Uh-huh.

42:14.698 --> 42:16.617
- Wrong apartment again, babe?
- I did it again!

42:16.700 --> 42:17.868
Can you believe it?

42:17.952 --> 42:18.911
- Sorry.

42:18.994 --> 42:20.538
Mr. Waffles! Come here.

42:20.621 --> 42:21.997
- Sorry.

42:22.081 --> 42:25.042
Hi. I'm Annie, this is Max.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.126
Nice to meet you.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.545
Hey, I'm Esteban.
That's Gabrielle.

42:28.629 --> 42:30.714
And that's Mr. Waffles.
We'll do our best

42:30.798 --> 42:32.883
- to keep him under control.
- Mr. Waffles!

42:33.968 --> 42:34.969
Bad boy.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.095
As you can see,
he's a bit of a handful.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.930
Uh, I can see that.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.558
Are you guys doing
the Airbnb thing, too?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.394
Oh, no, our friend
lives here.

42:43.477 --> 42:45.437
- We're staying with her.
-Very nice.

42:45.521 --> 42:48.983
We usually do hotels, but this
is such a nice neighborhood.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.693
Yeah, the older
couple who owns this bungalow

42:50.776 --> 42:52.903
decided to go on
a last-minute trip, I guess,

42:52.987 --> 42:54.822
and we grabbed the place
off of Airbnb.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.740
So, really lucky for us
they skipped town.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.660
Yeah, really lucky.
Really lucky.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.132
Ray, move your head.

43:57.092 --> 44:02.139
Ooh! Good boy, Norman!
