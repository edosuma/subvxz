Holly,
you have to make a decision.

Who do you pick
as your coach?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.144
I thought we were supposed to

02:02.144 --> 02:04.248
and then everyone
ganged up on me instead.

Really sorry, John.

02:05.283 --> 02:07.488
It's alright.

Do it.

It's "great" cheese.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.212
Oh, my goodness.

02:36.212 --> 02:38.316
Bad joke.
That was terrible.

02:38.316 --> 02:40.220
If I have an empty stomach,
it's a sin.

02:42.424 --> 02:45.565
My family owns a electrical
contracting company,

02:45.565 --> 02:49.639
and actually, the cool part is
it's a woman‐based enterprise.

02:50.775 --> 02:52.645
My mom and my aunt

02:52.645 --> 02:54.649
are actually the president
and vice president

02:54.649 --> 02:55.852
of the company.

02:55.852 --> 02:57.287
It's also family‐owned.

02:57.287 --> 03:00.862
So my sister, brother, dad ‐‐

03:00.862 --> 03:02.665
you name the family member,

03:02.665 --> 03:06.272
chances are that they worked
and helped out there.

03:06.272 --> 03:09.679
My parents are business owners
during the week,

03:09.679 --> 03:11.249
but when the weekends hit,

03:11.249 --> 03:13.621
they are rock stars.

03:13.621 --> 03:16.426
Nanci‐Once you give me
that wireless mic, I just go.

03:16.426 --> 03:18.396
You will me
the on the bar singing.

03:18.396 --> 03:19.733
I get in trouble
all the time.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.539
Me and my siblings get up there.
We sing with them.

03:22.539 --> 03:25.545
My favorite moments is when
my kids are on stage with me.

03:25.545 --> 03:27.414
I would gladly hand
over my microphone

03:27.414 --> 03:28.718
and just sit in the audience
and watch them.

03:28.718 --> 03:30.822
I've seen you fight over
the microphone a few times.

03:32.592 --> 03:33.326
Yes.

03:33.326 --> 03:35.363
I was first introduced
to music

03:35.363 --> 03:37.702
by my dad when I was 13.

03:37.702 --> 03:40.474
My dad called me up
to sing backup vocals,

03:40.474 --> 03:41.910
and that's where I got that bug.

03:41.910 --> 03:44.850
Currently, I perform with
my parents weekend to weekend.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.956
I go gig to gig to gig
all over Long Island ‐‐

03:47.956 --> 03:49.693
outdoor venues, bars.

03:49.693 --> 03:52.565
You know, Bella's whole journey
is our journey.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.968
That's how close we are,
I feel.
Aww.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.940
I am so excited
to go and perform

03:56.940 --> 04:00.581
in front of the most legendary
artists in history.

04:00.581 --> 04:02.952
Ariana,
I can learn so much from her,

04:02.952 --> 04:05.357
especially the runs that she does.

04:05.357 --> 04:07.762
But I love Kelly,
and then John ‐‐

04:07.762 --> 04:09.465
ooh, he's so smooth.

04:09.465 --> 04:11.737
He would be a great coach, too.
All of them.

04:11.737 --> 04:13.974
For my blind audition,
I am singing "Damaged"

04:13.974 --> 04:15.377
by Danity Kane.

04:15.377 --> 04:16.780
It is a pop anthem,

04:16.780 --> 04:19.886
but this rendition,
me my dad came up with.

04:19.886 --> 04:21.657
It's more of an acoustic feel.

04:21.657 --> 04:22.759
It's slowed down.

04:22.759 --> 04:23.994
You feel each lyric.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.998
Holy cannoli.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.468
Come on, John!

04:27.468 --> 04:29.973
Let's go, Kelly Clarkson!

04:29.973 --> 04:31.977
It's on, Blake.
It's on. Bring it on.

04:31.977 --> 04:34.315
This is the first time
I'm singing without my dad

04:34.315 --> 04:36.987
next to me,
but I am here to prove to myself

04:36.987 --> 04:40.427

and I'm here to give it my all.

Bella, that was such
an interesting song choice.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.894
What a fun arrangement.
Oh, my God.

06:53.894 --> 06:55.631
I was like,
"I recognize this melody,"

06:55.631 --> 06:57.635
but you created this whole new
version of the song.

06:57.635 --> 07:00.140
You were doing really light,
folky, singer‐songwritery,

07:00.140 --> 07:01.710
and then you were giving us

07:01.710 --> 07:04.148
the notes that
these ladies are known for.

07:04.148 --> 07:05.651
You can do anything.
Yeah.

07:05.651 --> 07:08.056
And I would love
to coach you, Bella.

07:08.056 --> 07:09.458

I'm in love with your hair,
and if those aren't extensions,

07:14.636 --> 07:15.972
I'm super jealous.

07:17.909 --> 07:19.779
I felt like I could have been
at your show

07:19.779 --> 07:21.148
'cause I didn't know
that song,

07:21.148 --> 07:22.652
and the stuff you did
in the beginning

07:22.652 --> 07:25.123
was so intricate,
but fluid and emotional.

07:25.123 --> 07:26.660
It had a lot of heart
to it.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.831
On this show,
I think, strategically speaking,

07:28.831 --> 07:31.670
it's really a good thing
to be able to navigate

07:31.670 --> 07:33.473
in all those little colors
of your voice

07:33.473 --> 07:34.743
'cause each week,
you have to show them

07:34.743 --> 07:36.178
something different,
and it'd be fun as hell

07:36.178 --> 07:38.182
to pick songs with you.
Thank you.

07:38.182 --> 07:40.186
Thank you very much.

07:42.190 --> 07:45.631
You are so good.
You're such a great singer.
What?!

07:45.631 --> 07:47.167
It's great to have
the ability

07:47.167 --> 07:49.171
to do a lot of different things
with your voice,

07:49.171 --> 07:51.777
and your tone started off
a little bit more folky almost,

07:51.777 --> 07:55.050
and then all of a sudden, your
tone switched into this goddess.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.485
Your control is great.

07:56.485 --> 07:57.955
Your biggest moments
or your loudest moments

07:57.955 --> 08:00.594
were, like, super mixing
and healthy and ‐‐ and yummy,

08:00.594 --> 08:01.897
and I look for that.

08:01.897 --> 08:03.767
I love the different tools
you have in your kit

08:03.767 --> 08:05.170
so that you can look
for different places

08:05.170 --> 08:06.673
to implement them.

08:06.673 --> 08:08.644
I hope you choose me,

08:08.644 --> 08:11.115
and...your outfit
matches my gift.

08:11.115 --> 08:14.856
Wait.
Oh, and you can actually put
your extra tools in her kit.

08:16.025 --> 08:18.997
Thank you.
Blake, what do you have
to say for yourself?

08:18.997 --> 08:21.570
Why don't you turn around,
Blake?
There's two reasons.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.206
The first ‐‐
it was challenging for me.

08:23.206 --> 08:24.642
I was trying just to

08:24.642 --> 08:26.078
read the words
you were spelling,

08:26.078 --> 08:27.815
and at one point,
I thought you were spelling

08:27.815 --> 08:29.619
the word "damn,"
and then all of a sudden,

08:29.619 --> 08:31.122
I realize it's, like,
"damaged," "heart,"

08:31.122 --> 08:33.727
and then by then,
the song is ending.
Oh!

08:33.727 --> 08:35.163
He's slow, is what he's saying.
He is a grandpa.

08:35.163 --> 08:37.735
The other reason is ‐‐
You should get that looked at.

08:37.735 --> 08:40.941
Listening to your voice,
you're singing in Ariana's lane.

08:40.941 --> 08:43.614
For now, I'm staying out of this
and still trying to figure out

08:43.614 --> 08:46.218
why you spelled "damn"
on national television.

08:49.258 --> 08:51.630
Bella, who do you pick
as your coach?

08:51.630 --> 08:54.001
Holy cannoli.
This is crazy.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.573
Everyone's expecting you
to pick

08:56.573 --> 09:00.046
one of our insanely gifted
pop divas,

09:00.046 --> 09:03.119
two of the most incredible pop
singers we have on the Earth.

09:03.119 --> 09:05.190
Keep going. Keep talking.
Like, yes, they really are.

09:05.190 --> 09:09.699
Let it out. Let it out.
Pick someone that they
might not expect you to pick

09:09.699 --> 09:13.072
and go on to win "The Voice"
with John Legend.

09:13.072 --> 09:14.843
You're Italian, right?
I'm Italian. Of course.

09:14.843 --> 09:16.278
I got oregano in here, too.

09:16.278 --> 09:19.719
Okay, now we're talking.
Now we're talking.

09:19.719 --> 09:22.224
This is a hard,
hard decision.

09:22.224 --> 09:24.094
Shake it up!

09:24.094 --> 09:25.664
Shock the world!

09:25.664 --> 09:27.000
Aah!
Come on!

09:27.000 --> 09:29.739
Block them out!

09:29.739 --> 09:31.710
Okay. I just ‐‐

09:31.710 --> 09:34.816
I have to go with my gut.

09:34.816 --> 09:35.818
Ariana.

09:39.191 --> 09:43.232

so technically impressive.

09:47.307 --> 09:48.944
She is super diverse.

09:48.944 --> 09:50.815
I just want to hear

I know.

10:43.052 --> 10:45.123

kind of just flipping it,

11:19.358 --> 11:21.362
making a little more, like,
rock influence.

11:21.362 --> 11:24.134

My name's David Vogel.

13:18.329 --> 13:21.402
I am 23 years old,

Oh, my God.

13:24.207 --> 13:26.045
That was so beautiful.

13:26.045 --> 13:27.848
I thought it was
a really unique take.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.888
I love that you play
an instrument, too, and...

13:30.888 --> 13:32.290
Absolutely. Yeah.

13:33.192 --> 13:34.829
I play a couple instruments.

13:34.829 --> 13:37.400
I started on drums when I was
around 9 years old.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.306
Then, when I was around 14,
I saved a bunch of money

13:40.306 --> 13:42.578
working one summer
and bought an acoustic guitar,

13:42.578 --> 13:45.383
mainly to impress girls.

13:45.383 --> 13:47.454
I went to school
for audio engineering.

13:47.454 --> 13:50.594
I love all aspects of music ‐‐
recording and production

13:50.594 --> 13:54.635
and knowing how it all works,
to then performing live.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.138
Right now, I'm in a band.

13:56.138 --> 13:58.944
We play indie pop,
alternative rock.

13:58.944 --> 14:00.581
This is an incredible
experience.

14:00.581 --> 14:02.150
Ariana Grande is amazing.

14:02.150 --> 14:04.054
She is involved heavily
with her production

14:04.054 --> 14:06.258
and her vocal arrangements.

14:06.258 --> 14:08.462
That's inspiring for me
also as a producer,

14:08.462 --> 14:10.433
and the fact that
she's a female doing that

14:10.433 --> 14:14.474
in a male‐dominated industry,
as well, is just super cool.

14:14.474 --> 14:17.247
It's a really smart thing
to be able to take songs

14:17.247 --> 14:18.517
and make them your own
like that...
Yeah.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.554
...'cause I know that song,
and literally,

14:20.554 --> 14:22.257
it took me a minute,
and I was like, "Oh!"

14:22.257 --> 14:23.627
Yeah, Kelly,
that's an Ariana song.

14:23.627 --> 14:25.196
That's an Ariana song.
No, I know "breathin."

14:25.196 --> 14:28.102
I just ‐‐ I was 100%

14:28.102 --> 14:29.639
not going to turn around
when she turned around

14:29.639 --> 14:33.312
'cause I was like,
"Well, no chance in hell," so...

14:33.312 --> 14:35.049
I'm just excited for you.

14:35.049 --> 14:36.318
I think it's gonna be
really cool.

I love your style.

I waited till the last second

14:46.138 --> 14:48.275
because now you are mine
and mine only.

14:48.275 --> 14:49.679

15:05.209 --> 15:09.084
David did the scariest thing
imaginable,

15:09.084 --> 15:12.190
which is singing
the artist's song

15:12.190 --> 15:14.361
right in front of them.

15:14.361 --> 15:16.398
I think that having a fresh take
on a song,

15:16.398 --> 15:20.173
especially that I've spent
so much time with, was great.

15:20.173 --> 15:21.543

gonna round out my team,

Oh, my goodness.
I love that song.

19:02.918 --> 19:05.924
You did such a really cool
version of it.

19:05.924 --> 19:07.928
Both Kelly and I turned around
the same time,

19:07.928 --> 19:09.397
right when you hit
that little tight run,

19:09.397 --> 19:11.301
and I was like, "Okay."

19:11.301 --> 19:13.707
Thank you.
And then you started
hitting those high notes.

19:13.707 --> 19:15.711
It was so cool
because your voice

19:15.711 --> 19:17.781
really cuts through
so nicely.

to do the runs you did,

especially, like, where you did
them, placed in your voice.

19:36.418 --> 19:38.957
I feel like I'm really good
at knowing when to, like,

19:38.957 --> 19:40.961
round out notes
to make it sound more full,

19:40.961 --> 19:42.898
and I think that
I'm a good coach for that.

19:42.898 --> 19:45.670

19:50.747 --> 19:51.949
Hi, Janora.
Hey.

19:51.949 --> 19:53.485
If your voice
came on the radio,

19:53.485 --> 19:55.724
it would instantly
stand out...
Yeah. Oh.

19:55.724 --> 19:57.493
...and we would all know
that it's you, you know?

19:57.493 --> 20:00.433
Thank you.
I'm not in the mix,
but I am dying to know,

20:00.433 --> 20:01.803
who do you choose
as your coach?

20:01.803 --> 20:06.378
Come on.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.453
Come on, Janora.

20:10.453 --> 20:12.490
Come on.

20:14.494 --> 20:15.731
I pick John.

20:15.731 --> 20:19.638
Yay!

20:21.843 --> 20:23.513
I'm so happy to meet you,
Janora.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.617
Thank you so much!
Welcome.

20:25.617 --> 20:28.422
I love how Janora's voice
really sounds like it could be

20:28.422 --> 20:29.257
on the radio right away.

20:29.257 --> 20:31.529
I made little boxing robes
for my team.

20:31.529 --> 20:33.465
We're ready to win
the championship.
Yeah.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.336
I love Janora, I thought
she had a really good voice,

20:35.336 --> 20:37.808
but there's so many hurdles
when you're up against John.

20:37.808 --> 20:40.881
Yeah!
I thought I'd take a tactic
that maybe coaching her

20:40.881 --> 20:43.686
right now would work.
It backfired.

20:43.686 --> 20:45.356
Alright!

20:45.356 --> 20:47.260
The crowd was chanting,
"John, John,"

20:47.260 --> 20:50.700
and he was just drawing me in,
and I was just like, "John."

20:53.038 --> 20:54.742
John.
Mm‐hmm.

20:54.742 --> 20:56.546
I know your trick.
What do I do?

20:56.546 --> 20:58.315

20:58.315 --> 21:01.354
Last word.

you just gave.

♪ This is "The Voice"
Welcome back to
the blind auditions

21:12.845 --> 21:14.380

21:14.380 --> 21:16.686
I love having female energy
back in the mix.

21:16.686 --> 21:18.021
I know. It's so nice.
Yeah.

21:18.021 --> 21:20.594
The crowd is going bananas
for you

21:20.594 --> 21:21.696
every time.

21:21.696 --> 21:22.531

you talk to the audience.

21:24.702 --> 21:26.639
Nice to see you guys.
Are you having fun so far?

21:26.639 --> 21:27.941
Yeah!
Yes.
Good.

21:27.941 --> 21:28.977
‐Yeah.
‐You're worth it.

21:28.977 --> 21:30.647
Nice. Oh, thank you.

21:30.647 --> 21:33.051
I call it sucking up
to the audience.
Oh, excuse me.

21:33.051 --> 21:35.422
I think you interact
more than anybody.

21:36.391 --> 21:38.462
You have "Ariana"
on your hand?

21:38.462 --> 21:40.099
Why would you do that?

21:40.099 --> 21:41.903
No, I'm kidding.

21:41.903 --> 21:44.708
They're just sitting there,
and it's irresistible

21:44.708 --> 21:46.846
to just talk to them.
And...yeah.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.452
Thank you.

21:51.388 --> 21:53.058
I grew up watching this show

21:53.058 --> 21:54.728
with my family and my friends.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.435
To be here, it's just, like,
so crazy,

21:58.435 --> 22:00.072
like, such an out‐of‐body
experience.

22:00.072 --> 22:02.511
Like, oh, my God.

22:02.511 --> 22:04.615
My name's Kaitlyn Velez.
I'm 21 years old,

22:04.615 --> 22:06.652
and I'm from Long Island,
New York.

22:06.652 --> 22:08.857
I started writing songs at 14.

22:08.857 --> 22:11.762
I just thought it was so cool
that my favorite artists

22:11.762 --> 22:14.033
were able to take me
somewhere else

22:14.033 --> 22:15.904
in, like,
less than three minutes.

22:15.904 --> 22:19.745
I'm Hispanic, and I grew up in
a very predominantly white area,

22:19.745 --> 22:23.485
so I kind of felt like
I stuck out like a sore thumb.

22:23.485 --> 22:25.957
And I was super insecure
because, you know,

22:25.957 --> 22:27.561
my differences were pointed out.

22:27.561 --> 22:31.569
But music and songwriting
was really, like, my place

22:31.569 --> 22:34.508
where I felt so secure
and I felt so safe

22:34.508 --> 22:38.115
and I really had started
to find my identity.

22:38.115 --> 22:40.554
Now I take so much pride

22:40.554 --> 22:44.460
in being a Latina girl
in the United States.

22:44.460 --> 22:47.634
In the last year, I have put out
about seven songs.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.137
One of my songs
that I put out ‐‐

22:49.137 --> 22:51.742
it's called "FOMO,"
the fear of missing out.

22:51.742 --> 22:54.682
In a month,
it had hit 100,000 streams.

22:54.682 --> 22:57.788
The pandemic altered
everyone's life,

22:57.788 --> 22:59.792
so "FOMO" really resonated
with a lot of people

22:59.792 --> 23:03.131
because it was just such
a big theme in the past year,

23:03.131 --> 23:04.802
so I'm super grateful for that.

23:06.706 --> 23:09.143
I'm singing "Please Don't Go"
by Mike Posner

23:09.143 --> 23:10.547
for my blind audition.

23:10.547 --> 23:14.722
The song is a very upbeat song.

23:14.722 --> 23:16.792
I really changed it up
by making it

23:16.792 --> 23:20.667
a very, like, moody,
acoustic type of feel.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.771
And I really wanted
to make this

23:22.771 --> 23:26.779
as authentic and as me
as I could.

23:26.779 --> 23:30.687
Hopefully, that authenticity
really shines through.

Hello! What is your name
and where are you from?

25:23.746 --> 25:25.784
Hi.
My name is Kaitlyn Velez.

25:25.784 --> 25:29.090
I am 21 years old, and I'm from
Long Island, New York.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.159
Alright, Kaitlyn.

25:31.962 --> 25:33.800
Well, I turned for you
pretty early.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.572
I‐I really love the way
your vibrato worked.

25:36.572 --> 25:38.108
It was like really interesting
and distinct.

25:38.108 --> 25:40.914
And I feel like you kind of need
to open up a little bit more,

25:40.914 --> 25:43.218
but, you know,
that's what coaching is for.

25:43.218 --> 25:44.621
I would love
to coach you.

25:44.621 --> 25:46.157
Cool!

25:47.761 --> 25:49.631
Hi, Kaitlyn.
Hi!

25:49.631 --> 25:51.067
Literally, you started singing,
and I was going,

25:51.067 --> 25:53.338
"Ooh, I like her tone,"
but I just was a little hesitant

25:53.338 --> 25:55.643
because I was like, "Hmm,
I wonder if she can open up."
Mm‐hmm.

25:55.643 --> 25:58.616
So I guess you're
going to show me on the show.

25:58.616 --> 25:59.651
Congratulations.

25:59.651 --> 26:01.287
Thank you.

26:02.958 --> 26:05.229
Kaitlyn, I think you've got
a really unique

26:05.229 --> 26:07.868
and personality‐filled
voice.

26:07.868 --> 26:08.970
Do you write?

26:08.970 --> 26:12.711
I have been playing my ukulele
since I was probably 14,

26:12.711 --> 26:14.982
and that's what I started
writing songs with.

26:14.982 --> 26:16.585
That's amazing.
That's so cool.

26:16.585 --> 26:17.788
See, I would love
to listen to that.

26:17.788 --> 26:19.190
I just was thinking
about this context

26:19.190 --> 26:21.127
and that's why I didn't hit,
but I love your voice.

26:21.127 --> 26:23.699
You're super talented.
Thank you. Thank you.

26:25.770 --> 26:27.206
Instantly,
when I turned around,

26:27.206 --> 26:28.843
I was watching this like,
"Oh, she's a songwriter,"

26:28.843 --> 26:31.214
and I only learned that
from Meghan Trainor,

26:31.214 --> 26:35.022
who's ‐‐ has written
all those cool, funky songs

26:35.022 --> 26:36.124
that she has on ukulele.

26:36.124 --> 26:38.863
And I understand what they're
saying about opening up,

26:38.863 --> 26:41.769
but I also think
it's important to recognize

26:41.769 --> 26:44.140
what somebody feels
comfortable doing

26:44.140 --> 26:46.712
in order to express
whatever their art is,

26:46.712 --> 26:48.783
and you may have a different way
of expressing that

26:48.783 --> 26:50.620
than a singer
that can come out here

26:50.620 --> 26:52.156
and just blow the roof
off the place.

26:52.156 --> 26:53.893
There's nobody like you
on my team,

26:53.893 --> 26:56.799
and I'd be proud to protect
that spot for you,

26:56.799 --> 26:59.137
and I'd love to be
your coach.

26:59.137 --> 27:02.209
Thank you. Thank you.

27:02.209 --> 27:04.280
I feel like you have
an interesting perspective,

27:04.280 --> 27:05.650
and nobody sounds like you

27:05.650 --> 27:07.286
probably on the show
this season.

My mom says,
when I was in her stomach,

30:23.278 --> 30:25.482
she used to sing Mariah Carey
and Whitney Houston to me,

30:25.482 --> 30:28.321
and she says that's how I got
my singing ability.

30:28.321 --> 30:32.329

but that's what she says.

Quarryville, Pennsylvania,

30:36.104 --> 30:38.542

30:38.542 --> 30:41.347
My mom was a single mother
with four kids.

30:41.347 --> 30:43.619
We didn't have much growing up,

30:43.619 --> 30:46.157
so I went to a boarding school
for low‐income families.

30:46.157 --> 30:49.463
Actually, my sister was the one
who was supposed to be going,

30:49.463 --> 30:52.604

activities on the screen,

30:52.604 --> 30:55.375
I was like, "I want to go."

30:55.375 --> 30:57.479
It was honestly a huge blessing.

30:57.479 --> 31:00.352
I took advantage of all
the music activities they had.

31:00.352 --> 31:04.093

I did the talent shows.

31:04.093 --> 31:05.530

I'm a senior

You have a beautiful voice.
I think it just needs to be

32:56.618 --> 32:58.656
the tiniest bit
more consistent,

32:58.656 --> 33:00.392
and the storytelling
in the beginning

33:00.392 --> 33:04.534
has to be as moving
as the climax at the end,

33:04.534 --> 33:08.308

is gonna be the key.

33:08.308 --> 33:09.644

a beautiful voice.

33:09.644 --> 33:12.650
It just felt like you
weren't on sure footing.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.386
But then when you started
to soar

33:14.386 --> 33:16.123
on those higher notes,
it was like,

33:16.123 --> 33:18.696
"Oh, that's the place where
she feels really comfortable."

33:18.696 --> 33:20.766
Those high notes
were, like, thrilling.
So impressive, so good.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.670
They were, like, thrilling
high notes.

33:22.670 --> 33:25.008
Thank you.
You picked a hell
of a song,

33:25.008 --> 33:26.545

that means you're powerful.

You're confident.
You believe in yourself.

33:28.516 --> 33:31.722
I want to hear what you sound
like abandoning all of the

33:31.722 --> 33:33.626
"I must hit this note,
I must be perfect,"

33:33.626 --> 33:37.567
because then I think you kind of
lose the believability factor,

33:37.567 --> 33:39.504
but I'm begging you
to come back.

33:39.504 --> 33:41.274
I definitely will.

she was in her head
a little too much.

33:49.123 --> 33:54.534
I'm listening for energy,
passion, and chills.

34:44.834 --> 34:46.270
What in the world?

34:46.270 --> 34:48.542
We see ourselves
as pop gospel artists

34:48.542 --> 34:49.811

34:49.811 --> 34:52.482
has been singing together

Music has just always been
a part of our lives.

34:54.621 --> 34:58.629
We actually are biracial.
My mom is a white redhead,

34:58.629 --> 35:01.400
and my dad
is an albino black man.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.171
And so my father
doesn't look black,

35:03.171 --> 35:04.373
but he is.

35:04.373 --> 35:05.776
The way
I explained it to them ‐‐

35:05.776 --> 35:07.547
I said, "Okay, honey,
you got this glass of milk.

If you put some
Hershey's syrup in it,

35:08.816 --> 35:10.786
that's like your pigment,
so you see this,

35:10.786 --> 35:12.489
this only has a little bit
of Hershey's syrup,

35:12.489 --> 35:13.792

than this other one."

35:20.338 --> 35:21.842
but we also didn't
look black.

35:21.842 --> 35:23.646
And so
throughout middle school,

35:23.646 --> 35:25.315
we went through
a lot of bullying.

They'd be like, "Why are you
trying to act Black?"

35:33.666 --> 35:35.402
And so I tried
to explain to them

35:35.402 --> 35:37.674
what my father is,
but they'd say rude things.

35:37.674 --> 35:39.678
It's kind of a trend
to be mean nowadays,

35:39.678 --> 35:41.815

39:21.688 --> 39:22.757
and welcome to "The Voice."

39:22.757 --> 39:25.596
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

39:25.596 --> 39:28.835
Hello, Cunningham Sisters
from Hamilton, Ohio.
Hi.

39:28.835 --> 39:31.106
We get it. They're from Ohio.
You're from Ohio.

39:31.106 --> 39:32.777
Oh, my goodness.

39:32.777 --> 39:34.881
I've been to Ohio.
My mom was from Ohio.

39:34.881 --> 39:36.918
Really?
See how much
we have in common?

39:36.918 --> 39:39.524
Been there.
That was a gospel song, right?

39:39.524 --> 39:41.493
Yes.
We love country music, too.

39:41.493 --> 39:42.763
Come on, come on.

39:42.763 --> 39:44.066
And pop.
We love all the genres,

39:44.066 --> 39:45.501
but our main one
is gospel.

39:45.501 --> 39:46.504
You all sing in church
at home?

39:46.504 --> 39:47.840
Yes.
Yes. Yes.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.811
We've been singing in church
for a really long time.

39:49.811 --> 39:51.548
Amazing.
Me, too.
That's where I started.

39:51.548 --> 39:54.721
That's crazy.
That's absolutely
where I started.

39:54.721 --> 39:56.558
I grew up singing
in the church.

39:56.558 --> 39:57.927
Who's here with you?

39:57.927 --> 39:59.129
Our dad.

39:59.129 --> 40:00.633
Hi, Dad.

40:00.633 --> 40:02.637
By the way...
He's beaming.

40:02.637 --> 40:05.976
...your dad was dancing
like the entire time.

40:05.976 --> 40:07.613
He was your biggest fan ‐‐
the entire time.

40:07.613 --> 40:10.619
He was so excited for you.
Does he sing, too?

40:10.619 --> 40:11.922
Yes.
I love that.

40:11.922 --> 40:13.892
My family's
just like that, and...

40:13.892 --> 40:15.596
Ugh.

40:15.596 --> 40:17.098
And I don't have a group
on my team.

40:17.098 --> 40:19.570
All the other coaches
have either a duo or a trio.

40:19.570 --> 40:22.008
My group does not sound
anything like you.

40:22.008 --> 40:24.814
They all have a duo or a trio
on their team.

40:24.814 --> 40:28.989
Like nothing.
And the lane is wide open
on Team Legend.

40:28.989 --> 40:31.226
We would have so much fun.
I would love to be your coach.

40:31.226 --> 40:33.799
Thank you.

40:33.799 --> 40:37.172
Okay, you have so much in
common, right, with John, right,

40:37.172 --> 40:41.046
but you're here
to learn new stuff.
Okay.

40:41.046 --> 40:43.852
And I know how to...

40:43.852 --> 40:45.990
navigate a competition.
Ah.

40:45.990 --> 40:47.793
And I'm gonna do something
right now,

40:47.793 --> 40:49.564
which I'm probably
already gonna lose anyway,

40:49.564 --> 40:51.735
so I'm just going to go all in.
I'm gonna start coaching you.

40:51.735 --> 40:53.572
Y'all both have
amazing voices.

40:53.572 --> 40:54.974
On your own,
you could have careers.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.945
I didn't know there were
two people until I turned around

40:56.945 --> 40:59.917
because I turned around
so early, you know?
Mm‐hmm.

40:59.917 --> 41:03.592
But one thing I did notice
is it wasn't perfectly in sync.

41:03.592 --> 41:04.827
You have to learn
how to blend

41:04.827 --> 41:07.165
and to let the other
shine in moments.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.671
And I am really good at that.

41:09.671 --> 41:12.843
Honestly, I love working
on harmonies with a group

41:12.843 --> 41:15.616
and helping you figure out
the best way to arrange a song

41:15.616 --> 41:17.687
to take advantage of
the best parts of your voices.

41:17.687 --> 41:20.491
I would love for you
to be on Team Legend.

41:22.763 --> 41:26.671
Macie and Marie,
who do you pick as your coach?

41:26.671 --> 41:28.274
Uh...

41:31.581 --> 41:32.850
Come on.

41:35.288 --> 41:36.758
Whew, ooh!

41:39.162 --> 41:42.235
We pick...

41:42.235 --> 41:44.206
Kelly!
Whoa!

41:44.206 --> 41:45.709
She's shocked.

41:45.709 --> 41:47.880
What?!
Yes!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.617
Kelly!

41:49.617 --> 41:54.927
Oh, my ‐‐ Oh, my God!
What?!

41:54.927 --> 41:56.698
I was shocked

41:56.698 --> 41:58.300
that The Cunningham Sisters
picked me.

41:58.300 --> 41:59.302
I'm so excited.

41:59.302 --> 42:01.206
What just happened?!

42:01.206 --> 42:02.877
Oh, my gosh!

42:02.877 --> 42:04.914
Usually in groups, one kind of
outshines the other...

42:04.914 --> 42:06.951
Yeah!
...not the case here,
and I'm just really excited

42:06.951 --> 42:09.056
about going through songs
with them.

42:09.056 --> 42:11.193
Oh, my God, Dad!

42:11.193 --> 42:13.197
Whoo!

42:13.197 --> 42:15.869
Dad, what happened?

42:15.869 --> 42:17.606
I thought I had an in
with them.

42:17.606 --> 42:19.644
Maybe I never had a chance.

42:19.644 --> 42:21.648
This is Blake's camera.

42:21.648 --> 42:23.284
They're going
to the lives!

42:23.284 --> 42:24.821
All the way to the finale,
y'all.

42:24.821 --> 42:26.290
Blake's Win Cam...
Whoo!

42:26.290 --> 42:28.562
...it didn't say
nobody else could use it,

42:28.562 --> 42:29.864
so I walked right on up there.

42:29.864 --> 42:30.966
I used it.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.570
Use it up.
