00:01.039 --> 00:02.838
<i>Previously on Broadchurch...</i>

00:02.839 --> 00:04.518
Trish Winterman received

00:04.519 --> 00:07.679
an anonymous threatening text
message from a blocked number.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.158
Trish, could the text be from
the man that you slept with

00:10.159 --> 00:11.559
on the morning you were attacked?

00:11.560 --> 00:13.919
I told you, I'm not
talking about him.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.958
We are probably
gonna retrieve his DNA

00:15.959 --> 00:17.478
from your bedsheets anyway.

00:17.479 --> 00:19.038
She's a woman
dealing with trauma

00:19.039 --> 00:20.919
and you are pushing
too hard - dial it back.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.279
11 grand for
our little boy's life?

00:23.280 --> 00:24.958
I don't want compensation.
I want justice.

00:24.959 --> 00:28.078
We don't want it! We're telling
you and you don't seem to hear.

00:28.079 --> 00:30.999
To process a civil suit, we'd
need Mr Miller's whereabouts.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.719
- We'd need an address for him.
- There it is, then. We can't.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.758
No-one knows where he is anymore.

00:35.759 --> 00:38.599
That stuff you did to the laptop
I gave you - can you delete it?

00:38.600 --> 00:42.118
Get me the computer,
I'll get it removed.

00:42.119 --> 00:43.878
You have to remember, Trish -

00:43.879 --> 00:47.478
you have to do everything
you can to help them catch him.

00:47.479 --> 00:49.759
We're all in danger if you don't.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.280
Are you sure about this, Trish?

01:06.319 --> 01:08.799
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.518
I'm sure.

01:11.519 --> 01:13.399
I wanna help.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.560
I wanna remember.

01:34.879 --> 01:38.958
So I got dropped off back there.

01:38.959 --> 01:41.118
Walked in this way.

01:41.119 --> 01:43.559
- Can I...
- Whatever you want.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.079
We'll be led by you.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.518
Did she tell you about the flowers?

02:01.519 --> 02:02.799
No. What flowers?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.318
Someone left her a bunch of flowers

02:04.319 --> 02:06.399
with a card saying
"Thinking of you," unsigned.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.958
Who does she think they're from?

02:07.959 --> 02:09.359
She doesn't know.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.919
- When was this?
- Last night.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.318
- She still got the card?
- Yeah.

02:12.319 --> 02:14.199
Showed it to me when I picked her up.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.000
OK. Thanks, Beth.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.158
So the... the party was in
the main room down here.

02:23.159 --> 02:26.518
But the kitchens, they're
through there, aren't they?

02:26.519 --> 02:28.679
Did you go into the kitchen at all?

02:28.680 --> 02:32.319
Yeah, I did, for a moment.
I'd forgotten.

02:42.239 --> 02:44.919
Yeah, later in the evening,
I brought some plates back.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.399
I was trying to be helpful.
There weren't many staff on.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.118
I just had a quick word with
the guys who were working here.

02:50.119 --> 02:53.399
Oi! Do you mind?
We're trying to work here.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.238
I should have mentioned it
before. I'm sorry.

02:56.239 --> 02:58.158
Not at all - that's why
this is worth doing.

02:58.159 --> 03:01.319
Anything that jogs your memory
or helps you remember.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.878
- How are you doing?
- Yeah, fine.

03:40.879 --> 03:42.638
Really?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.359
You wanna stop?

03:44.360 --> 03:47.400
- Will you stay close to me?
- Yeah.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.759
I was so happy that night.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.439
Ed was the last bloke I walked past.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.919
We should go outside now.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.839
Go ahead. We'll follow.

05:10.159 --> 05:11.958
The owner's here today, right?

05:11.959 --> 05:13.959
Yeah, he said he'd stay
upstairs, out of the way.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.878
Did you notice a
wheelbarrow in the corridor

05:15.879 --> 05:17.599
when we first looked
around this place?

05:17.600 --> 05:20.280
- No.
- No, me neither.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.758
Right, so I smoked here

05:29.759 --> 05:32.359
and Ian...

05:32.360 --> 05:35.799
- Are you trying to humiliate me?
- You made your choice, arsehole.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.518
What are you thinking of,
bringing that slag here tonight?

05:38.519 --> 05:41.359
Which way did he go
when the argument finished?

05:41.360 --> 05:43.518
I don't know.
I turned my back on him.

05:43.519 --> 05:48.559
And then after a few minutes,
I heard my name being called,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.238
I think.

05:50.239 --> 05:53.518
And I walked towards the voice.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.559
But you didn't recognise who it was?

05:55.560 --> 05:58.438
Well, I sort of assumed it was Ian.

05:58.439 --> 06:01.638
You didn't hear the person
behind you before you were hit?

06:01.639 --> 06:03.878
No. No, only at the last minute.

06:03.879 --> 06:07.319
I could almost feel the air moving.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.599
How far did he carry me?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.280
I don't know how close it is.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.878
You OK?

06:34.879 --> 06:36.758
That's the sound.

06:36.759 --> 06:40.400
Trish, you don't have to
put yourself through this.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.638
Will you hold my hand, Beth?

06:43.639 --> 06:45.720
Of course, yeah.

07:12.119 --> 07:14.518
- Trish?
- No, no. Let me do this.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.039
I need to.

08:21.439 --> 08:23.158
Oh, I can smell it.

08:23.159 --> 08:24.878
Trish, let's get you away from here.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.078
No. No, it's...

08:28.079 --> 08:30.559
It's a smell, it's the...

08:30.560 --> 08:33.159
water and leaves and...

08:34.799 --> 08:37.919
what, something else.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.558
Vodka, something like that.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.599
He'd been drinking,
I could smell it on him.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.359
And a...

08:44.360 --> 08:46.759
And there was a light
shining from over there.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.238
- What sort of a light?
- I don't know. Really bright.

08:52.239 --> 08:54.078
Do you think it came from that cottage?

08:54.079 --> 08:56.559
- It was that direction, yeah.
- How bright was it?

08:56.560 --> 08:58.958
I don't know, 'cause
he put his arm over me.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.438
Any clearer about
the type of light, Trish,

09:01.439 --> 09:02.838
or when it came on?

09:02.839 --> 09:04.518
Can I go? I wanna go now.

09:04.519 --> 09:06.959
- Of course you can.
- I'll take you back, Trish.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.878
Oh, I could barely handle that.

09:19.879 --> 09:21.400
Yeah.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.280
What was that light, Miller?

09:30.360 --> 09:32.759
Yeah, there's a security light.
Could have been that.

09:35.159 --> 09:37.238
Often on a motion sensor.

09:37.239 --> 09:39.359
What would have tripped it?

09:39.360 --> 09:41.199
Unless it was
turned on from the inside,

09:41.200 --> 09:42.599
which means someone was in.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.478
Can we not
get access to this place?

09:44.479 --> 09:46.999
We've not heard back yet
from the man who lives here.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.560
Katie's chasing it up.

09:49.759 --> 09:52.319
Suppose it could've been
headlights from a vehicle.

09:53.479 --> 09:55.559
Yeah, maybe.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.319
Is that the right angle?

10:01.079 --> 10:03.478
Unless it was closer than she thinks.

10:03.479 --> 10:07.958
Torchlight maybe shining
down on her. Or a phone.

10:07.959 --> 10:10.118
Yeah, that's possible.

10:10.119 --> 10:12.560
Where's the owner?

10:15.479 --> 10:17.279
My wife took it upon herself

10:17.280 --> 10:19.279
after your chaps had gone
to have a clear-up -

10:19.280 --> 10:21.400
mostly stuff the grandchildren
leave lying around.

10:21.439 --> 10:23.279
So this has all been
found in your grounds

10:23.280 --> 10:24.838
since our crime scene people left?

10:24.839 --> 10:27.199
Yes. I think it's my wife's way

10:27.200 --> 10:29.399
of retaking ownership
after what happened.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.719
We've both been
rather affected by it.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.158
And you didn't think to
tell us you found this stuff?

10:34.159 --> 10:36.158
Oh, no.

10:36.159 --> 10:39.279
Sorry. Is it relevant?

10:39.280 --> 10:40.679
Well, we're still looking for

10:40.680 --> 10:42.359
the weapon used to knock
the woman unconscious.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.638
- Oh, I see.
- Get me an exhibit bag.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.638
This bat needs to go
to the lab for testing.

10:47.639 --> 10:50.359
It's one of a pair, actually.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.799
I've got no idea where
the other's got to.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.719
Katie, how you doing?

10:55.720 --> 10:58.399
I've been working through
the sex offenders register.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.158
There's a convicted rapist
moved back into the area

11:01.159 --> 11:03.118
10 weeks ago - been
released from prison.

11:03.119 --> 11:05.479
Any more details on that?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.919
Yeah, I've just been reading his file.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.838
Ellie, his victim
was tied and gagged.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.000
Just like Trish.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.159
OK, send me his address.
We'll go there now.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.279
So the cricket bat
is in for testing

11:35.280 --> 11:36.958
but there's still
an identical one missing.

11:36.959 --> 11:39.879
We still haven't got whatever
the attacker used to gag Trish.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.399
And we now need to work out

11:41.400 --> 11:43.638
what the light was
Trish saw during the attack.

11:43.639 --> 11:45.318
What else did Harford have?

11:45.319 --> 11:47.118
Trish's phone provider
got back to her.

11:47.119 --> 11:50.478
That anonymous text message
was sent via a website

11:50.479 --> 11:54.038
which requires anyone sending
a message to log in first

11:54.039 --> 11:56.238
and they log all the IP addresses

11:56.239 --> 11:57.999
of any person posting a message,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.999
so they should get back the
details to Katie first thing.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.878
OK. Good.

12:02.879 --> 12:06.200
Aaron Mayford, 31, IT consultant.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.318
Three years for the rape of
a woman at a budget hotel.

12:10.319 --> 12:13.919
Victim was tied to the bed and gagged.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.518
He pleaded not guilty at the trial.

12:15.519 --> 12:17.279
He forced the victim to give evidence.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.158
How long was he inside?

12:19.159 --> 12:22.399
Uh... 16 months. Released on parole.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.318
Well, he sounds like a delight.

12:25.319 --> 12:27.159
Can't wait to meet him.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.199
Hi. DS Miller,
DI Hardy, Wessex Police.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.720
Looking for Aaron?

12:51.239 --> 12:52.759
Can't leave him alone, can you?

12:55.560 --> 12:57.758
Yeah, I read the report.

12:57.759 --> 12:59.158
Wondered if you'd pitch up here.

12:59.159 --> 13:00.518
You're on the register.

13:00.519 --> 13:02.279
We'd be remiss not to rule you out.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.158
Woman in her 50s, wasn't it?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.078
Did you look at the details of my case?

13:06.079 --> 13:08.238
Fussy about age, are you?

13:08.239 --> 13:10.039
You don't need to hear this.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.878
I've served my sentence.
I'm entitled to a fresh start.

13:17.879 --> 13:19.279
No, you're out on parole,

13:19.280 --> 13:20.919
which means you're
still doing your time.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.599
And what about the woman
you raped, Aaron?

13:22.600 --> 13:23.999
Did she get a fresh start?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.038
If you're interested in the truth,

13:26.039 --> 13:27.758
the girl was as pissed as I was.

13:27.759 --> 13:29.838
Girl? How old was she?

13:29.839 --> 13:32.159
- 27.
- Woman, then.

13:33.039 --> 13:36.238
The woman and I met at a conference.

13:36.239 --> 13:38.279
We had a drink.
She came back to my room.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.078
We had sex. It was a laugh.

13:40.079 --> 13:41.799
When she woke up, she freaked.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.438
She told me she had a husband.

13:43.439 --> 13:45.318
That's when she started
accusing me of things.

13:45.319 --> 13:47.958
- Like tying her up.
- I did tie her up, yeah.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.919
I like to play. So what?

13:50.920 --> 13:52.919
There's nothing abnormal about it.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.319
Everyone's reading
'50 Shades of Grey' on the bus.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.919
- I'm not a rapist.
- According to a jury, you are.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.680
Well, juries get
things wrong, don't they?

14:06.159 --> 14:08.599
What is it you do now, Aaron?

14:08.600 --> 14:11.238
Data entry.

14:11.239 --> 14:13.758
Company send me boxes of files,
I input the data.

14:13.759 --> 14:15.478
They set me up with it for my release.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.838
- You work from home?
- Yeah.

14:17.839 --> 14:20.399
Not many offices would want me
in there now, would they?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.720
No.

14:22.879 --> 14:24.799
Where were you last Saturday night?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.560
Fishing.

14:27.839 --> 14:29.919
I do that every Saturday now.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.038
Go down to the beach,
set up. All night.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.878
Me and my dad used to do it

14:33.879 --> 14:35.719
when we were on holiday,
when I was a kid.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.638
It reminds me of him.
You get the world to yourself.

14:38.639 --> 14:41.518
- Which beach?
- Couple miles east of town.

14:41.519 --> 14:43.359
Around Flintcombe?

14:43.360 --> 14:46.838
No, not that far. About halfway
between there and Broadchurch.

14:46.839 --> 14:48.238
- How'd you get there?
- Drove.

14:48.239 --> 14:50.078
Where'd you park?

14:50.079 --> 14:52.078
There's a National Trust
car park just off the beach.

14:52.079 --> 14:55.679
- What time did you leave home?
- About 10, 11.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.478
- What time did you get back?
- Half six, seven in the morning.

14:58.479 --> 15:00.479
Was your wife up when you got back?

15:00.519 --> 15:02.158
Yeah, she'll remember
me getting in, yeah.

15:02.159 --> 15:04.439
Anyone see you on the beach?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.359
There were a couple of blokes
fishing down the beach.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.438
I passed them on my way to set up.

15:10.439 --> 15:12.360
Can I see your fishing equipment?

15:15.400 --> 15:17.199
Welcome to the man cave.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.400
I try and work out, you know.
An hour or two a day.

15:20.439 --> 15:23.958
Keeps my head clear.
Do you work out?

15:23.959 --> 15:25.600
No.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.518
Fishing gear.

15:34.519 --> 15:36.039
As used on Saturday night.

15:37.119 --> 15:38.919
What bait do you use?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.478
It's mackerel, so hooks and plastic.

15:41.479 --> 15:42.999
Catch anything?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.039
Did alright, yeah.

15:46.639 --> 15:49.078
Quite the gallery you've got.

15:49.079 --> 15:53.039
Mmm. Keeps me motivated.

16:00.159 --> 16:02.238
Well, he certainly
lived down to expectations.

16:02.239 --> 16:04.158
Have Harford check CCTV on all routes

16:04.159 --> 16:06.078
between here and the
beach Saturday night.

16:06.079 --> 16:08.319
I want to know everything
about that man.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.599
Hi, Dad.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.679
Hi, love. How's it going?

16:25.680 --> 16:28.118
Oh, you know. Same.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.838
And how's Mum doing?

16:29.839 --> 16:32.038
Not good. She's in bed.

16:32.039 --> 16:34.719
She went back to Axehampton
today with the police,

16:34.720 --> 16:36.758
see if she could remember anything.

16:36.759 --> 16:39.118
Right. Blimey. And did she?

16:39.119 --> 16:41.879
Did she say that it helped?
She remember anything?

16:41.920 --> 16:44.158
Hmm, not sure.

16:44.159 --> 16:45.919
She was a mess when she came back.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.359
Really upset.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.158
Well, yeah, I guess she would be.

16:50.159 --> 16:52.919
And how about you, love?
How are you holding up?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.958
I'm OK.

16:54.959 --> 16:57.038
I miss you, Dad.

16:57.039 --> 16:59.159
I miss you too, Leah.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.158
Listen, I was wondering -

17:02.159 --> 17:04.919
um, if I popped over,
maybe in the next half-hour,

17:04.920 --> 17:06.318
would that be alright?

17:06.319 --> 17:08.358
I just need to borrow the old laptop.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.279
What for?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.478
Well, it's got some files
on it I need for school.

17:12.479 --> 17:16.078
I'll get it back to you
later tonight. So is that OK?

17:16.079 --> 17:18.719
I don't know.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.719
Well, Mum won't mind.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.078
I don't want to ask her.
I'd have to wake her.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.958
Yeah, no, no, no.
You don't need to bother her.

17:25.959 --> 17:28.159
Listen, it'll be two hours maximum.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.799
It's Mum's computer. You should ask her.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.438
Maybe tomorrow?

17:33.439 --> 17:35.559
Yeah. Yeah, right.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.359
If that's... I'm sure
you're right. Course you are.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.639
Good. That's a plan, then.

17:41.680 --> 17:45.478
And listen, honestly,
don't bother Mum with this.

17:45.479 --> 17:49.318
I'll... I'll catch up
with her direct, OK?

17:49.319 --> 17:52.238
And I'll see you later
in the week, yeah?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.878
- Yeah.
- Love you lots, darling.

17:54.879 --> 17:57.439
Love you too.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.118
Shit.

18:03.119 --> 18:06.239
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

18:13.360 --> 18:14.958
Hopefully Cath can back up

18:14.959 --> 18:16.479
Trish's memories of the party.

18:18.439 --> 18:20.199
Did you get a good night's sleep?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.559
No. You?

18:22.560 --> 18:26.478
I dreamt I was at Axehampton
lying next to the waterfall.

18:26.479 --> 18:28.519
Right.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.439
You should probably go home
an hour early tonight.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.838
Wow. Was that you doing
'supportive boss'?

18:34.839 --> 18:36.758
Yeah.

18:36.759 --> 18:38.400
- No good?
- Awful.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.878
Whole town's
started getting jittery.

18:41.879 --> 18:43.559
But we're not gonna let
this bastard dictate

18:43.560 --> 18:45.238
the way we live our lives.

18:45.239 --> 18:48.039
So me and Ed from work thought,

18:48.079 --> 18:49.599
you know, a football
match on the beach,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.878
put a smile back on everyone's faces.

18:51.879 --> 18:55.279
I've rung round everyone I know,
told them to pass on the word

18:55.280 --> 18:57.919
and we'll just pick teams
from whoever pitches up,

18:57.920 --> 18:59.919
do some sort of knockout competition.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.679
You should come, actually.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.199
Bring your partners, kids, whoever.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.158
- Are people coming?
- Yeah.

19:05.159 --> 19:07.599
We can still have
a bit of fun, can't we?

19:07.600 --> 19:10.318
Otherwise he wins, whoever he
is, and we're not having that.

19:10.319 --> 19:12.679
Oh, I've asked Leah
to come too as well.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.199
You know, just in case.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.199
Anyway, sorry, go on -
ask what you need to ask.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.238
Um, what time did you
arrive at Axehampton House

19:19.239 --> 19:21.078
the night of your party?

19:21.079 --> 19:24.359
Um, just after 6:00.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.438
And Jim said he'd been there
most of the afternoon.

19:26.439 --> 19:29.158
What time did people start arriving?

19:29.159 --> 19:31.679
About 7:30 - which was annoying,
actually, because it said 8:00.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.038
I mean, who turns up early
to a thing like that?

19:34.039 --> 19:35.919
It's not like it's
at someone's house, is it?

19:35.920 --> 19:38.679
And where were you
when people arrived?

19:38.680 --> 19:43.118
I was in the main bit -
you know, the library bit,

19:43.119 --> 19:44.799
where the band were playing later.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.399
Could you show us on the diagram?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.958
Yeah.

19:47.959 --> 19:52.518
Um, so we were all in here.

19:52.519 --> 19:55.359
People were coming
in and out of that door there.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.318
And the food was being done there.

19:57.319 --> 19:59.078
You knew everyone on the invite list?

19:59.079 --> 20:01.078
Yeah. Yeah, more or less.

20:01.079 --> 20:03.518
There were a few of
Jim's business associates -

20:03.519 --> 20:06.799
you know, suppliers and stuff -
who I'd maybe met just the once.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.158
Did you witness the fight
between Jim and Ed Burnett?

20:10.159 --> 20:12.318
No. No, I didn't.
I was in the kitchen.

20:12.319 --> 20:14.318
Somebody came running
through to get me,

20:14.319 --> 20:17.638
but by the time I got there,
it was over and Ed had gone.

20:17.639 --> 20:20.038
When did you start
working for Ed Burnett?

20:20.039 --> 20:22.838
Uh... four years ago.

20:22.839 --> 20:26.199
They've been
bickering about it ever since.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.878
Jim hates me working there.

20:27.879 --> 20:30.360
I wouldn't have to if his bloody
garage was doing better.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.638
Could you take us
through your movements

20:33.639 --> 20:35.038
during the course of the night?

20:35.039 --> 20:37.118
Yeah. Um...

20:37.119 --> 20:39.799
I didn't really move
much from that room.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.199
I'd had quite a bit to drink.
Champagne mostly.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.758
I think the waiters were instructed

20:44.759 --> 20:46.959
to keep my glass filled up.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.958
I was just at the door, you know,

20:48.959 --> 20:50.599
watching people come
in, taking presents.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.118
Did you see much of
Trish Winterman that evening?

20:53.119 --> 20:54.518
Course, yeah - I spent quite a bit

20:54.519 --> 20:56.518
of time with her at the beginning.

20:56.519 --> 20:58.838
And then she went off with some
of the other girls from work.

20:58.839 --> 21:02.118
Were you aware of her having
any problems with anyone?

21:02.119 --> 21:05.679
There was a bit of a row
between her and Ian, her ex,

21:05.680 --> 21:08.478
but that was to be expected - he
brought his bloody girlfriend.

21:08.479 --> 21:10.318
I told him not to, but he did anyway,

21:10.319 --> 21:11.878
so Trish wasn't wild about that.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.438
Did Trish and Sarah talk?

21:14.439 --> 21:17.238
No. No, no. Trish gave her a wide berth.

21:17.239 --> 21:19.158
I was civil, that was it.

21:19.159 --> 21:22.159
I saw Sarah and Ian having a
barney a bit later on, actually,

21:22.200 --> 21:24.919
and then she left
shortly after that, luckily.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.999
Did she talk to anyone else?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.919
Ed, obviously.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.679
Or rather, Ed talked to her.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.679
Ed'd spend all night
with Trish if he could.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.239
She came over to me
about 9:00 to be rescued.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.279
He's not a naturally
sociable person, Ed.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.279
He sticks to one or two people,
and I think she'd had enough.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.799
Martin Skittles from the pub.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.799
A few others.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.319
Jim, obviously.

21:49.159 --> 21:53.319
Um, could you describe
your marriage to us, Cath?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.158
That's relevant, is it?

21:57.159 --> 21:59.280
Well, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

22:03.039 --> 22:05.958
I'd describe it as loveless.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.479
That do?

22:08.479 --> 22:10.279
Could you expand on that a little?

22:10.280 --> 22:13.639
No, I think
that pretty much sums it up.

22:16.319 --> 22:18.639
Can you tell us anything
else about the party?

22:21.959 --> 22:23.719
Yeah.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.878
I didn't think anything
of it at the time.

22:25.879 --> 22:27.559
I wasn't gonna mention it, but...

22:27.560 --> 22:31.279
I don't know where Jim was
at the end of the evening.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.078
When you say "end of the evening"...

22:33.079 --> 22:35.679
Well, from half eleven on
till about half past one.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.919
Couldn't find him anywhere.

22:37.920 --> 22:42.560
He wasn't in the main bit and
he wasn't in the grounds nearby.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.279
So, where do you think he was?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.958
Well, I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.639
You'd have to ask him.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.600
Beth!

23:19.119 --> 23:22.478
Ed Burnett. Farm shop bloke.

23:22.479 --> 23:26.118
Yeah, I remember you. Were you
waiting for me to come out?

23:26.119 --> 23:30.318
Sort of. Look, I know
you're helping Trish.

23:30.319 --> 23:32.518
- Cath Atwood told me.
- I can't talk to you about that.

23:32.519 --> 23:36.199
I just want to know...
is she doing OK?

23:36.200 --> 23:38.118
Right, just so we're clear -

23:38.119 --> 23:40.118
everything between me
and Trish is confidential.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.399
I'm her boss.
She's worked for me for years.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.279
- I'm worried, that's all.
- I can't discuss her with you.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.359
Then can you pass on a message?

23:48.360 --> 23:50.919
Tell her I'm thinking
about her, we all are,

23:50.920 --> 23:52.799
and anything she needs,
anything at all,

23:52.800 --> 23:54.478
I'm absolutely there for her.

23:54.479 --> 23:57.118
It's not appropriate
for me to do that.

23:57.119 --> 23:59.319
Right. Uh, OK.

24:01.159 --> 24:03.838
- Can't you ask Cath Atwood?
- I have.

24:03.839 --> 24:05.638
You know, belt and braces.

24:05.639 --> 24:07.799
I've gotta go.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.799
Sure. Sorry for holding you up.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.279
You coming to the beach later?

24:11.280 --> 24:13.560
- For the football?
- Yeah.

24:23.239 --> 24:26.199
Mr Latimer? Nick Foulkes.
We spoke on the phone.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.078
Yeah, yeah. You alright?
Do you want a coffee?

24:28.079 --> 24:29.559
No, I really can't stop.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.599
I just thought as I was driving past,

24:31.600 --> 24:34.119
better let you have it in person
than the vagaries of the post.

24:34.159 --> 24:35.799
I can remember when our postal system

24:35.800 --> 24:37.199
was the envy of the world.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.199
Now we get one delivery
a day if we're lucky.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.560
- What did you find out?
- I got everything you asked for.

24:44.319 --> 24:46.318
Everything? That didn't take long.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.359
Not to let light in upon the magic,

24:48.360 --> 24:50.079
but it really wasn't that difficult.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.638
My invoice is in there also.

24:53.639 --> 24:54.839
Right. Thanks.

24:56.439 --> 25:00.438
I've given you a 50% discount
in light of your circumstances.

25:00.439 --> 25:02.318
What do you mean?

25:02.319 --> 25:06.519
I'm truly sorry. For your loss.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.199
- Oy-oy!
- Hey.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.279
Thought it was you! You alright?

25:19.280 --> 25:21.879
- You hear about this match?
- I did.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.600
Yeah!

25:54.519 --> 25:56.200
Come on, then.

26:02.319 --> 26:04.479
- What's that?
- Bloody hell, Ed!

26:06.200 --> 26:07.560
Prick.

26:36.519 --> 26:38.478
Good on you, girl.

26:38.479 --> 26:40.599
Hiya!

26:40.600 --> 26:42.559
- You alright?
- Yeah.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.078
Hello, love. Hello, darling.
You alright?

26:45.079 --> 26:47.239
- You want a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

26:48.119 --> 26:50.518
Well, keep going. It's only Trish.

26:50.519 --> 26:52.000
Bloody hell!

27:05.079 --> 27:07.158
Michael seems alright now.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.078
Put that school thing behind him.

27:09.079 --> 27:12.200
Sorry? What school thing?

27:14.360 --> 27:17.078
Him and another boy were suspended.

27:17.079 --> 27:19.119
Watching pornography.

27:20.519 --> 27:22.759
Sorry. I... I thought you knew.

27:24.159 --> 27:27.318
- Clive didn't tell me.
- Right.

27:27.319 --> 27:28.719
Right.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.800
Listen, I'm so sorry.

27:33.039 --> 27:36.039
I'm worried I'm losing him, Paul.

27:37.079 --> 27:39.758
- Your husband?
- My boy.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.679
We were always so close.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.838
He'd tell me anything.

27:43.839 --> 27:45.478
He was a proper home boy.

27:45.479 --> 27:48.400
Then he hits 14 and it all changes.

27:49.439 --> 27:51.359
Michael needs a dad now.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.600
It's a different sort of love.

27:55.159 --> 27:57.838
I'm scared Clive's not up to it.

27:57.839 --> 27:59.878
How can you be a good parent

27:59.879 --> 28:01.519
when you're still a child yourself?

28:07.639 --> 28:09.600
Dad, pass the ball.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.038
See? Told you
this was a good idea.

28:22.039 --> 28:24.158
I'm really proud of you, mate.

28:24.159 --> 28:26.438
I think I'm ready to go home now.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.600
- You did well being here.
- Thanks.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.318
- Mind if I take this?
- This your company's handiwork?

28:50.319 --> 28:53.600
Yep. I'll get you
a discount if you like.

28:54.959 --> 28:57.519
Come on, Leo.
Get your arse into gear.

29:00.119 --> 29:02.838
- Hi.
- Hi. You two know each other?

29:02.839 --> 29:05.159
Yeah, I used to teach him.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.919
That was a bit awkward,
Trish making an appearance.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.600
Did you talk to her?

29:14.639 --> 29:18.958
No. Didn't feel... the moment.

29:18.959 --> 29:21.600
Bit public. She's still...

29:22.959 --> 29:25.038
Let me get this out of the way.

29:25.039 --> 29:27.519
Come on, Leo. Keep your end up.

29:30.079 --> 29:32.238
Blue twine on the goals.

29:32.239 --> 29:35.439
Yeah. We need to check that boy's alibi.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.318
I've just received

29:43.319 --> 29:45.318
urgent oral authority
from the superintendent

29:45.319 --> 29:47.038
for surveillance on
our friend Aaron Mayford.

29:47.039 --> 29:49.078
You and Steve need to
get down to his house

29:49.079 --> 29:50.878
till the surveillance team's organised.

29:50.879 --> 29:53.038
I'm having Anna get all the
background information on him.

29:53.039 --> 29:55.039
Any particular reason for this?

29:55.079 --> 29:57.599
Uh, I don't like him,
and we rattled his cage earlier,

29:57.600 --> 30:00.078
so I wanna know what
he does and where he goes.

30:00.079 --> 30:02.479
Alright. I'll let you know.

30:07.519 --> 30:09.039
Right, uh...

30:10.560 --> 30:12.958
I'm away, Miller. You should be too.

30:12.959 --> 30:14.878
Should take a moment
off, have a breather.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.518
You alright?

30:16.519 --> 30:19.199
It's not like you, clocking
off after only 12 hours.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.078
Have you got something planned?

30:21.079 --> 30:22.600
No. Not at all.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.958
Oh, OK.

30:25.959 --> 30:29.239
Well, have a nice night doing
whatever it is you're not doing.

30:57.119 --> 30:58.838
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:58.839 --> 31:02.439
I'm Chloe. Latimer. Is your dad in?

31:03.720 --> 31:05.158
No, sorry.

31:05.159 --> 31:07.399
Good, 'cause it's you I wanna see.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.719
- Me?
- Yeah.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.559
I tried to talk to you earlier

31:10.560 --> 31:12.720
at the football, but there
were too many people around.

31:13.759 --> 31:15.920
I heard what happened.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.279
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.719
You do.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.600
I know you're new. It's hard.

31:24.879 --> 31:27.000
I thought maybe you'd need a friend.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.239
I do a bit, yeah.

31:57.119 --> 31:59.999
- Alec?
- Yes, hi. Zoe?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.600
Yep. I... I recognised you.

32:02.639 --> 32:04.838
Oh, you're wearing a suit!

32:04.839 --> 32:06.359
Uh, I wasn't sure - is that wrong?

32:06.360 --> 32:09.039
No, no, no!
Top marks for effort.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.680
Uh, sit down, please.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.119
- Menu there.
- Thank you.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.438
Drink - do you want a drink?

32:21.439 --> 32:24.078
Uh, white wine, dry.

32:24.079 --> 32:26.559
Like my men!

32:26.560 --> 32:28.359
Ooh! Oh, no, that's...

32:28.360 --> 32:31.800
- Uh, I'm quite nervous. Are you?
- Yeah.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.000
Thank you for saying that.
Men don't normally say that.

32:36.039 --> 32:37.719
Don't they?

32:37.720 --> 32:40.438
It's a bit daunting.

32:40.439 --> 32:43.199
My daughter helped me with the profile.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.919
- Oh, you've got kids?
- Yeah.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.958
Well, that wasn't on there.

32:47.959 --> 32:50.719
- Isn't it?
- No.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.599
Oh, shit, sorry. I didn't...

32:52.600 --> 32:55.118
I mean, it was my
daughter who set me up.

32:55.119 --> 32:57.359
So she did all the swiping?

32:57.360 --> 32:59.159
No, I mean. I chose you based on...

33:00.360 --> 33:02.078
Uh...

33:02.079 --> 33:04.638
I mean, did I say that, uh...

33:04.639 --> 33:06.038
you look really nice?

33:06.039 --> 33:07.999
Thank you.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.559
- So do you.
- Do I?

33:09.560 --> 33:11.639
Yeah.

33:15.439 --> 33:17.958
Uh, we should look at
the menu, shouldn't we?

33:17.959 --> 33:19.479
Right, yeah.

33:29.639 --> 33:31.958
Chloe?

33:31.959 --> 33:34.000
Uh, she's at a mate's.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.999
Lizzie's all asleep upstairs.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.638
- Mark.
- Before you start, I know.

33:39.639 --> 33:41.238
I know. I've been an idiot.

33:41.239 --> 33:43.679
But... this is a sorry.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.238
You know, I thought
maybe... I don't know.

33:47.239 --> 33:48.919
I ran it past Chlo and she thought

33:48.920 --> 33:50.478
it was maybe worth a try.

33:50.479 --> 33:52.078
You don't live here.

33:52.079 --> 33:54.279
Just think of me as
a guest chef for the night.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.118
- You're cooking?
- Yeah.

33:56.119 --> 33:58.238
I'm doing the old fish
and olives, my speciality.

33:58.239 --> 34:00.919
Went to the market this
morning, got fresh bass.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.878
Can I smell burning?

34:02.879 --> 34:04.838
Yeah, I may have
over-toasted the breadcrumbs

34:04.839 --> 34:06.438
a little bit, like an idiot,

34:06.439 --> 34:09.199
but it's fine -
I've opened a window.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.600
You shouldn't just let
yourself in, and start cooking.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.719
I know you've had an hard time at work.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.600
And I've had my head up my arse.

34:18.759 --> 34:21.438
But I don't know. I just
thought maybe we could sit down.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.759
No pressure, just mates.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.518
We're still mates, aren't we?

34:27.518 --> 34:29.800
When was the last time
you cooked fish?

34:31.879 --> 34:33.478
It was your 28th.

34:33.478 --> 34:35.199
Oh, yeah!

34:35.199 --> 34:37.360
And you got me that dress.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.360
Yeah, you looked
beautiful in that dress.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.359
And I got the measurements right.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.000
Come talk to me while I cook.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.237
- No agenda?
- No.

34:51.239 --> 34:54.918
We're not talking about
anything else. No Joe Miller.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.998
No, no. I promise.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.839
Just about us.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.359
Did you just drain all that?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.360
You know it's meant to last all night?

35:37.680 --> 35:39.200
Oh, my God.

35:41.119 --> 35:42.719
- Ooh!
- Ohh!

35:42.720 --> 35:44.158
- Shit! You scared me!
- Miller!

35:44.159 --> 35:46.118
Watch where you're going, will you?

35:46.119 --> 35:48.958
- What are you doing out?
- I'm walking home.

35:48.959 --> 35:51.078
- Back from your cheeky date?
- No.

35:51.079 --> 35:53.199
- Oh, look at your face! You are!
- Shut up, Miller!

35:53.200 --> 35:55.478
- Was she nice? Did you kiss her?
- Outta my way.

35:55.479 --> 35:58.038
Wait, have you seen this? It
just came through. DNA results.

35:58.039 --> 35:59.438
The swabs they took
from Trish Winterman -

35:59.439 --> 36:01.438
we've got a match
with one of our men.

36:01.439 --> 36:02.600
Who?

36:31.680 --> 36:35.238
The DNA sample we took from you
has come back as a match

36:35.239 --> 36:37.838
with a sample we took
from Trish Winterman

36:37.839 --> 36:40.279
after she made an allegation of rape.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.799
Well, it's not a match.
You got it wrong.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.118
It's a positive match, Jim.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.199
No, it can't be.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.158
How do you explain it, then?

36:49.159 --> 36:51.199
It's a mistake.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.999
So you didn't
attack Trish Winterman

36:53.000 --> 36:54.759
on the night of Cath's party?

36:56.639 --> 36:58.838
You think that I raped a woman

36:58.839 --> 37:01.199
at my own wife's birthday party?

37:01.200 --> 37:02.758
- Did you?
- No.

37:02.759 --> 37:05.400
I wouldn't. She's...

37:07.039 --> 37:09.319
She's what?

37:11.079 --> 37:14.318
Look, Jim, all we want is the
truth, and we will get to it.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.238
If you didn't attack her,

37:16.239 --> 37:19.479
why would your DNA
be part of her sample?

37:28.879 --> 37:30.400
Uh...

37:36.639 --> 37:39.280
Saturday morning, um...

37:40.639 --> 37:42.519
the day of the party...

37:45.400 --> 37:46.800
Trish and me...

37:48.119 --> 37:50.039
we were in bed together.

37:53.319 --> 37:56.239
On the morning of your wife's birthday.

37:59.879 --> 38:03.238
She was at work. Um, early shift.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.119
Right.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.759
Is that the first time you and
Trish have slept together?

38:13.479 --> 38:15.039
Yeah.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.078
It was just sex.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.600
'Cause me and Cath, um...

38:21.839 --> 38:24.000
we don't, uh...

38:25.400 --> 38:27.319
Look.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.719
What I'm saying is
I didn't attack Trish.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.279
Why would I?

38:33.280 --> 38:35.759
If I wanted to have
sex with her, I could.

38:37.759 --> 38:39.319
And I did.

38:43.839 --> 38:45.800
Look, you cannot tell Cath.

38:47.079 --> 38:49.000
I don't know what she'd do.

39:01.239 --> 39:03.719
She's my best friend.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.038
If she ever finds out, I...

39:06.039 --> 39:08.999
God, it was a mistake.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.078
I've never felt so bad about anything.

39:11.079 --> 39:13.079
But I just...

39:15.439 --> 39:17.239
I just wanted sex.

39:19.079 --> 39:21.238
That's not wrong, to want that.

39:21.239 --> 39:22.999
No.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.318
Who are the flowers from, Trish?

39:25.319 --> 39:27.158
I don't know.

39:27.159 --> 39:29.359
They were left on the front doorstep.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.759
There's a card.

39:32.159 --> 39:35.039
- Do you mind if we take it?
- No.

39:50.759 --> 39:53.039
- Bloody hell!
- What?

39:54.639 --> 39:57.559
Uh, confirmation of the credit
card used on that website

39:57.560 --> 39:59.999
to send the anonymous
SMS message to Trish.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.360
Belonged to her husband, Ian.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.758
What? Her husband is sending her
abusive anonymous messages?

40:06.759 --> 40:09.519
Yeah. Fancy going to have
a chat with him now-ish?

40:09.560 --> 40:11.280
Yes, I do.

40:13.039 --> 40:15.719
Are you registered with any websites

40:15.720 --> 40:19.599
that enable you to send
anonymous text messages?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.200
No.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.638
We know you are, Mr Winterman.

40:24.639 --> 40:28.999
Well, I'm telling you I'm not.
I think I'd know.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.438
So you didn't send
any messages to Trish,

40:31.439 --> 40:35.118
one of which said,
"Shut up. Shut up or else,"

40:35.119 --> 40:36.799
a couple of days
after she was attacked?

40:36.800 --> 40:38.919
What?! Why would I do that?

40:38.920 --> 40:41.638
I don't know, but we'll
need to see your computer.

40:41.639 --> 40:44.038
- And your phone.
- Why?

40:44.039 --> 40:46.958
Because an account registered to you

40:46.959 --> 40:48.399
was used to send the messages.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.878
Well, it's wrong! It wasn't me.

40:52.879 --> 40:54.599
We'll need your computer.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.279
It'd be better if you just told us

40:56.280 --> 40:57.838
what the text was supposed to mean.

40:57.839 --> 40:59.920
I didn't send any bloody texts.

41:04.079 --> 41:05.438
- Well, someone did.
- Yes, that was possibly me.

41:05.439 --> 41:06.758
Sarah, please say you didn't.

41:06.759 --> 41:09.479
- Who are you?
- Sarah Elsey.

41:09.519 --> 41:12.599
I work here with Ian.
I'm his girlfriend.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.920
And you're now admitting to
sending this text to his wife?

41:15.959 --> 41:18.438
- Ex-wife.
- Not yet!

41:18.439 --> 41:20.878
Yes, I did.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.919
I was on your computer,
I used your card.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.719
Well, I didn't know.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.720
When I sent it, I didn't
know she'd been raped.

41:29.839 --> 41:32.999
- Paul!
- Hello, mate.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.638
Been looking everywhere for you.

41:35.639 --> 41:38.758
When you say 'everywhere',
do you mean 'the church'?

41:38.759 --> 41:40.158
Well, yeah.

41:40.159 --> 41:42.038
Yeah, they do sometimes allow me

41:42.039 --> 41:43.559
outside of the exclusion zone.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.719
Vicar with a sense of humour?
You should advertise.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.638
What are you doing tomorrow?

41:47.639 --> 41:50.238
Uh, are you genuinely asking for
a list of my appointments?

41:50.239 --> 41:52.158
No, but do you think you can move them?

41:52.159 --> 41:54.280
No. Why would I do that?

41:55.239 --> 41:56.679
I'm going on a little trip.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.359
I thought you should
maybe come along too.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.439
- A trip where?
- I found Joe Miller.

42:01.639 --> 42:03.720
Absolutely not.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.799
- It's time to put things right.
- We did that.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.199
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did!

42:08.200 --> 42:09.680
Look, enough of this shit, Mark!

42:11.400 --> 42:13.279
Just leave it alone.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.360
I can't do that, I'm afraid.

42:17.319 --> 42:19.239
Then you're on your own.

42:21.839 --> 42:23.560
Fine.

42:24.639 --> 42:27.119
Yes, of course.
I completely understand.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.680
Yes, that certainly
sounds like one of ours.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.079
No.

42:35.439 --> 42:39.038
OK. How about I call you
back this time next week?

42:39.039 --> 42:41.479
We're only running this
till the end of the month.

42:42.839 --> 42:46.400
Thank you, Tony. Bye-bye. 'Bye.

42:59.959 --> 43:02.758
No, a bacon sandwich.

43:02.759 --> 43:04.919
Well, whatever they've got.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.800
Can you come back as soon as possible?

43:12.400 --> 43:14.999
Oh, Jesus.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.679
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

43:17.680 --> 43:19.078
I could ask you the same question.

43:19.079 --> 43:22.438
- Get out of my car.
- No.

43:22.439 --> 43:25.078
Get out.

43:25.079 --> 43:27.039
Your boyfriend leave you
here alone, did he?

43:28.200 --> 43:30.758
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- That can't be right.

43:30.759 --> 43:32.680
You need to leave my car now.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.759
- You police?
- Yes.

43:35.800 --> 43:38.599
And you're about to get
nicked unless you leave now.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.119
Wouldn't mind being
inside a police girl.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.639
Get back in your house.

43:57.639 --> 43:59.238
You're enjoying this.

43:59.239 --> 44:00.958
No.

44:00.959 --> 44:04.119
Get back inside your
house, in your basket.

44:06.039 --> 44:08.000
I like you watching me.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.279
Hi, Bob. Everything alright?

44:25.280 --> 44:27.199
Woman's just walked in off the street.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.078
I put her in room number 3.

44:29.079 --> 44:31.519
- You need to go and talk to her.
- Why? What's wrong?

44:41.400 --> 44:45.478
Hello. I'm DI Hardy.
This is DS Miller.

44:45.479 --> 44:47.999
The desk sergeant said you asked
to speak to a detective.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.200
- That's right.
- Please.

44:56.879 --> 44:59.280
What is it you'd like
to talk to us about?

45:10.479 --> 45:12.560
Do you have information about it?

45:16.400 --> 45:18.758
Two years ago.

45:18.759 --> 45:21.000
In a field, walking home.

45:23.639 --> 45:25.200
I was...

45:28.680 --> 45:30.638
He tied me up.

45:30.639 --> 45:32.479
Put a gag in my mouth.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.199
I was raped.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.360
And I never told anyone.

45:39.305 --> 45:45.424
