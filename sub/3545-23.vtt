00:00.208 --> 00:02.792
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.875 --> 00:05.750
<i>There is a motive to every mystery...</i>

00:05.834 --> 00:09.625
Your body isn't responding
to the medication the way it should.

00:09.709 --> 00:13.500
- I think I'm having a heart attack.
<i>- ...evidence of every crime...</i>

00:14.417 --> 00:16.625
They're charging you with a hate crime?

00:16.709 --> 00:20.333
- I thought you were cheating with him.
- With our gay cable guy?

00:20.417 --> 00:24.125
I didn't know he was gay.
I didn't know Justin was either.

00:24.208 --> 00:27.375
<i>...and an answer to every question.</i>

00:29.000 --> 00:32.625
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must have been going on.

00:32.709 --> 00:36.792
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is take a closer look.</i>

00:36.875 --> 00:40.500
It had a woman in it.
She was all chopped up.

00:40.583 --> 00:44.333
<i>- And eventually, every secret...</i>
- Do you know where Paul Young is?

00:44.417 --> 00:46.667
I know where he'll be on Thursday night.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.000
<i>...will be revealed.</i>

00:50.083 --> 00:54.333
- Mary Alice was being blackmailed?
- Mary Alice, what did you do?

00:56.667 --> 00:59.083
<i>My name is Mary Alice Young.</i>

00:59.166 --> 01:04.458
<i>Before I died, my life was filled</i>
<i>with love, laughter, friendship,</i>

01:04.542 --> 01:08.041
<i>and sadly, secrets.</i>

01:10.041 --> 01:15.083
<i>The secrets had begun 15 years earlier</i>
<i>when my name was Angela Forrest,</i>

01:15.166 --> 01:18.917
<i>and I was living a life</i>
<i>of quiet desperation.</i>

01:20.750 --> 01:24.625
<i>I'd feel it every morning</i>
<i>as I made breakfast for my husband.</i>

01:24.709 --> 01:28.333
Could you could stop by the market?
I'm out of shaving cream.

01:28.417 --> 01:31.041
<i>And during the errands</i>
<i>I ran in the afternoons...</i>

01:31.125 --> 01:34.041
You'll save a bunch
if you come on Fridays.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.792
<i>...even at my work every evening...</i>

01:36.875 --> 01:40.083
What a lovely calendar.
Was this taken around here?

01:40.166 --> 01:43.875
No, that's way out in Fairview.
I have family there.

01:43.959 --> 01:46.500
Isn't it idyllic?

01:46.583 --> 01:48.792
Here, Angela. You can file this.

01:51.375 --> 01:54.917
<i>...to me, each day</i>
<i>was gray and meaningless.</i>

01:56.792 --> 02:00.500
<i>And then one night, suddenly...</i>

02:00.583 --> 02:03.417
- Hey, Angela.
<i>- ...there was color.</i>

02:03.500 --> 02:08.083
Deidre? What are you doing here?

02:08.166 --> 02:10.417
I need some money.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.750
Deidre. Here.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.291
- You're using again, aren't you?
- No.

02:25.375 --> 02:29.917
I've just got to get some food
for my baby. Some other stuff.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.125
If the baby's hungry, come to the market
and I'll buy food.

02:33.208 --> 02:35.375
I can shop for my own baby, OK?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.709
Quiet. I can't think.

02:39.792 --> 02:44.041
See this watch? It's worth a lot.
I'll give it to you for 50 bucks.

02:44.125 --> 02:47.333
- She's not giving you money.
- Do you mind?

02:47.417 --> 02:52.166
Angela, you're the only one at rehab
who treated me like a person.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.583
Please don't stop now.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.375
I'm sorry.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.083
I'll sell you my baby.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.792
- What?
- I know you can't have your own.

03:11.875 --> 03:14.583
- It's been killing you.
- It's time that you left.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.667
I'm thinking about Dana.
You'll give him a good home.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.917
OK? He'll be better off.

03:21.709 --> 03:22.709
Quiet.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.500
Honey.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.208
How much money
do you keep in the house?

03:48.625 --> 03:51.291
She has a ten-month old baby.
Where is it?

03:51.375 --> 03:56.083
I don't know. If we'd seen a kid we
wouldn't have left it in a crack house.

03:56.166 --> 04:00.000
- I will have your badge.
- Just let me do my job.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.667
We'll post an officer
at the junkie's bedside,

04:02.750 --> 04:05.709
we'll let her tell us
where she left her kid.

04:35.166 --> 04:38.375
I really do hope you folks
will be happy here in Fairview.

04:38.458 --> 04:39.959
Thank you.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.709
<i>- And we were.</i>
- Wave bye, Zach.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.500
Wave bye-bye.

04:44.583 --> 04:48.125
<i>We were as happy as any family could be.</i>

04:52.750 --> 04:57.375
<i>Until one night three years later...</i>

04:59.709 --> 05:02.250
<i>when there was a knock at our door.</i>

05:05.625 --> 05:09.792
<i>And I was desperate once again.</i>

05:15.166 --> 05:19.667
<i>It was 5:00 in the morning on Wisteria</i>
<i>Lane when the phone calls started.</i>

05:21.000 --> 05:23.709
<i>Each of them knew something was wrong</i>

05:23.792 --> 05:25.417
<i>from that first ring.</i>

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
Hello?

05:28.583 --> 05:31.917
<i>It's an unwritten rule of suburbia...</i>

05:31.959 --> 05:33.125
Hello?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.542
<i>Don't call the neighbors</i>

05:36.625 --> 05:38.250
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

05:38.333 --> 05:40.834
<i>unless the news is bad.</i>

05:40.917 --> 05:41.917
Hello?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.208
<i>And so they came,</i>

05:44.291 --> 05:45.834
<i>with their uncombed hair</i>

05:45.917 --> 05:48.458
<i>and their unmade faces.</i>

05:48.542 --> 05:50.583
<i>They came because</i>

05:50.667 --> 05:53.000
<i>after all these years...</i>

05:53.083 --> 05:54.083
Bree.

05:54.166 --> 05:58.208
<i>...they were no longer just neighbors.</i>

05:59.875 --> 06:02.250
What are you doing here?

06:02.333 --> 06:04.458
We heard Rex had a heart attack.

06:04.542 --> 06:07.041
How is he?

06:07.125 --> 06:08.917
He's stable.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
But they have to put in a pacemaker,

06:11.083 --> 06:13.083
so they're gonna need to operate.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.667
- How did you guys know?
- Danielle called.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.083
So how are you doing?

06:19.166 --> 06:24.166
We were having a fight when he
got the heart attack and...

06:24.250 --> 06:27.792
I'm feeling guilty 'cause I should have
gotten him here sooner and...

06:27.875 --> 06:29.834
Honey, the doctors here are great.

06:29.917 --> 06:32.166
He's gonna bounce right back.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.333
You have nothing to worry about.

06:34.417 --> 06:38.542
You know what? I am so happy
that you guys came here. I really am.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.959
But I am trying hard to be strong,

06:41.041 --> 06:43.166
so if you keep comforting me...

06:43.250 --> 06:45.000
You're gonna lose it?

06:45.083 --> 06:46.750
Then we won't comfort.

06:46.834 --> 06:47.834
Thank you.

06:47.917 --> 06:51.500
We'll just talk about non-crisis things.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.834
I know. I found Mrs. Huber's journal

06:59.917 --> 07:01.208
in some of Mike's stuff.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.875
She knew Mary Alice's secret

07:02.959 --> 07:04.417
and was blackmailing her.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.250
Yep, that'll do it.

07:12.375 --> 07:15.375
Zachary, come back here, please.

07:23.583 --> 07:27.709
Your father said
you should let me look after you.

07:27.792 --> 07:30.875
I will be fine by myself.
I am not a child.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.458
I know you're not a child,

07:37.542 --> 07:39.417
but I think we should discuss this.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.125
I'm fine. Really.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.291
Why should you fend for yourself

07:43.375 --> 07:45.250
when you can just come home with me?

07:45.333 --> 07:48.125
Let me shoulder the burden.
It would be my pleasure.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.208
What kind of freak are you?
Just leave me alone.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.417
You are not my mother.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.542
I told you that I am fine.
Stop acting like my mother and go home.

07:56.625 --> 07:59.291
I wish it were that easy, Zachary,

07:59.375 --> 08:00.792
for your sake.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.250
But it's not.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.417
Your father's not coming back.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.583
- He said that he was.
- He lied.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.583
I wanted to spare you this,

08:10.667 --> 08:13.500
but your father and I discussed it

08:13.583 --> 08:15.917
and he decided

08:16.000 --> 08:18.333
that he shouldn't come back.

08:21.417 --> 08:25.375
Get your bag and let's go home.

08:27.792 --> 08:30.583
I'm gonna make you some pudding.

08:41.709 --> 08:43.291
What did you do to my dad?

08:44.709 --> 08:46.417
Tell me.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.291
Mrs. Applewhite?

08:50.375 --> 08:51.333
Yes?

08:51.417 --> 08:53.083
Hi. I'm Edie Britt.

08:54.542 --> 08:56.792
The realtor who helped you
buy this house.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.041
Of course. Hi.

08:59.125 --> 09:02.166
Hi. I've been so curious to meet you.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.709
Really? Why?

09:05.750 --> 09:09.333
It's just that I've never sold a house
over the phone before.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.208
You were brave
buying a place site unseen.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.291
Not really.

09:14.375 --> 09:17.834
It was just what we were looking for.

09:17.917 --> 09:20.083
This is my son, Matthew.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.709
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.792
Please, call me Edie.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.875
Ma'am is for middle-aged women.

09:27.959 --> 09:30.083
Like her.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.834
You can call her ma'am
any time you want.

09:34.917 --> 09:37.500
So are you two finding everything OK?

09:37.583 --> 09:40.000
We didn't do
our realtor's walkthrough.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.834
Everything is fine.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.625
Honey. Escrow's closed.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.875
Now I can show you where
to put the buckets when it rains.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.458
Edie, the house is fine.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.583
But how lovely of you to stop by.

09:56.125 --> 10:00.709
OK. Here is my card.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.166
Call any time you want.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.500
Bye.

10:15.625 --> 10:18.208
People are very friendly
in this neighborhood.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.625
Yes. Yes, they are.

10:23.875 --> 10:27.959
Mike, hi, sweetie.
I hope the job's going well.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.917
So I hope you're not mad

10:30.000 --> 10:33.125
but I found Mrs. Huber's journal
in your truck

10:33.208 --> 10:36.583
and I couldn't exactly not read it,
so I did,

10:36.667 --> 10:41.208
and I know all about the blackmail,
so call me, we'll talk.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.125
Love you. Bye.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.625
I haven't heard back
and I was getting a little concerned.

10:46.709 --> 10:51.041
The girls and I were talking and we
think maybe Paul Young killed Mrs. Huber

10:51.125 --> 10:53.875
and if he did
maybe he killed your old girlfriend too

10:53.959 --> 10:58.250
so we should really talk about this,
so call me. I love you. Bye.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.875
I thought the whole point
of having a cell phone

11:00.959 --> 11:03.208
was so someone could reach you.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.458
How can we move forward
if you won't communicate with me?

11:06.542 --> 11:09.375
Mike, I need you to call me back.
I mean it.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.250
Love you. Bye.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.667
I'm so sorry for that last phone call.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.291
Let's just say it was the worry talking.

11:19.375 --> 11:22.792
I just really need to talk to you.

11:22.875 --> 11:26.125
Can you hang on? I got another call.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.875
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

11:27.959 --> 11:30.500
My God. Where have you been?

11:30.583 --> 11:33.625
The reception's lousy up here
but I got your messages.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.208
I'm really sorry for that last message.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.417
- I was just...
- Stressed out?

11:38.500 --> 11:41.542
Yes, let's call it stressed out.

11:43.208 --> 11:46.125
So how did you get
Martha Huber's journal?

11:46.208 --> 11:49.166
Her sister, Mrs. Tillman,
gave it to me.

11:49.250 --> 11:53.000
She was helping me with my search.

11:53.083 --> 11:56.500
I really think we need
to give it to the police.

11:58.709 --> 11:59.667
Yeah.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.291
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Really?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.625
When I get through with this job,

12:04.709 --> 12:07.875
we'll make an appointment
with that detective. Copeland.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.500
Great. That's great.

12:10.583 --> 12:13.291
All right.
So I'll see you in a few hours.

12:13.375 --> 12:18.625
OK. Hurry, though. I have a feeling Paul
Young is in the middle of all of this.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.917
Well, let's not rush to judgment.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.542
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to testify for you.

12:43.625 --> 12:48.166
Can you take those off?
There's no way I'm dressing him.

12:50.709 --> 12:53.583
Gabby, thank God you're doing this.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.875
Beating up a second gay guy looks bad.

12:58.959 --> 13:01.041
Yes, well, Carlos, in some circles,

13:01.125 --> 13:03.542
beating people up at all
is frowned upon.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.750
So why did you change your mind?

13:06.667 --> 13:08.834
I'm about to be
the mother of your child,

13:08.917 --> 13:12.417
which means a lot of responsibility
and little time for myself.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.959
So if I'm gonna get you out of
this mess, you have to reciprocate.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.250
OK.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.583
When the baby cries
during the night,

13:19.667 --> 13:23.458
you're going to get up,
without saying one word.

13:23.542 --> 13:28.000
Doctor's appointments, you're driving.
I won't put a car seat in my Maserati.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.542
And you will also be on bottle duty.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.417
That means washing,
sterilizing and filling.

13:34.500 --> 13:38.291
I'll have some semblance of a life
and maybe I won't hate you so much.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.083
All right. There we go.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.959
So we're good?

13:46.041 --> 13:48.667
- See you in court.
- Hey, Gabby.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.959
Aren't we breastfeeding?

13:52.083 --> 13:56.458
Honey, if you can swing that one,
more power to you.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.333
Can I buy my own pizza?

14:02.417 --> 14:04.709
You can, honey, if you can pay for it.

14:06.667 --> 14:10.083
That is 19, 19, 19-zip. Bring it.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.500
Just stay here with Penny
for a second, OK?

14:14.917 --> 14:16.709
Tom.

14:16.792 --> 14:21.458
Yes. In your face.
That is 20-zip. Game. Out.

14:21.542 --> 14:24.125
Tom. What are you doin'?

14:24.208 --> 14:27.625
Playing air hockey, what does it
look like? Kevin, you're up.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.458
It's the middle of the day.
Shouldn't you be at work?

14:30.542 --> 14:32.709
No. I quit.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.500
- You did not.
- Yes.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.375
Yesterday.
Told Peterson he could stick it.

14:39.458 --> 14:42.500
Boom. You're not bringing it, Kevin.
Bring it.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.667
Could you talk to me for a second?
I don't understand.

14:45.750 --> 14:49.625
What? You asked Peterson's wife
to make sure he wouldn't promote me.

14:49.709 --> 14:52.417
So he gives a huge promotion
to Annabel so I quit.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.709
What don't you understand?

14:59.792 --> 15:02.542
OK.

15:02.625 --> 15:06.834
OK. Could we go home
and talk about this, please?

15:06.917 --> 15:10.417
No, we can't. Serve it up, meat.

15:11.625 --> 15:15.375
You're just gonna stay here
and play games all day?

15:15.458 --> 15:17.208
No, I'm gonna get some ice cream

15:17.291 --> 15:22.166
and then I'm gonna go to the lake, maybe
rent a boat, do whatever I feel like.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.917
- God.
- Got you.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.041
Tom.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.834
Go home before
I say something I regret. Go home.

15:33.542 --> 15:36.417
All right. You.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.709
You score this next point,
you get your bike back.

15:50.375 --> 15:52.750
What are you thinking about?

15:52.834 --> 15:58.291
I was just thinking that I need
to start spring-cleaning.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.834
- You haven't done that yet?
- No, and I need to clean our gutters

16:01.917 --> 16:03.917
and beneath the refrigerator,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.291
and it's so long since
I replaced the shelf liners so...

16:07.375 --> 16:09.750
You'll finish off
with our wedding silver.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.291
How did you know that?

16:12.375 --> 16:17.208
All those years, you didn't think
I was paying attention. But I was.

16:17.291 --> 16:20.709
- Do you know why I save it for last?
- No.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.083
Because it makes me think
of my Aunt Fern.

16:23.166 --> 16:27.250
On the day we got married,
I told her how happy I was.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.250
She told me that even during bad times

16:30.333 --> 16:33.583
to always remember
that the best was yet to come.

16:33.667 --> 16:39.208
So as I polish it, I think about you
and the kids and our life.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.458
And how right she was.

16:43.417 --> 16:47.166
- They're gonna operate on me.
- I know.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.750
I wanna say some stuff.
I mean, just in case...

16:50.834 --> 16:53.291
Rex, you don't have to say anything.

16:53.375 --> 16:56.917
I'm sorry for everything I did.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.458
The moving out, the infidelity,
the sex stuff.

17:02.542 --> 17:05.291
It doesn't matter.

17:05.375 --> 17:10.083
From here on in,
can we just say that we're even?

17:12.625 --> 17:14.875
- OK.
- Thanks.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.750
And for the record,

17:23.834 --> 17:27.667
you are gonna come through
this operation just fine.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.458
How can you be so sure?

17:31.542 --> 17:36.000
Because I told you.
The best is yet to come.

17:52.417 --> 17:54.375
Don't forget to feed Bongo.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.208
Thanks. I'll go do that now.

17:56.291 --> 18:00.000
Go on in the car, sweetie.
I have to talk to your mum real quick.

18:01.625 --> 18:05.500
So you're gonna go live in sin
with the plumber slash ex-con?

18:05.583 --> 18:10.250
It's funny you should mention sin.
Adultery still falls in that category.

18:10.333 --> 18:14.917
I don't like the idea of this guy
being around Julie 24/7.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.542
He's a good person.

18:17.625 --> 18:21.375
Mike's cool, Dad. He cares about us
a lot and I like having him around.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.375
So don't mess this up.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.583
You heard the girl.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.000
He's still a plumber.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.417
You be a good boy, Bongo.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.041
Or you're gonna go to bed hungry.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.333
Hi, Miss Mayer.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.417
Will you sit down, please?

19:36.750 --> 19:40.458
- I'm just gonna go get some water.
- I'd rather you didn't.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.542
Don't answer it.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.625
I know you're in there, Susan.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.792
I can see you.

20:05.875 --> 20:10.250
If you don't want to talk to me, fine.
At least have the courtesy to hide.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.792
All right, but don't let her in.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.667
Edie, what a pleasant surprise.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.417
Right. Is Mike home?

20:31.333 --> 20:34.375
No. He's on a big plumbing job.
What's up?

20:34.458 --> 20:36.667
- Can I come in?
- Why?

20:36.750 --> 20:40.709
I'm warning all the neighbors.
Felicia Tillman was attacked.

20:40.792 --> 20:43.000
- She was?
- At the Young house.

20:43.083 --> 20:46.166
They took her away in an ambulance.
I'm freaked out.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.208
My guys haven't shown up
at the job site yet.

20:49.291 --> 20:53.458
I'm over there all alone. Could I just
come in and hang out for a while?

20:57.333 --> 20:59.041
Stick it up my... What?

21:00.458 --> 21:03.375
Just get the hell out of here.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.959
God, you are such a bitch.

21:10.875 --> 21:11.875
Why?

21:11.959 --> 21:16.792
I asked Mrs. Tillman to tell me
the truth about my father. She did.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.625
What did she say?

21:19.709 --> 21:22.125
Mr. Delfino took my dad away
to kill him.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.458
Now I'm gonna kill Mr. Delfino.

21:31.458 --> 21:35.000
You Honor, this whole mess
is just a result of my loneliness.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.417
My marriage is a bit strained.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.333
After Carlos was convicted...

21:41.417 --> 21:45.750
No one's been convicted yet, Mrs. Solis.
This is just a grand jury hearing.

21:45.834 --> 21:48.500
No, I'm talking about
his other crime.

21:49.834 --> 21:50.834
Right.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.750
Go ahead.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.083
Anyways,
he was placed under house arrest

21:56.166 --> 21:58.250
and he being the jealous man that he is,

21:58.333 --> 22:01.542
got a little crazy
every time I left the house.

22:01.625 --> 22:05.250
He knows how men look at me and...

22:05.333 --> 22:08.917
Well, I didn't exactly ease his mind.

22:10.583 --> 22:15.792
I falsely led him to believe
I was having an affair.

22:17.625 --> 22:21.875
Before Carlos' house arrest, he was
always working and he was never with me.

22:21.959 --> 22:25.959
I thought that maybe if he believed
I was having an affair

22:27.083 --> 22:28.875
he would realize he loved me.

22:28.959 --> 22:31.291
I know it sounds stupid. I do. I just...

22:31.375 --> 22:33.917
Is there a point to this?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.959
My point is that Carlos
is an angry, jealous Neanderthal.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.041
But he's not a gay-basher.

22:45.542 --> 22:48.458
All right. I've heard enough.
Counsel, approach.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.959
I gotta be honest.
I don't think we have a hate crime here.

23:06.917 --> 23:10.166
Just so you know,
you beat up the wrong guy.

23:10.250 --> 23:13.291
Didn't you think it was strange
that you had the only lawn

23:13.375 --> 23:16.750
that needed to be mowed
three times a week?

23:28.667 --> 23:30.792
You are so dead.

23:32.750 --> 23:35.333
- You are so dead.
- Order.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.041
No. Carlos.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.041
He's doing it again.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.625
For God's sake, somebody stop him.

23:43.709 --> 23:46.208
Stop it.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.959
- We will have order.
- I'll kill you.

23:50.625 --> 23:54.291
- I am going to kill you.
- Order.

23:54.375 --> 23:58.542
Please be seated.
We will have order.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.625
Get out.

24:34.834 --> 24:39.834
I'm not trying to justify anything
but Martha Huber ruined lives.

24:39.917 --> 24:42.917
For fun. She destroyed my family.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.542
- This isn't about her.
- I don't understand.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.458
Walk.

24:53.834 --> 24:58.667
Remember when we first tested you,
your potassium level was a bit high?

24:58.792 --> 25:00.917
Yes. You made me stop eating bananas.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
But as we've continued testing,
it's kept climbing.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.959
We've now run an entire battery of tests

25:07.041 --> 25:09.959
and your kidney function is fine.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.166
It has to be something you're ingesting.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.375
Let me see.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.959
These numbers can't be right.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.917
Who prepares your meals?

25:34.792 --> 25:35.917
Bree.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.959
I understand you've been having
some marital problems.

25:45.417 --> 25:49.000
- Wait a minute.
- Was there an incident at a salad bar?

25:49.083 --> 25:51.959
She gave you onions
when she knew you were allergic.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.000
That was an accident.

25:56.083 --> 25:59.458
You're getting this potassium
from somewhere.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.250
- Get out.
- Rex.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.625
I mean it.

26:04.709 --> 26:06.166
Get out.

26:11.250 --> 26:14.083
Leave the chart.

26:14.166 --> 26:17.083
I want to read it.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
So did you have a fun day?

26:55.625 --> 26:58.333
As a matter of fact, I did.

26:59.959 --> 27:03.458
I probably had the most fun
that I have had in a long time.

27:04.375 --> 27:06.250
You know, I didn't tell you to quit.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.709
No.

27:09.792 --> 27:13.875
But you made damn sure that
I'd go nowhere for the next 20 years.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.333
I don't know what to say.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.750
I hear "Please forgive me" is popular.

27:21.834 --> 27:25.250
Yes, I am sorry. I am so, so sorry.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.208
I didn't want to hurt you.

27:27.291 --> 27:30.417
But I was trying to protect our family.

27:30.500 --> 27:35.083
If you got a promotion, we never would
have seen you. You would have been...

27:35.166 --> 27:36.834
Lynette, you're right.

27:38.166 --> 27:42.083
You're right. You're right. That
promotion would have just killed us.

27:42.166 --> 27:45.375
So this is gonna all work out.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.000
What does that mean?

27:51.083 --> 27:54.291
It means that I can use the break.

27:54.375 --> 27:59.041
Well, yeah. I think it would be good
for you to take some time off.

27:59.125 --> 28:01.125
No, not some time. Full-time.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.917
I'm gonna be a stay-at-home dad.

28:05.834 --> 28:08.917
What the heck?
You earn the living for a while.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.750
Tom, that's crazy.

28:12.834 --> 28:14.583
Why? Why is it crazy?

28:14.667 --> 28:18.041
You and I both know
that you're better at the ad game.

28:18.125 --> 28:21.000
And you tell me all the time
how hard it is to be a mum.

28:21.083 --> 28:24.375
Well, yes, it is hard.
But I love it, too.

28:24.458 --> 28:29.083
I've been doing it for six years and
I haven't complained the entire time.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.333
Fair enough.

28:31.417 --> 28:33.208
But be honest.

28:33.291 --> 28:37.917
Secretly, you miss the ad game,
don't you?

28:38.000 --> 28:43.083
You miss the pressure
and the deadlines and the power lunches.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.250
Or am I wrong?

28:45.333 --> 28:50.125
Maybe you want to sort dirty socks
the rest of your life.

28:52.041 --> 28:56.667
We should talk about this seriously
before we make any rash decisions.

28:56.750 --> 29:00.166
I already made the decision.
You're going back to work.

29:15.125 --> 29:17.834
Can I at least
get you something to eat, Zach?

29:17.917 --> 29:21.417
Maybe a soda. Thanks.

29:30.125 --> 29:33.125
I gotta say,
I think you're making a mistake.

29:33.208 --> 29:35.667
Mike couldn't kill anybody.

29:35.750 --> 29:40.542
I mean, this could just be
a misunderstanding.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.709
This is not a misunderstanding.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.375
I know you're upset,

29:44.458 --> 29:47.750
but is this what you think
your mother would want you doing?

29:48.834 --> 29:51.250
- Probably not.
- Exactly.

29:51.333 --> 29:53.959
Because she raised you right.

29:54.041 --> 29:57.291
Look, you have been through a lot.
You've lost your mum.

29:57.375 --> 30:01.166
You're still carrying the guilt
of what happened to your baby sister.

30:01.250 --> 30:04.500
- I never had a baby sister.
- Honey, I know about Dana.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.709
How stupid are you? I'm Dana.

30:07.792 --> 30:11.291
My mother was some junkie.
They stole me and changed my name.

30:11.375 --> 30:16.417
They have been lying to me
my entire life. Everyone lies to me.

30:16.500 --> 30:20.000
My mother, my father,
Mrs. Tillman, even Julie.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.500
Do you understand how much that hurts?

30:22.583 --> 30:24.750
Look, Zach.

30:24.834 --> 30:28.500
I know you're upset.
Let's just sit down and talk.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.792
Why? So you can lie to me also?

30:36.875 --> 30:39.041
No more talking.

31:31.709 --> 31:35.333
- Hello?
<i>- Bree, it's Dr. Craig.</i>

31:35.417 --> 31:38.959
<i>I'm at the hospital</i>
<i>and I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

31:41.291 --> 31:44.375
<i>Rex passed away ten minutes ago.</i>

31:53.333 --> 31:56.291
But his operation is not until tomorrow.

31:56.375 --> 32:00.375
<i>I know. He just didn't make it.</i>

32:00.458 --> 32:03.500
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>We did everything we could.</i>

32:08.083 --> 32:11.208
<i>- Bree?</i>
- Yes. Of course you did.

32:11.291 --> 32:13.625
Thank you very much for calling.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.709
This is a long way to go to do what you
could have done in my back yard.

34:06.792 --> 34:10.125
You're kind of taking your time.
Walking a lot.

34:10.208 --> 34:15.166
You sure you know what you're doing? You
ever had to kill anyone for real before?

34:16.583 --> 34:18.583
Yeah.

34:21.375 --> 34:25.250
But since you're so tired of walking,
let's just do this here.

34:33.250 --> 34:36.667
I don't expect any favors from you,
obviously.

34:36.750 --> 34:40.625
But could you at least do me the
courtesy of telling me why we're here?

34:50.333 --> 34:52.166
You knew Deidre.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.041
Yeah.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.333
And I know what you did to her.

34:57.542 --> 35:00.041
She was just a sad girl
with a lot of problems.

35:00.125 --> 35:03.291
She did some terrible, crazy,
selfish stuff.

35:03.375 --> 35:07.333
But you tell me what she
ever could have done to deserve death

35:07.417 --> 35:09.667
at the hands of somebody like you.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.625
It's complicated.

35:16.959 --> 35:21.000
It's so complicated.

35:21.083 --> 35:25.792
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>my husband began sharing my secrets.</i>

35:28.166 --> 35:30.125
You want some carrot, Zachary?

35:30.208 --> 35:33.333
<i>Secrets I had died to protect.</i>

35:36.166 --> 35:38.000
There you go.

35:39.291 --> 35:43.375
We have to get that fence up in the
back yard before the pool's finished.

35:43.458 --> 35:46.417
- I know.
- I'm serious.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.291
You know kids are drawn to water.

36:02.959 --> 36:04.500
Hello, Angela.

36:13.959 --> 36:16.458
You did a good job covering your tracks.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.083
I had to spend
a lot of money hunting you down.

36:20.166 --> 36:23.625
Congratulations. You found us.

36:23.709 --> 36:26.792
You know, I never
told the police what happened.

36:26.875 --> 36:27.875
You didn't?

36:27.959 --> 36:30.250
They would have put Dana in foster care.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.917
Or worse, given him to my father.

36:34.041 --> 36:36.709
So I kept our little secret.

36:37.959 --> 36:41.291
Well, we appreciate that.

36:41.375 --> 36:45.542
Anyway, I guess you can see
I've gotten myself cleaned up.

36:46.333 --> 36:48.834
Yes, you look lovely.

36:48.917 --> 36:53.000
I'm not the same person
you knew back then, Angela.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.625
I'm in a good place now.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.333
You can't have him.

37:00.417 --> 37:03.709
I didn't go to the police before
but I can do it now.

37:03.792 --> 37:05.959
- Zach is our son.
- His name is Dana.

37:06.041 --> 37:09.458
If you think I'm giving my baby
to some junkie, you're crazy.

37:09.542 --> 37:11.792
- He's not your baby.
- Just calm down.

37:11.875 --> 37:14.041
You were always so high and mighty,

37:14.125 --> 37:16.458
looking down on us poor degenerates,

37:16.542 --> 37:20.667
pretending you wanted to help when all
you really wanted was to feel superior.

37:20.750 --> 37:24.041
- You self-righteous bitch.
- You're still using.

37:24.125 --> 37:25.959
Go to hell. What are you doing?

37:26.041 --> 37:28.208
- Let me see your arm.
- I said I'm clean.

37:28.291 --> 37:31.166
- Just take it easy.
- Where do you think you're going?

37:31.250 --> 37:33.375
I'm getting my son and taking him home.

37:33.458 --> 37:37.166
- Paul, stop her.
- Please. Come on.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.041
- Sit down.
- Get your hands off me.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.875
We raised him. We're his parents.

37:43.750 --> 37:45.542
Come on.

37:45.625 --> 37:47.583
Paul.

37:53.417 --> 37:57.041
Don't worry. I'll give him a good home.

38:02.125 --> 38:03.500
No.

38:24.917 --> 38:29.166
Mary Alice. What did you do?

38:43.667 --> 38:45.542
Mummy?

38:47.834 --> 38:50.083
It's OK, Zach.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.709
Mummy needs to borrow your toy chest.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.500
You go back to sleep, OK?

39:11.041 --> 39:13.208
What are we gonna do?

39:14.458 --> 39:18.125
You said they were pouring the concrete
for the pool tomorrow?

39:18.208 --> 39:21.041
- You can't be serious.
- They'll never find her.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.625
- We can put her in this.
- She won't fit.

39:25.709 --> 39:27.834
Then we'll have to make her fit.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.583
- What are you doing?
- Checking for track marks.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.917
Deidre had a baby?

40:19.709 --> 40:21.834
Let's get this over with.

40:56.625 --> 40:59.709
<i>It's an odd thing</i>
<i>to look back on the world,</i>

40:59.792 --> 41:02.709
<i>to watch those I left behind,</i>

41:02.792 --> 41:07.625
<i>each, in her own way,</i>
<i>so brave, so determined,</i>

41:07.709 --> 41:10.583
<i>and so very desperate.</i>

41:14.375 --> 41:16.583
<i>Desperate to venture out,</i>

41:16.667 --> 41:19.834
<i>but afraid of what she'll miss</i>
<i>when she goes.</i>

41:22.333 --> 41:25.750
<i>Desperate to get everything she wants,</i>

41:25.834 --> 41:30.500
<i>even when she's not exactly sure</i>
<i>of what that is.</i>

41:34.208 --> 41:38.333
<i>Desperate for life to be perfect again,</i>

41:38.417 --> 41:42.959
<i>although she realizes</i>
<i>it never really was.</i>

41:46.792 --> 41:49.792
<i>Desperate for a better future,</i>

41:49.875 --> 41:54.125
<i>if she can find a way</i>
<i>to escape her past.</i>

41:57.792 --> 42:03.709
<i>I not only watch, I cheer them on,</i>
<i>these amazing women.</i>

42:06.041 --> 42:10.500
<i>I hope so much</i>
<i>they'll find what they're looking for.</i>

42:12.792 --> 42:15.667
<i>But I know not all of them will.</i>

42:17.875 --> 42:19.667
<i>Sadly...</i>

42:22.083 --> 42:25.250
<i>that's just not the way life works.</i>

42:26.709 --> 42:30.750
<i>Not everyone gets a happy ending.</i>
