08:49.329 --> 08:51.363
You are what makes
this country great.
Oh, come on, Mike.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.566
You know assimilation takes
time -- a generation or two.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.368
I mean,
germans fresh off the boat

08:56.370 --> 08:57.836
Still spoke german
in the home.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.038
Yeah, but I think the germans
somewhere in their minds

09:00.040 --> 09:04.509
Thought one day we'd, uh,
all be "speaking german."

09:04.511 --> 09:06.344
I think it's better
for the melting pot

09:06.346 --> 09:08.213
When immigrants preserve
elements of their culture.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.048
I got it. W-when your folks
got here from Spain,

09:10.050 --> 09:12.317
What elements of their culture
did they preserve?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.319
Their hatred
of the portuguese.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.657
Come on, people.
Look sharp here.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.060
Who left the backpack here?
We do b--

09:22.062 --> 09:23.562
Ha! Gotcha, Mike!
Whoa. Hey, hey!

09:23.564 --> 09:24.663
Hey, man!

09:24.665 --> 09:26.665
Hi, Mike.
You doing all right, man?

09:26.667 --> 09:29.100
I'm doing good, yeah. What,
the homeless shelter shut down?

09:30.369 --> 09:32.404
Now, look, if you was
a 10-point buck,

09:32.406 --> 09:35.073
We'd be field dressing you
right now.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.242
Uh, actually, I've hunted
with you guys before.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.078
You'd have to get a lot closer
than this to a deer to kill it.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.580
Ha!
Maybe.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.415
'cause deer are smart
and they move fast.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.519
You? I'd have you on the hood
of my truck, son.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.120
So, uh, deer season.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.722
I guess you guys
are ready for that?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.123
Let's go.
We want to get geared up.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.291
All right. Kyle!

09:53.293 --> 09:55.527
You remember these boys.
Yeah!

09:55.529 --> 09:57.562
How could I forget
our two best customers?

09:57.564 --> 09:59.698
And who could forget...

10:00.766 --> 10:02.968
Kyle?

10:02.970 --> 10:05.303
You know, I just said his name
three seconds ago.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.303
I haven't seen you guys

10:06.305 --> 10:09.140
Since you took me hunting
for jackass-alope.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.976
I can't believe
we didn't even see one.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.777
Oh, we saw one.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.579
Anyways, I want you
to outfit these guys,

10:14.581 --> 10:17.616
Get 'em all ready for that
man-vs.-Nature battle.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.285
Now, look here. We don't want
nature to have a chance.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.486
Right.
Right.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.289
I see you guys already got
your sweet hunting camo.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.059
Hunting camo?
This is my Sunday best.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.395
Yeah, we just came
from church.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.395
Oh.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.365
[ laughs ]
we're just joking with you.
Yeah.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.434
You still dating
Baxter's daughter?

10:36.436 --> 10:38.136
Sure am.
Mandy's in college now.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.271
She's been telling me
about philosophy.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.073
It's really
opened my mind.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.076
Then all the butterflies
flew out.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.278
My philosophy is,
"hey, if it ain't broke,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.547
Hey, you got hosed
buying the warranty."

10:50.449 --> 10:52.350
All right, look,
I'm gonna need some thermals,

10:52.352 --> 10:55.020
'cause we're gonna be
in the woods for a week,

10:55.022 --> 10:57.756
And I ain't spooning
with this cat.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.358
When you're up there,
just remember --

11:00.360 --> 11:02.260
When you're looking
into the abyss,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.629
The abyss also looks
into you.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.732
Yep. I'm looking into an abyss
right now.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.869
Right between
your ears.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.937
You just quoted
nietzsche?

11:12.939 --> 11:14.839
No. Mandy.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.474
Hmm.
Hey, Baxter,

11:16.476 --> 11:20.111
Can we get somebody besides
ladybeard here to help us?

11:22.948 --> 11:24.783
Hey, babe.
Hey.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.317
Did you get Boyd to school
on time?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.953
Yep. We were early.
He even got a desk.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.723
Oh, nice hustle, honey.
Mm.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.459
So, uh,
my dad's coming over.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.362
Here?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.563
Yeah.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.532
Well, what do you think
he wants?

11:40.534 --> 11:43.201
I imagine that will come up
when he gets here.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.170
Well, how do I look?!

11:45.172 --> 11:48.573
Adorable, but [chuckles]
why do you care?

11:48.575 --> 11:50.408
It's the first time him visiting
since we moved in.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.477
It's a little weird,
him just showing up.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.879
You know, I-I mean, what's
his game? What's his angle?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.414
F-friendliness?

11:57.349 --> 11:59.417
Oh, no. You're right.
What <i>is</i> his angle?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.352
Okay, well,
whatever he throws at us,

12:01.354 --> 12:03.221
We need to maintain
a united front.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.556
Okay.
I'll be right behind you.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.557
[ doorbell rings ]
great.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.059
That means
he'll kill me first.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.396
Hey!

12:11.398 --> 12:12.397
Kristin: Hey.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.532
A little
housewarming gift.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.500
[ chuckles ]
hey.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.701
Hey. Thanks, dad.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.670
Felt a little weird
carrying a bottle of wine

12:18.672 --> 12:22.674
In this neighborhood without
being sprawled on the sidewalk.

12:22.676 --> 12:26.111
Welcome, Mike.
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

12:26.113 --> 12:27.846
Great.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.281
Anyhow, listen.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.884
Speaking of <i>su casa,</i>
<i>uh, your mom and I would like</i>

12:32.886 --> 12:36.588
To offer you our <i>casa --</i>
<i>or at least the address --</i>

12:36.590 --> 12:38.690
In case
you want to send Boyd

12:38.692 --> 12:40.692
To the elementary school
in our neighborhood.

12:40.694 --> 12:41.760
[ sighs ]

12:41.762 --> 12:44.295
You mean lie
to the school district?

12:44.297 --> 12:47.665
[ scoffs ] well, it's not
exactly the lufthansa heist.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.401
People do this
all the time.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.404
And besides, I think...

12:53.406 --> 12:56.040
Your mom might like to have Boyd
a couple nights a week.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.876
Oh, it would make
mom happy, huh?

12:57.878 --> 13:00.111
She'd love it.
She really would.
Yeah, okay, dad,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.113
Ryan and I like
Boyd going to wilson

13:02.115 --> 13:03.581
Because
it's multicultural.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.583
[ scoffs ]
it's only multicultural now

13:05.585 --> 13:07.685
Because
Boyd is going there.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.789
This is not
up for debate.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.457
Ryan and I are completely
together on this.
I'm not gonna debate.
L-listen. Listen. I just --

13:12.459 --> 13:14.626
We want to be a part
of the solution at wilson,

13:14.628 --> 13:16.995
Not a part of the problem,
right, Ryan?

13:20.566 --> 13:21.733
Wait. We could --
we could do that?

13:21.735 --> 13:23.835
We could use your address?
Yeah.

13:23.837 --> 13:28.006
But we don't want to because
we're happy with our school.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.440
Well, we kind of
had to be happy

13:29.442 --> 13:31.442
Because that was
our only option, Kris.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.646
Should we have gone over the
definition of "united front"?

13:34.648 --> 13:36.114
Honey, face it.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.116
Wilson is overcrowded,
and the faculty is overwhelmed.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.753
I mean, at my first p.T.A.
Meeting, I was the only "p."

13:41.755 --> 13:45.857
So you were all alone
with just "t" and "a"?

13:50.296 --> 13:52.096
Come on.
Let's be real.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.464
H-he should
be able to go to a school

13:53.466 --> 13:54.866
Where he can have a desk
every day

13:54.868 --> 13:57.101
And 6th graders don't steal
your lunch money.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.503
Boyd was robbed?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.737
No. Me.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.474
But these girls
were really aggressive.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.945
But, Ryan, what ever happened
to "it takes a village"?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.179
It does take a village.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.181
I just think that
when it comes to our son,

14:10.183 --> 14:12.784
I'd prefer to be
in your dad's village.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.552
We really have
a great village,

14:14.554 --> 14:17.388
Although you got to look pretty
hard to find a good bum fight.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.290
Oh, oh,
so people in other villages

14:19.292 --> 14:21.492
Aren't as good as the people
in your village?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.528
They just don't build
as good of schools.
See?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.296
This is why I moved Boyd
out of your house,

14:25.298 --> 14:26.698
So that he wouldn't
have to grow up

14:26.700 --> 14:29.567
Listening to toxic ideas
like that one.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.338
Well, it's your call.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.206
I was just looking out
for Boyd.
No, no, no.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.641
You were just looking out
for yourself, dad.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.409
Okay, this isn't about clark
and wilson.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.746
This is about you wanting Boyd
around your house more.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.182
Tucked that kid in
for five years.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.652
Maybe I'm having a tough time
letting that go.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.756
[ scoffs ] I can't believe
you just ganged up on me

14:51.758 --> 14:53.524
In front of my dad like that!
Aw, come on, Kris.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.326
You would jump at the idea
of switching schools

14:55.328 --> 14:56.561
If it came from anybody
but your father.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.162
That is not true!

14:58.164 --> 14:59.564
No, that <i>is</i> true.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.099
We both know that clark
is a better school,

15:01.101 --> 15:02.600
And you're just disagreeing
with your dad

15:02.602 --> 15:03.835
Just to disagree
with him.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.503
I mean, he says, "up,"
and you say, "down."

15:05.505 --> 15:07.005
You go against him
just to drive him crazy

15:07.007 --> 15:08.640
Even when he's right.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.509
Wait.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.746
That's not the reason
you're with <i>me,</i> is it?

15:26.191 --> 15:28.359
I kicked a hornet's nest
by just suggesting

15:28.361 --> 15:31.062
That Boyd attend
another elementary school.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.230
Well,
if there's one thing

15:32.232 --> 15:33.798
That mothers have
a high tolerance for,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.567
It's unwanted tips
about their parenting.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.569
She called
my involvement toxic.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.771
Well, of course it is.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.406
You've been
a terrible father --

15:41.408 --> 15:42.573
Food, shelter,
ballet lessons.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.176
I'm gonna call the cops
on you.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.548
Hey, boys. Welcome back.
You    <i>a</i>my best customers.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.884
Well, this time,
we <i>are</i> gonna get a deer.

15:52.886 --> 15:55.086
Okay, if you scatter shots
actually bag a buck,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.822
I will cook you my world-famous
chicken-fried venison.

15:57.824 --> 16:01.225
It's only world-famous 'cause
you won't shut up about it.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.563
Hey. What's with ladybeard
over here?

16:05.565 --> 16:06.764
What's his problem?

16:06.766 --> 16:09.100
Been in that boat
a couple hours.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.302
My daughter
broke his brain.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.470
Well, in all fairness,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.740
I think it come from the factory
a little wonky.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.109
I think
we can talk to him.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.078
We're pretty good
at coaxing nervous critters

16:20.080 --> 16:22.847
Out of their dens.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.749
And then
we shoot 'em.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.518
Let's skip that step.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.188
Mike, I can't promise
the instinct won't kick in.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.191
Kyle,
what are you doing?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.793
Exactly.
What are any of us doing?

16:35.795 --> 16:38.429
I just keep thinking about
all this philosophy stuff.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.799
Life is meaningless
and an empty void of despair.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.169
This kid
is a major bummer.

16:45.171 --> 16:49.173
Kyle -- Kyle, come on.
You're only 22.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.676
Things are gonna get
a lot worse.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.613
Kyle, look,
before Baxter's daughter

16:55.615 --> 16:57.815
Shorted
all your wires out,

16:57.817 --> 17:00.218
What gave your life
meaning?

17:00.220 --> 17:02.487
I don't know. I-I guess
I always found meaning

17:02.489 --> 17:04.622
In what I learned
at Sunday school.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.857
That's it.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.859
Like mark 12:31 --

17:07.861 --> 17:09.627
"love your neighbor
as yourself."

17:09.629 --> 17:10.962
Yeah,
that's a good one.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.498
That mark had better
neighbors than me.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.967
I'm your neighbor.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.336
Hey, you're making
my point.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.905
Stick with
the big man upstairs,

17:20.907 --> 17:22.707
You'll never have
another day of your life

17:22.709 --> 17:24.242
That won't have purpose.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.410
Yeah.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.545
Jesus is pretty awesome.
Oh, yeah.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.480
You take a cue from
the greatest philosopher

17:29.482 --> 17:30.481
That ever walked
the earth.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.484
My apologies to...
Newt gingrich.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.753
Thanks, guys.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.088
I'm back, mr. B.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.424
Good.
Because you owe me two hours.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.691
You got it.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.527
"I can do all things
through him who strengthens me."

17:42.529 --> 17:44.195
Philippians 4:13.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.998
That's right. You go weird on me
again, you're fired!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.333
Mike Baxter, 12:25.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.339
Ooh.
Oh.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.210
Hi, dad.
Uh, I still have my key.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.412
Should I have rung the doorbell?
Just seems kind of weird.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.681
Kris, this is always gonna
be your house, all right?

18:03.683 --> 18:06.851
Even though I've got a foosball
table where your bed used to be.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.555
So, dad,
uh, Ryan and I talked,

18:10.557 --> 18:13.591
And we signed Boyd up
for clark today.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.594
So...You won.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.196
Boyd's the winner here.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.630
And so am I.

18:22.468 --> 18:23.868
Dad,
about this morning,

18:23.870 --> 18:26.471
I should never
have called you toxic.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.439
Because it's not true?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.442
I just shouldn't
have said it.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.412
Yes, you have your things
you feel strongly about

18:34.414 --> 18:36.247
That I think are insane.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.050
You know, funny. This
started off sounding like
it was gonna be an apology.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.052
And sometimes you say things
in front of Boyd

18:41.054 --> 18:43.121
That -- that make
my skin crawl.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.723
Boy, still not
the apology words.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.560
But you can also
be amazingly great.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.496
That's all part of the package
of Mike Baxter,

18:51.498 --> 18:54.632
A package I definitely want
in Boyd's life.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.467
So...

18:56.469 --> 18:57.668
I'm sorry.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.071
There it is.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.574
And don't worry
about calling me toxic.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.944
Your mom calls me toxic
all the time.

19:06.946 --> 19:10.948
Of course,
we share a bathroom.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.584
Hey, honey.
Oh, hey.
Ooh, I almost forgot.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.586
I got something
for you guys.
What? What? What?

19:15.588 --> 19:18.589
It is a gift certificate
to toy world.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.325
[ gasps, chuckles ]

19:22.828 --> 19:26.030
Uh, wow. I've been meaning
to sneak into that place.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.331
I -- [ laughs ]

19:27.333 --> 19:31.335
Oh! No!
Not <i>that</i> toy world!

19:31.337 --> 19:33.204
Mom!

19:33.206 --> 19:36.807
I-I thought that you guys
could go with Boyd

19:36.809 --> 19:39.477
To pick something out...
Oh.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.645
...Since he's gonna
be spending more time here

19:40.647 --> 19:43.181
Before and after school.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.551
Oh, yay!
Oh, good! Good!

19:46.553 --> 19:48.486
Good!

19:48.488 --> 19:50.221
He loves "go, diego, go!"

19:50.223 --> 19:51.656
Of course he does.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.224
Now that diego's here...

19:53.226 --> 19:55.293
He's not going anywhere.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.302
Hmm. Hmm.
Hi, Blanca.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.870
Welcome home, mr. Mike.
I have your favorite --

20:05.872 --> 20:08.306
A frosted mug
and spiced nuts on the tray.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.075
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.878
You know, when an American woman
serves your nuts on a tray,

20:13.880 --> 20:17.648
It means something
totally different.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.052
Ha! But, mr. Mike, an American
woman <i>did</i> serve nuts to you.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.653
No way!
Mm-hmm!

20:22.655 --> 20:24.055
Oh, congratulations!

20:24.057 --> 20:26.057
Oh, thank you!
Ohh!

20:26.059 --> 20:28.893
Wow!
That is such good news!

20:28.895 --> 20:31.262
Well, it's good to be here --
I mean, to <i>really</i> be here.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.897
Now you're part
of the club!
Mm-hmm.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.098
Confidentially...
Hmm?

20:34.100 --> 20:36.467
...At the alamo,
we weren't really trying.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.709
Shake a leg there, Baxter.
We're hungry.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.345
Yeah, dad. This chicken-fried
buck died a hero.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.546
Let's eat him
while he's still warm.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.449
Wow. That actually smells
really good.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.084
Just pretend
it doesn't have a face.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.286
You're on a roll
abandoning your principles.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.390
Any comfort to you --
he didn't have a face long.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.392
All right. Listen up.
Um, before we get started,

21:01.394 --> 21:03.060
I just want to say
whether you've been in America

21:03.062 --> 21:05.062
For hundreds of years
like your families

21:05.064 --> 21:08.399
Or an American
for just two days,

21:08.401 --> 21:11.702
I feel blessed to be sharing
this country with all of you.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.704
Want to do the honors?
Sure.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.906
Let us pray.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.075
Lord, our god is one god.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.477
We pray that we love you

21:19.479 --> 21:21.779
With all our hearts, soul,
mind, and strength.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.448
We pray that we love
our neighbor as ourself,

21:24.450 --> 21:26.617
And there's no greater
commandment than this.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.252
Amen.
All: Amen.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.253
All right.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.322
Vanessa: Okay. Oh, my.
Okay. Dig in.
