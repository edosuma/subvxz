00:16.571 --> 00:18.682
Okay, everybody.
I'll see you next week.

00:21.659 --> 00:23.091
Isn't Reverend Timtom amazing?

00:23.201 --> 00:24.843
Eh, beats grocery shopping with mom.

00:24.968 --> 00:26.400
Ever since I outgrew the cart,

00:26.519 --> 00:28.556
it is much harder to read and walk.

00:29.889 --> 00:32.146
Hey there, Brick.
Can we rap a sec?

00:32.259 --> 00:33.750
I can rap a second, Reverend Timtom.

00:33.880 --> 00:34.671
What's up?

00:34.794 --> 00:35.545
Hello, Sue Heck.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.303
I actually have a question for Brick.

00:38.476 --> 00:40.358
You know, our Christmas
pageant's coming up...

00:40.476 --> 00:42.625
"JC's Rockin' Birthday Jam."

00:42.818 --> 00:45.112
And I'd sure dig it
if you'd be one of my wise men.

00:45.232 --> 00:46.128
'Cause, Brick,

00:46.254 --> 00:47.868
you're the wisest man I know.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.497
Well, it is the holiday season,

00:50.618 --> 00:52.138
and I'm not as busy as I'd like to be,

00:52.254 --> 00:53.422
so, sure.

00:53.588 --> 00:55.672
Wait. I'm not as busy
as I'd like to be, either.

00:55.777 --> 00:57.722
- Can I be in it?
- I'd sure love that,

00:57.844 --> 01:00.014
but it's only for kids 12 and under.

01:00.971 --> 01:03.173
Pfft.

01:03.433 --> 01:04.421
Cool.

01:04.525 --> 01:05.730
Yeah. No prob.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.664
But hey. Not to worry.

01:07.798 --> 01:11.162
I saved a very important job for you.

01:11.315 --> 01:12.266
Really?

01:12.387 --> 01:13.531
How would you feel

01:13.672 --> 01:16.554
about makin' cookies
for the concession stand?

01:16.683 --> 01:18.617
Ha! I love cookies!

01:18.770 --> 01:20.074
And concession stands.

01:20.204 --> 01:21.753
I knew I could count on you, Sue Heck.

01:21.906 --> 01:22.875
And I'm really psyched

01:22.931 --> 01:24.331
about you being in the play, Brick.

01:25.382 --> 01:26.917
What play?

01:30.795 --> 01:33.560
Well, I've paid the minimums
on all the credit cards,

01:33.699 --> 01:35.322
sent in my first tuition payment

01:35.432 --> 01:37.458
and conveniently
forgot to sign the check,

01:37.570 --> 01:39.053
so I think it'll buy us another week.

01:39.170 --> 01:39.928
Attagirl!

01:40.037 --> 01:44.080
And we still have $20 left
to buy Christmas presents.

01:44.226 --> 01:45.666
Okay, maybe a little more than that,

01:45.766 --> 01:49.059
but seriously, Mike, not our best year.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.242
Did we have a best year?

01:52.323 --> 01:54.203
Well, we're just gonna have
to come with a way

01:54.204 --> 01:55.364
to do Christmas on the cheap.

01:55.403 --> 01:57.891
I mean, the kids are older now.
They'll get it, right?

01:58.097 --> 02:00.785
Hey, maybe we give 'em homemade gifts?

02:00.892 --> 02:02.198
You know, from the heart?

02:02.392 --> 02:03.752
They're still gonna want presents.

02:03.753 --> 02:06.474
Okay, well, how about we...
we go outside

02:06.603 --> 02:09.027
and throw snowballs
and make snow angels

02:09.148 --> 02:11.603
and create a magical Christmas memory?

02:11.735 --> 02:13.122
They're still gonna want presents.

02:13.310 --> 02:15.084
Okay. All right.
Go with me here...

02:15.246 --> 02:18.651
I... fake my own death,

02:18.652 --> 02:20.412
and then I just show up
on Christmas day...

02:20.526 --> 02:21.962
"Surprise! I'm alive!"

02:22.068 --> 02:23.420
"Glad you're not dead, mom!

02:23.534 --> 02:24.829
Now where's my presents?"

02:24.958 --> 02:26.353
Okay. We'll figure
something out.

02:28.392 --> 02:29.748
Guess what?

02:29.855 --> 02:31.975
Reverend Timtom's
doing this cool Christmas pageant,

02:31.976 --> 02:33.229
"JC's Rockin' Birthday Jam."

02:33.383 --> 02:35.023
Brick's in it.
He's gonna be a wise man.

02:35.024 --> 02:38.352
But get this...
I... am making the cookies!

02:39.639 --> 02:41.206
Brick's gonna be in a <i>play?</i>

02:41.309 --> 02:44.053
And I'm making the cookies!
Ha! Can you believe it?

02:44.163 --> 02:45.380
Yeah, wow, Sue.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.976
So do you have a part?

02:47.075 --> 02:47.908
I'm the wise man

02:48.019 --> 02:50.165
who brings frankincense
to the baby Jesus.

02:50.318 --> 02:51.739
I really wanted myrrh.

02:51.932 --> 02:52.888
Myrrh.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.086
Mom, where do you keep
the cookie cutters?

02:55.227 --> 02:56.229
The store.

02:58.844 --> 03:00.576
I don't know, Frankie.

03:00.683 --> 03:01.901
Brick in a play?

03:02.028 --> 03:03.468
In front of people?
People we know?

03:03.588 --> 03:05.816
I know. It doesn't sound
like a great idea

03:05.947 --> 03:07.138
when you're just hearing it.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.932
But who knows?
It could be his thing.

03:10.089 --> 03:12.832
All those actors
in Hollywood are weird, right?

03:12.948 --> 03:13.970
Brick's weird.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.339
Yeah, he's definitely that.

03:15.707 --> 03:17.814
I don't know, Mike.
I think he might surprise us.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.165
- He won't.
- Wh...

03:22.551 --> 03:23.502
Where are you going?

03:23.621 --> 03:25.536
I told Rusty I'd help him
move some furniture.

03:25.675 --> 03:26.910
Yeah, 'cause everyone knows

03:27.024 --> 03:29.552
the best time to move furniture
is when it's dark out.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.076
I guess some friend of his

03:31.179 --> 03:32.979
is giving him some old stuff
from his place,

03:33.097 --> 03:34.610
and he wants the stuff moved out

03:34.727 --> 03:35.937
before he gets back into town.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.729
This is ridiculous.
Seriously, Mike,

03:37.855 --> 03:39.407
what is wrong with your brother?

03:39.624 --> 03:42.434
The "what's <i>not</i> wrong with him"
list is shorter.

03:42.629 --> 03:45.486
Hey, Axl. I was thinking.

03:45.674 --> 03:46.394
What if this year,

03:46.395 --> 03:48.195
we do something different
Christmas morning?

03:48.262 --> 03:51.220
We wake up, rush outside,
make snow angels,

03:51.331 --> 03:53.011
drink hot cocoa
with little marshmallows,

03:53.116 --> 03:55.432
and create some
wonderful Christmas memories?

03:55.657 --> 03:57.781
Cool. Then we come inside
and open presents?

04:02.273 --> 04:03.633
How about this lamp?
Is it going?

04:03.739 --> 04:05.085
Yeah, sure.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.198
Is he giving you the lamp or not?

04:07.329 --> 04:08.640
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:14.242 --> 04:16.197
Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.387
Man.

04:19.502 --> 04:22.141
You still carrying that matchbox
car around in your pocket?

04:22.265 --> 04:23.945
You've had that thing
since we were kids.

04:23.946 --> 04:26.364
Yeah, I like
to fiddle around with it

04:26.476 --> 04:28.830
when I'm in line and stuff.
Nervous habit.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.572
- It's that or smoking.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.976
Actually, it's that <i>and</i> smoking.

04:36.993 --> 04:39.031
And you said
it wouldn't fit.

04:39.139 --> 04:40.586
Somebody owes me breakfast.

04:40.756 --> 04:42.225
Yeah, I owe you.

04:42.357 --> 04:44.061
Seem kind of crabby tonight, Mike.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.145
Somethin' wrong?

04:45.247 --> 04:46.727
Yeah, there's something wrong, Rusty.

04:46.845 --> 04:49.125
I didn't know we were gonna be
moving all this furniture

04:49.126 --> 04:49.726
into my garage.

04:49.727 --> 04:51.314
Well, we haven't
moved our old stuff

04:51.450 --> 04:53.917
out of Marlene's yet.
I guess I forgot to tell ya.

04:55.121 --> 04:57.010
Okay, let's get this garage door down.

04:57.123 --> 04:58.843
We wouldn't want people
knowing it's here.

04:58.844 --> 04:59.759
Hang on.

04:59.892 --> 05:02.249
Why wouldn't we want people
knowing it's here?

05:02.442 --> 05:03.902
This is your stuff, right?

05:04.030 --> 05:06.685
Yes.
I won it fair and square.

05:06.852 --> 05:08.333
What do you mean, you "won it"?

05:08.449 --> 05:09.729
Well, me and a bunch of the guys

05:09.832 --> 05:12.435
were playin' poker,
and I called acey deucey.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.570
Sure, I had a lot
of corn nuts in my mouth,

05:14.698 --> 05:16.049
but everybody heard me.

05:16.171 --> 05:18.261
- And if you asked
the guy we took it from,

05:18.262 --> 05:20.062
- what would he say?
- He'd say we stole it.

05:20.275 --> 05:22.391
And what would the other people
at the table say?

05:22.506 --> 05:23.946
Well, they'd probably side with him.

05:23.971 --> 05:25.378
You know how cops stick together.

05:26.261 --> 05:27.981
You telling me
we broke into a cop's house

05:28.101 --> 05:29.864
and stole his furniture?
Are you nuts?!

05:29.988 --> 05:31.951
Now look, any jury that plays poker

05:32.239 --> 05:33.204
would side with me.

05:33.368 --> 05:35.522
I'm not keeping this stuff
in my garage, Rusty.

05:35.622 --> 05:36.732
It's going back now.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.679
I can't now.
I gotta get the truck back

05:38.680 --> 05:40.720
before the guy who owns it
finds out it's missing.

05:40.825 --> 05:42.156
So you stole a truck, too?

05:42.293 --> 05:44.807
Well, he'd say that, but he owes me.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.408
You know those guys that take and take

05:47.525 --> 05:49.187
and never give back?

05:49.366 --> 05:51.468
Yeah. I think I do.

06:00.106 --> 06:03.017
Okay, I figure 20 cast members,
2 parents each.

06:03.159 --> 06:05.197
Siblings, 1.5 grandparents,

06:05.338 --> 06:06.713
crew members, church people,

06:06.856 --> 06:08.780
5% accidental crumblage.

06:08.909 --> 06:11.262
Okay, I am going to need...

06:11.516 --> 06:14.269
1,200 cookies. Ha ha!

06:15.257 --> 06:16.123
Sue, quilt.

06:16.237 --> 06:17.397
Sorry.

06:23.266 --> 06:27.111
So... guess who got hired
at JJ Macky's?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.140
Why do people say "guess who"?
I know it's you.

06:29.141 --> 06:30.995
Can't you just
have fun with this?

06:31.135 --> 06:33.265
Look, they're hiring
extra help for the holidays.

06:33.388 --> 06:34.228
And the best part is,

06:34.251 --> 06:36.443
I get an additional 30% discount

06:36.570 --> 06:38.459
off their already low, low prices.

06:38.563 --> 06:39.598
Yep!

06:39.737 --> 06:42.413
We're gonna score our kids
some Christmas presents, baby.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.206
See? What did I tell ya?

06:57.332 --> 06:58.774
Weird.

06:59.718 --> 07:02.483
Hi, Penny?
I'm Frankie.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.000
It's my first day. I guess
we're gonna be working together.

07:05.001 --> 07:06.525
Well, welcome aboard, Frankie.

07:06.637 --> 07:08.115
You're gonna love working here.

07:08.251 --> 07:10.291
We like to think of ourselves
as a big ol' family.

07:10.665 --> 07:11.838
Great.

07:11.972 --> 07:14.400
So just picking up
a few things on my break.

07:14.494 --> 07:15.814
I'm getting this for my daughter.

07:15.815 --> 07:17.047
She loves rainbows.

07:17.238 --> 07:19.601
And my son's been wanting
this clock radio

07:19.760 --> 07:22.045
that projects the time
up onto the ceiling,

07:22.120 --> 07:23.240
'cause I guess it's too much

07:23.349 --> 07:25.244
to roll over and see that it's noon.

07:25.377 --> 07:26.634
Right.

07:26.836 --> 07:29.873
All right.
Okay, that's $78.96.

07:29.974 --> 07:32.183
Hold on. I think
you forgot my employee discount.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.777
Yeah, that doesn't
kick in for 20 days.

07:35.003 --> 07:36.551
20 days?

07:36.795 --> 07:39.472
That's all the way
up to... Christmas Eve.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.730
Yeah, I know.

07:40.849 --> 07:42.249
See, people used to take these jobs

07:42.250 --> 07:43.690
just so they can buy their presents,

07:43.814 --> 07:46.000
- and then quit.
- What?

07:46.153 --> 07:47.310
Well, that's not me.

07:47.493 --> 07:49.443
If anything, I wanna be a lifer.

07:49.614 --> 07:51.274
- There's nothing
I would like better

07:51.402 --> 07:54.358
than to just grow old and die here.

07:54.667 --> 07:55.588
Well, if you do,

07:55.743 --> 07:57.524
we all sign a vest, frame it,

07:57.643 --> 07:59.116
and give it to your family.

08:04.257 --> 08:05.337
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

08:05.476 --> 08:08.626
<i>Mike's brother Rusty</i>
<i>was at his most rustiest.</i>

08:09.580 --> 08:10.561
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>

08:10.739 --> 08:12.774
<i>I was on my way over</i>
<i>to get that furniture,</i>

08:12.908 --> 08:16.764
<i>but then I realized</i>
<i>I don't have any shoes.</i>

08:16.943 --> 08:18.682
<i>I'll keep you posted.</i>

08:18.785 --> 08:20.916
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>
<i>Good news. I got the truck.</i>

08:21.047 --> 08:23.379
<i>But then dad asked me to</i>
<i>help him pick up folding chairs</i>

08:23.508 --> 08:25.413
<i>at a funeral home in Lafayette.</i>

08:25.584 --> 08:28.918
<i>Bad news... we're stranded
in Lafayette.</i>

08:29.036 --> 08:30.386
<i>I'll keep you posted.</i>

08:30.573 --> 08:32.433
<i>Hey, sorry I haven't called</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

08:32.549 --> 08:35.249
<i>I lost your number,</i>
<i>but then I found it.</i>

08:35.364 --> 08:38.558
<i>- Anyway, today's not good.
- I'll keep you posted.</i>

08:41.058 --> 08:42.519
What are you doing?

08:42.717 --> 08:44.232
Chillin' in my new crib.

08:44.514 --> 08:46.556
Your "crib" is full
of stolen furniture.

08:46.675 --> 08:47.883
Hey! It's not stolen,

08:47.884 --> 08:49.404
'cause Uncle Rusty called acey deucey.

08:49.535 --> 08:51.015
Now could you close the door, please?

08:51.016 --> 08:52.531
I'm not paying to heat the world.

08:54.552 --> 08:57.134
<i>Well, the days until Christmas</i>
<i>were going by fast,</i>

08:57.280 --> 08:59.481
<i>and so were all my Christmas presents.</i>

08:59.596 --> 09:02.041
I'm not sure about the size,
but this is the only one left.

09:02.192 --> 09:03.305
How do I look?

09:03.423 --> 09:05.984
Fat.
I mean, you're not fat.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.542
The sweatshirt makes you <i>look</i> fat.

09:07.664 --> 09:10.720
And that rainbow pattern?
A little young for you.

09:10.872 --> 09:12.768
It is a little young for me.

09:12.948 --> 09:14.902
I'll get it for my niece.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.910
A clock radio.

09:19.081 --> 09:22.065
<i>My hopes of a discount</i>
<i>Christmas were fading fast.</i>

09:22.188 --> 09:23.778
<i>All I wanted to do was kick up my feet</i>

09:23.903 --> 09:25.554
<i>with a can of frosting.</i>

09:25.920 --> 09:28.823
<i>But Sue had already used up all my
cabinet frosting.</i>

09:29.040 --> 09:31.840
<i>So I had to go deep into my reserves.</i>

09:35.119 --> 09:36.701
Seriously?

09:36.939 --> 09:38.564
Coming together, right?

09:38.680 --> 09:41.029
Masculine, yet with a touch of whimsy.

09:42.402 --> 09:44.313
Your frosting's not there.

09:44.462 --> 09:46.262
I put that and your other stuff
in the back,

09:46.263 --> 09:48.029
'cause it was an eyesore.

09:48.290 --> 09:50.837
And, instead of
a new amp for Christmas,

09:50.968 --> 09:52.169
I'd like an accent rug.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.925
You know, really help define the space.

09:55.048 --> 09:56.328
Yeah, well, don't get too comfy,

09:56.330 --> 09:58.024
'cause it's all going back.

09:59.271 --> 10:02.121
You know, that kind of attitude
is why I moved out!

10:02.819 --> 10:05.809
<i>So while Axl was enjoying</i>
<i>his uncle's stolen furniture,</i>

10:05.944 --> 10:08.120
<i>Mike was busy trying to return it.</i>

10:08.296 --> 10:09.597
What is this?

10:09.981 --> 10:11.661
How are you gonna
take the furniture back

10:11.749 --> 10:12.900
in that clown car?

10:13.023 --> 10:14.886
I think if you stack it right...

10:15.006 --> 10:15.940
Damn it, Rusty!

10:16.063 --> 10:18.099
You can't keep doing this!
Enough!

10:18.265 --> 10:19.537
You're driving me crazy!

10:19.642 --> 10:22.307
You're irresponsible, unreliable.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.717
You're possibly a felon!

10:23.836 --> 10:26.363
Hey, hey, hey. I think
you're being unreasonable.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.476
I spent the whole morning
rounding this car up,

10:28.636 --> 10:30.176
putting $2 of gas in it,

10:30.338 --> 10:32.293
which I'm not even
gonna charge you for.

10:33.246 --> 10:35.099
A "thank you" might be nice.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.355
Okay, Sue, time to
shut down the cookie factory

10:40.470 --> 10:42.458
I gotta rummage through
the fridge for dinner.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.535
That's okay.
We already have dinner plans.

10:44.649 --> 10:45.958
Yeah, we're going over to Axl's.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.908
Should never go over to
somebody's house empty-handed.

10:50.477 --> 10:51.781
I'm done.

10:52.091 --> 10:53.371
- What do you mean?
- I'm done.

10:53.501 --> 10:54.981
I'm done with my brother.
It's over.

10:55.076 --> 10:56.556
I told him not to come for Christmas.

10:57.011 --> 10:57.781
You did?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.182
If he were a friend, I'd have
been done with him years ago!

11:00.325 --> 11:01.845
I get nothing out of it but headaches!

11:01.947 --> 11:04.147
And I don't want to hear
"you do for family," Frankie.

11:04.148 --> 11:05.459
I did enough for him.
I'm done.

11:07.114 --> 11:08.434
Okay, then.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.127
Okay.

11:19.995 --> 11:20.897
No.

11:21.008 --> 11:22.888
I forgot about cookies
for Christmas dinner!

11:23.020 --> 11:24.100
How many people are coming?

11:24.219 --> 11:25.619
Are grandpa and Uncle Rusty coming?

11:25.620 --> 11:28.335
- Whoever's comin' is comin'.
- Whoever isn't, isn't.

11:30.328 --> 11:32.526
Well, I'm not
wise man number two anymore.

11:32.717 --> 11:34.290
Brick.

11:34.408 --> 11:36.759
I'm wise man number two
<i>and</i> number three.

11:36.884 --> 11:39.306
Turns out wise man three
has a bit of a shoving problem.

11:39.443 --> 11:41.074
So my new line is,

11:41.203 --> 11:43.771
"I bring you frankincense,
and he brings you myrrh."

11:43.891 --> 11:45.867
Brick, that's great!

11:46.039 --> 11:47.645
Two parts.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.823
They must think you're
doing a really great job.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.870
<i>And</i> you get to say "myrrh"
like you wanted.

11:51.996 --> 11:54.180
When you got it, you got it.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.447
What do you got there?

11:56.063 --> 11:58.483
It's the invitation
to Axl's Christmas party.

11:59.696 --> 12:01.262
Didn't you get one?

12:03.326 --> 12:04.723
Awkward.

12:07.441 --> 12:08.727
Hey.

12:09.616 --> 12:12.208
Where the hell's my Christmas tree?

12:18.202 --> 12:20.122
<i>Well, Axl was certainly</i>
<i>prepared for Christmas,</i>

12:20.297 --> 12:22.722
<i>and with ten days</i>
<i>until my discount kicked in,</i>

12:22.866 --> 12:24.757
<i>I was preparing in my own way.</i>

12:29.990 --> 12:32.956
- Hey.
- Hey!

12:40.777 --> 12:43.591
I swear you would not believe
the lengths customers go to

12:43.699 --> 12:46.779
to hide stuff so they can buy it
later when the sales kick in.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.606
No. I can believe it.

12:54.277 --> 12:56.295
Okay, now what
are we gonna do tomorrow?

12:56.435 --> 12:59.265
Rock it for Jesus!

12:59.387 --> 13:00.844
Okay.

13:04.154 --> 13:05.803
Brick, it's been a long day.
Let's go.

13:05.933 --> 13:07.036
Okay, one second.

13:07.142 --> 13:08.889
I need to get fitted for my crown.

13:09.010 --> 13:10.335
Brick.

13:14.136 --> 13:15.307
Bye!

13:19.178 --> 13:20.815
Holidays can be a stressful time.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.010
So I hear.

13:22.126 --> 13:23.761
You know, Mike, I get the sense

13:23.762 --> 13:25.322
that something's weighing on your mind.

13:25.484 --> 13:27.493
You know, I'm a pretty good listener.

13:27.606 --> 13:28.818
No. I'm good.

13:28.938 --> 13:32.209
Dealing with family can be tough.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.774
Yeah? I hadn't
really thought about it.

13:34.885 --> 13:36.685
But you know, you don't
have to do it alone.

13:37.314 --> 13:38.390
Alone's fine.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.170
I'm talking 'bout kickin' it upstairs

13:40.279 --> 13:41.965
to a different department.

13:58.836 --> 14:01.039
All lines open 24/7.

14:02.953 --> 14:04.357
Okay. Yeah.

14:04.502 --> 14:06.602
Thanks, but the Colts are rebuilding,

14:06.621 --> 14:08.381
and I don't want to
distract him from that.

14:08.532 --> 14:10.847
You know,
he's a pretty good multitasker.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.965
I bet he could handle
you and the Colts.

14:13.087 --> 14:15.152
Just something to think about, Mike.

14:15.276 --> 14:17.023
Will do. Brick!

14:19.165 --> 14:20.838
I'm just gonna go get him.

14:21.373 --> 14:22.373
Sure.

14:23.745 --> 14:25.652
<i>So the end of my 20th day</i>
<i>had finally come,</i>

14:25.768 --> 14:27.387
<i>and my discount was kicking in.</i>

14:27.515 --> 14:29.382
<i>All I had to do was make it to closing</i>

14:29.511 --> 14:32.225
<i>cash out, and hightail it</i>
<i>to Brick's play.</i>

14:32.426 --> 14:34.675
Look at this.
Found another stash.

14:34.858 --> 14:36.098
And I don't even wanna tell you

14:36.099 --> 14:38.179
what I just pulled out of
a mannequin's underpants.

14:39.256 --> 14:40.926
Legally, I can't resell it.

14:41.066 --> 14:44.355
You know what? Let me put
that stuff back for you, Penny.

14:44.464 --> 14:45.962
You've been working so hard all week.

14:46.092 --> 14:48.419
Thanks, Frankie.

14:48.535 --> 14:49.987
You're a real go-getter.

14:50.094 --> 14:51.854
Well, I wasn't fishing
for that compliment,

14:51.939 --> 14:53.156
but I'll reel it in.

14:53.264 --> 14:54.556
Reel...

15:01.804 --> 15:03.572
Sweet.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.832
Come on!

15:27.303 --> 15:28.726
Eye. Eye. Beard.

15:28.860 --> 15:30.388
Eye. Eye. Beard.

15:30.517 --> 15:32.087
Eye. Eye. Cramp!

15:32.267 --> 15:34.737
God! Hand cramp!

15:34.855 --> 15:36.752
No! Not now! Not now!

15:36.878 --> 15:38.139
Come on, Sue, hurry it up.

15:38.257 --> 15:40.057
We're gonna be late
for your brother's play.

15:40.058 --> 15:42.725
No!

15:42.857 --> 15:44.456
I've been robbed!

15:44.581 --> 15:46.024
What happened to all my cool stuff?

15:46.133 --> 15:47.239
It wasn't your stuff.

15:47.356 --> 15:49.409
I got a couple guys
and a truck from the quarry,

15:49.500 --> 15:50.420
and I took it all back.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.322
So where am I supposed to live now?

15:52.475 --> 15:54.755
- How about in your room?
- I can't go back to that dump

15:54.844 --> 15:56.582
after living in the garage.
Are you crazy?

15:56.733 --> 15:58.736
I need my sick crib!

15:58.915 --> 16:00.248
Pfft.

16:25.104 --> 16:27.893
So, my brother...

16:29.673 --> 16:32.653
I mean... well, you saw.
You're probably up to speed.

16:32.774 --> 16:35.737
I'm just wondering
if I did the right thing.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.025
I-I don't know if you
show me, or...

16:41.483 --> 16:42.981
if that's even the way it works.

16:43.134 --> 16:44.454
Frankie's more the church person.

16:44.483 --> 16:47.001
If you told <i>her</i> and she told me,

16:47.122 --> 16:48.401
that'd be fine.

16:55.036 --> 16:57.615
Anyway, thanks for Andrew Luck.

16:59.877 --> 17:02.102
Cookies!
Get your Santa cookies.

17:02.330 --> 17:03.802
Once they're gone, they're gone.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.070
If everyone could please grab a seat,

17:09.182 --> 17:11.968
"JC's Rockin' Birthday Jam"
is about to begin.

17:12.089 --> 17:13.569
The kids have been working real hard.

17:13.636 --> 17:17.493
So sit back, enjoy the show.
Thanks for coming down.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.127
Where were you?
Why are you so late?

17:21.128 --> 17:22.114
I was hiding presents

17:22.232 --> 17:23.252
on this really high shelf

17:23.359 --> 17:25.228
so nobody would
buy them out from under me.

17:25.386 --> 17:27.095
- Smart.
- I know, right?

17:27.231 --> 17:28.871
Until somebody wheeled my ladder away

17:28.988 --> 17:30.231
and I got stuck up there.

17:30.348 --> 17:32.188
By the time I got down,
the store was closed,

17:32.189 --> 17:33.029
the manager was gone,

17:33.110 --> 17:34.645
and I had to roll under the gate.

17:35.075 --> 17:36.338
So you didn't get any presents?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.445
No. Zip. Zero presents.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.643
But tomorrow's Christmas.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.373
Really, Mike?
I did not know that.

17:48.490 --> 17:50.198
<i>So it was Christmas Eve,</i>

17:50.315 --> 17:52.149
<i>and none of us were in the spirit.</i>

17:52.269 --> 17:54.756
<i>And Brick's performance</i>
<i>wasn't making it any better.</i>

17:57.830 --> 17:59.572
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

18:03.328 --> 18:05.914
There it is, the star in the east.

18:06.059 --> 18:07.739
It will lead us to the new king.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.829
So we shall take our son to Egypt

18:16.956 --> 18:19.760
and save him from Herod's wrath.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.852
You didn't do that right.

18:21.980 --> 18:24.306
It's kind of a big moment,
and you didn't sell it.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.879
Now he's a director.

18:27.155 --> 18:28.247
I bring you gold.

18:30.416 --> 18:31.493
Brick!

18:31.616 --> 18:33.125
I bring you gold.

18:36.301 --> 18:37.222
I bring you gold,

18:37.368 --> 18:40.827
he brings you frankincense,
and he brings you myrrh!

18:44.096 --> 18:45.588
What's he doing now?

18:45.716 --> 18:46.764
He's looking up.

18:49.104 --> 18:50.584
He's twirling his crown.

18:50.716 --> 18:52.636
He's eating a cookie.

18:52.755 --> 18:53.672
One of mine?

18:53.769 --> 18:55.330
<i>Well, sometimes people surprise you,</i>

18:55.455 --> 18:57.044
<i>and sometimes they don't.</i>

18:57.213 --> 19:01.040
<i>Sometimes, they act exactly</i>
<i>the way you expect them to.</i>

19:06.116 --> 19:08.343
I guess we won't be moving
to Hollywood anytime soon.

19:08.472 --> 19:10.347
No, I don't think so.

19:13.733 --> 19:17.968
These are the actual cookies
eaten by a wise man on stage.

19:18.095 --> 19:19.270
Hey, Sue Heck.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.338
Terrific job on the concession stand.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.434
No. I failed.
But it's okay.

19:24.552 --> 19:26.320
You know, you can tell me.
I can take it.

19:26.437 --> 19:28.670
Well, probably not,
so I would go easy on me.

19:28.789 --> 19:30.751
You don't fail when you do your best.

19:30.876 --> 19:32.611
Anyway, I'm headed up to Bloomington.

19:32.763 --> 19:35.832
They have this big interfaith
snowball fight on campus

19:35.954 --> 19:38.240
where they work out
thousands of years of conflict

19:38.361 --> 19:39.981
in a fun, safe environment.

19:40.140 --> 19:43.263
Would it be cool if I took
some of your delicious cookies?

19:43.646 --> 19:45.516
Yes.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.183
I just wish there was more of 'em.

19:47.356 --> 19:50.473
Well, I have
a thousand more in the car.

19:50.612 --> 19:53.071
I mean that. A thousand.

19:55.925 --> 19:58.552
Brick! Hey.

19:59.301 --> 20:00.470
So what happened?

20:00.585 --> 20:02.571
You seemed a little
distracted up there.

20:02.690 --> 20:03.575
Really?

20:03.729 --> 20:04.836
- Yeah.

20:04.972 --> 20:07.372
For the whole second half,
you faced the back of the stage.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.292
Well,
I gave it a whack.

20:09.538 --> 20:10.511
Whack.

20:10.706 --> 20:11.694
Whoop.

20:11.851 --> 20:13.959
Dude, that was awesome.

20:14.102 --> 20:15.678
This thing was
a total suck-fest

20:15.774 --> 20:16.974
till you showed up, seriously.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.572
You rocked it. That
shoe-squeaking was hilarious.

20:19.695 --> 20:21.553
Thanks.
I saw it on a TV show

20:21.682 --> 20:24.084
where guys in shiny shorts
ran up and down a floor,

20:24.230 --> 20:26.824
and I really liked the squeaking sound.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.940
Brick, that was
a basketball game.

20:29.065 --> 20:30.771
Yeah, it was. Up top.

20:30.906 --> 20:33.382
Come on.
One more. Is that all you got?

20:33.528 --> 20:35.215
Whoop. Nope. Not this time.

20:35.393 --> 20:38.287
No... It's okay, one more.
No! Sorry.

20:38.423 --> 20:40.855
<i>And at that moment, Mike realized...</i>

20:41.026 --> 20:43.185
<i>Brick was Axl's weird brother.</i>

20:43.424 --> 20:46.497
<i>And it'd kill him if he ever</i>
<i>thought there would come a day</i>

20:46.605 --> 20:49.395
<i>when they would stop</i>
<i>speaking to each other.</i>

20:50.797 --> 20:53.570
I'm telling you, man,
it's a golden opportunity.

20:53.689 --> 20:54.892
I don't know, Rusty.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.387
Come on, Mike, how many llamas
can I put you down for?

21:02.127 --> 21:03.047
- What is this?
- Mom?

21:03.079 --> 21:03.897
Is this a joke?

21:04.003 --> 21:06.412
Okay, those are from
the JJ Macky Christmas mailer,

21:06.537 --> 21:08.818
and they represent presents to come.

21:08.953 --> 21:11.442
A Camaro? Awesome!

21:11.589 --> 21:13.159
Turn it around.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.128
A shirt?

21:17.142 --> 21:18.867
<i>So Mike and Rusty made up.</i>

21:19.000 --> 21:20.141
<i>It wasn't that hard,</i>

21:20.248 --> 21:22.856
<i>'cause Rusty hadn't realized</i>
<i>they were even in a fight.</i>

21:23.008 --> 21:25.732
<i>And I made up for Christmas day</i>
<i>the day after Christmas,</i>

21:25.875 --> 21:29.460
<i>with 50% off plus my employee discount.</i>

21:29.996 --> 21:32.208
<i>Yep, the Heck family cleaned up.</i>

21:32.557 --> 21:34.930
<i>I think we may have</i>
<i>a new family tradition.</i>
