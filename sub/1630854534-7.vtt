16:40.240 --> 16:43.440
That's so awesome, Ashy.
I didn't know, your dad was coming.

That is funny.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.240
You're not... He's not your...

16:49.280 --> 16:51.760
No, mate, I'm not her dad.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.080
Obviously.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.600
Ah, he's actually my boyfriend,
so...

16:56.640 --> 16:58.360
OK. Alright.
I'm sorry, Gavin.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.000
No, it's Gordon, actually.
You can probably head off, mate.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.560
No, it's Gordon, actually.
You can probably head off, mate.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.560
This is my place.
Don't kick him out.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.440
You're being weird. Don't be weird.
I'm being weird?

17:04.480 --> 17:05.480
Yeah.
You're being weird.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.720

Oh.

No, mate, I can't fuckin'
grab you anything, alright?

17:11.640 --> 17:13.560

..but usually
she's sort of brilliant.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.120
I mean, she's usually...

19:58.200 --> 19:59.720
I've never met anyone like her,
you know?

19:59.760 --> 20:00.000

I over-trusted a fart during that.
