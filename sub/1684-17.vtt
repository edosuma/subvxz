00:00.960 --> 00:02.671
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.754 --> 00:05.382
Two hundred years in purgatory
have dearly sapped my skills.

00:05.465 --> 00:07.258
My powers are peaking.

00:08.510 --> 00:09.844
Give in to the darkness.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.681
Find your true self.

00:14.224 --> 00:16.142
I know you
still mourn our son.

00:16.226 --> 00:18.478
I just hope his actions
have brought him some peace.

00:18.603 --> 00:19.813
Henry...

00:20.105 --> 00:21.106
You're still alive.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.983
I killed Moloch
for you, Mother.

00:24.442 --> 00:25.485
For our kind.

00:25.568 --> 00:27.612
It's time for us
to begin our work.

00:27.696 --> 00:29.614
My soul is tarnished.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.700
<i>My family needs protection.</i>

00:31.783 --> 00:33.368
You've gone to
the dark side, haven't you?

00:33.451 --> 00:34.452
<i>That other Frank,</i>

00:34.577 --> 00:37.997
is about to take over
and replace me forever.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.375
This place holds
all the answers

00:40.458 --> 00:42.877
to every question
we have about our
role as Witnesses.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.087
This is the path
that we have to take.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.171
The choice is clear.

00:45.255 --> 00:46.214
Destroy the Fenestella.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.466
We just blew up the author
of the Declaration
of Independence.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.468
Truth be told, he insisted.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.223
"The Time Traveler
was one of those men

00:55.306 --> 00:57.892
"who are too
clever to be believed.

00:57.976 --> 01:00.228
"You never felt that you
saw all around him,

01:00.562 --> 01:03.606
"you always suspected
some subtle reserve,

01:03.857 --> 01:07.986
"some ingenuity in ambush,
behind his lucid frankness."

01:08.153 --> 01:10.113
That sounds like
someone I know.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.614
I shall take that
as a compliment.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.910
I had no idea that
a man out of time

01:16.035 --> 01:18.455
was itself such
a time-worn literary trope.

01:18.830 --> 01:23.626
Oh, sure. <i>Doctor Who,</i>
<i>Connecticut Yankee,</i>
Marty McFly.

01:24.669 --> 01:25.670
List goes on.

01:25.754 --> 01:27.547
Here I thought I
was rather unique.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.508
Don't worry,
you're the only one
in the nonfiction section.

01:32.051 --> 01:34.179
A cornucopia of knowledge.

01:35.054 --> 01:38.016
Each book key to a different
corner of our soul.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.144
And yet, so few customers.

01:41.603 --> 01:42.771
Preaching to the choir.

01:43.772 --> 01:46.107
Ever since everyone
started downloading
books from the cloud,

01:46.191 --> 01:48.693
I've had to take
in research gigs
just to keep the doors open.

01:49.194 --> 01:50.987
For which we are thankful.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.655
Mmm.

01:52.739 --> 01:53.782
Perfect.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.617
Any luck with
the titles we asked for?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.076
I wish I could say yes.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.288
I mean,
there's rare and obscure,
and then there's your list.

02:00.789 --> 02:02.791
<i>A Study of</i>
<i>Apocryphal Prophecy.</i>

02:02.874 --> 02:05.960
<i>Hierarchies of Demonic Evil.</i>
<i>Enoch's Bible.</i>

02:06.044 --> 02:08.713
I mean,
where exactly did you say
that you'd seen these books?

02:09.923 --> 02:11.216
Internet.
Oxford.

02:12.217 --> 02:15.887
We had access to
a private store
that has since been lost.

02:16.387 --> 02:19.682
I'll keep looking.
Let you know if
anything turns up.

02:21.226 --> 02:25.230
Destroying Thomas Jefferson's
Fenestella was the right move.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.940
Can't help but
wishing we'd got our hands

02:27.065 --> 02:28.733
on some of the books
stored in there.

02:28.817 --> 02:33.446
It seems, absent any
definitive guidelines
to our role as Witnesses,

02:33.530 --> 02:36.324
we must continue to define
the rules as we see fit.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.659
We can get more specific.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.662
Like, a Witness
always tips the bartender.

02:41.371 --> 02:43.122
We never fight
a land war in Asia.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.793
And must refrain from spoiling
the end of motion pictures.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.211
Thank you, Rosebud.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.921
Hey, forgive and forget.

02:51.464 --> 02:52.757
All kidding aside,

02:53.925 --> 02:57.512
being a cop or a soldier,
you live and die by
a code of conduct.

02:57.595 --> 03:00.181
And I believe in what we do,
but it doesn't
make it any easier

03:00.265 --> 03:02.267
keeping friends
or relationships.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.435
To be effective,
we must put our bond as

03:04.602 --> 03:06.729
Witnesses before
anyone or anything else.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.691
Truer words, Lieutenant.

03:12.110 --> 03:13.403
Truer words.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.119
So when you say you
gambled away all
of it, what is...

03:21.202 --> 03:25.248
Money market,
savings, stock accounts,
college fund, it's...

03:26.124 --> 03:27.834
I'm so sorry, it's all gone.

03:30.795 --> 03:32.046
We can
work through it.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.386
Idiot!

03:38.469 --> 03:39.679
It was an accident,
you pulled out in front of me.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.514
You better
believe you're gonna
be paying for this, pal.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.113
Michelle, are you all right?

04:18.843 --> 04:22.639
You came with him,
your lover, to my funeral?

05:00.510 --> 05:03.638
Reyes said the disturbances
were all in close proximity.

05:03.721 --> 05:06.683
Did she mention
anything else unusual?

05:06.766 --> 05:10.061
Other than a girl speaking
in her dead father's voice?
No.

05:11.646 --> 05:12.730
Hey, hey.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.024
We got a problem.
As do we.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.818
We're on our way downtown.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.361
Frank Irving has
been lying to us.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.321
He's evil.

05:20.446 --> 05:21.447
What makes you think that?

05:21.531 --> 05:22.657
He told me.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.492
He's been covering ever since
he came back from the dead.

05:24.993 --> 05:27.078
But Katrina gave his soul
a clean bill of health.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.080
He used a magic rune
to get around her test.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.833
And while it was working,
he was his old self.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.711
He told me to get
his family out of town
before he went after them.

05:34.794 --> 05:35.878
Did he say what he
wanted from them?

05:36.004 --> 05:37.046
No.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.257
Just made me swear to
protect them from him.

05:39.674 --> 05:41.592
I told Cynthia to
get Macey and get out.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.220
Evil or not, it's Frank.

05:45.138 --> 05:46.180
We don't want to
hurt him again.

05:46.264 --> 05:48.099
There may be a way
to keep the captain quiescent,

05:48.266 --> 05:50.393
buy time till we
can reclaim his soul.

05:50.476 --> 05:53.813
Yet, this solution
is rather extreme.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.315
Are you suggesting we
use the Gorgon's head?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.283
- Could work.
- Doesn't a Gorgon's stare

06:05.366 --> 06:06.492
turn people to stone?

06:06.576 --> 06:09.078
I want to help Frank,
not turn him
into a museum piece.

06:09.162 --> 06:11.748
Ever since I found one of our
ancestors in that condition,

06:11.831 --> 06:13.416
I've been searching for
a way to bring her back.

06:13.499 --> 06:16.210
We found a reference in a book
on alchemical methodology.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.171
It is the process
Pygmalion used

06:18.296 --> 06:20.214
to bring the statue
Galatea to life.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.009
The point is, it's possible.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.385
Consider it a nuclear option.

06:25.053 --> 06:26.512
It's stashed in
the Masonic cell

06:26.596 --> 06:28.598
in the container we used
for the Horseman's head.

06:28.723 --> 06:30.475
Right, 'cause everyone
just has

06:30.600 --> 06:32.310
a head-storage
jar laying around.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.228
We're on the clock.

06:34.312 --> 06:35.646
As soon as we're
done with this,

06:35.772 --> 06:37.065
we'll figure out
how to handle Irving.

06:40.860 --> 06:41.903
Thank you.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.741
The woman claims no memory
of what happened.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.284
Eyewitness said
she was choking him

06:48.409 --> 06:49.869
without even
touching his throat.

06:50.203 --> 06:51.245
Problem is,

06:51.329 --> 06:53.414
the witness had already
downed half a bottle of wine.

06:53.498 --> 06:55.083
Well,
the <i>Articles of Confederation</i>

06:55.208 --> 06:56.751
were written on
the back of a bar napkin.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.630
Now, it does seem improbable

07:00.713 --> 07:03.925
that an electrical surge would
occur at the same instant

07:04.008 --> 07:06.052
as a road rage confrontation.

07:06.719 --> 07:09.472
In our line of work,
improbable means
not an accident.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.434
You say all
the victims were local?
Hmm.

07:13.518 --> 07:14.477
Different ages?

07:14.560 --> 07:15.937
Yeah, same symptoms.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.272
Fugue state,
no recollection
of what happened.

07:18.356 --> 07:20.608
Wait, an electrical surge,

07:20.691 --> 07:23.402
a bloody handprint,
a voice from beyond the grave.

07:25.321 --> 07:26.864
These are
supernatural phenomena,

07:26.989 --> 07:28.533
and we've encountered
them before.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.451
Serilda.

07:31.994 --> 07:32.995
Andy Brooks.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.747
<i>I slayed your Mason brethren.</i>

07:35.039 --> 07:36.165
Solomon Kent.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.462
These people are
exhibiting magical powers.

07:41.546 --> 07:43.172
Yes, Lieutenant.
Witchcraft.

07:43.256 --> 07:45.174
Now, it seems they all heard
the same sound

07:45.258 --> 07:46.717
before entering
the fugue state.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.178
The tolling of a bell.

07:51.222 --> 07:52.431
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:53.057 --> 07:54.559
I think I am.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.067
We're on to something.

08:03.234 --> 08:05.069
The same bell's
been hanging here

08:05.236 --> 08:07.071
since colonial times,
and this is not it.

08:07.530 --> 08:10.032
This one looks
like the Liberty Bell,
only without the crack.

08:11.617 --> 08:12.785
You're correct.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.787
This bell was cast
from the same mold

08:14.912 --> 08:16.747
as that famous
one in Philadelphia.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.457
How can you be sure?

08:20.209 --> 08:22.795
Distinct crown,
double band along the waist,

08:23.754 --> 08:26.549
and the fact that
I cracked the original.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.427
The original?
As in, you cracked
the Liberty Bell?

08:32.180 --> 08:33.306
A little.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.971
The Liberty Bell
in Philadelphia
was damaged in 1846.

09:14.639 --> 09:16.057
How could you have
been responsible?

09:16.766 --> 09:18.851
Whilst that bell
carries the famous name,

09:18.935 --> 09:21.229
many others were cast
from the same mold.

09:21.437 --> 09:23.898
The first of
which was a target

09:23.981 --> 09:27.443
for colonial sabotage
in the year 1773.

09:30.196 --> 09:32.240
<i>I had orders</i>
<i>from General Washington</i>

09:32.323 --> 09:34.367
<i>to locate a crate</i>
<i>bearing the mark</i>

09:34.492 --> 09:36.577
<i>of the Axminster</i>
<i>Bell Company, London,</i>

09:36.994 --> 09:39.413
<i>and destroy its</i>
<i>contents utterly.</i>

09:40.706 --> 09:42.750
<i>In order to discern if</i>
<i>my target was present,</i>

09:43.960 --> 09:46.003
<i>a diversion was necessary.</i>

09:59.350 --> 10:02.144
<i>Armed with</i>
<i>a black powder charge</i>
<i>of my own making,</i>

10:02.228 --> 10:04.563
<i>I was prepared to</i>
<i>carry out my orders.</i>

10:04.855 --> 10:07.692
<i>At the moment of truth,</i>
<i>my ruse was discovered.</i>

10:10.027 --> 10:12.446
<i>But my decoy had already</i>
<i>served its purpose.</i>

10:13.197 --> 10:15.658
<i>As did my explosive charge.</i>

10:21.038 --> 10:23.207
That was your brilliant plan?
A decoy dummy?

10:24.041 --> 10:26.502
A time-tested tactic
since Hannibal of Carthage.

10:27.128 --> 10:30.798
Washington's orders,
they now make perfect sense.

10:31.507 --> 10:34.135
If these bells
cause people to display
powers of witchcraft,

10:34.218 --> 10:38.014
their use as weapons
would be undeniable.

10:38.389 --> 10:40.474
And now,
one's turned up
on our town square.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.851
Placed with intent.

10:42.226 --> 10:46.230
By whom and for what purpose
we must determine
before it is rung again.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.733
If we're dealing
with a witch problem,
we have to call Katrina.

10:50.568 --> 10:53.487
Since our encounter with
the warlock Solomon Kent,

10:54.405 --> 10:56.574
Katrina has been distant.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.368
Withdrawn.

11:23.309 --> 11:24.810
Your rest was
most fitful, Mother.

11:34.612 --> 11:35.696
Well done, Mother.

11:38.199 --> 11:39.241
Blood magic.

11:40.910 --> 11:43.954
Your dark side becomes you,
as does true power.

11:44.789 --> 11:45.790
Is this a dream?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.000
Are you truly here?

11:48.084 --> 11:50.419
I apologize for my
temerity earlier.

11:51.087 --> 11:54.799
I very much wanted to see you,
but I wasn't sure
how you'd react.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.468
You are my son, Henry.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.554
I hoped and prayed
you were still alive.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.598
In my dream,
you said that you killed

12:02.723 --> 12:04.392
Moloch in order
to save my life.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.476
I did.

12:06.268 --> 12:09.939
Instinct, pure and
primal or so I thought.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.358
Now I realize it
was something more.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.193
Destiny.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.654
Our destiny.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.034
I have so much to tell you.

12:25.079 --> 12:28.874
Bells have long
been associated
with pagan ceremonies,

12:28.958 --> 12:31.043
Druidic and Wiccan rituals.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.712
From May Day to
<i>Walpurgisnacht.</i>

12:33.796 --> 12:36.799
This particular bell
has definite connections
to witchcraft.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.760
This is
an ancient pagan symbol,

12:39.844 --> 12:43.848
and this is
the corporate emblem
of Axminster Bell Company.

12:44.265 --> 12:46.517
The very same was on
the crate I sabotaged.

12:46.684 --> 12:49.687
A symbol associated with
the "Ritual of Awakening,"

12:50.855 --> 12:54.233
a ceremony that
sparks the power
of those with witch heritage.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.446
There was once
a thriving coven in this area.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.365
Their descendants could number
into the thousands.

13:01.449 --> 13:03.868
A bell rings and 1,000 people
turn into witches?

13:05.661 --> 13:06.871
We're talking mayhem.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.247
Only three
people were affected.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.749
Clearly, this ritual did not
have the intended effect.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.126
Whatever the case,
we have to make sure

13:12.251 --> 13:13.544
that that bell
does not ring again.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.171
We crack it. Same way you did.

13:17.298 --> 13:18.591
It's a shame we
used all the C-4

13:18.716 --> 13:20.050
when we took
down the Fenestella.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.303
Fear not.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.971
With the correct ingredients,

13:24.054 --> 13:28.058
I can concoct
the exact black powder
charge I used in 1773.

13:33.189 --> 13:36.901
I hope you find my
home more appealing
than last time you visited.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.153
After a long, fallow winter,

13:39.403 --> 13:41.739
spring has come again
to Fredericks Manor.

13:44.575 --> 13:47.661
You can let your guard down.
I mean you no harm.

13:47.745 --> 13:48.746
Okay.

13:49.747 --> 13:51.373
I want to believe you, Henry.

13:52.541 --> 13:56.170
It is difficult,
after all the things
that you have done.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.547
Misguided choices
that I have come to regret.

13:58.714 --> 14:01.592
You stood by Moloch's side
as he sought to
bring the Apocalypse.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.385
His Apocalypse, not mine.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.680
I have something
to show you, Mother.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.974
A gift from Captain Irving.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.269
<i>John Dee's</i> Grand Grimoire.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.656
The enchantments
within the <i>Grimoire</i>

14:23.781 --> 14:25.533
are the most
powerful ever assembled.

14:26.951 --> 14:28.285
And most dangerous.

14:28.953 --> 14:31.997
Whoever holds it is capable
of so much destruction.

14:32.081 --> 14:35.292
I no longer seek
wanton carnage, Mother.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.586
I've found my path.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.214
To bring back our kind.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.549
Our kind?

14:43.884 --> 14:45.261
You mean the Awakening Ritual.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.930
I tried the ancient
rite this morning,
but it didn't take.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.849
A few with witches'
blood heard the call,

14:50.933 --> 14:52.476
but only for
the briefest moment.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.896
As my father is mortal,
my blood is diluted.

14:57.648 --> 15:02.403
Only a pure-blood witch
can perform this
ritual effectively.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.656
If you were to ring the bell,

15:06.323 --> 15:09.910
its peal would be heard
in every corner
of Sleepy Hollow.

15:10.661 --> 15:12.538
The transformation
would be complete.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.125
Create a witch breed?
To what end?

15:16.292 --> 15:17.418
A coven.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.628
The most powerful ever known.

15:20.170 --> 15:24.842
Thousands strong,
with you and I
as its leaders.

15:25.217 --> 15:29.221
No longer would
our kind be hunted,
marginalized, burned.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.057
A coven.

15:33.851 --> 15:35.144
With you and I at
the center of it.

15:35.311 --> 15:36.312
Mmm-hmm.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.065
What about your father?

15:42.192 --> 15:43.360
He is not one of us.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.197
In the end, he never can be.

15:51.577 --> 15:55.372
You're asking me to give up
everything I have believed in,

15:55.998 --> 15:57.291
fought for, for 200 years.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.417
Yes, I am.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.463
This is a dream I
cannot dream alone.

16:03.130 --> 16:07.009
This is why I
saved you from Moloch,
to save us both.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.638
So we could have
the family we never had.

16:13.641 --> 16:15.517
I can't do this
without you, Mother.

16:37.122 --> 16:40.459
If only we had
such a wealth of tools
whilst building a nation.

16:42.294 --> 16:45.798
What, pray tell,
are "seasonal items"?

16:45.881 --> 16:46.840
It's a thing.

16:46.924 --> 16:49.134
People decorate their lawns
for different holidays.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.429
Flashing hearts
for Valentine's,

16:52.596 --> 16:54.848
animatronic
ghosts for Halloween,

16:54.932 --> 16:57.559
and Christmas is, like,
the Super Bowl of lawn deco.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.271
But which holiday requires
monopedal pink birds

17:01.355 --> 17:03.399
and a band
of barbate pygmies?

17:04.274 --> 17:05.776
Arbor Day.

17:06.402 --> 17:07.361
Oh.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.407
Last on the list.

17:11.490 --> 17:14.368
Now we have everything
we need to make black
powder explosives.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.786
Keep it down.
Last thing we need

17:15.911 --> 17:17.162
is to be arrested
by Homeland Security.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.623
Which begs the question,

17:19.707 --> 17:20.874
how do we blow up
the bell without

17:20.958 --> 17:22.126
taking down half
the town square?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.586
If memory serves true,

17:24.670 --> 17:26.296
there is an entrance
to the tunnels

17:26.463 --> 17:28.132
via an alleyway
off the town square.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.051
It's been bricked over,
but can be easily reopened.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.429
And since the tunnels
were built to store
the munitions...

17:33.512 --> 17:35.139
They can contain an explosion.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.558
All we need is to
drag the bell inside,

17:37.641 --> 17:39.893
place the charge,
light the fuse...

17:42.563 --> 17:43.564
My good man.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.482
Could you direct me
to the store quadrant

17:45.607 --> 17:47.151
where I might
find flint and steel?

17:47.609 --> 17:50.654
Uh...
Is that a CD, or a cologne?

17:51.071 --> 17:52.156
'Cause we don't carry either.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.492
A lighter.

17:55.868 --> 17:56.994
Modern marvel.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.412
Right by checkout.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.788
Lighters require refueling,

17:59.872 --> 18:02.416
whereas flint and steel
can always be relied upon.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.752
Now, I appreciate
the modern world.

18:05.419 --> 18:08.505
But sometimes,
old school is the best school.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.549
Oh!

18:10.632 --> 18:11.967
Batteries.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.848
Now we have an entrance.

18:18.599 --> 18:21.935
Now to end the trouble
this wicked bell represents.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.774
All that remains
is to push the bell
into the tunnels...

18:26.857 --> 18:27.941
Take cover!

18:35.365 --> 18:36.366
Irving.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.826
He's got a bolt
action single-shot.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.037
He needs time to reload.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.497
Jenny, wait.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.583
I got this.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.794
You two,
blow that bell to hell.

19:09.608 --> 19:13.737
When Henry sent me
to guard the bell,
I'd hoped you'd show.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.825
Save me the trouble
of finding you myself.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.828
My family,

19:21.537 --> 19:22.663
where are they, Jenny?

19:23.497 --> 19:25.332
You told me this
would happen, Frank!

19:25.415 --> 19:26.917
You told me to keep
them away from you.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.045
Tell me where my family is.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.589
Or next time,
I shoot to kill.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.874
A few hundred feet
should be far enough.

20:11.753 --> 20:12.754
Crane...

20:16.675 --> 20:17.718
Henry.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.806
You must have so
many questions.

20:24.308 --> 20:25.475
Let Katrina go.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.686
Let's keep this between us.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.646
You want to tell him,
Mother, or should I?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.320
You came of
your own free will.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.239
I did not expect
you to understand.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.408
No. No, Katrina...

20:41.867 --> 20:45.120
Whatever Henry has told you,
you cannot trust
a word he says.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.788
I trust what I feel.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.167
He has done nothing
but try to destroy us.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.877
He saved me from Moloch.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.087
He saved all of us.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.089
Now he's trying to turn
people into witches.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.133
The bell is a gift.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.929
I am awakening
what is already
within their blood.

21:02.054 --> 21:03.513
What about the rest
of Sleepy Hollow?

21:04.598 --> 21:05.974
Innocent bystanders.

21:06.183 --> 21:09.436
We are the innocent
that have been wronged.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.188
This town should be ours!

21:11.271 --> 21:13.357
What we were owed, promised.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.025
"Promised"?

21:15.984 --> 21:16.944
By whom?

21:17.027 --> 21:18.820
General Washington made
a pact with our coven.

21:18.904 --> 21:21.281
If we helped win the war,

21:21.365 --> 21:24.159
witches would finally
reintegrate into society.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.870
A promise he reneged on.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.873
And one that must be
reconciled at any cost.

21:31.083 --> 21:35.128
I understand why
you are drawn in
by what he is offering.

21:35.212 --> 21:38.340
But it is bait
that hides a hook.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.175
You are wrong.

21:40.717 --> 21:41.885
He has changed.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.179
No, no, Kat...
No, that's guilt.

21:44.972 --> 21:47.724
Guilt at what you
perceive to be your
failings as a mother.

21:47.808 --> 21:51.561
No! It was always meant
to be the two of us.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.106
I've always needed her.

21:56.692 --> 21:59.111
I am sorry it
took me so long
to see the truth.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.155
The idea that
a mortal man and I

22:02.280 --> 22:03.782
could truly make
a life together...

22:03.865 --> 22:06.076
You be wary.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.538
What you're saying
now cannot be unsaid.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.331
In a way,

22:12.249 --> 22:15.168
it is a relief to
finally be able to speak it.

22:16.712 --> 22:19.172
I do not belong
here in this time.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.174
Among humankind.

22:22.801 --> 22:23.885
Beside you.

22:24.845 --> 22:28.682
If this truly
is your choice...

22:31.143 --> 22:32.144
So be it.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.770
But the bell?

22:34.688 --> 22:35.939
You shall not have the bell.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.357
The bell is ours.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.111
And the Awakening Ritual
will occur tonight.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.865
When the Perigean
tide is the highest,
my powers shall peak.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.616
And you shall not interfere.

23:07.929 --> 23:11.558
What's their next move?
How long before
they ring that bell?

23:11.641 --> 23:14.394
Katrina will wait until
the Perigean tide
is at its highest

23:14.478 --> 23:16.229
before she
performs the ritual.

23:16.313 --> 23:17.481
So, a matter of hours?

23:17.939 --> 23:18.940
Hmm.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.819
Is it possible that
Henry could've cast
some kind of spell on her?

23:23.612 --> 23:26.573
There is no need to soften
the blow, Lieutenant.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.909
Katrina has chosen to
side with the enemy.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.745
When we made those
rules this morning,

23:31.828 --> 23:34.164
I had no idea they would
be so sorely tested.

23:34.915 --> 23:36.500
Yeah, you're telling me?

23:37.042 --> 23:38.877
Jenny's out there
facing Irving alone.

23:39.503 --> 23:41.254
And we are in here!

23:41.963 --> 23:43.840
We must stay
focused on our duty.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.176
Henry.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.136
Henry is the source
of all our ills.

23:48.220 --> 23:51.723
We take out
the heart of this evil,
the limbs will surely follow.

23:54.643 --> 23:56.061
I will not hesitate.

23:57.354 --> 23:58.605
Not again.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.192
One thing's for sure.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.861
I'm glad I'm
not in this alone.

24:06.530 --> 24:08.865
I echo that sentiment,
Lieutenant.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.202
The witch bell.
You cracked it once.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.746
Let's do it again.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.541
They would take
it somewhere safe.
Fredericks Manor, maybe?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.042
No, no. We'd expect that.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.962
There is another
possible location.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.381
The bell I intercepted
in 1773

24:24.464 --> 24:26.383
was en route to
Sleepy Hollow Town Hall.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.177
That town hall's been
boarded up for years now.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.013
We arm ourselves to the teeth.

24:32.556 --> 24:33.890
Stage a full-frontal assault.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.517
A distraction?

24:35.767 --> 24:38.603
Long enough to
find the bell.
Destroy it.

24:46.111 --> 24:48.113
This is where my old
coven used to meet.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.656
Long before you were born.

24:49.739 --> 24:53.410
Then it is fitting.
This is where
the bell should ring.

24:56.830 --> 25:00.167
Our new coven rise
from the ashes of the old.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.837
Mother?

25:05.255 --> 25:06.590
You were having
second thoughts?

25:07.215 --> 25:09.843
Oh, no. Quite the opposite.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.512
When I fought
the warlock Solomon Kent,

25:12.596 --> 25:16.183
he told me
I had neglected
the truth about myself.

25:17.767 --> 25:18.768
But he was wrong.

25:19.436 --> 25:23.106
It's not about
dark magic or power.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.067
It is about you.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.322
I never should've left you
the way I did, Henry.

25:30.614 --> 25:31.948
All those years ago.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.244
We're together now.

25:37.829 --> 25:41.625
We shall create what
we both desire most.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.169
My darling boy.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.048
Do you realize
what you have done?

25:49.633 --> 25:51.509
You have given
me back my soul.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.643
Henry Parish!

26:08.568 --> 26:10.028
Henry!

26:15.158 --> 26:17.160
You have to
admire his tenacity.

26:19.663 --> 26:22.249
You prepare the ritual.
I'll take care of this.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.595
I know you're near, Jenny!

26:37.973 --> 26:39.683
You can't run forever.

26:41.977 --> 26:43.103
But I can.

26:54.698 --> 26:57.826
I recall there
were two Witnesses
in the Book of Revelation.

27:10.714 --> 27:12.215
We've been here before.

27:12.966 --> 27:15.719
You bare your teeth,
then you back down!

27:17.262 --> 27:21.224
You don't have what it
takes to do violence
to your only son.

27:34.321 --> 27:35.697
You've not learned a thing

27:36.573 --> 27:39.659
since Moloch dragged you
from your fetid box.

27:39.868 --> 27:44.706
Moloch was self-righteous
and self-serving.

27:44.831 --> 27:45.915
Like you!

27:46.833 --> 27:48.668
He abandoned me
just as you did.

27:48.752 --> 27:51.713
I did not abandon you, Henry.

27:53.131 --> 27:55.467
I did not even
know you existed.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.595
You're as much
a man out of time as I.

27:58.803 --> 28:04.434
Yet you cling to
the past so tightly
like an angry, unruly child.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.406
Lieutenant!

28:25.038 --> 28:26.081
Thank you, Mother.

28:36.466 --> 28:39.469
How many Witnesses did I say
were specified in the Bible?

28:41.763 --> 28:43.390
You may be one
short of a pair.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.603
This is how
a mother nurtures her son.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.857
Murder in cold blood.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.484
You and Abbie
chose this fight.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.404
You know our cause is noble.

28:57.487 --> 28:59.489
How can you
disregard all that
you were?

29:01.449 --> 29:02.992
All that we have been?

29:05.662 --> 29:06.830
It is already done.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.500
I pulled you from purgatory,
Katrina.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.627
This path...

29:14.045 --> 29:15.672
This path will send you back.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.515
The bell.

29:25.598 --> 29:26.891
The bell!

29:31.146 --> 29:32.272
Last chance.

29:40.530 --> 29:42.782
A valiant attempt,
clever even, Ms. Mills.

29:46.369 --> 29:49.205
But sadly, all for naught.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.314
Nowhere left to run, Jenny.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.149
I'm not gonna let
you hurt them, Frank!

30:16.232 --> 30:17.233
They're my family.

30:18.401 --> 30:19.694
You, Abbie and Crane.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.906
All the time I have known you,

30:24.782 --> 30:26.242
you have used me.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.707
You didn't even come
visit me in Tarrytown.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.085
You didn't even
bring by my daughter.

30:37.545 --> 30:41.549
So stop pretending
you care about my family.

30:42.759 --> 30:45.762
And tell me what I
want to know, Jenny.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.098
Or I will tear you apart!

30:49.349 --> 30:50.808
They're afraid of you, Frank!

30:51.935 --> 30:53.520
They don't want
to be with you!

30:53.603 --> 30:54.687
They will.

30:55.146 --> 30:59.275
When the bell tolls,
they'll know
what's in their blood.

31:12.914 --> 31:16.167
How does it feel to
be tied to a stake
awaiting the flames?

31:17.460 --> 31:19.087
Go to hell.

31:20.964 --> 31:22.632
It's your turn, I'm afraid.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.343
You will be
the first to burn.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.054
Are you ready
to begin, Mother?

31:28.179 --> 31:29.222
We are ready.

31:30.014 --> 31:31.683
Join your power with mine.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.437
Why stop at Sleepy Hollow
when we can have so much more?

31:40.066 --> 31:41.651
The decoy plan was a bust.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.028
So much for the old ways.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.155
Not entirely.

31:46.781 --> 31:49.659
The bomb on the bell,
they haven't spotted it yet.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.161
Doesn't change the fact that
we're tied up and weaponless.

31:52.537 --> 31:53.705
Tied, yes.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.665
Hardly weaponless.

31:56.499 --> 31:58.710
I have two flintlock
pistols beneath my coat

31:58.835 --> 32:01.045
loaded with
Greek fire charges.

32:01.588 --> 32:02.922
You been holding out on me?

32:03.006 --> 32:05.008
I did say
"armed to the teeth."

32:05.675 --> 32:08.052
A direct hit to
the black powder
would ignite it.

32:08.261 --> 32:09.971
Oh, for a shard of glass.

32:10.513 --> 32:11.764
Or sharp rock.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.976
How about flint and steel?

32:16.686 --> 32:17.729
Side pocket.

32:43.921 --> 32:45.340
I can feel them, Mother.

32:46.341 --> 32:47.884
Our coven is awakening.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.265
Henry can stop a bullet.

32:54.724 --> 32:57.685
If he catches on,
we'll never hit the target.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.979
Unless we split
his concentration.

33:01.189 --> 33:03.024
Make him a target, too.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.611
He's the Horseman of War,
he's immortal.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.780
No. I do not believe he is.

33:09.322 --> 33:11.115
His face, he bleeds.

33:11.199 --> 33:13.117
If he bleeds,
he may be mortal.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.036
Are you ready for that?

33:15.745 --> 33:18.081
Duty above all else,
Lieutenant.

33:25.254 --> 33:28.007
I'll take the warlock.
You take the bell.

33:29.759 --> 33:32.929
In three, two, and now.

33:33.429 --> 33:34.764
No!

33:56.119 --> 33:57.286
It's too late for that.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.330
Save the bell.

34:00.331 --> 34:01.582
Finish our work.

34:01.666 --> 34:03.960
The coven means nothing
without you, Henry.

34:04.544 --> 34:05.920
Not Henry.

34:07.130 --> 34:08.464
The name you chose...

34:09.132 --> 34:10.383
Was Jeremy.

34:10.466 --> 34:11.634
Jeremy.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.150
My family.

34:28.526 --> 34:30.403
I'm sorry it had
to end like this.

34:31.028 --> 34:32.363
I have no regret.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.325
"He was a man.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.830
"Take him for all and all."

34:42.457 --> 34:44.876
"I shall not see
his like again."

34:46.753 --> 34:48.004
Father?

35:35.510 --> 35:37.094
How did I get down here?

35:37.720 --> 35:38.930
Nice try, Frank.

35:39.931 --> 35:41.098
Jenny.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.811
What did I do?
How did I get here?

35:50.149 --> 35:51.484
Cynthia.

35:53.736 --> 35:54.737
Macey?

35:57.448 --> 35:58.741
Tell me they're okay.

36:01.410 --> 36:02.703
It's me.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.122
Frank.

36:06.082 --> 36:07.291
How do I know that?

36:10.586 --> 36:11.963
You don't.

36:17.635 --> 36:18.719
Frank?

36:27.895 --> 36:29.856
You better not be lying to me.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.239
Katrina?

36:39.615 --> 36:41.826
You know how much
we both cared for him.

36:43.411 --> 36:45.705
We tried everything
we could to save him.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.001
This is not your fault.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.629
No. It's yours.

37:00.094 --> 37:04.682
You are the source
of my sorrow, Ichabod Crane.

37:08.019 --> 37:11.731
You are the reason
I was not there
to raise my son.

37:12.315 --> 37:14.108
I never should
have saved your life

37:14.233 --> 37:15.985
when the Horseman
cut you down.

37:16.611 --> 37:20.489
I never should
have put you to sleep.
I should've let you die!

37:22.116 --> 37:24.911
And this time, I will.

37:45.806 --> 37:46.933
Katrina!

37:49.393 --> 37:50.686
Lieutenant!

38:21.008 --> 38:22.218
Katrina!

38:31.143 --> 38:32.395
Come on.

40:02.151 --> 40:04.403
The Traveler Spell, it worked.

40:09.700 --> 40:10.993
Jeremy.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.121
I will never
leave you ever again.

40:45.861 --> 40:47.113
Ho!

40:47.196 --> 40:49.198
You, stop there.

40:51.826 --> 40:53.035
Stop!

40:54.286 --> 40:55.454
Do you have papers?

40:58.290 --> 40:59.542
Papers?

41:03.504 --> 41:05.631
I must have left
them in my sock drawer.
You know how that is.

41:05.714 --> 41:06.966
Did we say you could speak?

41:08.008 --> 41:09.635
Excuse me.
Silence.

41:10.052 --> 41:11.345
Or you'll rue this day.

41:12.721 --> 41:15.182
If you think what I think
that you're thinking...

41:23.732 --> 41:25.943
This is wrong on
so many levels.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.611
Clearly, she's touched.

41:27.695 --> 41:29.738
Put her in shackles
so she causes no harm.

41:34.994 --> 41:38.247
No! My things.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.749
You cannot just
take them from me.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.043
I told you I can use
them to identify myself.

41:43.127 --> 41:44.879
You'll speak to a judge,
fugitive.

41:44.962 --> 41:46.297
Wait, wait, wait...

41:46.380 --> 41:49.175
I have information
that can change
the course of this war.

41:49.258 --> 41:50.759
Do you now?
That's right.

41:50.843 --> 41:52.469
And what might
this information be?

41:56.265 --> 41:57.600
There's only one
person I'll talk to...

41:59.435 --> 42:01.187
Captain Ichabod Crane.
