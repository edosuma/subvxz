just glorified beauty pageants.

-And superficial and demeaning.

13:43.792 --> 13:48.000

Stella's talent is multi-texting.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.083

-I hope she came up with a good talent.

Coming up next, our final question.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.542
But first a word from our sponsor.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.250
All right, ladies.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.834
You have been messing with me all night.

15:01.917 --> 15:04.792
But you know what? That's OK,
because it means you're scared of me.

15:04.875 --> 15:08.083
-Oh?
-Now it's time for the final question

15:08.166 --> 15:10.208
and the winner is going to be
someone with a brain.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.000
So, maybe if you all
put your heads together,

15:13.083 --> 15:14.458
you can come up with one.

Can you believe how good
Stella's been doing?

15:23.625 --> 15:25.583
All she has left now
is the final question.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.542
And we know she's gonna ace that.

15:27.625 --> 15:31.417
Congratulations to our contestants
for getting this far.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.625
And now, it's time for our final question.

15:34.709 --> 15:38.208
So much of their score depends on how
the ladies answer their final question,

15:38.291 --> 15:41.542
that it renders everything that has
happened in the show up to this point

15:41.625 --> 15:43.375
completely meaningless.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.166
Backstage we played rock-paper-scissors

15:46.250 --> 15:50.500
to determine who would flip a coin
to discover which two contestants

15:50.583 --> 15:54.875
would thumb wrestle to be the first
to answer the final question.

15:54.959 --> 15:57.208
Then we realized that was ridiculous

15:57.291 --> 16:00.625
and decided to just pick a name
out of this glass bowl.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.709
[drum roll]

16:04.792 --> 16:06.834

16:10.583 --> 16:14.959
All right. Stella Malone,
this is your final question.

16:15.041 --> 16:18.500
"In your opinion,
what is the most pressing problem

16:18.583 --> 16:20.250
facing our country today?"

16:35.083 --> 16:37.417
Uh...
[giggles]

16:37.500 --> 16:42.417
Uh... I personally believe that, uh...

16:42.500 --> 16:46.166
today's most pressing problem is,

16:46.250 --> 16:50.834
uh, US Americans are unable to do so

16:50.917 --> 16:54.000
because some people
out there in our nation

16:54.083 --> 16:56.250
-don't have maps.
-[crowd murmuring]

16:56.333 --> 17:03.250

Everywhere, like, such as...

17:05.542 --> 17:10.375
And should help the Australia
and the Europes.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.041

17:14.583 --> 17:17.041
OK, time for our next contestant.

the little geography major.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.709
Like I've always said,
girls who aren't pageant types

17:30.792 --> 17:33.291
shouldn't compete in pageants.
Toodles.

17:37.291 --> 17:38.959
Stella, we voted for you in our hearts.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.250
But, technically,
we had to use the ballots.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.083
So, it's only officially
that you're a loser.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.542
Thank you.

17:47.291 --> 17:50.083
Gosh, I don't know what happened.
I mean, I just completely blanked.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.041

and all I saw were--

17:52.125 --> 17:53.750
-Headlights?
-Yeah.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.917
-And I just felt like--
-A deer in them.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.542
Yeah.
You guys were right.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.041
I should've known
I don't belong here with these girls.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.333
It's like you said, the only reason

18:04.417 --> 18:06.125
these girls are so good
at these competitions

18:06.208 --> 18:07.667
is because it's all
they've got going for them.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.834
Yeah, that and all the boyfriends,

18:09.917 --> 18:13.417

and the magazine covers...

18:19.041 --> 18:23.750

and really funny,

18:24.083 --> 18:26.166
and way cooler
than any of these girls here.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.917

-It doesn't matter.

all over the internet.
