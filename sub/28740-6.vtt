WEBVTT

00:25.051 --> 00:29.014
Thanks for choosing
Adventure Car Hop. Drive safe.

00:33.602 --> 00:36.314
Carla, can you watch my cars?

00:36.439 --> 00:38.150
Go. I'll cover you.

00:44.365 --> 00:45.324
Charlie.

00:45.449 --> 00:49.121
I thought you were driving
your clients in Kennebunkport.

00:50.289 --> 00:54.085
A driver in their lives
and a passenger in my own?

00:55.253 --> 00:57.130
That's no way to spend a week, Jo.

00:59.466 --> 01:01.093
Or a life.

01:03.804 --> 01:05.640
I want to drive you...

01:07.225 --> 01:08.518
...our children...

01:08.643 --> 01:12.231
down the coast, on vacation,
across the country for the summer...

01:12.732 --> 01:15.443
Spend the holidays
at the cabin in Colorado.

01:16.027 --> 01:19.281
Every day will feel like Christmas,
waking up next to you.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.495
I see you, Jo. All of you.

01:25.788 --> 01:27.332
I see our future.

01:27.916 --> 01:31.587
I see us hitting the road right now
and never looking back.

01:35.507 --> 01:37.552
All you have to do...

01:38.720 --> 01:40.388
...is say yes.

01:54.071 --> 01:55.698
Charlie.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.327
I...

02:07.712 --> 02:09.506
Get in my car.

02:17.265 --> 02:20.018
- I thought you wanted this.
- I did.

02:20.143 --> 02:21.687
Well, what changed?

02:23.146 --> 02:25.190
I won't give you my hand
until I've seen it.

02:25.315 --> 02:26.776
You will, I told you that.

02:26.901 --> 02:29.988
You say that you want me
to be their mother,

02:30.113 --> 02:31.406
but I've never met them.

02:31.531 --> 02:35.035
You say that you're saving them,
you're giving them a home,

02:35.160 --> 02:36.412
but I've never seen it.

02:36.537 --> 02:40.083
You will see Christmasland,
the minute you say yes.

02:40.709 --> 02:43.545
You didn't up and decide
to quit driving today.

02:43.670 --> 02:47.633
You haven't been driving for months.
Not in Kennebunkport this week...

02:47.758 --> 02:48.968
I was buying you a ring.

02:49.093 --> 02:50.971
Not in Providence last week,

02:51.096 --> 02:55.142
or New York last month,
or Virginia the month before that.

02:55.851 --> 02:56.685
Don't.

02:57.312 --> 03:00.231
I was there. And you weren't.

03:02.317 --> 03:04.236
You promised me
you'd never spy on me.

03:04.361 --> 03:06.905
And you promised me
that you would never lie.

03:07.823 --> 03:09.074
So tell me the truth.

03:09.826 --> 03:12.162
What are you doing
to those poor children?

03:18.127 --> 03:20.838
I'm never going
to see Christmasland...

03:22.591 --> 03:24.509
...because then I would know.

03:25.552 --> 03:27.471
What you're doing.
Who you really are.

03:27.596 --> 03:29.182
I'm their father.

03:29.724 --> 03:32.060
I provide them
with joy people only dream about

03:32.185 --> 03:34.813
and I'm offering you the same thing
because I love you.

03:34.938 --> 03:36.440
You love this car.

03:36.565 --> 03:40.027
You drive it away and you only
ever come back to refill its tank.

03:40.152 --> 03:42.280
Or is it the other way around?

03:44.449 --> 03:45.950
Open the doors.

03:54.044 --> 03:56.213
You want to know
what changed, Charlie?

03:56.755 --> 03:57.589
You.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.259
You did.

04:54.697 --> 04:55.991
Come on!

05:05.877 --> 05:06.961
Damn it!

05:25.608 --> 05:27.152
Jolene...

06:17.752 --> 06:21.464
How would you describe your pain
since you arrived at the hospital,

06:21.589 --> 06:23.217
on a scale of one to ten?

06:23.342 --> 06:26.470
- Ten.
- Any blurred vision or migraines?

06:26.595 --> 06:28.139
Just the occasional headache.

06:28.265 --> 06:31.309
Have you experienced any
hallucinations, auditory or visual?

06:31.434 --> 06:32.269
No.

06:32.394 --> 06:36.440
Have you suffered panic attacks
or depression in the past 30 days?

06:36.566 --> 06:37.858
None of those, no.

06:37.984 --> 06:41.738
Have you had any suicidal thoughts
or desires in the past year?

06:42.406 --> 06:43.490
No.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.831
Can you blink for me, Miss McQueen?

06:51.708 --> 06:54.169
There's fluid that's built up
behind your retina

06:54.295 --> 06:58.424
and we see that a lot in cases
of central serous retinopathy,

06:58.549 --> 07:01.219
but I'd expect
that you'd be experiencing

07:01.344 --> 07:03.680
quite a bit more pain
than you're feeling.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.018
McQueens are tough.

07:08.185 --> 07:09.270
Victoria,

07:09.395 --> 07:13.233
I was hoping to start by having you
answer a question for me.

07:14.693 --> 07:16.361
Who is Charlie Manx?

07:17.321 --> 07:20.908
Like I told the other doctors, I'm
seeing things much more clearly now.

07:21.409 --> 07:25.956
I believe the ophthalmologist came
to a different conclusion, but...

07:28.834 --> 07:32.339
I feel a lot better, thanks to her
and everyone else who checked me out.

07:32.464 --> 07:35.925
And school started up and I have
a portfolio I have to finish.

07:36.427 --> 07:38.763
There's really no need
to waste anyone's time.

07:43.101 --> 07:45.187
Why don't you want to tell me
who he is?

07:46.021 --> 07:48.273
I already told the police
everything I know.

07:48.398 --> 07:50.985
You know, sometimes
when the pain gets to be too much,

07:51.736 --> 07:55.074
people create a fictional reality
to escape it.

07:56.116 --> 07:59.078
So, who is Charlie Manx?

08:02.499 --> 08:04.250
The man who put Maggie in hospital.

08:04.376 --> 08:06.836
I should be holding her hand
as she goes into surgery.

08:06.961 --> 08:09.507
She has a team of doctors to help her
and so do you.

08:10.466 --> 08:13.386
Why is it so hard for you
to accept help?

08:13.512 --> 08:14.930
I don't...

08:15.055 --> 08:17.349
Are you more accustomed
to caring for yourself?

08:17.474 --> 08:21.062
I'm not the one hurting here.
Maggie is and she needs me.

08:21.604 --> 08:23.940
I'm authorized
under Massachusetts state law

08:24.065 --> 08:26.318
to extend your stay by up to 90 days.

08:27.194 --> 08:30.364
Those are the terms of your
conditional voluntary commitment.

08:30.489 --> 08:34.369
- That's what you signed up for.
- No, I didn't sign up for this.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.205
Did someone force you
to commit yourself?

08:37.330 --> 08:40.501
Oh, my God, no.
That's not what I meant. Jesus.

08:41.335 --> 08:45.632
But you did feel pressured into it?
Is that right?

08:47.092 --> 08:48.343
By who?

08:49.302 --> 08:50.470
Your father?

08:53.641 --> 08:55.143
I'm 18.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.563
I signed it.

08:57.688 --> 08:58.772
OK.

08:59.523 --> 09:02.317
I think that's enough for now.
Why don't you go on and...

09:02.443 --> 09:03.862
Yeah.

09:16.835 --> 09:18.420
I'm sorry, should I come back?

09:21.339 --> 09:23.843
There. I'll only be
a few more seconds.

09:35.231 --> 09:39.652
The reception is crap in here, but...
you hit the roommate jackpot, kid.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.239
Lady hasn't said boo in ages.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.880
Charlie...

10:32.464 --> 10:34.174
Manx.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.521
How do you know his name?

10:51.570 --> 10:54.072
Did my friend Maggie come to see you?

10:54.197 --> 10:57.451
Maggie, a girl with purple hair
and Scrabble tile earrings?

11:03.792 --> 11:05.919
Did Charlie Manx put you in here?

11:18.934 --> 11:20.687
Are you a strong creative?

11:28.988 --> 11:31.032
Do you know about Christmasland?

11:34.953 --> 11:36.413
Can you get me there?

11:36.538 --> 11:38.249
It's that time, ladies.

11:44.673 --> 11:46.300
Name and date of birth?

11:47.635 --> 11:49.011
Vic McQueen. Victoria.

11:49.136 --> 11:51.014
May 21st, 1994.

11:56.771 --> 11:59.565
No. The doctor didn't mention
any medication to me.

11:59.690 --> 12:01.651
He gave you 2mg
of lorazepam,

12:01.776 --> 12:03.987
and 25mg of Imitrex.

12:04.112 --> 12:05.197
Bottoms up.

12:07.908 --> 12:10.370
Failure to comply
can extend your stay here.

12:10.495 --> 12:13.665
Jolene knows the drill.
She never gives me any problems.

12:26.805 --> 12:28.349
Hello, Miss July.

12:28.933 --> 12:31.394
It's Thursday.
I've got your evening cocktail.

12:33.354 --> 12:36.817
Come on, now, Miss July.
You're usually up for a nightcap.

12:37.651 --> 12:39.403
Is she a bad influence on you?

12:41.072 --> 12:42.532
Come on, come on.

12:44.242 --> 12:45.743
We can do this the other way.

13:18.449 --> 13:19.491
Oh, no, she...

13:23.705 --> 13:24.873
Did she take her pills?

13:24.998 --> 13:27.208
Yeah, right after you left
she took them.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.714
Interfering with another patient's
medication schedule

13:31.839 --> 13:33.340
can extend your stay, too.

13:33.466 --> 13:36.595
Well, they think I'm nuts,
not an addict, so...

13:39.765 --> 13:42.142
She took them.
You're going to double-dose her.

13:44.437 --> 13:46.522
She's a paranoid schizophrenic.

13:46.647 --> 13:49.026
If she missed a dose
it won't stay a secret long,

13:49.151 --> 13:52.196
and you'll be the one
sleeping next to her all night.

13:55.992 --> 13:57.535
OK, then.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.038
Lights out.

14:17.725 --> 14:18.851
How did you sleep?

14:19.686 --> 14:22.022
The meds you prescribed
knocked me right out.

14:22.147 --> 14:25.109
Your anxiety and pain
have gone untreated up until now.

14:25.234 --> 14:27.904
I think it should provide
some welcome relief.

14:29.322 --> 14:32.743
So I spoke
to Miss Leigh's surgeon this morning.

14:33.536 --> 14:37.373
They repaired her fractured kneecap
and torn ACL,

14:37.498 --> 14:39.417
along with her other injuries.

14:39.543 --> 14:42.963
She's got a long road ahead
but they expect a full recovery.

14:45.216 --> 14:48.636
So you have no one to worry about.

14:49.178 --> 14:51.306
And nowhere else you need to be.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.395
Tell me about art school.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.983
I don't know much about art.

15:01.067 --> 15:05.531
I wish I did. However,
even I can see you are talented.

15:07.783 --> 15:08.784
Oh, my God...

15:09.452 --> 15:11.163
Who is the man in the painting?

15:13.665 --> 15:15.418
I just want to understand

15:15.543 --> 15:17.628
why art school is
so important to you.

15:17.753 --> 15:21.717
Why? Because I'm good at it.
And it's my way out of Haverhill.

15:22.259 --> 15:24.219
Why do you need
a way out of Haverhill?

15:24.553 --> 15:26.597
It beats getting knocked up
and married,

15:26.722 --> 15:28.683
living my whole life
in the same town,

15:28.808 --> 15:31.978
working some crap job
and then drinking myself to death.

15:34.523 --> 15:36.358
Did your parents grow up
in Haverhill?

15:39.695 --> 15:43.617
They had you young.
That can be hard on the parents.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.535
And the child.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.917
No harder than anyone else has it.

15:51.042 --> 15:53.712
But art would make things easier?

15:56.381 --> 15:58.550
It always made the world go quiet.

15:59.969 --> 16:02.347
When things got noisy at home?

16:04.098 --> 16:06.769
They fought. Yeah.

16:06.894 --> 16:08.687
Did it ever get physical?

16:15.111 --> 16:18.824
Nothing we talk about in here
will ever be said outside this room.

16:18.950 --> 16:19.784
OK?

16:21.702 --> 16:23.538
Did it ever get physical?

16:32.966 --> 16:34.676
Did your father hit your mother?

16:34.801 --> 16:37.221
She was no saint either, trust me.

16:39.306 --> 16:41.934
Was there something she could do
to make her responsible

16:42.060 --> 16:43.520
for your father's violence?

16:43.645 --> 16:46.523
She was responsible for her.
She slapped me around plenty.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.236
Did your father ever hit you?

16:50.361 --> 16:52.947
No. God, no, never.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.325
Never.

16:55.742 --> 16:59.663
It's not uncommon for a woman who has
been victimized by her husband

16:59.788 --> 17:02.208
to then victimize her children.

17:03.001 --> 17:04.877
We're not victims.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.131
We're not.

17:08.299 --> 17:10.800
It hardly ever happened.
Only after a bender.

17:11.593 --> 17:14.556
Do you think alcohol excuses abuse?

17:29.323 --> 17:32.035
It's a psych ward, Ma.
You can't catch anything here.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.163
People check into hospitals
feeling great every day, Vicky,

17:35.288 --> 17:37.665
and then they check out
with pseudomonas.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.338
OK, this should get you through.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.549
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:47.052 --> 17:49.721
Honestly, I don't know
how you sleep in that room.

17:50.556 --> 17:52.683
All that crap gave me
the heebie jeebies.

17:58.523 --> 17:59.858
Did Dad say anything?

17:59.983 --> 18:01.818
No, it was just Tiffany there.

18:03.696 --> 18:05.365
If he's not with her, where is he?

18:06.657 --> 18:08.368
A bar, probably.

18:11.038 --> 18:13.332
- That's his excuse?
- Yeah.

18:17.379 --> 18:20.298
You know you never need one
to come home, right?

18:22.843 --> 18:25.638
- Thanks for bringing this by, Ma.
- Yep.

18:32.813 --> 18:35.066
I can't be late.

18:36.859 --> 18:40.280
The boss hates it
when his girls are late.

18:40.906 --> 18:42.491
You need something in there?

18:42.616 --> 18:45.411
I need my skates
or I can't get to work.

18:45.911 --> 18:47.038
OK.

18:49.290 --> 18:52.127
Get my skates and we can leave.

19:10.356 --> 19:12.067
Ready? OK.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.194
One, two, three...

19:22.078 --> 19:23.873
Can this get us into Christmasland?

19:24.665 --> 19:26.584
Hurry up or we'll be late.

19:34.593 --> 19:36.345
How fast do you need to go?

19:36.929 --> 19:37.930
Fast.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.261
Appreciate the jailbreak, kid.

20:12.386 --> 20:15.641
- Where are we?
- The dark tunnels.

20:18.352 --> 20:19.479
Stop here.

20:36.164 --> 20:37.749
This is your knife?

20:37.875 --> 20:39.502
Wasn't always.

20:40.878 --> 20:42.129
Is, now.

20:43.422 --> 20:46.552
I didn't know you could have more.
I thought my dirt bike was it.

20:47.177 --> 20:51.391
I thought the same
after Charlie stole my skates,

20:52.016 --> 20:54.602
left me bedridden, hopeless...

20:55.144 --> 20:59.191
That chair found me
and got me moving again,

20:59.316 --> 21:02.988
until I was too weak
to get it up to speed.

21:04.072 --> 21:07.826
You travel along the Shorter Way?

21:07.951 --> 21:09.245
My bridge. Yeah.

21:09.912 --> 21:11.747
Did Maggie tell you that?

21:14.041 --> 21:16.837
We're all magicians
with different tricks.

21:16.962 --> 21:17.963
What's yours?

21:18.088 --> 21:19.715
It helps me find lost things.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.759
Lost children?

21:23.636 --> 21:26.931
It couldn't find my friend
after Manx took her to Christmasland.

21:27.558 --> 21:30.394
I was hoping maybe with your help
you could get me inside.

21:32.062 --> 21:34.232
There's something you should see.

22:13.903 --> 22:17.574
Every one of them
is in Christmasland.

22:18.408 --> 22:22.371
I've been tracking Charlie
since the '50s.

22:24.290 --> 22:28.211
Not one of these kids
has been seen since.

22:31.674 --> 22:33.676
There's got to be a way in.

22:33.801 --> 22:37.389
Sure, in the trunk of his Wraith.

22:37.931 --> 22:40.266
You don't want to take that ride.

22:42.395 --> 22:46.232
There isn't a strong creative
in the entire world of thought

22:46.357 --> 22:51.571
who has seen Christmasland
besides Manx.

22:52.072 --> 22:53.573
Not even me.

23:06.505 --> 23:10.051
Your friend is gone. I'm sorry.

23:11.219 --> 23:14.348
I know how hard that is to hear.

23:20.814 --> 23:22.274
Is one of them yours?

23:30.825 --> 23:32.453
Come with me.

23:53.185 --> 23:55.353
You never told me what yours is.

23:57.273 --> 23:58.941
Your magic trick.

24:01.027 --> 24:02.821
Up for a ride?

25:32.341 --> 25:34.051
Jolene.

26:23.525 --> 26:24.985
Damn!

28:21.537 --> 28:24.166
I know you're there, Jolene.

28:26.585 --> 28:30.590
I can smell you,
you dirty little whore.

29:14.391 --> 29:15.433
Oh, my God.

29:16.309 --> 29:18.186
Give it a minute.

29:24.610 --> 29:27.948
That was... God...
I've never felt so...

29:28.073 --> 29:29.116
Free?

29:33.079 --> 29:35.832
I bet you feel the same
on your bridge, don't you?

29:35.957 --> 29:37.208
Yeah.

29:38.002 --> 29:41.714
I tell you, kid, it never gets old.

29:43.591 --> 29:45.177
But Manx did.

29:45.302 --> 29:48.638
Right in front of me,
after you destroyed his car.

29:48.763 --> 29:50.433
Just the engine.

29:51.893 --> 29:53.060
Best I could do.

29:54.478 --> 29:56.732
Should slow him down for a bit.

29:56.857 --> 29:59.359
If you want to stop Charlie,

30:00.152 --> 30:03.031
you have to destroy the Wraith.

30:04.574 --> 30:05.408
OK.

30:05.533 --> 30:08.454
Well, when we get back,

30:09.121 --> 30:10.748
we can find it together.

30:10.873 --> 30:12.625
Me, you, Maggie...

30:12.750 --> 30:15.629
My fight's long over.

30:17.964 --> 30:19.549
He won.

30:20.175 --> 30:22.762
- Every time, he won.
- No.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.263
And I'm tired.

30:25.681 --> 30:28.435
But I couldn't rest...

30:29.478 --> 30:32.940
...until I knew
someone could pick up the fight.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.276
- Now I do.
- No, I couldn't even save Haley.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.779
Then you save the next one.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.616
You're powerful enough, Vic.

30:42.243 --> 30:44.828
You just met me.
You haven't even seen what I can do.

30:44.954 --> 30:46.706
He visited me.

30:49.584 --> 30:51.711
I haven't seen him in years.

30:53.965 --> 30:55.758
And there he was...

30:57.134 --> 31:00.931
...standing in my room,
asking me if I knew...

31:01.431 --> 31:02.891
the Shorter Way.

31:04.184 --> 31:06.854
I don't need to see what you can do.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.482
I saw it in Charlie's eyes.

31:11.235 --> 31:12.945
He fears you.

31:15.572 --> 31:20.245
When you get back, tell the doctors
what they need to hear.

31:20.370 --> 31:24.709
They'll let you go with some pills,
tell you they'll help.

31:24.834 --> 31:26.002
They won't.

31:28.462 --> 31:31.466
They'll dull your mind
and your knife.

31:32.801 --> 31:36.222
You need to keep at full strength

31:36.347 --> 31:38.808
to take on Charlie.

31:42.521 --> 31:44.064
You're not coming back?

31:50.780 --> 31:52.657
I never had kids.

31:53.366 --> 31:55.578
I always thought I would.

31:55.703 --> 32:01.209
There was a time when I thought
Charlie would be their father.

32:02.919 --> 32:05.255
I knew him before.

32:06.298 --> 32:09.385
He was handsome, charming,

32:09.927 --> 32:12.055
sweet, even.

32:13.098 --> 32:17.770
But every strong creative
pays a price.

32:18.312 --> 32:22.942
And Charlie paid
the steepest price of all.

32:23.068 --> 32:24.486
His soul.

32:25.905 --> 32:28.115
Deep down, I knew it.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.076
What he was.

32:30.743 --> 32:33.955
I didn't want to see it, because...

32:36.333 --> 32:37.835
I loved him.

32:42.673 --> 32:44.802
That was my excuse.

32:49.014 --> 32:50.308
Kill him.

32:52.352 --> 32:53.395
For me...

32:54.479 --> 32:55.647
...for them...

32:57.024 --> 32:58.609
...for Haley...

32:59.068 --> 33:00.319
...for the next one.

33:01.779 --> 33:04.741
Or the cycle will go on forever.

34:47.694 --> 34:51.114
I've thought about your question,
Doctor, and why I didn't answer it.

34:51.532 --> 34:53.617
My question about your father?

34:54.327 --> 34:56.996
Your first question -
who is Charlie Manx?

34:58.122 --> 34:59.832
I knew the answer when you asked it,

34:59.958 --> 35:04.421
but I wasn't ready to say it
out loud, to face the reality.

35:04.547 --> 35:06.591
But I am, now, I think.

35:09.636 --> 35:12.890
The truth is,
Charlie Manx isn't a real man.

35:13.849 --> 35:16.435
He doesn't drive a real car
or live in the real world.

35:16.561 --> 35:18.689
He lives in Christmasland.

35:19.398 --> 35:23.235
A figment of imagination,
just like my bridge.

35:25.029 --> 35:29.659
When I felt lost I would imagine it
and it would appear...

35:30.868 --> 35:32.162
...and when I went over,

35:32.288 --> 35:35.082
I felt different
than I'd ever felt in my life.

35:36.500 --> 35:41.172
Like I... left reality behind,
and had been transported to a world

35:41.298 --> 35:43.843
where anything you can imagine
is possible.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.220
A world of thought.

35:46.804 --> 35:49.515
Right. Like... when you paint?

35:50.309 --> 35:52.519
That was his face in my print.

35:55.105 --> 35:57.483
Not the face of the man
I saw at the bus station,

35:57.609 --> 36:01.154
but the face of the real
Charlie Manx, a soulless monster.

36:03.490 --> 36:06.869
I believed I was the only one
with the power to stop him.

36:07.703 --> 36:10.290
I believed I needed
to find a way into Christmasland,

36:10.415 --> 36:13.084
so I could kill Charlie Manx
and save them all.

36:13.585 --> 36:16.922
I wasn't going to stop
until I did it, no matter the cost.

36:19.008 --> 36:20.844
That was my reality.

36:24.139 --> 36:27.644
But the truth is, all I've been
trying to do is escape my reality.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.815
Where Hayley is gone,
and isn't coming back.

36:34.068 --> 36:36.278
Where Maggie was run over
and nearly died,

36:36.403 --> 36:39.198
where I don't have the power
to save anyone.

36:42.619 --> 36:44.120
You know, watching...

36:45.915 --> 36:48.626
...watching the people I love
in pain got to be too much,

36:48.751 --> 36:50.002
so I just...

36:51.587 --> 36:54.758
I created a fictional reality
to escape it.

36:55.258 --> 36:56.885
Just like you said.

37:04.353 --> 37:08.065
But if you knew
what you said was fiction,

37:08.190 --> 37:11.361
why didn't you tell the police
the truth three days ago?

37:12.237 --> 37:14.864
I didn't know it was the truth
three days ago.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.744
But I do now, thanks to you.

37:20.746 --> 37:22.623
So if it's alright with you...

37:23.250 --> 37:26.086
I'd like to go back to school
and finish my portfolio.

37:28.755 --> 37:30.216
You know...

37:35.389 --> 37:39.184
I'll sign your release.
Under two conditions.

37:39.727 --> 37:43.022
You fill a prescription
for lorazepam,

37:43.148 --> 37:46.359
and you remove yourself
from your current living situation.

37:47.193 --> 37:49.196
I need to be certain
I'm releasing you

37:49.321 --> 37:51.198
into a safe environment.

37:51.824 --> 37:53.117
You are.

37:54.578 --> 37:56.663
I told you, he never hit me.
It's safe.

37:57.414 --> 38:01.169
But it's my job to look out
for your emotional health

38:01.294 --> 38:03.087
as well as physical, Miss McQueen.

38:05.590 --> 38:07.509
I know where I can stay.

38:08.093 --> 38:09.178
Can I go?

38:12.724 --> 38:15.351
Victoria, listen to me.

38:17.395 --> 38:20.649
There's nothing you can do
to save your father, either.

38:24.863 --> 38:26.573
Am I free to go?

38:32.497 --> 38:34.707
OK, here we go. Slow.

38:34.832 --> 38:36.959
Nice and take it easy. Here you go.

38:41.173 --> 38:42.424
I got her.

38:46.179 --> 38:49.349
You'll need to sign
your discharge papers before you go.

39:07.662 --> 39:09.581
- Careful, careful.
- Sorry.

39:13.502 --> 39:16.256
I wanted to be here
but they wouldn't let me out.

39:16.381 --> 39:19.425
I told you they would think
you were crazy. You didn't listen.

39:20.051 --> 39:21.595
Well, neither did you.

39:25.558 --> 39:28.228
I ditched you for a reason.
He said come alone.

39:29.437 --> 39:33.067
- You should have listened.
- Yeah, and let you have all the fun?

39:36.362 --> 39:38.573
By the time I got to you, you were...

39:39.491 --> 39:41.827
And I didn't... I didn't know if...

39:43.537 --> 39:45.080
I'm still here.

39:45.874 --> 39:47.250
Mostly.

39:50.837 --> 39:52.298
We're going to kill him.

39:53.048 --> 39:56.135
For what he did to you, to Daniel,
to Haley... and I know how.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.139
I was roomed with Jolene.

39:59.264 --> 40:02.017
The old woman you met.
Her inscape took us someplace.

40:02.142 --> 40:04.896
All we have to do is destroy
the Wraith. I saw it, Maggie.

40:05.021 --> 40:06.856
- He got old...
- Destroy the Wraith?

40:08.024 --> 40:09.150
Look at me, Vic.

40:09.775 --> 40:13.405
Six pins holding my knee together.
It hurts just to breathe.

40:13.947 --> 40:16.409
And that car ran me down on its own.

40:17.702 --> 40:21.080
If you think you can destroy it
you need to check yourself back in.

40:22.625 --> 40:23.792
OK, ask your bag, then.

40:24.418 --> 40:27.463
If you don't believe me, ask it
whether we can kill Manx.

40:27.588 --> 40:31.301
I'm not asking the bag another thing.
The last answer nearly killed me.

40:31.426 --> 40:32.302
Maggie...

40:34.679 --> 40:37.600
I never should have even
dragged you into this mess.

40:38.225 --> 40:41.188
I came to you. Remember?
And you came here for Daniel.

40:41.313 --> 40:44.107
You cannot...
You can't just give up on him now.

40:44.232 --> 40:45.609
I saw him.

40:46.401 --> 40:50.114
While I was on the ground, bleeding,
Daniel was looking down at me.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.036
His teeth were like razors.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.164
And blood was pouring
out of his mouth.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.333
Next thing,
I was waking up in recovery,

40:59.458 --> 41:02.087
and it wasn't the anesthesia,
it was the Wraith.

41:02.879 --> 41:06.258
When that car hit me,
it showed him to me,

41:06.384 --> 41:08.469
and it wasn't a nightmare.

41:08.594 --> 41:09.637
It was real.

41:13.850 --> 41:15.686
And you've seen it, too.

41:16.687 --> 41:17.938
With Haley.

41:19.649 --> 41:22.193
- We can save them.
- They are gone.

41:22.902 --> 41:24.655
They're not coming back.

41:29.660 --> 41:32.622
Manx will keep taking children
unless someone tries to stop him.

41:32.747 --> 41:35.208
Jolene tried.

41:36.459 --> 41:39.505
Take your meds,
finish your portfolio, go to college.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.465
That's all you need to do.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.428
But I need to go home.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.098
See you around, Brat.
