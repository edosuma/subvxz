{\an8}What the (bleep) are
you doing on Dyckman,

00:07.173 --> 00:09.509
{\an8}performing for a bunch
of (bleep) who wanna
see a basketball game

00:09.576 --> 00:11.077
{\an8}when you're
not being paid?

00:11.144 --> 00:12.412
{\an8}You just move wrong.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.214
{\an8}You keep giving these
(bleep) other (bleep)

00:14.280 --> 00:17.317
{\an8}to talk about outside
of your God given talent.

00:17.384 --> 00:20.320
{\an8}What's up,
what's up,
what's up?

00:20.387 --> 00:23.123
{\an9}Who's this?

00:20.387 --> 00:23.123
{\an8}I've actually been
famous before you.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.392
{\an8}Yeah, I doubt that, baby.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.726
{\an8}(Rich)
I need a favor.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.726
{\an7}All right.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.228
{\an8}I'm speaking
about Sidney Starr.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.228
{\an7}Mm-hmm.

00:28.294 --> 00:31.264
{\an8}She needs guidance.

00:28.294 --> 00:31.264
{\an8}Had to take on this project?

00:31.331 --> 00:34.334
{\an8}I honestly am not doing
that good right now.

00:34.401 --> 00:38.071
{\an7}What's going on?
Let the big sister help you.

00:38.138 --> 00:41.241
{\an9}How's Cyn?

00:38.138 --> 00:41.241
{\an7}She's keeping
herself occupied.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.643
{\an7}I wouldn't say that
her behavior is indicative

00:43.710 --> 00:46.980
{\an7}of someone who's
ready to get married.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.748
{\an8}(baby crying)

00:48.815 --> 00:50.750
{\an8}I've been depressed
for a few months now,

00:50.817 --> 00:52.185
{\an8}but you can't
even see that,

00:52.252 --> 00:54.020
{\an8}'cause all you do
is (bleep) work!

00:54.087 --> 00:55.922
{\an7}I'm fine if
me and you break up.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.290
{\an8}I have to go.

00:57.357 --> 00:58.691
{\an8}You can go.
I don't care.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.030
{\an8}♪♪

01:29.222 --> 01:32.158
{\an8}♪♪

01:35.562 --> 01:37.430
{\an7}Eminem dropped a surprise
album, "Kamikaze."

01:37.497 --> 01:39.566
{\an7}You guys heard
that bull(bleep) I'm sure.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.434
{\an8}Is that because
he actually dissed you

01:41.501 --> 01:43.369
{\an8}and you have yet to respond,
but you mad as (bleep),

01:43.436 --> 01:44.871
or you scared to death
and you know he would

01:44.938 --> 01:46.339
flame you if you even
try it, is that why?

01:46.406 --> 01:48.541
{\an5}No, Rem, that's not why.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.541
Why then?

01:48.608 --> 01:50.844
{\an1}I like rap where people
are saying things, that's all.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.913
{\an5}I just finished shooting
my new Revolt show,
"State of the Culture."

01:53.980 --> 01:58.084
"State of the Culture"
is hip-hop based topical show

01:58.151 --> 02:01.754
starring myself, along with
my cohosts, Remy Ma,

02:01.821 --> 02:03.990
Jinx, and Scottie Beam.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.358
It's a great show,
great times,

02:05.425 --> 02:07.126
where we just dissect things
that we feel

02:07.193 --> 02:10.029
{\an5}are extremely important
and need to be
discussed in the culture.

02:10.096 --> 02:11.831
What did you think?
Give it to me raw.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.466
{\an8}I thought it was great
for a show, honestly.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.735
{\an8}I think Remy was being
Remy, that was great.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.604
She was doing
what she does.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.273
(clucking)
Chicken!

02:20.340 --> 02:21.908
{\an1}Okay, all right,
all right!

02:21.975 --> 02:24.511
{\an5}(Joe)
Now that Remy is about
to have the golden child,

02:24.577 --> 02:25.812
Pap has been begging her

02:25.879 --> 02:27.780
to slow down
on the career front.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.616
But that's where I come in.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.751
Remy's even more
opinionated than I am,

02:31.818 --> 02:33.620
so sitting down
and telling her truths

02:33.686 --> 02:36.356
on "State of the Culture"
is light work for her.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.658
Can't wait to see
what our views look like

02:38.725 --> 02:40.593
{\an5}and what people, you know--

02:38.725 --> 02:40.593
You nervous about it?

02:40.660 --> 02:43.596
No, but I look at it
like this.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.732
I got about what,
six million followers?

02:45.798 --> 02:49.402
If 15% of that watches,

02:49.469 --> 02:51.204
we got at least a million.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.874
{\an4}10% of your social following
will actually watch
or purchase something.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.210
But mine's a little bit
higher because, you know,

02:57.277 --> 03:00.313
{\an5}they really deal with me.

02:57.277 --> 03:00.313
Because of Black Love, eh!

03:00.380 --> 03:03.249
{\an5}Because of Black Love.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.249
{\an1}Yeah, I need to talk
to you about Black Love.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.084
{\an6}Oh, boy.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.084
{\an1}Honestly.
No, not that--

03:05.151 --> 03:07.554
{\an5}What you do?

03:05.151 --> 03:07.554
I didn't do anything.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.457
{\an1}I need help with the black
Dominican Salvi love.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.226
Okay, what's going on?

03:13.293 --> 03:15.128
{\an1}I need you
to talk to Cyn.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.996
{\an1}Listen, y'all are
the household

03:17.063 --> 03:20.400
{\an4}that for all intents
and purposes we're
trying to emulate.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.569
I need help.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.270
{\an5}Has it changed more so
since the baby
has been involved?

03:24.337 --> 03:26.573
{\an1}Since month four
of pregnancy.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.875
{\an6}Okay.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.875
And just recently
she finally said,

03:28.942 --> 03:30.476
"All right, maybe I have
postpartum depression."

03:30.543 --> 03:32.345
I know a lot of people
that have postpartum.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.147
That's like a real thing.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.715
{\an1}It's also very real
for the person

03:35.782 --> 03:37.684
{\an1}living with the person
with postpartum depression.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.219
{\an5}This is true.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.219
So, like if somebody

03:40.286 --> 03:42.255
{\an4}suffered from depression,
like if you not
getting it together,

03:42.322 --> 03:43.756
{\an1}yeah, you about
to (bleep) me up,

03:43.823 --> 03:45.458
{\an1}and then we all
gonna be (bleep) up.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.628
I can definitely empathize
with Cyn.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.130
I was very young
when I had my son.

03:51.197 --> 03:53.933
There's really
no way to prepare

03:54.000 --> 03:55.935
for the way
that your life alters

03:56.002 --> 03:57.704
when you bring a child
into the world.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.440
{\an5}I'm busting my ass...

03:57.770 --> 04:00.440
Oh, you know
I see that.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.141
{\an1}because I've had
15 years of the grind.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.577
{\an1}She's not really
seeing it that way.

04:04.644 --> 04:09.082
{\an5}So all she's seeing is
your man is leveling up
and you're depressed.

04:09.148 --> 04:12.652
{\an5}So what do you--
What do you think
she should be doing?

04:12.719 --> 04:14.821
{\an5}Do you think maybe
she has too much
time at home?

04:14.887 --> 04:18.124
We should get a nanny.
She don't recognize it.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.459
{\an1}I'm not saying it's for me.
I'm saying it's for you.

04:20.526 --> 04:21.995
{\an6}It helps.

04:20.526 --> 04:21.995
She against it.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.063
{\an5}I'm talk to her.
I'm gonna go sit down.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.063

05:13.780 --> 05:16.015
the situation
at Infinity's foster home

05:16.082 --> 05:18.017
got a little too much
for her to bear,

{\an5}You look cutesy, too.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.748
{\an3}Thank you.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.450
How you feel?
I just came from work.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.887
{\an5}Girl, I know.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.887
{\an1}Working with your
psychotic man, going crazy.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.390
{\an8}So, Joe asked me to go
and sit down

09:51.457 --> 09:55.027
{\an8}and have a woman-to-woman
talk with his girl.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.829
They just hit
a little bump in the road,

09:56.896 --> 09:59.065
and if I can help
smooth out the pavement,

09:59.131 --> 10:00.366
that's what I'm gonna do.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.168
Well, I spoke to Joe.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.970
We were talking at work
the other day.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.105
He kind of
mentions that...

10:06.172 --> 10:08.374
{\an5}he doesn't really
understand what's
going on with you.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.476
So I'm like,
okay I'ma talk to her,

10:10.543 --> 10:13.212
but first, I need to know
both sides of the story.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.115
{\an8}I kind of have mixed feelings
about Joe asking me

10:16.182 --> 10:19.485
{\an8}to talk to "his" friend
after our huge blowup.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.821
He hasn't even tried to
speak to me himself.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.190
But all I really care about

10:24.256 --> 10:27.026
is me and Joe finding a way

10:27.093 --> 10:29.161
to get back
to our relationship.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.664
I still feel like we should
be in that honeymoon stage.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.033
{\an1}I wanna get married.
Like, I want a big family.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.668
I want kids.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.668
{\an3}Right.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.703
{\an4}So we were like,
"All right, we're gonna
have kids in four years."

10:37.770 --> 10:39.005
That happened way before.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.373
{\an1}And I gained
all this weight,

10:40.439 --> 10:41.574
so I started seeing
myself differently.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.142
Like, all this (bleep).

10:43.209 --> 10:45.011
Then after giving birth,

10:45.077 --> 10:46.979
{\an1}now I'm dealing with
postpartum depression.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.514
{\an1}And then while
that's happening,

10:48.581 --> 10:50.349
now he's getting
all these jobs.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.618
Me and my husband,
although we may seem

10:52.685 --> 10:54.787
{\an5}like we have
the perfect
relationship--

10:54.854 --> 10:56.856
{\an5}It's kind of close,
I must say,
it's kind of close.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.190
{\an1}(laughing)

10:56.922 --> 10:58.190
Kind of close.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.126
{\an5}But we go through--

10:58.257 --> 11:00.126
It look like it!

11:00.192 --> 11:02.228
{\an5}We through (bleep),
and we also had to
get to this point.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.530
We had to learn
ways to communicate.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.865
If I'm telling you how
I feel from my heart.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.400
I'm crying, I'm pouring
my heart out to you,

11:07.466 --> 11:08.868
and you're like,
"But this and this thing."

11:08.934 --> 11:10.970
You're talking over me,
it makes me feel unworthy.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.738
{\an5}It makes me
feel less than...

11:11.037 --> 11:12.738
{\an1}Mmm.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.206
And nobody wants
to feel less than.

11:14.273 --> 11:15.708
I was literally in tears.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.577
Like, yo, I'm, like,
screaming for help.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.680
{\an4}You acknowledge
that I'm going through
postpartum depression,

11:21.747 --> 11:25.051
{\an4}right, and you're
still telling me,
"Well, figure it out."

11:25.117 --> 11:27.753
I'm pretty sure, in your
postpartum depression,

11:27.820 --> 11:30.356
{\an5}that you haven't been
the Cyn that he fell
in love with neither.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.525
{\an5}I can-- I will
admit to that.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.525
The same way he hasn't been.

11:32.591 --> 11:33.993
{\an5}I will admit to that.

11:32.591 --> 11:33.993
So, you guys have to

11:34.060 --> 11:35.661
figure out how y'all
can get that back.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.764
{\an1}When I was away,
I could only see my husband,

11:38.831 --> 11:41.233
{\an4}have sex with my husband,
and that's only if I didn't
get in trouble,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.269
{\an5}which I stayed
the (bleep)
out from trouble.

11:43.335 --> 11:46.539
We would see each other
every six to seven weeks

11:46.605 --> 11:48.741
{\an5}for 48 hours.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.741
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.010
He has no phones,
I had no phone.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.312
There was no internet.
There was nothing.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.515
{\an5}And now that I'm home,
we came to the conclusion,
"You know what?

11:56.582 --> 11:58.684
We're gonna
set aside that time."

11:58.751 --> 11:59.919
Once a weekend
or every two weeks.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.754
{\an5}"I want me time
with you, us."

11:59.985 --> 12:01.754
{\an3}Exactly.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.523
{\an5}Get a babysitter--
And he told me
about that, too.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.158
{\an1}Oh, my God,
Remy, I'm terrified.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.560
He told me you don't
wanna get a nanny.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.328
{\an5}Are you gonna get a nanny?

12:07.626 --> 12:09.328
I want a nanny.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.729
I'm getting a nanny,
because how could y'all

12:10.796 --> 12:13.265
really spend
that intimate time

12:13.332 --> 12:15.201
if you have to keep
worrying about the baby.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.902
If you don't feel
totally safe,

12:16.969 --> 12:18.537
there's cameras
everywhere.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.539
{\an4}That bitch gonna wear
a body cam.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.539
{\an3}(laughing)

12:20.606 --> 12:25.010
I am 1,000%
not with the nanny thing.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.846
I don't think
I have it in me

12:26.912 --> 12:29.348
to trust a stranger
with my child.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.450
But I am here

12:31.517 --> 12:35.321
for the "no phone
and quality time" rule.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.823
Maybe if it comes
from Remy,

12:37.890 --> 12:39.558
he will take her advice.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.161
{\an1}(bleep) that.
No, I'm not (bleep) playing!

12:42.228 --> 12:45.564

I'm not playing, no.

12:45.631 --> 12:46.632
{\an1}Not with my baby.
You've met my baby.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.659
It was comfortable.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.128
{\an5}Who's that?

16:00.726 --> 16:03.128
Ah, I think it's--

16:03.195 --> 16:04.530
Oh, it's Jonathan.

16:04.596 --> 16:08.534
{\an8}Hey!

16:04.596 --> 16:08.534
{\an9}Hey!

16:08.600 --> 16:10.402
{\an7}Hi, Jon!

16:10.469 --> 16:12.037
{\an5}Hey, Infinity.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.037
{\an3}Hi!

16:12.104 --> 16:14.206
{\an5}Nice to meet you, my love.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.206
Nice to meet you too.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.842
{\an5}How are you?

16:14.273 --> 16:16.842
Finally, right?
And not only FaceTime.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.078
{\an5}I think I'm gonna
go upstairs and give
you guys some privacy.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.313
{\an5}Come on, y'all.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.313
Good night, Skylar.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.048
Good night!

16:23.115 --> 16:25.250
Bye, Jonathan.
Bye, Mom.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.453
{\an8}I'm devastated about the news
that Anais is suffering

16:27.519 --> 16:29.355
{\an8}though, like,
some sort of mental issues.

16:29.421 --> 16:30.989
And more than anything,
it kills me

16:31.056 --> 16:33.859
that I'm not by her side when
she's in such a dark place.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.294
But there's nothing
left for me to do,

16:35.361 --> 16:37.363
so I'm gonna take
Rich's advice and just,

16:37.429 --> 16:39.565
you know, back off and hope
that she comes around

16:39.631 --> 16:41.066
whenever she's ready.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.868
And, Anais is not
my only friend

16:42.935 --> 16:44.470
who's going through so much.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.438
Yandy done went out
and got herself

16:46.505 --> 16:48.674
a whole new addition
to her family.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.442
This is crazy.
Like, I just--

16:50.509 --> 16:52.745
I can't believe, like,
it's a full house.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.714
{\an1}And now I got a big girl,
which is amazing

16:55.781 --> 16:58.984
because she's so much fun,
and then the kids love her.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.587
I know, I'm like, damn,
this is moving so fast.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.690
{\an1}I had no idea that
it would turn into this

17:04.757 --> 17:06.258
{\an1}when she called me
talking about

17:06.325 --> 17:08.794
{\an4}she wanted to run away
and I wasn't gonna be
able to find her.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.194
She was running away
from home?

17:10.262 --> 17:11.663
She was running away
from her foster home.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.832
{\an1}Since she's been here,
I've tried to reach out.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.501
{\an1}She has an attorney
on her case.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.770
{\an1}The attorney's
on vacation right now.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.438
No one has called me back.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.006
(Jonathan)
Wait a minute.

17:21.073 --> 17:24.309
Is Yandy trying to tell me
that she took Infinity

17:24.376 --> 17:27.279
out of the foster home
without permission?

17:27.346 --> 17:29.381
Now, I'm no lawyer,

17:29.448 --> 17:31.583
but this (bleep)
sounds illegal.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.019
Maybe sure
you really, like,

17:34.086 --> 17:35.988
cross all your T's
and dot your I's

17:36.054 --> 17:37.289
because she's
still a minor,

17:37.356 --> 17:40.092
and her guardians
are the state.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.394
{\an1}You know what I'm saying?
So, if she's here with you,

17:42.461 --> 17:44.963
and the state is supposed
to be her guardian,

17:45.030 --> 17:46.932
then in essence you're
harboring a minor

17:46.999 --> 17:49.601
{\an1}that you're not supposed to,
and this is somehow,

17:49.668 --> 17:52.337
I think, against the law.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.441
{\an5}I'm breaking the law
by going to get
someone that I mentor

17:55.507 --> 17:57.342
{\an1}that said that she
was going to run away?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.911
I don't know
what the laws are,

17:58.977 --> 18:02.981
{\an5}but I think
you're breaking
the law regardless.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.616
{\an5}(Yandy)
Everything just happened
so fast,

18:04.683 --> 18:07.519
and I didn't have time
to think about

18:07.586 --> 18:11.156
all the legalities that go
into a situation like this.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.692
But Infinity was unhappy,

18:13.759 --> 18:16.762
and all I did was give her
a safe and loving home.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.965
How can that possibly be
against the law?

18:20.032 --> 18:23.469
{\an1}Her attorney comes back
next week, so I don't know.

18:23.535 --> 18:27.206
{\an1}I'll guess I'll find out
from him when this happened.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.475
{\an7}How do you self-help
yourself through depression?

18:29.541 --> 18:32.010
{\an7}You know, if I have to
leave, like, I will.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.180
{\an8}Some jerk leaked
my meats online,

18:35.247 --> 18:36.748
{\an8}and I got a sex toy deal.

18:36.815 --> 18:39.084
{\an8}As your career's grown
on a musical level,

18:39.151 --> 18:42.421

meet with these people,

20:30.596 --> 20:32.364

20:32.431 --> 20:34.132
I don't think
you should do it.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.835
{\an4}Why?

20:34.199 --> 20:36.835

20:36.902 --> 20:39.538

20:39.605 --> 20:42.074
why would you go left field

20:42.140 --> 20:44.443
It's not porn, though.

It's just weird, Ma.

{\an1}All right, look at it
like this, though.

you know, XYZ.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.764
Look, I have a contract
in place already.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.733

they handled--

21:13.872 --> 21:15.707
Did you read
the contract?

I've been caught up,

on top of...

{\an5}The business.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.921

just let them go

21:32.424 --> 21:33.659
{\an1}and assume
that everything

21:33.725 --> 21:34.826
{\an1}is gonna be in your
best interests.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.095
{\an1}You have to
oversee everything.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.264

don't take no damn molds

this was gonna be
a good idea,

21:45.570 --> 21:47.773

more doubts.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.374

I already signed it,

A big part of why

23:50.796 --> 23:53.198
I sent Cyn to talk to Remy

23:53.265 --> 23:55.500
so she can get
some woman advice

23:55.567 --> 23:58.036
on how to deal
with depression,

23:58.103 --> 24:00.872
and postpartum,
and things of that nature.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.108
The only thing that matters
to me right now

24:03.175 --> 24:05.977
is that Cyn is back to
a healthy place mentally.

24:06.044 --> 24:09.948
I think she's focused
on the wrong thing right now.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.883
The other day when we was
having that conversation,

24:11.950 --> 24:13.552
you said something like,

24:13.618 --> 24:15.954
{\an1}well, you know, if I
have to leave, like, I will.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.123
{\an1}But that's not an option
for me at all.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.559
{\an1}Like, I feel like
we could fix this (bleep).

24:20.625 --> 24:22.928
Are you
no longer depressed?

24:22.994 --> 24:25.397
I guess that's where
my confusion is coming.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.966
{\an1}No, I am depressed,
but it's-- I've--

24:28.033 --> 24:30.268
I have to combat
those feelings.

24:30.335 --> 24:31.770
I'm doing a lot
of self therapy.

24:31.837 --> 24:34.039
{\an1}I'm in the studio
singing my little heart out.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.140
It's therapeutic for me.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.808
I'm staying busy.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.244
{\an1}Like... I'm doing
okay right now.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.812
No, you're not.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.248
{\an5}As someone who's suffered
from depression
my entire life,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.617
I can understand what Cyn's
going through right now.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.720
She seems to be confusing
her issues with her depression

24:48.787 --> 24:50.755
with our relationship issues.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.892
And before we can fix
anything going on with us,

24:53.959 --> 24:57.329
I need her to focus on her.

24:57.395 --> 25:00.332
{\an5}How do you
self-help yourself
through depression?

25:00.398 --> 25:02.067
You think I need to go
talk to somebody else?

25:02.133 --> 25:03.668
{\an1}You think I should
sit with a therapist

25:03.735 --> 25:05.203
and tell them
like, "Hey."

25:05.270 --> 25:07.439
Or I should go to the doctor
and for them to diagnose me

25:07.505 --> 25:09.140
with postpartum depression
and put me on some pills?

25:09.207 --> 25:11.476
Baby, I don't--
I do not know.

25:11.543 --> 25:14.679
I'm just down
to try it all, so...

25:14.746 --> 25:17.616
{\an1}I am dealing with
postpartum depression,

25:17.682 --> 25:23.188
{\an1}but I still have an issue
with our relationship.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.991
I don't feel like I have to
sit with a doctor right now.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.360
I don't wanna get
prescribed medicine.

25:28.426 --> 25:30.095
I kind of wanna
handle this on my own.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.297
What would really
make me feel better

25:32.364 --> 25:34.266
is Joey and I
working through

25:34.332 --> 25:36.935
our relationship
issues together.

25:37.002 --> 25:39.738
{\an1}I wanna be able to unload
all this (bleep) on you

25:39.804 --> 25:43.141
and not make you feel like
you're carrying everything.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.644
{\an1}But I also
want to be happy.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.579
{\an1}Like, I also wanna
feel fulfilled.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.915
I'm not that selfish.

25:49.981 --> 25:53.151
I wanna do anything
that we have to do--

25:53.218 --> 25:54.920
We, as a team--

25:54.986 --> 25:58.890
for you to get back to
the person that you were.

25:58.957 --> 26:00.625
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.895
{\an1}It's great that you think
you're handling this a-okay.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.498
I've been waving
and kicking

26:06.564 --> 26:08.767
and screaming over here
for however long

26:08.833 --> 26:10.802
dying for my partner back.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.004
Baby, I don't know
what to tell you.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.907
{\an4}You have your own opinion
on how I'm handling
my postpartum depression.

26:15.974 --> 26:20.145
{\an1}Like, and you're wrong.
I don't know what to tell you.

26:20.211 --> 26:21.913
{\an8}The case worker is saying

26:21.980 --> 26:24.883
{\an8}if I don't go through
the proper procedures

26:24.950 --> 26:28.320
{\an8}the system could come
and take my kids.

26:28.386 --> 26:30.722
{\an8}Tonight, I have to
tell her, like,

26:30.789 --> 26:33.558
{\an8}that I have to take her
to a group home.

After talking to Remy and Pap,

26:55.914 --> 26:57.082
I'm kind of starting
to question

26:57.148 --> 26:58.917
if this whole sex toy deal
is right for me.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.686
{\an8}On one hand,
this is a million dollars.

27:01.753 --> 27:03.088
{\an8}And on the other hand,

27:03.154 --> 27:07.592
{\an8}I want people to see me
a real artist, not a porn star.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.761
There's a short form
contract in place already,

27:09.828 --> 27:11.463
so whether I like it or not,

27:11.529 --> 27:13.198
I might be
forced to do this.

27:13.264 --> 27:16.668
So, I'm here in L.A.
to get some more details.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.870
{\an5}How you doing?

27:16.735 --> 27:18.870
{\an3}All right.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.271
{\an1}What's going on, man?
Good to see you.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.873
{\an8}Yeah, what's up?

27:20.338 --> 27:21.873
{\an8}Thao. Nice to meet you.

this is our COO.

27:36.087 --> 27:37.956
{\an7}Why don't you hop
into who we are, bro?

27:38.023 --> 27:39.657
{\an8}(Chad)
Um, family business.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.027
{\an8}My dad started it back
in 1976.

27:42.093 --> 27:43.395
{\an8}And we've been a leader
in the industry

27:43.461 --> 27:46.264
{\an8}for, like, the entire time
that we've existed.

27:46.331 --> 27:50.668
{\an8}With the penis molds,
how much would you say
a year like they make?

27:50.735 --> 27:53.004
{\an1}That has the potential
to do, you know,

27:53.071 --> 27:56.908
six, seven figures
in revenue a month.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.412
Six to seven figures a month?
Pff!

28:00.478 --> 28:02.047
Just because of what God,

28:02.113 --> 28:05.517
what the Lord has
blessed me with?

28:05.583 --> 28:08.119
Maybe this deal
ain't so bad after all.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.255
So, to do this molding,
do I have to be like--

28:10.321 --> 28:13.291
like rock (bleep),
semi (bleep), or...

28:13.358 --> 28:15.293
almost (bleep)?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.929
{\an4}My understanding
is your semi (bleep)
would be good enough, man.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.398
{\an5}Yeah.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.398
{\an3}Wow.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.133
{\an4}One of the things
that we've got
a lot of requests for

28:22.200 --> 28:24.836
{\an4}as well with your product
is that we make it
harness compatible.

28:24.903 --> 28:28.239
All right, so...
when you say harness...

28:28.306 --> 28:30.975
You know what I'm saying,
'cause I know...

28:31.042 --> 28:33.311
I know what a harness is.
You know what I'm saying?

28:33.378 --> 28:35.013
I don't know if they know
what a harness is.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.881
No clue.

28:36.948 --> 28:38.249
(laughter) So...

28:38.316 --> 28:40.118
{\an5}Oh, no.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.118
{\an3}Hold on.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.753
This somebody
would like--

28:41.820 --> 28:44.422
{\an5}They would,
like, wrap it
around themselves,

28:44.489 --> 28:46.925
and then they would
take the Safaree mold

28:46.991 --> 28:50.328
and...boom, lock it on,

28:50.395 --> 28:52.263
and they would be like
pretending to be me.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.232
{\an1}Yes, sir.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.968
That's crazy that people
would really be home

28:57.035 --> 28:58.736
and be like--
pretending to be me.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.605
{\an1}I mean, there are customers
who haven't bought

29:00.672 --> 29:02.540
{\an1}a harness yet who are
waiting for your product.

29:02.607 --> 29:05.443
{\an1}But we sell over
5,000 harnesses a month.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.846
Look, I'm Safaree.
My name is rare.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.347
Everything
about me is rare.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.949
I don't know
if it would feel right

29:11.015 --> 29:15.086
{\an5}for there to be
a $99 version of me
in everybody's home.

29:15.153 --> 29:18.423
{\an5}And Pap's right.
How would my future wife
feel about this, huh?

29:18.490 --> 29:21.092
{\an5}I'm supposed to be doing
this mold in the next
couple of days,

feel like I got myself

29:23.728 --> 29:27.565

to pull back from.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.925
Oh, my God, be careful!
Aah!

29:53.992 --> 29:56.227

{\an8}As much I love having
Infinity at my house,

30:00.732 --> 30:04.536
{\an8}it turns out that it is more
complicated than I thought.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.070
Jonathan was right.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.072
I am super stressed
about everything,

30:08.139 --> 30:09.440
and I just need
to clear my mind

30:09.507 --> 30:11.242
and get some girl time.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.112
So, I need to
tell you guys something.

30:14.179 --> 30:17.749
{\an4}So, you know I have
the EGL mentorship program?

30:14.179 --> 30:17.749
{\an1}Yeah.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.817
So one of the girls
in my program,

30:19.884 --> 30:21.920
she's in the foster
care system.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.388
She's having
some issues there,

30:23.454 --> 30:25.390
and she had
nowhere to go.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.724
I brought her
to my house.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.059
She said, "I'm not
going back there.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.160
{\an5}She said,
"I'll sleep
in the street

30:29.227 --> 30:31.029
before I do that."

30:31.095 --> 30:33.231
{\an5}So, do you want--
You want to take her
into your house?

30:33.298 --> 30:36.734
{\an5}I cannot send
this baby girl
somewhere unsafe.

30:36.801 --> 30:39.103
{\an4}What's the steps, though?
Like, what's the process...

30:36.801 --> 30:39.103
That's the thing.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.039
{\an4}of getting her to be able
to stay with you?

30:39.170 --> 30:41.039
{\an3}I've been--

30:41.105 --> 30:44.008
{\an5}I have no idea.
The case worker
is saying

30:44.075 --> 30:46.811
if I don't go through
the proper procedures

30:46.878 --> 30:50.848
{\an5}the system could come
and take my kids.

30:46.878 --> 30:50.848
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.584
So, I gotta take her back.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.485
{\an1}No, Yandy.

30:54.552 --> 30:57.789
Basically, tonight
I have to tell her, like,

30:57.855 --> 31:01.059
{\an5}(voice breaking)
that I have to take her
to a group home

31:01.125 --> 31:03.661
or back to her
foster care.

31:03.728 --> 31:06.431
From what she told me, I have
to protect this girl.

31:06.497 --> 31:10.702
But if it it not legal,
I cannot risk it.

31:10.768 --> 31:12.904
You know I was in the system,
and the same age,

31:12.971 --> 31:15.673
and a few point
in times, you know,

31:15.740 --> 31:18.343
some of my friends'
mothers took me in.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.278
{\an5}But were you able
to stay there while
they worked it out?

31:20.345 --> 31:21.713
No, I ran away.

31:21.779 --> 31:23.881
I went and found somebody
else to stay with.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.883
I didn't go to school.
It was bad.

31:25.950 --> 31:29.387
I ended up in foster care
from the ages of 14 to 17

31:29.454 --> 31:32.523
after my mother passed,
and it was awful.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.093
I remember feeling like
nobody cared about me,

31:35.159 --> 31:37.862
so I'm guessing that's exactly
how Infinity was feeling

31:37.929 --> 31:39.764
before Yandy came
to get her.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.667
But unfortunately, they're
up against a system

31:42.734 --> 31:45.470
with a lot of paperwork,
a lot of red tape,

31:45.536 --> 31:48.706

work out in the child's
best interest.

I'm supposed to do
