15:01.458 --> 15:03.083
- Tommy, let me talk to her.
- For a sec?

15:03.086 --> 15:04.250
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.417
- Come talk to me for one second.
- What? Rez.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.917
I wanna talk to you for one sec.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.500
- Don't get aggressive.
- Rez, no. Let me say something - to you.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.688
Let the brother

15:09.689 --> 15:10.833
have a little room.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.000
- Just let him have some space.
- Right now,

15:13.042 --> 15:14.667
he's not in a good place.

15:14.708 --> 15:15.875
He's in some denial,

15:15.917 --> 15:17.542
- he's in protective mode.
- Denial.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.750
His wife left him,

15:18.751 --> 15:19.917
he's a f... ing wreck.

15:19.958 --> 15:21.833
Mj is 100 percent right

15:21.875 --> 15:23.250
but yelling louder

15:23.251 --> 15:24.625
isn't gonna make a difference.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.917
So, mj, dial it back

15:26.958 --> 15:29.292
and let Mike come clean

15:29.333 --> 15:30.458
when he's ready.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.917
- And she keeps talking.
- About my relationship

15:31.958 --> 15:33.250
like she knows.

15:33.292 --> 15:34.458
And it's your relationship.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.750
What she's trying to say,

15:35.792 --> 15:36.958
- she's trying to say,
- "I miss you."

15:37.000 --> 15:38.291
Then she should say that.

15:38.292 --> 15:39.292
And you want him to see

15:39.293 --> 15:40.292
it the way you see it...

15:40.293 --> 15:42.208
- And he's not ready. - I didn't realize.
- There was so much denial.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.292
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:43.295 --> 15:44.583
- There's some denial, okay?
- Okay.

15:44.625 --> 15:45.875
- There's a lot.
- Stop pointing it out to him.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.375
- No problem, I didn't.
- You know why?

15:47.417 --> 15:49.624
I may have the wrong approach

15:49.625 --> 15:50.958
but my intention is right.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.146
What's wrong with me

15:52.147 --> 15:53.292
asking Mike what's going on?

15:53.333 --> 15:54.938
Just tell us and maybe we can

15:54.939 --> 15:56.542
help you fix it.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.792
Mj, mj,

15:58.833 --> 16:00.291
are you okay?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.292
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.458
- I'm...
- My heart hurts for you.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.792
- I swear, I don't wanna hurt you.
- I swear to you,

16:03.833 --> 16:04.917
this is the libra in me.

16:04.918 --> 16:05.999
I'm a sensitive guy,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.333
I just don't like being attacked

16:07.375 --> 16:09.167
- because it f... ing hurts.
- My feelings...

16:09.170 --> 16:10.500
- And it makes me feel...
- Mike, I'm really,

16:10.503 --> 16:11.833
- really sorry.
- Okay.

16:11.836 --> 16:13.499
I learned today

16:13.500 --> 16:14.834
that I need to learn

16:14.835 --> 16:16.167
how to talk to you.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.750
I guess that when I think

16:17.792 --> 16:20.000
- that you're going through.
- Whatever you're going through

16:20.003 --> 16:21.333
that, like, all I think about

16:21.375 --> 16:22.521
is like, Jessica wants you,

16:22.522 --> 16:23.666
loves you,

16:23.667 --> 16:26.167
- all you have to do is figure out.
- A way to make it work

16:26.208 --> 16:27.808
- and then everything.
- Is gonna be good.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.000
You go right

16:29.001 --> 16:30.167
to the f... ing jugular.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.167
- Okay. - Because you're always.
- Reprimanding me.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.833
- I'm like, dude,
- just be my friend.

16:33.836 --> 16:35.500
- Okay.
- Lift me up.

16:35.503 --> 16:37.666
Mj is by far my hardest critic

16:37.667 --> 16:39.000
- and I get she's coming.
- From a good place

16:39.042 --> 16:40.105
and she cares about me

16:40.106 --> 16:41.167
and she wants to help,

16:41.208 --> 16:42.438
but yo, I got this,

16:42.439 --> 16:43.666
I'm an adult.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.167
- We're cool. I just you know, - have to address...
- Okay.

16:45.168 --> 16:46.750
- This sh... - I am learning how to speak.
- To you

16:46.792 --> 16:48.375
- and I do think.
- That that's important

16:48.378 --> 16:49.792
- and I do get it.
- Yeah, absolutely.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.375
- Give me a hug.
- Don't be upset,

16:51.417 --> 16:52.500
I don't want you crying.

16:52.542 --> 16:53.667
I appreciate her apology

16:53.708 --> 16:55.208
- but I would appreciate.
- A lot more

16:55.211 --> 16:57.167
- if she would just back.
- The f... up

16:57.208 --> 16:58.208
and let me come to her

16:58.209 --> 16:59.333
if I need her advice.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.167
- And I think that's the way.
- It should be between us

17:01.208 --> 17:02.750
from this point forward.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.500
- Bye, baba.
- Love you, too.

17:06.542 --> 17:07.707
Have a safe ride back.

[Speaking farsi]

17:09.167 --> 17:10.667
I love you. Thank you.

17:10.668 --> 17:12.167
Big-time.

17:12.208 --> 17:15.792
It is very, very empowering

17:15.833 --> 17:18.042
to be married to someone

17:18.083 --> 17:21.708
because you feel this strength.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.875
I love you.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.000
I love you too.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.375
And I have the man

17:25.417 --> 17:27.208
that I've always wanted

17:27.250 --> 17:28.500
and sometimes,

17:28.501 --> 17:29.750
I didn't even know

17:29.792 --> 17:31.250
that I wanted.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.584
Getting married has given me

17:35.585 --> 17:37.250
the push

17:37.292 --> 17:39.042
to deal with other passions

17:39.083 --> 17:40.167
that I have.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.333
And we're gonna go home

17:41.375 --> 17:43.125
and the real

17:43.126 --> 17:44.875
beautiful part starts.

17:46.292 --> 17:47.875

- I don't think you know

17:47.917 --> 17:49.416
how crazy you are.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.167
- Do you wanna be.

What are we doing here, kid?

Let's do it.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.042
You never knew this

18:38.083 --> 18:40.750
but I have a passion for comedy.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.917
I've dreamt of being onstage

18:42.958 --> 18:44.457
for decades.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.625
- So, luenell,
- I have to ask you something.

18:46.628 --> 18:48.083
Okay, go ahead, baby.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.292
- Ask mama whatever.
- You wanna know.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.230
So, I have fancied myself

18:51.231 --> 18:53.167
a comedian

18:53.208 --> 18:54.292
my whole life.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.667
What do you have inside

that says,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
you know what, f... it.

18:58.042 --> 18:59.667
I'm gonna get up on this stage

18:59.708 --> 19:00.832
and I'm gonna do my thing?

19:00.833 --> 19:02.167
I would say first of all,

19:02.208 --> 19:03.396
just make sure

19:03.397 --> 19:04.583
you're not fooling yourself.

That you're not just funny

19:06.500 --> 19:07.917
- to you and your friends,
- you know?

19:07.958 --> 19:09.167
You have to be funny to people

19:09.208 --> 19:10.625
who don't know you.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.667
What would you say, like,

19:11.668 --> 19:13.250
should I do an open mic night?

19:13.292 --> 19:14.750

- at one of those places.
- I wanna hit that sh...

19:18.708 --> 19:19.917
I want feedback,

19:20.018 --> 19:21.225
I want feedback.

19:21.408 --> 19:22.125
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

19:22.267 --> 19:22.609
I'm all about operating

from a place

19:24.292 --> 19:25.917
of passion and power

19:25.958 --> 19:27.666
and not a place of fear.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.917
I threw

19:28.918 --> 19:30.167
a f... ing surprise wedding.

19:30.208 --> 19:31.417
Guess what?

19:31.458 --> 19:32.917
- It would scare the f...
- Out of me

19:32.958 --> 19:34.792
to get onstage and bomb,

19:34.833 --> 19:36.042

19:36.083 --> 19:38.458
Who cares, I'm gonna try it.

19:41.542 --> 19:44.000
to run ideas past me

19:44.042 --> 19:45.584
and I will be your friend

19:45.585 --> 19:47.125
and your mentor.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.375
- And I don't say that to nobody.
- Luenell, you're amazing.

No, I mean, I'm thinking.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.917
- I was really thinking about it.
- So, you're thinking about?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.416
Oh, okay, alright.

20:32.417 --> 20:33.750
Ever since Reza's wedding

20:33.751 --> 20:35.082
in palm Springs,

20:35.083 --> 20:38.250
I think Tommy and I hit

20:38.292 --> 20:40.833
this corner of reality.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.583
- What?
- Nothing.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.500
- We're driving.
- Each other crazy.

20:44.542 --> 20:45.896
This living together thing

20:45.897 --> 20:47.249
is new

20:47.250 --> 20:49.167
and I want to feel

20:49.208 --> 20:51.249
like I'm an adult with an adult

20:51.250 --> 20:52.542
and some of the things

20:52.583 --> 20:54.082
that I take seriously,

20:54.083 --> 20:55.563
he really treats

20:55.564 --> 20:57.042
like it's a joke.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.708
Hi.

20:58.750 --> 20:59.958
- Can I get you something.
- To drink?

20:59.961 --> 21:01.208
Margarita, please,

21:01.250 --> 21:02.292
- with no salt.
- Sure.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.958
- Whatever you recommend.
- Off the cocktail.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.542
- You like bourbon?
- Why not?

21:05.583 --> 21:07.250
- I'll drink anything.
- All right, fine.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.792
I'll be right back.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.291
Yeah, I'll drink anything.

21:10.292 --> 21:11.958
- Well, right now,
- I want you to know

21:12.000 --> 21:14.750
that if everything in my actions

21:14.792 --> 21:15.917
hasn't been showing

21:15.918 --> 21:17.042
that I'm down for you

21:17.083 --> 21:18.875
and I'm in this for life,

21:18.917 --> 21:20.417
like, I want that to happen,

21:20.458 --> 21:22.375
I pray that

21:22.376 --> 21:24.292
you're the real deal.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.458
I would like to make a list

21:25.459 --> 21:26.583
of things

21:26.625 --> 21:28.124
that I'm gonna put on a magnet

21:28.125 --> 21:29.792
- and attach it.
- To the refrigerator

21:29.795 --> 21:30.834
of things you should do

21:30.835 --> 21:31.875
every day.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.417
Take out the trash,

21:33.458 --> 21:34.917
lower the toilet seat

21:34.958 --> 21:36.625
and like, 25 other things.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.083
She stands on a pulpit

21:38.125 --> 21:39.583
- and she tells you.
- That you're doing wrong

21:39.625 --> 21:41.166
but she's not perfect

21:41.167 --> 21:43.333
- and if I sat there and said,
- "alright, now today,

21:43.375 --> 21:44.958
- I'm gonna tell you.
- All the things I see

21:45.000 --> 21:46.332
"that you do wrong,"

21:46.333 --> 21:47.479
trust me, this relationship

21:47.480 --> 21:48.625
wouldn't last 10 minutes.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.499
Margarita without salt.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
Oh yeah.

21:51.501 --> 21:52.501
And Georgia malt.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.833
in any food right now?
- Can I have a straw for the - water? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

21:55.834 --> 21:57.125

21:57.167 --> 21:58.167
- Sure. So what's...
- So, I was just getting...

21:58.170 --> 21:59.333
- She's just...
- What about the chicken

21:59.375 --> 22:00.750
- and waffles?
- I want the wedge salad,

22:00.792 --> 22:01.833
- no matter what.
- Sounds good.

22:01.834 --> 22:02.833

- Thank you, bud.

22:05.503 --> 22:06.792
My pleasure. Cheers.

22:06.833 --> 22:07.999
Listen, I wanna...

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
If it was about leaving

22:09.001 --> 22:10.000
a toilet seat up,

22:10.001 --> 22:11.417
- I would agree.
- But this is something

22:11.458 --> 22:13.499
that we've been arguing about.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.140
- Then anytime we get.
- Into an argument,

22:15.167 --> 22:16.458
the first thing you say

22:16.500 --> 22:17.500
is that we're done,

22:17.501 --> 22:18.501
we're, it's over.

22:18.542 --> 22:19.958
I've been telling you

22:20.000 --> 22:21.541
from day one, stop.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.208
Don't do that, stop.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.374
And you continue,

22:24.375 --> 22:26.167
it's your go-to move.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.542
- That's your trigger.
- Every time we get into

22:27.545 --> 22:28.875
- an argument.
- That's your trigger.

22:28.917 --> 22:30.292
Okay, so you would figure

22:30.333 --> 22:32.333
you would stop pulling it.

22:32.375 --> 22:33.541
But she could really, really

22:33.542 --> 22:35.207
make me feel like dog sh...

22:35.208 --> 22:37.042
- Because she'll just continue.
- To pick on me.

22:37.045 --> 22:39.458
She's just super duper critical.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.874
You don't let things go.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.208
You've gotta l.I.G. Some sh...,

22:42.250 --> 22:43.542
just let it go.

22:43.583 --> 22:44.833
Alright, here you go.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.125
And this is giant wedge salad.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.208
- Ay yay yay.
- Grazie.

22:47.211 --> 22:48.292
I don't think you know

22:48.333 --> 22:50.458
how crazy you are.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.707
I should get like,

22:51.708 --> 22:53.458

22:53.500 --> 22:54.875
- because you're...
- Too much is at stake.

22:54.878 --> 22:56.042
Because of the...

22:56.043 --> 22:57.207
I am 41.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.667
I am taking a huge risk.

22:59.708 --> 23:01.542
- Do you wanna be.
- In a relationship?

What are we doing here, kid?

23:04.250 --> 23:05.750
Alright.

23:05.792 --> 23:07.083
Do you feel like we should go

23:07.125 --> 23:09.416
to Dr. Michelle or no?

23:09.417 --> 23:10.582
You know, I... listen,

23:10.583 --> 23:11.875
I need a good ref.

23:11.917 --> 23:13.875
- The reason I wanna go.
- To therapy with Tommy

23:13.917 --> 23:16.082
is because what I have with him

23:16.083 --> 23:17.500
is so valuable to me

23:17.542 --> 23:19.250
that I don't wanna screw it up.

23:19.292 --> 23:21.917
That's how nuts you are.

24:09.958 --> 24:11.708
- This is awesome.
- Perfect girl?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.750
Until you talked.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.083
- You know,
- I'm getting to know her

24:15.125 --> 24:16.457
and I like her, she's cool.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.958
- Part of game is not.
- Letting them know you have game.

24:18.961 --> 24:20.292
When you wake up in the morning

24:20.333 --> 24:21.417

- do you go like,

24:21.458 --> 24:22.542
"cheerio, governor?"

24:22.583 --> 24:25.250
That's a different country.

24:25.292 --> 24:26.832
Come on,

24:26.833 --> 24:28.625
I don't do bad on dates.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.750

24:40.542 --> 24:42.105
Thank you so much.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.667
Of course.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.458
I read this article

24:45.500 --> 24:47.166
and it said that over 60 percent

24:47.167 --> 24:48.417
of the recent divorces

24:48.458 --> 24:49.625
in the past year

24:49.667 --> 24:51.458
- have mentioned.
- The term "Facebook"

24:51.500 --> 24:53.583
in the fight.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.709
You know, man,

24:54.710 --> 24:55.792
technology is like that.

24:55.833 --> 24:57.167
- On one side, it helps you.
- It's amazing.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.292
- On the other side,
- it kicks you.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.333
- Kills you.
- You know what, today,

24:59.336 --> 25:00.666
I was looking at the picture,

25:00.667 --> 25:02.166
like, we were together in it

25:02.167 --> 25:03.832
where you weren't tagged, right?

25:03.833 --> 25:05.167
- I came to tag it.
- And it was like,

25:05.168 --> 25:06.168
"user not found."

25:06.208 --> 25:07.250
I'm like, dude,

25:07.251 --> 25:08.292
did you deactivate it?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.667
Yeah.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.625
- I took down.
- My instagram, Facebook,

25:11.667 --> 25:13.500
- Twitter, periscope,
- and snapchat.

25:13.542 --> 25:14.958
So, I don't even exist

25:15.000 --> 25:16.792
- in the world.
- Of the Internet anymore.

25:16.833 --> 25:18.208
I just got tired of it, dude.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.833
I love looking, I'm a man.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.707
It's like porn, instagram.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.208
And my poor wife

25:24.250 --> 25:25.958
has to deal with that sh...

25:26.000 --> 25:28.208
Social media is like cancer

25:28.250 --> 25:29.707
in a relationship.

25:29.708 --> 25:30.792
God forbid you go and like

25:30.793 --> 25:31.874
somebody else's picture.

25:31.875 --> 25:32.917
Oh my goodness,

25:32.918 --> 25:33.958
you're an ass...,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.500
- how could you like.
- That person's picture?

25:35.542 --> 25:37.458
- I'm like,
- "I just liked the picture,

25:37.500 --> 25:39.667
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking."

25:39.708 --> 25:41.000
I had an epiphany

25:41.042 --> 25:42.208
- and that's when I was like,
- you know what,

25:42.211 --> 25:43.875
- I'm gonna show how much.
- I love and respect her.

25:43.878 --> 25:45.375
- You're gonna shake.
- Your social media.

25:45.417 --> 25:46.958
Shake my social media,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.792
that's it.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.416
It's just me and you.

25:50.417 --> 25:51.916
And my feeling for you.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.249
Mike and Jessica breaking up

25:53.250 --> 25:54.708
is not an option for Mike.

25:54.750 --> 25:55.896
He would be very embarrassed

25:55.897 --> 25:57.042
if that happened

25:57.083 --> 25:58.417
and even more so in the persian

25:58.458 --> 25:59.582
and Jewish community.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.333
- Not only is Mike.
- Gonna be embarrassed,

26:01.375 --> 26:03.042
his brothers, his mother,

26:03.083 --> 26:05.417
his father, the rabbi.

26:05.458 --> 26:07.083
- Everybody's gonna have.
- A problem with this.

26:07.086 --> 26:08.750
- A lot of realizations.
- Came to me

26:08.753 --> 26:11.042
where I'm not this f... ing stud

26:11.083 --> 26:12.583
- who can do whatever.
- The f... he wants.

26:12.625 --> 26:14.042
True meaning of compromise.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.000
Oh, true meaning

26:16.001 --> 26:17.917
of the fear of loss.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.416
Although Jessica's moved out,

26:19.417 --> 26:20.708
we still do hang out.

26:20.750 --> 26:21.917
We have decided,

26:21.958 --> 26:23.249
let's date each other again

26:23.250 --> 26:24.667
she wants me to court her.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.042
- Now you have the opportunity,
- do it right.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.833
Yeah, I have to.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.750
- You know,
- it's one conversation at a time,

26:29.753 --> 26:31.021
one date at a time

26:31.022 --> 26:32.291
and eventually,

26:32.292 --> 26:33.750
hopefully...

26:33.792 --> 26:34.855
Things will just fall

26:34.856 --> 26:35.917
into place again.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.583
Coming up...

26:39.625 --> 26:41.457

That motherf... er was no good.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.582
And so, one day, my mom decides,

37:26.583 --> 37:28.042
"you know what, before I call"

37:28.083 --> 37:29.416
this marriage quits,

37:29.417 --> 37:31.542
"I'm gonna go find his mom."

37:34.042 --> 37:35.500
It hurts to watch.

37:35.542 --> 37:37.250
It just hurts my body.

37:37.292 --> 37:39.457
Mm mm mm mm mm mm.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.957
It hurts my ears,

37:40.958 --> 37:42.583
it hurts my eyes.

37:42.625 --> 37:44.624
So, y'all are definitely

37:44.625 --> 37:46.958
an ethnically diverse group,

37:47.000 --> 37:48.458
right?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.083
Where are y'all from?

37:50.125 --> 37:51.167
Any foreign

37:51.168 --> 37:52.208
motherf... ers in here?

37:53.958 --> 37:56.042
Crickets?

37:56.083 --> 37:57.083
None of you guys

37:57.125 --> 37:58.792
ever had a green card?

37:58.833 --> 38:01.542
Can no one attest to this sh...?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.625
Hold on, let me find it.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.124
Where the f... is it?

38:05.125 --> 38:06.291
Oh, here it is.

38:06.292 --> 38:07.667
Ain't nothing green

38:07.668 --> 38:09.042
about the motherf... er.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.959
Reza's going down

38:12.960 --> 38:14.292
in a Blaze of glory.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.208
- So, you guys,
- I'm gonna wind it down

38:16.250 --> 38:17.708
with a little story.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.208
You know, I'm from Beverly hills

38:19.250 --> 38:21.000
- and if you know anything.
- About Beverly hills,

38:21.042 --> 38:22.833
you know persians run that sh...

38:22.875 --> 38:25.083
I got the top down in my car,

38:25.125 --> 38:27.332
I look over to my right

38:27.333 --> 38:28.417
and it's that f... ing bitch

38:28.418 --> 38:29.500
in the Honda.

38:29.542 --> 38:30.917
And the bitch is Chinese,

38:30.958 --> 38:32.563
so I'm thinking bitch

38:32.564 --> 38:34.166
can't even see me.

38:34.167 --> 38:36.958
Ahh, oh no you did not.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.292
- Thank you for coming.
- To my show.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.250
You guys didn't deserve

38:40.251 --> 38:42.166
my comedy.

38:42.167 --> 38:43.459
Did you have fun?

38:43.460 --> 38:44.750
I had a blast.

38:44.792 --> 38:46.500
- Let's hear it.
- For Reza right there.

38:46.542 --> 38:48.292
Tonight was a hot mess.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.750
I don't really give a f...,

38:49.792 --> 38:51.166
I'm actually proud

38:51.167 --> 38:52.332
that I did it.

38:52.333 --> 38:53.999
That was a whack-ass crowd.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.333
Just for the fact

38:55.375 --> 38:57.792
that I was able to get onstage,

38:57.833 --> 38:59.292
do a set,

38:59.333 --> 39:01.750
and not die of embarrassment,

39:01.792 --> 39:03.667
that's cause for celebration.

39:03.708 --> 39:05.625
So, let's get f... ing drunk.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.125
You guys, we have drinks

39:07.167 --> 39:08.292
in the green room.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.000
I'm not gonna let this

39:10.042 --> 39:11.375
discourage me

39:11.417 --> 39:12.874
from trying again.

39:12.875 --> 39:15.041
I wanna do this well.

39:15.042 --> 39:18.542
Oh my god.

39:18.583 --> 39:20.375
Reza's persian balls

39:20.417 --> 39:22.041
have been officially inducted

39:22.042 --> 39:23.292
into the hall of fame

39:23.333 --> 39:24.438
for having the courage

39:24.439 --> 39:25.542
to stand up

39:25.583 --> 39:26.792
and do comedy.

39:26.833 --> 39:27.854
It's not always gonna be

39:27.855 --> 39:28.874
a slam dunk.

39:28.875 --> 39:31.000
Oh.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.541
Coming up...

39:36.542 --> 39:37.707
When two people

39:37.708 --> 39:39.292
are so full of emotions

39:39.333 --> 39:41.000
- and anger.
- And resentment and love,

39:41.042 --> 39:42.542
you don't know what to think.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.417
I hate you.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.042
Oh.

39:54.083 --> 39:55.249
When you get fake boobs,

39:55.250 --> 39:56.583
they kind of like, belong

39:56.625 --> 39:58.208
to like, everybody.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.417
- They look great.
- Oh my god.

39:59.420 --> 40:00.500
It's really nice.

40:00.501 --> 40:01.582
Oh, they look awesome.

40:01.583 --> 40:03.250
I mean, they look great.

40:03.292 --> 40:04.833
Tito's and soda.

40:04.875 --> 40:05.896
Double.

40:05.897 --> 40:06.916
But a lot of tito's.

40:06.917 --> 40:08.542
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

40:08.583 --> 40:10.375
- So, I became obsessed.
- With doing

40:10.417 --> 40:11.417
portraits of couples.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.208
- I've had this idea.
- For my next project

40:13.250 --> 40:14.917
about shooting couples

40:14.958 --> 40:16.875
and celebrating being together.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.167
So, while I know

40:18.168 --> 40:19.417
that Jessica and Mike

40:19.458 --> 40:20.667
are working through stuff,

40:20.708 --> 40:22.667
- I do definitely.
- Want it in there.

40:22.708 --> 40:24.668
- And I really wanna take.
- A picture of you guys.

40:24.708 --> 40:25.750
Alright, do you feel

40:25.751 --> 40:26.791
okay to do that

40:26.792 --> 40:28.125
- at any time.
- In the future or...?

40:28.128 --> 40:29.542
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really?

40:29.583 --> 40:31.375
That's part of being together

40:31.417 --> 40:32.438
and I'm actually feeling

40:32.439 --> 40:33.457
really inspired here.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.957
Remember the couples portrait

40:34.958 --> 40:36.417
- I was asking you about?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:36.458 --> 40:38.250
- And I am so excited.
- I asked her and Jessica is down,

40:38.292 --> 40:39.625
- so I'm really happy. I would.
- Love to shoot you guys...

40:39.628 --> 40:41.625
- The whole night.
- Is just vibing perfectly.

40:41.628 --> 40:43.625
- Like, we've put our differences.
- Aside for the night

40:43.667 --> 40:45.208
- and are just enjoying each.
- Other's company

40:45.250 --> 40:46.791
and it feels great.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.458
Thank you. Come on, guys.

40:48.500 --> 40:51.042
[All cheering]

40:52.958 --> 40:54.625
- Oh.
- Oh yeah.

40:54.628 --> 40:55.957
[Inaudible]

40:55.958 --> 40:57.708
- Thank you.
- Let's go, you guys.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.583
- The escalade's.
- Going to the club.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.124
I got my girl back.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.792
We're having a great time.

41:02.833 --> 41:04.083
Deep down inside me,

41:04.125 --> 41:08.333
I don't want this to end, ever.

41:08.375 --> 41:09.688
Mikey, your wife

41:09.689 --> 41:10.999
just hit me in the nuts.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.999
Your wife [Inaudible].

41:13.000 --> 41:14.833
Mike, what's wrong?

41:14.875 --> 41:17.417
This weird behavior

41:17.458 --> 41:19.166
of men or boys

41:19.167 --> 41:20.666
touching each other,

41:20.667 --> 41:21.958
I don't understand it.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.458
- Why do they keep touching.
- Each other's balls?

41:23.500 --> 41:24.917
- They like each other's balls.
- You guys,

41:24.958 --> 41:26.499
get the f... in the car.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.958
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.792
[Inaudible] F... ing...

41:29.833 --> 41:33.666
[Music playing]

41:33.667 --> 41:35.167
- F... the bitch.
- [Inaudible]

41:35.170 --> 41:37.083
- Left.
- Go left.

41:38.708 --> 41:40.292
Oh my god.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.125
Do you really wanna go here?

41:47.375 --> 41:49.333
The crew, where's the crew?

41:49.375 --> 41:52.333
[Music playing]

41:58.417 --> 42:01.875
It is f... ing insanity

42:01.917 --> 42:03.042
and that's what happens

42:03.083 --> 42:04.541
when two people

42:04.542 --> 42:06.292
are so full of emotions

42:06.333 --> 42:08.167
- and anger and resentment.
- And love,

42:08.208 --> 42:09.874
all intertwined into one.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.458
You don't know what to think.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.625
I hate you.

42:16.042 --> 42:18.333
I don't blame you.

42:20.708 --> 42:21.874
Let's bone in the car.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.333
Sure.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.333
- Let's go, let's go,
- let's go, let's go.

42:25.375 --> 42:26.833
Is that us right there?

42:26.875 --> 42:28.958
Alright, we out.

42:33.917 --> 42:35.750
Hurry up.

42:38.583 --> 42:40.542
Next on shahs of sunset...

42:40.583 --> 42:42.083
- She just yells at me too much.
- Oh my god.

42:42.086 --> 42:43.833
- Yeah.
- I need you to understand

42:43.875 --> 42:45.667
that it's not okay to laugh

42:45.708 --> 42:47.082
everything off.

42:47.083 --> 42:48.582
I told him what I needed

42:48.583 --> 42:51.082
and he was like, "I'm done."

42:51.083 --> 42:53.082
I think that golnesa

42:53.083 --> 42:55.916
is lying about having r.A.

42:55.917 --> 42:57.416
This is f... ing ridiculous.

42:57.417 --> 42:59.042
- You guys, you guys,
- that shouldn't be there.

42:59.083 --> 43:00.708
- Yeah.
- We have a fashion show

43:00.750 --> 43:02.583
- that has 40 million.
- Moving parts.

43:02.625 --> 43:04.083
- Beautiful.
- So you don't need to know

43:04.086 --> 43:05.583
everything I'm doing.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.249
F... ing bitch.

43:07.250 --> 43:08.667
- I suggest,
- unless you want me to out

43:08.708 --> 43:10.083
- the f... out of you, you never.
- You're horrible,

43:10.086 --> 43:11.583
- f... ing call me.
- Those names again.

43:11.586 --> 43:12.958
- Because I will out you.
- Right now.
