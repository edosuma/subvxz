WEBVTT

00:12.882 --> 00:16.494
WOMAN: SORRY. I COULDN'T
FIND A PARKING SPACE.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.813
IS EVERYTHING OK?

00:30.856 --> 00:33.033
I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING
ELSE IF YOU'D LIKE.

00:33.076 --> 00:36.079
NO. THANK YOU.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.776
OF COURSE.

00:37.820 --> 00:40.040
EXCUSE ME.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.441
- HERE YOU GO.
- GRACIAS.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.633
YOU GUYS, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN REID.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.113
HE SHOT A 100.

01:10.157 --> 01:13.508
YEAH, HE QUALIFIED
TO SHOOT A POSSIBLE.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.510
THAT'S A PERFECT SCORE.
WHAT, LIKE 200 AGENTS

01:15.553 --> 01:16.772
HAVE MADE THE WALL
OF GLORY.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.643
HE HIT EVERYTHING.
I MEAN, AT ONE POINT

01:18.687 --> 01:20.906
I THOUGHT HE MUST
HAVE TWO GUNS.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.430
MAYBE I DID.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.996
GARCIA: OK, I THINK
THIS WILL WORK.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.737
WOW, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
HIDING THOSE?

01:25.781 --> 01:28.392
LEWIS: SO, ALVEZ,
WHAT DID YOU SHOOT?

01:28.436 --> 01:29.654
95.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.308
PHEW. TARA?

01:31.352 --> 01:33.745
HUNDRED, COME ON.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.008
NO. NO WAY.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.924
OK. I MEAN, YOU'RE GOOD,
BUT YOU ARE NOT THAT GOOD.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.535
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR
DADDY SAID LAST NIGHT.

01:40.578 --> 01:41.840
OH!

01:41.884 --> 01:43.407
LUCKY DADDY.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.497
GARCIA: I AM LOVING
THIS TIME RIGHT NOW,

01:46.541 --> 01:48.934
BUT TWO DAYS
WITHOUT A CASE,

01:48.978 --> 01:50.545
IT FEELS WEIRD.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.635
IT FEELS LIKE WE COULD
BE DOING SOME OF THIS
WAITING AT HOME.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.463
YEAH, YEAH, ROSSI
STEPPED OUT.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.813
ROSSI'S GETTING
MARRIED IN TWO DAYS,

01:57.856 --> 01:59.336
AND WE'RE ALL STILL
ON THE CLOCK.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.165
SIMMONS:
GUYS, I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS GONNA BE THE HOT SEAT.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.558
JAREAU:
YEAH, YOU DO KNOW
HE'S BEEN BANNED

02:03.601 --> 02:05.429
FROM EVERY CASINO
IN VEGAS, RIGHT?

02:06.822 --> 02:07.866
REALLY?

02:07.910 --> 02:09.172
WITH A DECK OF 52 CARDS,

02:09.216 --> 02:10.913
THE NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS
IS A FACTORIAL OF 52.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.045
YOU SIMPLY NEED TO
CALCULATE YOUR OUTS
AND THEN YOUR IMPLIED ODDS.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.699
MATH IS THE BASIS OF
ALL CARD GAMES.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.179
LEWIS: ALL RIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

02:16.223 --> 02:19.182
TODAY'S GAME'S 5 CARD.
ROLL THEM OUT.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.663
THE BIG BLIND IS 50.
THE BABY IS 25.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.622
WE ARE STILL PLAYING
POKER, RIGHT?

02:57.873 --> 03:00.354
MAN: HE'S GOT A GUN!
RUN!

03:23.420 --> 03:24.813
TCH.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.208
ALVEZ: DO YOU THINK
THE LADY'S BLUFFING?

03:28.251 --> 03:29.992
I KNOW THE LADY'S BLUFFING

03:30.035 --> 03:32.821
BECAUSE SHE HAS A TELL.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.431
NO, I DON'T.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.479
I'M GONNA GO ALL IN.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.741
OH, I LIKE IT.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.700
LIVE BY THE SWORD,
DIE BY THE SWORD.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.920
I CALL.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.878
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE 'EM.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.316
THREE OF A KIND,
KING HIGH.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.014
PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE,
BUT NOT GETTING IT DONE.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.799
PAIR OF KINGS,
PAIR OF 7s.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.453
OH, I'M SORRY,
THREE 7s.

03:56.497 --> 04:00.065
OOH, A FULL BOAT FROM
THE SASSY DR. REID.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.853
LEWIS: OOH!

04:04.896 --> 04:08.422
OH, A STRAIGHT FLUSH!
THAT HAS TO HURT.

04:08.465 --> 04:09.945
GENTLEMEN.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.599
I THINK THAT
REID IS
SPEECHLESS.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.949
GUESS I'M A BETTER LIAR
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.867
THANK YOU FOR NOT
LETTING ME PUT

04:18.910 --> 04:20.956
GARCIA'S OCTOPUS
MUG IN THE PILE.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.870
WHAT'S THAT?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.916
HEH. NOTHING.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.353
OH, BOY, DON'T LOOK NOW.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.746
WE'VE GOT A CASE.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.574
PRENTISS: WE'RE HEADED
TO LOS ANGELES

04:30.618 --> 04:32.663
WHERE TWO MURDERS
IN THE LAST TWO DAYS

04:32.707 --> 04:34.056
WITH THE EXACT SAME M.O.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.492
HAVE THE AUTHORITIES
PUZZLED.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.668
THE FIRST HOMICIDE
WAS YESTERDAY FOLLOWING

04:37.712 --> 04:38.974
A HIT AND RUN
IN EAGLE ROCK.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.889
GARCIA: THIS MAN
IN A PICKUP

04:40.932 --> 04:42.804
REAR ENDED THIS
WOMAN IN A SEDAN,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.458
AND THEN HE GOT OUT OF
HIS CAR AND HE SHOT HER.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.416
PRENTISS: TWICE IN
THE CHEST AT CLOSE RANGE.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.113
HE THEN FLED THE SCENE.

04:48.157 --> 04:51.073
COPS THOUGHT IT WAS
A ROAD RAGE INCIDENT
GONE WRONG UNTIL TODAY.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.293
GARCIA: A FEW HOURS
AGO, A SECOND
SHOOTING HAPPENED

04:53.336 --> 04:55.077
FOLLOWING A VIOLENT
ACCIDENT,

04:55.120 --> 04:56.644
THIS TIME IN RESEDA.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.081
SIMILAR PATTERN,
AND THE SAME DRIVER

04:59.124 --> 05:00.343
ACCORDING TO
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.519
THIS TIME HE'S IN THE SUV.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.653
HE T-BONES THE RED TRUCK.
HE SURVIVES THE CRASH,

05:05.696 --> 05:07.045
AND JUST LIKE BEFORE,

05:07.089 --> 05:09.918
HE GETS OUT,
HE WALKS RIGHT UP
TO THE OTHER CAR

05:09.961 --> 05:11.267
AND SHOOTS THE DRIVER.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.095
ALVEZ: WE'VE SEEN CASES
OF SYMPHOROPHILIA BEFORE,

05:13.138 --> 05:16.446
WHERE A SUSPECT GETS OFF
ON STAGING A CRASH,

05:16.490 --> 05:18.274
BUT NONE THAT
INVOLVED A GUN.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.928
AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT
HE'S ALSO THE DRIVER,

05:19.971 --> 05:22.452
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY
A CASE OF AUTASSASSINOPHILIA.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.889
IT'S AN OVERLAPPING PARAPHILIA
IN WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL

05:24.933 --> 05:26.543
DERIVES AROUSAL
OR SEXUAL PLEASURE

05:26.587 --> 05:28.806
FROM THE THOUGHT OF
AND OR RISK OF BEING KILLED.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.287
SIMMONS: MAKES ME THINK
THE VEHICLES ARE IMPORTANT
TO HIM IN SOME WAY,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.115
LIKE THEY'RE A PART OF WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO DO OR SAY.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.422
WERE ANY OF THE CARS
THE SUSPECT USED
REPORTED STOLEN?

05:35.465 --> 05:38.381
OH, YEAH, BOTH VEHICLES
WERE REPORTED MISSING
PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENTS.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.949
WE'VE GOT
THE MAKINGS OF A
THRILL KILLER HERE.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.125
PRENTISS: A THRILL KILLER
AT THE START OF A SPREE.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.084
WITH TWO DEAD AND OUR
PRIMARY SUSPECT AT LARGE,

05:46.128 --> 05:47.085
THE JET'S STANDING BY.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.044
WHAT ABOUT ROSSI?

05:51.307 --> 05:54.005
I KNOW I SAID I DIDN'T
WANT ANY OF THIS,

05:54.049 --> 05:56.921
BUT I CANNOT WAIT TO
WALK DOWN THAT AISLE

05:56.965 --> 06:00.229
AND MARRY YOU
IN TWO DAYS.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.144
THE ALTAR WILL BE
SET UP HERE.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.842
OK, WHAT ABOUT THE FLOWERS?

06:04.886 --> 06:06.583
THEY'LL BE DELIVERED
MORNING OF.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.847
AND THIS IS THE BAR.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE
ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.023
WHEELS UP.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.982
WOULD YOU GIVE
US A MINUTE?

06:20.554 --> 06:22.077
I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.993
YEAH, YOU DO.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.083
I'LL MAKE IT BACK
IN TIME.

06:28.126 --> 06:31.216
IF I HAVE TO FLY
THE JET MYSELF,

06:31.260 --> 06:34.263
I WILL MAKE IT BACK
FOR OUR WEDDING.

06:34.306 --> 06:37.135
I KNOW YOU WILL.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.746
I LOVE YOU.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.199
MAN: HEY!

06:57.242 --> 06:59.201
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S MY CAR!

06:59.244 --> 07:01.377
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.423
DON'T MAKE ME
SHOOT YOU!

07:03.466 --> 07:04.728
KEYS!

07:52.297 --> 07:54.343
JAREAU: "WE ALL HAVE
A MONSTER WITHIN.

07:54.386 --> 07:57.825
THE DIFFERENCE IS
IN DEGREE, NOT IN KIND."

07:57.868 --> 08:00.088
DOUGLAS PRESTON.

08:00.131 --> 08:03.265
LEWIS: OK, SO OUR FIRST
VICTIM, ANDREA HINOJOSA,

08:03.308 --> 08:04.484
WAS 40 YEARS OLD.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.355
SHE WAS A PUBLIC
DEFENDER FOR L.A. COUNTY

08:06.398 --> 08:08.792
ON HER WAY TO A COURTHOUSE
WHEN THE SHOOTER
COLLIDED WITH HER.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.707
IT SAYS HERE ANDREA
WAS SINGLE, LIVED ALONE.

08:10.751 --> 08:13.493
SHE WAS WELL RESPECTED,
A RISING STAR
IN HER OFFICE.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.539
PRENTISS: WE SHOULD FOCUS
ON DISGRUNTLED CLIENTS,
ANGRY FAMILY MEMBERS.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.889
GARCIA: I'M WORKING ON
GETTING ACCESS TO HER
CLIENT LIST AS WE SPEAK.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.500
SIMMONS: OUR SECOND
VICTIM, PAUL BURKE,

08:20.543 --> 08:21.849
WAS SOMETHING OF
A ROLLING STONE.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.459
HE'S BEEN AN UBER
DRIVER, A HANDYMAN,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.113
AND MOST RECENTLY,
A CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.289
ALVEZ: HE WAS HEADED
TO A JOB SITE

08:27.332 --> 08:29.726
WHEN OUR SHOOTER SMASHED INTO
HIS TRUCK AND THEN SHOT HIM.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.468
THAT WAS THE VIDEO
YOU SENT ME.
YEAH.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.732
GARCIA, DID PAUL BURKE
AND ANDREA HINOJOSA
EVER CROSS PATHS?

08:35.776 --> 08:37.778
GARCIA: YEAH, IT'S
STILL TOO EARLY TO SAY.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.780
ANDREA HAD A LOT OF
CLIENTS AND CASES

08:39.823 --> 08:40.911
THAT TOOK HER ALL
OVER LOS ANGELES.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.000
PAUL DID, TOO, BUT
HIS DIGITAL FOOTPRINT

08:43.044 --> 08:44.567
ISN'T AS STRONG
AS HIS PEERS'.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.309
LUCKY FOR YOU GUYS,
I EAT DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS
FOR BREAKFAST.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.832
I'M RONKIN'
AND TONKIN' ON THIS,

08:48.876 --> 08:49.703
SO IF THERE'S A CONNECTION,
I'LL FIND OUT.

08:49.746 --> 08:50.791
THANKS, PENELOPE.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.880
GARCIA: LOVE YOU.
I MEAN IT.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.012
WELL, THE UNSUB MUST
HAVE BEEN STALKING THEM.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.450
HE KNEW THEIR ROUTINES,
TARGETED BOTH ANDREA AND
PAUL ON THEIR WAY INTO WORK.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.930
YEAH, IT'S INTERESTING.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.976
THESE VICTIMS
LIKELY DIDN'T EVEN
SEE HIM COMING

09:02.019 --> 09:03.760
UNTIL HE SMASHES
INTO THEM.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.415
AND THEN AFTER HE'S DONE SO,
INCAPACITATING THEM,

09:06.458 --> 09:07.895
HE WALKS RIGHT UP
TO THE CAR,

09:07.938 --> 09:10.288
SO, WHAT, THEY CAN
SEE HIM PULL THE TRIGGER?

09:10.332 --> 09:13.857
FIRST HE SCARES THEM,
THEN HE PUNISHES THEM.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.033
A GUY THIS BOLD,
THIS COLD-BLOODED

09:16.077 --> 09:17.948
FEELS LIKE HE'S
OUT FOR REVENGE.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.820
I AGREE. WE'VE GOT
A LOT TO SORT THROUGH.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.213
TARA, MATT, GO TO
THE FIRST CRIME SCENE.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.564
DAVE, LUKE, YOU'LL HEAD
TO THE LATEST CRIME SCENE.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.914
JJ, REID, AND I WILL
SET UP AT THE LOCAL P.D.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.785
AND GO THROUGH THE NUMEROUS
EYEWITNESS STATEMENTS.

09:28.829 --> 09:29.917
IF THIS GUY STICKS
TO THE PATTERN,

09:29.960 --> 09:31.571
HE'LL STRIKE AGAIN TODAY.

09:31.614 --> 09:32.876
WE CAN'T LET HIM.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.668
DETECTIVE MURAD.

09:41.711 --> 09:42.843
I'M UNIT CHIEF
PRENTISS.

09:42.886 --> 09:43.974
THESE ARE AGENTS
JAREAU AND REID.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.846
PLEASURE. NICE TO SEE
YOU BOTH AGAIN.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.891
IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU
ON THE PHONE.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.414
WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF CALLS

09:49.458 --> 09:52.243
OF POSSIBLE EYEWITNESSES,
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW

09:52.287 --> 09:53.767
WHO'S FOR REAL,
WHO'S CRAZY,

09:53.810 --> 09:55.159
AND WHO'S JUST LOOKING
FOR ATTENTION.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.900
WERE THERE ANY ACCOUNTS
THAT STOOD OUT

09:56.944 --> 09:58.989
DUE TO DETAIL OR
SPECIFICITY?

09:59.033 --> 10:01.339
CCTV FOOTAGE HAS BEEN
ON THE NEWS.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.864
A LIBRARIAN IN SILVER LAKE
RECOGNIZED THE SHOOTER.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.258
CLAIMS HE STOLE HIS CAR
AND THREATENED HIM WITH A GUN.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.957
AND THERE'S A WAITRESS
THAT I JUST SPOKE WITH.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.350
SHE'S PRETTY SURE THAT SHE
SERVED THE SHOOTER YESTERDAY.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.656
WE'D LIKE TO TALK
TO BOTH OF THEM.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.310
WELL, XIMENA, THE
WAITRESS, IS STILL HERE.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.355
I'LL GET YOU THE CONTACT
INFO FOR THE LIBRARIAN.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.662
THANK YOU.
REID, JJ, GO TALK
TO XIMENA.

10:19.706 --> 10:23.797
I WILL REROUTE MATT
AND TARA TO THE LIBRARY.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.886
THANK YOU.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.496
SO, WHAT'D HE SAY?

10:27.539 --> 10:30.455
SAYS HE'S HERE EVERY DAY
AND SAW EVERYTHING.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.240
YOU READY FOR THE PART
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE?

10:32.283 --> 10:34.808
SAYS OUR SHOOTER
WAS RELUCTANT.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.331
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.549
ACCORDING TO OUR FRIEND,

10:37.593 --> 10:39.290
THE SUSPECT'S HANDS
WERE SHAKING.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.249
THAT COULD HAVE
BEEN ADRENALINE.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.685
YEAH, IT COULD
HAVE BEEN,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.774
BUT HE SAYS HE
HESITATED BEFORE
HE SHOT HIM.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.820
THE FOOTAGE WE SAW
WAS TOO FAR AWAY

10:46.863 --> 10:48.560
TO PICK UP THAT
KIND OF DETAIL.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.867
WE NEED TO CHECK WITH
THE OTHER EYEWITNESS REPORTS,

10:50.911 --> 10:52.129
SEE IF THEY BACK IT UP.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.740
ALL RIGHT.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.437
AND YOU COULD HAVE
GOT ME ONE.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.961
YOU GOT A WEDDING
COMING UP.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.746
MAN: WE WERE ABOUT
TO CLOSE FOR THE NIGHT

10:59.789 --> 11:00.877
WHEN HE FORCED
HIS WAY INSIDE.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.096
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM
MADE ME NERVOUS.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.837
HIS ENERGY WAS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.926
WAS HE LOOKING
FOR A BOOK, A PERSON?

11:05.969 --> 11:07.710
I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE,

11:07.754 --> 11:09.320
BUT THERE WAS
NO ONE ELSE INSIDE.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.018
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

11:11.061 --> 11:13.063
HE WENT RIGHT TO THESE
STACKS OVER HERE,

11:13.107 --> 11:14.674
THEN TOOK OFF.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.066
I THOUGHT HE WAS
STEALING A BOOK
OR SOMETHING,

11:16.110 --> 11:17.285
SO I CHASED HIM OUT,

11:17.328 --> 11:18.634
SAW HIM BREAK
THE WINDOW OF MY CAR,

11:18.678 --> 11:20.723
THEN HE PULLED A GUN,
TOOK MY KEYS,

11:20.767 --> 11:22.203
AND DROVE AWAY.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.161
DO YOU MIND IF WE TAKE
A LOOK AROUND FOR A MOMENT?

11:24.205 --> 11:26.686
PLEASE. LET ME KNOW IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.339
THANKS.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.993
TYLER GOT LUCKY.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.778
THE UNSUB COULD HAVE
KILLED HIM.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.519
BUT UP UNTIL NOW HE'S
AVOIDED UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE

11:34.563 --> 11:36.173
AND EVERY CAR
HE'S TAKEN WAS EMPTY.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.784
THIS FEELS RECKLESS.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.873
WHAT WAS HE LOOKING FOR
THAT WAS IMPORTANT

11:39.916 --> 11:43.006
ENOUGH FOR HIM
TO RISK EXPOSING
HIMSELF LIKE THIS?

12:00.937 --> 12:02.765
REID: WE'VE GOT
CREDIBLE SIGHTINGS
ALL OVER THE CITY.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.941
I MEAN, THE SHOOTER
HAS NOT EXACTLY
BEEN CAREFUL.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.335
YEAH, PUBLIC PARK,
THE RESTAURANT YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON,

12:07.378 --> 12:09.163
THE LIBRARY. THIS GUY'S
BEEN SEEN COMING AND GOING.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.904
THIS PAINTS
A FAR DIFFERENT PICTURE

12:10.947 --> 12:12.775
THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT WE
WERE WALKING INTO.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.125
BETWEEN THE HESITATION
THAT DAVE AND LUKE FOUND

12:15.169 --> 12:17.214
AND THIS RECKLESS BEHAVIOR,
WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.696
HEY, PENELOPE.
YOU'RE ON SPEAKER.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.220
FAM, OK, I HAVE BEEN
DOING SOME DIGGING,

12:23.264 --> 12:26.093
AND I HAVE DISCOVERED
A RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ARTIFACT

12:26.136 --> 12:28.008
LIKE THE TEETH OF
A BABY RAPTOR.

12:28.051 --> 12:31.141
6 WEEKS AGO, OUR FIRST
VICTIM, ANDREA HINOJOSA,

12:31.185 --> 12:34.797
HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION
WITH OUR SECOND VICTIM,
PAUL BURKE.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.625
IT ONLY LASTED A FEW MOMENTS,

12:36.668 --> 12:38.583
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY
CONNECTION WE HAVE

12:38.627 --> 12:40.063
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIVE
IN THE SAME AREAS,

12:40.107 --> 12:42.457
THEY DON'T FREQUENT
THE SAME CANTINAS,
NOTHING, NADA.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.980
COULD IT BE SOMEONE
ASSOCIATED WITH ONE

12:44.024 --> 12:45.808
OF THE CASES ANDREA
WAS WORKING?

12:45.852 --> 12:48.028
IT COULD, BUT PAUL'S
NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.291
HE'S NOT LISTED IN ANY
COURT FILINGS OR POLICE REPORTS.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.553
WE NEED YOU.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.163
OH. OH, I HEARD THAT.
IS THAT A LEAD?

12:53.207 --> 12:53.990
THANKS, GARCIA.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.123
OK. GODSPEED.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.473
THEY CAN'T SEE ME.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.867
WE'VE LOCATED THE
VEHICLE STOLEN OUTSIDE
THE LIBRARY LAST NIGHT.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.260
RAMPART DIVISION FOUND
IT IN A RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.958
WE'RE KEEPING
OUR DISTANCE.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.004
PRENTISS: ALL RIGHT, DAVE
AND LUKE ARE CLOSEST.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.484
MURAD: AND WE'VE GOT
UNITS IN THE AREA.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.094
HOW DO YOU WANT US
TO HANDLE THIS?

13:11.138 --> 13:12.574
WITH CAUTION.
HE'S ARMED.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.565
HANDS WHERE I CAN
SEE THEM. NOW!

13:47.609 --> 13:49.393
ROSSI: DO NOT MAKE
ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.657
GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE
SLOWLY WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

13:54.529 --> 13:55.878
SLOWLY.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.185
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.012
OFFICER:
STAY RIGHT THERE.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.883
NO, NO.
I HAD TO DO THIS.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.102
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.494
YOU GOT TO LET
ME GO, PLEASE.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.019
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS,
BUT I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.455
YOU DON'T GET IT!

14:07.498 --> 14:09.457
THIS WAS THE LAST ONE.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.458
HE'S GOT A WEAPON.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.199
ALVEZ: KEEP YOUR
HANDS UP!

14:12.242 --> 14:13.635
OK.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.507
I HAD TO DO THIS, OK.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.031
WHAT DON'T WE UNDERSTAND?

14:18.074 --> 14:20.729
MY WIFE, OK.
SHE'S IN DANGER.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.426
HER NAME IS LYNN ZABEL.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.341
SHE'S AT 4600
SPRUCE AVENUE.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.516
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.912
PLEASE, I HAVE TO
DO THIS

14:29.956 --> 14:31.609
OR HE WILL KILL HER.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.394
PLEASE.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.569
NO, DON'T!

14:43.099 --> 14:45.797
LUKE, HE SAID HIS WIFE'S
NAME WAS LYNN ZABEL.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.539
YES. 4600 SPRUCE AVENUE.

14:48.583 --> 14:54.110
EMILY, WE NEED A UNIT
AT 4600 SPRUCE AVENUE
IMMEDIATELY.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.418
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.167
OUR SHOOTER'S NAME
WAS MARK ZABEL,

15:07.210 --> 15:09.169
37 YEARS OLD,
A MUSICIAN.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.519
HE WAS JUST SHOT
DEAD BY THE LAPD.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.091
MAN: CLEAR!

15:18.134 --> 15:20.093
WE'RE CLEAR!

15:32.932 --> 15:34.672
EMILY.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.981
IT'S LYNN ZABEL.
SHE'S DEAD.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.244
BUT SHE'S STILL WARM.
MARK COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.290
WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON?

15:49.818 --> 15:50.819
SIMMONS: OUR SHOOTER KNEW
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.908
MARK KNEW HIS WIFE
WAS IN DANGER.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.693
WELL, HE TOLD DAVE AND
LUKE HE HAD TO DO THIS.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.304
SO LET'S TAKE HIM
AT FACE VALUE.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.567
HE WAS ACTING
UNDER DURESS.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.047
HE WAS COERCED INTO
A KILLING SPREE

16:01.090 --> 16:02.483
IN ORDER TO SAVE
HIS WIFE.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.745
MURDER BY PROXY.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.138
BUT COERCED BY WHOM?

16:05.181 --> 16:06.704
WHO'S PULLING
THE STRINGS?

16:06.748 --> 16:07.967
HOW WOULD THAT EVEN WORK?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.969
WELL, THE UNSUB WOULD
NEED TO GAIN CONTROL.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.884
SO FIRST HE WOULD TAKE
MARK'S WIFE HOSTAGE
AS LEVERAGE,

16:12.928 --> 16:14.538
GIVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.324
DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY
OR I KILL YOUR WIFE.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.891
THEN HE'D HAVE TO
GIVE MARK SOME KIND
OF INSTRUCTIONS.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.633
HIS ORDERS WOULD BE
CLEAR, CONCISE.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.419
VEHICLE, TIME, PLACE.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.116
SIMMONS: THE VICTIMS
HAVE BEEN SELECTED
AHEAD OF TIME,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.205
SO HE'S MOST LIKELY
WORKING OFF OF A LIST.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.034
SO HE CARRIES OUT
TWO KILLS EXACTLY
AS INSTRUCTED,

16:32.078 --> 16:34.863
DESPITE THE RISK,
HIS OWN APPREHENSIONS,

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
BUT WE INTERRUPTED
HIS THIRD.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.345
MARK DIDN'T COMPLETE
HIS MISSION,

16:38.388 --> 16:39.911
SO THE UNSUB
KILLS HIS WIFE.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.088
BUT IN ORDER TO KNOW
THAT, HE MUST HAVE BEEN
WATCHING HIM.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.915
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S
SOME KIND OF GAME.

16:43.959 --> 16:49.704
IT SAYS EVERYTHING
ABOUT WHAT THE UNSUB
FEELS ABOUT MARK,

16:49.747 --> 16:52.359
HOW MUCH HE WANTED
HIM TO SUFFER.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.279
SO THE UNSUB IS
A PROXY KILLER?

16:59.322 --> 17:00.367
PUPPET MASTER,

17:00.410 --> 17:01.977
MOST LIKELY
ORCHESTRATING HIS KILLS

17:02.021 --> 17:03.152
OUT OF A NEED FOR REVENGE.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.067
JAREAU: FORCED INTO
AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION,

17:05.111 --> 17:06.373
MARK HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE--

17:06.416 --> 17:08.853
EITHER KILL OR WATCH
HIS WIFE BE KILLED.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.595
MARK CHOSE THE FORMER,
JUST AS OUR UNSUB
KNEW HE WOULD.

17:11.639 --> 17:14.076
TURNED MARK INTO
A MURDERER FOR
HIS OWN ENJOYMENT.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.773
REID: SENDING MARK
ALL ACROSS THE CITY

17:15.817 --> 17:17.906
TO COLLECT HIS INSTRUCTIONS
AND CARRY OUT HIS KILLS

17:17.949 --> 17:19.386
SPEAKS TO HIS LUST FOR POWER.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.910
PRENTISS: THIS IS A MAN WITH
A FRAGILE YET OUTSIZED EGO.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.304
ONCE HE'S CHALLENGED,
HE WON'T BACK DOWN.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.220
SO HE'S, WHAT,
TRYING TO SETTLE
SOME KIND OF SCORE?

17:27.263 --> 17:29.135
ROSSI: PERHAPS TEACH
HIS VICTIMS A LESSON.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.790
THE VICTIMS OUR UNSUB
TARGETED, ANDREA, MARK,
AND PAUL ARE ALL CONNECTED.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.009
ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.228
SEE YOU, CANDICE.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.056
MURAD: INCLUDING MARK'S
INTENDED THIRD VICTIM.

17:37.099 --> 17:40.581
ROSSI: YEAH. WE ID'd A MAN
NAMED CHARLIE STURGILL.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.583
JAREAU: THEY'VE ALL
CROSSED PATHS WITH THE UNSUB.

17:42.626 --> 17:46.848
FINDING OUT HOW AND WHEN
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY
ANY REMAINING TARGETS.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.856
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

18:13.570 --> 18:15.137
DAVE.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.399
THANKS.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.922
WE'LL MAKE IT.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.535
SO CHARLIE STURGILL'S HERE,

18:21.578 --> 18:23.276
AND WE CAUGHT A BREAK.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.888
TURNS OUT HE WAS INVOLVED
IN A CASE THAT ANDREA
TRIED 8 YEARS AGO.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.499
SO, CHARLIE,
YOU WERE A WITNESS.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.371
YEAH.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.938
AND THIS WOMAN,
ANDREA, WAS THE LAWYER.

18:33.982 --> 18:37.594
HER CLIENT,
THE DEFENDANT, WAS NUTS.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.031
HE THREATENED TO KILL
EVERYONE AFTER THE
VERDICT WAS DELIVERED.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.164
SIMMONS:
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT THE CASE?

18:42.208 --> 18:44.471
IT WAS A HIT AND RUN.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.864
THE DEFENDANT WAS INVOLVED
IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION

18:46.908 --> 18:48.692
IN FRONT OF THE BAR
WHERE I WORKED.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.129
4 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.652
HAD HE BEEN DRINKING?

18:51.695 --> 18:55.699
UM, I REMEMBER
SERVING HIM EARLIER
THAT NIGHT.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.180
HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.834
BUT IT WASN'T?
NO.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.271
HE WAS PLAYING CHICKEN
WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.231
HE CLAIMED TO ONLY HAVE
GOTTEN BEHIND THE WHEEL
ON A DARE,

19:05.274 --> 19:07.885
THAT HIM AND SOME GUY
WERE PLAYING TRUTH OR DARE

19:07.929 --> 19:09.452
TO IMPRESS SOME WOMAN.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.497
WHO WAS THE OTHER GUY?

19:10.540 --> 19:11.672
THEY DIDN'T SAY,

19:11.715 --> 19:12.977
BUT IT WAS
A B.S. EXCUSE.

19:13.021 --> 19:16.111
EVERYONE KNEW IT.
I SAW THE WHOLE THING.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.286
HE DIDN'T LOSE CONTROL.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.983
HE NEVER EVEN
SLOWED DOWN.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.811
THERE WAS A CAR
COMING RIGHT AT HIM,

19:20.855 --> 19:23.336
BUT HE JUST FLOORED IT.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.990
GARCIA: FOUND THE CASE
IN QUESTION.

19:26.034 --> 19:28.036
OUR UNSUB'S NAME IS
CASEY ALLEN PINKNER,

19:28.079 --> 19:29.951
AND HE'S A PIECE OF WORK.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.432
HE SPENT THE MAJORITY
OF HIS MISSPENT YOUTH

19:32.475 --> 19:34.390
IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.524
HE TRIED TO GO THE
STRAIGHT AND NARROW
IN HIS EARLY 20s,

19:37.567 --> 19:40.091
TOOK SOME ODD JOBS,
BUT CASEY HAS A PROBLEM
WITH THE DRINK,

19:40.135 --> 19:42.050
AS WE ALL SAW, AND IT
FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.660
GARCIA, WHERE IS HE NOW?

19:43.704 --> 19:45.184
GARCIA: I CAN TELL YOU
HE WAS SENTENCED TO
10 YEARS IN PRISON.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.099
HE SERVED 8.
HE WAS RELEASED 4 WEEKS AGO.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.014
AND I'LL TRY TO FIND
HIS LAST KNOWNS.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.929
PRENTISS: NOW, CASEY'S
DEFENSE WAS THAT THIS
WHOLE THING

19:51.973 --> 19:54.802
WAS THE RESULT OF
A GAME OF TRUTH OR DARE
GONE WRONG,

19:54.845 --> 19:58.109
AND THAT THIS MYSTERY
MAN IN THE BAR WAS
REALLY AT FAULT.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.981
NOW, WE THINK THAT MAN
WAS MARK ZABEL.

20:00.024 --> 20:03.071
GARCIA: OH, AND I CAN TELL
YOU VIA CREDIT CARD RECEIPT

20:03.114 --> 20:04.725
THAT THAT BAR IN QUESTION
MARK FREQUENTED.

20:04.768 --> 20:05.856
SIMMONS: AT THE TIME OF
CASEY'S TRIAL,

20:05.900 --> 20:07.118
MARK NEVER CAME FORWARD,

20:07.162 --> 20:08.946
SO THE COPS NEVER
PURSUED HIM AS A LEAD.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.644
CASEY'S BEEN PLANNING
THIS FOR A WHILE.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.037
SIMMONS:
WHEN WE QUESTIONED HIM,
CHARLIE RECOGNIZED

20:13.081 --> 20:14.517
PAUL BURKE AS
THE JURY FOREMAN,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.127
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
ANDREA CALLED PAUL,

20:16.171 --> 20:17.781
TO WARN HIM THAT
CASEY WAS OUT.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.740
JURY ROSTERS IN
LOS ANGELES COUNTY
ARE SEALED.

20:19.783 --> 20:20.958
THAT'S WHY WE COULDN'T
FIND THE CONNECTION

20:21.002 --> 20:22.221
BETWEEN
PAUL AND ANDREA.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.224
SO ANDREA
WAS HIS LAWYER,

20:25.267 --> 20:27.138
PAUL THE JURY FOREMAN,

20:27.182 --> 20:29.489
CHARLIE THE EYEWITNESS.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.578
CASEY'S GOING AFTER
EVERYONE INVOLVED,

20:31.621 --> 20:33.841
EVERYONE THAT HELPED
PUT HIM AWAY.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.539
ROSSI: WE NEED THE NAMES
OF EVERYONE WHO COULD HAVE
BEEN IN THAT COURTROOM.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.672
COMPILING AND SENDING NOW.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.893
HEY, SWEETIE,
WHAT'S UP?

20:42.937 --> 20:45.287
CASEY: IS THIS
THE HONORABLE JUDGE,
MS. MELISSA HAMILTON?

20:45.331 --> 20:46.897
WHO IS THIS?

20:46.941 --> 20:48.856
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.858
I HAVE YOUR
DAUGHTER CANDICE.

20:50.901 --> 20:53.469
I WOULDN'T DO THAT,
MELISSA.

20:53.513 --> 20:57.038
YOU'LL DO EXACTLY
AS I SAY OR SHE DIES.

20:57.081 --> 21:00.476
UM, NEVER MIND.
I THOUGHT I FORGOT A FILE.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.652
I'M GOOD.
THAT'S MY CAR.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.135
CASEY: I'M GONNA BE
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.399
TALK TO THE POLICE,
ASK ANYONE ELSE FOR
ANY HELP,

21:10.443 --> 21:11.966
CANDICE IS DEAD.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.064
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:23.107 --> 21:26.154
WE'RE GONNA PLAY
A LITTLE GAME.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.461
REID: GARCIA, ANY LUCK
WITH JUDGE HAMILTON?

21:28.504 --> 21:31.420
NO. WE'VE REACHED
EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.204
SHE WON'T PICK UP.
I'M PINGING HER PHONE.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.554
YOU GUYS ARE CLOSE.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.251
JAREAU: SHE'S GOT
TO BE HIS END GAME.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.948
HE KNOWS WE'RE
ON TO HIM.
TIME IS LIMITED.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.776
DURING SENTENCING, SHE WANTED
TO THROW THE BOOK AT HIM,

21:39.820 --> 21:41.865
SAID HE NEEDED TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.258
THAT WOULD HAVE
INCENSED HIM.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.651
OH, SHE JUST PULLED OVER.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.393
YOU'LL DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.438
YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT.

21:53.616 --> 21:56.271
REID: THAT'S HER.
THAT'S JUDGE HAMILTON.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.881
TURN AROUND.

21:57.925 --> 22:00.057
GO! NOW!

22:21.122 --> 22:23.733
GO, GO, GO. GO!

22:27.215 --> 22:28.869
RIGHT THERE.

22:29.957 --> 22:30.914
EVERYBODY OUT!

22:31.959 --> 22:33.482
JAREAU: GO! GET OUT!
FBI.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.615
PUT YOUR WEAPONS DOWN. NOW!

22:35.658 --> 22:36.616
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.226
MELISSA, TAKE IT.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.273
TAKE IT!

22:42.317 --> 22:44.885
I'LL KILL YOUR DAUGHTER.
YOU KNOW I WILL.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.888
POINT IT AT THEM.
NOW!

22:51.282 --> 22:53.284
CASEY: I'M NOT GONNA
ASK YOU AGAIN.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.635
PUT IT DOWN!

22:55.678 --> 22:58.246
PUT THEM DOWN NOW!

22:58.289 --> 22:59.378
IT'S OK.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.206
DOWN!

23:04.121 --> 23:05.645
MELISSA, PICK THEM UP.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.386
PICK THEM UP!
GO, GO!

23:07.429 --> 23:09.649
TOSS THEM.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.305
PLEASE, DON'T HURT HER.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.655
I DIDN'T CALL THEM.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.439
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THEY FOUND ME.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.310
DO NOT MOVE.

23:19.354 --> 23:22.488
LOCK IT DOWN!

23:24.968 --> 23:27.406
PLEASE, JUST LET
MY DAUGHTER GO.

23:27.449 --> 23:31.061
MELISSA, WE HAVEN'T
FINISHED OUR LITTLE GAME.

23:42.551 --> 23:45.075
REAR ENTRANCE HAS BEEN
BARRICADED AS WELL.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.121
EYEWITNESSES PUT
4 OR 5 PEOPLE INSIDE.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.992
WHAT ABOUT
SECURITY CAMERAS?

23:49.036 --> 23:50.254
EMPLOYEE SAYS
THEY'RE CHEAP,

23:50.298 --> 23:52.082
ROUTED OFF OF SOME
SERVER IN CHINA.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.606
WE'RE TRYING TO
ACCESS THEM NOW.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.477
GET GARCIA ON IT.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.001
RAPID RESPONSE TEAM IS
GEARING UP IN THE BACK.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.003
AS SOON AS THEY FIND A
POINT OF VULNERABILITY,

24:00.047 --> 24:01.091
I WANT TO GO IN STRONG.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.397
NO. NO, THAT'S
A BAD IDEA.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.834
LET'S BUILD A LINE
OF COMMUNICATION, START THERE.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.532
WE'VE GOT TWO OF OUR
BEST AGENTS IN THERE.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.838
WE NEED TO TRUST THAT THEY'LL
KEEP THINGS UNDER CONTROL

24:08.882 --> 24:11.058
UNTIL WE CAN FIND
A WAY IN.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.451
OK.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.977
THE PROBLEM IS,
CASEY'S NOT LIKELY
TO ASK FOR ANYTHING.

24:17.020 --> 24:20.110
I MEAN, WHAT
HE WANTS, HE HAS.

24:20.154 --> 24:22.548
WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE
WITH A GUY WHO DOESN'T
WANT ANYTHING.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.987
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.075
CASEY: HURRY UP.

24:28.118 --> 24:30.033
GET OVER HERE.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.037
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

24:34.081 --> 24:37.127
I TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

24:37.171 --> 24:39.042
THAT MARK WAS THE ONE
WHO FORCED ME TO DO IT,

24:39.086 --> 24:40.348
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

24:40.391 --> 24:44.526
YOU JUST SAT UP THERE
LOOKING SMUG AND SUPERIOR.

24:44.570 --> 24:48.487
YOU THINK YOU'RE
SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

24:48.530 --> 24:52.142
YOU'RE JUST AS CAPABLE
OF HURTING SOMEONE
AS ANYBODY IS.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.760
WELL, HERE IT IS,
JUDGE...

25:02.196 --> 25:04.067
YOUR MOMENT OF TRUTH.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.419
SHOOT HER,

25:08.463 --> 25:10.073
OR I'LL KILL
YOUR DAUGHTER.

25:10.117 --> 25:13.773
JAREAU: COME ON.
SHE'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS, OK.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.209
JUST LET HER GO.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.471
SHOOT HER!

25:16.515 --> 25:18.952
CASEY.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.693
SHE'S NOT
A PART OF THIS.

25:20.736 --> 25:21.868
OK?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.217
YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO HURT HER.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.698
JUST LET HER GO.

25:40.756 --> 25:43.019
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.077
GET UP! NOW!

26:01.081 --> 26:03.387
DO NOT MOVE!

26:08.088 --> 26:09.524
NEW DEAL.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.573
NOW YOU NEED TO KILL
ONE OF THESE TWO.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.407
TO GET MELISSA
TO PLAY ALONG,

26:23.451 --> 26:25.105
HE'S GOT TO BE
FORCING HER HAND,

26:25.148 --> 26:27.977
AND MY GUESS IS THAT
HE'S USING HER DAUGHTER
CANDICE AS LEVERAGE.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.588
JUST LIKE BEFORE WITH
MARK AND HIS WIFE.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.720
IF HE'S HOLDING HER,
IT'S GOT TO BE CLOSE.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.243
GO DOOR TO DOOR,
CAR TO CAR.

26:33.287 --> 26:36.029
WE REMOVE THE THREAT,
WE CAN TURN MELISSA.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.988
WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

26:39.032 --> 26:40.599
PLEASE.

26:40.642 --> 26:41.861
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.385
FOCUS, MELISSA.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.039
PLEASE.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.432
JUDGE, YOU GOT
TO DECIDE.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.392
THAT'S WHAT
YOU DO, RIGHT?

26:51.435 --> 26:53.916
DECIDE
LIFE OR DEATH

26:53.960 --> 26:55.439
WITH A FLICK
OF YOUR GAVEL.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.280
REID: ANSWER IT.
CASEY, ANSWER IT.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.978
SHUT UP!

27:12.021 --> 27:13.936
PULL THE TRIGGER!

27:16.286 --> 27:18.114
NOTHING.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.942
FOCUS, MELISSA.

27:21.727 --> 27:22.989
PULL THE TRIGGER.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.555
CASEY.

27:24.599 --> 27:28.211
UM, IF MELISSA
WON'T PLAY,

27:28.255 --> 27:30.649
I WILL.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.568
TRUTH OR DARE.
THAT'S YOUR GAME,
RIGHT?

27:40.093 --> 27:41.224
I'LL PLAY.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.839
SIMMONS: I GOT GARCIA.
SHE'S SECONDS AWAY

27:46.882 --> 27:48.144
FROM ACCESSING
THE SECURITY FEED.

27:48.188 --> 27:50.277
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.
WE GOT THE LAPTOP.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.844
I'M RUNNING ALGORITHMS
ON ALGORITHMS HERE.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.150
AND WE ARE IN.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.543
THIS IS LIVE.

27:55.586 --> 27:58.241
OK. ALL RIGHT,
LOOKS LIKE REID
AND JJ ARE TIED UP,

27:58.285 --> 28:00.766
AND IT'S THE SHOP
MANAGER THAT WAS SHOT.
RIGHT? LOOK.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.768
SHE'S STILL MOVING.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.160
SIMMONS:
DO WE HAVE AUDIO?

28:04.204 --> 28:06.206
NO, CAMERAS AREN'T CAPABLE.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.382
IS THAT A DOOR?WHERE?

28:08.425 --> 28:10.166
RIGHT HERE.
FAR LEFT WALL.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.212
CASEY: MELISSA,
THE WEAPON. NOW!

28:12.255 --> 28:14.214
REID: CASEY, I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE,

28:14.257 --> 28:16.216
TO BE WRONGLY ACCUSED,

28:16.259 --> 28:18.653
SENT TO PRISON FOR A
CRIME YOU DIDN'T COMMIT.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.091
YEAH, RIGHT.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.963
YOU WENT TO JAIL?

28:25.225 --> 28:27.270
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT,
PRETTY BOY.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.583
CASEY: OK.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.193
AGENT...

28:37.237 --> 28:39.195
JAREAU.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.721
AGENT JAREAU.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.642
TRUTH OR DARE?

28:51.686 --> 28:53.862
TRUTH.

28:53.906 --> 28:57.344
IF I THINK YOU'RE LYING
OR STRETCHING THE TRUTH

28:57.387 --> 28:59.607
IN THE SLIGHTEST,
I'LL KILL HIM.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.873
YEAH.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.836
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYBODY BEFORE?

29:10.879 --> 29:13.447
YES, I HAVE.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.275
YOU ENJOY IT?

29:15.318 --> 29:17.407
NO.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.980
LIAR!

29:26.895 --> 29:28.462
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT LYING.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.681
OK, I'M NOT LYING.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.858
THE PEOPLE I SHOT
I HAD NO CHOICE,

29:32.901 --> 29:37.253
BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT.
I DIDN'T.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.299
OK, YOU ASKED, AND I
TOLD THE TRUTH, OK.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.214
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

29:41.257 --> 29:44.434
SO NOW IT'S MY TURN.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.785
RIGHT?

29:46.828 --> 29:48.351
THAT'S HOW THIS
GAME'S PLAYED.

29:48.395 --> 29:51.354
WE TAKE TURNS.

29:51.398 --> 29:53.530
TRUTH OR DARE?

29:56.838 --> 29:58.492
TRUTH.

29:59.885 --> 30:00.842
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE
FOR ALL OF US

30:00.886 --> 30:02.365
TO WALK OUT
OF HERE ALIVE,

30:02.409 --> 30:04.063
FOR THIS TO END
PEACEFULLY?

30:04.106 --> 30:05.586
I AIN'T GOING BACK
TO PRISON.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.240
MY TURN.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.459
TRUTH OR DARE?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.332
TRUTH.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.161
I WANT YOU TO SAY SOMETHING
YOU'RE AFRAID TO SAY,

30:15.204 --> 30:16.989
THAT YOU'D NEVER
TELL ANYBODY.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.773
AND YOU BETTER
MAKE IT GOOD,

30:18.817 --> 30:21.645
'CAUSE IF IT'S NOT,
IT'S GONNA BE THE LAST
THING YOU EVER SAY.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.910
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

30:26.172 --> 30:28.348
THERE ARE ONLY 4 PEOPLE
I TRUST IN THIS WORLD.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.610
BORING.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.526
NEXT!

30:34.006 --> 30:35.529
UM...

30:36.617 --> 30:40.403
MY...

30:40.447 --> 30:43.058
MY BABY I LOST,
I, UM...

30:44.407 --> 30:46.322
MMM.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.063
I WANTED TO NAME
HER MAGGIE.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.413
WRONG! COME ON, YOU CAN
DO BETTER THAN THAT.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.501
CASEY.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.939
SHUT UP!

30:53.982 --> 30:56.419
OK, OK, OK.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.552
LAST CHANCE.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.641
SOMETHING YOU WOULD
NEVER SAY ALOUD,

31:00.684 --> 31:03.339
NOT EVEN TO YOUR
PARTNER HERE.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.994
YOUR DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.867
IMPRESS ME
OR I KILL HIM.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.830
COME ON!

31:23.664 --> 31:27.233
SPENCE, UM...

31:30.192 --> 31:32.325
UM...

31:36.982 --> 31:38.679
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.425
AND I WAS JUST TOO SCARED
TO SAY IT BEFORE.

31:47.949 --> 31:51.910
AND NOW THINGS ARE JUST
REALLY TOO COMPLICATED
TO SAY IT NOW.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.481
I'M SORRY.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.138
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

32:07.577 --> 32:09.884
HOT DAMN.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.930
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.671
NOW THOSE ARE SOME
LAST WORDS RIGHT THERE.

HEY, THAT'S MY LINE.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.975
HAVE YOU MET PORTIA?

34:25.019 --> 34:26.716
I HAVE, YES.
SHE'S AMAZING.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.545
TOLD ME HOW YOU STOPPED
HER FROM MARRYING
A TOTAL LOSER,

34:29.589 --> 34:33.332
WHICH SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.899
YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME.

34:39.773 --> 34:40.817
YEAH?

34:40.861 --> 34:42.950
PERFECT.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.995
YOU LOOK PERFECT.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.607
YOU GUYS DECIDED ON
A HONEYMOON YET?

34:47.650 --> 34:50.610
WE HAVEN'T. WE TALKED
ABOUT IT, BUT...

34:50.653 --> 34:55.397
WELL, HOW ABOUT TWO WEEKS
IN THE FRENCH RIVIERA?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.664
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.839
I KNOW.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.972
YOU TALKED ABOUT IT
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.194
OH, MOM, DON'T START.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.674
COME ON,
THE CAR'S WAITING.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.033
HI.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.427
KRISTY: HEY, I WAS HOPING
TO MEET THE FANTASTIC

35:25.471 --> 35:27.647
ANDREW MENDOZA
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.822
YOU WILL.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.911
I JUST THOUGHT
A WEDDING LIKE THIS

35:30.954 --> 35:32.086
MIGHT BE A LITTLE--

35:32.130 --> 35:33.783
TOO SOON?

35:33.827 --> 35:35.133
TOO MUCH.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.787
GARCIA: OK, I HAVE JUST
MADE THIS UP.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.833
I CALL IT THE ROSSI.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.922
IT IS SERVED IN
A CRYSTAL GOBLET.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.619
THAT IS WITH A "C"
AND ONE "L."

35:43.663 --> 35:45.447
IT IS DISTINGUISHED.
IT'S RELIABLE.

35:45.491 --> 35:48.146
IT'S A LITTLE SWEET
WITH JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF BITE.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.799
WILL IT GET ME DRUNK?TOTALLY.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.105
I WILL TAKE A DOUBLE.DONE.

35:51.149 --> 35:55.022
OH, AND, UM, I CAME
TO THIS WEDDING BY MYSELF,

35:55.065 --> 35:56.980
BUT I WILL NOT BE
DANCING BY MYSELF.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.286
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
DR. REID?

35:58.330 --> 35:59.766
- YES.
- OK.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.377
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.075
I WAS WAITING TO SEE
IF LISA WAS GONNA HAVE
TO WORK AN EXTRA SHIFT,

36:05.119 --> 36:09.123
AND SHE DOES, SO MAYBE
SHE'LL MAKE IT LATER.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.299
CAN I PLEASE HAVE ONE
OF YOUR FANCY DRINKS?

36:11.343 --> 36:12.953
BECAUSE YOU ASKED
NICELY, YOU CAN.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.042
OH, MY GOSH, YOU GUYS,
DID YOU GUYS HEAR?

36:15.085 --> 36:18.045
JOHNNY MATHIS IS
ROSSI'S BEST MAN.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.743
OF COURSE HE IS.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.092
LEWIS: I GOTTA GET
SOME FAMOUS FRIENDS.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.311
JOHNNY, I'M TELLING YOU,

36:23.355 --> 36:25.922
SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
GIRL IN THE WORLD.

36:25.966 --> 36:28.403
THEN WHAT IS SHE
DOING WITH YOU?

36:28.447 --> 36:30.144
I HAVE NO IDEA.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.233
BUT YOUR MUSIC HAS
A LOT TO DO WITH IT.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.540
HERE'S TO SECOND CHANCES.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.976
SECOND CHANCES,
MY FRIEND.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.102
PRENTISS: WHEN DAVE
GOT ENGAGED,

37:59.146 --> 38:01.453
HE PULLED OUT
ALL THE STOPS.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.193
SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT
KNOW THIS,

38:03.237 --> 38:07.502
BUT HE PROPOSED
TO KRYSTALL IN OUR
ELEVATOR AT THE FBI,

38:07.546 --> 38:09.809
WHICH WAS PERFECT.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.072
IF SHE SAID NO, HE COULD
JUST GO BACK TO WORK

38:12.115 --> 38:15.075
AND SHE HAD
A BUILT-IN ESCAPE.

38:15.118 --> 38:18.557
BUT SHE SAID YES,
AND HERE WE ARE.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.124
OF COURSE, OUR GOOD FRIEND
DAVID ROSSI

38:21.168 --> 38:23.213
HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE.

38:23.257 --> 38:26.173
THIS ISN'T HIS FIRST
RODEO, AS THEY SAY.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.002
STRANGELY ENOUGH, THOUGH,
HE HAS NEVER BEEN TO
AN ACTUAL RODEO.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.960
BUT I DIGRESS.

38:31.004 --> 38:35.051
PENELOPE SAYS THAT
THIS WAS FATE,

38:35.095 --> 38:37.924
THAT THEIR MARRIAGE
WAS IN THE STARS.

38:37.967 --> 38:41.362
DAVE AND KRYSTALL
ARE TWIN FLAMES,

38:41.406 --> 38:46.062
TWO SOULS THAT ARE
ALWAYS MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

38:46.106 --> 38:48.326
SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME,

38:48.369 --> 38:51.938
SOMETIMES IT TAKES
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE
OR SOMETHING,

38:51.981 --> 38:54.506
BUT THE THING
ABOUT TWIN FLAMES

38:54.549 --> 38:59.119
IS THAT NOTHING CAN
KEEP THEM APART.

38:59.162 --> 39:02.252
THEY ARE A MAGIC
UNTO THEMSELVES.

39:02.296 --> 39:06.169
AND TOGETHER, THEY
LIGHT THE WAY FOR ALL OF US.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.129
TO DAVID AND KRYSTALL.

39:09.172 --> 39:11.261
ALL: TO DAVID AND KRYSTALL.
