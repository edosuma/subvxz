02:01.122 --> 02:02.998
Hello!

02:23.561 --> 02:25.688
Hello!

02:28.858 --> 02:31.527
Hello!

02:38.284 --> 02:40.119
How many jackpots?

02:40.244 --> 02:43.789
So far, 29 mega jackpots.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.292
I'm dead.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.921
Mr. Jackpots!
Mr. Jackpots!

02:51.046 --> 02:53.090
Tell me which one.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.143
Thank you!

03:33.964 --> 03:35.507
Now 30.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.930
Thank you, Mr. Jackpots!

03:41.055 --> 03:43.849
Thank you!
Thank you, Mr. Jackpots.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.101
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.854
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.773
Dougie!

03:50.898 --> 03:52.441
Dougie, is that you?

03:52.566 --> 03:55.402
It's Bill Shaker,
Allied Chemicals.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.863
What, are you taking
a walk on the wild side?

03:59.323 --> 04:01.033
Bill Shaker.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.038
Bill Shaker.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.918
Dougie Jones.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.465
Dougie Jones.

04:16.590 --> 04:21.136
Yes. I'm Bill Shaker,
and you're Dougie Jones.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.017
Man, Dougie, can I say,
you look like a million bucks.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.436
What is it, the diet?
New haircut?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.480
Oh.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.567
I'm sorry.
I'm really hungry.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.987
I haven't eaten
since breakfast at home.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.114
Home.

04:45.119 --> 04:48.372
Sorry.
I don't get it, Dougie.

04:48.497 --> 04:51.083
You want to go home, Dougie?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.418
Is that right?

04:56.422 --> 04:58.382
I think he wants to go home.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.717
Home.

05:01.135 --> 05:03.804
Where is your home?
Is that right?

05:03.929 --> 05:06.598
He knows
where his home is.

05:06.724 --> 05:09.184
Well, where is his home?

05:11.145 --> 05:13.272
Where home?

05:13.397 --> 05:15.774
Oh, my God.
Lancelot Court.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.484
Your house has the red door.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.862
That's how I always find it.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.573
Near Merlin's Market.
It's not far from here.

05:22.698 --> 05:23.866
Far from here.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.367
No, not far from here.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.120
It's maybe a six- or eight-dollar
cab ride.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.872
Cab ride.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.708
Something must have happened,
right, Dougie?

05:32.833 --> 05:35.377
There's a whole line of cabs
right out front.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.963
Are you okay?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.050
Is he okay?

05:41.175 --> 05:44.636
It was good to see you, Dougie!

05:44.762 --> 05:47.473
Gee, I hope he's okay.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.641
I don't think he's okay.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.565
He's here!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.359
He's leaving!

06:01.362 --> 06:03.113
Excuse me? Sir?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.199
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sir? Hi.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.658
Hi.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.535
Can you, uh,
please come with me?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.288
We'll go this way.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.290
Come on.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.881
You weren't going to leave
without your winnings,

07:03.006 --> 07:04.216
were you, sir?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.386
Sir?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.558
Is there anything
we can do to help?

07:14.518 --> 07:16.103
Call for help.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.230
Call who?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.777
Who?

07:25.362 --> 07:28.866
Well, we'd certainly like
to help you.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.870
Would you like a room?
Good meal? A drink?

07:32.995 --> 07:34.788
A little companionship?

07:34.913 --> 07:35.998
On the house.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.000
Think of us as

07:38.125 --> 07:40.169
a home away from home.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.922
Home.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.512
And do you live around here?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.472
Where is your home?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.434
Lancelot Court.
Cab ride.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.020
Oh, no, no, no.
No cabs.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.229
What's your name, sir?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.109
Dougie Jones.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.821
Limo for Mr. Jones.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.490
Smithie, bring a limo
around front, please.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.732
But you have to promise me something.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.744
You'll come back and try
your luck with us again...

08:55.869 --> 08:59.414
soon, anytime...

08:59.539 --> 09:00.999
day or night.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.253
Or night.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.564
That's right.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.692
We're watching you,

09:26.817 --> 09:31.113
Mr....Jones.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.703
We're on Lancelot Court.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.204
You don't know your address?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.248
Just a red door?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.126
Red door.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.585
The thing is, though,

09:45.711 --> 09:48.088
it's hard to see
the color at night.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.896
Red door.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.190
No.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.900
That's black.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.696
Like I was saying,
it‒it's real tough

10:12.821 --> 10:16.408
to see the color
at night, so...

10:21.621 --> 10:22.998
There it is.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.833
There's your door right there,
Mr. Jones.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.195
Mr. Jones?
Mr. Jones?

10:54.571 --> 10:56.156
Mr. Jones.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.848
All right.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.684
All right.
I'll wait right here with you.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.313
Damn.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.232
Those things spook me.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.698
Dougie?

12:19.823 --> 12:21.408
Is that you?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.829
Dougie!

12:32.919 --> 12:34.713
Where have you been?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.090
- What is this?
- Ma'am...

12:37.215 --> 12:38.967
h-he was a guest
at the Silver Mustang,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.720
on his own, and I was asked
to bring him home.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.055
I'll be going now.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.851
Three days without a word?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.644
You don't show up at work,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.480
and you miss
Sonny Jim's birthday.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.398
How could you?

12:56.860 --> 12:58.487
Get inside.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.664
What have you been doing?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.374
Huh?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.168
Why didn't you call me?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.463
Where'd you get
that black suit...

13:16.588 --> 13:18.965
and that haircut, Dougie?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.802
What's in this bag?

13:22.928 --> 13:24.095
Huh?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.520
Dougie?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.105
Dougie.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.150
Dougie, there's...

13:37.275 --> 13:40.028
there's thousands

13:40.153 --> 13:42.280
and thousands
of dollars here.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.416
Where did you get this?

13:55.085 --> 13:58.129
Did you get this
at the Silver Mustang?

13:58.255 --> 14:00.298
Huh?

14:00.423 --> 14:01.550
Dougie!

14:03.510 --> 14:06.012
Don't tell me
you hit the jackpot.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.349
Mr. Jackpots.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.811
You won it?

14:18.483 --> 14:19.317
Dougie?

14:26.616 --> 14:30.245
Well, there's‒there's enough here
to pay them back.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.248
The‒
You could‒

14:33.373 --> 14:35.292
We could...

14:38.420 --> 14:41.798
Oh‒oh...

14:44.426 --> 14:48.680
This is
the most wonderful...

14:48.805 --> 14:51.474
horrible day of my life.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.437
Of my life.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.689
Yes.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.282
I'm gonna fix you
a sandwich,

15:07.407 --> 15:10.493
and then I'm gonna
get you a piece

15:10.619 --> 15:12.495
of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake,

15:12.621 --> 15:15.373
'cause we saved
a piece for you.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.750
Okay?

15:17.626 --> 15:18.835
Oh, Dougie.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.713
I'm so glad
you're home, Dougie.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.388
Home.

15:34.809 --> 15:37.228
The chief of staff will be
with you in a moment.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.521
Where is she?

15:38.647 --> 15:42.192
In a meeting.
She's just finishing up.

15:42.317 --> 15:45.320
Okay, Bill.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.614
- How's Martha?
- Oh, she's fine.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.032
Thank you, Gordon.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.077
She ever fix that thing
with Paul?

15:52.202 --> 15:54.120
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.497
Good of you to remember.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.833
Paul is now
in the North Pole.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.628
Well, there you go.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.921
Please, have a seat.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.131
Thank you, Bill.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.287
Denise.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.789
Gordon.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.916
Thank you for coming in.
What have you got?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.418
It's Cooper.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.294
We found him.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.422
Where?

16:45.547 --> 16:47.507
South Dakota, Denise.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.427
He's in a federal prison
in South Dakota.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.595
We're going out
to see him tomorrow.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.305
I heard.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.307
Yes? How's that?

16:56.433 --> 16:59.394
You're taking
Agent Preston with you?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.396
Yes.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.773
Really, Gordon?

17:03.898 --> 17:06.985
What are you getting at, Denise?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.070
Well, I know
your profile, Gordon.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.823
Beautiful agent,
barely 30.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.576
I'm old-school, Denise.
You know that.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.414
Before you were Denise,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.876
when you were Dennis
and I was your boss,

17:23.001 --> 17:26.671
when I had you working
undercover at the DEA,

17:26.796 --> 17:29.007
you were a confused

17:29.132 --> 17:32.927
and wild thing sometimes.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.222
I had enough dirt on you
to fill the Grand Canyon,

17:36.347 --> 17:38.016
and I never used a spoonful

17:38.141 --> 17:42.187
because you were
and are a great agent.

17:42.312 --> 17:46.775
And when you became Denise,
I told all of your colleagues,

17:46.900 --> 17:51.196
those clown comics,
to fix their hearts or die.

17:51.321 --> 17:54.741
Yes, and as I've said
many times before, Gordon,

17:54.866 --> 17:58.411
I can never repay you enough
for that kindness.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.124
Agent Tammy Preston
has the stuff, Denise.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.752
I know. I know.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.004
I'm speaking more
as a woman now

18:08.129 --> 18:09.964
than as the chief of staff
of the entire

18:10.089 --> 18:13.218
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.094
Don't you just love
sometimes saying

18:15.220 --> 18:17.055
"Federal Bureau of Investigation"

18:17.180 --> 18:19.098
like that all at once?

18:19.224 --> 18:20.809
Unabbreviated?

18:20.934 --> 18:24.312
Oh. It just gives me such a thrill.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.606
It is thrilling, Denise.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.275
And Tammy...

18:29.400 --> 18:31.319
Tammy is so beautiful.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.532
There's room in this
Federal Bureau of Investigation

18:35.657 --> 18:37.492
for more than one
beautiful woman.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.953
Oh, Gordon.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.704
That is so sweet.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.998
You know, normally,
I can't think like this.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.376
I have to forgo all that
and grow balls of steel

18:46.501 --> 18:48.878
to do this job,
and it's‒it's a bitch,

18:49.003 --> 18:50.880
let me tell you, sometimes‒

18:51.005 --> 18:53.258
not to mention
the screaming hormones.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.345
Oh. I know.
I'm sorry, Gordon.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.013
I know.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.267
Gordon, I trust you.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.770
You know that.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.982
And I believe you're on the trail
of something big.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.650
Big.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.862
Will Albert be with you?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.822
Do birds fly?

19:18.283 --> 19:19.576
Good luck.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.703
Ten-four, good buddy.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.962
Thank you, Bill.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.672
Please come along.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.271
Well, it has to do
with the thermostat.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.189
It doesn't actually tell you

19:50.315 --> 19:53.318
what's going on
when no one's here.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.653
Uh, mostly,
we don't have prisoners,

19:55.778 --> 19:57.405
but even if we did,

19:57.530 --> 20:00.199
they couldn't even see
the thermostat.

20:00.325 --> 20:04.495
So I had a man out here recently
to look at the furnace,

20:04.621 --> 20:07.206
and, Sheriff Truman,
he wouldn't answer

20:07.332 --> 20:08.958
any of my questions

20:09.083 --> 20:13.046
about what happens
when no one's here.

20:13.171 --> 20:16.883
We come in early,
and the heat is still on.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.010
What if we came in
even earlier?

20:19.135 --> 20:22.138
Would the heat
still be on then?

20:22.263 --> 20:25.308
Are you next to a loud stream,
Sheriff Truman?

20:25.433 --> 20:27.352
You're breaking up.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.063
Are you still fishing?

20:30.188 --> 20:34.108
Are you next
to a really loud stream?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.486
You're breaking up, Sheriff.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.572
Well, I-I hope
we can get this sorted out

20:39.697 --> 20:41.282
when you get back to the office,

20:41.407 --> 20:45.286
but right now,
it's very comfortable in here.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.414
I have to go, Sheriff Truman,
because there are some people

20:48.539 --> 20:50.750
coming in through the front door.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.344
Lucy. Lucy.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.264
You were on the phone
with her again, weren't you?

21:05.390 --> 21:08.267
Andy, I'm sorry.
We lost the connection.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.937
I couldn't stand
out in the parking lot all night.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.440
I hate cellular phones.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.985
How is this possible?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.570
Lucy, hang up the phone.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.073
But you're in the mountains...

21:22.198 --> 21:23.366
fishing!

21:27.245 --> 21:30.331
Oh, punky.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.833
Punky.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.336
Eleven seventy-one.
Fifteen oh-seven.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.130
Ten-four.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.300
Six ten.
Ten oh-seven.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.969
Copy that.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.679
Oh, hi, Sheriff.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.764
Evening, Maggie.

21:46.889 --> 21:47.974
What's going on tonight?

21:48.099 --> 21:49.267
Kind of quiet.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.353
A domestic, two D&Ds,
and a DUI.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.147
I booked that one.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.233
Dude blew a.250.

21:57.358 --> 22:01.362
Could not even find his nose,
let alone touch it.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.364
Oh, and it was terrible.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.491
A boy OD'd
at the high school‒

22:05.616 --> 22:06.868
Dennis Craig.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.036
Andy took the case.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.996
He spoke with the parents.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.709
Little Denny Craig.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.252
When the bell rang,

22:16.377 --> 22:18.463
he never got up
from his desk.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.382
Where's Hawk?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.009
He's in the conference room.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.348
Gents.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.065
Bobby.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.741
Another apparent OD‒

22:46.866 --> 22:48.659
little Denny Craig,

22:48.785 --> 22:51.662
although I haven't seen
the autopsy report.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.748
I'm guessing it was...

22:53.873 --> 22:57.001
- Chinese designer drugs again.
- Mm-hmm.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.378
Anything on your
surveillance cameras?

22:59.504 --> 23:01.464
Uh, elk, deer,

23:01.589 --> 23:02.965
raccoon, squirrel,

23:03.091 --> 23:04.425
and a bear.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.886
If they're coming down
from Canada in our area,

23:07.011 --> 23:07.970
I would've seen them.

23:08.096 --> 23:11.390
- I got every trail covered.
- Every <i>known</i> trail.

23:11.516 --> 23:12.558
Right.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.685
Frank, I got to take
a leak so bad,

23:14.811 --> 23:16.312
my back teeth are floatin'.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.730
Meet you
in the conference room.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.108
Good deal, sir.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.485
Cell phones...

23:22.610 --> 23:25.696
that means they're
mobile, punky.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.533
The sheriff can be moving.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.827
It's not like your phone.

23:30.952 --> 23:34.664
He can be moving
and even driving

23:34.789 --> 23:36.874
while he's talking.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.129
Lucy...

23:41.254 --> 23:43.089
you're so good at your job

23:43.214 --> 23:46.884
in every other way.

23:47.009 --> 23:51.305
I just don't understand
how this keeps happening...

23:51.430 --> 23:55.101
over and over again.

23:57.812 --> 24:01.732
I don't understand it either, Andy.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.195
You collect yourself.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.616
I've got to go see
Sheriff Truman.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.885
I know she seems
like a strange one,

24:29.010 --> 24:32.471
but her information
has always been spot-on.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.058
So...

24:36.184 --> 24:38.603
Margaret says

24:38.728 --> 24:41.189
that something is missing

24:41.314 --> 24:46.068
having to do with
Special Agent Dale Cooper

24:46.194 --> 24:48.905
and only you can find it...

24:49.030 --> 24:53.159
because of something
about your heritage.

24:53.284 --> 24:55.453
That's what she said.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.666
I'm here, Sheriff Truman.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.671
Good, Andy.

25:11.802 --> 25:15.348
I'm feeling a bit better now,
Sheriff Truman.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.230
I thought
that log woman was 10-96

25:22.355 --> 25:24.315
and not even allowed
in this building.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.485
That's on account
of a kind of gum.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.530
Well, I'll chew on that.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.575
That's enough, Chad.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.623
She gets messages
from her log.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.543
Pinocchio's friend.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.507
Good night, Chad.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.934
I'll go have a word
with my pinecone.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.965
Laura Palmer?

26:42.143 --> 26:44.103
Man...

26:44.228 --> 26:45.313
brings back some memories.

26:53.112 --> 26:53.946
Sorry.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.333
What's all this about?

27:07.251 --> 27:10.838
Message from
Margaret Lanterman to Hawk

27:10.963 --> 27:14.008
concerning Agent Cooper.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.802
Cooper?

27:16.927 --> 27:18.679
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.390
Yeah, I know.

27:21.515 --> 27:24.935
Cooper was the last person
to see my father alive.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.228
What's that?

27:26.354 --> 27:30.149
Yeah.
A few days after my dad died,

27:30.274 --> 27:33.944
my mom told me that Cooper
had come by the house

27:34.070 --> 27:36.238
and talked to my dad,

27:36.364 --> 27:39.241
and I guess Cooper left town

27:39.367 --> 27:40.868
pretty soon after that.
I don't‒

27:40.993 --> 27:43.788
Nobody's seen or heard
of him since.

27:43.913 --> 27:47.541
And my dad died in the fire
at his station the next day.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.044
And do you know
what they talked about?

27:50.169 --> 27:52.421
Uh, no. No.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.090
I have no idea.

28:08.229 --> 28:10.064
There's a man out front.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.234
He says his name
is Wally Brando.

28:13.359 --> 28:16.237
Wally?
Wally's here?

28:16.362 --> 28:17.613
Oh!

28:20.616 --> 28:23.077
Their son.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.330
He said he wants
to pay his respects to you,

28:26.455 --> 28:27.540
Sheriff Truman.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.835
Oh, boy.

28:46.559 --> 28:50.771
Oh! Ooh! Oh.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.943
Sheriff Truman,
look who's here!

28:56.068 --> 29:00.072
It's Wally. We're so excited.
He came in unannounced.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.491
Good to see you again, Wally.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.787
It's good to see you too,
Sheriff Truman.

29:08.205 --> 29:11.000
As you know, your brother,
Harry S. Truman,

29:11.125 --> 29:13.127
is my godfather.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.921
I heard he is ill.

29:17.298 --> 29:21.218
I came to pay my respects
to my godfather

29:21.343 --> 29:24.763
and extend my best wishes
for his recovery,

29:24.889 --> 29:27.433
which I hope will be
swift and painless.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.857
It's an honor
to see you again.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.358
You know...

29:36.484 --> 29:39.695
my heart
is always here with you

29:39.820 --> 29:42.698
and these fine people,
my parents,

29:42.823 --> 29:45.701
who I love so dearly.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.495
And I was in the area,

29:47.620 --> 29:50.122
and I wanted to pay
my respects.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.753
Thank you, Wally.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.856
I also came back
to let my parents know,

30:15.981 --> 30:20.528
because this has been a matter
of grave concern for them,

30:20.653 --> 30:23.781
that I've decided
to let them do what they wish

30:23.906 --> 30:26.325
with my childhood bedroom.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.411
They want to‒

30:29.537 --> 30:31.956
they want to build a study

30:32.081 --> 30:34.124
for the two of them.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.460
Such sweet people.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.671
Oh.

30:38.796 --> 30:41.465
That's such
beautiful news, Wally.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.845
Tell us where
you've been, Wally.

30:50.641 --> 30:54.895
My family, my friend...

30:55.020 --> 30:59.483
I've crisscrossed
this great land of ours

30:59.608 --> 31:01.652
countless times.

31:03.153 --> 31:07.992
I hold the map of it here,
in my heart...

31:08.117 --> 31:10.411
next to the joyful memories

31:10.536 --> 31:13.622
of the carefree days I spent

31:13.747 --> 31:17.126
as a young boy...

31:17.251 --> 31:20.421
here in your beautiful town
of Twin Peaks.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.886
From Alexandria, Virginia,

31:28.012 --> 31:31.473
to Stockton, California,

31:31.599 --> 31:34.101
I think about Lewis

31:34.226 --> 31:37.104
and his friend Clark,

31:37.229 --> 31:40.941
the first Caucasians
to see this part of the world.

31:42.192 --> 31:45.321
Their footsteps have been
the highways and byways

31:45.446 --> 31:48.532
of my days on the road.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.953
My shadow is always with me.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.581
Sometimes ahead.

31:55.706 --> 31:58.626
Sometimes behind.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.837
Sometimes to the left.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.839
Sometimes to the right.

32:06.508 --> 32:10.012
Except on cloudy days...

32:10.137 --> 32:11.805
or at night.

32:18.187 --> 32:19.063
Yes.

32:19.188 --> 32:22.107
Well, Wally...

32:23.734 --> 32:25.611
...it's great to see you again.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.203
And...

32:36.246 --> 32:40.584
...may the road rise up
to meet your wheels.

32:48.509 --> 32:51.178
That's a lovely turn of phrase.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.680
Thank you.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.937
My dharma is the road.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.814
Your dharma...

35:22.412 --> 35:23.330
Dougie!

35:23.455 --> 35:25.499
You're not even dressed!

35:25.624 --> 35:26.959
Is something wrong?

35:27.084 --> 35:27.918
What's go‒

35:28.043 --> 35:29.211
Oh, for God's sake.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.004
What is with you?

35:31.797 --> 35:34.174
Listen, Mr. Dream Weaver,
you go potty,

35:34.299 --> 35:36.885
and then let's
get you dressed fast.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.303
You're worse than Sonny Jim.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.278
Oh!

35:55.612 --> 35:57.322
Oh.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.325
Oh...

36:45.537 --> 36:47.998
Dougie, you've lost weight!

36:50.626 --> 36:52.711
Let me cinch this up.

36:54.254 --> 36:57.591
And this jacket looks
two sizes too big.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.552
That black suit last night
fit you perfectly.

37:00.677 --> 37:03.263
We'll just have to take that
to the cleaners

37:03.388 --> 37:05.766
and maybe get you another one.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.684
Okay. You do your tie.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.603
I can never get that right.

37:12.606 --> 37:15.692
Now, I have to go downstairs
and finish up breakfast.

37:15.817 --> 37:16.985
Hurry up.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.655
Sonny Jim!

37:19.780 --> 37:20.989
Get going!

37:59.653 --> 38:02.447
Sonny Jim, get down here!

41:13.013 --> 41:14.890
Here's your coffee.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.147
Coffee.

41:33.575 --> 41:35.869
- Dougie!
- Ah!

41:37.412 --> 41:39.122
Hi!

41:46.213 --> 41:47.297
You got to see this.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.092
We got a hit on the prints
we took off the male John Doe.

41:51.218 --> 41:53.178
- What's the name?
- Don't know. It's blocked.

41:53.303 --> 41:54.930
Some kind of security issue.

41:55.055 --> 41:56.640
Well, can you tell
who blocked it?

41:56.765 --> 41:58.225
Military.

41:59.351 --> 42:00.852
Oh.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.412
Thank you for meeting us.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.331
Let's get going.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.910
We're not anywhere
near Mount Rushmore.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.498
I brought a picture for you.

43:06.001 --> 43:08.753
There they are, Albert...

43:08.878 --> 43:11.256
faces of stone.

43:23.226 --> 43:25.603
Agent Preston gets carsick.

43:27.397 --> 43:28.982
Albert...

43:29.107 --> 43:31.818
we're in South Dakota.

43:31.943 --> 43:34.779
Cossacks are in Russia.

43:35.822 --> 43:36.823
Carsick!

43:38.908 --> 43:40.618
Do you need me to pull over?

43:50.462 --> 43:53.631
Up on the wrong side of bed
this morning, Albert?

44:30.251 --> 44:31.461
What have we got?

44:31.586 --> 44:33.838
We found him after his car
went off the road.

44:33.963 --> 44:36.758
He'd been, uh, throwing up
some kind of poison.

44:36.883 --> 44:39.344
Must have eaten locally.

44:39.469 --> 44:41.805
They're, uh, analyzing it
in the lab.

44:41.930 --> 44:45.475
Exposure to it sent
the highway patrolman to the hospital.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.768
Huh.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.572
As I mentioned,
the vomit's still in the lab.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.991
This is what we found
in his trunk‒

45:02.117 --> 45:03.993
cocaine,

45:04.119 --> 45:07.038
machine gun,

45:07.163 --> 45:08.915
dog leg.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.168
What, no cheese and crackers?

45:12.293 --> 45:14.963
Apologies in advance
for Albert.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.933
That's your man, right?

45:27.058 --> 45:29.519
Holy jumpin' George.

45:32.230 --> 45:34.232
Let's go talk to him.

45:44.951 --> 45:46.744
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:46.870 --> 45:51.583
I am going to speak now
to Special Agent Dale Cooper.

45:51.708 --> 45:53.668
We'll be down the hall
if you need us.

45:53.793 --> 45:55.545
Thank you, Warden Murphy.

46:26.951 --> 46:29.162
It's yrev, very good

46:29.287 --> 46:32.499
to see you again, old friend.

46:33.917 --> 46:35.585
It's very, very good to see

46:35.710 --> 46:37.962
<i>you</i> again, old friend.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.008
I haven't seen you

46:42.133 --> 46:44.802
in a long, long time.

46:45.929 --> 46:47.764
No, you haven't.

46:47.889 --> 46:49.974
This is true.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.104
Gordon, I've really,
really missed

46:55.230 --> 46:57.774
spending time together.

46:59.108 --> 47:00.401
Yes, Coop.

47:00.527 --> 47:04.155
I, too, have missed
our good times together.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.491
Where have you been
all these years?

47:07.992 --> 47:09.869
Gordon,

47:09.994 --> 47:13.206
I've been working undercover

47:13.331 --> 47:14.832
all these years,

47:14.958 --> 47:17.877
working primarily
with our colleague

47:18.002 --> 47:20.213
Phillip Jeffries.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.799
Phillip Jeffries?

47:22.924 --> 47:25.802
I need to be debriefed by you

47:25.927 --> 47:29.305
about this work, Gordon.

47:29.430 --> 47:32.559
I will tell you
the whole story,

47:32.684 --> 47:35.853
all its twists and turns,

47:35.979 --> 47:39.566
and I was going to do so.

47:39.691 --> 47:43.736
I was on my way
to present it to you.

47:43.861 --> 47:48.032
I was a little bit
behind schedule

47:48.157 --> 47:51.202
when my car veered over

47:51.327 --> 47:53.538
across the road,

47:53.663 --> 47:56.249
and I had my accident.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.709
Yes, Coop.

47:57.834 --> 48:00.003
This is how
and why we found you.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.754
I need to be debriefed

48:01.879 --> 48:04.299
by you, Gordon.

48:05.633 --> 48:09.012
I was on my way to present it.

48:09.137 --> 48:11.848
I was a little bit
behind schedule

48:11.973 --> 48:15.310
when my car veered over
off the road,

48:15.435 --> 48:18.521
and I had my accident.

48:22.650 --> 48:25.778
I've left messages.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.953
What messages were those, Coop?

48:37.415 --> 48:40.001
Messages so Phillip

48:40.126 --> 48:42.920
knows it's safe.

48:49.761 --> 48:51.262
Gordon?

48:51.387 --> 48:55.224
When are you going
to get me out of here?

48:55.350 --> 48:57.727
Coop, these fine fellows here

48:57.852 --> 49:00.772
have sufficient cause
to hold you for now.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.525
Of course,
I will be exonerated

49:04.651 --> 49:06.653
in courts of law.

49:06.778 --> 49:08.237
Very good, Coop.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.323
And rest assured
that we are working

49:10.448 --> 49:13.409
to bring you back home
for our talk.

49:15.286 --> 49:19.123
I've never really left home,
Gordon.

49:22.168 --> 49:24.462
See you soon, old friend.

49:52.407 --> 49:54.033
We can hold him
for two more days

49:54.158 --> 49:56.202
without filing any charges.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.705
I assume you haven't
given him his phone call.

49:58.830 --> 50:00.289
No, we haven't.

50:00.415 --> 50:03.042
Warden Murphy,
I suggest you give him

50:03.167 --> 50:05.294
his private phone call,

50:05.420 --> 50:07.922
and I expect to hear
all about it.

50:12.635 --> 50:15.596
He wasn't going to Philadelphia.
He was headed west.

50:15.722 --> 50:17.640
A few people who have come
in contact with him

50:17.765 --> 50:19.767
have gotten physically ill.

50:21.102 --> 50:23.521
Are you feeling
all right, Albert?

50:23.646 --> 50:25.106
I'm fine, Tammy.

50:25.231 --> 50:27.024
And who
is Phillip Jeffries?

50:28.484 --> 50:30.862
He's a former FBI agent.

50:37.827 --> 50:40.204
You're wearing a wire, Tammy.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.373
You asked me to.

50:42.498 --> 50:44.250
Right.
Go wait in the restaurant.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.888
I'm feeling better now.

51:13.029 --> 51:17.533
Albert, your reaction
in prison to Cooper,

51:17.658 --> 51:20.286
I've not seen this before.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.663
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

51:30.129 --> 51:32.215
Well, since you asked,

51:32.340 --> 51:35.927
and I can't tell you
how sorry I am about this...

51:37.595 --> 51:41.390
...I authorized Phillip
to give Cooper some information.

51:42.391 --> 51:45.394
Cooper and Phillip?

51:45.520 --> 51:47.271
What the hell?

51:47.396 --> 51:50.191
Phillip Jeffries has been
off the radar for years.

51:50.316 --> 51:52.151
This was years ago, Gordon.

51:52.276 --> 51:53.236
He called me.

51:53.361 --> 51:55.488
He did, did he?

51:55.613 --> 51:57.365
I know. I thought Cooper
was in trouble‒

51:57.490 --> 51:59.367
at least
that's what Phillip said.

51:59.492 --> 52:01.536
"Urgent," he said.

52:01.661 --> 52:05.081
Cooper needed
this information urgently.

52:05.206 --> 52:06.541
Did you talk to Cooper?

52:06.666 --> 52:08.292
No.

52:08.417 --> 52:10.711
What information
did they want?

52:12.880 --> 52:15.925
I told Phillip
who our man was in Colombia.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.093
And?

52:17.218 --> 52:19.846
A week later,
that man was killed.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.097
Albert.

52:22.223 --> 52:23.266
Albert.

52:29.856 --> 52:31.983
Albert.

52:47.623 --> 52:51.627
This business that we witnessed
today with Cooper,

52:51.752 --> 52:53.296
I don't like it.

52:53.421 --> 52:55.715
No.

52:55.840 --> 52:56.966
Something's wrong.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.093
Yes.

52:59.218 --> 53:02.096
It could be the accident,
but I don't think so.

53:02.221 --> 53:03.139
No.

53:04.265 --> 53:06.267
Albert, that sound you just made

53:06.392 --> 53:08.060
of your feet on the concrete,

53:08.185 --> 53:09.854
it's like a knife in my brain.

53:09.979 --> 53:11.188
I'm sorry, Gordon.

53:11.314 --> 53:14.275
Albert, this thing
is turned up to the max.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.193
Please.

53:17.737 --> 53:20.031
I'm sorry, Gordon.

53:23.034 --> 53:24.994
I don't think
he greeted me properly,

53:25.119 --> 53:26.579
if you take my meaning.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.414
No, he didn't.

53:29.624 --> 53:32.084
Something is very wrong.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.336
Yes.

53:36.005 --> 53:40.009
Albert, I hate to admit this,

53:40.134 --> 53:43.346
but I don't understand
this situation at all.

53:43.471 --> 53:45.473
No.

53:51.562 --> 53:54.440
Do you understand
this situation, Albert?

54:00.571 --> 54:02.281
Blue Rose.

54:02.406 --> 54:05.284
It doesn't get any bluer.

54:05.409 --> 54:08.746
Albert, before we do
anything else,

54:08.871 --> 54:12.166
we need one certain person
to take a look at Cooper.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.709
I'm right with you.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.379
Do you still know
where she lives?

54:16.504 --> 54:18.297
I know where she drinks.
