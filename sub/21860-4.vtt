00:06.907 --> 00:08.642
ANNOUNCER:
American Horror Story: Cult.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.544
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.650
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.854
*

00:38.639 --> 00:40.141
Hello.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.778
Is that a mustache?

00:46.914 --> 00:49.683
You've got a full mustache.

00:49.717 --> 00:53.354
How did a little boy like you
grow a full mustache?

00:53.387 --> 00:56.890
What are you getting up to?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.962
What's this game?

01:01.995 --> 01:04.765
You're trying to fool someone?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.102
Why are you going

01:08.136 --> 01:10.538
around this store...

01:10.571 --> 01:13.241
in a fake mustache like that?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.008
For what?

01:17.445 --> 01:21.549
Suppose I go
and get the store manager,

01:21.582 --> 01:24.618
or the security guard,

01:24.652 --> 01:28.422
and we'll see
about your fake mustache?

01:28.456 --> 01:31.625
Because I think you...

01:31.659 --> 01:33.361
(urinating)

01:46.039 --> 01:48.442
SAM:
Mom?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.651
Mom?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.119
Phil?

02:01.355 --> 02:03.791
Don't you tell.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.662
I got the Dan Greenburg
hardcover.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.331
Good.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.200
You okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.801
Okay?
No. You go.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.703
What? Why?
Because...

02:15.736 --> 02:17.438
You're not getting
a book? Ow!
I'm not.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.106
Jesus.
I'm not getting a book.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.175
Why are you pushing?
I don't want
anything from here.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.810
Are you...?
They didn't have
what I wanted.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.578
SAM: Why are you
in such a hurry?
Because I want...

02:25.413 --> 02:27.181
* Mother

02:27.215 --> 02:30.518
* You had me

02:30.551 --> 02:35.423
* But I never had you

02:39.560 --> 02:43.431
* I wanted you

02:45.098 --> 02:50.070
* You didn't want me.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.911
Mom, what was the name of
that lame camp you sent us to?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.713
Mom!

02:59.747 --> 03:01.515
What?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.484
Sorry. What I do?

03:03.517 --> 03:06.587
You sent us
to a lame camp, remember?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.356
Oh.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.724
Sorry. I tried
to pick a good one.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.826
(phone dings)
I'm bad.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.263
No. Mom,
what was the camp called?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.598
(phone dings)

03:17.631 --> 03:20.434
Never mind. It's fine.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.536
(phone dings)

03:31.812 --> 03:36.417
Um, can somebody help me
with the cans?

03:36.450 --> 03:39.687
Somebody? Helping?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.122
Please?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.892
Okay, thank you.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.927
(Frankie screams)

03:48.161 --> 03:51.098
(gasps)
Daisy!

03:51.131 --> 03:52.466
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.868
(gasps):
Oh!

03:54.902 --> 03:56.203
Did she fall down the stairs?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.538
What happened?
SAM: Oh, no.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.708
Honey, I think
she just got old.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.043
Mom, check if she's dead!

04:03.076 --> 04:03.911
She's dead.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.879
Daisy!
Baby,

04:05.913 --> 04:08.048
I'm so sorry.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.419
Can we get a rabbit tomorrow?
Max. Give me a break here.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
Mom, what are you
gonna do with her?

04:12.953 --> 04:16.324
Ugh. I don't know.
I think maybe we should

04:16.357 --> 04:18.992
just bury her outside.
Ew.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.094
SAM: Ugh.
FRANKIE: You should
call animal control.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.963
I have homework.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.403
(Duke sniffles)

04:29.437 --> 04:32.673
You want to help me
with the dog, honey?

04:32.706 --> 04:36.276
We could do it together? Hmm?
(Duke sighs, sniffles)

04:36.310 --> 04:39.046
(sniffles loudly)
I need some time alone.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.516
Sorry, Mom.
I love you.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.518
You okay?

04:44.552 --> 04:47.455
Yeah, I'm okay.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.357
I understand.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.625
I'll take care of her.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.293
Love you. Mm.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.396
(crying)
I'm sorry.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.543
(sighs)

05:14.181 --> 05:16.550
(sighs)

05:22.990 --> 05:25.426
Hello, darling.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.696
Ooh.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.999
(groans softly)
There we are. Okay.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.167
Thank you

05:34.201 --> 05:35.669
for picking me up,
darling.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.738
I couldn't find my car.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.674
SAM:
It's okay, Mom, but we have to

05:40.708 --> 05:42.843
make a stop at
animal control.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.645
You're not getting
another dog.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.179
No.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.149
I'm dropping off Daisy.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.852
She's in the back.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.021
Oh. She's dead?

05:54.054 --> 05:56.890
Yep.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.727
Hmm. You know what that means?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.429
What?

06:01.462 --> 06:04.932
Someone new is coming
into your life.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.035
One out, one in.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.937
Always works like that.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.773
You always have
the same amount of love.

06:14.074 --> 06:18.579
I don't... know
about that, Phil.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.584
Are you okay?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.285
You seem off.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.120
You're off.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.961
Something's going on
with you.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.068
Is that what
you're going to do with me?

06:41.101 --> 06:43.504
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.641
I thought so.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.110
(rapid knocking on door)

06:52.112 --> 06:54.081
What?!

07:01.021 --> 07:02.155
Mom!

07:02.189 --> 07:04.291
What?
What are you doing?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.393
Frankie, go away.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.596
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.
Why are you sleeping?

07:08.629 --> 07:11.465
It's Saturday. Jesus.
What do you want?

07:11.499 --> 07:14.902
Mom, can we adopt a
Syrian refugee baby?
No.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.604
Mom, they're dying every day.
You're literally

07:16.637 --> 07:18.906
murdering a baby
by not adopting one right now.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.941
Frankie! Get out!

07:20.974 --> 07:24.011
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.112
Leave me alone!

07:25.145 --> 07:26.179
Dude.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.215
Holy shit. Sorry.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.619
(door opens)

07:31.652 --> 07:33.220
(door slams)

07:34.354 --> 07:35.723
(phone vibrates)

07:41.394 --> 07:43.531
(vibrating continues)

07:46.033 --> 07:47.234
Hi.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.640
RICH:
Anyway, now he's all insulted

07:52.673 --> 07:54.007
because I didn't invite him,
but, honey,

07:54.041 --> 07:55.108
you have to draw the line
somewhere--

07:55.142 --> 07:56.343
it's like I see him more now

07:56.376 --> 07:57.811
than I did
when we were together.

07:57.845 --> 07:58.946
What am I supposed to do?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.948
I know.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.183
Oh, by the way, are you taking
the girls anywhere this summer?

08:03.216 --> 08:05.352
I don't know,
they never all want to do

08:05.385 --> 08:07.154
the same thing anymore.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.989
Well, they would if you made
them, but you're such a wimp.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.390
Shut up, Rich.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.525
What?

08:11.559 --> 08:13.160
You're an asshole.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.996
Are you being serious?
I can't see your face.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.497
(sighs)

08:17.531 --> 08:20.167
Can you meet me right now
at Pineapple Hill?

08:20.200 --> 08:23.704
Right now? I just got to work.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.706
Rich, please, please,

08:25.739 --> 08:28.441
please, please, please meet me.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.845
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.483
Where are you going, Rich?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.151
We're about to start.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.621
(engine starts)
Lunch is over!

08:52.566 --> 08:54.034
RICH:
Sammy.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.603
What is it?
What's going on?

08:55.636 --> 08:56.837
Is it your mom?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.105
Mom's sick?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.873
Something's wrong
with Mom? No?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.577
Honey, you have
to tell me.

09:03.611 --> 09:07.280
You can't tell anyone
in the world, okay?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.617
No matter what,
you got to promise me.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.284
No matter what I tell you,

09:11.318 --> 09:12.920
you can't take back
your promise.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.554
I won't tell anyone.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.423
Promise.
I promise.
What? Why? Why?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.892
Have I ever asked you once
to keep a secret?

09:18.926 --> 09:21.228
No, honey, you've never
asked me for anything ever.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.429
That's why I ran over here.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.697
Tell me what I can't tell.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.700
(sighs):
Oh, God.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.602
I met somebody.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.804
What?

09:30.838 --> 09:34.574
I met a guy...
(groaning)

09:34.608 --> 09:35.876
Why is that a secret?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.477
Because...

09:37.510 --> 09:39.713
I really like him,

09:39.747 --> 09:42.315
and it feels like it could be,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.952
like, a serious thing.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.720
Uh, that's wonderful.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.889
No! Don't say that!

09:48.922 --> 09:51.558
Stop saying that! I don't want
you to say that right now.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
Well, Sammy, what the
hell, is he married?

09:53.627 --> 09:55.062
No.
Does he have...

09:55.095 --> 09:56.730
bad things about him?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.732
No. No.
Things you don't
want to talk about?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.567
Is he Robert Blake
or something?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.102
No.
Is he, like,

10:02.135 --> 10:05.238
16-years-old?
I don't know.
No!

10:05.272 --> 10:07.240
Sam... (sighs)
...talk.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.009
Stop this. Talk.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.577
Now. You met a guy.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.479
You really like him
and it might be serious.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.614
Tell me the bad part now.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.317
I just... I really like him.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.987
Like, he checks all the boxes.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.123
He's not perfect,
but even that's a box. Check.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.258
And he really likes me.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.094
Like, he makes me f...

10:27.127 --> 10:28.962
you know, feel like...

10:28.996 --> 10:31.364
(groans)

10:31.398 --> 10:32.700
...like a...

10:32.733 --> 10:35.669
like a lady feeling
kind of thing.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.838
Ew. Gross.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.206
I know.

10:39.239 --> 10:43.143
I haven't felt like this
since ever.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.678
Okay, so...

10:44.712 --> 10:46.714
why is this bad news?
Why is this a crisis?

10:46.747 --> 10:49.683
(inhales, exhales sharply)

10:49.717 --> 10:51.952
(sniffs)
Because...

10:51.985 --> 10:54.321
I don't know
how to do this, Rich.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.123
I don't know where this goes.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.459
I got no place to put it.
And I don't want it.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.561
I don't.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.398
I-I feel mad and scared
and upset,

11:05.432 --> 11:07.567
and it gives me anxiety.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.369
I mean...

11:09.402 --> 11:11.238
this is it.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.006
This guy's the thing.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.877
And it's screwing up my life...

11:16.910 --> 11:18.746
and I-I...

11:18.779 --> 11:20.213
it's freaking me out,

11:20.247 --> 11:21.481
and I haven't told anybody

11:21.514 --> 11:23.516
because I don't want it
to be real.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.486
I'm just trying to figure out
how to break up with him.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.088
Break up with him?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.489
Yeah.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.760
How do you, uh,
break up with a great guy?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.196
Sam, oh, my God.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.732
(sighs heavily) You've gotten
too good at being alone.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.401
You've been hanging out with me
too long, that's your problem.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.736
Mm-hmm.
We're silver singles together.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.604
Yes! Yes!

11:44.637 --> 11:47.407
This is so easy.
(laughing)

11:47.440 --> 11:49.576
Rich, it's not funny.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.244
Don't laugh.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.280
I mean it.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.515
I'm upset. It's not funny.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.684
It's bad.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.588
I mean, why am I being
such a loser?

12:01.621 --> 12:03.023
We were both born losers, honey.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.858
And all your coping skills
are for that.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.727
So... this is gonna be hard.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.598
(exhales):
Ooh...

12:11.631 --> 12:14.067
What do I do?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.103
I don't know.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.871
Oh, God.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.707
It's like I'm sick.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.442
I...

12:22.475 --> 12:24.611
feel like I have the flu.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.747
I'm shaking all the time,
I-I cry.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.482
I'm tired.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.951
I'm mean to everybody.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.485
My stomach hurts all day.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.154
I have a headache.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.156
Okay, Peggy Ann McKay,
so you're sick.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.826
So... drink lots of water,
get lots of sleep,

12:38.859 --> 12:42.295
BRAT diet-- Bananas,
Rice, Applesauce, Toast.

12:42.329 --> 12:46.166
Wait it out-- but you do not
get to break up with him.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.970
I don't?

12:50.003 --> 12:52.339
Oh, my God, I love you.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.274
"Oh, no! I met
a great guy!

12:54.307 --> 12:57.010
What do I do?"

12:57.044 --> 12:59.479
*

13:10.190 --> 13:11.324
* Mercy

13:11.358 --> 13:14.027
* Mer...

13:14.061 --> 13:16.163
* Cy

13:16.196 --> 13:18.165
* Mercy, mercy

13:19.632 --> 13:21.835
* Coming to ya.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.144
(crow cawing nearby)

13:31.178 --> 13:32.612
Where's your key?

13:32.645 --> 13:33.780
Hi.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.115
My dad's dropping me off.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.516
I told him
he could stay for dinner.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.651
What?

13:38.685 --> 13:39.686
Mom, don't be weird.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.488
He's my da-ha-ha-had.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.689
XANDER:
Hello.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.291
Hi, there.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.859
Daddy!

13:45.893 --> 13:48.661
(Duke laughs)

13:48.695 --> 13:50.931
Oh! Oh. Oh.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.205
(phone vibrating)

13:58.238 --> 14:00.240
Daddy's staying
for dinner.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.547
Are you staying, Dad?

14:07.580 --> 14:10.350
Well, gee...

14:12.619 --> 14:14.687
It's up to your mom.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.929
SAM:
Oh.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.363
Sure. Of course.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.697
Yes.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.268
Come on. I want to show you
my school project.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.870
(groans)

14:30.904 --> 14:32.272
I'm almost done with it,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.874
but I want to show you.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.387
When did you
redo the floors?

14:47.420 --> 14:50.590
Um, I didn't, but...

14:50.623 --> 14:52.359
(indistinct chatter)

14:52.392 --> 14:55.095
Dad.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.396
I hope so.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.131
Hi.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.400
XANDER:
Who's this?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.936
That's Paisley, Dad.

15:02.970 --> 15:06.206
(scoffs)
I know it's Paisley.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.207
Come on.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.208
You're so tall.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.642
Yeah.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.149
* Just sing this riff
and it's bound to go *

15:16.183 --> 15:18.818
* The flat feet floogie
with the floy, floy *

15:18.851 --> 15:20.420
We should...

15:20.453 --> 15:21.921
we should probably go.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.156
What?

15:23.190 --> 15:24.958
Um, you should...

15:24.992 --> 15:27.327
do your dad.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.329
Okay, just text me later.
Yeah, of course.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.463
Okay.
Bye, Sam.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.464
SAM:
Bye, honey.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.233
Please make your chicken

15:33.266 --> 15:34.968
covered with bacon again
for me soon.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.903
SAM: I will. Tell your mom
I send my love, okay?

15:36.936 --> 15:37.971
PAISLEY:
I will. Bye.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.973
SAM: Bye! Bye!
MAX: Bye!

15:40.007 --> 15:42.009
(quietly):
Mom.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.077
You invite Dad for dinner and
you don't warn me or tell me.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.013
Shh, shh, shh.
Do you know how

15:46.046 --> 15:48.648
effin' awkward this is? And
you-you didn't do anything...
Shh.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.283
(whispers):
...that a mother does.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.620
Do you ever plan ahead?

15:53.653 --> 15:56.456
Jesus, Max, I didn't invite him.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.091
He was dropping Frankie off.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.993
This got grandfathered in.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.995
Well, maybe if you did
invite him once in a while,

16:02.029 --> 16:03.430
things could be less awkward.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.133
Sorry, Mom, you
know it's true.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.200
(sighs)

16:07.234 --> 16:09.136
Sorry not sorry.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.770
(groans)

16:10.803 --> 16:12.005
Yes, Max,

16:12.039 --> 16:14.007
you're right.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.842
You're right.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.844
That's something
that I should do.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.880
And... I can't.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.483
I just can't.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.717
I'm a shitty mother.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.386
Okay, Mom.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.188
Let's go back
to fake you fake smiling.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.827
Okay.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.121
Would you like to put Duke
or Frankie to bed?

18:08.155 --> 18:11.924
Uh, I don't think
that'd be appropriate.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.328
I mean, this is
your house, after all.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.464
I want to be respectful.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.200
Who's putting me to bed?

18:22.169 --> 18:23.870
Dad, put me to bed.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.644
I'm gonna put you
to bed, Franks.
Ugh.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.079
Good night, Xander.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.981

18:36.015 --> 18:37.517

with you today.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.319
Me, too.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.788
I'll see you next time
I'm in town.
Okay.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.356
See ya. Wait, when?

18:43.390 --> 18:46.426
Uh, hopefully June.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.995
We'll see.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.867
Bro, you comin'?

18:54.901 --> 18:56.703
Uh, I'm gonna walk your dad
to his car.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.104
And I'll be

18:58.137 --> 18:59.105
right up.

What a time, huh?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.351
I'll tell you,
it's the funniest thing.
