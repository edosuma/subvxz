D-oh!

00:10.090 --> 00:10.730
( <i>screams )</i>

00:31.430 --> 00:32.729
Hey everybody,
Bret Gunselman here

00:32.800 --> 00:35.430
on pivotal week eight
of the N.F.L. season.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.340
Now stay tuned for six hours
of exciting football action.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.740
Well, bye-bye belt.

00:43.070 --> 00:46.310
( <i>loud crunching
and swallowing )</i>

00:51.980 --> 00:53.920
Homer, all those fatty

00:53.980 --> 00:56.440
deep-fried,
heavily-salted snacks

00:56.520 --> 00:58.720
can't be good
for your heart.

00:58.790 --> 01:00.930
My heart is just fine.

01:03.830 --> 01:04.700
( <i>creaking noises )</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:07.470
( <i>gasping )</i>

01:07.530 --> 01:10.300
A little beer
will put out that fire.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.570
And now with the specs
for today's games

01:12.640 --> 01:13.870
The man who's right

01:13.940 --> 01:17.140
52% of the time,
Smooth Jimmy Apollo.

01:17.210 --> 01:20.250
Thank you Bret,
our first game today,
Denver and New England

01:20.310 --> 01:21.410
is too close to call.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.980
Oh...

01:23.050 --> 01:25.120
<i>but if you're
one of those compulsive types</i>

01:25.180 --> 01:26.350
<i>who just has to bet...</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:28.090
well, I don't know.

01:28.150 --> 01:29.690
Mmm... Denver!

01:29.750 --> 01:30.790
Woo-whoo!

01:30.850 --> 01:32.310
Denver! Yeah!

01:32.390 --> 01:33.490
Moe's Tavern

01:33.560 --> 01:35.830
where the peanut bowl
is freshened hourly.

01:35.890 --> 01:38.560
Moe, I'd like to bet $20
on Denver.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.830
I think I can provide
that service.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.770
Chief Wiggum,
could you hand me

01:42.830 --> 01:44.470
that little black book?

01:44.530 --> 01:45.560
Sure thing, Moe.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.530
I was just using it
as a coaster.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.860
<i>20 big ones on Denver.</i>

01:48.940 --> 01:50.810
Pleasure doing
business with you.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.530
H.S.

01:52.610 --> 01:55.550
All right, Denver,
justify my love.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.250
<i>At the end of
13 seconds of play</i>

01:57.310 --> 01:59.710
<i>it's New England seven,
Denver nothing.</i>

01:59.780 --> 02:00.720
D-oh!

02:00.780 --> 02:01.880
Look, Dad.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.220
I made a model
studio apartment

02:03.290 --> 02:05.060
for my Malibu Stacy doll.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.520
This is a kitchen.

02:06.590 --> 02:09.789
This is where she prints
her weekly feminist newsletter.

02:09.860 --> 02:12.300
Dad, you're not listening to me!

02:12.360 --> 02:14.400
Lousy, stupid Denver.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.190
Mmm!

02:16.270 --> 02:18.300
( <i>humming )</i>

02:18.370 --> 02:21.570
Oh, look at that,
a shoe box house.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.680
Lisa, you're so clever.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.680
Why isn't Dad
ever interested

02:25.740 --> 02:27.150
in anything I do?

02:27.210 --> 02:30.680
Well...do you ever take an
interest in anything he does?

02:30.750 --> 02:33.750
No... well, we used
to have burping contests

02:33.820 --> 02:35.190
but I outgrew it.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.260
If you want to get closer
to him

02:37.320 --> 02:39.390
maybe you should bridge the gap.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.030
I do it all the time.

02:41.090 --> 02:43.830
I pretend I'm interested in
looking at power tools

02:43.890 --> 02:46.020
going to those silly
car-chase movies

02:46.100 --> 02:48.900
and.. some things I'll tell
you about when you're older.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.260
Do you understand?

02:50.330 --> 02:51.660
I think so.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.360
Bart!
What?!

02:53.440 --> 02:55.370
Homer:
Oh, look at that.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.870
Why did you do that?

02:56.940 --> 02:58.280
Wouldn't it be fun

02:58.340 --> 03:00.550
if we watched the game
together?

03:00.610 --> 03:01.880
Uh...

03:01.940 --> 03:03.270
Okay.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.550
Just don't say anything,
and sit down over there.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.720
Over.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.040
Over.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.220
Over.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.790
Over.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.130
( <i>sighing )</i>

03:14.190 --> 03:16.490
Lisa, please,
I can't hear the announcer.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.400
He said
Denver just fumbled.

03:18.460 --> 03:19.360
D-oh!

03:21.900 --> 03:24.470
See you in hell, soldier boy.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.890
( <i>evil chuckling )</i>

03:25.970 --> 03:26.700
Bart?

03:26.770 --> 03:28.310
Yeah, Mom.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.540
I was thinking that
while your father and Lisa
watch the game

03:30.610 --> 03:33.280
it might be fun
if the two of us
went clothes shopping.

03:33.340 --> 03:36.280
Mom, I'd love to,
but to be honest,
I don't need new clothes.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.780
Oh, really?

03:40.620 --> 03:42.820
So even though
I'd love to spend

03:42.890 --> 03:46.660
this sunny afternoon
trying on clothes, it's not...

03:46.720 --> 03:50.030
Folks, when you're right
52% of the time

03:50.090 --> 03:52.530
you're wrong 48% of the time.

03:52.590 --> 03:54.260
Why didn't you
say that before?!

03:54.330 --> 03:56.170
Okay, Jimmy,
you're off the hook.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.140
We've got Miami-Cincinnati
coming up. Any thoughts?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.770
I certainly do, Bret.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.570
I hereby declare Miami

04:01.640 --> 04:04.540
to be Smooth Jimmy's
'Lock of the Week.'

04:04.610 --> 04:06.210
Ooh, that's a big lock, alright.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.180
I just don't trust that guy.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.170
In the Cincinnati-Miami game

04:11.250 --> 04:14.490
I declare Cincinnati to be
my 'Shoe-in of the Week.'

04:14.550 --> 04:16.089
They both make a good case.

04:17.350 --> 04:20.550
After evaluating
millions of pieces of data

04:20.620 --> 04:22.280
in the blink of an eye

04:22.360 --> 04:26.010
the Gambletron 2000 says
the winner is... Cincinnati

04:26.080 --> 04:28.180
by 200 points?!

04:28.250 --> 04:30.790
Why, you worthless hunk of junk!

04:33.690 --> 04:34.560
You want some of this,
don't you?

04:34.620 --> 04:36.060
Yeah!!

04:36.120 --> 04:37.860
Well, you need to know the
winners, and I know the winners.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.220
So call me now.

04:39.290 --> 04:42.360
$5 for the first minute,
$2 for each additional minute.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.420
( <i>slowly: )
<i>You... have reached...</i></i>

04:46.500 --> 04:47.670

04:49.740 --> 04:50.670
<i>Line.</i>

04:50.740 --> 04:52.170
Lay it on me, coach.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.840
<i>na...ti.
Cincinnati.</i>

05:00.910 --> 05:03.710
C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize
this is costing me money?

05:03.780 --> 05:06.840
<i>We must consider...
many things.</i>

05:06.920 --> 05:08.260
<i>The wind...</i>

05:08.320 --> 05:09.720
D-oh, not the wind!

<i>Is blowing out of the...</i>

05:11.460 --> 05:12.530

05:15.230 --> 05:16.000
<i>Knots.
D-ooohh!</i>

05:16.060 --> 05:17.630
This is ridiculous!

05:17.700 --> 05:21.270
What am I supposed to do?
Lisa, who do you think's
gonna win?

05:21.330 --> 05:22.330
The Bengals or the Dolphins?

05:22.400 --> 05:23.500
I don't know.

05:23.570 --> 05:24.840
The Dolphins?

05:24.900 --> 05:26.000
Good, good.

05:26.070 --> 05:28.510
Moe, $50 on the Miami Dolphins.

05:28.570 --> 05:30.230
Gotcha. 50 beans on Miami.

05:30.310 --> 05:32.750
Homer, I got a call
on the other line. Hello?

05:32.810 --> 05:34.520
Moe, it's me, Mr. K.

05:34.580 --> 05:35.650
( <i>laughing )</i>

05:35.710 --> 05:36.870
Yeah, yeah, what will it be?

05:36.950 --> 05:38.750
Put me down for $700
on the Rams.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.020
( <i>honks horn )</i>

05:40.090 --> 05:41.920
Oh, and put Sideshow Mel down
for two grand.

05:41.990 --> 05:43.190
Mom, I'm tired.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.930
I want to go home.

05:44.990 --> 05:47.760
Can't I just lie down
for a minute?

05:47.830 --> 05:50.030
Bart, I think
you'd look very sharp

05:50.100 --> 05:51.170
in this shirt.

05:51.230 --> 05:52.870
Fine. Get it. Let's <i>go.</i>

05:52.930 --> 05:53.940
No, no, no.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.400
You have to try it on.

05:55.470 --> 05:58.010
Ooh, and this one's 50% off.

05:58.070 --> 06:00.070
You know why these
clothes are on sale, Mom?

06:00.140 --> 06:02.240
Because the people
who wear them get beaten up.

06:02.310 --> 06:05.910
Well, anyone who would
beat you up for wearing
a shirt isn't your friend.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.120
Ooh, this looks good,

06:07.180 --> 06:09.320
and this one
is very, very cute

06:09.380 --> 06:11.020
and these...

06:11.080 --> 06:13.640
Oh, look, little bow ties!

06:13.720 --> 06:16.160
And don't make
that face at me.

06:16.220 --> 06:17.530
How did you know?

06:17.590 --> 06:19.660
Touchdown, Dolphins!

06:19.730 --> 06:21.030
All right, Dolphins!

06:21.090 --> 06:22.350
All right, Dolphins!

06:22.430 --> 06:23.100
Whoo-hoo!

06:23.160 --> 06:24.270
Whoo-hoo!

06:24.330 --> 06:25.870
50 big ones!

06:25.930 --> 06:27.070
50 big ones?

06:27.130 --> 06:28.230
Uh-oh.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.070
You see, Lisa,
Daddy's friend Moe promised

06:30.140 --> 06:32.970
to give him $50
if the Dolphins won the game.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.040
You mean you made a bet?

06:34.110 --> 06:35.710
I wouldn't call it a bet.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.570
It's a little thing
Daddies do

06:37.640 --> 06:39.570
to make football
more exciting.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.420
What could
be more exciting

06:41.480 --> 06:43.920
than the savage ballet
that is pro football?

06:43.980 --> 06:45.240
Well, you know.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.820
You like ice cream,
don't you?

06:46.890 --> 06:47.790
Uh-huh.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.580
Don't you like
ice cream better

06:49.660 --> 06:51.660
when it's covered
with hot fudge

06:51.720 --> 06:54.620
and mounds of whipped cream,
chopped nuts

06:54.690 --> 06:57.790
and those crumbled-up
cookie things they mash up?

06:57.860 --> 06:59.020
Mmm...

06:59.100 --> 07:01.100
Crumbled-up cookie things.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.770
So gambling makes a good thing
even better?

07:03.840 --> 07:04.810
That's right!

07:04.870 --> 07:06.170
My God...

07:06.240 --> 07:09.110
it's like there's
some kind of bond between us.

07:13.710 --> 07:14.980
Hmm?

07:16.210 --> 07:17.710
Mm-hmm.

07:25.590 --> 07:27.560
We've got a troublemaker
in booth eight.

07:27.630 --> 07:30.630
Forget him.
There's a code red
in booth three.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.670
My God!

07:31.730 --> 07:32.530
<i>Those aren't the socks</i>

07:32.600 --> 07:33.500
<i>she came in with.</i>

07:33.570 --> 07:35.300
Um-um...Let's move.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.670
- <i>Bart?
- In here mom, but</i>

07:40.740 --> 07:41.710
Don't open the..

07:41.770 --> 07:42.700
( <i>screaming )</i>

07:42.770 --> 07:44.040
( <i>giggling )</i>

07:44.110 --> 07:47.150
Bart, you could use
some new underwear too.

07:47.210 --> 07:50.110
Man:
Look at that stupid kid!

07:50.180 --> 07:51.350
Three!
Three!

07:51.420 --> 07:52.520
Two!
Two!

07:52.580 --> 07:53.680
One!
One!

07:53.750 --> 07:56.490
And the final
from Riverfront Stadium:

07:56.560 --> 07:59.030
Miami 24, Cincinnati 10.

07:59.090 --> 08:00.130
Yeah!
Yeah!

08:00.190 --> 08:03.000
Mom sure will be happy
you won $50.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.400
You'd think that,
wouldn't you?

08:04.460 --> 08:07.060
but you see, Lisa,
your mother has this
crazy idea

08:07.130 --> 08:09.300
that gambling is wrong

08:09.370 --> 08:11.310
even though they
say it's okay in the Bible.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.570
Really? Where?

08:12.640 --> 08:14.540
Uh... somewhere in the back.

08:14.610 --> 08:17.140
The point is,
we had a great time today.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.710
To keep it that way

08:18.780 --> 08:22.480
let's not tell your mother
about our little wager, okay?

08:22.550 --> 08:23.550
Okay, Dad.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.890
Did you two
have fun?

08:24.950 --> 08:26.190
You bet.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.420
( <i>giggling)</i>

08:27.490 --> 08:28.860
We had fun too.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.030
Right now,
Bart is modeling
his new clothes

08:31.090 --> 08:32.289
for his friends.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.230
Ooh...

08:34.289 --> 08:37.049
You got to come out
sometime, Simpson.

08:40.070 --> 08:41.970
Goodnight, Dad.
I had a nice time today.

08:42.030 --> 08:43.960
Me too, honey.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.140
Can I watch football
with you

08:45.200 --> 08:46.460
again next Sunday?

08:46.540 --> 08:47.940
Sure. You'll find
it gets rid

08:48.010 --> 08:50.310
of the unpleasant aftertaste
of church.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.210
See how good things can happen

08:52.280 --> 08:54.280
if you make
a little effort?

08:54.350 --> 08:58.150
Point well taken.
Uh, Mom... could you loosen
my blanket a little?

08:58.220 --> 08:59.690
Dad tucked me in too tight,
and it's cutting off

08:59.750 --> 09:02.390
the circulation
in my arms and legs.

09:02.450 --> 09:04.420
<i>This team is fired up.
We came here to play.</i>

09:04.490 --> 09:06.230
Alright!
He'll lose.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.760
What? Didn't you hear
what he said?

09:08.830 --> 09:11.930
Look at the fear in his eyes.
Listen to the quiver
in his voice.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.400
He's a little boy
lost in a game of men.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.500
Do you think we should
bet against them?

09:15.570 --> 09:17.410
I'd bet my entire
college fund on it.

09:17.470 --> 09:18.910
You got it.

09:18.970 --> 09:22.310
Moe, $23 on New York.

09:22.370 --> 09:24.270
Start spreading
the news.

09:24.340 --> 09:27.270
It's New York
over Philadelphia, 35 to 10.

09:27.350 --> 09:30.790
Yay!
Yay!

09:30.850 --> 09:31.690
Dad, I hate
to break the mood

09:31.750 --> 09:33.820
but I'm
getting nauseous.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.220
Oh, sorry.

09:35.290 --> 09:38.760
So, who do you like
in the afternoon games?

09:38.820 --> 09:41.050
Well, I like the 49ers
because they're pure of heart

09:41.130 --> 09:43.730
Seattle because they got
something to prove

09:43.800 --> 09:45.870
and the Raiders
because they always cheat.

09:45.930 --> 09:48.540
In an extremely suspicious play

09:48.600 --> 09:49.840
the Raiders win!

09:49.900 --> 09:51.170
Three for three!

09:56.910 --> 09:59.510
Hey, the new sign's
really working.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.380
It's been
a madhouse, Lisa.

10:01.450 --> 10:02.620
Let's see...

10:02.680 --> 10:04.720
Football... football...

10:04.780 --> 10:06.710
homoeroticism in...

10:06.790 --> 10:08.720
oddball Canadian rules...

10:08.790 --> 10:10.790
Phyllis George in...

10:10.860 --> 10:12.530
Oh, doctor,
what a finish!

10:12.590 --> 10:15.530
<i>The final score--
Atlanta 17, Houston 13.</i>

10:15.590 --> 10:17.420
<i>and the lowly Falcons
are flying high.</i>

10:17.500 --> 10:19.370
<i>Who would have thunk it?</i>

10:19.430 --> 10:20.870
My daughter, that's who.

10:20.930 --> 10:22.260
Yeah, me.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.260
Lisa, you pick the winner
every time.

10:24.340 --> 10:26.970
You must have some kind
of special gift.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.610
Come on Dad. It doesn't
take a genius

10:28.670 --> 10:31.670
to realize that Houston's failed
to cover their last ten outings

10:31.740 --> 10:33.240
on away turf the week after
scoring more

10:33.310 --> 10:35.380
than three touchdowns
in a conference game.

10:35.450 --> 10:38.390
My little girl
says the cutest things.

10:38.450 --> 10:40.550
Dad, Sunday
is fast becoming

10:40.620 --> 10:42.720
my favorite day
of the week.

10:42.790 --> 10:45.930
Not Sunday--
Daddy-Daughter Day.

10:45.990 --> 10:48.300
The usual, Moe--

10:48.360 --> 10:50.660
a beer...
and a wad of bills!

10:50.730 --> 10:52.300
Okay...

10:52.360 --> 10:54.890
( <i>quietly: )
You lucky moron.</i>

10:58.040 --> 11:00.640
Here you go, Homer, $135.

11:00.710 --> 11:03.980
I used to hate the smell
of your sweaty feet.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.250
Now it's the smell
of victory.

11:06.310 --> 11:07.920
Oh, shut up.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.320
( <i>Marge gasps )</i>

11:09.380 --> 11:11.320
Look at these prices.
We could finally get rid

11:11.380 --> 11:14.780
of those termites
for the cost of this meal.

11:14.850 --> 11:17.450
Tut-tut,
only the best for my family.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.280
Homer, I can't help wondering
where you're getting
the money from?

11:20.360 --> 11:23.160
Mom, can't a man do something
nice for his loved ones?

11:23.230 --> 11:24.570
I guess so.

11:24.630 --> 11:25.670
( <i>both laughing )</i>

11:25.730 --> 11:28.100
Hello, I'm Marco,
I'll be your waiter.

11:28.170 --> 11:30.670
Hello, I'm Homer,
I'll be your customer.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.940
( <i>all laughing )</i>

11:32.000 --> 11:34.170
Never heard that one before.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.510
Would you care
to select the wine?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.170
<i>I'll do the honors.</i>

11:38.240 --> 11:39.770
No, no, no, no.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.740
My God!

11:41.810 --> 11:44.410
What passes for a
wine list these days?

11:44.480 --> 11:45.980
Marco, just bring us your
freshest bottle of wine.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.690
Chop, chop.
( all giggle )

11:48.750 --> 11:50.850
Charming lad.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.950
Oh, violin guy.

11:54.030 --> 11:56.430
What's your favorite song,
Lisa?

11:56.490 --> 11:58.590
"The Broken Neck Blues."

11:58.660 --> 11:59.760
Play on.

11:59.830 --> 12:03.200
( <i>playing "Broken Neck Blues")</i>

12:07.370 --> 12:08.510
<i>It is the playoffs.</i>

12:08.570 --> 12:10.170
<i>It's five below.</i>

12:10.240 --> 12:12.580
<i>and there's one loyal fan
wearing nothing but a G-string.</i>

12:12.640 --> 12:14.840
<i>And the team colors
painted on his body.</i>

12:14.910 --> 12:16.940
<i>Commentator 2:
He doesn't look too happy.</i>

12:17.020 --> 12:19.320
<i>Well, maybe the paint has shut
off his pores and he's slowly
suffocating.</i>

12:19.380 --> 12:21.310
<i>Still, that is a real fan.</i>

12:21.390 --> 12:22.990
Well Lisa, it's
Daddy-daughter Day

12:23.050 --> 12:24.880
and Daddy needs
daughter's picks.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.630
Dad, I'm making the Chiefs
my five star, silver bullet
special.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.890
And with your blessing, I'd like
to tie it to the Cowboys

12:30.960 --> 12:32.320
plus five at Chicago.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.300
Good, good. You call Moe.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.140
Moe, this is L.S.
Calling for H.S.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.330
Just gimme the bet, Lisa.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.930
110, 120...

12:41.010 --> 12:43.080
You lucky son of a...

12:43.140 --> 12:44.710
Hey Homer, you want to go
bowling next Sunday?

12:44.780 --> 12:47.050
Barney, are you nuts?
That's the Super Bowl.

12:47.110 --> 12:49.220
How about the Sunday
after that?

12:49.280 --> 12:50.990
Well, my ma's coming in
from Norway

12:51.050 --> 12:52.420
but what the hell.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.510
( <i>belching )</i>

12:53.590 --> 12:54.890
<i>When the doctor said</i>

12:54.950 --> 12:57.730
I didn't have worms anymore,
that was the happiest day

12:57.810 --> 12:58.910
of my life.

12:58.970 --> 13:00.870
Thank you, Ralph,
very graphic.

13:00.940 --> 13:04.910
Lisa Simpson, would you like
to read your essay?

13:04.980 --> 13:08.590
The happiest day of my life
was three Sundays ago

13:08.650 --> 13:11.020
I was sitting on my Daddy's
knee when the Saints--

13:11.090 --> 13:12.860
who are four and a half point
favorites, but only up by
three--

13:12.920 --> 13:15.190
kicked a meaningless field goal

13:15.260 --> 13:17.630
at the last second
to cover the spread.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.090
Dear God!

13:19.160 --> 13:21.930
Oh Dad! You must
have bought me

13:22.000 --> 13:23.670
every Malibu Stacy
accessory there is.

13:23.730 --> 13:24.870
Not quite.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.630
They were out
of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.100
Ooh, perfume!

13:30.170 --> 13:32.210
"Meryl Streep's Versatility."

13:37.850 --> 13:39.820
Boy, I know you're going
to like your present.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.690
Shut up! Shut up!
Kiss my butt!

13:41.750 --> 13:43.150
Shut up!
Go to hell! Go to hell!

13:43.220 --> 13:45.220
Dad, I promise you,

13:45.290 --> 13:48.090
I will <i>never get tired of this.</i>

13:48.160 --> 13:49.960
Homer, those were
very thoughtful presents

13:50.020 --> 13:53.490
but you have to tell me
where you got the money from.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.330
Alright Marge, I'll tell you,
but first you have to promise
you will not get mad.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.800
I promise I <i>will get mad</i>

13:57.870 --> 14:00.670
because I always do when you
make me promise I won't.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.270
Alright, if you must know,
Lisa and I have been gambling
on pro football.

14:03.340 --> 14:04.380
Homer!

14:04.440 --> 14:05.710
You promised
you wouldn't get mad.

14:05.770 --> 14:07.900
I did not.
I promised I <i>would get mad.</i>

14:07.980 --> 14:09.910
She's an eight year old girl!

14:09.980 --> 14:11.880
Marge, she never loses.
She's got a gift.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.220
Aren't parents supposed
to encourage their kids

14:14.280 --> 14:15.240
whenever they show talent?

14:15.320 --> 14:16.450
But gambling is illegal.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.090
Oh, only in 48 states.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.050
Besides,
it's a victimless crime.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.750
The only victim is Moe

14:22.820 --> 14:25.320
and it's brought
Lisa and me together.

14:25.390 --> 14:26.620
I just don't know.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.260
What's the problem?

14:28.330 --> 14:31.240
The kids are happy,
you smell like Meryl Streep

14:31.300 --> 14:34.240
and I got that foot massager
I've always wanted.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.830
Believe me, Marge, nothing bad
could possibly come of this.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.310
You know, Dad

14:39.370 --> 14:41.400
we've been watching
a lot of TV lately.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.410
Maybe the Sunday
after the Super Bowl

14:43.480 --> 14:45.480
we could climb up to
the top of Mt. Springfield.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.490
The fires in the tire yards
really make for some
beautiful sunsets.

14:48.550 --> 14:52.390
That sounds great honey,
but next Sunday I'm going
bowling with Barney.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.350
What about
Daddy-Daughter Day?!

14:54.420 --> 14:57.180
Don't worry.
The new football season
is only seven months away.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.700
So that's it.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.370
You just wanted me
to help you gamble.

15:01.430 --> 15:04.500
You never wanted
to be with me at all.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.440
( <i>sobbing )</i>

15:06.500 --> 15:09.070
You're a very selfish man.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.670
<i>Go to hell!
Go to hell!</i>

15:10.740 --> 15:13.310
Hey, once again,
great present, Dad.

15:17.030 --> 15:18.670
Uh... uh...

15:20.200 --> 15:22.340
My third husband bought me this.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.170
Give me some chips for it.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.370
Are you sure Ma'am?

15:25.440 --> 15:27.410
Don't tell me
what to do Sonny.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.580
I've been gambling
since I was eight

15:29.640 --> 15:31.880
and I've been hocking jewelry
since I was 12.

15:31.940 --> 15:32.970
Now give me some chips.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.440
( <i>gasps )</i>

15:39.220 --> 15:41.220
Look around you, Malibu Stacy.

15:41.290 --> 15:43.690
All this was bought
with dirty money.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.530
Your penthouse, your Alfa-Romeo,
your collagen-injection clinic.

15:47.590 --> 15:48.800
You're going back
into the shoebox.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.700
It may not be pretty

15:50.760 --> 15:52.900
but damn it, it's honest.

15:55.770 --> 15:58.240
I, Lisa Simpson

15:58.300 --> 16:00.260
am hereby giving away

16:00.340 --> 16:04.510
<i>all my ill-gotten
Malibu Stacy accessories!</i>

16:04.580 --> 16:06.080
( <i>screaming )</i>

16:06.140 --> 16:07.300
Ahh!

16:10.880 --> 16:11.990
( <i>clamoring )</i>

16:16.520 --> 16:17.960
Look Lisa, I bought you

16:18.020 --> 16:19.920
a Malibu Stacy
chinchilla coat.

16:19.990 --> 16:21.300
- Ooh!
- Huh?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.330
So you've come to buy
my forgiveness.

16:23.390 --> 16:24.760
Sorry, Homer.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.300
Lisa, honey, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

16:27.370 --> 16:30.100
but I really had a good time
watching football with you

16:30.170 --> 16:33.410
and I think you had
a good time with me.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.240
Yeah, I did.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.910
We can still watch
the Super Bowl together

16:36.980 --> 16:39.280
can't we? Huh?

16:39.340 --> 16:40.570
( <i>both giggling )</i>

16:40.650 --> 16:43.850
Well, I would like to see
what the fuss is about.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.020
It's a date.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.480
So...

16:47.550 --> 16:48.220
Do you think the Redskins

16:48.290 --> 16:49.520
will beat the spread?

16:49.590 --> 16:51.590
Put me down.

16:51.660 --> 16:56.160
Look Dad, I'll tell you
who's going to win the Super
Bowl if you want me to,

16:56.230 --> 16:58.630
but it will just
validate my theory

16:58.700 --> 16:59.800
that you cared more
about winning money

16:59.860 --> 17:01.660
than you did about me.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.030
Okay.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.839
I think Washington
is a mortal lock.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.200
Washington!
Whoo-hoo!

17:07.270 --> 17:08.910
However...

17:08.970 --> 17:09.930
However?
What however?
What do you mean 'however'?

17:10.010 --> 17:11.109
However what?

17:11.180 --> 17:15.180
However, I may also be
so clouded with rage

17:15.250 --> 17:15.920
that subconsciously

17:15.980 --> 17:17.750
<i>I want you to lose.</i>

17:17.819 --> 17:20.790
In which case,
I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.

17:20.849 --> 17:23.190
Lisa, do me a favor.
Complete this sentence:

17:23.250 --> 17:25.550
Daddy should bet
all his money on...

17:25.619 --> 17:26.750
I don't know.

17:26.819 --> 17:27.520
Oh!

17:27.589 --> 17:29.130
If I still love you

17:29.190 --> 17:30.320
Washington.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.970
If I don't, Buffalo.

17:34.870 --> 17:39.710
Homer, I think that chip's
got enough dip on it.

Stupid!

17:57.090 --> 17:58.860
( <i>Jerry Lewis squealing )
<i>Sorry...</i></i>

17:58.920 --> 18:00.950
( <i>both laughing )</i>

18:01.030 --> 18:01.800
<i>Formidable.</i>

18:03.090 --> 18:06.720
( <i>Lisa playing
"Broken Neck Blues")</i>

18:10.300 --> 18:12.170
Oh, every note is
like a dagger in my heart.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.240
I got to get out of here.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.480
Moe's Tavern.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.740
Home of the Super Sunday
Brunch Spectacular.

18:17.810 --> 18:19.510
Ohh! Baloney.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.250
Bread!

18:21.310 --> 18:23.240
Got you down for 40 bucks.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.910
Good luck, your eminence.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.980
Sorry Homer, you can't take
any more of my money.

18:27.050 --> 18:29.620
I'm..... out
of the bookie business.

18:29.690 --> 18:31.490
But Moe,
you've been taking bets all...

18:31.560 --> 18:33.390
Barney, how 'bout a free beer.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.630
Wow!

18:34.690 --> 18:36.220
Don't worry, Moe,
I'm not betting.

18:36.290 --> 18:37.050
What?

18:37.130 --> 18:39.000
Give me that.
Aw.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.960
I had the greatest gift
of all--

18:41.030 --> 18:42.740
a little girl who
could pick football

18:42.800 --> 18:44.970
and I ruined it.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.980
<i>Well Sir, we're two hours
and 45 minutes through the
pregame show,</i>

18:48.040 --> 18:49.440

a special guest</i>

18:49.510 --> 18:50.840
<i>Actor Troy McClure</i>

18:50.910 --> 18:53.050

after the game!</i>

18:55.050 --> 18:56.250
<i>Thanks, Bret.</i>

18:56.310 --> 18:58.680
<i>My new show's called
Handle With Care.</i>

18:58.750 --> 19:00.690
<i>I play Jack Handle,
a retired cop</i>

19:00.750 --> 19:02.860
<i>who shares an apartment
with a retired criminal.</i>

19:02.920 --> 19:04.260
<i>We're the original Odd Couple.</i>

19:04.320 --> 19:05.960
<i>What made you want to do a
situation comedy?</i>

19:06.020 --> 19:09.220
<i>Well I fell in love
with the script, Bret.</i>

19:09.290 --> 19:11.360
<i>and my recent trouble
with the IRS sealed the deal.</i>

19:11.430 --> 19:12.530
<i>Great, great, Troy.</i>

19:12.600 --> 19:13.830
<i>Ooh! Looks like</i>

19:13.900 --> 19:15.940

19:16.000 --> 19:17.270
<i>Washington kicks.</i>

19:17.340 --> 19:19.240
<i>Oh, it's a bad kick,
way too short.</i>

19:19.300 --> 19:22.070
<i>Buffalo is going to start
with excellent field position.</i>

19:22.140 --> 19:23.240
Buffalo's going to win.

19:23.310 --> 19:24.480
Lisa hates me.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.910
What you got riding
on this game?

19:26.980 --> 19:28.150
My daughter.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.340
( <i>whistles )</i>

19:29.410 --> 19:30.440
What a gambler.

19:32.650 --> 19:36.520
<i>And with the score at the half
Buffalo 14, Washington 7</i>

19:36.590 --> 19:38.830
<i>it's time for the never-tedious
Super Bowl half time show.</i>

19:41.460 --> 19:45.100
<i>People of Earth, we've come
ten billion light-years</i>

20:00.210 --> 20:01.420
Oh, this sucks.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.420
Come on, snipers,
where are you?

20:03.480 --> 20:04.750
Bart, who's winning?

20:04.820 --> 20:06.320
You-hate-Dad is up
by a touchdown.

20:06.380 --> 20:07.410
( <i>sighing )</i>

20:07.490 --> 20:11.220
all:
Go! Go! Go! Go! <i>Yay!!</i>

20:11.290 --> 20:14.260
<i>Announcer:
It's a touchdown
for halfback Dan Beerdorf.</i>

20:14.330 --> 20:17.100
<i>Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl.</i>

20:19.900 --> 20:21.130
They wanted it more.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.300
Hey Homer, didn't you say
if Duff Dry wins

20:23.370 --> 20:24.340
your daughter loves you?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.840
Not Duff Dry,
Washington.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.430
Okay, okay, they're
both great teams.

20:28.510 --> 20:29.540
Yay!
Yay!

20:29.610 --> 20:30.980
Huh?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.780
<i>Touchdown, Redskins.</i>

20:32.840 --> 20:34.740
All right,
we're back in business.

20:36.910 --> 20:38.710
Well, I'm glad <i>some people</i>

20:38.780 --> 20:41.580
could resist the lures
of the big game.

20:41.650 --> 20:43.680
Oh my God!
I forgot the game!

20:43.750 --> 20:47.350
<i>So, with 3 ticks left on the
clock, it all comes down to
this one play.</i>

20:47.430 --> 20:49.900
<i>If Washington scores here,
happy fans will be looting</i>

20:49.960 --> 20:53.100
<i>and turning over cars in our
nation's capitol tonight.
Here's the handoff..</i>

20:53.160 --> 20:53.990
Please, please, please.

20:54.070 --> 20:55.840
<i>Touchdown!</i>

20:55.900 --> 20:57.270

20:57.340 --> 21:00.070
<i>The Washington Redskins
win Super Bowl 26!</i>

21:00.140 --> 21:01.240
I guess you love Dad.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.140
I suspected as much.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.750
Yes! She loves me,
she loves me.

21:05.810 --> 21:07.250
Why are you so
happy about, Homer?

21:07.310 --> 21:08.780
You didn't win any money.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.920
Money comes and money goes,
but what I have with my daughter

21:11.980 --> 21:14.440
can go on
for eight more years!

21:14.520 --> 21:17.820

21:26.860 --> 21:28.160
Isn't it, though?

21:28.230 --> 21:30.890
After I... catch my...
breath...

21:30.970 --> 21:35.280
can we...
go... home?
