00:01.226 --> 00:02.687
Previously on "Casual"...

00:02.781 --> 00:05.008
How's Dad? We should think
about what to do with his ashes.

00:05.033 --> 00:07.159
Maybe we should just
bury him in my backyard.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.786
Please join me in celebrating the life

00:08.787 --> 00:09.828
of Charles Cole.

00:09.829 --> 00:10.996
Oh, fuck that!

00:10.997 --> 00:12.331
She disappears without a word,

00:12.332 --> 00:14.333
and now she wants
to play grieving widow?

00:14.334 --> 00:16.085
"Please bring your father."

00:16.085 --> 00:17.503
She can't have his ashes,

00:17.504 --> 00:19.046
'cause we murdered him.

00:19.047 --> 00:20.172
We did the dirty work.

00:20.173 --> 00:21.465
She can't take that from us.

00:21.466 --> 00:22.758
Come gather 'round.

00:22.759 --> 00:24.468
You know, this is hard for me, too.

00:24.469 --> 00:26.887
Sometimes I just want to call
you and tell you everything,

00:26.888 --> 00:28.597
and then I remember that I shouldn't.

00:28.598 --> 00:30.015
Just because we don't live together

00:30.016 --> 00:31.934
doesn't mean we can't talk.

00:31.935 --> 00:34.603
Save my seat.

00:34.604 --> 00:36.272
I know Charles would have been overjoyed

00:36.273 --> 00:39.066
to see such a collection
of friends and family.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.902
Where are your shoes?

00:41.903 --> 00:43.737
Check your bag.

00:43.738 --> 00:47.366
You didn't.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.785
For him to take me in,

00:49.786 --> 00:53.706
a single, pregnant woman,

00:53.707 --> 00:56.208
and raise my daughter as his own,

00:56.209 --> 00:59.671
and for that our family
will be eternally grateful.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.440
Nope. No.

01:19.441 --> 01:22.026
- But...
- No.

01:22.027 --> 01:23.319
Fine.

01:28.074 --> 01:30.367
What do you think their deal is?

01:30.368 --> 01:33.954
What, two men of vastly different sizes

01:33.955 --> 01:36.373
and social experiences
can't play pool together?

01:36.374 --> 01:38.375
I think the shorter one
is the tall one's

01:38.376 --> 01:39.918
very lifelike marionette.

01:39.919 --> 01:41.337
Mm, that feels right.

01:41.338 --> 01:43.464
Ooh, here we go. Easy money.

01:43.465 --> 01:44.965
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:44.966 --> 01:47.259
- She's a shark.
- No way. How can you tell?

01:47.260 --> 01:50.179
Because look at the callus on her thumb.

01:50.180 --> 01:53.098
What? That could be from
guitar, video games,

01:53.099 --> 01:55.185
or erotic rope play.

01:56.436 --> 01:58.228
Whoa, did you... Did you just see...

01:58.229 --> 01:59.813
Did you see that? That was amazing.

01:59.814 --> 02:01.565
She just sunk two balls like...

02:01.566 --> 02:03.442
How long you gotta practice to do that?

02:03.443 --> 02:04.818
What do you think?

02:04.819 --> 02:06.320
Erotic rope play?

02:06.321 --> 02:08.989
Yeah, it's a hobby,
and you get a callus and...

02:08.990 --> 02:10.741
- Fuck off.
- Yeah.

02:10.741 --> 02:12.785
All right, here we go.

02:12.786 --> 02:15.079
- Eh.
- Eh? What eh?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.705
They're drunk, they're bad,

02:16.706 --> 02:18.832
they're properly proportioned,
they're perfect.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.584
All right, fine, you talk.

02:20.585 --> 02:24.088
I will. Hello.

02:24.089 --> 02:27.049
My sister and I were wondering
if you'd be interested

02:27.050 --> 02:31.095
in a little game
of two-on-two for stakes.

02:31.096 --> 02:34.098
- Yeah.
- What kinda stakes?

02:34.099 --> 02:36.308
Well, if you win,

02:36.309 --> 02:39.770
a round of drinks on me and...

02:39.771 --> 02:41.522
this is very exciting.

02:41.523 --> 02:43.649
47.

02:43.650 --> 02:47.277
- 67.
- $67.

02:47.278 --> 02:49.739
- And if you win?
- I get your shoes.

02:53.159 --> 02:54.493
No.

02:54.494 --> 02:56.078
- Okay.
- That's fair.

02:56.079 --> 02:58.497
- We tried.
- That was fair. Okay.

02:58.498 --> 03:01.500
We'll find better.

03:01.501 --> 03:04.044
- You know what was cool?
- What?

03:04.045 --> 03:06.672
Was in the Wild West,
if you didn't like your life,

03:06.673 --> 03:08.882
you just changed
your hat and your boots,

03:08.883 --> 03:11.301
and you'd ride to the next town

03:11.302 --> 03:14.513
and, bam, you're a whole new person.

03:14.514 --> 03:18.934
That feels slightly glamorized
and not reflective of reality,

03:18.935 --> 03:20.394
but okay.

03:20.395 --> 03:24.314
Okay, so you could be
enslaved or scalped or,

03:24.315 --> 03:27.025
I don't know, tortured in
some obscure historical way

03:27.026 --> 03:30.112
that I don't even know about, but...

03:30.113 --> 03:31.822
at least it was possible.

03:31.823 --> 03:34.284
And you think you can't do that now?

03:35.285 --> 03:37.411
Okay, maybe, maybe.

03:37.412 --> 03:40.122
You know, if you pay off
all your credit cards,

03:40.123 --> 03:42.374
erase your computer,

03:42.375 --> 03:44.585
buy a one-way ticket
to someplace far away.

03:44.586 --> 03:48.006
Yeah, I guess...
I guess maybe people do it.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.299
Yeah.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.383
Yeah?

03:51.384 --> 03:52.926
You can't erase it all.

03:52.927 --> 03:56.180
Think about it,
every purchase you've ever made,

03:56.181 --> 03:57.890
every picture you've ever shared,

03:57.891 --> 03:59.725
your messages, your comments.

03:59.726 --> 04:01.185
All these facts that are etched

04:01.186 --> 04:03.896
in this thing, this network,

04:03.897 --> 04:07.107
and barring some catastrophic failure,

04:07.108 --> 04:09.067
they'll follow you... I mean, follow us

04:09.068 --> 04:11.404
wherever we go, even after we die.

04:13.364 --> 04:14.656
Wow.

04:14.657 --> 04:16.658
Our Facebook profiles
are gonna outlive us.

04:16.659 --> 04:18.285
Yeah, that's why it's so important

04:18.286 --> 04:20.286
to like the right stuff.

04:20.288 --> 04:22.998
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.502
You don't smoke.

04:27.837 --> 04:30.672
Hey, there any chance you got a...

04:30.673 --> 04:32.466
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

04:32.467 --> 04:35.220
Thank you. Great, thanks.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.768
Thank you.

04:42.769 --> 04:44.645
This doesn't look right, does it?

04:44.646 --> 04:49.441
It's affected,
like I'm doing a thing, huh?

04:49.442 --> 04:51.443
I don't know.

04:51.444 --> 04:53.278
I never met you before.

04:53.279 --> 04:55.531
Maybe that's just how you look.

04:55.532 --> 04:57.533
This girl, Anne-Marie Ness,

04:57.534 --> 05:01.203
she starred in all the school plays.

05:01.204 --> 05:03.038
She smoked Merit Ultra Lights.

05:03.039 --> 05:04.540
Sometimes I'd go smoke with her.

05:04.541 --> 05:06.166
Like... like I just thought

05:06.167 --> 05:09.670
maybe her aura would rub off on me.

05:09.671 --> 05:11.672
She-she's in retail now.

05:11.673 --> 05:13.340
I work in retail.

05:13.341 --> 05:15.425
There's nothing wrong with retail.

05:15.426 --> 05:16.718
It's great.

05:20.388 --> 05:23.100
Everything okay?

05:23.435 --> 05:26.396
Yeah, right? Tell me about it.

05:27.522 --> 05:29.648
My fantasy baseball team sucks.

05:29.649 --> 05:31.024
Three of my pitchers are injured,

05:31.025 --> 05:32.234
my closer's got a dead arm.

05:32.235 --> 05:33.694
It's infuriating.

05:33.695 --> 05:35.404
And you do all this research, too.

05:35.405 --> 05:37.489
SABR, WAR. Who's undervalued?

05:37.490 --> 05:39.616
Who-who's primed and ready to break out?

05:39.617 --> 05:41.368
It's...

05:41.369 --> 05:44.037
It just really sucks to care, you know?

05:56.509 --> 05:57.843
Are you addicted now?

05:57.844 --> 05:59.177
Should we get some vapes?

05:59.178 --> 06:01.138
No, I'm gonna head home to Laura.

06:01.139 --> 06:02.764
- What? No.
- Yeah.

06:02.765 --> 06:05.434
I was kidding about the vapes.
Fuck vapes.

06:05.435 --> 06:08.020
Here.

06:08.021 --> 06:09.563
What am I supposed to do with this?

06:09.564 --> 06:11.690
Whatever you want.

06:11.691 --> 06:13.025
It's your dad.

06:13.026 --> 06:15.861
Hey.

06:15.862 --> 06:17.821
Sorry.

06:17.822 --> 06:20.950
Just a lot to deal with right now.

06:23.870 --> 06:26.747
Let's do a night out in Burbank.

06:26.748 --> 06:28.373
- No.
- Yes.

06:28.374 --> 06:29.499
Yes.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.876
This is where we came from.

06:30.877 --> 06:32.419
This is the land of our roots.

06:32.420 --> 06:33.962
Not a chance.

06:33.963 --> 06:36.590
Val, we could be
anywhere in the world right now.

06:36.591 --> 06:39.384
Seoul, Vienna, Rio.

06:39.385 --> 06:40.886
Fuck, I wish it was Rio.

06:40.887 --> 06:44.431
But we're here, in Burbank, with him,

06:44.432 --> 06:46.391
so let's see it one last time

06:46.392 --> 06:49.770
and spread his ashes and be free.

06:49.771 --> 06:51.396
Please.

06:51.397 --> 06:54.066
No, nothing good happens in Burbank.

06:54.067 --> 06:56.860
I know, that's why you can't
make me do this alone.

07:00.948 --> 07:02.908
- God, I hate you.
- Good.

07:02.909 --> 07:05.118
Put that in your purse and let's go.

07:05.382 --> 07:07.038
Can we get a check?

07:12.937 --> 07:15.725
This has to be
a health code violation, right?

07:15.922 --> 07:17.255
If an inspector comes,

07:17.256 --> 07:19.257
just say it's a bag of powdered sugar.

07:19.258 --> 07:21.009
Do you think they'll buy it?

07:21.010 --> 07:23.595
Honestly, I think this
whole hypothetical situation

07:23.596 --> 07:25.347
is pretty unlikely.

07:25.348 --> 07:28.058
Oh, my God.

07:28.059 --> 07:30.435
This is so good.

07:31.938 --> 07:33.772
How many are you gonna eat?

07:33.773 --> 07:35.691
I'm gonna eat all of them.

07:35.692 --> 07:38.652
Dad would be proud.

07:38.653 --> 07:41.530
Dad was a selfish asshole

07:41.531 --> 07:43.281
who also had diabetes.

07:43.282 --> 07:46.119
That never stopped him
from enjoying a donut.

07:47.954 --> 07:49.538
Until now.

07:49.539 --> 07:51.248
- Hey.
- Hmm?

07:51.249 --> 07:53.792
Don't rush him. Let him savor it.

07:53.793 --> 07:55.335
- Alex.
- Hmm?

07:55.336 --> 07:57.505
- Eat the fucking donut.
- Mm.

08:01.634 --> 08:03.760
I remember looking at this display case

08:03.761 --> 08:04.928
when we were kids.

08:04.929 --> 08:06.972
All the colors and sprinkles,

08:06.973 --> 08:10.142
and then I'd look at myself and think,

08:10.143 --> 08:13.145
what in the fuck is wrong with you?

08:13.146 --> 08:16.314
Why can't you stop?

08:16.315 --> 08:17.816
But you did stop.

08:17.817 --> 08:19.985
I was really fat.

08:21.821 --> 08:23.572
You...

08:23.573 --> 08:26.366
You used to clip the doorway
when you'd enter a room.

08:26.367 --> 08:27.784
Okay.

08:27.785 --> 08:30.662
Like you couldn't
totally navigate yourself.

08:30.663 --> 08:33.414
There's something really demoralizing

08:33.416 --> 08:35.250
about not having control over your body.

08:35.251 --> 08:39.504
It's like living with constant
waking sleep paralysis.

08:39.505 --> 08:41.047
Fuck.

08:41.048 --> 08:42.506
That sounds scary.

08:42.508 --> 08:45.260
It was.

08:47.513 --> 08:49.639
But I guess that's
what it's like, right?

08:49.640 --> 08:51.183
You know, when you're a kid.

08:51.184 --> 08:54.227
Plus on top of that,
you're just so terrified

08:54.228 --> 08:56.606
of all the things you don't know.

08:58.649 --> 09:01.068
I can't imagine you being
terrified of anything.

09:04.697 --> 09:07.240
Oh, that's funny. You're funny.

09:07.241 --> 09:09.576
Okay, what are you afraid of?

09:09.577 --> 09:11.536
- No, no.
- No?

09:11.537 --> 09:14.247
I spend every day dealing
with other people's fears

09:14.248 --> 09:17.084
just so I don't have
to deal with my own.

09:17.085 --> 09:20.212
It's perks of the job.

09:20.213 --> 09:21.713
Fine.

09:21.714 --> 09:23.256
Let's go.

09:23.257 --> 09:24.424
Let's go where?

09:24.425 --> 09:25.801
It's a surprise.

09:25.802 --> 09:29.429
Ugh, no. Alex, I'm tired.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.889
Oh, my God, we're on Memory Lane,

09:30.890 --> 09:32.432
and you want to go to sleep?

09:32.433 --> 09:34.142
You can sleep every night
for the rest of your life.

09:34.143 --> 09:36.854
Come take a walk with me.

09:42.902 --> 09:44.319
Fine.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.696
Call a car.

09:46.697 --> 09:49.117

♪ All night ♪

10:30.296 --> 10:32.905
We're not breaking and entering, are we?

10:33.397 --> 10:35.680
We are. Aren't we?

10:35.705 --> 10:36.788
- Alex?
- Hush.

10:36.789 --> 10:38.540
- Alex, can we not?
- Shh.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.713
- We're not.
- Oh.

10:56.976 --> 10:59.644
- Yeah, I see it.
- I know.

10:59.645 --> 11:02.440
God, I was cute.

11:31.010 --> 11:33.845
It all looks so small from back here.

11:33.846 --> 11:37.140
Back there, it felt so big.

11:37.141 --> 11:40.018
The costumes and the sets,

11:40.019 --> 11:41.561
and even the makeup.

11:41.562 --> 11:45.148
I just can't imagine what it
felt like on that stage.

11:45.149 --> 11:47.484
What do you mean? You were onstage.

11:47.485 --> 11:49.027
Me? No, no.

11:49.028 --> 11:50.487
I was always running around the back.

11:50.488 --> 11:52.322
Little gopher with the frizzy hair.

11:52.323 --> 11:53.698
- No.
- Yeah.

11:53.699 --> 11:55.408
What about "Pippin"?
You were in that one.

11:55.409 --> 11:57.452
Uh, I was Peasant Number Two.

11:57.453 --> 11:58.870
And you owned that role.

11:58.871 --> 12:01.040
You ran circles around
Peasant Number One.

12:02.708 --> 12:04.876
- Did you see that?
- Damn right I saw it.

12:04.877 --> 12:07.338
- Aww.
- Multiple times.

12:11.050 --> 12:13.551
Dad never did.

12:13.552 --> 12:15.553
We could leave him right here.

12:15.554 --> 12:17.138
On the seat.

12:17.139 --> 12:21.977
Make him watch bad musical
theater for the rest of time.

12:21.978 --> 12:24.480
Oh, I'm not that cruel.

12:30.987 --> 12:33.571
Besides, it wasn't all bad.

12:33.572 --> 12:35.156
See, there's this little catwalk,

12:35.157 --> 12:38.076
it's right up there,
and when you stand on it

12:38.077 --> 12:41.246
you can see the stage and
the audience at the same time.

12:41.247 --> 12:43.748
It's like two worlds at once.

12:43.749 --> 12:44.791
Hmm.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.501
I really...

12:46.502 --> 12:48.962
I really liked that spot.

13:26.917 --> 13:28.586
It's nice.

13:40.890 --> 13:43.161
Hey, what's it like being a mom?

13:44.810 --> 13:46.887
It's like...

13:47.605 --> 13:50.982
watching yourself go
through life a second time,

13:50.983 --> 13:53.318
only this time you're just a voice,

13:53.319 --> 13:56.863
and you never know if anyone
is ever listening to you.

13:56.864 --> 13:59.157
Oh, Laura listens to you.

13:59.158 --> 14:03.078
Yeah, sometimes I wonder if she should.

14:03.079 --> 14:06.998
She appreciates what you do for her.

14:06.999 --> 14:09.459
Well...

14:09.460 --> 14:12.003
she'll be off on her own soon enough.

14:12.004 --> 14:13.129
Yeah.

14:13.130 --> 14:15.256
Then what are you gonna do?

14:18.135 --> 14:20.845
I-I don't know.

14:20.846 --> 14:22.514
Really, I don't...

14:22.515 --> 14:24.349
I don't know what's
supposed to come next.

14:24.350 --> 14:25.767
What's it say in the handbook?

14:25.768 --> 14:27.185
The... oh, the handbook?

14:27.186 --> 14:29.479
The one that they...

14:29.480 --> 14:31.523
the one they send to you
when you have a kid?

14:31.524 --> 14:33.024
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

14:33.025 --> 14:37.028
Just, um... I think
it got lost in the mail.

14:37.029 --> 14:40.031
I was between apartments.

14:40.032 --> 14:41.908
It was before Amazon Prime.

14:41.909 --> 14:44.202
You can do anything, you know?

14:44.203 --> 14:46.579
You just decide, and then you do it.

14:47.748 --> 14:50.542
What if...

14:50.543 --> 14:54.045
what if I try things,

14:54.046 --> 14:55.922
and it just doesn't feel right?

14:55.923 --> 14:57.590
I mean, what if, like, these hobbies,

14:57.591 --> 14:59.843
or whatever they are, what if I just...

14:59.844 --> 15:03.346
what if they're just
diversions to pass the time

15:03.347 --> 15:05.056
until I'm dead?

15:05.057 --> 15:08.226
Oh, then you'll just feel
like the rest of us.

15:13.315 --> 15:15.567
You don't have to stay.

15:15.568 --> 15:18.195
I can take care of this.

15:20.030 --> 15:22.741
Maybe bake him into a pie.

15:24.994 --> 15:27.245
I want to go home.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.799
Who do you think he is?

15:39.800 --> 15:44.304
I mean, we have no idea.
He could be anyone.

15:44.305 --> 15:46.514
A musician.

15:46.515 --> 15:49.601
A professional athlete.

15:49.602 --> 15:52.563
Think you'd be less clumsy.

15:55.357 --> 15:57.275
I'm his daughter.

15:57.276 --> 15:59.527
I'm half his,

15:59.528 --> 16:02.071
and I don't know
the first thing about him.

16:02.072 --> 16:04.867
Val, what does it matter?

16:06.994 --> 16:09.787
Just like grew up in this house where...

16:09.788 --> 16:13.291
where my dad...

16:13.292 --> 16:16.961
Charles, I don't know,

16:16.962 --> 16:18.713
he must have looked at me

16:18.714 --> 16:21.341
and seen some... some alien,

16:21.342 --> 16:22.550
some foreigner.

16:22.551 --> 16:24.344
No wonder he was never affectionate.

16:24.345 --> 16:26.012
It would probably, you know,

16:26.013 --> 16:29.058
remind him of a past
he couldn't control.

16:35.397 --> 16:37.232
Maybe my life would be different

16:37.233 --> 16:40.236
if I was with someone who wanted me.

16:41.820 --> 16:44.155
Who, your biological father?

16:44.156 --> 16:46.324
The guy who never showed up?

16:46.325 --> 16:48.368
We don't know that.

16:48.369 --> 16:51.955
We don't know that.

16:51.956 --> 16:54.332
Okay.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.668
I get it.

16:56.669 --> 17:00.713
Anyone sounds better than Charles.

17:00.714 --> 17:03.174
But look at you.

17:03.175 --> 17:05.761
Look what you became.

17:08.263 --> 17:09.263
Yeah.

17:09.265 --> 17:12.224
I don't know what I am.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.352
I don't know who I'm supposed to be.

17:14.353 --> 17:16.854
You asked me, what am I most afraid of?

17:16.855 --> 17:18.856
That. That's it, that.

17:18.857 --> 17:20.233
You know, I'm 40 years old,

17:20.233 --> 17:22.527
and you have this idea of yourself,

17:22.528 --> 17:24.404
this picture, and in one moment

17:24.405 --> 17:26.906
it's just like...

17:26.906 --> 17:29.075
it just totally changes.

17:29.076 --> 17:31.369
- No, it doesn't.
- Alex!

17:31.370 --> 17:33.997
You're the same person
you've always been.

17:33.998 --> 17:36.874
The frizzy-haired girl
who writes her name on the wall.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.585
You're a good mom

17:38.586 --> 17:40.044
and a good sister,

17:40.045 --> 17:43.047
and, sure, there may be
some girl out there

17:43.048 --> 17:46.384
that that guy raised, but...

17:46.385 --> 17:48.970
I don't want to know her.

17:53.517 --> 17:55.102
Home sweet home.

18:00.107 --> 18:02.734
I half expected it to be gone.

18:02.735 --> 18:08.240
Some gaping hole
that ends God-knows-where.

18:09.617 --> 18:13.161
They planted trees. Hm.

18:13.162 --> 18:15.456
Do you think we should
try to get inside?

18:18.250 --> 18:21.336
Do you... do you really believe that,

18:21.337 --> 18:22.670
that it doesn't matter?

18:22.671 --> 18:25.798
That I'm still the same?

18:25.799 --> 18:28.134
I know you are.

18:33.974 --> 18:36.434
So that's our house, huh?

18:36.435 --> 18:38.437
It was.

18:40.397 --> 18:42.940
It was such a shithole.

18:42.941 --> 18:45.485
Now it's so nice.

18:45.486 --> 18:47.613
Nicest flophouse in Burbank.

18:51.241 --> 18:54.577
Maybe we should just
give the ashes back to Mom.

18:54.578 --> 18:57.288
Let her deal with them.

18:57.289 --> 18:59.624
Why give her the satisfaction?

19:02.378 --> 19:04.463
Oh.

19:24.733 --> 19:26.150
How's this?

19:26.151 --> 19:27.694
Fine by me.

19:27.695 --> 19:31.656
Sure you don't want
to go back to the Donut Hut?

19:31.657 --> 19:33.241
Nah.

19:33.242 --> 19:36.370
We'll let the wind decide.

19:52.886 --> 19:56.180
Should we say something?

19:56.181 --> 19:58.142
Yeah, I think we should.

20:04.481 --> 20:06.566
You first.

20:06.567 --> 20:08.234
What? Really?

20:08.235 --> 20:09.944
Yeah, I gave the wedding speech.

20:09.945 --> 20:12.405
Yes, you did do that.

20:12.406 --> 20:13.740
Sellout.

20:13.741 --> 20:15.783
Wasn't that the night
you had sex with my...

20:15.784 --> 20:17.660
Okay, fine.

20:17.661 --> 20:19.663
Charles.

20:24.084 --> 20:27.336
Dad.

20:27.337 --> 20:30.882
Uh...

20:30.883 --> 20:34.177
You were very...

20:34.178 --> 20:36.554
untraditional,

20:36.555 --> 20:38.431
um...

20:38.432 --> 20:39.891
selfish,

20:39.892 --> 20:41.225
probably negligent.

20:41.226 --> 20:42.393
Definitely negligent.

20:42.394 --> 20:43.770
Larger than life.

20:43.771 --> 20:45.271
Planetary, really.

20:45.272 --> 20:47.482
Yeah, like a big black hole,

20:47.483 --> 20:50.735
just capable of sucking all the light

20:50.736 --> 20:52.445
and banishing it to another...

20:52.446 --> 20:54.822
Okay, I think we're going
a little off the rails here.

20:54.823 --> 20:57.493
Right, sorry.

21:04.249 --> 21:07.252
You were less than perfect.

21:09.755 --> 21:12.882
I spent many a night

21:12.883 --> 21:15.886
asking myself what I did to deserve you.

21:20.557 --> 21:25.019
But you were there, ultimately.

21:25.020 --> 21:30.691
In whatever small capacity,

21:30.692 --> 21:32.736
you were there.

21:36.615 --> 21:39.618
And I'm... and I'm grateful for that.

21:44.790 --> 21:46.707
Not a ton to add.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.835
Um...

21:48.836 --> 21:51.629
Obviously I would prefer
if you didn't haunt me,

21:51.630 --> 21:57.468
so, um, if you do go the ghost route,

21:57.469 --> 22:00.137
hopefully you'll do that
somewhere far away from me.

22:00.138 --> 22:02.224
- Like Burbank.
- Yeah, Burbank works.

22:06.103 --> 22:08.187
Um...

22:08.188 --> 22:11.190
you were not great.

22:11.191 --> 22:13.985
Really.

22:13.986 --> 22:15.820
Not great at all.

22:15.821 --> 22:19.907
I don't know if
anyone's parents are great,

22:19.908 --> 22:22.452
but you seemed especially bad.

22:24.121 --> 22:26.582
I don't know.

22:29.710 --> 22:32.003
I, um, resented you

22:32.004 --> 22:34.047
for a long time.

22:37.175 --> 22:39.594
Um...

22:39.595 --> 22:42.264
But now I don't.

22:48.937 --> 22:51.022
Um...

22:51.023 --> 22:53.441
Maybe it's 'cause time heals all wounds,

22:53.442 --> 22:57.988
or, you know, it dulls memories.

23:00.198 --> 23:03.200
Or maybe it, um, just makes you realize

23:03.201 --> 23:06.204
how useless it is to hold on to grudges.

23:08.206 --> 23:10.750
How much energy

23:10.751 --> 23:13.503
it takes to hate.

23:16.214 --> 23:20.092
So, Dad...

23:20.093 --> 23:22.929
I don't hate you,

23:22.930 --> 23:26.975
and I hope you find your peace.

23:30.062 --> 23:32.355
That's it.

23:32.356 --> 23:35.108
- That's it.
- Okay.

23:39.279 --> 23:40.780
Want me to hold it?

23:40.781 --> 23:42.824
I got it.

25:13.790 --> 25:17.501
Going for an Indiana Jones
type of thing.

25:17.502 --> 25:19.837
"Raiders."

25:19.838 --> 25:22.214
You know, the idol for the bag of sand.

25:22.215 --> 25:24.633
The old switcheroo.

25:24.634 --> 25:27.888
Then with the rolling ball
and... whatever.

25:31.850 --> 25:33.601
It was unkind,

25:33.602 --> 25:35.936
what you did to Valerie.

25:35.937 --> 25:39.356
Telling her like that
in front of all those people.

25:39.357 --> 25:42.318
Do you ever get tired
of speaking for your sister?

25:42.319 --> 25:45.029
I don't speak for her.

25:45.030 --> 25:47.573
But I feel like we've
had this conversation before,

25:47.574 --> 25:50.035
many times now.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.372
I don't know if you're lonely.

25:55.373 --> 25:57.541
I assume you must be.

25:57.542 --> 25:59.794
But telling her about some secret father

25:59.795 --> 26:02.880
isn't gonna bring her back to you.

26:02.881 --> 26:05.382
Not just a father.

26:05.383 --> 26:07.885
A brother, too.

26:07.886 --> 26:11.264
A half-brother just like you.

26:15.811 --> 26:18.646
We spread Dad's ashes.

26:18.647 --> 26:21.982
Together.

26:21.983 --> 26:24.820
He would have probably enjoyed that.

26:26.238 --> 26:28.532
Good-bye, Mom.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.396
Hey, it's me.

27:27.139 --> 27:29.265
Yeah, yeah, I had fun last night, too.

27:34.048 --> 27:35.881
Oh, no reason.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.935
Um...

27:40.238 --> 27:42.294
Oh, yeah.

27:42.454 --> 27:43.803
I love you, too.
