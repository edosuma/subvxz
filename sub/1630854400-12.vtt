00:05.309 --> 00:07.224

I'm a little surprised

00:07.268 --> 00:08.312
to see you back here, Dwayne.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.618
- I'm also back here.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.099
- Less surprising
for whatever reason.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.362
- You know, we were
on our way to the plane,

00:14.405 --> 00:16.494
and I started to think
about what you were telling me

00:16.538 --> 00:18.235
about your family.
- Sorry to intrude,

00:18.279 --> 00:20.846
but Bibi Storrs has arrived.
- Bibi Storrs?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.718
- Hey!

00:22.761 --> 00:25.373
Thanks so much for having me.
I had a great flight.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.201
I turned on "Hussies"
and went straight so sleep.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.507
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.248
- I'm just wrapping up here.
I'll be with you in one moment.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.509
- Oh, no problem at all.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.251
Hey, Randall.
Is that Dwayne Johnson?

00:34.295 --> 00:35.731
Bibi Storrs.
- Bibi--

00:35.774 --> 00:37.037

of great things about you.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.386
- Oh, you may not realize this,

00:38.429 --> 00:39.909
but you just met
your new best friend.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.171
- Hey, best friend.
- Oh, hey!

00:41.215 --> 00:42.607

- Okay, I'll show you
to your room.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.175
- Kay, thank you so much.
- She is the host

00:45.219 --> 00:46.655
of my favorite morning show.

00:46.698 --> 00:49.266
She's actually my favorite star
after you, Dwayne.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.354
- Ah.
[laughter]

00:50.398 --> 00:51.660
Thank you.
- Yeah, my guess is

00:51.703 --> 00:53.531
that Taft sent her
here as a backup,

00:53.575 --> 00:55.098

get that trade deal done.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.143
- Ah...
- We cohost

00:56.186 --> 00:57.318
the same morning show.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.884
- "Chatterbox"?
[scoffs] No.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.234
[laughs]
- Yes, it's called

01:00.277 --> 01:03.106
"Chatterbox with Randall Park
and Bibi Storrs."

01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I mean, that sounds

01:04.629 --> 01:05.978
like a fun show.
I gotta watch it.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.023
[laughter]
- I'm sorry--

01:07.067 --> 01:09.373
so you were saying
about my family?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.940
- Yes, so I was thinking

01:10.983 --> 01:12.550
about what you were telling me
about your family

01:12.594 --> 01:13.943
and the legacy
of their business,

01:13.986 --> 01:16.902
and it very much so reminded me
of my own family,

01:16.946 --> 01:19.514
particularly a time
when we were living in Hawaii.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.993
After months of fighting,

01:21.037 --> 01:22.908
my mom and dad had
put their frustrations

01:22.952 --> 01:24.562
with Lars Anderson aside

01:24.606 --> 01:26.956
and settled their issues
with my grandmother.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.262
But the fans never knew that.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.741
- This is a great illustration

01:29.785 --> 01:31.526
of the different kind
of bodies

01:31.569 --> 01:33.745
that can succeed
in pro wrestling.

PPPW and WPW

02:16.788 --> 02:19.400
were now working together
to build a rivalry storyline

02:19.443 --> 02:21.619

for something big:

02:21.663 --> 02:23.534
a Peter Maivia tribute show.

your 30 seconds.

Wrestling only needs two guys

You're not supposed
to play with knives.

touching knives for?

to eat more fruit.

bananas, oranges.

Yeah, I will.

Um, so we have
a big wrestling show coming up

05:20.232 --> 05:22.365
out here in Hawaii,
and I know it's a long shot,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.411

if Cyndi would maybe--

05:24.454 --> 05:25.673

05:25.716 --> 05:27.370
I'll patch you through
to Cyndi right now.

Just like that?

I'm on a little bit of thin ice

05:32.027 --> 05:34.246
with her at the mo'.
I took my gatekeeping

05:34.290 --> 05:35.987
too seriously, and I hung up

05:36.031 --> 05:38.903
on the president of a major
motion picture studio.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.558
Anyway, long story short,
Cyndi Lauper will not be

06:35.090 --> 06:37.353
You know, I could throw
Jan Hooks into this deal.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.790
She could use a little sun.
Hmm?

a few important things

this old man had to set
his ego aside for this one.

to the main event

16:21.632 --> 16:23.504
without talking to me.
- I made a business decision

16:23.547 --> 16:24.679
when you were off playing

16:24.722 --> 16:25.941
"Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous"

16:25.985 --> 16:27.856
with Cyndi Lauper.
- More like Lars

16:27.899 --> 16:29.379
looking out for Lars.
- It's the wrong ending

16:29.423 --> 16:30.554
for a tribute show.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.600
They wanna see
a feel-good story.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.602
They want the good guy
to beat the bad guy,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.038
simple as that.
- Oh, we can do that

16:36.082 --> 16:37.213
right here, right now.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.171
- I'm fine with all that.
- Oh, are you?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.260
- Stop!

16:40.303 --> 16:41.435
This fighting is unbecoming

16:41.478 --> 16:43.524
of a night dedicated
to High Chief.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.395
Get your panties
out of bunches.

16:45.439 --> 16:49.051
It is time
for Peter's ceremony.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.183
Now!

16:50.226 --> 16:53.360
- And now a tribute to the life

16:53.403 --> 16:56.189
and legacy of Peter Maivia.

16:56.232 --> 16:59.018
- What started as a great
night for me ended up here:

16:59.061 --> 17:01.498
all of us sad,

17:01.542 --> 17:03.196
mad,

17:03.239 --> 17:04.848
and ashamed

17:04.893 --> 17:07.156
in front of everybody.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.073
Yup, that really happened,

17:11.117 --> 17:12.683
and those were my pants.

17:12.727 --> 17:17.079
- Please rise
for a ten-bell salute to honor

17:17.123 --> 17:18.385
the High Chief.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.605
[bell dinging]

17:24.304 --> 17:25.740
- Seeing how much
my grandfather meant

17:25.782 --> 17:27.220
to all of these guys...

17:27.262 --> 17:28.395
[bell dinging]

17:28.438 --> 17:30.919
To my family...

17:30.962 --> 17:33.443
I couldn't have felt worse
that I had ruined his night.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.054
[bell dings]

17:35.097 --> 17:37.491
- And here we are, folks,
the main event.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.754
One of these gladiators
will bring home

17:39.797 --> 17:42.757
Peter Maivia's
championship belt.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.976
- I'm sorry
I tried to fight Lars.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.023
- It wasn't
the right thing to do,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.677
but believe me,

17:49.720 --> 17:51.853
I understand why you did it.

17:51.896 --> 17:55.770
- Him disrespecting Grandpa
like that just made me so mad.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.946
I wasn't even thinking.
I just--

17:57.989 --> 17:59.513
I don't know.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.776
- Son, you don't think I wanna
fight people all the time?

18:01.819 --> 18:03.169
With these jackhammers
for arms,

18:03.212 --> 18:04.692
I can knock out
every Tom, Dick, and Harry

18:04.735 --> 18:06.520
that pisses me off,
but I don't.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.130
You know why?
- Lawsuits?

18:08.174 --> 18:09.479
- Yes, lawsuits,

18:09.523 --> 18:11.699
but also, part
of being an adult

18:11.742 --> 18:15.050
is setting ego aside,
keeping your cool.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.095
- Right.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.706
- Another part
of being an adult:

18:18.749 --> 18:20.316
don't fight guys
a hundred pounds

18:20.360 --> 18:21.796
above your weight class.

18:21.839 --> 18:22.971
- [scoffs]
I would've had him.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.320
- [scoffs]
No, absolutely not.

18:24.364 --> 18:25.930
I would've been checking you
out of the hospital.

18:25.974 --> 18:29.064
- What?
- [laughs]

18:29.108 --> 18:30.892
- A vicious clothesline!

18:30.935 --> 18:33.373
He's going in for the pin.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.896
One, two,

18:34.939 --> 18:37.290
three.
[bell rings]

18:37.333 --> 18:42.295
And still Polynesian Pacific
Pro Wrestling Champion,

18:42.338 --> 18:46.255
Lars Anderson!

18:46.299 --> 18:49.171
[crowd shouting "Lars"]

18:51.869 --> 18:52.914
- All I wanted to do
was protect

18:52.957 --> 18:54.655
my grandfather's legacy,

18:54.698 --> 18:56.309
but there was nothing
I could do.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.701
- Lars! Lars!

18:57.745 --> 18:59.138
- How is
everyone's night going?

18:59.181 --> 19:00.226
- You got
what you wanted, Lars.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.618
Don't rub it in.

19:01.662 --> 19:02.619
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.447
- Enough.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.885
All this time, you still
don't understand our business.

19:07.929 --> 19:11.193
It doesn't matter
who Peter's belt is on.

19:11.237 --> 19:14.631
We put it on who we want,
when we want.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.678
- She's right.
It's just business.

19:17.721 --> 19:21.377
- And we take it off
who we want,

19:21.421 --> 19:22.378
when we want.

19:22.422 --> 19:25.816
[dramatic music]

19:25.860 --> 19:27.209
You're right, Lah.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.689
It is just business,

19:28.732 --> 19:30.256
but it's family business.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.693
Next time you want
to change the finish,

19:32.736 --> 19:33.998
you talk to us.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.522
- What do you mean?
I'm the booker.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.697
I make the decisions.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.351
- Not anymore.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.179
Ata decides now.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.268
[rock music]

19:42.311 --> 19:45.184
Now, if you'll excuse us,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.708
I'm going to celebrate
this great night

19:47.751 --> 19:49.492
the way Peter would've wanted:

19:49.536 --> 19:51.668
with family

19:51.712 --> 19:54.236
at Ruth's Chris Steak House.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.674
♪

19:57.718 --> 19:59.894
If Peter was in your shoes,

19:59.937 --> 20:01.765
he would've done
the same thing.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.029
Wouldn't you, High Chief?

20:05.073 --> 20:07.380
- Turns out protecting
Peter's legacy

20:07.423 --> 20:08.946
united the whole family.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.948
But though the show was
a success,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.341
my family's
wrestling promotion

20:12.385 --> 20:13.734
never got back on its feet,

20:13.777 --> 20:15.257
and instead of capitalizing

20:15.301 --> 20:18.086
on the wrestling boom
of the mid-'80s,

20:18.129 --> 20:20.088
we took a financial hit
we never recovered from,

20:20.131 --> 20:22.873
which brings me right back
to you and your family

20:22.917 --> 20:25.920
and your country's
coffee legacy.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.748
Prime Minister,
you and your country

20:27.791 --> 20:29.358
now have all the leverage,

20:29.402 --> 20:31.926
and if there's anything that
you've taken from my story,

20:31.969 --> 20:34.189
it's that if you don't strike
while the iron's hot,

20:34.233 --> 20:38.237
then the moment
can pass you by.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.371
What if we imported
the Gjelgjiughm coffee method

20:42.415 --> 20:44.504
to the United States?
- Yes, but Dwayne,

20:44.547 --> 20:46.419
the method is very complex.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.465
- That's why you'll send us
a select group of emissaries

20:49.509 --> 20:51.119
who will oversee the growing.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.425
In exchange
for the stewardship,

20:52.468 --> 20:54.862
Gjelgjiughm will receive
a percentage of profit

20:54.905 --> 20:56.603
for every coffee crop.

20:56.646 --> 21:00.433
[dramatic music]

can reconvene in the morning?

- Hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for my robe.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.007
- Oh...
- It is the best robe

21:10.051 --> 21:11.574
I have ever put on my body.

- [laughs]
- Go ahead.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.011
Touch my sleeve.
- I don't need to touch

21:14.055 --> 21:16.318
your robe, because
I also have a robe, Bibi!

21:16.362 --> 21:19.365
