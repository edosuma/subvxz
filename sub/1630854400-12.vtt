WEBVTT

00:04.917 --> 00:05.266
.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.224
- I have to say,
I'm a little surprised

00:07.268 --> 00:08.312
to see you back here, Dwayne.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.618
- I'm also back here.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.099
- Less surprising
for whatever reason.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.362
- You know, we were
on our way to the plane,

00:14.405 --> 00:16.494
and I started to think
about what you were telling me

00:16.538 --> 00:18.235
about your family.
- Sorry to intrude,

00:18.279 --> 00:20.846
but Bibi Storrs has arrived.
- Bibi Storrs?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.718
- Hey!

00:22.761 --> 00:25.373
Thanks so much for having me.
I had a great flight.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.201
I turned on "Hussies"
and went straight so sleep.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.507
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.248
- I'm just wrapping up here.
I'll be with you in one moment.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.509
- Oh, no problem at all.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.251
Hey, Randall.
Is that Dwayne Johnson?

00:34.295 --> 00:35.731
Bibi Storrs.
- Bibi--

00:35.774 --> 00:37.037
hear a lot
of great things about you.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.386
- Oh, you may not realize this,

00:38.429 --> 00:39.909
but you just met
your new best friend.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.171
- Hey, best friend.
- Oh, hey!

00:41.215 --> 00:42.607
[laughter]

00:42.651 --> 00:43.826
- Okay, I'll show you
to your room.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.175
- Kay, thank you so much.
- She is the host

00:45.219 --> 00:46.655
of my favorite morning show.

00:46.698 --> 00:49.266
She's actually my favorite star
after you, Dwayne.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.354
- Ah.
[laughter]

00:50.398 --> 00:51.660
Thank you.
- Yeah, my guess is

00:51.703 --> 00:53.531
that Taft sent her
here as a backup,

00:53.575 --> 00:55.098
you know, and try to
get that trade deal done.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.143
- Ah...
- We cohost

00:56.186 --> 00:57.318
the same morning show.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.884
- "Chatterbox"?
[scoffs] No.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.234
[laughs]
- Yes, it's called

01:00.277 --> 01:03.106
"Chatterbox with Randall Park
and Bibi Storrs."

01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I mean, that sounds

01:04.629 --> 01:05.978
like a fun show.
I gotta watch it.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.023
[laughter]
- I'm sorry--

01:07.067 --> 01:09.373
so you were saying
about my family?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.940
- Yes, so I was thinking

01:10.983 --> 01:12.550
about what you were telling me
about your family

01:12.594 --> 01:13.943
and the legacy
of their business,

01:13.986 --> 01:16.902
and it very much so reminded me
of my own family,

01:16.946 --> 01:19.514
particularly a time
when we were living in Hawaii.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.993
After months of fighting,

01:21.037 --> 01:22.908
my mom and dad had
put their frustrations

01:22.952 --> 01:24.562
with Lars Anderson aside

01:24.606 --> 01:26.956
and settled their issues
with my grandmother.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.262
But the fans never knew that.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.741
- This is a great illustration

01:29.785 --> 01:31.526
of the different kind
of bodies

01:31.569 --> 01:33.745
that can succeed
in pro wrestling.

01:33.789 --> 01:37.662
- Macho Man vs.
the everyman, Lars Anderson.

01:37.706 --> 01:40.622
[crowd shouting]

01:42.058 --> 01:44.365
But wait--but that's

01:44.408 --> 01:46.235
Rocky Johnson
and Jake "The Snake"!

01:46.280 --> 01:47.759
They're WPW wrestlers.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.239
They're not allowed
to be here!

01:49.283 --> 01:52.199
- Make no mistake,
this is an invasion,

01:52.241 --> 01:54.288
an unprecedented
security breach!

01:54.331 --> 01:56.158
- I have never seen
anything like this

01:56.203 --> 01:58.118
in all my years
of pro wrestling!

01:58.161 --> 02:00.772
[electronic music]

02:00.816 --> 02:03.166
- No, Jake!
No, no, put the snake away!

02:03.210 --> 02:04.602
[both grunt]

02:04.646 --> 02:06.082
- That's what
I'm talking about!

02:06.126 --> 02:09.259
â™ª

02:09.303 --> 02:12.393
This is WPW's house now!

02:12.436 --> 02:14.046
- That whole invasion?

02:14.090 --> 02:16.745
Staged.
PPPW and WPW

02:16.788 --> 02:19.400
were now working together
to build a rivalry storyline

02:19.443 --> 02:21.619
to drum up excitement
for something big:

02:21.663 --> 02:23.534
a Peter Maivia tribute show.

02:23.578 --> 02:24.753
- And to sell the rivalry,

02:24.796 --> 02:26.276
we give every single match
big stakes.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.018
PPPW wrestlers face off
against WPW wrestlers

02:29.061 --> 02:31.760
for island supremacy:
seven matches, seven victors.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.631
Whichever promotion
wins the most matches,

02:33.675 --> 02:35.024
gets control
of Hawaii wrestling--

02:35.067 --> 02:35.938
[stopwatch beeps]
- Time's up.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.289
- Ambitious.
- Very.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.031
- Okay, now, Lah,
your 30 seconds.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.946
- Is the timer sort of,
I don't know, rigid?

02:43.989 --> 02:45.600
- Hey, the system is working.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.689
You and Lah have
equal time to talk,

02:47.732 --> 02:51.171
and I don't have to deal with
you two beefing behind my back.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.911
Bruno?
- Lars, 30 seconds.

02:52.954 --> 02:53.999
[stopwatch beeps]
Go!

02:54.043 --> 02:55.436
- [slurps]

03:05.881 --> 03:08.100
I smoothed things over with
Jim Crockett and the guys--

03:08.144 --> 03:09.406
brought 'em back in the fold.

03:09.450 --> 03:13.105
Extra good news:
he's sending over NWA star

03:13.149 --> 03:14.324
Kerry Von Erich.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.891
- Good job, Lah.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.240
I love any Von Erich.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
- They're absolutely
beautiful men.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.504
Um, about Ata's idea--

03:20.548 --> 03:22.114
I mean, seven v. seven
sounds like math.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.681
Wrestling only needs two guys

03:23.725 --> 03:25.814
in trunks,
going chest-to-chest--

03:25.857 --> 03:26.989
[stopwatch beeps]
- Time's up, time's up.

03:30.862 --> 03:34.257
- I say we go with...

03:34.301 --> 03:35.258
Ata's gimmick.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.477
- Yes!

03:36.520 --> 03:38.566
Now, if you wanna
guarantee a sellout,

03:38.609 --> 03:41.003
we can ask Cyndi Lauper
to sing the national anthem.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.961
We talked at Vince's party
in New York.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.224
I think she'd be into it.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.965
- Bold, big, like Peter.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.620
The High Chief approves.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.233
- While my parents and Lars

03:53.276 --> 03:55.887
navigated a tenuous alliance,

03:55.930 --> 03:58.107
I had gone
through a little growth spurt.

03:58.150 --> 04:01.458
Mmm, this papaya
is crazy ripe.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.894
- Did you cut that yourself?

04:02.938 --> 04:04.287
You're not supposed
to play with knives.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.810
- What are you
touching knives for?

04:05.854 --> 04:07.377
- I thought you wanted me
to eat more fruit.

04:07.421 --> 04:10.250
- Canned fruits,
bananas, oranges.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.990
- Pears.
- Plums!

04:13.688 --> 04:15.429
- So how's planning going?

04:15.472 --> 04:16.733
What's do I get to do
for Grandpa's tribute?

04:16.778 --> 04:18.997
- You will be in the ring
with the family

04:19.041 --> 04:20.476
for Peter's ten-bell salute.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.871
- A time-honored method
of honoring those

04:22.914 --> 04:25.177
in the wrestling world
who have passed on.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.092
- Cool, but what else you got?

04:27.136 --> 04:28.224
- What, like a job, job?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.921
- Come on.
I've worked for Grandma.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.097
I'm capable of a lot more
than standing in the ring

04:32.141 --> 04:33.273
and looking handsome as hell.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.448
- Dewey.
[chuckles]

04:34.491 --> 04:36.188
- I'm ready
for real responsibilities.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.581
I'm not a kid anymore.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.366
In fact,
I'm no longer going by Dewey.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.889
That's a child's name.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.412
From now on,

04:42.456 --> 04:44.501
I'm Dwayne.
- Dwayne Johnson?

04:44.545 --> 04:46.373
[chuckles]
That just sounds weird.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.722
- You both came up with it.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.289
- Okay.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.420
Dwayne.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.817
[laughter]

04:55.860 --> 04:57.034
- I just wanted to know
my role,

04:57.079 --> 04:59.081
and they told me
to shut my mouth.

05:00.517 --> 05:00.952
.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.259
- While I was tired of being
treated like a little kid,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.216
my mom set out to pay off

05:04.260 --> 05:05.566
my grandmother's faith in her.

05:05.609 --> 05:06.784
[phone ringing]

05:06.828 --> 05:08.482
- You got Gretchen Calamari.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.397
- Hi, Gretchen.
This is Ata Johnson.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.441
I'm a wrestling promoter.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.921
Are you
Cyndi Lauper's publicist?

05:12.964 --> 05:14.270
- Mm, and Jan Hooks'.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.967
Catch her this summer
in "Wildcats."

05:16.011 --> 05:18.274
- Oh, okay.
Yeah, I will.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.189
Um, so we have
a big wrestling show coming up

05:20.232 --> 05:22.365
out here in Hawaii,
and I know it's a long shot,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.411
but I was just wondering
if Cyndi would maybe--

05:24.454 --> 05:25.673
- Why don't we ask her?

05:25.716 --> 05:27.370
I'll patch you through
to Cyndi right now.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.763
- Oh, really?
Just like that?

05:28.806 --> 05:30.721
- Oh, honestly,

05:30.765 --> 05:31.983
I'm on a little bit of thin ice

05:32.027 --> 05:34.246
with her at the mo'.
I took my gatekeeping

05:34.290 --> 05:35.987
too seriously, and I hung up

05:36.031 --> 05:38.903
on the president of a major
motion picture studio.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.558
Anyway, long story short,
Cyndi Lauper will not be

05:41.602 --> 05:43.952
attending "Police Academy"
with Steve Guttenberg.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.127
[phone rings]

05:46.346 --> 05:48.260
- Who'd you hang up
on this time, Gretch?

05:48.304 --> 05:49.784
- God, it was one time, Cyn.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.916
One time.
- Hi, Cyndi, it's me,

05:51.960 --> 05:54.441
Ata Johnson.
We met at the WWF party

05:54.484 --> 05:56.443
in New York.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

05:56.486 --> 05:57.879
How are ya?

05:57.922 --> 05:59.924
- I'm good, yeah.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.448
So we have
this big wrestling show

06:01.491 --> 06:03.188
coming up out here
to honor my dad,

06:03.232 --> 06:05.103
and you'd be perfect
to come out and sing

06:05.147 --> 06:06.975
the national anthem.
- Oh, wrestling?

06:07.018 --> 06:08.933
Hawaii?
America?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.195
I'm in!

06:10.239 --> 06:12.067
I know Hawaii's in America.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.982
But it's not like
the other parts, you know?

06:14.025 --> 06:17.072
It's detached--like my father,
emotionally.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.334
- Thank you.
[giggles]

06:18.378 --> 06:19.640
Look, I will personally see
to it

06:19.683 --> 06:21.468
that you're taken care of
when you come out--

06:21.511 --> 06:23.207
white glove.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.993
Gloves?
I--sorry, I can't remember

06:25.036 --> 06:26.821
which one.
- Fingerless gloves, hon.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.518
Give Gretchen all the details.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.520
I can't wait!

06:30.564 --> 06:32.522
- She never says bye.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.046
Nice sell job, by the way.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.353
You know, I could throw
Jan Hooks into this deal.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.790
She could use a little sun.
Hmm?

06:39.834 --> 06:40.965
- Uh-huh.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.968
- All right,
just think about it.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.144
Okay, there are
a few important things

06:46.188 --> 06:48.451
that Cyndi needs
for every show:

06:48.495 --> 06:50.497
first off, limo service.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.715
- With Cyndi locked in,

06:51.759 --> 06:53.674
my mom and Lars set out
to build hype

06:53.717 --> 06:55.023
with TV promos.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.981
Lars stayed on brand...

06:57.025 --> 06:59.027
- 'Cause I am
the tower of power,

06:59.070 --> 07:01.464
too sweet to be sour.
Yeah!

07:01.508 --> 07:04.467
- Well, be careful,
because I've got more soul

07:04.511 --> 07:05.686
than I can control!

07:05.729 --> 07:07.339
- Too many words.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.950
Bump chests.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.821
- â™ª I want it

07:10.865 --> 07:11.909
[both grunting]

07:11.953 --> 07:13.084
- Harder.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.525
- While my mom got
a little more creative.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.092
- Time to take out
the WPW trash.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.964
[both grunting]

07:23.007 --> 07:24.269
- Woo!

07:24.313 --> 07:25.880
- So many legends
came to Hawaii

07:25.923 --> 07:27.534
to pay tribute to my grandpa.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.839
- More chest.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.537
- I'm giving it
as much chest as I got, man.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.887
- Sheiky, baby, you are
making me chafe here!

07:32.930 --> 07:34.454
- How am I doing?

07:34.497 --> 07:36.543
- No notes, Sting.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.240
- Then there was
the main event.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.503
- Bold claims
from Lars Anderson!

07:40.547 --> 07:41.939
- Hey, let me
tell you something.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.594
It'll be so easy to take
the belt from this potato...

07:44.638 --> 07:47.554
- Wait, why aren't you the one
winning Grandpa's belt back?

07:47.597 --> 07:49.773
- Bad News trained
under Peter for a long time--

07:49.817 --> 07:51.253
one of his protÃ©gÃ©s.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.168
But you're a protÃ©gÃ©
and his son-in-law.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.691
Shouldn't it be you?

07:54.735 --> 07:57.738
- Look, Lars would never drop
the belt to me.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.043
We hate each other.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.871
So in the spirit
of everyone working together

08:00.915 --> 08:02.743
to honor your grandpa,

08:02.786 --> 08:05.572
this old man had to set
his ego aside for this one.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.138
- Do people
that put their egos aside

08:07.182 --> 08:09.314
usually talk in third person?

08:09.358 --> 08:11.403
- I ain't taking crap from
a kid in white leather pants.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.188
- These came
from the men's section.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.972
- Yeah?
You look like a divorcÃ©

08:15.016 --> 08:16.452
who flew in from Carmel.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.802
Did you lift those
off a Colombian drug lord?

08:18.846 --> 08:20.674
- Beautiful pants, no respect.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.718
- [laughs]

08:21.762 --> 08:22.937
- Peter is so handsome.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.069
- Mm, handsome legs.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.984
- Well, I think
I got the same legs.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.509
[laughter]

08:29.552 --> 08:31.423
- What's that mean?
- Drink, brother.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.991
[laughter]
- I like this guy.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.213
- Staring at the man
or the bread?

08:39.256 --> 08:40.998
- I can't believe
that's Kerry Von Erich.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.826
I have his poster in my room.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.480
- [laughs]
- Should I show him?

08:45.915 --> 08:47.309
No, that's kid stuff.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.354
- Show him.
He's a nice guy.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.227
- All right, just got word
that Ms. Lauper

08:52.270 --> 08:53.881
checked into her suite
in Waikiki.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360
- And you set up all the things
Cyndi's publicist asked for?

08:55.404 --> 08:56.710
- Got all the mangoes
and everything.

08:56.753 --> 08:57.928
- Perfect.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.321
- Okay, everyone.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.367
Thank you all for being here.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.282
Peter had a very special place

09:04.326 --> 09:06.197
in his heart
for each and every one of you--

09:06.241 --> 09:07.590
even you, Sheik.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.896
[laughter]

09:08.939 --> 09:10.114
- To the High Chief.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.290
- Yes.
- Yeah!

09:12.334 --> 09:14.641
- All right,
who's got a Peter story, huh?

09:14.684 --> 09:16.338
- How 'bout that time
he beat up that dude

09:16.381 --> 09:18.601
who made fun of him
for eating with his bare hands?

09:18.645 --> 09:20.037
[laughter]

09:20.081 --> 09:21.865
- Or maybe
a more appropriate story

09:21.909 --> 09:22.953
for our son to hear.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.260
- I can hear the stories.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.696
What are you talking about?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.176
- Disrespect our culture,

09:28.219 --> 09:30.526
and Peter would defend
the honor of all Samoans.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.528
- With his bare hands
yet again.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.399
[vocalizes crushing]
- Sika!

09:34.443 --> 09:37.054
- What about that story
from the bar in Japan,

09:37.098 --> 09:39.013
where he bite man
through his cheek?

09:39.056 --> 09:40.884
Uh, Billy some--
- [clears throat]

09:40.928 --> 09:43.365
- My frustrations
had reached their peak.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.280
I'm not a little kid!

09:45.323 --> 09:48.588
I can handle the adult stuff.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.244
- I agree.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.681
- You do?
- Yes.

09:54.724 --> 09:55.812
It is time.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.509
Would you do the honor

09:57.553 --> 09:59.424
of bringing Peter's belt
to the ring

09:59.468 --> 10:01.122
to start the ceremony?

10:01.165 --> 10:02.732
[all cheering]

10:02.776 --> 10:03.690
- Let's go.
Whoo!

10:07.737 --> 10:08.695
- That's my boy.

10:10.914 --> 10:11.132
.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.829
- Showtime.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.483
I was excited
about my bigger role:

10:14.526 --> 10:18.139
helping my parents celebrate
my grandfather's legacy.

10:18.182 --> 10:21.055

by Bob Catley]

10:21.098 --> 10:26.016
â™ª

10:26.060 --> 10:28.018
- â™ª Got my back
against the wall â™ª

10:28.062 --> 10:29.541
- Five minutes till showtime,
people.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.543
Pee now or hold it.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.849
- Gotta go.
Oh, yeah!

10:32.893 --> 10:34.677
- Sheik goes to big stall.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.896
- [clears throat]
Hey, Ata.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.681
We could flip
the Rocky/Macho match

10:38.725 --> 10:40.683
with Andre and Flair.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.380
Flair's much better
when he gets to sleep in.

10:42.424 --> 10:43.730
- It's 4:15 p.m.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
- It's Ric Flair.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.822
â™ª

10:48.865 --> 10:50.650
- Well, I think
we keep it as is.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.999
This makes more sense
for the flow

10:52.042 --> 10:54.871
of the WPW vs. PPPW
scoring system.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.438
Oh, national anthem time.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.005
Can you grab Ms. Lauper
from her dressing room, please?

10:58.048 --> 10:59.441
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, she ain't in there.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.442
- What?
Why?

11:00.485 --> 11:01.530
- Never showed up.

11:01.573 --> 11:02.749
For some reason,
Jan Hooks is here.

11:02.792 --> 11:06.230
- [laughs]
Now do Kitty Dukakis.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.536
[laughs]

11:07.579 --> 11:09.059
- You said she checked
into the hotel, right?

11:09.103 --> 11:10.800
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
Man, such a shame.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.497
You know, what a waste
of an elegant mango tray

11:12.541 --> 11:13.847
I set up for her.
- You make things

11:13.890 --> 11:17.720
too complicated,
this is what happens.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.504
- Everything okay?
- Uh, no,

11:19.548 --> 11:20.723
Cyndi Lauper is missing,
but don't worry.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.246
I'm gonna go figure it out.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.858
- Just be back for the tribute.
Peter hates tardiness.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.337
- Okay, all right.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.863
[phone rings]

11:29.906 --> 11:31.560
- Gretchen Calamari.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.910
- Hi, Gretchen.
It's Ata.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.825
Um, Cyndi is not here,
and the show is starting.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.610
- Oh, sorry.
Not my job anymore.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.178
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Did she fire you?

11:41.222 --> 11:43.964
- No, no, no, no, no.
I just turned 40,

11:44.007 --> 11:46.357
and I was like,
"What am I doing with my life?"

11:46.401 --> 11:48.751
You know?
So I am about to hop on a plane

11:48.795 --> 11:50.884
to Belize.
I will patch you through

11:50.927 --> 11:53.321
to Cyn-Cyn
for one last hoorah.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.453
[phone rings]
- Four Seasons.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.629
- Mona FlambÃ©'s room, please.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.153
[phone rings]

11:59.196 --> 12:01.546
- I already have
plenty of towels.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.200
- No, Cyndi, it's me, Ata.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.375
- I'm here too, Cyn.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.116
- Gretch, how's Belize?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.640
- Not there yet,
but I will send you a postcard

12:08.684 --> 12:09.990
as soon as I land.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.210
- Great, uh, Cyndi,
did our driver not show up?

12:13.254 --> 12:15.952
- He came, but his sign
had my name on it

12:15.996 --> 12:18.259
instead of my alias,
Mona FlambÃ©.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.784
Well, fans saw it, and now
I can't leave the hotel.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.873
- Mona FlambÃ©?

12:23.917 --> 12:25.396
Oh, I thought you said

12:25.440 --> 12:28.399
"mango flambÃ©
in your dressing room."

12:28.443 --> 12:29.618
Okay, well, stay right there.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.924
I'm gonna pick you up
in the alley

12:30.967 --> 12:32.926
outside your hotel.
- All right, sounds good.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.449
- All right,
you two ladies have fun, huh?

12:34.492 --> 12:35.798
- Love ya, Gretch.
- Okay, thanks, Gretchen.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.408
- Love you.
Buh-bye.

12:37.452 --> 12:40.194
- And now, to start the night,

12:40.237 --> 12:42.936
Peter's grandson will bring out

12:42.979 --> 12:45.852

just how special it was

to be a part of this family...

12:56.732 --> 13:02.172
â™ª

13:02.216 --> 13:04.348
To inherit the legacy
my grandfather started...

13:04.392 --> 13:08.352
â™ª

13:08.396 --> 13:10.659
And to carry
that legacy forward.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.880
[cheers and applause]

13:13.923 --> 13:15.490
It felt unbelievable.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.840
Like, almost, I could feel
High Chief watching me.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.450
- High Chief watches
all of our matches.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.713
- When the temperature
in the ring drops dramatically,

13:21.757 --> 13:23.019
it means he's bored.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.543
- Showing respect
to those who came before you

13:25.587 --> 13:27.937
is the most mature thing

13:27.981 --> 13:29.547
a man can do.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.636
Dewey!
[laughter]

13:31.680 --> 13:33.595
- Wh--
is that your son?

13:33.638 --> 13:35.727
Damn, you grew up.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.468
- See?
Cyndi Lauper gets it.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.253
- Yes, he's tall now.
We're all impressed.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.777
Okay, gotta go.
- Oh, bye.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.566
- Folks,
all the old rivalries,

13:48.610 --> 13:50.873
friends, foes, gambling debts

13:50.917 --> 13:53.920
are all out the window.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.748
- Macho Man's body
repels baby oil.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.664
It's spraying onto the fans.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.101
- I think it's genetic.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.716
Sting and Sheik ready in two.
- Okay, she's here.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.457
She's ready.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.893
- Hello, Cyndi.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.982
You look just as beautiful
when you are late.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.679
- Oh, thank you, angel.

14:14.723 --> 14:15.898
- Okay,
so once the ring clears,

14:15.942 --> 14:18.248
Cyndi's gonna go out and sing.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.684
- She's gonna sing
the national anthem

14:19.728 --> 14:20.903
in the middle of the show?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.122
- She's Cyndi Lauper.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.519
Wait,

14:28.563 --> 14:29.651
Rocky just wrestled?

14:29.694 --> 14:30.782
He's not supposed
to be on till later.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.349
- Lah changed it.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.831
The stopwatch ran 30 seconds,
but you didn't object.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.615
- Because I wasn't here!

14:37.659 --> 14:39.226
- It's the fairest system
we have.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.141
- And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

14:41.184 --> 14:43.795
to sing the national anthem,

14:43.839 --> 14:46.015
right now, for some reason:

14:46.059 --> 14:48.626
Miss Cyndi Lauper!

14:48.670 --> 14:50.540
[all cheering]

14:50.585 --> 14:52.500
[laughter]

14:54.676 --> 14:56.504
- All right, Honolulu,

14:56.547 --> 14:57.809
let's see if I can do this

14:57.853 --> 14:58.985
without cursing.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.682
[laughter]

15:00.725 --> 15:01.944
- We were all feeling good

15:01.988 --> 15:03.946
until an old rivalry
reared its head.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.209
[door slams]

15:06.253 --> 15:08.081
Dad, what's wrong?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.517
Lars changed the finish.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.954
He's beating Bad News
and keeping Peter's belt.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.303
- Wait, he can do that?

15:13.347 --> 15:15.001
- He's doing it.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.785
Damn it!
I knew this would happen.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.308
A leopard
doesn't change its spots,

15:18.352 --> 15:20.484
especially a lumpy-ass leopard
like Lars.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.660
- I don't know why--
maybe because we were honoring

15:22.704 --> 15:24.184
my grandfather that night--

15:24.227 --> 15:26.751
but I took the move from Lars
as a slap in the face...

15:26.795 --> 15:28.318
Lars!
And I snapped.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.885
How dare you
be so disrespectful

15:29.929 --> 15:30.973
on my grandfather's night!

15:31.017 --> 15:32.322
I'll beat your [bleep] ass!

15:32.366 --> 15:35.282
[all shouting]

15:38.111 --> 15:38.502
.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.765
- Sting's brother-in-law
is from Iran!

15:40.809 --> 15:42.550
I wonder how that's gonna play
into this match.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.639
- While I was going
toe-to-toe with Lars,

15:44.682 --> 15:46.467
my mom was getting things
back on track.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.600
- Ugh, Lars got chip dust
on my clipboard.

15:49.644 --> 15:50.732
- Come to the locker room.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.603
You won't believe
what Dewey just did.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.304
- After the fight,
there was only one person

15:57.347 --> 15:58.783
who came up to talk to me.

16:04.615 --> 16:05.790
- Sticking up
for your grandfather...

16:07.227 --> 16:09.403
Good for you, man.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.187
- Really nice guy,

16:11.231 --> 16:13.320
and one of my heroes.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.930
- There he is.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.846
- Are you okay, Dewey?
Lars, is this true?

16:17.889 --> 16:18.934
- That your kid
tried to get his ass laid out

16:18.978 --> 16:20.109
in front
of the whole locker room?

16:20.153 --> 16:21.589
- You changed the finish
to the main event

16:21.632 --> 16:23.504
without talking to me.
- I made a business decision

16:23.547 --> 16:24.679
when you were off playing

16:24.722 --> 16:25.941
"Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous"

16:25.985 --> 16:27.856
with Cyndi Lauper.
- More like Lars

16:27.899 --> 16:29.379
looking out for Lars.
- It's the wrong ending

16:29.423 --> 16:30.554
for a tribute show.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.600
They wanna see
a feel-good story.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.602
They want the good guy
to beat the bad guy,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.038
simple as that.
- Oh, we can do that

16:36.082 --> 16:37.213
right here, right now.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.171
- I'm fine with all that.
- Oh, are you?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.260
- Stop!

16:40.303 --> 16:41.435
This fighting is unbecoming

16:41.478 --> 16:43.524
of a night dedicated
to High Chief.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.395
Get your panties
out of bunches.

16:45.439 --> 16:49.051
It is time
for Peter's ceremony.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.183
Now!

16:50.226 --> 16:53.360
- And now a tribute to the life

16:53.403 --> 16:56.189
and legacy of Peter Maivia.

16:56.232 --> 16:59.018
- What started as a great
night for me ended up here:

16:59.061 --> 17:01.498
all of us sad,

17:01.542 --> 17:03.196
mad,

17:03.239 --> 17:04.848
and ashamed

17:04.893 --> 17:07.156
in front of everybody.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.073
Yup, that really happened,

17:11.117 --> 17:12.683
and those were my pants.

17:12.727 --> 17:17.079
- Please rise
for a ten-bell salute to honor

17:17.123 --> 17:18.385
the High Chief.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.605
[bell dinging]

17:24.304 --> 17:25.740
- Seeing how much
my grandfather meant

17:25.782 --> 17:27.220
to all of these guys...

17:27.262 --> 17:28.395
[bell dinging]

17:28.438 --> 17:30.919
To my family...

17:30.962 --> 17:33.443
I couldn't have felt worse
that I had ruined his night.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.054
[bell dings]

17:35.097 --> 17:37.491
- And here we are, folks,
the main event.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.754
One of these gladiators
will bring home

17:39.797 --> 17:42.757
Peter Maivia's
championship belt.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.976
- I'm sorry
I tried to fight Lars.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.023
- It wasn't
the right thing to do,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.677
but believe me,

17:49.720 --> 17:51.853
I understand why you did it.

17:51.896 --> 17:55.770
- Him disrespecting Grandpa
like that just made me so mad.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.946
I wasn't even thinking.
I just--

17:57.989 --> 17:59.513
I don't know.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.776
- Son, you don't think I wanna
fight people all the time?

18:01.819 --> 18:03.169
With these jackhammers
for arms,

18:03.212 --> 18:04.692
I can knock out
every Tom, Dick, and Harry

18:04.735 --> 18:06.520
that pisses me off,
but I don't.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.130
You know why?
- Lawsuits?

18:08.174 --> 18:09.479
- Yes, lawsuits,

18:09.523 --> 18:11.699
but also, part
of being an adult

18:11.742 --> 18:15.050
is setting ego aside,
keeping your cool.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.095
- Right.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.706
- Another part
of being an adult:

18:18.749 --> 18:20.316
don't fight guys
a hundred pounds

18:20.360 --> 18:21.796
above your weight class.

18:21.839 --> 18:22.971
- [scoffs]
I would've had him.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.320
- [scoffs]
No, absolutely not.

18:24.364 --> 18:25.930
I would've been checking you
out of the hospital.

18:25.974 --> 18:29.064
- What?
- [laughs]

18:29.108 --> 18:30.892
- A vicious clothesline!

18:30.935 --> 18:33.373
He's going in for the pin.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.896
One, two,

18:34.939 --> 18:37.290
three.
[bell rings]

18:37.333 --> 18:42.295
And still Polynesian Pacific
Pro Wrestling Champion,

18:42.338 --> 18:46.255
Lars Anderson!

18:46.299 --> 18:49.171
[crowd shouting "Lars"]

18:51.869 --> 18:52.914
- All I wanted to do
was protect

18:52.957 --> 18:54.655
my grandfather's legacy,

18:54.698 --> 18:56.309
but there was nothing
I could do.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.701
- Lars! Lars!

18:57.745 --> 18:59.138
- How is
everyone's night going?

18:59.181 --> 19:00.226
- You got
what you wanted, Lars.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.618
Don't rub it in.

19:01.662 --> 19:02.619
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.447
- Enough.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.885
All this time, you still
don't understand our business.

19:07.929 --> 19:11.193
It doesn't matter
who Peter's belt is on.

19:11.237 --> 19:14.631
We put it on who we want,
when we want.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.678
- She's right.
It's just business.

19:17.721 --> 19:21.377
- And we take it off
who we want,

19:21.421 --> 19:22.378
when we want.

19:22.422 --> 19:25.816
[dramatic music]

19:25.860 --> 19:27.209
You're right, Lah.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.689
It is just business,

19:28.732 --> 19:30.256
but it's family business.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.693
Next time you want
to change the finish,

19:32.736 --> 19:33.998
you talk to us.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.522
- What do you mean?
I'm the booker.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.697
I make the decisions.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.351
- Not anymore.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.179
Ata decides now.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.268
[rock music]

19:42.311 --> 19:45.184
Now, if you'll excuse us,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.708
I'm going to celebrate
this great night

19:47.751 --> 19:49.492
the way Peter would've wanted:

19:49.536 --> 19:51.668
with family

19:51.712 --> 19:54.236
at Ruth's Chris Steak House.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.674
â™ª

19:57.718 --> 19:59.894
If Peter was in your shoes,

19:59.937 --> 20:01.765
he would've done
the same thing.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.029
Wouldn't you, High Chief?

20:05.073 --> 20:07.380
- Turns out protecting
Peter's legacy

20:07.423 --> 20:08.946
united the whole family.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.948
But though the show was
a success,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.341
my family's
wrestling promotion

20:12.385 --> 20:13.734
never got back on its feet,

20:13.777 --> 20:15.257
and instead of capitalizing

20:15.301 --> 20:18.086
on the wrestling boom
of the mid-'80s,

20:18.129 --> 20:20.088
we took a financial hit
we never recovered from,

20:20.131 --> 20:22.873
which brings me right back
to you and your family

20:22.917 --> 20:25.920
and your country's
coffee legacy.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.748
Prime Minister,
you and your country

20:27.791 --> 20:29.358
now have all the leverage,

20:29.402 --> 20:31.926
and if there's anything that
you've taken from my story,

20:31.969 --> 20:34.189
it's that if you don't strike
while the iron's hot,

20:34.233 --> 20:38.237
then the moment
can pass you by.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.371
What if we imported
the Gjelgjiughm coffee method

20:42.415 --> 20:44.504
to the United States?
- Yes, but Dwayne,

20:44.547 --> 20:46.419
the method is very complex.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.465
- That's why you'll send us
a select group of emissaries

20:49.509 --> 20:51.119
who will oversee the growing.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.425
In exchange
for the stewardship,

20:52.468 --> 20:54.862
Gjelgjiughm will receive
a percentage of profit

20:54.905 --> 20:56.603
for every coffee crop.

20:56.646 --> 21:00.433
[dramatic music]

21:00.476 --> 21:05.307
- Let me think on it, and we
can reconvene in the morning?

21:05.351 --> 21:08.658
- Hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for my robe.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.007
- Oh...
- It is the best robe

21:10.051 --> 21:11.574
I have ever put on my body.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.749
- [laughs]
- Go ahead.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.011
Touch my sleeve.
- I don't need to touch

21:14.055 --> 21:16.318
your robe, because
I also have a robe, Bibi!

21:16.362 --> 21:19.365
- Oh, there's my diva!

21:19.408 --> 21:20.714
I have missed this energy.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.891
[cackling]

21:27.460 --> 21:29.679
- Just--it'll keep going.
