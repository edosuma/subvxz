WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:05.395
Good morning, Jack.

00:05.538 --> 00:07.699
Lemon, I'm helping to organize
a little fund-raising dinner

00:07.841 --> 00:09.069
for John McCain
this weekend,

00:09.209 --> 00:10.699
and I need
some women to attend

00:10.844 --> 00:13.142
so it doesn't turn into
another giant sausagefest.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.439
Well, I don't kno...

00:14.581 --> 00:17.141
What's the Committee
to Re-Invade Vietnam?

00:17.283 --> 00:18.375
Just say you'll come.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.485
Jonathan's going
to round up

00:19.619 --> 00:21.086
all the cool
Republican celebrities.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.416
Like who? Chuck Norris?

00:23.556 --> 00:24.750
No, C-Nor and I
had a falling-out

00:24.891 --> 00:26.552
after I switched
to another dojo.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.888
Ah, well, sorry,
but I'm not giving anybody money

00:29.029 --> 00:30.758
until there's
campaign finance reform.

00:30.897 --> 00:32.990
Also, I'm saving up money
for a new humidifier.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.158
It's the same model
that's keeping Larry King alive.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.326
Oh, and I want you to book
the Subway Hero onto the show.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.064
Who?
The Subway Hero.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.366
Do you not watch the news?

00:41.508 --> 00:43.567
Food Network doesn't have
a news show.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.473
This guy
stepped in front of a train

00:45.612 --> 00:47.910
to save a total stranger
who had fallen on the tracks.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.140
He pulled him
between the rails,

00:49.282 --> 00:50.681
and the train missed
their heads by inches.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.341
Wow! That's amazing. I know.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.885
Every show wants a guest
appearance by the Subway Hero.

00:55.021 --> 00:57.251
But...
we have an advantage.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.118
We do?

00:59.159 --> 01:00.888
<i>For his exceptional courage,</i>

01:01.027 --> 01:04.986
<i>the city of New York bestows
the Bronze Medallion</i>

01:05.131 --> 01:06.928
<i>on Dennis Duffy.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:08.261
Oh, no.

01:09.436 --> 01:10.425
<i>Thank you,
Mayor Bloomberger.</i>

01:10.570 --> 01:13.403
<i>I accept this honor
on behalf of every...</i>

01:13.540 --> 01:15.531
<i>Stern rules!
Baba Booey!</i>

01:15.675 --> 01:17.370
No, no.
No, no, no.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.477
Oh, yes.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.705
Dennis Duffy... beeper salesman
and your ex-boyfriend.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.543
And "Dateline" predator.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.082
Exonerated
"Dateline" predator.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.118
The whole thing was one big,
silly misunderstanding,

01:27.253 --> 01:28.777
like the Giuliani campaign.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.412
No way!
Forget about it!

01:30.557 --> 01:31.524
Lemon, be professional.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.626
We all have to work with people
we hate sometimes.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.218
<i>Jonathan, why don't you
put on more of that cologne?</i>

01:37.363 --> 01:39.354
<i>When I say "subway,"
you say "hero"!</i>

01:39.499 --> 01:40.397
<i>Subway!</i>

01:40.533 --> 01:41.761
<i>Hero?</i>

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.988 --> 02:04.889
I now declare this store open
for all mankind.

02:05.024 --> 02:05.991
Dennis!

02:08.761 --> 02:10.023
Hey, dummy.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.290
Dennis.
I knew you'd be back.

02:12.432 --> 02:13.763
Yeah, I'm not back.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.095
Jack sent me
because he wants you on "TGS."

02:16.236 --> 02:17.430
No way.
This is fate.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.970
You swore to me that you
would never see me again.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.836
But this whole crazy, on-again,
off-again Dennis-Liz thing...

02:22.976 --> 02:23.943
It just
can't be stopped.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.069
No, we don't have
a crazy thing.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.647
Yeah, we do. We're like Ross
and Rachel but just not gay.

02:29.782 --> 02:32.080
Can I borrow
those giant scissors?

02:32.218 --> 02:33.378
We always knew this would
happen, didn't we?

02:33.520 --> 02:34.680
I mean,
that I would be somebody.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.948
I just can't believe
it's happening because of this

02:37.090 --> 02:38.318
and not because
of my band.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.222
I- I-I just wanna rock?

02:41.361 --> 02:43.124
<i>Yeah, well, you have had
some fame before.</i>

02:43.263 --> 02:44.287
You were on "Dateline. "

02:44.430 --> 02:46.625
Whoa, hey!
I knew you were gonna say that.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.496
That is so unfair!
I knew that girl was 18.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.763
She told me that
her last boyfriend was Asian,

02:51.905 --> 02:53.964
and that crap doesn't start
until college.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.234
Do you want
to do the show or not?

02:56.376 --> 02:59.277
I don't know.
You know?

02:59.412 --> 03:01.846
Getting lots of offers
from news and dancing programs.

03:02.982 --> 03:04.847
But how can I say no to you,
right?

03:04.984 --> 03:08.078
I mean, maybe we should just see
where this crazy

03:08.221 --> 03:11.384
Dennis-Liz roller-coaster ride
takes us, huh?

03:19.732 --> 03:21.666
Jonathan?

03:21.801 --> 03:22.790
Who is this?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.234
Oh!
It's Bucky Bright, sir.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.101
He was a major TV star
in the '40s, '50s,

03:28.241 --> 03:29.503
and the fall of 1972,

03:29.642 --> 03:31.735
and he's your
Republican celebrity

03:31.878 --> 03:32.845
for the McCain dinner.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.037
Uh-huh.
Good to see you.

03:34.180 --> 03:35.477
What happened
to Bruce Willis?

03:35.615 --> 03:36.582
He insists on singing.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.149
<i>Jim Belushi?
He insists on singing.</i>

03:38.284 --> 03:40.343
Good God, when did the party
become so boring?

03:40.486 --> 03:42.147
The Democrats have
all the good celebrities.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.483
Mr. Donaghy,
this was delivered to...

03:44.624 --> 03:47.024
Son of a married couple!
Bucky Bright!

03:47.160 --> 03:48.627
You know who this is?

03:48.761 --> 03:49.728
Who doesn't?

03:49.862 --> 03:52.057
Most people. But let me
ask you a question, Kenneth.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.996
If Mr. Bright here told you to
vote Republican, would you do it?

03:55.134 --> 03:56.158
Oh, uh, no, sir.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.099
I don't vote Republican
or Democrat.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.139
Choosing is a sin, so I always
just write in the Lord's name.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.299
That's Republican.
We count those.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.104
Well, I don't know whether
you know it or not,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.712
but I used to do
the old soft-shoe

04:06.846 --> 04:08.541
at all
the Eisenhower rallies.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.879
1, 2...

04:11.017 --> 04:12.917
I'm sorry to have wasted
your time, Mr. Bright.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.314
Kenneth here will show you out. Oh.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.751
Thank you.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.562
Boy, 30 Rock.
Mm.

04:23.696 --> 04:26.187
Stories I could tell
about this place.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.562
Eh, nobody wants to listen
to me anymore.

04:28.701 --> 04:33.104
Oh, Mr. Bright, I would love
to hear about the good old days.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.706
Well, it was different
back then, I'll tell you.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.604
Yes, sir, boy,
they were classy.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.438
Yeah.
Yeah, it was.

04:38.578 --> 04:41.570
We didn't have any of those
shirts with words on them

04:41.714 --> 04:43.545
or dungarees
or anything like that.

04:43.683 --> 04:44.843
No, sirree.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.509
Men came to work...
ties and hats.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.087
That's so elegant.
Yeah.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.486
And you had tailor-made suits
and a little place here

04:51.624 --> 04:54.115
for a little carnation
in your lapel.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.228
And an inside
monogrammed pocket, you know,

04:56.362 --> 04:58.796
for your opium pipe
and your switchblade.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.593
I'm sorry... what, now?

05:01.734 --> 05:03.793
Say, why don't you show me
around the old studio?

05:03.936 --> 05:05.403
Okay.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.835
These things
are so bad for me.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.467
400% of my sodium?
I should not be eating these.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.204
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

05:14.347 --> 05:15.780
the bravest New Yorker
since Bernie Goetz,

05:15.915 --> 05:17.246
Mr. Dennis Duffy.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.408
Yeah!

05:21.688 --> 05:22.620
What's with the trophy?

05:22.755 --> 05:25.087
It's the Stanley Cup, honey.
It's hockey's ultimate prize.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.818
And me and it... We're teaming
up to fight illiteracy.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.327
Wow. I never would have had the
guts to do what that dude did.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.829
You don't know that.
I do know.

05:32.965 --> 05:35.058
I've watched seven different
people die in subway stations.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.998
So, Dennis, tell us what
it was like in the moment.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.103
What was going
through your mind?

05:38.237 --> 05:39.727
You know,
it was all instinct, Jack?

05:39.872 --> 05:40.839
My mind, it was so clear.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.600
All I could think about
was Derek Jeter.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.232
And it was like,
"Check this out, Jeter.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.605
You think
you're better than me?

05:45.745 --> 05:46.734
Huh?"

05:46.879 --> 05:47.777
Ahh! Ahh!?

05:47.914 --> 05:49.313
Oh, yeah!

05:49.449 --> 05:50.711
Yeah!

05:53.319 --> 05:55.810
Wow.
So you brought Dennis back.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.252
Only 'cause Jack made me.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.359
It's just that you said,
"Never again," but here he is.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.552
You said, "I don't know
what I see in that guy. "

06:02.695 --> 06:04.185
But I was there
when you two met.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.855
You do have
this weird connection.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.229
Ugh, why is this movie
called "The Hours"

06:09.369 --> 06:11.269
when it feels
so much longer?

06:11.404 --> 06:13.031
They should call
this thing "The Weeks. "

06:13.172 --> 06:15.037
Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.402
Hi.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.278
"The Weeks. "

06:20.413 --> 06:21.880
Liz, listen to me.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.505
Dennis is like those
off-brand Mexican cheetos.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.117
My Sabor De Soledad?

06:26.252 --> 06:28.516
I only have Spanish delis
in my neighborhood.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.019
You know
those are bad for you,

06:30.156 --> 06:31.680
but you keep stuffing them
in your mouth

06:31.824 --> 06:33.018
because it's easier
to do that

06:33.159 --> 06:34.490
than to bother
to eat well.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.185
That's a weak metaphor.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.492
You deserve a good meal,
Liz.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.429
Subway Hero!

06:42.735 --> 06:43.963
Subway Hero!

06:45.671 --> 06:46.729
Subway Hero!

06:46.873 --> 06:48.864
Tracy!
My friend.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.475
Have you ever considered

06:50.610 --> 06:52.737
becoming the celebrity face
of the Republican Party?

06:52.879 --> 06:55.313
What?!
Hell, no!

06:55.448 --> 06:57.643
Black people
supporting Republicans?

06:57.784 --> 07:01.413
Does hot support cold?
Does rain support the Earth?

07:01.554 --> 07:02.885
Now, that misperception

07:03.022 --> 07:06.014
is precisely why the GOP needs
better celebrities.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.059
And a black celebrity,
such as yourself,

07:08.194 --> 07:09.684
would really make us
look good.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.660
Now, do you like
lower taxes?

07:11.798 --> 07:13.231
If I paid taxes,
I sure would.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.993
How about gun ownership?
Go on.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.068
States' rights?
I love states' rights!

07:17.203 --> 07:20.661
And let none of us forget that
the GOP is the party of Lincoln.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.104
Lincoln was
a Republican?

07:22.241 --> 07:24.300
Actually,
today's Republican Party

07:24.444 --> 07:25.706
would be unrecognizable
to Lincoln.

07:25.845 --> 07:26.937
He fought a war

07:27.079 --> 07:28.944
to preserve federal authority
over the states.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.514
That's not exactly
small government.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.675
Dot Com,
this need you have

07:32.819 --> 07:34.946
to be the smartest guy
in the room is...

07:35.087 --> 07:36.782
Off-putting.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.790
I guess that's why
I'm still single.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.124
Damn.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.320
The Republican Party sounds
pretty attuned

07:44.464 --> 07:45.795
to my unique way of life.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.867
But I'd be turning my back
on my people to support it.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.869
You put me in a quandary,
Jack Donaghy.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.404
A quandary.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.541
Back then we didn't have pages,
you know.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.408
We had what we called
"sandwich girls. "

08:01.547 --> 08:03.174
Oh, because they got
you sandwiches?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.375
No, no, no.
Two guys would get...

08:05.518 --> 08:07.213
Hey, my old dressing room.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.116
You know,
that reminds me...

08:09.255 --> 08:10.415
"For 5 bucks, I will. "

08:14.427 --> 08:16.725
Hey, dummy,
I was just telling these dummies

08:16.863 --> 08:19.423
how we used to go to the park
and make fun of all the joggers.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.056
Oh, yeah. "I'm gonna run in a
circle so I can live longer!"

08:22.201 --> 08:23.293
Hold on a second.

08:23.436 --> 08:24.960
Who orders a salad
from a burger joint?

08:25.104 --> 08:27.197
You watching your figure,
there, sweetheart?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.069
What, are you gearing up
for swimsuit season?

08:29.208 --> 08:30.232
Very funny.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.707
"Very funny"?
How would you know?

08:34.746 --> 08:36.908
We used to call this
the Jew Room.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.744
Here. Here's some lettuce
from my burger.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.611
Hey, chief,
the kid's birthday party

08:42.755 --> 08:44.222
that hired
the Urkel impersonator

08:44.357 --> 08:45.324
is down around the hall.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.692
Are you gonna cry?
Yeah, she's gonna cry.

08:50.229 --> 08:53.596
Hey. Hey, Frank...
Give her some lettuce.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.273
Elizabeth Conworthy Lemon.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.773
Okay, that's not
my middle name.

09:03.910 --> 09:04.899
Explain this.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.480
"Subway Hero Dennis Duffy
and actress Sally Field"?

09:08.614 --> 09:11.447
Entertaining a guest of the show
is called being professional.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.417
It wasn't a date or whatever.
I paid for dinner.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.021
You always paid
for Dennis.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.715
He can't get credit cards,
Jenna,

09:18.858 --> 09:21.418
because his cousin Teddy
used Dennis' Social

09:21.561 --> 09:23.688
to get a cellphone
that Teddy then couldn't pay for

09:23.829 --> 09:26.024
because this Indian guy
that he was working for...

09:26.165 --> 09:27.063
You know what?

09:27.199 --> 09:29.064
I don't have to explain myself
to you.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.136
Oh. Sir.
Hmm?

09:32.271 --> 09:33.203
You're back.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.203
Well, I never left.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.466
Uh, actually,

09:35.608 --> 09:38.008
I just wandered
around the building all night.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.635
I didn't run into another
single living soul.

09:40.780 --> 09:44.841
Except one
gigantic lesbian.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.187
Who is Conan O'Brien, and...
why is she so sad?

09:50.456 --> 09:53.550
We didn't light it,
but we tried to fight it?

09:53.693 --> 09:57.129
Birth control, Ho Chi Minh,
Richard Nixon... Nixon...?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.163
Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...
Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...?

09:59.298 --> 10:01.232
Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...
Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...?

10:01.367 --> 10:03.096
Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...
Nixon... Nixon...?

10:11.043 --> 10:13.841
What is this place?

10:13.980 --> 10:16.710
It's... purgatory, Tracy.

10:16.849 --> 10:17.713
Richard Nixon?

10:17.850 --> 10:18.976
Oh.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.983
I can't believe
I'm dead.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.850
There was still so much left
on my bucket list.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.788
So many different kind of
buckets I wanted to own.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.120
Buckets.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.693
It's never too late,
Tracy.

10:29.829 --> 10:32.457
You can't die now.
Your party needs you.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.567
We've lost some prestige because
of the Bush administration.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.396
And Watergate.
Uh-bup-bup-bup-bup.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.937
I'm trying to keep that
on the DL around here.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.303
Look, I know you're
worried about this.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.808
But there's a long history
of black entertainers

10:45.945 --> 10:47.173
supporting the GOP.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.282
Just ask my old friend
Sammy Davis Jr.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.974
Oh, Sam. Sammy!

10:53.319 --> 10:55.150
Tracy. Babe.

10:55.287 --> 10:58.620
You got to help the party
get back to its groovy roots.

10:58.758 --> 11:01.454
Wow.
You were a Republican?

11:01.594 --> 11:06.224
He sure was. Black. Jewish.
One eye. A white wife.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.595
It was a big tent back then,
Tracy.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.361
Help us...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.596
to make it a big tent
once again.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.730
...Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...
Nixon... Nixon... Nixon...?

11:15.875 --> 11:18.639
I got a mission!

11:18.778 --> 11:20.370
Dennis.
Hey, Jack.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.537
What are your politics?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.308
Social conservative,
fiscal liberal.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.612
You see, the GOP is trying
to raise its celebrity profile,

11:26.752 --> 11:29.653
and we would love it if the
Subway Hero could help us out.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.086
Aw, no can do, pally.

11:31.223 --> 11:33.623
I can't help McCain.
He's a Navy man.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.192
I almost joined
the Marines once.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.157
All right, fine.
I admit it.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.492
Dinner with Dennis last night
was fun.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.225
Oh, God. Liz!

11:42.368 --> 11:44.359
What? I don't like
a lot of people, Jenna,

11:44.503 --> 11:46.334
but that dumb creep
makes me laugh.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.496
But you know better.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.904
Do I?
I might be an idiot.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.068
I know I'm supposed to make myself
nice meals instead of eating junk.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.907
Do you know what
I use my oven for?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.412
Warming your jeans
in the morning?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.346
That's right.
And it feels good.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.951
Know what that subway thing
taught me, Jack?

12:00.086 --> 12:02.179
It taught me to follow my instincts
more. That's how you get ahead.

12:02.321 --> 12:05.017
You must know what I'm talking
about... You smell rich. Thank you.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.317
My cologne is distilled

12:06.459 --> 12:07.983
from the bilge water
of Rupert Murdoch's yacht.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.425
My point is, Jack, you got to be
a man of action in this world.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.962
You know,
you can't overthink stuff.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.464
I agree. Not thinking
is what makes America great.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.662
That wardrobe is wack.

12:16.802 --> 12:17.791
I want a leather jacket

12:17.937 --> 12:19.461
with a glow-in-the-dark
skeleton T-shirt

12:19.605 --> 12:20.731
and a porkpie hat
for my head.

12:20.873 --> 12:21.999
All right?
Pronto.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.608
This photo shoot's
got to be phenomenal.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.268
You seem like a man who knows
exactly what he wants.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.470
Yeah, I do.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.308
You don't know what I'm
going through. Lemon?

12:29.448 --> 12:31.609
Good luck with that, Dennis.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.844
No luck needed, Jack.
She bought me dinner last night.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.453
Really?
Yeah.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.577
I'm in.

12:36.722 --> 12:38.781
And when I grab on,
I do not let go.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.223
Like a killer whale going nuts
on his trainer at SeaWorld.

12:42.361 --> 12:43.885
Everything in my life
is work.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.121
But not Dennis Duffy.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.357
I don't have to shave.
I don't have to bathe.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.127
I don't have to be clever
or nice.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.066
You know, I can just be myself.
Isn't that what love really is?

12:52.204 --> 12:56.072
No. Love is hiding who
you really are at all times,

12:56.208 --> 12:57.869
even when
you're sleeping.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.375
Love is
wearing makeup to bed

12:59.512 --> 13:01.639
and going downstairs
to the Burger King to poop

13:01.781 --> 13:03.544
and hiding alcohol
in perfume bottles.

13:03.682 --> 13:04.580
That's love.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.617
Ugh.
That just sounds hard.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.242
Being with Dennis is easy.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.547
If you give in to it,

13:09.688 --> 13:12.555
you just start to feel
kind of numb and warm, and...

13:12.691 --> 13:13.953
then you just get sleepy.

13:14.093 --> 13:15.060
It's not that bad.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.525
That's exactly
what they say it's like

13:16.662 --> 13:17.720
when you freeze to death.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.428
Blurgh.

13:23.002 --> 13:26.233
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Look at... There I am.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.067
Oh.
Is that really you?

13:28.207 --> 13:30.698
Yeah, me and the boys.
Yeah.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.037
Boy.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.043
Men were men back then,
I'll tell ya.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.081
If you wanted to do something
private with another man...

13:37.216 --> 13:38.240
it wasn't gay.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.011
No.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.450
It was just two men...

13:42.588 --> 13:45.216
celebrating
each other's strength.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.527
I'm in!

13:51.664 --> 13:53.029
Jackie D!

13:53.165 --> 13:55.463
Nixon's ghost convinced my ghost
to help the GOP.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.365
God bless that wiretapping
bastard! This is great!

13:58.504 --> 14:00.267
We've got to shoot a couple
of commercials right away.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.430
The McCain dinner
is Saturday!

14:01.574 --> 14:02.871
Sounds good,
but I can't talk now.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.408
I've got to get my wallet
out of the toaster. Okay.

14:08.714 --> 14:09.578
Yeah?
You like that?

14:09.715 --> 14:11.706
<i>Maybe a couple photos where
you don't give the thumbs-up?</i>

14:11.851 --> 14:13.045
No, that's my thing,
dummy.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.449
Know what? Doesn't matter.
Just getting through the week.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.385
You know, it's all
really happening for me.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.286
My people.
My city.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.722
My woman.
Huh?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.657
I tell you, everything is
starting to go my way, Liz,

14:22.795 --> 14:24.023
'cause I'm a man of action.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.758
Yeah, I got to stop overthinking
everything like I used to.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.162
That was
never your problem.

14:30.636 --> 14:31.603
Aww! Aww!
Aww! Aww!

14:31.737 --> 14:32.931
Elizabeth Sarah Lemon...

14:33.072 --> 14:34.266
That's not my middle name.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.169
...will you marry me?

14:36.308 --> 14:38.242
Oh, God.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.680
Wake up, dummy.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.186
Hey, space cadet.
Down here.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.311
Will you marry me
or what?

14:51.457 --> 14:52.981
No! No way!

14:53.125 --> 14:55.150
You don't know this guy!

14:55.294 --> 14:57.319
He is not the man
you think he is!

14:57.463 --> 14:59.192
Hey, what is
your problem, Liz?

14:59.331 --> 15:00.992
I could get any girl here
I want.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.363
And not just the fatties
and the butter-faces.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.629
Shut up, crowd!

15:05.771 --> 15:08.865
I command you,
as the Subway Hero, shut up!

15:09.008 --> 15:09.997
Unbelievable, Liz.
Hey.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.166
You know,
I don't need this.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.538
You know
a stripper offered

15:12.678 --> 15:14.543
<i>to give me a squeezer
last night... a white stripper.</i>

15:14.680 --> 15:16.545
Ugh! Thank God
I didn't fall for this.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.411
You are not a hero.
You're a loser.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.108
And you will always be
a loser!

15:20.252 --> 15:21.116
<i>Oh, I'm the loser.</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:23.050
I guess I'm the one who totally
missed catching the puck

15:23.188 --> 15:24.120
at that Islanders game.

15:24.256 --> 15:24.950
You suck!

15:25.090 --> 15:26.057
No, you suck!

15:26.191 --> 15:28.455
And so do
all New York-based sports teams!

15:28.594 --> 15:30.653
Liz, don't say anything
you can't take back!

15:31.697 --> 15:34.257
My fellow Blackmericans...

15:35.768 --> 15:39.067
Hey, Jack... can I just
say "black Americans"?

15:39.204 --> 15:41.536
There's no such thing
as Blackmericans.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.699
That's great.
That's why you're here.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.307
My fellow black Americans,

15:47.446 --> 15:51.382
Dr. King once had a dream...
a dream that we all share...

15:51.517 --> 15:54.418
to build a 200-foot-high wall
to keep Mexico out.

15:54.553 --> 15:57.215
And he also hated
the estate tax.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.784
Unbelievable.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.759
Jack, I don't know
about this. What's wrong?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.061
I get it...
The Republican Party means

16:10.202 --> 16:13.103
less taxes, more guns,
and the end of the gun tax.

16:13.238 --> 16:13.795
Go on.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.669
But everybody isn't
forward-thinking like I am.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.299
No matter what,

16:18.444 --> 16:21.277
Blackmericans are gonna
always vote Democrat.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.005
They will, won't they?

16:23.148 --> 16:23.944
Mm-hmm.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.542
Unless...

16:27.720 --> 16:29.551
<i>Black people, don't vote!</i>

16:29.688 --> 16:31.383
<i>Just don't do it!</i>

16:31.523 --> 16:33.388
<i>In the amount of time
it takes for you to vote,</i>

16:33.525 --> 16:35.152
<i>you could play three games
of pool.</i>

16:35.294 --> 16:36.386
<i>Three!</i>

16:36.528 --> 16:37.756
<i>Now, that's fresh.</i>

16:37.896 --> 16:40.797
<i>I'm Tracy Jordan,
and I improved this message.</i>

16:40.933 --> 16:43.060
<i>Paid for by the Committee
to Re- Invade Vietnam.</i>

16:45.304 --> 16:47.033
Sure feels good to make
a difference, doesn't it?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.264
Yes, it does.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.341
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:50.476 --> 16:54.412
Nixon asked me to take some
stuff out of his Wikipedia page.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.248
Hey, Jack, I'm sorry.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.783
This Dennis thing
is not gonna work.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.715
I can't even be in the same room
as that idiot.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.446
Save it for your iVillage blog,
Lemon.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.454
Dennis is off the show.
I booked the 911 Bird.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.890
Winston here dialed 911
with his beak and said "fire,"

17:09.028 --> 17:10.494
but only because he didn't know
the word for "rape. "

17:10.628 --> 17:11.617
Well, it's fine with me,

17:11.763 --> 17:13.595
but we've been promoting
the Subway Hero.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.222
The Subway Hero's 15 minutes
are up.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.061
<i>Now, if you could let him know
that, that would be great.</i>

17:17.202 --> 17:20.137
Hey, you're not bumping Dennis
for my benefit, are you?

17:20.271 --> 17:21.239
Of course I am.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.432
I base all my business decisions
on your needs.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.803
That's why
GE's gonna be introducing

17:24.943 --> 17:26.467
the Pocket Deep Fryer.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.103
That would sell, by the way.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.079
Well,
when we sobered up,

17:34.219 --> 17:35.811
we realized
we'd eaten the peacock

17:35.954 --> 17:38.684
<i>and we put the ham
in Pat Weaver's office.</i>

17:38.824 --> 17:40.052
I'll tell ya...

17:40.192 --> 17:41.955
Mr. Bright?
Huh?

17:42.094 --> 17:46.656
With all due respect,
I can't listen to this anymore.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.030
I love television, sir,
and you are ruining it.

17:50.169 --> 17:51.602
I love television, too.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.863
But I want to tell you
something.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.064
If you're gonna make
something beautiful,

17:55.207 --> 17:56.674
you got to make
a mess of it first.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.300
I don't care whether
you're making an omelet, a baby,

17:59.445 --> 18:01.003
or... or a television show.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.171
Things are
gonna get weird.

18:03.315 --> 18:06.978
Well, I'm afraid the biz
has changed since your time.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.882
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:09.021 --> 18:11.546
I'm off to Chinatown to pick up
some human growth hormone

18:11.690 --> 18:13.487
so that Mr. Jordan's tigers
don't realize

18:13.625 --> 18:14.887
that he's aging and...

18:15.027 --> 18:18.292
Ohhh, my.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.160
See?
There's your weird.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.130
A bird?!

18:22.267 --> 18:23.928
Dennis,
I'm very sorry.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.559
Oh, really?
Why?

18:25.704 --> 18:27.569
It seems like all that stuff
you said came true.

18:27.706 --> 18:28.570
<i>I am a loser.</i>

18:28.707 --> 18:30.004
My mall appearance
got canceled,

18:30.142 --> 18:31.769
the... the Mighty Ducks
are mad at me

18:31.910 --> 18:33.537
'cause I left the Stanley Cup
on a water taxi.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.044
You know,
I thought I'd done

18:35.180 --> 18:37.011
something good enough
to get you back.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.783
I can only imagine
the classic song

18:40.919 --> 18:43.012
I'm gonna write
after this.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.650
That is
a very disturbing story.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.228
Aw, you're just
saying that.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.330
No, no, no, no.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.523
No, you've seen some stuff,
I'll tell you.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.226
Oh. Well, this one's dating
a "Dateline" predator.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.599
Exonerated.
And we're not dating.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.330
You don't know what
you're talking about, Kenneth.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.273
Boy, that's one mouthy
sandwich girl, isn't it?

19:15.487 --> 19:18.923
It was on a subway platform
just like this.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.548
On a night...
just like this.

19:21.693 --> 19:24.059
It's still daytime.
We're inside.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.664
Know what the worst thing about
this whole hero thing has been?

19:26.798 --> 19:28.060
It's that I got a chance
to see

19:28.200 --> 19:29.861
what my life could have
really been like.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.095
You know, like, if the
beeper business had taken off

19:32.237 --> 19:33.864
or I hadn't failed
the firefighter exam.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.439
You failed
the firefighter exam?

19:35.574 --> 19:37.405
Yeah, it's totally biased
against the Irish, you know.

19:39.211 --> 19:42.578
You know, Liz, being with you
and being a hero

19:42.714 --> 19:45.239
are the two greatest things
that's ever happened to me.

19:45.384 --> 19:49.753
And I just, uh...
I just wish I could get it back.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.053
You're gonna be fine.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.356
If reality TV
has taught us anything,

19:58.497 --> 20:01.330
it's that you can't keep people
with no shame down.

20:01.466 --> 20:04.196
I really believe
that you are gonna do

20:04.336 --> 20:07.430
something else great
in your life.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.078
Dennis Duffy, don't you dare.
No, no. Just work with me here.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.272
Just go limp. It'll be phenomenal.
You can't do this twice.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.610
No! No, no, no, no, no! Come on, Liz!

20:18.750 --> 20:20.684
Aw, damn!
It's the wrong track.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.150
Stupid express!

20:22.287 --> 20:24.187
You thought it was this track,
too, didn't you? Jackass!

20:24.323 --> 20:25.915
Wow! Come on!
It was just a goof!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.821
Never again!
Never!

20:27.960 --> 20:30.155
You'll be back, Liz Lemon.
You'll be back.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.557
Ugh.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.361
You'll be back, dummy.
