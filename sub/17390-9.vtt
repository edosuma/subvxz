WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.503
Ugh, Don, you have got
to get over this.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.271
I'm not buying you a Cinnabon

00:06.273 --> 00:08.674
every time
we go see our accountant.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.210
It's right downstairs.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.578
I could smell it
the whole meeting.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.246
Now I'm just

00:14.248 --> 00:16.348
sitting here eating an orange,
like a hippie.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.783
ANDI:
Hey, babe.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.085
Hi, Don. Hi.
Oh, hey, honey.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.287
I've got some good
news for you.
Yeah?

00:22.289 --> 00:23.689
You know that, uh, fundraiser
at my hospital

00:23.691 --> 00:25.124
that we're going to
this weekend?

00:25.126 --> 00:26.191
Oh, yeah, yeah. That party.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.127
(coughs)
Ooh.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.396
Where'd that cough come from?

00:31.298 --> 00:32.598
(coughs)

00:32.600 --> 00:34.600
Whoa.
I hope it's not contagious,

00:34.602 --> 00:37.202
'cause I really am looking
forward to putting on a suit

00:37.204 --> 00:38.704
and talking
to a bunch of strangers.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.639
(coughs)

00:40.641 --> 00:43.776
That does sound
like a pretty bad fake cough.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.278
Should I call a fake ambulance

00:46.280 --> 00:49.148
and have some fake doctors
take a look at you?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.150
You think I would fake
being sick to get out

00:51.152 --> 00:52.217
of going to your fundraiser?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.319
I am so offended. I...

00:54.321 --> 00:57.723
I don't think I can go
to the fundraiser anymore.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.591
You're cute. Are you done?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.560
Yeah, I'm done.
Okay.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.430
The good news I was gonna tell
you is you don't have to go.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.170
Really?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.404
Okay,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.206
when you say I don't have to go,

01:14.208 --> 01:16.742
do you mean
I<i> really</i> don't have to go

01:16.744 --> 01:18.477
or I don't
have to go

01:18.479 --> 01:21.246
but I<i> should</i> go,

01:21.248 --> 01:22.481
unless I want to hear about this
a month later

01:22.483 --> 01:24.483
in some completely unrelated
argument?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.752
You know what? I'm going.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.222
No, you really don't have to go.
Marcy said she'd go with me.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.190
Don't take my wife.

01:32.827 --> 01:35.561
You should make Adam go.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.263
What are you doing?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.299
I'll tell you
what I'm not doing:

01:40.301 --> 01:41.433
eating a Cinnabon.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.136
My God, every week
with this guy.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.571
Why don't you just go
get one yourself?

01:45.573 --> 01:48.107
He says it tastes better
when I buy it.

01:48.109 --> 01:51.743
Okay, but, seriously, babe, you
are off the hook for the party.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.746
Marcy will keep me company.
And, plus, all my work friends

01:54.748 --> 01:58.283
from the lab will be there.
You know, Amy, Sarah, and Bob.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.886
Oh. That sounds great.
Uh, who was that last one?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.355
I didn't catch her name.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.590
Bob. He's a he.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.358
We watch the same cooking shows.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.794
Oh, and if I get
behind on an episode,

02:08.796 --> 02:11.530
he puts me in coffee jail.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.466
And that means
I can't have any coffee

02:14.468 --> 02:15.767
until I catch up.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.469
Ooh.
Yeah.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.472
Everyone at work thinks
it's hilarious.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.408
He sounds like a great guy.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.177
Huh. Wow.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.279
You have come a long way.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.681
You know, there was a time that
you would've been very jealous

02:29.683 --> 02:31.216
that I had a male work friend.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.152
Oh. No. Not anymore.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.653
No, I left
my jealous days behind

02:34.655 --> 02:37.389
with my jean shorts
and my mullet.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.491
I am a modern man now.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.493
(chuckles)

02:41.495 --> 02:43.629
Yep. That's right.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.698
Don, you want to help me
carry this out to my truck?

02:51.639 --> 02:53.639
I don't know
if you noticed,

02:53.641 --> 02:55.407
but it doesn't really take
two guys to carry this.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.477
I don't like this Bob guy
one bit.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.245
First of all, his name's Bob.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.314
It's the same backwards
as it is forwards.

03:02.316 --> 03:06.485
Y-You can't trust
somebody like that.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.886
You mean like Mom?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.354
Exactly.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.492
Who cares if some guy
likes Andi's TV shows?

03:13.494 --> 03:15.961
I do. 'Cause it's a move, man.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.397
I used the same one on Andi
when we were dating.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.332
(gasps)
"You love<i> Ally McBeal?</i>

03:20.334 --> 03:21.466
"I love<i> Ally McBeal.</i>

03:21.468 --> 03:23.635
Let's take off our pants!"

03:23.637 --> 03:26.338
I think if I tried
that move on Marcy,

03:26.340 --> 03:28.440
I'd just end up
washing her pants.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.942
Here's the problem,

03:29.944 --> 03:32.477
Andi was home with the kids
for a long time.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.313
Now she's back at work. I mean,

03:34.315 --> 03:37.783
you put that honey out there,
bears are gonna show up.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.452
I got an idea--
just don't be jealous.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.588
I can't help it.
Yes, I am sophisticated

03:42.590 --> 03:44.590
on the outside, okay?

03:44.592 --> 03:47.659
But on the inside,
I'm an animal, just like you.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.962
We're a couple
of wild stallions.
Mm.

03:49.964 --> 03:52.297
Okay, then be jealous

03:52.299 --> 03:53.999
and just tell Andi
you don't want her
hanging out with that guy.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.434
I can't do that either.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.236
She hates when I get jealous.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.404
Remember when we were dating
and that guy in the bar

03:59.406 --> 04:00.606
put his arm around her?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.507
Yeah. You put him
in the trash can.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.443
Upside-down.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.479
I'd seen that in cartoons
but never real life.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.449
I actually got the idea
from a cartoon.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.552
But she was so mad,
she broke up with me.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.886
So when we got back together,

04:14.888 --> 04:16.622
I promised
I was done being jealous.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.558
I'm not done.
I'm livin' a lie, Don.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.860
Hey, honey, um, how do you feel

04:21.862 --> 04:23.428
about a kale salad for dinner?

04:23.430 --> 04:25.264
You know I love kale.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.799
Huh? I am a modern man

04:27.801 --> 04:30.535
who loves his kale.
(chuckles)

04:30.537 --> 04:32.571
Okay.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.340
Now I got to choke down
another bowl of rabbit food.

04:35.342 --> 04:38.577
What happened to you, man?
Look,

04:38.579 --> 04:40.579
do me a favor,
if you see me getting jealous,

04:40.581 --> 04:42.547
you got to do something
to stop me.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.549
Can I get physical?
Yes. Usual rules:

04:44.551 --> 04:46.551
above the waist and-- I can't
believe I have to say this--

04:46.553 --> 04:48.353
no biting.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.455
A brother waits a lifetime
for something like this.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.591
Okay. Good. Yeah.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.993
¶ ¶

05:03.037 --> 05:04.936
ANDI:
<i> Thanks for meeting me, Marcy.</i>

05:04.938 --> 05:06.872
I love visiting you
at the hospital.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.840
We haven't had lunch
since you went back to work.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.909
In the future,
is it okay if I bring wine?

05:10.911 --> 05:13.945
Well, you can't bring a bottle.
But if you bring a thermos,

05:13.947 --> 05:15.814
whatever's in it's
your business.
Oh.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.949
So it's church rules.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.985
Sure.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.355
Hey, um, I wanted
to run something by you.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.756
Hmm.
Um,

05:24.758 --> 05:27.592
yesterday, I told Adam
that I had a guy friend at work,

05:27.594 --> 05:30.429
Bob, and he seemed fine with it.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.596
What a jerk!

05:31.598 --> 05:33.065
I know!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.533
I mean, at first,
I was... I was proud of him,

05:34.535 --> 05:37.836
but then I started thinking,
why is he so fine with it?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.571
No, no.
This is totally unacceptable.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.406
You deserve a little jealousy,
okay?

05:41.408 --> 05:43.675
If I was your husband,
Bob would be in a suitcase

05:43.677 --> 05:45.677
at the bottom of a river.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.347
Aw. That's sweet, Marcy.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.482
I don't know.
Maybe it's normal.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.051
I mean, Adam and I have been
married for 15 years.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.455
And the other night,
we... we made, um,

05:56.457 --> 05:59.725
you know, a date to fool around,
and we both fell asleep.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.494
Oh.
Yeah. That's the first time
that's ever happened.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.563
It wasn't during, was it?
'Cause if Don mistimes

06:04.565 --> 06:06.398
his blood pressure pill,
I'm not crawling out

06:06.400 --> 06:07.899
from under that
until the morning.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.670
No, it wasn't
quite like that.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.105
I don't know.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.607
Maybe I should just talk
to Adam about it.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.142
And, what, get pity jealousy?

06:17.144 --> 06:19.478
Is that what you want?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.780
Oh, you know what,
I want the real thing.
Well, if you want

06:21.782 --> 06:23.448
to mess with a man's head,
you are having lunch

06:23.450 --> 06:24.483
with the right person.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.518
Okay, here's
what you do:

06:26.520 --> 06:28.453
you tell him
that Bob is texting you.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.855
That'll wake Adam up.

06:29.857 --> 06:33.125
But Bob's my boss.
He doesn't text me.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.026
You know who doesn't know that?
Adam.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.129
Hey, Adam, I just got

06:37.131 --> 06:40.065
the funniest text from Bob.
(chuckles)

06:42.136 --> 06:44.403
Damn.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.537
(chuckles)

06:45.539 --> 06:48.440
Your texts are too much, Bob.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.510
Aw, come on.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.145
Hey, uh, careful you
don't shock yourself,

06:53.147 --> 06:55.013
there's a bare spot
on that cord.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.014
(buzzing)

06:56.016 --> 06:57.416
(yells)

06:57.418 --> 06:58.550
(laughing)
I touched it.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.818
I was gonna fix it,

06:59.820 --> 07:02.187
but I knew
you were gonna do that.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.856
Hold on, my heart
stopped beating.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.526
There it goes.
Okay, we're back.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.161
Yeah, hey, you didn't tell Marcy

07:09.163 --> 07:10.595
what we talked about, did you?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.464
About Andi and that guy at work?

07:12.466 --> 07:13.565
Oh, don't tell me it's a secret.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.699
I cannot keep a secret
from Marcy.

07:14.701 --> 07:15.684
She senses it,

07:15.685 --> 07:16.668
like an old sailor
senses a storm.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.670
But you lie to her all the time.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.138
And she catches me all the time.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.440
Well, that's not true.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.674
She still doesn't know about

07:22.676 --> 07:24.075
our secret fishing boat
up at the lake.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.911
Both our wives are in the dark
on that one.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.679
Well, I was only able
to keep that a secret

07:27.681 --> 07:29.614
because I never paid
for my half of the boat.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.183
Not my boat, not my secret.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.784
See how I did that?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.753
Hmm, yeah, someone should
study your brain.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.489
Okay, just keep your mouth shut.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.657
Hey, babe,
Huh?

07:38.659 --> 07:39.658
dinner's gonna be
ready soon.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.659
(laughing)

07:40.661 --> 07:42.694
I'm sorry I'm laughing. I just--

07:42.696 --> 07:44.529
I got the funniest text
from Bob.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.198
(Andi laughing)

07:46.200 --> 07:48.633
You know, i-it's actually weird
that he's funny,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.035
because, I mean,
you wouldn't think that

07:50.037 --> 07:51.736
someone that does triathlons

07:51.738 --> 07:53.171
would have a sense of humor.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.141
Wow, he runs,
he bikes, he swims.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.876
I hope the sharks don't get him.
(chuckles)

07:58.879 --> 08:00.645
You know, you should hear

08:00.647 --> 08:02.747
his stories about
trying to find bicycle pants

08:02.749 --> 08:04.616
that are big enough
to fit his muscular thighs--

08:04.618 --> 08:06.485
I mean, they're hilarious.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.619
(chuckling)

08:07.621 --> 08:09.754
And touching.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.490
Okay...

08:11.492 --> 08:12.924
(buzzing)
(yelps)

08:14.895 --> 08:16.895
Oh, what happened there?

08:16.897 --> 08:18.129
You seem mad.

08:18.131 --> 08:22.100
N-no. No, no. No, Don

08:22.102 --> 08:23.602
accidentally shocked me...

08:23.604 --> 08:25.136
too much.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.772
Oh, okay, well,

08:27.774 --> 08:29.508
I guess I'll just go
finish dinner.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.141
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.043
Pound that
chicken flat.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.813
Did you hear what she said?

08:34.815 --> 08:38.049
Bob and his giant thighs
are texting her now.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.818
I'm starting to root for Bob,

08:39.820 --> 08:41.152
he sounds like a winner.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.790
I got no reaction out of Adam!

08:45.792 --> 08:47.726
I mean, I did everything
short of

08:47.728 --> 08:49.661
telling him that
Bob and I were slow dancing

08:49.663 --> 08:51.830
in the cafeteria.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.899
Well, maybe you just have
to accept the fact

08:53.901 --> 08:55.166
that things are different now.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.603
(scoffs)
Marcy,

08:58.605 --> 08:59.905
I did not call you

08:59.907 --> 09:01.840
to get a levelheaded
and fair assessment

09:01.842 --> 09:03.742
of the situation.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.176
You're right, my bad.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.044
Okay,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.312
maybe I can get some intel

09:07.314 --> 09:08.780
from Don,
but in the meantime,

09:08.782 --> 09:10.248
you-you got to
kick it up a notch.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.750
It's like with dogs,

09:11.751 --> 09:13.251
okay? You can't just
put the food out

09:13.253 --> 09:14.853
and expect that they'll find it.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.721
You got to shake the bowl.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.957
Oh, I'm gonna shake my bowl.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.593
Wait, am I the food

09:21.595 --> 09:23.328
or the bowl?

09:23.330 --> 09:26.331
Well, I'm not the dog, am I?

09:26.333 --> 09:29.935
This guy Bob is definitely
flirting with Andi now.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.169
Well, are you flirting with her?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.771
Yeah,

09:32.773 --> 09:34.739
sometimes I walk around
with my robe open.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.876
That's not flirting,
that's just sloppy.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.744
You need to get
back in the game.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.780
Hey, text her a sexy picture.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.081
Really?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.816
Yeah, it's called sexting.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.785
(scoffs)
What do you know about sexting?

09:46.787 --> 09:49.187
I like to dip my toe
in popular culture.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.723
(scoffs)
Actually,

09:51.725 --> 09:53.625
a picture's
not a bad idea.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.060
I think getting
shocked by that cord

09:55.062 --> 09:57.729
might have fired a neuron
or two up in your attic.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.064
Look, all you need to do
is remind her

09:59.066 --> 10:00.799
that she's got this
slightly faded stud

10:00.801 --> 10:02.200
waiting for her at home.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.368
Well, if I'm faded,

10:03.370 --> 10:04.769
then what the
hell are you?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.137
I do all right.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.244
This is stupid;
I feel ridiculous.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.281
I could tell.
I'm not feeling the sexy.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.083
Look, I'm gonna give you
one smoldering look,

10:18.085 --> 10:19.851
because I know that
works for me.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.853
And you're gonna take
a picture on my phone,

10:21.855 --> 10:23.788
and then we are never
gonna speak of this again.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.890
You ready?
Yeah.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.959
(sighs)

10:33.333 --> 10:35.767
Okay. Actually,
that's not bad.
Oh.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.235
Okay, I'm gonna send it.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.671
And... oops.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.807
Who's Alicia?
What?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.810
I accidentally sent it to
someone named Alicia Rodriguez.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.779
That's Emme's
kindergarten teacher.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.681
Her name is right next
to Andi's on your phone.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.182
These fat fingers,
I'm telling you.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.951
That picture's gonna go around
the whole school.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.719
I can fix it,
I can fix it.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.688
Hold on... Oops.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.789
Oops, again?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.424
I was texting to say sorry,

10:59.426 --> 11:01.359
and it autocorrected
to salami.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.661
Give me that.

11:08.935 --> 11:09.968
Okay, kids.
Let's move it along.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.936
We're wheels up in five minutes.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.939
(laughs)
Sorry my shoes are so loud.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.341
High heels.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.146
You never wear high heels
to work.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.714
Well, I dressed up.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.282
Why?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.251
Well, it's the finale
of the cooking show

11:26.253 --> 11:27.719
that Bob and I watch,

11:27.721 --> 11:28.753
so he's taking me out

11:28.755 --> 11:29.988
for a, you know,

11:29.990 --> 11:32.090
a special lunch
to celebrate.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.792
Just the two of us.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.033
Got to love that Bob.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.935
Great.
Great.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.136
(door closes)

11:45.138 --> 11:47.205
(sighs)

11:51.111 --> 11:53.445
Oh. Uh,
I'm sorry, buddy.

11:53.447 --> 11:56.081
Let me clean you up
a little bit.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.087
Okay, turn around.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.422
Let's just go, uh, up.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.026
So, um,

12:08.028 --> 12:09.894
has Adam ever said
anything to you

12:09.896 --> 12:11.196
about Andi's friend, Bob?

12:11.198 --> 12:13.932
Let me think.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.034
Are you saying "Bob" or "Rob"?

12:16.036 --> 12:19.070
Bob. B-O-B.
Todd?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.507
Are you trying to hide
something from me?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.142
No. And you're not gonna
get the secret out of me.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.376
I'm like a rock.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.911
So there is a secret.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.181
Okay, I see what I did there.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.951
Okay. Spill it, Don.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.052
Fine. You want the secret?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.187
Adam's gonna kill me, but okay.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.757
We have a secret fishing boat

12:38.759 --> 12:41.392
we never told you about.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.061
You want to know my secret?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.263
I've known about that boat
for six months.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.199
Wow, no keeping anything
from you.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.234
So,

12:49.236 --> 12:51.803
nothing about Bob?

12:51.805 --> 12:52.804
Rod?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.139
Don!

12:54.141 --> 12:55.206
Well, I'm Don.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.245
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dad.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.412
Bye, Dad.
ADAM: Bye-bye, bye.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.047
Have a good day.
All right, bye.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.415
(chuckling)

13:04.417 --> 13:06.417
Good morning, Burns.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.355
Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.024
(imitates motor revving)

13:14.361 --> 13:17.061
I'm glad everyone enjoyed
the motorcycle picture.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.230
Yeah, we had a little
caption contest.

13:19.232 --> 13:23.234
Mine was, "Born to be
wild-ly embarrassed."

13:23.236 --> 13:25.837
Okay, that picture was
supposed to be for my wife,

13:25.839 --> 13:28.339
but mistakes were made.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.342
Why are you taking pictures
of yourself on a motorcycle?

13:31.344 --> 13:34.045
Besides to delight me.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.380
I'm not talking to you about it.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.081
From now on, I'm not talking
to anyone about it,

13:37.083 --> 13:38.449
except Andi, which is what
I should have done

13:38.451 --> 13:39.884
in the first place.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.152
So, I'm gonna go
find her at work

13:41.154 --> 13:42.353
and settle this whole thing.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.822
All right, and I'm see
how much it costs

13:43.824 --> 13:45.290
to rent a billboard.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.228
Okay, Bob, I finished
processing these samples

13:50.230 --> 13:51.830
and I'm gonna go
grab a cup of coffee.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.831
You want some?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.065
Uh...
(chuckles)

13:54.067 --> 13:55.400
oxygen potassium.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.135
What?
From the periodic table.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.837
They're "O" and "K."

13:58.839 --> 14:00.104
Oh.
(laughing)

14:00.106 --> 14:01.306
(laughing)
That's a good one,

14:01.308 --> 14:02.407
Bob.
Yeah.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.242
Yeah, yeah,
Oxygen...

14:04.244 --> 14:05.376
yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.380
You must be Bob.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.615
Yeah, that's right.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.116
Yeah.
(chuckling)

14:12.118 --> 14:14.519
Yeah...

14:17.490 --> 14:19.224
Yeah,

14:19.226 --> 14:21.326
let's get a look at
those muscular thighs.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.294
Huh?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.263
They're not so great.
You want to see my thighs?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.631
Uh, no.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.234
Let's put our thighs
against each other.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.569
Thigh to thigh.
Come on, Bob, let's do this.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.637
Who are you?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.172
I'm Andi's husband,
now hold still.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.340
No, you first.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.310
Okay, listen, pal.
I don't like you

14:39.312 --> 14:42.313
watching TV shows
with my wife.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.282
Okay? I don't like you

14:44.284 --> 14:46.017
having special lunches with her,

14:46.019 --> 14:48.453
or making her wear high heels.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.022
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.924
Oh, look at that, you're
right next to a big trash can.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.092
You ever watch cartoons?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.362
Adam?

14:57.364 --> 14:58.596
W-What are you doing here?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.231
I'm just letting this guy know

15:00.233 --> 15:02.100
it's not okay
to text another man's wife.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.601
I never texted her.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.604
Oh, you just keep walking
into problems, Bob.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.340
Andi told me about the texts.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.575
Right, Andi?
Andi, I'm right, right?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.110
Andi, am I right?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.146
Okay, um...
(clears throat)

15:15.148 --> 15:16.414
...funny story.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.949
Um...
(clears throat)

15:17.951 --> 15:19.484
I-I may have mentioned

15:19.486 --> 15:21.185
that Bob was texting me...

15:21.187 --> 15:22.120
(laughs obnoxiously)

15:22.122 --> 15:23.187
...but that was a--

15:23.189 --> 15:25.123
a slight exaggeration

15:25.125 --> 15:27.158
in-in the sense that, um,

15:27.160 --> 15:30.128
h-he never did anything
like that, ever.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.298
Where's the funny part
to that story?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.300
Oh, well, um,
the funny part is,

15:35.302 --> 15:37.402
he's my boss,
Bob Thompson.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.305
That is funny.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.006
(laughing)

15:42.008 --> 15:44.242
(laughing):
Well, that is funny.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.210
And I hope that one day,

15:46.212 --> 15:47.312
we'll can look back on this

15:47.314 --> 15:48.980
and laugh.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.148
(chuckling)

15:50.150 --> 15:52.450
I'll do whatever you want.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.453
A-And I also hope that
this little misunderstanding

15:55.455 --> 15:57.722
won't cause a problem
with Andi's job.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.358
No, no, her--
her job is safe.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.160
Uh, we may tighten up our

16:02.162 --> 16:04.295
"no spouses at work" policy.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.100
(Adam and Bob chuckling)

16:09.102 --> 16:10.335
Oh...

16:10.337 --> 16:11.469
Andi, what are you doing to me?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.470
Well, I...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.372
I don't know.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.140
(sighing)
Okay,

16:16.142 --> 16:19.344
w-when I mentioned that
I had a guy friend at work,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.012
you didn't seem to care.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.714
Didn't care?

16:22.716 --> 16:24.248
Well, I cared a lot!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.450
I was going crazy!

16:25.452 --> 16:27.185
Well, why didn't you
say something?

16:27.187 --> 16:30.321
Because you hate it
when I get jealous.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.090
Well, I hated it when
we were in our 20s

16:32.092 --> 16:33.725
and guys were hitting on me
all the time.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.193
Guys were hitting on you
all the time?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.394
Who were these guys?
Are they tall?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.196
See,

16:38.198 --> 16:39.430
that's what I was looking for.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.999
What?

16:41.001 --> 16:44.168
Well, a little jealousy is nice.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.305
Wha-- since when?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.341
Apparently, the older I get,
the more I'm gonna need.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.378
Good...

16:53.380 --> 16:55.046
'cause I am tired of pretending

16:55.048 --> 16:56.414
to be someone I'm not.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.715
I'm a jealous man.

16:58.752 --> 16:59.751
And I'll tell you another thing:

16:59.753 --> 17:01.219
I don't like kale.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.520
I don't like kale, either.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.756
Then why are we eating
yard clippings?

17:04.758 --> 17:07.191
Because we're supposed
to like it.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.394
Just like I'm supposed to get
my confidence from the inside

17:09.396 --> 17:11.763
and you're supposed to be
so secure in our marriage

17:11.765 --> 17:13.564
that you don't care
who I'm friends with.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.200
That sounds like

17:16.202 --> 17:17.735
something they do in France!

17:19.139 --> 17:20.338
This is America, damn it.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.441
We are jealous,
insecure, kale haters.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.777
I love you.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.113
I love you, too.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.449
Oh, by the way,

17:31.451 --> 17:34.519
I texted Mrs. Rodriguez
a sexy photo of myself.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.421
And, uh, the word "salami."

17:36.423 --> 17:38.156
So, there might be
some fallout from that.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.824
But, uh, okay, here we go.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.235
So, after all of this,

17:51.237 --> 17:53.604
we have decided to be completely
honest with each other.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.807
That's right,
no more secrets.
Mm.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.742
I like that, Don.
We should do that, too.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.710
Hey, I'm way ahead
of you, baby.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.846
That's why I told you
about Adam's secret boat.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.351
Don!

18:07.353 --> 18:08.519
W-What boat?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.521
You said there's no secrets.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.490
I meant no<i> new</i> secrets.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.326
Wait, you bought a boat
without telling me?

18:15.328 --> 18:16.727
Ooh, that's bad.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.213
Oh, yeah?

18:19.214 --> 18:20.730
Marcy, Don bought
your engagement ring

18:20.733 --> 18:22.467
from a mortician.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.369
What?

18:25.371 --> 18:27.572
Oh, that's worse!

18:27.574 --> 18:30.808
Hey, the dearly departed
didn't need it anymore.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.742
It's not like they

18:31.744 --> 18:33.511
cut it off her finger.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.812
(mouthing):
They did.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.655
(Adam sighs)

18:46.426 --> 18:48.226
(laughing)

18:48.228 --> 18:49.778
What's so funny?

18:49.779 --> 18:51.329
Have you looked at your
passenger side door lately?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.396
No, why?

18:52.398 --> 18:54.665
What happened there?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.669
Don.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.343
I bet that's payback
for the mortician.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.713
(laughing): "Honk if
you think I'm sexy."

19:10.617 --> 19:12.817
Hey, I didn't get
a single honk!

19:12.819 --> 19:15.520
Oh...
I'm going back out there.
