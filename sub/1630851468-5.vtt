00:19.680 --> 00:21.160
<i>Breathing in...</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:25.440
<i>...letting go.</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.200
<i>Planning... Let go.</i>

00:29.080 --> 00:31.640
<i>Worrying... Let go.</i>

00:32.160 --> 00:35.000
<i>Three days ago I was like,</i>
<i>'Get me out of here.'</i>

00:45.400 --> 00:49.080
<i>A retreat, otherwise known</i>
<i>as 'delaying the inevitable'.</i>

00:49.440 --> 00:50.760
<i>Which is basically that</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:52.680
<i>everything had been going</i>
<i>to shit for...</i>

01:01.160 --> 01:02.280
Sorry.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.160
<i>Open your heart</i>
<i>to life?</i>

01:13.880 --> 01:16.520
<i>Eh, I'll settle</i>
<i>for a double espresso.</i>

01:22.400 --> 01:23.920
<i>Oh, hell.</i>

01:25.520 --> 01:26.560
Nathan.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.720
Did you know we teach
a walking meditation?

01:29.760 --> 01:33.040
No. Anton, I did not.
Appreciate the information.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.840
Well, there's a couple
of sessions this arvo.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.960
Just turn up.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.240
<i>No judgement.</i>

01:41.880 --> 01:43.920
<i>As in literally, no judgement.</i>

01:48.760 --> 01:50.480
<i>On the other hand...</i>

01:50.520 --> 01:52.840
<i>..when was the last time</i>
<i>you had a free holiday?</i>

01:54.880 --> 01:55.920
<i>So...</i>

01:55.960 --> 01:57.160
<i>here I am.</i>

01:58.360 --> 01:59.840
<i>Slow right down.</i>

02:00.480 --> 02:02.040
<i>Follow your breath.</i>

02:02.600 --> 02:04.200
<i>Catch your thoughts</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:06.120
<i>and calm the monkey mind.</i>

02:06.880 --> 02:08.720
<i>And then one breath later...</i>

02:08.760 --> 02:10.720
<i>more self-criticism.</i>

02:11.240 --> 02:13.240
<i>Hey, at least I'm noticing it.</i>

02:13.840 --> 02:15.520
<i>Oh, could that be the point?</i>

02:15.560 --> 02:16.800
Beautiful.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.280
You're an inspiration.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.760
Very Zen.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.120
A couple of days here, might
just be getting the hang of it.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.320
I've just arrived and I'm all...

02:28.160 --> 02:30.080
Mind is like a washing machine.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.440
Overdue my tune-up.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.520
Ah.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.080
I can highly recommend starting
with the breathing class.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.360
I thought for a moment there

02:36.400 --> 02:38.360
you were going to recommend
a good vintage.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.000
I...

02:40.600 --> 02:42.000
I'm Sylvia.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.160
Nathan.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.080
It's nice to meet you.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.400
Oh, this is my third time here.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.240
It's head and shoulders
above the rest.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.520
It's all very new to me.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.080
Well, you've chosen
the right place.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.400
And whatever you're doing,
Nathan, it is working.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.720
So far, so good.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.800
<i>Being in the moment.</i>

03:10.920 --> 03:14.120
<i>Acceptance opens up</i>
<i>possibilities.</i>

03:14.160 --> 03:16.880
<i>Avoidance closes them down.</i>

03:24.400 --> 03:25.960
- Hello.
- Oh!

03:26.000 --> 03:28.440
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, I was miles away.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.080
Just checking
if you need anything.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.200
If Dave needs anything?

03:31.240 --> 03:32.560
Dave?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.080
Ah well, Dave's
back at work today.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.880
No, how can he work?

03:35.920 --> 03:38.280
He's supervising Paddo,
'Just a half-day to start.'

03:38.320 --> 03:39.720
I thought the doctor said rest?

03:39.760 --> 03:41.320
Well no, he had a rest.
Yesterday.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.640
I mean, he's got one
wrist intact, who needs two?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.560
Dave I can...

03:47.600 --> 03:48.720
Got it.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.120
I'm alright, I'm alright.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.240
It's OK.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.560
I'm alright.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.120
I could be forgiven
for wondering

04:07.160 --> 04:08.320
why I rushed back up here.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.560
You know there's
special wrist braces

04:11.600 --> 04:12.720
for motocross riders?

04:12.760 --> 04:14.840
I mean, even teenagers
wear them apparently.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.080
- Oh, but not Dave.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.120
That's men for you, I guess.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.600
I'm sure he appreciates you
being back. He missed you.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.880
Has he? I'm not so sure.

04:23.920 --> 04:24.920
Do you want that?

04:25.760 --> 04:26.920
Nah.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.160
Why on earth I stored
all this stuff who would know.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.440
As you can see
I'm in a bit of a mood.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.640
Time for a walk,
if you feel like it?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.680
I just want to get rid
of all this stuff.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.240
OK well, don't toss these.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.240
Look, sourdough.
Fresh from the oven.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.800
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure you don't need a hand?

04:43.800 --> 04:46.080
- No, I'm fine.
- OK.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.240
<i>Begin to observe</i>
<i>the breath.</i>

04:57.040 --> 04:58.800
<i>And let go of control.</i>

04:59.240 --> 05:03.680
And this gal arrived all
stressed out and shellshocked.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.560
And then there was
the breathing class.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.720
The magic words,

05:06.760 --> 05:09.600
'For the next hour
you'll be lying down.'

05:10.560 --> 05:13.040
All exercise
should be taken prone.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.200
- Whatever way that works.
- You're a sporty spice.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.800
I'm not.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.440
You're in good shape, Nathan.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.800
I'm inspired.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.880
Hmm.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
Thanks.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.560
We should all play more,
don't you think?

05:28.680 --> 05:31.160
I always want to go on the swing
when I'm pushing Eddie.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.920
That's what this place
is missing, guest swings.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.600
- Yes.
- Ah, here he is.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.920
- Anton.
- Sylvia.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.480
Lovely to have you back.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.640
Is there anything
I can do for you?

05:43.320 --> 05:44.600
Swings.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.320
We think this place
would benefit

05:46.360 --> 05:47.520
from some swings.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.200
And by that I mean
actual swings.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.480
With silken ropes for you,
Madame.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.600
Some of these places
can be very earnest but...

05:57.320 --> 05:59.160
- ..Anton, he's really lovely.
- Yeah.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.920
Should we have
some lunch together?

06:01.960 --> 06:03.720
Throw ourselves
on the chickpea salad,

06:03.760 --> 06:05.080
drool over the mashed squash.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.560
Get down and dirty
in the quinoa.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.080
Yeah, yeah, why not?

06:08.120 --> 06:09.720
You have a contagious laugh.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.000
And, um,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.000
in answer to your question

06:16.560 --> 06:17.720
I am too.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.200
- Divorced.
- Oh.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.960
Dating and determined
to meet the right bloke.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.200
I should grab your number
before we leave.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.520
Yeah, sure.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.520
May I ask you something?

06:29.560 --> 06:31.600
- Open book.
- Are you...

06:32.360 --> 06:33.480
Is this...

06:34.840 --> 06:36.520
..are you hitting on me?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.320
No. Sorry.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.880
Of course I am.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.800
Carpe diem. We might just click.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.880
<i>Effortless breathing.</i>

06:49.440 --> 06:51.200
<i>One step at a time.</i>

06:51.240 --> 06:53.560
<i>And when in doubt, exhale.</i>

07:09.120 --> 07:10.480
I'm alright.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.680
Back in a tick.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.160
I'll just wait here.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.640
- Hi.
- Hey, how'd you go?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.040
Yeah, no swelling.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.760
Cast's a bit itchy
but that's about it.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.080
It's good to get the job done.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.520
Yeah well, I thought we'd have

07:30.560 --> 07:32.280
a nice sit down lunch
for a change.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.920
Tessa's brought some
lovely rolls.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.760
Uh, I might pack them up
and take them, if that's OK?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.000
Oh.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.200
Paddo's going for a ride
and I said I'd go watch.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.800
Not to get back on the horse

07:42.840 --> 07:44.560
but to think about
what it would be like

07:44.600 --> 07:45.680
to get back on the horse.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.440
Or you could try
a different horse.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.800
Just checking to see if...

07:49.840 --> 07:51.840
Ah, I'll leave you to it.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.720
- Nice one.
- Hang on.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.040
- Can I do that?
- No.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.120
It's no big deal. It's fine.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.120
- Ruby was crying at school.
- As if.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.400
Hey, Ruby.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.240
- Check this out.
- Yeah.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.560
- Bye, Ruby.
- See ya.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.680
- Can we get out of here?
- Are they your new friends?

08:23.720 --> 08:24.960
What are their names?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.640
They're called The Great Unwoke.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.480
- Oh, that's awful.
- It's because of Dad.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.360
Your dad's called three times
to say he's sorry.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.640
Until he said it was crap

08:39.640 --> 08:41.200
everyone really liked
my artwork.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.760
But now because
of what he said...

08:42.760 --> 08:43.960
Let's just stop
the blame.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.040
They're going,

08:45.080 --> 08:46.640
'It's just a painting
with dog turds

08:46.640 --> 08:48.240
and your dad
thinks you're crap,'

08:48.280 --> 08:49.440
which he actually said.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.160
Do you remember
what Charles told you?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.720
Yeah well, he wasn't there
when they were bullying me.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.040
That's true.
And this is horrible.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.760
But what if we look at it
from another angle?

09:00.360 --> 09:01.360
Like what?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.200
I'm trying to help you.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.040
Go on.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.280
You made a controversial work
and you wanted a reaction

09:09.320 --> 09:10.640
and that's what happened.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.760
Yeah, but not like this.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.080
No, not like this.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.640
It's all because of Dad, not me.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.280
You cried at something
your dad said

09:16.320 --> 09:17.760
but your dad
didn't make you cry.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.440
I think that's just semantics.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.760
I'm sorry?

09:20.840 --> 09:23.640
It's a word. Get over it.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.360
Time to go.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.000
When we get home
I need to go online

09:30.040 --> 09:32.120
and see what the people
who love me are saying.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.360
When we get home I need
to have some ice cream.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.880
Hey.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.280
You're early.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.720
Yeah, I thought we should talk.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.880
I've been saying that for days.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.400
Where are the kids?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.880
I'm trying to keep them
out the back.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.000
I guess you haven't seen this.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.880
Who does this?

10:20.640 --> 10:23.600
Bloody hell, where do these
dickheads spring up from?

10:24.240 --> 10:26.040
At least that's something
we agree on.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.760
I should call Mum.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.120
Plus she should know about...

10:34.440 --> 10:35.480
Whatever.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.440
You mean my decision.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.960
Your decision, yes.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.720
Are you also
gonna tell your mother

10:41.760 --> 10:43.480
you're refusing
to see a counsellor?

10:44.760 --> 10:47.120
That is full on, Cass?
I've just walked in.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.440
Give me a break.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.000
I need to have some time online.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.040
How about we give Mum a call?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.480
Let me speak to her first, OK?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.680
Eh...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.960
Yes, sweetheart,
but I can understand Cassie.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.640
I mean, the physical pressure
of IVF

11:11.680 --> 11:13.480
let alone the emotional
upheaval...

11:13.520 --> 11:15.040
Sure.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.120
- And now she wants
to draw a line in the sand.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.200
Yeah. I...

11:19.560 --> 11:20.760
Just wanted you to know.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.000
Well, all I can say
is lots of love to you both.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.360
And give Cassie a big hug.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.200
It can't have been
an easy decision.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.640
How's Dad?

11:30.680 --> 11:32.680
- Well, you know your dad,
cracking hardy.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.920
I'll give him a call.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.640
I'll, um, put you onto Rubes.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.760
Hey.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.760
It's Mum.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
Thanks.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.720
Hey, Mum.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.680
Hello, sweetheart.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.600
Ben told me someone made
a gif of you with Dad's words.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.920
Totally lame one.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.840
Yeah,
but it still hurts, right?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.120
A bit.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.600
I can come straight back down
if you need me.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.080
Oh, no.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.640
You be there with Dad.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.200
How about we do one
of our lists?

12:07.920 --> 12:09.360
OK.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.440
Right. Ready?

12:13.480 --> 12:16.680
OK, so we're gonna ignore
what the kids at school said.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.800
Not buy into it.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.040
And how about
you spend the weekend

12:20.080 --> 12:21.720
doing some
of your other interests?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.960
Like swimming practise
or sketching.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.760
Maybe go to the library,
get some new novels?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.360
How's the list looking?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.400
Good.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.640
And let's deprive those creeps
of oxygen.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.480
No going online until
I come back down, alright?

12:35.280 --> 12:37.160
- OK.
- Promise?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.520
Promise.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.680
And how about a nice
get well card for your dad?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.560
He feels so bad
about what he said.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.840
OK.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.760
Oh.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.240
You start.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.920
All I know is I still want us
to have children.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.400
Nothing has changed for me.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.520
You mean, you want
to have your own children.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.160
We need to stay positive.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.000
What?

13:34.320 --> 13:38.840
Every time I felt life inside me
and felt it die...

13:38.880 --> 13:39.960
I know.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.040
Pumping hormones

13:41.080 --> 13:43.400
and clinging
to ever decreasing odds and

13:43.440 --> 13:45.240
I have run out of hope.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.320
Let me hope for both of us.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.880
Just tell me what you need.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.880
To at least discuss adoption.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.320
- Look...
- Just to discuss it.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.320
That's what I need.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.480
Let's just think about this
later down the track.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.280
Ben... You're not listening.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.400
There may be no
later down the track.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.840
What was that dog's name again?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.040
- The one that got run over?
- Wusty.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.640
Wusty.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.080
Maybe we can go together
to see a counsellor.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.040
How is a complete stranger
supposed to help us?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.320
Well, we're not getting anywhere
on our own, Ben.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.920
You've changed your password
and I need the new one.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.040
No you don't.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.600
- No computers, Ruby.
- I'm locked out.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.640
Listen, Ruby.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.040
I have to go online.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.960
Listen, you've already had
a rotten day.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.080
Don't make it any worse.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.800
I have to go online
to do my homework.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.680
And scan this card for Dad.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.160
You'll get in trouble from Mum.
She wants me to.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.520
Ruby.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.760
- Ruby. Ruby, stop.
- Ruby...

15:02.800 --> 15:03.920
- Ruby!
- Stop, stop.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.240
Where you going, sweetie?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.680
I don't know.

15:09.720 --> 15:10.800
Oh, honey.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.880
Look...

15:13.400 --> 15:15.440
I'll take a photo of the card

15:15.480 --> 15:17.080
and we'll get it off
to your dad, OK?

15:17.120 --> 15:18.160
Come back inside.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.480
No one's going online,
not even us.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.640
Fine.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.280
- It's OK.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.000
Ah, good on ya, Rubes.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.320
I sent her a thanks message.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.880
- Hm.
- We're back on track.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.200
Well, you know Ruby,

15:40.240 --> 15:41.640
she gets there in her own time.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.520
Yeah, crisis averted.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.360
Well, bon appetit,
as they say in Wales.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.320
- Lemme just cut that steak...
- No, it's OK.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.880
- Looks wonderful.
- Yeah, but...

15:48.920 --> 15:50.040
I'm fine.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.280
OK.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.840
With wind chills reaching

15:58.880 --> 16:02.000
as low as -76 degrees
Fahrenheit,

16:02.040 --> 16:04.440
Emperors huddle together
to preserve warmth.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.640
Taking turns to move into

16:06.680 --> 16:08.960
the group's
relatively toasty interior.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.320
Then moving back
to the perimeter.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.520
So others can enjoy protection
from the icy elements.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.080
<i>First,</i>
<i>tell the truth to yourself.</i>

16:20.120 --> 16:21.200
OK.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.560
<i>Imagine your</i>
<i>six-year-old self</i>

16:24.600 --> 16:25.840
<i>sitting with you.</i>

16:25.880 --> 16:28.040
<i>And what would they want you</i>
<i>to do right now?</i>

16:28.960 --> 16:30.360
Good morning.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.480
Deep in thought?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.040
Yeah, just the er...

16:35.280 --> 16:36.680
Dusting out the cobwebs.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.360
The six-year-old self exercise.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.360
Indeed.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.680
I, ah,

16:42.720 --> 16:45.280
I hope I didn't overshare
at dinner last night.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.720
It was interesting.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.800
You're interesting.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.920
I just wasn't sure if you...

16:53.640 --> 16:56.320
I'm not sure
how to put this.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.920
What would you say if you did?

17:00.440 --> 17:02.640
You did leave rather suddenly.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.960
You're a very attractive woman.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.240
Very. And I've really
enjoyed your company.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.920
But in case you...

17:11.960 --> 17:15.720
I'm just not looking for anyone
right now, romantically.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.680
My priority
should be Eddie and...

17:19.560 --> 17:21.400
..I'm not ready
to be dating anyone.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.440
Anyone.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.760
And I'm OK with that.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.880
Good for your gorgeous boy.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.160
Hey.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.480
Aw, he really is.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.760
But monastic for you.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.160
It's a choice I've made
without quite realising.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.800
Until now.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.800
Well, even more reason to change
to a job you actually enjoy.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.160
Easier said than done.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.800
Life can be very lonely.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.040
Yeah but you don't deserve
to be lonely.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.920
There'll be someone
out there for you.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.920
Come on. Why wouldn't there be?

18:05.320 --> 18:08.240
Guess I should probably consult
my six-year-old self.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.760
She was a pretty wise cookie.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.200
I bet she was.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.320
Eugh!

18:22.040 --> 18:23.880
Do you know Grandma's password?

18:23.920 --> 18:26.200
Mum's? Of course.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.720
Why don't you just use hers?

18:27.760 --> 18:29.560
Because this isn't her computer.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.480
What do you mean?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.320
She left it here, I saw.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.520
- Keep an eye out for Cassie.
- I will.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.080
That's not fair.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.480
Carbo's here, he's gonna
teach us some magic!

20:34.160 --> 20:36.200
Come on, please.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.080
Do not disturb.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.320
And when you put the coin
in your pocket

20:48.400 --> 20:50.320
you make the audience
look somewhere else.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.640
Will I show Ben and Cassie?

20:54.040 --> 20:55.480
I just want you
to try...

20:55.520 --> 20:57.440
They're busy. Keep practising.

20:57.480 --> 20:58.520
OK.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.760
Why're you making
such a big deal of this?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.480
Fine, Ben. I'll go by myself.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.720
Can't we just enjoy
Carbo being here?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.560
Keep looking me
in the eye.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.800
You don't want to rush it.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.320
Then you divert my attention...

21:09.320 --> 21:11.480
Look, I said I'd go
so I'm going, alright?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.680
- Hello, Carbo.
- Rubes.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.760
Rubes, watch me.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.720
Coin, and what's over there?

21:21.440 --> 21:22.400
Keep practising.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.080
OK.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.440
I'm doing
my best painting ever.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.920
Is that right?

21:31.800 --> 21:34.320
Hey, um, wanna take me
to the art market tomorrow?

21:34.920 --> 21:37.240
An exclusive launch
for Get Carbonated.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.000
Well if it's OK
with Ben and Cassie.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.560
They're going
to a doctor's appointment.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.080
They'll need someone to mind us.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.080
Don't mention the painting.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.080
- I'm saving it for your fans.
- Ah, gotcha.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.240
They'll love it.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.200
Hey, have you ever thought
of doing ventriloquism?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.560
- It's seriously coming back.
- Really?

21:53.640 --> 21:55.280
- Yes.
- Wow.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.920
- Dave?
- Out here.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.800
Do you mind turning out
the kitchen light?

22:10.960 --> 22:13.120
Uh, you can join us if you want.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.040
Hey, mate.
You gotta keep looking up.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.160
International Space Station's
due soon.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.480
Is it?

22:27.240 --> 22:28.400
Hang on a tick.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.240
No point
in making things hard...

22:35.000 --> 22:36.280
..when they can be easy.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.920
Ah, there you go.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.600
The Milky Way.

22:50.640 --> 22:54.000
Yeah well, that's
what your mob call it.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.720
You know what
us blackfellas call it?

22:55.760 --> 22:57.040
No, I should know.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.720
The Great Emu.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.160
But don't look at the stars.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.360
It's the dark spaces
in between them.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.360
Right.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.640
- You see the southern cross?
- Yep.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.040
There's a dark spot
just underneath it.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.160
That's the head.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.360
And then the neck goes
through the two pointers

23:12.400 --> 23:15.160
and the body
goes right across.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.640
And right now the brightest part
is underneath its legs.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.600
When we see it like this

23:20.640 --> 23:23.600
that's when we go
and get the emu eggs.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.760
And some months it's running,

23:25.800 --> 23:27.640
sometimes you can't even
see the legs.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.680
The harder you look
the more you see.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.760
Only if you know
what you're looking for.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.520
Like most things, eh.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.560
It's none of my business,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.440
but if you're pleased
Julie's back,

23:46.040 --> 23:48.000
you should, you should say it.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.360
You know, if she wasn't here
I'd have to manage.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.960
It's just the way it'd be.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.040
Ah, Zen man.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.560
All that for the weekend?

24:16.600 --> 24:18.240
You're a heavy traveller,
Sylvia.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.400
Just my laptop and that's it.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.160
I'm glad
you enjoyed it here, Nathan.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.800
Who could beat
walking on hot coals

24:28.840 --> 24:30.200
and sleeping on a bed of nails?

24:31.640 --> 24:33.240
Well, Jeremy enjoyed
meeting you.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.040
Might be more hot coals
sooner than you think.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.720
So that's his bag

24:42.760 --> 24:43.960
and you two are...

24:44.000 --> 24:47.160
I had a kick in the shin
from a certain six-year-old.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.600
Mr. Right's been here all along.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.600
I've just been so busy
turbo flirting...

24:53.880 --> 24:54.960
It's too much.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.200
Sorry. Again.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.360
Actually, it was something that
I'd been doing myself

25:01.400 --> 25:02.880
and I hadn't realised so...

25:03.760 --> 25:04.880
Thank you.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.800
All for the good.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.520
Congratulations.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.960
- Phone's back on.
- Alright.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.320
One, two, three.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.680
This is
Dave Rafter, leave a message.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.800
Dad, thank you so much
for the stay, it was great.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.760
But I'm gonna have
to head straight back.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.480
The building crisis
has come to a head

25:33.520 --> 25:36.120
so please tell Mum
I will call her later.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.240
OK, Cheers. Bye.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.440
<i>So here goes.</i>

25:42.200 --> 25:43.760
<i>Heading back to face the music.</i>

25:45.280 --> 25:47.960
<i>Let's see if anything I learnt</i>
<i>back there's rubbed off.</i>

25:53.200 --> 25:55.840
About six months
after we were married

25:56.120 --> 25:58.760
All of our focus became
about having children.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.480
Not all of it.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.200
After the first six
months it did.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.400
We both said that
we'd everything we could

26:06.440 --> 26:07.640
to have a baby.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.560
A family of our own.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.160
I always said
I might have problems.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.600
Why did you think that?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.640
Cassie thought it might
be psychological.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.080
Because?

26:23.960 --> 26:25.560
In my family...

26:25.600 --> 26:26.920
You don't have to go there.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.480
I had controlling parents.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.520
Who manipulated me
into a marriage

26:33.560 --> 26:35.160
to a controlling husband.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.240
It was a difficult time.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.080
I had to divorce him

26:39.120 --> 26:41.800
to come down from Queensland
to finish my degree.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.600
My, my first round
of IVF failed with him.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.320
The, erm...

26:49.640 --> 26:52.600
The suffocation, I thought.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.280
That's not how it is with us.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.760
It's what it feels like now.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.640
It's like I'm the subject

26:58.680 --> 27:01.120
of some huge
mathematical problem

27:01.160 --> 27:04.040
that fills a whiteboard
just waiting to be solved.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.600
I'm the obstacle.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.200
I don't think Ben has any idea
how unhappy I am.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.520
OK.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.240
It does seem that Ben's hearing
some of this for the first time.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.520
So let me ask you first, Cassie,

27:29.560 --> 27:33.920
how responsible you feel
for where you both are now?

27:48.520 --> 27:50.120
OK,
let's Get Carbonated.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.360
It's an arty-farty day for us
again here

27:52.400 --> 27:53.600
and we're with Ruby Rafter

27:53.640 --> 27:56.160
ready to unveil her latest opus,

27:56.200 --> 27:59.360
here at the salon
of Mr. Charles Whiteman.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.200
Over to you, Rubes.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.440
I just want you to know

28:05.480 --> 28:06.720
that every one of the words

28:06.760 --> 28:07.960
you'll see on my painting

28:08.000 --> 28:09.040
is what trolls out there

28:09.080 --> 28:10.320
have been saying about me.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.040
But what they don't get

28:12.080 --> 28:15.120
is there are millions of kids
around the world right now

28:15.160 --> 28:16.480
making a difference.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.040
You know who you are.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.680
Demanding the adults in charge
act for change

28:20.720 --> 28:22.640
or step aside for us.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.920
Hope you guys are ready.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.120
And you trolls
should be ashamed.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.480
Crikey!

28:29.520 --> 28:32.120
- OK, we've cut.
- Oh, my dear aunt.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.960
My dear.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.480
All said about me online.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.240
Lots of artists
paint with words.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.120
Christopher Wool comes to mind.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.800
'Sell the house. Sell the car.
Sell the kids.'

28:46.400 --> 28:48.440
Sell the kids
is pretty subversive.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.960
I think you've taken the cake.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.480
Rubes, what have ya done?

28:51.520 --> 28:53.000
Can you check
if we're already viral?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.040
Er...

28:55.880 --> 28:57.760
Oh, sh...

28:59.680 --> 29:01.000
I'm hanging up now.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.880
No comment. No comment.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.040
No comment.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.080
What's going on?

29:05.120 --> 29:08.960
It's just some trashy tabloid
journalist implying that Ruby...

29:09.800 --> 29:11.520
Carbo, put Ruby on the phone.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.560
She's back at Ben
and Cass', Mrs Rafter.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.720
Now you listen to me.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.440
- I didn't know
what the painting was.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.480
On my Yaya's grave.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.160
Well, why didn't you ask
to see it

29:19.200 --> 29:20.960
before you revealed it
to the world?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.360
She wouldn't show it to me.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.600
How old are you, Carbo?

29:23.640 --> 29:24.720
She hoodwinked me.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.840
Grow up!

29:28.360 --> 29:29.600
Hope you guys are ready.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.480
And you trolls
should be ashamed.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.040
- Bloody hell.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.040
Did she paint this?

29:38.080 --> 29:40.040
She was just copying
what the trolls said.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.200
It gets worse and worse.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.000
It was why the journalist
was calling.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.960
'Are we aware of the obscenities
in our daughter's latest work?'

29:46.000 --> 29:47.960
Perish the thought they focus
on the bullying.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
If this has been going on for
days, why didn't you tell me?

29:50.040 --> 29:51.400
Well, you haven't been
very easy to talk to, Dave.

29:51.440 --> 29:52.680
There's a problem with our
daughter

29:52.720 --> 29:53.960
and you keep me outta
the loop?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.560
Yeah, well, I thought I had it
under control.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.600
And Ruby seemed
fine.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.240
I could see something like this
coming a mile off.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.680
Oh, well if you could see it
coming a mile off

29:59.720 --> 30:01.200
why didn't you
do something about it?

30:04.080 --> 30:05.680
Oh, this is bad.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.560
Look, the quickest way
to return to normality

30:10.600 --> 30:12.080
is I bring Ruby back here.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.640
She needs her dad.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.360
She needs stability,
she needs her friends.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.440
You'd be coming too?

30:17.480 --> 30:18.800
Well, obviously.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.920
Well, she should come home
sure, great

30:20.960 --> 30:22.880
but what does that mean
for you and me?

30:22.920 --> 30:24.040
I thought you'd be happy.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.560
You don't have to come home
if you don't want to.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.360
- Ruby needs me, Dave.
- Well, she needed me too

30:28.400 --> 30:29.720
but you took her to the city.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.760
She'd be safe here with me.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.400
You stay there longer
if you have to.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.600
God, you're doing my head in.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.560
Don't you think you've
been doing mine in for weeks?

30:36.600 --> 30:37.800
Think about it.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.920
There's no way
I won't be here for Ruby.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.120
So you either both stay there
or you both come back.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.720
And what does that mean for us?

31:02.720 --> 31:04.640
Tessa. You ready for that walk?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
You know, at first I thought
he was just embarrassed

31:08.640 --> 31:09.880
that he'd had the accident.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.560
Trying to pretend
that he didn't need my help.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.960
But then I started thinking,
is he,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.640
is he trying to drive me away?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.480
I'm sure that's not the case.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.080
No, what it is
is he's testing me.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.040
He doesn't want me at back here
out of duty or pity.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.760
And I'd feel
exactly the same, you know?

31:27.200 --> 31:28.720
He needs me to sort out this...

31:29.400 --> 31:31.000
This gremlin inside.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.240
Not just paper over the cracks.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.480
And we both know
what that might lead to.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.120
Oh Julie, OK.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.600
You're not gonna like this.

31:38.640 --> 31:41.240
But it just makes me so furious.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.320
What?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.000
You're gonna risk all that
love.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.160
You know, that deep love

31:46.200 --> 31:49.760
built on over all these years
that people would kill to have

31:49.800 --> 31:51.440
and you might just
turn your back on.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.080
OK, don't lecture me, Tess.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.080
Well, I'm not just gonna
tell you what you want to hear.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.480
Well, I'm not asking you to.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.880
OK, fine. Well, one night
when you were away

31:59.920 --> 32:01.200
I watched TV with Dave.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.720
Now, we shared a bottle of wine.

32:03.760 --> 32:04.840
Well, good.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.680
You don't even care
that I might've done something.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.880
I know you wouldn't.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.120
Well if Dave had asked, who
knows.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.160
Well, he wouldn't.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.280
Well, thanks very much.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.360
No, you know what I mean.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.760
He wouldn't risk our marriage
like that.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.280
If you are, why wouldn't he?

32:16.320 --> 32:18.040
I mean, he's just a man
he's not a saint.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.400
He's not gonna
stick around forever.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.760
Yeah, OK, that's enough.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.120
Think about it.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.680
<i>You get so wrapped up</i>
<i>with what's wrong in your life</i>

32:51.720 --> 32:55.840
<i>And then, just by slowing down</i>
<i>your thoughts</i>

32:55.880 --> 32:57.840
<i>You remember</i>
<i>what you're grateful for.</i>

33:06.000 --> 33:08.120
My daddy's back!

33:12.200 --> 33:13.480
I learned magic.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.280
I can make money disappear.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.680
Wow.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.040
Oi.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.240
There's going to be something
on the news in a sec.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.960
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>the devastated residents</i>

33:25.000 --> 33:28.400
<i>of Affaron Heights held</i>
<i>a meeting today in the CBD.</i>

33:28.440 --> 33:31.000
<i>Where residents expressed</i>
<i>their frustration</i>

33:31.040 --> 33:32.320
<i>at a lack</i>
<i>of adequate information...</i>

33:32.360 --> 33:33.640
Is it about our building, Dad?

33:35.320 --> 33:36.440
Mm.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.440
There's nothing
to worry about, mate. OK?

33:38.480 --> 33:39.600
OK.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.400
You want to go outside and play
and I'll be right out?

33:41.440 --> 33:42.600
- Alright.
- Alrighty.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.240
Edward, hurry up!

33:44.280 --> 33:45.760
I'm coming, Ruby.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.720
<i>Distressed</i>
<i>residents learnt today</i>

33:48.760 --> 33:50.240
<i>that they're in for a</i>
<i>complicated</i>

33:50.280 --> 33:52.440
<i>and possibly lengthy</i>
<i>legal battle</i>

33:52.480 --> 33:54.080
<i>between the Strata Committee,</i>

33:54.120 --> 33:56.640
<i>the builders</i>
<i>and state government.</i>

33:56.680 --> 33:58.080
<i>No timeline has been set</i>

33:58.120 --> 34:00.240
<i>for residents to return</i>
<i>to their apartments.</i>

34:05.520 --> 34:07.800
Cassie's back.
I better give her a hand.

34:12.720 --> 34:13.840
Here, sweetie.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.520
- Thanks.
- You sure?

34:15.560 --> 34:16.680
Of course.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.760
Nuestra casa es su casa.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.880
Really?

34:21.920 --> 34:23.040
Of course.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.880
Oh, thank you,
thank you both so much.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.080
What does it mean?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.600
It means...

34:28.640 --> 34:30.800
That you keep staying here too.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.640
Yay! Can we? Please, please?

34:32.680 --> 34:33.840
Of course you can.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.760
Yay, yay! Yay, yay,
yay! Everybody's going to stay!

34:36.800 --> 34:40.080
Come on. Homemade banana cake
and ice cream.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.640
Daddy will get the plates.
Come on.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.960
Yay!

34:43.640 --> 34:45.640
- Hey, Cassie?
- Yes, Ruby?

34:45.640 --> 34:47.360
What is your password
by the way?

34:47.400 --> 34:48.600
Sretfar.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.080
S-R-E-T...

34:51.120 --> 34:52.640
Rafters backwards?

34:52.680 --> 34:54.640
Anyone'll guess that in one go.

34:54.640 --> 34:55.960
Hm. You do know
what you just said.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.960
Oh, yeah.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.960
Come.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.600
These were
a big investment.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.080
You seem rather
more worried about the dog poo

35:07.120 --> 35:08.760
than you do about
our little girl.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.160
That online stuff
is child abuse.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.920
There's Ruby, of course.
Goes without saying.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.200
It's bad.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.880
I could give you some

35:19.920 --> 35:21.480
to sell on the sideline.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.760
They're floaters, my friend.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.840
Or gemstones.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.200
Polished turds, at best.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.800
Reindeer poo for Christmas.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.680
You have the optimism
of an artist, Carbo.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.520
Why thank you, Charles.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.800
And the instincts
of a snake oil salesman.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.280
You know that's not
an actual thing, snake oil.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.400
Concern yourself
with Ruby's peace of mind.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.960
And some empathy for Mrs Rafter.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.640
Here you go, champion.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.960
Now remember, one is for Rubes.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.280
- Remember?
- Yes. Yeah? Alright.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.960
Ruby,
come and get your ice cream.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.480
How you feeling
about everything?

35:58.520 --> 35:59.680
I mean, the meeting.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.280
Oh, er,

36:01.320 --> 36:03.480
well, I expected to be gutted

36:04.080 --> 36:05.560
but oddly it's sort of a relief.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.640
How's that?

36:06.640 --> 36:09.600
The legal action's in motion
and for some reason I feel...

36:09.640 --> 36:11.400
...sort of, freed up.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.360
I'm buried in debt.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.160
And sorry for everyone
struggling but...

36:16.160 --> 36:18.320
I dunno, I feel interested
in what's up ahead.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.040
It was all new stuff
at this retreat.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.840
Learning to be
detached from it all.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.200
That's good to hear.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.040
Might be a delayed reaction...

36:27.640 --> 36:28.640
Thanks?

36:30.080 --> 36:32.520
- Hmm, we'll check tomorrow.
- Thanks.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.080
<i>Could be as easy as</i>
<i>getting out of your own way.</i>

36:37.880 --> 36:39.920
<i>Making room</i>
<i>to set things straight.</i>

36:44.160 --> 36:45.800
Would you like to sit down?

36:45.840 --> 36:47.560
Uh, I haven't got long, sorry.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.360
At this retreat...

36:56.200 --> 36:58.560
..thing, I,
I did some thinking.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.920
And?

37:00.960 --> 37:03.480
If I offended you at all
while I was here,

37:03.520 --> 37:04.760
I'm really sorry.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.600
Nathan, you were
a complete jerk that last night.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.280
Justin, on the other hand
was perfectly charming

37:12.320 --> 37:14.920
and did not deserve
what you served out.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.760
I can't tell you
how angry I was.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.920
I've been a pain
since the day I started.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.400
No argument.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.960
That, that wasn't me.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.320
Like, the real me.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.880
It was my id.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.800
There's plenty of other bits
which are, which are pretty OK.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.640
- Such as?
- I'm essentially a good guy.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.800
I just, I wasn't thinking
straight when I started here.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.640
I did see your building
on the news.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.880
Yikes to you.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.520
Yeah, it'll work out.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.360
No one's died, we've got
a roof over our head.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.600
- I like your attitude.
- So we're good?

37:52.520 --> 37:53.640
Friends, kinda?

37:54.880 --> 37:57.360
Reckon that you could
give us a hand for an hour?

37:57.880 --> 37:58.960
Maybe two?

38:00.920 --> 38:03.080
Yeah, I can do that.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
<i>Maybe it was</i>
<i>remembering</i>

38:05.480 --> 38:06.640
<i>to be a Rafter again.</i>

38:08.760 --> 38:10.160
<i>Maybe we all were.</i>

38:10.880 --> 38:12.160
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.640
And, Ben,

38:19.640 --> 38:21.080
what about you?

38:21.120 --> 38:22.560
Anything you'd like to say?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.880
Not really, no.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.160
Anything about what
we've been saying

38:30.200 --> 38:32.000
that you might
find difficult to...

38:33.080 --> 38:34.360
To share with Cassie?

38:37.200 --> 38:40.320
I just wanna give our parents
what they gave us.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.600
Carry on the Rafter tradition.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.640
But each time
Cassie gets pregnant

38:47.160 --> 38:48.360
she miscarries.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.200
Well, obviously I'm gonna
be there for Cassie

38:52.280 --> 38:53.520
to support her.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.120
She's asking how do you feel.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.360
You're upset

38:59.400 --> 39:01.840
So I want to be strong for you.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.200
Ben.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.560
They were your babies too.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.520
I feel sad.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.840
I feel...

39:25.040 --> 39:26.160
... very sad.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.120
I'm afraid of saying
the wrong thing and...

39:40.360 --> 39:41.600
I feel sad.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.520
<i>It's when you stop</i>
<i>forcing your way</i>

39:49.560 --> 39:50.840
<i>around those corners,</i>

39:52.760 --> 39:55.440
<i>corners start turning</i>
<i>by themselves.</i>

39:55.480 --> 39:56.880
Oh, you mean he resigned?

40:00.880 --> 40:04.120
Jeremy, I had no idea
about any of that.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.400
I'd never been
to a retreat before,

40:06.440 --> 40:08.160
I was just sharing some ideas.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.760
Yeah, I will.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.400
Yeah, I, I certainly will.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.320
Thanks.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.160
Mum. You are not going
to believe this.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.800
I've just been offered a job.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.800
- Here.
- Here where?

40:31.840 --> 40:33.880
Managing the wellness retreat.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.960
What happened
to the bloke I met?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.160
Well, he ran off with a guest.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.800
Yeah, he said it was hard
to keep staff.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.640
Well, Nathan mentioned
to the owner

40:41.640 --> 40:44.640
what he liked about the place,
what he might change and...

40:44.680 --> 40:47.520
I mean, it helped
that they know you, obviously.

40:47.560 --> 40:48.640
Local connection.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.360
- So will he take it?
- Well, he sounded keen.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.040
He's even talking about Edward
going to Buradeena Primary.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.680
Ah, better answer it this time.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.480
- Observation Earth?
- I'd say so.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.360
- Hello, darling!

41:04.280 --> 41:05.320
Just a second.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.160
So basically Observation Earth
has dumped me.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.040
I wouldn't put it that way.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.800
But they have.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.880
I just thought you deserved
better than a phone call.

41:20.120 --> 41:23.920
Because you really are
a remarkable girl, Ruby.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.600
Your troll painting, that was...

41:27.200 --> 41:28.520
That was very brave.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.560
It was a tactic.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.800
To show the bullies
they hadn't upset me.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.160
Even though they had.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.080
From now on I'm just
going to ignore them.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.360
That's right.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.120
And to ease up on social media.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.160
You're a natural leader, Ruby.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.120
Just like your sister.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.320
Did Rachel tell you
to come and see me?

41:52.360 --> 41:54.360
Yeah, she did.

41:54.400 --> 41:55.480
Excellent.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.120
Rachel's just so lit.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.440
She is.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.120
And so are you.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.280
So, Justin did the best he could
with the deal but...

42:09.320 --> 42:12.120
...they were always
after more control.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.800
You know, her scheduling,
her clothes.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.400
So she dodged a bullet.
Good.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.760
Well, I don't know
about that but...

42:19.800 --> 42:22.400
I mean, it might've
ironed out her spark.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.840
And how are you,
sweetheart?

42:27.400 --> 42:30.080
I've just missed you all so much
since I've been back.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.280
Aww, yeah.
Well, you look after yourself.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.560
Keep us posted.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.600
Yeah, I will. Oh, um...

42:35.640 --> 42:36.640
I got a call coming through.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.680
OK, I'm going to take that.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.200
Love you guys, bye!

42:39.280 --> 42:40.360
Love you, bye!

42:47.680 --> 42:49.120
I should've kept my mouth shut.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.160
I should've kept Carbo
away from Ruby.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.520
Bugger Observation Earth.
What are we doing, Jules?

43:02.800 --> 43:04.280
Paddo said something to me
the other night

43:04.320 --> 43:06.400
about seeing things
in a different way but...

43:06.440 --> 43:08.280
It doesn't matter what way
I look at it I...

43:09.560 --> 43:10.760
I don't know.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.760
All I know is that
we are tiptoeing around...

43:17.400 --> 43:18.440
a word.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.640
What word?

43:25.200 --> 43:26.400
Divorce.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.120
I know.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.000
And I know
I've got to work this out.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.680
But I'm going to go
back to Sydney,

43:38.760 --> 43:39.760
I'll pack up our stuff

43:39.800 --> 43:41.080
and I'll bring Ruby
back here.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.000
I don't know
what I can promise, Dave.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.280
Except...

43:47.320 --> 43:49.520
..having another run
at finding...

43:50.960 --> 43:52.400
..Julie Rafter here.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.120
<i>Maybe it was time</i>
<i>for everyone to reset.</i>

44:58.800 --> 45:00.440
<i>All of us on the move.</i>

45:01.640 --> 45:03.640
<i>It's the only certainty in life.</i>

45:04.800 --> 45:06.080
<i>There will be change.</i>

45:08.600 --> 45:11.400
<i>Acceptance opens up</i>
<i>possibilities.</i>

45:13.200 --> 45:15.400
<i>Staying on the run</i>
<i>closes them down.</i>

45:18.400 --> 45:21.160
<i>The first step to acceptance</i>
<i>is the hardest one.</i>

45:23.320 --> 45:24.720
<i>Telling the truth.</i>

45:25.600 --> 45:27.000
<i>To yourself.</i>

45:33.360 --> 45:34.360
You've called
Rachel Rafter,

45:34.400 --> 45:35.640
leave a message
and I'll call you back.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.640
Hi, Rach, it's your dad.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.600
I've come to a serious decision
about your mum.
