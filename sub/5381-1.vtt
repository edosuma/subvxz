WEBVTT

03:45.394 --> 03:46.312
Damn it!

04:17.927 --> 04:19.261
Damn it.

05:11.063 --> 05:15.067
I am a goddamn genius.

05:24.577 --> 05:26.328
Oh, my God.

05:33.836 --> 05:36.338
Sebastian, do you have any idea
what time it is?

05:36.672 --> 05:39.592
Da Vinci never slept.
Said it was a waste of time.

05:40.092 --> 05:41.343
Who's that?

05:43.596 --> 05:44.763
Not your business.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.601
<i>Not anymore.</i>

05:50.686 --> 05:51.687
Linda...

05:53.606 --> 05:54.857
<i>...I cracked the reversión.</i>

05:56.525 --> 05:57.610
You cracked it?

05:57.860 --> 05:58.861
<i>Look at this.</i>

06:03.532 --> 06:04.700
<i>Watch.</i>

06:07.786 --> 06:12.875
Eleven months and you suddenly
come up with it out of the blue? How?

06:13.292 --> 06:15.961
The usual. Coffee and Twinkies.

06:16.295 --> 06:17.963
<i>I hate you.</i>

06:18.214 --> 06:22.218
Can you find Matt and get to the lab?
I want Isabelle for a live test.

06:22.801 --> 06:24.220
I think I can find him.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.554
<i>When will you be in?</i>

06:25.804 --> 06:28.224
Well, it should be daylight
in Sweden now.

06:28.474 --> 06:33.562
So I should call the Nobel committee
and tell them to get our prize ready.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.398
<i>I'll see you in a few.</i>

06:43.489 --> 06:44.406
Matt.

06:44.990 --> 06:47.076
Sebastian called.
We gotta get to the lab.

06:47.409 --> 06:49.161
What's the rush?

06:49.495 --> 06:50.496
He cracked reversión.

06:50.829 --> 06:51.997
You're kidding.

06:52.248 --> 06:55.000
When?
- While we were sleeping.

06:56.752 --> 06:58.087
You want a ride?

07:00.172 --> 07:02.174
Maybe we should take our own cars.

07:02.758 --> 07:05.344
I'm tired of this
sneaking around, Lin.

07:05.594 --> 07:07.596
You're gonna have to tell him
eventually.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.349
I will, eventually.

07:10.599 --> 07:12.518
I'm just waiting for the right time.

07:14.770 --> 07:18.274
With Sebastian, there's never
gonna be a right time.

08:04.403 --> 08:05.738
Morning, Dr. Caine.
- Morning.

08:05.988 --> 08:07.990
Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.

08:28.093 --> 08:29.595
Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Ed.

08:29.845 --> 08:32.264
Your team's in early today.
Something special?

08:32.515 --> 08:35.017
Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.

08:41.857 --> 08:45.444
<i>Authorization, please.
- Caine, 0027.</i>

08:45.694 --> 08:46.946
<i>Confirmed.</i>

09:12.930 --> 09:14.265
Hi.

09:22.189 --> 09:23.566
Isabelle.

09:48.090 --> 09:49.258
Come on, Isabelle.

09:50.050 --> 09:51.802
Calm down, baby.

09:55.431 --> 09:56.849
Good girl.

10:07.109 --> 10:08.485
It's okay.

10:10.196 --> 10:11.780
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:13.949 --> 10:15.367
Hold still.

10:42.311 --> 10:43.312
Isabelle?

10:43.479 --> 10:45.481
She's more aggressive these days.

10:45.814 --> 10:49.235
That's what tranquillizers are for.
I'll get her.

10:49.610 --> 10:53.739
She's been gone too long.
It's starting to affect her brain.

10:53.989 --> 10:56.492
You take care of that bite.
- I'll manage.

10:58.244 --> 10:59.495
Hey.

11:01.705 --> 11:03.791
Ten bucks says I nail her first.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.417
You're on.

11:14.093 --> 11:16.303
Isabelle?

11:17.179 --> 11:19.390
Got a surprise for you.

11:37.533 --> 11:38.868
You missed.

11:39.201 --> 11:42.204
Maybe because I don't spend
my lunch hours practicing.

11:45.457 --> 11:46.458
You owe me ten.

11:47.793 --> 11:48.961
Put it on my tab.

11:49.378 --> 11:53.632
You know, someday I may actually
make you pay up.

11:57.803 --> 12:00.472
Sarah's on the warpath,
so you play nice.

12:00.723 --> 12:04.727
This is bullshit, Sebastian.
- And good morning to you too.

12:05.227 --> 12:06.729
Get the monkey on the table.

12:07.062 --> 12:11.400
How can you justify injecting Isabelle
with the serum without even testing it?

12:11.734 --> 12:12.985
Because it'll save time.

12:13.235 --> 12:14.904
Then you can mop up afterwards.

12:15.154 --> 12:17.406
You think I'm trying to kill Isabelle?

12:17.656 --> 12:20.743
Kill? More like liquefy.
- Lab's prepped.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.080
Well, your objections are duly noted
and summarily overruled.

12:25.331 --> 12:26.749
Yes, sir.

12:28.584 --> 12:32.087
How come when you say, 'Yes, sir,'
it sounds like 'Fuck you'?

12:32.755 --> 12:33.756
Practice.

12:34.757 --> 12:36.926
How'd you convince me to hire her?

12:37.259 --> 12:39.094
You wanted the best vet in the U.S.

12:39.345 --> 12:43.682
She cares more about the animals.
- And maybe that's why she's so good.

12:45.017 --> 12:47.353
So this guy you're seeing,
what's he like?

12:47.603 --> 12:49.438
He's everything you're not.

12:50.689 --> 12:52.107
He must be dull.

13:12.378 --> 13:14.630
Ready in 40.
- Okay.

13:16.048 --> 13:17.383
Vitals?

13:17.633 --> 13:18.634
All normal.

13:18.801 --> 13:21.220
Using the word 'normal' loosely,
of course.

13:21.470 --> 13:24.557
Emergency medical, standing by.
- Tech, status?

13:24.807 --> 13:26.141
<i>This is God.</i>

13:26.392 --> 13:28.894
<i>You are disturbing the natural
order of things...</i>

13:29.144 --> 13:32.314
<i>...and will be severely punished
for all eternity.</i>

13:32.648 --> 13:34.233
God has spoken.

13:34.817 --> 13:36.902
How many times must
I tell you, Frank...

13:37.486 --> 13:38.988
...you're not God.

13:39.738 --> 13:40.823
I am.

13:42.491 --> 13:44.159
Sorry, chief. Forgot.

13:44.743 --> 13:46.078
You guys ready to roll yet?

13:46.412 --> 13:47.413
Yes.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.750
Like those sorry-ass M.D. S
have ever had to wait for us.

13:52.168 --> 13:54.837
Tell His Highness
Mary was hot two hours ago.

13:55.171 --> 13:56.839
Yeah, I'll tell him that.

13:57.256 --> 13:59.425
Ready up here, chief.
- Roll and record.

13:59.592 --> 14:00.593
Rolling.

14:01.594 --> 14:05.848
<i>Subject, Isabelle Two.
Currently in phase-shift, 126 hours.</i>

14:10.269 --> 14:12.021
Testing D-phase protocol...

14:12.354 --> 14:15.941
...Serial Irradiated Protein Caine 125.

14:16.192 --> 14:19.361
Stop naming them after yourself,
you'd have better luck.

14:19.612 --> 14:22.531
Thank you, Dr. Kensington,
for that keen observation.

14:22.781 --> 14:24.283
I'll include it in my memoirs.

14:24.617 --> 14:27.036
I'll make sure to put you in mine.

14:27.286 --> 14:30.206
Would you guys be serious, please?

14:31.123 --> 14:34.293
You think she'll make it?
- I don't know, I just work here.

14:34.627 --> 14:36.712
Quantum signatures are calibrated.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.049
Okay, Sarah, get us a vein.

14:46.222 --> 14:47.306
Spray.

14:53.896 --> 14:54.897
Vein's prepped.

14:56.482 --> 14:57.816
All right.

14:59.568 --> 15:01.070
Here goes nothing.

15:01.487 --> 15:03.989
Bad form, Matthew.
The honor is mine.

15:08.911 --> 15:10.162
Okay.

15:22.842 --> 15:26.762
Injection occurred at 0847.

15:41.777 --> 15:43.445
Elevated heartbeat.

15:47.032 --> 15:49.034
We're still in the green.
- Confirmed.

15:49.702 --> 15:53.122
Bioelectric energy and quantum
shift indicators are stable.

15:58.294 --> 15:59.795
We're getting cellular reaction.

16:12.892 --> 16:14.977
It's working. It's actually working.

16:15.728 --> 16:17.730
Of course it is.
- Don't get cocky.

16:22.735 --> 16:25.070
Heart rate's up. She's scared.
It's okay.

16:25.404 --> 16:29.825
Subject began manifesting
immediately. Protocol's acting quickly.

16:32.995 --> 16:35.831
Goddamn it, blood pressure crashing.
Pulse high.

16:42.087 --> 16:43.255
It's her heart.

16:46.258 --> 16:48.928
<i>I got erratic heartbeat
and brain activity.</i>

16:49.261 --> 16:51.847
She's going into cardiac arrest.
- Defib!

16:52.181 --> 16:53.849
Prep an intracardiac.

16:59.355 --> 17:02.358
Flatline. We're losing her.
- No, we're not. Hit her!

17:02.691 --> 17:03.859
Clear!

17:06.111 --> 17:07.613
Again.
- Clear.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.117
Again!
- Clear.

17:13.618 --> 17:14.537
Come on.
- Again!

17:14.787 --> 17:15.954
Clear!

17:17.289 --> 17:18.624
Fuck! Intracardiac.

17:20.209 --> 17:21.794
Wait! No, we got something.

17:27.550 --> 17:29.385
Still erratic...

17:29.718 --> 17:31.470
...and stabilizing.

18:14.763 --> 18:16.307
Oh, man.

18:16.807 --> 18:21.270
Brain activity returning to normal.
Quantum signatures are stable.

18:24.023 --> 18:25.858
Welcome back, Isabelle.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.030
Yeah. Yeah!

18:31.280 --> 18:33.115
Yeah, baby!

18:34.033 --> 18:35.868
We did it.
- Good work, everyone.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.204
Yeah! That's the way it's done, man.

18:38.454 --> 18:40.664
So how's she doing, doc?

18:42.708 --> 18:45.044
Well, I think she's gonna be okay.

18:49.715 --> 18:53.427
Come on. Right in there.
- Come on, Isabelle.

18:53.719 --> 18:56.138
Go ahead. Good girl.

18:58.390 --> 18:59.892
Look how peaceful she is.

19:00.142 --> 19:02.186
It seems like nothing happened to her.

19:02.436 --> 19:06.649
Schedule a vivisection for Monday.
I wanna check her neuropathways.

19:06.982 --> 19:09.818
You just brought her back
and you're gonna slice up her brain?

19:10.069 --> 19:11.904
I'm not running a goddamn zoo!

19:12.488 --> 19:15.866
You're a fucking unethical bastard.
- Tell her you're kidding.

19:16.116 --> 19:18.244
Right?
- Right.

19:18.494 --> 19:20.329
I won't cut her for another week.

19:21.455 --> 19:23.082
Don't be such an asshole.

19:23.415 --> 19:25.668
We finally have something
to celebrate.

19:25.918 --> 19:28.254
Cool. I'm hungry, let's go.
- Me too.

19:29.755 --> 19:31.507
We should cut you up.

19:33.425 --> 19:36.762
Ladies and gentlemen,
a moment of your time, please.

19:37.012 --> 19:38.013
Here it comes.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.267
To the finest research team
I have ever known.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.518
Cheers.

19:42.768 --> 19:44.144
Cheers.

19:50.401 --> 19:53.529
There was a big explosión,
and afterward she said:

19:53.779 --> 19:58.117
'If you're so smart, how come
you're still in the second grade?'

19:58.450 --> 20:01.120
She grew her eyebrows back?
- In a month.

20:01.370 --> 20:03.539
How long were you suspended?
- A month.

20:19.555 --> 20:23.267
Hey, I thought you'd gone.

20:23.559 --> 20:25.227
There's nowhere to go.

20:27.938 --> 20:29.732
Did I miss something?

20:30.149 --> 20:32.401
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

20:32.776 --> 20:37.323
Reversión was the last breakthrough.
Feels like the beginning of the end.

20:37.656 --> 20:40.576
That's not true.
We've got a lifetime of data.

20:40.910 --> 20:44.997
Matt has the patience to crunch
the numbers, but you know me...

20:45.289 --> 20:48.918
...I need this grandeur
and the spectacle.

20:49.168 --> 20:51.837
I can't concern myself
with the details.

20:52.505 --> 20:55.299
Yeah, I know. I was one of them.

20:59.178 --> 21:02.014
I thought we were great together.

21:03.933 --> 21:04.934
You were great.

21:05.726 --> 21:08.270
I was just standing next to you.

21:09.522 --> 21:13.567
Come on. We had some good times.

21:13.943 --> 21:15.778
Yeah, we had some good times.

21:19.406 --> 21:22.034
Have you ever wanted to
turn the clock back?

21:23.536 --> 21:25.162
Go back and try again?

21:26.539 --> 21:30.376
L'd say that kind of time travel
doesn't exist.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.463
Well, maybe we should invent it.

21:52.022 --> 21:53.232
Or not.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.024
What's it like?

22:46.952 --> 22:49.455
Four years ago, this committee
gave me...

22:49.788 --> 22:51.707
...a very specific
and challenging task...

22:51.957 --> 22:54.627
...to phase-shift a human being
out of quantum sync...

22:54.877 --> 22:56.795
...with the visible universe...

22:57.046 --> 22:59.298
...and return him safely
with no aftereffects.

22:59.882 --> 23:03.302
We found that sending them
to never-never land was easy.

23:04.136 --> 23:06.388
It's the getting them back
that's hard.

23:18.734 --> 23:20.903
Primary DNA strands
decaying on you?

23:21.153 --> 23:23.239
Along with cellular bond instability.

23:23.656 --> 23:25.407
How have you solved the problem?

23:26.826 --> 23:27.827
I haven't.

23:29.578 --> 23:32.581
But we're close.

23:35.334 --> 23:37.336
We just need more time.

23:49.181 --> 23:52.184
Ever since you walked in my class
your freshman year...

23:52.434 --> 23:54.103
...I knew you were different.

23:54.436 --> 23:57.439
Over the years, your genius
has been most impressive.

23:58.107 --> 23:59.275
Thank you, Dr. Kramer.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.026
Well, don't thank me yet.

24:02.444 --> 24:05.281
This committee has given you
remarkable leeway.

24:05.531 --> 24:10.119
We've tolerated your eccentricities,
as well as your need for privacy.

24:10.369 --> 24:14.623
And I assure you,
our patience is running out.

24:14.874 --> 24:17.209
If we don't get results
and get them soon...

24:17.710 --> 24:20.379
...your genius will cease
to impress me.

24:20.963 --> 24:22.798
And if you can't make it work...

24:23.132 --> 24:26.468
...I'll find another
Sebastian Caine who can.

24:27.052 --> 24:29.972
What just happened in there?
- This better be good.

24:30.222 --> 24:33.058
I wasn't ready for them to know.
- You weren't ready?

24:33.309 --> 24:36.061
Being ready's not it.
You have results, you report them.

24:36.312 --> 24:38.981
Can I explain?
- You just lied to the Pentagon!

24:39.231 --> 24:41.233
Once they know we've completed it...

24:41.483 --> 24:44.153
...what's to stop them from
taking over the project?

24:44.403 --> 24:47.072
Why would they?
- Because they won't need us.

24:47.323 --> 24:50.075
But it's their project.
It's gonna happen sometime.

24:50.326 --> 24:53.245
It may be their project,
but it's my dream, my visión.

24:53.496 --> 24:56.999
What are you proposing?
- That we go to Phase Three ourselves.

24:57.333 --> 24:58.918
Phase Three? Are you nuts?

24:59.168 --> 25:02.505
You can't jump into human testing.
There's rules, procedures.

25:03.255 --> 25:07.676
You don't make history with rules.
You make it by seizing the moment.

25:09.512 --> 25:12.598
You wanna be the first one.
That's what this is about.

25:13.265 --> 25:17.603
This is not about me, it's about us.
We said we would change the worid.

25:19.688 --> 25:21.440
Now is our chance.

25:29.782 --> 25:31.617
And we'll get the Nobel Prize.

25:37.456 --> 25:38.457
Come on, buddy.

25:45.047 --> 25:49.301
You know, if somebody finds out that
we bypassed advisory review...

25:49.552 --> 25:53.889
...we're never gonna work again.
- But if it works, no one'll care.

26:00.145 --> 26:02.398
How did you get clearance
for Phase Three?

26:02.731 --> 26:05.401
I volunteered. They approved.
- No way.

26:05.734 --> 26:07.152
You're kidding.

26:08.988 --> 26:11.657
You volunteered? Are you insane?

26:13.742 --> 26:17.830
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine
on himself. Was he insane?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.999
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.

26:20.749 --> 26:22.084
Shit.

26:22.918 --> 26:27.339
In the past four weeks, we have
brought back seven primates.

26:27.590 --> 26:31.343
The results speak for themselves.
- Or do you wanna believe that?

26:31.594 --> 26:36.265
Sarah, I thought you'd be happy.
We are giving the animals a break.

26:40.186 --> 26:44.190
Moving this fast is bad science,
no matter who the guinea pig is.

26:44.440 --> 26:48.861
I can't believe they approved this.
- I think it's fucking cool.

26:49.278 --> 26:50.279
You would.

26:50.613 --> 26:53.532
If we're to move forward,
this is the next logical step.

26:55.784 --> 27:00.623
I'll stay shifted for three days and then
we'll perform a quantum reversión.

27:00.873 --> 27:01.790
Fuck, yes.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.959
Can I count on your best work?

27:09.131 --> 27:10.132
Good.

27:18.557 --> 27:20.726
How did we let him talk us into this?

27:22.311 --> 27:24.146
Can we talk about it later?

27:24.396 --> 27:26.398
I'm trying to make love to you.

27:26.982 --> 27:29.318
We're risking our professional
lives here.

27:31.654 --> 27:33.239
Yes, Matt, I realize.

27:33.489 --> 27:34.990
Then why did we agree to it?

27:35.324 --> 27:37.326
Because we're suckers.

27:38.244 --> 27:41.497
And because sometimes
when you get to the edge of the map...

27:41.747 --> 27:45.668
...you have to keep sailing
to see what's out there.

27:49.505 --> 27:53.175
And maybe because we both know
that Sebastian can pull it off.

27:56.762 --> 28:00.850
Let me ask another question.
- Is it about who's gonna be on top?

28:05.771 --> 28:07.106
Ever miss being with him?

28:10.359 --> 28:14.446
Why do you ask that?
- Because he sets the bar pretty high.

28:16.615 --> 28:18.534
Let me tell you a little secret.

28:20.035 --> 28:24.290
The concept of Sebastian
is much more appealing...

28:24.540 --> 28:26.542
...than Sebastian himself.

28:29.044 --> 28:31.463
Whereas you...

28:32.047 --> 28:35.050
You're methodical...

28:35.885 --> 28:37.887
...precise...

28:40.055 --> 28:43.142
...and very, very thorough.

28:45.060 --> 28:46.979
And besides...

28:48.397 --> 28:50.399
...you fit better.

28:54.069 --> 28:55.654
We're ready for you.

28:59.992 --> 29:01.410
See you later.

29:04.079 --> 29:07.833
It's not too late to stop.
- I thought I was the nervous one.

29:08.083 --> 29:09.668
We have a lot riding on this.

29:09.919 --> 29:12.087
Hear about Superman
and Wonder Woman?

29:12.338 --> 29:14.423
Stop clowning around.
- It's a good one.

29:14.673 --> 29:16.759
Superman is flying over Metropolis.

29:17.092 --> 29:19.261
He's horny and checking out
the rooftops.

29:19.512 --> 29:23.933
He sees Wonder Woman sunning
on the roof of the Justice League.

29:24.183 --> 29:28.771
She's lying there buck-naked, spread-
eagle, wanting to be fucked, right?

29:29.104 --> 29:30.523
Superman says to himself:

29:30.856 --> 29:33.108
'I gotta get myself
some Wonder pussy. '

29:33.359 --> 29:37.196
Then he realizes that he could
fly down, do a little fast pumping...

29:37.446 --> 29:40.366
...and be gone before she knew,
since he's Superman.

29:40.616 --> 29:42.535
Faster than a speeding bullet.

29:42.868 --> 29:46.455
He swoops down, he fucks her
so quick, she doesn't even see him.

29:46.705 --> 29:51.210
Wonder Woman sits up, says,
'What the fuck was that?'

29:51.627 --> 29:54.129
And the Invisible Man says,
'I don't know...

29:54.463 --> 29:57.383
...but my asshole is killing me. '

29:59.134 --> 30:02.471
That's funny, right?
Come on, guys. That's funny.

30:19.655 --> 30:23.075
Ladies, please. This is science.

30:29.248 --> 30:30.833
Starting IV drip.

30:35.254 --> 30:38.424
Okay, how are you feeling?
- I'm a little tense.

30:38.674 --> 30:42.094
Pulse 88. BP 140l95.
It's a bit elevated.

30:42.344 --> 30:43.929
I wonder why.

30:45.014 --> 30:46.015
Are you sure?

30:46.682 --> 30:48.017
Positive.

30:49.351 --> 30:51.187
We ready up in heaven?
- Ready.

30:53.189 --> 30:54.106
Mary's rolling.

30:54.356 --> 30:57.443
I just hope we're not making
a snuff film. Rolling.

30:58.027 --> 31:00.112
If it is, I got dibs on his Porsche.

31:00.446 --> 31:02.531
Janice, how can you say that?

31:02.948 --> 31:03.949
Sorry.

31:04.533 --> 31:06.118
Porsche is mine.

31:06.785 --> 31:10.122
Subject male, age 38,
weight 166 pounds.

31:14.293 --> 31:16.045
Serum's irradiated.

31:17.379 --> 31:18.797
This better work.
- It will.

31:19.048 --> 31:21.467
Oh, yeah?
- You wanna bet on it?

31:21.717 --> 31:24.220
If I win, you won't be around
to pay off, so, no.

31:24.553 --> 31:25.554
Are you ready?

31:26.222 --> 31:29.558
I'll do it. So if anything
goes wrong, you can't be blamed.

31:32.311 --> 31:33.312
All right.

31:37.233 --> 31:38.484
Any last words?

31:39.735 --> 31:42.905
Yeah. If I die, pretend I said
something deep and clever.

32:11.517 --> 32:13.936
Injection administered at 1823.

32:16.188 --> 32:19.441
Are you feeling anything?
- Nothing so far.

32:22.945 --> 32:25.197
Vitals are stable.
- Nothing's happening.

32:25.447 --> 32:27.950
Human DNA structure
may take more time.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.785
You pulsed it right?
- Yes.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.621
Recheck the radiation.
It can't be non-reactive.

32:32.872 --> 32:35.374
No change in bioelectric activity.

32:35.875 --> 32:36.792
Goddamn it!

32:37.459 --> 32:40.546
I'll repeat the protocol, okay?
- Wait.

32:42.798 --> 32:45.301
I'm starting to feel something.

32:46.969 --> 32:48.971
It's my arm. It's...

32:49.305 --> 32:51.056
It's getting warm.

32:52.808 --> 32:55.895
Okay, it's starting to tingle.

32:58.063 --> 33:01.400
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.

33:07.990 --> 33:08.991
Here we go.

33:18.417 --> 33:20.836
Shit! It hurts.

33:21.921 --> 33:23.339
It's tearing me.

33:24.006 --> 33:27.426
Heartbeat's elevated.
Pulse at 110. 130.

33:34.016 --> 33:36.769
Christ, didn't think it
would hurt so much.

33:37.269 --> 33:38.270
Frank, readouts!

33:38.521 --> 33:41.607
Brain waves are spiking.
He's on the verge of a seizure.

33:45.528 --> 33:48.781
Pulse is 165, 170.
Blood pressure 180 over 110.

33:49.031 --> 33:52.535
Sebastian, can you hear me?
Sebastian?

33:57.289 --> 33:59.458
His heart'll blow out!
- Standby paddles!

33:59.792 --> 34:01.043
Coming in.

34:06.799 --> 34:08.967
Subcellular quantum. He's shifting.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.219
Bioelectric in the red.

34:12.471 --> 34:13.556
Wait.

34:13.973 --> 34:15.391
He's going.

34:19.812 --> 34:20.980
Pulse is 180.

34:21.230 --> 34:22.982
Holding stable.

34:40.081 --> 34:42.333
Holy shit.

34:47.922 --> 34:52.094
Pulse is dropping. 170, 160, 150.

35:12.031 --> 35:15.868
<i>Bio-quantum phase-shift
occurred at 1826.</i>

35:17.453 --> 35:18.454
Is he okay?

35:18.704 --> 35:22.124
Yeah, he's in bioelectric shock.
Passed out from the trauma.

35:22.374 --> 35:23.709
Vitals returning to normal?

35:23.959 --> 35:26.629
Pulse 110, dropping.
Blood pressure's 130l75.

35:26.962 --> 35:30.049
Quantum readings normal.
- Electrical activity is stabilizing.

35:35.429 --> 35:37.723
Something to tell the grandkids.

35:39.850 --> 35:42.144
Pulse steady at 85.

35:43.812 --> 35:47.399
You did it. You're the first.

36:23.519 --> 36:25.020
It's okay. It's okay.

36:25.771 --> 36:27.439
You nodded off.

36:28.941 --> 36:31.735
His breathing's hypnotic.
- Yeah.

36:32.862 --> 36:34.530
How long has it been?

36:35.364 --> 36:36.532
Seventeen hours.

36:37.032 --> 36:40.703
And we already have enough data
for two lifetimes of research.

36:41.203 --> 36:42.663
It's a brave new worid, Lin.

36:46.292 --> 36:50.379
I keep looking at that hole,
wondering if he's really there.

36:51.213 --> 36:54.216
Did you see that?
- Sebastian, can you hear me?

36:54.675 --> 36:58.470
Christ! The lights!
Turn off the goddamn lights!

37:02.224 --> 37:03.642
I can't close my eyes.

37:03.893 --> 37:06.395
You can, but your eyelids
are transparent.

37:06.645 --> 37:11.108
It's weird. I feel the same,
but I'm not here.

37:11.901 --> 37:13.444
You're here.

37:23.329 --> 37:25.498
Sebastian?
- I'm right here.

37:25.748 --> 37:27.791
Where?
- At the mirror.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.252
Looking at myself.

37:33.339 --> 37:36.258
Or, rather, not looking at myself.

37:40.346 --> 37:42.389
Hey, how's he doing?

37:42.640 --> 37:44.517
Why don't you ask Sebastian?

37:45.434 --> 37:48.771
How do you feel?
- Oh, not too bad, considering.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.195
Just wanna set the mood.

37:56.529 --> 37:59.824
It's the light.
His eyelids are transparent.

38:01.116 --> 38:03.118
So, what's it like being a ghost?

38:03.369 --> 38:06.539
Ghosts are dead. I'm very much alive.

38:06.789 --> 38:08.123
Come on, don't be a dick.

38:08.374 --> 38:10.376
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

38:10.543 --> 38:14.046
Okay, now I feel like
we're playing Marco Polo.

38:15.297 --> 38:17.383
I wonder where he is now.

38:17.633 --> 38:21.220
Well, I see the procedure's
not changed your personality.

38:21.804 --> 38:25.224
He just brushed by me.
- No worries, I'm on it.

38:28.394 --> 38:30.354
Do you see anything?
- Where is he?

38:30.646 --> 38:32.064
You got him?

38:33.065 --> 38:35.025
Sebastian?

38:35.234 --> 38:36.652
Got you, chief.

38:38.070 --> 38:40.322
You guys have no sense of fun.

38:40.990 --> 38:42.575
Shit. Oh, my God.

38:42.741 --> 38:46.912
L've arranged for one of us to be
here 24l7, if you need anything.

38:47.163 --> 38:51.167
The team's gonna be on alpha-call
alert, so we can be here within...

38:51.458 --> 38:55.379
Thirty minutes. I know.
I wrote the procedure, remember?

38:56.130 --> 38:59.675
I was reassuring you. There's
a thermal camera for observation.

38:59.925 --> 39:02.136
She likes this, doesn't she?
- What?

39:02.428 --> 39:04.930
Being in charge.
- Oh, yeah. She loves it.

39:05.347 --> 39:07.766
It's about time the shoe
was on the other foot.

39:08.934 --> 39:10.019
Well, just remember.

39:11.353 --> 39:13.439
It's still my project.

39:22.490 --> 39:26.535
You okay taking the late shift?
- It's not like I have a social life.

39:26.785 --> 39:29.622
I know. The workaholic's curse.

39:29.872 --> 39:32.541
Carter's gonna be in by 6
to spell you.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.960
I'm here at 8.
Call me if you need to.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.046
I'll be fine. Get some sleep.

39:37.296 --> 39:39.048
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

40:42.444 --> 40:44.029
Sarah?

40:45.030 --> 40:46.031
Are you awake?

41:34.497 --> 41:36.081
Sebastian?

41:41.587 --> 41:43.255
Are you in here?

41:53.516 --> 41:55.184
I know you're in here.

42:02.858 --> 42:06.111
Then when I checked the monitor
again, he's back in the bed.

42:06.278 --> 42:09.198
When I ask him where he'd been,
he said he's getting coffee.

42:09.365 --> 42:12.952
Why didn't you call me?
- Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.

42:13.118 --> 42:18.040
I mean, I could have been dreaming.
I just thought I should tell someone.

42:18.207 --> 42:19.792
What do you wanna do?

42:20.000 --> 42:23.128
I don't know. I have a tough time
believing he'd be that crude.

42:23.712 --> 42:25.297
I feel so stupid.

42:25.548 --> 42:27.716
Why don't I talk to him?
I'll see what he says...

42:27.967 --> 42:28.968
No, don't.

42:29.134 --> 42:32.388
You know, it's probably nothing.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

42:35.474 --> 42:38.060
So how was your first night?
- Restless.

42:38.310 --> 42:40.604
Hard to sleep without
closing your eyes.

42:40.855 --> 42:41.814
What'd you do?

42:42.064 --> 42:45.067
Got up a couple of times.
Walked around.

42:45.317 --> 42:47.486
Sarah mentioned you weren't
in your room.

42:47.820 --> 42:49.238
I got a cup of coffee.

42:49.488 --> 42:53.117
In the future, you'll wanna tell
the on-call where you're going...

42:53.367 --> 42:55.452
...just in case something
happens to you.

42:55.744 --> 42:58.747
I'm touched by your concern,
but it's not a problem.

42:58.998 --> 43:00.916
We don't want it to become one.

43:02.585 --> 43:04.044
Everything's normal.

43:05.754 --> 43:07.590
All right, let's get these off.

43:11.177 --> 43:12.386
You okay?

43:13.012 --> 43:13.971
Yeah. Why?

43:14.597 --> 43:16.432
You seem a little nervous.

43:18.601 --> 43:20.728
No, I'm fine.

43:25.024 --> 43:26.692
Are you looking at me?

43:27.776 --> 43:28.861
No.

43:29.945 --> 43:30.946
Why?

43:33.866 --> 43:34.825
No reason.

43:44.460 --> 43:47.963
What was the clientele like?
- This guy comes up to me and says:

43:48.214 --> 43:51.884
'I like my women like my coffee. '
People still use that line?

43:52.134 --> 43:54.970
Maybe he meant cold and bitter.
- Very funny.

43:55.304 --> 43:57.973
I gotta take a leak.
Keep Carter away from my food.

43:58.224 --> 44:01.060
I'll try, but I can't promise.
- All right.

44:41.016 --> 44:43.102
It'd be freaky, but it'd settle down.

44:43.352 --> 44:46.939
No, what would you do if you knew
you couldn't be seen?

44:47.189 --> 44:51.694
It gives me the creeps. I can't take
a piss without wearing my thermals.

44:51.986 --> 44:54.822
Like anyone wants to see that.
- How do I know?

44:55.197 --> 44:58.117
Are you asking what we'd do
or what Sebastian would do?

44:58.367 --> 44:59.285
The difference?

44:59.618 --> 45:02.037
There's human nature,
then there's Sebastian.

45:02.371 --> 45:04.290
He's always joking that he's God.

45:04.623 --> 45:07.334
Imagine what he'd do if
left to his own devices.

45:07.626 --> 45:08.711
Scary thought.

45:08.961 --> 45:11.255
Thankfully, it's almost over.
- Hallelujah.

45:11.505 --> 45:14.633
It's just beginning.
You think Sebastian's bad?

45:14.925 --> 45:17.761
Lmagine if the military
gets their hands on this.

45:18.053 --> 45:20.723
Better our military than
someone else's.

46:07.436 --> 46:09.355
Sebastian, goddamn it.

46:09.939 --> 46:14.193
You have no idea how much fun
this is. You should try it.

46:14.693 --> 46:16.779
I'm sure I'll have my chance.

46:22.284 --> 46:24.286
Hey, relax.

46:24.620 --> 46:28.040
It's my last night, so I thought
we'd try one more experiment.

46:28.207 --> 46:30.376
Sebastian.

46:30.876 --> 46:35.297
Can you guess what this is?

46:35.714 --> 46:36.882
What?

46:42.221 --> 46:43.889
How did it feel?

46:45.391 --> 46:47.226
A little too familiar.

46:53.399 --> 46:56.819
Wanna know what it's like
to make love to an invisible man?

46:57.903 --> 47:00.573
It'd just be like old times.
- What do you mean?

47:00.823 --> 47:02.408
You were never there.

47:02.992 --> 47:04.910
Well, I'm here now.

47:06.078 --> 47:08.164
We talked about this once, remember?

47:08.581 --> 47:09.665
What?

47:09.999 --> 47:12.334
You wondered if you'd know
the difference.

47:13.419 --> 47:16.172
Sebastian, I do know the difference.

47:16.672 --> 47:20.426
It's not what I don't see.
It's what I don't feel.

47:22.344 --> 47:23.762
Get some rest.

47:24.180 --> 47:25.764
Got a big day tomorrow.

47:33.522 --> 47:35.274
Subject: Dr. Sebastian Caine.

47:35.608 --> 47:39.695
Currently in phase-shift
86 hours, 23 minutes.

47:40.029 --> 47:43.949
D- phase protocol. Injecting
Serial Protein Caine 127.

47:44.283 --> 47:46.202
Irradiation complete.

47:46.619 --> 47:47.620
Set.

47:48.537 --> 47:51.207
Are you ready?
- Not really.

47:53.125 --> 47:54.960
I was starting to enjoy myself.

47:56.128 --> 47:57.880
Well, tough.

47:59.381 --> 48:01.467
We'll see you in a minute, my friend.

48:03.469 --> 48:06.472
Injection occurred at 0928.

48:17.983 --> 48:19.318
What are you feeling?

48:19.985 --> 48:22.238
Something's not right.

48:29.495 --> 48:30.996
Heartbeat elevated. Frank.

48:31.330 --> 48:32.748
Shift indicators are erratic.

48:32.998 --> 48:36.335
Bioelectric's jumping.
- Check radiation. Crash cart.

48:38.420 --> 48:39.588
What?

48:39.922 --> 48:41.423
What's happening?

48:41.674 --> 48:43.843
I can't breathe.

48:44.093 --> 48:46.929
Check his airway.
- His lungs are seized. Intubate.

48:50.683 --> 48:51.851
Carter!

48:56.188 --> 48:57.356
Tube him!

49:07.366 --> 49:09.034
Sebastian.

49:17.209 --> 49:20.129
He's going into phase-shift.
- Get him on the table.

49:21.046 --> 49:21.964
We lost our signals.

49:22.882 --> 49:24.967
Goddamn!

49:25.885 --> 49:28.387
Get me an IV of AG-7.
- I'm on it.

49:33.392 --> 49:34.310
No pulse.

49:35.144 --> 49:36.729
L've got no pulse!

49:36.979 --> 49:38.481
Starting CPR.

49:45.488 --> 49:46.655
Don't you die on me.

49:46.906 --> 49:50.409
Don't you fucking die on me.
- I'm getting a pulse.

49:54.580 --> 49:57.583
Sebastian, can you hear me?
- He's going into shock.

50:04.089 --> 50:05.591
Jesus.

50:10.095 --> 50:11.847
Hi.

50:12.348 --> 50:14.266
So I guess it didn't work.

50:14.517 --> 50:15.768
No.

50:16.769 --> 50:19.855
You look worried. Must've been bad.

50:22.525 --> 50:23.776
You almost died.

50:24.276 --> 50:26.445
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.

50:26.779 --> 50:31.617
Yeah, and ends our careers.
What are we gonna tell Kramer?

50:32.618 --> 50:34.036
Nothing.

50:34.537 --> 50:36.372
He doesn't need to know yet.

50:37.456 --> 50:41.210
We can't keep lying to the others.
- We don't have a choice.

50:41.544 --> 50:44.129
If I'm gonna be stuck
like this for a while...

50:44.380 --> 50:46.465
...we'll have to make
a few adjustments.

50:51.637 --> 50:52.638
Done.

50:56.475 --> 50:57.393
Open.
- Here.

51:22.835 --> 51:23.836
Okay, lift.

51:25.504 --> 51:26.922
Carter, get the fan.

51:41.353 --> 51:43.022
Okay, don't move.

51:55.534 --> 51:56.452
Don't move.

52:02.291 --> 52:03.959
Thanks. That's better.

52:07.046 --> 52:08.214
Here you go.

52:09.548 --> 52:12.468
It's an improvement.
- You'd almost pass for human.

52:12.718 --> 52:15.971
He couldn't before.
- You have a face you can talk to now.

52:16.305 --> 52:18.807
We can all work in normal light again.

52:19.975 --> 52:23.145
Let's see if we can't try
to figure out what went wrong.

52:23.395 --> 52:25.731
Before he starts biting people too.

52:32.071 --> 52:33.906
Goddamn it!
- What?

52:34.240 --> 52:35.574
I lost cohesión again.

52:36.325 --> 52:38.244
Are you any closer?
- No.

52:38.911 --> 52:41.497
You know, I can't figure out
the B and C of it.

52:42.081 --> 52:43.165
The B and C?

52:44.667 --> 52:49.004
My 5th grade teacher told me that
genius is getting from A to D...

52:49.255 --> 52:51.590
...without having to go
through B and C.

52:52.007 --> 52:53.592
Sebastian can do that.

52:53.843 --> 52:57.429
But me, I gotta have the B and C.

53:00.850 --> 53:03.185
Hold on, Sebastian.
We're almost there.

53:05.187 --> 53:06.856
Come on, guys. Out of the way!

53:19.535 --> 53:21.620
I can't take much more testing.

53:21.871 --> 53:23.122
I know how hard it is.

53:23.372 --> 53:25.541
Bullshit. You don't know anything.

53:25.875 --> 53:27.626
This isn't easy for any of us.

53:27.877 --> 53:31.046
Fuck you, Matt! It is easy for you.

53:32.214 --> 53:34.466
I was to be in phase-shift
for three days.

53:34.717 --> 53:36.886
It's been 10 fucking days, all right?!

53:37.303 --> 53:41.390
Ten days of tissue tests, radiation
tests and your fucking needles!

53:42.725 --> 53:45.227
I can't fucking take it anymore.

53:45.561 --> 53:47.980
What I meant was...
- Fuck what you meant!

53:48.481 --> 53:49.565
And don't ever...

53:49.815 --> 53:52.067
Don't ever tell me
how hard you have it.

53:59.241 --> 54:02.077
Come on, Sebastian,
you're tired and you need to rest.

54:04.663 --> 54:08.167
I can't believe I gotta
spend another night in this place.

54:08.834 --> 54:11.504
We're trying to do everything we can.

54:12.338 --> 54:15.591
Yeah, that's not enough.

54:30.773 --> 54:32.358
There she is.

55:00.386 --> 55:03.472
L'd suck the tits right off of you.

55:03.639 --> 55:04.640
Hey.

55:04.807 --> 55:06.559
Dr. Caine, what's going on?

55:06.809 --> 55:10.229
wonk uoy tel ot yb deppots tsuJ
.elihw a rof tuo gniog m'I

55:10.646 --> 55:13.399
Wait. Going out?
Hold it a second. Dr. Caine.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.235
Sebastian.

55:16.735 --> 55:17.820
Dr. Caine.

55:18.070 --> 55:19.405
What do you mean?

55:19.738 --> 55:21.740
If I don't get out, I'll go nuts.

55:21.991 --> 55:24.326
You can't leave the compound.
- Why not?

55:24.660 --> 55:27.246
It's the rule.
- It's my rule, I just changed it.

55:27.580 --> 55:29.832
<i>Authorization.
- Caine 0027.</i>

55:30.166 --> 55:32.251
<i>Confirmed.
- You can't just change it.</i>

55:32.585 --> 55:35.921
I'm not gonna spend my life
in this godforsaken dump!

55:36.172 --> 55:38.757
I'm going out! Be back
in a couple of hours!

55:39.008 --> 55:40.676
Oh, shit!

55:48.017 --> 55:52.021
<i>Hello?
- It's Carter. We got a problem.</i>

56:09.538 --> 56:12.208
How's it going, Ed?
- Hey, doc.

56:13.375 --> 56:17.296
I haven't seen you in a while.
- You know how it is sometimes.

56:17.546 --> 56:18.464
Work, work, work.

56:18.714 --> 56:22.134
I was beginning to worry because
your car hadn't moved.

56:22.468 --> 56:24.470
Thanks a lot, Ed.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.222
But everything's cool.

57:05.928 --> 57:07.847
Hey, look. Look.

57:08.097 --> 57:11.433
Look at that.
- Man, he's weird.

57:13.102 --> 57:14.520
Oh, my God.
- Mommy! Mommy!

57:14.770 --> 57:17.106
Mommy! Mommy!
- What?

57:18.107 --> 57:19.275
What?
- Look, it's a ghost.

57:19.525 --> 57:22.862
Don't be ridiculous.
- Mom, it's a ghost.

57:23.946 --> 57:27.616
I'll meet you at the lab.
I'll go by his place just in case.

57:28.033 --> 57:29.034
I'll see you there.

57:29.618 --> 57:30.953
He could be here.

57:33.038 --> 57:34.540
He could be anywhere.

58:31.096 --> 58:32.264
Shit.

58:43.275 --> 58:45.277
Don't even think about it.

58:52.117 --> 58:53.619
Who's gonna know?

01:01:56.802 --> 01:01:58.637
Sebastian?

01:02:03.225 --> 01:02:05.060
Sebastian?

01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:17.907
Oh, shit.

01:02:40.095 --> 01:02:42.181
Matt, it's me. He was here.

01:02:42.431 --> 01:02:44.683
No, he took his mask off.

01:02:45.017 --> 01:02:48.521
He must be outside somewhere.
I don't know where he went.

01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:50.606
I'm coming back to the lab.

01:02:51.357 --> 01:02:54.610
How? How am I supposed to do that?
I can't fucking see him.

01:03:37.236 --> 01:03:39.655
You say you want us to shoot him?
I'm in.

01:03:39.905 --> 01:03:43.492
It's not a monkey, it's Dr. Caine.
Aren't we overreacting here?

01:03:43.742 --> 01:03:46.996
I don't give a rat's ass if we are.
Out there, he's at risk.

01:03:47.246 --> 01:03:51.000
If someone finds out what he is,
the whole program is destroyed.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:54.753
Jeez, relax.
Nobody's gonna find out.

01:03:55.004 --> 01:03:57.006
Can I still shoot him?
- Where have you been?

01:03:57.423 --> 01:03:58.507
I told Carter.

01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:02.344
I was getting stir-crazy.
I went home to pick up stuff.

01:04:02.678 --> 01:04:03.846
Bullshit.

01:04:04.096 --> 01:04:05.264
I went to your apartment.

01:04:05.514 --> 01:04:07.933
You did more than 'pick up stuff. '

01:04:08.184 --> 01:04:11.770
What are you talking about?
- You, of all people. How could you?

01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:13.856
What did you see in my apartment?

01:04:14.106 --> 01:04:15.941
I saw your face, your clothes.

01:04:16.192 --> 01:04:19.195
Sebastian, in public.
Why'd you have to go out in public?

01:04:19.445 --> 01:04:23.616
I'm still project leader.
It's my decisión to make.

01:04:24.116 --> 01:04:27.369
You're right. It's your decisión.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.874
But if you leave again, I swear
I'll go straight to the committee.

01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:35.127
Throw your career away?

01:04:35.794 --> 01:04:37.296
Not likely.

01:04:39.048 --> 01:04:40.049
Try me.

01:04:48.057 --> 01:04:49.642
So that's it, huh?

01:04:50.142 --> 01:04:51.977
I'm officially a fucking lab rat.

01:04:52.228 --> 01:04:54.480
You volunteered.
You knew the consequences.

01:04:55.898 --> 01:04:58.984
Next time you do inventory,
get me an exercise wheel.

01:04:59.235 --> 01:05:00.653
Yeah, sure.

01:05:02.238 --> 01:05:04.240
Let's pack it up and go home.

01:05:05.074 --> 01:05:08.244
Exercise wheel? Was he serious?
- What do you think?

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:10.079
Hey, Lin.
- Yeah?

01:05:10.246 --> 01:05:13.332
The committee knows
what we've done, don't they?

01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:18.671
Shit, Lin!
- Won't matter if we can get him back.

01:05:18.921 --> 01:05:22.424
I can't believe you did that!
- You have deniability, you didn't know.

01:05:23.509 --> 01:05:26.679
All I ask is please,
please don't fuck us.

01:05:32.434 --> 01:05:35.187
Think she'll say anything?
- No, she's in too far.

01:05:35.437 --> 01:05:37.189
She doesn't worry me.
- Sebastian.

01:05:37.439 --> 01:05:41.861
He's been gone longer than the
animals. It might affect his mind.

01:05:42.111 --> 01:05:43.696
What if it already has?

01:05:47.116 --> 01:05:48.284
Hold still.

01:05:53.289 --> 01:05:54.206
Good.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:58.878
So, what was it like?
- What do you mean?

01:05:59.211 --> 01:06:03.382
When you were out in the worid.
- I just walked around. You know.

01:06:03.632 --> 01:06:06.635
You just walked around.
Come on, there's more, right?

01:06:07.052 --> 01:06:08.304
Like what?

01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:10.806
Man, if it was me...

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.893
...I'd be fucking with people,
whispering in ears.

01:06:14.226 --> 01:06:17.396
L'd be hanging out at Victoria's
Secret. L'd be the king.

01:06:21.317 --> 01:06:22.902
Childish, don't you think?

01:06:23.402 --> 01:06:24.487
No.

01:06:25.738 --> 01:06:28.657
Well, it was late.
I wasn't out for very long.

01:06:29.074 --> 01:06:30.743
Did you see anybody?

01:06:30.993 --> 01:06:32.828
There was this one girl.

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.499
Did you mess with her?
- No.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.254
Well, maybe I scared her a little.
- Yeah?

01:06:42.755 --> 01:06:44.089
How'd that feel?

01:06:45.174 --> 01:06:46.592
I liked it.

01:06:48.928 --> 01:06:50.346
Nice.

01:08:09.675 --> 01:08:11.010
<i>Hello.
- Lin.</i>

01:08:11.177 --> 01:08:14.513
<i>Remember the B and C?
I think I found it.</i>

01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:19.100
55 percent reversión.
That's the best we've gotten yet.

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:24.189
Protein structure was a dead end. Key
was to manipulate radiation signature.

01:08:24.356 --> 01:08:27.526
75 percent. 80 percent.

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:29.778
82.
- Come on.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:31.529
We've got it.

01:08:31.697 --> 01:08:32.781
No, it's slowing.

01:08:33.032 --> 01:08:34.950
Be an optimist.
- It's slowing down.

01:08:35.201 --> 01:08:38.287
88. 92 percent.

01:08:39.371 --> 01:08:41.290
93 percent.

01:08:42.374 --> 01:08:44.376
94 percent.

01:08:45.377 --> 01:08:47.046
95 percent.

01:08:50.883 --> 01:08:52.218
No!
- Shit!

01:08:53.385 --> 01:08:58.224
Cellular bonds are collapsing.
- Full quantum cascade at 95 percent.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.975
Some breakthrough.

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:03.645
If I were on a table right now,
I'd be a steaming pile of flesh.

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:04.979
Don't tempt me.

01:09:05.231 --> 01:09:06.649
We're closer, which counts.

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:09.984
Closer! He just traded quantum
energy for stability!

01:09:10.236 --> 01:09:11.487
It's ludicrous.
- Come on.

01:09:11.737 --> 01:09:13.906
You're pissed you didn't think of it.
- Really?

01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:19.828
95 percent? That's not even
worth my time! For Christ sake.

01:09:19.995 --> 01:09:20.996
Asshole.

01:09:24.082 --> 01:09:26.752
At least now we have some hope.

01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:37.680
What?

01:09:39.265 --> 01:09:41.433
You're a fucking moron.
What is your problem?

01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:44.353
Matt is onto something and
he could use your help.

01:09:44.603 --> 01:09:46.604
Matt. Oh, yeah.

01:09:46.772 --> 01:09:49.274
Yeah, he's onto something, all right.

01:09:49.524 --> 01:09:52.778
He's on my coattails.
He's been riding them for years.

01:09:53.028 --> 01:09:56.448
Get off your fucking pedestal.
He's trying like hell to fix you.

01:09:57.616 --> 01:09:58.534
Or kill me.

01:10:00.119 --> 01:10:02.121
And you know what the sad part is?

01:10:02.454 --> 01:10:05.457
I have this gift and
I can't even use it.

01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:08.127
So now it's a gift.

01:10:08.377 --> 01:10:09.962
Damn right it's a gift.

01:10:10.212 --> 01:10:14.633
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd
let me out of this cage to explore it.

01:10:15.384 --> 01:10:20.139
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd
be with us trying to save your life.

01:10:22.057 --> 01:10:23.476
My life?

01:10:23.893 --> 01:10:25.644
I have no fucking life.

01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:27.480
I'm a prisoner.

01:10:29.982 --> 01:10:32.318
No, you're not a prisoner.
- Oh, yeah?

01:10:32.985 --> 01:10:35.905
Is that what you think when
you leave here at night?

01:10:36.155 --> 01:10:38.824
Is that how you alleviate
your guilt...

01:10:38.991 --> 01:10:43.829
...when I'm stuck in this shithole
and you're at home...

01:10:44.163 --> 01:10:46.165
...fucking your boyfriend?

01:10:49.919 --> 01:10:51.754
What bothers you most?

01:10:52.421 --> 01:10:54.507
That you don't have a life...

01:10:57.009 --> 01:10:58.677
...or that I do?

01:11:36.382 --> 01:11:38.551
Frank, I'm coming down to the lab.

01:11:38.968 --> 01:11:40.427
Don't you sleep?

01:11:40.636 --> 01:11:44.390
<i>Da Vinci never slept.
- Okay. I'm here if you need me.</i>

01:12:43.616 --> 01:12:45.659
No, no, no, no.

01:13:26.408 --> 01:13:28.244
Hello.

01:13:32.039 --> 01:13:33.999
Motherfucker...

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:38.003
If you were any later,
I would have started without you.

01:13:52.393 --> 01:13:53.352
Jesus!

01:14:05.197 --> 01:14:06.866
I don't see anything.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.708
Hello?

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:17.710
No.

01:14:17.918 --> 01:14:19.378
No, he's here.

01:14:19.712 --> 01:14:22.214
Yes, I'm sure. I'm staring at him.

01:14:22.798 --> 01:14:24.049
Is something wrong?

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:28.053
<i>You want me to wake him?
- No, I was just checking.</i>

01:14:32.475 --> 01:14:34.477
Who the fuck does she think she is?

01:14:34.727 --> 01:14:37.396
I'm not good enough for her?
I'm not good enough?

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:40.065
I'll show them both how good I am.

01:14:40.316 --> 01:14:41.567
Quiet!

01:14:44.153 --> 01:14:45.738
Quiet!

01:14:46.238 --> 01:14:48.073
You wanna fuck with me, bitch?

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.993
You know what happens when
you fuck with me?!

01:15:02.087 --> 01:15:05.758
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. No one.

01:15:16.602 --> 01:15:19.021
My, you're looking spry this morning.
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:19.271 --> 01:15:21.524
There's nothing more stimulating
than staying up...

01:15:21.774 --> 01:15:24.026
...watching someone else sleep.

01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:27.279
Good morning, gang.

01:15:27.446 --> 01:15:28.697
Good morning.

01:15:28.948 --> 01:15:31.909
Hi, Maggie. Good morning, giris.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.552
Sebastian...

01:15:50.261 --> 01:15:51.971
...you awake?

01:15:55.057 --> 01:15:56.976
I am now.

01:15:57.309 --> 01:15:59.979
Notice anything unusual last night?

01:16:00.146 --> 01:16:02.648
Nope, nothing at all. Why?

01:16:02.815 --> 01:16:05.568
Franklin 3, he's dead.

01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:08.571
So?

01:16:09.321 --> 01:16:11.532
So I thought maybe
you heard something.

01:16:13.117 --> 01:16:15.995
I was asleep.
- Yeah, all night?

01:16:16.787 --> 01:16:18.372
Are you accusing me of something?

01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:22.168
No, it just doesn't make sense,
does it, a dog dying just like that?

01:16:22.334 --> 01:16:26.005
Look, I know how you feel about them,
Sarah, but animals do die.

01:16:26.422 --> 01:16:29.884
It's simply a fact of life.

01:16:42.605 --> 01:16:43.689
That's all night.

01:16:43.898 --> 01:16:47.359
So he never left the room?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:16:47.568 --> 01:16:50.529
I don't know.
Why would he kill a dog, right?

01:17:17.139 --> 01:17:18.557
Hello?

01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:28.400
Sebastian?

01:17:33.072 --> 01:17:34.949
Sebastian, this is not funny.

01:18:17.116 --> 01:18:18.868
What are you doing here?
- Where is he?

01:18:19.118 --> 01:18:20.870
He's asleep, why?

01:18:22.288 --> 01:18:23.372
I'll be right back.

01:18:27.168 --> 01:18:28.794
Sebastian?

01:18:57.948 --> 01:19:00.493
Matt, activate alpha call.
I want everyone in here now.

01:19:12.505 --> 01:19:15.174
Working late?
- That's what they pay us for.

01:19:30.856 --> 01:19:34.360
It's really pretty clever.
All it does is loop the same image.

01:19:34.527 --> 01:19:36.028
What do we do now? Go after him?

01:19:36.487 --> 01:19:38.697
No. We're going to the committee.

01:19:38.948 --> 01:19:41.033
Shouldn't we wait and talk to him?

01:19:41.283 --> 01:19:43.536
He killed a dog with his bare hands.

01:19:43.744 --> 01:19:46.121
You were there?
- He went out every night...

01:19:46.372 --> 01:19:49.500
...with absolute disregard
for his safety and ours.

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:52.127
What's he done?
- I don't wanna think about it.

01:19:52.378 --> 01:19:55.256
Are we in trouble?
- You didn't mislead the committee.

01:19:55.881 --> 01:19:57.466
We'll take responsibility.

01:19:57.716 --> 01:20:00.427
What do we do when he comes back?
- Nothing.

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:02.721
The committee will bring security.

01:20:02.888 --> 01:20:04.723
We'll brief you tomorrow morning.

01:20:08.894 --> 01:20:12.731
<i>Authorization, please.
- McKay 1-Delta-835.</i>

01:20:13.315 --> 01:20:16.735
You sure about this?
- It's the right thing to do.

01:20:25.244 --> 01:20:28.330
Given Sebastian's history,
this behavior doesn't surprise me.

01:20:28.497 --> 01:20:29.832
You should've said something.

01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:33.586
I had a lot of faith in you,
thinking you'd take care of this.

01:20:33.836 --> 01:20:35.963
I know what we did was wrong.

01:20:36.255 --> 01:20:40.843
Wrong doesn't even begin
to describe it.

01:20:41.343 --> 01:20:43.012
Let's leave it here.

01:20:47.016 --> 01:20:49.852
I'll call General Caster and
convene the committee.

01:20:50.186 --> 01:20:52.521
You go back to the lab.
We'll handle him.

01:20:52.771 --> 01:20:54.273
Is there anything we can do?

01:20:54.523 --> 01:20:57.276
You might think about
clearing out your offices.

01:20:58.777 --> 01:21:01.780
For what it's worth,
we're both very sorry.

01:21:02.114 --> 01:21:04.366
A little late for apologies.

01:21:07.953 --> 01:21:09.121
Howard?

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.207
What was that about?

01:21:11.373 --> 01:21:14.126
Just a screwup at work.
- How bad?

01:21:14.376 --> 01:21:16.378
Bad enough to wake a few generals.

01:22:13.978 --> 01:22:15.479
Hi, boss.

01:22:21.527 --> 01:22:22.528
Martha!

01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:31.662
Help!

01:22:33.455 --> 01:22:34.373
Martha!

01:22:35.374 --> 01:22:37.543
Howard?
- Help! Help!

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:06.113
Howard!

01:23:29.845 --> 01:23:32.848
Why so jumpy?
- You just surprised me.

01:23:33.265 --> 01:23:35.267
No 'good morning' for me today?

01:23:35.768 --> 01:23:37.353
You don't love me anymore.

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:40.523
Just in a hurry.
- Well, that's okay.

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.359
It's gonna be a busy day.

01:23:50.616 --> 01:23:51.951
When did he get back?

01:23:52.284 --> 01:23:55.538
Three a. m. He's been wandering
around the lab ever since.

01:23:56.121 --> 01:23:57.039
Kramer called yet?

01:23:57.373 --> 01:24:00.042
He's probably still meeting
with the committee.

01:24:00.543 --> 01:24:03.712
We should have heard something.
I'm calling.

01:24:06.799 --> 01:24:08.634
Hello, is Dr. Kramer there?

01:24:09.301 --> 01:24:10.469
What?

01:24:13.973 --> 01:24:15.349
Oh, my God.

01:24:16.725 --> 01:24:19.645
What's wrong?
- He's dead.

01:24:19.979 --> 01:24:22.898
What?
- He drowned in his pool last night.

01:24:28.946 --> 01:24:30.573
General Caster, please.

01:24:30.823 --> 01:24:33.659
Hello. Hello?

01:24:36.287 --> 01:24:38.080
There's no dial tone.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:44.044
There's no outside line here either.
- We'd better alert security.

01:24:47.673 --> 01:24:51.010
<i>Authorization, please.
- McKay 1-Delta-835.</i>

01:24:51.677 --> 01:24:54.180
<i>Authorization invalid.
Request denied.</i>

01:24:54.597 --> 01:24:58.517
That's a first. McKay 1-Delta-835.

01:24:59.101 --> 01:25:00.936
<i>Authorization invalid.
Request denied.</i>

01:25:01.687 --> 01:25:03.272
Let me try mine.

01:25:04.190 --> 01:25:06.609
Kensington 2-Romeo-159.

01:25:06.859 --> 01:25:09.778
<i>Authorization invalid.
Request denied.</i>

01:25:13.949 --> 01:25:15.451
We've got a problem.

01:25:19.205 --> 01:25:20.206
I don't believe this.

01:25:20.456 --> 01:25:25.252
When will they start looking for us?
- It could take a couple of days.

01:25:25.544 --> 01:25:28.714
Can you hack into the system?
- Already in.

01:25:31.008 --> 01:25:34.470
Some security system.
- It's just he's extraordinary.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.139
Someone's more extraordinary
than me.

01:25:38.557 --> 01:25:40.309
What is it?
- The system's fine.

01:25:40.559 --> 01:25:44.730
Our access codes have been
removed. There's only one left.

01:25:49.819 --> 01:25:52.363
So we're trapped?
- We'll get him.

01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:53.948
Let me have one.

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:12.716
Sebastian?

01:26:23.435 --> 01:26:24.854
He's not in here.

01:26:27.439 --> 01:26:30.776
Okay, Sebastian, fun's over.
Tell us where you are.

01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:34.530
<i>Sorry, Linda, but I can't
let you turn me in.</i>

01:26:36.365 --> 01:26:37.950
Sebastian, where are you?

01:26:38.534 --> 01:26:40.327
<i>You have no idea what it's like.</i>

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.874
<i>The power of it, the freedom.
I can't let that go.</i>

01:26:45.875 --> 01:26:49.962
Whatever you're planning,
the phones, the elevator...

01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:53.424
...it's not gonna work.
They know about you.

01:26:53.716 --> 01:26:54.925
<i>No, they don't.</i>

01:26:55.384 --> 01:26:57.636
<i>Kramer died before
he could tell a soul.</i>

01:26:58.304 --> 01:26:59.680
<i>I saw to that.</i>

01:26:59.889 --> 01:27:00.890
Jesus.

01:27:01.307 --> 01:27:05.853
<i>You realize what you're saying?
- It's amazing what you can do...</i>

01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:09.732
<i>...when you don't have to look
at yourself in the mirror anymore.</i>

01:27:10.566 --> 01:27:12.109
<i>Sebastian.
- Goodbye, Linda.</i>

01:27:12.318 --> 01:27:13.986
Sebastian!

01:27:14.987 --> 01:27:16.238
Shit!

01:27:18.491 --> 01:27:19.825
Where's Janice?

01:27:20.826 --> 01:27:22.244
She was right behind us.

01:27:22.578 --> 01:27:24.121
Oh, fuck.

01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:27.249
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God!

01:27:33.839 --> 01:27:36.509
Janice? Janice!

01:27:38.844 --> 01:27:40.304
Janice?

01:27:43.015 --> 01:27:44.099
In there.

01:27:47.102 --> 01:27:49.355
Darts.
- Is it Sebastian?

01:27:57.947 --> 01:27:59.573
Oh, my God.

01:27:59.865 --> 01:28:00.866
Shit!

01:28:01.158 --> 01:28:02.618
Oh, my God.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.372
She was right behind us.

01:28:06.705 --> 01:28:09.041
How could he do this?

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.877
He snapped. He fucking snapped.

01:28:12.378 --> 01:28:13.629
It's worse.

01:28:14.171 --> 01:28:16.549
He's thought this through.
- What?

01:28:16.799 --> 01:28:18.884
He knew we were gonna turn him in.

01:28:19.343 --> 01:28:23.055
He knew that his career would be
over and his only way out...

01:28:23.305 --> 01:28:27.393
...is to make sure no one knows
what he is or what he's done.

01:28:27.726 --> 01:28:31.147
Which means he'll get rid of us.
- Goddamn you!

01:28:31.564 --> 01:28:33.649
You could've stopped this!
- Back off.

01:28:33.899 --> 01:28:35.901
You risked our lives!
- Shut up!

01:28:36.152 --> 01:28:38.237
Don't tell her to shut up!
She's right!

01:28:38.487 --> 01:28:41.907
I don't care if she's right!
I don't care whose fault this is!

01:28:42.324 --> 01:28:44.743
I just wanna know,
what do we do now?

01:28:46.829 --> 01:28:48.747
Frank, can you restore the codes?

01:28:49.915 --> 01:28:52.918
I'll try.
- We can't afford to sit here and wait.

01:28:53.169 --> 01:28:56.338
We are not gonna wait.
We are gonna take him down.

01:28:57.339 --> 01:28:58.757
Ever use this thing before?

01:28:59.049 --> 01:29:02.136
We designed it to help find
the rats we kept dropping.

01:29:02.344 --> 01:29:04.096
Too small for thermal scans.

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:07.266
Connecting.
- Powering up.

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:09.768
Activating motion detectors.

01:29:10.269 --> 01:29:11.854
We've got movement.

01:29:12.771 --> 01:29:14.940
Corridor six.
- There he is.

01:29:17.359 --> 01:29:18.694
Got it.

01:29:20.029 --> 01:29:21.363
Check.
- Check.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:24.033
Matt, be careful.
- Just watch our backs.

01:29:24.283 --> 01:29:25.951
Ready?
- Let's do it.

01:29:34.293 --> 01:29:36.545
Take a left at the next corridor.

01:29:36.795 --> 01:29:38.798
Could we trap him in corridor eight?

01:29:39.048 --> 01:29:42.468
<i>If he keeps heading that way.
- I'm on five.</i>

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.230
Anything?
- I think we can climb out.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.732
There's a ladder in
the elevator shaft.

01:29:58.651 --> 01:30:00.402
Shit, I lost him.

01:30:00.986 --> 01:30:02.738
<i>I lost him.
- He stopped moving.</i>

01:30:05.282 --> 01:30:06.283
It's me. It's me.

01:30:08.577 --> 01:30:10.246
You have anything?
- No, nothing.

01:30:10.579 --> 01:30:11.997
How did he get by us?

01:30:12.248 --> 01:30:13.582
He couldn't have.

01:30:13.749 --> 01:30:15.501
Sebastian!

01:30:16.168 --> 01:30:18.587
There. Behind the pipes.

01:30:21.507 --> 01:30:22.758
Dr. Caine?

01:30:23.676 --> 01:30:26.095
Can you hear me?
- I'm taking him down.

01:30:27.596 --> 01:30:28.848
Cover me.

01:30:29.515 --> 01:30:30.432
Covered.

01:30:44.864 --> 01:30:48.284
It's just a vent.
It's just a goddamn vent.

01:30:54.707 --> 01:30:56.458
Let him go! Let him fucking go!

01:31:09.972 --> 01:31:11.307
<i>Matt, what's happening?</i>

01:31:11.974 --> 01:31:13.809
Carter's down! He's hurt bad!

01:31:14.059 --> 01:31:14.977
Get out of there.

01:31:15.561 --> 01:31:17.146
Where the fuck is Sebastian?!

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:19.815
Shit. He's right on top of you!

01:31:29.325 --> 01:31:32.661
Where's he headed?!
- He's coming this way, to the lab.

01:31:33.162 --> 01:31:35.498
The doors are closing!
He's shutting me in!

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.751
<i>You have him?
- I do.</i>

01:31:39.251 --> 01:31:41.670
He's still there.
He's on your side of the door.

01:31:42.004 --> 01:31:44.006
Where?
- He's right in front of you.

01:31:44.256 --> 01:31:45.508
He's coming at you!

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.930
I got thermals all over the place.
Five or six.

01:31:54.767 --> 01:31:55.851
I'm losing resolution!

01:31:59.939 --> 01:32:03.359
He's pumping out heat.
You won't be able to see him.

01:32:04.527 --> 01:32:07.029
The air's the same temperature
as his body.

01:32:07.279 --> 01:32:08.364
He's trapped.
- I'm going.

01:32:08.697 --> 01:32:10.783
It's not safe.
- Get Carter! Meet at the lab.

01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:12.868
We shouldn't separate!
- Get Carter.

01:32:13.118 --> 01:32:15.120
Marco. Polo.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.792
Marco. Polo.

01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:22.628
You missed.

01:32:22.878 --> 01:32:27.716
Now'd be a good time to pay that tab.
- Come on! You think you can take me?!

01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:29.301
Come on!

01:32:36.308 --> 01:32:37.393
What happened to you?

01:32:37.643 --> 01:32:40.479
Was it the serum that fucked you up,
or the power?

01:32:42.314 --> 01:32:47.069
Aren't you the fucked up one?!
Dining on my leftovers...

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:50.239
...no life except the one
you borrowed from me!

01:32:51.323 --> 01:32:53.742
Even with Linda.
- She left you, remember?

01:32:53.993 --> 01:32:58.247
Jesus Christ, I can't imagine what
the fuck she sees in a loser like you!

01:32:58.497 --> 01:33:00.249
I'm not a deranged asshole!

01:33:00.499 --> 01:33:02.835
No, but you're weak!

01:33:07.256 --> 01:33:10.759
I thought killing you would be hard!
But I kind of like it.

01:33:23.856 --> 01:33:28.110
Oh, my God. Fuck! His pulse
is weak! His breathing's shallow!

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.029
He'll be okay!
- No, it's severe!

01:33:30.279 --> 01:33:32.865
He's gonna be okay!
- Get down here!

01:33:33.115 --> 01:33:35.451
Keep applying pressure
until I get back!

01:33:35.701 --> 01:33:37.536
Where you going?
- He needs blood.

01:33:37.786 --> 01:33:40.539
Wait for the others!
- Lf I wait, he'll die!

01:33:40.789 --> 01:33:43.125
Sarah! Fuck!

01:33:46.545 --> 01:33:48.130
Sebastian?

01:33:52.134 --> 01:33:53.636
Sebastian?

01:33:53.969 --> 01:33:55.387
Sarah?

01:33:57.223 --> 01:33:59.475
God, I told them to meet us here.

01:34:13.155 --> 01:34:14.490
Frank?

01:34:17.493 --> 01:34:18.828
Oh, God.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.020
Come on. Give me one step,
Sebastian. One fucking step.

01:34:45.604 --> 01:34:46.605
Move!

01:34:55.614 --> 01:34:56.782
Fuck.

01:34:57.449 --> 01:34:58.534
Hey.

01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:00.202
Quite a mess.

01:35:07.459 --> 01:35:09.044
Fuck! You motherfuck...

01:35:10.379 --> 01:35:11.630
Get off!

01:35:12.882 --> 01:35:16.802
We had so much fun the last time.
- No, please don't. Please.

01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:18.637
Sweet dreams.

01:35:28.147 --> 01:35:29.398
You know...

01:35:30.983 --> 01:35:33.319
...I've always admired
your feistiness.

01:35:49.752 --> 01:35:52.421
Goddamn it, Carter!
Don't die on me now!

01:35:52.588 --> 01:35:56.425
Sarah, I'm losing him! Sarah!
- Frank.

01:35:57.176 --> 01:35:58.761
Where is she?
- He needed blood.

01:35:59.011 --> 01:36:01.430
She went alone?
- He would've died!

01:36:02.181 --> 01:36:03.516
He's dead.

01:36:04.266 --> 01:36:05.518
Come on.

01:36:15.361 --> 01:36:16.362
Wait.

01:36:22.368 --> 01:36:23.869
Sarah?

01:36:31.377 --> 01:36:33.546
Matt.
- Keep spraying.

01:36:37.383 --> 01:36:38.801
Oh, no.

01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:46.308
Nothing.

01:36:47.893 --> 01:36:49.562
What's happening?!

01:36:51.564 --> 01:36:54.316
She's dead, isn't she? Motherfucker!

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.152
Frank!

01:36:59.905 --> 01:37:00.906
Jesus.

01:37:08.414 --> 01:37:10.332
I got it. I got it.

01:37:11.917 --> 01:37:13.502
Oh, God!

01:37:25.931 --> 01:37:27.183
Bye-bye, Linda.

01:37:28.267 --> 01:37:30.186
Have fun with your boyfriend.

01:37:33.105 --> 01:37:34.607
We're locked in.

01:37:36.442 --> 01:37:37.943
How bad?

01:37:41.947 --> 01:37:44.950
You're losing blood,
but he didn't hit any organs.

01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:47.286
Frank?
- No.

01:37:50.623 --> 01:37:53.292
I gotta find something
to close the wound.

01:37:58.547 --> 01:37:59.799
Shit.

01:38:03.803 --> 01:38:05.054
Talk to me.

01:38:05.304 --> 01:38:08.307
Everything is spinning.

01:38:34.667 --> 01:38:37.837
Are you still with me?
- I can't feel anything.

01:38:39.505 --> 01:38:40.840
Can you feel this?

01:38:42.091 --> 01:38:43.342
A little.

01:38:43.759 --> 01:38:44.677
Come on.

01:38:44.927 --> 01:38:46.345
I need you to fight this.

01:38:46.679 --> 01:38:48.848
I need you to stay awake.
- I'm trying.

01:38:49.348 --> 01:38:52.017
Come on. Talk to me.

01:38:52.518 --> 01:38:53.519
Talk to me!

01:38:55.271 --> 01:38:59.275
Matt. Matt! Matt!

01:39:29.054 --> 01:39:30.890
Hello, face.

01:40:20.439 --> 01:40:22.942
We are not gonna die in here.

01:42:21.227 --> 01:42:23.646
I'll be back with help. I promise.

01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:54.343
<i>Authorization, please.
- Caine 0027.</i>

01:42:54.593 --> 01:42:56.095
<i>Confirmed.
- Thank you.</i>

01:42:56.262 --> 01:42:57.847
Sebastian!

01:42:59.098 --> 01:43:02.101
I can't let you leave.
- Sorry, you don't have a choice.

01:43:02.268 --> 01:43:04.103
Oh, yes, I do.

01:43:20.619 --> 01:43:23.956
You think you're God?
I'll show you God!

01:43:57.072 --> 01:43:58.491
Shit!

01:44:43.369 --> 01:44:45.287
I always knew you were a bitch!

01:44:51.794 --> 01:44:52.795
Bitch!

01:44:56.132 --> 01:44:58.217
No wonder it didn't work out
between us!

01:45:07.226 --> 01:45:09.562
Stay the fuck away from her!

01:45:12.731 --> 01:45:15.067
Thought I'd save you for a change.

01:45:45.181 --> 01:45:47.183
Come on. I heard an explosión!

01:46:03.532 --> 01:46:04.783
Don't touch it!
- What?

01:46:05.117 --> 01:46:06.952
It's nitro.
- We gotta stop it.

01:46:07.286 --> 01:46:08.787
No, we can't! Come on!

01:46:09.038 --> 01:46:11.040
There's a ladder in the elevator.

01:46:15.461 --> 01:46:17.630
Can you climb?
- Do I have a choice?

01:46:36.482 --> 01:46:38.067
You go first.

01:47:28.367 --> 01:47:29.535
Move!

01:47:41.547 --> 01:47:42.631
Oh, shit.

01:47:43.716 --> 01:47:44.967
Stick to the side!

01:47:58.314 --> 01:48:00.065
Lt's coming back down!

01:48:05.571 --> 01:48:06.489
Down! Go down!

01:48:36.519 --> 01:48:37.436
Holy shit.

01:48:40.856 --> 01:48:42.691
We better go before it slips.

01:49:08.801 --> 01:49:10.136
Matt!

01:49:16.976 --> 01:49:19.562
Get off of me! Get off of me!

01:49:44.003 --> 01:49:45.337
Matt.

01:50:02.605 --> 01:50:06.609
Let go of me!
- One last kiss.

01:50:08.194 --> 01:50:09.945
For old times' sake.

01:50:30.382 --> 01:50:31.300
Go to hell.

01:50:59.328 --> 01:51:00.329
Come on.

01:51:17.596 --> 01:51:19.098
Oh, my God.

01:51:19.348 --> 01:51:22.685
Not God. Not anymore.
