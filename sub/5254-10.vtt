00:00.667 --> 00:01.932
<i>Previously on Faking It...</i>

00:01.964 --> 00:03.510
It was taking you forever to get these.

00:03.512 --> 00:05.300
Promise to always wear mine.

00:05.330 --> 00:08.069
Don't eat that homophobic sandwich!

00:08.099 --> 00:10.154
- I'm expecting a text...
- Begging to get back together.

00:10.184 --> 00:10.867
Any minute.

00:10.897 --> 00:12.957
Have either of you seen Karma?
She knows about me and Liam.

00:12.987 --> 00:14.442
Why does it always feel
like you're pulling away?

00:14.472 --> 00:15.710
Meet me in the courtyard after school.

00:15.740 --> 00:16.506
I'll explain everything.

00:16.536 --> 00:19.058
You forgive us both, or you hate us both.

00:19.088 --> 00:20.832
Then I hate you both!

00:24.295 --> 00:25.332
Mom?

00:25.362 --> 00:29.673
(Humming)

00:29.703 --> 00:32.861
- Who died?
- Darling, whatever do you mean?

00:32.891 --> 00:34.313
Whenever something terrible happens,

00:34.343 --> 00:37.282
you make French toast and
talk like you're in gone with the wind.

00:37.679 --> 00:40.864
Nobody died, but Karma was here.

00:40.894 --> 00:42.154
What did she say?

00:42.184 --> 00:43.767
She didn't say much of anything.

00:43.797 --> 00:46.569
She just dropped off that box.

00:49.157 --> 00:52.192
Please tell me it
doesn't have a head in it.

00:56.331 --> 00:59.633
You two have more fights
than Madison Square Garden.

00:59.663 --> 01:01.852
It'll blow over.

01:03.238 --> 01:04.988
Oh, what is it?

01:05.018 --> 01:07.176
What happened?

01:08.410 --> 01:11.578
You know that guy you saw
sneak out of my window?

01:11.663 --> 01:13.293
Of course.

01:13.915 --> 01:16.666
He was Karma's boyfriend.

01:16.718 --> 01:17.911
Oh.

01:18.336 --> 01:21.504
Well, you can always
make a new best friend.

01:21.556 --> 01:24.396
No, don't say that.
We're gonna get past this.

01:24.626 --> 01:28.550
Baby, I'm sorry, but you
broke the cardinal rule

01:28.580 --> 01:30.079
of the girl code:

01:30.132 --> 01:32.704
"Thou shalt not sleep with
the best friend's boyfriend".

01:32.734 --> 01:34.122
You never taught me that,

01:34.152 --> 01:36.591
and Karma and I are more
than just best friends.

01:36.621 --> 01:39.294
We're soul mates.
The normal rules don't apply to us.

01:39.324 --> 01:42.158
We're spending the rest
of our lives together,

01:42.244 --> 01:44.711
as soon as I get her to speak to me.

01:45.013 --> 01:48.073
Oh, and I hope you're right.

01:48.671 --> 01:50.800
Oh... Oh, oh.

01:51.130 --> 01:53.169
Mr. Booker, why do you deserve

01:53.221 --> 01:55.260
The Jackson Lee Youth Art fellowship?

01:55.290 --> 01:56.873
Well, my girlfriend dumped me.

01:56.958 --> 01:59.292
She hates me so much, she
metaphorically killed me,

01:59.322 --> 02:00.469
and things are unbearable at home

02:00.499 --> 02:02.851
since I told everything
that my sister is my mother.

02:02.881 --> 02:04.769
So I think I deserve

02:04.799 --> 02:06.499
to get the hell out
of town next semester.

02:06.529 --> 02:08.251
Okay, I think the one
I wrote for you is better.

02:08.281 --> 02:11.035
All that crap about learning and growing?
It sounds like bull(bleep).

02:11.065 --> 02:13.040
Yeah, well, people who
give out fellowships,

02:13.075 --> 02:16.058
- love bull(bleep).
- (Phone beeps)

02:16.862 --> 02:17.904
Skwerkel alert.

02:17.934 --> 02:20.735
"Duke and his new girlfriend
spotted at church."

02:20.765 --> 02:23.144
Seriously, he's taking
her to the House of God?

02:23.174 --> 02:24.934
He wouldn't even take me
to the house of pancakes.

02:24.970 --> 02:25.575
Sorry, man.

02:25.605 --> 02:28.093
It must be hard for you to
see him with someone else.

02:28.123 --> 02:29.339
Yeah, but not as hard as it would be,

02:29.424 --> 02:30.957
if someone sent his stubbl account

02:31.043 --> 02:33.164
to TMZ and outed him as a big fake.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.066
- You didn't do that, did you?
- No.

02:35.096 --> 02:36.646
No more outing people, remember?

02:36.731 --> 02:38.148
Being a good person sucks.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.900
Just throw yourself into something else,

02:40.936 --> 02:43.269
like I am with this fellowship.

02:44.906 --> 02:46.606
Leila, Lisbeth, listen up.

02:46.691 --> 02:47.924
I'm running for Class President,

02:47.954 --> 02:51.244
and you two are my campaign managers.

02:51.679 --> 02:53.690
I've been distracted lately from my goal

02:53.720 --> 02:55.882
of turning hester into a
school I'd want to go to,

02:55.967 --> 02:57.122
but I'm back on track now,

02:57.152 --> 02:59.007
and I need 100 signatures to qualify,

02:59.037 --> 03:00.924
so chop, chop.

03:02.190 --> 03:04.524
Remember when you tried
this with Homecoming Queen?

03:04.609 --> 03:06.849
It only made everyone hate you more.

03:06.879 --> 03:08.128
And you're only social chair

03:08.180 --> 03:09.796
because you blackmailed the principal.

03:09.848 --> 03:11.077
Now I know how things work around here.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.739
I just need some stupid
touchy-feely issue to get votes.

03:13.769 --> 03:15.724
Then after I win, I'll go back
to my true self.

03:15.754 --> 03:18.722
So what do I care about?

03:18.752 --> 03:21.293
Lately, all you care about is Theo.

03:21.323 --> 03:24.010
Cared about, Lisbeth. Past tense.

03:24.062 --> 03:25.645
That ass(bleep) Is dead to me.

03:25.681 --> 03:30.706
He and that slutty bitch Brandi
are perfect for each other.

03:30.991 --> 03:32.852
That was quite a night, huh?

03:32.882 --> 03:35.141
How you doing?

03:35.171 --> 03:37.190
Let me go.

03:37.737 --> 03:40.472
I will once you tell me where
you got this pot brownie.

03:40.924 --> 03:44.100
Faking It - 2x10
"Busted"

03:44.130 --> 03:47.037
- sync & corrections by wolfen -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:47.919 --> 03:49.869
Don't worry. I forgive you.

03:49.955 --> 03:51.259
I feel awful.

03:51.289 --> 03:53.011
I know how much you love chocolate chip.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.463
Karma, can we please just talk.

03:54.493 --> 03:56.331
I'll just have a peanut butter.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.699
- But Amy's allergic.
- Good point.

04:00.565 --> 04:04.162
Thank you, Irma, for being a true friend.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.292
Don't worry. I'm on it.

04:07.322 --> 04:08.905
Just need to figure out a plan.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.495
(Phone rings)

04:10.525 --> 04:11.513
Sorry.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.315
8 minutes, 29 seconds.

04:13.345 --> 04:15.300
That's how long it takes
for me to set up our tent.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.250
I've been practicing.

04:16.281 --> 04:17.697
Reagan, about camping.

04:17.749 --> 04:20.148
- Why does your voice sound like that?
- Like what?

04:20.178 --> 04:22.224
Like you're gonna back out of this trip.

04:22.254 --> 04:23.425
Am I moving too fast?

04:23.455 --> 04:25.460
Camping is one step away from a u-haul.

04:25.490 --> 04:28.157
No, and I'm still gonna be there.

04:28.243 --> 04:31.149
It's just... I got in a fight with Karma.

04:31.179 --> 04:32.545
You two are always getting into fights.

04:32.575 --> 04:33.763
Can't this wait until we get back?

04:33.793 --> 04:34.526
<i>No, it can't.</i>

04:34.556 --> 04:36.233
I need a little bit of
time to smooth things over.

04:36.263 --> 04:39.908
- Please?
- You have until 6:00.

04:39.938 --> 04:43.356
After that, I'm leaving
with or without you.

04:43.391 --> 04:45.275
It would be an honor to learn

04:45.360 --> 04:48.066
from such a talented
and prolific hester alum.

04:48.096 --> 04:49.596
I know I would grow as an artist.

04:49.631 --> 04:51.281
Don't suck up, kid. I hate bull(bleep).

04:51.311 --> 04:54.047
Now, tell me, what were you
trying to say with this piece?

04:54.077 --> 04:55.301
Well, it's art.

04:55.387 --> 04:57.220
It means whatever you think it means.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.021
Hello? Is anybody home?

05:00.051 --> 05:02.258
You're making your audience
do most of the work here, man.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.366
What's the point of hammering
(bleep) To other (bleep)

05:04.396 --> 05:05.634
If it doesn't mean anything?

05:05.664 --> 05:08.081
A true artist has intention, so tell me

05:08.166 --> 05:10.822
what you are trying
to say with this piece.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.407
Don't tell me that it
represents your journey

05:12.437 --> 05:14.237
or some of the bs you
think I want to hear.

05:14.267 --> 05:17.162
- Tell me something real.
- I don't have intention, okay?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.658
I've been through a lot of crap,

05:18.688 --> 05:21.699
and making art is the only
thing that makes me feel okay

05:21.729 --> 05:23.791
for one second.

05:25.388 --> 05:27.656
Is that real enough for you?

05:27.686 --> 05:29.808
That hit me right here. Right here.

05:29.838 --> 05:31.838
Too bad your piece doesn't.

05:32.435 --> 05:33.863
- Lauren for president.
- Vote for Lauren.

05:33.893 --> 05:35.413
Lauren for president.

05:35.443 --> 05:37.415
And that's why I feel so strongly

05:37.445 --> 05:39.278
about my campaign platform:

05:39.331 --> 05:41.470
Abolishing the grade system.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.139
Because how are we
supposed to truly learn

05:44.169 --> 05:46.057
if we're learning against each other?

05:46.087 --> 05:47.587
How do you respond to
those who are saying

05:47.639 --> 05:49.722
you're just pretending to
care about these issues,

05:49.758 --> 05:50.529
so you can win?

05:50.559 --> 05:51.538
It hurts my heart,

05:51.568 --> 05:54.366
but as far as I know,
I'm running unopposed.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.117
<i>Thanks, guys. Yeah, vote for me.</i>

05:56.147 --> 05:58.937
Here, vote for Shane. Vote for me.

05:58.967 --> 06:02.407
Hey, ladies. Button?

06:02.437 --> 06:04.637
- What the (bleep) Is this?
- Inspiring, right?

06:04.689 --> 06:07.112
The public beckoned me,
and I was hesitant at first.

06:07.142 --> 06:08.530
Campaigns really consume your life,

06:08.560 --> 06:10.899
but my schedule has
cleared up as of late,

06:10.929 --> 06:12.923
and I'm ready to eat, sleep,
and breathe this election.

06:12.953 --> 06:14.513
How are the signatures going, Wen?

06:14.599 --> 06:15.453
We're six away.

06:15.483 --> 06:17.322
And I just got our first polling data.

06:17.352 --> 06:19.390
You have almost
Universal Brand Awareness,

06:19.420 --> 06:21.309
and your likability is through the roof.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.789
People want to be your best friend.

06:22.819 --> 06:23.828
(Chuckles)

06:23.858 --> 06:25.658
Wendy, stop. You're making me blush.

06:25.688 --> 06:27.582
She's the best in the
business. Such a get.

06:27.612 --> 06:30.452
Speaking of, let's go
get those last signatures.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.265
Toodles.

06:32.574 --> 06:35.156
I have to go where the story is.

06:36.671 --> 06:38.454
Take it easy on the free samples, guys.

06:38.484 --> 06:40.643
I'm gonna have to start charging soon.

06:40.673 --> 06:43.181
- Just kidding.
- I don't understand.

06:43.211 --> 06:45.628
If you need to talk to Karma,
can't you just say,

06:45.713 --> 06:47.179
"Karma, I need to talk to you"?

06:47.215 --> 06:49.548
I can't; she hates me, which
is why I need your help.

06:49.601 --> 06:51.100
Oh, whatever's going on,

06:51.185 --> 06:52.545
I don't think she'd want me involved.

06:52.575 --> 06:54.015
<i>Mother?</i>

06:54.222 --> 06:55.672
Can you please remind this customer

06:55.757 --> 06:58.213
that we reserve the right
to refuse service to anyone?

06:58.243 --> 06:59.776
What happened between you two?

06:59.828 --> 07:03.307
(Tires squeal, sirens wail)

07:11.594 --> 07:13.756
Are you the proprietors of
the Good Karma Juice truck?

07:14.192 --> 07:15.225
I have a warrant for your arrest

07:15.255 --> 07:17.281
for the sale and distribution
of illegal drugs.

07:17.311 --> 07:17.861
What?

07:17.891 --> 07:19.162
You have the right to remain silent.

07:19.192 --> 07:22.233
Anything say can and will be used
against you you in a court of law...

07:23.138 --> 07:24.838
This is gonna get cleared up, right?

07:24.868 --> 07:27.336
I mean, you guys aren't
drug dealers, are you?

07:27.366 --> 07:29.760
Technically, yes.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.740
What do you think made the
special brownies special?

07:31.770 --> 07:32.525
Love?

07:32.555 --> 07:34.227
Your mom and I don't view weed as a drug.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.683
I mean, to us, it's medicine.

07:35.713 --> 07:37.346
And we only provide it to those in need.

07:37.382 --> 07:39.203
We sell mostly to nursing homes.

07:39.233 --> 07:42.837
Wait, doesn't Phyllis Finnegan's
grandson go here?

07:43.253 --> 07:46.171
I knew 20 brownies a week
was a lot to treat glaucoma.

07:46.201 --> 07:48.590
Wait, no, I didn't do anything.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.659
Till this is sorted out,
everyone who sold goods

07:50.689 --> 07:51.660
from the truck is a suspect.

07:51.690 --> 07:53.834
- That includes you.
- Hey, let her go.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.331
I-I vouch for her. She
can stay here with me.

07:56.366 --> 07:59.868
Never mind. Take me away.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.753
(Engine turns over)

08:06.677 --> 08:08.649
You've been lying to us the whole time?

08:08.679 --> 08:09.695
I thought we were friends,

08:09.725 --> 08:11.313
and friends don't arrest
friends' girlfriends.

08:11.343 --> 08:13.772
Ex-girlfriends... but, yeah,
I knew you were bad news, Theo.

08:13.802 --> 08:15.310
Look, guys, it's not personal.

08:15.340 --> 08:16.711
That juice truck was a drug front.

08:16.741 --> 08:18.574
The ashcrofts are criminals.
Karma might be too.

08:18.626 --> 08:20.231
Hey, hey, hey. It's not worth it.

08:20.261 --> 08:22.679
You want to end up in jail
with the rest of them?

08:23.392 --> 08:24.982
Hey, Theo.

08:27.885 --> 08:29.223
(Bleep).

08:29.253 --> 08:31.170
Oh, that hurts.

08:31.255 --> 08:34.256
(Melancholy music)

08:34.308 --> 08:38.427
♪ ♪

08:38.866 --> 08:40.284
Lauren.

08:45.118 --> 08:47.585
I have to say, I saw a lot
of amateur art today,

08:47.615 --> 08:49.071
and yours was the most amateur.

08:49.101 --> 08:50.472
There's something really
important I have to do,

08:50.502 --> 08:51.741
so could you reject me another time?

08:51.771 --> 08:54.999
- You got the fellowship.
- Are you messing with me?

08:55.029 --> 08:57.779
I see potential in you.
You're angsty and emotional,

08:57.809 --> 08:59.448
and you can use it in your art.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.117
Fellowship's yours if you still
want to spend the semester away.

09:02.202 --> 09:04.620
I absolutely still want to get away.

09:04.705 --> 09:05.937
Great.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.074

09:19.019 --> 09:21.519
So who'd you bribe to get
all those signatures?

09:21.605 --> 09:24.294
Shane, you're obviously going
to beat me in this election,

09:24.324 --> 09:26.742
which I'm only doing to stop
thinking about my boyfriend,

09:26.772 --> 09:28.432
who apparently is a narc,

09:28.462 --> 09:30.484
which means our whole
relationship was a lie.

09:30.514 --> 09:32.214
I'm humiliated and confused.

09:32.266 --> 09:34.238
And not in the mood for your crap.

09:34.268 --> 09:35.856
Lauren, wait.

09:35.886 --> 09:37.085
Would it make you feel any better to know

09:37.115 --> 09:40.020
I've been humiliated too?

09:41.772 --> 09:42.772
Yeah.

09:43.610 --> 09:45.849
Duke and I broke up because
he wouldn't come out,

09:45.879 --> 09:50.584
and the next day, he's
out with his beard.

09:50.614 --> 09:52.474
Is that Taffie from biggest loser?

09:52.504 --> 09:53.402
Yup.

09:53.432 --> 09:55.743
If you're gonna date reality,
at least go with a winner.

09:55.773 --> 09:57.912
- Taffie came in third.
- That poor girl.

09:57.942 --> 10:00.559
That poor girl? What about me?

10:00.611 --> 10:02.232
You always knew who Duke was.

10:02.262 --> 10:04.401
That poor girl has no
idea who she's dating.

10:04.431 --> 10:06.398
He's been lying to her about everything.

10:06.433 --> 10:10.386
- Is Duke even his real name?
- Actually, it's Shannon.

10:10.416 --> 10:13.243
She has no idea that he
is a big liar and a fake.

10:13.273 --> 10:16.847
Taffie deserves to know the truth,

10:16.877 --> 10:18.168
and so do I.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.347
She's right.

10:22.532 --> 10:26.451
Taffie does deserve to know the truth.

10:28.322 --> 10:30.906
Karma, I got arrested so we could talk.

10:30.941 --> 10:32.458
Just hear me out.

10:32.488 --> 10:34.682
Come on, mom, it smells
like traitor over here.

10:34.712 --> 10:36.128
It's just the toilet.

10:36.490 --> 10:38.464
What'd you do to your hand?

10:38.949 --> 10:41.488
- Punched a cop in the face.
- Attagirl.

10:41.518 --> 10:42.785
Let me see it. My cousin's a doctor.

10:42.815 --> 10:45.671
Honey, don't you think
you're being a little harsh.

10:46.206 --> 10:48.896
"A little harsh"... "A little harsh"?

10:48.926 --> 10:51.093
I just think you should
give her a chance to explain.

10:51.123 --> 10:52.845
Oh, okay.

10:52.930 --> 10:55.419
Amy, please explain to me

10:55.449 --> 10:57.821
how you could have sex with my boyfriend.

10:57.851 --> 11:00.386
And then lie to my
face about it for weeks.

11:00.416 --> 11:03.644
Amy, you had sex with a boy?

11:03.674 --> 11:06.530
Focus on the crushing betrayal.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.279
You did the one thing you
knew I could never forgive.

11:10.309 --> 11:12.602
You left me no choice but to hate you,

11:12.632 --> 11:14.382
and I hate you for that.

11:14.418 --> 11:16.551
Karma, I'm so sorry. I...

11:19.959 --> 11:23.697
Okay, you don't have to hate me.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

11:23.727 --> 11:25.177
Like she's gonna believe anything

11:25.207 --> 11:28.013
that comes out of your slutty mouth.

11:28.602 --> 11:29.436
No.

11:29.466 --> 11:32.434
I want to hear how sleeping
with the boyfriend

11:32.469 --> 11:35.328
of your best friend in the entire world.

11:35.358 --> 11:37.778
Is not as bad as it sounds.

11:37.808 --> 11:40.058
But when you're done,
if I'm not convinced,

11:40.110 --> 11:42.416
you have to transfer schools,
because I never want to see

11:42.446 --> 11:45.197
your (bleep) face ever again.

11:45.249 --> 11:46.749
You have 60 seconds.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.175
You're on.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.681
Just to be clear, I'm not
interested in Liam.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.500
I only slept with him
because I wanted to hurt you

11:59.552 --> 12:00.991
in the worst way possible.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.720
Not a great opening.

12:03.106 --> 12:05.398
Hope you're not representing
yourself in court.

12:05.428 --> 12:06.207
(Sighs)

12:06.237 --> 12:08.448
Remember when you saved up all your money

12:08.478 --> 12:10.633
to buy that cinderella dress
and you kept it in my room.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.052
So that your mom wouldn't see it?

12:12.082 --> 12:13.301
Karma.

12:14.114 --> 12:17.841
Wow, I'm really screwing this up.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.155
My point is, you were always fantasizing

12:21.191 --> 12:23.157
about meeting your prince charming.

12:23.193 --> 12:26.661
I was happy just to share
a cardboard castle with you,

12:26.696 --> 12:28.329
and it wasn't until we kissed in the gym

12:28.364 --> 12:30.120
that I realized why.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.502
I've been in love with you
since the day we met,

12:34.537 --> 12:37.588
and suddenly we were
pretending to be a couple,

12:37.618 --> 12:40.864
and there was hand-holding
and kissing and threesomes.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.194
I started to have hope,

12:43.229 --> 12:46.448
hope that you were realizing
your prince charming

12:46.478 --> 12:50.456
was princess sarcasm.

12:53.491 --> 12:57.097
But when that hope died, my heart broke,

12:57.127 --> 12:59.127
and I was hurt and angry,

12:59.179 --> 13:01.629
and I just wanted to cause you pain.

13:02.029 --> 13:03.903
And then I got drunk, and Liam was there

13:03.933 --> 13:07.453
like a human sledgehammer.

13:08.390 --> 13:09.426
And then I sobered up,

13:09.456 --> 13:12.802
and I knew I made the
biggest mistake of my life.

13:13.109 --> 13:14.525
And I knew that if you found out,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.086
this would happen.

13:16.829 --> 13:22.250
Not the jail part, the you-hating-me part.

13:27.529 --> 13:29.162
- Time's up.
- Screw the time.

13:29.192 --> 13:31.097
You said that we can
get through anything.

13:31.127 --> 13:35.129
Please just give me a chance
to earn your trust back.

13:42.984 --> 13:44.368
This is it.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.624
This is where you decide whether or not

13:46.659 --> 13:48.915
I'll be in your life anymore.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.638
Wait.

13:59.317 --> 14:00.677
That's a big thing you're asking for.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.757
- I'll need something in return.
- Of course you do.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.064
After this, you're done
with the art nonsense.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.483
You'll start an internship
at skwerkel instead.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.846
Once you get your MBA,

14:08.898 --> 14:10.681
you'll take a management
position in the company.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.073
You may even take over one day.

14:18.858 --> 14:23.694
If you back out, you're cut off for good.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.419
I can't believe they dropped the charges.

14:31.449 --> 14:34.922
Now, this just goes to show you
the power of positive thinking.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.208
The guard said that someone
we know called in a favor

14:37.293 --> 14:38.376
to the Attorney General.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.677
But he's a republican.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.796
We don't know any Republicans.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.420
We'll go get the juice truck.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.585
You know Liam did this, right?

14:47.620 --> 14:49.370
I know.

14:53.209 --> 14:56.460
Do you want this back?

14:58.483 --> 15:01.106
But I'm not ready to wear it yet.

15:01.136 --> 15:02.700
Oh.

15:07.123 --> 15:07.972
It's Friday night.

15:08.002 --> 15:09.891
Don't you have plans with Reagan?

15:10.476 --> 15:13.861
- We were gonna go camping.
- Go.

15:13.947 --> 15:17.448
- You're more important.
- I know.

15:17.866 --> 15:20.985
But I'll be here when you get back.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.928
- I love you.
- I love you too.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.386
You did well your first case.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.370
Now that we know you can handle it,

15:39.400 --> 15:40.872
we'll send you to tougher schools.

15:40.902 --> 15:42.624
You start Baldwin High on Monday.
