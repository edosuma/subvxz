WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:17.143
[panting]

00:17.268 --> 00:19.228
Stop. We can't leave without her.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.239
[indistinct chatter]

00:56.182 --> 00:57.349
[door closes]

01:00.644 --> 01:01.687
-[girl whimpers]
-[man grunts]

01:01.854 --> 01:02.730
[girl] Run!

01:03.981 --> 01:04.982
Run!

01:06.400 --> 01:07.318
Let me go.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.153
Let me go!

01:11.906 --> 01:14.116
[bell tolling]

01:25.085 --> 01:27.004
-You okay, Patron?
-Hmm.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.218
[Gamache] What sort of God allows such
atrocities to happen in his name?

01:34.136 --> 01:35.763
What sort of man allows it?

01:38.933 --> 01:41.977
This tiny, sleepy village, full of kind,

01:42.061 --> 01:45.189
compassionate people,
and two murders in one year.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.358
Yeah.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.570
Perhaps some of that evil
from St. Anthony's leached into the ground

01:51.654 --> 01:54.490
and ran into Three Pines
and polluted the place.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.576
It's all connected.

02:01.038 --> 02:01.956
Come on.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.046
[opening theme music playing]

02:37.908 --> 02:40.327
What was your relationship
with Marc Fortier?

02:42.413 --> 02:46.125
-We were just acquaintances.
-Oh, come on now, Peter.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.043
We know it was more than that.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.717
When you erase something on your cell,
it's not really, uh...

02:54.800 --> 02:56.719
it's not really gone, okay?

02:57.636 --> 03:01.348
We can access the data,
every text, every picture you ever sent.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.938
We have your text conversations
with Marc Fortier right here.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.024
[Gamache] You met Marc quite a lot.

03:10.399 --> 03:14.904
And judging from these texts,
your relationship was, um...

03:15.821 --> 03:17.031
intense.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.828
"It's been years since I felt like this,
light and free.

03:22.912 --> 03:25.706
But it only lasts
minutes after I leave you,

03:25.789 --> 03:27.458
and then I feel bad again."

03:28.375 --> 03:29.877
"You have to tell Clara."

03:29.960 --> 03:33.088
"I know. But every time I try, I bail."

03:33.672 --> 03:36.383
-"Can I see you tonight?"
-Stop, please.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.177
It looks bad, I see that.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.138
But it's not at all how it sounds.
I swear to God, it's not.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.183
You wouldn't be the first married man
to have an affair with a man.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.810
-It wasn't an affair.
-[Beauvoir] So what was it?

03:46.894 --> 03:50.230
You were looking for something
in the cabin. What was it?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.024
Marc's laptop.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.985
[Peter sighs]

03:55.569 --> 03:58.280
What was on the laptop
that you wanted to hide?

03:59.490 --> 04:00.532
My therapy notes.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.745
I gave Marc art lessons,
he gave me therapy.

04:06.789 --> 04:08.707
Why would you wanna hide that?

04:08.791 --> 04:11.126
Because I know what you do
when someone dies.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.923
I don't want anyone reading those notes.
They're private.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.719
If you read them, you'll know.

04:20.803 --> 04:23.347
-Know what, Peter?
-Who killed Marc?

04:24.765 --> 04:25.849
No. [scoffs]

04:29.979 --> 04:35.192
Things that happened a long time ago.
Things I've never shared with Clara.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.285
[door opens and closes]

04:50.541 --> 04:54.461
I'm sorry, I... I should have asked first.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.923
It's just a sketch.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.553
When can I see Peter?

05:02.928 --> 05:05.097
Where were you when Marc cried out?

05:05.639 --> 05:10.310
I don't know, on the ground floor
somewhere trying to get out.

05:10.394 --> 05:14.148
You didn't seem as impressed
with Marc as your friends were.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.191
What was it about him?

05:17.234 --> 05:18.610
He asked me to paint him.

05:18.694 --> 05:19.862
Oh.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.574
-And did you?
-No. I don't do commissions.

05:24.575 --> 05:30.122
I choose my subjects
because I see something inside them.

05:30.914 --> 05:31.915
Something...

05:32.499 --> 05:37.713
unresolved that maybe
they don't even see inside themselves.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.136
And you didn't see anything inside Marc?

05:44.219 --> 05:46.305
Nothing I wanted to paint.

05:46.388 --> 05:51.018
Were you threatened by him?
By his friendship with Peter?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.436
No. Why would I be?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.022
Well, we know they spent
a lot of time together.

05:55.105 --> 05:59.234
-Perhaps that bothered you.
-I wasn't exactly thrilled about it.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.946
Peter was with him all the time.
It didn't make any sense to me.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.408
But do you really think
I'm capable of murder?

06:06.492 --> 06:08.077
Well, I think we all are.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.537
I'm gonna need a DNA sample.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.973
You've reached the voicemail of
Chief Inspector Armand Gamache.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.642
Please leave a message.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.187
[Lacoste] I'm going to have another look
at Kevin and Tommy's house.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.980
I must have missed something.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.660
[sighs]

07:16.979 --> 07:18.772
[panting]

08:03.442 --> 08:05.110
Oh, my God.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.835
[grunts]

08:21.919 --> 08:23.295
[duck quacks]

08:24.880 --> 08:26.298
[quacking]

08:27.299 --> 08:28.759
[Gamache] Ground's a little hard.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.677
You need some help?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.097
[chuckles]

08:41.897 --> 08:43.023
What are you digging?

08:59.581 --> 09:01.458
I called her Lillium.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.129
I only cracked the shell to help her.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.032
[woman] Here. Take care of it.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.015
It's not your fault, Ruth.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.643
Nature's way.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.313
They can't all survive.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.461
"Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul,

10:27.544 --> 10:31.465
and sings the tune without the words
and never stops at all."

10:32.924 --> 10:35.719
-Yeah, yeah. Emily Dickinson.
-[chuckles softly]

10:36.136 --> 10:37.888
How fucking boring.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.765
[laughs]

10:40.432 --> 10:43.810
Well, she was a favourite of mine,
until I read Ruth Zardo.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.567
Heard you got Peter
in a cell up in Montreal.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.568
Not anymore.

10:52.277 --> 10:56.031
-What were you doing in their home?
-Clara's helping with inquiries.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.991
They've got nothing to do with it.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.537
-Well, you have proof of that?
-I know what I know.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.373
Could be one of them.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.461
Instead of hypothesizing, numb-nuts,

11:09.544 --> 11:12.422
why don't you go find
some actual evidence?

11:16.885 --> 11:18.011
[chuckles softly]

11:23.600 --> 11:25.143
[chuckles]

11:28.438 --> 11:30.107
[in French] Okay. Get that bagged.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.221
[Lacoste] Is it blood?

12:01.972 --> 12:03.765
[in French] We'll have it processed
right away.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.417
Can I help you?

12:32.085 --> 12:36.089
Hi, Kathleen Barker.
Department of Youth Protection.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.257
What's this about?

12:38.216 --> 12:41.845
-I need to speak to you about your girls.
-Is everything okay?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.723
-Can we go inside?
-Yeah.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.646
[Kathleen] There's been allegations
about your parenting.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.151
Allegations of what?

12:57.235 --> 12:59.362
I'm not at liberty to say.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.408
We've been told you work long hours.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.161
You know, I'm a police officer.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.914
And sometimes the girls are left alone.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.665
No.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.542
Never.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.504
They're with my mother when I'm working.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.381
They're always safe.

13:21.009 --> 13:25.680
-You can't take them away from me.
-This is just an investigation.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.433
The complaint was made
to the Childhelp hotline,

13:28.517 --> 13:31.186
and we have to investigate
every complaint.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.231
The call was anonymous?

13:34.648 --> 13:35.982
Hmm.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.284
This is crazy.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.619
[exhales]

13:48.662 --> 13:51.289
Sometimes people make
malicious allegations.

13:51.957 --> 13:55.877
But we have to take
every call we get seriously,

13:55.961 --> 13:56.962
you know that.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.690
Marc's laptop's been processed. Nothing.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.858
Just as well, I got something.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.945
I took it upon myself to have
a little looksie at the cell phone

14:22.028 --> 14:24.239
the kid left at the school the night of.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.949
You wanna see what I found?

14:30.662 --> 14:32.998
-You ready? Yeah?
-[Gamache] Mm-hmm.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.542
[indistinct shouting on video]

14:40.005 --> 14:41.756
[Nichol] Hey, look, it's Sophie.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.053
Sophie was there.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.181
Do you think she could've been there
without Hayden knowing?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.851
Or maybe he didn't want us
thinking his little genius

14:52.934 --> 14:54.936
was vandalizing empty properties.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.148
Okay, are you ready for this?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.816
[Gamache] Mm-hmm.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.240
Okay, look to the right of the screen.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.701
-It's Bea.
-Bea told me she wasn't there.

15:09.784 --> 15:10.952
So she lied.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.579
[Gamache] Question is, why.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.456
Good work.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.833
I'm impressed.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.631
[exhales]

15:38.021 --> 15:39.939
Why'd you lie to me, Bea?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.359
You were there at St. Anthony's.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.943
Why'd you lie about that?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.113
I've got my reasons.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.911
-None of them are any of your concern.
-Well, I am concerned.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.623
Do you think I'm dangerous, Chief?
You think I'm a killer?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.168
Go ahead, arrest me.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.130
No?

16:05.757 --> 16:06.841
I didn't think so.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.016
[engine starts]

16:48.508 --> 16:50.969
Matthew, Bea's brother.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.556
-Bea's brother?
-Mm-hmm.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.974
[Gamache] She never mentioned a brother.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.977
Matthew and a couple of boys
ran away from the school.

16:59.060 --> 17:02.480
They tried to cross
the Bella Bella and drowned.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.566
Their bodies were never recovered.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.610
And that this is a list of all the kids

17:07.694 --> 17:11.489
who went to St. Anthony's from the time
Bea was there until it closed.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.908
Figured this one might interest you.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.289
-Mary Two-Rivers?
-Yeah, the birth dates line up.

17:19.372 --> 17:24.169
I think Mary is the name the nuns gave
Arisawe Two-Rivers, a Christian name.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.587
Maybe she can help us.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.589
-Good work, Jean-Guy.
-Thank you.

17:28.214 --> 17:32.218
Cowansville are understaffed
so we're guarding the crime scene tonight.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.219
Okay.

17:39.184 --> 17:42.353
The SIJ found blood
up at Kevin and Tommy's house.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.397
They're testing it against Blue's DNA.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.649
The floor had been bleached down,

17:46.733 --> 17:50.320
so they took some samples
from between the boards,

17:50.403 --> 17:54.282
mostly just dirt and hair
and a few other fibres.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.911
-Pine needles?
-Isabelle, are you okay?

17:59.871 --> 18:02.290
Somebody called Youth Protection on me.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.336
-What?
-Yeah. I...

18:07.086 --> 18:12.175
I've social workers crawling around,
calling me... Calling me a bad mom.

18:13.510 --> 18:17.639
-If they were to take them from me...
-No, no, that's not gonna happen.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.974
No one's taking your kids anywhere.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.437
-We'll figure this out together, okay?
-Thanks.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.484
I need to go and speak to Arisawe.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.029
She was a pupil at St. Anthony's.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.030
Isabelle...

18:34.781 --> 18:38.284
Do you feel up to going
back out there with me tomorrow?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.287
Yeah, yeah, of course.

18:41.704 --> 18:42.914
Good.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.167
[bell rings]

18:58.763 --> 19:00.306
I have your therapy notes.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.272
You read them?

19:07.981 --> 19:10.692
Just enough to know
you were telling the truth.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.194
I deleted them from Marc's laptop.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.824
No one need know,
unless you choose to tell them.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.041
Secrets like this, Peter,
they're not good for the soul.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.544
Or for a marriage.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.806
[doorbell chimes]

19:48.271 --> 19:49.439
[sighs]

19:59.157 --> 20:02.160
Hayden must have known
Sophie was there that night.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.038
So he lied to us.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.834
Uh, you do what you gotta do
to protect your kids.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.673
Hey.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.217
You okay? What's up?

20:18.593 --> 20:20.470
[clanging]

20:21.179 --> 20:23.973
-What was that?
-It's coming from the basement.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.684
Are you insane?

20:26.768 --> 20:29.395
We're here to protect the scene,
aren't we?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.486
[Beauvoir]
Hey, I don't think this is a good idea.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.742
[Beauvoir shudders]

20:47.538 --> 20:48.498
[clattering]

20:48.581 --> 20:50.750
Police! Show yourself.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.669
[metal clangs]

20:52.752 --> 20:53.836
[Beauvoir] Police!

20:54.337 --> 20:56.506
Hey, maybe I should call for back-up.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.548
Come on.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.181
[rattling]

21:14.148 --> 21:16.150
[both breathing heavily]

21:16.609 --> 21:18.152
-[chittering]
-[both gasping]

21:18.236 --> 21:19.779
Fucking racoon!

21:19.862 --> 21:22.240
[both laughing]

21:25.034 --> 21:27.286
Okay. Come on, let's get out of here.

21:27.704 --> 21:28.997
Where'd it go?

21:29.080 --> 21:31.082
-Where'd it go?
-I don't care. Let's get outta here.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.625
-[rattling]
-Hear that?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.385
What is it?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.054
I don't know.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.391
But it's big enough to crawl through.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.810
Speak for yourself,
I'm too built for that.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.020
Oh... Sure you are.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.315
[Beauvoir] Hey.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.069
Okay.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.940
[door creaks]

22:45.698 --> 22:46.783
[screams]

22:47.158 --> 22:49.035
[laughs]

22:49.869 --> 22:50.787
Jesus.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.038
[laughs]

22:52.121 --> 22:55.625
Oh, God! You didn't think
I'd stay down there all by myself?

22:58.211 --> 22:59.712
It's a secret passageway.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.757
Well, if the killer
knew about this tunnel,

23:02.840 --> 23:05.885
he could've joined the others
without them noticing.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.346
Yeah, and stashed this along the way.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.726
It's the same make and model
as Marc Fortier's missing phone.

23:13.810 --> 23:14.852
Okay.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.376
Some good news would go
a long way right now.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.170
Find anything at Kevin's?

23:41.712 --> 23:44.382
We're still waiting
on the forensics report.

23:44.841 --> 23:48.469
Kevin's our best lead.
Looks like he's crossed the border.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.805
He could be anywhere right now.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.558
So you came all this way
to tell us nothing?

23:54.600 --> 23:55.434
No.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.147
They came all this way
so you could tell them something.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.323
Sorry.

24:12.618 --> 24:13.452
For what?

24:18.249 --> 24:19.167
Kara?

24:22.503 --> 24:25.506
I made that stupid call
to the child helpline, okay?

24:25.590 --> 24:28.759
What? Why would you...

24:29.385 --> 24:31.512
Why would you do something like that?

24:32.180 --> 24:34.223
I wanted you to know how it feels.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.267
To miss someone you love.

24:38.603 --> 24:41.981
Thought it might make you
do something to find my sister.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.399
Go get the tea.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.068
Go on.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.909
We have called them back
and sorted it all out.

24:53.618 --> 24:55.578
I'm truly sorry for what she did.

25:00.291 --> 25:04.295
We're actually here to ask
if you could help us with another case.

25:05.838 --> 25:06.756
What is it?

25:08.799 --> 25:12.303
We have a case at
the old residential school in Three Pines.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.057
We saw your name on the enrolment list.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.895
Would you be willing to answer
some questions about that time?

25:23.439 --> 25:25.274
Haven't you caused enough pain?

25:26.567 --> 25:27.568
[in French] Grandma.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.280
You don't have to go back there.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.531
I'm okay.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.083
Go on.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.795
When you were at the school,

25:46.879 --> 25:51.217
did you hear about three boys who escaped?
Ran away?

25:52.385 --> 25:55.096
And... they drowned.

25:58.683 --> 25:59.934
Yeah.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.272
And I know what really happened
to them, too.

26:05.356 --> 26:06.983
They didn't drown?

26:12.863 --> 26:14.490
A day before they ran away,

26:15.533 --> 26:18.995
one of the boys set fire
to the janitor's office.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.666
That man was pure evil.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.754
We called him the Caretaker.
Ironic and all.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.424
We were all shit scared of him.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.842
But he was mad as hell.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.136
He was planning their punishment.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.596
So they... The boys ran away.

26:39.765 --> 26:45.771
Somehow, he found out that
they were gone, and he went after them.

26:46.981 --> 26:51.319
Next day, we all heard
that they drowned in the Bella Bella.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.281
But we didn't believe them.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.619
What do you think really happened?

27:01.037 --> 27:02.163
Me?

27:02.246 --> 27:03.080
[gasps]

27:03.164 --> 27:03.998
[sighs]

27:08.210 --> 27:12.673
I think they're still down there.
They're down there in that basement.

29:23.304 --> 29:24.722
[sobbing]

29:31.937 --> 29:33.647
[sighs]

29:50.414 --> 29:53.417
If there's three, there's more.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.837
Possibly a lot more.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.965
We need ground radar up here.

30:00.674 --> 30:01.967
Cover the whole site.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.306
-[Lacoste] Do you think we can get DNA?
-I hope so.

30:13.521 --> 30:14.396
Isabelle.

30:19.068 --> 30:20.027
I'm sorry.

30:27.743 --> 30:28.786
I'm sorry, too.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.635
At least they get to go home.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.288
Bea.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.460
Spit it out, Chief, what?

31:20.796 --> 31:22.715
I think I found your brother.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.721
[women singing in foreign language]

32:38.999 --> 32:40.292
I'm so sorry.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.890
[sobbing]

33:09.863 --> 33:11.782
His name was Niyaaniipuu.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.245
Means "stands facing forward."

33:21.125 --> 33:23.836
Well, now that it's out,
what do you want to hear?

33:24.253 --> 33:26.255
It was my fault he died.

33:27.548 --> 33:28.841
How was it your fault?

33:29.383 --> 33:32.553
That's how they knew he was gone.
'Cause I got caught.

33:33.846 --> 33:37.224
You think Marc's father
killed your brother, don't you?

33:37.725 --> 33:39.393
I know he did.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.230
I heard him screaming,
and I heard him stop.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.447
It couldn't have been easy.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.408
Seeing Marc around Three Pines,

33:54.491 --> 33:56.535
reminding you what his father did.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.328
I didn't kill him, Chief.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.708
Do you have any idea who did?

34:02.791 --> 34:05.294
Maybe it's something, maybe it's nothing.

34:06.837 --> 34:07.755
What?

34:10.299 --> 34:12.092
-[Bea sighs]
-Tell me, Bea.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.888
The morning he died,

34:15.971 --> 34:18.974
I saw Marc and Sophie talking.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.350
But Hayden came along.

34:20.434 --> 34:24.229
They all started arguing,
and it was really tense.

34:31.028 --> 34:33.030
[piano playing]

35:12.277 --> 35:13.654
[piano stops]

35:13.737 --> 35:15.155
It was Marc's favourite.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.784
Well, it's just us now.

35:21.829 --> 35:22.871
[sniffles]

35:22.996 --> 35:26.959
That detective came around again.
Asked for you to call him.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.467
I'm going to the store to get a soda.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.302
-No.
-I know how to get there.

35:37.386 --> 35:40.430
You know how to get to St. Anthony's too,
don't you?

35:43.100 --> 35:44.434
I know you were there.

35:45.561 --> 35:49.565
I lied. I lied to the police
to protect you, Sophie.

35:51.275 --> 35:53.235
All this sneaking around,

35:53.777 --> 35:56.738
jeopardizing everything
we've dreamed about.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.534
What did you do?

36:02.286 --> 36:04.413
-I just needed some air.
-Sophie...

36:04.496 --> 36:05.998
Just needed some...

36:06.290 --> 36:08.709
God, some fucking space!

36:10.335 --> 36:12.337
[door opens and closes]

36:13.130 --> 36:15.841
[song in foreign language playing]

37:27.663 --> 37:29.915
[both chuckle]

37:33.251 --> 37:35.712
[indistinct chatter on TV]

37:37.673 --> 37:39.257
You see Mommy?

38:02.781 --> 38:05.117
[bird caws]

38:19.172 --> 38:21.258
[bird cawing]

38:28.557 --> 38:29.725
I love you.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.060
I love you, too.

38:45.699 --> 38:46.616
[Lacoste] Patron.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.203
The full analysis of Marc's
financial records came back.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.621
They found something?

38:52.039 --> 38:56.251
Well, he was living rent-free
because Hayden thought he was broke.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.588
It turns out he had over 100K
stashed in his bank account.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.549
So, he's capable of deceiving
his best friend.

39:02.632 --> 39:06.386
That's not it. He bought a plane ticket
to New York in Sophie's name.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.055
Team, I've got something.

39:08.138 --> 39:11.892
We found dozens of voice notes
from Marc's cell phone to Sophie's,

39:11.975 --> 39:13.268
and from hers to his.

39:13.351 --> 39:17.647
-They were having an affair?
-Well, maybe listen before you presume.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.153
Okay, one second.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.698
[Marc] So, great news.

39:26.782 --> 39:29.159
Got a call from NYU
and they're offering you

39:29.242 --> 39:32.412
a full scholarship
on the BA in Music Technology.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.748
I know this is what you want, Soph...

39:34.915 --> 39:38.251
But your dad loves you.
He just wants what's best for you.

39:39.252 --> 39:41.671
I hate keeping secrets
from my best friend.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.134
If you won't do it, Sophie, I will.

39:46.968 --> 39:50.138
Sophie was going to New York
to get away from her dad?

39:50.222 --> 39:51.723
And to study Music Tech.

39:51.807 --> 39:54.810
Schulich was Hayden's dream.
I guess it wasn't Sophie's.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.230
Marc was helping her achieve that
behind Hayden's back.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.816
[Gamache] But Marc was about
to expose Sophie's secret,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.485
which means they both had reasons
to be angry.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.903
Angry enough to kill?

40:04.986 --> 40:07.989
There's only one person
who can tell us that.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.225
Door's open.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.520
[Nichol] Police!

40:46.528 --> 40:47.445
They're gone.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.740
Put out an APB. Get SIJ down here.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.455
I've already found us a great apartment.

40:57.539 --> 40:58.707
We'll be roommates.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.542
I can help you with your practice

41:00.625 --> 41:05.297
and without the commute, there'll be
plenty of time for theatre, concerts.

41:05.839 --> 41:10.802
Isn't part of being a student
getting out into the world on your own?

41:11.678 --> 41:14.514
That's never going to be
an option for you, honey.

41:15.056 --> 41:19.269
There are people with my condition
who live totally normal lives.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.104
They go to school, to work.

41:21.188 --> 41:22.397
There's this one guy,

41:22.480 --> 41:25.734
he has these special glasses
with telescopes for driving...

41:25.859 --> 41:27.652
Who told you that? Marc?

41:29.446 --> 41:32.991
[Sophie] Marc cared about me,
about what I wanted.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.581
Dad, I... I think you missed the turn.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.128
We're not going to Montreal, are we?

41:46.755 --> 41:48.632
[siren wailing]

41:49.549 --> 41:50.926
Is that the police?

41:53.136 --> 41:55.096
Why aren't you stopping?

41:56.264 --> 41:57.265
What's wrong?

42:00.018 --> 42:01.561
Dad, you have to stop.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.233
God, you're scaring me!

42:07.442 --> 42:08.276
Copy.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.237
-Hayden's car was spotted.
-Hold on.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.780
-Let's go.
-I'll wait for SIJ.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.697
Good.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.415
[Hayden] Were you sleeping with him?

42:22.499 --> 42:25.627
[Sophie] What, no.
How could you even think that?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.045
[Hayden] He was filling your head

42:27.128 --> 42:30.548
with all that nonsense about New York
and music technologies,

42:30.632 --> 42:33.301
as if the talent you were born with
didn't matter.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.345
You think New York was Marc's idea?

42:35.428 --> 42:36.429
-Yes.
-It was mine.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.183
I begged him to help me,
begged him to keep it a secret.

42:40.267 --> 42:45.188
I was sick of living in that prison,
sick of being with you.

42:47.274 --> 42:49.150
[brakes screeching]

42:51.444 --> 42:52.654
-[gasping]
-[bear growls]

43:05.333 --> 43:08.044
[in French]
Christ, we didn't see that in Nicolet!

43:08.586 --> 43:11.548
[Gamache]
Nichol, keep your gun on the bear.

43:13.008 --> 43:14.050
Okay.

43:14.718 --> 43:16.678
We didn't know what to do, Chief.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.222
Stand down, officers. We've got this.

43:20.724 --> 43:22.142
Move back, it's okay.

43:26.646 --> 43:29.607
It's okay, it's all right, it's okay.
Just don't move.

43:29.691 --> 43:32.902
Hayden, you need to get out of the car.

43:34.571 --> 43:37.490
-I got the bear covered, sir.
-[Gamache] Hayden.

43:37.574 --> 43:38.950
[Hayden] It's okay. I'm so sorry.

43:39.034 --> 43:41.369
[Gamache] We need to get you both
away from the bear.

43:41.494 --> 43:43.663
-What did you do?
-I didn't do anything.

43:43.747 --> 43:46.166
You have to let Sophie out of the car.

43:48.209 --> 43:53.006
I know you want to protect her,
but you have to let her out of the car.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.050
[car door opens]

43:55.133 --> 43:56.384
Nice and slow.

43:58.053 --> 44:00.889
-[Hayden] Don't leave, Soph.
-[Gamache] No sudden moves.

44:00.972 --> 44:01.890
[Hayden] Please.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.101
[Gamache]
That's it, Sophie, nice and slow.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.020
Come towards us.

44:08.229 --> 44:09.939
That's right, nice and slow.

44:13.318 --> 44:14.235
[Lacoste] I'm right here.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.074
[Sophie crying]

44:19.157 --> 44:21.576
Now, Hayden,
you have to get out of the car.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.543
[growling]

44:30.627 --> 44:32.337
[Gamache] Show me your hands,
your hands!

44:37.634 --> 44:38.760
That's it.

44:39.552 --> 44:40.887
Slow.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.347
Agent Nichol.

44:45.183 --> 44:46.601
Put your hands behind you.

44:50.146 --> 44:53.108
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Marc Fortier.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.235
You need not say anything.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.112
You have nothing to hope for.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.738
No promise or favor.

44:58.822 --> 45:00.865
Nothing to fear from any threat.

45:29.894 --> 45:33.940
It was dark.
It was an accident, it was a mistake.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.860
Marc's injuries tell a different story.

45:37.193 --> 45:40.613
You smashed his skull against that rock
until he was dead.

45:41.364 --> 45:44.617
-That's a lot of anger.
-My little girl was in danger.

45:44.826 --> 45:48.580
-I have to keep her safe.
-Sophie's not a little girl anymore.

45:48.997 --> 45:52.959
[shouting] You have no idea
how dangerous it is out there,

45:53.042 --> 45:54.335
I'm her father!

45:57.630 --> 46:00.633
Perhaps she needs you
to let her make her own choices.

46:08.391 --> 46:10.435
Chief, how did you know?

46:11.519 --> 46:12.896
I called Richard Lyons.

46:12.979 --> 46:15.482
-But...
-Hayden was giving free piano lessons

46:15.565 --> 46:19.527
-up at St. Anthony's. He knew the house.
-But, what made you call, sir?

46:20.737 --> 46:24.824
If you go near a nest of chicks,
the mummy bird will freak out.

46:25.533 --> 46:28.661
She'll do anything to scare any intruders.

46:30.205 --> 46:31.122
Anything.

46:49.682 --> 46:51.559
I just got a call from SIJ.

46:51.643 --> 46:53.853
The blood at Kevin's
is a match for Blue's.

46:53.937 --> 46:55.605
Do they think she died there?

46:55.688 --> 46:59.359
I am waiting for the full report,
but it's looking bad for Kevin.

46:59.442 --> 47:00.985
We need to find him fast.

47:01.945 --> 47:05.573
[in French] Incident at
the old residential school in Three Pines.

47:05.657 --> 47:06.908
Nearby units please respond.

47:06.991 --> 47:07.909
Let's go.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.536
[in French] Copy. Heading to scene.

47:19.420 --> 47:21.214
[people shouting]

47:44.779 --> 47:46.781
[overlapping chatter]
