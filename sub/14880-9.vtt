00:02.297 --> 00:04.030
- What's going on, Jai?
- Come with me.

00:04.033 --> 00:06.333
Okay, I didn't want
a tuna melt anyway.

00:08.070 --> 00:09.636
- You're being reassigned.
- Who are you?

00:09.638 --> 00:11.271
I'm Lena Smith.
I'm your new boss.

00:11.273 --> 00:13.106
I think you are
being underutilized.

00:13.108 --> 00:16.175
I want you to do high security
clearance on Simon Fischer.

00:16.178 --> 00:17.844
- I need a sweep drive.
- Head to the Merrakech Souk.

00:17.846 --> 00:19.413
Simon has a computer tablet

00:19.415 --> 00:21.348
that I think
I can gain access to.

00:21.350 --> 00:22.916
He's in love with you.

00:22.918 --> 00:24.484
- Where are you going?
- Cuba.

00:24.486 --> 00:25.986
The mission to Cuba--

00:25.988 --> 00:27.354
I can't use
my regular passport.

00:27.356 --> 00:28.822
I know a guy.

00:28.824 --> 00:30.090
No one here will know
she left the country.

00:30.092 --> 00:31.391
You match the stamps?

00:31.393 --> 00:33.293
And the crease
on the Morocco page.

00:33.295 --> 00:34.394
Good luck.

00:34.396 --> 00:37.064
Auggie, I'm coming in.

00:37.066 --> 00:39.833
We can go in together.

01:57.311 --> 02:00.247
Anybody home?

02:18.766 --> 02:23.737
Excuse me, you just
passed the hospital.

02:23.739 --> 02:26.773
Isn't that where
you're supposed to take me?

02:29.377 --> 02:31.044
I think I'm dying.

02:31.046 --> 02:33.180
Those aren't
my instructions.

02:33.182 --> 02:35.782
You don't need a doctor.

02:35.784 --> 02:39.586
What you need
is a nice cup of tea.

02:46.761 --> 02:51.264
Besides, you look
the picture of health to me.

02:51.266 --> 02:53.266
How

02:55.870 --> 02:57.237
what is this?

02:57.239 --> 02:59.906
Questions only
lead to answers.

02:59.908 --> 03:03.376
Where's the fun in that?

03:04.846 --> 03:06.646
Left para-sternal GSW,
two entry wounds.

03:06.648 --> 03:08.715
She's pulseless.
Distended neck veins as well.

03:08.717 --> 03:10.183
Time of injury
is about ten minutes ago.

03:10.185 --> 03:11.384
Get two wide bore IVs.

03:11.386 --> 03:12.619
Let the blood bank know
we're gonna need

03:12.621 --> 03:13.853
a lot of O-neg.

03:13.855 --> 03:15.322
Get the open
chest tray ready.

03:15.324 --> 03:16.122
Call the O.R., let them know
we might be sending them

03:16.124 --> 03:17.557
a GSW heart.

03:17.559 --> 03:19.893
Open the chest,
let's see what we can do.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.361
Come on, young lady,
come back to us.

I'm Annie Walker's
emergency contact.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.391
I got a call
that she was here,

04:01.393 --> 04:03.059
but nobody will tell me
what's going on.

04:03.061 --> 04:04.027
Is she okay?

04:04.029 --> 04:06.195
Come with me.

04:21.612 --> 04:24.781
Mr. Anderson?
I'm Dr. Lerman.

04:24.783 --> 04:26.482
Oh, hey, how is she?

04:26.484 --> 04:30.153
Annie sustained two
gun shot wounds to the chest.

04:30.155 --> 04:32.322
The second bullet pierced
her left ventricle.

04:32.324 --> 04:33.556
We opened her chest
in the E.R.

04:33.558 --> 04:35.525
And we revived
her heart.

04:35.527 --> 04:37.160
We're bringing her
into the O.R. right now

04:37.162 --> 04:38.361
to try and repair the wound,

04:38.363 --> 04:41.698
but it's a very
delicate surgery.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.766
Is she gonna be okay?

04:43.768 --> 04:48.037
We'll know more
in a few hours.

04:48.039 --> 04:51.808
Thank you, Doctor.

05:15.099 --> 05:18.401
Hello, Annie.

05:18.403 --> 05:19.902
How did you--did you--

05:19.904 --> 05:22.805
Tea?

05:22.807 --> 05:24.707
No, thanks.

05:28.813 --> 05:31.614
- One lump or two?
- Really, I'm fine.

05:31.616 --> 05:33.049
Right.

05:33.051 --> 05:36.319
Sweet enough as you are.

05:36.321 --> 05:39.389
Mmm, that's lovely.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.430
Now then, you're
in great danger.

05:47.432 --> 05:50.767
From who?

05:54.004 --> 05:55.471
Blackbird.

05:55.473 --> 05:58.307
You need
to find Blackbird.

05:58.309 --> 06:01.110
And when I do?

06:06.016 --> 06:07.717
I see.

06:07.719 --> 06:09.719
I'm afraid we won't be
seeing each other again

06:09.721 --> 06:11.821
after this.

06:18.062 --> 06:20.430
I actually thought
it would be easier this time.

06:20.432 --> 06:21.898
What?

06:21.900 --> 06:24.934
Walking away from you.

06:24.936 --> 06:26.869
I'm sorry for everything.

06:26.871 --> 06:29.105
I'm not.

06:51.562 --> 06:56.365
I didn't want
a tuna melt anyway.

07:59.597 --> 08:03.766
What happened?

08:05.603 --> 08:07.870
Thank you all for coming in
on such short notice.

08:07.872 --> 08:09.472
We'd like to get you all
up to speed on the events

08:09.474 --> 08:12.241
that have transpired
in the last 24 hours.

08:12.243 --> 08:14.577
Earlier, Lena Smith presented me
with compelling evidence

08:14.579 --> 08:17.980
that Annie Walker has
been passing classified intel

08:17.982 --> 08:20.983
to an FSB operative
named Simon Fischer,

08:20.985 --> 08:23.553
who was also her lover.

08:23.555 --> 08:26.055
A few hours ago, they were
found shot in her kitchen.

08:26.057 --> 08:27.423
Now, we're laboring
under the theory

08:27.425 --> 08:30.293
that there was a dispute
over the escape plan.

08:30.295 --> 08:33.563
Simon fired first.
Annie shot back, killing him.

08:33.565 --> 08:37.700
She survived.
She's still in surgery.

08:37.702 --> 08:39.969
As Lena is the most
familiar with the evidence,

08:39.971 --> 08:42.471
she'll be briefing you
on the specifics.

08:42.472 --> 08:46.142
Lena.

08:46.144 --> 08:47.977
You all should have
a dossier in front of you.

08:47.979 --> 08:50.780
Please open
to the first page.

08:50.782 --> 08:55.117
You'll find an account Annie
held in an offshore bank.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.720
The account number was found
on the wallet that was on her

08:57.722 --> 09:01.390
when she was shot.

09:01.392 --> 09:03.793
Annie received regular deposits
in this account.

09:03.795 --> 09:06.562
Each in the amount
of $10,000 U.S.

09:06.564 --> 09:09.532
Turn to the next page, please.

09:09.534 --> 09:11.033
You're looking
at the flight plan

09:11.035 --> 09:13.703
for Simon Fischer's
private plane.

09:13.705 --> 09:18.474
Departed D.C., stopped in Mexico
and ultimately Cuba.

09:18.476 --> 09:20.943
Annie bought a forged passport
from an off-book cobbler

09:20.945 --> 09:23.679
in order to travel
with Simon.

09:23.681 --> 09:26.148
The next page is a list
of classified documents

09:26.150 --> 09:29.218
Annie provided
to Simon Fischer.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.954
Although it's still unknown
how she secreted these documents

09:31.956 --> 09:33.823
out of Langley,

09:33.825 --> 09:35.591
or where she obtained
the sweep drive,

09:35.593 --> 09:37.560
which we found
hidden in her home.

09:37.562 --> 09:39.595
Evidence on the drive
suggests she used it

09:39.597 --> 09:43.132
to pass the documents
to Simon digitally.

09:43.134 --> 09:46.035
Annie engaged Simon Fischer
under my purview.

09:46.037 --> 09:49.605
I should've
discovered it sooner.

09:49.607 --> 09:51.073
But Annie was
plucked from the farm

09:51.075 --> 09:55.344
before she finished training
and was put into the field.

09:55.346 --> 09:56.879
We are rushing people through,

09:56.881 --> 09:58.281
trying to put boots
on the ground

09:58.283 --> 10:00.583
instead of doing
our due diligence.

10:00.585 --> 10:02.151
And now because of that,
we're all here

10:02.153 --> 10:05.688
in the middle of the night,
dealing with the consequences.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.842
Hey, man.

10:26.844 --> 10:29.812
Coffee.

10:29.814 --> 10:31.948
- Thanks.
- No problem.

10:31.950 --> 10:34.583
How's she doing?
Still in surgery.

10:34.585 --> 10:36.919
Jeez.
What happened?

10:36.921 --> 10:38.788
I mean...

10:38.790 --> 10:42.558
Was she in some kind
of trouble or something?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.493
Well, considering
she was shot,

10:44.495 --> 10:47.530
I'd say yeah, she was
in some kind of trouble.

10:47.532 --> 10:50.232
Right, sorry.

10:50.234 --> 10:55.104
So, you must be the last
person to talk to her, huh?

10:55.106 --> 10:57.206
I don't know.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.641
The hospital called
about 30 minutes after

10:58.643 --> 11:01.577
I got off the phone
with her, so...

11:04.214 --> 11:07.249
How did you know
she called me?

11:07.251 --> 11:12.221
Ahh, the DCS requisitioned
a recording of it.

11:12.223 --> 11:15.691
I pulled the drive
for him myself.

11:15.693 --> 11:19.628
Requisitioned?
For what?

11:27.637 --> 11:29.805
Has anyone called
her sister, Danielle?

11:29.807 --> 11:31.407
No, not yet.

11:31.409 --> 11:32.541
We can't notify the family

11:32.543 --> 11:36.912
until we...
clarify a few things.

11:36.914 --> 11:39.415
Well, when the time comes,
I'm making the call.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.716
- Auggie--
- I'm doing it.

11:40.718 --> 11:41.951
It should come
from someone who's not

11:41.953 --> 11:44.487
trying to prosecute
her sister.

11:44.489 --> 11:46.555
It's been
a long night, Auggie.

11:46.557 --> 11:48.024
I haven't slept much either.

11:48.026 --> 11:49.392
I've been at the hospital
waiting for a doctor

11:49.394 --> 11:53.229
to pull a bullet
out of my friend.

11:53.231 --> 11:54.597
You didn't come here
to give me an update

11:54.599 --> 11:58.501
on Annie's condition,
did you?

11:58.503 --> 12:01.337
Word is, Annie's
being accused of treason.

12:01.339 --> 12:04.707
Tell me that's not true.

12:04.709 --> 12:07.109
This is bullshit!

12:07.111 --> 12:10.146
- Hey!
- This is bullshit, sir.

12:10.148 --> 12:11.881
There is no way
that could be true.

12:11.883 --> 12:13.482
What proof do you have?
I wanna see it.

12:13.484 --> 12:15.151
The evidence is above
your clearance, Auggie.

12:18.789 --> 12:21.791
Annie Walker
is no traitor.

12:21.793 --> 12:25.995
I don't care what evidence
you have, it's wrong.

12:25.997 --> 12:28.664
I'm gonna do whatever
I have to do to prove it.

12:37.911 --> 12:41.379
I'd like access to
the evidence against Annie.

12:41.381 --> 12:42.680
Please.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.148
I don't have the authority
to grant it.

12:44.229 --> 12:45.728
And I'm guessing
you're here because you've

12:45.730 --> 12:47.263
already been denied
by the person who does.

12:47.265 --> 12:48.965
I have been here long enough
to know what happens

12:48.967 --> 12:51.034
when even the hint
of an accusation like this

12:51.036 --> 12:52.402
gets hurled at an operative.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.037
Annie is on an island
right now.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.739
Auggie, I know how
difficult this is for you,

12:56.741 --> 12:58.608
and I'm having
a hard time with it myself.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.276
It all seems impossible.

13:00.278 --> 13:03.780
But the evidence that Lena
presented is--it's compelling.

13:05.649 --> 13:07.317
You actually
believe she's guilty?

13:07.319 --> 13:09.586
I don't know
what I believe.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.287
That's because
I can't be objective

13:11.289 --> 13:12.689
and neither can you.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.458
So what good is looking
at the evidence gonna do her...

13:15.460 --> 13:16.759
or you?

13:16.761 --> 13:18.328
No, you're right,
I'm not objective.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.430
So screw Lena's evidence,
I'll go out and find my own.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.999
Because whatever she has
that paints Annie as a traitor

13:23.001 --> 13:24.667
isn't worth the paper
that it's printed on.

13:24.669 --> 13:27.003
Okay, you see,
this is exactly why

13:27.005 --> 13:29.105
people without
an emotional stake in Annie,

13:29.107 --> 13:32.542
I.E. not you or I,
are vetting everything.

13:32.544 --> 13:37.213
That includes having
Lena herself polygraphed.

13:43.488 --> 13:44.721
Oh, hey.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.623
Hey, Lieber, I need
you to do me a solid.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.924
Oh, name it.

13:47.926 --> 13:50.160
- I wanna sit in.
- No, no.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.629
A solid is a ride to the airport
or telling your wife

13:52.631 --> 13:54.130
you were with me
when you weren't.

13:54.132 --> 13:55.532
What you just asked for is
neither of those things.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.767
I don't have a wife.

13:57.769 --> 13:59.068
I'll be quiet
as a mouse.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.370
No one will ever
know I was here.

14:00.372 --> 14:03.806
I can't.

14:03.808 --> 14:06.776
You still want a transfer
to U.K. desk, right?

14:06.778 --> 14:08.211
Yeah.

14:08.213 --> 14:10.146
I got a buddy over there,
he's an analyst.

14:10.148 --> 14:11.614
He's transferring
to Berlin station

14:11.616 --> 14:13.049
at the end of the month.

14:13.051 --> 14:15.351
I can set you up with
an interview with Andrew Branch

14:15.353 --> 14:17.554
before anyone else knows
that job is available.

14:20.824 --> 14:22.926
You're quieter than
a mouse, you understand?

14:22.928 --> 14:27.130
You're a dead mouse.

14:27.132 --> 14:31.201
Not a single squeak.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.237
Were you assigned
an operative named Annie Walker?

14:34.239 --> 14:35.705
Yes.

14:35.707 --> 14:37.540
And did she initially
exhibit any behaviors

14:37.542 --> 14:40.043
which you found
to be suspect?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.644
No.

14:41.646 --> 14:45.348
Did Annie propose the mission
to cultivate Simon Fisher?

14:45.350 --> 14:47.050
Yes.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.785
Did you agree
to this mission?

14:48.787 --> 14:50.687
Yes.

14:50.689 --> 14:54.657
Were you aware Annie and Simon
were romantically involved?

14:54.659 --> 14:56.025
No, I wasn't.

14:56.027 --> 14:58.695
All right, what's the verdict?
Fact or fiction?

14:58.697 --> 15:00.396
So far she's
telling the truth.

15:00.398 --> 15:02.498
This is a waste
of time.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.400
Anybody with Lena's background
would have no problem

15:04.402 --> 15:05.635
beating a polygraph.

15:05.637 --> 15:06.869
You know, for a dead mouse,

15:06.871 --> 15:08.071
you do an awful lot
of squeaking.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.305
Do you think Annie
had any involvement

15:09.307 --> 15:14.143
in the death
of Jai Wilcox?

15:14.145 --> 15:16.179
I don't know.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.348
Yes or no, please.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.851
If those are my only options,
I'm gonna have to say yes.

15:25.623 --> 15:28.057
Were you aware of Annie's
plans to go to Cuba?

15:34.865 --> 15:36.499
Did Annie notify you--

15:36.501 --> 15:38.134
I know that you're
an exemplary operative

15:38.136 --> 15:39.402
and you've done
a lot of great things

15:39.404 --> 15:40.470
for this agency--

15:40.472 --> 15:41.738
Hey.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.106
But if you believe
that Annie could kill anyone

15:43.108 --> 15:44.941
in cold blood, let alone
someone she cared for,

15:44.943 --> 15:46.809
you don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

15:46.811 --> 15:49.479
- I am so sorry about this--
- this is outrageous.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.714
Who's your supervisor?
It's okay, Leo.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.250
I understand why your anger
is directed at me, Auggie.

15:54.252 --> 15:56.886
But this is an inappropriate way
to deal with it.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.454
We're all frustrated here.

15:58.456 --> 16:01.858
- I know.
- Let's go.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.031
Are you out of your mind?

16:13.804 --> 16:15.505
I understand.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.308
Give me an hour
to gather the materials.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.277
Yes, sir.

16:25.549 --> 16:30.320
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.455
The DCI's assembling
a small committee to determine

16:32.457 --> 16:36.225
whether or not Annie
should be decommissioned.

16:36.227 --> 16:38.995
I have to brief them
in 30 minutes.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.930
But it hasn't
even been 24 hours.

16:40.932 --> 16:42.699
This seems like
a rush to judgment.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.133
Well, the last six months

16:44.135 --> 16:45.568
have hardly been stellar
for this agency,

16:45.570 --> 16:47.170
between Jai murdered
on U.S. soil

16:47.172 --> 16:49.238
and now a possible traitor
in our midst.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.575
DCI's being squeezed
from all sides for answers.

16:52.577 --> 16:54.510
So the only way
to relieve the pressure

16:54.512 --> 16:56.779
is to sew this up
as soon as possible.

16:56.781 --> 16:58.047
But how can they
decide anything

16:58.049 --> 16:59.482
until Annie wakes up?

16:59.484 --> 17:01.384
She should have the right
to defend herself.

17:01.386 --> 17:02.885
I spoke to Annie's doctor.

17:02.887 --> 17:05.054
She's stable, but
there is no telling when,

17:05.056 --> 17:07.723
or even if she'll
regain consciousness.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.561
Thanks.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.268
- Annie Walker's friend, right?
- Yeah.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.636
What do you need?

17:20.637 --> 17:22.538
I'm here to pick up
her personal effects.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.406
A gentleman already
collected them earlier.

17:24.409 --> 17:25.875
He had a warrant.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.710
Gotta get me
one of those.

17:27.712 --> 17:29.212
Did she have
something you needed?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.481
Well, that's what
I was hoping to find out.

17:31.483 --> 17:34.150
There's an itemized list
of her belongings in her chart.

17:34.152 --> 17:36.085
I can make a copy
of it for you.

17:36.087 --> 17:38.154
I'd love that,
yeah, thanks.

17:38.156 --> 17:40.056
Okay.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.291
It should take
a few minutes.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.095
I said it'll
just take a few minutes.

17:46.097 --> 17:47.230
Please, have a seat.

17:48.666 --> 17:51.367
Danielle.
What are you doing here?

17:51.369 --> 17:54.103
I'm here to conduct
a polygraph examination...

17:54.105 --> 17:56.239
on you.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.807
Okay.

17:57.809 --> 18:00.042
This isn't really
a good time.

18:00.044 --> 18:01.244
Funny how it's
never a good time

18:01.246 --> 18:03.246
when I need
something from you.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.551
Let's do it.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.635
Is your name
Anne Catherine Walker?

18:25.637 --> 18:26.836
Yes.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.806
Do you reside
in Washington, D.C.?

18:29.808 --> 18:31.741
Georgetown, yes.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.342
Did you like
the miso black cod

18:33.344 --> 18:35.878
I made for
your birthday last year?

18:35.880 --> 18:39.649
- What?
- You barely touched it.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.851
You claimed you had
a really big lunch that day.

18:41.853 --> 18:44.187
Did you like my cod?

18:46.623 --> 18:48.791
Yes.

18:48.793 --> 18:51.461
Come on, Danielle.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.663
Do you ever intend to keep

18:53.665 --> 18:55.364
the promises you make,
or do you know they're empty

18:55.366 --> 18:58.134
when you make them?

18:58.136 --> 18:59.669
What?

18:59.671 --> 19:01.604
I didn't
compose the questions,

19:01.606 --> 19:03.606
I'm just here
to conduct the interview.

19:03.608 --> 19:05.908
Please answer the question.

19:05.910 --> 19:08.478
I intend to keep
every promise I make.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.314
I'm not lying.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.982
Well, the machine
indicates otherwise.

19:12.984 --> 19:15.785
And frankly, I'm more inclined
to trust an electronic device

19:15.787 --> 19:17.687
than you.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.289
You know what? This is over.

19:20.291 --> 19:22.358
Did you ever consider
what effects joining the C.I.A.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.827
would have on your family?

19:24.829 --> 19:26.429
Were you aware
of the potential dangers

19:26.431 --> 19:29.031
and chose to join regardless?

19:29.033 --> 19:33.636
Nothing was ever more
important to me than you.

19:36.441 --> 19:40.276
I don't know where
your allegiance lies.

19:40.278 --> 19:42.678
But your actions
suggest it isn't with me.

20:01.598 --> 20:04.100
Hey, good-looking,
need a ride?

20:16.346 --> 20:18.147
Would you mind
reading this to me?

20:18.149 --> 20:20.616
I left my reading glasses
in my car.

20:20.618 --> 20:23.085
Of course, sorry.

20:23.087 --> 20:24.787
Uh, let's see...

20:24.789 --> 20:29.559
pants, shoes, blouse, earrings,
wallet, U.S. passport--

20:29.561 --> 20:31.827
Passport? Why would
she be carrying that?

20:31.829 --> 20:33.262
Maybe she was
on her way out of town?

20:33.264 --> 20:36.999
No, she she was
on her way to see me.

20:37.001 --> 20:38.935
You wouldn't happen to have
the number of that passport

20:38.937 --> 20:40.369
on that list, would you?

20:40.371 --> 20:41.737
I do.

20:41.739 --> 20:43.472
Barber, I need you
to run a passport.

20:43.474 --> 20:45.041
I want to know
if it's real or a forgery.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.042
Yeah, hit me.

20:46.044 --> 20:50.112
Bravo, 9-2-8-3-7-4-6-8.

20:50.114 --> 20:52.481
No, it wasn't issued by State.
It's definitely a forgery.

20:52.483 --> 20:53.716
One of ours?

20:56.354 --> 20:57.920
Nope, CIA
didn't make it either.

20:57.922 --> 20:59.855
Must've been created
by an off-book cobbler.

20:59.857 --> 21:01.724
Outstanding.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.926
Annie copping
a bogus passport is good news?

21:03.928 --> 21:05.695
The best news
I've had all day.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.196
And I need you
to get me the addresses

21:07.198 --> 21:09.298
of the best cobblers
in the area.

21:09.300 --> 21:12.802
I'm gonna make
a few house calls.

21:18.809 --> 21:20.810
Mr. Guerrero?

21:24.781 --> 21:26.849
Hello?

21:32.623 --> 21:35.024
Hello?

21:35.026 --> 21:38.427
Hello?

21:38.429 --> 21:41.297
Mr. Guerrero?

22:40.790 --> 22:42.723
Clear! Clear!

22:46.594 --> 22:48.629
- Anything?
- The place is clear.

22:48.631 --> 22:50.698
He must've snuck out
while I called for back-up.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.834
I heard a car on the street
about two minutes after I left.

22:53.836 --> 22:55.335
Diesel, I think.

22:55.337 --> 22:57.004
What do you wanna bet that
was the killer's getaway car?

22:57.006 --> 22:59.615
Killer?

23:01.944 --> 23:04.945
This wasn't here before.

23:04.947 --> 23:06.613
I may be blind,
but I know the difference

23:06.615 --> 23:08.716
between a cheap rug
and a dead body.

23:08.718 --> 23:11.418
All right, so what
do you imagine happened here?

23:11.420 --> 23:15.456
I don't know.

23:21.997 --> 23:25.299
Do you see any flowers
or scented candles around?

23:30.071 --> 23:32.473
No, I don't see
anything like that.

23:32.475 --> 23:36.009
I could've sworn
I smelled lavender earlier.

23:36.011 --> 23:38.412
All right,
I'm taking you home.

23:38.414 --> 23:39.947
You need sleep.

23:39.949 --> 23:41.415
How much sleep
do you think I'm gonna get

23:41.417 --> 23:43.851
knowing some committee's trying
to burn Annie at the stake?

23:43.853 --> 23:45.319
It's nothing personal,
Auggie,

23:45.321 --> 23:47.621
they're gonna make a decision
based on the evidence.

23:47.623 --> 23:49.189
All they're looking for
is evidence to indict,

23:49.191 --> 23:50.991
that's all they're gonna find.

23:50.993 --> 23:53.527
You gotta help me convince
Arthur to give me those files.

23:53.529 --> 23:55.129
Somebody's gotta
fight for Annie.

23:55.131 --> 23:57.865
I agree, which is why
I've been sifting through

23:57.867 --> 23:59.800
every scrap of evidence,

23:59.802 --> 24:02.503
looking for anything
I can to help Annie.

24:02.505 --> 24:05.806
I care about her too, Auggie.

24:05.808 --> 24:09.676
Do you trust me
to fight for her?

24:09.678 --> 24:12.346
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:12.348 --> 24:13.714
Let me take you home.

24:13.716 --> 24:15.249
- I wanna go to the hospital.
- Auggie.

24:15.251 --> 24:17.451
I can get a cab.

24:20.488 --> 24:24.391
Come on,
I'll drive you.

24:35.237 --> 24:37.571
Yeah?

24:37.573 --> 24:38.839
Oh, thank you.

25:00.161 --> 25:01.762
What is it?

25:01.764 --> 25:03.831
Well, it's not official yet.

25:03.833 --> 25:06.200
But I wanted you
to hear it from me.

25:06.202 --> 25:09.336
The committee decided
to decommission Annie.

25:11.739 --> 25:14.975
Auggie was right.

25:14.977 --> 25:16.643
DCI's not interested
in due process.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.312
He just wants to assign blame
and move on.

25:18.314 --> 25:19.413
Well the operatives
in this building

25:19.415 --> 25:22.783
depend on him
to protect them.

25:22.785 --> 25:25.886
When there's overwhelming
evidence that one among us

25:25.888 --> 25:27.154
is a traitor,

25:27.156 --> 25:29.723
he has no choice
but to act swiftly.

25:29.725 --> 25:32.025
Mm.

25:32.027 --> 25:36.263
Maybe Lena was right.

25:36.265 --> 25:38.165
Maybe we brought
Annie in too early.

25:38.167 --> 25:40.701
No, she was ready, Arthur.

25:40.703 --> 25:44.071
She had more raw talent
than anyone I have ever seen,

25:44.073 --> 25:46.406
and in the two-and-a-half years
that we've worked together,

25:46.408 --> 25:49.176
she's proved herself to be
an invaluable operative.

25:49.178 --> 25:51.144
Invaluable.

25:51.146 --> 25:53.680
Even if she was lying
to you the entire time?

26:00.355 --> 26:03.357
You have never doubted

26:03.359 --> 26:06.660
she was guilty, have you?

26:06.662 --> 26:10.564
You didn't even
try to defend her.

26:10.566 --> 26:13.200
So, what about the operative
that depends on you

26:13.202 --> 26:15.068
to have their back?

26:15.070 --> 26:18.205
Annie Walker...

26:18.207 --> 26:22.476
is looking very,
very guilty.

26:22.478 --> 26:26.179
It's hard to accept.

26:26.181 --> 26:29.283
I know.

26:43.932 --> 26:47.768
You should talk to her.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.703
Can she hear me?

26:49.705 --> 26:52.005
The truth is
nobody knows for sure.

26:52.007 --> 26:55.876
But I like
to think she can.

26:55.878 --> 26:58.478
There's some food
at the foot of the bed.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.948
You look like
you could use it.

27:00.950 --> 27:04.318
Thanks.

27:14.363 --> 27:16.596
Annie, hey,
it's me...

27:16.598 --> 27:19.566
Auggie.

27:19.568 --> 27:24.371
You know, the guy
that gave you a Corvette.

27:24.373 --> 27:26.206
Since I have
your undivided attention,

27:26.208 --> 27:29.376
I'd like to share
my thoughts about how

27:29.378 --> 27:32.846
Billy Collins' poetry
is overrated and derivative.

27:32.848 --> 27:35.382
If you agree with this,
say absolutely nothing.

27:40.689 --> 27:43.957
Yeah, the thing about this
whole witty banter deal is

27:43.959 --> 27:45.459
it kind of takes two people.

27:45.461 --> 27:47.694
Otherwise it's just
a guy by himself

27:47.696 --> 27:51.398
being incredibly clever.

27:56.571 --> 28:00.807
I miss you, Annie.

28:00.809 --> 28:04.011
I have for a long time.

28:05.747 --> 28:08.215
Things have been different
between us since Barcelona,

28:08.217 --> 28:10.784
and it's all my fault.

28:13.154 --> 28:17.157
I've been, uh...
closed off and distant,

28:17.159 --> 28:20.394
and...

28:20.396 --> 28:23.063
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for that.

28:26.267 --> 28:27.701
I don't know
if you can hear me,

28:27.703 --> 28:31.738
but I need you to wake up.

28:31.740 --> 28:33.774
I know you're not
a traitor and right now

28:33.776 --> 28:36.777
you're the only one
who can help me help you.

28:38.679 --> 28:43.383
I need you, Annie.

28:43.385 --> 28:48.155
I never need anyone.

28:48.157 --> 28:51.658
But I need you.

29:24.759 --> 29:28.161
We got intel that Blackbird
is staying in room 309.

29:28.163 --> 29:30.397
The only way to get up there
without being seen is to use

29:30.399 --> 29:32.632
the service elevator
in the kitchen.

29:32.634 --> 29:34.701
Sounds like a plan.

29:34.703 --> 29:38.138
How do I get
to the kitchen?

29:38.140 --> 29:41.041
Do you trust me?

29:41.043 --> 29:44.778
With my life.

30:00.261 --> 30:02.529
Have I ever told you
how beautiful you are?

30:02.531 --> 30:04.464
I clean up nicely,
don't I?

30:04.466 --> 30:07.734
I'm not talking
about the clothes.

30:35.263 --> 30:37.063
You should probably
get upstairs.

30:37.065 --> 30:38.832
The song's not over yet.

30:38.834 --> 30:40.400
We could dance
a little while longer.

30:40.402 --> 30:41.735
There's nothing
I'd like more,

30:41.737 --> 30:45.772
but you and I both know
this isn't our song.

30:45.774 --> 30:50.577
We'll dance again, Walker,
but not until the music's right.

30:50.579 --> 30:53.113
Until then...

30:53.115 --> 30:54.681
The access card
for the kitchen

30:54.683 --> 30:58.451
is in my right coat pocket.

31:01.189 --> 31:04.558
Let's do this.

31:28.983 --> 31:33.119
Hey, I thought
you could use that.

31:35.089 --> 31:37.457
Thanks.

31:37.459 --> 31:40.860
The nurse said she's almost
done changing Annie's bandages.

31:40.862 --> 31:43.797
It'll be about
five more minutes.

31:51.172 --> 31:52.772
Look, I just want you
to know what happened

31:52.774 --> 31:57.110
in polygraph yesterday
won't leave the polygraph room.

31:57.112 --> 32:00.213
I don't blame you for having
the reaction that you did.

32:03.918 --> 32:06.319
If there's anything
I can do for you--

32:06.321 --> 32:09.222
anything at all,
just ask.

32:12.627 --> 32:15.662
I'm here to help.

32:19.533 --> 32:21.134
Thanks for the coffee.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.656
It was Lena.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.892
When I found
Guerrero's body,

32:46.391 --> 32:48.958
I was positive that
I smelled lavender.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.261
By the time you got there,
it was gone.

32:51.263 --> 32:54.030
I just caught that scent
again at the hospital.

32:54.032 --> 32:57.033
It wasn't flowers,
it was Lena's perfume.

32:57.035 --> 32:59.069
Tom Ford, lavender palm.

32:59.071 --> 33:00.703
It couldn't
be a coincidence.

33:00.705 --> 33:02.272
She was in his house.

33:02.274 --> 33:04.007
Nobody dislikes Lena
more than I,

33:04.009 --> 33:07.477
but to accuse her of murder
based on the perfume she wears

33:07.479 --> 33:09.512
is tantamount
to career suicide.

33:09.514 --> 33:11.214
She was there,
Joan, I'm not crazy.

33:11.216 --> 33:12.415
I'm not saying you are.

33:12.417 --> 33:15.318
Just help me
connect the dots, okay?

33:15.320 --> 33:16.853
Um...

33:16.855 --> 33:21.091
why would Lena kill the cobbler
that forged Annie's passport?

33:21.093 --> 33:23.059
Maybe Annie
didn't buy the passport.

33:23.061 --> 33:24.427
Maybe Lena did.

33:24.429 --> 33:26.496
Well, why would
she do that?

33:26.498 --> 33:28.565
And why keep it off-book?

33:28.567 --> 33:31.634
Unless Lena was aiding
and abetting Annie.

33:31.636 --> 33:33.970
Maybe Lena's
the real FSB double

33:33.972 --> 33:35.305
and Annie is just her patsy.

33:35.307 --> 33:36.639
It makes sense
why she'd kill Guerrero.

33:36.641 --> 33:37.841
Think about it.

33:37.843 --> 33:39.275
As long as he's alive,
he can prove

33:39.277 --> 33:41.344
not only that Lena knew Annie
went to Cuba,

33:41.346 --> 33:43.279
but she helped her get there.

33:43.281 --> 33:44.747
And if anyone
finds that out,

33:44.749 --> 33:47.851
her entire cover
starts to unravel.

33:47.853 --> 33:50.053
It's a plausible theory,
but it's all conjecture.

33:50.055 --> 33:51.387
Can you prove any of it?

33:51.389 --> 33:53.890
- That's why I'm here.
- Oh, Auggie--

33:53.892 --> 33:56.059
I have gone as far
as I can on my own.

33:56.061 --> 33:58.928
I need access to that evidence
to get the rest of the way.

33:58.930 --> 34:01.764
And unless I get it,
you can expect my resignation.

34:07.338 --> 34:09.739
Because this is
a time of extreme duress,

34:09.741 --> 34:12.876
I'm going to pretend
you didn't just demand

34:12.878 --> 34:16.012
I violate a dozen protocols
by passing you intel

34:16.014 --> 34:17.880
well above your clearance.

34:17.882 --> 34:20.150
But try this tack with me again
and I assure you,

34:20.152 --> 34:23.152
you will not enjoy
the consequences.

34:31.161 --> 34:35.899
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to call tech support.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.634
I'm having trouble accessing

34:37.636 --> 34:40.969
the evidence files
on the Manhattan server.

34:40.972 --> 34:44.641
I'll have to recite my access
code and under no circumstances

34:44.643 --> 34:46.275
can I have you overhear it.

34:46.277 --> 34:48.011
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

34:48.013 --> 34:50.380
I think I do.

34:50.382 --> 34:52.649
Good.

34:54.686 --> 34:56.886
It was at this time
Lena Smith terminated

34:56.888 --> 34:58.221
the mission to cultivate
Fischer because

34:58.223 --> 34:59.389
It failed to yield intel.

34:59.391 --> 35:00.456
Operative Walker
was remanded

35:00.458 --> 35:01.691
to the domestic
protection division.

35:01.693 --> 35:03.459
Unbeknownst to Smith,
operative Walker

35:03.461 --> 35:05.195
continued to pursue Fisher
of her own accord.

35:06.364 --> 35:07.897
Smith testified
to tasking operative Walker--

35:07.899 --> 35:14.938
a venture capitalist. She's
suspected of being an FSB agent.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.407
Smith provided evidenceink e
close to 5:00 pm.

35:17.409 --> 35:19.042
I saw the light on
in the kitchen

35:19.044 --> 35:20.310
and red Volkswagen
in the driveway,

35:20.312 --> 35:21.311
so I assumed
someone was home.

35:21.313 --> 35:22.278
But it was real quiet.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.513
Other than the bodies,

35:23.515 --> 35:24.514
I didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

35:24.516 --> 35:25.715
Just cars and houses.

35:25.717 --> 35:27.217
Same every other block
in the neighborhood.

35:27.219 --> 35:28.718
Other than the bodies,
I didn't see anything--

35:32.724 --> 35:33.823
See anything
out of the ordinary.

35:33.825 --> 35:35.291
Just cars and houses.

35:35.293 --> 35:37.794
Same as every other block
in the neighborhoo--

35:37.796 --> 35:39.329
other than the bodies,
I didn't see anything

35:39.331 --> 35:40.530
out of the ordinary,
just--

35:43.300 --> 35:46.135
Ordinary,
just cars and houses.

36:00.517 --> 36:02.018
DMV database.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.753
Registered to Lena Smith.

36:03.755 --> 36:07.123
Gray 2011 BMW X5 diesel.

36:07.125 --> 36:09.926
I didn't expect to see you
leaving here anytime soon.

36:09.928 --> 36:11.961
I think I found something.

36:11.963 --> 36:13.196
Then I'm coming with you.

36:13.198 --> 36:14.530
Good, you can drive.

36:14.532 --> 36:16.032
I think
I'd prefer that, actually.

36:16.034 --> 36:18.568
Where are we going?
To throw a hail Mary.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.321
Mr. Goodman?

36:38.323 --> 36:40.790
May we speak with you
for a moment?

36:40.792 --> 36:42.258
Are you guys cops
or something?

36:42.260 --> 36:43.760
We have a follow-up question

36:43.762 --> 36:46.229
about the statement
you gave the other night.

36:46.231 --> 36:47.797
Yeah, no problem.

36:47.799 --> 36:48.898
Shoot.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.033
On the night
you found the bodies,

36:50.035 --> 36:52.568
do you remember
seeing a gray BMW X5

36:52.570 --> 36:54.370
parked anywhere nearby?

36:54.372 --> 36:58.441
A gray BMW.

36:58.443 --> 37:01.844
Actually, you know what?
I do.

37:01.846 --> 37:03.313
You do?

37:03.315 --> 37:05.915
- Are you sure it was a BMW?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm positive.

37:05.917 --> 37:08.484
I'm in that neighborhood a lot
and I remember

37:08.486 --> 37:10.853
because it was parked
underneath the big tree

37:10.855 --> 37:13.289
where I always
park the truck.

37:13.291 --> 37:15.558
Gotta keep the cookies
in the shade, you know?

37:16.995 --> 37:18.428
The same color,
make and model car

37:18.430 --> 37:19.996
as the one registered to Lena
was parked less than a block

37:19.998 --> 37:22.131
from Annie's house
on the night she was shot.

37:22.133 --> 37:25.101
Well, I'm not sure
it's enough to implicate Lena.

37:25.103 --> 37:26.269
But I can make
a damn good case

37:26.271 --> 37:28.438
to postpone
decommissioning Annie

37:28.440 --> 37:30.173
until we can
look into this further.

37:32.177 --> 37:34.410
I have the hospital
on line one.

37:34.412 --> 37:37.580
Hello.

37:37.582 --> 37:39.615
I see.

37:39.617 --> 37:42.452
All right.
Thank you, Doctor.

37:43.455 --> 37:44.854
What is it?

37:44.856 --> 37:46.122
Annie woke up.

37:46.124 --> 37:47.890
Just for a few minutes,
but she was responsive.

37:47.892 --> 37:51.928
The doctor says
that's a really good sign.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.368
Look who's finally
come home to roost.

38:02.373 --> 38:06.909
You're Blackbird.
I should have known.

38:06.911 --> 38:09.612
Funny how each mirror makes
everything look so different.

38:22.227 --> 38:23.993
The entire time
you were looking for me,

38:23.995 --> 38:29.532
you should have been looking
in the mirror, Blackbird.

38:29.534 --> 38:31.367
You know who you are?

38:31.369 --> 38:34.036
Who you really are?

38:34.038 --> 38:35.405
Look into your heart.

38:35.407 --> 38:37.540
It's the only thing
that doesn't lie.

38:49.954 --> 38:50.953
Gotcha!

39:05.914 --> 39:07.014
What are you doing?

39:07.016 --> 39:08.982
CPR! Her heart stopped.

39:08.984 --> 39:11.685
Help me!

39:11.687 --> 39:13.320
Uhh! Uhh!

39:18.926 --> 39:19.960
Lena!

39:22.230 --> 39:23.864
We need some
help over here!

39:25.467 --> 39:28.168
Joan?

39:28.170 --> 39:29.936
No! No!

39:46.155 --> 39:48.922
Help!

41:04.765 --> 41:06.466
This is Joan Campbell.

41:06.468 --> 41:09.569
I want every possible way
out of DC sealed off.

41:09.571 --> 41:11.771
Train stations,
bus stations, airports.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.540
I want them
all shut down.
