00:44.739 --> 00:46.706
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE
YOU ALL VERY SAD...

00:46.708 --> 00:50.643
THE SCHOOL BOARD IS CONSIDERING
FIRING ME AS YOUR TEACHER.

00:50.645 --> 00:53.146
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT I WILL BE LET GO,

00:53.148 --> 00:55.715
AND NEVER ALLOWED
TO TEACH YOU AGAIN.

00:55.717 --> 00:57.150
YES, STANLY?

00:57.152 --> 00:58.418
THAT'S OKAY
WITH US.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.018
YEAH.

00:59.020 --> 01:00.720
NO, IT ISN'T,
IT MAKES YOU VERY SAD!!

01:00.722 --> 01:03.122
APPARENTLY THE SCHOOL BOARD
THINKS I DON'T TEACH YOU

01:03.124 --> 01:04.691
ANYTHING ABOUT
CURRENT EVENTS,

01:04.693 --> 01:07.227
SO TOMORROW THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE YOU DO PRESENTATIONS

01:07.229 --> 01:08.862
FOR THE WHOLE BOARD.

01:08.864 --> 01:09.829
( moaning )

01:09.831 --> 01:11.631
"CURRENT EVENTS
IN SOUTH PARK."

01:11.633 --> 01:13.533
NOW I WANT YOU ALL
TO READ A NEWSPAPER,

01:13.535 --> 01:14.667
OR BETTER YET
WATCH TELEVISION,

01:14.669 --> 01:17.403
AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING
CURRENT IN SOUTH PARK

01:17.405 --> 01:18.705
TO DO A REPORT ON.

01:18.707 --> 01:19.706
( moaning )

01:19.708 --> 01:20.874
NOW, THIS WILL BE
A GROUP PROJECT,

01:20.876 --> 01:23.209
SO I'M GONNA PLACE YOU
ALL INTO GROUPS OF FIVE.

01:23.211 --> 01:24.010
LET'S SEE...

01:24.012 --> 01:26.312
WENDY, BEBE, CLYDE,
PIP AND TOKEN,

01:26.314 --> 01:27.413
YOU'LL BE GROUP ONE.

01:27.415 --> 01:28.848
AND GROUP TWO
WILL BE...

01:28.850 --> 01:31.584
STAN, KYLE, ERIC,
KENNY, AND...

01:31.586 --> 01:34.020
AND...
TWEEK!

01:34.022 --> 01:34.821
AH!

01:34.823 --> 01:35.722
OH, NOT TWEEK!

01:35.724 --> 01:37.423
WE DON'T WANT TO BE
IN A GROUP WITH TWEEK!

01:37.425 --> 01:39.158
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH TWEEK.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.127
I BET HE'LL DO
A GREAT JOB IN YOUR GROUP.

01:41.129 --> 01:42.629
I CAN'T TAKE
THAT KIND OF PRESSURE!

01:42.631 --> 01:43.796
NO, SWEET JESUS,
PLEASE!

01:43.798 --> 01:45.565
DUDE, WE CAN'T WORK
WITH THIS KID.

01:45.567 --> 01:46.232
AGH!

01:46.234 --> 01:47.800
THAT'S WHAT CHAD EVERETT THOUGHT
WHEN THE NEW FEMALE INTERN

01:47.802 --> 01:49.135
JOINED THE CAST
OF "MEDICAL CENTER".

01:49.137 --> 01:52.171
HE THOUGHT, "WHO IS
THIS WOMAN WITH HER GAZUNGAS
AND HIGH HEELS?"

01:52.173 --> 01:53.439
"WHAT DOES SHE
KNOW OF MEDICINE?"

01:53.441 --> 01:55.708
WELL, THAT INTERN SOON SAVED
CHAD EVERETT'S BROTHER

01:55.710 --> 01:57.377
WITH A KIDNEY
TRANSPLANT.

01:57.379 --> 01:58.411
SO YOU SEE?

01:58.413 --> 01:59.412
NO.

01:59.414 --> 02:01.014
WELL, LET ME PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY...

02:01.016 --> 02:02.181
YOU HAVE TO GIVE
YOUR ORAL REPORT

02:02.183 --> 02:03.983
TO THE ENTIRE SOUTH PARK
TOWN COMMITTEE TOMORROW,

02:03.985 --> 02:06.552
AND IF IT DOESN'T KICK ASS,
AND YOU MAKE ME LOOK BAD,

02:06.554 --> 02:09.389
MR. HAT IS GONNA
SMACK YOU BITCHES UP.

02:09.391 --> 02:11.324
WAH!

02:16.298 --> 02:18.064
HELLO THERE,
CUSTOMER!

02:18.066 --> 02:19.265
HELLO,
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

02:19.267 --> 02:21.167
GREAT, WHAT CAN
I GET FOR YOU?

02:21.169 --> 02:22.402
LARGE COFFEE,
SMALL COFFEE?

02:22.404 --> 02:24.270
I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED
IN SOMETHING ELSE.

02:24.272 --> 02:26.639
I'M JOHN POSTUM FROM
THE HARBUCKS COFFEE CORPORATION.

02:26.641 --> 02:29.575
OH, YOU'RE THAT CORPORATE GUY
WHO'S BEEN CALLING.

02:29.577 --> 02:30.443
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:30.445 --> 02:32.679
HOW COME YOU DON'T
CALL ME BACK?

02:32.681 --> 02:35.715
ALL WE WANT TO DO IS BUY OUT
YOUR COFFEE SHOP HERE.

02:35.717 --> 02:37.650
FORGET IT, MY STORE
IS NOT FOR SALE.

02:37.652 --> 02:42.355
MY COMPANY IS PREPARED TO
MAKE YOU A VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

02:42.657 --> 02:46.025
THIS IS A<i> CRAMSONITE</i> BRIEFCASE,
ALL LEATHER,

02:46.027 --> 02:48.695
IT HAS FOUR COMPARTMENTS
AND A KEYLESS LOCK.

02:48.697 --> 02:49.562
INTERESTED?

02:49.564 --> 02:50.496
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:50.498 --> 02:51.698
MY COFFEE SHOP
IS WORTH A LOT TO ME.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.733
ALRIGHT, HOW ABOUT
500,000 DOLLARS?

02:53.735 --> 02:55.034
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO,
MR. POSTUM.

02:55.036 --> 02:58.204
YOU SEE, WHEN MY FATHER OPENED
THIS STORE 30 YEARS AGO,

02:58.206 --> 02:59.806
HE CARED ABOUT
ONLY ONE THING,

02:59.808 --> 03:01.441
MAKING A GREAT
CUP OF COFFEE.

03:01.443 --> 03:03.643
SURE, WE MAY TAKE A LITTLE
LONGER TO BREW A CUP,

03:03.645 --> 03:05.111
AND WE MAY NOT
CALL IT FANCY NAMES,

03:05.113 --> 03:07.013
BUT I GUESS WE JUST
CARE A LITTLE MORE.

03:07.015 --> 03:09.282
AND THAT'S WHY TWEEK COFFEE
IS STILL HOME-BREWED

03:09.284 --> 03:10.984
FROM THE FINEST BEANS
WE CAN MUSTER.

03:10.986 --> 03:13.619
YES, TWEEK COFFEE
IS A SIMPLER COFFEE...

03:13.621 --> 03:15.621
FOR A SIMPLER
AMERICA.

03:15.623 --> 03:16.923
WELL,
THAT'S TOO BAD.

03:16.925 --> 03:19.659
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
OPEN OUR HARBUCKS

03:19.661 --> 03:20.994
RIGHT NEXT DOOR
TO YOU.

03:20.996 --> 03:22.562
BUT, THAT COULD PUT ME
OUT OF BUSINESS!

03:22.564 --> 03:25.031
HEY, THIS IS
A CAPITALIST COUNTRY, PAL.

03:25.033 --> 03:27.166
GET USED TO IT.

03:27.435 --> 03:29.202
HELLO,
MR. TWEEK.

03:29.204 --> 03:30.570
HI, OFFICER BARBRADY.

03:30.572 --> 03:31.337
WHO WAS THAT?

03:31.339 --> 03:33.840
JUST SOME DONG.
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

03:33.842 --> 03:35.608
THE USUAL.

03:36.811 --> 03:37.343
OH!

03:37.345 --> 03:38.811
THANKS,
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

03:38.813 --> 03:40.646
BYE, BYE.

03:43.385 --> 03:46.052
OKAY, WE HAVE TO DO
THIS STUPID REPORT SO--

03:46.054 --> 03:46.953
AGH!

03:50.959 --> 03:53.893
SO LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO IT ABOUT.

03:54.596 --> 03:57.296
HOW ABOUT WE DO IT ON
THAT RAYMOND GUY ON TV.

03:57.298 --> 03:58.598
YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.299
NO, CARTMAN, WE CAN'T
DO IT ON RAYMOND AGAIN!

04:00.301 --> 04:02.235
IT HAS TO BE ON
A CURRENT EVENT IN SOUTH PARK.

04:02.237 --> 04:03.536
TWEEK, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEAS?

04:03.538 --> 04:04.871
AGH!
TOO MUCH PRESSURE!

04:04.873 --> 04:06.739
GREAT, A LOT OF HELP
YOU ARE, KID.

04:06.741 --> 04:07.740
THE GNOMES!

04:07.742 --> 04:08.374
WHAT?

04:08.376 --> 04:09.575
WE CAN DO OUR REPORT
ON THE GNOMES.

04:09.577 --> 04:10.410
WHAT GNOMES?

04:10.412 --> 04:11.344
THE UNDERPANTS
GNOMES!

04:11.346 --> 04:12.311
THOSE LITTLE
GUYS THAT...

04:12.313 --> 04:13.546
THAT COME IN YOUR ROOM
LATE, LATE AT NIGHT

04:13.548 --> 04:16.049
AND STEAL
YOUR UNDERPANTS!

04:16.151 --> 04:18.618
OH, SO THAT'S WHERE
ALL MY UNDERPANTS GO.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.186
DUDE, THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

04:20.188 --> 04:21.721
YEAH, I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANY UNDERPANTS GNOMES.

04:21.723 --> 04:23.423
THEY COME OUT AT
3:30 IN THE MORNING...

04:23.425 --> 04:25.224
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T
UP THEN, BUT I AM.

04:25.226 --> 04:26.392
I CAN'T SLEEP...
EVER.

04:26.394 --> 04:28.428
DUDE, WE CAN'T DO A PRESENTATION
ON UNDERPANTS GNOMES.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.296
MR. GARRISON WILL FAIL US
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.

04:30.298 --> 04:33.866
SLEEP AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT!
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU!

04:34.069 --> 04:35.935
THEY WANT ME
TO SELL THE STORE

04:35.937 --> 04:37.003
AND IT'S
SO MUCH MONEY.

04:37.005 --> 04:38.971
SOME THINGS ARE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY.

04:38.973 --> 04:40.706
THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH PARK
COUNT ON<i> YOU</i>

04:40.708 --> 04:43.076
TO GIVE THEM THAT FIRST
CUP OF COFFEE EVERY DAY.

04:43.078 --> 04:45.945
I KNOW, BUT IF THEY OPEN
A HARBUCKS RIGHT NEXT DOOR,

04:45.947 --> 04:47.146
WE MIGHT
GO OUT OF BUSINESS.

04:47.148 --> 04:49.582
THEY REALLY HAVE MY BALLS
IN A VICE GRIP.

04:49.584 --> 04:52.485
OH, HELLO, SON.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

04:52.487 --> 04:53.486
AAAAGAGGH!

04:53.488 --> 04:54.320
THAT'S GOOD.

04:54.322 --> 04:55.588
WHO ARE YOUR
LITTLE FRIENDS?

04:55.590 --> 04:56.522
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?!

04:56.524 --> 04:57.590
WE'RE HIS
ORAL REPORT BUDDIES.

04:57.592 --> 04:59.092
YEAH, WE HAVE TO STAY UP
ALL NIGHT TO WRITE IT.

04:59.094 --> 05:00.193
WELL, HAVE
SOME COFFEE BOYS.

05:00.195 --> 05:01.794
I'LL BREW UP
ANOTHER POT FOR LATER.

05:01.796 --> 05:03.329
COFFEE? I DON'T THINK
I LIKE COFFEE.

05:03.331 --> 05:06.232
OH, YOU'LL LIKE<i> THIS</i> COFFEE,
IT'S FRESH.

05:06.234 --> 05:07.100
COUNTRY FRESH,

05:07.102 --> 05:09.302
LIKE THE MORNING
AFTER A RAINSTORM.

05:09.304 --> 05:10.036
'KAY...

05:10.038 --> 05:11.637
MAYBE IT'LL HELP US FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO OUR REPORT ON.

05:11.639 --> 05:14.140
WE HAVE TO PRESENT IT
TO THE ENTIRE SOUTH PARK
TOWN COMMITTEE TOMORROW.

05:14.142 --> 05:15.741
OH, I'VE GOT
ONE FOR YOU.

05:15.743 --> 05:17.977
HOW ABOUT DOING A REPORT
ON HOW LARGE CORPORATIONS

05:17.979 --> 05:20.746
TAKE OVER LITTLE,
FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES?

05:20.748 --> 05:21.447
RICHARD!

05:21.449 --> 05:22.782
NO,
I'M SERIOUS, HON.

05:22.784 --> 05:25.418
THESE BOYS SHOULD LEARN
HOW THE CORPORATE MACHINE
IS RUINING AMERICA.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.819
YOU SEE,
I OWN A COFFEE SHOP,

05:26.821 --> 05:29.188
AND NOW A GREAT, BIG,
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR COMPANY

05:29.190 --> 05:31.724
IS GOING TO MOVE IN AND
TRY TO TAKE ALL MY BUSINESS.

05:31.726 --> 05:33.259
WHICH MEANS I MAY
HAVE TO SHUT DOWN,

05:33.261 --> 05:35.428
AND SELL MY SON TWEEK
INTO SLAVERY.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.662
AGH!
SLAVERY?

05:36.664 --> 05:37.663
YES, SLAVERY.

05:37.665 --> 05:38.564
WOW,
THAT SUCKS, DUDE.

05:38.566 --> 05:40.600
THEY REALLY HAVE MY BALLS
IN A SALAD SHOOTER.

05:40.602 --> 05:43.703
WE'RE ALREADY DOING A PAPER
ON TWEEK'S UNDERPANTS GNOMES.

05:43.705 --> 05:44.403
YEAH.

05:44.405 --> 05:46.072
NOW TWEEK, HOW MANY TIMES
DO WE HAVE TO TELL YOU?

05:46.074 --> 05:47.974
YOUR UNDERPANTS ARE MISSING
BECAUSE YOU LOSE THEM,

05:47.976 --> 05:50.376
NOT BECAUSE OF
UNDERPANTS GNOMES.

05:50.378 --> 05:51.077
AGHH!

05:51.079 --> 05:52.845
COME ON, YOU GUYS,
WE BETTER GET TO WORK!

05:52.847 --> 05:56.582
OKAY, BUT CORPORATE TAKEOVERS
IS A MUCH MORE FERTILE SUBJECT.

05:56.584 --> 05:57.483
HONESTLY,
RICHARD,

05:57.485 --> 05:59.986
I DON'T SEE WHY YOU HAVE TO
PREACH TO SOME EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS.

05:59.988 --> 06:00.853
ACTUALLY, HONEY,

06:00.855 --> 06:02.588
I THINK THOSE LITTLE TYKES
ARE JUST WHAT WE NEED...

06:02.590 --> 06:04.924
I'VE GOT
AN IDEA.

06:06.561 --> 06:08.261
MAN, THIS STUFF
IS STRONG.

06:08.263 --> 06:09.262
IT'S KIND
OF BITTER.

06:09.264 --> 06:11.097
WHAT IF MY PARENTS
GO OUT OF BUSINESS?

06:11.099 --> 06:11.931
WHAT'LL I DO?

06:11.933 --> 06:12.965
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.167
BUT WE'LL STARVE
AND DIE LIKE DOGS!

06:14.169 --> 06:15.868
TWEEK, TWEEK, YOU CAN
ALWAYS GO ON WELFARE.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.136
LOOK AT
KENNY'S FAMILY...

06:17.138 --> 06:19.972
THEY'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY
BEING POOR AND ON WELFARE,
RIGHT, KENNY?

06:19.974 --> 06:20.706
( mumbling )

06:20.708 --> 06:21.741
YOU SUCK,
KENNY!

06:21.743 --> 06:25.611
LET'S JUST TRY
TO FINISH ALL THIS COFFEE,
SO WE CAN STAY UP.

06:26.548 --> 06:27.413
WOO HOO!

06:27.415 --> 06:29.782
YES!
THIS STUFF ROCKS!

06:29.784 --> 06:32.385
TOTALLY DUDE!
I FEEL AWESOME!

06:32.387 --> 06:33.319
WHOOPEE!

06:33.321 --> 06:35.254
YOU GUYS,
YOU GUYS!

06:35.256 --> 06:36.923
SERIOUSLY!

06:36.925 --> 06:38.324
CHECK ME OUT!
I'M A SORCERER!

06:38.326 --> 06:39.692
CHECK IT OUT,
GUYS!

06:39.694 --> 06:41.761
HEY, TWEEK! DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE OF THIS STUFF?

06:41.763 --> 06:44.297
WE JUST
HAVE GROUNDS.

06:45.133 --> 06:48.034
HEY, LET ME HAVE
SOME GROUNDS!

06:48.770 --> 06:50.369
GROSS,
CARTMAN!

06:50.371 --> 06:52.205
WHOOOPPPEEEE!!

06:54.275 --> 06:56.175
OH, MY
STOMACH HURTS.

06:56.177 --> 06:57.543
YEAH, MINE TOO.
I WONDER WHY.

06:57.545 --> 07:01.047
IT'S 3:30 AND I DON'T SEE
ANY GODDAMNED UNDERPANTS GNOMES.

07:01.049 --> 07:01.714
AGH!

07:01.716 --> 07:02.815
MAYBE IT WAS
ALL IN MY HEAD!

07:02.817 --> 07:04.350
MAYBE
I'M GOING INSANE!

07:04.352 --> 07:05.351
OH NO,
I'M GOING INSANE!

07:05.353 --> 07:07.820
THIS IS JUST GREAT,
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING DONE,

07:07.822 --> 07:09.055
AND WE'RE
TOTALLY SCREWED!

07:09.057 --> 07:10.923
HOW'S THE REPORT
GOING, BOYS?

07:10.925 --> 07:11.524
BAD.

07:11.526 --> 07:12.825
DO YOU NEED
SOME MORE COFFEE?

07:12.827 --> 07:15.027
NO-MORE-COFFEE.

07:15.029 --> 07:17.496
WELL, BOYS,
I DON'T MEAN TO PRY BUT...

07:17.498 --> 07:20.299
IF YOU WANT IT,
I WROTE YOUR REPORT FOR YOU.

07:20.301 --> 07:21.434
( all together )
YOU DID?!

07:21.436 --> 07:23.636
YES, IT'S ALL ABOUT
CORPORATE TAKEOVERS.

07:23.638 --> 07:25.972
OF COURSE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO USE IT.

07:25.974 --> 07:26.806
NO, WE'LL USE IT!

07:26.808 --> 07:28.608
ALRIGHT, AND IT CAN BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET

07:28.610 --> 07:30.142
ABOUT WHO WROTE IT,
RIGHT?

07:30.144 --> 07:31.010
( Stanly )
SURE!

07:31.012 --> 07:32.878
WHEN YOU GIVE THE REPORT,
JUST MAKE SURE

07:32.880 --> 07:35.248
THAT YOU READ
THIS PART FIRST, ALRIGHT?

07:35.250 --> 07:36.949
THERE THEY ARE!

07:36.951 --> 07:38.784
AND THEN, SOMEONE SHOULD
DO THE SECOND PART

07:38.786 --> 07:40.052
AND REALLY, REALLY
PLAY IT UP.

07:40.054 --> 07:42.488
REALLY PLAY
THE SYMPATHY ANGLE,
THEY'LL LIKE THAT.

07:42.490 --> 07:44.357
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET
A PASSING GRADE FOR THAT.

07:44.359 --> 07:48.494
YOU GUYS, LOOK, LOOK,
YOU'RE MISSING IT!

07:48.496 --> 07:51.264
♪ WE WON'T STOP UNTIL
WE HAVE UNDERPANTS ♪

07:51.266 --> 07:53.399
AGH! THEY TOOK
'EM AGAIN!

07:53.401 --> 07:54.267
THANKS, DUDE!

07:54.269 --> 07:55.568
MY PLEASURE,
GOODNIGHT BOYS.

07:55.570 --> 07:56.836
WOW TWEEK,
YOUR DAD ROCKS.

07:56.838 --> 07:58.404
WHY DO THEY
TORTURE ME LIKE THIS?!

07:58.406 --> 07:59.639
WHY CAN'T THEY
LEAVE ME ALONE?!

07:59.641 --> 08:01.374
DAMNIT, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU, TWEEK?

08:01.376 --> 08:02.908
THEY TOOK
MY UNDERPANTS AGAIN.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.710
SOON THEY'LL
WANT MY BLOOD...

08:04.712 --> 08:06.512
BLOOD!

08:11.386 --> 08:14.320
"AND AS THE VOLUMINOUS
CORPORATE AUTOMATON

08:14.322 --> 08:16.622
"BULLDOZES ITS WAY
THROUGH BANTAM AMERICA...

08:16.624 --> 08:17.590
"WHAT WILL BECOME

08:17.592 --> 08:20.926
OF THE ENDEAVORING
AMERICAN FAMILY?"

08:20.928 --> 08:22.728
I DON'T THINK
THEY WROTE THIS, MR. HAT!

08:22.730 --> 08:26.799
"PERHAPS THERE IS NO STOPPING
THE CORPORATE MACHINE."

08:26.801 --> 08:27.433
AGH!

08:27.435 --> 08:28.968
AND THAT'S
OUR REPORT...

08:28.970 --> 08:29.735
I GUESS.

08:29.737 --> 08:31.737
IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN--

08:31.739 --> 08:32.838
GREAT JOB!

08:32.840 --> 08:33.739
YES, GREAT JOB.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.675
BOYS, YOU HAVE REALLY
OPENED OUR EYES!

08:35.677 --> 08:37.910
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THIS WAS HAPPENING!

08:37.912 --> 08:38.778
NEITHER
DID WE.

08:38.780 --> 08:41.347
MR. GARRISON, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE WERE WRONG ABOUT YOU.

08:41.349 --> 08:43.015
YOU REALLY ARE TEACHING
THESE KIDS SOMETHING.

08:43.017 --> 08:45.651
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T WANT TO
SOUND LIKE A DICKHOLE,

08:45.653 --> 08:47.053
BUT I TOLD YOU SO.

08:47.055 --> 08:47.953
I AM REALLY MOVED.

08:47.955 --> 08:50.489
I SAY WE FOLLOW
THESE BOYS' CAUSE!

08:50.491 --> 08:53.492
LET'S JOIN THEM IN THE FIGHT
AGAINST CORPORATE TAKEOVERS!

08:53.494 --> 08:55.461
LEAD THE WAY,
BOYS!

08:55.463 --> 08:56.128
HUH?

08:56.130 --> 08:58.264
AGH!
TOO MUCH PRESSURE!

08:59.100 --> 09:00.333
GOOD!

09:00.335 --> 09:01.000
GOOD!

09:01.002 --> 09:03.336
MAKE SURE THAT SIGN IS REALLY
BRIGHT AND FLASHY NOW!

09:03.338 --> 09:07.640
MY GOODNESS, THAT'S GOING TO BE
A HUGE COFFEEHOUSE, HONEY.

09:07.642 --> 09:08.441
YES IT IS.

09:08.443 --> 09:10.743
THEY REALLY HAVE MY BALLS
IN A JUICE-MAKER.

09:10.745 --> 09:11.677
OH HELLO, SON!

09:11.679 --> 09:13.512
HOW DID
YOUR REPORT GO?

09:13.514 --> 09:14.146
WAH!

09:14.148 --> 09:15.114
I THINK
IT WENT REALLY GOOD.

09:15.116 --> 09:16.582
THOSE PEOPLE
REALLY GOT INTO IT.

09:16.584 --> 09:17.283
REALLY?

09:17.285 --> 09:19.352
YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST
SAVED THE FAMILY BUSINESS!

09:19.354 --> 09:20.953
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

09:20.955 --> 09:21.887
I NEED COFFEE!

09:21.889 --> 09:23.189
I KNOW HOW
YOU BOYS FEEL.

09:23.191 --> 09:25.091
SOMETIMES A HOT CUP
OF FRENCH ROAST AMARETTO

09:25.093 --> 09:27.626
IS JUST WHAT A MAN NEEDS
TO GET HIM THROUGH THE DAY.

09:27.628 --> 09:28.961
THAT SMOOTH AROMA
AND MILD TASTE

09:28.963 --> 09:31.530
IS WHAT MAKES TWEEK COFFEE
SO VERY SPECIAL...

09:31.532 --> 09:35.000
SPECIAL LIKE AN ARIZONA SUNRISE
OR A JUNIPER WET WITH DEW...

09:35.002 --> 09:37.203
A LIGHT RAIN IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DUSTY AFTERNOON,

09:37.205 --> 09:39.405
OR A HUG FROM
YOUR DEAR OLD AUNTIE--

09:39.407 --> 09:40.005
DAD!

09:40.007 --> 09:40.573
WHAT?

09:40.575 --> 09:41.607
THE METAPHORS, MAN.

09:41.609 --> 09:42.274
OH, SORRY.

09:42.276 --> 09:42.975
HERE YOU GO.

09:42.977 --> 09:45.177
DO EVER THINK MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T GIVE YOUR SON COFFEE?

09:45.179 --> 09:46.679
LIKE HOW
DO YOU MEAN?

09:46.681 --> 09:47.513
LIKE
LOOK AT HIM.

09:47.515 --> 09:49.115
HE'S ALWAYS SHAKING
AND NERVOUS.

09:49.117 --> 09:49.682
AGH!

09:49.684 --> 09:50.449
OH, THAT.

09:50.451 --> 09:52.351
HE HAS A.D.D.,
ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER.

09:52.353 --> 09:54.754
THAT'S WHY HE'S
SO JITTERY ALL THE TIME.

09:54.756 --> 09:56.188
MR. TWEEK!

09:56.190 --> 09:57.790
WE'VE ONLY
JUST HEARD!

09:57.792 --> 10:00.359
OH, HELLO COMMITTEE MEMBERS,
WHAT A SURPRISE.

10:00.361 --> 10:02.128
SO THIS IS
THE CORPORATE BULLDOZER

10:02.130 --> 10:04.330
TRYING TO PUSH YOU
OFF THE MAP?

10:04.332 --> 10:05.364
YES, HOW
DID YOU HEAR?

10:05.366 --> 10:07.833
THESE BOYS DID AN EXCELLENT
REPORT FOR US THIS MORNING.

10:07.835 --> 10:10.569
THEY'RE SO UPSET
BY THIS WHOLE THING.

10:10.571 --> 10:11.370
MY BUTT HURTS.

10:11.372 --> 10:12.338
DON'T WORRY,
MR. TWEEK.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.140
THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT
GOING TO LET YOU

10:14.142 --> 10:17.042
BE RUN OUT OF BUSINESS
BY THESE BASTARDS!

10:17.044 --> 10:17.843
YOU HEAR THAT?!

10:17.845 --> 10:20.079
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

10:20.081 --> 10:20.980
EXCUSE ME?

10:20.982 --> 10:22.114
BOYS, WE'VE
TALKED IT OVER,

10:22.116 --> 10:25.451
AND WE WANT YOU TO TAKE
YOUR CASE TO THE MAYOR!

10:25.453 --> 10:26.152
OUR CASE?

10:26.154 --> 10:27.052
AGH!
NO WAY, MAN!

10:27.054 --> 10:28.454
THAT IS WAY
TOO MUCH PRESSURE!

10:28.456 --> 10:29.822
OH, YOU'LL
DO FINE, SON.

10:29.824 --> 10:31.690
COME ON, BOYS,
LET'S GO!

10:31.692 --> 10:33.025
AW, MAN,
THIS SUCKS!

10:33.027 --> 10:34.593
AGH!

10:34.595 --> 10:37.997
AND WE WOULD HAVE NEVER EVEN
KNOWN THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING

10:37.999 --> 10:40.199
IF NOT FOR THESE BOYS'
EXCELLENT REPORT!

10:40.201 --> 10:42.568
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT STUDENTS
FROM MR. GARRISON'S CLASS

10:42.570 --> 10:46.672
ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING THAT
HAD SOME KIND OF RELEVANCE
TO THE WORLD?

10:46.674 --> 10:47.440
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:47.442 --> 10:50.609
MR. GARRISON,
THE GUY WITH THE PUPPET.

10:50.611 --> 10:51.210
YES.

10:51.212 --> 10:52.244
WELL, I MUST SAY,
GARRISON,

10:52.246 --> 10:53.479
PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT
AS STUPID AND CRAZY

10:53.481 --> 10:55.014
AS I ALWAYS
TELL PEOPLE YOU ARE.

10:55.016 --> 10:55.815
THANK YOU, MAYOR.

10:55.817 --> 10:57.450
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND
LIKE A DICKHOLE, BUT I--

10:57.452 --> 11:00.553
MAYOR, THESE BOYS WANT THAT
HARBUCKS COFFEE SHUT DOWN

11:00.555 --> 11:01.654
RIGHT NOW!

11:01.656 --> 11:02.321
YEAH!

11:02.323 --> 11:03.656
WELL, I CAN'T
JUST SHUT THEM DOWN.

11:03.658 --> 11:04.723
THIS IS
A FREE COUNTRY.

11:04.725 --> 11:06.158
BUT THEY'RE
RUINING OUR CITY!

11:06.160 --> 11:08.561
LOOK, THE BEST I CAN DO
IS CREATE A PROPOSITION.

11:08.563 --> 11:09.595
WE'LL CALL IT
"PROP 10".

11:09.597 --> 11:11.764
THE TOWN CAN VOTE ON IT,
AND IF IT PASSES...

11:11.766 --> 11:13.466
WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO.

11:13.468 --> 11:14.567
HOORAY!

11:14.569 --> 11:15.634
WHAT DO YOU
SAY, BOYS?

11:15.636 --> 11:17.336
WE'RE GONNA
PASS A LAW!

11:17.338 --> 11:18.003
UH...

11:18.005 --> 11:18.771
HOORAY.

11:18.773 --> 11:20.072
SO I GUESS YOU WANT
TO DO SOME CAMPAIGNING.

11:20.074 --> 11:22.241
YOU CAN DO COMMERCIALS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

11:22.243 --> 11:24.610
THEN WE'LL HAVE A VOTE
IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN,

11:24.612 --> 11:27.446
AND OBVIOUSLY IF MORE THAN
50% OF THE PEOPLE...

11:27.448 --> 11:28.147
AGH!

11:28.149 --> 11:31.717
...AND WANT HARBUCKS OUT,
THEN THEY'RE OUT.

11:31.719 --> 11:33.752
SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

11:33.754 --> 11:35.421
DIDN'T YOU
SEE THEM?

11:35.423 --> 11:36.489
ALRIGHT,
WHAT'S NEXT?

11:36.491 --> 11:39.558
NEXT IS ISSUE 37-D,
MISSING UNDERPANTS.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.860
IS IT COLD
IN HERE?

11:40.862 --> 11:43.195
OH BOYS, COULD I HAVE A QUICK
"THIS N' THAT" WITH YOU?

11:43.197 --> 11:44.630
BOYS, I DON'T KNOW
WHO WROTE THAT REPORT,

11:44.632 --> 11:47.366
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE
CONVINCED EVERYBODY,
YOU BETTER STICK WITH IT.

11:47.368 --> 11:50.436
BECAUSE IF THESE PEOPLE
FIND OUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY
WRITE THAT PAPER,

11:50.438 --> 11:51.837
AND I ACTUALLY
DO GET FIRED,

11:51.839 --> 11:55.040
THEN MR. HAT IS GONNA DO
HORRIBLE THINGS TO YOU.

11:55.042 --> 11:58.210
OH, NOT THAT,
MR. HAT!

11:58.212 --> 11:59.378
THAT'S<i> REALLY</i>
HORRIBLE!

11:59.380 --> 12:01.580
ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK
PASSING YOUR NEW LAW.

12:01.582 --> 12:05.384
JESUS, MAN, JESUS!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, HUH?

12:05.386 --> 12:07.987
( announcer )
LIVE...

12:08.556 --> 12:09.755
ON PUBLIC ACCESS.

12:09.757 --> 12:10.956
TONIGHT'S TOPIC...

12:10.958 --> 12:15.227
SHOULD HARBUCKS BE ALLOWED
TO OPEN A STORE IN SOUTH PARK?

12:15.229 --> 12:16.662
THAT'S TONIGHT'S TOPIC.

12:16.664 --> 12:19.832
ON MY LEFT, FIVE, INNOCENT,
STARRY EYED BOYS

12:19.834 --> 12:20.766
FROM MIDDLE AMERICA.

12:20.768 --> 12:24.036
ON MY RIGHT, A BIG FAT, SMELLY
CORPORATE GUY FROM NEW YORK.

12:24.038 --> 12:24.904
( booing )

12:24.906 --> 12:27.072
HEY, I'M NOT FAT
OR SMELLY!

12:27.074 --> 12:28.908
ALRIGHT,
MR. DOUCHEBAG.

12:28.910 --> 12:29.642
POSTUM!

12:29.644 --> 12:30.709
OH, PARDON ME,
MR. ASS-FACE.

12:30.711 --> 12:33.078
ANYWAY, LET'S HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT.

12:33.080 --> 12:33.946
BOO!

12:33.948 --> 12:34.847
MY ARGUMENT IS SIMPLE.

12:34.849 --> 12:38.484
THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED
ON FREE ENTERPRISE.

12:38.486 --> 12:39.218
( hissing )

12:39.220 --> 12:40.619
HARBUCKS IS
AN ORGANIZATION THAT--

12:40.621 --> 12:44.623
AN ORGANIZATION THAT
PRIDES ITSELF ON GREAT COFFEE!

12:44.625 --> 12:47.593
WE SIMPLY WANT--
AW, TO HELL WITH YOU!

12:47.595 --> 12:49.295
OKAY UCK-UP-FAY,

12:49.297 --> 12:51.030
NOW FOR THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE ARGUMENT,

12:51.032 --> 12:54.233
WE TURN TO OUR YOUNG,
HANDSOME LADS.

12:54.869 --> 12:57.303
BOYS,
YOUR THOUGHTS?

12:57.305 --> 12:58.938
COME ON, BOYS,
DON'T BE SHY.

12:58.940 --> 13:01.607
WHAT'S YOUR
PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT?

13:04.312 --> 13:05.311
UH...

13:05.313 --> 13:06.045
UH...

13:06.047 --> 13:07.813
THIS GUY
SUCKS ASS!

13:07.815 --> 13:08.581
( cheering )

13:08.583 --> 13:11.584
GREAT ARGUMENT!
YOU WIN, BOYS!

13:11.586 --> 13:12.284
WHAT?!

13:12.286 --> 13:14.954
THAT WAS CLOSE,
MR. HAT.

13:15.356 --> 13:17.656
( announcer )
What is
the future of America?

13:17.658 --> 13:19.291
Is it the
money we make?

13:19.293 --> 13:20.759
The quests we conquer?

13:20.761 --> 13:22.494
No...
it's children...

13:22.496 --> 13:26.465
So what do children have to
say about Prop 10?

13:26.467 --> 13:28.300
I don't like
big corporations.

13:28.302 --> 13:29.902
I like
small businesses.

13:29.904 --> 13:33.839
I believe in
the family owned enterprise.

13:33.841 --> 13:36.508
( mumbling )

13:36.510 --> 13:37.743
Agh!

13:37.745 --> 13:40.946
It's time to stop
large corporations.

13:40.948 --> 13:43.082
Prop 10
is about children.

13:43.084 --> 13:45.718
Vote yes on
Prop 10, or else

13:45.720 --> 13:47.119
you hate children.

13:47.121 --> 13:50.022
You don't hate children,

13:50.024 --> 13:51.991
do you?

13:51.993 --> 13:52.791
Remember...

13:52.793 --> 13:55.527
keep American business small,
or else...

13:55.529 --> 13:58.998
Paid for by citizens
for a fair and equal way

13:59.000 --> 14:02.368
to get Harbucks Coffee
kicked out of town forever.

14:02.370 --> 14:05.204
WELL?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:05.206 --> 14:06.872
WOW!
IT'S GREAT!

14:06.874 --> 14:07.673
YES, IT IS!

14:07.675 --> 14:09.608
WE'LL PUT IT ON
THE AIR IMMEDIATELY!

14:09.610 --> 14:10.709
WHAT DO
YOU THINK, HON?

14:10.711 --> 14:12.878
HON?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:12.880 --> 14:14.980
I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH THIS.

14:14.982 --> 14:15.914
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:15.916 --> 14:18.250
WE'RE JUST USING THOSE BOYS
FOR OUR BENEFIT.

14:18.252 --> 14:20.152
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

14:20.154 --> 14:22.187
BUT KIDS ARE GREAT
TO GET PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE.

14:22.189 --> 14:25.591
YOU DON'T JUST THROW A CHILD
IN A POLITICAL COMMERCIAL

14:25.593 --> 14:27.059
TO SELL
YOUR BELIEFS.

14:27.061 --> 14:29.094
I WON'T BE A PART
OF THIS ANYMORE.

14:29.096 --> 14:31.997
HONEY, ALL'S FAIR
IN LOVE AND WAR...

14:31.999 --> 14:33.532
AND COFFEE...

14:33.534 --> 14:34.533
HON?

14:34.535 --> 14:38.103
HON?

14:38.105 --> 14:40.205
TAKE YOUR
CORPORATE COFFEE

14:40.207 --> 14:42.708
AND GO BACK
TO NEW YORK CITY!

14:42.710 --> 14:43.475
( cheering )

14:43.477 --> 14:48.480
IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO ARE
RUINING MAIN STREET, USA!

14:48.482 --> 14:50.883
HOW MANY NATIVE AMERICANS
DID YOU SLAUGHTER

14:50.885 --> 14:53.952
TO MAKE
THAT COFFEE, HUH?!

14:54.455 --> 14:55.220
( cheering )

14:55.222 --> 14:57.189
DAMN, THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T BUYING ANY COFFEE.

14:57.191 --> 15:01.326
I'LL HAVE TO TRY AND APPEAL
TO THE YOUNGER CROWD.

15:01.729 --> 15:02.628
HEY, KIDS!

15:02.630 --> 15:06.031
I'M CAMEL JOE AND I LOVE
A FRESH CUP OF COFFEE!

15:06.033 --> 15:07.866
IT'S YUM
<i>DILLISCIOS</i>!

15:07.868 --> 15:11.203
AND IT MAKES
YOU FEEL SUPER!

15:11.439 --> 15:13.338
I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU!

15:13.340 --> 15:15.708
THE NEW "KIDDIE-CINO"
FROM HARBUCKS!

15:15.710 --> 15:17.910
MORE SUGAR AND ALL
THE OTHER GOODIES KIDS LIKE

15:17.912 --> 15:21.380
WITH ALL THE CAFFEINE
OF A NORMAL DOUBLE LATTE!

15:21.382 --> 15:23.382
NO BILLY,
NO COFFEE FOR YOU!

15:23.384 --> 15:25.417
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF!

15:25.419 --> 15:28.153
USING CARTOONS TO PUSH
CAFFEINE ON CHILDREN!

15:28.155 --> 15:31.323
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO THE HOLE YOU
CRAWLED OUT FROM, LADY!

15:31.325 --> 15:34.393
MR. POSTUM, I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN

15:34.395 --> 15:36.295
ABOUT MAKING COFFEE.

15:36.297 --> 15:37.262
OH, AND
YOU DON'T?

15:37.264 --> 15:39.932
YOUR COFFEE TASTES LIKE
THREE DAY OLD MOLDY DIARRHEA.

15:39.934 --> 15:41.800
WELL, I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU
THAT THIS TOWN

15:41.802 --> 15:42.968
IS HAVING
A VOTE TOMORROW,

15:42.970 --> 15:45.671
AND IF THE LAW PASSES, YOU'RE
GONNA BE THROWN OUT OF TOWN.

15:45.673 --> 15:46.438
WHAT?!

15:46.440 --> 15:48.507
AT 5:00, THE BEST COFFEE WINS,
EITHER YOUR COFFEE...

15:48.509 --> 15:50.743
OR A FRESH WARM CUP
OF TWEEK'S COFFEE,

15:50.745 --> 15:53.612
LIKE AN OLD SWEATER THAT KEEPS
GETTING WARMER WITH AGE,

15:53.614 --> 15:56.815
YOU CAN COUNT ON TWEEK'S COFFEE
TO START YOUR DAY.

15:56.817 --> 16:00.619
TOMORROW FOR THE PROP 10 VOTE
WE'LL SET UP BALLOT BOOTHS...

16:00.621 --> 16:01.253
HERE.

16:01.255 --> 16:02.654
ALRIGHT, THEN WE'LL
THROW UP THE STAGE HERE.

16:02.656 --> 16:05.124
BEFORE THE VOTE WE'LL
GET A BAND EVERYONE LIKES...

16:05.126 --> 16:06.892
LIKE, UH, LIKE...

16:06.894 --> 16:07.860
TOTO.

16:07.862 --> 16:08.660
LIKE TOTO.

16:08.662 --> 16:10.195
AND THEN THE HARBUCKS GUY
WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO SPEAK

16:10.197 --> 16:11.864
AND THE BOYS WILL HAVE
FIVE MINUTES TO SPEAK,

16:11.866 --> 16:13.098
AND THEN
THE TOWN VOTES!

16:13.100 --> 16:15.734
UH, BOYS, YOU BETTER
GET YOUR ASSES TO WORK.

16:15.736 --> 16:16.702
WHAT NOW?

16:16.704 --> 16:18.604
THEY'RE EXPECTING YOU
TO GIVE A BIG SPEECH
ON CORPORATE TAKEOVERS

16:18.606 --> 16:20.606
AND THIS TIME IT HAS
TO LAST FIVE MINUTES.

16:20.608 --> 16:22.608
OH, GOD!
WHEN IS THIS GONNA END!

16:22.610 --> 16:24.143
YOUR DAD REALLY
SCREWED US, TWEEK!

16:24.145 --> 16:26.078
JESUS, DUDE!
I'M TO BLAME FOR ALL THIS!

16:26.080 --> 16:28.714
I'M TO BLAME
FOR EVERYTHING!

16:31.118 --> 16:32.384
SO WHAT ARE
WE GONNA SAY?

16:32.386 --> 16:34.219
WHY CAN'T WE JUST READ THE PAPER
WE WROTE LAST TIME?

16:34.221 --> 16:36.321
CUZ' THEN THEY'LL KNOW
WE DIDN'T WRITE IT, DUMMY!

16:36.323 --> 16:37.256
WE HAVE
TO BE ORIGINAL!

16:37.258 --> 16:39.491
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT CORPORATIONS?

16:39.493 --> 16:40.926
( gasping )

16:41.762 --> 16:44.196
I THINK MY MOM
IS A CORPORATION.

16:44.198 --> 16:45.497
YEAH,
THAT MAKES SENSE.

16:45.499 --> 16:46.431
YOU GUYS!
SHH!

16:46.433 --> 16:48.233
HOW ABOUT WE JUST SAY,
CORPORATE SHOULD BE STOPPED.

16:48.235 --> 16:49.701
HOW DO WE STRETCH THAT
INTO FIVE MINUTES?

16:49.703 --> 16:51.436
THEY'RE TAKING
MY UNDERPANTS!

16:51.438 --> 16:53.639
WILL YOU STOP WITH
THE UNDERPANTS GNOMES?

16:53.641 --> 16:55.073
WE HAVE TO WORK HERE!

16:55.075 --> 16:56.341
AAHH!

16:56.844 --> 16:58.944
WHAT THE HELL?

16:58.946 --> 17:00.279
WELL,
I'LL BE DAMNED.

17:00.281 --> 17:03.448
THAT'S MY LAST PAIR
OF UNDERPANTS!

17:07.154 --> 17:08.720
SHH,
DON'T SCARE HIM!

17:08.722 --> 17:10.422
HEY THERE,
LITTLE GUY.

17:10.424 --> 17:11.056
BAD!

17:11.058 --> 17:11.957
CARTMAN!

17:11.959 --> 17:12.758
WHAT?!

17:12.760 --> 17:14.059
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
HIT STUFF WITH A STICK?

17:14.061 --> 17:15.828
WELL LOOK AT HIM,
HE'S ALL, YOU KNOW...

17:15.830 --> 17:16.595
LOOK AT HIM.

17:16.597 --> 17:18.330
IS THAT ALL
YOU GOT, PUSSY?

17:18.332 --> 17:18.931
WHAT?!

17:18.933 --> 17:19.731
HEY, HE TALKED!

17:19.733 --> 17:20.666
YEAH, HE CALLED ME
A PUSSY.

17:20.668 --> 17:21.867
I'M NOT A PUSSY,
YOU'RE A PUSSY!

17:21.869 --> 17:22.935
YOU'RE A PUSSY,
PUSSY!

17:22.937 --> 17:24.536
DUDE, WHY ARE YOU TAKING
TWEEK'S UNDERPANTS?

17:24.538 --> 17:26.972
YEAH, LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TO THIS POOR KID!

17:26.974 --> 17:27.639
AGH!

17:27.641 --> 17:29.208
STEALING UNDERPANTS,
BIG BUSINESS!

17:29.210 --> 17:29.908
BUSINESS?

17:29.910 --> 17:31.009
WAIT, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BUSINESS?

17:31.011 --> 17:32.678
SURE, THAT'S WHAT
GNOMES DO!

17:32.680 --> 17:33.378
SHOW US!

17:33.380 --> 17:35.314
OKAY,
FOLLOW ME!

17:35.850 --> 17:37.015
LITTLE
PUSSY GNOME!

17:37.017 --> 17:39.985
DON'T CALL ME A PUSSY!
PUSSY GNOME.

17:40.521 --> 17:42.087
NOT MUCH
LONGER NOW!

17:42.089 --> 17:44.423
ARE YOU TAKING US TO
YOUR LITTLE PUSSY HOUSE?

17:44.425 --> 17:46.425
NO, PUSSY, I'M TAKING YOU
TO MY VILLAGE.

17:46.427 --> 17:47.459
OH, YOUR
PUSSY VILLAGE?

17:47.461 --> 17:49.494
WILL YOU JUST SHUT UP
AND LET HIM SHOW US!

17:49.496 --> 17:50.762
FOLLOW ME!

17:50.764 --> 17:54.733
I HOPE WE'RE NOT WASTING OUR
TIME WITH THIS LITTLE PECKER.

17:58.038 --> 17:59.905
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE HARBUCKS

17:59.907 --> 18:01.573
WILL NEVER
MAKE IT IN THIS TOWN.

18:01.575 --> 18:03.041
ALRIGHT, BOYS,
THAT'S IT!

18:03.043 --> 18:05.010
PACK IT UP,
WE'RE MOVING OUT OF TOWN!

18:05.012 --> 18:06.211
AW, BUT WE
JUST FINISHED!

18:06.213 --> 18:09.548
I KNOW, BUT THESE FOLKS
OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT US HERE.

18:09.550 --> 18:10.983
BUT WHAT WILL
BECOME OF US?

18:10.985 --> 18:16.255
OH, QUIT BEING SO MELODRAMATIC,
SANCHEZ, JESUS CHRIST.

18:16.557 --> 18:18.123
DAMN, DUDE,
THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

18:18.125 --> 18:21.093
YEAH, IT'S ALMOST
AS BIG AS CARTMAN'S ASS.

18:21.095 --> 18:22.661
NO IT ISN'T,
YOU GUYS.

18:22.663 --> 18:24.363
THIS IS WHERE
ALL OUR WORK IS DONE!

18:24.365 --> 18:26.932
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH
ALL THESE UNDERPANTS YOU STEAL?

18:26.934 --> 18:29.434
COLLECTING UNDERPANTS
IS JUST PHASE ONE.

18:29.436 --> 18:31.603
PHASE ONE,
COLLECT UNDERPANTS.

18:31.605 --> 18:34.339
SO, WHAT'S
PHASE TWO?

18:37.044 --> 18:38.977
HEY,
WHAT'S PHASE TWO?!

18:38.979 --> 18:40.779
PHASE ONE,
WE COLLECT UNDERPANTS.

18:40.781 --> 18:44.616
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT WHAT ABOUT PHASE TWO?

18:45.219 --> 18:48.220
WELL, PHASE THREE
IS PROFIT!

18:48.222 --> 18:48.887
GET IT?

18:48.889 --> 18:49.721
I DON'T GET IT.

18:49.723 --> 18:51.957
YOU SEE, PHASE ONE,
COLLECT UNDERPANTS.

18:51.959 --> 18:53.191
PHASE TWO...

18:53.193 --> 18:55.594
PHASE THREE,
PROFIT!

18:55.596 --> 18:56.528
OH, I GET IT.

18:56.530 --> 18:57.529
NO YOU DON'T,
FAT-ASS!

18:57.531 --> 18:59.798
DO YOU GUYS KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CORPORATIONS?

18:59.800 --> 19:00.632
YOU BET WE DO!

19:00.634 --> 19:03.936
US GNOMES ARE GENIUSES
AT CORPORATIONS!

19:05.472 --> 19:08.440
JESUS CHRIST,
LOOK OUT!

19:08.876 --> 19:10.842
OH MY GOD,
THEY KILLED KENNY.

19:10.844 --> 19:11.743
YOU BASTARDS.

19:11.745 --> 19:13.679
WE HAVE TO GIVE
A SPEECH TOMORROW
ABOUT CORPORATE TAKEOVERS.

19:13.681 --> 19:15.380
HOLY @#$%!
WE KILLED YOUR FRIEND!

19:15.382 --> 19:19.551
WE'VE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT
CORPORATE TAKEOVERS TOMORROW
OR WE'RE SCREWED.

19:19.553 --> 19:21.253
CHRIST! WE SQUISHED HIM
LIKE A BUG!!

19:21.255 --> 19:23.121
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CORPORATE TAKEOVERS?

19:23.123 --> 19:26.458
WELL, WE CAN EXPLAIN
THAT TO YOU EASILY.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.993
YES, FOR A PRICE.

19:27.995 --> 19:28.593
WHAT?

19:28.595 --> 19:29.361
YOU KNOW.

19:29.363 --> 19:30.195
UNDERPANTS?

19:30.197 --> 19:36.034
( gnomes )
UNDERPANTS!

19:36.036 --> 19:38.904
TOTO,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

19:39.239 --> 19:40.305
YEAH, TOTO!

19:40.307 --> 19:42.007
WHOO,
TOTO!

19:42.009 --> 19:45.510
ALRIGHT, AND NOW BEFORE
WE ALL VOTE YES ON PROP 10,

19:45.512 --> 19:46.645
HERE TO
REMIND US WHY,

19:46.647 --> 19:50.182
ARE THE LOVABLE,
INNOCENT CHILDREN.

19:50.184 --> 19:52.951
SINCE WE ARE SO CONCERNED
WITH THE CORPORATE TAKEOVERS,

19:52.953 --> 19:55.520
WE WENT AND ASKED OUR FRIENDS
THE UNDERPANTS GNOMES,

19:55.522 --> 19:57.956
AND THEY TOLD US ALL ABOUT
BIG CORPORATIONS.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.191
( male )
UNDERPANTS GNOMES?

19:59.193 --> 20:00.926
BIG CORPORATIONS
ARE GOOD!

20:00.928 --> 20:01.860
( male )
WHAT? GOOD?

20:01.862 --> 20:05.330
BECAUSE WITHOUT BIG CORPORATIONS
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THINGS LIKE

20:05.332 --> 20:06.999
CARS AND COMPUTERS
AND CANNED SOUP.

20:07.001 --> 20:10.002
EVEN HARBUCKS COFFEE STARTED OFF
AS A SMALL LITTLE BUSINESS,

20:10.004 --> 20:11.570
BUT BECAUSE IT
MADE SUCH GREAT COFFEE,

20:11.572 --> 20:13.672
AND BECAUSE THEY
RAN THEIR BUSINESS SO WELL,

20:13.674 --> 20:14.906
THEY MANAGED
TO GROW AND GROW

20:14.908 --> 20:17.142
UNTIL IT BECAME
THE CORPORATE POWERHOUSE
IT IS TODAY.

20:17.144 --> 20:20.812
AND THAT IS WHY WE SHOULD
ALL LET HARBUCKS STAY!

20:23.150 --> 20:25.684
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU SAID LAST TIME!

20:25.686 --> 20:26.351
UH...

20:26.353 --> 20:29.221
THE TRUTH IS, WE DIDN'T
WRITE THAT PAPER LAST TIME.

20:29.223 --> 20:30.088
YOU LITTLE TURD!

20:30.090 --> 20:33.892
YOU RUINED MY LIFE
FOR THE LAST TIME!

20:36.730 --> 20:39.031
THESE BOYS ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!

20:39.033 --> 20:40.265
WE'VE BEEN
USING THESE POOR KIDS

20:40.267 --> 20:43.468
TO PULL AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS
FOR OUR CAUSE AND IT'S WRONG.

20:43.470 --> 20:45.771
WE'RE AS LOW AND DESPICABLE
AS ROB REINER.

20:45.773 --> 20:47.172
YOU KEEP PROTESTING
AND COMPLAINING,

20:47.174 --> 20:51.810
BUT DID ANY OF YOU EVER
EVEN BOTHER TO<i> TASTE</i>
HARBUCKS COFFEE?

20:51.812 --> 20:54.479
HARBUCKS COFFEE GOT TO WHERE
IT IS BY BEING THE BEST.

20:54.481 --> 20:58.183
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
AT LEAST TRY IT?

21:02.389 --> 21:03.088
HEY!

21:03.090 --> 21:04.122
THIS IS PRETTY
DAMN GOOD!

21:04.124 --> 21:07.592
YEAH, IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT
BLAND, RAW SEWAGE TASTE

21:07.594 --> 21:10.962
THAT TWEEK'S
COFFEE HAS.

21:12.032 --> 21:13.999
HEY, HEY,
THAT<i> IS</i> GOOD!

21:14.001 --> 21:15.367
IT'S A FRENCH ROAST.

21:15.369 --> 21:16.435
IT'S SUBTLE
AND MILD.

21:16.437 --> 21:19.604
MILD LIKE THAT FIRST SPLASH
OF SUN ON AN APRIL MORNING.

21:19.606 --> 21:22.607
THIS COFFEE IS COFFEE
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

21:22.609 --> 21:23.809
HEY, NO HARD
FEELINGS, TWEEK.

21:23.811 --> 21:27.646
YOU KNOW, WE STILL
NEED SOMEONE TO RUN
THIS HARBUCKS COFFEEHOUSE.

21:27.648 --> 21:30.382
I'M SURE IT WILL MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.

21:30.384 --> 21:31.650
THANK YOU,
MR. POSTUM.

21:31.652 --> 21:33.819
BUT I THINK WE'LL BE FINE
WITH THE MONEY WE MAKE

21:33.821 --> 21:35.887
SELLING OUR SON
INTO SLAVERY.

21:35.889 --> 21:36.488
AGH!

21:36.490 --> 21:38.156
JUST KIDDING, SON!

21:39.359 --> 21:42.027
