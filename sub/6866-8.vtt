00:30.549 --> 00:34.178
- Ugh. Why the hell is your phone on?
- Because I have a social life.

00:34.353 --> 00:36.253
<i>- Hello?
Why the hell is your phone on?</i>

00:36.422 --> 00:38.117
<i>Because I have a... Why did you call?</i>

00:38.290 --> 00:40.850
<i>- Because this is important.
- Micromanagitis.</i>

00:41.026 --> 00:44.154
<i>If we show San Marino
the flaws in their palace security...</i>

00:44.329 --> 00:47.355
<i>... they've agreed to hire us
as security consultants.</i>

00:47.533 --> 00:49.524
And I'm sure I don't need to remind you...

00:49.701 --> 00:53.569
that we haven't gotten one
of these jobs since your Uffizi fiasco.

00:56.375 --> 00:57.865
And yet, you always do.

00:58.043 --> 00:59.874
<i>Because you learned nothing from it.</i>

01:00.045 --> 01:02.843
I learned that flammable and
inflammable mean the same thing.

01:03.015 --> 01:05.074
<i>- Wait, what?
- Well, this time make sure you...</i>

01:05.250 --> 01:08.845
Mother. Oh, my God, we've been
spotted they're shooting at us. Oh, my...

01:10.355 --> 01:12.949
- Heh. Bet she's freaking out right now.
- Oh, my God.

01:13.292 --> 01:16.557
What shade is that? Crack Whore Red?

01:16.728 --> 01:20.357
- You said they were tranquilizer darts.
- Ah, I merely implied that.

01:20.532 --> 01:23.365
Damn it. So I poisoned like,
five innocent security guards?

01:23.535 --> 01:26.936
Would you relax? I'm pretty sure
San Marino has universal health care.

01:27.105 --> 01:28.732
- So?
- So that's good for them.

01:28.907 --> 01:30.704
Because there's gonna be
some neurological damage.

01:32.377 --> 01:37.212
- Oh, my. Lana.
- Wow, that is one serious diamond.

01:37.382 --> 01:39.350
But is it supposed to be brown?

01:39.518 --> 01:41.577
It's not brown, Pam.

01:41.753 --> 01:44.813
- That color is called champagne.
- Mm-hm.

01:44.990 --> 01:47.720
- And why do you have it?
- Because I...

01:47.893 --> 01:50.293
...am gonna ask Lana to marry me.

01:50.462 --> 01:52.555
And you're gonna give her that
if she says no?

01:52.731 --> 01:57.759
Like a big "screw you
in your big Lincoln-Loggy fingers"?

02:31.436 --> 02:35.031
The last thing you hear me say is,
"Oh, my God, they're shooting at us"...

02:35.207 --> 02:37.266
and you don't even call me back?
- Well...

02:37.442 --> 02:39.433
I knew you weren't in any real danger.

02:39.611 --> 02:40.635
You know, with Lana there.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.245
- Ha!
- Ha.

02:42.414 --> 02:44.382
And let's just knock off the giggling.

02:44.550 --> 02:49.146
I want game-faces on those heads
for our conference call with the prince.

02:49.321 --> 02:52.222
- I thought he was a captain regent.
- Oh, whatever.

02:52.391 --> 02:54.689
All of San Marino could fit
in the South Bronx.

02:54.860 --> 02:59.456
- The important thing is, they're loaded.
- Just shitfaced.

02:59.631 --> 03:01.360
- Oh...
- About 15 freaking beers...

03:01.533 --> 03:05.970
all that SchÃ¼tzie. And holy shit,
did I honk down a bunch of absinthe?

03:06.138 --> 03:08.629
I don't know Pam,
but could you lower your voice?

03:08.807 --> 03:13.642
I must have. Cause I hallucinated
you had an engagement...

03:13.812 --> 03:16.440
Not. Another. Word.

03:16.615 --> 03:20.449
- And just what is this, I ask you.
- Hello, Cheryl.

03:20.619 --> 03:22.678
Cyril. Are you cheating on me?

03:22.854 --> 03:26.290
- No, just trying to get my muffin back.
- Oh, no, you're not.

03:26.458 --> 03:27.789
- I'm not?
- Not like that.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.929
You gotta slug her in the
diaphragm with a forearm shiver.

03:31.096 --> 03:33.462
- Oh. That's good to know. Heh.
- Do it.

03:33.632 --> 03:35.497
Um...

03:38.070 --> 03:39.537
- Wow.
- Ugh.

03:39.705 --> 03:43.573
And no muffin. See?
Time lost is muffin lost.

03:43.742 --> 03:45.539
Along with my appetite.

03:45.711 --> 03:49.306
- For food, that is. Heh-heh.
- Ugh.

03:49.481 --> 03:50.948
Come see me.

03:51.116 --> 03:54.552
Wow. I am incredibly sorry.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.688
<i>But that is my decision, Ms. Archer.</i>

03:56.855 --> 04:00.689
<i>- And as captain regent of...
- I don't care if you're Captain...</i>

04:00.859 --> 04:02.258
Crunch. No, wait, Beefheart.

04:02.427 --> 04:04.361
- We had a deal.
- Kangaroo. Remember him?

04:04.529 --> 04:07.589
We pointed out every single flaw
in your cut-rate security system.

04:07.766 --> 04:10.462
And now not only
are you hiring another agency...

04:10.636 --> 04:11.967
you won't even pay ISIS...

04:12.137 --> 04:14.901
for that security probe.
Which means no bonuses for us.

04:15.073 --> 04:17.200
- Wait, what?
- Oh, now he cares.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.812
<i>Those monies will go to medical care
for the palace guards they poisoned.</i>

04:20.978 --> 04:22.241
- What?
- Lana did that.

04:22.414 --> 04:24.507
<i>- And as for hiring ODIN...
- ODIN?</i>

04:24.683 --> 04:28.483
<i>- Uh, skipper, if I could jump in here.
- Trexler.</i>

04:28.654 --> 04:32.112
<i>Oh, Malory. Even on...
What is this, 1080p?</i>

04:32.290 --> 04:34.554
<i>You look just as supple...</i>

04:34.726 --> 04:37.957
<i>... and sexy as the day
I first laid eyes on you.</i>

04:38.130 --> 04:39.859
<i>- Where, in a wax museum?
- Sterling!</i>

04:40.032 --> 04:43.729
<i>- That's no way to talk to your mother.
- Just who the hell do you think you are?</i>

04:43.902 --> 04:47.394
<i>- Getting ISIS blacklisted at the UN?
- Had nothing to do with that.</i>

04:47.572 --> 04:50.473
<i>- Embarrassing me in Berlin?
- The entire hotel was embarrassed.</i>

04:50.642 --> 04:52.610
Stealing all my prospective clients?

04:52.778 --> 04:54.643
<i>- Yeah.
- And no matter which way I turn...</i>

04:54.813 --> 04:58.249
you're butting in that big, fat, strong...

04:58.417 --> 05:00.817
aquiline nose of yours.
- Wait, what?

05:00.986 --> 05:04.183
<i>- You said it was the nose of a Caesar.
- Ehh...</i>

05:04.356 --> 05:06.085
Well, perhaps a lesser Caesar.

05:06.258 --> 05:09.318
<i>No, no, now, I clearly
remember you said Augustus.</i>

05:09.494 --> 05:14.454
<i>- And in vino veritas.
- The Chianti was definitely flowing.</i>

05:14.633 --> 05:16.328
<i>- Ha, ha.
- Among other things.</i>

05:16.501 --> 05:18.128
- Mother.
- Hmm? Oh, uh...

05:18.303 --> 05:21.795
this is the last time
you make me out a fool, Len Trexler.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.032
- You wanna play me hard?
- Phrasing.

05:24.209 --> 05:26.268
<i>- You know I do.
- Well, then you better nut up.</i>

05:26.445 --> 05:28.640
- Phrasing.
- Because I've swallowed just about...

05:28.814 --> 05:31.339
as much as I can take from you.
- Hey! Phrasing!

05:31.516 --> 05:33.040
And we'll see who's smirking...

05:33.218 --> 05:36.085
when ISIS steals that diamond for real.

05:36.254 --> 05:38.848
<i>- Oh, you're a naughty girl.
- Right, then.</i>

05:39.024 --> 05:43.154
Commence Operation
"Rub Len Trexler's Big Fat Nose In It."

05:43.328 --> 05:46.695
- Sounds like you already have.
- You want to break back into the palace...

05:46.865 --> 05:49.732
which now has the insane
amount of security we recommended?

05:49.901 --> 05:53.359
- Plus God knows how many ODIN guys.
- Yes, so take more of that poison.

05:53.538 --> 05:55.062
And on top of that suck-salad...

05:55.240 --> 05:58.869
you wanna sprinkle on the bacon bits
of "Let's tell them we're coming"?

05:59.745 --> 06:01.610
- Well?
- Well, there's this new thing...

06:01.780 --> 06:03.372
called the element of surprise?

06:03.548 --> 06:06.915
I'm so sorry I slammed you in the gut.
Jeez, that's how Houdini died.

06:07.085 --> 06:08.848
- Houdini died of AIDS.
- No.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.580
Why do you always say that?
And that's the thing.

06:11.757 --> 06:13.952
- I want to surprise Lana...
- Well, you nailed it.

06:14.126 --> 06:16.720
So this time I need you
to not be your normal...

06:16.895 --> 06:18.522
compulsively blabby self.

06:18.697 --> 06:21.029
Wha...? When have I ever been blabby?

06:22.701 --> 06:25.033
Guess who has breast cancer.

06:26.605 --> 06:30.598
Just one of like, two dozen equally
appalling videos on your website.

06:30.776 --> 06:32.744
They're not all equally appal...

06:32.911 --> 06:36.278
- And have I blabbed about you and Cheryl?
- She keeps seducing me.

06:36.448 --> 06:40.441
And you think you can make that unhappen
if you give Lana a tiny flake of brown mica?

06:40.619 --> 06:43.679
- Cyril, look at it.
- But I spent two months' salary.

06:43.855 --> 06:47.689
- I know. But you make shit.
- Hey, I'm doing pretty well, thank you.

06:47.859 --> 06:51.192
Save that speech for the father
you continually disappoint.

06:51.363 --> 06:53.422
I'm head of HR, Cyril,
I know your take-home.

06:53.598 --> 06:56.032
Yeah, and l... I...

06:56.201 --> 06:57.532
I take home shit.

06:57.702 --> 06:58.930
Well, we all do.

06:59.104 --> 07:01.072
What's my father ever done
that's so great?

07:01.239 --> 07:03.537
School superintendent? Big whoop.

07:03.708 --> 07:06.609
There's only like 800 kids
in the entire county.

07:06.778 --> 07:08.871
K through 12!

07:09.514 --> 07:11.505
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, you were saying?

07:11.683 --> 07:16.017
I were saying, we all make shit, so,
what we should do is unionize.

07:16.188 --> 07:18.486
Yeah. I'll get the raise I deserve.

07:18.657 --> 07:22.115
- Then you can buy Lana a big-boy ring.
- She'll promptly agree to marry me.

07:22.294 --> 07:24.455
Then you take her home
to meet your dick dad.

07:24.629 --> 07:27.598
And then I shove his hawk face
right into her big brown boobs...

07:27.766 --> 07:30.098
and scream,
"Look at those babies, old man.

07:30.268 --> 07:32.896
Didn't need a varsity letter
to get those, did I?

07:33.071 --> 07:36.734
So now who's a disappoint...?"
Oh, Jesus H. Jones, Pam.

07:38.476 --> 07:39.943
What?

07:42.380 --> 07:44.814
Carol? Carol?

07:44.983 --> 07:48.441
Oh, wait. Cheryl? Cheryl.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.985
Hello?

07:50.155 --> 07:51.782
Cheryl, I swear to God...

07:51.957 --> 07:56.257
if I have to open my own
salad again I will freak out.

07:56.428 --> 07:58.692
Where the hell is everybody?

07:58.864 --> 08:01.924
Let's assume we can't access
the palace through that same skylight.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.432
- Okay.
- But maybe we overlooked an air shaft...

08:04.603 --> 08:06.468
or maybe even
some access below-grade?

08:06.638 --> 08:09.505
- So let's pull up the palace schematics.
- Uh, okay.

08:09.674 --> 08:12.370
- Maybe today, if that works for you.
- Hang on.

08:12.544 --> 08:14.978
- Let me see. How about now? Anything?
- No.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.738
- Uh, how about now?
- No.

08:16.915 --> 08:18.280
- How about now? Anything?
- No.

08:18.450 --> 08:20.315
- What are you doing there?
- I don't know.

08:20.485 --> 08:22.749
- What, are you just hitting random keys?
- Well, obviously.

08:22.921 --> 08:25.685
Aw, damn it, we... Where is the hobbit guy?

08:25.857 --> 08:28.485
- Heh. A freaking hobbit works here?
- No. He's just a...

08:28.660 --> 08:31.128
They're called little people, not hobbits.

08:31.296 --> 08:33.321
- Will you... He's a hobbit enthusiast.
- Ooh.

08:33.498 --> 08:36.831
But he also knows how to work
all the computers and satellites and shit.

08:37.001 --> 08:38.832
But even though I do all that...

08:39.004 --> 08:41.198
I gotta live with a roommate.
In Queens.

08:41.373 --> 08:44.308
That's disgusting.
- Thanks, Bilbo. Another example...

08:44.476 --> 08:47.343
of how underpaid the ISIS
support staff really is.

08:47.512 --> 08:48.877
And I for one am fed up.

08:49.047 --> 08:51.072
Yeah, fed full of muffins and denial.

08:51.249 --> 08:53.217
What's your problem, neck bones?

08:53.385 --> 08:56.718
My problem is I remember what
Ms. Archer did to the cleaning ladies.

08:56.888 --> 09:00.016
You sure, missus? Is plenty space.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.988
<i>No. Gracias.</i>

09:02.160 --> 09:04.390
Okay.

09:10.035 --> 09:12.265
Ha. How's that for bread and roses?

09:14.005 --> 09:15.063
That was pretty sad.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.232
What's sad is now nobody re-stocks
the machine in the bathroom...

09:18.410 --> 09:20.173
so I have to make my own tampons.

09:20.345 --> 09:23.075
I don't know what that is.
That's where my yarn's going.

09:23.248 --> 09:26.513
Exactly, and so I say, no union.

09:26.685 --> 09:28.277
Yes, confederacy forever.

09:28.453 --> 09:32.014
No, wait, uh-uh. Don't listen to
the makes-her-own-tampons person.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.590
Listen to your hearts.
Because deep down...

09:34.759 --> 09:36.693
you know they're exploiting us.

09:36.861 --> 09:39.921
But if we unite, we can put a stop to it.

09:40.098 --> 09:43.192
And that supply closet
is just packed with posterboard...

09:43.368 --> 09:46.098
and markers,
and maybe even some glitter.

09:46.271 --> 09:48.205
So who's with me on that picket line?

09:50.875 --> 09:53.105
- And me.
- Really?

09:53.278 --> 09:55.371
You had me at "put."

09:55.547 --> 09:57.879
Yes, we need a sound sensor. Duh!

09:58.516 --> 10:01.417
Where is that equipment guy?
And where the hell are the jumars?

10:01.586 --> 10:03.816
Yeah, I don't know,
this was all I could find.

10:03.989 --> 10:05.980
I'm thinking goggles, yes. Shovels...

10:06.157 --> 10:07.590
I don't know how
or why we'd use them.

10:07.759 --> 10:09.488
- Ugh.
Cheryl?

10:09.661 --> 10:12.494
- She's not in here.
- Well, why are you in here?

10:12.664 --> 10:14.996
Is the San Marino diamond in here now?

10:15.166 --> 10:16.497
It might be, for all we know.

10:16.668 --> 10:18.329
We can't find any gear we need.

10:18.503 --> 10:20.903
We've got no sat-coms, no new intel...

10:21.072 --> 10:24.337
and so basically we are totally
unprepared for this mission.

10:24.509 --> 10:27.967
- Unless it involves night-shoveling.
- Well, I want that diamond.

10:28.146 --> 10:32.674
Not to mention my rapidly-approaching-
room-temperature Cobb salad, so...

10:32.851 --> 10:35.046
Damn it, where the hell are all the drones?

10:35.220 --> 10:37.450
<i>What do we want?
Unfair!</i>

10:37.622 --> 10:39.487
<i>When do we want it?
Change!</i>

10:39.657 --> 10:43.252
Okay, so they're bad chanters,
but overall this strike's shaping up.

10:43.428 --> 10:47.762
- How? Nobody knows why we're striking.
- Well, we can't say "Hey, right upstairs...

10:47.932 --> 10:49.797
is a top-secret intelligence agency."

10:49.968 --> 10:52.129
But it looks like we're
picketing the cleaners.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.930
- No, it doesn't.
- Jesus!

10:54.105 --> 10:56.403
Stop picketing the cleaners!

10:56.574 --> 10:57.973
You were saying?

10:58.143 --> 11:01.601
- Why are people picketing the cleaners?
- I predicted this. It's curry fury.

11:01.780 --> 11:03.338
Holy shit, is that Cyril?

11:03.515 --> 11:06.814
And Pam, Krieger, Carol. All the...

11:06.985 --> 11:10.546
Drones. They're not picketing
the cleaners, they're picketing ISIS.

11:10.722 --> 11:14.158
- What's their beef?
- Oh, the same entitled crap as always.

11:14.325 --> 11:17.158
"I can't make ends meet,"
"I'm on food stamps."

11:17.328 --> 11:20.559
"My child died because I couldn't
afford new bone marrow."

11:20.732 --> 11:23.292
- Just me, me, me.
- Jesus, whose kid died?

11:23.468 --> 11:25.698
Oh, who remembers. Check Pam's blog.

11:25.870 --> 11:29.237
And done, but if you still want us
to steal you that gigantic diamond...

11:29.407 --> 11:32.740
- Well, obviously.
- We're gonna have to cross their picket line.

11:34.212 --> 11:36.305
- Screw that.
- Yeah, what's with all the bottles?

11:36.481 --> 11:38.472
It's like a trailer park Easter.

11:38.650 --> 11:41.551
Lousy commies! Go back to Quebec!

11:41.719 --> 11:44.347
Jesus. Okay, strike's over, everybody.

11:44.522 --> 11:47.218
No, hold that line. We deserve a raise...

11:47.392 --> 11:50.418
and Lana deserves a real ring, so...

11:50.595 --> 11:51.789
Okay, so let's go out the back.

11:53.131 --> 11:54.723
- Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha!

11:54.899 --> 11:57.094
- Happy Easter, Cyril.
- Lana?

11:57.268 --> 11:59.532
Oh, baby. What happened to you?

11:59.704 --> 12:02.229
- Well, see, I wanted to buy you a...
- Cyril.

12:02.407 --> 12:05.638
- This is not that moment.
- And we don't talk to management.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.937
- Or ham-fisted whores.
- What?

12:08.113 --> 12:09.444
- Hmm?
- Yeah, no, they're right.

12:09.614 --> 12:12.447
- What?
- No, not the whore part. Management.

12:12.617 --> 12:14.107
We're not technically management.

12:14.285 --> 12:16.276
But you make shitloads more than we do.

12:16.454 --> 12:18.445
Even though you totally depend on us.

12:18.623 --> 12:22.753
On you? Hey, we're out
there risking our lives every...

12:22.927 --> 12:26.294
- Many of the days.
- And so, yes, we get paid a little more.

12:26.464 --> 12:28.728
- How much a little more?
- Well, it's complicated.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.391
- No, it isn't, don't answer that.
- What with salary...

12:31.569 --> 12:33.400
performance incentives, bonuses...

12:33.571 --> 12:35.402
- Bonuses?
- Dump her, Cyril.

12:35.573 --> 12:37.632
Hey, crazy. Go macrame some tampons.

12:37.809 --> 12:40.300
Oh, you wanna hear
something crazy? Cyril...

12:40.478 --> 12:43.470
- Thank you, Pam. Now look, Lana...
- Baby, "Take Charge" Cyril...

12:43.648 --> 12:47.482
is totally doing it for me, it really is,
but we're on a vital mission here.

12:47.652 --> 12:50.485
- Vital mission?
- Not on the master clipboard.

12:50.655 --> 12:53.317
- So just how vital is it?
It's incredibly vital.

12:53.491 --> 12:56.153
Because if they don't
steal me that huge diamond...

12:56.327 --> 12:59.091
I will literally die.
- A diamond?

12:59.264 --> 13:02.597
- In this economy?
- You're stealing a diamond? For her?

13:02.767 --> 13:05.361
- Oh, irony.
- And the rest of you, back to work.

13:05.537 --> 13:07.300
If that salad isn't open in the next...

13:07.472 --> 13:09.997
- Get them!
- Oh, oh!

13:10.175 --> 13:11.642
- Hey, whoa.
- Stop surging.

13:11.809 --> 13:13.003
Archer, do something.

13:13.178 --> 13:15.476
I am doing something.
What are you doing?

13:17.382 --> 13:19.213
Lana, out the back. Move.

13:19.384 --> 13:20.874
Hey, Cyril.

13:21.052 --> 13:22.519
Cyril.

13:22.687 --> 13:23.915
- Cyril!
What?

13:24.088 --> 13:28.752
I'm saving Lana. As usual.
Hey, shut up.

13:33.765 --> 13:36.529
Freaking ODIN. I can't believe this.
How many are there?

13:36.701 --> 13:38.100
About a jillion.
Damn it.

13:38.269 --> 13:40.567
- A jillion gay little copycats.
- What?

13:40.738 --> 13:42.763
I didn't invent the turtleneck, Lana.

13:42.941 --> 13:46.342
But I was the first to recognize
its potential as a tactical garment.

13:46.511 --> 13:48.411
- The tactical turtleneck, Lana.
- Archer.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.047
The Tactleneck.

13:50.215 --> 13:52.206
- Can you please focus?
- Not really.

13:52.383 --> 13:54.783
Don't think these goggles
were properly calibrated.

13:54.953 --> 13:58.013
Ditto the sound sensor.
And the stupid code-cloner.

13:58.189 --> 14:00.953
All the gear those sweaty
tech-dweebs normally... Oh!

14:01.125 --> 14:04.617
- Do we take the drones for granted?
- No. No, no, Lana.

14:04.796 --> 14:06.525
Do not make this about them.

14:06.698 --> 14:10.156
No, no, no. That is utterly unacceptable.

14:10.335 --> 14:13.827
- It's just a cost-of-living adjustment.
It's strong-arm robbery.

14:14.005 --> 14:16.838
Come on, Ms. Archer.
You've been in there ten hours.

14:17.008 --> 14:19.568
Meet us halfway,
and Krieger will let you out of there.

14:19.744 --> 14:22.838
- Or else he'll crank up the heat again.
I love...

14:23.014 --> 14:26.575
that you know how to do that.
- And I love that I have an erection...

14:26.751 --> 14:28.616
that didn't involve homeless people.

14:28.786 --> 14:32.153
And you're cool with Krieger
shucking your side-corn?

14:32.323 --> 14:34.348
Yeah, that is a huge win-win for me.

14:34.525 --> 14:35.924
You hear that, Ms. Archer?

14:36.094 --> 14:38.892
We're all on board
for the big win-win out here.

14:39.063 --> 14:41.531
Well, I'm not. Do your worst, Krieger.

14:41.699 --> 14:44.099
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, yes.

14:44.269 --> 14:46.362
Yes, go ahead. Crank up the heat.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.698
I'm as naked as the day I was born.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.838
Oh, yes.
That is not something...

14:52.043 --> 14:54.034
- Naked or not.
- Well, don't keep saying it.

14:54.212 --> 14:56.407
You can't stay in there forever.

14:56.581 --> 15:00.381
Ha! I'll outlast you.
I'm naked and I've got half a lime...

15:00.551 --> 15:01.711
and almost...

15:03.087 --> 15:05.078
nearly two-thirds of a half-gallon of...

15:07.358 --> 15:09.223
Shit.
- Now we got her.

15:09.394 --> 15:12.488
Ha! I'll suck it straight
off this grimy linoleum...

15:12.664 --> 15:14.564
before I give in to you belly-achers.

15:14.732 --> 15:19.135
- You've got nothing!
- No code-cloner, no GPS. Argh!

15:19.304 --> 15:21.363
- We've got no thermal imaging.
- Lana...

15:21.539 --> 15:23.131
we don't need gadgets.
- Really?

15:23.308 --> 15:26.436
Machines are gonna fail.
Then the system's gonna fail...

15:26.611 --> 15:29.375
and then it's
"Who has the ability to survive?"

15:29.547 --> 15:32.710
And that's the game, Lana. Survival.

15:33.651 --> 15:35.380
<i>Just watched Deliverance again, huh?</i>

15:35.553 --> 15:38.044
I mean, is Burt Reynolds
not the man in that?

15:38.222 --> 15:41.953
On the raft? With the vest?

15:42.660 --> 15:45.288
- Huh? You know he did all his own stunts.
- I know!

15:45.463 --> 15:47.226
- Shh!
- He did his own stunts!

15:47.398 --> 15:49.389
Keep your freaking voice... Aah!

15:49.567 --> 15:52.331
God! Sweet Jesus, the goggles!

15:52.503 --> 15:53.936
Intruders. Get them.

15:55.340 --> 15:59.436
- Aah, Lana! Lana, I'm blind. I'm blind.
- Yeah? Should I go on without you?

15:59.610 --> 16:02.841
What? No, carry me, monster-hands.

16:07.018 --> 16:08.918
Ow, ow, ow!

16:09.087 --> 16:10.850
Jesus. Quit bouncing my eyes.

16:11.022 --> 16:14.185
Shut up. I'm trying to get us
an evac but nobody's answer...

16:14.359 --> 16:16.691
Oh, holy shit, are they still on strike?

16:16.861 --> 16:19.830
Hey, Eugene Debs,
it's only been about ten hours.

16:19.997 --> 16:22.090
- All right?
- So you'd rather die in there...

16:22.266 --> 16:25.326
than give us a cost-of-living
adjustment?

16:25.970 --> 16:28.803
Yes.
- Well, I can arrange that.

16:28.973 --> 16:30.304
Crunch!

16:30.475 --> 16:32.272
I love that you know how to do that.

16:32.443 --> 16:34.308
Well, now you're trapped. Happy?

16:35.680 --> 16:38.012
Yes.
- Ugh! Laundry.

16:38.182 --> 16:39.649
Oh, wait, are we open?

16:39.817 --> 16:41.375
What? Sir, you have to slow...

16:41.552 --> 16:43.349
Jeezy Petes, get a load of this guy.

16:43.521 --> 16:46.854
<i>We're taking heavy
fire and we need an extraction, dumb-ass!</i>

16:47.024 --> 16:48.150
Lana?

16:48.326 --> 16:51.625
<i>Ha! She thought you were a man.
Shut up. Cyril, baby...</i>

16:51.796 --> 16:53.627
<i>... we're pinned down, okay?
We need a... Aah!</i>

16:53.798 --> 16:55.356
- Lana!
What's going on?

16:55.533 --> 16:57.728
<i>We need evac. A helo, a jump-jet.</i>

16:57.902 --> 16:59.893
<i>At this point, really anything.</i>

17:00.071 --> 17:03.006
Don't just stand there, idiots.
- Yeah, come on. Get them out of there.

17:03.174 --> 17:05.642
Uh, we need the sat-com link to do that.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.573
- So?
- So it's upstairs.

17:07.744 --> 17:11.078
And, uh, someone broke the elevator.

17:11.249 --> 17:14.650
And Miss Fire Hazard in there
bricked up the only stairwell.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.810
Don't talk to me about fire hazards.

17:16.988 --> 17:20.617
<i>- All you people did in there was smoke.
Oh, God, I'm hit.</i>

17:20.791 --> 17:23.420
<i>Lana!
- Will somebody please do something?</i>

17:23.594 --> 17:26.757
<i>Like what, Cyril? I'm blind.
- No, us. Here.</i>

17:26.931 --> 17:28.364
<i>Oh.
- Krieger, Bilbo.</i>

17:28.532 --> 17:30.262
Come on,
can't you guys do something?

17:30.435 --> 17:32.460
Wha...? No.

17:33.137 --> 17:34.502
Oh, wait, I meant yes.

17:36.774 --> 17:39.334
Roger that, Zebra-Two. Stand by.

17:39.510 --> 17:42.479
Helo's 10-4, just needs you
to upload their GPS coordinates...

17:42.647 --> 17:43.841
into his HUD.

17:44.015 --> 17:46.643
Which I will do with these cell phones.

17:46.818 --> 17:48.752
Holy shit, you geeks are bad-ass.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.548
We couldn't have done it
without an electrical insulator.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.213
So thank Cyril
for the tiny brown diamond.

17:54.392 --> 17:56.292
<i>What?
Wait, did we get the diamond?</i>

17:56.461 --> 17:59.362
<i>What? No. But Cyril,
why did you have a diamond?</i>

17:59.530 --> 18:02.966
Oh, uh, just my ear-stud.
You know, from college.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.263
<i>Really?
Called it.</i>

18:05.436 --> 18:08.701
And, again, you do realize
it'll be totally destroyed in the process.

18:08.873 --> 18:10.500
Yes, just hurry up. Please.

18:10.675 --> 18:14.611
Okay, uploading GPS coordinates.

18:14.779 --> 18:17.247
<i>- Wait a second.
Damn it, we don't have a second.</i>

18:17.415 --> 18:19.178
<i>Lana, I'm sure we have one second.</i>

18:19.350 --> 18:22.376
<i>But seriously, it does sound like
we're about to be overrun, so...</i>

18:22.553 --> 18:25.886
Get my son out of there.
What the hell are you people waiting for?

18:26.057 --> 18:29.390
<i>- A goddamn cost-of-living adjustment.
What?</i>

18:29.560 --> 18:31.118
- Hey, yeah.
- No!

18:31.295 --> 18:34.389
- Krieger, this is not the time for this.
- It is exactly the time.

18:34.565 --> 18:36.499
So, what's it gonna be, you harpy?

18:36.667 --> 18:39.397
You ever wanna see your son again?

18:40.404 --> 18:41.962
Not at the number you quoted me.

18:42.139 --> 18:43.663
<i>Mother!
- That number is pegged...</i>

18:43.841 --> 18:45.331
to the consumer price index.

18:45.510 --> 18:47.842
Where? The People's Republic of Canada?

18:48.012 --> 18:50.537
<i>Jesus, take it out of our bonuses.
What?</i>

18:50.715 --> 18:52.808
<i>Mother, no, listen to me. Aah!</i>

18:52.984 --> 18:55.282
<i>I'm hit. I'm hit and I'm blind.</i>

18:55.453 --> 18:58.479
Jesus, Ms. Archer, your child is dying.

18:58.656 --> 19:01.784
Oh, all right.
If they'll give up their bonuses...

19:01.959 --> 19:03.893
<i>Mother!
You can have your lousy...</i>

19:04.061 --> 19:05.426
cost-of-living adjustment.

19:07.131 --> 19:08.598
Something good's happening.

19:08.766 --> 19:10.791
And you can have your dick son back.

19:15.306 --> 19:17.171
<i>What's going on?
I hear a helicopter.</i>

19:17.341 --> 19:19.036
<i>- Oh, yeah.
Holy shit...</i>

19:19.210 --> 19:23.044
<i>...my other senses are already heightened.
- Hey, this time I saved Lana.</i>

19:23.214 --> 19:27.378
- But... Oh, God, Pam. Two months' salary.
- Cyril.

19:27.552 --> 19:29.850
You can't put a price on good pussy.

19:30.021 --> 19:33.513
Roger that, Zebra Two.
Hey, the helo's got them. They're safe.

19:33.691 --> 19:35.454
Hooray.
Way to go.

19:35.626 --> 19:38.186
Then get me out of this sweat-box!

19:42.199 --> 19:45.498
Because I am officially out of gin.

19:47.438 --> 19:50.407
Oh, come on, Archer, not now, I'm serious.

19:50.575 --> 19:51.872
Hey, I'm serious!

19:52.043 --> 19:53.806
Look at me, seriously, Lana.

19:53.978 --> 19:57.277
Forget the eye bandage, but the hair,
the strong jaw line.

19:57.448 --> 19:58.972
- Who do I remind you of?
- Nobody.

19:59.150 --> 20:00.617
- Say it.
- Don't make me do that.

20:00.785 --> 20:02.753
- Say it. Say it!
- Ugh.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.184
<i>Burt Reynolds in Deliverance.</i>

20:05.356 --> 20:08.484
<i>No! Not in Deliverance.
Ha, ha.</i>

20:08.659 --> 20:10.524
<i>- In Gator.
- Ugh.</i>

20:10.695 --> 20:12.219
Right?

20:14.065 --> 20:15.999
How can you not see that?
