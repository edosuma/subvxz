&lrm;the prince breaks the spell

00:34.240 --> 00:35.560
&lrm;Who can tell us why?

00:35.720 --> 00:38.440
&lrm;Because only love can conquer hate.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.880
&lrm;[Mrs. Bustier] Correct.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.160
&lrm;Technically,

00:41.320 --> 00:44.960
&lrm;[Max continues]
&lrm;this is only true in 87% of cases.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.840
&lrm;Thank you, Max.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.120
&lrm;Adrien, I hope that's about my lesson.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.480
&lrm;What did I just say?

00:51.640 --> 00:54.280
&lrm;The prince breaks the spell by
&lrm;kissing the princess

00:54.440 --> 00:55.600
&lrm;because love conquers hate.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.840

&lrm;Don't forget to finish <i>&lrm;Sleeping Beauty</i>&lrm;.

&lrm;Happy Valentine's day.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.760
&lrm;I'll meet you outside.

01:04.920 --> 01:05.960
&lrm;OK.

&lrm;[he sighs]

01:16.160 --> 01:17.320
&lrm;[she chuckles]

01:18.800 --> 01:20.640
&lrm;Hi, Adrien. Sign here, please.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.080
&lrm;You know I hate signing autographs.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.960
&lrm;That's not what this is.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.360
&lrm;It's a petition
&lrm;against cruelty to hamsters.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.280
&lrm;Have you seen the sweaters
&lrm;they're forced to wear?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.680
&lrm;[he sighs]

01:34.880 --> 01:35.920
&lrm;[they gasp]

01:36.080 --> 01:37.200
&lrm;[Chloe giggles]

01:40.360 --> 01:43.560
&lrm;Well, well, Marinette,
&lrm;looking for something to eat?

01:43.720 --> 01:45.720
&lrm;Maybe she's looking
&lrm;for better clothes.

01:45.880 --> 01:46.920
&lrm;[they giggle]

01:47.360 --> 01:48.440
&lrm;[she growls]

01:48.600 --> 01:49.960
&lrm;Ignore them.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.560
&lrm;They're not worth it.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.920
&lrm;You're right.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.520
&lrm;"Your hair is dark as night,
&lrm;Your pretty bluebell eyes.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.040
&lrm;I wonder who you are
&lrm;Beneath that strong disguise.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.160
&lrm;Every day we see each other,
&lrm;I hope that you'll be mine.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.000
&lrm;Together our love could be so true,
&lrm;Please be my Valentine."

02:05.160 --> 02:07.040
&lrm;Wow, now that's a love poem.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.720
&lrm;Who could it be to?

02:08.880 --> 02:11.000
&lrm;"Hair dark as night",
&lrm;"Bluebell eyes"?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.280
&lrm;Well... you.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.120
&lrm;[giggling]
&lrm;No way.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.000
&lrm;There are plenty of girls at school
&lrm;with dark hair and blue eyes.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.640
&lrm;Yes, but bluebell eyes?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.840
&lrm;What does he mean by "strong disguise"?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.120
&lrm;[Tikki sighs]

02:24.280 --> 02:27.360
&lrm;This is poetry.
&lrm;He means who you are deep down.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.520
&lrm;He wants to get to know you.
&lrm;He's talking about you.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.440
&lrm;[she squeals with delight]
&lrm;Pinch me.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.120
&lrm;[shrieking]
&lrm;Not literally!

02:37.400 --> 02:38.800
&lrm;[Tikki giggles]

02:43.680 --> 02:45.920
&lrm;Operation Valentine's Day
&lrm;is commencing.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.760
&lrm;According to my research
&lrm;of shopping sites,

02:48.920 --> 02:51.880
&lrm;this jewel was ranked
&lrm;highest in popularity.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.160
&lrm;Perfect. I'll hit a homerun
&lrm;with this one.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.640
&lrm;Love is like baseball, right?
&lrm;You need a strategy.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.680
&lrm;And if you aim right,
&lrm;it's a homerun.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.920
&lrm;-Great metaphor, Kim.
&lrm;-Meta who?

03:06.080 --> 03:08.200
&lrm;Wow, sparkly. Is that for me?

03:09.560 --> 03:11.920
&lrm;No, Alya,
&lrm;it's for someone else, it's...

03:12.080 --> 03:13.920
&lrm;Shh! Keep quiet.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.120
&lrm;Scoop! Kim's got a crush.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.000
&lrm;Who's the lucky lady?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.400
&lrm;It's gorgeous, Kim. She'll be ecstatic.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.920
&lrm;She's still gotta accept it.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.240
&lrm;-What if she says no?
&lrm;-She won't.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.360
&lrm;No way, don't hold back.
&lrm;Go for it. No regrets!

03:29.520 --> 03:32.080
&lrm;Operation Valentine's Day
&lrm;is underway.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.680
&lrm;Her route is in yellow, yours is in red.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.880
&lrm;If you run at 10mph,
&lrm;you'll have a 4-minute lead on her.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.000
&lrm;Wait here. It's the 3rd
&lrm;most romantic spot in Paris.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.800
&lrm;-Go, go!
&lrm;-Thanks, guys.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.880
&lrm;I know someone who's good
&lrm;at giving advice,

03:48.040 --> 03:49.640
&lrm;but who can't take any.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.000
&lrm;Let's go.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.480
&lrm;You're right. It's time I told him.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.880
&lrm;Say what?

03:57.040 --> 03:59.840
&lrm;I'm gonna tell him my true feelings.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.720
&lrm;Well, I'll write them,
&lrm;on a card.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.480
&lrm;Yeah.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.960
&lrm;Yeah.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.080
&lrm;OPERATION VALENTINE'S DAY!

04:08.400 --> 04:09.640
&lrm;[they giggle]

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
&lrm;[admiring sighs]

04:11.560 --> 04:12.880
&lrm;Wow, he's so cute.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.240
&lrm;Keep dreaming, girls,
&lrm;but the boy is mine.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.040
&lrm;[gasping]

04:19.360 --> 04:21.920
&lrm;"To Chloe, the most awesome girl
&lrm;in the world,

&lrm;[sobbing]

04:27.600 --> 04:29.760
&lrm;[Chloe] She's not crying enough.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.560
&lrm;[Marinette]
<i>&lrm;"Dear, Adrien"... "Dear, Adrien"</i>

04:37.960 --> 04:39.640
&lrm;"Dear Adrien"

04:40.320 --> 04:43.080
&lrm;I'm no good at this
&lrm;love-letter writing thing.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.040
&lrm;I sound like a dorkasaurus.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.440
&lrm;[she whines]

04:46.600 --> 04:49.600
&lrm;Only when you say
&lrm;words like "dorkasaurus".

04:49.760 --> 04:52.480
&lrm;Relax, Marinette, I'm teasing.
&lrm;Think of Adrien

04:52.640 --> 04:54.000
&lrm;and speak from the heart.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.600
&lrm;[she gasps]

04:56.760 --> 04:57.880
&lrm;Adrien's letter.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.120
&lrm;Why didn't I think of that before?
&lrm;I'll answer his poem.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.560
&lrm;[Alya] Marinette?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.880
&lrm;Check... it... out!

05:06.400 --> 05:07.840
&lrm;It's perfect.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.920
&lrm;Oh, thank you, thank you.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.400
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

05:17.320 --> 05:18.640
&lrm;[Ayla gasps excitedly]

05:18.800 --> 05:19.880
<i>&lrm;Voilà.</i>

05:20.040 --> 05:22.160
&lrm;Don't forget to sign it.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.800
&lrm;[Alya] It's a good omen.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.720
&lrm;Ladybugs are good luck,
&lrm;especially in the love department.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.000
&lrm;Really?

05:30.160 --> 05:33.240
&lrm;Yeah, you of all people
&lrm;should know about ladybugs.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.880
&lrm;Wh-Why do you say that?

05:36.040 --> 05:38.200
&lrm;"The ladybug is a symbol of love,

05:38.360 --> 05:40.760
&lrm;guiding hearts on the paths of devotion."

05:40.920 --> 05:42.760
&lrm;It's on my blog. Didn't you read it?

05:43.200 --> 05:45.160
&lrm;Yes, of course.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.040
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

05:47.400 --> 05:49.480
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;So, she's got eyes, arms, legs...

05:49.640 --> 05:51.520
&lrm;Big deal.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.600
&lrm;How can you be in love with Ladybug?
&lrm;You don't even know who she is.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.960
&lrm;You know nothing about love.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.240
&lrm;Sure I do. I love cheddar, Swiss...

06:00.400 --> 06:02.320
&lrm;and I love camembert.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.040
&lrm;[he sighs]

06:08.120 --> 06:09.560
&lrm;The poor boy's frustrated

06:09.720 --> 06:12.320
&lrm;because he can't finish the poem
&lrm;for his masked sweetheart.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.320
&lrm;I don't need a poem.
&lrm;I can tell her to her face.

06:15.480 --> 06:16.560
&lrm;I love you.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.360
&lrm;[disgusted]
&lrm;That's gross.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.840
&lrm;You're making me lose my appetite.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.960
&lrm;[munching]
&lrm;Almost.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.480
&lrm;[Chloe] That's right,

06:28.640 --> 06:29.920
&lrm;in a 24-carat frame.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.280
&lrm;Deliver it to Le Grand Paris Hotel
&lrm;and bill it to daddy.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.520
&lrm;I mean Mr. Bourgeois.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.880
&lrm;What are you doing here?

06:38.040 --> 06:39.320
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;I-I...

06:39.480 --> 06:40.960
&lrm;You... you...

06:41.120 --> 06:41.960
&lrm;[he coughs]

06:43.160 --> 06:45.760
&lrm;Will you... be my Valentine?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.360
&lrm;[bell rings]

06:47.520 --> 06:48.880
&lrm;[he sighs]

06:50.880 --> 06:51.720
&lrm;Don't move.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.440
&lrm;[she laughs]

06:55.600 --> 06:57.080
&lrm;Wait till people see this.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.560
&lrm;No offence, Kim, my heart's saved
&lrm;for someone more awesome.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.280
&lrm;Don't you just hate
&lrm;how harsh love can be?

07:04.440 --> 07:05.800
&lrm;[she laughs]

07:05.960 --> 07:07.240
&lrm;[he sighs]

07:09.120 --> 07:12.200
&lrm;[he sobs]

07:15.040 --> 07:16.920
&lrm;Valentine's Day,

07:17.080 --> 07:20.040
&lrm;the day of love and the day of fools.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.320
&lrm;So many delusions,
&lrm;so much disappointment.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.800
&lrm;My evil Akumas,

07:25.960 --> 07:29.080
&lrm;you are going to have
&lrm;such a field-day.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.520
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,

07:32.680 --> 07:34.520
&lrm;and evilise him.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.480
&lrm;Dark Cupid, I am Hawk Moth.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.680
&lrm;I can give you the power

07:51.840 --> 07:55.160
&lrm;to shoot your arrows,
&lrm;pierce love and impale friendships.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.600
&lrm;But, there's something
&lrm;you must do for me in return.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.200
&lrm;No love affair
&lrm;or friendship will escape my fury.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.080
&lrm;No-one will love again!

08:20.640 --> 08:21.880
&lrm;[arrow whistles]

08:24.240 --> 08:26.800
&lrm;[she shrieks]

08:31.680 --> 08:32.840
&lrm;Stupid flowers.

08:34.559 --> 08:35.799
&lrm;Get off me!

08:40.000 --> 08:42.919
&lrm;[he cackles]

08:43.559 --> 08:45.440
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;Perfect.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.760
&lrm;Soon, Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will show up to meet their doom.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.120
&lrm;[evil laugh]

08:55.800 --> 08:57.560
&lrm;[giggling]

08:57.720 --> 08:59.160
&lrm;Candy-apples, girls?

08:59.320 --> 09:00.680
&lrm;Thanks, dad.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.960
&lrm;Come on, do it
&lrm;before you chicken out.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.600
&lrm;[they cheer]
&lrm;I did it.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.800
&lrm;[vibrating]

09:18.520 --> 09:19.520
&lrm;Chloe?

09:19.920 --> 09:22.000
&lrm;Since when did she start texting us?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.000
&lrm;[questioning sigh]
&lrm;[they gasp]

09:24.160 --> 09:25.280
&lrm;[Alya] What a witch!

09:25.560 --> 09:28.160
&lrm;And I was the one
&lrm;who told Kim to do it.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.840
&lrm;I didn't know he was talking about her.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.080
&lrm;I hope Adrien doesn't do that to you.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.840
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;I mean...

09:35.000 --> 09:36.400
&lrm;What have I done?

09:36.560 --> 09:39.360
&lrm;Girl, calm down.
&lrm;I was joking... kind of.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.280
&lrm;Adrien would never do that.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.880
&lrm;What is that?

09:47.560 --> 09:49.360
&lrm;All hearts must be destroyed!

09:49.680 --> 09:50.960
&lrm;[gasping]

09:51.120 --> 09:52.320
&lrm;Ayla?

09:52.480 --> 09:53.920
&lrm;Hey, seriously?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.880
&lrm;You're not my BFF. You're a joke!

09:57.040 --> 10:00.520
&lrm;Adrien will laugh his head off
&lrm;at your lame attempt at poetry.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.800
&lrm;[Ayla cackles]
&lrm;Alya?

10:02.960 --> 10:04.360
&lrm;What did he do to her?

10:07.480 --> 10:09.840
&lrm;I've seen that jewel before.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.200
&lrm;It's Kim's pin.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.640
&lrm;He's been akumatised.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.120
&lrm;[struggling]
&lrm;This is... not good.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.960
&lrm;We've gotta find him fast.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.480
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

10:48.760 --> 10:51.600
&lrm;[Chloe groans]
&lrm;I never said 18-carat gold.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.400
&lrm;The tones will never match
&lrm;my 24-carat toilet.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.400
&lrm;[Chloe] Idiots!

10:55.760 --> 10:58.000
&lrm;[he huffs]
&lrm;[bow stretches]

10:59.720 --> 11:00.760
&lrm;[gasping]

11:00.920 --> 11:02.560
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-Stop, Kim.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.720
&lrm;I'm not Kim,

11:03.880 --> 11:06.040
&lrm;I'm Dark Cupid. I'll never stop.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.440
&lrm;If I can't have love then no-one can.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.440
&lrm;OK, I get it. Chloe burned you.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.080
&lrm;You don't have to take it out
&lrm;on all of Paris.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.320
&lrm;Yes I do.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.480
&lrm;I won't stop till all hearts are crushed.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.840
&lrm;Say adios to your loved ones,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.240
&lrm;now you'll hate them.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.400
&lrm;[she screams]

11:41.680 --> 11:43.640
&lrm;If you want to continue
&lrm;destroying love,

11:43.800 --> 11:45.760
&lrm;bring me Ladybug's Miraculous.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.880
&lrm;or I'll remove your powers.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.320
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Fallen for me already?

11:55.480 --> 11:58.400
&lrm;-I need to talk to you.
&lrm;-It's gotta wait...

11:58.560 --> 11:59.640
&lrm;[he hushes her]

11:59.800 --> 12:02.560
&lrm;I swore I'd tell you
&lrm;as soon as I saw you.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.600
&lrm;Ladybug, I-I... Look out!

12:06.360 --> 12:07.240
&lrm;[arrow whistles]

12:07.880 --> 12:09.240
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;Cat Noir?

12:09.400 --> 12:11.520
&lrm;Ladybug, I...

12:11.680 --> 12:12.840
&lrm;I loathe you!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.760
&lrm;Cat Noir, snap out of it.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.720
&lrm;You're nothing to me, Ladybug,
&lrm;I hate you.

12:18.760 --> 12:19.960
&lrm;[he shrieks]

12:28.080 --> 12:30.800
&lrm;Ladybug, it's about time.
&lrm;Where have you been?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.840
&lrm;Offer to help him

12:42.000 --> 12:44.320
&lrm;in return for Ladybug's Miraculous.

12:44.960 --> 12:49.040
&lrm;I can help you crush Ladybug
&lrm;but you must give me her Miraculous.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.440
&lrm;No... problem.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.920
&lrm;[he cackles]

12:53.320 --> 12:55.200
&lrm;Yes... yes.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.680
&lrm;Once I have Ladybug's Miraculous,

12:58.840 --> 13:00.840
&lrm;taking Cat Noir's will be
&lrm;child's play!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.840
&lrm;You have to leave.
&lrm;Kim's turned into Dark Cupid.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.880
&lrm;He can't find you here.

13:06.040 --> 13:10.040
&lrm;Me? But how could he have
&lrm;a vendetta against me?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.720
&lrm;[whispering]
&lrm;Who doesn't?

13:11.880 --> 13:13.320
&lrm;It's because of this.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.640
&lrm;Everyone would love to have it.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.320
&lrm;That's Adrien,
&lrm;a super-hot guy in my class,

13:18.480 --> 13:21.240
&lrm;and rich too.
&lrm;He's hot for me, of course.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.120
&lrm;Not according to the poem.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.160
&lrm;[Sabrina shrieks]
&lrm;It's alive!

13:27.440 --> 13:28.480
&lrm;[screaming]

13:33.840 --> 13:35.480
&lrm;[Chloe screams]

13:35.640 --> 13:37.480
&lrm;[Marinette] Chloe, run!

13:40.560 --> 13:42.160
&lrm;Well, well, Ladybug.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.240
&lrm;I don't want to fight you.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.480
&lrm;That friendliness is so revolting.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.360
&lrm;You're not my friend.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.080
&lrm;[he yells]

14:06.120 --> 14:07.960
&lrm;Why are you so full of hate?

14:08.120 --> 14:09.720
&lrm;Because hate conquers all.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.560
&lrm;I hate to burst your bubble,

14:11.720 --> 14:14.960
&lrm;but hate doesn't conquer all,
&lrm;love does.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.200
&lrm;[she gasps]

14:16.360 --> 14:19.320
<i>&lrm;The prince breaks the spell</i>
<i>&lrm;by kissing the princess.</i>

14:19.480 --> 14:21.720
<i>&lrm;Only love conquers hate.</i>

14:21.880 --> 14:24.880
&lrm;You're just buying time....
&lrm;Fight!

14:26.680 --> 14:28.520
&lrm;I'll do better than that.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.000
&lrm;[he gasps]

14:31.600 --> 14:34.560
&lrm;Come on, kitty-kitty, just a peck.

14:35.960 --> 14:36.800
&lrm;Almost.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.680
&lrm;[he yells]
&lrm;Get back, you savage.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.680
&lrm;Here, kitty-kitty, come here.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.880
&lrm;[he cackles]

14:46.040 --> 14:47.640
&lrm;You can't outrun me.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.760
&lrm;[she screams]

14:49.920 --> 14:51.160
&lrm;Help.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.160
&lrm;[they scream]

14:55.120 --> 14:57.840
&lrm;Happy Valentine's Day, Chloe.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.880
&lrm;Now you'll get what you deserve.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.080
&lrm;[Chloe] My hair!

15:01.240 --> 15:04.440
&lrm;There's nothing worse
&lrm;than a bad-hair day.

15:04.600 --> 15:09.080
&lrm;First, Ladybug wrinkles my jacket,
&lrm;second, you totally ruined my hair.

15:09.240 --> 15:13.760
&lrm;Go ahead and change me.
&lrm;This day can't get any worse.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.800
&lrm;I don't need to waste
&lrm;my arrow on you.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.600
&lrm;Your heart is so dark and shrivelled
&lrm;there's no room for love.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.440
&lrm;[he laughs]

15:22.600 --> 15:24.880
&lrm;How dare you?

15:28.120 --> 15:31.280
&lrm;Why are you just standing there?
&lrm;Help me up!

15:31.440 --> 15:34.760
&lrm;You think I'd help someone
&lrm;as stuck up as you?

15:36.800 --> 15:38.280
&lrm;Wait till people see this.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.640
&lrm;[she cackles]

15:39.920 --> 15:40.920
&lrm;[she groans]

15:48.280 --> 15:49.360
&lrm;No, no!

15:49.520 --> 15:52.280
&lrm;I'm not looking forward to it either.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.240
&lrm;I can't believe I'm doing this.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.920
&lrm;[kissing]
&lrm;[he whimpers]

16:00.280 --> 16:02.280
&lrm;[explosions]

16:05.240 --> 16:08.040
&lrm;How you gonna fight
&lrm;both of us now, bug-eyes?

16:09.680 --> 16:11.560
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:16.360 --> 16:19.680
&lrm;I often wonder what
&lrm;my cataclysm will do to someone.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.760
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:27.480 --> 16:30.560
&lrm;A candy-apple?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with this?

16:30.840 --> 16:31.840
&lrm;Think, Ladybug.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.160
&lrm;Hey.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.920
&lrm;I've a Valentine's gift for you.

16:40.880 --> 16:41.960
&lrm;[they roar]

16:59.520 --> 17:01.960
&lrm;Looks like you're in a sticky situation.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.720
&lrm;[he groans]

17:10.640 --> 17:12.040
&lrm;Ladybug!

17:13.319 --> 17:15.440
&lrm;And now for the pussycat.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.000
&lrm;Cat Noir, her Miraculous.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.200
&lrm;With pleasure.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.880
&lrm;Finally, I'll find out who you are.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.240
&lrm;Your secret will be out of the bag.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.200
&lrm;[romantic music]

17:39.360 --> 17:41.560
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;Wh-What am I doing here?

17:43.120 --> 17:45.120
&lrm;No time, the quiver pin, Cat Noir, now!

17:45.800 --> 17:47.360
&lrm;[he yells]

17:47.520 --> 17:49.800
&lrm;[Ladybug] Grab the pin!

17:49.960 --> 17:52.040
&lrm;-No !
&lrm;-Sorry, need that.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.000
&lrm;Happy Valentine's Day.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.880
&lrm;You shouldn't have... Woops.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.760
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.560
&lrm;Time to de-evilise.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.200
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:13.480 --> 18:15.000
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.040
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.080
&lrm;What the heck am I doing?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.680
&lrm;What the heck are you doing?

18:26.320 --> 18:28.400
&lrm;[Sabrina] I-I have no idea.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.760
&lrm;[they sob]

18:33.920 --> 18:35.080
&lrm;POUND IT!

18:35.240 --> 18:36.520
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;Woops.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.000
&lrm;Wait, I gotta tell you something.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.920
&lrm;Look, the kiss...
&lrm;I had to break the spell.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.200
&lrm;What? A kiss? What kiss?

18:45.360 --> 18:47.360
&lrm;I just wanted to say...

18:48.160 --> 18:49.200
&lrm;Your ring's flashing.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.480
&lrm;Yours too.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.720
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;We're about to turn into pumpkins.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.800
&lrm;And I'd rather not see that.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.320
&lrm;[he roars]

19:00.480 --> 19:02.200
&lrm;Blasted Ladybug!

19:02.680 --> 19:05.560
&lrm;Blasted Valentine's Day!

19:13.320 --> 19:16.440
&lrm;Hey, there's your chance
&lrm;to get your card back.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.000
&lrm;-That was before.
&lrm;-Before what?

19:19.160 --> 19:22.960
&lrm;I realised that even with
&lrm;all this hate, love still wins.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.320
&lrm;If I wanna win-over Adrien,
&lrm;he needs to know the truth.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.680
&lrm;This is a big day.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.040
&lrm;[Plagg laughs]

19:31.200 --> 19:35.400
&lrm;Can you believe all the horrible,
&lrm;thoughtless things you said?

19:36.360 --> 19:38.280
&lrm;You think it's funny?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.280
&lrm;[Plagg] What's the big deal?

19:40.440 --> 19:43.960
&lrm;You've got so many cards
&lrm;from all these lady-fans,

19:44.120 --> 19:45.640
&lrm;just take your pick.

19:48.400 --> 19:53.760
&lrm;[mysterious music]

19:53.920 --> 19:57.360
&lrm;Someone answered my poem?
&lrm;But I threw it away.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.560
&lrm;"Your hair shines like the sun,
&lrm;Your eyes are gorgeous green,

20:00.720 --> 20:03.800
&lrm;I look at you and wonder,
&lrm;Your innermost thoughts and dreams.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.720
&lrm;Your Valentine, I will be,
&lrm;Our love will be so true,

20:06.880 --> 20:09.440
&lrm;Together for eternity,
&lrm;My heart belongs to you."

20:09.600 --> 20:12.040
&lrm;Anyone who writes
&lrm;as sickeningly sweet as you

20:12.200 --> 20:14.200
&lrm;must be your soulmate.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.040
&lrm;It isn't signed.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.160
&lrm;Could it have come from Ladybug?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.480
&lrm;Oh, please.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.640
&lrm;What? You don't remember?
&lrm;Did you sign it or not?

20:40.800 --> 20:41.920
&lrm;I don't know.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.200
&lrm;The ladybug came while I was writing.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.680
&lrm;Then you were yapping about your blog.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.200
&lrm;It's all a blur.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.480
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;I don't believe you.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.000
&lrm;The girl didn't even sign it!

20:54.160 --> 20:57.280
&lrm;I love you,
&lrm;but sometimes, you seriously bug.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.920
&lrm;You know that, right?

20:59.080 --> 21:01.320
&lrm;[they giggle]
