to you, too.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.109
I'm sorry.
I'm just --

00:10.111 --> 00:12.277
I'm really nervous about
this closing argument today.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.279
Is it because you've lost
three cases in a row?

00:14.281 --> 00:16.448
Whispering it doesn't make it
any less painful.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.616
Sorry.
Okay.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.118
No, it's just
that this case --

00:19.120 --> 00:21.620
It's so hard to hold
the jury's attention.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.655
Well, do you want
to run your argument by <i> me?</i>

00:23.657 --> 00:24.723
Could I?
Sure.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.058
Um, okay.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.394
Six years ago,
alger equities took investments

00:28.396 --> 00:30.629
From municipal pension funds
and private investors

00:30.631 --> 00:32.231
And funneled all of that
into offshore --

00:32.232 --> 00:33.799
And I've already
lost you.

00:33.801 --> 00:37.069
No. I was just thinking --
because it's Halloween,

00:37.071 --> 00:39.138
What if you wore these
in the courtroom?

the costume contest.

Hey, now, honey,
it's not important if you win.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.987
It's just for fun.
Picture.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.989
But it's more fun
if you win.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.090
No offense, daddy.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.092
You know, lily's been
letting me know recently

01:00.094 --> 01:01.493
That she's feeling
neglected.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.595
I think it's because
of all my football stuff.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.431
That's why I went all out
on her costume.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.766
Look how incredibly accurate
it is.

he stares at it,

Cam cannot find waldo.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.176
It's crazy.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.278
O-once, he pointed
to a barber pole,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.780
And we just gave it
to him.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.949
Where is the little guy?

01:23.951 --> 01:25.184
He's right there.

Ay, thank you.
I am princess fiona.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.811
So does that make me
a prince?

Do I have to keep track
of a crown all night?

01:54.315 --> 01:55.914
No, you're shrek,

01:55.916 --> 01:57.316
You mean
that big green thing?

Nah, I don't want
to walk around all night

01:59.320 --> 02:01.253
With an ugly
rubber mask.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.822
No. You just need to paint
your face green, and that's it.

Ouch.
Yeah, ouch.

Well, you never want to go
shopping with me for costumes,

02:16.103 --> 02:18.937
So I get what I want,
and you are what comes with it.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.839
Well, this year,
I'm getting my own costume,

02:20.841 --> 02:22.341
And it's gonna be
tough and manly --

02:22.343 --> 02:24.943
Maybe a cowboy
or a construction worker.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.880
You know that that's what mitch
and cam wore last year, right?

02:30.083 --> 02:31.750
Ow! Damn it!
I cut my finger!

02:31.752 --> 02:33.785

Wow.
That looks great.

to make the blood?

Ooh! Great production value,

lives were destroyed,

03:52.499 --> 03:57.736
And careers, once so promising,
were now...Ruined.

of this marriage,

I hate it when people
assume things about me

You use Halloween as a way
to show people you have edge.

Yeah.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.923
You think
that would work for me?

16:31.925 --> 16:33.424
It could.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.960
But you might want
a second opinion

16:59.853 --> 17:02.553
Because

You went out and bought costumes
for all of us,

You were singing.
