[theme music]

00:05.080 --> 00:08.109
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.130 --> 00:12.060
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.009
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.029 --> 00:17.120
They were good.

00:17.140 --> 00:20.030
[music continues]

00:22.070 --> 00:26.079
Then there was Gargamel
the evil wizard.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.079
Ooh! I hate Smurfs!

00:31.120 --> 00:33.219
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.000 --> 00:36.049
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.060
[evil laugh]

00:38.079 --> 00:39.140
[Gargamel grunts]

00:39.159 --> 00:41.100
Oh! I'll get you.

00:41.119 --> 00:44.210
'I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.'

00:44.229 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
and if you listen,
you may here Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.229
And if you are good,
you may just

00:54.009 --> 00:56.189
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:00.049 --> 01:02.179
[theme music]

01:05.049 --> 01:07.180
[instrumental music]

01:16.030 --> 01:18.200
Ah! A sight for smurf eyes.

01:18.219 --> 01:21.210
All my little Smurfs
busy at harvest time.

01:25.030 --> 01:26.090
'Lazy!'

01:26.109 --> 01:30.000
What.. Ah, ah!
Oh, coming, Papa Smurf.

01:30.019 --> 01:31.150
thud

01:31.170 --> 01:33.079
screech

01:33.099 --> 01:35.170
Why aren't you helping
with the harvest?

01:35.189 --> 01:38.069
Oh, well, I-I was going to,
Papa Smurf.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.079
But, I-I had this
terrible smurf-ache.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.200
Uh, m-my back hurts.

01:41.219 --> 01:45.009
And-and my stomach was icky,
and like that.

01:45.030 --> 01:49.150
Well, now that you're rested.
Go fetch some water!

01:49.170 --> 01:51.180
Uh, y-yes, Papa Smurf.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.140
Phew.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.170
I sure could use a drink.

02:00.010 --> 02:03.109
So could we, but Lazy
never brought the water.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.219
He didn't?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.170
Oh, I'll bet he's off
sleeping again.

02:07.189 --> 02:12.020
And when I find him, I'm going
to give him a piece of my smurf.

02:12.039 --> 02:15.189
Because no one fools Papa Smurf
and gets away with..

02:15.210 --> 02:17.069
[screams]

02:19.150 --> 02:21.009
splash

02:22.170 --> 02:26.000
Go to the forest
and smurf some firewood.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.050
Yes, Papa Smurf.

02:28.069 --> 02:30.000
Good idea, Papa Smurf.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.219
There is no room for loafers,
I always say.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.090
And Greedy can help, too.
He needs the exercise.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.180
[gulps]

02:39.009 --> 02:41.199
Work, work, work.
That's all we ever do.

02:41.219 --> 02:43.150
(Brainy)
No sense grumbling, Lazy.

02:43.170 --> 02:47.129
Papa Smurf says we Smurfs have
to pull together as a team.

02:47.150 --> 02:52.090
After all, a little hard work
never hurt any-smurf, right?

02:52.110 --> 02:53.229
- Wrong!
- Wrong!

02:54.139 --> 02:55.170
thud

02:55.189 --> 02:58.129
That theory bears reexamination.

02:58.150 --> 03:02.000
I'm sick of work.
All I want is a little nap.

03:02.020 --> 03:07.000
[sighs]
All I want is a big basket
of...smurfberries!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.060
Mmm.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.189
chomp chomp chomp

03:12.180 --> 03:14.169
I'm too tired to eat.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.180
Wow, a perfect spot for a nap.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.150
Ah! A quick rest and I'll..

03:26.170 --> 03:28.039
[yawning]

03:28.060 --> 03:30.129
...get right back to work.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.039
(Cicero)
'Lazy.'

03:33.060 --> 03:34.099
Now, what?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.110
[gasps]

03:35.129 --> 03:37.009
'Oh. Oh, who are you?'

03:37.030 --> 03:38.099
I am Cicero.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.189
And you, my friend,
are overworked.

03:41.210 --> 03:44.210
- I'll say.
- You need a vacation.

03:44.229 --> 03:47.110
And I have
just the place for you.

03:47.129 --> 03:49.129
Well, well, wait a minute.
What place?

03:49.150 --> 03:51.020
Paradise, of course.

03:51.039 --> 03:54.030
Where there is no work,
no responsibility

03:54.050 --> 03:56.170
and nobody to tell you
what to do.

03:56.189 --> 03:58.039
'Oh, you'll love it.'

03:58.060 --> 03:59.150
Well, I-I..

03:59.170 --> 04:03.080
(Brainy)
'Lazy! Lazy!'

04:03.099 --> 04:06.129
Um, uh, okay, I'll go.
But just for a few minutes.

04:06.150 --> 04:09.110
That's the spirit.
Right this way.

04:09.129 --> 04:14.050
There he is. Lazy, where have
you been? We have work to do.

04:14.069 --> 04:15.150
Come on.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.079
[both gulp]

04:18.100 --> 04:19.160
You see that?

04:19.180 --> 04:22.149
Lazy smurfed
right through that waterfall.

04:22.170 --> 04:24.189
We have to rescue him.

04:24.209 --> 04:26.089
You go see where he went, Greedy

04:26.110 --> 04:30.060
while I, um, uh,
keep an eye on the firewood.

04:30.079 --> 04:33.079
No way. After you, Brainy.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.180
(Brainy)
'Wait. Uh, let's discuss
this Smurf to Smurf.'

04:38.129 --> 04:39.209
Wow.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.000
(both)
Wow.

04:44.019 --> 04:46.100
[instrumental music]

04:54.019 --> 04:57.170
Well, well. Welcome to paradise.

04:57.189 --> 04:59.110
I am Bacchus, your host.

04:59.129 --> 05:00.220
[giggles]

05:01.000 --> 05:05.079
'Whatever you desire here
is yours to enjoy.'

05:05.100 --> 05:07.209
Oh, boy. Thanks, Master Bacchus.

05:07.230 --> 05:09.220
chomp chomp chomp

05:10.000 --> 05:11.230
Yeah, thanks a lot.

05:15.189 --> 05:20.050
But we can't stay here, we have
firewood to gather. And..

05:20.069 --> 05:22.170
Firewood? Take all you want.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.089
[Bacchus laughing]

05:24.110 --> 05:26.139
And, and Papa Smurf said

05:26.160 --> 05:28.199
"Never talk to a stranger."

05:28.220 --> 05:31.199
But you're among friends now.
He-he-he.

05:31.220 --> 05:35.069
And Papa Smurf's
gonna be real mad if..

05:35.090 --> 05:37.170
Oh, don't be
such a party smurfer.

05:37.189 --> 05:39.009
Yeah, Brainy.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.069
Relax a little.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.220
[muffled grunts]

05:43.000 --> 05:46.100
You Smurfs have fun,
for life is short.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.069
[laughing]

05:51.060 --> 05:55.100
I've slept in every bed here,
and I can't sleep another wink.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.019
I can't eat another crumb.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.220
And I'm bored.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.079
[yawning]
Me too.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.019
[hiccup]
Me too.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.019
Me three. Yoo-hoo!

06:06.040 --> 06:07.220
- 'Mr. Bacchus.'
- Bacchus.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.149
Ah, what can I do for you?
More pillows, more pastries?

06:12.170 --> 06:15.180
- More excitement.
- We're bored.

06:15.199 --> 06:18.060
- Yeah, me too.
- So am I.

06:18.079 --> 06:19.180
Let's play a game.

06:19.199 --> 06:23.100
How about hide and hunt, boss?
That's a good game.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.189
Hide and hunt?
I never heard of it.

06:25.209 --> 06:27.110
(Bacchus)
Oh, it's fun.

06:27.129 --> 06:30.220
You Smurfs go hide,
and Cicero and I will hunt.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.029
There we go.

06:32.050 --> 06:36.120
One, two, three,
four, five, six..

06:37.170 --> 06:39.180
[panting]

06:40.199 --> 06:44.040
Perfect.
He'll never find us here.

06:44.060 --> 06:47.189
I hope not. All that running
around wore me out.

06:47.209 --> 06:50.120
...eight, nine, ten.

06:50.139 --> 06:53.110
Ready or not, here we come.

06:53.129 --> 06:56.120
Oh, they want excitement,
we'll give them excitement.

06:56.139 --> 06:58.129
[both laughing]

07:01.160 --> 07:03.120
- You see 'em, boss?
- No.

07:03.139 --> 07:07.129
But I have a feeling
they're right over there.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.139
[both scream]

07:14.000 --> 07:16.019
Help!

07:16.040 --> 07:18.060
(Greedy)
'Lazy!'

07:18.079 --> 07:21.069
I only heard two voices, boss.

07:21.089 --> 07:24.220
Hm. I must be losing my touch.

07:25.199 --> 07:29.069
(Greedy)
'Lazy, help us.'

07:29.089 --> 07:33.079
[gasping]
Oh, would you two
quit fooling around?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.050
Get us out of here!

07:35.069 --> 07:37.019
I'll never get a nap.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.129
chomp

07:38.149 --> 07:41.230
Ugh, how did you fall
in there, anyway?

07:42.009 --> 07:43.060
[grunts]

07:43.079 --> 07:47.050
- I don't know.
- It just kinda...happened.

07:47.069 --> 07:49.019
Sure it did. Come on.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.050
Let's find a better hiding spot.

07:52.029 --> 07:54.189
Surprise, surprise.

07:54.209 --> 07:57.069
What? I missed them?
Where'd they go?

07:57.090 --> 08:00.009
Don't worry, boss.
They can't be far away.

08:00.029 --> 08:02.019
Yes, yes, I, I'll bet

08:02.040 --> 08:05.069
they're right over...there!

08:05.089 --> 08:06.220
He'll never find us here.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.050
[zapping]

08:09.069 --> 08:11.089
- Look out.
- Look out.

08:11.110 --> 08:14.100
Oof! Hey, what's the big idea?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.110
It wa-wa-wasn't us.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.230
Th-that statue moved.

08:19.009 --> 08:21.079
Sure, and I'm moving, too.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.050
To a quieter hiding place.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.040
Hey, wait for us.

08:26.009 --> 08:27.029
[Bacchus laughing]

08:27.050 --> 08:29.069
Now, I've...got you?

08:29.089 --> 08:31.220
Gah. They escaped again.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.139
I'm getting angry.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.049
Easy, boss. Easy.

08:36.070 --> 08:38.100
You will find them
this time for sure.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.169
Yes, I will.

08:40.190 --> 08:43.090
Because no matter
where they are hiding

08:43.110 --> 08:45.220
this time I'll get them.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000

08:56.120 --> 08:58.100
- Yikes!
- Yeow!

08:58.120 --> 09:00.029
[rumbling]

09:00.049 --> 09:01.149
(all)
Whoa!

09:03.090 --> 09:04.120
Aha!

09:04.139 --> 09:07.039
I found you.

09:07.059 --> 09:08.159
[rumbling]

09:12.019 --> 09:13.090
wham

09:13.110 --> 09:14.149

09:15.190 --> 09:17.200
Come on. Here's a way out.

09:19.009 --> 09:21.100
(Brainy)
It sure looks dangerous.

09:22.169 --> 09:24.230
This game has gone too far.

09:25.009 --> 09:27.179
Come, Cicero,
it's time to stop

09:27.200 --> 09:32.070
playing with these Smurfs
and prepare for dinner.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.009
You're right,
this place is dangerous.

09:38.009 --> 09:40.200
[sniffs]
Hey, can't be all that bad.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.000
I smell home cooking.

'Message from Bacchus.'

09:53.019 --> 09:55.029
Here's tonight's
special menu.

09:55.049 --> 09:58.190
Hmm, I see, we're having
guests for dinner.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.200
- Hey, that's us.
- Oh, yes.

10:00.220 --> 10:04.000
Bacchus wants
Souffle a la Smurf.

10:04.019 --> 10:06.179
(all)
Souffle a la Smurf?

10:06.200 --> 10:09.029
That's us, alright.

10:09.049 --> 10:11.120
Well, l-l-l-let us
get out of here.

10:12.210 --> 10:13.230
thud

10:15.090 --> 10:18.200
- Going somewhere?
- Oh, oh..

10:18.220 --> 10:20.070
- Not us.
- Not us.

10:20.090 --> 10:23.139
Good. Because now
the party is over.

10:23.159 --> 10:27.110
It's time to pay...the bill.

10:27.129 --> 10:28.129
P-Pay?

10:28.149 --> 10:31.120
B-B-But we t-thought
it was for free.

10:31.139 --> 10:34.220
Free? Ha-ha-ha!
You little fools.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.210
'Someone has to cook my food'

10:36.230 --> 10:41.090
'and cut my wood and tend
my gardens, don't they?'

10:41.110 --> 10:44.009
Well, then, thence
you are too small

10:44.029 --> 10:45.080
to do any of those things

10:45.100 --> 10:47.149
there's only
one place left for you

10:47.169 --> 10:49.149
'on my dinner plate.'

10:49.169 --> 10:51.120

No!

'Ow!'

10:56.190 --> 10:58.070
'Don't let them escape.'

10:58.090 --> 11:01.230
- We won't, boss.
- 'No!'

11:02.009 --> 11:03.100
Yeow!

11:03.120 --> 11:06.190

'You will never escape,
Smurfs. Never.'

before they break free.'

Wait for me.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.100
Yeow!

11:43.120 --> 11:46.120
Brainy, Greedy, wait for me.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.049
whoosh

11:49.070 --> 11:50.169
zap zap

11:54.159 --> 11:57.200
Help! Let me out.
Let me out!

11:57.220 --> 12:00.110
- Lazy! Lazy!
- Lazy! Lazy!

No, let me go.

12:08.129 --> 12:10.230
- Lazy!
- Lazy!

12:11.009 --> 12:13.080
No, please! No!

12:13.100 --> 12:15.090
Huh? Huh? Huh? What?

12:15.110 --> 12:18.080
Lazy, we've been looking
all over for you.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.129
Papa Smurf said
to be back at sundown.

12:21.149 --> 12:23.129
- Yeah, we're late.
- Oh.

12:23.149 --> 12:26.129
Oh! Am I glad to see you.

12:26.149 --> 12:28.210
You are?

12:28.230 --> 12:30.120
(Papa Smurf)
'We did it, Smurfs.'

12:30.139 --> 12:33.009
We got ready for winter
in the smurf of time

12:33.029 --> 12:36.090
and we couldn't have done it
without every-smurf's help.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.129

'Lazy, you're the only
Smurf still awake.'

[chuckles]
Why haven't you drifted off
to dreamland too?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.120
I've already been
to dreamland, Papa Smurf

12:50.139 --> 12:53.129
and it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

12:53.149 --> 12:55.129
