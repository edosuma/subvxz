WEBVTT

00:11.803 --> 00:14.014
<i>Inbound with two tons of bauxite.</i>

00:20.062 --> 00:22.022
You couldn't be more wrong.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.942
It is a return
to the ideals of Lenin and Stalin.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.735
Oh, please.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.030
I came here to test
the modified anchor clamps,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.990
not discuss geopolitics.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.952
I already tested the clamps.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.036
They work fine.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.581
If only your opinion were enough
for Star City.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.291
Let's go!

00:44.127 --> 00:48.465
You don't have Gorbachev
and his cronies to protect you anymore.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.634
New times, Svetlana Zakharova.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.885
Oh, yes.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.555
Will Korzhenko save us
the same way Stalin did?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.306
Shooting dissidents in the forest

00:56.306 --> 00:57.724
and dumping their bodies in pits?

00:57.724 --> 01:00.853
Stalin won the Great Patriotic War.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.522
The blood
of an entire generation won that war.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.438
Not Stalin.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.942
Listen,
the West walked all over Mother Russia!

01:06.942 --> 01:09.236
Korzhenko will return us to the days when

01:09.236 --> 01:11.864
the world lived in fear of our might.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.907
You are delusional, Vasily.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.660
And you are a traitor.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.245
Spitting on your own culture

01:18.245 --> 01:20.289
spreading your legs in front of the West.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.957
Go to hell.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.458
Go yourself.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.502
This is complete bullshit!

01:40.559 --> 01:42.227
Exhale or your lungs will burst!

01:46.315 --> 01:51.820
Mayday, Mayday! Happy Valley,
we need a medevac at Depo One ASAP!

04:12.002 --> 04:13.462
...and may never regain consciousness.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.172
I have spoken to President Korzhenko

04:15.172 --> 04:18.216
and he demands
that there be repercussions.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.606
Jesus Christ.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.193
What did Mayakovsky say?

04:36.193 --> 04:40.030
Vasily's still unconscious.
Got a hell of a case of the bends.

04:41.198 --> 04:45.202
Won't be out of the hyperbaric chambers
for another few days minimum.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.163
And that's when they'll know
if there's any long term damage.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.707
Been seeing more of this
up here in the last couple of weeks

04:50.707 --> 04:52.000
since what happened in Moscow.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.253
Russian against Russian.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.631
We can't have this, Ed. Not up here.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.260
What are you saying?

05:01.260 --> 05:02.886
I'm pulling her wings.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.472
Just because he lost the fight
doesn't mean he was innocent.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.558
Svetlana could have killed Galkin.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.142
But she didn't.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.479
Either way, I'm removing her
from flight status indefinitely.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.982
Come on, Dani.
You know what flying means to her.

05:14.982 --> 05:19.069
Yes. But there have got to be
consequences for what she did.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.614
She'll be confined to the base
without pay for 60 sols.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.700
I think you should reconsider.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.744
You said it yourself.
Look, she's one of the best pilots we got.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.873
And if you wanna stay on
the asteroid training mission schedule,

05:30.873 --> 05:32.040
we'll have a hell of a time

05:32.040 --> 05:34.209
trying to find someone else
to bring up to her level.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.711
I've made my decision.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.714
Bring her in.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.268
Svetlana.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.571
Comrade Zakharova.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.781
I have read the incident report,

06:04.781 --> 06:07.201
and I've come to a decision
about your punishment.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.577
It's irrelevant.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.621
What do you mean?

06:11.788 --> 06:15.959
I've just heard from Star City.
I've been recalled to Moscow.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.463
I am to go home on Unity.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.302
Unity leaves tomorrow.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.931
Why?

06:28.931 --> 06:34.311
I'm to stand trial for assault and crimes
against a patriot of Soviet Union.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.313
But-- Wait. That doesn't make sense.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.483
The Soviets have never recalled a
cosmonaut for something like this before.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.195
Vasily's family is connected to
the new regime.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.666
<i>And with what we've all been hearing
about political retribution</i>

06:55.666 --> 06:57.417
<i>under this new Soviet government,</i>

06:58.168 --> 07:01.839
<i>I just don't feel like I can agree to
send her back under these circumstances.</i>

07:01.839 --> 07:03.507
<i>As the Commander of Happy Valley,</i>

07:03.507 --> 07:06.718
<i>my first priority is
to the safety of this crew.</i>

07:08.720 --> 07:11.765
Well, I gotta say
I'm with Commander Poole on this one.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.560
We can't just stand back
while they ship her to some gulag.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.271
I hear you, Will. I do. But...

07:17.271 --> 07:19.731
where this gets tricky is
with the M-7 Charter

07:19.731 --> 07:22.401
that President Wilson negotiated
with Gorbachev.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.777
It says it pretty clear.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.322
Any nation that desires to recall
one of its citizens from Mars,

07:27.322 --> 07:28.782
it's within their rights.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.535
So we're just gonna kowtow
to this-- this lunatic?

07:31.535 --> 07:33.745
No one said anything about kowtowing.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.540
The president wants to stand up
for what's right.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.294
But history is not made by talking
with only the people that agree with you.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.923
Now tell us more
about this new head of Roscosmos.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.967
So I know who we're dealing with here.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.637
Irina Morozova.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.139
From what little we know about her,

07:52.139 --> 07:54.892
she's been in the security
and surveillance apparatus

07:54.892 --> 07:57.019
at Star City since '69.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.229
From an elite Russian family in Moscow.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.482
She seemed to have fallen out of favor
with the Gorbachev regime,

08:02.482 --> 08:06.862
as did much of the KGB, which, we think,
is why she backed Korzhenko.

08:06.862 --> 08:11.158
We've been getting reports that she's been
slowly purging Roscosmos of those

08:11.158 --> 08:12.951
thought to be disloyal to the new regime.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.996
And it looks like she's settling scores up
on Mars now too.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.666
Cosmonaut Zakharova was
an outspoken supporter of Gorbachev.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.212
Well, I'm sure a compromise can be found.

08:23.212 --> 08:27.257
If I can hash out a good deal
with the UAW, I guarantee I can with her.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.719
I like working with the Russians.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.347
They're direct.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.183
They don't like beating around the bush.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.520
We'll just have to talk it out.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.693
Here is the underwear for Libes,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.072
dental floss for Crouse,

08:50.072 --> 08:51.990
socks for Halotek.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.617
- Here we go.
- Okay.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.119
I got some more orders.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.372
David Markman wants more beef jerky.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.583
And Reilly wants more porn.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.087
These are his preferred genres.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.298
Reilly, he is a sick fuck.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.092
A sick fuck with money.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.261
My favorite kind.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.638
And Lee gave me the next order
for the North Koreans.

09:14.638 --> 09:19.601
They want more fungal cream,
more energy bars, more Fruit of the Loom.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.812
This North Korean market, Milosh.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.356
This is a gold mine.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.319
Speaking of which,
any word on that special request?

09:29.319 --> 09:31.196
Our North Korean friend was asking.

09:31.196 --> 09:35.075
My associate is working on it.
Tell Lee to be patient.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.037
Your--

09:39.037 --> 09:41.456
Your associate,
how long have you worked with him?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.834
Many years. He is friend.

09:43.834 --> 09:48.172
We worked together on Moon.
Now he is Earthside.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.800
And your associate, would he be interested
in other business ventures?

09:52.301 --> 09:55.387
I mean, like, if we found something
up here that we could sell down there?

09:56.597 --> 10:00.100
What could people on Earth want
from this wasteland?

10:00.100 --> 10:03.562
Well, I sent my daughter a Mars rock.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.314
Well, Sam found it for me, actually,

10:05.314 --> 10:11.069
but it's like a
really rare volcanic glass.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.154
A rock?

10:13.488 --> 10:14.823
Here. Just listen.

10:14.823 --> 10:19.494
<i>She loved the rock you sent her,
but don't get mad.</i>

10:20.037 --> 10:21.371
<i>Okay, we were at the Galleria</i>

10:21.371 --> 10:24.750
<i>and I was just browsing
for a new pair of earrings and, you know--</i>

10:24.750 --> 10:28.128
<i>Of course, Lily was playing
with her favorite new shiny red rock.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:31.340
<i>And the owner of the jewelry store
started asking me</i>

10:31.340 --> 10:33.592
<i>about where the thing came from.</i>

10:34.510 --> 10:35.928
<i>Well, I told her.</i>

10:35.928 --> 10:40.891
<i>And, get this, she offered me
five grand for it on the spot.</i>

10:42.059 --> 10:44.478
<i>She's--
She's gonna make jewelry out of it,</i>

10:44.478 --> 10:47.147
<i>and she wants more.</i>

10:48.398 --> 10:51.818
I'm thinking
if your guy could get it to Amanda,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.279
this could be a big opportunity.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.909
So now we are import-export, huh?

10:58.909 --> 11:00.035
Why not?

11:00.035 --> 11:03.080
No. Milosh, this is not what we do.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.293
I have system. Same system for years.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.629
Ilya, she made five grand
off a couple ounces.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.673
I'm talking about it's rare even up here.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.591
Could you imagine
what we could do with that?

11:14.591 --> 11:17.803
No, we have to be careful. You understand?

11:17.803 --> 11:20.722
Start sending things down,
we'd need more people.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.058
More people means more risk.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.520
More mouths to feed.
More ways to get fucked.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.858
My way is the best way, Milosh.
You understand?

11:30.858 --> 11:31.984
Yeah, I understand.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.989
<i>And it is my sincere hope</i>

11:36.989 --> 11:40.367
that the two of us can find
a reasonable solution to this situation

11:40.367 --> 11:42.703
that is acceptable to both our nations.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.872
We are partners after all.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.081
<i>Indeed, we are.</i>

11:46.081 --> 11:48.667
As partners,
we appreciate your cooperation

11:48.667 --> 11:52.838
in returning Svetlana Zakharova
to the Soviet Union to face justice.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.049
<i>Look, it was just a little dustup.
That's all.</i>

11:56.049 --> 11:57.217
<i>Tempers ran hot.</i>

11:57.217 --> 12:00.929
<i>They're under a lot of pressure to get
the asteroid program up and running.</i>

12:00.929 --> 12:04.391
And from what I'm being told,
Galkin is on the mend.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.561
So this really would be
best handled by Commander Poole in situ.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.730
<i>It is not a question of his recovery.</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:14.234
Cosmonaut Zakharova broke Soviet law,
Administrator Hobson.

12:16.195 --> 12:19.948
At any rate, the Happy Valley Commander
is on top of the situation.

12:19.948 --> 12:24.161
Our charter clearly states that no
individual member of the M-7 has authority

12:24.161 --> 12:25.913
over base disciplinary action.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.373
That is in the purview
of the base commander.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.667
<i>But this doesn't fall under
base discipline.</i>

12:31.293 --> 12:36.340
As I said, this is about
enforcement of law. Soviet Law.

12:36.340 --> 12:41.428
<i>Zakharova's a Soviet citizen
and she assaulted a Soviet citizen.</i>

12:42.346 --> 12:44.681
<i>And the M-7 Charter also clearly stated</i>

12:44.681 --> 12:48.936
we have the right to recall
any Soviets from Mars at our discretion.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.648
A right we now wish to exercise.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.819
Well, that's the tricky thing, Irina.

12:58.820 --> 13:03.242
As you know, that agreement was made
when Gorbachev was head of the USSR,

13:03.825 --> 13:09.081
but now with your recent change of
government that you've all experienced--

13:09.081 --> 13:10.582
<i>Am I also to understand that</i>

13:10.582 --> 13:13.460
<i>once Albert Gore became president
of the United States,</i>

13:13.460 --> 13:17.589
all of President Ellen Wilson's
treaties become invalidated?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.220
That--

13:23.846 --> 13:25.138
It is not the same thing.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.723
<i>At all.</i>

13:27.891 --> 13:29.685
Why don't we just
cut to the chase here, okay?

13:29.685 --> 13:31.436
You are insisting on this because

13:31.436 --> 13:35.357
Vasily Galkin's uncle has close ties
to your new premier.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.610
Propaganda spread
by opponents of the new government.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.113
Galkin's family has no bearing on this.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.448
As it would have none
in your system of justice.

13:44.324 --> 13:49.830
The simple fact is the United States
is not going to sanction this transfer.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.373
If you don't agree to abide

13:51.373 --> 13:55.127
by the terms we have all agreed to
in the Charter,

13:55.836 --> 13:59.882
<i>then we will be forced to reconsider
participation in the M-7.</i>

14:11.185 --> 14:13.061
Well, that didn't go well, did it?

14:28.243 --> 14:30.037
Good day, everyone.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.707
There is much to discuss.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.877
Let's begin.

14:38.504 --> 14:40.047
First order of business.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.885
The Americans have chosen to disregard

14:44.885 --> 14:47.262
the terms of the Mars Treaty

14:47.262 --> 14:51.308
and are refusing to send
Cosmonaut Zakharova back

14:51.308 --> 14:54.645
to face justice for her aggression
against the nephew

14:54.645 --> 14:58.398
of a highly respected member
of the new politburo.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.736
We must resist this egregious act.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.238
Our response is in progress.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.032
They will face consequences
for this course of action.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.408
Director...

15:08.408 --> 15:12.329
it may be wise to reconsider
this position.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.874
If we hope
to reactivate the asteroid program

15:15.874 --> 15:17.960
Zakharova should remain at her post.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.338
Are you suggesting that Zakharova

15:21.338 --> 15:23.882
did not, in fact, attack Vasily Galkin?

15:23.882 --> 15:25.717
No, I am--

15:25.717 --> 15:29.054
If you were stabbed in the back,
Comrade Babanin,

15:29.721 --> 15:31.974
would you hand the dagger
back to your assailant?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.813
No, of course not.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.524
I did not think so.

15:40.524 --> 15:45.112
We must find out if we can
once again trust the Americans.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.405
To this end,

15:46.405 --> 15:50.200
there will be no reactivation
of the asteroid program

15:50.200 --> 15:54.580
until we know what went wrong
with the Kronos mission.

15:54.580 --> 15:58.041
A tragedy that took the life
of our beloved Comrade Kuznetsov.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.545
Comrade Semenov,
you have the preliminary draft of

16:01.545 --> 16:06.049
the XF Kronos asteroid capture
accident investigation ready for us?

16:06.049 --> 16:07.134
Yes.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.761
Comrade Volkova, would you mind
handing them out for me, please?

16:09.761 --> 16:10.846
Immediately, Comrade.

16:20.272 --> 16:23.358
Please give one
to Margaret Reynolds as well.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.904
I want her to review the findings.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.532
My apologies, we only made enough for--

16:30.532 --> 16:32.409
You can give her Babanin's copy.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.331
Comrade Semenov, please continue.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.001
The American design was flawed.

16:41.001 --> 16:45.130
The problem was caused by
an underdamped harmonic oscillation,

16:45.130 --> 16:49.676
induced by
the spacecraft altitude control system.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.931
Altitude control thruster
firings on Ranger-1 excited...

17:46.942 --> 17:48.944
Commander Poole's protecting her.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.822
And she's just walking around up there
like nothing happened.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.365
Yukking it up with the XO.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.868
And I heard
that Vasily might be paralyzed too.

17:55.868 --> 17:56.994
Brain dead.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.329
- That's what Manush told me.
- Really?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.790
A cool 20 says Vasily gets sent home,

18:01.790 --> 18:03.792
and the cosmonaut gets
a slap on the wrist.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.420
No. You really think that?

18:06.420 --> 18:09.840
We gotta spell it out for you?
Svetlana, she's-- she's an anointed one.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.926
She's a cosmonaut.
And Vasily, he's just a peasant like us.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.762
I can guarantee you
it would be a very different story

18:15.762 --> 18:18.265
if one of us sends one of them
to the hospital.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.725
- No.
- Very different.

18:19.725 --> 18:22.686
Guys, I mean,
Vasily is kind of an asshole.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.607
What? I mean, you know it's true.
You know it.

18:26.607 --> 18:27.900
And that makes it okay?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.318
What-- No, okay. I'm not saying--

18:29.318 --> 18:33.530
No, the truth is they don't give a shit
if one of us gets hurt or worse.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.408
Hey, Sam. You got a second?

18:37.117 --> 18:38.285
Yeah.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.329
It's too much. It's gotta stop.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.998
I'm telling you, that's how it goes.

18:42.998 --> 18:46.251
That obsidian rock.
You remember where you found it?

18:47.169 --> 18:50.130
Yeah. Yeah. It was by Peckinpah Mesa.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.924
There were a bunch there.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.051
Would you mind taking me out
tomorrow morning?

18:54.051 --> 18:56.845
I think I can sell them back on Earth.
I'll give you a cut.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.017
How can you be thinking about
selling fucking rocks right now

19:02.017 --> 19:04.228
when Vasily's laying
in a hyperbaric chamber?

19:04.228 --> 19:06.271
There's nothing we can do
about that right now,

19:06.271 --> 19:09.441
except not play
by those motherfuckers' rules.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.736
So this is about justice,
not about filling your pockets?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.863
Why can't it be about both?

19:14.863 --> 19:17.157
Come on. I cut a deal with the suit soop

19:17.157 --> 19:19.660
and he's gonna let me skip the line
and get a pressure suit.

19:19.660 --> 19:21.578
I don't have rover access and you do.

19:24.498 --> 19:25.541
So you in?

19:28.001 --> 19:29.044
No.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.129
Fine, I'll hoof it.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.038
Damn it.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.292
Wait.

20:55.339 --> 20:56.340
May I?

21:26.745 --> 21:28.330
Same diameter and weight.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.210
Clever.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.963
If only the coffee were worth the effort.

21:36.505 --> 21:38.549
I'll take anything right about now.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.344
Thank you.

22:17.045 --> 22:21.383
Are these spin vector calculations
for the new asteroid capture protocols?

22:23.343 --> 22:24.595
Yes.

22:25.596 --> 22:26.597
Yes, and I admit

22:26.597 --> 22:30.434
I'm unable to get the finite element
model to replicate consistently.

22:31.852 --> 22:32.936
May I?

22:50.204 --> 22:52.122
If you switch reference frames,

22:52.122 --> 22:55.375
you might have better luck
with inverting the matrices.

22:58.921 --> 22:59.922
Thank you.

23:00.672 --> 23:01.673
We're even.

23:06.136 --> 23:07.846
Tatyana Alexandrovna Volkova.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.352
I'm Margaret.

23:13.352 --> 23:16.396
I know. We all know who you are.

23:18.774 --> 23:21.235
No one even so much as says, "Hello."

23:21.235 --> 23:22.736
Director Morozova...

23:25.572 --> 23:29.243
Well, she made it very clear that,
we should keep our distance.

23:33.247 --> 23:35.082
So why did you help me just now?

23:36.708 --> 23:39.086
Well, a woman without coffee
is a dangerous woman.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.925
Very true.

24:00.524 --> 24:01.525
Good night.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.778
Good night, Ms. Reynolds.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.496
Have you tried rebooting
the primary root server?

24:14.496 --> 24:17.374
Twice.
Also tried cycling the CPU processors.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.751
Zilch. It's still all in Cyrillic.

24:24.089 --> 24:25.090
Be right back.

24:29.011 --> 24:32.514
Yevgeniy, you know what's going on
with the user interface?

24:32.514 --> 24:33.932
It's all in Cyrillic.

24:33.932 --> 24:37.394
Yes. Roscosmos decided
to revert Ops computer system

24:37.394 --> 24:39.980
back to original Soviet parameters.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.317
What? That is going to
severely disrupt operations.

24:43.942 --> 24:46.403
As the commander of this base,
any changes need to be run--

24:46.403 --> 24:49.156
Soviet Union no longer recognizes
your role as commander.

24:50.324 --> 24:51.950
You can't be serious.

24:52.951 --> 24:53.952
I'm sorry.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.833
Son of a bitch.

24:59.833 --> 25:03.045
I mean, I thought
we were beyond all this bullshit.

25:03.045 --> 25:06.590
It looks like all the other Soviet-aligned
countries are backing their play.

25:06.590 --> 25:10.511
ESA, JAXA are still with us.
ISRO's playing it coy as usual.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.890
What's Houston got to say about all this?

25:14.890 --> 25:18.936
Well, Hobson's getting into it
with Moscow, but it's not looking good.

25:18.936 --> 25:22.981
They're digging in their heels. They still
want Svetlana sent back to Earth.

25:24.775 --> 25:27.778
Wish Kuz was here. He wouldn't have
put up with any of this shit.

25:27.778 --> 25:29.530
Yeah, you got that right.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.659
I doubt this is over,
so I want you all to do safety checks.

25:33.659 --> 25:37.829
Then run full diagnostics
on all your equipment, your stations,

25:37.829 --> 25:39.790
make sure everything's still
in working order.

25:39.790 --> 25:43.085
Palmer, let's do a security sweep
of the entire base.

25:43.085 --> 25:44.920
Make sure
they're not up to something else.

25:44.920 --> 25:48.590
And I want to put someone outside of
Svetlana Zakharova's quarters immediately

25:48.590 --> 25:50.676
to make sure the Soviets don't try
and grab her.

25:51.260 --> 25:52.469
Good idea.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.638
All right,
you've all got your marching orders.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.682
Let's meet back here in two hours.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.058
All right.

26:07.025 --> 26:09.236
<i>How is this even possible, Eli?</i>

26:09.236 --> 26:10.153
Well, sir, I--

26:10.153 --> 26:13.615
<i>A month ago, Happy Valley was
a beacon of international cooperation.</i>

26:13.615 --> 26:16.201
<i>And now it's the front line
of a new Cold War.</i>

26:16.201 --> 26:20.831
Mr. President. Al, I'm working on it,
but this new director of Roscosmos--

26:20.831 --> 26:23.166
<i>You remember my speech in Chicago,
don't you?</i>

26:23.166 --> 26:25.460
<i>I said the Cold War was over.</i>

26:25.460 --> 26:28.338
<i>You think they're not going to play that
on repeat until election day?</i>

26:28.338 --> 26:31.300
That is not gonna happen, sir.
I am going to resolve this.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.051
<i>See that you do.</i>

26:33.051 --> 26:34.136
And may I--

26:41.935 --> 26:45.189
<i>The future of the M-7 alliance
is being called into question</i>

26:45.189 --> 26:47.149
<i>in the wake of a diplomatic crisis</i>

26:47.149 --> 26:51.069
<i>over the legal status
of Cosmonaut Svetlana Zakharova.</i>

26:51.069 --> 26:55.741
<i>International cooperation has been a
hallmark of the Mars colony to this point.</i>

26:55.741 --> 26:57.492
<i>But that seems to have evaporated</i>

26:57.492 --> 27:02.748
<i>as several M-7 nations are refusing
to back the Gore administration's efforts</i>

27:02.748 --> 27:06.877
<i>to protect Zakharova
from reprisals by the new Soviet regime.</i>

27:06.877 --> 27:08.879
<i>The growing conflict has fueled concerns</i>

27:08.879 --> 27:12.382
<i>that this may reignite tensions
between the two superpowers</i>

27:12.382 --> 27:15.636
<i>for the first time since the early 1990s.</i>

27:15.636 --> 27:17.721
<i>Because of what is at stake,</i>

27:18.472 --> 27:21.308
<i>this matter must be resolved expeditiously,</i>

27:22.226 --> 27:25.020
<i>but deliberately
and without any rush to judgment.</i>

27:25.771 --> 27:28.649
<i>This is the question
that's on everybody's mind.</i>

27:28.649 --> 27:31.276
<i>Are you worried
about how the current diplomatic crisis</i>

27:31.276 --> 27:33.987
<i>between the United States
and the Soviet Union</i>

27:33.987 --> 27:36.698
<i>will impact Helios's financial position?</i>

27:37.407 --> 27:41.119
<i>Not at all.
Helios is a multinational corporation.</i>

27:41.119 --> 27:43.413
- We don't have a dog in this fight.
- Shaw.

27:43.997 --> 27:45.749
You got my suit and camera ready?

27:46.625 --> 27:47.835
Pretty cool, huh?

27:48.585 --> 27:50.796
Dev Ayesa back in charge.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.881
Can't wait till he kicks some ass
down there.

27:52.881 --> 27:54.174
Yeah, fuck that guy.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.801
What's your beef with Dev?

27:55.801 --> 27:58.011
Man, he put a lot of people I know
out of work.

27:58.512 --> 28:00.472
Mr. Buzzkill over here.

28:01.932 --> 28:04.351
Here's your camera and cooling garment.

28:04.351 --> 28:05.811
I'll bring your suit out to you.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.731
Store your shit
in one of those lockers over there.

28:12.359 --> 28:15.696
<i>...'cause Helios is a service company.
I'm here to change all that.</i>

28:15.696 --> 28:17.865
<i>To get back to the original vision.</i>

28:17.865 --> 28:20.033
<i>Building a thriving colony on Mars.</i>

28:20.033 --> 28:21.869
<i>Not just for astronauts and scientists,</i>

28:22.744 --> 28:25.289
<i>but for anyone
who wants to make the journey.</i>

28:30.127 --> 28:31.461
Hey, how you doing?

28:32.629 --> 28:34.339
My first time out on the surface.

28:35.674 --> 28:38.635
I'm gonna take some pictures
for the kiddos.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.105
And here's your suit.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.616
Can I get one of those suits?

29:01.617 --> 29:02.868
They're all booked.

29:03.952 --> 29:07.372
If you want to get out there today,
this is the only one I got available.

29:15.464 --> 29:17.007
You gotta key your radio.

29:18.425 --> 29:20.135
Is it supposed to smell like this?

29:34.816 --> 29:36.610
They're on that mesa, pilgrim.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.405
They've been following us for two days.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.992
Only one tribe wears a war bonnet
like that.

29:44.576 --> 29:46.578
Noyuhka Comanche.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.913
Don't look, you fool!

29:58.757 --> 30:00.259
Where the hell are these things?

30:01.301 --> 30:03.011
This is where Sam said they'd be.

30:26.577 --> 30:29.246
Bingo.

31:41.652 --> 31:42.694
Goddamn it!

31:42.694 --> 31:43.779
Fuck!

31:46.698 --> 31:48.951
Oh, man!

32:01.088 --> 32:02.214
Commander Poole?

32:03.382 --> 32:04.925
Sorry to bother you--

32:05.551 --> 32:06.927
What's on your mind?

32:06.927 --> 32:08.011
Well...

32:10.097 --> 32:11.640
Ma'am, downstairs, we're...

32:12.891 --> 32:16.478
concerned about the way
you dealt with-with Svetlana Zakharova.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.189
Who's we?

32:19.189 --> 32:20.899
Some of us Helios workers.

32:21.942 --> 32:23.902
Look, Vasily was our colleague

32:23.902 --> 32:26.405
and we feel like the punishment
cosmonaut Zakharova receives

32:26.405 --> 32:27.698
should be more appropriate.

32:27.698 --> 32:31.159
How do you know
what her punishment's gonna be?

32:31.743 --> 32:34.413
Well, we heard
that you might not be sending her back.

32:34.413 --> 32:35.539
You heard?

32:36.456 --> 32:37.583
I see.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.667
Right.

32:39.585 --> 32:42.379
Well, I talked to everybody who was there,

32:42.379 --> 32:45.716
and you have no idea
how complicated the situation is.

32:47.759 --> 32:50.721
- Now, if you'll, excuse me--
- She put him in a hyperbaric chamber.

32:50.721 --> 32:54.141
I mean, the nitrogen in his blood could
lead to a stroke, paralysis or worse.

32:54.141 --> 32:56.560
And she's just walking around
as if it's another day?

32:57.895 --> 32:59.062
It's not right.

33:00.147 --> 33:01.565
You know it's not right.

33:28.175 --> 33:29.510
How's he progressing, doc?

33:30.636 --> 33:34.097
Arterial gas embolism is the main concern.

33:35.265 --> 33:36.517
No way to predict.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.479
But he is strong. We can hope.

33:41.438 --> 33:43.190
What do you think of all this mess?

33:45.025 --> 33:48.403
You and I, we've been through worse.

34:04.461 --> 34:06.255
Hey, where's Miles?

34:06.255 --> 34:08.715
We gotta get the obsidian
into the hopper cargo before launch.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.092
How should I know, Rich?

34:10.092 --> 34:11.510
Thought you went with him.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.762
No, no, he--

34:14.888 --> 34:16.723
He asked me but I said no.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.768
He should have been back by now.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.772
It's been almost five hours.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.360
We need to go find him.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.906
Miles, Sam. Do you read?

34:34.658 --> 34:36.952
Miles, Samantha, do you read? Over.

34:42.123 --> 34:45.835
Waters, rover 7,
I'm arriving at Peckinpah Mesa now.

34:45.835 --> 34:48.589
- I think I see where he was headed.
- Copy that.

35:16.491 --> 35:20.454
No, no, no. No, no.

35:30.506 --> 35:33.133
Thank God. Miles? Miles, are you okay?

35:33.133 --> 35:35.677
Miles. Miles. Miles!

36:01.870 --> 36:05.707
Sam, you found me. You found me.

36:05.707 --> 36:09.545
Thank God. Thank God.
You gotta get me out of here, Sam.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.091
What happened?

36:17.928 --> 36:21.932
Can you hear me?
How the hell did you get down there?

36:24.768 --> 36:27.980
Radio must be busted.
Hang on, I'm gonna get you out of there.

37:06.643 --> 37:11.356
I fell
and I think I gashed my arm when I fell.

37:11.356 --> 37:12.941
Thank you for coming to get me.

37:12.941 --> 37:14.443
You fucking asshole!

37:14.443 --> 37:16.445
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Sam!

37:16.445 --> 37:19.239
That tank in the Helios suit is
the only reason you're not dead!

37:19.239 --> 37:21.533
- Sam, relax!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:21.533 --> 37:23.327
Sam, Sam, calm down.

37:33.629 --> 37:34.630
Hold still.

37:40.719 --> 37:41.970
Take it easy.

37:53.065 --> 37:54.441
Okay, all done.

37:56.109 --> 37:57.110
Thanks.

38:08.413 --> 38:12.709
<i>Rover 7, Waters, come in.
Have you located Miles? Come in.</i>

38:13.377 --> 38:15.546
- We should get back.
- Yeah.

38:21.134 --> 38:25.389
Waters, rover 7, I found him. All is fine.
We're heading back soon.

38:26.181 --> 38:29.518
<i>Great news, rover 7.
Please smack him in the head for me.</i>

38:48.453 --> 38:49.955
Is this accurate?

38:52.583 --> 38:53.750
Yes.

39:02.676 --> 39:04.052
Come in to my office.

39:08.849 --> 39:09.892
Sit.

39:11.435 --> 39:12.686
I want you here.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.073
Have a seat, Comrade Semenov.

39:25.073 --> 39:28.493
We were just going over
the accident report

39:28.493 --> 39:32.414
issued by your department.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.958
Is there some problem?

39:36.001 --> 39:37.586
Tell him what you told me.

39:39.796 --> 39:44.176
There was a manufacturing error
in the asteroid anchor bolts

39:44.176 --> 39:49.181
that were designed and built by Roscosmos,
but it wasn't caught by quality control.

39:50.307 --> 39:52.100
They did not meet specifications

39:52.100 --> 39:54.728
and should not have been
certified for flight.

39:54.728 --> 39:57.981
That was one of the main
underlying causes of the failure.

39:59.316 --> 40:02.945
What about Commander Baldwin sanctioning
an emergency EVA?

40:05.155 --> 40:08.784
Your report was quite clear about
the command and control issues,

40:08.784 --> 40:12.204
but even if everything had
gone according to plan,

40:12.204 --> 40:14.248
those anchor bolts would have failed.

40:14.998 --> 40:16.500
And so would the mission.

40:18.085 --> 40:19.795
Your report doesn't mention this.

40:22.464 --> 40:23.882
I will not sit here

40:23.882 --> 40:26.134
and listen to an American making
unfounded accusation--

40:26.134 --> 40:30.514
You will sit here until you are dismissed.

40:37.729 --> 40:41.567
When they get this,
NASA will double-check every calculation

40:41.567 --> 40:44.611
before combining it in
the joint incident report.

40:45.320 --> 40:50.200
They'll realize that the extrapolated
tensile yields strengths of the bolts

40:51.451 --> 40:53.370
couldn't possibly be correct.

40:53.370 --> 40:56.498
And Roscosmos would be
accused then of a cover-up.

40:57.666 --> 41:02.796
And President Korzhenko's government
embarrassed before the entire world.

41:03.714 --> 41:04.798
Director, I--

41:04.798 --> 41:06.758
You're a good engineer.

41:07.384 --> 41:09.303
You knew about this, didn't you?

41:10.721 --> 41:12.723
But you didn't include it in the report.

41:12.723 --> 41:13.849
Why?

41:18.854 --> 41:24.109
It was a units error made
early in fabrication.

41:24.693 --> 41:28.739
NASA sent the torque test specifications

41:28.739 --> 41:32.743
in pound-feet,
but we work in Newton-meters.

41:34.578 --> 41:38.123
And someone screwed up the conversion.

41:39.416 --> 41:43.337
The bolts passed and we flew them.

41:43.337 --> 41:46.423
Only after the accident did we...

41:49.718 --> 41:51.053
...discover the error.

41:51.053 --> 41:53.180
Who screwed up the conversion?

41:56.391 --> 41:58.810
My team performed the calculations

41:58.810 --> 42:00.896
and therefore I am responsible.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.858
Finally...

42:05.484 --> 42:08.695
some accountability.

42:11.490 --> 42:14.159
Excellent work, Margaret. Stay here.

42:17.329 --> 42:19.623
Come, Kirill.

43:02.583 --> 43:07.254
It's a poem Pushkin wrote in 1825.

43:08.630 --> 43:14.052
He wrote it to Anna Petrovna Kern,
with whom he had an affair.

43:17.556 --> 43:23.562
"Remote in my darkened exile,
the days dragged by so slowly.

43:24.646 --> 43:27.274
Without grace. Without inspiration.

43:28.025 --> 43:31.695
Without tears. Without life. Without love.

43:33.113 --> 43:36.950
Then my spirit woke and you...
you appeared again.

43:38.202 --> 43:44.082
Like a transient vision.
Like pure beauty's spirit."

43:50.088 --> 43:52.925
You did a service today
to the Soviet Union.

43:54.384 --> 43:55.469
And to me.

44:03.477 --> 44:04.770
I want you to have this.

44:06.647 --> 44:11.235
It's a picture of the engineers of
our ground control in 1969.

44:13.820 --> 44:14.821
Sergei?

44:14.821 --> 44:15.906
You knew him?

44:16.490 --> 44:17.699
Yes.

44:17.699 --> 44:20.202
We worked together. A long time.

44:20.911 --> 44:22.871
He was a close friend.

44:24.665 --> 44:28.836
Please accept this as a token of
my appreciation of what you've done today.

44:32.422 --> 44:33.757
What will happen to him?

44:35.384 --> 44:36.385
To Kirill?

44:37.177 --> 44:39.054
He will find a new employment.

44:44.810 --> 44:50.399
I wanted you here
because I know what you're capable of.

44:51.149 --> 44:54.319
All of them, they're afraid.

44:54.319 --> 44:56.905
Afraid of their own shadows.

44:56.905 --> 44:58.407
You are different.

44:59.658 --> 45:02.077
The Americans took you for granted.

45:02.870 --> 45:03.954
I will not.

45:05.914 --> 45:09.251
And I assure you
the work we will do together

45:10.794 --> 45:13.213
will take us far into the cosmos.

45:15.549 --> 45:17.301
Thank you, Director.

45:31.773 --> 45:35.694
<i>Pick up the pace.</i>

45:35.694 --> 45:38.864
<i>Pick up the pace. Pick up the pace.</i>

45:38.864 --> 45:41.033
- Shut up.
- Pick up the pace.

45:41.700 --> 45:45.245
- Pick up the pace. Pick up the pace.
- Shut the fuck up!

45:45.746 --> 45:46.872
<i>Pick up the pace.</i>

45:47.623 --> 45:50.334
- Pick up the pace.
- Shut the fuck up!

45:50.334 --> 45:52.628
- You fucking piece of shit!
- Pick up the pace.

45:52.628 --> 45:54.838
Eli, what's going on?

45:55.714 --> 45:57.674
I'm sorry, I just...

46:01.053 --> 46:02.554
It wouldn't shut the fuck up.

46:02.554 --> 46:04.723
We both know the bike isn't the problem.

46:05.933 --> 46:07.142
I know. I'm sorry.

46:08.060 --> 46:11.730
The president tore into me.
He was pretty peeved.

46:13.482 --> 46:14.483
How peeved?

46:15.025 --> 46:19.988
Well, he may have implied that I have
single-handedly brought back the Cold War.

46:22.741 --> 46:25.661
I'm sorry. I know how hard this job is.

46:25.661 --> 46:28.789
- I'm fine. It's just--
- You're not fine, Eli.

46:28.789 --> 46:31.542
Your cholesterol's up again.
You're not sleeping.

46:31.542 --> 46:34.169
You can barely sit down
with your hemorrhoids flaring up.

46:34.169 --> 46:36.839
Is this you trying to make me feel better,
Kath?

46:36.839 --> 46:39.466
You didn't have to take this job.

46:41.051 --> 46:42.052
I know.

46:43.887 --> 46:46.014
I just-- I felt it was--

46:46.014 --> 46:47.432
- Your duty.
- Yeah.

46:47.432 --> 46:50.227
I know. But there's no end to that.

46:50.894 --> 46:54.690
It's not like one day you wake up and
decide you've made enough of a difference.

46:55.190 --> 46:59.111
The only difference I'm making now
is destroying our alliance on Mars.

47:00.571 --> 47:04.074
Well, you'll figure it out, hon.
You always do.

47:11.665 --> 47:14.126
- I don't deserve you.
- No, you don't.

47:15.794 --> 47:19.006
It's only a few more years.
I promise I will make it up to you.

47:19.006 --> 47:21.967
We're supposed to be
enjoying our retirement by now,

47:21.967 --> 47:23.468
traveling around the world.

47:23.468 --> 47:25.470
We have our whole lives to travel.

47:25.470 --> 47:29.349
We may not have knees to walk on by
the time you're done making a difference.

47:30.434 --> 47:33.812
Well, a beach in Aruba
does sound really good right about now.

47:34.771 --> 47:36.607
Or a cruise down the Nile.

47:36.607 --> 47:38.901
Oh, you know what?

47:38.901 --> 47:41.737
I read about this temple in India.

47:43.238 --> 47:44.239
India?

47:44.740 --> 47:46.867
It was beautiful, Eli.

47:46.867 --> 47:48.869
It's not the Taj Mahal.

47:48.869 --> 47:50.787
It's in the south.

47:50.787 --> 47:53.665
What is that city called
near the Indian Ocean?

47:57.503 --> 47:58.504
Eli?

48:01.965 --> 48:02.966
No, I just-- I--

48:07.095 --> 48:10.516
I think I just figured something out.

48:10.516 --> 48:13.185
- I got to go back to CSC.
- Now?

48:13.185 --> 48:14.811
Thank you. I love you.

48:14.811 --> 48:16.271
Eli.

48:17.731 --> 48:19.483
You're still in your sweatpants.

48:25.697 --> 48:26.823
India?

48:27.324 --> 48:29.493
They're the only neutral country
in the M-7.

48:30.285 --> 48:32.788
They've agreed to accept Svetlana
when she gets back to Earth.

48:33.372 --> 48:35.582
She's gonna be put on trial in India?

48:35.582 --> 48:38.877
Korzhenko and President Gore have already
approved it.

48:38.877 --> 48:40.420
And once she's on Unity,

48:40.420 --> 48:43.841
Roscosmos has agreed to abide by
the terms of the Mars Charter,

48:44.508 --> 48:46.385
and I'd be back in full command
of the base.

48:46.385 --> 48:48.971
Ah, that's all well and good.
But what about Svetlana?

48:48.971 --> 48:50.722
We can't just throw her to the wolves.

48:50.722 --> 48:52.057
No, of course not.

48:52.057 --> 48:53.725
It'll be a fair trial.

48:53.725 --> 48:56.270
With an independent judge looking at
all the evidence.

48:56.270 --> 48:58.522
You really think the Soviets are gonna
abide by this deal?

48:58.522 --> 49:00.566
The State Department's already
signed off on it.

49:00.566 --> 49:03.986
They feel that
with the security protocols,

49:03.986 --> 49:06.405
we can prevent any kind of retribution.

49:06.405 --> 49:09.324
Bunch of pencil dicks trying
to cover their own ass.

49:09.324 --> 49:13.245
This isn't right.
You-- You need to refuse.

49:14.079 --> 49:15.747
Yeah, just tell him to go to hell.

49:15.747 --> 49:18.584
Ed. I've already agreed.

49:19.293 --> 49:20.294
You what?

49:20.794 --> 49:24.840
Svetlana, she's not blameless
in all of this, all right?

49:24.840 --> 49:27.968
She seriously injured a Helios worker.

49:27.968 --> 49:31.847
Intentional or not, there's got to be
some real repercussions for what she did.

49:31.847 --> 49:36.351
You need to back me on this, Dani.
Svetlana is one of our best, right?

49:36.351 --> 49:41.356
And she-she's--
she's important to this base.

49:42.357 --> 49:45.152
And-And she's important
to the asteroid capture team.

49:46.028 --> 49:47.237
- I know that.
- Uh-uh.

49:47.237 --> 49:50.949
Don't send her back. No, you--
No, you-- you find another way.

49:51.950 --> 49:52.951
I can't.

49:54.244 --> 49:55.245
You won't.

49:57.748 --> 49:58.999
I can't and I won't.

50:04.505 --> 50:06.006
Ah, of course not.

50:07.925 --> 50:10.219
This is so fucking typical.

50:11.470 --> 50:12.721
Typical of what?

50:12.721 --> 50:14.097
Of you!

50:15.474 --> 50:19.728
Always so eager to please the higher-ups
to further your own career.

50:19.728 --> 50:22.022
I came out of retirement to take this job.

50:22.523 --> 50:25.192
You think I give a damn about my career?

50:25.192 --> 50:27.653
If this is typical of anybody, it's you.

50:28.320 --> 50:29.780
What's that supposed to mean?

50:30.364 --> 50:34.117
Time after time, you make exceptions
for the people you care about.

50:34.117 --> 50:36.161
And now you're doing it again with her.

50:36.161 --> 50:39.039
You don't think I see what's going on
between the two of you?

50:39.540 --> 50:43.085
Once again, you're letting your
personal feelings affect your judgment.

50:43.085 --> 50:44.169
Once again?

50:44.169 --> 50:47.381
Gordo on Jamestown, Danny when we--

50:47.381 --> 50:49.299
Wait, whatever happened to Danny
is not on me!

50:49.299 --> 50:50.425
Really?

50:50.926 --> 50:54.137
You don't remember me pleading with you
that he wasn't ready?

50:54.638 --> 50:57.724
But you ignored me!
Because you didn't want to see it.

50:58.725 --> 51:01.687
You let your emotions get the best of you
and because of that, he--

51:04.439 --> 51:05.774
And because of that, what?

51:08.318 --> 51:09.444
Now say it, Dani.

51:10.821 --> 51:11.822
Say it.

51:14.616 --> 51:15.993
Say it.

51:16.952 --> 51:20.789
Svetlana Zakharova will be on Unity
when it leaves tonight.

51:21.999 --> 51:24.168
My decision is made.

51:59.494 --> 52:00.621
Tatyana?

52:09.171 --> 52:10.589
Are you okay?

52:15.886 --> 52:17.262
The KGB took him.

52:18.222 --> 52:19.681
Took who?

52:21.016 --> 52:24.019
My mentor, Kirill Semenov.

52:27.272 --> 52:28.815
No...

52:28.815 --> 52:30.484
No, that's not...

52:30.484 --> 52:33.529
He was fired. She wouldn't--

52:33.529 --> 52:35.239
Of course she would.

52:35.239 --> 52:36.532
She is one of them.

52:37.783 --> 52:40.118
Two men came to his office

52:40.118 --> 52:42.120
and they took him away,
in front of everyone.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.039
No one did a thing.

52:45.999 --> 52:47.835
Cowards, all of them.

52:50.337 --> 52:52.047
Even me.

53:24.079 --> 53:25.289
Good afternoon, everyone.

53:27.916 --> 53:29.459
I have good news.

53:31.962 --> 53:33.714
The Americans have folded.

53:34.590 --> 53:36.717
Thanks to our efforts,

53:36.717 --> 53:40.721
Cosmonaut Zakharova will stand trial
for her crimes against the state.

53:40.721 --> 53:42.598
Great job, thank you.

53:43.140 --> 53:47.519
Now we have another busy day,
so let's begin.

53:50.731 --> 53:53.775
First item on the agenda...

54:03.368 --> 54:04.995
This is everything.

54:06.079 --> 54:08.999
Hopper launch is in 30 minutes, I suppose.

54:10.334 --> 54:11.960
No, this isn't over.

54:13.212 --> 54:14.671
Sveta, you don't have to--

54:15.380 --> 54:18.133
If we leave now,
we can make it down to sublevel 4.

54:18.133 --> 54:21.678
They're still working on the east module
there and it's pressurized,

54:21.678 --> 54:23.222
but no one's down there right now.

54:23.222 --> 54:24.306
Edward.

54:24.306 --> 54:27.518
I-I could bring you supplies
and food till all this blows over

54:27.518 --> 54:29.478
and then we figure out
how we keep you here.

54:29.478 --> 54:34.233
Edward, I will not let you
destroy your career to protect mine.

55:05.264 --> 55:06.807
I'll walk her down.

55:06.807 --> 55:09.226
Sir. Are you sure?
There's a lot of angry people out there.

55:09.226 --> 55:10.894
I said I'll walk her down.

55:11.520 --> 55:12.521
Aye, aye, sir.

55:25.868 --> 55:26.910
You ready?

56:40.484 --> 56:44.029
Goodbye, Edward.
