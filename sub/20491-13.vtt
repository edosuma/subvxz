HEY, ONE SLIPPERY NAVEL,
ONE SEX ON THE BEACH,

00:24.033 --> 00:27.400
OH, MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE
- PINK PANTY PULLDOWN.

00:27.501 --> 00:29.200
<i>SOUNDS TASTY.</i>

00:29.300 --> 00:31.567
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,
LEX, MAYBE YOU AND I COULD
GO FOR ONE WHEN THIS IS OVER.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.400
WELL, IT'S A DATE.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.868
<i>WHAT'S HAPPENING
DOWN HERE?</i>

00:34.968 --> 00:36.100
OKAY.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.767
YOU GOT TWO GUARDS BETWEEN
YOU AND THE PAINTING.

00:39.868 --> 00:43.467
<i>YEAH, NOT TO MENTION FOUR
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND
A MOTION SENSOR SYSTEM.</i>

00:43.567 --> 00:45.200
JUST LIKE WE EXPECTED.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.200
THE GAMES BEGIN.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.501
[WHISPERING]
'KAY, GUYS.

01:03.601 --> 01:05.601
MAKING MY WAY OVER.

01:05.701 --> 01:07.868
LET'S MOVE.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.567
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

01:09.667 --> 01:10.367
UM, EXCUSE ME?

01:10.467 --> 01:11.434
YOU TOUCHED ME.

01:11.534 --> 01:13.033
DID YOU SEE THAT?
HE TOUCHED ME.

01:13.133 --> 01:14.434
HEY, I...
I DIDN'T.

01:14.534 --> 01:17.501
YOU PIG!
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF!

01:17.601 --> 01:19.901
COULD SOMEBODY HELP ME?
THIS GUY'S A PERVERT!

01:20.000 --> 01:20.968
I DIDN'T TOUCH HER, I SWEAR!

01:21.067 --> 01:23.367
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THEY ALL SAY.

01:27.267 --> 01:28.033
I DIDN'T...

01:28.133 --> 01:28.968
I DIDN'T TOUCH HER.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.767
YEAH, SURE.

01:35.000 --> 01:35.834
<i>I'M IN.</i>

01:35.934 --> 01:36.901
OKAY.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.167
TAKE YOUR NEXT RIGHT.

01:38.267 --> 01:39.467
THE DOOR SHOULD BE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.667
YEAH, LOOK OUT FOR A GUARD
WHO'S HEADING YOUR WAY.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.100
WHOA, LEX - SOMETHING'S
WRONG. YOU GOT COMPANY.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.968
<i>HURRY, JESS,
GIVE ME THE CODE.</i>

01:55.334 --> 01:58.534
447982.

02:02.767 --> 02:03.934
I'M IN.

02:11.434 --> 02:13.667
BAD IDEA.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.801
THAT'S MINE.

02:24.801 --> 02:28.067
LEXA, TALK TO ME.
YOU OKAY?

02:31.133 --> 02:33.000
NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

03:03.567 --> 03:10.834
[ALARM]

03:10.934 --> 03:13.667
COPPERS ON THE WAY,
LEXA. GET OUT OF THERE.

03:47.501 --> 03:49.534
THIS WAS FUN.

03:49.634 --> 03:53.167
BUT YOU CROSS ME AGAIN
AND YOU WON'T WALK AWAY.

04:05.334 --> 04:09.934
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i>

04:10.033 --> 04:13.968
<i>MANIPULATING DNA TO
SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i>

04:14.067 --> 04:17.233
<i>BUT IN MANY, THEIR GENES
UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i>

04:17.334 --> 04:20.901
<i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i>

04:50.000 --> 04:52.467
<i>TOGETHER, FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL FIGHT</i>

04:52.567 --> 04:56.467
<i>TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i>

04:59.133 --> 05:01.567
<i>THEY ARE...</i>

05:05.367 --> 05:08.501
HE THREW OUT SOME KIND OF DARK
MATTER, LIKE ANTl-ENERGY.

05:08.601 --> 05:11.334
<i>HIS PRESENCE WAS
UNEXPECTED, EVEN BY US.</i>

05:11.434 --> 05:12.701
YEAH.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.200
WELL, BECAUSE OF HIM, I
COULDN'T GET TO THE PAINTING.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.000
<i>THEN YOU TRY AGAIN.</i>

05:16.100 --> 05:19.934
<i>THAT PAINTING CONCEALS
A SECRET THAT MUST REMAIN
HIDDEN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.</i>

05:20.033 --> 05:23.734
EXCUSE ME, BUT AFTER
THE FIRST TRY THEIR SECURITY'S
GOING TO BE ALL OVER IT.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.667
<i>YOUR PRESENCE WAS NOT OBSERVED.</i>

05:25.767 --> 05:27.434
<i>WE WIPED THE SECURITY
SURVEILLANCE,</i>

05:27.534 --> 05:30.467
<i>SO THE GALLERY BELIEVES
YOUR INTRUSION WAS SIMPLY
A FALSE ALARM.</i>

05:30.567 --> 05:32.601
YEAH, BUT STILL, WITHOUT A
PARTY AS A DISTRACTION...

05:32.701 --> 05:35.033
<i>YOU'LL FIND A WAY.</i>

05:38.167 --> 05:39.434
THAT'S NOT BAD.

05:39.534 --> 05:42.100
IT'S GOT DEFINITE ECHOES
OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.501
IT'S NOT THE ARTWORK WE'RE
AFTER, IT'S WHAT'S CODED WITHIN
THE CANVAS.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.801
AND THAT WOULD BE?

05:47.901 --> 05:49.601
THE KEY TO AN
UNDISCOVERED TECHNOLOGY,

05:49.701 --> 05:52.434
THAT COULD THREATEN
THE WORLD'S SECURITY.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.200
SEE, WHEN THE SCIENTIST WHO
OWNED THE PAINTING DIED,

05:54.300 --> 05:57.501
HIS FAMILY LIQUIDATED
THE ESTATE.

05:57.601 --> 06:01.234
AND WE GOTTA GET TO THIS
PAINTING BEFORE OUR PARTY
CRASHER GETS TO IT FIRST.

06:01.334 --> 06:03.701
SO WHAT HAVE WE FOUND OUT
ABOUT OUR RIVAL THIEF?

06:03.801 --> 06:05.734
NOTHING SO FAR.

06:05.834 --> 06:10.300
I MEAN,
WHATEVER HIS POWER IS, HE SEEMS
TO BE ABLE TO COUNTERACT ENERGY.

06:12.534 --> 06:14.701
GUY LOOKS
PRETTY SMOOTH.

06:16.367 --> 06:18.133
VERY SMOOTH.

06:18.234 --> 06:21.100
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A HARD
TIME FIGHTING HIM OFF, LEXA.

06:22.934 --> 06:24.567
I'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.601
WHAT NEXT TIME?

06:26.701 --> 06:28.968
LOOK, HE'S GOING TO MAKE A
MOVE FOR THE PAINTING AGAIN.

06:29.067 --> 06:32.200
I PLAN ON BEATING HIM TO IT.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.767
I'LL HAVE BRENNAN RUN OUR ROMEO
THROUGH THE MUTANT DATABASE.

06:35.868 --> 06:39.300
I'M GOING TO
START MONITORING THE SECURITY
SYSTEM AT THE GALLERY.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.801
OKAY? LET'S GO.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.767
HOLD ON.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.267
<i>HELLO, SHALIMAR.</i>

06:56.367 --> 06:57.634
WHO ARE YOU?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.334
<i>A FRIEND.</i>

06:59.434 --> 07:00.868
FRIENDS SHOW THEMSELVES.

07:00.968 --> 07:02.834
<i>IN TIME.</i>

07:06.200 --> 07:07.467
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:07.567 --> 07:12.234
<i>THERE'S MORE TO THE PAINTING
THAN YOU'VE BEEN TOLD.</i>

07:12.334 --> 07:13.834
SO, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

07:13.934 --> 07:18.067
<i>THE SCIENTIST WHO OWNED IT
WAS NAMED ILLICH SEFCHEK.</i>

07:18.167 --> 07:20.000
<i>FIND OUT WHO HE WAS.</i>

07:20.100 --> 07:26.901
<i>HE REPRESENTS THE KEY TO
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON.</i>

07:27.000 --> 07:28.801
<i>NICE TRY.</i>

07:28.901 --> 07:32.934
<i>BUT IT WILL TAKE SANCTUARY'S
SYSTEM AT LEAST THIRTY MORE
SECONDS</i>

07:33.033 --> 07:36.234
<i>TO TRIANGULATE
MY SIGNAL.</i>

07:36.334 --> 07:37.701
<i>GOODBYE, SHALIMAR.</i>

07:37.801 --> 07:39.767
WAIT!

07:39.868 --> 07:41.701
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

07:41.801 --> 07:45.801
<i>380735.</i>

07:45.901 --> 07:48.467
<i>REMEMBER THAT.</i>

07:56.767 --> 07:58.534
BRENNAN, WE'RE IN.

08:05.701 --> 08:07.701
OKAY, I'VE HACKED INTO THE
GALLERY'S SECURITY SYSTEM.

08:07.801 --> 08:09.033
OH, JUST IN CASE
YOU WERE WONDERING,

08:09.133 --> 08:11.434
I HAVE AN UPDATE ON
YOUR, UH, MYSTERY MUTANT.

08:11.534 --> 08:15.300
TURNS OUT HE'S AN
INTERNATIONAL THIEF
SPECIALIZING IN HIGH-END ART.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.567
TAKE A LOOK, GUYS.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.934
I'M THROWING HIM AT YOU.

08:18.033 --> 08:19.567
<i>HIS NAME'S RANDALL BLAKE.</i>

08:19.667 --> 08:23.200
<i>YEAH, AND ACCORDING TO HIS
DOSSIER, HE'S, UH, QUITE
THE LADY-KILLER.</i>

08:23.300 --> 08:25.834
HE'S MADE A CAREER OUT
OF STEALING PAINTINGS...
AND HEARTS.

08:25.934 --> 08:28.267
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO
KNOW, ISN'T IT, LEX?

08:30.667 --> 08:31.601
OH, NO!

08:31.701 --> 08:32.967
BLAKE'S ALREADY HERE.

08:33.067 --> 08:33.933
WHERE?

08:34.033 --> 08:35.400
RIGHT THERE.

08:35.501 --> 08:37.067
I'VE GOT TO GET IN
THERE BEFORE HE DOES.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.601
WELL, HOW?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.567
GUYS, GIVE ME BLAKE'S LOCATION.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.734
HE'S HEADING UP THE BACK
STAIRCASE, RIGHT TOWARDS YOU.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.868
YOU BETTER HURRY, LEX,
IT'S GOING TO BE TIGHT.

09:12.601 --> 09:15.033
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR BREAK.

09:22.634 --> 09:24.434
JESS, WHAT'S GOING ON? THE
CODE'S NOT WORKING.

09:24.534 --> 09:26.033
UH, THEY MUST HAVE CHANGED IT.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.667
<i>FEED ME THE NEW ONE.</i>

09:27.767 --> 09:29.601
LOOK, IT COULD TAKE ME
HOURS TO BREAK INTO SECURITY
DATABASE AGAIN.

09:29.701 --> 09:32.567
WELL, I CAN'T STAY
INVISIBLE FOREVER.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.501
TRY 380735.

09:35.601 --> 09:37.200
<i>WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?</i>

09:37.300 --> 09:39.467
JUST DO IT.

09:42.501 --> 09:44.834
THAT'S IT. I'M IN.

09:44.934 --> 09:47.534
COME ON, YOU'VE ONLY
GOT A FEW SECONDS.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.968
I BELIEVE THAT
BELONGS TO ME.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.868
POSSESSION IS
NINE-TENTHS OF THE LAW.

10:07.968 --> 10:10.300
YOU'RE NOT OUT
OF HERE YET.

10:13.601 --> 10:16.200
BESIDES, THERE ARE THREE
PAINTINGS TO THE SET,

10:16.300 --> 10:17.934
AND I ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THEM.

10:18.067 --> 10:21.334
SO IT WON'T DO MUCH GOOD
WITHOUT THIS, THEN, WILL IT?

10:21.434 --> 10:24.334
I WARNED YOU NOT
TO GET IN MY WAY.

10:24.434 --> 10:28.000
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
AROUND, YOU COULDA JUST SAID SO.

10:52.501 --> 10:55.033
GIVE UP NOW.

10:55.133 --> 10:58.067
YOU CAN'T HOLD OUT
AS LONG AS I CAN.

11:05.934 --> 11:08.734
BECAUSE I'M NOT A GOOD GIRL.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.234
EVEN BETTER.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.033
YOU JUST HAD TO DO
IT ALONE, DIDN'T YOU?

11:17.133 --> 11:18.767
DID YOU GET THE PAINTING?

11:18.868 --> 11:21.167
YEAH. ONE OF THEM.

11:24.501 --> 11:27.200
WHY WEREN'T WE TOLD THERE WERE
THREE PAINTINGS TO BEGIN WITH?

11:27.300 --> 11:28.801
WELL, MAYBE THE GUY'S BLUFFING.

11:28.901 --> 11:30.734
AT THIS POINT I WOULDN'T
PUT ANYTHING PAST HIM.

11:30.834 --> 11:35.234
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I SAID, BUT LEXA SEEMS
TO FEEL THIS GUY'S ON THE LEVEL.

11:35.334 --> 11:37.968
WELL, WE'LL FIND
OUT SOON ENOUGH.

11:38.067 --> 11:42.567
I'M RUNNING AN INFRARED IMAGE
OF THE PICTURE, SEE WHAT WE GET.

11:47.234 --> 11:49.033
OH, THERE IT IS.

11:49.133 --> 11:50.234
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:50.334 --> 11:51.567
OH, WELL, IT'S A CODE.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.667
UH, LOOKS LIKE IT'S
SOME KIND OF FORMULA.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.033
BUT...

11:55.133 --> 11:57.467
NO, THE CODE'S INCOMPLETE.

11:57.567 --> 12:00.767
I'D GUESS THAT EACH
PAINTING REPRESENTS ANOTHER
LAYER TO THE FORMULA.

12:00.868 --> 12:02.968
SEPARATELY THEY'RE WORTHLESS.
WE NEED ALL THREE.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.767
WELL, BLAKE SAYS HE HAS
ONE OF THE PAINTINGS.

12:04.868 --> 12:06.801
AND HE KNOWS WHERE
THE THIRD ONE IS.

12:06.901 --> 12:10.067
WELL, ACCORDING TO MY MATH,
THAT MEANS WE'RE RIGHT BACK
TO SQUARE ONE, DOESN'T IT?

12:10.167 --> 12:11.501
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

12:11.601 --> 12:14.033
HIS BUYER'S GOING TO NEED
ALL THREE, AS MUCH AS WE DO.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.868
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME RIGHT NOW.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.868
HE NEEDS US AS MUCH
AS WE NEED HIM.

12:18.968 --> 12:21.067
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:21.167 --> 12:24.667
HE THINKS I'M A
RIVAL THIEF, RIGHT?

12:24.767 --> 12:26.100
WHAT IF I CONVINCE
HIM TO PARTNER UP

12:26.200 --> 12:28.067
AND SPLIT THE PROFITS
OF THE THREE PAINTINGS.

12:28.167 --> 12:31.868
OH, HO HO, WE ARE NOT JUST GOING
TO JUMP INTO BED WITH THIS GUY.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.901
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.100
HMM.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.667
WHAT? ARE WE ALL TAKING
CRAZY PILLS HERE?

12:51.100 --> 12:53.300
WELL, LOOKS LIKE BLAKE'S
GOT A PLACE HERE IN TOWN.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.868
WHAT, IS HE LISTED
IN THE YELLOW PAGES?

12:55.968 --> 12:57.234
NO.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.634
HE OWNS A BAR DOWNTOWN
UNDER ONE OF HIS ALIASES.

12:59.734 --> 13:02.734
THE BRASSERIE DU BOHEME.

13:02.834 --> 13:06.868
I GUESS HIS LOVE OF ART GOES
DEEPER THAN CAT BURGLARY.

13:08.167 --> 13:11.534
LEXA, WHY ARE YOU SO EAGER
TO FACE THIS GUY AGAIN?

13:11.634 --> 13:13.601
I MEAN, HE TRIED TO KILL
YOU, YOU REMEMBER THAT?

13:13.701 --> 13:17.634
LISTEN, IF HE WANTED ME DEAD,
HE WOULD'VE TRIED A LOT HARDER.

13:29.434 --> 13:33.033
WHATCHA WORKIN' ON?

13:33.133 --> 13:35.767
ILLICH SEFCHEK.

13:35.868 --> 13:37.167
WHO DAT?

13:37.267 --> 13:38.767
NOT SURE.

13:38.868 --> 13:41.634
HUH.

13:41.734 --> 13:44.467
WELL, FIRST
YOU PULL THE CODE FOR GETTING
INTO THE GALLERY OUT OF THIN AIR

13:44.567 --> 13:49.067
AND NOW YOU'RE,
WELL, LOOKING UP
RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.133
WELL, CAN I BUY A CLUE?

13:53.267 --> 13:55.434
OKAY.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.300
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

13:57.400 --> 14:01.367
BUT I GOT A CALL FROM SOMEONE
ON OUR INTERNAL LINE.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.033
DIDN'T GIVE ME A NAME,
JUST GAVE ME THE CODE.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.934
JUST LIKE THAT?

14:06.033 --> 14:09.601
WELL, HE SAID THERE WAS MORE
TO THE STORY OF THE PAINTINGS
THAN WE WERE BEING TOLD.

14:09.701 --> 14:12.467
SAID I SHOULD LOOK
UP THIS GUY, SEFCHEK.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.968
YOU TRIED TRACING THE CALL?

14:14.067 --> 14:15.234
'COURSE.

14:15.334 --> 14:16.701
WELL, HE MUST HAVE
KNOWN BEFOREHAND

14:16.801 --> 14:19.701
BECAUSE HE KEPT BOUNCING THE
SIGNAL ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

14:19.801 --> 14:22.434
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE THIS GUY'S
KINDA GOT YOU FREAKED OUT.

14:22.534 --> 14:23.567
WELL, I...

14:23.667 --> 14:25.767
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

14:25.868 --> 14:27.167
I MEAN, HE SAID HE WAS A FRIEND.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.133
HE SPOKE LIKE HE KNEW ME.

14:29.234 --> 14:30.667
DON'T WORRY.

14:30.767 --> 14:34.167
NEXT TIME THIS GUY CALLS
WE'LL BE THE ONES MESSING
WITH HIS HEAD.

14:50.934 --> 14:52.701
THAT COULD BE YOU.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.067
WHAT? YOU WERE
EXPECTING ME?

14:56.167 --> 14:57.868
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T STAY AWAY.

14:57.968 --> 14:59.467
OH.

14:59.567 --> 15:00.667
SO, YOU LIKE IT?

15:00.767 --> 15:01.701
YEAH.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.300
WHO'S THE ARTIST?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.968

15:09.434 --> 15:12.267
IT'S AN EARLY PIECE,
BUT IT LACKS IN COURAGE.

15:12.367 --> 15:16.834
IT'S FUNNY, I NEVER TOOK
YOU TO BE THE MODEST TYPE.

15:18.234 --> 15:19.400
ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO...

15:19.501 --> 15:22.033

15:22.133 --> 15:24.934
LET'S JUST KEEP THIS BUSINESS.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.834
I'M LISTENING.

15:26.934 --> 15:28.534
YOU HAVE ONE PAINTING.

15:28.634 --> 15:30.868
I HAVE ONE.

15:30.968 --> 15:33.467
THIRD ONE'S STILL UP FOR GRABS.

15:33.567 --> 15:36.267
AND YOUR POINT IS?

15:37.834 --> 15:41.801
DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST
TO REALIZE THE REAL DEAL HERE,

15:41.901 --> 15:44.567
IS BY DELIVERING UP
THE COMPLETE SET.

15:44.667 --> 15:48.133
YEAH, WELL, MY BUYER IS
WILLING TO PAY NORTH OF...

15:48.234 --> 15:51.267
FIVE MILLION.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.067
I WANT IN.

15:53.167 --> 15:56.434
[SNIFFS] AND JUST...

15:56.534 --> 15:58.200
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

15:58.300 --> 16:01.567
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER GET
YOUR HANDS ON THE COMPLETE
SET WITHOUT ME.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.200
LET'S DO IT.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.601
GOOD.

16:09.701 --> 16:12.868
OH - BUT FIRST - I WANT TO SEE
YOUR PAINTING.

16:12.968 --> 16:16.400
JUST TO VERIFY IT.

16:16.501 --> 16:18.033
OKAY.

16:18.133 --> 16:22.434
YOU SHOW ME YOURS,
I'LL SHOW YOU MINE.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.033

16:27.133 --> 16:28.100
BRENNAN!

16:28.200 --> 16:29.234
COME HERE.

16:29.334 --> 16:30.801
IT'S HIM.

16:30.901 --> 16:32.167
<i>HELLO, SHALIMAR.</i>

16:32.267 --> 16:36.167
<i>WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THE LEAD I GAVE YOU?</i>

16:36.267 --> 16:39.701
HE'S THE CHEMICAL
ENGINEER SPECIALISING
IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH.

16:39.801 --> 16:40.801
<i>EXACTLY.</i>

16:40.901 --> 16:42.734
<i>AND THE PAINTING?</i>

16:42.834 --> 16:45.167
WHAT DID YOU GET FROM THE SCANS?

16:45.267 --> 16:46.934
WELL, WE'RE NOT SURE YET.

16:47.033 --> 16:50.234
<i>THE PAINTINGS ARE THE
KEY TO THE WHOLE PUZZLE.</i>

16:50.334 --> 16:53.567
<i>IT'S IMPERATIVE WE FIND
OUT WHAT THEY'RE HIDING.</i>

16:53.667 --> 16:55.534
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL
ME WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

16:55.634 --> 16:57.567
<i>WHY DON'T YOU ASK BRENNAN?</i>

16:57.667 --> 17:00.667
<i>I'M SURE HE'S FULL
OF BRIGHT IDEAS.</i>

17:00.767 --> 17:03.667
WHAT THE HELL?

17:03.767 --> 17:06.099
HE'S IN OUR SYSTEM.

17:09.834 --> 17:10.968
WHAT'D HE GET?

17:11.067 --> 17:12.934
HE'S TRYING TO ACCESS
THE SCAN OF THE PAINTING.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.099
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH OF THE
FILE HE WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.200
HOW THE HELL DID HE GET INTO
OUR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE?

17:17.300 --> 17:19.767
HOW DOES HE KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT US?

17:21.867 --> 17:23.867
DAMMIT.

17:25.701 --> 17:28.334
TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOT JUST
GOING TO HAND THIS PAINTING OVER
TO HIM.

17:28.434 --> 17:31.133
[SIGHS] IT'LL NEVER
LEAVE MY SIGHT, OKAY?

17:31.234 --> 17:33.868
AND ONCE I GET IN THERE, I CAN
GET A LOOK AT HIS PAINTING.

17:33.968 --> 17:36.100
THAT WAY, I CAN GET
INFORMATION FROM BOTH.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.634
YEAH, BUT ONCE HE GETS HIS
HANDS ON OUR PAINTING,

17:37.734 --> 17:39.467
HE'S NOT GOING TO
NEED YOU ANYMORE.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.634
I TOLD YOU I
CAN HANDLE THIS.

17:41.734 --> 17:43.901
I HEARD YOU.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.367
LOOK, I'M COMING
ALONG THIS TIME.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.534

<i>[PLAYBACK]
THE PAINTINGS ARE THE
KEY TO THE WHOLE PUZZLE.</i>

17:57.133 --> 17:59.567
NOW REMOVE THE VOCAL PATTERN.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.534
SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN HEAR.

18:01.634 --> 18:04.300
[BACKGROUND NOISE]

18:04.400 --> 18:05.767
WHAT IS THAT?

18:05.868 --> 18:08.701
SOUNDS LIKE THE CALL
CAME FROM A RESTAURANT.

18:08.801 --> 18:10.634
YOU NARROW IT DOWN
A LITTLE FURTHER?

18:10.734 --> 18:12.701

18:15.000 --> 18:16.634
NICE.

HAS A PENCHANT FOR CHINESE FOOD.

18:19.834 --> 18:22.767
YOU IN THE MOOD FOR TAKEOUT?

18:31.300 --> 18:33.367

18:41.901 --> 18:43.567
I HAVE A DIGITAL
SCANNER IN THE BACK.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.100
WE COULD VERIFY
MY PAINTING FIRST.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.634
IF YOU LIKE.

18:52.434 --> 18:53.968
HERE WE GO.

WHAT WE HAVE REPRESENTS
TWO-THIRDS OF THE PUZZLE.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.567
SO WHEN DO WE MOVE
ON THE LAST PAINTING?

19:59.667 --> 20:02.167
"WE" DON'T MOVE ON ANYTHING.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.667

OH, WHAT DID YOU THINK, SHAL,

20:32.567 --> 20:34.667
THAT HE WAS JUST GOING
TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT UNTIL
HE GOT THE ITCH TO CALL AGAIN?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.267
I DON'T KNOW.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.634

THROUGH MY FERAL HEARING.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.701

22:14.801 --> 22:16.501

24:06.567 --> 24:10.033
[SIGHS] WELL, WHAT IS IT?

24:10.133 --> 24:14.167
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE A PROPOSAL BY THE SCIENTIST
WHO OWNED THOSE PAINTINGS.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.834
HE THOUGHT HE COULD CREATE AN
ALTERNATIVE TO FOSSIL FUEL.

24:18.934 --> 24:22.167
COST-EFFICIENT METHOD OF
PROCESSING WATER INTO HYDROGEN
POWER.

24:22.267 --> 24:24.167

CLEAN, SAFE, CHEAP FUEL
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD.

24:26.901 --> 24:31.667
AM I STUPID, OR IS THIS THE
BREAKTHROUGH WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR, FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS?

24:31.767 --> 24:34.701
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

24:34.801 --> 24:37.534
SO THIS IS WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT, HUH?

24:37.634 --> 24:38.968
THINK HE ACTUALLY
MADE IT WORK?

24:39.067 --> 24:40.434
WHO KNOWS.

24:40.534 --> 24:42.567
BUT I BET HE HID THAT FORMULA
IN THOSE THREE PAINTINGS.

24:42.667 --> 24:45.067
JESS, YOU GETTING THIS?
- OH, YEAH.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.200
NO WONDER SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO SUPPRESS IT.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.534
YOU KNOW, I'D BET THE HELIX
THAT WHOEVER'S PAYING BLAKE

24:49.634 --> 24:52.267
HAS GOT TENTACLES CONNECTED TO
THE OIL INDUSTRY IN SOME WAY.

24:52.367 --> 24:56.133
YEAH, WELL, THIS INFORMATION
IS WAY TOO VALUABLE FOR US TO
LET IT SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS.

24:56.234 --> 24:58.434
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, WE ONLY
HAVE ONE-THIRD OF THE EQUATION.

24:58.534 --> 25:00.467
<i>I'M GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT WHAT WE GOT.</i>

25:00.567 --> 25:04.467

SOMETHING THAT COULD LEAD US
TO THE LAST PAINTING.

25:04.567 --> 25:07.968
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS, IS WHY DID THE DOMINION LIE
TO US IN THE FIRST PLACE, RIGHT?

25:08.067 --> 25:09.868
THEY... THEY SAID THIS...

25:09.968 --> 25:12.267
THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD
JEOPARDISE WORLD SECURITY.

25:12.367 --> 25:15.033
WELL, EVERYTHING ALWAYS
BOILS DOWN TO MONEY.

25:15.133 --> 25:18.667
HUH, I DON'T KNOW WHO
TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.868
BUT I DO PLAN ON
ASKING SOME QUESTIONS.

25:20.968 --> 25:22.634
HEY, NOT SO FAST.

25:22.734 --> 25:25.400
LEXA'S THE ONLY ONE WITH AN
ALL-ACCESS PASS TO THE DOMINION.

25:25.501 --> 25:27.434
WELL, MAYBE WE ADD
OUR NAME TO THE LIST.

25:27.534 --> 25:28.734
NO, IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.434
WE NEED ACCESS CODES.

25:30.534 --> 25:33.934
I MEAN, CALLING THE DOMINION
ISN'T LIKE PICKING UP THE PHONE
AND DIALING 911.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.434
WELL, IF WE CAN'T CALL
THEM, MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
THEM TO CALL US.

25:42.467 --> 25:44.567
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS PLACE
WAS LIKE GETTING INTO FORT KNOX.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.501
IT IS.

25:46.601 --> 25:50.567
FORTUNATELY, WHAT WE'RE
HERE FOR IS A LOT EASIER TO MOVE
THAN TWO TON OF GOLD BULLION.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.868
HOW MANY MEN DOES
SLAVA KEEP ON STAFF?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.133
NOT SURE.

25:54.234 --> 25:56.167
NO ONE'S EVER MADE
IT OUT ALIVE.

25:56.267 --> 25:57.734
GOOD.

25:57.834 --> 26:00.634
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING THE FIRST.

26:05.968 --> 26:07.801
YOU REALLY ARE
FEARLESS.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.400
IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO PLAY IT.

26:13.133 --> 26:19.167
WHAT I WOULD GIVE TO CAPTURE
THAT PASSION ON CANVAS.

26:19.267 --> 26:22.434
I'M SURE YOU WOULD.

26:28.133 --> 26:31.367

26:38.267 --> 26:42.033
YEAH.

26:45.567 --> 26:47.501
THIS BETTER BE GOOD,
JESS. I'M WORKING HERE.

26:47.601 --> 26:48.601
YEAH.

26:48.701 --> 26:50.267
YOUR BOYFRIEND PULLED
A FAST ONE ON US.

26:50.367 --> 26:51.634
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:51.734 --> 26:52.767
WELL, HE SWITCHED THE PAINTINGS.

26:52.868 --> 26:55.033
I'M LOOKING AT A COUNTERFEIT.

26:55.133 --> 26:57.467
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
- OH, IT IS.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.234
I JUST RE-SCANNED IT.

26:59.334 --> 27:01.234
<i>NOW YOU TRY AND TELL ME IF

ALL TURNED AROUND.</i>

27:01.334 --> 27:02.400
YOU'RE WRONG.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.367
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THEN YOU EXPLAIN IT,

27:04.467 --> 27:05.667
BECAUSE THE LEXA I KNOW
WOULDN'T DROP HER GUARD
FOR A MINUTE

27:05.767 --> 27:07.267

27:07.367 --> 27:08.467
LET IT GO, JESS.

27:08.567 --> 27:09.534
I'LL GET IT BACK.

27:09.634 --> 27:12.400
HOW?

27:12.501 --> 27:13.901
I GOT IT COVERED.

27:20.834 --> 27:23.133
[SIGHS]
SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING DOWN THERE, BABE?

27:23.234 --> 27:24.734
I MEAN, WE CAN CALL JESSE.

27:24.834 --> 27:26.834
OH, JESSE, JESSE, JESSE.

27:26.934 --> 27:29.968
MAN, I MEAN, HE'S NOT THE ONLY
ONE WITH A BRAIN AROUND HERE.

27:30.067 --> 27:33.367
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU DON'T EXACTLY HAVE
A DEGREE IN ELECTRONICS.

27:33.467 --> 27:36.734
OOH, HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.667
THAT'S MY DIPLOMA, OKAY?

27:38.767 --> 27:41.434
LOOK, ALL I'M TRYING
TO DO IS TRIGGER AN ALARM
IN THE ENCRYPTION DEVICE.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.300
THAT'LL GIVE THEM A
REASON TO RESPOND.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.501
[ALARM]

27:47.601 --> 27:49.234
NICE WORK.

27:51.801 --> 27:54.801
<i>WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?</i>

27:54.901 --> 27:56.067
WE NEED TO TALK.

27:56.167 --> 27:57.300
WE WANT SOME ANSWERS.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.901
<i>THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.</i>

27:59.000 --> 28:00.667
OH, IT IS NOW, CHIEF.

28:00.767 --> 28:05.000
UNLESS YOU WANT WHATEVER
IT IS WE FIND PUBLISHED
IN THE DAILY TIMES.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.934
<i>WHAT IS IT THAT YOU REQUIRE?</i>

28:07.033 --> 28:08.534
A FACE TO FACE.

28:08.634 --> 28:11.067
WE'VE GOT QUESTIONS.
YOU'VE GOT ANSWERS.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.434
<i>TWO HOURS.</i>

28:12.534 --> 28:15.067
<i>THE ALLEY BETWEEN
DIVISION AND THIRD.</i>

28:16.567 --> 28:18.434
WELL, THAT WASN'T
SO DIFFICULT.

28:18.534 --> 28:21.033
THAT'S WHAT
WORRIES ME.

28:43.934 --> 28:45.767
THAT HURTS.

28:45.868 --> 28:47.667
SORRY.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.334
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

29:01.801 --> 29:04.767
THERE, ALL BETTER.

29:07.901 --> 29:13.234
SO, UM, WHILE WE'RE ON
THE SUBJECT OF TRUST...

29:13.334 --> 29:18.133
WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME YOU STOLE MY PAINTING?

29:18.234 --> 29:20.667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.734
LET'S TRY THIS ONCE AGAIN.

29:23.834 --> 29:26.934
OR ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
SOME FREE LASER SURGERY?

29:28.434 --> 29:32.334
HEY, YOU DO IT,
AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE ANY
OF THOSE PAINTINGS AGAIN.

29:44.133 --> 29:46.367
I TAKE IT
WE'RE PARTNERS?

29:46.467 --> 29:48.133
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:48.234 --> 29:51.234
SPLITTING EVERYTHING
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

29:53.267 --> 29:55.367
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO HEAR.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.934
THIS WAS A VERY RISKY
MANEUVER ON YOUR PART.

30:22.033 --> 30:24.667
I ASSUME MISS PIERCE HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ACTIONS.

30:24.767 --> 30:26.100
WE DON'T ANSWER TO HER.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.701
CLEARLY.

30:27.801 --> 30:30.901
IT WAS FOOLISH TO SUGGEST
YOU WOULD REVEAL THE
FORMULA TO THE WORLD.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.901
WE DON'T TAKE
KINDLY TO BLACKMAIL.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.501
YOU LIED TO US.

30:34.601 --> 30:37.367
YOU SAID THIS WAS A THREAT
TO NATIONAL SECURITY.

30:37.467 --> 30:40.567
WE ANTICIPATED
YOUR RESPONSE TO THE
REAL NATURE OF THE TECHNOLOGY

30:40.667 --> 30:42.968
AND TOLD YOU WHAT
YOU NEEDED TO DO THE JOB.

30:43.067 --> 30:45.367
AT LEAST YOU ADMIT THAT
YOU TRIED TO PLAY US.

30:45.467 --> 30:46.801
WE DIRECTED YOU.

30:46.901 --> 30:48.834
THAT'S OUR ROLE.

30:48.934 --> 30:52.534
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN IF YOU RELEASED THAT
FORMULA?

30:52.634 --> 30:54.100
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.567
THE WORLD WOULD HAVE AN ENDLESS
SUPPLY OF POLLUTION-FREE FUEL?

30:56.667 --> 30:58.968
AND THE IMPACT OF THAT
TECHNOLOGY WOULD CAUSE A SHIFT

30:59.067 --> 31:01.467
IN THE BALANCE OF
WORLD POWERS OVERNIGHT.

31:01.567 --> 31:03.434
WHOLE ECONOMIES COLLAPSING.

31:03.534 --> 31:08.067
DECADES OF WAR AND
MILLIONS OF LIVES LOST BEFORE
ORDER WOULD BE RESTORED.

31:08.167 --> 31:12.000
WOULD ANY OF THAT FIT INTO
THE CATEGORY OF THREAT TO
NATIONAL SECURITY?

31:12.100 --> 31:13.868
SO YOU ARE GOING TO
BURY THE FORMULA?

31:13.968 --> 31:16.701
WE WILL RELEASE IT WHEN
THE WORLD IS READY.

31:16.801 --> 31:19.667
THESE KINDS OF CHANGES
TAKE CAREFUL PLANNING.

31:19.767 --> 31:22.334
THE DOMINION HAS CONTROLLED THE
EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY

31:22.434 --> 31:23.734
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.167
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

31:27.734 --> 31:29.100
THINK AGAIN.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.334
I DIDN'T SIGN ON
TO BE YOUR PUPPET.

31:31.434 --> 31:34.334
SO YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW FROM NOW ON.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.000
YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO MAKE DEMANDS.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.000
I'LL ADVISE YOU TO
BACK AWAY SLOWLY.

31:40.100 --> 31:45.601
THERE ARE TEN WEAPONS
SIGHTED ON YOU RIGHT NOW.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.400
FIGURE HE WAS
TELLING THE TRUTH?

31:54.501 --> 31:56.234
DOESN'T MATTER.

31:56.334 --> 31:58.634
FIRST WE GOT TO FOCUS ON
FINDING THOSE OTHER PAINTINGS.

31:58.734 --> 32:00.934
WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT
TO DO WITH THEM LATER.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.734
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

32:08.834 --> 32:11.501
[SIGHS]
DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.467
YEAH.

32:16.567 --> 32:17.767
I KNOW.

32:17.868 --> 32:20.000
SO HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET THE PAINTINGS?

32:20.100 --> 32:21.868
RIGHT AFTER
THE JOB TONIGHT.

32:21.968 --> 32:24.334
I ATTACHED A TRACKER TO
THE BACK OF HIS EARLOBE.

32:24.434 --> 32:26.267
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

32:26.367 --> 32:28.267
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

32:28.367 --> 32:29.534
I'M SURE YOU DON'T.

32:29.634 --> 32:31.634
JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON
HIS EVERY MOVE, OKAY?

32:31.734 --> 32:33.601
OH, I INTEND TO.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.033
HERE WE GO.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.234
SURE MAKES GETTING
AROUND EASY, HUH?

32:50.334 --> 32:51.534
YEAH.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.534
THE PAINTING IS IN THE
SECOND LEVEL STUDY.

32:53.634 --> 32:56.567
YEAH, WE HAVE TO GET PAST
THE GUARD STATION FIRST.

32:56.667 --> 32:58.534
EXACTLY.

32:58.634 --> 32:59.434
YOU READY TO MOVE?

32:59.534 --> 33:01.567
YEAH.

33:01.667 --> 33:02.634
WHAT'S THAT?

33:02.734 --> 33:05.000
[DOG BARKING]

33:08.834 --> 33:10.033
TASHA!

33:10.133 --> 33:11.200
WHAT ARE YOU BARKING AT?

33:11.300 --> 33:12.667
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

33:12.767 --> 33:14.934
COME ON, THERE IS NOTHING THERE.

33:15.033 --> 33:17.434
COME ON.

33:17.534 --> 33:20.667
[DOG BARKING]

33:20.767 --> 33:22.634
YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT A DOG.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.000
THAT A PROBLEM?

33:24.100 --> 33:25.067
YEAH.

33:25.167 --> 33:28.367
I DON'T DO DOG.

33:28.467 --> 33:31.100
LEX, I'VE HACKED
THE SECURITY SYSTEM

33:31.200 --> 33:32.868
YOU GOT A GUARD
UP AHEAD OF YOU.

33:32.968 --> 33:35.334
TEN METRES AWAY.

33:35.434 --> 33:36.601
SECOND FLOOR
SHOULD BE CLEAR.

33:36.701 --> 33:37.834
WELL, GUESS AGAIN.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.133
THERE'S A GUARD
HEADING OUR WAY.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.334
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

33:40.434 --> 33:42.601
GIRL'S GOTTA HAVE
HER LITTLE SECRETS.

33:56.033 --> 33:57.734
NOW THE HARD PART.

33:57.834 --> 33:59.968
THE PAINTING'S PROTECTED
BY A HIGH END LASER SYSTEM.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.567
A STRONG BREEZE
COULD TRIGGER IT.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.667
JUST LET ME IN. I'LL
TAKE CARE OF THE REST.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.766
CAN YOU HANDLE IT?

34:29.868 --> 34:31.868
OF COURSE.
JUST STAY WITH ME.

34:31.967 --> 34:34.634
I'D LOVE TO.

35:09.567 --> 35:11.601
BRENNAN, KEEP AN
EYE ON LEXA.

35:11.701 --> 35:13.834
I DON'T TRUST THIS GUY
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE HIM.

35:13.934 --> 35:16.400
I HEAR YOU.
WE'RE ON IT.

35:41.334 --> 35:43.167
[ALARM]

35:43.267 --> 35:45.234
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:45.334 --> 35:47.234
SORRY, ANGEL.

35:47.334 --> 35:50.434
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

35:50.534 --> 35:52.868
TRUST ME, I'LL BE
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

35:52.968 --> 36:02.667
[ALARM]

36:02.767 --> 36:05.100
GUYS, I NEED HELP HERE QUICK.

36:19.033 --> 36:22.400
GONE!

36:26.734 --> 36:29.200
WHAT THE HELL?

36:36.400 --> 36:38.734
GUYS, WE GOTTA GO.

37:06.033 --> 37:07.501
DID YOU GET IT?

37:07.601 --> 37:11.767
ONE DOWN,
AND TWO TO GO.

37:17.734 --> 37:19.767
WHERE'S BLAKE?

37:19.868 --> 37:21.834
HE'S ON HIS WAY TO
THE TRAIN STATION.

37:21.934 --> 37:23.934
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MAKE
SURE HE HAS SOME COMPANY?

37:24.033 --> 37:26.434
OH, YEAH.

37:44.033 --> 37:47.100
LOOKS LIKE THE FOURTH ONE
FROM THE RIGHT, TOP ROW.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.400
FOUR?

37:52.167 --> 37:54.133
I'M SORRY.

37:54.234 --> 37:57.200
I'M NOT USUALLY
THIS CLUMSY.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.100
NO PROBLEM.

38:17.801 --> 38:20.133
WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING ME A HAND?

38:20.234 --> 38:22.267
OF COURSE.

38:29.033 --> 38:31.067
THANKS.

38:31.167 --> 38:32.801
HAVE WE MET?

38:35.067 --> 38:37.634
I DON'T THINK SO.

38:42.067 --> 38:45.734
MAYBE I'LL BUMP INTO
YOU AGAIN SOME TIME.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.868
IT'S DONE.

39:13.300 --> 39:15.868
DECADES OF WAR AND
MILLIONS OF DEATHS.

39:15.968 --> 39:18.267
FOR A SAFE, NON-POLLUTING FUEL.

39:18.367 --> 39:21.067
[SIGHS] WELL, WHAT
DO WE DO WITH THEM?

39:21.167 --> 39:22.934
TOUGH DECISION.

39:23.033 --> 39:25.467
I KNOW WHAT LEXA'S
VOTE WOULD BE, THOUGH.

39:25.567 --> 39:27.434
YEAH.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.667
I SAY WE HOLD ONTO IT.

39:29.767 --> 39:32.501
HMM
MM MM. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION.

39:32.601 --> 39:35.100
WELL, THEN, WE GET IT.
- NOPE.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.133
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
GIVE IT TO THE DOMINION.

39:37.234 --> 39:39.367
LOOK, I TALKED TO
SHALIMAR. SHE AGREES.

39:39.467 --> 39:41.067
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO TRUST THEM.

39:41.167 --> 39:45.701
BUT, WE WILL MAKE A COPY OF IT
FOR HERE IN SANCTUARY,
JUST IN CASE.

40:00.767 --> 40:02.968
NO HARD FEELINGS,
I HOPE?

40:04.634 --> 40:06.968
DIDN'T EXPECT TO
SEE YOU SO SOON.

40:07.067 --> 40:08.534
AFTER YOU TRIED
TO KILL ME?

40:08.634 --> 40:12.100
PLEASE - I KNEW YOU COULD
TAKE 'EM IN YOUR SLEEP.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.467
I JUST TRIED TO SLOW YOU
DOWN, BUT I COULDN'T
EVEN MANAGE THAT, COULD I?

40:18.567 --> 40:22.067
MY BUYER WASN'T TOO PLEASED
WITH THE FAKE YOU GAVE ME.

40:22.167 --> 40:23.934
NICE WORK.

40:24.033 --> 40:26.267
IT'S A LUCKY THING
YOU GOT OUT ALIVE.

40:26.367 --> 40:28.467
SO WE'RE EVEN.

40:35.467 --> 40:36.734
HERE.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.934
I HAVE A PARTING GIFT.

40:40.033 --> 40:44.667
IT'S HOW WE FOUND YOU.

40:44.767 --> 40:46.868
MAYBE I'LL KEEP IT.

40:46.968 --> 40:50.200
IN CASE YOU EVER WANT
TO FIND ME AGAIN.

40:50.300 --> 40:53.601
OH, I'LL BE BACK.

40:56.133 --> 40:57.968
REALLY?

40:58.067 --> 40:59.634
YEAH.

40:59.734 --> 41:05.067
THERE'S A LITTLE PAINTING
OVER HERE I'M JUST DYING TO
ADD TO MY COLLECTION.

41:10.567 --> 41:12.334
WELL, WE COULD ALWAYS -

41:22.434 --> 41:23.634
[BEEPS]

41:23.734 --> 41:26.868
<i>HELLO, SHALIMAR.</i>

41:26.968 --> 41:32.968
<i>YOU'VE CHOSEN TO
TRUST THE DOMINION.</i>

41:33.067 --> 41:35.200
YOU TELLING ME THAT WAS
THE WRONG THING TO DO?

41:35.300 --> 41:40.400
<i>AS FAR AS I KNOW AT THIS POINT,
IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE.</i>

41:40.501 --> 41:42.868
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME THAT TO START WITH?

41:42.968 --> 41:45.434
<i>I DID NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.</i>

41:45.534 --> 41:48.434
<i>YOU NEEDED TO DISCOVER
THE TRUTH ON YOUR OWN.</i>

41:48.534 --> 41:50.767
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT I NEED?

41:50.868 --> 41:52.634
<i>PATIENCE, SHALIMAR.</i>

41:52.734 --> 41:55.067
<i>YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.</i>

41:55.167 --> 41:58.000
NEXT TIME WE SPEAK,
IT'LL BE IN PERSON.

42:02.834 --> 42:05.968
FINE.

42:06.067 --> 42:09.067
