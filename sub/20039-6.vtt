00:06.800 --> 00:09.733
**

00:16.000 --> 00:18.700
(George)
Hector!

00:18.700 --> 00:21.600
Not Amir's wife.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.900
What you doing, dude?

00:23.900 --> 00:25.233
Of course.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.767
I'm not ashamed.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.700
Oh, we know.

00:29.700 --> 00:30.767
Damn, what...

00:30.767 --> 00:32.133
What the hell are
you doing, Hector?

00:32.133 --> 00:34.167
I think they called it
second base in your day.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.867
Okay, very funny.
Listen, here's the thing.

00:35.867 --> 00:38.933
You don't go messing with
the women at work, okay?

00:38.933 --> 00:41.067
You ever hear the expression
you don't shit where you eat?

00:41.067 --> 00:42.433
Well, you really don't shit

00:42.433 --> 00:44.367
where I pay almost $3,000
a month to play golf.

00:44.367 --> 00:45.833
Well, where do you
want me to...

00:45.833 --> 00:46.967
(quietly whistles)

00:46.967 --> 00:48.433
It's not that.

00:48.433 --> 00:51.067
This is a life lesson, okay?
You don't have sex at work.

00:51.067 --> 00:52.467
Okay, you know
Helen right there?

00:52.467 --> 00:54.233
You know what they
call her here at the club?

00:54.233 --> 00:56.700
The 19th hole.
The 19th...

00:56.700 --> 00:58.267
Oh!
Yes.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.333
It's kind of funny.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.733
There's a lot
of writers here.

01:00.733 --> 01:01.933
But here's the thing.

01:01.933 --> 01:03.367
She's trouble and she's
looking for trouble.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.633
And you don't need trouble.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.467
No! That's how
I get into trouble...

01:07.467 --> 01:09.667
I can't help it,
George, you know?

01:09.667 --> 01:11.133
MILFs, cougars...

01:11.133 --> 01:12.467
They can't keep
their hands off me.

01:12.467 --> 01:13.733
I know, listen,
you're a handsome guy.

01:13.733 --> 01:15.200
Okay, but you got
a great opportunity here.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.067
And I don't wanna
see you mess it up.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.133
So, you want me
to stop having sex
with Helen at the club?

01:19.133 --> 01:20.667
You're already having
sex at the club?!

01:20.667 --> 01:22.567
No, no, mostly in
the walk-in refrigerator,

01:22.567 --> 01:24.233
and a few times in the--
in the pool shed.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.467
Nowhere.
Don't have sex anywhere, okay?

01:26.467 --> 01:28.600
Sorry I let you down.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.133
You didn't let me down,
but here's the thing, man.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.667
A job is very important.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.233
You gotta do whatever
you can do to protect it.

01:33.233 --> 01:35.133
How'd you learn that?

01:35.133 --> 01:36.700
I learned it the hard way,
by my mistakes!

01:36.700 --> 01:39.800
I wasn't like you
having sex with
everybody, all right?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.467
I learned it by AM radio.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.133
That's what you probably
need to get, an AM radio.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.300
Keeps you calm.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.733
And wear a condom
all the time.

01:45.733 --> 01:46.967
Like, all the time!

01:46.967 --> 01:48.467
Come on, I'll give
you a ride home, cochino.

01:48.467 --> 01:51.400
**

01:53.267 --> 01:55.600
So you don't want me
working at the club anymore?

01:55.600 --> 01:58.200
No, there's too many
bad influences there.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.800
I shoulda known.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.800
Think I just want
you to stick with me
for right now.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.233
It's a really
nice club, though.

02:04.233 --> 02:05.533
Yeah, of course,
come on.

02:05.533 --> 02:08.467
**

02:12.933 --> 02:15.400
(door closes)

02:15.400 --> 02:16.867
Oh, man, I can't get used
to you in those glasses.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.167
What'd your
optometrist say?

02:18.167 --> 02:19.267
You have to look like
an idiot the whole time?

02:19.267 --> 02:21.267
Only if I wanna see.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.633
You know,
I was thinking...

02:22.633 --> 02:24.100
You know that restaurant,
the Odyssey,

02:24.100 --> 02:25.400
that overlooks
the Valley?

02:25.400 --> 02:27.067
I'm thinking about
using that place

02:27.067 --> 02:29.500
as, like, the headquarters for
my character on my new show.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.067
I gotta get this thing
rolling already, though.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.567
It must be
frustrating, jefe.

02:32.567 --> 02:36.267
Yeah, but, you know, I still
have the grill to work on.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.767
All right.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.533
(doorbell rings)

02:43.533 --> 02:48.367
Hector? Get the door!

02:48.367 --> 02:50.633
(doorbell chimes)

02:50.633 --> 02:53.200
Is somebody gonna
get the door?!

02:53.200 --> 02:54.567
Come on.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.067
(Manolo)
They're gonna see you!

02:56.067 --> 02:57.100
Anybody gonna
get the door?

02:57.100 --> 02:58.167
Get down!

02:58.167 --> 02:59.800
What do you mean
"get down?"

02:59.800 --> 03:01.900
What are you guys doing?

03:01.900 --> 03:03.400
Oh, man.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.467
Those friends
of yours, Hector?

03:04.467 --> 03:06.133
(doorbell chimes)
No!

03:06.133 --> 03:07.867
(man at door)
Manolo! Hector!

03:07.867 --> 03:11.200
Have you heard the good
new about Jesus Christ?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.700
Oh, man, Triumph Seekers?

03:12.700 --> 03:14.767
Man, those the dudes
that got Mike.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.067
He was never the same.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.300
Stopped drinking
and got married.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.867
He had kids,
destroyed him.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.500
When I was getting out,
they said they'll find me.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.067
And keep me from straying.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.600
Did you pray with them?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.333
They were in the yard.
hey seemed okay at the time.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.600
That's all right, I think
they're leaving, hang on.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.167
We're clear.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.800
(exhales)
Listen, I love Jesus a lot.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.100
Those guys go overboard.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.167
I love Jesus.
I even have a tattoo of Him.

03:40.167 --> 03:41.367
But those guys are hardcore.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.767
All they wanna do
is love Jesus.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.567
They're persuasive,
too, like, when they talk,

03:44.567 --> 03:46.400
they got, like,
hypnotic powers.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.733
Mike, remember that
time they had him?

03:47.733 --> 03:49.100
Holding up traffic,
grabbing that cross

03:49.100 --> 03:50.267
out in the middle
of the street?

03:50.267 --> 03:51.967
They seem so at peace,
it's unsettling.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.233
They-- they say
masturbating's a sin.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.467
Is that true, George?

03:56.467 --> 03:57.767
You know, I can
understand the question,

03:57.767 --> 04:00.267
because a lot of people
your age, gamers,

04:00.267 --> 04:02.433
that's a big concern
they have.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.100
I would say
don't abuse it.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.533
And don't...
in Erica's room,

04:06.533 --> 04:07.633
'cause that's a sin
in the house,

04:07.633 --> 04:09.500
like a-- like a house sin.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.133
Hey, what are you doing?

04:16.133 --> 04:18.067
Nothing, just thinking.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.900
Well, would you mind,
uh, thinking without
those glasses on?

04:20.900 --> 04:22.300
Then I can't read.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.200
You know, ever since I
got these glasses,

04:24.200 --> 04:25.833
I've been reading
recreationally.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.733
That's what Wendy
calls reading for fun.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.067
Congratulations,
but you know what?

04:29.067 --> 04:30.733
Those glasses make you
look pompous.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.700
And if I didn't know you,
and we weren't tight,

04:32.700 --> 04:35.233
I'd probably get another
dude probably jack
that chain off your neck.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.367
(knock on door)
Oh!

04:37.367 --> 04:38.867
They're back!

04:38.867 --> 04:40.833
What are you do--
Get, get, back up!

04:40.833 --> 04:42.500
What?
Your Triumph Seekers?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.233
Honestly, y'all
should not be living

04:44.233 --> 04:45.567
in such fear
of the good word.

04:45.567 --> 04:48.300
You could use a little
bit of guidance.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.467
Listen, man, don't
let 'em in the house.

04:49.467 --> 04:50.833
They're like vampires
for the Lord.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.533
Once they get in your house,
they don't leave.

04:52.533 --> 04:53.933
Well, I was raised
in the church.

04:53.933 --> 04:58.533
I know how to handle
these type of people.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.367
I'm a--
Hi.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.067
Oh.
(gasps)
You.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.533
Hey.
Great news.

05:03.533 --> 05:06.067
We are all set for
the meeting GVN.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.367
Oh, wow, that's great.

05:07.367 --> 05:08.867
And I did
some due diligence.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.333
This is the best
shopping network on TV.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.500
It's owned by this
one woman, Lori Strahan.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.567
She built it
from the ground up,

05:13.567 --> 05:15.233
and now
she's a billionaire.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.500
Anyway, her VP of Marketing's
gonna be in the meeting,

05:17.500 --> 05:19.433
and he can pull the trigger.
Wow, that's amazing.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.167
Hey, what about "Valleys"?
Any word on that?

05:21.167 --> 05:23.700
We are getting close
to locking down a VBDW.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.400
Well, what--
what's a VBDW?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.567
A "very big
deal writer", George.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.800
Wow, that's great,
Olly, nice work.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.067
(alert pings)
Pfeiffer?

05:32.067 --> 05:35.433
No! No!
(exhales)

05:35.433 --> 05:37.867
George, do you
have a Dr. Pepper?
Pfeiffer's thirsty.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.800
I don't-- I have to check.
Where is she?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.067
I made her wait in the car.
Oh.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.400
(alert pings)

05:43.400 --> 05:45.133
Oh, definitely no!

05:45.133 --> 05:46.600
Jason just wants
a quickie!

05:46.600 --> 05:48.233
Don't you want him in
a good mood for the pitch?

05:48.233 --> 05:50.533
Wait a minute, that's not
Jason, our network
executive, is it?

05:50.533 --> 05:52.833
Yes...
that's that Jason.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.433
Your-- your sister
is having sex with Jason,

05:54.433 --> 05:55.900
our network executive?

05:55.900 --> 06:00.600
That can't be good.
Or could it be very good?

06:00.600 --> 06:02.733
Okay, I don't see it,
but just to be safe,

06:02.733 --> 06:05.500
make sure that your sister
keeps having sex with him.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.067
Will do.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.767
The Smith Goldberg
sisters are on the case.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.400
I didn't say you,
I said her.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.867
Hmm, right, good.

06:11.867 --> 06:13.567
To be clear, I'm not
having sex with anyone.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.067
Fantastic, let me see
if I got a Dr. Pepper.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.433
**

06:17.433 --> 06:19.800
But just let him
meet with George.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.400
What? So, that's
the fifth writer
at your agency

06:22.400 --> 06:25.867
who's become unavailable
while we're on the phone.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.367
No, I'm not
calling you a liar,

06:27.367 --> 06:30.100
but I think
we can agree
you are ly-ing!

06:30.100 --> 06:33.700
Ugh! I'm not getting
anywhere with these
stupid agents.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.533
I need to talk directly
to the writers.

06:35.533 --> 06:38.100
Why don't you just
slide into their DMs?

06:38.100 --> 06:39.567
Don't try to out hip me.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.333
I was the youngest
manager at Four Arts.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.933
So you know what
I'm talking about?

06:42.933 --> 06:44.167
No.
Okay.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.800
A DM is a Direct Message.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.400
Anytime I wanna
bone someone fancy,

06:47.400 --> 06:49.200
I just find their Twitter,
their Instagram,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.200
their Twitch, whatever
and send 'em a message.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.433
They respond because it's
seen as personal connection.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.967
Except I don't
want to bone them.

06:54.967 --> 06:57.333
Yeah! They don't
know that, though.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.833
And they'll respond
and then pretend

06:58.833 --> 07:00.833
like they didn't just
think you wanted to bone.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.667
Hmph.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.800
That's actually
worth a try.
Mm-hmm.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.533
But your boning
could be

07:06.533 --> 07:07.867
a little bit of
a problem for me.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.233
Yeah? But you're already
having sex with Jason,

07:10.233 --> 07:11.567
so keep doing that.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.067
Finish what you
started and everything.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.567
But just don't bone
anyone else that

07:14.567 --> 07:15.967
I'm trying to do
business with, okay?

07:15.967 --> 07:17.300
Does that make sense?
Yeppers.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.067
Okay.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.400
If this DM things works,
I might consider loving you.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.067
(loud smack)

07:23.067 --> 07:24.467
(grunts)

07:24.467 --> 07:25.867
**

07:25.867 --> 07:29.833
Mr. Lopez, we are all
huge fans

07:29.833 --> 07:32.633
and are very excited
about your product idea.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.333
Oh, thank you so much,
you know, I...

07:34.333 --> 07:36.700
I was hoping
I would be better
prepared, but, uh...

07:36.700 --> 07:38.200
Hey, what does
this do?

07:38.200 --> 07:39.200
Makes the perfect omelet.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.667
Oh, what about this?

07:40.667 --> 07:41.933
Makes the perfect waffle.

07:41.933 --> 07:43.833
Yeah, well,
I don't have...

07:43.833 --> 07:45.067
uh, actually have
any grills made.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.233
I wanted to before
we met, but, um...

07:47.233 --> 07:49.200
Not a problem.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.900
Miss Strahan, uh...

07:50.900 --> 07:53.633
We had no idea you were
even in the country.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.567
I wasn't, until
I heard George Lopez

07:55.567 --> 07:57.067
was coming
for a meeting.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.767
Wow.

07:58.767 --> 08:01.700
Okay, well, welcome, uh...
Can I pitch my grill now?

08:01.700 --> 08:03.367
George, you don't
need to sell me.

08:03.367 --> 08:05.533
I'm a very big fan.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.267
Wait a minute, is that
a World Series ring?

08:13.267 --> 08:14.500
'88 Dodgers.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.667
I thought you'd
never notice.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.067
Kirk Gibson
gave it to me.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.700
So you're a Kirk Gibson fan
or are you a Dodger fan?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.867
Oh, no,
I bleed Dodger blue.

08:21.867 --> 08:24.967
Now, can I have
my hand back?

08:24.967 --> 08:27.067
Oh, yes, of course,
I'm sorry.

08:27.067 --> 08:29.233
(all chuckling)

08:29.233 --> 08:31.267
I know you're
a big Dodger fan.

08:31.267 --> 08:32.967
Who do you hate more?
The Giants or Donald Trump?

08:32.967 --> 08:35.067
Oh, wow, that's, uh...
(clearing throat)

08:35.067 --> 08:36.867
Wow, Donald Trump's
not in our division.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.567
But I think I have enough
hate for Donald Trump

08:39.567 --> 08:41.667
and the San Francisco Giants

08:41.667 --> 08:43.600
and a little left over,
you know, for "The Wall."

08:43.600 --> 08:47.600
(laughter)

08:47.600 --> 08:49.500
I don't believe you.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.233
Oh, believe him.
He does.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.267
Who is this?

08:53.267 --> 08:55.567
I'm Hector,
Hector Lopez.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.467
Not his son.
No, he's not my son.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.333
He's just, uh, hanging
out with us today.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.733
Everybody have a seat.

09:01.733 --> 09:04.200
Uh, not you.
I'm taking you on a tour.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.933
Show you what
you're getting into.

09:05.933 --> 09:07.967
Oh, all right.
Follow me.

09:07.967 --> 09:09.367
I have to get out more.

09:09.367 --> 09:10.667
Like, I'm having trouble
coming up with stuff

09:10.667 --> 09:13.133
that piss me off
for my rants.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.733
If I put on Fox News, I'm sure
something will come up.

09:15.733 --> 09:17.067
You can't!
Why?

09:17.067 --> 09:20.833
George put a block on it.
When? What?

09:20.833 --> 09:22.767
Man, this stuff
is hard, bro.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.900
And so much of it.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.833
Math, History, English.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.233
It's really killing me.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.333
You'll do great, but not
if you stress yourself out.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.833
You need to blow
off some steam.
Really?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.667
Yup, and I know
just the place.

09:34.667 --> 09:35.833
I'm taking you down
to where they call

09:35.833 --> 09:37.833
Rodeo Drive "ro-dee-oh."

09:37.833 --> 09:39.400
Get your phone, let's go.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.700
You like black people?
Yeah.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.233
A lot of 'em?
Yeah.

09:42.233 --> 09:45.633
It doesn't look like much,
but it gets the job done.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.733
I sell for dough
not for show.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.100
You sound like a golfer.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.067
Drive for show
and putt for dough.

09:51.067 --> 09:53.500
I know my way
around the links.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.933
In fact, I sold four million
Caddy Daddies last year.

09:56.933 --> 09:58.633
Oh, that was you?
Mm-hmm.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.100
Wow, me and my friends
all have those.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.933
Now this is Studio One.
That'll be yours.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.800
The control room
is right there.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.733
Call stations are
throughout the building

10:06.733 --> 10:10.433
so when you make your CTA,
we have all hands on deck
to take orders.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.233
Okay, uh, CTA?

10:12.233 --> 10:14.067
CTA, "Call To Action."

10:14.067 --> 10:15.633
That's when you
tell your viewers

10:15.633 --> 10:17.467
to pick up the phone
and order.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.933
If they don't, they might
just sit back and watch you.

10:20.933 --> 10:23.400
But, George,
when you make your CTA,

10:23.400 --> 10:26.833
they will run across the room
and make those orders.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.333
How do you know that?

10:28.333 --> 10:32.100
Because I know sellers.
And you can sell.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.133
So, just... relax.
Okay.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.967
All you need to do
is show up and be you.

10:36.967 --> 10:38.767
(sighs)
Oh, all right.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.100
Well, I can do that.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.300
And I'll take care
of everything.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.333
All right.
Trust me.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.133
I trust you.

10:46.133 --> 10:47.467
I'm gonna show
you something else.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.167
You're gonna love this.
Okay.

10:49.167 --> 10:52.833
**

10:52.833 --> 10:54.967
(Olly clears throat)

10:54.967 --> 10:57.167
You know, you guys don't
have to stay here with us.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.700
Yes, we do.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.333
We have not
been dismissed.

11:00.333 --> 11:04.500
Oh, Lori runs
a tight ship, huh?

11:04.500 --> 11:06.633
(phone vibrating)

11:06.633 --> 11:09.100
(clears throat)

11:09.100 --> 11:10.667
Oh! Oh!
My God, A DM reply!

11:10.667 --> 11:13.067
(gasps)
DM is Direct Message.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.933
And it works.
I love you.

11:15.933 --> 11:18.733
Thank you.
Isn't she pretty?

11:18.733 --> 11:21.800
(George)
Oh, man, wow,
that was great!

11:21.800 --> 11:23.233
Yeah, well, it's
one of those days,

11:23.233 --> 11:24.933
'cause I've got
even greater great.

11:24.933 --> 11:27.500
We've got a meeting
with our top writer,
Baxter Levy.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.667
Oh, my God,
we're rolling!

11:29.667 --> 11:31.067
Hey, isn't Lori great?

11:31.067 --> 11:34.067
I mean, like, really,
really, really impressive.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.433
Beautiful and impressive, wow!

11:36.433 --> 11:38.600
Hey, George, don't shit
where you eat, right?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.067
What are you talk--

11:40.067 --> 11:41.700
You're talking about
that, that...

11:41.700 --> 11:44.333
No! Come on, shut up.
When's the meeting?

11:44.333 --> 11:46.133
2:00.
All right, we should
loop Coco in

11:46.133 --> 11:48.367
and make sure that
she's there.
Good idea.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.500
Oh, hey.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.167
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.667
Baxter Levy
is a great writer.
Right.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.133
You know he dated Megan Fox?
And Olivia Munn?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.067
Oh, that's good to know
for the meeting and stuff.

11:59.067 --> 12:02.767
Oh, and last year's
"Bachelorette."
Oh, her too?

12:02.767 --> 12:04.367
**

12:04.367 --> 12:05.767
I want "Valleys"
to make some noise.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.300
I want it to be
visceral and real.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.300
You know, I'm a huge
fan of your work,

12:09.300 --> 12:12.067
and I think you could
take this project
to the next level.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.967
Alec Monopoly!
Ah, what's up, George?

12:13.967 --> 12:16.333
What's up, Alec?
Oh, that's Alec Monopoly.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.667
That dude's art is L.A.

12:17.667 --> 12:18.733
Oh, well, maybe
we should have you do

12:18.733 --> 12:20.433
some set designs
for "Valleys."

12:20.433 --> 12:23.167
Yeah, I'm gonna
take a break
from my museum shows.

12:23.167 --> 12:24.967
Whoops.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.400
George, I wanna
be honest with you

12:26.400 --> 12:28.833
because lying is for
liars and sociopaths.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.967
I hate everything
you've done.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.800
Well, then...
What am I doing here?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.167
When I heard
that you had Coco,

12:35.167 --> 12:37.133
I knew you were
pushing some envelopes.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.633
I like pushing
envelopes.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.133
And I like
surprising people.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.467
People are gonna say,
"Baxter, you've won Emmys.

12:42.467 --> 12:46.200
Why are you working
with George Lopez?"

12:46.200 --> 12:48.300
And then we'll show them.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.067
And then we'll turn their
perceptions inside out.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.333
All right,
that's what I'm into.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.633
That's what I'm--
So, you're in?

12:53.633 --> 12:55.233
I'm gonna take
Coco for a ride.

12:55.233 --> 12:58.667
And then we'll
talk business.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.867
(engine revs)

13:02.833 --> 13:04.567
Well, this has been
an interesting day,

13:04.567 --> 13:06.067
wouldn't you say?

13:06.067 --> 13:08.433
(hip-hop playing,
people cheering)

13:08.433 --> 13:11.533
Yeah, thanks, y'all!
Check me out on Facebook!

13:11.533 --> 13:15.767
(cheering continues)

13:15.767 --> 13:17.167
Yo, I'm not
sure I fit in.

13:17.167 --> 13:18.433
Everybody's
staring at us.

13:18.433 --> 13:19.600
Oh, it's nothing.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.800
Ay yo! Maronzio!
Dude, rant on me.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.933
Come on, something about me's
gotta piss you off!

13:24.933 --> 13:26.967
Just you having a boyfriend.

13:26.967 --> 13:31.133
Ahh! A'ight!

13:31.133 --> 13:32.767
Ay, live stream me baby!

13:32.767 --> 13:35.733
Ahh!
Hey!

13:35.733 --> 13:38.600
I think I'm breaking through
the Twittersphere, my friend!

13:38.600 --> 13:41.200
Nice!
Yeah.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.100
Yo, they got an open mic!

13:43.100 --> 13:45.067
Say what?
Get on stage!

13:45.067 --> 13:46.933
Big white boy can rap?

13:46.933 --> 13:48.567
Hey, they think
I'm white!

13:48.567 --> 13:49.933
Get on the stage!

13:49.933 --> 13:53.667
(whooping and cheering)

13:53.667 --> 13:56.800
(rapping in Spanish)

14:10.433 --> 14:11.800
Miss Wendy?!

14:11.800 --> 14:15.267
Yeah, looks like somebody
gonna get some extra credit.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.467
"Just trust me."

14:41.733 --> 14:43.867
Huh.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.100
Look at that char!
And indoors.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.867
This is a great grill.

14:50.867 --> 14:54.233
Authentic Mexican flavor
without the authentic
Mexican mess

14:54.233 --> 14:56.633
or finding an oil drum
or burning furniture

14:56.633 --> 14:58.967
for, like,
that mesquite taste.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.767
Jefe, if you don't
need me next Thursday,

15:00.767 --> 15:02.567
I was gonna go back to
open mic night and rap again.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.900
Yeah, of course.
But, listen, hey...

15:04.900 --> 15:07.067
Don't let that get in the way
of of your studies, cholo.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.233
Oh, he don't have to
worry about his studies.

15:09.233 --> 15:10.967
(chuckling)
He's right.

15:10.967 --> 15:13.100
As a matter of fact,
Wendy's already a big fan.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.333
Wendy, who?
Wendy, your GED teacher?

15:15.333 --> 15:18.133
Yeah, we stood up all night
talking and doing her nails.

15:18.133 --> 15:19.600
Let me tell you something.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.467
No, that, that, that's
a mistake, that's no good.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.433
Manolo, you can't mix
business and pleasure.

15:24.433 --> 15:26.633
I don't know why,
but George knows.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.100
I'ma tell both of you why.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.933
Because both of you guys
are convicted felons

15:29.933 --> 15:31.567
and you have
probation officers.

15:31.567 --> 15:34.767
And the last thing either
of you guys need is trouble.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.667
But we're not dating.
She's just helping me out.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.867
Manolo, I saw how
she looked at you.

15:38.867 --> 15:40.467
Serious dick eye.

15:40.467 --> 15:43.067
Listen, Manolo,
you can't date
your teacher.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.400
Why not?!
You dated your daughter!

15:44.400 --> 15:45.900
I didn't date
my daughter, all right?

15:45.900 --> 15:47.400
That was a mistake.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.800
I don't believe
in rules or boundaries.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.067
Like, take
Chandra and I.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.200
We never got married.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.867
But we never
really broke up.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.267
And she doesn't
hold me back.

15:54.267 --> 15:55.633
Save that
for the couch over there

15:55.633 --> 15:56.900
with Jerry Springer.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.967
Listen, don't listen
to this fool right here.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.100
If he was in prison,

15:59.100 --> 16:00.300
you know where
you'd see him?

16:00.300 --> 16:01.867
In the bakery,
man, crying,

16:01.867 --> 16:03.200
making his own dough
from the tears.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.600
He's a mistake
waiting to happen.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.733
I'm blowing up.

16:05.733 --> 16:07.767
Oh, my God, you made
me burn my machaca!

16:10.100 --> 16:12.367
All right, thanks,
thank you, thank you.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.433
(Lori)
George...

16:14.433 --> 16:15.500
Oh, when do we
start rehearsing?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.133
Oh, we go live
in five minutes.

16:17.133 --> 16:20.333
What?
George, I want
you to be you.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.433
I want it to be honest,
and I want it to be real

16:22.433 --> 16:24.067
because I know
you can sell.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.533
Okay, damn right
I can sell.

16:26.533 --> 16:29.167
The only thing I don't want
you to do is hump the price.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.267
The star never humps
the price.

16:31.267 --> 16:32.300
I'm sorry, can you--
I got this.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.467
Can you say it again?

16:33.467 --> 16:35.467
The star never
humps the price.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.267
It demeans the star
and the product.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.067
Right.
Who does hump the price?

16:39.067 --> 16:41.200
Your co-host.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.567
Who's my co-host?

16:42.567 --> 16:44.700
Well, 70% of our
audience is women,

16:44.700 --> 16:47.567
so we want someone
with energy and charisma

16:47.567 --> 16:50.500
and someone who is
drop-dead gorgeous.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.067
Him.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.767
Me?

16:54.767 --> 16:56.500
Him?
I can't do this.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.600
Yes, you can.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.067
And you are going
to be great.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.233
Trust me.

17:02.233 --> 17:04.367
**

17:15.067 --> 17:17.500
(whispering)
I'll be watching.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.067
Hi, everybody,
I'm George Lopez.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.400
And I'm here...
(chuckles)

17:27.400 --> 17:29.067
I'm here to
sell you a grill!

17:29.067 --> 17:32.067
The George Lopez
Indoor Mexican Grill

17:32.067 --> 17:35.967
from America's
favorite Mexican,
George Lopez, that's me.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.233
(bleep) yeah!

17:37.233 --> 17:38.500
Hey, man, you can't
cuss on TV.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.167
What's wrong
with you, man?

17:40.167 --> 17:42.067
George,
look in all the cameras.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.467
Yeah, uh, I've worked

17:43.467 --> 17:45.933
multi-camera situations
before, thank you.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.333
Relax, George,
sell the grill.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.400
Ah, okay, ah,
listen, everybody,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.700
this grill is great,
really great.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.767
It's almost like
cooking outdoors,

17:54.767 --> 17:57.433
indoors without
the fuss or muss.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.600
And whatever
you wanna cook.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.200
You wanna
cook carne asada.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.100
You wanna cook
pollo, chicken.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.833
Or if you wanna
cook something that's
not Mexican, I get you.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.133
You could cook a--
a grill cheese, a panini.

18:07.133 --> 18:10.100
Salmons...
you know, variations?

18:10.100 --> 18:12.133
Ahem. Is that thing
working right there?

18:12.133 --> 18:13.967
How come they're not calling,
this grill's great.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.967
And-- and the grease
goes out to the side.

18:15.967 --> 18:17.833
And it's only 39.95.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.267
It's 29.95, (bleep).

18:19.267 --> 18:21.333
Oh, man, you made me
hump my own price!

18:21.333 --> 18:23.600
You trying to tell me
it's only 29.95?!
Yeah.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.433
That's awesome!
It is.

18:25.433 --> 18:27.833
Oh, man, look,
people are calling.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.467
Now the CTA.

18:29.467 --> 18:30.833
Oh, the Call
To Action, yeah.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.500
Hey, listen, everybody
that's out there,

18:32.500 --> 18:34.300
this is a grill
that you want, okay?

18:34.300 --> 18:37.433
This is a grill,
whatever you--
cholos the cholas.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.467
Whether red or black,
Blood or Crips.

18:39.467 --> 18:42.467
Let's unite
and make it right
and let's grill tonight.

18:42.467 --> 18:45.133
Pick up the phone
and call right now.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.367
Look at this surface.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.067
It is the hardest
surface on--

18:48.067 --> 18:49.900
Well, there's something
quite resembling this.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.533
Look at that, ladies.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.067
I think you understand
what I'm talking
about, huh?

18:53.067 --> 18:54.400
Whoop-whoop!

18:54.400 --> 18:56.300
Grab a glass of wine
and pick up that phone

18:56.300 --> 18:58.067
and get those
rollover minutes.

18:58.067 --> 18:59.267
You hear 'em
right there?

18:59.267 --> 19:00.900
So, anything you can grill,

19:00.900 --> 19:02.300
you can Lopez grill.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.100
You can grill it all, yeah!

19:04.100 --> 19:05.767
Hey, listen, everybody
that's out there...

19:05.767 --> 19:08.067
Me grill!

19:08.067 --> 19:09.967
Hmph!

19:14.667 --> 19:16.600
(keypad beeping)

19:21.400 --> 19:23.800
Well, that apparently
went very well.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.267
And more people will see that
than a sitcom these days.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.233
What kind of backhanded
compliment is that?

19:28.233 --> 19:29.900
Hmm.
You were awesome, jefe.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.733
I need to get mami
one of those.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.967
Yeah, all right,
thanks, you guys.

19:33.967 --> 19:35.400
Appreciate it.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.900
I'll talk to you
later then, too.

19:38.900 --> 19:41.767
(sighs)
George...

19:41.767 --> 19:42.800
That went well, huh?

19:42.800 --> 19:45.500
We have a hit,
a real hit.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.333
I told you, trust me.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.267
You did tell me
to trust you.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.500
Guess you told Hector
to trust you too, huh?

19:51.500 --> 19:53.800
I don't know what to do
with all this trust going on.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.933
Well, maybe I can do
something about that.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.333
How's that?

19:57.333 --> 19:59.433
You'll have to trust me.

19:59.433 --> 20:02.200
Right.
Cheers.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.700
Cheers.
To you, George.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.633
To you.

20:10.633 --> 20:12.500
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

20:12.500 --> 20:14.267
* That's right, come on,
come on, come on *

20:14.267 --> 20:16.467
* Unh, yeah, yeah *

20:16.467 --> 20:18.933
* Come on, come on *

20:18.933 --> 20:20.867
**

20:27.433 --> 20:29.533
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:29.533 --> 20:31.633
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:31.633 --> 20:34.733
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:34.733 --> 20:36.867
**
