WEBVTT

00:07.475 --> 00:10.044
Oh, would you look at this.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.046
How is this even okay?

00:12.146 --> 00:15.049
They just rent these scooters
to anybody all over town,

00:15.149 --> 00:17.151
and then let them dump them
in my damn yard?

00:17.251 --> 00:19.420
(alarm sounds, stops)

00:19.520 --> 00:23.457
Oh. Okay,
so now I'm the bad guy.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.326
Tina, a little help here.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.927
Eh, looks like you got it.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.597
Hey, girl.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.432
What you reading?
Instagram?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.567
I'm just checking
Grover's location.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.104
Ooh, spying on the kid.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.639
I'm very proud of you.
Right?

00:38.739 --> 00:41.475
I thought I'd take him to see
that new movie Hannigan.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.778
The origin story about the
orphanage lady in Annie?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.047
It shows why she got so mean.

00:48.949 --> 00:52.486
Gem, our new solar panels
have charged up,

00:52.586 --> 00:54.088
and the electric company
is on their way

00:54.188 --> 00:55.589
to disconnect us
from the system.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.993
Finally, we will no longer
be prisoners of the grid.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.996
Ooh. Calvin, get excited.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.598
It's goodbye grid day.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.735
Oh, when is it gonna be
goodbye Dave day?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.438
What's wrong with you?

01:10.538 --> 01:11.705
I'm sorry, man.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.207
I just don't know
what's going on

01:13.307 --> 01:14.908
in this neighborhood anymore.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.844
They have these scooters
all in my damn yard,

01:16.944 --> 01:20.381
and then those ugly solar panels
you got on your roof.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.849
And don't get me started
about the guy

01:21.949 --> 01:23.584
that bought Reggie's house
across the street.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.486
He put in Astroturf.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.222
Sure, his yard's always
even and green,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.090
but he's cheating!

01:31.125 --> 01:32.593
I went over to introduce myself

01:32.693 --> 01:34.428
and welcome him
to the neighborhood.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.165
The fool talked to me
through his doorbell,

01:37.265 --> 01:38.799
like I was in a drive-thru.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.803
I'm Calvin Butler.
I get invited inside.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.573
You know, it used to be
there wasn't a couch

01:45.673 --> 01:49.610
in a four-block radius that
didn't know my butt personally.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.946
Now everybody just sticks
to themselves.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.383
Everybody except for that lady
that says "good morning"

01:55.483 --> 01:57.084
no matter what time
of day it is.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.721
He's just upset because
Reggie moved to Oxnard,

02:00.821 --> 02:02.390
and nobody will watch
boxing with him.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.759
No, I'm upset because
Reggie sold his house

02:05.859 --> 02:08.562
(loudly):
to the dude
with the fake-ass grass.

02:11.399 --> 02:14.101
Wow, this landscaping
is gorgeous.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.803
Oh, you like it?
Love it.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.305
I just moved in
around the corner.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.472
Hey, do you have a card?

02:18.572 --> 02:19.673
I'd love for you to come by,

02:19.773 --> 02:20.941
take a look and give me a bid.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.545
A bid?
Why would I give you a bid?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.980
I-I'm sorry,
are you not the landscaper?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.150
The landscaper?

02:33.053 --> 02:34.388
I'm Calvin Butler.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.358
I have lived her for 28 years.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.059
I got two years left
on my mortgage,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.328
just redid my kitchen,

02:40.428 --> 02:41.829
and that speed bump?
I got that put in.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.031
Yeah, people used to
just fly by here.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.334
And the dog park?

02:46.434 --> 02:47.568
You can thank me for that.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.136
And I ain't even got a dog.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.638
Good morning.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.574
It is 3:15
in the afternoon, ma'am.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.211
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

02:57.311 --> 02:58.546
* Welcome to the hood. *

03:03.351 --> 03:04.785
* Doo, do, do, doo... *

03:04.885 --> 03:05.853
Mama!

03:05.953 --> 03:09.323
Oh, hey. Here comes the bride.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.058
How's the wedding planning
coming?

03:11.158 --> 03:14.428
Well, Miss Tina,
that's what we came to tell you.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.963
Marty and I have
been thinking...

03:16.063 --> 03:18.299
Of having a beach wedding.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.802
In the sand? Outside?
Near the water?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.972
Yeah, Mom, the beach.

03:25.072 --> 03:28.542
Okay, well, I guess I'll just
return my beautiful heels

03:28.642 --> 03:30.378
and get some Crocs.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.947
Look, look, look.
Look at this, Mama.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.148
Isn't this amazing?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.617
Let me see.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.885
Ooh, baby, you're right.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.320
That is amazing.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.355
You know, do it
just like this,

03:41.455 --> 03:45.326
but in a church, with AC,
and floors.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.996
Okay.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.598
So, what are you making?

03:50.698 --> 03:53.667
My baby boy's favorite,
fried fish,

03:53.767 --> 03:56.136
with my supersecret
Tina spices.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.471
BOTH:
Ooh.
(chuckles)

03:57.571 --> 03:59.407
Sounds delicious.
Yeah.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.709
I wish I could have some,
but I'm in training,

04:01.809 --> 04:03.811
and fried food's
definitely off my menu.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.713
Oh, it's okay, I understand.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.715
Don't feel bad.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.483
That just means
more for us.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.385
(laughs)

04:12.620 --> 04:14.655
Actually, it's-it's a lot more.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.658
I'm supporting Necie by doing
her training diet with her.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.394
Turns out I like flax.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.397
Oh, that's so nice.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.334
You know,
supporting your fiancÃ©e.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.669
You know, that's how you build
a strong relationship.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.904
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
(forced chuckle)

04:31.004 --> 04:33.741
Love it, love it.
I just love it.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.111
David Johnson? I'm Thad.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.847
From Pasadena Gas
and Electric.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.515
Happy to see you.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.385
Okay.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.619
Uh...

04:45.719 --> 04:47.388
I need you to initial
a few items.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.823
Ooh, I already got a pen,
let's get this party started.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.426
Hey, there you are.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.894
I thought we might
grab a bite

04:53.994 --> 04:55.095
and go see Hannigan.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.664
The Annie movie?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.467
Yeah. Remember how we used to
put on the soundtrack

04:59.567 --> 05:01.134
and dance around with brooms?

05:01.234 --> 05:03.303
Yeah, when I was five.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.640
But don't you remember
the choreography?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.350
Okay, Gemma.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.419
It's uh...
(chuckles)

05:18.519 --> 05:21.789
Hey, uh, G-man, you have got
skills on those scooters.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.223
Wh-What are you talking about?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.692
I'm talking about you.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.326
I just drove past
you and your boys.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.395
Y'all were killing it, man.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.129
Uh, that wasn't me.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.532
A lot of people look like me.
You're seeing it more and more.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.900
(laughs)

05:33.000 --> 05:34.502
Yeah, we don't let Grover
ride those things.

05:34.602 --> 05:38.071
And I don't want to,
so I guess that settles that.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.108
Right, right. You know,
now that I think about it,

05:41.208 --> 05:43.611
your look is very popular.
(laughs)

05:43.711 --> 05:46.279
It must have been some other
little White boy that I saw.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.382
Oh, my God, it was you.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.150
It's right here on
my credit card statement.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.752
Goose E-Scooters.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.555
You lied to me.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.161
D.J. And another D.J.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.230
"This page was
intentionally left blank."

06:03.330 --> 06:04.264
Don't know what that's about.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.135
Uh, D.J., and then my full name,

06:08.235 --> 06:11.371
David Seymour Johnson.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.507
It's a family name.
I know what it sounds like.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.844
It was not fun
in fifth grade.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.812
Or when Calvin found out.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.281
Okay. Done.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.151
Now get me off of that
grid, my good man.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.586
Okay.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.392
Gem... it's happening.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.294
Did you know
your son rode on a scooter

06:34.394 --> 06:35.863
and then lied about it?

06:35.963 --> 06:37.297
Oh, really, Grover?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.833
On grid day?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.269
Thanks for ratting me out.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.171
Well, you didn't tell me
it was a secret.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.106
It was a secret from you, too!

06:46.206 --> 06:47.575
(scoffs)

06:47.675 --> 06:49.843
Looks like somebody's
a dry snitch.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.945
The driest.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.314
You don't know
what a dry snitch is, do you?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.349
No, but I would
like to learn.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.418
It's somebody who
snitches by accident.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.887
Malcolm does do that.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.221
No, I don't.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.556
It happened one time, okay?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.091
It's not like I told Grover

07:04.191 --> 07:06.093
when you backed over
his remote-controlled car.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.761
Come on.
Okay, man.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.697
Two times.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.002
Babe, I'm telling you, you don't
want to miss this fight.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.371
Ortiz has been ducking
Jackson for three years.

07:18.472 --> 07:22.075
So then Jackson started
DM-ing Ortiz's baby mama.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.310
(laughs)

07:23.410 --> 07:25.646
Oh, it got personal then.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.716
It's like one of your Housewives
shows, but not as violent.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.053
Mama's cooking is suddenly
not good enough.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.557
28 years of feeding that boy,
but what do I know?

07:37.725 --> 07:38.959
TV ANNOUNCER:
But straight to
the matchups tonight,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.494
as we get ready
for the opening bell.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.195
Ah, here we go.
(bell clangs)

07:42.295 --> 07:44.164
(electricity whooshes off)

07:44.264 --> 07:45.833
What the hell?!
Huh?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.635
My fight.
My fish.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.437
Let me see
what's going on.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.710
It looks like the power's out
across the street, too.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.746
(upbeat music playing)
Wait, do-do you hear that music?

07:58.846 --> 08:02.650
Yeah. Sounds like...
pirate music?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.151
* *

08:04.251 --> 08:06.520
Dave.
Dave.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.357
(upbeat music continues playing)

08:10.457 --> 08:12.693
* Yo-ho! *

08:13.761 --> 08:15.128
Cranking my sea shanties
too loud?

08:15.228 --> 08:18.431
Well, any volume is too loud
for shanties, Dave.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.435
But we got a bigger problem,
man. Take a look around.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.542
Oh, my God.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.878
The power's out everywhere.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.147
This is fantastic!

08:34.247 --> 08:36.584
My solar panels worked.
(scoffs)

08:36.684 --> 08:39.152
Look who's
energy-independent now.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.321
Suddenly Seymour.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.757
Well, think about it, Dave.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.525
That guy came to take
you off the grid.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.661
Uh, yeah. Thad.
And then bam!

08:47.761 --> 08:49.930
Out of nowhere,
the power's out.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.464
Oh... Thad.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.267
Uh, I suppose he could have
shorted a transformer.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.069
There's no suppose
about it. He did.

08:56.169 --> 08:59.406
Look, I was set to watch the
biggest fights of the year.

08:59.506 --> 09:03.376
I-I paid for my per,
now I want my view.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.980
Well, you know, I'm sorry,
Calvin, but face it.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.616
If you guys were off the grid,

09:08.716 --> 09:10.483
you wouldn't be
in this situation.
(laughs)

09:10.584 --> 09:12.753
Well, if you would have
stayed in Michigan,

09:12.853 --> 09:15.455
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.830
All these people
lost their power?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.798
Dave, if you know
what's good for you,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.867
I would get in there and turn
your lights off right now.
Why?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.869
Hey, uh, can I charge my phone?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.304
(laughs)
Oh, yeah. They're coming
for you, Dave.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.273
Oh, me, too.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.209
Oh, it's about
to be Hunger Games up in here.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.614
Wow. The power's out everywhere.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.449
Oh, well,
not everywhere.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.252
Well, don't worry.
Mommy has candles.
Oh.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.553
No need for candles.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.555
I've got these hand-cranked
flashlights.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.224
(laughing):
Whoa!

09:51.324 --> 09:53.093
These are way better, babe.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.094
Oh, yeah.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.529
Way better. (laughs)

09:56.630 --> 09:59.532
All right, guys.
Here we go. Ready?

10:00.333 --> 10:03.637
Uh, now, please
just use what you need.

10:03.737 --> 10:07.407
No. Sir, don't plug in
your car, please.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.479
Look at all
these credit card charges.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.481
What are all these?

10:14.581 --> 10:16.884
Uh, look, I didn't mean
to start anything, Gemma.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.820
No, no, no. It's good that I
know that I can't trust Grover.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.521
I'm so glad you snitched.

10:23.090 --> 10:28.128
(loudly):
Dave, what is
Luckytownadventures.com?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.697
Nothing!

10:29.797 --> 10:31.464
Well, uh,

10:31.564 --> 10:33.967
it's not nothing!
It's $200!

10:34.067 --> 10:36.136
Grover spent $200

10:36.236 --> 10:38.672
at Luckytownadventures.com!

10:40.741 --> 10:42.542
Wasn't Grover,
so maybe stop shouting

10:42.642 --> 10:44.411
"Luckytownadventures.com."

10:44.511 --> 10:45.979
Do you know what that is?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.480
(chuckles)
Yeah. No.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.283
Maybe. Just leave
me out of it.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.688
Gemma, remember
a couple months ago

10:54.788 --> 10:57.958
when we saw an article
about an item?

10:58.058 --> 11:00.093
One that many people found...

11:00.193 --> 11:02.262
enjoyable?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.530
An article?
Yeah.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.099
About an item?
Mm-hmm.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.001
Oh, the item?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.171
Oh. Oh.
Mm-hmm.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.740
Right. The item. Yeah.
Yeah.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.575
Uh, okay, uh,
so that wasn't Grover.
Mm-hmm.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.845
But before you get the idea that
we're freaky, it was just...

11:17.945 --> 11:20.714
Ah. So. Oh.
Oh, look, there's Trey,
and he's calling me. Trey!

11:20.814 --> 11:21.849
Trey!

11:22.649 --> 11:24.517
What's up, man?

11:24.617 --> 11:26.386
Man, my fridge is out,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.756
and I've got prawns
in my trunk going bad.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.524
Anybody want prawns?
Okay. You know what?

11:31.624 --> 11:33.526
I've got lasagna in my fridge
that's gonna spoil.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.028
I'm gonna bring it over.
That's good.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.931
Okay, well, you've got prawns,
I got ten pounds of fish.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.433
I'm gonna bring
that deep fryer out here.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.404
Hey, Dave,
bring out an extension cord!

11:44.504 --> 11:45.739
Hey, babe, look what I found

11:45.839 --> 11:47.274
when I was looking
for flashlights.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.509
Radio Raheem would be proud.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.246
(rhythmic, percussive intro
to upbeat funk song plays)

11:53.346 --> 11:55.682
I mean, look, we're all stuck
out here in this mess.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.018
We might as well
have a good time, right?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.386
Now watch me work.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.455
(upbeat funk song,
featuring brass plays)

12:07.260 --> 12:09.362
Is this veggie lasagna?
Turkey.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.831
Do you have veggie lasagna?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.699
Oh, no. It's just
what was in our fridge.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.035
You don't have
any vegetarian options?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.670
We are not a restaurant!

12:20.140 --> 12:23.210
Hey, uh, Gemma, I am so glad

12:23.310 --> 12:25.846
that none of these people know
that Dave caused that blackout.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.514
He did?

12:28.481 --> 12:29.482
Who's Dave?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.251
You are not Gemma.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.021
Hey, did you guys know
some Dave guy caused all this?

12:34.822 --> 12:37.624
Dude, you got a problem.
But...

12:38.491 --> 12:41.862
(speaking Vietnamese)

12:41.962 --> 12:45.432
Ooh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't speak, um... that.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.667
Sorry. My grandmother--

12:47.767 --> 12:50.037
she's offering you
her homemade Vietnamese soup.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.205
Oh. Oh. Okay, yeah.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.207
You know what? I-I believe
I've heard of this.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.444
This is, uh... this is
"foe," right? Yeah? "Foe."

12:57.544 --> 13:00.447
"Fuh." It's... "fuh."
"Fuh."

13:00.547 --> 13:02.682
"Fuh."

13:02.782 --> 13:06.186
Well, it's fuh... lavorful
is what it is.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.555
(laughs)
What's in this?

13:08.655 --> 13:11.124
(speaking Vietnamese)

13:11.224 --> 13:12.559
Mm.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.727
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.
Uh, hey, y'all.

13:14.828 --> 13:18.031
Anybody hungry? Get some
of this nice lady's soup.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.734
Hey, Dave?

13:21.835 --> 13:23.670
Would you happen to have
any USB-C connectors?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.205
All of these are A.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.706
Oh, yeah. Sure, Melvin.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.675
Let me just stop everything
I'm doing right now

13:28.775 --> 13:30.643
and go buy some for you.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.380
You're pretty sarcastic for
a guy who caused a blackout.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.148
Huh. I wonder who told you that.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.816
Malcolm!

13:41.321 --> 13:42.522
CALVIN:
Hey, man.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.491
Y'all got to taste this soup.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.060
It's spelled like "pho,"
but pronounced "fuh."

13:47.160 --> 13:50.630
It's a little confusing, but
once you get past the phonetics,

13:50.730 --> 13:52.699
it's delicious.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.768
And don't get me started
on the toppings. (laughs)

13:55.869 --> 13:58.205
Mmm. What up, fellas?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.507
I can't call it. (laughs)

14:02.009 --> 14:04.777
Dad, are you actually
enjoying yourself?

14:04.878 --> 14:06.813
What? No!

14:06.914 --> 14:09.282
No, I am furious
about this blackout.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.084
Plus, I'm missing my fight.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.986
But I ain't mad
at this "fuh," though.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.157
Grover used to be so sweet.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.692
Is this what having a teenager
is going to be like?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.728
Am I losing my little boy?

14:21.828 --> 14:23.964
Well, I hate to tell you, Gemma.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.166
Once your little boy
falls in love,

14:26.266 --> 14:28.701
you're gonna wish
you had scooter problems.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.972
Oh, God, I don't even
want to think that far.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.975
But you were so happy
when Marty got engaged.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.178
I still am, and...
and Necie-- she's very lovely.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.113
And those two are so good
for each other.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.849
But Marty's forgetting
the order of things.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.954
God, mother, wife.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.322
Same order for Calvin?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.523
Don't start with me, Gemma.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.959
(laughs)
MELVIN:
Whoa!

14:52.059 --> 14:54.194
He's down! He's down!
(shouting over phone)

14:54.995 --> 14:57.164
Y'all got the fight on this?
Yeah.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.067
Oh, look at that! He's getting
up! He's getting up!

15:00.167 --> 15:02.369
(phone ringing)
Oh, damn it, man.
Your mother's calling.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.371
I got to take this.
Yeah.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.439
H-Hey, Dave?

15:06.539 --> 15:07.874
We got to bring
your TV out here.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.842
It's mounted on the wall.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.479
Uh, who all wants to watch
the fight on a big screen?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.247
(people assenting and cheering)

15:14.347 --> 15:17.817
Big screen! Big screen!
Big screen! Big screen!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.619
The people have spoken.
(chanting continues)

15:19.719 --> 15:21.121
Come on.
Let's get that TV.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.324
(cheering)

15:24.424 --> 15:26.326
Oh! Yes!

15:26.426 --> 15:28.061
You see that, Tuyen?

15:28.161 --> 15:31.231
Ortiz just got a long reach.
You can't touch him!

15:31.331 --> 15:33.700
(speaking Vietnamese)

15:33.800 --> 15:36.103
Ah. You feel me.
I got you. (laughs)

15:36.203 --> 15:39.672
Hey. Hey, so, uh,
want some fried fish?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.375
CÃ¡ chiÃªn, Calvin. CÃ¡ chiÃªn.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.876
Oh, cÃ¡ chiÃªn. CÃ¡ chiÃªn, yes.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.079
My wife makes the best cÃ¡ chiÃªn.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.748
Oh. Okay.
Ah.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.451
I see this neighborhood
rubbing off on you.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.853
(all exclaiming)

15:53.953 --> 15:56.656
That was delicious
as always, Mama.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.458
Oh, thank you, baby.
Where's your brother?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.561
Oh, I saw him on the side yard
eating a plate of fish.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.631
Wait a minute. My fish?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.233
Yeah. (laughs)

16:06.333 --> 16:07.900
Got 'em!

16:08.735 --> 16:11.138
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, Mama, Mama.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.940
Please don't tell Marty
that I told you, okay?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.908
(sighs)
Don't you worry, baby.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.378
Oh, thank you. (chuckles)
I ain't no snitch.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.319
Aha!

16:26.419 --> 16:27.754
Oh, Mommy!

16:30.723 --> 16:32.592
This warms my heart.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.562
Mama, I tried. I tried
to be strong for Necie,

16:35.662 --> 16:37.830
but your fish kept calling me.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.900
I lied to the woman I love.
I am so ashamed.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.071
Oh, no, no, don't be,
sweetie. Don't be.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.974
Look, let me tell you
a secret about marriage.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.878
The occasional little
innocent lie never hurts.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.680
Really?
Sure.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.682
Like, your father
always lies and says

16:55.782 --> 16:57.850
that he doesn't
smoke cigars anymore,

16:57.950 --> 16:59.852
and I lie and say,

16:59.952 --> 17:04.257
"You've seen this dress
before." See?

17:04.357 --> 17:07.927
Okay, so, as far as anyone
knows, I didn't eat this fish?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.529
Marty, I'm your mother.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.264
I've always got your back.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.400
I didn't see you eat any fish.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.834
Hmm.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.007
Ah, what do you think
you're doing?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.875
It's just going
to go to waste!

17:22.975 --> 17:24.877
Listen, you may be
almost a teenager,

17:24.977 --> 17:27.447
but there are still consequences
for breaking my rules.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.549
There will be no video games,

17:29.649 --> 17:31.918
you are cleaning all of this up,

17:32.018 --> 17:35.021
and you are certainly
not getting ice cream.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.557
(sighs)
Sorry, Mom. I just...

17:37.657 --> 17:40.160
Austin thought it would be
cool to ride scooters,

17:40.260 --> 17:42.595
and I didn't want to be uncool.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.098
I didn't know what to do.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.568
It's okay, honey. I understand.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.137
Peer pressure can be hard,

17:50.237 --> 17:52.572
but it's only going
to get harder.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.342
But I know you're a good kid.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.478
Maybe next weekend we can go
see the Annie movie?

17:59.979 --> 18:02.215
(clicks tongue)
Do you want your ice cream back?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.651
Yes.
Well, you're not
getting it, liar.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.320
I am never going
to see that movie!

18:07.420 --> 18:12.091
Oh, yes, you are, and we are
gonna wear matching outfits!

18:16.463 --> 18:18.198
I don't understand
what's taking so long.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.400
Hey, Malcolm,
have you seen Thad?

18:22.402 --> 18:24.003
Nice try, Dave.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.440
You are not
getting me again.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.509
(fight bell clangs on TV)

18:29.609 --> 18:31.778
MAN (over TV):
It's the 12th round,
and these guys are toe to toe.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.147
I can't believe this.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.015
We're stuck waiting for power,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.685
and this guy is sitting there
watching my TV.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.620
Thad!

18:40.720 --> 18:43.456
These juice-hungry hordes
are sucking my power dry!

18:43.556 --> 18:46.092
Now, I need you
to get up there...
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

18:46.193 --> 18:49.229
Chill out, man. I told him
he can take a breather.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.064
Calvin, it has been hours,
and we still have no power.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.867
I know, but look around, man.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.869
I mean, the spirit
that I'm feeling here--

18:56.969 --> 18:58.104
I haven't felt that

18:58.205 --> 19:00.273
in this neighborhood
in a long time.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.910
I mean, people are actually
enjoying each other's company.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.979
And... and Tuyen--
she invited me

19:07.079 --> 19:08.948
to her mah-jongg club.

19:10.917 --> 19:14.086
I mean,
it's like spades, but Asian.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.924
So, if this is what
getting off the grid gets you,

19:18.024 --> 19:20.793
then, I'm not
in a hurry to get back on.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.795
It is kind of nice

19:22.895 --> 19:24.431
seeing everybody out
like this, isn't it?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.165
Yeah, man.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.235
So why don't you just
sit back and relax?

19:28.335 --> 19:32.038
Have you some pho, man.
Get some pho.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.475
I'm down to pho.

19:35.575 --> 19:39.679
This is an excellent party,
Calvin.

19:39.779 --> 19:40.947
Well, it is, isn't it?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.782
I'm sorry about this morning.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.685
I'm Sherri, this is Andrea, and
we just moved in on Cresthaven.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.320
Oh, uh, nice to meet you.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.357
And we're still looking for
recommendations of a landscaper.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.693
All right, well, uh,
I'll see what I can do.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.395
Welcome to the neighborhood.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.764
Good morning!

19:57.864 --> 19:59.466
It is 9:30.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.301
Do you not see the moon?

20:11.077 --> 20:12.379
You know, that was fun.
Mm.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.781
Who would have thought
it would take a power outage

20:14.881 --> 20:16.616
to restore my faith
in this neighborhood?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.218
Hmm. Yeah, it was
a great night.

20:19.319 --> 20:23.323
You know, with the candlelight
and you next to me,

20:23.423 --> 20:25.592
it could become
an even better night.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.594
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.829
So, are you trying
to do a little something?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.298
You know I am.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.899
WOMAN (on TV):
Side effects include itching,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.701
diarrhea,
constipation, dry mouth,

20:34.801 --> 20:36.369
significant increase
in mucus production...

20:36.469 --> 20:39.706
Okay, now the power's back on.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.342
So you gonna go
turn everything off

20:42.442 --> 20:44.611
so I can turn you on?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.313
Uh, change of plans, babe.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.114
That fight was $99.99.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.182
I'm about to go
watch the highlights.
Oh.
