00:51.791 --> 00:53.250
Faster, didi.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.375
It's so much fun.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.000
Faster!

01:02.625 --> 01:04.125
Yay!

01:04.208 --> 01:06.458
Faster, didi.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.000
Faster!

02:31.375 --> 02:32.583
Please have a look.

02:32.666 --> 02:33.708
What can you offer for this?

02:33.791 --> 02:35.083
Fifty rupees.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.166
That's too low.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.916
This quality doesn't sell here.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.208
At least have a look at the goods.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.375
Can’t offer you more.

02:41.458 --> 02:42.375
Please leave.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.708
You're still missing school?

03:31.583 --> 03:32.416
Well, sir…

03:33.000 --> 03:35.125
She was busy at home.
I'll send her tomorrow.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.500
-Sure?
-Yes, sir.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.958
Okay, see you tomorrow.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.166
Didi?

04:20.083 --> 04:20.958
What are you doing?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.708
I can go to school tomorrow,

04:26.125 --> 04:27.958
but I've outgrown my uniform.

04:48.541 --> 04:49.708
Didi, take this.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.708
What's this?

04:52.791 --> 04:54.125
I got you a uniform.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.125
Where did you get this from?

04:59.208 --> 05:01.208
And it's white!

05:02.958 --> 05:04.875
At least you have a uniform now.

05:19.791 --> 05:20.708
Sit down.

05:23.416 --> 05:24.375
All right, kids,

05:24.458 --> 05:27.041
today we’ll study chapter three

05:27.125 --> 05:29.041
and learn about water resources.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.458
I'll be talking
about the key water problems.

05:34.541 --> 05:35.541
Listen carefully.

05:35.625 --> 05:36.541
Where's your book?

05:36.625 --> 05:38.708
First is the scarcity of water.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.833
Exploitation of groundwater.

05:43.666 --> 05:46.166
Inability to use surface water.

05:46.833 --> 05:49.125
Overuse of agricultural land.

05:51.916 --> 05:52.750
You there!

05:55.416 --> 05:56.291
Stand up.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.541
Where's your textbook?

06:02.333 --> 06:03.166
I forgot.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.583
You've finally come to school,

06:07.416 --> 06:09.250
and you forgot your textbook?

06:10.750 --> 06:12.708
And what's up with your uniform?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.083
Go.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.541
Clean the corridors.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.208
Move!

06:25.833 --> 06:28.291
Sir, I need a token for the computer room.

06:31.000 --> 06:31.875
Go.

06:51.541 --> 06:52.458
What did you do?

06:59.958 --> 07:01.375
I forgot my textbook.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.583
Going to Khempur.

07:23.666 --> 07:26.458
Come on, everyone. Khempur!

07:26.541 --> 07:30.333
All aboard. Going to Khempur.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.083
Khempur!

07:32.166 --> 07:33.958
All aboard. Going to Khempur.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.166
Going to Khempur.

08:10.916 --> 08:15.250
KHEMPUR
6 KM

08:22.833 --> 08:25.208
Time to get off.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.166
Get down.

08:28.750 --> 08:29.583
Here?

08:30.208 --> 08:31.208
What?

08:31.583 --> 08:32.541
No…

08:32.916 --> 08:34.166
I need to go here.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.333
To Vikram Ji’s… It’s a hotel.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.833
Vikram?

09:23.791 --> 09:24.666
Please come.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.000
This is your room.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.833
Ever since I've listed online,

09:29.916 --> 09:31.416
I’ve got an incredible response.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.125
I get bookings from around the world.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.250
Just like you've come from London.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.750
How many nights is your booking for?

09:41.083 --> 09:42.750
You will have no complaints.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.958
But give us a good review when you leave.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.416
Ma’am, the view here is our speciality.

09:49.958 --> 09:52.416
People come from all over
just for this view.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.250
It’s a beautiful sight.

09:55.583 --> 09:56.666
Get some rest.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.875
This month's repayments are due.

10:06.958 --> 10:08.583
Okay. Give me lentils.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.250
I was thinking…

10:20.833 --> 10:21.750
I mean…

10:22.125 --> 10:23.458
Rupa was saying that

10:24.000 --> 10:27.125
she's filled the local form
to start stitching.

10:28.416 --> 10:30.541
If you don't have any objection,

10:30.625 --> 10:32.291
-I--
-Do you think I'm incapable?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.083
Working in the brick kiln isn't that bad.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.250
You working in the fields is enough.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.708
But it's not enough

10:43.666 --> 10:44.791
to run the house.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.833
We’ll be in further debt.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.625
Maybe I could help as well.

10:50.708 --> 10:51.541
Oh, really?

10:53.708 --> 10:55.125
So will you both run the house?

10:58.750 --> 11:01.291
You can barely sell peanuts,
and you want to help?

11:01.375 --> 11:04.250
-And that's why I want to--
-I, what?

11:04.333 --> 11:06.833
Do you know what people will say

11:06.916 --> 11:08.416
if you work outside in a factory?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.500
That I'm incapable to run my house,
and I'm making my wife work.

11:12.708 --> 11:13.666
No, but I mean…

11:14.166 --> 11:15.541
times are changing.

11:17.541 --> 11:18.625
What an expert!

11:31.166 --> 11:32.000
More rice?

11:51.208 --> 11:52.416
20 RUPEES

11:56.500 --> 11:58.166
One bottled water, please.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.000
-How much?
-Twenty rupees.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.666
Want the textbook too?

12:15.916 --> 12:17.666
No, I'll buy it later.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.083
Okay.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.916
Is there anything to see around?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.041
Yes. The village.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.625
Ankush!

12:58.708 --> 13:00.916
What are you doing?
Ankush, come here!

13:01.625 --> 13:02.500
Ankush!

13:02.583 --> 13:03.666
Ankush!

13:03.750 --> 13:05.333
Leave him, Ankush!

13:05.500 --> 13:06.708
Ankush!

13:06.791 --> 13:08.291
What are you doing, Ankush?

13:08.375 --> 13:09.583
Let him go!

13:09.666 --> 13:10.541
No, Ankush!

13:11.708 --> 13:13.291
What’s this nonsense, Ankush?

13:14.166 --> 13:15.666
Are you out of your mind?

13:15.750 --> 13:18.000
He started it by calling me
a toilet cleaner.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.000
That's true.

13:19.083 --> 13:22.625
He got toilet-duty in school today,
but he ran away.

13:22.708 --> 13:23.875
You're no elite.

13:23.958 --> 13:25.541
You are a toilet cleaner too.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.916
Everyone knows you failed twice in school.

13:29.791 --> 13:32.000
-Should I tell her what you did?
-Let’s go, didi.

13:32.083 --> 13:32.916
Should I tell her?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.541
Didi, he's known for cooking up stories.

13:34.625 --> 13:35.916
Look at that toilet cleaner running away.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.125
See that filthy rat run.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.750
Look at that toilet cleaner.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.333
-Run, Tipu!
-Didi!

13:53.416 --> 13:54.375
Ankush!

13:54.458 --> 13:55.500
Wait, Ankush!

13:56.000 --> 13:57.458
-Didi!
-Tipu, run.

13:57.541 --> 13:58.958
Didi, sorry.

14:00.916 --> 14:01.875
Sorry, didi.

14:01.958 --> 14:02.916
Didi.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.041
Didi, no.

14:04.541 --> 14:07.125
This one isn't for us. Come with me.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.083
That's for the upper caste.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.458
We can use this one.

14:33.000 --> 14:33.833
Sorry, didi.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.500
What's your name?

14:39.458 --> 14:40.541
Jessica.

14:41.791 --> 14:42.875
And yours?

14:43.500 --> 14:44.458
Prerna.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.000
Where are you from?

14:56.958 --> 14:57.958
London.

14:58.041 --> 14:58.916
London?

14:59.458 --> 15:00.291
Yes.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.708
But my dad was from India.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.875
What are you doing here?

15:11.666 --> 15:12.708
Are you married?

15:14.666 --> 15:15.500
Nope.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.000
How old are you?

15:21.291 --> 15:23.000
And you're still not married?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.666
My friend has
a one-year-old daughter already.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.458
How old are you?

15:35.041 --> 15:36.833
Okay, what grade are you in?

15:38.708 --> 15:39.541
Tell me.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.666
I don't go to school anymore.

15:42.458 --> 15:43.291
Why not?

15:46.958 --> 15:48.750
I don't have a school uniform.

15:49.791 --> 15:50.791
That’s it?

15:50.875 --> 15:52.666
Because of a school uniform?

15:57.166 --> 15:58.541
So what do you do then?

15:59.875 --> 16:03.083
Housework, work in the fields
and in the market.

16:03.166 --> 16:05.458
But it's important to go to school.

16:05.541 --> 16:08.125
If you don't go to school,
what will you do in the future?

16:18.416 --> 16:21.000
Look at my hair and my shirt.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.291
-You can speak in Hindi?
-Yes.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.000
What's this?

16:26.083 --> 16:27.666
His bearing car.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.291
Come, take a look.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.833
This is my bearing car.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.333
-Did you make it?
-Yes.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.666
You don't know what’s a skateboard?

16:43.375 --> 16:44.750
Okay, give me a minute.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.291
Try it, come on.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.375
Oh, no.

16:51.458 --> 16:52.625
Come on.

16:52.708 --> 16:54.250
Try it, it will be fun.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.458
Come.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.333
Now, you do it.

17:03.416 --> 17:04.583
See, it was fun, right?

17:06.208 --> 17:07.541
Slow down.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.666
Listen, where does one get new uniforms?

17:56.833 --> 17:59.041
I thought she'd yell or even hit me.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.166
But she didn't.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.833
She was very polite.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.541
And then,

18:05.500 --> 18:06.625
I don't know why,

18:07.375 --> 18:08.666
she spoke about herself.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.250
Asked me what I do.

18:11.708 --> 18:12.791
She’s very sweet.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.208
She's a foreigner,
but speaks Hindi really well.

18:17.166 --> 18:19.333
She also sprays perfume on her hands.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.708
But what is she doing here?

18:24.416 --> 18:25.583
I don't know.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.666
She doesn't know either.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.083
-Where is she from?
-London.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.375
London?

18:33.708 --> 18:34.958
Where's this village?

18:41.708 --> 18:42.625
It's brand new.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.333
And she didn't want anything in return?

18:48.791 --> 18:50.500
There's got to be a reason.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.375
You're so silly…

18:54.375 --> 18:56.583
taking things from strangers.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.958
Don't let your father see this.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.041
Go now.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.166
Prerna.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.166
The textbook.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.625
What are you studying?

19:49.708 --> 19:50.583
The map.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.500
Ankush.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.000
Where did you get him from?

20:32.250 --> 20:33.500
He is…

20:35.541 --> 20:36.375
Gillu.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.083
You goat thief!

20:38.166 --> 20:39.458
Did you steal a goat?

20:39.916 --> 20:41.583
Look, Ma, she stole a goat.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.666
Ma, he was trapped over there.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.541
I just saved his life.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.458
That's good.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.541
Now leave him here.
It belongs to someone else.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.166
He's a stray.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.583
Can’t we take him home?

20:54.666 --> 20:55.500
No way!

21:05.708 --> 21:07.791
Do you know what I prayed for
in the temple?

21:08.833 --> 21:09.916
What?

21:16.875 --> 21:17.875
See this.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.125
Cool shoes, right?

21:20.208 --> 21:21.416
Keep dreaming.

21:22.458 --> 21:23.875
What did you pray for?

21:25.625 --> 21:29.166
Never mind, God can't hear you
from outside the temple.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.125
Why didn't you come inside?

21:35.916 --> 21:36.833
Stomach cramps.

21:37.916 --> 21:38.750
Again?

21:40.583 --> 21:41.625
Shut up, Ankush.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.375
My bearing car looks awesome, isn't it?

21:53.458 --> 21:54.750
Yes!

21:59.875 --> 22:01.208
How do I get it out?

22:01.750 --> 22:03.458
-You want it?
-Yes.

22:03.541 --> 22:05.250
Okay, give it to me.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.833
I'll draw it for you.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.291
Didi, draw my tractor too.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.291
-I have a DJ car!
-My rolling cart!

22:14.375 --> 22:15.750
I have a water tanker.

22:36.416 --> 22:38.000
It's lovely, isn’t it?

22:43.958 --> 22:44.875
He won’t come.

22:45.375 --> 22:46.500
Why?

22:46.625 --> 22:48.041
He's from the upper caste.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.500
What are you doing here?

22:49.583 --> 22:51.666
How many times have I told you
to not play with these kids?

22:51.750 --> 22:52.625
Let's go home.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.083
Here you go, I got it out.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.416
Bearing car!

23:30.666 --> 23:31.791
My bearing car!

23:39.791 --> 23:42.333
Ma'am, he was asking
about you in the entire village,

23:42.416 --> 23:44.333
so I brought him here directly. Who is he?

23:52.916 --> 23:55.750
Didi, his bearing car is so nice.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.708
This is a skateboard.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.833
Hello, brother, wash-your-name?

24:01.916 --> 24:03.833
Hey, first wash your face!

24:07.625 --> 24:08.458
And your names?

24:19.916 --> 24:22.708
-Bhaiya, I am Tipu.
-I am Rahul.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.375
Hey, Tipya, leave him alone.

24:26.125 --> 24:27.083
Don’t disturb bhaiya.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.541
Bhaiya! Please skate for us…

24:30.625 --> 24:32.708
Please, bhaiya. Show us. Just once!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.750
-That's awesome!
-He's fast!

25:02.833 --> 25:04.458
Look, he was in mid-air.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.333
They are so good.

25:10.916 --> 25:12.083
Do you want to try it?

25:13.250 --> 25:14.166
No.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.750
I won't be able to do it.

25:15.833 --> 25:18.208
Just try and step on the board once.

25:18.708 --> 25:20.666
No, didi, I'll fall.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.958
Didi, you won't.

25:23.666 --> 25:25.125
Try it, it will be fun.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.708
Didi, try it, you’ll enjoy.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.875
I told you, I won't be able to do it.

26:06.791 --> 26:08.458
That's what your name means, right?

26:46.416 --> 26:48.541
I told you my didi could do it.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.416
Now show them how to do it.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.875
-I'll also try it.
-And me too!

27:16.500 --> 27:18.916
Bhaiya, will I get to skate again?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.750
Bhaiya, will you come tomorrow?

27:20.833 --> 27:21.958
-Please, bhaiya…
-Please.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.083
Hey! What? Quiet!

27:23.166 --> 27:25.208
-Bhaiya, please.
-Bhaiya, please.

27:37.416 --> 27:40.416
Bhaiya, I want to skate again.

27:44.666 --> 27:47.041
Bhaiya, please stay back.

28:34.416 --> 28:35.500
Get me my book.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.375
What do you want?

28:40.583 --> 28:41.416
Prerna.

28:42.416 --> 28:43.875
Do you want to use the computer?

28:54.916 --> 28:57.625
Do you know how to go online?

28:58.208 --> 28:59.833
Yes, wait I'll show you.

29:00.625 --> 29:02.250
I want to see skating videos.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.416
Can I keep it for now?

30:36.750 --> 30:37.916
Where did this come from?

30:41.125 --> 30:44.416
Someone gave it to Ankush for a day.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.916
Will return it tomorrow.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.291
Why are you playing with things
meant for boys?

30:49.958 --> 30:51.291
Go, cook some lentils.

30:58.833 --> 30:59.791
What's going on?

31:02.250 --> 31:03.500
Get back to class.

31:03.583 --> 31:04.416
Go.

31:08.583 --> 31:09.500
Sorry, Papa.

31:11.916 --> 31:13.958
Don't lower your standards.

31:14.041 --> 31:14.958
Got it?

31:15.041 --> 31:16.000
Yes, Papa.

31:16.750 --> 31:17.583
Go on.

31:19.958 --> 31:21.458
Ankush…

31:21.541 --> 31:22.458
Look.

31:23.458 --> 31:24.916
I’m flying!

31:27.750 --> 31:28.958
Didi, careful!

31:33.833 --> 31:34.958
The board's gone.

31:44.583 --> 31:45.583
Didi!

31:47.791 --> 31:48.625
Didi!

31:52.125 --> 31:53.666
Who asked you to dive in?

31:54.583 --> 31:56.291
You’ve ruined Erick Bhaiya's board.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.916
How will we explain this at home?

32:01.083 --> 32:02.250
Had fun skating?

32:06.416 --> 32:07.250
Come, Gillu.

32:14.958 --> 32:16.666
What did I tell you earlier?

32:18.250 --> 32:20.791
You took something from a stranger again?

32:25.541 --> 32:26.625
Go, hide it now.

32:26.708 --> 32:27.541
And listen,

32:27.625 --> 32:29.791
you better return it first thing tomorrow.

32:30.916 --> 32:31.833
Go quickly.

32:35.208 --> 32:37.625
Kamlesh has put me
on double shifts starting tomorrow.

32:39.916 --> 32:40.958
-Water?
-No.

33:07.625 --> 33:08.458
Get down.

33:12.416 --> 33:13.291
What happened?

33:15.458 --> 33:16.291
What?

33:17.041 --> 33:18.625
How much does a skateboard cost?

33:19.875 --> 33:21.916
She's ruined Erick Bhaiya's skateboard.

33:22.416 --> 33:23.541
It's destroyed.

33:24.708 --> 33:25.666
Sorry, bhaiya.

33:38.916 --> 33:39.833
Sorry, bhaiya.

33:44.583 --> 33:45.625
Bhaiya.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.416
Please bhaiya.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.083
Come on, now go to school.

34:18.833 --> 34:20.541
Stealing in your own house?

34:24.125 --> 34:25.958
Is this what we’ve taught you?

34:27.083 --> 34:30.125
No, Papa. I was putting it back.

34:30.791 --> 34:32.166
So, you did steal before?

34:36.333 --> 34:37.833
I’m asking you something.

34:39.375 --> 34:40.833
I made a mistake, Papa.

34:53.416 --> 34:54.250
Didi.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.666
Why did you put the money back?

34:58.708 --> 35:01.208
We could’ve bought chocolates with it.

35:01.291 --> 35:02.958
We could’ve had so much fun.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.166
-Hi, didi.
-Hi, didi.

35:42.583 --> 35:43.666
Yes!

35:45.916 --> 35:48.125
This is a real bearing car, right?

35:56.083 --> 35:56.916
Subodh.

36:04.875 --> 36:05.750
No.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.541
-For me?
-Yes.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.208
Didi.

36:34.416 --> 36:37.333
Do you think she will
get us new shoes too?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.250
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

40:41.375 --> 40:42.416
Hey, get out!

40:46.416 --> 40:48.041
Wow, didi, you're doing it so well.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.875
Where is everyone else?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.291
They've disrupted everything!

42:00.375 --> 42:04.166
Sir, we need your support
to get rid of this problem.

42:04.250 --> 42:05.625
-Very true.
-He's right.

42:05.708 --> 42:07.791
-Please take action.
-Or I'll be out of business.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.000
It was fun skipping school today.

42:47.041 --> 42:50.083
FINE FOR SKATEBOARDING - RS. 500

42:51.500 --> 42:52.958
Five hundred rupees fine.

42:53.041 --> 42:58.625
BEWARE OF DOGS AND DON'T SKATE HERE.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.250
Stop!

43:02.333 --> 43:03.541
What are you doing?

43:03.625 --> 43:05.041
Read that board.

43:07.875 --> 43:10.041
SKATEBOARDING NOT ALLOWED.

43:10.125 --> 43:14.166
Today we'll study about the Father
of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi…

43:15.208 --> 43:18.708
who led India’s struggle
for independence with non-violence.

43:20.416 --> 43:22.416
Gandhi’s Dandi March,

43:22.500 --> 43:23.833
Quit India Movement,

43:23.916 --> 43:28.333
and Salt Tax Revolution
caused an outbreak in the nation.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.500
Skating is not a crime.

43:34.583 --> 43:36.416
Not a crime, not a crime.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.250
We kids want to shine.

43:38.333 --> 43:40.125
Want to shine, want to shine.

43:40.208 --> 43:42.000
Fulfill our wishes now!

43:42.083 --> 43:43.916
Fulfill them now, fulfill them now.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.875
Skating is not a crime.

43:45.958 --> 43:47.708
Not a crime, not a crime.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.500
We kids want to shine.

43:49.583 --> 43:51.375
Want to shine, want to shine.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.208
Fulfill our wishes now!

43:53.291 --> 43:55.000
Fulfill them now, fulfill them now.

43:55.083 --> 43:56.916
Skating is not a crime.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.708
Look! It’s the teacher, run!

44:11.583 --> 44:13.083
Now it’s an everyday nuisance.

44:13.166 --> 44:17.083
Excuse me, you can’t confiscate
their boards like this.

44:17.166 --> 44:19.250
Madam, there’s a complaint against you.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.083
What is their crime?

44:22.083 --> 44:25.333
There were only two students
in my class today, thanks to you!

44:27.375 --> 44:30.166
The regular ones are skipping school, too,

44:30.708 --> 44:32.250
because of this nuisance.

44:33.166 --> 44:35.083
And these brats are influencing
my son as well!

44:40.208 --> 44:41.708
Do you have a permit?

44:43.625 --> 44:45.000
This is India!

44:45.916 --> 44:47.875
Things work differently here.

44:47.958 --> 44:49.125
Show me your Aadhaar card.

44:50.833 --> 44:52.166
It’s mandatory to have one.

44:53.416 --> 44:55.041
Then show me your passport.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.750
This is the root cause of the problem.

44:57.833 --> 44:58.750
Just hear me out, please--

44:58.833 --> 45:00.250
Listen to me, madam.

45:00.541 --> 45:02.291
You’re still an Indian, aren’t you?

45:02.375 --> 45:03.375
Yes, do you doubt it?

45:03.458 --> 45:05.375
Then why are you bringing
these Western things here?

45:15.375 --> 45:18.083
They start skating anywhere,
from shops and alleys

45:18.166 --> 45:21.666
to places where they aren't
even allowed to enter.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.791
They've created chaos
in the whole village.

45:23.875 --> 45:26.125
Look, madam, we have a system here.

45:26.916 --> 45:27.875
There are rules.

45:27.958 --> 45:31.083
They’re ruining public property.

45:31.833 --> 45:33.583
It's not a garden or a park.

45:34.208 --> 45:38.375
Vikram, she’s your guest and a lady,
so I’m letting her go.

45:38.458 --> 45:39.291
Yes.

45:39.375 --> 45:41.166
If I get one more complaint…

45:43.125 --> 45:44.666
Sir, I'll make sure
it doesn't happen again.

45:46.041 --> 45:46.916
You can go now.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.583
Singh Sahab, take it in writing,
or they’ll do it again.

45:55.208 --> 45:56.041
Listen…

45:56.666 --> 45:58.708
if any of you miss school tomorrow then--

48:05.541 --> 48:06.375
Didi.

48:09.583 --> 48:11.083
What are you doing here?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.041
This is the upper caste locality.

48:14.958 --> 48:16.916
Do people still follow the caste system?

48:18.875 --> 48:20.500
Nobody talks about it,

48:20.583 --> 48:21.958
but it's an unsaid norm.

48:25.291 --> 48:27.250
I am sorry that you can’t skate anymore.

48:35.125 --> 48:37.250
Skating is the best thing
that happened to me.

48:43.750 --> 48:45.041
How long are you here for?

48:46.208 --> 48:47.541
I leave tomorrow.

48:51.791 --> 48:53.000
But…

48:53.083 --> 48:55.166
there’s still so much to see here.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.291
-Here? In this village?
-Yes.

51:06.083 --> 51:06.916
Hey, bhai!

51:39.541 --> 51:42.000
-Tipya, no school.
-No!

51:42.083 --> 51:43.833
Ankush, no.

51:43.916 --> 51:45.875
This means if you don’t go to school,

51:45.958 --> 51:48.166
you won’t be allowed to skate.

51:48.250 --> 51:49.083
What?

51:49.166 --> 51:50.916
Yes. It’s a rule.

51:52.875 --> 51:55.208
They come up with new rules every day.

52:10.458 --> 52:11.291
Sit down.

52:25.208 --> 52:27.125
No one has ever thought
of something like this before.

52:36.791 --> 52:37.625
Alone?

52:48.458 --> 52:50.875
How can I sanction that kind of money?

52:52.041 --> 52:54.666
Our charity funds
have already been allotted for this year.

52:55.750 --> 52:57.750
Besides, you’re not from an official NGO.

52:57.833 --> 53:01.208
Try next year, after registration.

53:02.708 --> 53:04.708
And if you need any other help,
let me know.

53:14.125 --> 53:16.416
We can’t justify these funds.

53:17.541 --> 53:19.000
This game…

53:19.083 --> 53:20.208
I mean sport.

53:20.291 --> 53:21.291
It has no rules.

53:22.833 --> 53:25.541
How can I propose a sport
with no rules to the committee?

53:26.458 --> 53:28.833
The Sports Association
won't be able to help you.

53:28.916 --> 53:31.250
Why don’t you try for private
or personal funding?

54:06.625 --> 54:07.500
Namaste.

54:15.875 --> 54:20.708
Why do you want to build
this skatepark in that village?

54:21.500 --> 54:23.250
I was raised in London.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.833
I knew what I wanted to be
while I was still in school.

54:30.916 --> 54:33.416
"What do you want to do
when you grow up?"

54:34.208 --> 54:36.958
She had no answer.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.791
Because no one had ever
asked her that before.

55:50.916 --> 55:53.416
I was thinking about what you said.

55:54.583 --> 55:57.333
People resist change here,

55:58.083 --> 56:01.791
especially if that change
is led by a woman.

56:02.416 --> 56:06.333
There are unsaid rules for women here,

56:06.916 --> 56:08.666
some of which you’ve already broken.

56:12.166 --> 56:13.333
If…

56:13.416 --> 56:15.583
I deny you today,

56:15.666 --> 56:19.333
life will go on as is.

56:20.458 --> 56:22.083
But if I say yes,

56:22.166 --> 56:25.041
maybe we’ll see a better tomorrow?

56:26.000 --> 56:29.291
And it could give several girls

56:29.375 --> 56:34.750
the courage to follow their dreams.

56:37.375 --> 56:40.541
Someday I’ll tell you my story.

56:41.458 --> 56:43.291
But for now, start your work.

56:54.083 --> 56:55.791
No one can stop us now.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.958
Ma’am, I'll sort everything out.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.458
Tea, please.

59:59.291 --> 1:00:01.083
Whose call are you avoiding?

1:00:01.166 --> 1:00:02.000
Bhawani Ji's.

1:00:02.708 --> 1:00:06.875
He wants to get involved now
because the elections are nearing.

1:00:18.666 --> 1:00:19.916
Ankush.

1:00:21.208 --> 1:00:22.041
What's up?

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:28.958
Let’s go.

1:00:29.916 --> 1:00:31.500
Let's go, everyone. Hurry up.

1:00:31.583 --> 1:00:34.291
-Jessica Ma'am is calling us.
-Come on, fast.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:04.541
You all have three months to practice.

1:01:17.250 --> 1:01:20.166
Skaters from all over India
will participate in the contest.

1:01:20.250 --> 1:01:22.541
You will each get a 45-second run,

1:01:22.625 --> 1:01:26.083
and you've to showcase
as many tricks as you can.

1:01:26.166 --> 1:01:27.583
What do you mean by tricks?

1:01:27.666 --> 1:01:29.583
Just like an ollie,

1:01:29.666 --> 1:01:32.041
do as many tricks as you know.

1:01:32.125 --> 1:01:34.375
What if we fall? Are we done?

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:37.625
No, you get back on the board.

1:01:37.708 --> 1:01:41.625
A whistle will blow
after 45 seconds are over,

1:01:41.708 --> 1:01:43.250
which means your time is up.

1:01:43.750 --> 1:01:48.291
But remember, you also get points
to skate till the very end.

1:02:09.166 --> 1:02:10.958
Hey, move, move aside!

1:02:24.125 --> 1:02:25.500
No, you go ahead.

1:02:39.875 --> 1:02:41.916
I’ve touched the pinnacle

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.750
I’ve realized my worth

1:02:43.833 --> 1:02:47.250
Now that my feet have opened up as wings

1:02:49.958 --> 1:02:51.000
Yes.

1:02:51.333 --> 1:02:52.916
Why shouldn’t I weave

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.250
The dreams my eyes have seen?

1:02:57.333 --> 1:02:59.666
My complicated life

1:02:59.750 --> 1:03:01.208
I have to resolve

1:03:01.291 --> 1:03:03.291
The trust I have in me

1:03:03.375 --> 1:03:04.916
Has to manifest

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.416
I’ll touch the sky, immersed in joy

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:10.291
Like the wind

1:03:51.208 --> 1:03:52.333
Are you having fun, Kusum?

1:03:52.416 --> 1:03:54.500
I’ve taken flight

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:13.166
Following my heart

1:04:13.250 --> 1:04:15.041
In spite of the fear

1:04:15.125 --> 1:04:18.750
Riding on these wheels

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.125
Didi!

1:04:20.208 --> 1:04:22.208
The sky twirls when

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:26.166
They see I’ve leaped across these walls

1:05:06.666 --> 1:05:10.791
I’ve taken flight

1:05:35.333 --> 1:05:36.166
Ankush.

1:05:38.125 --> 1:05:38.958
Ankush.

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:42.083
Get up.

1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:11.958
How did you manage to drop-in
at the first attempt?

1:06:12.375 --> 1:06:14.208
Weren't you scared of falling?

1:06:14.833 --> 1:06:15.791
I was…

1:06:16.541 --> 1:06:17.750
but I did it anyway.

1:06:19.333 --> 1:06:22.833
We're working so hard
for this contest. Aren’t we?

1:06:47.708 --> 1:06:52.416
And now, presenting
the number one skater of this village,

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:54.958
Prerna Bhil.

1:06:55.041 --> 1:06:58.375
Today she's going to show us
the biggest drop-in!

1:07:06.875 --> 1:07:07.916
Didi, just do it.

1:07:27.875 --> 1:07:28.875
Didi!

1:07:30.916 --> 1:07:31.750
Didi.

1:07:32.458 --> 1:07:33.333
Are you okay?

1:07:51.166 --> 1:07:52.416
Ankush. Come on.

1:07:59.291 --> 1:08:00.375
I’ll be back soon.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.666
Tipya, wait for me.

1:08:11.250 --> 1:08:12.416
What did you break?

1:08:13.666 --> 1:08:14.916
What are you doing?

1:08:17.125 --> 1:08:18.208
Let me see it.

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.208
How did this happen?

1:08:22.166 --> 1:08:23.041
It's just a bruise.

1:08:23.625 --> 1:08:25.166
But how did this happen?

1:08:27.958 --> 1:08:29.958
I fell while skating.

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:43.916
You’ve created a nuisance in the village.

1:08:44.666 --> 1:08:46.708
Keep my daughter out of it.

1:08:49.166 --> 1:08:50.125
What happened?

1:08:50.791 --> 1:08:52.875
What have you been teaching Prerna?

1:08:53.250 --> 1:08:55.458
To lie and steal?

1:08:56.125 --> 1:08:58.375
To behave like a boy?

1:08:58.458 --> 1:09:00.250
She can't even do her housework anymore.

1:09:00.333 --> 1:09:01.541
She's at home with a swollen foot.

1:09:04.416 --> 1:09:06.958
She must have hurt herself while skating.

1:09:07.041 --> 1:09:08.750
I don't know.

1:09:08.833 --> 1:09:10.333
But is she okay?

1:09:10.416 --> 1:09:11.541
Okay?

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:13.791
She should be married by now,
but she's skating.

1:09:13.875 --> 1:09:15.250
What if something goes wrong?

1:09:15.333 --> 1:09:17.750
Who will marry her
if she breaks her bones?

1:09:25.458 --> 1:09:27.416
I can't have her follow in your footsteps.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.541
Living-in with a man before marriage--

1:09:33.291 --> 1:09:37.708
News travels fast in the village.

1:09:37.791 --> 1:09:40.041
This is not your city, it's a village.

1:09:43.541 --> 1:09:45.208
Stay away from my children!

1:09:49.125 --> 1:09:49.958
Come.

1:09:52.750 --> 1:09:53.583
Let's go.

1:10:45.083 --> 1:10:48.833
Sorry about what Papa said the other day.

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:55.875
How’s Prerna?

1:10:57.666 --> 1:10:58.583
She's better…

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.916
but she's grounded.

1:11:02.833 --> 1:11:04.916
She's not allowed to skate.

1:11:31.291 --> 1:11:34.125
Why do you like skating so much?

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:40.208
I don’t know…

1:11:42.625 --> 1:11:43.708
but it feels good.

1:11:47.458 --> 1:11:51.416
I feel like I belong…

1:11:52.458 --> 1:11:53.791
like it's something I can do.

1:12:03.666 --> 1:12:07.208
There’s no one to control me,
no rules to follow.

1:12:12.250 --> 1:12:15.666
It feels like I'm gliding in the sky.

1:12:26.291 --> 1:12:28.458
Prerna Didi is here.

1:12:31.750 --> 1:12:32.666
Come.

1:12:33.541 --> 1:12:35.666
Why didn't you come
for so many days? What happened?

1:12:36.666 --> 1:12:37.500
Come.

1:12:57.750 --> 1:12:59.583
As if destiny was upset with me

1:12:59.666 --> 1:13:01.625
As if my hopes were broken

1:13:01.708 --> 1:13:04.208
But now the whole sky is mine

1:13:09.250 --> 1:13:10.500
I can’t do it.

1:13:11.250 --> 1:13:12.166
And…

1:13:12.250 --> 1:13:13.500
what if I fall again?

1:13:14.458 --> 1:13:16.291
Let the tight fists open

1:13:16.375 --> 1:13:18.416
I’ll knock them all out

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:21.166
Now that the whole sky is mine

1:13:22.750 --> 1:13:24.791
A few desires that I have

1:13:24.875 --> 1:13:26.875
Should get fulfilled

1:13:26.958 --> 1:13:30.041
I’ve broken the shackles
Of envy, bondage and...

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:32.208
I've taken the leap

1:13:34.125 --> 1:13:37.041
Let's have a little fun

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:40.291
Now that I'm on my way

1:13:40.375 --> 1:13:44.500
To turn the wheels of my life

1:13:46.916 --> 1:13:48.916
I've taken the leap

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.458
You are my best friend.

1:13:52.041 --> 1:13:54.791
Do you know who else are my best friends?

1:13:58.250 --> 1:14:00.000
Jessica Didi and Subodh.

1:14:21.166 --> 1:14:26.041
I am faster than the wind

1:14:29.583 --> 1:14:31.416
I'm surprised myself

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:34.083
At the story of my life

1:14:37.333 --> 1:14:41.041
The bird has broken the cage
And taken flight

1:14:41.125 --> 1:14:45.291
From every worry and fear
She's turned away

1:14:45.375 --> 1:14:49.375
Flown away...

1:14:53.708 --> 1:14:55.916
I've taken the leap

1:14:57.583 --> 1:15:00.000
Let's have a little fun

1:15:01.583 --> 1:15:03.791
Now that I'm on my way

1:15:03.875 --> 1:15:09.250
To turn the wheels of my life

1:15:20.958 --> 1:15:24.583
I've taken the leap

1:15:39.833 --> 1:15:41.666
"Today is the last day of the carnival.

1:15:42.166 --> 1:15:45.291
If you come with me,

1:15:45.375 --> 1:15:48.291
I'll know you like me too."

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:20.458
The entire village knows
who you were with.

1:17:22.875 --> 1:17:24.958
They are upper caste Brahmins.

1:17:25.875 --> 1:17:27.541
We can't mingle with them.

1:17:32.958 --> 1:17:34.583
So this is what you've been hiding.

1:17:37.541 --> 1:17:39.000
You have got some nerve.

1:17:39.750 --> 1:17:41.250
Injuring your foot wasn't enough?

1:17:45.291 --> 1:17:47.666
Papa, my contest is next week.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:48.875
Shut up!

1:17:48.958 --> 1:17:50.708
-Please don't do this.
-Step back!

1:17:53.333 --> 1:17:54.958
If you can't make us proud,

1:17:55.041 --> 1:17:56.833
at least don't bring us shame.

1:18:16.291 --> 1:18:17.666
It's time to find her a groom.

1:18:17.750 --> 1:18:20.041
I can't handle her responsibility anymore.

1:18:45.291 --> 1:18:46.291
Where's Gillu?

1:18:53.041 --> 1:18:54.416
What did you do to him?

1:19:09.875 --> 1:19:11.500
Ankush will bring her back.

1:19:39.083 --> 1:19:40.166
Pretty, isn't it?

1:19:41.208 --> 1:19:42.625
-I'll take this one.
-Okay.

1:19:47.250 --> 1:19:48.083
Okay.

1:19:59.916 --> 1:20:00.958
It'll be ready in two days.

1:20:01.041 --> 1:20:01.916
Okay.

1:20:04.541 --> 1:20:05.500
Be happy.

1:20:07.958 --> 1:20:08.916
Let's go.

1:20:30.541 --> 1:20:34.791
Didi, if you don't like him,
don't marry him. Who cares?

1:20:35.541 --> 1:20:37.458
At least you’ve got a new dress.

1:20:41.750 --> 1:20:42.583
Ankush.

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:54.791
After you.

1:20:57.625 --> 1:20:59.375
Will everything be ready in one week?

1:20:59.458 --> 1:21:00.750
Yes, we'll manage.

1:21:00.916 --> 1:21:01.750
Tea?

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:06.208
So what all are you good at?

1:21:06.833 --> 1:21:07.666
Skating.

1:21:08.333 --> 1:21:10.041
-What?
-Setting!

1:21:10.125 --> 1:21:11.791
-She sets the house very well.
-Okay.

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:14.583
-She cleans really well.
-Okay.

1:21:14.666 --> 1:21:16.208
She even cooks very well.

1:21:16.833 --> 1:21:18.500
She can handle all the housework.

1:21:18.583 --> 1:21:20.958
She won't give you
a reason to complain.

1:21:21.041 --> 1:21:21.875
Okay.

1:21:39.583 --> 1:21:40.791
Girl looks good.

1:21:41.916 --> 1:21:42.875
Yes, let's talk.

1:21:45.708 --> 1:21:48.583
We like the girl,

1:21:48.666 --> 1:21:50.375
you take care of the rest.

1:21:50.750 --> 1:21:53.083
Will you really be ready in seven days?

1:21:53.166 --> 1:21:55.416
Everything will be ready, don't worry.

1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:58.125
I have spoken to my boss,
he'll help me out too.

1:21:59.666 --> 1:22:01.458
Why didn't you tell me before?

1:22:02.125 --> 1:22:03.750
I’ll speak to your father.

1:22:05.666 --> 1:22:06.500
No.

1:22:08.416 --> 1:22:10.416
Things will get complicated, didi.

1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:14.625
He sold everything to organize this.

1:22:28.625 --> 1:22:30.250
I only came to say goodbye.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.708
I'll move to another village
after the wedding.

1:23:27.208 --> 1:23:28.333
Prerna.

1:23:28.416 --> 1:23:29.916
What's all this?

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.541
Can't you see?

1:23:36.125 --> 1:23:39.000
There's nothing more important
to you than skating, right?

1:23:39.166 --> 1:23:41.083
It doesn't matter anymore.

1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:45.791
There’s still time for the championship.

1:23:45.875 --> 1:23:47.333
You can participate.

1:23:47.708 --> 1:23:49.625
I'm getting married that same day.

1:23:51.333 --> 1:23:52.625
Please leave, Subodh.

1:23:55.083 --> 1:23:57.583
If someone spots you here,
all hell will break loose.

1:24:14.541 --> 1:24:16.000
Here, take this.

1:24:19.166 --> 1:24:20.250
Hey! Narayan,

1:24:20.750 --> 1:24:22.041
what are you doing here?

1:24:23.333 --> 1:24:24.583
It's not for you to sit.

1:24:24.666 --> 1:24:26.416
Go, give this to Dal Ji.

1:24:27.208 --> 1:24:28.875
He's still at it.

1:24:28.958 --> 1:24:31.166
Bhaiya, please hurry.

1:24:31.250 --> 1:24:33.125
We've to send it there too.

1:24:34.333 --> 1:24:36.083
Chanda, take this.

1:24:36.833 --> 1:24:38.833
I'll bring another stack.

1:24:39.416 --> 1:24:41.166
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:24:41.250 --> 1:24:42.583
people of Khempur,

1:24:43.083 --> 1:24:45.583
we welcome you to our

1:24:45.666 --> 1:24:48.083
All India Skateboarding Championship!

1:24:55.041 --> 1:24:58.500
So with a huge round of applause,
let's welcome Bhawani Ji,

1:25:01.833 --> 1:25:04.541
along with our two judges,

1:25:05.416 --> 1:25:08.041
Mr. Darius and Mr. Emmanuel.

1:25:09.750 --> 1:25:10.583
Yes!

1:25:14.041 --> 1:25:16.500
Without further ado
let's kickstart this championship.

1:25:17.083 --> 1:25:21.791
Our first participant
is the pride of Khempur,

1:25:22.416 --> 1:25:23.666
our very own,

1:25:23.750 --> 1:25:24.583
Lila!

1:25:27.458 --> 1:25:29.666
Four boxes are right there.

1:25:31.333 --> 1:25:32.416
Give me your hand.

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:34.125
Ma…

1:25:34.666 --> 1:25:36.625
Ankush said he chews tobacco.

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:39.875
You will soon get used to it.

1:25:41.291 --> 1:25:43.083
Do you think he's good for me?

1:25:44.916 --> 1:25:47.541
I hadn't even seen your father
before our wedding.

1:25:48.375 --> 1:25:50.416
I was about your age when I got married.

1:25:51.708 --> 1:25:52.958
I was very weak…

1:25:53.875 --> 1:25:54.833
but you’re not.

1:25:56.208 --> 1:25:57.208
What do you mean?

1:26:00.291 --> 1:26:03.083
I bled a lot when you were born.

1:26:03.958 --> 1:26:07.416
The doctor said I had a weak uterus
and had to be careful.

1:26:09.250 --> 1:26:11.666
That's why you were premature by a month,

1:26:13.291 --> 1:26:16.666
but girls born in the eighth month
have a fighting spirit,

1:26:17.458 --> 1:26:19.166
that’s why you’re here today.

1:26:21.416 --> 1:26:23.416
Weren’t you weak when Ankush was born?

1:26:25.625 --> 1:26:26.666
I was…

1:26:27.541 --> 1:26:30.500
but a girl child isn't enough
to complete a family.

1:26:30.583 --> 1:26:32.041
Everyone wants a son.

1:26:34.875 --> 1:26:37.250
Besides, my choice never mattered.

1:26:41.958 --> 1:26:43.875
Everyone has their own destiny.

1:26:45.208 --> 1:26:46.791
No one can change that.

1:26:48.666 --> 1:26:50.875
What if skating is my destiny?

1:27:06.541 --> 1:27:07.833
You look beautiful.

1:27:14.541 --> 1:27:17.791
And Tipu is showcasing his unique trick.

1:27:17.875 --> 1:27:20.000
What a great job, Tipu. Well done!

1:27:20.083 --> 1:27:22.875
He is fearlessly moving ahead,

1:27:22.958 --> 1:27:25.375
but uh-oh!

1:27:25.458 --> 1:27:27.833
And that’s the end of Tipu’s 45 seconds.

1:27:29.458 --> 1:27:31.500
And now in the Juniors' category,

1:27:31.583 --> 1:27:33.208
from Bhil Basti, we have,

1:27:33.791 --> 1:27:34.916
Ankush!

1:27:35.958 --> 1:27:38.000
Let's hear it for him.

1:27:38.083 --> 1:27:41.458
Looks like he is going to start
with a trick on the ledge.

1:27:45.583 --> 1:27:46.958
Good job!

1:27:55.583 --> 1:27:57.583
There’s something about his style.

1:27:59.583 --> 1:28:02.541
Give him a round of applause.
Well done, Ankush!

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.500
What a fine job, Ankush. Fabulous!

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.791
And the next skater is from Delhi…

1:28:09.916 --> 1:28:11.333
Rahul, take this quickly.

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:12.958
Tipu, hurry up. Let's run.

1:28:13.041 --> 1:28:15.125
We're getting late for the wedding.

1:28:18.875 --> 1:28:21.416
Ankush, why are you still wandering?

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:22.791
Go. Get dressed. Come on.

1:28:22.875 --> 1:28:24.833
And is this the time to skate?

1:28:29.916 --> 1:28:31.458
Everyone is ready outside.

1:28:31.750 --> 1:28:33.958
The wedding procession is on its way.

1:28:34.833 --> 1:28:37.083
I don't want to be weak, Ankush.

1:28:40.166 --> 1:28:42.250
I want to skate one last time.

1:28:51.791 --> 1:28:53.041
Tipu, leave that.

1:28:57.500 --> 1:28:58.500
What?

1:28:58.583 --> 1:29:00.833
Go, quickly. I'll tell didi the plan.

1:29:09.375 --> 1:29:10.333
What happened?

1:29:12.875 --> 1:29:15.583
With Shivam,
we end our Junior Boys category.

1:29:17.375 --> 1:29:19.416
Now moving to the Senior Girls category.

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:21.708
-In the Senior Girls category, we have--
-Vikram.

1:29:28.750 --> 1:29:31.291
We love surprising people in this village!

1:29:31.375 --> 1:29:34.625
So far we've given girls a preference,

1:29:34.708 --> 1:29:38.000
but for now,
we’ll let our boys go first.

1:29:38.083 --> 1:29:43.083
Put your hands together
for the Senior Boys category.

1:29:43.750 --> 1:29:45.583
Rahul!

1:29:46.375 --> 1:29:49.208
He's carving his line
with great speed and focus.

1:29:50.166 --> 1:29:51.166
Well done, Rahul.

1:29:53.125 --> 1:29:55.791
And a wonderful foot-twisting trick!

1:29:56.291 --> 1:29:58.791
Our skate village is rocking it!

1:30:07.583 --> 1:30:10.291
Papa, that fabric fell off.

1:30:12.666 --> 1:30:14.583
Okay, go keep this plate inside.

1:30:29.208 --> 1:30:30.333
You're still here?

1:30:30.916 --> 1:30:32.625
You can't do one thing right.

1:30:33.083 --> 1:30:35.875
-Ankush, I’ve been looking for you.
-Here, take the plate.

1:31:40.458 --> 1:31:42.583
Prerna, hurry!
The wedding procession is here.

1:33:23.791 --> 1:33:25.666
Didi, how did you get out?

1:33:27.833 --> 1:33:30.208
-Girl’s round is still left, right?
-Yeah, run away.

1:33:30.291 --> 1:33:31.958
But how will you skate in this?

1:34:13.916 --> 1:34:14.916
Call Prerna.

1:34:31.708 --> 1:34:32.541
Prerna?

1:34:47.625 --> 1:34:50.041
Our next senior contestant is

1:34:50.125 --> 1:34:52.333
Deepa from Janwar!

1:34:53.416 --> 1:34:54.958
Give her a round of applause.

1:35:26.875 --> 1:35:28.166
Where are you going?

1:35:28.750 --> 1:35:31.250
Wow. Mini is landing trick after trick.

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:33.458
And that's an impressive trick.

1:35:33.541 --> 1:35:35.125
I don't even know what it's called.

1:35:35.208 --> 1:35:38.708
Our little shredders are getting
a lot of inspiration today. Right?

1:35:38.791 --> 1:35:41.333
Let’s hear a big round
of applause for her.

1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.208
Well done, Mini. Well done!

1:35:50.166 --> 1:35:51.916
Now what can be better than

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.166
the queen herself gracing us
with her presence?

1:35:57.125 --> 1:36:00.666
With a huge round of applause,
let's welcome our queen.

1:36:04.250 --> 1:36:06.875
She graciously donated her land
for this skate park.

1:36:06.958 --> 1:36:11.458
Khempur village is privileged to have her
here at this skating competition.

1:36:11.541 --> 1:36:13.708
We welcome you wholeheartedly,
Your Highness.

1:36:15.625 --> 1:36:17.708
Let's hear a big round of applause.

1:36:29.375 --> 1:36:31.708
And our next participant is…

1:36:33.291 --> 1:36:35.833
the last contestant
from the Senior Girls category,

1:36:36.333 --> 1:36:41.291
and the only participant
in this category from our village,

1:36:44.333 --> 1:36:45.166
our very own,

1:36:45.916 --> 1:36:46.791
Prerna!

1:36:51.958 --> 1:36:53.666
Let's give it up for Prerna.

1:37:25.208 --> 1:37:28.208
And with such ease,
she’s done the Bert slide trick.

1:37:47.750 --> 1:37:50.708
She needs to stay on her board
for just 15 more seconds.

1:37:59.458 --> 1:38:00.541
But one minute,

1:38:02.583 --> 1:38:05.000
looks like Prerna is heading
towards the monster bowl!

1:39:16.208 --> 1:39:18.458
Before announcing the winners,

1:39:19.583 --> 1:39:21.958
I'd like to say that

1:39:22.583 --> 1:39:25.916
for the first time,
I'm seeing such joy in this village.

1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:31.416
If we just give our kids
that one opportunity,

1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:37.333
maybe someday we'll find
a world champion from this village.

1:39:40.625 --> 1:39:44.083
But a champion isn’t someone
who just wins.

1:39:45.583 --> 1:39:51.208
A true champion is someone
who shows courage,

1:39:51.291 --> 1:39:53.625
passion and determination
when faced with adversity.

1:39:55.041 --> 1:39:56.625
You did an amazing drop-in.

1:39:56.708 --> 1:39:57.541
Come.

1:39:58.541 --> 1:40:02.375
And today I witnessed
that courage and determination in someone.

1:40:03.208 --> 1:40:05.708
I would like to give that person
a special award.

1:40:05.791 --> 1:40:07.583
Sorry, Papa.

1:40:11.500 --> 1:40:12.541
Prerna Bhil.

1:40:13.666 --> 1:40:14.916
Come on stage.

1:40:16.875 --> 1:40:18.708
Don’t be nervous, come.

1:40:25.500 --> 1:40:26.333
Go.

1:41:35.791 --> 1:41:36.833
Shoes!

1:41:38.875 --> 1:41:40.250
Red color shoes!
