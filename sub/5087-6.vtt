WEBVTT

00:09.333 --> 00:11.000
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
But is it any good?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.367
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.367 --> 00:14.367
but I don't review

00:14.367 --> 00:16.033
food, books, or movies.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.100
I review life itself.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.700
[screams]

00:19.700 --> 00:21.633
[triumphant music]

00:21.633 --> 00:23.333
[parrot squawks]

00:23.333 --> 00:26.867
*

00:26.867 --> 00:28.200
Over here.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.267
*

00:33.267 --> 00:35.967
Hello,
and welcome to the show.

00:35.967 --> 00:38.300
I'm your dedicated life
reviewer, Forrest MacNeil,

00:38.300 --> 00:41.967
and this is my life experience
curator, A.J. Gibbs.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.767
Hello, Forrest.
I cannot wait

00:43.767 --> 00:45.800
to find out what our audience
wants you to do next.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.667
Well, me neither.
Please, let's have at it.

00:47.667 --> 00:50.600
Eli
from Rolla, Missouri...

01:01.400 --> 01:02.933
A William Tell?

01:02.933 --> 01:05.133
I-I don't really know
what that--

01:05.133 --> 01:06.133
I don't know.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.400
Well, let's find out.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.333
What does it mean
and what is it like

01:09.333 --> 01:11.833
to do a William Tell?

01:11.833 --> 01:14.067
(Forrest)
What it was, was horrible.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.300
Oh, my God.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.467
Have you ever heard
this William Tell story?

01:17.467 --> 01:18.633
Apple on the head thing?

01:18.633 --> 01:20.567
Yeah. This guy
in the 14th century

01:20.567 --> 01:24.233
was forced to shoot an apple
off of his son's head

01:24.233 --> 01:25.500
with an arrow.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.767
Yeah, and he did it, too.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.467
(Forrest)
I was faced with
a major problem.

01:29.467 --> 01:32.333
To review shooting an apple
off my son's head with an arrow,

01:32.333 --> 01:36.500
I would have to shoot an apple
off my son's head with an arrow.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.567
Oh, hey, buddy.
Hey, how's it going?

01:38.567 --> 01:40.633
(Forrest voice-over)
As it happened, Eric was
scheduled to fly here

01:40.633 --> 01:42.300
with his grandmother
for the weekend.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.833
Hey, is there anything
in particular

01:43.833 --> 01:45.867
you're looking forward to doing
while you're down here?

01:45.867 --> 01:47.500
No, I don't have anything
planned, really.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.233
Well, I-I do.

01:49.233 --> 01:52.367
I have one,
sort of, activity.

01:52.367 --> 01:55.333
(Forrest voice-over)
That gave me three days
to become a master archer.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.233
[bleep].

01:57.233 --> 02:00.633
(Forrest voice-over)
It seemed unlikely, but then,
what choice did I have?

02:00.633 --> 02:03.167
I need to be really good at
this, you guys.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.300
(Josh)
All right, whoo!

02:04.300 --> 02:05.633
(Tina)
[bleep] that apple.

02:05.633 --> 02:07.233
- [bleep] that apple.
- [bleep] that apple.

02:07.233 --> 02:08.367
(Josh)
[bleep] that apple.

02:08.367 --> 02:09.500
[grunts]

02:09.500 --> 02:11.067
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, [bleep]!

02:11.067 --> 02:12.467
(Forrest voice-over)
On my first day of practice,

02:12.467 --> 02:15.067
I did not come anywhere near
my son's precious face,

02:15.067 --> 02:17.633
and that was all right with me.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.467
My second day went
slightly better than the first.

02:20.467 --> 02:23.133
I think I've been holding this
upside down the whole time.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.133
Look at this.

02:24.133 --> 02:27.400
(Josh)
Come on, Mr. MacNeil.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.500
Oh! Mr. MacNeil,
that's great!

02:29.500 --> 02:30.933
(Tina)
That's, like, five points.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.600
(Josh) You got him.
- It would have been his foot.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.067
Or that would have been
his foot.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.967
All right, let's do this.

02:36.967 --> 02:38.500
(Forrest voice-over)
On the day of Eric's arrival,

02:38.500 --> 02:40.733
I had time for
one last practice,

02:40.733 --> 02:42.167
and I would leave nothing
to chance.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.200
(Josh)
I like the intensity,
Mr. MacNeil.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.967
Yep, it's all about
intensity now.

02:45.967 --> 02:48.400
(Forrest voice-over)
I obviously had
no innate ability

02:48.400 --> 02:50.600
to zip a stick off a string,

02:50.600 --> 02:52.433
so I invested in
the most advanced

02:52.433 --> 02:54.233
stick-zipping equipment
available.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.833
(Forrest)
All right,
Eric, we can do this.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.967
No more [bleep] around.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.533
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

03:06.533 --> 03:08.767
(Tina) Oh, my God.
- Interesting.

03:08.767 --> 03:11.333
[adventurous music]

03:11.333 --> 03:13.833
(Tina) Oh.
- Holy [bleep].

03:13.833 --> 03:16.433
*

03:16.433 --> 03:19.267
You're like a [bleep] elf.
This is insane.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.733
(Josh) Whoo!
(Tina) More!

03:23.933 --> 03:25.500
No!

03:25.500 --> 03:26.700
[grunts]

03:26.700 --> 03:29.500
(Tina)
Use your pain.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.467
(Josh)
Ho ho ho ho!
You're my hero!

03:32.467 --> 03:35.967
No! I would have
killed him five times!

03:35.967 --> 03:38.400
Okay, well, how many sons
do you have?

03:38.400 --> 03:39.700
One!

03:39.700 --> 03:41.467
Then, yeah,
that's a problem.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.433
(Forrest voice-over)
Tina was onto something.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.467
Since I clearly
could not put my boy

03:45.467 --> 03:48.300
at the mercy of
my bow and arrow skills,

03:48.300 --> 03:50.733
perhaps I needed another son.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.667
(woman)
So what kind of child
do you think would be

03:54.667 --> 03:56.333
a perfect match for you?

03:56.333 --> 03:59.300
Um...Well, it needs
to be a boy.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.667
Mm-hmm.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.900
And...

04:02.900 --> 04:06.167
it'd be great if he had
a flat head...

04:08.600 --> 04:10.800
and a thick skull.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.200
Thick skull?

04:13.200 --> 04:16.167
No.

04:16.167 --> 04:18.067
No.

04:18.067 --> 04:19.533
You okay?

04:19.533 --> 04:22.133
This--this is
a terrible idea.

04:22.133 --> 04:26.567
I'm a [bleep] monster.
[cries]

04:26.567 --> 04:29.167
(Forrest voice-over)
And that's when I had
a revelation.

04:29.167 --> 04:32.067
Dad, have you ever shot
a bow and arrow?

04:32.067 --> 04:34.600
A bow and arrow?
Yes, at summer camp.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.067
As a matter of fact,
I won a trophy.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.933
Of course,
it melted in the fire.

04:37.933 --> 04:39.500
You gotta be kidding me.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.133
No, it was plastic.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.133
This was meant to be then.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.067
Come on over here.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.067
(Forrest voice-over)
I realized that the question
I'd been asked was,

04:46.067 --> 04:48.567
what is it like
to do a William Tell?

04:48.567 --> 04:51.300
Not, what is it like to be
William Tell?

04:51.300 --> 04:54.767
I could still experience
a father/son apple shot,

04:54.767 --> 04:56.067
not as the father...

04:56.067 --> 04:57.467
- Okay, here.
- But as the son.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.233
What I need you to do

04:59.233 --> 05:01.533
is just shoot this apple
off my head, okay?

05:01.533 --> 05:03.300
Are you out of your mind?
I can't do that.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.467
Aim it.
Just see if you can aim it.

05:04.467 --> 05:05.667
- Forrest.
- What are you doing?

05:05.667 --> 05:07.067
We have to talk about this

05:07.067 --> 05:10.567
because William Tell did this
700 years ago, right?

05:10.567 --> 05:12.067
We're still
talking about it

05:12.067 --> 05:13.800
because it's impossible.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.933
Look, William Tell didn't
have a bow like this.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.800
Drunken hillbillies are
taking down deer

05:18.800 --> 05:21.300
at 100 yards every weekend
with these things.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.700
You're not drunk, right?

05:22.700 --> 05:25.400
No. Are you?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.667
You can do this.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.433
You won a trophy in this.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.733
Actually, we all
took home a trophy.

05:31.733 --> 05:35.267
We got--the trophy was
for participating.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.700
Everybody took home
an archery trophy?

05:36.700 --> 05:38.067
Yes.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.633
Okay, but still, you did it.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.267
I believe in you.

05:42.267 --> 05:45.733
I just need you to believe in
you as much as I believe in you.

05:45.733 --> 05:49.067
Because if you--
if you don't,

05:49.067 --> 05:51.433
um...

05:51.433 --> 05:54.233
I'm gonna try and shoot an apple
off of Eric's head.

05:54.233 --> 05:57.433
That's--Okay,
just stand there, please.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.067
Dad, you can do it.

06:01.067 --> 06:04.067
- Just focus on the apple.
- [groans]

06:04.067 --> 06:06.067
(Forrest voice-over)
The oppressed people of
14th-century Switzerland

06:06.067 --> 06:07.667
needed someone to show them that

06:07.667 --> 06:09.767
passion achieves the impossible.

06:09.767 --> 06:12.133
William Tell did that.

06:12.133 --> 06:15.067
And today, my father
would do it, too.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.767
Or so I dearly hoped.

06:20.367 --> 06:21.400
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.567
- Do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

06:22.567 --> 06:24.067
- Do it!
- I am gonna do it.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.667
[William Tell Overture
by Gioachino Rossini playing]

06:25.667 --> 06:26.700
[screams]

06:26.700 --> 06:30.500
(Roger) Oh, no, no! God!
- Ow!

06:30.500 --> 06:31.967
Oh, my God!

06:31.967 --> 06:33.267
(Josh)
Mr. MacNeil, he shot you!

06:33.267 --> 06:35.533
(Forrest) I know!
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

06:35.533 --> 06:37.400
No, you have nothing to
apologize for, Dad.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.700
Please do it again, okay?

06:38.700 --> 06:39.800
What?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.767
Don't let this be
for nothing!

06:41.767 --> 06:43.700
Please, Dad.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.200
Try it again. What do you got to
lose at this point?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.067
This is terrible.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.333
Would somebody put the apple
back on my head, please?

06:50.333 --> 06:52.567
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

06:52.567 --> 06:53.667
Okay, thank you, yes.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.833
God that hurts!
Here we go.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.700
You can do it, Dad.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.767
[groans]

06:58.767 --> 07:00.833
[whimpers]

07:00.833 --> 07:02.167
[both groan]

07:02.167 --> 07:05.733
Please, Dad!
[screams]

07:05.733 --> 07:08.100
(Roger)
Oh, God, no!
What have I done?!

07:08.100 --> 07:11.333
[screams]

07:11.333 --> 07:13.133
Do you want me to call
an ambulance?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.467
Yes! Yes.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.133
Okay,
you just tell me when.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.200
Now!
Call an ambulance now!

07:18.200 --> 07:20.600
(Josh)
Mr. MacNeil, maybe if
you just duck down

07:20.600 --> 07:22.333
and you--you put your head where
your shoulder's been,

07:22.333 --> 07:24.633
he'd get it, 'cause he keeps
hitting you in the same spot.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.400
No, no!
No, no, no, I'm done!

07:26.400 --> 07:28.300
Dad. Dad, no,
he's exactly right.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.700
You keep doing
what you're doing,

07:29.700 --> 07:31.800
and I will put the apple
where the arrows are going.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.733
One more.
Only one and one only.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.333
Okay, but please hurry,

07:37.333 --> 07:39.400
'cause I don't think I can hold
this position very long.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.900
I'm going faint
from loss of blood.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.133
You don't have to do this.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.333
I do have to do it.
Thank you, though.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.500
- Forrest.
- Yeah.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.067
I love you, son.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.500
I know.
Okay, but please hurry.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.833
- You're not a perfect man...
- Dad, please hurry.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.367
but you've made a lot of
mistakes in your life--

07:51.367 --> 07:53.067
Dad, I cannot hold
this position very long!

07:53.067 --> 07:54.467
- Okay, I love you.
- I'm going faint

07:54.467 --> 07:55.967
- from the blood loss!
- I want you to be proud of me.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.067
I've always been
proud of you, kid.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.533
So I'm gonna--

07:58.533 --> 08:01.067
Let's go!

08:01.067 --> 08:02.433
- Aah!
- Aah!

08:02.433 --> 08:04.567
[bleep]!

08:04.567 --> 08:06.433
(Tina)
[bleep]! Holy [bleep]!

08:06.433 --> 08:07.733
- Someone call an ambulance!
- Call an ambulance!

08:07.733 --> 08:09.400
- [bleep]!
- I've been shot!

08:09.400 --> 08:12.167
- Call the ambulance!
(Forrest) This is terrible!

08:12.167 --> 08:14.433
(Forrest voice-over)
And that's when I had
another revelation.

08:14.433 --> 08:17.533
When William Tell's son
placed that apple on his head,

08:17.533 --> 08:20.133
he didn't know whether the arrow
would pierce the fruit

08:20.133 --> 08:23.167
or his cherubic
renaissance-era body.

08:23.167 --> 08:24.800
Either thing
could have happened.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.133
What do I do?! How do I fix it?!
I'll cuddle you!

08:28.133 --> 08:30.533
(Forrest voice-over)
So to experience a William Tell,

08:30.533 --> 08:33.700
one only needs to be involved in
a father shooting an arrow

08:33.700 --> 08:35.100
at his son.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.733
Where it lands
is mostly irrelevant.

08:38.733 --> 08:41.800
Doing a William Tell
forces a man

08:41.800 --> 08:44.267
to put the person he feels
most compelled to protect

08:44.267 --> 08:45.867
in mortal danger.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.500
So if you're considering
attempting this feat,

08:48.500 --> 08:51.100
my advice to you is don't.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.200
Doing a William Tell,
two stars.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.800
Oh, and I should add that
my executive assistant, Lucille,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.067
is going to be just fine,

09:00.067 --> 09:01.367
but I can't really say
any more than that

09:01.367 --> 09:03.100
due to pending litigation.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.567
Let's hope a settlement is
reached soon.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.567
Hopefully, this next review
won't hurt a bit.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.867
Oh, I hope you're right.
Yes.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.800
@StalkHore7 Tweets...

09:26.333 --> 09:29.533
Oh, that is
a delightful request.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.767
I'm off to make a wish
come true.

09:31.767 --> 09:34.067
(Forrest voice-over)
It was just MacNeil family luck

09:34.067 --> 09:36.267
that my son, Eric,
had a birthday coming up

09:36.267 --> 09:40.300
and was sure to make a wish
blowing out his candles.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.167
The party was being thrown
by my ex-wife

09:43.167 --> 09:45.567
at the house in San Francisco
where she fled

09:45.567 --> 09:47.433
after our marriage failed.

09:47.433 --> 09:49.633
And I came prepared
to make a splash

09:49.633 --> 09:52.867
wearing a jacket that I'd had
specially designed for parties.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.067
Hey, the fun bus is here!
Choo choo!

09:55.067 --> 09:56.700
(Forrest voice-over)
The prospect of
making my son's day

09:56.700 --> 09:58.767
put me in a happy mood,

09:58.767 --> 10:01.033
so much so that I even began
to feel that today

10:01.033 --> 10:04.167
might open the door to
a new future with Suzanne.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.533
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hello. How are you?

10:06.533 --> 10:07.700
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.967
What happened to your arm?

10:08.967 --> 10:10.533
Oh, I got shot with
a couple of arrows.

10:10.533 --> 10:11.700
- Yeah.
- Sure.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.233
- Nice to see you again.
- You, too,

10:13.233 --> 10:15.167
but there's actually somebody
I'd love for you to meet.

10:15.167 --> 10:16.500
Okay.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.467
Hey, Eric, honey,
where's your best bud?

10:18.467 --> 10:20.900
I think he's in the back
signing autographs.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.367
Oh, okay.
I'll go get him.

10:22.367 --> 10:25.000
Signing autographs? Oh.
How are you?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.667
(Forrest voice-over)
And then, Eric's birthday party
turned into a surprise party,

10:28.667 --> 10:32.000
a terrible, terrible surprise.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.800
My recent review of catfishing

10:33.800 --> 10:36.200
had allowed me to reconnect
with Suzanne

10:36.200 --> 10:38.967
using a false name
and a borrowed face.

10:38.967 --> 10:42.633
My favorite writer is
Agatha Christie.

10:42.633 --> 10:46.033
(Forrest voice-over)
And through this deception,
she and I fell in love again.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.767
The face belonged to
Joe Dale Jr.,

10:48.767 --> 10:51.367
a handsome and dim-witted
professional baseball man.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.133
Did you bring
a cashier's check?

10:53.133 --> 10:54.767
(Forrest voice-over)
To prevent Suzanne from
finding out the truth,

10:54.767 --> 10:57.467
I paid him to end things
via Skype.

10:57.467 --> 11:01.133
Now, this pretty-faced moron
was dating Suzanne.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.767
- Hey, Forrest, Joe.
- Okay.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.833
It's nice to meet you
for the very first time.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.067
- Yeah.
- No.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.067
(Suzanne)
No, you know what it is?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.200
What?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.900
Joe is a professional
baseball player,

11:09.900 --> 11:11.533
so if he's familiar to you
that might be why.

11:11.533 --> 11:13.100
- Is that why?
- Yeah.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.500
'Cause you do
look familiar to me.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.700
I mean, I didn't know that
when I met him.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.900
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, we met online.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.067
I was using an alias,
because, you know.

11:18.067 --> 11:19.333
- Yeah.
- Dad.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.767
- Interesting.
- Joe is the first person

11:20.767 --> 11:23.800
to hit a walk-off home run
in both games of a doubleheader.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.633
That's great. I don't even know
what a doubleheader is

11:25.633 --> 11:26.933
to be honest with you.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.833
To me, it sounds like
a two-faced monster.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.700
(Suzanne)
He's not much of a sports guy.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.633
Like a monster that presents
itself to people one way

11:33.633 --> 11:35.133
- and then the other way...
- I'm so sorry.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.433
It's cake o'clock.
I gotta hit it.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.067
other people are saying
a different thing.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.333
Maybe he doesn't even seem like
a monster on this side,

11:39.333 --> 11:40.400
but on this side,
you know he's a monster.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.733
- Okay.
- Right?

11:41.733 --> 11:42.967
Shh.
I know. I know, man. I--

11:42.967 --> 11:44.233
This is real weird.

11:44.233 --> 11:45.800
Yes,
it's weirder than weird.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.633
It just happened. We were up
here playing the Giants.

11:47.633 --> 11:50.067
I was craving a MILF,
and I looked her up

11:50.067 --> 11:51.733
because I thought it was
a pretty easy way to get laid.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.067
What is a MILF?

11:53.067 --> 11:55.067
MILF, it's like
an old lady I'd like to

11:55.067 --> 11:56.267
[clicks tongue]
[bleep].

11:56.267 --> 11:57.567
Oh, my God.

11:57.567 --> 12:00.133
Now, Eric's grandmother
usually makes vanilla,

12:00.133 --> 12:03.100
but Joe, this time, said
it has to be chocolate.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.100
(Forrest voice-over)
Joe was a terrible person.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.133
What a stark contrast with me,

12:07.133 --> 12:09.800
a man who had come here
to do something wonderful.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.067
I'd like to have a word with
the birthday boy.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.067
Can you young men
go away, please?

12:16.067 --> 12:17.633
[whistles]
Thanks.

12:17.633 --> 12:20.400
What did you just wish for when
you blew out the candles?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.500
Nah, I don't think
you're gonna like it.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.700
Whatever you wished for,
whatever it was,

12:24.700 --> 12:27.533
I am going to make that wish
come true.

12:27.533 --> 12:29.633
(Forrest voice-over)
Eric was understandably hesitant

12:29.633 --> 12:31.600
to share a secret wish,

12:31.600 --> 12:34.633
but to make it come true,
I'd have to know what it was.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.867
- What I wished for...
- Yeah?

12:36.867 --> 12:38.667
was for mom and me
to move back to L.A...

12:38.667 --> 12:40.467
Well...

12:40.467 --> 12:42.400
And to move in with
Joe Dale Jr.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.600
Can you really make
that wish come true?

12:46.600 --> 12:47.967
(Forrest voice-over)
Could I?

12:47.967 --> 12:49.600
I did not know,

12:49.600 --> 12:51.933
but this review meant
I would have to try.

12:51.933 --> 12:53.300
That's what you want?

12:53.300 --> 12:54.500
You don't want a go-kart
or anything like that?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.067
Joe says he has five go-karts
at his house.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.533
Oh,
Joe's got five go-karts.

12:57.533 --> 12:58.800
Oh, my God.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.900
(Forrest voice-over)
This was a devastating,

12:59.900 --> 13:02.300
punishing, miserable request.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.267
I came here prepared to
build a go-kart,

13:05.267 --> 13:07.433
which would have been
hard enough.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.367
Instead, I would have to try
and convince

13:09.367 --> 13:11.100
to former love of my life

13:11.100 --> 13:13.267
to move in with a jerk.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.400
[sighs]

13:15.400 --> 13:18.867
Wow, I was just thinking
about Joe in there.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.433
He's fantastic.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.867
What a--what a great guy.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.833
Yeah, he is great.
I-I really like him.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.133
- Yeah. You do, huh?
- Yeah.

13:25.133 --> 13:26.433
So do I.

13:26.433 --> 13:27.933
I didn't know if
it was gonna be hard for you

13:27.933 --> 13:29.800
and I was even gonna tell you
beforehand,

13:29.800 --> 13:33.167
but you were out getting shot
or whatever.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.933
- Did you know this?
- What?

13:34.933 --> 13:36.533
Okay, so whatever, he's sweet,
he's funny, he's handsome.

13:36.533 --> 13:39.433
He's handsome, of course,
but he loves Agatha Christie.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.733
How cool is that?

13:41.733 --> 13:43.967
- Unbelievably cool.
- Yeah.

13:43.967 --> 13:45.433
(Forrest voice-over)
Incredibly enough,

13:45.433 --> 13:48.533
my wise and thoughtful ex-wife
was genuinely smitten

13:48.533 --> 13:51.933
with a man who is capable
of craving a MILF.

13:51.933 --> 13:54.100
But she was still too sensible
to pick up and move

13:54.100 --> 13:56.200
without an invitation.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.700
For that, I would need to
convince my betrayer.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.900
You guys are basically like my
favorite couple I've ever seen.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.067
I like her, man.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.533
Ever since
I started dating her,

14:04.533 --> 14:06.867
whenever I get a little
something on the side,

14:06.867 --> 14:09.067
I feel pretty bad about it.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.833
Did you say that you have
already cheated on Suzanne?

14:11.833 --> 14:14.333
Yeah, but I'm gonna
try not to.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.067
Yeah, yeah.
No, that would be great.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.667
(Forrest voice-over)
Joe did not strike me
as a family man,

14:18.667 --> 14:20.500
but I could not give up.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.833
You should ask her
to move in with you.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.133
Mm, I gotta tell you.

14:25.133 --> 14:28.200
I like to throw
freaky parties, you know?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.300
Like, good-looking women
at the house in the pool.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.933
Yeah, I'm glad
you're saying that,

14:31.933 --> 14:34.333
because that's how
these guys are as well.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.667
They love to throw down

14:35.667 --> 14:38.967
with good-look--
good-looking women in the pool.

14:38.967 --> 14:42.067
It'll just be the same old
Joe Dale Jr.,

14:42.067 --> 14:44.400
just with a loving partner
to come home to

14:44.400 --> 14:46.167
and a little guy
hanging around

14:46.167 --> 14:47.833
who just thinks
the world of you.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.067
- Whoo!
- I can tell you,

14:49.067 --> 14:50.367
I had that, you know.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.967
You could really
literally just

14:52.967 --> 14:56.233
walk down there
and go get it.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.967
Cheers, man.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.867
Who's ready to play?

15:00.867 --> 15:03.067
(Forrest voice-over)
I had tried my best
to make a wish come true,

15:03.067 --> 15:06.300
but I doubted that a shallow man
like Joe Dale Jr.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.367
would make this sort of
commitment to a woman

15:08.367 --> 15:10.300
no matter how great she is.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.100
[dramatic music]

15:13.100 --> 15:16.367
But a week later, I got the call
that Suzanne and Eric

15:16.367 --> 15:18.567
were moving in with him
in Los Angeles.

15:18.567 --> 15:19.867
- I got it. I got it.
- Are you sure?

15:19.867 --> 15:21.133
I got it. I got it. Oh!

15:21.133 --> 15:22.267
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I got it.

15:22.267 --> 15:23.800
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
(Forrest voice-over)
I had fulfilled my son's wish,

15:25.800 --> 15:28.733
and aside from
the truly awful feelings

15:28.733 --> 15:30.633
associated with
delivering my family

15:30.633 --> 15:33.300
into the hands of
a habitually unfaithful fraud,

15:33.300 --> 15:35.933
I can report that
it was satisfying

15:35.933 --> 15:38.467
to see the wish recipient
so happy.

15:38.467 --> 15:40.700
Dad.
What are you doing here?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.767
Suzanne invited me to stay

15:42.767 --> 15:45.700
in one of Joe Dale Jr.'s
guesthouses.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.967
Sleeping on the floor
in your office

15:47.967 --> 15:50.167
is just doing a number
on my back.

15:50.167 --> 15:53.100
Yeah, Dad, I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.167
He's got a pool, son.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.433
- Enjoy it. Beautiful house.
- Yeah.

16:00.433 --> 16:03.200
(Forrest voice-over)
The idea that making
someone else's wish come true

16:03.200 --> 16:05.367
would involve any sacrifice
on my part

16:05.367 --> 16:07.800
had, honestly, not
occurred to me at all.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.133
At many points in this review

16:10.133 --> 16:13.200
I felt nostalgic for the day
when all I had to worry about

16:13.200 --> 16:15.600
was being shot in the heart
with an arrow.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.833
The power of wish is
a heavy burden

16:18.833 --> 16:21.100
that no man
should have to bear.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.833
Making someone's wish
come true,

16:22.833 --> 16:26.133
half a star.

16:30.400 --> 16:34.067
[triumphant music]

16:34.067 --> 16:36.167
The next review
comes from Elliot

16:36.167 --> 16:38.333
in Homa Hills, Wyoming.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.067
Homa Hills.

16:40.067 --> 16:43.400
Hey, Forrest, what's it like
to be alone in a rowboat?

16:43.400 --> 16:46.433
- Hey, man--
(Forrest) Oh, my God.

16:46.433 --> 16:50.133
A.J. I know our review selection
process is totally random,

16:50.133 --> 16:52.233
but this one feels like
the hand of God

16:52.233 --> 16:54.200
I need it so bad!

16:54.200 --> 16:55.667
Ahh.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.733
Some alone time in a rowboat,
yes, okay, let's do that.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.400
This experience will be
documented by

17:03.400 --> 17:05.233
a mounted onboard camera.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.300
Total solitude.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.667
The terrible arrow injuries
I received to my left shoulder

17:10.667 --> 17:12.333
are making it
more difficult to row,

17:12.333 --> 17:15.067
but I'm not about to let that
ruin this relaxing sojourn

17:15.067 --> 17:16.967
across a peaceful bay.

17:16.967 --> 17:19.433
I took a few extra painkillers

17:19.433 --> 17:22.333
and I gotta try to limit
my range of motion.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.367
[chuckles]
[seagull caws]

17:25.367 --> 17:27.167
Let's follow that bird.

17:27.167 --> 17:29.167
I don't know if
it's the cool breeze

17:29.167 --> 17:31.333
or the sound of lapping water

17:31.333 --> 17:33.333
or the double dose of OxyContin

17:33.333 --> 17:36.367
or the crisp salt air,

17:36.367 --> 17:38.267
but I feel at peace in a way
that I haven't felt

17:38.267 --> 17:41.467
in a long, long time.

17:41.467 --> 17:45.500
Think I'm just gonna lie back
and enjoy it.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.467
(Forrest voice-over)
But perhaps I had allowed myself
to feel too peaceful.

17:49.467 --> 17:52.967
[snores]

17:52.967 --> 17:55.967
[dramatic music]

17:55.967 --> 17:59.900
*

17:59.900 --> 18:01.800
I've been asleep for six hours.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.667
I think I must have drifted
out of the bay

18:04.667 --> 18:06.233
and into the open ocean.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.967
All right, well, I guess I just
gotta row back to shore

18:08.967 --> 18:10.800
as fast as--

18:10.800 --> 18:12.733
Oh, no, no, no.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.367
Oh, where are the oars?!

18:14.367 --> 18:16.767
Where are the oars?!

18:16.767 --> 18:18.833
Oars!

18:18.833 --> 18:20.600
Hello, here's my situation.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.367
I have brought along
no food and no water

18:23.367 --> 18:25.500
and no method
for signaling anyone,

18:25.500 --> 18:27.400
and my cell phone here
doesn't get any service.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.267
I am considering using one of
my shoelaces here

18:30.267 --> 18:32.133
as a fishing line

18:32.133 --> 18:35.167
and pieces of my wallet as bait.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.833
And I only pray that
I am rescued

18:37.833 --> 18:41.500
before that begins to seem like
a viable survival plan.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.700
Jesus Christ.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.367
Fish don't eat wallets.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.867
(Forrest voice-over)
My review of making a wish
come true

19:00.867 --> 19:03.500
had left me metaphorically
lost at sea.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.667
Being literally lost at sea
was even worse.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.200
There is a flashing red light
on the camera now,

19:09.200 --> 19:12.600
which I assume means that
the battery is running low.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.333
I would like to say something to
the love of my life,

19:17.333 --> 19:20.700
my--my ex-wife, Suzanne.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.933
Suzanne, I--

19:23.933 --> 19:26.067
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna die out here.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.867
[static crackles]

19:27.867 --> 19:30.267
[laughs]

19:30.267 --> 19:32.067
Hello.

19:32.067 --> 19:35.667
I do not know how many days
I have been at sea.

19:35.667 --> 19:38.133
(Forrest voice-over)
I had been at sea for 96 days.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.233
It is difficult to look at
this footage now,

19:40.233 --> 19:42.467
but the mere fact of my survival

19:42.467 --> 19:44.867
is a beautiful,
glorious miracle.

19:44.867 --> 19:48.467
I've been swept into some kind
of a floating trash vortex

19:48.467 --> 19:50.267
in the middle of the ocean.

19:50.267 --> 19:53.133
I have been killing and eating
the sea birds

19:53.133 --> 19:55.467
that perch on top of
the garbage.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.167
I've been strangling them
and snapping their necks

19:58.167 --> 20:00.100
with my hands.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.700
And it's not a bad diet.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.933
One of the things that I have
been blessed to find here

20:04.933 --> 20:06.967
in this garbage island

20:06.967 --> 20:09.100
is a battery that works
in this camera

20:09.100 --> 20:10.967
so that I can continue
to talk to you

20:10.967 --> 20:14.400
because I have had important
experiences

20:14.400 --> 20:16.633
to share with you
about rowboats.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.867
They are--
[static crackles]

20:18.867 --> 20:21.233
Wow.

20:21.233 --> 20:23.967
You were lost at sea
for a long time.

20:23.967 --> 20:25.633
Yep.
[laughs]

20:25.633 --> 20:27.633
I want to thank anybody
who has ever contributed

20:27.633 --> 20:30.333
to the great Mid-Pacific
trash flotilla.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.900
If you don't properly dispose
of your garbage,

20:32.900 --> 20:35.133
you saved my life.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.433
I would also like to thank
the gruesome practice

20:37.433 --> 20:39.033
of illegal whale hunting.

20:39.033 --> 20:41.400
For it was a group of
renegade Japanese whalers

20:41.400 --> 20:44.800
who ultimately found me
and brought me to safety.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.267
Arigatou gozaimasu.

20:48.267 --> 20:51.067
Spending time
alone on a rowboat

20:51.067 --> 20:54.200
is a horrifying, desperate
struggle for survival

20:54.200 --> 20:57.767
that cuts a man off from
his life and his loved ones

20:57.767 --> 21:00.600
frequently causing him
to pray for death.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.367
Spending time on a rowboat,

21:02.367 --> 21:05.500
half a star.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.333
The ocean is a force of nature

21:16.333 --> 21:18.567
that must be taken seriously
at all times,

21:18.567 --> 21:20.733
and it's not something to
be trifled with

21:20.733 --> 21:23.467
or toyed with
or--or enjoyed for fun.

21:23.467 --> 21:27.133
I am sorry that
I disrespected the sea!
