01:09.000 --> 01:11.924
<i>A day and a half</i>
after Deep water Horizon exploded,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.606
<i>the flames, fed by crude</i>
from the bottom of the sea,

01:14.680 --> 01:16.728
<i>were simply too big to contain.</i>

01:16.800 --> 01:19.201
<i>For the families</i>
of the 11 missing crew members,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.328
<i>hope of their rescue is fading.</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:24.529
<i>The search for survivors</i>
will end before dawn tomorrow.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.728
<i>The forced</i>
feeding of mud and cement

01:26.800 --> 01:28.848
<i>into the well failed to work.</i>

01:28.920 --> 01:32.970
<i>The well continues to spew oil</i>
with the force of seven fire hoses.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.647
<i>Today, that slick is 12 miles long,</i>
covering 100 square miles.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.405
<i>Winds are coming</i>
from the south and they're strong,

01:39.480 --> 01:42.802
<i>about 30 miles an hour,</i>
pushing that oil towards the coast.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.128
Congressman, all of our sites
are outlined here.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.283
We've got our east operations
all the way up here.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.930
Over here, our west operations.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.288
Up here we're working with local Indian
tribes to protect their burial grounds.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.249
How you doing on boom supply?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.800
Hard boom we clean and reuse,
so we're good there.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.247
Soft boom needs to be replaced
when it's oil soaked, so...

02:05.320 --> 02:07.163
demand is never ending.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.681
It's something new.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.604
It's something we had to figure out
on our own because we're shrimpers.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.160
We didn't know nothing about
cleaning up oil until last week.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.447
Floyd told me
you got six boats.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.841
BP contract them all?
Two of them.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.327
The other four shut down
because we ain't allowed to shrimp.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.164
How much are they paying you?

02:33.240 --> 02:35.402
1350 a day a boat.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.326
And out of that I got to pay for
fuel, crew, all the other expenses.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.688
Normally you'd be making what?
35? Yeah.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.967
Going to have to start
laying off workers soon.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.409
First Katrina took it away
and now BP.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.802
What you going to do?

03:13.760 --> 03:18.129
<i>The chair recognizes the</i>
gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Pryce.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.009
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</i>

03:20.080 --> 03:23.004
<i>Today we saw reports</i>
that BP's spill in the Gulf

03:23.080 --> 03:25.686
<i>has grown to nearly</i>
20 million gallons,

03:25.760 --> 03:28.969
<i>which is roughly twice</i>
the size of Exxon Valdez.

03:29.040 --> 03:33.841
<i>This is the most devastating man-made</i>
environmental disaster in U.S. History.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.003
<i>It's also an economic</i>
and cultural disaster.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.687
People of the Gulf Coast
will be living with this reality

03:40.760 --> 03:44.003
long after the TV cameras
have gone home

03:44.080 --> 03:46.845
and the nation's attention
has turned elsewhere.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.288
Long after the politicians
have finished making their statements,

03:50.320 --> 03:53.005
these people
will continue to suffer.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.566
Today I'm not
a federal official.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.611
Today I'm a resident
of the Louisiana Gulf Coast.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.883
These fishermen,
these restaurant owners,

04:05.960 --> 04:08.645
these folks who run the bait shops
and the corner stores,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.724
they're people I grew up with.
They're people my parents grew up with.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.963
People I look in the eye
every single day.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.805
They've never asked
for a handout in their lives.

04:17.839 --> 04:21.322
They've bled for this country, their sons
and daughters have bled for this country,

04:21.399 --> 04:23.562
and right now
they need our help.

04:23.640 --> 04:28.771
They need firm commitments
from BP and the government

04:28.840 --> 04:31.081
that'll not just
help them rebuild,

04:31.160 --> 04:34.209
but that'll assure them
we stand by their side.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.760
That we have their backs
just like they've had ours.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.811
Everything I know,
everything I love is at risk.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.242
And even though these marshes
lie along coastal Louisiana...

04:51.880 --> 04:55.168
these are America's wetlands.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.801
And even though this is
British Petroleum's spill...

05:03.720 --> 05:07.361
it is America's ocean.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.603
Excuse me, I'd just like to submit the
rest of my statement for the record.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.761
Thank you.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.079
Been calling the house.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.889
I needed time to clear my head.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.530
That was quite
a show you put on.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.125
It wasn't a show.
I dropped the lines

06:25.200 --> 06:26.884
about the necessity
for a central czar.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.201
Most important part of the speech.
You were honest.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.521
And that's the way it came off.
No, I was weak.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.320
You haven't heard.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.521
Who else picked it up?
Everyone.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.443
Today it appears
the sun is shining

06:47.520 --> 06:50.000
on a Louisiana congressman
nobody knows.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.079
You want to milk this.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.447
I want to milk
the shit out of it

06:54.520 --> 06:56.160
and ride it straight
into the Senate seat.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.646
This is what
we've been waiting for.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.088
You're not capitalizing
on the spill.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.810
This...

07:04.840 --> 07:07.001
This is you.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.607
All right.
All right.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.967
We're going to use this, Frank,

07:13.040 --> 07:15.407
to ensure BP and Transocean

07:15.480 --> 07:17.482
take responsibility
for what they've done.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.847
Shine a light
in their goddamn faces.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.329
You're on the 9:15
out of Reagan.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.289
And Colin...

07:28.360 --> 07:31.489
if we're going to do this,
we need to be buttoned up.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.523
I want the Coast Guard
and the EPA closed to press.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.571
But Frank explicitly said... I don't
care what Frank said. This is priority.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.042
Let's keep this tasteful. Would
you consider 20/20 tasteful?

08:39.080 --> 08:42.289
They're going to open
with you on June 15th.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.488
It seems like this speech
is going to have some legs.

09:03.840 --> 09:08.323
Congressman, care to
comment on yesterday's speech?

09:08.440 --> 09:12.047
Jen, how you doing this morning?
Hanging in there, sir.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.124
Unfortunately, the congressman requested
this be a closed-door meeting.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.528
Sorry, folks.
Are you running for Senate?

09:18.600 --> 09:21.524
Since you were last here, we've made
a significant number of changes.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.285
Just trying to be more
aggressive containing the oil.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.522
How often are you receiving
shipments of soft boom?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.399
Not often enough.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.448
<i>I'll</i> see what I can find
out and circle back.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.649
If you need anything else, you call me.
You've got my personal number.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.122
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.407
Enlighten me, Mr. Morris,
who do I need to call

09:41.480 --> 09:43.847
to get trucks bringing in
soft boom every day?

09:43.920 --> 09:46.651
Admiral Allen?
Goddamned president?

09:46.720 --> 09:50.406
No, no, no. Believe me, I understand,
and I'm not trying to be rude.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.879
I'm just sick
of all this posturing.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.689
You don't think I've been
through this before?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.445
Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.047
Thank you. That's all
I wanted to hear.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.451
Louisiana needs
the oil industry

10:05.520 --> 10:07.887
and the oil industry
needs Louisiana.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.561
That was true 100 years ago
and it will be true in another 100 years.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.486
The spill was a tragedy,

10:15.560 --> 10:20.327
but it is in everyone's best interest
to keep American oil healthy.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.446
My husband isn't
doubting how reliant

10:23.520 --> 10:25.761
our local economy
is on industry.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.931
My fund runs a diversified
energy portfolio

10:29.000 --> 10:31.002
with an emphasis
on Gulf producers.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.243
I know you've leaned left
on energy in the past,

10:34.360 --> 10:38.126
but I'm looking to back a horse
that will support our interests.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.129
You can find a lot
of politicians around here

10:40.240 --> 10:42.163
in the party whose interests
align with yours.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.766
Why me?
You're a winner.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.563
People are talking about you, Congressman.
Even in my world.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.723
Well, then, you should know
I don't pander to campaign financing.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.691
Well, you won't win the Senate seat
unless you reconsider.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.250
I'm sorry, I was under the
impression this was a lobby meeting.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.402
We haven't decided
if we're going to run for Senate.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.050
Colin, just hear him out.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.646
We are in the middle
of a recession.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.848
This election is going
to be about the economy.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.924
And a moratorium will be
more devastating than the spill itself.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.525
Mark, I don't think
you quite understand,

11:15.600 --> 11:17.762
I'm not just advocating
for a temporary moratorium.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.649
I think we ought
to phase out drilling altogether.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.485
<i>Colin.</i>
Oil is an addiction.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.804
And right now it's going to be pretty
damn tricky to deny how harmful it is,

11:26.880 --> 11:29.531
how antiquated it is.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.922
We need to develop
a sustainable infrastructure.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.923
Mark, you're a man
with foresight.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.607
You know green is how
we ought to be creating jobs.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.206
Am I hearing
what I think I'm hearing?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.085
I'm sorry.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.849
We've wasted your time.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.719
You're not going to win.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.131
We'll see.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.679
It's not smart.

11:51.680 --> 11:55.287
You told him we're planning to run
before we've announced.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.528
You humiliated me.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.650
Do you have any idea how much
business my firm does with that man?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.609
I didn't ask you to do that.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.166
I won't be beholden
to Mark Lavin or anyone else.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.925
<i>That speech was a godsend.</i>

12:09.000 --> 12:12.209
Don't blow it.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.799
What's wrong?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.319
Nothing.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.765
See you at home.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.042
Frank told me you've been
calling the office.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.600
Why would you do that?

12:36.680 --> 12:38.887
What were you thinking, Lucy?

12:38.960 --> 12:41.611
I'm sorry.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.523
Terrence knows about us.

12:45.320 --> 12:50.201
He came home drunk last night talking
all sorts of shit, and I don't know.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.248
But don't worry,
he ain't going to say nothing.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.330
I think you've had enough.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.970
Don't you think you've
fucking had enough?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.610
No.
I do.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.724
Okay, I'm sorry, Lucy, okay?

13:09.800 --> 13:12.290
I'm sorry.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.169
I miss you, Colin.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.449
Please.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.721
Just sit with me.
Just for a minute. Please.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.403
Tell it like it is, Pryce!

14:30.480 --> 14:32.960
You've got my vote.
All right, brother.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.128
<i># Sun come up #</i>

14:59.200 --> 15:02.921
<i># It' was blue and gold #</i>

15:05.520 --> 15:07.602
<i># Sun come up #</i>

15:07.640 --> 15:10.928
<i># It' was blue and gold #</i>

15:13.760 --> 15:15.364
<i># Sun come up #</i>

15:15.440 --> 15:19.081
<i># It' was blue and gold... #</i>

15:21.480 --> 15:23.608
You need to get ready.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.809
Car is picking us up
in 15 minutes.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.689
The Parish School Board fundraiser.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.082
Sit with me for a minute.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.966
Just one minute,
and I promise <i>I'll</i> cooperate.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.529
Since when did we start
stocking the house with alcohol?

15:47.600 --> 15:50.171
You've been sober for 16 years.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.567
I think we're safe.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.564
Besides, we can't all
get high on Diet Coke.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.491
You remember
our first legislature run?

16:03.480 --> 16:08.520
Planting posters at 2:00 a.m.
On the median of Highway 90?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.409
Two kids,
fresh out of law school.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.766
Colin...

16:16.680 --> 16:19.206
I want you to see
someone with me.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.444
I know you don't want to,
but we don't have a choice.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.889
Did you have a choice

16:27.920 --> 16:31.129
when you slept with that
27-year-old cheerleader coach?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.239
Frank told you.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.641
Who fucking cares who told me?

16:39.720 --> 16:42.210
I'm sorry.

16:50.040 --> 16:54.011
I was trying, Deb.
Believe me, I really was.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.889
Do you expect me
to congratulate you

16:55.960 --> 16:58.566
because you tried to keep
your dick in your pants?

16:59.880 --> 17:01.848
What is it you want to hear?

17:01.920 --> 17:06.323
That I'm fine you keep risking
everything we've worked for?

17:09.920 --> 17:13.288
Not everything
is about our career.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.242
I wish that were true.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.683
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.605
All right, good job, girls.
Good job.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.007
<i>Lucy Hall?</i>

17:45.280 --> 17:48.284
Kara, take over for a couple minutes, okay?
Okay. No problem.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.328
<i>I'm a reporter</i>
for the Lafitte Gazette.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.209
<i>As uncomfortable as this is,</i>

17:52.280 --> 17:55.204
I got to ask about your relationship
with Congressman Pryce.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.011
There must be some mistake.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.765
Honestly, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.447
You've been elected twice in a district
that is 60 percent African-American

18:04.560 --> 18:07.689
and one that has historically elected
black officials since the Seventies.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.730
<i>What do you think</i>
that says about you?

18:10.800 --> 18:13.371
Well, I think it says
a lot about the city.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.842
I took office in 2006
straight after Katrina.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.322
People were rightfully
craving change.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.961
Folks don't care what color your skin is
anymore, what your economic standing is.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.324
What people want, what they need
is a leader to produce.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.291
I spent eight years in the state
legislature, I did a term in city council.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.522
My wife is a well-respected attorney
around here.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.170
So I think
it's a matter of trust.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.208
You grew up in a political family.
Yes, sir.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.851
Your father, Rayne Pryce, was
mayor during the Seventies.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.729
He created
numerous opportunities

18:42.800 --> 18:44.279
for the city's
black population.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.045
I'd imagine folk down here
still love your daddy, don't they?

18:47.120 --> 18:49.168
Yes, they do.
Very much.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.004
Needless to say,
the Civil Rights Movement

18:51.080 --> 18:52.684
wasn't popular
in the South back then.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.889
What he did, it took guts.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.440
Talk to me about
his post-mayoral career.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.731
It's no secret that Rayne lost
three consecutive Senate elections

19:03.800 --> 19:06.724
and was involved
in a number of incidents.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.006
What happened to him?

19:12.480 --> 19:15.086
My father
is an alcoholic, Byron.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.288
<i>No one is</i>
available to take your call.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.089
<i>Please leave a mess...</i>

19:22.720 --> 19:24.563
Come on, Colin.
Come on.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.842
Let's focus on the
fact that for the first time

19:26.920 --> 19:29.366
since the storm, people are
moving back into the city.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.681
Which makes the spill
that much more devastating.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.326
Right. And that's precisely
why we need to remain vigilant,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.044
why we need to hold
all parties accountable.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.966
Now, BP has vowed to pay
all legitimate claims,

19:40.040 --> 19:42.771
but folks don't have a lot of room
to wait around for checks to come

19:42.840 --> 19:44.808
or I should say
not to come in the mail.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.645
And I want people to know
I'm going to be there for them.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.485
Get rid of that suit.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.611
Whoa, don't touch that oil
with your bare hands.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.603
Use some gloves, man.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.843
All right, we're taking off
in 15 minutes, fellas.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.604
Terrence?

20:00.680 --> 20:03.011
Terrence Hall?

20:04.240 --> 20:06.891
What's next for you? Any plans
to run, say, for the Senate?

20:06.960 --> 20:09.884
Well, that's a ways off. Right now
we need to focus on the oil spill.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.769
Right now I have
a job representing

20:11.840 --> 20:14.286
the Second District
of Louisiana in Congress.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.203
I think we have enough here.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.248
It's been a real pleasure.
Thank you, Colin.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.681
Thank you for having me, Byron.
Yes, sir.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.603
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.130
He's in the kitchen.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.725
How long before
a major picks this up?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.044
I'd give it until the morning.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.930
People are going to think he knew
that slut was the fisherman's wife.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.571
She's right. They're going to
think he knew the fisherman.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.921
Terrence.
What?

21:31.000 --> 21:34.402
The fisherman.
His name is Terrence Hall.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.605
An NBC affiliate has footage
of me speaking at his oyster company.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.889
That's how I met the girl.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.521
We'll start polling damage
first thing in the morning.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.763
Well, I'm going to have to come
clean, so set a press conference.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.841
I think we should
hold off on that.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.048
I think we need to see how
this is going to play out.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.407
Why? You think it's
going to blow over?

21:56.480 --> 21:58.801
No, I don't think
it's going to blow over,

21:58.920 --> 22:01.321
but I think it's possible
that we can weather this.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.562
Frank, it's not like
my husband committed a crime.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.725
With all due respect, have you
forgotten what's going on out there?

22:07.800 --> 22:08.959
How do you think
it's going to look

22:08.960 --> 22:11.122
when people find out
that Congressman Pryce,

22:11.200 --> 22:13.726
the superhero
of the BP oil spill

22:13.760 --> 22:16.286
is fucking the wife
of a local fisherman,

22:16.360 --> 22:18.089
the black wife
of a black local fisherman?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.685
How do you think
that's going to look?

22:19.760 --> 22:21.489
You're being dramatic.
Oh, am I?

22:21.560 --> 22:23.039
This is going to snowball.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.283
Colin is not going to have
one solitary friend in Washington.

22:26.360 --> 22:30.206
Not with every person in America
having watched him cry

22:30.280 --> 22:32.931
on national television
five days ago.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.321
Maybe you're right.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.129
But we need to stay cool.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.807
Think about Owens
and the prostitution scandal.

22:39.920 --> 22:43.083
That was less than a year ago.
This is Louisiana.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.124
Owens was re-elected.
We're not going to be in November.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.851
Colin is a white congressman
in a black district.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.491
He can barely win here
with nothing hanging over him.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.450
That's why the Senate made sense,
where there are at least white voters.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.488
Still does.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.051
What's on for tomorrow?

23:06.040 --> 23:08.884
The claims fair. That's right.
The claims fair.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.406
The release go out yet?
No, not yet.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.528
Well, let's see that it does.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.331
That's what you should
be focusing on.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.404
Not this bullshit.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.088
Come on, let's get some sleep.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.689
Yeah?

24:32.760 --> 24:36.321
<i>Hi, Congressman Pryce?</i>
Hi, it's Jen Wyman.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.759
Who?

24:37.760 --> 24:39.285
<i>It's Jen.</i>

24:39.360 --> 24:41.203
Lieutenant Wyman
from the Coast Guard?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.009
Oh, Jen, of course.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.651
<i>What's on your mind?</i>
We got a real problem here.

24:45.720 --> 24:50.362
We haven't received a shipment of soft boom
in over a week, and we're running real low.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.966
Projections show the oil moving
west and we don't have enough

24:53.040 --> 24:55.361
<i>to protect the western coastline</i>
of Mississippi.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.283
I'm sorry to call
on your personal line, sir,

24:57.360 --> 24:59.806
but you did say to reach out
if there's an emergency.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.160
You haven't heard
what's been going on?

25:04.800 --> 25:07.211
<i>What's wrong, sir?</i>

25:08.600 --> 25:12.650
I'm going to put you in touch
with my friend, Dave Erikson,

25:12.720 --> 25:16.122
President of Plaquemines Parish.
He'll be able to help you.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.841
<i>Bernadette, you're on in three...</i>

25:21.920 --> 25:24.491
<i>Over the weekend,</i>
calls for a resignation

25:24.560 --> 25:26.324
<i>have intensified with statements</i>

25:26.400 --> 25:29.290
<i>from the House Minority Leader</i>
and National Committee Chair.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.601
Both said a temporary
leave of absence is not enough.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.762
This has become
a sensational story,

25:33.840 --> 25:36.207
a symbol to many of everything
that's wrong in Washington.

25:36.280 --> 25:40.046
Louisiana simply can't
afford to face this disaster

25:40.120 --> 25:43.408
with a scandal that could distract
from the real problems at hand.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.161
Price couldn't even attend
his own claims fair.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.402
Thank you, Jimmy.
All right, sir.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.839
Long time, Pryce.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.922
Oh, how's the wife, Stan?

25:52.960 --> 25:56.681
Busting my balls as usual.
That's what they do.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.764
Mm-hmm. Got anything for me? How's your son doing?
Is he going to resign?

25:59.840 --> 26:02.810
Did he know she was
the fisherman's wife?

26:02.880 --> 26:04.530
Just remember this, folks,

26:04.600 --> 26:07.843
Louisiana has always been
one big family.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.362
And we don't abandon our family
when they make a mistake.

26:11.440 --> 26:15.604
I wouldn't be standing here today
if that truth failed to exist.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.523
Thank you. Mr. Pryce!

26:22.880 --> 26:26.327
Now, Moulay Ismail,
that Moroccan ruler,

26:26.400 --> 26:28.971
fathered 900 children
with his concubines.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.646
900 children.

26:31.720 --> 26:35.611
Genghis Khan, well,
he made old Ismail look barren.

26:35.680 --> 26:39.969
One out of every 200 men
on this planet has a direct line

26:40.000 --> 26:41.650
stretching back
to that son of a bitch.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.290
Is that right? Yeah.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.682
What's your point, Dad? Point
is, a lot of powerful men,

26:46.760 --> 26:53.484
JFK, FDR, Clinton,
behave the same way.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.564
Now, I was never much
of a philanderer when I was in office,

26:56.640 --> 26:59.325
but I get where
you're coming from.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.084
No offense, Miss Deborah.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.605
All right, that's enough.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.841
What am I doing here?

27:08.920 --> 27:12.481
I haven't heard from you
for over a year,

27:12.560 --> 27:15.882
now you want me
to be a part of this fiasco?

27:16.400 --> 27:18.811
I didn't invite you.

27:20.200 --> 27:25.366
Rayne, seeing as how you're uniquely
qualified on the subject of scandals,

27:25.440 --> 27:28.284
why don't you give
your son some advice?

27:31.200 --> 27:32.964
Want my advice?

27:33.040 --> 27:34.929
Fuck them.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.083
Fuck the party.
Fuck the administration.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.679
Hell, fuck the people.

27:39.680 --> 27:43.127
This spill will be over soon,
and they'll forgive you.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.328
You just got to fight
through it like a man.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.041
Something funny about what I said?
Like a man?

27:50.120 --> 27:51.963
We're in the middle
of a disaster here.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.771
People are suffering
and I can't even leave my house.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.888
I've already left
these people out to dry.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.610
This ain't about
you doing your job...

27:58.680 --> 28:00.842
Of course not.
It was never about that for you.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.880
I was the best mayor this city ever had.
And then you lost again and again.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.570
Why are you here?
Why is he here?

28:05.640 --> 28:08.291
Colin, I understand you're
under an enormous amount of pressure,

28:08.360 --> 28:10.169
but you need to think
about yourself,

28:10.240 --> 28:12.242
and you need to think about us.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.047
Colin, look at me.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.164
Look at me!

28:23.680 --> 28:26.001
You're not going to resign.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.163
I've decided to resign.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.722
I think you're
doing the right thing.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.848
I need you to help me
get through this.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.729
Why? It's over.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.529
I'm not retiring.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.809
We'll miss the Senate
run, I know that, but...

29:39.920 --> 29:42.082
after the spill's over.

29:43.960 --> 29:48.409
Look, I can't name anyone
who has come back

29:48.480 --> 29:50.482
after a resignation
and been elected again.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.683
You need to think about doing
something else with your life.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.849
You remember why I hired you?

30:05.040 --> 30:07.122
Because my father
worked for your father

30:07.240 --> 30:08.924
and you thought
he was a miracle worker?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.685
No, that's why I sought you out.
Why'd I hire you?

30:11.760 --> 30:13.603
What'd I tell you when we met?
Colin, please.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.681
What'd I say?

30:17.280 --> 30:19.169
That I don't have
my head up my ass

30:19.240 --> 30:21.925
like those other
Beltway pricks.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.490
I trust you, Kate.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.810
You want some free advice?

30:28.040 --> 30:30.566
Stay out of the press.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.445
Stay out of the press
for a long time.

30:33.520 --> 30:37.320
Give people time
to forgive you.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.679
How long are we talking?

30:38.680 --> 30:41.843
I don't know.
You are in unchartered waters.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.444
<i>Congressman, the public would like</i>
to hear your side of the story!

30:52.520 --> 30:54.966
<i>Congressman Pryce,</i>
when will you step down?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.049
I don't know
what hurts more...

31:03.120 --> 31:06.920
The fact that
you're stepping down

31:07.000 --> 31:09.765
or that I wasn't
the first person you told.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.727
This isn't about the spill.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.721
Or the people or you not
being able to do your job.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.090
You're just scared.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.290
You're just scared everyone
will stop loving you.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.842
Your whores, your father,
your constituents.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.763
It's all the same.
Stop.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.285
Would you just stop?

31:46.480 --> 31:48.642
I don't care
about this city anymore.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.324
If you resign...

32:06.400 --> 32:08.845
I'm going to leave you.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.570
Good afternoon.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.928
<i>Let's get some reaction</i>
now to what we've been hearing

33:00.000 --> 33:01.519
<i>from Senator Tom Owens</i>
of Louisiana,

33:01.520 --> 33:03.488
<i>whose state, of course,</i>
has been the hardest hit.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.927
<i>What's your immediate</i>
reaction, Senator?

33:06.000 --> 33:09.561
<i>Hallelujah. Let's hope that the</i>
spill has indeed been contained.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.041
<i>Let's hope this cap holds</i>
and they can finally

33:12.120 --> 33:14.964
<i>- kill that well and stop the flow of oil.</i>
- 87 days.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.327
<i>That's, of course, how long</i>
this has all been unfolding.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.004
<i>Give us a little bit</i>
of a sense of what

33:19.080 --> 33:21.560
<i>the Gulf Coast residents</i>
are feeling right now.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.961
<i>Well, there</i>
is a sense of relief, sure.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.646
<i>But what you have to understand</i>
is right now folks are concerned

33:26.720 --> 33:28.643
<i>with where their next</i>
paycheck is coming from,

33:28.720 --> 33:30.484
<i>how they're going</i>
to pay their mortgage,

33:30.560 --> 33:32.449
<i>how they're going</i>
to put food on the table.

33:32.600 --> 33:36.491
<i>For us right now this is only the</i>
beginning of a long rebuilding process.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.643
<i>And we're all just</i>
a little numb right now.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.087
<i>But yes, this is</i>
certainly good news, Wolf.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.483
<i>Colin, it's me.</i>
Pick up if you're there.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.164
<i>I'm reminding you</i>
about your 9:00 a.m.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.811
<i>With Grandalf's</i>
Fisherman's Co-op.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.202
<i>I'm hoping you're already on your way.</i>
Please don't be late again.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.248
<i>Anyway, I'll see you</i>
at the foundation.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.203
We try shrimping,

35:33.280 --> 35:35.280
but since the spill,
there ain't nothing out there.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.727
And I could have a boat
on the water for three hours,

35:37.800 --> 35:40.485
it comes back with barely enough
to make a gumbo with.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.040
People think it don't hurt
because they capped the well

35:43.160 --> 35:44.439
and they cleaning up
and all that,

35:44.440 --> 35:46.169
but I ain't never seen the
water this dead before.

35:46.240 --> 35:49.244
I sympathize,
Mr. Provich, I do.

35:49.320 --> 35:52.130
But Louisiana National simply
isn't in a position to help.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.329
Seems to me this is a matter you should
take up with the claims fund BP set up.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.691
Claims process is fucked.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.359
Excuse my English.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.488
Ain't none of us
got a penny from BP

36:03.560 --> 36:05.847
since the emergency funding
back in May.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.605
I'm sorry to hear that, but
we have a policy... A policy?

36:08.680 --> 36:10.808
I've had to lay off
half my workers.

36:10.880 --> 36:14.089
We've been clients
of National for 15 years.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.481
We just looking
for a little help.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.723
Please, let's all calm down.
Sorry I'm late.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.723
I'd like a word
with Mr. Musgrave

36:21.760 --> 36:23.603
if it's all right with y'all.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.482
Now, Bill,
over the past few months,

36:29.560 --> 36:33.360
my organization has been providing
legal counsel to the cooperative.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.091
Forgive me, Mr. Pryce,
I'm not familiar with your organization.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.561
It's a New Orleans
based nonprofit, pro bono

36:38.600 --> 36:40.967
for small business owners
affected by the spill.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.849
I'm their attorney.

36:42.920 --> 36:47.608
Now, this is our proposal
to uniformly restructure

36:47.680 --> 36:50.251
the co-op's boat
and real estate mortgages.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.606
This is BP's obligation,
not ours.

36:55.680 --> 36:59.969
You know damn well these men aren't getting
any payments from the GCCF anytime soon.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.691
They're already in default,
and if you don't come through,

37:02.760 --> 37:04.444
they won't make it
through another season.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.205
If you foreclose,
the liquidation value

37:07.280 --> 37:11.365
will be less than keeping these fishermen
in business while the industry recovers.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.410
This is very much
in your interest as well.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.086
It's too low.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.164
Well, what are our options?

37:27.240 --> 37:30.005
File for Chapter 11.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.003
It's not ideal,
but it'll allow us

37:32.080 --> 37:34.481
to have your assets
revalued in bankruptcy court,

37:34.560 --> 37:36.642
which would force National
to cooperate.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.371
We don't want to go down that road.
<i>It'll</i> taint our names.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.331
I understand, Hal. But at this
point it's all about surviving.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.402
You can handle this?

37:47.480 --> 37:51.724
I have a number of clients in the
same position as your co-op, Hal.

37:51.800 --> 37:55.566
Hotels, restaurants,
even a used car salesman in Lafitte.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.405
It's going to take money
and it's going to take manpower.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.926
Yeah, money you ain't got.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.365
I'm working on it.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.527
Thank you, Colin.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.086
Mr. Pryce,
I'm from The Daily Kingfish.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.447
I already told you guys,
I'm not doing interviews.

38:25.520 --> 38:30.003
The story's on the GCCF. The focus
will be on your foundation.

38:30.080 --> 38:33.163
Do you think it'll be enough
to get you re-elected someday, Mr. Pryce?

38:33.240 --> 38:35.208
Don't be a jackass.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.888
Sorry, we're running
a little behind today.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.361
We'll be with you
as soon as we can.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.726
Morning.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.488
We're backed up out there.
How about a little help?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.685
This is the proposal
for Billick Canner to outsource.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.282
How high?

39:02.280 --> 39:05.011
Did you explain to Billick
that this is for fucking charity?

39:05.080 --> 39:08.129
And I politely reminded him
that you were his mentor at Tulane.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.721
Even if we get Billick
down to 100 an hour,

39:18.800 --> 39:22.168
we still need 200 here to take the
fishery co-op through bankruptcy.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.722
And that doesn't include the
restaurant groups or anyone else.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.491
I'll wire more money.
You don't have more money.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.245
I have enough to bring on a few more
employees to help with the raise.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.322
The raise?
Maybe that would make sense

39:33.400 --> 39:36.324
if we had even a modicum of
success with our current setup.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.768
It's just difficult because
of your... My what?

39:40.640 --> 39:43.005
My reputation?

39:43.640 --> 39:45.165
You're not thinking clearly.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.529
It's a great cause.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.284
It's just not working.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.369
<i>BP's compensation fund</i>
has made a final settlement payment

40:19.440 --> 40:22.489
<i>to one out of 91,000 people</i>
waiting for checks,

40:22.560 --> 40:26.645
and that was a $10 million
payout to a BP business partner.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.725
The talk line
is 555-261-1677.

40:30.800 --> 40:35.601
Of course, today, our guest is Louisiana
Attorney General Chris Wilcox.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.046
There have been rumors that you would
support a permanent ban on drilling.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.559
Those aren't just rumors.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.642
Some would call that
a radical position.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.644
It's radical to those who haven't
researched alternative energy.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.883
No one's saying it's going to
be easy, but mark my words,

40:49.960 --> 40:53.965
the green energy revolution is going
to dwarf the technology revolution.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.641
We need to be forward thinking.
Let's go.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.166
And quite frankly,
we don't have any time to waste.

41:03.120 --> 41:07.170
But I heard Wilcox is going to run for Senate.
He hasn't decided that.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.323
That's funny, because I heard
you're going to run his campaign.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.362
It's a small town.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.726
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

41:20.520 --> 41:23.842
So, what do you have in mind? Consultant.
We'd keep it dark.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.322
And what do you get out of being a shadow
consultant for Wilcox's Senate campaign?

41:27.400 --> 41:28.879
I do good work for Chris,

41:28.880 --> 41:32.089
maybe he gives me
a position down the line.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.002
Can I get you two something else? Yes, ma'am.
<i>I'll</i> have another Diet Coke.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.445
I'm good.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.200
Sure you don't want a beer?

41:42.280 --> 41:44.088
Or a bourbon?

41:45.760 --> 41:47.444
It's a small town.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.091
I'm fine.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.924
Trust me, I'm fine.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.809
It's too risky.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.360
If word gets out,
the campaign could be damaged.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.329
We've known each other
since high school.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.764
I'm asking you for a favor.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.921
Nine months.
It's just been nine months.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.359
Kate!

42:20.360 --> 42:24.604
Kate, God damn it,
I completely forgot.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.886
It's fine.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.128
I have a 6:00 p.m., so we
don't have a lot of time.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.439
How long are you in town for?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.408
I'm leaving in the morning.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.687
Do you have dinner plans?
Let me take you to Cochon.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.764
No. I mean, yes.
I can't tonight.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.968
Mostly bloggers and local.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.889
It's what you'd expect.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.002
Speculation about
a return to politics,

42:49.080 --> 42:51.367
questions about the motives
behind your organization.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.920
And people calling me
a narcissistic asshole.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.080
I warned you the press
was going to spin it this way.

42:56.120 --> 42:58.168
You didn't wait long enough
for the dust to settle.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.890
At least you haven't
commented publicly.

42:59.960 --> 43:03.760
I just don't understand how my work
can be construed as a negative.

43:03.840 --> 43:07.287
I mean, this isn't
some resume builder, Kate.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.044
Then why do you
have a publicist?

43:10.280 --> 43:11.964
No good deed goes unscrutinzed?

43:12.040 --> 43:14.202
Not when you're a politician.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.049
How are you, Kate?
Me?

43:22.280 --> 43:24.726
I'm great.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.485
Everything is great.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.449
Do you really want
to know how I am?

43:29.520 --> 43:31.568
Yeah.
Well...

43:32.360 --> 43:36.046
Let's see, my husband and I
recently separated.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.009
I'm thinking of leaving my job.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.290
My kids are a pain in the ass.

43:42.360 --> 43:45.091
Other than that, I'm great.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.204
Oh, come on, blow off your 6:00 p.m.
And get a drink with me.

43:50.280 --> 43:55.241
You don't want to be burdened by some
37-year-old woman's midlife crisis, believe me.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.362
Let's get back to it, shall we?

43:57.440 --> 43:59.283
You're only 37?
Fuck off.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.925
Is it terrible that
I'm drinking with you?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.685
How loose is your definition
of terrible?

44:20.240 --> 44:22.891
You're not going to end up...

44:22.960 --> 44:26.362
passed out naked
in some doorway?

44:26.440 --> 44:29.011
No, it was never like that.

44:29.080 --> 44:33.961
Well, maybe a couple of times.

44:34.040 --> 44:38.045
No, I was a functioning alcoholic
until I wasn't.

44:51.040 --> 44:54.601
You know, sometimes I look back on
my life, what was driving my life,

44:54.680 --> 44:57.445
Jesus, I don't know,

44:57.520 --> 45:01.764
with all the campaigning
and the meetings

45:01.840 --> 45:03.729
and the speeches...

45:08.480 --> 45:10.005
I just miss it, you know?

45:19.080 --> 45:21.401
This will get easier.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.447
We said we wouldn't do this.

46:22.680 --> 46:26.480
You're a real special one,
you know that?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.207
Hey, Maria.
Ls Mrs. Pryce home?

47:02.280 --> 47:04.681
I'm sorry, Mr. Pryce.
She's still at the office.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.486
She asked me to come by and drop
off these papers from the lawyers.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.689
It's good to see you, Mr. Pryce.
You, too.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.410
<i>Colin.</i>

47:26.720 --> 47:28.688
<i>Colin.</i>

47:37.080 --> 47:38.439
Hello, James.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.090
How you doing?

47:40.160 --> 47:42.049
I spoke to your doctor.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.690
You're going
to need to have surgery.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.364
What for?

47:45.440 --> 47:48.649
70 percent of my liver
has stopped dead.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.286
I'm making arrangements
to take care of the bills.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.448
I don't want your damn money.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.842
You're in the red from
financing your last campaign.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.763
You don't have any money, Dad.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.968
Well, don't shit your pants.

48:03.960 --> 48:08.488
You ain't going to be saddled
with my debt or my fiascos.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.407
I wouldn't do that
to your wife.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.362
Yeah.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.528
How's that pro bono work going?

48:21.600 --> 48:23.119
Could be worse.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.088
Not what I heard.

48:25.160 --> 48:28.164
My advice is stop
spending your own money.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.651
Keep it simple.

48:31.080 --> 48:32.809
You don't have to be the hero.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.609
You just have
to make it look good.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.087
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

48:37.160 --> 48:39.242
You know, it's funny.

48:39.320 --> 48:43.962
I walk around this city, people
come up to me to shake my hand,

48:44.040 --> 48:47.931
want to thank me for doing the things
I did for them while I was mayor.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.446
They don't remember
anything after that.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.444
The speeches I gave
under the influence.

48:53.520 --> 48:57.047
That fucking spitting incident.

48:57.160 --> 48:59.925
None of it.

49:00.040 --> 49:05.444
Yes, sir. Louisiana
is a mighty funny place.

49:05.520 --> 49:08.000
You'll be back
on that horse soon enough.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.924
Is that what you think this is?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.968
Some sort of publicity stunt?

49:13.040 --> 49:14.644
Well, ain't it?

49:21.320 --> 49:23.687
You mind getting me some more?

49:24.480 --> 49:28.087
You shouldn't be drinking
or smoking for that matter.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.041
You sound
just like your mother.

49:34.440 --> 49:36.329
May she rest in peace.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.006
What?

49:43.120 --> 49:46.442
You may hate my guts,

49:46.520 --> 49:49.364
but you turned out all right.

49:49.440 --> 49:52.125
After all, the apple
didn't fall too far.

49:55.880 --> 49:58.360
You really think you're better
than me, don't you?

49:59.480 --> 50:01.050
No, I don't.

50:03.280 --> 50:04.805
But I'm nothing like you.

50:58.280 --> 51:01.443
Hey there.
You're up early.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.124
<i>I had a dream about you.</i>

51:03.200 --> 51:05.567
Really?

51:05.640 --> 51:08.166
We were
in high school together.

51:08.240 --> 51:12.370
But we looked the same.
Middle-aged high-schoolers.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.490
<i>I was asking you to the prom or</i>
something, I don't remember exactly.

51:16.560 --> 51:20.804
You were nervous and blushing,

51:20.880 --> 51:23.281
and I gave you
one hell of a kiss.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.884
Did we go to prom together?

51:27.960 --> 51:31.123
I don't know.
You sped off crying.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.407
That sounds about right.

51:36.640 --> 51:40.361
Listen, what would you think about coming
down here for a few days to visit?

51:40.440 --> 51:43.091
Come on.
Shoes off, please.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.168
I want my damned pancakes.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.971
Watch your mouth.
Yeah, shut up, Robbie.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.730
How about this weekend?

51:50.480 --> 51:52.561
This weekend?

51:52.600 --> 51:53.919
This weekend's good.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.730
Okay, I got to run.
I will call you later.

51:56.840 --> 51:59.205
Okay.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.564
Colin!

52:17.200 --> 52:19.123
Colin!

52:19.200 --> 52:22.841
At 7:00 a.m. I get a call
from Gail Dixon with the GCCF.

52:22.880 --> 52:24.399
She's in Feinberg's office.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.961
She tells me BP admires the
work the foundation is doing

52:28.080 --> 52:31.163
and has decided to give us
a $3.5 million grant.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.084
Three million
for existing clients' claims,

52:34.160 --> 52:36.288
and the remainder
for their bankruptcy needs.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.687
This right here is too good to be true.
That's what I thought.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.239
So I get to the office,

52:46.240 --> 52:48.208
I log into
the donation account,

52:48.240 --> 52:51.961
and the money is there. The
numbers match up. But why us?

52:52.040 --> 52:54.520
There's got to be ten other
organizations just like ours.

52:54.600 --> 52:56.887
Publicity? Exactly.
So if you're BP,

52:56.960 --> 52:59.406
why associate yourself
with a disgraced politician?

52:59.480 --> 53:00.919
Muddles the story.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.684
But this barely
touches on the scandal.

53:06.960 --> 53:08.610
Do you want
to send back the money?

53:09.600 --> 53:11.840
Hell, no.

54:16.720 --> 54:19.121
I poked around
with a BP publicist.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.725
She didn't know
who authorized the grant,

54:20.800 --> 54:23.883
but she thought it would ignite a
wave of funding, which makes sense.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.645
I mean, the GCCF's been hit
with a ton of criticism.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.688
Yeah, okay.
Then why start with me?

54:28.760 --> 54:31.604
Who knows? Who cares?
Just be thankful.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.160
This is a blessing for your
foundation and your image.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.004
And I know the press
have taken their shots,

54:36.080 --> 54:38.970
but you are coming off
of this a winner.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.530
All right, enough about work.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.959
So, what's the plan?

54:45.960 --> 54:47.644
Are you hungry?

54:47.760 --> 54:50.331
Client of mine's having
a barbecue in Grand Isle.

54:50.400 --> 54:53.244
The fishing village?
Yeah, the fishing village.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.845
Who do you think
my clients are?

55:26.520 --> 55:29.444
Only kind of seafood
won't kill you these days.

55:29.520 --> 55:32.000
You got your potatos,
you got your corns,

55:32.080 --> 55:33.809
little bit of crab oil,
some garlic,

55:33.880 --> 55:35.689
then you got your Cajun spices,

55:35.760 --> 55:38.809
and God help you if you
get this in your eyeball.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.479
And once you get it
smoking real good,

55:40.480 --> 55:42.039
then you know
you got yourself a boil.

55:42.040 --> 55:44.008
You married
quite the chef, huh?

55:44.080 --> 55:46.651
No, there ain't a man in Louisiana
don't know how to cook.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.724
Oh, she got a mouth on her.
What? It's true.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.325
Y'all want a beer?

55:51.400 --> 55:53.479
You have a soda or something?

55:53.480 --> 55:55.482
What, you don't drink?
Trying not to.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.210
Oh. Me, too.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.719
Can I tell you something?

56:01.720 --> 56:02.999
Sure.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.765
I think you got a bum deal.
Lay...

56:05.880 --> 56:08.087
I mean, you got that
son of a bitch Senator Owens

56:08.160 --> 56:10.731
sleeping with hookers.
He keeps getting elected.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.485
You, you cheated on your wife.
Big fucking deal.

56:13.560 --> 56:16.291
I mean, people are broke,
sick with the dispersants,

56:16.360 --> 56:19.284
you're the only one down here
doing a goddamn thing for us.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.610
Can I help you
with those drinks?

56:23.680 --> 56:26.170
Sure.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.764
That lady of yours,
she's something else.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.446
No, no. We just
work together, Hal.

56:36.800 --> 56:39.531
I heard you was
rattling cages over at BP.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.523
Looks like we're in business.

56:41.600 --> 56:46.208
I think more like
we ain't out of business yet.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.244
You done good, Congressman.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.528
<i>In beaking</i>
news, yet another scandal

57:59.600 --> 58:02.080
<i>is sending shockwaves</i>
through our nation's capital.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.731
<i>This one involving two-term</i>
Republican Senator Tom Owens

58:04.800 --> 58:08.088
<i>of Louisiana who was detained</i>
by federal agents late last night.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.686
<i>On Saturday morning</i>
FBI agents raided

58:10.760 --> 58:13.411
<i>Senator Owens' Washington, D.C.</i>
And Metairie homes

58:13.480 --> 58:15.369
<i>as part of an ongoing</i>
corruption probe.

58:15.400 --> 58:18.688
<i>Sources familiar with</i>
the investigation said investigators

58:18.760 --> 58:21.161
<i>are looking into whether Owens</i>
used his influence... Yeah?

58:21.240 --> 58:23.561
<i>In various business dealings.</i>

58:23.640 --> 58:26.086
<i>Who'? No formal charges</i>
have been filed against me.

58:26.160 --> 58:29.209
<i>We don't know the extent or the</i>
precise nature of this investigation,

58:29.240 --> 58:31.766
<i>but I am cooperating</i>
with the authorities fully and...

58:31.840 --> 58:33.888
3:00 p.m. Works.
Uh-huh.

58:37.200 --> 58:39.087
Who was that?

58:45.560 --> 58:47.960
Mark will just be a minute.
Can I get you something to drink?

58:48.000 --> 58:49.809
No, thanks, I'm fine.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.484
Hello.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.799
Sorry, honey.

58:59.800 --> 59:02.371
No, you cannot go
to the Kanye concert alone.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.681
Janie is not an adult.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.762
160,000 cash.
That's what the Feds

59:06.840 --> 59:09.491
found in the attic
of Owens' Georgetown home.

59:09.560 --> 59:12.291
Your stepfather can take you.

59:12.400 --> 59:16.166
He's cool.
He's hip.

59:16.280 --> 59:19.523
Okay, pumpkin.
All right, love you.

59:19.600 --> 59:23.207
My daughter is 14.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.248
What else do you know
about Tom Owens?

59:25.320 --> 59:29.166
I know that he took a bribe
from a Florida businessman.

59:29.240 --> 59:31.402
Tom's going to resign?
No.

59:31.480 --> 59:34.290
The investigation could take 18
months, and if Owens decides

59:34.360 --> 59:37.489
to fight, which he will,
a conviction could take years.

59:37.560 --> 59:41.849
What's the problem, then? Tom may not be in
the party, but he supports your interests.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.321
It's not Owens
I'm worried about.

59:46.720 --> 59:48.802
It's Chris Wilcox.

59:48.880 --> 59:51.166
He's going to beat him.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.601
You know I can't win.
Really?

59:56.680 --> 59:58.603
Well, our polls
are telling us differently.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.446
Seems the public would be
receptive to your running.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.206
You just need the right spin
and a machine to spin it.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.849
You authorized that grant.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.611
Being one of BP's most influential
shareholders has its perks.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.002
So you had them donate
$3.5 million into my foundation

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.650
to test the waters
for a Senate run?

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.324
What's it to them?

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.846
Who's going
to finance the campaign? BP?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.685
No. I am.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.210
We need someone from Louisiana
fighting for our side.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.169
And you think it makes
a hell of a story,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.164
Colin Pryce, working to bridge
the gap between BP

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.089
and all the hardworking folks
of Louisiana.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.845
This goes way beyond BP.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.321
This is about
the entire industry.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.562
This is about
protecting investments.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.008
The next few years,
every major oil and gas company

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.606
will be spending
more and more token money

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.162
on alternative energy
and safe drilling.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.121
Billions of ad dollars will be
spent to cleanse their images.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.363
And we'll make sure that
you're in the center of it all.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.519
A hero.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.161
But you're not just asking me
to change my energy position.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.846
You're asking me to turn my
back on the claims process.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.199
Look at it this way,

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.886
if it's not you,
we'll find someone else.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.922
Chris Wilcox
is not going to win.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.439
You can bet on that.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.488
What makes you think
I'd do this?

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.644
You're standing here.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.602
You want to know
how I rationalize it?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.091
I ask myself,
would I rather that claims money

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.925
be in the hands of a bunch
of podunk fishermen

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.048
or invested back
into the economy

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.205
by a corporation who's been creating
jobs down here since before I was born.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.203
As for a moratorium,

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.124
that is just not
economically sound for anyone.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.248
Thank you for your time.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.608
You know what I always found most
interesting about politicians

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.967
is that they're so blinded
by delusions of grandeur

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.963
that they forget
who they really are.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.801
In your case, the only thing anyone
is going to remember about you

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.565
is that you fucked
a fisherman's wife.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.167
Most people
won't even remember that.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.049
You're going to need
someone like me, Colin.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.724
I know.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.804
I know what you're thinking.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.081
It's really not my place.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.603
I'm not going
to work with him, Kate.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.479
Then why take the meeting?

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.847
Because I at least needed to...

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.685
Hear him out? Why?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.762
Even if I never resigned, I still
wouldn't have won that Senate seat.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.763
They were always
maneuvering me.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.359
I was in denial.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.203
That's not true.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.049
You stand for something.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.163
Will you stay
for a couple more days?

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.844
I wish I could.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.002
But unfortunately
I have work and...

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.970
children. So...

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.965
Well, what would you think about me
coming up there to visit you soon?

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.804
I could spend time
with your kids.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.008
I'm not divorced yet, Colin.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.447
And neither are you.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.488
You know damn well
it's right with us.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.003
What about your career?

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.366
Do you have any idea
what this would look like?

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.250
We've already been
incredibly reckless.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.769
This feels real to me.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.850
And if it means
I can't run for office again,

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.729
so be it.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.320
I thought I was taking you
to the airport.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.999
I called a cab.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.968
I figured I'd let you sleep.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.721
Folks, the grant was given to us
for claims we already submitted.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.164
Are any of you
existing clients?

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.005
Meaning people
we worked with in the past?

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.208
All right, who's next?

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.481
We had to treat
your father's alcohol withdrawal

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.046
to maximize the safety
of his surgery.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.639
Detox.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.449
Detox was kind
of rocky for him.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.841
Both emotionally
and physically.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.049
We're going to take him
into the OR about 40 minutes.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.966
The surgery should take
five to seven hours.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.690
Take your time
with him until then.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.842
Thank you.
Yeah.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.801
Heard you were in the middle
of a class action.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.326
I didn't think you'd be here.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.767
I postponed the depositions,
but I have to get back

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.729
to the office during surgery.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.209
He's my father, too.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.130
<i>I'll</i> be outside.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.404
How are you feeling?

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.167
Ask me that in seven hours.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.525
You're going to be okay.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.361
You know, I was thinking
about something on the ride over.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.728
You remember that speech you
gave during the '69 campaign

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.361
about the anti-discrimination
ordinance, you remember?

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.841
You were shouting,
pounding your fist,

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.570
spitting like a mad dog.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:09.046
I was too young to understand
much of what you were saying,

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.523
but I did understand
it was about race.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.568
Blacks and whites,
right and wrong.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.520
And I never...
Do...

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.604
Do me a favor, Colin.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.808
What?

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.281
Don't feel sorry for me.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.008
Oh, Christ.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.651
All right.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.886
Close the damn shades.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.087
The sun is hurting my eyes.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.526
You've been sleeping
with your consultant.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.930
That's none of your business.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.401
Another disaster
waiting to happen.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:42.801
What does it matter
to you anyway?

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.326
It's difficult to stop
caring about someone

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:48.051
you've spent 25 years
of your life with.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.399
But you did.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.529
I apologize.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.128
I'm willing to admit that...

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.886
I've been wrong.
And I'm sorry.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.729
What are you talking about?

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.890
I don't want to sign.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.403
If you fall on one issue,

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.839
you make that sacrifice,

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.684
we can accomplish
everything we've worked for.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.881
You won't be able
to make this on your own terms.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.999
Not this time.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.287
500,000.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.603
That's how many people
have filed with the GCCF.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.523
I'd be responsible
for all of them.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.331
It won't change a thing,
and you know it.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.765
Why are you doing this?

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.086
I love you.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.640
Whether you take
the deal or not.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.201
Do me a favor.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.806
Don't come back here
after the surgery.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.881
<i>You've reached Kate Haber,</i>
you can leave me a message...

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.930
<i>City and state, please.</i>

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.765
Arlington, Virginia.
Katherine Haber.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.239
Hello?

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.651
<i>Kate.</i>

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.608
Why are you
calling me at home?

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.047
Can we talk for a minute?

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.329
This isn't a good time.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.051
Just call the office tomorrow
and we can talk then.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.159
I miss you.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.640
Honey, we're starting
the movie.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.520
Can...
I just need a minute.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.966
I'll just be a minute.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.446
That was your husband.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.931
We've decided to try
and work things out.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.924
Were you going
to bother telling me?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.651
<i>Yes, of course I was.</i>

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.042
But it just happened and...

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.571
I...

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.250
I don't know.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.926
But what did you think
was going to happen?

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.808
<i>That I'd campaign with you?</i>

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.927
That I'd stand up there
on that podium by your side?

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.801
You weren't giving up politics
to be with me.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.360
And if you did,
you would have been miserable.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.206
<i>You would have resented me.</i>

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.001
<i>Maybe not at first,</i>
but what about in six months?

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.570
<i>OF a year?</i>

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.442
Do you love him?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.731
<i>Oh, Colin,</i>
tell me that I'm wrong.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.727
Tell me that I'm wrong.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.567
I'm sorry to have
called so late.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.649
You have a good night.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.642
<i>Colin?</i>

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.087
<i>Colin, open the door.</i>

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.085
<i>Colin. Colin.</i>

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.924
<i>Open the door.</i>

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.410
<i>Unlock the door.</i>

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.928
<i>Colin.</i>

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.804
<i>You've always</i>
been a decent man, Colin.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.646
<i>But that's</i>
not why I married you.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.805
<i>I married you because I knew</i>
you had it in you to be a great man.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.602
<i>And great men,</i>

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:10.006
<i>men who build legacies,</i>
they aren't always decent.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.924
<i>They understand that people...</i>

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.890
<i>they need someone</i>
to tell them what to remember.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.361
<i>And what to forget.</i>

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.123
<i>They need great men</i>
to insulate them from frailty.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:28.683
<i>What's good, what's bad.</i>

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:35.928
<i>Because only great men know how to make</i>
people 's powerlessness tolerable.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.771
<i>My mother grew up a couple</i>
miles east of here in Metairie.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.763
<i>My father grew up in the city.</i>

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.650
<i>I was raised in Broadmoor.</i>
Graduated Jesuit High.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.282
My parents had friends
who worked at this plant.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.408
I had friends whose parents
worked at this plant.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.721
And I have friends now
who work at this plant,

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.962
some of you are here today.

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.681
Sol understand
the problems that we face.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.411
I understand our frustrations.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.443
<i>And I am here</i>
to be the solution.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.325
We must not let ourselves forget
the 11 men who died

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.289
on that Transocean rig

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.728
<i>or the impact the spill</i>
has had on the Gulf Coast.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:58.601
But we also can't allow tragedy
to force us into making foolish decisions.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.763
Instead of wasting our energy
vilifying the oil industry

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.605
and the GCCF,
we need to be patient.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.286
We need to work together.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.569
Because the fact
of the matter is,

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.085
we need each other.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.407
Good legislating
is the art of compromise.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.131
Good business
is the art of compromise.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:58.410
Life will forever be
the art of compromise.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.962
Chris Wilcox doesn't understand
that around here people go

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.728
from seafood to oil field
and from oil field to seafood.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.883
He doesn't understand that
a permanent ban on drilling

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.042
will devastate
our local economy.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.329
He doesn't understand that
you cannot afford to send

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.051
hard-earned American dollars
to the Middle East.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.170
I am running for Senate
to move things forward,

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.323
not only for this
great state of Louisiana,

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.165
but for this great country.
