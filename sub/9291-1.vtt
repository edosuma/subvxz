02:05.480 --> 02:07.880
" I can't reach her!

02:07.960 --> 02:10.400
Please help me.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.760
I can't move.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.280
" There's two more
trapped inside that one.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.960
Help me. I... I can't move. Oh, my God.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.480
Sarah, save what you're doing. I need you.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.400
- What is it?
- I just heard from one of our sources.

03:28.480 --> 03:34.480
There's a probability that someone from our
FBI watch list was spotted in LA yesterday.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.160
- Tomas Sherek. Who is he?
- He's worked with terror cells near Istanbul.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.440
He's suspected of coordinating
suicide bombings last summer.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.760
Istanbul?

03:45.840 --> 03:50.160
There was some chatter this morning about
a possible attack by a group out of Turkey.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.760
Here it is. From Ankara.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.200
- What was the target?
- East Coast. New York or DC.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.280
- But the time window passed.
- Passed?

03:58.360 --> 04:03.240
The targeted time is for 8am.
It's already past ten on the East Coast.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.600
What if they got the target wrong
and it's West Coast time?

04:06.680 --> 04:09.840
Then it's gonna go down within the hour.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.120
- Tell Curtis. I'll take this to Driscoll.
- I can take it.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.640
- Why?
- I thought you wanted to keep working it up.

04:18.720 --> 04:24.320
You're really transparent. Stop trying
to be Driscoll's pet. She doesn't like it.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.320
Any voice confirmation
from anyone on the train?

04:29.400 --> 04:32.000
No. The signals just confirmed a bomb.

04:32.080 --> 04:36.640
We're trying to get in contact. It's in a remote
area, but local police are heading there.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.440
All right.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.160
We have discretionary authority
out of Point Mugu.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.800
Have them direct a patrol aircraft over the
area. Put the pilot in contact with our people.

04:45.880 --> 04:51.600
- "Should we monitor emergency services?"
- No. County will cover that.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.160
A truck full of C-4
derailed a train in Santa Clarita.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.880
Free up some people.
Division's gonna send data.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.960
- That could be related to what we found.
- What did you find?

05:02.040 --> 05:06.960
Two things. First, intelligence indicated the
possibility of an attack at eight this morning.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.800
Bombing was at seven. That's within an hour.
What's the second thing?

05:10.880 --> 05:16.480
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list,
Tomas Sherek, was last seen in the city.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.680
- He could be related to the bombing.
- OK. Open up channels with Division.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.320
Start investigating this bombing.
Work up what you have on Sherek.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.720
We'll brief in a few minutes.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.640
What about the Defense Department meeting?
It's in a half hour.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.760
Who's Secretary Heller sending?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.040
Jack Bauer.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.280
Jack? Are you sure?

05:37.360 --> 05:41.960
Yeah. He hasn't been back...
well, since you fired him.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.760
- Is it gonna be uncomfortable?
- What?

05:56.760 --> 05:59.800
Going back to CTU. Seeing Driscoll again.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.120
I don't blame her for her decision.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.720
How can that be? She forced you out of CTU.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.720
She didn't want an ex-junkie.
That's not unreasonable.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.120
You weren't a junkie.
You were doing your job.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.600
I was addicted to heroin.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.120
It didn't matter why.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.040
Do you miss your old job?

06:20.120 --> 06:24.400
I could have joined other agencies
if I still wanted to do field work.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.520
But I didn't.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.600
I wanted something different from my life.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.800
It might not seem like a lot to you.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
But for me...

07:04.720 --> 07:08.120
To be able to have this
kind of a connection with someone...

07:08.200 --> 07:10.800
I couldn't do that before.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.280
I'm glad you can now.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.080
- We'd better go.
- Yeah.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.080
Secretary Heller's gonna be
in the lobby in five minutes.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.800
- Secretary Heller?
- Yeah.

07:31.880 --> 07:36.880
I called him Dad once in a press conference
so I decided then to use his title all the time.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.440
Audrey...

07:39.520 --> 07:42.480
Your father's a very perceptive man.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.160
I would like to tell him about us
before he finds out on his own.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.040
Look...

07:49.040 --> 07:51.600
My dad is kind of old-fashioned.

07:51.680 --> 07:56.080
Even though Paul and I are separated,
he still considers us married.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.080
I understand that. And I don't want
your father to draw the wrong conclusion

08:00.160 --> 08:03.160
and think that I had
anything to do with the break-up.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.200
Yeah, but you didn't.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.520
Please, Jack.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.160
Let's just give it a little more time.

08:12.160 --> 08:16.120
I'm gonna tell you something
and I don't want you to panic.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.560
I'm falling in love with you.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.960
Look, I don't want you to say anything.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.680
And I don't need you to feel the same way.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.400
I just wanted you to know.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.360
- I will see you downstairs.
- Yeah.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.640
All right. This is what we have.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.920
A known terrorist named Tomas Sherek
managed to enter the country undetected.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.440
There's a likelihood Sherek
helped organise the train attack.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.600
If he did, he's gonna get
out of the country as fast as he can.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.920
Which means we have
a small window of opportunity here.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.240
Who's covering airports and customs?

09:20.320 --> 09:23.680
I am. I've issued a mandate
to LAX, Long Beach and Ontario.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.720
As usual, Edgar, we can't hear you.
Where's your laptop if you need to pull data?

09:27.800 --> 09:33.040
Sorry, I'll speak up. And I don't need
my laptop. I have everything memorised.

09:33.120 --> 09:37.120
What I was saying is that I've asked
all the airports to add a layer of security.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.400
- Any local contacts for Sherek?
- I'm looking into those now.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.320
All right. Promote everything
we receive up to Division.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.880
Let's find Sherek
before he leaves the city. Let's go.

09:50.200 --> 09:54.400
Excuse me. Do you think it's a mistake
to assume Sherek is on his way out of LA?

09:54.480 --> 09:57.680
- No.
- But the timing on the intel doesn't match.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.120
It said 8am and the train bombing
happened around seven.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.520
Just focus on finding Sherek.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.920
- " Yes."
- It's Tomas.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.560
- "Did Dar get the briefcase?"
- Yes. He's on his way to you now.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.320
Good. You did well, Tomas.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.080
- What about Maurice?
- "He's waiting for you."

10:20.160 --> 10:22.760
He has everything you need.

10:30.200 --> 10:35.080
- Behrooz, are you eating with us?
- I'll be right down, Mom.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.720
- I'm concerned about him.
- Concerned? Why?

10:44.800 --> 10:49.440
- I think he's still seeing this American girl.
- You said you'd talk to him.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.120
I did. I told him he was no longer
allowed to have contact with her.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.240
And he agreed, right?

10:56.320 --> 10:57.880
Yes.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.680
But I think he's still seeing her
behind our backs.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.440
- I'll speak to him.
- No.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.120
I'll take care of it.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.960
Behrooz, we're sitting down to eat.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.400
- Behrooz.
- I'm on the phone.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.880
Get off and come down now.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.600
- Who is he talking to?
- I don't know.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.560
Sorry.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.880
- Who were you on the phone with?
- My friend Scott.

11:40.960 --> 11:45.360
- You were talking to that American girl.
- No, I told you, I don't see her any more.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.640
Don't lie to me, Behrooz!

11:47.720 --> 11:50.520
I hear your phone calls at night.
I read your emails.

11:50.600 --> 11:56.080
- You read my emails? That's my business!
- Don't you raise your voice to your father.

11:56.160 --> 12:01.080
While you live under my roof,
there is no such thing as your business.

12:01.160 --> 12:05.800
No more communications with that girl.
Do you understand me?

12:06.320 --> 12:09.760
Don't look at her. You're talking to me.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.960
Yes, sir.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.080
... where a horrible tragedy
struck a short time ago.

12:15.160 --> 12:20.200
An early morning commuter train collided with
a truck that was apparently crossing the track.

12:20.280 --> 12:24.200
Reports are coming in that most
of the passengers were severely injured.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.440
Casualty estimates as high as 30.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.680
NTSB agents have arrived on the scene
and are investigating the cause.

12:30.760 --> 12:34.160
At this time, the authorities
are not saying if this was an accident

12:34.240 --> 12:39.040
or a targeted attack,
but, as you can see, there has been...

12:39.120 --> 12:41.920
So far, everything is on schedule.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.360
- Have you spoken to Tomas?
- Yes.

12:44.440 --> 12:49.320
The briefcase is on its way to us now. When it
gets here, you'll take it to the warehouse.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.600
Why doesn't Dar take it there directly?

12:51.680 --> 12:57.480
He doesn't need to know where our people
are working. That's the safest way.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.160
Behrooz...

13:00.240 --> 13:04.400
If your father seems severe,
it's because our job here is a difficult one.

13:04.480 --> 13:09.040
If we are to succeed,
it's important that we are of a single mind.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.800
I understand.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.360
What we will accomplish today
will change the world.

13:19.440 --> 13:24.680
We're fortunate that our family
has been chosen to do this.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.800
We cannot fail.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.880
Yes, Father.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.680
Morning, Jennifer.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.800
- What are you doing here so early?
- I'm not here early.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.800
- You've been here all night?
- Yeah.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.080
- What are you working on?
- Nothing right now.

14:12.160 --> 14:16.080
I'm just stealing some software
from Adobe and Microsoft.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.680
You're gonna get caught one of these days.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.480
Hey, Melanie.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.560
Don't tell anybody or I'll have to kill you.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.000
What the hell is this?

14:44.360 --> 14:45.560
Whoa.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.240
Melanie, come look at this.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.280
Looks like someone's
trying to corrupt the Internet.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.160
Yeah, but it hasn't started propagating yet.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.560
They're just placing the nodes.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.800
Look at this.

15:04.880 --> 15:09.400
- This could tank every system in the world.
- You've gotta tell somebody.

15:09.480 --> 15:14.000
If I call the feds from here, they'll trace
the call. They'll know I was stealing code.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.160
Then do it from a payphone.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.840
Yeah.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.720
I'm up to speed on the train bombing.
How many confirmed dead?

15:32.800 --> 15:35.040
- " 32.
- I didn't know that.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.760
- Call Carl.
- I will. Thanks, Al.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.160
- 32 dead.
- What's the initial assessment?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.240
An act of terrorism.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.720
When you get to CTU, I want you
to find out all the details and call me.

15:45.800 --> 15:51.480
And listen... I don't want anyone, except you
two, to know about this meeting with Richard.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.120
Of course.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.920
I tried to get a hold of you last night.
Where were you?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.240
- I had dinner with a friend.
- Anyone I know?

16:01.320 --> 16:02.760
No.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.520
- Jack.
- Sir.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.720
I'll call you when I get to CTU.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.640
Yeah, I'll get her. Hold on.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.400
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Edgar Stiles.

16:29.480 --> 16:33.480
You don't need to use your last name.
You've been here over a month. What is it?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.360
I got a friend of yours.
He says he needs to talk to you.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.440
- Who, Edgar?
- "His name is Andrew Paige."

16:38.520 --> 16:40.920
Fine. Put him through.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.160
- " Hello?"
- I can't take personal calls here.

16:44.240 --> 16:49.360
It's not personal. I found something
on the Net I think you should know about.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.960
There's a fake NAT table
and several large corporate routers.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.520
- It was loaded this morning.
- How would you know?

16:55.600 --> 16:58.720
I was trying to download some software
and I noticed it.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.560
By download, I assume you mean steal,
or you wouldn't have seen a NAT table.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.480
OK, fine.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.079
But I hacked deeper
and I found all kinds of stuff.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.200
What kind of stuff?

17:08.280 --> 17:10.040
I think someone's positioning code

17:10.119 --> 17:12.359
for a major Internet attack.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.319
The thing is, not all
the code remarks are in English.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.119
- What language were they in?
- "I don't know."

17:18.200 --> 17:23.240
It looked Middle Eastern.
Like Arabic or Turkish, maybe.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.359
- You find something?
- Sarah was working on Sherek's contacts.

17:27.440 --> 17:31.520
The system flagged Maurice Landstrass.
He owns a dry-cleaners in Studio City.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.840
We found his business is owned by a holding
company based out of Ankara, Turkey.

17:35.920 --> 17:41.600
All right. Give this to Ronnie, tell him
to get over there and see what he can find.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.280
- Excuse me, Miss Driscoll.
- What is it, Chloe?

17:44.360 --> 17:46.720
I just got a call from an old classmate.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.200
He noticed some high-profile
Internet nodes have been compromised.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.480
- This could be related to our present threat.
- Why?

17:53.560 --> 17:57.480
A computer network virus was launched
this morning from a server in Turkey.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.720
That's where Sherek is from.
Should I start working it up?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.200
No.

18:03.280 --> 18:09.280
The bombing and Sherek are all we should
be dealing with now. But pass it to the FBI.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.480
- Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?
- Yes, I have a meeting with Erin Driscoll.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.400
Jack. It's OK, Sarah. This is Jack Bauer.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.800
Oh. Mr Bauer. I'm sorry.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.840
No, it's fine.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.000
Chloe, how have you been?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.400
Not perfect, but ok.
How are Kim and Chase?

18:57.480 --> 19:01.680
Good. They just got a house in Valencia.
Kim's taking care of Angela.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.000
Chase works for a private security company.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.520
That's interesting... I mean, I'm interested,
I just have to set up a protocol.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.200
Yeah.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.520
- Jack.
- Curtis. Is Erin ready for our meeting?

19:17.600 --> 19:20.800
Almost, but I should tell you,
you'll probably get cut short.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.880
- The train bombing in Santa Clarita.
- Among other things.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.800
- What other things?
- I won't bore you with it.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.000
- We're out.
- OK, we'll have you on voice three, data four.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.400
- Ronnie, Jack Bauer. Jack, Ronnie Lobell.
- Nice to meet you.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.560
- Hey, Jack.
- Ronnie's got your old job, head of field ops.

19:36.640 --> 19:41.120
- Yeah, I know. How's it going?
- It's busy. It was nice meeting you.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.840
Would you rather reschedule this?

19:43.920 --> 19:46.320
That won't be necessary.
Erin will be free soon.

19:46.400 --> 19:50.480
Tell you what, why don't you
use this station to make any calls.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.440
- It won't be long.
- OK, thank you.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.800
I don't know, Max. Let me find out.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.280
It's a Vandenberg representative.
How long will they be pushed back?

20:23.360 --> 20:26.240
Don't change anything with Vandenberg.

20:26.320 --> 20:31.400
We'll stick to the original schedule.
OK, Max. Yep. We'll see you then.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.680
- Have you spoken with your brother?
- No.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.160
I don't think he knows I'm coming with you.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.560
It's probably best that he doesn't.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.720
All right. I'll stay in the car.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.640
Dad, if Richard goes to this protest
in Lockheed, it's not the end of the world.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.240
- It's not a page-one story.
- That's not the point.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.400
It's an embarrassment to me
and to the president.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.680
- What are you gonna say to him?
- I have no idea.

21:02.760 --> 21:06.600
What gets to me is he doesn't know
the first thing about the politics of this.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.560
- He's doing it to rebel against you.
- Since when am I the enemy? What did I do?

21:10.640 --> 21:16.200
Nothing. Richard's acting like a spoilt child.
He's gonna have to grow up someday.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.160
- Audrey Raines.
- " It's the president calling."

21:23.240 --> 21:25.320
It's the president's office.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.720
- Heller here.
- "Please hold for the president."

21:30.800 --> 21:33.200
- " James."
- Yes, Mr President.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.680
I'm thinking of raising the terror alert level.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.840
Because of the train bombing?

21:37.920 --> 21:41.200
No, not just that.
Langley's picked up some chatter.

21:41.280 --> 21:45.160
We have intel on watch-listed individuals
who've gotten into the country.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.920
My instinct is to wait
until the NTSB weighs in on the bombing.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.720
In the meantime,
we can increase our state of readiness.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.760
All right. I'll take that into consideration.

21:56.840 --> 22:00.680
I'm meeting with the secretary of state
and Director Shaye in a few minutes.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.600
- I'll see if they feel the same about it.
- Yes, Mr President.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.520
Thank you.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.960
- Hello, Erin.
- Hello, Jack.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.360
- I'm sorry Secretary Heller couldn't be here.
- It's just as well.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.240
I'm sure you were told
we have a protocol in progress.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.480
So why don't we just go down the items
and get it over with?

22:27.560 --> 22:30.160
That's fine with me.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.400
I'll be direct with you, Jack.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.320
- I didn't like the budget your boss proposed.
- What's the problem?

22:37.400 --> 22:42.560
Well, this Department of Defense is asking
for 85 per cent of all interagency monies,

22:42.640 --> 22:44.800
which leaves very little for CTU.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.920
If you want a bigger piece,
you're gonna have to justify it.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.760
I have a proposal for you.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.800
Satellite surveillance for harbour traffic?

22:58.880 --> 23:02.200
- Yes. Problem?
- Yes. It's insufficient.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.240
- You need to maintain bodies on the ground.
- Too expensive.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.000
Not if you utilise intelligence
from other agencies.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.560
I am not gonna have Secretary Heller sign off
on a budget that doesn't make sense.

23:12.640 --> 23:17.560
- I'll talk to Heller about it myself.
- No, you'll talk to me.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.360
We're not doing this twice.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.240
- " Erin, Ronnie's arrived at Landstrass'."
- Where's the feed?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.080
On channel one,
as soon as he sets the hidden camera.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.160
Excuse me, Jack.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.480
OK, here we go.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.480
Stand down until I give the order.
Aaron, go around the back.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.360
Sean, you're gonna take the side.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.120
Hello?

24:06.040 --> 24:09.000
- "Can I help you?"
- "Are you Mr Landstrass?"

24:09.080 --> 24:12.520
- Do I know you?
- Ronnie Lobell. I'm with Los Angeles CTU.

24:12.600 --> 24:17.680
I need to ask you a few questions. What do
you know about a man named Tomas Sherek?

24:17.760 --> 24:20.040
I don't know this name.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.080
We have records of you
contacting him in the last two days.

24:24.160 --> 24:29.800
- "Wasn't me. I run a legitimate business here."
- "I never said your business wasn't legitimate."

24:29.880 --> 24:33.320
Look, you just can't
walk in here and harass me.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.760
- He's hiding something.
- It's being handled, Jack.

24:36.840 --> 24:42.040
Listen to me. His store's open, but the blinds
are closed. There's no other employees.

24:42.120 --> 24:47.080
This guy is way too nervous.
Trust me, he's hiding something.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.720
Ronnie, turn your back
on Landstrass for a moment, please.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.480
It says you open at 6am.
Have you been here the entire time?

24:59.560 --> 25:02.200
Yes. What's this about?

25:02.280 --> 25:04.840
Right there.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.720
Do you see that?
Tell him to look for something on his right.

25:15.800 --> 25:21.160
Ronnie, on Landstrass' right,
see if there's any place Sherek can be hiding.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.880
- Do you mind if I look behind that counter?
- Yes, I do.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.080
Look, this is my store
and I want you to walk out now.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.400
I'm not walking out until I look around.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.920
- Back door!
- On the ground!

25:37.680 --> 25:40.080
He's headed back to you!

25:44.840 --> 25:47.560
It's Sherek. We've got him.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.040
Great job.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.800
Remember, Dad,
we're on a tight schedule today.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.960
Richard.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.200
Dad.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.080
- Hello.
- " Hey, it's me.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.720
- "Aren't you supposed to be with Driscoll?"
- Yeah, she had to step away.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.480
CTU has just picked up a prime suspect in the
train bombing. They're bringing him in now.

27:01.560 --> 27:06.040
- My father's still in with Richard.
- I'll brief him later. I wanted to let you know.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.640
- All right. That's good news.
- Yeah. I think so.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.440
All right.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.240
- I'll talk to you later.
- Wait, wait.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.080
- What is it?
- Look...

27:18.160 --> 27:22.520
About earlier... I don't want you
to think that that made me uncomfortable.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.390
It's just, since Teri
died, I never thought I'd...

27:25.511 --> 27:26.880
Jack, it's all right.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.040
- I understand.
- No. No, you don't.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.840
I just want you to know that...

27:36.320 --> 27:39.320
I'm falling in love with you, too.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.880
Wow.

27:43.880 --> 27:48.560
- You caught me off guard.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.040
- Driscoll's coming back. I gotta go.
- Then go.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.600
- OK. I'll talk to you when I get a break.
- All right.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.080
- What's happening with the suspect?
- Ronnie's bringing him in.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.680
- Who is he?
- Fortunately for you, Jack,

28:06.760 --> 28:08.720
it's our problem, not yours.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.800
Right.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.160
I'm going, Dad.
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.680
How many cars do you need to get places?

28:19.760 --> 28:22.400
I didn't come here
to argue about the environment.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.720
I didn't ask you to come at all.

28:27.360 --> 28:32.920
I do not want you to attend or to speak
at that rally at Lockheed this afternoon.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.960
You don't have leverage over what I do.
Not since I stopped taking your money.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.480
Can't you think of anything besides yourself?

28:39.560 --> 28:44.920
If you do this, it will humiliate the president,
and it will be dangerous to national security.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.880
What could be more dangerous
than 2500 missile delivery systems?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.960
Spare me your sixth-grade
Michael Moore logic.

28:53.040 --> 28:57.800
The world is a little bit more complicated
than that, Richard. We do not live in a utopia.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.000
America has enemies.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.880
Enemies who were our friends a year ago,
and in another year, it'll change again,

29:04.960 --> 29:08.640
unless people stop supporting your
psychotic need to control the world.

29:08.720 --> 29:12.400
Psychotic need? We serve our country!

29:12.480 --> 29:15.600
We serve the cause of freedom.
What do you do?

29:17.480 --> 29:21.040
Why don't you just go back
to your little motorcade and drive somewhere

29:21.120 --> 29:23.840
where people actually buy
the lies you're selling.

29:23.920 --> 29:28.400
OK, look. We don't have to do this, OK?
We do not have to.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.520
Fine, Dad. What do you wanna do?

29:34.000 --> 29:37.600
Do not disrespect me. I am your father!

30:05.040 --> 30:08.560
" Nothing. It was my friend, not me.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.040
- " What's his name?
- Andrew.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.200
- Andrew what?
- Andrew Paige.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.400
- Who did you tell?
- I swear, we didn't tell anyone. I don't know.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.200
- Don't lie to me.
- He just stumbled on the site and logged out.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.920
Don't lie to me!

30:27.480 --> 30:30.080
Where is Andrew Paige now?

30:32.520 --> 30:35.680
I was just doing my work. I don't...

31:27.760 --> 31:31.720
Use station five. Chloe's opened up a socket.
You can access the records volumes

31:31.800 --> 31:35.400
- to look at those budget numbers.
- OK, fine.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.400
- I know this guy.
- Sherek?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.800
When I was here, we knew him as Jann Bolek.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.600
We linked him to over a dozen bombings
in Europe in the late '90s.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.240
We weren't able to stop him
from today's attack, but we did catch him.

31:52.320 --> 31:57.760
Jack, I'm sorry I was abrupt before.
You helped us with the takedown. Thank you.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.920
Erin, listen to me.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.600
This doesn't make sense.
I know this guy's file, he's a major handler.

32:09.680 --> 32:15.240
He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the
US for a train bombing. It's not big enough.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.200
We'll consider that when we interrogate him.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.440
Give my best to Secretary Heller.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.000
- Chloe.
- What?

32:29.080 --> 32:33.520
The original data on Sherek - was there
any indication of a secondary strike?

32:33.600 --> 32:38.040
No. Everything supports that he was here for
the bombing. There was a time discrepancy.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.760
- What?
- There was some high-probability chatter

32:40.840 --> 32:43.720
indicating an attack at 8am.
The bombing was at seven.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.440
They didn't give a window?
It was for a specific time?

32:46.520 --> 32:51.280
Yeah, but the intel was off by an hour.
Driscoll thought it was close enough.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.960
- You can't do that.
- What's your logon for Interpol overnights?

32:55.040 --> 32:58.200
- I'm not comfortable doing this.
- Chloe, please.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.120
You're in.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.800
- Is this the source?
- Yes, that's the decipher.

33:19.160 --> 33:24.960
An 8am strike, unless target deviates. Trains
don't deviate. They're on a fixed course.

33:25.040 --> 33:30.600
Sometimes when Interpol's breaking codes in
communiques, it won't use the exact wording.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.760
What are you thinking, Jack?

33:32.840 --> 33:35.360
Sherek didn't come here for a train bombing.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.120
Something's gonna happen at eight o'clock.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.000
That's ten minutes from now.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
No, Paul. I don't wanna wait.

33:58.080 --> 34:02.200
I'm gonna call my lawyer when we get back
to DC. We're gonna get this divorce moving.

34:02.280 --> 34:06.680
- "We said take a year and see what happens."
- Yeah, but it's almost been a year.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.760
I don't wanna wait any longer.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.600
Hang on.

34:11.679 --> 34:15.760
Look, I gotta take this call. All right?
We'll talk when I get back to DC.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.560
- Yeah, fine.
- All right. Bye.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.679
- "Jack."
- Hey. I need to speak with your father.

34:22.760 --> 34:26.480
- He doesn't want to be interrupted.
- It's urgent. I need to get clearance

34:26.560 --> 34:30.679
so I can interrogate the suspect in
the bombing. Driscoll won't let me near him.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.880
I believe he's got information
on a secondary hit, a larger one.

34:33.960 --> 34:37.159
- It's supposed to take place at 8am.
- It's almost eight now.

34:37.239 --> 34:40.760
- I know. That's why I need to speak with him.
- All right. Hang on.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.960
I'm gonna speak at that rally
this afternoon, Dad.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.000
And it's not because I hate you.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.360
It's cos it's something I believe in.

34:56.440 --> 35:00.160
Did it ever occur to you
that these people are using you?

35:00.240 --> 35:04.480
Don't you realise they're letting you speak
for one reason and one reason only?

35:04.560 --> 35:08.000
Because you are my son!

35:08.800 --> 35:11.400
I wish I weren't.

35:17.720 --> 35:21.160
- What is it?
- I'm sorry. It's Jack. It's urgent.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.760
Excuse me, Richard.

35:22.840 --> 35:26.160
What could be more important
than intimidating me?

35:28.480 --> 35:30.680
I didn't know you were hiding in the car.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.640
Richie, why are you doing this to Dad?
Can't you back off?

35:33.720 --> 35:37.720
- I'm not doing anything to him.
- If you go to that protest, it's gonna hurt him.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.840
Whatever it takes to stop what he's doing.

35:41.920 --> 35:46.840
Jack, if I step on Driscoll's toes and it doesn't
pay off, I'll have political fallout to deal with.

35:46.920 --> 35:52.480
I understand, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't
believe there was a threat to national security.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.840
Share your concerns with Driscoll.
Let CTU handle it.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.920
- Sir, there isn't time.
- It's the president.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.200
Jack, it's the president.
I gotta go. I'll see you at Vandenberg.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.080
Yes, sir.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.520
How long have you been in Los Angeles?

36:34.600 --> 36:37.200
Who are you working with?

36:39.080 --> 36:41.440
We don't have time for this.
Listen to me.

36:41.520 --> 36:47.120
Unless you start giving me answers, you're
gonna end up in a hole for the next 30 years.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.800
Who are you working with?

36:51.440 --> 36:54.040
Why did you bomb that train?

37:12.480 --> 37:16.840
- How far can I push this guy?
- We have to find out who he's working with.

37:16.920 --> 37:20.920
We should go as far as we have to.
Maybe we should bring Johnson in.

37:24.120 --> 37:29.440
- Sorry, sir. This area's off limits.
- Oh, I'm looking for Erin Driscoll.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.440
Jack! Jack, what are you doing?
Call security now.

37:44.520 --> 37:48.000
- What is happening at eight?
- Son of a bitch. He's jammed the codes.

37:48.080 --> 37:52.840
I am not messing with you. You are gonna
tell me. What is happening at eight o'clock?

37:52.920 --> 37:55.520
Holster your weapon!

37:55.600 --> 37:59.000
Jack! I said holster your weapon.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.880
- Call medical.
- What is your primary objective?

38:02.960 --> 38:05.680
- I'll order security to shoot you!
- Get that door open!

38:05.760 --> 38:08.400
What is your primary objective?

38:08.480 --> 38:10.680
Secretary of Defense!

38:12.680 --> 38:14.240
Heller.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.080
- Secretary Heller?
- Yes.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.280
Secretary Heller's the target.
Call Secret Service now.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.560
- Call now! Get a team on the way.
- " Secret Service now.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.560
Yeah, I'll hold.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.480
The president wants us back in DC tonight.

38:29.560 --> 38:34.080
- What meetings can we eject?
- Not Vandenberg. The media's expecting you.

38:34.160 --> 38:39.760
Maybe we could skip Paradigm and handle
that with a teleconference next week.

38:40.240 --> 38:42.280
Come on, pick up the phone!

38:42.360 --> 38:45.960
Tell the president we'll rearrange
and fly back this afternoon.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.920
- Yeah.
- Audrey, it's Jack. Are you still at Richard's?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.280
- Yeah.
- Get your father out of there now!

38:51.360 --> 38:55.640
The bombing this morning was diversionary.
Your father is the real target. Get out!

38:55.720 --> 38:57.800
- Target?
- Audrey!

38:57.880 --> 39:00.120
Oh, my God.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.680
Audrey?

39:27.720 --> 39:30.560
- " On your feet!
- " On your feet!

39:30.640 --> 39:33.320
Jack! No! Jack!

39:33.400 --> 39:35.520
- Audrey!
- Jack! Jack!

39:38.440 --> 39:40.440
" Let her go!

39:41.400 --> 39:43.800
Let me go.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.960
Jack! Help!
