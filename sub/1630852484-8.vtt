Were you even there
for the gun deal at all,

40:39.829 --> 40:40.753
or were you lying
about that too?

40:40.830 --> 40:41.938
I was doing that.

40:42.015 --> 40:43.665
I didn't finish
setting things up out there

40:43.683 --> 40:44.924
because I came back for you.

40:45.001 --> 40:46.167
Don't sound so happy about it.

40:46.186 --> 40:49.261
All this time,
I've kept things sexy and fun,

40:49.281 --> 40:51.022
and you still had
to sneak around with her.

40:51.098 --> 40:53.341
-A cleaning lady of all people.
-Nadia, please--

40:53.359 --> 40:55.601
Do you know how embarrassing
it was to find that out

40:55.620 --> 40:57.512
from that sleazy FBI guy?

40:57.530 --> 40:58.955
-What? From who?
-Don't change the subject.

40:59.032 --> 41:00.348
It was humiliating.

41:00.366 --> 41:03.293
Look, Nadia.
Hey, listen to me.

41:03.369 --> 41:06.612
I only let Hayak think
I was having an affair

41:06.706 --> 41:08.539
to keep us from getting killed.

41:08.692 --> 41:10.133
It's not true, all right?

41:10.284 --> 41:12.210
Thony went with me to Mexico
'cause her son needed surgery.

41:12.362 --> 41:13.303
-That's it.
-Right.

41:13.530 --> 41:15.379
That's all this is about.

41:15.456 --> 41:17.724
I didn't sleep with her, Nadia.

41:19.385 --> 41:21.019
I swear to you.

41:24.632 --> 41:27.542
Even if you didn't,

41:27.544 --> 41:31.321
you've lied about her
over and over again.

41:31.397 --> 41:33.214
Why?

41:33.216 --> 41:36.384
This isn't about
helping her kid.

41:36.386 --> 41:38.219
You love the way
she looks at you

41:38.238 --> 41:40.497
when you do these things
for her.

41:40.573 --> 41:43.082
When you are her hero.

41:45.061 --> 41:46.127
Admit it.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.415
Nadia...

41:51.492 --> 41:52.759
Get out!

41:54.495 --> 41:55.637
Go.

41:56.998 --> 41:59.224
Go, and don't come back.

42:00.593 --> 42:03.061
(shouting in Spanish)

42:05.749 --> 42:08.691
(door clicks)

42:11.271 --> 42:13.512
(car alarm beeps, lock clicks)

42:13.590 --> 42:16.574
(phone buzzing)

42:18.261 --> 42:19.761
Thony, what is it?

42:19.854 --> 42:21.612
My FBI contact
went to Fiona's house

42:21.765 --> 42:23.281
looking for me.

42:23.283 --> 42:26.042
Do you think he knows
anything about Mexico?

42:26.193 --> 42:28.461
Yeah, he knows.

42:29.939 --> 42:32.674
(explosion)

42:35.962 --> 42:39.055
Arman? Arman.

42:40.466 --> 42:41.975
<i> Arman!</i>
