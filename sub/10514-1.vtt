03:19.350 --> 03:24.110
How was your day today?
How was it?

03:30.260 --> 03:35.130
Well then, shall we talk?

03:37.660 --> 03:40.220
First, tell me about yourself

03:43.370 --> 03:46.630
Who do you think you are?

03:57.180 --> 04:01.480
Do you know who this is?

04:11.030 --> 04:12.690
Don't know?

04:13.330 --> 04:15.490
It's your family

04:16.440 --> 04:18.600
Want to see it again?

04:23.340 --> 04:25.210
Fine then

04:29.750 --> 04:33.620
Can you tell me

04:33.750 --> 04:36.120
about that day?

04:39.660 --> 04:42.530
About what happened?

04:47.370 --> 04:50.630
You should be able
to remember it clearly

04:51.670 --> 04:56.130
It's okay

04:56.980 --> 04:58.880
From now on

04:59.010 --> 05:04.880
tell me what happened

06:58.860 --> 07:00.350
Aren't you getting out?

08:57.550 --> 08:59.140
Su-yeon

09:00.790 --> 09:02.450
Su-yeon!

09:55.440 --> 09:57.100
It's so pretty

10:29.880 --> 10:31.430
Give me your hand

10:34.880 --> 10:36.440
The other one

10:45.090 --> 10:46.650
Why?

10:57.100 --> 10:58.470
Su-mi!

12:00.630 --> 12:02.790
Welcome home!

12:02.940 --> 12:05.200
It's been such a long time

12:05.340 --> 12:07.100
You've changed
so much, Su-yeon

12:07.240 --> 12:09.300
You've gotten prettier...

12:09.540 --> 12:11.410
But you two
really disappointed me

12:11.540 --> 12:13.700
I waited all day for you two

12:13.850 --> 12:15.510
cooking and cleaning the house

12:15.650 --> 12:17.620
but why didn't
you say hi first?

12:17.750 --> 12:19.810
What did you do?

12:19.950 --> 12:21.720
Were you at the wharf?

12:22.550 --> 12:25.020
You should've changed first
before you went outside

12:25.160 --> 12:27.220
Anyway

12:28.260 --> 12:32.420
welcome back home

12:49.580 --> 12:51.850
Is something wrong?

12:53.690 --> 12:55.950
I see you've gotten better

12:56.290 --> 12:59.190
I'm so glad
you feel better now

13:00.830 --> 13:04.090
You're taking after your mom

13:07.930 --> 13:10.800
You're feeling
a lot better too, right?

13:11.740 --> 13:14.710
Right
I bet you're both tired

13:14.840 --> 13:18.000
Get some rest
and come down for dinner

13:18.140 --> 13:21.110
I'm preparing a
special dinner

13:21.250 --> 13:23.610
But, you should
give me some time

13:23.750 --> 13:26.810
There's a lot to prepare

16:40.750 --> 16:43.010
We just got back

16:44.050 --> 16:47.420
Things don't look
so good right now

16:48.450 --> 16:51.420
It wouldn't help much
if you came

16:52.660 --> 16:56.030
Yeah, I know

16:57.260 --> 17:01.260
Let's talk later
I should go

17:02.900 --> 17:06.060
So you're doing okay, right?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.670
Did I tell you?

17:08.910 --> 17:12.270
Sun-kyu and his wife
are coming over

17:14.010 --> 17:17.470
lt'll be alright
I'll take care of it

17:17.619 --> 17:19.780
Okay, bye

18:15.710 --> 18:16.770
Oh right!

18:17.010 --> 18:19.270
I invited Sun-kyu and his wife over

18:19.410 --> 18:21.680
for dinner this weekend

18:22.810 --> 18:23.870
Really?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.780
Lt'll be nice for them to
see the girls after so long

18:26.920 --> 18:29.280
And to catch up on things

18:36.130 --> 18:37.790
That was delicious

18:37.930 --> 18:40.800
Sorry, I have things to tend to

18:41.330 --> 18:44.600
You must be tired
so clean it up tomorrow

19:00.490 --> 19:03.250
Did you prepare
your father's undergarments?

19:04.290 --> 19:06.950
Thanks, but that's my job

19:07.090 --> 19:10.760
Cleaning my room is my job, too
Why'd you touch my stuff?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.460
That's how it was before

19:15.200 --> 19:19.260
So all of the same clothes
were hanging there before?

19:40.730 --> 19:42.490
I'm not having
dinner with him

19:42.630 --> 19:44.190
What?

19:45.130 --> 19:47.600
I said I'm not having
dinner with that guy

19:47.730 --> 19:51.100
He's not some guy
he's your uncle

19:53.840 --> 19:56.310
It's the first day
so let's give it a rest

20:09.550 --> 20:11.450
- And you?
- Yes?

20:12.660 --> 20:17.120
Aren't you going to follow her?
You're supposed to follow your sister

20:49.590 --> 20:51.960
What did that woman tell you?

20:54.700 --> 20:57.170
If she ever gets on your case
then tell me

20:57.700 --> 21:01.190
And don't ignore it like before
Okay?

21:09.850 --> 21:12.010
Good night

26:44.350 --> 26:46.110
What's wrong?

26:47.350 --> 26:49.320
Did you have a bad dream?

26:51.260 --> 26:53.520
Was it the closet?

26:55.860 --> 26:58.120
Then what's wrong?

26:59.400 --> 27:04.360
I keep hearing
strange noises outside

27:09.110 --> 27:11.670
It's because
you've been away too long

27:13.210 --> 27:16.870
It's okay
Let's sleep

27:17.020 --> 27:22.390
Somebody came into my room

28:50.940 --> 28:53.100
He's asleep

28:56.950 --> 28:59.750
- I know
- Then why are you trying to wake him?

29:00.890 --> 29:02.750
Says who?

29:04.790 --> 29:07.350
You were trying
to wake him just now

29:07.490 --> 29:09.360
Have something to tell him?

29:09.490 --> 29:12.050
It's none of your business

29:13.200 --> 29:15.670
All I'm saying is
since his fast asleep

29:15.800 --> 29:18.170
Don't wake him up
Don't you understand me?

29:18.300 --> 29:20.460
I just came down for water

29:22.210 --> 29:25.180
He's asleep so be quiet

30:50.290 --> 30:52.660
Did you go to my room?

30:53.700 --> 30:55.760
Yes

30:58.940 --> 31:01.200
Who was it?

31:02.940 --> 31:05.200
That woman

31:07.150 --> 31:09.410
Stepmom?

31:10.750 --> 31:12.610
Yeah

31:17.760 --> 31:22.820
It's strange

31:23.260 --> 31:25.420
What is?

31:27.870 --> 31:31.530
That woman is strange

31:32.970 --> 31:36.030
And so is this house

31:42.580 --> 31:45.050
Are you scared?

31:49.390 --> 31:54.150
Everything's alright
I'm here

31:54.990 --> 31:58.550
Come here
Let's sleep

32:06.740 --> 32:10.900
I'll always be with you

33:47.170 --> 33:48.930
Su-yeon Go away

37:23.620 --> 37:25.590
Are you awake?

37:26.420 --> 37:28.480
Yes

37:28.930 --> 37:32.190
- Can I come in?
- No

37:34.330 --> 37:36.990
Come down and eat

39:21.510 --> 39:23.560
What are you doing?

39:27.610 --> 39:29.880
Are you having your period?

39:33.620 --> 39:36.280
No, Su-yeon is...

39:36.420 --> 39:38.790
Su-yeon?

39:40.320 --> 39:42.490
That's so funny

39:47.330 --> 39:52.700
How could we both get our periods
on the same date?

40:22.570 --> 40:24.030
Su-mi...

40:24.170 --> 40:26.030
It's okay, come down

41:24.260 --> 41:26.630
That's mom's favorite, huh?

41:39.480 --> 41:42.040
Do it like this

41:46.380 --> 41:49.150
Shall we kill them?

41:49.290 --> 41:50.840
Let's set them free

41:54.790 --> 41:58.850
She'll have a cow
if we mess with her precious

41:59.130 --> 42:01.190
I'd hate to see that

42:09.940 --> 42:11.000
Su-mi

42:19.250 --> 42:21.720
What are you doing
out in the cold?

42:22.750 --> 42:24.620
Are you alright?

42:25.460 --> 42:26.920
Why?

42:27.060 --> 42:31.320
You don't look so good
Are you feeling sick?

42:31.760 --> 42:33.630
No, I'm okay

42:33.760 --> 42:35.930
Tell me what's wrong?

42:36.770 --> 42:39.240
I said I'm okay

42:44.070 --> 42:46.940
Just get rid of
Su-yeon's closet

42:48.380 --> 42:49.850
Su-mi

42:49.980 --> 42:53.440
we agreed not to talk about
that closet

42:55.190 --> 42:57.050
You promised, right?

43:01.530 --> 43:03.390
Su-mi

43:04.030 --> 43:08.400
I know you're
very angry with me

43:12.540 --> 43:15.330
And I know I'm a bad father

43:17.540 --> 43:19.980
You're not even a bad father

43:27.350 --> 43:29.510
It's cold so let's go inside

43:30.850 --> 43:33.020
I will

46:38.240 --> 46:39.800
What are you doing?

46:40.140 --> 46:42.410
You scared me

46:42.950 --> 46:45.010
When did you come in?

46:51.760 --> 46:54.520
- Did you go to the warehouse?
- Yeah

47:03.400 --> 47:06.160
Su-yeon, look at this

47:09.210 --> 47:10.870
Tada!

47:11.010 --> 47:12.470
Wow

47:12.610 --> 47:13.870
- Cool
- Pretty, huh?

47:14.010 --> 47:18.280
- Is it mom's?
- Yup, and...

47:18.420 --> 47:20.380
There's more

47:23.020 --> 47:25.680
It's mom!

47:28.830 --> 47:32.390
Taritakoom, taritakoom

47:32.530 --> 47:34.500
What does that mean?

47:34.630 --> 47:37.000
It's a spell to call mom

47:37.630 --> 47:39.400
Who told you that?

47:40.640 --> 47:43.900
- Mom did
- What?

47:44.040 --> 47:46.010
Can I take this?

47:46.140 --> 47:48.810
Huh? Sure...

47:53.350 --> 47:58.010
This... and this

47:58.160 --> 47:59.950
Wait!

48:02.190 --> 48:04.750
What is this?

48:12.500 --> 48:14.560
Who did this to you?

48:15.610 --> 48:18.570
Tell me, who did this?

48:18.710 --> 48:21.270
It's okay, tell me

48:22.610 --> 48:25.380
She did this, huh?

48:25.620 --> 48:27.980
She did this, didn't she?

48:28.620 --> 48:32.080
Su-yeon
what's wrong with you?

48:32.220 --> 48:34.690
I told you to
tell me everything!

48:34.830 --> 48:35.790
She did this, right?

48:35.930 --> 48:38.790
She did this, huh?
Did she do this?

48:38.930 --> 48:42.490
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

49:19.400 --> 49:21.170
What?

49:21.300 --> 49:23.770
How can you be so cruel?

49:24.910 --> 49:26.570
It's retribution

49:26.710 --> 49:29.870
If you disobey
you need to be punished

49:30.010 --> 49:32.680
Does dad know what you did?

49:33.720 --> 49:36.080
Think your father
can solve everything?

49:36.220 --> 49:39.280
Then go get him
Want me to do it?

49:39.920 --> 49:42.480
Sit down!
Where are your manners?

49:42.630 --> 49:44.090
Were you like this
to your mom, too?

49:44.230 --> 49:46.090
Don't bring up my mom!

49:47.130 --> 49:50.100
Listen carefully
I'm your mother, got it?

49:50.230 --> 49:51.790
As much as you hate it

49:51.940 --> 49:53.600
I'm the only one in this world

49:53.740 --> 49:56.400
you can call mother, got it?

49:56.540 --> 49:58.670
Crying over your mom's photos

49:58.780 --> 50:00.610
won't change anything

50:00.740 --> 50:02.800
Hard to handle, huh?
That's too bad

50:02.950 --> 50:04.810
But that's how the world is

50:04.950 --> 50:08.510
The world isn't as sweet
as you picture it

50:08.650 --> 50:10.920
Sometimes you have to bear the worst
and live on

50:11.050 --> 50:13.720
Like the way
I'm bearing you two!

50:14.360 --> 50:15.520
Tough isn't it?

50:15.660 --> 50:16.520
I have beared you two brats

50:16.660 --> 50:19.820
from the moment I came to this house

50:19.960 --> 50:21.230
I have never met such ill-mannered

50:21.360 --> 50:23.830
menaces like you two

50:32.980 --> 50:34.640
What?

50:36.480 --> 50:39.240
Why the hell did
you even come here?

50:42.990 --> 50:45.960
I can't believe you
said that to me again

50:46.790 --> 50:52.060
I see, you still must be sick

51:29.670 --> 51:31.330
Don't touch me

51:43.180 --> 51:45.240
- Let go!
- What's wrong with you?

51:45.380 --> 51:47.250
Are you that clueless?

51:47.380 --> 51:49.350
Don't touch me
with those filthy hands!

51:49.490 --> 51:51.040
Su-mi, listen to me

51:51.190 --> 51:53.250
I don't want to hear it
You're the same

51:53.390 --> 51:55.360
That's not true
you've misunderstood

51:55.490 --> 51:57.960
You're not even
accepting all this

51:58.090 --> 51:59.890
Why is it always me?

52:00.530 --> 52:03.900
Why are you asking only me
to understand?

52:05.040 --> 52:07.800
Are you really clueless?

52:08.240 --> 52:09.210
Yeah,

52:09.340 --> 52:12.100
Maybe I don't know
I don't have all the answers

52:12.240 --> 52:15.110
I don't know, so tell me
and let it off your chest

52:15.250 --> 52:16.800
Tell me!

52:16.950 --> 52:20.710
Will it change anything?
Will it?

52:22.350 --> 52:25.720
Su-mi

52:25.860 --> 52:30.920
Don't do this
Please don't

52:31.260 --> 52:34.320
You'll get sick again

52:35.370 --> 52:37.530
What?

52:48.080 --> 52:50.240
Fine

52:52.680 --> 52:56.240
From now on
anything that happens here

52:58.490 --> 53:01.890
all the filthy things
you brought here

53:03.530 --> 53:05.590
be responsible for it all

53:10.830 --> 53:14.200
I have nothing more to say
so answer the phone

54:34.150 --> 54:35.210
Do you remember?

54:35.350 --> 54:38.510
My memory's a bit blurry
but I think it did happen

54:38.660 --> 54:40.120
When was it?

54:40.260 --> 54:41.920
Hey, remember this?

54:42.060 --> 54:43.820
You jumped into the rive

54:43.960 --> 54:46.220
to catch some fish

54:46.560 --> 54:48.530
Then you started to drown

54:48.670 --> 54:51.430
and everyone had a fit

54:54.170 --> 54:56.640
There was another funny story

54:56.770 --> 54:59.970
What was it?
Oh yeah, I remember

55:00.110 --> 55:02.670
Remember that crazy guy?

55:02.910 --> 55:06.080
The funny thing is
is that he was always normal

55:06.220 --> 55:09.080
but whenever it rained
he went nuts

55:09.920 --> 55:11.180
While plowing the field

55:11.320 --> 55:13.690
he'd strip off his clothes
when it rained

55:13.820 --> 55:17.190
and run out into the highway

55:18.930 --> 55:20.590
The funniest time was

55:21.130 --> 55:23.100
when it rained off and on

55:23.230 --> 55:28.000
So he'd put on and take off
his clothes, again and again

55:28.840 --> 55:34.000
Then he got sick of it
and just went into his house

55:37.140 --> 55:41.910
Everyone in the neighborhood
laughed so much back then

55:42.050 --> 55:43.100
But when...

55:43.250 --> 55:46.610
But when he was little
he saw him doing that once

55:46.750 --> 55:50.120
He saw him doing that once
and then he ran together

55:50.250 --> 55:52.520
with that crazy guy

55:56.060 --> 55:59.760
Our mom saw that
and she almost passed out

56:00.100 --> 56:02.260
Do you remember?

56:02.600 --> 56:04.660
You remember, right?

56:06.800 --> 56:08.770
Say something

56:08.910 --> 56:10.770
Don't you remember?

56:11.210 --> 56:15.670
You remember, right?

56:20.120 --> 56:21.980
No

56:22.120 --> 56:23.590
I don't remember

56:25.120 --> 56:26.590
What?

56:30.930 --> 56:34.490
I said I don't remember

56:57.950 --> 56:59.950
Why don't you remember?

57:07.300 --> 57:09.560
Are you crazy?

57:38.630 --> 57:39.600
Mi-hee!

57:46.640 --> 57:48.070
Mi-hee!

57:49.240 --> 57:50.600
Wait, hold on to her

57:50.740 --> 57:52.500
- What's wrong?
- Wake up!

57:54.640 --> 57:56.110
Bring some water

57:56.250 --> 57:57.610
Are you alright, Mi-hee?

58:00.680 --> 58:02.050
Water, water

58:30.010 --> 58:31.980
I'm sorry, it's all my fault

58:44.330 --> 58:45.790
Mi-hee!

58:46.130 --> 58:47.490
It's okay

58:53.440 --> 58:56.410
It's alright, Mi-hee

58:57.040 --> 58:58.940
It's alright

59:39.220 --> 59:41.580
I'm sorry

59:43.620 --> 59:46.720
I didn't want to come
but your father begged me to

59:46.720 --> 59:49.020
so I had no choice

59:49.730 --> 59:52.490
- Honey
- Yes?

59:53.230 --> 59:57.000
I saw something strange
in that house

59:57.130 --> 59:59.690
What did you see?

59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.290
There was a girl
under the sink

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.130
Just go in

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.690
- Can't you just stay here?
- Why?

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:19.890
It's strange

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:22.190
What's strange?

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:24.200
It's strange

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:27.000
After the girls came down

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.800
weird things have been
happening in this house

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.200
Don't say stupid things

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.610
Didn't you see it?

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:40.410
You're just having a hard time adjusting
You'll get better if you rest

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.420
No

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:48.720
There's something
in this house

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:56.220
I'll look around,
so lie down

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.060
Open the door!

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.670
Open it!

01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:19.270
Open the god damn door!

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.080
I'll show you

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:46.290
Get up!

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:51.399
Get off the bed

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.700
Get off now!

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.640
I said now!

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.060
Come here, right now!

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.770
You pest...

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.490
Talk!

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:54.390
A person can't get any rest
around this household

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:01.990
Tell me
Who did it?

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.710
Who did it?

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.300
Who?
Better tell me the truth

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.710
Who did it!

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.110
Was it Su-mi?

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.910
You two need
to learn a lesson!

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:18.920
Was it your sister?

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:40.840
So do you feel better looking
at your dead mom's things?

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.140
Feel happy
after seeing the photos?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.800
Say that you're sorry

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.410
Until you do, don't even
think about coming out

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:26.720
There's no use in crying

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.920
Say that you're sorry
and beg for forgiveness!

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.530
I'm sorry

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.420
What?

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:38.030
Say it right

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.430
I'm sorry

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.440
I'll ask you once more

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:58.350
You're admitting
that you're sorry, right?

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.380
Stop crying

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:07.400
I don't want to hear it,
so stop it now!

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:13.990
Are you...

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.900
Are you mad?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.000
Is that why you're crying?

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:28.950
Fine, let's see
how long you hold up

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.020
This will put some sense
into you two

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:52.530
Su-yeon

01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:00.470
Su-yeon, I'm sorry

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:06.180
I didn't hear you

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.880
I'm sorry, Su-yeon
I'm sorry

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:23.390
This won't happen again

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.200
I promise

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.190
Don't cry, it's okay

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.820
- Tell me
- What?

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.120
Why the hell
are you doing this?

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.720
Tell me why you've acted

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.760
so weird since you got here

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.460
You really don't know?

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.760
Don't know what? What is it?

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.770
I'm talking about
what that woman is doing to us!

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.060
So tell me what has she done?

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:12.370
She keeps harassing Su-yeon

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:16.670
What?

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:18.870
Didn't you hear me?

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.280
I said she keeps harassing Su-yeon!

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.180
She's vicious, evil

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.190
and always locks Su-yeon up
in the closet!

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.790
Su-mi, please stop it

01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:32.890
Stop what?

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:37.690
You know that
Su-yeon is scared of her

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:42.300
Su-yeon, you tell dad

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.700
Stop crying
and tell him now

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.500
Tell him!

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.610
Please stop it!

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:57.120
Su-yeon... is dead

01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:04.050
What?

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.060
No...

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.470
Su-yeon is dead

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.970
So pull yourself together

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.580
How long will you keep this up?

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.590
It's not true, Su-yeon

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:47.600
Su-yeon...

01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:58.110
Su-yeon No... No...

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:28.870
Come down tomorrow,
I can't do it alone

01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:31.980
Hmm...

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.880
She's getting worse

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.520
I'll pick you up
call me when you get here

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.520
Su-yeon!

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.830
Su-yeon!

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.320
Su-yeon!

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.200
- Su-mi!
- Su-yeon!

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:42.090
Su-yeon!

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:43.300
Su-yeon!

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.000
Su-yeon!

01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:56.510
I am fed up with your family

01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:05.740
How did we come to this?

01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:15.650
Don't you get it yet?

01:29:19.090 --> 01:29:22.460
Remember what
I told you before?

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:28.470
Remember when I said
you'll regret it some day?

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:37.670
You...

01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:42.370
Know what's really scary?

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:49.080
You want to forget something

01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:53.590
Totally wipe it off of your mind

01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.990
But you never can

01:29:58.130 --> 01:30:00.330
It can't go away, you see

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.600
And...

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:09.600
And it follows you around
like a ghost

01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:16.320
Help me

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:31.230
Sure, I'll help you

01:30:32.170 --> 01:30:34.730
Let's end it here

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:21.210
Su-mi!

01:31:22.150 --> 01:31:23.620
Su-mi!

01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:25.620
Su-mi!

01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:53.240
Where's Su-mi?

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.540
Where?

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.770
Please stop it

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:03.280
I'm sick of it now

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:14.580
Take this
you'll feel much better

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.420
Su-mi!

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.900
Don't you get it yet?

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.800
You're just having
a hard time adjusting

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.100
You still must be sick

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.710
You promised not to
bring up that closet

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.900
How could we both get our periods
on the same date?

01:35:44.050 --> 01:35:45.510
Su-yeon is dead!

01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:47.110
No, I don't remember!

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.910
Su-mi, are you okay?

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:04.240
It's all over now

01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:08.750
You'll feel better here

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.760
Get some rest

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.460
I'll come and visit often

01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:32.180
Take care of yourself
Bye

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:41.990
Su-mi, what's wrong?
Let go

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.380
Let go, Su-mi

01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:50.490
Please stop it and let go

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:10.610
- No, I'll get it
- Let me take one

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.340
Mom...

01:42:12.930 --> 01:42:15.090
Su-yeon!

01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:32.220
Su-yeon!

01:47:26.110 --> 01:47:27.380
Mom?

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.380
Mom? Mom, mom!

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:38.290
Mom! Mom, mom, mom!

01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:39.590
Mom!

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:13.150
Didn't you hear something?

01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:18.160
Why'd you come up here?

01:49:19.090 --> 01:49:21.650
Dad's not here

01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:25.460
What do you mean by that?

01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:29.360
Now you're trying
to act like mom

01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:34.000
Do me a favor

01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:37.140
Stay out of our lives

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:45.180
Can you get out of the way?

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:47.890
I have to go

01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:53.090
You...

01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:55.790
You might regret this moment

01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:58.090
Keep that in mind!

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.700
What can be worse

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.000
than standing here with you?

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.000
When you're here

01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:13.110
I wanna be as far away
from you as I can

01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:15.310
Understand?

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.130
Su-mi!

01:50:33.970 --> 01:50:35.630
Su-mi!

01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:09.700
Help me... Su-mi

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:13.770
Su-mi... Su-mi...

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:17.280
Su-mi...

01:51:18.305 --> 01:51:24.946
