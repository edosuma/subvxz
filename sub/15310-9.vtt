WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.171
Mine curves to
the left when it's...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.172
Penis!

00:04.205 --> 00:05.506
Ding!

00:05.539 --> 00:07.908
Mine smells like death
and sauerkraut...
Grandmother!

00:07.941 --> 00:09.043
Ding!

00:09.077 --> 00:10.244
You get this when
I touch your...

00:10.278 --> 00:11.812
Headache.
Ding ding
ding ding

00:11.845 --> 00:13.181
ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding!

00:13.214 --> 00:15.083
Blistering round for

00:15.116 --> 00:16.884
the husband and wife team
Andi and Bobby,

00:16.917 --> 00:18.752
with 30
correct answers

00:18.786 --> 00:20.054
in 60 seconds.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.322
You know, in another life,

00:21.355 --> 00:22.690
I could've made
a great game show host.

00:22.723 --> 00:26.260
Well, you certainly have
the giant head for it.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.762
It's that kind of anger

00:28.796 --> 00:30.831
that scares off men.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.066
Up next,

00:32.100 --> 00:33.167
she's an actress,

00:33.201 --> 00:34.502
he owns a health
food restaurant.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.336
They're newly
engaged.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.606
Welcome, Jules
and Lowell!

00:40.874 --> 00:43.010
It's like watching
two chickens

00:43.043 --> 00:45.179
hypnotize
each other.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.014
Hey!

00:47.047 --> 00:48.182
Hey! Hey!

00:48.216 --> 00:49.683
Oh, we're up, sorry.
We're up, okay.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.120
Okay, here comes the ding.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.690
All right, my
favorite food is...

00:56.724 --> 00:58.526
Bean! Curd.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.560
Paste.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.694
Mush. Pass.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.763
Okay.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.897
All right, okay.

01:03.931 --> 01:04.865
My middle name is...

01:04.898 --> 01:06.033
Perfection.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.135
Just kidding.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.902
Um... uh, p-pass.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.404
Okay, pass.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.540
Okay, I have
a family history of...

01:12.573 --> 01:13.741
Pass!

01:14.942 --> 01:16.043
Oh, my God.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.745
This is
ridiculous.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.647
Aren't you at
all concerned

01:19.680 --> 01:20.981
that you two
are engaged

01:21.014 --> 01:22.450
and don't know a thing
about each other?

01:22.483 --> 01:25.052
Oh, well, while some
people value history,

01:25.085 --> 01:27.288
we value mystery.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.122
Oh, yeah.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.257
I love him.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.759
That's all
I need to know.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.128
Oh, that's sweet.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.564
Where's my friend?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.731
Oh, there she is.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.601
Hi, I've missed you.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.851
Jules and Lowell
are just so happy

01:57.885 --> 01:59.253
and in love.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.454
Of course they are.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.022
They barely
know each other.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.257
Mm-hmm.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.858
God, I'm exhausted.
Yeah.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.160
Oh.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.596
I just got
a calendar alert.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.764
It's Sex Tuesday.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.700
Already?
Mm-hmm.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.134
I didn't
get a...

02:14.168 --> 02:15.769
Oh, there it is.
Mm-hmm.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.939
Uh... do you want to take
each other's pants off?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.308
Nah...

02:20.341 --> 02:22.443
it's too
much work.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.544
Mmm.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.651
Oh, no, it's
the second Tuesday.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.255
All right,
I'm up.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.959
Oh, my God,
I have Mommy and Me tomorrow.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.127
Okay, I'm taking the 10,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.629
'cause the 405
is just ridiculous.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.163
And then afterwards,
I have to go to the market

02:43.197 --> 02:44.498
'cause I'm the one who's
supposed to bring the snacks,

02:44.532 --> 02:46.066
and some kid is
allergic to melon?

02:46.099 --> 02:47.801
Who is allergic to melon?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.140
Bobby?

03:00.448 --> 03:02.316
How did he fall asleep?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.685
Did you soak it
in chloroform?

03:06.254 --> 03:07.688
We're tired.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.990
We wake up at 6:00 a.m.
with Charlie.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.059
Okay, well, you gotta
change things up

03:12.092 --> 03:13.894
if you don't want him
snoozing on your kitty

03:13.927 --> 03:15.663
for the rest
of your life.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.864
Yeah, before you know it

03:16.897 --> 03:18.366
you're gonna be
scheduling sex.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.001
Hey, sorry
we're late.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.002
Did we miss
anything?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.837
Please say
it's the food.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.839
All right,
some complimentary

03:25.873 --> 03:27.708
algae shots
for my friends.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.042
Enjoy,

03:29.076 --> 03:31.412
and Namaste.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.881
Namaste.
Thank you.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.749
Thank you.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.818
Okay.
Okay.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.355
Mmm!

03:41.389 --> 03:43.724
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.693
Ugh.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.629
Well, now I know what
a frog's ass tastes like.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.134
It's true,

03:54.167 --> 03:55.235
the food is
repugnant,

03:55.269 --> 03:57.104
but the view...

03:57.137 --> 03:58.739
is unbeatable.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.644
Kate is dating
Steve the waiter.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.612
A waiter, huh?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.046
That's not usually
your type.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.081
Well, he's also
a waiter

04:08.115 --> 04:09.750
in the bedroom.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.119
Was everything to
your satisfaction?

04:12.152 --> 04:15.589
Very much to
my satisfaction.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.659
Hope you saved
room for dessert.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.928
I could be tempted.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.075
Oh, my.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.445
That's big
enough for two.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.350
Gosh, you are
such a... dude.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.018
Thank you.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.620
Jules...

04:47.621 --> 04:49.022
Oh, my God.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.958
It's Jack,
the guy that I used to...

04:50.991 --> 04:52.192
Jules!

04:52.225 --> 04:53.461
You're back from India.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.663
Hi, Jack, listen.
Things have sort of...

05:00.501 --> 05:01.969
...changed for me.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.437
Darling...

05:03.471 --> 05:06.273
why was that man just
tongue-blasting you?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.841
I'm her friend Jack.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.610
I'm her fiancé, Lowell.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.111
Ooh, drama!

05:11.144 --> 05:12.613
Fight, fight!

05:12.646 --> 05:15.048
Fight...
No, no, no, no.

05:15.916 --> 05:16.884
No...

05:16.917 --> 05:18.051
no fight.

05:18.085 --> 05:18.952
I'm sure that
Jules can explain.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.688
Okay.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.823
Jack and I used
to model together,

05:22.856 --> 05:23.957
and occasionally...

05:23.991 --> 05:25.325
hook up.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.828
And I kind of forgot
to tell him I was engaged.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.232
So should I...

05:37.004 --> 05:38.539
I am so, so sorry.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.007
Don't worry about it,
all right?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.308
We've all got
bits of baggage.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.544
I mean, you've got...
this guy,

05:43.577 --> 05:45.212
I was engaged
twice before.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.680
So...

05:48.582 --> 05:50.684
Oh, no.
Kitchen fire.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.755
I knew it.
I. Knew. It.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.457
Bathroom now.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.093
Just the girls.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.671
Jules, look,
we need to know

06:10.704 --> 06:12.172
what happened
to those fiancées.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.274
And we are certainly
not gonna find out

06:14.307 --> 06:16.944
from Mr. Outback Fakehouse.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.579
You are totally cynical.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.581
You have a pattern of
rushing into relationships,

06:20.614 --> 06:22.416
and this time,
you could really get burned.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.685
Kate, he will tell me
in his own good time.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.186
Seriously, let me handle it.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.421
Okay.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.590
All right.
I'll let you handle it.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.793
You're not gonna
let her handle it.
I am not gonna

06:32.826 --> 06:34.127
let her handle it.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.230
Whoa.
Val texted me.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.365
Val texted me, "Hi."

06:38.398 --> 06:39.399
She hasn't texted
me in weeks.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.701
What should I say?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.235
Tell her you're signing
your divorce papers

06:42.269 --> 06:43.437
and get on
with your life.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.138
I want to put
on a tuxedo

06:45.172 --> 06:46.640
and sing to her.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.142
Okay, you're
spiraling out.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.111
I made a promise
to love her forever,

06:51.144 --> 06:52.546
and I can't just
turn that off.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.081
All right, look,
if you're gonna play,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.282
at least play to win.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.817
First thing you do
is you don't respond.

06:56.850 --> 06:57.818
I gotta respond.

06:57.851 --> 06:58.786
No.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.220
Because sometimes,
the best response

07:00.253 --> 07:01.288
is no response.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.891
See that?

07:03.924 --> 07:04.958
"Can we talk?"

07:04.992 --> 07:06.059
Type "yes."

07:06.093 --> 07:07.561
"YES" in all caps.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.130
With a smiley-face emoticon
so she'll know I'm fun.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.599
I'm typing "no."
No!

07:11.632 --> 07:13.100
Don't type "no."
Don't type "no"!

07:14.167 --> 07:15.569
See that? "No."

07:15.603 --> 07:17.771
It's the most erotic word
in the English language.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.140
At least, that's what
my wife tells me.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.747
This is incredible.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.617
Val has texted me seven times
since we've left the restaurant.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.752
"Want to meet for coffee?"

07:31.785 --> 07:32.586
No.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.921
"Lunch next week?"

07:33.954 --> 07:35.255
Negative.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.757
"Can we Skype?"

07:36.790 --> 07:39.126
As the French would say, non.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.995
She's frothing at the mouth.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.698
You were right, man.
It's the power of "no."

07:46.734 --> 07:49.136
Bobby...
does it bother you

07:49.169 --> 07:51.639
that our lives have become
completely predictable?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.006
What are you
talking about?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.675
I know everything about you,

07:54.708 --> 07:56.209
and you know
everything about me.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.444
Like, for instance, tonight,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.346
we both want to have
a second dinner,

07:59.379 --> 08:00.781
get too bloated to have sex

08:00.814 --> 08:02.616
and then fall asleep
watching TV.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.117
Great.
Nuke the burritos.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.185
I'll get the remote.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.887
No, Bobby, I'm serious.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.721
Think about it.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.356
For the rest
of our lives,

08:09.389 --> 08:10.958
until we die,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.794
there will be no more
shocking revelations,

08:13.827 --> 08:15.529
no more intimate
discoveries...

08:15.563 --> 08:17.230
Nothing new, ever.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.466
Wow.
Yeah.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.134
Never really thought
about it that way.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.203
Guess we should
add some variety.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.038
Yes, we should.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.139
I have an idea.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.808
You are not
putting it there.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.178
Just trying to throw a little
pineapple on the pizza.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.192
Okay, what happened
with the other fiancées?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.326
Oh.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.327
Right.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.329
Okay. Um...

08:49.362 --> 08:50.530
Well...

08:50.564 --> 08:53.166
Look, they were fair
dinkum for a tick,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.669
but you know the saying,
"Without come a guster,

08:55.703 --> 08:58.271
you're never gonna
find good oil."

09:06.479 --> 09:08.515
Hey. I need
to talk to you.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.583
Oh, Lowell.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.751
Thought you'd be
at the restaurant.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.352
Yeah, no, I'm just
heading there now.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.353
See you, babe.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.354
See, it's
actually time

09:14.387 --> 09:15.889
to drain the tofu.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.592
The curd congeals, and you
need a cheesecloth just to...

09:20.493 --> 09:22.062
Steve the waiter
got me the names

09:22.095 --> 09:24.397
of the other fiancées,
and I tracked them down.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.933
Kate!
Don't worry.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.935
I was discreet.

09:28.836 --> 09:32.205
Hi. I'm with
the U.S. Census Bureau.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.608
The U.S. Census Bureau?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.877
Why does the Census
Bureau care about

09:36.910 --> 09:38.746
my relationship
with Lowell?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.648
You know,
a lot of people

09:40.681 --> 09:42.449
ask questions
like that.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.385
They're called
"terrorists."

09:45.418 --> 09:46.987
I wish you
hadn't done that.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.789
But since you did,
what'd they say?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.991
He left the day
of our wedding.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.459
I was heartbroken.

09:52.492 --> 09:55.328
He banged
my little sister.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.464
She and I
still don't talk.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.567
My deepest sympathy.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.137
And now I should
probably count you, so...

10:05.005 --> 10:06.506
One.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.475
Oh, my God.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.777
I don't know
anything about him.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.278
Maybe you were right.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.913
Maybe I rushed
into this.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.347
Aw, honey.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.016
I get it.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.585
The smooth abs,
the beachy smell...

10:18.618 --> 10:21.221
You were thinking
with your kitty.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.292
We all do it sometimes.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.541
Hi. In the mood
for a little company?

10:41.574 --> 10:43.977
Why? Do I look
like a hooker to you?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.379
No, no. God, no.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.683
Well, maybe a little, yes.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.685
Good! That's what
I was going for.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.788
My husband and I were trying
to spice things up,

10:54.822 --> 10:56.656
you know, add a few surprises.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.159
You know what'd
really surprise him?
Hmm?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.995
If you gave me a handy
for a hundred bucks.

11:02.029 --> 11:06.099
How about I give you
a nut crusher for free?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.342
Oh.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.181
Hey, there.
Hello.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.016
What's your name?

11:23.050 --> 11:26.053
Dominique.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.055
And you are?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.656
John...

11:29.689 --> 11:31.424
Varva-tos.

11:31.458 --> 11:36.329
Do you mean John Varvatos,
like the clothing designer?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.497
Crap. Restart.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.932
Okay.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.335
Hi.
Hey, there.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.837
I'm Charlie.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.106
Like our son Charlie?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.878
I'm gonna go back
to Varvatos, okay?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.045
Okay.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.281
So, uh, Dominique...
Mm. Mm-hmm?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.515
...can I buy you a drink?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.085
Oh, you can buy more
than a drink.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.720
You know, if you're looking
for a good time.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.089
I'm always looking
for a good time.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.724
Oh. Well, you'll have
to make it quick.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.293
Quick?
Mm-hmm.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.361
It's my specialty.
Oh...

12:08.395 --> 12:13.733
Great, 'cause I have to, uh,
pick up my daughter at daycare.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.435
Whoa, whoa.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.436
What-what?

12:16.469 --> 12:17.604
Time-out.
Why?

12:17.637 --> 12:19.139
You're supposed
to be a sexy hooker.

12:19.172 --> 12:24.311
I am... so that I can
support my blind daughter.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.049
That's not sexy.
That's the opposite of sexy.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.884
Okay, but if I
don't have a kid,

12:30.918 --> 12:33.720
then why would I resort
to prostitution?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.956
I don't know.
Because you love sex.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.231
Ah, Mrs. Grossbard,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.033
it looks like the...

12:47.367 --> 12:49.837
Val, what are you doing here?
I don't have time to socialize.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.772
This isn't social. It's vaginal.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.908
But I'm not your gynecologist.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.910
I decided I needed a change,

12:56.944 --> 12:58.745
and I thought
you could do it

12:58.778 --> 13:01.248
since clearly you've moved on.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.150
I have moved on,

13:03.183 --> 13:07.354
so I will gladly
examine your vagina.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.993
As a doctor who has moved on.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.962
Quick heads-up:
I removed the carpeting.

13:14.995 --> 13:18.798
I am ready for the hardwood
installation.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.170
I will put a note in your file.

13:23.203 --> 13:27.274
Will, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.909
I will be right back.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.612
Did I hear that right?
Is that Val in there?
Yeah.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.847
And she wants to
have sex with me.

13:33.881 --> 13:34.948
Do you want sex in your office,

13:34.982 --> 13:36.283
or do you want your wife back?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.384
I want my wife back.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.551
Well, then make her earn it.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.987
You walk away from this
right now,

13:40.020 --> 13:41.321
or she will never respect you.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.790
You realize
how long it's been since...?

13:43.823 --> 13:47.027
Do it yourself
just like the rest of us.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.701
Oh, Lowell.

13:54.734 --> 13:55.969
Hi.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.105
Just came to pick up some...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.241
...takeout.
Uh, Steve,

14:01.274 --> 14:02.976
could you give us
a moment, mate?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.145
I'll go punch out...
and oil up.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.579
Thank you.

14:06.613 --> 14:10.050
Jules hasn't spoken to me
since I left for work yesterday.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.584
What did you say to her?

14:11.618 --> 14:15.155
Just that you're a lying,
cheating douche from Down Under

14:15.188 --> 14:17.490
and she's lucky she found out.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.992
Found out? Found out what?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.394
Found out what? Found out what?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.899
Talk to you ex's green card,
Johnny.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.001
You investigated me?

14:28.035 --> 14:31.004
Yeah, and I know you left
your first fiancée at the altar.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.773
What altar?!
We never even got to the church.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.009
What, uh... what do you mean?

14:36.043 --> 14:37.577
We were 17, all right?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.346
I was here
as an exchange student.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.182
And we were going to elope,
but her parents found out.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.084
Didn't she mention
that we were just kids?

14:44.117 --> 14:46.886
Well, I may have left as soon

14:46.920 --> 14:49.456
as I got the damning
information I needed.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.757
Right.
But you still slept

14:50.790 --> 14:52.792
with the other
fiancée's sister.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.027
No, I didn't!

14:54.061 --> 14:55.562
Okay, how about
a little fact check?

14:55.595 --> 14:56.964
No, please,
don't do that.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.298
Oh, it's done.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.632
Hello?

14:59.666 --> 15:03.770
Ms. McKnight, Jane Austen
from the U.S. Census Bureau.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.706
Jane Austen?
The novelist Jane Austen?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.108
Yeah, I needed an alias,

15:08.141 --> 15:10.710
and I could tell
she wasn't a reader.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.312
How can I help you, Ms. Austen?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.114
Could you please restate
your reasons

15:14.147 --> 15:16.216
for terminating your nuptials
with Lowell?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.884
He slept with my little sister.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.552
Aha, right.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.920
Thank you.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.889
He also slept with my mother
and my grandmother

15:22.922 --> 15:24.724
and my great-grandmother.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.527
He's a time traveler.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.133
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead
and hang up now.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.402
She's unwell, okay?
Ah.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.736
She hid it at first,

15:36.769 --> 15:38.071
but she went off her meds.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.673
And when I found out,
I tried to help her.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.442
She just kept setting fire
to ants,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.844
yelling, "I am your god!"

15:44.877 --> 15:47.747
So...

15:47.780 --> 15:50.517
my bad.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.528
I was riding by your house
and the sprinklers got me.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.595
Now I'm all wet.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.031
Sprinklers aren't on.

16:04.064 --> 16:07.200
Then maybe it's just me.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.770
Look, we were together
for 12 years,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.839
and I know we had
our ups and downs,

16:12.872 --> 16:15.342
but I care about you
and I can't just stop!

16:15.375 --> 16:18.211
The things I do
for new patients.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.946
Let's go!

16:19.979 --> 16:22.949
So this is what
giving up looks like.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.652
I think it suits us.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.623
Whoo!

16:30.657 --> 16:34.127
Oh, my God!

16:34.161 --> 16:36.029
Why are Will and Val
in our bed?

16:36.063 --> 16:37.797
'Cause he did not
listen to my advice.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.666
And you cannot do
that on a foldout

16:39.699 --> 16:41.568
in the guestroom.

16:41.601 --> 16:46.005
Oh, come on.
We eat there.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.374
There's no stopping 'em now.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.976
I once tried to do that
with two dogs,

16:50.009 --> 16:52.079
and it didn't end well.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.547
Take it off!

16:54.581 --> 16:56.049
So brazen,
so wrong.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.685
God, I feel like we're,
like, back in college.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.819
Totally.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.355
Wow! Hang on.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.360
Wow, now, that's a surprise.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.229
Remember when we met
back in my senior year,

17:09.262 --> 17:10.930
we just, like, couldn't
get enough of each other?

17:10.963 --> 17:12.099
We didn't care
who was around?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.266
Yeah, I know.
We just did it.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.168
Yeah. Get those
sweatpants off,

17:15.202 --> 17:17.370
and make it quick or
we'll be late for class.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.439
Yeah, if we're late,
we might get punished

17:19.472 --> 17:21.174
sexually by that
hot female professor.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.343
All right, I'll give
you that one.
Okay.

17:23.376 --> 17:27.046
Give it to me, John "Varva-tos."

17:29.216 --> 17:32.051
I told you not
to get involved.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.188
Yeah, but not in those
exact words.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.524
No! In those exact words!

17:37.557 --> 17:38.725
You know what?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.127
This isn't all
Kate's fault.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.061
I have to take some
of the blame for this.

17:42.095 --> 17:45.064
Oh, you can have it all.
It's okay.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.399
When you asked me,

17:46.433 --> 17:48.034
I should have been
totally honest,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.370
but the truth is,
I didn't go into details

17:50.403 --> 17:53.806
'cause... I was
embarrassed.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.077
I chose badly... twice.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.079
Now, what does
that say about me?

18:00.113 --> 18:04.083
You only had to choose right
once, and you did.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.253
You chose me.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.826
See?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.295
You came through this crisis,

18:15.328 --> 18:17.797
and your love
is stronger for it.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.800
Know what
I'm looking forward to?

18:20.833 --> 18:23.170
The wedding.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.773
I'm gonna dance.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.278
Hey...

18:41.554 --> 18:42.589
That was amazing.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.756
Yes, it was.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.759
So where should
we go for dinner?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.862
Huh? Mozza?

18:49.896 --> 18:51.464
Uh-oh.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.201
What?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.936
It's just-- the idea
of being with you again

18:56.969 --> 18:58.838
was really exciting,
and I thought I...

18:58.871 --> 19:01.274
but now that we've...
I'm just not.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.643
Wait. Hold on,
hold on.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.878
You just wanted what
you couldn't have,

19:05.912 --> 19:07.614
and now that... now that you've
got it, you're done?

19:07.647 --> 19:11.351
That makes me sound
like the bad guy here.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.187
You know what?

19:18.425 --> 19:20.627
I've been carrying
these around for weeks.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.663
I've not been able to
bring myself to sign them.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.001
You like it when I say no?

19:29.035 --> 19:31.338
Well, get ready to go nuts.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.541
Because here is your divorce.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.579
You know, maybe
we should go to Mozza.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.348
Good-bye, Val.

19:53.426 --> 19:57.564
"Get ready to go nuts
'cause here's your divorce"?

19:59.131 --> 20:01.067
So badass!

20:01.100 --> 20:03.436
We are very proud
of you, Will.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.172
You guys have been in here
the whole time?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.940
Yeah! For the moaning
and the squealing.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.910
And that part where it sounded
like someone was slapping

20:10.943 --> 20:12.679
a fish against
a snare drum.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.013
Hey, quick question.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.916
Which one of you cried
during the big finish?
Yeah.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.751
Okay, what are the chances

20:18.785 --> 20:21.288
that you won't tell anyone
about the crying?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.855
Slim to none.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.724
Already sent
a group text.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.766
Hey.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.468
Last night was amazing.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.103
And I know
we've had a bit

20:37.136 --> 20:38.371
of a dry spell lately.
Mm.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.639
I mean,
besides last night,

20:39.672 --> 20:41.708
I can't even remember
the last time we...

20:41.741 --> 20:43.876
Exactly six weeks.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.712
That's... Wow, okay.
Yeah.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.880
Anyway, I think
our little college fun

20:47.914 --> 20:49.248
symbolizes a new beginning.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.719
Hmm.
One full of passion,
romance and sexual...

20:52.752 --> 20:54.120
I'm pregnant.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.756
Surprise.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.891
Oh, my God!

20:58.925 --> 20:59.892
I know.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.494
Oh, my God!

21:01.528 --> 21:03.229
I have one more surprise.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.465
It's John Varvatos's baby.
Oh, boy.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.301
