03:34.614 --> 03:38.451
>> BUT BEFORE WE GOT THE COOKOUT
TO SIX, THE LAST PART OF OUR

03:38.451 --> 03:40.520
MISSION WAS TO GET ALYSSA OUT OF

FIRST WE HAVE TO WIN H.O.H.

03:43.990 --> 03:48.194

XAVIER.

04:00.807 --> 04:04.277
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.579
>> HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

04:06.579 --> 04:10.316
>> THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SMOOTH SAILING BUT UNFORTUNATELY

04:10.316 --> 04:14.887
I HAD TO PUT UP KYLAND WHICH IS
WHERE THINGS GOT A BIT MESSY.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.656
>> YOU ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY
DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.259
>> I DON'T, I THINK IT SHOULD BE
ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAVEN'T

04:20.259 --> 04:22.629
GONE UP AT ALL.

04:22.629 --> 04:32.505
IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE WE
HAVE TO KEEP THEM EITHER WAY.

04:32.505 --> 04:36.376
>> DON'T-- YOU CAN TELL THAT
KYLAND IS FRUSTRATED IT IS

04:36.376 --> 04:37.744
WRITTEN ALL OVER HIS FACE.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.246
I GET THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
ON THE BLOCK KYLAND.

04:40.246 --> 04:44.050
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALYSSA
IS GOING HOME, REGARDLESS.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.486
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY
YOU ARE FIGHTING ME ON THIS.

04:46.486 --> 04:58.164
>> IT SUCKS THAT TWO PEOPLE-- I
DO THESE THINGS FOR THE GROUP.

04:58.164 --> 04:59.732
>> WILL YOU PUT UP KY.

04:59.732 --> 05:06.806
>> DO YOU THINK THAT KY COMES
AFTER ME BECAUSE I PUT HIM UP

05:06.806 --> 05:07.073
LAST WEEK.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.241
>> NO.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.343
>> Julie: FACE YOUR HOUSE
MATES AND MAKE YOUR REPLACEMENT

05:10.343 --> 05:11.210
NOMINATION.

05:11.210 --> 05:16.049
>> I'M SORRY KYLAND, PLEASE TAKE
A SEAT.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.719
>> WITH WHYLAND AND ALISO ON THE
BLOCK WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW HOW

05:19.719 --> 05:22.522
THIS VOTE IS GOING TO GO AND
WILL PRETTY MUCH SEND ALYSSA

05:22.522 --> 05:23.723
RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.

05:23.723 --> 05:27.760
>> YEAH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
ANYONE NEEDS TO TO HAVE THE

05:27.760 --> 05:28.628
CONVERSATION.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.863
>> I DIDN'T OBVIOUSLY-- FOR
APPEARANCES.

05:30.863 --> 05:36.569
>> WHAT IS THE POINT, SHE IS
GOING TO JURY, GOING

05:36.569 --> 05:38.404
TO-- EVERYONE RIGHT NOW IS
TRYING TO WORK ON JURY

05:38.404 --> 05:42.475
MANAGEMENT FOR ALYSSA, THIS IS
POINTLESS.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.043
>> WHY, WHO IS THE APPEARANCE
FOR.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.579
>> ALL OF US KNOW WHAT IS ABOUT
TO HAPPEN.

05:46.579 --> 05:51.184
SO RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED
ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE COMING OFF

05:51.184 --> 05:53.252
TO ALYSSA IT IS ANNOYING.

05:53.252 --> 05:56.322
>> IT IS JUST FOR A EARNS PAS,
WHOSE APPEARANCES.

05:56.322 --> 05:59.158
>> I WANT TO YOU CALM DOWN.

05:59.158 --> 06:02.295
>> THAT IS CON TRA DIBLGHTARY,
YOU BASICALLY SAID APPEARANCES.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.598
>> KYLAND IS STEAMING AND I AM
REALLY UNSURE OF WHAT HE IS

06:05.598 --> 06:06.766
UPSET ABOUT.

06:06.766 --> 06:10.336
WE ARE SO CLOSE TO GETTING
ALYSSA OUT IT IS NOT THE TIME TO

06:10.336 --> 06:11.204
FREAK OUT.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.673
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE UPSET
ABOUT TODAY.

06:13.673 --> 06:14.741
TAKE THE WHEEL.

06:14.741 --> 06:18.478
WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE, PASSING A
VOTE TO EVICT ALYSSA.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.180
>> I CALLED YOU BACK HERE
BECAUSE CAN I TELL YOU ARE UPSET

06:21.180 --> 06:26.719
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE-- I AM
ASKING YOU, WHY, WHAT HAPPENED?

06:26.719 --> 06:28.087
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

06:28.087 --> 06:30.523
>> I'M JUST IRRITATED BE .

06:30.523 --> 06:38.498
>> Julie: BY A VOTE OF 3-1,

>> LOVE YOU.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.471
>> BYE ALYSSA, GOOD LUCK.

06:45.471 --> 06:51.177
>> LET YOUR HAIR DOWN.

06:51.177 --> 06:56.549
>> WE DID IT.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.585
>> OH MY GOD.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.053
>> FINAL SIX BABY.

07:01.053 --> 07:05.691
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MADE
HISTORY, IT IS AMAZING.

07:05.691 --> 07:10.797
>> WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH
FIGHTING, CRIES, NOT TRUSTING

07:10.797 --> 07:14.167
EACH OTHER AND GUESS WHAT, WE
STUCK TO THAT PLAN AND LOOK WHAT

07:14.167 --> 07:15.334
HAPPENED.

07:15.334 --> 07:20.206
WE WERE ABLE TO GET ALL SIX OF
ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE

07:20.206 --> 07:22.074
FINAL SIX, THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.310
>> THE BEST ALLIANCE TO EVER DO
IT.

07:24.310 --> 07:24.677
>> DAY ONE.

07:24.677 --> 07:25.845
>> DAY ONE.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.381
>> 65, AND ALL OF US MADE IT TO
THE END.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.417
>> SO FAR IN THIS GAME WE'VE ALL
HAD EACH OTHER'S BACK.

07:31.417 --> 07:34.787
BUT NOW IT IS REALLY AN
INDIVIDUAL GAME AND IT'S EVERY

07:34.787 --> 07:37.924
MAN FOR HIMSELF.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.125
>> WOW.

07:39.125 --> 07:45.064
>> I AM WILLING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO GET TO THE END AND

07:45.064 --> 07:46.199
WIN $750,000.

07:46.199 --> 07:50.469
>> WE ACCOMPLISHED A GOAL AT
THIS POINT.

07:50.469 --> 07:53.439
BIG BROTHER 23 WILL CROWN ITS
FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER.

07:53.439 --> 07:56.609
AND THAT IS BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE
PERSON IN THIS CIRCLE RIGHT

07:56.609 --> 07:57.810
HERE.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.911
THIS IS A WIN FOR ALL OF US, NO
MATTER WHO IS SITTING IN THE

07:58.911 --> 08:01.581
FINAL TWO CHAIRS, ALL OF US
SHOULD CONSIDER OURSELVES

08:01.581 --> 08:01.914
WINNERS.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.182
ALL RIGHT.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.884
>> THE TIME AND EFFORT I PUT IN
THIS SEASON HAVE PAID OFF TO GET

08:04.884 --> 08:06.152
US ALL TO THIS POINT.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.488
IT IS AN AMAZES FEELING.

08:09.488 --> 08:13.426
HOWEVER, I DO NOT REALIZE THIS
IS STARTS PHASE TWO OF THE

08:13.426 --> 08:17.163
GAMING, THE BB END GAME WHICH
MEANS HAVE I TO DO WHATEVER I

08:17.163 --> 08:21.200
CAN TO ENSURE I'M SITTING ON ONE
OF THOSE TWO CHAIRS COME FINALE

08:21.200 --> 08:21.834
NIGHT.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.970
>> IT IS THE SIX.
>> WOW.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.347
>> I DID NOT, I NEED YOU TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.884
I DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS
PUTTING ON THE BLOCK UNTIL-- I

08:37.884 --> 08:39.752
DIDN'T KNOW.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.888
>> DOUBLE EVICTION WENT SO FAST.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.958
NOW THAT I HAVE SOME TIME TO
RELAX AND EVERYONE CAN BE AT

08:45.958 --> 08:52.398
EASE, I WANT TO TALK WITH KYLAND
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

08:52.398 --> 08:53.933
GOTTEN ON THE SAME MAIJ.

08:53.933 --> 08:57.970
I DON'T-- ON THE SAME PAGE, I
DON'T WANT US TO HAVE ANY ISSUES

08:57.970 --> 09:02.208
FROM THE PAST MOVING FORWARD.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.377
>> I DID NOT KNOW WHY YOU WERE
UPSET.

09:04.377 --> 09:13.953
BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT
THAT.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.255
I-- .

09:16.255 --> 09:19.325
>> I THINK IT IS HABIT.

09:19.325 --> 09:28.567
WE DO APPEARANCES, WE ARE
PRIORITIZEING HOW.

09:28.567 --> 09:33.439
>> I'M FEELING AS GOOD AS CAN I
WITH TIFFANY, I WAS FRUSTRATED

09:33.439 --> 09:37.710
EARLIER BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
SHE WAS PUTTING AN ATTEMPT AT

09:37.710 --> 09:42.715
GAINING POINTS FOR ALYSSA'S JURY
VOTE OVER MY OWN FEELINGS IN THE

09:42.715 --> 09:44.917
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT I'M GOOD WITH

09:44.917 --> 09:49.088
EVERYONE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHO WILL WIN THIS NEXT H.O.H.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.256
COMPETITION.

09:50.256 --> 09:57.697
>> THE POINT IS, ANY ACTION
AFTER-- WERE FOR APPEARANCES,

09:57.697 --> 09:58.197
REGARDLESS OF INTENTION.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.332
>> UH-HUH.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.968
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY
REGARDLESS OF INTENTION THAT IS

10:01.968 --> 10:09.342
THE IMPACT THAT OCCURRED.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.378
>> .

10:12.378 --> 10:19.452
>> I FEEL RELIEVED THAT WE ARE
ALL HERE.

10:19.452 --> 10:34.400
AND THAT WE'RE ALWAYS-- I KNOW
THAT PEOPLE WERE UPSET AND IT IS

10:34.400 --> 10:38.404
UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE THAT
WASN'T THE PLAN.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.707
IT MADE ME LOOK SELFISH.

10:41.707 --> 10:46.579
>> NONE OF US HAVE HAD TO DO
THAT.

10:46.579 --> 10:57.957
>> SO I'M A THREAT?

10:57.957 --> 11:03.129
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE
SURE IF XAVIER WINS H ORGANIZE H

11:03.129 --> 11:06.532
THIS WEEK THAT HE IS NOT COMING
FOR ME, BUT IF I WIN THIS

11:06.532 --> 11:11.270
H.O.H., I'M DEFINITELY COMING
AFTER XAVIER, HE IS BEASTING

11:11.270 --> 11:13.205
THROUGH COMPS LIKE NOTHING I
HAVE EVER SEEN.

11:13.205 --> 11:17.977
HE IS VERY LIGHT AND LOYAL IN
HIS GAME AND HAS ALL OF THE

11:17.977 --> 11:22.181
FACTORS FOR ANYONE IN JURY TO
WANT TO VOTE FOR HIM, SO I WANT

11:22.181 --> 11:23.416
XAVIER OUT OF HERE.

11:23.416 --> 11:28.754
>> I KNOW NOW WE GET TO PLAY FOR
OURSELVE AND AS STRONG AS YOU

11:28.754 --> 11:29.989
ARE.

11:29.989 --> 11:38.130
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO BE THE
NEXT PERSON TO LEAVE IN ORDER

11:38.130 --> 11:40.066
FOR ME TO HAVE A CHANCE IN THIS
GAME.

11:40.066 --> 11:44.070
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT I'M
THE FIRST PERSON TO LEAVE.

11:44.070 --> 11:47.907
>> OKAY, NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO
BUTTER MY BISCUITS A LITTLE BIT,

11:47.907 --> 11:50.609
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS THIS IS THE
KISS UP TIME.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.446
TIFFANY, I GOT NOTHING BUT LOVE
FOR YOU ON A PERSONAL LEVEL BUT

11:53.446 --> 11:57.583
FROM A GAME STANDPOINT YOU HAVE
SHOWN ARE YOU NOT AFRAID TO GO

11:57.583 --> 11:58.517
AGAIN ME.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.453
SO I MIGHT JUST NEED TO TAKE
THAT SHOT FIRST.

12:00.453 --> 12:09.962
>> IF YOU WIN THE H.O.H., GO
FROM THERE.

12:09.962 --> 12:10.863
>> OKAY.

12:10.863 --> 12:16.068
KY, KY, KY, WHY OH WHY DO I DO
THIS TO THY?

12:16.068 --> 12:19.805
>> IT IS TIME FOR SOME DAMAGE
CONTROL, A BIG BROTHER STAPLE.

12:19.805 --> 12:23.442
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT KYLAND
AND I ARE GOOD IN THE EVENT HE

12:23.442 --> 12:25.311
DOES WIN THE NEXT H.O.H.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.348
ME THROWING HIM ON THE BLOCK
THIS WEEK AS A REPLACEMENT NOM

12:29.348 --> 12:33.119
GIVES HIM AN EXCUSE TO USE ME AS
A PAWN NEXT WEEK.

12:33.119 --> 12:36.489
LET ME NIP THIS IN THE BUD
BEFORE IT FESTERS INTO SOMETHING

12:36.489 --> 12:37.690
BIGGER.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.059
>> I LITERALLY HOLD NOTHING ON
YOU FOR IT, I LITERALLY DON'T.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.961
>> I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE TO
YOU.

12:41.961 --> 12:42.962
>> YEAH.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.396
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

12:44.396 --> 12:44.997
>> YEAH.

12:44.997 --> 12:45.931
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.867
I'M FEELING FINE.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.002
I ASSUMED THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY
HAPPEN.

12:50.002 --> 12:56.041
AM I LOOKING TO WORK WITH-- LONG
TERM, PROBABLY NOT.

12:56.041 --> 13:00.146
>> I'M SORRY, I'M REALLY SORRY,
THAT WAS A VERY INTENSE HOUR

13:00.146 --> 13:03.682
WHERE EVERYTHING WAS RUSHED AND
MY HEAD WAS IN A BILLION

13:03.682 --> 13:05.951
DIFFERENT PLACES.

13:05.951 --> 13:11.991
>> AND NOW IT IS CHILD CUZ IT'S
LIKE GAME ON.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.225
>> THIS IS REAL.

13:13.225 --> 13:16.562
>> I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
THAT WE HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE

13:16.562 --> 13:26.605
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY THE GAME
WITHIN ALL RIGHT.

13:26.605 --> 13:31.977
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY THE GAME
WITHIN ALL RIGHT.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.748
>> WHERE ARE YOU AT?

13:35.748 --> 13:38.150
>> I-- I'M FRAYING CAN I WIN
THIS.

13:38.150 --> 13:43.055
IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU
WOULD-- UNLESS YOU DESPERATELY

13:43.055 --> 13:45.758
WANT IT BADLY BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO TAKE THE SHOT.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.928
I'M GOING TO PUT TIFFANY AND
HANNAH ON THE BLOCK.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.198
>> TIFFANY IS MY TARGET ALWAYS
WILL BE MY TARGET.

13:52.198 --> 13:57.903
LET'S GET IT COOKING UP IN THIS
COOKOUTMENT LET'S GO, BABY.

13:57.903 --> 14:03.008
COME ON.

14:03.008 --> 14:09.949
>> HANNAH, THEN I'M GOING TO
PUT.

14:09.949 --> 14:19.992
>> OKAY FIRST HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THIS H.O.H.-- AS LONG AS

14:19.992 --> 14:28.701
>> OKAY FIRST HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THIS H.O.H.-- AS LONG AS

14:28.701 --> 14:33.939
THE RIGHT PEOPLE WIN.

14:33.939 --> 14:43.983
>> I'M ASKING BECAUSE I'M
LIKE-- I WAB TO AND I THINK YOU

14:43.983 --> 14:53.959
>> I'M ASKING BECAUSE I'M
LIKE-- I WAB TO AND I THINK YOU

14:53.959 --> 14:54.727
WANT TO.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.894
>> NOW THAT WE ARE DOWN TO THE
SIX.

14:55.894 --> 15:00.499
>> HAVE I TO MAKE TRUE FINAL
DECISIONS ON WHO I WANT TO SIT

15:00.499 --> 15:03.035
NEXT TO AT THE END.

15:03.035 --> 15:07.172
AND FOR A LOT OF REASONS, THAT'S
XAVIER.

15:07.172 --> 15:10.542
IS HE INCREDIBLE COMPETITOR AND
ARGUABLY THE BEST PLAYER.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.646
I ONLY WANT TO GO TO THE END
WITH THE BEST.

15:13.646 --> 15:21.887
I THINK AT THIS POINT THAT'S
XAVIER.

15:21.887 --> 15:23.088
>> WAS' DONE.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.959
>> MAKING THE FINAL TWO DEAL
WITH KYLAND IS GOOD FOR MY GAME

15:26.959 --> 15:30.963
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS ARGUABLY
THE STRONGEST COMPETITOR

15:30.963 --> 15:34.900
REMAINING OUTSIDE OF MYSELF AND
I THINK IF I SIT NEXT TO KYLAND

15:34.900 --> 15:37.169
IN THE FINAL TWO I HAVE A GOOD
CHANCE OF WINNING.

15:37.169 --> 15:41.573
AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME IT
MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A STRONG

15:41.573 --> 15:45.044
COMPETITOR WORKING FOR YOU THAN
AGAINST YOU.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.579
>> I LIKE IT.

15:47.579 --> 15:56.622
>> HEY EVERYBODY.

15:56.622 --> 16:02.428
IT'S TIME FOR THE H.O.H. EXESH.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.064
GET READY TO EXET.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.332
>> NOT ME STILL SITTING DOWN.

16:06.332 --> 16:10.302
>> I NEED TO WIN H.O.H. THIS
WEEK TO ENSURE I'M SAFE.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.138
I DON'T TRUST NONE OF THESE
PEOPLE IN HERE.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.208
I HAVE TO WIN THIS BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THESE

16:16.208 --> 16:20.346
PEOPLE MIGHT TAKE A SHOT AT ME.

16:20.346 --> 16:25.084
>> THIS IS A VERY HIGH STAKES
H.O.H. BECAUSE IT IS JUST THE

16:25.084 --> 16:28.921
COOKOUT VERSUS OURSELVES AND
WHOEVER WINS IS GOING TO HAVE TO

16:28.921 --> 16:32.591
BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEND A
MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT HOME, SO

16:32.591 --> 16:34.360
NO ONE IS SAFE.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.364
AND HAVING POWER IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN EVER.

16:38.364 --> 16:42.000
>> SINCE I WON THE H.O.H. DURING
THE DOUBLE EVICTION I CAN'T PLAY

16:42.000 --> 16:45.838
IN THIS ONE BUT I'M REALLY
HOPING THAT WHOEVER WINS DOESN'T

16:45.838 --> 16:48.674
HAVE ME HIGH ON THEIR LIST OF
TARGETS.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.943
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST
MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT TO WALK

16:50.943 --> 16:52.578
INTO THAT JURY HOUSE.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.881
>> WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING NICEY
NICE ALL THE WAY UP TO THIS

16:55.881 --> 16:58.951
POINT BUT HEY, IF WE HAVE TO
HAVE A FOOD FIGHT AT THE COOKOUT

16:58.951 --> 17:02.955
LET'S GET IT ON AND POPPING
BECAUSE NOW IT IS DOWN TO US.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.624
IT'S EVERY MAN OR WOMAN FOR
THEMSELVES.

17:11.063 --> 17:16.034
>> AS BB COMICS WEEK TELEPHONES
OUR SUPERHEROES FIND THEMSELVES

17:16.034 --> 17:24.510
TRAP INNED LAYER OF THE EVIL
SUPERVILAN THE CLUCKSSTER.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.211
>> YOU'RE ALL OUT OF CLUCK.

17:26.211 --> 17:34.586
NOW THAT I HAVE TRAPPED YOU IN
MY ELECTROMAGNETIC CAGES, I HAVE

17:34.586 --> 17:37.089
HATCHED AN EXTREMELY MANIACAL
PLAN.

17:37.089 --> 17:43.328
I'M GOING TO TURN ALL FIVE OF
YOU INTO CHICKENS AT THE STROKE

17:43.328 --> 17:44.997
OF MIDNIGHT.

17:44.997 --> 17:51.904
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'LL NEVER FLY
THE COUP, UNLESS YOU CAN DO THE

17:51.904 --> 17:52.671
IMPOSSIBLE.

17:52.671 --> 17:55.407
GRAB AN EGG IN FRONT OF YOUR
CAGE.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.776
SQUEEZE IT THROUGH THE WIRE
MAIZ.

17:57.776 --> 18:03.949
ROLL IT DOWN THE RAMP, KNOCKING
OVER ALL THREE POWER LEVERS

18:03.949 --> 18:07.219
KILLING THE POWER AND ALLOWING
YOU TO ESCAPE.

18:07.219 --> 18:12.991
NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

18:12.991 --> 18:24.736
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I'VE
GOT SOME CLUCKING TO DO GOOD

18:24.736 --> 18:28.974
LUCK GUYS.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.210
>> THAT'S HARD.

18:31.210 --> 18:35.881
>> UP UNTIL THIS POINT I HAVE
NOTHING ON MY RESUME IN TERMS OF

18:35.881 --> 18:39.351
COMP WINS AND I WOULD LOVE TO
SEE PICTURES OF MY MOM, MY DAD

18:39.351 --> 18:42.821
AND GET THAT LETTER FROM MY
FAMILY.

18:42.821 --> 18:45.691
SO I WANT TO GO FOR THIS.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.026
>> YOU GUYS ARE DOING WELL.

18:48.026 --> 18:52.364
>> I KNOW YOU SEE ME THROWN
COMPETITION AFTER COMPETITION

18:52.364 --> 18:53.632
AFTER COMPETITION.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.768
HOWEVER BECAUSE WE HAVE FINALLY
REACHED FINAL SIX IT IS TIME FOR

18:56.768 --> 18:59.004
THE THROWING OF THE COMPETITION
TO FEAST.

18:59.004 --> 19:03.842
AND THIS IS THE GAME THE COOKOUT
HAS TO START TARGETING ITS OWN

19:03.842 --> 19:15.387
MEMBERS AND THE ONLY WAY TO
SECURE YOUR SAFETY IS TO WIN.

19:15.387 --> 19:19.224
>> CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

19:19.224 --> 19:25.230
>> TAKE YOUR TIME YOU GUYS, YOU
GOT THIS.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.465
>> THAT'S OKAY.

19:26.465 --> 19:30.536
>> IN THIS COMPETITION WE HAVE
TO STICK OUR HANDS THROUGH THIS

19:30.536 --> 19:34.172
CHICKEN WIRE WALL AND MOVE THE
EGGS THROUGH THE MAIZ INTO OUR

19:34.172 --> 19:35.340
COOP.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.110
ONCE WE GET AN EGG IN OUR COOP
WE CAN ROLL THE EGG DOWN THE

19:38.110 --> 19:40.979
RAMP AND TRY TO KNOCK OVER ONE
OF THE LEVERS.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.116
THE FIRST PERSON TO KNOCK OVER
ALL THREE LEVERS ESCAPES THEIR

19:44.116 --> 19:50.389
COOP AND BECOME THE THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.191
THAT'S OKAY, AZAH.

19:53.191 --> 19:55.227
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

19:55.227 --> 20:00.098
>> IT COULD TAKE FOREVER TO GET
THIS DAMN EGG FROM THE BOTTOM

20:00.098 --> 20:01.333
THROUGH THE MAIZ.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.536
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE MY
SWEET ASS TIME BECAUSE I DON'T

20:04.536 --> 20:05.737
WANT TO DROP IT.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.906
BECAUSE IF I DROP IT IT IS JUST
GOING TO SPLAT ALL OVER THE

20:07.906 --> 20:18.584
GROUND AND I WILL HAVE TO START
AGAIN.

20:18.584 --> 20:19.618
>> THAT'S OKAY.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.387
>> THESE HANDS ARE MEANT FOR
BASKETBALL, NOT EGGS.

20:22.387 --> 20:26.992
THE ONLY THING THESE HANDS DO
WITH EGGS IS SCRAMBLE THEM.

20:26.992 --> 20:31.229
>> IF I CAN'T WIN THIS
COMPETITION I WANT KYLAND TO

20:31.229 --> 20:32.431
WIN.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.566
JUST TO SAY I WAS THE FINAL TWO
WITH KYLAND KNOWN AS THE WE

20:34.566 --> 20:46.578
HAVE, IF KYLAND WINS I SHOULD BE
SITTING PRETTY.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.614
>> KEEP IT UP.

20:48.614 --> 20:55.220
>> I SEEN THIS WIRE, I SEE THESE
EGGS, I SEE THE TINY FINGERS, I

20:55.220 --> 20:57.823
CAN GET THESE FINGERS AROUND
ANYTHING, NOT A PROBLEM.

20:57.823 --> 21:02.561
HOWEVER GETTING MY EGG DOWN THIS
RAMP TO KNOCK DOWN THE LEVER IS

21:02.561 --> 21:12.604
THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF
THIS COMPETITION FOR ME.

21:12.604 --> 21:23.615
THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF
THIS COMPETITION FOR ME.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.217
>> THE EASIEST PART OF THIS
COMPETITION IS ET GOING THE EGG.

21:25.217 --> 21:32.024
I APPROXIMATE FLYING, MY FINGERS
ARE DOING AN AWESOME JOB.

21:32.024 --> 21:36.728
>> IF THIS RAMP THAT IS REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY MESSING ME UP T

21:36.728 --> 21:41.900
DOESN'T MATTER HOW SLOW I TRY TO
DRIVE MY EGG, IT KEEPS ROLLING

21:41.900 --> 21:46.571
FASTER AND FASTER AND I CAN'T
SEEM TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL.

21:46.571 --> 21:50.375
>> OKAY.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.243
>> YOU SEE ME?

21:51.243 --> 21:53.979
>> I SEE YOU, SLOW AND STEADY
BIG D.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.515
>> HERE'S THE TRICKY PART, OKAY.

21:56.515 --> 22:08.527
DON'T BE STRONG, DON'T BE-- OH,
DON'T BE STRONG OKAY.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.797
>> OKAY, ROLLING ALREADY, WHOA.

22:11.797 --> 22:12.931
CHILOUT.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.533
>> I'M TALKING TO THESE EGGS
LETTING THEM KNOW, TAKE YOUR

22:14.533 --> 22:17.769
TIME, WE DO NOT HAVE TO RUSH.

22:17.769 --> 22:18.970
>> CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

22:18.970 --> 22:23.308
>> IF I FELT LIKE THEY WEREN'T
READY TO SHOW UP THE ONE WAY.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.077
>> YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.913
THEN I'M GOING TO BRING THEM
BACK AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY

22:27.913 --> 22:31.216
AND THEN CHECK THEIR WARDROBE,
CHECK THEIR HAIR, CHECK THEIR

22:31.216 --> 22:38.557
MAKEUP AND THEN I WILL PUT THEM
BACK OUT THERE ON THE RUNWAY.

22:38.557 --> 22:45.097
WE'RE GOING TO WALK THEY WILL
POSE AN HILT THAT LEVERAGE.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.365
>> CONGRATS BIG D, YOU KNOCKED
DOWN YOUR FIRST LEVER.

22:47.365 --> 22:53.638
>> THE EGGS ARE LISTEN TO ME, I
AM THE FIRST TO SCORE ONLY TWO

22:53.638 --> 22:58.877
MORE LEVERS AND I AM FINALLY
H.O.H. IN THIS HOUSE AND CAN I

22:58.877 --> 23:04.349
FINALLY GET SOME POWER.

23:04.349 --> 23:14.392
>> STEADY GUY, KEEP IT UP.

23:14.392 --> 23:21.733
>> STEADY GUY, KEEP IT UP.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.869
MORE ANMORE EGGS ARE CRACKING.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.671
>> I REALIZE THAT CAREFULLY THE
EGGS FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER

23:26.671 --> 23:30.208
SAVES ME A LOT OF TIME, IT'S
RISKY BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S WORTH

23:30.208 --> 23:33.011
IT AND THE FACT THAT I CAN GET
THE EGGS AROUND THE MAIZ AND ON

23:33.011 --> 23:38.116
TO THE PLANE, THE FASTER CAN I
PRACTICE HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS

23:38.116 --> 23:52.330
WILE THE EGG DOWN THIS CRAZY
PLANK WITHIN KYLAND KNOCKS DOWN

23:52.330 --> 23:57.002

THAT KYLAND IS DOING PRETTY WELL

24:02.774 --> 24:06.978
AND I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT,
BECAUSE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

24:06.978 --> 24:12.350
KYLAND, HANNAH AND I MADE A
FINAL THREE DEAL.

24:12.350 --> 24:15.020
>> OKAY.

24:15.020 --> 24:29.968

TRUST X TO CHEAT YOU AFTER SIX,

24:29.968 --> 24:34.940
YOU ARE JEOPARDIZEING.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.677

ONE OF YOU.

24:39.711 --> 24:43.515

27:08.360 --> 27:15.934
>> OKAY, TAKE YOUR TIME.

27:15.934 --> 27:19.437
>> BIG D KNOCKED OFFER THE
SECOND LEVER, I'M INCLINED TO

27:19.437 --> 27:21.740
SIT BACK AND LET HIM TAKE THE
WIN EVEN THOUGH HE WOULD BE

27:21.740 --> 27:24.676
TAKING THAT FIRST SHOT WITHIN
THE COOKOUT, PRIMMEE PRETTY SURE

27:24.676 --> 27:35.754
IT WON'T BE AIMED AT ME, GO BIG
D GO.

27:35.754 --> 27:36.855
>> SWEET.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.024
>> NO, I AM GETTING VERY
FRUSTRATED WITH THE DAMN EGGS.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.658
>> IT IS OKAY.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.595
I AM ABOUT TO GIVE THEM A
WHOOPING TO BE HONEST BECAUSE

27:43.595 --> 27:50.702
THEY'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME
FOCUS, LISTEN MY VOICE, WE WILL

27:50.702 --> 28:00.345
GET THERE AND WIN THESE LEVERS
AND WIN THIS H.O.H. YES.

28:00.345 --> 28:11.756
>> AZAH HAS KNOCKED DOWN HER
FIRST LEVER ARE YOU FINE.

28:11.756 --> 28:16.561
>> RIGHT NOW I'M WAITING FOR BIG
D TO TAKE THIS HOME, MY BEST BET

28:16.561 --> 28:26.604
IS JUST GOING TO BE TO GO AHEAD
AND DO IT AND TAKE HOME THE WIN.

28:26.604 --> 28:34.646
IS JUST GOING TO BE TO GO AHEAD
AND DO IT AND TAKE HOME THE WIN.

28:34.646 --> 28:38.683
>> CON GRTS.

28:38.683 --> 28:39.717
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

28:39.717 --> 28:51.062
CONGRATULATIONS, ARE YOU THE NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.330
>> WOW.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.198
>> PERFECT.

28:53.198 --> 28:54.399
>> IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

28:54.399 --> 29:04.442
HAVING THREE IN ONE SUMMER, IT
IS PRETTY COOL I JUST SHAKE MY

29:04.442 --> 29:12.350
HAVING THREE IN ONE SUMMER, IT
IS PRETTY COOL I JUST SHAKE MY

29:12.350 --> 29:16.254
HEAD I JUST HAD IT, IT WAS RIGHT
THERE, I'M HAPPY FOR KYLAND AND

29:16.254 --> 29:22.694
IF ANYONE NEEDS A WIN I'M OKAY
WITH KYLAND WINNING BUT I'M JUST

29:22.694 --> 29:22.961
BUMMED

29:32.737 --> 29:35.707
>> GOOD JOB.

29:35.707 --> 29:36.141
>> I NEED A SHOWER.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.809
I NEED A SHOWER.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.377
>> OH MAN.

29:39.377 --> 29:43.581
I'M THE NEW H.O.H. AND IT'S A
COMPLICATED PLACE TO BE.

29:43.581 --> 29:49.521
I'M GUARANTEED A SPOT IF THE
FINAL FIVE, A DREAM COME TRUE.

29:49.521 --> 29:56.227
BEING THE FIRST PERSON TO TAKE A
SHOT AT THE SIX AND MEAN IT.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.196
>> I'M THE KING AROUND HERE.

29:58.196 --> 30:01.032
>> THIS IS THE HEAVIEST IT HAS
BEEN ALL SEASON.

30:01.032 --> 30:03.902
>> NOW YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING
WE AIN'T HAD TO DO.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.838
>> I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT
KYLAND BEING H.O.H.

30:06.838 --> 30:12.243
BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE A DEAL TO
WORK WITH EACH OTHER TILL THE

30:12.243 --> 30:12.877
END.

30:12.877 --> 30:15.513
I NEED KYLAND IN THIS GAME.

30:15.513 --> 30:21.519
CUZ NIBBLES IS GOING TO TRY TO
TAKE ME OUT.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.454
>> .

30:23.454 --> 30:25.490
>> I DIDN'T EVEN GET A ROOM.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.693
>> EVEN THOUGH I JUST THREW
KYLAND UP ON THE BLOCK I AM

30:28.693 --> 30:33.031
CONFIDENT THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO
SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH HIM AND

30:33.031 --> 30:36.734
THE TWO VOTES HE NEEDS TO TARGET
WHOMEVER IN THIS HOUSE WILL COME

30:36.734 --> 30:39.804
FROM MYSELF AND TIFFANY.

30:39.804 --> 30:48.546
SO FOR THAT REASON NEITHER ONE
OF US SHOULD SEE THE BLOCK THIS

30:48.546 --> 30:49.113
WEEK.

30:49.113 --> 30:55.286
>> JUST ONE EGG, BIG D.

30:55.286 --> 30:58.523
>> I CAN'T WIN IN THIS HOUSE, I
AM JUST SO FRUSTRATED.

30:58.523 --> 31:03.194
I DON'T WANT TO SKATE BY, I WANT
TO BE A THREAT.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.496
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS.

31:05.496 --> 31:07.465
>> I'M SORRY.

31:07.465 --> 31:07.966
>> SORRY.

31:07.966 --> 31:08.366
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.601
>> THANK YOU.

31:09.601 --> 31:18.309
>> JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW
AM I GOING TO CONTINUE IN THIS

31:18.309 --> 31:24.115
GAME, HOW AM I GOING TO FIGHT
FOR MY POSITION.

31:24.115 --> 31:25.216
>> WHOOO.

31:25.216 --> 31:31.256
>> WHAT DO I HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT, THAT IS THE QUESTION.

31:31.256 --> 31:36.327
>> YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.

31:36.327 --> 31:41.432
>> I CAN'T, THAT'S-- I AM NOT
GOING TO CRY IN THIS GAME IT IS

31:41.432 --> 31:42.533
VERY DIFFICULT.

31:42.533 --> 31:47.772
>> I KNOW HOW BADLY DEREK WANTS
TO WIN A COMPETITION.

31:47.772 --> 31:50.208
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.510
>> I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

31:52.510 --> 31:53.511
>> AND NOW WE'RE HERE.

31:53.511 --> 31:56.481
SO I HAVE TO MAKE A REALLY TOUGH
DECISION.

31:56.481 --> 32:01.986
AT A MOMENT WHERE IT IS TRULY AN
INDIVIDUAL GAME FOR ALL SIX OF

32:01.986 --> 32:03.221
US.

32:03.221 --> 32:08.226
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I AM GOING
TO GO, TO WALK INTO A FINAL WITH

32:08.226 --> 32:11.062
NO H.O.H. WINS.

32:11.062 --> 32:22.740
I'M JUST SITTING THERE FOR FUN.

32:22.740 --> 32:23.941
>> THIS IS FUNNY.

32:23.941 --> 32:27.645
I LITERALLY JUST SOLIDIFIED A
FINAL TWO WITH THIS MAN BEFORE

32:27.645 --> 32:32.216
THE H.O.H. COMPETITION AND NOW
HE WINS H.O.H.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.419
LIKE TIMING IS EVERYTHING.

32:34.419 --> 32:37.388
HOPEFULLY KYLAND TARGETS TIFFANY
THIS WEEK SO THAT WAY I DON'T

32:37.388 --> 32:43.728
HAVE TO GET ANY BLOOD ON MY
HANDS, COME ON NOW, I LOVE THIS

32:43.728 --> 32:44.228
GAME.

32:44.228 --> 32:44.929
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

32:44.929 --> 32:51.502
>> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT.

32:51.502 --> 32:58.376
>> I I PUT TIFFANY AND-- CHADA
CAN WIN VETO.

32:58.376 --> 33:06.718
>> IT WILL BE EASIEST IF YOU WIN
CUZ I THINK-- I WANT TO AVOID

33:06.718 --> 33:08.519
THAT, AND THIS IS THE FIRST
STEP.

33:08.519 --> 33:12.023
>> AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE TO
WIN.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.158
>> I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU
KNOW, THAT OBVIOUSLY I TOLD

33:14.158 --> 33:15.993
EVERYONE, I'M NOT TELLING
ANYBODY ANYTHING.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.072
>> HELLO.

33:28.072 --> 33:29.240
>> WHEN ARE YOU IN THIS
POSITION, I ALWAYS WANT IT, AND

33:29.240 --> 33:32.210
THEN WHEN YOU GET T I WILL BE
LIKE I'M TBLAD IT'S NOT ME.

33:32.210 --> 33:40.218
>> I NEED KYLAND TO SEE THAT
THERE ARE BIGGER TARGETS IN THIS

33:40.218 --> 33:42.453
HOUSE, JUST THIS CASE HE MAY BE
LOOKING AT ME.

33:42.453 --> 33:45.523
XAVIER WILL WIN THIS GAME IF HE
CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.658
>> I WOULD EVEN VOTE FOR HIM.

33:47.658 --> 33:52.597
>> I AM JUST HOPING THAT KYLAND
STAYS TRUE TO THIS FINAL DEAL

33:52.597 --> 33:53.898
BETWEEN HIM, HANNAH AND MYSELF.

33:53.898 --> 33:57.502
>> I WANT US TO HAVE OUR FINAL
THREE, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

33:57.502 --> 34:03.074
I'M STILL COMMITTED TO OUR
AGREEMENT SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE

34:03.074 --> 34:09.514
IF YOU ARE STILL HERE WHEN YOU
DO.

34:09.514 --> 34:17.255
>> DO YOU HAVE A PREFERRED FINAL
FOUR?

34:17.255 --> 34:18.956
WITHIN THE FOUR SAY TOSS UP.

34:18.956 --> 34:24.595
I FEEL LIKE X AND BIG D SHOULD
GO FIRST.

34:24.595 --> 34:33.538
>> X I WILL LOSE BUT I WOULD
LIKE TO COMPETE AGAINST YOU.

34:33.538 --> 34:43.047
>> I WAS THINKING WHERE IS KY
AND HOW DOES HE FEEL ABOUT ME

34:43.047 --> 34:45.383
MOVING FORWARD.

34:45.383 --> 34:48.586
>> I HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY
DECREASED POSSIBILITY OF BEING

34:48.586 --> 34:51.489
SAFE NEXT WEEK.

34:51.489 --> 34:56.594
>> IF CLAIRE IS GOING TO SIT IN
THERE AND TELL EVERYBODY TO VOTE

34:56.594 --> 34:58.229
FOR X.

34:58.229 --> 35:04.168
>> AND EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T
CONVINCE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR X,

35:04.168 --> 35:07.305
HE STILL WINS.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.606
>> THAT MAKES SENSE.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.976
>> TIFFANY IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.544
XAVIER IS AN INSANE COMPETITOR.

35:13.544 --> 35:16.814
BUT THEN ALSO I KNOW HE'S BEEN
THROWING COMPETITIONS.

35:16.814 --> 35:21.419
HE HAS A SKILL SET THAT WE STILL
HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE PO

35:21.419 --> 35:26.657
TECHNOLOGIES OF YET.

35:26.657 --> 35:30.561
SO ANYONE SITTING NEXT TO HIM
WILL HAVE AN UPHILL BATTLE.

35:30.561 --> 35:33.798
HOWEVER I THINK TIFFANY IS ALSO
AN INCREDIBLE COMPETITOR AND

35:33.798 --> 35:44.842
SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE DIFFICULT
TO BEAT.

35:44.842 --> 35:45.810
>> HEY KY.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.211
>> HEY.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.813
>> HOW ARE YOU?

35:48.813 --> 35:50.081
>> I'M WELL.

35:50.081 --> 35:53.284
>> I THINK I WAS ABLE TO SMOOTH
THINGS OVER WITH KYLAND AS BEST

35:53.284 --> 35:56.687
AS I COULD BUT I HONESTLY DON'T
KNOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TRUST THE

35:56.687 --> 35:58.556
GUY WITH A TEN FOOT POLE.

35:58.556 --> 35:59.290
>> SO THIS IS WHERE I START
PITCHING.

35:59.290 --> 36:00.525
>> YEAH.

36:00.525 --> 36:02.793
>> HOPEFULLY HE KNOW THERE ARE
BIGGER TARGETS IN THIS GAME THAN

36:02.793 --> 36:03.961
LITTLE ME.

36:03.961 --> 36:08.699
>> WHAT I CAN OFFER YOU THIS
WEEK IS YOU NEED TWO VOTES TO

36:08.699 --> 36:09.834
SEND YOUR TARGET HOME.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.170
SO IF I AM NOT ON THE BLOCK,
THEN I WILL VOTE HOWEVER YOU

36:13.170 --> 36:17.074
WOULD LIKE ME TO VOTE BECAUSE I
TRUST YOUR REASONING AND I'M

36:17.074 --> 36:19.844
WILLING TO HOP ON BOARD AND MAKE
THAT HAPPEN.

36:19.844 --> 36:24.515
>> WHAT ARE THE OFFERS AVAILABLE
FOR YOU AND I IN THE SCENARIO

36:24.515 --> 36:27.952
WHERE YOU DO GO UP, EITHER AT
THE BEGINNING OR REPLACEMENT,

36:27.952 --> 36:33.024
BUT IN A WAY THAT I ENSURE YOU
DON'T GO HOME.

36:33.024 --> 36:37.528
>> I THINK THAT THIS
CONVERSATION IS ALL ABOUT SEEING

36:37.528 --> 36:39.130
HOW LOYAL I AM.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.566
KYLAND IS AN INFORMATION
COLLECTOR.

36:41.566 --> 36:45.002
HE FEELS MOST COMFORTABLE WHEN
HE FEELS LIKE HE HOLDS ALL OF

36:45.002 --> 36:47.638
YOUR CARDS, SO THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED TO GIVE HIM.

36:47.638 --> 36:53.277
I NEED KYLAND TO CONTINUE TO
TRUST ME IN THIS GAME BECAUSE

36:53.277 --> 36:55.813
OTHER THAN TIFFANY, I HAVE NO
ONE ELSE.

36:55.813 --> 37:04.121
>> SO IF I AM ON THE BLOCK NEXT
TO X, AZAH AND BIG D, I JUST

37:04.121 --> 37:07.124
DON'T SEE HOW I WOULD BE ABLE TO
STAY.

37:07.124 --> 37:13.831
FOR ME THERE IS ONE PERSON THAT
I FEEL LIKE I AM INEVITABLY

37:13.831 --> 37:16.567
GOING TO-- AND THAT PERSON IS X.

37:16.567 --> 37:23.074
SO IF I WERE IN YOUR POSITION
THIS WEEK, X WOULD BE PIE

37:23.074 --> 37:24.241
TARGET.

37:24.241 --> 37:27.979
APP I'M SERIOUS ABOUT ME,
TIFFANY IN THE END IN THE EVENT

37:27.979 --> 37:30.281
WE MAKE FINAL FOUR WITH ONE
OTHER PERSON, I WILL TAKE OU.

37:30.281 --> 37:33.017
>> I MADE DEALS WITH A FEW
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF

37:33.017 --> 37:34.185
THIS GAME.

37:34.185 --> 37:40.224
HOWEVER WE ARE APPROACHING A
POINT IN THE GAME WHERE LINES

37:40.224 --> 37:43.060
MAY HAVE TO BE DRAWN.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.363
>> THANK YOU.

37:45.363 --> 37:46.864
>> LET ME PONDER FOR A MINUTE.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.567
THIS IS NOT A DECISION I TAKE
LIGHTLY

38:01.012 --> 38:06.450
>> RIGHT NOW THERE ARE
TWO-- TRYING TO STICK THINGS OUT

38:06.450 --> 38:12.923
WITH TIFFANY AND CHADA OR I WORK
WITH XAVIER, WHATEVER DECISION I

38:12.923 --> 38:17.495
MAKE, IT'S THE FIRST TIME ANY
DEFINITIVE LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN

38:17.495 --> 38:21.699
WITHIN THE COOKOUT AND EITHER
WAY, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BREAK

38:21.699 --> 38:22.767
HEARTS.

38:22.767 --> 38:23.701
MINE INCLUDED.

38:23.701 --> 38:24.468
>> HEY EVERYONE.

38:24.468 --> 38:34.512
TIME FOR THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

38:34.512 --> 38:48.693
TIME FOR THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

38:48.693 --> 38:52.096
>> THIS IS THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

38:52.096 --> 38:56.434
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

38:56.434 --> 38:59.670
TWO HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

38:59.670 --> 39:04.775
IN MY NOM NATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUEST I'M

39:04.775 --> 39:06.010
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

39:06.010 --> 39:09.847
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATION AND THEIR FACES

39:09.847 --> 39:13.317
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

39:13.317 --> 39:23.360
THE FIRST HOIS GUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS-- .

39:23.360 --> 39:31.602
THE FIRST HOIS GUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS-- .

39:31.602 --> 39:41.645
>> THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS I HAVE NOMINATED

39:41.645 --> 39:47.685
>> THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS I HAVE NOMINATED

39:47.685 --> 39:51.222
YOU, TIFFANY AND YOU HANNAH.

39:51.222 --> 39:55.426
THIS DECISION HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY SORT OF LOSS OF RESPECT

39:55.426 --> 39:56.660
OR LOSS OF LOVE.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.796
IT'S SIMPLY A LOSS OF TRUST.

39:58.796 --> 40:03.200
CHADDA I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE
PERSON MOST LIKELY TO USE THE

40:03.200 --> 40:04.535
VETO THIS WEEK.

40:04.535 --> 40:07.505
SO I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT IF
YOU DID IT WOULD BE ON YOURSELF,

40:07.505 --> 40:14.345
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.948
>> TIFFANY HAS REPEATEDLY OVER
THE COURSE OF THIS GAME DONE

40:17.948 --> 40:21.452
THINGS AND SAID THINGS TO BREAK
MY TRUST IN HER.

40:21.452 --> 40:27.691
SHE IS JUST NOT SOMEONE THAT I
FEEL SAFE HAVING IN THIS GAME.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.093
AM.

40:29.093 --> 40:34.899
>> AFTER FOUR LONG WEEKS XAVIER
HAS NOT BEEN NOMINATED.

40:34.899 --> 40:39.170
TIFFANY IS ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST
THREAT TO MY PERSONAL GAME.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.206
TIFFANY FINALLY BEING NOMINATED,
THIS IS A CHANCE TO GET HER OUT

40:42.206 --> 40:47.611
AND BRING ME ONE STEP CLOSER TO
$750,000.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.414
>> I'M SHOCKED AND I'M SAD.

40:50.414 --> 40:54.618
THE FACT THAT I AM UP NEXT TO MY
NUMBER ONE ALLY WITHIN THE

40:54.618 --> 40:57.421
COOKOUT,-AND-JUST WITHIN THIS
GAME, ABSOLUTELY SUCKS.

40:57.421 --> 40:58.522
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

40:58.522 --> 41:02.092
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO
GUARANTEE MY SAFETY THIS WEEK

41:02.092 --> 41:05.863
AND THAT IS TO WIN THE VETO
COMPETITION.

41:05.863 --> 41:09.400
>> KY IS THE SMARTEST IDIOT I
HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.634
WE HAD A WHOLE DEAL.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.537
YOU DON'T TRUST ME CUZ YOU
SHOULDN'T.

41:13.537 --> 41:14.738
AND THAT'S FINE.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.174
BUT YOU DON'T SUPPOSED TO KNOW
IT YOU SUPPOSED TO LET ME STAY

41:17.174 --> 41:18.342
HERE.

41:18.342 --> 41:20.578
NOW I GOT TO GO OUT HERE AND
FIGHT FOR MY LIFE AND WIN THE

41:20.578 --> 41:24.415
POWER OF VETO AND MAKE YOU
NOMINATE SOMEBODY ELSE, SO I CAN

41:24.415 --> 41:27.685
WIN H.O.H. NEXT WEEK AND SEND
YOUR BEHIND TO THE JURY.

41:27.685 --> 41:30.421
>> Announcer: WHO WILL WIN
THE POWER OF VETO.

41:30.421 --> 41:34.892
AND WILL IT BE USED SO SAVE
