00:01.431 --> 00:03.312
Do you mind if I give you a kiss?

00:03.374 --> 00:05.375
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

00:05.429 --> 00:06.882
I'm saving myself for marriage.

00:06.937 --> 00:09.585
The path you are choosing isn't easy

00:09.905 --> 00:11.679
I want what you and Kerry have?

00:11.702 --> 00:13.554
Do you even recognize me anymore?

00:13.601 --> 00:15.548
Am I even the same person
that you meet in Los Angeles?

00:15.554 --> 00:17.296
I'm not even the same person

00:17.397 --> 00:21.784
When Kerry is gone, you are not
thinking about if he with is a girl.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.228
Kerry is definitely getting
a lot of attention.

00:24.323 --> 00:25.815
Even though he has a ring on his finger.

00:25.862 --> 00:29.260
Just because there is a goaly,
doesn't mean you don't play soccer.

00:36.157 --> 00:38.976
so is there anything trying
to change in our workout?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.640
No, I think everything is going well.

00:40.671 --> 00:43.561
- Good.
- I mean like actual results.

00:43.992 --> 00:45.614
I tell you, your face is getting leaner

00:45.652 --> 00:46.700
not that it needed to.

00:46.863 --> 00:50.902
Yeah, remember that time in
college when you called me fat?

00:50.981 --> 00:52.777
- I did not call you fat.
- You called me fat.

00:52.789 --> 00:53.288
I would never.

00:53.299 --> 00:54.801
You said I was puffy.

00:55.018 --> 00:57.298
- You said I looked puffy
- Because you asked if you did.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.483
I will never forget that.

01:00.367 --> 01:02.283
- Ah!
- It's Jessica.

01:02.381 --> 01:04.170
Now be nice.

01:04.328 --> 01:05.662
Hello.

01:05.757 --> 01:06.423
Jessica?

01:06.643 --> 01:08.591
Jackson, what are you doing?

01:08.654 --> 01:11.792
I am actually chillin'
with my cousin, Alexander

01:11.894 --> 01:13.586
You're actually on speaker right now.

01:13.587 --> 01:14.918
Hello Jessica!

01:14.919 --> 01:16.939
Hey girl. I've heard about you.

01:17.005 --> 01:20.236
Oh you have. Well I heard about you, too.

01:20.283 --> 01:22.986
- We'll need to get together.
- I would love to.

01:23.018 --> 01:24.461
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

01:26.391 --> 01:29.359
Alicia and I are having a birthday party, you’ll have to come.

Oh nice. Okay.

01:30.580 --> 01:31.746
you should come, too.

Awesome. That sounds great.

01:40.697 --> 01:42.236
Oh my God!

01:42.306 --> 01:43.344
That was Jessica.

01:43.416 --> 01:45.475
I guess now you're stuck with me.
I'm actually coming

01:45.482 --> 01:47.940
I guess I'm calling.

01:48.336 --> 01:49.752
Funny that she called.

01:49.753 --> 01:51.836
We had a studio session.

01:51.837 --> 01:54.419
She was making me more confident

01:54.420 --> 01:56.544
making you more confident?

01:56.545 --> 01:59.461
At I point my confidence was high.

01:59.462 --> 02:01.669
We were groove in together and I

02:01.670 --> 02:03.876
said do you mind if I kiss you?

02:03.877 --> 02:04.918
She said no.

02:04.919 --> 02:06.085
Oh my god!

02:06.086 --> 02:09.168
I was like oh my god.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.669
Like the first time ever that's

02:10.669 --> 02:11.876
happened in your life.

02:11.877 --> 02:13.419
Not true.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.461
But it's the first time in a while.

02:15.462 --> 02:16.876
She didn't say one more thing

02:16.877 --> 02:18.876
she went into the story about

02:18.877 --> 02:20.876
she likes to take it slow.

02:20.877 --> 02:21.211
Clearly.

02:21.212 --> 02:23.168
She got into the topic of she

02:23.200 --> 02:26.213
was, said she was a virgin.

02:26.278 --> 02:27.183
Oh!

02:27.246 --> 02:28.605
- Which is cool.
- Yes.

02:28.637 --> 02:29.871
It's just like something

02:29.965 --> 02:31.673
You don't hear that every day.

02:31.730 --> 02:35.104
But I like hugging my
girl and, like you know

02:35.111 --> 02:37.517
sometimes one thing leads to another.

02:37.540 --> 02:38.377
I got it.

02:39.697 --> 02:41.280
Won't go into it but you know

02:41.289 --> 02:44.579
seems like a bit of a change.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.829
That's just your sisterly

02:46.830 --> 02:48.537
instincts coming out which, you

02:48.538 --> 02:49.579
know, piss me off sometimes but

Are you excited Kerry is back

03:26.059 --> 03:27.791
yeah, it's good.

03:27.858 --> 03:28.643
It's an adjustment, but.

03:28.784 --> 03:29.744
Yeah?

03:29.745 --> 03:30.783
It's like, he's used to,

03:30.784 --> 03:31.702
like, being on the road and

03:31.703 --> 03:32.783
playing music, and then it's

03:32.784 --> 03:35.349
like, you help me with dinner and...

03:35.392 --> 03:36.474
Right.

03:36.779 --> 03:38.802
- Marriage, right?
- Marriage!

03:38.839 --> 03:40.810
So we have a five year
anniversary coming up

03:40.892 --> 03:42.786
and I got us a hotel room.

03:42.883 --> 03:44.372
Good idea, ray.

03:45.076 --> 03:46.694
But dating.

03:46.793 --> 03:47.668
I'm dating, yeah.

03:48.066 --> 03:49.024
That's a thing.

03:49.031 --> 03:50.031
So, Jackson.

03:50.515 --> 03:51.913
Have y'all hung out?

03:51.929 --> 03:54.728
Yes, we have.

03:54.814 --> 03:58.382
He may have tried to kiss me, and...

03:58.586 --> 03:59.984
What do you mean he tried?

04:00.062 --> 04:01.182
He asked.

04:01.211 --> 04:02.421
- It was like...
- And you were like, no,

04:02.499 --> 04:03.265
I'm not ready for that?

04:03.304 --> 04:04.885
Yeah, I was just like, ah...

04:04.955 --> 04:06.378
You're physically
attracted to him, right?

04:07.259 --> 04:09.087
Yeah, he's cute. Do I have eyes?

04:09.094 --> 04:10.218
I'm looking for something, like,

04:10.265 --> 04:11.767
serious and, you know, I'm about

04:11.774 --> 04:14.031
to turn 30 and I don't have the

04:14.093 --> 04:16.007
husband and kids and the life

04:16.029 --> 04:17.529
that I thought I would, but I'm

04:17.543 --> 04:18.911
looking for what you have you know?

04:19.067 --> 04:20.772
I love being a wife and mom,

04:20.826 --> 04:23.522
but trust me married life
is no fairytale, either.

04:23.627 --> 04:24.793
I don't know.

04:24.794 --> 04:26.585
Who knows, maybe Jackson is that person.

04:26.586 --> 04:28.335
You'll just have to

04:28.336 --> 04:28.836
kiss him and find out.

04:28.836 --> 04:29.669
Just all the kisses.

04:42.205 --> 04:44.295
What up?

04:44.374 --> 04:45.374
Good to see you, man.

04:46.131 --> 04:47.395
You go antiquing on the road?

04:47.483 --> 04:48.443
Heck yeah.

04:48.568 --> 04:50.318
For a farm truck, it's not so bad.

04:50.483 --> 04:52.166
Wait, this is the real test.

04:53.007 --> 04:53.966
I ain't tried yet.

04:54.319 --> 04:55.483
It works.

04:55.523 --> 04:57.126
- Heck yeah.
- How was the road?

04:57.146 --> 04:57.854
It was good.

04:57.892 --> 04:58.724
Glad to be back.

04:58.740 --> 04:59.740
Yeah.

04:59.834 --> 05:02.148
Being gone as much as I've been,
you miss so many, like, firsts.

05:02.215 --> 05:03.201
Like the first time he crawls

05:03.208 --> 05:04.624
and steps and says Dada.

05:04.695 --> 05:08.971
How's Rachel with you leaving and?

05:10.378 --> 05:12.085
You know, I'm gone probably

05:12.086 --> 05:13.460
more than I'm home these days

05:13.461 --> 05:15.127
and she has this, like, idea

05:15.128 --> 05:18.460
that being gone on the road is vacation.

05:19.104 --> 05:20.097
I actually got a gig

05:20.168 --> 05:20.751
down in Georgia this week.

05:20.752 --> 05:23.043
I need a guitar player.

05:23.044 --> 05:23.711
I mean, it's just that's my

05:23.712 --> 05:26.253
anniversary this weekend.

05:26.323 --> 05:28.233
Dude.

05:28.248 --> 05:31.271
Road calls.

05:31.603 --> 05:33.552
It's just a matter of

05:34.420 --> 05:35.211
making that decision

05:35.212 --> 05:36.252
do I go or do I spend

05:36.284 --> 05:39.540
some time and hang out with
the family for a little bit

05:39.599 --> 05:41.781
because that's what, you know,
the wife and kid obviously want.

05:41.891 --> 05:44.581
Yeah, it's tough, man, trying
to find that balance of...

05:45.049 --> 05:46.979
road life and, like, Nashville life.

05:47.275 --> 05:49.107
Takes a strain on relationship, man.

05:49.242 --> 05:50.825
- I mean...
- You're telling me.

05:50.871 --> 05:52.098
It's tough, but it's like

05:52.290 --> 05:53.502
it's the only life we know.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.603
It's just the way it is.

06:01.889 --> 06:02.889
How was your day.

06:02.990 --> 06:03.658
It was good.

06:03.714 --> 06:05.964
Thank you for working. I
know it's not the best.

06:06.607 --> 06:08.279
It's not the worst either, I suppose.

06:08.468 --> 06:12.106
♪ We have the party coming up.

06:12.669 --> 06:13.930
And our anniversary.

06:14.014 --> 06:16.806
- We do have an anniversary coming up.
- Five Years

06:16.987 --> 06:18.408
Five years.

06:18.534 --> 06:19.781
Why are you acting weird?

06:20.196 --> 06:22.767
Because have I to propose
something to you?

06:22.861 --> 06:25.064
- What?
- I saw David.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.706
Yeah, I love that guy.

06:27.569 --> 06:28.452
Ah..

06:28.766 --> 06:32.412
David wants me to help him
out on a show coming up.

06:32.849 --> 06:33.380
♪

06:33.432 --> 06:34.888
A short two-day trip.

06:34.982 --> 06:36.774
So, I just wanted to ask if it

06:36.947 --> 06:41.944
were possible to celebrate our
anniversary... a day or two later

06:42.049 --> 06:43.630
than we normally do.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.333
But five years is a really big
deal and I had a whole thing

06:46.400 --> 06:47.524
planned for us.

06:47.713 --> 06:50.270
Five years is a big
accomplishment but it's

06:50.333 --> 06:52.470
important to me that I don't

06:52.548 --> 06:55.761
miss these shows because you
never know what opportunities

06:55.848 --> 06:57.326
could come from that.

07:00.255 --> 07:01.822
I'll tell David I can't take

07:01.863 --> 07:02.674
this opportunity.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.557
Thank you, honey.

07:03.603 --> 07:05.111
But the whole reason we're

07:05.147 --> 07:06.647
- here to begin with...
- I know.

07:06.742 --> 07:08.534
Have you already planned something?

07:08.596 --> 07:09.054
Yeah.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.923
Something really nice.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.146
- High hey, girl.
- Hello.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.217
- Good to see you.
- You to.

07:28.442 --> 07:30.075
- How are you doing.
- I'm good.

07:30.641 --> 07:32.027
- Sorry I'm late.
- Yeah.

07:32.058 --> 07:33.181
Fashionably late.

07:33.182 --> 07:34.229
I waited for you.

07:34.393 --> 07:35.847
Nashville time.

07:35.848 --> 07:38.940
Are you excited about
our birthday party?

07:38.999 --> 07:39.954
Yes. Yes

07:40.069 --> 07:41.863
Would it be crazy... Oh Oh.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.764
if we sang a song together?

07:44.803 --> 07:47.025
Kinda like as our thank
you to their coming?

07:47.032 --> 07:47.771
Yeah

07:48.055 --> 07:49.570
I've always wanted to sing with you.

07:49.632 --> 07:50.383
Same here.

07:50.478 --> 07:51.851
Who do you want to invite?

07:51.914 --> 07:53.787
I think we can invite Bryant?

07:54.022 --> 07:55.663
Super cute.

07:55.773 --> 07:58.089
- Ah.. He is very.. He is cute
- He is cute

07:58.148 --> 07:59.606
I'm not into it.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.581
- Who do you want to invite?
- I might invite Jackson.

08:03.769 --> 08:04.730
Yes

08:04.868 --> 08:06.796
I invited him to the studio and...

08:06.827 --> 08:08.476
- Oh girl!
- Oh girl.

08:09.176 --> 08:10.163
What?

08:10.242 --> 08:13.722
Out of nowhere like he asked
if he could kiss me.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.109
Who asks someone?

08:17.110 --> 08:18.310
Jackson.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.228
That's weird.

08:19.235 --> 08:20.359
How much more awkward would

08:20.360 --> 08:22.234
it have been if he went in and I

08:22.235 --> 08:24.344
was just like no.

08:24.477 --> 08:26.963
Because he probably has never
been shot down in his life.

08:27.021 --> 08:28.251
- Oh!
- And so he

08:28.337 --> 08:29.796
Everybody has been shot down.

08:29.852 --> 08:31.702
When you look like Jackson you
are not getting shot down.

08:31.796 --> 08:32.847
- No.
- No.

08:39.379 --> 08:41.169
Do you want to buy some
of my girl scout cookies?

08:41.269 --> 08:41.769
Yes.

08:41.986 --> 08:43.940
- You have girl scout cookies?
- Yeah.

08:43.995 --> 08:45.051
Do you have thin mints?

08:45.098 --> 08:47.332
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

08:47.455 --> 08:48.331
Hook it up.

08:49.136 --> 08:51.902
I'm... Alisa's calling.

08:52.161 --> 08:52.855
Oh, Alisa.

08:52.995 --> 08:55.047
Sorry, guys, let me make sure
she doesn't need anything.

08:55.890 --> 08:56.890
Hey, girl.

08:56.914 --> 08:57.624
Do you have a second to talk?

08:57.858 --> 09:00.234
I'm at work, so yeah, just real quick.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.276
Did Mack tell you about our

09:01.277 --> 09:02.399
joint birthday party?

09:02.547 --> 09:04.258
Yes, I'm so excited.

09:04.559 --> 09:06.135
She told me that she had
talked to you a little bit

09:06.184 --> 09:07.557
but I just wanted to
make sure you're coming.

09:07.683 --> 09:08.559
Yes. I cannot wait.

09:08.621 --> 09:10.439
Sounds good. What's
going on in your world?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.258
Kerry and I had a talk yesterday.

09:12.265 --> 09:13.431
What happened?

09:13.497 --> 09:15.788
Basically I, like, begged him

09:15.846 --> 09:16.767
to stay home for our

09:16.767 --> 09:17.683
anniversary, even though he had

09:17.683 --> 09:20.308
an opportunity to go on tour with David.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.183
Did he forget it was your anniversary?

09:22.184 --> 09:25.069
No, he just wanted to go.

09:25.170 --> 09:27.675
I just feel like he always prioritizes

09:27.723 --> 09:30.219
music over our relationship.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.846
I get where you're coming from.

09:31.897 --> 09:33.814
I mean, step it up for one day at least.

09:34.017 --> 09:34.725
Exactly.

09:34.726 --> 09:36.793
Okay, I need to figure
out, like, childcare.

09:36.808 --> 09:38.711
I love your child. I'll watch him.

09:38.824 --> 09:39.693
Really?

09:39.736 --> 09:41.517
Like, you guys need a
night to yourself. Yeah.

09:41.603 --> 09:42.478
Oh my god, Awesome.

09:42.542 --> 09:45.080
No problem. Have fun babysitting
all of your children.

09:45.282 --> 09:46.913
Okay, yeah, I gotta get back.

09:46.972 --> 09:48.149
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

09:48.202 --> 09:49.033
Bye.

09:59.313 --> 10:01.771
This is so pretty.

10:07.787 --> 10:10.010
Thanks, appreciate it.

10:13.683 --> 10:14.724
Thank you for staying.

10:14.725 --> 10:16.215
I know you were frustrated.

10:16.285 --> 10:19.159
Missing the tour with David.

10:19.746 --> 10:21.703
I was frustrated at first.

10:22.142 --> 10:23.433
I hope you understand why.

10:23.434 --> 10:25.808
But I'm glad to be here now.

10:25.809 --> 10:26.559
happy anniversary.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.058
Thank you, honey.

10:28.059 --> 10:29.665
I have a big surprise for you.

10:29.699 --> 10:30.823
What is it?

10:30.871 --> 10:32.203
Close your eyes.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.600
Close your eyes.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.841
What is it?

10:35.940 --> 10:38.979
Open them.

10:39.120 --> 10:39.955
What's this?

10:40.519 --> 10:42.266
- A room tonight.
- Hey.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.462
What's the sitter going to do?

10:44.493 --> 10:44.993
Alisa knows.

10:45.407 --> 10:46.672
How about that?

10:47.143 --> 10:48.817
A lot of work to get here.

10:48.868 --> 10:51.119
I pictured marriage being so easy.

10:51.176 --> 10:52.230
I did, too.

10:52.330 --> 10:55.773
- I thought it would make my life...
- Better?

10:56.557 --> 10:58.848
You've made my life better 100 percent.

10:59.497 --> 11:01.720
Don't you think I overreact.

11:01.766 --> 11:03.462
You should always do that like...

11:03.527 --> 11:06.052
leave me with the answer before
you ask me a question like that.

11:06.128 --> 11:07.489
- Like a lawyer.
- Yeah.

11:07.551 --> 11:09.300
Objection, leading the witness.

11:09.433 --> 11:10.681
I accept.

11:11.113 --> 11:15.971
- Speaking of lawyering.
- Yeah.

11:17.572 --> 11:20.250
I've kinda narrowed it down
to the schools I want.

11:20.361 --> 11:23.735
- Okay.
- Denver, L.A., Portland, Nashville.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.682
I really like L.A.

11:26.683 --> 11:28.141
We tried to live there once

11:28.142 --> 11:29.266
and it didn't work.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.267
This is what I'm dreaming about.

11:31.268 --> 11:32.891
I'm dreaming that while I'm in

11:32.892 --> 11:34.891
law school wherever I am,

11:34.892 --> 11:37.547
you are touring and excelling in music.

11:37.625 --> 11:38.316
Yeah.

11:38.485 --> 11:39.967
We don't have to live in the

11:40.045 --> 11:41.642
same place during that time but

11:41.643 --> 11:43.808
we are together a lot.

11:43.809 --> 11:46.513
Are you even open to it at all?

11:47.445 --> 11:49.069
As of now no.

11:49.093 --> 11:50.384
You're not compromising.

11:50.391 --> 11:52.895
Think about it. You get
to do what you want to do.

11:53.007 --> 11:55.618
Live in the city you want
do the career you want.

11:55.820 --> 11:58.896
For law school, this might not

11:58.990 --> 11:59.974
be the best place.

11:59.975 --> 12:01.625
Here's the thing... I'm staying here.

12:08.858 --> 12:09.940
I do support you.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.213
I just think there is a

12:11.284 --> 12:13.846
compromise that isn't you moving

12:13.885 --> 12:15.308
across the country.

12:15.309 --> 12:16.682
Sorry that sometimes I have to

12:16.683 --> 12:19.485
miss some things to go on the road.

12:19.544 --> 12:21.882
You mean the world to me and...

12:22.003 --> 12:23.457
I want to be here for all things

12:23.568 --> 12:25.448
important but I hope you can

12:25.506 --> 12:29.574
find it in your heart to forgive
me for... wanting to chase my dream

12:29.639 --> 12:31.488
as hard as I do.

12:34.816 --> 12:39.599
Sometimes I'm not as supportive
as I should be of your music.

12:40.351 --> 12:42.100
But I am really proud of you.

12:42.101 --> 12:43.600
Thank you.

12:43.601 --> 12:44.476
And I love you.

12:44.477 --> 12:46.125
I love you, too.

12:50.725 --> 12:52.166
Should we go put this to use?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.785
Let's do it.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.462
All right, let's get in and get out.
What do you say?

13:06.581 --> 13:09.414
I mean, first of all, this is
what you are wanting me to come

13:09.554 --> 13:11.758
to, to meet your new girlfriend.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.831
What are you thinking? Dress...

13:13.910 --> 13:15.507
- Dress...
- Pants? What

13:15.566 --> 13:17.496
Something a little flashy.

13:17.537 --> 13:19.365
Classy and flashy,
that's the way I live.

13:19.449 --> 13:21.034
I'd say more on the side of

13:21.098 --> 13:22.596
not too, too flashy.

13:22.597 --> 13:25.013
Okay.

13:25.014 --> 13:26.870
Supposed to be short and low.

13:27.011 --> 13:28.212
Ready to go try some things on?

13:28.313 --> 13:29.513
Are you, is the question.

13:29.579 --> 13:31.032
- I'm ready.
- All right, let's do it.

13:33.592 --> 13:35.241
You going to come out
and show me this today?

13:35.306 --> 13:35.805
Are you ready?

13:35.806 --> 13:36.591
Let's see.

13:37.513 --> 13:39.231
What do you think?

13:39.325 --> 13:41.149
I mean, it's just a lot for

13:41.224 --> 13:42.846
the first time meeting Jessica.

13:42.847 --> 13:43.513
I don't know.

13:43.513 --> 13:44.513
I want this to go well.

13:44.513 --> 13:45.513
I really do.

13:45.513 --> 13:46.223
You're my cousin.

13:46.224 --> 13:47.472
You're my family.

13:47.473 --> 13:48.348
I just want them to see

13:48.348 --> 13:48.805
the best side of you

13:48.805 --> 13:49.513
and I want you to make a good

13:49.513 --> 13:50.513
impression, you know?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.483
I think that this looks perfect wear.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.872
Well.

13:53.949 --> 13:55.858
I say it's a done deal.
Check that one off.

13:55.943 --> 13:57.728
I don't know about all that.
We'll figure it out.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.470
We'll see.

14:26.931 --> 14:27.722
Hi, I think I met you before.

14:27.778 --> 14:29.672
Alisa... good to meet you.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.704
This is a fun place.

14:30.768 --> 14:32.599
Yeah, I'm liking it.

14:33.139 --> 14:33.805
All right, hey, what do you

14:33.806 --> 14:35.225
want for your birthday?

14:36.860 --> 14:37.776
Love.

14:38.098 --> 14:39.512
What does that mean?

14:39.513 --> 14:42.032
Bryant, find her love!

15:12.530 --> 15:13.696
Hi.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.579
Hey.

15:14.744 --> 15:15.201
Hey.

15:15.412 --> 15:17.024
I'm Jessica.

15:17.069 --> 15:18.408
Nice to meet you in the flesh.

15:18.446 --> 15:19.536
You're beautiful.

15:19.606 --> 15:20.314
I know.

15:20.349 --> 15:21.855
I've heard so much about you.

15:21.915 --> 15:23.122
Hi, I'm Alisa.

15:23.178 --> 15:25.633
Alisa, it is so good to meet you.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.699
Nice to meet you too.

15:26.738 --> 15:27.567
You're absolutely gorgeous.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.513
Thank you.

15:28.514 --> 15:29.530
So are you.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.596
Rachel.

15:32.597 --> 15:34.113
Hi, so good to meet you guys.

15:34.155 --> 15:35.820
Are y'all married?

15:35.855 --> 15:36.521
Married.

15:36.577 --> 15:38.097
Okay, perfect.

16:07.966 --> 16:10.049
You're an incredible
human being but like...

16:12.015 --> 16:13.156
..I have. I made a mistake.

16:13.219 --> 16:15.523
Sorta like...

16:15.571 --> 16:17.684
You can't hold your
past against yourself.

16:17.703 --> 16:20.444
So what do y'all think
about Jackson and Jessica?

16:20.498 --> 16:21.373
He's great.

16:21.412 --> 16:22.030
Yeah, we like him.

16:22.073 --> 16:24.520
He asked her to kiss
him, and she said no.

16:24.527 --> 16:26.964
It could just be she's
just taking it slow.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.400
I don't know.

16:28.441 --> 16:29.899
I think he just got rejected for

16:29.954 --> 16:32.358
the first time ever and now he's

16:32.473 --> 16:34.565
completely hurt about it.

16:34.615 --> 16:36.449
She wasn't ready for him to kiss her.

16:37.348 --> 16:38.778
Maybe it could happen tonight!

16:38.840 --> 16:40.574
Hey!

16:40.803 --> 16:41.876
What's up, y'all?

16:41.936 --> 16:43.317
My name's Jessica.

16:43.612 --> 16:44.437
I'm Alisa.

16:44.487 --> 16:46.775
And it's our birthday tonight!

16:47.866 --> 16:48.709
Woo!

17:14.727 --> 17:16.419
Heh!

17:58.616 --> 17:59.525
Happy Birthday.

17:59.626 --> 18:00.460
Happy Birthday.

18:00.531 --> 18:01.569
Thank you, guys.

18:01.601 --> 18:02.851
Happy Birthday!

18:03.134 --> 18:05.611
Thank you guys!

18:06.994 --> 18:08.880
Have you ever thought more
about law school, or?

18:08.946 --> 18:12.002
I am applying to law school.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.748
That's really seat Sarah.

18:41.022 --> 18:43.624
That's really sweet.

18:46.811 --> 18:48.296
I know.

19:03.286 --> 19:05.025
I couldn't be in your shoes,

19:12.048 --> 19:13.047
Don't cry.

19:13.079 --> 19:15.054
I don't want to make you cry.

19:54.285 --> 19:55.763
Next time on Music City.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.326
So how are you and Jackson?

19:57.376 --> 19:58.968
- Doing really well really well.
- Really well.

19:59.015 --> 20:00.039
Really well.

20:00.082 --> 20:01.037
I really enjoy hanging out with you.

20:01.044 --> 20:02.388
You have been really cool

20:02.416 --> 20:03.499
about taking things slow.

20:03.608 --> 20:05.670
You could be miss Tennessee

20:05.731 --> 20:08.744
in 48 hours, going to miss USA.

20:12.358 --> 20:14.959
Why is this girl talking to

20:14.960 --> 20:16.585
Jackson so heavy?

20:16.619 --> 20:18.904
I got a text message few days ago.

20:18.974 --> 20:20.166
Your marriage is stronger

20:20.218 --> 20:22.341
than some guy who's coming
up out of the blue.

20:22.623 --> 20:24.537
I don't know that.
