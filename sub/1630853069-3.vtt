WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:09.384
(tense music playing)

00:13.221 --> 00:14.013
(spits)

00:16.766 --> 00:18.476
Captain...

00:18.560 --> 00:21.062
we're a few hundred yards
out from "The Revenge."

00:21.146 --> 00:22.355
Nice.
Very good.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.023
Love that.

00:25.984 --> 00:29.112
Honestly, I really don't think
this Bonnet is worth your time.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.030
Mmm.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.992
So, he's a fancy man
with a fancy ship,

00:34.075 --> 00:35.618
and he travels with
a brigade of imbeciles.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.703
Do I have that right?

00:36.786 --> 00:38.788
Yes, I suppose
you could put it--

00:38.872 --> 00:42.125
And he bested you at swordplay.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.879
They tricked us.
It was an ambush.
Completely unprofessional.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.758
-Hmm.
-Izzy: So, what's the plan, sir?

00:49.841 --> 00:52.135
Do we open fire?

00:52.218 --> 00:53.094
Or would you rather
we just attack them,

00:53.178 --> 00:56.848
kill them, throw them
out to the sharks, sir?

00:56.931 --> 00:59.017
Wait till they make landfall

00:59.100 --> 01:02.395
then invite 'em aboard the ship.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.230
And, Izzy, I want you
to handle this personally.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.567
-Oh, Edward, can't
I just send the boys?
-Mm-mm.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.818
No, I want
this done right.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.279
After all,
he is a gentleman.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.991
We want to make
a good impression.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.078
Stupid fuckin' Stede Bonnet.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.373
(harpsichord fanfare)

01:25.668 --> 01:28.671
Captain Stede:
Blackbeard, Captain Kidd...

01:28.755 --> 01:31.216
The Gentleman Pirate.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.718
What do those names
conjure for you?

01:33.802 --> 01:37.305
Well, the first two are, like,
very, very talented pirates.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.473
The badger's knackers.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.975
But I have no idea who
the... last bloke is.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.520
Well, the last one is
the scariest of them all.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.979
-Oh yeah? Keep talkin'.
-Yeah, he's a killer.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.941
But instead
of killing with weapons,

01:48.024 --> 01:51.194
he kills with...
kindness.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.323
Oh, right, so you're
the G-Gentleman Pirate, then?

01:55.406 --> 01:57.367
-Well-sussed!
-Yeah.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.036
Polite menace.
That'll be my brand.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.247
Every legendary
pirate needs one.

02:02.330 --> 02:05.041
-You getting all this?
-Yep. Yes, I am.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.210
(Frenchie clears throat)
Um...

02:07.293 --> 02:10.046
as I said before, Captain,
I'm not the strongest writer.

02:10.129 --> 02:11.131
-Captain Stede: Hmm.
-Or reader.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.006
Well, there's no words
on there at all.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.260
-No, 'cause I've drawn them.
-Right.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.388
Well, you'll have to do
until we find Lucius.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.806
I just hope
he's not dead.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.599
That could be bad...

02:21.683 --> 02:24.561
-for the general
vibe around here.
-Yeah.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.229
Oh, actually, uh,

02:26.312 --> 02:28.398
since we're on the
subject of bad vibes,

02:28.481 --> 02:31.442
what is the plan for
the remaining hostage?

02:31.526 --> 02:33.194
-Remaining hostage?
-He's still out there.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.155
-Not lookin' great.
-Oh god, we need a plan.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.074
Mm, 'cause he's kind of
bringin' everyone down,

02:38.157 --> 02:40.076
bit of a pirate pooper.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.913
Dear lord,
it smells like
he's been roasting.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.374
The sun did
work its wonders.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.084
Well good
and savory now, Cap'n.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.128
Some nice
crispy bits there.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.254
Yes, well, let's get
him some water...

02:51.337 --> 02:55.341
and maybe hold a jacket
over his head or something.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.801
Generate some shade.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.848
Ah, that's... lovely.
Cheers.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.601
Right, well, what should
we do with our hostage?

03:04.684 --> 03:06.102
-Any ideas?
-Black Pete: Ooh!

03:06.185 --> 03:07.770
-I know.
-What, you mean
other than kill him?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.939
Oh, everyone does that.
I think a gentleman rises

03:10.023 --> 03:12.191
above those baser instincts.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.526
Black Pete,
did you have an idea?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.903
Nah, I was just
gonna say kill him.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.112
Oh, uh, cut off
all his limbs

03:16.195 --> 03:17.947
and turn his back
into a table.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.116
No, let's not.
Thank you, though.

03:20.199 --> 03:23.036
-Anyone else?
-We could ransom him
back to the English.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.914
-Ooh, good thinking, Roach.
-Ah.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.333
What ya need...
is a fence.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.336
I reckon you'll find one...

03:32.462 --> 03:34.839
at The Republic of Pirates.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.760
An isle not too far at all,

03:38.843 --> 03:43.932
where the law lies doggo
and plunderers rule.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.185
Well, one can only hope
he's talking to us,

03:47.268 --> 03:48.519
in which case, wow!

03:48.603 --> 03:49.687
Now that sounds like
the place to be, right?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.981
No, it's shit.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.151
It's become quite
touristy, I've heard,

03:55.234 --> 03:59.405
and just not
as cool anymore.
Right, Jim?

03:59.489 --> 04:01.324
Well, I'll be
the judge of that.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.909
It's time for the wider
criminal community

04:02.992 --> 04:04.827
to meet the Gentleman Pirate.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.748
-Oh my god, no.
-Mr. Buttons...

04:08.831 --> 04:11.584
set a course for
the Republic of Pirates.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.545
Aye, aye, Cap'n!
Hoist the main brace.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.091
Oluwande:
We can't go back there.

04:18.174 --> 04:21.135
Spanish Jackie has put
a price on your head,
remember?

04:21.219 --> 04:22.637
You mean for the thing
with her husband?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.473
The thi--
Yes, the thing
where you killed him.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.101
Pff.
Olu, grow up.

04:28.184 --> 04:28.977
We live in
a state of nature.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.689
Besides, she's got,
like, 20 husbands.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.233
Well, 19 now.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.695
Jim... a fake beard
and a wax nose

04:38.778 --> 04:40.196
is not gonna
fool Jackie.

04:40.279 --> 04:43.074
-You couldn't even fool Lucius!
-Oh, mm, that's different.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.076
Ese bastardito
caught me unawares.

04:45.159 --> 04:45.743
Lucius:
I'll tell no one! I swear!

04:45.827 --> 04:48.037
Cállate, hombrecito.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.330
Maybe, in your next life,

04:49.414 --> 04:49.872
you'll be a little
less nosey, huh?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.040
Lucius:
Ow! Jesus.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.501
Can you help me
throw this overboard?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.294
I don't think
that's a good idea,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.213
us being on
the same team and all.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.049
Fine.

05:00.133 --> 05:04.220
(gasps)
Oh god! Oh god!
Thank you!

05:04.303 --> 05:06.681
Oh, you made
a wise decision today,

05:06.764 --> 05:08.099
and I feel
really good about this.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.560
Nope, I can't do this.
Get back in.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.519
-(speaking Spanish)
-No, no, no!
You can't! You can't!

05:11.602 --> 05:12.895
You don't know what
it's like in there!

05:12.979 --> 05:14.772
Have either of you seen--

05:14.856 --> 05:16.858
Lucius, there you are.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.069
Oh god, why're you so sweaty?

05:20.153 --> 05:24.407
Um, so we have been
exercising together

05:24.490 --> 05:28.870
because we want our
bodies to be smaller.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.246
-Everything's fine.
-Well, I'm not fine.

05:30.329 --> 05:33.958
I've got a journal full
of doodles instead of words.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.668
I'm glad you're making friends,
but tighten up, mate.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.921
Come on.
I need your help getting me
dressed for the big day.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.299
(lively chatter, laughter)

05:41.883 --> 05:44.135
(retching)

05:45.678 --> 05:47.096
All right,
it's a bit gentrified,

05:47.180 --> 05:50.058
but it's still
the Republic of Pirates.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.436
-I remember when
this place was gritty.
-What, 10 years ago?

05:53.519 --> 05:56.606
Please, place got lame.
Is that a gift shop?

05:56.689 --> 05:59.984
(gasps)
Republic of Pirates.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.986
Quite the hellish cesspool.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.946
-Come along.
-Sorry, um,

06:04.030 --> 06:05.323
do these outfits
maybe feel like

06:05.406 --> 06:07.784
-an error in judgment, or--
-Captain Stede:
It's a power move.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.118
Make people feel
underdressed,

06:09.202 --> 06:10.745
and suddenly
you're the one in charge.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.663
(yelling)

06:12.747 --> 06:15.291
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh god, this isn't happening!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.168
Aww, come on!
You couldn't have
sidestepped?

06:17.251 --> 06:20.129
-(crying)
-Right, too late. Let's go.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.091
Maybe just take
the jacket off.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.175
(coughing)

06:28.221 --> 06:30.139
I've never felt
so at home.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.894
Man for sale!
Man for sale!

06:34.977 --> 06:37.897
-Healthy, sturdy,
obedient man for sale!
-Captain?

06:37.980 --> 06:41.567
-So, we're leaving, right?
-Yeah, and quickly.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.362
Captain Stede:
Man for sale!

06:44.445 --> 06:45.863
Listen,
I think you might
wanna adjust the pitch

06:45.947 --> 06:47.990
because it's
quite unclear
what you're selling.

06:48.074 --> 06:48.950
Look, I might be
new to pirating,

06:49.033 --> 06:51.452
but I know a thing or two
about salesmanship.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.328
After you.

06:52.411 --> 06:53.538
Check out this

06:53.621 --> 06:54.372
fabulous booty I'm hawkin'!

06:55.832 --> 06:56.791
Whoa.

06:56.874 --> 07:00.461
Bonifacia Jimenez,

07:00.545 --> 07:02.046
wanted for murder.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.589
I told you Jackie
was still pissed.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.008
Reward, 50 doubloons?!
That's it?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.887
-I think you're gettin'
the wrong message, Jim.
-But I, I wasted her husband!

07:09.971 --> 07:14.308
-That's worth a thousand
doubloons at least!
-Shh! Quit shouting!

07:14.392 --> 07:17.645
Captain Stede:
Man for sale!
Someone, buy my booty!

07:19.230 --> 07:21.732
-Man for sale!
-Over here.

07:21.816 --> 07:22.441
Oh, here we go.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.195
One piece
of silver's me bid.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.238
So, do I get all
three of ye's, er--

07:27.321 --> 07:29.866
No, only one
of us is for sale.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.910
Mm, so the other
two watch, or?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.704
He thinks you're a prostitute.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.123
I'm no prostitute, mate!

07:37.206 --> 07:38.291
Oh.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.377
We could've made magic.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.296
Unbelievable.
Do we look like
prostitutes to you?

07:43.379 --> 07:47.550
Well, not terribly
successful ones.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.510
Jim, what're you doin'?
Someone's gonna see you.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.056
-So far, so good.
-Jim--

07:54.140 --> 07:57.310
Oh, hey, guys!
Ooh, this place
looks promising.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.812
Maybe we'll find
some buyers in here.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.356
No, no, no, Captain.
You d-- You don't
wanna go in there.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.233
It's a, it's a shithole.

08:04.317 --> 08:04.984
There's a lot of crime,

08:05.067 --> 08:08.070
and, uh, diseases,

08:08.154 --> 08:10.781
and, uh, poorly
mixed drinks.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.742
Jim's already gone in.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.078
Jim?! No, no, no, Jim!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.121
Does look a bit
scary in there.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.748
I'm gonna need you
to hold it together,
and come in.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.584
Well, if it's scary,
I'll probably just
head back to the ship--

08:21.667 --> 08:23.252
Ah, Lucius, look at this.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.296
Come. Come here.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.923
You have to sketch us
in front of this.

08:27.006 --> 08:27.506
It's so authentic.

08:29.258 --> 08:29.508
Look tortured.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.013
(softly):
Okay, like we rehearsed.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.933
(music, chattering)

08:38.017 --> 08:40.394
Hear ye, hear ye!

08:40.478 --> 08:42.063
(music stops)

08:42.146 --> 08:42.480
(softly):
Oh fuck.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.151
Please join me in welcoming
for his regional debut...

08:47.235 --> 08:50.238
The Brigand of Barbados...

08:50.321 --> 08:51.656
-(mouthing along)
-the Cream of the Caribbean...

08:53.282 --> 08:54.492
The Gentleman Pirate.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.122
Hi, all.
Nice to be here.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.625
I may be
landed gentry,

09:02.708 --> 09:05.169
but I'm thrilled
to be granted entry.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.004
-(nervous laugh)
-(grumbles)

09:07.088 --> 09:09.090
(coughing)

09:09.173 --> 09:11.425
(clears throat)
Well, the drinks
are on us.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.552
-(pirates laughing)
-Oh, come on!

09:13.636 --> 09:15.221
Pirate:
Drinks be on ye now!

09:15.304 --> 09:16.514
Oh... god.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.313
Jim, Jim, this is not
keepin' a low profile.

09:24.397 --> 09:29.193
Oluwande Boodhari,
as I live and breathe.

09:29.277 --> 09:34.323
-Geraldo.
-You have got some
world-class, rock-hard...

09:34.407 --> 09:38.703
absolutely titanic balls
coming in here.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.997
You know, I actually thought
you'd be dead by now.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.165
I did, too!

09:43.249 --> 09:46.168
Life is funny.
Who's your friend?

09:46.252 --> 09:50.464
Um... This is Jim.
Jim--

09:50.548 --> 09:54.385
You don't know Jim
because Jim is a mute.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.512
So, that's my friend.

09:57.596 --> 10:01.767
Naturally, Jackie's
gonna want a word.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.982
(ominous music playing)

10:08.065 --> 10:10.276
Yeah, no, naturally.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.904
-Um... just, uh, just
let me know when--
-Now, man!

10:14.947 --> 10:16.699
Not you!

10:29.920 --> 10:32.173
Hey, Jackie.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.929
-Lads.
-Spanish Jackie: Have a seat.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.474
-Yep.
-No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.434
-(tapping chair)
-Right here.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.067
Hey.

10:52.568 --> 10:57.448
Olu, Olu... Olu.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
Where you been?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.203
You been avoiding me?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.955
What?
No, no, I...

11:06.082 --> 11:06.749
I actually
thought you were

11:06.832 --> 11:08.834
kind of mad at me,
if I'm honest.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.670
Why would Jackie be mad?

11:11.754 --> 11:17.218
Well, I kind of
recommended you
hire a waitress...

11:17.301 --> 11:19.887
who stabbed your
favorite husband up, so.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.722
Oh yeah,
that's true, that's true.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.394
Bonifacia Jimenez.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.813
The bitch who
stole my life.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.442
The bitch who
stole my joy.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.447
But it's not like
you had anything
to do with it, right?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.199
Like you helped her
set it up?

11:40.282 --> 11:43.285
N-No. C--
Uh, correct.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.329
I barely even
knew the bitch.
Ooh.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.625
But you do know where
she is, though, right?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.210
(cocking gun)

11:51.293 --> 11:54.713
Seems like I remember
both of you guys
leavin' town...

11:54.797 --> 11:57.466
-at the same time.
-I killed her!

11:59.009 --> 12:00.177
I killed her.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.972
Yeah, I didn't,
I didn't like
the way she...

12:03.055 --> 12:04.223
handled herself.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.976
I thought it were
kind of g-gauche...

12:07.059 --> 12:07.852
if I'm honest.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.482
I appreciate that, kid.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.485
It was fuckin'
kinda gauche.

12:17.778 --> 12:18.737
You know, Jackie
got feelings, too.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.283
Jackie is a person also.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.204
What about your sexy
little friend over there?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.497
You gonna invite him over?

12:32.918 --> 12:33.752
Yeah...

12:34.753 --> 12:35.921
I'd love to.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.801
Barkeep!

12:40.885 --> 12:44.680
-What?
-Uh, please bring us
a round of your finest wine.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.266
-We're out of wine.
-Well, then what's
this all over my boy?

12:48.100 --> 12:48.851
That's blood.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.854
I mean, we serve that.
Do you want blood?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.439
I think we'll go
for something stronger.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.900
Bring us a round of--

12:56.692 --> 12:57.693
Eww...

12:58.486 --> 12:59.695
ugh...

12:59.778 --> 13:03.073
Ah, this tasty-looking
stuff. On the double!

13:06.285 --> 13:09.371
It's good, isn't it?
Being amongst proper maniacs.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.208
No amateurs here,
Lucius.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.209
Ah.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.049
Mm, it's nutty.

13:20.132 --> 13:24.220
-What do you call this?
-It's juice from the nose jar.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.431
-Hmm?
-Geraldo: Jackie's been
collecting them for years.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.017
You misbehave...
(makes slicing noise)

13:30.100 --> 13:31.227
you end up in here.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.561
-(both gagging)
-Oh god.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.355
I've a few
colleagues in there.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.899
-(gagging)
-(Captain sighs)

13:36.982 --> 13:39.777
-You again.
-Geraldo: Mr. Hands, welcome.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.530
-It's been a while.
-Izzy: Yeah...

13:42.613 --> 13:45.115
because I hate
this fucking place.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.701
But for some
inexplicable reason,

13:47.785 --> 13:51.413
my boss would like
a word with you, Bonnet.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.208
Yes, well, everyone
wants a piece of
the Gentleman Pirate.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.085
Get in line.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.963
-I'm very sorry to have
to tell you this, Iggy.
-Izzy.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.632
Whatever, I don't care,
but we're busy at the moment,

14:01.715 --> 14:03.551
fencing our
remaining hostage.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.387
AKA, the one you
didn't manage to steal.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.306
So, I'll tell my captain that
you're declining then, yeah?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.684
Or tell him
he's got terrible
taste in flunkies,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.562
and he can go
suck eggs in hell.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.066
(softly):
Gladly.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.823
-To my dead hubby! Yes!
-Yes.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.992
Alfeo de la Vaca!

14:28.075 --> 14:30.077
One of the best
that ever done it.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.079
(laughs)
Mmm.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.832
He was a saint.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.128
I keep a altar
to him in the back

14:39.211 --> 14:40.379
with a couple
of his mementos.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.299
(Spanish guitar playing)

14:44.967 --> 14:47.094
Minion:
Jackie, you are needed.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.016
Business calls.
Don't go anywhere.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.395
Oh, my god.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.022
I bet she's got
my dagger back there.

14:58.105 --> 14:58.689
Okay, look, you've
proven your point.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.108
Now, can we just let this go?

15:02.234 --> 15:04.069
Fine.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.992
Jim, what are you doin'?
What are you do--

15:10.909 --> 15:12.995
J--

15:13.078 --> 15:15.581
Card Player:
I'd maybe give ya
20 doubloons for the Brit.

15:15.664 --> 15:16.915
Seems a tad low.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.084
We're already
expecting another offer.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.544
From who?
The prostitute bloke?

15:20.628 --> 15:21.712
Captain Stede:
Ha, ha! No.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.381
The bidding starts
at 50 doubloons.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.049
Take it or shake it.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.177
-50.
-51.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.221
-60.
-61.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.016
-(yelling)
-Should we attempt to lower
the temperature, or--

15:34.099 --> 15:37.019
No, no. Don't be scared.
This is a bidding war.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.855
-(yelling)
-Lucius: Okay, it's startin'
to look like an actual war!

15:39.938 --> 15:42.691
Think it through guys, please!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.860
Alfeo de la Vaca.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.656
The man who
killed my family.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.868
We meet again, pendejo.

15:52.951 --> 15:55.120
Now give me back my dagger.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.917
-Where is it?
-(door shuts)

16:00.626 --> 16:03.379
I knew you was a thief.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.384
♪ ♪

16:08.467 --> 16:11.387
But I loves me a thief.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.640
(yelling)

16:14.723 --> 16:16.100
C'mon, guys.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.060
(yelling)

16:18.143 --> 16:20.437
-I think we should intervene.
-No, you intervene.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.772
Fine, I'll intervene.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.400
Don't kill
one another, you guys!

16:24.483 --> 16:28.028
Ooh... (chuckles)

16:28.112 --> 16:31.782
you are one
sexy thing.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.159
Relax...

16:34.243 --> 16:37.037
You're stiff in all
the wrong places.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.455
(chuckles)

16:38.539 --> 16:39.373
(grunts)

16:40.207 --> 16:43.001
-(crashing)
-Pirate: Oh sorry!

16:43.669 --> 16:43.961
My noses!

16:49.258 --> 16:50.718
Lucius, can you please
help me pick these up?

16:50.801 --> 16:52.052
No, I'm not gonna
do that, sorry.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.392
-(tense music playing)
-Oh...

17:03.522 --> 17:05.065
Fuck is you
supposed to be?

17:05.149 --> 17:08.068
-Hi, I'm Stede.
-He's the Gentleman Pirate.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.949
Well, I got bad news
for you, Genital Pirate.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.368
I'm about to start
a whole new nose jar.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.957
-Uh, baby--
-Don't say that.
Don't call me that.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.584
Well, I just figured
since we're married,
and--

17:23.667 --> 17:25.836
None of my other husbands
have a problem with it.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.963
-That's mine.
-Spanish Jackie:
Do not call me that in here.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.798
Okay, well,
Izzy Hands was in here

17:29.882 --> 17:32.176
asking about him
for his boss.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.011
Blackbeard?

17:34.094 --> 17:37.765
Muthafuckin' Blackbeard
wanna talk to this guy?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.357
(exhales)
Thank you so much.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.901
Shut up.

17:48.984 --> 17:53.113
You're an idiot...
and you're banished.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.325
Do not darken
my doorstep again.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.660
-Lovely.
-Well, I'll just,
I'll just squeeze past then.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.829
Thank you so much
for having us.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.665
Well, the Gentleman Pirate
bids you all--

18:03.749 --> 18:05.042
-(glass shattering)
-Ah!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.878
(pirating shouting)

18:10.130 --> 18:11.089
He's not interested
in meeting.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.509
What?

18:14.176 --> 18:15.886
I explicitly told him...

18:15.969 --> 18:19.932
Blackbeard desired his company.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.391
But does he
know who I am?

18:22.226 --> 18:23.852
Seemed to, yeah.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.521
And still,
he said no.

18:27.815 --> 18:32.486
You can "go suck eggs in hell"

18:32.569 --> 18:35.239
was his response, I believe.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.326
Fascinating.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.746
I'm starting to think
you're not the only one

18:42.830 --> 18:43.914
who's not cut out
for this, Lucius.

18:43.997 --> 18:47.042
Don't be too
hard on yourself.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.044
Anyone could
break a nose jar.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.213
Well, see, this is
what I'm talking about.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.673
You and I,
we shouldn't have
this kind of rapport.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.134
Man:
Hey there.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.011
Are you the fancy man
sellin' the British bloke?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.848
No! Wait, yes.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.267
-Oh, are you interested?
-Terribly.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.394
-And I'd pay handsomely...
-Deal.

19:05.477 --> 19:05.811
for parts of him.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.729
Wait, what?

19:07.813 --> 19:10.232
I'll do the disassembly
myself.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.193
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

19:13.277 --> 19:13.360
Hmm?

19:15.153 --> 19:17.406
No... No.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.782
-(gun clicks)
-(Captain gasps)

19:18.866 --> 19:19.575
Geraldo:
Kick rocks, freak.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.119
Big boys
need to talk.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.079
No, no, no, no, no.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.083
-Hey.
-Captain: Hey.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.710
I'm gonna shoot
you straight, man.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.752
When you first came in,

19:30.836 --> 19:33.547
I didn't think
you had balls...

19:33.630 --> 19:34.631
-at all.
-Yeah.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.633
But when I saw
how you handled
yourself with Jackie,

19:36.717 --> 19:38.927
I was like, "Oh man,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.305
he's got balls!
For days!"

19:42.973 --> 19:44.391
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.893
Balls for days.

19:47.185 --> 19:50.105
-Maybe I do.
-Listen, I, I got
a little bit of, um...

19:50.188 --> 19:53.108
a side hustle
with an exclusive client,

19:53.192 --> 19:56.612
but he only deals with...
refined types, like yourself.

19:57.154 --> 19:57.237
Hmm!

19:58.780 --> 20:00.949
He's gonna love you.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.998
Oluwande:
You almost got us killed!
You know that, right?!

20:08.081 --> 20:10.334
And for what?
She didn't even
have the dagger!

20:10.417 --> 20:12.127
She did!
(speaks Spanish)

20:12.211 --> 20:14.087
on Stede's stupid
fucking nose!

20:14.171 --> 20:15.964
I would've had it
if you didn't rush
us out of there.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.633
-(knocks on door)
-Shh!

20:17.716 --> 20:20.302
Lucius: Hi, guys.
Oh, guy, well, guy--
Well, guy and lady--

20:20.385 --> 20:23.055
Oh, you are pushing
your luck, hombrecito.

20:23.138 --> 20:26.266
Um, I was just
wondering whether
your dagger had,

20:26.350 --> 20:27.935
um, something
on the handle,

20:28.018 --> 20:30.854
-a family name, maybe? J--
-Jimenez. ¿Qué pasa?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.272
Uh, well...
(sings) Ahh!

20:35.525 --> 20:37.736
-Jim: You found it.
-Lucius: Yeah, yeah.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.655
Well, I guess you
could say I'm a bit
of a pickpocket

20:39.738 --> 20:41.406
from back in the day.
I don't like to even
talk about it.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.993
-It was not cute--
-Now this... is a good friend.

20:50.249 --> 20:50.374
Oh, my god.

20:53.001 --> 20:57.339
Okay... well, wouldn't
that be crazy if I was
suddenly like, into Jim?

20:57.422 --> 20:59.049
(laughs)
Okay. All right, then.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.010
Makin' our approach
now, Captain!

21:02.511 --> 21:04.388
Oh.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.976
That doesn't look

21:09.059 --> 21:10.686
Oh, it's not.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.396
Sorry, I thought I said, uh...

21:12.479 --> 21:14.231
we're selling your guy
to the Spanish Navy.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.652
Oh...
And we're sure
they're friendly?

21:18.735 --> 21:21.071
Oh yeah.
These guys are the best.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.197
Super chill.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.867
Come on.
We'll make this quick.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.620
Let's bring that guy.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.664
He looks tough.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.670
In honor
of our hosts,

21:36.753 --> 21:38.714
I've had Roach put
together some food.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.133
I made an assortment
of tapas.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.010
Tapas means "little plates."

21:43.093 --> 21:46.054
Yeah, I know about tapas.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.474
-They're like
catnip to Spaniards.
-Oh, exactly.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.227
Besides,
a gentleman never
arrives empty-handed.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.899
Lucius, once I climb aboard,
I want you to start sketching.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.946
The world's about to witness

22:03.030 --> 22:05.907
the Gentleman Pirate's
first business transaction.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.952
Oh! Now this is a ladder.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.835
Loving your ladder setup,
by the way. Very stable.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.546
El Gentleman Pirata?

22:19.629 --> 22:20.756
I am he.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.635
(ominous harpsichord playing)

22:26.636 --> 22:29.473

Filthy scum.
(speaking Spanish)

22:49.701 --> 22:51.953
Hold on!
Bring that one back.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.165
Almost forgot.

22:55.248 --> 22:58.168
Jackie wanted this
for the new jar.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.129

23:19.731 --> 23:20.816
-Did you know that?
-How would I know that?!

23:20.899 --> 23:24.402
Oh, thank god it's out.
I'm so bad at keeping secrets.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.738

23:28.448 --> 23:30.117
-And she can talk?
-(spits)

23:32.369 --> 23:35.705
I'm actually
super into that,
so... thanks.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.542
Jackie made you
straight away.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.336
She just wanted
to watch you sweat
a little bit.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.714
All she had to do
was set a low bounty...

23:44.798 --> 23:47.801
sit back, and wait
for you to return.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.136
Adios, Bonifacia.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.056
You can't fool her.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.518
She's Jackie...
the love of my life.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.605
And she's got
the biggest balls
of them all.
