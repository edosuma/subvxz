WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:08.341
- What's up, guys?

00:08.408 --> 00:09.676
Welcome to
"The Dude Perfect Show."

00:09.743 --> 00:12.245
Ever since we moved in here
at DPHQ2, Garrett and Coby

00:12.312 --> 00:14.514
have taken turns
cleaning the bathroom.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.815
- Ugh.
- They're done.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.083
They've had enough.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.551
- Not doing it anymore.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.053
- Putting my foot down.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.188
- Since those guys are out,
you might be thinking us three

00:22.255 --> 00:23.490
are just fighting
to get a role

00:23.556 --> 00:25.125
in the bathroom cleaning
responsibility job.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.960
And we're not. Not at all.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.129
So we're gonna have ourselves
something I like to call

00:29.195 --> 00:30.897
a Battle of the Senseless
to see

00:30.964 --> 00:32.999
who's gonna take over
bathroom duties.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.734
- What do you mean
Battle of the Senseless?

00:34.801 --> 00:36.302
- Let me break it down for you,
Cods.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.037
If you can't sniff,
and you don't have

00:38.104 --> 00:40.273
a very good sense of touch,
I think that person

00:40.340 --> 00:41.941
is perfectly suited
to clean the bathroom.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.476
- That makes sense.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.146
- So me, Cory, and Cody will be
battling out to see who's got

00:46.212 --> 00:48.181
the worst sense of touch
and the worst sense of smell.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.550
And the winner--or in this case
the loser--

00:50.617 --> 00:52.852
will be responsible
for cleaning the bathrooms.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.654
Are you guys ready to do it?
- Sounds perfect.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.557
- Here we go!

00:57.624 --> 00:58.992
- CODY: Ooh.
- Ooh.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.861
- TYLER: Thanks, Panda.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.263
Check your left foot, Panda.
- CODY: [laughs]

01:04.330 --> 01:09.135
- ♪

01:09.202 --> 01:12.572
♪ La, la, la,
here we go, go, go ♪

01:12.639 --> 01:15.241

01:15.308 --> 01:18.144
♪ La, la, la, here we go ♪♪

01:18.211 --> 01:20.613
- ♪

01:22.248 --> 01:25.018
- Gentlemen, welcome
to The Touch Test.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.252
- I don't like this, Gar.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.354
- Before we start,
just like to remind you

01:28.421 --> 01:30.089
that if you lose
this whole competition,

01:30.156 --> 01:32.392
you will be cleaning
the dirty bathroom.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.093
I know this is
stating the obvious,

01:34.160 --> 01:37.964
but in front of each of you
is a box with three holes in it.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.165
Rules are very simple.

01:39.232 --> 01:40.467
There will be three rounds.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.135
In each round, there will be
an opportunity

01:42.202 --> 01:44.170
to identify one object.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.005
We need you
to identify the object

01:46.072 --> 01:48.441
as your hand
is in the container.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.777
The person with the most points
at the end of three rounds

01:50.844 --> 01:51.945
will be the winner.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.346
- Is there anything alive
in my box?

01:53.413 --> 01:55.448
- I can neither confirm
nor deny that.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.083
Guys, I don't want
anybody injured,

01:57.150 --> 01:59.085
so let's be
as delicate as possible.

01:59.152 --> 02:02.722
Hey, and trust me,
I would not do any of this.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.691
- [laughing]

02:04.757 --> 02:05.758
Thank you.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.260
That's so comforting to hear.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.762
- Without further ado,
let's begin The Touch Test.

02:09.829 --> 02:12.031
Tyler, you're up first.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.399
- You gotta go
into it harmless.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.701
Harmless.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.002
[screaming]

02:16.069 --> 02:17.871
- [laughs] What happened?
What happened?

02:17.937 --> 02:18.972
Talk me through it.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.139
- Meatballs.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.141
- That is...correct.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.978
- Yes!
- Very nice.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.045
- Whoo.

02:26.112 --> 02:27.313
- My knee is shaking.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.782
- [laughing]

02:29.849 --> 02:32.118
- This is harder mentally
than I ever thought it would be.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.553
- Just go ahead,
you're making me wait.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.388
- We're all here for you.
We're cheering for you.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.257
Go there mentally. He's there.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.025
- Oh my gosh, he's going
in the box.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.793
- You cannot take
your hand out now.

02:40.860 --> 02:41.995
- You're in.
- You're in.

02:42.061 --> 02:43.863
- You cannot come
out of the box.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.934
- Hey, put your
hand in the box.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.870
Straight down.
Hey!

02:50.937 --> 02:52.372
- Oh God!

02:52.438 --> 02:55.642
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

02:55.708 --> 02:58.044
[laughs] What is it?

02:58.111 --> 02:59.045
- Cody!

02:59.112 --> 03:00.947
Put your hand down!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.049
Your hand is in a bowl
right now.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.651
You gotta figure out
what's in the bowl.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.085
What is it?
- Snake!

03:06.152 --> 03:07.820
Snake!
- Alright, Cody,

03:07.887 --> 03:09.222
that is incorrect.
- Okay.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.391
Whoo, I don't care, I survived.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.792
Great.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.528
I'm brave, okay?

03:15.595 --> 03:17.630
I'm a brave person.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.267
- Alright, you're in.
- Even the sock feels scary.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.169
- Oh gosh.
- It's kinda slimy.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.804
I've never felt
anything like it.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.240
- [laughing]

03:27.307 --> 03:28.741
- Alright, Cory,
I need a guess.

03:28.808 --> 03:29.742
- Worms.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.077
Worms and dirt and mud.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.879
- That is correct.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.681
- Uh.
- That was good.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.115
- [laughing]

03:36.182 --> 03:37.417
- Say something.

03:37.483 --> 03:40.086
- [laughing]

03:40.153 --> 03:41.821
- Uh, feathers.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.855
- Correct.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.824
- Nice, yes.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.858
- Very nice.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.360
- Oh, he's going for it.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.529
He's in.
- Oh, he's in.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.131
- It feels like a pot--
like made of pottery.

03:52.198 --> 03:53.199
Piggy bank.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.968
- Piggy bank, that is correct.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.102
Wow.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.937
Very nice.
- Yes.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.906
- Cory, you're up.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.708
His hands are there.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.710
He's there.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.112
- [laughs] It's liquidy.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.647
- [laughing]

04:07.714 --> 04:09.215
- Ah!

04:09.282 --> 04:11.884
Uh, all I can think of is egg.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.119
- Egg it is.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.221
Very nice.
- Very nice.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.856
- So, Tyler,
you have two points.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.991
Cody, you have one.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.459
Cory, you have two points.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.293
So that means, Tyler,
if you answer correctly,

04:21.361 --> 04:23.029
you officially eliminate Cody.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.032
Tyler, here we go.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.266
- He's in.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.468
I'd stay focused, Ty.

04:28.534 --> 04:29.969
- GARRETT: Yeah, I would
definitely stay focused.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.437
- [laughing]

04:31.504 --> 04:32.672
- What is happening in there?

04:32.739 --> 04:34.307
- Uh, it's alive.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.075
Whatever it is is alive.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.944
I lost it.
I don't know where it went.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.145
- Oh, you definitely
didn't lose it.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.313
- Is he moving?

04:40.380 --> 04:41.514
- Uh, it's--crickets.

04:41.581 --> 04:42.715
It's crickets.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.451
- That is correct.
- Wow!

04:45.518 --> 04:48.187
- Alright, Cody, you have
officially been eliminated.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.456
Please come stand by me.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.959
- At the end of the day,
I thought this might happen.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.261
But I did think I'd be leaving
with one less finger.

04:55.328 --> 04:58.231
I have 'em all, so at the end
of the day, I'm happy.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.499
- Cory,
if you get this right,

04:59.565 --> 05:01.000
we'll have to move
into a tiebreaker.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.370
If you get this wrong, you will
be officially eliminated

05:04.437 --> 05:07.774
and competing with Cody
to see who cleans the bathroom.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.709
- Bring it on, Cor.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.978
- There he goes, he's in.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.212
Oh, yeah.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.782
Oh, alright, he's there.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.650
Oh, oh gosh.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.019
Are you petting it?
What are you trying to do here?

05:20.086 --> 05:21.187
- Uh.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.089
- Alright, what is it?
What is it?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.691
- Uh, spaghetti noodles.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.826
- That is correct, wow.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.428
Very nice.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.197
We've officially moved
into a tiebreaker round.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.200
You guys each have
the same objects in your boxes.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.736
We'll be going two hands in
at one time.

05:36.803 --> 05:39.439
The first person to correctly
identify both objects

05:39.505 --> 05:41.074
will be the winner
of this competition.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.243
The loser will have to battle
Cody in the final competition,

05:44.310 --> 05:46.913
The Search and Sniff.
- Bang!

05:46.979 --> 05:48.381
- Let's do it.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.516
- Alright, you guys probably
need to replicate this motion.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.086
Three, two, one, go, okay?

05:53.152 --> 05:54.220
Here we go.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.724
Three, two, one, go.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.226
- Okay, Ty's in.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.695
- Cory has not touched
anything yet.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.097
Commit, dude.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.965
- Oh.
- Don't couch, just watch.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.300
- Okay, okay.

06:07.366 --> 06:08.801
- Frog and pickles.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.869
- [laughs]

06:09.936 --> 06:11.771
- Pickle left.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.607
What in the--chicken feet
and pickles.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.409
- [cheering]

06:16.476 --> 06:18.211

06:23.316 --> 06:24.917
Congratulations, Ty.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.452
You are now exempt
from cleaning the bathroom.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.987
Get on over here.
- Thank you.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.088

06:29.155 --> 06:30.323

06:30.389 --> 06:31.824
Hey, feels good
to be the winner.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.359
- No thanks.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.394
- Don't make me put you back
into that competition.

06:35.461 --> 06:38.064
Alright, boys, I know you guys
aren't excited about it,

06:38.131 --> 06:39.332
but let's go smell some stuff.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.113
Please stabilize the base, Cor.

- Three, two, one, launch away.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.809
The loser here will officially
be the most senseless dude

07:22.875 --> 07:24.377
and will be
cleaning the bathroom.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.045

07:26.112 --> 07:27.213
- GARRETT: For you.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.414
The rules are simple.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.683
We have 800 bags in this room.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.053
Ten of 'em having
the most stinky, putrid smells

07:34.120 --> 07:35.388
you have ever sniffed.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.557
The object is to find the bag
with the smell in it.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.792
You have one minute
to pick three bags.

07:39.859 --> 07:43.596
You are only using your noses
to find the stinky items.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.765
As soon as you touch a bag
with your hands,

07:45.832 --> 07:48.434
you have selected that bag
and will need to bring it

07:48.501 --> 07:50.503
to the table
and place it on your face.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.772

the final competition?

07:59.111 --> 08:01.180
- Yeah, I guess, let's get
this over with. It smells.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.082
- On my go.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.608
- Popcorn in the mouth,
jaw-drop moment.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.210
Yeah.

16:18.277 --> 16:19.878
- Oh yeah.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.915
- That was actually
a really good one.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.317
I didn't see what you saw
when you thought of this,

16:25.384 --> 16:27.086
but I get it now.
- Dude, you do?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.687
- I totally get it.
- Yeah.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.089
- Alright, we got
some good stuff.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.624
The only thing that I'm not
sure we thought through,

16:32.691 --> 16:35.761
how do these...go together?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.062
Ah, we can figure
that out later.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.430
Hey, good photos though.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.666
- That was a good day.
- We got some good stuff.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.034
- ♪

16:42.101 --> 16:44.002
- Let's see it
between the legs!

16:44.069 --> 16:46.472
- Oh!
- Okay, he's good.

16:46.538 --> 16:50.809
- ♪

16:50.876 --> 16:52.144

16:52.211 --> 16:53.879
- Uh, yeah, working on 'em now.

16:53.946 --> 16:54.847
- How do they look?

16:54.913 --> 16:56.181
- They're weird.

16:56.248 --> 16:57.616
- What do you mean
they're weird?

16:57.683 --> 16:58.984
I'm supposed to be on a horse.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.086
- I know. Now I've gotta find
a picture of a horse

17:01.153 --> 17:02.154
and add it under you.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.289
- I don't want
just a normal horse.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.090
You need to make it.
Look, here's what I'm thinking.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.326
- Should I write this down?

17:07.393 --> 17:09.361
- Probably, if you're not
gonna remember all this.

17:09.428 --> 17:10.796
- Okay.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.999
- I'm thinking like me dunking
like slammer-jammer dunk fest

17:14.066 --> 17:15.800
right over LeBron James.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.002
What do--I mean, you tell me.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.739
You go with what you wanna do,
but that to me is

17:20.806 --> 17:23.709
the centerpiece of the photo.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.109
- So like in the center?

17:25.176 --> 17:28.647
- Well, not center,
but like middle.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.549
- Okay.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.752
- What I see in my head mostly
is me jumping a Yeti.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.053
- Yeti, alright.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.222
And then you're like
robbing a bank?

17:37.289 --> 17:38.924
Is it a bank heist or something?

17:38.991 --> 17:40.859
- Remember, billboard
movie-style poster.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.294
- Right, right.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.396
- I'm really picturing more
like a lifesaving mission.

17:44.463 --> 17:47.499
Realistically, I just
saved someone's life.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.801
- Oh gosh, slow down.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.903
- Just write
"saving someone's life."

17:50.969 --> 17:52.271
- Saving someone's life.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.473
- And then if you write
Yeti under that in all caps.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.975
- I'm on a horse that's
maybe like a hybrid.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.378
Kinda mean looking,
but also that respects me.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.181
I just jumped on his back,
he's going crazy.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.283
Nah-ah, and I'm fighting him.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.385
And I'm saying,
"I'm gonna go fast, Daddy.

18:06.452 --> 18:07.386
Let's go fast."

18:07.453 --> 18:08.854
- Kinda like--

18:08.921 --> 18:10.055
- What?

18:10.122 --> 18:12.157
Are you kidding me right now?

18:12.224 --> 18:13.258
We're in trouble.

18:13.325 --> 18:16.662
- No, just like imagine like--

18:16.728 --> 18:18.096
- It's not getting any better.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.598
- Look at the guns, dude.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.601
Like I'm not even flexing,
that's just like my natural

18:22.668 --> 18:23.869
toned bod.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.071
That's easy on the eyes,
if you know what I'm saying.

18:26.138 --> 18:29.107
- The blue rope that's kinda
wrapped around my arm.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.509
If you wanna
turn that into a snake,

18:30.576 --> 18:34.313
I've been known
to climb with snakes.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.149
- I think anybody
can hold onto a ladder.

18:37.216 --> 18:40.185
It takes a lot of skill
to jump multiple Yeti.

18:40.252 --> 18:43.255
- Okay, well, we've gone
from one Yeti to four Yetis.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.524
- And, Chad, I would expect
mine to be a little bit

18:45.591 --> 18:47.025
larger in scale
than everybody else's.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.861
- Coby's can be the largest,
but make sure mine

18:48.927 --> 18:50.395
is the direct center
of the picture.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.664
- I'm actually cool if you put
Cory's picture in the center,

18:52.731 --> 18:55.033
as long as my photo
goes on top of his photo.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.536
- --doesn't even make sense.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.372
- If my horse happens to be
like rearing back

19:00.439 --> 19:02.274
and like trampling maybe
one of the other guys,

19:02.341 --> 19:03.575
then that's great.
- Okay.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.711
- I mean, just the way
the color of the shorts

19:05.777 --> 19:08.213
and the athleticism,
like this guy's the MVP.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.882
- I keep coming back
to this one though.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.016
- What?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.484
It looks like
I'm swimming upstream.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.620
That was an accident.
- Well, this one,

19:14.686 --> 19:16.588
I feel like I have a little more
creative control.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.724
- To do what?

19:18.790 --> 19:19.892
- Don't worry.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.226
You're gonna be memorable.

19:21.293 --> 19:22.961
I've got this.
- That's all I need, baby.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.264
- Honestly, I don't--wherever
you have to put me, it's fine.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.900
But if the middle and big works,
I think that'd be a good spot.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.902
- Okay.
- I trust you.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.404
- You have tons
of artistic talent.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.406
Whatever you decide,
as long as it's real similar

19:34.473 --> 19:36.775
to what I suggested, I'll be
totally great with.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.977
- I wanted to keep it simple,
I'm glad we did.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.113
- Cool, thanks, dude.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.614

19:42.681 --> 19:44.850
