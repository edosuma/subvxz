WEBVTT

00:11.098 --> 00:14.231
There's the boss
himself, Serano.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.540
Hey, who's the other guy?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.198
Uh, Micki, who is that?

00:24.241 --> 00:25.677
Who's that other guy?

00:25.721 --> 00:27.723
It's the one that got away.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.163
There she is.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.991
Yvette.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.689
Been hearing about
you for so long,

00:37.733 --> 00:40.170
it kind of feels like...

00:40.214 --> 00:41.389
like I know you.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.179
Spider-- rest in peace--

00:49.223 --> 00:51.399
he spoke very highly of you.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.795
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:56.839 --> 00:59.668
GM here helps with
personnel decisions.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.191
Among other things.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.115
All right, Walker,

01:12.159 --> 01:13.290
keep your eye
on our two bodyguards.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.813
If there is any sign

01:14.857 --> 01:16.380
Yep.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.686
On it, Cap.

01:17.729 --> 01:18.730
We heard all about
your little stunt

01:18.774 --> 01:20.471
getting Spider's car back.

01:20.515 --> 01:21.733
And it's a good thing you did.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.953
Yeah? It wasn't for Spider.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.433
Well, reputation's one thing.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.870
Meeting you face-to-face--
that's another.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.872
I was glad you finally called.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.134
You seem pretty eager to work

01:31.178 --> 01:34.094
your way up the crew,
huh, Yvette?

01:37.009 --> 01:39.534
Hey, Cap.
Noting a "sign of trouble."

01:40.491 --> 01:42.232
I need to make some real money.

01:42.276 --> 01:43.581
And I like a challenge.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.148
Micki, I want you
to get out of there right now.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.933
That's why you joined
the military.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.022
Spider was an over-sharer.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.154
Yeah, I know the type.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.590
I had a real
wild childhood.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.244
Always ran with
the wrong crew.

01:54.288 --> 01:57.160
Was hoping the military could
help me channel that energy

01:57.204 --> 01:59.206
in the right way,
but...
Crime pays.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.642
It sure does.

02:00.685 --> 02:01.947
What other jobs
you do before you...

02:01.991 --> 02:03.340
rolled into Del Rio?

02:04.428 --> 02:05.734
Don't worry about them.

02:05.777 --> 02:08.128
It's just a little game
they like to play.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.520
Robbery crew in Dallas.

02:09.564 --> 02:12.262
Some wheel work in OKC.

02:12.306 --> 02:15.091
Did time in Hilltop...
Oh.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.832
Who was the warden then?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.667
Boudreaux.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.495
He's a real bastard.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.845
She's not wrong.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.370
I don't get it.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.763
A girl as pretty as you--

02:34.806 --> 02:37.069
you must be breaking hearts
all across this state.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.636
Are you dating anybody?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.465
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.553
Micki, what the hell
are you doing?

02:42.597 --> 02:43.641
Maybe the two of you

02:43.685 --> 02:44.990
should keep your eyes
on your boss

02:45.034 --> 02:46.166
instead of playing
with your squirt guns.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.218
We got a live one here, boss.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.654
Yvette!
Where have you been?

02:56.698 --> 02:58.178
'Cause we could've used you
a couple of months ago.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.657
Yeah? What was
a couple months ago?

02:59.701 --> 03:02.399
Ah, a little problem
we're still cleaning up.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.402
Well, I'm your girl.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.491
GM, why don't you
show her around?

03:07.535 --> 03:09.493
But you stay
in touch.

03:09.537 --> 03:12.453
I might need
the both of you later. Let's go.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.377
Let's get you up to speed,
Yvette.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.469
On the move, Cap.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.035
Micki, we'll be watching.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.084
And here comes the heartburn.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.228
I just want to point out
that I'm here in detention

03:48.271 --> 03:49.838
because I got punched
in the face.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.143
What? No, no, no.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.841
You almost ran over my sister
with your car.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.191
No, no-- she accused me of
doing something I didn't do.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.149
And that was
your response?

03:57.193 --> 04:00.805
I was wrong. But so were you
for what you said.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.199
Can we just skip to the end
of <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

04:03.243 --> 04:05.506
You know, where all the
archetypes start to get along?

04:05.549 --> 04:06.289
Archetypes?

04:06.333 --> 04:09.292
You know, the cool girl...

04:09.336 --> 04:12.382
The film geek...Music is-is more my jam now.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.775
The beautiful idiot...

04:13.818 --> 04:15.777
Okay, you have got to stop
calling yourself that.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.866
The beautiful,
misunderstood idiot.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.346
And...

04:19.389 --> 04:21.217
The one who shouldn't be here.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.566
Okay, fine, Walker.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.003
I get it.
But I need you to call me.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.570
All right?

04:28.311 --> 04:29.617
Okay.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.228
There seems to be some
communication issues

04:32.272 --> 04:33.316
that we need to...

04:33.360 --> 04:34.665
August.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.928
Eyes on me.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.193
There seems to be some
communication issues

04:41.237 --> 04:43.370
that we need to deal with.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.024
So, change in plans.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.287
Field trip?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.418
No, Todd.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.594
We're going to do
a training exercise.

04:50.638 --> 04:53.162
Something I picked up
in the military.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.426
On your feet. Let's go!

05:03.172 --> 05:05.130
Micki, we lost visual.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.481
Wouldn't mind you looping us
in on your location.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.877
Ramirez?

05:12.921 --> 05:13.922
Hey.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.751
Who was this, uh,
this-this "GM"?

05:16.794 --> 05:18.448
You ever hear about him
in your meet-ups?

05:18.492 --> 05:19.971
Not once, no.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.670
Sent Ranger HQ some snapshots
of his smug mug, though.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.324
- He was smug, wasn't he?
- Very smug.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.890
Very s...I mean, what was
this thing about

05:25.934 --> 05:28.893
the... "the one that got away"?

05:28.937 --> 05:30.808
Actually, she said,
"the one <i>who</i> got away."

05:30.852 --> 05:32.854
The one-- Are we doing
- this right now?
- I'm just saying what she said.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.159
You lose Micki

05:34.203 --> 05:35.465
- and we're doing this?
- I lost Micki?

05:39.687 --> 05:41.732
You, uh, want to
listen to some music?

05:41.776 --> 05:44.518
There's a mix CD in here
I think you'd...

05:46.171 --> 05:47.738
Relax.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.045
Your little friends in your ear,
they can't hear us in here.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.964
Micki Ramirez.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.532
It's been a long time, right?

06:01.839 --> 06:04.233
Garrison,
why am I not surprised

06:04.276 --> 06:06.148
that you're somehow
wrapped up in all this?

06:06.191 --> 06:08.237
You always said that I was
destined for a life of crime.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.021
I didn't really want
to disappoint you.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.154
Well, you did.
14 years ago.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.677
Always was one last job,

06:13.721 --> 06:16.376
and it didn't matter
how dangerous or selfish.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.855
You know that's why I left.

06:17.899 --> 06:21.381
Funny how life brought you
right back here, huh?

06:21.424 --> 06:24.209
- Together again.
- Hilarious.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.256
Why didn't you give me up
back there with Serano?

06:31.303 --> 06:32.914
You want out, don't you?

06:33.741 --> 06:34.785
When my girlfriend...

06:34.829 --> 06:36.439
Ex-girlfriend.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.398
That's right. When
my ex-girlfriend

06:38.441 --> 06:41.531
turns out to be a Texas Ranger
who's about to take down Serano,

06:41.575 --> 06:43.315
yeah, I-I saw an opportunity.

06:43.359 --> 06:44.708
Well, if you're willing to talk,

06:44.752 --> 06:46.536
I'm guessing it's because
you want a deal.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.105
You still get me.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.941
<i>Maybe she went radio silence</i>

06:59.984 --> 07:01.551
for a reason.
She's a good Ranger.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.597
No, I know she's a good Ranger.
Okay? But

07:03.640 --> 07:05.337
going undercover...
it's a different beast.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.383
Let's just trust her a beat,
- all right?
- I do trust her.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.211
All right, look.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.647
Well, why didn't you trust me?

07:10.691 --> 07:12.344
- What are you talking about?
- About your theory

07:12.388 --> 07:14.172
on the sniper in Austin.
I was a target, too.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.131
So help me understand
why you didn't trust me.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.481
I had a protective
detail on you.
I know you did.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.569
I-I know that now.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.136
But why didn't you
tell me before?

07:21.179 --> 07:23.094
Because I didn't want you
spiraling out again, all right?

07:26.315 --> 07:29.492
That lone wolf, blinders on
to the world routine is done.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.972
We can't have it anymore.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.017
Yeah, I get it.
And I don't want that either.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.671
And that's-that's why
I'm here, Cap.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.717
I don't want to see the same
damn thing happen to Micki.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.551
<i>Walker,</i>

07:44.594 --> 07:46.204
Captain James.
You copy?

07:47.423 --> 07:49.556
Ramirez, where the hell are you?
We lost comms.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.819
I'm with Serano's advisor.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.734
Hey, Micki, who is this guy?

07:53.777 --> 07:55.997
This, uh, this GM?
What's his deal?

07:57.433 --> 07:58.869
I can't tell yet, but...

07:58.913 --> 08:00.958
he's been working
with Serano for years.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.743
He knows the operation. And...

08:02.786 --> 08:04.614
I think he wants out.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.311
Might even be willing to talk.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.183
You want to make him a CI
after one meeting?

08:08.226 --> 08:10.141
- That's a little risky.
- I understand

08:10.185 --> 08:13.057
your concern, Cap,
but this is why I'm here.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.842
I think I can
work him for intel.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.017
Maybe even about

08:16.060 --> 08:18.193
Serano ordering
that hit in Austin.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.021
I just need more time
to see if he can be trusted.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.370
Trust me?

08:21.413 --> 08:24.025
No, no, no.
I need to trust you.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.679
Hey, Micki, where are you now?

08:25.722 --> 08:27.637
I'll touch base later.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.422
No, Ramirez. Wait. Ramir..

08:30.466 --> 08:32.729
She's hiding something.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.775
I did, when I was under.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.172
I am about to knock that smile
off your face.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.609
This isn't a game.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.828
I need actionable intel
or I'm going to arrest

08:44.872 --> 08:46.438
- your ass right now.
- Okay.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.310
Hand to God,

08:48.353 --> 08:50.834
I'm about to perform a miracle.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.358
You gotta be kidding me.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.577
Nope.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.232
Yet again, things come
full circle.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.625
You're under arrest.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.930
No, I'm not.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.325
Plus, you don't have
cuffs or a gun.
Maybe.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.849
But I have combat skills
and unfinished business.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.416
Oh, okay, Yvette.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.853
The key to everything that
you want is just inside, though.

09:09.897 --> 09:10.854
Inside the same church

09:10.898 --> 09:12.464
we were supposed
to be married in?

09:12.508 --> 09:14.771
Same church you left me waiting.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.078
A heartbroken
young man of 19

09:17.121 --> 09:20.211
stood right here,
pining for his one true love.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.779
Why are we really here?

09:24.172 --> 09:25.608
Like I said.

09:25.652 --> 09:26.957
The key's inside.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.705
...and I stole a squirt gun
when I was a kid

09:35.749 --> 09:37.054
and I blamed it
on my brother.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.926
Garrison, we don't
have time for this.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.711
Patience is a virtue,
Micki. Okay.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.800
Fine, I'll skip ahead.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.064
Listen, I never hurt anybody.

09:47.108 --> 09:50.198
Okay, listen, I never
hurt anybody physically.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.330
But I feel like

09:52.374 --> 09:53.636
I need to be forgiven

09:53.680 --> 09:56.204
for the emotional damage
- that I've caused.
- Huh.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.249
Not to mention
the physical damage I'll cause

09:58.293 --> 09:59.773
if you don't start
giving me answers.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.602
You think that
this is a trap?

10:02.645 --> 10:05.561
You really always have
had trust issues.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.867
We are in
the Lord's house, Micki.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.912
We are safe and sound.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.044
My God.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.698
Nothing's changed.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.178
Some people never move on,
I guess.

10:16.093 --> 10:18.226
Micki, I meant what I said.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.795
I am sorry.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.797
I'm sorry for everything
that I did to you.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.537
And I'm sorry about
the life that I've led.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.191
But you can save me.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.802
I can try.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.107
But you gotta give me something.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.109
Okay, okay. I will.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.243
Listen, just imagine

10:35.286 --> 10:37.898
the big warehouse at
the end of <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

10:37.941 --> 10:39.377
And...
Last chance.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.162
Okay. Okay.
Why are we here?

10:41.205 --> 10:44.382
I have evidence of every crime
Serano committed.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.170
Money laundering,
drug trafficking,

10:49.213 --> 10:50.954
and ordering that hit in Austin.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.216
Wait, so you do know about that.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.741
Of course I do.
I advised him against it.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.351
I thought it
would just bring

10:56.394 --> 10:58.658
too much heat on us,
but he was paranoid.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.921
He said that the whole operation
was about to get taken down,

11:00.964 --> 11:03.010
and now look.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.882
I am in confession
with a Texas Ranger.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.058
And you can prove all of this?

11:08.102 --> 11:09.364
Yes.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.544
And I can prove
Serano killed Spider.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.024
Micki, he was
my friend, too.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.547
I should've been
there that night.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.376
And if Serano had him killed,

11:21.419 --> 11:23.726
then it's...
then it's only a matter of time

11:23.770 --> 11:25.423
before...

11:26.555 --> 11:27.817
How?

11:27.861 --> 11:29.558
How can you prove all this?

11:29.601 --> 11:30.951
You are about
to find out.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.605
Are you two here for Pre-Cana?

11:33.649 --> 11:35.564
Yes.
No.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.914
Yes, Father, we are.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.225
Hey.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.661
Trey. Again.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.880
He is asking for updates.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.925
- What do I tell him?
- Nothing. Yet.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.362
We should loop Liam in
on all this, though.

11:51.406 --> 11:54.409
Yeah. Uh... probably best
to cover our bases

11:54.452 --> 11:56.237
and get the new DA
up to speed, as well.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.934
What, you're a team player now?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.066
There's still some lingering
tensions,

11:59.109 --> 12:00.415
yeah, but I--
but I figure

12:00.458 --> 12:01.895
we should try and
work together on this.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.766
See it from all angles.
Lessons learned,

12:03.810 --> 12:05.072
remember?

12:05.115 --> 12:06.769
All right, here we go.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.946
Well, that's a warm welcome,
you keeping me up to speed.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.514
So, where are we at?

12:12.557 --> 12:15.952
Ramirez made contact
with Serano.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.172
She's working a CI right now.
We sent some

12:18.215 --> 12:19.695
surveillance to Ranger HQ.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.914
Hey, Denise-- uh,

12:20.957 --> 12:22.611
DA Davidson--

12:22.654 --> 12:23.917
has Liam

12:23.960 --> 12:25.440
brought you
up to speed on Serano?

12:25.483 --> 12:27.485
Oh, I am well aware
of Thomas Serano.

12:27.529 --> 12:28.617
His drug ops

12:28.660 --> 12:29.966
caused plenty of havoc
up in Thalia

12:30.010 --> 12:31.881
where I last worked.
Managed to avoid prosecution

12:31.925 --> 12:33.274
on any felony charges.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.276
Do we have any admission
of guilt on a wire?

12:35.319 --> 12:37.887
Anything to tie him
to the Austin sniper?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.149
Not yet, no.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.152
So, where is Ranger Ramirez now?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.895
She's...She's with the potential CI.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.331
Uh, she's currently off comms.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.985
I feel I need to point out

12:49.029 --> 12:50.465
that my brother
may have been a target

12:50.508 --> 12:52.336
in the shooting
three months ago,

12:52.380 --> 12:54.121
so his presence in Del Rio
is a concern.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.949
Yeah, uh...

12:55.992 --> 12:58.386
Okay, while I appreciate
your concern, Counselor,

12:58.429 --> 13:01.563
but having spent a considerable
amount of time undercover,

13:01.606 --> 13:02.825
Ranger Walker has
a unique perspective

13:02.869 --> 13:04.131
on undercover operations.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.089
I have to say
he's our best shot.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.222
One thing I think

13:08.265 --> 13:10.180
we need to identify
who this informant is

13:10.224 --> 13:12.139
and find out
if he can be trusted.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.531
We're on it.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.062
Aha.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.283
Smug mug.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.242
It's all about trust,

13:28.285 --> 13:29.852
a failure to communicate.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.158
So...

13:31.201 --> 13:32.768
we're gonna work on
a little team building.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.943
Oh, no.

13:33.987 --> 13:34.901
All right,
all right, all right.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.207
Calm down. All right?

13:37.251 --> 13:40.123
August, Todd, you're gonna
be in locker room one.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.343
Stella and Colton,
locker room two.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.520
You like those signs?
I made 'em.

13:45.563 --> 13:48.262
Now, each room has
several doors.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.787
Obviously, these doors
right here are already unlocked.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.267
But there's gonna be

13:53.310 --> 13:54.964
one door on the inside
that is locked.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.924
And the key is hidden
in your respective rooms.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.535
- So it's like an escape room.
- Exactly.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.971
But one built on trust.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.625
Communication.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.106
Now, look,
you're more than welcome

14:06.149 --> 14:08.282
to just walk right outside
these open doors

14:08.325 --> 14:11.285
and go back to detention
for the next six hours.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.896
Or...
you find the key,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.158
unlock the door

14:15.202 --> 14:16.899
and you're free to go home.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.335
Are there any more clues?

14:18.379 --> 14:21.991
Only that the history with
your partner holds the key.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.210
Wow.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.212
All right, let's go.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.649
Come on, you two.

14:27.692 --> 14:31.305
Get a little bit more
pep in your step! Let's go!

14:31.348 --> 14:34.482
Best of luck.
I'll be waiting.

14:35.483 --> 14:38.486
We intended to tie the
knot a long time ago

14:38.529 --> 14:40.575
and after 12...
Fourteen.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.576
...14 years,

14:41.619 --> 14:43.578
we are finally
ready to do it.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.710
Well, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.321
Oh, I bet that's
not the first time

14:47.364 --> 14:48.539
you've used that one, Father.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.977
Well...

14:51.020 --> 14:52.935
let me see our availability.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.024
Okay, Mondays
look good.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.939
And Tuesday
afternoon...

14:56.983 --> 14:59.637
Church bookkeeper cooks
the books for Serano.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.726
Long story.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.945
Trust me?

15:02.989 --> 15:04.425
Nope.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.949
Yeah, but you're
getting there. Right?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.951
- Ready?
- What?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.910
- Where are we going?
- My place.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.173
I have something
to show you.

15:16.306 --> 15:17.786
This is your place?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.005
Don't act so surprised.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.571
Nah, this is
just my face.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.878
No, this is your face looking
at my tasteful digs.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.576
Hah. And you
ruined it.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.056
Huh.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.580
Nice place, Garrison.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.365
Oh.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.802
Well, heya, Micki.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.935
We have a couple of questions.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.162
Is there any reason

15:46.206 --> 15:48.599
why you didn't feel the need
to share the fact that

15:48.643 --> 15:49.949
you knew each other?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.863
If I told you
before I questioned him myself,

15:51.907 --> 15:53.300
you would've stopped me
before I even had a chance.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.432
Questioned him?
That's what you're calling

15:55.476 --> 15:57.260
- your little joyride around town?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.870
Am I being lectured
by the poster boy

15:58.914 --> 16:00.220
of withholding information?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.004
Excuse me, third graders.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.441
Can we keep this
about him, please?

16:05.225 --> 16:07.836
Listen, if I'm calling the DA
and asking for protection,

16:07.879 --> 16:09.446
you're gonna need
to tell me exactly

16:09.490 --> 16:11.535
- what evidence you have.
- I have a key,

16:11.579 --> 16:13.276
right here,

16:13.320 --> 16:14.669
that will tie Serano
to a laundry list

16:14.712 --> 16:16.062
of crimes
he has committed statewide.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.107
- You have a key?
- Mm-hmm.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.326
Hey, Walker, he has a key.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.980
- Oh, he has a key.
- Yes, he has a key.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.546
Oh, great.
What's it a key to?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.289
I... I can't tell you that

16:26.333 --> 16:27.638
until you get me immunity.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.118
Are we really
talking about

16:29.162 --> 16:30.424
cutting a deal with this guy?

16:30.467 --> 16:31.686
You really don't have to.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.035
But Serano is closing
the circle.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.081
Which means he's
destroying evidence.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.821
Which means
the clock is ticking.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.301
Okay, how do you know this?

16:38.345 --> 16:40.303
Bumping off his own people is

16:40.347 --> 16:42.044
a sure-as-shinola sign
that Serano thinks

16:42.088 --> 16:43.480
the walls are
closing in.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.569
But it started
way before that.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.701
Since Austin.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.622
Felt like I...
just got the sky

16:54.665 --> 16:56.667
all wrong.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.235
I miss our
drink and ink nights.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.672
Hey.
Hey. Go back.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.674
What about Austin?

17:03.718 --> 17:06.329
That's when Serano started
getting paranoid.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.852
After you arrested Stan.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.291
That's why he wanted
to take you out.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.597
You were a thorn in his side
and all of Northside Nation.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.122
What does Northside Nation
have to do with it?

17:16.165 --> 17:17.297
Serano runs the Northside.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.820
Stan Morrison worked for him.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.829
I guess I gave you
that one for free.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.135
Okay.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.311
You can prove all of this?

17:32.138 --> 17:33.356
- Yeah.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.792
If you can get me...

17:34.836 --> 17:37.621
Immunity.
All right, all right. All right.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.277
He could've told
Serano who I was.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.894
I'm calling the DA's office.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.809
Mr. Murphy, we'd be willing
to make you a deal

17:51.853 --> 17:54.508
Who was the Austin sniper?

17:56.510 --> 17:59.034
Matt Phillips. Aka Spider.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.210
What? No. That's not possible.

18:01.254 --> 18:02.255
Micki...

18:02.298 --> 18:04.605
Didn't you suspect him yourself?

18:04.648 --> 18:07.434
Yeah, early on,
but he wasn't a killer.

18:07.477 --> 18:08.522
And he was trying
to get out.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.176
And he had problems
with his vision.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.438
That's probably
why he missed.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.309
Another botched job

18:13.353 --> 18:14.615
in a growing list of screw-ups.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.138
It's probably why
Serano killed him.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.186
Look, I-I liked Spider, too.
I did.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.492
But... it's the truth.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.928
Okay.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.496
Where is the evidence
that can prove any of this?

18:27.410 --> 18:28.629
Uh, there's a key

18:28.672 --> 18:30.370
that is to an accounting
office downtown.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.980
They have all
the financial records

18:32.023 --> 18:33.938
of Northside's operations.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.375
They laundered
all of Serano's funny money.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.725
And I can tell you
about the offshore accounts.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.119
But I'm gonna need that deal.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.209
Okay. If Serano is
closing up shop,

18:43.252 --> 18:45.124
then time is of the essence.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.821
Mr. Murphy,
you have yourself a deal.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.736
But if any of this turns
into a wild goose chase,

18:48.779 --> 18:50.346
I will make sure that you are

18:50.390 --> 18:51.565
put away forever.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.480
That's something
I'd like to avoid.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.786
- Stay in touch, Captain.
- Yeah.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.575
I'm sorry,
you've been here a week,

19:01.618 --> 19:03.359
you're already making
a deal with a CI

19:03.403 --> 19:05.796
who had a previous relationship
with Ranger Ramirez?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.755
- You don't trust her?
- She's in too deep.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.322
And I've seen firsthand
what happens

19:09.365 --> 19:11.498
to someone when they've
been under for too long.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.152
Fair point.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.283
Any other concerns?

19:14.327 --> 19:15.937
Del Rio is in
Val Verde County.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.504
It's not even
our jurisdiction.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.245
Which is why
I'm headed there right now.

19:19.288 --> 19:22.030
To loop in their DA.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.118
Wait. What?

19:24.380 --> 19:26.600
You're going to Del Rio?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.777
Liam, I share
your concerns.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.082
Which is why
I want to be there,

19:31.126 --> 19:32.606
to make sure that nobody
screws this up.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.042
But we have
the chance

19:34.085 --> 19:36.523
to take down the head
of Northside Nation.

19:36.566 --> 19:39.178
So I hope that's a goal
that we can work together on.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.534
Ugh.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.449
I wonder how long
we'll smell like socks.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.626
Where
is this key?

19:53.453 --> 19:55.542
So, uh,
what's with Colton?

19:55.585 --> 19:56.934
His family and yours
don't get along?

19:56.978 --> 20:00.851
Yeah. My grandma broke up
with their grandpa

20:00.895 --> 20:02.418
and then they blamed us
for some fire

20:02.462 --> 20:03.593
that happened, like,
decades ago.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.987
Oh. Abby the heartbreaker, huh?

20:06.901 --> 20:08.076
Guess it runs in the family.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.644
Ruby.
Spirit week last year.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.168
You know
she ditched me for you, right?

20:13.212 --> 20:17.259
Yeah. I'm... I'm really
sorry about that, dude

20:17.303 --> 20:18.782
Ah, no. Not your fault, man.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.915
We were all better
when we were friends.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.178
Heads up.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.267
Oh, dude.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.269
Ah...

20:27.313 --> 20:28.792
You know, Coach Trey said that

20:28.836 --> 20:30.620
"your history with your partner
holds the key."

20:31.665 --> 20:33.232
Maybe that's why
he paired us together.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.972
To talk about Ruby?

20:35.016 --> 20:36.147
Yeah, I...

20:36.191 --> 20:37.366
I don't know, maybe--

20:37.410 --> 20:38.541
maybe it can help us
find the key somehow.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.847
Um...

20:39.890 --> 20:41.457
- We met in the A/
- V club.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.895
And the-the three of us
filmed those games, remember?

20:44.939 --> 20:46.114
Look.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.726
Oh...

20:51.293 --> 20:52.512
There's hundreds of 'em.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.774
Yeah.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.558
What was
the first one we filmed?

20:55.602 --> 20:56.864
Stafford.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.474
I hooked up with one
of their cheerleaders.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.650
It was memorable.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.131
Uh, good to know.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.481
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

21:05.525 --> 21:07.353
- Let's go!
- Let's go, baby.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.316
Congratulations. You're free.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.491
Thank you.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.058
- Hey, thank you as well.
- Let's go.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.670
How you doing in there?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.237
Ooh, how do you think?

21:22.281 --> 21:25.240
I think you need to work
on your communication skills.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.286
Maybe with your cellmate?

21:28.548 --> 21:32.334
We may as well try and find
the stupid key together.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.251
Oh, fine.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.210
Why are you so angry?

21:39.254 --> 21:43.563
Oh, probably my parents' divorce
and general anxiety issues.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.352
I'm sorry.
Not having

21:50.396 --> 21:53.094
your parents together--
it's hard. I get it.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.270
No, no, no. I...
I don't want them together.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.706
That's-that's the point.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.229
They'd be happier apart,

21:58.273 --> 22:00.710
and now they're gonna put me
in the middle of it all.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.060
Have you tried talking
to them about it?

22:04.453 --> 22:06.716
Look, can we not do this part?

22:08.196 --> 22:10.241
Cool?

22:17.248 --> 22:19.163
<i>Okay, so the top floor</i>

22:19.207 --> 22:21.252
is like a data farm.
You're gonna need a zip drive.

22:21.296 --> 22:23.254
If they haven't wiped
the files already.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.952
The search warrant is
to obtain all the files

22:24.995 --> 22:26.910
for companies
affiliated with Serano.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.390
And that means
we're gonna need the names

22:28.434 --> 22:30.261
of all the shell companies
Northside Nation was using.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.350
And this?

22:31.393 --> 22:32.873
Bottom floor, archives.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.570
There's windows
on the side of the building.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.093
It opens up
to an old-school records room.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.487
Kind of like the room
at the end of <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

22:38.531 --> 22:39.880
Where do I look?

22:39.923 --> 22:41.795
- Austin Eyes and Ears, Inc.
- Yeah.

22:41.838 --> 22:42.926
Yeah, let's go.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.406
Well, hey, hey, what?

22:44.450 --> 22:45.538
You're not going in.

22:45.581 --> 22:48.410
I'm a Ranger with a warrant.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.151
Northside had people
in the hospital

22:50.194 --> 22:51.674
when I got Carlos Mendoza.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.198
He could have people there now,
and if they see a Ranger

22:54.242 --> 22:55.374
flash a badge, it...

22:55.417 --> 22:56.592
Not good. I agree.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.899
Shut up.
You're both going in, all right?

22:58.942 --> 23:01.467
Walker, by the books.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.904
Micki, you get to be
- Yvette one last time.
- Okay, Cap,

23:03.947 --> 23:05.558
- are you sure about this?
- Listen.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.343
Everybody gets one last time,
all right?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.606
Technically,
whatever she finds

23:10.650 --> 23:12.434
is admissible as
part of the search.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.740
- Yes, sir.
- All right, let's do it.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.089
Be careful.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.382
Howdy.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.862
How can I help you?

23:48.905 --> 23:50.907
Cordell Walker, Texas Rangers.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.954
Uh, I have a warrant for you
to hand over any e-files

23:53.997 --> 23:57.436
in connection with a suspect
currently under investigation.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.356
Texas Rangers.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.532
Yes, ma'am.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.316
Which files?

24:08.359 --> 24:09.970
Austin Eyes and Ears, Inc.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.842
- Follow me.
- You got it.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.741
Yvette?

24:42.829 --> 24:44.091
What are you doing here?

24:44.134 --> 24:45.788
Serano sent me.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.617
No, he didn't.

25:21.911 --> 25:26.220
- Cuffs! Cuffs!
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.614
I got it.
We got to get out of here.

25:28.657 --> 25:29.658
Come on.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.791
Come on!

25:31.834 --> 25:34.533
- We got to go!
- Let's go.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.360
A fire's spreading
to the top floor.

25:36.404 --> 25:37.753
Send all units in the area.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.973
Is Cordell in there?
Are they both in there?

25:40.016 --> 25:41.801
Serano sent someone
to destroy the evidence.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.629
We got to get in there
right now.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.805
Just stay where you are.

25:45.848 --> 25:47.458
You need to do something!

25:50.026 --> 25:51.854
I'm going in.

26:22.885 --> 26:26.889
You were, uh, talking
about your mom earlier, right?

26:27.673 --> 26:29.892
You know about that?

26:31.502 --> 26:34.854
Well, our parents
grew up together, so...

26:34.897 --> 26:36.595
Anyway, um...

26:38.640 --> 26:40.120
I'm-I'm sorry.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.165
I shouldn't complain
about living parents

26:42.209 --> 26:44.646
who fight over idiotic crap.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.169
Yeah.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.432
What I wouldn't give for a fight

26:48.476 --> 26:50.434
about who takes out the trash.

26:50.478 --> 26:54.308
That's reductive, but thanks.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.226
Wait, Barnett knows

26:59.269 --> 27:02.272
our folks know each other,
right?

27:03.056 --> 27:05.275
Shared history.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.932
Try locker 101.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.718
It's the military call code
for poor communication.

27:12.761 --> 27:13.980
10-1.

27:14.023 --> 27:17.592
Coach Trey is a vet and a dork.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.555
- Music theory?
- Well, I-I told

27:24.599 --> 27:26.557
the principal I was interested
when I transferred.

27:26.601 --> 27:27.907
It's-it's whatever.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.434
Success.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.700
Okay, that's just creepy
you're standing right there.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.789
I'm literally not supposed
to be doing anything else

27:40.833 --> 27:41.877
but watching you guys.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.139
It's detention.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.880
But, hey, looks
like it's over.

27:44.924 --> 27:48.057
Go on. Enjoy your lives. Go.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.939
Damn it.

28:01.549 --> 28:04.595
Okay. What else do we have?

28:05.596 --> 28:06.902
You have me.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.904
Walker, come on, y...You know it's true, Micki.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.646
And I'm down here. I'm not
letting you go this solo.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.517
If Serano is taking
out his own people,

28:13.561 --> 28:15.171
chances are
he still wants me dead.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.478
And I'm here now, on his turf.
More of a threat.

28:17.521 --> 28:19.132
So you want to put a
target on yourself?

28:19.175 --> 28:22.091
When I came down here
to prevent exactly that?

28:22.135 --> 28:23.223
Hey, Micki's right.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.528
The last three months
are a waste

28:24.572 --> 28:26.313
if we just put you
in the crosshairs.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.054
It's not a waste if it works.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.882
We need to get this done.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.275
Hey, Micki?

28:32.319 --> 28:34.408
You should take a look at this.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.242
We're gonna have

28:42.285 --> 28:43.547
to move forward
without that evidence.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.027
It's shot.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.595
I'm open to any ideas.

28:49.379 --> 28:52.121
I'm your huckleberry.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.428
What?

28:55.168 --> 28:56.778
I'm the man for the job.

28:56.822 --> 28:59.389
Yeah, Garrison, you don't really
get a say in this.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.913
Actually,
I think that I do get a say

29:00.956 --> 29:02.262
when my life is on the line.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.613
My cover isn't blown yet, right?

29:05.656 --> 29:07.789
You give me my phone back, I bet
there's a couple missed calls

29:07.833 --> 29:09.443
from Serano. He expects me.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.401
So I use that, try to set up

29:11.445 --> 29:12.881
a meeting. I tell him
it didn't work out

29:12.925 --> 29:16.450
with <i>Yvette,</i>
<i>and we see what he wants.</i>

29:18.408 --> 29:20.106
I'll wear a wire.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.325
I don't know.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.370
That's taking a hell of a risk.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.414
I know.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.025
And if I do make it,

29:26.068 --> 29:29.245
I will very much enjoy
my anonymous life in Maui.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.160
Thank you for offering.

29:31.204 --> 29:34.033
Look, I'm his right hand.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.338
He talks to me, and the fact is

29:35.382 --> 29:37.210
he loves to talk,
and I can get him

29:37.253 --> 29:38.777
to own up to the Austin job.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.822
And Spider.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.651
Micki, I owe it to Spider.

29:45.348 --> 29:48.177
Why's everybody got to be
a damn maverick on my watch?

30:07.588 --> 30:10.460
Dad didn't pick you up?

30:10.504 --> 30:14.377
Well, my mom took my car.
After everything.

30:15.596 --> 30:18.120
Get in the car, Davidson.

30:39.054 --> 30:42.014
All right, I'll
be right back.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.843
You want me to bring you
back a beer or popcorn

30:44.886 --> 30:46.409
or...?Okay, can you not
undersell this?

30:46.453 --> 30:48.194
Relax. I waited half my life

30:48.237 --> 30:50.718
for you to come back. You
can wait a half an hour for me.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.896
You know what's a great
way to pass the time?

30:54.940 --> 30:56.593
Mm. What?

30:56.637 --> 30:59.118
- A mix CD.
- Oh, my God.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.684
Come on, I'm walking
into the abyss.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.600
You can't even listen to
my last sonic love letter?

31:03.644 --> 31:05.428
Don't pull that.
You did not make this for me.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.517
I made it thinking of you.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.216
Does that count?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.829
Just go. And be safe, okay?

31:14.873 --> 31:18.485
Now she wants me to go.
And she's worried about me.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.925
Hey.

31:23.969 --> 31:27.276
I-I'm sure you got somebody
waiting for you back in Austin.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.017
And I'm happy for you.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.627
And who knows? Maybe...

31:30.671 --> 31:32.238
Maybe I'll finally do
something right with my life.

31:33.500 --> 31:37.417
Or I'm just gonna keep losing
the girl, you know?

31:52.736 --> 31:54.434
Wow.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.413
He was there.

32:26.988 --> 32:30.687
This is Ramirez.
Anyone got eyes on Garrison?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.171
Garrison, you copy?

32:36.215 --> 32:38.695
Garrison, you copy?

32:40.480 --> 32:42.743
Walker, you got a visual?

32:44.919 --> 32:46.529
I do.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.923
He's heading up the stairs
in the back.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.142
All right.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.752
Vehicle parked out front.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.320
It's the same one Serano and
his bodyguards drove earlier.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.365
Garrison, can you hear us?

32:56.409 --> 32:57.976
Garrison, check in.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.804
Micki, give him a sec.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.893
Maybe he went dark for a reason.

33:11.772 --> 33:15.297
Let's go. Let's go.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.442
Garrison.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.879
Thanks for coming.
Glad you could make it.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.446
You see, there's this thing

33:33.489 --> 33:35.752
I wanted to talk to you about.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.326
Wire went dead.
Anybody have eyes

33:44.370 --> 33:46.111
on Garrison?

33:49.897 --> 33:51.594
How'd you know?

33:51.638 --> 33:53.640
Earl and Horace, of course.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.511
Tipped me off

33:55.555 --> 33:58.297
about a certain
Ranger Ramirez.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.168
Or is it Ranger Yvette?

34:00.995 --> 34:03.563
Now, there's only
one way out of this.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.913
Or I'm gonna kill you

34:05.956 --> 34:09.699
and that pretty little lady
of yours, too.

34:12.963 --> 34:16.228
Anybody have eyes on Garrison
or Serano? Anyone?

34:16.271 --> 34:18.404
Moving in for a closer look.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.232
Walker, wait.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.538
This might be a trap. Wait!

34:23.365 --> 34:24.888
What are you talking about?

34:24.932 --> 34:27.021
Garrison was at the bar
the night Spider was killed.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.502
Look, he might've
killed Spider himself.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.112
Or this is all a setup.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.374
I'm going in.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.303
Got a visual on Serano.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.305
I'm gonna take him down.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.307
Walker, you stand down.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.179
You hear me? Stand down.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.484
This is the head of it all.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.573
We're not gonna get
another chance.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.198
Why?

35:13.241 --> 35:16.114
Why did you lie this whole time?

35:21.510 --> 35:23.643
Spider was hired
to kill Stan Morrison

35:23.686 --> 35:26.080
and any other Ranger
who got in the way.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.214
And you were right.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.998
Spider was getting soft.

35:31.999 --> 35:32.913
He got cold feet,

35:32.956 --> 35:34.741
so I took the job for him.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.570
If I didn't,
somebody else would,

35:37.613 --> 35:40.181
and they wouldn't miss.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.357
Did you miss on purpose?

35:42.401 --> 35:44.185
Yeah.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.578
But I can't do that
this time.

35:47.362 --> 35:48.581
Serano said he'd kill you

35:48.624 --> 35:49.756
if I didn't go through
with this.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.932
You're gonna have
to stop me, Micki.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.164
Next shot won't miss!

36:06.207 --> 36:07.339
No!

36:14.650 --> 36:16.478
No. No!

36:16.522 --> 36:17.914
Garrison! Hold on.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.613
No!

36:20.656 --> 36:22.136
No. No, come on.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.358
Serano's on the move.

36:26.401 --> 36:28.186
He's on the move.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.147
No. No.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.281
Out of the car with your hands
behind your head right now.

36:36.324 --> 36:37.804
Let's go. Let's go.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.458
Garrison!

36:39.501 --> 36:41.155
No!

36:41.199 --> 36:42.765
Hold on! Hold on!

36:42.809 --> 36:45.028
I'm losing you. Come on!

36:46.987 --> 36:48.249
Garrison!

36:48.293 --> 36:49.946
- No!
- Micki.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.426
No!

36:51.470 --> 36:54.255
Come on. Come on.
No!

36:54.299 --> 36:55.387
No!

36:55.430 --> 36:57.606
- It's not your fault.
- No.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.187
No!

37:46.742 --> 37:49.136
Hey. Flor.
What?

37:49.702 --> 37:51.617
What do you need?

37:53.967 --> 37:55.882
I need to drive.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.503
- Thanks. I'll
- take him from here.
- Is she gonna be okay?

38:12.681 --> 38:14.988
Uh, yeah.
I'm gonna keep an eye on her.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.250
Yeah.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.860
And what about you?

38:18.644 --> 38:21.211
I mean, w-watching
you walk out of that fire...

38:21.255 --> 38:22.430
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:22.474 --> 38:25.564
Probably not a great memory.
Um...

38:25.607 --> 38:27.000
No.

38:27.043 --> 38:30.569
Maybe something
we should, uh, deal with.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.397
Hey, Cordell.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.964
I'll be seeing you.

38:53.374 --> 38:56.769
Ah, two roads diverged.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.684
Uh, I can walk from here.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.817
- Don't be weird.
- We've been sitting

39:01.861 --> 39:04.820
on our asses all day.
I need to walk.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.475
Wait.

39:14.047 --> 39:16.702
- Is that yours?
- No.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.660
It must be yours.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.923
No, we don't have horses.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.146
Well, what do we do with it?

39:27.756 --> 39:29.889
We help it.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.286
I like this song.

41:04.810 --> 41:05.767
Me, too.
