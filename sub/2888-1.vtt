Tell yöu what?

00:40.374 --> 00:41.717
About last night.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.867
So, I go to that new spot
on, uh, Sixth and Main, right?

00:44.893 --> 00:45.554
Right.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.706
Nice atmosphere,
beautiful women, Danny.

00:47.761 --> 00:48.189
Shit.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.058
Why are yöu saying “shit"?
I asked yöu to come.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.391
I see this chick,
cute girl, tight.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.521
Model tight?

00:53.654 --> 00:54.724
No. No, no, no, no.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.982
I'm not fucking with them
anorexic girls no more, dude.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.901
It's like fucking a 10 speed
bike with daddy issues.

00:58.992 --> 00:59.688
True.

00:59.790 --> 01:02.265
This girl,
she's put together, man,

01:02.396 --> 01:04.501
I mean, nice tities,
nice ass, whole package.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.511
But,
I think I kind of know her.

01:06.617 --> 01:09.400
Hey, my name is Bernie.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.121
Good for yöu.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.542
yöu know Angela.

01:13.668 --> 01:14.748
Yeah, I know Ang, too.

01:14.881 --> 01:16.428
Right, Bernie.

01:16.460 --> 01:17.344
Yeah.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.470
Yeah, yöu used to date Angela.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.181
Date?

01:21.302 --> 01:24.676
No, I was fucking the shit out
of Angela, that's what that was.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.187
yöu got those
edges nappy, huh?

<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font>

01:27.354 --> 01:28.724
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN:</font> So, at this
point, I'm intrigued.

01:28.834 --> 01:33.265
Nothing makes a guy sexier than if
he screwed over a chick yöu hate.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.634
<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font>
It's like revenge by association.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.035
Exactly.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.442
So, this Bernie's got a pair.
It's ladies' night, I'm down, we get drunk.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.527
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu buy?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Of course, I buy. What am I, a dick?

01:42.536 --> 01:45.380
She gets drunk, I get drunk
we go back to my place, right?

01:45.539 --> 01:48.110
Listen to me,
Danny, this chick was insane.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.653
But he gets too drunk.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.780
See, yöu always let
them drink too much.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.119
No. It is not
my fault he got...

01:54.214 --> 01:56.387
Whiskey dick?
Shame on yöu.

01:56.573 --> 01:59.294
Dude, I had to keep up with her
drinking or else I look like a pussy.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.879
It's not my fault my friend
downstairs couldn't keep it together.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.629
yöu got two ways to
look at whiskey dick.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.227
The con is that yöur dick
is functionally dysfunctional.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.136
The pro is that
yöur click gets extra

02:08.261 --> 02:10.070
special attention for
his extra special needs.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.167
How much extra special attention
did she have to give yöu?

02:12.265 --> 02:15.178
It was heaven. She was down
there at least 20 minutes.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.407
Any longer than that
and yöu might as well charge.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.314
So, I'm pulling
out all the stops.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.282
I'm talking dirty,
I do handwork...

02:21.341 --> 02:24.584
I put on a goddamn slow jam.
I mean, I am impressing myself.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.646
Mmm..hmm.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.625
I am like an EMT crew
reviving a car crash victim.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.682
Ha!

02:29.750 --> 02:33.095
Do yöu know what I mean? I'm like
a hairdryer, lam blowing so hard.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.659
But, I must admit,
it was well worth the wait.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.203
Really?
Mmm..hmm.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.363
Impressive,
but not threatening.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.999
It's like the John
Legend of penises.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.098
Mmm. That is impressive.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.134
Very.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.210
So I'm down there
and it is the...

02:50.303 --> 02:53.477
Best head this year.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.814
What?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.515
Thorough, paid attention to detail,
took pride in her work, Danny.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.181
Did she do yöur taxes as well?

02:59.279 --> 03:00.656
Snarky, but I'll allow it.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.193
Only reason why is because
yöu been crying in yöur beer

03:02.282 --> 03:04.319
since crazy Alison left
yöur ass over a year ago.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.385
I'm taking my time.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.826
yöu know what yöur problem is?
yöu're too damn good looking, man.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.888
What?

03:08.955 --> 03:10.798
See, guys like me gotta work a
lot harder than guys like yöu.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.701
Guys like yöu don't appreciate the
wealth of asses at their disposal.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.138
Best thing that could happen to yöur
face is an industrial accident.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.698
Whatever.
I'm serious.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.869
Dude, yöu need to go meet yöu
a nice looking female,

03:19.966 --> 03:21.877
take her back to yöur place,
turn her out!

03:21.968 --> 03:23.003
Make her feel things.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.515
yöu made Joan feel things?

03:24.571 --> 03:27.074
Oh, I made her feel like good
and evil hung in the balance,

03:27.174 --> 03:30.383
like we were at peace talks and her
orgasms were the end of genocide.

03:30.577 --> 03:31.578
I saved the world
last night, Danny.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.658
We appreciate it, brother.
yöu're welcome.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.591
Then she was like...

"Well, bitch, which is it?"

03:51.531 --> 03:53.533
I got a Charley horse.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.738
Ah, were yöur legs
up around yöur...

03:54.835 --> 03:58.282
Obviously, which is so annoying,
because I was just about to...

03:58.371 --> 04:00.214
Come on.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.219
I'm like, finish yöur yoga
so we can do it again.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.686
Right, but
the headline there is "again."

04:03.777 --> 04:05.188
Yes.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.280
We had to start all over.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.757
So if it was bad sex, why are
we hanging out with this guy?

04:08.849 --> 04:12.126
It wasn't bad,
it was imperfect.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.259
Isn't that the same thing?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.026
Heads up,
Little Miss Overachiever.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.398
When it comes to sex,
if yöu get it right

04:17.524 --> 04:19.868

yöu got nowhere to go.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.927

04:22.129 --> 04:23.540
Oh, wait, there he is.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.931
The other one's cute.

That must be his "this
isn't a date" friend.

if it's a bar, that means

04:41.882 --> 04:43.122
we supposed to
be getting drunk.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.376
Ah, easy.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.383
That's because he felt emasculated.
I mean, she left him.

That happens a lot,
don't be embarrassed.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.749

Yes, it is! And yöu know why?

36:38.329 --> 36:39.637
Why?

36:39.731 --> 36:41.005
Because in every
relationship everywhere,

36:41.066 --> 36:44.013
there is a person who cares
more than the other person.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.549
And whoever says
"I love yöu" first...

36:45.637 --> 36:46.980
Cares more!

36:47.172 --> 36:49.652
That other person's gotta
match that level of caring.

36:49.741 --> 36:53.211
Which is impossible because
she will always care more!

36:53.311 --> 36:57.020
Now yöu're saying things like, "I
don't know if I feel the same way."

36:57.082 --> 36:58.220

36:58.316 --> 36:59.716

36:59.718 --> 37:00.992

I'm saying, Ike.
