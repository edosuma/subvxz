00:01.000 --> 00:03.868
Previously on "Alias":

00:06.006 --> 00:09.669
She's not here.
Repeat, Anna is not in the car.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.685
- Get out of my way.
- You can't have it. I won't let you. Stop it.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.482
Move.

00:21.554 --> 00:28.118
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved, but
I was chosen and this is my road to follow.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.185
Welcome back.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.596
(Sydney) Today we shouldn't focus
on what we lost...

00:42.142 --> 00:45.908
but what we gained
by having Nadia in our lives.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.346
I not only gained a sister, but a friend.

00:52.085 --> 00:55.680
When I think of the years
of loneliness she had -

00:56.556 --> 01:00.083
no family to speak of,
not knowing where she truly belonged -

01:01.761 --> 01:07.529
I'm so grateful for the warmth and affection
she was surrounded by in the end.

01:09.202 --> 01:12.763
She taught me the meaning of family.

01:16.209 --> 01:19.269
That it goes deeper than blood.

01:20.146 --> 01:23.138
That it starts with friendship.

01:24.818 --> 01:28.549
And it comforts me to know
that although she was taken far too soon...

01:30.256 --> 01:34.522
what she left me with
will stay with me forever.

01:54.013 --> 01:57.210
How could I have trusted him again?

01:57.283 --> 01:59.274
After everything?

02:00.687 --> 02:02.951
You thought he'd changed.

02:03.022 --> 02:05.513
Nadia didn't.

02:05.592 --> 02:09.527
I convinced her
that he deserved a second chance.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.663
I showed him compassion.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.404
I won't make that mistake again.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.913
- Has he asked for anything?
- No. Just a pitcher of water.

02:43.229 --> 02:47.165
How's it coming? Page 47.
Have you decoded it yet?

02:47.233 --> 02:51.033
As I told you before,
it's going to take time.

02:51.104 --> 02:54.005
More time,
if these interruptions continue.

02:54.073 --> 02:57.236
It's been almost a week already,
Mr. Sloane.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.212
So when do you think
we may see some results?

03:02.282 --> 03:06.582
This isn't a crossword puzzle, Ms. Peyton.
The key to Rambaldi's end game

03:06.653 --> 03:12.489
is encoded within that manuscript where
it has remained hidden for 500 years.

03:12.559 --> 03:15.426
I hardly think that a week is unreasonable.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.357
Perhaps you'd like
to take a walk around the grounds.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.165
Something to clear your mind,
allow you to focus.

03:25.238 --> 03:29.698
I'm sure the armed gentleman outside
the door won't mind if I slip away for lunch.

03:29.776 --> 03:34.645
You're not a prisoner, if that's what you're
asking, but given your fugitive status

03:34.714 --> 03:38.480
you understand our reservations
about letting you walk around in public.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.678
Yes, of course.

03:40.753 --> 03:44.245
I know you've had to make
some tough sacrifices.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.486
We all have.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.496
You think I'm having a crisis of conscience
because I killed Nadia?

03:54.567 --> 03:57.661
Let me be clear.

03:57.737 --> 04:04.233
No one will stand between me and the
fulfillment of Rambaldi's ultimate vision.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.436
No one.

04:07.113 --> 04:13.279
And unless you know someone else who's
familiar with 1 5th-century cryptography,

04:13.353 --> 04:15.787
I'm sure you can wait a few more days.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.449
Of course.

04:22.295 --> 04:27.961
If there's anything we can do to expedite
your work, you'll let me know?

04:34.307 --> 04:38.243
- Have you seen anything like that before?
- It's a solid-state memory chip.

04:38.311 --> 04:43.613
Cutting-edge tech, back in the '70s, which
I'm guessing is when this guy was made.

04:43.683 --> 04:49.121
- What was it doing inside Renee?
- That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?

04:49.822 --> 04:54.919
There's several hundred kilobytes of data
on this thing. Problem is, it's all encoded.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.122
Who'd think 30-year-old encrypted
algorithms would be a problem?

04:58.197 --> 05:01.428
It wouldn't if the code was complete,
but half the data's missing.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.594
Probably corrupted over time.

05:03.670 --> 05:07.231
Without it, I can't create a baseline
for encryption analysis.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.368
- You can't extrapolate the missing data?
- I'm trying to, if I can hold my breath.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.605
What about these markings?
What are these?

05:13.680 --> 05:17.912
Uh, it's probably nothing. You know,
maybe just a serial number, maybe,

05:17.984 --> 05:22.944
or... oh, the name of the company
that desi... Whoa.

05:23.022 --> 05:27.459
- What is it?
- Hold on a sec. I'll put it up on the monitor.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.197
- We should tell Sydney.
- I'll do that. In the meantime...

05:33.266 --> 05:35.359
...do what it takes
to break that encryption.

05:35.435 --> 05:41.840
and I want to know what else is on this
chip. and what it was doing inside Renee.

05:41.908 --> 05:47.710
We just got a hit on one of the hard lines.
Contact Peyton. I'm sending it over now.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.879
- (Isabelle cries)
- Shh, shh, shh.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.885
Isabelle.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.287
Will you please sleep? Sleep.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.890
(doorbell)

06:04.964 --> 06:07.057
(sighs)

06:07.133 --> 06:09.397
Come on, come on.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.707
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart. Isn't this her nap time?

06:15.775 --> 06:19.836
Oh, I wish. Apparently this little girl
doesn't need sleep anymore.

06:19.912 --> 06:23.905
- We got a collective four hours last night.
- Must be genetic.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.816
You used to wake up at 4am every day,
like clockwork.

06:26.886 --> 06:31.346
I'm sorry about that. Did Marshall
finish his analysis of the chip?

06:31.424 --> 06:35.155
That's why I'm here. Marshall
found data on it, all of it encrypted.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.527
He also found something else.

06:38.598 --> 06:42.694
Vaughn's name was etched on the outside
of the device.

06:42.769 --> 06:46.466
- His real name, Andre Michaux.
- Wait. What?

06:46.539 --> 06:50.168
Marshall believes the chip was placed
inside Renee almost 30 years ago.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.939
Vaughn and Renee didn't
know each other 30 years ago.

06:53.012 --> 06:56.778
Their fathers did. Vaughn told you they
worked together against Prophet Five.

06:56.849 --> 07:00.580
And you're thinking what? That one of
them implanted the chip inside Renee?

07:00.653 --> 07:04.350
At this point
it's the most likely presumption.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.915
- Why? Why would they...?
- I don't know.

07:06.993 --> 07:11.396
But someone left Vaughn's name on it
intentionally, expecting it to be found.

07:11.464 --> 07:16.231
It's possible he may have some
understanding of what the chip contains.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.099
Dad. No.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.298
As far as Prophet Five is concerned,
Vaughn is dead. Involving him...

07:22.375 --> 07:24.570
Acalculated risk,! know.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.908
He's still in recovery.
He is not field ready.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.311
I know.
I'll do everything I can to protect him.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.613
We'll have an agent dead drop the chip.
He'll never be seen.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.243
- Dad...
- Sydney,

07:34.320 --> 07:38.154
we don't have a choice. Sloane's decision
to openly join Prophet Five

07:38.224 --> 07:41.250
suggests that they're close
to their end game.

07:41.327 --> 07:44.455
Right now, this chip is our only lead.

07:46.165 --> 07:47.894
OK.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.698
But if someone's gonna take that chip
to Vaughn, it's me.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.875
(Dixon) Syd's en route to Nepal to see
someone who can decipher the chip.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.776
- (Tom) Who's the contact?
- Someone who worked with Renee.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.711
That's all Jack told me.

08:01.781 --> 08:07.447
This contact Sydney's meeting in Nepal.
Do you have any idea who it is?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.886
No, I don't know of any assets in Nepal.

08:11.958 --> 08:17.123
I assume this means that you're going to
take action on this. You sure that's wise?

08:17.196 --> 08:19.687
APO will want to know
how you obtained the intel,

08:19.765 --> 08:23.963
which could prompt them
to looking into the security leak.

08:24.036 --> 08:28.473
Whatever's on that chip,
I certainly hope it's worth the risk.

08:29.141 --> 08:33.601
Thanks for the counsel. We're sending
an agent to intercept the device.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.648
We'd like you to brief her
before she leaves.

08:36.716 --> 08:41.517
Fine, although I'm not sure
what further assistance I can provide.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.746
Oh, I think you'd be surprised.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.090
Send her in, please.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.533
You remember Anna Espinosa.

09:59.198 --> 10:01.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.895
- You busy?
- Just trying to catch up on the latest tech.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.768
What's going on?

10:08.074 --> 10:11.601
When's the last time you went to a movie?

10:11.677 --> 10:14.544
The last movie. Uh...

10:14.614 --> 10:19.517
I used to go to movies all the time,
and I haven't been in so long because

10:19.585 --> 10:23.112
there's always something
more important to do.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.647
This isn't about going to the movies, is it?

10:26.726 --> 10:31.095
When you were working at the Shed,
did you ever see an agent buried?

10:33.299 --> 10:34.823
No.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.097
- It takes a while to get over it.
- What if I can't?

10:38.170 --> 10:40.400
What if I'm not cut out for this?

10:41.407 --> 10:44.672
First it was Gordon Dean,
and now it's Sloane.

10:44.744 --> 10:50.046
They were right in front of me the whole
time deceiving me and I was oblivious.

10:50.116 --> 10:53.085
You're a good agent, Rachel.

10:54.387 --> 10:58.790
Listen. I would tell you
if I didn't think you could handle this.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.391
Thanks.

11:19.945 --> 11:24.814
Hello? I'd like to place a classified ad
in next week's edition.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.414
(Anna) A child?

11:31.490 --> 11:33.981
Yes, that's right.
Sydney has a daughter.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.360
What's her name?

11:37.430 --> 11:39.261
Isabelle.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.232
I suppose Vaughn is the father.
Or was the father, I should say.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.506
Yes, that's right.

11:48.574 --> 11:53.034
In this business,
it's always the children who suffer.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.540
Hm.

11:56.615 --> 12:00.142
Arvin, ittroublesyou, doesn'tit?

12:00.219 --> 12:04.246
Looking at me,
seeing her look back at you.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.216
You're nothing like her.

12:07.293 --> 12:10.785
- I suppose you know what I'm like?
- Of course I do.

12:10.863 --> 12:14.094
You're driven by anger.
You crave power,

12:14.166 --> 12:17.567
which I assume is something
you were deprived of in childhood.

12:17.636 --> 12:22.869
Sydney, on the other hand, is driven by a
sense of duty, of loyalty, to those she loves.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.342
That's where she gets her strength.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.375
It's also what makes her weak.

12:29.448 --> 12:33.384
Attachments are a vulnerability,
which are easily exploited.

12:33.452 --> 12:37.616
And yet, she somehow always manages
to best you.

12:37.690 --> 12:41.217
And now a victory
she's not even aware of.

12:41.293 --> 12:46.629
Tell me... I imagine you do your best
to avoid mirrors, yes?

12:46.699 --> 12:53.104
And I suppose you believe you're driven
by faith? Look where it's gotten you.

12:53.172 --> 12:57.233
Something tells me being Prophet Five's
newest pawn wasn't your end game.

12:57.309 --> 13:02.906
Well, unlike yourself,
I know my place in the big picture.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.109
You will continue to deceive yourself

13:05.184 --> 13:08.051
if you think you're anything
more than dispensable.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.318
This... procedure that you've undergone.

13:13.225 --> 13:16.217
There must be a reason
why they want you to look like Sydney,

13:16.295 --> 13:18.957
and when that purpose is fulfilled...

13:19.365 --> 13:21.595
you will become unnecessary.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.296
Lovely catching up.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.945
The truth is,
you're no different than she is.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.817
You're dispensable too.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.578
Miss Bristow?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.356
I'm Nabin.

14:22.027 --> 14:26.396
- I'm afraid you must have overlooked me.
- Yes, I did.

14:26.899 --> 14:30.062
It's no matter.
You yourself are hard to overlook.

14:30.135 --> 14:33.969
In fact, you're just as lovely
as Mr. Vaughn described.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.339
Mr. Vaughn.

14:38.410 --> 14:42.312
Don't tell him I told you.
He talks about you all the time.

14:42.381 --> 14:48.013
Come. My car is just this way.
The drive is only 20 minutes.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.523
- How is Mr. Vaughn?
- He's recovering very well.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.923
Nicely healed, I should think.
Here we are.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.223
Can I help you with your bag?

15:03.669 --> 15:06.797
Hurry, we don't have much time.

15:06.872 --> 15:11.070
His name's Nabin. Michael Vaughn sent
him to pick up Agent Bristow.

15:11.143 --> 15:13.805
- Vaughn? Isn't he...?
- Apparently not.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.440
- OK. I'll see you at the intercept point.
- Wait.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.441
Wear this.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.057
- Nabin?
- Miss Bristow.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.325
- Welcome to Nepal.
- Thank you.

15:33.399 --> 15:37.631
Right this way.
Mr Vaughn is so eager to see you.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.263
- No, this is not good.
- (woman) Sorry. sir.

15:40.339 --> 15:43.240
When will you have the one
with the comfort grip in stock?

15:43.309 --> 15:45.402
- I'll transfer you to Customer Service.
- No!

15:45.477 --> 15:48.913
- Ask for the manager. (line crackles)
- Could you repeat that?

15:48.981 --> 15:51.848
- Can you hear me?
- No, I can... There's a clicking sound.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.818
- Do you hear that?
- No. but I'll have the manager call you...

15:54.887 --> 15:58.448
- All right, why don't you have him call me?
- All right.

15:58.524 --> 16:02.085
- Thank you for nothing. Bye.
- Thank you for calling.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.027
(sighs)

16:13.272 --> 16:14.637
- Marshall?
- Um...

16:14.707 --> 16:17.107
- We're out of coffee.
- Coffee?

16:17.176 --> 16:20.441
Yeah. Uh, I know you might not
think that's important,

16:20.512 --> 16:23.504
that a lot of people
who don't drink coffee generally

16:23.582 --> 16:26.745
might say that you should have some tea
or some soda,

16:26.819 --> 16:32.451
which also has, um, caffeine but I'm telling
you it's not the same. It's important.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.891
- You're sure?
- Positive. I noticed a glitch on the phone

16:38.964 --> 16:43.958
so I checked the PBX controls. According
to records, Sloane logged onto the network

16:44.036 --> 16:48.200
and put the entire phone system
on some sort of passive surveillance mode

16:48.273 --> 16:51.902
- which I didn't even know was possible.
- How did he get access?

16:51.977 --> 16:54.468
His authorization codes
were revoked four days ago.

16:54.546 --> 16:58.676
I was thinking the same thing,
but Sloane installed most of the systems.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.982
He must have installed
some sort of back door in the network.

17:02.054 --> 17:06.150
Listen, for the past 24 hours, Sloane and
most likely Prophet Five have been able

17:06.224 --> 17:09.558
to monitor every conversation inside APO.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.025
We need to contact Sydney immediately.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.857
(phone rings)

17:17.636 --> 17:20.002
- Hello?
- Sydney, listen to me very carefully.

17:20.071 --> 17:23.530
- Are you with your contact?
- Yeah, I am.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.669
There's been a security breach at APO.
It was Sloane.

17:26.744 --> 17:30.545
We have reason to believe
you've been compromised.

17:31.216 --> 17:36.017
No, we're right on time, actually.
I'll call you once we arrive.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.360
Cellphones, they are a miracle.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.731
Don't slow down, just go around.

17:50.803 --> 17:55.740
You're in a hurry, I understand,
but perhaps shouldn't we stop for him?

18:37.182 --> 18:39.810
- Hello, Sydney.
- (groans)

18:59.037 --> 19:01.130
Well, that was fairly easy.

19:01.206 --> 19:05.040
Of course, if I'd known it was in Renee
I would have saved us both the trouble

19:05.110 --> 19:08.136
and cut it out of her myself
when I slit her throat.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.078
Wait.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.049
Anna.

19:12.117 --> 19:16.520
Sorry, Syd, don't have time to chat.
I've got a date.

19:17.422 --> 19:22.826
Now, I don't know exactly
what I'm gonna do with your boyfriend.

19:22.895 --> 19:26.387
But whatever it is... I'll have fun doing it.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.863
Hey.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.293
Hi.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.768
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

20:47.546 --> 20:50.606
Actually, the doctor says
I don't need this anymore.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.980
I think it looks debonair.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.042
It does.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.716
God, I missed you.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.465
How is she?

21:15.540 --> 21:16.632
Isabelle.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.102
She's beautiful.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.645
Just like her mother.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.617
Isabelle. Isabelle.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.247
You named her lsabelle.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.883
- You like it?
- Yeah.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.918
It was my idea, wasn't it?
What is it you wanted? Clementine?

21:41.633 --> 21:46.832
Not a day's gone by
that I didn't want to call you, talk to you.

21:48.907 --> 21:52.365
I had this fear I'd never see you again.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.004
Silly, huh?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.241
Maybe a little.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.713
(coughs)

22:06.191 --> 22:09.957
I'm assuming this is good news.
Have you made any progress?

22:10.028 --> 22:14.727
No. Unfortunately I've discovered
an anomaly in the composition.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.395
Joseph Pinara's influence
in Rambaldi's encryption.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.535
Pinara was a 1 4th-century cleric who...

22:21.606 --> 22:24.632
I'll skip the history lesson if you don't mind.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.609
Le Librairie.

22:27.679 --> 22:31.115
It's a private seller
of used books in Geneva.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.448
They have a copy
of the Pinara manuscript.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.317
I can't decipher page 47 without it.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.557
Fine. Write down the address.
I'll get it myself.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.990
Very well.

22:55.941 --> 22:59.035
(Nadia) How long do you think
you can deceive them?

23:00.045 --> 23:02.036
Page 47?

23:03.548 --> 23:07.484
Eventually they're gonna find out
you already know what it says.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.917
Hm.

23:08.987 --> 23:12.445
You're stalling.
You must have some plan.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.757
What do you want from me, Nadia?

23:16.828 --> 23:18.853
I don't want anything.

23:19.831 --> 23:22.527
Why don't you understand, Nadia?

23:25.771 --> 23:30.105
Every sacrifice I've ever made
has been for the greater good.

23:30.175 --> 23:35.374
Yet every sacrifice you've made
has come at someone else's expense.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.508
Or have you forgotten?

23:40.352 --> 23:42.582
Oh, no, I haven't forgotten.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.952
I play it over in my mind.

23:45.957 --> 23:50.894
The irony, all those years I was worried
about your well-being,

23:50.962 --> 23:53.692
and now I realize, in the end...

23:54.699 --> 23:56.963
I had no choice.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.430
You still believe that, don't you?

24:00.505 --> 24:05.442
That your actions are controlled by fate?
That you were chosen?

24:07.012 --> 24:08.707
Why, Dad?

24:08.780 --> 24:13.717
Surely you must ask yourself,
"Why would Rambaldi choose you?"

24:13.785 --> 24:18.188
You're not a man of honor.
You're not particularly courageous.

24:18.256 --> 24:23.159
You're charitable, but only when it serves
your own interest, and last but not least,

24:23.228 --> 24:26.197
you murder the people you claim to love.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.631
- What do you want from me, Nadia?
- I don't want anything.

24:29.701 --> 24:31.896
Then why are you here?

24:31.970 --> 24:33.801
Dad.

24:35.106 --> 24:37.199
I'm here because you want me here.

24:39.411 --> 24:43.370
Now you can pursue Rambaldi
and have your daughter at the same time.

24:43.448 --> 24:48.181
Isn't that what you said you wanted?
Just before you killed me?

24:49.187 --> 24:51.018
No.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.785
Not like this.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.226
Sir?

24:57.295 --> 25:00.230
Do you need anything?

25:00.599 --> 25:02.965
I thought I heard you talking.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.898
No. I'm fine.

25:10.075 --> 25:13.533
I can't believe Renee's dead.
If it hadn't been for her

25:13.612 --> 25:18.914
I'd have never known about Prophet Five
or the truth of my father. None of it.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.347
Who killed her?

25:24.556 --> 25:27.821
- Anna Espinosa.
- Anna? She was in jail.

25:27.893 --> 25:32.023
Apparently Prophet Five
arranged for her release.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.725
- What do you think it is?
- (sighs)

25:37.802 --> 25:41.033
I don't know.
Renee never mentioned it.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.370
Marshall couldn't decode it?

25:43.441 --> 25:48.469
He thought part of the code might be
missing. Most of the data's been corrupted.

25:48.547 --> 25:54.452
He thinks it was inside Renee's body
since she was a kid, maybe 30 years.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.919
What is it?

25:56.988 --> 25:59.548
Where was it, exactly?

25:59.624 --> 26:03.253
- What do you mean?
- lnside Renee's body, where was it?

26:03.762 --> 26:05.923
I don't know. Why?

26:08.199 --> 26:11.191
My father told me that I had
a bike accident when I was a kid.

26:11.269 --> 26:15.103
Drove it right into a tree. And even though
I have no recollection of it,

26:15.173 --> 26:19.837
I never questioned him,
because it left me with this scar.

26:22.914 --> 26:28.318
Maybe the code isn't corrupted at all.
Maybe there's another half.

26:34.960 --> 26:39.124
OK, this might prevent infection,
but it won't help with pain.

26:40.932 --> 26:45.426
No, but if you can handle childbirth,
I can handle this.

26:47.706 --> 26:50.402
I'm in good hands.

26:51.476 --> 26:54.036
You need to sit very still.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.047
- This is gonna hurt.
- Yeah, I know, you mentioned that.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.447
It's OK. I trust you.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.256
(phone rings)

27:14.332 --> 27:17.199
- Hello?
- (Sydney) Dad. it's me.

27:17.268 --> 27:19.463
- Sydney, are you OK?
- You were right.

27:19.537 --> 27:22.904
The mission's been compromised.
Anna knows about Vaughn.

27:22.974 --> 27:27.172
- Where are you?
- Wait, Dad, listen to me. It gets worse.

27:27.712 --> 27:29.703
I've been doubled.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.915
- You need to stay still.
- (groans)

27:34.986 --> 27:38.285
- Think about something else.
- Give me something to think about.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.517
Tell me about lsabelle.

27:41.526 --> 27:43.960
Well, she... has your eyes.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.224
The same... blue-green,

27:46.297 --> 27:49.266
- and... her smile is...
- (groans)

27:49.334 --> 27:51.825
- is like your smile.
- Really?

27:51.903 --> 27:55.339
Yeah. But her chin is pointy.
It's like mine. It's cute.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.568
Oh, God, I can't wait to meet her.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.144
- (groans)
- Ah!

28:00.211 --> 28:01.508
Got it.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.983
Apply pressure.

28:09.788 --> 28:12.586
- Same etchings.
- Renee Goursaud.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.353
Yeah. Can I see that?

28:23.935 --> 28:27.063
Perfect fit.

28:41.553 --> 28:46.013
I'm looking for a manuscript
by Joseph Pinara. I called ahead.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.652
Wait one moment.
I've got it right over here.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.730
Your receipt is in the book.
Nothing else?

28:57.802 --> 29:00.703
No. That'll be all.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.637
Thanks.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.517
I believe there is someone
trying to contact you.

29:15.587 --> 29:20.786
No. It wasn't him.
It was a woman, but she knew the protocol.

29:28.633 --> 29:31.261
- German.
- Yeah.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.701
Looks like some sort of emergency
evacuation plan,

29:35.774 --> 29:39.972
continuity of government
from the Cold War.

29:40.044 --> 29:42.035
It's a nuclear fallout bunker.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.082
Hamburg, Germany, under Bergner Park.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.516
You think there's something there?

29:47.585 --> 29:51.248
- Maybe. I'm gonna go with you to find out.
- Oh...

29:51.656 --> 29:54.989
I know you think I'm not ready,
but you said it, my father left this map.

29:55.059 --> 29:59.257
Chances are when you get there
you may need my help.

29:59.330 --> 30:02.527
You're right.
I'll call for transport.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.431
OK.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.716
No!

30:34.833 --> 30:38.064
What I'm about to tell you
is not to leave this room.

30:38.136 --> 30:41.071
AgentVaughn isalive.

30:41.139 --> 30:44.575
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew he couldn't be dead.

30:45.376 --> 30:50.370
The last few months he's been in a secure
location in Nepal pending his recovery.

30:50.448 --> 30:54.942
I hope you all understand that secrecy was
a necessary measure to ensure his safety.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.544
Unfortunately,
those measures weren't sufficient.

30:57.622 --> 31:01.319
Through Sloane's tapping, Prophet Five
learned of Sydney's trip to Nepal.

31:01.392 --> 31:04.225
- They sent an agent to intercept her.
- Is she OK?

31:04.295 --> 31:08.391
She's fine. She made it to Vaughn's
location but Vaughn was no longer there.

31:08.466 --> 31:12.061
- He was abducted?
- In a manner of speaking.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.366
We managed to pick up the trail.

31:16.441 --> 31:20.775
This was taken in Hamburg lnternational
Airport one hour ago.

31:20.845 --> 31:23.405
The woman in the photo is not Sydney.

31:36.127 --> 31:39.290
You sure you got the coordinates right?

31:40.265 --> 31:44.702
- What happened to Bergner Park?
- A lot changes in 30 years.

31:44.769 --> 31:48.364
But those bunkers are steel-reinforced
concrete - tough to demolish.

31:48.439 --> 31:52.375
My guess is that they're still under there.
We just have to find a way in.

31:52.443 --> 31:55.606
You know,
that diamond store over there

31:55.680 --> 31:58.672
probably has
some pretty expensive pieces.

31:58.750 --> 32:03.210
- Chances are they're locked away.
- In some sort of basement storage room.

32:03.288 --> 32:05.381
Worth a try.

32:06.658 --> 32:11.186
- How do you wanna handle this?
- Like we did in Cartagena?

32:11.262 --> 32:14.163
I'll follow your lead.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.669
OK, let's go.

32:30.715 --> 32:34.207
Do you really think you can get away
with this? You're out of your league.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.345
They killed Vaughn and Renee,
and probably Sydney by now.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.720
Stop, Nadia. Just stop.

32:42.260 --> 32:47.630
They're better than you. Smarter. What
makes you think you stand a chance?

32:47.699 --> 32:50.634
This should solve all your problems.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.830
The Pinara manuscript. I hope it helps.

33:03.448 --> 33:08.442
Well. With all the work that has to be done,
I'll get out of your way.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.924
Unfortunately,
I seem to be getting in my own way.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.084
How is that?

33:17.161 --> 33:21.393
The effects of losing a child
cannot be underestimated.

33:21.466 --> 33:24.401
You're right. I am distracted.

33:24.469 --> 33:30.465
In order for me to concentrate on the future,
I need to make peace with the past.

33:35.313 --> 33:36.610
Mm.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.081
Oh, baby, look at this one. Oh!

33:40.885 --> 33:43.513
- Really?
- Oh, it's gorgeous.

33:43.588 --> 33:47.524
- I prefer that one there. It's less... big.
- No, no. No, no.

33:47.592 --> 33:51.790
- Is there anything you would like to see?
- Hi, is this a princess cut?

33:51.863 --> 33:53.660
Yes, it is.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.430
Your girlfriend has very good taste.

33:57.502 --> 33:59.629
For that price
she might as well be a princess.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.673
Costs nothing to try on.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.475
(gasps)

34:09.246 --> 34:12.216
A stone of that quality
has this effect on some people.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.184
No, she has seizures.
Kelly, just breathe. It's OK.

34:15.253 --> 34:19.121
Can I get some help here, please?
It's OK, just relax.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.951
- How do I get access downstairs?
- Uh... uh....

34:25.029 --> 34:27.020
My keys, take my keys.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.924
Watch him.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.753
I'm in Hamburg. Trommelstrabe 1 23.
I'll need an extraction.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.346
Don't hurt me, please.
I'll do whatever you ask.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.288
Then shut up.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.835
- (gun clicks)
- Thanks. I've got it from here.

36:20.711 --> 36:23.043
Who are you?

36:23.114 --> 36:25.378
It's a pity you'll never know.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.024
Sydney and I never went to Cartagena.

36:40.064 --> 36:43.659
And just for the record,
you're a terrible kisser.

36:52.009 --> 36:54.944
I always said Sydney was too good for you.

37:18.769 --> 37:21.966
Let's see if this one's loaded.

37:30.114 --> 37:31.945
Sydney.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.412
- Sydney.
- Vaughn.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.994
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. How did you...?

38:23.234 --> 38:24.565
OK.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.796
We can go now.

39:07.044 --> 39:11.504
Project summaries, test subjects,
names, dates, it's all here.

39:11.582 --> 39:16.952
- Your father's research of Prophet Five.
- Most of these organizations still exist.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.751
- We could end it all.
- (phone rings)

39:30.301 --> 39:34.294
- Go ahead.
- I got your message. Did you get the chip?

39:34.372 --> 39:39.036
- Yes. I'm done here.
- Good. Trommelstrabe.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.045
We should be there in five minutes.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.082
That was Peyton.
She's coming to extract Anna.

39:45.149 --> 39:47.617
Who's Peyton?

39:49.487 --> 39:52.854
Sloane is part of this.
He works with Prophet Five.

39:53.858 --> 39:56.190
He killed Nadia.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.888
- This is my chance to stop him.
- Syd...

39:59.797 --> 40:01.788
I know.

40:03.834 --> 40:10.000
You can't go back to APO. There are moles
in the government, we can't trust anyone.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.475
Contact my father. Explain the situation.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.569
OK, I will.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.707
Here, take this.

40:18.783 --> 40:22.947
It's useless to them without the other half.
Take the tracking device in your phone.

40:23.020 --> 40:27.616
Embed it in the chip. Before you
hand it over we'll be able to track you.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.591
I have to go.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.457
Yeah.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.593
Be careful.

41:02.693 --> 41:05.093
We were expecting
to hear from you sooner.

41:05.162 --> 41:08.131
I ran into a few complications.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.633
Nothing I couldn't handle.

41:12.169 --> 41:14.399
And Sydney?

41:15.272 --> 41:17.570
She's dead.

41:19.944 --> 41:23.175
This is what they found
inside Renee Rienne.

41:27.318 --> 41:32.278
Nice work. Well, if you were able
to pull this off the rest should be easy.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.388
Yeah.
