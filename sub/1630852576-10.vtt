Wyatt:
<i> Previously on "secrets</i>
<i> of sulphur springs"...</i>

00:02.436 --> 00:04.586
Savannah!
Hold on, we're coming!

00:04.689 --> 00:06.855
Griffin, we have to go.
The hatch is stuck.

00:06.941 --> 00:09.257
I realize it was wrong
not talking about your dad.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.477
-Harper:<i> How did you meet?</i>
-Jess:<i> At camp tremont.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.529
<i> He stuck his hand out,</i>
<i> and he said,</i>

00:13.614 --> 00:15.147
<i> "hi, I'm chris."</i>

00:15.232 --> 00:16.348
ben:
<i> We camped out.</i>

00:17.034 --> 00:19.485
But after I fell asleep,
savannah snuck out.

00:19.570 --> 00:20.736
<i> So I did too.</i>

00:21.739 --> 00:23.739
<i> We heard a noise.</i>
<i> I took off.</i>

00:25.659 --> 00:27.743
<i> And I didn't know</i>
<i> till the next morning.</i>

00:28.746 --> 00:29.912
Harper:
Griffin, look.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.880
Griffin:
Is that savannah?

00:31.966 --> 00:33.382
In 1962.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.967
<i> We have to go back. Now.</i>

00:35.052 --> 00:37.503
-Harper, my family is moving.
-What?

00:37.588 --> 00:39.922
-If we could just
find savannah--
-you could stay.

00:40.057 --> 00:42.174
But the portal
only takes us back
30 years at a time.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.726
Maybe there's a way
to control it.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.260
Let's find out.

00:47.932 --> 00:49.014
Bingo.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.099
Griffin:
Dial it to the same numbers

00:50.234 --> 00:51.183
from the one upstairs.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.103
It's savannah.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.437
And she's trying
to help us find her.

01:05.116 --> 01:06.415
So...

01:07.251 --> 01:08.367
What do we do now?

01:08.452 --> 01:09.368
Guess we're supposed
to push it.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.452
Griffin:
W-w-wait!

01:10.588 --> 01:11.954
How do we know
it's not gonna like...

01:12.757 --> 01:14.123
Melt off our faces
or something?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.592
Because savannah
is the one guiding us.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.594
She wants us to save her,
not melt our faces.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.295
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.050
Whoa.

01:25.119 --> 01:28.587
Harper:
Looks like some kind of
weird combination lock.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.939
1-9-9-0.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.941
Wait. I've got it.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.111
They're roman numerals.
1990.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.529
We've only been able
to travel back

01:37.648 --> 01:39.281
30 years from where
we are now, right?

01:39.366 --> 01:41.650
-Right.
-So...

01:42.536 --> 01:44.787
Maybe this little dial
gives us control,

01:44.872 --> 01:46.121
so we can
choose any year.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.373
Okay, uh, try 1962.

01:48.492 --> 01:49.958
That picture
I found of savannah?

01:50.044 --> 01:51.160
That's the year it was taken.

01:52.129 --> 01:53.862
Must be where
she wants us to go.

01:53.964 --> 01:57.466
Six and two.

01:57.968 --> 01:59.668
That's 1962.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.754
Nothing.

02:03.507 --> 02:04.423
It's too bad.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.508
It's a pretty good theory.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.479
Whirring, electricity crackling)

02:12.766 --> 02:16.018
wow. Never underestimate
the power of the locker ninja.

02:16.854 --> 02:17.986
Ready for one last trip?

02:18.072 --> 02:19.521
I mean, before you have
to go back to chicago.

02:21.525 --> 02:22.524
Let's do this.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.944

02:29.517 --> 02:32.451

02:32.536 --> 02:35.204
♪♪

02:57.111 --> 03:00.062
dad, if you just want me to say
it was a mistake coming here...

03:00.731 --> 03:02.364
Fine, it was a mistake.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.033
(sighs)

03:06.203 --> 03:07.536
we're still talking to movers,

03:07.621 --> 03:10.122
but we should be in chicago
by the end of the week.

03:10.241 --> 03:12.708
I can start back at the firm
on Monday if you like.

03:14.245 --> 03:15.744
Yeah, it's what I want.

03:18.716 --> 03:20.916
Because it's the best thing
for my family

03:21.051 --> 03:22.000
and for me.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.419
You were right, dad.

03:25.756 --> 03:27.139
You always are.

03:27.258 --> 03:29.224
♪

03:40.738 --> 03:42.070
guess those old pictures

03:42.189 --> 03:43.572
are going back
to the garage, huh?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.640
Well, they don't have to.

03:45.743 --> 03:47.776
We can look at them together
if you like.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.245
-Really?
-(sighs)

03:50.331 --> 03:52.364
'cause I did have
a couple of questions.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.116
Well, fire away.

03:54.785 --> 03:56.868
I was wondering about...

03:57.588 --> 03:58.620
This one.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.455
Jess:
Oh, yeah.

04:00.591 --> 04:01.873
I remember that day.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.126
That's dad's gto,
right?

04:04.261 --> 04:06.929
Yeah, and before you
and your sister were born,

04:07.047 --> 04:09.464
that yellow car
was his baby.
(chuckles)

04:10.301 --> 04:11.600
he was planning
to sell it though.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.968
Never told me why.

04:13.771 --> 04:16.638
So... That's what
he was driving when...

04:17.775 --> 04:19.274
It's okay.

04:20.144 --> 04:21.560
We can talk about it.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.165
Harper said dad used to go
for rides around the tremont.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.986
But that morning...
He got into an accident.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.323
Right.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.126
Listen... Toph...

04:38.245 --> 04:39.378
Mom...

04:39.463 --> 04:40.746
It's okay.

04:41.799 --> 04:43.332
It's hard for me too.

04:44.335 --> 04:46.168
But I understand
what you meant.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.922
Bad things do happen
at that place.

04:56.313 --> 04:58.630
(indistinct chatter)

05:01.518 --> 05:02.434
wow.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.686
So this is 1962.

05:05.356 --> 05:06.905
Check out
all the old cars.

05:07.024 --> 05:09.358
Harper:
Yeah, and those hairstyles
are pretty cool.

05:09.493 --> 05:10.776
Griffin:
And the clothes.

05:10.861 --> 05:12.277
Hope we don't
stick out too much.

05:13.030 --> 05:14.029
Yeah, me too.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.534
(indistinct chatter)

05:20.671 --> 05:22.421
this place
is pretty busy.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.289
You really think
savannah's around here
somewhere?

05:24.375 --> 05:25.374
I don't know.

05:25.509 --> 05:26.958
Maybe we should
ask someone.

05:28.012 --> 05:29.027
Can I help you kids?

05:29.163 --> 05:30.429
Um, yeah, actually,

05:30.497 --> 05:31.763
we're looking
for a friend of ours.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.332
Is your friend
a guest of the hotel?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.801
I... Don't know.

05:35.886 --> 05:37.169
Maybe.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.304
Man:
I told you.
Take care of it, greg.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.973
I'm sorry,
but you should leave.

05:43.394 --> 05:44.976
-What? Why?
-Come on.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.695
No. Savannah
could be in there.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.031
Sir, you don't understand.
This is really important.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.365
(softly):
Now, griffin.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.317
-You're actually saying
we can't go inside?
-No.

05:53.203 --> 05:54.369
I'm saying she can't.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.238
What? Why?
What did she do?

05:56.373 --> 05:57.656
It's not something
I did, okay?

05:57.741 --> 05:58.790
It's the color of my skin.

05:58.909 --> 05:59.875
Now, let's go.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.577
Oh, no.

06:03.414 --> 06:05.630
No way.
You can't be doing this.

06:05.749 --> 06:07.165
She's my best friend.

06:07.251 --> 06:09.251
Good for you, kid.
Now, please...

06:10.087 --> 06:11.002
Go.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.892
That's just crazy.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.727
-I mean, can you believe it?
-Yes!

06:18.812 --> 06:20.228
I can believe it, griffin.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.430
Look around you.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.764
Look at the year.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.267
This is what it was like,

06:25.402 --> 06:26.485
and not even
that long ago.

06:26.570 --> 06:28.570
I just don't see
how you can be
so calm about it.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.989
(scoffs) trust me,
I'm anything but calm.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.442
It's just not something
you can understand.

06:34.111 --> 06:36.778
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. It's just...

06:38.615 --> 06:40.615
-Do you want to go home?
-As soon as possible.

06:40.751 --> 06:42.868
-But not until we find savannah.
-Harry? Hermione?

06:42.953 --> 06:44.119
-Oh, my gosh!
-Harper: Savannah!

06:44.254 --> 06:45.454
What are you guys
doing back?

06:45.589 --> 06:47.122
You're here!
How did you find me?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.656
Trust me,
it wasn't easy.

06:48.759 --> 06:50.675
We really don't have time
to explain.

06:50.761 --> 06:52.043
We have
a huge favor to ask.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.211
Woman:
Savannah, honey.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.264
Did you remember
to bring those towels
down to the springs?

06:57.017 --> 06:58.216
Yep, I just did,

06:58.302 --> 06:59.667
but we're gonna
need some more.

07:00.771 --> 07:03.805
By the way,
these are my friends,
harry and hermione, from...

07:04.441 --> 07:05.774
My old summer camp.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.392
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you both.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.228
Hey, is it okay
if I knock off a little early?

07:10.314 --> 07:12.180
I wanted to show them
the tree house.

07:12.282 --> 07:14.483
Okay. Just don't be
gone too long.

07:15.152 --> 07:16.034
Thanks, mom.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.486
Follow me.

07:18.288 --> 07:19.955
(whispers):
Mom?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.877
And you're sure
that spot was here?

07:25.963 --> 07:27.329
Of course I'm sure.

07:27.464 --> 07:29.498
We made this map
together, remember?

07:30.801 --> 07:32.300
This is crazy.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.302
Twelve cold spots and now...

07:34.805 --> 07:37.305
(exhales)

07:38.392 --> 07:40.258
nope. No frost.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.764
You don't think
savannah's hiding from us,
do you?

07:46.984 --> 07:48.934
I don't know. Maybe.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.654
-Or what if...
-What?

07:52.739 --> 07:53.822
What if she
stopped haunting us

07:53.907 --> 07:55.723
because she finally got
what she wanted?

07:55.826 --> 07:57.159
What do you mean?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.995
Well, we are
moving back to chicago.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.864
Maybe she's just happy
to have this place
to herself again.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.865
Wow.

08:04.868 --> 08:05.733
I hope that's not it.

08:05.836 --> 08:08.086
How could savannah
not like us?

08:08.205 --> 08:09.704
We're her biggest fans.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.792
So after the tree
fell on the hatch in 1960,

08:13.877 --> 08:15.844
I ran back to the tremont
to ride out the storm.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.846
Next morning,
I went outside,

08:17.931 --> 08:19.014
and the first person I saw

08:19.099 --> 08:20.882
was this really cool lady
named caroline.

08:21.018 --> 08:22.684
That woman that we met?

08:22.769 --> 08:24.970
Your mom?
She seems really nice.

08:25.055 --> 08:26.388
She's the best.

08:26.523 --> 08:28.306
She's literally
the sweetest person ever.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.758
And when she
and her husband, ray,

08:30.861 --> 08:31.943
my dad,

08:32.062 --> 08:33.595
found out
I was a foster kid,

08:33.697 --> 08:35.397
they gave me
a place to crash.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.200
Next thing you know,
we're a family!

08:38.285 --> 08:40.035
-Like for real?
-Yup.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.736
Adoption became official
last month.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.489
They even built me
this cool tree house
to celebrate.

08:45.409 --> 08:46.625
So that's where
this thing came from.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.411
Yeah, I always felt
a connection to it.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.414
-Now I know why.
-It's great, savannah.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.916
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

08:55.052 --> 08:56.618
You said you had
a favor to ask?

08:56.720 --> 08:58.553
Oh, yeah, right. Um...

08:59.723 --> 09:02.474
-So--
-uh, first thing
you should know is...

09:02.593 --> 09:04.726
We haven't been
entirely honest.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.230
Yeah. Our names aren't
really harry and hermione.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.065
-I'm griffin.
-Harper.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.267
We are...
From the future.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.603
Me too. Remember?

09:14.688 --> 09:17.272
Yeah, but...
Further than you.

09:17.824 --> 09:18.773
2020.

09:19.443 --> 09:20.442
2020?

09:21.078 --> 09:21.943
For real?

09:23.497 --> 09:24.446
I have to know.

09:25.249 --> 09:27.616
Are there jet packs?
Robots?

09:27.701 --> 09:28.867
Flying cars?

09:29.653 --> 09:30.619
Harper: Um...

09:30.754 --> 09:32.704
There is
a lot of cool stuff.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.205
Ben campbell is my dad.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.927
-Excuse me?
-Ben? Your friend?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.296
-From camp?
-Uh-huh.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.048
That guy has kids?

09:44.134 --> 09:45.800
-No way.
-Yeah.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.636
Yeah, and my mom's
jessica carlton.

09:48.438 --> 09:49.304
Jess?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.056
How's that possible?

09:51.858 --> 09:54.776
You're so cool,
and your mom is so... Not.

09:58.949 --> 10:01.399

10:01.485 --> 10:02.517
Well, actually...

10:02.619 --> 10:04.402
Ever since you went missing...

10:05.038 --> 10:07.455
My dad felt really guilty.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.324
Why?

10:10.694 --> 10:13.295
Well... I was hoping
you could answer that.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.665
Even after 30 years,
it's still causing problems.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.333
And not just for him.

10:18.468 --> 10:19.334
My mom too.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.470
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.506
It's okay. There's still
a way you can help.

10:25.008 --> 10:26.675
Of course! Anything.

10:27.678 --> 10:29.761
I mean
as long as it's not--

10:29.846 --> 10:31.813
we need you to come
through the hatch with us.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.233
Look, I wish I could,

10:35.352 --> 10:37.018
but I can't leave here.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.487
I mean, ever.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.646
Savannah:
I have a family now.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.314
Griffin:
But they won't even know
that you're gone.

10:49.433 --> 10:51.316
You could sneak away tonight
and be back in an hour.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.735
-We do it all the time.
-And you never get caught?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.070
No, never.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.856
I-- I mean,
practically never.

10:57.974 --> 11:00.275
And what if something
goes wrong again?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.993
Like that falling tree branch.

11:02.112 --> 11:03.278
I could be
stuck there forever.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.779
Well, um...

11:06.283 --> 11:07.782
Please just try
to understand.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.034
For the first time
in my life,

11:09.119 --> 11:10.618
I have a mom and dad
who love me.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.787
If I ever lost that...

11:13.707 --> 11:14.622
I just...

11:15.258 --> 11:16.141
Griffin, she's right.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.678
-It's a bad idea.
-Uh, bad idea?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.912
Hello?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.080
Chicago?

11:22.616 --> 11:24.249
-(bell ringing)
-what's that?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.084
My mom.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.186
Dinnertime.
Do you want to come?

11:28.972 --> 11:31.139
We're having tv dinners,
which are really
just frozen dinners

11:31.274 --> 11:32.607
you eat
in front of the tv.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.226
Thanks, but
we should get back,

11:35.312 --> 11:36.978
try and figure out
another plan.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.448
Look...
I'm sorry, griffin.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.317
I really am,

11:42.986 --> 11:43.902
but it's my one chance.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.487
At a family.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.288
At a family.

11:51.027 --> 11:51.993
I understand.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.295
And I'm happy for you.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.213
Really.

11:55.332 --> 11:56.998

11:57.134 --> 11:58.083

11:58.868 --> 12:00.135

You too.
Bye, savannah.

(whimsical music playing)

12:07.677 --> 12:08.843
what?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.678
I just had an idea.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.849
Probably start a new one.
This thing's
gonna weigh a ton.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.851
Mom! Dad!

12:16.937 --> 12:18.153
You're not gonna
believe this!

12:18.238 --> 12:20.105
-What is it?
-All the cold spots are gone!

12:20.223 --> 12:22.323
Savannah's stopped
haunting the hotel.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.324
I see.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.028
So this hat I found
behind the couch
this morning...

12:27.114 --> 12:28.496
Guess I don't need it
anymore.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.365
Maybe we don't have
to move now.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.668
Well, while I am glad
to see this hat gone--

12:33.787 --> 12:34.669
we're still moving.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.838
But not because
of any ghosts.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.340
You guys know
none of that was real, right?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.259
Yeah? Then why'd
you seem so scared

on the mirror?

12:43.346 --> 12:44.879
Wyatt:
What was that anyway?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.800
That... Uh, was a mistake.

12:49.586 --> 12:50.685
Your brother was missing,

12:50.804 --> 12:53.721
and sometimes stress
can cause a person...

12:54.224 --> 12:55.390
To see things.

12:56.393 --> 12:59.110
Anyway, that's
behind us now, okay?

12:59.813 --> 13:01.112

a lot of stuff

13:01.231 --> 13:02.280

from me anymore.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.313
I understand
if you're going
to see your dad.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.683
Especially today.

21:44.487 --> 21:46.487
I can give you a ride
to the cemetery
if you'd like.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.856
Actually,
I was kind of hoping...

21:48.992 --> 21:50.491
It's fine.

21:50.576 --> 21:51.659
Next time, hmm?

21:53.029 --> 21:54.578
Oh, but do me one favor.

21:54.697 --> 21:55.997
Yeah?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.499
Say hi for me, okay?

21:59.786 --> 22:00.668
I promise.

22:10.213 --> 22:11.512
Griffin:
What's going on?

22:12.965 --> 22:13.714
You wanna tell him?

22:15.385 --> 22:16.350
Change of plans, griff.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.019
We decided to stay.

22:18.855 --> 22:19.687
Wait, what?

22:20.523 --> 22:22.056
You mean we're not
going back to chicago?

22:22.141 --> 22:24.475
Nope.
And you're okay
with that, right?

22:25.478 --> 22:27.361
You kidding?
That's amazing!

22:27.447 --> 22:29.146
Whoa!

22:29.232 --> 22:30.064
Sorry.

22:32.201 --> 22:33.901
Wait, I have
to call harper.

22:34.037 --> 22:34.902
Call her then.

22:36.239 --> 22:37.238
(griffin whoops)

22:38.274 --> 22:40.658
-well, I guess we made
somebody's day.
-Yeah.

22:51.387 --> 22:53.671
(radio whirring,
electricity crackling)

22:59.962 --> 23:02.947
(intense music playing)

23:04.817 --> 23:07.101
where are you?
I thought we were gonna talk.

23:07.236 --> 23:08.936
Oh, well, I've got great news,

23:09.021 --> 23:10.855
so call me back
as soon as you can.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.909
-Griffin, did you hear?
-We're not moving!

23:15.027 --> 23:16.610
Yeah!
Mom and dad told me.

23:17.246 --> 23:19.413
Hey, griff.
I was just
unpacking this thing

23:19.499 --> 23:21.699
and kind of got
the urge to jam.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.118
-What do you think?
-Yeah! Yeah, sure.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.620
You guys
have fun with that.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.625
Let's go downstairs.
Mom's making
banana waffles.

23:31.761 --> 23:34.545
Yes, perfect!
And we're staying.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.013
This is, like,
the best day ever.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.883
Now if we can
just get savannah
to come back.

23:39.802 --> 23:41.602
-Zoey: They smell so good.
-Wyatt: I know, right?

23:46.392 --> 23:48.225
(creaking)

23:48.344 --> 23:50.311
(eerie music playing)

24:19.976 --> 24:21.926
hey! Stop!

24:26.816 --> 24:28.766
Hey, what's up?
You need some help?

24:28.851 --> 24:30.851
(engine idling)

24:37.059 --> 24:38.993
harper:
<i> Next time on "secrets</i>
<i> of sulphur springs"...</i>

24:39.111 --> 24:40.361
-What are you doing?
-Wyatt: Shhh.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.696
<i> It started rocking</i>
<i> all by itself.</i>

24:43.533 --> 24:45.366
Griffin:
<i> It's like it was</i>
<i> reaching out,</i>

24:45.501 --> 24:47.034
<i> like it was pointing the way.</i>

24:47.119 --> 24:48.035
(objects clattering)

24:48.171 --> 24:49.370
hey, guys.

24:49.505 --> 24:51.038
-Did you miss me?
-Griffin: Savannah?

24:51.174 --> 24:53.541
Savannah:
<i> So, a ghost that's not me.</i>
<i> Who do you think it is?</i>

24:53.676 --> 24:55.342
Griffin:
<i> I noticed that</i>
<i> the tumblers in the radio</i>

24:55.461 --> 24:56.877
were set to 2011,

24:56.963 --> 24:58.128
the year
that your dad died.

24:58.214 --> 25:00.681
Oh, you really don't wanna
take bayou road.

25:00.766 --> 25:02.550
<i> You should take</i>
<i> sugar hill instead.</i>

25:03.269 --> 25:05.369
-Look out!
-(horn blaring)
