00:53.720 --> 00:55.472
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:55.472 --> 01:00.352
<i>you've already made the incredibly smart
decision to skip the casinos,</i>

01:00.352 --> 01:02.729
<i>where the odds are stacked against you,</i>

01:02.729 --> 01:05.524
<i>and come to the place
where you can't lose.</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:10.153
<i>Technology is the future,
and video games are leading the charge.</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:15.742
<i>So, step right up and be the first
to experience the world's next big hit.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:19.246
Come try <i>GO</i>, Asia's favorite game.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.124
Rights available everywhere except Japan.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.168
How are you, sir?

01:24.168 --> 01:26.670
<i>GO</i>, <i>GO, GO. Come on.</i>
Wanna play? It's like chess.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.672
Except infinitely harder.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.758
GO <i>didn't go as planned.</i>

01:32.301 --> 01:34.386
<i>I couldn't even keep my salesgirl interested.</i>

01:34.386 --> 01:38.682
<i>And I know how many excuses
bank managers hear every day.</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:41.685
<i>But this is not an excuse.
This is an opportunity.</i>

01:42.394 --> 01:47.107
<i>In fact, my little setback may have been
the best thing to ever happen to us.</i>

01:48.025 --> 01:49.610
- Yeah.
- Tracy.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.737
Tracy. What are you doing?

01:51.737 --> 01:53.947
How's it going?
I just invited this young lady over

01:53.947 --> 01:56.408
to see how our new game
fares with the female audience.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.744
Uh-huh. Sure.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.830
Come on, Tracy. I'm paying you
to sell my game, not play other people's.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.374
Relax, Henk. This game is swell.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.543
- What's it called?
- <i>Tetris</i>.

02:07.503 --> 02:08.628
<i>Tetris</i>.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.130
I don't get it.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.842
It's a combination of tetra,
Greek for "four"--

02:14.593 --> 02:18.138
all the game's pieces
are variants of four-- and tennis.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.556
- Tennis?
- Tennis.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.935
Yeah, supposedly, the Russian inventor,
he likes tennis.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.480
Here, Henk. Try it.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.168
Was this coded in Pascal, or C?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.711
That's proprietary.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.796
You like it?

02:50.796 --> 02:53.090
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen, Eddie.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.508
Heard that line before.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.095
No. It's nothing like <i>GO</i>.
It's in a completely different league.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.263
Heard that line before.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.265
Okay, fine. But, Eddie,

03:02.474 --> 03:06.395
I played <i>Tetris</i> for five minutes, yeah.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.941
I still see falling blocks in my dreams.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.362
This game isn't just addictive.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.030
It stays with you.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.702
It's poetry. Art and math
all working in magical synchronicity.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.786
It's...

03:25.122 --> 03:26.415
It's the perfect game.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.752
Why are you telling me this?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.588
Do you have the video game rights?

03:32.588 --> 03:36.884
Mirrorsoft control all rights
on all platforms, worldwide.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.719
Is Japan available?

03:39.803 --> 03:45.267
Because you're looking at the proud
licensee of <i>Tetris</i> in Japan for PC,

03:46.310 --> 03:47.269
games console,

03:48.437 --> 03:49.271
and arcade.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.481
Is this a joke?

03:52.524 --> 03:57.196
You took the money you owed this bank
for your failed video game...

03:59.448 --> 04:01.825
- ...to buy yet another video game?
- Correct.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.870
But, Eddie, this is different.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.289
<i>Tetris</i> is already a hit.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.999
- Where?
- Russia.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.588
<i>Henk, there is no video games business
in Russia.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:15.881
<i>I know.</i>

04:15.881 --> 04:18.591
Please, let me finish.

04:21.595 --> 04:26.266
<i>It all began with a guy named
Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov,</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:28.018
<i>four years ago.</i>

04:30.145 --> 04:32.814
<i>By day, he worked as a programmer
for the government</i>

04:32.814 --> 04:34.775
<i>at the Soviet Computer Science Center.</i>

04:36.527 --> 04:40.781
<i>But by night, he invented games for fun.</i>

04:51.917 --> 04:57.089
<i>His computer, a Stone Age, Soviet
piece of crap called an Electronika 60,</i>

04:57.089 --> 04:59.466
<i>didn't even have a graphics card.</i>

04:59.466 --> 05:03.178
His falling blocks
were parentheses pushed together.

05:05.514 --> 05:10.060
<i>Alexey and a couple of buddies
from work made the game IBM-compatible.</i>

05:11.228 --> 05:13.105
<i>Which meant color graphics,</i>

05:13.105 --> 05:17.901
<i>8-bit music and floppy disks
that people copied and shared for free.</i>

05:17.901 --> 05:20.404
<i>It spread like wildfire.</i>

05:22.114 --> 05:26.952
But this is the Soviet Union, remember?

05:28.453 --> 05:29.830
Nothing gets out easily.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.458
It would take an entrepreneur
to actually go there and monetize it.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.043
Who?

05:35.794 --> 05:36.795
You?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.048
Jesus, no. I'm not that crazy.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.967
That was Robert Stein.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.514
<i>Two years ago.</i>

05:49.641 --> 05:51.894
Welcome back to Budapest Mr Stein.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.188
<i>A one-man band based in London,</i>

05:54.188 --> 05:57.566
<i>he would travel to eastern Europe
looking for licensed games cheaply</i>

05:57.566 --> 06:00.819
<i>and then resell them
for a profit to the West.</i>

06:02.070 --> 06:03.697
Seen it and boring.

06:09.953 --> 06:10.954
What's this?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.581
This is not our game.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.086
MOSCOW COMPUTER SCIENCE CENTER

06:22.591 --> 06:27.137
This jackass Stein won't stop
faxing us, wasting our paper.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.265
What does it say?

06:30.933 --> 06:33.018
He wants to license my game.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.771
Am I allowed to do that?

06:37.773 --> 06:40.150
We better ask the bosses at ELORG.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.237
Yes we can. Send the fax.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.330
<i>Once the Russians made a deal with Stein,</i>

06:53.330 --> 06:57.501
<i>his next appointment was back in London
with Robert Maxwell.</i>

07:00.087 --> 07:01.880
<i>One year ago.</i>

07:03.006 --> 07:06.218
Mr. Stein, pleasure to meet you.
Robert Maxwell.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.719
Pleasure.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.763
The Robert Maxwell?

07:10.889 --> 07:13.725
- The billionaire media tycoon?
- The one and only.

07:13.725 --> 07:18.146
Okay, now that's the type of businessman
us bankers actually approve of.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.566
Maxwell pays his debts.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.944
And he's heading distribution?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.320
Next best thing.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.947
And this is my son.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.824
I can introduce myself, Father.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.663
Kevin Maxwell, CEO of Mirrorsoft.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.582
Good to meet you, Kevin.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.876
It's Mr. Maxwell to you, sir.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.716
Anyway, gentlemen,
I feel a celebration is in order.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.426
Kevin.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.763
The first computer game
to leave the Iron Curtain.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.851
My old mate Mikhail Gorbachev
will be proud.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.479
We'll start by licensing computer games,

07:59.479 --> 08:04.735
then video games, arcade games,
board games, everything.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.076
Go on.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.997
Great, 'cause you're not gonna believe
where I was yesterday.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.179
Hi. Henk Rogers, Bullet-Proof Software.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.807
I have a meeting with Hiroshi Yamauchi,
your CEO.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.100
Rogers?

08:38.519 --> 08:39.686
Not in book.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.938
Oh, okay.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.023
I understand.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.691
Thank you.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.363
Could I use your restroom before I go?

08:49.363 --> 08:50.781
- On the left?
- Left.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.366
Okay. Thank you.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.343
Hi. I have a meeting with Mr. Yamauchi.
I wonder--

09:11.343 --> 09:13.262
Mr. Rogers, you're trespassing.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.805
Mr. Yamauchi is out of town. So--

09:14.805 --> 09:17.683
That's not true because I saw him
this morning, and his car's still outside.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.767
No, no.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.228
Who is this?

09:21.562 --> 09:22.604
Hi.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.648
Henk Rogers. Bullet-Proof Software.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.873
Not too bad.

09:40.873 --> 09:41.999
Really?

09:45.794 --> 09:48.422
We'll buy you out for 500,000.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.136
Five hundred grand?

09:54.136 --> 09:56.847
Henk, let me get you that drink.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.391
I told them no.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.644
You did what?

10:03.645 --> 10:04.980
Are you out of your fucking mind?

10:04.980 --> 10:07.482
I got a bigger vision, Eddie.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.068
That is why I'm here.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.699
I'll publish it
and cover all up-front costs.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.078
We publish our games in-house.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.997
We don't use outside partners.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.334
You don't do it often, true.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.504
But you do make exceptions.

10:30.339 --> 10:35.719
Because you know as well as I do,
partners are what make us great.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.890
That's why Mario has Luigi.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.312
That's why Zelda has Link.

10:50.734 --> 10:55.113
That's why Mike Tyson has
whoever he's punching out in <i>Punch-Out!!</i>

10:59.701 --> 11:00.994
Yeah.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.169
We want you to make 200,000 cartridges.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.587
You want two million dollars?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.713
No.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.716
Had me worried for a bit.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.052
I need a check for three million dollars.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.139
That's the punch line?
You want a check from me?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.101
And how did you get to three million?

11:24.101 --> 11:28.564
Because I'll need two million
for Nintendo cartridges

11:28.564 --> 11:30.691
<i>and one million to make arcade machines.</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:33.026
I have <i>Tetris</i> for arcade too, remember?

11:33.610 --> 11:36.488
<i>Arcade is a cash business
and the money comes in fast,</i>

11:36.488 --> 11:38.574
which is great for both of us.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.829
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Eddie.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.082
Nintendo is letting me become a publisher.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.961
Nintendo. It's a license to print money.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.925
- You feel that strongly about it?
- Yeah! Clearly.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.802
- Then I'm upping your interest rates.
- Fine.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.888
- And I want your house as collateral.
- Fine!

12:00.888 --> 12:02.848
If you miss one payment,
that house is ours.

12:03.682 --> 12:04.892
Fine.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.854
You sure you don't have to talk
to your wife about this first?

12:10.647 --> 12:14.109
Akemi is the chief financial officer
of our company.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.486
She's all in.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.494
This was not what you promised, Henk.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.290
I know, but you know
how unimaginative these bankers are.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.794
Pioneers have to bet the house to win.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.254
But not literally.

12:35.881 --> 12:36.882
Listen.

12:42.471 --> 12:47.351
Have you ever heard our apartment
this quiet before?

12:55.776 --> 12:56.777
Maya?

12:58.946 --> 13:00.280
What do you think?

13:01.031 --> 13:03.534
It's BRILLIANT, can we keep it?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.621
This is gonna work.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.705
I promise.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.252
Is that a promise you can keep?

13:14.670 --> 13:18.465
If we do this, we're in control.

13:19.258 --> 13:20.259
So, yeah...

13:22.719 --> 13:24.221
it is.

13:35.107 --> 13:35.941
Yoshi

13:38.902 --> 13:39.736
Itsuko

13:42.114 --> 13:43.031
Everyone...

13:47.160 --> 13:49.872
We're big failures now!

13:55.544 --> 13:58.922
We're big PUBLISHERS now!

14:12.394 --> 14:13.812
Low to high.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.607
Set your feet. Low to high.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.233
Tennis in the winter.

14:18.942 --> 14:19.776
Very impressive.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.573
Valentin Trifonov

14:24.573 --> 14:27.075
Central Committee. Communist Party.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.748
I just wanted to meet the man responsible...

14:33.081 --> 14:34.750
for almost destroying the Soviet Union.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.794
Excuse me?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.463
Your game.

14:39.463 --> 14:42.758
It was being played by government workers
across the Union for hours a day.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.344
They were getting nothing done.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.848
We had to create a program
to block it from all PCs.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.522
I'm told you licensed your game
to the West.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.983
Any profits yet?

15:03.195 --> 15:08.367
I can't imagine how a game that is so
popular here makes no money abroad.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.412
Someone is cheating.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.416
Dad can we keep playing?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.668
Wait, wait.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.048
I'm sorry to interrupt.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.466
Again, congratulations.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.968
You deserve it.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.610
- Bullet-Proof, Henk speaking.
- <i>Yes, hello, Mr. Rogers?</i>

15:43.610 --> 15:46.113
Kevin Maxwell, CEO of Mirrorsoft.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.324
Oh, hi, Kevin.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.662
It's Mr. Maxwell to you, sir.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.290
I'm calling because I'm told
you bought PC, video game,

15:56.290 --> 15:59.084
and arcade rights
for <i>Tetris</i> in Japan, yes?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.210
That's right.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.255
Well, it turns out, we already licensed
arcade to SEGA in Japan.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.382
What? When?

16:05.382 --> 16:08.135
<i>I did a deal with your guy in Vegas.</i>

16:08.135 --> 16:10.429
My job isn't to meddle in specifics,
Mr. Rogers.

16:10.429 --> 16:13.015
But I paid for arcade.
We signed a contract.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.101
No, no, no, no. You signed your end,
I've yet to sign mine.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.937
- Hence the call.
- What the fuck, Kevin?

16:18.937 --> 16:20.606
No, it's Mr. Maxwell.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.316
What the fuck, Mr. Maxwell?

16:22.316 --> 16:24.026
<i>You're gonna fucking bankrupt me.</i>

16:24.026 --> 16:26.445
Look, do you want PC and video game
or not?

16:28.071 --> 16:29.072
Yeah.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.575
That's what I thought.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.584
We just lost arcade rights.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.590
Hiro-san,

16:46.590 --> 16:48.467
stop working on the arcade prototype.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.219
Everyone, it's going to be fine.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.139
We still have video game rights.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.185
Henk has a very important meeting
with Nintendo. We'll figure it out.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.436
OK

17:04.983 --> 17:06.818
Congratulations, Mr. Yamauchi.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.613
I thought you should have
your own personal copy of <i>Tetris</i>

17:09.613 --> 17:11.114
before we sell out.

17:13.659 --> 17:14.742
Thank you.

17:15.577 --> 17:19.164
You know how, in <i>Super Mario</i>, when you're
running along and everything's great,

17:20.123 --> 17:23.752
but suddenly a Piranha Plant pops
out of nowhere and spews fire on you?

17:25.838 --> 17:32.302
Thing is, Yamauchi-<i>san</i>, Kevin Maxwell
pulled a Piranha Plant on me and you.

17:34.179 --> 17:38.725
He reneged on my arcade rights, and
I really need a mushroom to stay alive.

17:43.689 --> 17:47.484
Can I get an advance
on my future Nintendo residuals, please?

17:54.283 --> 17:57.786
Mr. Yamauchi invites you to meet
his Nintendo colleagues in Seattle.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.872
We might have something to help you out.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.791
Cheers

18:21.602 --> 18:22.936
Okay, kiddos.

18:22.936 --> 18:29.651
Why don't we tidy our room
before Mom gets home. Yeah!

18:29.651 --> 18:32.154
But dad, my school concert
is next month and...

18:32.154 --> 18:35.449
I just got the song I'm performing
and I need to practice.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.868
But I need your help.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.244
I'm sorry, hon.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.372
Papa's gotta go and get ready
for his business trip.

18:42.873 --> 18:46.543
But I can't wait to see your show, okay?

18:47.711 --> 18:50.589
I gotta go pack. Come on, kids, tidy!

19:05.312 --> 19:06.480
The inner sanctum.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.570
Hi. Henk Rogers. Bullet-Proof Software.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.489
It is an honor to be here.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.698
Hello, Henk.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.992
Minoru Arakawa,
President of Nintendo of America.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.411
- I know.
- Henk Goddamn Rogers.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.831
Welcome to Seattle. Howard Lincoln,
senior VP, chief legal counsel.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.293
Your cowboy reputation precedes you.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.462
Here. Sign this.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.423
An NDA? Why?

19:33.423 --> 19:37.177
Because only ten other people in the world
have seen what you're about to see,

19:37.177 --> 19:40.305
and, to be honest, we don't trust you.

19:55.445 --> 19:56.697
8-bit graphics?

19:56.697 --> 20:01.743
Yes, and a brand-new
Sharp LR35902 core at 4.19 mega-hertz

20:01.743 --> 20:03.871
with eight kilobytes internal RAM.

20:05.664 --> 20:06.790
Impressive.

20:08.709 --> 20:09.710
No color screen?

20:09.710 --> 20:12.671
Color, you'd need eight batteries
instead of four. It's too expensive.

20:13.255 --> 20:17.634
This gives you 30 hours of game play,
all for $89.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.263
What's it called?

20:23.348 --> 20:24.850
It's called the Game Boy.

20:27.311 --> 20:28.770
Go ahead, try it.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.544
We're launching in June.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.547
And we want publishers like you
to be on the lookout for new games.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.549
So, you'll package it with <i>Mario</i>?

20:57.549 --> 20:59.468
Yes, it's our best brand.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.889
This game is programmed in C, yeah?

21:05.015 --> 21:06.475
How many pixels?

21:06.475 --> 21:09.645
160 by 144. Why?

21:24.243 --> 21:27.204
It's not perfect, but you'll get the idea.

21:37.548 --> 21:41.176
Gentlemen, if you wanna sell a couple
hundred thousand Game Boys to little kids,

21:42.553 --> 21:44.054
package them with <i>Mario</i>.

21:44.805 --> 21:50.310
But if you wanna sell millions
of Game Boys to absolutely everyone,

21:50.310 --> 21:52.604
young and old, around the world,

21:54.398 --> 21:56.066
package them with <i>Tetris</i>.

22:02.531 --> 22:03.699
Can you get us the rights?

22:19.590 --> 22:20.632
Hi.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.760
My name's Henk Rogers.
I'm here to see Kevin Maxwell.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.262
Do you have an appointment, sir?

22:25.262 --> 22:27.472
Nope. It's a surprise.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.683
- I'm doing my best.
- No, do not say that.

22:29.683 --> 22:30.893
No, you're not doing your best.

22:30.893 --> 22:33.478
No, it's--
In fact, on a scale from one to best,

22:33.478 --> 22:36.023
you're doing less than zero,
which is fuck all!

22:36.607 --> 22:38.108
The Soviets are not stupid.

22:38.108 --> 22:40.402
They know that <i>Tetris</i> sells.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.572
But they're refusing to engage with me
on arcade rights

22:43.572 --> 22:47.701
until I pay them for the royalties
I owe them on the computer games.

22:47.701 --> 22:51.413
And I can't pay them until you pay me.

22:51.413 --> 22:54.875
- Henk Rogers to see Kevin Maxwell.
- What the bloody hell is he doing here?

22:54.875 --> 22:57.044
- Bring him in.
- Why?

22:57.586 --> 22:59.505
- Well, I should go.
- Sit down.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.133
We are a united front. Understood?

23:04.927 --> 23:08.180
Mr. Rogers, what a pleasant surprise.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.307
Robert Maxwell,
chairman of the Mirror Group.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.809
Wow, hi.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.687
- If I'm interrupting, I can--
- Not all all.

23:15.687 --> 23:18.106
We were just talking <i>Tetris</i> actually.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.109
This is Robert Stein
of Andromeda Software, and my son--

23:21.109 --> 23:23.820
I can introduce myself, Father. Thank you.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.030
Kevin Maxwell.

23:25.906 --> 23:27.115
CEO of Mirrorsoft.

23:27.908 --> 23:28.909
I know. We met.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.871
On the phone.
You sold my arcade rights to SEGA.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.624
Well, it seems
everything's sorted itself out, yes?

23:37.501 --> 23:41.922
Before I forget, this is for the Soviets,
per my contract.

23:41.922 --> 23:44.925
It's a game-play tape of Japanese <i>Tetris</i>.

23:45.425 --> 23:50.848
Though we very much appreciate
your personal delivery, Mr. Rogers,

23:50.848 --> 23:53.684
but you could've mailed it.
You could've saved yourself the trip.

23:53.684 --> 23:58.480
Yes, but then I wouldn't be able
to talk to you about handheld <i>Tetris</i>.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.857
Handheld?

24:02.234 --> 24:05.153
What I couldn't figure out
is who controls the rights.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.197
You?

24:08.740 --> 24:09.950
Without a doubt.

24:11.410 --> 24:12.661
Yes.

24:12.661 --> 24:17.207
Mr. Stein controls all the exclusive
worldwide licensing rights.

24:17.207 --> 24:22.171
That's arcade, video game,
computer, and the handheld.

24:22.171 --> 24:25.549
- We license everything through him.
- Fantastic.

24:26.466 --> 24:30.846
Then I would like to buy
your worldwide handheld rights. Today.

24:30.846 --> 24:33.515
Mr. Rogers,
Nintendo doesn't have a handheld device.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.559
Why would they be trying
to buy into a market--

24:35.559 --> 24:36.852
I can't comment on that,

24:36.852 --> 24:40.355
but I am willing to make
a very generous offer on their behalf.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.441
We'll consider your offer, Henk.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.901
I can handle this, Father.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.029
We'll consider your offer, Mr. Rogers.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.323
I haven't made one yet.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.241
Yes.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.330
Have a splendid time in London.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.296
See you around.

25:07.216 --> 25:08.759
You're excused, Mr. Stein.

25:08.759 --> 25:11.720
And do not bother coming back here
without fully executed contracts,

25:11.720 --> 25:14.556
including handheld <i>Tetris</i>, yes?

25:24.024 --> 25:25.692
We should give the Soviets some money.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.612
They don't care about money, Son.

25:28.612 --> 25:30.030
They care about loyalty.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.657
Premier Gorbachev is my friend.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.992
We're publishing his memoir. We're loyal.

25:33.992 --> 25:37.037
Yes, Father,
the company's pension manager called

25:37.037 --> 25:39.206
and said there was
a few million pounds missing

25:39.206 --> 25:41.416
from the employees' retirement fund
last week.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.545
Yes, we had to rearrange
the balance sheets for the year-end.

25:44.545 --> 25:46.797
- Small accounting quirk, is all.
- So, I shan't worry?

25:46.797 --> 25:47.965
No, you shan't.

25:47.965 --> 25:52.928
But, Kevin, we need <i>Tetris</i>, understood?

26:04.982 --> 26:06.108
Mr. Stein.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.110
Mr. Stein, please. Hold on.

26:08.861 --> 26:10.279
What happened in there?

26:10.279 --> 26:12.197
It's complicated.

26:12.197 --> 26:14.241
You don't control handheld rights?

26:14.241 --> 26:16.869
I didn't say that.
I said it's complicated.

26:16.869 --> 26:19.079
Either you do, or you don't.
What's so complicated--

26:19.079 --> 26:21.707
Have you ever been in Moscow, Mr. Rogers?

26:21.707 --> 26:23.750
Have you ever negotiated with the Soviets?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.420
Do you know what it feels like
to be in a country where--

26:26.420 --> 26:28.130
where everyone is watching you?

26:28.130 --> 26:32.217
No. So, don't tell me what is
and what is not complicated.

26:33.010 --> 26:36.513
I'll pay you $25,000 to secure me
worldwide handheld rights.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.023
I guess it wasn't so complicated.

26:57.492 --> 27:00.412
- Hello.
- It's Howard Lincoln, Nintendo, America.

27:00.412 --> 27:03.832
Listen, I just heard that Robert Stein

27:03.832 --> 27:08.462
is selling handheld <i>Tetris</i>
to Atari for $100,000.

27:09.588 --> 27:11.173
- What?
- Yeah, Atari.

27:11.757 --> 27:13.675
You know how much
we hate those motherfuckers.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.845
<i>But now they supposedly have
a handheld device with our damn game.</i>

27:16.845 --> 27:19.014
I paid Stein to get me handheld rights.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.098
What's happening?

27:20.098 --> 27:23.185
Is Stein cutting you out
and getting the deal for himself?

27:23.185 --> 27:26.438
I mean, if he is,
he's cutting out more than just me.

27:30.150 --> 27:32.694
Are you selling handheld <i>Tetris</i> to Atari
behind my back?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.655
- Kevin, good to see you.
- Do not call me Kevin!

27:34.655 --> 27:35.989
We are not chums.

27:35.989 --> 27:40.702
You deal with Mirrorsoft exclusively,
or have you forgotten your contract?

27:41.286 --> 27:46.333
You mean the contract that gives me
global royalties on sales of <i>Tetris</i>?

27:46.333 --> 27:48.210
'Cause I haven't got any yet.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.628
Okay! Okay.

27:50.128 --> 27:55.467
I haven't secured handheld rights yet,
but just give me some time.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.886
No,
I'll negotiate directly with the Russians.

27:58.554 --> 27:59.847
We're through.

28:01.932 --> 28:03.183
Through?

28:03.183 --> 28:04.434
Through.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.396
Screw it. I'm gonna go to Moscow.

28:07.396 --> 28:10.399
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, you can't
just go to the Soviet Union, Henk.

28:10.399 --> 28:13.902
You need a business visa,
a full background check. It takes months.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.821
Well, I'll get a tourist visa then.

28:15.821 --> 28:19.116
So, you'll lie? That's a felony.
They could throw you in jail.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.325
I'll take my chances.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.660
Who you gonna talk to?

28:23.161 --> 28:25.789
Some company called ELORG.

28:25.789 --> 28:29.751
Companies don't exist in the USSR, Henk.
ELORG is probably KGB.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.087
- Do you guys want this game or not?
- <i>Yeah, course we do.</i>

28:32.087 --> 28:34.173
<i>But you're walking
into a communist country</i>

28:34.173 --> 28:37.301
that still considers America
enemy numero uno.

28:37.301 --> 28:39.845
If you go, we can't protect you.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.014
Okey dokey.

28:43.557 --> 28:45.475
Where are you going now, papa?

29:00.282 --> 29:03.076
- You're Danish?
- No. I'm Dutch.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.245
Yet you sound American.

29:05.245 --> 29:08.248
Well, I grew up in New York,
but I'm Dutch.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.251
And I live in Japan.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.453
- Translator?
- No, thank you.

29:48.455 --> 29:49.540
Hi.

29:50.165 --> 29:51.917
Henk Rogers, checking in.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.797
I don't suppose you know
where I can find ELORG, do you?

29:56.797 --> 30:00.300
Otherwise known as Electronorgtechnica.
It's a government body.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.094
Government? <i>Net.</i>

30:03.595 --> 30:06.431
"No," as in you don't know,
or "no," as in you're not gonna--

30:18.318 --> 30:19.820
We have a new guest...

30:24.116 --> 30:26.201
ELORG. You know, phone number?

30:31.790 --> 30:33.876
- Translation services?
- No, thanks.

30:34.626 --> 30:35.961
- Translator.
- Thanks.

30:43.468 --> 30:44.511
Taxi!

30:46.305 --> 30:47.306
Taxi!

30:53.020 --> 30:55.939
No more fish or meat!

30:56.732 --> 30:57.649
Please!

30:57.649 --> 30:59.318
You must have some.

30:59.318 --> 31:00.819
My family is hungry.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.738
I have money.

31:08.410 --> 31:09.620
Take this. Please.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.038
No. You have a family too.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.665
Please. My family will be fine.

31:13.665 --> 31:14.666
Thank you.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.632
Salutations.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.052
You're in need of succor?

31:26.428 --> 31:27.763
Excuse me?

31:28.764 --> 31:33.185
Succor. Noun.
Assistance in times of stress.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.479
Synonymous with help.

31:35.479 --> 31:37.773
Sasha. Translation services.

31:37.773 --> 31:39.399
Esteemed to meet you.

31:41.026 --> 31:42.444
<i>Do you fancy history?</i>

31:42.444 --> 31:46.782
We can visit Stalin's Seven Sisters,
his palaces for the proletariat.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.283
Or art?

31:48.784 --> 31:50.327
We can go to the Pushkin Museum.

31:50.327 --> 31:55.916
Actually,
where I really need to go is ELORG.

31:57.668 --> 32:00.796
I assumed you were here
for vacationing purposes.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.756
So you've heard of it?

32:18.105 --> 32:21.108
Mr. Rogers, this is not America.

32:21.733 --> 32:25.821
Entering a government structure
without invite is highly illegal.

32:25.821 --> 32:31.451
Sasha, I didn't travel 5,000 miles
to be stopped by a door.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.038
Identification?

32:42.129 --> 32:43.380
Nikolai Evgenievich...

32:43.380 --> 32:44.298
Yes?

32:44.464 --> 32:46.258
Someone for you.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.220
I'm listening.

32:51.388 --> 32:53.932
Yeah, hi. Henk Rogers.

32:56.935 --> 32:58.395
Bullet-Proof Software.

32:59.730 --> 33:05.360
I publish the video game version
of <i>Tetris</i> in Japan,

33:05.360 --> 33:08.405
<i>and I'm here to license
the worldwide handheld rights from you.</i>

33:09.072 --> 33:09.907
What's that?

33:11.241 --> 33:12.284
Where's it from?

33:12.451 --> 33:15.287
I'm sorry. I don't speak--

33:17.164 --> 33:18.457
One sec.

33:18.957 --> 33:21.126
Sorry, Sasha, but I really need you.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.046
It's gonna be fine.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.175
This is Sasha, my translator.

33:28.175 --> 33:30.469
Hello, my name is Sasha.

33:30.469 --> 33:31.845
I'm a translator.

33:33.430 --> 33:34.765
Okay? Okay.

33:34.765 --> 33:36.141
My name is Henk Rogers.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.895
And I publish <i>Tetris</i>
for Nintendo in Japan.

33:46.109 --> 33:48.570
He inquires, "What is Nintendo?"

33:49.071 --> 33:50.948
Ha. Very funny.

33:53.867 --> 33:56.787
Nintendo's the most popular
video game console in the world, sir.

34:02.084 --> 34:06.296
He says ELORG never licensed
<i>Tetris</i> video game rights to anyone, ever.

34:07.673 --> 34:10.259
Only the computer game version.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.886
No, that can't be true. Look...

34:14.221 --> 34:18.141
ELORG licensed the rights
to Robert Stein at Andromeda,

34:18.641 --> 34:20.643
<i>Andromeda to Mirrorsoft,</i>

34:20.643 --> 34:25.148
<i>and Mirrorsoft's representative
in Las Vegas to Bullet-Proof Software,</i>

34:25.148 --> 34:26.233
which is me.

34:28.985 --> 34:30.696
I gave it to Mirrorsoft to send to you.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.411
He denies obtaining a tape.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.791
And says that this is an illegal copy.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.335
Mr. Rogers, I think we should vanish.

34:47.795 --> 34:49.339
He thinks I stole <i>Tetris</i>?

34:49.339 --> 34:50.924
Affirmative.

34:51.507 --> 34:56.388
Tell him I have my whole life
and then some invested in this game.

34:56.388 --> 34:57.681
He's mistaken.

35:01.727 --> 35:04.646
I advise you to leave this
government institution.

35:04.646 --> 35:07.065
Otherwise, as a foreign citizen
on a tourist visa,

35:07.065 --> 35:09.860
you will be sent to prison
for fraud and trespassing.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.238
He says he is not mistaken.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.616
Is that all he said?

35:17.242 --> 35:18.327
Yes.

35:19.077 --> 35:22.122
Sure. Okay, tell him I'll fix this.

35:22.623 --> 35:25.125
We can figure out console,

35:26.585 --> 35:28.921
and then we can talk handheld.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.388
He says return in the morrow
at nine o'clock.

35:38.388 --> 35:41.266
- But I must warn you--
- Okay. Okay, great. Thanks.

35:41.850 --> 35:42.851
Thanks.

35:45.103 --> 35:46.438
You're gonna-- Okay.

35:46.438 --> 35:47.564
Thank you.

35:52.986 --> 35:55.155
I need an international pay phone.

35:55.948 --> 36:00.118
International pay phones
do not exist in Soviet Union, Henk.

36:00.118 --> 36:01.870
But I need to call home.

36:02.955 --> 36:03.956
You don't understand.

36:03.956 --> 36:05.999
I convinced my wife to risk our home

36:05.999 --> 36:07.751
so that I could afford
<i>Tetris</i> video game rights,

36:07.751 --> 36:09.753
and now I'm being told I don't have them?

36:10.838 --> 36:13.465
If I don't fix this, I'm fucked.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.553
Your hotel has phone.

36:18.053 --> 36:19.888
Okay, great. Let's go.

36:19.888 --> 36:24.893
But you must wait in line
as only few wires leave our great nation.

36:24.893 --> 36:26.186
But how long?

36:26.812 --> 36:29.731
Anywhere from eight hours to a week.

36:29.731 --> 36:30.816
What?

36:32.192 --> 36:36.196
Okay, but there's a fax machine
at the hotel, right?

36:36.196 --> 36:40.284
Fax and telex
are in government buildings only, Henk.

36:40.284 --> 36:43.579
Mr. Rogers, a word.

36:43.579 --> 36:44.663
Please.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.179
Do you know who I am?

37:02.055 --> 37:03.307
I've got an idea.

37:04.057 --> 37:05.100
Good.

37:06.810 --> 37:09.104
I assume your translator told you

37:09.104 --> 37:14.151
foreigners are not allowed in government
buildings without formal invitation.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.070
Go home.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.447
Understood?

37:34.713 --> 37:37.758
Mr. Maxwell, Valentin Trifonov,

37:37.758 --> 37:41.094
Central Committee of the Communist Party,
Department of Foreign Trade.

37:41.094 --> 37:42.679
Welcome to Russia.

37:42.679 --> 37:45.057
My father told me to expect Gorbachev.

37:46.475 --> 37:47.893
You're not Gorbachev.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.187
And you're not your father.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.482
You're here for <i>Tetris</i>, yes?

37:57.277 --> 38:00.155
Let's see what we can arrange.

38:11.750 --> 38:12.835
Morning, Sasha.

38:12.835 --> 38:16.046
Any chance I can cajole you
into changing your mind?

38:16.046 --> 38:17.422
Not a chance.

38:19.758 --> 38:20.843
Ready?

38:28.642 --> 38:30.853
Henk, this is Alexey Pajitnov,

38:30.853 --> 38:33.272
the inventor of <i>Tetris</i>.

38:33.272 --> 38:34.356
Wow, really?

38:34.356 --> 38:35.524
Mr. Rogers...

38:36.733 --> 38:40.445
Henk, Mr. Belikov would like you to know
that he doesn't trust you.

38:42.865 --> 38:48.287
And you-- Sorry, these
are not my words-- are a liar and a thief.

38:51.081 --> 38:52.374
I'm also a horrible cook.

38:57.004 --> 38:58.797
That was a joke.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.758
- I don't think he understood.
- Yeah, I can see that.

39:07.014 --> 39:08.599
Please, Mr Belikov continue.

39:13.854 --> 39:15.898
I'm sorry, but who are you?

39:15.898 --> 39:17.232
Please, sit.

39:20.819 --> 39:25.991
The more important question here
is who are you, Henk Rogers?

39:29.161 --> 39:31.580
Your visa says you're a tourist,
but you're not.

39:32.331 --> 39:33.373
A crime.

39:33.373 --> 39:37.878
Your <i>Tetris</i> game says you licensed it,
but you did not.

39:37.878 --> 39:40.255
Well, another crime.

39:41.340 --> 39:44.718
So, here's what I'm thinking.

39:46.011 --> 39:51.934
You go home today, cease production
of <i>Tetris</i>, all will be forgiven.

39:52.935 --> 39:55.270
Or you stay and face the consequences.

39:58.273 --> 40:01.276
I'm not going home without a deal.

40:02.653 --> 40:03.654
Sorry.

40:03.654 --> 40:07.783
"Sorry" will not work in our courts,
Mr. Rogers.

40:09.284 --> 40:10.869
Mr Belikov...

40:27.845 --> 40:28.846
Alexey.

40:30.764 --> 40:33.058
I just wanna say
that your game is brilliant.

40:34.768 --> 40:36.770
Thank you. I speak English.

40:37.521 --> 40:39.398
And I have so, so many questions.

40:39.398 --> 40:43.026
But first, I want you to know that
when I clear up this misunderstanding,

40:43.026 --> 40:45.821
and hopefully secure handheld rights,

40:47.406 --> 40:48.949
I'm gonna make you a millionaire.

40:50.868 --> 40:53.829
- Mr. Rogers.
- Please, call me Henk.

40:56.665 --> 41:02.671
Mr. Rogers, I do not have right
to receive money from my game.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.298
Well, that's criminal.

41:04.298 --> 41:05.507
No.

41:06.258 --> 41:07.718
It is communism.

41:11.096 --> 41:12.681
If that idiot's a thief...

41:13.140 --> 41:14.141
Jail him.

41:16.351 --> 41:18.228
Are the other buyers here?

41:21.023 --> 41:22.524
Keep them separated.

41:22.858 --> 41:26.278
We are going to beat these capitalists
at their own game.

41:30.657 --> 41:31.825
<i>Mr. Belikov,</i>

41:31.825 --> 41:35.621
if I'm a thief, why would I come to Moscow
and proudly show you my game?

41:43.295 --> 41:45.839
Because you want handheld rights.

41:45.839 --> 41:49.343
Yeah, but if I already stole
video game and arcade rights,

41:49.343 --> 41:51.929
what would stop me from stealing handheld?

41:57.184 --> 42:00.896
Mr. Belikov inquires
as to why you mention arcade rights.

42:00.896 --> 42:03.565
I bought Japanese arcade rights too,

42:03.565 --> 42:07.402
only to find out that Mirrorsoft
already licensed them to SEGA.

42:07.402 --> 42:08.779
Stop, stop, stop.

42:16.328 --> 42:20.457
ELORG never transacted arcade rights
to anyone, Henk.

42:23.502 --> 42:24.503
Wait, hold on.

42:25.212 --> 42:28.882
So you're saying the only version
of <i>Tetris</i> you ever licensed

42:28.882 --> 42:30.384
was for personal computers?

42:33.887 --> 42:35.347
Can I see the contract you signed?

42:37.307 --> 42:40.102
Please, it'll help me understand
what's going on.

42:41.395 --> 42:43.397
'Cause I don't know if you know,

42:44.064 --> 42:45.858
but Stein and Mirrorsoft are selling

42:45.858 --> 42:51.029
<i>Tetris</i> video game
and arcade rights worldwide.

43:15.179 --> 43:16.513
Mr. Belikov?

43:17.890 --> 43:20.100
I'm Robert Stein.

43:20.726 --> 43:24.897
I'm here to shore up contracts
for arcade and handheld rights.

43:24.897 --> 43:26.732
Please, Mr. Stein. One minute.

43:27.232 --> 43:28.233
What?

43:31.445 --> 43:34.072
Mr. Belikov.
Thank you very much for agreeing to meet.

43:35.365 --> 43:37.534
Mr. Belikov asks, "What is this?"

43:37.534 --> 43:41.121
Well, I suppose it's <i>Tetris</i>
for Nintendo in Japan.

43:41.121 --> 43:44.458
But I'm here to discuss handheld rights,
not video, so...

43:48.754 --> 43:53.300
He asks if you authorized the sale
of <i>Tetris</i> video games to Henk Rogers.

43:53.300 --> 43:56.303
Mr. Belikov, I run one of the largest
media companies in Europe.

43:56.303 --> 43:59.515
I don't have time to meddle
in the day-to-day aspects.

44:01.683 --> 44:04.228
So, you are saying
that you have never seen this game?

44:04.228 --> 44:07.147
No, I'm saying that
we should move on to today's business.

44:08.690 --> 44:10.067
Do you think it's pirated?

44:10.067 --> 44:11.735
I don't know, maybe?

44:12.319 --> 44:14.154
Can we talk about handheld <i>Tetris</i>?

44:15.322 --> 44:16.698
Tomorrow, thank you.

44:16.698 --> 44:17.866
Yeah.

44:18.367 --> 44:20.327
Fucking commie bastards.

44:24.998 --> 44:29.127
Okay, I read the contract and I agree.

44:29.628 --> 44:33.340
You never intentionally sold
video game rights to Robert Stein.

44:35.217 --> 44:36.552
But here's the thing...

44:41.807 --> 44:44.518
Okay, this is a Nintendo.

44:46.395 --> 44:49.022
And this is a personal computer.

44:50.274 --> 44:51.567
What's the difference?

44:53.277 --> 44:54.987
No keyboard for Nintendo.

44:56.196 --> 44:57.739
No keyboard for Ninte--

44:58.907 --> 45:00.158
You speak English?

45:01.285 --> 45:03.036
Of course you do.

45:03.036 --> 45:04.329
Look, I'm sorry.

45:05.247 --> 45:06.540
Robert Stein screwed you.

45:06.540 --> 45:08.458
But legally speaking,

45:09.126 --> 45:12.880
he didn't steal from you,
which means I didn't steal from you.

45:15.591 --> 45:18.677
Next time, define computers so you can
hold on to your video game rights.

45:27.227 --> 45:28.562
And what about arcade?

45:28.562 --> 45:31.106
There's nothing in that contract
about arcade rights.

45:32.316 --> 45:34.359
<i>That, Stein definitely stole from you.</i>

45:35.319 --> 45:36.612
How much are they worth?

45:37.613 --> 45:39.489
$150,000.

45:44.661 --> 45:46.079
Where does he keep running to?

45:46.830 --> 45:47.956
Mr. Belikov.

45:49.374 --> 45:50.459
Mr. Belikov.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.418
No!

45:54.880 --> 45:58.008
Alexey, we got off on the wrong foot.

45:58.008 --> 45:59.760
Can I buy you dinner?

45:59.760 --> 46:03.138
Mr. Rogers, I'm not for sale.

46:07.684 --> 46:13.190
Is paragraph 40 a more prudent definition
of PC computer?

46:14.233 --> 46:16.777
"Whereas PC computers
consist of processor,

46:16.777 --> 46:18.362
monitor disk drive, and keyboard."

46:18.362 --> 46:19.947
- Yeah, much better.
- Keyboard.

46:19.947 --> 46:23.492
But Stein signed years ago.
What's the point of this?

46:25.911 --> 46:27.746
Oh, no. Please. You're welcome.

46:27.746 --> 46:30.791
Okay. What is going on?

46:37.798 --> 46:39.132
What is this?

46:39.132 --> 46:40.300
New contract.

46:41.301 --> 46:44.513
$150,000 for arcade rights?

46:45.097 --> 46:47.015
Who the hell gave you these numbers?

46:47.015 --> 46:50.227
Who gave SEGA the right
to sell <i>Tetris</i> arcade in Japan?

46:54.815 --> 46:55.816
If--

46:56.567 --> 47:02.364
If I sign this contract,
then we can discuss handheld rights, yes?

47:04.950 --> 47:08.328
I need a night to read the contract.

47:15.544 --> 47:17.588
He says we are done for the day.

47:17.588 --> 47:19.715
But we haven't discussed handheld yet.

47:20.841 --> 47:24.428
He says we will gallantly attack that
in the morrow.

47:26.722 --> 47:27.723
Okay.

47:30.142 --> 47:31.143
Alexey.

47:32.352 --> 47:33.353
You want a lift?

47:34.813 --> 47:35.898
I have car.

47:37.149 --> 47:38.442
Can I get a lift, then?

47:45.949 --> 47:47.284
So, where you from?

47:49.703 --> 47:51.830
I'm from Holland,
but I grew up in New York.

47:52.414 --> 47:56.376
My parents were Dutch
with some Jewish and Indonesian blood.

47:58.337 --> 48:00.631
I'm basically Eddie Van Halen.

48:03.217 --> 48:05.344
Mr. Rogers, I don't need small talk.

48:08.138 --> 48:11.225
Look, believe it or not,
I honestly want to get to know you.

48:12.017 --> 48:15.020
If not as a business partner,
then as a fan.

48:17.814 --> 48:19.733
Come to my hotel for dinner tonight.

48:20.651 --> 48:21.777
No.

48:22.778 --> 48:24.780
Then can I come to your house?

48:27.866 --> 48:32.162
Having a foreigner in one's home
is crime here.

48:33.288 --> 48:34.748
So...

48:37.167 --> 48:39.461
just call.

48:41.672 --> 48:42.673
Great.

48:43.423 --> 48:44.800
Thanks for the ride.

48:45.551 --> 48:48.303
- Guess how long my meeting lasted?
- Two minutes and three seconds.

48:48.303 --> 48:50.848
You, sir, need better manners.

48:52.099 --> 48:54.351
<i>So you are saying
that you've never seen this game?</i>

48:54.351 --> 48:56.478
<i>I'm saying that we should move on to--</i>

48:57.396 --> 48:58.647
You are spying on me?

48:59.189 --> 49:00.315
You bastard!

49:00.315 --> 49:03.402
Careful, Kevin.

49:07.072 --> 49:11.368
Let's take a walk outside. Yes?

49:34.725 --> 49:36.685
What are you offering for <i>Tetris</i>?

49:36.685 --> 49:39.479
The exclusive publishing rights
to our Collier's Encycl--

49:39.479 --> 49:42.107
No. How much money?

49:42.941 --> 49:46.570
The rights are worth two million dollars.
So, you know, it's tit for tat.

49:47.821 --> 49:49.239
More like tit for shit.

49:49.781 --> 49:51.116
Excuse me?

49:52.117 --> 49:53.744
This is fucking Russia.

49:54.578 --> 49:56.663
You people, you don't care about money.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.377
- Where are you from, Mr. Maxwell?
- What's that got to do with it?

50:02.377 --> 50:05.005
Me, I'm from Stavropol Krai.

50:06.006 --> 50:09.843
My parents were kolkhoz,
you know, sharecroppers.

50:10.719 --> 50:14.348
They worked 18 hours a day
on a state-owned farm.

50:14.348 --> 50:16.767
The government took everything.

50:16.767 --> 50:20.687
I realized very young that
if I was going to succeed in this society,

50:20.687 --> 50:24.066
I would need this. Only this.

50:25.067 --> 50:28.737
And unlike you,
nobody helped me get to where I am today.

50:28.737 --> 50:31.323
So, spare me the Bolshevik shit.

50:34.785 --> 50:36.578
Communism is dying.

50:36.578 --> 50:38.205
Soon I'll be out of a job.

50:38.830 --> 50:42.751
Like you,
I want to walk away with the best deal.

50:43.794 --> 50:45.420
You want me to bribe you?

50:46.880 --> 50:48.131
Is that what this is?

50:50.175 --> 50:52.803
No, no. I run an honest company.

50:52.803 --> 50:56.557
Nobody becomes a billionaire
by being honest, Mr. Maxwell.

50:56.557 --> 50:59.393
And nobody becomes a billionaire
by trusting a dirty politico either.

50:59.393 --> 51:03.438
If you are in search of a pawn,
I do suggest you fuck off.

51:04.982 --> 51:06.024
Good day.

51:10.153 --> 51:14.950
$100,000, US, when I get the deal.

51:14.950 --> 51:16.201
No.

51:16.201 --> 51:18.370
That is not what I'm asking.

51:19.162 --> 51:20.038
Boris

51:20.038 --> 51:21.456
Stop recording.

51:24.209 --> 51:25.752
800,000.

51:25.752 --> 51:28.463
Half up-front, wired to a Swiss account.

51:28.463 --> 51:32.467
300, paid when I get handheld <i>Tetris</i>.

51:32.467 --> 51:34.845
Perhaps I'll ask Mr. Rogers.

51:34.845 --> 51:36.597
<i>Henk Rogers has no money.</i>

51:36.597 --> 51:39.600
He reps Nintendo,
and they'd never bribe you.

51:39.600 --> 51:43.562
And Robert Stein is too cheap, so don't
even bother threatening me with him.

51:43.562 --> 51:44.855
400.

51:44.855 --> 51:46.231
Final offer.

51:47.941 --> 51:49.484
Okay then.

51:49.484 --> 51:51.195
<i>And, Mr. Trifonov?</i>

51:51.195 --> 51:55.699
Kevin does not need to know
about any of this.

52:20.933 --> 52:22.434
Why are we taking the risk?

52:22.434 --> 52:24.561
Especially after
what happened to your father.

52:24.728 --> 52:27.022
Have you ever tried to say no
to an American?

52:28.398 --> 52:29.566
It's impossible.

52:38.700 --> 52:40.369
Hello.

52:40.369 --> 52:41.453
Hi.

52:41.453 --> 52:43.997
That's Maya. She's ten.

52:45.123 --> 52:46.542
Julie's eight.

52:47.918 --> 52:49.211
Michael, six.

52:49.211 --> 52:51.129
Leo's three.

52:51.129 --> 52:53.340
And that is my wife, Akemi.

52:54.174 --> 52:56.301
We met in college, in Hawaii,

52:56.301 --> 52:59.888
fell in love,
and I followed her back to Tokyo.

53:00.472 --> 53:02.266
You have lived many places.

53:03.433 --> 53:04.560
Yeah, I guess so.

53:05.602 --> 53:06.603
How about you?

53:07.396 --> 53:08.605
I lived only here.

53:08.605 --> 53:09.982
In Moscow?

53:09.982 --> 53:11.775
In this apartment.

53:17.948 --> 53:21.118
So, Henk, how do you like Moscow?

53:21.118 --> 53:22.202
Honestly?

53:23.287 --> 53:24.913
It's a bit confusing.

53:24.913 --> 53:28.542
Russia is difficult country
to love at first.

53:28.542 --> 53:32.212
Much like our literature,
it's cold and dark on the outside.

53:33.005 --> 53:34.965
But also romantic and inspired.

53:35.674 --> 53:37.801
Nobody sees that side anymore.

53:38.427 --> 53:40.554
How did you find <i>Tetris</i>, Henk?

53:41.513 --> 53:46.268
I was at the Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas, selling a game I had designed.

53:46.268 --> 53:48.645
Then I saw your husband's game--

53:48.645 --> 53:50.439
- And then you stole it.
- Nina.

53:51.023 --> 53:52.858
No, it's fine.

53:54.276 --> 53:56.445
I licensed it from a big company
who lied to me.

53:58.697 --> 54:00.782
But I'm here to make things right.

54:00.782 --> 54:02.409
Because <i>Tetris</i>--

54:03.785 --> 54:05.037
It's that good.

54:09.416 --> 54:11.460
He's dumb. But he is honest.

54:14.588 --> 54:18.550
So you are a game designer, Henk?

54:19.885 --> 54:21.094
And a programmer.

54:21.094 --> 54:24.348
Well, though I've mostly
been doing sales lately.

54:24.348 --> 54:27.351
Pascal or assembler?

54:27.351 --> 54:29.186
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

54:30.729 --> 54:31.813
I like Pascal.

54:32.439 --> 54:33.941
Assembler is my go-to.

54:33.941 --> 54:35.150
But never underestimate...

54:35.150 --> 54:37.152
- ...the power of BASIC.
- The power of BASIC.

54:41.490 --> 54:42.908
That's spooky.

54:48.747 --> 54:49.748
This is it?

54:50.791 --> 54:51.792
The original?

54:59.550 --> 55:01.176
Amazing.

55:05.973 --> 55:07.391
Can I play?

55:11.311 --> 55:12.396
Yes.

55:19.736 --> 55:20.946
It's always been bugging me.

55:20.946 --> 55:23.991
Why can't both lines disappear at once
instead of one at a time?

55:24.491 --> 55:25.534
Because...

55:27.411 --> 55:29.037
I never thought of that.

55:30.622 --> 55:33.250
We should allow up to four lines
to disappear at once.

55:33.792 --> 55:35.210
We should?

55:36.128 --> 55:37.462
What?

55:37.462 --> 55:38.964
Yeah.

55:38.964 --> 55:40.632
Give it a try. No harm.

55:44.761 --> 55:46.847
- Henk?
- Right.

55:54.563 --> 55:56.523
Higher levels equals more points.
So, you'd--

55:57.274 --> 55:58.275
Sorry.

56:06.491 --> 56:09.578
Close. But we need something more.

56:19.087 --> 56:22.716
Life is hard,
and we deserve our small celebrations.

56:22.716 --> 56:24.718
I forgot how much fun this is.

56:29.223 --> 56:30.265
What?

56:32.976 --> 56:34.353
Go, go, go.

56:34.353 --> 56:36.021
- Stay quiet. Go.
- What's--

56:37.689 --> 56:38.982
- Be quiet.
- What is the--

56:38.982 --> 56:40.108
Quiet!

56:50.702 --> 56:53.163
Good evening. Do you have any salt?

56:53.372 --> 56:54.206
Salt?

56:59.586 --> 57:00.420
Neighbour.

57:00.420 --> 57:02.214
Alexey, please!

57:07.094 --> 57:09.805
- What is--
- Sorry, Henk, you have to go.

57:09.805 --> 57:11.265
Okay.

57:11.265 --> 57:13.976
- But only if you come with me.
- What?

57:13.976 --> 57:16.812
We should go out.
But not at some tourist bar.

57:16.812 --> 57:18.772
Show me the real Moscow,
where people like you hang out.

57:18.772 --> 57:21.483
Henk, it is really not good idea. I'm--

57:21.483 --> 57:24.820
Yeah. I know, but sometimes
you gotta say "fuck the rules," right?

57:24.820 --> 57:26.697
I mean, that's why I came to Moscow.

57:26.697 --> 57:30.784
And I think
that's why you invited me here tonight.

57:35.497 --> 57:36.915
This is the place.

57:36.915 --> 57:39.626
More of what you had in mind, Henk, yes?

57:39.626 --> 57:40.711
Yeah!

57:43.172 --> 57:47.509
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

57:48.468 --> 57:49.636
Cheers.

57:50.345 --> 57:51.763
Do you know these people?

57:51.763 --> 57:53.974
I work with a few of them, yes.

57:54.600 --> 57:55.601
Love the music.

57:55.601 --> 58:01.857
Look, personally I prefer
Mozart and Russian folk songs.

58:01.857 --> 58:03.066
Not, you know...

58:11.158 --> 58:12.701
- What did she--
- Folks.

58:14.286 --> 58:16.413
She has news from the Baltic states.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.417
Estonians have taken to the streets,

58:20.417 --> 58:23.462
demanding independence
from the Soviet Union.

58:25.422 --> 58:30.469
All of us are tired of the hypocrisy
and the career politicians.

58:31.303 --> 58:33.055
We all want freedom.

58:34.723 --> 58:36.225
Freedom of speech.

58:36.725 --> 58:38.810
Freedom of art, of expression.

58:42.731 --> 58:44.316
We want Coca-Cola.

58:48.820 --> 58:50.948
And we want Levi's jeans.

58:52.115 --> 58:53.825
And let's drink for this.

59:02.125 --> 59:03.418
I love this song!

59:21.812 --> 59:23.313
Everybody knows the words.

59:23.313 --> 59:24.982
Good ideas have no borders.

59:32.281 --> 59:33.782
- Come sing.
- No, no, no.

59:34.408 --> 59:35.868
Come on. Please?

59:35.868 --> 59:37.369
I don't sing. No.

1:00:17.910 --> 1:00:20.078
Come on. How can you resist!

1:00:30.130 --> 1:00:31.423
Alexey!

1:00:36.637 --> 1:00:38.972
- Now you see we aren't so different.
- Yes.

1:00:40.891 --> 1:00:42.726
Thank you for bringing me here tonight.

1:00:43.268 --> 1:00:44.645
It means a lot.

1:00:53.445 --> 1:00:54.821
Maya, we're going home soon.
Please clean up.

1:01:05.707 --> 1:01:07.751
Akemi Rogers?

1:01:08.335 --> 1:01:11.255
We are from Russian Embassy in Tokyo.

1:01:11.255 --> 1:01:13.048
Who let you in?

1:01:14.091 --> 1:01:15.884
Do you know where your husband is?

1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:18.554
Has your husband called?

1:01:40.492 --> 1:01:44.997
Well, if he does, tell him to come home.

1:01:46.540 --> 1:01:47.833
Immediately.

1:01:52.171 --> 1:01:53.380
You have beautiful children.

1:01:59.636 --> 1:02:00.804
Go home!

1:02:02.431 --> 1:02:04.516
And thanks for the Levi's.

1:02:07.811 --> 1:02:09.897
- Translator?
- No, thank you.

1:02:29.208 --> 1:02:30.959
What the f...

1:02:38.592 --> 1:02:39.635
Henk.

1:02:40.427 --> 1:02:42.971
Thank goodness you're okay.

1:02:42.971 --> 1:02:44.515
What...

1:02:46.892 --> 1:02:49.269
They searched my apartment too.

1:02:49.269 --> 1:02:51.063
But I don't get it.

1:02:51.063 --> 1:02:53.899
I'm trying to help you guys.
Why am I a threat?

1:02:56.235 --> 1:03:00.197
You're a foreigner
attempting to buy Russian property.

1:03:00.948 --> 1:03:04.034
To many, that is tantamount to treason.

1:03:04.034 --> 1:03:05.619
It's just a video game.

1:03:06.286 --> 1:03:07.663
To you, yes.

1:03:07.663 --> 1:03:11.500
But to the men in power
it is a slippery slope

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:15.712
from selling one game to selling
all of Russia to the highest bidder.

1:03:17.589 --> 1:03:22.261
Henk, don't sacrifice everything for this.

1:03:28.183 --> 1:03:29.184
I--

1:03:29.935 --> 1:03:32.062
I'm married.

1:03:33.814 --> 1:03:35.023
I didn't--

1:03:40.362 --> 1:03:41.363
You gotta go.

1:03:49.997 --> 1:03:50.873
Good Morning!

1:03:51.206 --> 1:03:53.166
Peter and Dmitri.

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:55.711
My little tennis stars.

1:03:56.545 --> 1:03:57.504
Off to school?

1:03:58.130 --> 1:04:00.048
You have a good papa

1:04:00.549 --> 1:04:04.469
For taking you so early after
being out so late last night.

1:04:05.012 --> 1:04:07.848
Papa, who is he?

1:04:07.848 --> 1:04:09.099
English?

1:04:09.099 --> 1:04:10.559
Impressive.

1:04:11.101 --> 1:04:13.896
Your mother Nina
is an English teacher, yes?

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:16.732
Well, that's a good job.

1:04:16.732 --> 1:04:17.983
Steady salary.

1:04:19.401 --> 1:04:23.822
Has your father ever told you
what happened to his father?

1:04:25.199 --> 1:04:26.325
No?

1:04:26.325 --> 1:04:28.327
Well, he should.

1:04:28.327 --> 1:04:33.457
'Cause, you know, history has
a very strange way of repeating itself.

1:04:45.552 --> 1:04:49.681
Mr. Rogers? International phone is ready.
You have three minutes.

1:04:51.308 --> 1:04:53.435
Come on. Come on.

1:04:53.435 --> 1:04:56.021
Come on, come on, pick up.

1:04:56.021 --> 1:04:57.064
Hello

1:04:57.981 --> 1:04:59.233
Maya.

1:04:59.233 --> 1:05:00.317
It's Papa.

1:05:00.776 --> 1:05:02.361
Papa! Are you coming home?

1:05:02.361 --> 1:05:06.073
My school concert is soon
and we did a rehearsal today

1:05:06.073 --> 1:05:09.326
and my teacher said I sound
like an angel and...

1:05:10.035 --> 1:05:12.913
Maya, honey.
I promise I'll be home for your concert,

1:05:12.913 --> 1:05:14.623
<i>but right now
I need to speak to your mother.</i>

1:05:14.623 --> 1:05:16.917
It sucks not being able to talk to you.

1:05:16.917 --> 1:05:18.585
Maya let me speak.

1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:21.463
Henk?

1:05:21.463 --> 1:05:24.258
Hi. I need you to call our lawyer,

1:05:24.258 --> 1:05:26.385
have him fax ELORG
my contract with Mirrorsoft,

1:05:26.385 --> 1:05:29.304
and have him draft up
a new contract for handheld <i>Tetris</i>.

1:05:29.304 --> 1:05:35.310
I'll fill in the details.
ELORG's number is +7 495 442 481.

1:05:35.310 --> 1:05:37.396
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Henk.

1:05:37.396 --> 1:05:41.024
Some Russians came into the office,
threatening me to tell you to come home.

1:05:41.024 --> 1:05:42.109
What?

1:05:42.734 --> 1:05:44.319
Akemi?

1:05:47.114 --> 1:05:48.240
Oh, shit.

1:06:06.425 --> 1:06:08.177
- You son of a bitch.
- You son of a bitch.

1:06:10.512 --> 1:06:12.139
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

1:06:17.978 --> 1:06:19.813
Why is Henk Rogers here?

1:06:19.813 --> 1:06:23.192
Are you trying
to play us off against each other?

1:06:23.192 --> 1:06:25.152
'Cause if you're trying to screw with me,
I swear--

1:06:25.152 --> 1:06:28.655
Mr. Stein,
have you read your revised contract?

1:06:28.655 --> 1:06:30.032
Yes.

1:06:30.574 --> 1:06:32.326
Yes, I did. It's not fair.

1:06:32.326 --> 1:06:34.953
You charge far too much for arcade rights.

1:06:34.953 --> 1:06:38.165
And why should I sign
a new contract for the PC rights

1:06:38.165 --> 1:06:40.417
that I already own fair and square?

1:06:40.417 --> 1:06:41.835
Oh, okay, okay.

1:06:43.086 --> 1:06:46.548
I'll sign, but then we discuss
the handheld rights, yes?

1:06:50.260 --> 1:06:52.221
Okay, handheld. How much?

1:06:52.971 --> 1:06:54.223
- We'll come back.
- No.

1:06:54.223 --> 1:06:56.225
No, no. No!

1:06:59.686 --> 1:07:02.981
Mr. Belikov, with all due respect,
what the hell is going on?

1:07:03.941 --> 1:07:06.735
First, one of your cronies threatens me,

1:07:06.735 --> 1:07:09.696
then you threaten my wife in Japan,

1:07:09.696 --> 1:07:11.281
my hotel room gets trashed,

1:07:11.281 --> 1:07:14.368
and now I find out
you're negotiating with Robert Stein.

1:07:14.368 --> 1:07:16.370
After all he's done to you?

1:07:16.370 --> 1:07:18.455
This, this is insane.

1:07:18.455 --> 1:07:20.499
I am the only honest guy here!

1:07:21.250 --> 1:07:22.292
You're all swindlers.

1:07:23.001 --> 1:07:25.170
You're all here just for the money.

1:07:25.170 --> 1:07:27.756
What? I don't speak Russian.
I don't have my translator.

1:07:27.756 --> 1:07:29.299
And where's Alexey?

1:07:29.842 --> 1:07:32.177
You guys, you think that I'm the enemy?

1:07:32.970 --> 1:07:35.430
You're wrong.
This isn't about the money anymore.

1:07:35.430 --> 1:07:38.725
It's about giving Alexey his due
and showing the world

1:07:38.725 --> 1:07:42.479
the Soviet Union is about more
than just missiles and military might.

1:07:56.285 --> 1:07:57.411
What is that?

1:07:57.411 --> 1:07:59.538
Your contract with Mirrorsoft.

1:07:59.538 --> 1:08:02.833
Proving that I didn't steal from you.

1:08:03.417 --> 1:08:05.544
And behind that is my new offer.

1:08:05.544 --> 1:08:07.462
There are no numbers on it.

1:08:08.505 --> 1:08:15.512
$25,000, up-front, for worldwide handheld
rights, plus 25 cents per unit sold.

1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:17.555
$25,000?

1:08:20.392 --> 1:08:22.227
Why so little?

1:08:22.810 --> 1:08:26.023
Because, to be honest,
I got no money left.

1:08:27.983 --> 1:08:30.944
But the royalties I'm offering
are more than fair.

1:08:37.910 --> 1:08:40.245
How many games you expect to sell?

1:08:40.245 --> 1:08:43.457
Conservative estimate, a million.

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:48.086
My estimate is 20 million.

1:08:49.671 --> 1:08:52.466
That means you get five million dollars.

1:08:56.678 --> 1:09:00.140
Oh, come on.
You guys are the kings of cliff-hangers!

1:09:04.228 --> 1:09:05.895
A word, please.

1:09:08.649 --> 1:09:11.151
I have been following your negotiations.

1:09:11.944 --> 1:09:13.694
You've done a masterful job.

1:09:14.321 --> 1:09:18.367
It's all for the Soviet Union,
Comrade Trifonov.

1:09:18.617 --> 1:09:19.910
Good.

1:09:20.077 --> 1:09:24.247
Because the state has decided
that Tetris will go to Mirrorsoft.

1:09:31.796 --> 1:09:32.673
Good.

1:09:33.506 --> 1:09:34.341
Let's go.

1:09:38.261 --> 1:09:39.429
Mr. Be-- Oh, for fuck--

1:09:39.429 --> 1:09:40.930
What's he doing here?

1:09:41.430 --> 1:09:44.184
Foreign Trade is my department,
Mr. Maxwell.

1:09:45.227 --> 1:09:47.979
Okay. Mr. Belikov,

1:09:47.979 --> 1:09:50.274
Mirrorsoft is prepared to offer
the Russian publishing rights

1:09:50.274 --> 1:09:53.359
to its Collier's Encyclopedias,
worth two million dollars,

1:09:53.359 --> 1:09:56.029
in exchange for worldwide handheld <i>Tetris</i>.

1:09:56.029 --> 1:09:58.282
- And royalties?
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Mr. Belikov.

1:09:58.282 --> 1:10:00.200
I just offered you the deal of a lifetime.

1:10:06.415 --> 1:10:11.336
We are prepared to give you deal,
Mr. Maxwell, but times...

1:10:11.962 --> 1:10:13.213
times are changing.

1:10:14.089 --> 1:10:16.758
We are held accountable for our decisions.

1:10:16.758 --> 1:10:20.095
You see, choosing the offer
with no real money looks

1:10:20.971 --> 1:10:21.972
suspicious.

1:10:24.224 --> 1:10:25.225
Okay.

1:10:25.225 --> 1:10:27.436
Fine, fine.

1:10:27.436 --> 1:10:30.022
All expenditures have to be approved
by my board, mind you.

1:10:30.022 --> 1:10:34.443
But, unofficially, I can offer ELORG
one million US dollars by the end of week.

1:10:35.485 --> 1:10:37.905
- And royalties?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1:10:37.905 --> 1:10:38.864
That's enough.

1:10:40.616 --> 1:10:42.117
What did he say?

1:10:50.501 --> 1:10:52.711
One million dollars...

1:10:54.505 --> 1:10:56.381
added to letter of intent.

1:10:56.381 --> 1:11:00.260
We promise Mirrorsoft
worldwide handheld <i>Tetris</i>,

1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:03.555
if you wire us
one million dollars in one week.

1:11:05.015 --> 1:11:06.767
Well, gentlemen,

1:11:07.434 --> 1:11:08.810
looks like we...

1:11:09.478 --> 1:11:10.812
we have ourselves a deal.

1:11:15.609 --> 1:11:17.110
Let me walk you out.

1:11:17.110 --> 1:11:18.862
- But we're not finished--
- Now!

1:11:24.576 --> 1:11:27.412
- Mr. Belikov, the exit is this way.
- Shut up.

1:11:35.546 --> 1:11:36.713
Is everything all right?

1:11:38.382 --> 1:11:41.301
You have one week to make an offer
for worldwide handheld rights.

1:11:41.301 --> 1:11:42.594
You have my offer.

1:11:42.594 --> 1:11:44.596
I'm ready to sign now. What is going on?

1:11:44.596 --> 1:11:47.474
You must sign a letter of intent first.
It's protocol.

1:11:47.474 --> 1:11:50.102
- Are you lying to me, Belikov?
- Listen.

1:11:50.102 --> 1:11:53.856
If you knew the risk I'm taking right now,
you wouldn't ask that.

1:11:54.898 --> 1:11:56.024
Please sign.

1:11:56.650 --> 1:11:57.693
Please.

1:12:02.614 --> 1:12:04.157
And one more thing.

1:12:04.950 --> 1:12:09.329
If you would like to make an offer
for worldwide video game rights,

1:12:10.163 --> 1:12:11.623
ELORG is open to deal.

1:12:11.623 --> 1:12:13.667
What?
Stein has the worldwide video game rights.

1:12:13.667 --> 1:12:14.751
No, he doesn't.

1:12:15.544 --> 1:12:18.005
I redefined "computer."

1:12:19.173 --> 1:12:23.218
Stein needed arcade rights,
so, he signed a new contract.

1:12:24.011 --> 1:12:25.762
Why are you helping me, Belikov?

1:12:25.762 --> 1:12:28.599
I'm doing what is the best for my country.

1:12:29.892 --> 1:12:35.439
Go home, Henk Rogers, and come back with
your Nintendo crew to make a real offer.

1:12:45.657 --> 1:12:46.867
Where were you today?

1:12:47.951 --> 1:12:49.077
Doesn't matter.

1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:50.871
We did it.

1:12:50.871 --> 1:12:54.499
Handheld rights and they're promising
worldwide video game rights too.

1:12:57.336 --> 1:12:58.378
Get in.

1:12:59.838 --> 1:13:00.839
Dzerzhinsky Square.

1:13:07.387 --> 1:13:09.014
You don't have your car?

1:13:10.557 --> 1:13:12.267
I don't want to be followed.

1:13:23.153 --> 1:13:27.908
When I was a boy, my father was professor
at Moscow University.

1:13:27.908 --> 1:13:32.120
And in 1965, a colleague of his
was jailed for selling his book abroad.

1:13:32.704 --> 1:13:34.289
Just for selling his book?

1:13:35.249 --> 1:13:36.583
Yes.

1:13:36.583 --> 1:13:41.964
And my father signed a letter of protest,
which was the right thing to do.

1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:45.175
But the Soviet retribution was swift.

1:13:45.884 --> 1:13:51.306
He lost his professorship and was barred
from holding a real job ever again,

1:13:51.306 --> 1:13:52.641
and it ruined him.

1:13:52.641 --> 1:13:54.977
And it ruined my family.

1:13:55.477 --> 1:14:00.649
And I promised myself that I would never
put my kids through that kind of hell.

1:14:01.859 --> 1:14:03.569
But they are doing it again, Henk.

1:14:04.528 --> 1:14:05.863
And this time, to me.

1:14:15.998 --> 1:14:17.749
Do you know what that building is?

1:14:18.959 --> 1:14:23.046
Well, you should, because they've been
watching your every move.

1:14:26.466 --> 1:14:27.467
Wait. That's--

1:14:27.467 --> 1:14:30.012
That's the member of the Communist Party
at Central Committee,

1:14:30.012 --> 1:14:32.764
one of the most powerful men in USSR.

1:14:32.764 --> 1:14:34.099
Speaking to his agent.

1:14:34.808 --> 1:14:36.059
KGB?

1:14:37.603 --> 1:14:38.812
Sasha is KGB?

1:14:40.355 --> 1:14:41.440
But she's--

1:14:42.941 --> 1:14:43.942
Why?

1:14:44.735 --> 1:14:46.069
Because you are a threat.

1:14:46.069 --> 1:14:50.157
You represent everything our country
has fought against for 80 years.

1:14:52.242 --> 1:14:54.828
And he just found out
that ELORG promised you <i>Tetris</i>.

1:14:56.246 --> 1:14:58.081
Airport right away!

1:15:07.424 --> 1:15:08.550
<i>Tell them it's important.</i>

1:15:08.550 --> 1:15:11.803
It's about <i>Tetris</i>. I'm laid over in Korea,
but only for an hour.

1:15:11.803 --> 1:15:14.264
Sorry, Mr. Rogers. They're in a meeting.

1:15:14.264 --> 1:15:15.724
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

1:15:15.724 --> 1:15:17.684
<i>No, I wanna tell them myself.</i>

1:15:17.684 --> 1:15:19.269
I'll call when I'm home. Thanks.

1:15:21.438 --> 1:15:25.067
Gentlemen. Robert Maxwell,
Chairman of the Mirror Group. Pleasure.

1:15:25.067 --> 1:15:26.568
Minoru Arakawa.

1:15:26.568 --> 1:15:29.738
This is Howard Lincoln,
my senior VP and chief legal counsel.

1:15:29.738 --> 1:15:31.365
How can we help you today, sir?

1:15:34.076 --> 1:15:36.453
I think I've got something you want.

1:15:36.453 --> 1:15:38.872
Kevin, are you there?

1:15:38.872 --> 1:15:40.207
Yes.

1:15:40.207 --> 1:15:41.834
It's good news, gentlemen.

1:15:58.475 --> 1:16:01.019
You see Nikolai Evgenievich...

1:16:01.019 --> 1:16:04.106
Unlike you, I put our country first.

1:16:06.191 --> 1:16:09.152
Don't hurt him too much.
He still has work to do.

1:16:18.453 --> 1:16:20.414
Oh, shit.

1:16:22.624 --> 1:16:23.625
Maya?

1:16:32.134 --> 1:16:34.761
Jesus. No.

1:16:46.398 --> 1:16:48.692
Oh, no.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.869
- Hello?
- Henk, it's Howard Lincoln.

1:16:58.869 --> 1:17:01.955
<i>Listen, I thought I should call you
and tell you in person.</i>

1:17:01.955 --> 1:17:03.665
I-- I don-- I don't--

1:17:03.665 --> 1:17:06.418
I'm sorry, you didn't get
the Game Boy rights for <i>Tetris</i>.

1:17:06.418 --> 1:17:07.753
We gotta go with Mirrorsoft.

1:17:07.753 --> 1:17:09.421
<i>You understand, right?</i>

1:17:11.006 --> 1:17:13.300
- Hello?
- They're lying, Howard. Everybody's lying.

1:17:13.300 --> 1:17:15.302
<i>They're blackmailing me
so I keep my mouth shut.</i>

1:17:15.302 --> 1:17:18.180
But I'm telling you, Mirrorsoft
doesn't even have the video game rights--

1:17:18.180 --> 1:17:22.351
Henk, relax. We just got a fax from ELORG
confirming Mirrorsoft's license.

1:17:22.351 --> 1:17:23.810
It's legit, okay?

1:17:24.561 --> 1:17:26.063
We'll find something else to work on.

1:17:26.063 --> 1:17:28.398
- Wait, wait.
- <i>All right? Bye-bye.</i>

1:17:42.079 --> 1:17:43.330
You done?

1:17:50.128 --> 1:17:52.130
The Maxwells screwed me, Akemi.
They took everything.

1:17:52.130 --> 1:17:54.925
You missed your daughter's concert.

1:17:57.427 --> 1:17:59.012
Did you hear what I just said?

1:18:00.889 --> 1:18:03.016
Did you hear what I just said?

1:18:03.016 --> 1:18:05.352
We've got nothing left.

1:18:05.352 --> 1:18:06.520
Nothing!

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:09.731
It's over, and you're giving me shit
about missing a concert?

1:18:11.275 --> 1:18:12.860
M-- Maya! Sh--

1:18:14.319 --> 1:18:17.072
You selfish prick

1:18:17.656 --> 1:18:18.490
Honey?

1:18:20.450 --> 1:18:21.660
It's fine.

1:18:22.327 --> 1:18:23.662
Everything is gonna be fine.

1:18:25.247 --> 1:18:27.666
Because if it isn't,
then we don't have handheld rights,

1:18:27.666 --> 1:18:29.209
and we don't have console rights.

1:18:29.209 --> 1:18:31.170
And Nintendo will sue us for fraud,

1:18:31.170 --> 1:18:34.381
and we'll lose the business,
and they'll probably take our house.

1:18:34.381 --> 1:18:37.426
And I am trying
to keep it together, Akemi, really I am.

1:18:37.426 --> 1:18:39.261
But I do not have a backup plan.

1:18:43.515 --> 1:18:45.851
I just-- I just need you to understand

1:18:45.851 --> 1:18:48.812
that I did this because
I am trying to build a life for us.

1:18:50.063 --> 1:18:52.774
We had a life.

1:19:12.419 --> 1:19:14.630
Can I come in?

1:19:16.715 --> 1:19:18.926
I devoted my life to this country,

1:19:18.926 --> 1:19:20.844
the great idea of it.

1:19:22.012 --> 1:19:22.846
But...

1:19:23.555 --> 1:19:25.516
I can't do it...

1:19:26.099 --> 1:19:29.019
...This country doesn't exist any more.

1:19:30.604 --> 1:19:33.857
We're turning into a nation of thieves.

1:19:39.571 --> 1:19:41.865
Tetris is going to Mirrorsoft.

1:19:42.241 --> 1:19:46.203
And I will be removed from my position
at ELORG once the deal is signed.

1:19:48.247 --> 1:19:50.541
But you can still make this right.

1:19:56.630 --> 1:19:58.632
Get this to Henk Rogers.

1:20:00.133 --> 1:20:02.094
He'll know what to do.

1:20:34.710 --> 1:20:35.544
Hi

1:20:36.378 --> 1:20:37.212
Hi

1:20:37.963 --> 1:20:38.797
Fire!

1:21:06.074 --> 1:21:06.950
What are you doing back there?

1:22:04.383 --> 1:22:06.552
Kevin, my boy. Okay, get out.

1:22:06.552 --> 1:22:07.845
What the hell is going on?

1:22:07.845 --> 1:22:09.429
Spring cleaning, is all.

1:22:09.429 --> 1:22:13.684
Shredding redundant balance sheets
we had made for our auditors.

1:22:13.684 --> 1:22:15.936
How are you? Congratulations on <i>Tetris</i>.

1:22:15.936 --> 1:22:18.397
I need one million US dollars,
and accounting's saying we don't have it.

1:22:18.397 --> 1:22:21.608
- Why do you need a million dollars?
- Why do I... For <i>Tetris</i>.

1:22:21.608 --> 1:22:24.570
Son, we don't have to pay the Russians anything.

1:22:24.570 --> 1:22:26.572
We're giving them the encyclopedias.

1:22:26.572 --> 1:22:29.533
No, no, no. It was a competitive bid,
and that's the deal I struck.

1:22:29.533 --> 1:22:32.494
The deal is,
I am friends with Mikhail Gorbachev.

1:22:32.494 --> 1:22:34.454
Stop with your damn "we're friends" bit!

1:22:34.454 --> 1:22:36.164
The Soviet Union is about to implode.

1:22:36.164 --> 1:22:39.543
Everyone's snatching up what they can,
and Gorbachev can't do a thing about it!

1:22:39.543 --> 1:22:42.629
Calm down, Kevin. Don't have a hissy fit.
You're not a child.

1:22:44.256 --> 1:22:45.799
Then stop treating me like one.

1:22:47.759 --> 1:22:50.637
- We don't have the money, do we?
- Of course we do.

1:22:50.637 --> 1:22:52.222
- But it's tied up.
- Okay.

1:22:52.222 --> 1:22:54.683
- I'll call the bank. I'll get a loan.
- No. I wouldn't do that.

1:22:54.683 --> 1:22:56.476
Jesus Christ, Father.
You said we were fine.

1:22:56.476 --> 1:22:58.604
We are fine.

1:22:59.104 --> 1:23:03.233
Once we secure <i>Tetris</i> from the Russians
and sign with Nintendo,

1:23:03.233 --> 1:23:04.776
- we'll be in the black.
- Okay.

1:23:04.776 --> 1:23:07.738
But who's going to convince the Russians
to give us <i>Tetris</i> for no money?

1:23:07.738 --> 1:23:08.822
Leave it to me.

1:23:08.822 --> 1:23:10.115
Good job, Son.

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:21.752
Let's sue the fuck out of them.
This is the lowest of the low.

1:23:21.752 --> 1:23:23.378
But that doesn't solve the problem.

1:23:23.378 --> 1:23:25.339
We can send a cease and desist.

1:23:25.339 --> 1:23:27.341
Sir. Excuse me, sir. You can't--

1:23:27.341 --> 1:23:29.635
- Sir, they're in a meeting.
- Well, this meeting is over.

1:23:29.635 --> 1:23:31.887
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Read this.

1:23:31.887 --> 1:23:33.931
- Henk, we don't have time.
- Read it!

1:23:37.559 --> 1:23:39.978
- What the fuck is that?
- Atari stole our patent.

1:23:39.978 --> 1:23:43.398
They hacked the NES, now manufacturing
and selling our cartridges.

1:23:43.398 --> 1:23:44.733
Guess what their first game is.

1:23:44.733 --> 1:23:47.528
- They do not have the rights.
- They do in America. I checked.

1:23:47.528 --> 1:23:49.321
- No, they don't.
- What?

1:23:49.321 --> 1:23:50.864
Who the hell is "A"?

1:23:50.864 --> 1:23:52.491
Alexey Pajitnov.

1:23:53.450 --> 1:23:55.369
"Henk, ELORG and Mirrorsoft lie.

1:23:55.369 --> 1:23:57.746
No rights for <i>Tetris</i> granted.

1:23:57.746 --> 1:24:00.499
Come back and make offer ASAP."
What's he mean, "no rights?"

1:24:00.499 --> 1:24:02.501
You're looking at Mirrorsoft's contract,

1:24:02.501 --> 1:24:04.795
which is just a letter of intent
that expired yesterday.

1:24:04.795 --> 1:24:06.380
- So handheld rights are--
- Available.

1:24:06.380 --> 1:24:07.923
- And video game?
- Available.

1:24:07.923 --> 1:24:09.341
- Worldwide.
- But that means--

1:24:09.341 --> 1:24:12.094
I don't have video game rights in Japan,
because Stein and Mirrorsoft

1:24:12.094 --> 1:24:14.596
never had the right to sell them to me,
or to these guys.

1:24:14.596 --> 1:24:16.849
Wait, you're telling me
Atari doesn't have <i>Tetris</i> in America?

1:24:16.849 --> 1:24:19.852
I'm telling you
Atari doesn't have <i>Tetris</i> anywhere.

1:24:26.316 --> 1:24:29.194
What makes you so sure
this Alexey character isn't lying?

1:24:29.903 --> 1:24:32.906
Because he's the only one
who stands to gain nothing from this.

1:24:35.409 --> 1:24:36.535
What do you need from us?

1:24:36.535 --> 1:24:40.622
I need you and your checkbooks
to get on a plane with me to Moscow ASAP.

1:24:41.665 --> 1:24:43.083
And tell nobody.

1:25:14.198 --> 1:25:15.908
He's back.

1:25:15.908 --> 1:25:17.492
And he brought friends.

1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:20.704
MOSCOW COMPUTER SCIENCE CENTER

1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:23.999
Hello

1:25:45.687 --> 1:25:46.730
What are you doing?

1:25:47.314 --> 1:25:48.607
What is going on?

1:25:52.110 --> 1:25:53.070
Damn.

1:25:57.574 --> 1:25:58.408
Stop.

1:25:58.742 --> 1:26:00.077
What are you doing?

1:26:03.205 --> 1:26:04.081
Sasha!

1:26:04.081 --> 1:26:04.998
What is this?

1:26:05.499 --> 1:26:06.959
You're moving.

1:26:07.459 --> 1:26:11.296
Where? Why? This is my home!
This was my parents' home. You can't!

1:26:11.296 --> 1:26:13.215
What's going on?

1:26:14.466 --> 1:26:16.093
Your husband broke the law.

1:26:17.594 --> 1:26:19.972
I got a call to say the boys
were sent home from school?

1:26:27.771 --> 1:26:29.231
Which will fall faster?

1:26:29.690 --> 1:26:31.191
- Quick!
- Neither!

1:26:39.283 --> 1:26:40.367
Mama, papa!

1:26:40.367 --> 1:26:44.538
We're studying gravity in school!
He's showing us an experiment.

1:26:45.122 --> 1:26:46.123
That's right.

1:26:46.123 --> 1:26:47.332
An 'experiment'.

1:26:50.627 --> 1:26:52.171
Which one will fall faster? Quick!

1:26:52.379 --> 1:26:53.463
Chair?

1:26:54.673 --> 1:26:57.134
Ah, this is where gravity gets tricky.

1:26:57.134 --> 1:26:59.761
The chair should fall faster
because it's heavier, right?

1:26:59.928 --> 1:27:00.762
Yes

1:27:01.388 --> 1:27:02.431
But it won't.

1:27:02.431 --> 1:27:03.432
Listen,

1:27:12.983 --> 1:27:14.359
gravity doesn't care

1:27:14.735 --> 1:27:16.153
if you're as light as a coin

1:27:16.153 --> 1:27:17.321
or as heavy as a...

1:27:18.363 --> 1:27:19.364
Boy.

1:27:20.532 --> 1:27:22.451
Everything falls at the same speed.

1:27:24.661 --> 1:27:26.205
Boys. Go and help your mother pack.

1:27:35.380 --> 1:27:37.299
Henk Rogers is back because of you.

1:27:41.303 --> 1:27:43.722
Ruining your life was easy.

1:27:44.681 --> 1:27:48.894
Cross me again
and you will no longer exist.

1:27:52.731 --> 1:27:54.107
Just like your friend Henk.

1:28:13.710 --> 1:28:14.795
Mr. Belikov.

1:28:17.089 --> 1:28:18.173
Are you okay?

1:28:19.508 --> 1:28:21.802
Sorry for my tardiness.

1:28:29.434 --> 1:28:32.729
So, you want to see new games.

1:28:32.729 --> 1:28:35.357
No. We're here for <i>Tetris</i>.

1:28:36.942 --> 1:28:42.197
But I already informed you via fax
that <i>Tetris</i> transaction is dead.

1:28:43.156 --> 1:28:44.199
Uh-huh.

1:28:44.783 --> 1:28:49.538
And I assume you gave Mirrorsoft
the same deal you gave me.

1:28:49.538 --> 1:28:51.707
A week to make an offer
for <i>Tetris</i> handheld.

1:28:51.707 --> 1:28:52.833
Have they?

1:28:54.793 --> 1:28:56.962
Didn't think so. Here. Here's our offer.

1:28:58.338 --> 1:29:02.050
For video game and handheld <i>Tetris</i>.
Worldwide.

1:29:02.050 --> 1:29:03.135
The money is up-front.

1:29:03.135 --> 1:29:05.637
We'll cover all marketing
and manufacturing,

1:29:05.637 --> 1:29:10.642
and give you 50 cents per unit sold
on both handheld and video games.

1:29:13.645 --> 1:29:15.772
One dollar per unit sold.

1:29:16.648 --> 1:29:19.109
Great. Let's sign, and we can go home.

1:29:19.109 --> 1:29:20.235
No.

1:29:22.654 --> 1:29:25.699
Please listen, I'm negotiating
what's best for our country.

1:29:25.699 --> 1:29:30.579
Protection of the government's property
and decision making is our responsibility.

1:29:33.540 --> 1:29:37.836
He says ELORG needs night
to go over contract.

1:29:38.504 --> 1:29:39.838
It's protocol.

1:29:42.466 --> 1:29:43.675
She is correct.

1:29:44.635 --> 1:29:46.720
It is protocol.

1:29:49.598 --> 1:29:51.975
Good. Time to go, gentlemen.

1:29:52.559 --> 1:29:54.311
I have another appointment.

1:29:58.607 --> 1:30:00.651
Five million dollars?

1:30:00.651 --> 1:30:03.237
And where is your money, Mr. Maxwell?

1:30:03.237 --> 1:30:06.823
I am not going to match
five million fucking dollars.

1:30:06.823 --> 1:30:08.116
<i>And you don't have to.</i>

1:30:08.116 --> 1:30:12.663
All you have to do is wire ELORG
the one million your son promised them.

1:30:13.372 --> 1:30:14.998
<i>Tetris</i> is yours.

1:30:15.707 --> 1:30:17.125
You have 24 hours.

1:30:19.253 --> 1:30:21.880
Why is it so important
that the Maxwells win?

1:30:24.842 --> 1:30:28.554
Isn't the offer with more money
better for the Soviet Union?

1:30:34.226 --> 1:30:37.938
I'll concern myself with the
fate of the Soviet Union.

1:30:39.523 --> 1:30:42.276
You go and do your job.

1:30:45.112 --> 1:30:46.280
Dismissed.

1:30:57.124 --> 1:30:59.418
- Father! Father.
- Not right now.

1:30:59.418 --> 1:31:01.712
Nintendo just offered the Russians
five million dollars

1:31:01.712 --> 1:31:03.463
for worldwide video game
and handheld rights.

1:31:03.463 --> 1:31:05.757
- I already know. Jo.
- Yes.

1:31:05.757 --> 1:31:06.842
Wait.

1:31:06.842 --> 1:31:10.012
Did you say they offered on handheld
and video game rights?

1:31:10.012 --> 1:31:11.096
- Yes.
- Impossible.

1:31:11.096 --> 1:31:13.390
We already have
worldwide video game rights.

1:31:13.390 --> 1:31:15.350
- We licensed them from--
- Kevin!

1:31:15.350 --> 1:31:16.643
You son of a bitch.

1:31:17.436 --> 1:31:20.147
You were in Moscow.
You made a deal behind my back.

1:31:20.147 --> 1:31:23.233
Got ELORG to change my contract,
cutting me out!

1:31:23.233 --> 1:31:26.612
- Someone call security!
- And you, Robert,

1:31:26.612 --> 1:31:29.656
I found <i>Tetris</i> for you
and you pay me no royalties!

1:31:29.656 --> 1:31:33.952
And now, because of your greed,
the Russians erased us from the profits.

1:31:33.952 --> 1:31:35.370
What are you talking about?

1:31:35.954 --> 1:31:39.625
They redefined the word "computer"
in my new contract, huh?

1:31:39.625 --> 1:31:42.794
Cutting me out of video games
so you can steal it!

1:31:42.794 --> 1:31:45.214
We didn't sign
any new video game contracts.

1:31:47.424 --> 1:31:49.927
Oh, you fucking fool!

1:31:50.928 --> 1:31:52.638
I am a fucking fool?

1:31:53.263 --> 1:31:55.307
The bratty son of a billionaire

1:31:55.307 --> 1:31:59.228
who's never done an honest day's work
in his life calls me a fool?

1:31:59.228 --> 1:32:01.480
You self-entitled piece of...

1:32:07.569 --> 1:32:08.946
Come on, mate. Get off!

1:32:09.655 --> 1:32:11.240
Off! Off me!

1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:12.407
Off! Off!

1:32:14.409 --> 1:32:16.370
You, all of you,

1:32:16.370 --> 1:32:18.664
you're all working for thieves!

1:32:19.873 --> 1:32:21.250
Thieves!

1:32:21.250 --> 1:32:24.503
Jo, have the jet ready in an hour.

1:32:25.087 --> 1:32:26.547
I'm going to Moscow.

1:33:01.623 --> 1:33:03.959
Mr. Maxwell. Welcome to--

1:33:08.297 --> 1:33:09.882
Fucking you again?

1:33:15.387 --> 1:33:17.472
Gentlemen, welcome.

1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:24.062
Apologies, but I am gaining weight
and need new suit for today's celebration.

1:33:24.062 --> 1:33:26.398
You look great, General Secretary.

1:33:26.398 --> 1:33:28.692
And you are bad liar, my friend.

1:33:29.359 --> 1:33:30.903
How can I help you?

1:33:30.903 --> 1:33:33.447
Unfortunately, this isn't a social call.

1:33:34.114 --> 1:33:38.368
My son and I are here because
there is an American businessman in Moscow

1:33:38.368 --> 1:33:40.787
who's been manipulating your bureaucrats

1:33:40.787 --> 1:33:43.707
into giving him the rights
to a Russian video game

1:33:43.707 --> 1:33:46.752
that my company already had a deal on.

1:33:47.336 --> 1:33:52.674
In fact, he's just offered your people
five million US dollars.

1:33:53.300 --> 1:33:54.301
And?

1:33:54.301 --> 1:33:58.263
And if this deal goes through,
it will set a dangerous precedent.

1:33:58.263 --> 1:33:59.389
And what is that?

1:34:00.766 --> 1:34:03.352
That communism is dead.

1:34:09.107 --> 1:34:12.027
So, you are here to save my country?

1:34:12.027 --> 1:34:16.073
Once you let capitalists
through your gates, they will never leave.

1:34:16.073 --> 1:34:17.699
And what are you?

1:34:17.699 --> 1:34:20.911
As you said, I am your friend.

1:34:20.911 --> 1:34:25.165
We are proposing a fair trade
where no money is exchanged.

1:34:25.666 --> 1:34:29.378
You get the publishing rights
to our Collier's Encyclopedias,

1:34:29.378 --> 1:34:31.672
and we get the game.

1:34:31.672 --> 1:34:33.465
An exchange of information.

1:34:33.465 --> 1:34:38.720
I appreciate your benevolence, Robert,
but my country is broken.

1:34:39.346 --> 1:34:41.014
My people want freedom.

1:34:41.014 --> 1:34:43.642
Freedom to vote, to choose their destiny.

1:34:44.685 --> 1:34:48.564
Communism was never meant
to prevent freedom.

1:34:48.564 --> 1:34:51.859
But, unfortunately,
human greed got in the way.

1:34:53.318 --> 1:34:58.574
The world is changing, gentlemen,
and Soviet Union will not be left behind.

1:34:59.908 --> 1:35:02.828
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have speech to prepare.

1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:07.332
Would you like my advice?

1:35:07.332 --> 1:35:12.129
Respectfully, Mr. Trifonov, we've got
this far without you, so do fuck off.

1:35:13.797 --> 1:35:16.008
Just get me <i>Tetris</i>.

1:35:16.842 --> 1:35:21.722
Get me everything you know on him.

1:35:21.972 --> 1:35:23.473
The foreigner?

1:35:24.016 --> 1:35:24.850
No.

1:35:25.684 --> 1:35:27.561
The politician.

1:35:57.549 --> 1:36:01.386
Comrade Gorbachev,
look at the respect they show you.

1:36:09.686 --> 1:36:10.687
Alexey.

1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:13.440
Told you I'd be back.

1:36:15.025 --> 1:36:17.528
- You shouldn't have come.
- What?

1:36:18.195 --> 1:36:19.321
You're the reason I'm here.

1:36:20.322 --> 1:36:21.490
You misinterpreted me.

1:36:22.991 --> 1:36:26.745
You literally said,
"Come back and make an offer ASAP."

1:36:26.745 --> 1:36:29.581
I was wrong. You don't deserve it.

1:36:30.290 --> 1:36:32.876
- Alexey, what's up? We're friends.
- We are not.

1:36:33.585 --> 1:36:35.587
You used me to get what you want.

1:36:35.587 --> 1:36:38.131
That is-- How could you say that?

1:36:38.131 --> 1:36:39.842
I'm doing this for us.

1:36:39.842 --> 1:36:41.677
You are doing it for you.

1:36:42.177 --> 1:36:44.680
I don't stand to profit a penny from this.

1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:46.014
I'll make sure you do.

1:36:46.014 --> 1:36:48.892
- It's not gonna be eas--
- Stop making promises you cannot keep.

1:36:52.062 --> 1:36:53.689
We come from different worlds.

1:36:55.357 --> 1:36:58.318
You go back to yours,
and I'll return to mine.

1:37:05.951 --> 1:37:10.289
"70 years from our glorious revolution"

1:37:11.290 --> 1:37:13.876
This is a time of change...

1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:18.839
But I am confident the USSR...

1:37:19.047 --> 1:37:20.632
Henk Rogers' team are heading to ELORG.

1:37:21.842 --> 1:37:25.304
Will come out of it stronger than ever.

1:37:29.016 --> 1:37:30.142
Walkie Talkie!

1:37:32.102 --> 1:37:33.270
Where is Henk Rogers now!

1:37:33.395 --> 1:37:34.813
Heading north on Boshaya Ordynka.

1:37:34.813 --> 1:37:37.357
Don't let these capitalists get to ELORG!

1:37:37.357 --> 1:37:40.652
All agents to ELORG!
Repeat. All agents to ELORG.

1:37:55.042 --> 1:37:57.252
This is not a counteroffer.

1:37:57.252 --> 1:38:01.131
Correct.
It is our first offer and final offer.

1:38:01.131 --> 1:38:03.759
Our IP for your IP.

1:38:03.759 --> 1:38:07.471
And we'll be taking back our video game
rights too, thank you very much.

1:38:07.471 --> 1:38:10.182
- What the bloody hell is this?
- Choice.

1:38:10.182 --> 1:38:15.145
They can choose your shit deal,
or our fair deal.

1:38:19.107 --> 1:38:23.070
- What?
- The cavalry is coming, boys.

1:38:23.070 --> 1:38:28.075
Our agreement guarantees us <i>Tetris</i>
if we make a counteroffer,

1:38:28.075 --> 1:38:29.368
which we just did.

1:38:29.368 --> 1:38:31.537
Depending on
payment of one million dollars.

1:38:31.537 --> 1:38:34.039
- Fuck you. Sign the deal.
- Honor the contract.

1:38:34.039 --> 1:38:36.959
You have less than one minute
before heads roll.

1:38:36.959 --> 1:38:39.169
Mr. Belikov,
do not fall for his shit. Every--

1:38:39.169 --> 1:38:41.171
Father, just pay him the pity money.

1:38:44.675 --> 1:38:46.552
You don't have the money.

1:38:46.552 --> 1:38:49.137
That explains never paying any royalties.

1:38:49.137 --> 1:38:51.265
- Father, what the fuck is happening?
- Nothing.

1:38:52.432 --> 1:38:55.102
It's an accounting quirk
to be resolved next quarter.

1:38:55.102 --> 1:38:56.436
Meaning, you're bankrupt.

1:38:56.436 --> 1:38:58.939
Enough! I could have you all arrested.

1:38:58.939 --> 1:39:01.316
Can we get this done, please?

1:39:01.316 --> 1:39:04.069
- Mr. Belikov.
- You bastard.

1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:07.281
Out.

1:39:11.451 --> 1:39:13.495
You are not safe until you leave Moscow. Go.

1:39:29.553 --> 1:39:32.139
- Where are they?
- Gone, you idiot.

1:39:32.139 --> 1:39:33.599
- What?
- With our deal.

1:39:33.599 --> 1:39:36.185
Maxwell has no money.
He voided the contract.

1:39:36.185 --> 1:39:37.644
I had no choice.

1:39:37.644 --> 1:39:43.317
I run a billion-dollar corporation.
Of course I have money.

1:39:43.317 --> 1:39:46.028
Just not at this exact moment.

1:39:46.028 --> 1:39:47.237
What about my money?

1:39:47.237 --> 1:39:48.614
What do you mean your money?

1:39:48.614 --> 1:39:50.574
Yes, what do you mean your money?

1:39:51.325 --> 1:39:52.784
Are you fucking--

1:39:54.119 --> 1:39:55.829
What, you bribed this piece of shit?

1:39:55.829 --> 1:39:57.164
Behind my back?

1:39:57.164 --> 1:39:59.416
Oh, shut up.

1:39:59.416 --> 1:40:01.752
I was saving your arse, per usual.

1:40:01.752 --> 1:40:04.129
You wanna play with the big boys, Son?

1:40:04.129 --> 1:40:07.132
This is how the world works. Suck it up.

1:40:07.799 --> 1:40:09.801
Where is my money, Robert?

1:40:10.427 --> 1:40:12.846
I delivered you <i>Tetris</i>
on a silver fucking platter.

1:40:12.846 --> 1:40:15.098
All you had to do was pay.
Where is my money?

1:40:15.098 --> 1:40:17.017
Comrade Trifonov we work for our country...

1:40:17.017 --> 1:40:18.602
You whore yourself.

1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:21.021
Fine.

1:40:21.688 --> 1:40:25.234
Get me back my contract,
and I will personally double your fee.

1:40:25.234 --> 1:40:26.902
- No.
- Triple.

1:40:26.902 --> 1:40:28.278
I don't trust your money.

1:40:29.696 --> 1:40:31.615
I want 50% ownership of <i>Tetris</i>.

1:40:33.825 --> 1:40:34.910
Deal.

1:40:39.248 --> 1:40:41.083
Commie bastards.

1:40:51.468 --> 1:40:53.095
- Get in!
- Come on, get in!

1:40:56.265 --> 1:40:57.891
Go! Go, go, go!

1:41:12.698 --> 1:41:14.366
How'd you know where to find us?

1:41:14.366 --> 1:41:17.327
It was easy.
I thought, "What would I never do?"

1:41:18.912 --> 1:41:20.038
Behind us!

1:41:24.293 --> 1:41:25.502
Drive faster!

1:41:38.265 --> 1:41:39.600
Alexey! Alexey!

1:41:44.855 --> 1:41:46.732
What flights are leaving in the next hour?

1:42:04.791 --> 1:42:06.585
- We can make it!
- There's no room!

1:42:07.836 --> 1:42:09.379
Do you trust me?

1:42:13.300 --> 1:42:15.052
Oh, my God.

1:42:28.357 --> 1:42:29.566
Come on! come on!

1:43:00.931 --> 1:43:03.809
<i>Flight 702 to Zurich is now boarding.</i>

1:43:03.809 --> 1:43:05.519
<i>Please proceed to the gate.</i>

1:43:07.688 --> 1:43:08.689
Next.

1:43:10.107 --> 1:43:11.525
What's your next flight out?

1:43:12.359 --> 1:43:14.027
We need backup.

1:43:15.362 --> 1:43:16.488
Let's go.

1:43:26.999 --> 1:43:29.960
<i>Flight 802 to Tokyo via Seoul
is now boarding.</i>

1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:31.837
<i>Please proceed to the gate.</i>

1:43:35.340 --> 1:43:38.010
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1:43:42.472 --> 1:43:43.807
They're coming.

1:43:54.359 --> 1:43:55.235
Sweep the room.

1:43:55.235 --> 1:43:56.820
- You need to get out of here.
- No.

1:43:56.820 --> 1:43:59.865
- I'm staying until you're safely through.
- Alexey, you've risked enough.

1:43:59.865 --> 1:44:01.950
Please get out of here
before they catch you.

1:44:02.868 --> 1:44:06.038
This is not goodbye, I promise.

1:44:07.956 --> 1:44:10.042
I know how much you hate that word.

1:44:10.042 --> 1:44:12.002
But, man, I really mean it.

1:44:13.170 --> 1:44:15.506
No. It's no time for American emotion.

1:44:16.006 --> 1:44:17.257
- Next!
- Go.

1:44:20.928 --> 1:44:22.721
- Reason for travel?
- I'm a tourist.

1:44:38.403 --> 1:44:39.404
Excuse me.

1:44:50.165 --> 1:44:53.377
Please take your seats for departure.

1:44:53.377 --> 1:44:54.586
Move out the way!

1:44:54.586 --> 1:44:56.004
Where is the plane to Tokyo?

1:44:56.004 --> 1:44:57.297
Gate 6...

1:44:57.297 --> 1:44:58.757
But it's closed!

1:45:07.683 --> 1:45:08.517
OFFICIAL BUSINESS!

1:45:08.517 --> 1:45:09.643
We ask that you fasten your seatbelts...

1:45:10.352 --> 1:45:11.186
Open the door!

1:45:11.603 --> 1:45:12.771
OFFICIAL BUSINESS!

1:45:12.980 --> 1:45:15.607
Sorry, we have a slight delay...

1:45:18.110 --> 1:45:19.027
Now!

1:45:24.157 --> 1:45:29.162
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to flight 802 to Tokyo.</i>

1:45:29.162 --> 1:45:30.831
<i>We are now getting ready to depart.</i>

1:45:30.831 --> 1:45:32.416
What the fuck?

1:45:32.416 --> 1:45:34.293
<i>Please fasten your seat belt.</i>

1:45:37.296 --> 1:45:38.505
Son of a...

1:45:39.965 --> 1:45:41.425
They're on the other plane!

1:45:54.313 --> 1:45:55.772
Valentin Igorovich...

1:45:56.607 --> 1:45:59.276
By order of the Secretary General...

1:45:59.276 --> 1:46:03.530
You are hereby under arrest for
abuse of authority and corruption.

1:46:04.448 --> 1:46:05.282
No

1:46:05.282 --> 1:46:06.366
What the fuck is this?

1:46:07.242 --> 1:46:08.202
Move!

1:46:08.202 --> 1:46:10.579
You broke the law.

1:46:10.579 --> 1:46:11.955
I am the law!

1:46:13.248 --> 1:46:14.082
Get them out of my way.

1:46:25.844 --> 1:46:28.680
Is it because I called you a whore?

1:46:38.190 --> 1:46:39.650
This is the end of our country.

1:46:39.900 --> 1:46:40.859
You hear me?

1:46:41.193 --> 1:46:42.569
The fucking end.

1:46:43.487 --> 1:46:44.738
The fucking end!

1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:46.573
It will all fall!

1:46:49.493 --> 1:46:52.204
<i>Welcome to flight 702 to Zurich.</i>

1:46:52.204 --> 1:46:54.748
<i>We hope you enjoy
your flight with us today.</i>

1:47:53.265 --> 1:47:54.516
Maya.

1:47:58.061 --> 1:47:59.396
If you would do me the honour,

1:48:00.439 --> 1:48:03.066
I would love to watch the performance

1:48:03.942 --> 1:48:06.278
I wish I hadn't missed.

1:48:16.914 --> 1:48:18.207
Please...

1:48:30.344 --> 1:48:31.470
OK

1:48:32.387 --> 1:48:33.764
I'll get ready.

1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:41.021
I made a promise to you

1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:44.274
Which didn't go the way I hoped.

1:48:50.989 --> 1:48:52.616
Until now.

1:49:26.525 --> 1:49:29.444
<i>Christmas '89 is about to get
a lot more exciting</i>

1:49:29.444 --> 1:49:32.990
<i>with a brand-new gift under the tree.
It's called the Game Boy.</i>

1:49:32.990 --> 1:49:36.869
<i>Protests are taking place
across the Soviet Union.</i>

1:49:36.869 --> 1:49:40.247
<i>Its maker, Nintendo,
has already sold out twice in Japan.</i>

1:49:40.247 --> 1:49:43.166
<i>And it's on its way
to doing the same thing in America,</i>

1:49:43.166 --> 1:49:47.212
<i>where sales have exceeded $110 million
this holiday season.</i>

1:49:47.212 --> 1:49:50.174
<i>And demand is showing
no signs of letting up.</i>

1:49:50.174 --> 1:49:53.844
<i>Borders are being opened
across Eastern Europe.</i>

1:49:53.844 --> 1:49:56.972
<i>That is in no small part thanks to</i> Tetris<i>,</i>

1:49:56.972 --> 1:50:00.642
<i>the hit new game that has entire families
clamoring to play.</i>

1:50:01.268 --> 1:50:03.353
<i>Mikhail Gorbachev has resigned,</i>

1:50:03.353 --> 1:50:06.064
<i>and the red flag has been lowered
at the Kremlin.</i>

1:50:13.488 --> 1:50:15.365
Is this good news or bad news?

1:50:18.660 --> 1:50:20.204
Probably both.

1:50:21.538 --> 1:50:22.456
This came for you.

1:50:22.456 --> 1:50:23.373
From Henk.

1:50:42.809 --> 1:50:45.103
...for five minutes.
Mom really needs the bed.

1:50:45.646 --> 1:50:47.189
Here they come.

1:50:56.907 --> 1:50:58.617
Welcome to your new home, buddy.

1:50:59.201 --> 1:51:02.538
Is now a good time for American emotion?

1:54:08.557 --> 1:54:10.851
The TV doesn't work. Video doesn't work.

1:54:12.269 --> 1:54:13.770
I've read everything I can read.

1:54:13.770 --> 1:54:16.982
Next stop is the Moscow Go Club.

1:54:17.482 --> 1:54:18.859
Your name is Alla?

1:54:19.568 --> 1:54:22.613
Okay, Alla is going to take us
to the Russian Go Association.

1:54:22.613 --> 1:54:25.699
And then she has also located
ELORG for us.

1:54:25.699 --> 1:54:27.701
This is Alexey Pajitnov.

1:54:27.701 --> 1:54:30.412
- He is the author of <i>Tetris</i>.
- Okay, well sort of.

1:54:30.412 --> 1:54:33.832
I play <i>Tetris</i> with my friends.

1:54:33.832 --> 1:54:35.292
Okay.
