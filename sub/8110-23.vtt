WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.077
[distant sirens wailing]

00:24.792 --> 00:28.062
ARE WE, UH,
ALMOST DONE HERE?

00:28.096 --> 00:29.463
I HAVE TO CALL MY MOTHER,

00:29.497 --> 00:31.232
GET MY DAUGHTER,
CALL THE HOSPITAL.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.167
SO HE DIDN'T THREATEN YOU?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.635
NO.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.837
NO FIGHT?
NOT REALLY.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.439
SOUNDS LIKE A YES.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.212
WAS THERE ANY INDICATION
THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.614
YEAH...
[chuckles]

00:46.647 --> 00:49.550
EVERY MOMENT
I SPENT WITH HIM.

00:49.583 --> 00:53.721
HE'S ALWAYS WAITING
FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.090
BUT THIS...

00:56.124 --> 00:58.159
AND NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.727
NO.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.166
THESE DOMESTIC SITUATIONS,

01:05.199 --> 01:08.236
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
TO GET COLD FEET.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.238
ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO FILE CHARGES?

01:10.271 --> 01:12.606
JUST GIVE ME THE PAPERWORK.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.310
IF GREG HOUSE STEPS FOOT
IN MY HOSPITAL AGAIN,

01:16.344 --> 01:18.612
COMES ANYWHERE NEAR ME,

01:18.646 --> 01:21.749
I WANT HIM THROWN IN JAIL.

01:30.324 --> 01:35.129
[distant chatter]

01:53.381 --> 01:55.316
SO...

01:55.349 --> 01:57.318
WE CAN USE
ANY OF THESE?

01:57.351 --> 01:58.752
YEAH.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.356
(woman)
WHATEVER WE WANT TO HER?

02:02.390 --> 02:03.791
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE THERE FOR.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.326
[chuckles]

02:05.359 --> 02:08.196
[computer key clacks]

02:08.229 --> 02:09.763
HEY. WE WERE JUST GETTING
TO THE GOOD PART.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.433
IS THERE A GOOD PART?
IT WAS PERFORMANCE ART.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.335
THAT'S AFSOUN HAMIDI.
SHE'S A GENIUS.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.871
SHE JUST WON THE MACARTHUR,
LEGALLY PROVING IT.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.308
JUST HAD A RETROSPECTIVE
AT THE TATE MODERN.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.244
NOBODY READS
THE NEW YORKER?
NOPE.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.679
BUT I SUBSCRIBE TO HER
PATIENT FILE.
(Chase)
HOUSE, YOU SHOULD RELAX.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.349
YOU HAD SURGERY THIS MORNING.
MINOR SURGERY,
REMOVING A DRAIN.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.718
PUT THERE
DURING MAJOR SURGERY.
MY DOCTOR SAYS IT'S OKAY

02:30.751 --> 02:33.387
AS LONG AS I DON'T LEAVE
MY HOSPITAL BED.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.356
WHICH DOCTOR WAS THAT--
SEUSS OR J?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.490
NURSE.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.493
DR. HOURANI WROTE IT
IN HIS CHART.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.467
(Thirteen)
I'M SURPRISED HE APPROVED IT.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.402
I'M MORE SURPRISED
YOU ACTUALLY ASKED.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.703
I DO THINGS LIKE THAT NOW.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.473
I'M MAKING SOME CHANGES...

02:52.506 --> 02:56.444
LIKE SKIPPING AHEAD
TO MINUTE 37.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.654
WHAT IS THAT--
PAINT THINNER?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.630
[key clacks]

03:16.664 --> 03:20.234
I'M NOT GONNA WATCH A WOMAN
GET SET ON FIRE.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.270
PHILISTINE.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.377
WHO'S THE GUY WITH THE NOTEBOOK
WHO CAN'T DECIDE WHAT TO DO?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.278
(House)
HER ASSISTANT.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.446
HE'S BEEN INSTRUCTED
NOT TO INTERVENE.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.449
SPOILER ALERT--
HE DOES.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.817
[exhales sharply]

03:39.487 --> 03:42.423
FOR HER, IT IS LITERALLY
HEARTBREAKING.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.894
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.896
ARRHYTHMIA,
HIGH HEMATOCRIT,

03:48.929 --> 03:51.499
AND INCONSISTENT
R.R. VARIABILITY.
YOU FORGOT
ABOUT THE FOURTH SYMPTOM--

03:51.532 --> 03:53.434
BEING COMPLETELY CRAZY.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.735
ONE MAN'S CRAZY
IS ANOTHER WOMAN'S ART.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.806
HER WORK EXPLORES THINGS LIKE
GENDER POLITICS AND SELF-IMAGE.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.474
AND THE PRESSING ISSUE
OF SHAVING YOUR ENTIRE BODY

04:00.508 --> 04:02.343
IN PUBLIC WHILE WEARING
A MONKEY MASK.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.977
SHE SAW HER MOM
COMMIT SUICIDE

04:04.011 --> 04:06.414
AND WAS ABUSED
BY HER STEPDAD FOR YEARS.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.981
DIDN'T SAY THE CRAZY
WASN'T MOTIVATED.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.950
WELL, SHE TOOK THAT PAIN
AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO ART.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.785
THAT'S BETTER THAN A LOT
OF THE ALTERNATIVES.

04:11.819 --> 04:12.986
I STILL VOTE FOR NUTS.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.323
WE SHOULD RUN A RESTING-STATE
FUNCTIONAL MRI

04:15.356 --> 04:17.291
TO LOOK FOR INCREASED ACTIVITY
IN THE DORSAL NEXUS.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.426
SHE'S NOT NUTS.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.894
THE MONKEY-MASK-SHAVING MEDIUM
REALLY SPEAKS TO YOU?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.996
WHAT SPEAKS TO ME
IS SHE'S ELEVATED

04:23.030 --> 04:26.867
BEING FULL OF CRAP
TO A GENUINE ART FORM

04:26.900 --> 04:28.436
AND MADE A FORTUNE
DOING IT.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.470
PEOPLE THAT PAY 20 GRAND

04:29.503 --> 04:31.839
FOR ONE OF HER VIDEO STILLS,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

04:31.872 --> 04:34.442
REALLY DO NEED
THEIR DORSAL NEXI CHECKED.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.377
MAYBE THE PAINT THINNER SET OFF
AN ALLERGIC REACTION.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.412
NOT WITHOUT BRONCHOSPASM.

04:38.446 --> 04:41.349
THERE WAS A SPACE HEATER
NEXT TO HER IN THE GALLERY.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.420
CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.656
IT FITS.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.024
PUT HER
IN A HYPERBARIC CHAMBER.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.804
(man)
THANK YOU.
[cell phone beeps]

05:06.574 --> 05:09.109
LISA.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.845
YOU'RE LISA CUDDY.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.414
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

05:13.447 --> 05:15.549
I'M SORRY.
I'M JERRY BARRETT.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.419
I RECOGNIZE YOU
FROM THE PHOTOS.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.121
THEY BARELY DO YOU JUSTICE.
THE USUAL.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.723
I'M FRIENDS
WITH YOUR SISTER.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.924
SHE SHOWED ME
YOUR PHOTOS.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.993
I-I WORK AT THE BANK
ACROSS THE STREET.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.430
UM, JULIA'S MY CLIENT.
SHE...

05:29.463 --> 05:32.500
WANTED TO SET US UP.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.935
OH, I-I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE ME
MIXED UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.937
N-NO,
I DON'T THINK SO.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.906
I-I'VE SEEN MANY PICTURES
OF YOU SEVERAL TIMES.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.509
THAT DIDN'T SOUND
THE WAY I WANTED--

05:41.542 --> 05:43.110
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
ONE OF THOSE FACES.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.146
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.382
YEAH, S-SAY HI
TO LISA CUDDY

05:48.416 --> 05:51.619
WHEN YOU MEET HER
IN THE OFFICE YOU SHARE.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.122
OH, THANK GOD.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.426
THE I.C.U. ISN'T BEING ATTACKED
BY GIANT RADIOACTIVE SPIDERS.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.292
DID I TEXT YOU THAT?

05:59.326 --> 06:01.429
THAT WAS MEANT
FOR MY DREAM JOURNAL.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.964
I WANTED
TO RETURN YOUR STUFF.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.466
DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T GO AWOL.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.602
I HAD MY WIFE-MAID
BRING IT OVER.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.103
MY SWEATER,

06:10.137 --> 06:11.639
A COFFEE MUG,

06:11.672 --> 06:14.408
A HALF-USED BOTTLE OF LOTION,

06:14.442 --> 06:16.877
AND A DVD OF MARLEY & ME.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.479
GIVEN YOUR THING
FOR OWEN WILSON,

06:18.512 --> 06:20.180
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
THOSE LAST TWO BACK ASAP.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.115
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU MASTURBATE
TO OWEN WILSON.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.551
I MEANT THE BOX.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.019
OH.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.121
IT'S A SYMBOLIC GESTURE.

06:28.155 --> 06:31.525
I WANT THINGS TO GO BACK
TO THE WAY THEY WERE

06:31.559 --> 06:32.993
BEFORE WE STARTED DATING--

06:33.026 --> 06:35.195
NO MORE BAD FEELINGS,
NO MORE ISSUES,

06:35.228 --> 06:37.397
JUST WORK.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.734
THANKS FOR COMING.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.537
I HAVEN'T EVEN SPOKEN TO YOU
SINCE YOU HURT YOURSELF.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.972
I WAS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.174
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.642
I'M MAKING CHANGES.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.878
I'M GONNA STOP DOING
STUPID THINGS.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.516
GREAT.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.585
THE SMART THING TO DO
WOULD BE TO TALK

06:57.618 --> 06:59.853
ABOUT WHY YOU DID IT.
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND--

06:59.887 --> 07:02.022
I THINK I COULD AVOID
PUTTING ANOTHER HOLE IN MY LEG

07:02.055 --> 07:02.956
WITHOUT TALKING
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.694
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO FIND OUT YOU'RE WRONG

07:06.727 --> 07:09.730
BY GETTING ANOTHER PHONE CALL
FROM YOU IN A BLOODY BATHTUB.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.198
I'M A BIG BELIEVER
THAT THE BEST WAY

07:11.231 --> 07:14.468
TO GET PAST THE PAST
IS TO SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD,

07:14.502 --> 07:17.204
BURY IT IN A DEEP PIT,
AND POUR LYE ON IT.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.573
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.208
YOU OWE ME.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.610
FORGET ABOUT SAVING
YOUR LIFE.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.744
YOU EXPOSED MY DAUGHTER

07:23.777 --> 07:25.813
TO THAT OBNOXIOUS
PIRATE CARTOON.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.849
[footsteps approaching]

07:30.851 --> 07:34.121
BRING ME LUNCH TOMORROW,
AND WE CAN PLUMB MY DEPTHS.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.279
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE GALLERY
WASN'T VENTILATED ENOUGH.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.881
HEY, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU,
WE'D BE TREATING HER

08:00.914 --> 08:02.049
FOR THIRD-DEGREE BURNS, TOO.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.017
(Afsoun)
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.786
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE INTERFERED.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.987
(Luca)
I TOLD YOU I'M SORRY.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.121
I WANT TO SHARE
YOUR COMMITMENT,

08:08.155 --> 08:10.691
BUT IT'S HARD
FOR ME SOMETIMES.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.292
LIKE WHEN SHE READ
YOUR LOVE LETTERS IN THE MIDDLE

08:12.325 --> 08:13.861
OF THE NEW MUSEUM?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.697
YES,
I READ THE NEW YORKER.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.231
(Luca)
THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.201
AND WE'RE--
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.771
SERIOUSLY,
YOU WEREN'T REALLY GONNA LET

08:23.804 --> 08:25.238
THAT GUY SET YOU ON FIRE.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.275
HE WAS JUST A PLANT
TO GET THE CROWD GOING, RIGHT?

08:28.308 --> 08:31.311
IF THAT'S YOUR INTERPRETATION,
I WELCOME IT.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.314
AFSOUN BELIEVES EXPLAINING
HER WORK LIMITS ITS POTENTIAL.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.315
BUT BETWEEN US,

08:35.348 --> 08:38.185
HE WAS REAL
AND A TOTAL DICK.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.787
(Foreman)
NO SANE PERSON
WOULD LET THEMSELVES

08:39.820 --> 08:41.288
BE BURNED ALIVE
FOR THE SAKE OF ART.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.724
MY WORK IS MEANT
TO FORCE THE AUDIENCE

08:43.757 --> 08:46.794
TO BREAK WITH THE RATIONAL
AND SEE THINGS IN A NEW WAY.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.162
FINE.
NO SANE PERSON

08:49.196 --> 08:50.931
WOULD LET THEMSELVES
BE BURNED ALIVE

08:50.964 --> 08:52.165
TO "BREAK WITH THE RATIONAL."

08:52.199 --> 08:53.667
I FEEL...

08:56.369 --> 08:59.172
[coughing]

09:00.874 --> 09:02.676
LUCA, HAND ME
THE OXYGEN MASK

09:02.710 --> 09:04.211
BEHIND YOU.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.847
[coughing]

09:06.880 --> 09:08.716
LUCA!

09:08.749 --> 09:10.718
CONGRATULATIONS.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.219
IT'S A GESTATIONAL SAC.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.655
CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
THIS EARLY.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.023
I KNOW.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.091
I JUST FIGURED
THIS WOULD HELP ME PROCESS

09:18.125 --> 09:19.492
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.195
THERE'S A LOT
WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT.
WE HAVE
ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.330
YOU'RE NOT HAVING DOUBTS,
ARE YOU?

09:23.363 --> 09:24.798
NO.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.799
ARE YOU?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.768
DEFINITELY NOT.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.273
NICE, COZY HOME
FOR LITTLE RUBEN.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.609
IT'S A FAMILY NAME.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.144
IT'S A SANDWICH.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.246
NAMED FOR MY FAMILY.

09:39.279 --> 09:43.884
[as cell phone ringtone]
* IF YOU LIKE PIÑA COLADAS

09:43.917 --> 09:44.885
*

09:44.918 --> 09:46.253
[music stops]

09:46.286 --> 09:49.289
IT'S JUST HOUSE.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.928
I SWEAR TO GOD,
STAY OUT OF MY PERSONAL LIFE.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.196
WHERE IS THE DOWNSIDE HERE?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.065
HUH?
JERRY IS CUTE.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.733
HE'S A SENIOR V.P.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.269
HE KITE-SURFS
IN COSTA RICA EVERY WINTER,

10:02.302 --> 10:04.304
AND HE LOVES HIS MOTHER.
SEASONALLY?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.173
OR IS THAT
JUST THE KITE-SURFING?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.207
IS THIS ABOUT HOUSE?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.809
WHAT?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.745
LIKE I SECRETLY WISH
I COULD ALTER

10:11.779 --> 10:13.981
THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE,
CHANGE WHO WE ARE,

10:14.014 --> 10:15.415
AND MAGICALLY
MAKE IT WORK OUT?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.350
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M ASKING.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.819
MY SARCASM INDICATED NO.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.220
NO, YOUR SARCASM INDICATED

10:20.253 --> 10:23.724
YOU WANTED TO AVOID
ACTUALLY SAYING ANYTHING.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.659
LOOK, LISA...

10:27.194 --> 10:30.130
ALL I KNOW
IS YOU SEEM STUCK.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.065
AND I DON'T LIKE SEEING YOU
LIKE THAT.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.336
SHE GOT WORSE
IN THE HYPERBARIC CHAMBER.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.938
IT'S NOT C.O. POISONING.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.239
I THINK
WE SHOULD CONSIDER INFECTION

10:39.272 --> 10:40.307
AND TEST THE ASSISTANT.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.275
I COULDN'T GET HIS ATTENTION.
HE WAS IN A DAZE.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.311
YOU THINK THAT'S A SYMPTOM?
HE'S IN LOVE WITH HER.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.747
HE WAS PROBABLY OVERWHELMED,
COULDN'T DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.349
WHAT'S HE BEEN DOING
SINCE SHE WAS ADMITTED?

10:49.382 --> 10:51.084
DID HE BRING ANYTHING

10:51.118 --> 10:52.786
FROM THE PATIENT ROOM
TO THE TREATMENT ROOM?

10:52.820 --> 10:53.787
A FEW THINGS--
A HANDBAG,

10:53.821 --> 10:56.123
FLOWERS,
STUFFED ELEPHANT.

10:56.156 --> 11:00.227
DOES SHE SEEM
LIKE THE KIND OF WOMAN

11:00.260 --> 11:03.163
WHO NEEDS A STUFFED ANIMAL?

11:04.765 --> 11:07.367
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
[cell phone ringing]

11:07.400 --> 11:09.336
OH, OF COURSE.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.807
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

11:13.841 --> 11:16.744
OH, I CAN SEE
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.279
GO TO HER ROOM.

11:27.955 --> 11:32.292
(House)
NOW GO ADDRESS
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.438
THIS IS A NANNY CAM.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.875
(House)
THE REASON LUCA
COULDN'T DECIDE

11:47.908 --> 11:49.376
WHAT TO DO
IN THE TREATMENT ROOM

11:49.409 --> 11:51.011
IS THE SAME
AS IN THE GALLERY.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.980
HE'S BEEN TOLD
NOT TO INTERVENE.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.915
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.217
WE'VE BECOME
HER LATEST WORK OF ART.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.124
(Thirteen)
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE SURPRISED US.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.893
ALL HER WORK
IS BASED ON PERSONAL TRAUMAS.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.928
SHE'S HAD LUCA TAKING NOTES,
VIDEOTAPE HER TREATMENTS,

12:07.961 --> 12:09.930
COLLECT THINGS,
LIKE SHARPS AND BANDAGES.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.531
IT'LL ALL GO
INTO A GALLERY INSTALLATION.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.565
(Taub)
WELL, THEN I GUESS AS LONG

12:12.599 --> 12:14.467
AS LONG AS THE EXPLOITATION
IS PROPERLY MOTIVATED,

12:14.501 --> 12:16.003
IT'S ALL OKAY.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.106
* IF YOU LIKE PIÑA COLADAS

12:19.139 --> 12:21.141
[music stops]
(Chase)
ULTRASOUND SHOWED A CYST

12:21.174 --> 12:22.275
ON HER PANCREAS--
WE DRAINED IT.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.044
(Taub)
WHY ARE WE EVEN DISCUSSING
THIS CASE?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.378
SHE LIED TO US.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.947
IT'S OPENING US UP
TO MALPRACTICE.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.082
OUR PRACTICE OPENS US UP
TO MALPRACTICE.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.084
HOW DO WE KNOW
SHE'S ACTUALLY SICK?
HER BEING SICK IS A CLUE.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.920
SHE WOULD HAVE LET
THAT GUY

12:32.953 --> 12:34.421
SET HER ON FIRE
FOR THE SAKE OF HER WORK.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.223
YOU THINK SHE'S SCARED
OF A LITTLE ARRHYTHMIA?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.791
SHE PROBABLY
HUFFED PAINT THINNER.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.292
SHE WOULD HAVE LET HIM
SET HER ON FIRE

12:39.326 --> 12:41.194
BECAUSE OF THE HONESTY
OF HER WORK.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.796
FAKING AN ILLNESS
DOESN'T FIT.
THIRTEEN'S RIGHT--

12:42.830 --> 12:44.297
AT LEAST HER CONCLUSION WAS.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.099
EVERYTHING ELSE
WAS LAUGHABLY WRONG.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.235
IF THE PATIENT
INDUCED PANCREATITIS

12:48.268 --> 12:50.103
AND A HEART ATTACK,
SHE'D BE SUICIDAL.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.806
EXACTLY. SHE'S RISKING
HER LIFE ALL THE TIME.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.007
EXACTLY.
IF SHE WANTED TO BE DEAD,

12:54.041 --> 12:55.142
SHE'D BE DEAD
A LONG TIME AGO.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.845
PRETENDING TO CHEAT DEATH
PAYS BETTER THAN WATER COLORS.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.113
COXSACKIE B FITS.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.448
BUT DO A SPIRAL C.T.
OF HER BILIARY TREE

13:01.481 --> 13:03.016
TO RULE OUT GALLSTONES.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.551
FINE.
I'LL GET THE C.T.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.153
SURE. I'D BE HAPPY
TO COME WITH YOU.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.121
THANKS FOR ASKING.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.023
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO STAY IN BED--

13:10.057 --> 13:11.091
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.060
IF YOU REALLY CARED
ABOUT ME,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.262
YOU WOULDN'T BE SO OBVIOUS
WHEN YOU SCHEME

13:15.295 --> 13:16.830
TO PROVE ME WRONG.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.599
YOU VOLUNTEERED BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO C.T. HER LUNGS,

13:19.632 --> 13:20.834
NOT HER BILIARY TREE.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.969
YOU WANT TO FIND FIBROSIS

13:22.002 --> 13:23.370
AND PROVE
YOUR "PAINT THINNER" THEORY.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.205
IF I DON'T COME WITH,
WHEN YOU FAIL,

13:25.238 --> 13:27.574
YOU'LL PRETEND
YOU NEVER TRIED.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.843
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A CHOICE, NOW, DO I?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.820
[House whistling]

13:54.167 --> 13:59.139
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOUR PAYCHECK,
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.574
CANNED BEANS
AREN'T SO BAD...

14:01.608 --> 14:04.644
AS LONG AS THEY'RE COOKED
OVER AN OIL-DRUM FIRE

14:04.677 --> 14:08.115
UNDER A BRIDGE
WITH THE KING OF THE HOBOS.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.483
(Afsoun)
I FEEL DIZZY.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.386
[machine beeping]

14:13.420 --> 14:16.523
[beep]

14:16.556 --> 14:18.892
PALE,
DIAPHORETIC,

14:18.926 --> 14:20.093
TACHYCARDIC,

14:20.127 --> 14:22.529
B.P.,
80 OVER 40.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.432
INTERNAL BLEEDING?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.234
GET HER OUT OF HERE
AND SCOPE HER.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.278
(Chase)
I'M SO SORRY.
OOH.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.213
THE COLONOSCOPY
DIDN'T FIND THE BLEED,

14:40.247 --> 14:42.282
SO WE GOT TO LOOK
BY YOUR LIVER.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.252
LUCA, PLEASE.
WE NEED TO DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.987
OOH.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.421
[camera shutter clicking]
HOLD THIS.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.134
I'M JUST BELOW
THE CELIAC ARTERY.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.303
NO BLOOD.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.006
COULD IT BE LEAKING
INTO HER THIGHS?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.175
NO SWELLING,
NO ASYMMETRY.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.209
SO WHERE'S THE BLOOD GOING?

15:14.181 --> 15:16.649
(Chase)
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING DOWN THERE?

15:16.683 --> 15:19.452
'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE BEANS.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.358
YOU STOOD ME UP.
SORRY.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.693
SHOULD HAVE SCHEDULED

15:26.726 --> 15:28.528
MY PATIENT'S INTERNAL BLEEDING
FOR THURSDAY.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.098
YOU'RE STILL PLAYING THE SAME
PETTY, PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE GAMES.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.733
GOT YOU TO GO ALL THE WAY
TO THE SECOND FLOOR

15:33.766 --> 15:35.468
OF A BUILDING
YOU WORK IN.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.070
BOY, DID I SCREW WITH YOU.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.039
YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO CHANGE.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.440
CHECK THE SIGN.
IT SAYS YOU GOT TO TREAT ME

15:40.473 --> 15:41.975
WITH INTENSIVE CARE.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.343
I'M EXPRESSING MY ANGER.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.313
RIGHT NOW, LET'S FINALLY HAVE
OUR FIGHT.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.115
ALL WE DO IS FIGHT.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.183
NO, ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS PULL PRANKS

15:50.217 --> 15:53.086
OR HAVE TEMPER TANTRUMS
WITH WILSON, NEVER ME,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.588
MARRY MAIL-ORDER PROSTITUTES,
MAKE ME GO TO YOUR WEDDING--

15:55.622 --> 15:58.225
DOMINIKA IS
A LICENSED AESTHETICIAN.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.060
YOU CUT OPEN
YOUR OWN LEG.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.429
SO ALL THIS WAS ABOUT YOU?
YOU DON'T THINK
IT WAS EVEN RELATED?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.231
HOUSE, WE'VE NEVER EVEN HAD
A CONVERSATION

16:04.264 --> 16:05.098
ABOUT OUR BREAKUP.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.334
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY
STILL ANGRY AT ME.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.036
AND IT'S HURTING
BOTH OF US.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.304
WOW, I HADN'T REALIZED
THE INCREDIBLE HEALING POWER

16:11.338 --> 16:13.240
OF LUNCH.
I KNOW ONE CONVERSATION

16:13.273 --> 16:14.641
ISN'T GONNA SOLVE
EVERYTHING,

16:14.674 --> 16:16.509
BUT IT IS A START.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.112
IT'S A PRIVACY CURTAIN.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.282
IT WASN'T WORKING.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.219
LUNCH AT 1:00,
TOMORROW IN THE CAFETERIA.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.155
YOU HAPPY?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.329
(Foreman)
HOW MANY OF THOSE
HAVE YOU HAD TODAY?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.698
I DON'T KNOW.
IS "YOUR MOTHER" A NUMBER?

16:38.731 --> 16:40.700
THE PATIENT IS A FRAUD.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.370
I FOUND A PUNCTURE IN THE
DORSAL VEIN OF HER LEFT FOOT.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.505
SHOOTING UP HEROIN
WOULDN'T EXPLAIN--
NOT HEROIN.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.574
SHE WAS INJECTING HERSELF
WITH HER OWN RED BLOOD CELLS.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.210
IT CAUSED HER HEART ISSUES, AND
WHEN HER HEMATOCRIT EVENED OUT,

16:50.243 --> 16:51.444
WE MISTOOK IT
FOR INTERNAL BLEEDING.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.480
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A VERY DISTINCTIVELY SHAPED

16:53.513 --> 16:56.449
AND AWFULLY TALKATIVE PUNCTURE
FOR YOU TO GET ALL OF THAT.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.818
BROWSER HISTORY
ON HER LAPTOP HELPED.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.254
SHE WAS RESEARCHING
BLOOD DOPING

17:01.288 --> 17:05.092
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.462
SHE WAS RESEARCHING ME?
FOR MONTHS.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.131
THIS ISN'T ABOUT CREATING ART
IN THE MOMENT.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.799
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.502
SHE SET YOU UP.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.852
WE SENT A UNI OVER TO
HIS APARTMENT AND THE HOSPITAL.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.088
YEAH, HE WON'T BE THERE.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.590
ANY IDEAS?

17:37.624 --> 17:39.259
WHEN YOU FIND HIM,
YOU'RE GONNA ARREST HIM?

17:39.292 --> 17:43.863
IS THERE SOME REASON
YOU THINK I SHOULDN'T?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.699
KNOWING HIM,
HE'LL BE IN A BAR.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.137
HE'LL FIND ONE THAT MATCHES
HOW HE FEELS INSIDE.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.839
IT'LL BE THE MOST DARK,

17:52.872 --> 17:56.075
DEPRESSING HOLE
YOU CAN FIND IN NEW JERSEY.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.848
NOW YOU'RE JUST
PISSING ME OFF.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.184
KNOW SHE RESEARCHED YOU.
I'M REALLY SORRY. I-I DIDN'T
(Luca)

18:04.217 --> 18:05.285
I HAD NO IDEA SHE--

18:05.318 --> 18:07.420
IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
THEN WHY ARE YOU TALKING?

18:07.454 --> 18:08.888
(Afsoun)
PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON LUCA.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.490
I'LL TAKE IT OUT
ON WHOEVER I THINK

18:10.523 --> 18:11.724
WILL IRRITATE YOU THE MOST.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.127
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
SOMEONE WHO USES THEIR WORK

18:14.161 --> 18:15.295
TO DEAL WITH PAIN.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.729
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT SEARCH ENGINES

18:16.763 --> 18:17.830
COULD LOOK WITHIN THE SOUL.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.432
YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF ME
IN A HOSPITAL GOWN.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.300
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THE POINT OF THIS?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.669
WHAT PERSONAL TRAUMA
ARE YOU EXPLOITING--

18:22.702 --> 18:25.705
SORRY--MINING
FOR ITS ARTISTIC POTENTIAL?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.874
MY ILLNESS.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.379
I DID THE BLOOD DOPING
TO INTRIGUE YOU,

18:32.412 --> 18:35.315
BUT I WAS ALREADY ILL.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.449
WAIT.
YOU'RE REALLY SICK?

18:36.483 --> 18:39.319
WHY ME?

18:39.352 --> 18:40.353
(Luca)
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE?
YES.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.721
SO TELL HIM.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.556
IF I DO, THERE WON'T BE
ANY GAME FOR HIM,

18:43.590 --> 18:46.193
AND THEN THERE WON'T BE
ANY ART FOR US.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.529
WHY ME?

18:49.562 --> 18:52.332
I DON'T ANSWER
THOSE QUESTIONS.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.169
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A LOT OF GAMES

18:56.203 --> 18:57.804
I COULD PLAY
THAT DON'T INVOLVE DEALING

18:57.837 --> 18:59.839
WITH NARCISSISTIC,
MANIPULATIVE POSEURS.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.310
BUT THIS IS A PUZZLE
TAILOR-MADE FOR YOU.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.646
YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH
OF MY SYMPTOMS ARE REAL,

19:06.679 --> 19:07.947
WHICH ARE FAKE,

19:07.980 --> 19:10.417
WHICH ONES I'M NOT EVEN
TELLING YOU ABOUT.

19:10.450 --> 19:15.322
I KNOW THAT
INTRIGUES YOU.

19:15.355 --> 19:20.427
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO END IT NOW?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.233
NO.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.235
YOU WANT US TO WASTE A BED
ON HER?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.369
YOU TOOK AN OATH...

19:29.402 --> 19:31.771
AN OATH TO BE COOL.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.607
AT LEAST THAT WAS THE ONE
I MUMBLED UNDER MY BREATH

19:34.641 --> 19:36.376
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE
WAS DOING THE BORING ONE.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.778
EVEN IF SHE IS SICK,
WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE,

19:38.811 --> 19:40.713
SHE ALSO SAYS
SHE HAS A DIAGNOSIS.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.750
SO IT'S EITHER JUST A LIE,
OR IT'S JUST A GAME.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.318
SO WHAT?

19:45.352 --> 19:47.620
I LIKE THE GAME. IT'S FUN.
GO GET A BLOOD CULTURE.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.323
CHECK FOR PARASITES
AND BACTERIA.
(Foreman)
THIS IS THE NEW HOUSE--

19:50.357 --> 19:53.326
HALF THE LEG POWER,
TWICE THE IRRESPONSIBILITY?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.428
THE NEW HOUSE IS ABOUT MAKING
MY LIFE HEALTHIER.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.230
NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT YOURS.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.266
GO GET HER BLOOD.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.472
I'LL DO IT.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.974
HE'S GOING THROUGH
A TOUGH PATCH RIGHT NOW.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.376
IF THIS IS THE DISTRACTION
HE NEEDS

20:09.409 --> 20:10.977
TO KEEP HIM
IN HIS HOSPITAL BED,

20:11.010 --> 20:13.546
I'M SURE IT'S BETTER
THAN ANY OF THE ALTERNATIVES.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.549
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY
CONDESCENDING.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.917
DID IT WORK?

20:24.857 --> 20:27.894
* IF YOU LIKE PIÑA COLADAS

20:27.927 --> 20:31.631
WHY DO YOU KEEP DUCKING
YOUR WIFE'S CALLS?

20:31.664 --> 20:32.565
EX-WIFE.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.601
I'M SURE SHE JUST WANTS
TO CONGRATULATE YOU

20:34.634 --> 20:37.437
ABOUT KNOCKING UP
A 22-YEAR-OLD NURSE.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.839
I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.542
BUT YOU HAVE TOLD HER
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SLEEP

20:42.575 --> 20:45.412
WITH HER ANYMORE, RIGHT?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.880
[scoffs] HOW ARE YOU PLANNING
ON LETTING HER KNOW?

20:47.914 --> 20:50.317
JUST INVITE HER
TO THE BRIS?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.419
I'M TRYING
TO LET HER DOWN EASY.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.553
RACHEL NEVER WANTED
TO HAVE KIDS.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.355
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.457
YEAH.
YOU ARE ALL ABOUT FEELINGS.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.427
I'VE LOVED RACHEL
FOR 20 YEARS.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.795
WHAT IF SHE NEVER SPEAKS
TO ME AGAIN?

21:02.829 --> 21:05.432
SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.367
IT BETTER BE FROM YOU.
[elevator bell dings]

21:07.400 --> 21:10.337
YOU CAN'T CHEAT YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS ONE.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.909
[whimpers]
WHAT IS IT?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.446
OH, JUST THE NAUSEA.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.013
SHE SAID HER BACK
WAS HURTING EARLIER.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.082
WHAT'S THE PAIN LEVEL
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.050
FIVE.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.486
HOW DO WE KNOW
WE CAN TAKE HER WORD FOR IT?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.387
WE CAN'T.
FUN, HUH?

21:27.420 --> 21:28.988
ROLL ON YOUR SIDE.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.894
GREY TURNER'S SIGN.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.396
WE'RE DONE PLAYING.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.598
YOUR PANCREAS IS RELEASING
CORROSIVE ENZYMES.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.400
IT'LL EAT AWAY
AT THE SURROUNDING ORGANS.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.602
BUT YOU MUST KNOW THAT.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.338
THE DOCTOR WHO DIAGNOSED YOU
WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT WILL HAPPEN

21:45.372 --> 21:47.407
IF YOU DON'T GET TREATMENT.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.443
JUST TELL THEM.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.011
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,

21:52.044 --> 21:53.546
TELL THEM
SO THEY CAN FIX IT.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.383
HOW MANY PROJECTS
HAVE WE DONE TOGETHER?

21:56.416 --> 21:57.984
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO WORRIED.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.520
HAVE YOU EVER GONE WRONG
TRUSTING ME?

22:10.096 --> 22:12.499
THAT PANCREATIC CYST
WE DRAINED--

22:12.532 --> 22:15.001
IT'S BACK,
AND SHE DOESN'T CARE AT ALL.

22:15.034 --> 22:19.406
YOU THINK
SHE ACTUALLY IS SUICIDAL.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.374
I WOULD, BUT HOW DID
SHE GIVE HERSELF THE CYSTS?

22:21.408 --> 22:23.042
TOX SCREEN WAS NEGATIVE,

22:23.075 --> 22:25.077
AND THERE'S NO SIGN
OF TRAUMA.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.917
THERE IS
ANOTHER EXPLANATION.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.719
THE REASON
SHE DIDN'T REACT

22:32.752 --> 22:35.722
ISN'T 'CAUSE
SHE WANTS TO DIE.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.726
IT'S 'CAUSE SHE KNOWS
SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.963
WHATEVER SHE HAS IS FATAL.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.667
THAT SHOULD NARROW IT DOWN.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.673
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.608
TESTING A THEORY.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.578
IT'S BASED ON SOME STUFF
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND,

22:58.611 --> 22:59.979
LIKE R.R. VARIABILITY,

23:00.012 --> 23:01.848
AND SOME STUFF YOU CAN,

23:01.881 --> 23:04.016
LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE SHAVED
HER HEAD IN AN ART PIECE

23:04.050 --> 23:05.184
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.754
THAT WAS A COMMENTARY
ON SOCIETY'S--

23:07.787 --> 23:09.121
IT WAS A COMMENTARY
ON THE FACT

23:09.155 --> 23:10.823
THAT IT WAS GONNA FALL OUT
ANYWAY,

23:10.857 --> 23:13.626
AND SHE WANTED
TO HIDE WHY.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.129
CANCER?

23:17.163 --> 23:19.866
ARE--ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

23:19.899 --> 23:25.037
SEE THAT TUMOR-ISH THINGAMAJIG
NEAR HER "BRAINAMABOB"?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.707
[softly]
OH, GOD.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.443
(House)
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?

23:30.477 --> 23:31.744
GAME'S OVER.
I WON.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.713
PRIMARY C.N.S. LYMPHOMA

23:33.746 --> 23:35.615
WITH ASSOCIATED
PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.851
IS THAT REALLY WHAT IT IS?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.054
YES.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.791
FOUR MONTHS AGO,

23:44.824 --> 23:48.661
I HAD SOME VISION
AND BALANCE PROBLEMS,

23:48.695 --> 23:50.497
AND NEW YORK MERCY
DIAGNOSED ME.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.600
THE TUMOR WAS TOO CLOSE
TO THE BRAIN STEM TO CUT OUT,

23:53.633 --> 23:56.636
SO THEY DID A FEW ROUNDS
OF RADIATION.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.171
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK,
AND THEY SENT ME HOME.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.508
THAT WAS AROUND THE TIME
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.809
WE WERE HAVING A FLING.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.977
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAIR
TO INVOLVE YOU.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.746
I'M INVOLVED NOW.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.048
YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO OPEN UP.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.618
LUCA, MY MIND
WAS NOT CLEAR THEN.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.054
AND THEN YOU CLEARED IT.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.490
THEN YOU REALIZED
YOU COULD USE YOUR DEATH

24:17.524 --> 24:18.891
TO MAKE YOUR MAGNUM OPUS.

24:18.925 --> 24:22.495
MAYBE YOU WANTED TO SHOW
THAT NO ONE CAN CHEAT DEATH,

24:22.529 --> 24:25.932
EVEN AN ENTIRE TEAM OF DOCTORS
WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.501
OR MAYBE YOUR FIRST DOCTORS

24:28.535 --> 24:31.504
DIDN'T TREAT YOU LIKE A PERSON--
JUST A SERIES OF SYMPTOMS.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.940
YOU WANTED TO RE-CREATE
THAT DEPERSONALIZATION.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.775
AND I WAS THE MAN TO SEE.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.880
IF THAT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT,

24:40.913 --> 24:43.516
I DON'T ANY LONGER.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.586
YOU SPENT TIME WITH ME.

24:46.619 --> 24:50.022
YOU TOOK THIS PERSONALLY.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.726
NO, I DIDN'T.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.064
AND I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK
YOUR PIECE IS ABOUT ANYTHING.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.299
I THINK YOU JUST FIGURED OUT
THAT YOU'RE MORTAL.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.869
YOU'RE JUST A BAG OF CELLS
AND WASTE

25:02.902 --> 25:04.737
WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.940
YOU WANTED TO ACT OUT.
YOU WANTED PEOPLE TO NOTICE.

25:10.610 --> 25:14.614
MAYBE YOU EVEN PRAYED FOR
A DIFFERENT ANSWER THIS TIME.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.922
I GOT A TITLE
FOR YOUR PIECE--

25:22.955 --> 25:26.626
"IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING."

25:38.605 --> 25:41.240
YOU'RE FORGING MY NAME
ON PRESCRIPTIONS AGAIN.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.776
NO.

25:43.810 --> 25:47.213
WHAT YOU JUST SAID IMPLIES
THAT I STOPPED AT SOME POINT.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.414
20 MINUTES AGO,
I PUT A NOTICE OUT

25:48.447 --> 25:51.017
TO ALL LOCAL PHARMACIES
TO REQUIRE VERBAL AUTHORIZATION

25:51.050 --> 25:52.919
BEFORE FILLING
MY PRESCRIPTIONS.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.854
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH EXTRA
WORK YOU'VE JUST GIVEN YOURSELF?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.022
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LAST A WEEK.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.957
I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH THIS FOR YEARS.

25:57.990 --> 25:58.991
BUT IT'S OVER--

25:59.025 --> 26:01.761
YOUR LIVER,
YOUR HEARING,

26:01.794 --> 26:03.596
NEVER MIND THE FACT
THAT EACH SCRIP YOU WRITE

26:03.630 --> 26:04.864
IS A SEPARATE FELONY.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.733
YOU WILL SERVE TIME,
SO COULD I.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.967
YOU'VE CHOSEN THIS MOMENT

26:08.000 --> 26:09.769
TO GIVE ME CRAP
ABOUT MY VICODIN USE?

26:09.802 --> 26:11.237
YOU FILLED THIS
THREE DAYS AGO.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.338
NOW IT'S ALMOST HALF GONE.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.606
SO IS MY LEG.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.274
IT'S A MONTH SUPPLY.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.644
THE AMOUNT YOU'RE TAKING
HAS NOTHING TO DO

26:17.677 --> 26:19.245
WITH PHYSICAL PAIN.
OKAY.

26:19.278 --> 26:22.849
SO MAYBE I AM TRYING TO NUMB
MYSELF A LITTLE,

26:22.882 --> 26:25.785
BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO CHANGE,

26:25.818 --> 26:27.987
TRYING TO STOP
BEING SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.289
SO YOU CAN ONLY HANDLE
NOT SELF-DESTRUCTING

26:30.322 --> 26:31.758
BY BEING SELF-DESTRUCTIVE?

26:31.791 --> 26:34.761
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
I DON'T KNOW, HOUSE,
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.295
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I CAN WATCH YOU

26:36.328 --> 26:37.830
CUT OFF PIECES OF YOURSELF.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.899
NOW IT'S THE I.C.U.
NEXT TIME IT'LL BE THE MORGUE.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.669
YOU'RE MISERABLE.

26:42.702 --> 26:43.936
AND YOU'RE ANGRY.

26:43.970 --> 26:47.206
AND I WANT YOU
TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THAT

26:47.239 --> 26:50.810
AND NOT JUST TRY TO MEDICATE
THE ISSUE AWAY.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.847
NO.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.983
YOU KNOW
WHAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW?

26:57.016 --> 26:59.852
I DON'T FEEL MISERABLE
OR ANGRY.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.789
I DON'T FEEL GOOD
OR BAD.

27:02.822 --> 27:06.192
I FEEL NOTHING...

27:06.225 --> 27:09.962
WHICH FEELS GREAT.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.130
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:11.163 --> 27:12.364
MOVING ON...

27:12.398 --> 27:15.935
IN THE DIRECTION OF MY HOUSE,
WHERE I GOT SOME MORE PILLS.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.908
IF YOU'RE DISCHARGING YOURSELF
AGAINST DOCTOR'S ORDERS,

27:21.941 --> 27:23.710
YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK
THAT BOX.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.011
I'M A DOCTOR.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.779
SO, TECHNICALLY--

27:26.813 --> 27:29.181
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
IF YOU JUST CHECKED THE BOX?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.237
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.105
I'M GOING AS SOON
AS THE NURSE BRINGS ME

27:53.139 --> 27:54.974
SOMETHING FOR MY ECZEMA.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.816
I FIGURED IT WAS IRRITATED
BY THE PAINT THINNER

28:03.850 --> 28:04.917
POURED ON ME
IN THE GALLERY.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.819
DOES THIS MEAN SOMETHING?

28:06.853 --> 28:09.088
IT'S NOT ECZEMA.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.692
AND IT'S NOT CANCER.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.897
(Chase)
IT'S WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.966
BIOPSY CONFIRMED
THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS ECZEMA

28:19.999 --> 28:21.734
WAS ACTUALLY A SWELLING
OF THE BLOOD VESSELS

28:21.768 --> 28:22.935
IN YOUR SKIN.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.271
IT ALSO EXPLAINS
THE PANCREATITIS

28:25.304 --> 28:27.439
AND THE MASS IN YOUR BRAIN.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.442
AND IT'S TREATABLE.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.845
UM...

28:32.879 --> 28:35.114
WHAT'S THE TREATMENT?

28:35.147 --> 28:36.282
WE COULD DO STEROIDS ALONE

28:36.315 --> 28:37.950
TO SHRINK THE GROWTH
IN YOUR BRAIN,

28:37.984 --> 28:40.452
BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER TO ADD
ANOTHER COURSE OF RADIATION.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.088
RADIATION?

28:42.121 --> 28:44.924
ON MY BRAIN?

28:44.957 --> 28:46.893
BUT IT MADE ME FUZZY
LAST TIME.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.494
IT WAS HARDER TO WORK.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.030
I AM STILL SLOWED DOWN
FROM IT.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.033
AND IT'LL GET WORSE.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.869
BUT, YOU KNOW,
DYING CAN ALSO DO A NUMBER

28:56.903 --> 28:58.304
ON YOUR ABILITY TO THINK.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.742
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO THE RADIATION.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.483
THEY JUST SAID
IT WAS A BETTER TREATMENT.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.787
IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.

29:14.821 --> 29:18.124
MY LIFE'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING
IF I CAN'T DO MY ART.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.526
(Luca)
YOU HAVE FRIENDS,

29:20.559 --> 29:24.063
PEOPLE WHO CARE
ABOUT YOU.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.466
THIS IS MY BRAIN,
MY WORK,

29:27.499 --> 29:29.101
AND MY LIFE, LUCA.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.270
YOU HAVE MORE.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.105
THIS IS NOT

29:33.139 --> 29:36.976
SOME GREAT PERFORMANCE
PIECE ANYMORE.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.247
THIS IS JUST CRAZY.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.852
I'M SORRY.

29:50.422 --> 29:54.560
I CAN'T WATCH YOU DIE...

29:54.593 --> 29:57.496
NOT WHEN YOU
CAN SAVE YOURSELF.

29:59.866 --> 30:02.935
GOOD-BYE, AFSOUN.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.972
[monitor beeping]

30:15.915 --> 30:18.517
GOOD FOR YOU.

30:31.630 --> 30:34.233
SO.
SO.

30:36.936 --> 30:40.439
WHY DID I EVER BAN ALCOHOL
FROM THE CAFETERIA?

30:44.376 --> 30:46.378
BEFORE I FORGET,
THERE'S A BRUSH.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.948
TORTOISE-SHELL HANDLE,
NATURAL BRISTLES--

30:48.981 --> 30:50.649
WASN'T IN THE BOX.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.618
IF YOU COULD LOOK FOR IT...

30:52.651 --> 30:56.255
LIKE THE LINDBERGH BABY.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.925
YOU DATING ANYONE?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.092
WE DON'T HAVE TO--

31:00.126 --> 31:03.462
LOOK, IT'S JUST
STANDARD LUNCH CONVERSATION.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.998
NOT FOR US.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.666
OKAY, WELL,
IF YOU'VE GONE OVER

31:07.699 --> 31:09.969
TO THE "WE DON'T TALK
ABOUT THINGS" SIDE,

31:10.002 --> 31:12.038
THEN I'VE GOT A POT ROAST
IN THE OVEN.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.940
NO.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.208
I HAVEN'T DATED ANYONE
SINCE YOU.

31:18.444 --> 31:21.880
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
ONCE YOU GO GIMP...

31:24.050 --> 31:27.920
WE S-SHOULD TALK
ABOUT YOUR LEG.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.589
YOU THINK I HAVE
UNRESOLVED ISSUES,

31:30.622 --> 31:32.624
AND YOU ARE
THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.927
YES.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.930
BUT IT'S--IT'S--
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.531
IT'S YOUR LIFE,
YOUR CHOICES.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.400
I DID IT
TO FIX MY LIFE.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.335
NO, WAIT.

31:43.369 --> 31:47.606
NO, I DID IT BECAUSE
I'M A DEEPLY UNHAPPY PERSON.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.476
NO--NO, I DID IT
TO GET SYMPATHY FROM YOU.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.278
I DID IT TO PISS YOU OFF.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.946
I DID IT
BECAUSE I'M NOT OVER YOU.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.182
OR I WAS OVER YOU,
AND I WAS MOVING ON.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.384
I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED
TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

31:58.417 --> 31:59.651
NOT TO BE IN PAIN.

31:59.685 --> 32:04.090
I DID IT BECAUSE I WANT
TO FEEL MORE PAIN.

32:08.727 --> 32:12.098
WHATEVER THE REASON, IT WAS
A BAD REASON AND A BAD IDEA.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.699
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.135
GOOD LUNCH.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.475
HOUSE...

32:23.509 --> 32:25.011
TALK TO ME!

32:25.044 --> 32:25.677
I ALREADY DID.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.679
NO, YOU JUST PARROTED BACK

32:27.713 --> 32:29.681
WHAT WILSON AND I'VE BEEN SAYING
TO YOU THE LAST FEW DAYS.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.650
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
NO.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.719
OH, YOU PULLED A STITCH.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.054
HOUSE, PLEASE
JUST TALK TO ME.

32:35.087 --> 32:38.024
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I FEEL?

32:43.729 --> 32:46.598
I FEEL HURT.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.044
I KNOW.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.351
I'M SORRY.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.191
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

33:24.803 --> 33:28.474
DID I MAKE
THE WRONG CHOICE?

33:31.810 --> 33:33.779
FIVE YEARS,

33:33.812 --> 33:36.748
THROUGH EVERY OPENING,
EVERY INSTALLATION,

33:36.782 --> 33:38.617
EVERY DAY
AND EVERY NIGHT,

33:38.650 --> 33:40.786
HE WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

33:40.819 --> 33:44.490
EXCEPT THE FIRST TIME
YOU WERE DIAGNOSED.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.658
YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM,

33:46.692 --> 33:50.096
AND YOU HAD TO GO
THROUGH ALL OF THAT ALONE.

33:50.129 --> 33:54.266
MAYBE THAT'S THE REAL REASON
YOU'RE DOING THIS PIECE--

33:54.300 --> 33:58.470
SO THAT THIS TIME
YOU CAN HAVE HIM WITH YOU.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.173
YOU STILL COULD.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.786
HI.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.555
UH, LISA CUDDY.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.789
NICE TO MEET YOU.

34:17.823 --> 34:18.924
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.

34:18.957 --> 34:22.428
I--THERE WERE SOME PERSONAL
THINGS GOING ON IN MY LIFE,

34:22.461 --> 34:24.830
AND I WASN'T AT MY BEST.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.765
WELL, IN RETROSPECT,

34:26.798 --> 34:29.735
MY APPROACH COULD'VE COME OFF
AS A LITTLE CREEPY.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.370
NO.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.772
ON A SCALE FROM ONE
TO CREEPY,

34:33.805 --> 34:36.275
YOU WERE
MAYBE MILDLY UNNERVING.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.647
(woman over PA)
PAGING DR. STATEMAN.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.115
DR. STATEMAN, PLEASE.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.358
RACHE.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.293
SORRY I DUCKED YOUR CALLS.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.129
I KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES,
BUT AT SOME POINT--

34:57.163 --> 34:59.531
CHRIS...
I'M PREGNANT.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.305
I...

35:06.338 --> 35:09.608
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.648
SORRY.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.584
JUST CHECKING THE STITCHES
ON MY PENIS.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.819
YOUR LEG OKAY?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.721
IT'S HEALING.
GOOD.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.890
JUST CAME TO GRAB
THE RADIATION-THERAPY FORMS.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.892
WHAT?

35:26.925 --> 35:30.296
AFSOUN CHANGED HER MIND.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.733
[door slides open]

35:34.766 --> 35:36.635
GET OUT.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.245
YOU MADE A DECISION.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.914
I CHANGED MY MIND.
WHY?

35:48.947 --> 35:51.783
BECAUSE THERE
ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THAN--

35:51.817 --> 35:53.252
THAN WHAT--
THAN YOUR BRAIN,

35:53.285 --> 35:55.221
YOUR ABILITIES?

35:55.254 --> 35:56.822
IT'S WHERE
EVERYTHING COMES FROM--

35:56.855 --> 35:58.757
ANY MEANING IN YOUR LIFE,
ANY HAPPINESS.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.426
NOT ALL HAPPINESS--

36:00.459 --> 36:02.894
HE'S ALREADY LEFT ONCE.
HE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.463
YOU DON'T NEED TO DEPEND
ON PEOPLE

36:04.496 --> 36:07.699
WHO ARE GONNA LET YOU DOWN.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.769
IF YOU DO THIS,
YOU'RE A PATHETIC HYPOCRITE.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.938
YOUR WHOLE LIFE, ALL YOUR WORK
YOU'RE SAYING THAT

36:12.971 --> 36:16.342
UP UNTIL HIM
WAS A POINTLESS--
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

36:29.688 --> 36:32.424
[door slides open]

36:56.515 --> 36:58.617
[knock at door]

36:58.650 --> 37:01.653
[pills rattling]

37:03.555 --> 37:06.558
[cell phone ringing]

37:09.961 --> 37:14.266
(Wilson)
HOUSE, I CAN HEAR
YOUR PHONE RINGING.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.888
[sighs]
YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:36.922 --> 37:38.690
YOU GO TO LUNCH
WITH CUDDY?

37:38.724 --> 37:40.058
YEAH.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.927
HOW WAS IT?

37:43.629 --> 37:47.933
THE PASTA ARRABBIATA
WAS COLD.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.902
WHY DON'T WE GET A DRINK?

37:50.936 --> 37:54.005
WE COULD GO
TO THE SAWMILL.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.723
CUDDY'S IS ON THE WAY.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.993
I NEED TO RETURN THIS.

38:15.026 --> 38:18.063
YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
AN EMERGENCY TANGLE?

38:18.096 --> 38:20.399
IT WAS ON MY MIND.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.368
I WANT TO GET IT OFF.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.444
WANT ME TO COME?

38:32.478 --> 38:35.046
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE?

38:35.080 --> 38:37.749
I'M DELIVERING
A HAIRBRUSH.

39:06.077 --> 39:09.781
[indistinct chatter]

39:42.681 --> 39:44.015
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

39:44.049 --> 39:46.952
GET OUT.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.855
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.557
GET OUT.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.731
HOUSE,
WHAT ARE YOU MAD ABOUT?

39:59.765 --> 40:03.101
JUST LET IT OUT.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.155
[tires squealing]

40:34.533 --> 40:36.134
[tires squealing]

40:41.006 --> 40:43.975
[tires squealing]

40:44.009 --> 40:45.977
AAH!

41:41.933 --> 41:44.936
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.754
YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE?

42:04.790 --> 42:08.059
NO, I THINK
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

42:08.093 --> 42:11.096
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO TODAY?

42:11.129 --> 42:13.198
I DON'T KNOW.
GO HOME?

42:16.067 --> 42:18.737
NOT TONIGHT.

42:18.770 --> 42:20.338
CHEERS.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.107
* WHEN I'M WITH YOU

42:22.140 --> 42:25.343
* ALL MY BROTHERS, OH

42:25.376 --> 42:29.080
* I FEEL LIKE A KING

42:29.114 --> 42:33.351
* IT FEELS LIKE I'M DREAMING

42:33.384 --> 42:38.990
* WHEN THAT BLOOD GOES RATTLING
THROUGH MY VEINS *

42:39.024 --> 42:42.594
* MY EARS START TO RING

42:42.628 --> 42:44.596
* I NOTICE WHAT MATTERS

42:44.630 --> 42:48.634
* AND I GOT NOTHING
TO LOSE BUT *

42:48.667 --> 42:52.337
* DARKNESS
AND SHADOWS *

42:52.370 --> 42:55.073
* GOT NOTHING
TO LOSE BUT *

42:55.106 --> 43:00.111
* BITTERNESS AND PATTERNS

43:00.145 --> 43:02.080
* OH

43:02.113 --> 43:10.088
*
