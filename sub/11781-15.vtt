WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.443
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.548
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.550
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.584 --> 00:19.320
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.455
I found out that
Jeremy was the mole.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.425
He was the one giving
our designs to Beau,
not India.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.595
Rita Shaw told me
that you're single.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.264
Ben Quimby is mine,
so back off.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.166
You had your chance.
It's my turn now.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.636
I really like
the idea of "us".

00:37.538 --> 00:39.207
Why did you
leave us, Mom?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.808
BEN: She's gonna be
all fun and charming

00:40.841 --> 00:43.177
and then she's
just gonna leave.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.113
And I don't want her
to hurt Jane.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.249
If you give me
this opportunity,
I will not let you down.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.251
I would like you to stay.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.233
Oh, Jane!
There you are.
You've met Christian?

01:05.266 --> 01:07.635
Uh, no, I haven't,
but I'm a huge fan.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.271
Aw, thank you, though,
nice meeting you.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.206
Well, I need to
get back to the office.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.374
It was really nice
to see you.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.543
Nice to see you, too,
looking gorgeous,
as always.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.611
You're sweet.
And Jane.

01:17.645 --> 01:21.215
When you get in,
we need to talk
about the other night.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.685
That was close.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.255
I've been here
for the last 10 minutes
distracting her

01:27.288 --> 01:28.622
I'm sorry, what?

01:28.656 --> 01:29.690
Um, look.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.597
This is bad.
Very, very bad.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.704
Just put away
all these...

01:47.341 --> 01:50.144
This is terrible.
Beau is engaged.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.246
Oh, I don't know.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.582
If you ask me,
I think they could be happy.

01:54.615 --> 01:58.652
Yeah, in a twisted
father-daughter kind of way.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.621
Do you thiNo.she knows?

02:00.654 --> 02:01.522
I saw her smiling
this morning.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.891
This news would be
devastating to Gray.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.560
I'llBOTH: No!her.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.330
Well, someone
has to tell her that her
ex-husband's engaged.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.232
GRAY: Jane!

02:11.965 --> 02:13.501
Hmm. Lucky you.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.370
GRAY: Get in here.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.707
Yes, Gray?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.309
I heard you all out there.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.610
What were you
talking about?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.579
Don't play games
with me, Jane.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.348
I know it's
all over town.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.649
It is?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.951
I'm so sorry, Gray.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.521
What is he thinking?
She's, like, so young.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.688
What are you
talking about?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.624
What are you
talking about?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.527
I'm talking about Jeremy
stabbing me in the back.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.729
I'm sure everyone
in the fashion business
knows by now.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.965
I can't even bring myself
to look at the Internet
or the papers.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.569
Yes, you should not
look at any of that stuff.

02:48.602 --> 02:53.207
So, tell me, Jane,
how long did you know
that Jeremy was the mole

02:53.241 --> 02:54.642
before you told me?

02:55.343 --> 02:57.645
Only a day.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.713
One dI know.long.

02:59.747 --> 03:03.617
I was just
shocked and upset

03:03.651 --> 03:06.620
and the truth is,
I didn't know
how to tell you.

03:06.654 --> 03:10.791
In the future, Jane,
I need you to be
honest with me

03:11.459 --> 03:13.227
about everything.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.795
I will, I promise.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.301
Actually, there is
one more thing.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.305
Do you think she told her?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.710
I'm gonna say yes.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.651
* I've my heart where
my head should be

03:37.685 --> 03:40.788
* Light up the rest of me

03:40.821 --> 03:44.392
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

03:44.425 --> 03:46.627
* Through the stops,
the starts

03:46.660 --> 03:48.829
* And life is a work of art

03:56.837 --> 03:59.773
Gray really did a number
on this cell phone,
didn't she?

03:59.807 --> 04:02.676
Tell me about it.
I have to get her
a new one.

04:02.710 --> 04:06.714
And I'm thinking
that a few backups
might not be a bad idea

04:06.747 --> 04:08.716
until Beau's
wedding passes.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.684
You know, if you're busy,
I could do that for you.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.587
I'm already going to be
running out to get
new toothbrushes.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.289
New toothbrushes?

04:15.323 --> 04:18.392
The bristles
you and Ben use
are too hard.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.462
You're removing plaque,
not stucco.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.431
You touched
my bristles?

04:23.464 --> 04:26.734
Ben, relax.
Mom's probably right.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.702
But I like
my toothbrush.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.305
He's just afraid that
you're not going to be
able to find another one

04:31.339 --> 04:32.540
with a picture
of Batman on it.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.511
That was a little sassy.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.812
I'm sorry.

04:38.846 --> 04:42.850
No, please.
Never apologize
for quality sass.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.851
It's a gift.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.456
The more
I think about it,

04:48.489 --> 04:49.857
a cell phone is not
what Gray needs.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.726
What she needs is
to get back out there.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.763
On the market.
BacFor a man.e?

04:55.796 --> 04:58.732
Trust me. Gray and I
are very similar.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.801
We're women of the world.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.404
We're much more
than just our beauty.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.873
Do you know what
online dating site
she uses?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.508
Online dating?

05:07.541 --> 05:10.511
Um, that doesn't seem
like Gray somehow.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.480
It's how I met Dakota.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.681
Dakota?

05:13.714 --> 05:16.684
My boyfriend.
Well, ex-boyfriend.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.619
Sort of?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.887
It's complicated.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.922
It usually is
with you, right?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.626
Well, I better be going.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.561
Oh, don't forget
parent-teacher conferences
are this week.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.530
I know.
I'm parenting and teachering.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.633
But just so we're clear,
it's a Spider-Man toothbrush,
not Batman.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.805
I think he's
warming up to me.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.646
Hey, so, I was thinking
maybe we could
hang out tomorrow.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.382
That is,
if you don't have any
other plans, of course.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.784
Hmm. You and me?
Plans on a Saturday?

05:50.818 --> 05:51.885
You sure you're
ready for that?

05:51.919 --> 05:55.155
I'm serious.
How's 5:00 p.m.?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.690
PGreat..

05:57.458 --> 05:58.826
Barbecue at my house.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.929
At your house with...

06:01.962 --> 06:03.931
My parents.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.533
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.801
Oh, come on,
don't be such a chicken.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.170
They're harmless.
And they really
want to meet you.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.906
That's nice. It is.
It's just...

06:13.774 --> 06:15.643
Please? For me?

06:15.676 --> 06:16.910
(SIGHS)

06:16.944 --> 06:18.412
5:00.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.913
Don't be late.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.817
Okay, okay, people!
The time has arrived.

06:23.851 --> 06:28.522
Signups for
the school play
have finally begun.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.527
Whoa, what're you doing?

06:33.561 --> 06:34.962
What does it look
like I'm doing?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.897
The school play?
Are you serious?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.699
Deadly. Why?
Is that a problem?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.901
Oh, no, I just...
I guess I didn't

06:40.934 --> 06:43.871
peg you for the
dramatic arts type,
that's all.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.006
Well, there's a lot
you don't know about
me yet, Billy Nutter.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.976
Saturday, 5:00,
don't forget.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.521
Hey.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.889
Why so serious?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.957
Zoe wants me to
meet her parents.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.627
Not helping, Jane.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.995
I'm sorry, I...

07:08.028 --> 07:11.499
Yeah, yeah,
you don't like Zoe.
I get it.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.000
Come on, Billy.
That's not true.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.868
It just feels like...

07:14.902 --> 07:16.537
Like I'm what?

07:16.570 --> 07:17.938
Like you're replacing me?

07:18.972 --> 07:19.907
You're being crazy.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.775
Am I?

07:23.644 --> 07:26.880
You know what? It's fine.
Forget I said anything.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.816
You've moved on.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.985
From Lulu and that's
a good thing.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.253
Janey...

07:33.286 --> 07:35.656
No, really, it's fine.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.935
Hello, ticket sales.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.503
Nick Fadden, right?

07:49.537 --> 07:50.804
Yeah.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.040
I'm so sorry
to hear about that arm.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.975
Ooh! Total bummer.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.276
Thanks.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.511
You know
the saying, though.

07:57.545 --> 08:01.782
When life hands you lemons,
audition for Prince Charming.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.951
Yeah, I don't think
that's how the saying goes.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.919
(CHUCKLES) Well, it should.

08:05.953 --> 08:09.923
Listen, Nick, you have
star quality, okay?

08:09.957 --> 08:11.258
I have an eye for this.

08:11.291 --> 08:15.262
Do yourself a favor
and don't let that
potential go to waste.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.898
I don't know.
Just think it over.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.548
(GASPS) Ben!
There you are.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.651
Hey, Amanda.
Heard about the play
sign-ups. Exciting stuff.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.020
Oh, yeah, well,
I'm just trying
to do my part,

08:40.053 --> 08:41.989
you know, give back.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.826
Speaking of giving back,

08:45.859 --> 08:49.029
I was thinking
maybe this weekend
you and I could...

08:49.062 --> 08:51.799
Oh, no, she did not.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.541
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

09:04.912 --> 09:05.979
(EXCLAIMS)

09:07.114 --> 09:08.148
Oh!

09:13.153 --> 09:14.554
GIRL: Sorry.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.692
Oh my God, Rita.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.994
What's going on?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.162
Nothing. I just...

09:23.063 --> 09:24.765
I just have to go.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.880
Hey, are you okay?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.149
I'm fine.
Really, I'm...

09:43.751 --> 09:45.753
Not fine.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.156
It's Ben.
He's over me.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.993
Over you?
Aren't you the one
that broke up with him?

09:53.026 --> 09:55.929
I think I made a mistake.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.166
Well, then, tell him you
want to get back together.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.136
It's not that simple, Jane.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.106
Things...
Things have changed.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.942
You mean Miss Clark?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.044
I can't compete
with Amanda.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.813
I never could
and I never will.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.783
(CHUCKLES) That's crazy.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.951
You're not
in high school
anymore, Miss Shaw.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.155
And besides,
I know my brother.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.092
And he likes you
just the way you are.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.427
Which is more like this.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.131
(CHUCKLES) Just be yourself.
No one can compete with that.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.077
We saw the hallway debacle.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.212
It's already
gone viral.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.847
And we overheard
Jane's advice.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.082
Very, very bad.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.151
Equals staying single.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.920
Perhaps for an eternity.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.187
You want to win
Mr. Quimby back,

10:54.221 --> 10:55.889
you're gonna
have to step it up.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.791
Trust us.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.028
Girls, I appreciate
your concern

11:01.061 --> 11:02.696
but you should
get to class.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.733
Suit yourself, Miss Shaw.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.108
Hey, Mom.
Sorry I can't talk.
I'm late for work.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.010
And IDon't mind me.nge.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.245
Although I have good news,

11:18.278 --> 11:20.748
I just finished
Gray's online profile.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.216
I'm sorry, what?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.452
Isn't it exciting?

11:25.485 --> 11:28.989
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
What did you do?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.091
Well, you just seemed
so overwhelmed lately,
kiddo.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.126
I thought I'd take
something off your plate.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.862
Mom.
At no point was creating

11:34.895 --> 11:37.865
an online dating
profile for Gray
ever on my plate.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.868
"Easy-going
and affectionate, enjoys
long walks on the beach."

11:40.901 --> 11:42.135
Gray is none of those things.

11:42.169 --> 11:46.239
Well, in the
world of online dating,
illusion is everything.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.308
Trust me,
she'll thank me later.

11:53.781 --> 11:54.782
(SCOFFS)

12:02.255 --> 12:04.758
Welcome.
Welcome, you guys,

12:04.792 --> 12:07.895
to auditions for
Amanda Clark presents

12:07.928 --> 12:10.230
Cindy: A High School
Cinderella.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.804
Okay. I am Amanda Clark.

12:16.837 --> 12:21.174
You probably
recognize me from
film or television

12:21.208 --> 12:24.211
but I am so proud
to say that it is

12:24.244 --> 12:29.049
right here,
on this very stage,
that it all began.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.153
Actually, this stage
was put in after
we graduated. So...

12:35.288 --> 12:36.957
What I meant to say

12:36.990 --> 12:40.794
was that it all began
here at Whitemarsh.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.195
And who knows?
Who knows?

12:42.229 --> 12:45.565
One of you
might be the next
Amanda Clark.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.301
(CHUCKLING) Looking out
around this crowd,

12:48.335 --> 12:51.138
I see three...
Oh, well, maybe two

12:51.171 --> 12:54.207
potential Cindys
here today right now.

12:54.241 --> 12:58.078
But Miss Shaw insisted that
everyone deserves a chance.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.312
Right? (CHUCKLES)

12:59.346 --> 13:01.248
So, let's get
that part over with.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.916
Yup? Good luck!

13:04.852 --> 13:06.954
"They're not even
my real sisters.

13:06.987 --> 13:11.091
"All they want to do is
hold me down. They're evil."

13:11.124 --> 13:15.095
Seriously, why would I
ever put up with their crap?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.197
"They're not even
my real sisters.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.166
"All they want to do
is hold me down.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.601
"They're evil."

13:21.634 --> 13:24.004
You know,
what exactly is evil
about her sisters?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.072
I think
they're really funny.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.975
(SIGHS)

13:28.008 --> 13:29.977
"They're not even
my real sisters.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.879
"All they want to do
is hold me down.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.914
"They're evil.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.984
"And I feel trapped.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.051
"I just wish that
I could break free

13:38.085 --> 13:41.021
"so I can live the life
my father wanted for me."

13:53.166 --> 13:55.135
They look happy.
Don't you think?

13:55.168 --> 13:56.236
Who?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.338
The couple that just...
Never mind.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.242
Um, you know,
this is probably
none of my business,

14:02.275 --> 14:05.012
but have you ever
thought about getting
back out there?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.346
Out where?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.281
Out into the
world of dating?

14:08.315 --> 14:11.651
Oh. Jane.
This is my fault.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.888
I think I've been
too kind to you.

14:14.922 --> 14:18.325
I believe
I've given you the illusion
that you and I are friends.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.360
Oh. No. No, no, no...

14:20.393 --> 14:23.163
Let's be clear.
You sharpen my pencils.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.332
We don't do girl talk.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.433
Understood.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.235
Gray? Is that you?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.370
Oh, no.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.306
Tamara!
How are you?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.276
I'm fantastic.
But why have you
been avoiding my calls?

14:36.309 --> 14:40.347
Avoiding?
No, I must not have
gotten the messages. Jane?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.282
No, I gave you her...

14:42.315 --> 14:45.118
I... No, I didn't
give you those
messages.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.054
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.421
Don't let it happen again.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.090
Well, now that
I have you here,

14:50.123 --> 14:52.425
how am I going
to lure you over
to my new company?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.162
I'm flattered. I am.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.164
But I'm happy
where I am right now.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.298
At least listen
to my offer.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.300
You know you'd be
happier with us.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.936
Thank you, but if
Donovan were to know

15:02.970 --> 15:06.306
we were even here together,
I would be out of a job
by tonight.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.375
Well, if you change
your mind, you know
where to find me.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.245
(SIGHS)

15:17.517 --> 15:19.486
What's up?
So, how'd the audition go?

15:19.519 --> 15:22.089
It was good.
She asked a few
of us to stay.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.491
She wants to check
chemistry with the possible
Prince Charmings.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.226
Oh.

15:26.259 --> 15:30.197
So, before we
begin our auditions
for Prince Charming,

15:30.230 --> 15:34.101
I should tell you guys
that there is a kiss.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.503
And I know that
that might sound
a little bit intimidating

15:36.536 --> 15:38.305
for some of you people
right over here,

15:38.338 --> 15:42.042
but I assure you
it is just acting, okay?

15:45.178 --> 15:47.480
Hey, can we talk?

15:47.514 --> 15:50.450
Sure.
Is everything okay?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.219
You tell me.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.154
Lately, it seems
like you're

15:55.122 --> 15:57.190
upset about something.

15:57.224 --> 16:00.393
I'm fine now.
Thanks for asking.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.329
Well, I just wanted
to make sure.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.498
You look really nice,
by the way.

16:05.532 --> 16:10.370
Actually, I think
that it is only fair
that I demonstrate

16:10.403 --> 16:14.407
for you the difference
between acting and real life.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.410
So, uh, let's see here.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.779
Ben! Mr. Quimby.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.249
Would you join me
on stage, please?

16:22.282 --> 16:25.385
Uh-huh. Yes, you.
(CHUCKLES)

16:25.418 --> 16:26.986
Get up here.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.157
(CHUCKLING)

16:30.190 --> 16:34.294
So, a stage kiss
is only acting, right?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.330
So, just, you know,
shake off those
inhibitions.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.698
Come on. (CHUCKLES)

16:38.731 --> 16:42.502
And use your instrument
to just take hold of
that emotion, okay?

16:42.535 --> 16:45.138
It's kind of like this.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.506
(EXHALES)!

16:51.478 --> 16:54.381
(PANTING)
Thank you, Mr. Quimby.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.584
That was wonderful.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.519
You're welcome.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.454
AMANDA: And helpful.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.156
So...

17:06.226 --> 17:07.494
(Sorry.)

17:11.631 --> 17:13.433
Is that a dating website?

17:13.466 --> 17:14.501
No.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.070
Yes. Sort of.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.538
It's okay. I get it.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.806
Get what?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.474
I'm competing with others.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.077
And I want you
to know that I'm up
for the challenge.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.312
Good to know.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.413
This isn't for me.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.516
My mom created
an online dating
profile for Gray.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.084
Oh.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.519
You think
that's a good idea?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.786
No, of course not.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.323
Which is why
I'm trying to delete it
before Gray finds out.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.391
Finds out what?

17:38.425 --> 17:41.428
Nothing,
it's just this...

17:41.461 --> 17:44.464
Just, uh, Jane's mom
made an online dating
profile for Gray.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.103
That is a great idea.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.571
No, we need to shut it
down right now.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.274
GRAY: Jane!

17:54.307 --> 17:55.475
That was fast.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.316
Gray, I'm so sorry.
But maybe, you know,

18:03.350 --> 18:04.551
if you put yourself
out there again...

18:04.584 --> 18:07.120
Look at this!

18:10.157 --> 18:12.425
"Gray Chandler Murray
spotted with Tamara Mellon.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.295
"Is she jumping ship
at Donovan Decker?"

18:15.328 --> 18:17.397
Oh, yes.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.532
Donovan knows
Tamara's been trying
to get me over there

18:19.566 --> 18:21.501
ever since she left
Jimmy Choo.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.570
If Donovan sees this...

18:23.603 --> 18:25.272
Maybe he won't.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.706
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

18:29.309 --> 18:31.511
Gray Chandler
Murray's office.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.615
(WHISPERS)
It's Donovan.

18:44.524 --> 18:48.328
GRAY: Yes, Donovan,
I assure you it's nothing.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.231
Yes, Donovan,
I understand.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.499
Thank you.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.735
So, do we
still work here?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.604
Yes, Jane.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.606
I mean, you didn't
do anything wrong.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.608
You just ran into
Tamara on the street.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.611
It doesn't matter.
Perception is everything
in this business.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.579
If something like this
were to happen again,

19:06.613 --> 19:09.549
there'd be no
convincing Donovan
that it was an accident.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.751
That'll be all, Jane.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.492
Looks like Gray's
having a rough day.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.728
First Beau. Now this.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.496
What did you hear?

19:23.530 --> 19:26.466
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.304
Hello, is this
Tamara Mellon's office?

19:31.338 --> 19:34.541
Yes, this is Gray Chandler
Murray's assistant.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.476
Gray would love to set
a dinner with Tamara

19:36.509 --> 19:40.280
to discuss
their possible future.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.681
Saturday at 5:00
at the Boathouse?

19:41.714 --> 19:44.384
Perfect.
She'll be there.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.267
Eli. Check this out.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.470
I thought you were
gonna delete this.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.306
I was!
But then Gray got a hit.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.540
Look at this guy,
he's gorgeous.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.309
Let's not
get carried away.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.610
He looks like
George Clooney.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.445
Yeah, if you're into
that kind of thing.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.780
Most of us are.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.448
Good job,
likes to travel,

20:15.482 --> 20:17.384
Harvard grad.
He's perfect.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.386
Seems kind of
ordinary to me.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.454
Olympic medalist.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.323
I concede.

20:23.356 --> 20:27.727
He wants to meet Gray
this Saturday at
the Boathouse at 5:00.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.596
Do you think
we should tell her?

20:29.629 --> 20:31.664
Yeah, absolutely,
we should.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.666
And by we,
I mean you.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.569
Good luck.

20:38.605 --> 20:42.509
Everyone, in my hands,
I hold the cast list.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.446
Let the dreams begin.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.617
Someone named Zoe
got the lead?

20:50.650 --> 20:52.419
Who is Zoe?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.287
That new girl
Billy's dating.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.588
This new
drama teacher blows.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.457
Tell me about it.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.559
So, which parts did we get?

20:59.592 --> 21:01.428
I don't know.
I can't get close
enough to see.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.296
Excuse me.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.731
Get out of my way.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.601
Evil stepsisters?

21:10.603 --> 21:14.374
When I played Cinderella,
I was the youngest Cinderella

21:14.407 --> 21:16.476
in the history of acting.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.579
(CHUCKLING)
Congratulations!

21:19.612 --> 21:22.382
I can't even believe
this is happening.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.584
Wow, I got the lead.

21:24.617 --> 21:28.054
Looks like
it's you and me, Fadden.
Cindy and Charming.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.656
Guess so. Yeah.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.492
NICK: Cool.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.295
Sorry I'm late...

21:37.597 --> 21:39.332
Hey, Ben.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.401
We're Done?t done.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.569
Done with what?

21:42.602 --> 21:44.737
Parent-teacher
conferences, of course.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.839
I'll fill you in on
Jane's progress later.

21:46.873 --> 21:50.610
Right now, Mr. Wajid
is giving me a recipe
for spicy coconut curry.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.646
You don't like curry?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.348
Oh, he's such
a picky eater.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.883
You're missing out.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.652
Mom, when I
mentioned conferences,

21:59.686 --> 22:01.621
I didn't mean
you should come.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.391
Why wouldn't I?
It's parent-teacher day.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.659
Mr. Wajid is a teacher.
I'm a parent.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.827
She has a point.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.630
Yes, technically,
all that is true.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.365
Is there a problem?

22:12.399 --> 22:13.866
No, it's just...

22:13.900 --> 22:17.570
I appreciate you
taking an interest
in Jane's life,

22:17.604 --> 22:20.640
but I've kind of
got it all covered.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.910
I was just
trying to take
some of the load off.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.912
You always
seem so busy.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.714
I'm not that busy.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.515
Really?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.717
Then why were you
15 minutes late?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.654
I just want to help.
Let me help.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.657
She's a lovely lady.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.825
You should
take her up on it.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.159
Mr. Wajid, do you mind?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.928
I'm trying to have
a discussion with my mom.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.464
Why are you
getting so upset?

22:44.497 --> 22:45.632
I'm not upset.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.801
Good.
Because today
is a great day.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.704
Jane is above average
in her academics

22:51.738 --> 22:54.441
and her attitude
is excellent.
Isn't that right?

22:54.974 --> 22:56.676
Better than some
people I know.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.615
She's trying to be
supermom, and it's
getting on my nerves.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.817
JANE: She's just trying
to be part of our lives.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.719
I mean, isn't that
what we wanted?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.656
No, that's what you wanted.
I got dragged into this.

23:09.689 --> 23:12.625
You know, Ben,
you really need an
attitude adjustment.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.727
Yeah, I know.
Mr. Wajid told me.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.963
I just wish you could
be more understanding.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.566
Really?.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.534
Oh, so, then,
you're totally fine

23:21.568 --> 23:24.504
volunteering to do costumes
for the play with mom?

23:24.537 --> 23:26.639
Yeah.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.575
Right after
parent-teacher conferences,
she signed you both up.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.709
I don't have
time for that!

23:29.742 --> 23:31.778
Whoa, easy, Jane.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.813
She's just trying to be
a part of our lives.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.715
You should try to be
more understanding.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.651
I gotta go.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.986
And we will talk
about this later

23:40.019 --> 23:41.721
if I'm still alive.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.955
Why? What's wrong?

23:42.989 --> 23:44.724
I got to tell
Gray something.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.193
And if you don't
hear from me
in the next 24 hours,

23:47.226 --> 23:48.895
I want to be buried
with all of my shoes.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.669
What do you want?

23:56.703 --> 23:59.539
Want?
I don't want anything.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.740
Good.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.975
Actually, I...

24:03.009 --> 24:04.844
Here we go.

24:04.877 --> 24:08.615
Jane, I've had
a rotten morning
and my patience is low,

24:08.648 --> 24:11.751
so you've got
exactly 20 seconds
to spit it out.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.486
Right! Here goes.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.921
My mother, god bless her,

24:14.954 --> 24:17.023
created an online
dating profile for you.

24:17.757 --> 24:18.891
What?

24:18.925 --> 24:21.260
I know.
That was my reaction.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.762
And I was going
to take it down,

24:22.795 --> 24:24.797
but then, we got a hit.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.566
And you should
see this guy.
He is gorgeous

24:26.599 --> 24:28.768
and he's rich
and he likes all the same
things that you do.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.637
And you're not speaking
and you're turning red,

24:30.670 --> 24:31.771
so I'm gonna go
cancel immediately

24:31.804 --> 24:33.039
and work on my
letter of resignation.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.674
Don't move.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.781

are we talking about?

Nice try,
but wrong century,

the worst kind.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.713

your game if you plan
on beating Miss Clark.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.281
Girls, I'm not trying
to beat anyone.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.550

it's appropriate that you...

25:17.584 --> 25:19.819

win back Coach Quimby?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.087
Yes or no?

25:22.789 --> 25:23.956

It was controlled chaos.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.593
I organized his closet.

to be happy with it.

Mom, hi.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.047
What are you doing?

33:35.081 --> 33:36.248
Nothing.

33:36.282 --> 33:39.151
I'm not going
to do anything else
unless you ask me.

Yes, Mom.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.192
Well, I just
want to clarify.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.326
I don't want to be
yelled at again.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.427
I didn't yell.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.429
You were a tad stern.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.265
And when I'm dead,
you'll probably feel
guilty about it.

33:53.299 --> 33:56.535
That's great, Mom.
So, are you going
to help me or not?

33:58.337 --> 33:59.638

you doing here?

I needed to see you.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.587
Good for you,

34:48.620 --> 34:51.523
You know, most girls
are just so worried
about their figure.

have crazy respect
for people like you

34:53.459 --> 34:54.626

whatever they want.

You know what I want.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.567
Actually,
I was just leaving.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.536
Really?
That's too bad.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.439
AMANDA: Yeah. That's too bad.
It's really crowded in here.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.874
Do you mind if
we steal your table?

One Bloody Mary for you,
Tabasco on the side.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.516
She doesn't
like it too spicy.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.251
How nice
that you know that.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.320
Just a little
splash is all I need.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.754
I'm gonna grab
another chair.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.527
Ben.
So, I was thinking.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.730
Maybe Saturday,

36:04.763 --> 36:06.732
Maybe some dinner.
What do you say?

36:06.765 --> 36:08.734
I've got a game
on Saturday.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.537
Do you still wear
those cute uniforms?

36:11.570 --> 36:14.240
Oh, God,
I just remember
how cute you were

36:25.417 --> 36:26.652
Oh, no.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.220
I just need
some water. Rita?

36:28.254 --> 36:29.621

(GASPING)

36:34.760 --> 36:36.528
Why would you do this?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.365
You did this?

36:39.398 --> 36:41.467
I'm sorry.
It was stupid. Here.

And scene.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.145
What?

36:54.179 --> 36:56.648
This little one-sided
competition between us
was kind of fun for a while.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.684
Now it's just annoying.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.687
Do me a favor
and don't mess with
me again. Okay?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.589

want to be late.

I'll get you there.
I promise.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.784
So, meeting the parents.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.521
This thing with Zoe is
getting pretty serious, huh?

37:36.422 --> 37:37.589
I guess so.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.761
I'm happy for you.
I really am.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.030
So, what about you?

37:45.063 --> 37:47.366
How are things with
that guy at work?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.701
Eli?

37:49.735 --> 37:52.571
We keep talking
about this date,
but it hasn't happened.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.705
Do you want it to?

Billy, your dinner
with Zoe's parents
is in half an hour.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.430
That makes Gray's date
in half an hour, too.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.465
That's more important.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.801
Yes, Jane, it is.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.809
DAKOTA: I'm just saying
you could have
at least said goodbye.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.512
I In a letter..

39:06.545 --> 39:07.913
I think I deserve
better than that.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.481
You brought it with you?

39:09.515 --> 39:10.882
Yes, I did.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.518
JANE: Light's green, Mom.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.920
What are you gonna do?
Read it out loud to everyone?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.388
If I have to.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.823
No, you really
don't have to do that

39:17.856 --> 39:19.558
because it's none
of our business.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.659
No, no, no.
I wanna know what it says.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.927
JANE: Stay out of it.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.595
And the light's
still green, Mom.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.397
I'm a little
distracted here, Jane.

39:25.431 --> 39:26.765
JANE: And it's red again.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.534
You know,
maybe we should
just not talk.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.469
Great idea.
Nobody talk.

39:35.641 --> 39:39.545
Any minute now and Gray's
gonna be Donovan Decker's
ex-creative director.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.812

You.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.549
Oh.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.817
Should I know
who Donovan Decker is?

39:45.851 --> 39:47.819
Just make sure you're ready.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.721
Come on, Gray, come on.

you found your castle.
