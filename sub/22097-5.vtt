WEBVTT

00:03.038 --> 00:05.973
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:36.271 --> 00:39.001
Zak failed basic flight.

00:39.241 --> 00:41.402
And I should have flunked him,
but I didn't.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.376
The bottom line
is that I killed him.

00:43.445 --> 00:46.437
Walk out of this cabin
while you still can.

00:46.882 --> 00:50.978
I don't get it. How does a military
coded signal end up coming from in here?

00:52.654 --> 00:53.678
Food.

00:53.755 --> 00:54.744
<i>It's the Cylons.</i>

00:54.823 --> 00:57.121
Starbuck's wireless
and transponder just cut out.

00:57.192 --> 00:58.921
<i>Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.</i>

00:58.994 --> 01:00.894
And get herself killed.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.963
<i>Galactica, Boomer.
Hot Dog's aboard.</i>

01:10.038 --> 01:11.403
Yeah, so is his lunch.

01:11.473 --> 01:14.408
Take it easy, Hot Dog. You're not
the first to lose it in combat.

01:14.476 --> 01:15.807
You won't be the last.

01:15.877 --> 01:17.139
No sign of Starbuck.

01:17.212 --> 01:20.670
He says she was hit, but still in
the fight when he lost track of her.

01:20.749 --> 01:21.841
<i>Roger that, Boomer.</i>

01:21.917 --> 01:24.283
<i>Search and rescue ops
are underway for Starbuck.</i>

01:24.352 --> 01:27.446
<i>Bring Hot Dog in. The old
man wants to talk to him.</i>

01:27.522 --> 01:29.012
This is where you found him?

01:29.090 --> 01:31.524
Yes, sir, he drifted quite
a ways from the fight.

01:31.593 --> 01:32.992
Was she maneuvring?

01:33.061 --> 01:35.291
I think so. Yes. Yes, sir.

01:35.497 --> 01:38.125
So she survived the initial
hits. She could still be alive.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.463
She is alive, Lieutenant.
We're gonna find her.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.524
Yes, sir.

01:41.603 --> 01:42.865
Get this man to Sickbay.

01:42.938 --> 01:44.200
Yes, sir.

01:52.647 --> 01:54.877
I think
you earned those today.

02:01.756 --> 02:04.520
The auxiliary RT switch is
sticking a bit, sir, but she'll fly.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.651
Polish up the canopy.
I want it crystal clear.

02:06.728 --> 02:07.956
Yes, sir.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.939
Find her.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.337
I will.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.696
Oh, frack.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.272
Still no joy from
the search teams, sir.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.405
In the last four hours
we've combed everywhere...

05:15.482 --> 05:17.950
within a 200 click sphere of
Starbuck's last known position.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.952
No ship, no ejection seat,
no debris.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.488
So we're extending the radius
another 50.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.318
We need more pilots.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.658
Everybody who can fly
is up, sir.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.923
What about Starbuck's
course computations?

05:29.996 --> 05:33.227
The variables of combat maneuvring
make them almost meaningless, sir.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.426
It's time to start guessing.

05:35.635 --> 05:36.761
Yes, sir.

05:37.303 --> 05:40.067
Since there's been no
dradis contact in the area...

05:40.140 --> 05:41.835
I would have to guess...

05:41.908 --> 05:44.604
that her Viper was captured by
the gravity of a planetary body.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.478
The only nearby gravity wells
are the gas giant and this moon.

05:48.581 --> 05:52.381
If the gas giant pulled her in, its
radiation would fry her like an egg.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.976
What about the moon?

05:54.054 --> 05:58.150
The spectroscope people call the
atmosphere as CO2, methane, some argon.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.021
The clouds
are mostly hydrocarbons.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.994
It's cold as hell down there, but
she could survive on the surface.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.257
Until her oxygen runs out.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.354
When?

06:05.432 --> 06:07.423
46 hours and change, sir.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.498
That's a hell of a long time
to stay in one place.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.063
What if the Cylons appear?

06:15.141 --> 06:17.268
They won't, not for a while.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.868
What makes you say that?

06:19.946 --> 06:21.914
Sending a patrol
instead of the base ship...

06:21.981 --> 06:24.575
tells me they didn't even know
we were here.

06:24.651 --> 06:29.145
So they're searching a lot of other
places, places with potential supplies.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.822
Like staking out water holes
in the desert.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.486
If we sent eight fighters to
search an entire star system...

06:35.562 --> 06:40.158
for 60-odd ships,
it would take us weeks.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.025
Assume they're better and
faster. It'll take them days.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.136
A lot of assumptions
you're makin'.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.731
Educated guess.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.608
Talk to me about
searching the moon.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.873
That's going to be
slow goin'.

06:54.481 --> 06:57.177
We can't see squat
through those clouds.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.975
Send the ships
below the cloud cover.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.714
Tell the pilots to take a hard
look the old-fashioned way.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.955
Mark One Eyeball, sir?

07:09.829 --> 07:11.456
Mark One Eyeball.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.100
<i>Commander,
call from Colonial One.</i>

07:18.605 --> 07:19.594
Adama.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.197
Comdr. Adama, I don't wanna
take much of your time.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.540
I wanted to say how happy we all
are you found one of your pilots.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.204
<i>Thank you, Madam President.</i>

07:27.280 --> 07:29.908
How is the search progressing
for the other pilot?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.951
Nothing yet,
but we've just begun.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.418
<i>I've spoken with the
other captains in the fleet.</i>

07:34.487 --> 07:37.320
They've agreed to give over
their ships at your disposal...

07:37.390 --> 07:39.187
if it'll increase the odds
of finding her.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.955
<i>Frack the odds.
We're going to find her.</i>

07:46.533 --> 07:49.764
Excuse me. Thank you.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.972
Tell them
we could sure use the help.

07:54.407 --> 07:58.400
I'll coordinate their efforts
with your CIC. Continued good luck.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.842
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:03.550 --> 08:04.881
Thank you.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.786
So it looks like we're going
to be staying here for a while.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.856
You all right?

08:19.933 --> 08:22.163
Yeah, I'm fine,
it's just a...

08:23.136 --> 08:26.162
How long you think it will be before
the Cylons wonder what happened...

08:26.239 --> 08:29.970
to their missing patrol, and send
another one here to look for it?

08:30.043 --> 08:34.776
You have attacked us hundreds
of times. We're still here.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.510
I think you'll find that we are
more than adequately protected.

08:39.586 --> 08:43.078
Might be a little tricky with the
fleet scattered over half this system...

08:43.156 --> 08:45.249
looking for the lost pilot.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.350
How many days
till the Cylons return, Gaius?

08:50.263 --> 08:51.321
One?

08:54.300 --> 08:55.358
Two?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.499
Three at the most?

09:07.447 --> 09:08.641
Doctor?

09:10.483 --> 09:12.144
Your requisitions.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.418
Thank you.

09:23.129 --> 09:27.930
Madam President, I don't mean
to be impertinent, really, but...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.835
do you honestly think
this is wise?

09:31.337 --> 09:34.602
You are compromising the
security of the entire fleet...

09:34.674 --> 09:37.074
while we search
for one solitary pilot.

09:37.143 --> 09:41.705
It is a risk, but those pilots put
their lives on the line for us every day.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.875
Yes. I was just saying that,
to...

09:47.120 --> 09:49.384
I'm not insensitive to that,
is what I'm saying.

09:49.455 --> 09:52.288
I happen to know
the missing pilot personally.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.656
Not as personally
as you'd like.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.725
Guess you'll never get to find
out if she's a real blonde.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.765
Which makes it
all the more difficult for me,

09:59.832 --> 10:01.561
because on one hand
I think of the pilot.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.603
And then on the other hand I think
of the thousands of defenseless...

10:04.671 --> 10:09.131
women. And children, I meant.
Throughout the fleet.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.666
I am sure Cmdr. Adama
has considered all of this.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.406
Thank you, Doctor.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.679
Yes, of course he has.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.114
Of course he has. Thank you.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.886
It's okay. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.333
Okay, get to higher ground.

11:17.977 --> 11:21.936
Then they see you.
Then they rescue you.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.960
<i>Apollo, Galactica, we are being bounced
around like beach balls down here.</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:38.520
Visibility about two,
best spectrum.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.461
<i>Copy, Apollo.</i>

11:41.100 --> 11:44.035
Whoa! Blue Flight,
go vertical now! Now, now!

12:13.132 --> 12:14.394
Anything?

12:15.435 --> 12:16.424
No.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.769
I don't think
anyone's left out there.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.431
Must be someone.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.641
We can't be the only two
people left in the world.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.803
The good news
is my leg's much better...

12:26.879 --> 12:29.473
and we've got anti-radiation
meds to last three months.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.517
I say we load up
as much food as we can and...

12:31.584 --> 12:32.846
Move out.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.855
Try to find a Raptor or a transport
or something we can fly off Caprica.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.917
Unless you can think
of a reason to stay.

12:41.994 --> 12:45.259
Not really looking forward
to going back out there.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.558
I've almost started to think
of this place as home.

12:47.633 --> 12:48.725
Home.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.497
No, sleep a little longer.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.941
Who knows when we'll find
clean sheets again?

12:58.010 --> 13:01.104
I'm going to go topside
and make some breakfast.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.946
Breakfast.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.767
Hey, is breakfast ready?

14:31.537 --> 14:35.371
Get out of here! Go! Go! Go!

14:53.292 --> 14:56.125
Lords, it's Kara Thrace.

14:57.063 --> 15:01.523
I'm runnin' a little low on O2
and I could use a lucky break.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.268
No? Okay, just thought
I'd mention it.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.050
Oh, frack.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.569
Not bad shootin',
if I do say so myself.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.475
Lords, I owe you one.

16:21.047 --> 16:25.381
Looks like I found my ride
outta here. If I can fix you up.

16:32.224 --> 16:35.557
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Bingo fuel.</i>

16:36.162 --> 16:38.221
<i>Roger, Apollo. Return to base.</i>

16:38.297 --> 16:39.958
Can't you tank me in orbit?

16:40.032 --> 16:41.465
<i>Negative, Apollo.</i>

16:41.534 --> 16:45.436
<i>The tankers are refilling. You'll
be dry before they can launch.</i>

16:49.008 --> 16:50.270
Are these figures correct?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.401
Yes, sir.

16:51.477 --> 16:54.913
Atmospheric ops mean Viper and
Raptor engines run continuously.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.177
Fuel's going to be a real
problem if we keep it up.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.782
Any report from the civilian ships?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.254
Nothing.
They're spread pretty far out.

17:04.323 --> 17:07.486
We'll have a hell of a time trying
to cover them if the Cylons pop in.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.688
We should consider pulling the
civvies into a defensible formation.

17:10.763 --> 17:13.857
No. Keep all the ships
on the search.

17:14.100 --> 17:17.001
We've left enough people behind. I
don't wanna leave Starbuck behind.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.230
I'm just saying, committing
the entire fleet to this...

17:19.305 --> 17:20.636
I said no!

17:24.110 --> 17:28.513
We are going to find our missing pilot
and we're going to bring her home.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.115
We leave no one behind.

17:34.253 --> 17:35.982
Resume your duties.

17:59.073 --> 18:00.267
Sharon?

18:19.994 --> 18:21.859
Sharon, where are you?

18:38.012 --> 18:40.242
Damn it, Sharon,
where are you?

18:43.717 --> 18:44.911
Sharon!

18:50.558 --> 18:51.582
Sharon!

19:11.178 --> 19:12.440
Frack me.

19:14.215 --> 19:15.876
Are you alive?

19:41.208 --> 19:43.005
What the hell happened
this time, Captain?

19:43.077 --> 19:47.207
I hit the roll thrusters to level off
for set down but only the left one fired.

19:47.281 --> 19:49.476
It's that crap
you're flyin' into down there.

19:49.550 --> 19:50.983
Gums everything up.

19:51.051 --> 19:52.279
Get me another Viper.

19:52.353 --> 19:56.687
<i>Love to, Captain, but this is 13 Vipers
that are down, plus your Mark VII. I'm out.</i>

19:56.757 --> 19:59.351
Damn it, I've got a pilot down
and I need another Viper now.

19:59.426 --> 20:00.791
I realize that, Captain.

20:00.861 --> 20:04.024
But you can push people a hell of a
lot further than you can push machines.

20:04.098 --> 20:06.828
I'm the CAG, you're the
Chief. Just make it happen.

20:09.703 --> 20:14.333
Commander, the clock has passed five
hours, sir, for Starbuck's O2 supply.

20:14.441 --> 20:15.601
Noted.

20:15.843 --> 20:18.505
Here's the photo mosaic for
the area we searched so far.

20:18.579 --> 20:20.410
We've got to do
better than this.

20:20.481 --> 20:22.506
Can't see very far when
you're hugging the ground.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.517
You can't see anything at all
from altitude.

20:24.585 --> 20:27.452
Not to mention the crap in the air
that keeps screwing up our ships.

20:27.521 --> 20:29.489
Thirteen Vipers down
for repairs.

20:29.557 --> 20:30.888
We need more eyes.

20:30.958 --> 20:32.357
Where we going to get them?

20:32.426 --> 20:34.053
Pull the CAP.
What?

20:34.128 --> 20:36.562
Redeploy the Combat Air Patrol
to the search.

20:36.630 --> 20:39.463
Bad idea. The CAP
is the fleet's only defense.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.558
If all Vipers are frackin'
around on the moon...

20:41.635 --> 20:43.899
when the Cylons come callin',
we're maggot meat.

20:43.971 --> 20:45.666
Then bring the fleet
closer to the moon.

20:45.739 --> 20:48.606
We can always scramble the Vipers
from the search to meet any attack.

20:48.676 --> 20:49.700
You've got to be kidding.

20:49.777 --> 20:53.008
Bottom line, we can double the area
we can search in the time we have left.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.640
Starbuck would be the first
one to tell you not to do this.

20:55.716 --> 20:59.345
Nothing would make you happier,
would it? Leave her behind.

21:00.254 --> 21:04.657
Get rid of the foul-mouthed insubordinate
pilot that keeps challenging your authority.

21:04.725 --> 21:06.317
You are way out of line,
mister.

21:06.393 --> 21:08.884
I'm not the one confusing
personal feelings with duty.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.658
Oh, yeah?
What the hell does that mean?

21:10.731 --> 21:13.495
It means you are way too close
to this because she's your friend.

21:13.567 --> 21:14.864
Gentlemen!

21:18.639 --> 21:21.802
We have work to do. Captain.

21:31.585 --> 21:35.487
Get as many birds up in the air
as you can and we find our girl.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.825
You got it.

21:50.638 --> 21:53.004
Oh, my gods.

21:54.575 --> 21:57.066
You bite me,
and I'll bite you back.

22:00.481 --> 22:04.247
So I guess the only thing
flying you is you.

22:05.352 --> 22:07.320
This must be your brain.

22:18.365 --> 22:20.560
I don't think you'll need it.

22:23.570 --> 22:26.733
Good thing
that I brought one of my own.

22:42.790 --> 22:43.950
Frack.

22:46.427 --> 22:50.420
Even cockroaches have to
breathe. How the hell do you?

22:52.332 --> 22:54.425
Captain. Call for you, sir.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.470
Can someone finish this up
for me?

23:00.174 --> 23:01.971
Where is it?
That way.

23:03.410 --> 23:04.502
Yeah, Apollo.

23:04.578 --> 23:06.978
<i>Hold for President Roslin.</i>

23:07.381 --> 23:09.611
<i>How're you holding up?</i>

23:09.850 --> 23:14.116
Better than my Viper. We're slapping
one together from pieces of the others.

23:14.188 --> 23:15.519
<i>I need your help.</i>

23:15.589 --> 23:18.956
Did you know that your father just
redeployed the Combat Air Patrol?

23:19.026 --> 23:21.551
Yes, Madam President.
It was my idea.

23:21.762 --> 23:22.786
Your idea?

23:22.863 --> 23:24.694
We need every Viper we've got.

23:24.765 --> 23:27.825
<i>Maybe I'm missing something
about the tactics involved here...</i>

23:27.935 --> 23:31.029
but isn't the fleet
defenseless without the CAP?

23:31.171 --> 23:32.968
<i>Only for a short time.</i>

23:33.040 --> 23:34.905
Because after that...

23:34.975 --> 23:38.968
Because after that, Kara's oxygen
will be gone and she'll be dead.

23:39.179 --> 23:42.205
Are you very close
with Lt. Thrace?

23:43.350 --> 23:45.045
I'm close with all my pilots.

23:45.119 --> 23:48.111
And I assume the same is true
for your father?

23:48.188 --> 23:51.624
His pilots mean a lot to him. To all
of us. We don't leave anyone behind.

23:51.692 --> 23:54.354
But we have left
people behind. You know that.

23:54.528 --> 23:56.018
Not this time.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.463
Your FTL drive
should be spun up and ready.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.794
Just make sure everyone is set to
jump at the first sign of trouble.

24:02.870 --> 24:05.134
With all due respect,
Captain...

24:05.205 --> 24:09.141
there are times when it is necessary
for the safety of the fleet to put...

24:09.209 --> 24:10.733
Not this time.

24:11.678 --> 24:13.339
Madam President...

24:13.714 --> 24:16.046
we just haven't exhausted
all the options...

24:16.116 --> 24:19.210
and the safety of the fleet
has not been compromised.

24:21.355 --> 24:23.118
I hope you find her.

24:23.757 --> 24:25.088
Thank you.

24:31.398 --> 24:33.764
Blue Flight
reports bingo fuel, sir.

24:33.834 --> 24:37.270
Have them stay on the search.
Send the tanker to them.

24:41.141 --> 24:43.371
Is there a problem, Mr. Gaeta?

24:44.144 --> 24:48.706
It's just that trying to tank in that
turbulence, sir, will be extremely hairy.

24:48.782 --> 24:51.876
I suggest we wait until
the clock has run down...

24:52.286 --> 24:55.278
<i>and then tank up
on the way back to Galactica.</i>

24:55.956 --> 24:58.652
<i>Did someone call them
back to Galactica?</i>

24:59.793 --> 25:01.226
I just assumed...

25:01.295 --> 25:04.458
The search was over?
It was hopeless?

25:05.899 --> 25:07.890
That we should write
Starbuck off as dead?

25:07.968 --> 25:09.697
Is that what you're
telling me, Mr. Gaeta?

25:09.770 --> 25:10.998
No, sir.

25:11.071 --> 25:14.131
Then what are you trying
to tell me, Mr. Gaeta?

25:20.714 --> 25:22.511
You have your orders.

25:23.116 --> 25:24.378
Yes, sir.

25:28.155 --> 25:31.647
Time's up. She's out of O2.

25:32.326 --> 25:33.725
The clock is a guess.

25:33.794 --> 25:36.729
We don't know for a fact
that Starbuck is out of air.

25:36.797 --> 25:39.231
Her tank only holds
so much oxygen.

25:39.299 --> 25:42.598
She could have a reserve
supply in her survival gear.

25:43.170 --> 25:44.660
A reserve?
Yes.

25:45.072 --> 25:48.508
What, she just happened
to pack an extra bottle today?

25:48.642 --> 25:50.109
It's possible.

25:50.177 --> 25:53.374
We are putting people at risk.
We have pilots out there...

25:53.447 --> 25:54.539
We are not quitting.

25:54.615 --> 25:57.914
...pushing themselves and their
ships too hard, all for the sake of...

25:57.985 --> 26:01.887
We are not quitting
and you are relieved, Colonel.

26:12.032 --> 26:14.557
I stand relieved, sir.

26:55.140 --> 26:58.234
Come on, you're
part biological, right?

26:58.444 --> 27:02.437
Which means you need oxygen,
right?

27:03.148 --> 27:06.140
So it's got to be here
somewhere.

27:40.152 --> 27:42.143
Commander, the President.

27:47.693 --> 27:48.751
Adama.

27:48.827 --> 27:53.093
Cmdr. Adama, I just wanted to say
how very sorry I am about Lt. Thrace.

27:53.232 --> 27:56.599
Please give my condolences to your
son and to the rest of the crew.

27:56.668 --> 27:59.762
Excuse me, ma'am, but I
think you've been misinformed.

28:00.072 --> 28:01.096
How?

28:01.173 --> 28:02.572
We don't know
if Starbuck's dead.

28:02.641 --> 28:06.202
<i>I was told that her oxygen
had run out a half an hour ago.</i>

28:06.512 --> 28:09.709
That's an estimate.
She may have a reserve supply.

28:10.516 --> 28:14.077
We'll continue the search as long
as there's a chance she may be alive.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.676
And how long will that be?

28:15.754 --> 28:17.153
<i>Until I say stop.</i>

28:17.222 --> 28:19.713
This is a military decision,
Madam President.

28:19.791 --> 28:21.691
Thank you for your concern.

28:25.964 --> 28:29.365
First on the list,
seal you up...

28:30.168 --> 28:32.398
figure out what controls what.

29:08.073 --> 29:09.973
One of us needs a bath.

29:14.179 --> 29:16.340
Now you're going to teach me
how to fly.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.177
Commander?

29:21.320 --> 29:24.187
Red Flight reports an area
of highlands here.

29:24.256 --> 29:27.157
Increased visibility
out to 15 clicks maybe.

29:27.292 --> 29:28.691
It's the wrong side
of the moon.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.749
Excuse me, Commander...

29:29.828 --> 29:30.920
Almost impossible to...

29:30.996 --> 29:33.055
<i>We have a signal
from Colonial One's shuttle.</i>

29:33.131 --> 29:35.861
They request permission to land.
They have the President on board.

29:35.934 --> 29:38.368
Why wasn't I notified the
President was coming onboard?

29:38.437 --> 29:40.769
There was no advance notice,
sir.

29:41.506 --> 29:43.440
I didn't know she was coming.

29:43.508 --> 29:44.770
Let's go.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.642
Have Col. Tigh meet her
at the airlock.

29:49.715 --> 29:51.182
Bring her to my quarters,
please.

29:51.249 --> 29:52.409
Very well.

29:53.785 --> 29:56.720
Every flying machine
has four basic controls:

29:57.456 --> 30:00.857
Power, pitch, yaw, and roll.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.252
Where are yours?

30:17.809 --> 30:20.073
Safety tip number one:
Don't touch that.

30:21.213 --> 30:24.148
Are you going to order us
to stop the search?

30:24.449 --> 30:26.610
I came here to talk,
not to give orders.

30:26.685 --> 30:28.175
It may take an order.

30:28.253 --> 30:29.311
Why?

30:30.522 --> 30:33.150
Col. Tigh,
do I need to know something?

30:33.925 --> 30:38.362
It's gone beyond military needs. It's
personal for the Commander and for Lee.

30:38.430 --> 30:40.295
Because of Lt. Thrace?

30:40.365 --> 30:43.664
Because of her,
and because of Zak Adama.

30:44.236 --> 30:46.033
The Commander's dead son.

30:46.104 --> 30:49.267
It's complicated. Take
about three weeks to explain.

30:49.341 --> 30:51.536
We've got about three minutes.
Talk fast.

30:57.349 --> 30:59.010
She's gonna press.

31:01.019 --> 31:02.486
I'm with you.

31:03.355 --> 31:04.982
President Roslin.

31:06.425 --> 31:07.653
Madam President.

31:07.726 --> 31:09.990
Skip the formalities.
You both know why I'm here.

31:10.062 --> 31:13.293
Termination of a pilot's rescue
mission is a military decision.

31:13.365 --> 31:16.994
That's a bunch of crap. This
isn't military, it's personal.

31:17.602 --> 31:21.834
Neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace
because she's your last link to Zak.

31:21.907 --> 31:23.636
You don't know
anything about my brother.

31:23.709 --> 31:25.734
Don't even begin, Captain.

31:26.411 --> 31:28.709
You've lost perspective.
As have you.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.078
Under normal circumstances
it would just be sad...

31:31.149 --> 31:33.549
that the two of you can't
come to terms with Zak's death.

31:33.618 --> 31:35.848
In this situation you're
putting your pilots at risk...

31:35.921 --> 31:37.548
and you're exposing
the entire fleet...

31:37.622 --> 31:39.556
to possible attack
every moment we stay here.

31:39.624 --> 31:42.923
We've been at risk of
an attack since day one.

31:43.662 --> 31:47.723
The Cylons won't be missing their
patrol for at least one more day.

31:49.501 --> 31:50.900
Col. Tigh...

31:51.269 --> 31:54.898
how much aviation fuel has
been expended in this operation?

31:55.140 --> 31:57.438
Forty-three percent
of reserves.

31:58.243 --> 32:00.643
Almost half.
That's unacceptable.

32:01.646 --> 32:04.206
Operations
in the moon's atmosphere...

32:04.282 --> 32:06.409
have put one third of your
fighters out of action.

32:06.485 --> 32:09.454
That is also
completely unacceptable.

32:09.888 --> 32:13.824
"Crap. " "Unacceptable. " Whatever
it is you feel about this...

32:14.359 --> 32:17.419
the recovery of one pilot
is a military matter.

32:19.364 --> 32:23.664
All right.
It's military. Fine.

32:25.737 --> 32:29.571
And you're both officers.
And you're both honorable men.

32:29.841 --> 32:32.901
And you're both perfectly aware
that you are putting the lives...

32:32.978 --> 32:34.275
of over 45,000 people...

32:34.346 --> 32:37.281
and the future of this
civilization at risk...

32:37.883 --> 32:39.976
for your personal feelings.

32:41.186 --> 32:44.815
Now if the two of you, of all
people, can live with that...

32:46.358 --> 32:49.327
then the human race
doesn't stand a chance.

32:50.362 --> 32:51.989
Clear your heads.

33:14.119 --> 33:16.349
Combat. Stand by.

33:23.461 --> 33:25.053
This is the Commander.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.588
Terminate search operations.
Bring everyone home.

33:29.768 --> 33:33.829
Prepare the fleet to make a jump
to the next system. We're leaving.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.607
Okay, so it either works
or it doesn't.

34:21.017 --> 34:25.351
Okay, okay, it's power, roll,
pitch, and yaw.

34:26.189 --> 34:29.352
We have control. Take me home.

34:44.340 --> 34:47.400
You stink, but you're
one hell of a flying machine.

34:52.115 --> 34:54.811
I want you to know,
I think she's wrong.

34:55.752 --> 34:58.482
I think we have come to terms
with what happened to Zak.

34:58.554 --> 34:59.885
I haven't.

35:04.961 --> 35:06.952
I need to know something.

35:16.606 --> 35:20.474
Why did you do this?
Why did we do this?

35:21.744 --> 35:25.737
Is it for Kara? For Zak? What?

35:26.649 --> 35:28.241
Kara was family.

35:28.651 --> 35:32.644
You do whatever you have to do.
Sometimes you break the rules.

35:35.525 --> 35:37.618
And if it was me
down there instead?

35:37.694 --> 35:39.787
You don't have to ask that.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.730
Are you sure?

35:43.132 --> 35:44.759
If it were you...

35:46.703 --> 35:48.330
we'd never leave.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.610
Colonel.
Commander.

36:03.486 --> 36:05.113
Resume your duties.

36:05.188 --> 36:07.588
Sir, fighters are aboard, sir.

36:08.157 --> 36:10.819
Civilian ships have begun their
jumps to the next star system.

36:10.893 --> 36:12.724
You give the word,
we'll start our clock.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.126
Start the clock.

36:14.197 --> 36:15.391
Mr. Gaeta, start the clock.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.454
Starting clock.

36:16.532 --> 36:19.000
Madam President, would you
like to return to your ship?

36:19.068 --> 36:22.697
Thank you, I'll stay here. I'd like
to see how the professionals do it.

36:22.772 --> 36:24.171
As you wish.

36:35.918 --> 36:37.886
Execute jump, Lt. Gaeta.

36:38.087 --> 36:40.385
Aye, sir.
Jump clock is running.

36:40.590 --> 36:41.784
Navigation? Go.

36:41.858 --> 36:42.847
FTL?

36:42.925 --> 36:43.949
Go.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.551
Tactical? Go.

36:45.628 --> 36:46.686
Flight Ops?

36:46.763 --> 36:49.061
Contact. Dradis contact.

36:49.132 --> 36:53.034
Incoming, bearing 060,
carom 308.

36:54.003 --> 36:54.992
Hold count.

36:55.071 --> 36:56.095
Count held.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.196
Contact is...

36:57.273 --> 36:59.002
Holding count.

37:00.443 --> 37:01.535
Well?

37:03.146 --> 37:04.807
Cylon Raider, sir.

37:05.581 --> 37:08.175
You're right.
It's just a matter of time.

37:08.251 --> 37:11.516
He's on an intercept course. He'll
be on us before we complete the jump.

37:11.587 --> 37:13.817
Action stations,
launch Vipers.

37:14.724 --> 37:16.589
<i>Action stations. Action stations.</i>

37:16.659 --> 37:19.822
<i>Launch alert, fighters.
Cylon Raider approaching.</i>

37:30.139 --> 37:32.835
Okay, now look
before you shoot, please.

37:34.911 --> 37:37.812
Gun captains report
weapons manned and ready.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.313
Where the hell are the Vipers?

37:39.382 --> 37:41.145
Most are being fuelled.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.412
Hot Dog and Apollo
are in the tubes.

37:48.691 --> 37:50.522
<i>Viper I, clear forward.</i>

37:50.593 --> 37:54.256
<i>Navcon Green, interval
failure. Abort launch.</i>

37:54.397 --> 37:55.557
Frack!

37:56.599 --> 37:58.066
Frack! Frack! Frack!

37:59.135 --> 38:01.035
I guess I'm going solo.

38:01.704 --> 38:03.899
Why only one Cylon this time?

38:05.441 --> 38:07.875
It could be
a lone recon mission...

38:08.077 --> 38:11.774
or the vanguard for a Cylon base
ship about to jump on top of us.

38:11.848 --> 38:14.908
Either way, we're gonna have to
take it out before we can jump.

38:15.852 --> 38:18.286
<i>Galactica, Apollo.
Target in sight.</i>

38:28.131 --> 38:31.794
You idiot. Didn't anybody
teach you intercept protocol?

38:32.401 --> 38:35.859
Okay, we're going to have
to do this the hard way then.

38:44.413 --> 38:46.176
This bastard's good.

38:46.916 --> 38:49.111
They're closing fast. Port
guns have a firing solution.

38:49.185 --> 38:50.209
Very well.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.225
Hold still, you little...

38:57.293 --> 38:58.920
No cigar for you.

38:59.295 --> 39:03.026
Just a little bit closer.

39:06.169 --> 39:07.693
Not that close!

39:10.406 --> 39:11.805
What the...

39:12.875 --> 39:14.365
<i>I've lost him.</i>

39:14.610 --> 39:17.408
<i>Galactica, I repeat,
he is nowhere to be seen.</i>

39:17.480 --> 39:18.674
Dradis.

39:18.915 --> 39:20.780
No help. Their reports
have merged.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.249
Launch tube status?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.478
Still fouled.

39:23.553 --> 39:25.521
We'll have a Viper away
in 45 seconds.

39:25.588 --> 39:27.613
This will be over
in 45 seconds.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.728
Holy...

39:39.135 --> 39:42.696
<i>Galactica, the Cylon is now
flying in formation with me...</i>

39:43.206 --> 39:44.969
<i>right above my head.</i>

39:45.541 --> 39:47.475
<i>This thing is acting weird.</i>

39:47.543 --> 39:48.567
Put me through.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.180
<i>It's Starbuck!</i>

40:02.758 --> 40:03.850
What?

40:05.161 --> 40:06.890
Come again, Apollo?

40:08.564 --> 40:11.692
<i>Galactica, the Cylon Raider
is marked "Starbuck. "</i>

40:11.767 --> 40:14.292
<i>It's written
under the frackin' wing.</i>

40:32.955 --> 40:34.820
Bring it into the bay.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.455
If it does anything,
take it out.

40:38.628 --> 40:42.064
<i>Wilco, Galactica, but I tell
you what, it's got to be her.</i>

40:42.131 --> 40:44.622
<i>This thing is flying
with some serious attitude.</i>

40:59.782 --> 41:01.875
Now your ass belongs to me.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.181
Like my new toy?

41:08.491 --> 41:12.325
Boy, when you take a souvenir,
you don't screw around.

41:13.062 --> 41:15.257
Oh, my God,
you smell like a latrine.

41:16.632 --> 41:18.725
You want to give me a bath?

41:30.012 --> 41:31.741
How're you feeling?

41:32.448 --> 41:34.541
Been a hell of a lot worse.

41:35.985 --> 41:38.613
Don't have any ambrosia,
but the Doc...

41:39.021 --> 41:41.854
can fix you up
with some really nice stuff.

41:44.226 --> 41:46.820
It's not bad, is it? The knee?

41:47.863 --> 41:52.061
Doc says it's too early to tell,
but knowing you, you'll be fine.

41:54.270 --> 41:55.362
Kara.

41:56.505 --> 41:57.597
Yeah?

42:01.610 --> 42:03.077
You did good.

42:09.518 --> 42:11.179
You did real good.

42:19.895 --> 42:21.385
Need anything?

42:21.464 --> 42:23.364
A stogie would be nice.

42:24.133 --> 42:25.725
I had a feeling.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.703
It's my last one,
so enjoy it.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.176
Thank you.

42:37.613 --> 42:39.103
Get some rest.
