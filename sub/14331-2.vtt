09:25.932 --> 09:27.700
HELLO, POOF.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.903
I KNEW TO DEFEAT YOU I'D HAVE
TO BECOME SOMETHING TRULY EVIL.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.705
SO I BECAME A LAWYER.

09:32.772 --> 09:33.839
AND I OBJECT

09:33.906 --> 09:36.008
TO YOUR EXISTENCE!

09:36.075 --> 09:38.344
- FOOP, POOF IS NOT
ON TRIAL HERE.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.679
TIMMY TURNER IS.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.347
groupies: YAY, TIMMY!

09:41.414 --> 09:42.982
- I'M WELL AWARE
OF THAT, JORGEN.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.717
BUT IF TURNER
IS CONVICTED,

09:44.784 --> 09:46.519
THEN ALL HIS WISHES
WILL BE ERASED.

09:46.585 --> 09:49.922
INCLUDING THAT PUTRID
PURPLE PAIN IN MY PANTS.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.123
all: [gasp]

09:51.190 --> 09:52.325
- THAT'S RIGHT.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.160
POOF WAS ONE
OF TIMMY'S WISHES.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.328
IF TIMMY LOSES,

09:55.394 --> 09:57.797
THEN POOF
WILL BE GONE FOREVER!

09:57.863 --> 09:59.465
- AND WATCHING HIM
GET ERASED WILL BE

09:59.532 --> 10:00.499
A BLAST.

10:00.566 --> 10:04.070
[laughs wickedly]

10:04.136 --> 10:05.938
OOH.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.708
[grunts]

10:09.809 --> 10:10.876
I REQUEST A SHORT RECESS

10:10.943 --> 10:13.212
WHILE THE SECOND-DEGREE
BURNS HEAL.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.581
- COSMO, YOU'VE GOT TO WIN!

10:15.648 --> 10:18.617
- WE NEED TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT
THE WORST FAIRY GODKID EVER.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.586
- WHAT?
I THOUGHT WE HAD TO PROVE

10:20.653 --> 10:22.254
YOU WERE
THE WORST GODKID EVER.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.091
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH
ALL THIS EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU?

10:25.157 --> 10:28.461
- I'LL TAKE THAT!

10:28.527 --> 10:31.297
AND YOU'LL TAKE THIS.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.138
I'M GOING TO NEED
ANOTHER SHORT RECESS

10:39.205 --> 10:42.541
WHILE I RECOVER
FROM THE INTERNAL INJURIES.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.878
IN ANY EVENT,
TIMMY TURNER IS DOOMED!

10:45.945 --> 10:47.380
AND SO ARE YOU, POOF.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.983
[screams]
BLACKING OUT FROM THE PAIN.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.452
[moans]

10:53.519 --> 10:55.654
- THE TRIAL OF TIMMY TURNER

10:55.721 --> 10:57.523
WILL NOW BEGIN.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.498
- MEMBERS
OF THE FAIRY COUNCIL,

11:05.564 --> 11:06.732
I WILL NOW PROVE

11:06.799 --> 11:08.434
THAT TIMMY TURNER IS GUILTY

11:08.501 --> 11:10.936
OF BEING THE WORST GODKID
IN HISTORY.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.172
groupies: YAY, TIMMY!

11:13.239 --> 11:14.440
- EXHIBIT A:

11:14.507 --> 11:16.208
TIMMY TURNER
IS RESPONSIBLE

11:16.275 --> 11:18.210
FOR GLOBAL WARMING!

11:18.277 --> 11:20.513
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:20.579 --> 11:22.815
- ROLL THE CLIP.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.985
- SO COLD.
SICK OF WINTER.

11:26.052 --> 11:29.288
I WISH IT WAS WARMER.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.293
- NOT ONLY DID HIS WISH
MELT THE POLAR ICE CAPS,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.295
IT ALSO THAWED OUT
BIG WILLY,

11:36.362 --> 11:39.799
THE BELLIGERENT CAVEMAN
WHO, AS WE ALL KNOW,

11:39.865 --> 11:42.001
BECAME THE WORLD'S SCARIEST
CROSSING GUARD.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.836
- [growling]

11:43.903 --> 11:48.307
[roars]

11:48.374 --> 11:50.643
[children screaming]

11:50.709 --> 11:51.744
[all gasping]

11:51.811 --> 11:54.013
- HEY, LESS CARS,
LESS POLLUTION.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.414
- EXHIBIT B:

11:55.481 --> 11:58.651
TIMMY TURNER WISHED
FOR IT TO RAIN RABID DINGOS.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.853
- WHAT?
I DID NOT!

12:00.920 --> 12:02.621
- ROLL THE CLIP.

12:02.688 --> 12:05.791
- I'M BORED. I WISH
IT WOULD RAIN RABID DINGOS.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.729
[dingos barking]

12:10.796 --> 12:14.200
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,
"IT'S RAINING RABID DINGOS.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.569
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT
YOUR HOLIDAY WEEKEND?"

12:16.635 --> 12:19.738
[screams]
MY WEEKEND IS RUINED.

12:19.805 --> 12:20.739
[all gasping]

12:20.806 --> 12:22.741
- COSMO, WE'RE LOSING!

12:22.808 --> 12:24.677
DO SOMETHING!
- RIGHT, TIMMY.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.945
I MOVE TO STRIKE.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.016
DRAT.
I LEFT THE TEN PIN.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.952
OH, I'M A TERRIBLE LAWYER.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.721
- AND THOSE EXAMPLES
ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.824
- WHICH TIMMY MELTED.
- HEY! NOT HELPING!

12:38.891 --> 12:41.360
- HE'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE
FOR ATHLETE'S FOOT.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.096
[all gasping]

12:44.163 --> 12:45.498
- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.666
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
MAKE ME GOOD AT SOCCER.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.103
- AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S
HIS NOW-INFAMOUS STINGER WISH.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.506
- BEES ARE COOL.
I WISH EVERYONE HAD A STINGER.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.977
- HEY, LOOK, A PENNY.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.813
- OW!
- OW!

13:00.880 --> 13:04.817
- OW!
- HONEY, OOH, I MADE HONEY.

13:04.884 --> 13:10.489
- OW.
all: OW! OW!

13:10.556 --> 13:12.224
- NEAT. A STINGER.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.425
OH, MOTHER.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.597
- I COULD PROCEED
WITH MORE EVIDENCE,

13:18.664 --> 13:20.099
BUT MY SIPPY CUP
IS EMPTY,

13:20.166 --> 13:21.534
AND MY DIAPER IS FULL.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.435
THE PROSECUTION RESTS.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.138
BRING IN THE EXECUTIONER!

13:26.205 --> 13:28.140
HELLO, ROBERTO.
I LIKE YOUR NEW HOOD.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.042
IT MATCHES THE BLACKNESS
IN MY HEART.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.076
- [roars]

13:31.143 --> 13:32.678
- [screams]

13:34.180 --> 13:36.715
- COSMO, YOU MAY PRESENT
YOUR DEFENSE.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.684
- THE DEFENSE RESTS.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.452
- WHAT?
YOU HAVEN'T PRESENTED A CASE!

13:40.519 --> 13:42.054
- NO, I NEED TO REST.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.223
ALL THAT BOWLING
REALLY WORE ME OUT.

13:44.290 --> 13:47.459
[snoring, muttering]

13:47.526 --> 13:50.029
- IT'S HOPELESS.
I'M GONNA LOSE EVERYTHING.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.564
MY LIFE IS RUINED!

13:51.630 --> 13:53.532
groupies: YAY, TIMMY!

13:53.599 --> 13:54.800
- DON'T WORRY, SPORT.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.869
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THIS.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.437
MEMBERS OF THE FAIRY COUNCIL,

13:58.504 --> 14:02.074
I CAN PROVE TIMMY TURNER HAS
DONE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS TOO.

14:02.141 --> 14:05.277
I CALL MY FIRST WITNESS,
THE CRIMSON CHIN.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.548
- SAY, THIS ISN'T MY BATHROOM.

14:09.615 --> 14:12.418
SOME NEFARIOUS FIEND
HAS HIJACKED THE TUB OF JUSTICE

14:12.484 --> 14:14.553
AND THE RUBBER DUCKY
OF DEMOCRACY.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.388
- SORRY, CRIMSON CHIN.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.891
I BROUGHT YOU TO FAIRY COURT
TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF

14:18.958 --> 14:20.192
OF TIMMY TURNER.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.460
ISN'T IT TRUE

14:21.527 --> 14:24.563
THAT TIMMY IS YOUR LOYAL
CRIME-FIGHTING SIDEKICK?

14:24.630 --> 14:27.466
- YES.
CLEFT, THE BOY CHIN WONDER.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.702
HE HELPS ME KEEP
CHINCINATTI SAFE

14:29.768 --> 14:31.570
FROM EVILDOERS EVERYWHERE.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.839
- THANK YOU.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

14:35.841 --> 14:38.110
- MR. CHIN,
ISN'T IT ALSO TRUE

14:38.177 --> 14:40.079
THAT TIMMY TURNER
UNLEASHED YOUR NEMESIS,

14:40.145 --> 14:41.780
THE NEGA-CHIN,
ONTO THE WORLD,

14:41.847 --> 14:44.116
WISHED THAT THE LOVE
OF YOUR LIFE, GOLDILOCKS,

14:44.183 --> 14:45.484
WOULD BECOME
THE EVIL HAIR-RAZOR,

14:45.551 --> 14:48.153
AND MADE YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU'RE NOTHING MORE

14:48.220 --> 14:49.655
THAN A SILLY
COMIC BOOK CHARACTER?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.124
- YES.
YES, YES.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.993
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M IN THIS BATHTUB?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.327
I'M TRYING
TO SCRUB AWAY THE PAIN

14:55.394 --> 14:57.229
WITH THE LOOFAH
OF LIBERTY.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.064
- THERE, THERE,
MR. CHIN.

14:59.131 --> 15:02.034
WE'RE ALL TRYING
TO SCRUB AWAY THE PAIN--

15:02.101 --> 15:04.436
THE PAIN OF KNOWING
TIMMY TURNER.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.338
ROBERTO!

15:07.840 --> 15:08.874
- [roars]

15:11.477 --> 15:14.046
- AH!
WANDA, DO SOMETHING!

15:14.113 --> 15:15.281
- DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.517
FOR MY NEXT WITNESS,
I CALL MARK CHANG.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.520
- YO, TIMMY!

15:21.587 --> 15:24.123
YO, TIMMY'S FLOATY FRIENDS.

15:24.189 --> 15:26.292
WHOA, COURT ROOM,
JURY,

15:26.358 --> 15:28.327
HOODED DUDE WITH A AXE.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.863
WHY AM I
AT A YUGOPOTAMIAN BAR MITZVAH?

15:30.929 --> 15:32.564
- IT'S NOT
A BAR MITZVAH, MARK.

15:32.631 --> 15:33.699
YOU'RE IN FAIRY COURT,

15:33.766 --> 15:35.534
AND I'M ON TRIAL
FOR MY LIFE!

15:35.601 --> 15:37.636
- SO THERE'S NO BRISKET?

15:37.703 --> 15:39.305
BUMMER.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.773
- MR. CHANG,

15:40.839 --> 15:43.442
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH
THE DEFENDANT TIMMY TURNER?

15:43.509 --> 15:46.045
- SH'YA!
HE'S A TOTALLY GNARLY DUDE

15:46.111 --> 15:48.981
AND MY NUMBER ONE BRASINSKI.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.216
- OBJECTION.
MAKE HIM USE REAL WORDS.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.518
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.920
- HE'S SAYING THAT TIMMY
IS A GOOD PERSON

15:54.987 --> 15:55.921
AND A GOOD FRIEND.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.389
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

15:57.456 --> 16:01.093
- I SEE HERE YOU'RE
FROM THE PLANET YUGOPOTAMIA.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.428
AND ISN'T IT TRUE
ON YOUR PLANET,

16:02.494 --> 16:03.595
EVERYTHING IS OPPOSITE?

16:03.662 --> 16:04.963
SO THAT WHEN YOU
SAY SOMETHING IS BAD,

16:05.030 --> 16:06.231
IT REALLY MEANS IT'S GOOD?

16:06.298 --> 16:09.301
- YOU GOT IT, SQUARE, BLUE,
HAIRY BABY DUDE.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.303
- SO WHEN YOU SAY
TIMMY TURNER IS GOOD,

16:11.370 --> 16:12.604
YOU REALLY MEAN
HE'S BAD?

16:12.671 --> 16:13.939
- WELL...

16:14.006 --> 16:15.574
- AND WHEN YOU SAY
HE'S BEEN A FRIEND,

16:15.641 --> 16:16.942
YOU MEAN
HE'S BEEN AN ENEMY, RIGHT?

16:17.009 --> 16:18.711
- UGH!
MY MIND!

16:18.777 --> 16:20.379
YOU'RE MESSING WITH IT!

16:20.446 --> 16:21.647
AHH!

16:21.714 --> 16:22.781
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.650
IN YOUR FACE,
WANDA.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.152
ROBERTO!

16:27.219 --> 16:28.487
- [growls]

16:28.554 --> 16:30.756
[roars]

16:30.823 --> 16:32.624
- IT'S OKAY, TIMMY.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.360
I HAVE OTHER WITNESSES.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.862
- OH, YEAH, IS IT SOMEONE
REALLY AWESOME AND TRUSTWORTHY

16:36.929 --> 16:38.931
WHO LIKES ME A LOT?
- YOU BET.

16:38.997 --> 16:43.102
I CALL DARK LASER
TO THE STAND!

16:43.168 --> 16:44.269
- [screams]

16:44.336 --> 16:48.674
- OH, FLIPSY,
GIVE DADDY A KISS...

16:49.875 --> 16:51.243
IS WHAT I WOULD SAY

16:51.310 --> 16:53.545
IF I WEREN'T A DIABOLICAL
VILLAIN INTENT ON RULING

16:53.612 --> 16:56.181
THE UNIVERSE.
[laughs wickedly]

16:56.248 --> 16:58.150
- DARK LASER,
ISN'T IT TRUE

16:58.217 --> 17:00.018
THAT TIMMY TURNER
WISHED YOU TO LIFE?

17:00.085 --> 17:01.987
- YES, IT IS.
FLIPSY AND I EXIST

17:02.054 --> 17:03.655
BECAUSE OF TIMMY TURNER.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.824
- THANK YOU.
YOUR WITNESS, FOOP.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.659
- MR. LAZAR...

17:07.726 --> 17:09.294
- IT'S PRONOUNCED LASER.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.530
- AH, YES,
MR. LASER,

17:11.597 --> 17:14.500
ISN'T IT ALSO TRUE THAT,
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE,

17:14.566 --> 17:17.202
YOU'VE ENSLAVED
4,000 PLANETS IN THE GALAXY,

17:17.269 --> 17:18.604
CAUSING PAIN AND MISERY

17:18.670 --> 17:20.638
TO UNTOLD MILLIONS?

17:20.705 --> 17:23.175
- AND AGONY.
DON'T FORGET THE AGONY.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.676
- AND ALL BECAUSE
TIMMY TURNER

17:25.743 --> 17:27.846
MADE A WISH
FOR YOU TO BE REAL.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.049
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
I WIN.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.652
YOU GOT SERVED.
YAY, ME!

17:35.120 --> 17:36.255
- I OBJECT.

17:36.321 --> 17:37.689
- ON WHAT GROUNDS?

17:37.756 --> 17:40.325
- ON THE GROUNDS
THAT WE'RE LOSING?

17:40.392 --> 17:41.527
COSMO, WAKE UP.

17:41.593 --> 17:44.196
- HUH? WHOA!
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM

17:44.263 --> 17:45.597
THAT WE WERE
IN A COURT ROOM

17:45.664 --> 17:47.733
AND TIMMY WAS ON TRIAL
FOR HIS LIFE.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.835
- COSMO, I AM ON TRIAL
FOR MY LIFE.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.136
- WHOA!

17:51.203 --> 17:53.038
WHATEVER I DREAM
BECOMES REAL.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.506
I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO SLEEP

17:54.573 --> 17:55.974
AND DREAM THAT YOU'RE
NOT REALLY TOTALLY DOOMED.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.509
OH, AND THAT
I GET A PUPPY.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.544
AND CHEST HAIR.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.145
- COSMO, FOCUS.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.147
WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY
WHO HAS SOMETHING GOOD

18:02.214 --> 18:04.349
TO SAY ABOUT ME.
- POOF, POOF!

18:04.416 --> 18:07.352
- LOOK, POOF WANTS
TO SPEAK FOR YOU, TIMMY.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.788
- POOF, POOF-POOF, POOF.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.257
- HMM, INTERESTING POINT,
POOF.

18:12.324 --> 18:15.060
SO YOU'RE SAYING TIMMY'S MADE
GOOD WISHES TOO.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.030
ROLL THE CLIP.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.631
- OH, LOOK.

18:19.698 --> 18:22.568
THAT'S WHEN TIMMY WISHED HIS MOM
COULD BE MISS DIMMSDALE

18:22.634 --> 18:25.170
SO SHE'D FEEL BEAUTIFUL AGAIN.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.773
- AND THAT'S WHEN TIMMY WISHED
HIS DAD COULD BE MISS DIMMSDALE

18:27.840 --> 18:29.875
SO HE'D FEEL BEAUTIFUL AGAIN.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.443
- OH, COSMO.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.445
THAT'S THE DAY
TIMMY WISHED UP POOF

18:33.512 --> 18:36.014
SO WE COULD ALL
BE A FAMILY.

18:36.081 --> 18:36.982
all: AWW.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.518
AWW.
[weeping]

18:39.585 --> 18:41.086
- [sobs]

18:41.153 --> 18:42.721
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.690
POOF HAS MADE IT CLEAR
TO THE COURT

18:44.756 --> 18:46.959
THAT TIMMY TURNER
IS DEFINITELY NOT

18:47.025 --> 18:48.627
THE WORST GODKID.

18:48.694 --> 18:49.795
- YES!

18:49.862 --> 18:50.929
- OBJECTION!

18:50.996 --> 18:52.865
- ON WHAT GROUNDS?

18:52.931 --> 18:54.166
- GIVE ME A MINUTE.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.667
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
IN THESE LEGAL BRIEFS.

19:00.439 --> 19:04.009
COME ON, COME ON.
THROW ME A BONE HERE.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.445
A-HA!

19:06.512 --> 19:07.746
I HAVE DISCOVERED

19:07.813 --> 19:09.815
DEVASTATING EVIDENCE
AGAINST TIMMY TURNER.

19:09.882 --> 19:13.085
HE HASN'T MADE
A MILLION WISHES AFTER ALL.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.921
HE'S MADE
A MILLION AND ONE.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.524
[all gasping]

19:18.590 --> 19:21.360
- FOOP, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SAYING?

19:21.426 --> 19:26.031
- I'M SAYING THAT TIMMY TURNER
MADE A SECRET WISH.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.967
[all gasping;
Foop laughing wickedly]

19:29.034 --> 19:30.435
- A SECRET WISH?

19:30.502 --> 19:32.437
BUT THAT'S
THE ULTIMATE VIOLATION

19:32.504 --> 19:33.772
OF FAIRY LAW.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.941
- EVERY WISH
MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.278
OTHERWISE, GODCHILDREN COULD
SECRETLY ALTER THE VERY FABRIC

19:39.344 --> 19:40.445
OF THE UNIVERSE.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.947
- I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER

19:42.014 --> 19:43.081
THE LAST SECRET WISH--

19:43.148 --> 19:45.350
DECEMBER 19, 1986.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.053
LITTLE JOSHUA APPLEBEE
SECRETLY WISHED

19:48.120 --> 19:51.356
FOR CHUCKLES,
THE FAIRY-EATING COCKATIEL.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.694
[all screaming]

19:55.761 --> 19:58.163
- [screams]
- OH, COME ON.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.966
WHAT'S SO SCARY
ABOUT A SILLY BIRD?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.235
[Chuckles shrieks;
fairies scream]

20:03.302 --> 20:06.605
[all screaming]

20:06.672 --> 20:08.206
OKAY,
THAT'S TOTALLY SCARY.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.975
- EVER SINCE
THAT FATEFUL DAY,

20:10.042 --> 20:13.045
ALL WISHES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY
DOCUMENTED TO AVOID

20:13.111 --> 20:14.313
FURTHER CATASTROPHE.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.783
BUT SOMEHOW
TURNER GOT AROUND THE RULES.

20:17.849 --> 20:18.984
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.787
WE NEVER GRANTED TIMMY
A SECRET WISH.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.121
RIGHT, COSMO?

20:23.188 --> 20:24.556
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.625
BUT THEN I DON'T REMEMBER
A LOT OF THINGS.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.594
HEY, WHAT ARE WE DOING
IN A BOWLING ALLEY?

20:28.660 --> 20:30.862
- TIMMY, WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.036
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.005
I DID MAKE A SECRET WISH.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.640
COSMO DOESN'T REMEMBER
GRANTING IT,

20:41.707 --> 20:43.342
BECAUSE I WISHED HE'D FORGET.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.211
[dramatic music]

20:46.278 --> 20:47.980
- SORRY.
I JUST LOVE

20:48.046 --> 20:48.981
TO PLAY AT FUNERALS.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.282
- TURNER!

20:50.349 --> 20:51.783
WHAT DID YOU WISH FOR?

20:51.850 --> 20:53.518
- OKAY, DON'T BE MAD,

20:53.585 --> 20:56.188
BUT I SECRETLY WISHED THAT
EVERYONE WOULD STOP AGING

20:56.254 --> 20:58.991
SO THAT I COULD STAY TEN YEARS
OLD AND KEEP MY FAIRIES FOREVER.

20:59.057 --> 21:00.859
- WHA--
WHAT?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.327
WHEN DID YOU
MAKE THIS WISH?

21:02.394 --> 21:04.162
- FIFTY YEARS AGO.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.564
[all gasping]

21:05.631 --> 21:07.699
- SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT,

21:07.766 --> 21:09.868
YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE
ON EARTH

21:09.935 --> 21:12.337
ARE ACTUALLY
50 YEARS OLDER?

21:12.404 --> 21:13.839
- DO THE MATH, JORGEN.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.874
10 PLUS 50 IS 13.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.042
YOU'RE FINE, TIMMY.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.210
LET'S ALL GO HOME.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.511
IF MY HUNCH IS CORRECT,

21:19.578 --> 21:21.513
THERE SHOULD BE A PUPPY THERE
WAITING FOR ME.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.950
- TIMMY TURNER,
THIS IS AN EGREGIOUS VIOLATION

21:25.017 --> 21:26.118
OF FAIRY LAW.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.121
- YOU ARE TRULY
THE WORST FAIRY GODKID

21:29.187 --> 21:30.856
IN HISTORY.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.391
- THROW THE BOOK AT HIM.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.126
LIKE THIS.
[grunts]

21:37.095 --> 21:39.631
- STARTING TO REMEMBER
WHY WE'RE HERE NOW.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.733
- IT IS THE DECISION
OF THIS COUNCIL

21:41.800 --> 21:44.169
THAT EVERY WISH TIMMY TURNER
HAS EVER MADE

21:44.236 --> 21:45.871
WILL BE UNDONE.

21:45.937 --> 21:49.574
AND HE WILL HAVE NO MEMORY
OF HIS FAIRY GODPARENTS.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.742
all: WHAT?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.944
groupies: YAY, TIMMY!

21:54.112 --> 21:55.614
- NO!

22:00.352 --> 22:02.320
- TIMMY TURNER,
YOU HAVE MADE A SECRET WISH

22:02.387 --> 22:03.689
AND BEEN FOUND GUILTY

22:03.755 --> 22:06.491
OF BEING
THE WORST FAIRY GODKID EVER.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.859
AS A RESULT,

22:07.926 --> 22:10.595
ALL OF YOUR WISHES
WILL NOW BE UNDONE.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.330
- YES!
I WON THE CASE.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.598
TAKE THAT, POOF!

22:13.665 --> 22:15.534
- [blows raspberry]

22:15.600 --> 22:19.037
- FOOP, YOU DO REALIZE
THAT YOU ARE POOF'S ANTI-FAIRY.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.338
WHICH MEANS,
IF HE GOES,

22:20.405 --> 22:21.373
YOU GO.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.108
- NO!
I WON THE CASE.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.110
SAVE ME, POOF.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.046
- AND NOW TIMMY TURNER'S WISHES
WILL BE ERASED FOREVERMORE,

22:28.113 --> 22:31.416
AD INFINITUM,
E. PLURIBUS UNUM,

22:31.483 --> 22:35.020
AND A LOT OF OTHER LATIN WORDS
NO ONE USES IN REAL LIFE.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.322
[blathers]
- NO! POOF!

22:37.389 --> 22:38.423
[sobbing]

22:38.490 --> 22:40.092
- HUG ME TOO!
I'M FRIGHTENED.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.426
I TELL YOU WHAT,
SPARE ME,

22:41.493 --> 22:42.694
AND ALL THIS
WILL BE YOURS.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.863
WELL, NOT ALL OF IT.
CAN YOU BREAK A ONE?

22:46.098 --> 22:48.934
[moans]

22:49.000 --> 22:50.702
[screaming]

22:50.769 --> 22:52.738
both: POOF!

22:52.804 --> 22:55.073
- [screams]

22:55.140 --> 22:56.241
- OH, NO.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.342
OUR BABY!

22:57.409 --> 22:58.443
- [whimpers]

22:58.510 --> 22:59.811
TIMMY!

22:59.878 --> 23:01.313
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

23:01.379 --> 23:02.781
- I'M SO SORRY.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.083
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT I'LL MAKE THIS RIGHT.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.720
NO!
WHERE'D THEY GO?

23:08.787 --> 23:10.622
- COSMO AND WANDA
HAVE BEEN SENT BACK

23:10.689 --> 23:12.958
TO FAIRY WORLD
WHERE, THANKS TO YOU,

23:13.024 --> 23:15.260
THEY WILL HAVE NO MEMORY
OF THEIR BABY.

23:15.327 --> 23:18.864
- AND NOW IT IS TIME
TO UNDO YOUR SECRET WISH.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.832
BRING IN FATHER TIME.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.272
YOO-HOO!
FATHER TIME!

23:27.339 --> 23:30.442
- SORRY, SORRY,
I FORGOT TO SET MY WATCH

23:30.509 --> 23:32.210
FOR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.279
I SPRUNG AHEAD
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN BACK.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.314
HEY, I BROUGHT GIFTS!

23:36.381 --> 23:37.516
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

23:37.582 --> 23:39.084
THERE'S NO PRESENT
LIKE THE TIME.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.086
GET IT?
- HE'S BEEN DOING THAT SAME JOKE

23:41.153 --> 23:42.454
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.723
- SO THIS IS THE KID
WHO MADE THE SECRET WISH?

23:44.790 --> 23:46.825
YOU DON'T GET
A WATCH, MISTER!

23:46.892 --> 23:48.593
I WILL NOW
SET THINGS RIGHT

23:48.660 --> 23:51.530
BY ADVANCING
TIME ON EARTH 50 YEARS.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.965
SHAZAM!

23:54.032 --> 23:55.200
- NOTHING HAPPENED.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.402
- I KNOW.
I JUST LIKE SAYING "SHAZAM."

23:57.469 --> 23:58.670
AND OTHER "Z" WORDS.

23:58.737 --> 24:02.174
LIKE JACUZZI, ZING,
ZAMBONI, XYLOPHONE.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.942
DOESN'T HAVE A "Z,"
BUT SOUNDS LIKE ONE.

24:04.009 --> 24:07.445
TIMMY TURNER,
YOU ARE ABOUT TO AGE 50 YEARS

24:07.512 --> 24:08.914
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.416
- AND YOU WILL HAVE NO MEMORY
OF YOUR FAIRIES

24:11.483 --> 24:13.018
OR OF THIS COUNCIL.

24:15.854 --> 24:19.291
- NO!

24:27.199 --> 24:28.967
[alarm clock beeps]

24:29.034 --> 24:30.569
- [grunts]

24:30.635 --> 24:32.103

24:32.170 --> 24:35.106
JUMPIN' JEHOSHAPHAT.

24:35.173 --> 24:38.376
WAIT, WHAT?
WHY DO I SOUND LIKE AN OLD MAN?

24:38.443 --> 24:40.779
[screams]

24:40.846 --> 24:43.949
[squeaking joints]

24:44.015 --> 24:45.951
LEAPIN' LIVER SPOTS.

24:46.017 --> 24:48.086
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME?

24:50.188 --> 24:52.524
I'M--I'M--
[snoring]

24:52.591 --> 24:54.326
OLD!

24:54.392 --> 24:57.429
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA
REPORTING.

24:57.495 --> 25:01.666
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
HAS MYSTERIOUSLY AGED 50 YEARS.

25:01.733 --> 25:07.405
IN BREAKING NEWS--
MY BACK! AAGH!

25:07.472 --> 25:09.507
THIS JUST IN--
MY NEW TEETH!

25:09.574 --> 25:11.109
- HOLY TOLEDO.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.311
EVERYONE'S AGED
50 YEARS.

25:13.378 --> 25:14.880
WELL, I GUESS
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

25:14.946 --> 25:17.115
I'M A FULL-GROWN ADULT
LIVING ON MY OWN.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.150
- OH, TIMMY!

25:21.219 --> 25:22.787
- OKAY, I'M HALF RIGHT.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.991
- WATCH OUT. I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO STOP THIS THING.

25:29.227 --> 25:31.263
OH, WAIT,
YES, I DO.

25:31.329 --> 25:32.631
HELP ME OUT, SON.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.999
IT'S TIME FOR BREAKFAST,

25:34.065 --> 25:35.901
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHERE THE KITCHEN IS.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.404
[beeping]
TIMMY!

25:39.471 --> 25:41.039
THERE'S A WITCH
IN THE KITCHEN!

25:41.106 --> 25:44.109
LET'S DROP THE HOUSE ON HER
AND STEAL HER RUBY SLIPPERS.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.077
- MORNING,
WEIRD OLD MEN.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.580
HOW ABOUT
SOME DELICIOUS OATMEAL?

25:51.950 --> 25:53.218
AND I'LL GET YOUR JUICE

25:54.452 --> 25:56.554

WHO-ZEE-WHAT'S-IT.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.724
- YOU HAVE ACTIVATED
THE SELF-DESTRUCT FUNCTION.

25:59.791 --> 26:00.792
- OH, DEAR.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.594
MAYBE WE SHOULD EAT OUT.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.529
- HANG ON, WITCH.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.865
I'M GONNA FLOOR IT.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.234
- FIVE SECONDS
TILL SELF-DESTRUCT.

26:09.301 --> 26:13.271
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...
[explosion and screaming]

26:15.540 --> 26:17.575
- CHESTER?
AJ?

26:17.642 --> 26:20.178
- TIMMY? YOUR MOM
BLEW UP YOUR HOUSE TOO?

26:20.245 --> 26:23.014
- MAN, IT'S LIKE NO ONE SEEMS
TO KNOW HOW TO USE

26:23.081 --> 26:25.283
THEIR AUTOMATIC

26:25.350 --> 26:28.153
[explosions]

26:28.219 --> 26:29.321
- HEY, TWERP!

26:29.387 --> 26:30.455
DON'T THINK
YOU'RE TOO OLD

26:30.522 --> 26:32.190
FOR ME TO BABYSIT YOU.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.692
[motor stalls]

26:33.758 --> 26:34.726
HANG ON.

26:34.793 --> 26:35.794
[straining]

26:35.860 --> 26:38.830
ANY MINUTE NOW.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.365
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A HAND?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.534
- BYE, VICKY.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.804
- WHOOPS, I ACTIVATED
THE SELF-DESTRUCT FUNCTION.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.573
DAG-NABIT!
[screams]

26:48.640 --> 26:50.375
- FELLAS, WHAT HAPPENED?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.711
HOW DID WE
SUDDENLY GET SO OLD?

26:52.777 --> 26:56.247
- WHO CARES? I'M FINALLY
GETTING MY BRACES OFF!

26:56.314 --> 26:57.549
YEE-HAW!

27:00.652 --> 27:02.554
OH, THAT'S BETTER.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.457
NOW LET'S GO MEET
SOME GIRLS.

27:05.523 --> 27:06.992
- THERE'S ONE NOW.

27:07.058 --> 27:08.493
[squeaking joints]

27:08.560 --> 27:10.195
- I SAW HER FIRST!

27:10.261 --> 27:11.596
- [hollers]

27:15.033 --> 27:16.601
- I FEEL SO WEIRD.

27:16.668 --> 27:19.137
AND NOT JUST 'CAUSE I'M WEARING
AN ADULT DIAPER.

27:19.204 --> 27:23.408
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING
FROM MY LIFE.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.909
DO I KNOW YOU?

27:24.976 --> 27:26.611
- TALKING TO BALLOONS,
TURNER?

27:26.678 --> 27:28.146
YOU'RE LOOPIER
THAN I AM.

27:28.213 --> 27:29.414
AND I'M 103.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.749
- MR. CROCKER?

27:30.815 --> 27:32.784
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU'VE AGED AT ALL.

27:32.851 --> 27:35.020
- OH, I'VE LOOKED THIS WAY
SINCE I WAS TEN.

27:35.086 --> 27:37.555
SOMETHING TRAUMATIC HAPPENED
THAT AGED ME ALL AT ONCE.

27:37.622 --> 27:40.125
IT GAVE ME THIS HUMP AND LOWERED
MY EARS ONTO MY NECK.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.159
- WHAT WAS IT?

27:41.226 --> 27:42.560
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

27:42.627 --> 27:45.063
EVERYONE KNOWS IT WAS THE DAY
I LOST MY FAIRIES!

27:45.130 --> 27:46.431
- WAIT A MINUTE.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.033
THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING
FROM MY LIFE.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.402
I THINK I USED
TO HAVE FAIRIES!

27:50.468 --> 27:52.904
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DID HAVE FAIRIES!

27:52.971 --> 27:54.773
both: FAIRIES!
FAIRIES!

27:54.839 --> 27:57.008
FAIRIES!
[panting]

27:57.075 --> 27:58.610
- YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD,
TURNER.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.378
DID YOU BUMP YOUR HUMP
ON THE BENCH?

28:00.445 --> 28:01.980
ROOKIE MOVE.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.682
- NO, BUT I THINK I DID
SOMETHING REALLY BAD

28:04.749 --> 28:05.950
TO MY FAIRIES.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.119
LOOK, YOU KNOW
A WHOLE LOT ABOUT FAIRIES.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.754
WILL YOU HELP ME
FIND MINE?

28:09.821 --> 28:11.790
- HMM.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

28:11.856 --> 28:12.991
- ANYTHING YOU WANT.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.359
- WELL, I COULD GO
FOR A BRAN MUFFIN

28:14.426 --> 28:15.593
AND SOME PRUNE JUICE.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.328
LET'S NOT GET
INTO THE REASON WHY.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.930
- DEAL.
- GREAT!

28:18.997 --> 28:20.498
LET'S RACE
TO THE CROCKER CAVE.

28:20.565 --> 28:23.601
RIGHT AFTER A QUICK NAP.
[both snoring]

28:24.702 --> 28:26.104
YOU'RE IN LUCK, TURNER!

28:26.171 --> 28:27.338
I'VE INVENTED

28:27.405 --> 28:28.673
AN INTER-DIMENSIONAL
MATTER TRANSPORTER

28:28.740 --> 28:30.675
THAT CAN TAKE US
TO THE LEGENDARY HOME

28:30.742 --> 28:33.044
OF THE FAIRIES,
FAIRY WORLD.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.380
[alarm blares]

28:35.447 --> 28:36.614
- DENZEL!

28:36.681 --> 28:37.916
ARE YOU PLAYING AROUND

28:37.982 --> 28:40.585
WITH THAT STUPID FAIRY-HUNTING
EQUIPMENT AGAIN?

28:40.652 --> 28:42.654
- LEAVE ME ALONE, MOTHER!

28:42.720 --> 28:44.322
ALL THAT HEALTHY LIVING.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.824
SHE'S 130 YEARS OLD.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.360
HAVE A BAG OF PORK RINDS
AND STEP INTO THE LIGHT ALREADY!

28:49.427 --> 28:50.962
- COME ON, MR. CROCKER.

28:51.029 --> 28:54.099
LET'S GET IN THAT ROCKET
AND BLAST OFF TO FAIRY WORLD.

28:54.165 --> 28:55.800
I KNOW
THE ANSWERS ARE THERE.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.236
- OH, THE ROCKET JUST TAKES US
TO THE LIVING ROOM.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.271
THAT'S WHERE
THE MATTER TRANSPORTER IS.

29:11.349 --> 29:12.717
- IS THIS THING SAFE?

29:12.784 --> 29:14.486
- I'VE NEVER USED IT
PERSONALLY.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.321
BUT I DID TEST IT
ON MOTHER'S CAT.

29:20.225 --> 29:21.826
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
HIS NAME WAS SMOKY

29:21.893 --> 29:24.129
EVEN BEFORE I USED HIM
AS A TEST SUBJECT.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.499
I TESTED IT
ON MOTHER'S BIRD AS WELL.

29:27.565 --> 29:30.101
COINCIDENTALLY,
HIS NAME IS PILE OF GOO.

29:30.168 --> 29:32.604
- YOU'VE GOT THIS SET
TO THE SURFACE OF THE SUN.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.339
- SO I DO.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.774
I REALLY GOT TO GET
NEW READING GLASSES.

29:36.841 --> 29:38.877
TO FAIRY WORLD!

29:38.943 --> 29:40.245
RIGHT AFTER A QUICK NAP.

29:40.311 --> 29:41.880
[both snoring]

29:45.150 --> 29:46.618
- WE DID IT, MR. CROCKER.

29:46.684 --> 29:48.153
WE'RE IN FAIRY WORLD.

29:48.219 --> 29:49.921
AND WE'RE NOT
A PILE OF GOO!

29:51.489 --> 29:53.958
- [exclaims]
THERE ARE FAIRIES EVERYWHERE!

29:54.025 --> 29:56.461
both: FAIRIES!
FAIRIES! FAIRIES!

29:56.528 --> 29:58.796
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TONE THIS DOWN,

29:58.863 --> 30:00.431
OR WE'RE NEVER GONNA
GET ANYWHERE.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.467
NOW HELP ME FIND
MY FAIRIES.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.701
- NOT A PROBLEM.

30:03.768 --> 30:04.969
I SNAPPED A PHOTO OF THEM
ONE WEEKEND

30:05.036 --> 30:06.804
WHEN I WAS DISGUISED
AS YOUR MOM.

30:06.871 --> 30:08.373
HAVE TO ADMIT,
THINGS GOT A BIT AWKWARD

30:08.439 --> 30:09.908
WITH YOUR DAD.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.078
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I REMEMBER THEM NOW.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.080
THEIR NAMES
WERE CARLOS AND WENDY.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.750
UH, NO, WAIT.
CONAN AND WILMA?

30:18.816 --> 30:20.919
NO. IT'S ON THE TIP
OF MY TONGUE.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.054
OH, YEAH.
THEY WERE BOTH NAMED ZEKE.

30:24.522 --> 30:25.790
- YOO-HOO!

30:25.857 --> 30:27.792
IF ANY OF YOU KNOW
TWO FAIRIES NAMED ZEKE,

30:27.859 --> 30:29.360
CAN YOU TELL THEM
WE'RE WAITING FOR THEM

30:29.427 --> 30:31.229
AT THE CORNER
OF COSMO AND WANDA?

30:31.296 --> 30:33.932
- COSMO AND WANDA.
THAT'S IT!

30:36.234 --> 30:37.869
[doorbell rings]

30:37.936 --> 30:39.671
COSMO!
WANDA!

30:39.737 --> 30:44.309
- DAH! WANDA, IT'S MR. CROCKER
AND A CREEPY, OLD MAN.

30:44.375 --> 30:48.846
- COSMO, I THINK THAT CREEPY,
OLD MAN WAS CREEPY, OLD TIMMY.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.848
- BOY, FIFTH GRADE
WAS REALLY HARD ON HIM.

30:50.915 --> 30:53.251
- GUYS, IT'S ME,
TIMMY!

30:53.318 --> 30:54.786
- DON'T FALL FOR IT,
WANDA.

30:54.852 --> 30:57.255
LAST TIME AN OLD MAN CAME BY
SAYING WE WERE HIS FAIRIES,

30:57.322 --> 30:58.623
I ENDED UP CHAINED
TO THE WATER HEATER

30:58.690 --> 31:00.258
WHILE HE STOLE
OUR DVD PLAYER.

31:00.325 --> 31:03.728
- TIMMY? HOW DO WE KNOW
IT'S REALLY YOU?

31:03.795 --> 31:04.963
- TELL US SOMETHING

31:05.029 --> 31:07.098
THAT ONLY THE REAL
TIMMY TURNER WOULD KNOW.

31:07.165 --> 31:10.335
- OH, OKAY, COSMO,
YOU DRESS LIKE A PRINCESS

31:10.401 --> 31:12.904
AND PRETEND TO RULE THE BATHROOM
WHEN WANDA GOES SHOPPING.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.039
- IT IS YOU!

31:15.106 --> 31:16.708
I MEAN,
THAT WAS OUR SECRET!

31:16.774 --> 31:19.510
both: TIMMY!

31:19.577 --> 31:21.145
- HOW DID YOU FIND US?

31:21.212 --> 31:22.714
- MR. CROCKER HELPED ME

31:22.780 --> 31:24.983
IN EXCHANGE FOR PRUNE JUICE
AND A BRAN MUFFIN.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.018
- LET'S NOT GET
INTO THE REASON WHY.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.787
- TIMMY, WOULD YOU MIND IF I
MADE YOU TEN YEARS OLD AGAIN?

31:29.854 --> 31:31.689
YOUR HUMP
IS REALLY CREEPING ME OUT.

31:35.159 --> 31:38.029
- AWESOME! GUYS, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

31:38.096 --> 31:40.698
BUT IT STILL FEELS
LIKE SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

31:40.765 --> 31:43.201
- I WAS JUST SAYING THE SAME
THING TO THIS PURPLE SOCCER BALL

31:43.268 --> 31:44.502
I DRESSED UP
LIKE A BABY.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.471
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I REMEMBER NOW.

31:46.537 --> 31:49.507
YOU GUYS HAD A BABY,
A BABY THAT I WISHED FOR.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.243
BUT ALL MY WISHES WERE ERASED,
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.646
- A BABY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:54.712 --> 31:56.914
- GAH!
TIMMY'S RIGHT.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.583
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING NOW.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.885
SHE WAS SQUARE AND GREEN
AND HER NAME WAS ZEKE.

32:00.952 --> 32:02.854
- WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.189
IF ANYONE KNOWS
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON,

32:05.256 --> 32:06.691
IT'S JORGEN.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.526
- I THINK
THE PRUNES ARE KICKING IN.

32:13.331 --> 32:14.932
- TURNER?

32:14.999 --> 32:15.967
MR. CROCKER?

32:16.034 --> 32:17.168
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:17.235 --> 32:19.270
AND HOW DID YOU FIND
COSMO AND WANDA?

32:19.337 --> 32:20.605
- NEVER MIND THAT.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.707
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT
OUR BABY GIRL, ZEKE.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.276
- OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR BABY.

32:25.343 --> 32:27.645
FAIRY LAW PROHIBITED ME
FROM TELLING YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.248
ALL THAT GUILT CAUSED ME
TO REALLY LET MYSELF GO.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.450
- SO WE REALLY DO HAVE
A DAUGHTER?

32:32.517 --> 32:35.086
- NO, YOU HAVE A SON,
BUT HIS NAME IS NOT ZEKE.

32:35.153 --> 32:36.321
IT IS POOF.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.856
- REALLY?
I KIND OF LIKE ZEKE BETTER.

32:38.923 --> 32:41.659
- HE WAS ERASED, ALONG WITH ALL
OF TURNER'S OTHER WISHES,

32:41.726 --> 32:44.295
WHEN TURNER WAS FOUND
TO BE THE WORST GODKID EVER.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.630
- OH, MAN.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.365
I REMEMBER IT ALL.

32:47.432 --> 32:49.467
I MADE A SECRET WISH
AND LOST EVERYTHING,

32:49.534 --> 32:50.768
INCLUDING POOF.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.704
PASS THE FROSTING.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.007
- MY BABY!

32:56.074 --> 32:57.875
HE'S GONE FOREVER.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.143
- NOT EXACTLY.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.578
WHEN WISHES ARE UNDONE,

33:00.645 --> 33:03.948
{\an1}THEY ARE SENT TO A GRAY,
SAD, LIFELESS NEVER WORLD.

33:04.015 --> 33:07.085
- OH, NO, OUR BABY'S
IN HACKENSACK, NEW JERSEY!

33:07.151 --> 33:09.387
- EVEN WORSE.

33:09.454 --> 33:10.988
THE HOCUS POCONOS,

33:11.055 --> 33:12.223
A TERRIFYING LIMBO

33:12.290 --> 33:13.925
FILLED WITH ERASED WISHES.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.761
- THIS IS MY FAULT.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.563
I'M GONNA RESCUE POOF.

33:18.629 --> 33:19.697
- ZEKE!

33:19.764 --> 33:21.366
- NO MATTER
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.134
- WE'RE GOING WITH YOU.

33:23.201 --> 33:26.471
- VERY WELL, THEN WE ARE OFF
TO THE HOCUS POCONOS.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.840
WE WILL NEED BRAVERY
AND FORTITUDE,

33:28.906 --> 33:30.308
AND I'LL NEED
SOME MORE FROSTING.

33:30.375 --> 33:34.011
MM.
- AND I'LL NEED A QUICK NAP.

33:35.446 --> 33:38.383

[vehicle beeps]

33:45.757 --> 33:47.024

33:47.091 --> 33:49.060

NEW JERSEY!

33:49.127 --> 33:51.496
NOW WE'LL NEVER GET
DECENT CHINESE FOOD!

33:51.562 --> 33:52.730
[dingos barking]

33:52.797 --> 33:55.266
- AH!
IT'S RAINING RABID DINGOS!

33:55.333 --> 33:57.168
BOY, THAT TAKES ME BACK.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.870
GOOD TIMES.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.271
[all screaming]

34:02.440 --> 34:04.208
- OKAY.
LET'S FIND POOF

34:04.275 --> 34:06.477
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
- WE'D BETTER HURRY.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.913
WE ONLY HAVE A SMALL WINDOW
OF TIME TO ESCAPE.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.516
- WOW.
THAT IS A SMALL WINDOW.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.453
- I KNOW. THEY USED TO BE
GIANT FRENCH DOORS OF TIME.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.089
BUT THE FAIRY ELDER
HAD THIS PLACE TOTALLY REDONE.

34:18.156 --> 34:20.625
[stomping]

34:20.690 --> 34:22.326
- BWAH!

- AAGH!

34:30.333 --> 34:33.237
[all screaming]

34:33.304 --> 34:34.938
- THAT MONSTER
LOOKS FAMILIAR.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.541
- YEAH.
IT'S ONE OF YOUR WISHES.

34:36.607 --> 34:39.409
THE GIANT FIRE-BREATHING CYCLOPS
YOU TOOK TRICK-OR-TREATING.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.913
[all screaming]

34:41.978 --> 34:44.748
HE'S STILL MAD THAT
OLD LADY JENKINS ONLY GAVE HIM

34:44.815 --> 34:46.117
A BOX OF RAISINS.

34:46.184 --> 34:49.620
- TRICK OR TREAT!

34:50.688 --> 34:51.621
- WHOA!

34:51.688 --> 34:52.824
SOMEBODY GIVE HIM CANDY.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.161
- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

34:57.228 --> 34:58.930
OUR MAGIC
DOESN'T WORK HERE.

34:58.996 --> 35:01.699
- BWAH!

35:01.766 --> 35:03.568
- HOW ABOUT SOME PRUNES,
CYCLOPS?

35:03.634 --> 35:05.203
THEY'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING FOR ME.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.604
- NO DRIED FRUITS.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.473
HAVE WE LEARNED NOTHING
FROM THE HORRIBLE FATE

35:08.539 --> 35:10.575
THAT BEFELL
OLD LADY JENKINS?

35:10.641 --> 35:13.845
- BWAH!

35:13.911 --> 35:16.214
- THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING SWEET WE CAN GIVE HIM.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.584
- WHAT?
NOT MY FROSTING.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.153
I WILL DEFEND IT
UNTIL MY LAST BREATH.

35:22.220 --> 35:25.756
- BWAH!

35:25.823 --> 35:27.558
- FINE.
TAKE IT.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.694
I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT BUTTERSCOTCH ANYWAY.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.728
- THANK YOU.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.763
HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

35:32.830 --> 35:33.865
- NOW LET'S FIND POOF.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.967
I HOPE
HE ISN'T IN DANGER.

35:36.033 --> 35:38.603
- GAH!
WE'RE IN TERRIBLE DANGER!

35:38.669 --> 35:41.105
- LAWN GNOMES
WITH HEDGE-TRIMMER ARMS?

35:41.172 --> 35:43.307
HONESTLY, FLIPSY,
WHO WOULD EVEN WISH FOR THAT?

35:43.374 --> 35:44.308
[Flipsy barks]

35:44.375 --> 35:46.010
YES, IT PROBABLY
WAS TURNER.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.112
ANYTHING
TO AVOID YARD WORK.

35:48.179 --> 35:49.547
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S SCARIER--

35:49.614 --> 35:51.983
THE GNOMES OR THE FACT
THAT YOU TALK TO A TOY DOG.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.584
- STOP, POINTY-HATTED FIENDS.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.087
YOU MAY HAVE LONG ARMS
AND HEDGE TRIMMERS,

35:56.153 --> 35:59.257
BUT WE HAVE
THE LONG JAW OF JUSTICE.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.424
- OH, IT'S NO USE.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.959
WE'RE HORRIBLY OUTNUMBERED.

36:02.026 --> 36:04.795
OR SHOULD I SAY,
YOU'RE HORRIBLY OUTNUMBERED!

36:04.862 --> 36:06.397
I'M SWITCHING
TO THE GNOME TEAM.

36:06.464 --> 36:07.965
HELLO, FELLOW GNOMES.

36:08.032 --> 36:09.934
WHAT SAY WE GO MAKE
SOME TOYS FOR SANTA?

36:11.335 --> 36:13.604
[all screaming]

36:13.671 --> 36:16.240
- BACK OFF,
FREAKY GNOMES.

36:16.307 --> 36:18.276
OR ANSWER
TO TIMMY TURNER,

36:18.342 --> 36:20.945

MAGICAL FAIRIES FOREVER.

I MADE IT SO THAT I COULD HAVE
COSMO, WANDA, AND POOF FOREVER,

BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE
LIFE WITHOUT THEM.

44:30.634 --> 44:34.772
NEVER HUG A GNOME
WITH HEDGE-TRIMMER ARMS...

AND NEVER INVEST
VENTURE CAPITAL

44:36.173 --> 44:38.409
WITHOUT A DETAILED
FIDUCIARY PROSPECTUS.

44:39.977 --> 44:42.646
- SO, WHAT DO YOU WANNA
WISH FOR, SPORT?
