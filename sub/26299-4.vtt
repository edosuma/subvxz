I went to Dylan's house
to tell him it wasn't okay

that we kissed, and I ended up
sleeping with him.

08:10.783 --> 08:12.584
Nothing. Just... Just himself.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.686
[CHUCKLES] I like my chances.

08:14.721 --> 08:16.188
[LAUGHS]

08:16.279 --> 08:17.913
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

08:17.948 --> 08:21.584
I just needed time to process
the whole Dylan thing.

08:21.618 --> 08:24.053
That's totally understandable.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.055
Mom, got it from here.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.923
Of course.

08:27.958 --> 08:29.592
We really got her, huh?

08:29.626 --> 08:30.893
Forgive me. I can't anymore.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.595
- I just... I can't.
- Okay. Okay.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.599
Haley, I need to tell you something.

08:36.633 --> 08:37.967
I transgressed.

08:38.001 --> 08:39.268
You were a woman?

08:39.303 --> 08:40.870
No. No.

08:40.904 --> 08:42.938
After you told me about your kiss, um,

08:42.972 --> 08:46.109
I headed straight to a pub
frequented by other scientists

08:46.143 --> 08:48.478
and, long story short,

08:48.512 --> 08:50.780
I kissed a nuclear physicist.

08:50.814 --> 08:52.448
I know it's not PC to say,

08:52.483 --> 08:55.985
but they really are the loosest
of the scientific disciplines.

08:56.020 --> 08:58.822
- I forgive you.
- Just like that, so fast?

08:58.891 --> 09:00.859
Yeah. Why not? Let's just agree
we're both equally guilty,

09:00.893 --> 09:02.594
move on, and never talk about it again.
[CHUCKLES]

09:02.628 --> 09:04.996
For the record, it could
have gone further.

09:05.031 --> 09:06.831
I-I just want a little credit for that.

09:06.866 --> 09:08.366
Okay.

09:08.401 --> 09:10.035
[WHOOSH, FIRE CRACKLES]

[SULTRY MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO]

09:11.537 --> 09:12.871
Mom!

09:12.905 --> 09:14.005
What?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.707
I do this every day at 3:00.

09:20.582 --> 09:22.450
[SMACKS LIPS] Ah.

09:28.590 --> 09:29.890
Harpo, what are you doing?

09:29.925 --> 09:33.094
Studying you, creating a character.
Imagine I'm not here.

09:33.128 --> 09:35.896
I'm not that creative.
Maybe you could help me.

09:35.931 --> 09:38.733
[LAUGHING] Oh! So gruff. Love it.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.334
- I'm leaving.
- I'm leaving.

09:40.369 --> 09:41.569
Good. You go.

09:41.603 --> 09:45.673

[HISPANIC ACCENT] Look at...
Look at you, <i>mis dos amigos!</i>

09:50.345 --> 09:52.446
[CHUCKLES] That does sound like me.

09:52.481 --> 09:55.082
You're so talented.

09:55.117 --> 09:56.617
Okay, that was strange.

09:56.652 --> 09:58.353
Gloria hates when people imitate her.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.399
And then Gloria says,
"Where are my 'chews'?

10:01.433 --> 10:03.501
I cannot go to the club
without my 'chews.'

That's the money!

10:25.524 --> 10:27.125
How did you know she was doing that?

10:27.159 --> 10:30.225
[NORMAL VOICE] She is so
supportive. It was her idea.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.782
<i>And there it was.</i>

10:31.816 --> 10:34.418
Gloria didn't want that weirdo
here any more than I did.

10:34.452 --> 10:36.420
She just wanted me to be the bad guy.

10:36.454 --> 10:40.290
But the joke's on her, because,
for short bursts of time,

I can be quite nice.

saving up to go there?

11:01.132 --> 11:02.532
What did we end up
blowing that money on?

11:02.567 --> 11:03.700
- Lily.
- Right.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.902
Oh, well, your life sounds so exciting.

- Really?

11:22.120 --> 11:24.054

I'm kind of getting

11:24.088 --> 11:25.789
more low-profile, starter cases.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.153
Uh, I wouldn't worry about that.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.522
There's actually a big case
that I am working on,

There you are!

11:38.399 --> 11:40.567
Hey. Uh, Haley, do you have a sec?

11:40.656 --> 11:43.191
If you don't mind, we were kind of
in the middle of something.

11:43.225 --> 11:45.860
Phil, what are you doing
intruding on these two?

11:45.895 --> 11:47.028

11:47.062 --> 11:48.696
I just need to show Haley
something in my office.

11:48.731 --> 11:50.198
I was doing a little cleaning,
and I came across

11:50.232 --> 11:53.201
this old doll that used to
mean a lot to her.

11:53.235 --> 11:55.537
Can't you just get rid of the doll?

11:55.571 --> 11:57.038
I started to,
but it really seems like

11:57.072 --> 11:59.441
something you should do,
you know, for closure.

12:00.848 --> 12:01.981
You're right.

12:02.016 --> 12:04.250
Wait. You need closure from a doll?

12:04.285 --> 12:05.618
That seems odd.

12:05.653 --> 12:07.816
Well, I did sleep with that
thing since I was like 16.

12:07.851 --> 12:10.051
- 16?
- 16?

12:10.086 --> 12:11.124
Oh, no.

12:13.828 --> 12:16.429
What is Dylan doing here?

12:16.463 --> 12:17.764
He's making a grand gesture.

12:17.798 --> 12:19.465
He won't leave until he talks to Haley.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.601
Oh, my God. It was one kiss.

12:21.635 --> 12:23.937
[CHUCKLING] Poor, naive Claire.

12:23.971 --> 12:25.338
It was <i>two</i> kisses.

12:25.372 --> 12:26.639
You have something to do with this?

12:26.674 --> 12:27.941
Haley was ghosting him.

12:27.975 --> 12:30.777
- What does that mean?
- You are so not hip.

12:30.811 --> 12:32.111
She wouldn't call him back,

12:32.146 --> 12:34.147
so I told her to do
the right thing and end it,

12:34.181 --> 12:35.949
or whatever, in person.

12:35.983 --> 12:37.484
"Or whatever"? No "or whatever."

12:37.557 --> 12:39.925
She's been "or whatever-ing"
since puberty.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.595
It is time for her to grow up.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.229
Doesn't matter. Look, we both want

12:44.264 --> 12:46.031
the same thing for her in the end.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.266
- Absolutely.
- Right.

12:47.270 --> 12:48.270
For her to make her own decision.

12:48.371 --> 12:50.539
Of course. The only decision is...

12:50.573 --> 12:53.175
- Arvin.
- I agree. Arvin is very impressive.

12:53.209 --> 12:55.010
Buyou should know Dylan has been

12:55.044 --> 12:56.912
putting himself through nursing school,

12:56.946 --> 13:00.048
working at the hospital, running.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.850
You're not honestly making
a case for that guy?

13:01.884 --> 13:03.685
That guy would take a bullet for Haley.

13:03.719 --> 13:05.187
Why are you so invested in him?

13:05.221 --> 13:06.388
Because I was that guy!

13:06.422 --> 13:08.557
I was the underdog with
every girl I ever liked.

13:08.591 --> 13:10.525
[SIGHS] That's very sweet.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.027
But this isn't about you.

13:12.061 --> 13:14.029
This is about Haley

13:14.063 --> 13:17.632
being with a respected,
charming scientist

13:17.667 --> 13:20.769
versus a guy who Lily convinced
to eat a box of crayons.

13:20.803 --> 13:22.137
It was one bite out of one crayon.

13:22.171 --> 13:23.505
It was only because he was blindfolded

13:23.539 --> 13:25.640
- and trapped in a Chese finger puzzle.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.444

but can we please do this another time?

13:31.481 --> 13:33.915
I won't have the costume
another time, Haley.

13:33.950 --> 13:38.086
So, this is the doll you slept with.

Hey, you're pretty handsome yourself.

13:41.909 --> 13:44.068
So many questions.

First, why have you snuck 'round to see

13:46.897 --> 13:50.033
the bloke you supposedly
feel terrible about kissing?

13:50.067 --> 13:52.636
Yo, I hope this doesn't sound
braggy, but for the most part,

13:52.654 --> 13:55.122
people do not feel terrible
about kissing me.

13:55.157 --> 13:56.624
Okay, guys, stop.

13:56.658 --> 13:59.627
Listen to me, my simple friend.

13:59.661 --> 14:02.296
I just spent 14 hours in a middle seat.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.298
I suggest you get out of my space.

14:04.332 --> 14:07.301
Well, I suggest, next time,
you ask about an exit row.

14:07.335 --> 14:09.494
It could still be a middle seat,
but you'd have more leg room.

14:10.143 --> 14:11.443
You have to go!

- Radiant as ever, Mrs. D.
- Ugh.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.457
Haley, tell him to leave.

14:25.492 --> 14:27.159
Let me see if I can defuse
the situation.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.940
We are so, so sorry.

14:40.974 --> 14:42.108

Can we fix it?

14:48.816 --> 14:50.450
Oh, I don't know.
Do you happen to have any clay

14:50.484 --> 14:52.118
from the melted runoff of Kilimanjaro?

14:52.152 --> 14:53.453
Because that's what it's made of!

14:53.487 --> 14:55.321
We got it on our first trip to Tanzania.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.989
It was blessed by the shaman
that healed his psoriasis.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.857
Of course we'll be happy
to pay to replace it.

14:59.892 --> 15:01.325
- It's irreplaceable!

- Oh.

15:05.297 --> 15:07.599
We cannot apologize enough.

15:07.633 --> 15:08.933
That's probably true.

15:08.968 --> 15:11.102
I'll go get lunch.

15:11.137 --> 15:12.270
Okay, this is a disaster.

I know, but is any part of you
still hearing

15:14.306 --> 15:15.774
"first trip to Tanzania"?

15:15.808 --> 15:17.609
He was just about to offer me
the case I want.

15:17.643 --> 15:18.643
Well, there'll be other cases.

15:18.677 --> 15:20.612
No. This one involves a music producer,

15:20.646 --> 15:22.180
an escort, and illegal arms sales, okay?

15:22.209 --> 15:23.976
I want to bring them to justice.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.311
Plus, they've already
sold the movie rights.

Hurry, before they come back.
I'm gonna tell them

15:38.315 --> 15:39.815
the dog did it.
It'll cancel out the mask.

15:39.850 --> 15:41.817
Just do it.

15:41.852 --> 15:42.952
Harder. It needs to scar me.

15:42.986 --> 15:44.453
It's definitely scarring me.

They need to believe a dog did it.

you're gonna make us wait
so long to eat,

this shouldn't come as a surprise.

16:00.872 --> 16:01.872
Now, check this out.

16:01.906 --> 16:03.840
I can throw anything at her,

16:03.875 --> 16:06.510
and she can make comedy gold out of it.

16:12.216 --> 16:14.050
Ow! Ow!

16:14.052 --> 16:15.552
Yeah, because a submarine is small.

16:15.586 --> 16:18.889
[LAUGHS]
You were right, Gloria. She's hilarious.

It's hard to spike with little arms.

16:30.387 --> 16:32.688
Jay, can I talk to you
in there for a second?

16:32.722 --> 16:35.324
Yeah, yeah. All right.
I'll be right back.

16:35.384 --> 16:36.684
What a hoot!

16:36.718 --> 16:38.186
What is your game, old man?

16:38.220 --> 16:39.854
Nothing. I'm loving this.

16:39.888 --> 16:42.690
My only fear is that she might
hit it big and leave us.

16:42.724 --> 16:46.027
You think I'm an idiot?
Nobody thinks that that is funny.

16:46.061 --> 16:48.696
Be honest, you want her out
of here more than I do.

Okay, fine, but I don't want
to be the mother

16:50.732 --> 16:52.700
that hates her son's girlfriend.

16:52.734 --> 16:54.035
I don't want to be the villain anymore.

But that's your job.
I am the quiet and fun one.

16:57.739 --> 17:00.041
Have you not heard her
impression of you? It's dead-on.

17:00.076 --> 17:01.710
You want to get rid of her, you do it.

17:01.744 --> 17:04.045
I won't have to, because I can pretend

17:04.079 --> 17:07.082
that I like Sherry longer than you can.

17:07.116 --> 17:09.217
You will crack first.

17:09.251 --> 17:10.885
[HISPANIC ACCENT] You will crack first!

17:10.920 --> 17:13.054
Sherry, you cannot stay here.

17:13.089 --> 17:14.356
[NORMAL VOICE] What? Why?

17:14.414 --> 17:16.714
Because you're driving me crazy.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.050
But I thought you liked me.

- Hey, I'm back! Guess what.

17:23.256 --> 17:25.089
All that calligraphy I've done
for the dean paid off.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.134
He said you can stay with me.

[VOICE BREAKING]
Your mom just told me she hates me.

Mom, why would you say that?

17:31.741 --> 17:33.108
And scene!

17:34.510 --> 17:36.311
Why can't I tell Dylan to leave?

17:36.345 --> 17:38.313
Because you are scared

17:38.347 --> 17:41.149
of the first real, adult relationship

17:41.184 --> 17:44.186
with the perfect man,
and you're clinging to the past.

How am I supposed to choose?
How did you guys do it?

17:54.864 --> 17:57.599
Well, sweetheart, I...
I'm not gonna be any help here.

17:57.691 --> 18:00.493
From the minute I met your mom,
there was no choice.

18:00.527 --> 18:03.028
She was smart.
She was strong.

18:03.063 --> 18:05.664
She resented her father just
enough to go for a guy like me.

18:05.699 --> 18:08.367
She... She gave my life balance,

18:08.401 --> 18:10.336
and now I can't imagine it without her.

18:10.370 --> 18:13.473
Also, she's... she's crazy hot.

18:13.507 --> 18:16.109
- Mom?
- Well, first of all, um,

18:16.143 --> 18:19.779
I'm a sucker for guys
who say things like that.

18:19.813 --> 18:22.615
Your dad is the nicest,
most positive person I know,

and he always helps me find
the fun in life.

18:24.985 --> 18:28.121
And, uh, he is still real easy
on the peepers.

[LAUGHING] I forgot what
we were even fighting about.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.661
Me too.

18:34.695 --> 18:36.529
You weren't fighting. We were
talking about my problem.

18:36.564 --> 18:38.225
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, honey,

18:38.250 --> 18:40.251
you should probably just
ignore eveyothing we said

18:40.285 --> 18:43.588

with each of them.

Of course not.
