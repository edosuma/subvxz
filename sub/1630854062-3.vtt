00:06.172 --> 00:08.508
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:08.591 --> 00:11.886
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:21.438 --> 00:24.149
A follower in Daegu
sends these to me every month.

00:24.232 --> 00:27.569
This batch is particularly crunchy
and sweet too.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.029
Try some.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.741
Just cut to the chase.
I came here on business.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.786
Your soul is angry, Brother Kang.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.164
Calm down and relax a little.

00:39.664 --> 00:43.293
I'd like to see you calm down
if you'd lost your fortune,

00:43.376 --> 00:46.046
and been sent to prison
for a crime you didn't commit.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.048
Would you be able to relax?

00:49.090 --> 00:50.842
And…

00:51.468 --> 00:53.386
why did you have to kill Eungsoo?

00:56.014 --> 00:58.558
It's hard to accept
that God's plan involves the death

00:58.641 --> 01:00.310
of the ones we love, isn't it?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.521
You're so full of shit.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.273
That makes no sense.

01:10.945 --> 01:14.199
I think the point of our conversation
was to find out why you came back here.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.950
Forget about your friend and answer me.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.411
I wanna know why you're not back in Korea.
Let's hear it.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.913
You bankrupted us.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.706
Our money's all gone.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.502
I intend to make money before I go.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.670
I'm just going to be trading cocaine
instead of skate.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.714
The cops throw you in jail

01:29.798 --> 01:31.549
and now you decide
you want to be a drug lord?

01:31.633 --> 01:35.345
I can't go back to Korea
with nothing to give to my kids.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.473
This shit is the result
of some overzealous asshole screwing me.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.267
The only decision I made
was to try to survive.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.442
Oh, thank you, Marina.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.867
Cocaine sure can make someone rich.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.914
It's just to move product out of Suriname
you need my resources.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.335
Chen Zhen has his own resources.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.171
Turns out Mr. Hot Pot
is a bit of a dealer too.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.716
And he doesn't hide behind bibles
and bullshit. He's a straight shooter.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.053
Chen Zhen deals meth, not cocaine.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.890
The crap he sells in synthetic.
Nothing in meth is of God's making.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.058
It's like Satan's phlegm.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.309
But cocaine…

02:24.227 --> 02:27.689
is a true gift of nature
sent by the Savior for us.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.984
Anyone who wants this special gift
in all of Suriname

02:31.067 --> 02:32.527
comes through the pastor.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.530
Pastor, my ass. Anyway, I don't need you.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.532
Chen Zhen can supply me all the product.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.705
You actually think
that punk can play at this level?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.920
The meth market
is nothing like the cocaine market.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.255
He won't get you shit.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.758
Anything he showed you
was scraped together from my network.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.679
If you pay retail, it'll cost you.
You'll barely have a dime left over.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.268
Hmm.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.154
Hmm?

03:16.237 --> 03:18.323
If you work
with that small-time meth dealer,

03:18.406 --> 03:20.742
all you'll ship to Korea is his junk.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.744
And there's no way
you'll make a decent margin.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.537
Forget him.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.916
I'm giving you cold, hard facts.
I don't lie about numbers.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.881
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, Sangman?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.592
<i> Ingu. What's up, man?</i>
<i>How's the food over there?</i>

05:02.093 --> 05:03.720
<i>Your Chinese buddy feeding you all right?</i>

05:03.803 --> 05:06.347
I would've never imagined
people could have such strange appetites.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.017
I think we could have
a diplomatic conflict on our hands.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.810
We can never agree on lunch.

05:10.893 --> 05:14.105
We've been in conflict with China
for at least 5,000 years, remember?

05:14.188 --> 05:16.524
You can't expect to fix that
with a take-out menu.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.401
Fight over money, not food.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.694
Oh yeah, sure.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.863
But I'm fighting <i>for </i>money, not over it.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.782
I found someone
who distributes what we're looking for.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.285
He's a fellow Korean.
He's with me right now.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.120
<i>I think you should talk.</i>

05:30.079 --> 05:31.998
All right, sure. Go ahead. Put him on.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.499
All yours.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.756
Sangman, is it?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.842
This is Pastor Jeon.
I run a church here in Suriname.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.761
Glad to hear it, Pastor Jeon.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.347
It's always good to have
the same interests in both business,

05:47.430 --> 05:49.599
and our religious pursuits.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.184
I work for my church as well.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.020
<i>God's call can not be ignored, can it?</i>

05:55.563 --> 05:57.899
It certainly can't. Amen to that.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.151
I would love to continue
on this spiritual exploration,

06:00.234 --> 06:01.694
but I have questions.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.820
Lots of them.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.283
The first one being how can you guarantee
the goods traveling from here to Korea

06:07.367 --> 06:08.659
won't be intercepted?

06:09.660 --> 06:13.998
Ah. Surely you understand
that I can't reveal my inner operations.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.334
However, what I can tell you…

06:18.044 --> 06:20.797
…is that US forces in Korea
eat boat loads of chicken,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.466
and that around 60% of it
gets imported from Brazil.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.843
<i>If the merchandise travels</i>
<i>with the chicken,</i>

06:25.927 --> 06:29.555
<i>it'll go straight to Itaewon and Gangnam</i>
<i>without any customs inspection.</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:41.067
Your plan definitely sounds intriguing,

06:41.943 --> 06:46.656
but I think conversations of this nature
are best conducted in person. Don't you?

06:47.323 --> 06:48.533
Let's arrange a meeting soon.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.743
These things
are best discussed face-to-face.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.752
<i> Great minds</i>
<i>think alike, Pastor Jeon.</i>

06:59.836 --> 07:03.131
I prefer meeting in person,
only I'm booked solid now.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.342
I don't have time to fly to Suriname.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.469
Would you be able
to meet me here in Brazil?

07:08.553 --> 07:10.847
You can be sure
I would make it worth your while

07:10.930 --> 07:12.098
for you to come down.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.267
It's a fun place to do business.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.277
I do like that area.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.988
I'm overdue for a change
of scene and fresh air,

07:27.071 --> 07:28.656
only I have church services.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.951
And my loyal congregation really expects
to see me there, you know?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.874
Uh-huh. I understand.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.128
And I try to put my service to the church
on the same pedestal.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.671
Forgive my transgression, Pastor.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.506
Is it at all possible
to free up a few days

07:45.590 --> 07:47.133
to come visit us instead?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.438
Where there's a will,
there's a way, Pastor.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.397
Sorry?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.983
I'll cancel a few things on my schedule.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.652
It's only right I come to you.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.237
I'll advise you of when I can be there.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.615
Hallelujah!

08:10.698 --> 08:13.034
God would approve.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.246
Give Ingu all the details of your arrival,
then I'll show you how we do business.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.502
Hey, Sangman.
You're coming here? Did I hear right?

08:22.585 --> 08:24.170
<i>Don't sound so surprised.</i>

08:24.253 --> 08:26.589
<i>Hey, remember what I said.</i>
<i>Anything to make this work, man.</i>

08:26.672 --> 08:27.882
<i>What's one short flight?</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:31.052
I just need to change my schedule around
for a few days.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.386
I'll be in touch.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.890
Okay. I suggest you eat
your entire in-flight meal on the way.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.019
So since we're face-to-face
with each other right now,

08:40.102 --> 08:41.521
let's get one thing settled.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.816
I say we just split 50-50 down the middle.
Half and half, okay?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.569
Brother Kang,

08:49.278 --> 08:51.656
there's a passage in James 1:15.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.658
"When desire is conceived
to bringeth forth sin."

08:53.741 --> 08:56.827
"And sin when accomplished,
will bringeth forth death."

08:57.578 --> 09:00.081
Seventy-thirty. No problem.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.165
That's the cut.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.959
That's a joke.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.752
Who would agree to that deal?

09:04.835 --> 09:06.170
Stop wasting my time, huh?

09:08.839 --> 09:11.384
Don't you know greed is a deadly sin?

09:11.467 --> 09:12.843
It's the path I was shown.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.644
I suggest we review this
when your friend arrives.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.199
Listen, boss.
This wasn't in the plan at all.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.244
If for some reason
they find out who you are,

09:38.828 --> 09:39.996
we have to pull the plug.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.331
If I don't go, it's dead in the water.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.543
This way, I can see
this asshole's face in person

09:45.626 --> 09:46.836
and see what we're up against.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.880
This has been going on for years.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.466
I need to breathe the same air
as this guy at least once.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.682
Let's get me on a plane.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.082
INCOMING CALL
KANG THE PROFESSIONAL

10:26.292 --> 10:28.794
Ingu, what's going on?
Had any decent food lately?

10:28.878 --> 10:31.839
<i> I'm currently stuffing my face</i>
<i>at the hotel breakfast bar.</i>

10:31.922 --> 10:33.424
<i>What time is your flight?</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:36.594
9:30. I was just about
to call you about that.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.180
We can talk about dealing with the pastor
at the airport.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.723
<i>That's not gonna happen.</i>

10:40.806 --> 10:42.933
<i>I won't be the one</i>
<i>picking you up at the airport.</i>

10:43.434 --> 10:45.186
<i>The pastor's sending</i>
<i>his team out to get you.</i>

10:45.269 --> 10:46.771
<i>He told me not to bother.</i>

10:47.271 --> 10:48.898
<i>I'm not sure what to make of it.</i>

10:50.274 --> 10:51.817
Did he tell you anything else?

10:52.401 --> 10:55.529
<i>Something along the lines of</i>
<i>things getting complicated if I was there.</i>

10:55.613 --> 10:57.657
<i>Anyway, have a safe flight.</i>

10:58.240 --> 11:00.910
Thanks. Don't eat too much at the buffet.
You'll get sick.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.205
<i>And one more thing.</i>
<i>Remember the pastor promised you a party.</i>

11:04.288 --> 11:07.708
<i>I suggest you pay particular attention</i>
<i>to how you present yourself.</i>

11:07.792 --> 11:10.127
<i>You're a big talker</i>
<i>in an underground business.</i>

11:10.211 --> 11:13.631
<i>You might not wanna show up</i>
<i>looking like you work in an office.</i>

11:13.714 --> 11:17.760
You're right. That's an excellent point.
I'll pick my outfits accordingly, okay?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.721
<i>Eye on the prize.</i>
<i>Right, Sangman? I'll see you.</i>

11:20.805 --> 11:21.722
Yep.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.536
JOHAN ADOLF PENGEL INT'L AIRPORT
SURINAME

11:53.546 --> 11:54.422
How are you, Mr. Goo?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.675
I'm the pastor's legal advisor,
David Julio Park. But call me David.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.760
This is Lee Sangjun, our deacon.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.346
I appreciate the seller welcome committee.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.100
Quite a pair, the smiling shark
and the quiet clerk.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.983
I'll need your passport.
We have an arrangement with the guards.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.609
It's super fast-track.

12:16.527 --> 12:20.197
Oh. Arrangements with guards
are so handy. So expedient.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.374
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.419
Salute!

12:58.444 --> 13:00.863
Show him a good time, girls.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.491
Make yourself comfortable, daddy.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.618
Whoa.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.786
Fast-track, indeed.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.326
Ingu. Good to see you, brother.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.246
Food here's treating you all right?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.706
Not really. I find the food way too salty.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.959
Oh, this is our host Pastor Jeon.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.335
This is Goo Sangman.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.879
It's an honor to meet such
a devout servant of the people.

13:58.963 --> 13:59.797
Thanks for having me.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.675
Hallelujah!

14:02.758 --> 14:05.803
I feel like it must've been a good flight
seeing as you're on the wings of God.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.181
-Would you like a drink?
-Yeah.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.227
You'll have to come visit me in Brazil
when you have a chance.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.605
It's a great place to release tension.
Like your limo.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.107
As a church leader,

14:18.190 --> 14:20.651
I must abstain from
some types of indulgence.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.320
-Ah.
-Although, it's very tempting sometimes.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.077
The GDP of countries in Northeast Asia

14:30.160 --> 14:32.830
has shown growth in conjuction
with China's meteoric rise.

14:32.913 --> 14:33.914
And as you know,

14:33.998 --> 14:36.917
a rise in spending power generates
an increase in demand for narcotics.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.086
Mm-hmm. Thankfully.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.465
However, our research
has always shown that

14:43.549 --> 14:45.426
Korean's aren't overly fond of powder.

14:45.509 --> 14:49.096
That's entirely because the quality
of the cocaine on the market is shit.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.016
However, we do have
a special fondness for luxury goods

14:52.099 --> 14:54.101
such as Chanel, Mercedes-Benz,
and other top brands.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.145
We don't mind paying
for top-of-the-line products.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.818
Pastor, it's Colombian coke's time
to meet Korea.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.946
I think we should take the market by storm
right off the bat.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.991
We get our product to Korea, China,
and Japan in one shot.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.618
A synchronized regional launch.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.375
Well…

15:19.752 --> 15:21.170
China's a long shot.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.214
In my experience, the opium wars
are still fresh. They were traumatizing.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.967
I think killing
counters serious resistance.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.171
You should have a rest.
I'm sure your flight was tiring.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.466
Uh, I'm fine. I always fly first-class.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.095
I must be getting old.
Flying makes me weary.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.138
Preacher.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.140
Please take these gentleman

16:15.849 --> 16:17.643
to the best room in the guest house.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.186
Right away, sir.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.799
<i>…284 this year, a home run, and 7 RBI's.</i>

16:52.302 --> 16:53.345
Show our guests in.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.493
Enjoy your rest.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.517
<i>This is the best room?</i>
<i>I can't see out the fucking window.</i>

17:40.601 --> 17:41.477
<i>I know.</i>

17:41.560 --> 17:43.937
<i> I don't like it.</i>
<i>I feel like we're being locked up.</i>

17:44.021 --> 17:47.357
<i> What are you? Claustrophobic?</i>
<i>I'm sure it's just to keep the heat out.</i>

17:53.530 --> 17:55.574
Something stinks.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.538
I don't like it, boss.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.730
Did you get to rest up?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.358
Yes. I like the dark.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.485
Your decorator's good.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.542
While you slept,
I did a bit of research on you.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.461
Two years ago,

18:50.796 --> 18:53.048
you came to Suriname for the first time.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.509
What was that trip for?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.562
I've been here before.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.565
Looking to export cocaine to Korea.

19:10.065 --> 19:13.277
I struck out every avenue I went down,
so I gave up and I left.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.113
The timing's right.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.116
That's when you got a hold
of me and Eungsoo

19:19.199 --> 19:21.702
and told us about the skate opportunity.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.954
Which, as we all know,
died an early death.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.924
You say you were looking for cocaine,
but you visited the American embassy.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.217
Why is that?

19:40.137 --> 19:43.473
That would be like a burglar
trying to break into the police station.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.155
Spit it out, man. Would you?
I have other things to do.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.949
So tell me a lie, tell me the truth,
tell me any damn thing.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.794
I had a connection.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.298
Someone turned me on
to one of the employees

20:16.381 --> 20:17.424
with a little side hustle.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.509
They said the guy could get you
anything you want

20:19.593 --> 20:21.261
and in whatever amount you wanted.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.305
Only this asshole…

20:25.432 --> 20:28.477
This asshole was up to his Yankee eyeballs
in debt with some Chinese gang,

20:28.560 --> 20:30.395
and he refused
to meet outside the embassy.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.813
He was too scared to meet outside.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.567
Turns out he was a two-bit hustler
who only dealt meth and weed.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.236
I walked out on his sorry ass.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.445
What's this guy's name?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.659
Douglas Harper, I think.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.579
Hey, Preacher.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.208
You were still slumming
with that fool Chen Zhen two years ago.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.543
Does Douglas Harper ring a bell?

20:59.007 --> 21:00.842
The meth and the gambling,

21:01.343 --> 21:03.929
so many drugged up idiots
gambling away their money.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.139
I can't remember them all.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.350
We got lots of Yanks, though.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.895
Hang on. This is bullshit.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.357
We didn't come here to do business
like a bunch of low-level gangsters.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.610
This isn't professional.
We can't work this way.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.951
This is my house, so we do things my way.
Understood?

21:28.495 --> 21:31.581
I want the real fucking story,
or I'll get it out of you the hard way.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.334
This whole thing sounds suspicious.

21:34.418 --> 21:38.088
And your disrespect is obnoxious.
So fuck you and your bullshit operation.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.299
Amateur hour's over.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.012
No one leaves before the Pastor
gives his blessing, so sit back down.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.931
-Blessing, my ass!
-Hey, hey! Chill, Sangman.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.766
Cool it. Take it down a few notches.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.019
Calm down.
I'm sure he didn't mean to insult you.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.563
Screw that, Ingu.
I should be ripping you a new one.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.898
The thing I despise most
is wasting time and money.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.610
And that's all I've done since I met
this imposter and his trained monkeys.

22:03.613 --> 22:06.283
Hey, what's going on? What's the count?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.870
No outs. They walked the first batter,
and the next one hit a double.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.664
Ah! Son of a bitch!

22:19.421 --> 22:22.716
<i>Park was able to get Church</i>
<i>to bounce into a 3-6-1 double play</i>

22:22.799 --> 22:25.135
<i>in the first inning,</i>
<i>to get out of that inning.</i>

22:25.218 --> 22:27.888
<i>And allowed two runs</i>
<i>and a home run by Murphy.</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:31.558
That's it! That's it! That's it!

22:32.642 --> 22:35.479
Just get one more strike
and we're good, Chanho. Huh?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.483
Chanho Park is Korea's
number one baseball ambassador.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.985
We need to show him our support.

22:42.652 --> 22:45.614
Now, come on and serve that curveball.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.831
Douglas Harper, was it?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.126
Why don't you enjoy America's pastime

22:58.210 --> 22:59.878
while we check out
the American drug dealer?

23:03.632 --> 23:06.635
It's always good business
to vet partners before you get started.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.429
I could go home.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.681
Get some work done while we're waiting.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.975
Who are you to tell me to sit tight?

23:15.477 --> 23:17.229
Not a sports guy?

23:17.312 --> 23:19.064
Do what you want,
but you can't leave Suriname

23:19.147 --> 23:20.148
without my say.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.275
Preacher!

23:23.235 --> 23:25.779
-Take them to a hotel.
-Right away.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.741
Chanho! Yes!

23:29.825 --> 23:31.118
Strike out!

23:31.201 --> 23:32.285
Yeah!

23:32.369 --> 23:37.416
You're an animal.
I told you to use the curve!

23:37.499 --> 23:39.626
Awesome!

23:39.709 --> 23:40.669
David.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.630
I need you to keep an eye on those two.

23:43.713 --> 23:46.883
And see if there's a record
for Douglas Harper at the embassy.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.179
You want us to get access
to their employee files?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.056
This is the US Embassy
we're talking about.

23:58.019 --> 24:01.148
It's a government agency. You can bribe
your way through the front or back door.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.108
Whichever it is, get it done today.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.820
Hey, David.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.199
I'm not asking. This is an order.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.286
Yes, sir.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.297
So you think
the situation is salvageable?

25:07.380 --> 25:09.925
I mean, I assume the NIS
would give you a clean cover.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.469
What you told me about Jeon
being thorough and suspicious

25:12.552 --> 25:13.762
was confirmed on the ground.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.764
If I showed up with a clean passport,

25:15.847 --> 25:18.767
the conversation would've ended there.
He wouldn't sell to us.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.061
Are you telling me you made up that trail
for him to follow?

25:21.144 --> 25:22.521
No, I just didn't erase it.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.898
There was a Douglas Harper
working at the US Embassy.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.733
He was under surveillance
for drug dealing.

25:26.816 --> 25:27.817
If they take the bait,

25:27.901 --> 25:30.362
it'll be easy for you
to get the pastor to trust you.

25:31.154 --> 25:34.533
All right. I still think you should've
thought to mention what you were planning

25:34.616 --> 25:36.785
before you forced me
to go along with this.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.914
I really thought
it was gonna go sideways for a minute.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.460
I have to adjust
to the adversary's tactics sometimes.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.462
It's a big boy's arena.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.547
However, I can assure you

25:48.630 --> 25:50.715
that all variables
are controlled by the department.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.135
The department that recruited
the former owner of a karaoke bar

25:54.219 --> 25:55.595
for a cocaine sting?

26:42.475 --> 26:44.811
<i>You haven't called. Why is that?</i>

26:45.437 --> 26:48.106
<i>It's been five hours, David.</i>
<i>What the fuck?</i>

26:48.189 --> 26:50.066
Still waiting, sir.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.776
David, they played us.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.529
Cut the bullshit
and get rid of these clowns.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.031
We've wasted enough time.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.658
I know, Pastor.
I just think we should wait.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.245
Hotels tend to get a lot of press
when their guests get murdered.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.413
<i> True.</i>

27:03.496 --> 27:07.292
But, counselor, let me worry about that,
and do what I tell you.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.306
We'll be in and out of there
in no time, Pastor.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.900
Kill all the security cameras
in the hotel.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.902
And keep your mouths shut.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.685
Hey.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.561
You left without this.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.398
I thought you weren't coming.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.649
What took you so long?

28:12.732 --> 28:16.486
You think getting the staff roster
at the US Embassy is so easy?

28:27.997 --> 28:30.709
<i>The CIA agent we used to work with</i>
<i>introduced me to this guy.</i>

28:30.792 --> 28:33.044
<i>I know the information's solid.</i>

28:33.128 --> 28:36.047
<i>Douglas Harper's listed</i>
<i>on the embassy personnel roster.</i>

28:36.131 --> 28:40.051
<i>And his performance reviews mention</i>
<i>drugs, gambling, and debts.</i>

28:59.988 --> 29:01.865
PASTOR JEON

29:04.701 --> 29:05.785
Jeon's calling.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.126
<i>Brother Kang.</i>

29:14.377 --> 29:16.713
I have excellent news for you.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.097
Ah!

29:41.154 --> 29:42.238
Stop, stop!

29:53.458 --> 29:55.251
I was surprised to hear from you.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.630
When you checked out to watch the game,
I took it as a sign you don't need money.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.840
Or do you make money
betting on baseball too?

30:00.924 --> 30:04.344
You don't understand what it means
to be a die-hard fan, Sangman.

30:04.427 --> 30:07.013
You'd rather starve
than miss a single strike.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.557
You have to respect the passion, though.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.811
Ah, it is that.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.896
I do admit I went a bit overboard.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.898
So to make it up to you…

30:16.981 --> 30:19.150
…it's game on.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.153
I'll get you two tons
as your first shipment.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.825
Two tons?

30:28.159 --> 30:31.246
It works <i>if</i> you can get the merchandise
to a designated meeting point

30:31.329 --> 30:32.580
we can agree on.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.540
Near Brazil's border.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.500
Sure. No problem.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.795
Now I'm gonna need
some time to bundle everything.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.547
The Colombians will send it in bulk.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.925
Then we make you
nice and tidy packages for shipping. Hmm?

30:46.469 --> 30:48.263
Two tons will take about a month.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.681
That's 30 days.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.520
I'm cutting it close,
but that's just in time for the boat.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.896
Ball.

30:58.773 --> 30:59.691
So,

31:01.651 --> 31:03.820
now that the logistics are worked out,

31:03.903 --> 31:05.947
I want to know
how you're planning to pay.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.120
What I propose is this.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.998
You import it from Colombia first, right?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.877
We need to inspect it
on arrival, of course.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.046
I need to get back to Brazil,
so Brother Kang will do that here.

31:22.130 --> 31:25.133
If it's all good,
I wire you a deposit on the spot.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.176
Sure.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.012
That sounds good.

31:29.095 --> 31:29.929
We have a deal.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.891
Yeah, looks like we do.

31:34.017 --> 31:34.851
Ball.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.396
Oh.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.858
I consulted God about your share.

31:41.941 --> 31:44.736
He says I can't allow more than 60-40.

31:44.819 --> 31:45.820
Ha.

31:47.363 --> 31:50.116
Okay, Pastor. You talk to God,
we'll work out the details.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.871
It'll be nice to get my hands
on some decent money again.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.501
Ooh! Oh! Nice throw!

32:00.585 --> 32:03.713
-Yeah, you've tossed a few pitches before.
-Yeah.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.381
Let's all have dinner.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.091
We need to celebrate.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.217
I could eat.

32:08.885 --> 32:09.719
Sure.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.086
I was thinking
that before you go,

32:43.169 --> 32:45.672
you could get me in touch
with a local agent.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.298
So I have a contact here.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.849
-Yeah?
-I know, a bit different.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.601
-Did you?
-Huh?

32:58.685 --> 33:00.520
Did you like
the texture of this one?

33:02.188 --> 33:04.107
Mmm, actually…

33:05.733 --> 33:08.069
In our line of work,
it's too risky for both parties

33:08.152 --> 33:09.487
to know their fellow agents.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.990
Huh? I'm one of you?

33:13.324 --> 33:14.742
That's not what I meant.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.495
You're better off not knowing. Trust me.

33:18.121 --> 33:18.955
Hold on.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.249
You throw the word trust around
like it's small change.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.001
How do you expect me
to trust you, Sangman?

33:23.084 --> 33:24.585
So far, you're all talk.

33:27.213 --> 33:29.632
Hey, they have steak tartare over there.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.846
I hope you like it.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.933
The chefs are top notch.
They're good with Korean patrons.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.353
I heard you like Korean tartare,
so I had them make it for you.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.022
Oh, you shouldn't have.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.524
Don't get me wrong, it's good.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.402
It's a bit spongy on the tongue
for my taste.

33:49.485 --> 33:51.988
I hear American meat
is full of hormones, so…

33:52.071 --> 33:53.197
Hmm.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.033
I think it's the marble texture
of the beef

33:55.116 --> 33:58.411
that allows it to melt in your mouth
if you eat more slowly.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.579
Try it again.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.373
Mmm.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.501
Brother Kang.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.419
Yes.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.050
We agreed to a very lucrative deal
with you and your partner today.

34:12.133 --> 34:15.678
Since he needs to leave, I was thinking
you might enjoy the company of my house.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.597
Why pay for a hotel room?

34:21.225 --> 34:22.060
Ha.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.103
Hotels have windows you can see out of.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.772
I'm fine where I am, thanks.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.399
Ah, this is different.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.987
I thought we could watch baseball together
as you seem to appreciate Park's talent.

34:33.946 --> 34:36.783
We're alike.
We could become very good friends.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.659
We already have something in common.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.912
Synergy is the key to success, Ingu.

34:41.871 --> 34:42.705
Mm-hmm.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.415
Funny.

34:44.499 --> 34:46.250
I thought we were like night and day.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.759
I know we can get along just fine.
Trust me on this one.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.260
I'll treat you right.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.013
Since I first met you
and saw you living in that dump,

34:59.097 --> 35:01.808
it's made my heart sorry for you.

35:02.683 --> 35:03.518
Wow.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.437
I imagine your heart
must really bleed then.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.980
For ruining my livelihood.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.948
I suffered hardship from that too.

35:18.991 --> 35:21.994
It was an unfortunate consequence.
It was not my intention.

35:30.878 --> 35:32.797
A car will pick you up tomorrow.

36:36.652 --> 36:40.281
For the pastor to get two tons of cocaine
delivered from Colombia in one shot,

36:40.364 --> 36:43.451
he's gonna have to come up
with a lot more than he's used to.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.786
If he stretches himself thin,
we can use that.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.876
Ugh.

36:58.257 --> 37:01.677
You know, I've been wandering
how shipments get through inspection.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.304
In our case,

37:03.846 --> 37:08.017
how is it that Dutch customs decided
to do an inspection on our skate that day?

37:11.395 --> 37:13.397
When I was in prison,
the inmates all agreed.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.817
The odds of customs searching
that shipment without a tip-off

37:16.901 --> 37:18.778
was something like a thousand to one.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.658
Until you forced me to work with the NIS,

37:23.741 --> 37:26.244
I just thought that Eungsoo and I
had really rotten luck.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.835
Now I think…

37:36.170 --> 37:38.881
you guys already had
the pastor in your sights.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.258
Huh?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.302
And <i>you</i> called in the tip about the drugs.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.640
I've looked at it from every angle,
and nothing else makes sense.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.687
I'm right.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.690
And you've known all along.

37:55.773 --> 37:59.151
This is how you do it? Ruin people's lives
and force them to work for you?

38:00.069 --> 38:02.530
Jeon's cocaine couldn't enter Korea
with your merchandise.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.740
We had to seize the goods.
You got caught in the middle.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.951
Don't you hear yourself? You did this!

38:07.034 --> 38:09.787
You could've intercepted the coke
before the pastor came anywhere close.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.580
You people screwed me on purpose.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.291
Eungsoo and I
put our life savings in this.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.167
Now I learn
my own government fucked us.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.335
Ingu.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.880
We work for the greater good
of our people.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.216
Sometimes that means
sacrificing individuals for national--

38:22.300 --> 38:25.011
Enough bullshit.
National interest? Really?

38:25.094 --> 38:26.762
How is this helping the nation?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.180
Ruining lives?

38:28.264 --> 38:31.183
Are we just pawns in a chess game?
You think you can play us as you please?

38:31.267 --> 38:33.811
We weren't deliberately trying
to ruin your life.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.273
You got caught in the crosshairs.

38:37.773 --> 38:39.233
I'm sorry for what happened.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.031
Now, see?

38:45.698 --> 38:46.532
I don't believe you.

38:46.615 --> 38:49.410
You're apologizing because I figured out
you played me for a fool, right?

38:49.493 --> 38:52.121
Now you expect me to trust
anything that comes out of your mouth?

38:52.204 --> 38:55.374
Of the two guys I can choose from,
Jeon might be the better bet.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.043
But you're not a criminal.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.919
I wasn't, but you're making me one.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.130
You operate exactly like that gangster.

39:01.213 --> 39:03.341
You exploit others
for your own benefit.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.925
It's one mafia or the other.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.928
And I'd rather work with the one
that'll actually make me money.

39:10.097 --> 39:12.600
You're furious and saying dangerous things
you don't really mean.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.352
No, I actually mean it.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.562
It's your job
to look after the national interests,

39:16.645 --> 39:19.440
and it's mine
to look after my personal interests.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.865
I think the steak tartare must be off.
I don't feel so hot.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.076
Mmm, no. It can't be that.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.559
Hey, buddy. Make sure to eat properly.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.812
Have some fun
while we wait for the delivery, huh?

39:58.396 --> 40:01.148
Sure. I'll have fun at the pastor's house.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.983
Have a good flight and stay in touch, huh?

40:03.067 --> 40:03.943
Yeah.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.233
Welcome!

40:44.316 --> 40:45.860
Welcome!

40:45.943 --> 40:47.570
Our guest has arrived.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.947
Good morning!
How are you, partner?

40:50.030 --> 40:53.242
Hey, how come you're dressed
for a pool party again?

40:53.325 --> 40:55.494
Don't we have work to do?

40:55.578 --> 40:58.456
It's typical of ex-cons
to focus on their next paycheck.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.791
Your head gets filled
with dancing dollar signs.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.378
Relax. Take a look around.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.590
Then join us.
The Jacuzzi's waiting for you.

41:07.673 --> 41:09.175
Show him a good time.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.969
Ah, that's okay.
I'm good, I'm good.

41:12.052 --> 41:15.222
I'm, uh, sort of a loner.
I'd rather go to my room for now.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.350
-No offense.
-Let's go.

42:40.349 --> 42:43.394
You came here to be saved, yet you ran.

42:44.186 --> 42:45.729
You turned your back on us!

42:48.983 --> 42:52.736
Lord, we pray for your guidance.
Please forgive our sister's sin.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.030
Please forgive our sister, Lord.

42:55.114 --> 42:58.742
Help us, Lord,
to save her from her vanity and greed.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.786
Please save our sister, Lord.

43:00.869 --> 43:04.081
We gave in to temptation.
We repent for our sins.

43:04.164 --> 43:05.749
Please grant us your embrace, Lord.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.918
Please grant us your embrace, Lord.

43:08.002 --> 43:11.088
Lord, protect us from evil!

43:11.171 --> 43:14.592
We repent for our arrogance!
We repent for our pride! We repent, Lord!

43:15.593 --> 43:16.677
Amen.

43:17.261 --> 43:18.262
Amen.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.431
Amen.

43:22.141 --> 43:22.975
Amen.

43:23.726 --> 43:24.560
Amen.

43:33.986 --> 43:34.862
CHEN ZHEN

43:34.945 --> 43:36.614
Oh!

43:36.697 --> 43:38.115
DECLINING CALL

43:40.159 --> 43:43.954
INPUT MESSAGE

43:44.038 --> 43:46.749
CHEN ZHEN

43:56.925 --> 43:59.470
Hey, Ingu. What's going on?
How's the food treating you?

43:59.553 --> 44:00.971
<i> Fine. No one's around.</i>

44:01.055 --> 44:03.641
I found a deserted area on the grounds.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.559
They haven't bugged the bushes.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.479
I've been waiting
for you to check back in.

44:09.855 --> 44:12.066
First, there's some personal things
to clear up.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.652
I want to reiterate my sincere apology

44:14.735 --> 44:17.696
for the trouble our NIS operations
caused you and your family.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.823
Hey, the government does what it wants.
Let's move on.

44:19.907 --> 44:23.285
Forget the government.
This is personal, not professional.

44:23.952 --> 44:26.914
We know the repercussions of our actions
have made things difficult for you,

44:26.997 --> 44:30.167
so I've asked the department to consider
additional compensation for your troubles.

44:31.043 --> 44:33.045
Thank you.
I wasn't expecting to hear that.

44:33.128 --> 44:36.715
I appreciate you considered the impact
this has on regular people.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.134
I accept your apology
even though I'm stuck in a crazy house.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.220
Anything new to report from there?

44:41.804 --> 44:44.515
Only threats form Chen Zhen.
He says we need to meet.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.684
<i>How do I deal with this asshole?</i>

44:46.767 --> 44:48.310
CHEN ZHEN CONTINUES TO THREATEN

44:48.894 --> 44:51.313
You can't put him off too much longer.
Don't go there alone.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.898
Call us, and we'll get you protection.

44:53.899 --> 44:56.610
Also, about Jeon's believers…

44:57.444 --> 44:59.113
Yes? What'd you find out?

44:59.196 --> 45:02.241
I followed some of them
when I heard a commotion outside.

45:02.324 --> 45:06.161
It was some kind of punishment for a woman
they berated and beat with a stick.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.747
Then everybody had to drink
this blue stuff laced with cocaine,

45:08.831 --> 45:09.957
which would be weird anyway,

45:10.040 --> 45:12.710
but all the kids
in the congregation drank it too.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.796
The kids drank it?

45:23.303 --> 45:25.806
SURINAME AIR FORCE BASE

45:35.190 --> 45:36.358
Ah shit.

45:47.453 --> 45:51.123
<i>CO 245, Paradise Bird,</i>
<i>requesting permission to land.</i>

45:53.250 --> 45:54.543
Paradise Bird.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.044
Request granted.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.504
Proceed to R1 runway.

46:13.061 --> 46:14.438
Manna from heaven…

46:14.521 --> 46:16.106
Gives life to the world.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.067
Welcome, my dear friend!

46:22.696 --> 46:23.697
Everything is good, pal.

46:24.573 --> 46:26.158
Why come yourself?

46:26.241 --> 46:27.618
Ah, it's not my decision.

46:27.701 --> 46:29.953
The boss… He sent me.

46:30.537 --> 46:33.332
Because I suddenly asked
for such a large amount?

46:33.415 --> 46:35.125
And more than half on credit.

46:35.918 --> 46:39.296
I'm your guarantor,
so I'm responsible for this deal.

46:40.839 --> 46:42.090
Don't worry.

46:42.174 --> 46:45.219
I will get this done in a month,
like I promised.

46:47.721 --> 46:48.597
David.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.725
Here.

46:51.809 --> 46:56.021
Your little boy likes
Manchester United's Ji-sung Park, right?

46:56.814 --> 46:58.482
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

46:58.565 --> 47:01.860
We got an autograph from him in London.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.487
Give it to your son.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.491
My son will be happy to get this.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.618
Thank you,

47:09.701 --> 47:12.496
always for your precious gift.

47:12.579 --> 47:15.415
You are welcome,
thanks to you.

47:18.293 --> 47:19.628
The merch is ready.

47:38.564 --> 47:40.858
One hundred percent.

47:40.941 --> 47:45.737
Colombian cocaine really is
the real deal.

47:45.821 --> 47:48.073
It's filled with the Holy Spirit.

48:05.090 --> 48:08.010
<i> Ingu, how's it going?</i>
<i>Did you eat anything good today?</i>

48:08.093 --> 48:10.178
I have a few minutes
before I have to meet Chen Zhen.

48:10.262 --> 48:11.513
I'm at his casino.

48:13.891 --> 48:17.060
All right. But I asked you not
to go anywhere without letting us know.

48:18.770 --> 48:19.897
Uh, but since you're there,

48:19.980 --> 48:21.648
<i>what're you planning</i>
<i>to do at this meeting?</i>

48:21.732 --> 48:25.152
I don't plan to do anything
besides listen and tell him what I think.

48:25.861 --> 48:28.447
I don't like talking to this guy,
but I didn't think I had a choice.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.198
<i>Anyway, it's a public place.</i>

48:30.282 --> 48:32.659
<i>I don't think they'll try</i>
<i>to do anything to me here, right?</i>

48:36.330 --> 48:37.372
Is that you?

48:38.040 --> 48:39.708
It sounds like you're in trouble.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.418
What's going on?

48:43.128 --> 48:45.088
-Piece of shit!
-Fuck!

48:45.172 --> 48:47.174
-Kick him!
-Fuck!

48:47.257 --> 48:48.634
Hit him more!

48:50.719 --> 48:51.803
Fucker!

48:53.263 --> 48:54.598
Fucking bastard!

49:06.568 --> 49:07.402
Goddamn it!

49:28.799 --> 49:30.133
I warned you.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.887
I have the exclusive rights
to sell cocaine to Korea.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.765
But you got in bed with the pastor.

49:37.349 --> 49:40.143
Do Koreans always bite
the hand that feeds you?

49:40.227 --> 49:41.853
What are you talking about?

49:44.064 --> 49:46.233
You think I like doing business
with the pastor?

49:47.275 --> 49:50.529
I told you, I want to kill the bastard.

49:50.612 --> 49:52.406
Cut the crap, Kang.

49:53.865 --> 49:56.535
Just take responsibility for your choice.

49:58.912 --> 50:00.622
Chen Zhen, you idiot!

50:00.706 --> 50:03.667
If you kill me,
the pastor loses big money!

50:03.750 --> 50:04.668
Then he'll kill you.

50:04.751 --> 50:07.295
Hey! Hey, hey, this is my zoo.

50:07.379 --> 50:12.342
Do you know how many people have gone
into the stomachs of those alligators?

50:22.894 --> 50:25.188
The pastor will think you ran away.

50:26.606 --> 50:27.816
Don't you worry.

50:30.152 --> 50:33.030
Attack him first.
Surprise him on his turf.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.114
Then I can help you.

50:36.908 --> 50:38.368
How can you help me?

50:38.952 --> 50:40.912
I'll tell you when to time your attack.

50:45.333 --> 50:47.794
Boss.
Let's just cut and feed him.

50:50.422 --> 50:51.757
Listen to me.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.550
I kill the pastor.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.802
Then you clean out his crew.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.848
When that's done,
we sell his coke to Korea together.

51:00.390 --> 51:01.266
Okay?

51:10.108 --> 51:11.860
The pastor has to die

51:12.569 --> 51:14.905
before shipping the coke to Korea.

51:14.988 --> 51:16.364
Otherwise,

51:17.324 --> 51:19.326
you will die instead.

51:21.953 --> 51:23.497
Okay. I got it.

51:54.486 --> 51:55.987
INCOMING CALL
KANG THE PROFESSIONAL

51:58.573 --> 51:59.908
<i>Hey, it's Ingu.</i>

51:59.991 --> 52:01.535
Thanks for calling, Ingu. You all right?

52:01.618 --> 52:03.161
Still alive.

52:03.245 --> 52:06.081
That bastard Chen's crew
just dropped me in the street.

52:06.164 --> 52:07.749
They almost fed me to the alligators.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.001
I knew this would happen.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.546
I told you not to go anywhere
without calling first.

52:12.629 --> 52:13.839
Hey, you knew where I was.

52:13.922 --> 52:15.549
Don't your agents know
where the casino is?

52:15.632 --> 52:17.717
Or is it that my ass is expandable? Huh?

52:17.801 --> 52:18.760
Do you have agents here?

52:18.844 --> 52:20.428
It's complicated.

52:20.512 --> 52:23.807
Chinatown is another world,
and outsiders are spotted a mile away.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.851
You should've mentioned that before.

52:25.934 --> 52:28.061
I can only be in trouble
outside Chinatown?

52:29.271 --> 52:30.856
I should've been more clear.

52:30.939 --> 52:32.774
<i>We'll tighten our safety protocols.</i>

52:50.041 --> 52:51.626
How did you know I was here?

52:51.710 --> 52:54.087
We thought something might be wrong
when we couldn't find you.

52:54.171 --> 52:56.131
Pastor Jeon told us
to ask around the neighborhood.

52:57.424 --> 52:59.509
Do you have a problem
with Chen Zhen's people?

53:01.386 --> 53:02.220
Not now.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.806
I went to play baccarat
to try to make some money, but I lost.

53:04.890 --> 53:06.433
So I borrowed on credit.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.518
And the next thing I know,
they're pounding my face.

53:09.352 --> 53:10.604
Let that be a lesson.

53:11.104 --> 53:13.773
We can't protect you when you leave
the house without permission.

53:14.482 --> 53:16.276
The boss wants to talk to you.

53:16.818 --> 53:17.736
Let's go.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.832
Track his phone from now on.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.423
-Here.
-What is this?

53:41.259 --> 53:44.095
Are we in a gangster movie or what?
A fucking hood?

54:24.386 --> 54:25.262
Ooh!

54:30.558 --> 54:32.978
It looks like Preacher
had a little fun with you.

54:33.061 --> 54:34.312
What a joker.

54:34.396 --> 54:35.230
Oh!

54:38.024 --> 54:39.734
I know that wasn't his doing.

54:39.818 --> 54:41.611
It was bad luck at the tables.

54:43.405 --> 54:44.489
Is that what I think it is?

54:44.572 --> 54:46.032
Fresh off the airplane.

54:46.116 --> 54:49.160
Which explains
why we were so eager to find you.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.161
Game on.

54:50.870 --> 54:53.123
All of that is ours? That's two tons?

54:53.206 --> 54:55.500
Correct. First-class cocaine

54:55.583 --> 54:57.669
for Asian souls looking
for a first-class high.

55:00.463 --> 55:01.548
Holy shit.

55:05.385 --> 55:08.972
I never thought I would say this about
a bunch of powder, but it's beautiful.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.308
Because it's pure.

55:12.183 --> 55:15.312
There are 80 packages.
Twenty-five kilos each.

55:16.521 --> 55:18.189
This all looks fine to me.

55:18.773 --> 55:21.234
Give me a second
to send a picture to Sangman.

55:22.777 --> 55:24.154
Wow.

55:24.779 --> 55:26.156
Good shot.

55:26.239 --> 55:27.365
TWO TONS CONFIRMED

55:31.411 --> 55:34.164
Okay. We got the pastor on the hook.

55:34.247 --> 55:35.915
We need to wire the money to his account,

55:35.999 --> 55:38.460
then contact the ABIN
so we can coordinate the next steps.

55:50.930 --> 55:53.975
They already wired the money.
Eight million dollars.

55:58.563 --> 56:01.816
I love a guy who moves that fast.

56:03.902 --> 56:05.945
As for our route
towards the Brazilian border,

56:06.029 --> 56:09.282
I want you to stick to this area
near the Sipaliwini River.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.452
Use the terrain to our advantage.

56:12.535 --> 56:13.536
Yes, sir.

56:14.245 --> 56:17.874
Control the territory,
so we control the hand-off situation.

56:22.629 --> 56:24.339
They mapped out
a route to the border.

56:24.422 --> 56:26.132
They want us to move in two days.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.592
They asked me to check in with you

56:27.675 --> 56:30.136
and make sure you can meet us
in the morning day after tomorrow.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.430
Jeon says he'll relay
the exact exchange location

56:32.514 --> 56:33.890
when we're close to delivering.

56:33.973 --> 56:36.393
It's all good
as long as you head towards Brazil.

56:36.893 --> 56:39.687
Keep in touch and follow my instructions,
and you'll be fine.

56:39.771 --> 56:42.440
I know how it works now, Sangman.
It's all good.

56:43.608 --> 56:46.403
<i> Is there anything else?</i>
<i>Anything I should be aware of?</i>

56:46.486 --> 56:49.114
Uh, not concerning the delivery.

56:50.448 --> 56:54.577
But I have to say being away from home
for so long is taking its toll.

56:55.161 --> 56:57.664
When I was little, my father enlisted.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.875
He went to fight in Vietnam.
I realize that must've scarred him.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.585
It scars all of us.

57:06.339 --> 57:07.590
I understand the mixed emotions.

57:07.674 --> 57:10.218
I've been far from home
for years serving my country.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.264
If our Brazil operation is successful,
the DEA will be all over this thing.

57:14.347 --> 57:16.141
Then you can go back home soon.

57:16.224 --> 57:17.308
Right.

57:18.059 --> 57:19.227
There's one more thing.

57:20.478 --> 57:23.398
You said you'd be able
to get us some bonus compensation?

57:23.481 --> 57:25.775
Uh, yeah, I got 20 million more for you.

57:25.859 --> 57:27.777
<i>Twenty million? That's great.</i>

57:27.861 --> 57:29.362
Listen. Can you do me a favor?

57:29.446 --> 57:31.948
Send all of that to Eungsoo's family.

57:32.031 --> 57:33.366
Preferably today.

57:34.492 --> 57:36.870
Today it would have been his birthday.

57:37.912 --> 57:41.207
Oh, I see.
I'll ask them to do it right away.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.919
<i>Be careful out there, Ingu.</i>
<i>I'll see you in two days.</i>

57:45.003 --> 57:47.505
Yeah. You be careful
heading to the border.

57:57.390 --> 57:58.850
Eungsoo.

58:17.327 --> 58:18.536
Brother Kang.

58:20.497 --> 58:22.916
I'm sure you've never done
anything like this.

58:22.999 --> 58:25.168
Nervous? It's a big deal.

58:26.085 --> 58:27.253
Pfft.

58:27.337 --> 58:29.756
I'm just excited.
I like the smell of money.

58:32.675 --> 58:35.094
An autographed ball
celebrating Park's 100th win.

58:35.178 --> 58:37.222
Ever since I owned it,
it's been a talisman of sorts.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.265
-I want you to have it.
-Wow!

58:39.349 --> 58:42.018
Park's career 100th? You didn't have to.

58:42.101 --> 58:44.521
It's to help me feel less guilty
for not going with you.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.397
Worship service has priority.

58:46.898 --> 58:49.734
I just want protection for my new partner.

58:50.485 --> 58:51.319
I can feel it.

59:04.415 --> 59:06.834
SURINAME-BRAZIL BORDER

59:22.934 --> 59:24.894
Five minutes to destination.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.982
Security team,
get ready in your designated area.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.251
DAVID PARK

59:48.876 --> 59:49.711
Done.

59:53.214 --> 59:55.592
We have the coordinates from Jeon
for the meeting point.

59:55.675 --> 59:56.884
We are ten minutes out.

59:56.968 --> 59:59.345
Let me remind you,
our guys are running the show out there.

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:03.349
<i>As for the Venezuelan team,</i>
<i>when the Brazilian border patrol shows up</i>

1:00:03.433 --> 1:00:05.268
<i>and tries to confiscate the cocaine,</i>

1:00:05.351 --> 1:00:07.937
<i>all we need to do</i>
<i>is act surprised and keep cool.</i>

1:00:08.438 --> 1:00:10.940
<i>The guns we provided</i>
<i>are meant for show, not shooting.</i>

1:00:11.024 --> 1:00:13.776
We don't want there to be bloodshed.
We want everyone in one piece.

1:00:13.860 --> 1:00:16.195
We seize the drugs and money
without firing any bullets.

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:18.031
No one dies on this mission.

1:00:19.365 --> 1:00:21.618
No other details of the assignment
will be made available.

1:00:21.701 --> 1:00:25.121
It's a need-to-know opp.
We expect full cooperation. Over.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:28.124
Roger that. We have what we need. Over.

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:33.296
This is NIS.

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:36.716
I'm sending the rendezvous location
for Brazil border patrol.

1:01:34.273 --> 1:01:36.025
Ingu! Tell me you're not hungry.

1:01:36.109 --> 1:01:37.193
Ha!

1:01:37.276 --> 1:01:39.779
Actually, there was no way to stop
and get food along the way.

1:01:39.862 --> 1:01:42.949
However, I've got something that no food
in the world can beat. Lunch can wait.

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:43.991
Mmm. That's okay.

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:48.162
So, David. Why don't we get down to it
so you can get back home?

1:01:48.246 --> 1:01:49.330
Great.

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:52.542
First, though, show me the money.

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:53.751
That's how we do it.

1:01:58.548 --> 1:02:02.051
Straightforward. Gotta respect that.
Ha. Over here.

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:25.825
Freeze!

1:02:29.203 --> 1:02:31.914
Stop! Stop! Don't move!

1:02:37.837 --> 1:02:39.881
We are Brazil border guards.

1:02:40.381 --> 1:02:41.382
Nobody moves.
