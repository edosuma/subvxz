WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.308
We need to get the engines
back up to near light speed
or we won'’t reach Prox B.

00:04.308 --> 00:07.181
Plus, there'’s a murderer
onboard, and we still have
no idea what hit us.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.879
Do you even know who she is?
She didn'’t train
with the rest of us.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.272
So happy to meet you, gentlemen.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.752
Susan, do you know
anything about this?

00:13.752 --> 00:18.322
All I know is she was
assigned here last-minute
by someone high up.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.020
What are you doing here?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.717
I was just checking
the entrance logs

00:21.717 --> 00:24.285
to see who came in here last,
but they'’ve been wiped.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.808
I wonder who
could'’ve done that.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.549
Eva Markovic, Lieutenant Lane,

00:27.549 --> 00:30.291
Lieutenant Brice, and me.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.858
I want you to only think
of the good times with Harris.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.773
Think you can do that?

00:34.773 --> 00:36.688
I'’m officially naming you
head of shipwide mental health.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.257
You don'’t think
this is the murder weapon.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.743
There'’s some kind of crystal
thing wedged in there.

00:47.743 --> 00:51.138
They look like diamonds.
Lane, the glove'’s
fingers are nearly off!

00:51.138 --> 00:54.010
When you said you'’d shut down
the coolant system,

00:54.010 --> 00:56.404
did you mean
the engine coolant system?

00:56.404 --> 00:59.233
I bought us one, maybe
two days of drinking water.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.886
So you chose more days of life.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.766
- <i></i>
- <i>Attention all hands.</i>

01:10.766 --> 01:13.812
<i>This is Lieutenant Garnet.</i>

01:13.812 --> 01:15.814
<i>As you may be aware,
for the last hour,</i>

01:15.814 --> 01:17.642
<i>our engines
have been offline.</i>

01:17.642 --> 01:20.384
Due to...

01:20.384 --> 01:23.039
technical difficulties
in reclamation,

01:23.039 --> 01:27.478
<i>we'’ve lost a large percentage
of our water supply.</i>

01:27.478 --> 01:29.219
To that end, we'’ve shut
down our engines

01:29.219 --> 01:32.048
and redirected
its coolant water
to life support.

01:32.048 --> 01:35.138
I won'’t lie to you,
we'’re in a tight spot.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.488
<i>We have only four days
of water left.</i>

01:37.488 --> 01:39.142
<i>In an effort
to stretch supplies,</i>

01:39.142 --> 01:40.665
<i>effective immediately,</i>

01:40.665 --> 01:42.363
<i>we'’re cutting water rations
in half.</i>

01:49.239 --> 01:51.198
I hate to ask you
to make yet another sacrifice,

01:51.198 --> 01:54.462
but we have no other choice.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.942
I will keep you updated
of all further developments.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.168
I have no doubt in
the ingenuity and resilience

02:05.168 --> 02:08.998
of this amazing crew
to see us through the current
crisis. Garnet out.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.261
Bad move.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.610
You think people
were rioting and going
crazy before.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.743
You just triggered a tsunami.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.398
- We should'’ve kept
that to ourselves.
- Everybody has a right to know.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.964
I'’m pretty sure that's not how
the chain of command works.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.184
We'’re a colony ship,
not military.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.056
We became a military vessel
when we came out of cryo early,

02:24.056 --> 02:26.581
lost half of our crew,
and were forced to make
the hard decisions

02:26.581 --> 02:28.148
most of these people
aren'’t trained for.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.758
You can'’t treat
scientists and technicians

02:29.758 --> 02:31.020
like they'’re soldiers.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.935
We'’re in a war
for survival.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.502
Everyone onboard
has been drafted.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.112
So, if I'’m Chief
of Life Support,

02:36.112 --> 02:37.461
that makes me
an officer, right?

02:37.461 --> 02:40.247
Our job is to protect
everyone on this crew,

02:40.247 --> 02:42.118
both physically
and psychologically.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.381
We can'’t just make announcements
that are gonna panic everyone.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.035
I have faith
in people'’s resolve.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.124
That faith is gonna bite us
in the ass if you don'’t--

02:48.124 --> 02:52.259
So the plan is for
you two just to argue
until we die of thirst?

02:56.350 --> 02:58.830
Fine, where are we
with the engines?

02:58.830 --> 03:00.571
The NEPS cannot run
without water as coolant.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.530
The Nuclear Electric
Propulsion system'’s

03:02.530 --> 03:04.140
a genius design
by William Trust.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.011
He just never accounted for,
you know, any of this.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.926
Can we deploy
the solar sails?

03:07.926 --> 03:10.886
Wouldn'’t work.
We need to be closer to a star.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.279
So we divert power
back to the NEPS.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.237
- No.
- No?

03:14.237 --> 03:16.457
I'’m pretty sure
you meant, "Let'’s talk
through our options."

03:16.457 --> 03:18.633
- It'’s a waste of resources.
- We need to go
search for water.

03:18.633 --> 03:22.114
Where? Brice, were you able
to find any planetary systems

03:22.114 --> 03:23.855
our hobbled engines
could get us to in time?

03:23.855 --> 03:25.292
Not charting any, no.

03:25.292 --> 03:28.033
Mm.

03:28.033 --> 03:31.428
- Oh, shit.
- What?

03:31.428 --> 03:34.170
Do you remember
30 seconds ago when water
was our biggest problem?

03:34.170 --> 03:36.825
- What now?
- The long-range sensors
just alerted.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.827
Our drift has taken us
right into a collision course

03:38.827 --> 03:41.133
- with an asteroid.
- Get those engines going now.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.483
That'’s what
I'’ve been saying.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.615
Start-up takes 12 hours.
10 if I cut corners.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.008
I need to refill
the chambers--

03:46.008 --> 03:48.445
Look, you'’re wasting time explaining.

03:48.445 --> 03:49.620
We'’re gonna need
those engines fast.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.579
How fast?

03:51.579 --> 03:53.407
Impact'’s in six hours.

03:59.369 --> 04:02.416
Great. We just went from having
four days to live...

04:02.416 --> 04:03.765
to six hours.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.497
Shit.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.804
I'’ve run it half a dozen times,
and at its current speed,

04:42.804 --> 04:45.110
the impact will be like
hurling a boulder at an ant.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.376
Got a minute,
Lieutenant Lane?

04:49.376 --> 04:50.986
We still haven'’t
finished our conversation.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.596
Seriously?

04:52.596 --> 04:54.381
The murder investigation.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.905
Yeah, look,
don'’t touch me.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.255
How did you know
the murder weapon was found
in the water system?

04:59.255 --> 05:01.562
Everybody knows.
Plant boy can'’t keep
his mouth shut.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.781
And where were you
at 1600 shift time
the day of the murder?

05:03.781 --> 05:06.697
Really, you'’re doing this now?
We'’re in crisis mode.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.090
We'’re limping through
space on a broken ship.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.221
We'’ll always be
in crisis mode.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.658
The fact is,
there'’s been a murder.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.617
That asteroid is about
to murder everyone,

05:13.617 --> 05:16.228
so help or get out.

05:16.228 --> 05:19.101
Felix, Lane is right.
This is all hands on deck.

05:19.101 --> 05:22.626
I know you
want to do something,
but this isn'’t it.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.069
- What was that?
- What?

05:31.069 --> 05:34.246
I don'’t need you
to fight my battles.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.327
Oh, my God.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.765
Oh.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.816
Nathan, add extra
surge protection.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.646
Novak, check
the radiation seals.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.996
How can I help?
Anything you need.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.607
I know the NEPS
aren'’t my specialty,
but I'’m a quick study.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.001
If it helps, I found a way
to get two extra gallons
of water from life support.

06:33.001 --> 06:36.396
I know it'’s not much,
you could pump it into the--

06:36.396 --> 06:38.702
Alicia, I appreciate
that you want to help,

06:38.702 --> 06:40.965
but unless you know
how to jumpstart the NEPS,

06:40.965 --> 06:44.882
I need you
to get out of the way.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.406
- The insulation is in.
- Seals are solid.

06:48.930 --> 06:53.195
There'’s one thing
you can do. Pray.

06:55.153 --> 06:58.113
Um, I haven'’t really
sorted out my feelings
on spirituality.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.854
I know that science
doesn'’t preclude
the existence of God,

06:59.854 --> 07:01.464
and the idea itself
can be emotionally comforting.

07:01.464 --> 07:05.381
But at the same time,
there is little evidence
to, um...

07:15.173 --> 07:18.394
They stole all my stimulants,
painkillers, and dissociatives.

07:18.394 --> 07:21.310
Someone probably
wants to numb themselves
to their impending death.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.182
They'’re gonna do more than that.
Those meds are strong.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.576
If whoever stole them
takes too much,

07:26.576 --> 07:29.579
they'’ll O.D.
and die long before
anything else kills them.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
The jumpstart didn'’t work.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.846
What'’s our next move
to get the NEPS up?

07:35.846 --> 07:38.936
There isn'’t one.
We'’re putting out fires
down here, literally!

07:38.936 --> 07:42.549
How bad? It'’s another problem
that'’s about to kill us?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.551
No, I'’ll have it
under control before we die.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.557
The engines were
our best shot of getting
clear of the asteroid.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.428
- Our only shot.
- Come on, guys, think.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.996
Neither of you have
another idea? Anything?

07:54.996 --> 07:56.867
Well, you wanted
to be in charge.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.793
James? James.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.448
- Lieutenant Brice.
- Oh, hey, doc.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.320
Listen, I'’m just
on my way to a briefing.
So unless this is urgent--

08:15.320 --> 08:16.583
Yeah, I pinged you
three times.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.236
Yeah, no, no, no.
I saw, I saw.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.456
But the hand'’s doing fine.
You know, it stings a bit.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.763
But from what I hear,
we'’re a little short on
painkillers anyway, so--

08:22.763 --> 08:24.286
We are, but that'’s
not what this--

08:24.286 --> 08:26.027
Honestly,
don'’t worry about me.
I can handle it.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.159
Yeah, I need
to see you in med bay.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.161
I just told you
I can handle the pain.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.424
This isn'’t about your injury.
I need to run a physical on you.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.818
Why?

08:34.818 --> 08:37.473
Your medical file
got corrupted somehow.

08:37.473 --> 08:40.911
I'’d like to give you
an exam and make sure
your chart is up to date.

08:44.306 --> 08:47.091
Come on, doc.
Look at me. I'’m fit as an ox.

08:47.091 --> 08:51.618
I need specific numbers,
lipid panels, pulse ox,
stuff like that.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.489
So I still need
to take measurements,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.491
draw some blood,
fill out your chart.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.885
Why don'’t
we just do it right now?

08:57.885 --> 09:01.410
I'’m not sure if you've heard,
but we might all be dying
in the next couple of hours.

09:01.410 --> 09:05.283
Right. Then if we live,

09:05.283 --> 09:08.635
I need you to report
to med bay first thing.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.115
One crisis at a time,
hey, doc?

09:20.298 --> 09:21.909
Hey.
Looking all over for you.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.693
I was kinda wondering
if you have

09:23.693 --> 09:27.349
the inside scoop
from the bridge?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.699
Lower decks are convinced
that we'’re gonna die.

09:32.572 --> 09:37.054
That'’s the asteroid,
and, yeah, it'’s gonna kill us.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.975
Hey, look, I know
I don'’t know you that well,

09:44.975 --> 09:48.283
but it doesn'’t seem like you
to be so-- so defeated.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.811
After everything
we'’ve been through,

09:54.811 --> 09:57.509
the thing that'’s going
to end us is a giant rock

09:57.509 --> 09:59.424
randomly hurtling
through space.

09:59.424 --> 10:02.602
Now I'’ll never see Prox B.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.343
I'’ll never have kids.
Never fall in love.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.781
Not that I might even
want to have kids on
a strange planet anyway.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.697
- Not that anyone would ever
fall in love with me--
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.742
What? Hi.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.136
For what it'’s worth,
if we'’d have lived,

10:15.136 --> 10:17.355
I could have seen myself
falling in love with you.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.793
- You'’re making fun of me.
- No, wait. Are you kidding?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.664
- You'’re amazing.
- Please don'’t.

10:21.664 --> 10:26.321
No, no, I'’m serious.
You'’re so cool and so smart.

10:26.321 --> 10:30.412
I mean, you saved our lives.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.763
When we were running
out of oxygen, you went
from waste management

10:33.763 --> 10:36.592
to Chief of Life Support
in less than a day.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.855
You'’re the genius girl
who sees a problem
and solves it,

10:38.855 --> 10:41.989
so what I don'’t understand
is why are you giving up now?

10:41.989 --> 10:44.905
Why aren'’t you solving
this problem, too?

10:44.905 --> 10:48.038
I really don'’t know.

10:48.038 --> 10:51.694
Maybe it'’s an unsolvable
problem, but...

10:51.694 --> 10:54.218
I should still try to solve it.

11:01.138 --> 11:04.402
- Okay, how can I help?
- What do you know
about astrophysics?

11:04.402 --> 11:05.447
Absolutely nothing.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.715
Uh, you wanted to see me,
Lieutenant Garnet?

11:12.715 --> 11:14.891
Yeah, join us.
We could use all the help
we can get right now.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.414
Sure.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.720
My-- my pleasure.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.420
Everything in space
is in motion,

11:22.420 --> 11:25.293
so even with the engines dead,
we'’re still drifting.

11:25.293 --> 11:28.688
Wow, what are the odds
that our drift would put us
in the course of an asteroid?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.211
Well, it'’s better than
you'’d think, actually.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.300
It'’s 1 in 700,326.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.785
It came up on the computer.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.830
Calculations
have the point of impact
as our foresection.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.528
Poetic justice.
If we don'’t figure this out,

11:43.528 --> 11:45.705
bridge crew is first to die.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.837
A whole tenth of a second
before the rest of the ship.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.187
If I could'’ve
just gotten the NEPS up

11:50.187 --> 11:51.623
for a few seconds,
one second--

11:51.623 --> 11:53.408
What do you mean?

11:53.408 --> 11:54.452
All we needed
was one moment of thrust

11:54.452 --> 11:55.932
to change our drift path

11:55.932 --> 11:57.455
and move us out
of the asteroid'’s way.

11:57.455 --> 12:01.242
Too bad we can'’t
get out and push.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.593
What did you just say?

12:04.593 --> 12:07.509
Get out and-- you know,
like a car?

12:07.509 --> 12:09.772
It was a stupid joke. Sorry.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.905
Brice, you think
you can do it?

12:11.905 --> 12:14.951
Come on, I'’d be insulted
if you asked anyone else.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.040
- Eva?
- No problem.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.477
I'’ll run the numbers for
the best point of contact.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.044
- Objections?
- Only that I wish

12:21.044 --> 12:23.525
we'’d have thought
of this two hours ago.

12:23.525 --> 12:27.224
- Then let'’s do it.
- I feel like the conversation
went left and I went right.

12:27.224 --> 12:30.271
You'’re a genius, Angus.

12:30.271 --> 12:34.057
Thank you. What did I say?

12:34.057 --> 12:36.625
Seriously,
I don'’t know what I said.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.487
I'’ve wanted to take
this baby out since Earth.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.837
Wish the circumstances
were a bit better, but...

13:17.274 --> 13:19.233
Oh!

13:19.233 --> 13:20.843
Lieutenant Brice
is gonna use the shuttle

13:20.843 --> 13:23.715
to literally get out and push us
onto a different course.

13:23.715 --> 13:27.763
- I am a genius.
- You need a copilot?

13:27.763 --> 13:31.071
Oh, come on.
It'’s a milk run.

13:31.071 --> 13:34.117
Right, let'’s get
this thing done.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.903
Firing up the pre-burn now.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.732
<i>What did you do?</i>

13:40.732 --> 13:41.603
Tried to start the preburn.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.434
What the hell?

13:46.434 --> 13:48.610
The console says
I'’m missing parts?

13:51.874 --> 13:57.532
- Oh, no.
- Okay, what did you do?

13:57.532 --> 14:00.187
Oh, well,
there was so much happening

14:00.187 --> 14:02.058
and I didn'’t think
we'’d need to use the shuttle
for a long time,

14:02.058 --> 14:05.714
and, oh, it was
just one little hose.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.978
- You stole a hose?
- A fuel hose, for irrigation.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.850
And you didn'’t think
to tell any of us until now?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.112
You guys, it'’s also saying
that we'’re missing a--

14:12.112 --> 14:14.897
- Power coupler.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

14:14.897 --> 14:17.204
Stein salvaged one
for the NEPS.

14:17.204 --> 14:20.729
He told me
I didn'’t want to know
where he found it.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.035
Look, these parts aren'’t
plug-and-play.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.471
It'’s gonna take a while
to calibrate.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.604
- Can you do it in time?
- I honestly don'’t know.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.519
Draft whoever
you need to help.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.173
Have some of the techs
grab the parts and help Brice,

14:30.173 --> 14:33.829
then get back here ASAP.
You, too, Angus.

14:36.179 --> 14:39.139
- What are we going to do here?
- Figure out plan C.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.407
A burst of thrust here

14:46.407 --> 14:48.235
would get us out
of the asteroid'’s path.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.193
It'’s a simple maneuver.
Brice can do it.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.021
If he can fix
the shuttle in time.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.371
Until then, we have to come up
with an alternative plan.

14:54.371 --> 14:57.635
That'’s the men's showers
on the other side
of the hull, right?

14:57.635 --> 14:59.986
- Yeah.
- What if we sealed off the room

14:59.986 --> 15:01.988
and blew a hole
in the outer hull?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
The escaping air pressure
could give us thrust.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.426
Or it could break us in half.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.731
The detonation could
destroy hull integrity.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.690
You asked for
alternative plans.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.648
We don'’t even carry explosives.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.869
Actually, between human waste
and human remains,

15:13.869 --> 15:17.220
I'’ve collected
a lot of fertilizer.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.701
Fertilizer can be turned
into an explosive.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.663
It could work.
Over-pressurize the room,
keep the detonation small.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.884
And the expulsion
of pressurized oxygen would
give us a moment of thrust.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.930
It'’s dangerous, but we don't
have a lot of choices.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.670
You'’re right.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.021
We'’re out of time
and options.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.283
Let'’s blow another hole
in our ship.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.378
Which one do you need?

15:46.641 --> 15:48.599
What did you do?

15:48.599 --> 15:49.949
Bring every hose
in the bioshelter?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.082
- Yeah.
- All right.

15:53.082 --> 15:57.869
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Where are you? That'’s it.

16:00.872 --> 16:03.266
All right, you are on.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.054
You little beauty!

16:08.054 --> 16:10.230
All right, power you up.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.106
Oh, for God'’s sake.
All right, you.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.326
You'’re done. Let's go.
Move, move.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.762
Give me that.
Thank you very much.
You'’re on a break.

16:20.762 --> 16:21.632
Thank you. Have a good day.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.555
Do you have any idea
how hard that was to find?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.688
Actually, yeah.
You might have killed us.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.345
Great.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.745
Still no power.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.356
Are you sure
you'’re doing it right?

16:49.356 --> 16:51.097
Are you asking me
if I know how to push a button?

16:51.097 --> 16:53.795
Right, just move.
Move, move, move, move.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.536
I'’ll do it myself.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.973
All right, this is it.
Here we go.

16:57.973 --> 17:02.412
Here we go, right?
Lucky charm. Let'’s go now!

17:04.327 --> 17:07.678
Oh, that is just shite.
That is shite.

17:07.678 --> 17:10.594
I mean, we'’ve fixed
everything twice.
There'’s nothing left to fix.

17:18.689 --> 17:22.911
That has to be it now.
That actually has to be it now.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.826
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.436
You this time. You.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.047
Lucky charm, lucky charm.

17:37.534 --> 17:43.062
We'’re done. We're done!

17:45.760 --> 17:49.764
Oh. Oh, very funny.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.809
Very funny! Well done.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.856
Good joke.
Everybody'’s laughing.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.424
A directed explosion
is tricky.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.079
I need to measure, factor in
blast trajectory, and--

18:08.348 --> 18:12.830
Oh, looks like we just found
Kabir'’s missing drugs.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.573
This ends right the hell now!

18:16.573 --> 18:21.361
Who the hell are you
to give us orders?

18:21.361 --> 18:24.929
Honestly, I'’ve been asking
the same thing for days.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.018
I didn'’t sign up
for any of this,

18:27.018 --> 18:29.238
but you keep
ordering me around.

18:29.238 --> 18:32.633
We'’re not astronauts
or officers or whatever.

18:32.633 --> 18:37.377
- We are just passengers.
- Let me be clear.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.206
You are crew on this ship
until we reach our destination,

18:40.206 --> 18:42.077
and you will do as you'’re told.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.645
Right now, your orders
are to clean up your mess

18:44.645 --> 18:47.256
and get the hell out
of here, double-time.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.867
Every damn one of you,
you'’ve got three seconds

18:49.867 --> 18:53.436
to move your asses
before I send you out
of the goddamn airlock!

18:53.436 --> 18:55.917
Three, two...

19:00.182 --> 19:03.881
- Comments?
- Oh, I approve of everything
that just happened.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.375
- Are you sure about this?
- Of course not.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.073
We'’re about to blow
a hole in our ship
with an IED.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.598
It'’s ready!

19:24.598 --> 19:26.252
- Oh, that reeks.
- Of course it does.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.905
It'’s made of human waste
and remains.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.646
- Well, get it out of here.
- It'’s our bomb.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.996
- Uh, looks a little small.
- It'’s a matter of ratio.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.999
Compost to ammonia gasses
from our fallen comrades and--

19:34.999 --> 19:36.218
Yeah, I don'’t need
to know the science,

19:36.218 --> 19:37.350
I just need to know
if it'’ll go boom.

19:37.350 --> 19:40.309
Oh, it'’ll-- it'll go boom.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.312
I just-- I don'’t know if
it will be too big a boom.

19:43.312 --> 19:47.838
At this point, I don'’t care.
I'’d rather die than
keep smelling this. Here.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.850
- Okay.
- The seal is good.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.378
Okay, I just want to stress

20:05.378 --> 20:06.640
I ran all the measurements
three times,

20:06.640 --> 20:08.468
but I'’ve never
done this before.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.600
Yeah, no one'’s ever
done any of this before,
but you'’re smart.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.516
- It'’ll work.
- You gonna make
an announcement?

20:13.516 --> 20:17.303
It'’s like you said,
better to not
freak everyone out.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.175
- Here.
- It was your idea.
You do it.

20:25.702 --> 20:26.573
You ready?

20:38.324 --> 20:39.586
How much fertilizer
did you use?

20:39.586 --> 20:41.588
Well, in my defense,

20:41.588 --> 20:43.503
the fact that we'’re still
breathing'’s a good sign.

20:43.503 --> 20:44.808
Running a ship-wide
diagnostic.

20:44.808 --> 20:47.333
Hull integrity solid.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.378
But did we move enough?

20:49.378 --> 20:52.381
Because that was our last shot
and the asteroid'’s almost here.

21:11.008 --> 21:15.230
- 586.
- 585.7268.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.624
- I was afraid to round.
- You'’re just saying
numbers out of context.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.800
- Come on--
- We ran the calculations
separately to be sure.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.281
It'’s not exactly
my field of expertise,
but I do love math.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.022
- Just tell us,
are we out of harm'’s way?
- Yes, it worked. Barely.

21:25.022 --> 21:28.025
- The asteroid will miss us
by 586 meters.
- Yes!

21:28.025 --> 21:29.505
- Closer than I'’d like, but--
- It doesn'’t matter.

21:29.505 --> 21:33.640
It was a good idea
well-executed.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.468
Guys! Guys, guys, guys.

21:35.468 --> 21:38.384
Fixed the shuttle,
so I can move the ark now.

21:41.778 --> 21:45.260
What?

21:50.091 --> 21:52.441
I'’m missing something.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.443
We'’re getting more
accurate sensor data

21:54.443 --> 21:57.664
the closer
the asteroid gets, and...

21:57.664 --> 22:00.144
<i>Attention, all hands,
this is Lieutenant Garnet.</i>

22:00.144 --> 22:02.364
We are clear of the asteroid.

22:02.364 --> 22:05.759
<i>I repeat,
we are out of the path
of the asteroid.</i>

22:05.759 --> 22:08.457
Thank God!

22:08.457 --> 22:11.547
Oh, I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry. I just, um--

22:11.547 --> 22:15.029
That-- that'’s okay.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.859
Can I admit something to you?

22:18.859 --> 22:21.383
I was ready
to shit my pants
that whole time,

22:21.383 --> 22:24.517
but, um, focusing
on what you were doing

22:24.517 --> 22:27.084
was probably the only thing
keeping me from passing out.

22:27.084 --> 22:31.262
I'’m glad I could help.
Come on, let'’s go watch it pass.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.889
- Oh, my God.
- What?

22:48.889 --> 22:51.370
- I'’m such an idiot.
- Why?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.719
Look. What do you see?

22:52.719 --> 22:55.112
What, the asteroid?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.766
The asteroid,
which has a tail.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.551
Like a dog has a tail?

22:58.551 --> 23:01.249
Like an expulsion of gas
and dust created by--

23:01.249 --> 23:03.294
Never mind.
I have to go and tell everyone.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.274
You said that we were
gonna be hit by an asteroid.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.623
Yeah, and now we'’re not.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.146
But it'’s not an asteroid.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.714
Yeah, well, asteroid,
giant space rock,

23:31.714 --> 23:33.412
rogue moon,
it'’s not gonna hit us.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.328
It'’s none of those things
because it has a tail.

23:37.328 --> 23:40.767
- Comets have tails.
- Yes.

23:40.767 --> 23:44.945
Uh, okay, so it'’s a comet?
Why does that matter now?

23:44.945 --> 23:46.947
Because comets
are made of ice.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.775
And ice means water.
Don'’t you see?

23:48.775 --> 23:50.951
If we can mine it,
our water problems are solved.

23:50.951 --> 23:54.171
That'’s great.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.217
How the hell
do we mine a moving comet?

24:03.746 --> 24:05.705
We'’ve got the drilling equipment
to get to Prox B.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.794
We just can'’t
get it to the comet,
not with the NEPs down.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.231
Once the comet passes,
the opportunity is gone.

24:10.231 --> 24:14.583
I have an idea.
We have miles of ship-to-ship
refueling hose.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.717
We can use the hose
to tether the ark
to the comet as it passes.

24:17.717 --> 24:21.851
Once connected, we can drill
for all the water we need.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.418
But compared
to the speed of the comet,

24:23.418 --> 24:24.941
it'’s almost like
we'’re standing still.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.203
Couldn'’t tethering
rip us apart?

24:26.203 --> 24:27.553
The hose is high tensile

24:27.553 --> 24:29.555
to account
for ship-to-ship drift.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.122
But you'’re right,
it wasn'’t designed for
this amount of stress.

24:32.122 --> 24:35.256
If we got the ark moving
to match the comet'’s
relative speed...

24:35.256 --> 24:37.040
That would take the strain
off the tether, but...

24:37.040 --> 24:39.086
- No engines.
- Exactly.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.131
So we'’re back to the same
problem we started with.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.003
Not true.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.658
We may not have the NEPS,
but, uh,

24:45.658 --> 24:46.615
we do have an engine.

25:02.152 --> 25:04.807
I was looking over
your shuttle repairs.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.548
Not bad for
a few hours'’ work, eh?

25:06.548 --> 25:08.594
I wouldn'’t know,
you didn'’t file a work log.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.857
Yeah, well, we were on
a bit of a time crunch,

25:10.857 --> 25:13.294
but I promise you
I will fill out all
the relevant paperwork

25:13.294 --> 25:15.252
if we, you know, live.

25:15.252 --> 25:18.429
- Did you recalibrate
the power coupler?
- Yes.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.170
And the fuel hose,
did you use a sealant?

25:20.170 --> 25:22.695
Silicon-based so it
wouldn'’t corrode? Yes.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.175
Novak said you replaced
the engine manifold.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.655
Oh, Eva, so help me,
if you'’re about to ask

25:26.655 --> 25:27.961
if I installed
a new heatsink--

25:27.961 --> 25:30.746
- Well, did you?
- Of course.

25:30.746 --> 25:34.184
Come on, Eva, it'’s fixed.
Do you not trust me?

25:34.184 --> 25:35.795
You'’re a navigator,
not an engineer.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.841
Yeah, but I used
your techs to help me.

25:38.841 --> 25:42.845
Hang on.
Are you a little bit
worried about me?

25:42.845 --> 25:46.632
I'’m worried about all of us.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.677
If this doesn'’t work,
we'’re all dead.

25:48.677 --> 25:52.942
Well, then, you'’d better
let me get out there
and save all our lives.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.522
I'’m surprised
they don'’t need you
on the bridge for this.

26:07.522 --> 26:10.394
Don'’t they need you for,
like, life support things?

26:10.394 --> 26:13.615
Too many cooks in the kitchen,
so I thought I'’d come and watch.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.879
I was hoping
you'’d still be here.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.925
Ah. This is yours.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.368
Hey, Alicia!

26:27.368 --> 26:28.978
Word is we have you to thank
for identifying

26:28.978 --> 26:30.806
the comet as a comet.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.679
I wouldn'’t have seen it
if Baylor hadn'’t encouraged me.

26:33.679 --> 26:38.031
- Oh, then thank you, too.
- No, don'’t thank me.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.120
I'’m pretty sure this
tethering thing will kill us.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.512
Why? The plan'’s genius.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.340
Won'’t attaching to the comet

26:43.340 --> 26:45.908
be like sticking his hand out
to grab a speeding train?

26:45.908 --> 26:47.693
Not at all.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.695
- The asteroid is--
- Oh. Comet.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.349
Yeah, it'’s--
it'’s moving so fast,
and we'’re dead in the water.

26:52.349 --> 26:55.222
Lieutenant Brice
is using the shuttle
like a booster rocket

26:55.222 --> 26:57.311
to accelerate the ark
up to the comet'’s velocity.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.966
Okay, but how can
something so small
get us moving so fast?

26:59.966 --> 27:03.099
We'’re in space.
There'’s no gravity,
no friction or resistance.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.188
Size doesn'’t matter.
Just force.

27:05.188 --> 27:08.583
- Okay, so how much force
can the shuttle generate?
- A lot.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.412
It was designed
to ferry people between
Ark One and Proxima B,

27:11.412 --> 27:15.372
so its engines are
strong enough to break free
of a planet'’s gravity.

27:15.372 --> 27:18.811
Uh, okay, even
if it gets us moving
the same speed

27:18.811 --> 27:21.727
- as the comet, won'’t it--
- When two objects are moving

27:21.727 --> 27:23.293
at the same speed
in the same direction,

27:23.293 --> 27:25.861
it'’s like they're standing still
relative to each other

27:25.861 --> 27:28.385
as far as the laws of physics
are concerned.

27:28.385 --> 27:31.954
To use your example,
it'’ll be like
sticking our hand out

27:31.954 --> 27:33.869
from a second train
going the same speed

27:33.869 --> 27:35.436
and the same direction, relatively.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.222
Okay. Yeah.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.355
Hey, you'’re really good
at explaining this stuff.

27:41.355 --> 27:46.490
What I want to know
is why is Lieutenant Brice
flying the shuttle?

27:46.490 --> 27:49.015
I thought he was a navigator.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.061
- You don'’t know about Brice?
- What about him?

27:52.061 --> 27:56.979
Come on, he'’s like
a legend in the GSA. No?

27:56.979 --> 27:59.765
Okay, he started off
in Cent-Com, right,

27:59.765 --> 28:01.636
when he was a plebe
just like me.

28:01.636 --> 28:06.032
And he became a GSA pilot
faster than anyone ever has.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.251
They say he became
the best in the force
in less than a year,

28:08.251 --> 28:10.079
which is some
kind of record.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.778
Oh.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.562
So why'’d he become
a navigator then?

28:14.562 --> 28:17.565
Well, they transferred him
for some reason.

28:17.565 --> 28:22.222
- I'’m not sure why.
- I hope it wasn'’t because
he can'’t pilot any more.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.585
Still wish you'’d have let
one of us go with you, Brice.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.761
There'’s no reason to risk
more lives than we have to.

28:39.761 --> 28:43.547
And, besides, pal,
you would just be in my way.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.419
Comet passes in 12 seconds.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.595
Engines are green
across the board.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.684
<i>Just waiting on your word.</i>

28:53.383 --> 28:56.038
All right.

28:56.038 --> 28:59.563
Seven, six, five, four,

28:59.563 --> 29:02.175
three, two...

29:02.175 --> 29:03.698
- Go for burn.
- Let'’s go for a ride.

29:16.102 --> 29:19.061
We'’re only half the relative
speed of the comet.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.671
You have to increase
acceleration, Brice,

29:20.671 --> 29:22.064
otherwise the comet will
just shoot straight past us.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.762
Yeah, I'’m working on it.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.772
All right, that'’s as much
as I can push it without
blowing the engines.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.992
Copy, we'’re at 87% of
the comet'’s relative speed.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.777
That should be enough
to stop us from ripping
apart as we tether.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.736
Should, right?
Listen, if I die,

29:41.736 --> 29:44.304
don'’t be putting me
in that NOR, yeah?

29:44.304 --> 29:45.827
I don'’t want
none of you eating me.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.786
The comet'’s about to pass.
It'’s now or never.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.396
Well, here comes
the fun part.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.485
Detaching in three, two...

29:59.232 --> 30:02.148
Hurry it up, Brice.
We'’re about to lose the comet.

30:02.148 --> 30:05.455
Brice, your stability
readouts just spiked.
Is everything all right?

30:05.455 --> 30:07.631
Yeah! Yeah, fine!

30:07.631 --> 30:09.546
Just got a little kiss
from the comet'’s atmosphere.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.548
Just a bit of space turbulence,
that'’s all.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.999
I'’m attached!

30:26.999 --> 30:28.391
You cut that close.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.524
The comet will outpace us
in three, two...

30:30.524 --> 30:32.178
- <i>Brace!</i>
- <i>...one.</i>

30:38.619 --> 30:40.882
Tether'’s secure!

30:40.882 --> 30:43.145
Not for long, Brice.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.191
When you detached
from the ark,

30:45.191 --> 30:47.758
we changed our direction
by half a degree.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.109
Shit. I must'’ve
detached too quickly,

30:50.109 --> 30:52.459
given you
an accidental push.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.069
It'’s created too much stress
on the tether.

30:54.069 --> 30:56.811
I guess I should hurry, huh?
Deploying drill.

31:07.822 --> 31:11.260
My readouts are telling me
I'’m gonna be showering soon.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.218
How'’s it look on your end?

31:22.445 --> 31:24.795
Confirmed.
Water is siphoning.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.801
Brice, we'’ve drifted
too far off course.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.325
It'’s too much
strain on the tether.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.152
<i>It'’s going to tear you apart.</i>

31:43.684 --> 31:46.121
Brice, the tether is breaking
at its weakest link-- you.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.907
I kinda figured as much
when I started to depressurize.

31:48.907 --> 31:53.650
- What'’s the water situation?
- We'’re 92% capacity.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.696
- That'’s good enough, detach.
- No, no, no, no.

31:55.696 --> 31:56.697
<i>Good enough
is not good enough.</i>

31:56.697 --> 31:58.786
- 95!
- Detach!

31:58.786 --> 32:01.963
- Get out of there!
- Guys, my EMU oxygen
is five by five!

32:01.963 --> 32:04.792
It won'’t matter
if the shuttle rips apart from
around you, Brice. Get out!

32:04.792 --> 32:07.577
This is not up for debate!
We do not need 100%!

32:07.577 --> 32:08.665
Get out of there, Brice!

32:08.665 --> 32:10.319
Not until the job is done!

32:10.319 --> 32:12.582
- 97!
- Come on.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.326
She'’s gonna hold!
Don'’t you make a liar out of me.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.113
<i>98!</i>

32:21.113 --> 32:23.115
99!

32:23.115 --> 32:25.465
- 100!
- Come on!

32:36.650 --> 32:38.739
Water tanks are full!

32:41.002 --> 32:43.483
- Whoo!
- Now, listen, I expect
a nice cold glass

32:43.483 --> 32:44.832
of comet water when I dock.

32:46.486 --> 32:48.705
Great job, guys.

32:48.705 --> 32:49.750
Well done, everyone.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.579
I'’m gonna get you
for this, Brice.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.860
Yes, all right, all right.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.907
- Well done.
- Look, look, we kind of
broke the shuttle.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.909
I'’ll add it
to the repair schedule.

33:18.909 --> 33:22.217
Yeah, we didn'’t need 100%.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.089
What, do you got
some kind of death wish?

33:24.089 --> 33:25.612
I'’ve been accused
of that, yes.

33:25.612 --> 33:29.050
Hmm. Don'’t do it again.

33:30.617 --> 33:34.360
- Right, where is my water?
- Here.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.928
Right now, that looks
better than champagne.

33:37.928 --> 33:41.584
Mmm.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.674
Now you'’ve got me thinking
how long it'’s been since
I'’ve had a real drink.

33:44.674 --> 33:47.895
You know, maybe we can
turn one of the storage
closets into a bar.

33:47.895 --> 33:50.158
One problem. No booze.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.855
Something tells me Angus
can brew something up.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.903
Oh, um, where'’d Eva go?

33:55.903 --> 33:59.733
Ah, she'’s a workaholic.
I deserve this.

33:59.733 --> 34:02.692
What do you say
we inform the crew, Lane?

34:02.692 --> 34:04.172
Are you asking my opinion?

34:04.172 --> 34:05.608
I'’m asking you
to do the honors.

34:07.958 --> 34:11.136
Attention, Ark One.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.920
This is Lieutenant
Spencer Lane.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.965
<i>We didn'’t just avert
a crisis today,</i>

34:14.965 --> 34:16.576
<i>we came together as a team.</i>

34:16.576 --> 34:19.144
For some reason,
the universe has decided

34:19.144 --> 34:20.928
to make us all
its punching bag.

34:20.928 --> 34:24.758
<i>But if we continue
to stay united,</i>

34:24.758 --> 34:26.760
<i>we will survive this,</i>

34:26.760 --> 34:29.197
<i>and we will make it
to our new home.</i>

34:29.197 --> 34:34.202
As of this moment,
all water restrictions
have been lifted.

35:02.056 --> 35:05.277
- Hi, ladies.
- Hey, this is
the women'’s shower.

35:05.277 --> 35:08.845
Well, you see,
now it'’s the co-ed shower

35:08.845 --> 35:12.806
because they, uh--
they blew up the men'’s shower.

35:12.806 --> 35:16.897
So...

35:29.866 --> 35:33.043
What fresh hell is this?

35:41.835 --> 35:44.229
Oh, sweetheart.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.319
Come with me. Come on.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.762
Girls! Girls, would you mind
passing me a soap?

35:58.286 --> 36:01.463
This was all we got back
from the doomsday party?

36:01.463 --> 36:03.857
I'’ll sweep crew quarters,
see if anyone pocketed anything.

36:03.857 --> 36:07.817
I hope find some,
otherwise we'’re about
to have a med shortage.

36:07.817 --> 36:12.082
- We need to install
something more secure.
- Have at it.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.129
Still haven'’t slept?

36:15.129 --> 36:17.305
I'’ll deal with this tomorrow
so you can have some rest now.

36:17.305 --> 36:20.090
Rest? Oh, there is no rest.

36:20.090 --> 36:23.093
I have 52 post-hibernation
physicals to review.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.534
Okay, I have a little
field training as a medic.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.927
I cannot diagnose cancer,
but I can run a PICC line

36:30.927 --> 36:34.322
or set a bone
if you ever need help.

36:34.322 --> 36:38.457
You, sir, do not know
what you just volunteered for.

36:38.457 --> 36:39.284
Thank you.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.159
Oh, God.

37:20.629 --> 37:24.154
To be clear,
I can'’t read minds.

37:24.154 --> 37:27.114
So whenever
you want to talk...

37:39.953 --> 37:44.218
I got trapped out in
a UV storm a few years back.

37:44.218 --> 37:47.003
Everyone moved inland
to get away from
the rising sea levels,

37:47.003 --> 37:50.746
but the sun still got us.

37:50.746 --> 37:55.011
I lost my sister in a UV storm.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.623
I'’d appreciate it
if you didn'’t tell
anyone about this.

37:57.623 --> 38:01.583
- Our little secret, okay?
- No problem.

38:05.761 --> 38:08.851
And that goes both ways.
Everything you tell me
is confidential.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.942
I cried it all out.
I'’m better now.

38:16.685 --> 38:19.819
Just...

38:19.819 --> 38:22.343
everyone was celebrating
and I felt...

38:22.343 --> 38:25.520
It felt wrong
to be happy, didn'’t it?

38:25.520 --> 38:29.002
- You'’re here, Harold isn't.
- Harris.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.265
It'’s what we call
survivor'’s guilt.

38:31.265 --> 38:34.050
You feel like
you don'’t deserve joy,

38:34.050 --> 38:36.966
especially not after
the way Harris died.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.970
I was surprised
to learn about you two.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.453
We kept it a secret.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.890
I never understood
why that rule even existed,

38:47.890 --> 38:51.111
that couples couldn'’t be
in the same ark.

38:51.111 --> 38:54.810
Something to do
with genetic diversity.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.683
- What?
- You know.

38:57.683 --> 39:00.686
They didn'’t want people
that were related
at the new colony

39:00.686 --> 39:03.253
so they could maximize
the number of people
that could make babies.

39:05.691 --> 39:08.215
But Harris and I
weren'’t related.
We were just in love.

39:08.215 --> 39:11.261
Why couldn'’t we be
on the same ship?

39:11.261 --> 39:14.656
I don'’t know.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.223
Maybe they wanted us
working extra hard

39:16.223 --> 39:18.486
with the promise that
loved ones would follow.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.706
Or maybe they felt
that relationships
would complicate things.

39:20.706 --> 39:25.319
- That'’s stupid.
- You wanna know
something funny?

39:25.319 --> 39:28.714
I thought you were
in a relationship
with Jasper, not Harris.

39:28.714 --> 39:33.719
- Why would you think that?
- I saw you spit on his body.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.462
I thought maybe you were
mad at him for dying.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.724
Not a logical response,

39:38.724 --> 39:41.509
but a common one
between lovers.

39:41.509 --> 39:46.688
That asshole is to blame
for Harris'’ death.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.864
If he hadn'’t replaced
the real Jasper,

39:48.864 --> 39:52.694
- Harris would still be alive.
- I'’m sorry. I didn't think.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.915
Of course you'’d hate him.

39:55.915 --> 39:59.005
Hate is not a word big enough.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.966
He deserved to have
his throat slit.

40:12.192 --> 40:15.151
Even without a brig,
we can'’t let the theft
of meds go unpunished.

40:15.151 --> 40:16.544
- I agree.
- We have to let them know

40:16.544 --> 40:18.938
this type of behavior
will not be tolerated.

40:18.938 --> 40:21.767
I'’m assigning the thieves
shifts in the mess hall.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.378
Whoa. If they can
steal meds, they'’ll
probably steal food, too.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.380
- How about latrine duty?
- Even better.

40:29.949 --> 40:34.170
You were right, by the way.
People did freak out.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.998
You'’d be well within
your right to say
"I told you so."

40:35.998 --> 40:37.957
What, after the way you threw
that guy against the wall?

40:37.957 --> 40:40.960
I honestly thought
you were gonna send him
out the airlock.

40:40.960 --> 40:45.399
You wouldn'’t have
really spaced him, right?

40:45.399 --> 40:48.750
In future,
I will take your advice
into consideration

40:48.750 --> 40:50.970
before disseminating information.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.450
- Lieutenant.
- Lieutenant.

41:54.599 --> 41:58.254
Holy shit.
I'’m at Frank's Taproom.

41:58.254 --> 42:00.692
You know, the hangout
for all the GSA officers.

42:00.692 --> 42:05.653
This biker guy wouldn'’t
take no for an answer
from this woman and, um...

42:07.220 --> 42:08.090
Check it out.
