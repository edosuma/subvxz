09:17.767 --> 09:19.767
MM-HMM, ME, TOO.
HE GOT HAIR TRANSPLANTS

09:19.767 --> 09:21.567
AND TRIED OUT
FOR<i>THE REAL WORLD.</i>

09:21.567 --> 09:24.300
I'M NOT GOING
THROUGH ANYTHING.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.700
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAID

09:25.700 --> 09:27.900
RIGHT BEFORE
HE SMASHED UP
HIS FERRARI.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.367
YOUR FATHERS ARE SILLY.

09:29.367 --> 09:33.100
HEY, DO I
OR DO I NOT GET
APE HANGERS, HUH?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.200
DAD--
BRRRRRRRR!

09:35.200 --> 09:36.600
DAD--DAD--

09:36.600 --> 09:37.834
DAD, OK, HEY!

09:37.834 --> 09:40.033
PULL THE BIKE OVER,
PULL THE BIKE OVER.

09:40.033 --> 09:43.400
ALL RIGHT. DAD, CAN I
GIVE YOU SOME TOUGH LOVE?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.867
I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.133
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
WE'RE ALL PRETTY SURE

09:48.133 --> 09:49.367
ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.834
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OK.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.567
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
IT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL.

09:52.567 --> 09:53.867
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, DAD?

09:53.867 --> 09:54.967
HE'S RIGHT, BECAUSE, SEE,

09:54.967 --> 09:57.200
WITH EVERY DAY,
WITH EVERY BREATH,

09:57.200 --> 09:58.967
YOU'RE ONE STEP
CLOSER TO DEATH.

09:58.967 --> 10:00.467
AND YOU'RE THINKING
TO YOURSELF,

10:00.467 --> 10:02.400
"I HAVEN'T LIVED."
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING--

10:02.400 --> 10:04.867
ARE YOU TRYING TO
CHEER ME UP HERE?!

10:04.867 --> 10:06.667
MR. MATTHEWS,
YOU DON'T NEED
A MOTORCYCLE

10:06.667 --> 10:07.867
TO MAKE YOU
FEEL YOUNGER.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.133
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A BABY.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.667
WHAT COULD MAKE
YOU FEEL YOUNGER
THAN THAT?

10:10.667 --> 10:12.100
YEAH, FOR THE NEXT
18 YEARS,

10:12.100 --> 10:14.033
THAT LITTLE TIGER'S
GONNA KEEP YOU RUNNING
DAY AND NIGHT.

10:14.033 --> 10:15.300
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, DAD?
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.734
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TIME

10:16.734 --> 10:19.934
FOR MOTORCYCLES AND
FAST CARS AND NOSE RINGS.

10:19.934 --> 10:22.834
YOU'VE GOT THIS NEW LITTLE
LIFE COMING INTO THE WORLD

10:22.834 --> 10:25.033
THAT'S GONNA
BE COUNTING ON YOU.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.700
GROW UP!

10:26.700 --> 10:28.200
GROW UP?
I AM GROWN UP.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.967
I'M SO GROWN UP
I DON'T KNOW IF I
CAN DO THIS AGAIN.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.200
OH, OF COURSE
YOU CAN.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.100
YOU DID A GOOD JOB
2 TIMES BEFORE.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.567
THAT'S 3.

10:35.567 --> 10:38.233
I SAID WHAT I SAID.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.500
WELL, THINGS ARE
DIFFERENT NOW.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.567
WHY?

10:40.567 --> 10:43.100
I'M DIFFERENT.
I'M OLDER.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.600
WHEN YOU WERE BORN,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.934
I REALLY LOOKED FORWARD
TO RUNNING AROUND WITH YOU,

10:46.934 --> 10:48.800
PLAYING BASEBALL
AND FOOTBALL,

10:48.800 --> 10:52.300
AND I REALLY LOOKED
FORWARD TO BEING MORE
THAN A FATHER TO YOU.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.300
I LOOKED FORWARD
TO BEING YOUR FRIEND,
WHICH I THINK I AM.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.000
OF COURSE YOU ARE, DAD.
YOU ARE MY FRIEND, MAN.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.400
WHAT AM I GONNA BE
TO THIS NEW KID?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.133
I'M JUST GONNA
BE HIS OLD MAN.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.233
THAT'S ALL
I'M GONNA BE TO HIM.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.967
JUST HIS<i>OLD </i>MAN.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.300
YOU'VE GOTTA STOP
LOOKING AT ANGELA.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.100
I THINK SHE'S
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.200
SHE'S JUST TRYING TO
MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.367
SO SHOULD YOU.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.934
YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE FUN?

11:25.934 --> 11:27.300
THEY'RE STARTING
THE KARAOKE CONTEST.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.700
DO YOU WANNA SING?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.200
KELLY, I APPRECIATE
THE OFFER,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.800
BUT I HAVE A
"NO KARAOKE" POLICY.

OK, MOMMIES AND DADDIES.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.834
EVERYONE SHOULD
EACH HAVE A BABY.

14:53.834 --> 14:57.133
NOW, THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

14:57.133 --> 14:59.700
IS LEARNING HOW TO BURP
YOUR NEWBORN.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.934
NOW, SIT THE BABY
ON YOUR KNEE,

15:01.934 --> 15:04.200
AND WITH ONE HAND
SUPPORTING THE CHEST,

15:04.200 --> 15:07.300
GENTLY PAT THE BABY ON THE BACK
WITH THE OTHER HAND.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.200
MISS, MINE BROKE.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.600
COULD YOU GET ME
THAT HEAD?

15:14.600 --> 15:18.000
I KNOW HOW TO BURP A BABY.
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.400
NOW, YOU CAN ALSO TRY
THE SHOULDER METHOD.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.500
SUPPORTING THE BABY'S HEAD,

15:22.500 --> 15:23.934
LIFT THE BABY
UP TO YOUR SHOULDER.

15:23.934 --> 15:25.367
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT?

15:25.367 --> 15:26.767
I THINK MY WATER BROKE.

15:26.767 --> 15:29.000
MISS, MINE BROKE!
WHAT?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.200
MY PARTNER.
HER WATER
JUST BROKE.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.900
THIS IS REAL!
WHAT DO WE DO?!

15:32.900 --> 15:34.600
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M FILLING IN FOR MY SISTER.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.033
ALL I KNOW ARE BURPING,
DIAPERS, AND HEE HEE HEE,
HO HO HO!

15:38.033 --> 15:39.734
OK. WHO KNOWS
WHAT TO DO?!

15:39.734 --> 15:40.900
ERIC, GO GET THE CAR.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.934
BRING IT AROUND TO THE FRONT
OF THE BUILDING.

15:42.934 --> 15:45.100
AMY, YOU JUST RIDE IN
THE BACK WITH JESSICA.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.700
ARE YOU OK?
YEAH.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.100
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN,
SOMEBODY CALL ST. VINCENT'S.

15:49.100 --> 15:53.200
JUST TELL 'EM WE'LL BE THERE
IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES, ALL RIGHT?

15:53.200 --> 15:54.400
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

16:02.500 --> 16:07.033
SHAWN, FIRST DATES
AFTER A BREAK-UP
ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULT.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.767
IT'LL GET EASIER.
NO, IT WON'T.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.900
LET'S FACE IT, THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.967
NO, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH YOU, SHAWN.

16:13.967 --> 16:16.400
IT'S JUST--I MEAN,

16:16.400 --> 16:18.400
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY HURTING
OVER ANGELA,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.467
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.800
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MEET
SOMEBODY NEW, YOU WILL.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.000
I DON'T WANNA MEET
SOMEBODY NEW.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.233
I'D SCREW
THAT UP, TOO.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.934
GUYS, IT'S ME.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.600
LOOK, I ALREADY HAD
SOMETHING GREAT,

16:31.600 --> 16:34.100
AND I KILLED IT.

16:34.100 --> 16:38.600
I'M NEVER GONNA
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
LIKE YOU GUYS.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.834
I'M NOT NORMAL.

16:39.834 --> 16:42.867
WELL, SHAWN,
<i>WE'RE </i>NOT NORMAL.

16:42.867 --> 16:44.734
I MEAN, WE'RE FREAKS.
WE ARE.

16:44.734 --> 16:47.467
WE'RE FREAKS WHO'VE LOVED
EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE 2.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.500
I KNOW.
AND BEING FRIENDS
WITH YOU GUYS

16:49.500 --> 16:51.600
HAS SHOWN ME
HOW GREAT IT IS

16:51.600 --> 16:54.100
TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.133
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.467
WHAT IF I'M INCAPABLE
OF LOVING SOMEBODY?

16:59.467 --> 17:01.000
WHAT IF I CAN'T
DO THAT?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.133
SHAWN, THAT'S CRAZY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:03.133 --> 17:04.300
NOT FOR ME.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.800
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S KINDA HARD

17:07.800 --> 17:09.967
BEING AROUND
YOU TWO, YOU KNOW?

17:09.967 --> 17:12.567
SHAWN, WHAT DO YOU
WANT US TO DO?

17:12.567 --> 17:16.600
NOTHING, NOTHING.
IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.900
CORY,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

17:18.900 --> 17:21.000
I'VE REALIZED
HOW DIFFERENT
WE REALLY ARE.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.567
I JUST NEED TIME.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.734
I GOTTA BE ALONE.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.367
I AM ALONE.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.400
HEY!

17:39.400 --> 17:40.934
HEY, WE GOT
YOUR MESSAGE.

17:40.934 --> 17:41.934
YEAH, IS
EVERYTHING OK?

17:41.934 --> 17:43.300
OH, EVERYTHING
IS MORE THAN OK.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.367
SHE'S THE MOTHER
OF A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL.

17:46.367 --> 17:49.300
AND SHE'S GOT THIS MAN
RIGHT HERE TO THANK FOR IT.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.200
ERIC.
I'M SERIOUS, DAD.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.567
YOU KNEW
JUST WHAT TO DO.

17:52.567 --> 17:55.300
OH, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I MEAN, SHE WAS IN TROUBLE.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.500
NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT WITH HER.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.967
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WITH ME, MAN.

17:57.967 --> 18:00.066
I WAS PETRIFIED.
YOU SAW. I FROZE THERE,

18:00.066 --> 18:02.700
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU KNEW WHAT TO DO,
LIKE ALWAYS.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.000
YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT
FOR THE NEW BABY, TOO.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.367
YEAH, THE VERY LUCKY
NEW BABY

18:06.367 --> 18:07.800
TO HAVE A GREAT DAD
LIKE YOU.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.300
I HOPE SO.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.500
SO YOU STILL GETTING
THE HARLEY?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.300
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT BORROWING IT.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.734
SORRY, JACK.
YOU CAN BORROW
MY STATION WAGON.

18:15.734 --> 18:19.000
THAT'S GREAT. THE WOMEN
ARE REALLY GONNA LOVE THAT.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.200
SO THIS MID-LIFE
CRISIS

18:21.200 --> 18:22.567
IS ALL ABOUT
THE BABY, RIGHT?

18:22.567 --> 18:24.200
THERE'S NEVER BEEN
ANY QUESTION

18:24.200 --> 18:26.300
ABOUT HOW MUCH I WANT
THE BABY, AMY.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.734
I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT HOW MUCH

18:27.734 --> 18:29.300
THE BABY'S
GONNA WANT ME.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.133
I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA BE
TOO TIRED TO PLAY CATCH

18:32.133 --> 18:34.100
OR TEACH HIM
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.200
I'M WORRIED I'M NOT
GONNA HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY

18:36.200 --> 18:38.800
TO RUN AROUND
WITH HIM THE WAY WE DID
WITH THE OTHER KIDS.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.734
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT MAKES YOU
A GOOD FATHER?

18:40.734 --> 18:42.800
I MEAN, YEAH, SURE,
YOU TAUGHT ME HOW
TO SWING A BAT,

18:42.800 --> 18:44.400
BUT ANY
LITTLE LEAGUE COACH
COULD DO THAT.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.767
IT WAS MORE
IMPORTANT THAT YOU
WERE THERE FOR ME

18:46.767 --> 18:47.767
AFTER I STRUCK OUT.

18:47.767 --> 18:48.767
YOU MADE ME
FEEL BETTER.

18:48.767 --> 18:51.000
YOU WERE ALWAYS
THERE FOR ME, MAN,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.700
JUST TO LISTEN
TO ME,

18:52.700 --> 18:54.100
TO GIVE ME ADVICE,
YOU KNOW,

18:54.100 --> 18:56.100
AND TO HELP ME
GET THROUGH STUFF,

18:56.100 --> 18:57.767
JUST LIKE YOU
DID TODAY.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.367
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BE TOO OLD
TO DO THAT.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.233
WELL, I KNOW I'M NEVER
GONNA BE TOO OLD

19:05.233 --> 19:08.200
TO GIVE MY SON A HUG.
NO, YOU REALLY ARE. NO.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.200
HEY, EVERYONE,
I PROPOSE A TOAST.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.667
A TOAST--TO NEW BABIES
EVERYWHERE.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.367
All: TO NEW BABIES
EVERYWHERE.

19:14.367 --> 19:15.500
AND THE OLDER ONES.

19:18.934 --> 19:21.600
ALL I'M SAYING IS, YOU GUYS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.100
IT WAS A MIRACLE.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.567
AH, MAN. I WANT TO HAVE
AT LEAST 5 KIDS.

19:25.567 --> 19:29.300
5?! I WANT, LIKE,
ONE, MAYBE 2.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.934
I WANT 5.
SO DO I.

19:31.934 --> 19:34.867
WELL, TOPANGA TELLS ME
THAT SHE WANTS TO HAVE KIDS

19:34.867 --> 19:36.200
AS SOON AS SHE GETS MARRIED.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.300
WAIT A MINUTE. IT TAKES
9 MONTHS TO HAVE A BABY.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.367
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN 9 MONTHS.

19:42.367 --> 19:43.867
I BETTER GO BRUSH
MY TEETH.
