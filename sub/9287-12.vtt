00:09.313 --> 00:12.703
Thanks for playing. It's always a pleasure.

00:12.793 --> 00:17.230
- Who's next? Sketchy, what d'you say?
- No. I already owe you two pay cheques.

00:17.313 --> 00:19.508
- I'll let you break.
- No. Nope.

00:19.593 --> 00:22.949
I'll play left-handed. You can blindfold me.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.786
- No, man.
- No? OK.

00:25.873 --> 00:27.704
Nobody likes a show-off, Alec.

00:27.793 --> 00:32.150
Max. 50 bucks, and you get to humble
your old buddy Alec. What d'you say?

00:32.232 --> 00:34.303
- You're all right.
- Thanks anyway.

00:34.393 --> 00:36.861
Anybody? You? You? You?

00:36.953 --> 00:41.026
Come on! It's not that dif...
Logan, what d'you say, pal?

00:41.113 --> 00:44.344
Wanna play me in a little game of pool?

00:45.433 --> 00:47.424
- I break?
- Yeah.

00:49.193 --> 00:51.582
Rack 'em.

00:52.473 --> 00:54.464
Move over.

01:01.753 --> 01:03.744
Excuse me.

01:13.153 --> 01:14.905
- Alec.
- Yeah?

01:14.993 --> 01:16.984
Could you stand back?

01:19.473 --> 01:21.464
Well, well, well.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.509
Not too shabby.

01:24.593 --> 01:27.426
Can I... get you another beer?

01:28.593 --> 01:29.992
No.

01:30.993 --> 01:33.382
You sure?

01:33.473 --> 01:35.862
He's gonna run it now.

01:54.993 --> 01:59.544
I just wanna play it. It's like a guitar,
you know? It's beautiful.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.306
- Corner pocket.
- Sure you don't wanna try a bank shot?

02:02.393 --> 02:04.111
Oh, no. No, no. I'm sure.

02:07.473 --> 02:09.464
Maybe not that sure.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.583
Tricky shot.

02:21.753 --> 02:24.426
- You can do it.
- Sketchy, where's the love?

02:24.513 --> 02:27.505
Guys. Beat it.

02:33.433 --> 02:35.742
You gotta admit, that was pretty cool.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.064
Silly boys playing with
their sticks and balls. I may vomit.

02:39.153 --> 02:42.304
Hey, Logan. Another 50 bucks
says you miss this shot.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.825
You're on.

03:00.793 --> 03:02.624
- Nice game.
- Thanks.

03:02.713 --> 03:04.863
You rock!

03:05.633 --> 03:07.703
Go wash your hands.

03:07.793 --> 03:09.784
What? I'm clean.

03:12.033 --> 03:15.070
- What's going on?
- The whole love bug dealio.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.543
After he beat your ass, Max gave him a beer
and they might have touched.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.589
Dosed him with the virus.

03:20.673 --> 03:23.904
Now would not be a good time
for one of your smart-ass remarks.

03:23.993 --> 03:27.065
Hey, I hate to lose,
but I'm not wishing the guy dead.

03:27.153 --> 03:30.862
- What did I just say?
- I was being serious.

03:33.033 --> 03:35.024
I'm OK.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.870
I could have killed you
over a stupid game of pool.

03:38.953 --> 03:42.184
I thought it was a very satisfying
game of pool, actually.

03:42.273 --> 03:44.953
- You wanna get a drink?
- Better not risk it.

03:44.953 --> 03:46.272
- You wanna get a drink?
- Better not risk it.

03:46.353 --> 03:48.344
I'm gonna go home.

04:14.033 --> 04:17.024
Good boy, Chopper. Way to stand guard.

04:28.393 --> 04:33.228
Back in the day, they'd give you
10 cent a can. 10 cent!

04:33.313 --> 04:38.103
Nowadays, you'd be lucky
if you get 10 cent a pound.

04:38.193 --> 04:43.426
I'm tellin' you, Chopper, it's gettin' harder
and harder to make a livin' every day.

04:46.513 --> 04:48.902
You hear that?

04:50.513 --> 04:53.027
Stay.

04:53.113 --> 04:55.911
Stay, Chopper. Stay.

05:21.233 --> 05:25.909
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.984
Then she escaped.

05:28.073 --> 05:32.430
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:32.513 --> 05:34.822
she is haunted by her past.

05:34.913 --> 05:39.907
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

06:15.273 --> 06:17.787
F divided by xy.

06:17.873 --> 06:21.548
No, xz. It's gotta be right.

06:21.633 --> 06:25.228
That Manticore creep could've been
onto something and didn't know it.

06:25.313 --> 06:28.225
Sorry I painted over your virus papers, Max.

06:28.313 --> 06:30.827
It's OK. I can still make out most of it.

06:30.913 --> 06:33.825
It's just this function that's screwing me up.

06:34.753 --> 06:37.950
Fx-1 times delta x equals...

06:38.793 --> 06:40.545
What is that?

06:42.193 --> 06:44.184
It's a squiggle.

06:45.153 --> 06:49.066
- Squiggle.
- Could be an approximate sign.

06:49.153 --> 06:53.624
Fx-1 times delta x
is approximate to delta q.

06:53.713 --> 06:57.706
The messenger RNA would codify
the interruption in the protein strand,

06:57.793 --> 07:02.309
the DNA wouldn't be able to replicate,
and the virus would hit a dead end.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.145
No.

07:06.553 --> 07:09.750
It's a squiggle. See?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.464
Yeah.

07:14.353 --> 07:16.503
Still, it makes sense.

07:16.593 --> 07:19.391
So the virus bitch is going down?

07:19.473 --> 07:22.067
Could be.

07:22.153 --> 07:27.432
You know, I never would've caught this
if you hadn't painted over my papers.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.183
You gotta blaze?

07:30.273 --> 07:32.628
I'm gonna see if I'm on the right track.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.624
Thanks, big fella.

07:38.673 --> 07:41.790
Why are you shaking your head.
Are my calculations wrong?

07:41.873 --> 07:45.309
Well, they're not so much wrong as not right.

07:45.393 --> 07:46.382
Great.

07:46.473 --> 07:49.146
You never told me
where this virus came from.

07:49.233 --> 07:52.225
Do you mind my asking?

07:52.313 --> 07:54.304
A government agency gave it to me,

07:54.393 --> 07:57.510
hoping I'd give it
to a friend of mine they wanted to kill.

07:57.593 --> 07:59.788
You don't wanna tell me, don't tell me.

07:59.873 --> 08:02.990
Whatever. Serves me right
for getting my hopes up.

08:03.073 --> 08:05.985
Hey, you're not gonna start cryin', are you?

08:06.633 --> 08:08.464
- Just give me my papers.
- Hold on.

08:08.553 --> 08:11.226
Your numbers were off a bit,
but the theory's viable.

08:11.313 --> 08:15.101
- Which part?
- Luring the virus into a protein dead end.

08:15.193 --> 08:20.426
It has a kind of Pied-Piper-ness to it,
with a little Chuck Heston thrown in there.

08:20.513 --> 08:23.505
"Take that, you damn dirty virus!"

08:26.513 --> 08:28.822
So you're saying you can make it work?

08:28.913 --> 08:33.191
Yeah. Yeah, all I need
is a blood sample and...

08:33.273 --> 08:34.751
20,000 dollars.

08:37.472 --> 08:42.183
You ask me, 20 large is still a small price
to pay for you and Logan to get together.

08:42.273 --> 08:46.346
I just wanna know I'm not gonna kill the guy
if, say, I touch his hand by accident.

08:46.433 --> 08:51.826
Or if, say, you spend a long weekend making
hot monkey love to the man - by accident.

08:52.673 --> 08:55.312
Does he know about the man with the cure?

08:55.393 --> 09:00.069
I'm gonna try to get the cash first. I don't
wanna have to owe him if this falls through.

09:00.153 --> 09:02.144
Where you gonna get the money?

09:02.233 --> 09:05.589
- I'm gonna sell my soul.
- There's the devil.

09:09.793 --> 09:12.466
- What are you doing tonight?
- And why do you ask?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.544
Got word from this fence I know.

09:14.633 --> 09:18.342
There's a collector willing to pay
top dollar for Star Wars: Episode VII.

09:18.433 --> 09:22.665
After the Pulse, they shut down production.
This is the only footage that exists.

09:22.753 --> 09:25.870
- Is that the one where Captain Kirk dies?
- I guess.

09:25.953 --> 09:29.628
Anyway, the reel's locked up in a vault
at the Fox Building in Belltown.

09:29.713 --> 09:32.864
Max, are you asking me
to steal something with you?

09:32.953 --> 09:34.944
It's a two-man job.

09:36.033 --> 09:40.072
I'm shocked. I don't do
that kinda stuff any more, Max.

09:40.153 --> 09:42.747
You yourself showed me
the error of my ways.

09:42.833 --> 09:43.393
- Did I mention your take was 20 grand?
- What time do I pick you up?

09:43.393 --> 09:47.147
- Did I mention your take was 20 grand?
- What time do I pick you up?

09:59.473 --> 10:02.067
Do you have to do that in the kitchen?

10:03.113 --> 10:05.991
- My gums are killing me.
- Well, rinse out the sink.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.861
- Mom, I'm a vegetarian.
- And I want pizza.

10:09.953 --> 10:15.664
You both are gonna eat this meat loaf,
and that is final. Irving, would you tell them?

10:15.753 --> 10:17.186
Somebody kill me.

10:26.353 --> 10:31.063
There's security stationed here, here and here.
They do rounds in rotations.

10:31.153 --> 10:34.668
We'll have 30 seconds when
the entrance guard relieves the lobby guard.

10:34.753 --> 10:37.870
Past that point, smooth sailing.
In and out in five minutes.

10:37.953 --> 10:41.662
Does this qualify as stealing from a bad guy,
or do you have a new handy excuse

10:41.753 --> 10:44.631
for swiping something
that doesn't belong to you?

10:44.713 --> 10:48.626
People have the right to see this stuff.
It shouldn't be locked up in a vault.

10:48.713 --> 10:51.705
Of course, yeah.
That Murdoch is one evil fiend.

10:51.793 --> 10:55.581
Just stick to the plan. Trust me, it'll be
the easiest money you've ever made.

10:56.673 --> 10:59.870
"Trust me" she says.
"We'll be in and out in five minutes."

10:59.953 --> 11:02.342
- We've been in here an hour.
- Shut up!

11:03.513 --> 11:06.505
Check and see if the guards are still there.

11:06.593 --> 11:08.231
- Still there.
- How many?

11:08.313 --> 11:10.588
- Two.
- Two? Max, I think we could take 'em.

11:10.673 --> 11:16.066
Not before they trip the alarm.
Better wait for the next shift change.

11:17.953 --> 11:21.548
- Wanna know what I'm doing with my share?
- No.

11:22.633 --> 11:26.911
Fine. Rude, but fine.
What are you gonna do with yours?

11:26.993 --> 11:29.507
- Donate it to charity.
- Yeah, right.

11:29.593 --> 11:33.472
I'm thinking, what?
New motorcycle? New apartment?

11:33.553 --> 11:36.067
New boyfriend?

11:36.793 --> 11:39.785
New DNA markers for current boyfriend.

11:39.873 --> 11:43.024
He's not my boyfriend.

11:43.113 --> 11:47.823
I can't believe this. I've been stuck here
for over an hour to facilitate you having sex.

11:47.913 --> 11:51.428
- That's what I've been reduced to. I'm a pimp.
- It's not even like that.

11:51.513 --> 11:56.189
Tell me that he's worth all this trouble, Max.
Tell me how he rocks your world.

11:56.273 --> 11:58.787
Something. Maxie?

12:00.193 --> 12:02.184
You and Logan have done it, right?

12:02.273 --> 12:07.791
I mean, before the whole virus thing,
you knew each other for what, a year? Max?

12:07.873 --> 12:09.864
Could you two be more lame?

12:09.953 --> 12:13.263
Not that this is any of your business, but...

12:13.353 --> 12:15.992
with me and Logan,
it was just never the right time.

12:16.073 --> 12:18.348
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:18.433 --> 12:22.392
I can see how the right time
might elude you... for a year.

12:28.073 --> 12:30.792
Guards are gone.
Let's get the film and get outta here.

12:30.873 --> 12:32.431
Great idea.

12:32.513 --> 12:35.710
...97, 98, 99, 20,000.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.909
OK. So let's do this.

12:37.993 --> 12:42.271
Roll up your sleeve. The immunoglobulin's
gonna take a lap through your system.

12:42.353 --> 12:47.108
It's gonna neutralise any virulent cells
in your bloodstream. There you go.

12:47.193 --> 12:49.353
How do I know it worked?

12:49.353 --> 12:49.785
How do I know it worked?

12:54.873 --> 12:56.670
See those little green circles?

12:56.753 --> 13:01.349
Those are antibodies, completely encasing
the virus nuclei and protein coating.

13:01.433 --> 13:06.063
- So it's working?
- This thing's completely dead in its tracks.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.303
I'm cured. I can't believe it.

13:08.393 --> 13:12.022
Yeah, this thing couldn't
hurt a flea now. It's totally...

13:15.673 --> 13:17.470
What do you mean?

13:17.553 --> 13:21.592
- This virus is mutating.
- Mutating how?

13:21.673 --> 13:27.066
They're eating through the protein coating.
After that the virus is back in business.

13:28.273 --> 13:31.948
- You're not gonna cry, are you?
- How long until the coating is history?

13:32.033 --> 13:35.389
Well, at the rate they're going,
13, maybe 14 hours.

13:35.473 --> 13:38.067
I wouldn't put it past 12,
just to be on the safe side.

13:38.153 --> 13:42.544
I can say with complete confidence
you'll be virus-free for 12 hours.

13:52.553 --> 13:54.862
Got a minute?

13:54.953 --> 13:57.342
What did you want to talk about?

13:58.353 --> 14:02.790
Let me ask you a... hypothetical question.

14:02.873 --> 14:04.670
Those are my favourite kind.

14:04.753 --> 14:10.988
Supposing, just supposing...
I found a temporary cure for the virus.

14:11.073 --> 14:13.064
Is there such a thing?

14:13.153 --> 14:15.667
That's where the supposing part comes in.

14:15.753 --> 14:20.349
OK. Hypothetically, how long
would this temporary cure last?

14:25.353 --> 14:27.548
10 hours and 50 minutes.

14:31.353 --> 14:33.423
You're serious.

14:36.273 --> 14:40.061
So we can touch and nothing will happen?

14:41.353 --> 14:45.505
I don't know about nothing,
but you won't die.

14:46.713 --> 14:48.704
Oh, my...

14:50.033 --> 14:51.432
Max.

14:51.513 --> 14:55.904
We have to think about this.
Because when it's over, it's over.

14:55.993 --> 14:57.984
No repeats.

15:00.513 --> 15:03.664
- We'd be back where we started.
- Exactly.

15:04.833 --> 15:10.385
10 hours seems like a long time,
but it isn't. Not really.

15:12.713 --> 15:16.069
It'll have to be long enough.

15:16.153 --> 15:19.031
I was hoping you'd say that.

15:19.713 --> 15:23.103
- We've got 10 hours.
- Evidently.

15:23.193 --> 15:26.185
We've been waiting for the right time.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.511
Here it is.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.504
I don't...

16:14.193 --> 16:17.583
I can't believe
I'm gonna be all girlie on you, but...

16:20.153 --> 16:23.031
I don't wanna blow this on a quickie.

16:23.113 --> 16:25.104
It should be perfect.

16:27.593 --> 16:29.982
Perfect.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.462
How about a perfect quickie?

16:35.473 --> 16:37.464
Open this.

16:44.913 --> 16:47.302
Barkeep. Another Scotch.

16:47.953 --> 16:50.945
And a tequila shot for the pretty blonde.

16:52.713 --> 16:55.750
- That's all right. I was just leaving.
- Come on.

17:04.193 --> 17:08.584
Once you hear the good news about Max
and Logan, you might be wanting that drink.

17:08.673 --> 17:10.664
What news?

17:12.153 --> 17:14.541
Why don't you fortify yourself?

17:20.193 --> 17:21.387
Bottoms up.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.988
So how long were you and Alec
stuck in the closet?

17:25.073 --> 17:29.351
About an hour.
He was yapping the entire time.

17:30.393 --> 17:32.953
He's a yapper.

17:33.033 --> 17:38.266
Yeah, stuck in a closet with Alec - you're
pretty much describing my worst nightmare.

17:38.353 --> 17:41.345
It was worth it, though. It got me here.

17:45.393 --> 17:47.384
It feels like old times.

17:48.353 --> 17:50.344
Better.

17:55.833 --> 17:58.586
- Logan and Max.
- Max and Logan.

17:58.673 --> 18:00.982
Every happiness.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.906
Wonder what they're doing right now.

18:06.993 --> 18:09.029
You know what I mean.

18:09.113 --> 18:11.866
Logan's so romantic.
I bet he made her dinner.

18:11.953 --> 18:15.707
Wine, candles. I bet it's perfect.

18:15.793 --> 18:17.431
That sounds like them.

18:17.513 --> 18:22.189
I mean, "Why consummate two years of
unbridled passion when we can have pasta?"

18:22.273 --> 18:25.663
You're a pig.
You don't know anything about love.

18:25.753 --> 18:28.551
I know more than you think.
Besides, you're a liar.

18:28.633 --> 18:30.430
How so?

18:30.513 --> 18:34.347
Because you don't wish them happiness.
You want Logan for yourself.

18:34.433 --> 18:37.743
You had it all dialled in when
Max was at Manticore, presumed dead.

18:37.833 --> 18:42.190
You and Logan, doing your hero thing,
spending hours in his fancy apartment,

18:42.273 --> 18:45.071
all tuned up about the ways of the world.

18:45.153 --> 18:47.621
It was a good time for you, right?

18:47.713 --> 18:52.343
Yeah, he was thinking about Max
every second of every day.

18:52.433 --> 18:54.708
He never believed she was dead.

18:54.793 --> 18:59.105
And when she came back,
he was the happiest I've ever seen him.

18:59.193 --> 19:01.661
Yeah, until the virus thing.

19:01.753 --> 19:05.633
Even with the virus,
they never gave up on each other.

19:05.713 --> 19:09.991
And no matter how I feel about it,
I have to respect that.

19:10.073 --> 19:13.986
Because that, my friend, is true love.

19:14.073 --> 19:18.589
Yeah, right. Have they ever
even once said "I love you"?

19:18.673 --> 19:23.110
No. Max would choke on the words.
Logan, he'd say it, in an email.

19:23.793 --> 19:29.151
"He's not my boyfriend. We were never
even like that. It was never the right time."

19:29.233 --> 19:33.146
No, Logan is a repressed WASP
and Max is a broken toy.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.428
The two of them will never work out together.

19:35.513 --> 19:37.629
- And you are cynical.
- No.

19:37.713 --> 19:43.026
I'm someone who believes in going after
what he wants, and damn the consequences.

19:43.113 --> 19:48.506
When you've been dead 100 years, little girl,
you have only just begun to be dead.

19:50.353 --> 19:52.583
We're living on borrowed time.

19:52.673 --> 19:56.586
If you don't put your heart out on the line,
you're never really living at all.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.870
If I loved someone, I'd tell her.

19:59.953 --> 20:02.513
And if I wanted someone,

20:02.593 --> 20:05.426
then I would let her know, straight up.

20:06.033 --> 20:07.352
Asha.

20:08.793 --> 20:11.261
I want you.

20:11.353 --> 20:13.947
Come home with me.

20:26.793 --> 20:30.581
"Warning. Use only in well-ventilated areas."

20:30.673 --> 20:32.664
"Headaches, dizziness."

20:35.313 --> 20:38.783
"Could cause harmful health risk."

21:22.753 --> 21:25.267
Gossamer.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.343
Gossamer. Smell Gossamer.

22:06.673 --> 22:10.268
All right, man. Who are you
and why are you... Oh, my God!

22:11.633 --> 22:13.863
Oh, my God!

22:24.353 --> 22:26.344
Pretty wack.

22:45.953 --> 22:47.944
Max.

22:49.033 --> 22:53.424
There's something I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time.

22:55.433 --> 22:58.027
Yeah. Me, too.

23:01.753 --> 23:03.869
You first.

23:03.953 --> 23:05.625
Max, I...

23:07.113 --> 23:09.468
Stop getting busy, please.

23:09.553 --> 23:12.545
Joshua, what are you doing here?

23:12.633 --> 23:14.942
- Gossamer.
- What?

23:15.033 --> 23:16.393
On the loose. He's hurting people.

23:16.393 --> 23:17.951
On the loose. He's hurting people.

23:18.033 --> 23:21.821
Gossamer. OK. What is that,
some kind of Manticore thing?

23:21.913 --> 23:24.950
Max and Joshua have to stop him.
That's the plan. Come.

23:25.033 --> 23:27.183
No. Joshua, not now.

23:27.273 --> 23:31.744
Can't this wait... nine hours and 20 minutes?

23:32.753 --> 23:35.313
- No. Now.
- Joshua, you don't understand.

23:38.753 --> 23:42.428
Look, if this thing is hurting people, then...

23:43.473 --> 23:45.668
Can my life suck any harder?

23:47.793 --> 23:49.784
Here we are.

23:52.193 --> 23:54.582
Make yourself at home. I'll get us a drink.

23:54.673 --> 23:56.504
Thanks.

23:56.593 --> 23:58.584
My feet are killing me.

24:02.393 --> 24:04.623
I got this from an old guy on the waterfront

24:04.713 --> 24:09.184
who specialises in pre-Pulse
small batch, of all things.

24:09.273 --> 24:14.791
Turn on some music. I got that tricked-out
stereo out of a dumpster, if you can believe it.

24:16.593 --> 24:19.232
Asha?

24:50.273 --> 24:52.992
Are you sure he's dangerous?

24:53.073 --> 24:56.031
- Max, he's hurting people.
- Then we have to stop him.

24:56.113 --> 25:00.186
- Well, first we gotta find him.
- He's in the sewers by my house.

25:00.273 --> 25:04.869
That makes sense. If it can't move in
plain sight, it'd have to use the sewer system.

25:04.953 --> 25:07.865
- Doesn't narrow things down.
- Where'd you catch up with it?

25:07.953 --> 25:10.547
- Little Debbie's.
- Bakery.

25:10.633 --> 25:10.713
Sector Five.

25:10.713 --> 25:13.068
Sector Five.

25:13.153 --> 25:16.509
Our best bet's to start there
and backtrack towards Joshua's place.

25:16.593 --> 25:20.222
- That's a lot of ground to cover.
- Max and Joshua can cover ground.

25:20.313 --> 25:22.144
- No.
- Yeah.

25:22.233 --> 25:25.589
No. I can't chase this thing down
and worry about you too.

25:25.673 --> 25:28.107
You know it's not safe for you out there.

25:30.193 --> 25:33.344
- Should I ask for Alec's help?
- That's an idea.

25:33.433 --> 25:39.542
I'll talk to Matt Sung, see if there are other
reports about this thing, figure out its MO.

25:39.633 --> 25:42.625
We've only got eight hours and 53 minutes.

25:51.913 --> 25:55.303
- I always feel like I'm kissing you goodbye.
- Go.

26:05.353 --> 26:07.344
Alec?

26:10.193 --> 26:12.184
Wake up.

26:12.273 --> 26:14.503
- Hey, Max.
- Asha?

26:17.833 --> 26:20.825
- What?
- I need your help. Can you get dressed?

26:22.513 --> 26:24.504
OK.

26:25.393 --> 26:28.908
- Please hurry.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.667
One of the Gossamers
is loose in the big city?

26:32.753 --> 26:35.313
- There's more than one?
- There's a bunch of 'em.

26:35.393 --> 26:38.032
Manticore used 'em
to track down targets on scent.

26:38.113 --> 26:41.788
X4 gone rogue, give Gossamer
one of his T-shirts, let him smell it -

26:41.873 --> 26:43.784
wouldn't stop till the kid was found.

26:43.873 --> 26:46.785
- What'd he do once he found him?
- It depends.

26:46.873 --> 26:51.901
Some were bred for retrieval, so they'd
disable the subject and wait for the handlers.

26:51.993 --> 26:55.668
Others were bred for elimination.
Those were some pretty bad guys.

26:55.753 --> 26:57.505
I hope it's not one of those.

26:57.593 --> 27:02.109
Either way, they all have this goo that shoots
out of their mouth. It stuns the victims.

27:02.193 --> 27:05.583
- Goo? That's terrific.
- Should be fun.

27:05.673 --> 27:09.461
- So, where do you wanna start looking?
- The sewers.

27:09.553 --> 27:12.829
I haven't got to crawl in a stinkin' tunnel
with you for two weeks.

27:12.913 --> 27:16.952
- It's not like I had anything better to do.
- Sorry this interrupts your evening.

27:17.033 --> 27:20.662
Here I am, hanging out at Crash Bar
with Asha, who I hardly know,

27:20.753 --> 27:22.630
and it just seemed the right time.

27:22.713 --> 27:26.422
How about you? Come on.
Now that the virus is out of the way, right?

27:26.513 --> 27:28.629
Just get in the sewers.

27:30.073 --> 27:32.064
You guys crack me up.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.432
Hello.

27:37.513 --> 27:39.868
Logan, hey. We were just talking about you.

27:39.953 --> 27:42.069
Hey, you called me, pal.

27:42.153 --> 27:44.383
Yeah, she's right here.

27:45.313 --> 27:47.144
Hey.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.430
Eight hours and ten minutes.
Tell me you got something.

27:50.513 --> 27:55.428
Talked to Sung. There was another attack
about four miles west of Joshua's place.

27:55.513 --> 27:58.425
- Irving Green.
- Any connections between the two victims?

27:58.513 --> 28:04.543
Kind of. I talked to Irving's wife, and she
mentioned he'd had a cavity filled yesterday.

28:06.193 --> 28:10.186
The guy that Joshua saw grabbed, Hal
Johnson, had also just been to the dentist.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.707
- Same dentist?
- Dr Carlos Rabell.

28:14.033 --> 28:16.467
Alec says Gossamer's
trained to sniff for stuff.

28:16.553 --> 28:20.626
Maybe whatever Manticore
trained him to find is at the dentist's.

28:20.713 --> 28:24.991
All right. We're going underground.
Leave a message in case I don't have a signal.

28:25.353 --> 28:27.867
Gossamer going down?

28:27.953 --> 28:29.750
Yeah.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.552
I'm gonna check out a lead.

28:33.273 --> 28:37.391
- Remember what Max said?
- Stay put, it's not safe, blah blah blah.

28:37.473 --> 28:42.501
That's right. So, you lay low,
and don't touch anything,

28:43.553 --> 28:45.828
and there's some food in the fridge.

29:21.593 --> 29:26.303
Eight hours to be with the girl of my dreams,
and I'm at the dentist's office.

29:37.553 --> 29:39.544
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:44.913 --> 29:48.030
You got an appointment?
You keep checking the time.

29:48.113 --> 29:50.627
Don't worry about it.
Are you and blondie an item,

29:50.713 --> 29:53.989
or is she just another one
in Alec's long line of conquests?

29:54.073 --> 29:57.952
Asha's a good kid.
For the record, nothing happened.

29:58.033 --> 30:00.024
Why? Do you wanna double-date?

30:00.113 --> 30:02.104
Yeah, sounds like fun.

30:23.433 --> 30:28.223
This is Alec's cellphone.
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.

30:28.313 --> 30:35.025
It's me. I know what Gossamer's after. It
doesn't get us any closer to his location, but...

30:41.713 --> 30:45.626
This has been a fun night, Max.
I wanna thank you, really.

30:46.713 --> 30:49.864
First I get to spend an hour and a half
with you in a dark closet.

30:49.953 --> 30:53.832
- Now my evening's gonna end in this sewer.
- Shut up.

30:53.913 --> 30:57.030
Boy, two years of waiting's
really made you tense.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.869
Oh, look.

30:59.953 --> 31:01.830
It's here.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.788
Check this place out.

31:19.873 --> 31:21.513
We should split up. Be careful.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.502
We should split up. Be careful.

31:24.593 --> 31:27.903
Gossamer! Here, boy!

31:42.553 --> 31:44.942
Come on, Logan, pick up.

31:49.513 --> 31:51.504
Logan?

32:03.473 --> 32:05.225
Logan, wake up.

32:27.233 --> 32:31.192
- Are we there yet?
- Alec, can you get out?

32:31.273 --> 32:34.071
Yeah, I thought I'd hang around
cos it's so comfy.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.826
- I can't move either.
- Where are we?

32:36.913 --> 32:39.985
Some junkyard.
Gossamer must've brought you here.

32:40.073 --> 32:42.428
Hey! Is somebody there?

32:43.793 --> 32:46.068
- What was that?
- Hey, get us outta here!

32:46.153 --> 32:47.905
- Who's "us"?
- I'm Hal.

32:47.993 --> 32:50.826
That's Irving. Then there's Gordie.

32:50.913 --> 32:53.427
- I own the place.
- Get us outta here!

32:53.513 --> 32:55.743
Before that thing comes back and eats us!

32:55.833 --> 32:59.826
Gossamer's a herbivore.
He only kills for sport.

32:59.913 --> 33:04.270
That's good to know. We're gonna
get everybody out. Just hang tight.

33:05.113 --> 33:07.581
Do you have any idea what Gossamer wants?

33:07.673 --> 33:11.871
It turns out the dentist
was using Kevaral to fill cavities.

33:11.953 --> 33:12.942
What's Kevaral?

33:13.033 --> 33:16.230
It's a material used in weapon casings
and body-armour plating.

33:16.313 --> 33:21.148
I guess Manticore trained this thing to track
down enemy soldiers by targeting the stuff.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.986
Great. I'm gonna die with
armour plating in my teeth.

33:24.073 --> 33:27.668
- I don't wanna die!
- No one's gonna die.

33:27.753 --> 33:29.152
I hope.

33:29.233 --> 33:33.545
This quack didn't fill your cavities.
Why'd it go after you?

33:33.633 --> 33:36.306
I was holding Kevaral when it slimed me.

33:36.393 --> 33:41.911
Can we just concentrate on getting outta here
before this goo monster comes back?

33:42.833 --> 33:45.427
Joshua. He'll get us out.

33:46.673 --> 33:50.063
Joshua. Who we told
not to leave my apartment.

34:10.233 --> 34:12.110
Max?

34:12.193 --> 34:13.989
Logan?

34:15.193 --> 34:17.502
I can't believe how screwed up all this is.

34:17.592 --> 34:19.743
I know.

34:19.833 --> 34:23.587
And to think I thought my night
was gonna end up in a sewer. I wish.

34:23.672 --> 34:26.027
For the last time, shut up.

34:26.112 --> 34:30.629
It's your fault that I am sitting here
in this monster saliva to begin with!

34:30.713 --> 34:33.670
- It's not her fault.
- Yeah, right. It's not my fault.

34:33.753 --> 34:35.869
It's just my life.

34:35.953 --> 34:39.547
Even if we get outta this,
what happens tomorrow, Logan?

34:41.233 --> 34:45.862
We still have the Nomlies,
and Manticore, and all fate's against us.

34:45.953 --> 34:49.467
I should've known that one night
was just too damn much to ask.

34:52.273 --> 34:55.150
How much time do we have left?

34:55.233 --> 34:57.588
Not enough.

34:57.673 --> 35:02.110
Max, it wouldn't have been enough anyway.

35:02.193 --> 35:05.310
- We knew that.
- Whoa.

35:05.393 --> 35:08.351
Call me slow on the uptake,
but am I getting the impression

35:08.433 --> 35:10.993
that this virus thing is still hanging around?

35:11.073 --> 35:13.064
Shut up.

35:19.713 --> 35:21.704
Logan?

35:38.313 --> 35:40.304
Gossamer.

35:41.353 --> 35:43.273
Max and Alec.

35:47.833 --> 35:50.984
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

35:53.033 --> 35:54.785
Max? Logan?

35:54.873 --> 35:58.946
Joshua. Joshua, in here! Joshua!

35:59.033 --> 36:01.786
- Hey, buddy.
- Joshua! Get us out.

36:01.873 --> 36:04.671
- I didn't stay put.
- That's OK. Come on.

36:04.753 --> 36:07.347
- Come on, hurry up!
- Get us outta here! Hurry!

36:10.473 --> 36:11.622
Come on!

36:11.713 --> 36:13.305
- You OK?
- Yeah.

36:13.393 --> 36:15.270
Hey, buddy. Back here. Come on!

36:15.353 --> 36:18.311
- Kevaral! Where's the Kevaral?
- By the phone.

36:25.753 --> 36:27.471
Gossamer!

36:49.233 --> 36:51.793
Want some of this?
Come on! Come and get it!

36:56.233 --> 36:58.383
Come on, come on.

36:58.473 --> 37:00.543
That's right, that's right.

37:01.033 --> 37:03.501
Come on. This way.

37:03.593 --> 37:06.551
Nasty-ass mutant son of a...

37:41.953 --> 37:44.626
That oughta hold him for a while.

37:59.673 --> 38:02.028
- What was that thing?
- Not to worry.

38:02.113 --> 38:06.345
There is a logical explanation
for everything that happened here tonight.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.469
Just give me a minute.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.862
Hang tight.

38:17.633 --> 38:21.945
Come on, let's clear outta here.
Let's give these two some breathing room.

38:24.713 --> 38:26.704
You all right?

38:31.633 --> 38:34.227
Come on. Here it is. Come on.

38:34.313 --> 38:35.382
Here you go.

38:35.473 --> 38:37.225
- Watch out there, pal.
- He's OK.

38:37.313 --> 38:41.192
He's just lookin' for somethin'
to keep him busy. Here you go, boy.

38:42.353 --> 38:46.790
That's why he came here, I guess.
All the Kevaral in all these old car parts.

38:46.873 --> 38:50.912
It's mostly just the junkers
that have any in 'em. Come on.

38:53.713 --> 38:55.704
Here you go.

38:57.313 --> 38:59.304
So what is he, anyway?

39:00.273 --> 39:07.065
Well, like I already explained to the other
fellas, he's... a Tasmanian ant-eating aardvark.

39:07.153 --> 39:09.348
An "antvark", as we in the trade call him.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.264
- Trade?
- Zoo trade.

39:11.353 --> 39:15.983
I'm with the Tasmanian Zoology Foundation.
He escaped from one of our facilities.

39:16.073 --> 39:18.985
Now, wait a minute. Finders keepers.

39:19.073 --> 39:21.382
You wanna keep this thing? Like as a pet?

39:21.473 --> 39:24.465
Why not? His spit's gotta come in handy.

39:25.873 --> 39:28.182
Smells like silicone.

39:28.273 --> 39:30.503
Worth at least a buck a pound.

39:31.753 --> 39:35.109
What do you say, Chopper?
You want a little brother?

39:35.193 --> 39:37.423
What? Chopper says yes.

39:37.513 --> 39:39.981
- Good boy.
- Well, good.

39:40.073 --> 39:43.110
Looks like everything's sane
and right in your world.

39:43.193 --> 39:47.186
- Just keep him locked up at night, OK?
- No problem, no problem.

39:59.433 --> 40:01.424
How much time?

40:03.273 --> 40:05.503
Two minutes.

40:05.593 --> 40:09.029
I keep thinking about the night
we took down Manticore.

40:09.953 --> 40:12.103
When I thought I'd lost you.

40:12.753 --> 40:17.190
I came home and sat on my sofa
and I didn't get up again for days.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.949
The sun came up,

40:20.033 --> 40:22.786
the sun went down.

40:22.873 --> 40:25.262
I just sat there.

40:27.193 --> 40:29.184
It was like I couldn't move.

40:30.833 --> 40:34.667
It hurt too much to move.
And that's how I feel right now.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.784
I knew this would happen.
We shouldn't have taken the chance.

40:38.873 --> 40:40.864
We had to.

40:41.833 --> 40:43.824
You know we did.

40:46.913 --> 40:49.825
We can't keep going through this, though.

40:49.913 --> 40:51.983
I know.

40:52.073 --> 40:54.462
That year we wasted,

40:55.593 --> 41:00.462
dancing around each other,
afraid of actually admitting how we felt.

41:01.913 --> 41:07.510
If I had that time back,
I would do things so differently.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.544
Well, I guess that's it.

41:43.593 --> 41:45.470
I love you, Max.

41:52.073 --> 41:54.064
I love you, too.

42:32.593 --> 42:35.630
