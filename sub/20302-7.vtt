WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.420
NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues…

00:03.503 --> 00:05.964
I think it is the gun
that shot Hill and Renko.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.883
-Yeah.
-I want a mini-documentary.

00:08.967 --> 00:12.846
An objective journalistic analysis
of what the station house is all about.

00:12.929 --> 00:15.223
No. Really, officer, my name is Dracula.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.766
Ah!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.893
We've got a lead
on the Hill-Renko shooting,

00:18.977 --> 00:21.354
a good one, that might not wait
on the judicial process.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.648
You're on dangerous ground, Furillo.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.444
Be cool, Eddie. Turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.528
What are you doing, man?

00:28.611 --> 00:30.947
Don't tell me to sit down.
That's the guy that shot me.

00:32.782 --> 00:36.453
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

00:38.538 --> 00:41.416
All right. Item eight.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.792
(louder): Item eight!

00:45.003 --> 00:49.966
Regarding the flagrant merchandising
of photographic material…

00:50.759 --> 00:53.511
for interior locker door display.

00:54.512 --> 00:58.391
Under Article 6, Paragraph 37
of the department manual,

00:58.475 --> 01:01.728
said merchandising on police premises

01:01.811 --> 01:03.480
is strictly forbidden.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.902
Particularly those items
involving innocent animals

01:08.985 --> 01:11.071
and/or household appliances.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.948
(laughter and jeering)

01:14.032 --> 01:15.617
You gotta be really hurting.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.495
Need I say more?

01:18.578 --> 01:21.581
Finally, and of a more personal nature,

01:21.664 --> 01:23.958
for those of you who don't already know,

01:25.293 --> 01:27.921
Ferdinand DeMarco…

01:28.922 --> 01:31.091
known simply to most of us

01:31.174 --> 01:33.635
-as Freddie the Wino…
-Freddie.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.179
-is no longer with us.
-Where did he go?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.890
He was discovered this morning
when Duty Officer Jarot

01:38.973 --> 01:41.935
attempted to rouse him
with a hot cup of coffee.

01:42.018 --> 01:45.897
Perhaps some small comfort
can be taken from the fact…

01:46.773 --> 01:51.486
that he expired within the safe haven
of Holding Cell B.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.406
Now, for those of you wishing to make
a small emolument for some flowers

01:55.490 --> 01:57.867
before the boys from County Morgue arrive,

01:58.535 --> 02:01.329
please see Officer Bates or myself.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.665
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

02:05.416 --> 02:06.417
And, hey,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.754
let's be careful out there.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.385
(indistinct chatter)

02:15.468 --> 02:17.720
Life is a temporal state, my man.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.098
-Yes, indeed.
-Hey, Andrew.

02:20.181 --> 02:23.476
That's very poetic. "Temporal." Good word.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.769
Thank you, Sarge.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.315
Hey, the two of you will wanna
stick your head in the captain's office

02:29.399 --> 02:30.525
on your way out.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.154
WOMAN: I just got busted,
and they got me down at Hill Street.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.447
-MAN (on phone):<i> What?</i>
-Scooter baby, please.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.824
(conversation continues)

02:37.907 --> 02:40.034
Lucille, I gotta talk to you for a minute.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.079
And then they took me
over to Purdue Street,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.415
and you know about
them lady guards down there.

02:45.498 --> 02:49.169
Hey, peaches, I got two dollars
in my pocket got your name on it.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
Can't you wait
till she's off the phone, Renko?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.381
Or are you that hot to misdemeanor?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.425
Her? Please!

02:55.508 --> 02:57.927
I'm looking to lay this bet on you,
carrot cake.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.888
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.015
What? Two dollars
ain't good enough for you?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.643
Move it, Renko,
or I'm gonna move it for you.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.563
Hey, look. How much are the flowers
for Freddie supposed to cost?

03:08.646 --> 03:11.024
What? You want $3? I'll give you $3.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.442
-Freddie?
-Here's $3.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.485
You try to lay some "emulation"
on somebody,

03:14.569 --> 03:16.946
and they won't even treat you
like you're a human being.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.072
HOOKER: Don't say that!

03:18.948 --> 03:21.242
Scooter baby, please don't yell at me.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.786
How was I supposed to know he's a cop?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.788
MAN ON PHONE:
<i>Well, you can smell the damn--</i>

03:25.872 --> 03:28.666
Scooter, this is Officer Bates.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.960
Rena's gonna have to hang up now, and--

03:31.044 --> 03:32.962
-MAN (over phone): <i>Nice voice, baby.</i>
-What?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.590
<i>-Could you use some work?</i>
-Hey, hey, hey, watch it.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.760
Conspiracy to entreat white slavery
is a felony, my man.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.928
<i>I'm talking!</i>

03:40.011 --> 03:42.597
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:44.891
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:44.974 --> 03:48.603
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:55.652 --> 03:59.572
(theme music playing)

04:57.380 --> 05:01.301
And before you got here,
these three messages came from your ex.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.803
-Not now, Phil.
-All right.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.347
But I believe I intuited a certain rancor,

05:06.431 --> 05:09.559
which may or may not be true, as it were.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.689
Excuse me, Sarge.
You wanted to see us, Captain?

05:16.524 --> 05:18.985
FURILLO: Yeah. I have copies
of your depositions here.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.195
Give them a glance.
See if everything's all right.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.865
-Let me know if not.
-How's it coming along?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.951
Eddie Hoban's been formally charged
with your assault.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.997
He's being held at County
in lieu of $50,000 bail.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.249
LaRue and Washington
are trying to get a line

05:33.333 --> 05:34.375
on his ex-girlfriend.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.211
Day after tomorrow,
Eddie submits to a polygraph.

05:37.295 --> 05:41.215
In short, gentlemen,
the investigation is proceeding apace.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
Thanks, Captain.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.266
(phone ringing)

05:58.107 --> 06:00.526
-MAN: Gun! got a gun!
-(all shouting)

06:00.610 --> 06:02.987
-MAN 1: Get out of the way!
-MAN 2: Freeze!

06:03.071 --> 06:07.075
-MAN 2: Freeze! I mean it!
-MAN 1: Drop it. I said drop it.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.162
MAN: Watch out, Captain! She's armed!

06:11.245 --> 06:13.373
(suspense music playing)

06:13.456 --> 06:15.625
(indistinct police radio chatter)

06:20.671 --> 06:22.215
Do you wanna give me that thing?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.805
-MAN (sighs): It's the captain's ex-wife.
-(chattering)

06:33.768 --> 06:36.062
I don't believe what I just saw in there.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.855
What in the hell has gotten into you?

06:37.939 --> 06:41.692
I know most of those men.
They were gonna shoot me.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.695
Well, what do you expect
when you come in here waving a gun

06:44.779 --> 06:47.323
that looks more like it could
wipe out half a precinct

06:47.407 --> 06:48.324
than a real one?

06:48.408 --> 06:51.244
Well, if you would return my calls
once in a while,

06:51.327 --> 06:52.870
maybe this wouldn't happen.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.289
What is this?

06:55.373 --> 06:57.708
-Don't pay any attention to that.
-(gasps)

06:59.544 --> 07:02.130
What do you mean,
don't pay attention to that?

07:02.213 --> 07:05.758
There is a dead person in that bag, Frank!

07:05.842 --> 07:08.428
Fay, please, I'm pressed.
Could you get to the point?

07:08.511 --> 07:09.637
(sighs)

07:12.557 --> 07:14.934
We had an agreement. Remember?

07:15.017 --> 07:18.521
No guns or war toys
of any kind for Frank Jr.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.148
I didn't give him the gun.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.276
Now, how do you expect me
to be a responsible parent

07:23.359 --> 07:25.862
when you do everything you can
to undermine me?

07:25.945 --> 07:28.739
-No one's trying to undermine you.
-Oh, no?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.701
A little dig here, a little dig there.

07:31.784 --> 07:35.413
Children are very sensitive, Frank.
They know what's going on.

07:35.496 --> 07:40.793
Read my lips. I did not give him the gun.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.463
Well, neither did I.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.339
Fay, listen to me.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.301
If you want to come in here
and scream bloody murder

07:48.384 --> 07:49.594
every time the sink backs up,

07:49.677 --> 07:52.138
you're gonna have to take a number,
like everybody else.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.765
I told you I did not give him the gun,

07:54.849 --> 07:58.436
and I do not spend time with Frank Jr.
taking potshots at his mother.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.063
If you don't wanna believe that,
that's your problem.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.983
Well, somebody gave it to him!

08:04.442 --> 08:07.570
Fay, kids his age swap toys all the time.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.613
Who knows?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.490
Maybe Harvey gave it to him.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.074
Harvey hates guns.

08:13.075 --> 08:17.872
Besides, Harvey hasn't
been around in a while.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.124
Oh.

08:20.791 --> 08:24.420
(distant siren wailing)

08:24.504 --> 08:29.217
All right. So maybe I did jump
to one conclusion too many.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.470
Uh… It happens in the best of divorces.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.765
Do you wanna go out and have lunch later?

08:35.848 --> 08:38.726
Maybe we could settle all this quietly.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.438
I'd like that, Fay,
but I already have a lunch date.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.523
Oh.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.400
-I see.
-I'd change it if I could.

08:46.484 --> 08:50.738
Hey, you don't have to explain
to me, Frank.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.406
Not anymore.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.162
(groans)

08:59.413 --> 09:01.290
I don't know about this place, Frank.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.668
I really don't know.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.421
(door closes)

09:10.258 --> 09:11.968
(phone ringing)

09:12.051 --> 09:13.636
Oh, feeling better, Fay?

09:15.513 --> 09:18.558
Phil, would you have the deceased
taken out of there

09:18.641 --> 09:20.643
and remanded to the property room, please.

09:20.726 --> 09:21.936
Oh, certainly, Francis.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.940
Belker.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.486
-Mrs. Furillo.
-Oh, hi, Mick.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.655
Nice to see you again. How have you been?

09:32.738 --> 09:35.449
Oh, just fine. Yourself?

09:35.533 --> 09:39.495
Wonderful.
I'm dating a quality woman, Mrs. Furillo.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.872
Oh, that's wonderful, Mick.
I'm glad to hear that.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.251
Um, maybe you'd like to bring her by
for dinner some night?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.336
I-I'm sure Frank Jr.
would love to see you.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.672
-I would be honored.
-Good.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.134
Well, you take good care now, you hear?

09:53.217 --> 09:55.803
I will. Thanks, Mick. Bye.

09:55.886 --> 09:59.056
Bye. Right this way, kidney bag.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.976
I don't know, man.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.103
What's not to know?

10:04.186 --> 10:06.689
Well, coming into a dark hallway
outta the sunlight

10:06.772 --> 10:09.442
with a half a second to react
to some guy pulling a hammer on you.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.527
It's a little late
to be having second thoughts.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.987
Cowboy, you're asking me to deny

10:13.070 --> 10:15.156
that I got a problem with this,
and I can't do that.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.451
Well, I don't have a problem with it.
I saw the dude. It says so right there.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.037
And if I saw him, he was there,
and if he was there, you saw him.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.830
-Ipso facto.
-Over there.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.206
(shouting)

10:24.290 --> 10:26.500
(siren wailing)

10:26.584 --> 10:29.920
(shouting continues)

10:34.383 --> 10:36.427
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Hold on now.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.638
I bought this truck
three days ago, and look at it!

10:38.721 --> 10:40.014
I won't fix nothing, mister!

10:40.097 --> 10:43.267
I want that sucker arrested
for trespassing and attempted assault.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.811
We can't do that, sir.
You see, according to Statute L-66--

10:45.895 --> 10:47.730
Belker v. Furillo, 1964--

10:47.813 --> 10:50.191
Ninth Court of Appeals
clearly states we can't do that.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.192
Say what?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.861
Why don't you come down here for a second,
and I'll explain it.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.530
Calm down now.
Come over here and talk about this truck.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.283
Don't make problems for us.
We just get here-- Come on.

10:59.367 --> 11:03.412
Belker v. Furillo
says that if the purchasee

11:03.496 --> 11:07.375
rescinds the object in question
due to danger or distress

11:07.458 --> 11:10.002
within a quarter
of the original consignment,

11:10.086 --> 11:12.171
then he's entitled
to unobstructed easement.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.757
-Hey, man.
-Now, you're a businessman,

11:14.840 --> 11:16.967
and you should know that, man.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.304
Being the respondent to the second part
means you might have to accede

11:20.388 --> 11:23.474
to some of the fiduciary
encumbrances involved here.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.059
Now, you own a garage.

11:25.142 --> 11:28.437
Why don't you just fix the man's truck
and be done with it?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.106
It could earn you a lot of goodwill.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.776
Good what? Man, listen,
I could care less about his goodwill!

11:33.859 --> 11:36.278
(laughs)

11:36.362 --> 11:39.156
I'm not talking
about his goodwill, brother.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.742
I'm talking about my own.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.121
So why don't you just,
uh, think about that, okay?

11:45.204 --> 11:48.374
-So what's wrong with this truck?
-It needs a radiator.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.835
Now, that could be
a fiduciary encumbrance right there.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.545
How much do you need to pay for one?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.173
-Oh, 80 or 90 dollars.
-I'll work it out.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.677
-Don't worry about a thing.
-What you got?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.680
Well, I think he'll fix it,
but he's not gonna eat the whole thing.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.265
Your man gonna spring for the labor?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.267
-Yeah.
-Good.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.020
Okay, okay, listen up.
This court's made a decision.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.941
You're replacing the defective parts.
He's gonna spring for the labor.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.610
WOMAN: <i>Twelfth and Van Buren.</i>
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

12:16.694 --> 12:18.738
-All right?
-We got a 601. Let's get outta here.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.991
(upbeat music playing)

12:24.994 --> 12:26.996
(tires screeching)

12:30.124 --> 12:32.960
(siren wailing)

12:36.547 --> 12:38.507
(alarm blaring)

12:38.591 --> 12:41.886
(siren continues wailing)

12:43.429 --> 12:44.972
Renko! Watch out!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.184
(horn honking)

12:48.267 --> 12:50.060
(loud crash)

12:53.606 --> 12:56.609
MAN: Keep that traffic moving.
Keep that traffic moving.

12:56.692 --> 13:00.946
-(chattering)
-MAN: Stand back, everybody.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.158
MAN: You're not helping the situation
by being in the way.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.119
-Please leave the area.
-FURILLO: Talk to me.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.080
Okay. As far as we know,
the butcher and his apprentice

13:10.164 --> 13:12.625
are being held hostage
in a meat locker by a couple of kids.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.668
-Injuries?
-Uh, well, I don't know.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.670
-Later, please.
-One of the suspects is--

13:16.754 --> 13:18.547
-Hey, come on. Come on.
-Excuse me, sir.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.925
-One of the suspects is Hector Ruiz.
-Hector?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.928
Yeah, we just got word he escaped
from the Youth Authority.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.054
What is that?

13:25.137 --> 13:27.389
RENKO: That's just your basic
evasive action.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.350
See, this kid took a shot at us.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.393
We have an A.P.B. out on him.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.312
How do I talk to Hector?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.482
There's a phone in the freezer,
but it hasn't worked in years.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.443
-Who are you?
-Irv Kresky, Market Manager.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.445
How do you do? Stay close. I may need you.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.406
MAN: Will you move that car!

13:44.490 --> 13:45.783
Anybody talk to his mother?

13:45.866 --> 13:48.244
Lucy Bates is trying to find her, I think.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.122
-Marv, how's it coming?
-I got one last connection to make.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.124
-Okay. There.
-(radio signal tuning)

13:55.334 --> 13:58.212
This receiver's hooked up
to the one in the meat locker.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.757
The whole connection
ties into the storewide P.A. system,

14:01.841 --> 14:05.052
and this here's your kill button
in case you want to talk privately.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.888
Let's keep it on the P.A. system for now.
How do I get through?

14:07.972 --> 14:11.016
You just push this button,
and it'll ring in the meat locker.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.977
-You're a wizard, Marv.
-Yep.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.521
Anybody got any antacids?

14:15.604 --> 14:18.983
-Try halfway down the aisle to the left.
-Marv, you okay?

14:19.775 --> 14:22.278
I'm telling you the truth, Henry.
I am a mess.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.698
MAN (at a distance):
We have a car coming through here.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.450
We have a car coming through.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.206
(ringing)

14:34.290 --> 14:35.416
Yeah, what is it?

14:36.792 --> 14:41.630
Hector, it's me, Frank Furillo.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.801
Furillo, man, where've you been, huh?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.220
<i>I got here as quickly as I could.</i>

14:48.304 --> 14:52.182
<i>Let's get this thing over with fast</i>
<i>before things get too out of hand, okay?</i>

14:52.266 --> 14:53.183
<i>What do you want?</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:57.187
<i>I want $100,000 and a plane to Cuba.</i>

14:57.271 --> 14:59.648
<i>I can't stay here no more, Frank.</i>
<i>I can't, man.</i>

14:59.732 --> 15:01.233
Hector, that's no answer.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.444
Yeah, well, neither is juvenile hall, man.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.279
That place is nowhere.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.157
They'll be busting my chops
all the time for nothing, man.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.409
They're the ones that got me
kicked out of school.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.619
I'm not lying to you.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.329
Did you give it a chance?

15:13.412 --> 15:14.413
(scoffs)

15:14.496 --> 15:16.165
About as much as they gave me, man.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.459
<i>Look, they locked me in a room</i>
<i>for one week</i>

15:18.542 --> 15:20.711
<i>just 'cause I copped one lousy cigarette.</i>

15:20.794 --> 15:24.715
<i>Can you believe that, man?</i>
<i>They had all their chances, Frank.</i>

15:24.798 --> 15:28.385
-All right. Just take it easy, will you?
-(siren wailing)

15:28.469 --> 15:32.139
Um, anybody hurt or wounded in there?

15:33.098 --> 15:35.601
Not yet, man,
but we got some words to say,

15:35.684 --> 15:38.812
like turning this icebox off
before I freeze my tail, man.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.814
-Okay. I'll tell--
-Captain! Captain!

15:41.482 --> 15:44.693
Uh, just one second, okay, Hector?

15:46.779 --> 15:51.158
Captain, there's almost $20,000 worth
of choice beef in there.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.745
To hell with that! I'm concerned
about those people in there!

15:54.828 --> 15:58.666
So am I. But we work
on a one-percent markup here.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.751
And between the shopliftings
and the muggings,

16:00.834 --> 16:03.796
this particular Chucky's
is considered marginal at best.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.131
HECTOR (on speaker):
<i>Frankie, you there? You hear me?</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:08.342
Just one more second, okay, Hector?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.346
Maybe we could send in some coats.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.099
Food too, Frank. Food is very primal.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.393
If we can get them
to accept nourishment from us,

16:17.476 --> 16:19.603
it'll be a real step
in establishing rapport.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.938
Oh, good. Go ahead.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.399
-Where's the deli section?
-This way.

16:24.483 --> 16:29.363
Hector, we're having a little trouble
turning off the freezer unit,

16:29.446 --> 16:32.700
but we're gonna send in
some hot food and clothes, all right?

16:33.200 --> 16:36.161
<i>Yeah, don't jerk me around, Frank,</i>
<i>or I'll blow these suckers away now.</i>

16:36.245 --> 16:37.079
<i>You dig?</i>

16:37.162 --> 16:40.916
<i>No one's jerking you around, Hector.</i>
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:45.254
HECTOR:<i> All right. You send</i>
<i>some clothes and some food,</i>

16:45.337 --> 16:47.131
and then maybe we rap, all right, Frank?

16:52.928 --> 16:55.139
Hazlick, it looks like
we'll be able to use

16:55.222 --> 16:57.474
an elevation of about 0.7.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.435
Let's see here.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.689
I think we should put it
down here by the canned fruit.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.734
Uh, no, no. Wait a--
Hold it with that thing.

17:06.817 --> 17:10.904
Well, well, well. Frank, it's déjà vu.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.740
So much for rehabilitation, huh?

17:12.823 --> 17:14.575
What the hell is that, Howard?

17:14.658 --> 17:17.661
That is a Soyet 109
incendiary rocket launcher.

17:17.745 --> 17:18.996
It's Russian-made.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.623
And all the riot gear
is on loan from the Stockholm Police.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.459
-What do you think, Frank?
-Lose it.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.629
Judas Priest, Frank.
That's an eight-inch steel door.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.798
If those deviates
don't think we mean business,

17:29.882 --> 17:32.176
then our ace in the hole
isn't worth a brown Q-Tip.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.303
What ace in the hole?

17:34.386 --> 17:36.847
The plastique charges on the outer walls.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.143
Howard, there are innocent
people in that meat locker,

17:41.226 --> 17:43.062
so take a command.

17:43.145 --> 17:47.691
No Soyets, no plastique.
Just secure the scene. Period.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.612
The only secure scene
is a neutralized scene, Frank.

17:51.695 --> 17:55.365
Of course, if that makes your palms damp,
there is another way to go.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.534
And what might that be?

17:57.618 --> 17:58.744
Hypothermia.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.580
It's a well-known medical fact,
Latin types can't take the cold.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.709
Saunders, you take the high ground.
Lukens, you take the right flank.

18:08.378 --> 18:11.548
What we'll do is bypass
the main circuit regulator

18:11.632 --> 18:14.718
and hook up an auxiliary compressor
to that freezer unit

18:14.802 --> 18:18.388
and drop the ambient temperature in there
to ten degrees below zero.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.974
Their body temperatures drop,
they become disoriented,

18:21.058 --> 18:23.143
then drowsiness sets in,
then sleep, then--

18:23.227 --> 18:26.480
Then a slow, painless death.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.482
Is that right, Howard?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.360
Well, if that's what you want, Frank.

18:32.152 --> 18:35.531
My strategy was to waltz in there
before that point and carry them out.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.200
Actually, it's quite humane
and conservative,

18:38.283 --> 18:42.079
as this hypothermic timetable
clearly shows.

18:42.162 --> 18:46.041
(speaking Spanish)

18:47.501 --> 18:49.128
Hey, Furillo, are you out there, man?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.587
It's your show, guy,

18:50.671 --> 18:53.882
but I'd hate to try and explain
two shotgunned hostages

18:53.966 --> 18:56.426
to a board of inquiry,
much less their families.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.428
-Hector, I--
-What do you say, Frank?

18:58.512 --> 19:01.265
I can't take them down
any cleaner than that.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.558
Who said that? Huh?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.601
Ain't nobody gonna take us down. Nobody!

19:04.685 --> 19:08.021
-Hector… Hector, listen.
-(scoffs)

19:09.773 --> 19:12.025
That was great, Howard. Just great.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.695
Oh, you can't coddle these types, Frank.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.155
We either take them outta here,

19:16.238 --> 19:18.907
or we all may as well start
speaking "Espanole."

19:20.367 --> 19:21.827
Okay, set it up.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.787
But I don't want you
to implement anything,

19:23.871 --> 19:26.165
under any circumstances,
without my express order.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.458
(sighs)

19:28.542 --> 19:30.169
Whatever you say, Frank.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.672
But, you know, that kid in there
ain't exactly Beaver Cleaver.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.132
If you get my drift.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.259
All right, come on, men.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.474
MARV: I don't know.
My stomach's been killing me.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.268
I got a terrible headache.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.563
I thought I had
a hot gall bladder or something,

19:49.646 --> 19:51.148
but my internist says no.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.983
Don't pooh-pooh it, Marv.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.736
Henry, I can't "poo-poo" anything.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.071
I'm serious.
Even the conservative establishment

19:58.155 --> 20:00.532
is beginning to pay attention
to homeopathic medicine,

20:00.616 --> 20:01.658
the holistic approach.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.204
No, no. I'm telling you.
I know my own body.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.916
It's either gonna be the gall bladder…

20:09.791 --> 20:11.460
or maybe some stones.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.297
Whatever it is, it's a hell of a thing.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.091
You can't even keep down
a lousy slice of turkey.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.220
You know,
I thought you Old Testament types

20:21.303 --> 20:22.930
knew how to make a decent sandwich.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.682
Renko, my mother said eat.
She never said watch.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.560
Honestly, Hector,
I think you simply misunderstood

20:28.644 --> 20:31.021
what Lt. Hunter was trying to say.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.815
Uh, look, we're gonna send in
the food and clothes now.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.485
<i>-All right?</i>
-All right, but make it quick, Furillo.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.527
Quick, all right?

20:37.611 --> 20:39.988
Frank, if you don't mind,

20:40.072 --> 20:41.782
I'd like to be the one to take it in.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.785
Sure, Henry.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.913
FURILLO: All right, listen up.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.291
I want all guns down now.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.085
That's an order!

20:53.168 --> 20:55.254
MAN: Right. Everybody, guns down!

20:55.337 --> 20:58.882
Do you hear me, Hector?
Detective Goldblume will now approach you.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.509
He is unarmed.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.265
MAN (at a distance):
We have a truck coming through.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.557
Truck coming through.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.689
(speaking Spanish)

21:22.155 --> 21:24.992
MAN (distant): We got an ambulance here.
We got an ambulance.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.712
I know you're scared, son.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.716
We all are. It's a scary situation.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.635
But if we work together on this,
nobody has to get hurt.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.640
Okay?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.319
Give them some, man.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.156
Here.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.538
Give them one.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.292
I think I made contact,
Frank. Real contact.

22:15.834 --> 22:16.960
What contact?

22:17.044 --> 22:19.296
That kid doesn't understand
a word of English.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.798
That may not really matter, Andrew.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.926
MAN: Thank you for helping out
your police force.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.721
Thank you for helping out
your police force.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.223
Can you just move back a little more?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.476
Oh, come on, Hector.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.686
A plane to Cuba's a lot of bean dip,
and you know it!

22:34.770 --> 22:36.480
Even if I could arrange it, which I doubt,

22:36.563 --> 22:39.149
they'd send you back,
and then you're dealing with the F.B.I.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.778
And I'm gonna tell you, man,
those guys don't take kindly to hijackers.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.529
Now, listen, Hector.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.407
There's someone here
who really wants to talk to you.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.868
Don't hang up now.
I want you to talk to her.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.161
Okay, Frank.

22:54.748 --> 22:58.126
Hector, you come outta there right now!

22:58.210 --> 23:00.545
<i>And don't give these people</i>
<i>no more trouble!</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:02.714
Man, why'd you gotta
bring her here for, Frank?

23:02.798 --> 23:06.301
(shouting in Spanish)

23:08.095 --> 23:10.680
Trouble! Always with you it's trouble.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.141
And now I'm gonna lose my job
because of you.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.394
I'm gonna send you back
to the Juvenile Authority!

23:15.477 --> 23:18.355
<i>No way, man. I said I wasn't</i>
<i>going back there, Frank.</i>

23:18.438 --> 23:20.857
<i>You got no right, man.</i>
<i>It's none of your damn business!</i>

23:20.941 --> 23:23.026
<i>Now, why'd you have to go tell her, huh?</i>

23:23.110 --> 23:25.237
(Hector shouting in Spanish)

23:25.320 --> 23:28.407
(shouting in Spanish)

23:29.574 --> 23:30.617
Hector, listen to me.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.036
HECTOR: <i>No, I'm never gonna listen</i>
<i>to you again, Frank.</i>

23:33.120 --> 23:35.580
You got no right, man.
It ain't none of your business.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.707
<i>Just 'cause I take some damn hostages?</i>

23:37.791 --> 23:39.960
Is that what you want so bad, Frank, huh?

23:40.043 --> 23:42.087
<i>You want a hostage so bad?</i>

23:42.671 --> 23:45.006
Well, I'm gonna give you one
right now, Frank.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.431
-No, Hector. wait. Don't. Listen to me.
-(gunshots)

23:52.514 --> 23:54.850
-Renko! Andy!
-Easy. Easy.

23:54.933 --> 23:59.312
Nobody fires! Don't shoot and don't move!

23:59.396 --> 24:01.314
I want the paramedics in here fast!

24:01.398 --> 24:05.485
Hector, I got 20 men out here with guns.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.113
I want that shooting victim
out here right now,

24:08.196 --> 24:10.782
-or they're coming in.
-MAN (shouting): Come on! Hurry up!

24:10.866 --> 24:14.202
(Calletano speaking Spanish)

24:19.332 --> 24:21.668
Yes, yes. I understand what you're saying,

24:21.751 --> 24:25.589
but we don't know anything
about the condition of the hostages.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.551
Yes, yes. All we really know

24:29.634 --> 24:33.430
is that the perpetrators
shot up a side of beef.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.767
(sirens wailing)

24:37.851 --> 24:41.188
I'm standing in front of
Chucky's Shop 'n Save on Van Buren Avenue.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.231
Only moments ago, shots were fired.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.359
Mr. Kresky, you were inside.
Can you tell us what happened?

24:46.443 --> 24:50.572
Well, we have two Puerto Rican teenagers

24:50.655 --> 24:53.366
holding our butcher
and his apprentice hostage

24:53.450 --> 24:55.076
in the, uh, meat locker.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.662
Was anyone injured
in the exchange of gunfire?

24:57.746 --> 25:01.416
Uh, well, it wasn't exactly
an exchange of gunfire.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.169
They, uh… They shot up some meat.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.422
I see. Mr. Kresky, how often would you say

25:07.506 --> 25:10.509
that Chucky's Shop 'n Save
has been robbed in the past year?

25:10.592 --> 25:13.803
There have been six robberies
and three failed attempts

25:13.887 --> 25:16.097
before today, Cynthia.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.226
Can Chucky's continue to operate
under these conditions?

25:19.309 --> 25:21.061
That's hard to say,

25:21.144 --> 25:25.273
but, uh, mindful as we are
of our community responsibility,

25:25.357 --> 25:28.610
I-I think that business as usual
is highly unlikely.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.572
In other words,
Chucky's may not reopen its doors?

25:32.656 --> 25:34.741
That is correct. Yes.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.911
The full social and economic impact

25:37.994 --> 25:40.705
of this crime in progress
is yet to be determined.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.626
As of now, however, it does look
as if an already beleaguered community

25:44.709 --> 25:46.628
is in for an even tougher go of it.

25:46.711 --> 25:50.257
This is Cynthia Chase,
Action News, Channel 6.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.635
-(horn honking)
-What's that?

25:53.718 --> 25:57.514
(chattering)

25:57.597 --> 26:01.726
HUNTER: We're using a GL700 deluxe
mobile Frost King, Frank.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.729
It has dual frost pumps
and direct power access.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.441
It sucks up thermal B.T.U.'s
faster than an elephant in heat.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.194
I wish I felt better about this.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.197
After what that little sociopath did?

26:14.281 --> 26:16.449
Trust me, Frank,
when I get through with him,

26:16.533 --> 26:20.370
you'll be able to jam a stick up his nose
and pass him off as a Fudgsicle.

26:20.453 --> 26:24.165
Gradual, Howard. No more
than ten degrees per hour, tops.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.584
I'm in no rush here.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.755
(speaking Spanish)

26:31.590 --> 26:34.467
(speaking Spanish)

26:36.511 --> 26:37.929
Yo, Furillo, are you there?

26:38.888 --> 26:40.348
Yeah, right here, Hector.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.227
Look, um, Juan here,
Juan don't feel too good, man.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.437
So, if I send him out,

26:45.520 --> 26:47.397
you swear nothing bad
gonna come down on him,

26:47.480 --> 26:51.067
like, uh, no work farm
and no juvenile hall or nothing like that?

26:51.151 --> 26:53.278
I can't promise that, Hector.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.614
But if you're willing
to send a hostage out with him,

26:55.697 --> 26:57.907
I'd have a lot more to work with
than I have now.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.119
(Hector speaking Spanish)

27:02.912 --> 27:06.833
<i>All right. But first,</i>
<i>I wanna talk to the media. You got that?</i>

27:06.916 --> 27:08.835
Uh, I think we could come
that far, Hector.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.670
It sounds fair to me.
Just hold one minute.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.088
All right.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.382
Renko, who have we got out there?

27:14.466 --> 27:17.802
-Cynthia Chase.
-All right. Send her in.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.641
Uh, Captain, what do you want me
to do with the deceased?

27:22.724 --> 27:25.352
Tag it for evidence
and get it out of here.

27:25.435 --> 27:29.606
-The whole thing?
-Would you get me Cynthia Chase?

27:29.689 --> 27:31.983
Yes, sir. Excuse me.

27:32.609 --> 27:36.655
Hector, the television people
will be here in one minute.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.869
MAN: Back. You, right there,
move out of the way, please.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.331
(all murmuring)

27:48.500 --> 27:50.669
MAN: Can you clear out of there?
Keep moving.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.921
Just keep the traffic moving, please.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.722
Step back. Let the squad car through.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.058
-Go ahead, Joe.
-Let the squad car through.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.731
-MAN: Hey, what's going on here?
-WOMAN: A shooting.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.611
MAN: Got an ambulance here.
We got an ambulance coming through.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.946
-(siren wailing)
-Move away.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.156
Move away from the front of the building.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.287
Is that gonna be cash or charge, hair bag?

28:27.122 --> 28:29.416
MAN: All right, folks,
there's nothing to see.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.084
There's nothing going on.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.921
Captain, is it true that
you're trying to freeze the activists out?

28:35.004 --> 28:38.591
Activists? Who have you been talking to?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.094
You have a Lieutenant Howard Hunter here.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.512
Forget Lt. Hunter.

28:42.595 --> 28:45.849
Look, Miss Chase, you know
there are lives at stake here.

28:45.932 --> 28:49.144
Please don't say anything
to inflame the situation.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.731
Captain, let's try
not to manage the news, shall we?

28:56.192 --> 28:58.987
<i>Hector, this is Cynthia Chase,</i>
<i>Channel 6 News.</i>

29:00.655 --> 29:02.365
I know you. How're you doing?

29:02.449 --> 29:05.785
I'm fine, Hector, but the question is,
how are the hostages?

29:06.286 --> 29:08.455
HECTOR:
<i>The hostages are great. Just great.</i>

29:09.164 --> 29:13.585
-And how are you, emotionally?
-Oh, I ain't worried.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.588
How long do you think that you
can possibly hold out in there?

29:16.671 --> 29:21.551
(chuckling): Who knows.
There's plenty of food in here.

29:21.634 --> 29:25.764
CHASE: Hector, can you tell our viewers
why you seized this market?

29:25.847 --> 29:29.184
Hey, they chased us in here, lady.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.895
Are you a member of
the Puerto Rican National Front,

29:31.978 --> 29:34.689
or is this seizure of Chucky's
a purely independent protest?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.318
Well, why not, man?

29:38.401 --> 29:40.612
All I gotta do is cut out
the piece as evidence,

29:40.695 --> 29:42.197
and they can't legally sell it.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.451
This is wounded meat, Bobby,
and a righteous sin to waste.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.411
All they'll do
is take it down to the station.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.498
It'll get all hot,
and it won't be worth fit for dog meat.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.042
Yeah, neither will we
if Furillo finds out about it either.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.293
Shh.

29:55.376 --> 29:58.129
Look, can I help it
if somebody brought this meat down

29:58.213 --> 30:00.298
and put it right at my feet?
That's fate, man.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.926
I don't mess with fate,
not at $2.29 a pound.

30:12.101 --> 30:15.814
Okay, if we're gonna do it, son,
we might as well do it right.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.153
How are we gonna get
this thing out of here, cowboy?

30:22.237 --> 30:25.114
Our unit's temporarily indisposed.
Remember?

30:26.991 --> 30:27.992
Fear not.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.915
Would you call this a protest
against economic discrimination,

30:33.998 --> 30:35.917
in the fact that
if this market does close,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.586
it will cause such a hardship
to the people of this community?

30:40.129 --> 30:42.090
Sure. Why not?

30:42.882 --> 30:46.469
This is Cynthia Chase,
Channel 6, <i>Action News.</i>

30:47.428 --> 30:48.763
Thank you, Captain.

30:50.431 --> 30:54.060
Okay, nothing else is gonna happen.
Why don't you folks just go on home?

30:54.143 --> 30:56.271
Huh? What do you say?
Everybody, let's go--

30:56.354 --> 30:57.605
Lucia, Lucia, my <i>bonita.</i>

30:57.689 --> 31:01.067
Renko, listen.
This may not be the best time,

31:01.150 --> 31:04.362
but I've been meaning
to apologize about this morning.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.614
-No. No, no, no.
-No, I was out of line.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.950
No, no, it was nothing. It was a trifle.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.579
Listen, you don't, by any chance,
have your squad car down here, do you?

31:12.662 --> 31:13.913
Yeah, sure.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.000
Could I stash some meat
in the rear of your unit?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.421
-Please?
-Sure. Why not.

31:21.504 --> 31:22.714
Thank you.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.757
Okay, Hector, I kept my part of the deal.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.050
You got your interview.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.261
What say you hold up
your end of the bargain?

31:29.262 --> 31:31.514
All right, Frank. Just--
I hear you, all right?

31:31.598 --> 31:33.766
Just be cool, man.
Just be cool, all right?

31:36.477 --> 31:40.148
Look, Furillo,
I'm gonna send the girl out first,

31:40.231 --> 31:41.983
then I'm gonna send Juan, all right?

31:43.651 --> 31:46.696
You, come here. Come on! Hurry up!

31:51.451 --> 31:54.537
-(siren wailing)
-Okay, she's all set, Lieutenant.

31:54.621 --> 31:55.955
Good work, Carew.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.712
Someone's coming out.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.008
-(girl whimpering)
-MAN: Wait!

32:08.426 --> 32:11.012
Frank, man, talk to me.
What's going down, man?

32:11.095 --> 32:14.891
Uh, Hector, don't do anything
till I figure out what happened.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.646
-Did you set up anything--
-Frank? Frank?

32:19.729 --> 32:22.482
That was just a little misdirect
on a D.C. power surge.

32:22.565 --> 32:25.735
My boys will have that
juiced up again in no time.

32:26.819 --> 32:29.530
Uh, Hector, I know you're gonna
find this hard to believe,

32:29.614 --> 32:31.324
but we had nothing to do with the lights.

32:31.407 --> 32:35.828
It was just a local brownout.
Affected the whole neighborhood.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.498
Look, Frank, it's as cold
as a witch's lip in here, man.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.249
I can't even feel my fingers or nothing.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.088
<i>Something bad is gonna happen, Frank,</i>
<i>and it's not gonna be my fault, man.</i>

32:45.171 --> 32:47.548
No? Whose then? Mine?

32:48.216 --> 32:52.303
Look, Hector, I'm not the one
who tried to hold up this supermarket,

32:52.387 --> 32:56.182
and I'm not the one who blames
everybody else in the world but himself

32:56.265 --> 32:57.767
for his own troubles.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.645
Win, lose, or draw,
don't dump this one on me.

33:00.728 --> 33:02.814
You take responsibility for a change!

33:03.398 --> 33:05.942
Captain, it's Sergeant Esterhaus
on the phone.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.360
He says it's urgent.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.572
Look, Hector,
let's just take a few minutes

33:11.656 --> 33:14.617
to think this thing over, okay? And, uh…

33:14.701 --> 33:17.120
-He'll be right with you.
-Then we'll get back on it, okay?

33:22.291 --> 33:24.293
He's coming. He's right here.

33:26.671 --> 33:27.755
Yeah, Phil?

33:27.839 --> 33:31.384
Francis, I have placed numerous calls
to the medical examiner,

33:31.467 --> 33:32.510
and as of this moment,

33:32.593 --> 33:35.722
no morgue personnel
have arrived for Freddie's body.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.932
Phil, I can't deal with this now.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.351
I've got a deteriorating situation here.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.354
We have a deteriorating
situation ourselves, Francis,

33:43.438 --> 33:46.357
with serious consequences, hygiene-wise!

33:46.441 --> 33:48.568
Calm down, Phil.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.779
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You don't have to deal with this!

33:51.863 --> 33:54.490
-Deal with what?
-It's a memorandum from Division

33:54.574 --> 33:58.995
canceling funds for
Grace's redecoration project in favor of

33:59.078 --> 34:01.706
a new Mayday phone system as well as,

34:01.789 --> 34:05.418
hold onto your hat, Francis,
a helicopter pad on the roof!

34:06.002 --> 34:08.629
Phil, I can't go into this now.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.467
Francis, what am I gonna tell Grace?
She'll be heartbroken.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.595
Look, I appreciate
the gravity of the situation,

34:15.678 --> 34:17.889
but you're just gonna
have to do the best you can

34:17.972 --> 34:19.474
until I get back there, okay?

34:19.557 --> 34:21.642
Francis, I'm not normally an alarmist,

34:21.726 --> 34:24.520
but there could be serious
emotional fallout from this.

34:24.604 --> 34:27.440
I know you're not an alarmist, Phil, but--

34:27.523 --> 34:29.984
(excited chattering)

34:34.238 --> 34:36.949
MAN: Members of the press,
please move back.

34:37.992 --> 34:41.287
-(siren wailing)
-(indistinct chatter)

34:44.207 --> 34:45.249
(siren stops)

34:48.002 --> 34:50.213
The captain won't be but a minute, babe.

34:50.296 --> 34:54.008
MAN: Thank you for cooperating.
Thank you for moving back.

34:57.553 --> 35:00.264
Frank, John LaRue's outside.
He says it's urgent.

35:01.557 --> 35:02.391
(sighs)

35:02.475 --> 35:05.394
Okay. If Hector comes back on the line,
give me a holler, will you?

35:06.562 --> 35:08.397
MAN: Stand back.

35:08.481 --> 35:11.025
MAN: Thank you for helping out
your police force.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.027
I'm sorry to pull you
out of there, Captain.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.612
Make it fast. What have you got?

35:14.695 --> 35:17.365
Eddie Hoban's ex-girlfriend,
Sherry Marie, she's in the car.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.699
Okay, take her in and hold her.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.743
I should be through in here
in a couple of hours.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.079
Captain, she's a little flaky.

35:23.162 --> 35:25.915
I think we take her in,
she's gonna maybe dummy up on us.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.584
Two minutes. What could it hurt?

35:29.585 --> 35:30.878
Give her a listen.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.424
That's it.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.718
Now, you know if we don't
time this move just right,

35:37.802 --> 35:39.637
we might as well just eat it here.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.431
Karma, my man. It's all in the karma.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.768
When was the last time
you saw Eddie Hoban?

35:46.269 --> 35:50.565
Well, the last time I saw Eddie,
he got real mad for no real reason,

35:51.440 --> 35:53.985
and he broke my nose, my jaw.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.487
I couldn't eat solids for a month.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.992
You know, he used to be so sweet
till he started selling dope,

36:01.075 --> 36:03.744
and then he got real paranoid
and started carrying a gun.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.248
Did you ever see the gun

36:07.331 --> 36:10.209
Eddie allegedly shot
the two police officers with?

36:10.293 --> 36:13.713
Sure. He carried it all the time.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.882
You think you'd recognize it
if you saw it again?

36:16.924 --> 36:17.925
Sure.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.387
Something like that?

36:22.305 --> 36:23.389
That's it!

36:24.682 --> 36:26.100
Exactly.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.144
You sure?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.522
Like I said, exactly.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.275
Are you absolutely positive?

36:35.484 --> 36:36.360
Yeah.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.072
Thanks for your trouble, Miss Libertini.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.868
Listen, I got lots more stuff
I could tell you,

36:44.619 --> 36:48.831
but next time it'll cost you
more than $20, okay?

36:51.709 --> 36:53.628
You paid for that drivel?

36:54.837 --> 36:58.049
Look, LaRue,
what we need is a reliable witness,

36:58.132 --> 37:00.426
not a junkie with one oar out of the water

37:00.509 --> 37:02.261
who can't stand her boyfriend's guts

37:02.345 --> 37:03.763
and who can't tell the difference

37:03.846 --> 37:06.933
between a snubbed-nose .38
and a .357 cannon.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.310
She got a little flustered. That's all.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.103
Let me and Neal work with her for a while.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.939
I appreciate your zeal, John,

37:13.022 --> 37:15.900
but I don't think this girl's
the answer to our prayers.

37:15.983 --> 37:19.028
MAN: Folks, can you clear out of there?
Keep moving.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.072
-Let her go?
-Let her go.

37:24.867 --> 37:27.161
(speaking Spanish)

37:27.245 --> 37:29.872
All right, all right.
Just be cool, all right? Be cool.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.544
HECTOR: <i>Hey, Furillo, are you there?</i>

37:37.296 --> 37:39.090
Right here, Hector.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.927
Look, man, there's too much coming down.

37:43.010 --> 37:44.595
Just too many people, all right?

37:45.179 --> 37:47.056
What do you say
we get them all outta here,

37:47.139 --> 37:48.766
and then maybe we talk, all right?

37:49.642 --> 37:53.271
-What do you think, Henry?
-He's cold, tired.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.274
If he's ready to give up, Frank,

37:56.357 --> 37:59.068
I think this might be
just his way of saving face.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.823
Okay, Hector.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.909
Just give me five minutes.
I'm ordering everyone out now.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.245
All right. Hurry up, man.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.290
Now, listen up, everybody!

38:13.124 --> 38:16.544
I want everyone out of here right now!

38:16.627 --> 38:18.587
-Okay. Let's go.
-Come on.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.299
Out of here, everybody.
Come on, come on, come on.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.009
WOMAN: They said everybody.

38:23.092 --> 38:26.345
MAN: We got an ambulance here.
We got an ambulance coming through.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.389
WOMAN: Come on!

38:29.098 --> 38:31.475
Hey, guys, you could've
wrapped it or something.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.102
You're gonna stink up the whole car.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.603
Don't worry, my little side cut.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.939
It'll be out of your way
once we get back to the station.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.984
HILL: That's right. With ten pounds
of choice cut as your reward.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.236
This has not been one
of the best days of our lives,

38:42.320 --> 38:43.863
professionally speaking, has it?

38:43.946 --> 38:45.698
Yeah, I'd say that was a fair assessment.

38:45.781 --> 38:49.160
But on the other hand,
things do have a way of evening out.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.578
How's that, lover?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.705
Neal, my man, you remember that barbecue

38:52.788 --> 38:55.541
we're always talking about throwing
at your cousin Jerome's?

38:55.624 --> 38:58.586
Oh, yes, I believe I do! Yes!

38:58.669 --> 39:02.089
J.D., my man, do you think
you can get inside that trunk?

39:02.173 --> 39:03.924
Yes, Neal, I believe I can.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.509
(chuckles)

39:07.678 --> 39:10.681
Okay, Hector, it's all clear now.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.434
<i>The store's empty.</i>
<i>It's just Det. Goldblume and me.</i>

39:13.517 --> 39:16.562
So what say you let
the hostages out and we'll talk?

39:16.645 --> 39:18.856
Yeah, I can see, Frankie. I got eyes.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.651
MAN (distant): Do not remain here.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.374
(speaking Spanish)

39:37.041 --> 39:38.542
Come on. You, too.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.383
-Go.
-Okay, son, let's go.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.470
(door closes)

39:51.847 --> 39:54.725
HECTOR (oh phone):
<i>Frank, maybe my mother's right, man.</i>

39:55.434 --> 39:57.353
<i>I'm no good to nobody. You know that?</i>

39:58.562 --> 39:59.939
<i>I'd be better off dead.</i>

40:00.940 --> 40:02.733
I don't believe that, Hector.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.194
Well, you think
I'm scared to die, Furillo, huh?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.196
Let me tell you, I ain't.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.658
But I'll be honest with you.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.536
If you send me back to juvenile hall,

40:14.286 --> 40:15.996
now that place scares me, man.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.833
Look, Hector, I can't promise
you won't have to go back,

40:18.916 --> 40:20.251
because you will.

40:20.334 --> 40:23.462
But I can promise you that
I'll do everything possible

40:23.546 --> 40:26.132
to get you sent to a place
outside of the system,

40:26.757 --> 40:28.717
where you'll have a better chance.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.804
Come on, Furillo.
Why don't you get serious, huh?

40:31.887 --> 40:33.431
Those places cost.

40:34.014 --> 40:39.311
Besides, who's gonna take
a 15-year-old spic with no money, huh?

40:41.397 --> 40:44.650
Promises? I've heard them all, man.

40:44.733 --> 40:47.027
(pants)

40:47.111 --> 40:49.697
Maybe you got somebody
who cares what happens to you.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.075
But who the hell cares
what happens to me, huh?

40:53.159 --> 40:58.122
Me. I care, Hector. Let me try.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.751
You mean you'd do that for me, Furillo?

41:03.335 --> 41:05.129
I can try, yes.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.340
<i>Leave your gun, Hector.</i>

41:15.973 --> 41:19.226
(sentimental music playing)

41:37.369 --> 41:38.454
Furillo, man,

41:38.537 --> 41:40.789
I know you said all that stuff
to get me out of there,

41:41.624 --> 41:44.126
but don't think that's
why I'm giving up, all right?

41:46.670 --> 41:48.088
You wanna frisk me?

41:49.673 --> 41:51.842
You're a tough piece of work, Hector.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.846
You ready?

41:58.057 --> 41:59.183
Yeah.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.355
We can't just leave it in the trunk, J.D.

42:04.438 --> 42:05.856
The heat will kill it, babe.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.067
So, we'll hide it downstairs
in one of the old cages

42:08.150 --> 42:09.944
until the shift ends.

42:10.027 --> 42:14.323
Now, how are we gonna camouflage
180 pounds of corn-fed beef down there?

42:14.406 --> 42:17.117
I've got an old body bag in the trunk.
Nobody'll touch it.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.911
Yeah. (laughs)

42:20.454 --> 42:24.208
LARUE: Good times, good folks,
good food. Saturday night.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.752
Yeah, bring her. Plenty for everybody.

42:26.835 --> 42:29.630
WASHINGTON: Yeah, baby.
A barbecue to end all barbecues.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.299
Mm-hmm. You oughta see the meat we scored.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.219
Mm-hmm. It's gonna be
a real big blowout, baby.

42:35.302 --> 42:38.305
So, come early and come hungry. Yeah.

42:38.889 --> 42:43.519
Hey, Sergeant, you keep the receipt,
and we keep the release.

42:43.602 --> 42:46.564
The men and women of this precinct
would consider it a favor

42:46.647 --> 42:52.069
if, uh, this token of our appreciation

42:52.152 --> 42:55.698
accompanied Mr. DeMarco
to his final destination.

42:55.781 --> 42:57.866
Sure. What the hell? Why not?

42:58.492 --> 42:59.493
Thank you.

43:00.202 --> 43:02.288
(phone ringing)

43:09.461 --> 43:11.046
Come on. Come on!

43:14.550 --> 43:16.760
Take a seat, spittoon face.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.431
Hey, somebody wanna call me a vet?
I think I need a rabies shot here.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.391
Don't test my goodwill, cue ball.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.939
-Name.
-Fitzgerald, F. Scott.

43:30.065 --> 43:31.817
(laughs): What's the "F" stand for?

43:31.900 --> 43:34.903
-Felix.
-(phone rings)

43:34.987 --> 43:36.113
Belker.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.616
-WOMAN (over phone): <i>Hi, it's Debbie.</i>
-Hi, Debbie.

43:40.075 --> 43:42.328
Um, I'm off at eight o'clock.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.330
What time is your cello practice over?

43:44.413 --> 43:45.289
<i>About 8:00.</i>

43:45.372 --> 43:47.958
So, how about if I pick you up?
Maybe we'll go to a flick.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.251
<i>That'd be great.</i>

43:49.335 --> 43:50.252
Where?

43:50.336 --> 43:51.837
(Debbie speaking indistinctly)

43:51.920 --> 43:54.506
-They show porno movies at that place.
-(laughs)

43:55.341 --> 43:59.261
How would you like to spend
six weeks in traction?

44:00.679 --> 44:04.475
Frank, I've got a dozen calls
from Van Buren area merchants.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.851
They're in an uproar.

44:05.934 --> 44:08.729
They heard on TV
that Chucky's may shut down for good.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.272
Cynthia Chase.

44:10.356 --> 44:13.734
Remind me first thing in the morning
to get Division P.R. on that.

44:13.817 --> 44:17.279
-Did you set up a meeting with them?
-Yes, tomorrow evening, eight o'clock.

44:19.323 --> 44:22.034
My tally says we got 40 people
for the barbecue, babe.

44:22.117 --> 44:24.411
Mm-hmm. Let me see. Check.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.373
Well, let's go load up the car
and steal away into the night.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.542
Additionally, Francis,

44:30.626 --> 44:32.628
I think we oughta pay
a little more attention

44:32.711 --> 44:35.297
to this burgeoning black van situation.

44:35.923 --> 44:36.799
Again?

44:36.882 --> 44:40.928
We had a male Caucasian robbed,
stripped and severely beaten.

44:41.011 --> 44:45.015
We had to send him to Emergency
with a nasty cut on the left buttock.

44:45.099 --> 44:48.310
CALLETANO: It's serious, Frank.
Someone is going to get killed.

44:48.394 --> 44:51.855
I cut Santini and Harris loose
from regular patrol and put them on it.

44:53.482 --> 44:56.860
Ray, uh, no offense intended,

44:56.944 --> 45:00.906
but would you mind if, uh,
I had a moment with the captain

45:00.989 --> 45:02.700
a cappella, as it were?

45:02.783 --> 45:05.035
-No problem, Phil.
-Thanks.

45:06.286 --> 45:07.955
Now, Francis, uh…

45:09.289 --> 45:11.625
I spoke to Grace, and, uh…

45:12.876 --> 45:14.712
she's terribly distraught.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.424
I think she'll be all right, Phil.
She's a strong woman.

45:18.507 --> 45:22.970
Indeed. Look, I admit a Mayday
phone system could be of value,

45:23.053 --> 45:25.472
but a helicopter pad on the roof?

45:26.223 --> 45:28.600
Counselor, good of you to come.

45:31.311 --> 45:32.646
Are we done, Phil?

45:32.730 --> 45:35.274
Not to belabor the point,
but I can't help thinking

45:35.357 --> 45:38.902
that a call from you to Commander Swanson
might be in order.

45:39.611 --> 45:43.657
I can't help feeling we're being fitted
for a brown helmet on this one, Francis.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.162
-Hello, Miss Davenport.
-Sergeant.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.374
-Damn it.
-Huh?

45:52.458 --> 45:54.042
Something doesn't seem right.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.086
-What's that?
-I don't know, Neal.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.756
-What?
-It feels a whole lot lighter than before.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.383
Hey, nothing to worry about, babe.
Your basic shrinkage.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.427
That's all. Perfectly natural.

46:03.510 --> 46:06.555
I gotta tell you, Joyce.
The cop in me really wanted to nail him

46:06.638 --> 46:08.515
for endangering those people like that.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.060
But there's something
special about Hector.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.773
Besides, I promised him
I'd deliver on this one.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.316
I gave him my word.

46:18.358 --> 46:19.902
So, what are you? Solomon?

46:21.111 --> 46:22.863
You were coerced, Frank.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.243
(sighs): Okay.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.789
If you like, I can call my ex-husband.

46:32.790 --> 46:36.126
He used to be legal counsel
for the Stony Brook School in Arizona.

46:36.752 --> 46:39.087
-Stony Brook?
-They're the best.

46:39.171 --> 46:42.466
Tough academics, lots of physical labor,

46:42.549 --> 46:46.261
group and private therapy, and,
most important of all, lots of love.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.722
To hell with Hector. Send me.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.892
-(laughing)
-I appreciate it, Joyce.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.062
It's good of you.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.357
For you, kid, anything.

46:59.858 --> 47:02.486
-Home later?
-I can't.

47:03.070 --> 47:05.864
I've got an E.R.A. fund-raiser
with Skip Fitzgerald.

47:07.032 --> 47:09.117
Maybe early breakfast tomorrow.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.744
Like, say, in bed.

47:12.454 --> 47:15.207
I'll arrange my schedule
accordingly, Counselor.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.292
Get a good night's sleep.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.671
You're gonna need it, pizza man.

47:20.754 --> 47:23.632
(phone ringing)

47:35.269 --> 47:37.646
I want to apologize for this morning.

47:37.729 --> 47:38.981
Oh, forget it.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.400
Listen, where is Frank Jr.?

47:41.483 --> 47:44.486
I phoned the house a little while ago,
and nobody answered.

47:44.570 --> 47:47.447
He's got a sleepover
at Marilyn Fiebelkorn's house tonight.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.992
A sleepover? With a girl?

47:50.534 --> 47:52.035
He's eight years old, Dad.

47:52.119 --> 47:55.122
He's got his own sleeping bag.
What could happen?

47:55.205 --> 47:57.624
You ever hear of a game called doctor?

47:58.625 --> 48:01.545
Well, I'd rather we had a doctor
in the family than a cop.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.634
Anyway, uh… (sighs)

48:07.718 --> 48:10.762
I'm all alone tonight, and I wondered
if you'd want to come by for dinner.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.640
I don't think so, Fay.
I just want to go home,

48:13.724 --> 48:17.019
take a shower and press the sheets.

48:17.102 --> 48:18.103
(sighs)

48:18.186 --> 48:19.479
Sleeping alone these days?

48:21.440 --> 48:23.025
She's very pretty, Frank.

48:23.108 --> 48:24.234
Who?

48:27.112 --> 48:29.615
Who… the watercooler, that's who.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.201
Good night, Frank.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.831
ESTERHAUS:
Well, I love you, too, mouselet.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.542
Oh… (kissing)

48:40.626 --> 48:43.754
Mouse kisses back. (laughs)

48:45.881 --> 48:47.215
Take care now, Fay.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.009
I'll do my best, Phil. Thanks.

48:52.554 --> 48:53.722
Mouse kisses.

49:07.444 --> 49:10.030
