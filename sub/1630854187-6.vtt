WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:11.400
[phone ringing, vibrating]

00:12.880 --> 00:18.360
[phone ringing, vibrating]

00:20.040 --> 00:25.640
[phone ringing, vibrating]

00:27.920 --> 00:31.480
[Marcus narrating] Yeah, looking back now,
for as long as I can remember, like,

00:31.560 --> 00:33.680
I don't think I ever
really truly loved myself.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.640
Not really anyway, like,
not the way you're supposed to.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.080
I was never taught how.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.400
Instead, I learnt to love the money
and all the shiny things it brought.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.120
The cars, the watches, the jewellery,
the fancy clothes.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.360
All of the things that made me feel
like I was someone special.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.840
You know, that made me look like
I was actually worth something,

00:55.920 --> 01:00.080
when in reality, the truth was underneath
all of the fancy shit...

01:01.240 --> 01:04.120
I felt worthless, man,
like I was insecure.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.440
And the money, well...

01:07.280 --> 01:09.360
Well, the money just helped
cover it all up.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.400
[door opens]

01:12.200 --> 01:15.520
But like everything else in this world,
nothing lasts forever.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.480
And when that money goes, well...

01:18.920 --> 01:21.920
Well, see, there's something about
when a man is stripped bare.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.200
Naked of everything, all his possessions,
all his shiny things.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.640
His money and wealth included.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.680
When that happens,
there's something that forces that man

01:31.760 --> 01:33.960
to take a good look at himself.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.920
And, like, see what really defines him,

01:36.000 --> 01:37.320
see what makes him tick.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.960
And see, often, when that happens,
when that situation occurs,

01:42.040 --> 01:44.880
and we're forced to take
a good look in that mirror,

01:44.960 --> 01:48.120
we end up not liking the person
we see staring straight back at us.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.960
Sometimes, in fact,
we actually end up hating them

01:52.040 --> 01:54.440
and by them, I mean hating ourselves.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.640
So that's how it goes.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.280
The guy stopped opposite you
at the traffic lights, like,

02:01.360 --> 02:04.120
that person you walk past
on your way to the corner store.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.360
We dislike them, these total strangers,

02:07.440 --> 02:10.440
for no other reason than we recognise
a part of ourselves in them.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.600
They're a reflection
of our own hate towards ourselves.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.880
So there lies the problem.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.040
As corny as it might sound,

02:20.120 --> 02:23.240
we'll only really learn to love ourselves,
our real selves,

02:24.280 --> 02:26.600
when we finally learn
to stop hating each other

02:27.600 --> 02:28.800
and that's the truth.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.400
[motorbike engine roars]

02:30.440 --> 02:32.600
[indistinct chatter]

02:32.680 --> 02:35.440
The hate we have for each other
stops us from loving ourselves, like,

02:35.520 --> 02:37.760
stops us from growing
as a people, from uniting.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.120
I'm the reason you make money.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.720
It sounds strange, but...

02:43.800 --> 02:46.080
Because, like, think
of a house of cards, right?

02:47.320 --> 02:50.240
Like, by themselves each card
is just like a regular card,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.800
but when you put each card together,
like, you start to build something,

02:54.880 --> 02:57.080
something bigger, better even.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.800
We need to be like that, man.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.360
Like a house of cards,
every one of us working together.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.000
Supporting each other,
little by little, piece by piece.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.320
I mean, love, like, love is a strong word,

03:08.400 --> 03:11.000
we don't have to love each other
straight away, that'll come in time

03:11.080 --> 03:13.240
but the hate has to stop, man.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.520
It has to stop now.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.280
Cos it's killing us, man,
more and more each day.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.680
So, yeah.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.720
Yeah, we need to be like a house of cards.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.920
Fucking house of cards, man.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.520
Cos if one falls, then they all fall.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.000
We all fall down.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.040
Oi, you little dickhead,
what you doing out here?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.240
Why you not at school?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.440
We just came back from lunch.
I was gonna get my bike.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.360
What you mean "we"? You think
it's some kind of game or suttin'?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.880
These man don't even go to fucking school.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.000
Do you wanna be like these man, yeah?
Wastemen.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.000
Listen, get your bike and get
your skinny arse back to school.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.800
Don't let me ever
catch you out here again, yeah?

04:03.880 --> 04:05.440
Cos I'll embarrass you.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.960
[kisses teeth]

04:07.040 --> 04:08.400
Fool.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.120
[kisses teeth]
Ay, your brother's a wasteman.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.200
[dog barking]

04:19.000 --> 04:20.960
[machinery whirring]

04:46.360 --> 04:48.360
[indistinct chatter on loudspeaker]

04:56.600 --> 04:58.520
Marcus.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.560
Wagwan.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.760
Been hiding under any cars lately?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.640
[laughter]

05:04.720 --> 05:07.920
Allow it, man. You left me.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.920
What you talking about?
Man didn't leave you.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.760
Man had to circle the block twice,
come back and you was gone, fam.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.760
I used it.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.040
What?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.360
What do you mean you used it, blud?

05:21.920 --> 05:24.160
Used it on who and where?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.800
-When you left me.
-What you talking about?

05:27.480 --> 05:29.320
Yesterday, I got spotted.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.560
They ducked man down again.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.320
You man left me out there by myself.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.440
I was out there in the trenches
on my own, bro.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.720
How could you do that to me?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.680
You didn't call me, bro.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.480
You didn't call me,
you didn't circle back.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.680
Almost lost my life, bro. Again!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.720
What do you mean "again"?
Furthermore, wait.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.560
So, who did you hit?

05:53.560 --> 05:58.200
You bust my dawg, you use my khan,
like khan's cheap.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.880
Who did you hit, fam?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.440
I was on my one's, bro, lacking, bro,
you weren't there.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.920
Who did you hit, blud?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.520
-I had to do suttin', man.
-Who did you hit?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.400
[gang member] Brudda,
did you not hear what he said?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.800
He said, "Who did you hit?"

06:12.880 --> 06:14.600
They was ducking me, bro, what'd you mean?

06:15.360 --> 06:17.320
I had to let it off in the sky.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.560
[laughter]

06:21.480 --> 06:22.840
[gang member] Man is a jokeman!

06:22.920 --> 06:25.440
Hold on, hold on, wait.
So you come in here, yeah,

06:25.520 --> 06:29.280
all pumped up, breathing heavy,
gassed and that,

06:29.360 --> 06:31.360
acting like you done the mad ting.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.520
When really you let it off
in the sky, fam?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.760
[laughter]

06:36.840 --> 06:38.840
You probably hit a bird or suttin', blud.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.720
You weren't there, bro.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.000
You didn't even call me, bro,
all you had to do was call me.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.400
Oi, you think man give a shit about
what you're talking about, blud? Huh?

06:51.400 --> 06:53.160
You think man care
about all this bullshit.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.280
You coming in here crying
like some little baby.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.360
What, have me and you got a problem, fam?

06:59.640 --> 07:00.920
Have we?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.880
Yo, cos if we do, ya know,

07:04.960 --> 07:07.360
you can't come back round here,
you understand?

07:08.640 --> 07:09.800
You hear me?

07:10.760 --> 07:14.880
Not you, your crackhead mum, none of that.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.680
This is my ends, I run round here,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.840
Can get you got at any time, bro.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.240
All I got to do is say the word.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.160
You know what? Furthermore, yeah,

07:27.240 --> 07:29.960
I might even make your little brother
do it for me, fam.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.000
[gang member] That's a good idea.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.440
Leave my little brother out of it, man.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.960
Man, shut up, man.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.640
Your little brother's working
with the gang now, you feel me.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.440
Leave him, man. He's only a little kid.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.320
Blud, he ain't no kid,
he's on more than you.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.760
Feel me?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.920
He's got nuttin' to do with it, man.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.480
It's between me and you.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.920
Blud, are you stupid?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.920
I've just told you, your little brother's
part of the team now.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.200
He's gang, innit.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.960
Do you know what?

08:01.040 --> 08:03.360
Furthermore, I'm out.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.200
You're damn right you're out, bro.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.680
You're fired. [laughs]

08:10.280 --> 08:11.920
Cos I said so.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.240
Little pussy, blud.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.320
Dickhead.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.680
[gang member]
Fam, you niggas get no chicks anyway.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.120
How about that for
a fucking conversation, blud?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.840
Ay, shut up, bro. This guy's
always talking 'bout gettin' tings.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.320
What tings do you even get?

08:26.400 --> 08:28.200
What? You ain't see me with
that muddled bitch from last week?

08:28.280 --> 08:31.320
[sighs] Bro, I can't even lie to you,
she was not feeling your ting.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.680
You know, fuck you anyway.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.760
If bitches was to come through
here anyway, I know we can't get shit

08:35.800 --> 08:38.000
cos you is looking dusty as fuck

08:38.080 --> 08:39.880
Look at this little nigga's fucking bike

08:40.000 --> 08:42.480
What type of fucking '79 Caprice looking,

08:42.520 --> 08:46.520
World Cup losing arse 1986

08:46.640 --> 08:48.880

08:48.960 --> 08:50.160
Hey, you know what? Fuck that.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.880

You ever seen your parents with some shit

09:14.080 --> 09:15.280
[Danial] Nah.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.520
This is the richest man
that the world ever seen, G.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.000
Black man. African man.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.840
-Musa Mensa.
-Bro! Shut up, bro!

09:25.880 --> 09:28.880
Musa Mensa didn't sell no fucking GD
to get all that money, did he?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.880
Every nigga starts from somewhere, G.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.760
[he laughs]

09:32.880 --> 09:34.480
Yeah, man, like...

09:34.520 --> 09:36.640
Man needs to do better, man,

This time I actually want to try it, like.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.880
Ay, boss, stop the car!
Stop the car! Stop the car!

09:40.960 --> 09:42.640
And for me, it's just that GD.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.040
[tense music]

09:51.440 --> 09:52.600
Who's this nigga?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.240
I said where's he fucking gone, huh?

09:57.320 --> 09:58.720
I don't know my nigga.
We're just chilling.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.960
I said where the fuck is he,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.440

10:02.520 --> 10:05.080
-I don't know, fam, we were just chillin'.
-What'd you mean chillin'?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.320
What'd you mean chillin', bro?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.840
Are you mad? That's my little brother!

10:07.880 --> 10:09.960
I don't want to see none of you man
anywhere near him, yeah?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.640
Not on the block! Not in school! Nowhere!

10:12.720 --> 10:16.360
Make sure you man walk on

10:16.440 --> 10:19.200
Fucking dickheads, blud!
Stay the fuck away from him!

10:22.880 --> 10:23.960
Hey, yo, watch!

10:26.840 --> 10:28.520
Predator looking motherfucker!

10:28.640 --> 10:31.080
Hey, bro. How'd you let a man
grips you up like that?

10:31.160 --> 10:33.080
Oh, fam, it is what it is, you get me?

10:33.160 --> 10:35.640
Man can't be a gangster in all situations.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.720
I'll get him back.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.640
[door opens, closes]

10:48.960 --> 10:50.320
Yo, Mum.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.880
[Vivian] Marcus, baby,
is that you? You alright?

10:52.960 --> 10:54.520
Yeah, it's me. I'm good.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.360
Have you heard Dan come in yet?

10:57.440 --> 10:58.840
Yeah.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.960
No... no, I don't think so.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.480
Ah... do you know,
I actually can't remember.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.840
I've just been sleeping all day.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.560
Baby, I'm not feeling too good, you know?

11:12.600 --> 11:16.440
My head's hurting
and I'm feeling kind of weak.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.400
Erm, Marcus, baby,
do you think that you could, erm--

11:20.480 --> 11:22.400
Look. Look, Mum.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.640
I've gotta go, man.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.160
It's Danial, he...

11:27.240 --> 11:28.960
[kisses teeth] Ah, forget it.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.960
-[train rattling]
-[dog barks]

11:38.040 --> 11:40.040
[footsteps]

11:41.920 --> 11:43.960
Mum, do you love us?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.480
Like, do you actually really love us?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.160
I don't think you do.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.040
I don't think you ever did, you know?

11:52.520 --> 11:55.240
And... like, I get it.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.920
It's not even about me no more.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.400
I've gone through it. I swear.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.840
Like, I'm OK with it now, you know?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.960
I've dealt with it. You not loving me.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.080
But Danial.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.480
He loves you and he needs you.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.040
He fucking misses you,

12:13.120 --> 12:14.680
but he'll never admit it.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.120
I promise you he does.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.280
It's about time you started acting
like a fucking mum!

12:20.400 --> 12:22.040
You need to be better, man!

12:22.120 --> 12:24.480
You need to do better!
You need to be better!

12:24.560 --> 12:26.880
He's only fucking eight years old, man!

12:26.960 --> 12:28.800
-He needs his mum!
-Fuck off!

12:36.640 --> 12:39.040
It's always about you fucking guys, yeah?

12:40.320 --> 12:43.440
Huh? Do you think I'm happy like this?

12:44.840 --> 12:46.160
I'm in pain, man.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.120
Can't you understand that, like,
can't you just see it, like?

12:52.920 --> 12:56.160
I'm in... pain.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.640
Nah, you're fucking selfish.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.800
That's what you are.
And you know what I see?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.480
All I see is a fucking dead woman.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.240
You're fucking dead to me.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.560
Ah, you what, you're fucking--
fuckin' Mr High and Mighty,

13:12.640 --> 13:14.760
what you think
you're better than me, innit?

13:14.840 --> 13:16.880
No, you ain't no better than me, you know?

13:16.960 --> 13:18.360
[manic laugh]

13:19.040 --> 13:20.720
You're not better than me.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.920
You're a loser.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.800
You're a fucking loser.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.000
You ain't nothing,
you're absolutely nothing, yeah?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.680
I fucking wish you were gone, man!

13:33.600 --> 13:35.160
I fucking wish you were dead, man!

13:35.840 --> 13:38.400
Then I wouldn't have to fucking
see your fucking...

13:38.480 --> 13:40.840
-Fucking face a--!
-[door slams]

13:41.320 --> 13:43.480
[sobbing]

13:58.360 --> 13:59.840
[Marcus] So now that's off my chest,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.680
I guess I just want to say thank you.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.240
Lickle man, wagwan, my G.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.080
What you saying? You good, yeah?

14:24.160 --> 14:27.080
Gonna get all the girls at school
and that, you get me?

14:27.160 --> 14:29.000
Even though school's a fool's game.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.480
Yo, Dan, come out! Come out the car, bruv!

14:34.560 --> 14:37.280
What this eediyat doing, blud?
Is he alright?

14:37.360 --> 14:39.560
Yo, I'm being serious, man.
Come out the fucking car, bro.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.720
D'you think I'm playing with you?
You're getting me mad!

14:41.800 --> 14:43.280
You're alright, man. Just chill out.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.040
Come out the car, Danial, bruv!

14:47.680 --> 14:49.960
[sombre music]

14:52.920 --> 14:54.120
[phone beeps]

14:54.200 --> 14:56.320
[voicemail]
You have one new message.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.360
First new message.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.880
[Marcus] So you're probably
thinking to yourself,

15:03.960 --> 15:05.640
when is this boy gonna stop messaging me?

15:05.720 --> 15:08.200
[chuckles] Good question.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.760
Well, you'll be glad to know that this is
probably gonna be my last message to you,

15:12.840 --> 15:15.360
unless you actually choose
to message me back this time,

15:15.440 --> 15:18.120
and, well, if you do message me back

15:18.200 --> 15:21.560
then I guess I'll message you back too,
innit, and then...

15:24.120 --> 15:27.640
Listen I just wanted to get some things
off my chest real quick, yeah?

15:27.720 --> 15:31.400
You don't even have to listen to this
to be fair, but I wanted to say it.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.840
[sighs] So, here goes.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.800
Danial, come out the fucking car, bro!

15:40.440 --> 15:43.480
Listen, I ain't got time
for this shit, bro. I didn't ask for this.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.560
I'm tired, man!

15:45.640 --> 15:48.080
-[Stacks laughing]
-Huh? I'm like a dad to you, bruv!

15:49.520 --> 15:52.040
I didn't ask for this shit.
I got my own life to sort out.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.880
I'm not your dad. I'm not your mum.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.280
I'm me, bro, Marcus!

15:57.400 --> 16:00.160
And you got me running around
looking after you every day,

16:00.240 --> 16:02.640
bringing you to school, making your bed.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.600
Bro, who's looking after me, bro? No one!

16:08.920 --> 16:11.120
Do you know how it feels
to not have anyone, huh?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.480
Shit fucking hurts, man.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.400
Look, bro,

16:26.480 --> 16:28.400
I know the setup we have ain't easy, man.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.600
Me and you, like, what we have
to go through with Mum and that, like.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.760
I know it was tough,

16:34.840 --> 16:37.240
I've made some big mistakes
along the way, man.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.320
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes I did, bro.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.040
And do you know what?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.200
I know it's easy to blame Mum
for everything, bro,

16:45.280 --> 16:46.920
what we've been through and that but...

16:47.480 --> 16:49.160
In life you can't keep
blaming your mistakes

16:49.240 --> 16:51.200
on other people and circumstances.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.360
I've done that
for as long as I can remember now

16:54.440 --> 16:57.840
and it hasn't got me anywhere.
Like, I'm tired of it, man.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.080
[kisses teeth]
I used to have this feeling inside me,

17:01.960 --> 17:05.000
it was like a frustration and anger.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.320
It killed all the dreams and passions
that I ever had, you know?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.720
And I felt like, like fuck it,

17:11.800 --> 17:14.800
I'm hurt so I want
everyone else to hurt too.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.960
I just felt so angry inside, man.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.280
I was always angry, always so angry and...

17:20.800 --> 17:24.160
We can't keep being angry, bro.
We can't be angry no more.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.800
Not at Mum, not at each other,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.720
not at anything, I swear.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.440
Listen, this ain't life.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.040
We're gonna look back at this situation
in ten years and we're gonna realise, bro.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.200
I know it's hard to understand now
but, I promise you, man.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.720
You've just gotta believe it.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.200
You see guys like...
see guys like that, bro,

17:46.280 --> 17:49.160
they'll never tell you this, fam, yeah?

17:49.240 --> 17:51.040
They'll never admit it, bro.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.920
Cos they don't know
their own fucking selves, man.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.640
They're lost boys,
and they turn into lost men.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.720
Don't listen to him, man.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.640
The cycle just goes on and on
and on and on and it will never stop.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.160
It will just keep going.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.640
I want better for you, bro.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.880
More than you can ever imagine.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.320
I've been thinking like that
for the past weeks still,

18:11.440 --> 18:13.760
and at first it made me upset,
I'm not even gonna lie.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.560
I've kind of grown used to us
talking and stuff,

18:16.640 --> 18:18.560
but today I've been thinking more.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.560
And do you know what?

18:20.640 --> 18:23.440
I'm OK with it now. I'm OK.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.880
Do you know I remember
reading something once.

18:28.960 --> 18:32.080
I can't remember where I read it,
but it went something like this.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.440
Sometimes God brings someone
into your life for a period of time,

18:37.160 --> 18:38.960
a period of time that's just right.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.960
You may want that person
to stay in your life for longer

18:42.040 --> 18:44.160
but that's not what they're there for.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.920
That's not their purpose.
They have a job, to help fix you.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.000
I was broken.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.080
I didn't even know it myself,
but I was, you know.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.800
You saw that and you helped fix me.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.520
I'm better now. I'm better than I was.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.320
And if that's the only outcome
of you and me, I mean, like,

19:03.400 --> 19:07.080
all that's ever been written for us,
then that's enough.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.920
So now that's off my chest,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I guess I just wanted say thank you.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.560
Please, please, please, please, please.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.320
Answer your phone, Marcus,
answer your phone!

19:20.680 --> 19:21.960
We've been through a lot.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.880
Look at where we are, bro.
Look how far we've come.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.640
We're still here, we're still fighting.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.080
Shit! Marcus!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.680
Fuck!

19:34.760 --> 19:36.320

Danial, if you've forgotten
your fucking key, I swear!

22:04.600 --> 22:06.120
What the fuck is going on!

22:06.200 --> 22:10.640
Viv, quick! Marcus has been shot.
He's down near mine. Come quick.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.440
What? Marcus! Marcus!

[Vivian] No, don't, don't, don't!

Don't!

23:01.000 --> 23:02.240
Oh, my God!

23:02.320 --> 23:05.400
No! No, no, no, no!

Yo, what's good?

24:22.680 --> 24:26.440
I heard about your brother, man.
Keep your head up.

Please, I'm sorry.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.160
Mum!

25:50.560 --> 25:52.960
I'm sorry! Just get up!

25:53.040 --> 25:54.480
Are you hungry, Mum?

25:54.560 --> 25:57.680
I'll get you some food,
but you need to wake up!

25:57.760 --> 25:59.520
You need to get up!

26:01.080 --> 26:02.640
I'm sorry!

26:02.720 --> 26:04.800
Wake up. Mum, I'm sorry!

26:08.600 --> 26:10.160
Get up!

26:14.800 --> 26:15.840
I'm so sorry.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.560
[phone ringing]

26:41.760 --> 26:43.600
[indistinct chatter]

27:06.200 --> 27:08.920
[man] Hey, Danial.
I want you to meet Mrs Palmer.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.240
OK, she's going to be looking after you
and taking care of everything,

27:12.320 --> 27:15.720
so you don't have to worry
about a thing, OK?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.400
Now I want you to be a brave,
strong boy for me,

27:18.480 --> 27:22.040
and any problems,
you let Mrs Palmer know, OK?

27:22.800 --> 27:26.800
We'll get through this
and I'll see you soon, alright?

27:27.960 --> 27:29.200
I'll call you, yeah?

27:33.600 --> 27:35.360
[Mrs Palmer]
How are you feeling, my love?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.960
Still not up for talking much?

27:42.160 --> 27:44.760
It's OK, sometimes
I don't feel like talking either.

27:46.640 --> 27:50.800
But listen up, we have a date to go
check out your brand new home today, OK?

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
Shall we go?

28:16.640 --> 28:18.320
You're a really lucky boy, Danial.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.480
I didn't know my dad growing up.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.080
He died before I was born.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.440
Your dad sounds super excited to have you.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.800
I bet you'll have
absolutely loads to talk about.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.280
[Slim] Shit then,
you've grown a lot, innit?

28:52.440 --> 28:54.360
[Slim ] Nah, nah,
don't worry, man, he's cool.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.480

-[Slim] Yeah, yeah.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.520
I just gotta sort out this first, man.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.800
Do you want me to go?

29:13.880 --> 29:16.280
Nah, nah, nah. I'll deal with it.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.000
Follow me if you want though.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.040
Alright cool. I'm gonna wait outside.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.560
-Alright, cool.
-Nice one.

[door opens]

29:30.320 --> 29:31.400
[door closes]

29:33.160 --> 29:35.840
[Slim] So look, basically,
you're living with me now, yeah?

29:36.800 --> 29:39.400
So, I'm gonna run some rules
and regulations past you,

29:39.480 --> 29:40.960
just so we don't bump heads.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.920
First thing,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.200
no smoking in this yard,
only I do that shit.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.000
Second, no girls in this house.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.200
Only I do that shit, you hear me?

29:54.840 --> 29:57.920
And if I catch you doing any type of shit,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.320
and I mean any type of shit
that I don't like,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.680
you're in big trouble, you hear me?

30:10.040 --> 30:11.440
Alright, good.

30:12.840 --> 30:13.800
Good.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.920
Look, man,
I heard what happened to your bro.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.000
Some sad shit, man,
and I feel it for you still.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.600
But he knew
what he was getting himself into.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.800
It's just the roads.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.240
Just the way it is, man.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.400
But in this house, we keep it respectful,

30:44.480 --> 30:47.280
and we stick by the rules. Understand?

30:51.160 --> 30:53.960
Look, man, I know we don't
really know each other that much, man.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.720
It's kinda my fault still,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.120
and your mum's, to be fair.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.720
But... I'm your dad,

31:05.080 --> 31:06.320
and we can't change that.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.040
But look, the room
you're gonna be staying in,

31:13.800 --> 31:15.080
up the hallway on the left,

31:16.240 --> 31:17.440
not the one on the right.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.800
And don't ever let me catch you
going in there, you hear me?

31:23.520 --> 31:26.080
And before you say anything,
it's kind of mad in there still.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.200
But we'll pattern it up.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.480
Paint it blue or buy you some toys,

31:32.560 --> 31:34.480

Fix yourself some food, man,
or watch some telly or suttin'.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.880
But we good from earlier,
you understood the conversation, yeah?

32:26.520 --> 32:27.800
Alright, cool.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.280
There's some food in the fridge,

32:38.360 --> 32:41.000
but don't touch the smoked salmon
and the pineapple juice!

you wanna eat for dinner.

Kids with ambitions
and wild dreams and imaginations.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.440
We never wanted to be dropouts
or drug dealers

36:01.520 --> 36:05.040
and prostitutes and murderers,
gang members, addicts.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.480
It kinda chose us.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.480
We just stood by
and let it happen, that's all.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.960
Didn't do anything to change it.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.960
