00:10.011 --> 00:10.442
Who is this?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.077
MAN ON PHONE: <i> I've gotta go.</i>
<i> Business to take care of.</i>

00:12.079 --> 00:14.780
SAM: It's that creep
sending me those photographs.

00:14.782 --> 00:15.447
I recognize that voice.

00:15.449 --> 00:19.451
Johnson bullied
the South Vietnamese
into a cease-fire deal.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.520
We tell Saigon
we'll offer them

00:21.522 --> 00:23.122
a better deal
after the election.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.692
What you're suggesting
is a violation
of the Logan Act.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.626
CUT: Uh, my wife, Jeannie.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.395
Dinner smells wonderful.
We already ate.

00:29.397 --> 00:33.932
If you want some,
there's dishes in there.
You can have the rest.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.302
I'm Dennis. You got some
good music in you.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.370
MAN: <i> Miss Karn.</i>
EMMA: <i> Yes?</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.472
Mr. Wilson
sent us for you.

KRISTIN: <i> I found it,</i>
<i> the needle and the...</i>

00:44.278 --> 00:45.077
No, no, that was for work.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.579
That was just for work.
I just had to make it
look like I did.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.714
You're gonna
look me in the eye

00:48.716 --> 00:49.615
and tell me that
that's the truth?

00:49.617 --> 00:52.351

<i> Honest, that is the truth.</i>

KRISTIN: Brian,
I said breakfast. Come on.

02:19.907 --> 02:24.409
You're really
gonna be late now.
You do not look good.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.446
BRIAN: Can you take that
out of here?

02:27.448 --> 02:28.981
You're soaking wet,

02:28.983 --> 02:30.048
but you don't
have a fever.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.350
BRIAN: Please,
get it out of here.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.285
KRISTIN: Get what
out of here?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.121
BRIAN: The smell...

02:36.123 --> 02:38.257
Brian, it's just coffee.

(COUGHING)

(GROANS)

02:48.502 --> 02:49.935
What is this?

02:52.573 --> 02:53.906
I don't know.
Yes, you do.

02:53.908 --> 02:56.275
I don't know.
Yes, you do.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.044
(EXHALES)

03:00.181 --> 03:03.382
LYONS: The cam mechanism
inside the phone will
open and close six times

03:03.384 --> 03:04.816
as the dial returns
to the home position,

03:04.818 --> 03:07.352
thus sending six pulses
to the central office.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.454
How do you know
so much about this?

03:09.456 --> 03:11.256
LYONS: My old man worked
for the phone company.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.393
But anyway, it's just racks
of mechanical switches.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.794
You dial and
a line selector uses

03:15.796 --> 03:17.863
the clicks on your
rotary phone to figure out

03:17.865 --> 03:19.932
which rack to
connect your call to.

03:19.934 --> 03:22.201
You dial a five and it goes
to the five series rack.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.369
Then you dial a seven,
it goes to the seven rack

03:24.371 --> 03:26.171
in the five series,
and so on.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.806
You get it?
Nope.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.374
To trace a call on
a mechanical switch,

03:29.376 --> 03:31.043
they gotta check
where that wire runs to,

03:31.045 --> 03:32.511
then see where
that wire runs to.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.912
And if it's
a long-distance call,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.080
they gotta go to
the central office

03:35.082 --> 03:37.449
that connected that call
to the city, then...

03:37.451 --> 03:38.450
Why can't you just
say we're not gonna

03:38.452 --> 03:40.652
be able to trace
the guy that
called me?

03:40.654 --> 03:43.689
Oh, that's right.
You can never
just say anything.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.256
Well, here's a thought.

03:44.258 --> 03:47.292
Next time he calls,
just ask him where he is.

03:47.361 --> 03:47.926
Cut out the middleman.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.128
Why don't you just spill
coffee a couple more
places and say

03:50.130 --> 03:51.763
that's the way
it's supposed to look?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.465
Like a polka dot thing.

03:53.467 --> 03:53.999
Or change.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.500
Change to what?
The way you eat.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.969
You don't bring
a spare shirt to work?

03:56.971 --> 04:00.472
Last Monday, your desk
after you took down
that macaroni salad?

04:00.474 --> 04:01.807
Looked like you
don't have thumbs.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.476
"Spare shirt"?
What am I, made of shirts?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.011
You're cute.
Boy, you're not.

04:06.013 --> 04:06.712
So let me borrow a shirt.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.982
Sweet, the way you think
I'm gonna want it back.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.939
Where is she?
Who?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.108
Emma.
Mmm-mmm.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.044
I told her to go talk to you.
She didn't come back.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.413
But I thought you
were her and she is you

04:41.415 --> 04:43.115
and all that other
confetti you blow up

04:43.117 --> 04:44.249
those poor kids'
corn holes,

04:44.251 --> 04:47.152
so seems like you shouldn't
have to ask where she is.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.153
Did you tell her
to go see her

04:48.155 --> 04:50.122
mommy and daddy
or something?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.624
She wouldn't have,
even if I did.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.694
She told me she was free
and happy where she was.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.229
Unless she was lying.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.865
She wasn't.

04:59.867 --> 05:04.503
Fine. But still, your love's
all about freedom, right?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.672
So you told her to
go see me and she did?

05:06.674 --> 05:09.708
Maybe she just
kept right on going.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.510
You ever know something

05:11.512 --> 05:13.312
and you don't know
how you know it?

05:13.314 --> 05:16.248
Just know it because
you know people, Detective?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.884
You detect their
whys and wherefores.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.751
There a point to this?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.753
Emma's gone
her own way before

05:21.755 --> 05:23.322
when she wanted to.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.391
This time,
she didn't want to.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.927
You seem really
worried about it.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.330
You're sure
enjoying it, huh?

05:31.332 --> 05:34.566
Oh, yeah. Last night,
as I went to sleep,

05:34.568 --> 05:36.301
I thought, "Tomorrow
I hope to stand around

05:36.303 --> 05:37.536
"in the alley
behind the station

05:37.538 --> 05:40.639
"talking to some hairy,
bug-eyed munchkin."

05:40.641 --> 05:41.873
And here we are.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.277
You can joke
on me all you want,

05:45.346 --> 05:47.546
but something's
happened to her.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.214
Something she
didn't choose.

05:49.416 --> 05:53.051
Now, I don't
got the resources
to find out what.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.020
But you do.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.823
So I'm putting it
down here.

05:57.825 --> 06:01.560
You don't pick it up,
it'll be on you.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.464
You got enough
haunting you already.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.533
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.802
Ask a mirror, Sam.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.680
(GLASS CLINKING)

06:21.682 --> 06:23.515
KEN: <i> Ca phe sua da.</i>

06:23.617 --> 06:24.750
Is that right?

06:24.752 --> 06:28.120
<i> Ca phe sua da.</i>
Iced coffee.

06:28.222 --> 06:32.891
Well, iced milk coffee,
to be more exact.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.862
You're a lawyer.
I assume you like things
to be defined exactly.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.564
You are right, I do.
It's very strong.

06:39.566 --> 06:45.570
Saigonese, in particular,
find coffee in the West
to be, uh, ineffective.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.274
I can see that.
It's very sweet, also.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.643
Uh, that's
the condensed milk.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.345
But, please,
if you don't like it...

06:53.347 --> 06:54.946
Can I tell you?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.115
I'm a black coffee man.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.450
I was prepared to
suffer through this

06:58.452 --> 07:01.787
for diplomacy's sake,
but it's delicious.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.356
(CHUCKLES)
I'm not suffering at all.

07:06.994 --> 07:11.963
When the French
first planted coffee
in Vietnam, it thrived.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.367
A success by any
standards but theirs.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.769
They wanted
their <i> cafe au lait.</i>

07:17.771 --> 07:21.039
But we didn't have
enough dairy cows
to satisfy them.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.643
So they used condensed milk,
the canned milk,

07:24.645 --> 07:29.114
which gives it
its sweetness also.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.020
And the ice?

07:35.022 --> 07:36.221
Our country is very hot.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.857
Over the years,
a belief has arisen

07:38.859 --> 07:41.026
that <i> Ca phe sua da</i>

07:41.028 --> 07:43.528
can be a bridge
between people.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.163
Is that right? How so?

07:45.165 --> 07:49.134
Drinking it together
helps people relax.

07:49.136 --> 07:52.471
It can make messages
easier to deliver

07:52.473 --> 07:55.874
and difficult things
easier to say.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.749
(SIGHS)

08:07.554 --> 08:09.788
This 11th hour ceasefire.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.757
The peace talks in Paris.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.060
I have a message about them,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.496
a message from
my boss to yours.

08:18.398 --> 08:18.997
What is it?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.466
To hold on.
'Till after the election.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.969
Hold on
because he is gonna win,
and when he does,

08:23.971 --> 08:27.506
the Nixon presidency
will give General Thieu
the support he needs

08:27.508 --> 08:31.810
and not leave
him hung out to dry
on the world stage.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.380
A very important message,

08:35.883 --> 08:38.216
delivered very well.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.187
It's true.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.155
That coffee is a bridge.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.563
WOMAN: Okay.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.998
Okay.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.202
Meg.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.570
Who are they here to see?

08:58.572 --> 09:02.541
The one lady asked
for Sergeant Navas
about a traffic accident.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.842
That they were in?
No.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.509
She filed a missing persons

09:04.511 --> 09:08.313
that just got put together
with a hit-and-run
fatality on Rossmore.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.648
It was an older man.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.249
Her fiance, she says.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.785
Isn't that sweet?
I mean, and sad.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.053
Because he's dead. Why?

09:15.055 --> 09:17.622
There's just something
familiar about those two.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.624
But not in a good way.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.593
Olena Kravchuk.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.395
Yeah, that's not
helping very much.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.297
Did the other one sign in?
No.

09:25.299 --> 09:26.464
Go tell her
that we're keeping

09:26.466 --> 09:29.100
a statistical record
of all our walk-in visitors

09:29.102 --> 09:32.270
to better help serve
the needs of the community.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.638
We are?
Yes.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.208
Why you lurking up here?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.244
I thought Cutler
was out of town this week.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.446
I'm not lurking. Come here.

09:42.182 --> 09:46.217
Vira Boyko.
They're both Ukrainian.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.520
Maybe they remind me
of my grandma.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.688
NAVAS: She wants
the accident report on him

09:49.690 --> 09:53.358
so she can file
with California Life
Annuity Insurance.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.393
Except I don't have it,
so I gotta go check

09:55.395 --> 09:56.728
why the coroner
hasn't signed off,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.630
because I have
nothing else to do today.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.898
I could go for you.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.865
Why? Why would you
do that?

10:00.867 --> 10:02.867
There's just something
bugging me about those two.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.836
Maybe talking to Spring
will jog my memory.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.438
You won't owe me a favor,
all right?

10:06.440 --> 10:10.108
Oh, I know I won't.
I didn't ask.
You volunteered.

10:10.243 --> 10:14.446
Why can't you
just ever be happy?
You hammertoe.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.815
A hit-and-run fatality,
old guy.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.682
Sergeant Navas said
(COUGHING)

10:17.684 --> 10:20.986
you hadn't released
the accident report yet.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.021
David Koch, 77.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.391
Multiple rib fractures.
Skull fracture.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.493
I'm just waiting
on the toxicology.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.427
Why? What do you
think that'll show?

10:29.429 --> 10:32.030
SPRING: <i> Well, he didn't</i>
<i> step off a curb</i>
<i> or cross against the light</i>

10:32.032 --> 10:34.199
<i> or one of your</i>
<i> more traditional</i>
<i> hit-and-run scenarios.</i>

10:34.201 --> 10:38.603
<i> Mr. Koch got run over</i>
<i> while he was</i>
<i> lying down in an alley.</i>

10:43.243 --> 10:45.343
So I'm assuming
either liquor or drugs...

10:45.345 --> 10:46.945
That's it!

10:47.914 --> 10:49.347
You know Joe Wilson?

10:49.349 --> 10:49.981
Before my time.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.851
But we played poker
at your place once,
I think.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.451
Dear God.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.787
I'll take that.
I know what that is.

10:55.789 --> 10:59.157
So Joe's old guy
was run over when
he was lying down too?

10:59.159 --> 11:02.093
That I don't remember,
but now I do remember

11:02.095 --> 11:03.395
who showed up
to claim the body.

11:03.397 --> 11:08.466
Miss Kravchuk, Miss Boyko.
Hi, thank you for
waiting so patiently.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.036
Hodiak.
It's Ukrainian name.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.604
It is. That's right.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.272
(SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

11:14.274 --> 11:18.109
(SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

11:18.912 --> 11:20.512
That's about
the limit of my repertoire.

11:20.514 --> 11:24.616
My grandmother was from Lviv,
but she died when
I was very young.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.618
Oh, I also know
how to say,

11:26.620 --> 11:28.420
"Samson, it would make
your <i> babunia</i>

11:28.422 --> 11:31.523
"very happy if you
would become a priest."

11:31.525 --> 11:33.191
(CHUCKLES)
What's the word for priest?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.660
(SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

11:35.662 --> 11:37.228
(OLENA LAUGHS)

11:37.230 --> 11:38.029
You did not listen.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.365
I did not listen,
(CHUCKLING) no.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.233
Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.903
The report that you wanted
is not ready yet.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.905
The coroner has
a backlog of cases,

11:46.907 --> 11:49.474
and he's understaffed,
so apologies.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.677
(BOTH SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

11:53.380 --> 11:56.281
She's frustrated. Very much.

11:56.283 --> 12:02.187
Uh, she's feeling like she
cannot mourn for her loss...
Hmm.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.456
...while all of this
is overhanging.

12:04.458 --> 12:07.525
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna make
this case a priority.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.929
For my countrywomen
who remind me of
my <i> babunia,</i>  okay?

12:10.931 --> 12:15.333
But it's still gonna take
a little time, so you will
have to come back.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.668
Uh, when?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.604
Tomorrow? Okay?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.906
(SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

12:22.909 --> 12:25.577
So, what,
now they're leaving?
Yeah.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.646
But they'll be back.
Tomorrow.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.383
Oh, and, also, I think
they might be murderers.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.655
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

12:37.657 --> 12:40.058
The body's what you'd
expect from a hit-and-run.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.827
A lot of blunt force
to the upper body.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.729
He wasn't lying down.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.231
They do a toxicology?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.900
Yeah, his blood level
was Irish.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.569
In and of itself,
not suspicious.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.071
It was the crime scene
that hinked me.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.875
They found a bicycle
near him with the
front wheel removed.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.842
Well, maybe changing
a flat tire.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.245
No, they found the wheel.
It wasn't flat.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.680
No car parts
or glass frags?

13:02.682 --> 13:05.917
No headlight pieces,
no debris, nothing.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.119
And then there was
the ID he had on him.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.055
A folded-up piece of paper
with his name written on it.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.158
Yeah, but Joe,
the guy was 82.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.325
We'll be lucky,
when we're 82,

13:14.327 --> 13:16.928
if all we need reminding
about is our names.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.062
Well, you might be right,
but look,

13:18.064 --> 13:21.065
it just doesn't seem like
the note was for him so much.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.501
It seemed like
it was more for us.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.904
And then Vicky Varicose
and the other one show up

13:25.906 --> 13:29.641
claiming to be the corpse's
long-lost cousin.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.909
Asking for the case report.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.043
For the insurance policy.

13:32.045 --> 13:35.914
I mean, I wasn't happy,
but what was I gonna do?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.850
So you called me
in here to make me

13:38.852 --> 13:41.419
feel bad about
the case I shanked, huh?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.354
Here's the deal
I want to make you.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.190
I want to lock up
those two biddies.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.660
If not for murder,
then at least for
insurance fraud.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.427
In your memory.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.196
Well, I'm not dead,
but thanks.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.899
Well, it couldn't
happen to a nicer pair
of evil old broads.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.601
So what deal are we making?

13:56.603 --> 14:00.638
I've been getting
these photos sent to me.
Anonymous.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.373
Fan mail-type thing?
She cute?

14:02.375 --> 14:06.211
No. Girls tied up. Terrified.
Huh.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.080
One's been connected
to a body now.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.917
And yesterday, I got a call
at my desk from the guy.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.052
Yeah? Well, what'd he say?

14:14.054 --> 14:17.922
Nothing helpful,
but the voice
sounded familiar.

14:17.924 --> 14:20.625
And after today,
trying so hard
to remember

14:20.627 --> 14:21.960
where I knew those
grandmas from

14:21.962 --> 14:23.094
and realizing it was
one of your old cases,

14:23.096 --> 14:26.631
I thought maybe
this guy is from
one of my old cases.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.267
So I thought maybe
you could go over
my closed homicides,

14:29.269 --> 14:33.538
follow up on the actors,
maybe see if anybody's
been paroled?

14:33.540 --> 14:37.308
This is your mission.
Please choose to accept it.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.310
(INHALES SHARPLY)

14:39.746 --> 14:41.112
Thank you.

14:51.825 --> 14:52.857
Sam.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.859
Jeannie, hi.

14:54.961 --> 15:00.798
I am so sorry
we weren't at
Opal's funeral, Sam.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.734
But Ed was just
sick as a dog.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.202
I understand.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.305
Are you, uh,
looking for Ed?

15:07.307 --> 15:07.872
No, silly.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.741
He's at a leadership
conference in San Pedro.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.809
Yeah, I know.
I just didn't know if you...

15:11.811 --> 15:15.546
I made you my
three-layer ribbon loaf.

15:15.548 --> 15:15.980
You really did.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.450
I remembered
how much you loved it
at Beverly's confirmation.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.086
Yes, I said that.
You did.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.688
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:23.690 --> 15:26.124
The top layer is
shrimp salad,

15:26.593 --> 15:28.660
middle is nut and olive,

15:28.662 --> 15:31.129
then deviled ham and pimento.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.231
So much chopping.
(CHUCKLES)
Hmm.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.166
(STUTTERS) That whole
loaf is for me?

15:35.168 --> 15:38.102
Hope you're hungry.
(CHUCKLES)
(WHISTLES)

15:40.540 --> 15:41.806
So where are the kids?

15:41.808 --> 15:45.777
Um, they're at my sister's.
Hmm.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.780
So you made this
three-layer ribbon loaf

15:48.782 --> 15:52.684
and put on this
lovely outfit

15:52.686 --> 15:55.386
and dropped your kids off
with your sister,

15:55.388 --> 15:58.957
and drove all the way here
from Hancock Park,

15:58.959 --> 16:02.293
while Ed was in
San Pedro, for me?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.462
(SNIFFLES)

16:04.464 --> 16:07.799
Oh, Jeannie. Jeannie.
(SOBS) Oh, Sam.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.234
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.736
No, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.972
I don't think
you thought this through.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.607
I just... (SNIFFLES LOUDLY)
(MOUTHING)

16:16.810 --> 16:19.377
I can't. I'm so...

16:19.879 --> 16:21.879
Tired. I'm so...

16:23.817 --> 16:25.316
(SOBS)

16:26.653 --> 16:28.519
Oh, come on.
Come on. Come on.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.555
JEANNIE: I'm sorry.
You must think
I'm so stupid.

16:30.557 --> 16:34.158
No one thinks
you're stupid, Jeannie.
Oh.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.728
Ed thinks I'm stupid.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.696
No, Ed loves you.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.198
No.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.301
Ed had an affair
with Opal.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.737
Did you know that?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.206
I'll just bet you did.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.640
I know Ed made a mistake.

16:49.642 --> 16:55.046
And I know he's sorry.
And I know that
doesn't justify it.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.481
And I know
that you're a saint

16:56.483 --> 17:00.551
and he doesn't deserve you
and you don't deserve this.
(EXHALES)

17:00.653 --> 17:02.120
And I also
don't want to be the one

17:02.122 --> 17:03.388
that tells tales
out of school,

17:03.390 --> 17:05.957
but I know that
when Ed gets back,

17:05.959 --> 17:09.093
he's gonna take you
on a big, romantic trip.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.562
To Catalina.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.831

17:14.367 --> 17:16.901

Well, (SNIFFLES)
that'll be lovely.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.311
Mmm-hmm.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.312
(CHUCKLES)

17:28.314 --> 17:30.114
I won't tell him
I knew about it.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.849
No. That's a good idea.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

17:38.158 --> 17:39.457

Like your place.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.433
It's real cozy.

17:57.277 --> 18:01.746
Get up. Get up
and hands on the wall.
(GRUNTS)

18:02.015 --> 18:03.214
(LAUGHS)

18:03.216 --> 18:05.016
You misunderstand
me, friend.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.953
Maybe so,
because I sure don't get
why you're laughing.

18:09.489 --> 18:13.858
I almost beat you to death
in your own house once.
I find you in mine.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.027
Why wouldn't
I just shoot you?

18:16.029 --> 18:19.330
Even in the face of death,
I do not cling to life.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.732
I was an altar boy,
you derelict. Sit down.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.201
Don't quote
scripture to me

18:23.203 --> 18:24.836
and think that I'm gonna
think you made it up.

18:24.838 --> 18:28.539
Now, what were you
trying to prove,
doing this? Huh?

18:28.541 --> 18:29.574
Just showing me
you were good

18:29.576 --> 18:31.476
at sneaking into places
you're not wanted?

18:31.478 --> 18:32.376
I already knew that.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.546
I came to ask
if you'd found Emma.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.383
Not yet.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.656
Like your
music boxes, man.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.392
About to see how they...
Sit down!

18:52.932 --> 18:54.365
How'd you find
my address, anyway?

18:54.367 --> 18:58.236
I was wandering around
outside your station house,

18:58.238 --> 19:01.472
'till I come upon
a pink-cheeked
young buck in uniform.

19:01.474 --> 19:05.510
And I told him I was
your confidential
criminal informant

19:05.512 --> 19:08.946
and that you had told me
to meet you at your place,

19:08.948 --> 19:12.250
of which I had
forgot the address.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.558
I was waiting on the landing
for you for a while,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.728
but then I, uh,
saw your balcony.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.463
Made me wonder.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.267
And I don't like to wonder.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.736
I like to know.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.309
What's that
you dropped there?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.511
Oh, that is a...

19:40.513 --> 19:42.947
That is a three-layer
frosted ribbon loaf.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.782
Loaf of cake
or bread or...

19:44.784 --> 19:46.584
I don't know.
I'm not sure. It's unclear.

19:46.586 --> 19:50.988
You're welcome to try to
find out, if you'd like.
Investigate.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.594

You got a woman?
No.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.439
You been married?

20:08.741 --> 20:10.875
You seem like
you'd be married.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.512
Not that you'd want to
but that you would be.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.082
I've been married. You?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.384
Yeah, a couple of times.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.120
Oh.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.156
Give me a taste.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.458
I'll tell you a tale.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.596
Rosalie.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.332
Her dad was
a good buddy of mine,

20:34.334 --> 20:36.934
when I was working
at Wheeling Downs.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.502
You, working?

20:38.504 --> 20:38.869
Yes, sir,

20:38.871 --> 20:41.772
clearing out the stables,
taking care of the horses.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.643
Anyway, Cowboy Willis,
Rosie was his daughter.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.946
We wanted to make
a life for ourselves
in California, you know.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.015
Get away from people
thinking they knew all

20:51.017 --> 20:54.151
what we were,
you know, but... (SNIFFLES)

20:56.656 --> 20:59.757
I keep thinking
the frosting's gonna
be sweet,

21:00.026 --> 21:01.726
but it's more like a cheese.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.061
How about Rosalie?

21:04.163 --> 21:07.465
See, right before we left,
Rosie got pregnant.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.934
So I stole a Mercury
to drive us out.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.503
Wanted her to
be comfortable, you know.

21:12.505 --> 21:17.108
But in LA, some cop
runs our license plates,

21:17.110 --> 21:20.111
and, uh, my probation
gets revoked.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.213
Three years in Terminal.

21:23.216 --> 21:24.682
What did Rosie do?

21:25.318 --> 21:27.418
Uh, she kept with me
for a while.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.454
You know, bring the kid
to visit and such. (CHUCKLES)

21:30.456 --> 21:35.893
But then, she served me
with the papers while
I was in the joint.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.396
Last I heard,
she and Charlie Junior

21:38.398 --> 21:40.197
were living with
some farmer cat

21:40.199 --> 21:40.731
back in Appalachia.

21:40.733 --> 21:43.634
You said you married twice.
Who was the second one?

21:44.203 --> 21:45.403
Aw.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.804
Leona.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.006
She was one of my girls.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.709
We got arrested
in New Mexico.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.444
I was pimping her
out in Lordsburg.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.880
You were pimping out
your own wife?

21:55.882 --> 21:56.947
Wasn't married then.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.950
No, after Lordsburg,
I was looking at
the Mann Act.

21:59.952 --> 22:03.854
So I married her
so she couldn't
testify against me.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.657
That's smart. Smart.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.126
Yeah. She did, though.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.662
They scared her into it.

22:11.898 --> 22:16.067
Wouldn't have been hard,
her being pregnant and all.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.003
What did Leona do then?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.138
She stuck around
for two, three years.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.040
Didn't come up
to visit, though.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.242
Never met the kid.
(INHALES DEEPLY)

22:25.244 --> 22:28.479
Nah. She ended up taking
him back to Denver.

22:28.981 --> 22:32.350
Another Charlie Junior,
in case you're wondering.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.419
So you got one boy
you've seen a couple times

22:35.421 --> 22:37.688
and one
you've never seen, huh?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.157
That's tough.
Maybe.

22:40.827 --> 22:45.963
Or, you know,
maybe it's like any other
change you pass through.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.866
Expands your
consciousness, man.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.969
Pain is like fear.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.671
Helps you grow,

22:53.673 --> 22:56.741
grow so you can
get to the now.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.109
(CHUCKLES)

22:58.845 --> 23:00.177
What?

23:00.480 --> 23:03.013
You don't believe it?
No.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.815
Neither do you.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.751
No?

23:07.820 --> 23:08.352
Why do you say that?

23:08.354 --> 23:12.089
You don't use your pain
and fear to get anyplace.

23:12.091 --> 23:16.193
You don't use them to grow.
You don't use them at all.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.464
You use people.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.233
You think you deserve to.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.068
And your pain
and your fear

23:24.070 --> 23:26.837
are the reasons
you think you do.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.409
I'm a detective, remember?

23:32.745 --> 23:35.513
I detect the whys
and the wherefores.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.051
Damn it, I'm gonna
eat some of that.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.753
Now, you want some more?

23:42.755 --> 23:47.491
Let's try not to be savages.
Let's use some silverware.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.807
KRISTIN:
Need another blanket?

24:02.809 --> 24:04.141
I don't know.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.444
No. (CLEARS THROAT)

24:07.113 --> 24:08.379
No.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.048
(SIGHS)

24:13.553 --> 24:14.652
What is that?

24:14.654 --> 24:18.189
It's grapefruit juice
and a peanut butter sandwich.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.490
(GROANS)

24:20.026 --> 24:20.991
(EXHALES)

24:20.993 --> 24:22.526
Milk of magnesia.

24:23.029 --> 24:23.928
It's supposed to help

24:23.930 --> 24:26.864
with constipation
and diarrhea.

24:27.066 --> 24:31.268
Not sure how it
could do both, exactly.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.003
Who says?

24:35.475 --> 24:36.974
Who said that?

24:37.910 --> 24:39.376
My brother.

24:39.445 --> 24:43.781
I called, and I told him
that my social welfare class

24:43.783 --> 24:46.050
was talking
about drug addiction.

24:46.419 --> 24:50.588
And I asked about those
VA detox programs

24:50.590 --> 24:52.656
and what goes on in those.

24:54.393 --> 24:57.728
I told him that
it was for me, for school.

24:57.730 --> 24:58.729
(GROANING)

24:58.731 --> 25:00.064
Cramp. Cramp.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.499
Okay, let me rub it.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.767
Just...
No! No.

25:04.437 --> 25:06.237
Don't touch me.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.606
(CONTINUES GROANING)

25:21.420 --> 25:24.421
He said that
the length of withdrawal

25:24.423 --> 25:27.224
depends on how long
the person's been taking

25:27.226 --> 25:30.160
heroin and how much of it.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.398
And he said however long

25:34.400 --> 25:38.435
and however much
the person says,

25:38.437 --> 25:41.305
it's always longer
and more.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.148
Leadership.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.417
Communication skills.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.018
If you say so.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.922
Five million guys saying so.
Lawyers, bankers.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.290
You know,
out at Terminal Island,

25:59.292 --> 26:01.025
there's a waiting list
to take the course,

26:01.027 --> 26:01.926
because if you do it right,

26:01.928 --> 26:05.596
(CHUCKLES) you could sell
ice to an Eskimo, Jack.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.265
Hell, you're doing it
in your job and you
don't even know it.

26:08.267 --> 26:12.269
Oh, yeah? I'm winning friends
and influencing people?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.237
You sure are.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.972
Because you're
pushing an idea,

26:14.974 --> 26:16.674
an idea that some
two-bit schmo

26:16.676 --> 26:19.410
sitting across from you
should jam himself up,

26:19.412 --> 26:22.212
put himself in jail,
on your say-so.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.715
Now, he doesn't
want to buy that.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.517
How do you make him?

26:26.519 --> 26:28.619
You tell me,
Dale Carnegie.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.188
You begin in
a friendly manner,

26:31.190 --> 26:33.324
you know,
genuinely interested.

26:33.326 --> 26:34.224
You let him do the talking.

26:34.226 --> 26:37.428
(CHUCKLES)
You make the fault
seem easy to correct.

26:37.430 --> 26:41.865
You arouse in him
an eager want, right? Yeah.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.401
You appeal to
his nobler motives.

26:44.403 --> 26:48.639
You let that man feel that
the idea is all his.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.742
Is that what you do
with those young girls?

26:51.744 --> 26:54.678
How you get them
to leave their mamas
and come serve you,

26:54.680 --> 26:57.481
naked and barefoot,
up in Topanga?

26:57.483 --> 26:59.717
You make them think
it was their idea?

27:00.319 --> 27:02.353
Ain't in Topanga no more.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.688
That place was
locked into a bad trip.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.957
You seemed pretty happy
up there to me.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.392
Lucky for me, then,

27:08.394 --> 27:11.895
I met a guy
at the tippy top of it
in the music world.

27:11.897 --> 27:15.332
And he gave me and mine
a standing invitation.

27:15.534 --> 27:18.902
Good for you.
Lives up above Sunset.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.204
Up there in the hills.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.905
Rolls and a Ferrari.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.408
Must be nice.
It is.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.478
What did you say
he does again?

27:27.480 --> 27:29.780
He's a musician, man.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.349
Dennis Wilson.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.251
Right, right.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.755
The Beach Boys?
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

27:37.923 --> 27:38.622
I'm surprised, though. You.

27:38.624 --> 27:42.426
I mean, he seems
a little all-American
for you. A little...

27:42.628 --> 27:44.728
A little hokey,
a little square?

27:44.730 --> 27:48.832
Well, that's his part
he has to play.

27:48.968 --> 27:52.803
But, uh, inside, he's looking
for something real.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.204
Just like I am.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.007
Is that what it is
about Emma?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.176
What what is?

27:59.178 --> 28:01.412
You got a lot of
girls around you.

28:02.081 --> 28:02.646
More all the time.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.915
And it makes sense
for a guy coming
from being a pimp,

28:04.917 --> 28:08.686
but what doesn't
make sense to me
is your focus on Emma.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.323
What is she, the prettiest?
Best in the sack?

28:13.592 --> 28:16.160
Lord knows
she's not the most obedient.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.361
(CHUCKLES)

28:17.363 --> 28:20.431
Well, she's finding
her way.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.934
Got a lot of programing
to get free of,

28:23.936 --> 28:25.936
but, uh, she's a good girl,
helpful girl.

28:25.938 --> 28:32.042
Must be (CHUCKLES)
very helpful, for you to
ask a cop to help find her.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.445
Especially me.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.215
What's she
so helpful with?

28:38.484 --> 28:40.284
It's just something...

28:41.120 --> 28:43.754
Something that's
fascinating about her.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.958
I don't know
if I even know what it is,

28:48.461 --> 28:50.527
but, uh,
people can't get enough.

28:50.529 --> 28:54.531
People like, uh,
Dennis Wilson
of The Beach Boys?

28:54.533 --> 28:57.534
Dennis for sure,
but his buddies too.

28:57.536 --> 29:01.038
You know, his big
world-by-the-tail buddies.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.607
People like Gregg Jakobson,
Terry Melcher.

29:03.609 --> 29:07.111
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
Terry's the son of
a damn movie star,

29:07.113 --> 29:11.248
but one look at Emma,
she's got him.

29:11.851 --> 29:15.853
Maybe she's the real
you all are looking for
so hard.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.689
Maybe.

29:18.691 --> 29:20.257
Maybe she left you.

29:21.193 --> 29:25.429
So maybe the real
isn't looking for you.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.999
There's a whole world
out there that's real.

29:29.001 --> 29:32.503
A whole world that starts
where this one ends.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.707
You know, maybe our love
has been corrupted so bad

29:36.709 --> 29:39.977
that you and I,
we just can't see it anymore.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.678
Hmm.

29:42.348 --> 29:43.614
I've seen it.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.315
(INHALES SHARPLY)

29:45.818 --> 29:47.751
More than once.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.688
Had a different name
every time.

29:52.892 --> 29:56.727
Kwajalein, Leyte, Okinawa.

29:57.663 --> 30:02.032
Yep. Plainfield.
School for Boys.

30:02.635 --> 30:07.704
Thirteen, I was ganged
in the feed bins
in the dairy silo.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.875
They used tobacco juice.

30:11.877 --> 30:15.445
I asked Jesus to come
and take me, but, uh...

30:17.016 --> 30:18.816
He wasn't listening.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.955
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

30:25.391 --> 30:26.757
Now...

30:26.859 --> 30:30.460
Why would I tell you
something like that?

30:33.732 --> 30:35.132
Must be this rotgut here.

30:35.134 --> 30:40.704
Or maybe I aroused in you
an eager want to tell.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.757

not the drainpipe.

Huh.

But, uh...

32:45.531 --> 32:47.631
What about our business?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.099
You finding Emma.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.902
I'll look for Emma today.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.143
Oh.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.483
Hmm.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.719

Tomorrow.

Yeah.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.147
Thank you.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.783

34:15.487 --> 34:17.254
For being kind,

from over there

34:34.173 --> 34:36.973
about all these
grunts he knew

34:36.975 --> 34:39.443
who were using
to get through it.

34:40.946 --> 34:44.114
To chase away
the things they had to do

34:44.516 --> 34:47.584
or just not think
about being there.

34:49.822 --> 34:51.922
And then he came home.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.092
And he brought you
with him.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.328
You wore a green dress.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.165
Reading a book.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.469
Poetry.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.739
Gwendolyn Brooks.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.711
Were you doing it then?

35:22.721 --> 35:25.322
No. Not anymore.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.729
I didn't know what I was
looking at exactly

35:32.731 --> 35:35.332
but I knew
something was there,

35:35.901 --> 35:38.335
enough that I almost
asked right then

35:38.337 --> 35:41.037
whether one of those
grunts had been you.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.307
Almost.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.478
But I didn't ask.

35:50.349 --> 35:53.550
I saw it in you
the moment that I met you.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.020
And I married you anyway.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.491
So, no, I am not
being kind right now.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.662
I am just accepting the part
of this that's mine.
(GROANS)

36:05.664 --> 36:09.432
Okay, just lift
your toes up like this.

36:10.102 --> 36:11.735
(GRUNTING)

36:13.405 --> 36:15.605
(SOBBING)

36:18.610 --> 36:20.377
I'm sorry, baby.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.550
I'm sorry, baby.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.923
Can I leave
a message? Great.

36:32.925 --> 36:37.260
Can you have him call
Detective Sam Hodiak
at the Hollywood Division?

36:37.262 --> 36:39.996
No, it's not about
anything he's done. Mmm-mmm.

36:39.998 --> 36:44.301
It's information
on a matter that
concerns him, yes.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.169
Thank you. Thank you.

36:46.171 --> 36:48.805
JOE: Mike Devoe was
kicked to death in the yard.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.175
Stu Wilkinson died of
some kind of cancer.

36:52.177 --> 36:52.642
Oh, no.

36:52.644 --> 36:56.780
And Lonny Thompson
fell off the tier at Chino.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.682
Jaime Perez was old.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.218
SAM: It's all
good news to me.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.758
You know,
I've been thinking about...

37:08.894 --> 37:09.793
Might want to come back.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.928
Come back where, here?
Detective Squad?

37:11.930 --> 37:13.363
Yeah, I've been
thinking about it.

37:13.365 --> 37:16.433
No, no, you got it made.
You're self-employed.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.001
Yeah, (CHUCKLES)
but I hate my boss.

37:18.003 --> 37:19.336
But you don't
remember how it is.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.937
It's all paperwork
and phone calls,

37:20.939 --> 37:23.540
and you hate the phone,
and you can't spell.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.342
Remember, the Loo
used to offer cash prizes

37:25.344 --> 37:27.344
to anyone who could
translate your reports?

37:27.346 --> 37:28.211
Remember "gralefrit"?

37:28.213 --> 37:30.046
Grapefruit.
And you knew what I meant.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.849
Gralefrit. Gralefrit.
(JOE CHUCKLES)

37:33.051 --> 37:35.051
He here?
Tell him to sit tight.
Yep.

37:35.053 --> 37:40.056
All right, I have a plan,
and I was gonna use
one of the guys here.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.592
But since
you want to be unretired,

37:42.828 --> 37:45.128
I guess that guy is you.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.033
Ladies.

37:50.035 --> 37:53.069
(ALL SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

37:53.171 --> 37:56.840
Hi.
Uh, we came back,
how you say.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.409
We know you were busy.
SAM: Mmm-hmm.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.443
But if you have report,
we can go.

38:00.445 --> 38:04.581
Oh, I'm sorry, the report
is not quite ready,
but this is perfect timing,

38:04.583 --> 38:06.116
because this gentleman
showed up today,

38:06.118 --> 38:08.218
and he needed
some more information.

38:08.220 --> 38:09.419
And it makes
more sense for him

38:09.421 --> 38:11.988
to get it from you
than from me, so...

38:11.990 --> 38:13.223
And, uh, he's who?

38:13.225 --> 38:16.726
George Babbitt,
from California Life
Annuity Insurance.

38:16.728 --> 38:20.597
Just have some questions,
some policy discrepancies.

38:20.866 --> 38:21.931
Can I make a phone call?

38:21.933 --> 38:23.600
And then is there
somewhere I can question

38:23.602 --> 38:24.701
Misses Boyko and Kravchuk?

38:24.703 --> 38:27.170
Absolutely.
Officer Frazetta?
Yes.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.905
If you'd just follow me.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.807
(SIGHS)

38:30.809 --> 38:32.208
Right here.

38:32.411 --> 38:37.080
Can I get you
ladies any coffee or...
OLENA: No.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.751
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

38:43.588 --> 38:46.356
I mean, personally,
I could stand here all day.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.491
"Oh, Sammy, I want
to be a cop again.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.261
"I want to come back
to the station."

38:53.665 --> 38:55.298
(BOTH GRUNTING)

38:57.002 --> 38:58.435
Holy...

38:58.637 --> 39:00.337
(SPEAKING IN UKRAINIAN)

39:00.339 --> 39:02.339
Separate them!

39:03.275 --> 39:06.976
Separate. I'll be...
All right, I'll be in
in a minute.

39:08.347 --> 39:12.182
Joe, this is my uncle,
Danilo Hodiak.
Oh.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.350
Those two nasty biddies
were from

39:13.352 --> 39:15.919
an old case of Joe's,
Joe Wilson.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.821
It's a pleasure.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.023
Well, anyway.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.392
What do you got?

39:22.861 --> 39:27.697
The one standing says to her,
"You see what's happening?"

39:27.699 --> 39:30.066
The one sitting says,
"Be quiet."

39:30.068 --> 39:33.236
The one standing says,
"We didn't have any problems.

39:33.238 --> 39:36.539
"This is all your fault
because you're greedy."

39:36.541 --> 39:41.478
Oh.
And then the one sitting says,
"That's what you say."

39:41.713 --> 39:43.446
And the one standing says,

39:43.448 --> 39:49.652
"Oh, sure.
He loved his wife and cousin
he didn't even know he had."

39:49.654 --> 39:52.288
I knew it. And that's
when the one sitting

39:52.290 --> 39:53.323
went for the jugular, right?

39:53.325 --> 39:58.161
No. She went for
the jugular when she said,

39:58.163 --> 40:01.631
"You're going to jail,
Vira, honey.

40:01.633 --> 40:05.368
"They are gonna
lock you up."

40:06.238 --> 40:08.505
And bingo. (CHUCKLES)

40:09.307 --> 40:10.874
(PHONE RINGING)

40:12.110 --> 40:14.744
Hello.
SAM: <i> Sam Hodiak.</i>

40:15.847 --> 40:18.047
Really?
What do you want?

40:18.049 --> 40:19.849
I want to know
where Emma is.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.085
What do you mean,
where she is?

40:22.087 --> 40:23.653
You know where she is.
She's with...

40:23.655 --> 40:26.556
No, she isn't.
Did she come back home?

40:28.794 --> 40:30.293
No.

40:30.295 --> 40:32.796
<i> Do you know</i>
<i> where she might be?</i>

40:36.034 --> 40:37.100
Ask my wife.

40:37.102 --> 40:37.667
I'm asking you.

40:37.669 --> 40:43.206
Well, I don't know,
so I'm telling you,
ask my wife.

40:48.513 --> 40:49.913
(SIGHS)

40:59.324 --> 41:00.557
There's a call
for you, Detective.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.525
If you're leaving,
I can take a message.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.093
Uh, who is it?

41:04.262 --> 41:05.962
A Dennis Wilson.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.096
I'll take it here.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.132
Okay. It's on line two.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.503
Yeah, Mr. Wilson.
Hi, this is Detective Hodiak.

41:13.505 --> 41:16.673
Thanks for getting
back to me. I'm a big fan.

41:17.209 --> 41:20.176
Yeah, no, I'm calling about
a houseguest of yours,

41:20.178 --> 41:21.678
a Charles Manson?

41:21.680 --> 41:24.614
Yeah. Do you have a minute
to talk about him?

41:24.616 --> 41:27.750
Because it would
be remiss of me,
as an officer of the law,

41:27.752 --> 41:30.653
not to tell you
everything I know.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.923
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:11.930 --> 42:14.731
Rise.
