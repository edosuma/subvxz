WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:02.041
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.120 --> 00:03.121
Arrest him.

00:03.200 --> 00:04.201
Black Claw wiped out HW.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.483
Which way?
She went after Bonaparte.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.800
We used the stick to heal her.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.808
And then she Woged
and had some kind of seizure.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.086
You're feeling stuff.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.281
No.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.496
They believed that if
you took a pure soul with you,

00:16.520 --> 00:18.921
you could trade your way
into eternal afterlife.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.522
I saw these symbols
on his face when I was there

00:22.600 --> 00:24.125
and also on the cloth.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.680
I can't see what you're seeing.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.530
Somebody made me kill Bonaparte.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.205
She was Renard's
campaign PR person.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.442
Captain Renard's fingerprints
are all over that place.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.806
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed

00:37.880 --> 00:39.096
these two cops when
he was busted out.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.690
We just put out an APB on him

00:40.760 --> 00:42.171
with a shoot-to-kill order.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.488
I'm on the run,
and I need a place to hide.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.687
They know about Bud.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.936
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
It's in front of his shop.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.360
They're watching it-Nick,
you've got to get out of there now.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.726
We're in position, sir.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.131
Take them down.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.406
This is Alpha team-In position-

01:15.840 --> 01:17.683
They're coming.
What are we gonna do?

01:26.360 --> 01:28.203
- Truck's clear.
- Roger that.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360
Let's take them on.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.686
Rosalee's pregnant.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.842
Monroe! I'm sorry.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.684
Whoa! You're pregnant?

01:37.520 --> 01:39.045
Right now?

01:39.720 --> 01:41.210
Oh, my God, that's wonderful!

01:41.280 --> 01:42.930
I mean, it would be if we...

01:43.040 --> 01:44.644
That's great news.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.286
I'm so sorry I dragged you guys into this.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.044
Everybody into the back, now.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.176
I've got to turn myself in.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.043
No, Nick, you can't! No.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.600
We're in position. Are
we clear to move in?

02:01.200 --> 02:03.123
We're ready to execute.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.568
Repeat, we are ready to
execute-Do you copy?

02:09.720 --> 02:10.960
You two are in the wrong place.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.256
I told you to stay out of this.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.376
Sean Renard,
you are under arrest...

02:13.400 --> 02:14.401
You can't arrest me.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.536
For the murder of Rachel Wood.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.936
Surrender your weapon
and your badge.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.776
Like hell I Will. What the
hell are you guys doing?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.120
Do not interfere
with this arrest.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.120
What the hell is going on?

02:22.960 --> 02:25.167
You're not coming back from this.
Execute your mission.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.360
You are relieved of command.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.164
You are no longer giving orders.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.927
You have the right to remain silent.
Arrest these men!

02:31.000 --> 02:33.162
Stay out of it, guys!
This is a capital crime.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.964
Nick, you are not
giving yourself up.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.561
Then what do we do?

02:36.640 --> 02:38.369
They're coming in here.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.889
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.846
Now move out of my way.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.736
There's a fugitive
in that building.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.761
Take it down!

02:51.400 --> 02:53.767
Ignore him. He's
no longer in command.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.885
Now what?

03:09.320 --> 03:10.321
Clear to move.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.085
Nobody move! Hands up! Hands up!

03:16.160 --> 03:19.607
I'm Nick Burkhardt.
I'm the one you want.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.642
We have Burkhardt in custody.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.926
Roger that.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.606
Turn around.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.245
What the hell is this?

04:15.840 --> 04:18.366
Maybe they shouldn't have
tried to take that from you.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
SERT Team Leader, status?

04:24.040 --> 04:25.530
What a mess.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.203
You better think about
what you're doing.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.324
We're doing our job.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.291
You're not helping Burkhardt.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.885
I suggest you take me back now.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.282
We're not taking you back.
You're under arrest.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.806
Burkhardt's a dead man.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.046
Whatever happens to Nick
is gonna happen to you.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.405
What's taking so long?

04:56.480 --> 04:57.936
They should've brought out
Burkhardt by now.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.450
Checking on our Team Leader.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.885
What's the status?

05:02.680 --> 05:04.125
Report in!

05:05.720 --> 05:07.210
Holy crap!

05:07.280 --> 05:08.566
Burkhardt got away!

05:08.640 --> 05:10.768
Going South on Milwaukee.
We are in pursuit!

05:10.840 --> 05:13.161
Close off Milwaukee.
Set up a perimeter.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.329
We can't go far. We're
gonna have to dump it.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.616
Then you've got to
get out of sight.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.160
I can't stay with
anybody who knows me.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.529
The tunnels!
Dude, it's the safest place.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.656
I can't get back to the tunnels
without going through the loft,

05:52.680 --> 05:53.736
and they're watching the loft.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.603
No, we found a way out. What?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.256
Rosalee and me.
It's like a little trapdoor

05:57.280 --> 05:58.566
down by the railroad tracks.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.336
You'd never see it
unless you knew it was there.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.361
HOW do I find it?

06:01.440 --> 06:03.840
It's like a couple blocks from the loft.
I'll draw you a map.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.560
You and Rosalee need to
get back to the Spice Shop.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.129
You shouldn't be
anywhere near me right now.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.689
You really think this
is gonna go anywhere?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.444
We take our job
seriously, Captain.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.682
Yes, I appreciate your
dedication, really,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.656
but don't you think you're
making a pretty big mistake?

07:20.680 --> 07:23.445
You were arrested for the
murder of Rachel Wood.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.204
Where were you the night
she was murdered?

07:25.280 --> 07:26.336
I don't know when
she was murdered.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.856
You didn't seem surprised
when we told you.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.325
I did not kill Rachel Wood.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.447
But you knew she was dead,

07:30.520 --> 07:31.696
and you were in her apartment,

07:31.720 --> 07:33.290
and your fingerprints
are all over it.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.441
Including the bedroom.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.216
Now, why don't you tell us
about your relationship

07:36.240 --> 07:38.129
with your
public relations manager?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.576
Now, if you think
that going after me

07:43.600 --> 07:44.736
is somehow gonna help Burkhardt,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.091
then you two might wanna

07:46.160 --> 07:47.685
reconsider a career
in law enforcement.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.376
Now, we know your relationship with
her was more than professional.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.200
We can put you at the
scene of the crime, sir.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.486
And give you motive.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.520
Oh, well, I can't wait to
hear what that might be.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.724
You were running for mayor.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.450
You wanted to present
a happy family.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.056
The woman you were
having an affair with

08:01.080 --> 08:02.320
threatens to blackmail you,

08:02.840 --> 08:04.808
endanger your
political ambitions.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.406
So you kill her.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.290
Seems like that'd be pretty
easy for a jury to understand.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.320
This will never go to trial,
and you know it.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.449
If you didn't kill her, who did?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.689
The only person we can
place there is you.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.446
Rachel's dead-
Suffocated to death-In her bed-

08:21.560 --> 08:24.245
And it wasn't an accident or
something a normal person could do-

08:24.320 --> 08:27.449
I didn't think she was capable
at such a young age, but...

08:27.880 --> 08:29.450
Tell us where
you were last night.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.961
I was with my campaign adviser.
Name.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.650
Think carefully
about what you're doing.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.443
Name!

08:36.280 --> 08:37.645
You gonna take this to trial?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.126
Name.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.361
Conrad Bonaparte.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.601
Where can we find him?

08:54.520 --> 08:55.521
He left the country.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.810
And you with no alibi.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.570
I'm calling my lawyer.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.961
Hello?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.650
Will you accept
a collect call from

09:22.720 --> 09:25.087
Sean Renard at
the Portland precinct jail?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.400
I guess.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.003
Ada/ind. What's going on?

09:30.640 --> 09:32.085
I've been arrested for murder.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.282
Really? Who'd you kill?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.400
I didn't kill anybody.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.050
Well, who do they
think you killed?

09:40.680 --> 09:41.681
Rachel Wood.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.761
Oh.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.966
Yeah.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.249
So listen to me very closely.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.816
I need you to get
somebody to watch the kids

09:48.840 --> 09:50.000
and get down here right away.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.041
Why?

09:51.640 --> 09:53.483
Because you're gonna
get me out of here.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.403
This isn't right, Captain.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.245
Anything you need, let me know.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.926
Get me a phone.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.440
How long can we keep him in there?
I don't know.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.561
No bail on a murder case,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.244
but he's got
a lot of connections.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.651
What happens if he gets out?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.165
Not good for us.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.696
If he comes after me,
I'm telling you now,

10:46.720 --> 10:48.563
one of us is not
walking away from it.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.680
I know how you feel. All
right, I'll call you back.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.216
Hey, you wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.366
Where's Nick?

10:55.440 --> 10:56.771
I don't know. He got away.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.126
How'd he do that?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.281
You tell me.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.456
When we found the SERT team,

11:00.480 --> 11:01.736
they were unconscious
on the floor.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.616
Nick was gone. Not one of
them knew what happened.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.802
SERT team leader woke up
in a truck six miles away,

11:05.880 --> 11:07.803
has no idea how he got there.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.166
None of it makes any sense,

11:09.240 --> 11:10.890
including you
arresting the Captain.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.961
What was that about?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.840
Just going where
the evidence takes us.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.806
Well, I'm glad it wasn't me
who had to arrest him.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.291
But if you get
a line on Burkhardt,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.004
tell him to turn himself in...

11:20.080 --> 11:22.162
because next time
they're gonna shoot first.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.844
- Griffin.
- Hank, it's me.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.921
Trubel, where are you?

11:27.040 --> 11:29.850
We're going back to the tunnels
through the way Monroe found.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.410
And we need you
to come out here.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.211
Go through the loft,
and if anybody's watching,

11:34.280 --> 11:35.696
they'll just think
you're looking for him.

11:35.720 --> 11:36.776
All right. Put it on speaker.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.961
Nick's got to hear this.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.209
Yeah. We arrested Renard.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.486
Tell you about it later.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.803
At least he's off
the street for a while.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.405
They arrested Renard?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.050
Whoa, he can't be
too happy about that.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.849
He's not, but I am.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.366
Uh, sure we're not
being followed, right?

11:52.480 --> 11:53.606
They can't be following us.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.816
They don't know where we are.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.896
Well, they know where I work.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.576
It's not gonna take them long
to figure out where I live.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.616
What am I gonna tell my wife?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.847
Nothing, until we figure
out what they know.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.400
Hey, hey! That could be it.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.965
That looks like
an old furnace door.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.447
Without a furnace.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.851
This has got to be it.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.290
My wife is gonna miss me
eventually, and I'm gonna miss her.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.496
I mean, how long do you think

12:27.520 --> 12:28.880
we're gonna have to
live down here?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.206
I don't know, Bud.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.320
Well, maybe it's just better
if she thinks I'm dead.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.845
Why would she think
you're dead, Bud?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.126
Well, I'm missing, aren't I?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.850
Oh, God, you think
they're in danger?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.241
Could they try to get to you
through me through them?

12:39.360 --> 12:40.646
Oh, we'll have someone reach out

12:40.720 --> 12:42.085
to your wife and kids, Bud,

12:42.160 --> 12:45.289
but they might wanna leave
Portland for a little while.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.886
Oh, my God, if anything were
to happen to my family...

12:47.960 --> 12:49.216
Bud, as soon as we're done here,

12:49.240 --> 12:50.560
we'll make sure
they're all right.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.567
I feel sorry for Rosalee
getting pregnant right now

12:56.640 --> 12:57.971
with everything that's going on.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.007
When has there been a good time?

13:05.880 --> 13:06.881
How are you feeling?

13:08.040 --> 13:09.405
Different

13:11.160 --> 13:13.481
and the same, like...

13:14.920 --> 13:17.844
Like there's two of me.
It's very confusing.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.650
Well, a lot is.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.521
Nick, I'm gonna need you
to give me that cloth.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.921
I wanna take it to Rosalee.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.201
Why?

13:30.160 --> 13:31.536
After everything
that happened to us,

13:31.560 --> 13:33.801
we need to know what it is
and where it came from.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.609
The answer might be
on the cloth.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.129
I'm not sure that it is.

13:45.240 --> 13:48.881
We need to find out where its power
comes from before it kills one of us.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.571
Watch it.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.136
I didn't see anybody.
Did you see anybody?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.321
No.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.640
Doesn't mean they're not there.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.971
Boy, oh, boy, I'm gonna
need a lot of glue.

14:16.240 --> 14:21.121
So should we just open up shop,
act like nothing's wrong?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.009
Or keep it closed and act
like we're paranoid?

14:23.080 --> 14:24.080
Well, aren't we?

14:24.120 --> 14:26.248
I don't know. I'm trying
very hard not to be.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.656
I don't want our baby to be born
full of tension, thank you.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.444
No, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

14:31.160 --> 14:36.530
Okay, we'll just open up shop
like it's any normal day.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.761
Spice & Tea.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.444
Hey, it's Ada/ind.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.045
Got a minute?
I kind of need a favor.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.531
Sure, what?

14:50.960 --> 14:53.361
Can I bring the kids by the
shop for a couple of hours?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.170
There's something I have to do,

14:55.680 --> 14:57.842
and I don't trust
my kids with anybody else,

14:58.280 --> 15:00.408
except for Nick, but I
don't know where he is,

15:00.480 --> 15:02.608
and I'm just too afraid
to contact him.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.841
Yes, bring them over.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.410
Great, thank you.
We'll be there soon.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.561
Okay-

15:06.640 --> 15:08.290
"Bring them over"? Who's "them"?

15:08.920 --> 15:11.048
Kelly and Diana. Adalind
wants us to watch them.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.201
Whoa, wait a minute. Diana?

15:12.280 --> 15:14.726
You mean the one who, like,
beamed herself into Nick's loft?

15:14.800 --> 15:15.976
You sure that's
such a good idea?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.496
If Adalind didn't think
it was a good idea,

15:17.520 --> 15:18.536
she wouldn't bring them over.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.561
They're her children.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.244
Okay, fine, whatever you say.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.609
But if Diana, like, disappears,
we can't be held accountable.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.691
That's all I'm saying.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.810
Yeah, hello?
It's me. We have a problem.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.166
Where are you?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.402
In jail. I've been
arrested for murder.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.046
What?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.531
They have evidence.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.446
It puts me at the scene.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.806
So you knew the victim?

16:25.920 --> 16:27.160
Yeah.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.924
That complicates it.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.480
I know. Now, un-complicate it.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.049
Nick, we need answers.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.685
This isn't a good idea.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.525
You went all the way to Germany

17:51.600 --> 17:52.681
to find this thing.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.283
What's stopping you now?

17:55.360 --> 17:56.646
I'm not sure.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.120
Nick, we've got to find out
what's going on with this.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.122
I saw this one,
this one, and this one.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.451
I can't see what you're seeing.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.851
Yeah, I couldn't see it either.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.970
I didn't seen them until I touched
the body in the Spice Shop.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.611
That was fun. Didn't think
she was coming back.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.761
A dead guy touched you.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.286
How is that possible
if he's, you know, dead?

18:28.520 --> 18:29.601
Death Grip.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.284
That's what Rosalee
called it anyway.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.696
"Death Grip"
does not sound good.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.846
How did you get out of it?

18:33.920 --> 18:36.161
Rosalee cut the
dead guy's arm off.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.046
Oh, well, yeah,
I guess that could do it.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.850
You have to be very
careful with that.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.691
I will be.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.250
You need to be careful, too.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.096
I don't think you
should be carrying

18:48.120 --> 18:49.320
the stick around all the time.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.211
It's the only reason I'm alive.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.804
Yeah, it's powerful,

18:58.880 --> 19:00.882
but we don't know where
that power comes from.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.016
I don't think that matters.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.041
It does matter.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.496
Look what happened
when those guys tried

19:04.520 --> 19:05.656
to take the stick away from you.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.206
It acted defensively, like
it was connected to you.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.000
That's different from
what it did to Monroe,

19:10.040 --> 19:11.804
or me, or you when
you were shot.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.526
Nick, maybe she's right.
You know, maybe...

19:14.600 --> 19:19.447
Look, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for this stick,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.004
so I think I should be the one

19:24.080 --> 19:26.651
who decides when not to use it.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.096
Well, there's no risk
for you down here,

19:30.120 --> 19:31.531
so I don't see how it would hurt

19:31.600 --> 19:32.840
to put it away for a while,

19:33.560 --> 19:34.891
if you can.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.131
Happy?

19:54.680 --> 19:56.125
We should get going.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.320
You were shot?

20:08.960 --> 20:10.769
Shouldn't we have some
games or something?

20:10.840 --> 20:13.127
You know what? I'm gonna
go out and get some toys.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.736
It's gonna be fine.
You don't know that.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.048
Diana is the offspring of a full-on
Hexenbiest and a half Zauberbiest,

20:18.120 --> 20:20.885
and Kelly is the son of the
same Hexenbiest and a Grimm.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.566
I'm sorry, but that is
a big, weird gene pool

20:23.640 --> 20:25.369
to just be diving into.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.851
Oh. Hi! Hello!

20:26.920 --> 20:28.206
Hi!

20:28.280 --> 20:29.964
Thanks so much
for helping us out.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.241
Of course.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.721
Hi, Diana. I'm glad we finally
get a chance to meet.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.802
I'm Rosalee, and this is Monroe.
Hi.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.571
I know. I saw both of you
with Kelly's daddy.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.802
That's right. That was pretty
impressive what you did,

20:40.880 --> 20:42.882
just appearing like that
out of the blue.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.481
Why?

20:46.680 --> 20:50.810
Oh. Um, just 'cause most people
can't really do that sort of thing.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.930
What is all this stuff?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.162
Just a bunch of
herbs and spices.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.976
Kelly's still asleep.
Do you mind

21:01.000 --> 21:02.096
if I just put him
in the back room?

21:02.120 --> 21:04.646
Sure. Let's find a cozy spot.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.165
So...

21:06.240 --> 21:08.004
Okay, um...

21:10.320 --> 21:12.846
You wanna see some of the
herbs and spices? Uh-huh.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
Hey, you like cinnamon?

21:14.080 --> 21:15.536
We got some cinnamon
sticks right over here.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.050
You know where
cinnamon comes from?

21:17.120 --> 21:18.804
Do you? Actually, I do.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.241
Uh, it comes from the inner
bark of several trees

21:21.320 --> 21:22.810
of the genus Cinnamomum.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.724
Now, this bark contains certain
oils that provide the...

21:39.200 --> 21:41.168
Thank you so much
for doing this.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.803
I can't even imagine
what you're going through,

21:43.880 --> 21:45.962
considering what's going on.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.883
Sean's been arrested.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.682
What? Yeah, for murder.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.929
I'm surprised.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.216
Not that he murdered somebody,

21:55.240 --> 21:56.520
but that he was arrested for it.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.561
Was it Bonaparte?

21:57.720 --> 21:59.210
No, Rachel Wood.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.045
He killed his own mistress?

22:01.920 --> 22:05.561
It's complicated, but he wants
me to get him out of it.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.005
How? I don't know.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.401
But I'll be back
as soon as I can.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.724
Okay.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.008
You are so lucky
Nick is your dad.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.684
You okay? What?

22:28.360 --> 22:31.125
It seems like you're,
you know, a little antsy.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.736
Not that you shouldn't be antsy
with all that's been going on.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.364
Uh, God knows I'm antsy.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.165
They were wrong.
Who? Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:39.240 --> 22:40.936
Nick, Nick, Nick! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.371
It should be with me.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.566
Nick, Nick, Nick,

22:43.640 --> 22:45.165
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.296
You know, it's not just me.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.290
Remember what
everybody was saying?

22:51.480 --> 22:54.051
Look, look, look. Nick,
I just think, you know,

22:54.120 --> 22:57.806
just too much of a good thing
is not a good thing.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.887
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.840
You know, I think you did
the right thing there.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.124
We've got to move. Yeah.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.891
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.566
I hope my baby is
as cute as you are.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.801
Yeah.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.720
I, uh...

23:23.400 --> 23:25.846
A little help out here maybe?
With Diana?

23:26.440 --> 23:27.441
What's wrong?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.404
I think you just...

23:29.480 --> 23:31.244
I think you need to see it.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.526
Okay.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.801
Oh.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.645
Do you like it?

23:57.400 --> 24:00.370
Oh, yeah, it's... It's so...

24:00.440 --> 24:02.761
It's so beautiful, but, um,

24:04.360 --> 24:06.601
you need to be very careful
with these things.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.125
They can all break.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.850
I know. Look.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.407
Oh!

24:11.480 --> 24:12.527
Wanna see another one?

24:12.600 --> 24:14.728
No, no, no. That was plenty.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.165
That's... That's great.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.644
I think we should
put them all back now.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.484
I can help you, if you want.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.324
No, I can do it.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.885
Are you sure?

24:35.240 --> 24:36.685
So what do you wanna do now?

24:37.200 --> 24:39.680
Uh...

24:41.360 --> 24:42.486
Adalind's here?

24:42.560 --> 24:45.006
No, she just needed
someone to watch the kids.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.084
I know you. You're
a friend of Kelly's daddy.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.243
Yeah, lam.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.566
And I know you. You're Diana.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.401
I know you, too.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.806
You're different now.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.401
Yes.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.881
Everything okay?

25:03.360 --> 25:05.249
We need to find out
more about this.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.521
Yes.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.364
Okay, let's do that.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.922
Are you... You're just...

25:13.440 --> 25:15.488
leaving me up here...

25:15.560 --> 25:16.721
all alone?

25:17.280 --> 25:19.601
You're not alone. I'm here.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.124
What do you want me to do now?

25:27.760 --> 25:29.649
Never thought I'd see this.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.050
Well, enjoy it while you can.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.360
What do you want from me?

25:33.440 --> 25:34.601
A little help.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.444
And what kind of help
would that be?

25:36.760 --> 25:38.176
Well, ironically,
I don't have an alibi

25:38.200 --> 25:39.531
for the night Rachel was killed.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.483
Where were you?
I was killing Bonaparte.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.451
Oh, well, that is awkward.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.976
Oh, we both know
I didn't kill Rachel.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.206
What do you want me to do,

25:46.280 --> 25:47.776
turn in our daughter
so you can get out of this?

25:47.800 --> 25:49.404
No, you're gonna
get me out of this.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.845
How?

25:50.920 --> 25:52.206
You're gonna be my alibi.

25:52.840 --> 25:53.920
We were together all night.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.724
I never left the house.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.724
You expect me to be your alibi
for a murder you didn't commit

25:58.800 --> 26:02.088
because you were actually murdering
the person who was your alibi?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.086
Basically, yeah.

26:04.880 --> 26:05.881
Shouldn't be too hard.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.410
Unless I perjure myself,
and I end up going to jail.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.527
Let me tell you something.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.090
I have two kids to take care of.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.401
I'm not going to jail for a
murder I did not commit!

26:14.480 --> 26:15.656
Why not?
You're not going to jail

26:15.680 --> 26:16.761
for one you did commit.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.410
You owe me.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.482
I owe my children.

26:20.560 --> 26:21.800
And if I have to choose between

26:21.840 --> 26:23.968
me going to jail
and you going to jail,

26:24.040 --> 26:25.565
good luck with the grand jury.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.441
Thank God, it's you guys.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.096
You never know what you're
gonna meet down here.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.531
You okay? Yeah.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.166
Thanks for what you did.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.606
We tried to stop Renard.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.016
How the hell did you get out of there?
It was unbelievable!

27:09.040 --> 27:10.280
It was that stick thing!

27:10.360 --> 27:12.567
Talk about talking softly
and carrying a big stick.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.856
They tried to take it from him,

27:13.880 --> 27:16.167
and it was like they got hit
with a bolt of lightning!

27:16.480 --> 27:19.006
Seriously? Something like that.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.256
What did you charge Renard with?

27:20.280 --> 27:21.486
The murder of Rachel Wood.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.766
Her body was found on her bed,

27:22.840 --> 27:24.296
wrapped in a sheet,
smothered to death.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.096
Renard's fingerprints
were all over the place.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.776
And did he do it? HANK:
Well, he says he didn't,

27:27.800 --> 27:29.376
but we've got enough to
take it to grand jury.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.376
I think we got enough to take
this son of a bitch down.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.401
But I'm still on the run.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.336
Well, at least we got him
off your back for a while.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.486
It's not good enough.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.761
We need to get him to drop
the charges against me.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.604
Good idea,
but how you gonna do that?

27:40.720 --> 27:42.449
That guy is a dick.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.284
We don't bring him down.
We let him go.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.536
What the hell
are you talking about?

27:47.560 --> 27:50.040
Renard doesn't wanna go to
jail any more than I do.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.326
So we need to talk.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.576
You think you can
trust him, Nick?

27:52.600 --> 27:55.206
No, but I trust
his need to destroy me.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.441
Is there anything I can do?

27:57.520 --> 27:59.443
No, you've done enough.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.045
Why don't you just go back home?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.684
But if you need me,
I'm willing to spend

28:04.760 --> 28:06.376
the rest of my life
down here in this tunnel,

28:06.400 --> 28:07.401
if that's what it takes.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.811
Uh, what about your wife?

28:09.680 --> 28:10.806
Oh.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.248
Yeah, yeah, she probably wouldn't
like living down here that much,

28:14.320 --> 28:15.560
but the kids sure would.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.807
Be advised, APB is
still out on Detective Burkhardt-

28:20.920 --> 28:22.888
He is to be considered armed and
dangerous-

28:22.960 --> 28:24.769
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.081
Oh, hey, where are you?
Wait. Uh, don't tell me.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.685
I need your help with something.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.211
Where are you?

28:30.280 --> 28:32.567
Uh, actually,
I'm in your precinct.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.641
Can you talk?

28:33.720 --> 28:35.051
Uh, I think so.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.567
I need to make a deal with
somebody who I don't trust.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.971
Oh, you need a Trust Me Knot.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.123
It's not a "not" not. It's a knot
with a like you tie with a rope?

28:43.560 --> 28:44.561
And how does that work?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.210
It's pretty simple, actually.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.376
Whoever signs the Trust Me Knot

28:47.400 --> 28:48.456
has to do what they promise,

28:48.480 --> 28:51.927
or they choke to death like a
hangman's knot around their neck.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.530
I can do one for you.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.601
Can you do it now?

28:55.320 --> 28:57.561
Uh... Yeah.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.244
Let me just grab
a couple of things,

28:59.320 --> 29:00.651
and where should I meet you?

29:03.320 --> 29:05.209
Where you first told me
you loved me.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.041
Okay-

29:14.680 --> 29:15.886
NOW what?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.371
Somebody doesn't think you belong here.
Let's go.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.041
Where?

29:23.640 --> 29:24.656
You're looking for Burkhardt.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.761
He's looking for you.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.136
I assume you have
the proper paperwork

29:30.160 --> 29:31.321
for transferring a prisoner?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.447
Probably not.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.090
Don't worry. We're
not gonna kill you.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.771
Turn around.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.800
Guard!

30:00.880 --> 30:02.166
Hell of a déjà vu.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.321
Glad you could make it.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.562
Well, I can't pass up
such an invitation.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.368
Just so you know, if I
wind up missing or dead,

30:09.440 --> 30:10.680
you're suspect number one.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.685
You're no good to me dead.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.360
I tried to convince him
otherwise, but...

30:14.400 --> 30:16.360
We have enough evidence
to convince the grand jury

30:16.400 --> 30:18.402
to put you on trial
for her murder.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.925
I did not kill Rachel Wood.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.576
Your fingerprints were
at the crime scene,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.409
and you have no alibi
for that night.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.929
He has an alibi. Me.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.522
I know where he was
and what he was doing.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.291
But if I testify that you were
killing Bonaparte at the time,

30:37.360 --> 30:40.045
that might complicate both
of our lives even more.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.645
But that's not why we're here.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.250
We're here to help you.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.850
And how do you suggest
we do that?

30:46.280 --> 30:48.567
You drop all of the charges
against me.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.847
And reinstate him
into the department.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.003
And we give you an alibi that'll work
for the night Rachel was killed.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.840
You have an alibi in mind?

30:56.720 --> 30:58.006
Adalind.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.641
Little late for that.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.529
Already tried.
She turned me down.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.291
She didn't turn me down.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.084
Well, she'll have to testify.

31:08.840 --> 31:09.921
She Will.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.240
Look, even if she does,

31:12.280 --> 31:13.440
and I don't believe she will,

31:14.120 --> 31:15.724
I'm not dropping the
charges against you

31:15.800 --> 31:17.370
until I'm cleared
by a grand jury.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.887
And Adalind won't be testifying
until we have a guarantee

31:20.960 --> 31:22.849
that you will drop the
charges against me.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.484
So how do we get around this
little mutual distrust of ours?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.005
A Trust Me Knot.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.331
You really get around,
don't you?

31:32.680 --> 31:35.251
Take his cuffs off. He's gonna
need his hands for this.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.243
You know how this works?

31:39.320 --> 31:40.367
Sort of.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.080
Take it.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.691
This is a blood oath. Whoever
breaks it first will die.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.729
You, Nick Burkhardt,

32:00.800 --> 32:04.407
agree that I will testify at the
grand jury on Sean Renard's behalf.

32:04.480 --> 32:08.610
And, you, Sean Renard, agree
that once my testimony is given,

32:08.680 --> 32:12.048
you will drop all charges against
Nick Burkhardt and reinstate him.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.561
Agreed?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.326
Agreed.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.281
Agreed?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.406
Agreed.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.048
If the trust is broken,

32:53.120 --> 32:54.121
the knot will kill.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.321
Oh.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.888
Don't wanna be breaking that.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.402
Maybe you should
just try it on the corner.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.848
In case something happens,
we don't destroy it.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.336
Why don't we try it on a
different piece of cloth first?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.771
Yeah, probably a good idea.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.250
So far, so good.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.890
Sorry that took me so long.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.962
No problem. He was an angel.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.166
What did Renard want?

33:31.240 --> 33:32.765
For me to be his alibi.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.921
What did you tell him?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.411
That I wouldn't do it.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.164
I bet that went over well.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.163
Well, we sort of made a deal.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.851
A deal with Renard? About what?

33:41.920 --> 33:44.082
Nick. He's on his way over.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.370
They're still looking for him.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.886
He knows. He's taking
the long way around.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.491
This looks really old.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.721
What are you trying to do?

33:52.320 --> 33:54.256
It's an ancient cloth
that has some writing on it,

33:54.280 --> 33:55.296
and we're trying to read it.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.810
Without destroying it.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.564
We used a spectral
imaging machine,

33:58.680 --> 34:00.330
but we could only make
out a few letters.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.482
Yeah, one of the words
is "miracle,"

34:02.600 --> 34:05.251
and the other is, like,
"dangerous" or "perilous."

34:05.800 --> 34:06.881
What are you using?

34:06.960 --> 34:08.166
Well, since it's so old,

34:08.239 --> 34:10.775
we're starting with a mix of
phenolphthalein and red cabbage water.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.210
If the ink is ammonia-based...

34:12.320 --> 34:14.561
It'll turn pink
and become more legible.

34:14.639 --> 34:15.971
That's the theory.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.321
Hmm. Maybe it's not enough?

34:25.880 --> 34:27.643
Wait. Something's happening.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.091
Okay, clearly not ammonia-based.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.601
Mommy, I thought
we were going to go.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.005
We are. Just one second.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.083
Not that we wouldn't be happy
to have you a little longer.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.161
What are you doing?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.846
I'm just trying to help Rosalee
and Eve see something.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.804
See something where?

34:49.880 --> 34:51.484
On this really
old piece of cloth.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.176
It has some writing on it, and we're
having a tough time seeing it.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.201
Can I try?

34:55.320 --> 34:57.846
Oh, honey, it's really old,
and we should get going.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.521
I can see it.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.646
What can you see?

35:10.240 --> 35:11.685
Lots of stuff.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.045
Can you tell us what you see?

35:36.120 --> 35:38.088
Little pictures
and some strange writing.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.800
How many little pictures?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.041
All over it.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.724
You can see more than
just what's here?

35:42.920 --> 35:44.285
Uh-huh.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.969
Nick. You okay?

35:48.080 --> 35:50.651
Yeah, just wanted to make
sure I wasn't being followed.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.768
Nick, Diana can see
something on the cloth.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.208
What? Strange drawings
and pictures.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.568
You're the one my mom
wanted me to talk to.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.682
Thank you for helping us.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.125
You're Kelly's daddy.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.086
I am.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.045
And you're his sister.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.406
I like him.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.205
He doesn't talk much.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.690
Can you draw what you're seeing?

36:16.400 --> 36:17.481
Sure.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.046
Here.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.961
It's HW.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.121
In Portland?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.205
Not anymore.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.126
I'm here.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.047
No, the... This isn't
a good time for me to...

36:36.320 --> 36:37.446
When?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.240
Yeah, I understand that.
It's just...

36:50.160 --> 36:53.528
Nick, I'm leaving Portland
in four hours. Where?

36:53.600 --> 36:54.656
I'll know when I get there.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.681
What about me?

36:56.800 --> 36:58.643
Didn't say anything
about you. Just Grimms.

36:58.720 --> 36:59.920
They want you to come with me.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.088
I'm sorry, you guys, but
you've got to look at this.

37:02.440 --> 37:05.569
It's like some kind of
weird, symbol-filled,

37:05.640 --> 37:08.371
equation-esque
kind of hieroglyphicy,

37:08.440 --> 37:12.081
astrological cornucopia
of something

37:12.160 --> 37:13.764
I've run out of words for.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.330
I've never seen
anything like this.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.047
Me, neither.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.645
Check it out on the computer.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.370
Hey, uh...

37:31.840 --> 37:33.968
I just had
a really awful thought.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.616
What if our evidence against
Renard is too strong,

37:36.640 --> 37:37.846
and they take it to trial?

37:37.920 --> 37:39.684
Then the deal is off,
and Nick is screwed.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.401
You're not helping.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.006
There are no witnesses, and
Adalind's alibi should clear him.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.605
Okay, she's believable, right?

37:45.680 --> 37:48.331
Well, when you're that pretty,
people wanna believe you.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.320
Griffin.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.044
What? When?

37:55.520 --> 37:57.602
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.523
Yeah, yeah. We'll be there.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.280
They're convening the grand
jury for Renard in two hours.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.169
Two hours?

38:05.240 --> 38:07.447
It takes three days to
convene a grand jury.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.896
They're making
an exception for Renard,

38:08.920 --> 38:11.241
considering he's a police
captain and a mayor-elect.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.362
Okay. We've got to call Nick.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.451
Whatever these symbols are,
I don't think they're numerical.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.601
I can't find them anywhere.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.205
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.607
I've looked at the Babylonians
and the Egyptians,

38:24.680 --> 38:26.125
and that's as far
back as arithmetic,

38:26.240 --> 38:27.526
which is about 2000 BC, so...

38:27.880 --> 38:29.296
How do we know the
right place to look

38:29.320 --> 38:30.606
if we've never seen them before?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.365
Except in hell.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.685
I've got to go.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.211
I want you to come with me.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.081
You know I can't.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.536
I know, but even if
you get out of this,

38:43.560 --> 38:45.403
Renard's still gonna be
running this city.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.527
It'll be bad.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.680
Well, someone has to
stay here and deal with it.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.444
You better be alive
when I get back.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.245
It's Hank.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.576
Hey, I thought we weren't supposed
to be using our cell phones.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.284
We've got a bigger problem.

39:15.920 --> 39:16.921
Where is Nick?

39:19.480 --> 39:20.527
Yeah, what's going on?

39:20.600 --> 39:22.170
They're convening
the grand jury now.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.605
We need Adalind
at the courthouse.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.966
What? This soon?

39:25.040 --> 39:27.407
Because of who he is,
they wanna get it over fast.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.603
Okay, I'm on my way.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.809
All of a sudden I'm nervous.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.887
Ladies and gentlemen, this
court is now in session.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.644
Please, take your seats.

39:50.960 --> 39:55.966
The grand jury in case number
75-6574 is now convened.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.641
Good afternoon, Ms. Hurtz.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.724
Good afternoon, Judge Stancroft.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.008
Captain Renard,
having thoroughly reviewed

40:05.080 --> 40:07.082
all the evidence with
the District Attorney,

40:10.600 --> 40:12.921
it is my opinion that
the evidence clearly

40:13.000 --> 40:14.889
does not support
this case going to trial.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.360
Is he serious?

40:18.440 --> 40:20.249
He's throwing
the whole thing out.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.004
I thank
the jury for your service

40:22.080 --> 40:24.242
and for convening
on such short notice.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.402
You are dismissed.
The defendant is free to go.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.970
You remember that deal
we had, right?

40:36.040 --> 40:39.249
Well, you never testified,
so the deal is off.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.046
I'll expect your resignations
on my desk in the morning.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.776
That couldn't have gone
better, I don't think.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.131
Just be a little more careful

40:56.200 --> 40:57.656
where you leave your
fingerprints next time.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.680
I will.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.776
And as soon as I take office,

40:59.800 --> 41:01.529
I'm gonna clean house
in Portland.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.210
I hope that includes the Grimm.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.566
And all his friends.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.051
Oh, it Will.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.803
So the whole deal
with Renard is off?

41:13.880 --> 41:15.696
Yeah, what about this whole
Trust Me Knot thing?

41:15.720 --> 41:17.404
Wasn't Renard
supposed to choke on that

41:17.480 --> 41:19.176
if he didn't live up
to his end of the deal?

41:19.200 --> 41:21.168
No, because I had
to testify first

41:21.240 --> 41:22.685
in order for Renard
to release him.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.161
And since she didn't testify,
the deal never happened.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.400
So that son of a bitch walks,

41:26.440 --> 41:27.805
and Nick is still a fugitive.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.365
We were set up.
It was all a show.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.726
And we resign tomorrow.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.080
What about us?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.976
You're gonna have to
move back in with him.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.968
What? No, I hate him!

41:36.040 --> 41:37.644
He's coming after me.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.240
And if you don't go back, he's
gonna be coming after both of us.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.288
Bastard got
everything he wanted.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.166
What do you need, sir?

42:11.240 --> 42:13.083
I want Burkhardt found.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.446
Yes, sir.
