Lydia: <i> Previously
on</i> teen wolf...

00:03.004 --> 00:06.171
I saw everyone, even
Derek and Ethan.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.506
All of you turned to stone.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.175
All I want is some good,
old-fashioned revenge.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.344
This wolfsbane is
going in a bullet

00:12.346 --> 00:14.013
for Scott McCall.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.681
They're coming, Monroe and more.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.616
<i> And they have heavy firepower.</i>

(Knock on door)

01:04.230 --> 01:05.330
Let's go.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.520
Scott: <i> I'm gonna tell you a story.
Maybe it'll sound familiar.</i>

01:28.522 --> 01:29.788
(Thunder rumbling)

01:29.790 --> 01:32.091
<i> There was this kid.</i>

01:32.093 --> 01:35.994
<i> Sixteen, alone, and
running for his life.</i>

01:38.131 --> 01:41.033
<i> He couldn't see them, but he
could hear them getting closer.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:47.873
<i> They had guns, crossbows.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:52.311
<i> They were hunting him.</i>

01:52.313 --> 01:53.378
(Clangs)

02:22.976 --> 02:25.410
Scott: <i> It started on the
night of a full moon.</i>

02:26.646 --> 02:28.046
<i> Something came at him.</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:30.315
<i> Something bit him.</i>

02:31.818 --> 02:34.086
<i> And it changed his life.</i>
(Panting)

02:34.988 --> 02:36.989
<i> It changed everything.</i>

02:36.991 --> 02:38.924
(Growling) (Blows landing)

03:08.354 --> 03:09.922
(Panting)

03:23.703 --> 03:24.870
(Screaming)

03:27.807 --> 03:29.808
What's your name? Alec.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.277
Did I get it right, Alec?

03:34.414 --> 03:36.048
Is that what happened to you?

03:39.485 --> 03:41.153
I've got my own story.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.791
But there were parts
that I didn't expect.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.960
People...

03:49.896 --> 03:52.297
That I thought that would
be with me forever...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.500
Were the ones that I lost.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.574
Some people I thought i
could never trust...

04:04.944 --> 04:06.678
Ended up saving my life.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.815
More than once.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.491
We've all got stories.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.160
Everyone in my story is dead.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.831
Yeah, but you're not.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.501
And now you're with us.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.870
So what happens next?

04:33.706 --> 04:36.508
Your story. How does it end?

05:16.516 --> 05:17.582
Malia!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.384
(Guns firing)

05:25.158 --> 05:26.558
(Tires screeching)

05:30.096 --> 05:32.364
Didn't think you're doing
this without me, did you?

05:32.366 --> 05:33.432
Without us?

05:34.367 --> 05:35.667
(Growling)

05:43.843 --> 05:45.911
(Music playing)

06:19.879 --> 06:20.979

06:31.724 --> 06:32.791
(Grunts)

06:37.430 --> 06:38.630
(Grunts)

06:43.403 --> 06:44.469
(Growls)

06:51.677 --> 06:53.512
(Tires screeching)

06:57.417 --> 06:59.351
Can't believe you didn't
tell me about any of this.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.919
Not a word. Not a single word.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.989
We had reasons.
Really good reasons.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.431
Gerard...

07:13.433 --> 07:16.668
(Stammering) What
he fears most...

07:18.971 --> 07:22.007
He can't beat you.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.613
And he knows it.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.957
(Cries)

07:43.796 --> 07:45.630
It's really started, hasn't it?

07:45.632 --> 07:46.865
What's started?

07:49.569 --> 07:52.037
(Pants) It's an all-out war.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.746
(Sighs)

08:01.748 --> 08:05.016
As much as I enjoy the
impromptu family reunion,

08:05.018 --> 08:06.685
what are you doing here?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.987
I found a pack
slaughtered in Brazil.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.157
There were two words written in
blood on a wall. "Beacon hills."

08:14.660 --> 08:16.328
You came back for beacon hills?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.263
No. Came back for you.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.766
(Radio static)

08:21.768 --> 08:24.169
Gerard: (Over radio)
<i> "Blood and destruction.</i>

08:24.171 --> 08:27.172
<i> "Dreadful objects so familiar.</i>

08:27.174 --> 08:31.209
<i> "All pity choked with
custom of fell deeds.</i>

08:31.211 --> 08:34.212
<i> "Caesar's spirit,
ranging for revenge.</i>

08:34.214 --> 08:38.517
<i> "With ate by his side
come hot from hell.</i>

08:38.519 --> 08:42.187
<i> "Shall in these confines
with a monarch's voice."</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:43.688
(Static)

08:45.191 --> 08:47.392
Do you know the rest, Scott?

08:47.394 --> 08:48.927
<i> Do you know your Shakespeare?</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:54.866
"Cry, 'havoc!' And let
slip the dogs of war."

08:54.868 --> 08:57.135
Gerard: <i> War, indeed.</i>

08:57.137 --> 08:58.570
<i> Welcome back, Derek.</i>

08:58.572 --> 09:01.706
<i> You must all be feeling
rather nostalgic.</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:04.576
<i> Are you pleased with the
little family reunion</i>

09:04.578 --> 09:06.878
<i> I've gathered
around you, Scott?</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:10.415
Yeah, well, why don't you come join
us and I can thank you in person?

09:10.417 --> 09:15.220
<i> I even have a few
visitors for you,</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:17.055
<i> from London.</i>

09:17.057 --> 09:22.394
Even someone like
Jackson whittemore

09:22.396 --> 09:26.765
<i> couldn't resist coming
back to beacon hills.</i>

09:26.767 --> 09:28.233
<i> Say hello, Jackson.</i>

09:28.235 --> 09:30.135
(Screaming)
(Electricity crackling)

09:35.741 --> 09:38.410
Do it again, old man.
Come a little closer.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.745
I'm gonna shove that thing
so far up your ass...

09:40.747 --> 09:44.115
Lost none of his charm, has he?

09:44.117 --> 09:47.586
You can find him here with
us at the armory, Scott.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.422
In fact,

09:50.424 --> 09:54.492
I'm going to tell you where
to find all of them.

09:56.862 --> 10:00.432
<i> Your deputy hellhound met some
friends of his while responding</i>

10:00.434 --> 10:02.367
<i> to a call at eichen house.</i>

10:06.872 --> 10:09.374
<i> Your father was on his way
back from San Francisco</i>

10:09.376 --> 10:11.843
<i> with the goal of
entering the fight.</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:14.279
<i> But he didn't get far.</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:19.951
<i> You might want to tell your mother to
skip her shift at the hospital tonight.</i>

10:19.953 --> 10:22.454
<i> Liam and his friends
are there now.</i>

10:22.456 --> 10:26.458
<i> Optimistic of them, but
woefully ill-advised.</i>

10:27.960 --> 10:30.629
<i> This is how you
wage war, Scott.</i>

10:30.631 --> 10:35.066
<i> A strategic positioning of
your army against theirs.</i>

10:35.068 --> 10:38.637
Which is why you
will come to me.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.973
You will try to save
as many as you can.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.144
And you might even save a few.

10:46.146 --> 10:50.215
But your limited resources
will be spread thin.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.218
<i> Ultimately you will fail.</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:59.924
<i> The dogs of war, Scott.
They're coming for you...</i>

10:59.926 --> 11:01.059
(Static)

11:14.507 --> 11:16.341
Scott: (Over cell phone)
<i> Just buy us more time.</i>

11:16.343 --> 11:18.510
<i> Wherever Liam and the others
are, get them out of there.</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:21.346
Am I buying you time to come
up with a plan or to get help?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.580
Scott: <i> Both.</i>

11:27.186 --> 11:28.753
(Music playing)

11:34.694 --> 11:37.028
Stiles: <i> It was, literally,
day one at my internship,</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:39.464
and up comes a slide about this
guy that they've been chasing

11:39.466 --> 11:41.299
in the woods in north Carolina.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.134
I thought you were
in south America.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.471
I was. The bodies of the werewolves
I told you about? They blamed me.

11:46.473 --> 11:51.042
So I learn that the FBI has cornered
this feral mass-murdering unsub...

11:51.044 --> 11:53.411
I found a group of hunters
gathering in a meeting place.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.713
I was trying to get information.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.548
Well, the FBI found
out about it too

11:56.550 --> 11:59.884
and they were planning a SWAT assault
to take him down. Dead or alive.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.921
And, as we all know, though, with
Derek, it's preferably dead.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.189
Preferably.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.558
So I convinced them to
take me on the field op.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.560
You convinced the FBI
to bring an intern

12:08.562 --> 12:10.829
onto an extremely dangerous
field operation?

12:10.831 --> 12:12.897
I'm surprised he didn't
convince them he could lead it.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.766
I tried. Didn't work.

12:14.768 --> 12:18.303
Anyway, long story short, i basically,
you know, had to save his life.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.140
(Gunshots) (Derek grunting)

12:28.080 --> 12:30.014
That's not how it happened.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.751
Yeah. I may have left out a detail,
but that's the gist of what happened.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.853
It was the essential
essence of it.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.920
You couldn't walk.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.522
I was limping.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.591
You couldn't walk and I know
that because i was carrying you.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.359
(Gunshots) (Screaming)

12:47.933 --> 12:49.834
They shot my toe.
You want to see it?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.705
My toe was caught in the crossfire.
It was obliterated.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.206
Okay, forget your toe.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.808
Obliterated. Lydia: Hmm.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.210
Guys, it's not just the hunters.
We've got another problem.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.345
It's called the anuk-ite.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.216
They're everywhere.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.285
My phone's not working. I think
they're using a cell jammer.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.353
So, what do we do?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.122
We can't leave without Liam.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.490
And we can't wait
around for help.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.460
Then it's just you and me.
Against them?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.228
Yeah. Why not?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.465
Is this a weird time to
say that I love you?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.634
Not if I love you too.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.136
We might die tonight.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.638
We're not dying tonight.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.239
(Music playing)

13:30.643 --> 13:31.709
Ready?

13:38.017 --> 13:39.918
(Door creaks) (Footsteps)

13:41.821 --> 13:43.221
(Lights flickering)

13:48.260 --> 13:49.494
(Sniffs)

13:51.931 --> 13:53.064
You all right?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.734
(Stammers) I think so.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.005
Who knocked you out?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.174
One of my friends?
Or one of yours?

14:03.176 --> 14:06.077
I'm not sure I have any
friends right now.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.580
I'm not sure I blame them.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.718
You okay to stand?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.119
We're gonna need your help.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.789
With what?

14:17.791 --> 14:19.924
Taking back the hospital.
(Crackles)

14:22.862 --> 14:26.297
This is all the yellow
wolfsbane we could find.

14:26.299 --> 14:30.301
Extremely rare, but enough
to make one bullet.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.137
And more than powerful
enough to kill an Alpha.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.208
It can get into your head.
It can make you see things.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.144
What does it look like? It used
to look like two ordinary people.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.247
But somehow they merged.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.082
All we know is that
it's made of two faces.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.885
One human. The other
supernatural.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.586
And it's a shapeshifter,
just like us.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.089
But it knows what you're afraid of.
What you fear most.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.891
And now it can kill you
just by looking at you.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.728
Okay, so you're telling me we gotta
go up against this thing blind?

14:56.730 --> 14:58.997
And face our deepest fear?

14:58.999 --> 15:01.432
Yeah. Why? What do
you fear the most?

15:01.434 --> 15:02.567
Blindness.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.735
Becoming blind?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.905
Yeah, terrified of it.
Always have been.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.241
This just seems to be a situation
of unfortunate overlap.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.244
Lydia, you and stiles need to find argent,
get to the armory, rescue Jackson.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.013
I don't think we have
time to wait for him.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.848
I've gotten through those doors
once, anyway. I can do it again.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.183
Can we slow it down just for one
second, make sure I'm grasping this?

15:19.185 --> 15:22.086
So, we're actually talking
about doing this?

15:22.088 --> 15:25.423
We're gonna do exactly what Gerard
wants us to? Is that right?

15:25.425 --> 15:28.259
I think that if we stop the
anuk-ite, we stop it all.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.929
Stopping this thing can stop
Gerard and the hunters?

15:30.931 --> 15:32.697
Not all of them are hunters.

15:32.699 --> 15:36.100
He's right. Most of them are
ordinary people acting out of fear.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.436
(Sighs) Monroe's
not gonna change.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.271
But I think that we
can reach the others.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.940
Most of them, actually.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.275
The anuk-ite is causing them
to come from a place of fear.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.145
Well, fear's pretty motivating.
Especially when it leads to anger.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.481
And I think that if we can take out the fear,
we can take out the fight in them too.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.284
They're afraid of us, but
they don't have to be.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.485
They just have to
change their minds.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.687
Well, we have to
change their minds.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.792
Okay, we can face the anuk-ite.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.795
We can try to fight it blind.
We can try to face our fears.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.296
But we still need to
know how to catch it.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.065
We will figure that out.
We always do.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.167
Oh, it is nice to see that somebody
hasn't lost their optimism.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.468
Not yet.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.136
I have.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.638
We will buy you time, Scott.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.674
Who knows? Maybe
Jackson has an answer.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.409
Maybe argent will
come back with one.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.479
You two. You're with me.
And we need Peter.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.514
Anyone who can help stop
this thing or slow it down.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.149
Where we headed?
The high school.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.551
That's where we're
gonna find this thing?

16:26.819 --> 16:27.885
No.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.321
It'll find us.

16:38.664 --> 16:42.233
Uh, two bodies?

16:43.869 --> 16:45.670
No blood. No wounds.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.904
Malia: (Over cell phone)
<i> What do they look like?</i>

16:47.439 --> 16:48.673
Statues.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.643
Greek.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.079
Malia: <i> Peter, close your eyes. Do it.
Close them now.</i> (Cell phone beeps)

16:59.618 --> 17:01.019
(Door closes)

17:01.021 --> 17:02.520
Malia: (Echoes)<i> Dad?</i>

17:33.719 --> 17:36.387
Jackson: You're afraid
of me, aren't you?

17:36.389 --> 17:39.824
Did they tell you why you
should be afraid of me?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.560
(Chuckles) If you're not afraid, why
don't you come a little closer?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.395
Shut up.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.065
It's because I'm
still part kanima.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.399
Do you know what that is?

17:50.102 --> 17:51.469
(Chuckles)

17:52.938 --> 17:54.405
Look at these claws.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.008
Come on.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.310
Come, take a look.

18:05.784 --> 18:09.087
These claws produce venom
that can paralyze you.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.359
I even have different eyes.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.662
Watch this.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.436
(Breathing heavily)

18:26.638 --> 18:29.607
I can't... I can't
change completely,

18:29.609 --> 18:33.444
but it's, it's kinda like having
a tiptronic transmission.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.713
I can switch from
automatic to manual.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.216
Do you like cars?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.817
(Chuckles)

18:39.819 --> 18:42.286
I used to drive a Porsche...

18:42.288 --> 18:44.789
(Sighs) But I can't drive
sport cars anymore. Hmm.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.225
There's no room for my tail.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.194
(Grunting)

19:05.144 --> 19:06.544
He's not dead.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.380
He can't be.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.218
There's a heartbeat,
but it's faint.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.355
We're not alone.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.756
(Footsteps approaching)

19:30.669 --> 19:31.769
Scott?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.906
I think I know how to catch it.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.683
(Breathing heavily)
(Footsteps approaching)

19:53.358 --> 19:54.458
(Loud thud)

19:54.460 --> 19:55.760
(Banging on door)

20:01.800 --> 20:03.201
Jackson? Stiles?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.535
Jackson?

20:06.371 --> 20:07.872
Already covered that.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.473
Oh, my god, it's you.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.542
It's really you. (Laughing)

20:11.544 --> 20:13.978
Lydia: I can't believe it's you.
Okay. That's nice.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.147
(Both panting) Stiles:
Okay, not too close.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.149
Watch the, uh... Watch the hands.
Okay.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.086
Okay, all right, let's
just break that up.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.321
(Both panting)

20:28.260 --> 20:29.393
You did that?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.064
Yeah, I did that.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.834
I kicked down the door.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.604
Now that we've all contributed, wanna
get the hell out of here? Huh?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.072
Uh, not without Ethan.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.242
Ethan? What's Ethan doing here?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.477
He's with me. He's with you?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.246
Yes. Me.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.347
Ethan?

20:49.349 --> 20:50.681
Yes. Ethan.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.916
And you?

20:52.284 --> 20:53.351
Ethan?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.486
Yeah.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.092
Oh, my god.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.930
I thought you'd never
figure it out.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.298
(Scoffs)

21:07.300 --> 21:08.666
(Chuckles softly)

21:10.102 --> 21:11.435
(Stutters) Can we
go find him now?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.838
(Cell phone buzzing) Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.208
Yeah? Scott: (On cell phone)
<i> You still at the armory?</i>

21:17.210 --> 21:18.943
We are. Leaving
momentarily, though.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.544
<i> There's something I
need you to get first.</i>

21:38.797 --> 21:40.197
(Sighs)

21:54.646 --> 21:55.880
(Gunshots)

21:59.251 --> 22:00.818
(Gun cocks)

22:00.820 --> 22:03.154
Wait. Let me do it.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.825
Go ahead, Liam. Run. It'll
be more fun that way.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.928
(Elevator bell dings)

22:10.930 --> 22:11.996
(Grunts)

22:18.337 --> 22:20.905
What are you doing here? Was just
asking myself the same thing.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.677
We can't just hide.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.346
Peter's not gonna
last like that.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.348
Oh, neither will we if
that thing finds us too.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.083
We've got to wait for stiles.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.085
I'm not waiting here.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.123
Whoa, hey. Malia, hold on.

22:42.961 --> 22:44.095
(Grunting)

22:45.697 --> 22:47.064
Scott... Nah, I'm okay.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.132
I'm okay. Don't let her go.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.135
(Growls)

22:55.374 --> 22:57.641
(Grunting loudly)

22:57.643 --> 23:00.311
No, you're not okay. It's yellow wolfsbane.
It's gonna kill you.

23:01.646 --> 23:02.780
What?

23:19.765 --> 23:21.065
(Grunts)

23:21.067 --> 23:22.133
(Metal clangs)

23:23.769 --> 23:25.269
(Both pant)

23:25.271 --> 23:26.737
Corey: You okay?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.506
Yeah.

23:28.508 --> 23:32.343
Except, I think that this
bedpan was still being used.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.813
(Panting)

23:37.783 --> 23:39.016
(Both panting)

23:40.619 --> 23:42.453
How did you get out before me?

23:42.455 --> 23:44.088
Well, I talked my way out of it.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.090
You used the tail, didn't you?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.425
You still have a tail?

23:47.427 --> 23:48.426
So gross.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.527
Can you just get up?

23:50.095 --> 23:51.328
Let's go.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.832
Still out there?

23:57.369 --> 23:58.602
Look, I'm not dying for you.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.271
I'm not dying for you either.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.675
(Clicks tongue)

24:05.544 --> 24:08.512
But I will fight with you.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.616
(Sighs) Okay.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.153
Let's fight.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.788
(Elevator bell dings)

24:17.790 --> 24:18.856
(Both snarling)

24:23.895 --> 24:25.196
(Grunting)

24:36.641 --> 24:37.908
(Clattering)

24:43.315 --> 24:44.381
(Man groans)

24:50.155 --> 24:51.255
Get down!

25:04.503 --> 25:06.704
(Both panting)

25:06.706 --> 25:08.439
Come on. Okay, sit down.
Sit down.

25:08.441 --> 25:10.040
Derek, just go.
Help Malia, please.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.843
Look, I'm not worried about her.
We gotta get rid of this.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.113
And there's only one way
to get rid of wolfsbane.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.849
You gotta burn it out. What?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.185
Okay, look, you're not gonna be
able to do much until you heal.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.287
If I'm right, we just
need stiles to get here.

25:24.723 --> 25:25.789
Okay.

25:28.226 --> 25:29.593
(Screaming)

25:32.697 --> 25:34.565
(Grunting)

25:34.567 --> 25:36.033
Okay, okay, okay. That's all right.
Okay.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.371
That's all right. That's all right.
Okay.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.158
(Growls)

26:14.739 --> 26:17.241
Remember, you can't look at it.
You have to fight it blind.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.411
How about we don't fight it? Just get our
friends and get the hell out of here?

26:20.413 --> 26:21.745
Well, works for me.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.684
(Grunting)

26:27.085 --> 26:28.185
(Groans)

26:28.187 --> 26:30.354
(Sighs) It's here.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.822
(Lydia panting)

26:36.962 --> 26:38.095
Shut your eyes.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.763
Jackson: Lydia...
Shut your eyes.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.705
Farrell: Look at him.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.440
You think he's dying?

26:49.442 --> 26:51.709
Stilinski: Not likely.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.844
It's not that easy
to kill a hellhound.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.147
You know that's what
he's called, right?

26:57.149 --> 27:00.551
I mean, if you're gonna
wander into this world,

27:00.553 --> 27:02.453
you might as well have
all the information.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.055
Nobody here wants to get hurt.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.793
Then put your gun down, deputy.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.495
You're not gonna to shoot me.

27:11.497 --> 27:14.064
We're not gonna let you take
him out of here either.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.699
I don't know about that.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.135
There's only three of you.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.871
(Chuckles) Stilinski...

27:21.806 --> 27:23.040
Sheriff.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.812
You refer to me by my
proper title, deputy.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.047
What are you, like, 60?

27:31.316 --> 27:32.549
(Grunting)

27:46.665 --> 27:47.998
(Panting)

27:53.338 --> 27:54.738
The three of you...

27:58.943 --> 28:00.678
Help deputy Parrish to his feet

28:00.680 --> 28:02.346
and get him out of there.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.415
Yes, sir.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.918
(Clears throat) Sherriff.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.697
(Breathing heavily)

28:22.967 --> 28:24.268
(Gasping)

28:36.214 --> 28:37.481
(Grunts softly)

28:44.055 --> 28:45.122
Ethan?

28:47.392 --> 28:48.959
Ethan. Ethan's voice: I'm here.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.896
Where's Lydia? I don't know.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.265
I closed my eyes and I couldn't
see which way she went.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.934
Where are you?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.669
Right in front of you.

28:58.671 --> 28:59.970
(Gasps)

29:19.924 --> 29:21.191
(Door beeps)

29:27.132 --> 29:29.466
What's the plan?
City wide disarment.

29:29.468 --> 29:33.137
Anyone with a weapon issued by
Gerard is gonna relinquish it.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.872
And we'll use force,
if necessary.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.354
Jennifer: (Echoing)
Derek, is that you?

29:55.727 --> 29:57.027
Derek?

29:58.463 --> 29:59.730
(Sighs)

30:00.832 --> 30:02.533
Derek, it's me.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.968
It's Jennifer.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.205
(Breathing heavily)

30:09.340 --> 30:11.041
Don't you wanna look at me?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.647
Are you gonna let
them kill me again?

30:16.649 --> 30:18.015
(Grunts softly)

30:18.017 --> 30:20.317
Are you gonna leave me for dead?

30:20.319 --> 30:21.585
(Muffled growl)

30:22.987 --> 30:25.689
Or are you willing to
give me another chance?

30:25.691 --> 30:27.424
(Grunts) You're not real.

30:28.426 --> 30:29.760
Don't I sound real?

30:31.496 --> 30:32.729
Can't you look at me?

30:33.097 --> 30:34.231
(Growls)

30:34.933 --> 30:36.567
Derek, look at me.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.335
Open your eyes.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.337
(Growls softly and pants)

30:40.339 --> 30:41.405
Please?

30:43.608 --> 30:45.909
Don't you wanna look
at me one more time?

30:47.946 --> 30:49.680
Don't you wanna remember me?

30:51.516 --> 30:52.749
Remember us?

30:54.552 --> 30:56.019
(Panting)

30:57.388 --> 30:58.689
Please look at me.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.257
(Continues panting)

31:05.530 --> 31:06.597
(Grunts)

31:08.032 --> 31:09.600
Look at me!

31:16.241 --> 31:17.441
(Gasps)

31:26.751 --> 31:27.885
(Scott panting)

31:33.825 --> 31:34.892
(Grunting)

31:42.000 --> 31:43.066
Come on.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.435
(Screams)

31:45.437 --> 31:46.937
Where is it?

31:46.939 --> 31:49.573
Gerard: You actually
think i would trust you

31:49.575 --> 31:53.410
with our last few ounces
of yellow wolfsbane?

31:53.412 --> 31:54.811
I'm your daughter.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.747
I'm an argent.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.515
But still one of them.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.983
So you gave it all to her?

32:01.085 --> 32:02.753
You gave it to Monroe?

32:02.755 --> 32:06.490
Oh. Yeah, but, uh, enough
for one last bullet.

32:08.359 --> 32:09.526
(Grunting)

32:12.597 --> 32:13.764
That bullet.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.032
(Continues grunting)

32:24.542 --> 32:26.276
Man: We got another one here.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.847
I don't know if he's dead.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.552
But he definitely
looks vulnerable.

32:35.554 --> 32:36.887
(Continues grunting)

32:38.823 --> 32:40.791
(Breathing heavily)

32:40.793 --> 32:42.893
It's over now, Kate.

32:42.895 --> 32:45.562
Everything fell into place.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.030
Chris: Not everything.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.138
It's time to put the guns down.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.807
What are you talking about?

32:56.809 --> 32:59.810
Scott's still alive and he
knows how to save them.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.411
All of them.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.046
(Breathing heavily)

33:07.151 --> 33:08.986
(Footsteps approaching)

33:11.489 --> 33:13.056
Nogitsune: Hiding in
the library, Scott?

33:13.925 --> 33:15.258
Hiding from me?

33:16.761 --> 33:18.996
Open your eyes, Scott.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.567
You think you can fight
me, but you can't.

33:24.268 --> 33:25.736
Your friends are gone.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.573
They saw my face and
it drove them insane.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.744
They're gone because of you.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.081
You failed them.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.922
(Distorted) You failed everyone.

33:52.296 --> 33:55.265
Especially her.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.104
(Clattering)

34:05.710 --> 34:07.277
Especially...

34:08.646 --> 34:11.882
Allison.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.283
(Scott grunts)

34:14.552 --> 34:15.619
Derek: Open your eyes.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.456
Open your eyes. (Growls)

34:20.891 --> 34:22.159
(Screams)

34:27.565 --> 34:29.299
(Scott grunts) (Lydia wailing)

34:35.440 --> 34:36.639
Nogitsune: Scott.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.511
Open them, Scott.

34:41.513 --> 34:45.315
All you have to do
is open your eyes.

34:46.918 --> 34:51.254
Your fear is different, Scott.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.525
There's power underneath.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.831
Your power.

35:05.269 --> 35:09.806
Your fear brings me freedom!

35:09.808 --> 35:13.610
I won't be trapped again.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.946
I won't be caught

35:15.948 --> 35:21.284
and caged ever again.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.287
Not ever!

35:24.289 --> 35:25.288
(Scott grunts)

35:25.290 --> 35:27.023
(Choking)

35:29.293 --> 35:32.028
Open your eyes.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.297
(Groans)

35:35.066 --> 35:37.134
Open them!

35:39.804 --> 35:41.538
I know how to fight you.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.376
And I know how to catch you.
(Grunts)

35:56.154 --> 35:58.221
(Screaming) (Growling)

36:19.844 --> 36:21.011
(Growling)

36:21.013 --> 36:22.412
(Grunting)

36:29.854 --> 36:31.855
I can't get a shot. What
do you want me to do?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.524
Monroe: <i> Just shoot him.
Shoot both of them.</i>

36:37.361 --> 36:38.795
(Both continue grunting)

37:10.394 --> 37:11.628
(Grunts)

37:12.230 --> 37:13.296
(Scott panting)

37:27.245 --> 37:28.311
(Screams)

37:29.747 --> 37:31.147
(Growls)

37:35.186 --> 37:36.486
You can't beat me.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.856
I'm not afraid of you.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.792
Not anymore.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.195
Monroe: (Over walkie-talkie) <i> One
in the head and one in the heart.</i>

37:45.197 --> 37:46.263
Copy.

37:52.870 --> 37:56.773
Even if the yellow wolfsbane was just meant
to weaken him, Scott figured it out.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.174
Like he always does.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.211
The anuk-ite.

38:01.213 --> 38:03.546
You wanted enough power so that
you could never be trapped again.

38:03.548 --> 38:06.650
You wanted the power of
a shapeshifter like me.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.953
But that comes with all of the
rules of being a shapeshifter!

38:09.955 --> 38:11.788
We have weaknesses.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.857
And we have lines
that we can't cross.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.360
Mountain ash.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.542
(Hissing)

38:44.422 --> 38:45.488
(Gasps)

38:49.327 --> 38:50.393
(Gasps)

38:50.828 --> 38:51.895
(Grunting)

39:03.007 --> 39:04.074
(Snarls)

39:06.510 --> 39:07.577
(Growls)

39:08.512 --> 39:09.579
(Man grunts)

39:10.681 --> 39:11.915
(Growls)

39:18.356 --> 39:19.589
(Grunting)

39:22.226 --> 39:23.727
Jackson.

39:23.729 --> 39:24.861
Is it over?

39:25.363 --> 39:26.696
(Gun cocks)

39:26.698 --> 39:28.031
(Screaming)

39:31.702 --> 39:33.136
(Grunting)

39:36.640 --> 39:37.974
Now it's over.

39:38.476 --> 39:39.776
(Chuckles)

39:40.978 --> 39:42.379
Good to see you, coach.

39:42.381 --> 39:43.780
You too, Jackson.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.786
(gabe grunting)

39:56.727 --> 39:57.894
(Grunts)

40:12.109 --> 40:13.576
(Coughs)

40:15.579 --> 40:17.981
It hurts. It hurts.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.519
It hurts.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.821
It hurts. (Panting)

40:41.439 --> 40:42.505
(Grunts)

40:44.442 --> 40:45.675
(Coughs)

40:46.777 --> 40:48.211
(Breathing heavily)

41:27.418 --> 41:28.885
Does it hurt anymore?

41:30.488 --> 41:31.654
No.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.257
Good.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.529
You let this happen. (Chuckles)

42:15.032 --> 42:18.268
You let this happen,
you stupid, old man.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.371
All you saw was him.

42:21.373 --> 42:23.072
He destroyed our family.

42:23.074 --> 42:27.443
Your family is right
in front of you.

42:40.558 --> 42:41.958
(Snarling)

42:46.230 --> 42:48.398
(Snarling continues)
(Gerard screaming)

42:55.506 --> 42:56.739
Drop your weapons.

42:58.442 --> 43:00.810
Parrish, drop their weapons.

43:01.345 --> 43:02.478
Yes, sir.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.266
I'm gonna need you to
teach me how to do that.

43:23.268 --> 43:27.003
Monroe: (Over walkie-talkie) <i> This is
Monroe. Someone report with a status. Now.</i>

43:27.871 --> 43:30.273
Someone respond. (Pants)

43:30.275 --> 43:31.774
Someone talk to me.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.444
<i> What's happening?</i>

43:34.446 --> 43:36.613
<i> Someone pick up the radio and
tell me what's happening.</i>

43:36.615 --> 43:37.847
You lost.

43:40.884 --> 43:42.719
(Grunts) (Walkie
talkie clatters)

43:47.958 --> 43:49.025
Scott?

43:49.960 --> 43:51.461
He's not healing?

43:51.463 --> 43:53.162
Scott, what happened
to your eyes?

43:53.164 --> 43:54.497
I had to. I'm sorry.

43:54.499 --> 43:55.798
Derek: Scott, you have to heal.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.300
If your eyes stay like
this much longer,

43:57.302 --> 43:59.636
the damage is gonna
be permanent.

43:59.638 --> 44:01.804
Come on, Scott. Concentrate.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.807
I'm trying. It's not working.
I can't focus.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.809
Hey, hey, look at me.

44:06.811 --> 44:09.312
Yes, you can. Just concentrate.

44:09.314 --> 44:10.847
I can't, I can't, i can't do it.

44:10.849 --> 44:13.416
Yes, you can. Scott,
please just look at me.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.724
Malia.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.728
Kiss him.

44:26.363 --> 44:27.697
What?

44:27.699 --> 44:28.831
Kiss him.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.074
(Music playing)

45:05.536 --> 45:06.602
(Sighs)

45:11.875 --> 45:13.543
Scott: <i> They ran that night.</i>

45:18.482 --> 45:20.149
(Music playing)

45:23.253 --> 45:26.155
<i> Gerard put guns
in people's hands.</i>

45:26.157 --> 45:29.292
<i> But a lot less than he thought
were actually willing to use them.</i>

45:36.734 --> 45:38.167
<i> More people know
our secret now.</i>

45:39.503 --> 45:41.337
<i> But more of them
are on our side.</i>

45:44.742 --> 45:45.775
Co-captains.

45:45.777 --> 45:48.511
You wanna be co-captains now?

45:48.513 --> 45:51.914
We've, uh, gotten
past our differences.

45:51.916 --> 45:54.417
That doesn't sound
very competitive.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.085
Who taught you that crap?

45:56.087 --> 45:57.153
You did.

45:59.356 --> 46:00.990
Because you're a great coach.

46:08.132 --> 46:09.499
You're right.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.968
I am a great coach.

46:11.970 --> 46:15.204
Scott: <i> And they weren't
afraid of us anymore.</i>

46:15.206 --> 46:17.607
<i> Now we have allies who
used to be enemies.</i>

46:18.375 --> 46:19.842
<i> We have protectors.</i>

46:21.278 --> 46:23.446
<i> We have friends willing
to fight for us.</i>

46:24.448 --> 46:26.182
(Music playing)

46:42.466 --> 46:46.536
Scott: <i> The rest of us have been
looking for others like you.</i>

47:01.084 --> 47:02.151
(Scott grunts)

47:07.991 --> 47:09.492
(Indistinct chatter)

47:16.867 --> 47:17.934
Okay, Alec.

47:19.436 --> 47:21.938
The people who are
hunting you...

47:21.940 --> 47:26.008
They've got a leader. Her name's Monroe.
She's got a lot of followers.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.410
Like what? Hundreds?

47:27.878 --> 47:29.412
Thousands.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.514
All over the world.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.683
So what are we doing here?

47:33.685 --> 47:36.185
Well, we're meeting up with
some people who can help us.

47:37.721 --> 47:39.589
Some of them are always with us.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.692
Others come when we need them.

47:42.694 --> 47:45.061
(Sighs) But tonight...

47:45.063 --> 47:46.596
We need everyone we can get.

48:21.398 --> 48:22.732
Alec: Are they all...

48:22.734 --> 48:23.966
Uh, different?

48:26.236 --> 48:28.905
Some of them are.

48:28.907 --> 48:31.140
Some can do things
you'd never believe.

48:32.442 --> 48:35.244
And the others might
only be human,

48:35.246 --> 48:37.847
but they make up for it
by being really smart

48:38.916 --> 48:40.449
or really good in a fight.

48:40.451 --> 48:41.517
Who are they?

48:45.923 --> 48:47.156
My friends.

48:48.926 --> 48:49.992
My pack.

48:52.296 --> 48:54.330
And you can be with
us if you want.

48:56.199 --> 48:57.934
But you're gonna have to fight.

48:58.869 --> 49:00.169
Against Monroe?

49:01.438 --> 49:03.039
And everyone that follows her.

49:03.774 --> 49:06.609
She said she'd find me.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.879
That she'd hunt me down and kill me.
She didn't care how old I was.

49:11.114 --> 49:12.715
She said I was a monster.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.851
You're not a monster.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.121
(Sighs)

49:19.123 --> 49:20.523
You're a werewolf.

49:22.459 --> 49:23.693
Like me.
