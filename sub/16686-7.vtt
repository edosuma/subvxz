00:02.470 --> 00:07.339
I'm Derek Waters, and I'm here
in D.C. to talk to you tonight

00:07.341 --> 00:09.675
about what just happened.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.811
Now, I very rarely ever
get political,

00:12.813 --> 00:15.314
but tonight I felt the need
to let you know

00:15.316 --> 00:17.649
what I think we need to change
as a country.

00:17.651 --> 00:21.487
And truly the fist thing
that's important to me is--

00:21.489 --> 00:23.122
- [whispering indistinctly]

00:23.124 --> 00:25.491
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.192
- I'm sorry.
I'm just finding this out now.

00:27.194 --> 00:31.263
both: Live from Daytona Beach,

00:31.265 --> 00:35.367
it's the "Drunk History"

each other and be very rude.

I thought they were very civil
back then.

<i>- Hello.</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:56.448

about the election of 1800.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.284
[slurps, laughs]

01:59.286 --> 02:00.586
<i>Thomas Jefferson</i>
<i>and John Adams,</i>

02:00.588 --> 02:02.821
<i>they were Founding</i>
<i>Fathers of America,</i>

02:02.823 --> 02:04.857
<i>and they were also</i>
<i>the best of friends.</i>

02:04.859 --> 02:06.592
<i>Adams was like,</i>
<i>the Constitution--</i>

02:06.594 --> 02:09.595
<i>you can kind of bend that</i>
<i>how you need to bend it.</i>

02:09.597 --> 02:10.596
<i>We can kind of work</i>
<i>with this,</i>

02:10.598 --> 02:12.431
<i>and Jefferson</i>
<i>was always like,</i>

02:12.433 --> 02:13.432
<i>Constitution is</i>
<i>the Constitution.</i>

02:13.434 --> 02:15.567
<i>You can't [bleep] with that.</i>

02:15.569 --> 02:16.401
<i>But they loved each other</i>

02:16.403 --> 02:18.203
<i>until Adams became president,</i>

02:18.205 --> 02:21.340
and immediately
they started butting heads.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.276
John Adams was like,
it's illegal to talk any [bleep]

02:24.278 --> 02:26.645
<i>about the president</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

02:26.647 --> 02:29.948
<i>and if you disagree</i>
<i>with the federal government,</i>

02:29.950 --> 02:30.816
<i>[bleep] you.</i>

02:30.818 --> 02:32.751
<i>And Jefferson was like,</i>
<i>well, this is tyranny.</i>

02:32.753 --> 02:36.188
<i>That's a violation</i>
<i>of a little something called</i>

02:36.190 --> 02:36.889
<i>freedom of speech.</i>

02:36.891 --> 02:40.459
It all really reaches its head
on the election of 1800,

02:40.461 --> 02:42.394
<i>where these</i>
<i>two lifelong friends</i>

02:42.396 --> 02:43.428
<i>were pitted against each other.</i>

02:43.430 --> 02:46.832
<i>Adams is like,</i>
<i>if you elect Thomas Jefferson,</i>

02:46.834 --> 02:48.400
<i>here's what you're gonna get.</i>

02:48.402 --> 02:49.835
<i>Murder all the time.</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:52.404
<i>Incest, your wives will lose</i>
<i>their virtue</i>

02:52.406 --> 02:55.674
<i>having sex with a lot of dudes</i>
<i>willy-nilly.</i>

02:55.676 --> 02:58.644
<i>So Jefferson starts</i>
<i>talking a lot of [bleep]</i>

02:58.646 --> 02:59.611
<i>about John Adams.</i>

02:59.613 --> 03:01.380
We're talking
about guys who, like,

03:01.382 --> 03:02.047
created this country.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.217
They were really like
a bunch of eighth graders.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.018
<i>He was like, you know what?</i>

03:06.020 --> 03:09.788
<i>Adams has prostitutes</i>
<i>shipped in from overseas</i>

03:09.790 --> 03:11.223
<i>that he bangs all the time.</i>

03:11.225 --> 03:13.292
<i>I'm just gonna--I'm just</i>
<i>gonna tell you that right now.</i>

03:13.294 --> 03:16.461
<i>I'm--I feel like I keep seeing</i>
<i>spit flying from my mouth.</i>

03:16.463 --> 03:17.729
- No, I'm feeling it.
- Am I spitting a lot?

03:17.731 --> 03:18.997
- Yeah, I'm glad
you're seeing it, yeah.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.633
- That's good.
- I'm in the splash zone.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.770
- So Jefferson
went to the newspapers.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.338
<i>He says,</i>
<i>I want to tell you this.</i>

03:26.340 --> 03:29.608
<i>John Adams</i>
<i>is a hermaphrodite.</i>

03:29.610 --> 03:32.477
<i>He's got both man and woman</i>
<i>sex organs.</i>

03:32.479 --> 03:34.680
<i>This is, like,</i>
<i>a published statement</i>

03:34.682 --> 03:35.981
<i>from Thomas Jefferson.</i>

03:35.983 --> 03:37.950
<i>Adams was like, okay, fine.</i>

03:37.952 --> 03:38.951
<i>You want to go that route?</i>

03:38.953 --> 03:40.986
That's when [bleep]
got really dirty.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.989
<i>Adams says, oh, by the way,</i>
<i>if you were thinking about</i>

03:43.991 --> 03:46.992
<i>voting for Jefferson,</i>
<i>you shouldn't</i>

03:46.994 --> 03:49.428
<i>because he's dead.</i>

03:49.430 --> 03:50.796
<i>- That's a pretty good</i>
<i>campaign.</i>

03:50.798 --> 03:51.897
<i>- It's a very good campaign.</i>

03:51.899 --> 03:53.298
<i>- Vote for me.</i>
<i>I'm alive.</i>

03:53.300 --> 03:53.865
<i>- Yeah.</i>

03:53.867 --> 03:55.033
<i>Even if you disagree</i>
<i>with everything I say,</i>

03:55.035 --> 03:56.535
<i>at the very least, I'm alive.</i>

03:56.537 --> 03:58.470
- Would you rather be
accused of having

03:58.472 --> 04:00.706
a penis and a vagina
or being dead?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.708
- I think being alive
with a penis and a vagina

04:02.710 --> 04:04.977
would be an amazing experience.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.812
And you're alive.
- [laughs]

04:06.814 --> 04:08.580
<i>- Jefferson calls</i>
<i>upon a hatchet man,</i>

04:08.582 --> 04:14.453
<i>James Callender, to publish</i>
<i>newspaper articles about Adams.</i>

04:14.455 --> 04:16.455
<i>Adams...</i>

04:16.623 --> 04:18.423
<i>What was I gonna say here?</i>

04:18.425 --> 04:20.659
<i>Oh, yeah, and he was gonna go</i>
<i>to war with the French.</i>

04:20.661 --> 04:22.461
<i>That's what was published</i>
<i>in the newspapers.</i>

04:22.463 --> 04:24.429
<i>And it's a lie.</i>
<i>It's not true at all.</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:25.297
<i>America was like,</i>

04:25.299 --> 04:26.865
<i>I don't want to go to war</i>
<i>with the French.</i>

04:26.867 --> 04:28.000
<i>That sounds terrible.</i>

04:28.002 --> 04:30.335
And they elect Jefferson
into office.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.036
<i>Jefferson wins.</i>

04:31.038 --> 04:33.505
<i>Adams is like, you want to go</i>

04:33.507 --> 04:35.674
<i>But before I leave,</i>

04:35.676 --> 04:38.543

<i>and then he's like, I hope you</i>

04:46.719 --> 04:48.353

<i>We're done</i>

<i>He's an asshole.</i>

05:27.528 --> 05:29.528

05:32.099 --> 05:35.400

<i>Johnny, I love you two guys.</i>

05:43.544 --> 05:45.777
<i>Why aren't you speaking</i>
<i>anymore?</i>

05:45.779 --> 05:48.046
<i>Why can't we all be friends</i>

05:56.957 --> 05:57.689
<i>I'm a big fan.</i>

05:57.691 --> 05:59.624
<i>I'll pop him off a letter.</i>

05:59.626 --> 06:00.492
<i>It's very general.</i>

06:00.494 --> 06:02.594

<i>It's been ten years.</i>
<i>How's life?</i>

the letters start flowing,
