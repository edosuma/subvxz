<i>♪ Happy, happy, happy, happy ♪</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:35.827
<i>♪ Sugarfoot's birthday, hey ♪</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:36.995
Yay.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.121


00:38.288 --> 00:39.122


00:39.914 --> 00:43.209
Oh, Luanne,
this is the best half-birthday ever.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.879
Wait. It's not even your real birthday?

00:45.962 --> 00:50.550
My people die young, Uncle Hank.
I got to get in all the celebrating I can.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.094
-You guys gonna love this place.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.138
-It's down-home.
Yes.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.973
Since you gentlemen came all the way

00:57.057 --> 00:58.641
from New York to discuss business,

00:58.725 --> 01:01.561
I thought you might enjoy
some authentic Texas barbecue.

01:01.644 --> 01:05.482
Yeah. We figure you come to the zoo,
you want to see the animals!

01:05.565 --> 01:09.527
Hushpuppies, double shortening biscuits,
batter fries?

01:09.611 --> 01:10.945
Not exactly health food.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.448
Yeah. Do they fry everything down here?

01:13.531 --> 01:14.783
Wait.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.952
I don't see a "no trans-fat" sticker
on this menu.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.914
Do you people actually still use
trans-fats?

01:20.997 --> 01:24.667
Most cosmopolitan cities in America
have banned those.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.294
Even Philadelphia.

01:26.377 --> 01:29.464
Yeah! I bet they still have an "operator."

01:29.547 --> 01:34.219
"Hello. I'd like to place a call
to Hillbilly 77803."

01:40.266 --> 01:41.893
<i>This is
Nancy Hicks Gribble.</i>

01:41.976 --> 01:43.770
Is Arlen too fat?

01:43.853 --> 01:46.564
Local civic leader Ted Wassonasong
thinks so.

01:46.648 --> 01:50.401
<i>And this tastefully cropped video is</i>
<i>a shocking wake-up call.</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:53.446
That is why I am bringing a bill
to the city council

01:53.530 --> 01:57.075
to ban the sale of food
cooked in trans-fat.

01:57.158 --> 02:00.620
-What?
This is outrageous! Ah!

02:00.703 --> 02:02.205
What's a trans-fat?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.749
It's what people put in food
to make it delicious.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.668
But I love delicious food.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.545
Dad, you have to stop them!

02:08.628 --> 02:14.175
Oh, I intend to. Don't worry, Bobby.
We will eat potato-chip chicken again.

02:18.513 --> 02:22.892
New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles,
Arlen.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.853
What do these cities have in common?

02:24.936 --> 02:26.604
Right now, nothing.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.481
But they could share

02:28.565 --> 02:32.110
a future free from diabetes, obesity,
and heart disease.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.070
It is just this easy.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.242
Uh. Excuse me. Hank Hill.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.035
We know who you are.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.788
The last thing Arlen needs is a food ban.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.666
Are you saying
you are for childhood obesity?

02:46.749 --> 02:48.126
No. Of course not.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.044
I'll have you know my son is obese!

02:50.253 --> 02:52.005
Calm down.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.632
I'm not saying trans-fats
are good for you.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.635
But banning them isn't gonna solve
all those problems.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.306
Tell that to that guy's poor,
pathetic fat kid!

03:01.389 --> 03:03.099
-Yeah.
-Sit down.

03:03.183 --> 03:07.520
The government should not be deciding
what we have the right to eat.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.023
Besides, all sorts of foods
can make you sick.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.233
Rare burgers, raw oysters.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.862
If you ban trans-fats,
you might as well ban that stuff too.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.238
Fantastic idea.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.824
Let's ban raw oysters
and rare burgers too.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.327
-No, no. That's not what I'm trying to--
-All in favor?

03:22.410 --> 03:23.411
Aye!

03:24.537 --> 03:25.496
Super.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.043
This food ban is asinine.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.338
I wish the government
would just ban itself!

03:33.421 --> 03:35.381
Wrap your head around that, fellows.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.009
I'm just glad the government is
keeping me safe.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.262
Now I can snack my way to a healthier me.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.266
Delicious! And no trans-fats.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.228
Bill, we've been down this road before.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.940
Sugar free!

03:52.982 --> 03:54.108
Light beer!

03:54.817 --> 03:56.486
Forty-thirty-thirty!

03:57.612 --> 04:00.073
You don't have to worry about me
anymore, Hank.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.158
The government is doing that now.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.331
Well, they did it.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.792
-They killed Sugarfoot's!
-What?

04:10.875 --> 04:13.086
Those food bans
put us right out of business!

04:13.169 --> 04:16.422
Turns out those trans-fats
were in everything we served!

04:16.506 --> 04:17.423
Even the mints!

04:17.507 --> 04:21.261
You can't close Sugarfoot's!
It's an Arlen institution!

04:21.344 --> 04:24.681
Where are we gonna celebrate our birthdays
and sports victories?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.557
I don't know what else to do.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.977
I guess I could turn it
into a salad joint.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.355
But sooner or later, someone'll use
a spinach field as a toilet,

04:32.438 --> 04:34.232
and I'll be back in the same boat!

04:34.315 --> 04:36.567
Where am I gonna go
for my biscuits, honey?

04:36.651 --> 04:38.194
And my corn fritters?

04:38.278 --> 04:42.490
I'd pay anything for one last piece
of Sugarfoot's fried chicken.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.075
Anything?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.787
This is wrong, Mr. Strickland.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.872
You're the greatest American I know.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.041
If anyone can fix this, you can.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.210
You're right, Hank.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.298
I'm gonna mull this over and see
if I can't come up with a solution.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.385
Mr. Strickland is mulling it over.

05:05.096 --> 05:05.930
What the...

05:10.184 --> 05:13.062
Hey, tight ride, Mister Strickland.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.606
I did it! I solved our problem.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.191
You bought a lunch truck?

05:17.567 --> 05:20.695
And I re-hired my crew from Sugarfoot's.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.239
Now we can sell whatever kind of food
we want.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.450
We in the illegal food business!

05:26.868 --> 05:28.703
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.830
No, it's a great idea!

05:30.913 --> 05:35.126
I'll be just like Joe Kennedy
running whiskey during prohibition!

05:36.002 --> 05:39.922
Which helped him
become the father of a president.

05:40.006 --> 05:44.302
Well, I like the sound of that.
But you could get in a lot of trouble.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.763
You said the food bans were un-American.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.724
What's more American
than breaking an unjust law?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.060
This is a fight for freedom, Old Top!

05:55.688 --> 05:58.733
I'll do it for America.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.378
Doughnuts were one of my little joys.

06:18.461 --> 06:22.548
If the government takes away puppy breath
and really good yawns,

06:22.632 --> 06:24.509
I'll have nothing left to live for.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.844
I might be late getting home from work,
Peggy.

06:26.928 --> 06:33.935
Buck has me working on a, a side project
that's not, uh, technically, legal.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.436
Go on.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.939
Well, I'm... I'm driving a lunch truck.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.609
And we're gonna sell all that stuff
that the city banned.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.444
So you'll be a criminal.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.655
And I'll be the wife of a criminal.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.449
Well, I guess, technically. But...

06:48.533 --> 06:52.787
And all the while,
we'll be living a typical suburban life.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.206
It's just like <i>The Sopranos </i>commercials!

06:55.289 --> 06:58.960
It's not like that at all.
I'm trying to change the law.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.296
Of course you are.
And good luck with that.

07:02.380 --> 07:06.134
You have a strong brow, Hank.
I don't say that enough.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.685
Just a couple minutes before we open.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.438
I think we're gonna change
a lot of minds today.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.898
Hey, Elvin.
How are those biscuits coming along?

07:22.650 --> 07:24.652
They're getting golden brown.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.362
They're just about done, Mister Buck.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.864
I give them the poke test.

07:29.115 --> 07:29.991
Hold on.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.035
Okay, everybody stop what you're doing
and gather around.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.621
Now, we're doing something important here.

07:35.705 --> 07:40.126
This truck is a lone voice crying out
that the hardworking people of Arlen

07:40.209 --> 07:42.295
should be able to eat whatever they want.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.380
Our cause is righteous.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.008
But people are gonna look
for ways to demonize us.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.343
That's why we have to do things right.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.597
We have to be cleaner
and safer than the rest.

07:53.222 --> 07:57.894
We have to refrigerate food when not
preparing it and wash our hands often.

07:57.977 --> 08:02.106
Now, let's put on our hairnets and paper
hats and go out and sell some freedom!

08:10.490 --> 08:12.533
-What can I get you, sir?
-Burger.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.993
And how would you like that cooked?

08:14.076 --> 08:15.578
I, I got a choice?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.246
Well, you do here, friend.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.707
Hey, they got all the banned food
in there!

08:19.790 --> 08:21.000
That's right.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.752
Remember to tell your friends about us.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.921
Sugarfoot's Express,

08:25.004 --> 08:28.466
the food you want at a price
that reflects the risk involved.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.092
Uh-huh.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.177
Who's next?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.687
Yeah. Can I get a burger too?

08:41.771 --> 08:43.064
Burger up, rare.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.608
Mister Hank, Mister Hank,
you best come on up here!

08:49.195 --> 08:51.197
Uh. Hello, Officer.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.908
I heard you've got some interesting food
here.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.244
Thought I'd better come down
and take a look.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.162
We're glad you did!

08:58.246 --> 09:04.502
We've got fried chicken, fried okra, and
a special side salad for our boys in blue.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.170
Mmm.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.757
Elvin! One bag of side salad
for Arlen's finest!

09:09.840 --> 09:14.637
With... How about...
A 200 island dressing?

09:14.720 --> 09:15.555
Mm-mmm.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.724
You had better make that 300 islands.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.941
Yummy.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.862
Well, how about that?
The cops are on our side.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.948
We must be making a difference.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.913
Ah. Thank God,
Sir Burger stopped using trans-fats!

09:43.416 --> 09:46.836
These fries really help me
get through my energy crashes.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.838
I've been having a lot of those lately.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.964
I can't take it!

09:50.047 --> 09:52.133
I'm dying for a raw oyster!

09:52.216 --> 09:53.342
I never liked them before.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.761
But now that they're contraband,
I must have them!

09:58.222 --> 10:00.516
Can you guys keep a secret?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.892
-You bet.
-Mostly.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.897
Buck and I have a truck
that serves all the banned food.

10:06.981 --> 10:10.234
The secret lunch truck?
Nancy's been trying to get that on camera.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.402
I got to go tell her.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.323
That's why I swore you to secrecy, Dale.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.534
They banned that food to save us!
Think about it, Hank!

10:18.618 --> 10:22.413
If the government isn't deciding what
we can and can't eat, who will, huh?

10:22.496 --> 10:23.372
Who?

10:23.998 --> 10:25.625
Mm. I need a nap.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.632
Yes?

10:32.715 --> 10:38.220
I have an anonymous tip
for Nancy Hicks Gribble.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.513
What is it, Bill?

10:43.851 --> 10:47.521
Well, I'll be damned!
I didn't even know you could fry a pickle.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.818
Ted? But the food bans were your idea.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.654
A contradiction on the surface.

10:54.737 --> 10:58.574
But unlike many, I have the discipline
to enjoy these indulgences.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.661
That's right, Hank Hill!
Ted Wassonasong better than you!

11:03.454 --> 11:05.956
Perhaps it is education, perhaps breeding.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.333
The debate rages on.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.711
Oh, no, Hank! We got company!

11:11.337 --> 11:12.296
The news.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.799
Let's bug out!

11:14.882 --> 11:17.968
You heard Mister Strickland.
This is not another drill. Let's go!

11:27.645 --> 11:29.897
-Get rid of the evidence!
-Okay, honey.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.158
Speed up!

11:44.912 --> 11:47.832
-Gun it!
-It's already yellow. We'll never make it.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.209
Well, it's either that
or toss out Little John!

11:51.627 --> 11:52.878
Do it, Hank!

11:58.217 --> 11:59.218
Damn.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.514
I ran a red light.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.817
Hey, fellows. Fancy driving.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.947
He saw us? Why didn't he give us a ticket?

12:20.030 --> 12:24.618
Because he believes in our cause!
He's a fellow freedom fighter!

12:24.702 --> 12:27.621
But what does that have to do
with reckless driving?

12:27.705 --> 12:30.791
Plenty! Let me tell you
about another reckless driver.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.544
A man named Paul Revere.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.298
You see, he had a horse that ran very...

12:38.632 --> 12:39.884
Oh, screw it, Old Top.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.303
We're bribing the cops
to stay in business.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.804
He's on the take?

12:45.639 --> 12:47.767
Uh, Mister Buck, we need to stop by

12:47.850 --> 12:52.188
the "green grocer"
and withdraw more "salad."

12:52.271 --> 12:54.106
Relax. He knows.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.862
Dirty cops too?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.907
You are walking a razor's edge, Hank.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.326
Now whisper it again about the cops.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.368
Hey, guys.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.789
Not a big deal, but I need you
to sign this for school.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.999
You got detention for chewing gum?

13:12.082 --> 13:14.877
You can't serve kids Frito pies for lunch

13:14.960 --> 13:18.839
and not expect them to do something
about the breath issues involved.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.634
But you know chewing gum is
against the rules.

13:21.717 --> 13:26.055
It's an unjust rule!
I'm fighting for what I believe in, Dad!

13:43.614 --> 13:44.907
What's happening?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.828
We're liberating Europe
from the Nazis, Hank.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.496
Tom Landry?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.289
That's right.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.335
Before I won two Super Bowls, Hank,
I flew a B-17 in World War II.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.962
Everyone knows that.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.964
I wanted to talk to you
about your lunch truck.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.799
So do a couple of my friends.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.431
We don't think you should be
breaking the law, Hank.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.684
What? But that's what you all did.

14:11.767 --> 14:16.230
Mr. President, you were a loyal British
subject until they pushed you too far.

14:17.773 --> 14:21.443
And you suspended <i>habeas corpus</i>
during the Civil War.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.614
And, Tom, you broke all the rules
with your revolutionary flex defense.

14:25.698 --> 14:30.828
You're on a slippery slope, Hank.
You're ignoring posted traffic laws.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.415
And now Bobby is chewing gum.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.250
But I thought you'd be proud.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.251
We're not.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.379
Krauts, two o'clock high!

14:50.514 --> 14:54.768
You think we could get mayonnaise
outlawed, Old Top?

14:54.852 --> 14:59.106
Mr. Strickland, what do you think Tom
Landry would think of what we're doing?

14:59.189 --> 15:01.775
Top... Well, how the heck should I know?

15:01.859 --> 15:05.613
I... I can't do this anymore, sir.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.573
It just doesn't feel right.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.825
Rooster?

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
What's he doing with a lunch truck?

15:14.371 --> 15:17.082
An illegal lunch truck?

15:23.297 --> 15:26.133
It's my territory now, Strickland!

15:26.216 --> 15:29.803
I'm taking over Arlen's
illegal food business!

15:43.275 --> 15:44.860
You're finished, Strickland!

15:45.611 --> 15:46.612
Finished?

15:48.072 --> 15:49.865
How's this for finished?

15:51.450 --> 15:52.743
Retaliate!

15:58.457 --> 15:59.917
Let's get them, honey.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.638
Who is Rooster and why is he attacking us?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.224
He's an old acquaintance of mine
from Arkansas.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.101
Dirty as the day is long.

16:17.184 --> 16:21.855
Rooster, when I'm done with you,
your nickname's gonna be Chicken!

16:21.939 --> 16:23.482
Doubtful!

16:23.565 --> 16:26.026
This whole thing has gotten
way out of hand.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.071
I thought this truck would help.
But it's making things worse.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.323
I don't think I can be a part of it.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.325
Oh, you can't quit now, Hank.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.745
If we walk away, Arlen will be
at the mercy of Rooster!

16:36.829 --> 16:37.830
You want that...

16:46.296 --> 16:47.798
Okay, fine. I'll help.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.883
But just until we get rid of Rooster.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.052
All right!

16:56.807 --> 17:00.310
♪ You got to give the people, now ♪

17:00.394 --> 17:02.730
Give the people what they want

17:02.813 --> 17:05.107
Well, well, well, well

17:05.190 --> 17:06.608
No, don't know you

17:06.692 --> 17:09.945
You got to give the people

17:10.029 --> 17:12.656
Give the people what they want

17:16.326 --> 17:19.038
<i>♪ But I done been all over the world ♪</i>

17:59.828 --> 18:04.124
And then we missed the lunch rush
because Rooster slashed our tires.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.169
I'm losing a turf war
I don't even want to fight.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.047
Plus, Rooster's food isn't even that good.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.424
What? You've eaten from Rooster's truck?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.343
Just once. Today.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.554
I had a hankering for some ceviche.
Subpar.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.557
Dang it, Dale.
I'm trying to drive that guy out of town.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.684
Yeah, man. That ain't cool, man.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.353
I'm sorry, Hank. But...

18:25.896 --> 18:27.064
You okay there, Dale?

18:27.147 --> 18:30.067
Yes. No. Oh, God!

18:31.902 --> 18:35.823
Raw ceviche from a moving truck?
What went wrong?

18:36.990 --> 18:38.742
Well, it serves you right, Dale.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.828
Yeah, man. Talking about old...

18:40.911 --> 18:44.414
Dang old... Oh, man... Dang old...

18:45.791 --> 18:46.834
You too?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.293
That's what happens

18:48.418 --> 18:49.503
when you sell people poison.

18:49.586 --> 18:53.966
Luckily I have nothing to worry about
thanks to my government-approved diet.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.218
Bill, I didn't want to have to do this.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.679
But I think you should take a look
at yourself.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.849
Oh, God!

19:11.108 --> 19:14.570
Thanks to Rooster, half this town is
hugging their toilets!

19:14.653 --> 19:17.156
Yeah. Must be some kind of food poisoning.

19:17.239 --> 19:21.118
I guess your constant whining
about hygiene and refrigeration

19:21.201 --> 19:22.494
actually served a purpose.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.204
I don't recall whining.

19:24.288 --> 19:28.292
Now, all we got to do is let everybody
know it was Rooster who poisoned them.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.877
And we'll get down to business.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.212
We won, Old Top! We won!

19:32.296 --> 19:36.175
Well, as long as those food bans
are in place, no one has won.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.218
And I'm not sure they're ever going away.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.929
From your mouth to God's ear, Hank.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.399
-<i>Yes?</i>
-Nancy, it's Hank Hill.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.443
I've had enough. I want out.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.155
I think I can help, shug.
Oh, hey, can we use your facilities?

19:58.238 --> 20:00.949
<i>We've been peeing in Snapple bottles</i>
<i>all week.</i>

20:08.916 --> 20:11.960
The only thing your goddang ban's
accomplished

20:12.044 --> 20:14.087
was to drive people into the shadows

20:14.171 --> 20:16.715
to eat where they got poisoned
by a criminal.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.928
Rooster and his crew don't care
about food safety or hygiene.

20:21.011 --> 20:24.139
And Channel 84's Nancy Hicks Gribble
can prove it.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.851
She has video evidence
of Rooster's blatant disregard

20:27.935 --> 20:30.312
for maintaining a sanitary kitchen.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.775
That video includes shots of everyone
who broke the law

20:34.858 --> 20:37.653
and visited Rooster's truck
in the past couple days.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.405
Including people we all might recognize.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.116
We could all watch the tape.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.662
Or you could repeal the food bans.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.163
I say we repeal the bans.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.875
Yes! Let us return the power of choice
to the people of Arlen.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.462
And attach a small addendum to the bill
which orders the destruction of that tape.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.381
-All in favor?
-Aye!

21:07.891 --> 21:10.852
Do you know why these hushpuppies
taste so good, Bobby?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.187
Trans-fat?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.774
Because you're not breaking the rules
to eat them. Right, Peggy?

21:15.857 --> 21:18.277
Hm? Oh, yeah, yeah. Rules good.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.782
Hey, bad boy. What do you say we skip out
on the check, huh?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.909
-No.
-How about this?

21:25.993 --> 21:28.287
We load up my purse
with packets of Splenda.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.832
By the time they know what hit them,
we'll be long gone.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.292
<i>No.</i>

22:15.083 --> 22:17.669
-<i>But I thought you'd be proud.</i>
<i>We're not.</i>
