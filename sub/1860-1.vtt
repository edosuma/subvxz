01:10.171 --> 01:11.581
<i>Hey, I've been doing some homework</i>

01:11.672 --> 01:13.743
<i>on this kid Tobey Marshall
from Mount Kisco.</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:17.117
<i>This kid was a phenom.
Used to tear up the local circuits.</i>

01:17.210 --> 01:20.453
<i>Him and his dad, man,
they campaigned like champions.</i>

01:20.547 --> 01:22.925
<i>Of course, Mount Kisco
had another great, Dino Brewster.</i>

01:23.016 --> 01:24.120
<i>You all know Dino.</i>

01:24.217 --> 01:25.787
<i>He went on to race
in the big leagues at Indy</i>

01:25.886 --> 01:29.060
<i>and Tobey just kind of
fell through the cracks.</i>

01:29.122 --> 01:31.363
<i>Well, here's some news' cretins.</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:34.372
<i>Tobey's been running again,
and running fast,.</i>

01:34.428 --> 01:38.103
<i>Real fast, fast as
that "Grim Taquito" will take him.</i>

01:38.198 --> 01:41.771
<i>Tobey, you wanna ﬂy with the eagles,</i>

01:41.868 --> 01:43.745
<i>you need bigger wings, son.</i>

01:43.804 --> 01:45.147
<i>I'm just telling you right now</i>

01:45.238 --> 01:49.448
<i>that if Tobey Marshall
ever got a car worthy of his talents,</i>

01:49.543 --> 01:52.456
<i>he could be toeing the line at De Leon.</i>

01:55.482 --> 01:57.086
Give me four clicks of compression.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.560
All right.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.058
Actually, make it three.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.161
No, two. Two is perfect.

02:06.259 --> 02:09.103
You wanna make up your mind?
What is it, two, three, or four'?

02:09.162 --> 02:10.765
- Exactly.
- Yo, guys!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.071
You know I'm gonna hurt you, right?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.509
- Two.
- Thank you.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.978
Guys. Joe, you gotta
check this out, man.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.742
- Yo.
- Monarch's on fire.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.141
<i>Cretin, go ahead.</i>

02:19.239 --> 02:21.150
<i>Monarch, this is Darryl
from East Orange.</i>

02:21.241 --> 02:23.915
<i>Why would you let</i> a <i>redneck
trust fund baby into the De Leon?</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:26.321
<i>He doesn't deserve to</i> be
<i>in a winner-takes-all</i> race

02:26.413 --> 02:28.017
<i>with multi-million-dollar cars!</i>

02:28.115 --> 02:29.236
- Come on, Monarch!
- Caller?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.094
Do I get to talk?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.697
Darryl, have your parents
ever smacked you upside the head?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.665
See, this is a case where sometimes
you just need to beat kids.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.136
Darryl, Darryl, it's my show. I get...

02:40.193 --> 02:41.831
Shut up! Listen to me!

02:41.928 --> 02:43.305
Darryl, one important question.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.502
Have you ever even driven a race car?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.169
That's what I thought.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.780
Let me explain to all
of you people out there

02:49.870 --> 02:51.508
how this works one more time.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.377
It's my race.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.283
It's the De Leon. I created it.

02:57.444 --> 03:00.015
It's rarefied air, kids. It's beautiful.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.558
I decide who gets in,

03:01.648 --> 03:04.219
and who does not
get in to the race, okay?

03:04.384 --> 03:06.295
I loved your dad.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.627
He was a customer of
the bank for 30 years.

03:09.790 --> 03:10.996
Thirty.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.203
What y'all talking about?

03:13.293 --> 03:15.333
<i>The Flyin' Hawaiian just took down
Steve Heavy Chevy</i>

03:15.395 --> 03:16.703
<i>- in the Arizona desert.
- What?</i>

03:22.969 --> 03:26.883
<i>Man invitation as</i> a <i>wild card.
Okay? That's important.</i>

03:26.973 --> 03:28.714
<i>Wild card. Maybe.</i>

03:28.809 --> 03:31.551
<i>I'm not saying he's in,
I'm saying he might be.</i>

03:32.646 --> 03:34.182
Who was that?

03:34.815 --> 03:37.489
He's just an old customer of my dads.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.854
I didn't recognize him.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.764
Yeah, he might bring
his car in on Friday.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.335
What's wrong with it?

03:45.492 --> 03:46.869
Our job to find out.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.739
I was thinking about the race tonight.
We should get there early.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.709
Five cars, the race is full.
Pot should be, like, what?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.211
Five grand.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.894
- Tobey.
- Pete.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.965
- You good?
- Good.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.505
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.336
You know,
Monarch gave you a shout-out.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.069
- Then he shit on your car.
- Yeah, I know. I heard.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.235
Never mind that.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.646
While Monarch was talking about you,
I had a vision.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.072
All right, here we go.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.483
Quiet, okay?
I happen to like his visions.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.610
Pete, proceed, please.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.683
I see water, and the sun, and...

05:13.847 --> 05:16.088
- Your sister in a bikini.
- Shut it.

05:16.249 --> 05:19.025
I see Tobey looking at a lighthouse.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.924
I see you,
and you're gonna win De Leon.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.093
- Really?
- Hey.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.966
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Pete,

05:26.026 --> 05:27.334
but I got my hands full

05:27.427 --> 05:31.603
trying to beat Jimmy Macintosh
and you tonight, so...

05:36.937 --> 05:38.610
Oh, man.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.344
My sister and Dino are here.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.783
She didn't tell me
she was coming home, Tobe.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.548
I'm sorry.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.184
No, it's fine.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.720
Coming with Dino isn't.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.861
What's this fool
even doing back here, man?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.225
Maybe he just came to watch
how a real racer drives.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.165
The guy raced Indy.

05:59.226 --> 06:02.298
It doesn't get more real than that, Finn.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.710
Let's go, Tobey.
You don't need that distraction.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.973
No, it's fine.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.037
All right, boys,
the race is gonna start soon.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.810
Ben, you should head up.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.817
I just wanna let
you know I'm going because I want to

06:15.976 --> 06:17.512
and not because you told me to.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.247
- Just know that.
- Okay.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.823
Way to put your foot down, Benny.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.394
Nice pleather jacket, homie.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.360
- Hey.
- Hi, guys. Hi, Petey.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.488
How are you?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.032
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.534
- Are you racing tonight?
- Yeah.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.192
- You be careful.
- Okay.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.531
<i>Okay.</i>

06:39.566 --> 06:41.239
Hi, Tobey.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.108
Anita.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.115
I'm really sorry to hear about your dad.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.183
Did you get my flowers?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.856
Yeah.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.519
Good.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.230
And thank you for watching out for Pete.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.192
He's like a little brother to me.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.196
How's the shop?

07:05.625 --> 07:08.538
The shop is... It's good.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.630
It's good.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.067
Yeah?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.474
How's the city?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.748
It's different than I expected,

07:19.806 --> 07:22.616
but it's not here.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.326
Are you still allergic to Mount Kisco?

07:29.950 --> 07:33.625
Actually, Dino has something
he wants to talk to you about.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.960
I doubt that.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.002
After the race, though.
I don't wanna distract you.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.136
Then you should have
stayed in Manhattan.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.076
You look beautiful.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.021
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.758
<i>Have you got the roads looked dawn?</i>

08:01.915 --> 08:03.121
The road is clear.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.923
We are at the finish line
and Benny is in the Cessna.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.365
<i>Liar One, you standing by?</i>

08:10.523 --> 08:12.093
<i>Here we go with this again.</i>

08:12.258 --> 08:13.328
I wouldn't have to use that handle

08:13.426 --> 08:15.707
if you stopped telling people you
flew Apache helicopters.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.605
I took an Apache for a Joyride, okay?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.768
That's all I said.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.093
I know that's what you said.
We just don't believe you.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.705
Hey, man, look,
just because I'm a crew chief

08:22.802 --> 08:24.282
doesn't mean I don't know how to fly.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.441
You gotta have balls
of titanium alloy to do what I do.

08:27.607 --> 08:31.555
<i>So I need a little respect.
A little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</i>

08:31.945 --> 08:34.221
All right, enough messing around.
What's the status,

08:34.381 --> 08:35.792
Liar One?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.222
<i>Clear, and this is "Maverick."</i>

08:37.984 --> 08:39.327
Call me Maverick,

08:39.385 --> 08:41.730
or I will kamikaze this
into your nut sack.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.750
Mind if I watch?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.149
<i>Okay, gentlemen, please be advised,</i>

10:42.242 --> 10:43.778
<i>I got traffic ahead.</i>

10:43.943 --> 10:45.820
Repeat' I got traffic ahead.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.340
That was close. He got lucky.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.441
It's not luck. He's patient.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.365
Sorry, little buddy.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.565
My house!

13:18.898 --> 13:19.899
Benny!

13:20.166 --> 13:23.079
You bodied that guy's grocery cart.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.078
What's wrong with you?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.431
Yeah!

14:16.022 --> 14:17.626
Yeah!

14:20.626 --> 14:22.799
Sweet!

14:23.229 --> 14:26.335
<i>Hey, yo, Father Joseph,
make sure you save me a beer, buddy.</i>

14:26.399 --> 14:27.878
<i>Hello?</i>

14:31.971 --> 14:33.382
That's what we do. That's right.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.513
Benny, my man.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.915
I thought you had him, brother.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.081
Nah, I had him in the turns.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.918
Where were you? We missed you,
brother, we missed you.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.083
What do you mean?

14:42.181 --> 14:43.216
I was ﬂying, watching your butts.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.727
- You were flying?
- Flying?

14:44.851 --> 14:47.559
- I didn't see him flying.
- Y'all gonna play me like that?

14:47.653 --> 14:49.257
- I didn't see him flying.
- Did you see him flying?

14:49.355 --> 14:51.232
Maybe you should ask
the shopping cart guy

14:51.324 --> 14:52.484
if he saw you ﬂying up there.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.605
Shots fired! Boom, boom!

14:55.695 --> 14:57.215
So I'm supposed to watch out for cops,

14:57.263 --> 14:59.174
fly the plane,
make sure you got a clear lane

14:59.232 --> 15:01.109
and look out for homeless people
coming out of the shadows?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.873
I didn't get that memo, I'm sorry.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.897
Nice driving.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.196
I'm impressed.

15:25.124 --> 15:26.865
<i>T obey Marsha“.</i>

15:27.794 --> 15:30.400
The man to beat in Mount Kisco.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.476
Sorry about your old man.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.745
I know you were close.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.047
You lost, Dino?

15:44.477 --> 15:45.751
What?

15:46.078 --> 15:48.285
I mean, I haven't seen you
around for a long time.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.759
I figured, you know, you must be lost.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.220
So, nothing has changed.

15:55.221 --> 15:58.225
After 10 years, you wanna
just pick up some locker room fight.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.562
What do you want?

16:00.726 --> 16:02.603
I wanna see you build a real car.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.606
I got plenty of cars to build, Dino.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.843
Yeah.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.812
How's that going for you?

16:12.271 --> 16:13.750
I didn't come to insult you.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.594
I came to make a business proposition.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.920
It could be a game-changer for you.

16:20.079 --> 16:21.922
Are you handing out
dreams now, Dino'?

16:22.081 --> 16:26.086
I've seen a hundred custom racing
shops since I left this town.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.930
I still haven't seen
work <i>as</i> good as yours.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.700
That's these guys. Not me.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.135
I have a very special car
that needs to be finished.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.814
What kind of car are we talking about?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.467
Ford Mustang.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.433
A Mustang?

16:42.869 --> 16:44.678
It's the one Ford
and Carroll Shelby were building

16:44.770 --> 16:46.477
when Carroll died.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.214
How did you get it?

16:49.375 --> 16:51.514
Mr. Shelby and my uncle,
they were close.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.357
You finish building my Mustang
like you rebuilt that Gran Torino,

16:57.049 --> 16:59.620
I'll give you a quarter
of what we get for the car.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.287
A quarter'?

17:01.454 --> 17:03.229
The car is worth 2 million.

17:03.789 --> 17:04.961
Minimum.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.064
That's $500,000 in your pocket.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.734
Forget about the past, Tobey.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.641
It's history.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.982
I'm hereto make peace.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.419
And money.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.714
Don't answer me now.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.224
Just think about it.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.989
I don't need 10 think about it.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.997
I'll do it.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.332
I'll get the car here tomorrow.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.344
Okay, I just wanna be the first
to take the ﬂoor here and ask you...

17:58.945 --> 18:01.016
Have you lost your mind?

18:01.180 --> 18:03.182
You're gonna have us
work for Dino Brewster?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.353
Word?

18:04.517 --> 18:05.928
What are you thinking, Tobey?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.122
You don't wanna have anything
to do with that piece of shit.

18:08.220 --> 18:11.565
And, look, if this is about Anita,
trying to get her back or something...

18:11.624 --> 18:13.103
Do it another way, homie.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.364
Write a poem or some shit. Okay?

18:15.528 --> 18:16.768
I'll help you out.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.877
"Dear Anita,
Nothing is sweeter than Anita

18:21.033 --> 18:23.809
"I really aneeda... Anita"

18:25.204 --> 18:27.115
And I just came up with that just now.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.547
Just now!

18:30.109 --> 18:32.453
Yo, forget about
that fool and his turtleneck.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.482
All right? Just tell him you're out.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.718
We're doing fine without him.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.293
We're not.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.560
Okay. We're not doing fine.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.601
Look...

18:56.235 --> 19:00.411
I'm behind on the loan.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.779
That guy from earlier...

19:03.976 --> 19:06.183
That guy is from the bank.

19:06.345 --> 19:09.815
And he's just gonna keep coming back.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.929
Tobey, if you say we need him,

19:16.455 --> 19:18.162
then I'm with you.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.801
Wait. We made five grand tonight.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.034
It's gotta be enough
to make the payment.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.438
What about next month?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.943
We'll figure it out.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.511
We always do.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.049
This time it's different, okay?

19:38.344 --> 19:41.791
If you guys don't show up tomorrow

19:41.881 --> 19:43.360
to work on that car,

19:45.384 --> 19:47.125
we're gonna lose this place.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.795
Hey, come on, guys.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.167
This is Carroll Shelby.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.708
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.211
We're doing this. All right? For Tobey.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.804
9:30 tomorrow. Don't be late.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.087
You're cheating, man. Quit cheating!

20:13.245 --> 20:14.883
You just can't keep up.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.254
Shit!

20:18.084 --> 20:19.495
Here we go.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.830
Yeah.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.532
All right, all right, all right.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.345
Where is the rest of it?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.843
We got a lot of work to do.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.041
Yeah.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.634
Do you like that car over there?

22:06.792 --> 22:08.601
- Yeah, it's nice.
- Yeah.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.767
We built that.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.275
So, you're a mechanic.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.609
That was real smooth, bro.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.445
Hey. Do you like that car over there?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.614
Okay. Excuse me.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.449
We built that.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.317
We're mechanics.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.461
We're not afraid to get our hands dirty.

22:32.618 --> 22:35.121
Do you know what I mean?

22:36.722 --> 22:38.395
Do you like that car over there?

22:55.307 --> 22:57.150
How fast does it go?

22:58.844 --> 23:00.152
<i>Fast.</i>

23:00.312 --> 23:01.882
Very fast. Pete.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.316
Aren't all Mustangs fast?

23:04.817 --> 23:08.663
Well, this one was built by Ford
and reimagined by Carroll Shelby,

23:08.821 --> 23:11.358
the greatest performance car
builder in American history.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.503
She's not from around here, Petey,

23:13.559 --> 23:17.837
so she probably
has no idea who Carroll Shelby is.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.507
But why is it so fast?

23:20.666 --> 23:23.237
It's 900 horsepower, baby.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.247
Is that a lot?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.912
- Are you kidding me?
- Petey.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.179
Look, miss, this isn't the kind of car
you can just go to the mall and buy.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.353
Trust me when I say, it's one of a kind.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.850
Can I see the engine?

23:40.052 --> 23:41.258
Sure.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.273
5.8 liter, aluminum block,

23:55.601 --> 23:59.549
SVT supercharger and racing headers.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.711
Yeah, it's quite nice, actually.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.122
I wasn't expecting that.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.157
Nor was I.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.454
Why?

24:11.617 --> 24:13.893
Because I'm a woman?
Or because I'm from England?

24:14.720 --> 24:19.294
Mr. Shelby's first Cobra was built
using an AC body made in England.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.439
It had a Ford 260 CID V8 engine.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.097
Of course, you already knew that.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.004
Life can be full of surprises.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.849
I find life to be full of
people who think they're smart

24:32.938 --> 24:34.940
because they have a fancy accent.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.008
No offense.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.582
Some taken.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.084
I really love Piers Morgan.

24:42.915 --> 24:43.985
So, this is how it goes, is it?

24:44.083 --> 24:45.653
You're very quiet, very tough,

24:45.751 --> 24:49.130
and then you're just constantly
cracking these hilarious jokes.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.457
Hey, Jules.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.601
Three million is way too much
for this car, Dino.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.436
Well, that's what it costs.

24:57.796 --> 25:00.333
- Let's see what Ingram thinks.
- I am what Ingram thinks,

25:00.432 --> 25:01.968
and he thinks two at the most.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.104
Well, three is the number.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.422
Three is absurd.
That's why nobody has bid on it.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.978
That's the best car
I've driven since Indy.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.813
You haven't driven it, Dino.
Tobey's had the keys the whole time.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.581
Do you want me to turn around
and plug my ears

25:16.615 --> 25:18.356
while you all gel on the same page?

25:19.118 --> 25:20.119
What's the top speed?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.528
- 180.
- 230.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.655
230'?

25:22.788 --> 25:24.631
He's talking about
a theoretical top speed.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.631
I know that you don't really talk,

25:26.692 --> 25:29.639
but maybe Mr. Strong and Silent
could be a little less silent.

25:30.496 --> 25:31.975
She'll go 230.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.168
Top NASCAR speed ever was 228.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.473
This car is faster.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.216
8:00 am, tomorrow at Shepperton.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.254
You get anything close
to 230 out of this car,

25:47.346 --> 25:48.882
Ingram is going to buy it on the spot.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.220
For 3 million.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.020
Give or take a million.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.656
Mostly take.

25:55.687 --> 25:56.893
Good night, lads.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.061
Bye.

26:02.694 --> 26:03.832
230'?

26:03.996 --> 26:05.998
Are you crazy?
What if I can't get the car there?

26:06.331 --> 26:09.107
Well, maybe you can't,

26:09.201 --> 26:11.738
but I can.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.210
I'll drive.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.509
Don't even think about driving that car.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.544
Yeah, Tobey!

27:01.086 --> 27:03.464
What are you guys doing?

27:04.089 --> 27:06.797
Stop! Stop!

27:10.462 --> 27:11.736
What the hell are you doing?

27:12.431 --> 27:15.469
You don't own this car!
You don't get to joyride it!

27:15.634 --> 27:17.773
Top speed just over 230.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.472
234.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.776
According to this.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.580
He'!-

27:27.412 --> 27:28.618
That was some driving, son.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.628
And that is one hell of a car.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.621
It's going to cost me $3 million?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.430
That's the price.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.466
2.7.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.281
2.7 million?

27:57.142 --> 27:59.383
What the hell were you thinking?

27:59.778 --> 28:02.156
We sold the car, Dino.

28:03.448 --> 28:06.520
You never could've got that car to 230.
Even on our track.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.490
You think you're
a better driver than me?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.228
Everyone knows he's a better driver.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.634
You know, I'm just about
done with you, Pete.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.297
Hey! Back off, Dino.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.636
I'll beat you on a track, the dirt,

28:20.699 --> 28:22.645
a road, anywhere else you wanna race.

28:22.801 --> 28:25.179
Hey, you're the man, okay?

28:25.337 --> 28:26.338
You're the pro.

28:26.405 --> 28:27.713
You got nothing to prove to me.
Let's move on.

28:27.873 --> 28:28.874
No.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.315
No, let's race.

28:30.475 --> 28:34.150
If you win, I'll give you
my 75% of the Mustang deal.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.022
If you lose,

28:36.648 --> 28:39.026
you give me your 25%.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.829
Well, that makes it interesting.

28:56.835 --> 28:58.837
This is the biggest house
I've ever seen.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.173
It's my uncle's place.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.843
Don't worry, he's in Monaco.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.522
These aren't even legal
in the United States.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.387
They're all Euro-spec cars,

29:08.513 --> 29:10.193
so technically,
they don't even exist here.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.892
Are they some kind of Ferrari?

29:13.185 --> 29:14.858
Koenigsegg Agera R.

29:15.020 --> 29:18.194
Top speed, 270 miles an hour.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.732
But, Dino, I thought
you didn't go faster than 180.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.206
You got a big mouth for a fan.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.038
Yeah, well, then let me race.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.874
I'll be happy to have you, Pete.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.709
- Awesome. I'm in.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.246
Hey. Sit this one out.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.408
No. Lei him be a big boy.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.648
Three identical Ageras.

29:41.747 --> 29:42.782
After you.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.936
The finish line is at the end
of the bridge, over the 684.

29:56.094 --> 29:58.574
The first car to get
to the other side wins.

30:07.572 --> 30:08.915
<i>Tow!-.</i>

30:13.578 --> 30:15.319
This is my vision.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.992
This is how I saw you winning De Leon.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.962
You beat Dino, take his car and win.

30:41.807 --> 30:42.979
Wow.

32:29.714 --> 32:30.715
Whoa!

32:59.911 --> 33:01.481
Thanks, little buddy!

33:02.981 --> 33:04.085
You got it' man!

33:08.186 --> 33:09.358
Yeah, Pete.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.506
Come on!

33:29.140 --> 33:31.017
We got him, Pete.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.396
No!

34:31.735 --> 34:34.376
No, no, no, no, no.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.365
Pete!

35:01.266 --> 35:02.802
No!

35:24.422 --> 35:25.730
No!

35:48.913 --> 35:52.417
"Fear not, for I am with you.

35:52.484 --> 35:55.488
"Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.158
"Behold, all those who
were incensed against you

35:58.256 --> 36:00.600
"shall be ashamed and disgraced.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.330
"They shall be nothing.

36:03.428 --> 36:07.877
"Those who war against you
shall be as nothing.

36:07.966 --> 36:11.175
"For I shall hold your right hand,
saying to you,

36:11.269 --> 36:15.274
"'Fear not, I will help you."'

36:16.474 --> 36:19.978
Let's go through this again,
Mr. Marshall.

36:20.145 --> 36:23.456
A couple witnesses say
they may have seen three cars,

36:23.615 --> 36:26.619
but we can't find the third car.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.497
Why don't you use
that diagram there to show us

36:30.622 --> 36:32.693
where you claim
the third car to have been.

36:38.496 --> 36:42.808
My car was about
two car lengths ahead.

36:45.003 --> 36:50.385
This is where Pete was,
and Dino was right behind him.

36:50.475 --> 36:54.821
He tapped his back bumper hard,
and at an angle.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.860
Dino has two witnesses who say they
were with him the whole day.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.028
And the owner of Brewster Motors

37:01.086 --> 37:03.999
reported two Koenigseggs
stolen last week.

37:05.724 --> 37:09.831
Just seven minutes before police
arrived at the scene of the crash.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.834
That's his uncle, okay?

37:12.997 --> 37:15.876
They're lying.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.879
All right? He was there.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.254
Dino was there.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.448
Mr. Marshall,

37:29.748 --> 37:33.025
you're the only one
that can place Dino at the scene.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.924
No way is this happening.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.397
This isn't happening.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.939
Pete... This isn't happening.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.397
<i>- Bill Ingram speaking.</i>
- Sign <i>here.</i>

38:09.554 --> 38:11.625
<i>Mr. Ingram, Tobey Marshall.</i>

38:11.723 --> 38:14.067
<i>I need to borrow your Mustang
to race De Leon.</i>

38:16.895 --> 38:19.000
<i>Excuse me, son?</i>

38:19.297 --> 38:21.675
<i>You wan! 10 race
my Mustang in De Leon?</i>

38:21.833 --> 38:23.073
<i>What's in it for me?</i>

38:23.234 --> 38:25.612
<i>When I win, I will give you half the cars.</i>

38:27.005 --> 38:29.918
<i>That's around $4 million for you.</i>

38:30.942 --> 38:32.683
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

38:32.844 --> 38:34.619
<i>I'll call Julia.</i>

38:34.679 --> 38:36.920
All right. Step forward. Go. Everybody.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.435
Come on. Come to me.

38:46.591 --> 38:47.934
That's my boy.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.127
Is Joe in?

38:49.194 --> 38:50.594
Already on the road with the Beast.

38:50.628 --> 38:52.748
If this thing works,
we're gonna need that head start.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.936
What about Finn?

38:54.098 --> 38:57.341
We haven't convinced him yet,
but we will. It's Finn.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.382
But more importantly'
do we even have a vehicle?

38:59.437 --> 39:01.508
I'll know in an hour.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.686
Hey, thanks for dropping it off.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.914
And thank Ingram for me, please.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.090
So, what do you think?

40:16.180 --> 40:18.023
First American car to win De Leon?

40:18.082 --> 40:19.186
Definitely.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.386
You don't even have an invite.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.962
Monarch is gonna want
this car in the race.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.901
Nobody knows where
the race is until you get the invite,

40:30.061 --> 40:34.066
so exactly where would you
be driving off to?

40:34.232 --> 40:36.712
Well, on the low,
we know it's in California,

40:36.768 --> 40:38.213
we just don't know where.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.415
And we also know
that one of the drivers is...

40:40.471 --> 40:41.973
- Benny.
- Okay, I'll shut up.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.882
California is quite a big state

40:44.943 --> 40:49.153
and you might remember
that I'm a numbers girl.

40:49.314 --> 40:52.124
Okay, so what are
your numbers telling you?

40:52.283 --> 40:54.490
There's a drivers' meeting
the night before the race.

40:54.652 --> 40:58.429
And that means you
have 45 hours or less

40:58.489 --> 41:03.131
to get from New York
to somewhere in California.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.431
And your problem is...

41:06.564 --> 41:08.669
We better get going.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.437
It's 45 hours and counting.

41:10.601 --> 41:12.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, wait, wait!

41:13.071 --> 41:14.345
You're not going anywhere.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.847
You need a right-seater.

41:18.776 --> 41:22.690
And Ingram is not going
to leave this car

41:22.780 --> 41:25.420
in the hands of an ex-con

41:25.850 --> 41:28.831
who is about to leave
the state and break parole.

41:30.488 --> 41:34.630
44 hours and 59 minutes left.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.203
Let's go.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.349
<i>Okay-</i>

41:48.506 --> 41:51.146
Maybe we can just
ditch her at a gas station or something.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.845
Hey, man. Look, you want her gone?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.991
I'll broom her ass out. Okay?

41:55.046 --> 41:57.526
Just follow me, dude. I'll have you
driving like a bat out of hell.

41:57.615 --> 42:00.152
She'll be screaming
to get out of this car.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.165
She's just crazy, you know'?

42:04.122 --> 42:05.567
She talks too much.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.991
Okay, so you've never
been a right-seater.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.320
Well, if you see something
I'm doing wrong,

42:31.382 --> 42:32.759
just point it out.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.096
First of all, you're wearing high heels.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.758
We just call them heels.

42:40.591 --> 42:43.401
But if it's a real problem,
then I can always...

42:43.561 --> 42:45.402
I've got a change of
shoes in my overnight bag.

42:48.433 --> 42:49.844
Yep, okay-

42:52.904 --> 42:54.349
So, is there anything else

42:54.405 --> 42:57.511
that right-seaters are supposed to do?

42:58.242 --> 42:59.619
Be quiet.

42:59.877 --> 43:02.357
<i>Hello, Beauty.
This is Maverick speaking,</i>

43:03.347 --> 43:05.452
<i>the most awesome pilot
in the universe.</i>

43:05.616 --> 43:07.061
Just wanted to give you a heads-up

43:07.118 --> 43:08.756
and tell you about a little
stop-and-go traffic up ahead.

43:08.853 --> 43:10.093
Nothing too serious.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.967
We got traffic up ahead.
We're gonna need to reroute.

43:16.861 --> 43:18.135
I don't see any traffic.

43:18.729 --> 43:21.801
Well, Benny does,
and he sees everything.

43:23.634 --> 43:25.113
<i>Al! right. Now, give me
a dollar on the next exit.</i>

43:25.269 --> 43:26.942
What's a dollar?

43:39.550 --> 43:41.393
<i>Hard right for lane three.</i>

43:42.954 --> 43:44.160
<i>In three,</i>

43:44.255 --> 43:45.290
two,

43:45.389 --> 43:46.424
- one.
- Uh, no.

43:46.591 --> 43:47.626
<i>Now.</i>

43:52.263 --> 43:54.223
<i>You're looking a little
filthy down there, Beauty.</i>

43:54.265 --> 43:55.626
- It's time to get you clean.
What?

43:55.633 --> 43:58.443
<i>Hard left U in three, two, one.</i>

44:04.242 --> 44:06.483
Oh. my God!

44:13.684 --> 44:14.685
<i>Go</i> three...

44:14.785 --> 44:15.786
<i>Now.</i>

44:24.428 --> 44:25.600
<i>You are moving, baby!</i>

44:37.008 --> 44:39.852
You do at least see the SUV
that we are about to slam into?

44:45.383 --> 44:47.829
You meant that one? The green one?

44:54.292 --> 44:55.464
Tobey!

44:59.530 --> 45:01.203
- You see the bus, right?
What's that?

45:01.532 --> 45:02.567
The bus!

45:04.569 --> 45:05.912
The bus! The bus! The bus!

45:06.003 --> 45:07.004
Go two, now.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.689
Looks like a scene
out of Speed down there.

45:13.844 --> 45:15.255
<i>Hard left in three, Keanu.</i>

45:17.348 --> 45:20.488
You mean that bus, bus, bus.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.498
Just so you know,
your friend Benny sucks.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.032
<i>Hard left in one.</i>

45:32.697 --> 45:34.074
<i>My man!</i>

45:34.232 --> 45:36.735
<i>You got some skills, boy.
You know you bad.</i>

45:36.901 --> 45:38.209
<i>You know you bad!</i>

45:52.183 --> 45:56.222
Beauty, it looks to me like you're
all clear from here, my friend.

45:56.554 --> 45:57.589
That's right.

45:58.189 --> 46:01.363
<i>I'm just gonna keep
doing my thing, and...</i>

46:01.525 --> 46:05.701
<i>Fly like an eagle, to the sea</i>

46:05.863 --> 46:09.310
<i>Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me</i>

46:09.467 --> 46:12.414
<i>Go on and ﬂy!</i>

46:21.145 --> 46:24.319
You know, I get that driving fast
is going to be necessary,

46:24.415 --> 46:27.055
but driving like a complete maniac
in order to scare me out of the car

46:27.118 --> 46:28.722
is not going to work.

46:29.754 --> 46:30.892
Are you sure about that?

46:33.057 --> 46:34.331
Is that what you think?

46:40.398 --> 46:42.503
Whatever you think about me,

46:43.567 --> 46:44.568
I'm sure it's wrong.

46:45.503 --> 46:47.642
Educate me.

46:48.739 --> 46:51.276
So you think just because

46:51.342 --> 46:53.822
I make a living buying cars
designed to triple the speed limit,

46:53.844 --> 46:56.688
and because I drive a Maserati,
and by the way, I'm an awesome driver,

46:56.781 --> 46:58.501
that you have the right
to condescend to me?

47:02.453 --> 47:07.835
Well, this is going to be the longest
44 hours and 11 minutes of your life.

47:15.099 --> 47:16.772
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.007
You don't have to try that hard.

47:19.103 --> 47:21.447
The sound of a guy called the Monarch

47:21.505 --> 47:23.678
who hosts a secret race
is hard to believe.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.684
He's supposedly from
an old wealthy family

47:25.776 --> 47:28.154
that made their money
in the Industrial Revolution.

47:28.479 --> 47:29.999
- And no one knows who he is?
- No one'

47:31.048 --> 47:34.791
Legend is he sponsored
a few Formula One teams

47:34.952 --> 47:36.727
but always campaigned
under other names.

47:37.121 --> 47:38.794
A man of mystery.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.869
Mystery and a bad heart.

47:41.058 --> 47:42.833
He had a dalliance <i>as</i> a driver,

47:42.893 --> 47:45.533
but his head stopped
like a watch one day.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.902
So he quit.

47:47.064 --> 47:49.408
So what's the prize for this De Leon'?

47:50.701 --> 47:51.975
Well,

47:52.136 --> 47:55.140
big risks come with big rewards.

47:55.306 --> 47:58.480
Maybe that's why I walked away
with $6 million worth of cars.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.817
- That sounds like a good day's work.
- Yes, it was.

48:00.978 --> 48:05.256
Look, I don't mean to push you,
but I have another interested party.

48:05.416 --> 48:07.987
I'm not 100% sure about them.
You know that feeling?

48:09.153 --> 48:11.064
I liked what I saw at your dealership.

48:11.155 --> 48:14.329
The problem I have is,
you haven't shown a hard profit yet.

48:14.492 --> 48:17.336
But I thought you said the dealership
was in profits last year.

48:22.166 --> 48:23.941
Let me be blunt.

48:24.568 --> 48:26.844
What do I have to do to get
a real commitment from you?

48:27.004 --> 48:29.575
I'll be blunt back.
What's a real commitment?

48:29.740 --> 48:30.741
Five million.

48:35.846 --> 48:38.258
Okay, but

48:38.416 --> 48:40.418
you have to win this
secret De Leon again.

48:41.185 --> 48:43.756
And all those cars that come with it.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.283
Yo.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.887
<i>Checking in.</i>

49:06.877 --> 49:10.381
Mile marker 417. We're on schedule.

49:11.148 --> 49:14.618
I know we're on schedule.
I'm checking on you, bro.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.894
I was just sitting here thinking,

49:19.757 --> 49:21.498
Pete would have loved this trip.

49:22.393 --> 49:23.599
Yeah.

49:25.396 --> 49:28.275
He loved the impossible, huh?

49:28.432 --> 49:30.776
Perfect for Petey.

49:32.403 --> 49:34.246
<i>Where's your head at, brother?</i>

49:35.072 --> 49:37.575
I'll never forget what I saw that day.

49:38.843 --> 49:40.754
<i>Listen, don't you wow.</i>

49:40.911 --> 49:43.016
<i>Dino's gonna get what's coming to him.</i>

49:43.581 --> 49:46.528
Just don't forget why we're doing this.

49:48.419 --> 49:51.593
I'll see you in Detroit, brother.
Beast out.

49:59.763 --> 50:01.970
I'm sorry about Pete.

50:09.607 --> 50:12.110
He just left him there.

50:13.811 --> 50:16.951
That's what I can't forgive.

50:19.450 --> 50:22.624
That's what this is really
about then, isn't it'?

50:48.846 --> 50:50.018
Good morning.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.671
Dude, stop calling me, okay?
We've already had this conversation.

51:10.834 --> 51:13.075
<i>Just go to the window.
Ne.</i>

51:14.838 --> 51:15.873
Why?

51:16.707 --> 51:19.347
<i>Just go to the window.
Quit being a little bitch.</i>

51:21.412 --> 51:22.914
You're the bitch.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.063
<i>Unit 4-Adam,</i>

51:39.196 --> 51:40.766
<i>report of noise complaint,
Woodward circle.</i>

51:40.864 --> 51:42.264
<i>Vehicle description, silver</i> Ford...

51:42.266 --> 51:44.109
What the hell are you doing?

51:45.035 --> 51:47.106
<i>- Keeping the engine hot.
- Unit 4 responding.</i>

51:47.204 --> 51:49.445
You're gonna attract
attention to yourself.

51:53.544 --> 51:55.717
Shit.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.231
Is that your car, son?

52:04.054 --> 52:06.967
No, no, no, no, no.

52:07.124 --> 52:10.401
Are you crazy?
Do you know how expensive this car is?

52:10.894 --> 52:13.101
Why don't you just
take it around the corner?

52:13.263 --> 52:16.608
Hey, hey, did you see
how fast I was going?

52:16.767 --> 52:20.408
It must have been, like,
160 on that off-ramp.

52:20.571 --> 52:23.245
You should drive this car. It's amazing!

52:23.407 --> 52:26.411
- Officer, I am so sorry.
- It's insane! Insane.

52:26.577 --> 52:29.183
My boyfriend was showing off.
He's trying to impress me.

52:29.346 --> 52:32.623
Why don't we just take
it around the block? Now.

52:36.954 --> 52:38.524
"Boyfriend"?

52:39.289 --> 52:41.269
I'm just trying to keep us out of jail.

52:42.026 --> 52:44.939
Well, you might wanna fix your hair.

52:48.866 --> 52:50.777
For my mug shot?

52:50.868 --> 52:51.869
No.

52:54.104 --> 52:56.983
Because I'm about to make you famous.

52:58.475 --> 52:59.613
<i>Finn, ave you mere?</i>

52:59.777 --> 53:01.450
<i>- I'm here.
- All right.</i>

53:01.612 --> 53:03.114
Don't mind the cop.
That's not the problem.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.282
Watch how the car leans
as he pulls away.

53:05.449 --> 53:07.224
That's our problem.

53:08.452 --> 53:09.453
Go, go!

53:24.068 --> 53:26.571
In pursuit' modified Ford Mustang.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.177
<i>Heading east on Woodward.</i>

53:35.646 --> 53:36.818
The car is loose.

53:37.147 --> 53:38.649
Yeah, I know. Thank you for that.

53:38.816 --> 53:42.263
If Tobey runs that setup in De Leon,
he won't finish, let alone win.

53:42.352 --> 53:43.353
He k in?

53:44.154 --> 53:45.155
Maybe.

53:45.656 --> 53:46.657
<i>Look, we have a plan.</i>

53:46.724 --> 53:48.101
And what does that mean?

53:48.192 --> 53:50.763
<i>It means we know what we're doing.
Get your ass down here, bitch.</i>

54:08.245 --> 54:10.247
Finn! Finn, you okay, buddy?

54:16.253 --> 54:17.960
Casual Friday.

54:19.022 --> 54:20.467
Finn, man, what's up?

54:24.762 --> 54:27.766
Jacki.

54:33.771 --> 54:35.944
I've always wanted to do that.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.051
Yeah!

54:42.880 --> 54:45.827
Have a nice day,
you miserable bastards.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.295
Finn, call me!

55:02.232 --> 55:04.610
My friend is running
the fastest Mustang in the world

55:04.668 --> 55:05.806
at De Leon on Sunday

55:05.903 --> 55:07.974
and the setup is all wrong.

55:09.239 --> 55:11.685
I'm in accounting.

55:12.743 --> 55:15.155
Don't you feel like you're dying inside?

55:15.312 --> 55:16.518
Yes.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.860
It's cold in here.

55:31.128 --> 55:32.664
Where's the Beast?

55:33.197 --> 55:34.540
What the hell?

55:34.698 --> 55:35.938
- Where are your clothes?
- Did you miss this?

55:36.099 --> 55:37.942
No, I didn't miss it.
Don't touch me, man.

55:38.101 --> 55:39.808
Stay away! We gotta go, let's go.

55:39.870 --> 55:40.940
You missed me, didn't you?

55:41.138 --> 55:42.640
No. Get off!

55:43.707 --> 55:45.983
<i>We got the shaved bird.
We're jumping in the Beast.</i>

55:46.143 --> 55:48.851
We're behind.
We got 28 hours to get to Cali.

55:48.946 --> 55:50.016
Copy that.

55:50.113 --> 55:51.717
- Good morning.
- Oh, my God.

55:51.815 --> 55:53.624
So, why the hell are you naked?

55:53.684 --> 55:55.186
To make sure I'd never come back.

55:55.285 --> 55:56.628
I'm sure you could've
done that another way.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.497
Let's be clear, though,
you're not wearing my underwear.

56:07.130 --> 56:09.974
There's a helicopter
in the middle of the street.

56:15.806 --> 56:16.876
Hello?

56:16.974 --> 56:19.978
<i>WNKW with a question
for Tobey Marshall.</i>

56:20.143 --> 56:23.556
On a scale from one to ten,
how crazy hot is your passenger?

56:25.082 --> 56:27.858
Like my new wheels? Bitchin', right?

56:30.087 --> 56:31.657
What happened to the Cessna?

56:31.822 --> 56:33.529
<i>Flight restrictions in the city, man.</i>

56:33.690 --> 56:35.770
<i>But it's all good.
I borrowed my buddy's little bird.</i>

56:35.926 --> 56:37.030
<i>Let me get a hard right.</i>

56:48.338 --> 56:50.258
<i>Y'all lucky, I almost got
my hands on that Apache</i>

56:50.407 --> 56:51.886
from Great Lakes Army Air Base,

56:51.942 --> 56:54.388
but Colonel Gatins
was sweating me hard.

56:54.678 --> 56:55.748
Here we go again.

56:56.013 --> 56:57.458
<i>Not talking to you, Beast.</i>

57:02.619 --> 57:04.462
Roger that, Liar One.

57:04.621 --> 57:06.191
Finn, you're back in the crew
for all of 10 minutes

57:06.256 --> 57:08.361
and you're already
up my skirt talking shit.

57:08.525 --> 57:10.806
Man, you're gonna rue the day
you started calling me that.

57:13.797 --> 57:16.107
What, did you
all of a sudden go to college, fool?

57:16.266 --> 57:18.303
Wow. What a really
ignorant thing to say.

57:18.468 --> 57:20.744
<i>God, are you ignorant.</i>

57:20.938 --> 57:22.781
Is it gonna be like this the entire way?

57:27.945 --> 57:31.620
<i>A reminder, the Motown Marathon
races through town this weekend...</i>

57:32.115 --> 57:33.788
Romeo, stand by.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.761
Standing by.

57:36.920 --> 57:39.628
But for today's traffic,
we go live to Romeo

57:39.723 --> 57:41.396
in the Channel 10 traffic helicopter.

57:41.558 --> 57:43.469
<i>- How are we looking, Romeo?</i>
- Cut <i>to two.</i>

57:44.227 --> 57:45.763
<i>Bum</i>

57:45.929 --> 57:48.239
<i>Bum, bum, bum, bum!</i>

57:48.398 --> 57:50.309
Ls Romeo in the helicopter'?
What's going on?

57:50.467 --> 57:52.140
<i>Bum, bum</i>

57:52.235 --> 57:53.737
<i>Looking good, Beth.</i>

57:54.137 --> 57:55.810
Real good.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.253
Commercial! Hey, cut to commercial!

57:59.409 --> 58:01.446
Hey, Liar One, eyes on the road.

58:01.678 --> 58:03.487
Wow!

58:04.081 --> 58:05.287
I did not see that.

58:08.752 --> 58:11.130
<i>5-Charlie, Igor
ops on the silver Mustang.</i>

58:11.188 --> 58:13.532
<i>I'm in pursuit. Westbound Jefferson.</i>

58:13.623 --> 58:14.931
<i>Copy, 7-Charlie.</i>

58:15.092 --> 58:17.436
<i>We'll stop him
before he gets on the 375.</i>

58:39.449 --> 58:41.554
All right, Beauty,
this is gonna sound insane,

58:41.651 --> 58:44.611
but I need a two-lane grasshopper
in order to get these guys off your back.

58:44.654 --> 58:46.156
- Roger.
- What's a grasshopper?

58:46.323 --> 58:48.360
You may wanna
close your eyes for this.

58:49.126 --> 58:50.469
Is it worse than "Bus, bus, bus"?

58:55.532 --> 58:57.512
<i>All right. Now, just aim for the trees.</i>

59:00.137 --> 59:01.241
Spread your wings, Beauty!

59:32.035 --> 59:34.447
What just happened? You're amazing.

59:34.604 --> 59:36.106
<i>I can'! believe were alive.</i>

59:36.273 --> 59:38.844
Okay, got to go. Time's up in the bird.

59:39.276 --> 59:42.257
<i>That was amazing. You're amazing.</i>

59:42.412 --> 59:43.789
We are amazing.

59:43.947 --> 59:47.622
<i>All units, please be advised,

59:47.717 --> 59:49.890
<i>Need to contact State for air support.</i>

59:50.854 --> 59:52.561
<i>Stale dispatch status on Arrow One.</i>

59:52.622 --> 59:54.363

<i>Arrow One en route. ETA is in five.</i>

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:27.234
Liar One, are you tracking
that air bear heading to I-94?

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.969
If he spots me, it's game over.
We're gonna need to switch to plan B.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.734
<i>Plan B adds an hour to the trig.</i>

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.901
No choice, we're gonna
have to make up that time.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.069
<i>Roger that. Plan B it is.</i>

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.840
Beauty will go bingo on that route,

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:40.312
so we're gonna have
to hot fuel and top off.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:42.440
Hot fuel, coming up!

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:44.243
Get out there, skinny boy.

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.946
You were checking me out!

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.317
What?

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.297
"Bingo" and "hot fuel"...

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:00.434
We're refueling without stopping.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.092
So why don't you just say that?

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:07.442
Well, I mean, I guess I could, but...

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.132
What are you doing?

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.163
Helping-

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:41.900
What?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.138
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.038
Shit!

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.179
Steady!

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.259
Closer!

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:10.232
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.571
I got this!

01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:19.703
Go inside!

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:25.380
The hits just keep on
coming with you, huh?

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:28.047
Never judge a girl by her Gucci boots.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:29.379
Her what?

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.192
High heels.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.354
Why don't you just say that?

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:37.520
Nice.

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.765
Hey, Beast, take the shoulder,
I'll go with you.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:41.530
Roger that, Beauty.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.563
<i>All units be advised,</i>

I need eyes on that bear

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.371
What's your 20?

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:56.046
Still on the ground, Beauty.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.716
Come on, Susan.

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:04.484
Don't let me down, baby. Come on...

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.656
Yeah!

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.290

We're clear.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:33.015
Yeah, yeah!

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.186
<i>Thanks, boys!</i>

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:41.862

<i>Beauty, you are safe and sound.</i>

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.329

Yeah, well, you sped it up
with your little stunt in Detroit.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.203

No, not just that.

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:13.518
Kids, I'm looking at something
that I can't quite believe.

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.414
I mean, my inbox is white hot.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.581
I got a bunch of trolls
sending me footage

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.127
of something that is mind-blowing.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:26.924
I'm looking at footage
of a car that supposedly disappeared.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:33.940
That's the same car
that Ford and Shelby were building

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.304
when Carroll died.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:38.937
<i>Fm looking at a gorgeous ghost.</i>

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.147
<i>And I think that's

<i>driving a chariot of the gods.</i>

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.627

Tobey Marshall doing something
stupid and reckless again?

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:19.652
Didn't that guy just get out
of prison for manslaughter?

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:23.256
Whoa! Dino, Dino' bambino.
Hey, accidents happen in racing.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:26.189
<i>Nobody knows that better
than you, Dino, remember?</i>

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.754
I just don't wanna

Wait a minute,
did you just say what I think you said?

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.672
That car is one of three in the world.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:51.342
<i>You're willing to give away

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.255
Really? Okay.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.917
We got a girl with a fake British accent,

<i>Having a spot of tea, are you, dove?</i>

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:22.532
There were three cars in the race
the day that Pete died, that's a fact.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.442
And anyone that says
that Tobey is responsible

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.604
for Pete's death, answer this.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:28.613
Why jump parole in New York

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:31.652
knowing that you are going to be
re-arrested and do serious time,

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:34.779
unless you are innocent
and hell-bent to right a wrong?

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.723

why would he risk it'?

Yeah, the British are coming.
I gotta tell you, I'm moved. lam.

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:14.518
The whole thing just went

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:17.095
I gotta pop one of these.

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:18.254
Yeah.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.425
This is getting good.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:23.533

<i>Tobey Marshall versus Dino Brewster.</i>

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:29.939
That's a deep rivalry right there.

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:34.444
Yeah. I hear you, honey. I hear you.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:37.207
The two of you out there,

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.877
flying across the country
at killer speeds to prove something

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.388
while you're tearing up
the American asphalt.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:45.788
Born to run, baby. Born to run.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.788
<i>Tobey Marsha“,</i>

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.497
<i>welcome to the De Leon.</i>

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:02.137
That's it, cretins,

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.300
De Leon is full.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.072
But if you want
Dino Brewster's Lamborghini,

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:10.208
you're gonna have to
chase down that Mustang to get it.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:11.741
Wow.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.346
The race before the race.

01:10:15.478 --> 01:10:17.185
I love it.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.256
<i>Beauty!</i>

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:30.057
Congrats on the wild card
to the rodeo, my friend.

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:32.957
<i>Your mute is clear
to the Nebraska border.</i>

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.294
<i>Darkness is upon us,</i>

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.392
<i>so the eyes in the sky
will be shut for</i> a <i>while.</i>

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.598
<i>But I'm gonna leapfrog ahead
and meet you guys at Record Breaker.</i>

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.273
What's your 20, Liar One?

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:42.903
<i>Flat-netting you, bitch!</i>

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.176
<i>Special delivery.</i>

01:11:49.272 --> 01:11:51.513
<i>I hope you ladies didn't soil
your panties down there.</i>

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:52.728
I hate it when he does that!

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.483
That's what I thought.
Keep talking that shit.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.921
Nice to see
you haven't changed, nimrod.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.821
Okay, listen.
I don't know who "nimrod" is,

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:01.759
but I'm pretty sure he lived in the '50s.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:05.024
All right? My handle is Maverick.

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.264
<i>You better ask somebody.</i>

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.349
Hey, make it fast,
we're two hours behind schedule.

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:26.442
Okay, I got this.

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.596
Large coffee, please.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.133
- Cream and sugar'?
- No, just black.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.601
Yeah. I can't talk. I know.

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:51.531
Excuse me, miss.
Can I ask you a few questions?

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:53.901
<i>Why, of course you can,</i>

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.067
<i>Officer Lejeune.</i>

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:58.212
<i>How can I help you'!?</i>

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.047
Do you live in the area?

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:04.480
No, sir. We're actually just long hauling.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.642
Where from?

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.755
From south to north.

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:11.587
So we actually started in Louisiana.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.455
So you are not traveling in
that silver Mustang out from?

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.390
Mustang?

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:21.330
What, like the horse?

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.628
No, sir. No.

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:27.073
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:30.176
If you'd step out to my cruiser,
shouldn't take but a minute.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.472
Stop!

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:43.484
Stop right there!

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.966
Tobey? He's following me.

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:55.798
<i>I know. Where ave you'!?</i>

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:57.166
I'm upstairs. I'm in a room.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.101
All right, is there a window?

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.369
It's on the second floor.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.467
Open up this door!

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.013
Look, just climb out the window.
I'll come get you.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:08.173
<i>Okay-</i>

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:11.114
I'm gonna tell you one more time,
open up this door!

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:17.655
Any units in the area? Over.

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:20.958
Ma'am, other units are on their way.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:27.123
Where are you?

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:38.501
Hey, you gotta jump. Let's go.

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:40.308
No, I can't jump. I'm afraid of heights.

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.182
It's not high. Come on.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.742
No, I can't. I'm afraid of heights.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.921
- I don't know what to do!
- Just trust me. Sit down.

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.148
Okay? Sit down.

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.718
Just close your eyes and count to three.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.260
All right? On three.

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:56.726
One, two...

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:06.738
<i>Unit 445, there are no other
units available at this time.</i>

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:11.603
Copy that.
In pursuit of the silver Mustang.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.193
Where is he?

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:38.869
He's not coming.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.268
Are you sure?

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:43.974
Trust me.

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:48.913
Hey, you know...

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:53.152
That was really impressive back there.

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:56.220
I just thought you should know.

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:06.061
Hey, do you think
you could drive for a few hours?

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.664
Let's just... Let's switch.

01:17:14.497 --> 01:17:15.999
It's all right.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.474
Okay, steady.

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.639
There you go.

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.975
All right, don't kill us.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:37.657
That's nice.

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:39.929
Have you got her'?

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.593
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:44.832
Good.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.637
Good, good, good.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.220
Jesus!

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.320
That was on purpose.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:46.731
Yeah, thanks to Dino's bounty.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:50.830
They're coming at you.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:53.833
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:57.008
Wait, wait. See?
They're trying to trap us.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.340
Here, just drift onto the shoulder.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.880
No, no, no, I'm going for the Hummer.

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.412
He's a pavement prowler.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:02.538
Pavement what?

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.949
It's a show car with a big lift kit.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.520
It makes up for his inferiority complex.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:13.849
Wait. Are you crazy?

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.723
Wait, wait! Whoa, whoa!

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.025
Whoa! Jesus!

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.608
You are crazy!

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.275
Nice. Nice, nice.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.548
No, keep it straight!

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.051
Holy shit.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.393
Okay, Larry, bring it.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.725
<i>Go! it. We're moving out.</i>

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.468
Shoot the tires, but don't kill them.

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:04.838
All right. Now, when I say,

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:07.345
you're gonna let up on the gas
and you're gonna make a hard left.

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:08.437
- OKay?
- OKay

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:09.504
- Okay!
- Okay.

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:10.948
Your instincts are gonna say...

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.007
Just do it!

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:14.579
Now!

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:24.820
Don't let up.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.109
Blast those buggers.
We'll get them on the split.

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.679
Hey, Liar One, you got your ears on?

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:51.514
Son of a bitch!

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:54.521
We need to find another road.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.521
Liar One, we need you!

01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:07.973
You gotta go faster.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:11.978
No, two hands on the wheel!

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:23.149
Shit!

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.566
Liar One, is that you?

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:41.334
Hook up, hook up!

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:49.513
Sergeant Jackson,
this is not what we discussed.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.182
Sir, will you relax? Okay?

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.686
I got this.

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:01.887
We're good!

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.590
You gotta tell me you believe I can
fly an Apache helicopter, man.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.029
<i>What?
- I'm serious, hm.</i>

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.296
<i>You're always trying to play me.</i>

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:11.131
<i>Tell me you believe I can ﬂy
an Apache helicopter.</i>

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.967
Tell him whatever he wants!

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.870
Yeah, you can ﬂy an Apache helicopter!

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:16.404
And my handle is Maverick.

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:18.093
Gotta call me Maverick, let me hear it.

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.040
Maverick! Maverick!

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.542
Maverick!

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.707
Was that so bad?

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.109
Shit!

01:22:25.207 --> 01:22:26.311
Benny!

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:32.749
Holy shit!

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.969
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Julia, hey!

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:51.404
Look at me.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:54.304
Just breathe. Breathe.

01:22:56.572 --> 01:22:58.279
Good.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:04.920
Look into my eyes.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.017
Look into my eyes. Good.

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:10.258
What color are they?

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.191
They're really blue.

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:16.436
They're really blue. Good, good.

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:19.267
They're a lot bluer than yours.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.966
- No!
- Yes, they are.

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.700
- They're not!
- Yes!

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:24.141
They're not bluer!

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.440
- Admit it!
- Mine are bluer!

01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:29.647
- Oh, God!
- Wow.

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:33.880
Benny! Don't drop us!

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:34.977
What?

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:37.380
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:23:37.613 --> 01:23:39.320
I'm kidding. We're good, we're good.

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:51.827
What the hell is that?

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.213
Yeah!

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:10.914
Yeah!

01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:13.015
Yeah, Tobey!

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.355
Hey, Benny!

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:16.323
We believe you, baby!

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:18.422
We believe you, Maverick!

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:24.501
Look at me, bitches!

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:25.899
We're good!

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:27.529
Yeah!

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:30.769
Go!

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:40.614
Are you guys Okay?

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:41.710
Yeah.

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:51.557
<i>Major Davis,
you are in violation of your ﬂight plan.</i>

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.621
My bad.

01:24:52.955 --> 01:24:55.458
<i>Return that bird to base immediately.</i>

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:59.227
Looks like I'm gonna have
to go away for a while, y'all.

01:24:59.361 --> 01:25:01.363
But Benny always comes back.

01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:06.972
Godspeed, boys. Godspeed.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.472
You're 23 minutes late.

01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:18.665
- Are you checking in, sir'?
<i>- I'll</i> be right back.

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:40.971
I'm surprised you made it.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.507
I'm impressed.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.174
What's going on in
that head of yours, Tobey?

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:52.151
You never went back for him.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.552
I wasn't there,

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:58.253
remember'?

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:02.052
I was there to comfort
Anita at the funeral.

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.754
Such a sweet, innocent girl.

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:10.494
Do you wanna do this here?

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.704
Because one of us is on parole.

01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:19.335
But you know that, right?

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:30.346
We'll settle this behind the wheel.

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:34.420
I'm not worried about
you behind the wheel.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:36.018
Really?

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:39.726
Why did you put a bounty on me?

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.759
Tomorrow is gonna be fun.

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:44.866
Yeah.

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:48.430
When you're hanging
upside down tomorrow,

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:50.134
I'm not coming back for you.

01:27:52.868 --> 01:27:55.075
Watch yourself, Tobey.

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.141
See you tomorrow.

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.756
You ran into him, didn't you?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.027
You need to forget about it.

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.525
You need to lei it go.

01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:55.800
I think you need to get out of the car.

01:28:55.864 --> 01:28:58.936
And you need a hot shower,
and you need a good meal,

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:03.143
and some rest, and some food.

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:09.016
And I'm going to book you a hotel room.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:14.050
No, I think it's best if you
just stay with me tonight.

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:24.063
You know, it's just safer...

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:25.399
If you stay with me.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.205
Right? Yeah.

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:49.352
Look at you. Okay.

01:30:44.306 --> 01:30:45.785
<i>Beast,</i>

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:47.815
<i>we've been hit.</i>

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.710
All right, we're on our way.
We're on our way.

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.121
- Track them.
- I'm on it.

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:52.247
Where is he?

01:30:52.414 --> 01:30:54.174
He's up on California and Mason.
Make a left.

01:30:57.719 --> 01:30:58.891
Are you okay?

01:31:02.157 --> 01:31:06.902
Go. Before the cops get here, go.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:09.836
God!

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:25.352
I got you. I got you.

01:31:25.914 --> 01:31:28.485
<i>Units, be advised,

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.138
Holy shit.

01:31:44.933 --> 01:31:46.037
Open the door. We gotta let them in.

01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:47.695
- We gotta make this quick.
- All right.

01:31:50.105 --> 01:31:52.711
Yo, we gotta move. Cops are coming.

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.285
Came in over the scanner. We gotta go!

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:55.616
Come on, man.

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:57.017
We gotta go.

01:31:58.847 --> 01:31:59.985
Tobey, you guys good?

01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:01.559
We need a hospital.

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.917
- Find a hospital. Find a hospital.
- I'm working on it.

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:10.129
All right, I got a hospital on Hill.
Make a left.

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.849
Wait! We need your help.

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.424
What's her name?
Did she ever lose consciousness?

01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:36.155
Julia. Yeah, she's been in and out.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.157
- You stay with her, all right?
- I will.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.332
- Take care of her.
- Come on. We gotta go.

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:44.159
- Go, go, go.
- We're here.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.063
Anita,

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.934
why don't you just leave him?

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:03.682
I just did.

01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:17.423
I know that Dino was there
the night my brother died.

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:20.361
Yeah. He was.

01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:24.463
I wish I could give you
those years back.

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:28.437
Anita,

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.633
I need a car.

01:34:51.386 --> 01:34:53.059
I'm sorry, Tobey.

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.466
So am I.

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:02.698
Why wouldn't he destroy it?

01:36:03.925 --> 01:36:05.370
I have no idea.

01:36:05.727 --> 01:36:09.539
I guess some people
just don't think they'll ever get caught.

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:50.838
How is she?

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:56.453
Arm is broke. Waiting on the CAT scan.

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:48.004
He'!-

01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:52.801
How you feeling?

01:37:59.474 --> 01:38:01.078
Beat up.

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.580
But I'm fine.

01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:10.823
You know...

01:38:12.487 --> 01:38:14.489
You are not the girl I thought you were.

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:20.038
Well, you learn a lot about a person
when they've been hit by a truck.

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:32.013
What are you gonna do
about tomorrow?

01:38:33.508 --> 01:38:35.579
I found a car.

01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:41.422
Do I wanna know
where you found the car?

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:43.960
No, you don't.

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:45.961
Is it fast?

01:38:46.788 --> 01:38:49.234
It's fast enough, yeah.

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.041
Do it for Pete.

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:03.538
What?

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:09.918
This is for Pete.

01:39:17.552 --> 01:39:18.997
Yeah.

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:57.826
This is, by far, the best De Leon
I've ever put together.

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:01.099
<i>This is my David, man.
This is my Pieta.</i>

01:40:01.596 --> 01:40:03.473
This is my Soup Can.

01:40:11.272 --> 01:40:13.149
Is it possible to get a laptop?

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:15.050
Sure. I'll be right back.

01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:31.702
Hey, what's up, baby?
What's your name?

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:34.529
Right.

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:38.076
Do you have an iPad
I can borrow? Please?

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:42.874
<i>We've got our lineup.</i>

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:45.143
<i>Each driver takes his spot
at the starting line.</i>

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:48.148
<i>In the first row is
English Paul in</i> a <i>Bugatti Veyron</i>

01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:50.587
<i>and Dino Brewster
in his Lamborghini Elemento.</i>

01:40:51.012 --> 01:40:54.016
Row two is the Gooch in a Saleen S7.

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:56.584
<i>Texas Mike is in the McLaren P1.</i>

01:40:56.684 --> 01:40:59.995
<i>The third row has Johnny V
in his GTA Spam.</i>

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:04.859
I'm looking at $7 million in cars

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:08.199
and thousands of horsepower.
Winner takes all.

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:11.376
Losers, y'all can walk home.

01:41:14.769 --> 01:41:16.214
<i>No sign of Tobey Marshall.</i>

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.342
<i>I don't really know
what all that's about, but</i> I...

01:41:19.407 --> 01:41:21.250
<i>Hold up. Wait, hold on.</i>

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:29.122
Wait a minute, now.

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:32.595
A sixth car has just
arrived, but I can't...

01:41:44.899 --> 01:41:48.745
<i>Tobey Marshall just stepped out of
a red Agera.</i>

01:41:50.071 --> 01:41:52.551
Well! Maybe the little tart was right

01:41:52.974 --> 01:41:57.889
about there being three Koenigseggs
the day Pete died.

01:42:19.834 --> 01:42:23.304
You like the car I brought?
Because I know the cops will.

01:42:25.573 --> 01:42:27.985
And by the way,

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.748
I think this belongs to you.

01:43:45.086 --> 01:43:47.692
<i>Tobey Marshall and Johnny V
are battling for fifth.</i>

01:43:47.822 --> 01:43:49.222
You got it, you got it, you got it.

01:43:55.496 --> 01:43:56.998
<i>And Johnny V is of! the maxi.</i>

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.338
Come on, come on, come on!

01:44:40.875 --> 01:44:43.116
<i>Golden Gate, this is H1.
I got ops on them.</i>

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:44.314
<i>Westbound 128.</i>

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:51.726
Tobey Marshall's gonna roll the dice
and try to split the Saleen and the P1.

01:45:00.094 --> 01:45:01.334
- Yo, yo, yo.
- And he does it.

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:02.907
Yo, that's my dude right there.
That's my dude.

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:04.306
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Y'all come check this out.

01:45:04.398 --> 01:45:06.503
Marshall's balls have just been located

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.137
and they are very, very large.

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:13.241
<i>Texas Mike in the McLaren is now fifth,
Tobey is now running fourth.</i>

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:16.650
<i>Dino Brewster, you better
watch your ass, son.</i>

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:25.457
Suspects approaching
150 miles per hour.

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.123
H1 will try to stall them.

01:45:27.588 --> 01:45:29.499
<i>All units, 10-3.</i>

01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:35.600
I've got flying cops.
I've got ﬂies in the ointment.

01:45:35.863 --> 01:45:38.469
<i>I got CHP in the air all over the course.</i>

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:40.375
<i>You add cops to the race
and people</i> get...

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:43.140
<i>Racers should race,
cops should eat donuts.</i>

01:46:04.325 --> 01:46:07.534
<i>Ail units, disregard the spike strips.
They're moving tun fast,.</i>

01:46:07.628 --> 01:46:08.698
They'll get past the deployment spot.

01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:10.366
Let's try the rolling block instead.

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:11.636
<i>73-4. roger?</i>

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:13.804
<i>18-2, six on Code 3.</i>

01:46:13.868 --> 01:46:16.075
Rolling block in formation, check.

01:46:55.910 --> 01:47:00.359
The Gooch in the Saleen
has been totally taken out.

01:47:00.748 --> 01:47:02.625
<i>I cam believe what Fm seeing.</i>

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:06.431
<i>British Paul holds first,
Dino is still in second,</i>

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.897
<i>Tobey Marshall moves into third.</i>

01:47:08.055 --> 01:47:09.363
Yeah, boy.

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:10.934
All right, brother, keep it going.

01:47:11.959 --> 01:47:15.031
<i>Dispatch, officers involved in TC.
I need rescue, now.</i>

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:32.051
<i>Al! units, they TC'd
into two of our officers.</i>

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:38.558
<i>Be advised, five suspect vehicles
are entering the tree line.</i>

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:40.895
<i>Consider using lethal force.</i>

01:47:41.055 --> 01:47:42.500
They're at mile marker 27.

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:45.957
<i>Dispatch, confirm rescue is rolling.</i>
We <i>have another officer down</i>

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.660
as well as another suspect.
18-5, are you set up for the pit?

01:48:49.123 --> 01:48:50.864
18-5 in position.

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:09.016
Suspects approaching on a five count.

01:49:09.076 --> 01:49:10.680
18-5, countdown begins.

01:49:13.814 --> 01:49:14.815
<i>Five,</i>

01:49:16.817 --> 01:49:17.818
<i>four,</i>

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.421
<i>three,</i>

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:22.493
two,

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:24.024
One.

01:49:45.279 --> 01:49:47.725
<i>18-5, perfect pit. Lead suspect down.</i>

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:52.394
I'm hearing over scanners,
the Bugatti has just got taken out.

01:49:52.453 --> 01:49:54.126
Man. Wait a minute...

01:49:54.888 --> 01:49:58.301
Wait a minute, Tobey Marshall has
somehow just taken the lead.

01:49:58.392 --> 01:50:01.396
<i>Dino Brewster is running last
in third place?</i>

01:50:02.029 --> 01:50:04.407
- Are you kidding me?
- Hold that lead! Hold that lead!

01:50:05.466 --> 01:50:06.877
And then there were three.

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:09.247
<i>We need containment
set at Navarro Bridge.</i>

01:50:21.582 --> 01:50:25.621
<i>H1, Mendo PD
is Code 3 to Navarro Bridge.</i>

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.458
They're coming up
to the race marker to the bridge.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.972
<i>Tobey is clearly running first.
I can't believe it.</i>

01:50:36.063 --> 01:50:39.636
<i>The blue collar kid from Mount Kisco
is trying to wear Cinderella's slipper.</i>

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:42.077
That's my dude! Mount Kisco, let's go!

01:50:57.284 --> 01:51:00.959
<i>By the way, these cop cars,
they top out at about 130.</i>

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.796
Hold them back, baby! Hold them back.

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:05.663
Good luck catching up, Smokey.
I'll tell you who wins.

01:51:36.857 --> 01:51:38.131
Come on!

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:03.822
<i>Dispatch, another suspect is down.</i>

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:05.488
<i>Only two remaining.</i>

01:52:09.423 --> 01:52:12.233
<i>The Elemento just ﬂicked
the P1 into a roll.</i>

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:16.372
<i>We're down to Tobey Marshall
and Dino Brewster.</i>

01:52:18.232 --> 01:52:19.768
This ain't just about racing.

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:53.033
Don't do it. Tobey, don't let him do it.

01:53:19.326 --> 01:53:21.932
Tobey Marshall just let
the Elemento get by him.

01:53:21.995 --> 01:53:23.269
<i>- Nice move.
- That kid better wake up.</i>

01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:24.673
<i>Wake up, Tobey!</i>

01:53:24.765 --> 01:53:29.236
Wake up and smell
that $2 million Lambo in your pocket.

01:54:01.935 --> 01:54:04.882
Don't do it, brother.
It's not worth it. You can beat him.

01:54:10.811 --> 01:54:13.451
Pete... I need you, pal.

01:54:23.457 --> 01:54:24.629
Okay, let's go.

01:54:58.358 --> 01:55:02.829
<i>Jeez, Dino took a swing and missed
and ﬂipped the Elemento.</i>

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:06.870
<i>Dino Brewster is out Down goes Dino!</i>

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:09.513
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

01:55:09.569 --> 01:55:12.550
<i>Tobey is the last man standing!
He's gonna win the De Leon!</i>

01:55:12.606 --> 01:55:14.108
He's gonna win the De Leon!

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:17.517
The Marshall kid from Mount Kisco!
He's gonna make a milk run to victory!

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:19.887
That's right! That's my boy!
That's my dude!

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.857
That's right. Give me space.
I'm about to twerk it out.

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:23.258
<i>Tobey is the last man standing!</i>

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:25.956
- Get <i>it. Hit it, hit it.
- He's gonna win the De Leon!</i>

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:27.690
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:30.792
The kid from Mount Kisco!
The blue collar kid!

01:55:48.742 --> 01:55:50.483
Wait! Wait.

01:55:50.577 --> 01:55:51.749
What are you doing?

01:55:51.812 --> 01:55:53.572
- What are you doing?
- Why are you stopping?

01:56:19.773 --> 01:56:21.514
Come on, Come on.

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.116
Come on.

01:56:31.451 --> 01:56:32.930
Hey, you okay?

01:56:32.986 --> 01:56:36.092
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:40.298
I'm fine.

01:56:40.794 --> 01:56:42.967
Good. This is for Pete.

01:58:10.517 --> 01:58:12.019
Let me see your hands!

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:19.065
Let me see your hands!

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:20.260
Now!

01:59:03.403 --> 01:59:05.747
Stand up! Keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:10.148
<i>18-7, Euro plates
Sam-Mary-Harry, 22-8,</i>

01:59:10.243 --> 01:59:12.018
<i>registered to</i> a <i>Dino Brewster.</i>

01:59:12.112 --> 01:59:14.285
Well, now, hold on, cretins.

01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:18.129
I'm hearing over the scanners
that the Koenigsegg

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.289
does indeed belong to Dino

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:22.594
and that's the missing evidence
that killed Pete.

01:59:25.125 --> 01:59:27.332
Well, then it looks
like Dino, Dino bambino

01:59:27.427 --> 01:59:30.499
is going away for a long, longtime.

02:00:17.744 --> 02:00:20.350
Well, kiddos, it looks like Tobey himself

02:00:20.413 --> 02:00:22.586
is gonna enjoy three hots
and a cot in the pokey

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:24.491
for illegal street racing.

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:27.721
I don't know, Tobey.

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:31.601
A few months in jail
to prove your innocence.

02:00:33.693 --> 02:00:35.434
<i>Was it worth ii, kid?</i>

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:12.566
All right. Step forward.

02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:01.750
Get in!

02:02:02.115 --> 02:02:03.651
I'll drive.

02:02:03.917 --> 02:02:06.659
I've seen you drive and it's terrifying.

02:02:11.758 --> 02:02:13.169
<i>Come on, lovebirds.</i>

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.330
<i>We need to get Benny out of the clink.</i>

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:17.305
<i>Maverick is getting out
for good behavior.</i>

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:19.502
<i>Yeah, apparently he started
some fitness program</i>

02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:21.044
<i>for the inmates or some shit.</i>

02:02:21.134 --> 02:02:22.613
<i>We got five hours to get to Utah.</i>

02:02:22.936 --> 02:02:24.006
<i>Let's go.</i>

02:02:54.734 --> 02:02:56.338
Yeah.

02:02:56.402 --> 02:02:58.348
Yeah, that's right, baby.

02:02:58.404 --> 02:02:59.906
You're rocking with the champ.

02:03:00.006 --> 02:03:02.213
You're rocking with the champ.
Number one.

02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:05.152
Don't even call me Maverick no more.
Call me Benny the Champ.

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:07.384
That's right, baby.
That's good, Jeff. I see you, Jeff.

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.393
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Gerald?

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:11.723
Twerk!

02:03:11.818 --> 02:03:14.025
You know what? You got a solo.
Come on over here.

02:03:14.087 --> 02:03:16.590
Let's see the solo, bro.
Let's see the solo.

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:19.226
Get it, Gerald! Get it, bro!

02:03:22.028 --> 02:03:23.837
That's what I'm talking about, bro! Yes!
