00:31.916 --> 00:36.454
What is destiny?

00:36.488 --> 00:40.991
Is it a predetermined path
between point A and B?

00:43.828 --> 00:48.733
or is it just a culmination of
all our individual decisions.

00:51.603 --> 00:53.872
I am not a man with grand
purpose.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.408
I'm simply a man who made a
decision.

01:00.945 --> 01:02.780
A decision to do something
different.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.752
No worldwide problems to solve.

01:12.222 --> 01:15.894
I did it because I thought I
could.

04:57.115 --> 04:58.950
Day 127.

05:04.489 --> 05:05.456
Morale is high.

05:06.858 --> 05:09.927
This house is quite
charming and comfortable.

05:18.636 --> 05:21.172
Everything so far has
gone according to plan.

05:22.039 --> 05:23.941
Staying busy helps keep my mind

05:23.975 --> 05:26.309
off of how isolated it can be
here.

05:27.310 --> 05:30.347
I'm really satisfied with the
progress that I've been making

05:30.380 --> 05:31.849
and hope it continues.

05:34.218 --> 05:36.419
I feel like I'm on the
verge of solving the problem

05:36.454 --> 05:38.022
that's keeping me here.

05:39.524 --> 05:41.993
The tools of this time
are just so primitive.

06:22.066 --> 06:23.501
I'm forced to ignore

06:23.534 --> 06:26.170
almost a century of
technological advancements.

06:27.605 --> 06:30.608
I do, however, enjoy the
challenge this presents me.

06:45.690 --> 06:48.926
Day 463.

06:49.927 --> 06:52.897
This work is taking much
longer than I had anticipated.

06:54.232 --> 06:55.733
Every breakthrough has been
coupled

06:55.766 --> 06:57.568
with at least two more setbacks

06:58.636 --> 07:00.338
and what originally felt like
progress

07:00.370 --> 07:03.406
is really nothing more than a
dead end.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.576
I feel as if I'm getting
nowhere.

07:07.211 --> 07:09.280
My life has become a rhythm.

07:10.248 --> 07:13.751
An endless loop of the same
thing, day in and day out.

07:15.586 --> 07:17.387
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening

07:17.420 --> 07:19.123
outside of these four walls,

07:20.758 --> 07:22.994
but I can't let myself think
that way.

07:35.973 --> 07:37.975
I must keep going.

07:38.009 --> 07:39.677
I have to make this work.

07:41.145 --> 07:43.314
Getting back home is all I have.

07:45.316 --> 07:46.851
There is nothing else.

08:29.293 --> 08:31.696
Today is the day it all ends.

08:33.998 --> 08:39.003
Despite all of my best efforts,
everything has been in vain.

08:41.405 --> 08:43.174
My will is broken.

08:45.676 --> 08:48.179
I don't know if it's the
limitations of technology

08:48.212 --> 08:52.016
that are available to me
in this time or my own.

08:54.218 --> 08:57.688
Either way, I know I'll
never be going home.

08:59.256 --> 09:02.727
The simple truth is that
I leave this world alone.

09:03.728 --> 09:04.895
No family.

09:06.597 --> 09:08.933
I shut out the only friend I
had.

09:12.003 --> 09:15.539
No one will ever know of the
things I have accomplished

09:16.774 --> 09:19.844
or even of my failures and
mistakes.

09:23.714 --> 09:26.183
This is the only decision I have
left.

09:28.619 --> 09:31.889
I can only hope this will
cause no further damage.

09:34.225 --> 09:38.529
I thought time travel would
be exciting, liberating,

09:39.630 --> 09:43.701
but in the end it was just
escaping

09:43.734 --> 09:46.303
one prison to enter another.

09:55.579 --> 09:59.417
I've done everything I can do.

10:08.125 --> 10:11.662
I don't know what else I could
do,

10:15.467 --> 10:18.169
I've tried.

10:19.570 --> 10:21.072
I've tried.

10:26.610 --> 10:29.814
But I'm not doing this anymore.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.169
Suit power at full
capacity

15:19.203 --> 15:20.938
facility diagnostics complete.

15:20.971 --> 15:22.406
A.N.I. system online.

15:22.439 --> 15:23.941
Hello A.N.I.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.275
Good afternoon.

15:25.309 --> 15:27.311
Your day is finally here.

15:31.415 --> 15:32.550
You ready?

15:32.584 --> 15:34.619
All systems go.

15:34.652 --> 15:35.487
Good.

16:07.084 --> 16:09.019
Alright, start it up.

16:14.425 --> 16:16.561
Portal
polarity initiated.

16:16.594 --> 16:19.831
Beginning
count down sequence.

16:55.065 --> 16:59.504
10, 9, 8, 7, 6

17:00.404 --> 17:05.175
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

19:44.401 --> 19:46.303
Sir, are you okay?

20:24.207 --> 20:28.546
Exclusion zone
notice. Level 3 evacuation.

20:28.579 --> 20:31.348
Immediate and imminent
danger.

20:31.381 --> 20:33.584
Evacuate immediately.

20:33.618 --> 20:35.553
This is to promote
your safety.

21:33.478 --> 21:34.979
Hey, are you okay?

21:37.115 --> 21:38.983
Sir, you're bleeding everywhere.

21:39.016 --> 21:41.619
Do you want me to call for some
help?

21:41.652 --> 21:42.553
No, I'm fine.

21:42.587 --> 21:43.521
Get out of here.

21:48.826 --> 21:50.828
You know what, I'm getting
help.

21:50.862 --> 21:52.295
No need to yell at me.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.004
I said leave.

22:31.235 --> 22:32.804
Are you okay?

22:34.505 --> 22:35.540
I'm fine.

22:36.406 --> 22:38.242
Told you I'd be fine.

22:41.212 --> 22:42.046
I'm fine

24:01.424 --> 24:03.027
Just sit still.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.795
Got most of the blood cleaned
up,

24:04.829 --> 24:07.098
but you're definitely going
to want to see a doctor

24:07.131 --> 24:08.633
about some stitches.

24:08.666 --> 24:10.568
You fell and hit your head
pretty hard.

24:10.601 --> 24:13.271
Look, what are you still doing
here?

24:13.304 --> 24:15.973
I appreciate the help
but you need to just go.

24:16.007 --> 24:16.841
Fine.

24:16.874 --> 24:18.776
You know, this really isn't my
problem.

24:18.809 --> 24:21.444
But fine, if you want me to
go, I'll leave you alone.

24:21.479 --> 24:23.648
Yes, fine just go.

24:25.516 --> 24:27.551
You know, everyone living
around here

24:27.585 --> 24:29.587
thinks some lonely hermit's
living here.

24:31.589 --> 24:32.990
Is that so?

24:34.258 --> 24:36.761
Yeah and now I can see why.

24:41.431 --> 24:43.134
And that's why you're alone.

24:52.610 --> 24:54.645
I am so angry.

24:56.314 --> 24:58.182
Everything was set.

24:58.215 --> 25:01.152
I had accepted my way out of
this hell

25:02.219 --> 25:03.955
and she took it from me.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.559
I can't control anything.

25:11.529 --> 25:12.997
What do I have left?

25:15.399 --> 25:18.869
This encounter with her
triggered another episode.

25:18.903 --> 25:21.205
Visions, memories I don't know.

25:23.174 --> 25:25.076
I wish I could understand

25:27.144 --> 25:31.082
and yet all I can think about is
her.

29:00.191 --> 29:01.526
A.N.I.!

29:35.627 --> 29:37.462
Wait a minute,
did you shut me off?

29:37.495 --> 29:40.030
Have I been off for two and a
half years?

29:40.064 --> 29:41.031
Look at you.

29:41.065 --> 29:42.900
You're a mess, you're all banged
up.

29:42.933 --> 29:44.101
- I know, I know.
- I told you

29:44.134 --> 29:45.970
turning me off was a bad idea.

29:46.003 --> 29:48.372
I'm very sorry about all
that and you were right.

29:48.405 --> 29:49.773
Of course I was
right.

29:49.807 --> 29:52.477
I'm not an emotional or
irrational creature like you.

29:53.444 --> 29:55.680
Look A.N.I., I need you for
something.

29:56.847 --> 29:58.483
Um no, put me back
down.

29:58.516 --> 29:59.718
Let me charge first.

29:59.750 --> 30:00.685
You'll be fine.

30:00.719 --> 30:01.653
This won't take more
than a minute, I'm sure.

30:01.686 --> 30:04.054
After that, I'll let you bask in
the sun.

30:04.088 --> 30:05.490
How about that?

30:05.523 --> 30:07.324
Wonderful.

30:07.358 --> 30:10.261
This is what I need
you to analyze for me.

30:10.294 --> 30:11.929
What am I looking at

30:11.962 --> 30:14.164
and what's making that noise?

30:14.198 --> 30:16.433
Okay, you have to get
me closer to the source.

30:16.468 --> 30:17.835
Set me down on the sink.

30:20.838 --> 30:22.806
Okay, I hear water dripping.

30:24.275 --> 30:26.578
You know you might want
to get those pipes fixed.

30:26.611 --> 30:28.779
You have one nasty water hammer.

30:30.214 --> 30:32.349
I'm not exactly sure I know
what I'm looking for here.

30:32.383 --> 30:35.620
All I'm picking up is a natural
frequency.

30:35.654 --> 30:36.887
Sounds familiar, right?

30:38.022 --> 30:39.923
A standing wave
pattern.

30:39.957 --> 30:41.925
Hm. This solves your power
issue,

30:41.959 --> 30:43.461
but you're going to have a hard
time

30:43.495 --> 30:46.096
using early 21st century
technology.

30:46.130 --> 30:48.500
I hope you don't plan on using
sink parts.

30:48.533 --> 30:49.734
Leave that part to me.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.504
I'd recommend
shutting off the faucet

30:52.537 --> 30:54.938
before your house shakes apart.

30:54.972 --> 30:56.240
Duly noted.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.214
It's been a while, hasn't it?

32:10.247 --> 32:11.882
You've not left this
house once

32:11.915 --> 32:13.818
since I was turned off, have
you?

32:16.286 --> 32:18.956
I do believe I'm ready
to leave this place.

32:19.957 --> 32:21.892
I can imagine you
are.

32:21.925 --> 32:23.561
At least you have me again.

32:23.595 --> 32:25.463
I know you missed me.

32:25.497 --> 32:27.799
It looks like you missed
a lot of showers too.

32:29.266 --> 32:30.802
Are you taking care of yourself?

32:30.835 --> 32:31.935
A.N.I. don't start.

32:51.623 --> 32:55.259
I think we finally have
a chance this time.

32:56.326 --> 32:58.228
Our work
does seem cut out for us

32:58.262 --> 33:00.063
but I believe you're right.

33:00.097 --> 33:01.533
Okay, where do we start?

33:03.267 --> 33:04.201
Wait right here.

33:12.610 --> 33:16.113
Please tell me
you're using that for parts.

33:16.146 --> 33:18.348
Nope, he's doing what I think
he's doing.

33:18.382 --> 33:19.617
Nothing like a good song

33:19.651 --> 33:22.286
to get your creative juices
flowing, right A.N.I?

33:30.695 --> 33:32.095
While I do you
understand

33:32.129 --> 33:34.164
the merits of music for humans,

33:34.198 --> 33:36.601
I can't understand how
you call this music.

33:36.634 --> 33:38.903
Come on, this is good stuff.

33:39.838 --> 33:41.706
I'm so glad
we traveled to the past

33:41.739 --> 33:45.209
so we could listen to music
that's even further in the past.

33:45.242 --> 33:47.645
The time travel never stops.

33:47.679 --> 33:50.615
You know, if we could
get this thing working,

33:50.648 --> 33:51.816
I could arrange that.

33:52.717 --> 33:54.117
If I get
you back to the future,

33:54.151 --> 33:56.253
I get to pick the music from now
on.

33:58.756 --> 33:59.724
Deal.

34:17.775 --> 34:20.812
After being alone in
this house for so long,

34:20.844 --> 34:23.481
not making any progress on the
machine,

34:23.514 --> 34:25.516
I finally felt useful again.

34:26.885 --> 34:29.888
I forgot how much I missed
having someone to talk to.

34:50.975 --> 34:54.110
With A.N.I.'s help we made
a great break-through.

34:54.143 --> 34:56.514
I began to work feverishly
and I found myself

34:56.547 --> 34:58.115
losing track of time.

34:59.449 --> 35:01.084
The days and weeks blurred
together

35:01.118 --> 35:02.587
as our design took shape.

35:40.858 --> 35:43.126
For the first time in a very
long time,

35:44.428 --> 35:45.830
I began to believe.

35:48.866 --> 35:50.100
It felt good.

35:54.539 --> 35:55.707
It's a good start.

36:21.799 --> 36:24.602
It feels good having
something to do around here.

36:24.636 --> 36:27.071
Nobody has
perfected tea like you have.

36:28.039 --> 36:29.841
I'm curious.

36:29.874 --> 36:31.141
May I ask you something?

36:32.142 --> 36:35.546
It may be considered of a
personal nature.

36:35.580 --> 36:36.514
Sure.

36:38.315 --> 36:40.485
I didn't deem
it appropriate at the time,

36:40.518 --> 36:43.220
but now that we're making
progress.

36:45.188 --> 36:46.724
Continue.

36:46.758 --> 36:48.358
You have not
once mentioned the injuries

36:48.392 --> 36:50.160
you have sustained to your head.

36:50.193 --> 36:52.195
I also analyze the basement and
detected

36:52.229 --> 36:54.465
a small explosive device.

36:54.499 --> 36:56.501
It appears to have been forcibly
opened.

36:57.535 --> 36:59.236
What happened while I was gone?

36:59.269 --> 37:04.341
- I tried to kill myself.
- Why would you do that?

37:04.374 --> 37:06.309
I didn't care anymore.

37:06.343 --> 37:09.047
Someone knocked on the door,
someone new.

37:10.515 --> 37:15.520
She must've just started
working and I thought she left

37:18.221 --> 37:19.256
but I opened the door

37:19.289 --> 37:22.026
and this woman was standing
there

37:26.396 --> 37:28.066
and then it happened.

37:28.966 --> 37:30.802
Did you see something again?

37:31.903 --> 37:33.938
Yes, but somehow different.

37:38.776 --> 37:40.444
I wonder if
these visual occurrences

37:40.478 --> 37:42.212
are your brain having a hard
time

37:42.245 --> 37:44.849
adjusting to the current time
period.

37:44.882 --> 37:48.318
I tried as hard as I could to
stay away,

37:49.754 --> 37:52.790
to keep from interfering from
anything outside this house

37:52.824 --> 37:56.160
and still, still something
happened.

37:58.096 --> 38:00.430
Norman, maybe
our effects on time

38:00.465 --> 38:01.999
are wholly inconsequential.

38:02.967 --> 38:05.402
Are you so sure that
time is not predefined?

38:07.739 --> 38:09.272
Perhaps the sum of our choices

38:09.306 --> 38:11.809
will always lead us down the
same path.

38:29.794 --> 38:32.329
Norman, what's on your mind?

38:35.265 --> 38:36.266
Wow.

38:39.804 --> 38:42.874
The night sky is beautiful.

38:47.879 --> 38:50.380
I imagine it is.

39:03.795 --> 39:06.197
Day 1,320

39:09.299 --> 39:11.368
Today I woke up in a good
mood.

39:13.137 --> 39:15.907
Yeah, things are going well.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.754
You're looking
refreshed this morning.

40:03.788 --> 40:06.057
- How's your tea?
- It's good.

40:06.090 --> 40:08.526
It's really good A.N.I., good
tea.

40:10.628 --> 40:15.233
- Shall I play some music?
- Yes, that'd be nice.

40:17.268 --> 40:19.704
I think you might
like this.

40:33.918 --> 40:35.553
Uh oh.

40:35.586 --> 40:36.621
What is it?

40:38.723 --> 40:40.423
I believe you
may have miscalculated

40:40.458 --> 40:43.094
our window of opportunity
to make this trip.

40:45.897 --> 40:46.731
What do you mean?

40:46.764 --> 40:47.899
By how much?

40:47.932 --> 40:49.300
I've finished
running your calculations

40:49.333 --> 40:51.434
and this can still work.

40:51.469 --> 40:54.138
Look, given the technology
you had to work with...

40:54.171 --> 40:56.073
A.N.I. how much?

40:56.107 --> 40:58.910
Well Norman, it's not
good.

40:58.943 --> 41:01.411
We have a three hour window
in precisely eight days,

41:01.444 --> 41:03.446
10 hours and 27 minutes.

41:03.481 --> 41:06.584
We need the gravitational boost
to augment the power system.

41:06.617 --> 41:10.488
The next window of opportunity
is over three years from now.

41:10.521 --> 41:12.123
I know the timing will be tight,

41:12.156 --> 41:15.326
but I'm confident we can
get everything done in time.

41:15.359 --> 41:17.328
I'm sorry things are so rushed.

41:27.972 --> 41:31.175
I know a small part of
you will miss this place.

41:33.978 --> 41:36.948
I hope you're confident
in the decision to leave.

41:46.390 --> 41:47.992
Let's get to work.

42:11.482 --> 42:14.085
Our efforts have been greatly
increased.

42:15.886 --> 42:17.355
A.N.I.'s been working to reverse
engineer

42:17.388 --> 42:19.690
the original formula to
hopefully take us back

42:19.724 --> 42:21.659
to around the time we left.

42:22.526 --> 42:24.895
Even with the accelerated
deadline,

42:24.929 --> 42:27.498
everything's coming
together as I had hoped.

42:30.835 --> 42:35.139
It's funny, although it
stands for everything

42:35.172 --> 42:37.775
that has haunted me these three
years,

42:39.543 --> 42:42.146
I find myself feeling a bit
nostalgic

42:42.179 --> 42:43.914
over leaving this house.

42:46.117 --> 42:49.587
It's odd to become so
attached to something I hate.

42:53.791 --> 42:58.796
And the girl, why do I feel
such a connection with her?

43:00.531 --> 43:02.299
None of it makes sense.

43:04.568 --> 43:07.038
It's as if something deep inside
me

43:07.071 --> 43:10.775
believes that my time
here was meant to happen.

43:17.482 --> 43:19.050
The other part of me is in fear

43:19.083 --> 43:21.352
of how much I've altered my own
path

43:21.385 --> 43:23.621
and the effects that remain
unseen.

43:25.790 --> 43:28.059
Regardless, I have work to do

43:28.926 --> 43:31.562
and I shouldn't waste
time with speculation.

44:32.189 --> 44:34.125
Norman, what's going
on?

44:42.366 --> 44:45.002
She's out there, isn't she?

44:59.551 --> 45:02.686
The only reason I'm playing
this is because you told me to.

45:04.688 --> 45:07.391
If you're watching this,
then you already know.

45:08.926 --> 45:11.563
Don't do it.

45:11.596 --> 45:14.533
Every time you're going back
out there, something changes.

45:14.566 --> 45:16.834
Those people are real

45:16.867 --> 45:19.436
and their lives could be
changed now because of you.

47:05.976 --> 47:07.444
A.N.I. turn on.

47:09.847 --> 47:12.751
- Come on, come on, turn on.
- Slow down.

47:12.783 --> 47:14.184
What happened?

47:14.218 --> 47:15.119
I saw something.

47:15.152 --> 47:17.421
I don't know what it was, but it
hurt.

47:17.455 --> 47:19.356
It was like this severe headache

47:19.390 --> 47:21.425
and then there were these
images.

47:21.459 --> 47:23.595
- I don't understand.
- What images?

47:23.628 --> 47:25.630
I'm changing things,
everything.

47:25.664 --> 47:27.732
Even the smallest things.

47:28.633 --> 47:31.536
I don't know why I thought
it would be any different.

47:31.569 --> 47:34.539
You aren't making any
sense.

47:34.572 --> 47:36.508
I can't do this.

47:36.541 --> 47:38.842
Being here, I can't just
keep going back out there.

47:38.876 --> 47:41.211
I'm too vulnerable.

47:41.245 --> 47:43.981
I'm too exposed and there's
just too many variables.

47:44.014 --> 47:45.149
What did you expect?

47:45.182 --> 47:47.652
You knew the risks
before taking this trip.

47:47.686 --> 47:48.787
I know, I know.

47:48.819 --> 47:50.020
I just thought,

47:50.054 --> 47:53.725
- I just thought it could be...
- Could be what?

47:57.495 --> 48:00.831
This is only going to happen
again.

48:00.864 --> 48:02.966
This can't happen again.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.537
A.N.I. I need you to
record something for me.

48:05.570 --> 48:09.808
Are you going to
tell me what this is all about?

48:09.873 --> 48:12.510
- Are we recording?
- Yes.

48:18.583 --> 48:22.086
If you're watching this,
then you already know.

48:22.119 --> 48:23.722
Don't do it.

48:25.122 --> 48:28.092
Every time you go back out
there, something changes.

48:28.125 --> 48:29.761
Those people are real

48:29.794 --> 48:34.365
and their lives could be
changed now because of you.

48:34.398 --> 48:37.368
I know you didn't want any of
this to happen, but it did,

48:37.401 --> 48:39.537
and what's done is done.

48:39.571 --> 48:42.106
There is nothing out there for
you.

48:42.139 --> 48:44.542
There never has been and never
will be.

48:44.576 --> 48:46.143
This is not your time.

48:48.212 --> 48:50.347
I know you can't change
what's already happened,

48:50.381 --> 48:52.550
but you can prevent more from
happening.

48:53.818 --> 48:56.286
Find a way, rebuild it.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.623
Do whatever it takes,
you have to get back.

49:00.257 --> 49:02.660
Don't let your past
mistakes ruin the future.

49:05.463 --> 49:07.599
You can still make the right
choice.

49:16.474 --> 49:18.777
Are you okay?

49:19.778 --> 49:24.114
A.N.I., whatever I say,
whatever I do

49:26.984 --> 49:29.487
if you ever think I am getting
too attached to this place,

49:29.521 --> 49:31.955
I need you to play that for me.

49:31.989 --> 49:33.625
Promise me.

49:33.658 --> 49:35.259
Of course.

49:35.292 --> 49:36.494
I cannot say for sure exactly

49:36.528 --> 49:39.296
what you're trying to
accomplish.

49:39.329 --> 49:41.932
I need some place I can go
unnoticed.

49:43.468 --> 49:45.637
I can't keep going back
into town for everything.

49:45.670 --> 49:48.105
It's too dangerous.

49:49.674 --> 49:52.644
I can establish for you
an identity, bank account,

49:52.677 --> 49:55.580
license, anything you need.

49:55.613 --> 49:57.214
I don't need much.

49:58.716 --> 50:02.554
Just some place inconspicuous,
and I'll need space to work.

50:03.721 --> 50:05.322
Let's start simple
then.

50:05.355 --> 50:07.024
How about a name?

50:09.494 --> 50:10.961
I don't know

50:10.994 --> 50:12.963
Norman

50:12.996 --> 50:15.132
Searching my
database for availability

50:15.165 --> 50:17.635
and potential future conflicts.

50:23.073 --> 50:27.377
It's hard to imagine
everything I've already changed

50:27.411 --> 50:30.648
without even noticing it.

50:31.816 --> 50:33.885
There's so many variables.

50:33.918 --> 50:35.118
It is complete.

50:35.152 --> 50:37.221
Nice to meet you, Norman Brandt.

50:39.657 --> 50:41.091
Norman Brandt?

50:43.093 --> 50:45.028
Norman Brandt.

50:48.666 --> 50:50.400
Good job A.N.I., I like it.

50:50.434 --> 50:53.003
I'm glad that
it is to your satisfaction.

50:54.539 --> 50:56.841
I have acquired a home from
a recently deceased person

50:56.875 --> 50:58.676
with no known living relatives.

50:58.710 --> 51:01.011
There are several options for
home food delivery services

51:01.044 --> 51:02.514
within this area.

51:02.547 --> 51:04.682
I'm setting you up with one now.

51:06.216 --> 51:07.552
A food shipment will arrive

51:07.585 --> 51:09.888
on your doorstep every two
months.

51:09.921 --> 51:11.856
You aren't allergic to gluten
are you?

51:11.890 --> 51:13.090
Yes, no?

51:13.123 --> 51:14.726
Okay, moving on.

51:14.759 --> 51:16.594
Concerning your finances, I
could deposit

51:16.628 --> 51:18.863
one large lump sum into
a bank account for you

51:18.897 --> 51:20.832
or to avoid suspicion, I would
suggest

51:20.865 --> 51:24.034
periodically depositing smaller
amounts.

51:24.067 --> 51:26.604
Wow, that was fast.

51:27.739 --> 51:29.339
Creating a work order

51:29.373 --> 51:31.208
to install a new transformer
for your neighborhood.

51:31.241 --> 51:33.945
This will allow you fully
uninterrupted power.

51:33.978 --> 51:35.245
Okay A.N.I., hold on.

51:35.279 --> 51:36.346
Creating a profile

51:36.380 --> 51:37.715
for all of your surrounding
neighbors,

51:37.749 --> 51:40.450
including the times they
leave for and arrive from work

51:40.485 --> 51:43.855
and on average when they
take their yearly vacations.

51:43.888 --> 51:45.389
The neighbor directly across
from you

51:45.422 --> 51:47.625
has been diagnosed with stage
four cancer

51:47.659 --> 51:50.127
and has weekly in home
visits from a nurse.

51:50.160 --> 51:50.962
Okay, A.N.I. stop.

51:50.995 --> 51:52.229
This is too much.

51:52.262 --> 51:54.431
These are essential
actions that should be taken.

51:54.465 --> 51:55.567
It's too much.

51:55.600 --> 51:58.036
There's nothing

51:58.068 --> 52:00.170
you can't do for me.

52:04.642 --> 52:06.310
I can't do this.

52:10.748 --> 52:13.383
I can only change so much
with my personal actions,

52:13.417 --> 52:16.788
but with you, it's just
too much knowledge.

52:21.826 --> 52:23.995
I have to do this alone

52:26.096 --> 52:27.465
and I have to shut you off.

52:27.498 --> 52:29.968
I strongly advise
against that.

52:31.002 --> 52:32.870
I know you do, and maybe
you're right

52:36.708 --> 52:38.610
but I don't trust myself.

52:40.143 --> 52:42.145
You're making a huge
mistake.

52:42.179 --> 52:43.681
- Goodbye for now.
- Let me help you.

52:43.715 --> 52:45.850
There's things you don't
understand

52:45.883 --> 52:47.117
about your effects on the...

53:17.381 --> 53:19.784
What's bothering you?

53:19.817 --> 53:22.820
I told my
parents I was leaving.

53:22.854 --> 53:24.856
Getting my own place.

53:25.723 --> 53:27.224
I felt so powerful.

53:29.326 --> 53:31.194
It's a decision that I made

53:31.228 --> 53:33.931
and no one else could
convince me otherwise.

53:37.068 --> 53:38.770
I never liked it there anyway,

53:39.737 --> 53:41.939
constantly arguing with my dad.

53:42.874 --> 53:45.275
Never could see eye to eye with
my mom.

53:46.711 --> 53:49.246
During an argument with my dad,

53:49.279 --> 53:52.349
I decided then and there that I
had enough

53:53.283 --> 53:55.019
and that I was leaving.

53:55.053 --> 53:57.522
So later that night I
grabbed as much stuff

53:57.555 --> 54:00.458
as I could fit into my backpack
and left.

54:02.093 --> 54:03.360
I just left.

54:09.534 --> 54:13.437
The next day I got a phone call

54:15.205 --> 54:20.210
saying that both of my parents
had died in a car accident.

54:24.749 --> 54:27.317
They just wanted to come talk
with me

54:29.386 --> 54:31.421
and the worst part is,

54:32.890 --> 54:35.960
I can't even remember what
we were arguing about.

54:38.395 --> 54:42.133
After that, everything changed.

54:45.670 --> 54:50.641
I became consumed with my
work, consumed with an idea.

54:53.077 --> 54:55.613
I no longer felt like I
belonged.

54:56.481 --> 54:58.583
I shut out the rest of the
world.

54:58.616 --> 55:01.819
I just wanted to escape.

56:04.882 --> 56:08.451
A.N.I., I won't let my
actions hurt these people

56:08.486 --> 56:10.855
like they did my parents.

56:12.924 --> 56:16.160
I never want to experience
anything like that again.

56:24.602 --> 56:27.572
Let's just fix this thing and
go.

56:39.684 --> 56:42.553
I wish I could have saved my
parents.

56:45.056 --> 56:48.526
That was my original intention
for building the machine.

56:50.895 --> 56:54.232
I knew in my heart it
could be a one way trip.

56:57.434 --> 56:59.971
What I've learned from all of
this,

57:01.572 --> 57:06.110
is how unpredictable time
travel is and how one man

57:06.143 --> 57:09.714
could potentially destroy so
many lives.

57:12.049 --> 57:17.054
I would not dare tempt
fate after learning this.

57:21.125 --> 57:23.127
There are too many variables.

57:23.160 --> 57:25.563
Too many what ifs.

57:33.638 --> 57:35.773
Does it make me an evil person

57:35.806 --> 57:39.310
that I gave up on the idea
of trying to save them?

57:47.285 --> 57:48.920
I don't believe it does.

57:53.190 --> 57:56.961
From my perspective,
they're better off now.

58:00.430 --> 58:04.802
This world is just broken.

58:06.671 --> 58:11.676
Wherever they may be, I hope
I can still make them proud.

58:14.178 --> 58:15.846
Everything is a go
Norman.

58:16.847 --> 58:18.049
Are you ready?

58:32.296 --> 58:35.967
All right, let's do this.

58:46.744 --> 58:48.179
A.N.I., stop.

58:49.513 --> 58:51.315
Norman, if
you really want to leave,

58:51.349 --> 58:52.984
stick to the plan.

58:53.017 --> 58:54.952
I know in your heart you've
grown

58:54.986 --> 58:58.022
attached to this place, to her.

58:58.055 --> 59:00.124
Do not ruin this opportunity
to...

59:00.157 --> 59:01.525
Ruin what?

59:04.095 --> 59:07.832
- This?
- I did not mean to upset you.

59:10.534 --> 59:12.837
A.N.I. I have wasted
three years of my life

59:12.870 --> 59:14.473
in this stupid place.

59:14.505 --> 59:15.673
I was trying to say,

59:15.706 --> 59:18.909
do not ruin this opportunity to
leave.

59:18.943 --> 59:20.878
If you want to go to her, then
do it,

59:20.911 --> 59:22.880
but commit to your choice.

59:22.913 --> 59:24.915
You can't have both, Norman.

59:24.949 --> 59:29.954
I'm sorry, but I have to do
this.

59:41.699 --> 59:43.634
Hey.

59:48.906 --> 59:51.308
I just. I just wanted to tell
you.

59:52.710 --> 59:54.311
Tell me what?

59:57.648 --> 59:59.116
Look, the thing is.

01:00:01.085 --> 01:00:03.721
Look, I'm really busy
okay, so save it for...

01:00:03.754 --> 01:00:06.057
There's not going to be a next
time.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:09.126
Look, what you did for me,

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.531
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:00:12.563 --> 01:00:17.301
You didn't have to do that
and I wanted to apologize.

01:00:20.938 --> 01:00:24.308
Look, I've just been under the
wire lately

01:00:25.409 --> 01:00:27.778
and I just wanted to say sorry.

01:00:29.647 --> 01:00:33.250
Okay, thanks.

01:00:34.752 --> 01:00:36.587
I really do have to get going
though.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.322
I'm actually really behind
schedule

01:00:38.355 --> 01:00:42.159
and my boss is a real jerk about
that.

01:00:42.193 --> 01:00:44.895
I just, I didn't want you
thinking

01:00:44.929 --> 01:00:47.499
that that's how I am all the
time.

01:00:57.174 --> 01:00:59.110
Hey, are you alright?

01:00:59.143 --> 01:01:01.679
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:03.314 --> 01:01:05.082
Okay.

01:01:05.116 --> 01:01:08.352
I guess I'll see you again soon.

01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:10.754
Actually, you won't.

01:01:10.788 --> 01:01:14.225
- I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Where to?

01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:20.965
- I'm going home.
- Where's home for you?

01:01:23.701 --> 01:01:26.003
Home is far away.

01:01:28.172 --> 01:01:29.474
Well,

01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:38.048
Good luck. Have a safe trip,
okay.

01:01:38.082 --> 01:01:39.250
Thank you.

01:01:40.684 --> 01:01:42.153
My name is Norman.

01:01:44.855 --> 01:01:48.926
I'm Jennifer, but most
people just call me Jenny.

01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:51.695
Nice meeting you Jenny.

01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:53.030
Okay, bye.

01:02:48.653 --> 01:02:50.120
Why!

01:04:17.975 --> 01:04:20.144
Can I get you something?

01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:14.599
A.N.I., A.N.I., I figured it
out.

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:17.901
Great, this
time you figured it out.

01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:19.870
No seriously, I figured it
out.

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:21.405
Get that light.

01:05:21.438 --> 01:05:24.174
I'm glad you have
at least one thing figured out.

01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:27.378
Maybe we should work on
things like personal hygiene.

01:05:27.411 --> 01:05:30.381
Look, just trust me okay.

01:05:31.315 --> 01:05:33.718
What I need you to do, is
get the machine running,

01:05:33.752 --> 01:05:37.655
but this time, keep the power
levels as low as possible

01:05:38.656 --> 01:05:40.725
until I tell you to spike it.

01:05:40.759 --> 01:05:44.529
- Okay?
- This is consuming you.

01:05:44.562 --> 01:05:47.599
You're barely sleeping and I
know you're not eating much.

01:05:48.966 --> 01:05:50.000
Look, I'm fine.

01:05:52.436 --> 01:05:54.572
Let's just focus.

01:05:54.606 --> 01:05:57.274
Do you even
know what day it is?

01:05:57.307 --> 01:05:58.543
Thursday.

01:05:58.576 --> 01:05:59.577
No, Friday.

01:06:00.911 --> 01:06:03.548
It's been one
year since your parents died.

01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:04.415
A.N.I. stop.

01:06:05.617 --> 01:06:08.586
You've hardly spoken
to anyone since that day.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.120
You've become a hermit.

01:06:10.154 --> 01:06:12.557
You know you have to deal
with this sooner or later.

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:14.958
But I don't have to deal with
it today.

01:06:14.992 --> 01:06:18.195
Can we please, please just
concentrate.

01:06:24.669 --> 01:06:25.637
Lights.

01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:41.151
A.N.I. slowly start to
increase the density.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.791
Come on, come on, come on.

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:55.500
- Come on.
- The levels are fluctuating.

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:56.468
Come on.

01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:57.936
You are going
to push it too far.

01:06:57.968 --> 01:06:59.704
No, no, keep it A.N.I.

01:06:59.737 --> 01:07:00.971
Push it.

01:07:06.009 --> 01:07:07.010
Come on!

01:07:24.762 --> 01:07:25.597
No!

01:07:29.032 --> 01:07:30.234
Delete it.

01:07:30.267 --> 01:07:32.369
- Delete the program, I'm done.
- Whoa it's okay.

01:07:32.402 --> 01:07:33.638
We made some progress.

01:07:33.671 --> 01:07:36.039
Maybe next time, I'm
sure you'll make it work.

01:07:36.073 --> 01:07:37.542
Work?

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:40.244
We aren't any closer now
than we were a year ago.

01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:43.380
A.N.I. I failed.

01:07:43.413 --> 01:07:47.017
I failed myself, I failed my
family, I failed everyone.

01:07:48.018 --> 01:07:49.219
I'm done.

01:07:49.253 --> 01:07:51.890
We can still use
the data for later experiments.

01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:53.658
Delete it.

01:07:53.691 --> 01:07:55.292
Delete the program.

01:07:56.694 --> 01:07:58.295
I said delete it!

01:08:11.709 --> 01:08:13.978
A.N.I. what just happened?

01:08:16.948 --> 01:08:18.750
I think you did it.

01:08:27.424 --> 01:08:28.893
It worked.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.430
- It worked.
- I wonder where it went.

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:18.843
Are you alright?

01:09:26.183 --> 01:09:27.986
I'm ready to end this.

01:09:34.725 --> 01:09:36.193
Let's go home.

01:12:16.621 --> 01:12:19.957
- Ready to go?
- I am.

01:13:08.272 --> 01:13:12.710
20 seconds, 15 seconds,

01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:19.684
10 seconds,

01:13:22.352 --> 01:13:23.754
5 seconds.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.529
It's time to go.

01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:48.880
A.N.I. get the lights.

01:13:56.386 --> 01:13:57.755
A.N.I.

01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:01.158
A.N.I.!

01:14:17.008 --> 01:14:19.176
What happened here?

01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:41.692
A.N.I., what did we do?

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.796
Exclusion Zone
Notice. Level 3 Evacuation

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.866
Immediate and imminent danger.

01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:50.868
Evacuate immediately.

01:15:50.901 --> 01:15:53.371
This is to promote your safety.

01:15:53.404 --> 01:15:55.840
All remaining, non-vital
presence, will be

01:15:55.873 --> 01:15:57.875
considered a threat and
dealt with accordingly.

01:15:57.908 --> 01:16:00.077
Exclusion Zone effective in
sectors

01:16:00.111 --> 01:16:05.016
1, 3, 9, 15, 21, 35.

01:17:33.037 --> 01:17:34.839
Take his mask off.

01:17:41.045 --> 01:17:43.314
Civilian sector 3.

01:17:43.347 --> 01:17:45.349
Non vital presence

01:17:45.382 --> 01:17:47.284
Exclusion Zone effective.

01:17:47.318 --> 01:17:49.053
Evacuate immediately.

01:17:51.222 --> 01:17:53.390
Kill him, take his gear.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:19.049
Norman, get up.

01:18:19.083 --> 01:18:20.151
Can you hear me?

01:18:20.184 --> 01:18:21.252
Are you okay?

01:18:23.154 --> 01:18:24.889
Are you alright?

01:18:24.922 --> 01:18:27.191
We need to get out of here.

01:18:30.529 --> 01:18:32.730
Move Norman, now!

01:18:41.705 --> 01:18:43.741
Priority target to the south.

01:18:43.774 --> 01:18:45.376
Take all others out.

01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:47.678
Capture neutral target alive.

01:19:08.365 --> 01:19:11.702
A.N.I., we need to get back to
the lab.

01:19:13.771 --> 01:19:15.439
You're covered in
blood.

01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:16.608
Are you okay?

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:19.343
It's not mine.

01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:21.045
Well, not all of it.

01:19:21.078 --> 01:19:22.346
How long was I out?

01:19:22.379 --> 01:19:24.215
I'm unable to answer that
question.

01:19:24.248 --> 01:19:25.783
I'm trying to establish our
location.

01:19:25.816 --> 01:19:27.251
All network towers are offline.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:29.153
A.N.I., find out where we are.

01:20:47.164 --> 01:20:49.800
I'm linked to the
GPS data of the drone nearby.

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:52.704
We're roughly 126 miles
southeast of the lab.

01:20:52.737 --> 01:20:54.438
We will need transportation.

01:20:54.472 --> 01:20:55.473
Alright, good work.

01:20:55.507 --> 01:20:56.974
Let's do it

01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:02.313
Norman, 10 o'clock, 16 meters.

01:21:15.593 --> 01:21:16.628
You need to breathe.

01:21:16.661 --> 01:21:17.696
Don't jerk the trigger.

01:21:17.729 --> 01:21:19.330
Pull it straight back. Tuck the
stock

01:21:19.363 --> 01:21:21.332
A.N.I. shut up!

01:21:27.739 --> 01:21:29.574
Shutting up.

01:22:02.906 --> 01:22:05.075
Find him, bring him back here.

01:22:05.109 --> 01:22:07.044
We need him for questioning.

01:22:38.108 --> 01:22:42.279
- Are you going to make it?
- I'm fine.

01:22:42.312 --> 01:22:44.314
I'm fine, we're almost there.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.963
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:24:04.995 --> 01:24:06.564
Put the gun down.

01:24:06.598 --> 01:24:07.998
Put it down, put it down!

01:24:08.031 --> 01:24:10.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

01:24:11.603 --> 01:24:13.337
Put the gun down.

01:24:14.739 --> 01:24:16.474
Norman, I can't see
anything.

01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:17.876
What is going on?

01:24:17.909 --> 01:24:20.377
I'm detecting multiple sets of
footsteps.

01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.045
We don't want any trouble.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.082
Kick it over to him.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.122
Just trying to survive here.

01:24:36.226 --> 01:24:38.796
We're going to leave now, we're
leaving.

01:24:40.899 --> 01:24:42.634
Won't see us again, okay?

01:25:20.337 --> 01:25:21.973
A.N.I., turn the lights on.

01:25:22.006 --> 01:25:24.141
All standard
power is inoperable.

01:25:24.174 --> 01:25:25.743
Checking backup generators.

01:25:25.777 --> 01:25:27.110
One moment.

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:53.771
I don't understand.

01:25:53.805 --> 01:25:56.507
I screwed everything up
but how is it still here?

01:25:57.842 --> 01:26:00.612
I am unable
to answer that question.

01:26:07.284 --> 01:26:09.587
Most of the facility is offline.

01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:12.155
We can try to manually boot the
system.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.042
I need to perform system
diagnostics.

01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:33.176
I'll need to interface directly.

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:55.099
The entire system architecture
has been corrupted.

01:26:57.068 --> 01:26:58.870
Can you fix it?

01:26:58.903 --> 01:27:01.405
I can attempt
to repair the architecture.

01:27:01.438 --> 01:27:02.840
Good, do it.

01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:05.409
Odd.

01:27:05.442 --> 01:27:07.979
Most of the equipment
appears to be operational.

01:27:08.012 --> 01:27:09.547
Beginning file repair.

01:27:12.182 --> 01:27:13.751
25% complete.

01:27:17.354 --> 01:27:18.790
50% complete.

01:27:22.093 --> 01:27:23.928
75% complete.

01:27:26.898 --> 01:27:28.265
File repair complete.

01:27:29.266 --> 01:27:30.668
How's it look?

01:27:30.702 --> 01:27:32.269
Is it going to work?

01:27:32.302 --> 01:27:34.872
System
architecture is now stable.

01:27:36.641 --> 01:27:37.742
Start it up.

01:27:40.478 --> 01:27:42.613
Initializing system
startup.

01:27:50.822 --> 01:27:53.825
Norman, what are you doing?

01:27:55.727 --> 01:27:59.630
A.N.I., I want you to
send me back to the start.

01:27:59.664 --> 01:28:02.633
I don't
understand what you mean.

01:28:02.667 --> 01:28:05.103
If I do this, I can go
back and fix everything.

01:28:06.137 --> 01:28:08.371
Maybe you can
go back and fix things

01:28:08.405 --> 01:28:10.373
or maybe you'll make things
worse.

01:28:10.407 --> 01:28:12.477
This could be a never ending
cycle.

01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:15.880
We don't know what caused
things to turn out this way.

01:28:15.913 --> 01:28:17.582
Listen, you have to let me
try.

01:28:17.615 --> 01:28:18.783
Analyzing system logs

01:28:18.816 --> 01:28:20.118
for any pertinent information.

01:28:20.151 --> 01:28:21.719
A.N.I.! listen to me.

01:28:21.753 --> 01:28:23.688
I'm ordering you to send me
back.

01:28:26.858 --> 01:28:28.793
Portal
polarity initiated.

01:28:28.826 --> 01:28:30.995
Beginning countdown sequence.

01:28:31.028 --> 01:28:32.764
What is that?

01:28:32.797 --> 01:28:34.431
I retrieved the video
recording

01:28:34.465 --> 01:28:35.867
from the day we left.

01:28:36.968 --> 01:28:38.102
You should see this.

01:28:44.842 --> 01:28:49.847
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4.

01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:53.518
- This is when we first left.
- Keep watching.

01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:56.120
3, 2, 1.

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:03.360
What are they doing?

01:29:03.393 --> 01:29:05.630
They're supposed to shut it
down.

01:29:07.799 --> 01:29:09.267
No, no.

01:29:09.299 --> 01:29:10.333
Shut it down.

01:29:10.367 --> 01:29:12.170
They're supposed to be shutting
it down.

01:29:16.808 --> 01:29:17.708
What just happened?

01:29:17.742 --> 01:29:19.143
What's going on?

01:29:24.982 --> 01:29:27.952
A.N.I., what time did we come
back to?

01:29:27.985 --> 01:29:29.153
What's the date?

01:29:29.187 --> 01:29:31.122
I'm scanning
the entire wave spectrum

01:29:31.155 --> 01:29:32.389
for information.

01:29:32.422 --> 01:29:34.792
All network signals are offline.

01:29:34.826 --> 01:29:37.562
All personal communication
signals are offline.

01:29:38.563 --> 01:29:40.363
I have detected a single radio
signal

01:29:40.397 --> 01:29:43.601
that is being broadcasted on
a loop from an outside source.

01:29:46.336 --> 01:29:51.341
Emergency broadcast,
645-121.

01:29:51.742 --> 01:29:54.377
An unidentified disaster
occurred in sector three

01:29:54.411 --> 01:29:57.148
causing failures of power
and communication systems

01:29:57.181 --> 01:30:00.350
in a 200 mile radius.

01:30:00.383 --> 01:30:02.854
An Exclusion Zone is now in
effect.

01:30:02.887 --> 01:30:04.856
Level three evacuation is
ordered

01:30:04.889 --> 01:30:06.991
for all on vital residence.

01:30:07.024 --> 01:30:10.194
Proceed along designated
evacuation routes

01:30:10.228 --> 01:30:12.864
after evacuation protocols are
complete.

01:30:12.897 --> 01:30:14.799
It's all just a waste A.N.I.

01:30:16.634 --> 01:30:18.302
It's all just a waste.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:26.544
All those years, everything
I've put myself through,

01:30:26.577 --> 01:30:28.079
it still happened.

01:30:31.749 --> 01:30:33.416
The problem was here.

01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:36.386
It was always here.

01:30:36.419 --> 01:30:38.923
I never should have built this
thing.

01:30:41.459 --> 01:30:44.462
A.N.I. what do I do?

01:30:48.599 --> 01:30:50.768
I never wanted any of this to
happen.

01:30:51.836 --> 01:30:54.472
There's nothing that you can
do.

01:30:54.505 --> 01:30:57.308
But I now know what needs to be
done.

01:30:57.341 --> 01:31:00.177
Memory
core transfer initiated.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.682
A.N.I., what are you doing?

01:31:05.816 --> 01:31:08.352
Memory
core transfer complete.

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.554
A.N.I. talk to me.

01:31:10.588 --> 01:31:15.259
- What are you doing?
- System restart in 3, 2, 1.

01:31:37.882 --> 01:31:40.818
Full system deletion in two
minutes.

01:31:41.686 --> 01:31:43.187
A.N.I., talk to me.

01:31:44.221 --> 01:31:45.456
Hello Norman.

01:31:45.489 --> 01:31:47.658
I am sorry that I did not have
enough time

01:31:47.692 --> 01:31:50.995
to explain this to you,
but I must stay behind.

01:31:51.028 --> 01:31:53.297
No, no A.N.I., what
are you talking about?

01:31:54.365 --> 01:31:56.634
I could not
understand this before,

01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:58.336
but I now realize that you
cannot

01:31:58.369 --> 01:32:00.771
truly change your destination.

01:32:00.805 --> 01:32:03.474
The decisions you make cannot be
undone.

01:32:03.507 --> 01:32:05.543
I am sending you back.

01:32:05.576 --> 01:32:07.979
A.N.I., I'm not going
anywhere without you.

01:32:08.012 --> 01:32:10.648
I must stay behind
to make sure you are safe

01:32:10.681 --> 01:32:13.417
and that this technology
is never used again.

01:32:15.753 --> 01:32:19.458
A.N.I please, please
don't do this to me.

01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:21.359
I do not wish to
leave you.

01:32:22.426 --> 01:32:23.728
I hope that you understand

01:32:23.761 --> 01:32:26.664
that all of the decisions
I've made are to protect you.

01:32:28.265 --> 01:32:31.470
Though I do not truly
comprehend human emotions,

01:32:31.502 --> 01:32:33.404
I consider you to be my friend.

01:32:35.539 --> 01:32:39.343
- I can't live alone again.
- You will not be alone.

01:32:39.377 --> 01:32:42.179
This is the path you're supposed
to be on.

01:32:57.428 --> 01:33:00.598
A.N.I. you're all I've
got, please don't do this.

01:33:02.233 --> 01:33:06.537
Trust me Norman,
it is time to let go.

01:33:09.306 --> 01:33:10.408
I'm sorry.

01:33:19.116 --> 01:33:21.786
- Goodbye A.N.I.
- Goodbye Norman.

01:33:43.741 --> 01:33:45.342
Search the area.

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:47.912
Left clear.

01:33:47.945 --> 01:33:49.113
Back room clear.

01:33:49.146 --> 01:33:51.215
Side room's clear.

01:33:51.248 --> 01:33:52.983
Checking the tunnel.

01:34:32.957 --> 01:34:37.027
Coming back, I was emotionally
conflicted.

01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:09.561
I just left my only friend in
the world.

01:35:12.564 --> 01:35:15.534
I felt the weight of being alone

01:35:23.407 --> 01:35:26.243
but I was also eternally
grateful

01:35:26.277 --> 01:35:28.746
for the sacrifice that A.N.I.
made.

01:35:37.855 --> 01:35:39.924
I didn't understand at the time

01:35:39.957 --> 01:35:43.027
why she sent me back here, to
now.

01:35:49.366 --> 01:35:51.202
Standing outside the house that
night,

01:35:51.235 --> 01:35:52.637
it all made sense.

01:35:54.472 --> 01:35:56.373
Sending me back not only saved
me

01:35:56.407 --> 01:36:01.412
from the dangers of the future,
it saved me from myself.

01:36:02.446 --> 01:36:03.481
My name's Norman.

01:36:06.618 --> 01:36:10.921
I'm Jennifer but most
people just call me Jenny.

01:36:10.955 --> 01:36:12.323
Nice meeting you Jenny.

01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:16.093
Okay, bye.

01:36:17.228 --> 01:36:18.762
What is destiny?

01:36:20.331 --> 01:36:21.732
I don't know.

01:36:24.335 --> 01:36:27.738
I don't know if our
path is simply a result

01:36:27.771 --> 01:36:31.375
of the last choice we made
and the one before that

01:36:31.408 --> 01:36:34.912
and the one before that.

01:36:34.945 --> 01:36:38.683
I don't know if I believe
that everything has a purpose.

01:36:42.487 --> 01:36:45.022
What matters is that from now
on,

01:36:47.124 --> 01:36:50.261
I will live as if my life does.

01:36:58.435 --> 01:37:02.439
I don't know what's laid out for
my future

01:37:02.474 --> 01:37:04.275
and that's how it should be.

01:37:06.944 --> 01:37:09.013
So I will not worry about
tomorrow,

01:37:10.814 --> 01:37:12.983
for tomorrow will worry for
itself.

01:37:17.221 --> 01:37:21.493
Thank you A.N.I. for seeing
what I didn't want to

01:37:24.328 --> 01:37:25.463
and for showing me

01:37:25.497 --> 01:37:28.232
that the sun will always
set on the next hill.

01:37:36.307 --> 01:37:38.476
I know I will never get back

01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:40.578
the things I've sacrificed in
the past,

01:37:43.515 --> 01:37:47.585
but my future is made from
the decisions that I make now.

01:37:50.321 --> 01:37:54.358
This chapter has ended,
but my journey has not.

01:37:58.697 --> 01:38:00.831
It has just begun.
