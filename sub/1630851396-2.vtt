WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:10.052
People do come to this country
'cause they think it's freer.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.553
-It is freer.
-Right?

00:11.637 --> 00:14.223
And so my family, you know,
fine, we were leaving India,

00:14.306 --> 00:16.265
which is a democracy,
but still, when we came here,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.976
you were looking for a better life.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.647
No joke, last time I was in Iran,
I was in a café with my cousins

00:21.730 --> 00:27.444
and I was being the loud fuck I am here,
and everyone was looking at me,

00:27.528 --> 00:30.989
and my cousin's like, "Keep it down,
because those army guys walking over,

00:31.073 --> 00:32.991
that's for you being loud."

00:33.075 --> 00:36.745
Like they'll just--
You can't even talk loudly there without…

00:36.828 --> 00:37.871
Oh, fuck.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.831
Terrible house parties.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.793
Can I tell you something?
Great house parties.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.296
Just that's the only thing.
All in the basement.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.173
-Absolutely.
-It's all like this.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.424
Piety on the street…

00:49.508 --> 00:52.803
Party in the freaking basement.
And that's so true.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.888
Yeah, that was my Tinder bio too.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.763
Hello, everybody! Welcome.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.057
Good evening.
I am what remains of Jon Stewart.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.142
Welcome…

01:41.518 --> 01:43.020
to my humble home.

01:45.189 --> 01:49.943
They're excited to see live television.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.821
Tonight we're gonna talk about America.

01:52.905 --> 01:56.909
'Merica, land of boundless opportunity,

01:57.534 --> 01:59.244
where the rights are inalienable,

02:00.412 --> 02:01.747
buffets are all-you-can-eat.

02:01.830 --> 02:05.792
A land so great
people escape their own countries

02:05.876 --> 02:09.963
to come to a place
where people pay to escape a room.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.138
Why don't you just fucking leave?
Why don't you just leave the room?

02:20.516 --> 02:23.435
But one American treasure
towers above all others,

02:23.519 --> 02:27.898
our most precious resource of them all,

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
freedom.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.903
Freedom flows in American veins.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.029
-Freedom.
-Freedom.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.739
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

02:35.822 --> 02:37.658
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

02:37.741 --> 02:39.409
Freedom!

02:45.123 --> 02:47.584
That last gentlemen seems very likable.

02:52.130 --> 02:56.176
But, you know,
freedom isn't just our greatest gift.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.178
Freedom is delicious.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.014
Cars and freedom.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.476
Join your friends
for our Freedom Polka Cruise 2022.

03:08.939 --> 03:13.277
By the way, "Freedom Polka Cruise"
was actually Ted Cruz's birth name.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.618
He changed it.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.954
Freedom is America's best trait.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.125
It is smoked meat in a muscle car
on a cruise ship.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.794
So, is there a catch?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.546
Freedom is not free.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.632
Oh, right.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.718
It's not free.

03:37.801 --> 03:42.014
Preserving freedom often takes
courage and sacrifice.

03:42.097 --> 03:45.392
Or have you not spoken
to your grandparents lately?

03:45.475 --> 03:48.437
They are known today
as America's greatest generation.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.148
We had one purpose,
and that was to win the war.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.235
Whether it was the rationing
of meat or gasoline,

03:55.319 --> 03:58.155
or cigarettes or alcohol, or whatever.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.324
Women were asked
to give up their silk stockings

04:00.407 --> 04:03.160
so they could be recycled
for war purposes.

04:03.243 --> 04:08.373
Sure, it's a sacrifice.
Give away your best pots, you know.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.375
But it's war. You just did it.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.044
No pots…

04:13.295 --> 04:18.132
no pans. When I was your age,
I had to grill the cheese on the sidewalk…

04:20.260 --> 04:21.887
all to defeat Hitler.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.808
And now there's a new threat
to our freedom, COVID-19.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.437
It has stolen our freedom
to send our kids to school,

04:30.521 --> 04:32.773
to exhale in a Starbucks,

04:32.856 --> 04:36.151
to kiss the chef on the lips
after a delicious meal.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.403
Oh, Carmine…

04:42.157 --> 04:45.118
your eggplant rollatini moves me.

04:48.121 --> 04:53.585
And so once again, to protect freedom,
Americans must rise up together,

04:54.169 --> 04:58.590
making the individual sacrifices
like wearing a mask

04:58.674 --> 05:04.721
to preserve the greater good of this land
that God has granted…

05:04.805 --> 05:06.056
I won't be wearing my mask.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.144
I'm-- I'm s--
I'm sorry. Patriot says what?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.437
I won't wear a mask.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
Why?

05:16.400 --> 05:19.862
I need you to tell me, how do I play
a saxophone and sing with a mask on?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.113
I'll let you think about that.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.514
Yeah, I can see how that's--
It's not gonna--

05:47.598 --> 05:49.141
It's not gonna work. Oh, wait.

06:12.998 --> 06:17.503
Yeah, I'm one of the few saxophonists
who does it without the keys.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.965
It's all with the tongue and the airflow.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.759
I don't even need to…

06:23.842 --> 06:24.927
I just--

06:27.596 --> 06:30.307
So freedom isn't free.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.393
But apparently,
wearing a mask is too steep a price.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.522
They want to haggle a little bit.
Well, that's all right.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.024
We have a vaccine whose efficacy

06:39.107 --> 06:41.860
will also preserve the foundation
of this great nation.

06:42.402 --> 06:47.449
So as George Washington did
with smallpox, so shall we…

06:47.533 --> 06:49.201
I will not be taking the vaccine.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.911
I won't get myself vaccinated.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.163
Yeah, I don't--
I'm not gonna get the COVID vaccine.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.624
What the fuck?

06:57.417 --> 07:01.964
I thought we all agreed just a second ago
that freedom isn't free,

07:02.047 --> 07:06.468
and patriots sacrifice
to preserve that freedom.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.387
So, why not?

07:08.470 --> 07:09.471
I'm an American.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.057
I have the freedom to decide
if I'm gonna take a vaccine or not.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.517
Freedom to choose.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.269
'Cause I believe in freedom.

07:15.352 --> 07:20.107
And forcing people to wear ma--
Take vaccines is against freedom.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.779
I think you were evicted
from your apartment as well.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.156
I don't know if you saw the…

07:29.658 --> 07:33.829
All right. So you won't do it for freedom

07:33.912 --> 07:36.415
because your freedom…

07:39.126 --> 07:42.921
This country is great
because we have freedom.

07:43.005 --> 07:46.800
But I warn you, freedom isn't free.
It requires sacrifice,

07:46.884 --> 07:50.804
which I don't have to make
because of the freedom you sacrif--

07:50.888 --> 07:51.930
Fuck!

07:54.183 --> 07:58.729
These people's flag should be
a Gadsden snake sucking its own dick.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.318
Well…

08:07.154 --> 08:10.073
By the way, I do not know
if that is biologically accurate.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.995
That's the kind of thing
that really wets my reed.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.458
More saxophone humor.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.543
And thus the problem with freedom.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.672
Individual freedom requires
collective action.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.591
And a collective is a group.

08:27.674 --> 08:32.346
But if every sacrifice for the group
is viewed as oppression,

08:32.429 --> 08:37.100
then we lose the ability
to preserve your individual freedom.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.645
So I ask you again.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.232
Masks? Vaccines?

08:43.982 --> 08:44.983
Please?

08:45.067 --> 08:49.696
The Hitler of the Golden State,
Gavin Newsom, gives the orders.

08:49.780 --> 08:53.825
Wear a mask, stay inside, don't travel…

08:53.909 --> 08:58.705
Socialist Democrat gestapo
going door-to-door, house by house,

08:58.789 --> 09:02.292
trying to stick syringes in people's arms.

09:02.376 --> 09:06.296
You're forcing people to wear masks?
They were forced to wear a star.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.843
Using a Sharpie to brand students
with a number

09:10.926 --> 09:15.138
to distinguish the unvaccinated
from the vaccinated.

09:15.222 --> 09:20.018
A prom should never inspire images
in my mind of Auschwitz.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.400
Agreed.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.280
Auschwitz is a terrible prom theme.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.497
Ah, a Kristallnacht to remember.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.253
But I see the problem.

09:46.336 --> 09:52.718
You think the government taking
public safety measures to combat COVID

09:52.801 --> 09:54.761
is like Hitler.

09:54.845 --> 09:59.099
And we think COVID is like Hitler.

09:59.933 --> 10:06.523
And so, it looks like we got ourselves
a good old-fashioned Hitler-off!

10:07.608 --> 10:09.526
So once and for all, let's find out…

10:10.110 --> 10:14.573
what's more Hitler?

10:15.199 --> 10:17.326
I-- No, wait.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.746
I believe you were supposed
to chant that with me,

10:20.829 --> 10:22.456
so we're gonna try that again.

10:23.832 --> 10:28.629
What's more Hitler?

10:29.505 --> 10:32.716
Do you-- By the way,
do you think that's how Hitler started?

10:34.384 --> 10:38.222
They really like
chanting the name "Hitler."

10:39.973 --> 10:41.725
All right. Here's how--

10:42.267 --> 10:44.561
Shit's getting dark fast, isn't it?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.022
Here's how it's gonna go.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.484
You got your Hitler on the left there,

10:50.567 --> 10:55.322
and then you got your COVID
and your COVID prevention methods.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.951
Which one will resemble Hitler more?

10:59.952 --> 11:01.995
First up, let's deal with body count.

11:02.079 --> 11:05.582
COVID's killed nearly five million people.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.584
Masks?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.002
Nobody.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.213
Vaccines?

11:11.296 --> 11:12.923
I don't know. Three?

11:13.924 --> 11:17.636
Let's say a hundred. You know what?
I'll spot you a thousand.

11:18.262 --> 11:21.598
Clearly, on the issue of body count,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.769
COVID is the Hitler on this one.
Point for COVID!

11:26.937 --> 11:30.858
All right.
Let's go to territorial ambition.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.819
Hitler had tremendous
territorial ambition.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.490
COVID is fucking everywhere.

11:39.908 --> 11:43.662
Masks and vaccines
have barely made it to Florida.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.749
Point, COVID.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.591
COVID'S making it a runaway.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.302
All right, here's one.
This is a little bit more fanciful.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.137
Time machine.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.014
They always ask,
"If you had a time machine,

12:02.097 --> 12:04.850
would you go back in time,
and would you kill baby Hitler?"

12:04.933 --> 12:07.978
And everybody's like,
"I don't know if I could kill a baby."

12:08.061 --> 12:09.062
And I'm always like,

12:09.146 --> 12:12.274
"I think I'm probably strong enough
to do that. I think…"

12:12.357 --> 12:14.693
I'm not super strong,
but I could probably do that.

12:16.612 --> 12:17.946
So…

12:22.951 --> 12:24.286
I wouldn't…

12:25.621 --> 12:26.830
but I could.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.292
So…

12:31.543 --> 12:33.629
That wasn't-- That wasn't right.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.716
So if you could go back in time,
would you kill COVID?

12:38.300 --> 12:41.011
-Yes.
-Yes!

12:41.094 --> 12:43.680
Where would you go to kill it,
the wet market or the laboratory?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.099
Oops, I stepped in it again.
What have I done?

12:51.480 --> 12:54.691
And I'll tell you this. I would definitely
fucking kill COVID as a baby.

12:54.775 --> 12:59.571
Now, would you, however,
kill the immunosuppressed deli owner,

12:59.655 --> 13:03.200
who has made you put on a mask
for 30 seconds to get a bagel,

13:03.283 --> 13:04.868
when he was a baby?

13:04.952 --> 13:06.662
I don't think you would.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.497
Point, COVID, for the time machine.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.209
Finally, propaganda. Now, I'll admit…

13:13.168 --> 13:18.257
COVID does not have a Riefenstahl-esque
team burnishing its image.

13:19.049 --> 13:24.388
But COVID prevention doesn't really have
any chilling propaganda videos either.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.600
Imagine there's no heaven

13:34.147 --> 13:35.649
Point, COVID prevention.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.611
But I don't have to imagine,
I'm living it.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.239
Better propaganda videos?
All right, that goes there.

13:42.322 --> 13:47.703
But clearly,
on the important measure, deaths,

13:47.786 --> 13:49.955
COVID's more Hitler.

13:50.706 --> 13:54.168
And so we find ourselves
in an absurd place,

13:54.251 --> 13:59.631
where minor sacrifices to preserve freedom
now lead to violent backlash,

13:59.715 --> 14:01.633
'cause they think it's leading to Hitler.

14:02.259 --> 14:07.556
You got militias, in the name of freedom,
storming representative governments,

14:07.639 --> 14:10.809
because those individuals were asked
to wear a mask.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.645
And the absurdity doesn't stop
at masks and vaccines.

14:13.729 --> 14:20.027
We're in a world where proud patriots
beat a cop with an American flag

14:20.110 --> 14:24.489
to overturn a democratic election
in the name of freedom.

14:24.573 --> 14:31.163
Is our democracy robust enough
to withstand a freedom without definition,

14:31.997 --> 14:38.170
or a fear of a future Hitler that won't
allow us to take even minor steps

14:38.253 --> 14:40.422
to stop a current slaughter?

14:42.132 --> 14:46.178
I guess we'll find out
on next week's episode of…

14:47.221 --> 14:51.558
What's More Hitler?

14:51.642 --> 14:53.185
We'll be right back.

15:05.531 --> 15:06.573
Hello.

15:06.657 --> 15:11.328
I hear wearing a mask
has made you oppressed.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.875
You might be new to being oppressed.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.712
Well, I have some advice to help you out.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.673
Tip one.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.926
Have y'all lost your goddamn minds?

15:26.009 --> 15:28.387
Shut the fuck up.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.806
Shut the fuck up.

15:31.557 --> 15:36.520
Black people have been dealing
with oppression for 400 years.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.398
And y'all couldn't last ten months.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.817
They picked cotton.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.152
You just have to wear it.

15:44.236 --> 15:49.575
We're trying to sell you a mask,
not sell you.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.410
You stupid motherfuckers,

15:51.493 --> 15:53.912
you're not enslaved,

15:54.496 --> 15:56.206
you're uncomfortable.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.877
And I'm so sorry, assholes.

16:03.213 --> 16:06.300
You are not oppressed

16:07.759 --> 16:10.637
You better put that shit to rest, yeah?

16:13.765 --> 16:18.979
Freedom and democracy have been declining
around the world for 15 years in a row.

16:19.062 --> 16:23.775
75% of people on Earth live in countries
where freedom is declining.

16:23.859 --> 16:27.196
The United States has seen
a dramatic decline

16:27.279 --> 16:29.072
in political rights and civil liberties

16:29.156 --> 16:30.741
over the past ten years.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.493
That's something that's accelerated

16:33.577 --> 16:35.287
during the past four years.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.623
Specifically, we saw declines

16:37.706 --> 16:41.418
due to mass arrests and violence
against journalists at protests,

16:41.502 --> 16:44.213
the dismissal of inspectors general,

16:44.296 --> 16:47.925
as well as a general lack of transparency
around COVID-19 prevention

16:48.008 --> 16:50.761
and the treatment of immigrants
and asylum seekers.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.932
More countries are now trending
authoritarian than democratic,

16:55.015 --> 16:58.519
and by the largest margin
that we've ever recorded.

16:58.602 --> 17:02.648
Leaders like Orbán, Trump,
Duda, and even Putin,

17:02.731 --> 17:05.067
were democratically elected at first,

17:05.150 --> 17:08.362
and then don't wanna risk losing power
in the next election.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.324
So they use division and fear tactics
to convince their people into giving up

17:12.406 --> 17:15.577
more and more of their political rights
and civil liberties.

17:15.661 --> 17:20.749
I left the country almost 11 years ago
when Viktor Orbán came to power

17:20.832 --> 17:25.337
and decided to get rid of
the election committee,

17:25.420 --> 17:27.297
including myself.

17:27.381 --> 17:32.553
They dismantled many guarantees
of fundamental rights,

17:32.636 --> 17:34.304
independent judiciary,

17:34.388 --> 17:37.558
independent constitutional courts.

17:37.641 --> 17:43.272
So this is not just changing
a constitutional system.

17:43.355 --> 17:47.526
It's changing the entire society.

17:47.609 --> 17:52.114
There's a slow erosion
of the principles of democracy.

17:52.197 --> 17:56.368
The essence of democracy
is someone has to be willing to lose.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.829
And if you look around the world today,

17:58.912 --> 18:01.874
most democracies fall

18:01.957 --> 18:06.044
not because of violent coups,
but at the ballot box.

18:11.592 --> 18:12.843
Hey. Welcome back.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.847
So, so far, we're talking
about sacrifices, masks, Hitler,

18:16.930 --> 18:18.557
freedom, the breakdown of democracy.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.977
We have with us some folks
who have suffered the consequences

18:22.060 --> 18:24.146
of when it all erodes.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.524
Bassem Youssef was
a incredibly popular political comedian

18:27.608 --> 18:29.776
and TV host in Egypt
forced to flee the country

18:29.860 --> 18:32.070
after facing multiple threats
from the government.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.157
Francisco Marquez
is a Venezuelan lawyer and activist

18:35.240 --> 18:37.701
who spent time as a political prisoner
in Venezuela,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.620
and has now been exiled
to the United States.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.664
And Maria Ressa is a journalist
in the Philippines

18:42.748 --> 18:45.083
currently facing multiple charges

18:45.167 --> 18:47.961
that could put her in jail
for a very, very long time.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.214
She's found guilty of one charge already,

18:50.297 --> 18:51.507
and that verdict has been called

18:51.590 --> 18:54.885
"one of the largest setbacks to democracy
ever in the Philippines."

18:54.968 --> 18:56.637
She joins us from Manila

18:56.720 --> 19:00.349
because she is not allowed presently
to leave that country.

19:00.432 --> 19:04.019
Thank you, guys, so much for joining us.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.230
Maria, I want to get to you first

19:06.313 --> 19:09.233
because who knows
when they cut the feed off.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.736
Maria,
you are currently in the Philippines,

19:12.819 --> 19:15.489
and you are up against terrible charges.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.574
Tell us your situation right now.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.493
Well, first of all,
thank you for having me.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.786
And you are absolutely hilarious.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.789
First-- I guess in the last two years--

19:23.872 --> 19:25.666
in less than two years,

19:25.749 --> 19:29.378
the Philippine government has filed
ten arrest warrants against me.

19:29.461 --> 19:33.048
The company I cofounded in 2012, Rappler,

19:33.131 --> 19:36.051
has nine charges, so I have one more.

19:36.969 --> 19:41.348
I was convicted, as you said,
last year, for cyber-libel

19:41.431 --> 19:45.477
for a crime that didn't exist
when I allegedly committed it.

19:45.561 --> 19:48.272
But you look in the context
of the Philippines,

19:48.355 --> 19:54.319
in 2016, Rappler stood up against
a brutal drug war

19:54.403 --> 19:57.906
that human rights activists say
has killed tens of thousands of people

19:57.990 --> 19:59.700
now in the last five years.

19:59.783 --> 20:03.579
And we also exposed social media.

20:03.662 --> 20:07.499
And the Philippines,
for the sixth year in a row--

20:07.583 --> 20:11.837
We spend the most time online
and on social media globally.

20:11.920 --> 20:17.384
In 2016, we tried to stop the impunity
of Duterte and Mark Zuckerberg,

20:17.467 --> 20:19.261
and we have, so far, failed in both.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.054
But we keep going!

20:21.138 --> 20:25.309
Duterte is the one
who has brought the charges against you.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.353
And what do you fa-- If you are convicted,
what do you face?

20:28.437 --> 20:31.190
The rest of my life in jail, you know.

20:31.273 --> 20:34.193
And-- And again,
we come to an existential moment,

20:34.276 --> 20:37.529
just like you did
in your November elections.

20:37.613 --> 20:40.490
President Duterte has one six-year term.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.702
We have presidential elections
May next year.

20:43.785 --> 20:48.916
If no guard rails are put in place
on those American social media companies,

20:48.999 --> 20:51.835
then there's no way
we will have integrity of elections.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.629
And there's no way I can see

20:53.712 --> 20:57.382
as much attention being put on elections
outside the United States

20:57.466 --> 20:59.927
as you guys put on the US elections.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.678
And you barely squeak through.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.555
And look at January 6th, right?

21:03.639 --> 21:04.806
That wasn't a surprise.

21:04.890 --> 21:08.936
The new propaganda
is a behavior modification system.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.813
A lie told a million times becomes a fact.

21:11.897 --> 21:15.567
And I think we all, sort of,
view social media as perhaps an annoyance

21:15.651 --> 21:17.027
but still somewhat innocuous.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.780
But I think you're saying,
"Man, the real world consequences of it."

21:19.863 --> 21:23.283
Now, Francisco,
you're coming from Venezuela.

21:23.367 --> 21:26.286
Venezuela is, for the American right,

21:26.370 --> 21:29.331
you're the model of where we're going

21:29.414 --> 21:33.210
if we end up with, like,
a national health care.

21:33.293 --> 21:37.548
So, you're the--
You're the government that we point to

21:37.631 --> 21:40.884
to say, "Hey, man,
you don't wanna be Venezuela."

21:40.968 --> 21:42.177
It's not socialism.

21:42.261 --> 21:44.054
It's a dictatorship of Maduro.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.140
It's not about the form
of government they have,

21:47.224 --> 21:49.059
it's the way they're exercising it. Yes?

21:49.643 --> 21:52.104
I mean, they're self-professed socialists,

21:52.187 --> 21:53.730
but there's more to it than that.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.607
You know, there's Maduro who is--

21:55.691 --> 21:57.359
Just today, came out a report on the UN

21:57.442 --> 21:59.820
saying that he committed crimes
against humanity.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.989
He's one of the few dictators

22:02.072 --> 22:05.200
who is currently under investigation
in the International Criminal Court.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.536
And just to explain,
crimes against humanity only occurs

22:07.619 --> 22:10.497
when there's wide
and systematic persecution

22:10.581 --> 22:11.707
and human rights violations.

22:11.790 --> 22:15.169
So it's not just one person.
We're talking about thousands of people.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.713
My case,
I was in prison for four months,

22:17.796 --> 22:20.549
-but I'm only one out of thousands.
-And you were imprisoned for?

22:20.632 --> 22:23.093
I helped organize a petition drive--

22:23.177 --> 22:26.889
Just to get signatures, basically,
to do a recall election on Maduro.

22:26.972 --> 22:30.058
In the process of doing that,
I was put in prison.

22:30.142 --> 22:33.979
You know, there were weeks at a time
that I couldn't see sunlight,

22:34.062 --> 22:37.399
had limited access to food or--
or even visitation.

22:37.482 --> 22:41.236
You know, another person was
tortured in front of me for 30 minutes

22:41.320 --> 22:42.821
just to send me a message.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.616
And I still remember till this day,
the director of the prison,

22:45.699 --> 22:48.076
he said, "Make sure that when you get out,

22:48.160 --> 22:51.163
you say all the horrible things
that you lived through and that you saw

22:51.246 --> 22:53.874
because that will give me good creds
with the people up top."

22:53.957 --> 22:55.125
It's about intimidation.

22:55.209 --> 22:58.545
And Maria's case, in the same way,
they're making an example of somebody

22:58.629 --> 23:02.799
in the hopes that they can tamp down
the entire population.

23:02.883 --> 23:06.762
Although, to be fair, you did try
and get people to sign a petition.

23:07.804 --> 23:08.805
Big crime.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.807
-Big crime.
-How did you get out?

23:10.891 --> 23:14.645
I was lucky enough
that I was a dual citizen of the US…

23:14.728 --> 23:16.146
-Okay.
-…and the government got involved.

23:16.230 --> 23:19.566
There was also
a big international campaign to free--

23:19.650 --> 23:22.444
done by my family
and other political people.

23:22.528 --> 23:23.570
But I was fortunate.

23:23.654 --> 23:25.822
I'm fortunate enough here
to be able to tell this story

23:25.906 --> 23:28.617
so people understand what's going on
in Venezuela.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.452
Bassem,
your case is a little bit different.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.871
Bassem is a very old friend of mine.

23:32.955 --> 23:36.750
Bassem was the biggest thing in Egypt.

23:36.834 --> 23:38.043
Come on.

23:38.126 --> 23:40.879
Don't-- Bassem!

23:40.963 --> 23:42.840
-Yeah.
-It was the--

23:42.923 --> 23:45.968
Pyramids and Bassem. Pyramids and Bassem.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.681
And I was fortunate enough
to come to Cairo and do your show

23:50.764 --> 23:54.226
right before the overthrow of Morsi.

23:54.309 --> 23:55.519
And it really--

23:55.602 --> 23:57.938
Just a wonderful, safe environment.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.940
The…

24:00.023 --> 24:01.817
But tell a little bit about your story,

24:01.900 --> 24:06.321
because you were a hero
when Mubarak and Morsi were in charge.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.657
When the Muslim Brotherhood--

24:08.740 --> 24:10.868
And then I was kind of like
the national hero.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.328
I was the one
who stood against the Islamists

24:13.412 --> 24:15.706
and then the military came in,
and kind of like--

24:15.789 --> 24:19.960
I turned from a national hero into a--
the number-one enemy of state.

24:20.043 --> 24:24.756
And people who were pro-military,
which is very popular,

24:24.840 --> 24:26.842
they kind of didn't like my jokes.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.720
And it's kind of like-- It was a very
hard lesson for me to understand

24:29.803 --> 24:31.597
that when it comes to satire

24:31.680 --> 24:34.474
authoritarian figures
are pretty much thin-skinned.

24:34.558 --> 24:37.352
You know, I wanna borrow your--

24:37.436 --> 24:40.772
the title of your show,
which is The Problem with…

24:40.856 --> 24:44.443
The problem with freedom is that,
more often than not,

24:44.526 --> 24:45.944
people who call for freedom,

24:46.028 --> 24:48.197
they actually call for
a tailor-made version

24:48.280 --> 24:49.615
that actually works for them

24:49.698 --> 24:51.950
with a total disregard
of other people's freedom.

24:52.034 --> 24:54.411
They use freedom
as a cudgel to get what they want.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.537
-Yeah.
-Right.

24:55.621 --> 24:58.957
You know, whether it's just like
a right-wing here that's saying, like,

24:59.041 --> 25:00.751
"Oh, we-- we like freedom,

25:00.834 --> 25:04.129
but not women's freedom
to have her own choice over her body."

25:04.213 --> 25:05.714
-Right.
-Or back in Egypt.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.509
No, so in the Middle East in general,
in Muslim countries, it's like,

25:08.592 --> 25:10.594
"Oh, my God.
You're banning burkas and hijabs."

25:10.677 --> 25:12.429
But they have absolutely no regard

25:12.513 --> 25:15.307
for women who want to take off their hijab
in the Muslim countries, right?

25:15.390 --> 25:16.725
So this is kind of the hypocrisy.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.602
It's like,
"The freedom that works for me." You know?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.729
Right.
And it was interesting too, because…

25:20.812 --> 25:22.689
And I'm looking at, for Americans,

25:22.773 --> 25:25.067
if this were the Three Bears
and Goldilocks,

25:25.150 --> 25:26.777
you know, "That's too military."

25:26.860 --> 25:28.779
"That's too socialist."

25:28.862 --> 25:30.989
-Philippines is just right.
-Yeah.

25:31.073 --> 25:32.908
Duterte really is--

25:32.991 --> 25:37.412
He's a model, I think,
of an authoritarian figure in the West.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.540
He was democratically elected.

25:40.541 --> 25:43.710
He's probably still very popular
in the Philippines.

25:43.794 --> 25:44.837
And what he's done is,

25:44.920 --> 25:51.093
he's consolidated what you would think
are the democratic guard rails,

25:51.176 --> 25:53.011
and he's taken them over.

25:53.762 --> 25:59.309
And does that make removing him
democratically an impossibility?

25:59.393 --> 26:01.812
How can you actually have integrity
of elections

26:01.895 --> 26:06.942
if your information ecosystem pushes lies,
laced with anger and hate,

26:07.025 --> 26:09.736
faster and further than facts, one.

26:09.820 --> 26:13.240
When your truth tellers, your journalists,
your human rights activists

26:13.323 --> 26:18.745
are being jailed, killed, or,
well, like you, intimidated to silence.

26:18.829 --> 26:20.873
Although I guess I'm not silent yet.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.791
And then the third one is,

26:22.875 --> 26:26.378
you know, you have to lift
that environment of violence and fear

26:26.461 --> 26:29.006
both in the real world
and in the virtual world

26:29.089 --> 26:32.301
so that people will even
stick their necks out to actually vote.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.345
There are always consequences
to standing up.

26:35.971 --> 26:39.474
That's an incredible point
about information.

26:39.558 --> 26:41.685
And it, in some ways,
goes back to what you were saying.

26:41.768 --> 26:45.314
Freedom, right? We all look at it as,
"Well, I get to say what I want."

26:45.397 --> 26:47.524
But if you were on the other side saying,

26:47.608 --> 26:52.196
"This is misinformation,
and it's polluting our democracy,"

26:52.279 --> 26:56.700
how do you censor that
or how do you manage that

26:57.201 --> 27:00.412
or use any kind of editorial authority
on that

27:00.495 --> 27:04.208
without being seen
as somewhat autocratic in your own right?

27:04.291 --> 27:06.376
-Who makes the decision?
-Yeah.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.629
Yeah. It's like, "Who draws the lines?"

27:08.712 --> 27:11.298
And, "How far is the line?"
And, "Who decides about the line?"

27:11.381 --> 27:12.591
-Right.
-You had an election,

27:12.674 --> 27:14.635
and people kind of like didn't accept it,

27:14.718 --> 27:16.845
and went and wanted to take things
in their own hand.

27:16.929 --> 27:19.473
But what happened in January 6th--

27:19.556 --> 27:22.518
I mean, the worst thing
that happened on there is the comparisons.

27:22.601 --> 27:24.811
Like people, like the pundit
on the news, were saying,

27:24.895 --> 27:28.023
"Oh, my God. This looks like
a coup from the Middle East."

27:28.106 --> 27:29.733
And this kind of hurt my feeling,
because--

27:29.816 --> 27:30.901
No, seriously.

27:32.194 --> 27:34.655
You know--
Like, first of all, first of all,

27:34.738 --> 27:37.199
when we have a coup in the Middle East,
it works.

27:40.077 --> 27:41.662
You guys suck.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.623
-You guys--
-We're new. This is new.

27:44.706 --> 27:45.999
-You are--
-We're trying.

27:46.083 --> 27:50.379
Keep-- Keep to what you do best,
toppling democracy in the other countries.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.632
-But, like, when you come to your country…
-Son of a bitch.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.509
…you suck.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.595
And the thing is, every time it's like,
"Coup in the Middle East."

27:58.679 --> 27:59.930
"White Isis."

28:00.013 --> 28:01.223
"Texas Taliban."

28:01.306 --> 28:02.724
Get your own references.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.978
I mean, it's-- Why are we being dragged
into this every time?

28:06.061 --> 28:08.272
You know we're hyperbolic.
That's who we are.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.691
You think I have you guys on here

28:10.774 --> 28:12.734
because I wanna know
what your lives are like?

28:12.818 --> 28:15.237
I wanna know what's gonna happen to us.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.989
You're the canaries in the coal mine.

28:17.072 --> 28:19.658
I just wanna find out
what the fuck's gonna happen to us.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.743
We're gonna take a break.
We're gonna come back.

28:21.827 --> 28:25.205
We're gonna talk about
the democratic guard rails

28:25.289 --> 28:26.748
that keep a democracy

28:26.832 --> 28:29.585
from dissolving into dictatorship
and chaos.

28:29.668 --> 28:31.044
We'll be right back.

28:35.674 --> 28:36.675
Maria!

28:41.388 --> 28:43.182
There are people who are saying

28:43.265 --> 28:46.560
they've never been so worried about
American democracy than in this moment.

28:46.643 --> 28:53.483
The ultimate problem may be, like,
it's fucking messier than an autocrat.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.819
And it's kind of--

28:55.903 --> 28:59.072
Look, if there was someone
who agreed with me on everything,

28:59.156 --> 29:01.867
and, like, used executive action to do it.

29:01.950 --> 29:05.204
-Yeah.
-I'm sure I'd be like, "You go, boy."

29:08.290 --> 29:10.375
Everybody wants to ban shit
that they don't agree with.

29:10.459 --> 29:12.419
-Yep.
-And how do you square that?

29:13.670 --> 29:15.797
Good night.

29:18.634 --> 29:20.135
Welcome back.

29:20.219 --> 29:24.097
We're speaking with Bassem Youssef,
Francisco Marquez and Maria Ressa.

29:24.181 --> 29:26.517
Guys, I wanna-- Let's connect some dots.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.686
We start out-- We're just talking about
sort of something simple,

29:29.770 --> 29:34.441
which is a population being asked
to take some simple measures

29:34.525 --> 29:36.318
like wearing a mask or getting a vaccine

29:36.401 --> 29:39.446
to stem a virus
that's killing so many people

29:39.530 --> 29:44.117
so that we can all get back to
a more free life.

29:44.201 --> 29:49.039
But we really are on--
Which slippery slope are we on?

29:49.122 --> 29:53.418
And how close are we
to this kind of autocracy

29:53.502 --> 29:56.004
that you all speak about?

29:56.088 --> 29:59.466
And are Americans
hyperventilating needlessly?

30:00.092 --> 30:02.511
I understand that people are scared
and worried about

30:02.594 --> 30:04.888
where this is going to go,
is it gonna get worse?

30:04.972 --> 30:06.265
I mean, so far--

30:06.348 --> 30:09.268
I mean, America has proven
it's still a good democracy.

30:09.351 --> 30:11.270
It still works. You still have elections.

30:11.353 --> 30:14.273
You can have the power
to change people you don't like.

30:14.356 --> 30:15.566
But the problem is, I think--

30:15.649 --> 30:18.277
If there's ever--
I hope not because I live here now.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.903
If there's ever--

30:19.987 --> 30:21.530
Like, the death of democracy
and everything.

30:21.613 --> 30:24.908
The death of democracy in America could
only be summarized in one word: money.

30:25.576 --> 30:28.996
Look, it is about power and money
all across the board.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.247
Power and money.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.291
So think of-- The phases are this, right?

30:32.374 --> 30:36.545
Someone seeds a metanarrative
that is kind of half-true,

30:36.628 --> 30:41.008
it infects, it becomes a virus of lies
and infects real people,

30:41.091 --> 30:43.635
then those real people spread it.

30:43.719 --> 30:48.098
That is a diseased system,
and that is what we're living in.

30:48.182 --> 30:50.100
Our dystopia is your dystopia.

30:50.184 --> 30:52.352
Frankly, partly your creation.

30:52.436 --> 30:55.814
It's like we're fighting two pandemics.

30:55.898 --> 30:58.025
And two viral things.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.401
It's interesting, I originally said,

30:59.484 --> 31:02.112
"This is like
the fable of the Three Bears."

31:02.196 --> 31:03.238
It's really Scarface.

31:03.322 --> 31:06.450
It's about-- It's first you get the money,
then you get the power.

31:06.533 --> 31:11.371
And January 6,
the people who went to Capitol Hill,

31:11.455 --> 31:15.167
they're not gonna change
what they think overnight.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.376
They're not going--

31:16.460 --> 31:20.047
It's gonna take years
because it plays to their cognitive bias.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.757
We keep bringing up January 6

31:21.840 --> 31:26.261
as though that's the seminal moment,
and in my mind, it's really not.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.764
It was the TV show moment.

31:28.847 --> 31:33.810
But I think what's more dangerous
is what's happening afterwards.

31:34.561 --> 31:39.066
You know, Trump is targeting states
that have Republican legislatures.

31:39.149 --> 31:42.444
And in some ways,
he's like a white hat hacker.

31:42.528 --> 31:46.281
He exposed
where the democracies are vulnerable.

31:46.365 --> 31:49.785
"There's certain areas of elections
that are generally--

31:49.868 --> 31:53.789
They're held by partisans,
but they're generally administrative.

31:53.872 --> 31:57.251
And if I replace them with idealogues

31:58.043 --> 32:02.923
and the country is so closely divided
that it all comes down to these states,

32:03.006 --> 32:07.386
I've just removed any margin of error
from having to win an election."

32:07.469 --> 32:08.762
I don't think this country's--

32:08.846 --> 32:14.393
The danger isn't necessarily dictatorship,
it's permanent minority rule.

32:15.561 --> 32:17.312
This is the challenge that we have.

32:17.396 --> 32:21.149
And look, I mean, Duterte was Trump
before Trump was Trump.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.234
Right? And--

32:22.317 --> 32:24.570
When Trump was elected
in the United States,

32:24.653 --> 32:27.865
the diplomatic community here was going,
"Why are they so similar?"

32:27.948 --> 32:30.742
And part of the reason
they're so similar is

32:30.826 --> 32:34.288
because of the way they communicate,
the "us" against "them."

32:34.371 --> 32:36.832
The way they use the digital landscape.

32:36.915 --> 32:39.626
So this is what we're battling.

32:40.210 --> 32:44.006
Venezuela, though,
is still a bit different

32:44.089 --> 32:47.009
because Egypt and the Philippines
are still working on

32:47.092 --> 32:52.431
sort of a strange alt-world democracy
as its foundation.

32:52.514 --> 32:57.936
Venezuela looks much more like
when we mythologize a dictatorship.

32:58.020 --> 33:00.939
If Duterte and Sisi were up for election,

33:01.023 --> 33:03.233
I think they would
probably win the popular vote.

33:03.317 --> 33:04.484
I don't think Maduro would.

33:04.568 --> 33:07.237
No, Maduro is completely rejected
by the majority of the people.

33:07.321 --> 33:10.949
And I would like to signal-- We were
talking about slow erosion of democracy.

33:11.033 --> 33:13.577
You know,
Venezuela wasn't always a dictatorship.

33:13.660 --> 33:17.706
We were the beacon of democracy
for 40-50 years in South America.

33:17.789 --> 33:20.125
And look at Venezuela
because of that dictatorship,

33:20.209 --> 33:23.337
six million Venezuelans have fled
in the last five years.

33:23.420 --> 33:27.257
We are the largest refugee crisis
in the history of the western hemisphere.

33:27.341 --> 33:31.386
We're only after Syria worldwide,
and we don't have a decade-long war.

33:31.470 --> 33:32.930
All we have is a dictatorship

33:33.013 --> 33:36.308
that through his policy
has created hunger, inequality.

33:36.391 --> 33:40.896
This supposedly "socialist" dictatorship
who really just targets the people.

33:40.979 --> 33:44.608
So that's one of the things I think is
very dangerous about losing democracy,

33:44.691 --> 33:46.401
that there are real-life consequences

33:46.485 --> 33:50.822
and sometimes people sort of
lose that insight in the day-to-day.

33:50.906 --> 33:55.327
There's a large swath
that views the default setting on America,

33:55.410 --> 33:59.373
the factory setting as
white, male and Christian.

33:59.456 --> 34:00.582
They're not oppressed,

34:00.666 --> 34:05.921
but any erosion of their absolute power
feels like persecution.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.507
And you guys are experiencing
real persecution.

34:08.590 --> 34:09.882
And how do you tell somebody,

34:09.967 --> 34:14.263
a persecution or a victimhood
that they feel

34:14.346 --> 34:18.391
that's not based on anything foundational?

34:18.475 --> 34:20.351
That's the whole thing
about irrational fear

34:20.435 --> 34:22.521
and that's why people,
for example, in the Middle East

34:22.603 --> 34:26.650
would kind of choose the strong man
because they feel threatened.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.527
We don't like to be like
what's happening in Syria.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.112
We don't like to have this thing
that's happening in Iraq.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.656
So the alternative is so bloody.

34:32.739 --> 34:37.494
So here they will come to you about,
like, issues that are very vague.

34:37.578 --> 34:41.540
Identity, your religion, patriotism,
America, freedom.

34:41.623 --> 34:43.958
Things, like, big ideas that--

34:44.042 --> 34:46.253
It's just like, these are all abstracts.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.255
The thing is you rile those people,

34:48.338 --> 34:50.632
making them think all the time
that they are threatened,

34:50.716 --> 34:53.510
that their identity, whatever that means,
is gonna be taken away from them.

34:53.594 --> 34:57.264
Their freedom, whatever the definition
of that, is gonna be taken away from them.

34:57.347 --> 34:58.348
Right.

34:58.432 --> 35:00.642
When you put people
under that kind of constant fear,

35:00.726 --> 35:02.978
people will always choose security
over everything else.

35:03.061 --> 35:06.064
What's the cudgel that somebody like
Maduro would use in Venezuela?

35:06.148 --> 35:10.777
The typical, you know, oligarchs,
traitors. That's a type of, like, epithet.

35:10.861 --> 35:13.155
One thing about dictators,
they do two things.

35:13.238 --> 35:16.158
They always have these colorful epithets
about their opponents.

35:16.241 --> 35:18.619
You know,
you see it here in the US as well.

35:18.702 --> 35:19.745
Sleepy Joe.

35:19.828 --> 35:22.122
-However you wanna characterize it.
-Right.

35:22.206 --> 35:24.917
And another thing
that is just very worrisome is that

35:25.000 --> 35:28.587
they have this really great way of
telling people that, "I'm your avenger."

35:28.670 --> 35:32.466
Whether it's drain the swamp
or it's going against corrupt individuals.

35:32.549 --> 35:33.842
And that's how Chávez got in power.

35:33.926 --> 35:36.220
And Maduro,
right now his greatest thing is

35:36.303 --> 35:39.515
it's against the US,
anti-imperialist, or whatever,

35:39.598 --> 35:41.350
but it's all BS at the end of the day.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.435
Right. And do you think at some point,

35:43.519 --> 35:49.816
their ability to wield that is being
watched by all these other countries?

35:49.900 --> 35:56.823
Philippines is a test kitchen
for so many other wannabe autocrats.

35:56.907 --> 35:58.492
Would you say that's true, Maria?

35:58.575 --> 36:03.914
So it is death by a thousand cuts of
our identity, I think, more than anything.

36:03.997 --> 36:07.084
And if-- What this has shown globally,

36:07.167 --> 36:12.214
is that the technology
that has been allowed to manipulate us

36:12.297 --> 36:17.094
is actually showing how much more
we have in common as human beings,

36:17.177 --> 36:20.639
because the very same technology
in use in the United States

36:20.722 --> 36:24.059
is what is being used to manipulate us
in the Philippines.

36:24.142 --> 36:25.686
And it's very simple, huh?

36:25.769 --> 36:30.858
You know, like, just one algorithmic
choice of recommending friends of friends

36:30.941 --> 36:32.985
to grow your social media platform.

36:33.068 --> 36:37.573
In the Philippines, we watch Duterte,
if you're pro-Duterte in 2016,

36:37.656 --> 36:39.324
you would move further right.

36:39.408 --> 36:42.536
So you can substitute Trump here.

36:42.619 --> 36:45.706
If you're anti-Duterte,
you would move further left.

36:45.789 --> 36:50.544
That's 2016, 2017, 2018.
You know, and the chasm grows.

36:50.627 --> 36:52.546
That's on societal level,

36:52.629 --> 36:57.634
but individual level, your beliefs,
it's like Inception.

36:57.718 --> 37:00.137
Leonardo DiCaprio's Inception,
that movie, right?

37:00.220 --> 37:02.723
If you remember that?
They go into the dreamworld--

37:02.806 --> 37:05.100
I still don't understand it, Maria,

37:05.184 --> 37:07.561
so you're gonna have to go back
and explain Inception to me

37:07.644 --> 37:10.189
'cause I've seen it, like, five times
and as far as I'm concerned,

37:10.272 --> 37:12.816
it's just a movie
about buildings that fold.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.776
I don't know.

37:16.069 --> 37:19.114
-But you know how they--
-Here's the glimmer of hope.

37:19.198 --> 37:20.282
Go.

37:20.365 --> 37:25.746
If they're able to engineer something
to a negative effect,

37:25.829 --> 37:28.707
then it has to be able
to be reverse engineered.

37:28.790 --> 37:32.836
And that gets us, I think,
to the final part of this, which is,

37:32.920 --> 37:37.549
what are the guardrails
that you thought were the most vulnerable,

37:37.633 --> 37:42.429
and the ones that seemed
most necessary to reinforce?

37:42.513 --> 37:45.432
Here in America, it's a civil society.

37:45.516 --> 37:48.018
People who really believe
in liberal values.

37:48.101 --> 37:52.523
The problem with people here who vote,
usually Democratic or whatever,

37:52.606 --> 37:54.983
they are a little bit demotivated
to go and vote.

37:55.067 --> 37:56.235
They think it's in the bag.

37:56.318 --> 37:58.654
They have to be sold 100%
on their candidate.

37:58.737 --> 38:00.280
-We're complacent.
-Yeah, very.

38:00.364 --> 38:04.159
But the thing, on the other side,
they will go every single time.

38:04.243 --> 38:06.078
They don't care about who represents them.

38:06.161 --> 38:08.121
I think democracy dies with apathy.

38:08.205 --> 38:09.998
The active participation of citizens.

38:10.082 --> 38:11.875
In Venezuela, we were at our best

38:11.959 --> 38:15.295
when we had millions of people mobilized
on the streets, demanding their rights.

38:15.379 --> 38:18.340
And I think the biggest challenge
is to sustain that.

38:18.423 --> 38:20.926
You, Jon, you've had experiences with this
in different causes,

38:21.009 --> 38:22.094
I remember your march,

38:22.177 --> 38:24.596
I think it was against insanity
or something along those lines.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.681
Yeah, we won.

38:25.764 --> 38:27.474
Well, for me--

38:27.558 --> 38:29.977
-Everything's worked out pretty good.
-It's a great example.

38:30.060 --> 38:33.438
In that single moment, you mobilized
hundreds of thousands of people.

38:33.522 --> 38:34.565
-Right.
-At the end of the day…

38:34.648 --> 38:37.234
-Yeah, to get high in a field. I mean…
-Well, yeah.

38:37.317 --> 38:39.236
But-- Exactly. So how do you sustain that

38:39.319 --> 38:43.073
so people understand that
being present makes a difference,

38:43.156 --> 38:45.492
it actually creates an impact,
when the other things--

38:45.576 --> 38:48.453
It's energy at the local level.
That's what I learned in the 9/11 fight.

38:48.537 --> 38:50.497
It's energy at the local level.

38:50.581 --> 38:52.708
Maria, I'm gonna give you the last word.

38:52.791 --> 38:56.795
You know, in your mind,
how do you turn this thing around

38:56.879 --> 38:59.423
and what's the most important thing
to protect?

39:00.007 --> 39:02.593
To revive democracy, right?

39:02.676 --> 39:06.054
To fight this
death by a thousand cuts of democracy,

39:06.138 --> 39:07.973
to pull the terrorists' line.

39:08.056 --> 39:10.976
We have three pillars,
and this is active for us.

39:11.059 --> 39:14.229
Technology.
Put guardrails around the technology.

39:14.313 --> 39:18.525
Please, please, please,
you in the-- you have that power.

39:18.609 --> 39:21.111
The second is journalism.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.530
Support independent journalism, right?

39:23.614 --> 39:25.407
Fight for the facts.

39:25.490 --> 39:30.078
And third, community.
Community is incredibly important.

39:30.162 --> 39:35.167
The facts will help a community
become civic engagement.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.879
This-- These are
the lifeblood of democracy.

39:38.962 --> 39:41.173
So, that's what we're fighting for
in the Philippines.

39:41.256 --> 39:44.259
Those are Rappler's three pillars,
and we need them all.

39:44.343 --> 39:49.681
Community has helped us stay alive
in this five-year, forever-long battle,

39:49.765 --> 39:52.851
and I hope to see the dawn, you know?

39:52.935 --> 39:54.895
I'm optimistic.

39:54.978 --> 39:59.066
Maria, you know,
if there is anything that can be done

39:59.149 --> 40:02.778
for your cause and the personal cause
of not having to go to jail,

40:02.861 --> 40:07.032
please let us know
because it seems to me that sometimes

40:07.115 --> 40:12.329
when you shine a light on something,
even a dictator doesn't want the hassle.

40:12.412 --> 40:15.791
And as we saw in your case
and maybe yours,

40:15.874 --> 40:18.544
maybe you can't get everybody,
but if you chip away at it,

40:18.627 --> 40:20.212
you can save a few more people.

40:20.838 --> 40:21.839
Thank you--

40:21.922 --> 40:24.758
That's exactly how we stay alive.
Thank you.

40:24.842 --> 40:26.635
Thank you so much, Maria.

40:26.718 --> 40:29.304
Bassem, love you, baby.

40:29.388 --> 40:30.848
Francisco.

40:30.931 --> 40:33.350
We'll be right back after this. Thank you.

40:34.226 --> 40:35.853
Boy, that was great.

41:07.009 --> 41:08.635
Thank you so much for tuning in.

41:08.719 --> 41:13.557
Coming up next, the show where
no one can tell Jason Momoa's hot.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.059
They're blind, and he's hot,
but no one knows,

41:16.143 --> 41:18.395
except one guy,
and then they throw spears.

41:20.272 --> 41:22.357
I love it.

41:22.441 --> 41:26.153
To support tonight's guests
and their fight to preserve democracies,

41:26.236 --> 41:28.822
please check out these resources.

41:28.906 --> 41:32.576
And if you wanna continue
this conversation, check out our podcast.

41:32.659 --> 41:36.079
It's sort of like
if someone read you a blog.

41:36.163 --> 41:37.748
That's our kind of podcast.

41:37.831 --> 41:39.541
We'll see you next time. Thanks.

41:46.965 --> 41:49.426
Against my better judgment,
I've been following the rules

41:49.510 --> 41:52.012
the government says, "Put on a mask,"
I got called a sheep in the street.

41:52.095 --> 41:55.849
Do you take off to show
you are an independent, free American

41:55.933 --> 41:56.934
-or do you keep it on?
-No.

41:57.017 --> 41:59.811
This is in March of 2020.
I'm terrified of the virus.

41:59.895 --> 42:03.565
It's so interesting seeing people
who are having, like, these major fights

42:03.649 --> 42:06.318
on planes, like, on flights,

42:06.401 --> 42:08.904
but 30 minutes before, if you just rewind,

42:08.987 --> 42:12.533
how many freedoms you actually
had to give up just to get on a plane.

42:12.616 --> 42:16.161
You have to perform
a voluntary robbery on yourself

42:16.245 --> 42:18.372
-just to get on the plane.
-That! That!

42:18.455 --> 42:19.790
You have to rob yourself.

42:19.873 --> 42:23.877
They have a scan of your inner organs
and you're like, "Go for it."

42:23.961 --> 42:26.672
"I'm not wearing a mask
'cause of freedom

42:26.755 --> 42:28.340
and, yes, it is three ounces."
