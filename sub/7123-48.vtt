00:33.700 --> 00:38.422
Have you obtained the staff
of Stranson Doughblow?

00:38.497 --> 00:40.920
Yes, Bella Noche. We
procured the staff...

00:40.999 --> 00:43.377
using the full extent
of our wizardy ways.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.387
Then the time has come
to reveal my true form,

00:48.465 --> 00:50.308
and when I materialize
on this...

00:50.384 --> 00:53.058
Oh, this striz is
going down, man.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.265
You will receive your
end of the deal.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.817
The lost system of
Antediluvian magick...

00:58.892 --> 01:01.270
The tightest of all wiz biz.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.447
So right and tight I get
restless leg syndrome about it.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.116
Look!

01:06.191 --> 01:10.241
And now it will be yours.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.617
And mine!

01:11.697 --> 01:13.415
What the blood?! Ice King!

01:13.490 --> 01:15.993
Listen, dudes, all I want
is to be in the club

01:16.076 --> 01:17.703
and plus up my magic-

01:17.786 --> 01:21.006
What's the problem?
- Your life is my problem.

01:21.081 --> 01:26.508
Too late, fools!
Bella Noche emerges.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.806
Whoa!

01:28.880 --> 01:31.554
What the...

01:31.633 --> 01:33.852
Stop that now, trash cones.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.433
Bella Noche must not
cross into our world.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.767
Uh, why not again?

01:42.227 --> 01:44.446
Duck!

01:44.521 --> 01:47.240
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

01:47.316 --> 01:50.490
Aaaaah!

01:50.569 --> 01:53.743
Ah, cram! Here we go!

01:53.822 --> 01:57.952
Uh, hey. Hey, I can't
feel my magic!

01:58.035 --> 01:59.878
Me neither. What gives?

01:59.953 --> 02:03.753
Bella Noche is a being
of pure anti-magic!

02:03.832 --> 02:06.176
Y'alls got played!

02:06.251 --> 02:07.878
Uh, hello?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.258
Oh, what a fool am I!

02:10.339 --> 02:12.182
Aaaaaah!

02:12.257 --> 02:14.259
Go! Destroy!

02:14.343 --> 02:16.641
Throw your boots at it, or...
I don't know!

02:16.720 --> 02:18.722
Huh?

02:22.934 --> 02:25.778
Dang. Sorry, Ice King.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.901
This must be it, man.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.658
I've crossed into some
new super-insane zone

02:33.737 --> 02:38.493
where I feel like I'm
just normal again.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.919
Or maybe I'm just normal again.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.837
Hey, stop looking at yourself.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.961
You're ugly, bro. Get lost.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.384
This is <i>my</i> busking spot.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.796
Sorry, man. No time!

02:50.879 --> 02:52.472
Go, carpet!

03:00.389 --> 03:02.812
Whoa!

03:02.891 --> 03:04.518
It's got to be here.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.524
Even in my prolonged
state of insanity,

03:06.603 --> 03:08.605
my immutable essence
must have known to...

03:08.689 --> 03:11.693
Oh, yes. Hello.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.211
Ah, my research.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.130
MY Jackie... jacket!

03:26.206 --> 03:28.709
Mutation, mutation, mind expa...

03:28.792 --> 03:32.968
Aha! "Mystic Rituals and Their
Space-Time Applications"

03:33.046 --> 03:35.674
by Simon Petrikov
and Betty Grof.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.886
Betty.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.142
Whoops.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.848
Marceline?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.649
A-one, a-two,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.727
a-one, two, three, four.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.437
- Wait!
- What?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.081
Why are you holding your
<i>bass</i> up high like that?

03:50.105 --> 03:52.324
Unh-unh. I get better
finger action this way.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.493
But you look like a nerd.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.536
Move it back down. It's better.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.455
Move the <i>bass</i> down.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.580
A-move the bass a-down.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.252
Be reasonable.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.749
- Yes?
- Marcy, it's me, Simon.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.051
I'm back, but my body
might donk out soon.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.628
So, get to the Ice Kingdom fast

04:12.711 --> 04:14.884
and help me with this time
portal so I can find Betty

04:14.963 --> 04:17.136
and say I'm sorry
before I croakboat!

04:17.214 --> 04:18.887
I know that's a lot to process,

04:18.966 --> 04:20.514
but hurry, and bring Hambo.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.595
Hambo is the key.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.602
<i>Okay, Marcy? You got that?</i>

04:24.681 --> 04:26.103
<i>Marcy?</i>

04:30.771 --> 04:35.151
A long, long time ago,
Simon was my only friend.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.611
He was there when I needed help.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.117
All he ever wanted
was to find Betty,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.199
and now I can help him.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.673
Simon?

04:53.752 --> 04:54.753
Wenk!

04:57.672 --> 04:58.673
Wenk!

04:59.508 --> 05:00.760
Simon!

05:00.842 --> 05:04.767
Marceline!

05:04.846 --> 05:06.894
I thought I'd never
see you again.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.941
I can hardly believe it myself.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.485
You're all grown up.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.029
Believe! She's like a
million years old.

05:13.104 --> 05:16.153
One million years?
How could it be?!

05:16.233 --> 05:18.577
He's just kidding.
I'm only a thousand.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.780
And still looking good!

05:20.862 --> 05:22.840
Do you remember anything from
when you were the Ice King?

05:22.864 --> 05:26.084
Nothing specific... just
dreamlike impressions.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.554
Do you still have impressions from all
the times we flipped your bricks?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.751
I have... bruises.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.833
Excuse me.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.629
Man, Simon.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.054
I'm fine.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.756
You're dying!

05:39.840 --> 05:42.138
Well, yes, but only
in increments.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.345
I've still got work to do.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.973
Finn and Jake, will
you run my generator?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.683
Yeah, man.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.687
Cool.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.816
That's great! Keep pedaling!

05:57.899 --> 06:00.027
All we need now is
the catalyst...

06:00.110 --> 06:01.783
An object from the past

06:01.862 --> 06:05.617
that has been lovingly
tended to through the ages.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.043
Goodbye, Hambo.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.587
Because of you, I can
say goodbye to Betty

06:14.666 --> 06:18.637
and tell her I'm sorry
for driving her away.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.929
Thank you, Marceline.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.774
Where's my Betty?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.400
Where's my princess?!

06:36.479 --> 06:39.323
Princess! Princess!!

06:39.399 --> 06:41.902
Simon, don't leave me like this.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.413
Betty? Betty-

06:45.488 --> 06:47.365
Betty! - Simon?

06:47.449 --> 06:49.417
What is going on?

06:49.492 --> 06:51.915
I'm a thousand years
in the future, love.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.748
I opened this portal so
we could say goodbye.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.925
- You're dumping me?
- No!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.844
It's just that everything changed
after I put on that crown.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.048
I-I went crazy, you ran away,

07:02.130 --> 07:04.053
I-I never saw you again.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.850
But where would I
go without you?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.428
I'll never know.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.353
I don't understand. You
don't seem crazy now.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.181
I mean, in the future.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.063
The portal is closing.
There's no time to explain.

07:14.142 --> 07:18.113
Just know that I love you and
I forgive you for leaving me.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.611
Simon, I know who I'm
leaving you for!

07:20.690 --> 07:22.692
- Who?!
- You, dum-dum!

07:26.905 --> 07:29.203
Hmm? Simon?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.083
What's wrong? Are you sick?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.130
No, I'm old.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.049
The crown was keeping me alive,

07:38.124 --> 07:41.719
but it's magic was negated
by the creature Bella Noche.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.218
Don't die, Simon.
I just got here.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.925
- Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.
- I know!

07:47.008 --> 07:50.103
I'll fix the crown, and then
I'll figure out how to fix you!

07:50.178 --> 07:52.681
What? No. Guys, stop her.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.764
- Uh...
- Hmm.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.808
Yeah, but...

07:54.891 --> 07:56.768
It kind of sounds
like a good idea.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.604
Right, whoever you are.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.990
I'm sorry. It's the only way.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.113
No!

08:04.192 --> 08:07.196
Okay, rug, take me
to Bella Noche.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.747
Get on, Simon!

08:13.827 --> 08:15.249
I am getting on...

08:15.328 --> 08:17.001
the death bus.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.799
I got you in my sights, Simon.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.178
It's my time, Betty!

08:23.253 --> 08:25.255
I don't want to be
the Ice King again.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.340
It's like living with
eternal diaper butt.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.018
I can't do it! - Not forever.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.904
Destroying Bella Noche and
getting your power back

08:31.928 --> 08:33.851
will buy me time
to find a loophole

08:33.929 --> 08:36.149
that'll undo your
curse and your death.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.477
I can do it! You got
to believe me, Simon!

08:38.559 --> 08:41.029
- I...
- Get real, man.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.107
You're gonna be the Ice
King 'til the sun blows up.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.942
This is your one chance.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.494
I made a mix tape
for the ride...

08:47.569 --> 08:50.322
"Summer Jams 3"!

08:50.405 --> 08:54.000
If I don't let her
try, then what am I?

08:54.075 --> 08:56.169
What am us? - What?

08:56.244 --> 08:58.793
Uh, fair enough.
See you in a few.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.425
This brioche won't stop growing.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.723
Ron James, what took... you?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.220
Yo, my lab got creamed!

09:10.300 --> 09:12.143
I had to dummy-rig
an alchemical filter

09:12.218 --> 09:14.641
out of a dirty bidet
and a vaporizer!

09:14.721 --> 09:17.315
But will the double-negative
magic work?

09:17.390 --> 09:20.564
Heck yeah! Ron James
always delivers!

09:20.643 --> 09:22.316
Check it out, brotha!

09:22.395 --> 09:24.443
Yaah! In your face!

09:26.399 --> 09:28.197
Yeah!

09:30.987 --> 09:32.580
What the stink is that?!

09:32.655 --> 09:34.908
My lab conditions
were not ideal.

09:34.991 --> 09:38.165
- But you did not deliver.
- Peace, man! Aaaah!

09:39.871 --> 09:42.374
- We're here to help!
- Help? How?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.169
We're toast, bro.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.549
Simon!

09:48.963 --> 09:51.091
Hey, don't scare me like that.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.222
Just hold my hand to your face.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.975
This will be my...
last sensation.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.523
Don't be a wimp, Simon!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.100
Just give me a second!

10:00.183 --> 10:02.311
You got about 15 seconds.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.405
How the... Wait.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.866
Surprise!

10:15.949 --> 10:17.166
Tranch!

10:18.451 --> 10:22.126
Ohhhhh!

10:22.205 --> 10:25.379
You lose, Simon. Sorry, man.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.007
Uh, huh?

10:29.379 --> 10:31.473
This a party? Huh?

10:31.548 --> 10:34.893
Wizard City is saved!

10:34.968 --> 10:36.220
Whoa!

10:36.302 --> 10:40.273
Okay. Whoopee!

10:40.348 --> 10:43.192
So, then, Ron James told
me this girl I was with

10:43.268 --> 10:46.568
flew into Bella Noche and
mysteriously defeated it for me!

10:46.646 --> 10:49.399
Wow! Just my luck, right?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.110
Black out for a day and meet
the woman of your dreams.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.866
I will get you!

10:53.945 --> 10:55.822
Hey, don't be jealous,
Muscle Princess.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.748
She's gone... kablooie.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.576
Let's be realistic, right?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.582
We both know you're
not my top pick.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.288
Oh. grod!

11:03.371 --> 11:05.499
No! Aaah!

11:05.582 --> 11:08.335
