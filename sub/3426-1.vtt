17:43.594 --> 17:45.767
All right, whoa, chill.
Who are you'?

17:49.467 --> 17:51.606
Hey, pal, try to see it from my
wife's perspective, all right'?

17:51.669 --> 17:54.549
Our daughter disappears, and then she
shows up with a bunch of strangers.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.742
Fine, whatever.

17:56.808 --> 17:58.879
<i>(Emily) Look, we stopped
at Chapman's Cafe</i>

17:58.910 --> 18:01.789
and, I mean, we found
her in the parking lot.

18:03.014 --> 18:04.391
The parking...

18:04.449 --> 18:06.395
Actually, she kind of found us.

18:06.451 --> 18:08.397
<i>(Wayne) What are you
guys doing nut here?</i>

18:08.453 --> 18:11.627
We're on our way to South by Southwest.
And we should go.

18:11.656 --> 18:12.930
Sorry.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.765
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:14.826 --> 18:17.568
Um, wait, wait.
Um...

18:17.628 --> 18:20.575
Look, I'm sorry I...

18:20.631 --> 18:22.110
It's just, it's our daughter.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.643
She means the world to us.
We understand.

18:24.669 --> 18:27.673
(Wayne) She's not going to be staying
with her grandfather anymore.

18:31.476 --> 18:32.784
Thank you
for bringing her back.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.118
Of course.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.381
We're just happy she's okay.

18:36.447 --> 18:37.551
<i>(Val) I'm Val.</i>

18:37.615 --> 18:41.586
By the way, this is, um,
this is my husband, Wayne.

18:44.822 --> 18:46.665
<i>(Val) So, sweet pea,</i>

18:46.724 --> 18:49.102
what do you say we go in the house
and get ready for bed, okay'?

18:49.160 --> 18:51.436
Okay.
Bye, Lucy.

18:51.496 --> 18:54.067
BYE-bye.
Bye.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.976
So, how was the food at Chapman's?
It was closed.

18:58.169 --> 18:59.842
Oh, yeah'?

18:59.904 --> 19:00.939
You guys hungry?

19:00.972 --> 19:02.542
I'm about to get my steak on.

19:02.573 --> 19:04.678
Mm, I love steak.

19:04.742 --> 19:06.722
<i>Inch thick,
grass-fed porterhouse.</i>

19:06.778 --> 19:09.486
Uh, yeah, I mean, I think we
really should be hitting the road.

19:09.547 --> 19:11.026
Don't listen to him.

19:11.082 --> 19:13.688
He only thinks about himself.
South by Southwest.

19:13.718 --> 19:15.595
Me and Val's been
there three times.

19:15.653 --> 19:18.759
It's great music. You
ever been there before?

19:18.823 --> 19:20.166
Uh, yeah, I've been once.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.496
Are you 420 friendly?

19:22.560 --> 19:25.700
Psst, you kidding?
That's like his area code.

19:25.763 --> 19:28.573
[laughing]

19:28.633 --> 19:32.171
Look, I apologize for
my wife, but, you know,

19:32.437 --> 19:33.643
we all have moms, right'?

19:33.704 --> 19:36.446
(All) Yeah.

19:36.474 --> 19:37.514
<i>(Wayne) Anyone want a beer?</i>

19:37.542 --> 19:39.044
<i>Yes. (Emily) A
beer sounds great.</i>

19:39.110 --> 19:43.183
Besides, a little bit of buddyness
never hurt anyone either.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.725
All right. So, you've
really been three times'?

19:46.751 --> 19:48.731
<i>(Emily) So, how did you
guys end up out here?</i>

19:48.753 --> 19:52.997
<i>(Wayne) Well, we, uh, we owned
a day-care center in the city.</i>

19:53.057 --> 19:55.537
<i>We were doing pretty good, we
were making some good money,</i>

19:55.593 --> 20:00.042
<i>and providing a great service
for the community. And...</i>

20:00.932 --> 20:04.675
<i>One night, someone decided to
set the whole place up on fire.</i>

20:06.170 --> 20:11.552
Yeah, our whole life burned to
the ground, just like that.

20:13.044 --> 20:14.148
The world's a crazy place.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.214
It sure is.

20:16.481 --> 20:20.520
We wanted to start over,
and her father lives out here.

20:20.585 --> 20:21.689
Yeah.

20:21.752 --> 20:23.663
You know, and we
didn't want Lucy exposed

20:23.721 --> 20:26.224
to all the funky stuff
going down in the city.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.493
That's a song.
What'?

20:28.559 --> 20:33.030
That last part you just said about the
funky stuff in the city, that's a song.

20:33.097 --> 20:37.637
[laughs] It must have
been in my subconscious.

20:37.702 --> 20:40.911
Anyway, that's how
we wound up here.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.851
Well, I like it.

20:43.908 --> 20:47.185
I like you two.
You know?

20:47.245 --> 20:51.557
I like how you're out here,
living off the land.

20:51.616 --> 20:54.654
Hey, I think he's kind
of cute for an older guy.

20:54.719 --> 20:55.789
<i>(Sean) I mean, you get it.</i>

20:55.820 --> 20:59.233
You don't have to deal
with any of those, uh,

20:59.290 --> 21:00.928
dickheads in the city.

21:00.958 --> 21:04.235
<i>Some different idiot
around every comer, right?</i>

21:04.295 --> 21:06.275
Yeah.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.814
<i>[growling]</i>

21:30.021 --> 21:31.125
Stop.

21:31.188 --> 21:33.828
Emily, I love your bag.

21:33.858 --> 21:35.599
Oh, gosh, thank you.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.003
Where did you get it'?

21:37.061 --> 21:40.042
Um,

21:40.097 --> 21:42.043
it was a gift.

21:43.968 --> 21:47.711
Well, it's very stylish.

21:47.738 --> 21:49.615
<i>(Emily) Thank you.</i>

21:52.109 --> 21:54.282
<i>[growling]</i>

22:09.827 --> 22:12.137
So, I saw all the toys
out in the front.

22:12.196 --> 22:14.005
Are guys still running
a day care'?

22:16.667 --> 22:18.806
Yeah, sometimes.

22:18.869 --> 22:21.748
I mean, you know, Wayne takes
the odd job here and there,

22:21.806 --> 22:25.879
and we just do whatever we
need to to get by, you know.

22:27.912 --> 22:30.756
<i>[eerie growling]</i>

22:36.921 --> 22:39.162
<i>( Tyler) Man, these

22:39.190 --> 22:40.350
<i>How can you get used to this?</i>

22:40.358 --> 22:41.769
<i>[Lucy's voice]
Don't be mad at me.</i>

22:41.826 --> 22:43.669
<i>You can? Run away
without legs.</i>

22:43.728 --> 22:45.765
<i>Besides, I would find you.</i>

22:45.830 --> 22:47.901
[laughs]

22:47.965 --> 22:50.912
Ah, well.
I guess she's awake.

22:50.935 --> 22:52.039
[chuckling]

22:53.070 --> 22:55.914
I'll be right back. Can I get
anyone anything while I'm up'?

22:55.940 --> 22:57.647
How about another six pack'?

22:57.675 --> 22:59.177
Can't get it yourself?

22:59.210 --> 23:02.783
Didn't you just ask if you
could get anything for us'?

23:02.847 --> 23:05.657
Yes, no, of course.
Of course, babe.

23:05.716 --> 23:07.923
Can I get anyone else
anything while I'm up'?

23:07.985 --> 23:11.057
Actually, I could use
another Bud.

23:11.088 --> 23:14.228
<i>Do you need any help
in the kitchen?</i>

23:14.291 --> 23:16.237
No, I got it.

<i>Please. You're our guests.
I'll be right back.</i>

23:19.296 --> 23:21.173
<i>(Tyler) Come on, dude, sit.</i>

23:25.069 --> 23:27.276
Careful, brother.
Wasted much'?

23:27.338 --> 23:30.842
Whoa.
[chuckling]

23:30.908 --> 23:32.683
Here, you obviously
need more of this.

23:35.346 --> 23:38.122
Now what are you still
doing awake, huh'?

23:38.182 --> 23:40.253
My dolls were fighting.

23:40.317 --> 23:42.422
Oh.

23:42.687 --> 23:45.861
Well, Mommy is here now,

23:45.923 --> 23:48.233
so everything's
going to be just fine.

<i>[Lucy's voice]</i> I <i>wish she would.
She's so nice.</i>

23:57.935 --> 24:00.108

Well, it is way past
your bedtime,

24:05.342 --> 24:08.983

to go to sleep, little one.

24:30.201 --> 24:32.909
<i>[eerie growling]</i>

24:32.970 --> 24:34.916
What was that'?
Speaking of which,

24:34.972 --> 24:37.043
no, they do these crazy things
where on this TV show

24:37.108 --> 24:40.021
they go to these haunted places and
they prove that spirits exist.

24:40.077 --> 24:41.886
That haunted show is a joke.

24:41.946 --> 24:44.290
You're such a turd.

24:44.348 --> 24:47.352
Not that show again.
(Ty/er) The TV show.

24:47.418 --> 24:49.056
You watch that, do you'?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.428
<i>(Emily) Yeah, he does. You do.</i>

24:50.488 --> 24:52.832
He does. I've... No I've only
seen it a few times, so.

24:52.890 --> 24:55.769
That's a lie. He watches
it all the time.

24:55.793 --> 24:57.329
<i>( Tyler) Nu, you watch
it all the time.</i>

24:57.394 --> 24:58.930
<i>(Emily) I mean,
there's just no limit</i>

24:58.996 --> 25:01.442
to what these reality shows
are going to exploit.

25:01.499 --> 25:03.979
I mean, people shouldn't
mess with the occult.

25:04.034 --> 25:05.479
No, no.
She's right.

25:05.536 --> 25:07.345
'Cause it's real.
I've seen it.

25:07.404 --> 25:11.045
The whole
dark spirit world is no joke.

25:11.075 --> 25:13.180
Oooh! It shouldn't
be messed with.

25:13.244 --> 25:15.087
<i>(Tyler) This is exactly
what I've been saying.</i>

25:15.146 --> 25:17.092

Hey.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.061
She was in rehab, ass-wipe.

You know that.

25:25.956 --> 25:27.833
I'm sorry.

25:27.892 --> 25:30.805
There's a big difference, babe.
Don't listen to them. Okay.

25:30.861 --> 25:32.499
And that's why people
shouldn't do drugs.

25:32.563 --> 25:34.543
It weakens their defenses.

25:34.799 --> 25:38.076
It's true. That's why I
stopped doing the hard stuff.

25:38.135 --> 25:40.206
<i>(Sean) Yeah, and hey, besides,</i>

25:40.271 --> 25:43.115
everybody knows that all of
that stuff from those shows

25:43.174 --> 25:45.381
is like totally made up anyway.

25:45.442 --> 25:49.219
Which is why they're stupid,
kinda like Tyler.

25:49.246 --> 25:51.351

25:51.415 --> 25:53.224
You're...
You're a dumb-ass, Sean.

Okay, I've only...

25:54.451 --> 25:57.227
I haven't seen the show
every week, all right'?

25:57.288 --> 25:59.359
I've only seen it
maybe three times.

25:59.390 --> 26:02.371
The world is going
to hell in a hand basket,

about that now, okay'?

26:41.131 --> 26:43.270
Why not'?

26:43.300 --> 26:45.576
'Cause it's not appropriate.
