Okay, so, this gig,
it wasn't real.

theatrical and make-believe?

That's what I'm saying.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.637

10:05.639 --> 10:06.972
Weren't even
my kiss brethren.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.974
They were some other
"creatures of the night."

So they did this?
Yeah.

12:01.888 --> 12:05.256
I came in this morning, I find
that they'd destroyed my place.

you could be in.

play every instrument.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.276
They weren't our dates.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.345
B-but yeah, he-he took our ride.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.347
I didn't care.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.148
I mean, there's plenty of fish
in the sea, right?

16:25.417 --> 16:27.118
You ever been
to the brimstone club?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.354
So you stayed at the bar?

16:29.356 --> 16:30.421
Yeah.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.590
And arnold?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.292
I've known lex since college,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.361
But we're not really
good friends.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.229
I mean, do you think

16:38.231 --> 16:40.631
He could've done this?

16:42.601 --> 16:44.435
Do you recognize this knife?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.471
Yeah, that's lex's knife.

16:46.473 --> 16:49.107
Your buddy lex didn't return
to the hotel last night.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.275
Do you know
where we can find him?

16:51.277 --> 16:52.577
I've been calling lex all day.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.745
Nothing.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.483
This whole thing
doesn't make any sense.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.318
Why do you say that?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.220
(sighs)
okay, so, like, last night,

17:02.222 --> 17:03.488
Lex was on top of the word,
you know.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.622
It wasn't just chicks.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.157
I mean,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.425
The first night we got here,

17:07.427 --> 17:09.193
He came in,
he went in the studio,

17:09.195 --> 17:10.461
He recorded one of his songs.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.296
And I guess some producer
heard it,

17:12.298 --> 17:14.332
And now a label's interested
in signing him.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.700
Really?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.102
A record contract?

17:21.507 --> 17:24.409
So this guy lex young--
he's our prime suspect?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.377
According to
his bandmates.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.378
And he's also

17:27.380 --> 17:29.447
Been arrested twice for assault.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.182
But it looks like

17:31.184 --> 17:33.384
He really did have interest
from a record label.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.219
A $1,000 deposit

17:35.221 --> 17:37.121
From cogitator music
international?

17:37.123 --> 17:38.222
I put a trap

17:38.224 --> 17:39.524
On lex young's
credit cards.

17:39.526 --> 17:43.061
No charges since he dropped
a grand on champagne

17:43.063 --> 17:45.363
At the brimstone club.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.065
So if our rock star's
on the run,

17:47.067 --> 17:48.299
He's not leaving any tracks.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.701
What about this missing person,
tangerine?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.503
Well, no word
on her yet, either.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.572
And her killer did
a good job cleaning up,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.374
'cause henry wasn't able

17:56.376 --> 17:59.110
To develop any dna profiles
from the crime scene.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.112
Now, nick and sara
are pretty sure

18:01.114 --> 18:02.380
That that blood event

18:02.382 --> 18:04.649
Is consistent
with marcy cody's injuries.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.850
Okay.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.185
What about this one?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.419
Your guess is
as good as mine.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.222
I've seen a lot
of weird blood patterns,

18:11.224 --> 18:13.224
But I have no idea
what's going on there.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.359
Okay.
(sharp banging)

18:15.361 --> 18:17.462
What is that, ballistics?

18:17.464 --> 18:22.300
Actually, that sounds like
it was coming from the garage.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.569
(sharp banging continues
rhythmically)

18:31.543 --> 18:33.277
Russell: Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:33.279 --> 18:34.712
Dude!

18:34.714 --> 18:36.514
(chuckles):
What are you doing, man?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.116
(laughs):
Hi.

18:38.118 --> 18:42.253
We can blame it on my insomnia
and late-night tv marathons.

18:42.255 --> 18:45.590
Have you ever seen
the documentary on the who

18:45.592 --> 18:47.859
Where keith moon hits the drum
and it looks like

18:47.861 --> 18:49.560
Glitter comes jumping
off of it?

18:49.562 --> 18:52.530
In that documentary,
they pour water

18:52.532 --> 18:54.732
Into his drum kit,
and then during the solo,

18:54.734 --> 18:57.602
They light up the spray as it
just leaps up off the drum.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.170
So, I think, I hope,

18:59.172 --> 19:01.239
I'm duplicating
the blood pattern

19:01.241 --> 19:03.541
From the crime scene.
What do you think?

19:07.246 --> 19:08.713
I'll be damned.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.615
All right,
back up, though.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.417
How do you figure the blood got
on that drum in the first place?

19:13.419 --> 19:14.519
From lex young.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.920
I think the combination
of the alcohol,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.388
The cocaine, the pills,

19:17.390 --> 19:18.723
Him thinking he has
a music deal,

19:18.725 --> 19:20.525
Put that in combination
with the adrenaline

19:20.527 --> 19:22.160
Of being onstage,

19:22.162 --> 19:24.562
He thought at some point
that he was a rock god.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.464
<i>Rock goddesses were gonna fall</i>
<i>from the sky.</i>

19:26.466 --> 19:28.299
No, thanks!

19:28.301 --> 19:29.634
<i>But when they weren't</i>
<i>in the mood,</i>

19:29.636 --> 19:31.235
<i>He got enraged.</i>

19:33.372 --> 19:34.605
Oh, my god!

19:34.607 --> 19:36.541
(screaming)

19:36.543 --> 19:38.643
<i>And then he just</i>
<i>went back to playing.</i>

19:38.645 --> 19:41.179
(yelling)

19:44.816 --> 19:47.451
But we still have
a lot of it left to do.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.354
We didn't find a bloody drum kit
at the crime scene.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.689
Any ideas?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.925
Well, we might find the drums

19:53.927 --> 19:56.561
In the same place
we find tangerine.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.629
(glass clinking)

20:00.566 --> 20:01.866
(groans)
this place reeks.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.368
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.570
(groans)

20:05.572 --> 20:07.538
Well, at least we're
in the right place.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.408
Driver said he found the
limo bus a block that way.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.477
The fame experience studio
is just around the corner.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.947
Definitely promising.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.820
Hey.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.562
It's a drumstick.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.764
With blood on it.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.002
Brody:
You see that?

20:39.538 --> 20:41.239
Throw this over there?

20:41.241 --> 20:43.741
Yeah.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.980
(wheels squeaking)

20:53.485 --> 20:55.653
(sighs)

20:57.322 --> 20:58.556
(both groan)

20:58.558 --> 21:00.625
(coughing)

21:00.627 --> 21:02.660
Brody:
Bloody drum

21:02.662 --> 21:03.961
And a very bad smell.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.700
That's lex young,
the drummer.

21:11.604 --> 21:16.540
The fame experience is becoming
more like "hotel california."

21:16.542 --> 21:18.609
"you can check out
anytime you like,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.645
But you can never leave."

21:26.385 --> 21:27.918
Our drummer,
mr. Lex young,

21:27.920 --> 21:30.855
Sustained at least eight
sharp-force injuries.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.292
Wounds are consistent
with the stiletto knife

21:34.294 --> 21:35.693
Found at the crime scene.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.496
Henry processed the blood
on the drum?

21:38.498 --> 21:41.032
Yeah. It's definitely
mr. Young's.

21:41.034 --> 21:44.468
Got a wallet, doc.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.704
Phone, too.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.542
Looks like he made some friends
while he was in town.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.879
One friend in particular.

21:56.782 --> 22:00.518
Ooh, boy, that's tangerine,
our missing girl.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.553
Phillips: Maybe they made
a love connection.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.755
Although, if she was
a working girl,

22:04.757 --> 22:07.391
It was probably
one-sided.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.760
Torn up pieces of paper
in his wallet.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.796
Must've meant something to him.

22:14.766 --> 22:18.002
That looks like a lyric sheet,
handwritten.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.640
"'long road home,'
a song by lex young."

22:22.642 --> 22:24.942
He scribbled a
dedication underneath.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.977
"for tangerine."

22:26.979 --> 22:30.614
I doubt mr. Young tore up
his own song.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.116
It's bad for him, good for us.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.885
Yeah, 'cause if tangerine
tore it up,

22:34.887 --> 22:36.487
That means she touched it.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.989
"long road home" could be
a short road to finding her.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.460
♪

23:02.714 --> 23:04.448
(computer trills, beeps)

23:09.788 --> 23:12.456
So, we got an I.D.
On tangerine.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.692
Surprise, surprise,
it's not her real name.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.427
Russell:
Angela glenn.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.863
Arrests for solicitation,
pandering

23:18.865 --> 23:20.097
And fraud.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.767
At first, we thought
she was our next victim.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.735
Turns out, she may have
been involved

23:24.737 --> 23:27.071
In the murders of marcy cody
and lex young.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.407
All right,
tell me what you got.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.509
Well, let's start with
lex young's phone

23:31.511 --> 23:34.645
And a series of photos
of him with tangerine.

23:34.647 --> 23:37.948
And the time stamp says that
they first met six days ago.

23:37.950 --> 23:42.887
A dream come true, right?
Lex young meets his muse.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.089
That night, he goes home
and writes and records

23:45.091 --> 23:47.425
A song dedicated to her.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.560
And then, poof, all of a sudden,
he's got a record deal.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.061
Yeah, what are the odds
of that happening?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.730
100-to-one
it's a scam.
Yeah.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.765
And we've got a lead on
who might be behind it.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.701
Couple of hours ago,
a check transaction cleared

23:57.703 --> 24:00.004
Lex young's personal account.

24:00.006 --> 24:03.207
$50,000 written to
cogitator music international.

24:03.209 --> 24:07.144
Deposited by the owner himself,
one alex gradenko.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.947
I'm assuming you've checked up
on the label.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.116
Yeah, it's an offshore account
in belize.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.517
Belize!

24:13.519 --> 24:15.953
Which brings us
to lex young's e-mail.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.556
He and gradenko have been
communicating

24:18.558 --> 24:19.857
For the past four days.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.792
"mr. Young,

24:21.794 --> 24:23.794
"your demo is incredible.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.896
"excited to meet you
in person finally.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.966
"however, we have a problem
with our digital distribution

24:28.968 --> 24:31.902
"that has resulted
in unexpected costs.

24:31.904 --> 24:36.841
"we will need $50,000
to avoid any unwanted delay

24:36.843 --> 24:38.876
In the release
of your single."

24:38.878 --> 24:41.245
That sounds like your classic
nigerian e-mail scam.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.948
You give us a little now, we'll
give you so much more later.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.684
That lex young received
from cogitator music?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.719
Right. That was just
the come-on.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.521
Like a sweet young tangerine

24:50.523 --> 24:52.790
Fawning over an aging,
wannabe rock star.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.826
Okay, so how does
the con turn into murder?

24:55.828 --> 24:58.762
Well, I'm thinking that the torn
lyric sheet that we found

24:58.764 --> 25:00.931
Says that tangerine,
at some point,

25:00.933 --> 25:03.634
Maybe lost her stomach
for the grift.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.836
And maybe even started
to feel for her mark.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.606
So, lex young realizes maybe
that he's being conned,

25:08.608 --> 25:10.508
So he confronts gradenko

25:10.510 --> 25:13.744
Gradenko kills him
to cover up the scam.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.980
And marcy cody's just
collateral damage.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.082
Okay, what about, uh, tangerine?
Her neighbors say

25:18.084 --> 25:19.917
She hasn't been around
for a couple days.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.185
So we have a broadcast out

25:21.187 --> 25:23.988
On her car and we're sitting
on her place.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.823
Russell: If I were her,
I'd be in the wind.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.858
(phone chimes)
if I were
this guy gradenko,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.560
I'd be in the wind, too.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.595
Uh, maybe not.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.901
I.S.P. Trace we ran on
gradenko's e-mails to lex young

25:36.903 --> 25:40.204
Came back to vegas,
not belize.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.541
And to a "cat" we all know.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.309
Brass:
<i>Marty "the cat" kirch.</i>

25:45.311 --> 25:46.710
Pleasure to meet you.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.112
Captain jim brass.
How are you?

25:48.114 --> 25:50.614
Or maybe I should say...
(speaks russian)

25:50.616 --> 25:51.882
Comrade gradenko.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.285
Captain, I can explain this...

25:54.287 --> 25:57.922
No explanation necessary,
really. This, you know...

25:57.924 --> 25:59.857
You got a really nice
side business here.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.192
The company provides
a taste of fame.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.595
And you provide
to would-be rockers

26:04.597 --> 26:07.665
The dream of alex gradenko,
record producer, right?

26:07.667 --> 26:11.936
Some poor schmuck gets to
dream of being discovered

26:11.938 --> 26:13.671
And getting
a record deal

26:13.673 --> 26:15.072
And becoming famous;
it's kind of slick.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.075
Exactly. That's why
I invented alexander gradenko.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.244
The world's best
record producer, right?

26:20.246 --> 26:23.047
Just like you said,
it's like selling dreams.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.716
Yeah. It's called
fraud, marty.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.685
I don't understand.
Well, you know,

26:27.687 --> 26:29.286
Lex young understood;
he understood the reality

26:29.288 --> 26:31.188
That you had scammed
him for 50 grand.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.625
Wait a minute.
I mean, you got it all wrong.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.694
Are you saying
that I killed lex young?
Did you?

26:36.696 --> 26:38.796
And what about marcy cody?
I mean, geez, that poor kid

26:38.798 --> 26:40.331
Just got in
the way, I guess.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.266
That poor kid was like
a daughter to me.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.034
You know, we're gonna find
the other girl, tangerine.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.270
We're gonna find her dead
or alive, and when we do,

26:46.272 --> 26:47.972
She's gonna have
a story to tell.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.707
Well, I sincerely hope
you do find her,

26:49.709 --> 26:51.809
Because the story
that she's gonna tell you

26:51.811 --> 26:53.711
Is that I didn't hire her.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.714
Lex young hired her.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.948
Lex young? Really?

26:57.950 --> 26:59.283
I thought you hired
all the groupies.

26:59.285 --> 27:03.854
Captain, when you're a client
and you go off the menu,

27:03.856 --> 27:05.723
I'm not gonna stop you.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.659
So if you're looking for
what happened to lex and marcy,

27:08.661 --> 27:12.930
Maybe you need to look
at tangerine

27:12.932 --> 27:15.165
And not me.
Why's that?

27:15.167 --> 27:17.935
Because he had that hooker
on his arm all weekend long.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.104
The last day of it,
they had this massive fight.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.372
That's why.
Oh, really?

27:21.374 --> 27:22.806
Do you know what it was about?

27:22.808 --> 27:24.074
I have no idea.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.277
But to me...
It's always about money.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.812
Yeah.

27:28.814 --> 27:32.950
Well, for me,
it's always about the crime.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.019
And you're under arrest,
marty, for fraud.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.353
For now.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.421
(laughs)

27:40.893 --> 27:44.294
I don't believe a
thing that guy says.
Well, truth is,

27:44.296 --> 27:46.196
We didn't find
any evidence that put him

27:46.198 --> 27:48.265
In the room at the time
of the murders, so...

27:48.267 --> 27:50.034
And the only people
who were there that night

27:50.036 --> 27:51.669
Are either dead, or in the wind,

27:51.671 --> 27:54.071
Or dead.
Captain?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.106
You got a visitor. He
said that it's important.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.274
Oh, yeah?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.843
Actually, he says
he's important.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.278
Captain, permission to board?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.680
Permission granted,

28:02.682 --> 28:03.814
Sailor.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.049
So you've met
officer mitchell?

28:05.051 --> 28:06.283
Yes, sir.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.919
That's csi russell.
This is gene simmons.

28:08.921 --> 28:09.953
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.321
Hey.
Yeah, nice to meet you.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.024
Wife's a huge fan
of your, um...

28:14.026 --> 28:16.360
Reality show.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.762
Oh. What about you?

28:18.764 --> 28:22.066
Uh, I'm more of a nature channel
kind of guy.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.235
Oh, nature's cool.
So, gene,

28:25.237 --> 28:27.237
What brings you by?
You paying a parking ticket?

28:27.239 --> 28:29.239
I bring you treasure.

28:29.241 --> 28:32.076
But first, a little
dna for your q and a.
Oh.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.911
I watch a lot
of cop shows.

28:33.913 --> 28:37.781
Okay, so... So, what's, uh...
What's the story behind these?

28:37.783 --> 28:39.783
Well, here's the deal.

28:39.785 --> 28:42.052
See, this girl gets my
number the other night.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.855
And, uh, I'm a gent.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.190
I never say no.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.059
Lo and behold, the phone
goes off this morning,

28:49.061 --> 28:51.929
And it's her, and she says,
"uh, hi. Do you remember me?"

28:51.931 --> 28:55.199
And I say, uh,
"honestly, no."

28:55.201 --> 28:57.935
And she says, "how can you
forget a name like tangerine?"

29:01.172 --> 29:03.440
Where is she now?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.042
Outside in my limo.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.844
Take her down.
I'll call you.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.412
Thank you very much, gene.

29:11.783 --> 29:14.985
I'm always at the service
of law enforcement.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.858
She doesn't look like
she could do it.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.427
Then again, she did take
a swing at gene simmons.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.162
Well, that's not
a huge surprise.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.196
He dimed her out.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.065
Doesn't make her
a murderer.

29:28.067 --> 29:31.001
So your money's on,
what, marty "the cat"?

29:31.003 --> 29:32.302
I don't know.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.238
Do you really think
a falling out

29:34.240 --> 29:36.306
Between a hooker
and a john could turn

29:36.308 --> 29:38.175
Into such a brutal homicide?

29:38.177 --> 29:39.910
Committed by the hooker?

29:39.912 --> 29:43.213
This kid, what,
goes into a rage,

29:43.215 --> 29:45.249
Wants to drum the john
out of this world?

29:45.251 --> 29:46.517
(phone chimes)
oh, seen crazier things.

29:46.519 --> 29:47.518
True.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.853
We need a why, d.B.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.990
I think we just got it.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.159
Text from henry.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.227
Okay.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.297
Been sitting here an hour.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.133
It's costing me money.
You wanted to talk?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.202
So, talk.
Or arrest me.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.471
Do something, so I can just
get the hell out of here.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.539
You're not going anywhere!

30:08.541 --> 30:09.873
You think you're here

30:09.875 --> 30:11.275
For solicitation?

30:11.277 --> 30:14.077
You're here for this,
and you're here for this.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.047
Now, we've done our homework;
we know your story.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.216
You had a single mom
who left you in foster care.

30:19.218 --> 30:23.187
A ward of the state
in a state-fun facility.

30:23.189 --> 30:27.024
I'd say you see people
really at their worst

30:27.026 --> 30:28.559
In places like that.

30:28.561 --> 30:32.196
You also grow up with
a propensity for violence.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.130
Would you
agree with me?

30:33.132 --> 30:34.198
Russell:
Look, tangerine,

30:34.200 --> 30:35.399
We ran your dna.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.202
You may not share
mr. Young's last name,

30:38.204 --> 30:42.272
But you do share
13 genetic markers with the guy.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.509
He's your father.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.445
Russell: But then, you
knew that, didn't you?

30:48.447 --> 30:50.347
Guy hires you for a week.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.250
Somewhere down the line,
you realize

30:53.252 --> 30:54.484
That he's your father.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.253
Brass: How'd you find
out the truth?

30:56.255 --> 30:58.188
So, you're in the hotel room
with lex young.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.058
How he came to vegas,
he met a woman,

31:01.060 --> 31:04.161
He had an infant daughter, and
he abandoned that little girl?

31:04.163 --> 31:07.064
And somehow, you pieced together
that that little girl was you?

31:07.066 --> 31:08.966
I mean, we understand.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.168
Hell, a jury would understand.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.903
Of course you went
a little crazy

31:12.905 --> 31:14.104
When you found out the guy

31:14.106 --> 31:15.305
You were sleeping with
was your father.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.640
That's not what happened!

31:16.642 --> 31:18.008
Okay, look, we just want
to help you out here.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.610
I didn't sleep with my father.

31:19.612 --> 31:22.179
I didn't kill him.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.181
Or anyone.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.316
(scoffs)

31:26.318 --> 31:29.219
You people don't know...
Anything.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.921
Well, then tell us
what we should know.

31:32.023 --> 31:34.524
Look, I thought he was just
some rich guy.

31:34.526 --> 31:38.195
Okay, he hired me
for the week, another date.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.296
Until it wasn't.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.898
Tangerine.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.233
That's a pretty name.
I like it.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.501
Do you want to know
how you got it?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.336
My mom told me it was a nickname

31:46.338 --> 31:49.573
My dad gave me when I was
little, before he took off.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.408
I'm sorry about that.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.943
Hey, it's...

31:52.945 --> 31:54.211
It's not your fault.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.479
It is.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.914
(scoffs)
what?

31:56.916 --> 31:59.316
I came to vegas
for you.

31:59.318 --> 32:02.219
There's no way
for me to make right

32:02.221 --> 32:05.322
What I did, but...
I want to try.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.258
What are you talking about?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.459
I've never been
very good

32:09.461 --> 32:12.963
With words;
there's, um, only one way

32:12.965 --> 32:14.231
That I've been able
to express myself.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.233
What the hell is this?

32:16.235 --> 32:18.135
It's something
I wrote for you.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.670
It's a song.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.271
(paper ripping)

32:21.273 --> 32:22.472
When was this?

32:22.474 --> 32:24.041
Monday night.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.475
Russell: Monday night?
Wait a minute.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.710
I don't...
I don't get this.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.378
Tuesday night,
the next night,

32:28.380 --> 32:30.647
You were seen leaving
the brimstone club

32:30.649 --> 32:33.450
With marcy cody
and your father,

32:33.452 --> 32:34.985
And you were
all friendly,

32:34.987 --> 32:37.454
And then one hour later,
they're both dead?

32:37.456 --> 32:38.622
I mean, help me
understand that.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.257
My dad came back to the club
that night.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.259
He apologized.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.027
I mean, my mom's dead.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.395
I didn't think I had anyone.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.298
It's something
I fantasized about

32:48.300 --> 32:49.733
Since I was a little girl.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.135
You know,
my dad coming back to us.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.572
I never thought it would
take this long, but...

32:55.574 --> 32:58.175
He said he just wanted
the chance to play me the song.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.510
And that girl, marcy,

33:00.512 --> 33:02.112
She just wanted to get
out of the club.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.380
So my dad got the keys

33:03.382 --> 33:06.283
To the limo,
and we went back to the studio.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.051
What happened then?

33:08.053 --> 33:10.220
My dad played me the song.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.190
It was nice.

33:14.459 --> 33:16.059
Said a producer was interested.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.394
He'd heard the demo

33:17.396 --> 33:19.229
And wanted my dad
to record another

33:19.231 --> 33:21.164
With backup vocals.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.467
My dad said someone was gonna
come by the studio later

33:23.469 --> 33:25.602
And help him out.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.105
I wished him luck,

33:28.107 --> 33:30.607
And I left.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.610
I swear...

33:33.612 --> 33:38.782
...My dad and marcy were alive
when I walked out of there.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.623
(computer trilling)

33:46.625 --> 33:48.325
So, these are
the recordings

33:48.327 --> 33:50.727
From the fame experience
studio, huh?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.629
Hodges: Marty kirch
turned them over.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.498
Must be some
great listening.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.767
(chuckles) I can load them
onto your ipod, if you like.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.301
No, thanks.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.437
The important
song is the one

34:00.439 --> 34:04.341
That was recorded at 3:12
the night of the murder.

And playing guitar.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.382
He put both of those
on the same track,

34:12.384 --> 34:14.384
Track one.

34:14.386 --> 34:18.355
His daughter said that another
vocalist was going to help.

34:18.357 --> 34:21.691
Well, it looks like there were
no other recordings. But...

34:21.693 --> 34:24.528
Look at the waveform
on this one.

microphone

34:41.780 --> 34:44.681
Can pick up a lot
of extraneous audio.

34:44.683 --> 34:49.352
So you're thinking that someone
was there recording vocals.

34:49.354 --> 34:50.687
Maybe our killer.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.422
And they erased
their track.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.125
But their vocals still
bled onto track one.

34:55.127 --> 34:57.394
(sighs) well, I'm not sure
we have enough here

34:57.396 --> 34:59.329
To be able
to identify the voice.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.630
We've got the
microphone.

35:00.632 --> 35:04.401

That night onstage
singing backup.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.615
Your dna's all over
that microphone.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.618
Respectfully-- a-and I don't
mean to tell you your job--

35:54.620 --> 35:57.654
But my dna on that
microphone proves nothing.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.523
I-I was singing into that mic
all week long.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.459
I know.
You know how I know?

36:03.427 --> 36:06.763
Organi chew organic gumballs.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.566
Green tint kind of proves
it was you.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.735
This is the color
you like, right?

36:11.737 --> 36:14.738
I read your band's rider.
I know you're the gumball guy.

36:14.740 --> 36:18.375
Found quite a few particles
of it in that microphone.

36:18.377 --> 36:21.611
And since you know how to do
my job so well...

36:23.214 --> 36:25.549
I'm sure you know
what that is, right?

36:25.551 --> 36:27.551
Um...
It's a trace report.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.818
You know
what that tells me?

36:28.820 --> 36:31.955
That tells me that the gum
contains xylitol.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.925
You know what xylitol is?
It's an organic sweetener.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.660
It comes from corn.

36:36.662 --> 36:39.196
Which is really good for us.
It can tell us a whole lot.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.665
'cause thanks to you,

And when measured
in concentrated levels,

36:50.909 --> 36:54.244
It can give me
a very specific timeline.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.379
Think of this gum,

36:56.381 --> 37:00.317
When chewed,
as a... As a body decomposing.

37:00.319 --> 37:04.487
Oxygen dissipates, muscles
stiffen at a certain rate.

37:04.489 --> 37:07.524
That's what gives us
the time of death.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.259
In your case,

37:09.261 --> 37:13.630
That's what gives us

37:19.638 --> 37:22.572
During the time
of the murders, arnold.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.641
So, here's what
I think happened.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.810
I think that
after tangerine left,

37:26.812 --> 37:29.412
You waltzed in,
and lex

37:29.414 --> 37:31.548
Was all too happy,

37:31.550 --> 37:34.551
Because he needed a little help
with the background vocals.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.719
Am I right?

37:37.555 --> 37:39.556
It's always background.
Yeah, yeah.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.624
How's that make you feel?

37:40.626 --> 37:41.691
Makes me really mad.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.727
Pisses you off, right?
Yeah.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.463
With every passing verse.
Mm-hmm.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.331
And he's like, what, uh,
"stop, do it again.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.667
This time,
with more feeling."
bastard!

37:50.669 --> 37:52.335
He thought he was phil collins,
you know?

37:52.337 --> 37:54.271
But I was better than he was.

37:54.273 --> 37:57.507
I was the heart and soul
of darwin's monkey.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.609
But lex always had
to call the shots--

37:59.611 --> 38:01.578
When we broke up, when we got

38:01.580 --> 38:03.613
Back together,
even this whole...

38:03.615 --> 38:05.682
Fame experience crap.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.285
I was sick of it, you know?
And I told him so!

38:08.287 --> 38:10.420
(guitar strumming)
(sniffs)

38:10.422 --> 38:11.588
Lex:
Arnold,

38:11.590 --> 38:13.390
What's your problem?

38:13.392 --> 38:15.558
You. You're my problem.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.760
You want to be front man?

38:16.762 --> 38:20.597
Lead? Your entire
existence is background.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.766
Now let's go again.

38:24.735 --> 38:25.869
(shouts)

38:25.871 --> 38:26.936
(grunting)

38:28.906 --> 38:30.407
I won't tell anybody!

38:30.409 --> 38:32.709
No!
(screams)

38:35.880 --> 38:38.915
(yelling)

38:38.917 --> 38:42.319
And afterwards, you dumped
her body in the limo and...

38:42.321 --> 38:45.455
Disposed of lex's body where
we wouldn't find it, right?

38:45.457 --> 38:48.391
It worked.

38:48.393 --> 38:51.361
For a while.

38:51.363 --> 38:54.397
I mean, you thought
lex killed her and...

38:54.399 --> 38:55.498
Ran off, right?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.634
But then...

38:57.636 --> 39:00.670
You found him.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.774
Even in death,
lex makes me look like a chump.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.346
You ever been in a band, man?

39:11.115 --> 39:13.583
Thought you were good?

39:13.585 --> 39:15.719
Lex was right.

39:15.721 --> 39:19.089
The only time I was ever really
alive was when we were together.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.691
Playing.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.761
And I swear...

39:25.696 --> 39:27.831
...We were really good.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.700
Well, arnold,

39:30.702 --> 39:33.703
Unfortunately for you,

39:33.705 --> 39:35.605
The music has stopped.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.609
(sobbing softly)

39:49.153 --> 39:52.789
Angela, I need
to talk to you.

39:55.693 --> 39:59.662
Your dad reached out,
tried to make things right.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.698
(sniffles softly)

40:01.700 --> 40:05.602
I feel bad about
what happened to him.

40:05.604 --> 40:09.439
So, as a favor
to your father,

40:09.441 --> 40:12.075
Or even
as a favor to me,

40:12.077 --> 40:14.611
You got
to stop the hustle.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.113
You got to ease out
of the street life.

40:17.115 --> 40:21.084
And do it now while
you're still young, because...

40:21.086 --> 40:23.753
It doesn't end pretty.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.189
You don't know me.

40:26.191 --> 40:29.559
I do.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.763
Yeah, I spent, um,

40:33.765 --> 40:37.901
A lot of my life being a cop
rather than being a dad.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.671
I made a mistake.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.741
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake.

40:44.743 --> 40:48.445
So, if you
get in a jam,

40:48.447 --> 40:51.648
You get in trouble,
you need some help,

40:51.650 --> 40:55.819
Or even if you just want to have
a cup of coffee, you call me.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.755
Thanks.
Oh.

40:58.757 --> 41:00.657
This is from your dad.

41:02.693 --> 41:04.527
