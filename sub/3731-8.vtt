02:17.256 --> 02:19.758
Do you know that feeling
when you're sitting in a movie theater

02:19.841 --> 02:21.718
and everyone's laughing at something

02:21.801 --> 02:23.929
- and you just don't get it?
- Yeah.

02:24.637 --> 02:26.598
Like all the time.

02:26.681 --> 02:28.683
This is where I'm at right now.

02:29.976 --> 02:33.897
I'm sitting looking at the sunrise,
the city,

02:33.980 --> 02:38.860
and I'm wondering, how can something
still look so beautiful

02:38.944 --> 02:41.321
after we saw what we saw?

02:43.073 --> 02:45.784
It just doesn't seem right.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.702
No, it doesn't.

03:30.996 --> 03:32.331
[softly] Are you all right, dear?

03:32.413 --> 03:35.334
- I need to use the ladies' room.
- Go on.

03:37.294 --> 03:40.421

04:05.905 --> 04:07.699
What happened to him?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.162
[sighs]

04:14.789 --> 04:17.792
It was... my fault.

04:21.921 --> 04:23.506
I wanted to prove something.

04:23.589 --> 04:26.968
I wanted to change something
that can't be changed.

04:27.052 --> 04:28.387
What?

04:31.890 --> 04:33.225
The past.

[ringing, buzzing]

04:42.608 --> 04:44.819

- [Daniela] It's me.

Dani?

04:49.074 --> 04:50.450
Daniela?

04:51.492 --> 04:54.037
- Where are you?
- [softly] I did it.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.040
I got my phone back.
Everything's fine. I fixed it.

04:57.123 --> 04:58.624
How do you know?

04:58.708 --> 05:00.835
How do you know
everything's going to be fixed?

05:02.045 --> 05:05.006
It just is, all right?

05:05.090 --> 05:07.800
- Why are you whispering?
- [whispers] Is she coming back?

05:07.884 --> 05:10.095
I just wanted you to know
you don't have to worry.

05:10.178 --> 05:13.014

- [sighs]
- What did she say?

05:21.773 --> 05:24.109
She said everything's going to be fine.

05:24.192 --> 05:25.777
She fixed it.

05:26.778 --> 05:27.904
She got the phone back.

05:29.739 --> 05:31.408
Is she still with him?

05:32.075 --> 05:34.119
- Huh?
- I don't know.

05:36.079 --> 05:38.831
[sighs] But this is good news, isn't it?

Fuck you!

You are looking very well, Elena.

06:16.369 --> 06:18.204
[Elena] Shithead, it's Motherfucker.

06:18.288 --> 06:21.833
[Jela] How do I tell them apart if you
keep calling all my friends motherfuckers?

06:21.916 --> 06:24.377
Oh, it's this motherfucker.

06:24.461 --> 06:25.878
Here.

done for me today.

06:46.149 --> 06:47.567
To the ancestors.

06:52.572 --> 06:55.367
You and Elena are not getting along?

06:55.450 --> 06:56.742
You have money. What's wrong?

06:56.826 --> 07:00.497
It's me. She hates me being home.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.415
[sighs]

07:02.499 --> 07:04.459
I can't blame her.

07:04.543 --> 07:06.211
I'm a stallion, Capheus.

07:06.294 --> 07:08.754
I go a little crazy locked up in a barn.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.509
Maybe it's time to go back to work.

07:13.885 --> 07:15.303
Are you serious?

07:17.222 --> 07:20.058
I realized today I cannot
keep doing what I'm doing.

07:21.142 --> 07:22.894
I've not yet told Mr. Kabaka this.

07:22.977 --> 07:26.398
I'm not sure I know how
to tell Mr. Kabaka this.

07:26.481 --> 07:28.525
But I cannot go back there again.

07:30.776 --> 07:33.071
The matatu is our work, eh?

07:33.988 --> 07:36.241
Real work. Clean work.

07:36.324 --> 07:37.658
[laughs]

07:37.783 --> 07:39.911
You saved my life once again,
my friend!

07:39.994 --> 07:42.663
Light of my life,
I'm going back to work!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.708
- Is that true?
- Ah.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.377
- [squeals]

07:53.132 --> 07:54.675
- [Capheus] Yeah, sure.
- Come, come, come!

07:56.052 --> 07:59.013
[softly] Ah... Oh, shit.

08:01.224 --> 08:02.350
[Sun sighs]

08:03.518 --> 08:06.896
You'll never have outside privilege
if you continue teaching me.

08:06.979 --> 08:08.565
I rarely get to go out.

08:08.648 --> 08:11.067
But today looks beautiful.

08:11.984 --> 08:13.152
It does.

08:14.195 --> 08:16.030
They let us paint outside.

08:16.781 --> 08:18.575
You like to paint?

08:18.658 --> 08:20.493
I don't mind staying in.

08:20.577 --> 08:22.412
Helping you makes time go quickly.

08:25.498 --> 08:26.707
Soo-Jin!

08:31.129 --> 08:32.838
Why does she choose you?

08:34.215 --> 08:35.383
I'm fast.

08:35.467 --> 08:38.177
I tried working more slowly once.

08:38.261 --> 08:39.804
That...

08:39.887 --> 08:42.014
That did not work out very well.

08:44.809 --> 08:46.852
[groans] Bitch!

08:47.728 --> 08:49.855
What are you doing?

08:49.939 --> 08:51.357
That's not done.

08:51.441 --> 08:53.359
Pick that up!

08:57.530 --> 08:59.282
Get back to your seat!

09:08.082 --> 09:14.339
My mother did not teach me to sew,
but my father taught me business.

09:14.422 --> 09:17.467
This is called "second mover advantage."

09:17.550 --> 09:21.387
The second mouse enjoys the cheese.

09:21.471 --> 09:25.558
Today, you go outside. She sews.

09:25.642 --> 09:27.686
Thank you.

09:29.437 --> 09:31.272
You've known him a long time.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.027
How did you meet?

09:38.988 --> 09:40.281
Detention.

09:44.410 --> 09:45.453
[door closes]

09:49.541 --> 09:53.127
Welcome to my office, newbie.
Have a seat.

10:03.179 --> 10:04.972
I'm Felix.

10:07.058 --> 10:08.059
Wolfgang.

10:08.142 --> 10:09.935
[giggles]

10:10.019 --> 10:11.103
Wolfgang?

10:12.480 --> 10:14.399
Nobody's named Wolfgang.

10:17.902 --> 10:21.072
OK... Wolfie.

10:21.155 --> 10:23.783
- What are you in for?
- Fighting.

10:24.867 --> 10:25.910
Cool.

10:28.413 --> 10:29.539
Where are you?

10:30.498 --> 10:31.624
At the movies.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.919
[sighs] With my family.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.713
Makes sense.

10:36.796 --> 10:38.130
Why?

10:39.924 --> 10:42.635
Felix loved the movies.

10:42.719 --> 10:45.471
We cut school to watch films all the time.

10:46.514 --> 10:50.643
[Conan] No one will remember
if we were good men or bad.

10:50.727 --> 10:53.896
All that matters is that
two stood against many.

10:53.979 --> 10:56.482
This film's a masterpiece.

10:56.566 --> 10:58.943
[Conan] So grant me one request.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.862
Grant me revenge!

11:01.946 --> 11:06.785
And if you do not listen...
then to hell with you!

11:19.547 --> 11:20.590
You finished!

11:22.801 --> 11:24.719
I did.

11:24.803 --> 11:26.429
Thank you for teaching me.

11:26.512 --> 11:28.264
No, thank you.

11:28.347 --> 11:32.017
This is our mural of happier times.

11:32.101 --> 11:34.019
I'm painting my three sisters.

11:35.938 --> 11:37.231
I miss them.

11:39.024 --> 11:41.193
Do you miss your family?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.446
No.

11:44.739 --> 11:46.699
I miss my dog.

11:51.746 --> 11:53.748
You're welcome to paint your dog.

11:55.458 --> 11:56.751
Or anything else.

11:59.671 --> 12:03.675
Sometimes... it feels good to remember.

12:06.552 --> 12:09.180
I don't know why he liked me.

12:09.263 --> 12:13.100
In those days, when we moved
from East to West Berlin,

12:13.184 --> 12:15.311
I was the kid everyone hated.

12:17.396 --> 12:20.274
Hey, you! Commie!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.861
Your shitty country is ruining ours.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.612
Get the hell out!

12:24.696 --> 12:25.946
You don't belong here!

12:26.030 --> 12:27.114
[spits]

12:27.198 --> 12:28.574
You better go.

12:28.658 --> 12:30.159
- No!
- Go!

12:31.285 --> 12:33.078
[boys laughing]

12:34.789 --> 12:38.710
My dad says you're
costing us billions in taxes.

12:38.793 --> 12:41.587
You're going to start
paying us back... now.

12:41.671 --> 12:43.172
Come and get it!

12:44.632 --> 12:45.925

"No one will remember

You're dead!

"Only that two stood against many."

13:13.118 --> 13:14.787
[panting]

13:14.871 --> 13:17.373
That was your childhood?

13:17.456 --> 13:19.124
No. [soft chuckle]

13:19.208 --> 13:23.212
That was nothing... compared to my father.

13:23.295 --> 13:25.089
[tableware clatters]

13:25.172 --> 13:27.425
Life is simple, boys.

13:32.388 --> 13:39.311
Life is just five things:
eating, drinking, shitting, fucking...

13:40.479 --> 13:42.857
and fighting for more.

13:47.486 --> 13:48.446
[groans softly]

13:49.321 --> 13:50.740
[Wolfgang weeps softly]

13:50.823 --> 13:53.242
I didn't say anything about crying.

13:54.368 --> 13:56.203
Crying is for bitches.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.292
That what you are?

14:02.752 --> 14:03.962
A little bitch?

14:11.761 --> 14:14.722
"Conan, what is best in life?"

14:15.514 --> 14:17.266
He's crazy.

14:20.728 --> 14:24.565
"To crush your enemies,
to see them driven before you!"

14:28.987 --> 14:30.947
He would do anything for you.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.365
[sighs]

14:33.449 --> 14:34.450
He's my brother.

14:39.664 --> 14:42.374
And not by something
as accidental as blood...

14:43.584 --> 14:45.503
by something much stronger.

14:47.296 --> 14:48.756
What?

14:52.176 --> 14:53.928
By choice.

15:04.438 --> 15:06.273
Is that your mother and you?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.276
She took me to the Spring Festival.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.529
We had ice cream.

15:12.321 --> 15:13.781
[drops paint can]

15:14.365 --> 15:16.575
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:16.659 --> 15:18.744
It was an accident.

15:21.372 --> 15:23.749
I know people like you.

15:25.543 --> 15:28.128
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.257
Not better or worse, just different.

15:32.341 --> 15:35.135
You got a smart mouth.

15:36.261 --> 15:41.893
Only if one assumes that a master's
in economics constitutes a smart mouth,

15:41.976 --> 15:44.603
as opposed to educated.

15:44.687 --> 15:47.481
Many educated people are quite stupid,

15:47.565 --> 15:52.111
and many stupid people
like to start fights for no good reason

15:52.194 --> 15:54.739
on a truly beautiful day.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.200
Let us not ruin it.

16:00.202 --> 16:03.706
Only thing I want to ruin
is that smart mouth.

16:13.758 --> 16:15.843
Stop fighting.
I don't want to hurt you.

16:15.927 --> 16:17.261

Aah!

[cries out]

16:42.912 --> 16:44.872
- Aah!
- [grunting]

16:44.956 --> 16:47.499
- [guard] Hey, hey, hey!
- [whistle trilling]

17:10.355 --> 17:11.941
[keys jingling]

17:25.746 --> 17:27.289
[Will] Oh.

17:30.793 --> 17:32.670
I was worried about you.

17:32.753 --> 17:34.379
I'm OK.

17:36.132 --> 17:38.300
You still in London?

17:40.970 --> 17:42.429
I'm home.

17:49.228 --> 17:50.562
[chuckles]

17:53.024 --> 17:54.441
This is where I grew up.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.154
Let me show you.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.245
This is the piano where
my dad practices every morning.

18:07.955 --> 18:10.457
When I was little, I used to lay
on this rug with my coloring book,

18:10.541 --> 18:11.416
listening to him.

18:13.752 --> 18:15.087
When I think of the word "happy,"

18:15.213 --> 18:17.589
that rug is the first thing
that comes into my head.

18:18.382 --> 18:19.967
Your dad's kind of a big deal, huh?

18:21.593 --> 18:22.636
Mm-hm.

18:24.429 --> 18:26.640
Especially in Iceland.

18:26.724 --> 18:31.020
Icelanders really like it if you get
famous somewhere else and then come back.

18:31.103 --> 18:32.646
They respect you more that way.

18:35.191 --> 18:36.817
Oh, is that your mom?

18:40.112 --> 18:41.613
She's beautiful.

18:43.032 --> 18:44.324
She was.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.828
Oh, she passed away.

18:47.912 --> 18:49.371
Mm-hm.

18:50.372 --> 18:53.209
- Sorry.
- Are you talking to me, honey?

18:53.292 --> 18:55.627
No, I was just talking to myself.

18:56.837 --> 18:58.338
Here you go.

18:58.422 --> 19:00.340
- Still black with one sugar?
- Thanks, Dad.

19:00.424 --> 19:02.885
- That's how I take my coffee, too.
- [chuckles]

19:02.968 --> 19:05.221
- I've gotta go.
- OK.

19:05.304 --> 19:06.597
You're home.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.225
- Oh, I can't believe it.
- [chuckles]

19:09.308 --> 19:11.185
- See you tonight.
- See you later.

19:12.728 --> 19:14.563
[Will] He seems like a nice man.

19:14.646 --> 19:16.190
He is.

19:18.234 --> 19:20.152
Why did you stay away so long?

19:23.114 --> 19:24.823
Oh, you don't have to explain it.

19:24.907 --> 19:27.243
I ask way too many questions.
Bad cop habit.

19:28.911 --> 19:32.248
A lot of things that are
hard to talk about happened here.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.252
[door opens]

19:43.675 --> 19:47.054
[softly] We know what you did for Soo-Jin.

19:50.975 --> 19:52.726
[door closes]

20:38.730 --> 20:41.275
So, this is your home?

20:41.359 --> 20:42.651
Yeah.

20:42.734 --> 20:46.488
Yeah, it's kinda small, you know?

20:46.571 --> 20:48.448
Cops don't get paid a lot.

20:48.532 --> 20:49.908
I like it.

20:51.576 --> 20:54.038
[gasps] This is so cool.

20:54.872 --> 20:56.165
[gasps]

20:56.248 --> 20:57.499
Wow.

21:00.002 --> 21:02.004
You should come to America sometime.

21:02.796 --> 21:04.215
Chicago's got a great music scene.

21:04.298 --> 21:09.387
Uh, jazz, blues, house... I could show you
around the city before you even got here.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.847
I could show you around Reykjavik.

21:14.308 --> 21:15.893
So cool.

21:15.976 --> 21:18.396
I want to see the volcano
no one can pronounce the name of.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.938
Eyjafjallajokull?

21:20.981 --> 21:22.066
God bless you.

21:22.149 --> 21:23.525
[both chuckle]

21:23.608 --> 21:27.029
- [train rumbling]
- Oh, my God, what is that?

21:29.781 --> 21:31.409
You sleep here?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.577
[Will] You get used to it.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.996
Oh, my God! [chuckles]

21:39.375 --> 21:40.709
Wow!

23:04.001 --> 23:06.003
The fuck you doing, Gorski?

23:08.964 --> 23:11.175
Huh? [mumbles]

23:12.384 --> 23:14.761
Everything is so much better now.

23:14.845 --> 23:18.307
- Yes, so much better.
- Uh, we spoke to the astrologer,

23:18.390 --> 23:21.519
and he says that the horoscope
for the new wedding date

23:21.601 --> 23:23.354
is even better than the last one.

23:23.437 --> 23:25.439
- The last one was not bad.
- No, no, not bad.

23:25.523 --> 23:27.774
- But this is better.
- So much better.

23:27.858 --> 23:31.153
Clearly, the gods wanted it this way.

23:31.236 --> 23:35.199
So, uh, you wish
to use the temple of Ganesha?

23:35.282 --> 23:36.992
Yes.

23:37.075 --> 23:41.121
Since I was a child, I have always
felt a closeness to Ganesha,

23:41.205 --> 23:45.000
that he sees through my eyes
and I see through his.

23:47.752 --> 23:52.216
- [food sizzling]
- [mother hums indistinctly]

24:11.443 --> 24:14.863
I can't remember the last time I smelled
your sukuma wiki and ugali.

24:14.946 --> 24:17.824
Ah. [chuckles]
I'm feeling much better.

24:18.742 --> 24:20.869
But you are far too thin.

24:20.952 --> 24:23.121
[resumes humming]

24:32.923 --> 24:35.384
It makes my heart sing
to see you cooking again.

24:36.385 --> 24:39.471
You were never good
at hiding your emotions.

24:44.809 --> 24:46.520
What is troubling you, my son?

24:49.147 --> 24:53.235
This medicine...
the man I was getting it from...

24:55.946 --> 24:58.240
I won't be able to get it
from him anymore.

25:03.787 --> 25:08.417
Troubles like this seem far less troubling
on a full stomach.

25:12.212 --> 25:15.924
- [floor creaks]
- Family is so important.

25:16.007 --> 25:19.136
- What do you want?
- I had a family once.

25:19.219 --> 25:21.639
- Get out!
- Capheus!

25:21.721 --> 25:23.390
I had a sister.

25:25.142 --> 25:27.185
We were tight, like you and moms here.

25:28.437 --> 25:31.690
One day, me and Mr. Kabaka
had a disagreement.

25:33.150 --> 25:35.569
I came home and she's lying there,

25:35.653 --> 25:39.573
a wire around her throat,
her scalp torn off.

25:43.243 --> 25:46.622
That's what Mr. Silas Kabaka taught me.

25:48.666 --> 25:52.794
- Love ain't nothing but a black hole.
- No, no!

25:56.756 --> 25:59.301
- What do you want?
- [scoffs]

25:59.384 --> 26:01.261
Come on, hero.

26:01.345 --> 26:04.014
What does every person on this planet want

26:04.097 --> 26:07.184
whose life has been fucked up
by another person?

26:07.267 --> 26:09.811
What the fuck do you think we want?!

26:10.770 --> 26:12.690
What does he want?

26:12.772 --> 26:14.107
And why here?

26:14.191 --> 26:15.900
Why did he want to meet here?

26:15.984 --> 26:19.237
[sighs] She said it was halfway.
She wanted to make it easy.

26:19.321 --> 26:22.907
Oh, come on, Hernando. This is Joaquin.
He wanted us to meet in public.

26:22.991 --> 26:25.910
- Maybe you should wait in the car.
- I think I should wait in the car.

26:25.994 --> 26:27.621
Yes. Yes.

26:46.097 --> 26:47.224
Hi.

26:47.307 --> 26:49.643
- Dani...
- [Daniela chuckles softly]

26:50.769 --> 26:52.229
Thanks.

26:53.146 --> 26:54.773
Sorry it's so late.

26:55.649 --> 26:57.442
It's the only time he could do it.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.570
It's not a problem.

27:03.490 --> 27:06.702
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm good.

27:14.084 --> 27:16.127
He hit you.

27:16.211 --> 27:19.172
We were... negotiating.

27:20.215 --> 27:22.718
No, no. This is wrong.
You cannot go back to that asshole--

27:22.801 --> 27:25.763
I told that asshole I would marry him
if he left you alone.

27:26.597 --> 27:27.681
[Hernando] What?

27:29.307 --> 27:30.475
Lito!

27:36.064 --> 27:38.858
Hernando, no. No, no, no,
don't worry about me.

27:38.942 --> 27:41.111
What? This is crazy. Come on!

27:41.194 --> 27:42.571
What?

27:43.530 --> 27:48.410
We make choices... and life
has a way of making us pay for them.

27:48.493 --> 27:51.996
That's a line from
The Price of Life is Death.

27:52.748 --> 27:55.208
And you were so great in it.

27:57.127 --> 27:59.671
The world is inspired
by your movies, Lito,

27:59.755 --> 28:02.215
and I want you to
continue making them, OK?

28:04.843 --> 28:07.679
[sighs] Dani...

28:07.763 --> 28:10.474
Hernando, I'll be fine.

28:11.725 --> 28:16.396
If life has taught me anything,
it's that... I can take a punch.

28:19.775 --> 28:22.527
[sighs] Goodbye.

28:23.445 --> 28:25.363
Don't have too much fun without me.

28:28.533 --> 28:30.118
[engine races]

29:02.150 --> 29:04.736
- What am I going to do? I don't know.
- Yes, you do!

29:05.654 --> 29:09.366
You cannot give them the child.
You know that!

29:09.449 --> 29:11.326
If I don't, they will come back.

29:11.409 --> 29:12.452
You've heard them.

29:13.995 --> 29:17.248
That's what men do, they make threats.

29:17.332 --> 29:21.044
And you, more than anyone, know they have
the ability to carry those threats out.

29:21.127 --> 29:25.256
And you, more than anyone...
you know that their threats

29:25.340 --> 29:30.762
and even their violence...
cannot touch the things that matter.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.393
[sighs]

29:39.938 --> 29:45.109
Mama... is it completely
crazy to realize...

29:46.319 --> 29:49.072
even after gangsters
have threatened your life...

29:50.699 --> 29:52.242
how lucky you are?

29:56.580 --> 29:57.581
Not at all.

30:02.753 --> 30:04.796
[sighs] Not at all.

30:15.098 --> 30:18.852
- Baby O'Riley!
- Ah! Sven!

30:18.936 --> 30:19.937
It's been so long.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.189
- Riley, it's good to see you.
- You, too.

30:27.778 --> 30:29.279
How's the boat?

30:30.071 --> 30:34.868
Uh, it creaks, it groans.
Not as fast as it used to be.

30:36.578 --> 30:39.080
- We have that in common.
- [chuckles]

30:41.458 --> 30:42.584
[both] Skoal.

30:45.963 --> 30:48.047
It's so good to see you, Riley.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.676
For weeks, all your father's talked about
is you coming home.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.929
We're all happy to have you back.

30:54.012 --> 30:56.264
It's so nice to be back.

30:58.141 --> 31:00.018
This is your home, after all.

31:01.645 --> 31:02.938
Born right there.

31:04.940 --> 31:07.358
Ellen and I still laugh about that night.

31:08.652 --> 31:10.695
Gunnar won't let me buy a new phone.

31:10.779 --> 31:14.532
- He calls it the umbilicus.
- Does it even work anymore?

31:15.366 --> 31:17.076
I have a cousin in the highlands.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.579
We have the last two rotaries in Iceland.

31:19.663 --> 31:20.914
[chuckles softly]

31:22.081 --> 31:24.876
- Is your dad coming over?
- No, he's practicing.

31:26.419 --> 31:29.339
- Big day tomorrow.
- Mm. [soft chuckle]

31:33.217 --> 31:35.720
Sven, you know I don't drive anymore.

31:37.514 --> 31:41.559
Whenever, wherever,
just knock on my door.

31:43.561 --> 31:44.938
Thank you.

31:52.946 --> 31:57.283
Don't ask me how I know this,
but that woman right there is Nomi Marks.

31:57.367 --> 32:00.119
She was scheduled for a brain operation,
she disappeared.

32:00.203 --> 32:03.665
- This is the federal BOLO for her.
- [taps keys]

32:04.833 --> 32:07.502
And the guy she's talking to
is Niles Bolger.

32:07.585 --> 32:09.546
He had the same brain operation
two years ago.

32:09.629 --> 32:14.092
He's now living as a complete vegetable
at Nightingale's, until last night.

32:14.175 --> 32:16.386
Do I even want to know
how you're accessing this shit?

32:16.469 --> 32:19.514
I used my dad's old captain's clearance
for the requisition.

32:19.597 --> 32:21.265
Oh, my God.

32:22.266 --> 32:24.477
Yesterday, Bolger receives a package.

32:24.561 --> 32:26.479
The FedEx guy doesn't
know what to do with it.

32:26.563 --> 32:29.315
I know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna bury us with this.

32:29.399 --> 32:30.567
Watch this.

32:34.654 --> 32:35.697
Whoa.

32:35.780 --> 32:39.576
Last night, a guy who couldn't drink
from a coffee cup without drooling

32:39.659 --> 32:40.911
went on a shooting spree.

32:40.994 --> 32:43.329
One of the people he killed
before eating his own gun

32:43.413 --> 32:45.582
is the doctor who performed
the surgery on him,

32:45.665 --> 32:48.543
and was scheduled to do
the exact same thing to Nomi Marks.

32:48.626 --> 32:52.463
OK, if this was an episode of CSI,
I'm hooked,

32:52.547 --> 32:55.592
but cut to the goddamn chase and tell me
what the fuck this has to do with us.

32:55.675 --> 32:58.595
The company that paid Dr. Metzger
to perform those surgeries,

32:58.678 --> 33:00.680
that paid for the long-term care
of Niles Bolger,

33:00.847 --> 33:03.391
is the exact same company
that rented the white van

33:03.474 --> 33:06.394
that made one of the most dangerous
terrorists in America disappear.

33:07.604 --> 33:08.855
And this company is called?

33:08.939 --> 33:12.400
BPO, the Biologic
Preservation Organization.

33:12.483 --> 33:16.362
"A multi-national research group
studying the human genome

33:16.446 --> 33:20.075
in the search for positive
and consequential mutations."

33:20.158 --> 33:22.326
Well, that doesn't sound
sinister at all.

33:22.410 --> 33:23.661
These guys are seriously funded.

33:23.745 --> 33:27.665
I'm finding embeds to DARPA,
the World Science Foundation, the WHO--

33:27.749 --> 33:30.376
How are you able to access
their financial records?

33:33.379 --> 33:35.840
You're the guy that helped me
get out of the hospital.

33:36.841 --> 33:39.052
- That's right.
- What guy?

33:39.970 --> 33:42.555
He's standing right there
and he's a cop.

33:42.639 --> 33:44.849
Chicago PD.
A lot of that stuff is illegal.

33:44.933 --> 33:46.810
So is using your father's
clearance codes

33:46.893 --> 33:48.937
to access federal security information.

33:49.020 --> 33:50.480
How did you know about that?

33:50.563 --> 33:51.731
Know what?

33:53.024 --> 33:54.651
I'm not sure.

33:54.734 --> 33:58.071
OK, you've having a conversation
with a cop in Chicago right now?

33:58.155 --> 33:59.823
Yeah, I guess I am.

33:59.906 --> 34:02.325
Cool.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.661
FaceTime without a phone.

34:04.744 --> 34:07.080
I mean, not exactly.
We can know things and feel things.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.874
She can't hear you.

34:09.958 --> 34:12.002
Who the fuck you talkin' to, man?

34:12.752 --> 34:14.295
Noth-- I'm just talking to myself.

34:14.378 --> 34:17.423
You were at the shooting last night?

34:17.507 --> 34:18.716
You've killed us all.

34:21.552 --> 34:24.555
The only reason they would do something
like that is if they felt threatened.

34:24.639 --> 34:25.890
That means we're getting close.

34:26.724 --> 34:30.854
It also means that if they have
no problem killing their own people,

34:30.937 --> 34:33.023
then they'll have no problem killing us.

34:36.317 --> 34:38.987
Did you find anything
on Metzger's hard drive?

34:39.070 --> 34:41.865
So you know about the hard drive,
but you don't know what's on it?

34:41.948 --> 34:44.784
No one gave me a rule book here.
I'm just trying to go with it.

34:45.451 --> 34:49.539
Uh... Basically, they've been
paying this guy a butt-load of money

34:49.622 --> 34:51.666
to fly all over the world
and lobotomize people.

34:51.749 --> 34:54.127
I think he hooked up
with the company when--

34:54.211 --> 34:58.840
When he was a medical student
at the University of Chicago.

34:58.923 --> 35:00.217
[doorbell rings]

35:00.299 --> 35:01.467
- Mom!
- That picture.

35:01.551 --> 35:03.302
- Wait.
- [mother] Coming.

35:03.386 --> 35:05.638
- I know that guy.
- [Will] How?

35:05.722 --> 35:07.974
When Bolger put the gun in his mouth,

35:08.058 --> 35:12.979
I saw a reflection in the mirror
that wasn't his.

35:13.063 --> 35:15.356
- It was that guy.
- [door opens]

35:17.483 --> 35:19.027
I'm Dr. Friedmann.

35:21.905 --> 35:24.824
Senior Officer with the Biologic
Preservation Organization.

35:24.908 --> 35:27.285
- [whispers] That voice...
- [man continues speaking softly]

35:27.368 --> 35:28.369
I know that voice.

35:28.452 --> 35:31.330
I thought Nomi
was still in the hospital.

35:31.414 --> 35:33.250
I know you think
you're doing the right thing,

35:33.374 --> 35:37.879
trying to protect someone you care about,
but this woman has a terrible disease...

35:37.962 --> 35:39.463
- [whispers] It's him!
- Who?

35:39.547 --> 35:41.091
It's that guy.

35:41.174 --> 35:43.218
[whispers] He says that the guy
at the door is that guy!

35:43.301 --> 35:46.012
So, for your safety, we are putting you
into protective custody.

35:46.096 --> 35:48.472
- What?
- Don't look at him.

35:48.556 --> 35:51.101
- Why?
- Jonas told me that's how he hunts.

35:51.184 --> 35:53.352
I have a warrant to search these premises,

35:53.436 --> 35:56.231
and if you interfere,
you will be arrested and prosecuted

35:56.314 --> 35:58.566
- to the full extent of the law.
- You've gotta go right now.

35:58.649 --> 36:01.194
- You can't do this.
- Oh, yes, we can.

36:01.278 --> 36:03.905
No! What are you doing? No!

36:03.988 --> 36:06.866
What are you-- No, wait!
You can't do this!

36:07.408 --> 36:10.328
[mother shouts] Amanita! Amanita!

36:10.411 --> 36:12.914
[softly] OK, out the window,
over the balcony.

36:12.997 --> 36:14.665
- The alley will take you to Corbett.
- No.

36:14.749 --> 36:16.584
- You have to come with me.
- No. You need time.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.211
I'll stall them. Go!

36:18.295 --> 36:20.213
Go, honey! Go!

36:26.469 --> 36:27.678
Oh, my God.

36:30.098 --> 36:32.892
[panting] Fuck.

36:32.976 --> 36:34.227
Oh, my God. Neets.

36:35.686 --> 36:38.064
Um... Um... OK.

36:38.148 --> 36:39.899
- [pounding on door]
- [whispers] Shit.

36:39.983 --> 36:42.319
- [loudly] Is that you, Mom?
- I'm a federal agent. Open the door.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.695
- A federal agent?
- [pounding on door]

36:44.779 --> 36:48.283
- [man] Open the door, ma'am, now!
- Uh... I'm, uh...

36:48.366 --> 36:50.285
kinda in the middle of something.

36:51.995 --> 36:54.622
[shrieks] What the fuck?

36:54.705 --> 36:57.167
I am changing my tampon,
you fucking pervert!

36:57.250 --> 37:00.337
- Please come with me.
- Can I finish, or do you want this, too?

37:00.419 --> 37:01.879
- [stammers]
- Huh? Huh?

37:01.963 --> 37:04.548
You want it? You want it? Fucking take it!

37:09.137 --> 37:11.348
- Get eyes on the back alley.
- Copy that.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.738
- Stop! Don't move!
- Oh, God.

37:27.822 --> 37:29.115
[man] Hands in the air!

37:31.826 --> 37:35.205
Oh, my God. [panting]
I don't want to go back to the hospital.

37:35.288 --> 37:36.580
Cop guy, where are you?

37:38.416 --> 37:40.584
- What are you looking for?
- It's the feds. They found her.

37:40.668 --> 37:44.088
- How do you know?
- Gorski, the captain's office, now!

37:44.172 --> 37:45.923
We've got her. Back of the hill.

37:46.007 --> 37:47.425
Someone, please help me.

37:50.553 --> 37:51.762
Stay calm.

37:51.846 --> 37:53.597
Are you in my head or are you here?

37:53.681 --> 37:55.141
I'm in Seoul. I was sleeping.

37:56.059 --> 37:57.352
Ah, shit!

37:57.435 --> 37:58.644
- Get on your knees!
- Oh...

37:58.728 --> 38:00.313
- Who are you?
- I'm Sun.

38:00.397 --> 38:01.731
We don't have time for this.

38:01.814 --> 38:02.899
He's gonna call for backup.

38:02.982 --> 38:04.150
Backup on Corbett.

38:04.234 --> 38:06.903
This guy's right-handed.
He's gonna go for your right wrist.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.406
- Now!
- [grunting]

38:10.114 --> 38:11.574
[grunts]

38:18.831 --> 38:19.749
Throw the gun.

38:21.167 --> 38:22.001
Get on the bike.

38:30.260 --> 38:32.511
- [tires screech]
- [horn honks]

38:33.512 --> 38:34.847
[Will] Is there a problem, Captain?

38:35.765 --> 38:36.891
Shut the door.

38:41.979 --> 38:43.981
[siren wailing]

38:59.080 --> 39:00.998
[tires screeching]

39:01.749 --> 39:03.042
[police officer] Stop her!

39:14.595 --> 39:15.430
[bike clatters]

39:18.308 --> 39:19.892
I don't know how to drive.

39:20.393 --> 39:21.769
[engine starts]

39:21.852 --> 39:22.895
I do.

39:23.438 --> 39:25.856
- [tires squealing]
- [siren continues]

39:35.658 --> 39:37.118
[Nomi gasps]

39:39.329 --> 39:41.622
- Are you crazy? Oh!
- I saw this in Hard Target.

39:41.705 --> 39:44.917
Jean-Claude attacked
when everyone thought he was going to run.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.463
[tires squealing]

39:55.636 --> 39:56.471
[grunting]

39:58.097 --> 39:59.557
Whoo!

39:59.640 --> 40:01.225
It worked better in the movie.

40:03.520 --> 40:07.690
Look, Gorski, this isn't a movie
or a fucking TV show.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.985
I gave you clear warning
that if you didn't follow orders,

40:11.068 --> 40:13.654
- there would be consequences.
- OK, but, can I explain?

40:13.737 --> 40:17.283
I can explain,
same way they explained it to me.

40:17.367 --> 40:19.076
You're suspended without pay.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.578
Captain.

40:20.661 --> 40:22.163
Captain, you know that is not fair.

40:22.246 --> 40:23.956
[scoffs]

40:24.040 --> 40:26.042
What the fuck you talkin' about, Gorski?

40:27.084 --> 40:28.294
Not fair?

40:28.378 --> 40:30.338
This is the real fuckin' world.

40:30.421 --> 40:32.549
Nothin's fair.

40:32.631 --> 40:36.511
Drop your badge, sign the paperwork,
get the fuck out.

40:43.184 --> 40:46.270
[dramatic choral music playing]

40:53.861 --> 40:55.654
It's El Caído.

41:05.248 --> 41:06.624
[sharp inhale]

41:06.707 --> 41:08.751
[whispers] You said he would come for you.

41:10.836 --> 41:14.465
A man must never be judged
by the length of his gun,

41:14.549 --> 41:16.384
or the size of his fortune.

41:20.679 --> 41:24.808
In the end, we'll all be judged
by the courage of our hearts.

41:24.892 --> 41:26.102
[guns cocking]

41:35.361 --> 41:36.446
And cut!

41:37.154 --> 41:39.115
Give me one more, please. The line!

41:39.198 --> 41:41.284
Lito, you're beautiful.

41:41.367 --> 41:43.119
- You sure?
- It's great, we're fine.

41:43.202 --> 41:45.121
We have it, OK?

41:45.204 --> 41:47.665
And your, uh... friend is here.

41:52.295 --> 41:54.422
Oh, yeah. My bodyguard. Yeah.

42:03.306 --> 42:05.891
- Hello, Kala.
- Papa-ji.

42:05.975 --> 42:08.936
- I had no idea you came to the temple.
- I don't.

42:09.019 --> 42:11.355
No, I came here to see you.

42:11.439 --> 42:15.151
- Can I have a word with you?
- Yes, of course.

42:15.234 --> 42:19.113
I was considering our conversation
about continuing the wedding as planned.

42:19.196 --> 42:22.659
It's just that, uh,
the events of the past few days

42:22.741 --> 42:26.078
have led me to... reconsider things.

42:27.330 --> 42:29.499
- Reconsider?
- Yes.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.960
You know, I don't believe in
gods and miracles.

42:33.043 --> 42:36.130
Our fates are governed
by the choices that we make.

42:36.213 --> 42:42.094
Others, of course, will argue that luck,
good or bad, is a factor, but I disagree.

42:42.178 --> 42:44.597
Luck can only offer an opportunity.

42:45.473 --> 42:48.184
But without the will
to make the right choice,

42:48.267 --> 42:53.523
luck would be as meaningless as...
as that elephant-headed god.

42:53.606 --> 42:58.986
To me, the idea of praying to a god
to somehow influence my own fate

42:59.069 --> 43:03.073
is both primitive and terribly sad.

43:03.157 --> 43:07.745
I'm sorry, I don't think this is the place
to have this conversation.

43:11.666 --> 43:13.167
Something's wrong?

43:20.799 --> 43:23.427
What is it? Is it Joaquin, right?

43:23.511 --> 43:25.179
- He's gonna blackmail me.
- No.

43:25.262 --> 43:26.847
No, no, I haven't heard from him.

43:27.724 --> 43:28.849
Is it Daniela?

43:28.932 --> 43:30.476
In a way.

43:32.645 --> 43:36.190
I guess, in a way, she reminded me of
the things I had allowed myself to forget

43:36.273 --> 43:38.317
because I feel so strongly about you.

43:39.860 --> 43:43.072
Hernando, your tone is scaring me.
What are you talking about?

43:44.407 --> 43:47.243
I love you, Lito.

43:47.326 --> 43:50.829
I love you more than I have ever
loved anyone in my life.

43:50.913 --> 43:52.749
I love you, too.

43:52.831 --> 43:56.210
But I can't be with someone
who allows someone else to be hurt

43:56.293 --> 43:58.546
in order to protect their career.

43:59.714 --> 44:02.841
- I wish it didn't end this way.
- It doesn't end this way.

44:02.925 --> 44:04.968
What are you talking about?
This isn't my fault.

44:05.052 --> 44:08.514
Hernando, she did this to herself.
She admitted it.

44:08.598 --> 44:11.100
You cannot leave me for that.
This is not fair.

44:11.183 --> 44:13.936
- I know it's not fair.
- So what do you want me to do?

44:14.019 --> 44:16.897
You want me to throw
my whole life down the toilet

44:16.980 --> 44:20.359
- because of a woman I barely know?
- I don't know what you should do, Lito.

44:21.611 --> 44:23.571
All I know is what I have to do.

44:26.699 --> 44:28.325
Are you gonna break up with me
because of her?

44:28.409 --> 44:31.370
- No, it's not her.
- Then what?

44:33.664 --> 44:34.998
"In the end...

44:36.751 --> 44:40.337
we will all be judged
by the courage of our hearts."

44:40.421 --> 44:43.716
It's a stupid line from a stupid movie.
Hernando, please.

44:46.302 --> 44:47.886
I'm sorry, Lito.

44:50.723 --> 44:53.517
- Goodbye.
- No, please, no. Please don't leave me.

44:53.601 --> 44:55.144
Hernando.

44:56.019 --> 44:57.020
Hernando.

44:58.355 --> 44:59.565
Hernando!

45:00.650 --> 45:02.025
[sighs]

45:05.362 --> 45:07.364
[whispers]
Hernando, please don't leave me, please.

45:10.660 --> 45:12.244
[sighs]

45:13.912 --> 45:15.456
[director] Here we go. Let's shoot!

45:20.628 --> 45:23.005
I was hoping that after
our conversation is over,

45:23.088 --> 45:24.882
when you pray to your Ganesha,

45:24.965 --> 45:30.012
he'll also tell you that what you are
going to do is the right thing to do.

45:30.095 --> 45:31.681
- What I am going to do?
- Mm.

45:31.764 --> 45:33.349
You are going to call up my son

45:33.432 --> 45:35.893
and you are going to tell him
that you cannot marry him.

45:35.976 --> 45:37.060
What?

45:37.144 --> 45:39.438
You know in your heart
that's the right thing to do.

45:39.522 --> 45:40.773
I could see it in your eyes.

45:40.857 --> 45:42.566
That's why you stopped the wedding,

45:42.650 --> 45:45.862
to keep yourself from
committing this terrible mistake.

45:45.944 --> 45:49.740
- That's not true. That is not why I--
- Of course-- Of course it is true.

45:49.824 --> 45:52.326
- I--
- It was a mistake for both our parts.

45:52.409 --> 45:54.704
I should have never given my blessing.

45:54.787 --> 45:57.956
But now, luck has given us
another opportunity to correct it.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.917
All we require is the will--

46:06.924 --> 46:10.052
[cries out]

46:10.135 --> 46:13.472
- No! [screams]
- [groans]

46:14.431 --> 46:17.685
[Kala screams] Help!

46:18.561 --> 46:19.812
[screams]

46:20.771 --> 46:22.314
Help!

46:23.816 --> 46:25.150
Papa-ji!

46:26.068 --> 46:27.444
Papa-ji!

46:27.528 --> 46:28.529
Papa-ji?

46:29.697 --> 46:31.657
Help! Help!

46:34.702 --> 46:36.787
Somebody! Help!
