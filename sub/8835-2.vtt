40:44.735 --> 40:48.364
"WE HAVE CARPETS IN EVERY
ROOM-- BOUGHTEN CARPETS.

40:48.364 --> 40:50.074
"WE HAVE 3 SETS OF DISHES:

40:50.074 --> 40:52.451
"ONE FOR EVERY DAY,
ONE FOR SUNDAY,

40:52.451 --> 40:53.911
AND ONE FOR WHEN SOMEONE--"

40:53.911 --> 40:56.038
[GIGGLING]

40:59.917 --> 41:03.420
"...FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL AND
VERY IMPORTANT COMES TO VISIT,

41:03.420 --> 41:05.589
WHICH WE'VE NEVER
EVEN USED YET."

41:05.589 --> 41:07.091
"WE HAVE REAL
LACE CURTAINS..."

41:08.509 --> 41:12.012
"AND 6 GENUINE
OIL PAINTINGS AND--"

41:12.012 --> 41:14.098
[LAUGHTER]

41:18.894 --> 41:20.020
[LAUGHTER STOPS]

41:22.022 --> 41:23.566
"AND 6 GENUINE OIL PAINTINGS,

41:23.566 --> 41:26.944
"AND I HAVE MY OWN ROOM,
AND WILLIE HAS HIS OWN.

41:26.944 --> 41:29.155
"ALL OF OUR FURNITURE
IS BOUGHTEN, TOO,

41:29.155 --> 41:31.031
"AND IT COST A WHOLE LOT.

41:31.031 --> 41:34.118
"IF I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH,
YOU'D PROBABLY FAINT DEAD AWAY.

41:34.118 --> 41:36.245
"BUT MY PA,
OLESON'S MERCANTILE,

41:36.245 --> 41:39.456
"SAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH
THINGS COST ISN'T PROPER,

41:39.456 --> 41:42.042
"BUT IT COST DEAR,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT,

41:42.042 --> 41:44.795
"AND IT'S THE NICEST FURNITURE
OF ANY FURNITURE

41:44.795 --> 41:47.965
IN ANY HOUSE
IN WALNUT GROVE."

41:47.965 --> 41:50.050
[APPLAUSE]

41:55.389 --> 41:57.016
THANK YOU, NELLIE.

41:57.016 --> 41:59.310
AND NOW WE'LL HEAR
FROM LAURA INGALLS.

42:19.663 --> 42:20.873
"MY MOTHER."

42:22.208 --> 42:24.835
MY SISTER MARY
IS GOING TO TELL YOU

42:24.835 --> 42:29.006
HOW PA BROUGHT US WEST
AND HOW HARD HE WORKED,

42:29.006 --> 42:31.133
AND I DON'T MEAN TO TAKE
ANYTHING FROM HIM

42:31.133 --> 42:35.512
BY TELLING YOU
MA WORKED PLENTY HARD HERSELF.

42:35.512 --> 42:37.306
STILL DOES.

42:37.306 --> 42:40.392
SHE COOKS AND SEWS
AND CLEANS

42:40.392 --> 42:44.688
AND TAKES CARE OF
THE LOT OF US, PA INCLUDED.

42:44.688 --> 42:46.815
I REMEMBER ONCE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

42:46.815 --> 42:48.817
COMING DOWN WITH THE FEVER.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.987
MA SAT UP NEXT TO ME
ALL NIGHT LONG.

42:51.987 --> 42:55.449
I SLEPT SOME,
BUT SHE, NEVER.

42:55.449 --> 43:00.204
ANYTIME I'D OPEN MY EYES,
SHE'D BE THERE, SMILING,

43:00.204 --> 43:03.540
PUTTING A COLD CLOTH
TO MY HEAD.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.335
NOW WITH ME AND MARY
SPROUTING UP--

43:06.335 --> 43:08.254
WHICH IS WHAT MA
CALLS IT--

43:08.254 --> 43:11.215
IF THERE'S THE LEAST
LITTLEST NOISE IN THE NIGHT,

43:11.215 --> 43:14.677
MA WOULD COME CLIMBING
UP THE LADDER INTO THE LOFT

43:14.677 --> 43:17.179
TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

43:17.179 --> 43:20.099
I RECKON THERE'S TIMES
SHE GETS BONE-TIRED,

43:20.099 --> 43:22.393
BUT YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.

43:22.393 --> 43:24.603
HER SMILE'S
THE LAST THING I SEE

43:24.603 --> 43:27.273
BEFORE I CLOSE MY EYES
AT NIGHT

43:27.273 --> 43:31.068
AND THE FIRST THING
I WANT TO SEE IN THE MORNING.

43:31.068 --> 43:33.654
SHE'S BEEN SELLING EGGS
TO THE MERCANTILE

43:33.654 --> 43:38.075
AND SAVED ENOUGH TO BUY YARD GOODS
TO MAKE HERSELF A NEW DRESS.

43:38.075 --> 43:43.914
THIS MORNING, MARY AND ME FOUND OUT SHE
MADE DRESSES FOR THE TWO OF US INSTEAD.

43:43.914 --> 43:47.418
THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE LOVES US.

43:47.418 --> 43:50.337
THAT'S THE KIND
OF MOTHER MA IS,

43:50.337 --> 43:52.131
AND THAT'S WHY
WE LOVE HER SO MUCH.

43:53.882 --> 43:55.968
[APPLAUSE]

44:08.522 --> 44:10.607
[No AUDIO]

44:21.452 --> 44:23.370
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN,
MR. INGALLS.

44:23.370 --> 44:24.955
WELL, THANK YOU, MR. OLESON.

44:24.955 --> 44:26.040
GUESS THAT'S THE ONE THING
IN THIS LIFE

44:26.040 --> 44:27.708
I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE OF.

44:27.708 --> 44:28.834
Mrs. Oleson: NELS!

44:32.963 --> 44:34.757
VERY LUCKY.

44:34.757 --> 44:36.759
MA'AM.

44:36.759 --> 44:39.136
MA, PA, WHAT
DID YOU THINK?

44:39.136 --> 44:40.387
DID YOU LIKE
MY ESSAY?

44:40.387 --> 44:42.514
I THOUGHT IT WAS
LOVELY, MARY.

44:42.514 --> 44:43.849
YOU MADE ME OUT
TO BE A BIT OF A HERO,

44:43.849 --> 44:45.559
BUT I GUESS I CAN'T
FAULT YOU FOR THAT.

44:54.943 --> 44:56.028
LAURA.

44:57.488 --> 45:00.324
WHAT YOU SAID TODAY
WAS BEAUTIFUL,

45:00.324 --> 45:04.078
AND I'LL TREASURE IT
AS LONG AS I LIVE,

45:04.078 --> 45:05.871
BUT...

45:05.871 --> 45:08.791
IT WASN'T WHAT YOU HAD WRITTEN
DOWN ON THE PAPER, WAS IT?

45:11.168 --> 45:13.879
IT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE
WRITTEN IF I COULD.

45:13.879 --> 45:16.423
I KNOW THAT, DEAR,

45:16.423 --> 45:19.927
BUT IT WASN'T REALLY
AN ESSAY, WAS IT?

45:22.805 --> 45:23.889
NO, MA.

45:37.861 --> 45:41.698
I THINK I BETTER
GIVE IT TO MISS BEADLE.

45:41.698 --> 45:43.450
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL DO?

45:43.450 --> 45:44.660
THAT'S UP TO
MISS BEADLE.

46:18.026 --> 46:19.570
AH, MRS. INGALLS!

46:19.570 --> 46:22.781
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MUST BE
VERY PROUD OF YOUR GIRLS TODAY.

46:22.781 --> 46:23.824
WE ARE.

46:23.824 --> 46:25.367
AND YOU, YOUNG LADY,

46:25.367 --> 46:27.286
YOU GAVE ONE OF
THE FINEST RECITATIONS

46:27.286 --> 46:28.704
IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE
TO HEAR.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.043
LAURA WANTED YOU TO SEE
HER PAPER, MISS BEADLE.

46:36.587 --> 46:37.629
OH.

46:47.014 --> 46:49.349
YES.

46:49.349 --> 46:52.686
LAURA'S SPELLING
HAS IMPROVED A GREAT DEAL.

46:52.686 --> 46:55.939
HER PENMANSHIP
NEEDS A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT.

46:55.939 --> 46:58.275
BUT I THINK WITH
A LITTLE MORE HARD WORK,

46:58.275 --> 47:00.486
BY THE TIME
THE SCHOOL YEAR'S OUT,

47:00.486 --> 47:02.154
SHE'LL HAVE THAT
MASTERED AS WELL.

47:08.327 --> 47:09.703
THANK YOU,
MISS BEADLE.

47:36.021 --> 47:39.566
Laura, narrating: MA TOOK
MARY'S ESSAY AND MINE, Too.

47:39.566 --> 47:42.569
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO
PUT THEM IN THE SPECIAL BOX

47:42.569 --> 47:45.864
WHERE SHE KEPT THE SCHOOLBOOKS
AND HER WEDDING DRESS

47:45.864 --> 47:48.450
AND EVERYTHING
SHE LOVED MOST.

47:48.450 --> 47:51.662
MADE US PROUD SHE'D WANT 'EM
FOR REMEMBERING.

47:51.662 --> 47:53.914
BUT I KNEW,
EVEN WITHOUT THE PAPERS,

47:53.914 --> 47:57.334
THERE WASN'T ONE OF US
LIKELY TO FORGET THAT DAY.

47:57.334 --> 47:58.627
NOT EVER.
