00:03.962 --> 00:06.798
They about to see
a different side of Reina.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.090
Alright? I'm done
doing charity.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.719
This ain't
a 501(c)(3), bitch.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.888
Okay? I don't get paid
to help your broke ass.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.432
Tell 'em what
you just told
me, though.

00:15.473 --> 00:16.599
Uh, we were just
talkin' about

00:16.641 --> 00:18.560
all these fake hoes
in the industry.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.311
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because one thing about me.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.481
I lift as I climb.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.608
I don't subscribe to
that "crabs in a barrel"
mentality.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.902
-No. Ha. Ha!
-That's a R.

00:27.944 --> 00:28.987
You know what
that R is for?

00:28.987 --> 00:29.988
Huh?

00:30.488 --> 00:31.823
"Real," bitch.
That's for--

00:31.823 --> 00:32.656
And "ready."
Bitch.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.992
Real and ready, bitch.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.410
Real, ready, and Reign.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.162
Drip drop. Drip drop.
And you know what rain can do?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.164
Rain can flood.
Rain can storm.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.499
Rain can fuck you up
and drown your ass.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.625
-Fuck. (scoffs)
-(chuckles)

00:42.667 --> 00:44.085
They said,
"Say they names."

00:44.127 --> 00:47.255
They wish I would.
They really wish I would.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.007
Somebody said,
"Run the fade."

00:49.049 --> 00:50.175
Ah!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.975
-Run the fade then.
-Ha! Ha!

00:59.017 --> 01:01.811
I ain't runnin' nowhere, bitch.
I'm ten toes down.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.313
-Bitch.

dined with us before?

01:27.212 --> 01:28.380
No.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.049
But I'm sure the mimosas
hit different up here.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.384

01:32.884 --> 01:33.968

01:34.928 --> 01:37.722
-Shawna: Hey!
-Francois: Hi.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.557
-Hey, can we get some menus?
-We're good.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.143
Okay.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.064
(indistinct chatter)

01:51.695 --> 01:52.737
(sighs)

01:54.698 --> 01:56.324
Have I not
been good to y'all?

01:57.283 --> 01:59.953
Was I not transparent
about what this was
and wasn't going to be?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.917
Okay, look, we've given up
a lot to be here,

02:05.917 --> 02:07.794
and we just want something
to show for it.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.045
So performing in front
of thousands of people

02:10.088 --> 02:11.506
across the country
is what?

02:12.549 --> 02:13.675
Can I get
you ladies
a drink?

02:13.717 --> 02:14.759
-We're good.
-Shawna: Yeah. Can--

02:17.220 --> 02:18.555
Mia:
I mean...

02:18.596 --> 02:20.181
can we get some press?

02:20.223 --> 02:21.933
I mean, I know somebody
want to interview us.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.476
Yeah. What happened
to us recording an EP?

02:23.977 --> 02:27.605
See, I wanted to, like,
wait to tell y'all,

02:27.647 --> 02:30.775
but I got us a session
with Pardison Fontaine.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.360
The songwriter?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.445
-Francois: Yeah.
-You lyin'.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.529
Mm-hmm.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.947
-He wrote for Beyoncé.
-Yeah.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.824
And he wanna
work with us?

02:38.450 --> 02:41.036
Look, y'all can keep
doubting me if you want,

02:41.077 --> 02:42.871
or you can trust
that I'm dedicated.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.124
We got this Billboard party
tomorrow night,

02:46.124 --> 02:49.293
and the head of fuckin' Def Jam
is gonna be there.

02:49.293 --> 02:51.129
And he said he wants
to meet with y'all.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.922
Wait, you told Def Jam
about us?

02:52.964 --> 02:54.591
I could un-tell him
if you want me to.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.885
No, no, no. This is...

02:57.427 --> 03:01.639
Look, I know this shit
with Reina is a lot.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.642
I know. I see it.
You think I don't see it?

03:04.642 --> 03:07.645
I see it. But without Reina,
there is no tour.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.272
Without the tour,
y'all are not even

03:09.314 --> 03:11.483
on the label's radar
a little bit,

03:11.483 --> 03:13.485
so y'all got to suck it
the fuck up

03:13.485 --> 03:16.071
and apologize to Reina.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.531
Deal?

03:22.202 --> 03:23.828
Deal. (sighs) Fine.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.122
Okay. Alright.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.415
Bring in the food!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.002

you wasn't gon'

What?

-Mia: Oh, yeah?
-Shawna: Oh, shit.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.987
Man, you know we in LA,
I had to roll out

03:58.029 --> 04:00.115
the red carpet
for my artists.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.616
-Shawna: Come on!
-Mia: Yeah!

04:01.658 --> 04:03.118
Thank you so much,
Chastity.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.203
-This means so much.
-Oh!

04:05.203 --> 04:07.288
Chastity: Man, we in
motherfucking Hollywood!

04:07.330 --> 04:08.957
I want y'all to relax,

04:08.998 --> 04:11.376
pour some of that
good 1800 tequila,

04:11.376 --> 04:13.128
order room service,
hit the pool,

04:13.169 --> 04:14.629

How you get
Ace Hotel money?

04:21.720 --> 04:22.721
Some street shit?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.723
Do I count y'all pockets?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.224
(Shawna chuckles)

04:26.266 --> 04:28.393
Nah, nigga,
the real question is

04:28.435 --> 04:29.853
the fuck took y'all so long?

04:29.894 --> 04:31.312
I thought y'all was just
goin' to get something to eat.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.064
Child, Francois texts us
talkin' 'bout

04:33.064 --> 04:34.983
some "emergency meeting."

04:35.275 --> 04:37.068
Shawna: He wanted to talk
about the Reina situation.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.405
He's like,
(mockingly) "Y'all should
probably apologize to Reina."

04:40.405 --> 04:44.159
Apologize? For what?
(laughs)

04:44.200 --> 04:45.744
Nigga, why?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.165
Oh, y'all gonna do it?

04:50.206 --> 04:51.750
I mean,
he setting us up

04:51.750 --> 04:53.084
to record with a nigga
with a Grammy.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.544
Yeah. And he's
introducing us

04:54.586 --> 04:56.171
to the head of Def Jam.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.048
Man, if y'all having
label meetings and shit,

04:58.089 --> 04:59.883
I definitely should
have been there.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.718
And why the fuck this nigga
keep trying to make moves

05:01.760 --> 05:02.802
without my input?

05:03.762 --> 05:04.888
I thought
y'all was talking.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.181
Nah.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.768
But it's cool.
I'ma hit that nigga right now.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.437

05:36.419 --> 05:38.213
Hi. Oh, my God.
I'm glad you finally answered.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.465
I've been trying
to reach you.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.468
About your car's
extended warranty.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.136
What's up?

05:45.178 --> 05:48.139
I have been thinking
about you, and I miss you.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.600
Shawna, you don't
gotta do all this.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.643
All of what?

05:52.310 --> 05:54.896
Checking on me,
acting like you care.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.481
I'm not your nigga.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.149
I do care. I do.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.943
Look, what do you
want me to say to you?

05:59.943 --> 06:01.277
What do you want me to do?

06:01.653 --> 06:03.405
You not offering me
no solutions.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.115
I'm literally still
trying to figure out

06:05.156 --> 06:06.741
how we even got here.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.952
Maurice, I was not the only
one that needed money.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.662
You was so eager to help me.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.038
We got here together.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.208
And you was sending cards
to just me?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.586
What are you trying to say
to me right now?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.672
Is this just some shit
that Stanley said to you?

I don't give a damn
what you think about me,

but can't no conversations
be had with my artists

11:01.745 --> 11:02.829
and I'm not there.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.206
I'm the one that's been
helping them with their career,

11:05.248 --> 11:06.833
and I ain't going nowhere.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.793
So you gon' have to
show me some respect.

into perspective
for you really quick.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.611
Four: I'm getting them
a session with Pardi

11:34.652 --> 11:37.155
to make a song
that generates interest

11:37.155 --> 11:40.825
in the EP that I will
produce and arrange.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.244
That's me, me, me.
Yeah. Yeah.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.829
(laughs)

11:44.871 --> 11:47.457
So, what the fuck
are you asking me

11:47.499 --> 11:48.667
to respect you for?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.293
-I just feel like--
-I feel like

11:50.335 --> 11:51.628
a broken record
at this point,

11:51.670 --> 11:53.088
but they don't need you.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.632
And if this meeting
goes good,

11:55.674 --> 11:57.175
I'm gonna make sure
they know that.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.804
Or you could
stay in your lane

12:00.845 --> 12:02.639
and somehow
keep convincing them

12:02.681 --> 12:04.182
to let you along
for the ride.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.434
The choice is yours.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.354
So what do you want?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.405
Mia:
We know, um...

12:19.322 --> 12:21.533
that shit was kind of crazy
in Oakland or whatever.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.826
For sure.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.204
So, sorry if you felt
some kind of way.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.499
Yeah, 'cause feeling
some type of way sucks,
you know?

12:29.541 --> 12:31.543
And we don't want you
to feel like that.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.336
Mia:
Yeah, and I would
hate to feel a way

12:33.378 --> 12:36.047
-because you felt a way.
-Mm-hmm.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.465
-Mia: Right, Shawna?
-Shawna: Yeah. Yeah.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.135
No feelings,
just vibes.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.306
Is that all?

12:46.057 --> 12:47.225
Shawna:
Mm-hmm.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.561
-Uh, I'll be back. Oh.
-Shawna: Hmm?

12:49.561 --> 12:51.062
We done, right?

12:52.397 --> 12:53.231
(mouths)

12:54.566 --> 12:55.817
-Hey.
-Shawna: Hmm?

12:56.359 --> 12:58.153
I just want to know
what's your problem with me?

12:59.195 --> 13:01.448
What are you talking about?
We just apologized to you.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.908
Yeah. I don't feel
like you meant it.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.577
I haven't done
shit to you,

13:05.577 --> 13:07.412
but you keep
coming for me.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.496
Why?

13:10.206 --> 13:11.207
Reina,

13:11.249 --> 13:13.335
you lean on
lame-ass stereotypes

13:13.376 --> 13:14.711
so you can simulate Blackness

13:14.753 --> 13:16.212
and sell it back
to white people.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.381
That's what you do.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.591
You're not taking
a part of anything,

13:19.632 --> 13:20.592
you're bastardizing it.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.052
I am bastardizing no one.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.720
I claim all my sons.
(chuckles)

13:24.220 --> 13:27.432
Oh, my God. This is why
you piss me off so much.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.100
You know what
you're doing right now?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.894
If you hate this shit so much,

13:30.935 --> 13:33.104
why do you dance
next to me every night?

13:33.104 --> 13:33.980
(scoffs)

13:34.481 --> 13:35.440
It's weird.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.609
You doing
the exact same shit.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.614
I don't need you,
and I don't need
your stupid pop songs.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.115
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.367
-Oh, really? Bet.
-Shawna: Bet.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.576
I'ma make sure
Francois knows

13:46.618 --> 13:47.786
you said that.

13:47.786 --> 13:48.870
And one thing's for sure,

13:48.912 --> 13:50.121
I'm not taking
no more disrespect

-Okay.
-Believe that.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.974
That's dope.
Let me give you my contact.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.268
(sharp exhale)
Say less.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.147
-'Cause I was think--
-Is this me?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.860
Man, them phone--
phones be just listening.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.281
(hip-hop music
playing over speakers)

16:30.281 --> 16:31.908
Shawna:
Girl, there you are.
I've been lookin' for you.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.743
What's wrong?
You see Ca$h yet?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.829
No, no. No, no, no.
No, you're good. You're good.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.040
(sighs) But I definitely
fucked things up with Reina.

16:39.082 --> 16:39.958
(smacks lips)

16:40.000 --> 16:40.875
-Hey.
-Yeah. Yeah.

16:40.917 --> 16:41.793
Tunji is here.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.752
(Mia gasps)

16:42.794 --> 16:43.712
We should go talk to him.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.130
He's about to
make his rounds.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.048
-Wh-where Chastity?
-I'm right here.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.759
-(Shawna hums)
-Cool. Uh,

16:49.801 --> 16:51.720
okay, we're about
to talk to the money.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.721
-Okay.
-Okay?

16:52.762 --> 16:54.389
-Okay.
-Tunji's heard your music.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.099
You just gotta
sell yourself. Alright?

16:56.141 --> 16:58.560
I'll handle the rest.
Okay. Let's go.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.936
(Mia chuckles)

16:59.978 --> 17:00.979
Okay.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.734
Hey-yo, Tunji!

17:07.861 --> 17:09.445
-Yo, what's up?
-Hey. Yo. What's up, man?

17:09.487 --> 17:10.488
-Yo, how you been, man?
-You good?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.781
Good to see you.
I'm good, man.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.824
These are the girls
I was telling you about.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.657
Mia: Hi.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.909
This is Mia
and Shawna.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.661
Legends in the making.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.246
Tunji:
I love "Seduce and Scheme."

17:18.288 --> 17:19.789
And I'm Chastity.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.999
Yeah, I manage them.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.585
Chastity does
the day-to-day.

17:23.626 --> 17:24.961
Yeah. Everything
they've done so far

17:25.002 --> 17:26.463
has been really independent.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.630
No money behind 'em.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.174
They've been getting
this huge following

17:29.174 --> 17:30.342
from the Lord AK shows.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.177
So right now,
we're just, like,

17:32.177 --> 17:33.762
on the ground

17:33.803 --> 17:35.138
poppin' off
in these major markets.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.014
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.349
Oh, great to meet y'all.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.516
Tell me about yourselves.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.352
Well, I'm Mia.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.354
A real-ass bitch, you know?

17:42.354 --> 17:44.773
What these rap bitches
want to be, I am.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.024
-(Mia chuckles)
-Shawna: Yes. (clears throat)

17:46.024 --> 17:47.359
Mia had a following online

17:47.400 --> 17:48.985
even before
we started rapping.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.487
And she and our producer
make sure

17:50.528 --> 17:52.781
that we have
that authentic Miami sound.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.033
-Mia: Mm-hmm. Periodt.
And it's raw shit. Okay?
-Shawna: Yes.

17:55.075 --> 17:58.703
We some real bad bitches
that can rap for real.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.038
-You know?
-Yeah.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.623
Mia: Shawna,
she's like a mad genius.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.041
You know,
she write all our bars.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.543
Yeah.
When she's not gettin'
in trouble and shit.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.005
Yeah, yeah, I'm--
I have a reckless side.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.007
I'm-- I'm dangerous.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.301
(chuckles)
Wild! (growls)

18:13.343 --> 18:14.719
Mia:
She be going viral
on accident.

18:14.719 --> 18:15.762
(chuckles)

18:17.555 --> 18:19.432
Sounds good.
Let's keep talking.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.561
-Yeah.
-Great. You got
a business card?

18:23.561 --> 18:25.563
That way I can connect you.
I can hit him up.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.148
Francois,
come with me.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.525
Chastity:
He'll get a b-- I'ma, I--

18:28.566 --> 18:30.068
-I'ma get his contact.
-Did he like us?

18:30.068 --> 18:31.236
-Chastity: What?
-What are they talking about?

18:31.236 --> 18:32.320
Look at Megamind.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.488
Probably fucking
everything up.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.864
I should've went.
They for sure--

18:34.906 --> 18:36.241
Shawna:
Oh, he's walking away.
I don't know.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.367
Chastity:
I'ma head out there.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.410
-And I'm just--
-No. Chastity, no.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.577
-No.
-Alright.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.247
Here he come
with some bullshit, watch.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.542
Y'all fucking killed
that shit!

18:45.583 --> 18:47.168
-Mia: Yeah.
-What? (squeals)

18:47.210 --> 18:48.253
(in British accent)
Big fucking t'ings, bruv.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.087
Mia: Yes!

18:49.129 --> 18:50.338
Big fucking t'ings.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.257
-Really? It ain't look like it.
-It's mental.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.550
Yes.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.343
He said he wants y'all
to come to the office

18:55.385 --> 18:57.262
-after the tour!
-No way. No.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.513
-Francois: Yes.
-Don't play with us.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.973
-Periodt.
-Yo, we got to celebrate.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.767
Yes. I ain't gonna be
at the strip club office,

19:02.767 --> 19:04.185
I'm gonna be
at his office.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.354
-(Shawna sniffs)
-Hey, I'ma go get a drink.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.357
Oh, my God. What?

19:09.399 --> 19:12.110
Alright, so I didn't want to say
anything in front of Chastity,

19:12.152 --> 19:14.988
but he did say something
about Chastity.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.492
Who speaks for you
says everything.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.746
I think, uh, it's not
important right now

19:22.787 --> 19:24.664
but it's definitely
something to consider.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.336
-(Shawna coughs)
-Francois: Maybe later.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.962
Shawna:
Definitely later.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.298
Girl, when you
started smoking?

19:33.298 --> 19:35.633
Since we started talking
to people like Tunji.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.677
-What?
-(both laugh)

19:38.803 --> 19:41.431
-Girl, let me think
of something I'ma buy.
-(Shawna coughs, bleats)

19:41.473 --> 19:43.808
-(spits, bleats)
-You okay?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.143
(Shawna clears throat)

19:48.646 --> 19:51.232
-Ca$h. (chuckles)
-Hey. What's up, baby?

19:51.274 --> 19:53.818
-Mia: Hey.
-You, you look good as shit.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.863
(people chattering)

19:57.989 --> 19:59.157
Thank you.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.825
Ca$h:
Man, that shit
fit like a glove.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.160
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.954
Thank you.
I love the dress.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.414
I appreciate you so much.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.624
Absolutely.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.250
And you know I got
a little extra for you.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.002
Mia: Hoo! (chuckles)
Get a little extra.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.254
Yeah. Nah, I know
that you like to show off.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.590
Show off. That's me.
(giggles)

20:15.632 --> 20:17.342
Man, you know,
I don't smoke no more.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.511
I told you, you got
to do shrooms, dawg.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.179
-Just microdose.
-Yeah.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.972
-Yeah.
-Man: Alright.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.350
-Woman: Yeah.
-(group laughing)

20:25.392 --> 20:26.601
You done it before?

20:27.644 --> 20:28.770
I'm on one right now.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.195
(coughs) Shit.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.363
(Lord AK laughs)

20:39.239 --> 20:40.573
What's the occasion?

20:41.241 --> 20:44.869
Just sold myself
to a record label.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.539
Don't sell all of you.
Might not get it back.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.292
-My bad. (laughs)
-Oh, shit.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.293
Okay.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.046
Scary ass.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.589
That's fire, though.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.508
-How do you feel?
-(sighs)

20:58.550 --> 20:59.968
I'm excited. I just...

21:01.720 --> 21:03.555
I can't, like, access
the outward expression

21:03.555 --> 21:04.723
of it right now.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.183
(heavy sigh)

21:07.225 --> 21:08.560
I went off on Reina.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.479
I just said fuck it,
honestly.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.731
I don't know what's
gonna happen now

21:12.731 --> 21:14.315
but I do know
that I cannot handle

21:14.357 --> 21:15.734
her fake shit anymore.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.112
You did what a lot
of people can't do.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.701
This industry's
all about the spectacle.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.912
It's gettin' harder
for me to feel anything.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.667
I'm like fuckin'
One-Punch Man.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.502
Wait, wait, wait.
You fuck with
One-Punch Man?

21:35.378 --> 21:37.255
-Yeah.
-Say word.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.341
Every night,
I watch Saitama
kill all those monsters

21:39.382 --> 21:42.427
with one punch
and never feel shit.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.553
Never.

21:43.595 --> 21:44.679
Always looking
for the thrill

21:44.721 --> 21:45.764
of a real opponent.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.933
Yeah, that's my nigga.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.103
I had no idea
you were an anime nerd.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.522
