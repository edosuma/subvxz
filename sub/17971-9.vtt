Ow, bitch!
What the hell?!

01:26.720 --> 01:28.787
I pick the tree for this family.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.189
You know, since
Robert left,

01:30.191 --> 01:32.458
I have been letting
Rallo pick the tree.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.126
All right, then pick one.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.427
I got one right here.

This tree is wrong!

01:53.848 --> 01:55.314
We're getting the one I want.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.583
Man, you don't know
nothing about Christmas.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.085
My real dad knew
how to pick out a tree.

02:00.087 --> 02:04.456
Too bad he's busy off busting
mafia punks for the FBI.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.325
FBI? What kind of horse...

02:06.327 --> 02:08.460
Yeah, Robert's off
working for the FBI.

02:12.333 --> 02:16.635
What is it with your family
and kicking people?!

02:19.572 --> 02:21.206
How can you
let Rallo believe

02:21.208 --> 02:22.674
that Robert is
an FBI agent?

02:22.676 --> 02:26.745
Maybe if it stood for
"Freeloading, Boozing Idiot."

02:26.747 --> 02:27.446
(laughs)

02:27.448 --> 02:29.715
Hey, that was right off
the top of my head.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.450
Suck on that, Wayne Brady.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.784
Look, Rallo kept
asking him

02:32.786 --> 02:34.052
why he never
came to visit.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.921
Next thing I know,
Robert's telling him

02:35.923 --> 02:38.757
he's an undercover agent,
so I just went with it.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.925
You lied to your child?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.760
It's like my great-grandmother
used to say,

02:41.762 --> 02:45.230
"A lie is just
an upside down truth."

02:45.232 --> 02:45.764
What?!

02:45.766 --> 02:48.734
(thinking):
<i>Hmm, can I trust Donna?</i>

02:48.736 --> 02:50.002
Look, I'll tell
him the truth

02:50.004 --> 02:51.703
when he's older and
can handle it better.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.473
I guess sometimes lying
is the right thing to do.

02:54.475 --> 02:58.777
Like the time I ran
into that guy from <i>Entourage.</i>

02:59.779 --> 03:02.814
Hey, you're
Adrian Gr... (mumbles)

03:02.816 --> 03:04.349
from <i>Entourage.</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:05.083
Yes, I am.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.286
Yeah, you're
totally believable

03:07.288 --> 03:08.754
as a big movie star,

03:08.756 --> 03:10.556
with your weird
pot belly,

03:10.558 --> 03:13.392
spindly arms
and huge head.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.662
Your body is gross.

Wow!

03:20.267 --> 03:23.902
Your boss goes all out
for the office Christmas party.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.571
Why does
Mr. Waterman have

03:25.573 --> 03:27.472
shirtless men
walking all around?

03:27.474 --> 03:28.907
Well, Rallo, when
you're older,

03:28.909 --> 03:30.375
there are
things that...

03:30.377 --> 03:31.777
Oh, is he a gay?

03:31.779 --> 03:32.744
Yes, he is a gay.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.713
Well, he knows
how to do Christmas

03:34.715 --> 03:36.782
better than you,
Plump Chump.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.416
(growls)

03:37.418 --> 03:40.485
I'm gonna need this
and plenty more.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.923

I'm joking, of course.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.263

04:48.088 --> 04:49.554
What?!
Yeah.

04:49.556 --> 04:50.689
Don't know the details.

Apparently, he had
raped a bunch of folks.

Yup.

that you could put
on the Santa suit

So, what, he keeps it
tied up somewhere,

05:53.687 --> 05:56.288
just to bring it out
on Christmas as a prop?

05:56.290 --> 06:00.392
Yes. I can't imagine
how that feels.

Now, I want you
to understand

06:24.451 --> 06:27.953
that most of the stuff

06:27.955 --> 06:29.187
than out-and-out
naughtiness.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.390
Well, what would you

Good to know

06:34.962 --> 06:37.129
I can count on somebody
this Christmas,

06:37.131 --> 06:38.830
not like my
lame-ass step-dad.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.934
Oh, I'm sure your step-dad
is doing the best he can.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.236
Santa, you're
being kind,

06:44.238 --> 06:46.204
and that's who you are,
and I love that.

06:46.206 --> 06:50.208
But no, Cleveland just
plain sucks at Christmas.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.110

06:52.112 --> 06:56.481
Hey, Prancer, park that
tray of drinks right here.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.917
Attention, people of YouTube.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.153
Today, I am setting
a reindeer free,

07:01.155 --> 07:04.556
a courageous act which may
end up being seen by Tyra Banks,

07:04.558 --> 07:06.458
who will then call me
and ask me to become

07:06.460 --> 07:10.562
the Gayle to her Oprah, but
without the sexual obligations.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.697
Okay, I think
I got him untied.

07:12.699 --> 07:18.103
Mr. Reindeer,
I now give you your freed...

07:18.105 --> 07:19.304
Aah, the hooves!

07:19.306 --> 07:20.338
Or is it "huves"?

07:20.340 --> 07:23.508
Either way, this hurts like
a "myoother fyooquer."

07:23.510 --> 07:24.943
(grunts)

07:24.945 --> 07:26.378
Bye!

07:27.146 --> 07:28.480
Ah, and this fool is like,

07:28.482 --> 07:30.348
(mimics Cleveland):
"Gee, Donna, do you think

07:30.350 --> 07:32.484
this tinsel is
a fire hazard?"

07:32.486 --> 07:35.287
I'm sure that sounds
nothing like him.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.456
Meanwhile,
my real dad is out there

07:37.458 --> 07:39.558
putting his life on the line
for justice.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.962
And you should see what my bozo
step-dad calls a mustache.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.030
Aw, hell no!

07:45.032 --> 07:46.164
His mustache is cool!

07:46.166 --> 07:48.433
And your dad is not
an undercover agent!

07:48.435 --> 07:52.103
Your dad is nothing
but a no-good deadbeat loser

07:52.105 --> 07:56.074
who "freelances"
at a car wash!
- What?!

07:56.076 --> 07:58.443
Your dad's a bum!

08:01.914 --> 08:04.316
How am I gonna get out
of this one?

08:04.318 --> 08:09.120
Find out after these loud
and off-putting messages.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.228
Was Santa right
about Daddy?

08:16.230 --> 08:18.830
That he lied about
being an FBI agent

08:18.832 --> 08:22.200
and going undercover
as a dog to bust Michael Vick?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.168
(slurred):
I should've--

08:23.170 --> 08:26.638
Santa should've kept
his mouth shut.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.940
(belches)

08:30.209 --> 08:33.445
That will not
smell good.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.750
(sighs) I'm afraid your
dad was lying, honey.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.619
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

08:40.621 --> 08:44.556
What about all these letters
Dad sent from Russia?

08:44.558 --> 08:46.324
I sent those.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.793
What about his badge?

08:48.795 --> 08:52.931
It's a promotional item
from <i>Paul Blart: Mall Cop.</i>

08:52.933 --> 08:55.367
What about his FBI MVP trophy?

08:55.369 --> 08:59.371
Yeah, you can just get trophies
made for anything.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.539
(squeaking)

09:00.541 --> 09:01.706
You mean...?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.708
(groans)

09:03.710 --> 09:05.143
Hmm, I'm gonna keep it.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.113
I can't believe
you've been lying to me.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.381
I'm so sorry, baby.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.952
Just know that your
family loves you very much.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.487

09:51.757 --> 09:54.492
Thank you,
Wally and the Fluffers.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.328
That was glorious.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.496
And now, the child
who was selected

09:58.498 --> 10:01.166
from the entire student body
to read his letter

10:01.168 --> 10:05.337
to Santa "Chhhlaus" that
just might help remind us all

10:05.339 --> 10:08.840
what "Chhhhhhhristmas"
is really about,

10:08.842 --> 10:12.777
an adorable little "goy,"
Rallo Tubbs.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.147
(ancient tune plays)

10:18.150 --> 10:20.585
(feedback squeals softly)

10:20.587 --> 10:22.354
(clears throat)

10:22.356 --> 10:25.190
"Dear Santa, (bleep) you,

10:25.192 --> 10:27.392
and (bleep) Christmas."

10:30.363 --> 10:32.631
That's what happens
when you put a Jew

10:32.633 --> 10:35.300
in charge
of a Christmas pageant.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.240
This is all
your fault.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.341
You <i>hads</i> to
go get drunk

10:43.343 --> 10:44.876
and tell him the truth
about his dad.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.079
Yeah? Well, you been lying
to him for years.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.047
And it was working!

10:49.049 --> 10:51.349
At least we don't
have to lie to him anymore,

10:51.351 --> 10:53.251
'cause I'm done
making phone calls

10:53.253 --> 10:55.053
(Robert's voice):
talkin' like this.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.254
"Happy Birthday, Rallo.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.556
How's your mama's
ass look?"

10:58.558 --> 10:59.391
You know what?

10:59.393 --> 11:01.626
This is my fault,
and I'll fix it.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.529
I'll get Rallo back
into the Christmas spirit.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.497
Thanks, Cleveland.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.500
(Robert's voice):
Good lookin' out, doughboy.

11:10.636 --> 11:11.836
Hey, look, Rallo!

11:11.838 --> 11:15.540
It's Stoolbend's largest
model train exhibit.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.708
Mm-hmm.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.209
Look how festive.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.744
It's not nearly
as depressing

11:19.746 --> 11:21.546
as the real
railroad industry.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.581
They say it's
cheaper than flying,

11:23.583 --> 11:25.350
but that's only true
if you think

11:25.352 --> 11:28.253
your time's worth nothing.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.089
Santa's driving the train?!

11:32.591 --> 11:35.160
You're a waste
of a life, fat man.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.327
Time to end it all.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.630
(train whistle blowing)

11:44.837 --> 11:46.705
(sirens wail, tires screech,
people screaming)

11:46.707 --> 11:48.840
REPORTER:
Blood on the tracks
today in Holidaytown,

11:48.842 --> 11:51.810
where for 68 passengers,
a routine train ride

11:51.812 --> 11:54.512
to Gum Drop Village
instead took a detour

11:54.514 --> 11:56.281
to the Gum Drop County Morgue.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.916
And now, over to Dirk
with sports.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.752
Hey, better make that
two massacres today.

12:00.754 --> 12:04.389
The Holidaytown Celebrators were
shut out eight to nothin'.

12:04.391 --> 12:09.394
A bad day indeed for pretend,
cake-figurine baseball.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.296
(screaming)

12:11.298 --> 12:12.197
(huffs)

12:12.199 --> 12:13.531
Merry Christmas, Cleveland.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.633
I was your secret Santa.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.236
Oh, pens.
Yeah.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.872
I saw you writing with
a pen that one time,

12:20.874 --> 12:23.174
so I know
you like 'em.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.442
I do like pens!

12:24.444 --> 12:25.677
See? He likes pens.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.712
No, I know.
No, I know he likes pens.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.281
I, I just thought it
would look cheap.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.483
And-and it does.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.383
Your opinion.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.352
Well, I guess
it's my turn.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.820
Here you go, Holt.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.857
A can of 25-year-old
Red Bull Private Reserve?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.593
Just like
Brody Jenner drinks!

12:41.595 --> 12:42.560
My whole life,

12:42.562 --> 12:46.231
Christmas was always about
Holt not being good enough.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.866
You give me wings, bro!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.167
(cries)

12:49.169 --> 12:50.468
You give me wings!

12:50.470 --> 12:51.503
(sobbing)

12:51.505 --> 12:53.004
A'ight, then.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.073
Daddy issues,
party of one.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.708
Yeah, well, speaking
of daddy issues,

12:56.710 --> 12:59.844
I still don't know what
I'm going to do about Rallo.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.813
Maybe if we get him
a big enough gift...

13:01.815 --> 13:03.815
Look, Cleveland,
it seems pretty clear

13:03.817 --> 13:07.986
that Rallo feels hurt, and he's
just displacing his anger

13:07.988 --> 13:09.621
onto Santa and Christmas.

13:09.623 --> 13:14.192
The only gift he could possibly
want would be to see his father.

13:14.194 --> 13:18.530
The most human among us
is a bear.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.132
Let that sink in.

13:22.935 --> 13:26.704
(throaty whisper):
I got to go find
Rallo's dad.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.706
Merry Christmas.

13:33.546 --> 13:38.216
Cleveland Jr., you're very
lucky to have a father.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.819
You know, not all boys
have fathers.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.788
Tonight I'm going to do
my best to make sure

13:43.790 --> 13:46.591
that Rallo has a father
on Christmas.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.693
But it's gonna be
a dangerous mission,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.428
and I might not make it back.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.430
No, Daddy, don't go!

13:52.432 --> 13:54.966
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.435
You've been
a good boy this year.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.670
I try, Daddy.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.938
Proud of you.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.675
And I bet Santa's gonna
bring you some nice gifts.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.276
I hope so.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.211
Mm-hmm.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.647
I'm so lucky to have
a son like you.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.481
So peaceful.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.784
You're creeping me
out a little, Dad.

14:12.786 --> 14:13.885
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:13.887 --> 14:17.956
Seems like just yesterday you
were standing up in your crib,

14:17.958 --> 14:20.258
shaking on the sides
like you couldn't wait

14:20.260 --> 14:23.695
to bust out of there
and explore the world.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.697
Now look at you.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.497
All fat.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.834
Can't play baseball
worth a pile of dog crap.

14:29.836 --> 14:33.238
Still writing letters
to Santa Claus at 14.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.808
Layin' back, taking it while
your dad strokes your face.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.443
What's wrong with you?!

14:38.445 --> 14:40.712
What kind of kid
have I raised?!

14:40.714 --> 14:41.613
Okay.

14:41.615 --> 14:45.683
Now I'm gonna go find
Rallo and Roberta's dad.

14:45.685 --> 14:46.751
(car alarm chirps)

14:46.753 --> 14:49.787
You are not going out
at midnight on Christmas Eve.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.656
Try and stop me.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.358
(Taser crackling)

14:53.360 --> 14:54.959
(farting)

14:54.961 --> 14:56.995
(sustained fart)

14:56.997 --> 14:58.563
Ah.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.736
Cleveland, nobody's been able
to track Robert down for months.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.905
Why don't you just
be a normal step-dad,

15:06.907 --> 15:08.606
buy his love and move on?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.875
No, I'm gonna give Rallo
the only present

15:10.877 --> 15:14.078
that's going to restore
his faith in Christmas:

15:14.080 --> 15:15.713
his father.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.482
What the hell?!

15:18.317 --> 15:20.585
(erotic moans)
(panting)

15:26.926 --> 15:29.861

16:30.957 --> 16:32.523
Everybody decent?

16:32.525 --> 16:33.224
Doughboy?!

16:33.226 --> 16:35.927
What the El DeBarge
are you doin' here?

16:35.929 --> 16:37.862
I need to talk to you
about your son.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.766
Ma'am, I think I saw
the Atlanta Hawks out there.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.135
Look, Rallo knows
you've been lying to him

16:44.137 --> 16:49.073
about being an FBI agent, and
it's ruined Christmas for him.

16:49.075 --> 16:49.640
So?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.042
The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson,

16:51.044 --> 16:53.745
his dad made him take a crockie
in a cardboard box

16:53.747 --> 16:57.715
under the Christmas tree
in front of the entire family.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.783
Is that true?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.351
That's what I heard.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.619
What the hell?

17:01.621 --> 17:05.823
Well, if so, Brian Wilson
defecated in that cardboard box

17:05.825 --> 17:07.859
because he loved his father,

17:07.861 --> 17:10.194
just like all boys
love their fathers!

17:10.196 --> 17:12.430
No matter how bad
they treat them.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.432
So I'm gonna dress up
like Santa

17:14.434 --> 17:17.468
and bring you to our house
as my gift to Rallo.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.605
And if you won't do it,
you're not worth the box

17:20.607 --> 17:24.075
Brian Wilson dropped
a little deuce coupe in.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.643
Get your hands off me.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.046
Look, Robert, this Christmas,

17:28.048 --> 17:30.848
the best present
you can give Rallo

17:30.850 --> 17:31.949
is just being present.

17:31.951 --> 17:36.354
Don't you hang your
homonyms on me, doughboy.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.257
I thought what you
said was beautiful.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.558
Thank you.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.760
Merry Christmas, whore.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.033
Merry Christmas, Rallo.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.568
Oh, is that
today?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.269
Here, baby.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.471
Look what's
under the tree.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.640
Ha. A slinky.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.841
What's wrong?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.009
I remember
the old Rallo

17:58.011 --> 18:01.112
who used to think a toy
could fix anything.

18:01.114 --> 18:05.216
That child's a
stranger to me now.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.284
Ho-ho-ho.

18:06.286 --> 18:10.655
Well, Santa, you got some
gigantic jingle bells

18:10.657 --> 18:13.558
showing your face around here.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.559
Santa!

18:14.561 --> 18:16.828
You're 14 years old.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.664
Rallo, Santa wanted
to apologize

18:19.666 --> 18:22.066
for what he said at
Mr. Waterman's party.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.701
So he went out
and got you

18:23.703 --> 18:26.070
the Christmas tree
you really wanted.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.072
He brought you a picture
of the guy

18:28.074 --> 18:30.842
who played Grady
on <i>Sanford and Son.</i>

18:30.844 --> 18:33.678
Whitman Mayo!
Yes! I needed him.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.046
Thanks, Santa Claus.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.547
(flames whooshing)

18:38.784 --> 18:39.951
Aw...

18:39.953 --> 18:42.019
ROBERT: Ho, ho, ho!

18:42.021 --> 18:43.688
Merry Christmas, peoples.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.789
What the...?!
What the...?!

18:44.791 --> 18:45.857
Oh, my word!

18:45.859 --> 18:48.626
Some type of warlock
has cursed Christmas!

18:48.628 --> 18:50.161
What's goin' on around here?

18:50.163 --> 18:52.730
Maybe this will
clear things up.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.431
Dad!

18:53.433 --> 18:55.166
How you doin',
Rolo?

18:55.168 --> 18:57.301
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.769
Last night,
I realized

18:58.771 --> 19:02.773
it's important for me to
see my sperms on Christmas.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.875
What's up, Rwanda?

19:03.877 --> 19:05.676
(listlessly):
Merry Christmas, Dad.

19:05.678 --> 19:09.680
A wise man told me,
the best gift

19:09.682 --> 19:10.815
is just being here.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.550
Kind of butchered it,
but whatever.

19:12.552 --> 19:16.988
Look, Rocco, I'm sorry I lied
about being an FBI agent.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.557
It was a lowdown, dirty move.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.059
Wow, you actually got
through to him.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.060
Course I did.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.695
It's my damn show.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.230
But why, Dad?

19:26.232 --> 19:28.266
Why would you lie
to your own kid?

19:28.268 --> 19:31.002
I guess I didn't want you
to know the truth about me.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.604
But now it's time
I told you everything.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.239
No more lies.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.611
The truth is...

19:40.613 --> 19:42.547
I am...

19:42.549 --> 19:43.781
Santa Claus.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.716
What?! You're
Santa Claus?!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.185
ALL:
You're Santa Claus?

19:47.187 --> 19:49.086
See, I live at
the North Pole,

19:49.088 --> 19:51.289
so that's why I can't
visit that much.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.991
Oh, that's why
you guys lied.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.895
So I wouldn't know
Santa's true identity.

19:57.897 --> 19:58.663
Exactly.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.832
And so your mama can't
garnish Santa's wages.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.668
But we gotta keep
this a secret.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.835
Just between us.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.971
But wait, if you're
Santa Claus,

20:06.973 --> 20:08.773
then who's this clown?

20:08.775 --> 20:10.074
Cleveland?!

20:10.076 --> 20:11.475
Oh, well, that's about right.

20:11.477 --> 20:15.046
Sorry-ass wannabe trying
to be as cool as my dad.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.147
Dad, there you are.

20:16.149 --> 20:20.151
Did you know that Rallo and
Roberta's dad is Santa Claus?

20:20.153 --> 20:21.752
(growls)

20:21.754 --> 20:23.120
(sighs)

20:23.122 --> 20:25.256
You're a good boy.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.091
Merry Christmas.

20:27.093 --> 20:27.925
(cooing)

20:27.927 --> 20:31.028
So, this all makes sense
to you, Rallo?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.129
Hell, yeah!

20:32.131 --> 20:34.565
My dad's Santa Claus!

20:37.202 --> 20:41.072
♪ Oh, the weather
outside is frightful ♪

20:41.074 --> 20:44.909
♪ But the fire is
so delightful ♪

20:44.911 --> 20:48.012
ALL:
♪ And since we've
no place to go ♪

20:48.014 --> 20:52.316
♪ Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow. ♪

20:52.318 --> 20:53.284
Ho-ho!

20:53.286 --> 20:56.988
A black Santa Claus.
(grunts)

20:56.990 --> 21:03.594
(sleigh bells ringing)
(pained):
Ho-ho-ho-ho...
