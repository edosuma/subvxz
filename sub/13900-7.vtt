the friggin' horn.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.880
I'm not barmping at you.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.220
I'm barmping at that.

00:13.260 --> 00:13.470
Way to keep a low profile.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.350
You think you could find a
bigger camera, or what?

00:17.140 --> 00:17.680
No. I couldn't, actually.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.020
We all just want a safe
working environment, Jake.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.310
It's ironic.

00:23.350 --> 00:25.810
Seeing how you usually make ours
a lot more dangerous.

00:25.850 --> 00:28.360
It's not my fault that
I often find myself

00:28.400 --> 00:31.490
in volatile situation that just
I happen to be ill prepared for.

00:31.530 --> 00:34.950

I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.370
That right there. That's a
grievable statement.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.550
Maybe he'll let you join

00:52.590 --> 00:54.470
You know, his men
seem to really love him.

00:54.510 --> 00:54.840
And respect him.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.590
And that's a very
important leadership skill.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.600
He inspires loyalty
amongst the troops.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.720

We do what we were hired to do.

a bunch of weapons.

it is a container I.D.

07:51.510 --> 07:54.180

Global's logistic software.

07:54.220 --> 07:57.310
And it looks like the
container is gone.

07:57.350 --> 07:59.810
Or lost in the manifest.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.230
How does a container
just disappear?

08:02.270 --> 08:03.850

tampering with the software.

I am. Oh wait.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.020
I found the container.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.030
It's in the yard, but whoever's
hiding it -

08:10.070 --> 08:11.280
They did a pretty good job.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.700
Find out who and hurry please.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.450
Okay. Maybe if I do a search-

08:15.490 --> 08:17.200
of the history of
every one of

08:17.240 --> 08:18.950
SeaWay Global's
authorized users.

08:18.990 --> 08:19.200
Can you do that?

08:20.330 --> 08:21.620
Without a lead?
It could take days.

08:21.660 --> 08:21.960
We don't have days, Des.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.210
Look. We're gonna need another
way to find that container.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.090
So, figure it out.

08:27.710 --> 08:29.800
That the minivan that crossed
the picket line this morning?

08:29.840 --> 08:30.050
Your photo got us a plate.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.930
The minivan is registered to
SeaWay Global Shipping.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.180
It's a corporate vehicle?

08:35.220 --> 08:35.550
Yeah, but nobody signed it out.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.430
They didn't even know it was
gone until I phoned them.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.430
I got a call from Tinny earlier.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.730
She said that the cops got
a few complaints

08:42.770 --> 08:44.350
about a green minivan driving
erratically

08:44.390 --> 08:45.980
in a neighborhood
not far from the port.

08:46.020 --> 08:46.360
Anybody I. D. the driver?

08:47.650 --> 08:49.730
Male. Early thirties. Medium
height and build.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.900
That narrows it down to about
half the men in the city.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.570
Let's go check out that
neighborhood.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.120
Come here, you tool.

09:01.910 --> 09:02.710
This is it.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.960
Somebody already broke in.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.000
The guns are gone.
We missed it Jake. It's over.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.590
The guns are gone. I'm ruined.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.130
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.220
Didn't your informant
say that the

09:16.260 --> 09:18.390
shipment of guns was due
tomorrow, right?

09:21.890 --> 09:24.350
Maybe we were led to these
phones as a clue.

09:24.390 --> 09:27.940
Phones? Nobody cares
about burner phones.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.690
This is about guns.
Guns are not phones.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.190
Somebody has the power

09:32.230 --> 09:33.070
to remove a shipment from
the manifest.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.570
So maybe whoever stole these
phones is the gun dealer.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.780
We could have been led to this
container for a reason.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.040
Okay, that makes sense.

09:42.080 --> 09:42.950
For now.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.710
Hey.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.000
You two can't be back here.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.460
Yeah, I'm working dock,
security.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
You're a long ways
from the picket line, pal.

09:50.540 --> 09:50.750
Yeah, fair enough.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.760
Most of the phones that were in
this container have been stolen.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.510
Shit. I do my best to
stay on top of that.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.760
Can't be everywhere at once.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.100
How'd you know that, anyway?

10:01.310 --> 10:02.100
Any chance you played bingo
last night?

10:02.970 --> 10:03.890
You play bingo? Table nine.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.020
Bingo. Do you play it?

10:05.060 --> 10:05.980
Is he okay?

10:06.020 --> 10:07.100
Not in any sense, no.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.320
If you're trying to reach out,
we can protect you.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.860
If you whistle blow.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.650
Are you whistle blowing?
You can whistle blow.

10:14.690 --> 10:14.990
It's okay.

10:16.570 --> 10:18.570
If you don't get the hell off
a my yard, you'll be sorry.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.740
Okay. But if I find out you're
a part of this,

10:21.780 --> 10:22.740
we're gonna nail you.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.660
Trust me.

10:26.580 --> 10:27.960
He came looking for
these phones.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.460
Do you think he's in on it?

10:29.500 --> 10:29.710
I don't know.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.750
He seemed pretty pissed that
the phones were stolen.

10:32.790 --> 10:35.050
Alright, we'll leave
Frank out of this for now.

10:35.090 --> 10:36.670
Go at it from another angle.

10:36.710 --> 10:39.630
Another angle. Like following up
on stolen phones.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.260
Yeah.
Who do you like in this town

10:41.300 --> 10:43.180
when it comes to
fencing stolen burners.

10:43.220 --> 10:47.560
I got a guy. But when you meet
him, be cool. Alright?

10:48.770 --> 10:50.850
He and me, we got a bit
of a history.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.690
Well, history is meant
to be broken.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.030
Let's go meet this man.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.700
You sure this was the
neighborhood

10:58.740 --> 11:00.200
where the green
minivan was spotted?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.280
Yes, I'm positive.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.660
Very positive.

11:06.870 --> 11:07.790
Matches the plate.

11:07.830 --> 11:08.660
Any damage?

11:09.080 --> 11:10.460
Dunno.

11:12.420 --> 11:13.880
We're gonna need to report
this to the police.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.880
- Blood?
- Dried. On the handle.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.550
And I can see some on the
steering wheel.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.430
What does this mean?

11:21.340 --> 11:21.640
That whoever we're looking for

11:22.850 --> 11:24.260
could be mixed up in
something dangerous.

11:27.060 --> 11:27.310
The Tely Ten.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.680
That's from the road race they
do every summer.

11:29.730 --> 11:29.940
I tried to run it last year.

11:31.440 --> 11:31.730
But Jake hauled me out halfway
through to work a case.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.400
That number should link to
the name of a runner.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.820
Maybe it fell off
our driver's shoe.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.030
I'll call the race organizers.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.240
[Rose] Pam Daniels.

11:42.280 --> 11:42.570
She's nineteen.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.160
Can't believe
Sloan has an older sister.

11:45.200 --> 11:45.410
Half sister.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.200
She didn't want me to know
that they were related.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.210
Hang up.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.460
And Jake, this Pam has
a criminal record.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.090
Three counts of identity theft.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.250
Oh man.

11:57.300 --> 11:57.920
Get off the phone.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.380
Keep me posted. I gotta go.
I'm gonna kill you.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.760
Why am I not surprised that your
kid is a degenerate?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.680
If you're trying to get
me to stick your nose

12:05.720 --> 12:07.510
straight up your arse,
then keep it up.

12:07.560 --> 12:07.810
Who is this Saul guy?

12:09.060 --> 12:10.600
Mind your own business
and follow my lead.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.230
If we can tie Saul to the
phones,

12:12.270 --> 12:13.980
then we know
we're on to something.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.520
But I got a feeling he's not
gonna admit

12:15.560 --> 12:16.820
to doing
anything wrong.

12:23.490 --> 12:24.820
Surprised to see you, Jake.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.030
Pleasantly surprised.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.830
It's nice to see you too.

12:28.870 --> 12:29.120
What happened?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.580
You miss running
jobs for me and Saul?

12:31.620 --> 12:31.910
[Jimmy]
What do you mean, jobs?

12:33.540 --> 12:35.630
Are you saying he was involved
in criminal activity with you?

12:37.130 --> 12:38.130
We need to see him.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.130
He's aware.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.050
Whatever you're doing-

12:42.090 --> 12:43.760
I better be happy with
the result.

12:45.970 --> 12:47.220
Just let me do the talking.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.510
So shut up.

12:49.260 --> 12:49.520
Saul.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.480
So you think you can just show
up any time you want, huh?

12:54.640 --> 12:56.980
Listen, this is my-

12:57.020 --> 12:57.940
Client.

12:57.980 --> 12:58.230
Yeah, my client.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.320
He's looking for a missing
shipment of cell phones.

13:01.360 --> 13:01.690
And we thought -

13:03.200 --> 13:05.570
Maybe you might have a line on
where we could find them.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.870
Cell phones disappear,
Jake.

13:06.910 --> 13:08.370
What do you want
me to do about it?

13:08.410 --> 13:10.080
I'm prepared to buy
them back from you.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.910
Assuming, that is,
you have them.

13:11.950 --> 13:13.660
Which we freaking
well know you do.

13:14.830 --> 13:16.380
You know, I know every
importer in town.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.840
And your red headed puissant
friend is not one of them.

13:22.170 --> 13:25.380
So whatever you're playing at,
Jake. Be careful.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.810
Risky.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.560
Bringing a cop to see Saul?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.180
What gave me away?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.730
I'm pretty cop-rugged, huh?
Yeah, I know.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.360
it's like It's hard to believe
I could be anything but the law.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.320
I get what you're saying.
When I was eleven -

13:41.360 --> 13:42.480
Okay -

13:43.400 --> 13:44.860
He has those phones.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.950
Use the information wisely.

13:46.990 --> 13:48.160
Please.

13:49.490 --> 13:50.410
Thank you.

13:54.580 --> 13:54.830
[Jimmy] Why do I get
the feeling

13:55.790 --> 13:57.120
You two-
You and the hot girl,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.790
you have some kind of thing?

14:00.670 --> 14:00.960
[Jake]
There is no thing.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.550
I can't believe you would do
something like that to Leslie.

14:04.590 --> 14:04.800
And it's clear.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.140
This Alisha girl has gotten you
into some criminal activity.

14:08.180 --> 14:08.550
I'm surprised at you.

14:09.510 --> 14:10.930
She's playing us.
That's all.

14:10.970 --> 14:12.350
I'm putting my trust
in you, Jake.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.730
Please don't let me down.

14:16.940 --> 14:17.850
The union boss.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.270
[Jake] Frank Simon is
meeting with Saul.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.610
I asked Wolf to plant bugs
in Frank's car.

14:25.650 --> 14:26.530
And his house.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.860
It's not by the book. But-

14:28.910 --> 14:31.240
It might give us a little bit
of an edge.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.780
I wanna tie Frank to
those phones.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.410
And force him to roll on Saul.

14:34.450 --> 14:35.450
How?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
Yup.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.250
Jimmy!

14:54.720 --> 14:55.640
Jimmy! Look out!

14:56.680 --> 14:57.890
Arrgh!

15:05.650 --> 15:07.150
[Jake]
Are you okay there, buddy?

15:07.190 --> 15:09.320
I just got hit by the back
of a truck.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.410
That then ran over my face!

15:11.450 --> 15:11.740
How do you think I am?

15:13.160 --> 15:14.950
I don't think you want me to
answer that question.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.160
No, I need help.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.370
Jake, please help me.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.330
Don't leave me!

15:21.790 --> 15:22.840
This is broken.

15:23.500 --> 15:23.790
I need a doctor.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.800
So you got the bug planted in
Frank's truck?

15:26.840 --> 15:27.760
Nice job.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.130
Yup.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.430
[Vic] [On recording] It's good
being in business together.

15:31.470 --> 15:32.970
[Frank] We're not in
business together.

15:33.010 --> 15:33.510
I warned you about that.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.770
[Vic] Just take the money.
And be quiet.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.020
This proves it.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.190
Saul is using the union boss,
Frank, to lose shipments.

15:42.230 --> 15:45.150
But we still can't tie Frank
to the stolen phones, tool.

15:45.190 --> 15:47.820
But the bug proves that he's
taking Saul's money.

15:47.860 --> 15:48.900
No, no.

15:48.940 --> 15:49.280
What the union boys said today,

15:50.570 --> 15:52.280
when Frank found out Saul
jacked those phones,

15:52.320 --> 15:53.620
he threatened to turn him in.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.740
So the money is a payoff.

15:54.780 --> 15:55.120
It's all going for strike pay.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.120
So Frank can keep food on the
tables of the Stevedores.

15:58.160 --> 15:58.500
[Jake]
So buddy's on the take.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.160
But he's on the take for all
the right reasons.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.250
[Des]
Complicated man.

16:02.290 --> 16:03.830
He seems like a good guy to me.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.290
Plus, he's championing demands
for increased

16:05.340 --> 16:05.630
security down at
the ports.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.920
Is part of the latest strike
negotiations. And last night-

16:08.960 --> 16:09.920
He even ran a bingo game.

16:09.970 --> 16:10.170
That's a good boss.

16:11.130 --> 16:11.380
[Jimmy]
Frank was at bingo.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.010
The night I was supposed to meet
my whistle blower.

16:14.050 --> 16:14.970
We gotta get Frank into
protection.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.560
[Jake] You feel like Jimmy's
not telling us everything?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.230
Yeah. He pulled me off a job
we were doing in Ireland too.

16:22.810 --> 16:26.860
He's just acting a little more
Jimmy-y than usual, ya know?

16:26.900 --> 16:27.110
[Wolf] The only thing
I can figure is

16:28.570 --> 16:30.110
he's under a lot of pressure
to bag this gun dealer.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.150
Boys, we got trouble.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.700
[Jake]
Is he alive, or what?

16:34.700 --> 16:35.700
Unconscious.

16:45.580 --> 16:45.880
Check it.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.840
Sure. I'm unarmed.
But I'll check it.

16:56.140 --> 16:56.890
That's Frank. And-

16:57.800 --> 16:59.680
I'm pretty
sure he's dead.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.650
[Jimmy] Headache?
I get those too.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.030
People can be so annoying.

17:12.070 --> 17:13.780
It's nice to see you.
You look super pretty.

17:15.070 --> 17:16.410
Look, I'm a union man myself.

17:16.450 --> 17:18.160
I don't hurt union men.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.490
Frank's strike was disrupting
your smuggling business.

17:20.530 --> 17:22.330
You know you might have fooled
Alisha, but not me.

17:22.370 --> 17:24.540
I knew you were a cop the second
I laid eyes on you.

17:24.580 --> 17:25.960
Frank put us onto you.

17:27.170 --> 17:29.170
To blow the whistle on
your gun business.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.250
I don't see how.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.170
I'm not in the gun business.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.340
Somebody set me up.

17:33.380 --> 17:33.760
Yeah, who?

17:35.010 --> 17:36.300
I've made enemies.
Some you might even know.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.760
Look, forty people in

17:37.800 --> 17:39.300
my bar saw me when
Frank was murdered.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.560
So I hope, for you sake, you got
another card to play.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.310
'Cause I got a
whole hand full.

17:44.350 --> 17:45.600
Tell me where the guns are.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.520
Or I'm gonna lose my temper.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.070
[Des] OK, so I compared that
hand written letter

17:50.110 --> 17:51.610
from the whistle blower

17:51.650 --> 17:53.780
with some notes that we found in
Frank's truck.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.900
Let me guess.

17:54.940 --> 17:55.240
It wasn't a match.

17:56.650 --> 17:57.950
Yeah. The stroke pressure is
completely different.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.200
So Frank's not the
whistleblower,

17:59.240 --> 18:00.120
then why was he killed?

18:00.990 --> 18:02.120
Tell me where the guns are!

18:02.160 --> 18:03.080
[Jake]
Hey!

18:03.120 --> 18:04.000
[Leslie]
Jimmy!

18:04.410 --> 18:05.330
[bang]

18:05.370 --> 18:06.500
You okay?

18:06.540 --> 18:07.870
Yeah. I'm fine.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.540
Saul's lawyers are
on their way.

18:09.580 --> 18:12.710
Jimmy. His alibi checks out. We
can't hold him for now.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.010
Sit down.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.140
Did you just cuff me?

18:26.600 --> 18:27.810
Frank isn't our
whistle blower.

18:27.850 --> 18:28.770
So we got nothing on Saul.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.310
I'm really out on a limb,
Jake.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.730
I need results. I really do.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.610
My career. Other people's
lives are at stake.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.360
And it's all on me.

18:39.410 --> 18:39.950
What is?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.580
Come clean with me. Tell me
what's going on. Please.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.710
Okay. I was sent to South Africa
to stop a shipment of guns.

18:48.750 --> 18:48.960
But I screwed it up.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.960
My informant double crossed me.
And the guns went out.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.630
The same shipment that
due to land here today?

18:56.840 --> 18:59.010
I'm responsible for an
armory of weapons-

18:59.050 --> 19:01.010
That'll end up on the street
killing people.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.930
I guess the pressure's just
getting to me.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.850
That is actually pretty bad.

19:04.890 --> 19:05.140
Jake, me and the guys,

19:06.730 --> 19:10.940
we are a highly elite team of
well trained professionals.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.570
Yeah. So you keep proving to me
over and over again.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.110
The boss is gonna fire me.

19:16.150 --> 19:17.530
I can't lose my job, Jake.

19:18.950 --> 19:19.240
Alright. Wait here.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.740
If Saul's involved in this, we
have to take him down.

19:22.780 --> 19:23.200
So I can redeem myself.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.950
Wait a minute. Where do you
think you're going?

19:26.790 --> 19:28.000
You can't go!

19:28.040 --> 19:29.460
Don't leave me Jake.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.460
Jake!

19:36.880 --> 19:37.920
Oh! I'm so sorry.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.680
Here. Let me help you with that.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.760
So sorry.

19:42.890 --> 19:43.760
Again.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.400
Ah, you're quick.
I'll give you that.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.610
Open your hand.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.230
Open it.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.530
Okay Rose. This
is getting creepy.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.440
Why are you following me?

19:59.490 --> 19:59.820
Because you're pulling

20:01.110 --> 20:03.410
an identity theft scam with
your half sister.

20:03.450 --> 20:03.740
What?

20:04.990 --> 20:06.280
Pam. You know, the lovely girl
you told me

20:06.330 --> 20:07.790
you met in
the group home.

20:09.660 --> 20:14.420
Okay. Look. I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.790
But you have to trust
me when I say-

20:15.840 --> 20:17.590
If I don't do what Pam wants,

20:17.630 --> 20:19.670
there will be serious
consequences.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.300
What kind of consequences?

20:21.340 --> 20:23.180
She wasn't exactly a
caring big sister.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.010
She's the one who taught me
how to steal.

20:25.050 --> 20:27.220
And basically abandoned
me for years at a time.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.100
I know you've had a
hard life, Sloan.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.020
But you gotta see
where I'm coming from.

20:31.270 --> 20:35.020
I don't trust anything
that you say or do?

20:35.940 --> 20:37.190
Why would I?

20:37.230 --> 20:38.650
Yeah. Why would I?

20:45.530 --> 20:46.070
Saul. Wait.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.410
I don't want to be in this
with you, trust me.

20:49.450 --> 20:51.450
Well, somebody's trying to
frame me for Frank's murder.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.910
And all this gun business.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.170
I'm here to tell you-

20:54.210 --> 20:54.540
that it isn't me.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.170
Well you get me out of
whatever this is.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.170
Or else.

20:59.590 --> 21:02.130
Oh and Jake. A word of warning
for old time's sake.

21:03.670 --> 21:04.890
People on the buying end of
this gun business-

21:06.090 --> 21:07.970
Tend to make me look
like Mother Theresa.

21:17.230 --> 21:17.730
This is the last time.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.650
You can't hold the past
over me any more.

21:21.860 --> 21:22.860
Sloan. Your past is who you are.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.740
You have no idea who I am.

21:25.530 --> 21:26.660
I raised you, remember?

21:26.700 --> 21:28.280
If you wanna call it that.

21:28.320 --> 21:28.530
We're done.

21:29.990 --> 21:31.040
I'm serious. I don't want my
cut on this. It's over.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.040
Now that you've found
your real family?

21:35.330 --> 21:37.330
What kind of con are you
running on those people?

21:38.040 --> 21:38.420
No con.

21:39.710 --> 21:40.920
Which means that you've been
conning yourself.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.890
[Otto Brewer] Yeah. I ran this
race last year.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.640
Didn't realize I still
had the tag on.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.020
So you work security for SeaWay.

21:56.060 --> 21:57.900
So do we, contract, anyway.

21:57.940 --> 22:00.690
Do you mind explaining why you
blew through the strike barrier?

22:00.730 --> 22:01.770
Sorry about that.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.150
I didn't hurt anyone, did I?

22:03.190 --> 22:04.190
No, but we found blood
in the car.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.070
The strike has been
hard on my job.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.120
One of the picketers
tried to slash my tires

22:09.160 --> 22:09.450
when they were holding
me on the line.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.540
I got out. He swiped at me, so
I barreled out of the there.

22:14.870 --> 22:15.210
We should notify the police.

22:16.410 --> 22:17.250
I don't wanna press
charges or anything.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.210
I mean, I'm okay now.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.170
You were attacked at knifepoint.
Are you sure about that?

22:21.210 --> 22:21.670
Positive.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.300
Thanks for checking
up on me, guys.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.050
Okay. I was watching
that picket line.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.680
There's no way I would have
missed a stabbing.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.770
No way he told us the
whole story.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.020
This has to be connected to
Jimmy's case in some way.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.650
I need to talk to someone.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.780
Okay.

22:49.570 --> 22:49.820
What's going on?

22:51.240 --> 22:54.700
I have something to confess.
But you can't tell Jake.

23:00.250 --> 23:00.540
Oh there's the traitor.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.630
I went back for you, Jimmy.
But you were already gone.

23:03.670 --> 23:06.710
Oh, because I remembered,
I have handcuff keys.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.920
Unfortunately for the
rest of us.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.590
So, are we good here now, or-

23:10.630 --> 23:13.220
No. No. I'm trying to explain
the importance of this mission

23:13.260 --> 23:13.560
to Mr. Wolf.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.850
But suddenly, he's not
a team player.

23:15.890 --> 23:17.020
Because Jimmy, I checked.

23:17.060 --> 23:17.310
They don't know we're here.

23:18.390 --> 23:20.310
Nobody knows we're here.
Why is that?

23:20.350 --> 23:21.310
Because.

23:21.350 --> 23:22.270
Because.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.070
Because - wait.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.400
You didn't tell them
where we were, did you?

23:27.440 --> 23:28.360
Not yet.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.570
Good. Good.

23:30.530 --> 23:32.240
The guns in Africa-

23:32.280 --> 23:33.200
Went missing.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.240
So I tracked them here.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.250
Then I needed your help. And-

23:37.290 --> 23:37.580
You pulled me off

23:38.750 --> 23:40.670
a job in Ireland without
getting clearance.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.040
Have you lost your mind, Jim?

23:43.080 --> 23:44.500
The office doesn't know what
happened in South Africa.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.500
How is that even possible?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.470
I fudged a few details.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.760
Technically, people still
think I'm there.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.180
You're not there, Jimmy.
You're here.

23:53.220 --> 23:53.930
Yeah. I realize that.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.970
So where does the
office think I am?

23:57.770 --> 23:58.100
Ireland?

23:59.520 --> 24:01.480
This place is very similar.
So it's barely a lie.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.310
- Jimmy!
- Ow!

24:03.350 --> 24:06.020
Do I need to be here for this
little domestic -

24:06.610 --> 24:07.360
Guys, listen.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.740
I needed your help
cleaning up my mess.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.320
I don't wanna lose my job.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.030
Being a cop is all I have.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.490
I'm gonna do some valium.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.450
And if we get the guns now,

24:19.500 --> 24:21.120
that's all anybody'll care
about, right?

24:21.160 --> 24:21.460
We'll be heroes.

24:22.830 --> 24:23.790
[Jake] I can't believe I'm
actually gonna say this,

24:23.830 --> 24:24.080
but Jimmy's right.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.630
The stakes are too high. We
gotta finish this thing.

24:26.670 --> 24:26.960
[message sound]

24:28.000 --> 24:29.170
Our whistle blower's
in trouble.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.680
When the whistle blower's
letter came in,

24:33.720 --> 24:34.890
I knew it was my chance to
make things right.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.760
Okay. If no one knows you're
here, how'd you get it?

24:38.810 --> 24:41.430
It came to our division. I got
word. I diverted it.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.390
How?

24:42.440 --> 24:43.480
Doesn't matter.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.560
Yes it does.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.770
No, what matters is-

24:45.810 --> 24:46.060
We got the whistle blower.

24:47.190 --> 24:47.480
And now we're gonna make
things right.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.400
I'm seriously thinking about
shooting you in the testes.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.320
Just to make sure you don't
pass on your genes

24:53.360 --> 24:55.120
to some poor
unfortunate offspring.

24:56.620 --> 24:56.830
Don't mind him.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.330
Yeah, I don't think I'm the
one who needs to worry.

24:59.370 --> 25:00.200
Ow.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.170
Whoa, whoa.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.920
Easy now.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.170
Wolf.

25:08.750 --> 25:09.670
Whoa!
Hey!

25:09.710 --> 25:10.630
Don't move!

25:10.670 --> 25:11.550
[bang]

25:14.510 --> 25:15.220
I got him.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.260
This is Federal Agent
Jimmy O'Rourke.

25:18.510 --> 25:20.560
You are safe now. I am
here to protect you.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.440
Alisha.

25:26.060 --> 25:26.940
Hey baby.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.030
[Des] It's too bad Wolf
couldn't catch that guy-

25:32.070 --> 25:33.690
who put a gun to your head.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.860
So why come forward now?

25:35.490 --> 25:36.620
I want to help.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.160
You want to help?

25:38.700 --> 25:38.990
Is that so?

25:40.280 --> 25:40.490
Saul's been taking bigger and
bigger risks.

25:41.950 --> 25:44.160
I don't want to go down
because of his recklessness.

25:44.210 --> 25:44.460
So you blew the whistle.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.540
When you came at him
after I vouched for you-

25:47.790 --> 25:50.000
He knew there was a rat.
He tried to kill me.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.170
So you contacted me
for my protection.

25:52.210 --> 25:52.510
Don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.050
[Alisha] Saul doesn't
exactly take kindly

25:55.130 --> 25:56.840
to people who stab him
in the back.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.970
Not on my watch.
Don't you worry.

25:59.010 --> 26:01.180
Alright. This is Saul's inside
man,

26:01.220 --> 26:01.470
who's paid to lose
shipments.

26:02.890 --> 26:04.680
This is Otto Brewer. He's a
SeaWay security guard.

26:04.730 --> 26:04.940
You know him?

26:05.890 --> 26:06.190
[Alisha]
Yeah, he works for Saul.

26:07.270 --> 26:07.600
He hasn't been
trusting me lately.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.110
[Mal] Otto was driving the car
that blew through

26:10.150 --> 26:10.520
the picket line.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.730
Then lied to us about why.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.070
I matched his employee
login with

26:14.360 --> 26:16.320
whoever was tampering with
SeaWay's manifest.

26:16.360 --> 26:16.660
[Jimmy] You'll wear a wire.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.410
We'll get this man to tell me
the location of Saul's guns.

26:20.450 --> 26:23.410
[Alisha] I'm burned.
Otto might know.

26:24.200 --> 26:24.580
That's pretty convenient.

26:25.910 --> 26:27.000
Like I said, don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.380
I need a drink. My nerves are
getting the best of me.

26:31.420 --> 26:32.460
Do you mind?

26:34.380 --> 26:35.840
Don't try anything stupid.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.050
Sure. Have a drink.

26:40.970 --> 26:41.260
Sit down.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.850
[Jimmy] Doyle. You're acting all
jealousy with her.

26:44.890 --> 26:47.060
It's clear your annoyed at the
chemistry with have.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.730
Not you and me. But her and me.

26:48.770 --> 26:49.850
Yeah, that's it Jim.

26:51.610 --> 26:51.900
Hello there.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.940
What's wrong, Jakey?
Always so serious.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.240
Turning over a new leaf, are we?

26:57.780 --> 27:00.530
A girl needs to change her
profession every now and then.

27:01.950 --> 27:03.530
You can't figure out
what I'm up to

27:03.580 --> 27:05.120
and it's driving you nuts.

27:07.330 --> 27:08.960
I know you're playing at
something.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.210
I thought you were
big boy smart.

27:10.960 --> 27:11.250
I guess I had you wrong.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.050
Obviously you want Saul to
go down for all this.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.340
I just can't figure out
how this

27:16.380 --> 27:18.340
particular
play is helping you.

27:19.090 --> 27:19.510
It's helping you.

27:20.800 --> 27:21.890
I can tell you and your
friends need a hand.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.100
You ought to trust people more.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.100
[Jimmy] Let's go. Now.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.400
[Leslie] I warned the woman-

27:32.440 --> 27:33.900
who's I.D. Sloan stole

27:33.940 --> 27:36.690
in time for her to take steps to
protect herself.

27:36.730 --> 27:37.570
Good.

27:38.070 --> 27:39.150
Thank you.

27:39.200 --> 27:39.490
You still adamant

27:40.910 --> 27:42.370
about not telling me the name
of your accomplice?

27:42.410 --> 27:43.410
I can't.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.700
You know we have to
formally charge you.

27:46.740 --> 27:47.040
Yes. And-

27:48.370 --> 27:50.420
I wanna confess to
stealing the Doyle's money.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.080
On the record. I did it.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.210
[Tinny] You can't do that.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.130
Jake'll flip.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.590
And it'll ruin your life.

27:58.630 --> 27:58.970
Well I have to.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.220
I can't get their cash back.
This is the only way.

28:06.140 --> 28:07.140
Leslie.

28:07.770 --> 28:08.100
Are you okay?

28:09.520 --> 28:13.230
Yeah, it's nothing. I gotta
tell Jake about this.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.030
[Jake] Hello.

28:20.070 --> 28:21.110
[click]

28:21.990 --> 28:22.160
What the hell are you doing?

28:23.490 --> 28:23.780
This is not the time to talk to
your girlfriend.

28:25.200 --> 28:25.490
Alisha's mic is connected to
your phone, remember.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.120
[Alisha] [On phone] I'm going
in to the security office.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.830
He's here.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.840
Otto.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.050
Why are you here?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.260
Saul sent me for the shipment.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.550
Why is she silent?

28:45.600 --> 28:46.510
Shut up.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.390
She's playing us.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.560
[Alisha] Tell me where it is.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.690
We'll start unloading now.

28:53.730 --> 28:54.060
Saul is pissed.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.110
We don't want him to be pissed
at you, believe me.

28:58.730 --> 28:59.440
Okay.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.570
It's container I.D.-

29:02.400 --> 29:04.490
Three four five eight one.

29:05.990 --> 29:07.780
See? We got the number.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.750
Ahh! Jimmy. What are you-?

29:13.210 --> 29:14.120
Jimmy!

29:15.210 --> 29:16.840
Jimmy. Jimmy!

29:19.170 --> 29:20.750
You're not giving me much of
an incentive

29:20.800 --> 29:22.300
not to kill you right now.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.050
Jimmy, listen to me. Okay?

29:24.090 --> 29:24.470
She is a criminal.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.640
B'ys. I'm sorry. I know I
let you down.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.010
But I gotta do this on my own.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.100
She can't be trusted. Alisha
cannot be trusted.

29:31.140 --> 29:31.350
This is my problem now.

29:33.020 --> 29:34.140
I should've never dragged you
two into it in the first place.

29:34.980 --> 29:36.190
I ride it alone from here.

29:36.230 --> 29:37.020
No, no, no!

29:37.900 --> 29:40.360
Jimmy! You can't trust her!

29:42.360 --> 29:43.650
You better have a handcuff key.

29:46.860 --> 29:47.120
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

29:48.490 --> 29:50.780
Otto Brewer is Vic Saul's
inside man at the Port.

29:50.830 --> 29:51.160
If we're gonna find those
guns, he's key.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.120
Yeah, but searching his house?
Seems a little dangerous.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.790
Maybe we should wait
for the cops.

29:56.830 --> 29:59.090
I told you what I heard from my
cop source in forensics.

30:00.420 --> 30:02.050
There were two kinds of
blood in the car that

30:02.090 --> 30:03.800
Otto crashed
through the picket line.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.220
Right. And torn upholstery
indicating a struggle.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.050
Which means there was another
person in the car-

30:08.090 --> 30:09.140
With Otto. Maybe
fighting with him.

30:10.050 --> 30:11.220
What the hell happened in there?

30:11.260 --> 30:11.560
No idea.

30:12.810 --> 30:13.850
That's why we're gonna
search Otto's house.

30:13.890 --> 30:14.730
[phone rings]

30:17.190 --> 30:19.150
We have a bit of a Sloan
situation.

30:19.190 --> 30:20.860
Do I really want to
hear about it?

30:20.900 --> 30:21.860
She's confessing to the
robbery of your cash.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.440
She knows you'll get it back
through insurance

30:24.490 --> 30:25.530
if she turns herself in.

30:25.570 --> 30:25.900
What?

30:26.990 --> 30:27.860
And she asked me not
to tell Jake.

30:27.910 --> 30:28.780
[man]
Help!

30:29.490 --> 30:30.410
Help me!

30:31.910 --> 30:32.790
Poppy?

30:33.540 --> 30:34.790
He held me captive!

30:34.830 --> 30:35.370
Help me!

30:36.870 --> 30:39.290
Tinny, you might want to send
a car over to where I am.

30:39.330 --> 30:40.210
Right now.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.050
Say the wrong number.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.640
[Jake] She must have told
Otto to lie about the guns.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.100
She's in deep this time.

30:56.140 --> 30:56.430
I can tell you one thing.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.640
She's not working for
Saul anymore.

30:58.690 --> 30:58.980
How do you know that?

31:00.230 --> 31:00.440
She's trying to frame
him for everything.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.690
At first it was Frank's
murder. Now it's the guns.

31:05.860 --> 31:08.530
This whole thing.
It's Alisha's deal.

31:09.320 --> 31:09.610
Alisha's our gun dealer?

31:10.820 --> 31:12.240
She's pretending to be the
whistle blower

31:12.280 --> 31:12.580
so we'll protect her from Saul.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.830
And then she can get away
scott free with the guns.

31:15.870 --> 31:18.040
But how does she know there even
is a real whistle blower?

31:18.080 --> 31:20.460
My guess- she's got him. And
whoever it is, is in danger.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.420
[phone rings]

31:21.460 --> 31:21.710
She could have Jimmy.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.710
Yeah. We better find him before
something happens to him.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.090
Yeah. Or we could let nature
take its course.

31:26.710 --> 31:27.010
Dad.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.050
We've got somebody you
need to meet. Now.

31:30.470 --> 31:31.590
Alright. Text me the address.
I'll be right there.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.140
Let's split up. Whether we
like it or not, we'd better-

31:36.180 --> 31:37.230
Find Jimmy.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.870
Hi Jimmy.

31:54.030 --> 31:54.910
[whack]

32:04.330 --> 32:05.420
You should really keep
your door locked.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.170
Not that a locked door has ever
stopped you before.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.720
I'm guessing you're the one
who talked Sloan

32:11.760 --> 32:13.220
into going to the cops.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.470
No. But I am telling you to
leave her alone.

32:16.180 --> 32:16.470
I'm her real sister.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.480
Yeah. But she doesn't
need you in her life.

32:20.100 --> 32:20.440
Is that a threat?

32:21.730 --> 32:23.190
No. If I was threatening you,
you'd know it.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.190
Get out.

32:24.900 --> 32:25.900
Little Sloan Doyle.

32:27.020 --> 32:29.030
Yeah, she has a few
other last names.

32:29.070 --> 32:29.400
What's that supposed to mean?

32:30.530 --> 32:31.990
Oh. She'd done this kind
of thing before.

32:33.110 --> 32:34.780
I think daddy Jake might
want to know.

32:36.910 --> 32:38.990
[Jake] So, this is the
guy Otto Brewer-

32:39.040 --> 32:39.330
had stashed in his basement?

32:40.910 --> 32:43.830
His name is Doug Reynolds. He
works data entry for SeaWay.

32:43.870 --> 32:46.170
When he found out that someone
was tampering with the manifest-

32:46.210 --> 32:48.840
to lose shipments. He contacted
the Feds anonymously.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.090
But Otto caught him.

32:50.420 --> 32:52.760
He wanted to know how much info
Doug gave Jimmy,

32:52.800 --> 32:53.050
so he beat it out of him.

32:54.090 --> 32:55.470
So he's obviously
Jimmy's source.

32:56.220 --> 32:56.470
What info did he have?

32:57.510 --> 32:58.890
How Otto lost the stolen
shipments.

32:58.930 --> 32:59.100
But that's all he knows.

33:00.270 --> 33:00.520
Doug was driving the car that
crashed

33:01.310 --> 33:01.560
through that picket line-

33:02.600 --> 33:02.890
Because he had Otto, that
psycho,

33:04.020 --> 33:04.350
who was in the
back seat with a gun.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.730
You think he can help us find
the shipment

33:06.770 --> 33:06.980
that's being
unloaded today?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.780
Yeah. Although the cops
want to keep us away.

33:09.820 --> 33:10.780
Let me give it a try.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.450
I need to tell you something-

33:14.490 --> 33:15.030
you're not gonna like.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.950
Sloan's decided to confess
to the cops

33:17.990 --> 33:19.200
about stealing our money.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.290
So we can claim insurance.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.830
What? Why?

33:22.870 --> 33:23.120
I don't know.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.290
But she just went into Tinny and
Leslie and spilled it all.

33:26.330 --> 33:27.170
[phone rings]

33:31.260 --> 33:32.170
Did you find Jimmy?

33:32.210 --> 33:33.090
Oh yeah.

33:34.670 --> 33:35.930
He's got himself into
a little mess.

33:47.060 --> 33:50.860
Alisha - not - Alisha bad.

33:50.900 --> 33:52.820
She's the gun dealer. We know.
But-

33:53.650 --> 33:55.990
Head. Alisha pounded head.

33:57.160 --> 33:57.990
She was gonna freeze us
all to death.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.160
Come one. I got the real
container number.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.660
One five two five eight nine.
Let's go.

34:03.580 --> 34:04.210
Give me your gun. I lost mine.

34:05.290 --> 34:06.670
I'm not giving you my gun.
You tool.

34:07.250 --> 34:07.460
That's an order.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.710
Oh is it? Good for you b'y.
Here. Try that.

34:11.750 --> 34:11.960
Seriously?

34:13.090 --> 34:13.460
Try not to hurt
yourself with that.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.090
Jimmy, you're bleeding pretty
bad there, buddy.

34:17.260 --> 34:18.430
I'll fix him up.

34:18.470 --> 34:20.180
Jimmy. I swear to God-

34:21.510 --> 34:23.770
Sometimes, I don't know if you
does this stuff

34:23.810 --> 34:25.390
as some creepy
form of self harm.

34:26.310 --> 34:27.850
Or if you're just some moron.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.190
Self?

34:30.900 --> 34:32.860
S-s-s-screw you, Man.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.690
B'ys. Let's go.

34:40.660 --> 34:41.580
Here.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.200
This is it.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.080
We're too late.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.500
Hey.

34:50.830 --> 34:51.130
The temp workers.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.340
They're smuggling the guns
out in their bags.

34:55.550 --> 34:56.630
We gotta follow them.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.930
That's what we were
trying to do.

35:16.610 --> 35:17.820
[Jake]
Alright. End of the line.

35:18.490 --> 35:19.660
No sign of Alisha.

35:19.700 --> 35:19.950
[Jake]
We just have to wait for

35:21.070 --> 35:22.030
backup. They'll
be here any minute.

35:22.070 --> 35:22.370
[Jimmy]
No time.

35:23.450 --> 35:24.160
We can't let
those guns get away,.

35:24.950 --> 35:25.950
Unfortunately he's right.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.710
Jimmy. Wait.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.130
Alright. Listen, Jimmy.
Play it cool.

35:36.170 --> 35:38.220
Is that some kind of joke?
I can't feel my arse.

35:39.010 --> 35:40.220
We blow right through.

35:40.260 --> 35:40.590
[Jake]
Blow right through?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.470
Not one gun between the
three of us, alright?

35:43.510 --> 35:44.970
And they got a friggin'
arsenal.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.230
So we improvise.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.480
Is he always like this?

35:50.020 --> 35:51.190
Sadly, yes.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.020
Molotov cocktails, anyone?

35:55.980 --> 35:57.320
- Here we go.
- No, no, Jimmy!

36:05.030 --> 36:07.160
So much for our element
of surprise.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.620
Was that glass or plastic?

36:08.660 --> 36:09.910
Son of a bitch.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.210
Arrgh!

36:13.250 --> 36:14.210
I'm on fire!

36:15.130 --> 36:16.130
I'm on fire again!

36:17.420 --> 36:18.670
Hang on. Hang on.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.470
[punch]

36:22.510 --> 36:23.430
[punch]

36:23.470 --> 36:24.430
[whack]

36:24.470 --> 36:25.350
Stop hitting me!

36:28.770 --> 36:29.680
Arrgh!

36:29.730 --> 36:30.640
[whack]

36:31.350 --> 36:32.690
You're kicking me?

36:32.730 --> 36:34.190
[Wolf]
Stop, drop and roll, Jim!

36:34.230 --> 36:35.270
Stop drop and roll!

36:35.310 --> 36:36.440
B'ys! A little help!

36:46.030 --> 36:47.160
[explosion]

36:50.450 --> 36:51.370
The coast is clear.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.120
You're welcome.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.540
Did you ever see anyone get
frost burnt

36:56.590 --> 36:58.130
and burnt in the same day?

36:58.170 --> 36:59.340
Not until today.

37:01.090 --> 37:02.010
Is there a plan?

37:02.050 --> 37:02.800
Yeah.

37:03.380 --> 37:04.390
You go that way.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.760
Come on.

37:08.810 --> 37:09.680
[bang]

37:11.310 --> 37:11.480
Hi.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.270
You know what? We should
probably just leave them alone.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.600
And let them all kill
each other.

37:15.650 --> 37:15.900
No!

37:17.480 --> 37:19.360
One thing we can agree on is the
need to kill you two first.

37:19.400 --> 37:19.940
You're all under arrest.

37:21.110 --> 37:22.360
[Alisha] How does that
happen exactly?

37:22.400 --> 37:22.780
Because we got a bunch of guns.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.030
And you two, you just
have to have him.

37:25.070 --> 37:25.990
He's got me too.

37:26.030 --> 37:26.950
[sirens]

37:26.990 --> 37:27.620
It's over.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.240
Surrender now!

37:30.120 --> 37:31.160
[Saul]
I took you in.

37:32.080 --> 37:32.790
And this is how you repay me.

37:34.250 --> 37:35.830
Framing me for a gun deal I had
nothing to do with!

37:35.870 --> 37:36.790
[bang]

37:36.830 --> 37:37.750
Ahhh!

37:37.790 --> 37:38.710
[bang]

37:38.750 --> 37:39.670
[bang]

37:43.880 --> 37:44.970
The guns are here.

37:48.510 --> 37:49.510
Where's Alisha?

37:56.730 --> 37:58.110
[voice on phone] Hello Sergeant Bennett.

37:58.150 --> 37:58.520
This is Dr. Brown's office.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.230
We have the results of the
CAT scan.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.740
The doctor would like to talk to
you as soon as possible.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.530
Please call us back when
you get this.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.000
[Jimmy] Vic Saul's on
death's door.

38:13.040 --> 38:13.330
At least we got him.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.080
Yeah, well. Unfortunately, we
didn't get everyone.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.840
Are we sad Alisha got away?

38:20.920 --> 38:21.630
Sad how?

38:22.250 --> 38:23.670
Come on, Doyle.

38:23.710 --> 38:25.930
You wanted her bad.
It was obvious.

38:26.550 --> 38:27.760
Yeah. Not much.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.300
But I will have a toast.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.600
To Sergeant Leslie Bennett.

38:35.060 --> 38:36.060
Oh Man!

38:36.100 --> 38:36.440
So what are you gonna do?

38:37.770 --> 38:39.610
You and Wolf? You
think you'll make up, or what?

38:39.650 --> 38:39.940
You know what?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.900
I don't care if Wolf Fathead
is pissed.

38:42.940 --> 38:44.280
I don't care about him at all.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.570
Okay? And if he says anything
to me,

38:47.610 --> 38:49.490
or gives me the slightest
bit of grief-

38:49.530 --> 38:50.490
You know what I'm gonna
say to him?

38:50.530 --> 38:51.490
No what?

38:53.330 --> 38:54.830
Lie to me again, Jim, we'll
see what happens.

38:55.410 --> 38:55.660
It wasn't a lie.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.170
I was withholding information
that you weren't

38:58.210 --> 38:59.460
classified to have.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.210
So shut it.

39:01.290 --> 39:02.670
Watch your back around here,
Jake.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.000
Could be consequences for
everything

39:04.050 --> 39:04.710
we were just a part of.

39:05.260 --> 39:05.510
Most right.

39:06.670 --> 39:06.970
The people those guns
were meant for-

39:08.130 --> 39:08.470
They're not gonna be
so happy with you.

39:09.590 --> 39:11.100
Let's not forget who's in
charge here.

39:14.350 --> 39:15.310
Sure b'y.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.770
- I am.
- I know.

39:17.810 --> 39:19.390
- I'm in charge.
- You're in charge, yeah.

39:19.440 --> 39:19.730
Wolf. I'm in charge.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.270
I know. You're the king,
b'y.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.190
[Mal]
Safe travels.

39:28.240 --> 39:28.530
What?

39:29.820 --> 39:31.450
I think you need to have a
moment with Sloan.

39:31.990 --> 39:32.910
Alone.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.960
[Jake] So the whole
thing was a scam.

39:46.710 --> 39:47.800
You were playing me.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.420
No.
I mean, at first-

39:49.470 --> 39:50.630
The DNA test?

39:52.470 --> 39:53.680
I had someone forge it.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.220
How did you know about your
mother and me?

39:58.270 --> 40:00.190
Wait a minute. Was she even
really your mother?

40:00.230 --> 40:01.100
Yes.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.110
That's why I picked you.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.360
I confessed to the cops.

40:10.650 --> 40:11.990
Your family is gonna get all
your money back

40:12.030 --> 40:13.110
through insurance.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.700
I didn't want you to do that.

40:14.740 --> 40:15.620
It's too late.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.410
When I got to know you-

40:20.660 --> 40:22.080
I just wanted a family.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.040
A real family.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.380
Not the assholes that were
always in my life.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.430
And then I realized I
wanted it to be real.

40:34.010 --> 40:34.680
It's not real.

40:35.970 --> 40:38.020
I'm not your father.
You're not my daughter.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.180
You're a liar.

40:40.850 --> 40:41.940
And I'm an idiot.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.560
If it weren't for you,
I'd be dead.

40:48.900 --> 40:51.820
Which is why I want to face the
consequences for what I did.

40:54.450 --> 40:57.280
I know I can never make it up to
your for betraying you.

40:59.370 --> 41:00.540
But I can try.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.420
I'm actually sorry that it
isn't true.

41:06.670 --> 41:08.840
I was kinda liking having
you as my kid.

41:15.430 --> 41:17.810
I'm sure it wasn't easy for
you to come clean like this.

41:19.970 --> 41:21.140
Now you're free.

41:22.270 --> 41:25.020
No more burdens.
No responsibilities.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.730
I never thought about you
that way.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.320
So what now?

41:34.450 --> 41:35.610
Where are you gonna go?

41:36.410 --> 41:37.740
I have an aunt in Gander.

41:40.370 --> 41:42.080
I'm gonna go there. Graduate.

41:43.620 --> 41:45.080
Well, I'll always be
here for you.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.750
I know that probably makes me a
sucker. But-

41:48.380 --> 41:51.670
There you go. There'll always
be a place here for you with us.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.130
With me.

41:53.170 --> 41:53.630
That doesn't make you
a sucker.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.840
This bullshit about you turning
yourself in.

41:56.890 --> 41:57.850
You can forget about it.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.850
I want you to have a future.

42:00.600 --> 42:00.810
And you can't have one

42:02.390 --> 42:04.560
with a massive friggin' criminal
record following you around.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.480
Then you-

42:05.520 --> 42:06.400
No.

42:07.480 --> 42:08.440
You wanna make this
right with me?

42:09.730 --> 42:12.990
You live your life.
And you turn it around.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.820
This is a free square. Do
not mess it up. Promise me.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.240
Give me your word.

42:21.660 --> 42:25.160
I promise you. You have my word.

42:33.590 --> 42:34.470
Bye.
