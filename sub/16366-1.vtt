02:29.415 --> 02:33.662
Every night, the same dream,
the same strange planet.

02:34.045 --> 02:35.503
But why?

02:35.713 --> 02:38.251
What are they trying to tell me?

02:44.013 --> 02:47.428
It's been 34 years
since they arrived on this planet.

02:47.683 --> 02:50.090
And not a day passes
that the survivors...

02:50.310 --> 02:54.142
...forced to live in barrier cities,
do not live in fear.

02:54.356 --> 02:56.478
I have vowed to end that fear.

02:56.733 --> 02:59.188
I believe my dreams hold the key.

02:59.402 --> 03:03.945
The question is, will I be
in time to save the Earth?

04:55.679 --> 04:57.339
Where are you?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.811
This is a restricted area.

08:07.444 --> 08:08.689
Do not move!

08:08.904 --> 08:12.273
- What's she doing here captain?
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.361
- You're coming with us.
- Behind you!

08:17.245 --> 08:18.490
Hold it right there!

08:18.705 --> 08:20.781
Damn it. Let's move, people!

08:27.213 --> 08:28.873
Two coming through the wall!

08:29.965 --> 08:32.799
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!

08:35.888 --> 08:37.714
Ryan, Neil, let's go!

08:43.186 --> 08:45.594
- Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
- There's a life form in here.

08:45.814 --> 08:48.305
- There hasn't been life here in years.
- Well, there is now.

08:48.566 --> 08:50.523
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.

08:50.735 --> 08:54.649
Fine! Arrest me. But I'm not
leaving without that life form.

08:56.324 --> 08:57.818
It's gonna be one of those days.

09:13.882 --> 09:16.752
Captain, the transport is not going
to wait for us much longer.

09:16.968 --> 09:19.922
- I understand that.
- It's in bad shape.

09:20.138 --> 09:23.423
Oh please! Tell me we're not
risking our necks for this plant!

09:23.683 --> 09:25.640
I wouldn't even call it a plant.
It's a weed.

09:25.893 --> 09:29.309
- I wouldn't even call it a weed.
- I need a minute to extract it.

09:29.522 --> 09:31.645
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.

09:31.857 --> 09:34.183
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.

09:35.903 --> 09:37.480
Phantoms! We have incoming.

09:37.696 --> 09:40.448
- Captain, we need to get out of here.
- Understood, sergeant.

09:40.699 --> 09:42.324
- Could you hurry please Miss?
- Done.

09:42.576 --> 09:43.821
- Captain?
- Yes, Neil?

09:44.036 --> 09:46.194
Just so you know?
I agree with the "let's get out of here thing. "

09:46.413 --> 09:48.322
Duly noted.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.160
- Can I have this, please?
- Thank you.

10:00.093 --> 10:02.132
- We're surrounded!
- No shit!

10:04.680 --> 10:07.930
- Alright everybody! Just relax.
- Captain, we gotta get to higher ground.

10:08.601 --> 10:10.474
Everyone, up top!

10:12.020 --> 10:13.052
Go, go, go!

10:17.609 --> 10:20.361
- Transport, requesting immediate evac.
- Affirmative.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.149
Up here!

10:30.246 --> 10:32.702
- Captain! - They're right
behind you! - Captain, come on!

10:36.460 --> 10:38.002
I've got you!

10:39.213 --> 10:41.040
- You okay?
- Yeah.

10:41.257 --> 10:43.794
All right, everybody, here they come.

11:20.836 --> 11:21.867
You okay?

11:23.255 --> 11:24.915
You gonna be all right.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.838
Can you give me one good reason
why I shouldn't arrest you?

11:30.095 --> 11:32.846
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.

11:33.097 --> 11:36.798
- Not unlimited clearance. Not without authorization.
- Listen captain. I don't have time for this.

11:37.018 --> 11:39.343
Do you realize you just risked
the lives of my squad?

11:39.562 --> 11:41.934
Look! I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is...

11:42.148 --> 11:45.599
- ... it was worth the lives of you and your men.
- You and your men?

11:45.818 --> 11:47.478
- She thinks you're a man.
- I think she's an idiot.

11:47.736 --> 11:50.274
- I know you're not a man.
- I think you're an idiot too.

11:50.531 --> 11:52.606
- Very funny.
- Well, I do wanna talk about it.

11:52.866 --> 11:54.444
Did it ever occur to you...

11:54.659 --> 11:58.075
...that we would've volunteered to risk
our lives had we been given a choice?

11:58.288 --> 12:00.446
Well, nobody asked you to save me.

12:00.665 --> 12:03.536
I don't believe this.
You have not changed a bit!

12:04.669 --> 12:05.784
Gray?

12:13.844 --> 12:16.300
Yeah. Nice to see you too.

13:13.234 --> 13:15.606
- Welcome back, captain.
- We're clean.

13:15.820 --> 13:19.105
- Let's make sure of that shall we?
- I hate getting scanned.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.772
So, the scanners are probably
worse for us than the Phantoms.

13:21.992 --> 13:25.610
No probably about it captain.
These machines are suspected of causing sterility.

13:25.829 --> 13:28.616
And I wanna have a little Neil Jr.
calling me Daddy someday.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.661
- That's a spooky thought.
- Why are you always busting my chops?

13:31.918 --> 13:33.911
People, let's just do this thing. Alright?

13:34.212 --> 13:35.291
Yes, sir.

13:35.505 --> 13:37.165
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

13:47.975 --> 13:49.802
Okay, next.

13:52.188 --> 13:53.730
Looks like you've gained some weight.

13:53.939 --> 13:56.477
It's called upper-body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.

13:56.692 --> 13:57.890
I'm working on it.

13:58.777 --> 14:01.861
You know, my security rating
allows me to bypass this.

14:02.114 --> 14:04.071
Not today it doesn't.

14:05.534 --> 14:06.778
Something's not right.

14:06.993 --> 14:09.994
- About this mission? Or that woman?
- Both.

14:10.205 --> 14:11.284
Next.

14:11.873 --> 14:13.118
Listen, captain.. I think...

14:13.333 --> 14:15.372
I don't care what you think, doctor.

14:15.626 --> 14:18.627
You're getting scanned
just like everybody else.

14:25.844 --> 14:26.876
Oh shit!

14:27.137 --> 14:28.169
- Captain!
- They got him.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.966
There must be a mistake.

14:30.224 --> 14:32.015
You came in contact with a Phantom sir.
Please remain calm.

14:32.225 --> 14:35.429
Administering treatment shield.

14:35.729 --> 14:38.564
- What level is he?
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.

14:41.359 --> 14:42.734
We have to treat him. Now!

14:42.944 --> 14:45.150
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.

14:45.363 --> 14:47.237
There's no time for that.

14:51.244 --> 14:53.569
Get him to the table.

14:53.829 --> 14:55.703
Hang in there, captain.

15:09.010 --> 15:10.504
Locating pathogens.

15:17.518 --> 15:19.725
Jesus, look at that thing!

15:20.480 --> 15:21.808
- How much more time?
- Not enough.

15:21.848 --> 15:23.183
When he reaches code red,

15:23.184 --> 15:26.691
the treatment shield won't be
able to hold the alien particles.

15:26.902 --> 15:29.310
Engaging bio-etheric laser.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.792
- What's going on?
- Where'd it go?

15:49.007 --> 15:50.287
What the hell is going on?

15:50.550 --> 15:53.669
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.843
- Tracking.
- There's no time.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.009
- Tracking.
- There is no time! You're gonna lose him!

15:59.725 --> 16:01.967
His treatment shield is failing.

16:02.561 --> 16:03.759
Found it.

16:13.446 --> 16:14.775
Come on.

16:49.606 --> 16:51.100
It's all right.

16:54.152 --> 16:56.773
Don't worry.
You'll be back to normal in no time.

16:57.989 --> 17:01.689
Uh.. Doctor, we need
to scan you for infestation.

17:02.076 --> 17:05.657
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.414
Hey, doc.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.161
Thanks for saving him.

17:15.922 --> 17:19.256
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship.

17:19.467 --> 17:22.040
- What's with her?
- What's with her and the captain?

17:22.303 --> 17:25.174
What's with her and that stupid plant?

17:27.183 --> 17:28.346
What?

17:33.314 --> 17:37.263
Forward me the Phantom data and everything
regarding the five spirits collected so far.

17:37.484 --> 17:38.564
Yes, doctor.

17:38.777 --> 17:42.822
Spirits? I thought we weren't
supposed to use the "S" word.

17:43.156 --> 17:45.445
Don't get smart with me.

17:45.784 --> 17:48.950
Now let's see if that
plant does the trick.

18:00.131 --> 18:02.123
It's a match. We've found it.

18:02.383 --> 18:03.462
Yes.

18:03.801 --> 18:05.710
The sixth spirit.

18:05.970 --> 18:08.295
It seemed today you broke
nearly every protocol.

18:08.514 --> 18:11.301
How long do you think this would
have survived outside the barrier?

18:11.517 --> 18:13.890
Aki, you know there are
elements in the council and

18:13.891 --> 18:16.309
military just waiting for
an excuse to shut us down.

18:16.813 --> 18:21.689
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered
this energy in the Phantoms? You.

18:21.902 --> 18:26.314
And who proved the same energy source
existed in humans and every life form?

18:26.823 --> 18:30.322
You. You made it possible
to harness that energy...

18:30.535 --> 18:32.492
...for ovo-pacs, scanners,
even the barrier.

18:32.703 --> 18:35.600
The council knows that.
They trust you doctor.

18:35.601 --> 18:37.449
We're so close to proving it.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.314
But we still need this part.
And this one here.

18:40.315 --> 18:43.128
Exactly two more pieces
and we've solved the puzzle!

18:43.339 --> 18:45.664
And we need to be free
to find those pieces.

18:45.883 --> 18:48.005
I want to show you something Aki.

18:49.553 --> 18:51.510
- What is this?
- Read.

18:51.721 --> 18:55.422
"All life is born of Gaia
and each life has a spirit.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.684
Each new spirit is housed in a physical body. "

18:58.937 --> 18:59.968
- Doctor?
- Go on.

19:00.188 --> 19:04.600
"Through their experiences on Earth,
each spirit matures and grows.

19:04.859 --> 19:07.314
When the physical body dies...

19:07.570 --> 19:12.362
...the mature spirit, enriched by
its life on Earth, returns to Gaia...

19:12.616 --> 19:15.285
...bringing with it the experiences...

19:16.286 --> 19:18.196
...enabling Gaia to live and grow. "

19:18.413 --> 19:19.956
It's my old diary.

19:20.415 --> 19:24.116
I wrote that 43 years ago,
when I was the age you are now.

19:26.630 --> 19:27.709
Dr. Sid!

19:27.922 --> 19:31.706
Remember what happened to Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...

19:31.926 --> 19:34.962
...he said the Earth was not
the center of the universe.

19:35.179 --> 19:37.172
That could happen to us.

19:37.390 --> 19:40.177
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.

19:40.393 --> 19:43.559
If you have any notes or records
that could be used against you...

19:43.771 --> 19:45.099
...destroy them.

19:45.564 --> 19:48.435
- Keep them up here.
- Right.

19:48.650 --> 19:51.437
And stay away from your friend, the captain.

19:51.653 --> 19:55.152
He saves your life, you save his life,
this leads to that.

19:55.407 --> 19:56.865
I was young once too, you know.

19:57.075 --> 19:59.992
Doctor, there is a war going on.

20:00.412 --> 20:02.867
No one's young anymore.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.639
Ladies and gentlemen of the council...

21:07.100 --> 21:09.176
...could you please explain why?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.850
Zeus was completed a month ago.

21:12.730 --> 21:16.977
If we attack the meteor with this, we will
eliminate the Phantoms at their source.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.936
General Hein, calm down.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.146
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...

21:21.363 --> 21:24.814
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon
to attack the Leonid Meteor.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.328
We have re-convened today to vote
on that very issue again.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.949
Now, I'd like to ask the director
of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.538
- Dr. Sid, please.
- Thank you.

21:36.711 --> 21:39.831
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest
is in the Leonid Meteor...

21:40.048 --> 21:42.539
...that landed here 34 years ago.

21:42.925 --> 21:47.504
What you see now are the records
of every assault on the meteor to date.

21:47.722 --> 21:51.505
Physical attacks have had
utterly no effect.

21:51.767 --> 21:55.717
This scene took place three months ago
during a full-scale bombardment.

21:56.188 --> 22:00.055
Now please note the Phantoms outside
the meteor are indeed destroyed.

22:00.359 --> 22:04.142
However, inside, many that
were dormant come to life...

22:04.362 --> 22:08.739
...and as you see,
overall Phantom density remains the same.

22:08.992 --> 22:11.696
The newly risen aliens
respond to the attack...

22:11.953 --> 22:14.658
...by burrowing even
deeper into the Earth.

22:14.872 --> 22:17.542
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...

22:17.750 --> 22:20.834
...because we see
the same thing during surgery...

22:21.045 --> 22:25.541
...when using bio-etheric lasers
on Phantom particles, do we not?

22:25.924 --> 22:27.253
Yes, indeed we do.

22:27.468 --> 22:30.005
You see. the injured particles escape...

22:30.220 --> 22:33.387
...burying or digging themselves deeper
into a patient's body.

22:33.598 --> 22:38.509
And when we increase the laser power
to destroy these deeper particles...

22:38.895 --> 22:42.845
...we have had incidents resulting in
further injury to a patient...

22:43.066 --> 22:44.892
...and in some cases...

22:45.109 --> 22:46.224
...death.

22:46.652 --> 22:48.526
And what exactly does that mean doctor?

22:48.779 --> 22:51.187
It means there's a very good chance...

22:51.407 --> 22:54.657
...the beam from the Zeus cannon
will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.

22:54.952 --> 22:56.031
Exactly! Thank you.

22:56.245 --> 23:00.907
However, it also means that
the beam energy may be too strong...

23:01.166 --> 23:02.577
...injuring the Earth.

23:02.793 --> 23:04.785
Injure the Earth?

23:05.170 --> 23:07.079
You mean the Gaia.

23:07.297 --> 23:10.251
- I mean...
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.

23:11.968 --> 23:15.586
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.091
Did he say what I think he said?

23:18.307 --> 23:19.422
What are you doing?

23:19.642 --> 23:22.559
I know what I'm doing and
whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.

23:22.770 --> 23:23.968
This is ridiculous.

23:24.271 --> 23:26.098
Doctor, with all due respect...

23:26.315 --> 23:29.565
...did you come here just to talk
about some Gaia theory?

23:29.777 --> 23:32.446
To tell us that the planet is alive?

23:32.654 --> 23:34.232
That it has a spirit?

23:34.489 --> 23:37.241
That's a fairy tale doctor and I'm sorry,
but we don't have time for that.

23:37.451 --> 23:40.155
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.

23:41.705 --> 23:45.702
Ahh.. Oh.. So if I point a gun
at the Earth and fire...

23:46.000 --> 23:49.665
...I'm not just making a hole on the ground,
I'm killing the planet.

23:49.879 --> 23:52.002
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory
has not been proven.

23:52.215 --> 23:57.042
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we
still have to remove the Phantoms?

23:57.303 --> 24:00.469
I think if there's any chance of success,
we should take it.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.804
- Don't you agree?
- Well, of course i do.

24:03.017 --> 24:05.472
But there is an alternative
to the space cannon.

24:05.686 --> 24:06.800
Another method?

24:07.020 --> 24:10.472
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms.
- Please.

24:11.733 --> 24:15.813
As we know, the aliens display
a distinct energy pattern.

24:16.738 --> 24:20.189
Now, it is a fact that
two opposing bio-etheric waves...

24:20.450 --> 24:22.941
...placed one over the other
will cancel each other out.

24:23.161 --> 24:26.446
It is theoretically possible
to construct a wave pattern...

24:26.706 --> 24:28.782
...in direct opposition
to the Phantom energy.

24:28.999 --> 24:32.166
We are currently assembling such
a wave and are nearing completion.

24:32.378 --> 24:34.002
Members of the council...

24:34.213 --> 24:37.379
...gathering plants and animals...

24:37.591 --> 24:41.007
...from around the world to fight
the Phantoms is utter nonsense.

24:41.678 --> 24:45.177
The Zeus cannon is a proven,
effective weapon.

24:45.432 --> 24:48.101
It will kill Phantoms.

24:48.435 --> 24:51.305
Can we afford to wait
for some crazy invention...

24:51.521 --> 24:55.814
...some army of
touchy-feely plants and animals...

24:56.067 --> 24:59.021
...An invention that offers no solid evidence
that it will destroy the aliens?

24:59.236 --> 25:00.399
There is evidence!

25:00.613 --> 25:02.901
Our partially completed energy wave...

25:03.157 --> 25:05.730
...has successfully stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...

25:05.951 --> 25:08.407
...through a terminally-infected patient.

25:08.745 --> 25:11.782
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence
that a terminal patient has been cured?

25:12.040 --> 25:15.160
Not cured. The wave is not complete.

25:15.377 --> 25:19.920
But we've succeeded in containing the
particles safely inside the patient.

25:20.715 --> 25:23.087
Where is the proof?

25:23.760 --> 25:24.922
Here.

25:38.774 --> 25:42.309
You may have bought us some time Aki,
but i wonder at what cost?

25:42.569 --> 25:45.855
Doctor, I can't keep hiding
in the background while you protect me.

25:46.323 --> 25:49.027
I want what life I have left
to mean something.

25:49.242 --> 25:52.693
Will you listen to me? When we find
the seventh and eighth spirits...

25:52.912 --> 25:55.866
If we find them.
What we need now is some luck.

25:56.082 --> 25:58.917
Luck has nothing to do with it.

25:59.127 --> 26:01.534
Faith and hard work, girl...

26:01.754 --> 26:05.253
...coz I'll be damned if
you're going to die before me.

26:33.367 --> 26:36.736
The council decided to postpone
firing the Zeus cannon.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.905
I guess I put on a good show.

26:39.123 --> 26:40.617
Mind if I tag along?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.790
You'll probably get bored.

26:55.638 --> 26:57.548
So, what are you doing?

27:00.393 --> 27:03.809
Oh, I see. You're giving me
the silent treatment.

27:04.188 --> 27:07.355
I'm scanning the city
for the seventh spirit.

27:19.494 --> 27:20.526
Hurry up, Neil.

27:20.787 --> 27:23.112
- Relax sergeant. Almost got it.
- What do you think you're doing?

27:23.331 --> 27:25.573
We're just gonna strand them for a while.

27:26.376 --> 27:28.084
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.

27:28.294 --> 27:29.705
This was your idea?

27:29.921 --> 27:31.795
We're just helping the captain out a little.

27:32.006 --> 27:33.798
Yeah, come on Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?

27:34.008 --> 27:36.581
You've seen how
the captain looks at her.

27:40.723 --> 27:42.550
It's amore, baby.

27:44.101 --> 27:45.809
What's going on?

27:46.020 --> 27:47.727
It's probably just a glitch.

27:48.439 --> 27:51.605
- Listen, Aki...
- I'm still mad at you.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.893
- You're mad at me?
- Leaving your helmet on.

27:54.152 --> 27:57.355
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?

27:57.572 --> 28:01.819
Hey! Well, I was just a little upset when you just packed
up and left for the Zeus Station without saying a word.

28:02.035 --> 28:05.119
- Well, now you know what was going on. Alright?
- Yeah. Now I know.

28:05.371 --> 28:07.696
My operation had to be done
in zero grav. Okay?

28:07.915 --> 28:08.947
Fine.

28:09.292 --> 28:12.209
And how about the fact that I was sent there
on a job and you wouldn't even see me.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.875
I was probably helping Dr. Sid
collect spirit waves.

28:15.089 --> 28:16.547
- Well, now I know.
- So I'm sorry!

28:16.757 --> 28:19.426
Well, me too! So we're both sorry.

28:26.058 --> 28:27.931
So will you tell me about them?

28:28.143 --> 28:29.720
About what?

28:29.936 --> 28:32.225
About the spirits you've collected.

28:33.231 --> 28:36.730
I was infected by a Phantom
during an experiment.

28:36.943 --> 28:40.276
- Normally, no one could have survived.
- How did you?

28:40.488 --> 28:44.532
Dr. Sid created a membrane around
the infection, keeping me alive.

28:44.742 --> 28:47.315
So the first spirit wave was me.

28:47.536 --> 28:50.205
- The second was a fish.
- A fish?

28:50.456 --> 28:54.405
The third was a deer I found
in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.

28:55.127 --> 28:56.751
The fourth was a bird.

28:56.962 --> 29:01.042
Ever tried to track a sparrow
from outer space? It's no fun.

29:01.258 --> 29:04.009
- What am I saying? You probably would love that.
- You're right. I probably would.

29:04.219 --> 29:07.385
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.

29:07.597 --> 29:09.388
- I thought that was number six.
- What?

29:09.599 --> 29:11.010
You skipped one.

29:13.936 --> 29:18.847
The fifth was a little girl dying
in a hospital emergency room.

29:19.316 --> 29:22.602
I retrieved the sample
in time, but she...

29:24.655 --> 29:29.779
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.619
Even the Earth.

29:32.162 --> 29:35.946
I told her that she wasn't dying
just returning to the Earth's spirit...

29:36.166 --> 29:37.660
...to Gaia.

29:40.545 --> 29:44.459
She told me that she was ready to die.

29:47.885 --> 29:52.346
She said I didn't have to make up
stories to make her feel better.

29:55.976 --> 29:58.514
Only 7 years old and ready to die.

29:58.979 --> 30:00.354
I'm sorry.

30:01.565 --> 30:05.977
I have work to do. I have to find
the seventh and eighth spirits.

30:06.194 --> 30:08.863
Don't, please.

30:09.322 --> 30:11.943
You don't believe any of this, do you?

30:12.158 --> 30:14.364
I just don't know, Aki.

30:19.540 --> 30:21.698
Is this why you shut me out?

30:21.917 --> 30:23.709
You should have told me.

30:24.587 --> 30:27.706
I don't know how much time I have left.

30:28.674 --> 30:29.919
Who does?

30:35.347 --> 30:37.885
I better get back to scanning.

30:53.572 --> 30:54.853
Captain Edwards...

30:55.574 --> 30:59.868
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago did you not?

31:00.079 --> 31:03.364
- Yes, sir.
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?

31:03.707 --> 31:07.040
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.

31:07.252 --> 31:11.036
You and the Deep Eyes are being
temporarily reassigned.

31:11.589 --> 31:14.839
You will guard Dr. Ross
when she reenters the wasteland.

31:15.009 --> 31:18.378
- Understood, sir.
- You don't understand yet, captain.

31:18.763 --> 31:22.926
Report any aberrant behavior
in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.387
Aberrant behavior sir?

31:24.602 --> 31:29.762
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain.
We don't know what it may be doing to her.

31:29.982 --> 31:32.389
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.

31:32.609 --> 31:35.610
They may be manipulating the doctor
for their very own purposes.

31:35.904 --> 31:39.818
Is the general suggesting
that Dr. Ross is a spy?

31:40.283 --> 31:44.447
The general is wondering why
he's explaining himself to a captain.

31:44.746 --> 31:47.581
She's had prolonged exposure
to Phantom tissue.

31:47.874 --> 31:50.495
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...

31:50.710 --> 31:55.502
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest
and transported here for observation.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.967
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.298
Of course, sir.

32:09.353 --> 32:13.813
Major, send some of our men
to keep an eye on the good captain.

33:49.281 --> 33:52.946
I'm convinced that these dreams
are some form of communication.

33:53.159 --> 33:55.152
Their message still eludes me...

33:55.370 --> 33:59.830
...but they're coming faster now
and that can only mean one thing.

34:00.291 --> 34:03.245
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.

34:03.461 --> 34:06.580
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.

34:07.298 --> 34:08.329
- Roger.
- Phantom concentration?

34:08.549 --> 34:10.956
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.

34:11.176 --> 34:13.003
So it's gonna be a real picnic.

34:13.219 --> 34:17.004
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay?
Everything by the book.

34:17.224 --> 34:19.050
By the book. Right.

34:25.648 --> 34:29.148
If we drop energy buoys here,
here and here...

34:29.402 --> 34:31.193
...we should be able to
land, acquire the target,

34:31.194 --> 34:33.234
and get out before the Phantoms
even know we were there.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.523
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.697
- Yeah.
- For a while.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.371
So you're from the 307th's right?
Under General Hein?

34:50.589 --> 34:54.717
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.

35:21.326 --> 35:26.700
Captain, rendezvous for evac at
vector 6, coordinate 279.

35:27.791 --> 35:30.364
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.

35:48.644 --> 35:50.885
Looks like they've taken the bait.

36:06.452 --> 36:09.619
The seventh spirit should be
just beyond that line of wreckage.

36:09.830 --> 36:12.701
I don't see how any living thing
could survive out here?

36:12.917 --> 36:15.158
We'll find out soon enough.

36:16.921 --> 36:19.672
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.

36:19.923 --> 36:22.414
It was supposed to end the war.

36:25.012 --> 36:27.585
My father's in here somewhere.

36:30.642 --> 36:31.721
All right.

36:32.394 --> 36:34.185
Let's move out, people.

36:50.369 --> 36:51.614
I'll be damned.

36:51.829 --> 36:52.908
A survivor.

36:54.206 --> 36:55.700
What's it doing out here?

36:55.916 --> 36:57.789
Hoping for life to return.

36:59.252 --> 37:00.996
Is that our spirit, doc?

37:02.964 --> 37:03.995
No.

37:18.187 --> 37:19.895
We're closing in on the life form.

37:20.105 --> 37:24.055
- Distance?
- Hard to say. We're very close.

37:24.568 --> 37:26.607
I don't see anything.

37:32.033 --> 37:35.533
- You're not gonna tell me it's him?
- That's impossible.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.711
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.

37:45.922 --> 37:49.836
How do you explain that? The pacs power
our weapons, the barrier cities...

37:50.050 --> 37:51.794
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.

37:52.011 --> 37:55.426
And to create that energy we use
living tissue. Single-cell organisms.

37:55.639 --> 37:58.426
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit?
- Yes.

37:58.642 --> 38:00.516
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?

38:00.727 --> 38:01.842
- Captain?
- What? Say again?

38:02.104 --> 38:03.930
You read me captain? We have incoming.

38:04.189 --> 38:06.063
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.

38:23.582 --> 38:25.824
I need a hand! Sarge!

38:30.005 --> 38:33.089
- Those buoys? They're not working.
- Yeah.

38:36.011 --> 38:38.798
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.763
Let's get the hell out of here!

38:44.435 --> 38:46.475
Something's not right.
This shouldn't be happening.

38:46.687 --> 38:48.976
Something's attracting them.

38:49.982 --> 38:51.061
Aki!

38:55.529 --> 38:59.479
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast!
- Jane, take the lead.

39:14.214 --> 39:15.494
Fire in the hole!

39:28.185 --> 39:29.928
Get us out of here, Neil.

39:30.521 --> 39:32.597
- Sir, I would love to, but...
- Just do it!

39:58.589 --> 39:59.869
- Sir?
- It's okay, that's it.

40:01.508 --> 40:03.252
That doesn't look good, captain.

40:03.886 --> 40:05.677
We have to get her to a hospital.

40:05.888 --> 40:09.506
- You have your orders, sir.
- What the hell is going on here?

40:09.725 --> 40:13.473
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.

40:17.732 --> 40:19.725
Lower your weapons. That's an order!

40:19.943 --> 40:21.900
Sir. We have no choice,
but to relieve you of your command.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.644
I won't let you do this soldier.
You'll gonna have to shoot me.

40:24.906 --> 40:26.483
Stand down, captain!

41:50.362 --> 41:52.438
Hang on, everyone!

41:57.160 --> 42:01.240
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!

42:11.965 --> 42:13.507
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!

42:25.311 --> 42:27.600
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!

42:38.491 --> 42:41.491
The Deep Eyes are returning
from the wasteland, sir.

42:41.702 --> 42:43.279
Apparently, there was an incident.

42:43.579 --> 42:46.366
It would seem the Phantoms
were attracted to Dr. Ross.

42:46.623 --> 42:49.826
The crew barely escaped with their lives.

42:50.043 --> 42:52.534
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.

42:52.754 --> 42:54.248
Issue an order.

42:54.464 --> 42:57.418
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross
placed under arrest.

42:57.634 --> 43:00.919
All research materials pertaining
to Dr. Sid's wave theory...

43:01.137 --> 43:02.761
...are to be confiscated immediately.

43:02.972 --> 43:05.889
That might not go over
too well with the council, sir.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.508
What a tragedy that would be.

43:08.728 --> 43:13.021
This is perfect, major.
The good captain has opened the door for us.

43:13.816 --> 43:16.223
By tomorrow morning,
the council will be at our feet...

43:16.443 --> 43:19.859
...thanking us for exposing
the traitors and imploring us...

43:20.072 --> 43:22.194
...to save them from the Phantoms.

43:26.870 --> 43:28.447
How is she, doctor?

43:29.247 --> 43:32.698
- She is dying.
- There must be something you can do.

43:33.001 --> 43:35.289
Aki is fighting with
only six of the eight spirits.

43:35.503 --> 43:38.587
We'll have to implant the seventh
directly into her chest plate.

43:38.798 --> 43:41.253
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damaged.

43:41.717 --> 43:43.626
We have to repair this panel quickly.

43:44.720 --> 43:49.382
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.

43:50.100 --> 43:54.643
She needs a sympathetic spirit
to help hold her in this world.

43:54.855 --> 43:59.516
And I can think of no spirit better suited
for that task than yours, captain.

43:59.776 --> 44:03.476
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to understand.

44:03.947 --> 44:05.904
You just be with her now.

44:07.033 --> 44:09.109
You keep her here with us.

45:01.209 --> 45:03.534
Aki? Where are we?

45:03.753 --> 45:05.627
On an alien planet.

45:05.839 --> 45:07.463
How is that possible?

45:09.092 --> 45:11.250
I'm not entirely sure.

45:11.469 --> 45:12.963
You seem pretty calm.

45:13.179 --> 45:16.429
I've been having this dream
every night for months.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.672
Dream?

45:18.267 --> 45:20.390
Well, whatever it is.

45:22.312 --> 45:24.803
You're really here, aren't you?

45:26.733 --> 45:27.978
What's happening to me?

45:28.276 --> 45:33.022
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit
directly into your body.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.944
Then you're my spiritual support.

45:36.159 --> 45:38.864
Gray, how sweet of you.

45:39.204 --> 45:43.450
Look, I don't think you realize
how serious this situation is.

45:46.711 --> 45:49.202
Something you should see here, sir.

45:56.929 --> 45:59.170
And I am watching what, major?

45:59.389 --> 46:02.840
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.

46:03.059 --> 46:05.633
And why would I be interested in...

46:07.063 --> 46:08.308
...her dreams?

46:08.773 --> 46:10.979
This is it. This is our evidence.

46:11.192 --> 46:13.979
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.

46:18.574 --> 46:23.070
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs
to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.

46:23.287 --> 46:26.656
The council is content to hide
powering inside this barrier...

46:26.874 --> 46:29.412
...while the world dies a little more every day.

46:29.626 --> 46:32.413
I believe they need a push
in the right direction, major.

46:32.629 --> 46:35.381
Get together a group of your most trusted men.

47:27.223 --> 47:29.345
What are they doing.
Why are they staring at us?

47:29.558 --> 47:31.100
Not at us.

48:21.691 --> 48:23.648
Welcome back, captain.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.602
Is it over?

48:28.531 --> 48:30.191
How is she, doctor?

48:30.407 --> 48:32.614
She's gonna be fine.
But this is only temporary.

48:32.868 --> 48:36.403
We'll need to find the eighth
and final spirit to cure her.

48:39.541 --> 48:42.032
Aki, can you hear me?

48:44.379 --> 48:46.003
I finished it.

48:46.214 --> 48:48.041
I know what it means.

48:48.258 --> 48:51.009
I know what the Phantoms really are.

48:52.220 --> 48:55.505
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!

49:06.442 --> 49:07.852
We have them, sir.

49:09.153 --> 49:10.232
Sir?

49:10.779 --> 49:12.985
My wife and daughter...

49:15.158 --> 49:19.820
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.

49:20.038 --> 49:21.995
Did I ever tell you that?

49:24.500 --> 49:28.284
I try to imagine what..
what that must have been like...

49:28.504 --> 49:32.751
...seeing everyone around you
fall over dead for no apparent reason.

49:34.009 --> 49:37.959
And then, at the end,
feeling something next to you...

49:38.389 --> 49:39.669
...invisible...

49:40.432 --> 49:41.761
...touching you...

49:42.976 --> 49:45.514
...reaching inside your body...

49:47.898 --> 49:50.056
You've lost family, haven't you?

49:50.525 --> 49:51.723
Yes, sir.

49:52.235 --> 49:54.228
That's why I trust you.

49:55.238 --> 49:56.518
All of you.

49:56.864 --> 49:59.569
You know what must be done.

50:06.999 --> 50:09.241
Security override.

50:09.543 --> 50:12.212
Perimeter breached.

50:13.755 --> 50:16.044
Major, arrest these men.

50:16.633 --> 50:19.634
- Take it easy.
- Stand up. Go.

50:19.845 --> 50:23.593
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask any questions.

50:25.475 --> 50:27.218
Reduce power to Sector 31.

50:27.435 --> 50:29.428
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...

50:29.687 --> 50:31.062
What I realize, major...

50:31.272 --> 50:35.222
...is that we must force the council
to take action against the enemy.

50:41.699 --> 50:44.949
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.

50:45.744 --> 50:48.661
Lowering power output to Sector 31.

50:49.790 --> 50:52.909
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general.
They're coming through now.

50:53.084 --> 50:56.287
Oh I think we can easily handle
a few Phantoms in a contained space.

50:57.255 --> 51:02.166
Relax, major. When this night's over,
you're going to be a hero.

51:04.470 --> 51:07.554
- Aki, I don't think...
- You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.137
That's just it. I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?

51:10.392 --> 51:12.718
Captain, please, let her continue.

51:12.937 --> 51:16.720
Alright. Why do you think
we've never been able to determine...

51:16.940 --> 51:21.104
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms
and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?

51:21.528 --> 51:25.063
Excuse me, doc,
but what friggin' relationship?

51:25.282 --> 51:29.742
I mean you got your human-sized Phantoms,
and your creepy caterpillary Phantoms...

51:29.953 --> 51:32.526
...and your flying Phantoms
and let's not forget my personal favorite...

51:32.747 --> 51:34.371
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.

51:34.707 --> 51:35.738
Down, boy.

51:35.917 --> 51:38.538
He's right. If you've spent as much time
in the field as we had...

51:38.753 --> 51:42.252
...you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.

51:42.465 --> 51:46.129
Precisely. I think the giant ones are
like our whales or elephants.

51:46.343 --> 51:50.637
But why would an invading army bring
a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?

51:50.889 --> 51:53.641
Unless their ship was kind of
a crazy Noah's Ark?

51:54.226 --> 51:56.633
We have always assumed that the meteor...

51:56.853 --> 52:00.020
...was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn't.

52:00.690 --> 52:03.525
The meteor is a chunk of their planet
that got thrown into space...

52:03.735 --> 52:04.933
...when they destroyed their world.

52:05.153 --> 52:09.613
But how could they survive the trip
across outer space on a hunk of rock?

52:09.824 --> 52:11.318
They didn't.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.742
Oh. This is all beginning to
make a creepy kind of sense.

52:17.998 --> 52:19.457
What do you think about all this, captain?

52:20.000 --> 52:23.665
I think that explains why we never had a chance.

52:23.962 --> 52:27.497
All our strategies are based on one assumption:

52:27.757 --> 52:30.675
That we were fighting alien invaders.

52:30.885 --> 52:33.720
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.

52:33.930 --> 52:36.765
Since then, all they've known is suffering.

52:36.975 --> 52:38.848
They're not an invading army.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.768
They're ghosts.

52:42.605 --> 52:43.850
How many Phantoms?

52:44.106 --> 52:45.898
More than enough to convince the council, sir.

52:46.150 --> 52:49.522
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send
a squad out to eliminate them.

52:49.523 --> 52:50.444
Yes sir.

52:50.696 --> 52:53.234
Alert status. Full deployment.

52:53.490 --> 52:55.233
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!

52:55.450 --> 52:56.909
Well, of course you do.

52:57.119 --> 52:59.954
Outside of Sector 31, sir.
And moving at incredible speed.

53:00.163 --> 53:01.954
Major, What the hell is going on here?

53:02.165 --> 53:03.540
They're in the pipes.

53:03.750 --> 53:06.323
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.

53:06.544 --> 53:10.458
That's impossible. No living thing
could survive in those pipes.

53:10.923 --> 53:14.968
Well, we've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.

53:22.351 --> 53:23.726
Oh, my God.

53:24.436 --> 53:25.765
Hold your fire!

54:12.440 --> 54:14.064
What have I done?

54:35.212 --> 54:39.505
Come on, Neil. We need to find a way out.
You're our man. Think.

54:39.716 --> 54:43.583
Captain, these walls are titanium alloy
and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.

54:43.803 --> 54:47.219
I mean it's not like I can just
wave a magic wand and...

54:50.268 --> 54:53.019
- Wow! Neil, I'm impressed.
- That makes two of us.

54:53.229 --> 54:56.313
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.

54:56.941 --> 54:58.980
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.

54:59.193 --> 55:02.608
I think we should proceed
to the nearest evacuation facility.

55:27.386 --> 55:30.007
- Here they come.
- But the others! Dr. Sid!

55:30.222 --> 55:32.511
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.
Come on.

55:39.981 --> 55:42.104
What's happening. Why can we see them now?

55:42.359 --> 55:45.692
They must be carrying a residual charge
from passing through the barrier.

55:50.616 --> 55:51.897
Behind you!

56:54.010 --> 56:55.587
All aboard, captain!

58:03.451 --> 58:04.482
We need to find my ship.

58:04.702 --> 58:07.371
If it was towed inside the city,
it would be in the military hangar.

58:07.580 --> 58:09.323
That's a big "if. "

58:18.298 --> 58:19.496
Look out!

58:27.432 --> 58:29.508
- Get us onto the platform.
- You got it.

58:47.451 --> 58:49.324
Okay, now what?

58:49.536 --> 58:51.327
We're going through the station.

58:51.538 --> 58:53.115
- What?
- Captain, with all due respect...

58:53.331 --> 58:55.371
- Excuse me, captain.
- The station.

58:55.583 --> 58:57.078
We're going through it.

58:57.335 --> 58:58.794
It's the only way.

58:59.170 --> 59:02.621
So I gather this will be
somewhat of a rough ride?

59:02.840 --> 59:05.378
Doc, you've got a talent for understatement.

59:05.593 --> 59:07.087
Hang on, everybody!

59:31.909 --> 59:32.941
Doc?

59:37.582 --> 59:38.744
Interesting.

59:39.333 --> 59:41.575
- Anybody hurt?
- Captain.

59:45.964 --> 59:48.420
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.

59:48.926 --> 59:49.957
Ouch!

59:50.177 --> 59:51.505
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- Right.

59:51.720 --> 59:55.800
No wait! We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.

59:56.016 --> 59:57.296
They're in my ship.

59:58.727 --> 01:00:02.178
- No. No, doc. No drugs.
- Captain?

01:00:02.397 --> 01:00:03.642
You heard the man.

01:00:04.357 --> 01:00:05.934
We'll find the ship and be back for you.

01:00:06.192 --> 01:00:07.935
- I'll stay with him.
- Me too.

01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:09.730
Nobody's staying.

01:00:10.946 --> 01:00:12.856
- Just give me a gun.
- You got it.

01:00:13.074 --> 01:00:15.611
Give him a weapon. Do it!

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.911
We'll be back for you, sergeant.

01:00:20.247 --> 01:00:21.326
You hear me?

01:00:21.623 --> 01:00:24.826
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.

01:00:25.335 --> 01:00:26.663
Let's move out.

01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:20.002
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.

01:01:20.262 --> 01:01:24.307
It can be used to retrieve Ryan
and transport him safely here.

01:01:24.516 --> 01:01:27.683
However, we'll need to replace
these spent fuel cells.

01:01:27.978 --> 01:01:30.647
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.

01:01:30.856 --> 01:01:33.809
Alright. Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.

01:01:34.025 --> 01:01:35.934
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.

01:01:36.152 --> 01:01:38.441
I'll go to the tower and rotate the airtray.

01:01:38.655 --> 01:01:43.316
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this thing and get the hell out of here.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.291
Gray, be careful.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:57.703
You too.

01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:41.250
Oh, yeah.

01:02:56.937 --> 01:02:58.431
Neil, do you read me?

01:02:58.689 --> 01:03:00.183
Loud and clear, captain.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.232
This baby'll fly itself.

01:03:09.824 --> 01:03:11.105
Flight path is set.

01:03:11.326 --> 01:03:12.784
Beginning rotation.

01:03:16.331 --> 01:03:18.537
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:21.323
I'm reading an impound tractor
attached probably to the ship.

01:03:21.544 --> 01:03:23.786
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?

01:03:24.004 --> 01:03:26.875
No sir. Permission to go outside
and detach the coupling.

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:28.629
Do it.

01:03:40.186 --> 01:03:41.681
There's the problem.

01:03:50.613 --> 01:03:53.104
The controls are locked, naturally.

01:03:56.035 --> 01:03:59.451
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we're gonna get out of here alive?

01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:01.496
I mean I wonder if anybody else has gotten out.

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.247
You think anyone's made it this far? Huh?

01:04:04.793 --> 01:04:07.710
You think this eighth-spirit stuff
is really gonna work against the Phantoms?

01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:10.127
I mean what if it's all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo?

01:04:12.342 --> 01:04:16.256
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

01:04:28.649 --> 01:04:30.392
What's happening down there?

01:04:30.651 --> 01:04:33.142
Nothing we can't handle.

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:48.166
- Neil, what's your status?
- Almost there.

01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:50.043
I want you two back inside.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:54.001
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating
with extreme prejudice.

01:04:54.215 --> 01:04:55.495
Talk to me, Jane.

01:04:57.051 --> 01:04:59.127
No problem here, captain.

01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:07.263
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:49.057
Jane, get out of there.

01:05:49.392 --> 01:05:52.512
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!

01:05:52.729 --> 01:05:54.686
Get the hell out of there!

01:06:22.007 --> 01:06:24.711
The shield is powered and ready.

01:06:24.926 --> 01:06:26.301
- Where are you going?
- To the cockpit.

01:06:26.511 --> 01:06:29.595
The ship is set on autopilot.
We're in countdown to liftoff.

01:06:29.847 --> 01:06:33.216
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!

01:06:57.081 --> 01:06:59.323
Over here, you son of a bitch!

01:08:26.124 --> 01:08:28.662
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?

01:08:28.877 --> 01:08:31.082
You and Sid are getting
out of here now.

01:08:31.296 --> 01:08:34.499
- No! We can't just leave everyone.
- Everyone's dead!

01:08:34.716 --> 01:08:38.630
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.055
Goodbye, Aki.

01:09:20.759 --> 01:09:22.835
Gray, come on!

01:11:27.087 --> 01:11:28.463
I just...

01:11:30.132 --> 01:11:33.417
I wish I could believe they were in a better place.

01:13:43.133 --> 01:13:45.007
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...

01:13:45.218 --> 01:13:48.005
...to include an area that
we had previously overlooked.

01:13:48.221 --> 01:13:50.012
The impact crater.

01:13:51.057 --> 01:13:53.097
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.

01:13:53.309 --> 01:13:54.934
Yes, really quite astonishing.

01:13:55.144 --> 01:13:57.470
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.

01:13:57.688 --> 01:13:58.803
Precisely.

01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:02.315
Which suggests that
the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.

01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:05.729
I can't explain it at the moment,
but once we get down there...

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:09.232
- ... you will understand...
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:12.534
Yes, I expected that's how
you would evaluate our chances.

01:14:12.786 --> 01:14:14.197
Well, am I wrong?

01:14:14.413 --> 01:14:15.741
No, I agree. We probably...

01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:19.201
...won't live long enough to extract
the eighth spirit from the crater.

01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.995
Then why should we even try it?

01:14:21.211 --> 01:14:23.287
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.

01:14:23.505 --> 01:14:25.296
If we can't bring the final spirit here...

01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:28.044
...we can go there and complete
the wave inside the crater.

01:14:28.259 --> 01:14:29.670
Yes, exactly.

01:14:29.886 --> 01:14:31.843
And how do we do that, exactly?

01:14:32.263 --> 01:14:34.137
I can construct a device that...

01:14:34.348 --> 01:14:38.642
...would attach to Aki's chest plate
to gather the eighth spirit and then...

01:14:39.812 --> 01:14:40.926
And then what?

01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:44.438
And then we wait
and see what happens.

01:14:45.108 --> 01:14:46.188
That's it?

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.777
- That's your plan? We wait and see what happens?
- Yes.

01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:54.366
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.

01:14:54.826 --> 01:14:56.450
We keep scanning the surface from orbit...

01:14:56.703 --> 01:14:59.120
- and maybe we'll find a
compatible spirit somewhere else.

01:14:59.121 --> 01:14:59.407
Aki?

01:15:00.957 --> 01:15:02.830
I say we go in.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:35.150
What caused the barrier
to fail, General Hein?

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.776
I'm afraid it was
only a matter of time...

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:42.196
...before the Phantoms developed
an immunity to our barriers.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:45.077
But I am relieved to see that you
and the rest of the council...

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:48.790
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:51.707
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:54.958
The council has reconsidered
your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.

01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:56.373
I see.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.966
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.

01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:02.252
And, general...

01:16:03.683 --> 01:16:05.841
...best of luck to us all.

01:16:08.854 --> 01:16:10.349
Prepare to fire the cannon.

01:16:10.606 --> 01:16:11.685
The target, sir?

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.192
The Phantom crater.

01:16:41.844 --> 01:16:46.173
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.

01:16:50.728 --> 01:16:52.435
Powering the shield.

01:16:55.399 --> 01:16:57.190
Okay, we're over the meteor.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.895
Do you have it in sight, doctor?

01:16:59.903 --> 01:17:02.441
There are so many of them.

01:17:04.365 --> 01:17:05.397
Wait.

01:17:05.617 --> 01:17:09.744
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit
moving along the crater's surface.

01:17:10.329 --> 01:17:13.449
All right. Now let's take a closer look.

01:17:53.662 --> 01:17:55.370
Ready to fire in three minutes.

01:17:55.581 --> 01:17:59.364
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:01.869
Counter-thrusters are engaged.

01:18:02.087 --> 01:18:04.922
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.

01:18:05.131 --> 01:18:08.915
We have something on radar
over the impact site, sir.

01:18:11.095 --> 01:18:12.424
It's her.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.795
Sir?

01:18:14.015 --> 01:18:16.506
Just a traitor under
the influence of the enemy.

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:18.469
Continue the countdown.

01:18:18.686 --> 01:18:21.687
We'll take them all out at the same time.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:29.064
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:31.816
Target locked.

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.743
Ready to fire on your command.

01:18:38.538 --> 01:18:41.159
It's a match! It's a perfect match!

01:18:41.374 --> 01:18:43.165
- Target scanners ready, sir.
- Fire.

01:19:18.117 --> 01:19:19.315
What was that?

01:19:19.535 --> 01:19:22.026
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.

01:19:22.246 --> 01:19:25.697
- Aki, Captain, are you all right?
- A little shaken. Stand by.

01:19:25.916 --> 01:19:30.412
Sid, the eighth spirit is not
on our scanner. Do you have it?

01:19:31.004 --> 01:19:32.664
The eighth spirit...

01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:35.126
...has been destroyed.

01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:39.668
- What are we going to do now?
- Nothing. This mission is over.

01:19:39.971 --> 01:19:41.763
- We have to get out of here.
- Incoming!

01:20:13.628 --> 01:20:15.336
What is that?

01:20:15.547 --> 01:20:18.880
If you're getting us out of here,
you better do it now.

01:20:30.769 --> 01:20:31.884
Hold on!

01:20:41.196 --> 01:20:43.188
I can't hold on to you.

01:20:47.786 --> 01:20:50.323
Unable to maintain altitude.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.957
Initiate emergency landing procedures.

01:21:23.736 --> 01:21:26.227
Come in. Come in, please.

01:21:26.447 --> 01:21:29.282
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

01:21:29.533 --> 01:21:33.483
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?

01:21:35.956 --> 01:21:38.874
- What is that thing?
- I don't know, sir.

01:21:39.126 --> 01:21:41.368
Incoming message, sir.

01:21:41.587 --> 01:21:44.077
General Hein,
You must cease fire immediately.

01:21:44.339 --> 01:21:48.633
What you are looking at in the crater is the
living spirit of an alien's home world.

01:21:48.843 --> 01:21:51.465
Their planet was destroyed
and part of it landed here.

01:21:51.679 --> 01:21:54.301
This is not an invasion. It never was.

01:21:54.557 --> 01:21:58.934
I see and what have we been fighting
all this time, doctor? Ghosts?

01:21:59.145 --> 01:22:03.771
Yes. Spirits that are confused,
lost and angry.

01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:06.687
Right. And these spirits are
coming out of this Gaia thing.

01:22:06.902 --> 01:22:08.527
General Hein, you have to listen.

01:22:08.779 --> 01:22:12.314
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...

01:22:12.616 --> 01:22:15.403
...the fact remains the Earth
is under attack from an aggressor...

01:22:15.577 --> 01:22:17.902
...who must be destroyed at all costs.

01:22:18.163 --> 01:22:20.654
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.

01:22:20.957 --> 01:22:23.744
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.

01:22:24.002 --> 01:22:28.331
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor,
I will take your protest to mean that we are...

01:22:28.548 --> 01:22:30.505
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.

01:22:30.716 --> 01:22:35.212
So i suggest you take your last few moments
and prepare to meet your Gaia.

01:22:35.346 --> 01:22:38.465
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.

01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:17.173
General, the system is overheating, sir.

01:23:17.386 --> 01:23:21.300
We're going to hit it again and again
and keep on hitting it until it's dead.

01:23:21.598 --> 01:23:24.136
But, sir. We're not even sure
if it's having any effect on the creature.

01:23:24.351 --> 01:23:27.719
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.

01:23:27.937 --> 01:23:32.017
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.

01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:35.981
- The system won't allow us to fire again.
- We'll see about that.

01:23:37.196 --> 01:23:41.028
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here.
Come on!

01:24:03.012 --> 01:24:05.254
This is not a good place to be.

01:24:13.647 --> 01:24:16.648
What the hell is that?
That's not what I think it is, Is it?

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.098
Yes, it's Gaia.

01:24:18.318 --> 01:24:20.892
This is definitely not a good place to be.

01:24:23.073 --> 01:24:24.188
Hey, are you all right?

01:24:24.408 --> 01:24:28.072
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

01:25:06.906 --> 01:25:09.444
Sid, do you read me?

01:25:10.118 --> 01:25:12.240
Go ahead, I'm still here.

01:25:12.536 --> 01:25:16.866
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.

01:25:17.082 --> 01:25:21.162
I think this explains why
the eighth spirit appeared here.

01:25:22.337 --> 01:25:23.417
Yes.

01:25:23.964 --> 01:25:25.707
Yes, that's it!

01:25:25.924 --> 01:25:28.795
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...

01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:31.680
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.

01:25:31.972 --> 01:25:35.222
If so, it would've been given
a different energy signature...

01:25:35.433 --> 01:25:38.434
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.

01:25:38.853 --> 01:25:41.889
You two could not have hoped
for a better location...

01:25:42.231 --> 01:25:44.271
...to find a new compatible spirit.

01:25:44.483 --> 01:25:48.861
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.

01:25:49.905 --> 01:25:53.737
Staying right where we are
may not be as easy as it sounds.

01:25:53.992 --> 01:25:56.151
Don't shoot any of them!

01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:59.157
You could very well destroy our last hope.

01:25:59.331 --> 01:26:02.415
And what do you suggest I do, doctor?
Ask them to play nice?

01:26:02.626 --> 01:26:06.754
Combat strategy is your area
of expertise, captain, not mine.

01:26:08.006 --> 01:26:10.497
I have a reading here in the fissure.
Do you see it?

01:26:10.758 --> 01:26:15.634
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.

01:26:15.805 --> 01:26:19.138
Well? Which one is it? Which one?

01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:23.134
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down.
Just a moment, please.

01:26:25.564 --> 01:26:29.348
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.

01:28:01.196 --> 01:28:03.438
With the hope of new life...

01:28:03.657 --> 01:28:06.693
...has Gaia changed
the Phantom within?

01:28:12.832 --> 01:28:14.113
I have it.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:23.127
Gray, get in here. I need you!

01:28:23.926 --> 01:28:26.962
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.

01:28:27.179 --> 01:28:30.429
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.

01:28:30.641 --> 01:28:33.511
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.

01:28:33.769 --> 01:28:36.141
It found me, doctor.

01:28:38.023 --> 01:28:39.647
Oh, my word.

01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:43.985
I see now. I understand.

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:46.817
Well, I don't understand!
What the hell is going on?

01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.024
Give me the ovo-pac.
I need to project the completed wave.

01:28:49.242 --> 01:28:52.492
- But we'll be defenseless.
- Just do it!

01:28:52.704 --> 01:28:54.580
I hope you know
what you're doing, Aki.

01:28:54.581 --> 01:28:57.081
- We can use the shield to project the wave.
- What?

01:28:57.291 --> 01:29:00.790
Dr. Sid's theory was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.

01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:02.378
I'm cured, Gray.

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:05.630
- Are you sure you have the final spirit?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:09.127
- But how? How can you know that?
- Don't worry. A Phantom told me.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:10.969
Oh, great.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.469
That's it. Shield on.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:22.271
It's not working.
We have to do something before it's too late.

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.608
If this doesn't work,
then it's already too late.

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:35.034
Gray, trust me.

01:29:59.934 --> 01:30:01.725
I'll blast you all to hell.

01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:11.026
Oh, no. No!

01:30:15.407 --> 01:30:16.652
Get down!

01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:32.171
- Warning. System overload.
- I know.

01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:35.252
- Warning. System overload.
- I know!

01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:42.673
But it must be done.

01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:26.421
Fire.

01:31:26.641 --> 01:31:28.349
Fire, damn you!

01:31:29.394 --> 01:31:30.508
Fire!

01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:50.925
Don't leave me, Gray.

01:32:52.139 --> 01:32:54.760
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.178
Looks like I was right.

01:32:57.561 --> 01:32:59.933
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

01:33:00.146 --> 01:33:02.056
I still have the wave.

01:33:02.273 --> 01:33:04.349
We can get through this.

01:33:09.155 --> 01:33:11.480
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're going to make it.

01:33:11.699 --> 01:33:13.857
We both know that isn't true.

01:33:27.297 --> 01:33:28.542
Help me.

01:33:38.975 --> 01:33:40.766
Listen to me.

01:33:40.977 --> 01:33:45.140
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.

01:33:45.356 --> 01:33:47.099
Gray, no. Please?

01:33:47.316 --> 01:33:50.566
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.

01:34:00.537 --> 01:34:02.197
Don't leave me, Gray.

01:34:02.455 --> 01:34:05.326
You've been trying to tell me that death isn't the end.

01:34:05.583 --> 01:34:10.459
Don't back out on me now that I finally believe.

01:34:22.308 --> 01:34:23.470
I love you.

01:36:12.996 --> 01:36:14.953
Oh, it's warm.
