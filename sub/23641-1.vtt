08:00.635 --> 08:05.805
<i>This land has a name today</i>
<i>and is marked on maps.</i>

08:05.975 --> 08:10.895
<i>But the names and the marks and the land</i>
<i>all had to be won.</i>

08:11.065 --> 08:14.525
<i>Won from nature and from primitive man.</i>

08:15.315 --> 08:20.825
<i>Five generations ago,</i>
<i>a mere 125 years back...</i>

08:20.985 --> 08:24.035
<i>... this land was known</i>
<i>only as the West.</i>

08:24.195 --> 08:27.575
<i>Known only to a handful of white men...</i>

08:27.745 --> 08:32.495
<i>... lonely trappers wandering its vastness</i>
<i>in search of beaver.</i>

08:32.664 --> 08:35.755
<i>They were known as mountain men,</i>
<i>a new breed.</i>

08:35.914 --> 08:40.845
<i>Men like Jim Bridger,</i>
<i>Franch√®re and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.</i>

08:41.005 --> 08:44.425
<i>More Indian than the Indians</i>
<i>in all but blood.</i>

08:44.595 --> 08:47.555
<i>They held to no law but their own...</i>

08:47.725 --> 08:53.315
<i>... drifted free as the clouds,</i>
<i>settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.</i>

08:53.475 --> 08:59.315
<i>Their mocassined feet and unshod horses</i>
<i>leaving no trace on the land.</i>

09:00.695 --> 09:03.525
<i>Like the Indians,</i>
<i>with whom they were at peace...</i>

09:03.695 --> 09:08.205
<i>... they wanted nothing beyond</i>
<i>what they found, and little of that.</i>

09:08.865 --> 09:12.875
<i>The mountains, the forests,</i>
<i>the harsh country...</i>

09:13.035 --> 09:16.545
<i>... were as unchanging to them</i>
<i>as the stars...</i>

09:16.705 --> 09:19.425
<i>... and just as unyielding.</i>

09:21.005 --> 09:25.135
<i>Far behind the mountains,</i>
<i>beyond the rolling plains...</i>

09:25.305 --> 09:31.015
<i>... they had left the people of the East,</i>
<i>people who were restless in another way.</i>

09:31.725 --> 09:35.065
<i>The kind who'd look at a mountain</i>
<i>and see a watershed...</i>

09:35.225 --> 09:37.525
<i>... look at a forest</i>
<i>and see lumber for houses...</i>

09:37.685 --> 09:40.395
<i>... look at a stony field and see a farm.</i>

09:40.565 --> 09:44.655
<i>Their faces and their instincts</i>
<i>had been turned to the West...</i>

09:44.825 --> 09:47.905
<i>... ever since Plymouth Rock</i>
<i>and Jamestown.</i>

09:48.075 --> 09:52.165
<i>The trapper's road was the trail</i>
<i>of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.</i>

09:52.325 --> 09:55.835
<i>But for whole families</i>
<i>chaffing to follow the sun...</i>

09:55.995 --> 09:58.545
<i>... there had to be broader ways.</i>

09:58.705 --> 10:03.255
<i>There were no roads into the wilderness,</i>
<i>only rivers.</i>

10:03.425 --> 10:06.465
<i>And they flowed in the wrong direction:</i>
<i>North or south.</i>

10:06.635 --> 10:09.765
<i>Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.</i>

10:10.175 --> 10:16.685
<i>Until one day, a new river took source</i>
<i>in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.</i>

10:17.145 --> 10:20.275
<i>He conceived of a river</i>
<i>that would go west.</i>

10:20.435 --> 10:25.775
<i>And in the way Americans have</i>
<i>of acting out their dreams, it came to be.</i>

10:25.945 --> 10:28.615
<i>The Erie Canal left the Hudson</i>
<i>above Albany...</i>

10:28.785 --> 10:32.245
<i>... and carried clear across</i>
<i>to the Great Lakes.</i>

10:32.615 --> 10:35.785
<i>People who yearned for virgin land</i>
<i>and a new life...</i>

10:35.955 --> 10:38.295
<i>... now had a highway to take them.</i>

10:38.455 --> 10:40.045
<i>And they moved along.</i>

10:40.205 --> 10:42.795
Pride of Utica now loading!

10:43.465 --> 10:47.175
<i>All aboard for the Pride of Utica!</i>

10:47.345 --> 10:50.975
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...

10:51.135 --> 10:53.515
...the Skoga family!

10:53.685 --> 10:55.685
All eight of them!

10:55.855 --> 11:00.395
<i>All aboard for the Pride of Utica!</i>

11:01.815 --> 11:04.695
Is the laddie's health
the reason you're heading west?

11:04.855 --> 11:05.985
Partly.

11:06.155 --> 11:09.155
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.

11:09.325 --> 11:12.825
I had me a farm where some years
I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks to the acre.

11:12.995 --> 11:15.495
Zebulon, you hadn't
ought to lie to the man like that.

11:15.665 --> 11:19.245
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul,
and I tell the truth as I see it.

11:19.495 --> 11:22.835
Now, I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.

11:23.005 --> 11:25.925
And then one morning,
I hauled the bucket up out of the well...

11:26.085 --> 11:28.965
...and so help me,
the bucket was full of rocks.

11:29.135 --> 11:30.175
Rocks.

11:30.345 --> 11:33.475
I just stood there right still
trying not to blaspheme.

11:33.675 --> 11:36.055
I said to myself,
"You've got a son that's ailing...

11:36.225 --> 11:38.805
...you've got a daughter
what won't take to herself a husband."

11:38.975 --> 11:41.185
- There she sits there, mooning as usual.
- Pa.

11:41.355 --> 11:44.195
You've got another who don't seem
quite right in the head.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.355
Lilith?

11:48.155 --> 11:50.025
Yes, Pa?

11:51.195 --> 11:53.075
Now, I'll remind you, sir.

11:53.245 --> 11:57.205
I'm still standing there
holding a bucket full of rocks...

11:57.365 --> 12:00.245
...and staring into a bleak old age.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.795
So I made me a vow
right then and there. I said:

12:02.955 --> 12:07.215
"If I can find a man with $500
who likes rocks...

12:07.375 --> 12:10.045
...then there's gonna be another fool
owning this farm."

12:10.215 --> 12:13.885
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...

12:14.055 --> 12:15.265
...and here I am.

12:15.425 --> 12:18.225
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.

12:18.395 --> 12:20.185
We had the best farm in the township.

12:20.355 --> 12:22.725
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.

12:22.895 --> 12:24.395
Oh, it was not.

12:24.565 --> 12:27.235
It was his itching foot
that brought us here.

12:27.395 --> 12:29.695
Heaven knows where we'll end up.

12:30.405 --> 12:34.245
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.575
- How do you do?
- Hello.

12:35.745 --> 12:39.455
I think they're already acquainted
with your daughters.

12:39.705 --> 12:43.085
- Be they single?
- Aye, single so far.

12:43.245 --> 12:46.545
Well, this Illinois country's beginning
to sound better to me.

12:46.715 --> 12:47.755
Lilith?

12:47.925 --> 12:51.215
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune
for these handsome lads.

12:51.385 --> 12:54.515
- Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
- Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...

12:54.675 --> 12:56.385
...this ain't the time.

12:56.555 --> 12:58.055
All right.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.265
All right.

13:04.105 --> 13:08.565
<i>A captain bold in Halifax</i>
<i>Who lived in country quarters</i>

13:08.735 --> 13:12.405
<i>Betrayed a maid who hanged herself</i>
<i>One morning in her garters...</i>

13:12.575 --> 13:13.865
Lilith.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.785
Now, you know better
than to sing a song like that.

13:16.945 --> 13:19.285
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle."

13:19.455 --> 13:21.245
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.

13:21.415 --> 13:24.455
They haven't had much learning
in the social graces.

13:24.625 --> 13:27.085
All right, give them
"A Home in the Meadow."

13:31.795 --> 13:34.305
Eve, come on, you too.

13:34.965 --> 13:36.515
That's it.

13:37.465 --> 13:39.135
Come on, join in.

13:40.635 --> 13:42.435
That's it.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.235
Come on.

13:53.815 --> 13:56.155
Stop.

14:10.005 --> 14:12.885
<i>Loading for the Flying Arrow!</i>

14:13.045 --> 14:17.005
<i>All aboard for the Flying Arrow!</i>

14:17.505 --> 14:20.555
- The Prescott family!
- Here we be. Come on.

14:20.725 --> 14:24.685
Alec Harvey and three sons!

14:24.855 --> 14:28.315
Jeffrey Rose and family!

14:58.885 --> 15:03.185
<i>But the canal was only the first step</i>
<i>toward the promised land.</i>

15:03.345 --> 15:06.555
<i>The next steps were longer and harder.</i>

15:07.185 --> 15:11.565
<i>Those who could raise the fare</i>
<i>went by steamboat to the end of the line.</i>

15:11.735 --> 15:15.195
<i>Others found a cheaper way</i>
<i>to head for Ohio, Illinois...</i>

15:15.355 --> 15:17.655
<i>... and the open spaces beyond.</i>

15:33.665 --> 15:37.085
Lilith. Lilith, listen to this:

15:37.255 --> 15:40.715
"Theirs was a poignant parting
in the forest.

15:40.885 --> 15:45.265
The handsome young backwoodsman
carved two hearts on a tree trunk...

15:45.435 --> 15:49.815
...then from ten paces, hurled a knife
at the junction of the two hearts."

15:49.975 --> 15:51.565
Junction. What's that?

15:52.775 --> 15:55.645
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:

15:55.815 --> 15:58.235
"His marksmanship was uncanny.

15:58.405 --> 16:03.945
Three times he hurled the knife on target.
'That was for luck,, he said the first time.

16:04.365 --> 16:07.995
'That was for love. Deep, divine love"
he said the second.

16:08.165 --> 16:14.125
And the third time, 'That was a prayer,
a plea for love undying."'

16:14.295 --> 16:15.965
Isn't that beautiful?

16:17.085 --> 16:19.795
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.135
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.

16:23.805 --> 16:25.635
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.

16:25.805 --> 16:29.515
You wanna to be a farm wife,
but you don't wanna marry a farmer.

16:29.685 --> 16:31.725
Neither do you.

16:31.895 --> 16:32.935
Of course not.

16:33.105 --> 16:35.525
I don't wanna have
nothing to do with farms.

16:35.685 --> 16:40.695
I want silk dresses and fine carriages
and a man to smell good.

16:40.865 --> 16:43.695
What I want's back East, not West.

16:43.865 --> 16:46.155
But I'll get there yet. You watch.

16:46.825 --> 16:49.325
You don't know what you want yet.

16:49.535 --> 16:52.665
It's the man that counts,
not where he lives.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.255
- Ready, now?
Ready.

17:37.085 --> 17:42.925
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.

18:03.565 --> 18:06.695
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.

18:06.865 --> 18:09.245
They say no honest man
travels this river at night.

18:09.405 --> 18:11.165
I can only see one man, Pa.

18:11.325 --> 18:14.535
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...

18:14.705 --> 18:16.335
...till they're ready to jump you.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.505
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.

18:26.925 --> 18:28.765
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.

18:29.845 --> 18:32.765
And keep your hands
where we can see them.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.785
Name's Linus Rawlings.

18:51.955 --> 18:54.625
I'm hungrier than sin
and real peaceful like.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.955
- What have you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.625
I said beaver pelts.

18:59.795 --> 19:03.755
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.

19:04.755 --> 19:07.845
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.

19:08.005 --> 19:09.845
There you are.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.095
That's real soft.

19:12.265 --> 19:13.515
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.055
Now, my apologies, sir.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.645
- We was afeared you might be a pirate.
- I ain't no pirate.

19:19.815 --> 19:22.855
Come on, let's have supper
and get acquainted.

19:23.355 --> 19:27.655
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that, ma'am.

19:41.835 --> 19:43.965
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.465
Is he the backwoodsman
you've been waiting for?

19:46.635 --> 19:50.505
More than likely he's got
a wife and six kids waiting for him.

20:15.865 --> 20:18.035
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.

20:18.205 --> 20:21.585
You've only had four plates.
I was beginning to think you didn't like it.

20:21.745 --> 20:25.875
Well, it don't pay to eat too much
on an empty stomach, ma'am.

20:26.045 --> 20:28.425
How come you're to be traveling
so late at night?

20:28.585 --> 20:30.715
Well, I'm kind of anxious
to get to Pittsburgh.

20:30.885 --> 20:34.215
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.

20:35.725 --> 20:37.975
Well, now, we've never seen
a mountain man before.

20:38.145 --> 20:41.685
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains
as high as they say?

20:41.855 --> 20:46.855
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...

20:47.025 --> 20:48.525
Uh...

20:48.695 --> 20:53.075
Well, you know,
that just ain't exactly true.

20:53.235 --> 20:55.155
Jim Bridger and me...

20:55.325 --> 21:00.415
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.

21:00.915 --> 21:04.705
And then, one day, we see this fella...

21:04.875 --> 21:09.175
...and he has a great big pair
of white wings...

21:09.335 --> 21:11.005
...and a harp in his hand.

21:11.845 --> 21:13.715
And I said to Jim...

21:13.885 --> 21:17.675
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way
that fella's looking at us."

21:17.845 --> 21:22.015
And Jim said he didn't care too much
for it neither...

21:22.185 --> 21:24.265
...so we both skedaddled down
out of there...

21:24.435 --> 21:28.445
...and to this day I ain't never had
a good look at the Rocky Mountains.

21:34.235 --> 21:36.325
- Well, I remember one time...
- Zebulon.

21:36.495 --> 21:39.705
- What?
- One liar at a time is enough.

21:41.495 --> 21:45.955
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.955
We'll be expecting you for breakfast.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.465
Oh, well, that's mighty hospitable,
Mr. Prescott...

21:50.625 --> 21:53.005
...but sometimes I wake up
and get the urge to move.

21:53.175 --> 21:55.425
I might be long gone by sunup,
but thank you.

21:55.595 --> 21:59.135
- I wanna thank all of you. Good night.
- Good night.

22:00.345 --> 22:05.315
- Strange fellas, these mountain men.
- Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.

22:24.835 --> 22:28.085
- By golly, that looks like my blanket.
- It is.

22:28.255 --> 22:31.715
Well, then, I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?

22:31.875 --> 22:33.835
Yours.

22:34.465 --> 22:38.925
I ain't ever saw a bed like that
since last time I come east.

22:39.305 --> 22:41.135
Why'd you do it?

22:41.305 --> 22:44.555
Ain't polite to ask a girl
why she done something for a man.

22:45.145 --> 22:47.855
No. Well, I reckon my manners
ain't much at that.

22:48.015 --> 22:51.565
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.

22:56.195 --> 22:58.235
Are them Indian girls pretty?

22:58.405 --> 23:02.245
Well, now, I reckon that all depends
on just how long a man has gone...

23:02.405 --> 23:04.495
...without seeing one.

23:05.375 --> 23:08.545
How long's it been
since you seen a white girl?

23:08.995 --> 23:11.505
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.

23:13.795 --> 23:15.795
How pretty do I look to you?

23:15.965 --> 23:17.675
But, ma'am...

23:18.005 --> 23:21.475
...ain't you just being a little bit forward?

23:21.635 --> 23:26.725
Well, you're headed upriver
and I'm headed down.

23:26.895 --> 23:29.645
There's no time
to get these questions answered.

23:32.235 --> 23:34.815
You dead sure you want them answered?

23:36.775 --> 23:38.525
Yes.

23:51.755 --> 23:53.415
Glory be.

23:55.045 --> 23:57.385
Ma'am, it seems like
you've been kissed before.

23:59.885 --> 24:02.095
I've never been kissed permanent before.

24:03.595 --> 24:05.885
By golly, you sure use surprising words.

24:06.055 --> 24:10.225
I never heard "permanent" mixed up
with a thing like a kiss before.

24:11.975 --> 24:14.355
I can still feel that kiss.

24:14.525 --> 24:16.855
- Can you?
- Well, you said something before...

24:17.025 --> 24:18.775
...that we had not forget:

24:18.945 --> 24:22.785
I'm heading upstream
and you're headed downstream.

24:23.115 --> 24:25.455
Lovers have parted before
and come together again.

24:25.615 --> 24:27.035
- Ma'am.
- Eve.

24:28.955 --> 24:33.165
Eve, I'm a sinful man.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.965
Deep, dark, sinful.

24:36.125 --> 24:40.135
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh
to be sinful again.

24:40.295 --> 24:42.095
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.

24:42.255 --> 24:44.975
I won't even remember
the fancy gals I dally with...

24:45.135 --> 24:48.015
...or the men I carve up
just out of pure cussedness...

24:48.185 --> 24:50.805
...any more than I'll remember you.

24:51.645 --> 24:56.275
Linus, I'm asking you.
Can you still feel that kiss?

24:56.435 --> 24:57.565
Eve...

24:59.605 --> 25:04.535
Eve, you make me feel like a man
standing on a narrow ledge...

25:04.695 --> 25:08.785
...coming face-to-face with a grizzly bear.

25:09.495 --> 25:14.125
There just ain't no ignoring the situation.

25:35.025 --> 25:37.355
Eve!

25:39.605 --> 25:42.275
Eve!

25:42.445 --> 25:44.695
- Eve! Where is she?
- Zeb, what's the matter?

25:44.865 --> 25:47.865
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.

25:48.035 --> 25:51.035
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.

25:51.365 --> 25:53.375
I knowed you were setting with him...

25:53.535 --> 25:56.545
...but I kept telling myself,
"At least she's looking at a man."

25:56.705 --> 26:00.465
Even a wisp of smoke like that
is better than...

26:02.545 --> 26:05.885
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?

26:07.015 --> 26:09.095
Now, tell me what that means.

26:10.225 --> 26:11.725
Nothing, Pa.

26:11.895 --> 26:14.055
What time did you come to bed?

26:14.395 --> 26:16.565
It was early, Pa.

26:16.895 --> 26:19.605
It wasn't. It was late.

26:19.775 --> 26:22.405
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.

26:22.565 --> 26:25.985
Is there anything for your ma and pa
to worry about?

26:26.525 --> 26:28.655
No, Pa, there ain't.

26:45.345 --> 26:47.135
He'll be back.

26:47.635 --> 26:49.175
I'll see him again.

26:49.345 --> 26:53.095
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.

26:53.265 --> 26:56.435
I don't care. I'll see him again.

26:56.855 --> 26:58.525
Look.

27:04.405 --> 27:10.075
- You got a growed man to do that?
- I did. Just like in the book.

27:10.245 --> 27:13.285
Did you get him to say them crazy words?

27:13.455 --> 27:16.575
I told you before, it ain't the words,
it's the sentiment.

27:17.665 --> 27:21.125
You mean, he didn't even giggle nor nothing
at such foolishness?

27:22.215 --> 27:25.425
He said it was a real solemn occasion.

27:25.585 --> 27:28.255
Like shooting the rapids without a paddle.

27:30.215 --> 27:34.095
No matter what he said, he did it just
to get rid of you so as he could clear out.

27:34.265 --> 27:36.395
You know that's so.

27:36.555 --> 27:40.395
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna
live like a squaw all your life?

27:40.565 --> 27:43.025
Go on, say anything you like...

27:43.185 --> 27:46.105
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.

27:46.275 --> 27:48.575
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.

27:49.325 --> 27:51.945
He ain't got a wife at all yet.

28:05.045 --> 28:06.795
Hey, Pierre!

28:06.965 --> 28:08.295
Someone's coming upriver.

28:23.275 --> 28:24.395
Customer.

28:33.285 --> 28:34.865
Trapper, seems like.

28:35.035 --> 28:38.915
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.

28:50.675 --> 28:52.305
Thirsty, mister?

28:52.465 --> 28:56.015
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.

28:59.225 --> 29:01.815
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.

29:01.975 --> 29:04.975
My name is Jeb Hawkins,
late colonel of the Alabama militia.

29:05.145 --> 29:06.685
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.

29:06.855 --> 29:07.895
Pittsburgh? Well.

29:08.065 --> 29:10.615
Looks like he's got
a whole canoe of furs, Pop.

29:10.775 --> 29:12.985
- Sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.

29:13.155 --> 29:16.745
One of our explorers gonna extend
our domain to the far shores of the Pacific.

29:16.905 --> 29:19.245
Well, nothing but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?

29:19.415 --> 29:21.995
- Right.
- No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.

29:22.165 --> 29:24.585
Nothing but the pure grain
and the sweet kiss of the malt.

29:24.745 --> 29:29.585
- Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.
- Oh, a real mountain man, huh?

29:29.755 --> 29:33.595
- I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
- Sure will.

29:54.445 --> 29:56.615
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.

29:56.785 --> 30:00.495
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose he
might know what that varmint is we got?

30:00.665 --> 30:03.285
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.795
Sir, we caught us
a cave-dwelling critter...

30:05.955 --> 30:08.045
...that no man in these parts
has seen before.

30:08.205 --> 30:11.465
You know, it'd be right satisfying
to having you tell us what it is.

30:11.795 --> 30:15.635
Well, I don't know too much
about cave-dwelling varmints.

30:15.805 --> 30:19.135
Just yonder. Take your jug.

30:19.635 --> 30:21.805
Well, I...

30:23.805 --> 30:25.815
I don't know.

30:42.575 --> 30:44.705
WOIt's right over here.

30:55.005 --> 30:57.175
You know any sweet-talking gals
in Pittsburgh?

30:57.345 --> 31:00.015
No, no. Nary a one, yet.

31:00.175 --> 31:02.515
Well, Pop and I are hoping
we'll vacation there.

31:02.685 --> 31:06.645
I'll be at the Duquesne House
if it ain't burned down.

31:06.805 --> 31:13.315
Hey, there, now, you pretty girl,
you sure you got a varmint in here?

31:13.525 --> 31:14.985
Now, you...

31:15.155 --> 31:16.775
WODo you hear him?
Huh?

31:16.945 --> 31:19.405
WOHe breathes loud and fierce.

31:19.575 --> 31:23.785
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
You keep him in there?

31:25.875 --> 31:28.375
You gotta look a little closer.

31:48.055 --> 31:49.895
Well, he seen the varmint, Pa.

31:50.065 --> 31:53.025
- Well done, daughter.
- I ain't so sure.

31:53.185 --> 31:56.565
He was hard muscled. I could feel
the blade just skitter along his ribs.

31:56.735 --> 31:58.865
Oh, you just need more practice,
that's all.

31:59.025 --> 32:01.405
It's a pity you ain't got the knack
your ma had.

32:01.575 --> 32:03.575
Lord rest her soul.

32:03.745 --> 32:05.915
All right, men, lay it on, men.

32:06.075 --> 32:09.035
Come on, come on.
We got more fish to fry.

32:09.205 --> 32:11.335
Down to the island.

33:08.095 --> 33:10.975
Tell Pa them settlers, rafts are coming.

33:35.415 --> 33:37.165
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?

33:37.335 --> 33:40.295
- Genuine Parisian accent, it says.
- How much is it?

33:40.465 --> 33:42.045
It's only 15 cents.

33:42.215 --> 33:44.135
Fifteen cents? Put it back.

33:44.305 --> 33:48.515
You're right, sir. Absolutely right.
You save the pennies and dollars will grow.

33:48.675 --> 33:50.305
Likely you've growed many a dollar.

33:50.475 --> 33:54.015
Mr. Bedloe, all my life I've been striving
to avoid becoming a millionaire.

33:54.185 --> 33:55.975
I think I've succeeded right well.

33:56.145 --> 33:58.775
I've got a little put away in the sock.
It'll stay there.

33:58.945 --> 34:01.315
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.

34:01.485 --> 34:04.025
Now, you, sir.
You look like a man of property.

34:04.195 --> 34:08.364
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say
you was worth, say, a thousand dollars.

34:08.534 --> 34:11.534
- Pretty close to the mark?
- Well, close, maybe.

35:07.175 --> 35:11.265
Colin, how much powder we got left?
- Don't be afraid, now, don't be afraid.

35:11.425 --> 35:13.185
Now, there's women and children here.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.605
You gents wouldn't want us to have
to start shooting, now, would you?

35:17.355 --> 35:18.855
Be of good cheer, folks.

35:19.025 --> 35:21.815
It's in our noble tradition
that we conquer the wilderness...

35:21.985 --> 35:24.405
...with nothing but our bare hands
and stout hearts.

35:24.565 --> 35:28.485
You can build new rafts and sally forth
in the spirit of your forefathers.

35:28.655 --> 35:30.865
Why, you pious old scoundrel.

35:31.745 --> 35:33.285
I'll see you burn.

35:41.125 --> 35:42.545
Americans can't be whipped.

35:44.795 --> 35:48.045
It's him.
I knew he'd come back. It's him.

36:44.525 --> 36:48.155
Now let us pray.

36:49.365 --> 36:51.445
O Lord...

36:52.485 --> 36:55.285
...we thank thee for our salvation.

36:55.445 --> 36:59.125
We commit the souls of our dead
to thy gentle keeping.

36:59.745 --> 37:02.495
We pray for a speedy recovery
of our wounded.

37:05.665 --> 37:08.255
And now another matter.

37:08.755 --> 37:10.845
O Lord...

37:11.215 --> 37:13.675
...without consulting with thee...

37:13.845 --> 37:19.225
...we have sent thy way some souls
whose evil ways passeth all understanding.

37:19.895 --> 37:22.815
We ask thee humbly to receive them.

37:23.605 --> 37:25.565
Whether you want them or not.

37:25.735 --> 37:27.235
Amen.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.085
Now, it'll be a job...

37:50.255 --> 37:53.595
...but I guess I can patch her up
good enough to get to Pittsburgh.

37:54.135 --> 37:55.925
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...

37:56.095 --> 37:59.185
...let's just not talk any more about it.

37:59.345 --> 38:02.765
Linus, I'm telling you,
you don't know your own mind.

38:02.935 --> 38:04.975
Well, maybe so, maybe not.

38:05.145 --> 38:08.565
You know, I ain't saying
that you haven't been on my mind some.

38:08.735 --> 38:10.235
I ain't saying that.

38:10.395 --> 38:13.735
But I still went to see the varmint
with that pirate girl.

38:13.905 --> 38:16.945
I'll always be
going to see the varmint, Eve.

38:17.115 --> 38:21.115
I just ain't cut out
to be a farmer or a husband.

38:22.285 --> 38:25.335
Linus, I ain't never bringing up
the subject again...

38:25.495 --> 38:27.295
...whether ever I see you or not.

38:27.455 --> 38:29.965
No, it's for the best.

38:30.375 --> 38:33.175
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.

38:33.335 --> 38:38.055
And I ain't said that to anybody
for a long time.

39:11.715 --> 39:14.835
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.

39:15.005 --> 39:16.345
Look. Look.

39:16.505 --> 39:18.425
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.

39:18.595 --> 39:20.975
Let's beach her on this side.

39:21.135 --> 39:23.475
Harvey!

39:24.055 --> 39:25.555
Rapids!

39:25.725 --> 39:28.185
Rapids ahead! Beach her!

39:28.355 --> 39:29.685
Beach her!

39:33.145 --> 39:35.195
Hold her steady.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.705
Rein!

39:43.035 --> 39:45.325
Pa, we're in the current!

39:48.955 --> 39:51.165
Get inside, Zeke.

39:51.335 --> 39:54.175
No, I don't wanna.

39:59.555 --> 40:02.095
Straighten her, Pa.

40:03.175 --> 40:05.055
Lilith!

40:24.535 --> 40:26.995
Hold it steady!

40:28.825 --> 40:31.125
I can't!

41:46.575 --> 41:49.495
Go on. Go on to help Pa.

41:49.665 --> 41:51.495
I'll get it.

42:06.965 --> 42:10.015
Lilith! Lilith!

42:44.715 --> 42:47.385
Lie down!

42:47.555 --> 42:49.305
Lie down!

43:25.295 --> 43:26.595
What happened?

43:26.755 --> 43:30.595
They took the wrong fork of the river
and they went over the falls.

43:30.765 --> 43:32.845
Did you happen to hear
the name of the family?

43:33.015 --> 43:36.645
Uh... Prescott, I think.
Something like that.

43:50.735 --> 43:52.825
As soon as they're buried decent...

43:52.995 --> 43:55.955
...I'm heading back East
on the first boat that comes along.

43:56.125 --> 44:00.165
And if you were in your right mind,
you would too.

44:29.315 --> 44:31.615
Oh, Linus.

45:55.735 --> 45:58.575
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?

46:18.345 --> 46:19.515
Eve, I...

46:21.435 --> 46:26.725
Eve, all the time I was paddling down here
I was thinking...

46:26.895 --> 46:30.775
...if I found you alive, I'd...

46:31.355 --> 46:34.695
Would you come
to Pittsburgh with me, Eve?

46:35.235 --> 46:37.445
Oh, Linus.

46:39.075 --> 46:41.285
I'm staying right here.

46:41.455 --> 46:44.455
I ain't moving a foot
one way or the other.

46:46.035 --> 46:48.415
Now, would you explain that a little?

46:50.415 --> 46:53.585
Ma and Pa,
they wanted a farm in the West...

46:53.755 --> 46:56.385
...and this is as far as they got.

46:57.305 --> 47:00.635
Seems to me this is where the Lord
wanted the farm to be.

47:00.805 --> 47:03.515
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt,
and winter's coming...

47:03.685 --> 47:06.105
There's no sense talking about it.
I'm gonna do it.

47:06.435 --> 47:08.815
Eve, you just ain't making much sense.

47:10.485 --> 47:14.485
Well, half the people that come West
don't make much sense, I reckon.

47:19.445 --> 47:21.115
All right.

47:21.575 --> 47:23.325
All right.

47:24.625 --> 47:28.245
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.

47:30.085 --> 47:34.505
I reckon I seen that varmint
for the last time.

48:20.385 --> 48:25.135
<i>The westward course was no smoother</i>
<i>than that of true love.</i>

48:25.305 --> 48:29.725
<i>Not only the hard hand of nature</i>
<i>was against it, but the impediment of war.</i>

48:29.895 --> 48:33.435
<i>Trouble over land</i>
<i>smoldered along the Mexican border.</i>

48:33.605 --> 48:38.235
<i>Not all Americans were for war, including</i>
<i>Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.</i>

48:38.405 --> 48:41.405
<i>But a war did break out,</i>
<i>and in the end...</i>

48:41.575 --> 48:45.405
<i>... vast new territories came into the Union</i>
<i>along with their rich Spanish names:</i>

48:45.575 --> 48:49.495
<i>Rio Grande, Santa Fe,</i>
<i>Albuquerque, El Paso.</i>

48:49.665 --> 48:52.625
<i>And most glittering of all, California...</i>

48:52.795 --> 48:57.505
<i>... named after a mythical island</i>
<i>of pearls and gold in a 15th-century novel.</i>

48:57.675 --> 49:00.505
<i>Here, in 1848...</i>

49:00.675 --> 49:04.215
<i>... at Sutter's Mill, a man found something</i>
<i>he wasn't even looking for...</i>

49:04.385 --> 49:05.845
<i>... at the bottom of a ditch.</i>

49:06.015 --> 49:09.145
<i>And the cry of his discovery was heard</i>
<i>clear across the continent...</i>

49:09.305 --> 49:11.055
<i>... in Boston, New York, Savannah...</i>

49:11.225 --> 49:14.735
<i>... and across the oceans</i>
<i>in London, Paris, Berlin.</i>

49:14.895 --> 49:21.115
<i>But nowhere was the clamor of gold</i>
<i>heard more eagerly than in St. Louis...</i>

49:21.275 --> 49:23.785
<i>... the busiest fur-trading center</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

49:23.945 --> 49:28.205
<i>... and the noisiest, bawdiest,</i>
<i>most uppity town west of New York.</i>

50:17.795 --> 50:19.415
I say there's no more than three.

50:19.795 --> 50:20.835
- Six.
- Six?

50:21.005 --> 50:23.095
It's that lace that fooled you. I say three.

50:23.255 --> 50:27.055
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on
petticoats. Anyway, you can never prove it.

50:27.215 --> 50:29.265
We're going to be late
for that poker game.

50:29.425 --> 50:32.225
Look, I've just stuck you
for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis.

50:32.395 --> 50:36.355
I don't mind sticking you a bit deeper.
I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.

50:36.525 --> 50:38.855
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.

50:39.025 --> 50:42.485
- If I go back and check with you.
- Fair enough.

50:49.745 --> 50:51.705
Second girl.

50:55.035 --> 50:57.085
- Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
- Later.

50:57.245 --> 50:59.585
It's rather important.

50:59.755 --> 51:01.335
It's always important.

51:01.505 --> 51:04.085
The older they are,
the more important it gets.

51:04.255 --> 51:06.845
Miss Prescott, please.
I am Hylan Seabury...

51:07.005 --> 51:10.095
...attorney in the matter
of Jonathan Brooks.

51:10.385 --> 51:12.265
He means nothing to you?

51:12.435 --> 51:13.725
That old goat?

51:13.895 --> 51:16.515
Well, you must've meant
something to him, Miss Prescott.

51:16.685 --> 51:18.435
- Why?
- You're included in his will.

51:18.605 --> 51:22.355
Of course, you have to make the trip
to California to claim the bequest.

51:22.525 --> 51:24.905
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...

51:25.065 --> 51:27.985
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.

51:28.155 --> 51:30.745
I don't think Mr. Astor
had holdings there, no.

51:30.905 --> 51:34.075
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks, property is not to be scorned.

51:34.245 --> 51:38.545
- Yield of what?
- Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

51:38.705 --> 51:40.625
- Gold?
- Precisely.

51:40.795 --> 51:46.465
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.

51:46.635 --> 51:48.755
Gold mine?

51:51.095 --> 51:53.685
Well. Well, I...

51:53.845 --> 51:56.605
That sweet old goat.

51:59.895 --> 52:01.895
For heavens...

52:13.365 --> 52:15.115
Well.

52:15.285 --> 52:16.955
This is an unexpected pleasure.

52:17.125 --> 52:19.375
- Where's the money?
- Money?

52:19.535 --> 52:20.625
Money?

52:20.795 --> 52:24.715
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course,
to our little agreement.

52:25.465 --> 52:27.715
One hundred to start you off...

52:27.885 --> 52:29.675
...and my share of the winnings.

52:31.135 --> 52:35.765
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report
that the hundred no longer exists.

52:37.805 --> 52:39.685
That $100, I assure you...

52:39.855 --> 52:44.435
...will turn out to be the best investment
you have ever made.

52:44.605 --> 52:46.525
I have plans, gentlemen...

52:46.695 --> 52:49.485
...beyond your wildest dreams.

52:49.655 --> 52:53.495
I'm gonna earn you
a piece of a gold mine.

52:53.825 --> 52:55.955
Gold mine.

52:56.325 --> 52:58.165
You ain't gonna earn nothing.

52:58.325 --> 53:01.125
You ain't gonna be nothing,
you ain't gonna do nothing...

53:01.285 --> 53:03.545
...unless we get that 100 back
by the morning.

53:03.705 --> 53:06.005
Grimes, you don't mean that.

53:06.165 --> 53:10.005
- You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
- Call it what you want, mister.

53:10.175 --> 53:12.095
We'll be waiting.

53:34.535 --> 53:39.785
<i>Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off</i>
<i>point for emigrants from everywhere.</i>

53:39.955 --> 53:44.375
<i>Solid, God-fearing families</i>
<i>bound for the farmlands of Oregon...</i>

53:44.545 --> 53:49.715
<i>... and get-rich-quick adventurers</i>
<i>racing for the gold of California.</i>

53:52.295 --> 53:54.055
Try it.

53:59.225 --> 54:02.055
- You got a wagon, I suppose?
- I can get one.

54:02.225 --> 54:03.475
And a team to pull it?

54:03.645 --> 54:05.025
I can get everything I need.

54:05.855 --> 54:09.235
- You got a husband?
- I'm single, Mr. Morgan.

54:09.395 --> 54:11.695
No traveling companion?

54:11.865 --> 54:15.035
- No, I'm traveling alone.
- Not on my wagon train.

54:16.035 --> 54:18.705
Alone and single brings out
the deviltry in a man.

54:18.865 --> 54:22.205
Gets them all worked up
and they're wild enough already.

54:22.375 --> 54:24.745
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

54:25.915 --> 54:28.165
Oh, woman of your sort?

54:28.375 --> 54:33.135
One day you'd find yourself in trouble, and
there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.

54:33.295 --> 54:36.715
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

54:37.015 --> 54:41.765
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.

54:41.935 --> 54:46.225
Hey, you got a pretty face
under that powder too.

54:46.395 --> 54:50.195
And a fine, sturdy body
under them clothes, I wager.

54:52.275 --> 54:55.275
There's a woman named Clegg,
Aggie Clegg.

54:55.445 --> 54:57.485
Why don't you go see her?

55:05.415 --> 55:07.205
Thanks.

55:16.175 --> 55:18.255
I told you, no.

55:18.425 --> 55:21.305
I was hoping to make this trip
with a husband.

55:21.475 --> 55:22.885
Nearly got one last week.

55:23.305 --> 55:27.065
Look, I hear there's 40 men
to every woman in California.

55:27.225 --> 55:30.815
- Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.
- I don't need money.

55:30.985 --> 55:33.315
I need a man.

55:34.315 --> 55:36.445
Any man.

55:43.155 --> 55:45.245
Morning, ladies.

55:45.825 --> 55:47.915
Beautiful morning.

55:48.495 --> 55:52.375
Would you, by any chance,
happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?

55:52.715 --> 55:55.135
Not unless you got a big imagination.

55:55.295 --> 55:57.845
Then you must be the lady in question.

55:58.005 --> 56:00.425
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott,
at your service.

56:00.595 --> 56:03.345
At your every command
from here to California.

56:03.515 --> 56:04.725
Well, thank you.

56:04.885 --> 56:07.105
But whatever you're offering,
I don't need.

56:08.435 --> 56:09.685
Perhaps you don't understand.

56:11.025 --> 56:14.105
Yes, I do.
I know a tinhorn when I see one.

56:14.275 --> 56:15.695
Miss Prescott.

56:15.855 --> 56:18.905
I'm offering you an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay.

56:19.075 --> 56:22.695
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.

56:23.745 --> 56:26.415
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Clegg.

56:26.575 --> 56:32.085
May I say I have never seen a woman
with more beautiful hair.

56:32.255 --> 56:34.375
What a prize catch it'll make...

56:34.545 --> 56:37.335
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.

56:37.715 --> 56:42.385
Beauty alone in the wilderness,
and who's to protect you?

56:42.555 --> 56:43.635
No one.

56:43.805 --> 56:48.935
Not one person
won't be looking after himself.

56:50.725 --> 56:52.315
Well...

56:54.275 --> 56:57.985
Good day, ladies. Good day.

57:01.825 --> 57:05.075
Nobody ever said that to me before.

57:05.245 --> 57:07.035
What?

57:07.365 --> 57:11.245
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.

57:14.085 --> 57:16.255
You know something?

57:16.415 --> 57:20.925
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men
like fish to the bait.

57:21.095 --> 57:25.015
Maybe I can catch one of them
while they swim by.

57:25.765 --> 57:28.225
You got yourself a partner.

57:28.385 --> 57:29.805
Thank you.

57:31.435 --> 57:33.355
How's it, men?

57:33.815 --> 57:37.605
It's all clear through here. Look for
a little mudhole up through the next pocket.

57:37.775 --> 57:39.775
How far?
Oh, maybe half a quarter.

57:39.945 --> 57:42.945
Well, thanks.
Looks a little higher up on that ridge.

57:43.115 --> 57:46.995
There's a water hole up there
about half a mile. Let's head for it.

57:54.335 --> 57:57.045
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

58:01.135 --> 58:03.465
Hey, you're driving.

58:03.885 --> 58:06.715
I was raised on a farm.

58:09.935 --> 58:11.595
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

58:50.095 --> 58:51.265
Hey, Aggie?

58:52.845 --> 58:55.765
- Can you use these?
Yeah, sure.

58:55.935 --> 58:57.775
Thanks.

59:10.535 --> 59:12.035
Ladies.

59:21.415 --> 59:23.295
At your service.

59:23.465 --> 59:25.045
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

59:25.215 --> 59:28.965
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of
you two making this trip without my help.

59:29.135 --> 59:33.015
If I was to hear later on that something
happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.

59:33.185 --> 59:34.645
You came 100 miles alone?

59:34.805 --> 59:39.315
Well, I had no way of counting the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.

59:39.475 --> 59:41.735
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.

59:41.895 --> 59:45.065
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...

59:45.235 --> 59:46.985
...not bet how long it'll take.

59:47.155 --> 59:48.825
You don't mean you'll turn me out?

59:48.985 --> 59:51.575
Pass me adrift at the mercy
of savage Indians?

59:51.745 --> 59:53.915
If you don't get moving,
I'll cast you adrift...

59:54.075 --> 59:56.875
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.

59:57.035 --> 01:00:00.335
I'm prepared to wager you
that I stay with this train.

01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:03.415
- Well, you got a wager.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:00:03.585 --> 01:00:05.425
The fact is, I hired this man.

01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:08.045
We'll put up his stake.

01:00:10.255 --> 01:00:12.095
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

01:00:12.265 --> 01:00:14.805
If Miss Clegg says so.

01:00:25.485 --> 01:00:27.195
Ma'am...

01:00:27.695 --> 01:00:29.445
...I'll be forever grateful.

01:00:33.195 --> 01:00:36.495
Now, I'll unpack my gear.

01:00:39.455 --> 01:00:42.125
Agatha, have you gone crazy?

01:00:42.295 --> 01:00:45.295
He says he's a man
wanting to do an honest day's work.

01:00:46.465 --> 01:00:49.635
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.

01:00:50.505 --> 01:00:53.595
Hey, you men on that last wagon,
keep up that slack.

01:00:53.765 --> 01:00:55.555
Keep it up.

01:00:55.975 --> 01:00:59.395
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.

01:01:01.975 --> 01:01:04.735
Don't let those lines sag.

01:01:05.945 --> 01:01:08.355
Keep them up. Keep them up.

01:01:12.025 --> 01:01:14.535
Keep those teams moving.

01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:18.415
Keep them moving.

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:21.915
Don't let those lines sag.

01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:25.545
You, on that middle team,
keep them moving.

01:01:35.515 --> 01:01:37.135
Get in there.
Over here, Pa.

01:01:37.305 --> 01:01:39.055
Get in there.

01:01:39.975 --> 01:01:43.685
Get in there. Get in there, mule.

01:02:17.055 --> 01:02:21.475
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention,
Miss Prescott.

01:02:28.895 --> 01:02:30.985
I want to confess...

01:02:31.155 --> 01:02:36.075
...I have lied about
why I wanted to work for you.

01:02:36.235 --> 01:02:37.945
I know.

01:02:38.905 --> 01:02:42.495
The real reason is, of course,
that I'm in love with you.

01:02:42.665 --> 01:02:43.995
No.

01:02:44.165 --> 01:02:45.455
It's the truth.

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:51.465
From the first moment I saw you,
I've known that I couldn't live without you.

01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:57.265
Well, I'd hate to be the cause
of your death, Mr. Van Valen.

01:02:57.425 --> 01:02:59.555
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.

01:02:59.725 --> 01:03:04.015
I'm prepared to assume
the responsibilities of a faithful husband.

01:03:04.185 --> 01:03:07.475
Oh, and are you ready to assume
the responsibilities...

01:03:07.645 --> 01:03:10.065
...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?

01:03:11.105 --> 01:03:12.985
Really?

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:14.775
What kind of property?

01:03:15.905 --> 01:03:17.945
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.

01:03:18.115 --> 01:03:21.205
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:25.375
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.

01:03:26.785 --> 01:03:30.125
Why, I had no idea.

01:03:31.465 --> 01:03:34.675
- I'm sure you hadn't.
- Miss Prescott, I really mean...

01:03:34.835 --> 01:03:39.715
Here comes Agatha.
If you must propose to somebody...

01:03:39.885 --> 01:03:42.515
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:46.225
Besides, she has beautiful hair.

01:03:47.645 --> 01:03:49.525
Look at them.

01:03:49.685 --> 01:03:52.525
Think they was getting ready
to bury somebody.

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:55.525
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?

01:03:55.695 --> 01:03:59.285
Well, let's wake them up.

01:04:02.325 --> 01:04:03.825
Listen, everybody.

01:05:23.195 --> 01:05:26.495
That's the spirit! That's the way to feel!

01:05:35.255 --> 01:05:37.965
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!

01:05:50.805 --> 01:05:53.435
Aggie. For lunch.

01:05:53.605 --> 01:05:57.025
Thanks. Nice nest of fish.

01:06:04.325 --> 01:06:06.655
What is it, Mr. Morgan?

01:06:06.905 --> 01:06:09.785
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.

01:06:10.785 --> 01:06:12.455
Oh?

01:06:14.495 --> 01:06:17.965
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman
I ever did see.

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:20.795
Spirit and a fine, sturdy body.

01:06:21.135 --> 01:06:23.635
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.

01:06:23.795 --> 01:06:27.975
Why, for you, childbearing would
come as easy as rolling off a log.

01:06:29.935 --> 01:06:33.725
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log,
Mr. Morgan.

01:06:34.475 --> 01:06:36.975
Ma'am, I'm telling you,
you got the build for it.

01:06:37.775 --> 01:06:40.195
I want you for my wife.

01:06:40.485 --> 01:06:43.115
I've got a cattle ranch
just below the Merced.

01:06:43.945 --> 01:06:46.405
I'll be settling down there, fit and proper.

01:06:47.945 --> 01:06:50.955
I'm sure you're very fit and proper,
Mr. Morgan.

01:06:51.665 --> 01:06:53.205
Well, then...

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:56.245
...you just couldn't do no better
than marrying me.

01:06:56.625 --> 01:07:00.165
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family
in no time at all.

01:07:01.545 --> 01:07:03.795
I believe that.

01:07:04.715 --> 01:07:06.595
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan...

01:07:07.765 --> 01:07:09.475
...but I can't accept your proposal.

01:07:09.635 --> 01:07:11.185
Why not?

01:07:11.935 --> 01:07:16.265
Well, a woman likes to hear something
a little more inviting.

01:07:17.525 --> 01:07:20.525
Well, ain't that what I've been doing?
Inviting you?

01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:23.315
Inviting you to share my life,
Miss Prescott.

01:07:26.735 --> 01:07:29.325
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

01:07:30.865 --> 01:07:32.955
It's something else, ain't it?

01:07:33.915 --> 01:07:36.205
Must be something else nagging at you.

01:07:37.285 --> 01:07:39.125
Well...

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:42.585
...I don't aim to let it stop me,
Miss Prescott.

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:45.675
You can count on that.

01:07:45.845 --> 01:07:47.925
What did he want?

01:07:49.055 --> 01:07:50.925
Children.

01:07:51.345 --> 01:07:52.885
Children?

01:07:53.055 --> 01:07:55.435
Well, I'll be...

01:07:55.595 --> 01:07:58.895
Why didn't he come shopping
at the right store?

01:08:41.975 --> 01:08:44.484
- I'll take a look.
- Well.

01:08:44.645 --> 01:08:46.814
Now, gentlemen, are we pikers?

01:08:46.984 --> 01:08:50.024
I'm gonna see
and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol...

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:53.075
...London-made and loaded for bear.

01:08:53.365 --> 01:08:55.955
I'll take part of that bet.

01:09:02.545 --> 01:09:05.585
I told you I wouldn't stand
for you fleecing any...

01:09:08.635 --> 01:09:09.715
Cheyennes.

01:09:10.965 --> 01:09:13.385
There's too many to fight.
We'll have to run for it.

01:09:13.555 --> 01:09:15.135
You can't outrun them with wagons.

01:09:15.305 --> 01:09:17.515
The minute you get moving,
cut your teams loose.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.604
- Have you gone crazy?
- Go on, get moving.

01:09:19.765 --> 01:09:21.814
Chances are they want our stock
more than us.

01:09:21.975 --> 01:09:24.895
Now, you're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get moving.

01:09:41.835 --> 01:09:44.045
Keep them closed up there.

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:57.765
I don't know how to unhook them.

01:11:02.075 --> 01:11:03.745
Cleve, watch out!

01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:39.695
Cleve!

01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:08.645
Joe, pick me up.

01:12:55.025 --> 01:12:57.155
We'll be moving at daybreak.

01:12:57.605 --> 01:13:00.485
I'll take a few men,
see if we can find him.

01:13:00.655 --> 01:13:03.245
Give him a decent, Christian burial.

01:13:10.835 --> 01:13:13.915
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!

01:13:57.755 --> 01:14:01.755
Well, I can let you have this rig for a dollar
a day, and I'll give you a good team.

01:14:01.925 --> 01:14:03.965
- Pick it up in the morning.
- That'll be fine.

01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:06.265
Could you tell me the way
to the Brooks claim?

01:14:06.425 --> 01:14:08.885
Well, the claims are down by the river.

01:14:09.055 --> 01:14:12.805
- Which road should I take?
- Only one road. Along the river.

01:14:12.975 --> 01:14:14.525
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.

01:14:29.075 --> 01:14:31.455
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:33.495
You found him.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:40.965
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.

01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:42.385
I figured.

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:44.805
They told me you was a real looker.

01:14:44.965 --> 01:14:49.225
Yup. It's all here for you.
Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:51.135
Must've had 20 men working on it.

01:14:51.305 --> 01:14:54.145
Well, where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?

01:14:54.515 --> 01:14:59.145
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade
since I come here with Millie.

01:14:59.525 --> 01:15:01.105
It was just a pocket, though.

01:15:01.275 --> 01:15:04.575
The whole shebang, nothing but a pocket.

01:15:04.735 --> 01:15:08.405
Oh, we cleared 4200
before it played out.

01:15:08.575 --> 01:15:10.785
Now, about that 4200...

01:15:10.955 --> 01:15:13.455
Mr. Brooks, he spent three
before his heart give out.

01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:16.495
I put up 600 for a brass-handled casket.

01:15:16.665 --> 01:15:20.295
I figure the rest you owe me
for sitting on your claim.

01:15:24.005 --> 01:15:27.175
Oh, miss, I mean, that's only fair, ain't it?

01:15:27.345 --> 01:15:29.555
I mean, wouldn't you...?

01:15:36.185 --> 01:15:38.355
Funny pair, all right.

01:16:00.415 --> 01:16:03.175
How about you boys?
Come and see the brand-new attraction.

01:16:03.335 --> 01:16:06.045
It's exciting and sensational.
Step right in, gentlemen.

01:17:22.795 --> 01:17:24.295
Miss Prescott?

01:17:24.455 --> 01:17:25.875
Hello, Mr. Morgan.

01:17:26.045 --> 01:17:30.595
I'd invite you in, but it's a little cramped.

01:17:42.225 --> 01:17:44.395
This is no life for a fine woman like you.

01:17:48.065 --> 01:17:51.065
I heard your mine was played out.

01:17:52.075 --> 01:17:54.115
But where's your fancy friend?

01:17:54.285 --> 01:17:56.075
Cleve?

01:17:56.655 --> 01:18:00.125
Last I heard, he was in Hangtown.

01:18:00.995 --> 01:18:03.835
You mean that no-good went off
and left you?

01:18:06.505 --> 01:18:08.675
He went off and left me.

01:18:10.675 --> 01:18:13.465
But I don't agree that he's no good.

01:18:14.095 --> 01:18:16.345
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.

01:18:19.555 --> 01:18:22.685
You're a perplexing woman,
Miss Prescott.

01:18:23.355 --> 01:18:25.815
When a skunk needs killing...

01:18:26.145 --> 01:18:29.025
...well, it ain't enough just to say
a skunk's a skunk.

01:18:29.195 --> 01:18:30.945
Mr. Morgan...

01:18:31.565 --> 01:18:35.075
...all my life I've wanted
to marry a rich husband.

01:18:35.865 --> 01:18:39.535
Can I blame Cleve for wanting
to marry a rich wife?

01:18:41.415 --> 01:18:44.625
Both of us may have been born
for the poorhouse...

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:48.415
...but we're not the kind to like it.

01:18:49.665 --> 01:18:52.675
Do you believe all this you've been saying,
or is it just words?

01:18:52.835 --> 01:18:53.965
Now, tell me the truth.

01:18:57.715 --> 01:18:59.635
The truth is...

01:18:59.805 --> 01:19:03.895
...Cleve and I couldn't live alone
just on love.

01:19:04.055 --> 01:19:05.645
Not for five minutes.

01:19:06.265 --> 01:19:11.775
Then you've answered the question I've
been asking for better than 2000 miles.

01:19:12.905 --> 01:19:15.235
I got the biggest ranch you ever did see.

01:19:15.405 --> 01:19:18.325
You can't ride across it in a day.

01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:21.915
That land's gonna mean money
sooner than you think.

01:19:23.535 --> 01:19:25.835
You want a rich husband...

01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:28.375
...you're looking at him.

01:19:36.345 --> 01:19:39.765
There ain't a blessed thing you have to do
except mind the kids.

01:19:43.095 --> 01:19:44.975
I'm sorry.

01:19:46.265 --> 01:19:48.225
Not now.

01:19:48.525 --> 01:19:50.185
Not ever.

01:19:57.525 --> 01:19:59.575
What a waste.

01:20:02.205 --> 01:20:04.825
Someone put together like you.

01:20:10.915 --> 01:20:12.585
Aggie.

01:20:16.135 --> 01:20:20.805
<i>Those who struck it rich wanted</i>
<i>all the pleasures that money could buy.</i>

01:20:20.965 --> 01:20:23.305
<i>And there were plenty to sell to them.</i>

01:20:23.475 --> 01:20:27.895
<i>Even the Sacramento riverboats</i>
<i>took on luxury goods.</i>

01:20:50.705 --> 01:20:52.625
I'll see it.

01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:56.085
It's up to you.

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.715
Betting?

01:21:01.885 --> 01:21:03.925
What's the matter with you?

01:21:05.435 --> 01:21:07.145
- I'm checking out.
- Checking out?

01:21:07.305 --> 01:21:09.185
What's the matter with him?

01:22:39.275 --> 01:22:42.275
Lily, I got to talk to you.

01:22:45.235 --> 01:22:48.455
I found myself throwing in
a winning hand.

01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:51.825
Well, I just never thought
I'd do that for any girl.

01:22:51.995 --> 01:22:53.625
Lily.

01:22:54.785 --> 01:22:57.955
How'd you like to hook up
with a no-good gambler?

01:23:02.795 --> 01:23:06.005
Oh, hon, we are on our way.
I got $1200 right here.

01:23:06.175 --> 01:23:08.515
- What'll we do, open a gambling house?
- No.

01:23:09.175 --> 01:23:11.385
A married man should spend
his evenings at home.

01:23:11.555 --> 01:23:13.725
Then we'll open a music hall
in San Francisco.

01:23:13.895 --> 01:23:15.395
- No.
- I can still sing and dance.

01:23:15.565 --> 01:23:18.525
No. A married woman should
spend her evenings at home.

01:23:18.685 --> 01:23:22.775
- But we can't sit at home on $1200 for...
- Lily.

01:23:22.945 --> 01:23:25.365
Have you seen San Francisco?

01:23:25.525 --> 01:23:29.195
It's ugly, and it's small,
and it's full of fleas.

01:23:29.365 --> 01:23:31.455
And it burns down
about every five minutes...

01:23:31.615 --> 01:23:36.495
...but each time they keep on rebuilding it
a little bigger and better than before.

01:23:36.665 --> 01:23:40.665
It's alive and kicking
and nothing can stop it.

01:23:40.835 --> 01:23:43.795
And it makes you
wanna build something too.

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:45.925
A railroad.

01:23:46.095 --> 01:23:48.215
A steamship line.

01:23:48.385 --> 01:23:50.975
Something to help the baby grow.

01:23:51.135 --> 01:23:53.645
Cleve, on $1200?

01:23:53.805 --> 01:23:57.355
We could start out
with a wagon or a rowboat.

01:23:57.515 --> 01:24:00.815
With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.

01:29:43.575 --> 01:29:48.495
<i>Young America was not only</i>
<i>a union of East and West.</i>

01:29:48.665 --> 01:29:51.285
<i>There were North and South too.</i>

01:29:51.455 --> 01:29:54.835
<i>And between them,</i>
<i>the bonds were weakening.</i>

01:29:55.005 --> 01:29:58.255
<i>Mr. Lincoln, now retired</i>
<i>from Congress and practicing law...</i>

01:29:58.425 --> 01:30:00.715
<i>... realized that the South would fight...</i>

01:30:00.885 --> 01:30:05.055
<i>... to mold the new and</i>
<i>uncommitted territories to its own image.</i>

01:30:05.305 --> 01:30:07.685
<i>Still two years from the presidency...</i>

01:30:07.845 --> 01:30:11.355
<i>... he pleaded that the free West</i>
<i>be allowed to remain free...</i>

01:30:11.515 --> 01:30:14.725
<i>... and warned of the hazards</i>
<i>of a house divided against itself.</i>

01:30:15.605 --> 01:30:19.565
<i>But the South,</i>
<i>seeing its power and influence wane...</i>

01:30:19.735 --> 01:30:24.365
<i>... struggled against the inevitable</i>
<i>in dozens of Western towns.</i>

01:30:24.535 --> 01:30:29.865
<i>And slowly, the bitter seeds of civil war</i>
<i>took root.</i>

01:31:06.445 --> 01:31:08.405
Howdy, Ms. Rawlings.

01:31:11.325 --> 01:31:13.785
Whoa, Rosebud, whoa.

01:31:14.665 --> 01:31:18.505
Say, Mr. Peterson,
what's that suit you got on?

01:31:18.665 --> 01:31:22.835
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings. A uniform.

01:31:23.005 --> 01:31:25.805
Our militia company was sworn in...

01:31:25.965 --> 01:31:29.765
...and I'm Corporal Peterson now,
Ohio Volunteers.

01:31:30.305 --> 01:31:32.975
You won't be seeing me for a spell.

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:37.355
Hey, I got a letter for you,
from way out in California.

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:40.275
It must be from my sister, Lilith.

01:31:44.315 --> 01:31:46.485
"Dear Eve..."

01:31:50.955 --> 01:31:53.455
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?

01:31:53.615 --> 01:31:55.535
I wanna answer this right away.

01:31:55.995 --> 01:31:57.455
Zeb?

01:31:57.625 --> 01:31:59.455
Zeb, come on down here.

01:31:59.625 --> 01:32:03.675
Well, we was hoping
that Zeb might be going with us.

01:32:03.835 --> 01:32:06.885
His pa went when the first bugle blew.

01:32:07.045 --> 01:32:08.255
Ain't one enough?

01:32:09.715 --> 01:32:11.135
Hi, corporal.

01:32:13.225 --> 01:32:16.185
Jeremiah, get Mr. Peterson
some buttermilk.

01:32:16.355 --> 01:32:18.645
Buttermilk.

01:32:29.575 --> 01:32:31.405
It's from your aunt Lilith.

01:32:31.575 --> 01:32:35.785
She says there ain't no war out in California
and they don't expect there'll be one.

01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:38.835
"Business is brisk.

01:32:38.995 --> 01:32:42.505
Many opportunities
for an energetic young man."

01:32:42.665 --> 01:32:45.925
There's talk of building a railroad east.

01:32:46.085 --> 01:32:49.135
"Cleve has hopes of getting in
on the ground floor.

01:32:49.965 --> 01:32:52.555
We would welcome Zeb
if he wants to come."

01:32:52.725 --> 01:32:56.645
Ma, did you write her about me?

01:32:57.265 --> 01:33:00.225
- Not exactly.
- Now, did you?

01:33:00.395 --> 01:33:04.105
I told her you didn't like farming
any better than your pa did.

01:33:04.275 --> 01:33:07.275
Ma, you got the wrong idea
about this war.

01:33:07.445 --> 01:33:10.195
It ain't gonna be so bad, is it, corporal?

01:33:10.365 --> 01:33:12.325
You know Pa's having the time of his life.

01:33:12.495 --> 01:33:15.285
Now, Ms. Rawlings,
I got it from the captain himself...

01:33:15.455 --> 01:33:18.915
...that we ain't gonna be gone
no time at all.

01:33:20.665 --> 01:33:23.085
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not.

01:33:23.255 --> 01:33:24.875
But you know what he really felt.

01:33:25.045 --> 01:33:28.835
Ms. Rawlings, there ain't much glory
in tromping behind a plow.

01:33:29.925 --> 01:33:33.595
Reckon there's no hurry
in answering this letter.

01:33:34.135 --> 01:33:36.095
Thank you for waiting.

01:33:38.345 --> 01:33:40.265
You mean I can go?

01:33:41.935 --> 01:33:44.605
Oh, there'll be things to do.

01:33:46.235 --> 01:33:47.815
Ma...

01:33:49.775 --> 01:33:54.325
Gotta get your underwear washed
and your socks darned.

01:33:56.495 --> 01:33:59.495
Do they give you one of them suits?

01:33:59.665 --> 01:34:02.415
One of them uniforms?

01:34:02.875 --> 01:34:04.955
I reckon.

01:34:06.295 --> 01:34:09.005
Might not give you no shirts, though.

01:34:09.175 --> 01:34:12.045
Take that one off, I'll wash it for you.

01:34:12.595 --> 01:34:15.635
I got the others washed,
they aren't ironed yet.

01:34:16.845 --> 01:34:18.515
Mother, I...

01:34:21.685 --> 01:34:23.725
Why'd you call me that?

01:34:23.895 --> 01:34:26.565
It's always been "Ma" before.

01:34:28.945 --> 01:34:30.655
I don't know.

01:34:31.195 --> 01:34:33.235
All of a sudden...

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:37.075
..."Ma" didn't seem enough somehow.

01:34:55.635 --> 01:34:58.055
Hey, cowpoke!

01:35:51.065 --> 01:35:53.445
Go on back, dog!

01:35:54.025 --> 01:35:55.735
Go on!

01:36:18.805 --> 01:36:21.135
What could I do, Pa?

01:36:21.305 --> 01:36:23.725
He's Linus, boy.

01:36:26.305 --> 01:36:29.275
Always was more Linus, blood.

01:36:32.315 --> 01:36:35.405
I guess that's why I love him so much.

01:36:40.615 --> 01:36:43.455
But you've gotta help me pray, Pa.

01:36:48.165 --> 01:36:50.165
Help me pray.

01:37:27.995 --> 01:37:29.165
Ohio.

01:37:29.335 --> 01:37:32.205
Battery B, Ohio!

01:37:32.375 --> 01:37:34.295
- Let's go!
On the double, come on!

01:37:34.465 --> 01:37:38.715
Anybody here from the 12th Michigan?

01:37:38.885 --> 01:37:42.465
Thirty-sixth Indiana.

01:37:44.885 --> 01:37:48.845
<i>Evening of April 6th, 1862.</i>

01:37:49.055 --> 01:37:52.185
<i>The guns that had roared all day</i>
<i>fell silent...</i>

01:37:52.355 --> 01:37:57.945
<i>... around a little church</i>
<i>called the Shiloh Meeting House.</i>

01:37:58.105 --> 01:38:01.985
<i>Many a man had met his God</i>
<i>that Sunday...</i>

01:38:02.235 --> 01:38:03.825
<i>... but not in church.</i>

01:38:12.285 --> 01:38:14.205
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.

01:38:14.375 --> 01:38:18.625
- But, doc, this here is Captain Rawlings.
- Captain Linus Rawlings.

01:38:18.795 --> 01:38:21.675
- Take him out.
- Keep moving, men.

01:38:30.225 --> 01:38:33.895
- Why can't you look where you're going?
- I'm sorry, soldier.

01:38:34.065 --> 01:38:35.815
Watch it.

01:38:42.615 --> 01:38:44.825
Saw. Brandy.

01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:46.155
Chloroform.

01:38:47.405 --> 01:38:50.575
Get it all down. Come on, all of it.

01:38:52.415 --> 01:38:55.085
Come on, we're just in the way here.

01:38:59.425 --> 01:39:04.345
<i>It had been the bloodiest day</i>
<i>of the war on the Western front.</i>

01:39:04.635 --> 01:39:10.225
<i>In the morning, it had looked like</i>
<i>a Confederate victory, but by nightfall...</i>

01:39:10.385 --> 01:39:15.145
<i>... no man cared to use</i>
<i>the words "win" or "lose."</i>

01:39:16.855 --> 01:39:19.235
<i>After Shiloh...</i>

01:39:20.065 --> 01:39:22.945
<i>... the South never smiled.</i>

01:39:36.955 --> 01:39:38.915
- You tasted that water yet?
- No.

01:39:39.085 --> 01:39:40.965
Well, try it.

01:39:45.925 --> 01:39:47.925
- Tastes funny, huh?
- Yeah.

01:39:48.095 --> 01:39:50.805
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.

01:39:50.975 --> 01:39:53.475
Pinker than sassafras tea.

01:39:53.645 --> 01:39:54.765
You mean...?

01:39:54.935 --> 01:39:57.935
It don't seem fitting a man should have
to drink water like that.

01:39:58.105 --> 01:40:01.695
Don't seem fitting a man should have
to do any of the things we've done today.

01:40:01.855 --> 01:40:04.655
Did you kill anybody?

01:40:04.815 --> 01:40:06.985
I don't think so.

01:40:07.365 --> 01:40:10.035
I got knocked dizzy right off.

01:40:10.865 --> 01:40:15.165
And when I come to, found my rifle,
it was busted.

01:40:16.415 --> 01:40:21.125
And then some more soldiers come along
and tried to stick me in the arm.

01:40:22.875 --> 01:40:25.675
All the rest is mixed up after that.

01:40:25.835 --> 01:40:30.015
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.

01:40:31.095 --> 01:40:34.475
- Hey, where you from?
- Ohio.

01:40:34.645 --> 01:40:38.435
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?

01:40:38.605 --> 01:40:41.815
I don't rightly know anymore.

01:40:46.065 --> 01:40:48.615
It ain't quite what I expected.

01:40:50.405 --> 01:40:55.415
There ain't much glory looking at a man
with his guts hanging out.

01:40:58.035 --> 01:41:00.875
- Where are you from?
- Texas.

01:41:02.375 --> 01:41:03.965
Say...

01:41:04.295 --> 01:41:06.255
You ain't a Reb, are you?

01:41:06.425 --> 01:41:11.135
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.

01:41:11.595 --> 01:41:15.435
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.

01:41:16.265 --> 01:41:19.515
Well, you got anything to shoot with?

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:22.895
No.

01:41:23.065 --> 01:41:25.565
All I got's this bayonet.

01:41:26.065 --> 01:41:28.235
I got a pistol.

01:41:29.115 --> 01:41:32.155
I took it off a dead officer.

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:37.915
Hey, why don't we
skedaddle out of here?

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.705
- You mean desert?
- I mean, why don't...?

01:41:40.875 --> 01:41:44.455
Just leave this here war
to the folks who'd want it.

01:41:49.595 --> 01:41:53.595
They say there ain't no war
out in California.

01:41:54.805 --> 01:41:57.515
Get that battery over here.

01:41:59.895 --> 01:42:04.895
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!

01:42:13.445 --> 01:42:16.785
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade
into this area.

01:42:17.455 --> 01:42:22.125
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?

01:42:22.285 --> 01:42:25.295
I'll approve any dispositions
you wanna make.

01:42:25.455 --> 01:42:29.635
If you hadn't held the flank today,
we'd have been whipped for fair.

01:42:30.175 --> 01:42:34.555
Sherman, let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.

01:42:36.265 --> 01:42:38.185
Lantern.

01:42:43.815 --> 01:42:45.975
You may find yourself in command here.

01:42:46.145 --> 01:42:47.235
Why?

01:42:47.855 --> 01:42:53.775
I've seen some of the dispatches the
newspaper correspondents have filed today.

01:42:53.945 --> 01:42:57.075
They're saying
I was taken by surprise this morning.

01:42:57.245 --> 01:42:59.915
You weren't taken by surprise.

01:43:00.075 --> 01:43:01.325
I was.

01:43:01.495 --> 01:43:03.245
No matter.

01:43:03.625 --> 01:43:04.745
They're saying...

01:43:06.545 --> 01:43:09.215
...I was drunk again last night.

01:43:11.925 --> 01:43:13.595
Were you?

01:43:16.005 --> 01:43:17.515
No.

01:43:18.175 --> 01:43:21.135
But you can't fight front and rear.

01:43:21.305 --> 01:43:23.555
Win or lose, tomorrow...

01:43:24.515 --> 01:43:26.185
...I intend to resign.

01:43:27.895 --> 01:43:30.565
Because of the newspapers?

01:43:32.565 --> 01:43:35.695
Because of a general
lack of confidence in me.

01:43:35.865 --> 01:43:38.995
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?

01:43:39.155 --> 01:43:42.745
A month ago they were saying
I was crazy. Insane.

01:43:42.915 --> 01:43:47.375
Now they're calling me a hero.
A hero or crazy, I'm the same man.

01:43:47.545 --> 01:43:49.915
It doesn't matter what the people think.

01:43:50.085 --> 01:43:51.675
It's what you think, Grant.

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.805
You mean that's Grant?

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.225
I reckon.

01:44:00.385 --> 01:44:02.555
General Grant.

01:44:02.725 --> 01:44:06.265
You know this war's gonna be won
in the West, and how to win it.

01:44:06.435 --> 01:44:08.975
Everything you've done proves it.

01:44:09.645 --> 01:44:14.865
And I say that a man has the right
to resign only if he's wrong.

01:44:15.155 --> 01:44:17.155
Not if he's right.

01:44:18.735 --> 01:44:23.365
I guess I never thought of it that way.

01:44:24.285 --> 01:44:25.495
I'll think it over.

01:44:26.415 --> 01:44:27.915
What is there to think about?

01:44:28.085 --> 01:44:32.295
The Army's better off with you
than without you. That's the test.

01:44:35.965 --> 01:44:37.675
All right.

01:44:38.095 --> 01:44:39.255
Thanks.

01:44:41.135 --> 01:44:44.055
There's a lot to do
before morning, Sherman.

01:44:44.225 --> 01:44:45.265
What are you doing?

01:45:03.905 --> 01:45:06.245
Why did you make me do that?

01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:56.085
Fire.

01:47:36.315 --> 01:47:38.275
Hey, Zeb!

01:48:03.465 --> 01:48:05.635
Didn't you get my letter?

01:48:06.805 --> 01:48:09.465
I wrote more than four months ago.

01:48:12.095 --> 01:48:13.845
She never was...

01:48:14.015 --> 01:48:18.145
...quite the same
after she got the news about Pa.

01:48:21.275 --> 01:48:24.485
I don't think she minded going,
Zeb, except...

01:48:26.115 --> 01:48:28.405
...she wanted to see you again.

01:48:33.245 --> 01:48:36.245
Of course Pa ain't really there.

01:48:38.625 --> 01:48:40.955
I put up a stone anyway.

01:49:00.105 --> 01:49:01.685
Well...

01:49:02.355 --> 01:49:04.485
...better be on my way.

01:49:05.025 --> 01:49:07.525
Way? Where?

01:49:07.695 --> 01:49:09.615
I need you, Zeb.

01:49:09.775 --> 01:49:12.245
Only one thing brought me back.

01:49:13.365 --> 01:49:15.325
She's...

01:49:15.495 --> 01:49:17.785
Well, this farm is half yours.

01:49:17.955 --> 01:49:22.545
I was thinking we'd finally clear away that
patch of woods down by the river and...

01:49:22.705 --> 01:49:26.375
You're twice the farmer I am.
You don't need me.

01:49:26.545 --> 01:49:30.175
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.

01:49:31.555 --> 01:49:34.345
Sure don't feel right about this.

01:49:34.515 --> 01:49:36.015
What are you gonna do?

01:49:36.185 --> 01:49:37.845
I haven't mustered out yet.

01:49:38.015 --> 01:49:40.145
I can still transfer to the regulars.

01:49:40.315 --> 01:49:43.395
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.

01:49:43.565 --> 01:49:46.065
Have to fight Indians?

01:49:46.905 --> 01:49:49.275
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.

01:49:49.445 --> 01:49:53.445
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?

01:49:54.745 --> 01:49:58.915
You remember the story Pa used to tell us
about fighting that grizzly bear?

01:49:59.075 --> 01:50:00.165
Yeah.

01:50:00.335 --> 01:50:03.585
And I asked him, I said,
"Well, why'd you get in such a fix?

01:50:03.755 --> 01:50:06.165
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"

01:50:06.335 --> 01:50:07.875
He said:

01:50:08.045 --> 01:50:12.385
"Well, uh, not especially. Uh...

01:50:12.595 --> 01:50:17.095
I just wanted to go somewhere
and the bear was there first."

01:50:29.655 --> 01:50:31.275
Well, I...

01:50:34.235 --> 01:50:37.035
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.

01:50:41.285 --> 01:50:44.745
- So long.
- So long, Zeb.

01:51:03.935 --> 01:51:07.235
<i>Even while North and South</i>
<i>were being torn apart...</i>

01:51:07.395 --> 01:51:11.275
<i>... East and West had been</i>
<i>drawn together by the Pony Express...</i>

01:51:11.445 --> 01:51:13.865
<i>... the most daring mail route in history.</i>

01:51:14.025 --> 01:51:17.695
<i>Eighty riders were in the saddle</i>
<i>at all times, night and day, in all weather.</i>

01:51:17.865 --> 01:51:20.665
<i>Half of them riding east,</i>
<i>half riding west...</i>

01:51:20.825 --> 01:51:22.955
<i>... between Missouri and Sacramento...</i>

01:51:23.125 --> 01:51:27.165
<i>... carrying mail across country</i>
<i>in days instead of months.</i>

01:51:27.335 --> 01:51:30.125
<i>Unarmed, they rode to save weight.</i>

01:51:30.295 --> 01:51:33.965
<i>Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,</i>
<i>and on thin paper too.</i>

01:51:34.135 --> 01:51:37.095
<i>It was courage, skill and speed...</i>

01:51:37.265 --> 01:51:42.765
<i>... against hostile Indians, bandits,</i>
<i>hell and occasional high water.</i>

01:51:43.305 --> 01:51:45.725
<i>Even as they rode,</i>
<i>men were already building...</i>

01:51:45.895 --> 01:51:50.695
<i>... a faster message carrier across</i>
<i>the country: The Overland Telegraph.</i>

01:51:50.855 --> 01:51:53.355
<i>And the Indians found</i>
<i>a new amusement...</i>

01:51:53.525 --> 01:51:56.695
<i>... listening to the level tune</i>
<i>of the singing wires.</i>

01:51:56.865 --> 01:51:58.995
<i>But far less amusing to the Indians...</i>

01:51:59.155 --> 01:52:03.035
<i>... was the coming of the steel roadway</i>
<i>of the iron horse.</i>

01:52:03.205 --> 01:52:09.205
<i>The surveyors, route lay through immense</i>
<i>natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...</i>

01:52:09.375 --> 01:52:12.625
<i>... and the equally discouraging</i>
<i>High Sierras.</i>

01:52:12.795 --> 01:52:16.715
<i>But range upon range could never stop</i>
<i>the titanic contest...</i>

01:52:16.885 --> 01:52:19.385
<i>... between two corporate giants</i>
<i>racing to put down...</i>

01:52:19.555 --> 01:52:22.885
<i>... the greatest mileage of track</i>
<i>before they met.</i>

01:52:23.055 --> 01:52:27.855
<i>The Central Pacific eastward</i>
<i>from Sacramento through the Sierras.</i>

01:52:31.685 --> 01:52:35.775
<i>And the Union Pacific,</i>
<i>forging westward across the plains...</i>

01:52:35.945 --> 01:52:37.825
<i>... with the Rockies still to come.</i>

01:52:37.985 --> 01:52:43.535
<i>The prize in the race was free land,</i>
<i>vast parcels for every mile of track laid.</i>

01:52:43.705 --> 01:52:47.125
<i>Land that would one day</i>
<i>be worth millions.</i>

01:52:52.295 --> 01:52:54.085
Hold it.

01:52:54.255 --> 01:52:56.045
Set it down.

01:52:56.585 --> 01:52:58.755
Workers, up.

01:53:04.765 --> 01:53:06.395
Where'd you find them?

01:53:06.555 --> 01:53:08.975
About a mile back yonder.

01:53:09.435 --> 01:53:12.895
That's Johnny Hormatz.
That's Jack Perkin.

01:53:15.065 --> 01:53:16.945
What the hell is this? A picnic?

01:53:17.115 --> 01:53:20.825
- Well, the Indians got a couple of our men...
- Mister, you were the foreman here.

01:53:20.985 --> 01:53:24.035
Now you're a tracklayer.
Now get back to work, all of you!

01:53:24.205 --> 01:53:25.575
Move it!

01:53:25.745 --> 01:53:27.375
Fast!

01:53:27.535 --> 01:53:28.665
- You.
- Yes, sir.

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:31.165
You're the foreman
till I can find somebody better.

01:53:31.335 --> 01:53:32.665
- Yes, sir.
- Get them at it.

01:53:32.835 --> 01:53:34.795
- Wait a minute.
- Move it!

01:53:34.965 --> 01:53:37.715
Your name Jethro Stuart?

01:53:38.005 --> 01:53:39.295
All right, get at it.

01:53:39.465 --> 01:53:43.095
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired
to hunt buffalo to feed these men...

01:53:43.265 --> 01:53:46.805
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?

01:53:46.975 --> 01:53:50.105
They're railroaders. I thought somebody
in the railroad might be interested.

01:53:50.265 --> 01:53:53.145
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.

01:53:53.315 --> 01:53:56.565
You should've buried them,
then tracked down the Indians who did it.

01:53:57.525 --> 01:54:00.025
Well, Mr. King, like you said,
I was hired to hunt...

01:54:00.195 --> 01:54:03.325
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.

01:54:03.485 --> 01:54:05.195
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.

01:54:05.365 --> 01:54:07.865
You wouldn't think a couple
dead men bother them much.

01:54:08.035 --> 01:54:11.915
I don't want anything in their thick skulls
but their work. Do you understand?

01:54:12.085 --> 01:54:15.125
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.

01:54:15.295 --> 01:54:20.005
You keep forgetting, Mr. King,
my job's buffalo.

01:54:21.965 --> 01:54:23.805
It was buffalo.

01:54:23.965 --> 01:54:26.345
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.

01:54:26.515 --> 01:54:28.935
Well, now, that foreman fella,
you didn't fire him.

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:31.895
You just took him down a peg
because you needed him.

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:34.025
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?

01:55:06.555 --> 01:55:09.225
- What the devil is that?
- Milk.

01:55:09.385 --> 01:55:11.225
Milk?

01:55:11.555 --> 01:55:14.105
The Army must've changed
since I was in it.

01:55:14.265 --> 01:55:18.065
- Just rode in. I'm hungry.
- You are, huh?

01:55:18.895 --> 01:55:21.405
But you'd rather watch them than eat.

01:55:21.565 --> 01:55:23.235
- Is that it?
- That's it.

01:55:23.405 --> 01:55:26.825
Well, I wish you were as eager
to protect this railroad.

01:55:26.995 --> 01:55:30.075
Did you get any word about those two men
who were killed today?

01:55:30.245 --> 01:55:33.285
I tracked the Arapahos
and talked to the chief.

01:55:33.455 --> 01:55:35.545
Those men were a mile off
the right-of-way...

01:55:35.705 --> 01:55:38.795
...where they had no business,
drunk and chasing squaws.

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:42.675
- As much their fault as it was the Indians'.
- That a fact?

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:47.175
Well, soldier boy, your job
is to fight Indians, not to agree with them.

01:55:47.345 --> 01:55:51.805
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahos
and I had 20 men.

01:55:51.975 --> 01:55:53.725
Now, to me...

01:55:53.895 --> 01:55:55.935
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.

01:55:56.105 --> 01:55:58.065
To you, huh?

01:55:58.225 --> 01:56:01.855
Well, you know, I might just send off
a wire to the colonel.

01:56:02.105 --> 01:56:04.275
He may not agree.

01:56:05.315 --> 01:56:08.075
I already reported. He does agree.

01:56:41.275 --> 01:56:44.065
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.

01:56:44.235 --> 01:56:45.655
Trouble, sir?

01:56:51.155 --> 01:56:52.655
I don't know.

01:56:52.825 --> 01:56:54.665
Hey, lieutenant.

01:56:56.745 --> 01:56:58.835
I got a message:
Indians are up to something.

01:56:58.995 --> 01:57:00.755
You know anything about it?

01:57:01.085 --> 01:57:03.665
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.

01:57:03.835 --> 01:57:07.175
Changed the route, come smack
through Arapaho hunting grounds.

01:57:07.345 --> 01:57:09.755
- You sure the chief's right?
- Plenty sure.

01:57:09.925 --> 01:57:12.175
They're getting the war paint ready.

01:57:15.895 --> 01:57:17.765
Can you stand there and tell me...

01:57:18.105 --> 01:57:21.815
...that one little change is gonna cost
the Arapahos one buffalo.

01:57:21.975 --> 01:57:24.315
- Or even one jackrabbit?
- Mr. King.

01:57:24.485 --> 01:57:27.815
They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting them?

01:57:27.985 --> 01:57:31.035
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.

01:57:31.865 --> 01:57:35.325
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.

01:57:35.495 --> 01:57:38.325
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off
their herds.

01:57:38.495 --> 01:57:40.165
And then the settlers coming in.

01:57:40.335 --> 01:57:43.205
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?

01:57:43.375 --> 01:57:45.545
By then, we'll all be dead.

01:57:45.715 --> 01:57:47.885
Right now we're just crossing the land.

01:57:48.045 --> 01:57:51.715
That's all. Land that's safe
to the Arapahos for our lifetime.

01:57:51.885 --> 01:57:53.055
Now, you go talk to them.

01:57:53.215 --> 01:57:56.185
Smoke a peace pipe with them.
Do anything they want.

01:57:56.345 --> 01:57:58.555
Just get them to make a new agreement.

01:58:00.435 --> 01:58:03.645
That's your job, isn't it?
Keeping the peace?

01:58:05.355 --> 01:58:07.485
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...

01:58:07.655 --> 01:58:10.025
...but you keep your promise.

01:58:18.535 --> 01:58:20.585
Hear your name's Rawlings,
you're from Ohio.

01:58:20.745 --> 01:58:24.085
Your pa's name couldn't be
Linus Rawlings, could it?

01:58:24.255 --> 01:58:25.915
- Could be.
- Knew him.

01:58:26.085 --> 01:58:27.465
Jethro Stuart.

01:58:27.625 --> 01:58:30.255
- He used to speak of you.
- Used to?

01:58:30.425 --> 01:58:32.635
Pa was killed at Shiloh.

01:58:33.305 --> 01:58:35.595
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.

01:58:36.595 --> 01:58:38.345
Well, better than dying behind a plow.

01:58:39.145 --> 01:58:42.435
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.

01:58:42.605 --> 01:58:44.775
Took 10 years off my life.

01:58:47.235 --> 01:58:48.945
Your ma...

01:58:49.405 --> 01:58:54.195
She must've been something real special
getting old Linus to stay put.

01:58:54.365 --> 01:58:57.955
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.

01:58:58.115 --> 01:58:59.785
Old Linus.

01:58:59.955 --> 01:59:02.495
Two years running once.
Your pa and me trapped together.

01:59:02.665 --> 01:59:04.585
Up along the Waunakee.

01:59:04.745 --> 01:59:07.295
Got so many beaver,
we had to tie them tail-to-tail...

01:59:07.465 --> 01:59:09.375
...just to drag them down the mountain.

01:59:09.545 --> 01:59:12.635
Over a mile long it was,
that line of beaver pelts.

01:59:12.795 --> 01:59:17.135
Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth
and stretch it about six ways.

01:59:17.305 --> 01:59:19.385
You sound just like him.

01:59:20.345 --> 01:59:22.895
I'll take it you meant that kindly.

01:59:23.055 --> 01:59:26.105
Well, I'd think twice
before I called you a liar.

01:59:26.275 --> 01:59:29.025
Tell me something,
talking about liars.

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:33.945
Why would a son of old Linus
get mixed up with a man like Mike King?

01:59:34.825 --> 01:59:36.325
I know what you mean.

01:59:36.485 --> 01:59:39.495
- But Mike King isn't the railroad.
- Oh?

01:59:39.655 --> 01:59:41.825
I don't think he knows that.

01:59:41.995 --> 01:59:44.455
He's changing the route back, is he?

01:59:44.625 --> 01:59:46.085
No.

01:59:46.995 --> 01:59:48.005
I know.

01:59:48.165 --> 01:59:51.175
But he'd do anything
to gain a day on the Central Pacific.

01:59:51.335 --> 01:59:55.965
He's not a fool. He doesn't want a war,
and neither do the Arapahos.

01:59:56.675 --> 01:59:59.515
I think I could get them to agree
to this change in route...

01:59:59.675 --> 02:00:01.845
...if I sit down and talk with them
for a while.

02:00:02.015 --> 02:00:04.685
- How you gonna get them to do it?
- That's just it.

02:00:04.855 --> 02:00:08.145
I need somebody that knows
the language and who they trust.

02:00:09.355 --> 02:00:12.735
You wouldn't happen to know someone
like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?

02:00:15.775 --> 02:00:20.245
Your pa could set a trap
like no man I ever come across.

02:00:20.405 --> 02:00:23.415
Just coax them on and, bam.

02:00:40.555 --> 02:00:44.055
You'd better do something
so he'll know you're pledging your word.

02:01:30.015 --> 02:01:34.445
That blame whistle's like the crack of doom
for all that's natural.

02:01:34.605 --> 02:01:37.865
My ma felt a man ought to
make his scratch on the land.

02:01:38.025 --> 02:01:40.985
Leave it a little different
than when he come.

02:01:41.155 --> 02:01:43.825
Anyway, thanks for fixing things
with the chief.

02:01:43.995 --> 02:01:45.455
Me? I fixed nothing.

02:01:45.615 --> 02:01:48.625
You put the words to my mouth
but that won't make them come true.

02:01:48.785 --> 02:01:51.245
Jethro, I said what I had to
to keep the peace.

02:01:51.415 --> 02:01:53.375
- I know there's a risk.
- Risk?

02:01:53.545 --> 02:01:55.545
Maybe you don't understand.

02:01:55.715 --> 02:01:57.295
You pledged your word back there.

02:01:57.465 --> 02:01:59.965
Not mine, not the Army's,
not the railroad's.

02:02:00.135 --> 02:02:02.845
It's your word told them
they'd keep their hunting grounds.

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:05.725
- I think they will.
- I think you got your neck stuck out...

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:09.515
...like a prairie chicken waiting for one side
or the other to chop it off.

02:02:09.685 --> 02:02:12.605
Your pa and me got kicked out
of one territory after another...

02:02:12.775 --> 02:02:16.195
...with people pouring in,
killing off game, putting up towns.

02:02:16.355 --> 02:02:18.155
It ain't gonna stop.

02:02:18.315 --> 02:02:22.275
Your treaty's gonna get broke and
I don't wanna be around to see it happen.

02:02:22.825 --> 02:02:25.115
Look me up when you get your bellyful.

02:02:25.285 --> 02:02:27.535
- Where you going?
- Heading back to the mountains.

02:02:27.705 --> 02:02:31.625
A high lonesome
where there ain't no people at all yet.

02:02:31.875 --> 02:02:33.625
So long.

02:02:40.675 --> 02:02:44.805
<i>By now, the Central Pacific had broken</i>
<i>through the wall of the high Sierras...</i>

02:02:44.965 --> 02:02:49.435
<i>... and was straining eastward</i>
<i>across the flatlands of Nevada.</i>

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:53.395
<i>While the Union Pacific,</i>
<i>thanks to its long peace with the Indians...</i>

02:02:53.565 --> 02:02:58.275
<i>... was able to keep up pressure</i>
<i>just as avidly in the opposite direction.</i>

02:03:12.955 --> 02:03:16.455
<i>The competition was exciting,</i>
<i>but also costly...</i>

02:03:16.625 --> 02:03:21.835
<i>... and both companies were itching</i>
<i>to earn money from tracks already laid.</i>

02:03:35.515 --> 02:03:38.275
Did the horses ride all right, Jake?
- No better than I did.

02:03:38.435 --> 02:03:42.405
We'll have to rest them a day before we can
start hunting rabbits, much less buffalo.

02:03:42.565 --> 02:03:44.695
Just get them to water right away.

02:03:44.865 --> 02:03:47.075
You say no buffalo hunter come.

02:03:47.235 --> 02:03:48.865
White man, liar.

02:03:49.035 --> 02:03:51.705
We scout for you no more.

02:03:57.545 --> 02:03:59.125
Not in our lifetime, you said.

02:03:59.295 --> 02:04:03.425
And there they are.
The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.

02:04:03.585 --> 02:04:06.215
All right, it's sooner than I figured.

02:04:06.385 --> 02:04:09.595
But the railroad's broke.
They need money to keep moving on.

02:04:09.765 --> 02:04:12.055
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.

02:04:12.225 --> 02:04:14.855
- It's as simple as that.
- What about the Arapahos?

02:04:15.015 --> 02:04:18.895
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.

02:04:19.065 --> 02:04:21.195
They'll have a rough time,
but they'll make it.

02:04:21.355 --> 02:04:23.275
And do you wanna know
why they'll make it?

02:04:23.445 --> 02:04:26.905
Because they're willing
to change their ways.

02:04:27.075 --> 02:04:30.115
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.

02:04:30.285 --> 02:04:33.165
I know they have to
and someday the land will be taken over...

02:04:33.325 --> 02:04:35.875
...by these farmers
with their towns and their cattle.

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:37.245
But not like this.

02:04:37.415 --> 02:04:40.835
They don't have to be double-crossed,
and I don't have to be a part of it.

02:04:41.005 --> 02:04:43.255
You don't, lieutenant?

02:04:43.425 --> 02:04:45.635
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?

02:04:45.795 --> 02:04:48.005
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it.

02:04:48.175 --> 02:04:51.475
If the Army hasn't got any authority
out here, I'm resigning. And now.

02:04:51.635 --> 02:04:53.805
I don't see how that's
gonna help the Arapahos.

02:04:53.975 --> 02:04:55.305
Nothing will help them.

02:04:55.475 --> 02:04:58.185
But nothing's gonna stop them.

02:05:28.385 --> 02:05:30.135
Indian attack!

02:05:30.305 --> 02:05:32.055
Indian attack! Take cover!

02:05:42.855 --> 02:05:44.235
Take a good look.

02:05:44.395 --> 02:05:48.115
You wanted a war and you got one.
I hope you're the first man killed in it.

02:05:48.275 --> 02:05:50.735
Turn those wagons over!

02:06:12.425 --> 02:06:14.555
Shoot for the lead horses.
Pick off the chief.

02:06:14.725 --> 02:06:16.935
Rawlings, try that.

02:06:26.275 --> 02:06:28.405
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.

02:06:28.565 --> 02:06:31.075
Dirty skunks. Come on.

02:08:47.705 --> 02:08:51.045
I told you there'd be no war.

02:08:51.215 --> 02:08:52.665
Look at them.

02:08:52.835 --> 02:08:54.925
They've quit.

02:08:55.085 --> 02:08:57.215
They'll be back.

02:08:57.595 --> 02:09:02.175
They just sent a bunch of animals
to kill an animal they call the "iron horse."

02:09:02.345 --> 02:09:04.725
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?

02:09:04.895 --> 02:09:06.975
And nothing's gonna stop it.

02:09:26.995 --> 02:09:29.745
You think you can live with that?

02:09:30.375 --> 02:09:32.835
I can live with it, or I can die with it.

02:09:33.005 --> 02:09:34.835
Just listen.

02:09:35.005 --> 02:09:37.425
You can live with that?

02:09:38.095 --> 02:09:39.255
That?

02:09:39.425 --> 02:09:41.175
That ain't crying.

02:09:41.345 --> 02:09:44.265
That's just new life going on.

02:09:49.515 --> 02:09:53.435
Pick up this woman and put the rest
of the injured in the tent house.

02:09:57.945 --> 02:09:58.945
Hey, Merv...

02:09:59.115 --> 02:10:02.195
The rest of you, back to work.
We got a railroad to build.

02:10:55.415 --> 02:10:57.165
Well...

02:10:57.665 --> 02:11:00.005
Looks like you finally got your bellyful.

02:11:00.175 --> 02:11:02.095
Hello, Jethro.

02:11:02.635 --> 02:11:04.805
Appears you're doing well.

02:11:05.515 --> 02:11:07.345
Can't complain.

02:11:07.515 --> 02:11:11.725
Creek's loaded with beavers,
fighting their way into the trap.

02:11:11.895 --> 02:11:13.765
No white men looking
over my shoulder...

02:11:13.935 --> 02:11:16.525
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.

02:11:16.685 --> 02:11:19.525
Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.

02:11:19.695 --> 02:11:21.195
Thanks.

02:11:22.445 --> 02:11:23.615
You'll be bunking yonder.

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:26.535
Take your bearings now
so you can find it when you need it.

02:11:26.695 --> 02:11:29.575
If you don't like my snoring,
you can build your own cabin.

02:11:29.745 --> 02:11:31.915
I'll furnish the ax.

02:11:33.455 --> 02:11:36.835
- Thanks. I'm just passing through.
- Through to where?

02:11:37.005 --> 02:11:39.125
Anywhere you go is like
where you've been.

02:11:39.295 --> 02:11:41.545
Ain't you lost enough tail feathers
back there?

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:45.675
I've been plucked some.

02:11:46.595 --> 02:11:48.555
But that's what I like about this country.

02:11:48.725 --> 02:11:51.685
There's always greener grass
over the next hill.

02:11:51.845 --> 02:11:54.685
Not no more.
Not since that damn railroad come.

02:11:54.855 --> 02:11:58.395
All the grass is being staked out now,
with a lock on it.

02:12:00.565 --> 02:12:04.155
Maybe I'll just have to climb
a little higher hill to find it.

02:12:07.075 --> 02:12:08.575
How about coming along?

02:12:08.745 --> 02:12:10.825
You crazy?

02:12:10.995 --> 02:12:14.745
Like the Indians say, "These rocks
and trees around here feel no call to move."

02:12:14.915 --> 02:12:16.495
Why should I?

02:12:17.585 --> 02:12:19.915
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.

02:12:20.085 --> 02:12:22.925
But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.

02:12:23.085 --> 02:12:26.255
Man belongs his own kind,
like him or not.

02:13:02.375 --> 02:13:06.635
<i>The coming of railroads brought changes</i>
<i>in the land through which they passed.</i>

02:13:06.795 --> 02:13:10.465
<i>Now immense herds of cattle were driven</i>
<i>hundreds of miles to meet the lines...</i>

02:13:10.635 --> 02:13:12.475
<i>... bound for markets in the East.</i>

02:13:13.015 --> 02:13:16.185
<i>Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...</i>

02:13:16.475 --> 02:13:20.225
<i>... and a long and bloody wrangle began</i>
<i>between cattlemen and homesteaders.</i>

02:13:20.815 --> 02:13:24.905
<i>The law was in the hands of whoever</i>
<i>could shoot fast and straight...</i>

02:13:25.065 --> 02:13:29.275
<i>... except where there was somebody</i>
<i>determined to stand for law.</i>

02:13:29.445 --> 02:13:33.205
<i>Others might look on sheep and a shepherd</i>
<i>as a pastoral scene.</i>

02:13:35.915 --> 02:13:37.375
<i>Not the cattleman.</i>

02:13:37.535 --> 02:13:43.125
<i>To him, sheep destroyed grass,</i>
<i>and grass came dear.</i>

02:13:43.295 --> 02:13:45.925
<i>And if a man's life were held cheaper</i>
<i>than grass...</i>

02:13:46.085 --> 02:13:50.095
<i>... it was considered a casualty of war,</i>
<i>not a crime.</i>

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:55.975
<i>And, in all this, the man with the star</i>
<i>was only one against many.</i>

02:13:56.385 --> 02:13:59.185
<i>But time was running out</i>
<i>for the reckless ones...</i>

02:13:59.355 --> 02:14:03.025
<i>... the desperadoes,</i>
<i>the gallop-and-gunshot boys...</i>

02:14:03.185 --> 02:14:05.985
<i>... as more and more citizens demanded</i>
<i>respect for the law...</i>

02:14:06.145 --> 02:14:09.025
<i>... and showed themselves ready to fight</i>
<i>to uphold it.</i>

02:14:09.195 --> 02:14:12.535
<i>And the raw new towns that sprung up</i>
<i>in the West began to dream...</i>

02:14:12.695 --> 02:14:17.455
<i>... of becoming as refined as that one-time</i>
<i>hooligan city by the Golden Gate.</i>

02:14:17.615 --> 02:14:19.915
<i>San Francisco was now respectable.</i>

02:14:20.085 --> 02:14:24.045
<i>So sophisticated, in fact,</i>
<i>it even had mansions up for auction.</i>

02:14:24.205 --> 02:14:25.875
Two thousand dollars.

02:14:26.045 --> 02:14:28.045
Two thousand dollars.

02:14:28.215 --> 02:14:30.295
Is that your last bid?

02:14:30.465 --> 02:14:35.055
Ladies and gentlemen,
this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.

02:14:35.225 --> 02:14:40.185
"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president.
San Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."

02:14:40.355 --> 02:14:43.105
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.

02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:47.195
Do I hear $3000
for this priceless possession?

02:14:47.355 --> 02:14:49.735
Priceless, my foot.

02:14:49.905 --> 02:14:52.235
We used it for a doorstop.

02:14:52.735 --> 02:14:55.245
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.

02:14:55.405 --> 02:14:57.245
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

02:14:57.405 --> 02:15:00.075
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.

02:15:00.785 --> 02:15:02.915
It's a sad day, Lilith.

02:15:03.085 --> 02:15:04.585
Sad?

02:15:04.745 --> 02:15:07.415
We made and spent
three fortunes together.

02:15:07.585 --> 02:15:09.585
What's so sad about that?

02:15:09.755 --> 02:15:13.425
And if he'd lived a little longer,
we would've made and spent another.

02:15:13.715 --> 02:15:15.845
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
- What?

02:15:16.015 --> 02:15:17.975
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.

02:15:18.135 --> 02:15:20.805
Well then, take it.
Quit apologizing and take it.

02:15:20.975 --> 02:15:22.225
Thank you, madam.

02:15:22.395 --> 02:15:24.935
If there'd been some other way
to pay off the debts...

02:15:25.105 --> 02:15:26.395
It doesn't matter.

02:15:26.565 --> 02:15:30.025
I've got two things
no one can ever take from me:

02:15:30.695 --> 02:15:34.235
This and my land in Arizona.

02:15:34.405 --> 02:15:37.365
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...

02:15:37.535 --> 02:15:39.745
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.

02:15:39.915 --> 02:15:41.415
Well, it's there, isn't it?

02:15:41.575 --> 02:15:44.455
Yes, but most of the cattle
have been sold off or stolen.

02:15:44.625 --> 02:15:47.125
- I'll get cattle.
- You'll need someone to work it.

02:15:47.295 --> 02:15:49.625
- Someone to manage it for you.
- I'll get that too.

02:15:49.795 --> 02:15:50.925
Who?

02:15:51.085 --> 02:15:55.135
My nephew.
He's a marshal out there somewhere.

02:15:55.305 --> 02:15:59.055
Now, Lilith, at your age,
it might be kind of rough.

02:15:59.635 --> 02:16:01.225
Rough?

02:16:01.385 --> 02:16:06.185
My ma and pa were killed
going down the river just looking for land.

02:16:06.775 --> 02:16:10.985
I guess I got a little of that Prescott blood
in me after all.

02:16:19.865 --> 02:16:20.905
Pa?

02:16:21.495 --> 02:16:25.495
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill
as high as that?

02:16:26.835 --> 02:16:28.375
I don't know, son.

02:16:28.545 --> 02:16:32.375
On our way home, you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.

02:17:21.135 --> 02:17:23.725
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?

02:17:23.885 --> 02:17:25.395
- What?
- You aunt Lilith.

02:17:25.555 --> 02:17:28.225
- Do you think you'll recognize her?
- Sure.

02:17:28.395 --> 02:17:31.735
Zeb? What's the matter?

02:17:32.105 --> 02:17:33.395
Nothing.

02:17:33.565 --> 02:17:35.065
Come on.

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:42.575
Thank you.

02:17:47.875 --> 02:17:51.915
- Ma'am, are you our great-aunt Lilith?
- If you're Zeb's children, I am.

02:17:54.875 --> 02:17:57.545
- Lilith.
- Zeb.

02:17:58.594 --> 02:18:01.094
Zeb Rawlings.

02:18:01.254 --> 02:18:02.764
Oh, goodness.

02:18:02.924 --> 02:18:05.764
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.

02:18:06.094 --> 02:18:09.475
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.

02:18:09.645 --> 02:18:11.895
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.

02:18:12.065 --> 02:18:13.485
Pleased to meet you.

02:18:13.645 --> 02:18:15.895
I'm pleased to meet you too.

02:18:16.065 --> 02:18:19.275
I just can't tell you how pleased.

02:18:19.445 --> 02:18:22.285
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.

02:18:22.445 --> 02:18:24.615
- Come on and meet Sam now.
- Sam?

02:18:24.785 --> 02:18:28.285
Sam's our horse.
He could pull two wagons if he wanted.

02:18:28.455 --> 02:18:32.245
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet Sam.

02:18:32.415 --> 02:18:33.455
Come on.

02:18:33.955 --> 02:18:36.715
- Oh, just a minute now, boys.
- But he's on the other side.

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:38.334
Come on.
Okay.

02:18:38.504 --> 02:18:39.885
Come on.
Just a minute.

02:18:40.045 --> 02:18:42.254
I think this means a whole lot to her.

02:18:42.424 --> 02:18:44.885
You have no idea how much
it means to me...

02:18:45.055 --> 02:18:48.975
...to be able to settle down
to a life of peace and quiet.

02:18:49.145 --> 02:18:50.555
I'll get the luggage.

02:18:53.855 --> 02:18:55.895
Hello, boys.

02:18:56.065 --> 02:18:57.815
Jake.

02:18:58.145 --> 02:18:59.235
Tom.

02:18:59.405 --> 02:19:01.115
Pablo.

02:19:11.325 --> 02:19:13.745
Zeb. Let's go.

02:19:13.915 --> 02:19:20.004
Now, marshal, don't tell me you come
all the way to Gold City just to meet me?

02:19:20.174 --> 02:19:22.754
I hardly expected it.

02:19:23.174 --> 02:19:27.135
And the beautiful... Mrs. Rawlings?

02:19:27.305 --> 02:19:29.264
What a pleasure.

02:19:29.434 --> 02:19:33.764
I envy you, marshal.
A well-favored, bright-eyed wife...

02:19:33.934 --> 02:19:37.775
...just as dazzling as that sun up there.

02:19:38.695 --> 02:19:41.105
Makes you almost thankful, don't it?

02:19:41.275 --> 02:19:43.945
It makes a person wanna live.

02:19:50.285 --> 02:19:51.875
That's Charlie Gant.

02:19:52.035 --> 02:19:54.415
I thought you said he was in Montana.

02:19:54.585 --> 02:19:56.245
Zeb?

02:19:56.415 --> 02:19:59.215
I'm just gonna get the luggage, that's all.

02:20:08.305 --> 02:20:09.885
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?

02:20:10.055 --> 02:20:12.685
- Prescott, take care of the horses.
- Yes, sir.

02:20:12.845 --> 02:20:16.265
- Linus, help your mother.
- Yes, sir.

02:20:22.565 --> 02:20:24.615
Anything wrong, Julie?

02:20:24.775 --> 02:20:27.445
No. No, nothing.

02:20:27.615 --> 02:20:29.745
Come on, Eve.

02:20:36.085 --> 02:20:38.585
- Lou.
- Zeb.

02:20:38.755 --> 02:20:40.255
Got a minute?

02:20:40.415 --> 02:20:42.425
Of course I got a minute.

02:20:44.215 --> 02:20:45.715
Here.

02:20:45.885 --> 02:20:48.425
Now, I urge you,
most respectfully to peruse the...

02:20:48.595 --> 02:20:51.225
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

02:20:51.595 --> 02:20:53.935
Well, what can I do for you?

02:20:55.435 --> 02:20:56.765
Go ahead, name it.

02:20:56.935 --> 02:20:59.775
I saw Gant get off the train this morning.

02:20:59.935 --> 02:21:02.485
There were three men waiting for him.

02:21:05.565 --> 02:21:08.025
That's why you're here, huh?

02:21:08.535 --> 02:21:10.405
That's it.

02:21:12.405 --> 02:21:14.785
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...

02:21:14.955 --> 02:21:19.545
...to keep Charlie Gant from going
where he wants to in this territory.

02:21:20.335 --> 02:21:24.045
I know. I know what he was...

02:21:24.295 --> 02:21:26.465
...but that's over now.

02:21:26.925 --> 02:21:29.345
It was over the day his brother got...

02:21:31.265 --> 02:21:34.305
Should've killed them both
that day, but...

02:21:34.805 --> 02:21:38.015
Well, you didn't.
There ain't a thing I can do about it now.

02:21:38.185 --> 02:21:40.935
What's he doing here, Lou?
Ain't you even curious?

02:21:41.105 --> 02:21:44.605
Well, what do you want me to do?
Run him out of town at the point of a gun?

02:21:44.775 --> 02:21:47.315
Do you think we still put the law
inside a holster here?

02:21:47.485 --> 02:21:50.575
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:53.995
With all its writs and decrees and...

02:21:54.495 --> 02:21:58.165
- We abide by that circuit judge now.
- How many get killed meantime?

02:21:58.325 --> 02:22:00.245
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's going to.

02:22:00.415 --> 02:22:03.665
Doc Holliday, the Clantons, the Youngers...

02:22:04.125 --> 02:22:08.175
- They're all gone now.
- Charlie Gant ain't gone.

02:22:09.135 --> 02:22:12.135
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.

02:22:12.385 --> 02:22:16.225
Lou? They want three guards in the wagon
with the gold shipment tomorrow.

02:22:16.385 --> 02:22:21.015
- Three?
- This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.

02:22:21.185 --> 02:22:24.105
I'll take Clayton and Sims with me,
all right?

02:22:28.615 --> 02:22:30.115
Well?

02:22:30.275 --> 02:22:32.155
Well what?

02:22:32.365 --> 02:22:34.495
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

02:22:34.655 --> 02:22:38.035
- It means we put on a three-man guard.
- To the train.

02:22:38.205 --> 02:22:40.375
What happens then?

02:22:40.535 --> 02:22:43.125
You know there's gold going out here
every month or so.

02:22:43.295 --> 02:22:46.915
There hasn't been a train robbery
since Jesse James was killed.

02:22:47.875 --> 02:22:50.885
Now, if the councilors
wish to have a conference, we'll have one.

02:22:51.045 --> 02:22:52.555
Zeb.

02:22:54.015 --> 02:22:57.975
I don't want any trouble here now.
We've been friends a long time.

02:22:58.685 --> 02:23:00.765
As a friend...

02:23:00.935 --> 02:23:02.975
...I'd like you to leave town.

02:23:25.125 --> 02:23:27.415
Boys, get back from there.

02:23:30.335 --> 02:23:32.095
Look down there, son.

02:23:32.255 --> 02:23:34.805
- Do you know how deep that shaft is?
- Uh-uh.

02:23:34.965 --> 02:23:36.845
That's a thousand foot deep.

02:23:37.015 --> 02:23:38.595
Do you know how deep
a thousand foot is?

02:23:38.765 --> 02:23:39.765
Uh-uh.

02:23:39.935 --> 02:23:44.105
Well, if you had 200 brothers,
all standing on your shoulders...

02:23:44.265 --> 02:23:48.275
...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.
- I'd be squished.

02:23:48.435 --> 02:23:52.025
Come on.
I'll show you boys the donkey engine.

02:23:57.285 --> 02:24:00.575
You boys go ahead.
I'll be along in a minute.

02:24:03.285 --> 02:24:06.795
I hear you've been talking
to the local marshal about me.

02:24:08.625 --> 02:24:12.755
- Would you call that friendly?
- I never considered us exactly friendly.

02:24:13.175 --> 02:24:15.345
I don't like you, marshal.

02:24:15.505 --> 02:24:19.385
I don't like what you and your kind
are doing to this country.

02:24:19.885 --> 02:24:21.765
Now, I don't want any trouble.

02:24:21.935 --> 02:24:26.435
But you wanna put things on the old basis,
just you and me?

02:24:26.605 --> 02:24:28.935
That's fine.

02:24:29.105 --> 02:24:32.155
I'm not gonna
get in a fight with you, Gant.

02:24:32.985 --> 02:24:35.575
It's peace you want, huh, marshal?

02:24:35.735 --> 02:24:37.155
Peace?

02:24:37.325 --> 02:24:40.155
There's only one kind I know of.

02:24:40.865 --> 02:24:43.035
That's the kind my brother's got.

02:24:43.285 --> 02:24:46.995
What happened to your brother
didn't teach you very much, did it?

02:24:47.165 --> 02:24:49.505
Easy, marshal.

02:24:49.795 --> 02:24:51.505
Floyd never made mistakes...

02:24:51.665 --> 02:24:54.885
...except the one time he trusted you.

02:24:55.045 --> 02:24:56.925
And you're the one that got away.

02:25:00.725 --> 02:25:03.975
One of these days, I'm likely
to pay you Rawlingses a little visit.

02:25:31.085 --> 02:25:33.295
Come on, move along.

02:25:33.465 --> 02:25:35.795
Get those gold boxes up there.

02:25:35.965 --> 02:25:38.095
That's a lot of gold.

02:25:38.255 --> 02:25:40.845
Come on, keep moving, boys.

02:25:43.225 --> 02:25:44.555
Zeb?

02:25:44.725 --> 02:25:47.015
Lou Ramsey's here.

02:25:48.935 --> 02:25:50.565
Lou.

02:25:51.185 --> 02:25:54.025
- I warned you, Zeb.
- What is it?

02:25:54.195 --> 02:25:56.485
Gant came to see me last night.

02:25:56.655 --> 02:25:59.615
Said you tried to start
some trouble with him.

02:25:59.775 --> 02:26:01.365
You believe him?

02:26:01.535 --> 02:26:04.785
I'm telling you, Zeb,
you take your trouble to your own territory.

02:26:04.955 --> 02:26:06.495
I don't want any more of it here.

02:26:09.745 --> 02:26:13.415
There won't be any more trouble, Lou.
Gant's gone.

02:26:13.585 --> 02:26:16.045
Rode out of here early this morning.

02:26:16.335 --> 02:26:17.425
With who?

02:26:17.585 --> 02:26:19.425
His gang.

02:26:19.925 --> 02:26:24.385
They should be somewhere
between here and Kingman...

02:26:24.555 --> 02:26:25.765
...waiting on that train.

02:26:26.265 --> 02:26:28.015
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.

02:26:28.185 --> 02:26:30.895
You are not looking for a robbery,
you're looking for Gant.

02:26:31.065 --> 02:26:34.275
You still carry lead where he shot you.
That was Texas.

02:26:34.435 --> 02:26:37.775
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd.
And now this.

02:26:39.985 --> 02:26:42.025
I'm sorry, Julie...

02:26:42.195 --> 02:26:45.745
...but I don't want my office
to be any part of this.

02:26:55.585 --> 02:26:56.625
Zeb?

02:26:56.795 --> 02:26:59.255
The boys have got the team hitched.

02:26:59.755 --> 02:27:01.175
I know.

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:03.505
It's almost time to go.

02:27:07.555 --> 02:27:09.305
Zeb?

02:27:33.165 --> 02:27:36.085
- Julie.
- No one's asking you to face Gant.

02:27:36.255 --> 02:27:38.005
No one's making you.

02:27:38.165 --> 02:27:41.255
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.

02:27:45.005 --> 02:27:48.475
Maybe there's
something you haven't told me.

02:27:48.975 --> 02:27:50.845
Is there, Zeb?

02:27:54.855 --> 02:27:57.775
I'm asking you not to go.

02:27:58.435 --> 02:28:00.195
Please.

02:28:00.525 --> 02:28:02.945
Don't go.

02:28:04.115 --> 02:28:05.445
Sorry, Julie.

02:28:23.215 --> 02:28:29.055
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded
in a man than his sense of honor.

02:28:29.225 --> 02:28:32.975
They're all the same, every one of them.

02:28:33.145 --> 02:28:35.225
You take my Cleve now.

02:28:35.395 --> 02:28:37.855
Never could turn down a poker game.

02:28:38.025 --> 02:28:40.145
Felt duty-bound to go.

02:28:40.315 --> 02:28:42.855
Three nights running sometimes,
but he wouldn't quit...

02:28:43.025 --> 02:28:46.115
...not if his life depended on it. He...

02:28:47.615 --> 02:28:49.495
I guess it isn't very funny.

02:28:49.655 --> 02:28:51.285
Ma?

02:28:51.655 --> 02:28:52.705
Where's Pa?

02:28:52.865 --> 02:28:55.375
Out. That's where he is.
- What's the matter with Mom?

02:28:55.535 --> 02:28:58.335
Nothing's the matter.
Come on, now, in the other room.

02:28:58.495 --> 02:29:00.625
- What's the matter?
Come on, we're gonna play.

02:29:00.795 --> 02:29:02.425
That's a good girl. That's better.

02:29:02.585 --> 02:29:05.085
What's the matter with Mama?
- Nothing's the matter.

02:29:05.255 --> 02:29:06.385
Do you know any games?

02:29:06.545 --> 02:29:08.465
We know tag.
Musical chairs.

02:29:08.635 --> 02:29:10.385
- Ugh. Tag.
- I know hide-and-seek.

02:29:10.555 --> 02:29:12.265
Well, do you know how to play poker?

02:29:12.435 --> 02:29:13.435
- Poker?
- Poker?

02:29:13.595 --> 02:29:17.305
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.

02:29:17.565 --> 02:29:19.355
But we don't know how to play poker.

02:29:19.525 --> 02:29:21.855
Well, it's time you learned.

02:29:22.025 --> 02:29:25.695
First, we'll start off
with a little five-card stud.

02:29:44.125 --> 02:29:46.295
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.

02:29:46.465 --> 02:29:47.635
Your pistol too.

02:29:50.965 --> 02:29:52.845
Sorry, Lou.

02:29:53.225 --> 02:29:54.595
I just can't oblige.

02:30:04.105 --> 02:30:06.445
Thought the law wouldn't let you
use that anymore.

02:30:07.525 --> 02:30:09.155
I'll use it if I have to.

02:30:09.735 --> 02:30:12.995
I'm going out of here, Lou,
and I'm taking this with me.

02:30:13.495 --> 02:30:14.995
To kill Gant.

02:30:15.155 --> 02:30:17.115
That's what you think, isn't it?

02:30:17.285 --> 02:30:19.995
It's something personal
between him and me.

02:30:20.165 --> 02:30:22.505
Well, Lou, it could be...

02:30:22.665 --> 02:30:26.085
...if I settle down with my family
and wait for him to come.

02:30:26.255 --> 02:30:29.795
And he'll come
if I don't stop him here and now.

02:30:29.965 --> 02:30:33.515
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed,
breaking the law...

02:30:33.675 --> 02:30:37.515
...and then I'm gonna use the law
to put him away once and for all.

02:30:37.685 --> 02:30:38.935
The law, Lou.

02:30:39.395 --> 02:30:41.185
I'm gonna use the law...

02:30:41.355 --> 02:30:44.235
...but I haven't got much chance
without your help.

02:31:09.715 --> 02:31:11.345
How many men in the caboose?

02:31:11.505 --> 02:31:12.885
Just one brakeman.

02:31:13.055 --> 02:31:16.345
- Is he armed?
- No, never has been.

02:31:16.515 --> 02:31:18.725
I'll be in the express car.

02:31:24.435 --> 02:31:25.725
Thanks, Lou.

02:31:25.895 --> 02:31:29.735
Marshal?
There's some riders up ahead.

02:31:30.565 --> 02:31:32.905
I'll take a look.

02:31:52.795 --> 02:31:55.345
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!

02:31:55.505 --> 02:31:57.265
Open it up, wide open.

02:32:23.325 --> 02:32:24.785
Zeb!

02:32:24.955 --> 02:32:27.955
Come on. Come on.

02:32:47.855 --> 02:32:49.815
Everyone make it?
- Frenchy's horse fell.

02:32:49.985 --> 02:32:52.025
- I don't think he made it.
- Well, let's move.

02:32:52.195 --> 02:32:54.155
It's a long way from here to that gold.

02:32:54.315 --> 02:32:56.155
There's no danger. Just keep going.

02:33:14.505 --> 02:33:16.505
It's Rawlings.

02:34:47.345 --> 02:34:48.935
Back this train up!

02:34:49.095 --> 02:34:50.305
And fast!

02:37:17.285 --> 02:37:19.085
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?

02:37:19.245 --> 02:37:22.005
We got a long way to go, son.

02:37:22.165 --> 02:37:23.755
Here.

02:37:27.345 --> 02:37:29.515
Auntie, when we going to your house?

02:37:29.675 --> 02:37:31.885
Your daddy will decide
when we get to your home.

02:37:32.055 --> 02:37:33.595
Auntie, can we take Sam with us?

02:37:33.765 --> 02:37:36.605
I think Sam is taking us.

02:37:58.335 --> 02:38:00.955
Pa, how much further is it
to Aunt Lilith's ranch?

02:38:01.125 --> 02:38:04.505
Well, son, it's around the next bend,
the next bend...

02:38:04.675 --> 02:38:07.135
...and the valley beyond.
- Oh.

02:38:10.215 --> 02:38:13.725
- Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?
LINUS: That's our song.

02:38:13.885 --> 02:38:15.305
Your song?

02:38:15.475 --> 02:38:19.565
I sang that song
long before your pa was ever born.

02:38:24.065 --> 02:38:25.065
Come on.

02:38:31.195 --> 02:38:32.825
Zeb.

02:39:06.695 --> 02:39:13.195
<i>The West that was won by its pioneers,</i>
<i>settlers, adventurers is long gone now.</i>

02:39:13.365 --> 02:39:15.825
<i>Yet it is theirs forever.</i>

02:39:15.995 --> 02:39:20.575
<i>For they left tracks in history</i>
<i>that will never be eroded by wind or rain...</i>

02:39:20.745 --> 02:39:26.415
<i>... never plowed under by tractors,</i>
<i>never buried in the compost of events.</i>

02:39:27.005 --> 02:39:30.715
<i>Out of the hard simplicity of their lives,</i>
<i>out of their vitality...</i>

02:39:30.885 --> 02:39:33.385
<i>... their hopes and their sorrows...</i>

02:39:33.555 --> 02:39:35.555
<i>... grew legends of courage and pride...</i>

02:39:35.715 --> 02:39:39.555
<i>... to inspire their children</i>
<i>and their children's children.</i>

02:39:40.225 --> 02:39:42.645
<i>From soil enriched by their blood...</i>

02:39:42.805 --> 02:39:45.605
<i>... out of their fever to explore and build...</i>

02:39:45.775 --> 02:39:49.065
<i>... came lakes where once</i>
<i>were burning deserts...</i>

02:39:49.315 --> 02:39:52.735
<i>... came the goods of the earth,</i>
<i>mines and wheat fields...</i>

02:39:52.905 --> 02:39:55.365
<i>... orchards and great lumber mills...</i>

02:39:55.535 --> 02:39:58.865
<i>... all the sinews of a growing country.</i>

02:40:00.115 --> 02:40:04.085
<i>Out of their rude settlements,</i>
<i>their trading posts, came cities...</i>

02:40:04.245 --> 02:40:07.255
<i>... to rank among the great ones</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

02:40:07.415 --> 02:40:10.545
<i>All the heritage of a people</i>
<i>free to dream...</i>

02:40:10.715 --> 02:40:15.255
<i>... free to act,</i>
<i>free to mold their own destiny.</i>
