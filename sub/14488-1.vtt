13:34.397 --> 13:37.274
Bender!
Shut the hell up!

13:40.904 --> 13:42.488
(POWER SURGING)

13:44.073 --> 13:45.991
Bender!
Stop shutting the hell up!

13:46.242 --> 13:49.536
Right. Leela's back,
as if I care.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.746
(SARCASTICALLY) Whoo!

13:50.872 --> 13:52.956
All right, Leela!
(ALL CHEERING)

13:53.208 --> 13:54.208
(SIGHS)

13:54.292 --> 13:57.753
Thanks. It's so nice
to wake up and see...
(GASPS)

14:01.216 --> 14:02.799
Leela!
Leela?

14:02.884 --> 14:04.510
Leela?
Leela.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.928
How is this possible?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.555
And can you believe
she wore a tank top
to my funeral?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.182
Shut up!
We got to get
out of here!

14:13.102 --> 14:14.603
(ROARING)

14:16.397 --> 14:18.857
No, you shut up,
we got to get out of here.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.401
(ALL SCREAMING)

14:31.287 --> 14:32.579
Yeah, baby.
Come on!

14:34.499 --> 14:36.166
All aboard the party ship!

14:41.214 --> 14:43.882
There's no room for
two captains' butts
in this chair.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.051
There would be if you'd
taken a spin class

14:46.135 --> 14:48.178
instead of lounging around
in a coma!

15:00.233 --> 15:01.316
LEELA: This is crazy.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.903
It's like I'm looking at
an exact robot duplicate
of myself.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.947
That is what
you're looking at.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.031
Oh.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.533
How could you
do this, Fry?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.910
(STAMMERS)
Coma... Sad...

15:11.995 --> 15:14.663
I have to go.
This is just too freaky!

15:15.707 --> 15:18.750
Please don't
get upset, Leela.
She's nothing like you.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.503
I have to go.
This is just too freaky.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.761
I need cheering up,
Bender.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.514
I don't know,
do you want to go out
and party tonight?

15:32.599 --> 15:33.932
I hate partying.

15:34.017 --> 15:37.185
If only I didn't
have so much crunk
in my badonkadonk.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.937
Yeah. Come on, baby.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.481
Why does everything
I date run away?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.985
I love Leela,
always and forever,

15:45.069 --> 15:47.112
and if I loved
robot Leela, too,

15:47.196 --> 15:51.033
well, that's only 'cause
she had so much of
real Leela in her.

15:51.367 --> 15:56.204
I thought she loved me, too,
but, obviously,
I was wrong as usual.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.707
Wrong again.
You were right.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.293
Leela? Leela-Leela?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.628
Leela-Leela.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.463
I've been thinking, Fry.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.633
If I lost you,
I don't think I could
stand it, either.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.594
I'd probably build
a copy of you, too.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.723
As long as robo-Leela's
not a jealous type like me,
things will...

16:14.807 --> 16:16.975
I'll kill you,
you slut-clops!

16:17.060 --> 16:18.226
(EXCLAIMS)

16:18.311 --> 16:19.436
He's mine!

16:19.520 --> 16:20.979
Back off, missy!

16:21.064 --> 16:22.439
(BOTH GRUNTING)

16:28.404 --> 16:29.863
Somebody do something!

16:29.947 --> 16:31.365
Here, take this!

16:31.574 --> 16:33.325
A gun?
Do I really need to...

16:33.409 --> 16:35.243
Shoot her!
She's the robot!

16:35.328 --> 16:38.038
No! Shoot her!
She's the human!

16:38.122 --> 16:41.166
But how do I know
who's the human
and who's the robot?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.334
We just told you!

16:42.418 --> 16:43.585
Yeah, you idiot!

16:43.753 --> 16:48.298
Okay. Fine. If you're
going to be like that,
I'm not shooting anyone.

16:48.925 --> 16:49.925
(GROANS)

16:50.259 --> 16:53.428
Right between the lungs.
Man, that was close.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.013
(SCREAMS)

16:56.432 --> 16:58.058
(SCATTING)

17:00.520 --> 17:01.895
I'm a robot, too!

17:02.021 --> 17:05.691
Aha! That explains this
growth on your drive shaft!

17:05.775 --> 17:07.358
But how is this possible?

17:07.443 --> 17:10.028
Who knows? Oh, I do.

17:10.113 --> 17:14.366
Allow me to explain
what really happened
the day the ship crashed.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.375
I'll protect you, Leela.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.002
My love is stronger
than the vast majority
of explosions.

17:29.549 --> 17:34.302
FARNSWORTH: Fry did, in fact,
save Leela, though at
a terrible cost to himself.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.513
I tossed him
into the stem cells,

17:36.639 --> 17:40.892
but he just bubbled away
like phlegm on
a hot sidewalk.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.019
Leela was so distraught,

17:43.146 --> 17:46.148
she went all Blade Runner
and built a duplicate.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.234
Then, uploaded
Fry's personality

17:49.318 --> 17:51.737
from the urinal
surveillance tapes.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.238
I sure love Leela.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.619
FARNSWORTH: Alas,
in recreating Fry's
adorable jelly-belly,

17:59.704 --> 18:02.706
she had overstuffed him
with copper wadding.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.044
The inevitable
static discharge
electrocuted Leela,

18:08.129 --> 18:11.298
and destroyed
both of their
short-term memories.

18:11.674 --> 18:15.093
So that's why I'm so
amazed by these things
I already knew.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.303
FARNSWORTH: What could I do?

18:16.387 --> 18:18.555
I hung up Leela with
the other bone bags

18:18.639 --> 18:22.225
and went to procure
the final ingredient
for my stem cell brew.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.685
(FLY BUZZING)

18:27.231 --> 18:29.649
Professor, my Fry-fro
is all frizzy.

18:29.734 --> 18:30.901
My God!

18:30.985 --> 18:34.362
I can't believe
I'll never see that
particular Fry again.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.868
Hey, where's my shoes?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.119
(ALL GASPING)

18:41.204 --> 18:42.204
Fry?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.873
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize
I was already here.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.292
Wait, what's with
all the Leelas?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.668
Trust me, don't ask.

18:48.753 --> 18:49.795
Okay, dork.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.296
Listen, I'm going to
hit the urinal,

18:51.380 --> 18:52.756
maybe talk about
myself a little bit...

18:52.840 --> 18:55.467
Hang on. It's time
to sort things out.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.638
The truth is,
I love Fry. That Fry.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.307
And I love Leela.
Any Leela.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.267
We're robots,
and we're in love.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.186
Let's ditch
these meat jackets.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.148
Whoa! Cool!

19:12.026 --> 19:14.069
(IMITATING TERMINATOR)
Hasta la vista, wiener.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.405
(IMITATING TERMINATOR)
We'll be back, for our stuff.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.494
Why did their voices change?

19:22.578 --> 19:26.748
That's the one thing
we'll never truly understand.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.752
Uh, this is a bit awkward.
Or is it?

19:30.837 --> 19:34.464
I'm not sure.
I lost track around
the second robot.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.635
Well, you know how I feel.
I waited for you
for 1,000 years,

19:38.719 --> 19:40.345
I can wait a little longer.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.515

What a load a mush!
I've had it.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.606
Party, Bender!
Party for your life!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.483
No chance, high-pants!

19:53.568 --> 19:55.360
I'd rather die
and kill all of you

19:55.444 --> 19:58.071
than party for one
more millisecond!

It ain't like that!

20:31.814 --> 20:33.815
Geez. What does it take
to kill me?

20:37.486 --> 20:40.864
Bender, you blew out
your excess capacity.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.824
You're cured!

20:43.701 --> 20:47.037
Sweet mercy!
My hellish nightmare
is over!

20:47.121 --> 20:49.080
I never have to
party again.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.665
Well, that's that then.
