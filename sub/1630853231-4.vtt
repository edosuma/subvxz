00:24.942 --> 00:26.944
Baby, there's too many
white people in here,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.570
maybe that's why
he doesn't want to come out.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.155
Too many white people?

00:30.239 --> 00:31.782
She really liked Dr. Williams.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.367
Let's try to stay focused.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.954
I need you taking big,
deep breaths, Embia.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.372
Ambia.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.291
-Big breath in.
-Come on, you got it.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.253
-And go. One. Two.
-Go. Two. Come on.

00:44.336 --> 00:47.130
-Three. Four.
-Good. You got it. Let's go.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.924
-Five.
-Push. Push.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.929
Six, seven, eight, nine.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.813
Oh, my God. It's done. It's done.

01:02.896 --> 01:07.025
-Look at this healthy baby boy!
-Look, Mom!

01:07.109 --> 01:08.527
There you go, Mom.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.404
-Let's get him cleaned up.
-Good job, Mom.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.992
I'll come over there with him.
How's he doing?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.286
-One last thing.
-Look at him.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.121
-And…
-He's so cute.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.874
Barely a tear. Good job, Mom.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.169
I hate doing stitches after midnight,
so thank you.

01:25.836 --> 01:26.837
There you go.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.215
-Got a name picked out?
-Not one that we both agreed on.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.054
I feel something.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.723
Look at that. So cute.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.391
Excuse me?

01:39.474 --> 01:41.852
Epidural should last another few hours.

01:42.686 --> 01:46.315
-Is it tingling?
-No, more like a pressure.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.817
Well, sometimes
the hormones mess with your head a little.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.069
No, no, I'm telling you,
something's wrong.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.321
Just try to relax.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.114
-Greg.
-I'm taking a photo.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.450
-His feet are so cute.
-Please. Please. Please.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.119
Hey, Doctor, there's a lot of blood.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.246
Excuse me, you sh--
I think you should see this.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.748
It's always a bloodbath, isn't it?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.291
Blood pressure's dropping.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.002
Call up and tell them we're on our way
with a severe uterine atony.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.755
-What's wrong?
-What do you mean severe?

02:09.838 --> 02:12.257
You're hemorrhaging, and we need to
get the bleeding under control.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.051
I told you there was something wrong.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.261
You're taking her right now?

02:16.345 --> 02:18.180
I don't wanna leave my baby.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.015
-Okay, let's go.
-Set.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.226
-Three, two, one.
-Why are her eyes doing that? Honey!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.727
Can somebody tell me something?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.103
Clearing the halls.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.822
Hi.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.410
Good morning. Yeah. Hi.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.538
Look at you.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.249
Yeah, you ready to start the day?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.378
Good stuff. Good.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.507
Okay. Let's go see what we're doing.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.219
All right. You slept pretty good,
didn't ya?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.721
You got a good attitude today.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.434
Do you still want pancakes for breakfast?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.812
-Yes.
-You do? Okay.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.526
Look at you. I forgot
what you look like in real clothes.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.571
Me too. The skirt's a little bit tight,
but hopefully, no one will notice.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.114
-It looks great. You got him?
-Hello.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.448
Hi. Yes. Yes.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.617
Yes, yes, yes.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.494
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Mommy, pick me up.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.830
I can't, sweetheart.
I'm gonna feed your brother, okay?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.290
Are you gonna do drop-off today?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.916
Daddy's gonna do drop-off today.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.710
I want you to do drop-off.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.629
It's Mummy's first day back,
and I can't be late.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.381
But I want you.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.134
Remember when we talked about
Mummy going back to the office this week?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.219
I don't want you to go. Don't go.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.513
Hey. What am I, chopped liver, honey?

03:41.597 --> 03:43.056
-Would you? All right.
-Yeah, I got him.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.224
Here you go. Yeah.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.059
-All right. Come on, buddy.
-Okay. Hey. Come up.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.644
-Come on, my guy.
-Come here.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.938
All right. All right.

03:50.022 --> 03:54.443
How about I will do bedtime tonight, yes?

03:54.526 --> 03:57.571
And I'll read five books.
How's that sound?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.364
Yes? Go. Go get ready.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.661
That's a risky move, promising bedtime.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.663
They said they would go easy on me,
so it should be fine.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.416
Everything will be fine. I have
a whole team that I can delegate to,

04:09.499 --> 04:12.044
and they know that I can't travel
for at least two months.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.712
-You know I got this, right?
-Yes.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.797
I went on a website for the au pair.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.132
So you want me to take on a third kid?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.635
Not a kid. A teenager.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.429
And she's more mature,
and it's cheaper than a nanny.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.723
Why are you trying
to ruin my paternity leave?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.934
I'm excited to hang out with my guy here.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.269
I didn't have the time with Zoe,
so let me have it.

04:30.896 --> 04:31.939
Okay. All right.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.526
The schedule's on the fridge.
Just follow that.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.529
It's cool. I'm probably just
gonna take him to the movies all day.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.156
Honey, it's fine. It's not my first rodeo.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.950
Okay.

04:43.033 --> 04:47.788
If Zoe wants to wear pajamas to school,
please just let her. I really don't care.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.249
Really? I thought
we didn't negotiate with terrorists.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.376
Well, this terrorist is pissed with me
because I'm leaving,

04:52.459 --> 04:55.838
so if that's what's gonna make her feel
safe, then that's what we're gonna do.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.298
What-- Where is that-- Fuck.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.050
-I always can't…
-What?

05:00.926 --> 05:03.053
…find this little thing. Where is it?

05:03.929 --> 05:04.930
Here.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.476
-And hey, you look great, by the way.
-Okay.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.188
Thank you.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.273
Enjoy today.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.192
I'll try. I'll try.

05:17.276 --> 05:21.154
Very poetic, putting the sleep-deprived
mother on the mattress account.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.739
Made me laugh.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.284
Revenue and profits are down,
but, of course, no one really knows why.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.661
-Right.
-Hey, welcome back.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.789
Oh, thanks, Stan. And thank you
for the very sweet flowers you sent.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.583
Private equity and kids.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.878
God. I really don't know
how you ladies do it.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.672
Witchcraft mainly.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.593
Well, your team did a nice job
holding down the fort while you were gone.

05:42.676 --> 05:47.014
And Rodney here,
much stronger than we anticipated.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.391
Thank you, Stan.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.475
-All right.
-Bye, y'all.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.394
-Bye.
-Take care.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.188
"Much stronger than we anticipated."

05:54.271 --> 05:56.690
Yeah, I've always loved a good insult
masquerading as a compliment.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.109
We should be sitting down with the CEO.
Where is he?

05:59.193 --> 06:00.485
Trinity, North Carolina.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.529
Yeah, we were waiting
to see what worked for you

06:02.613 --> 06:06.158
or if you needed to spend some more time
with the baby before you left town.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.118
Sorry, it's ten o'clock.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.954
Right. Everybody out. Gotta pump.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.040
You can pump here.
I've seen my wife pump a million times.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.876
Rodney, if I wanted you to see my boobs,
you'd see my boobs.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.171
Aren't we all gonna see your boobs anyway?

07:14.768 --> 07:19.231
-"Unlucky dog named…"
-"…unlucky dog named…"

07:19.314 --> 07:21.483
-"B. Around--"
-"Around."

07:21.567 --> 07:22.734
Hi.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.027
-Hey, look.
-Mommy.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.989
-Hey. There you go.
-She waited up for you. Harvey did not.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.657
I'm so sorry. I--

07:28.740 --> 07:31.493
I tried to leave early, but then
a couple conference calls came in

07:31.577 --> 07:33.412
-that I had to take care of. I'm sorry.
-All right.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.790
Hey, how did today go? Oh, my goodness.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.168
Daddy picked me up early.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.377
Yeah, Ms. Molly called.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.922
-She had been crying for over an hour.
-Zoe.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.259
And then she was a real B-I-T-C-H
to her brother over dinner.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.887
Or he could just tell you himself.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.013
It's like he can smell me.

07:51.889 --> 07:52.931
Hey, come here.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.311
Daddy's gonna finish bedtime,
and I'm gonna come up afterwards

07:57.394 --> 07:59.479
and say good night
when I've fed Harvey, okay?

07:59.563 --> 08:00.564
All right?

08:01.273 --> 08:05.652
When you come home, you're supposed to
make things better, not worse.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.392
Can you look at this weird rash
thing on my tit, please?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.645
Are you actively trying to kill the mood?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.730
No, can you please look at it? Look.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.191
All right.

08:45.734 --> 08:49.571
It's not shingles, is it? It can't--
I can't get fucking shingles, can I?

08:49.655 --> 08:53.200
No, I think shingles are on your back.
They don't start on your boob.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.786
Well, maybe it's--
Is it maybe-- maybe Harvey?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.538
But I would have felt that if he bit me.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.705
-Yeah.
-You said he was teething.

08:58.789 --> 08:59.957
-He's teething, right?
-Yeah, look,

09:00.040 --> 09:03.627
I'm all for playing detective,
but you got about ten minutes left in ya.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.798
Do you really wanna spend that time
looking at weird rashes on the Internet?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.049
-No.
-Right?

09:09.132 --> 09:10.217
No, I don't wanna do that.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.221
-Where were we?
-Right.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.533
Mommy, I'm lonely. Come lie with me.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.160
I thought you put her to bed.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.245
I did.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.124
Okay.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.208
Thanks.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.092
Why can't you stay home like other moms?

09:52.176 --> 09:56.471
Well, because not all mums are the same.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.559
My sweetie, what are you doing?

10:01.185 --> 10:02.561
I wanna hold you.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.896
Well, you are holding me.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.148
I wanna hold your arm skin.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.401
Okay.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.793
Net IRR is positive, low risk.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.046
We're looking at a full return
in the next five years.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.298
Now, the next three pages
in your documents are metrics

10:31.381 --> 10:33.258
with a few different versions
of infographics

10:33.342 --> 10:36.261
because I finally learned how
to use Google Charts. Thank you, Vinay.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.641
…but we are looking
at additional liquidity,

10:40.724 --> 10:42.976
at least one to 1.2 billion.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.146
Now on to fund two.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.274
Ambia.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.194
Do you wanna talk about
what's going on in fund two?

10:53.487 --> 10:54.488
Yes.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.782
Yes, I do.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.078
The numbers, seem encouraging.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.913
What time's the car picking you up?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.666
-At 3:30 a.m.
-They couldn't find you a later flight?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.543
Well, everyone else flew in yesterday.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.546
I just didn't want to leave the kids
for two nights,

11:10.629 --> 11:14.132
so I tried to get an earlier--

11:14.216 --> 11:16.552
Oh, shit. Look.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.973
Hey, do you wanna take some drugs with ya?

11:21.557 --> 11:23.600
I can't. I'm breastfeeding.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.769
I was kidding. I was half kidding.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.105
What's it called?
Why don't you just, pump and dump?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.232
What? I'm not gonna waste milk
on a work trip.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.443
I'm-- I'm sorry. I hate traveling.

11:33.527 --> 11:37.573
I told them that I didn't wanna leave
for at least another two months.

11:38.323 --> 11:42.911
And now, if I say something,
well, I'm weak.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.540
Hey, when you get back,
why don't we go out? Get a sitter.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.208
I think we could both use a night off.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.753
Well, theoretically, that sounds lovely.

11:51.837 --> 11:52.838
Theoretically.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.925
Or we could just skip the dim sum
and go straight to couples therapy,

11:57.009 --> 11:58.302
our usual table.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.349
Carrie paid $7000 for our mattress.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.727
-Bloody hell.
-Oh, no, I was pissed at first.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.813
But when you figure it normally sleeps
two adults and two toddlers every night…

12:09.897 --> 12:12.441
Oh, yeah, sure. Per person, it's a steal.

12:17.154 --> 12:22.367
What this tells me is that it's 1955,

12:22.451 --> 12:24.620
that Black people don't buy mattresses

12:24.703 --> 12:27.247
and that white women wear silk pajamas

12:27.331 --> 12:28.665
and never ever do work in bed.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.544
All right, just be aware,

12:32.628 --> 12:35.339
Paul gets very sensitive
over their shitty marketing strategy.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.924
He called me about it this morning.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.968
That call should've come to me,
so maybe next time, redirect it.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.347
Don't be a jealous boyfriend.
There's plenty of CEO to go around.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.140
Look, we just tag team them at lunch.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.309
-Fine. Whatever you want.
-But can you do me one favor?

12:47.392 --> 12:48.852
Just eat some bread beforehand.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.730
This is a business lunch,
not a Mardi Gras.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.190
-What-- I'm fun.
-Just trying to help.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.734
-That is my value.
-I'm saying what I see because I care.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.111
For that, I'm buying
a very expensive Japanese whiskey…

12:58.195 --> 13:00.989
-If I didn't, I would never say anything.
-…which they probably don't have here.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.664
And the queen is back.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.708
You were so fucking mercenary.
Even I was afraid of you.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.210
Thank you. You know, I have to say,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.003
it feels good to be
in the driver's seat again.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.588
Hey, now that the band's back together,

13:16.672 --> 13:18.215
should we see
if this place has some booze?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.008
-We are definitely drinking.
-Yes.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.260
Ambia's buying.

13:23.053 --> 13:27.224
Is it sad that I'm enjoying myself
at this shitty airport hotel?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.184
Yes. You need to get out more. Yes.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.729
Says the guy with round-the-clock help
and a wife who doesn't work.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.690
Hey, that is her choice, okay?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.483
I'm a very feminist husband.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.235
-Bullshit.
-I work my ass off

13:38.318 --> 13:40.153
so that she doesn't have to do a thing.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.406
I don't think that's how feminism works,
really.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.950
-Well, okay. Fuck it.
-No.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.370
-I apologize, poor form.
-All right.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.872
-Cheers, milady.
-Cheers.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.836
Are you trying to take my job?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.886
-I don't know, am I?
-You tell me.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.432
-Maybe I'm just fucking with you.
-Why would you do that?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.142
Corporate intrigue. Drama.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.647
Relax.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.318
Yes, I enjoyed my time on the Iron Throne,

14:19.401 --> 14:22.654
but I definitely do not want your hours.
Those are brutal.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.077
Come on.
He can't manage bedtime without you?

14:29.161 --> 14:31.121
-He can, but I--
-But what? But what are you do--

14:31.205 --> 14:32.539
Look, give yourself a night off.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.292
Look at my phone, not even on.
You know why?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.629
Because I am away on business.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.885
Yes, look at that.
Welcome to freedom. Welcome.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.054
It's very easy for you
to talk about freedom

14:47.137 --> 14:49.973
when your body's not leaking milk
every two fucking hours.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.309
No, no, I don't have--
Oh, shit. It's happening.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.603
-No. No, no, no.
-Oh, yes.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.605
-Guys, no. We're not doing those.
-No, I can't.

14:57.814 --> 14:58.941
It's happening all right.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.275
-It's your call.
-Oh, no, okay.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.610
-We spent 300 bucks on songs--
-What?

15:01.693 --> 15:02.736
Total jukebox domination.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.863
Ambia. Ambia.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.618
Okay, all right. Fuck it.
I'll do it, okay?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.250
-That's garbage.
-Yes.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.085
One, two, three.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.839
Whoo!

15:29.346 --> 15:30.806
Yeah!

16:22.065 --> 16:24.067
…located just outside of Trinity,

16:24.151 --> 16:25.986
in a scintillating nook of the city,

16:26.778 --> 16:29.615
which combines the appeal of the city

16:29.698 --> 16:31.700
with the beauty
of its natural surroundings.

16:34.244 --> 16:38.207
Hi. I'm so--
I'm so sorry I missed your call.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.291
Is everything okay?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.919
Yeah. Harvey woke up with a fever, 104.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.671
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

16:44.755 --> 16:48.008
He wasn't able to sleep in his crib, so
I've been basically wearing him all day,

16:48.091 --> 16:49.218
but he's doing better now.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.304
Did you--
Did you take him to the pediatrician?

16:52.387 --> 16:53.680
Yeah, of course.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.808
And he said it was normal?

16:56.892 --> 17:00.145
And babies have high fevers all the time.

17:00.229 --> 17:01.396
I remember when Zoe was a baby--

17:01.480 --> 17:03.357
Yeah, hey, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna wake him.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.483
-I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?
-Wait, wait, wait.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.320
Do you want--
Do you want me to come home earlier?

17:09.404 --> 17:11.949
I can see if they can get me
an earlier flight.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.201
No, I want you
to pick up your fucking phone

17:14.284 --> 17:16.369
when I'm at home parenting both our kids.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.579
I think that's a pretty minimal thing
to ask.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.457
-I'm home.
-Go see Mom.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.877
Mommy, Harvey got a tooth.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.424
What? What is going on, kid?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.092
Hi, Zoe. It's okay.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.803
It's fine. Mummy's just got a couple
boo-boos on her neck and her face.

18:14.887 --> 18:16.388
-What happened?
-You didn't hurt anyone.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.140
You didn't bite me, so it's fine.

18:18.682 --> 18:22.603
Hey, you wanna give me a hug?
I've missed you.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.272
Hey, why don't you go upstairs,
watch a show?

18:25.355 --> 18:28.275
I'm gonna help Mommy with some Band-Aids,
and then we'll hang out, okay?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.110
And I'll see you really soon, okay?

18:33.155 --> 18:34.823
-What happened?
-I don't know.

18:34.907 --> 18:36.909
I woke up, and my neck and my face--

18:36.992 --> 18:39.661
Okay, can I see it? Can I just see it?
It's all over your cheek.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.413
Wait.

18:41.496 --> 18:45.292
Oh, my God. Did you eat anything weird?
Did you take anything?

18:45.375 --> 18:46.877
You think I did this to myself?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.086
I didn't say that.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.590
It really hurts. Like little, tiny daggers
coming out of my skin.

18:51.673 --> 18:52.799
-It's just--
-Can I see them?

18:52.883 --> 18:53.717
No.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.095
-I can get him.
-Can you?

18:57.679 --> 18:59.473
I'm not an invalid.
I can hold my own child.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.557
I--

19:01.058 --> 19:02.267
Is it contagious?

19:04.895 --> 19:06.188
I'll go wash everything.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.759
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but I think you should see a doctor.

19:35.843 --> 19:36.760
No, thank you.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.012
And if this was happening
to either one of the kids,

19:39.096 --> 19:41.723
we'd be at the ER in a heartbeat, right?
Just for the peace of mind.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.977
So I think we should talk to Dr. Murray
and see if she knows anybody.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.563
Dr. Murray's a marriage counselor.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.983
Yeah, which is, sort of, a doctor
who knows other sorts of doctors.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.401
You want me to see another therapist?

19:52.484 --> 19:54.820
It doesn't have to be a sign of weakness
to see a therapist.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.280
I never said it was.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.491
And to be fair, we didn't really go
to a couple's therapist.

19:59.575 --> 20:02.286
We went three times, and that was plenty.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.997
And to be honest, I'd rather spend
the money on my children's future

20:05.080 --> 20:06.623
than talking about my childhood.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.128
Look, hon, I know in your family,
or your culture,

20:11.211 --> 20:12.379
-therapy can--
-My culture?

20:12.462 --> 20:15.215
Okay, Jesus,
could you give me a break, please?

20:15.299 --> 20:18.177
Okay? All I know is that Jews have
no problem with therapists.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.803
We love therapists.

20:19.887 --> 20:22.264
And you are clearly under a lot of stress,

20:22.347 --> 20:25.309
and you are not helping anybody
by soldiering through this

20:25.392 --> 20:27.352
like some sort of a tortured superhero.

20:27.436 --> 20:28.645
Says the family martyr.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.230
How am I a martyr?

20:30.314 --> 20:33.358
If you wanna stay at home with the kids,
fine. Just don't rub it in my face.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.800
Am I missing something?

21:01.053 --> 21:03.639
Yeah, they moved up the board meeting
to the end of the week.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.433
Shit, I can't go to North Carolina
at the end of the week.

21:06.517 --> 21:09.019
It's-- It's Zoe's birthday.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.979
Well, we're just troubleshooting here--

21:11.063 --> 21:12.356
Oh, well, let's troubleshoot then.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.651
Well, obviously,
we need to figure out a way

21:15.734 --> 21:18.028
to build you some more time off.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.823
I don't need more time off,
Stan. I need to push a board meeting.

21:21.907 --> 21:24.284
Paul just wants a little more
face time with the team.

21:24.368 --> 21:26.537
-Stan feels like I can do that because I…
-Yeah.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.788
…currently have a working face.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.665
Shut up, Rodney.

21:29.748 --> 21:33.710
You've been fucking gunning for my job
since I got back, and it's disgusting.

21:33.794 --> 21:34.795
Really disgusting.

21:34.878 --> 21:38.715
And if you are pushing me out to replace
me with this ridiculous little man,

21:38.799 --> 21:42.970
well, I really don't think that's the kind
of PR you want for this firm. Do you?

21:43.053 --> 21:44.304
Okay, calm down.

21:44.388 --> 21:45.639
Stop it, Stan.

21:45.722 --> 21:49.017
The only person that's supposed to be
presenting you on this company is me.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.354
What's wrong?

22:10.789 --> 22:14.543
What the fuck is that?
Is that a fucking tooth?

22:37.232 --> 22:38.233
Fuck.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.446
If you're looking for the meeting,
you're heading in the right direction.

23:24.530 --> 23:25.864
-They just started--
-Don't touch me.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.492
I will sue you.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.869
The last time I was here, I almost died.

23:31.370 --> 23:34.248
Well then,
let's hope things go better this time.

23:42.673 --> 23:43.674
Just breathe.

23:50.097 --> 23:51.515
You're not supposed to be in here.

23:52.432 --> 23:53.517
I gave birth here.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.449
Please, come join us.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.536
No, I don't do mum groups,
and I don't do hospitals.

24:54.620 --> 24:55.954
I was just looking for the exit.

24:56.747 --> 24:57.831
Of course.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.085
What is this?

25:03.128 --> 25:06.173
Was there an outbreak?
Are we being quarantined?

25:06.256 --> 25:10.135
No. Why don't you tell us
what happened to you?

25:12.554 --> 25:13.722
When did the bites start?

25:18.936 --> 25:20.479
When I went back to work.

25:21.313 --> 25:22.397
And how was that?

25:28.028 --> 25:29.154
Hard.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.741
And why do you think that is?

25:37.287 --> 25:38.455
Because…

25:41.124 --> 25:47.256
I'm one of three women
at partner level at my company.

25:48.632 --> 25:54.471
And because my daughter hates it
when I leave,

25:56.098 --> 25:58.392
so when I'm around, she--

25:59.893 --> 26:04.898
she pinches
every piece of available skin I have.

26:07.234 --> 26:11.405
And because my husband resents me

26:12.406 --> 26:14.449
even though I know he's trying not to.

26:18.412 --> 26:22.875
And because I almost bled to death

26:23.458 --> 26:25.419
giving birth to my son.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.591
So now when I look at him…

26:38.807 --> 26:40.809
all I can see is…

26:44.730 --> 26:49.067
how I'll never be able to tell him
that his birth was beautiful

26:49.151 --> 26:53.113
because it was a fucking bloodbath.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.369
And it was a fight.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.956
Still is a fight.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.297
And every day I just feel…

27:13.050 --> 27:14.051
guilty.

27:15.928 --> 27:20.849
Yes, you're letting it eat you alive.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.075
I cannot fucking believe
that they brought you here.

27:38.158 --> 27:40.327
I'm sorry I didn't pick up the phone.
I was just with the kids.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.912
I should've picked up the phone.
I'm sorry.

27:41.995 --> 27:43.455
It's fine. I'm fine.

27:43.539 --> 27:45.916
No, you're not. You can't be here.
This place almost killed you.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.169
All I--
I can't have anything happen to you.

27:49.253 --> 27:51.046
I keep thinking about how
when you were on that table,

27:51.129 --> 27:52.923
I should've been next to you
the whole time.

27:53.006 --> 27:55.384
I should've screamed at that doctor
when she didn't listen to you.

27:56.385 --> 27:59.179
Please don't beat yourself up.
I'm afraid you'll never stop.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.223
Wanna sit down?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.601
Yeah.

28:09.106 --> 28:10.691
Your face looks a lot better.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.318
They give you steroids or something?

28:13.402 --> 28:17.406
No, went to a mums group.

28:18.490 --> 28:19.908
You hate moms groups.

28:19.992 --> 28:22.160
Yes. Yes, I do.

28:22.661 --> 28:25.914
And it was full of monsters.
Totally grotesque.

28:29.168 --> 28:30.669
-Can I have a cracker?
-Yes, you can.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.754
-Feel like I'm gonna faint.
-Yes, you can.
