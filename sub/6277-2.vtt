11:08.000 --> 11:09.667
The only problem is,

11:09.667 --> 11:12.250
it is at the exact same time

11:12.250 --> 11:15.250
as Audrey's Shirley Temple
audition in Burbank,

11:15.250 --> 11:16.458
the big one.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.959
(Mickey)
Oh, say no more.

11:17.959 --> 11:20.166
You think I'd let the star here
go begging for a ride?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.750
Oh, bless you.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.500
Okay, break a leg.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.959
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.333
Bye.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.667
We're gonna cruise
to the lot in style.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.333
(Randy)
Why ain't I surprised, Garth?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.083
(Garth)
What?

11:34.083 --> 11:35.500
(Randy)
You let some Fresno negroid
lay pipe in your old lady.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.959
He was Greek heritage,

11:36.959 --> 11:38.583
and that shit happened
before I met her.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.125
Where do you think them Greeks
get their coloring, bro?

11:41.125 --> 11:42.792
African migration.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.458
(Randy)
You rubbing dicks
with Kunta Kinte

11:44.458 --> 11:45.583
up in there, man.

11:45.583 --> 11:46.959
(Garth)
You're an asshole, man.

11:46.959 --> 11:48.458
- Let's head back.
- No, no, no.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.542
I'm good with
the Brotherhood guys.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.792
I give them
free legal advice.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.166
It's good.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.834
All right.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.875
Excuse me, sir.

12:02.875 --> 12:06.583
Get the fuck
off my bench.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.083
Motherfucker.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.625
(Garth)
What did you say?

12:09.625 --> 12:12.000
You stepping to me,
you fucking sub-human?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.417
Huh?

12:13.417 --> 12:14.667
Huh?

12:17.125 --> 12:20.000
[men shouting]

12:27.166 --> 12:29.333
(Randy)
Garthie got dropped
by a fucking ding!

12:29.333 --> 12:30.792
(man)
Oh, shit!

12:30.792 --> 12:32.208
(Randy)
White power, baby!

12:32.208 --> 12:34.166
[cheering]

12:34.166 --> 12:35.875
Make room.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.417
[knocking]

12:39.417 --> 12:40.834
- Hey.
- What's up?

12:40.834 --> 12:42.875
You know,
being here this morning,

12:42.875 --> 12:47.375
it made me realize I'd like
to get back into boxing.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.750
I boxed when I was younger.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.834
I think being fit's
good for my recovery.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.000
(Father Romero)
Wanted to know if I could
open up a membership.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.125
I got cash.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.375
Come on in.

12:57.792 --> 12:59.375
I'll get you set up.

13:01.959 --> 13:05.542
You just got to...

13:05.542 --> 13:08.583
put your name there,
and sign right there.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.959
So I guess since
you host the meetings,

13:14.959 --> 13:17.083
you've been coming
to SNAP for a long time.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.000
Does it help?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.375
Yeah, sure.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.917
It's been real helpful.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.917
Well, this'll cover
for two months.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.083
Thank you.

13:32.083 --> 13:37.083
Um...
I'll see you soon, Brandon.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.250
Okay.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.458
I want to ask you something.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.959
What's up?

13:55.959 --> 13:57.792
What am I to you?

13:57.792 --> 13:59.834
Come on, Lena,
not today.

13:59.834 --> 14:02.291
Do you see me as
your assistant or your intern?

14:02.291 --> 14:03.375
What's going on?

14:03.375 --> 14:04.959
You need more money
or something?

14:08.792 --> 14:11.458
No, I don't need
any more money, Ray.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.542
[phone ringing]

14:16.083 --> 14:17.250
Yeah.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.458
We're in the infirmary.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.250
He got into a fight.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.542
Doc's checking him out now.

14:21.542 --> 14:22.792
(Ray)
Where the fuck were you?

14:22.792 --> 14:24.125
Aren't you supposed to prevent

14:24.125 --> 14:25.625
this kind of thing
from happening?

14:25.625 --> 14:27.500
(Kevin)
It's handled.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.709
All right.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.625
Have that doctor call me
when he's done.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.166
What the fuck.

14:37.834 --> 14:42.500
Avi asked me
to come work with him.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.959
What's he offering?

14:44.959 --> 14:46.291
Sparkling water.

14:46.291 --> 14:48.000
[chuckles]

14:51.291 --> 14:54.166
And the chance
to be his partner.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.333
(Lena)
Told him I'd think about it.

14:58.917 --> 15:00.667
I guess you're gonna take it,
huh?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.667
What makes you
say that?

15:02.667 --> 15:05.917
Well, you wouldn't have told me
about it if you weren't.

15:10.208 --> 15:13.333
How are you sleeping?

15:13.333 --> 15:16.208
Nobody sleeps here.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.458
This thing with your legs,
is that new?

15:21.375 --> 15:22.625
Sit down.

15:29.709 --> 15:32.625
Parkinson's tends to progress
a little faster in here.

15:32.625 --> 15:36.709
You'll need a wheelchair
in a year or two.

15:36.709 --> 15:39.667
You want me to put you
on the disability list?

15:39.667 --> 15:41.583
Get you a cane?

15:41.583 --> 15:43.208
I don't need a cane.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.000
[sighs]

16:02.000 --> 16:03.792
God damn it, Conor.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.750
Conor?

16:15.750 --> 16:17.583
[knocking]

16:17.583 --> 16:20.208
[faint knocking]

16:20.208 --> 16:22.125
Conor?

16:22.125 --> 16:24.583
[knocking]

16:24.583 --> 16:27.083
[knocking, woman moaning]

16:29.166 --> 16:31.083
What the fuck!

16:36.875 --> 16:38.458
(Conor)
I was making my bed!

16:39.750 --> 16:41.750
[exhales]

16:49.417 --> 16:51.250
- Ray Donovan?
- Yeah.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.333
(man)
Right over there.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.959
Just Mr. Donovan.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.750
This kid's
a fucking wreck.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.792
He's a rookie.

17:07.792 --> 17:11.125
"Casey Finney overpowers
his captors."

17:11.125 --> 17:12.959
That's not my brother's
usual headline.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.667
"Casey Finney drunk
at a funeral."

17:14.667 --> 17:16.000
"Casey Finney
arrested in panties."

17:16.000 --> 17:17.709
That's what we're used to.

17:17.709 --> 17:20.834
You're quite the miracle worker,
aren't you, Ray?

17:20.834 --> 17:22.667
What are we doing today?

17:22.667 --> 17:24.458
Zack...

17:24.458 --> 17:26.875
I wish I could tell you what Ray
recently did for my family.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.458
Ray, this is Zack Davis,
team owner.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.542
How are you?

17:29.542 --> 17:30.959
You like football?

17:30.959 --> 17:33.625
Sure.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.166
All right, you fix this,

17:35.166 --> 17:37.542
you got tickets
on the 50-yard line for life.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.500
Walk with me.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.458
This is Troy Landrieu,

17:47.458 --> 17:49.458
San Diego's starting quarterback
and my former client.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.500
Troy has a thing
for married women.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.750
Why you talking
about that?

17:52.750 --> 17:54.959
Why are you wearing
your sunglasses?

17:54.959 --> 17:56.458
Troy's most recent
distraction

17:56.458 --> 17:58.083
is the wife
of a Navy SEAL.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.917
The guy found out about
the affair two days ago,

17:59.917 --> 18:01.250
and he's threatened
to shoot Troy

18:01.250 --> 18:04.083
at tonight's game.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.291
I need you
to handle this quickly.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.166
I'll see you soon.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.417
If he's a former client,
why is he your problem?

18:11.417 --> 18:15.208
Because every former client
is a future client.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.792
We all set here?

18:18.375 --> 18:20.750
So I'm authorizing you
to go up to $500,000.

18:20.750 --> 18:21.709
Who's footing the bill?

18:21.709 --> 18:23.041
I am.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.458
Got an address?

18:28.458 --> 18:29.834
I'll text you.

18:29.834 --> 18:33.166
We sent emissaries;
he was not friendly.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.542
Good to know.

18:36.709 --> 18:39.208
What's the job?

18:39.208 --> 18:41.583
Keep an eye
on that quarterback.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.750
- Vartan, hey.
- Come in.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.750
(Mickey)
Stay in the car, Audrey.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.750
Back in ten minutes.

18:55.750 --> 18:56.917
(Audrey)
Fine.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.709
Pop, are you serious?

18:58.709 --> 19:00.083
The barbecue guy?

19:00.083 --> 19:01.750
Vartan is not
just Vartan.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.875
Vartan is connected.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.709
His sister's the bank.

19:04.709 --> 19:06.291
We're gonna need
starter cash.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.166
See, that's why I told you
to hold on to that money.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.709
It's all in the condo.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.917
I'm land-rich/cash-poor,

19:11.917 --> 19:13.333
like all the big guys.

19:20.291 --> 19:23.709
Hey, Pop, I don't like
the way she's looking at us.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.750
So she's a little weird.

19:32.542 --> 19:33.709
Here we go.

19:44.083 --> 19:47.125
You...

19:47.125 --> 19:50.542
be a good boy, hm?

19:50.542 --> 19:52.166
Sure.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.291
I take that to mean
we're in business?

20:04.291 --> 20:05.959
You understand
the terms, right?

20:05.959 --> 20:07.750
Sure, you give me 10 grand.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.083
I give you back 15 in a month.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.083
- No, not quite.
- Huh?

20:11.083 --> 20:13.333
Come on, let's walk
to your car.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.458
[phone ringing]

20:17.458 --> 20:19.291
(Mickey)
Hey, gorgeous.

20:19.291 --> 20:24.166
Oh, yeah, we're making
big progress, uh-huh.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.583
(man)
Give me the title.

20:25.583 --> 20:27.333
(Daryll)
Sorry, what?

20:27.333 --> 20:29.166
(man)
Give me the title
to your fucking car.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.166
Yeah.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.041
Hey, Pop, Pop.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.750
(Daryll)
Why does this guy want
the title to my car?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.792
You said ten minutes,
but it wasn't.

20:35.792 --> 20:37.625
It was 27.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.625
Yeah, yeah, Shirley Temple
is ready for her big entrance,

20:39.625 --> 20:40.709
and we're headed there now.

20:40.709 --> 20:42.250
Come on, come on.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.125
Pop, you're not using my car
for collateral.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.208
(Mickey)
Settle down.
It's a formality.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.000
Why you wearing a wig?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.375
You got cancer
or something?

20:48.375 --> 20:49.875
I'm in costume.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.792
I have an audition
at Walt Disney Studios.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.875
Oh, oh, yeah,
Make a Wish.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.667
They do good work.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.291
Here you go.

21:02.625 --> 21:04.458
Oh, and what's that?

21:04.458 --> 21:06.041
10K.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.250
Our shop is open.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.667
10K, Pop?

21:08.667 --> 21:11.458
This car cost me $70,000.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.709
You know what,
I'll take that.

21:13.709 --> 21:15.375
I'm your bank now.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.083
Hurry up, I don't want
to hit lunch traffic.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.917
Soon, sweetheart.

21:19.917 --> 21:24.291
Hey, who's in the mood
for a taco, huh?

21:26.083 --> 21:29.500
[phone ringing]

21:29.500 --> 21:31.000
What's up?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.792
I walked into your son's
bedroom this morning,

21:33.792 --> 21:36.875
and he was watching porn...

21:36.875 --> 21:38.792
and fucking his own bed.

21:38.792 --> 21:41.166
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.542
(Abby)
Your son Conor
stuck his teenage dick

21:43.542 --> 21:45.917
between his box spring
and his mattress

21:45.917 --> 21:47.291
and fucked his own bed.

21:47.291 --> 21:48.959
[laughs]

21:48.959 --> 21:52.333
[laughing]

21:52.333 --> 21:54.667
Did you ever do that?

21:54.667 --> 21:56.041
No, that's a new one.

21:56.041 --> 21:57.625
[Abby laughs]

22:00.625 --> 22:03.583
I'm sorry you got
dragged out here this morning.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.583
(Ray)
It's all right.

22:04.583 --> 22:06.166
I was glad to see them.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.375
Bridget really wants you
to come tonight.

22:11.375 --> 22:14.208
(Abby)
I got a rack of lamb,

22:14.208 --> 22:17.917
mushy peas, roasted potatoes.

22:17.917 --> 22:19.291
What do you say?

22:19.291 --> 22:22.709
I'll see what I can do.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.667
All right.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.625
Well, I hope we see you tonight.

22:44.583 --> 22:47.458
[men speaking Spanish]

22:56.834 --> 22:58.000
Excuse me.

22:59.417 --> 23:03.000
Ode, ode,  take five.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.792
I ran your credit card
three times.

23:08.792 --> 23:11.500
It's no good.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.458
Look, our last promoter
didn't pay us.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.750
We don't even have
a venue right now.

23:16.750 --> 23:17.709
Work with us.

23:17.709 --> 23:19.333
You got to pay to train.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.250
Come on, man.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.750
Sorry.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.375
All right.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.208
Then we'll clean out
the lockers.

23:29.792 --> 23:31.208
Vamonos.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.291
So you're a wrestler,
huh?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.125
Not "wrestler,"
"luchadora."

23:40.125 --> 23:42.041
There's a difference.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.834
What's the difference?

23:43.834 --> 23:46.041
One is an art form.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.125
Comes from myth
and history.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.583
One is SummerSlam
steroids bullshit.

23:52.208 --> 23:56.125
What's your
character's name?

23:56.125 --> 24:00.959
Her name's Mind Your
Business Maricon.

24:00.959 --> 24:04.333
So you really gonna
kick us out?

24:04.333 --> 24:05.625
Yeah.

24:05.625 --> 24:08.875
You know,
that's the rules.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.375
Yeah?

24:10.375 --> 24:11.875
You like rules?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.750
Hey, um...

24:21.750 --> 24:26.041
Look, you guys can finish
your workout today,

24:26.041 --> 24:29.500
and...

24:29.500 --> 24:32.166
we'll figure out
some kind of arrangement.

24:49.750 --> 24:53.208
I'm not taking
the money.

24:53.208 --> 24:54.792
You're the third guy
they sent.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.625
Mind if I sit for a minute?

25:04.625 --> 25:06.834
Doesn't look good
if I go back right away.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.041
Go ahead.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.959
You mind?

25:33.041 --> 25:34.458
Burning her stuff, huh?

25:34.458 --> 25:36.625
Shoes burn
like a motherfucker.

25:36.625 --> 25:39.875
(Carl)
They stink when they melt.

25:39.875 --> 25:41.625
Feel any better?

25:41.625 --> 25:47.500
Depends on when
you're talking to me.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.000
Changes, doesn't it?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
You hate her one minute,
miss her the next.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.792
(Ray)
She fucked around, but somehow
it still feels like your fault.

25:58.792 --> 26:02.458
You know, you could have been
a VA counselor.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.208
(Carl)
It's not a compliment.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.041
I'll ask you
to be on your way now.

26:12.417 --> 26:15.667
For what it's worth,
I've been where you are now.

26:15.667 --> 26:18.500
No one was offering me
half a million dollars.

26:21.291 --> 26:25.375
This book I read,

26:25.375 --> 26:29.000
The Privileged Few,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.709
it's about rich motherfuckers

26:30.709 --> 26:33.041
who believe they're
better than other people.

26:33.041 --> 26:37.834
Send me to Kandahar just to keep
their bond rates stable.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.458
You get me?

26:39.458 --> 26:41.125
(Carl)
By the same logic,

26:41.125 --> 26:44.417
a wealthy white man,
he sees my wife,

26:44.417 --> 26:46.792
he says, "I like her look.

26:46.792 --> 26:49.333
"She got a wedding band on,
but who gives a fuck?

26:49.333 --> 26:51.959
"I'm gonna use my money

26:51.959 --> 26:54.083
"to seduce
this low-income female.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.250
"Now you know
what I'm gonna do?

26:56.250 --> 26:59.333
"I'm gonna offer her husband
a six-figure sum

26:59.333 --> 27:02.041
"to say, 'Yeah, boss,
go right ahead.

27:02.041 --> 27:05.375
"'You want to put it
in her asshole, just...

27:05.375 --> 27:09.250
fuck away.'"

27:09.250 --> 27:10.417
Take the money.

27:10.417 --> 27:12.250
(Carl)
I don't want the money.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.500
I want my wife.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.417
(Ray)
I can't help you with that.

27:17.417 --> 27:21.625
But I can help you
make a new start.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.417
That's something.

27:26.750 --> 27:30.417
Hey, mister, you got mold
in that locker room.

27:30.417 --> 27:31.834
That shit
is a health hazard.

27:31.834 --> 27:34.417
What are you gonna
do about it?

27:34.417 --> 27:36.583
You're not even
a member here.

27:36.583 --> 27:39.834
You said we was gonna
work something out, right?

27:39.834 --> 27:41.250
Yeah, but...

27:41.250 --> 27:43.917
So today
I'm a member.

27:43.917 --> 27:45.500
And you better clean
that locker room,

27:45.500 --> 27:48.250
because if it remains
filthy in here,

27:48.250 --> 27:50.166
I will fuck with you.

27:51.417 --> 27:56.041
Okay, I'll--
I'll take a look.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.834
Damn right, you will.

28:03.417 --> 28:04.667
Shirley's the main part.

28:04.667 --> 28:07.250
They'll give me a trailer
and a big hotel room.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.333
And a big car,

28:08.333 --> 28:10.166
bigger than yours.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.542
Cool.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.333
My mom and I will get
a bunch of money,

28:14.333 --> 28:16.125
like millions.

28:16.125 --> 28:17.625
Yeah, I really don't think
anyone's giving you

28:17.625 --> 28:18.625
millions of dollars.

28:18.625 --> 28:19.917
(Audrey)
Of course they will.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.291
They gave Scarlett Johansson
$10 million.

28:22.291 --> 28:23.458
You ain't no
Scarlett Johansson.

28:23.458 --> 28:24.625
(Audrey)
Neither are you.

28:24.625 --> 28:28.333
You're just
some car person.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.291
Okay, look here...Shirley.

28:31.291 --> 28:34.500
There's probably, like,
2,000 little girls

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
just like you
going to those auditions,

28:36.500 --> 28:39.875
thinking, "I'm Shirley,
and I'm gonna be famous."

28:39.875 --> 28:41.750
And you want to know
what you all got in common?

28:41.750 --> 28:44.667
Ain't none of y'all
gonna play Shirley Temple.

28:44.667 --> 28:46.041
[crying]

28:46.041 --> 28:50.166
Except maybe...
the really talented ones.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.792
Like you maybe.

28:51.792 --> 28:53.333
Shirley, honey.

28:53.333 --> 28:55.959
(Mickey)
Hey.

28:55.959 --> 28:57.208
Oh, baby, don't cry.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.834
Here, play with my phone, okay?

28:58.834 --> 29:00.750
Stop drinking all that soda.

29:00.750 --> 29:02.834
Hey, we're really late!

29:08.333 --> 29:11.625
Give me $5,000.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.208
Pop, are you out
of your fucking mind?

29:14.208 --> 29:15.166
No.

29:15.166 --> 29:16.417
Hey, fellas.

29:16.417 --> 29:17.834
I'm really sorry
for any confusion,

29:17.834 --> 29:20.750
but I have no interest
in buying cocaine.

29:20.750 --> 29:23.291
We took the Big Blue Bus
out here, homes.

29:23.291 --> 29:25.959
I hate that fucking bus.

29:25.959 --> 29:27.583
Look, look.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.458
We buy this stuff for 5,

29:29.458 --> 29:31.417
we cut it,
we sell it for 15.

29:31.417 --> 29:33.458
Pay up, otherwise we won't
be able to do business

29:33.458 --> 29:35.333
anywhere east of the 110.

29:35.333 --> 29:36.500
Come on, where is it?

29:36.500 --> 29:37.875
I got it.

29:40.792 --> 29:43.792
All right, there, good.

29:48.709 --> 29:50.917
It's all there.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.500
Who slept with your wife?

29:59.458 --> 30:02.583
Bet he wasn't part
of your fantasy football team.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.875
[chuckles]

30:04.875 --> 30:07.166
No, he wasn't.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.166
What'd you do about him?

30:09.166 --> 30:12.083
I let it go.

30:12.083 --> 30:15.583
You forgave.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.333
That's bullshit, man.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.750
(Carl)
That forgiveness shit
ain't so easy.

30:24.625 --> 30:27.750
[phone ringing]

30:29.792 --> 30:30.750
Yeah.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.000
(Paige)
You have him?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.458
We're heading there now.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.417
(Paige)
Re-route to the Saxton Hotel.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.125
(Ray)
Why?

30:37.125 --> 30:39.041
(Paige)
We have some lawyers
waiting here in a suite.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.333
I'll meet you outside.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.959
What's this meeting
gonna look like?

30:46.959 --> 30:48.959
(Ray)
Probably make you sign
a nondisclosure

30:48.959 --> 30:53.291
and then give you
a certified check.

30:53.291 --> 30:55.458
Just like that, huh?

30:55.458 --> 30:56.834
Just like that.

31:03.083 --> 31:06.750
I want to make money
just like the next man, okay?

31:06.750 --> 31:08.667
I mean, I'm open-minded,

31:08.667 --> 31:11.792
but you can't keep giving me
this stuff in bits and pieces.

31:11.792 --> 31:13.291
I need to see
the bigger picture,

31:13.291 --> 31:14.709
what you're trying to do,
you understand?

31:14.709 --> 31:19.417
I do, and that was
very well said.

31:19.417 --> 31:21.250
This is so I'm clear.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.792
We're selling coke now?

31:22.792 --> 31:24.583
We're not selling coke.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.583
The whores are selling the coke.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.834
Did you kill that pimp?

31:36.834 --> 31:39.625
Technically,
the water killed the pimp.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.625
(Audrey)
I got to do it again!

31:41.625 --> 31:43.875
What's going on?
What's going on?

31:43.875 --> 31:46.125
They won't give me
a second chance.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.041
Oh, the hell they won't.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.792
Nicole Adamson.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.917
Hold on, you're not finished
with Audrey Andrews yet.

31:51.917 --> 31:53.709
We've seen enough.

31:53.709 --> 31:56.166
This is a little girl's
future you're talking about.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.667
Now bring her
back in there.

31:57.667 --> 31:58.625
I'm sorry, sir.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.875
She's not our Shirley.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.959
- It's not fair.
- Nicole.

32:03.709 --> 32:05.041
Right this way.

32:05.041 --> 32:06.834
Failure is
a part of life.

32:06.834 --> 32:09.709
But when God closes a door,
He opens a window.

32:09.709 --> 32:11.375
Fuck you, Mickey.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.709
Thank you so much
for coming, Mr. Lafell.

32:30.709 --> 32:32.709
I'm sorry
about the circumstances.

32:32.709 --> 32:33.959
It's Suite 42A.

32:33.959 --> 32:35.709
Team representatives
are up there now.

32:35.709 --> 32:37.208
I'll be up in a moment.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.750
Yeoman work, you're on
my Christmas card list.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.000
I should probably
go up with him.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.166
He'll find his way.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.917
Keep me company
for a minute.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.166
You ever drive
an Aston Martin?

32:52.166 --> 32:54.333
- No.
- I love that car.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.542
It wasn't a gift
from Daddy,

32:55.542 --> 32:56.792
if that's what
you were thinking.

32:56.792 --> 32:58.917
- It wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

32:58.917 --> 33:01.083
I started my business
with my own money.

33:01.083 --> 33:03.333
My first signing
was a seventh-round draft pick.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.375
He was a gangly kid
from Arizona State.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.041
- Troy Landrieu.
- Mm-hmm.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.750
He couldn't run, but he had
a cannon for an arm.

33:08.750 --> 33:09.917
I believed in him.

33:09.917 --> 33:11.667
He wound up starting
for San Diego.

33:11.667 --> 33:14.000
I made good decisions
for that prospect,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.959
and I bought this car
with the money I earned.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.291
We should leave now.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.000
Why?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.959
Just remember,
I didn't break the law,

33:27.959 --> 33:28.959
and neither did you.

Do the other side now.

35:15.291 --> 35:16.875
Clean the metal.

35:21.542 --> 35:23.709
Put muscle into it.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.750
- I am.
- You're not.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.208
You're lazy.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.542
How do you know?

35:29.542 --> 35:32.250
I can tell.

35:32.250 --> 35:35.083
Add more soap.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.959
How much more?

35:36.959 --> 35:38.583
A thimble-full.

you're looking at?

Pervert too.

35:53.709 --> 35:57.250
Man, this is
one shitty gym.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.166
I'll just finish
that later.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.625
(Pablo)
Hey, chief, I had an idea.

36:20.792 --> 36:23.834
You okay?

36:23.834 --> 36:26.959
Yeah, what?

36:26.959 --> 36:28.333
Your place is a good size.

36:28.333 --> 36:31.291
We don't have a venue.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.709
What if you host our events
and we split the door?

36:37.500 --> 36:39.041
Have your shows here,
you mean?

36:39.041 --> 36:40.291
Yeah, why not?

36:40.291 --> 36:41.875
Do, like,
a five show run.

36:41.875 --> 36:44.041
Maybe we'd all
make some money.

36:44.041 --> 36:46.625
What does something
like that cost?

36:46.625 --> 36:48.709
$20,000.

36:48.709 --> 36:50.542
But it's profitable.

36:50.542 --> 36:54.166
In Houston we turned
20 into, like, 60.

36:56.667 --> 36:58.667
Let me think about it.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.375
Mm-hmm.

37:13.792 --> 37:16.709
You looking for
a strong arm, Paige?

37:16.709 --> 37:19.792
Someone to break
bones for you?

37:19.792 --> 37:21.041
Carl Lafell is--

37:21.041 --> 37:23.000
All you had to do was ask.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.834
I'll remember that.

37:29.125 --> 37:32.625
You like a little blood,
don't you, Paige.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.417
Excuse me?

37:35.417 --> 37:40.959
Does it turn you on,
hurting people?

37:40.959 --> 37:42.792
You better watch
what you say to me, Ray.

37:42.792 --> 37:44.709
What are you gonna do?

37:44.709 --> 37:45.667
Call your daddy,

37:45.667 --> 37:48.000

out for you?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.542
Is that the best
you can do?

37:52.709 --> 37:54.208
You tell him

37:54.208 --> 37:56.208
I want a check
for $500,000

37:56.208 --> 37:59.834

to Carl Lafell today.

37:59.834 --> 38:02.875
Or what?

38:02.875 --> 38:05.208
Or I'm gonna put you in
the trunk of that Aston Martin

38:05.208 --> 38:06.917
and drive it
off a fucking cliff.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.000
You ready, ding?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.750
I'm here, ain't I?

38:35.750 --> 38:37.417

as always.

39:58.875 --> 40:02.792

40:02.792 --> 40:04.125
Evening.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.000
(Finney)
Come on in, Ray.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.166
How was the drive
from San Diego?

40:08.166 --> 40:09.417
You got
what I came for?

40:09.417 --> 40:14.083
Oh, straight to the point,
I like that.

40:14.083 --> 40:16.834
She doesn't often
ask for my help,

40:16.834 --> 40:18.500
so you must have
scared her half to death.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.208
Trust me, she deserved it.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.542
(Finney)
Maybe she did.

40:23.834 --> 40:27.208
She's been that way
since she was a little girl.

40:27.208 --> 40:30.542
Thinks the world
is a cruel place.

40:30.542 --> 40:32.667
(Finney)
Got to give her credit, though,
for hedging her bets.

40:32.667 --> 40:35.250
You know she represents
the backup quarterback.

40:38.834 --> 40:40.917
(Finney)
Your check, Mr. Donovan.

40:40.917 --> 40:43.083
Children of the wealthy
don't always have it

40:43.083 --> 40:44.875
as easy as you think.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.458
You making excuses for them?

40:46.458 --> 40:47.750
(Finney)
Oh, yes, I am,

40:47.750 --> 40:49.458
because I'm retiring soon.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.583
I need someone to keep
an eye on my kids

40:51.583 --> 40:54.208
while I settle my affairs.

40:54.208 --> 40:57.500
So I had a contract drawn up
to buy you and your services

40:57.500 --> 40:59.875
and your company
lock, stock, and barrel.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.333
Take a look.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.917
An executive, I can buy
at any corner market.

41:03.917 --> 41:08.000
But you, Mr. Donovan,
not quite so easy.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.583
What do you think?

41:14.834 --> 41:17.041
The numbers don't suit?

41:17.041 --> 41:19.667
I'm not for sale.

41:19.667 --> 41:22.250
So we're still
negotiating.

41:29.041 --> 41:30.917
Take the job with Avi.

41:30.917 --> 41:33.333
Why?

41:33.333 --> 41:36.750
Because you don't want
to be my partner right now.

41:36.750 --> 41:39.041
What the fuck?

41:39.041 --> 41:40.583
What is it with you?

41:40.583 --> 41:42.458
Why can't you ever
just ask for my help?

41:49.667 --> 41:52.458
Fuck it.

41:52.458 --> 41:54.625
You're right.

41:54.625 --> 41:58.000
I don't want
to be your partner.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.542
Fair enough.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.709
Big picture
you wanted, right?

42:42.166 --> 42:45.250
We supply the girls cocaine

42:45.250 --> 42:47.959
and the ability
to front cash.

42:47.959 --> 42:49.500
They sell the Johns coke.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.166
And when Johnny wants to do 'em
a second time

42:51.166 --> 42:53.667
and can't pay for it,
we loan him the money.

42:53.667 --> 42:55.041
We split the proceeds
with the girls,

42:55.041 --> 42:57.333

these fuckers.

I'm gonna say this,

43:03.500 --> 43:04.583
but that actually
makes sense.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.375
I see it as a franchise.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.750
Cash will be
flying in, son.

43:07.750 --> 43:11.583
And you're gonna be

I got to do?

43:15.333 --> 43:17.291
Keep track
of the ladies.

43:17.291 --> 43:19.959
