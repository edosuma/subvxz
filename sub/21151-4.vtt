GENERALS.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.618
>> I'M EXCITED, BRO.

00:17.651 --> 00:22.356
>> MYSELF, MARK AND MATT, I FELT
LIKE WE'VE BEEN ON THE SAME PAGE

00:22.390 --> 00:23.357
SINCE DAY ONE.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.861
>> Announcer: BUT CODY TEASED
OF A POSSIBLE BACK-UP PLAN.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.664
>> PAUL, DUDE, YOU'RE STILL ON
MY RADAR.

01:03.697 --> 01:08.269
IF ONE OF THOSE GIRLS COMES OFF
THE BLOCK, YOU'RE STILL A

01:08.302 --> 01:09.370
POSSIBILITY.

THE DEN.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.614
IF THE TEMPTATION IS ACCEPTED,
IT WILL UNLEASH A CONSEQUENCE ON

01:20.648 --> 01:23.451
THE HOUSE.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.919
>> Announcer: AND AMERICA

ACCEPT THIS AND THE PENDENT WILL
PROTECT YOU AT THE NEXT THREE

01:33.561 --> 01:34.628
EVICTIONS.

01:34.662 --> 01:39.800

HE'S OVER.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.243
THERE I'D RATHER NOT DEAL WITH
THAT.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.679
>> APPARENTLY YOU'RE RACIST.

01:51.712 --> 01:56.350
>> Announcer: JESSICA WENT THE
CLEAR THE AIR WITH ALICE.

01:56.384 --> 01:59.687

>> Announcer: PUTTING MEGAN IN
THE LINE OF FIRE.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.791
>> YOU LIED AND MADE UP A RACIST
COMMENT.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.427
>> I DID NOT MAKE UP A RACIST
COMMENT.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.995
>> THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

02:08.028 --> 02:09.397
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:09.430 --> 02:12.433
>> Announcer: WITH EMOTIONS
HIGH...

02:12.466 --> 02:14.335
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
THIS.

THIS SUMMER.

02:23.143 --> 02:23.644

>> WOW.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.981

TO EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH TO

02:40.428 --> 02:41.262
ALEX.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.496
>> YOU WOULD NEVER CONSIDER
COMING OVER?

02:42.530 --> 02:46.133
>> I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR HER,
AND I'M TRYING EXTEND WHATEVER

02:46.166 --> 02:50.804
KIND OF BRIDGE I CAN FOR HER TO
COME OVER TO MY SIDE OF THE

02:50.838 --> 02:51.805
HOUSE.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.940
>> Announcer: BUT THE GAMER
DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY.

02:52.973 --> 02:57.345
>> THE BEST THING WOULD BE
BREAKING UP YOU GUYS.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.112
>> YOU'RE KILLING ME.

02:59.146 --> 03:02.149
>> Announcer: SO SHE FOUND
HERSELF ON ON THE BLOCK.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.886
>> Announcer: I'VE NOMINATED
YOU, ALEX.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.323
>> Announcer: TONIGHT WILL THE
POWER OF VETO SAVE ALEX OR

03:09.357 --> 03:13.126
JILLIAN, OR WILL CODY SET HIS
SIGHTS ON A NEW TARGET?

03:13.160 --> 03:17.998
PLUS WHICH HOUSEGUEST WILL
SUFFER A CURSE INSIDE THE DEN OF

03:18.031 --> 03:18.799
TEMPTATION?

03:18.832 --> 03:23.103
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER."

03:23.136 --> 03:33.180
>> THIS CHICK IS WRAPPING
HERSELF IN FREEDOM.

03:33.180 --> 03:43.190
>> THIS CHICK IS WRAPPING
HERSELF IN FREEDOM.

04:09.817 --> 04:23.897
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.800
BECAUSE MEGAN IS NO LONGER IN
THIS GAME, I HAD TO NOMINATE

04:26.834 --> 04:27.468
SOMEONE.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.069
IT WAS ALEX.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.272
EVEN THOUGH ALEX IS GUNNING FOR
PEOPLE ON MY SIDE OF THE HOUSE,

04:32.306 --> 04:33.541
I RESPECT ALEX.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.344
I THINK SHE DESERVES TO BE HERE,
BUT I HAD THE MAKE THIS MOVE TO

04:36.377 --> 04:37.878
KEEP MY SIDE OF THE HOUSE HAPPY.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.148
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST DOING WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE TEAM.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.883
>> WE'RE IN A GREAT POSITION.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.718
WE SEEM TO BE UNUP TOABLE.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.953
WE HAVE ALL THE COUPLES.

04:45.986 --> 04:50.290
WE HAVE DOMINIQUE, WE HAVE PAUL
AND CHRISTMAS.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.992
IT SHOULD BE SMOOTH SAILING THE
NEXT FEW WEEKS.

04:52.025 --> 04:56.430
>> EVEN THOUGH I LIKE ALEX, HER
BEING UP ON THE BLOCK IS A GOOD

04:56.464 --> 04:58.799
GAME MOVE FOR ME, AND THE PEOPLE
I'M WORKING WITH.

04:58.832 --> 05:08.942
SHE'S A FIERCE COMPETITOR, SO
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

05:08.942 --> 05:15.349
SHE'S A FIERCE COMPETITOR, SO
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

05:15.383 --> 05:19.186
>> FIRST CODY PUT ME ON THE
BLOCK AGAINST MEGAN, WHO WAS MY

05:19.219 --> 05:20.320
FRIEND.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.222
NOW HE PUTS ME ON THE BLOCK
AGAINST ALEX, WHO IS ALSO MY

05:22.255 --> 05:23.424
FRIEND.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.059
SO AT THIS POINT ANYONE I'M
ASSOCIATED WITH US, HE'S PUTTING

05:26.093 --> 05:27.127
US UP ON THE BLOCK.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.132
IT REALLY SUCKS.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.068
I'M SITTING HERE LOOKING MYSELF
ON THE BLOCK.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.506
CODY, IF I WIN THAT POWER OF
VETO, I'M COMING FOR YOU.

05:38.539 --> 05:49.082
>> GET THE SHOWMANCE OUT OF THE
WAY.

05:49.116 --> 05:53.020
>>>> YOU WERE EMOTIONAL.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.755
>> I WAS NOT EMOTIONAL.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.023
>> YES, YOU WERE.

05:56.056 --> 05:56.657
>> NO, I WASN'T.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.025
>> YOU GOT CHOKED UP.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.126
>> I DID NOT.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.828
>> YOU 100% DID.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.895
>> NO, I DID NOT.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.096
>> WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT?

06:03.130 --> 06:08.101
>> A BRIEF CLEARING OF THE
THROAT SO I COULD EXPRESS MY

06:08.135 --> 06:10.771
THOUGHTS APPROPRIATELY.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.473
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ALEX.

06:12.506 --> 06:17.177
I WAS TRYING THE FIND LIKE ANY
WAY OUR INTEREST WOULD ALIGN AT

06:17.210 --> 06:21.014
ALL, AND I COULDN'T FIND ANY
COMMON GROUND THERE.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.652
>> I LOVE SEEING CODY GET
EMOTIONAL, AND IT'S A REALLY

06:24.685 --> 06:29.122
CUTE SIDE OF HIM, HOWEVER, I
DON'T WANT TO SEE IT ABOUT ALEX.

06:29.156 --> 06:35.563
>> OKAY.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.198
I NEED TO BREAK THAT CONNECTION
OFF AND GET HER OUT OF THIS

06:38.231 --> 06:40.901
HOUSE, BECAUSE IT'S NAUSEATING.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.037
MAYBE YOU'RE OF A MARSHALL THAN
I THOUGHT.

06:44.071 --> 06:54.915
>> PLEASE.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
>> GOOD WORK, DUDE.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.654
A LITTLE TOUGH, AND IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHOSE FEELINGS YOU HURT

07:00.688 --> 07:01.388
RIGHT NOW.

07:01.421 --> 07:09.497
THAT'S JUST MY PERSONNEL
OPINION.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.798
I RESPECT THE WAY YOU DID IT.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.602
I HAVE THE PENDENT OF PROTECTION
GUARANTEEING ME SAFETY FOR THREE

07:14.635 --> 07:16.269
WEEKS, AND NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT
IT.

07:16.303 --> 07:20.608
EVEN THOUGH I'M GOOD WITH ALL
ENDS OF THE HOUSE, I'M GOING TO

07:20.641 --> 07:24.111
LEAN WHERE THE POWER IS AND
WHERE I SEE THE NUMBERS ARE THIS

07:24.144 --> 07:25.378
WEEK.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.215
I KNOW THAT'S NOT EASY, MAN, YOU
MADE TWO STRONG MOVES THE FIRST

07:28.248 --> 07:29.382
WEEK OF THE GAME.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.985
>> EVERYTHING PAUL EVER THROWS
AT ME IS JUST STUFF THAT HE

07:32.019 --> 07:33.554
THINKS THAT I WANT TO HEAR.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.755
I'M JUST NOT BUYING IT.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.991
THIS IS HOW HE GOT THROUGH HIS
SEASON, AND I JUST DON'T LIKE

07:38.025 --> 07:39.192
HIM.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.696
>> I JUST WANTED TO COME HERE
AND TELL YOU, PUT THAT IN YOUR

07:42.730 --> 07:43.430
HEAD IN THE FUTURE.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.966
>> YOU HAVE BANANA IN YOUR
BEARD.

07:45.999 --> 07:59.046
SERIOUSLY.

07:59.079 --> 08:05.118
>> I DID NOT COME HERE TO FIND A
BOYFRIEND.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.055
THE REASON THESE GIRLS ARE GOING
TO GET TO THE END IS BECAUSE

08:08.088 --> 08:10.991
THEY TEAMED UP WITH GUYS WHO ARE
STRONGER THAN THEY ARE.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.325
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING, DUDE.

08:12.359 --> 08:17.130
>> ALEX IS MAKING A GOOD POINT
ABOUT THESE SHOWMANCES.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.133
I MIGHT BE RODEO CLOWN, AND I'M
NOT FOOL.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.503
BECAUSE ALEX HAS THE SAME
FEELINGS I DO, KEEPING HER IS

08:23.537 --> 08:27.440
GOOD FOR MY GAME.

08:27.474 --> 08:30.911
>> THE SMART THING TO DO WOULD
BE TO GET RID OF CODY.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.779
HE'S A BEAST.

08:31.812 --> 08:36.750
>> THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO IS YOU
WIN POV.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.252
JASON IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE I
TRUST MOST IN THE HOUSE.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.089
I HOPE JASON GETS PICKED FOR THE
VETO COMPETITION.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.825
IF HE WIN, HE CAN STAY AND TAKE
ME OFF THE BLOCK.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.694
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

08:46.727 --> 08:55.736
I'M GOING TO FREAKIN' TAKE THEM
ALL OUT.

08:55.769 --> 09:00.407
>> THIS IS DEFINITELY COOL.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.942
I'M JUST POINTING IT OUT.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.345
>> PERSONALLY I HAVE TO.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.348
NO, NO, NO.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.919
>> I JUST HAVE THE FIRST POV
TOMORROW.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.622
IF I HAVE TO PICK, I'M GOING TO
OF COURSE JASON.

09:14.655 --> 09:18.659
AND I KNOW REGARDLESS, IT SUCKS
FOR ME BECAUSE I KNOW IF I COME

09:18.692 --> 09:20.928
OFF, SHE'S GOING HOME.

09:20.961 --> 09:26.266
>> SO HOW COME YOU NEVER WANTED
TO ROLL OVER?

09:26.299 --> 09:29.536
>> THE GIRLS DON'T LIKE ME.

09:29.569 --> 09:35.508
YOU WANT A SHOWMANCE, GO ON "THE
BACHELOR."

09:35.542 --> 09:37.510
>> I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT MY GAME.

09:37.544 --> 09:44.184
BUT EMOTIONALLY, I'M NOT INTO A
SHOWMANCE.

09:44.217 --> 09:44.918
>> I DON'T WANT THE COMPETE
AGAINST YOU.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.920
>> DO YOU WANT THE FIGURE IT
OUT.

09:46.954 --> 09:52.626
>> I DEFINITELY DO.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.228
>> I REGRET PUTTING UP ALEX.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.496
SHE DESERVES TO BE HERE.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.465
I'VE HAD RESPECT FOR ALEX SINCE
DAY ONE.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.066
SHE'S STRONG.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.033
SHE'S A GREAT COMPETITOR.

10:00.067 --> 10:10.110
SO I REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT
RIGHT.

10:10.110 --> 10:17.885
SO I REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT
RIGHT.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.086
>> MY FAMILY TONIGHT HAVE TV.

10:19.119 --> 10:24.257
THEY LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY
DON'T HAVE GREAT RECEPTION.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.458
>> HERE WE GO.

10:25.492 --> 10:28.962
>> AS YOU KNOW, ONE OF YOUR
HOUSEMATES GAVE INTO TEMPTATION,

10:28.996 --> 10:31.131
SO NOW IT'S TIME TO SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCE.

10:31.164 --> 10:35.836
>> HOUSEGUESTS, ONE BY ONE WE
WILL ALL REENTER THE DEN AND

10:35.869 --> 10:38.238
PLACE HAND IN THE SERPENT'S
MOUTH.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.807
>> NO, NO, NO.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.175
>> ONE OF US WILL BE BITTEN AND
CURSED.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.312
IF THE SNAKE'S EYES TURN GREEN,
YOU ARE SAFE.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.749
IF THEY TURN POISON BLUE, YOU
HAVE BEEN CURSED.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.951
>> I'M A GOD-FEARING WOMAN.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.387
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WOULD BE
CURSES IN THE "BIG BROTHER"

10:54.421 --> 10:54.955
HOUSE.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.823
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.324
I'M FREAKING OUT.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.293
>> ONLY THE BITTEN HOUSEGUEST
WILL LEARN THE DETAILS OF THIS

11:00.327 --> 11:01.494
CURSE.

11:01.528 --> 11:04.331
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: THE PERSON
WHO ACCEPTED THE TEMPTATION

11:04.364 --> 11:05.465
RANDOMLY SELECTED A NUMBER.

11:05.498 --> 11:11.438
THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW WHICH
NUMBER HE OR SHE PICKED.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.474
IF YOU ENTER THE DEN FIRST, YOUR
NUMBER IS ONE.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.478
IF YOU ENTER THE DEN SECOND,
YOUR NUMBER IS TWO, AND SO ON.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.549
IF THE NUMBER THAT YOU ENTER THE
DEN MATCHES THE RANDOMLY

11:22.582 --> 11:24.151
SELECTED NUMBER, YOU WILL BE
BITTEN.

11:24.184 --> 11:24.985
GOOD LUCK.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.419
>> I HATE SNAKES.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.520
>> CAN I GO FIRST?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.522
>> WHY DON'T WE MAKE A LINE SO
WE KNOW.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.224
>> LET'S MAKE A LINE.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.492
LET'S MAKE A LINE.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.163
>> I'M LIKE BRING IT ON, BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN ON THE BLOCK SINCE DAY

11:36.196 --> 11:36.997
ONE.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.332
MY GOOD FRIEND IS ON THE BLOCK
WITH ME.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.769
I'M SLEEPING ON A BED OF SPIKES.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.702
I'MDING SLOP EVERY DAY.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.106
LET'S ADD ANOTHER ONE TO THE
LIST.

11:46.139 --> 11:51.745
LET'S JUST CHECK IT OFF.

11:51.779 --> 11:56.416
>> OH, MY GOD.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.987
>> I HATE SNAKES.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.554
OH, GOD, I HATE SNAKES.

12:01.588 --> 12:09.062
I'M NOT A FAN.

12:09.096 --> 12:13.834
>> OH, GOD, THANK YOU.

12:13.867 --> 12:14.367
I'M GOOD.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.069
I GOT THE GREEN EYES.

12:16.103 --> 12:16.636
GOOD JOB.

12:16.669 --> 12:27.881
NOT ME.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.182
>> OH, GOOD.

12:29.216 --> 12:34.021
OH, GOOD.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.823
WAIT, STOP.

12:35.856 --> 12:36.990
YOU'RE LYING.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.292
>> Announcer: YOU HAVE BEEN
BITTEN AND A NOMINATION CURSE

12:39.326 --> 12:41.962
NOW RUNS THROUGH YOUR VEINS.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.898
UNFORTUNATELY THIS CURSE WILL
FORCE YOU TO PLACE YOURSELF ON

12:44.932 --> 12:48.035
THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

12:48.068 --> 12:52.172

SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE, THUS
REVEALING YOUR CURSE TO THE

HOUSE.

13:03.650 --> 13:08.155
IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU
CHOOSE TO REVEAL THE CURSE

13:08.188 --> 13:08.822
BEFORE THEN.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.090
>> OH, MY GOSH.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.726
NOT ONLY ARE PEOPLE THAT I'M
CLOSE WITH ON THE BLOCK THIS

13:13.760 --> 13:16.263
WEEK, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT
MYSELF ON THE BLOCK WITHIN THE

13:16.296 --> 13:17.530
NEXT THREE WEEKS.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.734
I NEED A PLAN VERY STRATEGICALLY
WHEN I WANT TO DO THIS SO THAT I

13:21.768 --> 13:33.246
KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE THE
VOTES TO STAY IN THE HOUSE.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.547
>> THIS IS SO COOL.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.550
>> AFTER ACCEPTING THAT
BEAUTIFUL TEMPTATION FROM

13:37.584 --> 13:41.454
AMERICA, YOUR BOY DOESN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ANY CURSES, SO

13:41.488 --> 13:43.823
SNAKE DEN AND CHILL.

13:43.857 --> 13:48.528
OH, GOD, NO.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.163
>> THAT IS A HUGE SNAKE.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.099
>> I CAN'T LOOK AT THIS THING.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.600
I'M TERRIFIED OF SNAKES.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.370
>> I HATE SNAKES.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.271
>> OH, MAN.

13:58.305 --> 14:06.179
>> IF IT BITES ME I'M GOING TO
BE PISSED.

14:06.213 --> 14:12.152
>> OH, MY GOD.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.954
>> THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING SNAKE.

14:13.987 --> 14:18.291
AS FAR AS NASTY-ASS SNAKES GO.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.227
>> I SEE THE SNAKE.

14:20.260 --> 14:24.231
I DON'T CARE.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.632
>> I'M GOOD.

14:25.665 --> 14:31.538
I'M GOOD.

14:31.571 --> 14:39.913
>> THAT SNAKE WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL
IN MY HOUSE.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.550
>> HEY, Y'ALL, TIME TO PICK

SHE'S A TARGET ON MY SIDE OF THE
HOUSE, BUT SHE'S NOT THE ONE I

15:05.205 --> 15:06.606
WANT THE GO HOME THIS WEEK.

15:06.639 --> 15:15.148
AS H.O.H., I WILL PICK FIRST.

MATT.

15:41.941 --> 15:42.509
[APPLAUSE]
>> BOOM.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.743
INSTANT SMILES ALL AROUND.

15:43.776 --> 15:48.548
IF I WIN IT, I KNOW I'M SAFE AND
I CAN GET ALEX OFF THE BLOCK.

15:48.581 --> 15:52.885
>> I ALSO HAVE TO CHOOSE A HOST
FOR THE VETO COMPETITION, AND I

GOOD LUCK.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.835
>> DUDE, THAT WAS PERFECT.

16:08.868 --> 16:09.836
>> I KNOW, RIGHT.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.105
>> YOU PICKING THAT WAS PERFECT.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.440
RAVEN BEING UP THERE IS PERFECT.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.774
>> I AM PUMPED.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.009
I LIKE IT.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.711
>> EVERYONE AROUND ME WANTS THE
GET ALEX OUT THIS WEEK, BUT IF

16:18.745 --> 16:21.514
SHE WINS THIS VETO COMPETITION,
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING

16:21.548 --> 16:22.715
FOR ME.

16:22.749 --> 16:27.087
>> I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING
CODY PUT ANOTHER PERSON UP FOR

16:27.120 --> 16:27.554
NOMINATION THIS WEEK.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.755
>> IT CAN HAPPEN.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.956
>> IT'S CRAZY.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.523
>> YEAH.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.524
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.560
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO.

16:51.978 --> 16:55.482
>> I WALK OUT INTO THE YARD, AND
I SEE BEAUTIFUL SAND, SOME PALM

16:55.515 --> 17:01.354
TREES, AND WHAT IS THAT, IS THAT
NEPTUNE HIMSELF, A BEAUTIFUL

17:01.388 --> 17:02.589
MER-MAN?

17:02.622 --> 17:07.660
OH, WAIT, THAT'S JUST KEVIN IN
MY CYST EARS HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.663
>> KEV, I LOVE IT, BUDDY.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.331
YOU LOOK GREAT.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.766
>> THIS GIRDLE IS KILLING ME.

17:13.800 --> 17:20.140
NO WAY I WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT
I'D HAVE A MERMAID OUTFIT ON ON

17:20.173 --> 17:20.507
TV.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.308
>> SIT DOWN.

17:21.341 --> 17:25.078
>> I'M BECOMING A DIFFERENT
PERSON.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.045
I'M EMBRACING THE L.A.

17:26.079 --> 17:26.679
LIFESTYLE.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.282
I'M EATING YOGA AND GRANOLA.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.750
WELCOME TO THE "BIG BROTHER"
RESORT.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.087
PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AND WIDE TO
RELAX AND SEE THE STARS,

17:34.121 --> 17:35.288
STARFISH THAT IS.

17:35.322 --> 17:40.460
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: ON GO, PULL
THE PLUG AND START THE WATER

17:40.493 --> 17:41.694
FLOWING.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.265
THEN FIND A STARFISH AND TAKE IT
UP THE BEACH TO YOUR STACKING

17:45.298 --> 17:46.266
SHELVES.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.668
YOU MAY ONLY BRING BACK ONE
STARFISH AT A TIME.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.571
YOUR GOAL IS TO STACK AS MANY
STARFISH ON YOUR SHELF AS

17:51.604 --> 17:52.772
POSSIBLE.

17:52.805 --> 17:58.111
BUT BEWARE, YOU MAY ONLY STACK
STARFISH IF THERE IS WATER IN

17:58.145 --> 18:00.046
YOUR AQUAPOD.

18:00.079 --> 18:06.018
YOU NEED TO KEEP ADDING WATER IF
YOU NEED MORE STACKING TIME.

18:06.052 --> 18:12.625
WHEN YOUR AQUAPOD RUNS OUT, YOUR
STACK IS YOUR SCORE.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.796
THIS SUMMER, WHAT WOULD THE VETO
COMPETITION BE WITHOUT A LITTLE

18:16.829 --> 18:18.064
TEMPTATION?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.967
IF YOU'RE FIRST TO FIND A LARGE
GOLDEN STARFISH AND STACK IT ON

18:21.000 --> 18:25.004
YOUR SHELF, YOU CAN AVOID BEING
A HAVE NOT FOR THE REST OF THE

18:25.037 --> 18:25.305
SUMMER.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.072
>> WOW.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.074
>> NO MORE SLEEPING ON SPIKES.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.911
>> BUT YOU'LL IMMEDIATELY
ELIMINATE YOURSELF FROM THE VETO

18:31.944 --> 18:33.045
COMPETITION.

18:33.079 --> 18:39.319
ONCE ONE PERSON CLAIMS THE
GOLDEN STARFISH, THE REST ARE

18:39.352 --> 18:39.952
OUT.

18:39.986 --> 18:47.294
WHO IS READY TO PLAY TO WIN?

18:47.327 --> 18:50.997
>> GOOD LUCK, BITCHES.

18:51.030 --> 18:58.971
[HORN SOUNDS]
COME ON, GUYS.

18:59.005 --> 19:02.175
>> I NEED TO WIN THIS VETO
COMPETITION BECAUSE EVERYONE IN

19:02.209 --> 19:03.976
THE HOUSE IS OUT THE GET ME.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.314
IF I DON'T WIN NOW AND I STAY ON
THE BLOCK, I'M GOING HOME FOR

19:07.347 --> 19:08.481
SURE.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.617
>> THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO
IS FILL UP MY AQUA CLOCK.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.220
THE MORE TIME I HAVE TO STACK,
THE BETTER ODDS I HAVE TO WIN

19:13.253 --> 19:16.022
THE POWER OF VETO.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.357
>> GOOD WORK, GOOD WORK.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.826
>> IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT THAT I
WIN THIS VETO COMPETITION.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.896
I JUST WANT THE TAKE MYSELF OFF
THE BLOCK, RELAX, AND PUT MY

19:23.930 --> 19:28.000
TOES IN THE SAND.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.336
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.570
GOOD JOB, JASON.

19:30.603 --> 19:35.141
>> I'M SPRINTING THROUGH THIS
WATER AND STOCKPILING STARFISH.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.577
I'M THINKING THERE'S A LIMITED
NUMBER OF STARFISH.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.413
IF I CAN GATHER MORE, I'LL HAVE
THIS THING IN THE BAG.

19:40.447 --> 19:44.984
SO I CAN KEEP MYSELF SAFE AND
SAVE ALEX, AS WELL.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.486
>> KEEP IT GOING, GUYS.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.186
KEEP IT GOING.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.922
YOU GOT IT.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.426
>> I REALLY WANT THE WIN THIS
VETO COMPETITION AND SEND ALEX

19:53.460 --> 19:54.661
PACKING.

19:54.694 --> 20:04.471
BUT AS SOON AS I SEE THAT GOLDEN
STARFISH, I HAVE TO GO FOR IT.

20:04.504 --> 20:10.710
>> RAVEN HAS LOCKED IN THE
TEMPTATION STARFISH AND IS OUT

20:10.743 --> 20:13.280
OF THIS COMPETITION.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.247
>> KEEP IT GOING.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.816
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.451
>> WHAT'S UP, JASON?

20:18.485 --> 20:23.055
>> THIS COMPETITION IS TOUGHER
THAN WOODPECKER LIPS.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.157
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE
SURFACE AREA.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.126
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOW MUCH
TIME YOU HAVE LEFT.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.996
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR
HANDS SHAKING UNDER THE HEAT OF

20:30.029 --> 20:30.863
THE MOMENT.

20:30.897 --> 20:35.902
IT'S INTENSE.

20:35.935 --> 20:40.307
>> GOOD JOB, CODY.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.275
>> GOOD JOB, MATT.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.576
KEEP IT UP.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.813
>> AS I'M PLAYING I'M TRYING TO
GRAB RANDOM STARFISH THAT ARE

20:46.846 --> 20:50.450
CLOSE TO ME AND JUST PUT THEM IN
A PILE.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.454
SO I'M THINKING THIS IS A STRONG
STRATEGY.

20:54.487 --> 20:58.558
>> I'M JUST GOING TO GRAB SOME
OF MATT'S STARS AND BRING THEM

20:58.591 --> 21:00.393
TO MY SIDE.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.928
WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.230
>> THANKS, MATT.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.866
>> DON'T WORRY, GUYS.

21:06.899 --> 21:14.341
>> KEEP PUMPING, KEEP PUMPING.

21:14.374 --> 21:18.811
>> THE STARS ARE NOT ALIGNING OR
STACKING UP FOR THESE GUYS.

21:18.845 --> 21:23.182
IT'S A MESS.

21:23.215 --> 21:29.522
>> COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO.

21:29.556 --> 21:36.529
>> LOOK, MATT, I KNOW YOU'RE A
HOT-LOOKING SALT-AND-PEPPER

21:36.563 --> 21:38.931
DUDE, BUT I THINK YOUR AGE IS
STARTING TO CATCH UP WITH THE

21:38.965 --> 21:40.733
BRAIN, BECAUSE YOU LOOK SUPER
CONFUSED.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.002
>> I HAVE TEN STARFISH STACKED.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.805
MY THINKING, THIS IS LIKE
BLACKJACK, IT'S IN THE GREAT,

21:45.838 --> 21:48.975
BUT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE
REST OF THE HOUSE MIGHT BUST.

21:49.008 --> 21:54.914
I JUST NEED THIS AQUA CLOCK TO
RUN OUT FASTER SO NONE OF MY

21:54.947 --> 21:57.384
STARFISH FALL.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.953
>> AND MATT IS CURRENTLY IN THE
LEAD WITH TEN STARFISH.

22:00.987 --> 22:12.098
>> YEAH, MATT.

22:12.131 --> 22:17.269
>> GOOD JOB, JASON.

22:17.303 --> 22:21.541
>> I FIGURED OUT THERE'S ONLY SO
MANY STARFISH YOU CAN STACK

22:21.574 --> 22:23.610
BEFORE THEY'RE HIGH ENOUGH IT
JUST BECOMES UNSTABLE.

22:23.643 --> 22:29.115
I DON'T NEED TO MAKE THE TRIPS
BACK AND FORTH TO MY AQUA POD.

22:29.148 --> 22:33.653
IT'S BEST TO FOCUS AND BUILD MY
PUZZLE AND LOCK IN MY SCORE.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.954
>> GOOD JOB, JASON.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.489
>> WAY TO GO, WAY TO GO.

22:36.523 --> 22:42.629
>> JASON TAKES THE LEAD WITH 14
STARFISH.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.597
>> STAY FOCUSED, GUYS.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.765
STAY FOCUSED.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.534
>> COME ON, JILLIAN, KEEP IT UP.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.102
>> IT'S BETWEEN ME, ALEX AND
CODY.

22:50.136 --> 22:54.273
I MAY BE BEHIND, BUT I CAN CATCH
UP AND I CAN MAYBE WITNESS

22:54.306 --> 22:56.776
THINGS.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.746
-- WIN THIS THING.

22:59.779 --> 23:03.249
>> YOU GOT IT.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.351
>> I THINK YOU'RE GOOD, CODY.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.587
>> 14 IS THE NUMBER TO BEAT.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.990
>> I KNOW JASON'S SCORE IS
LOCKED IN, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

23:11.023 --> 23:13.693
HE HAS ENOUGH STARS TO KEEP ME
IN THE GAME.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.227
I NEED TO KEEP GOING.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.697
I NEED TO BEAT CODY.

23:17.730 --> 23:23.770
>> YOU GOT THIS, CODY.

23:23.803 --> 23:27.940
>> I SEE THAT THERE'S ONLY A
COUPLE MINUTES LEFT.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.076
I LOOK OVER, AND ALEX IS DOING
WELL.

23:30.109 --> 23:33.446
IT MIGHT BE IN MY BEST INTEREST
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL AND LET

23:33.480 --> 23:36.716
HER TAKE THIS.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.317
>> THERE IT IS.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.919
>> KEEP GOING.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.589
>> THAT'S FINE, THAT'S FINE.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.557
>> CODY, YOU ARE GIVING UP.

23:44.591 --> 23:48.628
THIS WAS NEVER THE PLAN, AND
IT'S RAISING SOME MAJOR RED

23:48.661 --> 23:49.562
FLAGS IN MY HEAD.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.464
ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ALEX THE
WIN.

23:51.498 --> 23:55.334
>> CODY, COME ON.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.369
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, CODY?

23:57.403 --> 24:05.311
THESE STARFISH WON'T STACK
THEMSELVES.

24:05.344 --> 24:09.448
>> CODY LOCKS IN WITH TWO.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.717
>> YOU GOT IT.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.985
>> COME ON, CLOCK, LET'S DO
THIS.

24:13.019 --> 24:13.853
RUN IT OUT.

24:13.886 --> 24:14.854
>> CHILL.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.188
>> I HAVE NO CHILL.

24:16.222 --> 24:24.363
THIS IS A -- I HAVE 16 STARS UP.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.799
THAT'S THE MOST IN THIS
COMPETITION, BUT THIS WATER IS

24:26.833 --> 24:28.868
COMING OUT DRIP BY DRIP.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.803
IT'S LIKE WATCHING COFFEE BE
MADE.

24:30.837 --> 24:34.541
I'M LYING DYING.

24:34.574 --> 24:41.614
>> ALEX TAKES THE LEAD WITH 16
STARFISH.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.917
JILLIAN IS LOCKED IN AT TEN.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.721
CONGRATULATIONS, ALEX, WITH 16
STARS, ALEX HAS WON THE POWER OF

24:48.755 --> 24:52.759
VETO.

24:52.792 --> 24:57.997
>> HEY, CODY, YOU WANT THE SEE
MY SHOWMANCE, THE POWER OF VETO.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.198
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

24:59.231 --> 25:01.901
YOU AND THE OTHER SHOWMANCES ARE
GOING DOWN.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.772
THANKS, BABE.

25:05.805 --> 25:09.275
>> ALEX WINS, AND WHILE I'M
HAPPY FOR HER, I'M STILL STUCK

25:09.308 --> 25:14.581
ON THE BLOCK, AND I DON'T SEE IT
COMING TO AN END ANY TIME SOON.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.116
>> ALEX WINS THE VETO.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.652
I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY, BUT I CAN'T
SHOW IT.

25:19.686 --> 25:23.590
NOW ALEX CAN TAKE HERSELF OFF
THE BLOCK, AND I CAN GO AFTER

25:23.623 --> 25:25.792
SOMEONE IN THIS GAME THAT I
HAVEN'T REALLY TRUSTED FROM THE

25:25.825 --> 25:26.826
START.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.643
>> GOOD JOB.

25:43.676 --> 25:47.680
>> I JUST WON THE POWER OF VETO.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.949
I'M NOT SURE IF CODY JUST THREW
THIS CHALLENGE.

25:49.982 --> 25:54.053
I DON'T NEED NO MAN TO TAKE CARE
OF ME.

25:54.086 --> 25:57.089
GO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SHOWMANCE,
CODY, BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING LIKE

25:57.123 --> 25:57.757
YOU NEED SOME HELP.

25:57.790 --> 26:07.166
>> DID YOU LET ME WIN?

26:07.199 --> 26:12.071
>> I MADE A CHOICE TO LET ALEX
TAKE THIS COMPETITION.

26:12.104 --> 26:12.939
>> I TRUST YOU.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.173
>> PLEASE DO.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.743
>> I WANT THE MAKE A BIG GAME
MOVE AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO

26:16.776 --> 26:21.147
SEE IT COMING.

26:21.180 --> 26:25.051
>> I WAS SHOCKED, TO BE HONEST.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.855
I WASN'T EXPECTING CODY TO... I
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HIS STRATEGY.

26:28.888 --> 26:29.989
>> I DIDN'T EITHER.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.491
>> I WAS LIKE, CODY'S SMARTER
THAN THAT.

26:32.524 --> 26:35.962
>> AND THEN WHEN HE GAVE UP AT
THE END, THAT REALLY IRKED ME.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.063
>> I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

26:37.096 --> 26:41.467
>> IF IT WAS MEGAN OR JOSH, HE
WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN UP.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.303
I FEEL LIKE HE WANTED HER TO BE
PULLED OFF.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.405
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO
SEND HER HOME.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.942
>> YEAH.

26:49.976 --> 26:54.546
BUT THAT PUTS OUR GAME IN
JEOPARDY, SO WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU

26:54.580 --> 26:55.748
ON?

26:55.782 --> 27:00.787
I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS THAT CODY
THREW THIS VETO COMP, AND I'M

27:00.820 --> 27:01.821
REALLY ANGRY.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.123
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE HELL HE'S DOING.

27:04.156 --> 27:11.664
ALEX IS NOT ON OUR SIDE OF THE
HOUSE.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.666
>> GOOD JOB, AL.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.003
>> I THINK HE THREW IT.

27:17.036 --> 27:26.012
>> I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.346
>> I CAN'T SEE.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.147
I'M TOO SHORT.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.082
HE CAME AND TALKED TO ME
AFTERWARD.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.751
AND HE'S LIKE, I GOT A PLAN.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.754
I WAS LIKE... EVERYBODY SAW.

27:34.787 --> 27:39.692
>> NOW THAT SHE'S WON THE VETO,
I'M SUPER NERVOUS BECAUSE I'M AN

27:39.726 --> 27:40.359
ATHLETIC THREAT.

27:40.392 --> 27:41.961
I'M IN THE IN A SHOWMANCE.

27:41.994 --> 27:46.332
I'M NOT IN THE GROUPS THAT ARE
ESSENTIALLY LEADING THE PACK.

27:46.365 --> 27:57.143
I'M JUST A FREAKING SITTING
DUCK.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.813
>> SHE NEEDED TO GO HOME THIS
WEEK, BECAUSE IT JUST PUTS OUR

28:00.847 --> 28:02.081
ENTIRE PLAN IN JEOPARDY.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.216
>> I AGREE.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.185
>> YOU'RE CRAZY RIGHT NOW,
AREN'T YOU?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.119
>> I'M SO MAD.

28:07.153 --> 28:11.891
>> SO ALEX WIN THE VETO, THAT
WAS NOT GOOD.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.794
WE FELT VERY CONFIDENT GOING IN
WE COULD GET HER HOME THIS WEEK.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.362
NOW THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.131
SO THE PEOPLE I'M WORKING WITH
DEFINITELY NEED TO FIGURE OUT A

28:19.165 --> 28:22.401
NEW GAME PLAN.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.336
>> CAN I MAKE A QUICK POINT?

28:24.370 --> 28:25.671
WHO IS HER CLOSEST PERSON?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.707
>> JASON.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.810
JASON IS A GOOD OPTION BECAUSE
HE'S STRONG.

28:30.843 --> 28:36.048
>> YEAH, AGREED.

28:36.082 --> 28:36.949
ALSO A SHARP KID.

28:36.983 --> 28:45.224
I THINK WE --
>> YOU'RE 100% RIGHT.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.092
>> I COULD BE WRONG.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.127
>> I'M SAFE FOR THREE WEEKS.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.563
MY SOCIAL STRATEGY IS WORKING
FLAWLESSLY AND I GET TO PLAY

28:51.597 --> 28:52.799
PUPPET MASTER.

28:52.832 --> 28:57.003
I'M PRETTY SURE I WAS GOING TO
DIE AND GO TO HELL, BUT I'M NOT

28:57.036 --> 28:59.405
SO SURE NOW BECAUSE I MIGHT BE
IN HEAVEN.

28:59.438 --> 29:04.143
>> I THINK WE MIGHT NEED TO PAY
ATTENTION TO WHAT RAMSES HAS

29:04.176 --> 29:06.478
BEEN UP TO.

29:06.512 --> 29:07.814
HE'S BEEN PICKING UP INFORMATION
FROM EVERYBODY.

29:07.847 --> 29:13.185
>> PAUL IS TRYING TO PLAY ME
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, BUT IT'S

29:13.219 --> 29:14.686
ONLY MAKING ME DISLIKE HIM EVEN
MORE.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.288
>> I'M JUST THROWING THIS ON THE
TABLE.

29:16.322 --> 29:19.658
>> HE'S THE POISON IN OUR GROUP,
AND IF THIS GROUP IS GOING TO

29:19.691 --> 29:22.694
LAST, I NEED TO GET RID OF PAUL.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.979
>> I WANT TO HAVE A HEART TO
HEART WITHOUT EVERYONE ELSE

29:40.012 --> 29:41.647
AROUND.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.783
I WANT TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE
AND NOT ARGUE OR BE IN A WEIRD

29:44.817 --> 29:46.953
PLACE.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.988
>> I MEAN, I'M GOOD.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.990
I'VE MADE MY POSITION PRETTY
CLEAR ON ALEX.

29:51.023 --> 29:56.795
>> AND THAT'S FINE, BUT WHAT
THROUGH ME OFF IS THAT AT THE

29:56.829 --> 29:59.431
END OF THE COMP, YOU HAD TWO
MINUTES LEFT AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN

29:59.465 --> 30:00.599
TRY.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.601
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE YOU WANTED
HER TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF THE

30:02.634 --> 30:03.569
BLOCK.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.004
YOU'RE NOT THAT PERSON TO THROW
IN THE TOWEL.

30:05.037 --> 30:10.642
>> TRUST ME, I WANTED TO SWEEP
THIS WEEK AND HAVE CONTROL.

30:10.676 --> 30:13.745
>> I JUST THINK YOU WANTED HER
TO PULL YOURSELF OFF THE BLOCK

30:13.779 --> 30:16.215
SO YOU WOULDN'T BE THE ONE TO
SEND HER HOME.

30:16.248 --> 30:20.719
>> I THOUSAND PERCENT WANTED TO
WIN THAT.

30:20.752 --> 30:24.690
I DID TRY AS HARD AS I COULD FOR
ABOUT 28 MINUTES, AND ONCE I

30:24.723 --> 30:27.093
REALIZED ALEX WAS GOING TO
PROBABLY TAKE IT, I DIDN'T TRY

30:27.126 --> 30:29.828
AS HARD, BUT JESSICA IS
INTERROGATING ME.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.030
SHE KEEPS GRILLING.

30:31.063 --> 30:34.266
I JUST GOT TO HOLD FIRM AND KEEP
SOME INFORMATION TO MYSELF.

30:34.300 --> 30:38.604
>> EVERYONE ON THE SIDE OF THE
HOUSE OBVIOUSLY LOOKS AT YOU AS

30:38.637 --> 30:39.338
A LEADER.

30:39.371 --> 30:39.972
>> RIGHT.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.174
>> THAT'S COMPLETELY CLEAR.

30:42.208 --> 30:46.345
SO EVERYONE WANTS TO TRUST YOU,
BUT ALEX BEING AROUND PUTS

30:46.378 --> 30:48.680
EVERYBODY ELSE IN JEOPARDY.

30:48.714 --> 30:52.851
>> I'M SICK OF EVERYBODY BEING
WORRIED ABOUT ALEX.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.987
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ALEX AT
ALL.

30:55.021 --> 30:58.057
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY ELSE
IS.

30:58.090 --> 31:01.860
>> BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON
THAT CAN PUT A WRENCH IN OUR

31:01.894 --> 31:03.062
PLAN.

31:03.095 --> 31:06.765
FROM THE BEGINNING I'VE HAD MY
ISSUES WITH 58 EX, BUT CODY'S

31:06.798 --> 31:08.935
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IS MAKING
IT WORSE.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.438
I'M TRYING HAVE A COOL, CALM AND
COLLECTED CONVERSATION, EVEN

31:12.471 --> 31:14.806
THOUGH INSIDE MY EMOTIONS ARE
GOING INSANE.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.477
>> CAN WE MAYBE PLAY IT SAFE FOR
ONE MORE WEEK?

31:18.510 --> 31:22.614
>> I'M NOT EVER GOING TO PLAY IT
SAFE.

31:22.648 --> 31:34.393
EVER.

31:34.426 --> 31:39.798
>> WHAT'S UP, BIG GUY?

31:39.831 --> 31:43.635
>> I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU, A,
BEING THE FIRST H.O.H. IS

31:43.669 --> 31:45.938
HARDEST, B, HAVING TO NOMINATE
FOUR PEOPLE IS THE WORST.

31:45.972 --> 31:49.375
>> I WANT TO TALK TO CODY
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY

31:49.408 --> 31:53.145
CLUES OR HINTS THAT I HAVE THIS
PENDANT OF PROTECTION.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.949
SO I WANT TO FEEL HIM OUT AND
SEE WHAT HE'S THINKING FOR THESE

31:56.983 --> 32:00.719
NOMINATIONS.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.555
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?

32:03.589 --> 32:05.424
HAVE YOU BEEN NOTICING ANYTHING
WEIRD?

32:05.457 --> 32:13.966
HAVE YOU BEEN PICKING UP ON
ANYTHING?

32:14.000 --> 32:18.437
NOTHING?

32:18.470 --> 32:20.006
I DON'T WANT INFORMATION OUT OF
YOU.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.140
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.509
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING.

32:23.542 --> 32:29.948
THAT'S YOUR GAME PLAY.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.251
THIS GUY DOES NOT GIVE ANY
INFORMATION OUT.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.221
HE'S EMOTIONLESS, DOESN'T TALK,
AT THIS POINT THE TOOTHBRUSH IS

32:35.254 --> 32:39.625
MAKING MORE NOISE THAN HE, IS
BUT I JUST KIND OF FEEL THAT

32:39.658 --> 32:40.626
SOMETHING IS OFF.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.894
>> I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME, PICK
YOUR BRAIN.

32:42.928 --> 32:45.998
>> MY ACTIONS ARE GOING THE
SPEAK LOUDER THAN MY WORDS.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.699
THIS IS MY H.O.H. THIS WEEK.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.602
NOBODY IS GOING TO KNOW THAT I'M
PUTTING PAUL ON THE BLOCK UNTIL

32:50.636 --> 32:52.738
THE VETO MEETING, ESPECIALLY NOT
YOU, PAUL.

32:52.771 --> 33:05.984
>> SO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, DO WHAT
YOU GOT TO DO.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.887
>> ANY FEEL?

33:08.920 --> 33:13.192
>> AND IF IT'S NOT, IT'S GOING
TO BE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE

33:13.225 --> 33:14.026
BLUE.

33:14.060 --> 33:19.298
>> ARE YOU SURE?

33:19.331 --> 33:24.103
>> NO.

33:24.136 --> 33:28.307
>> AN HONEST ANSWER IS A GOOD
ONE, BUT I'M JUST ASKING FOR

33:28.340 --> 33:31.577
YOUR INTUITION FOR MY OWN
PARANOIA.

33:31.610 --> 33:36.448
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A
PROBLEM.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.517
>> SO IT'S NOT JUST ME?

33:38.550 --> 33:42.688
>> NOBODY REALLY HAS A SOLID
READ FROM CODY, BUT I FEEL GOOD

33:42.721 --> 33:45.991
WITH HIM, NOT SUPER WARM AND
FUZZY.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.161
HOPEFULLY HE PUTS UP JASON, AND
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A

33:49.195 --> 33:54.600
WIN.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.283
>> WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, MAN?

34:11.317 --> 34:12.451
>> NOTHING.

34:12.484 --> 34:17.022
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO
GET REAL, AND SO I WAS JUST

34:17.055 --> 34:19.525
GOING THE SEE IF YOU WERE
THINKING ABOUT PUTTING ME UP

34:19.558 --> 34:21.360
THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO GETTING
OFF.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.895
>> IF I PUT YOU UP YOU'RE,
GOING.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.532
>> YEAH, BECAUSE NOBODY IS GOING
TO VOTE FOR JILLIAN BECAUSE

34:26.565 --> 34:27.599
SHE'S NOT A THREAT.

34:27.633 --> 34:28.834
>> RIGHT.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.069
>> SO WHOEVER GOES ON THE BLOCK
NOW IS THE ONE THAT'S LEAVING.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.539
>> I AGREE.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.806
HERE'S WHAT I NEED TO HAPPEN.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.244
I JUST HAVE LIKE CERTAIN PEOPLE
THAT ARE CLOSE TO ME THAT I WANT

34:38.277 --> 34:39.478
THE PROTECT.

34:39.511 --> 34:45.617
I NEED YOU NEXT WEEK IF YOU GET
H.O.H. TO NOT PUT UP DOMINIQUE

34:45.651 --> 34:51.690
AND THEN THE COUPLES.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.125
>> BUT SEE IT'S HARD...

34:53.159 --> 34:56.061
>> I GET IT.

34:56.094 --> 35:00.599
IT'S A... THAT'S SEVEN PEOPLE,
INCLUDING MYSELF.

35:00.632 --> 35:05.937
THAT I'M WANTING TO PROTECT, BUT
I'M SAVING YOU THIS WEEK.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.940
EVERYONE WANTS YOU TO GO.

35:08.974 --> 35:11.510
I WANT TO PROTECT YOUR
INTERESTS, TOO.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.414
>> CODY'S PROPOSAL IS
UNREALISTIC, BUT I LITERALLY AM

35:15.447 --> 35:17.349
STANDING WITH MY BACK TO THE
CHUTE.

35:17.383 --> 35:22.020
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING OTHER THAN
THE I VIPIR 6 CHAIR.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.455
-- THE EVICTION CHAIR.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.657
SO I EITHER TAKE HIS DEAL OR
TAKE A CHAIR.

35:25.691 --> 35:28.694
>> I NEED YOU TO REALIZE THE
NAMES I DIDN'T MENTION.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.562
I DIDN'T MENTION CHRISTMAS.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.631
I DIDN'T MENTION PAUL.

35:32.664 --> 35:37.102
I'M GOING TO MAKE A MOVE THAT'S
GOING TO PROTECT YOUR NUMBERS

35:37.135 --> 35:40.839
AND THEN ALSO TAKE AWAY FROM
MINE.

35:40.872 --> 35:44.343
AND IT SOUNDS SO
COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT IT'S... IT

35:44.376 --> 35:46.412
WILL BE COOL.

35:46.445 --> 35:49.481
>> BETH PAUL AND CHRISTMAS ARE
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL, AND IF

35:49.515 --> 35:53.852
I'M GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT,
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG GAME.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.021
>> THAT'S GOOD.

35:56.054 --> 35:59.758
>> NOBODY'S GOING TO SEE IT
COMING.

35:59.791 --> 36:00.792
>> WE'RE GOOD.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.806
>> Announcer: IT'S TIME FOR
AMERICA'S VOTE.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.643
YOU CAN VOTE TO TEMPT A
HOUSEGUEST OF YOUR CHOICE INSIDE

36:17.676 --> 36:22.381
THE DEN OF TEMPTATION.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.082
EACH TEMPTATION OFFERS AN
ADVANTAGE THAT COULD HELP THEM

36:24.115 --> 36:27.085
IN THE GAME, BUT REMEMBER, IT
ALSO COMES WITH A CONSEQUENCE

36:27.118 --> 36:31.723
THAT WILL AFFECT ONE OR MORE OF
THEIR HOUSEGUESTS.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.926
THE SECOND TEMPTATION IS THE
RING OF REPLACEMENT.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.596
WHO DO YOU WANT TO RECEIVE THIS
WEEK'S TEMPTATION?

>> IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T TRUSTED
YOU, IT'S JUST YOU ARE RISKING A

37:21.640 --> 37:26.545
LOT, AND I WANT TO KEEP US HERE.

37:26.578 --> 37:30.282
AND I'M BEING PROTECTIVE OF
THAT.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.318
YOU SHOULD BE HERE BECAUSE YOU
DESERVE IT.

37:32.351 --> 37:37.989
>> WELL, ALEX -- I DID NOT MEAN
TO SAY THAT.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.091
I SCREWED UP.

37:40.125 --> 37:43.194
I MEAN, I'M RECKLESS.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.630
HE'S WHAT I DO.

37:44.663 --> 37:54.706
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN
APPRECIATE THAT OR NOT.

37:54.706 --> 38:04.783
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN
APPRECIATE THAT OR NOT.

38:12.090 --> 38:16.928
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR
THE VETO MEETING.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.965
>> I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT CODY IS GOING TO DO RIGHT

38:19.998 --> 38:21.099
NOW.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.535
HE REFUSES TO SHARE ANYTHING
WITH ANYONE FROM OUR GROUP.

38:23.569 --> 38:32.143
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN TODAY.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.913
>> THIS IS A VETO MEETING.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.215
JILLIAN AND I HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION, BUT I

38:37.248 --> 38:40.986
HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF
THE NOMINATIONS.

38:41.019 --> 38:49.628
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON MYSELF.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.164
CODY, SINCE I HAVE JUST VETOED
ONE OF YOUR NOMINATIONS FOR

38:53.198 --> 38:56.635
EVICTION, YOU WILL HAVE TO NAME
A NEW HOUSEGUEST AS A

38:56.668 --> 39:03.442
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

39:03.475 --> 39:08.313
>> SO I'VE KEPT THE BASELINE OF
NOT TELLING ANYBODY MY PERSONAL

39:08.346 --> 39:11.249
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE I WANTED
TO PIECE TOGETHER WHO I CAN

39:11.282 --> 39:14.920
TRUST AND WHO I CAN'T TRUST IN
THIS GAME, AND THERE IS ONE

39:14.953 --> 39:18.757
COMMON THREAD IN EACH OF THOSE
CONVERSATIONS, THERE IS SOMEONE

39:18.790 --> 39:23.829
THAT IS TRYING TO SOW DISLOYALTY
AND DISTRUST TOWARD MY GAME AND

39:23.862 --> 39:27.098
MYSELF, AND I TAKE THAT AS A
PERSONAL ATTACK, SO MY

39:27.132 --> 39:38.610
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE IS PAUL.

39:38.644 --> 39:53.559
TAKE A SEAT.

39:53.592 --> 40:01.933
>> WHAT IS THAT?

40:01.967 --> 40:12.010
>> HE GOT THE TEMPTATION.

40:12.010 --> 40:19.651
>> HE GOT THE TEMPTATION.

40:32.297 --> 40:35.867
>> LAST WEEK AMERICA TEMPTED ME
WITH A PENDENT OF PROTECTION AND

40:35.901 --> 40:36.968
I TOOK IT.

40:37.002 --> 40:40.405
THE PENDENT KEEPS ME SAFE FOR
THE NEXT THREE EVICTION,

40:40.438 --> 40:41.406
THEREFORE I CANNOT BE NOMINATED.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.709
>> OH, MY GOD.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.210
>> SORRY, CODY.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.713
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PICK A NEW REPLACEMENT

40:47.746 --> 40:58.624
NOMINEE.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.526
>> CHRISTMAS, YOU GOT SCREWED.

41:00.559 --> 41:10.669
TAKE A SEAT.

41:10.669 --> 41:17.008
TAKE A SEAT.

41:17.676 --> 41:24.382
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:24.415 --> 41:29.755
>> APPRECIATE YOU'RE A STRAIGHT
SHOOTER.

41:29.788 --> 41:30.689
NICE JOB.

41:30.722 --> 41:32.591
>> NOW I KNOW WHO I CAN TRUST IN
THIS HOUSE.

41:32.624 --> 41:36.895
>> OH, SO THIS WAS YOUR AGENDA
TO, TRY TO BACK DOOR THE VET?

41:36.928 --> 41:38.396
REAL ORIGINAL, BUDDY.

41:38.429 --> 41:42.734
YOU JUST SHOWED YOUR CARDS TO
THE ENTIRE HOUSE, SO GUESS WHAT,

41:42.768 --> 41:45.403
CODY, I'M GOING TO PLAY THE
VICTIM AND TURN THIS TABLE REAL

41:45.436 --> 41:46.605
QUICK.

41:46.638 --> 41:50.709
>> MY SIDE OF THE HOUSE JUST
SPLIT IN TWO, AND I HAVE NO IDEA

41:50.742 --> 41:52.277
WHERE I'M GOING TO LAND IN THIS.

41:52.310 --> 41:55.681
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, CODY?

41:55.714 --> 41:58.483
>> HOW COULD ANYBODY EVEN
STRATEGIZE AT THIS POINT?

41:58.516 --> 42:01.853
I HAVE HAD TO PUT A THIRD OF THE
HOUSE UP FOR NOMINATION SO FAR.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.556
THIS IS THE WORST TWIST THAT
COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO ME

42:04.590 --> 42:05.323
RIGHT NOW.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.560
IT'S GAME ON BETWEEN ME AND
PAUL.

42:08.594 --> 42:12.163
>> CODY NOMINATES CHRISTMAS, AND
THIS IS THE FOURTH PERSON THAT I

42:12.197 --> 42:15.567
HAVE TO BE ON THE BLOCK AGAINST,
AND LET ME TELL YOU, I AM NOT

42:15.601 --> 42:17.535
GOING ANYWHERE.

42:17.569 --> 42:20.205
>> I AM ABSOLUTELY BLIND SIDED.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.341
PAUL IS BLIND SIDED BECAUSE CODY
YOU ABSOLUTELY PULLED THE RUG

42:23.374 --> 42:26.678
OUT FROM ALL OF US, SO YOU BEST
BELIEVE THAT I'M GOING TO

42:26.712 --> 42:29.848
