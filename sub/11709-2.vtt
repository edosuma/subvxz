{\an8}- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:41.770 --> 08:44.440

{\an8}I'M TALKING TO THE KID

{\an8}HE SWORE ON HIS MOTHER.
- SO I WAS WRONG.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.494

THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.451
{\an8}YOU KNOW

16:34.535 --> 16:38.247
{\an8}CAN WE LIKE, UH, LIKE,
RESCHEDULE THIS PIECE?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.415
{\an8}- YEAH.
- [inaudible]

16:39.498 --> 16:40.749
{\an8}- Y'ALL GONNA HATE US
OR WHAT?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.251
{\an8}- I'M NOT A HATER.
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.001
{\an8}ME NEITHER.
- I NEVER HATE.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.878
{\an8}- I WANNA CALL YOU TOMORROW.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.630
{\an8}IF YOU ACT
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW ME,

16:46.714 --> 16:47.881
{\an8}I'M GONNA COME
TO STATEN ISLAND.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.259
{\an8}- SO LET'S DO
LIKE A CHILL NIGHT.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.593
{\an8}- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.429
{\an8}- WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEAL THE...
I MEAN, CHILL.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.265
{\an8}- THAT BETTER BE
THE RIGHT NUMBER, TOO.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.101
{\an8}- YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT PHONE
ISN'T TURNED ON.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.227
{\an8}- I'M GONNA CALL RIGHT NOW.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.730
{\an8}- CALL US ONCE YOU GET
THE SITUATION FIXED,

17:02.813 --> 17:03.939
{\an8}YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

17:04.021 --> 17:05.941
{\an8}- I'M JOKING WITH Y'ALL.
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.526
{\an8}YO, GOOD NIGHT, GIRLS.
- GOOD NIGHT.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.737
{\an8}- BE SAFE DRIVING HOME.
- THANK YOU.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.989
{\an8}- THAT WAS A GOOD EXIT.
THAT WAS A GOOD EXIT.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.324
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- YEAH, WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.909
{\an8}THANKS FOR COVERING MY BACK.
- THAT WAS A GOOD EXIT.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.579
{\an8}- I SAW YOU
CRYING LAST NIGHT.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.289
{\an8}- HE'S LIKE A PART OF ME.
SO I...

17:20.372 --> 17:21.498
{\an8}- HE'S NOT A PART OF YOU.
YOU ARE SEPARATE PEOPLE.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.625
{\an8}- I KNOW.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.501
{\an8}- THAT'S AN UNHEALTHY
RELATIONSHIP.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.795
{\an8}- ME AND JIONNI
SHOULD BE FRIENDS.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.464
{\an8}- OKAY.
- WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE IN COMMON?

17:28.547 --> 17:32.509
{\an8}- WE'RE ESKIMO BROTHERS, BRO.
- YOU ARE SUCH A PERV.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.812
{\an8}- AS I'M WAKING UP RIGHT NOW,

17:43.896 --> 17:47.441
{\an8}I'M ACTUALLY
FEELING PRETTY GOOD.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.567
{\an8}- I DON'T WANNA DRINK
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.194
{\an8}MY HEAD HURTS.

17:50.277 --> 17:50.986
{\an8}- THE ONE THING
THAT I DON'T MISS

17:51.069 --> 17:53.655
{\an8}IS LAYING IN BED
AND BEING, LIKE,

17:53.739 --> 17:56.158
{\an8}"OH, GOD, I'M HUNG-OVER,
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER."

17:56.241 --> 17:57.993
{\an8}AND I DON'T
WANNA GET UP, YOU KNOW?

17:58.076 --> 18:01.038
{\an8}NOW I WAKE UP
AND I'M JUST EXCELLENT.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.958
{\an8}- I THINK I'M GONNA
SKIP THE GYM TODAY.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.293
{\an8}- OKAY.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.504
{\an8}- SUNDAY WILL BE MY SKIP DAY.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.674
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE
PUNCHED ME IN MY EYES.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.676
{\an8}- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WAS CRYING.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.636
{\an8}- OH, I KNOW YOU WERE.

18:15.719 --> 18:16.637
{\an8}- YEAH, I THINK,
LIKE, I FELL ON VINNY

18:16.720 --> 18:18.722
{\an8}A COUPLE OF TIMES.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.308
{\an8}- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU WERE CRYING?

18:21.391 --> 18:21.934
{\an8}YEAH. 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO LEAVE HIM.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.394
{\an8}- WERE YOU CRYING? WHY?

18:24.478 --> 18:25.854
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANNA LEAVE HIM.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.314
{\an8}- HOW WAS THE CLUB, THOUGH?

18:27.397 --> 18:29.316
{\an8}- IT WAS FUN.
- IT WAS PERFECT.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.692
{\an8}- I HEARD THE MUSIC.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.236
{\an8}- I WAS TRYING
TO LOOK FOR YOU.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.238
{\an8}- I WAS, LIKE DANCING
IN THE BOOTH AND, LIKE...

18:34.321 --> 18:36.990
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I WANTED
JIONNI TO MEET CHRIS.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.951
{\an8}I THINK NEXT TIME I SEE HIM
I'LL BE BETTER.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.911
{\an8}- BUT YOU CRIED WHEN HE LEFT?
- YEAH.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.455
{\an8}- NO, SHE CRIED
UP UNTIL HE LEFT AND AFTER.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.791
{\an8}- WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
'CAUSE WE WERE DRUNK TOO.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.543
{\an8}IT DOESN'T HELP.
IT MAKES IT WORSE.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.379
{\an8}LIKE, I GET IT,
DEENA REALLY DOES MISS CHRIS,

18:50.462 --> 18:52.714
{\an8}BUT I'M PREGNANT,
MY HORMONES ARE GOING CRAZY,

18:52.798 --> 18:53.757
{\an8}I'M NOT WITH MY FIANCE,

18:53.841 --> 18:56.051
{\an8}AND I'M NOT CRYING.

18:56.134 --> 18:57.970
{\an8}IT'S KIND OF CRAZY PANTS.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.264
{\an8}- BUT I DO--EVEN THOUGH I CRIED,
I FEEL BETTER THAT I SAW HIM.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.390
{\an8}- I'M ALL CONGESTED.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.224
{\an8}- I FEEL GREAT.
- YEAH.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.685
{\an8}- YOU ONLY SLEPT
LIKE 17 HOURS.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.562
{\an8}- I WENT TO BED AT, LIKE, 1:30.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.021
{\an8}AND YOU GUYS CAME HOME

19:08.105 --> 19:10.399
{\an8}AND THEN I COULDN'T SLEEP
FOR, LIKE, ANOTHER TWO HOURS.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.693
{\an8}- NO.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.861
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- [puking]

19:13.944 --> 19:14.736
{\an8}- OH, GROSS.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.656
{\an8}- DEENA?
- COMING.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.867
{\an8}THROWING UP?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.368
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO STOP.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.703
{\an8}- DID YOU
HEAR HIM THIS MORNING?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.663
{\an8}- YEAH,
I WAS, LIKE, EW.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.915
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD GO TO E.J.'S
AND GET A BEER.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.918
{\an8}[laughing]

19:30.002 --> 19:31.211
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.213
{\an8}- YOU WANNA GO EAT?
- WHERE'S EVERYONE?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.047
{\an8}I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
IF I WAS MEAN LAST NIGHT.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.675
{\an8}- YOU WERE?
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:36.758 --> 19:38.886
{\an8}- I BLACKED OUT.
- YOU WERE VERY MEAN TO ME.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.220
{\an8}- OH.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.013
{\an8}- PROBABLY YOU DID SOMETHING
THAT PROBABLY PISSED ME OFF

19:41.096 --> 19:42.389
{\an8}AND YOU THINK YOU DIDN'T.

19:42.472 --> 19:46.894
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN THINK RON
KNOWS WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT

19:46.977 --> 19:48.228
{\an8}TO GET
TO WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.229
{\an8}- I HATE BEING THAT DRUNK.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.231
{\an8}I'M FUCKING
MISERABLE RIGHT NOW.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.608
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?
- LET'S EAT.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.942
{\an8}BABE, YOU READY?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.110
{\an8}- WHERE
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA EAT?

19:55.193 --> 19:57.905
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA GO
TO BEACH BARK.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.451
{\an8}YESTERDAY
WAS NOT MY DAY.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.911
{\an8}I CAN TELL YOU
THAT MUCH, BRO.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.705
{\an8}- RON WAS BOMBED.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.582
{\an8}- I DON'T REMEMBER GOING TO
STEAKS, BRO. HOW ABOUT THAT?

20:08.665 --> 20:10.292
{\an8}I DON'T REMEMBER
GOING TO STEAKS,

20:10.375 --> 20:11.668
{\an8}I DON'T REMEMBER WALKING HOME.
I DON'T REMEMBER GETTING HOME.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.086
{\an8}I HATE GETTING LIKE THAT.

20:13.170 --> 20:13.795
{\an8}- I GRABBED YOU AT ONE POINT
OUTSIDE--YOU ALMOST FELL.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.548
{\an8}- YEAH?
- YEAH.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.342
{\an8}- I CUT MY LEG.
I MUST HAVE FELL SOMEWHERE.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.638
{\an8}ACHILLES HURT. WAS I
DANCING AT ALL LAST NIGHT?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.432
{\an8}- UM, I DID SEE A LITTLE.
YOU AND VINNY WERE.

20:25.515 --> 20:29.394
{\an8}- WERE WE? DID WE?
- IN CIRCLES.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.145
{\an8}- I WISH
I REMEMBERED THAT.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.356
{\an8}IT'S KINDA MESSED UP

20:32.439 --> 20:33.523
{\an8}THAT MIKE'S THE SOBER ONE

20:33.607 --> 20:35.984
{\an8}FILLING IN MY HOLES
ON WHAT HAPPENED.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.486
{\an8}I'M JUST, LIKE,
I WISH I WAS THERE,

20:37.569 --> 20:41.365
{\an8}BECAUSE IT KINDA
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.576
{\an8}- I CAN'T BELIEVE, LIKE, FOOD
MAKES ME FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.996
{\an8}I USED TO, YOU KNOW, NEED
SOMETHING ELSE, YOU KNOW?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.498
{\an8}- WELL, IT'S GOOD
YOU SNAPPED OUT OF IT.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.416
{\an8}- YEAH.
- IT'S REAL GOOD.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.210
{\an8}I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
COMMEND YOU FOR THAT.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.337
{\an8}- I WOULDN'T WISH IT
ON MY WORST ENEMY.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.838
{\an8}IT'S HORRIBLE.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.882
{\an8}- IT'S HARDER TO GO OUT THERE,
TOO, WHEN YOU SNAP BACK.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.342
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIX YOURSELF BACK

21:00.425 --> 21:02.177
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU FORGOT
HOW YOU WERE BEFORE.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.012
{\an8}AND, LITTLE BY LITTLE,
IT COMES BACK.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.389
{\an8}IT'S LIKE A LITTLE KID

21:05.472 --> 21:06.181
{\an8}FINDING
HOW TO WALK AGAIN ALMOST.

21:06.264 --> 21:07.516
{\an8}- HE'S BACK TO, LIKE--

21:07.599 --> 21:10.143
{\an8}- HE'S BETTER THAN HE WAS
THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.687
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.646
{\an8}- LIKE, I LIKE HIM MORE NOW
THAN WHEN I FIRST MET HIM.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.815
{\an8}- YEAH.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.483
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, I LIKE
THE WAY MIKE IS RIGHT NOW.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.776
{\an8}IT'S GOOD TO SEE HIM CLEAN,

21:17.859 --> 21:19.069
{\an8}IT'S GOOD TO SEE HIM
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.863
{\an8}BUT THIS HOUSE CAN REALLY
FUCK YOU UP IN SO MANY WAYS

21:21.947 --> 21:22.990
{\an8}AND MIKE NEEDS TO BE STRONG

21:23.073 --> 21:25.617
{\an8}BECAUSE MIKE'S
DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE

21:25.701 --> 21:27.035
{\an8}A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF HIM.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.206
{\an8}- IT'S ALMOST LIKE
EVERY DAY YOU LOOK AT THE SKY

21:31.289 --> 21:33.125
{\an8}AND IT'LL BE BLUE AND YOU'RE,
LIKE, "HOLY SHIT, IT'S BLUE."

21:33.208 --> 21:34.960
{\an8}LIKE, YOU NEVER
NOTICED IT BEFORE.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.628
{\an8}LIKE, YOU JUST FLY BY LIFE

21:36.712 --> 21:38.046
{\an8}AND YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT NOTHING.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.256
{\an8}- IT'S LIVING
IN YOUR OWN MIND STATE.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.259
{\an8}- ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT HERE.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.970
{\an8}- I THINK MIKE BEING SOBER
IS AN AMAZING THING.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.138
{\an8}HE'S WALKING INTO THIS HOUSE

21:46.221 --> 21:48.348
{\an8}WITH A NEW, POSITIVE
OUTLOOK ON THINGS.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.267
{\an8}LIKE, AND I COULDN'T
BE MORE PROUD.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.020
{\an8}- THIS GUY'S RIPPED
FOR A FUCKING OLD MAN.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.354
{\an8}I WANNA LOOK LIKE HIM
WHEN I GET OLDER.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.732
{\an8}SHIT.
FUCKING GUY WAS RIPPED.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.317
{\an8}HOLY SHIT.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.904
{\an8}- ♪ THERE'S A PARTY,
AND EVERYONE'S INVITED ♪

22:02.988 --> 22:04.990
{\an8}♪ WHOA OH,
CALL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ♪

22:05.073 --> 22:06.783
{\an8}♪ EVERYONE'S INVITED ♪

22:06.867 --> 22:08.035
{\an8}- WHERE IS EVERYONE?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.244
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:09.327 --> 22:11.246
{\an8}- CLEANING MY SHOES.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.081
{\an8}I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU STARTED CRYING LAST NIGHT.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.374
{\an8}- WHAT, IN THE CLUB?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.917
{\an8}- YEAH.
- I KNOW.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.587
{\an8}- THAT WAS THE MOST
UNEXPECTED CRY EVER.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.756
{\an8}- I APOLOGIZE.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.175
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHY
I THINK I GOT LIKE THAT?

22:23.258 --> 22:24.760
{\an8}HE'S, LIKE,
MY BEST FRIEND,

22:24.843 --> 22:29.097
{\an8}HE'S, LIKE--LIKE,
A PART OF ME, SO LIKE...

22:29.181 --> 22:30.766
{\an8}I JUST LOOK OUT FOR HIM
AND I'M AFRAID, LIKE--

22:30.849 --> 22:31.933
{\an8}- BUT HE'S NOT
A PART OF YOU, THOUGH.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.685
{\an8}- I KNOW.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.396
{\an8}- YOU'RE BOTH
TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.857
{\an8}- I KNOW, BUT
I JUST LOOK OUT FOR HIM.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.108
{\an8}- THAT'S AN UNHEALTHY
RELATIONSHIP.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.944
{\an8}THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES
OF UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.362
{\an8}THERE'S ONE TYPE
THAT'S, LIKE,

22:44.446 --> 22:45.072
{\an8}PEOPLE
WHO FIGHT EACH OTHER,

22:45.155 --> 22:46.156
{\an8}AND THERE'S ANOTHER TYPE

22:46.239 --> 22:49.242
{\an8}WHERE YOU BECOME
JUST ADDICTED

22:49.326 --> 22:51.953
{\an8}AND YOU CAN'T GO ON
WITHOUT THE OTHER PERSON.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.622
{\an8}- I JUST THINK TOO MUCH.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.790
{\an8}I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.710
{\an8}I GET, LIKE, ANXIOUS
AND THAT'S WHEN, LIKE--

22:58.794 --> 22:59.795
{\an8}I GET, LIKE, PANICKY.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.048
{\an8}THEN I'M LIKE,
SHOULD I GO ON, LIKE--

23:03.131 --> 23:04.049
{\an8}- MEDICINE?
- ANXIETY MEDICINE?

23:04.132 --> 23:06.218
{\an8}I THINK I HAVE
A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.053
{\an8}- CAN YOU STOP SAYING

23:08.136 --> 23:08.804
{\an8}YOU THINK YOU HAVE
THIS AND THAT?

23:08.887 --> 23:09.971
{\an8}- I KNOW.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.431
{\an8}LIKE, IT SUCKS, LIKE--

23:11.515 --> 23:14.267
{\an8}I SAW HIM
AND I WAS HAPPY AND I CRIED.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.769
{\an8}LIKE, THAT SUCKS.

23:15.852 --> 23:19.272
{\an8}- DEENA HASN'T BEEN AWAY
FROM THIS KID FOR LIKE A DAY.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.483
{\an8}AND IT'S HEALTHY
TO EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS,

23:21.566 --> 23:23.360
{\an8}BUT YOU HAVE
TO THINK POSITIVE.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.153
{\an8}IT'S JUST A BOYFRIEND,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.738
{\an8}- YOU LIKE HIM?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.240
{\an8}- DEENA, SHUT UP!

23:28.323 --> 23:29.491
{\an8}- I LIKE TALKING ABOUT HIM.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.035
{\an8}- JESUS CHRIST.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.204
{\an8}- IT'S STARTING TO DRIZZLE.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.206
{\an8}- [sighs] OH.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.294
{\an8}- WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO TODAY?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.338
{\an8}- YO, I GOT PEDICURED TOES.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.756
{\an8}VINNY LIKES TO PUT
MY FEET IN HIS MOUTH

23:44.840 --> 23:46.883
{\an8}SO HE MADE ME
GET A PEDICURE.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.260
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S KINDA VISUAL.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.719
{\an8}- THE WEATHER'S KINDA SHITTY,

23:49.803 --> 23:51.680
{\an8}SO I'M NOT SURE
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TONIGHT

23:51.763 --> 23:53.348
{\an8}BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY
NOT MUCH TO DO

23:53.431 --> 23:54.808
{\an8}WHEN IT'S SHITTY OUT.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.018
{\an8}- DID YOU CHOOSE A DAY WHEN
YOU'RE GONNA GET MARRIED?

23:57.102 --> 23:58.019
{\an8}- NO.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.354
{\an8}FOR THE WEDDING YET?

23:59.437 --> 24:00.605

24:00.689 --> 24:03.024
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT? ME

24:03.108 --> 24:06.153
{\an8}- WELL, IF YOU KEEP
JOKING AROUND LIKE YOU ARE...

24:06.236 --> 24:08.488
{\an8}- LIKE I'M WHAT, THE FATHER?

24:08.572 --> 24:10.574
{\an8}- YEAH, IT'S REALLY

BUT IT'S KINDA DISRESPECTFUL.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.791

24:19.875 --> 24:21.168

{\an8}A LOT OF US IN THIS HOUSE
ARE ESKIMO BROTHERS.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.138
{\an8}WE ALL ARE.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.723
{\an8}- YOU'RE SUCH A PERV.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.057
{\an8}- DO YOU GO

24:36.141 --> 24:37.225
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GO.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.560
{\an8}- CAN I GO?

24:38.643 --> 24:39.644
{\an8}- SHIT.
I WANNA GO.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.355
{\an8}- RONNIE'S GOING
- RON'S COMING WITH ME.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.399
{\an8}- OH, COME ON.

24:44.482 --> 24:47.110
{\an8}THE JOKE'S OVER.
I'M NOT THE FATHER, OKAY?

24:47.194 --> 24:48.486
{\an8}ME AND SNOOKI HAD SEX

24:48.570 --> 24:49.613
{\an8}FOR, LIKE,
HALF A SECOND BY THE WAY.

24:49.696 --> 24:49.988
{\an8}- YOU DID?

24:50.071 --> 24:52.157
{\an8}- RIGHT?

24:53.992 --> 24:55.410
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, VINNY'S
DEFINITELY PUSHING

24:55.493 --> 24:56.995
{\an8}NICOLE'S BUTTONS RIGHT NOW.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.955
{\an8}AND IF VINNY KEEPS THIS UP,

24:59.039 --> 25:00.916
{\an8}HE'S GONNA GET
PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE

25:00.999 --> 25:01.625
{\an8}AND HE'S GONNA BE
OUT OF THE WEDDING.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.422
{\an8}- CAN WE JUST GO TO BED NOW?

25:07.505 --> 25:09.216
{\an8}- I HONESTLY WANTED
TO GET A KNIFE LAST NIGHT

25:09.299 --> 25:12.093
{\an8}AND JUST CUT VINNY'S THROAT.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.678
{\an8}- THINK I'M GONNA BE CELIBATE.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.430
{\an8}I HAVE MADE A DECISION

25:15.513 --> 25:17.849
{\an8}TO TRY TO REMAIN
CELIBATE THIS SUMMER.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.059
{\an8}- THAT'S STUPID.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.778
{\an8}- GIRLS, IT'S 10:00!

25:29.861 --> 25:32.614
{\an8}- SO, THIS MORNING I'M WORKING
WITH PAULIE AND DEENA,

25:32.697 --> 25:35.700
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
GONNA KILL IT TOGETHER.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.786
{\an8}- WE'RE, LIKE,
SO GONNA BE LATE,

25:37.869 --> 25:39.204
{\an8}IT'S, LIKE,
NOT EVEN FUNNY.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.374
{\an8}I LOOK LIKE
A PIECE OF SAUSAGE

25:42.457 --> 25:43.291
{\an8}NEXT TO THESE TWO MEATBALLS.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.002
{\an8}LONG AND THIN IN THE MIDDLE.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.003
{\an8}WE'LL LOOK LIKE A BIG DICK.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.713
{\an8}- GOOD MORNING.
- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

25:48.797 --> 25:50.715
{\an8}CUTTING IT CLOSE.
TWO MINUTES TO SPARE.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.717
{\an8}- I WANNA MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE SHIT

25:52.801 --> 25:53.843
{\an8}THAT I GAVE DANNY,

25:53.927 --> 25:55.428
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
THESE PAST SUMMERS.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.305
{\an8}HOPE THIS FITS ME.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.890
{\an8}I REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA BE, LIKE,

25:58.974 --> 26:00.475
{\an8}A REALLY GOOD
EMPLOYEE THIS SUMMER.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.935
{\an8}CAN WE GET BREAKFAST?

26:02.018 --> 26:03.728
{\an8}- COME ON, GUYS.
IT'S YOUR FIRST SHIFT.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.980
{\an8}- SQUIRT!

26:05.063 --> 26:06.273
{\an8}- TRY TO BE A LITTLE
MORE RESPONSIBLE.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.817
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA BE A MOTHER.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.778
{\an8}THANKS FOR SHOWING UP, GUYS.
[laughter]

26:11.861 --> 26:13.989
{\an8}- DANNY? CAN I TALK TO YOU?
- YES?

26:14.072 --> 26:15.365
{\an8}THIS IS USUALLY THE CONVERSATION
I HAVE WITH YOU.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.992
{\an8}- WHAT DID I DO?
- NO, YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.326
{\an8}- I'M NOT IN TROUBLE?
- NO.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.953
{\an8}- WHERE DO YOU WANNA TALK?

26:20.036 --> 26:21.246
{\an8}- SO, I KINDA NEED ADVICE

26:21.329 --> 26:24.207
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M, LIKE, CONFUSED
AND A LITTLE CONCERNED

26:24.291 --> 26:25.041
{\an8}ABOUT JUST
LIVING IN THE HOUSE,

26:25.125 --> 26:27.711
{\an8}LIKE, WITH GETTING REST

26:27.794 --> 26:31.214
{\an8}AND JUST HAVING,
LIKE, ALONE TIME TO...

26:31.298 --> 26:32.674
{\an8}- BE PREGNANT.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN

26:32.757 --> 26:34.843
{\an8}'CAUSE I KNOW THEY COME HOME
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING AND...

26:34.926 --> 26:36.761
{\an8}- YEAH.
- THEY'RE UP TILL 6:00.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.388
{\an8}- YEAH, I MEAN, I STILL
WANNA BE WITH MY ROOMMATES

26:38.471 --> 26:39.556
{\an8}AND HANG OUT.

26:39.639 --> 26:40.181
{\an8}I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM THE HOUSE.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.475
{\an8}I WANNA BE HEALTHY,

26:42.559 --> 26:43.476
{\an8}SO I HOPE
DANNY CAN HELP ME OUT.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.022
{\an8}DO YOU HAVE,
LIKE, ANOTHER PLACE?

26:47.105 --> 26:48.481
{\an8}- I HAVE A COUPLE
OF OTHER PLACES

26:48.565 --> 26:49.941
{\an8}WHERE EVERYONE
THAT WORKS FOR ME LIVES

26:50.025 --> 26:51.192
{\an8}IN ALL THESE
DIFFERENT HOUSE AND STUFF,

26:51.276 --> 26:52.652
{\an8}BUT IT'S SUMMERTIME

26:52.736 --> 26:53.611
{\an8}SO EVERYTHING'S
PRETTY MUCH FILLED UP.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.865
{\an8}- I JUST NEED
A BED AND A SHOWER.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.409
{\an8}- I HAVE THE APARTMENT
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

26:59.492 --> 27:03.705
{\an8}WHAT I COULD DO
IS MAYBE MOVE YOU IN.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.206
{\an8}IT'S NOT WHAT I WANNA DO,

27:05.290 --> 27:07.125
{\an8}BUT I KNEW SOMETHING--

27:07.208 --> 27:08.460
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.586

{\an8}IT'S A PARTY HOUSE.
- MM-HMM.

27:11.838 --> 27:12.714
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, AND YOU'RE NOT
READY TO PARTY ANYMORE.

27:12.797 --> 27:13.715

27:21.473 --> 27:23.767
{\an8}DANNY DOES UNDERSTAND
AND HE'S THERE FOR ME.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.019
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
IT JUST MEANS THAT HE CARES.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.729

37:45.930 --> 37:47.014
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.308
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.143
{\an8}- LIKE DO YOU--
- I ALREADY STOPPED, THOUGH.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.353
{\an8}- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M NOT GONNA BE HERE.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.187
{\an8}LIKE, I DEFINITELY
WANNA HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.271
{\an8}I WANT TO MOVE
OUT OF THE HOUSE

37:54.355 --> 37:56.899
{\an8}BECAUSE I DON'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE AT ALL

37:56.983 --> 37:59.735
{\an8}LIVING IN A PARTY HOUSE WHILE
I'M SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.447
{\an8}I FEEL, LIKE, IT'S JUST
NOT HEALTHY FOR A BABY

38:03.531 --> 38:07.034
{\an8}SO I JUST WANT MY OWN PLACE
WHERE IT'S NICE AND CLEAN

38:07.118 --> 38:08.286
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING ELSE

38:08.369 --> 38:10.329
{\an8}I'LL BE WITH THE ROOMMATES FOR.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.580
{\an8}- WE'LL STILL DO
ALL OUR ERRANDS TOGETHER.

38:11.664 --> 38:15.167
{\an8}- YEAH, IT'S JUST
SOMEWHERE FOR ME TO GET REST.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.044
{\an8}- LIKE, LAST NIGHT.
WE PROBABLY CAME HOME--

38:17.128 --> 38:18.004
{\an8}WE WERE LOUD AND STUFF.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.130
{\an8}- YEAH, I WAS UP
FOR A GOOD TWO HOURS.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.131
{\an8}- YOU KNOW?
SO IT'S LIKE--

38:20.214 --> 38:22.508
{\an8}- I OBJECT.
NO, I'M KIDDING.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.218
{\an8}- BUT YOU UNDERSTAND?
- I'M GONNA BE UPSET.

38:24.301 --> 38:26.887
{\an8}- LIKE, I'M NOT BEING
AN ASSHOLE ABOUT IT.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.973
{\an8}- DAMN, I DON'T LIKE THIS.

38:29.056 --> 38:30.141
{\an8}- WE'LL SEE HER EVERY
WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAY, BRO.

38:30.224 --> 38:30.891
{\an8}- STOP BEING SELFISH.
- NO.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.728
{\an8}- THINK ABOUT LORENZO.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.062
{\an8}- IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.397
{\an8}- ME AND NICOLE HAVE BEEN
SLEEPING IN THE SAME ROOM

38:36.480 --> 38:37.565
{\an8}NEXT TO EACH OTHER

38:37.648 --> 38:39.317
{\an8}FOR SIX BEDROOMS NOW.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.736
{\an8}AND IT'S SAD THAT SHE'S
NOT GONNA BE THERE.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.071
{\an8}BUT IT'S NOT
NICOLE THAT HAS TO LEAVE,

38:44.155 --> 38:45.740
{\an8}IT'S LORENZO
THAT HAS TO LEAVE.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.241
{\an8}THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

38:47.324 --> 38:48.409
{\an8}I GOTTA SUCK IT UP.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.622
{\an8}- JUST DON'T
FORGET ABOUT ME IF I--

38:53.706 --> 38:54.665
{\an8}- WE WON'T FORGET ABOUT YOU.

38:54.749 --> 38:55.916
{\an8}- CRAP!

38:56.000 --> 38:58.919
{\an8}MY MEATBALL. I ALREADY
LOST HER WITH THE DRINKING,

38:59.003 --> 39:00.421
{\an8}AND NOW
I'M LOSING HER IN MY ROOM?

39:00.504 --> 39:03.007
{\an8}LIKE, I UNDERSTAND
IT'S GOOD FOR HER,

39:03.090 --> 39:05.926
{\an8}BUT THIS BLOWS FOR ME.

39:08.137 --> 39:11.348
{\an8}- THAT'S ALL.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.059
{\an8}- I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
- YEAH.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.226
{\an8}- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.644
{\an8}JUST MAKE SURE
NO ONE TAKES MY BED

39:15.728 --> 39:18.439
{\an8}'CAUSE I MIGHT WANNA SLEEP HERE
ON STAY-AT-HOME NIGHTS.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.232
{\an8}- SNOOKI'S A DIFFERENT PERSON
NOW THAT SHE'S PREGNANT.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.776
{\an8}SHE IS GROWING UP

39:21.859 --> 39:23.944
{\an8}AND SHE IS FINALLY
ACCEPTING THE FACT

39:24.028 --> 39:25.446
{\an8}THAT THIS SHORE HOUSE
IS NOT A PLACE

39:25.529 --> 39:26.947
{\an8}FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN
TO SLEEP IN.

39:27.031 --> 39:27.698
{\an8}THERE'S FUCKING THINGS
BEING THROWN AROUND,

39:27.782 --> 39:29.825
{\an8}PEOPLE FIGHTING,

39:29.909 --> 39:30.951
{\an8}STRANGERS
COMING IN AND OUT,

39:31.035 --> 39:33.287
{\an8}AND SO WE DEFINITELY
SUPPORT HER DECISION,

39:33.370 --> 39:35.081
{\an8}BUT WE'RE GONNA MISS
HAVING A ROOMMATE

39:35.164 --> 39:36.123
{\an8}NOT SLEEPING HOME
ALL THE TIME.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.125
{\an8}- WHAT ELSE
CAN WE TALK ABOUT?

39:38.209 --> 39:39.835
{\an8}- LET'S HAVE A RAP BATTLE.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.545
{\an8}- WHY DON'T WE ALL RAP BATTLE
LIKE WE USED TO DO?

39:41.629 --> 39:42.630
{\an8}- NO.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.215
{\an8}- YO, I GOT
MAD SHIT TO DO.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.342
{\an8}EVERYBODY STAND IN A CIRCLE.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.135

{\an8}AND, LIKE, PHWING!
LIKE THAT.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.475
{\an8}- WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO DARTS?

39:54.558 --> 39:55.893
{\an8}- WE'RE STAYING IN TONIGHT

39:55.976 --> 39:57.478
{\an8}SO I WANNA PLAY
SOME GAMES IN THE HOUSE

39:57.561 --> 39:59.230
{\an8}AND JUST MAKING
A GOOD TIME OUT OF IT.
