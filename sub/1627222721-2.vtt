WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.004
<i>This was supposed to be
a joyous occasion.</i>

00:04.087 --> 00:05.213
Okay, we're back.

00:05.296 --> 00:07.924
<i>Mr. Benedict
and Number Two are missing.</i>

00:08.008 --> 00:10.802
<i>No one is safe with my brother
as some guru.</i>

00:10.885 --> 00:13.555
I know that you'll be elated.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.974
<i>He made us a set of clues
to lead us to where he is.</i>

00:16.057 --> 00:19.894
-"Take the shortcut."
-It's a ship.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.188
It's very rare
to have tickets left for pickup.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.482
<i>They told us we're capable
of doing anything.</i>

00:24.566 --> 00:26.651
<i>We had to take matters
into our own hands.</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:27.861
<i>We'll be careful.</i>

00:27.944 --> 00:29.946
REYNIE:
<i>We're the Mysterious Benedict Society,</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.322
<i>so let's go after them.</i>

00:50.258 --> 00:52.510
Eighty-one thousand,
nine hundred sixty tons

00:52.594 --> 00:54.512
of steel and elegance.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.308
How much does elegance weigh, George?
What percentage of tonnage?

00:59.392 --> 01:01.603
Our first chance
to be on a flagship vessel

01:01.686 --> 01:03.980
and we'll probably be enjoying it
from the brig.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.648
Boat jail. Let's avoid.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.359
Yeah. We need to lie low, blend in.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.611
We're stowaways.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.155
There's nothing more despise
than stowaways.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.615
Come on. Ever heard of pirates?

01:13.698 --> 01:15.075
Pirates are just doing their job.

01:16.284 --> 01:19.537
The best way to avoid boat jail
is not to stand on the deck,

01:19.621 --> 01:21.539
talking about the morality of pirates.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.124
We need to find the next clue.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.959
It'll tell us where to go
when we get to Lisbon.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.753
We need to find our room.

01:26.836 --> 01:30.006
Mr. Benedict thought we'd be in that
stateroom with Rhonda and Milligan,

01:30.090 --> 01:31.549
so the clue has to be there.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.886
And the room will be vacant, right?
Because it was reserved.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.848
CAPTAIN NOLAND:
<i>Good day and welcome aboard.</i>

01:38.973 --> 01:40.642
<i>This is Captain Noland.</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:43.186
<i>Please report to your
designated evacuation areas</i>

01:43.269 --> 01:45.146
<i>for our mandatory muster drill.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:48.650
<i>Fear is best bested when bested as one.</i>

01:48.733 --> 01:51.653
No way. I don't like drills.
Let's just go for the clue.

01:51.736 --> 01:55.782
Agree. In emergency,
women and children first.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.909
Question, advantage? We'll be fine.

01:57.992 --> 02:01.830
Captain said it's mandatory.
We want to be the only ones not there?

02:01.913 --> 02:06.334
Also, do you have any idea
how quickly 81,960 ton sinks?

02:06.417 --> 02:08.086
Elegance doesn't float either.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.339
CAPTAIN NOLAND:
<i>We nonetheless stand ready to face them.</i>

02:11.422 --> 02:14.342
Beware, rogue waves are very real.

02:14.425 --> 02:19.639
White squalls are fast-acting
and unpredictable foe, mines.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.225
Well, there are no current belligerence.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.436
<i>These relics of man's folly
still bout the seas,</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:28.481
<i>ready to sting us from a darker past.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:30.608
<i>Piracy is, of course,
still a great scourge.</i>

02:30.692 --> 02:33.194
<i>You may consider yourself
perfectly safe for mutiny</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:35.405
<i>on this harmonious craft.</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:37.157
That's sad.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.659
I've always wanted
to live through a mutiny.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.370
There are a lot of pirates
in these parts or mines?

02:42.453 --> 02:43.746
Excuse me, sir.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.668
I'm Executive Officer Zhao
but my <i>nom d'océan</i> is Cannonball.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.003
Cool nickname. How did you get it?

02:50.086 --> 02:53.047
I have neither the time nor inclination
to relay that anecdote.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.091
Because I think nicknames
can be an important part of a...

02:55.592 --> 02:56.885
My charge is your safety.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.386
Please be prepared to move along.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.057
-This guy is gonna be an issue.
-Yeah.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.393
We need to get out of his sight
and into that stateroom.

03:05.977 --> 03:06.978
Which is where?

03:07.061 --> 03:10.857
First, we have to figure out a profile.
Who we're meant to be, if questioned.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.819
-Child ghosts.
-Maybe a school group.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.572
Wish we had matching tracksuits
like the cricket squad over there.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.073
Must be headed to the Dunsborough Cup.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.576
Their warm-ups,
say "water polo", actually.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.453
Oh, yeah. Big-time crew.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.664
-Continue.
-How do we find the clue?

03:26.748 --> 03:29.751
The ticket agent was handing out
room keys from the wall behind her.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.837
One of those keys still hanging
was supposed to be ours.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.672
I couldn't make out their numbers,

03:34.756 --> 03:39.052
but if each row was a deck
and each row have 39 hooks,

03:39.594 --> 03:42.180
these are the room numbers
for staterooms still unassigned

03:42.263 --> 03:43.389
at the time we tried to check in.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.685
Just 16 rooms, not bad.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.062
CAPTAIN NOLAND:
<i>Thank you for your attention.</i>

03:49.145 --> 03:53.858
<i>That completes the muster
as we travel at a steady 62 knots.</i>

03:55.151 --> 03:58.821
Split up and move it. I'm hungry.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.573
CAPTAIN NOLAND:
<i>Shortcut's both the fastest</i>

04:00.657 --> 04:03.284
<i>and most luxurious ship on the seven seas.</i>

04:03.368 --> 04:04.661
<i>Precisely on time.</i>

04:04.869 --> 04:08.581
<i>And prepare to dock in Lisbon
in a spectacular 48 hours.</i>

04:09.165 --> 04:11.459
This has been the captain. Good day.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.134
Permission to speak freely.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.553
Always, Cannonball.
You and I are beyond formality.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.765
No, thank you, Captain.
I strongly request formality.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.183
Granted. What's on your mind?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.685
Based on my life jacket count,

04:28.768 --> 04:31.312
there are four extra passengers
onboard the Shortcut.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.898
What are you saying? That we have...

04:33.982 --> 04:35.149
Stowaways.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.443
Stowaways.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.446
The cardinal maritime sin on my ship.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.532
Is there any chance of a miscalculation?

04:42.615 --> 04:44.617
Permission to speak frankly
and without hesitation.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.661
Oh, I know there's no miscalculation.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.039
You are the human embodiment
of accuracy and integrity.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.249
That's correct.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.668
Thank you, Captain.

04:53.751 --> 04:57.964
My job is already in jeopardy.
I feel the walls closing in on me.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.926
If this is discovered,
your career might survive, but not mine.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.305
We need to find those stowaways.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.056
I need to see them walking the plank.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.393
Captain, that is no longer legal.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.686
Nor was it ever ethical.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.396
Metaphorically.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.398
No rest until they're in custody.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.027
Make an example of them.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.254
Elated?

06:20.338 --> 06:22.799
Yes, you heard me correctly.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.843
You think I'll be elated
to hear you continue to claim

06:25.927 --> 06:27.595
you ended The Emergency?

06:27.678 --> 06:31.307
A global crisis you are wholly
responsible for creating?

06:31.391 --> 06:35.103
Drop this ridiculous facade
and offer the truth now.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.146
-No, it's not a facade.
-Oh.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.901
I believe the instigator
of a moment of change

06:41.984 --> 06:44.153
can come from an unexpected direction.

06:44.821 --> 06:48.324
You see, by instigating The Emergency...

06:52.286 --> 06:53.454
I also...

06:55.706 --> 06:57.458
solved it.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.088
What are you talking about?

07:02.588 --> 07:06.592
You're delusional
and your demonstration is meaningless.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.428
To the point of obfuscation.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.054
I rather liked it.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.889
Well, what does the blueberry represent?

07:11.973 --> 07:15.726
Yes. What does it represent? This is...

07:15.810 --> 07:17.687
I need a moment. Just a moment.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.896
-I'm just overwhelmed.
-Are you okay?

07:18.980 --> 07:20.106
-I'm fine.
-Just breathe.

07:24.193 --> 07:27.071
You are no hero, sir.

07:27.572 --> 07:32.702
And you are no mere associate.
You're the fabled Number Two.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.620
I am, yes.

07:34.704 --> 07:38.207
Brilliant thinker, intuitive woodworker.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.627
This changes nothing.
Given that you've kidnapped us.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.838
Kidnapped? No.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.341
A word like that
just fuels the cycle of anger.

07:47.425 --> 07:51.929
Oh, it's so potent.
It just erases all subtlety and nuance.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.850
Well, there is nothing particularly
nuanced about this situation.

07:56.434 --> 08:00.563
Think of it as an opportunity.
Please, sit down. Have some tea.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.399
I don't want your tea.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.901
I understand.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.865
Would you please show
our special guests to their rooms,

08:10.948 --> 08:12.366
so they can get settled in?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.411
Your brother.
This is a special honor. Indeed.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.247
-Thank you for your trust.
-Oh, we don't trust you.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.291
-We'll earn it.
-Every day in every way.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.043
-Right this way.
-Right this way.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.468
I want you to get out of here,
not go into the heart of it.

08:30.551 --> 08:34.555
No, no, no. We need the full picture,
and then we escape.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.149
Wait. I have a bad feeling.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.401
Regular bad or psychic bad?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.487
Just a feeling.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.953
Is the part of you
that knew someone was in there,

08:57.036 --> 08:58.454
the same part that took down
The Whisperer?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.415
Same part of me that wonders,
"Why pick a lock when you can just knock?"

09:07.296 --> 09:09.382
-What?
-Sorry, ma'am.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.301
-Wrong room.
-Sorry we disturbed you.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.641
It'll be kind of fun
to share a room again, right?

09:18.724 --> 09:22.645
Yeah. I'm not used to it anymore.
We all have singles at Boatwright.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.938
No roommates?

09:24.021 --> 09:26.023
Boatwright's all about personal space.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.068
-You know, healthy distance.
-Distance is healthy?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.195
You choose when to connect.

09:33.823 --> 09:38.494
So this ability you may or may not have,

09:38.995 --> 09:42.081
did you get it
from your biological parents?

09:45.376 --> 09:47.461
What happened to them?

09:47.962 --> 09:51.966
They were eaten by polar bears and clowns.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.344
-The sound was awful.
-You make it hard to try.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.681
Bonding is needy. What's with the rope?

09:59.265 --> 10:02.310
Speed check.
I don't just believe everything I'm told.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.104
Spent last year learning that.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.649
-Ha!
-"Ha", what?

10:09.817 --> 10:13.988
We're only moving at 58 knots,
not 62 like Captain Noland said.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.531
Stop right now!

10:18.200 --> 10:21.162
Playing over this side of the ship
is highly dangerous.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.040
We weren't playing. Speed check.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.708
Fifty-eight knots, if you're wondering.

10:25.791 --> 10:29.629
On the Shortcut,
all minors must be supervised by an adult.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.172
Where are your parents?

10:32.423 --> 10:34.634
-We're lost.
-Lost children?

10:34.717 --> 10:36.052
Children.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.974
Two lost children on the foredeck.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.478
<i>I repeat,
two lost children on the foredeck.</i>

10:46.187 --> 10:47.813
Roberta, there's Mom and Dad.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.912
-Welcome to the Inverness.
-This is good.

11:02.995 --> 11:07.041
We're scheduled to arrive in Lisbon
a good 25 hours before the kids.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.167
Good.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.547
I checked the rest of it.

11:18.969 --> 11:22.014
-Should I have brought more?
-It's not you.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.809
It's him.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.404
-Remarkable.
-Exhilarating.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.447
-It's peculiar.
-Unnerving.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.826
Shall we continue?

11:41.909 --> 11:43.661
Or do you need a moment to process?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.497
Oh, I would love to see where people
come and go as they please,

11:46.580 --> 11:47.748
AKA the exit.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.458
-Every exit is an entrance
-Every exit is an entrance

11:49.542 --> 11:50.960
-if you think about it.
-if you think about it.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.963
-I treasure you.
-And I you.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.469
And of course,
we are a working lemon grove.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.721
Meyer lemons.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.014
-Tart.
-But not too tart.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.768
Hello.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.562
Right this way.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.655
Look, they're giving color
to their emotions.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.115
So they're all feeling...

12:21.198 --> 12:22.241
-Happy.
-Happy.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.493
Who made you?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.120
I'd like to think we make each other.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.621
Who are these people?

12:27.705 --> 12:30.875
Some are executives from the Institute.
Only the best.

12:30.958 --> 12:35.713
Those most open to life and profundity,
others are devotees from around the world,

12:35.796 --> 12:37.590
hand-picked by Dr. Curtain.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.895
Our community
has been thoughtfully curated.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.897
Positivity is an absolute requirement.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.649
-Hello, friends.
-Hello, Sebastian.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.735
Sebastian is from Brazil.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.195
-Brazil.
-Brazil.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.989
He's one of the earliest adopters
of Dr. Curtain's philosophy.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.326
It's all true. Brazil. Adoption.
All of it.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.745
-Isn't it great?
-Yes.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.083
-What's happening here?
-How is he inducing...

13:13.167 --> 13:16.128
-His happiness.
-Is it an untraceable supplement?

13:16.212 --> 13:20.883
Unclear, but it is remarkable
and most likely dangerous.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.360
Welcome. Consider this yours.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.238
Feel free to avail yourself
of all the opportunities here.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.907
Or wait for an opportunity
to present itself.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.201
Are you talking about the bathroom?

13:47.284 --> 13:48.702
That's up to you.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.170
Well, we can't stay here.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
We have to get word
to Rhonda and Milligan.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.549
And the children.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.634
No doubt their worry
will soon lead to action.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.261
I've seen enough.

14:06.262 --> 14:10.641
Let's take the opportunity... to escape.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.992
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
twenty-nine, thirty.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.118
I think he's got it.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.496
Based on the distance between these doors,

14:32.580 --> 14:35.541
this stateroom is larger
than any others we've been to.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.336
That would make sense since
we were all going to be staying together.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.306
Wow, sweet room.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.395
Okay. We should really look for the clue.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.608
-I'll look in the fruit basket.
-I'll check the bedroom.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.651
Wow, a map of Oceania.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.364
Guys, the clue. Anything?

15:07.948 --> 15:10.576
-One of the books is inverted.
-What?

15:30.346 --> 15:33.349
It pushes air, wow.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.683
That can't be it.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.946
The clue is up here. Turn off the fan.

15:51.408 --> 15:56.246
Oh, I'm sorry. I think this is our room.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.418
This is very uncomfortable.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.588
They said the guests who booked
this suite never boarded.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.591
We're on our honeymoon,
so they upgraded us.

16:07.967 --> 16:12.179
Tom, why don't you quickly go talk
to that nice man, Cannonball?

16:12.262 --> 16:15.891
-He'll clear this up.
-No. You stay. We'll go.

16:16.392 --> 16:20.104
-Great. We're very tired.
-Wait.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.773
Are you sure you want a room
with the ceiling fan?

16:22.856 --> 16:24.191
A lot of people don't like those.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.944
Everybody likes ceiling fans.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.204
Well, if you can't make dessert,
serve them a cheese plate.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.747
That's considered very classy.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.624
Yes.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.130
This ship is known
for its tower of pastries,

16:46.213 --> 16:47.965
for its freshly cured gravlax.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.803
-How can we have no sugar?
-It's an unforgivable oversight.

16:52.886 --> 16:56.598
I assume you're here about the stowaways,
but you haven't found them.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.183
I'm sorry, Captain.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.395
I hear their laughter, Cannonball.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.815
I hear those hyenas and their jokes.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.902
You rupture just one supertanker
and it follows you forever.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.614
Nobody mentions that the channel map
was out of date

17:12.698 --> 17:14.992
-with a hundred-year fog.
-Um...

17:15.075 --> 17:17.453
That sandbar was not supposed to be there.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.460
Good news.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.463
I did return two minors to their parents.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.048
Curious thing,

17:29.131 --> 17:32.009
one of them claimed that the ship's
not traveling at max speed.

17:32.092 --> 17:36.055
No, our speed is fine.
The sugar is the disaster.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.183
Add in the stowaways
and there's a perfect storm brewing.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.728
I cannot lose this post, Cannonball.
I'm deeply in debt.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.438
Regrettable, but...

17:44.521 --> 17:46.440
I was trying
to protect your feelings earlier.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.735
The XO is often unfairly scapegoated
in these scenarios.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.780
We both need them found.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.365
I will escalate this to Situation Alpha.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.201
And list all crew.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.164
REYNIE :
We shouldn't be out and about like this.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.540
We're too exposed.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.918
Like a baby gazelle undeveloped.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.169
Exactly like that.

18:07.252 --> 18:11.256
Guys, we handled Cannonball.
No one thinks we're the stowaways.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.926
-Enjoy the raw bar.
-Kate's right.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.678
We need to eat and that couple will too.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.890
When they come here, we sneak back
into the room and get the clue.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.601
Until then, blend in.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.604
This is vulgar and decadent.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.868
-Sticky.
-Hooves.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.162
BOTH :
<i>Amicitia vera illuminat!</i>

18:42.246 --> 18:44.164
Sticky 119, what's up?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.250
Guys, this is Marcus Hoover.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.001
We're in a few clubs together
at Boatwright.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.087
Hm! Clubs.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.464
-So, how are you doing, Hooves?
-Great.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.551
Just doing a quick tour
of Offshore Wind Farms with my mom's.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.845
-Who's this crew?
-Oh, right. Sorry.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.472
This is Kate, and Reynie, and Constance.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.684
We're on a scavenger hunt,
very science-based.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.353
Collecting mineral deposits,
assessing water table levels.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.439
That sounds awesome.
Right up your alley, 119.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.860
-Okay, what's with the 119?
-Sticky's so smart,

19:12.943 --> 19:15.237
they're gonna name
the next element after him.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.657
-There are currently 118 elements and...
-We got it.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.076
-This guy's a legend.
-No, you're a legend.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.829
Oh, come meet my folks.
They love talking geology.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.837
You feel too much. It will get us killed.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.635
You... process.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.889
I can't let this opportunity go to waste.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.353
Evening, Kate Weatherall.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.647
Played a bit of polo myself.
Loved the game.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.483
Hm. We enjoy the game, too.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.653
That is why we play it... for a living.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.697
Cool. So, who's the goalie here?

19:59.948 --> 20:01.074
Bauer.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.287
Yes. That is the position I play.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.873
I prevent goals
from being scored in our net.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.668
Now that we've answered
your question satisfactorily,

20:12.252 --> 20:15.631
We will get back to dinner... as a team.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.969
So, Bauer, should I use my lead hand
or my trail hand

20:21.053 --> 20:23.222
to get out of the water more
for high corners?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.558
Lead hand. Always and forever.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.064
This is... nice.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.025
Oh, my. Just one moment.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.070
-Oh, that's easy.
-You know, even like a small amount

20:38.153 --> 20:39.821
of beetroot powder
would increase blood flow

20:39.905 --> 20:42.741
-to your muscles and maximize the...
-Please, stop harping on my fitness.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.159
If not now, when?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.286
I'm sorry.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.080
Just tell me we gotta get out of here.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.540
Whatever your brother
brought us here for, it's not good.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.293
I know. I just wish I knew how.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.337
How is he making people this happy?

20:55.420 --> 21:00.050
-Endorphin boosters, implanted microchips?
-Nothing is beyond him. Nothing.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.136
He's always been obsessed
with being liked. Obsessed.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.597
I mean, perhaps he's mastered
the art of persuasion.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.350
Or simply, it's his charisma
that got him here, but I don't think so.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.310
I think it's something more... Hello.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.105
-Hey, guys.
-Sebastian, yes?

21:13.188 --> 21:14.731
-Indeed.
-Yes.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.360
-Wow, you look so much like your brother.
-Oh.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.737
-And almost as sweet.
-Well...

21:20.821 --> 21:22.155
You must be so proud of him.

21:22.239 --> 21:26.201
I'll tell you before I met Dr. Curtain,
I was living in São Paolo.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.536
I was on the beach.

21:27.619 --> 21:32.582
I had a great job, friends, money.
And yet, I was so deeply unhappy.

21:32.666 --> 21:36.962
I couldn't figure it out.
Then I read the book.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.214
-Watched the video.
-Oh, my.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.259
And now, I'm here. It's a miracle.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.594
Are you all right?

21:44.678 --> 21:47.222
Nothing some sunlight
and smiles cannot fix.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.101
-Or sports massage?
-Love your humor.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.021
Come, walk with me. It's so beautiful out.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.440
-Oh, we're on our own hike. I'm sorry.
-Yes.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.986
Understood. I'm absolutely thrilled
our paths have crossed here.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.904
-<i>Hasta luego.
-Hasta luego.</i>

22:08.535 --> 22:11.413
The brochure touted
your house-made pastries,

22:11.496 --> 22:13.874
the jams, a compote bar.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.835
-Was it all a lie?
-I apologize.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.964
Global supply shortages
always impact the cruise industry first

22:21.048 --> 22:22.674
and in this case...

22:26.511 --> 22:28.013
It's really fascinating

22:28.138 --> 22:31.224
because I'd always assumed
the trail hand gave more lift.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.726
Total game changer.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.227
Good evening, girls.

22:34.394 --> 22:37.939
Good to see you again
in a less fraught situation,

22:38.023 --> 22:39.316
back together with your...

22:39.399 --> 22:40.400
-They're our brothers.
-We're their cousins.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.863
We're a blended family.
We don't love labels.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.198
Huh.

22:46.782 --> 22:50.327
What wonderful parents you must have.
And where are they?

22:50.410 --> 22:52.079
They ate some bad prawns.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.498
He's got a smokey pyramid.
It's very adorable.

22:54.581 --> 22:58.043
Bad prawns? How awful.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.295
-Hello, good evening.
-Hi.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.301
Yes. They were in distress.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.595
We should actually go check on them.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.310
Hi, good evening.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.437
Let's hurry up.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.564
That couple could be here any minute.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.274
I'd say we have at least 45 minutes.

23:25.821 --> 23:26.988
Shortcut bucks.

23:33.036 --> 23:34.371
Thirty-seven mean anything to you?

23:35.288 --> 23:37.999
Of course. It's my favorite number.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.961
You know, other people on the ship
actually respect me.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.589
Guys, Mr. Benedict made this
specifically to be solved together.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.925
We won't be able to solve it
if we're fighting.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.552
We should respect human death.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.560
"Look up to the stars.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.063
Take wing to the sun."
Signed, "Mr. Benedict."

24:00.772 --> 24:02.774
All of the chips have a star on one side.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.985
And they each have two numbers.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.072
Look up to the stars.

24:09.489 --> 24:12.325
Look up to the stars. Look up...

24:13.160 --> 24:14.411
It's a grid.

24:14.494 --> 24:18.707
If we use the south wall
and the west wall as our X and Y axis,

24:18.790 --> 24:21.835
we can plot our points
using the number pairs on the chips.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.421
Like plotting a course on a map.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.382
More like pre-algebra graphing, but sure.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.137
What's the first coordinate?

24:32.220 --> 24:33.680
Five, ten.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.025
There. What's the next one?

24:49.070 --> 24:52.407
So much of the time it's just fun.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.619
And then we're arguing.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.954
Arguing about plunge routers,

24:58.038 --> 25:01.958
or fixed base routers, taxonomy,
or orange juice.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.418
I'm so confused.

25:03.502 --> 25:07.130
It makes me think,
did Kate escape to find Benedict

25:07.214 --> 25:11.176
or was part of her trying
to escape from me?

25:12.010 --> 25:14.638
<i>Just a bit of light chop
for the next few minutes.</i>

25:14.721 --> 25:17.140
<i>Make sure those seat belts are fastened.</i>

25:20.769 --> 25:25.607
I just thought that once we were reunited,
it would all be simple again.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.485
-Well, it's not.
-It's hard.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.612
It's hard.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.802
Oh, big fence.

25:58.682 --> 26:03.019
Your faith in me is inspiring, Number Two,
but I'm not an accomplished climber.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.773
Just do what I do.
Pretend you're an angry howler monkey

26:06.856 --> 26:10.026
and at the top of the fence
is the person who stole your jackfruit.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.488
Both motivation, helpful.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.123
The numbers are robust, sir.

26:23.206 --> 26:25.792
We're blamed for target after target.
It's all happening.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.752
Should I call S.Q. out for the next stage?

26:27.836 --> 26:30.922
No, S.Q.'s on a walkabout.
It's a journey of self-discovery.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.132
We have to respect that.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.801
All is good. We're on track.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.137
-Electric fence?

26:38.722 --> 26:40.390
You can leave us, Marlon.

26:41.808 --> 26:42.976
Excellent.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.437
An electric fence.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.856
Oh, whatever happened to free will?

26:47.939 --> 26:51.067
"Choose happiness. Choose your own path."

26:51.151 --> 26:54.237
It's a defensive fence.
We're protecting the vibe.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.657
The vibe.
Everything about this place is a lie.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.535
I've tried to reach you.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.039
I've tried to acknowledge my part
in your pain,

27:04.122 --> 27:08.501
-but all you can do is...
-Nicholas, I've moved on.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.802
Listen to me.

27:18.845 --> 27:23.933
You are holding on
to an outdated view of me.

27:24.476 --> 27:28.521
That is the source of much unhappiness.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.816
This sadness is a choice.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.861
You're changing your cadence
and your frequency.

27:34.944 --> 27:38.531
Sadness is so isolating.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.036
Why not manifest something more healing?

27:43.119 --> 27:47.290
Orchestrated movements.
Sequencing my rods and my cones.

27:47.374 --> 27:52.962
Make a choice. Choose happiness.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.464
No, I see what you're doing.

27:54.547 --> 27:59.844
You're using neurobehavioral techniques
to trigger chemical releases in the brain,

28:00.387 --> 28:02.514
creating an elevation of mood.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.893
It's brilliant, isn't it?

28:07.852 --> 28:10.772
Brilliant? It's deplorable.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.775
You're creating
an artificial state of happiness.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.777
People seem to enjoy it.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.906
It is a complete disconnection
from true emotion.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.784
Who's actually gonna benefit
from all that except you?

28:24.285 --> 28:27.247
It's so disappointing
to see you turn to envy.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.874
I'm not jealous.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.753
I'm heartbroken.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.672
You don't have to be.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.049
You can be happy.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.305
Goat yogurt and berries
for breakfast tomorrow.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.642
You'll be teeming with flavonoids.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.812
Perhaps that will open you up
to new ideas.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.805
Now, what?

29:25.889 --> 29:27.724
Which one is the sun we fly to?

29:32.937 --> 29:34.397
We're running out of time.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.319
Zinc sulfide.

29:39.402 --> 29:42.197
You're not the only scientist, George.

29:45.867 --> 29:51.372
Cannonball, what do you know
about home equity lines of credit?

29:52.665 --> 29:56.044
Nothing, sir,
but I've identified the stowaways.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.671
Finally, something to celebrate.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.965
Are they rotting in the brig?

30:01.049 --> 30:05.053
I don't have them in custody yet,
but the hunt is on.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.641
It's a constellation.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.393
Sure, but which one?

30:16.481 --> 30:21.110
"Take wing to the sun."
Is it a bird, a sunbird?

30:21.486 --> 30:24.405
No. It's Apollo's bird.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.368
Apollo was the god of the sun,
and his bird was Corvus.

30:28.451 --> 30:30.286
That's the constellation for Corvus.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.372
That's supposed to be a bird?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.250
The Greeks were terrible artists.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.757
Why would he show us Apollo's bird?
We're looking for a location.

30:43.049 --> 30:48.137
Because the train station in Lisbon
is the Santa Apolonia,

30:48.638 --> 30:51.099
which translates to Saint Apollo.

30:52.392 --> 30:56.813
I'm a ferroequinologist. A railfan.
There's a lot of us.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.691
I bet we use that key
at the train station.

30:59.774 --> 31:00.900
Great job, guys.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.612
And you can make fun of me,
but we did this together.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.197
No one's gonna make fun of you.
