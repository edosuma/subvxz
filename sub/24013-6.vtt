00:49.257 --> 00:51.801
Morning, fun fans, and welcome

00:51.885 --> 00:55.430
to the annual Party Games!

01:03.688 --> 01:05.774
Yay!

01:11.404 --> 01:14.157
-Yay!
-Oh.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.535
- Here you go!
- Ooh!

01:17.619 --> 01:19.704
I'm your host, Queen Poppy,

01:19.788 --> 01:23.166
joined by Party Games first-timer Branch!

01:26.002 --> 01:29.214
Thanks for having me, Poppy.
I'm excited to see who wins.

01:29.297 --> 01:33.301
Nobody wins, Branch.
The Games are about having a good time.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.595
So, instead of keeping score,

01:35.678 --> 01:39.182
we track how much fun the teams spread
on the fun meter!

01:39.265 --> 01:41.351
Hey-o!

01:41.434 --> 01:44.312
The tournament doesn't end
till the meter hits its peak,

01:44.395 --> 01:46.523
'cause that's when...

01:46.606 --> 01:48.108
...everybody wins!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
You're gonna be doing those sounds
all day, aren't you?

01:50.401 --> 01:53.196
Ding, ding, ding! That's right!

01:53.279 --> 01:58.034
Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!
Look who's coming into the arena!

01:58.118 --> 02:02.831
It's the Champion of Fun himself,
Guy Diamond!

02:12.048 --> 02:14.634
- Hyah!
- Blammo!

02:14.717 --> 02:18.721
Diamond! Diamond!
Diamond! Diamond!

02:22.100 --> 02:23.393
Look out, Trolls!

02:23.476 --> 02:26.229
Someone just dropped a joy bomb
on the court.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.064
Better call 9-1-fun!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.065
Oh, yeah!

02:29.149 --> 02:32.569
Champion of Fun in the hizzy!

02:32.652 --> 02:34.737
All right, way to give 'em fun
out there, champ.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.905
Stay loose.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.576
Thanks, Smidge. Got to refuel.
Hit me with those Party Game nutrients.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.536
On it. Seven-layer dip.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.080
Punch?

02:45.665 --> 02:48.167
Ooh! I feel great, Smidge.

02:48.251 --> 02:52.046
It's been my lifelong dream
to lead the Games to a full meter

02:52.130 --> 02:55.174
and go down as
the most fun Troll in history.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.261
And today that dream comes true.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.013
It sure will, Guy!

03:05.935 --> 03:08.730
Uh... thanks, pal.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.733
Whenever I need a compliment,
I can always count on...

03:11.816 --> 03:13.693
Actually, I-I don't know who you are.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.029
Archer Pastry. Huge fan.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.947
Huge fan!

03:18.031 --> 03:19.365
Archer's joining our team.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.742
He's subbing in for Harper

03:20.825 --> 03:23.912
while she recovers
from the "croquet accident."

03:26.205 --> 03:28.333
Nice reflexes! High five!

03:30.460 --> 03:33.630
Should've never used old righty.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.548
And, hey, full disclosure--

03:35.632 --> 03:40.011
I'm just a rookie, but I'll sure do
my best to not let you down.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.263
That's the spirit. You go, Troll.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.434
No, seriously, go. It's your turn.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.645
Oh! Don't want to be that Troll.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.564
Archer Pastry, eh?

03:51.648 --> 03:54.651
Can't believe I've never met him before.
He's so nice.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.611
Miss you guys!

03:56.694 --> 04:00.657
Yeah. A little too nice.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.783
Which I can live with.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.035
Just wish he had
more Party Game experience.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.495
Ah, don't sweat that.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.665
Not when the Champion of Fun's around
to make up the difference.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.832
Uh? Uh? Uh?

04:09.916 --> 04:12.210
-Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
-Uh? Uh? Uh? Uh? Uh?

04:12.293 --> 04:17.048
And now back to the silver team,
with Archer Pastry!

04:18.757 --> 04:20.927
Huh?

04:26.557 --> 04:28.184
Sound the alarm, folks!

04:29.936 --> 04:31.104
Oh, dear.

04:31.187 --> 04:35.858
Newcomer Archer Pastry just made
the most fun move I have ever seen!

04:41.406 --> 04:44.325
Guy? Guy?

04:44.409 --> 04:48.121
Uh-oh. That's the "I feel threatened
by a young upstart" stare.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.330
I know it well.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.874
Wha--Who, me? No.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
Good, 'cause you're still
the most fun Troll of all time.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.296
That was just beginner's luck.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.089
Yeah. Beginner's luck.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.507
Which is great for him,

04:59.590 --> 05:02.010
even though it most certainly
won't happen again.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.761
The timed puzzle event
is under way,

05:03.845 --> 05:07.348
and Guy Diamond is sizzling!

05:07.432 --> 05:08.683
I got the top edge!

05:08.766 --> 05:11.311
And I've got the rest!

05:17.108 --> 05:20.194
And now the ever-popular
Guess and Draw.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.865
-It's a pod!
-Yeah!

05:26.409 --> 05:30.204
A purfle tree blowing in the wind
at sunset?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.122
Ah!

05:31.205 --> 05:34.125
Archer! Archer! Archer! Archer!

05:38.212 --> 05:40.882
He's--he's so fun.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.843
Yeah, a little too fun!

05:44.677 --> 05:47.513
But what are you gonna do?
He's still our teammate.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.641
But what if he wasn't our teammate?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.728
Spirits are soaring

05:53.811 --> 05:56.230
as the silver team attempts
the next event--

05:56.314 --> 05:58.775
javelin the tail on the Cooper.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.401
Huh?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.820
Oops, sorry! I'll move.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.366
What a throw!

06:09.994 --> 06:14.040
Wait, wait, before you go, Archer,
guess who I ran into.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.374
Harper!

06:18.086 --> 06:21.089
Hey, team! You can't tell, but I'm waving.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.592
She says she feels good enough to play!

06:24.675 --> 06:26.803
-I did?
-Isn't that great news?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.889
It's a Party Game miracle!

06:29.972 --> 06:30.807
Sure is!

06:30.890 --> 06:32.350
Aw, but you know what, though?

06:32.433 --> 06:35.228
The person who was replacing her
has to step down.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.188
Oh, who was that, again?

06:37.271 --> 06:38.439
It was me, Guy!

06:38.523 --> 06:40.608
Archer? Not you!

06:40.691 --> 06:43.027
Rats! This is so disappointing!

06:43.111 --> 06:45.863
I'm gonna raise such a stink about it!

06:45.947 --> 06:49.325
Anger sounds!

06:49.408 --> 06:51.285
No, no, don't.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.122
I'm just glad Harper's all better.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.373
Go have fun, team!

06:55.456 --> 06:57.250
Oh, we will!

06:57.333 --> 06:59.669
Now, Harper's turn.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.632
In a shocking turn of events,
Harper's back to play for the silver team.

07:07.552 --> 07:11.389
Guy, I-I'm starting to think
Harper's actually not ready.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.682
What makes you say that?

07:19.981 --> 07:22.859
She's just got to warm up.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.861
Or, you know, let all her bones set.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.992
- Yeah!
- Clackety, clackety, clackety!

07:31.075 --> 07:33.453
A tremendous throw by Guy Diamond!

07:33.536 --> 07:35.663
Zip, zap, zow!

07:35.746 --> 07:36.914
That was terrible.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.500
Yay!

07:39.584 --> 07:43.129
See? The Champion of Fun is back!

07:45.173 --> 07:47.800
And an even better throw
by Archer...

07:48.843 --> 07:51.429
...who now plays for the red team!

07:51.512 --> 07:54.807
Archer? B-but how is he still
in the Games?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.058
Hey, Guy!

07:56.142 --> 07:57.477
Isn't it crazy?

07:57.560 --> 08:01.022
Turns out the red team also had a player
that got injured!

08:01.105 --> 08:01.939
Hmm?

08:03.191 --> 08:06.277
-Yeah!
-Nice bobbing! High five!

08:08.779 --> 08:11.282
Should've never used old lefty.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.910
Anyway, they asked me to join.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.288
Isn't that a hoot?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.999
See you at the relay!

08:20.082 --> 08:24.045
With the meter ready to peak,
this might just be the last event!

08:24.128 --> 08:28.299
The eggy-spoony relay!

08:28.382 --> 08:30.218
Funners, on your marks.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.385
Spoons set!

08:32.511 --> 08:34.347
Huge fan!

08:38.433 --> 08:40.269
Guy Diamond has an early lead!

08:40.352 --> 08:42.813
But watch out, here comes Archer!

08:42.897 --> 08:45.733
Here you go, Cooper! Teamwork forever!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.944
If you say so, red Guy Diamond!

08:48.027 --> 08:50.112
A perfect handoff from Archer!

08:50.196 --> 08:51.614
He's built up quite a lead.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.534
It would take a miracle for anyone
to catch him now.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.538
-Step aside, Harper, I got this!
-But it's a team relay!

08:59.539 --> 09:01.374
It's all you, Biggie!

09:01.457 --> 09:03.125
Smidge! If you want me
to keep going, say, "What?"

09:03.209 --> 09:04.794
-What?
-You got it!

09:04.877 --> 09:07.296
No... he... didn't!

09:09.966 --> 09:12.301
No!

09:17.473 --> 09:20.184
I did it! I did it!

09:20.268 --> 09:24.855
I'm the most fun Troll of all time!

09:26.649 --> 09:29.652
I... What?

09:30.695 --> 09:34.198
I don't understand. I was so fun.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.868
Foghorn.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.122
It looks like Guy forgot
the first rule of the Party Games.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.291
There's no I in "fun."

09:44.667 --> 09:47.712
Sorry, team. I really messed up.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.132
Oh, that's okay.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.884
Yeah! You can't tell,
but I'm giving you a thumbs-up.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.220
What do you say?
One last game of charades?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.638
Oh, yeah!

09:57.722 --> 09:59.724
-High five, team!
-Ah...

09:59.807 --> 10:01.225
Oh, right. Bad idea.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.810
Charades it is, then.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.605
But I won't be the one
acting out the clues.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.940
But you're the best at charades, champ.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.567
Eh, maybe.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.111
But am I the most fun?

10:12.194 --> 10:13.154
Huh?

10:13.237 --> 10:14.822
With the meter at a low,

10:14.905 --> 10:17.074
it's gonna take
a stellar charades performance

10:17.158 --> 10:20.411
to jump-start the fun,
and first up, we have...

10:22.121 --> 10:25.583
...Harper?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.508
Oh, my Guh.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.720
You guys are never gonna guess this.
I can barely move.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.847
No, no, no, you're doing great.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.683
It's clearly a puffalo
eating a birthday cake!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.602
-Mm? Mm?
-Wha--

10:44.685 --> 10:47.813
Oh, no, it's a puffalo giving birth
to a birthday cake!

10:47.897 --> 10:50.566
Not even close!

10:55.237 --> 10:57.657
It's a mushroom in a bad mood!

10:57.740 --> 11:00.034
Wait, it's a duck with a death wish.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.119
A funky chicken doing ballet!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.583
It's a carrot!

11:08.626 --> 11:11.003
A fun-loving ring-tailed lemur!

11:11.087 --> 11:13.881
A Norse teenager with progressive views
riding a dragon?

11:13.964 --> 11:18.010
Harper! Harper! Harper!
Harper! Harper!

11:18.094 --> 11:22.390
Harper! Harper! Harper!
Harper! Harper! Harper!

11:24.100 --> 11:26.102
And the fun meter is full!

11:26.185 --> 11:28.396
Games over!

11:28.479 --> 11:29.814
Boom!

11:29.897 --> 11:32.316
Pew! Pew! Pew!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.110
Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!

11:39.198 --> 11:40.449
-We did it, Guy!
-Whoo!

11:40.533 --> 11:42.118
-High five!
-Aah!

11:42.201 --> 11:43.786
Oh, my Guh.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.459
Yeah!

11:53.087 --> 11:55.923
Oh, yeah!
And there's more fun ahead, kids!

11:57.675 --> 12:02.430
It is my queenly pleasure to take you
on your first trip into...

12:03.514 --> 12:05.433
...the Troll Village Library!

12:06.767 --> 12:08.853
-Boring.
-Boring?

12:08.936 --> 12:11.105
Guys, every shelf in this library
is packed

12:11.188 --> 12:12.940
with adventure, excitement, and--

12:13.023 --> 12:14.942
Safety guides!

12:16.819 --> 12:20.948
Branch, I brought you along
to help sell the fun of the library.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.158
Hmm?

12:22.241 --> 12:26.454
Look, I know these scrapbooks
are a little old.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.540
Ooh.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.334
But they can really capture
your imagination

12:32.418 --> 12:34.795
in the hands of a great storyteller.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.798
Thank you, Poppy.
I am a great storyteller.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.176
The key is to make the story your own.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.804
I was talking about myself.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.557
Ooh!

12:46.640 --> 12:50.311
I told myself lots of stories
during my years in the bunker,

12:50.394 --> 12:52.897
and I was always on the edge of my seat.

12:52.980 --> 12:56.358
There's no way
you're a better storyteller than me.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.737
One story apiece.
We let the kids decide the winner.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.032
Story fight! Story fight! Story fight!

13:03.115 --> 13:05.117
Eccentric survivalists first.

13:05.951 --> 13:10.539
This is a cautionary tale
about the dangers of not playing it safe.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.208
Once upon a time,

13:12.291 --> 13:15.628
a pair of sassy twins
named Handbag and Satchel

13:15.711 --> 13:17.421
ventured deep into the forest,

13:17.505 --> 13:20.466
despite the warnings of a wise woodsman.

13:27.848 --> 13:32.019
Careful. The forest is dangerous,
and it's easy to get lost.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.439
Uh, first, the risk is worth it.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.025
We're going to a critter fashion show,

13:38.108 --> 13:42.154
where animals dress up like other animals!

13:46.158 --> 13:50.246
And second, to find our way back,
we're leaving a trail.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.748
Of snickerdoodles.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.083
Cookies? You can't!

13:54.166 --> 13:56.293
Those will attract predatory birds.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.711
You're not my dad!

13:57.795 --> 14:01.298
Yeah, and we're twins,
so you're also not my dad.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.677
But the deeper they wandered,

14:04.760 --> 14:07.263
the more confusing the forest became.

14:07.346 --> 14:11.058
They began to lose hope of ever seeing
a puffalo work it on the runway.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.643
And then they spotted...

14:12.726 --> 14:15.854
A house made of designer clothes!

14:22.194 --> 14:26.615
If you like those clothes,
you'll love what I have inside.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.703
Go inside the pod
of a suspicious, cackling stranger?

14:30.786 --> 14:32.329
Me first!

14:32.413 --> 14:34.415
Aah!

14:34.498 --> 14:39.044
Start sewing, because you're gonna make
my entire fall line!

14:41.589 --> 14:44.174
And so they sewed...

14:44.967 --> 14:46.594
...and sewed...

14:47.386 --> 14:48.387
...and sewed.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.098
That's the last one.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.643
Perfect. Now you can start
on my winter line!

15:02.359 --> 15:06.614
Realizing they were prisoners,
the twins came up with an escape plan.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.282
Hey, witch!

15:08.365 --> 15:11.035
We made our best outfit yet.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.870
Come in and try it on.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.872
How dumb do you think I am?

15:14.955 --> 15:18.709
But you're the only one dainty enough
to fit into this.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.215
Oh... well... when you put it that way...

15:29.803 --> 15:31.263
No, you tricked me!

15:31.347 --> 15:32.973
In a really obvious way!

15:33.057 --> 15:35.184
The fashion twins strike again!

15:35.267 --> 15:38.103
Stop calling us "the fashion twins."
That's not a thing.

15:38.187 --> 15:42.399
And so Handbag and Satchel
followed their trail home

15:42.483 --> 15:43.943
and lived happily ever after.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.153
- Yeah!
- Until they were attacked!

15:48.447 --> 15:51.617
So, you see, never leave
a trail of cookies

15:51.700 --> 15:54.370
that predatory birds can follow.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.497
The end!

16:01.377 --> 16:03.796
What's the matter? That story was amazing!

16:03.879 --> 16:06.340
It felt awfully lesson-y.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.051
Lesson-y and easy to top.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.597
This is the story of Rapunztroll,

16:13.681 --> 16:16.600
who was locked away in a tower.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.435
The ruler of a nearby village

16:18.519 --> 16:22.982
heard of Rapunztroll's plight
and set out on a rescue mission.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.527
Rapunztroll, Rapunztroll,
let down your hair,

16:26.610 --> 16:30.447
for I am here to free you from the witch
that's imprisoned you in this tower.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.207
I think you were misinformed.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.209
A witch didn't lock me up here.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.170
Oh. You isolated yourself by choice?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.213
Yeah.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.340
He locked himself up by choice.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.759
Ooh. Sorry I blamed you.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.429
Don't be.
Totally sounds like something I'd do.

16:53.512 --> 16:59.226
Anyway, if you'll excuse me,
I have, um, company.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.355
Start sewing!

17:03.939 --> 17:05.232
Wait, Rapunztroll!

17:05.315 --> 17:08.694
Don't you want to rejoin society?
You're all alone up there.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.030
Nope. Pretty happy in my fear tower.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.531
Besides, I'm not alone.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.700
I've got my best friend, Gareth.

17:14.782 --> 17:15.951
What's that, Gareth?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.578
You want to brush my hair?

17:17.661 --> 17:20.705
Uh-uh. It's my turn to brush your hair.

17:20.789 --> 17:24.209
Uh, I really think
you need to rejoin society.

17:24.292 --> 17:25.294
Come on down.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.046
You bet.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.050
You're not coming down, are you?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.762
Fine. I'll just climb up there
and bring you down!

17:39.808 --> 17:41.310
Aah! Oof!

17:42.644 --> 17:45.898
Did I forget to mention my fear tower
is heavily booby-trapped?

17:45.981 --> 17:47.524
What was I thinking?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.866
Aah!

17:55.949 --> 17:58.786
Did I also forget to mention
it has a lift?

17:58.869 --> 18:00.996
Where is my mind today?

18:02.623 --> 18:04.875
Oh! Dang. Forgot my helmet.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.046
Good for her for being safe.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.758
Better for me that she left
her catapult unattended.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.135
-Yoink!
-Tricked ya!

18:15.219 --> 18:17.554
Now I'll just easily climb my way
up your hair.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.889
Ow!

18:18.972 --> 18:21.141
Hey! Quit it! Ow!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.144
Ahh.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.063
See? Easy.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.439
Armor dance!

18:29.691 --> 18:31.819
I'm still never leaving this tower.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.030
Fine with me.
I'll just stay up here with you.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.699
We can talk about our feelings.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.869
Huh?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.413
Boom! Queen takes pawn.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.375
Welcome to the world, pal.
I think you're gonna like it out there.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.545
No, I don't like it!

18:49.628 --> 18:52.089
I love it!

18:53.215 --> 18:55.801
You were right as always, Queen.

18:55.884 --> 18:59.012
-And you've made my life...
-"And you've made my life so much better.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.348
I'd be lost without you."

19:01.431 --> 19:04.768
And so Rapunztroll realized
just how wrong he had been...

19:05.769 --> 19:10.566
...and how right the queen had been
and would always be forever.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.901
The end.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.530
Uh, that ending was totally unearned.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.656
Mm-hmm.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.909
-"Unearned"?
-You know, I couldn't agree more.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.828
At least it wasn't all lesson-y.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.664
Whoa, easy!

19:25.747 --> 19:28.333
Maybe you two should work out
whatever "this" is...

19:29.751 --> 19:33.714
...on your own time
and leave the real storytelling to me.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.799
Gather round, everyone.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.595
This is the story
of Jack and the Eyestalk.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.555
Times were tough.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.474
There weren't enough party supplies
to go around.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.893
-Forget it!
-Ah!

19:45.976 --> 19:48.395
The three of us can't fit
into one party hat.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.732
Jack, go into town and get more...
in exchange for your brother.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.901
Hats? That's what you think I'm worth?

19:53.984 --> 19:55.569
Ooh, you're right.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.695
One hat, then.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.198
Hmm.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.826
And so Jack went into town
to trade his brother in

20:02.910 --> 20:05.412
for one party hat and no more.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.331
Great news, Mom.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.626
I traded your oldest son for three beans.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.628
I said "hats," not beans!

20:12.711 --> 20:14.296
You got ripped off.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.308
What the huh?

20:26.391 --> 20:29.228
Three beans and only one eyestalk?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.104
I did get ripped off.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.233
Still, Jack thought
he might as well check it out.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.109
Might as well check it out!

20:43.742 --> 20:46.245
Whoa, a golden harp!

20:46.328 --> 20:49.373
Whoa, a golden goose!

20:49.456 --> 20:52.584
Whoa! That goose has swagger.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.671
And that's when Jack
came upon a giant,

20:55.754 --> 20:57.381
who was also a witch.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.972
Fee-fi-fo-fuddy!

21:05.055 --> 21:09.017
And just when it looked like
the giant was gonna eat all his guts...

21:09.101 --> 21:11.144
Will you be my new best buddy?

21:11.228 --> 21:14.356
Instead, they did
a best-friends montage!

21:22.531 --> 21:25.784
-Ready?
-Let's do this thing!

21:25.867 --> 21:29.913
Yeah!

21:32.040 --> 21:34.501
Today was so much fun,

21:34.584 --> 21:37.671
but I still feel bad
about trading my brother away.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.298
Well, we can fix that...

21:39.381 --> 21:41.717
with my time machine!

21:41.800 --> 21:44.428
No way!

21:48.181 --> 21:50.142
Got room for one more?

21:50.225 --> 21:52.894
- Heh.
- Ah!

21:52.978 --> 21:56.148
And they flew all around
in the time machine,

21:56.231 --> 21:59.943
solving mysteries
and running an artisanal bakery.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.904
But that's a tale for another time.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.950
So the moral of the story is,
time travel is real!

22:07.034 --> 22:09.036
Boomshakalaka!

22:09.119 --> 22:11.621
-Yeah!
-Yay!

22:11.705 --> 22:13.373
Story King! Story...

22:13.457 --> 22:15.751
But that lesson made no sense.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.462
And that ending was completely unearned.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.339
- Whoa, check this out!
- Look at this book!

22:20.422 --> 22:23.467
You know what? They're reading.
That's really all that matters.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.303
Little Red Riding Troll? Awesome!

22:26.386 --> 22:29.139
The Boy Who Cried Hugs? Sweet!

22:29.222 --> 22:31.975
Pride and Prejudice? Epic!

22:39.066 --> 22:41.276
Time travel is real!
