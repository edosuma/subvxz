00:21.492 --> 00:24.218
Did you get it? Linda, did you get it?

00:24.243 --> 00:26.661
- Ha, I got it!
- Yes!

00:26.686 --> 00:28.273
What are you, uh... what
are you guys talking about?

00:28.298 --> 00:30.540
The bake sale! The
Wagstaff School Bake Sale.

00:30.565 --> 00:32.563
- What am I talking about.
- Oh, right.

00:32.588 --> 00:34.594
You-you know about that?

00:34.619 --> 00:36.563
Yeah. Linda told me about it.

00:36.588 --> 00:39.708
She ran it three years ago,
and Colleen Caviello tanked it

00:39.743 --> 00:40.860
to make Linda look bad.

00:40.891 --> 00:43.145
Yeah. She went behind
my back and told everyone

00:43.180 --> 00:44.646
to bring banana bread.

00:44.681 --> 00:46.813
- So we had nothing but banana bread.
- BOB; Oh, right.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.899
- I looked like an idiot.
- Y-You did.

00:48.946 --> 00:50.913
And ever since then,
Colleen's taken it over

00:50.948 --> 00:53.883
and run that bake sale like
it's her own exclusive club.

00:53.918 --> 00:55.618
But now it's Linda's turn again!

00:55.653 --> 00:57.593
Yeah. Mr. Frond called last night.

00:57.618 --> 01:01.357
I'm gonna show Mean Colleen
Cavi-smello how it's done.

01:01.392 --> 01:02.603
So, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.360
Back up. You knew last night?

01:04.394 --> 01:05.795
- Yeah.
- And you didn't call me?

01:05.830 --> 01:07.396
- Um...
- That's fine.

01:07.591 --> 01:09.390
I was up thinking about
it, but that's fine.

01:09.415 --> 01:11.100
Oh. Yeah.

01:11.125 --> 01:13.491
Bob's Burgers. This is Linda.

01:13.516 --> 01:16.308
Mr. Frond! You must be
calling about the bake sale!

01:16.333 --> 01:17.793
I was thinking we could do a theme,

01:17.818 --> 01:20.042
like Masquerade or Vegas, Baby!

01:20.623 --> 01:23.731
Oh, no! Okay. One of
us will be right there.

01:23.756 --> 01:25.089
Louise is in big trouble,

01:25.124 --> 01:27.333
and one of us has to
go down to the office.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.126
Oh. Okay. You?

01:29.162 --> 01:31.605
Yeah, me. I just got the bake sale.

01:31.630 --> 01:34.183
I am not gonna lose it because
one of our kids is a delinquent.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.091
Right.

01:35.116 --> 01:37.301
You've worked too hard,
Linda! You've come too far.

01:37.336 --> 01:38.903
- Do not lose this!
- Okay, okay. I'm not.

01:38.938 --> 01:40.004
Don't lose it!

01:40.039 --> 01:41.605
- I'm not!
- Where's your keys?

01:41.641 --> 01:42.693
You have everything?
Where's your purse?

01:42.718 --> 01:43.585
Oh, my keys, my keys.

01:43.609 --> 01:44.688
Oh, my God. My-my purse.
Ugh. Okay.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.188
Wait, wait, wait! Let me
fix your hair. Hold on.

01:46.212 --> 01:47.341
I got to go! I got to go!

01:47.366 --> 01:48.809
Okay, okay. Go!

01:48.948 --> 01:50.224
Are you familiar with

01:50.249 --> 01:51.857
in-school suspension, Linda?

01:51.882 --> 01:54.195
Uh, is it like you're suspended

01:54.220 --> 01:56.620
- but you stay at school?
- Mm, not exactly.

01:56.656 --> 01:59.023
It's... Yes, that's basically it.

01:59.058 --> 02:01.358
We've found that regular
suspension was like a day off

02:01.394 --> 02:03.627
for the children, whereas
in-school suspension

02:03.663 --> 02:05.463
is more punitive and educational.

02:05.498 --> 02:07.965
They sit alone in a
room, supervised by me,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.084
and write an essay on
what they did wrong.

02:10.109 --> 02:11.505
What did Louise do wrong?

02:11.530 --> 02:13.623
She pulled down a boy's pants,

02:13.648 --> 02:15.014
exposing his underpants.

02:15.039 --> 02:17.506
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I only did it because

02:17.531 --> 02:19.810
Timmy and Scott O'Brien took
Pocket Sized Rudy's lunch

02:19.835 --> 02:21.235
and wouldn't give it back.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.960
He's so little. He needs to eat.

02:22.985 --> 02:25.385
- And no one else was helping.
- Oh.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.721
Knowing the O'Brien brothers,
that's probably true, Louise,

02:27.746 --> 02:29.365
- but...
- Thank you!

02:29.390 --> 02:31.084
Am I a hero? I don't know.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.569
But Wagstaff has a zero
tolerance pantsing policy.

02:34.594 --> 02:36.227
We're part of a national program

02:36.262 --> 02:38.037
called No Pants Pulled Off Behinds.

02:38.062 --> 02:40.599
Your actions were not appropriate.

02:41.687 --> 02:44.502
Well, sounds like she was
trying to help another kid.

02:44.537 --> 02:45.865
Yes! I was!

02:45.890 --> 02:48.654
Linda, zero tolerance
means zero tolerance.

02:48.679 --> 02:51.169
Not some tolerance. Are
we not on the same page?

02:51.186 --> 02:53.987
Oh! Uh, no, same page. Absolutely.

02:54.023 --> 02:56.089
We're gonna be working
together on that bake sale,

02:56.125 --> 02:57.991
and now this whole
thing happens, you know?

02:58.027 --> 02:59.493
What a crazy world.

02:59.528 --> 03:01.328
Mm. Yes, the bake sale.

03:01.363 --> 03:03.630
It's nice that you stuck up
for the little guy, Louise,

03:03.666 --> 03:05.832
but what you did was wrong. Real wrong.

03:05.868 --> 03:07.802
Great. Thanks, Mom.

03:07.827 --> 03:09.714
I just need you to sign
this permission slip

03:09.738 --> 03:11.872
acknowledging Louise will
spend the rest of the day

03:11.907 --> 03:13.507
in in-school suspension

03:13.542 --> 03:15.842
and that you will come
pick her up after school.

03:15.878 --> 03:17.678
That's what you get for
sticking your neck out

03:17.713 --> 03:19.791
and doing the right thing.
I'll just keep my head down

03:19.815 --> 03:21.848
and mind my own business. Hmm.

03:21.884 --> 03:23.951
Shoot. I completely forgot.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.219
I have to take my
mother to the podiatrist.

03:26.255 --> 03:28.288
She has six ingrown toenails.

03:28.324 --> 03:29.690
On one foot.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.191
Ooh, she sounds nice.

03:31.226 --> 03:33.961
Anyway, we can ask Ms.
Schnur to supervise Louise.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.295
I'm sure she'll agree.

03:35.331 --> 03:37.164
- No.
- Please, Ms. Schnur.

03:37.199 --> 03:39.066
I wouldn't ask if it
weren't an emergency.

03:39.101 --> 03:42.069
I'm busy today. I'm looking
up how every celebrity looks

03:42.104 --> 03:44.071
- without makeup.
- Come on.

03:44.106 --> 03:45.706
You can see the door from your desk.

03:45.741 --> 03:48.742
All you have to do is make
sure no one goes in or out.

03:48.777 --> 03:50.344
Ugh, fine.

03:50.379 --> 03:52.913
Thank you. You really are
the best person for the job.

03:52.948 --> 03:56.249
I know. I'm like that guard
in Shawshank Redemption.

03:56.285 --> 03:57.751
Nothing gets by me.

03:57.786 --> 03:59.920
Have you seen Shawshank Redemption?

03:59.955 --> 04:02.222
Not all the way through. No spoilers!

04:02.257 --> 04:04.891
Okay. And, Louise, any funny business

04:04.927 --> 04:07.327
and you'll get in-school
suspension for a week.

04:07.363 --> 04:10.897
Never helping anyone again.

04:10.933 --> 04:14.167
Okay, I'm, uh, gonna
take Louise in there

04:14.203 --> 04:16.737
to give her one last good
talking-to before I go.

04:16.772 --> 04:18.105
Good. All right.

04:18.140 --> 04:21.108
I'm off to the
podiatrist, Dr. Cornsander.

04:24.319 --> 04:27.748
Just kidding. It's... His
name is Dr. Hand, ironically.

04:27.783 --> 04:30.421
Uh, uh... Okay, I'm leaving.

04:30.446 --> 04:32.930
What you did was very bad, Louise!

04:32.955 --> 04:35.413
And I want you to put
it all in your essay!

04:35.438 --> 04:37.624
- Why are you yelling?
- There are rules, Louise!

04:37.660 --> 04:39.426
And you got to learn to follow 'em!

04:39.461 --> 04:40.894
What are you doing?

04:40.929 --> 04:43.463
You'll see. Just be quiet.

04:44.648 --> 04:46.900
Uh, I just tripped
over... two chairs and a...

04:46.935 --> 04:49.069
and a desk! And that's
what made that loud sound!

04:49.104 --> 04:52.272
Now get out some paper and
start writing, Miss Missy!

04:52.307 --> 04:53.952
I'm gonna lower you out the window.

04:53.976 --> 04:56.376
Leave your stuff here
and meet me at the car.

04:56.412 --> 04:57.989
I don't want to talk
you out of anything,

04:58.013 --> 04:59.579
but why are you doing this?

04:59.615 --> 05:01.915
You did something nice for someone.

05:01.950 --> 05:04.618
Now I want to... do
something nice for you.

05:04.653 --> 05:06.053
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

05:06.088 --> 05:07.935
Ow. Sorry.

05:08.834 --> 05:11.091
- Go to the car.
- This is crazy.

05:11.116 --> 05:12.916
Go. Go, go, go.

05:12.950 --> 05:16.285
And we'll talk more
about this after school.

05:16.389 --> 05:18.087
Did you hear any of that?

05:18.122 --> 05:19.788
I hope I wasn't too hard on her.

05:19.824 --> 05:21.468
Anyway, she's in there
really learning her lesson,

05:21.492 --> 05:23.225
and you won't hear a peep out of her.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.427
Good. I hate hearing peeps.

05:28.304 --> 05:29.503
- We clear?
- Ah!

05:29.528 --> 05:31.128
Louise! You scared me!

05:31.268 --> 05:33.302
What are you... Oh, right,
yeah, this was my idea.

05:33.337 --> 05:35.938
Yeah, and what exactly is
the idea? What are we doing?

05:35.973 --> 05:38.407
Well, listen, what you did was wrong.

05:38.442 --> 05:40.776
Yeah, everybody made that pretty clear.

05:40.811 --> 05:42.811
But I don't want you getting the idea

05:42.847 --> 05:44.580
that helping people
isn't worth it, Louise,

05:44.615 --> 05:46.448
'cause it is, it is worth it.

05:46.484 --> 05:48.829
So, come on, give me your hand.
Look at me, give me your hand.

05:48.853 --> 05:49.918
Okay.

05:49.954 --> 05:52.654
So, my genius mom plan is to reward you

05:52.690 --> 05:54.590
for the good part of what you did

05:54.625 --> 05:56.158
by taking you out for ice cream.

05:56.193 --> 05:57.626
Keep talking.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.328
Then we'll pop you back in the window,

05:59.363 --> 06:01.897
and you can write your essay
and no one will be the wiser.

06:01.932 --> 06:04.566
Or we could blow off
the whole essay thing,

06:04.602 --> 06:07.336
keep driving and start
new lives in Boca.

06:07.371 --> 06:09.304
My hair? In Boca?

06:09.340 --> 06:11.273
What are you... in that humidity?

06:11.308 --> 06:12.508
What are you kidding me?

06:13.711 --> 06:15.294
All right, Bob's Burgers, we made it.

06:15.319 --> 06:16.578
We must be the first.

06:16.614 --> 06:17.913
Hi, welcome. "The first"?

06:17.948 --> 06:19.526
Oh, yeah, there's a
bunch of us coming here.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.016
This is our meeting point.

06:21.052 --> 06:24.586
Your meeting point? A-Are you
just meeting or also eating?

06:24.622 --> 06:26.800
All of it. We dropped some
of our group on the way here,

06:26.824 --> 06:27.790
but they'll show up.

06:27.825 --> 06:29.158
Eventually.

06:29.193 --> 06:30.592
Ha! Eventually.

06:30.628 --> 06:31.593
Right?

06:31.629 --> 06:34.830
"The Glory Glory Jalapeño Burger."
Sounds perfect.

06:34.865 --> 06:36.989
- Two Burgers of the Day, please.
- You got it.

06:37.014 --> 06:38.634
- Does that come with cheese?
- Uh, yeah.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.244
All right, well, same
here, but no cheese.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.950
- Okay.
- Two for me, too.

06:41.975 --> 06:43.605
Oh. You guys are hungry, huh?

06:43.641 --> 06:46.708
We're burning about 4,000
calories on this ride, so, yeah.

06:46.733 --> 06:48.610
Yeah, we'll start with two
and then maybe have a third.

06:48.646 --> 06:49.945
Wow.

06:49.980 --> 06:52.099
- It's good to be young, huh?
- I'm 49.

06:52.124 --> 06:54.232
Oh, my God, I have to start working out.

06:54.257 --> 06:57.686
- Yes, you do.
- Oh, boy. Here are the stragglers.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.399
Hi. Let me just clear
this booth for you guys,

06:59.423 --> 07:01.122
and I'll be right back
to take your order.

07:01.147 --> 07:02.891
Bob, you're swamped.
Let me get that for you.

07:02.927 --> 07:04.359
What? No. Teddy, I mean, thanks,

07:04.395 --> 07:05.627
but don't worry about it.

07:05.663 --> 07:07.196
Why not? I can't clear a table?

07:07.231 --> 07:09.216
It's so very difficult
that only you can do it?

07:09.241 --> 07:10.499
I'm fine, Teddy. I got it.

07:10.534 --> 07:11.733
Fine? Okay, it's fine.

07:11.769 --> 07:13.001
Okay. It's fine! I got it!

07:13.037 --> 07:14.236
Okay, great!

07:14.271 --> 07:15.904
So can you get me some more coffee

07:15.940 --> 07:17.473
when you get a chance?!

07:17.508 --> 07:18.674
Sorry about him.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.843
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.

07:21.018 --> 07:22.484
Oh, boy.

07:23.681 --> 07:24.858
Louise, are you in there?

07:24.882 --> 07:26.415
We heard from Regular Sized Rudy

07:26.450 --> 07:27.816
who heard from Pocket Sized Rudy

07:27.852 --> 07:30.052
that you got in-school suspension.

07:30.087 --> 07:32.521
It's us, Tina and Gene. This is Tina.

07:32.556 --> 07:34.022
No answer. I'm going in.

07:34.058 --> 07:35.669
Gene, no. If we get
caught going in there,

07:35.693 --> 07:36.925
we'll get suspended, too.

07:36.961 --> 07:38.939
It happened to Jimmy Jr.
When he tried to talk to Zeke.

07:38.963 --> 07:40.696
- It's true.
- So courageous.

07:40.731 --> 07:42.097
So now whenever Zeke's suspended,

07:42.133 --> 07:43.499
I just pass him notes.

07:43.534 --> 07:45.045
Those notes really
lifted my spirits, J-Ju!

07:45.069 --> 07:46.735
- Get over here! I got to tell you!
- Ow, Zeke!

07:46.770 --> 07:48.010
- I appreciate it!
- Ow. Ah!

07:48.038 --> 07:49.371
I appreciate the hell out it!

07:49.406 --> 07:51.106
Zeke. Come on, I appreciate you!

07:51.142 --> 07:53.108
Hey!

07:53.151 --> 07:54.783
- Ah!
- Get away from there.

07:54.812 --> 07:56.612
No talking to the suspendee.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.113
Stay strong, Louise, bye.

07:58.149 --> 07:59.381
'Sup, girl?

07:59.416 --> 08:01.350
What's up, Zeke? New shorts?

08:01.385 --> 08:02.784
Yeah.

08:02.820 --> 08:04.086
All right, go to class.

08:04.121 --> 08:06.121
- All right. Bye!
- Bye.

08:06.157 --> 08:07.789
You know, I used to get into trouble

08:07.825 --> 08:09.291
for sticking up for my friends.

08:09.326 --> 08:10.592
- You did?
- Uh-huh.

08:10.628 --> 08:11.927
I pantsed a guy, too.

08:11.962 --> 08:13.529
Yeah, Kenny Kotarski.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.631
He was making fun of
Vicki Tufo's forehead.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.032
She had an enormous forehead.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.300
Like scary big.

08:18.335 --> 08:19.801
Anyway, I even got his underwear.

08:19.837 --> 08:21.103
Everyone saw everything.

08:21.138 --> 08:22.304
What?

08:22.339 --> 08:24.373
Mom. What other bad stuff did you do?

08:24.408 --> 08:26.041
One time, me and your Aunt Gayle

08:26.076 --> 08:27.776
filled up a bunch of water balloons,

08:27.811 --> 08:29.656
and we went in the bathroom
and threw them at the girls

08:29.680 --> 08:31.046
that were pooping.

08:31.081 --> 08:33.115
Wait, who were you sticking up for?

08:33.150 --> 08:35.250
Oh. Well, I mean, they were mean girls.

08:35.285 --> 08:36.763
They were, they were mean pooping girls.

08:36.787 --> 08:38.703
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be at the restaurant?

08:38.727 --> 08:40.054
Don't you work there?

08:40.090 --> 08:41.890
Oh, what, like we're
getting a big rush today?

08:46.130 --> 08:48.230
I like those... outfits.

08:48.255 --> 08:50.098
Thanks. I put on spandex once.

08:50.134 --> 08:51.967
- I couldn't get it off for a week.
- Uh-huh.

08:52.002 --> 08:53.735
Yeah. Went to the E.R.

08:53.771 --> 08:55.482
Doctor said if I was
even five minutes later,

08:55.506 --> 08:57.072
I would've lost a foot.

08:57.107 --> 08:58.307
That was a fun Easter.

08:58.342 --> 08:59.975
Here you go. Uh, sorry for the wait.

09:00.010 --> 09:01.843
Hey, can we get another
round of beer, too?

09:01.879 --> 09:03.679
- And more fries? Like a butt-load?
- Yup.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.981
That'll be just a minute.
I'm-I'm by myself right now.

09:06.016 --> 09:07.849
I mean, my wife should be here.

09:07.885 --> 09:10.898
- I have a wife, she's just not here.
- She's real, though.

09:10.923 --> 09:12.955
This is making me sound like
I don't have a wife. I do.

09:12.990 --> 09:14.323
He does, he definitely does.

09:14.358 --> 09:16.258
- And I do, too.
- Teddy, stop it.

09:16.293 --> 09:17.926
Yeah, her name is Karen McGillicuddy.

09:17.962 --> 09:18.927
Oh, God.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.096
Hi, uh, have a seat.

09:21.131 --> 09:22.664
I'll be right with you.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.228
Where is Linda?

09:27.571 --> 09:28.937
Oh, God help me.

09:28.973 --> 09:31.773
- Eh? Eh?
- Teddy, I could actually use a hand.

09:31.809 --> 09:33.175
Yeah! You won't regret this!

09:33.210 --> 09:35.055
You will not regret it!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

09:35.079 --> 09:37.346
I am in. I am ready.

09:37.381 --> 09:38.780
Give me a thing to put on.

09:38.816 --> 09:39.948
Uh, right?

09:39.984 --> 09:41.183
Oh, here's Linda's, right?

09:41.218 --> 09:43.051
Okay, I'm already regretting this.

09:43.087 --> 09:46.154
But I think you have to take the
orders while I make everything.

09:46.190 --> 09:47.623
I will not let you down, Bobby.

09:47.658 --> 09:49.825
Hello, and welcome to Bob's Burgers.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.893
My name's Teddy and I'll
be your server today.

09:51.929 --> 09:53.369
Can I start you with some appetizers?

09:53.397 --> 09:55.297
Any dietary restrictions
I should know about

09:55.332 --> 09:56.977
- before we get going here?
- Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

09:57.001 --> 09:58.850
- Huh? Too much?
- Yes, dial it back.

09:58.875 --> 09:59.971
I'll try.

09:59.996 --> 10:02.430
Any birthdays? Anyone
celebrating a birthday?

10:03.741 --> 10:05.173
So you wrote her a note, too?

10:05.209 --> 10:06.708
- Big-time.
- What does yours say?

10:06.744 --> 10:08.154
It says, "How ya doing in there, kiddo?"

10:08.178 --> 10:09.389
But then I scratched out "kiddo."

10:09.413 --> 10:11.046
- It felt forced.
- Mine's a picture

10:11.081 --> 10:12.759
of that angry hot dog
I've been drawing lately.

10:12.783 --> 10:14.349
Zeke, Jimmy Jr., what's the best way

10:14.385 --> 10:15.917
to slide these notes under the door?

10:15.953 --> 10:17.586
Here, let me do it.

10:18.889 --> 10:20.522
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

10:20.557 --> 10:22.424
J-Ju can get them right under the desk.

10:22.459 --> 10:23.992
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

10:24.028 --> 10:26.595
'Cause I have a problem
with impulse control.

10:26.630 --> 10:28.664
- Ha-cha!
- And then I'd read it,

10:28.699 --> 10:30.814
write back, and slide it right under.

10:31.702 --> 10:34.392
And slide it back under.

10:35.406 --> 10:36.705
Huh. Come on!

10:36.740 --> 10:39.207
Yeah, Zeke definitely
would've written back by now.

10:39.243 --> 10:41.009
Well, maybe she just didn't see them?

10:41.045 --> 10:42.210
Or maybe she hates us.

10:42.246 --> 10:44.112
She resents us for our freedom.

10:44.148 --> 10:46.948
I told you kids, stay
away from that door!

10:46.984 --> 10:48.784
Are we by this door? Oh, we are.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.285
We were just walking.

10:50.321 --> 10:51.853
And we're still walking. Bye.

10:51.889 --> 10:52.754
Mm.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.022
Poor Louise.

10:54.058 --> 10:56.425
Yeah. She must be having the worst day.

10:59.563 --> 11:01.096
You're all right, Louise.

11:01.131 --> 11:03.265
I don't care what anyone else says.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.300
Back at ya. This has been fun.

11:05.336 --> 11:07.269
Let's do it again
sometime. Can I call you?

11:07.304 --> 11:09.404
I took a magazine from the waiting room.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.272
Did you?

11:10.307 --> 11:11.834
What?

11:12.576 --> 11:15.177
- Fine, I'll mail it back to them.
- Not that.

11:18.282 --> 11:21.083
- He's honking at you.
- I know, Mother.

11:21.118 --> 11:23.118
- Oh, no, Mr. Frond.
- What? Where?

11:23.153 --> 11:24.486
He's right there in his car.

11:27.958 --> 11:28.924
Did he see us?

11:28.959 --> 11:30.158
I don't know, I don't know.

11:30.194 --> 11:31.259
Let's go!

11:32.296 --> 11:33.495
I got to go.

11:33.530 --> 11:36.264
I got a meeting with
the city council... !

11:36.300 --> 11:37.766
- Oh, in there.
- Yes.

11:37.801 --> 11:39.468
Ooh, cotton candy.

11:39.503 --> 11:42.283
- Mom, no, we're hiding!
- Right, right, right.

11:46.745 --> 11:48.678
Oh, don't come in here,

11:48.703 --> 11:50.033
don't come in here, don't come in here.

11:50.058 --> 11:51.416
Ah, nuts, he came in here.

11:51.441 --> 11:52.182
Oh.

11:52.206 --> 11:53.171
Where are we going?

11:53.207 --> 11:54.706
I think I saw a truant student,

11:54.741 --> 11:56.541
and I'm not letting her get away.

11:56.577 --> 11:58.844
Oh, a chase. Fun.

11:58.879 --> 12:00.512
Put on the siren.

12:02.649 --> 12:04.116
Mother. What?

12:04.151 --> 12:06.785
You want to win a goldfish?
Three shots for a dollar.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.287
No. Wait, maybe. No, no, no, thank you.

12:09.323 --> 12:10.889
Oh, boy. This is bad.

12:10.924 --> 12:13.058
I'm gonna get at least
a week's suspension.

12:13.093 --> 12:14.693
I know, and if he sees me,

12:14.728 --> 12:16.394
I can kiss the bake sale good-bye.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.452
- Crap, that's right.
- Yeah.

12:18.477 --> 12:20.376
You want to just take one
look at these goldfish?

12:20.400 --> 12:21.566
They're not all dead.

12:21.602 --> 12:23.368
See, that guy's wiggling a little bit.

12:23.403 --> 12:25.103
He's got some fight in him, huh?

12:25.139 --> 12:27.405
Aw, I love him. Little wiggler.

12:27.441 --> 12:29.407
Frond's coming this way;
we got to go in deeper.

12:34.812 --> 12:38.583
- Uh, can I get extra jalapeños on that?
- You got it.

12:38.619 --> 12:41.897
Two more Burgers of the
Day... Extra jalapeños, buddy!

12:41.922 --> 12:44.222
Shoot. Oh, no, I forget who these go to.

12:44.258 --> 12:45.423
Uh...

12:45.459 --> 12:47.237
D-Didn't you write down a
table number or anything?

12:47.261 --> 12:49.327
No, no, no, I got my own system.

12:49.363 --> 12:50.640
I associate something with their order,

12:50.664 --> 12:53.008
- and then I make a rhyme out of it.
- What?

12:53.033 --> 12:55.641
"The guy with brown
hair wants it medium rare."

12:55.666 --> 12:58.770
"The guy with sunglasses
wants extra cheese." Uh...

12:58.805 --> 13:00.338
That one doesn't rhyme.

13:00.374 --> 13:02.307
They can't all rhyme!
I'm doing all this stuff,

13:02.342 --> 13:04.809
and then I'm trying to come up
with these rhymes... it's hard.

13:04.845 --> 13:06.924
You can just write down the table
numbers, Teddy, or...

13:06.949 --> 13:10.672
No, no, uh, it's too late now,
Bob. We're in the weeds.

13:10.697 --> 13:13.462
Okay, who had a plain
hamburger? Wait, I remember.

13:13.487 --> 13:16.619
"The guy who wants it plain was kind
of a pain." That's you, sir, right?

13:16.644 --> 13:19.916
No, it's the guy who looks
like a weird David Blaine.

13:19.941 --> 13:21.274
Where's he?

13:22.111 --> 13:23.362
I drew another

13:23.397 --> 13:25.297
angry hot dog. This
time, he's at the beach,

13:25.332 --> 13:28.307
- and he's furious at a whale.
- I wrote her an inspirational haiku.

13:28.332 --> 13:29.768
"Hang in there, Louise.

13:29.793 --> 13:32.565
I know it's tough right now, but things
are... " Oh, wait, that's not a haiku.

13:32.590 --> 13:35.324
Uh-oh. They put a guard on the door.

13:35.349 --> 13:37.463
I'll try to distract him
while you slip the notes under.

13:37.488 --> 13:39.252
Hey, Mr. Branca...

13:39.277 --> 13:40.869
- No, no, no, no, no, keep moving.
- Damn.

13:40.894 --> 13:42.360
Ms. Schnur had to use the restroom

13:42.385 --> 13:43.784
and told me to watch this door.

13:43.809 --> 13:45.322
No one in, no one out.

13:45.347 --> 13:46.929
Shoot.

13:46.954 --> 13:49.054
But if two cool kids had notes

13:49.089 --> 13:50.322
or pictures of funny foods,

13:50.357 --> 13:52.041
I might look up here for a second,

13:52.066 --> 13:54.566
and they could slide them under
the door without anyone seeing.

13:54.829 --> 13:56.428
Looking up, up, up, up, up...

13:56.463 --> 13:58.831
Well, how do we know
if that's our situation?

13:58.866 --> 14:00.658
Gene, I think that is our situation.

14:00.683 --> 14:03.116
Did I say "cool kids"?
Let's say slow kids.

14:03.141 --> 14:05.198
- That's us!
- Could you look up again?

14:05.223 --> 14:06.572
Looking up...

14:06.607 --> 14:08.707
- Thanks, Mr. Branca.
- I don't know you!

14:12.279 --> 14:14.446
Whoa, whoa. Uh-oh.
Knocked some peppers out.

14:14.481 --> 14:15.914
I'm just gonna poke 'em back in.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.783
No, no, no, no, Teddy,
don't poke the food.

14:17.818 --> 14:19.596
Ah, shh, shh, shh. I'm just
sticking 'em back in here.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.264
- Get in there, guys.
- What are you doing? No, Teddy.

14:21.288 --> 14:23.033
- Get back in there, come on.
- I don't even know if

14:23.057 --> 14:24.534
you washed your hands; you
shouldn't be touching the food.

14:24.558 --> 14:26.198
Washed my hands? I'm
not a surgeon, Bobby.

14:26.227 --> 14:27.659
We only have a few more orders.

14:27.695 --> 14:29.197
Just keep it together
for a little bit longer.

14:29.222 --> 14:31.022
God, you are really sweating.

14:31.047 --> 14:32.413
Yeah, I'm dripping a little.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.260
Not in the food. Much.

14:34.285 --> 14:36.468
My eyes!

14:36.503 --> 14:37.870
- What? What, what? What?
- My eyes!

14:37.905 --> 14:39.190
Oh, I got jalapeño in my eyes!

14:39.215 --> 14:41.273
Where's your emergency eyewash station?

14:41.308 --> 14:43.475
What? We don't have an
emergency eyewash station.

14:43.510 --> 14:44.869
Oh, Princess Wash-Your-Hands

14:44.894 --> 14:46.526
doesn't have an emergency
eyewash station?!

14:46.551 --> 14:48.869
I can't see, Bob! What
am I supposed to do now?

14:48.894 --> 14:51.027
Just let me take those out.

14:51.052 --> 14:53.019
Ah, no, wait. Bob!

14:53.060 --> 14:55.160
Uh, my other senses are coming up.

14:55.274 --> 14:57.354
Stay on the grill. I can do this.

14:57.379 --> 14:59.513
I'm more alive now than
I've ever been before.

14:59.538 --> 15:01.538
Oh, boy. Who had extra jalapenos?

15:01.563 --> 15:03.729
I can't see you. Use your voice.

15:03.768 --> 15:04.934
I'll remember your voice.

15:04.969 --> 15:06.435
Everyone say something!

15:06.471 --> 15:07.471
Oh, my God.

15:10.283 --> 15:12.408
This is crazy. He's closing in on us.

15:12.443 --> 15:13.776
Can he smell us?

15:13.811 --> 15:15.110
I can. Whew.

15:15.146 --> 15:16.946
And he's between us and the exit.

15:16.981 --> 15:18.158
I mean, we're trapped in here.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.615
Should we just jump into the ocean?

15:19.650 --> 15:20.983
And end it all? Maybe.

15:21.018 --> 15:22.545
No, swim to shore.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.086
Oh. No, gross.

15:24.121 --> 15:25.454
So what should we do?

15:25.490 --> 15:27.490
I can't believe I got us into this mess.

15:27.525 --> 15:28.824
Yeah, exactly.

15:28.860 --> 15:30.159
This is what I've been saying!

15:30.194 --> 15:32.394
You tried to do something nice for me,

15:32.430 --> 15:33.996
and it bit you in the ass.

15:34.031 --> 15:35.431
You're gonna lose the bake sale.

15:35.466 --> 15:38.467
This is why you shouldn't
help people ever!

15:38.503 --> 15:40.135
No! You listen to me.

15:40.171 --> 15:42.071
You're a good person,
Louise, and so am I.

15:42.106 --> 15:43.317
And good people do what's right

15:43.341 --> 15:44.974
even if it bites them in the ass.

15:45.009 --> 15:46.242
I mean the you-know-what.

15:46.277 --> 15:47.810
Don't say "ass," say "bum."

15:47.845 --> 15:48.956
Listen, here's what we're gonna do:

15:48.980 --> 15:50.246
we're gonna turn ourselves in

15:50.281 --> 15:52.192
and I'm gonna tell him
breaking you out of school

15:52.216 --> 15:53.749
was all my idea, and then

15:53.784 --> 15:55.424
maybe you won't get
suspension for a week.

15:55.453 --> 15:56.785
But what about the bake sale?

15:56.821 --> 15:58.320
Well, I have other passions

15:58.356 --> 16:00.356
besides planning an amazing bake sale

16:00.391 --> 16:01.957
and laughing in Colleen Caviello's

16:01.993 --> 16:03.292
conventionally attractive face.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.927
Okay, here's another idea.

16:04.962 --> 16:07.029
We split up and I run right at him.

16:07.064 --> 16:09.798
I'll find cover where I can,
and I got to get real lucky,

16:09.834 --> 16:11.267
but if I can get past him,

16:11.302 --> 16:13.636
I can get back to school before he does.

16:13.671 --> 16:16.105
What? No. You'll definitely get caught.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.107
No, I'll probably get caught,

16:18.142 --> 16:20.376
but you'll definitely
keep that bake sale.

16:20.411 --> 16:22.111
Nope. No. You're not doing that. No.

16:22.146 --> 16:23.479
Sure, sure, I-I know.

16:23.514 --> 16:24.980
I'm just, you know, Spitballing.

16:25.016 --> 16:26.348
Just throwing things out there.

16:26.384 --> 16:28.851
Just trying to solve this predicament.

16:28.886 --> 16:30.819
Oh, Mom, don't panic,

16:30.855 --> 16:32.488
but is that a bee in your boobs?

16:32.523 --> 16:33.622
A bee in my boobs!

16:33.658 --> 16:35.357
Oh, my boobs! Oh, my God!

16:35.393 --> 16:38.127
Oh! Oh, God! Oh. What the... ?

16:38.162 --> 16:40.057
That selfless little stinker.

16:44.646 --> 16:45.924
Come on, Louise.

16:45.940 --> 16:48.074
Those aren't eagles, they're seagulls.

16:48.109 --> 16:50.176
What did I say?

16:50.211 --> 16:51.277
Ah! Oh!

16:51.312 --> 16:52.945
I want to get my face painted.

16:52.981 --> 16:54.080
No, no, no.

16:54.115 --> 16:56.349
We're not here to have fun.

16:56.384 --> 16:57.550
Oh! Oh, my God.

16:57.585 --> 16:59.629
Are you joyless, Phillip?

16:59.654 --> 17:02.088
Don't start that again, Mother!

17:02.123 --> 17:04.393
- Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

17:04.417 --> 17:06.726
You never let me get my face painted.

17:06.761 --> 17:08.207
That is just not true.

17:11.332 --> 17:14.267
Yes! Oh, hey, Mr. Frond.

17:14.301 --> 17:17.270
This must be your mother.
How are you? I'm Linda.

17:17.305 --> 17:18.738
Hello, Linda.

17:18.772 --> 17:20.973
I had six ingrown toenails.

17:21.009 --> 17:23.376
I heard. That is fascinating.

17:23.411 --> 17:25.711
Linda. Funny seeing you here.

17:25.747 --> 17:27.579
I thought I saw Louise just now.

17:27.615 --> 17:28.481
Louise?

17:28.516 --> 17:30.216
No, she's at in-school suspension,

17:30.251 --> 17:31.117
where I left her.

17:31.152 --> 17:32.952
Huh. What are you doing out here?

17:32.987 --> 17:35.421
Me? I came here, uh,

17:35.457 --> 17:36.823
to get my face painted.

17:36.858 --> 17:38.391
It's, uh, like a cheap facial.

17:38.426 --> 17:40.760
See? She knows how to have fun.

17:40.795 --> 17:42.562
- I do.
- Uh-huh.

17:42.597 --> 17:45.331
Mother, we're stopping by the
school before I take you home.

17:45.366 --> 17:46.955
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.334
I'm just happy to be outside.

17:48.369 --> 17:50.837
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want
to talk about the bake sale.

17:50.872 --> 17:52.616
- Uh, I got so many ideas.
- No, Linda, no, get...

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
- Get-get off me!
- Um...

17:53.675 --> 17:54.774
Don't pull on my sleeve.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.109
- No.
- What are you doing?

17:56.134 --> 17:58.570
- All right, we can talk on the phone.
- O-Okay, yeah, sure.

17:58.605 --> 18:00.947
Okay, here I go!

18:00.982 --> 18:02.748
Over to the face paint booth.

18:02.784 --> 18:05.351
- Like I said... before.
- Uh-huh.

18:05.386 --> 18:06.819
Thanks for coming in, you guys.

18:06.855 --> 18:08.855
Are they still here? Did they leave yet?

18:08.890 --> 18:10.323
Yeah, yeah, they're gone, Teddy.

18:10.358 --> 18:11.757
Still-still can't see anything?

18:11.793 --> 18:13.657
Not really, no. I just see shapes.

18:13.682 --> 18:15.595
But just point me in
the direction of a table,

18:15.630 --> 18:17.029
and I will clear it off.

18:17.065 --> 18:18.831
All right, it's okay, Teddy. I got it.

18:18.867 --> 18:20.500
- Do I get to keep the tips?
- Yeah.

18:20.535 --> 18:21.535
- Really?
- Sure.

18:21.569 --> 18:23.047
I mean, you might have
less than you think.

18:23.071 --> 18:24.504
Once you started running around,

18:24.539 --> 18:26.139
blindly slamming into everybody...

18:26.174 --> 18:27.451
- Eh.
- ... knocking them to the ground,

18:27.475 --> 18:28.708
I think they were all...

18:28.743 --> 18:30.554
We were really clicking
there for a while, huh, pal?

18:30.578 --> 18:31.544
- No.
- Yeah?

18:31.579 --> 18:32.778
- No.
- We did all right?

18:32.814 --> 18:34.147
- Not really, no.
- Pretty good?

18:34.182 --> 18:35.548
- No. Pretty bad.
- Yeah.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.283
Eh, we were a real team there, Bobby.

18:37.318 --> 18:38.718
- We were not.
- We were doing it.

18:38.753 --> 18:40.453
- We would... no.
- Oh, we got after it.

18:40.488 --> 18:41.854
- We were at odds.
- Yeah.

18:41.890 --> 18:44.290
You know what? As crazy as it sounds,

18:44.325 --> 18:46.192
I could go for a
jalapeño burger right now.

18:46.227 --> 18:49.128
- Hey, for you, coming right up.
- All right.

18:51.266 --> 18:53.040
Whoa.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.674
Wait here. I'll be right back.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.743
Okay, I'll just count the clouds.

19:03.778 --> 19:06.045
One, two...

19:06.080 --> 19:07.547
two and a half.

19:07.582 --> 19:10.149
Is Louise still in there?

19:10.185 --> 19:11.517
She hasn't left all day.

19:11.553 --> 19:13.019
I'm gonna check.

19:13.054 --> 19:14.987
Okay, I'll sit right
here while you do that.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.556
Good luck to both of us.

19:16.591 --> 19:18.691
Hey, Mr. Frond. We're here for Louise.

19:18.726 --> 19:20.905
She's done her time, man.
We need to reintroduce her

19:20.929 --> 19:22.728
into society, get her used to life

19:22.764 --> 19:24.263
on the outside.

19:24.299 --> 19:25.612
Well, I'm here for Louise, too.

19:25.637 --> 19:29.902
But she's not gonna be here
for us when I open this door!

19:29.938 --> 19:32.205
What? Louise. You're here.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.540
Of course. Where else would I be?

19:34.576 --> 19:36.342
Why are you sweaty and winded?

19:36.377 --> 19:38.678
Um, because it's hot in here?

19:38.713 --> 19:40.031
Where's the air conditioner?

19:40.056 --> 19:41.955
Yeah, where... that's
what I want to know.

19:41.983 --> 19:43.849
Well, where's your essay? Let's see it.

19:43.885 --> 19:45.718
Um...

19:45.753 --> 19:47.286
right here, where I keep my essays.

19:47.322 --> 19:48.721
Hey, that's the notes we've been...

19:48.756 --> 19:50.289
- Uh, Gene.
- Um...

19:50.325 --> 19:51.757
Ha! Just a kid yelling.

19:53.394 --> 19:55.761
It's a lot of drawings
of an angry hot dog

19:55.797 --> 19:57.730
and a poorly formed haiku?

19:57.765 --> 20:00.433
- That seems harsh. Just saying.
- I don't get it.

20:00.468 --> 20:04.370
Well, the angry hot dog
represents who I am, in here,

20:04.405 --> 20:08.708
and then the haiku represents
who I want to be, out there.

20:08.743 --> 20:10.142
But if you don't get it...

20:10.178 --> 20:11.611
I-I get it.

20:11.646 --> 20:14.313
I just thought it might
have a-a meaning beyond

20:14.349 --> 20:16.013
- the obvious meaning.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:16.038 --> 20:17.149
Louise!

20:17.185 --> 20:19.452
Oh, good, you made it. Through the day.

20:19.487 --> 20:21.287
Oh, and my little Teeny and Geeny

20:21.322 --> 20:23.489
are here to visit their jailbird sister.

20:23.524 --> 20:25.424
No matter what she does,
we'll always love her.

20:25.460 --> 20:26.792
Want to talk about the face?

20:26.828 --> 20:28.060
What's there to talk about?

20:28.096 --> 20:29.228
I'm a cat. Meow.

20:29.264 --> 20:30.763
I love this woman!

20:30.798 --> 20:33.637
Hello again, Mr. Frond.
Is Louise free to go?

20:33.662 --> 20:37.570
Uh, she seems to have satisfied
the requirements, so, yes.

20:37.605 --> 20:40.640
Louise, did we learn our lesson today?

20:40.675 --> 20:42.408
We sure did, Mom.

20:42.443 --> 20:45.077
Wait. What was that? Did
you just wink at each other?

20:45.113 --> 20:46.612
Yeah, cats wink.

20:46.648 --> 20:48.581
And some people wink at their cat moms.

20:48.616 --> 20:50.816
And other people leave
their moms in cars

20:50.852 --> 20:52.957
on hot days with all
the windows rolled up.

20:52.982 --> 20:55.187
