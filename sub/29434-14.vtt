01:05.259 --> 01:07.043
That is, uh...

01:07.086 --> 01:09.045
Yeah.

01:09.088 --> 01:11.221
- Very.
- How long has this been going on?

01:11.265 --> 01:12.831
A while.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.443
That's not an answer.

01:15.486 --> 01:17.923
If you want to tell
people things, tell them.

01:17.967 --> 01:19.403
Several months.

01:19.407 --> 01:21.797
You haven't had a good night's
sleep in several months?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.190
But he's not just a workaholic.

01:23.233 --> 01:24.713
It's been hard. Really.

01:24.756 --> 01:26.410
And I'd say it was Christopher's death,

01:26.454 --> 01:28.412
- but it started before.
- Sorry.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.936
- That-that really sucks.
- It does.

01:30.980 --> 01:33.417
And I'm concerned that
it's been affecting my work.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.505
No, it hasn't.

01:34.549 --> 01:36.681
That's nice of you to say. But...

01:36.725 --> 01:39.075
it's hard for me not to think that if I

01:39.118 --> 01:42.426
were sharper...

01:42.470 --> 01:44.950
maybe some of our recent cases

01:44.994 --> 01:46.909
- would have gone differently.
- No...

01:48.084 --> 01:49.607
Anyway,

01:49.651 --> 01:51.392
I'm taking a short medical leave

01:51.435 --> 01:54.743
to enter a specialized
treatment program,

01:54.786 --> 01:57.615
which will hopefully help me figure out

01:57.659 --> 01:59.008
why this is happening.

01:59.051 --> 02:01.924
Why am I getting, like, a Cuckoo's Nest

02:01.967 --> 02:03.621
kind of vibe here?

02:03.665 --> 02:04.722
Nothing like that.

02:04.766 --> 02:06.007
Then what?

02:06.050 --> 02:07.886
Wade and my doctor think

02:07.930 --> 02:11.586
it's been caused by the massive
dose of LSD I was given

02:11.629 --> 02:13.762
when Apollyon captured me.

02:13.805 --> 02:15.198
Which also really sucked.

02:15.242 --> 02:17.635
It seems to have unlocked something.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.810
Only I don't know what.

02:18.854 --> 02:20.943
- So, what's the plan?
- A treatment called

02:20.986 --> 02:23.554
Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy.

02:23.598 --> 02:24.947
Basically, they give me

02:24.990 --> 02:26.836
more LSD in a controlled environment.

02:26.879 --> 02:28.959
So they're giving you more
of what caused the problem

02:28.960 --> 02:30.039
in the first place?

02:30.082 --> 02:31.762
- Microdoses.
- And Wade, she's,

02:31.806 --> 02:32.881
she's cool with this?

02:32.924 --> 02:34.783
She's nervous. So's Rita.

02:34.826 --> 02:37.438
And I can see that you all are, too.

02:37.481 --> 02:41.223
But the alternative is,
I never figure it out.

02:41.267 --> 02:44.793
I never get another
good night's sleep again.

02:44.836 --> 02:49.058
I stop functioning effectively,
and I can no longer...

02:49.101 --> 02:50.755
do the job I love to do

02:50.799 --> 02:53.280
with the people I love doing it with.

02:56.892 --> 02:58.241
Okay.

02:58.285 --> 03:00.374
Well, I got you covered here, brother.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.376
You just do what you need to do.

03:03.681 --> 03:05.509
Well, that's it?

03:05.553 --> 03:08.251
We're not gonna insist
on a second opinion, or

03:08.295 --> 03:09.644
I don't know, do some research

03:09.687 --> 03:11.472
to make sure this
doesn't go terribly wrong?

03:11.515 --> 03:12.864
Done that already.

03:12.908 --> 03:15.258
And there are no guarantees.

03:15.302 --> 03:17.521
But the new guy shows
up in a week or so.

03:17.565 --> 03:22.091
And I'm planning on being back
in time to help ease him in.

03:22.134 --> 03:24.049
I don't know how I
feel about any of this.

03:24.093 --> 03:25.877
Honestly,

03:25.921 --> 03:27.096
neither do I.

03:27.139 --> 03:28.480
But it is the best

03:28.524 --> 03:31.013
bad idea I got right now.

03:40.414 --> 03:42.329
I'll see you.

03:43.913 --> 03:46.350
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

03:46.394 --> 03:49.005
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪

03:49.048 --> 03:51.573
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

03:51.616 --> 03:53.009
♪ How, how, how, how ♪

03:53.052 --> 03:54.524
♪ Hey, hey ♪

04:01.060 --> 04:02.140
♪ You gotta come on. ♪

04:08.833 --> 04:10.400
I'm more of a jazz guy.

04:10.444 --> 04:12.184
And I like roots acoustic,

04:12.228 --> 04:14.099
but this is the medically
sanctioned approach.

04:14.143 --> 04:16.579
Yeah, they've done some
studies. Reduces blood pressure.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.452
Enhances rather than distracts from

04:18.495 --> 04:20.410
the effects of the psychedelics.

04:20.454 --> 04:22.134
Well, it makes me think
I'm in an elevator.

04:22.135 --> 04:23.165
Well, that works, too.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.545
We are going on a journey.

04:27.112 --> 04:28.592
That's it?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.202
Yeah. It's amazing how powerful

04:30.246 --> 04:32.509
a synthesized psychedelic can be.

04:32.553 --> 04:33.641
That's the lowest dose.

04:33.684 --> 04:35.124
The effects will last about an hour.

04:35.164 --> 04:36.764
We will be monitoring
you the whole time.

04:36.765 --> 04:38.080
It'll be like a lucid dream,

04:38.123 --> 04:39.821
and Dr. Tanaka will guide you through it

04:39.864 --> 04:43.085
using the dream elements that
you've already experienced.

04:43.128 --> 04:45.435
I just need to know who he is.

04:45.479 --> 04:46.697
And your subconscious

04:46.741 --> 04:48.307
may not want to tell us.

04:48.351 --> 04:50.309
Well, I can't go on the way I've been.

04:50.353 --> 04:53.878
Dr. Tanaka's concerned

04:53.922 --> 04:55.489
it might make things worse.

04:55.532 --> 04:58.492
Rock, meet hard place.

04:58.535 --> 04:59.928
When you're ready,

04:59.971 --> 05:03.410
just place that tab on
your tongue, Dwayne.

05:08.806 --> 05:10.417
All right.

05:11.548 --> 05:13.420
Okay.

05:30.214 --> 05:31.389
Pelicans won last night, Roy.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.352
Why the grumpy face?

05:33.396 --> 05:34.702
Y'all have company.

05:34.745 --> 05:36.747
Made himself right at home.

05:41.665 --> 05:42.927
Can we help you?

05:42.971 --> 05:44.891
Unless you're willing to
fetch me some whole milk

05:44.892 --> 05:47.541
instead of this abominable two percent,

05:47.584 --> 05:49.151
then no, you cannot.

05:49.194 --> 05:50.195
Who the hell are you?

05:51.983 --> 05:53.242
Apparently, I'm the man

05:53.285 --> 05:56.463
who's gonna bring a little
class to this backwater post.

05:56.506 --> 05:58.377
Mm. First thing on my
to-do is to replace

05:58.421 --> 06:01.511
this piece of crap. Man cannot
survive on subpar cappuccinos.

06:01.555 --> 06:03.034
Well, I mean, we've been

06:03.078 --> 06:05.646
surviving just fine on burnt
coffee from a pot, Mr...

06:05.689 --> 06:07.604
Special Agent Carter.

06:07.648 --> 06:09.998
NCIS Special Agent Quentin Carter.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.522
Yeah, you weren't supposed
to transfer in till next week.

06:12.566 --> 06:15.394
Yeah, well, I guess I'm here early.

06:18.876 --> 06:21.052
Looks like this desk is available.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.664
Paperwork should already be in

06:23.707 --> 06:25.027
Special Agent Pride's in-box, but

06:25.056 --> 06:27.450
you know what? Just in case...

06:29.473 --> 06:31.672
This was the desk of your
guy. The one you lost.

06:31.715 --> 06:33.587
His names was Christopher Lasalle.

06:33.630 --> 06:34.979
My condolences.

06:35.023 --> 06:37.155
It's clear from your
attachment to the desk

06:37.199 --> 06:38.243
that he was well-loved.

06:38.287 --> 06:39.810
We're not attached to the desk.

06:39.854 --> 06:41.769
Good. Me neither. Dip
it in bronze if you like,

06:41.812 --> 06:43.901
'cause I prefer a standing desk.

06:47.339 --> 06:49.820
I think we got off on
the wrong foot here.

06:50.464 --> 06:52.736
Um, Agent Lund.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.213
Agent Gregorio.

06:57.811 --> 06:59.529
Agent Khoury.

07:04.618 --> 07:06.054
Allow me to say how

07:06.097 --> 07:08.839
enthusiastic I am to unburden you

07:08.883 --> 07:10.101
of your toughest cases.

07:10.145 --> 07:12.060
We didn't ask for your help, hotshot.

07:12.103 --> 07:13.670
No, no, no,

07:13.714 --> 07:14.802
your boss did.

07:14.845 --> 07:17.544
Requested my transfer from Pearl Harbor.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.110
Where is Special Agent Pride, anyway?

07:19.154 --> 07:20.411
He's on medical leave.

07:20.455 --> 07:21.504
For what?

07:21.548 --> 07:23.027
That's none of your damn business.

07:24.115 --> 07:25.552
You're right.

07:25.595 --> 07:27.162
Best to keep it professional.

07:27.205 --> 07:28.555
No need to know any of you

07:28.598 --> 07:30.731
- beyond these four walls.
- Nope.

07:30.774 --> 07:31.949
Hey, NOPD's

07:31.993 --> 07:33.211
requesting our assistance.

07:33.255 --> 07:34.735
Crime scene in the Bywater.

07:35.678 --> 07:37.063
I'll drive.

07:40.509 --> 07:41.585
Permission to kill him?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.139
I can make it look like an accident.

07:43.282 --> 07:45.282
Okay, charitably, let's just
say he's uncomfortable

07:45.326 --> 07:46.414
filling Lasalle's shoes.

07:46.457 --> 07:47.530
Uncharitably?

07:47.534 --> 07:48.974
Let's put a pin in that murder idea.

07:48.975 --> 07:50.615
Why don't you guys go
see what NOPD needs?

07:57.932 --> 08:00.412
Look, I was nothing but polite to her.

08:00.456 --> 08:02.536
And the next thing I knew,
she put me flat on my ass.

08:02.537 --> 08:03.677
PFC Daniela Ortiz.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.766
I wouldn't want to tussle
with a Marine, either.

08:05.809 --> 08:07.898
Second Marine Expeditionary Brigade.

08:07.942 --> 08:10.062
I served alongside them
during my first tour overseas.

08:10.063 --> 08:12.250
Some of the toughest
Marines on the planet.

08:12.294 --> 08:14.454
You were lucky to walk away
with just that bruised arm.

08:15.055 --> 08:16.546
Thanks?

08:17.190 --> 08:18.510
You said she tried to buy

08:18.512 --> 08:20.695
- groceries with this ID?
- Yeah.

08:20.737 --> 08:23.000
Wide-eyed, sweaty, acting all erratic.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.654
She was clearly on something.

08:24.698 --> 08:27.122
And when I told her she had to
pay with cash or credit card,

08:27.165 --> 08:29.345
but she threw that ID at my
head and jumped me, man.

08:29.346 --> 08:31.661
Hey. You guys need to see this.

08:31.705 --> 08:34.664
So, I downloaded the
store's security feeds.

08:34.707 --> 08:38.102
I would definitely file this
under cinema violent vérité.

08:38.145 --> 08:39.712
Sorry, very what now?

08:39.716 --> 08:40.956
You know, observational cinema?

08:40.957 --> 08:42.236
The Maysles Brothers?

08:42.280 --> 08:44.080
We, we just watched
"Grey Gardens" last night.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.028
Another two hours of my
life I'll never get back.

08:46.029 --> 08:47.677
It's a classic, and
you said you liked it.

08:47.721 --> 08:50.071
Oh, so you two...

08:50.114 --> 08:52.726
- Us? No.
- Oh, no. Roommates only.

08:52.769 --> 08:54.073
But I can expect more of this

08:54.075 --> 08:55.468
- old married couple vibe?
- Yeah.

08:55.511 --> 08:56.668
Well, I mean, no.

08:56.712 --> 08:57.979
- It depends on...
- Just relax.

08:58.022 --> 08:59.502
You're overcompensating and it shows.

08:59.546 --> 09:01.266
Oh, right, yeah. 'Cause
you're the profiler.

09:01.267 --> 09:02.474
Yep. I am. And just spending

09:02.518 --> 09:04.128
a few very painful moments with you,

09:04.172 --> 09:05.739
I'm working up a doozy of a profile.

09:05.782 --> 09:06.783
- Carry on.
- Okay.

09:06.827 --> 09:07.828
Please.

09:09.830 --> 09:10.831
Mm.

09:16.793 --> 09:18.839
The Few, the Proud,

09:18.882 --> 09:21.580
- the You Don't Want to Mess with Us.
- Yeah, so what set her off?

09:21.624 --> 09:23.757
Guy inside said she might've
been on something.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.716
Well, if she still is, we better
find PFC Ortiz right away.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.675
NOPD's got a BOLO out.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.999
All right, well, I got the name
and address of her mother.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.680
Let the other one know I'll
have Mom meet us at NCIS.

09:33.723 --> 09:35.638
"The other one"? You
talking about Hannah?

09:35.682 --> 09:37.205
Sure.

09:39.729 --> 09:42.210
Okay, Dwayne, let's start
with the most recent dream,

09:42.253 --> 09:43.994
the street festival.

09:44.038 --> 09:45.822
You're in the middle of it.

09:58.226 --> 10:00.271
You want to find the
Man in the Red Suit,

10:00.315 --> 10:02.056
but what else do you see?

10:02.099 --> 10:04.101
Look around.

10:12.893 --> 10:14.133
His heart rate's climbing.

10:14.938 --> 10:17.449
Okay. Take a deep breath, Dwayne.

10:17.493 --> 10:18.550
You're in control.

11:03.639 --> 11:04.901
All right.

11:05.745 --> 11:07.774
Enough games.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.777
Talk to me.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.148
What do you want with me?

11:44.455 --> 11:46.810
It was the same as last time,
except for the numbers.

11:47.153 --> 11:48.546
One, five, six, two?

11:48.590 --> 11:50.770
Yeah, over and over.

11:50.814 --> 11:52.816
In no particular order that I could see.

11:52.859 --> 11:54.296
How did it all make you feel?

11:54.338 --> 11:55.818
The numbers, the Man in the Red Suit,

11:55.819 --> 11:57.734
being back in the street fair?

11:57.777 --> 11:59.692
Confused.

12:00.236 --> 12:01.646
Agitated.

12:01.690 --> 12:03.870
Your heart rate spiked significantly.

12:03.914 --> 12:05.263
Well, I wasn't in any danger.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.438
Maybe not in the dream.

12:06.482 --> 12:08.179
The numbers seem important.

12:08.223 --> 12:09.702
You have any idea what they mean?

12:09.746 --> 12:10.964
No.

12:11.008 --> 12:12.836
Well, then, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

12:12.879 --> 12:17.057
Otherwise, I suspect Dr. Tanaka
will be reluctant to continue.

12:17.101 --> 12:20.143
We need an anchor for your
subconscious to hold onto.

12:20.186 --> 12:22.667
Unlock the secret behind those numbers

12:22.711 --> 12:24.713
and we can talk about trying again.

12:34.605 --> 12:36.164
That's enough.

12:37.904 --> 12:40.298
- Sergeant Ortiz...
- Call me Rosa.

12:40.942 --> 12:42.731
I've been out of the
Corps for ten years now.

12:42.774 --> 12:44.328
Thank you for your service.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.956
Semper fi. Do or die.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.175
You were in the Marines?

12:47.218 --> 12:49.220
- 1st Reconnaissance Battalion.
- Force Recon?

12:49.264 --> 12:51.440
I should be thanking
you for your service.

12:51.483 --> 12:54.584
Rosa, do you have any
idea why Daniela...

12:54.586 --> 12:55.619
Dani.

12:55.661 --> 12:57.228
My daughter goes by Dani.

12:58.372 --> 13:00.971
...what might've made
Dani act out like this?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.451
I have no idea.

13:02.494 --> 13:05.149
She was doing well since she
got back from Afghanistan.

13:05.193 --> 13:08.021
Her record is unblemished until now.

13:08.065 --> 13:10.154
Great reports, multiple commendations,

13:10.198 --> 13:12.635
Purple Heart she earned
while serving in Afghanistan.

13:12.641 --> 13:14.201
The injury that brought her home.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.377
Her unit was ambushed

13:15.420 --> 13:16.943
in the Kunduz province 18 months ago.

13:17.987 --> 13:19.294
It's a viper's nest.

13:19.337 --> 13:22.337
IED sent her Humvee
tumbling down a steep hillside.

13:22.338 --> 13:25.300
She shattered three vertebrae,
got sent home for good.

13:25.343 --> 13:27.084
You must've been relieved.

13:27.127 --> 13:28.687
- I was glad to have her home...
- Yeah.

13:28.694 --> 13:31.436
...safe at a desk instead
of a conflict zone,

13:31.480 --> 13:33.003
but Dani felt different.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.570
She felt like she failed?

13:34.613 --> 13:36.006
She did not fail.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.008
Her back was basically broken.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.451
Well, Marines embrace pain,

13:39.488 --> 13:41.488
push through the barrier,
be it physical or mental,

13:41.489 --> 13:42.752
to reach our destination.

13:43.295 --> 13:45.868
Dani was starting to lose her battle

13:45.911 --> 13:47.235
even before the injury.

13:47.278 --> 13:48.584
How so?

13:48.627 --> 13:50.455
Her second tour was rough.

13:50.499 --> 13:54.894
The things she saw left her
walking a razor's edge.

13:54.938 --> 13:56.200
And then she got injured.

13:56.244 --> 13:57.984
It offered her a path home.

13:58.028 --> 14:00.073
The spinal surgeries, the
pain management program,

14:00.117 --> 14:01.858
they're the only
reason she's still alive.

14:01.901 --> 14:03.729
Is Dani still on medication?

14:03.773 --> 14:05.340
Doctors tapered her off months ago.

14:05.383 --> 14:07.211
What about PTSS?

14:07.255 --> 14:09.126
She said her doctors cleared her.

14:10.169 --> 14:12.129
Despite what Dani did,

14:12.172 --> 14:16.655
you need to know, she is a good Marine.

14:16.699 --> 14:18.875
Please...

14:18.918 --> 14:20.659
don't let her get hurt.

14:20.703 --> 14:22.661
Marines look after each other, okay?

14:22.705 --> 14:25.316
I'll get her home safely, I promise.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.276
Let me walk you to your car.

14:32.541 --> 14:33.759
Hey.

14:33.803 --> 14:37.023
Is that a promise you
think you can keep?

14:37.067 --> 14:39.591
I made it, so now I have to.

14:40.435 --> 14:41.724
Well,

14:41.767 --> 14:43.269
the new guy showed up early.

14:43.304 --> 14:45.204
Ah, guess I shouldn't be surprised.

14:45.205 --> 14:46.525
He's got that kind of reputation.

14:46.526 --> 14:49.486
Yeah, I'm not surprised
he's got a reputation.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.124
Sounds like you're
getting along already.

14:51.168 --> 14:52.691
No, he's fine.

14:52.735 --> 14:55.999
It's just... Lasalle's shoes
are hard to fill, you know?

14:58.044 --> 14:59.307
Truth.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.049
I'm really calling because
I'm checking on you.

15:04.616 --> 15:06.270
Oh, I'm-I'm fine.

15:06.314 --> 15:07.837
Any progress?

15:07.880 --> 15:11.493
Uh, well, let's just say
it's been interesting.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.060
Okay.

15:14.104 --> 15:16.193
Nice being worried about.

15:16.236 --> 15:18.456
Well, you let me know if
you need anything, okay?

15:18.500 --> 15:19.718
Absolutely.

15:19.762 --> 15:21.416
Go find that Marine.

15:21.459 --> 15:23.505
Right now, she needs you more than I do.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.810
Okay.

15:26.769 --> 15:28.292
Want to play gin rummy?

15:28.336 --> 15:30.250
Ah, not my game,

15:30.294 --> 15:32.340
but I thought maybe a prop might help.

15:32.383 --> 15:34.690
You know, let's assume
that the Man in the Red Suit

15:34.733 --> 15:38.346
wanted to show you
these cards for a reason.

15:46.963 --> 15:48.268
It was these.

15:48.312 --> 15:50.532
Six of diamonds, five of hearts,

15:50.575 --> 15:53.535
two of clubs, and ace of spades.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.101
These right here.

15:55.145 --> 15:56.755
Let's add them up.

15:56.799 --> 15:58.322
One, three,

15:58.366 --> 16:01.630
- eight, 14.
- No.

16:01.673 --> 16:04.197
Six, five, two, one. We're
missing a four and a three.

16:04.241 --> 16:06.548
No. Diamonds, hearts,

16:06.591 --> 16:09.246
clubs, spades, clubs. No.

16:10.465 --> 16:12.205
It means something.

16:12.249 --> 16:15.252
It matters. To you.

16:19.343 --> 16:21.389
Okay. One, two, five, six.

16:21.432 --> 16:22.651
No.

16:22.694 --> 16:25.697
Five, six, one, t...

16:27.264 --> 16:31.834
Six, two, five, one.

16:31.877 --> 16:33.662
Chords.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.448
Circle of fifths, chord progression.

16:37.492 --> 16:39.798
I learned it when I first
started playing the piano.

16:39.842 --> 16:41.800
How does that connect to
the Man in the Red Suit?

16:41.844 --> 16:43.541
I don't know. Where's Dr. Tanaka?

16:43.585 --> 16:44.890
Um...

16:46.631 --> 16:49.025
I need you to e-mail that
file to me right away.

16:49.068 --> 16:51.897
Thank you. That was the
Naval physician who oversaw

16:51.941 --> 16:54.291
PFC Ortiz's last surgical
recovery at Belle Chasse.

16:54.334 --> 16:56.641
Will they find out why she was
wigging out at the market?

16:56.685 --> 16:59.165
Uh, she wasn't certain, but said
the behaviors that I described

16:59.166 --> 17:01.733
- could be a reaction to medication.
- Okay, well,

17:01.777 --> 17:03.657
did her medical records
say she was on anything?

17:03.658 --> 17:05.737
That's the thing, she's not.
Physician last saw her

17:05.781 --> 17:07.621
three months ago when
she finished tapering off

17:07.622 --> 17:09.175
her pain meds.

17:09.219 --> 17:11.419
What if she was on something
that wasn't in her records?

17:12.396 --> 17:15.704
Look at Ortiz's bank statements.

17:15.747 --> 17:17.749
Over the same period, she's been making

17:17.792 --> 17:20.098
multiple ATM withdrawals every week,

17:20.124 --> 17:21.404
sometimes twice in the same day.

17:21.405 --> 17:23.363
Before that, it was only once a month.

17:23.406 --> 17:24.767
Maybe her violent behavior was due

17:24.800 --> 17:26.454
to a different kind of withdrawal?

17:26.497 --> 17:27.624
The pain meds.

17:27.666 --> 17:28.668
Doctors cut her off,

17:28.712 --> 17:30.327
but she didn't cut herself off.

17:30.370 --> 17:33.286
Self-medicating is a
dangerous path to go down.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.530
Can't know what exactly you're
putting into your system.

17:35.574 --> 17:38.335
Yeah, let's locate Ortiz before
she hurts herself, or anyone else.

17:38.378 --> 17:40.659
Phone's no good. She ditched
it outside the grocery store.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.992
Sebastian's monitoring NOPD
and surrounding agencies.

17:43.035 --> 17:44.428
There's still no hit on the BOLO.

17:44.472 --> 17:46.474
Okay, let's dig through
patterns in her movements.

17:46.517 --> 17:47.757
If she is on the hunt for meds,

17:47.779 --> 17:49.539
she'll likely circle back
to the same places.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.782
Let's go.

17:50.826 --> 17:55.178
Okay, take a deep
breath, close your eyes,

17:55.221 --> 17:57.180
and think about the chords.

17:57.223 --> 18:00.488
Not the fact of them,
the emotional aspect.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.482
I know about the chords.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.920
What are you trying to tell me?

19:00.469 --> 19:01.792
Yes.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.490
Am I doing it right, Red?

19:04.534 --> 19:05.665
You sure are, Dwayne.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.972
Now let me show you something else.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.235
So it's easy to find a new key

19:10.279 --> 19:13.935
using that circle of
fifths I told you about.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.414
It's a chord progression

19:15.458 --> 19:17.765
that allows you to move the
song in almost any direction.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.900
And now we're in "E".

19:30.690 --> 19:33.650
Hop in.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.256
I don't think I could ever do that.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.823
Oh, sure you can.

19:53.866 --> 19:56.478
I know it looks hard now,
but all it takes is practice.

19:56.521 --> 20:00.177
Now start back here in
"C", just take your time.

20:14.604 --> 20:15.910
Why?

20:24.255 --> 20:25.735
- Did you get a last name?
- No.

20:25.778 --> 20:28.172
My younger self called him "Red",

20:28.215 --> 20:30.087
otherwise, I wouldn't even know that.

20:30.130 --> 20:32.959
Man in a red suit, named "Red"?

20:33.003 --> 20:34.874
I'm just disappointed
that your subconscious

20:34.918 --> 20:36.920
isn't more sophisticated than mine.

20:36.951 --> 20:38.311
Well, if he played at the Trutone,

20:38.312 --> 20:40.272
there's got to be some
kind of tax records, right?

20:40.273 --> 20:42.884
- Destroyed long ago.
- Look, we'll figure out how to find him

20:42.928 --> 20:45.624
and get you what you need to
keep getting those treatments.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.801
Oh. Hey, Special Agent
Carter showed up early.

20:48.845 --> 20:50.847
Who's gonna fill me in?

20:52.849 --> 20:56.766
You should take care of yourself first.

20:57.941 --> 20:59.681
Then you'll meet him.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.988
Okay.

21:02.032 --> 21:04.121
How about I just get
you all another round

21:04.164 --> 21:06.601
and see if that'll maybe
loosen up some lips?

21:11.781 --> 21:12.825
Baby.

21:20.050 --> 21:24.228
It's better if your daddy
doesn't know about Red.

21:24.271 --> 21:26.708
Know what about him, Mama?

21:28.998 --> 21:30.756
Here, let me help you with this.

21:32.488 --> 21:34.455
Pride.

21:34.499 --> 21:36.501
- You okay?
- Mm, yeah.

21:36.544 --> 21:38.346
Yeah, I-I'll be right there.

21:38.390 --> 21:39.547
- You got 'em?
- Yeah.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.811
Okay. Thanks.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.606
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

21:54.649 --> 21:56.086
Hey. We brought pastries.

21:56.129 --> 21:58.262
You trying to soften me up?

21:58.305 --> 21:59.916
Does he need to?

21:59.959 --> 22:01.613
Depends.

22:01.656 --> 22:03.745
Were there any residual
effects last night?

22:03.789 --> 22:05.356
- Any new nightmares?
- No.

22:05.399 --> 22:06.879
I won't say I slept like a baby,

22:06.923 --> 22:08.576
but baby adjacent.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.448
I'll take it.

22:10.491 --> 22:11.797
I realized that Red

22:11.841 --> 22:14.278
is connected to my mother.

22:14.321 --> 22:15.975
And I tried to call her this morning,

22:16.019 --> 22:18.978
but the nurses said she
was having a bad day.

22:19.022 --> 22:20.806
Well, if you think she knows something,

22:20.850 --> 22:22.677
it might be better to wait.

22:22.721 --> 22:24.961
Well, there's no way to know
when a better day will come.

22:24.962 --> 22:27.355
I'd really like to press forward.

22:29.728 --> 22:33.601
No adverse affects,
no visions, et cetera?

22:33.645 --> 22:36.691
No. Nope. Nothing.

22:36.735 --> 22:39.999
Okay. Then I'm willing
to go another round.

22:42.915 --> 22:44.927
Please report to Window 9

22:44.929 --> 22:46.224
for methadone distribution.

22:46.266 --> 22:48.703
Yeah, that's her. You
said her real name's Dani?

22:48.747 --> 22:50.314
Private First Class Daniela Ortiz,

22:50.357 --> 22:51.881
United States Marine Corps.

22:51.924 --> 22:53.844
Now, we tracked her phone
coming to this location

22:53.883 --> 22:55.623
several times over the past few weeks.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.973
I'm surprised she's a Marine,

22:57.016 --> 22:58.844
not surprised she gave
a fake name and ID.

22:58.848 --> 23:00.168
At least half of our patients do.

23:00.169 --> 23:01.499
Why's that, Mr. Anders?

23:01.542 --> 23:03.153
Uh, shame from family and friends.

23:03.196 --> 23:04.937
Fear of workplace retaliation.

23:04.981 --> 23:07.722
Addiction isn't something
anyone is proud of.

23:07.766 --> 23:09.724
Did she say why she came
here seeking treatment?

23:09.768 --> 23:11.639
She said she was injured
on a job from a fall

23:11.683 --> 23:13.643
and her back surgeon
wouldn't renew her pain meds,

23:13.644 --> 23:14.729
but she was still hurting.

23:14.773 --> 23:16.122
She ever talk about self-dosing?

23:16.166 --> 23:18.908
Uh, black market opioids.
Cheap, easy to come by,

23:18.951 --> 23:20.788
but you don't always
know what you're getting.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.803
As if managing pain
isn't dangerous enough.

23:22.847 --> 23:25.347
Look, what you're describing
is a textbook reaction

23:25.348 --> 23:26.959
to quitting cold turkey.

23:27.003 --> 23:28.613
What else is textbook?

23:28.656 --> 23:30.658
Uh, seizures, hallucinations.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.422
And who knows how
she'll react the next time

23:32.423 --> 23:33.583
something doesn't go her way.

23:33.598 --> 23:34.706
Sebastian.

23:34.749 --> 23:36.789
BOLO panned out. They got
a location on Ortiz's car.

23:36.795 --> 23:38.449
Thank you, Mr. Anders.
We'll be in touch.

23:38.492 --> 23:39.972
Thanks.

23:49.764 --> 23:51.244
Clear.

23:53.899 --> 23:55.640
Think she could be somewhere nearby?

23:55.683 --> 23:58.251
No idea, but it's possible she
came around here for a reason.

23:58.295 --> 23:59.905
She left the keys in the ignition.

23:59.949 --> 24:01.951
Well, could mean she wasn't
coming back, but why?

24:03.169 --> 24:05.171
Oh, hold on now.

24:08.958 --> 24:10.872
The only thing more
dangerous than a Marine...

24:12.700 --> 24:14.224
...is an armed Marine.

24:14.267 --> 24:15.790
Yeah.

24:15.834 --> 24:19.577
Okay, Dwayne. Think
about Red and the bar.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.361
Think about your mother.

24:21.405 --> 24:24.756
You don't have to know what it
means, just feel the feelings,

24:24.799 --> 24:26.540
see where they take you.

24:30.805 --> 24:32.764
Mama? Where are you?

24:33.939 --> 24:35.680
Get out!

24:35.723 --> 24:37.812
You got to...

24:37.856 --> 24:39.026
take me to Mama!

24:39.070 --> 24:41.729
I'm scared.

24:51.522 --> 24:53.959
I'm scared, too.

25:07.668 --> 25:09.366
All right, help me set
the table, Dwayne.

25:09.409 --> 25:11.455
Everybody will be here soon.

25:13.239 --> 25:14.240
Yep.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.899
Just, uh...

25:25.512 --> 25:27.819
Your daddy's earlier
than I thought he'd be.

25:27.862 --> 25:28.907
Come here.

25:35.957 --> 25:37.220
Daddy.

25:37.263 --> 25:39.004
Ooh!

25:39.048 --> 25:41.920
Oh, been a few months since
your mama brung you to see me.

25:41.963 --> 25:44.836
Look how much you grew.

25:44.879 --> 25:46.881
- I'm almost 54 inches.
- Yeah?

25:46.925 --> 25:49.884
Well, I'd say that makes
you about 53 inches. Hmm?

25:49.928 --> 25:51.321
But you real big.

25:51.364 --> 25:52.626
Cassius, we...

25:52.670 --> 25:54.019
so happy to finally have you...

25:57.979 --> 25:59.590
Everybody will be here soon

25:59.633 --> 26:01.073
- for your welcome home dinner.
- Ah.

26:01.074 --> 26:02.810
I made your favorite everything.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.986
Well, don't let them eat all of it.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.350
Me and Dwayne got a couple things

26:06.379 --> 26:08.077
to take care of first, don't we?

26:08.990 --> 26:10.514
Can't it wait?

26:10.557 --> 26:11.558
The food will get cold.

26:11.602 --> 26:13.343
It'll reheat just fine.

26:18.957 --> 26:20.611
His blood pressure's 150/90.

26:20.654 --> 26:22.917
That's too high. Dwayne,
I need you to come back.

26:22.961 --> 26:25.137
It's okay.

26:25.181 --> 26:28.097
I am not gonna leave you.

26:29.098 --> 26:31.143
Let him stay with me.

26:31.187 --> 26:32.753
There's still a lot to get done

26:32.797 --> 26:34.668
before everybody gets
here and he can help.

26:34.712 --> 26:36.322
No, Mena, he's coming with me.

26:36.366 --> 26:38.324
Come on.

26:38.368 --> 26:41.893
I'm sure you can get done
whatever needs to get done.

27:00.955 --> 27:03.044
Can you let me out?

27:05.612 --> 27:06.861
I-I got to go with him.

27:06.905 --> 27:07.962
Get in.

27:08.006 --> 27:09.094
No, no, no. Wait.

27:09.138 --> 27:10.443
Please don't take him!

27:10.487 --> 27:12.053
Please don't!

27:12.097 --> 27:14.099
No. Somebody,

27:14.143 --> 27:15.883
let me out!

27:20.975 --> 27:22.890
This isn't real, Dwayne.

27:22.934 --> 27:24.544
You're in charge.

27:24.588 --> 27:26.024
And it's time to wake up.

27:39.339 --> 27:40.949
She's been lying to me for months?

27:40.993 --> 27:42.864
Not just you, Rosa. Everyone.

27:42.908 --> 27:44.344
This is my fault.

27:44.387 --> 27:46.302
Why would you say that?

27:46.346 --> 27:48.130
Dani's addiction,

27:48.174 --> 27:50.263
- it must be genetic.
- You also struggled

27:50.306 --> 27:51.664
with pain meds?

27:51.707 --> 27:53.440
Alcohol.

27:54.528 --> 27:56.399
You think Dani knew?

27:56.443 --> 27:58.445
Yes.

27:58.489 --> 27:59.968
The terror I saw on her face

28:00.012 --> 28:01.970
one morning after she spent an hour

28:02.014 --> 28:05.583
trying to wake me is what
got me into treatment.

28:05.626 --> 28:08.194
I've been sober since,

28:08.197 --> 28:09.717
but blind to my own child's suffering.

28:09.718 --> 28:11.197
Rosa,

28:11.240 --> 28:13.199
your daughter is out there with a gun.

28:13.242 --> 28:14.962
Okay? We found her
car in the Irish Channel,

28:14.963 --> 28:16.245
but we didn't find her.

28:16.289 --> 28:17.986
Do you have any idea where she could be?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.510
The Irish Channel?

28:19.553 --> 28:21.207
Yeah. Near Laurel Street and St. Mary.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.556
That's not too far from the gym

28:22.600 --> 28:24.602
where Dani used to
play basketball as a kid.

28:24.645 --> 28:26.821
I used to coach her rec teams there.

28:28.562 --> 28:29.581
Thank you.

28:29.624 --> 28:30.922
I had to wake you, Dwayne.

28:30.965 --> 28:33.837
Otherwise we risked
permanent damage, a stroke.

28:33.881 --> 28:36.001
I was right on the edge of
figuring out what happened.

28:36.002 --> 28:38.581
Please, I just need one more session.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.557
You're worse than my
children. The answer is no.

28:40.595 --> 28:42.515
I can't live the rest of
my life without knowing.

28:42.716 --> 28:44.276
What if today is the rest of your life?

28:44.278 --> 28:45.428
I'm not gonna die, Loretta.

28:45.470 --> 28:46.876
I'm too stubborn.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.661
I'm not gonna let you hurt yourself.

28:48.704 --> 28:49.705
I know you won't.

28:49.749 --> 28:51.664
You brought me back once,

28:51.707 --> 28:53.970
and I believe that you can do it again.

28:58.845 --> 29:00.890
Think we've finally found our Marine.

29:00.934 --> 29:02.805
I'm gonna call NOPD for backup.

29:02.849 --> 29:04.894
No, no, no, no. We can't
go in with the cavalry.

29:04.926 --> 29:06.286
She's armed and she's demonstrated

29:06.287 --> 29:08.246
that she's dangerous. It's protocol.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.329
I don't give a crap about
protocol. If we go in hot,

29:10.372 --> 29:12.172
I'm confident you won't
like how it plays out.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.817
Okay. What's your brilliant idea?

29:19.439 --> 29:21.172
Gregorio.

29:25.088 --> 29:27.395
Private Ortiz?

29:27.439 --> 29:30.572
Please... stay back.

29:30.616 --> 29:33.967
I'm Quentin Carter,
NCIS. I'm here to help.

29:34.010 --> 29:35.838
- I said stay back!
- Okay.

29:35.882 --> 29:37.057
I'm just here to talk.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.624
Not another step.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.016
Okay.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.417
I know you're hurting, Dani.

29:49.461 --> 29:50.853
You don't know anything about me.

29:50.897 --> 29:52.159
You're right.

29:52.203 --> 29:53.639
But your mom does.

29:53.682 --> 29:56.250
My...

29:56.294 --> 29:59.079
You talked to my mother?

29:59.122 --> 30:00.994
That's right.

30:01.037 --> 30:05.041
One Marine to another, she
wants to be there for you.

30:06.869 --> 30:08.871
But you have to let her in.

30:08.915 --> 30:10.917
I can't.

30:12.919 --> 30:16.183
She's strong. I'm nothing like her.

30:16.227 --> 30:18.185
That is your mind playing tricks on you.

30:18.229 --> 30:20.970
It's telling you to quit, but
you can get through this.

30:21.014 --> 30:23.799
What if I can't?

30:23.843 --> 30:26.106
You're in the suck, Marine. Okay?

30:26.149 --> 30:27.455
I've been there.

30:27.499 --> 30:30.197
But you are strong
enough to push through it.

30:30.241 --> 30:31.416
Dani,

30:31.459 --> 30:33.809
your mom is waiting for you,

30:33.853 --> 30:36.072
and she loves you.

30:36.116 --> 30:38.074
I let her down.

30:38.118 --> 30:39.559
- And the Corps.
- No. Hey.

30:39.602 --> 30:40.860
Hey, hey, no.

30:40.903 --> 30:43.384
Only if you pull that trigger.

30:43.428 --> 30:45.299
Okay? But lower the weapon.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.476
Let your mom and the
Marines help you out, okay?

30:48.520 --> 30:50.696
We all got your back.

30:50.739 --> 30:52.828
Dani, look at me.

30:52.872 --> 30:57.485
Nobody wins here
unless you lower the gun.

30:57.529 --> 30:59.574
Okay?

31:00.619 --> 31:02.969
Let us take you home.

31:03.512 --> 31:05.493
You want to go home.

31:06.538 --> 31:08.540
Let us take you home.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.977
You want to go home.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.283
Yeah.

31:16.199 --> 31:19.072
Okay. I got you. I got you.

31:24.251 --> 31:26.297
I got you.

31:26.340 --> 31:29.212
Dwayne, you're in charge of this.

31:30.056 --> 31:34.217
No one you see, nothing
that happens can hurt you.

31:45.577 --> 31:47.927
I got you something.

31:47.970 --> 31:49.537
Yeah.

31:50.582 --> 31:52.366
Now, if I know your mama,

31:52.370 --> 31:53.730
you're probably still playing with

31:53.731 --> 31:54.977
that same little mitt you had

31:55.021 --> 31:56.327
when I went upstate, yeah?

31:58.372 --> 32:01.114
But you're almost 54 inches now, right?

32:01.157 --> 32:03.682
A real player.

32:03.725 --> 32:05.988
You need a full-size glove.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.950
How was your mama while I was upstate?

32:12.734 --> 32:14.736
Good.

32:17.348 --> 32:19.698
Take good care of you?

32:19.741 --> 32:21.308
Sure.

32:21.352 --> 32:23.092
That's good.

32:24.137 --> 32:25.573
Anybody been hanging around?

32:33.364 --> 32:36.018
I asked you a question, son.

32:39.413 --> 32:42.373
We can't run from it anymore.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.899
Need to know what happened.

32:46.942 --> 32:48.901
Hmm?

32:49.945 --> 32:51.469
Red, I guess.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.384
He-he and Mama

32:53.427 --> 32:55.298
been singing and stuff.

32:58.780 --> 33:00.478
Yeah, that's what I heard.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.177
All right. Come on, Dwayne.

33:04.220 --> 33:06.222
Me and you got some
business to take care of.

33:21.324 --> 33:22.413
Daddy, stop!

33:36.731 --> 33:39.299
Protect what's yours, son.

33:53.444 --> 33:55.881
It was all my fault.

33:58.449 --> 34:01.364
It was all my fault.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.174
BP's 110/70.

34:22.417 --> 34:23.579
Back to normal.

34:25.446 --> 34:28.623
Had us worried for a minute.

34:28.667 --> 34:32.148
When I... finally realized
what I was seeing

34:32.192 --> 34:35.456
was a repressed memory, I...

34:35.498 --> 34:38.024
- I panicked myself.
- Mm, but now you know

34:38.067 --> 34:39.982
why you repressed it.

34:40.726 --> 34:43.159
What you witnessed was horrific.

34:43.203 --> 34:45.579
Your mind was too young
to cope with the trauma,

34:45.621 --> 34:47.146
so it locked it all away.

34:47.188 --> 34:50.192
At least I finally know who Red was,

34:50.235 --> 34:52.281
even if I still don't know his name.

34:54.370 --> 34:58.722
My father killed a man who
was important to my mother.

34:58.766 --> 35:02.204
And I'm pretty sure...

35:02.248 --> 35:05.164
Pretty sure she might know who he is.

35:06.774 --> 35:09.698
Even if Mena does remember,

35:09.742 --> 35:12.301
you're not sure you want her to.

35:26.615 --> 35:29.096
I was told you're unpredictable,

35:29.140 --> 35:30.726
but...

35:31.528 --> 35:33.584
a week early to your new post?

35:33.627 --> 35:36.673
Yeah, well, I like to keep
busy, Special Agent Pride.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.501
As do I.

35:39.633 --> 35:40.895
Welcome.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.332
Thank you. Looks like
you had a hell of a day.

35:43.376 --> 35:45.595
I've had better.

35:45.639 --> 35:48.207
I heard you did good
with that young Marine.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.165
Ah, that's what I do.

35:50.209 --> 35:53.603
Figured you might be
here filing the casework.

35:53.647 --> 35:55.954
Yeah, well, I've been to enough postings

35:55.997 --> 35:59.261
to know that the new guy,
he draws that short straw.

35:59.305 --> 36:02.134
Five posts in five years.
Got to be a record.

36:03.439 --> 36:04.876
What's up with that?

36:04.919 --> 36:05.977
You, uh, wanted me here.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.269
I'm sure you got an earful

36:07.313 --> 36:09.271
- from my previous bosses.
- Yeah.

36:09.315 --> 36:12.927
And they all agree,
you're "fast and furious".

36:12.971 --> 36:14.363
Make a splash,

36:14.407 --> 36:16.365
piss off the rank and file,

36:16.409 --> 36:19.368
close some high-profile case.

36:19.412 --> 36:23.807
The highest-profile cases any
of those offices ever handled.

36:24.151 --> 36:26.114
But who's keeping score, right?

36:26.158 --> 36:27.855
I am, Agent Pride.

36:27.899 --> 36:29.378
I am.

36:29.422 --> 36:30.945
I can see that.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.339
Then you request a transfer

36:33.382 --> 36:35.863
before your coworkers can force you out.

36:35.907 --> 36:39.258
Well, you know, I find it easier
on morale if I make my own exit.

36:39.301 --> 36:40.901
And you can save the
"team" speech, okay?

36:40.902 --> 36:43.205
I heard every version of
it already, Agent Pride.

36:43.249 --> 36:44.265
Call me Dwayne.

36:44.267 --> 36:46.614
Probably won't be
doing that, Agent Pride.

36:46.656 --> 36:47.919
I do my own thing,

36:47.962 --> 36:49.181
- my own way.
- Like packing up

36:49.224 --> 36:50.922
Christopher's desk without asking?

36:50.965 --> 36:52.445
No one here was going to.

36:52.488 --> 36:55.274
Look, I'm being real
respectful with his things,

36:55.317 --> 36:58.538
but you can't move forward
if you're staring at the past.

37:01.671 --> 37:04.152
Fair enough.

37:04.196 --> 37:06.198
But you need to stop.

37:14.762 --> 37:17.774
Christopher was more
than just a coworker.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.646
He was family.

37:19.689 --> 37:21.430
I'm sure he was, but just so you know,

37:21.434 --> 37:22.834
I'm not looking for a family, okay?

37:22.835 --> 37:24.303
I got one of my own already.

37:24.346 --> 37:28.263
Anyone who knows the Navy knows
about the Legendary Carters.

37:28.307 --> 37:30.787
Yep. And I'm sure you know
any number of them, okay?

37:30.831 --> 37:32.311
But I am my own man.

37:32.354 --> 37:34.052
Yeah, well, you want to stand out,

37:34.095 --> 37:35.879
you got to break away from the pack.

37:36.924 --> 37:39.318
Yeah, right. Okay.

37:39.361 --> 37:41.885
Look, I don't need a mentor

37:41.929 --> 37:45.672
or a big brother or a father
figure or whatever it is

37:45.715 --> 37:47.355
you think you're offering
by requesting me

37:47.356 --> 37:49.402
to your little family.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.245
I'm just looking to do my job.

37:53.288 --> 37:57.553
And as you now know, damn, I do it well.

38:00.469 --> 38:04.473
Have a nice night, Special Agent.

38:35.548 --> 38:37.767
Roll Tide.

38:50.606 --> 38:52.347
Is that the circle progression?

38:52.391 --> 38:54.349
Yes, it is.

38:54.393 --> 38:58.266
Red taught it to me right here
in this bar a long time ago.

38:58.310 --> 38:59.702
Sit down.

38:59.746 --> 39:02.314
Sounds like a happy memory.

39:02.357 --> 39:04.359
That one was.

39:06.274 --> 39:11.497
And then, a good man died

39:11.540 --> 39:14.195
for a baseball mitt.

39:14.239 --> 39:16.850
Come on, Dwayne.

39:16.893 --> 39:20.419
You were a child. It's not your fault.

39:20.462 --> 39:24.075
You were a child who
tried to please a vicious,

39:24.118 --> 39:27.513
violent father who
could never be pleased.

39:28.688 --> 39:30.690
What if I could've stopped him?

39:30.733 --> 39:33.127
You didn't do anything wrong.

39:33.171 --> 39:37.523
And you must relieve
yourself of this guilt

39:37.566 --> 39:39.307
if you ever hope to move on.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.877
Can't move forward if
you're staring at the past.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.835
That's wise words.

39:45.879 --> 39:48.534
But there's a silver lining to accept.

39:48.577 --> 39:50.318
What happened to Red,

39:50.362 --> 39:53.756
to you as a child, it explains

39:53.800 --> 39:56.150
why you are the man you are.

39:57.543 --> 39:59.110
Wha... What are you talking about?

39:59.153 --> 40:01.982
You couldn't save Red...

40:03.679 --> 40:05.116
...and that's why

40:05.159 --> 40:09.816
you're trying to save everyone else.

40:11.513 --> 40:13.776
But I can't.

40:15.735 --> 40:17.911
Just like I couldn't save Christopher.

40:17.954 --> 40:22.176
Dwayne, you've spent a whole
lifetime beating yourself up

40:22.220 --> 40:26.441
for something you never
could've prevented.

40:27.486 --> 40:29.749
That's got to stop now.

40:29.792 --> 40:32.447
I know I need to,

40:32.491 --> 40:35.972
but it's not a switch you can just flip.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.194
It isn't.

40:40.238 --> 40:43.154
But we expect you to try.

40:49.986 --> 40:52.772
- Thanks for sticking with me, Loretta.
- Oh...

41:02.651 --> 41:03.870
- What?
- Oh...

41:03.913 --> 41:05.611
Sister needs a drink.

41:05.654 --> 41:07.700
Okay.

41:07.743 --> 41:09.745
Thanks.

41:17.492 --> 41:19.059
This one's for you, Red.
