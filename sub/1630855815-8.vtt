WEBVTT

00:10.052 --> 00:11.679
Marie, what happened?

00:17.977 --> 00:18.978
Oh, shit.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.736
You sense things in blood.

00:26.736 --> 00:27.945
<i>Thought I was the only one.</i>

00:27.945 --> 00:29.905
- Holy shit.
- <i>I'm messed up, Emma.</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:31.323
You should be with someone that isn't.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.033
<i>Well, maybe I want to be with you.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.118
Oh, fuck.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.328
Turns out the school is
a fucking Mengele health clinic.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.789
<i>They were using Sam
to augment Luke's powers,</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:40.583
but they were doing
other stuff to him, too.

00:40.583 --> 00:41.667
Shetty was directing it all.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.878
We're estimating about
ten months to make it potent

00:43.878 --> 00:46.172
and contagious enough to get the job done.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.923
What you're describing, it's genocide.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.884
Keep a close eye on her.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.887
Is this all of it? We'll make sure
this stays out of the wrong hands.

00:54.889 --> 00:55.931
This school is a front.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.349
You will not control us!

00:57.349 --> 01:00.686
<i>The school is here to study you.</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:02.188
It's time.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.481
Don't help.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.236
- <i>Fuck.</i>
- <i>Why didn't I fucking help her?</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:12.573
<i>Holy shit, she fucking killed her.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:15.034
<i>She tortured us! She tortured us!</i>

01:15.034 --> 01:16.660
<i>Cate, holy shit!</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:18.662
<i>She killed a guy.
We all killed someone. Oh, my God.</i>

01:18.662 --> 01:19.747
<i>She's fucking crazy.</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:20.998
<i>Can we help her? What?</i>

01:20.998 --> 01:22.166
<i>Why didn't you let me save her?</i>

01:22.166 --> 01:25.002
<i>What the fuck did you do?!</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:32.927
Okay, look, let's all just calm down
a-and assess the situation.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.179
The situation's bleeding
all over the fucking rug.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.807
We just... we have to figure out
what to do now.

01:37.807 --> 01:39.141
You murdered her.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.812
Marie, I did this for you.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.689
I did this for all of you.

01:45.689 --> 01:49.318
When I'm done, maybe eventually
you'll realize I'm being a hero.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.028
I want to be a hero, too.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.532
- Of course, Sam.
- Leave him alone.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.450
Shetty sucked.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.077
I'm not an experiment.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.870
What are you gonna do, Cate?

02:02.581 --> 02:04.291
We are gonna free The Woods.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.126
Sam, don't go with her.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.712
This is about you, too.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.089
If they find out what happened here,

02:10.089 --> 02:12.258
I'm not gonna be
the only one they torture.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.720
Maybe it's time for me to save you.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.979
You can beat me.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.981
But do you really think you can beat him?

02:48.878 --> 02:50.170
Fuck.

02:51.714 --> 02:54.425
- Who are you calling?
- Campus security emergency line.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.345
- Yo.
- Are you crazy? They'll get Sam.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.389
What about all the people in The Woods?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.850
She lets them out, it's gonna be chaos.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.394
- Yeah, but--
- You, too?

03:05.394 --> 03:09.273
Look, this is fucked up, but
Godolkin and Vought are fucked up, too.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.317
So, what, we just sit here?

03:11.317 --> 03:13.235
No.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.195
We stop them.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.436
- Okay, the MRI.
- Yeah, yeah. Hey.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.979
These shadows,

03:48.979 --> 03:51.273
here and here and here,

03:51.273 --> 03:53.067
indicate damage.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.319
We believe every time
your father uses his powers,

03:55.319 --> 03:58.739
something like a micro-tear occurs
in the neural pathways.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.700
An accumulation over years.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.827
Years. O-Okay, so can we, can we reverse

04:03.827 --> 04:06.747
or-or brighten those areas
with, like, some medicine or something?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.874
We'll-- I'll buy whatever it is
that we need.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.501
Brain matter is a finite resource.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.837
Through physical therapy
and the right drug cocktail,

04:13.837 --> 04:15.631
we can mitigate or slow.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.299
Not reverse.

04:18.717 --> 04:22.596
Have you experienced any lightheadedness
or spots in your peripheral vision?

04:24.014 --> 04:25.432
Uh, me?

04:25.432 --> 04:29.812
Maybe an uncontrollable tic in the ring
or pinky finger of your left hand?

04:29.812 --> 04:31.021
No. No.

04:31.021 --> 04:35.109
I-I mean, m-maybe-maybe
lightheadedness, but...

04:35.109 --> 04:38.070
but doesn't-doesn't everybody
get lightheaded sometimes?

04:41.073 --> 04:42.992
Can we, can we focus on my dad?

04:42.992 --> 04:45.744
I-I mean, I just--
S-Sorry, it's just a lot. I just--

04:45.744 --> 04:48.789
Our recommendation is physical therapy,

04:48.789 --> 04:52.376
figuring out the right
anti-seizure medicine.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.670
And no more using powers.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.733
What, they didn't have
any king-size hospital beds?

05:17.735 --> 05:19.069
How am I looking?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.030
Like you're made of steel.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.118
Go through my phone.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.203
The contacts for Heather are in there.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.414
Heather... Heather PR or wardrobe?

05:30.414 --> 05:32.249
Wardrobe.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.293
We got to get the costume resized.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.128
The doctor.
I'll get the doctor.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.172
So the Polarity costume fits you.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.634
I'm sorry.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.387
For...

05:47.765 --> 05:49.266
...everything.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.188
I knew about The Woods.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.940
I played along.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.611
I stayed quiet.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.697
To protect you.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.411
But school's done now, kid.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.623
It's your time.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.001
Dad.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.045
Our powers,

06:18.045 --> 06:20.714
- they're killing--
- You're the big man now.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.467
You follow the straight and narrow.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.638
Do whatever they tell you.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.059
No one gets through life without regrets.

06:32.059 --> 06:36.438
But goddamn I don't regret
being able to take care of my family.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.817
And I know you're gonna do the same.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.693
You have to.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.697
Your family's counting on you.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.163
<i>I'm missing
a farm to table fuckfest</i>

06:53.163 --> 06:55.374
<i>at Ina and Jeffrey's
to be at this board meeting,</i>

06:55.374 --> 06:57.668
<i>but someone has to save
this fucking place.</i>

06:57.668 --> 06:59.211
All right, I don't know
where the fuck Indira is,

06:59.211 --> 07:00.379
so let's just start this fucking meeting.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.339
Golden Boy is fertilizing the lawn.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.757
Application rates are down.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.759
Neuman's town hall was a shit show.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.344
We need a big fucking distraction.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.721
Let's send someone straight to The Seven.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.224
Let's just go in order.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.185
fucking terrible.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.813
surprisingly good.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.190
Additional skills: British accent?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.068
All right, who is pushing for this kid?

07:24.528 --> 07:26.488
- Anyone?
- Focus tests show him in the lead

07:26.488 --> 07:28.073
with the 12 to 18 demo.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.576
They think he seems like,
quote, "a real one."

07:30.576 --> 07:33.871
His on-screen skin color tests
read a bit dark.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.665
Then we'll get Annie fucking Leibovitz
to shoot him, you racist shit.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.585
- Polarity brand is consistent, though.
- All right, we will come back to him.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.129
Who's next?
And seriously, where the fuck is Indira?

08:00.606 --> 08:01.815
Cate?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.609
I haven't seen you down here in a while.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.735
Greg.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.320
Uh, I'm Bob.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.530
Oh, God. No, no!

08:28.884 --> 08:31.470
- Unlock the cells.
- Okay.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.662
When's the last time you saw sunlight?

08:57.746 --> 09:00.207
Is "Gangnam Style" still a thing?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.584
Let's go outside.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.697
Hey, Sam.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.744
Luke.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.538
What you doing?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.333
Helping supes.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.043
Hurting humans?

09:45.043 --> 09:46.461
Same thing.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.672
That's what you wanted.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.215
Nah, man.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.011
I hurt one person once.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.762
Then I killed myself from guilt.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.560
And what about your tiny friend Emma?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.603
She's not here.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.566
Yeah, and neither are you.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.777
You killed yourself.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.114
Leaving me in this cell!

10:14.114 --> 10:18.160
Sam, I know you don't want to do this.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.166
Sam. Sam.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.792
Sam!

10:47.689 --> 10:49.358
Who is that?

10:51.026 --> 10:53.528
That was Andy.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.281
He was hilarious.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.826
And then really sad.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.787
He was bipolar.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.663
They got him sick on purpose?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.707
This is what they do.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.633
This school

11:14.633 --> 11:16.968
thought they could torture you.

11:16.968 --> 11:20.389
Why? Because they said you were all crazy?

11:20.389 --> 11:21.973
Inferior?

11:21.973 --> 11:24.393
But you're not inferior.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.980
You are superior to them.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.859
And it's time we showed it.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.701
Eat your own fucking hands, you monster.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.067
Jordan, you sweep the student union.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.819

As all you Jeffsters can see,

13:07.954 --> 13:11.041
no crutches, no cast,
leg's finally healed.

<i>Ever since Translucent died,</i>

14:05.720 --> 14:08.932
there's been a gaping empty hole

Maverick.

than Translucent's son?

- ...as his father,
then we just can't do this.

- What is it?

- Uh, there's an issue on campus.
- What?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.742
Stay right there.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.746
I'm just waiting for
a couple more people to hop on.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.916
Holy fucking shit.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.836
Harper, are you watching this?

14:42.549 --> 14:43.967
Eat it.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.725
Now.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.276
Oh, my God.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.696
Where the fuck is Shetty?!

15:12.704 --> 15:16.458
This country was founded
on a single truth:

15:16.458 --> 15:19.252
All men and women were created equal.

15:19.252 --> 15:23.715
If this is going to be
the dawn of The Seven,

15:23.715 --> 15:26.092
we have to first...

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
...get through dusk.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.316
No, no, just me.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.946
Now, that right there

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
is how you fucking audition.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.909
Don't touch my knuckles.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.370
That's how you choose a monologue

15:53.370 --> 15:56.456
to compliment your director
without explicitly saying,

15:56.456 --> 15:57.624
"Hey, I love you.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.876
I'm a needy little shit.
Please give me the job."

15:59.876 --> 16:01.419
No, you do it through the work.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.672
You play it on the fucking line.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.674
I'm sorry, can I help you?

16:07.550 --> 16:08.968
Kid, we're having a breakthrough here.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.221
Look, if you're here to audit the class,
just have a seat.

16:13.932 --> 16:17.519
Okay, remember when I talked about
stage presence, everybody?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.354
That is not it.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.564
Josh Hartnett has more stage presence
than this man here.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.775
And I can say that because
we are close personal--

16:23.775 --> 16:25.944
I was kidding.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.240
Sam, stop!

16:38.415 --> 16:40.375
What are you thinking?

16:40.375 --> 16:41.793
Why are you here?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.128
Because you're here.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.879
- So, what?
- So...

16:44.879 --> 16:46.965
We...

16:46.965 --> 16:49.843
We share things, our...

16:49.843 --> 16:51.261
our feelings, our privates,

16:51.261 --> 16:52.721
and now you're just
throwing all that away?

16:52.721 --> 16:53.888
No, no.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.432
Emma, it's my choice.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.891
Yeah, but, Sam,
you don't want to hurt people.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.935
People hurt me!

17:00.770 --> 17:03.231
Yeah, I didn't ask for you
to rescue me, Emma.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.691
You did that for you.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.277
And you never asked what do I want.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.780
You just came in, and,
"Fucking Sam, do this."

17:10.780 --> 17:12.657
"Sam, don't kill people."

17:12.657 --> 17:15.160
- Okay, that's pretty normal.
That's not weird--
- I'm normal, Emma!

17:15.160 --> 17:19.080
This is what normal looks like
when you've had my fucking life!

17:19.080 --> 17:21.875
You know, while you were worrying about,

17:21.875 --> 17:24.753
oh, maybe starring in a reality TV show,

17:24.753 --> 17:28.423
I was having a needle
shoved in my fucking spine.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.301
Okay, that is not what I meant! No!

17:34.721 --> 17:37.599
Sam, I want what's best,
and you know that.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.685
You want what is best...

17:42.437 --> 17:43.605
...for you.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.655
I risked everything for you.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.244
Emma, you would do anything

17:58.244 --> 18:01.164
for everyone to like you.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.293
You're not a hero.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.214
I know you don't mean that.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.174
You don't mean...

18:29.859 --> 18:31.903
What the fuck?

18:40.328 --> 18:42.455
What the fuck?

18:50.088 --> 18:51.798
- You don't even know.
- <i>Don't be mad.</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:53.925
I freed The Woods. Shetty's dead.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.886
How...? What did you do, Cate?

18:56.886 --> 18:58.137
It's not too late.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.514
<i>Come be with me.</i>

18:59.514 --> 19:01.516
<i>I love you.</i>

19:01.516 --> 19:02.892
We can be together.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.150
What are you doing?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.152
You're not real, you're not real,
you're not real.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.322
- Hey, is Emma the only girl
that ever let you bust a nut?
- No. No.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.782
I mean inside of her.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.910
Sam. What's happening?

19:20.910 --> 19:22.078
Is this right?

19:22.078 --> 19:24.497
- Holding humans accountable?
- Killing innocent people.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.416
Aren't some of
these people innocent?

19:26.416 --> 19:28.459
What we're doing is so hard.

19:29.544 --> 19:33.089
- Do you want my help?
- Sam, listen to me.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.133
Who's actually you, imagining me.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.052
This is it. This is your fucking moment.

19:38.052 --> 19:41.806
You are not defined
by what's happened to you.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.350
You are what you do.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.312
- Yeah?
-"Yeah" you want my help?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.314
Right now.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.441
Be a hero. Stop Cate.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.692
Sam?

19:54.903 --> 19:56.571
Sam, what's happening?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.242
I love you.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.786
But you said you were me.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.582
And trust me...

20:09.584 --> 20:11.419
...I hate myself.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.755
Sam, do you want my help?

20:15.590 --> 20:17.175
No.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.344
Yeah.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.638
Okay, help me.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.099
You fucking crazy fuck.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.603
Feel nothing.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.489
I feel so empty.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.451
It feels good.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.147
<i>Guys, guys,</i>

21:13.147 --> 21:16.150
<i>these big-ass doors
just locked me in my dorm room!</i>

21:16.150 --> 21:18.027
There's some maniac loose on campus.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.293
Oh, my God.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.379
- Open the fucking door!
- Who the fuck is that?

21:36.379 --> 21:37.880
I can hear you, Ashley.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.509
Now, you open this door or I swear to God
I'm gonna tell everyone what you and I did

21:41.509 --> 21:43.970
in the bathroom
at the pediatric cancer fundraiser!

21:43.970 --> 21:45.847
All right, open, open,
open, open, open, open.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.265
I'm gonna tell them what you did!

21:47.265 --> 21:48.599
All right, we're opening the door!

21:48.599 --> 21:50.184
Stop fucking talking, my God.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.686
Holy shit, Ash.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.062
I prayed the fucking Shema.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.689
I swear to God I thought I was gonna die.

21:54.689 --> 21:57.108
Calm down. Just breathe. Shake it out.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.359
Everything's fine. Look.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.361
Someone turned on the sonic whistle.
We're good.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.487
Holy fuck.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.875
Oh, fuck no.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.044
Fuck, please.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.638
What the fuck? Don't just stand there.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.348
Block the fucking door.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.894
Find fucking Homelander.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.479
Radio the helicopter now. Go.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.898
All right, everyone, grab one
and make a call right now.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.192
Whoever kills these rogue supes
gets in The Seven.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.529
Hello?

22:43.529 --> 22:45.406
<i>Marie Moreau? Ashley Barrett.</i>

22:45.406 --> 22:47.784
Vought.
We are considering you for The Seven.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.577
Congratulations. We're so excited.

22:49.577 --> 22:53.039
<i>We just need you to take out
some, uh, escaped, um,</i>

22:53.039 --> 22:54.248
students.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.958
Cancel them.
Cancel them from planet Earth.

22:55.958 --> 22:59.796
Oh, Miss Barrett,
thanks, but...

22:59.796 --> 23:03.382
<i>Jesus fucking Christ, Marie,
the entire board of trustees is up here.</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:06.135
You do this, and I will get you
a meeting with your sister.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.221
<i>Get--</i>

23:09.472 --> 23:11.516
Oh, my God.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.059
I just lost Wi-Fi.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.727
There's no signal.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.521
LTE?

23:16.521 --> 23:18.564
No. No, nothing.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.358
Harper!

23:20.358 --> 23:22.360
Who's gonna know if we die?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.736
What the fuck?!

23:29.784 --> 23:31.452
- Oh, hey, hey, hey!
- Hey! Hey!

23:31.452 --> 23:33.079
Hey, we're here! Come on!

23:35.957 --> 23:38.084
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.502
Cate, stop!

24:05.987 --> 24:07.947
I'm gonna go stop Cate.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.783
No, I'll talk to her.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.994
I mean...

24:12.994 --> 24:14.453
Guardians of Godolkin.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.164
We do this together.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.790
Am I right?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.042
Let's go.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.672
Hey, Cate.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.591
Jesus, Cate.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.009
How are you pushing so much?

24:28.009 --> 24:30.094
Shetty's medication.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.888
I thought she was helping me.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.265
She was limiting me.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.683
Cate, you have to stop this.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.518
They want me to kill you.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.812
- Is that what you're gonna do?
- No.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.147
Of course not.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.982
Cate, shit.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.526
- I got this call from Vought about kill--
- Stop her.

24:45.526 --> 24:46.611
You got it.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.323
Oh, shit.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.908
- Okay, bro. Bro?
- Maverick?

24:51.908 --> 24:53.618
We're on the same side, Cate.

24:53.618 --> 24:55.703
Do you really want to be like your dad?

25:00.791 --> 25:02.084
Stop her.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.462
I got this.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.713
Cate?

25:09.717 --> 25:11.677
Maverick.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.554
Just hold on.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.306
Can't you, like,

25:15.306 --> 25:18.017
find the real you or something?

25:19.810 --> 25:22.104
Like, dig deep or whatever?

25:24.690 --> 25:25.691
Let go!

25:45.002 --> 25:47.255
Okay, asshole!

26:16.534 --> 26:18.411
What the fuck?

26:20.705 --> 26:22.581
We need to get everybody
back inside right now.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.256
What the fuck is he doing?!
Holy--

26:30.256 --> 26:32.133
- Get to the helicopter.
- No, it's fucking grounded!

26:32.133 --> 26:34.593
- It's fucking enclosed. Get in.
Do you want to stay here?
- No!

26:34.593 --> 26:35.928
Go!

26:35.928 --> 26:37.179
Go, go.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.223
Go, go, go!

26:39.223 --> 26:40.433
Hurry, hurry!

26:40.433 --> 26:43.311
Cate? Cate? Hey, hey, hey.

26:44.395 --> 26:47.273
- What side are you on, Andre?
- Whatever side gets us out of this shit.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.275
Yeah, that's your real superpower,
isn't it?

26:49.275 --> 26:52.028
Acting like you're doing something
when really you're doing nothing.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.238
Cate, whenever either one of us
does something on their own,

26:54.238 --> 26:55.906
shit gets screwed up big-time.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.826
But I know we do
some amazing shit together.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.954
Whatever's happening right now,
let's just, let's just figure it out.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.205
Both of us.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.543
Please.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.426
Yeah.

27:15.426 --> 27:16.886
Okay.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.646
Okay.

27:30.941 --> 27:31.942
Cate!

27:32.860 --> 27:34.779
Dude, stop. We loved Luke.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.578
He was like my brother.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.322
You're right. Okay?

28:18.322 --> 28:21.575
I agree. Fuck Shetty. Fuck our parents.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.494
Marie, they asked you to kill me.

28:23.494 --> 28:26.080
So if you don't, what's gonna happen?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.374
They'll still try to kill you.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.042
And they'll try to destroy me.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.585
Then what choice do we have?

28:31.585 --> 28:33.462
I don't know.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.173
I just wanted to be a hero.

28:36.173 --> 28:41.262
Someone my sister could be proud of,
but I don't give a shit anymore.

28:41.262 --> 28:42.805
I just want to be a good person.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.517
But, Marie, you're not a person.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.394
You're a product to them.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.187
A freak.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.648
I'm trying to save you.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.028
Fuck.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.448
And fuck you.

29:04.785 --> 29:05.995
My heart.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.629
Get us the fuck out of here!

29:15.629 --> 29:16.797
The helicopter!

29:42.865 --> 29:44.366
Fucking Christ!

29:44.366 --> 29:46.285
I'm putting that in my next movie!

30:02.551 --> 30:05.930
See? We're good together.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.232
No.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.522
Sir, I, uh...

31:06.532 --> 31:10.327
What... kind of animal are you?

31:14.331 --> 31:15.499
What?

31:16.584 --> 31:19.461
Do you like attacking your own kind?

31:19.461 --> 31:22.131
No, I, um...

31:23.924 --> 31:25.634
Stay back.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.228
<i>It's happened yet again in America.</i>

31:36.228 --> 31:38.314
<i>Tragedy on campus.</i>

31:38.314 --> 31:41.191
