WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.510
[crickets chirping]

00:12.137 --> 00:16.558
Oh, my God!
Is that Carl's heart? Did you kill Carl?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.644
-I don't know. Maybe?
-How could you not know?

00:20.270 --> 00:21.771
I saw him in the parking lot

00:21.855 --> 00:24.649
and he was yelling at me
and then I woke up here.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.526
It must be some kind of a blackout.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.904
-You have no memory of what happened?
-No. Nothing.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.073
Okay. Maybe that's not a human heart.

00:32.157 --> 00:36.327
Maybe that's an animal heart.
That would be so great and totally legal.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.374
Definitely human.
Fresh from the chest.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.002
This sucks! This really sucks!

00:44.085 --> 00:46.504
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at the situation.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.342
Where did you put the body?

00:52.510 --> 00:54.304
"Situation"?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.598
"The situation" doesn't remember.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.601
Come on, let's get you inside
and figure out what to do.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.148
-Where's my other boot?
-I don't know.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.942
Is there even the slightest chance
you traded it for a human heart?

01:18.828 --> 01:21.998
Carl's not here, just some leftover Nazis
and a chunk of Serb.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.250
Gary said you didn't go
to the other unit either.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.629
Then he told me a story
about meeting Paul Shaffer at a car wash.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.172
It was actually pretty funny.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.258
-Honey.
-Yeah, it can wait. [giggles]

01:33.009 --> 01:34.594
He had this super tiny cat with him.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.598
Remind me later.
All right, it's almost morning.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.684
We'll go to the office like normal.
If Carl shows up, great.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.020
If we hear that he's dead,
we'll act surprised.

01:44.103 --> 01:47.190
-Oh, God, that's crazy.
-You have a better idea?

01:47.273 --> 01:49.943
-No, that was me acting surprised.
-No way. Seriously?

01:50.026 --> 01:52.821
-Yeah. Pretty good, right?
-That was me acting surprised.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.948
Oh, nice. We got this.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.285
<i>Hey, it's Carl Coby.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:02.205
<i>Pat, what do I press</i>
<i>when I'm done? Pat!</i>

02:02.288 --> 02:05.583
Hey, it's Sheila.
I felt bad I missed the meeting,

02:05.667 --> 02:09.045
so I wanted to leave you a recording
of where I was yesterday.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.965
I addressed a problem with my daughter
from 2:00 to 5:00,

02:12.048 --> 02:14.509
had dinner with my husband
from 5:00 to 7:00,

02:14.592 --> 02:17.303
then went to bed
where I stayed until morning.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.389
I hope you're well. Love you.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.017
Yeah, I'm not looking forward
to hearing that at the trial.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.103
He's not here
and Pat hasn't heard from him.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.813
Plus, he missed his first meeting
this morning.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.148
Oh, God, I killed him.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.692
After he yelled at you yesterday,
you must've snapped,

02:30.775 --> 02:34.028
brought him to another location,
attacked him, and ripped out his heart.

02:34.279 --> 02:38.700
Oh, fuck! I didn't even get to enjoy it.
Just straight to consequences.

02:38.783 --> 02:42.704
It's like pushing cake all the way down
your throat, right to your thighs.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.165
This is the second coworker we've killed.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.459
-When they find Carl's body--
-That's it. I'm going to prison.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.380
I'm so sorry, honey.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.592
We're not giving up.
You're not going to prison.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.968
I love you.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.097
-I'm gonna miss you so much.
-Don't talk like that.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.434
Promise me you'll find
that clam distributor

03:04.517 --> 03:07.145
and figure out what caused this
so it won't happen to anyone else.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.063
I will. No, <i>we</i> will.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.318
And when Abby gets married,
there should be peach roses everywhere.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.945
She'll say it's too much,
but don't listen to her.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.363
God damn it!

03:20.491 --> 03:21.993
You didn't kill Carl.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.621
-I didn't kill Carl.
-Hotcha!

03:26.414 --> 03:28.166
Wait. Then who did you kill?

03:28.249 --> 03:31.336
Some random person!
That's still not great.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.839
Sheila, what the fuck
happened to you yesterday?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.674
-Hey, Joel.
-Carl.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.969
I see you in the parking lot,
and then you just drive away?

03:40.053 --> 03:43.223
I mean, I couldn't pitch
your bullshit eco-homes to the investor.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.975
I had to pull a "Mad Men"
and take him to a strip club all night.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.772
But isn't it great that you're
healthy enough to enjoy the female form?

03:50.855 --> 03:53.399
All you had to do was show up
and not be a know-it-all.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.901
You couldn't even do that.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.362
I'm sorry, Carl.

03:57.445 --> 04:01.449
But you know what?
The last few days have been impossible.

04:01.532 --> 04:05.286
You want me to be your meek yes-woman,
but that's not who I am anymore.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.914
I have opinions,
and that's a good thing,

04:07.997 --> 04:11.209
because a workplace is stronger
when everybody has a voice.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.213
Yeah, that sounds like a pain in the ass.
You're fired.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.258
What? You're firing us?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.677
No, just you. Joel can stay.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.095
Uhh...

04:22.262 --> 04:24.806
I rescheduled the meeting
with the investor for 5:00 tonight.

04:24.889 --> 04:25.765
Can you make it?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.267
Uhh...

04:27.934 --> 04:28.768
Great.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.774
He's alive.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.570
Carl took me by surprise.
I didn't know what to say!

04:39.654 --> 04:43.825
How about, "Sheila and I are a team, Carl.
We've always been a team.

04:43.908 --> 04:47.412
And I would sooner slit my throat
than betray my goddess wife."

04:47.495 --> 04:51.791
He cut me off. I would've gotten there.
So, any thoughts on who you <i>did</i> kill?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.001
Uh...

04:54.210 --> 04:55.878
Are you thinking about it
or just doing me?

04:55.962 --> 04:56.963
Uh...

04:57.255 --> 04:59.007
Oh, I get it. Is this gonna be a thing?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.675
Uh...

05:01.634 --> 05:03.052
[pounding on door]

05:05.013 --> 05:08.099
Oh, my God. It could be the police!
I'm going to jail.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.561
We'll fight this, sweetheart.
It's a disease. It wasn't your fault.

05:11.644 --> 05:15.315
Don't you dare spend a penny
of Abby's college fund on my legal team.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.441
[Lisa] It's Lisa!

05:16.524 --> 05:17.984
Oh, thank God.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.528
[Lisa] I know you're home.
Pull out, pull out, wherever you are.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.612
[quietly] Wow.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.910
Thank you, Sheila!

05:28.286 --> 05:29.287
You're welcome?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.583
I thought about what you told me
last night, and I'm gonna do it!

05:34.459 --> 05:35.877
Hooray?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.879
Do you guys have any milk?
I can't keep any in the house.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.839
Eric goes through like a gallon a day.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.884
-What did you tell her?
-I don't know!

05:42.967 --> 05:47.013
-Your guess is as good as mine.
-I don't think so, honey. You were there.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.810
-Did you tell Joel yet?
-Not yet.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.479
Well, tell him.

05:57.565 --> 06:01.819
Well, Lisa... here...

06:02.820 --> 06:04.781
Oh, my God, I will tell him.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.492
As you know, Anne is very religious.

06:07.575 --> 06:11.454
Without going into too much detail,
she refuses to get her tongue pierced

06:11.537 --> 06:13.706
and go down on me
until I accept Jesus as my Savior.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.249
Thank you for keeping it vague.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.419
So, last night
when Anne and I ran into Sheila,

06:18.503 --> 06:22.548
she gave me the push that I needed,
and I decided to get baptized!

06:23.800 --> 06:27.386
I convinced Lisa to get adult baptized.
That's a thing I did.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.930
-Morning, elders.
-Hi, honey.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.934
Abba-dabs!
So, where did you all meet up, Lisa?

06:33.017 --> 06:36.813
And at what time,
and what else did you discuss?

06:36.896 --> 06:39.857
I grew up without sisters,
so I love hearing what women talk about

06:39.941 --> 06:42.026
when there are no men around.
Were men around?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.612
Oh, Sheila was just out front,
going to her car,

06:44.695 --> 06:47.323
and, God, you were on fire.

06:47.406 --> 06:50.201
You were like, "Get baptized!
Live your truth!

06:50.284 --> 06:52.036
Every body is a bikini body!"

06:52.120 --> 06:53.871
Oh, and you really helped Anne.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.623
Well, tell Joel what I did.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.126
-Because he is loving this.
-I am.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.671
Anne's been fixated
on these missing people in Santa Clarita.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.257
Your wife was all,
"Stop thinking about work

07:04.340 --> 07:07.552
and use the creative side
of your fucking brain."

07:07.635 --> 07:09.011
And then she slapped her ass.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.306
Sometimes I do that to make a point.
Right, honey?

07:13.516 --> 07:16.060
It's new and I love it.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.604
Well, it got the message across.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.898
Anne marched straight to my garage,
set up her easel,

07:20.982 --> 07:22.400
and she has been painting ever since.

07:22.483 --> 07:26.362
I got Anne off her crazy investigating
and into painting.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.614
-Good for me, right?
-Good for you.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.450
Yeah, you deserved that lobster.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.492
[both] Hm?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.830
You said something about getting
your dinner out of a lobster tank.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.331
[both] Hm...

07:39.417 --> 07:40.460
Oh, God damn it!

07:41.711 --> 07:43.379
We're out of frozen strawberries.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.883
-I just bought some.
-No, Dad. Come look.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.260
The lack of strawberries is appalling.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.185
Nope. No strawberries.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.396
Just your leftover lobster
from last night.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.774
[Lisa] Ooh, I make
a mean lobster scramble.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.568
No! I don't mean to be rude,

08:05.651 --> 08:09.238
but you told me all these things
I already know because I was there.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.949
So if you don't mind,
I gotta start my day.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.119
Look at this attitude.
You gonna slap my ass?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.579
Come on, slap it. Come on.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.790
Hey, your mom is so fierce,

08:19.874 --> 08:22.835
especially in those red boots
you were wearing last night.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.506
I mean, Anne is obsessed with them.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.966
Would you hate it
if I got her exactly the same ones?

08:29.050 --> 08:32.845
Not at all. But they don't sell them
in my kitchen, so...

08:33.721 --> 08:36.724
Lisa, I'll walk with you.
I have to talk to Eric anyway.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.311
You two spend so much time together.
When are you gonna date?

08:40.394 --> 08:41.395
We're just friends.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.941
You know, Eric's too shy to tell you,
but he has a lovely you-know-what.

08:45.024 --> 08:49.028
When he was born, all the nurses said
it was impressive, but not ostentatious.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.030
These are Professional nurses, talking like that?

08:53.241 --> 08:56.327
It's Boone's Nazi friend.
The one who sold us raffle tickets.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.080
I guess even in a blackout,
I knew not to kill Carl,

08:59.163 --> 09:00.581
so I rage-killed a Nazi.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.916
Why'd you bring him here?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.919
I must've remembered
the storage unit freezer was full.

09:05.002 --> 09:08.506
Pretty smart gal, that blackout Sheila.
I wonder where she gets it.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.966
He's wearing his work uniform.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.553
Maybe you killed him
at "NMS Impound & Tow."

09:13.636 --> 09:15.805
Oh, my God.
Maybe that's where I left my boot.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.433
The one Sheriff Anne is obsessed with,
and if she sees at a bloody crime scene,

09:19.517 --> 09:20.893
she'll immediately connect to you?

09:20.977 --> 09:25.314
"Yes, that one," she answers
with a less judgmental tone in her voice.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.150
We need to get to that impound yard.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.944
There could be witnesses,
other body parts.

09:30.027 --> 09:33.322
You could've slapped bloody handprints
on who knows how many dead asses.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.741
Oh, my God, witnesses!
I remember something.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.742
What?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.537
There was a tall man in a red shirt
waving at me.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.038
Let's go.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.546
-Hey.
-Abby, hi.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.840
Is your dad checking out
that Japopo's clam distributor

09:50.923 --> 09:51.799
we found yesterday?

09:51.882 --> 09:53.301
No, he got distracted.

09:53.384 --> 09:56.345
There's a dead guy in our freezer,
and they don't know how he got there.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.888
But I've ruled out suicide.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.641
I once found my mom's vibrator
in the vegetable crisper.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.559
Ooh.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.354
Okay, here are the ideas I worked up
for the fracking billboard.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.440
So, vandalism
doesn't come naturally to me,

10:07.523 --> 10:10.443
but two Mountain Dews,
and the beast is off its leash!

10:10.526 --> 10:13.237
-Sugar-high Eric! Drink that go-go juice.
-Yeah!

10:13.321 --> 10:15.406
But seriously, if I try to have more,
do not let me.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.407
-Okay.
-All right.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.534
This is what the fracking site
looks like now.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.828
Ugh. "Energy that turns on your future."

10:21.037 --> 10:24.206
And this is what it will look like
tonight, after we paint it.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.501
"Energy that turns off your future."

10:27.585 --> 10:28.878
Asterisk...

10:29.587 --> 10:31.631
[Abby] "By polluting the water table
with carcinogens."

10:32.048 --> 10:34.008
And then a really long URL.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.552
Booyah. Citing my sources.
The beast strikes again.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.221
Okay. Building on that,

10:39.305 --> 10:42.183
what if, instead,
we just write "Fracking Kills"

10:42.266 --> 10:45.019
and then make it look like
blood's coming out of the family's eyes?

10:45.102 --> 10:48.022
That's so much better.
Two beasts in the junkyard. Watch out.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.858
Okay, paint the sign tonight,
film it with a drone tomorrow,

10:50.941 --> 10:51.942
and post it on YouTube.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.570
People see what's in their own
backyard and the opposition begins.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.989
-Yeah!
-Fuck yeah! Wanna go halvsies on a Dew?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.240
-No.
-Good idea.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.242
Okay, are you sure you can get a drone?

11:00.326 --> 11:03.245
Uh, yeah, I won a Parrot AR
off Fenton Hoffstadter

11:03.329 --> 11:05.623
in an all-or-nothing game
of Magic: The Gathering.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.833
Okay. Bunch of words
I'm not super familiar with.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.544
I beat a boy at a game
and now he's giving me his toy.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.464
Great! I was thinking
it would be super helpful

11:13.547 --> 11:15.841
if we had your stepdad's
night vision goggles tonight.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.344
It would,
but after your dad killed him,

11:18.427 --> 11:20.679
my mom locked up
all of Dan's psycho cop stuff

11:20.763 --> 11:23.432
and won't let me anywhere near it.
For no good reason.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.434
Uh-huh. What's the reason?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.104
I got busted
using the goggles to observe an owl.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.147
It was perched above
the Andersons' bedroom window.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.732
They thought
I was watching them have sex.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.318
As if their unremarkable human forms
could hold a candle

11:34.402 --> 11:36.362
to the feathered glory
of a Western Screech Owl.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.324
Well, your mom loves me.
I'll ask for the goggles.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.076
Oh, excellent.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.621
-Pick you up at 8:00?
-Yeah. Are you gonna eat before?

11:45.704 --> 11:49.125
I'll be too nervous.
I thought maybe we could go out after.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.877
Yeah, that would be great.
This is exciting!

11:51.961 --> 11:55.423
Yes, totally. Well, till tonight.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.174
-Oh!
-Oh!

11:58.717 --> 11:59.927
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.521
Lisa?

12:10.604 --> 12:11.856
Oh, Abby. Hey.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.568
I was just reading the Bible,
getting up to speed for my baptism.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.194
-Have you read this?
-No.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.572
-Damn.
-I was just on my way out.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.450
-While I'm here, can I ask you a favor?
-Of course.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.368
You know, as Jesus says...

12:25.786 --> 12:27.997
Oh, fuck, I'll never be able to fake this.
What's up?

12:28.080 --> 12:31.417
Eric mentioned that Dan had
some night vision goggles lying around.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.335
I was just wondering
if I could borrow them.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.963
-It's for a school project.
-On what?

12:36.338 --> 12:39.717
On nighttime.
What happens at night, anyway?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.261
-I'm gonna find out.
-Is this for Eric to look at owls?

12:42.344 --> 12:44.638
Because I can't have Neal Anderson
storming over again

12:44.722 --> 12:45.806
yelling at me about parenting

12:45.890 --> 12:48.017
while standing there in sweatpants
with half an erection.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.438
All right. It's for me and Eric.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.524
We kinda have this special thing
planned in the desert tonight.

12:55.941 --> 12:56.859
Oh, my God.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.945
Are you going on a date?
Tell me you are.

13:01.739 --> 13:05.326
Yes. We're going on a date.
It's finally happening.

13:05.409 --> 13:09.788
This is incredible! You pray <i>one</i> time.
Let me get those for you.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.210
You know, when Dan disappeared,
I locked up all of his crazy shit.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.129
Wait. You're suspended today, right?

13:17.421 --> 13:18.839
Yeah. Why?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.133
I'm making you up.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.760
No, thank you.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.595
If you want the goggles...

13:26.430 --> 13:27.932
-Fine.
-Yay!

13:29.016 --> 13:30.226
[weakly] Yay.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.529
Is that the tall man in a red shirt
who was waving at you?

13:42.613 --> 13:45.950
Yeah. Now that I think about it,
he was incredibly limber.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.326
There's no police tape.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.286
[Sheila] Well, we should check inside
and see

13:49.370 --> 13:51.622
if I strung up anyone's entrails
like Christmas lights.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.543
I've been dreaming about that lately.
I think I'm excited for the holidays.

13:57.586 --> 14:00.923
Hang on. We don't want anyone to see us.
We should wait for them to leave.

14:01.507 --> 14:06.053
Yeah, although they are teenage girls,
so I'm sure we're invisible to them.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.726
Okay, I'll admit it.
Carl and I were not a great match.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.687
It's good I won't be
working with him anymore.

14:15.104 --> 14:19.066
Thank you.
I'm glad you are able to accept--

14:19.149 --> 14:21.402
So I was thinking we could work
somewhere else.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.445
There's an opening
at Principal Residential.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.905
Chris and Christa's company?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.324
The woman threatened to fuck us
with a strap-on!

14:27.408 --> 14:28.784
Well, don't be sexist, Joel.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.538
If Elon Musk threatened to fuck us
with a strap-on, you'd call it leadership.

14:32.621 --> 14:33.706
I don't think I would.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.250
Fine. There are other companies
we could work with.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.752
All of them with bosses
who you might not like.

14:39.712 --> 14:44.383
So what, you're just gonna keep
working for Carl without me?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.929
All I'm saying is we can't afford
to both be out of a job.

14:56.103 --> 14:56.937
[girl] Whoo!

14:57.855 --> 14:58.772
They're leaving.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.693
[gasps] Did they break it?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.654
Fucking teenagers!
We should report them.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.823
Absolutely.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.825
Right after we check on my murder.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.920
I don't see any blood
or junk body parts.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.382
There's no one in the office
or on the office walls.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.718
Shit! Is that a camera?

15:31.472 --> 15:32.890
Shit! It is!

15:37.227 --> 15:38.812
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.357
-This doesn't look like human behavior.
-No.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.609
If there's a camera...

15:43.692 --> 15:46.403
Then there could be a recording
of me eating a man alive.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.573
And that really won't look
like human behavior.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.332
[Lisa] You've been so good for Eric.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.918
Before you,
the only girl he talked to was his cousin.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.755
That was headed in a weird direction.
She's super pushy.

16:07.341 --> 16:11.470
Eric's good for me, too.
I can really depend on him, you know?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.514
It feels like my face is suffocating.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.767
I'm just giving you a little war paint
to match your personality.

16:16.850 --> 16:20.104
Eric told me what you did
to defend that poor girl in the cafeteria.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.731
-Oh, it wasn't a big deal.
-Well, I think it was.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.900
I've been watching you
over the past couple weeks,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.695
and you have a fire in you
that you didn't have before.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.364
You're a doer, a woman of action.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.699
Thanks, Lisa.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.201
My life's been kind of intense lately.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.495
I guess that made me think
more about what's important.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.123
Close.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.626
Okay, if this is too slutty,
I can change it.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.881
And if it's not slutty enough,
I can fix that, too.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.344
Any excuse to get out the body glitter.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.722
And done.

16:54.805 --> 16:58.017
Okay, come look in the mirror
while I grab those goggles.

17:03.897 --> 17:04.898
What do you think?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.234
Whoa.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.445
You hate it?

17:09.945 --> 17:10.988
No.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.781
It's awesome.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.200
Because you're awesome.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.037
So many people play it safe, but not you.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.246
Here you go.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.124
You're just like your mom.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.170
The Hammond women,
they go big or go home.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.717
Yeah.

17:33.844 --> 17:34.720
We do.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.269
Hey.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.190
-You're Abby Hammond's friend, right?
-Oh, uh...

17:46.857 --> 17:48.150
We're a little more than friends.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.612
There's a 3% chance we might
someday become lovers. Her words.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.448
Dude, I lost my virginity
when I was 13, so...

17:55.783 --> 17:58.243
-What do you got there?
-Um, it's a drone.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.370
Specifically a Parrot AR 2.0.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.623
What? That's sick!
That's...

18:02.998 --> 18:04.208
Yeah.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.835
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this.
Thanks, bro.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
Wait, what?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.380
What? No!
You can't just take things!

18:10.464 --> 18:12.925
Come on, man, we're almost adults!

18:17.846 --> 18:19.389
Hey! Christian.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.604
-[chuckles] You're gonna hit me with that?
-Give me my drone.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.272
No.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.613
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.912
[bell dings]

18:43.038 --> 18:44.957
-Hello?
-[Joel] Anyone here?

18:46.375 --> 18:49.044
Hey, buddy. Working alone?

18:49.753 --> 18:51.088
Let's look around.

18:54.049 --> 18:57.427
-We go through a lot of dish gloves.
-Yeah, well, we kill a lot of people.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.472
And sometimes do dishes.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.226
I know.
I just worry about our carbon footprint.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.312
We do our part. You know what happens
every time we kill someone?

19:08.605 --> 19:09.690
They drive less.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.024
Yeah.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.491
It's still AJ's shift. The next guy starts
in a half-hour, so we have to hurry.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.243
[gasps] Here are the monitors.

19:25.956 --> 19:26.915
[monitor beeps]

19:31.003 --> 19:34.381
So, do you think
I should just not work at all?

19:34.464 --> 19:35.424
I don't know, honey.

19:36.425 --> 19:40.179
Because killing and eating people
can't be the only thing that I do.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.889
Then I'd just be a monster.

19:41.972 --> 19:46.143
Well, you could have hobbies.
You like hiking, getting out into nature.

19:46.476 --> 19:50.564
You know who else likes hiking and nature?
Well-known monster Bigfoot.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.860
Just because one monster does those things
doesn't mean he gets to own them.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.695
Wait, there you are. Stop.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.246
No one but AJ is around.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.248
You're just staring at him.

20:17.049 --> 20:17.883
Wow.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.470
Where's that patience when you're waiting
for me to finish using the hair dryer?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.223
I've only been waiting on AJ for an hour.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.850
[gasps] Here he comes.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.482
Oh, I remember this.
He was mad 'cause I was staring at him.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.900
He thought it was creepy.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.862
[Joel] He pushed you!

20:38.946 --> 20:40.572
You can't just do that to someone.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.992
Yeah, well, spoiler alert, this does end
with his torso in our freezer.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.377
-[Joel] Oh!
-[both] Whoa!

21:02.344 --> 21:05.430
-You've gotten really good at that.
-Thanks! Anne's been teaching me.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.225
I wish I could show her this.
She'd be so impressed.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.519
No, I can't.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.528
Wait, that's it? I just left?

21:19.611 --> 21:21.405
We didn't see any blood outside.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.366
Maybe you didn't kill him here.
Maybe you followed him later--

21:25.033 --> 21:26.410
[both] Whoa!

21:37.838 --> 21:38.672
Wow.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.507
That was intense.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.551
Yeah.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.853
Oh, my God, you're using the boot
to kill his brain.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.272
But where did the boot go?

21:58.734 --> 21:59.818
[monitor beeps]

22:00.944 --> 22:01.945
[monitor beeps]

22:03.780 --> 22:04.656
The dog!

22:06.992 --> 22:09.953
All we have to do
is get inside this guy's mind.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.545
Hey, buddy.
Where do you hide things?

22:18.628 --> 22:21.923
Where on this vast lot
do you stash your secret...

22:23.675 --> 22:24.509
Oh.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.553
Under your butt.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.431
[dog whimpers]

22:30.557 --> 22:31.558
We got it.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.020
Look at you cleaning up.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.357
Just delete it
and we'll get out of here.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.988
Are you okay?

22:47.199 --> 22:50.327
When I'm killing someone,
it all feels natural, but...

22:50.786 --> 22:52.579
watching myself?

22:52.662 --> 22:55.582
Maybe you're right.
I shouldn't be around people.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.460
You should keep working with Carl
without me.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.672
We could just try it for a little while,
see how it feels.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.718
Yeah. I'll prep you
for that investor meeting today.

23:07.719 --> 23:08.595
Okay.

23:11.681 --> 23:15.143
Twenty-year partnership.
It was a good run.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.938
And we'll still be married, of course.

23:18.021 --> 23:22.943
And we have Abby,
and the house, and cars.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.654
Are you just listing things
we have in common?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.572
Patio furniture.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.866
The hair dryer.

23:32.035 --> 23:32.869
[computer beeps]

23:35.831 --> 23:37.374
That's it. It's done.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.836
Yeah. It was like it never happened.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.760
[video game sounds]

23:55.725 --> 23:58.270
Got the goggles. So, about tonight--

23:58.353 --> 24:00.397
Whoa, hey, wow. Look at your face.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.399
Oh, too much?

24:02.482 --> 24:04.484
No! No, you look amazing.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.154
-Thank you!
-Like a sexy raccoon.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.113
Mm...?

24:08.572 --> 24:12.200
They said I'd be better with girls when
I got my braces off, but I don't see it.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.286
Your mom got to me.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.329
So, about tonight,
I'm having some second thoughts.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.374
Oh, man, thank God.
Okay. [laughing] Me, too.

24:19.457 --> 24:22.127
Right, because graffiti on a billboard
isn't enough.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.588
I saw these crazy explosives
in Dan's closet.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.965
I'm thinking, if we really
wanna make an impact,

24:27.048 --> 24:29.259
we should blow up the trailer
on the fracking site.

24:29.342 --> 24:32.179
-Holy shit.
-I know. Go big or go home, right?

24:32.262 --> 24:33.805
-I can't do that.
-Well, don't worry.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.057
We're not gonna do it tonight.
We'll plan it out.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.602
No, I can't do any of that.
I don't even wanna do the graffiti.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.771
-What?
-The other day,

24:41.855 --> 24:44.608
when you called me a badass,
I wanted to be that guy.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.986
I tried to be that guy,
but I'm not.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.405
You can be.
We'll get you a couple of Mountain Dews.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.240
Abby, I'm sorry.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.117
I'm out.

24:56.536 --> 24:57.913
Oh. Okay.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.541
We can still get something to eat tonight,
if you want.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.586
No, I should go home,
do some research on this stuff.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.755
Right. Another time?

25:06.838 --> 25:08.048
Sure. Yeah.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.510
-Bye.
-Bye.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.139
[sighs]

25:16.848 --> 25:19.768
With eco-homes,
you save money and the planet,

25:19.851 --> 25:22.812
because living right
is the right way to live.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.739
This is just the kind of shit
my dad would've hated if he were alive.

25:34.115 --> 25:34.991
Let's do it.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.495
Yeah, fuck your dad!
God rest his soul.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.831
-Impressive work, Joel.
-Impressive work, Joel!

25:41.915 --> 25:44.000
-Thanks, Todd.
-Thanks, Todd!

25:44.084 --> 25:45.335
Carl's pretty excited.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.212
Carl's pretty excited!

25:47.796 --> 25:50.340
-[Joel] Honey?
-I'm in here!

25:51.341 --> 25:53.551
Oh, thank you.
You're cleaning the freezer.

25:53.635 --> 25:58.181
Yeah. I took AJ to the storage unit
and de-boned him so he'd fit in that.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.517
And I've almost got this one
back to normal,

26:00.600 --> 26:03.353
although the ice cubes
keep coming out red.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.022
-How was the pitch?
-I crushed it.

26:06.106 --> 26:10.902
That's so great.
Yay for the Hammon...d.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.989
-And then I quit.
-What?

26:14.072 --> 26:16.783
After the meeting,
Carl was breaking out the scotch.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.911
I realized I didn't get into this
because I love real estate.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.081
I got into this because I love you.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.043
"Hammond Realty"?

26:27.127 --> 26:30.088
If we can't work for someone else,
we'll work for ourselves.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.801
Really? You wanna start
our own company?

26:34.884 --> 26:37.554
I just spent nine dollars
on this sample business card,

26:37.637 --> 26:38.972
so there's no turning back.

26:39.556 --> 26:43.435
Well, I love it, because working with you
for 20 years wasn't enough.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.603
Then let's do 20 more.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.322
You wanna go upstairs
and do things to each other?

26:55.655 --> 26:56.865
Hotcha.

27:00.994 --> 27:04.914
This morning, I thought there was no way
this day would end well,

27:04.998 --> 27:08.418
-but we figured out who I murdered.
-And we never have to see Carl again.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.045
And, even in a blackout,

27:10.128 --> 27:13.715
I got Anne to stop looking
into our murders and start painting.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.343
[Joel] <i>It all worked out pretty well.</i>

27:23.391 --> 27:25.393
[suspenseful music]
