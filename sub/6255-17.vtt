WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.969
Look, all I'm saying
is that church could be good

00:02.971 --> 00:05.806
for Christine.
Will she learn about the Crusades

00:05.840 --> 00:07.141
and the Inquisition?

00:07.175 --> 00:08.942
Seriously?
Why don't you just read her

00:08.977 --> 00:11.545
a Superman comic?
It's also a fantasy

00:11.579 --> 00:14.415
about a mythic hero whose powers
defy the laws of physics

00:14.449 --> 00:16.717
and common sense.

00:16.751 --> 00:20.020
Okay. You're saying that Jesus
and Superman are the same?

00:20.054 --> 00:21.060
Jesus walks on water.

00:21.085 --> 00:22.890
Superman flies. No different.
I don't believe this.

00:22.891 --> 00:25.125
Listen to you. Christine
has already been baptized.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.162
She... You said were okay with that.
That was for you.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.130
I don't want Christine
to think that morality

00:30.165 --> 00:32.198
is handed down
by some invisible deity.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.668
Morality evolved to preserve
(phone rings)

00:34.702 --> 00:36.003
the species.
(sighs)

00:36.037 --> 00:38.038
Whoever this is,
thanks for saving me.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.807
Oh.

00:39.841 --> 00:41.708
Right, okay.
J-Just hold on for a second.

00:41.743 --> 00:44.411
We got to go to Virginia. They
found a body in a septic tank.

00:44.446 --> 00:46.013
No reason to go.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.415
Bring it to the lab to avoid
on-site contamination.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.384
Hold on for one second.
Okay, so you want to...

00:50.418 --> 00:53.720
dig up the entire septic system
and bring it back?

00:53.755 --> 00:55.355
It's not a desire-- it's a need.

00:55.390 --> 00:57.491
It's a... it's a need.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.294
Right. Okay. Um...

01:00.328 --> 01:02.262
(sighs)
Small favor.

01:02.297 --> 01:04.298
Shouldn't take long.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.867
(rumbling)

01:11.339 --> 01:13.373
BRENNAN:
Good.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.008
Now lower it gently

01:15.043 --> 01:19.246
so we avoid any postmortem
trauma to the remains.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.915
SAROYAN: Dr. Brennan, I'd like
to introduce you

01:21.950 --> 01:24.785
to Rodolfo Fuentes,
a prospective intern.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.287
It is such a pleasure
meeting you.

01:27.322 --> 01:29.690
I must tell you,
Dr. Brennan, I am in awe.

01:29.724 --> 01:31.458
I imagine you are.

01:31.493 --> 01:33.260
However, I'm not looking
for a new intern.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.429
Actually, we have
no available intern

01:35.463 --> 01:37.231
for you today, Dr. Brennan.

01:37.265 --> 01:41.502
So before you rush to judgment,
at least look at his résumé.

01:41.536 --> 01:44.938
(sighs, clears throat)

01:44.973 --> 01:47.875
Oh.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.612
Oh.

01:51.646 --> 01:53.647
You hold a doctorate in

01:53.681 --> 01:56.817
forensic anthropology from
la Universidad de La Habana?

01:56.851 --> 01:59.553
Dr. Fuentes was the chief
forensic anthropologist for

01:59.587 --> 02:00.443
the Cuban government.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.422
Although I was granted asylum
in your wonderful country,

02:02.423 --> 02:04.591
my accreditation
is no good here.

02:04.626 --> 02:09.029
But I am taking classes and need
an internship for my degree.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.564
The Secretary of State himself
requested

02:10.598 --> 02:11.999
that we find Dr. Fuentes
a position.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.767
So you defected.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.236
But I am exceptional. So I have

02:16.271 --> 02:17.538
come to America
to reap

02:17.572 --> 02:19.339
the fortunes that come
from being the best.

02:19.374 --> 02:21.675
But here you are only
exceptional if I say you are.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.844
Put on a lab coat and be back
here in five minutes.

02:23.878 --> 02:27.347
If you disappoint me,
I will dismiss you.

02:27.382 --> 02:29.149
How Cuban of you.

02:30.485 --> 02:32.352
She is fiery.
Yes.

02:32.387 --> 02:35.923
Be careful.
We've all been burned.

02:35.957 --> 02:38.592
SWEETS: <i>Dumping someone in a septic</i>
<i>tank treats the victim as</i>

02:38.626 --> 02:41.461
waste, not to mention the
potential toilet training issues

02:41.496 --> 02:44.131
the killer must be dealing with.
It's... interesting.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.832
Right. Sounds
fascinating. Hey.

02:45.867 --> 02:48.068
Let me ask you a question. Close
the door first really quick.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.104
I just sat down.

02:49.129 --> 02:50.938
It's, please. Hurry up.
I got to ask you a question.

02:50.939 --> 02:52.906
Really important.
All right, so...

02:52.941 --> 02:55.008
(sighs)
Sweets,

02:55.043 --> 02:56.343
are you religious?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.979
Am I religious? Uh, okay.
Mm-hmm.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.049
I... Well, I guess you could say
that I'm spiritual

03:02.083 --> 03:04.384
but not, uh, denominational.

03:04.419 --> 03:07.220
So you think that it's important
to have something in your life

03:07.255 --> 03:09.756
that's bigger than ourselves.

03:09.791 --> 03:11.792
Definitely. This is about you
and Dr. Brennan, huh?

03:11.826 --> 03:13.427
Look, I want Christine to go
to church so she has

03:13.461 --> 03:15.696
the information to choose
what's right for her.

03:15.730 --> 03:18.432
Okay? Bones thinks
that's indoctrination.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.733
So make the argument for church

03:19.767 --> 03:21.447
without addressing
the spiritual component.

03:21.469 --> 03:24.671
This is promising.
Go on. Keep going.

03:24.706 --> 03:27.074
Go on. Okay. Uh...

03:27.108 --> 03:29.309
recent studies have shown

03:29.344 --> 03:32.946
that regular church attendance
is good for your health.

03:32.981 --> 03:35.931
They cite decrease in blood
pressure, stronger immunity...

03:35.956 --> 03:36.450
Blood pressure.

03:36.451 --> 03:38.385
You are, like,
the greatest psychologist ever.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.354
Do you guys read, like,
a magazine or something?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.055
It's <i>American Psychiatric</i>
<i>Journal.</i>

03:42.090 --> 03:43.724
<i>American Psychiatric Journal?</i>

03:47.328 --> 03:49.196
So, you really met Fidel?

03:49.230 --> 03:52.966
Yes. I asked him if
socialism is so wonderful,

03:53.001 --> 03:55.936
why is Cuba's newest
car a 1959 Buick?

03:55.970 --> 03:58.705
Please focus, Dr. Fuentes.
Of course, Dr. Brennan.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.174
I still can't believe
you excavated the entire tank.

04:01.209 --> 04:03.010
It's so wasteful,
unnecessary

04:03.044 --> 04:04.845
and expensive.

04:04.879 --> 04:06.713
So American. I love it.

04:08.383 --> 04:10.917
Based on the rounded
supraorbital margin

04:10.952 --> 04:12.419
and partial closure
to the sphenofrontal

04:12.453 --> 04:14.521
suture, the victim
is an adult male.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.591
Please wait until
I ask, Dr. Fuentes.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.759
A thousand pardons.

04:18.793 --> 04:20.793
One is
sufficient.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.162
But you were
correct.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.697
Of course.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.632
Our situations could
easily be reversed.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.468
MONTENEGRO:
Easy there, Doc.

04:28.503 --> 04:29.703
Fidel's got nothing
on Brennan.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.271
BRENNAN:
There's extensive flesh

04:31.305 --> 04:33.473
and muscle that will
have to be removed.

04:33.508 --> 04:34.908
I thought the chemicals
in the tank

04:34.942 --> 04:36.176
would dissolve a person.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.411
It actually
takes longer

04:37.445 --> 04:39.246
for anaerobic bacteria
to dissolve flesh.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.315
Fortunately, the process
makes the meat tender

04:42.350 --> 04:44.851
and easy to separate.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.255
Much like cooking ropa vieja,

04:48.289 --> 04:49.690
a dish my father taught me

04:49.724 --> 04:52.159
that is filled
with love.

04:52.193 --> 04:54.661
And who can say no to love?

05:00.535 --> 05:02.436
Why have we
stopped working?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.570
Yeah.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.772
(clears throat)
So, I need to

05:05.807 --> 05:07.908
actually examine
the waste

05:07.942 --> 05:09.342
in order
determine

05:09.377 --> 05:10.977
what went in the tank
when the victim did.

05:11.012 --> 05:13.413
And we are clearly
missing bones

05:13.448 --> 05:15.248
that became disarticulated
in the tank.

05:15.283 --> 05:17.350
Without them it would be
presumptuous to posit

05:17.385 --> 05:19.886
whether this was a murder
or a tragic accident.

05:19.921 --> 05:21.154
Which is why Dr. Fuentes

05:21.189 --> 05:23.256
needs to be fitted
for a Hazmat suit.

05:31.299 --> 05:33.166
Oh...

05:36.237 --> 05:38.171
Oh...

05:38.206 --> 05:39.606
BRENNAN:
We are missing

05:39.640 --> 05:41.808
the fifth right distal phalanx,
the left medial

05:41.843 --> 05:43.376
and intermediate cuneiforms,

05:43.411 --> 05:45.078
as well as the right patella.

05:45.113 --> 05:47.848
Using your hands would allow for
a more productive search.

05:47.882 --> 05:50.083
This looks a lot like
the prison my uncle was sent to

05:50.118 --> 05:52.285
for selling <i>Die Hard</i> videos.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.689
Ugh...

05:57.358 --> 05:59.392
Is this really 
necessary, Dr. Brennan?

05:59.427 --> 06:00.794
Dr. Hodgins
would love to be in there.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.596
I am a little
jealous.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.098
This will teach Dr. Fuentes
his proper position in the lab.

06:05.133 --> 06:07.601
He's far too confident
he has all the answers.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.537
FUENTES:
I've found cause of death.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.973
Well, how can you be certain?

06:13.007 --> 06:14.975
Because...

06:15.009 --> 06:17.444
(grunts)

06:17.478 --> 06:19.479
...I, too, am excellent
at my job.

06:19.514 --> 06:21.548
I found this fingernail.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.217
The victim was still alive when
he was placed inside the tank.

06:24.252 --> 06:25.619
Tried to claw his way out.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.820
Oh, God...

06:26.854 --> 06:28.021
So he drowned
in there?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.322
FUENTES:
Yes.

06:29.357 --> 06:30.757
Ooh!

06:30.792 --> 06:32.292
Shall we share
a bottle of Arecha

06:32.326 --> 06:33.960

07:14.074 --> 07:15.395
BRENNAN:
Your X rays, Dr. Fuentes?

Yes. I have them here

In addition to

07:20.647 --> 07:22.715
the numerous
perimortem fractures,

07:22.749 --> 07:25.484
I also found a newly remodeled
sharp force injury

07:25.519 --> 07:26.986
to the medial aspect
of the left seventh rib.

07:27.020 --> 07:28.921
Oh, he was stabbed.

07:28.955 --> 07:30.189
How old's the injury?

07:30.223 --> 07:31.557
BRENNAN:
Based on the degree

07:31.591 --> 07:34.293
of remodeling,
approximately six months.

07:34.327 --> 07:36.195
Meaning our victim had

07:36.229 --> 07:38.063
a previous attempt on his life.

07:38.098 --> 07:39.732
Within the remodeling,
I see a shard

07:39.766 --> 07:42.501
of what appears
to be Plexiglas.

07:42.536 --> 07:43.936
I worked a lot
in prisons.

07:43.970 --> 07:45.538
The victim could have been
stabbed with a shiv.

07:45.572 --> 07:46.872
SAROYAN:
If he was,

07:46.907 --> 07:48.340
it's possible he served time,

07:48.375 --> 07:50.376
which could be a lucky break,
because...

07:50.410 --> 07:53.045
The Department of
Corrections keeps records

07:53.079 --> 07:55.648
of all the inmates' tattoos.

This here is Dr. Sweets.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.760
Nice to meet you.

08:07.794 --> 08:09.628
I, uh, brought notes

08:09.663 --> 08:11.230
from all of
Benny's appointments,

08:11.264 --> 08:12.831
drug tests and psych results.

08:12.866 --> 08:15.501
Gotta say, I didn't
see this coming.

08:15.535 --> 08:16.936
Jerguson seemed to be
on the right road.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.170
Where'd you find him?

08:18.204 --> 08:20.873
We, uh, we found him
in a septic tank.

08:20.907 --> 08:22.441
What?

08:22.475 --> 08:23.976
Mm-hmm.

08:24.010 --> 08:26.045
Did, uh, Benny have any issues
that you noticed?

08:26.079 --> 08:28.314
No. The guy was going
to Bible study, had a job,

08:28.348 --> 08:30.249
wasn't fraternizing
with any ex-cons

08:30.283 --> 08:32.585
from what I could tell.
Well, someone sure had it out for him.

08:32.619 --> 08:34.520
Yeah.
What kind of job did he get?

08:34.554 --> 08:35.754
Benny was a repossession agent.

08:35.789 --> 08:36.956
Repo man.

08:36.990 --> 08:38.756
It's a legit job.

08:38.792 --> 08:40.859
Ex-cons aren't exactly
a first choice for most people.

08:40.894 --> 08:43.462
Did he have any, uh, parole violations?
No.

08:43.496 --> 08:45.130
Only one incident on
his last job report,

08:45.165 --> 08:46.398
but it checked out.

08:46.433 --> 08:48.033
Yeah. It says
his boss

08:48.068 --> 08:50.436
was being sued
for $1.2 million.

08:50.470 --> 08:53.305
A woman felt endangered
while he was repoing her car?

08:53.340 --> 08:55.641
Ah, suits like that happen
all the time.

08:55.675 --> 08:57.643
Which is a pretty good motive,
wouldn't you say?

08:57.677 --> 08:59.945
Eh...

09:03.350 --> 09:05.250
Dr. Fuentes, have you finished

09:05.285 --> 09:06.552
cataloguing
the victim's injuries?

09:06.586 --> 09:07.987
Yes.

09:08.021 --> 09:09.855
It is all in the binder
as requested.

09:09.889 --> 09:12.124
I would also like
to be briefed

09:12.158 --> 09:14.360
on the investigation
the FBI is conducting.

09:14.394 --> 09:17.463
I will share
the information necessary

09:17.497 --> 09:19.632
for the tasks I give you.

09:21.301 --> 09:23.636
I hope I am not a threat to you.

09:23.670 --> 09:25.704
I only wish to excel
to make you look

09:25.739 --> 09:27.973
even better than you already do.

09:29.609 --> 09:31.443
The injuries.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.146
Of course.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.815
Our victim had numerous injuries
prior to death:

09:36.850 --> 09:39.752
compound fractures to the
left ribs, six through eight,

09:39.786 --> 09:42.454
as well as the sternum
and left frontal,

09:42.489 --> 09:45.724
all indicating a beating
or assault of some kind.

09:45.759 --> 09:49.094
Also a comminuted fracture
on the left clavicle.

09:49.129 --> 09:51.163
Which...
you missed.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.501
Inexcusable.

09:55.535 --> 09:56.735
I agree.

09:58.171 --> 10:00.539
I must admit,

10:00.573 --> 10:02.775
your English
is very good.

10:02.809 --> 10:04.410
Education was free in Cuba.

10:04.444 --> 10:07.079
I knew which skills
I would need once I defected.

10:07.113 --> 10:10.182
Well, it must have
taken great courage

10:10.216 --> 10:12.885
to leave your home and...

10:12.919 --> 10:14.420
start a new life here.

10:14.454 --> 10:17.656
My grandfather,
he fought for America

10:17.691 --> 10:19.858
at the Bay of Pigs.

10:19.893 --> 10:21.360
He died horribly

10:21.394 --> 10:23.362
so that one day
I would come to America

10:23.396 --> 10:26.331
and make many,
many of the Benjamins.

10:26.366 --> 10:28.600
I-I regret my
previous error.

10:28.635 --> 10:30.202
But according
to the injuries,

10:30.236 --> 10:33.138
our victim was beaten
by a right-handed man

10:33.173 --> 10:35.374
wielding a blunt
force weapon.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.211
Do you not agree?

10:40.346 --> 10:42.648
It is a distinct possibility.

10:42.682 --> 10:44.850
I am redeemed.

10:44.884 --> 10:47.920
(laughs)

10:50.123 --> 10:52.991
What the hell is it
you don't understand, bozo?

10:53.026 --> 10:54.660
You didn't make
your car payments.

10:54.694 --> 10:55.961
This is America.

10:55.995 --> 10:57.463
You don't get something
for nothing.

10:57.497 --> 10:59.598
MAN: Those were my wheels!
You stole my wheels!

10:59.632 --> 11:01.867
Nobody steals my wheels.
I ain't no thief. I am fully licensed,

11:01.901 --> 11:03.902
so take it up with the bank.
I'm warning you...

11:03.937 --> 11:05.738
No, I'm warning <i>you.</i>

11:05.772 --> 11:08.440
You're trespassing.
I'm counting to five and then

11:08.475 --> 11:11.643
I'm gonna start tenderizing you.
One, two,

11:11.678 --> 11:12.911
five!

11:12.936 --> 11:14.780
All right. Hey, look at
that. Nicely done.

11:14.781 --> 11:16.582
Hope you're not here
to argue, cause I'm still

11:16.583 --> 11:19.651
pumping adrenaline.
FBI. Need to ask you a few questions

11:19.686 --> 11:21.520
about Benny Jerguson.
Oh, crap.

11:21.554 --> 11:24.123
Is he back in jail? I thought
he was going to make it.

11:24.157 --> 11:26.692
No, Jerguson's dead,
Ms. Grace, murdered.

11:26.726 --> 11:29.027
Damn.

11:29.062 --> 11:30.295
I liked Benny.

11:30.330 --> 11:32.131
Man could jack a car
a dozen ways,

11:32.165 --> 11:33.932
then drive away
like a bat out of hell.

11:33.967 --> 11:36.568
Right. And you were sued for,
what, over a million dollars

11:36.603 --> 11:38.403
on a repo job he did for you?

11:38.438 --> 11:40.806
That was just a nuisance suit.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.741
You see this,
uh, digital recorder?

11:42.776 --> 11:44.076
I make all of my repo guys

11:44.110 --> 11:45.611
record every
repossession.

11:45.645 --> 11:48.180
That way,
whenever I get sued,

11:48.214 --> 11:50.115
I'm not the one with
her nuts in a vise.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.950
Right. Well, we'll need that recorder.
Yeah.

11:51.985 --> 11:53.218
Yeah, I'm sure you would.

11:53.253 --> 11:55.087
The thing is
that Benny had his own.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.355
It wasn't on him?

11:56.389 --> 11:58.690
No, it wasn't on him.
See, the room he rented

11:58.725 --> 12:00.559
on that parole form,
it was all cleared out.

12:00.593 --> 12:02.561
Well, that's 'cause
he slept here most nights

12:02.595 --> 12:04.663
to save money.
He only made $75 per job.

12:04.697 --> 12:07.166
So, he lived here--
still don't have the recorder?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.735
You're not very trusting,
are you, kiddo?

12:09.769 --> 12:11.036
No, not right now.

12:11.070 --> 12:11.970
Well, then screw you.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.472
Okay, well,
in this line of work,

12:13.506 --> 12:15.808
you have to figure that there's
someone out there

12:15.842 --> 12:18.210
who wanted to, I don't know,
what, pound him?

12:18.244 --> 12:20.813
There was this one jaghole.

12:20.847 --> 12:23.081
Clown named Graham something.

12:23.116 --> 12:25.117
Claimed Benny ruined
his whole life

12:25.151 --> 12:26.819
when he jacked the
guy's food truck,

12:26.853 --> 12:30.189
comes here with
a big-ass knife.

12:30.223 --> 12:32.024
And you didn't think
of that right away?

12:32.058 --> 12:35.561
You need a nicer partner,
you know that, honey?

12:35.595 --> 12:36.862
Right, okay,

12:36.896 --> 12:38.530
I'm gonna need all the paperwork
you have

12:38.565 --> 12:39.731
on this Graham something.

12:39.766 --> 12:42.267
Sure. I got nothing to hide.

12:42.302 --> 12:43.735
Great.

12:50.501 --> 12:51.902
SWEETS:
Ah, you're right.

12:51.936 --> 12:54.104
I guess the food
isn't too good.

12:54.138 --> 12:56.506
But business is.

12:59.644 --> 13:01.077
Okay, you ready?

13:05.149 --> 13:06.183
Hey, Graham.

13:06.217 --> 13:08.652
I think I might know
why you were so upset

13:08.686 --> 13:09.686
when your truck was repossessed.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.055
Do I know you?
Nope.

13:12.089 --> 13:13.757
Now you do. FBI.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.559
I have to ask you a
few questions about

13:15.593 --> 13:16.827
your behavior
when that happened.

13:16.861 --> 13:20.063
Okay. I mean, I was mad
when they repoed my truck,

13:20.097 --> 13:22.065
but I paid what I owed.
Case closed, right?

13:22.099 --> 13:23.233
SWEETS:
Actually, no.

13:23.267 --> 13:25.435
The guy who took your truck
wound up murdered.

13:25.469 --> 13:28.238
Oh. Well, that's terrible,

13:28.272 --> 13:29.847
but what does that have
to do with me?

13:29.848 --> 13:31.749
You threatened him
with a knife.

13:31.784 --> 13:34.719
I-I lost my temper, but...

13:34.753 --> 13:36.254
And you sell drugs.

13:36.288 --> 13:37.822
What?

13:37.856 --> 13:39.490
Lost your truck,
lost your stash, right?

13:39.525 --> 13:41.526
Yeah, maybe Benny found it,
threatened to turn you in.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.561
You guys
are seriously reaching, huh?

13:43.595 --> 13:45.496
Reaching? Really?
You recognize this  guy over here?

13:45.531 --> 13:47.899
This customer that you just
sold a sandwich to. Oh-ho!

13:47.933 --> 13:49.300
Look at that, huh?

13:49.334 --> 13:50.635
He's with the FBI, too.

13:55.507 --> 13:59.343
There are multiple
Monteggia fractures

13:59.378 --> 14:01.913
on the victim's left
ulna and radius.

14:01.947 --> 14:04.415
A common injury when
a victim is beaten

14:04.450 --> 14:06.117
and tries to
defend himself.

14:06.151 --> 14:08.486
However, they are not defensive,
as you surmise.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.622
These fractures occurred
when his own body collided

14:11.657 --> 14:13.057
with his outstretched arm.

14:13.091 --> 14:15.393
See how the injuries line up?

14:15.427 --> 14:17.061
As would happen
in a car accident.

14:17.095 --> 14:20.598
Yes.
If our victim was in the driver's seat,

14:20.632 --> 14:22.700
a head-on collision not only
explains the fractures

14:22.734 --> 14:24.268
to the ulna and radius,

14:24.303 --> 14:26.804
but all injuries which
I attributed to the beating.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.907
Excellent work, Dr. Brennan.

14:29.942 --> 14:32.310
You should be very proud.

14:32.344 --> 14:36.180
You are not in a position
to evaluate me.

14:36.215 --> 14:38.182
I am your boss.

14:38.217 --> 14:39.851
(chuckles)

14:39.885 --> 14:42.019
Why are you smiling at me?

14:42.054 --> 14:46.357
You and I, I sense tension.

14:46.391 --> 14:48.593
I think soon we'll make love.

14:49.895 --> 14:51.229
(chuckles nervously)

14:51.263 --> 14:54.232
That will not be happening,
Dr. Fuentes.

14:54.266 --> 14:57.235
And if you would like
to continue working here,

14:57.269 --> 14:59.770
you will not make
that suggestion again.

14:59.805 --> 15:01.138
Of course.

15:01.173 --> 15:02.940
But it is a pity.

15:02.975 --> 15:06.143
And it would also be a pity
if you were sent back to Cuba

15:06.178 --> 15:08.145
for abusing the generous nature
of this country.

15:08.180 --> 15:10.481
Perhaps I am suffering
from loneliness

15:10.516 --> 15:12.149
of being in a new land.

15:12.184 --> 15:15.286
I hope so. Now go over these
bones again and determine why

15:15.320 --> 15:17.255
there is no head trauma
from the steering wheel.

15:17.289 --> 15:19.790
Right away.

15:22.194 --> 15:23.661
(chuckles)

15:23.695 --> 15:25.997
Ay-ay-ay.
(speaks Spanish)

15:26.031 --> 15:28.132
BOOTH:
<i>Food truck guy didn't do it.</i>

15:28.166 --> 15:29.667
BRENNAN:
<i>Oh, he has an alibi?</i>

15:29.701 --> 15:32.336
Graham was in Mexico
replacing his stash.

15:32.371 --> 15:34.305
You know, the video
at the Border Patrol

15:34.339 --> 15:36.173
confirms that,
so it backs up his story.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.109
Well, at least you were
able to arrest him

15:38.143 --> 15:39.343
on possession
with intent.

15:39.378 --> 15:41.846
Yeah, you know what?
He's gonna be out in a week.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.148
So, what about you?
Did you come up with anything?

15:44.182 --> 15:45.850
Progress is slower
than I'd prefer.

15:45.884 --> 15:49.153
I had a new intern forced upon
me by the Secretary of State.

15:49.187 --> 15:51.889
You mean, the real
Secretary of State?

15:51.924 --> 15:53.791
Yes.
Whoa!

15:53.825 --> 15:55.893
Dr. Fuentes is a defector
from Cuba.

15:55.928 --> 15:58.930
Brilliant but arrogant.

15:58.964 --> 16:00.264
Mm, brilliant and arrogant.

16:00.299 --> 16:01.966
Must be tough to work with, huh?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.435
It is.
I-I know it is.

16:04.469 --> 16:05.937
I forgot to tell ya.

16:05.971 --> 16:08.105
I was reading this really
interesting article

16:08.140 --> 16:09.974
in the <i>American Psychiatric</i>
<i>Journal.</i>

16:10.008 --> 16:11.909
You were? Why?

16:11.944 --> 16:13.978
Me, why?
I'm a lifelong learner.

16:14.012 --> 16:15.880
Anyway, in the article
it was saying

16:15.914 --> 16:19.884
that research shows that going
to church actually, uh, boosts

16:19.918 --> 16:21.385
your immune system, okay,

16:21.420 --> 16:25.723
decreases your blood pressure
and reduces stress.

16:25.757 --> 16:28.960
It's kind of like an antioxidant
from God. Huh.

16:28.994 --> 16:30.227
That's supposed to convince me

16:30.262 --> 16:31.829
that Christine should go
to church?

16:31.863 --> 16:34.298
I'm just, you know, concerned
about the health of our child.

16:34.333 --> 16:35.800
Look, if that's
not important to you...

16:35.834 --> 16:37.201
I can't believe you said that.

16:37.235 --> 16:38.769
What? This is about science.

16:38.804 --> 16:42.106
Tell you what,
I'll e-mail the article to you.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.942
It's got all those big, fancy
words in it that you love.

16:44.977 --> 16:47.211
I also read a study which states
that 86%

16:47.245 --> 16:49.113
of all holy water
contains fecal matter.

16:49.147 --> 16:51.582
Hmm?

16:51.617 --> 16:54.485
All I'm saying is that if health
is your argument,

16:54.519 --> 16:57.321
I would pick filtered over holy.

16:57.356 --> 16:59.357
I'll e-mail you that article.

16:59.391 --> 17:02.093
<i>All right, within the victim's</i>

17:02.127 --> 17:04.729
torn clothes,
I found aces of shore leaf pine,

17:04.762 --> 17:06.464
scarlet maple,
and prickly ash.

17:06.498 --> 17:09.066
All native to the woods near
where the body was found.

17:09.101 --> 17:11.301
Which means his clothes were
ripped on the foliage

17:11.336 --> 17:13.404
as he was running
through the woods?

17:13.438 --> 17:14.672
Clearly he was chased.

17:14.705 --> 17:16.440
I would not rush
to a conclusion.

17:16.474 --> 17:17.675
Dr. Brennan doesn't like that.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.710
There's much she doesn't like.

17:19.744 --> 17:22.613
Answers, evidence,
she likes those.

17:22.647 --> 17:24.582
Then I maintain my assertion that
he was chased.

17:24.616 --> 17:27.184
Our victim had a compound
fracture to the right fibula

17:27.219 --> 17:29.120
and shearing to the tibia
from the fibula

17:29.154 --> 17:30.588
rubbing against it.

17:30.622 --> 17:33.057
You think he could run
on a compound fracture?

17:33.091 --> 17:36.027
A release of adrenaline can make
someone do extraordinary things.

17:36.061 --> 17:37.662
Based on the degree
of bone damage,

17:37.696 --> 17:40.598
I estimate he ran
for nearly a quarter mile.

17:40.632 --> 17:42.333
Only a desperate man
being chased

17:42.367 --> 17:44.368
could endure such pain.

17:44.403 --> 17:47.705
All right, I also found
flakes of hunter-green paint

17:47.739 --> 17:49.540
on his shirt,
and look at this.

17:49.574 --> 17:52.209
A curved fragment
of faux birch,

17:52.244 --> 17:54.478
most likely from
the steering wheel.

17:54.513 --> 17:57.114
Based on the fractures
to the ribs, ulna and radius,

17:57.149 --> 17:59.016
the car didn't have
an air bag.

17:59.051 --> 18:00.425
So, pre-1994.

18:00.426 --> 18:01.920
The last thing I found was
a shard

18:01.945 --> 18:04.289
of dual-paned glass
from the windshield.

18:04.656 --> 18:07.258
And it matches the profile
of a manufacturer in South Korea.

18:07.292 --> 18:09.827
Which means we're looking
for a Hyundai or a Kia.

18:09.861 --> 18:10.795
One that crashed

18:10.829 --> 18:13.164
a quarter mile where
the victim was found.

18:15.801 --> 18:17.134
Here, look,
this is the car

18:17.169 --> 18:18.636
Benny was driving
when he crashed.

18:18.670 --> 18:19.670
Holy crap.

18:19.705 --> 18:22.073
It's a miracle he lived.

18:22.107 --> 18:23.307
He drowned in sewage.

18:23.341 --> 18:24.909
Right. I guess
that's not a miracle.

18:24.943 --> 18:26.143
Was he repoing the car?

18:26.178 --> 18:27.418
Maybe the owner
was chasing him.

18:27.446 --> 18:28.813
Not, it was registered
to Benny.

18:28.847 --> 18:30.748
So has the lab found
anything in the car

18:30.782 --> 18:32.383
that could lead us
to the killer?

18:32.417 --> 18:33.551
No, they won't.

18:33.585 --> 18:36.053
The car was scrapped a week
after it was found.

18:36.088 --> 18:38.189
Those photos
are the only evidence we have.

18:38.223 --> 18:41.158
Were there any other tire tracks
at the scene

18:41.193 --> 18:43.360
that could tie us
to an assailant?

18:43.395 --> 18:44.929
No, nothing.
There were heavy rains,

18:44.963 --> 18:46.130
therefore,
there were no footprints,

18:46.164 --> 18:48.265
there was no evidence
of anyone at all.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.667
We know that

18:49.701 --> 18:52.169
he was chased
from the site of the accident

18:52.204 --> 18:53.871
and thrown in the septic tank.

18:53.905 --> 18:56.173
Yeah, but that's all we have.

18:58.892 --> 19:00.492
SAROYAN: He was probably
forced off the road

19:00.527 --> 19:01.994
by whoever was chasing him.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.084
Is there enough detail in these
photos to be valuable?

19:05.372 --> 19:06.739
Well, there <i>will</i> be,

19:06.774 --> 19:08.708
but the towing company
used an 18-megapixel

19:08.742 --> 19:11.644
CMOS, which means
I can work a little magic.

19:11.679 --> 19:16.182
Perhaps Hodgins can match
the particulates to the damage.

19:16.217 --> 19:17.951
And Dr. Fuentes should see how

19:17.985 --> 19:20.487
the damage to the car
matches the fracture patterns.

19:20.521 --> 19:22.122
I'll go get them.

19:22.156 --> 19:24.124
No, not yet.

19:24.158 --> 19:28.161
I need a break
from Dr. Fuentes.

19:29.396 --> 19:31.431
I find him to be arrogant

19:31.465 --> 19:34.334
and conceited and preemptory.

19:34.368 --> 19:36.035
You forgot hot.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.804
You are married, Angela.
Don't tell me

19:37.838 --> 19:39.873
you haven't looked at that guy
and thought that you...

19:39.907 --> 19:42.108
This is not workplace
conversation.

19:42.143 --> 19:45.111
I'll take that as a yes.

19:45.146 --> 19:46.980
Angela, enlarge the driver's
side of the car.

19:50.284 --> 19:52.218
Okay, I don't...

19:52.253 --> 19:55.321
I don't see anything.
What did you see?

19:55.356 --> 19:57.090
Nothing.

19:57.124 --> 19:58.591
Uh, I don't understand.

19:58.626 --> 20:00.426
Benny was a great
getaway driver.

20:00.461 --> 20:02.695
So whoever was chasing
him would have had

20:02.730 --> 20:04.931
to hit the car
to run him off the road.

20:04.965 --> 20:06.499
But why did he crash?

20:06.534 --> 20:09.569
The tox screen showed
he wasn't drunk or stoned.

20:09.603 --> 20:12.071
Look at the front windshield.

20:13.908 --> 20:18.611
There are two distinct webs of
radial fracturing in the glass.

20:18.646 --> 20:20.747
Benny wasn't alone in that car.

20:24.418 --> 20:25.685
(knocking)

20:25.719 --> 20:26.920
Excuse me, Agent Booth.

20:26.954 --> 20:29.389
Officer Fowler. Come on in.

20:29.423 --> 20:31.791
After we talked, I couldn't stop
thinking about Benny.

20:31.825 --> 20:34.594
I really thought he was someone who
was gonna make it.

20:34.628 --> 20:36.196
Then I remembered this.

20:36.230 --> 20:38.164
What's this?
Horatio Mancini?

20:38.199 --> 20:40.633
Horatio grew up
with Benny on the wrong side

20:40.668 --> 20:42.202
of Pennsylvania Avenue.

20:42.236 --> 20:45.104
Benny's mother was a meth head,
never knew who his father was.

20:45.139 --> 20:46.573
Horatio became everything to him.
Right.

20:46.607 --> 20:48.942
So why didn't you mention this
the last time we talked?

20:48.976 --> 20:50.310
I didn't think it was relevant.

20:50.344 --> 20:52.946
Horatio got sent to jail
the same time as Benny,

20:52.980 --> 20:54.214
only Benny got an early parole

20:54.248 --> 20:56.249
because he was cooperating
with the warden.

20:56.283 --> 20:58.685
Apparently, Horatio was shaking
down some of the other inmates.

20:58.719 --> 21:00.553
So he ratted on Horatio
in exchange

21:00.588 --> 21:02.388
for a shorter sentence?
Yeah.

21:02.423 --> 21:06.226
But because of overcrowding,
Horatio got released early.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.961
One week before
Benny was killed.

21:10.331 --> 21:11.598
The trajectory of abrasions

21:11.632 --> 21:13.233
to the ribs
and transverse fracture

21:13.267 --> 21:15.068
to the sternum were caused by
the steering wheel.

21:15.102 --> 21:17.570
The victim was driving
at the time of the accident.

21:17.605 --> 21:19.973
You are restating an already
established fact, Dr. Fuentes.

21:20.007 --> 21:21.174
I'm setting the scene.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.143
Please, come.
Come closer.

21:24.178 --> 21:26.713
<i>Vamos, vamos.</i>
Let us pretend that we are

21:26.747 --> 21:29.549
driver and passenger
in the car. I'll drive.

21:29.583 --> 21:32.819
Fine. I have no objection
to you being killed.

21:32.853 --> 21:34.420
Mm.

21:34.455 --> 21:36.856
In a typical accident,
at point of impact,

21:36.890 --> 21:39.058
the driver would lurch forward,

21:39.093 --> 21:40.727
and we would find
bilateral fractures

21:40.761 --> 21:43.596
in the left and
right ulnae and radii.

21:43.631 --> 21:45.832
However, on the victim,
the fracturing occurred unilaterally

21:45.866 --> 21:47.800
on just the left side
of the body.

21:47.835 --> 21:50.603
Meaning the victim was turned

21:50.638 --> 21:51.971
and reaching toward
the passenger.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.606
What-what are you doing?

21:53.641 --> 21:55.074
Reenacting the accident.

21:55.109 --> 21:56.643
Quite well, I thought.

21:56.677 --> 21:57.844
In that case,

21:57.878 --> 21:59.879
I will continue the reenactment.
Mm-hmm.

21:59.913 --> 22:01.614
And posit that the driver

22:01.649 --> 22:03.716
and the passenger were grappling
with one another. (mumbling)

22:03.751 --> 22:06.419
Wait. (groans)
A struggle would also

22:06.453 --> 22:08.755
explain the cause
of the accident.

22:08.789 --> 22:11.257
Do you not agree, Dr. Fuentes?
I do.

22:11.292 --> 22:13.393
You have surprisingly
great strength, Dr. Brennan.

22:13.427 --> 22:14.827
I know.

22:14.862 --> 22:16.262
Is there anything else?

22:16.297 --> 22:19.232
Yes. If you would let me up...

22:20.334 --> 22:22.368
I found a comminuted

22:22.403 --> 22:24.771
fracture to the right fifth rib,

22:24.805 --> 22:28.007
inconsistent with the abrasion
left by the steering wheel.

22:28.042 --> 22:31.110
When Hodgins swabbed,
he found traces of silicon,

22:31.145 --> 22:32.812
like that found
in microprocessors.

22:32.846 --> 22:34.814
The injuries had
to be caused by something

22:34.848 --> 22:36.282
the victim was carrying,

22:36.317 --> 22:38.685
because they were localized
on the rib.

22:38.719 --> 22:40.687
Very good.

22:40.721 --> 22:43.156
Please reexamine the ribs.

22:46.026 --> 22:48.961
BOOTH: <i>So, this guy, Horatio--</i>
<i>he works</i>

22:48.996 --> 22:50.363
parking cars at Bellamy's.

22:50.397 --> 22:51.631
They probably didn't know

22:51.665 --> 22:53.366
that he was a car thief.
Mm.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.135
The new intern thought that
he and I would be having sex.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.404
Whoa! Whoa! What?!

22:58.439 --> 23:00.673
Sex. He thought
we would have sex.

23:00.708 --> 23:01.874
Wait a second.

23:01.909 --> 23:03.076
The Cuban guy?

23:03.110 --> 23:04.777
All right, he flat out told you

23:04.812 --> 23:06.813
he wants to have sex with you?

23:06.847 --> 23:08.548
Yes, he was quite brazen.

23:08.582 --> 23:10.650
Whoa-oh.
Although I imagine

23:10.684 --> 23:12.985
all of my male interns
want to have sex with me.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.488
Uh... you do realize that
you're talking out loud?

23:15.522 --> 23:17.156
What you just said there.

23:17.191 --> 23:18.624
You're upset.

23:18.659 --> 23:20.560
You know I would
never sleep with him.

23:20.594 --> 23:22.128
Well, you know what?
You did tell me once

23:22.162 --> 23:24.097
that you thought that
monogamy was unnatural.

23:24.131 --> 23:25.231
Yes.

23:25.265 --> 23:26.699
That's true.
Before I realized

23:26.734 --> 23:28.901
that we were symbiotic.

23:28.936 --> 23:31.070
Like a clown fish
and a sea anemone.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.939
What?! What are you
talking about, Nemo?

23:32.973 --> 23:35.041
That doesn't sound
very romantic.

23:35.075 --> 23:36.843
I disagree.

23:36.877 --> 23:39.712
You and I,
we're bound to one another.

23:39.747 --> 23:41.614
So much so that I don't feel

23:41.648 --> 23:44.350
that I could survive
without you.

23:44.385 --> 23:47.253
You nurture me.
You protect me.

23:47.287 --> 23:48.821
You are my home.

23:48.856 --> 23:52.091
If I were to damage that
by a meaningless dalliance,

23:52.126 --> 23:54.327
it would be like
killing myself.

23:54.361 --> 23:57.497
Something that
I would never do.

23:57.531 --> 24:00.733
That sounded a little better.

24:00.768 --> 24:01.934
I would never let
anything compromise

24:01.969 --> 24:03.369
the life we share, Booth.

24:03.404 --> 24:05.004
I love you.

24:05.038 --> 24:07.874
Okay, now that's romantic.

24:07.908 --> 24:09.275
(laughs)
I love you, too.

24:09.309 --> 24:10.949
Come here. Come on,
give us a little kiss.

24:10.978 --> 24:12.812
I'm not gonna kiss you
while you're driving.

24:12.846 --> 24:14.647
Hold the steering wheel,
and give me a kiss.

24:14.681 --> 24:16.549
I don't...
Come on, you can do it.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.151
Hold it right there. You got it?
I don't know if that's safe.

24:18.185 --> 24:19.752
Just go straight. You
got to give me a kiss.

24:19.787 --> 24:20.987
Okay, you can't say
that I'm not romantic now.

24:21.021 --> 24:23.222
Okay. Look at that! Teamwork!
Oh!

24:23.257 --> 24:26.159
Compromise!
(laughs)

24:26.193 --> 24:28.694
(indistinct chatter)

24:30.164 --> 24:32.865
MAN:
Here you go, sir.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.567
Bones, Bones.

24:34.601 --> 24:35.902
That's Horatio.

24:35.936 --> 24:37.103
BRENNAN: A lot of
beautiful cars.

24:37.137 --> 24:38.104
He must be quite happy here.

24:38.138 --> 24:39.739
Don't worry about
the cars, huh?

24:39.773 --> 24:41.174
Horatio?

24:41.208 --> 24:42.942
FBI.

24:42.976 --> 24:44.477
I need to ask you a few
questions about Benny Jerguson.

24:44.511 --> 24:46.579
Oh. Uh, you got
the wrong guy.

24:46.613 --> 24:48.014
I'm Carlos, not Horatio.

24:48.048 --> 24:49.715
Everyone makes that mistake.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.584
Uh, Horatio's
pulling up right now.

24:52.286 --> 24:53.519
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

24:53.554 --> 24:54.787
Please, Bones,
stay back.

24:54.822 --> 24:57.423
Bones, easy. No, no,
no. Slow, slow. - What?

24:58.692 --> 25:00.893
Easy, easy. Hey,
hey, hey, hey, easy!

25:00.928 --> 25:02.061
Just stay here, okay?
No!

25:02.095 --> 25:04.130
No, no...

25:07.601 --> 25:10.470
Oh, oh, oh, easy,
easy, easy, easy, okay?

25:10.504 --> 25:11.971
Just relax, just watch.

25:12.005 --> 25:14.273
I got the gun.
Just stay behind me.

25:14.308 --> 25:16.409
(man speaking Spanish)

25:19.746 --> 25:20.947
I don't see him.

25:20.981 --> 25:23.483
BRENNAN: Oh!
(grunts)

25:30.290 --> 25:31.824
Hey, look out!

25:37.564 --> 25:39.832
MAN:
Are you crazy?

25:42.870 --> 25:45.404
Booth!

25:45.439 --> 25:46.572
Hey, hey!

25:46.607 --> 25:48.341
(both grunting)

25:53.347 --> 25:55.214
Really? With the lettuce?

25:55.249 --> 25:56.482
Duck!
Aah!

26:00.153 --> 26:01.754
(grunts)

26:02.756 --> 26:03.956
Oh, oh!

26:07.761 --> 26:09.262
Whew!

26:09.296 --> 26:10.796
All right.
Oh!

26:10.831 --> 26:12.832
(laughs)
(kitchen staff clapping)

26:15.269 --> 26:17.837
Nothing more romantic than a man

26:17.871 --> 26:20.740
who can handle himself
in the kitchen.

26:20.774 --> 26:23.309
Right.

26:23.994 --> 26:26.029
How many times
do I have to tell you

26:26.030 --> 26:27.731
I didn't kill Benny?

26:27.765 --> 26:29.199
He was like a brother to me.

26:29.234 --> 26:30.714
A brother who turned
on you in prison.

26:30.735 --> 26:32.469
You got it wrong.

26:32.503 --> 26:35.105
I told Benny to rat me out
so he'd get an early release.

26:35.139 --> 26:37.341
Yo, he was getting beaten in
prison every day. Shived once.

26:37.375 --> 26:39.576
Right. You're just
a bighearted guy, right?

26:39.611 --> 26:41.645
Who just ran away
and attacked a Federal agent.

26:41.679 --> 26:44.114
I didn't run because of Benny.

26:44.148 --> 26:45.816
You ran
because you were downloading

26:45.850 --> 26:47.251
keyless entry systems to cars

26:47.285 --> 26:49.519
that you were supposed
to be valeting.

26:49.554 --> 26:52.623
We got it all off
your smart phone.

26:52.657 --> 26:54.558
You were gonna steal those cars.

26:54.592 --> 26:57.227
What? You're expecting
a confession?

26:57.262 --> 26:58.262
When was the last time
you saw Benny?

26:58.296 --> 26:59.663
Right when I got out the joint.

26:59.697 --> 27:00.864
But he came to me.

27:00.899 --> 27:02.432
And I told him to get lost.

27:02.467 --> 27:04.067
"Get lost"?
This guy you thought of

27:04.102 --> 27:06.503
as your brother,
you told him to "get lost"?

27:06.537 --> 27:08.739
Yeah.. 'Cause I knew he had a
better chance without me.

27:08.773 --> 27:10.540
I mean, Benny got
a job, a real one.

27:10.575 --> 27:12.409
All on his own.
(laughs)

27:12.443 --> 27:14.177
I was proud of him.

27:14.212 --> 27:15.946
I didn't want
to mess that up.

27:15.980 --> 27:18.916
Because you knew you were
going to keep stealing cars?

27:18.950 --> 27:22.052
I know who I am, okay?

27:22.086 --> 27:24.388
I wish I could change
but some things are

27:24.422 --> 27:25.989
just the way they are.

27:26.024 --> 27:28.525
But Benny...
(laughs)

27:28.559 --> 27:29.893
Benny had a ot.

27:29.928 --> 27:31.528
He was talking
about getting married,

27:31.562 --> 27:33.563
raising kids.

27:33.598 --> 27:35.632
Hmm. What did he want from you?

27:35.667 --> 27:39.703
Encryption codes to break
into a BMW 7 Series.

27:41.072 --> 27:43.073
I told him no,
but he begged me.

27:43.107 --> 27:45.776
Said it's just one car.

27:45.810 --> 27:48.545
I guess he wasn't gonna make it.

27:48.579 --> 27:50.614
He was a good guy.

27:50.648 --> 27:53.183
Said he didn't have a choice.

27:53.217 --> 27:55.252
You know, I told him,
"Let me do it."

27:55.286 --> 27:56.653
But he wouldn't let me.

27:56.688 --> 27:57.754
Said it'd be safer

27:57.789 --> 27:59.222
if I didn't get involved.

28:01.025 --> 28:04.594
I should've went with him.

28:08.299 --> 28:09.433
MONTENEGRO: <i>So this is everything</i>
<i>you were able</i>

28:09.467 --> 28:10.667
<i>to get from the septic fluid?</i>

28:10.702 --> 28:11.768
HODGINS:
<i>Everything made of silicone.</i>

28:11.803 --> 28:14.304
Unfortunately this is just

28:14.339 --> 28:15.772
shattered substrate
from a motherboard.

28:15.807 --> 28:17.574
Well, any clue what
it used to be?

28:17.608 --> 28:19.142
From this?
(groans)

28:19.177 --> 28:20.677
This could be anything.

28:20.712 --> 28:22.813
Uh, cell phone, digital camera.

28:22.847 --> 28:24.481
Maybe even a toaster.

28:24.515 --> 28:26.717
Our best bet
in recovering anything

28:26.751 --> 28:28.251
is to do a J-tag examination.

28:28.286 --> 28:29.653
And by best bet,
you mean...?

28:29.687 --> 28:32.422
(groans)
Approximately slim to none.

28:32.457 --> 28:34.624
For you.

28:34.659 --> 28:36.159
From the right fifth rib.

28:36.194 --> 28:37.361
What is it?

28:37.395 --> 28:38.795
Huh.

28:38.830 --> 28:41.565
Appears to be a piece
of a silicone chip.

28:41.599 --> 28:44.167
Which might help you
in completing your puzzle.

28:44.202 --> 28:46.370
Wow, good job there, brother.

28:46.404 --> 28:49.039
I couldn't have done it without
all the support I get here.

28:49.073 --> 28:50.574
Part of that
is the way you look.

28:50.608 --> 28:52.009
(laughs)

28:54.879 --> 28:56.279
(sighs)

28:56.314 --> 28:57.948
It's not...

28:57.982 --> 29:00.183
just about the money.

29:03.021 --> 29:06.023
My father always
wanted me to defect.

29:06.057 --> 29:08.258
He wanted this life for me.

29:08.292 --> 29:11.161
He fought the government,
was sent to prison

29:11.195 --> 29:13.230
three times.

29:13.264 --> 29:16.633
I couldn't
leave him there alone.

29:16.667 --> 29:20.003
When he died...

29:26.144 --> 29:29.446
My life here is for him.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.549
My success?
It-it will show my people

29:32.583 --> 29:35.652
what's possible.

29:41.159 --> 29:43.260
Well, he's tough
to dislike.

29:43.294 --> 29:46.329
(laughs) Even though you need
to take a cold shower.

29:49.067 --> 29:50.400
BOOTH:
<i>So, what you have here</i>

29:50.435 --> 29:51.535
is every car theft report
in Virginia

29:51.569 --> 29:52.736
in the past three months.

29:52.770 --> 29:54.571
This is not
really my job, Booth.

29:54.605 --> 29:56.125
No, it is
when the bureau is backlogged

29:56.140 --> 29:57.307
and there's budget cuts.

29:57.341 --> 29:58.875
No, actually not.

29:58.910 --> 30:00.744
I'm trained to...

30:00.778 --> 30:02.312
To catch the bad guys, okay?

30:02.346 --> 30:04.187
If you don't pitch in
to help catch the killer,

30:04.215 --> 30:06.283
he goes free
and it's on your head.

30:06.317 --> 30:08.919
Now you're using guilt, Booth.
That-that's beneath you.

30:08.953 --> 30:11.021
No, not really.
See, I'm all about results.

30:11.055 --> 30:12.722
I'm a result-oriented guy.
Okay, so Benny

30:12.757 --> 30:14.858
and Horatio went after
the luxury brand models.

30:14.892 --> 30:16.760
Typically they'd go
in the middle of the night,

30:16.794 --> 30:18.695
and they'd steal the car right
out of the guy's garage.

30:18.729 --> 30:21.031
What are there ones? What are
the ones with the Post-its?

30:21.065 --> 30:23.667
Thefts that match Benny's M.O.

30:23.701 --> 30:24.868
Geez.

30:24.902 --> 30:26.002
Five in the past three months.

30:26.037 --> 30:27.037
You're right, you know what?

30:27.071 --> 30:28.472
Benny wasn't reformed.

30:28.506 --> 30:30.107
But look at the car
he was driving, Booth.

30:30.141 --> 30:31.875
It couldn't have been worth
more than a grand, tops.

30:31.909 --> 30:33.543
According to forensic
accounting,

30:33.578 --> 30:34.911
he had no money saved up.

30:34.946 --> 30:36.413
Plus he was living
in a repo yard.

30:36.447 --> 30:37.380
What are you saying, all right?

30:37.415 --> 30:38.715
I know he stole those cars.

30:38.749 --> 30:39.983
I'm not doubting
your work, Booth.

30:40.017 --> 30:41.718
But something is
off here, all right?

30:41.752 --> 30:43.987
If Benny was actually stealing
these high-end cars,

30:44.021 --> 30:46.656
why wasn't he making any money?

30:47.992 --> 30:49.526
Huh? Huh?

30:49.560 --> 30:50.994
See, now that's what I do.

30:54.799 --> 30:55.999
Hey.

30:56.033 --> 30:57.134
So, the good news is

30:57.168 --> 30:58.435
is that I was able
to determine

30:58.469 --> 31:00.604
that the chip found
in the septic sludge

31:00.638 --> 31:01.805
and in Benny's rib

31:01.839 --> 31:04.274
came from the same
digital recorder.

31:04.308 --> 31:06.476
His boss made him carry one.
Yeah.

31:06.511 --> 31:07.878
It was the same make
she gave him.

31:07.912 --> 31:09.880
Now, I was able to run
a full diagnostic.

31:09.914 --> 31:11.648
I transferred
all the binary code.

31:11.682 --> 31:13.683
But I was only able to retrieve

31:13.718 --> 31:15.785
this 11-second audio clip.

31:15.820 --> 31:19.122
BENNY: Nah, I can't do this no more.
I just want to work repo

31:19.157 --> 31:21.358
like I'm supposed to.
Stealing cars ain't

31:21.392 --> 31:23.660
what I signed up for.
Hey, what the hell you doing?!

31:23.694 --> 31:25.495
Get off!

31:25.530 --> 31:26.863
Get off of me!

31:26.898 --> 31:29.132
Oh, God, we're gonna...

31:29.167 --> 31:31.968
Is there any audio of the person
who's in the car with him?

31:32.003 --> 31:33.970
No. None that comes through.

31:34.005 --> 31:35.605
Why would Benny record
a conversation

31:35.640 --> 31:37.140
that could be incriminating?

31:37.175 --> 31:39.009
Maybe he thought
it was the only way

31:39.043 --> 31:40.710
to get whoever was
in that car with him

31:40.745 --> 31:42.145
to leave him alone.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.781
I'm thinking it was
his mentor Horatio.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.584
Or his boss who told him
to record everything.

31:47.618 --> 31:49.619
BENNY:
<i>Nah, I can't do this no more.</i>

31:49.654 --> 31:51.855
I just want to work repo
like I'm supposed to.

31:51.889 --> 31:53.823
Stealing cars ain't
what I signed up for.

31:53.858 --> 31:55.392
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?!

31:55.426 --> 31:56.426
Get off!

31:56.460 --> 31:57.694
Get off of me!

31:57.728 --> 32:00.163
Oh, God, we're gonna...

32:00.198 --> 32:02.199
Why you make me listen to that?

32:02.233 --> 32:03.567
I already said

32:03.601 --> 32:05.235
Benny getting killed
is a damn shame.

32:05.269 --> 32:07.704
(laughs) I can see you're
overwhelmed with grief.

32:07.738 --> 32:09.072
You know what?

32:09.106 --> 32:11.141
I didn't like you
the second I saw you.

32:11.175 --> 32:13.109
And you're just getting
uglier by the minute.

32:13.144 --> 32:15.245
Come on, I looked
into your finances.

32:15.279 --> 32:17.847
You're, like, two months max
from going out of business.

32:17.882 --> 32:20.483
That's because the economy's
in recovery, ain't you heard?

32:20.518 --> 32:23.286
Which is fine and dandy
for the rest of the country.

32:23.321 --> 32:25.388
But for us
in the repo game?

32:25.423 --> 32:26.957
Recovery sucks.

32:26.991 --> 32:28.191
Why'd you hire Benny?

32:28.226 --> 32:29.559
You never hired a felon before.

32:29.594 --> 32:31.127
Christian charity a crime now?

32:31.162 --> 32:32.596
See, I think you hired him
because you knew

32:32.630 --> 32:33.830
you can manipulate him
into making you

32:33.864 --> 32:36.299
some extra cash on the side.

32:36.334 --> 32:37.467
But he wanted out...
Excuse me.

32:37.501 --> 32:39.302
You hear my voice on that tape?

32:39.337 --> 32:40.904
You knew he had
the recorder on him.

32:40.938 --> 32:43.240
You were smart enough
not to talk.

32:43.274 --> 32:44.307
You know what?

32:44.342 --> 32:46.176
I am smart enough to know

32:46.210 --> 32:47.877
when to shut my trap.

32:47.912 --> 32:50.981
And I'm shutting it right now.

32:52.000 --> 32:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

33:02.470 --> 33:05.208
You have a delicate touch.

33:05.951 --> 33:09.353
I would prefer to be
alone while I work.

33:09.387 --> 33:11.222
Is the problem with me,

33:11.256 --> 33:12.590
or in your lack of discovery?

33:12.624 --> 33:16.060
Agent Booth has
a suspect, but...

33:16.094 --> 33:17.661
so far, we don't
have enough

33:17.696 --> 33:19.964
physical evidence
to arrest her.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.599
I see.

33:21.633 --> 33:25.269
When I was...
in Cuba,

33:25.303 --> 33:27.638
in charge of
my own facility,

33:27.672 --> 33:30.040
I too would often, um...

33:30.075 --> 33:33.010
oh... <i>¿como se dice?</i>

33:33.044 --> 33:35.412
...let the bones speak to me.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.148
You are delusional
if you think

33:38.183 --> 33:40.651
an inanimate object can speak.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.354
<i>Ay!</i>

33:43.388 --> 33:44.788
I'm sorry.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.657
That shouldn't have happened.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.459
Coming from a land of atheists,

33:48.493 --> 33:51.128
I wouldn't expect you to be
a religious man, Dr. Fuentes.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.596
I <i>am</i> an atheist.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.365
This was my father's.

33:54.399 --> 33:57.668
His religion was taken
from him and his parents,

33:57.702 --> 33:59.470
driven underground...
It was very painful

33:59.504 --> 34:01.639
to them.
But if you don't believe...

34:01.673 --> 34:04.008
I believe in
the right to believe.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.843
That's what
this means.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.178
Eventually, we all
make our own choices.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.681
But we can't make
good decisions

34:10.715 --> 34:12.716
unless we are exposed
to everything.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.818
Can we?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.456
Have I said something wrong?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.559
No.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.462
You are
quite right.

34:26.965 --> 34:30.034
Can you hand me
that scapula, Dr. Fuentes?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.536
But you already examined it.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.004
As have I.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.938
Unfortunately,
there is nothing more

34:35.974 --> 34:37.675
to be learned
from these bones.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.945
(sighs)

34:41.980 --> 34:43.480
You are
correct.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.987
Which is why we have to look
at another set of remains.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.456
But these are
the only remains we have.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.159
Aren't they?

34:55.193 --> 34:56.726
Dr. Brennan!

34:56.761 --> 34:59.430
Dr. Brennan!

34:59.464 --> 35:01.224
BRENNAN: So far, we have only
concentrated on

35:01.232 --> 35:02.700
the injuries found
on the victim.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.268
What we failed to consider

35:04.302 --> 35:06.870
were the fractures the killer
must have sustained.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.105
FUENTES:
That's brilliant.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.340
But you already
know that.

35:09.374 --> 35:11.254
MONTENEGRO: Based on the damage
done to the car,

35:11.276 --> 35:13.043
I extrapolated the speed to be

35:13.078 --> 35:16.146
approximately 25 miles
per hour on impact.

35:16.181 --> 35:19.049
From the unilateral fracturing
to the left side of the body,

35:19.084 --> 35:20.884
we know the victim
was facing the killer.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.320
BRENNAN:
And likely struggling with her.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.888
Which means the killer was
also facing the victim.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.156
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.692
And what about seat belts?

35:28.727 --> 35:29.960
On the windshield,

35:29.994 --> 35:31.328
radial fracturing suggests that

35:31.363 --> 35:32.863
the killer's head made contact.
Okay,

35:32.897 --> 35:34.665
so no seat belts.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.602
All right,
you ready?

35:41.673 --> 35:42.873
MONTENEGRO:
(exhales) Okay.

35:42.907 --> 35:45.042
I am always buckling up.

35:45.076 --> 35:47.144
These injuries represent the
minimal amount of fracturing

35:47.178 --> 35:50.114
that could be sustained
to a healthy adult passenger.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.548
Possible fractures

35:51.583 --> 35:52.883
to the right side
of the body,

35:52.917 --> 35:54.118
frontal bone,

35:54.152 --> 35:55.586
ribs, ulna
and radius.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.554
I've seen these before, in Cuba,

35:57.589 --> 36:00.557
since so many of our cars
have no air bags.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.792
But a month has gone by.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.093
It's not likely Georgia Grace

36:03.128 --> 36:04.328
would exhibit any outward signs

36:04.362 --> 36:06.130
of having been in an accident.
And yet,

36:06.164 --> 36:08.499
underneath her skin, the bone
could still be remodeling.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.834
There could be
some debris

36:10.869 --> 36:12.870
imbedded under her flesh
or even in bone.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.838
Meaning that if we got
an X ray of the killer,

36:14.873 --> 36:16.140
then we got her.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.574
Yes.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.147
Georgia Grace volunteered
to get X-rayed.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.381
She's clean.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.116
What about Horatio?
Nothing.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.384
You got something?

36:27.419 --> 36:28.819
I don't know.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.221
I'm probably reaching,
but... okay.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.757
I was rereading, uh,
the parole officer's notes,

36:33.792 --> 36:35.592
um, 'cause I
wanted to understand

36:35.627 --> 36:37.194
Benny's state of mind
before he was murdered, right?

36:37.228 --> 36:39.763
Right. So that's good,
you have something, then.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.065
Maybe.
Do you have the list

36:42.100 --> 36:44.001
of the cars that you
suspect Benny stole?

36:44.035 --> 36:45.669
Um... list of cars...

36:45.703 --> 36:47.404
Right here. List.
Okay.

36:47.439 --> 36:50.240
What are the dates
that they were stolen?

36:50.275 --> 36:52.943
Uh, March 3,
March 8,

36:52.977 --> 36:54.411
May 23rd.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.646
(laughs)

36:55.680 --> 36:57.448
Okay, maybe I
wasn't reaching.

36:57.482 --> 37:00.517
All of those days
correspond to the dates

37:00.552 --> 37:02.653
that Benny met with
his parole officer.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.755
That's it.

37:04.789 --> 37:06.657
Fowler forced Benny
to steal those cars.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.051
And if he didn't, he threatened
to throw him back into jail.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.294
Exactly.

37:10.328 --> 37:11.829
And he knew that if
Benny got caught,

37:11.863 --> 37:13.897
it would all come down
on Benny, not him.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.332
It was a sweet scam.

37:15.366 --> 37:16.951
Fowler is not gonna
get away with this.

37:16.976 --> 37:18.001
No.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.937
You don't have enough proof
to arrest him, Booth.

37:19.971 --> 37:22.840
Plus, he's smart enough
not to submit to an X ray.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.875
I don't have to arrest him,
I just have to bring him in

37:24.909 --> 37:26.143
and ask him a few questions.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.278
Bones, I need your help.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.320
Officer Fowler.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.955
Thanks for coming in.
Appreciate it.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.823
Oh. Sure. You get
some new information?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.859
Yeah, pieces of the puzzle,
you know, you understand.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.327
The tough part is
putting it all together.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.595
Yeah, well,
whatever I can do.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.029
Like I said, I...
it's tough

37:46.064 --> 37:47.231
to lose a guy I was
responsible for.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.599
I can only imagine.
Yeah.

37:48.633 --> 37:49.733
Sorry about going
through security,

37:49.767 --> 37:51.335
but even us good
guys gotta do it.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.803
At least I don't have
to take my shoes off.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.171
Ooh, that
would stink.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.772
(beeps)

37:55.807 --> 37:57.975
(quietly): The backscatter X-ray
is low resolution,

37:58.009 --> 37:59.576
so there's very
little detail.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.645
That's fine.

38:03.481 --> 38:06.016
(whirring)

38:08.853 --> 38:10.087
You got him?

38:11.890 --> 38:15.592
The radiation just reflects
off the target,

38:15.627 --> 38:17.227
it doesn't pass through.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.698
Look, I just need
a yes or a no, Bones.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.536
I need another pass.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.037
Then maybe I can enhance it.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.006
Hey, Agent Booth,
what's the problem here?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.108
Oh, a technical thing,
right, with the machine?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.442
You know these
government issue things.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.177
Okay, well, my badge
should be enough.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.847
Just relax,
we'll be right with you.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.385
I'm using a program
Angela developed.

38:41.419 --> 38:45.822
It decreases statistical noise
and increases resolution.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.135
BOOTH: All right,
so he's clean?

38:58.169 --> 38:59.536
Wait.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.372
There's faint
evidence of fracturing

39:02.407 --> 39:04.508
along the coronal suture.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.643
And Dr. Fuentes was right.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.979
There's metal and glass
imbedded in the scalp.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.316
Dr. Hodgins can match it to
the make and model of the car.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.318
Hey, what the hell is going on?
They won't let me out of here.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.552
Okay, no, just let him out.

39:15.587 --> 39:16.954
Thanks.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.355
Sorry about that.
Yeah, no worries.

39:18.389 --> 39:19.790
Hey, turn around.
What-what are you doing?

39:19.824 --> 39:21.725
You're under arrest for murder.
What?

39:21.759 --> 39:24.227
You've got it wrong.
BRENNAN: You murdered Benny Jerguson,

39:24.262 --> 39:26.496
Officer Fowler.
I don't get things wrong.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.931
I really appreciate
you coming down here

39:27.966 --> 39:29.766
and helping us out.
Really means a lot.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.869
You really were
a big help.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.445
FUENTES: What a wonderful aroma.
Oh.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.680
What are you doing in here?
Oh, man.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.048
I wanted it to be a surprise,

39:45.083 --> 39:46.404
after you finished
your paperwork.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.251
Come.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.120
Voila.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.989
No...

39:52.023 --> 39:53.624
Ropa vieja.
Yeah.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.325
I had to improvise a little bit,

39:55.360 --> 39:57.060
but luckily a double-neck boiler

39:57.095 --> 39:58.528
is perfect
for sous vide.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.796
Oh...

39:59.831 --> 40:01.098
Smells just like my father's.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.635
So I read up on the dish.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.371
As you know, <i>ropa vieja</i>
means "old clothes."

40:07.405 --> 40:09.373
Well, the name comes
from an old wives' tale.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.774
A poor man

40:10.808 --> 40:13.110
must cook a meal for
his whole family...

40:13.144 --> 40:14.811
Only he has nothing to serve.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.147
So he gathers up
his old clothes,

40:17.181 --> 40:18.715
imbues them with love,

40:18.750 --> 40:21.151
and they miraculously
turn into stew.

40:21.185 --> 40:22.653
The family is fed.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.054
Yeah.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.689
I thought it might be a nice way

40:25.723 --> 40:27.391
to welcome you
to our little family.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.260
Listen, I know you want
to be an American now,

40:30.294 --> 40:32.596
but I figured you might
miss a few things.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.234
Well... (sighs)

40:37.268 --> 40:40.003
You know, if I could've stayed,
I would.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.640
It's my home.

40:44.709 --> 40:47.711
And it will be again, one day.

40:47.745 --> 40:50.580
Well, until then...

40:50.615 --> 40:53.617
Until then,
I will become

40:53.651 --> 40:55.852
a famous and
rich American.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.121
And be grateful
for my new friend,

40:58.156 --> 41:02.025
who, just for
a moment,

41:02.060 --> 41:04.161
has brought me home.

41:05.363 --> 41:07.497
Cheers.

41:07.532 --> 41:09.700
<i>Salud.</i>

41:12.804 --> 41:14.571
No, no...

41:14.605 --> 41:16.973
(speaking Spanish)

41:17.008 --> 41:19.509
(laughs)

41:20.478 --> 41:21.812
Okay.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.447
Christine is out.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.116
She's sleeping
like an angel.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.484
Did you call her an angel

41:27.518 --> 41:29.152
because you want her
to go to church?

41:29.187 --> 41:30.554
What? No.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.723
I called her an angel
because she is one.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.125
I think she should go.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.693
What?

41:36.728 --> 41:38.595
Christine.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.830
To church.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.431
Really? Whoa, whoa.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.734
Wait a second, now. Why?

41:43.768 --> 41:46.002
Because she can.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.105
While I personally
don't believe in God,

41:48.139 --> 41:49.372
myths can have

41:49.407 --> 41:51.641
a very beneficial
effect on children.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.177
What if she doesn't
think it's a myth?

41:54.212 --> 41:55.846
Well, she is my
daughter, Booth.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.581
I trust her to come
to a rational decision

41:57.615 --> 41:58.815
once she has all
the information.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.084
Wow, who would've
thought, huh?

42:01.119 --> 42:02.886
Compromise.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.757
I look at it as
an exercise in freedom.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.425
Hmm.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.027
You're not saying this
because of, uh, Dr. Cuba?

42:11.062 --> 42:12.529
A bit, yes.

42:12.563 --> 42:14.097
He asked you to sleep
with him again?

42:14.132 --> 42:15.532
No.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.234
I'm sure he
still wants to.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.435
(sighs)

42:18.469 --> 42:20.370
But as long as I have you...
Uh-huh.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.842
I would, however,
also like to take Christine

42:25.877 --> 42:27.244
to the Natural History Museum

42:27.278 --> 42:28.578
on Sundays after church.

42:28.613 --> 42:29.363
Is that the place
with the dinosaurs?

42:29.364 --> 42:29.797
Yeah.

42:29.822 --> 42:31.356
Who wouldn't want
to go there, right?

42:31.849 --> 42:33.884
She's gonna love
my T rex imitation.

42:33.918 --> 42:36.153
(snorting, snarling)
Oh!

42:36.187 --> 42:39.122
Rar!
(laughs)

42:39.157 --> 42:40.857
Oh-ho, Mrs. Cavewoman,

42:40.892 --> 42:43.226
I'm gonna pick you up
with my tiny, little arms

42:43.261 --> 42:45.362
in my tiny, little hands!

42:45.396 --> 42:46.797
(snarling)
You can't tell Christine

42:46.831 --> 42:49.566
that early man and
dinosaurs coexisted.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.368
Mrs. Flintstone,
you have no choice.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.370
(snarls)
(laughing)

42:53.404 --> 42:57.422
T. rex attacks, right there...
We're gonna wake up Christine!
