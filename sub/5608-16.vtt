00:05.518 --> 00:08.118
<i>The Times</i> wants an interview
regarding

00:08.119 --> 00:09.720
the new Critical
Response Command.

00:09.722 --> 00:12.556
Refer them to the Chief
of Counterterrorism. Thank you.

00:12.558 --> 00:13.724
They want you.

00:13.726 --> 00:15.292
They're lucky if
anyone in this department

00:15.294 --> 00:17.394
talks to 'em after
that hack job they did

00:17.396 --> 00:19.563
on excessive force in the NYPD.

00:19.565 --> 00:21.165
That was a different reporter.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.300
And I wasn't aware
that you read <i>The Times.</i>

00:23.302 --> 00:24.568
I do. For laughs.

00:24.570 --> 00:25.836
What's next?
City Council

00:25.838 --> 00:28.439
Speaker Thomas
was sworn in yesterday.

00:28.441 --> 00:30.174
Oh, another cop-hater.

00:30.176 --> 00:32.543
Here's an idea:
let's limit these briefings

00:32.545 --> 00:34.611
to “things that Frank
doesn't know.”

00:34.613 --> 00:37.548
Her press conference after
was about how her top priority

00:37.550 --> 00:39.883
is dismantling
our Broken Windows policy.

00:39.885 --> 00:42.486
She's been a broken record
about that for years.

00:42.488 --> 00:45.355
As a councilwoman.
Now she's the Speaker.

00:45.357 --> 00:46.724
Now she has muscle.

00:46.726 --> 00:49.593
We base our decisions
on the Broken Windows paradigm.

00:49.595 --> 00:51.729
The moment someone tells me
I can't

00:51.731 --> 00:53.897
is the moment I'm out of here.
Period.

00:53.899 --> 00:55.699
There's no doubt
that poor

00:55.701 --> 00:57.901
and minority neighborhoods
are being singled out

00:57.903 --> 01:00.571
in the enforcement
of minor offenses.

01:00.573 --> 01:02.973
Only because that's where
most of the offenses occur.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.641
But you can't say that.
I just did.

01:04.643 --> 01:05.642
I mean he can't.

01:05.644 --> 01:06.877
I will,

01:06.879 --> 01:08.846
if she pushes me.
Look, it's her own constituents

01:08.848 --> 01:11.582
that'll be hurt the most
if we look the other way.

01:11.584 --> 01:12.750
Well, she is.

01:12.752 --> 01:15.652
Pushing. Legislation
that will decriminalize

01:15.654 --> 01:17.488
several lower-level offenses.

01:17.490 --> 01:18.989
She's proposed
that bill before

01:18.991 --> 01:20.691
and lost, handily.

01:20.693 --> 01:21.658
To review:

01:21.660 --> 01:23.527
Now she's the Speaker.

01:23.529 --> 01:25.462
Now she has muscle.

01:25.464 --> 01:27.431
So do I.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.799
You don't want
to go to war

01:28.801 --> 01:30.801
with the new Speaker
her first week in office.

01:30.803 --> 01:34.204
Let me set up a meeting,
find common ground.

01:34.206 --> 01:36.373
If there were common ground
between the speaker and me,

01:36.375 --> 01:38.308
we would have found it
a long time ago.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.377
“Talk first. Fight last.”

01:40.379 --> 01:42.112
Frank Reagan.

01:42.114 --> 01:43.480
You do say that, boss.

01:45.518 --> 01:46.717
Fine.

01:47.553 --> 01:49.319
Set up a meeting
with the Speaker.

01:49.321 --> 01:50.587
And you'll play nice?

01:50.589 --> 01:54.792
Right up until nice
doesn't work.

01:57.663 --> 01:59.496
Thank you for coming,
Attorney General Schneiderman.

01:59.498 --> 02:01.565
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Your Honor.

02:02.935 --> 02:05.135
Good to see you, Erin.
Nice to see you, sir.

02:06.572 --> 02:07.571
Oh, Zach.

02:07.573 --> 02:09.406
I can't believe she's gone.

02:09.407 --> 02:11.675
That makes two of us.

02:11.677 --> 02:13.110
How are the kids holding up?

02:13.112 --> 02:15.145
Ellen was a wonderful mother.

02:15.147 --> 02:16.446
They depended
on her.

02:16.448 --> 02:17.815
We all did.
I hear

02:17.817 --> 02:20.450
they charged the driver
that caused the accident.

02:20.452 --> 02:24.087
His blood alcohol level
was twice the legal limit.

02:24.089 --> 02:26.156
His third DWI.

02:26.158 --> 02:28.225
You know, when I first started

02:28.227 --> 02:30.694
working at the
DA's Office for you,

02:30.696 --> 02:32.029
Ellen used to
bring me sandwiches.

02:32.031 --> 02:34.097
She used to tell me
that I was too skinny.

02:35.434 --> 02:36.867
Me, too.

02:36.869 --> 02:39.770
Then when I became a judge,
she started bringing salads.

02:39.772 --> 02:41.905
Told me I was getting fat
sitting around all day.

02:44.376 --> 02:46.043
Do you need anything?

02:46.045 --> 02:48.312
I'm okay, Erin.

02:48.314 --> 02:50.814
I hear that you didn't postpone
the sentencing hearing

02:50.816 --> 02:51.949
for this afternoon.

02:51.951 --> 02:53.984
I thought you might
take some time off.

02:54.854 --> 02:57.221
I need to work.

02:57.223 --> 03:01.124
Once the kids go home
and the dust clears...

03:01.126 --> 03:03.126
it's just gonna be me.

03:03.128 --> 03:05.863
A lot of people love you,
including me.

03:05.865 --> 03:07.598
You're not alone.

Hey.

03:19.311 --> 03:20.141
Thanks for coming, Danny.

03:20.165 --> 03:22.437
Look, I know you're pissed
I told Sean

03:22.648 --> 03:24.140
he could keep playing hockey,
but can't we just...

03:24.164 --> 03:24.848
I am.

03:24.850 --> 03:26.116
But that's not why
I asked you to come here.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.150
Hi, Maria.

03:27.152 --> 03:29.052
Hey. What's going on?

03:29.054 --> 03:31.822
Uh, one of the accountants here

03:31.824 --> 03:33.757
is having trouble
with her ex-husband.

03:33.759 --> 03:35.225
Linda, we can't
just get involved...

03:35.227 --> 03:38.195
Her name is Lori D'Angelo,
and she's a friend of mine.

03:38.197 --> 03:41.298
Can we talk to her?
Mm-hmm.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.635
Lori, we're Detectives
Reagan and Baez.

03:45.938 --> 03:48.705
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

03:50.109 --> 03:51.942
Why don't you tell us
what's going on.

03:51.944 --> 03:54.077
Well, I've been divorced
for a year.

03:54.079 --> 03:56.713
My ex can't let go.

03:56.715 --> 03:57.614
What's his name?

03:57.616 --> 03:59.116
Ronald D'Angelo.

03:59.118 --> 04:00.751
He's not a bad guy.

04:00.753 --> 04:04.288
He just keeps stopping by
and watching the building.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.256
It-It's not fair to us.

04:06.258 --> 04:07.791
Who's “us”?
Our son,

04:07.793 --> 04:09.793
Matthew. He's nine.

04:09.795 --> 04:11.795
Ronnie has visitation rights.

04:11.797 --> 04:13.897
I've put up with his
behavior in the past

04:13.899 --> 04:15.632
for Matthew's sake, but...

04:15.634 --> 04:17.834
then I started dating Paul.

04:17.836 --> 04:18.869
And Ronnie didn't like that.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.370
He freaked out.

04:20.372 --> 04:23.674
He, um, started taking Matthew
without asking

04:23.676 --> 04:25.042
and making threats.

04:25.044 --> 04:26.343
I just...

04:26.345 --> 04:29.446
Did you file a complaint?

04:30.616 --> 04:32.416
Well, I-I didn't want to get
the police involved,

04:32.418 --> 04:33.750
but...

04:33.752 --> 04:36.620
well, after last night...

04:36.622 --> 04:38.889
Ronnie and Paul
got into a big argument.

04:38.891 --> 04:40.223
It was awful.

04:40.225 --> 04:42.259
And Matthew saw all of it.

04:42.261 --> 04:44.728
This is
a very unfortunate situation.

04:44.730 --> 04:45.497
I'm just not sure that we...

04:45.521 --> 04:46.898
Why don't you tell us
where we can find

04:46.899 --> 04:49.199
your husband. We'll talk to him.

04:52.271 --> 04:54.237
Thank you, Detectives.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.375
Mr. Greer, you've been
convicted of assault.

04:58.377 --> 05:01.211
The court will now consider
your sentence.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.846
Counsel?

05:02.848 --> 05:05.549
My client deeply regrets
his actions, Your Honor.

05:05.551 --> 05:07.617
He has no criminal record,
and his wife

05:07.619 --> 05:10.654
has taken responsibility
for her role in the incident.

05:10.656 --> 05:14.491
We request the court show
leniency in this matter.

05:14.493 --> 05:15.792
Ms. Reagan?

05:15.794 --> 05:17.894
The People have
no objection.

05:18.764 --> 05:21.231
Mr. Greer, if I go easy on you,

05:21.233 --> 05:23.233
will you promise
not to do it again?

05:23.235 --> 05:24.868
Yes, Your Honor.

05:25.704 --> 05:27.504
When you married your wife,

05:27.506 --> 05:29.873
did you promise to honor
and cherish her?

05:31.110 --> 05:33.010
Don't look
at your lawyer.

05:33.012 --> 05:34.611
Did you make that promise?

05:34.613 --> 05:36.213
Yes, sir.

05:36.215 --> 05:37.581
Then you committed violence
against her.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.549
You broke that promise.

05:39.551 --> 05:42.853
So why should I believe
you'll keep your promise to me?

05:42.855 --> 05:44.454
Your Honor...
I hereby

05:44.456 --> 05:46.189
sentence you
to the maximum sentence

05:46.191 --> 05:48.525
of seven years in state prison.

05:48.527 --> 05:49.893
We're adjourned.

Okay.

06:38.671 --> 06:40.237
Madam Speaker.

06:40.239 --> 06:42.540
It sounds so good
when you say it.

06:42.542 --> 06:45.209
Congratulations on your inauguration.
Thank you.

06:45.211 --> 06:46.644
We are all looking forward
to working

06:46.646 --> 06:48.012
with the council going forward.

06:48.014 --> 06:51.348
Wow. You said that
so convincingly

06:51.350 --> 06:53.217
I actually
almost believed you.

06:53.219 --> 06:55.052
But keep working on it.

06:55.054 --> 06:56.320
Shall we sit?

06:56.322 --> 06:57.521
Sure.

06:59.425 --> 07:01.659
We'll take it from here,
Garrett.

07:01.661 --> 07:03.527
I'm happy to stay.

07:05.431 --> 07:07.464
Well, here's to...

07:07.466 --> 07:10.267
a constructive dialogue.

07:15.541 --> 07:18.275
I think he thinks
we need a chaperone.

07:18.277 --> 07:19.777
Or a referee.

07:19.779 --> 07:22.012
You know, I got to tell you,
I like this couch.

07:22.014 --> 07:24.949
It's kind of nice. I bet you get
a lot of great power naps

07:24.951 --> 07:26.517
on this bad boy.

07:28.621 --> 07:31.422
Look, Regina,

07:31.424 --> 07:35.993
I know that we haven't
always agreed in the past...

07:35.995 --> 07:38.395
We have never agreed about
anything in the past.

07:38.397 --> 07:41.498
The point is I've
always respected your opinion,

07:41.500 --> 07:43.400
and I hope you can respect mine.

07:43.402 --> 07:45.636
Oh, I do. Depending
on what it is.

07:45.638 --> 07:47.605
Okay.

07:47.607 --> 07:50.975
Decriminalizing
quality-of-life crimes

07:50.977 --> 07:53.577
is a huge mistake.

07:53.579 --> 07:56.447
I would think the cops
would be thrilled not to have

07:56.449 --> 07:59.583
to arrest everyone who drinks
a beer on their own stoop.

07:59.585 --> 08:03.487
Look, Broken Windows
is an essential part

08:03.489 --> 08:05.789
of the fabric
that protects this city.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.792
You can't just cherry-pick
and pull threads,

08:08.794 --> 08:10.527
or the whole thing unravels.

08:10.529 --> 08:13.464
It's an excuse for the NYPD

08:13.466 --> 08:16.033
to intrude on the private lives
of its citizens.

08:16.035 --> 08:16.901
And you know it.

08:16.903 --> 08:19.036
No, I do not.
Yes, you do.

08:19.038 --> 08:21.872
And now you're trying to tell me
that harassing people

08:21.874 --> 08:24.708
for jaywalking
keeps the city safe.

08:24.710 --> 08:27.278
Yeah. And I've got the numbers
to prove it.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.647
I have the numbers that say,
in minority neighborhoods,

08:29.649 --> 08:31.615
they're starting
to get a little tired

08:31.617 --> 08:33.884
of constantly being
hassled by the police.

08:33.885 --> 08:36.086
Then tell them to try
obeying the law.

08:36.087 --> 08:38.087
Everybody who's hassled by
the police is breaking the law?

08:38.090 --> 08:39.155
I don't think so.

08:39.158 --> 08:41.759
My people risk their lives
every day

08:41.760 --> 08:43.594
to keep your neighborhood safe.

08:43.596 --> 08:44.595
Safe?

08:44.597 --> 08:46.430
Animals in the zoo are safe.

08:46.432 --> 08:48.666
But it's not
a really good way to live.

08:48.668 --> 08:49.967
Come on, Regina, don't...

08:49.969 --> 08:52.069
My people don't trust
the police.

08:52.071 --> 08:53.704
This is an issue for you.

08:53.706 --> 08:55.139
Why don't you see this?

08:56.542 --> 08:59.810
Maybe you need to fix
the police's broken windows

08:59.812 --> 09:02.279
before you start trying to fix
broken windows everywhere else.

09:02.281 --> 09:03.948
I don't even know
what that means.

09:03.950 --> 09:06.116
You don't? Really?

09:07.420 --> 09:09.219
The city council

09:09.221 --> 09:11.188
defers to you on matters
of public safety, yes?

09:11.190 --> 09:13.157
I offer advice when called upon.

09:13.159 --> 09:14.291
You call the shots,

09:14.293 --> 09:16.260
and you win all the time.

09:16.262 --> 09:18.362
I'd like to think the city wins.

09:18.364 --> 09:20.064
Yeah, I know you'd like
to think that,

09:20.066 --> 09:21.165
but I don't think that.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.466
I'd like the city council

09:22.468 --> 09:25.102
returned to the people
it's supposed to protect.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.574
You've tried this before.

09:30.576 --> 09:33.143
And failed.

09:33.946 --> 09:35.713
Yeah.

09:35.715 --> 09:38.549
But now...

09:38.551 --> 09:40.050
I got the numbers

09:40.052 --> 09:41.518
and a gavel.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.220
Don't get up.

09:45.291 --> 09:48.559
I wore a uniform
in the bad old days,

09:48.561 --> 09:50.527
and we are not going back there.

09:50.529 --> 09:51.829
Not on my watch.

09:51.831 --> 09:55.666
And the NYPD will not continue
to treat ordinary citizens

09:55.668 --> 09:57.368
like common criminals.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.870
Not on <i>my</i> watch.

09:59.872 --> 10:02.039
Commissioner.

10:09.015 --> 10:10.948
I took my son
to the Ranger game,

10:10.950 --> 10:12.249
and then I took him home,

10:12.251 --> 10:15.085
and my wife, Lori,
had this guy over there.

10:15.087 --> 10:16.987
You mean her boyfriend,
Paul Rossi.

10:16.989 --> 10:18.355
Yeah, whatever.

10:18.357 --> 10:19.990
The officers said
you threatened him.

10:19.992 --> 10:21.992
Like I said, I got upset.

10:21.994 --> 10:23.827
He say something
to set you off?

10:23.829 --> 10:26.296
Lori told me they
might be getting married.

10:26.298 --> 10:28.365
Uh-huh. Bet you didn't
want to hear that.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.367
I love my wife.

10:31.203 --> 10:33.604
Lori's not your wife anymore.

10:33.606 --> 10:35.072
Divorce is a sin.

10:35.074 --> 10:38.142
Yeah, well, so is
harassing your ex-wife.

10:38.144 --> 10:39.476
Okay? Look,
we're both Catholic.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.845
We get it, but you got
to knock it off.

10:41.847 --> 10:43.680
Let me just show you this.

10:43.682 --> 10:47.451
You know, I'm not perfect...

10:47.453 --> 10:50.054
but I'm a good husband.

10:50.056 --> 10:51.922
I'm a good dad.

10:51.924 --> 10:54.925
Okay, it's time to stop
looking backwards, okay?

10:54.927 --> 10:56.527
Lori's moved on
with her life.

10:56.529 --> 10:57.961
You need to do the same.

10:57.963 --> 11:01.065
The Bible says,
“What God joins together,

11:01.067 --> 11:03.400
man can't separate.”

11:03.402 --> 11:05.602
I believe that.

11:05.604 --> 11:09.306
A family is not something
that you just throw away.

11:09.308 --> 11:12.743
Neither is the rest
of your life, so back off.

11:12.745 --> 11:14.711
You got it?

11:14.713 --> 11:16.947
Yeah, got it.

11:18.184 --> 11:21.518
<i>I was going through</i>
<i>some stuff at the house.</i>

11:21.520 --> 11:22.953
Came across this.

11:22.955 --> 11:23.921
Wow.

11:23.923 --> 11:26.356
It's the day
I won my first case.

11:26.358 --> 11:28.125
How come I got older,
and you didn't?

11:28.127 --> 11:29.927
Oh, right.
And now you've got

11:29.929 --> 11:33.197
my job, and I'm a
crusty old judge.

11:33.199 --> 11:36.834
Well, you were definitely
a little crusty today.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.571
Oh, you think
my sentence

11:40.573 --> 11:42.706
in the Greer matter
was too harsh?

11:42.708 --> 11:44.942
I would never
question your judgment.

11:44.944 --> 11:47.244
But?
There's no excuse

11:47.246 --> 11:49.113
for domestic violence, ever,

11:49.115 --> 11:52.416
but the maximum sentence
on a first-time offender?

11:54.487 --> 11:56.520
I've been on this bench
for seven years now.

11:56.522 --> 11:59.056
I've watched a parade
of violent offenders

11:59.058 --> 12:00.491
march into my courtroom,

12:00.493 --> 12:03.494
begging forgiveness
for the damage they've caused.

12:03.496 --> 12:05.762
You've always been a big fan
of forgiveness.

12:05.764 --> 12:07.764
Unfortunately, people tend

12:07.766 --> 12:10.767
to mistake mercy for approval.

12:10.769 --> 12:13.470
Giving offenders
like Mitchell Greer a pass only

12:13.472 --> 12:17.107
encourages them to go out
and do the same thing again.

12:17.109 --> 12:18.976
Or something worse.

12:18.978 --> 12:21.278
Some people do learn
from their mistakes.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.313
Yes.

12:23.315 --> 12:25.382
But those who don't...

12:25.384 --> 12:27.417
ruin lives.

12:27.419 --> 12:30.087
I won't be a part of that.

12:30.089 --> 12:32.289
Not anymore.

12:37.730 --> 12:39.863
Ronnie, you need
to leave us alone.

12:39.865 --> 12:42.332
You can't marry this guy!
You destroyed our family!

12:42.334 --> 12:44.101
We're not a family
anymore, Ronnie!

12:44.103 --> 12:45.802
Let's just calm down, okay?

12:45.804 --> 12:47.137
Mind your own business!

12:47.139 --> 12:48.605
This is my business!
Come on!

12:48.607 --> 12:49.773
Come on.

12:49.775 --> 12:51.975
They're really
getting married.

12:51.977 --> 12:53.977
Yeah, I heard,
and I'm sorry about that.

12:53.979 --> 12:55.746
But you can't keep
doing this, okay?

12:55.748 --> 12:58.515
I'm fighting for my family!
This ain't the way to do it!

12:58.517 --> 13:00.551
Without them, I got nothin'.
Detective, I am nothin'.

13:00.553 --> 13:03.053
Yeah, well, things could get
worse, you don't knock it off.

13:03.055 --> 13:05.522
Get me a radio from the car.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.760
It's okay, it's okay.

13:12.831 --> 13:15.332
No!
Hey. Hey!

13:15.334 --> 13:17.634
No!

13:17.636 --> 13:20.103
Get your hands off me!

13:20.105 --> 13:21.638
What should we do
with him, Detective?

13:23.709 --> 13:25.442
Lock him up for harassment.

13:31.317 --> 13:33.584
Maybe this'll teach him
a lesson.

13:33.586 --> 13:35.719
I doubt it.

13:44.247 --> 13:47.226
Would it kill you to hold
back a little just once?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.233
I did!

13:48.234 --> 13:49.433
Not according to Speaker Thomas!

13:49.435 --> 13:50.901
Oh, the world according
to Speaker Thomas?

13:50.903 --> 13:52.937
You really gonna
go with that, Garrett?

13:52.939 --> 13:54.171
She's allowed
to have her opinion, Frank,

13:54.173 --> 13:55.339
whether you like it or not.

13:55.341 --> 13:56.573
You saw the way
she came in here,

13:56.575 --> 13:57.741
loaded for bear.

13:57.743 --> 13:59.410
It was straight downhill after that.
Upshot is

13:59.412 --> 14:01.011
now she's gonna
fast-track her bill

14:01.013 --> 14:02.413
to dismantle Broken Windows.

14:02.415 --> 14:03.914
Well, not because of me.

14:03.916 --> 14:05.316
Well, you sure didn't
help your cause.

14:05.318 --> 14:06.450
Well, what was I supposed to do?

14:06.452 --> 14:08.686
Smile and nod and say,
“Right you are?”

14:08.688 --> 14:10.788
Now she's scheduled a public
hearing on policing in the hood.

14:10.790 --> 14:13.590
It's gonna be a greatest-hits
compilation of NYPD overreach.

14:13.592 --> 14:15.459
Well, I'm not going.

14:15.461 --> 14:16.660
You can't go!

14:17.964 --> 14:19.997
But we do need a counter.
Like what?

14:19.999 --> 14:21.832
<i>The New York Times</i>
has been hounding me

14:21.834 --> 14:22.933
for a one-on-one with you.

14:22.935 --> 14:24.335
Fox in the henhouse.
No!

14:24.337 --> 14:27.071
Roger at Metro desk.
He covers us fair and square.

14:27.073 --> 14:30.541
Straight interview-- PC explains
why the policy works.

14:30.543 --> 14:32.042
Softballs only.

14:32.044 --> 14:33.410
I can guarantee it.

14:33.412 --> 14:36.747
The last thing Metro desk wants
is to lose access to One PP.

14:36.749 --> 14:37.982
Set it up.

14:37.984 --> 14:39.350
No ad hominem attacks
on the speaker.

14:39.352 --> 14:41.552
Stick to theory and procedure.

14:48.627 --> 14:50.194
Excuse me, Ms. Reagan?

14:50.196 --> 14:52.196
Elliot, you can
call me Erin.

14:52.198 --> 14:54.031
Sure, right.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.699
Um, sorry to bother you.

14:55.701 --> 14:58.635
It's just, uh, I'm in the middle
of my first solo case.

14:58.637 --> 15:00.070
Yeah, the meth dealer
from the Bronx?

15:00.072 --> 15:01.638
How's that going?
Well...

15:01.640 --> 15:04.842
Um, you know,
yup, pretty well, I think.

15:04.844 --> 15:06.844
Um, at least it was.

15:06.846 --> 15:09.847
What's the problem?
Well, it's-its not a problem, per Se.

15:09.849 --> 15:11.181
The judge just threw out

15:11.183 --> 15:13.083
a key piece of evidence
for the defense.

15:13.085 --> 15:15.452
Well, that sounds
like a good thing.

15:15.454 --> 15:17.121
Right, sure.

15:17.123 --> 15:20.124
It's just this evidence
is potentially exculpatory.

15:20.126 --> 15:21.492
It kind of proves

15:21.494 --> 15:22.960
the defendant wasn't part

15:22.962 --> 15:24.428
of this drug transaction.

15:24.430 --> 15:26.697
Well, why did the judge
toss out the evidence?

15:26.699 --> 15:29.533
He didn't really
explain his ruling at all.

15:29.535 --> 15:31.068
Did the defense object?

15:31.070 --> 15:34.271
Strenuously, and when
I supported their objection,

15:34.273 --> 15:36.807
the judge was... not happy.

15:36.809 --> 15:39.243
He said I was a disgrace

15:39.245 --> 15:40.911
to the DA's Office.

15:40.913 --> 15:42.312
In open court.

15:42.314 --> 15:43.981
What's the name of the judge?

15:43.983 --> 15:45.916
Uh, Judge Wilson.

15:51.190 --> 15:53.190
I have a right
to move on with my life,

15:53.192 --> 15:55.626
to be happy
without being terrorized.

15:55.628 --> 15:58.228
Of course you do.

15:58.230 --> 16:00.764
Maybe it's not
my place, but

16:00.766 --> 16:03.500
I do think
Ronnie's just afraid.

16:03.502 --> 16:06.637
Afraid that your fiancé is gonna
take his place

16:06.639 --> 16:07.805
as Matthew's dad.

16:07.807 --> 16:10.441
That's crazy.
Matty loves his father.

16:10.443 --> 16:14.611
I have never said a bad word
about him, and I never will.

16:14.613 --> 16:18.082
Have you filed
for an order of protection yet?

16:18.084 --> 16:21.385
Not yet.

16:21.387 --> 16:23.854
But I feel like I have no choice.
You have

16:23.856 --> 16:26.523
every right to. Ronnie's way
out of line here, but

16:26.525 --> 16:30.094
there may be another way
to go before you file.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.895
What's that?

16:31.897 --> 16:33.864
I think if you talk to Ronnie,

16:33.866 --> 16:35.499
and you just
let him know

16:35.501 --> 16:37.835
that he's gonna remain a part
of his son's life,

16:37.837 --> 16:40.003
I think that could go
a long way.

16:40.005 --> 16:42.172
You really think
that is gonna make a difference?

16:42.174 --> 16:44.374
I think it's worth a shot.

16:45.811 --> 16:48.312
He's outside with my partner.

16:48.314 --> 16:50.881
You could talk to him,

16:50.883 --> 16:54.518
and if you like
what he has to say, okay.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.153
And if you don't, you file.

16:56.155 --> 16:58.522
I don't know. I don't...

16:58.524 --> 17:00.157
We'll be right here.

17:00.159 --> 17:02.292
Nothing's gonna happen.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.233
Okay.

17:12.037 --> 17:14.204
Send him in.

17:15.508 --> 17:16.906
For what it's worth,

17:16.909 --> 17:18.876
he seems like a decent guy.

17:18.877 --> 17:20.743
He is.

17:29.088 --> 17:31.321
I'm sorry, Lori. I...

17:32.858 --> 17:35.159
I don't want it
to be like this.

17:35.161 --> 17:38.128
I don't, either.

17:41.734 --> 17:43.133
Have a seat.

17:48.107 --> 17:49.773
I'm so glad I caught you
before you left.

17:49.775 --> 17:51.708
I can't have you go hungry.

17:51.710 --> 17:53.644
Well, you shouldn't
have bothered.

17:53.646 --> 17:56.713
Arthur Avenue spaghetti
and meatballs, your favorite.

17:56.715 --> 17:59.449
In that case,
I'm glad you bothered.

18:01.754 --> 18:03.954
Look, one of my ADAs
came to me.

18:03.956 --> 18:05.589
He was very upset.

18:05.591 --> 18:07.491
ADA Pinsky.

18:07.493 --> 18:09.293
You were very tough on him.

18:09.295 --> 18:12.029
He challenged
an evidentiary ruling,

18:12.031 --> 18:14.164
one that saved
the state's bacon.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.233
One he disagreed with.

18:16.235 --> 18:18.402
He thought the guy should walk.
And?

18:18.404 --> 18:20.571
And I read the transcript.

18:20.573 --> 18:22.239
I think he may have a point.

18:22.241 --> 18:25.709
Although I don't owe
you an explanation,

18:25.711 --> 18:27.477
the evidence in question,
while relevant,

18:27.479 --> 18:31.281
is potentially prejudicial
and misleading.

18:31.283 --> 18:33.183
But it also proves
he may be innocent.

18:33.185 --> 18:35.452
This defendant is a
repeat drug offender

18:35.454 --> 18:37.087
with six prior convictions.

18:37.089 --> 18:39.456
But that doesn't prove
that he's guilty in this case.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.159
Our friendship does
not give you the right

18:42.161 --> 18:44.061
to question my judgment.

18:45.998 --> 18:48.265
I came to you because
I think your judgment

18:48.267 --> 18:50.434
is being affected
by Ellen's death.

18:50.436 --> 18:52.536
You're way out of line.

18:52.538 --> 18:54.771
I urge you to revisit
your ruling in this matter.

18:54.773 --> 18:56.607
Really? Why?
Zach.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.508
And if I don't?

18:58.510 --> 19:01.311
I will be forced
to file a complaint

19:01.313 --> 19:04.147
with the Commission
on Judicial Conduct.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.186
That's your right.

19:09.188 --> 19:11.855
Just remember
what I taught you.

19:11.857 --> 19:14.491
Actions have consequences.

19:15.728 --> 19:18.228
I think I've lost my appetite.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.167
Danny.

19:24.169 --> 19:25.869
What going on?

19:25.871 --> 19:29.006
I went to pick up Matthew from
the playground after school.

19:29.008 --> 19:31.208
He wasn't there.
Did anyone see him?

19:31.210 --> 19:33.610
He was playing with his friends,
and then he was gone.

19:33.612 --> 19:34.978
She thinks Ronnie took him.

19:35.981 --> 19:37.381
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

19:37.383 --> 19:38.949
I should've,
I should've pressed charges

19:38.951 --> 19:40.250
or filed a restraining order.

19:40.252 --> 19:41.585
All right, calm down.

19:41.587 --> 19:42.519
Calm down?

19:42.521 --> 19:43.754
You were the one who said

19:43.756 --> 19:45.088
that I should trust Ronnie.

19:45.090 --> 19:47.457
And now Matthew is missing.

19:48.794 --> 19:51.128
Find my son.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.520
Sarge!

20:10.522 --> 20:13.290
Sarge, anything on the
whereabouts of Matthew D'Angelo?

20:13.292 --> 20:14.324
Not yet.

20:14.326 --> 20:15.826
You guys canvassing
the neighborhood?

20:15.828 --> 20:17.594
Uh, as soon as we get
the interviews.

20:17.596 --> 20:19.496
Look, not for nothing, Sarge,
but we're on the clock here.

20:19.498 --> 20:20.897
We're talking about a missing kid.
Yeah?

20:20.899 --> 20:22.766
Yeah.
You think I should be taking notes?

20:22.768 --> 20:24.534
No offense, okay?

20:24.536 --> 20:27.004
Just keep us posted
on the interviews, Sarge.

20:27.006 --> 20:28.939
Stepping out of line

20:28.941 --> 20:30.774
isn't gonna bring Matthew back
any faster.

20:30.776 --> 20:33.276
I didn't want anything to do
with this case to begin with.

20:33.278 --> 20:35.278
Oh, now it's my fault?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.413
I didn't say
it was your fault.

20:36.415 --> 20:37.848
No, actually,
you just kind of did.

20:37.850 --> 20:39.082
I didn't mean it.

20:39.084 --> 20:42.252
Okay, well, look, we tried
to help those people,

20:42.254 --> 20:44.121
and it went south,
but instead of pointing fingers,

20:44.123 --> 20:45.589
let's just focus
on finding the kid.

20:45.591 --> 20:46.590
Okay.

20:46.592 --> 20:48.492
Reagan.

20:48.494 --> 20:50.060
Yeah.

20:50.062 --> 20:51.461
Okay, we're on our way.

20:51.463 --> 20:53.497
Somebody just spotted
a little kid

20:53.499 --> 20:55.532
with Matthew's description
a few blocks from here.

20:55.534 --> 20:56.867
Come on.

20:57.669 --> 20:59.169
That him?

21:00.039 --> 21:01.271
That <i>is</i> him.

21:02.708 --> 21:04.541
♪ ♪

21:10.015 --> 21:11.015
Matthew...

21:12.918 --> 21:13.617
You okay?

21:13.619 --> 21:14.918
I'm fine.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.586
Where's your dad?

21:16.588 --> 21:17.754
I don't know.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.793
Hey, you.

21:22.795 --> 21:24.795
Hey. Get on your feet.

21:24.797 --> 21:25.762
Hey! What's going on?

21:25.764 --> 21:27.030
Who are you?
Bill Donnelly.

21:27.032 --> 21:28.065
I live in this building.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.100
You know that boy,
Matthew D'Angelo,

21:30.102 --> 21:31.301
has been reported missing?

21:31.303 --> 21:32.335
Missing?
Yeah.

21:32.337 --> 21:34.037
No, no. This my son Eddie.

21:34.039 --> 21:35.906
They're in the same class.

21:35.908 --> 21:38.442
This your dad?
Yeah.

21:38.444 --> 21:40.725
Matthew said his mom told him
it was okay if he came over.

21:42.114 --> 21:43.914
I guess I probably
should've checked with her.

21:45.651 --> 21:47.017
It's all right.
We'll take him home.

21:47.019 --> 21:48.552
Give him his ball.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.759
Hey, kiddo.

21:55.761 --> 21:57.327
You got a second?

21:57.329 --> 21:58.795
Sure, boss. What's up?

21:58.797 --> 22:01.298
Just got off the phone
with the DA,

22:01.300 --> 22:04.267
who just got off the phone with
a very irate friend of ours.

22:04.269 --> 22:05.969
Judge Wilson?

22:05.971 --> 22:08.472
He said that you questioned his
ruling in an ex parte meeting.

22:08.474 --> 22:10.207
I did.
He also said

22:10.209 --> 22:13.243
that you threatened to lodge
a complaint with the CJC.

22:13.245 --> 22:15.212
He didn't leave me much choice.

22:15.214 --> 22:16.613
He arbitrarily
excluded

22:16.615 --> 22:19.116
key evidence
in a felony drug case.

22:19.118 --> 22:21.151
He's also angry,

22:21.153 --> 22:24.187
and he's taking it out on
defendants in his courtroom.

22:24.189 --> 22:25.722
Help me here.

22:25.724 --> 22:27.157
We're prosecutors.

22:27.159 --> 22:29.726
That is our problem... why?

22:29.728 --> 22:31.595
We are also
officers of the court.

22:31.597 --> 22:35.499
We have an affirmative duty
to ensure that justice is done.

22:35.501 --> 22:36.933
We're talking about Zach Wilson.

22:36.935 --> 22:39.336
He and I cut our teeth
together in this office.

22:39.338 --> 22:41.571
He taught you
everything you know.

22:41.573 --> 22:42.539
I know.

22:42.541 --> 22:43.974
And he's in trouble.

22:43.976 --> 22:45.308
And if somebody
doesn't stop him,

22:45.310 --> 22:46.810
he's going to destroy
his reputation,

22:46.812 --> 22:48.078
maybe even his career.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.448
The DA does not want
a war with the judiciary.

22:51.450 --> 22:52.816
It's bad for business.

22:55.487 --> 22:56.887
So what am I supposed to do?

22:56.889 --> 22:58.955
Apologize to Judge Wilson.

23:00.025 --> 23:03.493
And don't file
that damn complaint.

23:06.098 --> 23:07.731
I can't do that, Dennis.

23:07.733 --> 23:10.867
It's not a request, Erin.

23:12.004 --> 23:14.204
The DA wants this
to go away. Now.

23:23.148 --> 23:24.414
Speaking of brave,

23:24.416 --> 23:26.283
I saw your article
in yesterday's <i>Times,</i> Dad.

23:26.285 --> 23:27.784
And it wasn't supposed
to be brave, Jamie,

23:27.786 --> 23:30.654
it was supposed to be
a concise, reasoned case

23:30.656 --> 23:32.222
for our Broken Windows policy.

23:32.224 --> 23:35.058
Well, someone forgot
to tell the writer.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.927
Mmm. You saw it.

23:36.929 --> 23:38.295
Me, too.

23:38.297 --> 23:41.031
Guy sure made you look like
you got it out for the Speaker.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.666
No, I was quoted out of context.

23:42.668 --> 23:44.601
Do you still have it?
I want to read it.

23:44.603 --> 23:46.803
Please, Nicky, I'm eating.

23:46.805 --> 23:47.971
Dad, you called
Speaker Thomas

23:47.973 --> 23:49.339
“dangerously ignorant.”

23:49.341 --> 23:51.208
In what context
is that not inflammatory?

23:51.210 --> 23:52.876
I thought you said
it was “brave.”

23:52.878 --> 23:53.910
I'd stick with brave.

23:53.912 --> 23:55.078
Me, too.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.780
And what I said

23:56.782 --> 23:59.950
was changing
effective police policy

23:59.952 --> 24:03.453
without regard to the fallout
is “dangerously ignorant.”

24:03.455 --> 24:05.789
You didn't think the Speaker
could read between the lines?

24:05.791 --> 24:08.091
I never attached a name to it.

24:08.093 --> 24:09.426
Well, I will.

24:09.428 --> 24:11.695
Regina Thomas
is a chronic loudmouth

24:11.697 --> 24:13.863
who thinks this city would be
better off without cops.

24:13.865 --> 24:15.765
I kinda like her.

24:16.568 --> 24:17.500
What?

24:17.502 --> 24:19.402
Well, not
everything she says,

24:19.404 --> 24:20.660
but, you know,
the spunk and the style.

24:20.684 --> 24:21.839
Come on.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.873
Well, come on down to the
hearing she's chairing tomorrow.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.076
I'm sure she'll play
all her greatest hits.

24:26.078 --> 24:27.911
You're going to make
an appearance?

24:27.913 --> 24:30.113
I have to. Now.

24:30.115 --> 24:32.282
I mean, that <i>Times</i> interview
came off as

24:32.284 --> 24:34.317
an attack on the whole council.

24:34.319 --> 24:35.986
Well, I'll be
the first to stand up.

24:35.988 --> 24:38.488
I can tell you from the front
lines, Broken Windows works.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.457
You dismantle it,
all hell breaks loose.

24:40.459 --> 24:42.225
All hell breaks loose <i>again.</i>

24:42.227 --> 24:44.361
- Again.
- People do have the right

24:44.363 --> 24:46.196
to question the police
and its tactics.

24:46.198 --> 24:47.597
Yeah, but when
politicians do it,

24:47.599 --> 24:49.065
you can bet
there's an angle.

24:49.067 --> 24:52.002
Why can't cops and politicians
just be on the same side?

24:52.004 --> 24:54.037
They can, in a perfect world,
but this ain't one.

24:54.039 --> 24:55.639
Politicians have
a job to do, Jack.

24:55.641 --> 24:58.241
But when it comes
to keeping people safe,

24:58.243 --> 25:00.043
there's no place for politics.

25:00.045 --> 25:00.877
But...

25:00.879 --> 25:02.345
Nope.
I just think that...

25:02.347 --> 25:03.146
No.

25:03.148 --> 25:05.248
What, I can't...
Nope.

25:08.153 --> 25:09.452
Not fair.

25:13.492 --> 25:15.191
Okay. Okay.

25:15.193 --> 25:16.426
Calm... calm down.

25:16.428 --> 25:18.094
It's gonna be okay.

25:18.096 --> 25:19.896
We're gonna find him.

25:19.898 --> 25:20.897
Right.

25:20.899 --> 25:22.465
All right, I'll call you back.

25:23.602 --> 25:24.901
That was Lori D'Angelo.

25:24.903 --> 25:26.269
Why am I not surprised?

25:26.271 --> 25:27.270
Danny...

25:27.272 --> 25:29.205
Well, did her son
go missing again?

25:29.207 --> 25:30.974
I mean, maybe she should
check his bedroom

25:30.976 --> 25:32.475
before she calls
the cops this time.

25:32.477 --> 25:34.878
No, it was not
Matthew this time.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.313
It's her fiancé, Paul.

25:36.315 --> 25:37.414
Oh...
They were supposed

25:37.416 --> 25:38.715
to go ring shopping today.
Hmm.

25:38.717 --> 25:40.050
He never showed up.

25:40.819 --> 25:41.785
He never even called.

25:41.787 --> 25:43.520
Wow.

25:43.522 --> 25:44.888
Maybe his cell phone died.

25:44.890 --> 25:46.289
Or maybe he came to his senses.

25:46.291 --> 25:47.557
Danny, that's not funny.

25:47.559 --> 25:48.958
Come on, the kids
are in the car.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.560
Lori says he calls
or he texts

25:50.562 --> 25:52.062
if he's gonna be
five minutes late.

25:52.064 --> 25:53.763
And you know what?
It's been ten hours.

25:53.765 --> 25:55.532
Well, did she call anyone?

25:55.534 --> 25:57.467
Did she call his friends?
Did she call his family?

25:57.469 --> 25:59.235
Yeah, and she even
checked the hospitals.

25:59.237 --> 26:00.470
No one has heard from him.

26:00.472 --> 26:02.872
So come on,
could you just...

26:02.874 --> 26:04.841
Please, Danny.

26:06.144 --> 26:07.310
I'll look into it.

26:07.312 --> 26:08.645
All right.

26:10.549 --> 26:12.949
Oh, you know me, John.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.253
Well, I appreciate it,
Councilman.

26:17.255 --> 26:18.588
See you tomorrow.

26:20.659 --> 26:22.892
How's the vote
counting looking?

26:22.894 --> 26:24.094
It'll be close.

26:24.096 --> 26:25.261
Thank you.

26:29.601 --> 26:31.167
And what's up with you?

26:32.270 --> 26:33.336
What do you mean?

26:33.338 --> 26:35.638
Oh, come on,
something's going on.

26:38.844 --> 26:43.079
There's a judge who's been
making questionable rulings.

26:43.081 --> 26:45.048
Highly questionable.

26:45.050 --> 26:46.182
Anybody approach him?

26:46.184 --> 26:47.717
I did.

26:47.719 --> 26:50.553
And...?

26:50.555 --> 26:51.654
And it didn't go very well.

26:51.656 --> 26:53.289
There are...

26:53.291 --> 26:55.725
extenuating circumstances.

26:55.727 --> 26:57.293
He recently suffered

26:57.295 --> 26:59.896
a personal tragedy.

27:00.732 --> 27:02.565
Judge Wilson.

27:02.567 --> 27:04.267
He hired me, Dad.

27:04.269 --> 27:07.137
Taught me how
to be a prosecutor.

27:07.973 --> 27:09.939
I know that.

27:09.941 --> 27:11.641
But it does sound like

27:11.643 --> 27:13.643
he's not doing his job.

27:13.645 --> 27:18.114
I've been ordered
not to pursue the matter.

27:18.116 --> 27:20.083
I see.

27:20.085 --> 27:21.117
If I do

27:21.119 --> 27:22.552
lodge a formal complaint

27:22.554 --> 27:24.654
in defiance of
the District Attorney,

27:24.656 --> 27:27.524
it could damage Wilson's career.

27:27.526 --> 27:29.225
And yours.

27:29.227 --> 27:32.095
I could destroy a good man.

27:32.097 --> 27:36.766
And... ruin everything
I've worked for.

27:36.768 --> 27:38.902
Yeah.

27:38.904 --> 27:41.671
You could win the battle,
but lose the war.

27:43.475 --> 27:45.041
What am I supposed to do?

27:47.412 --> 27:48.912
It's hard to do the right thing

27:48.914 --> 27:52.949
when you don't know
what the right thing to do is.

27:56.121 --> 27:58.588
But I think you know.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.993
When the time comes,

28:03.995 --> 28:06.930
you'll know what to do.

28:18.477 --> 28:20.043
You wanted to see me?

28:20.045 --> 28:21.811
Yeah.

28:23.281 --> 28:25.548
I was hoping you could
clear something up for me.

28:25.550 --> 28:27.217
Sure, what's that?

28:27.219 --> 28:31.254
See, I just got a call from the
Commission on Judicial Conduct,

28:31.256 --> 28:33.723
confirming our complaint
against Judge Wilson.

28:33.725 --> 28:35.325
Dennis...

28:35.327 --> 28:36.826
But I said that was impossible.

28:36.828 --> 28:39.229
because Deputy Bureau
Chief Reagan and I

28:39.231 --> 28:41.498
discussed this and agreed
the matter would be dropped.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.266
Well, I didn't actually
agree to that.

28:43.268 --> 28:44.934
It was a direct order!

28:44.936 --> 28:46.436
From the DA

28:46.438 --> 28:47.670
and from me.

28:47.672 --> 28:48.972
I couldn't.

28:48.974 --> 28:50.206
I have an obligation...

28:50.208 --> 28:52.041
You have an obligation
to follow the directives

28:52.043 --> 28:54.177
of the guy
whose name is on the door.

28:54.179 --> 28:55.778
That's the job.

28:55.780 --> 28:57.680
That's what the job
has always been.

28:57.682 --> 28:59.582
It's not that simple, Dennis.

28:59.584 --> 29:01.584
Look, Erin...

29:03.288 --> 29:05.655
I've always liked
and respected you,

29:05.657 --> 29:07.657
but you went rogue here
and we don't do that.

29:09.895 --> 29:12.061
You're suspended.

29:12.063 --> 29:14.230
Effective immediately.

29:16.735 --> 29:18.735
Going to Mark's after school.

29:18.737 --> 29:19.869
Have I met his parents?

29:19.871 --> 29:21.804
Mom, Dad already
said it's fine.

29:21.806 --> 29:24.207
I met Mark's dad, okay?

29:24.209 --> 29:25.675
He's not a serial killer.

29:25.677 --> 29:26.776
At least, he doesn't
look like one,

29:26.778 --> 29:28.011
but then again,
they never do.

29:28.013 --> 29:30.280
Have his mother call me!

29:30.282 --> 29:32.982
Any sign of Paul Rossi?

29:32.984 --> 29:34.150
Not yet.

29:34.152 --> 29:35.585
But I will go
by his office after work

29:35.587 --> 29:37.220
and speak with
his co-workers, okay?

29:37.222 --> 29:38.788
I got a bad feeling about this.

29:38.790 --> 29:40.390
What else is new?

29:40.392 --> 29:42.125
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

29:42.127 --> 29:43.326
No, seriously, what is
that supposed to mean?

29:43.328 --> 29:44.294
I said nothing!

29:44.296 --> 29:46.162
Dan, you got something
to say to me?

29:46.164 --> 29:48.097
Okay.

29:48.099 --> 29:49.766
Ever since you got shot,

29:49.768 --> 29:50.833
it's like you're walking around

29:50.835 --> 29:52.035
looking for
what else can go wrong.

29:52.037 --> 29:53.503
You're just trying
to figure out

29:53.505 --> 29:54.537
what can happen next.

29:54.539 --> 29:55.672
That is not true.

29:55.674 --> 29:56.739
It is true!

29:56.741 --> 29:58.608
You know, you used to call me
once a tour.

29:58.610 --> 29:59.943
Now it's four and five times.

29:59.945 --> 30:01.177
You got the kids
on a tight leash

30:01.179 --> 30:02.779
and you're dragging me

30:02.781 --> 30:04.581
into your friends'
imaginary disasters.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.317
Well, pardon me for caring
about the people in my life!

30:07.319 --> 30:10.186
Look, bad things happen, okay?
And I know.

30:10.188 --> 30:11.654
We have had our share.

30:11.656 --> 30:13.389
But you can't walk around
living in fear.

30:13.391 --> 30:14.891
You think that's what I'm doing?

30:14.893 --> 30:17.193
That's what I know you're doing!

30:18.863 --> 30:20.730
And it needs to stop.

30:20.732 --> 30:21.898
Or what?

30:23.101 --> 30:24.667
Or what?!

30:50.319 --> 30:51.919
The Committee on Public Safety

30:51.921 --> 30:54.721
appreciates you joining us
today, Commissioner.

30:54.723 --> 30:56.824
Glad to be here.

30:56.826 --> 30:59.326
And the full council
will be voting on a bill

30:59.328 --> 31:02.796
to decriminalize
several minor offenses,

31:02.798 --> 31:04.698
an action which you,

31:04.700 --> 31:09.203
Commissioner, have called
“dangerously ignorant.”

31:11.540 --> 31:14.007
Comments I made in
the press were misconstrued.

31:14.009 --> 31:17.177
While I strongly disagree
with the bill

31:17.179 --> 31:18.846
that is under consideration,

31:18.848 --> 31:21.748
it was not my intention
to disrespect this body,

31:21.750 --> 31:22.850
and I apologize.

31:22.852 --> 31:25.119
I thought you were just
disrespecting me.

31:26.222 --> 31:27.821
This committee
has raised questions

31:27.823 --> 31:30.757
about a policy that has kept
this city safe

31:30.759 --> 31:32.893
for more than two decades.

31:32.895 --> 31:34.461
What I'd like, Madam Speaker,

31:34.463 --> 31:38.765
is the opportunity
to answer those questions.

31:38.767 --> 31:40.534
Commissioner,
the people in my district

31:40.536 --> 31:42.736
view the NYPD
as an invading army.

31:42.738 --> 31:44.338
What do you have to say to them?

31:44.340 --> 31:46.006
Well, most complaints

31:46.008 --> 31:47.541
concerning low-level crime

31:47.543 --> 31:49.877
come from districts
like yours, Councilman.

31:49.879 --> 31:51.378
We are there
because your people

31:51.380 --> 31:53.147
ask us to be there.

31:53.149 --> 31:54.681
Isn't Broken Windows

31:54.683 --> 31:58.185
just another Stop and Frisk?

31:58.187 --> 32:00.454
When you start selectively
enforcing the law,

32:00.456 --> 32:03.390
the bad guys start
selectively obeying it.

32:03.392 --> 32:06.260
Now, that is very, very catchy.

32:06.262 --> 32:08.896
But what about
the ordinary citizens

32:08.898 --> 32:10.764
that go to make up our district?

32:10.766 --> 32:12.299
Madam Speaker,

32:12.301 --> 32:14.234
I came here

32:14.236 --> 32:17.104
to defend a policy
that I believe in,

32:17.106 --> 32:19.540
and you came here to challenge

32:19.542 --> 32:22.476
the very foundation
of that belief,

32:22.478 --> 32:24.344
so, if your bill passes,

32:24.346 --> 32:26.413
the press will say you won.

32:26.415 --> 32:28.682
If it fails, they'll say I did.

32:28.684 --> 32:30.717
But either way,

32:30.719 --> 32:33.053
they'd only be half right.

32:34.423 --> 32:35.856
The truth is,

32:35.858 --> 32:37.224
we'd both lose.

32:37.226 --> 32:38.725
How is that?

32:38.727 --> 32:42.629
Well, if you succeed
in undercutting Broken Windows,

32:42.631 --> 32:45.232
that's a nice headline for you,

32:45.234 --> 32:47.067
but when the crime rate soars--

32:47.069 --> 32:48.702
and it will--

32:48.704 --> 32:51.371
you'd get the blame.

32:51.373 --> 32:53.173
And if the policy
stays in place,

32:53.175 --> 32:56.543
despite the attacks on it
by this council,

32:56.545 --> 33:00.380
I will look like
a tone-deaf autocrat,

33:00.382 --> 33:03.116
and the gap
between my department

33:03.118 --> 33:05.452
and the public
will grow larger.

33:09.258 --> 33:10.891
What do you suggest?

33:10.893 --> 33:12.793
Once upon a time,

33:12.795 --> 33:14.461
there was a thing
called compromise.

33:14.463 --> 33:17.731
It's become kind of
a dirty word these days.

33:17.733 --> 33:20.701
But our country
was founded on it.

33:20.703 --> 33:23.237
And it served us all very well.

33:23.239 --> 33:26.073
For a very long time.

33:26.909 --> 33:30.110
Thank you for the civics lesson.

33:35.651 --> 33:37.651
Everything okay,
Detective?

33:37.653 --> 33:39.453
Actually, no.
Your wife's fiancé

33:39.455 --> 33:40.988
went missing.
You know anything

33:40.990 --> 33:42.022
about that, Ronnie?

33:42.024 --> 33:43.490
No. Sorry.

33:43.492 --> 33:44.658
Hey!

33:46.962 --> 33:48.195
Ronnie!

33:49.198 --> 33:50.964
Ronnie!

33:57.773 --> 33:59.339
Shut up!

33:59.341 --> 34:01.875
Shut up!

34:04.713 --> 34:06.213
Shut up!

34:09.752 --> 34:11.485
Drop the gun, Ronnie!

34:11.487 --> 34:13.219
He's trying to take my family!

34:15.524 --> 34:17.724
You don't want to do this.

34:17.726 --> 34:19.659
Help!
I have to!

34:19.661 --> 34:22.161
You said divorce was a sin,
you remember that?

34:22.164 --> 34:24.697
Well, murder's a bigger sin.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.233
Now drop the gun!

34:27.002 --> 34:28.935
I just want 'em back.

34:32.741 --> 34:33.674
Hey.

34:33.676 --> 34:35.042
You shoot him,

34:35.043 --> 34:37.010
and I'm gonna shoot you.

34:38.547 --> 34:40.013
I don't want to do that, Ronnie.

34:40.014 --> 34:41.782
'Cause if that happens,

34:41.784 --> 34:44.150
then Matthew's
not gonna have a father.

34:44.152 --> 34:45.552
Hey, look at me.

34:45.554 --> 34:46.987
Look at me!

34:50.626 --> 34:51.992
Your wife left you.

34:51.994 --> 34:53.893
I can see
what it's doing to you.

34:53.896 --> 34:55.696
It's tearing you up, Ronnie.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.966
Don't do the same thing
to your son.

35:09.778 --> 35:11.178
Put it down.

35:13.082 --> 35:15.048
There you go.

35:19.221 --> 35:21.621
Step back.

35:28.464 --> 35:30.163
Speaker Thomas.

35:30.165 --> 35:32.032
Give us the room, please.

35:33.135 --> 35:35.168
As if he doesn't
know it's me?

35:37.773 --> 35:41.675
My people just
informed me that, uh,

35:41.677 --> 35:42.943
I don't have the numbers,

35:42.945 --> 35:47.013
and my bill is going
to be voted down.

35:48.417 --> 35:51.685
Not if it doesn't come up
before the full council.

35:53.021 --> 35:55.255
You knew you had the numbers.

35:57.159 --> 35:58.959
You knew it this whole time.

35:58.961 --> 36:02.028
I also know that what I said
in there is true.

36:02.030 --> 36:03.764
You losing doesn't mean I win.

36:03.766 --> 36:05.599
Well...

36:05.601 --> 36:07.134
Just so we're clear,

36:07.136 --> 36:09.703
Broken Windows goes too far.

36:09.705 --> 36:12.339
I mean, you just keep

36:12.341 --> 36:13.640
putting people in the system,

36:13.642 --> 36:15.242
and every time you arrest
more people,

36:15.244 --> 36:16.843
you create new criminals.

36:16.845 --> 36:19.413
Well, we can talk about that.

36:19.415 --> 36:23.483
Wait, you're willing to discuss
a change in the policy?

36:23.485 --> 36:24.651
Yeah.

36:24.653 --> 36:26.386
Be happy to hear your ideas.

36:27.856 --> 36:29.956
Oh, your nose is growing.

36:29.958 --> 36:31.024
But you know what?

36:31.026 --> 36:32.993
I'm gonna take you up on it.

36:32.995 --> 36:34.227
I'm gonna come and see you.

36:34.229 --> 36:35.662
Good.

36:37.099 --> 36:38.765
Madam Speaker.

36:38.767 --> 36:40.767
Commissioner.

36:40.769 --> 36:42.502
If you don't mind,

36:42.504 --> 36:44.604
I'll just slip out the back.

36:44.606 --> 36:46.673
All right.

36:49.611 --> 36:51.077
To be continued?

36:51.914 --> 36:53.880
Exactly.

37:07.296 --> 37:09.729
Sorry to drop in unannounced.

37:09.731 --> 37:11.665
You're a judge.

37:11.667 --> 37:13.233
You can do whatever you want.

37:14.636 --> 37:17.604
I was sorry to hear
about your suspension.

37:17.606 --> 37:19.105
Me, too.

37:19.107 --> 37:20.774
I spoke

37:20.776 --> 37:22.876
with the Commission
on Judicial Conduct today.

37:22.878 --> 37:25.245
I thought the DA withdrew
my complaint.

37:25.247 --> 37:26.913
He did.

37:26.915 --> 37:28.315
I called them.

37:28.317 --> 37:30.617
I don't understand.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.120
You were right, Erin.

37:34.122 --> 37:36.923
I allowed my personal life
to cloud my judgment.

37:36.925 --> 37:38.091
I see that now.

37:38.093 --> 37:42.062
You suffered
a huge loss, Zach.

37:42.064 --> 37:44.798
Yes, but others shouldn't suffer
because of it.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.601
The commission is reviewing
all my recent rulings,

37:47.603 --> 37:49.936
and I reassigned my cases.

37:51.373 --> 37:53.974
I'm going to be taking an
indefinite leave of absence.

37:53.976 --> 37:56.309
I am so sorry.

37:56.311 --> 37:57.344
Don't be.

37:57.346 --> 37:59.779
You did the right thing.

37:59.781 --> 38:03.283
And you were willing to pay
the price for it.

38:04.486 --> 38:06.820
Just like you taught me.

38:10.025 --> 38:12.626
And so the teacher
becomes the student.

38:13.529 --> 38:16.663
I spoke to the DA,
explained the situation,

38:16.665 --> 38:20.033
he intends to lift
your suspension.

38:20.035 --> 38:22.969
Thank you.

38:25.908 --> 38:27.173
Any chance

38:27.175 --> 38:30.844
I could get some of that
spaghetti and meatballs to go?

38:32.814 --> 38:34.881
How about to stay?

38:55.437 --> 38:57.337
There's chicken on the stove.

38:57.339 --> 38:59.205
Thank you.

39:02.244 --> 39:03.743
Lori told me what happened.

39:03.745 --> 39:05.845
She's-she's really grateful.

39:05.847 --> 39:07.514
Well, she was right.

39:07.516 --> 39:09.950
Just lucky I got there in time.

39:09.952 --> 39:11.885
What's gonna happen to Ronnie?

39:11.887 --> 39:14.020
Well, Ronnie'll be charged
for the gun

39:14.022 --> 39:15.088
and if he's lucky,

39:15.090 --> 39:17.757
the kidnapping
will get knocked down

39:17.759 --> 39:20.193
to unlawful imprisonment.

39:26.134 --> 39:29.469
I said some stuff this morning
I shouldn't have said.

39:31.206 --> 39:32.973
I'm sorry.

39:32.975 --> 39:36.876
I didn't know
you were so mad at me.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.080
I'm mad at myself.

39:40.082 --> 39:42.015
For what?

39:45.754 --> 39:47.253
When you were in the hospital...

39:49.524 --> 39:51.858
...I didn't think
you were gonna make it. I...

39:55.664 --> 39:58.765
There's not a lot
that scares me, you know?

40:01.269 --> 40:03.570
The thought of losing you s...

40:03.572 --> 40:06.439
really scared the hell
out of me.

40:07.643 --> 40:10.777
I think it still does.

40:10.779 --> 40:14.381
And I'm seeing this guy,
Ronnie, and...

40:14.383 --> 40:17.917
all he's going through
being alone, and...

40:17.919 --> 40:20.754
his life's torn to shreds.

40:22.958 --> 40:26.493
I know it's not you
who's living in fear.

40:29.898 --> 40:31.364
I'm the one that's doing it.

40:36.238 --> 40:39.072
I don't know how to stop it.

40:46.181 --> 40:49.683
I still get afraid every time
you walk out that door.

40:51.987 --> 40:53.953
It ever get easier?

40:56.124 --> 40:58.124
You learn to live with it.

40:59.528 --> 41:02.529
And to be grateful...

41:02.531 --> 41:06.666
when the door opens
and we get to be together again.

41:19.581 --> 41:21.748
I'm not going anywhere.
