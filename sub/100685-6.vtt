WEBVTT

00:06.841 --> 00:09.927
I was having an affair.
Stan must have suspected.

00:09.969 --> 00:12.221
He put a hidden camera
in the living room.

00:12.263 --> 00:14.974
What do they have on you?

00:15.015 --> 00:18.185
A video the night he died,

00:18.227 --> 00:19.937
and a text I sent last night.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.856
How'd they get the text?

00:21.897 --> 00:23.691
A wire tap.
Is that legal?

00:23.733 --> 00:26.318
We'll find out.
Who'd you text?

00:29.780 --> 00:30.948
My lover.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.700
Did he text you back?

00:32.742 --> 00:34.285
Yes.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.370
We'll assume they
have that, too.

00:36.412 --> 00:38.414
Is he part of this?

00:39.874 --> 00:41.167
Yes.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.004
And the video--
you've seen it?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.964
Me walking through
my living room

00:47.006 --> 00:49.133
when I was supposedly
being held hostage.

00:49.175 --> 00:52.178
The demand photo was staged.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.222
I just wanted a way
out of my marriage, that's all.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.852
-Stan wasn't supposed to die.
-CHANDLER: You have

00:59.894 --> 01:02.438
nanny cam video of a woman
walking around her own home

01:02.480 --> 01:03.773
in a bathrobe.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.483
At the same time
she claims she was

01:05.524 --> 01:07.693
-bound and gagged.
-My client had nothing to do

01:07.735 --> 01:09.487
-with her husband's death.
-BILLETS: Very least,

01:09.528 --> 01:10.738
she's part of a criminal
conspiracy

01:10.780 --> 01:12.239
that culminated in his murder.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.659
She didn't need
to pull the trigger herself.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.203
We want to know who did.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.665
I'll call the D.A.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.250
I think we can make a deal.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.257
Thanks.

01:33.636 --> 01:36.430
-Can I help you?
-Agent Sylvia Reece, FBI.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.681
I'm looking for Detective Bosch.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.643
I'll tell him you're here.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.532
You don't need to babysit me.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.867
Oh, I'm not.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.994
You sure I can't
interest you in a, uh...

01:59.036 --> 02:01.664
-No, thanks.
-I don't blame you.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.333
As a cup of joe goes,
it's a tasteless but efficient

02:04.375 --> 02:07.086
caffeine delivery system.
Which is not nothing.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.046
BOSCH:
Reece.

02:09.088 --> 02:12.842
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Thanks, Mank.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.343
Anytime.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.387
What am I doing here?

02:16.428 --> 02:18.848
Sovereigns didn't kill Kent.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.891
-His wife and her lover did.
-You charging her?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.226
D.A.'s making the deal now.

02:22.268 --> 02:24.395
You still think it's Brenner?

02:24.436 --> 02:25.729
About to find out.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.106
I want to be there.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.025
Why I called.
Tell anyone you're here?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.527
Not yet. Why?

02:31.569 --> 02:34.196
Leaks. Don't want
to spook her sweetheart.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.406
We don't leak.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.575
Right. Sit tight.
Right back.

02:43.289 --> 02:44.331
Gentlemen.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.545
She claims she didn't know
anything about the murder

02:49.587 --> 02:52.006
-until after the fact.
-Of course she didn't.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.090
-She'll give up her partner?
-She will.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.508
Full cooperation
with your investigation.

02:54.550 --> 02:58.262
-And in return?
-Conspiracy to commit extortion.
Two years.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.306
Seriously, two years?

03:00.347 --> 03:01.724
She's got a lot to trade.
Her co-conspirator

03:01.765 --> 03:03.559
is a federal agent.

03:03.601 --> 03:04.935
So fucking what?
Somebody died.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.606
That's the deal, Detective.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.323
-When you're ready.
-CHANDLER: Be candid.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.408
Nothing you say can be
used against you

03:19.450 --> 03:22.328
as long as you adhere to the
parameters of the proffer.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.167
About a year ago,
I started having an affair

03:28.208 --> 03:29.460
with Clifford Maxwell.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.629
What the hell?

03:31.670 --> 03:35.174
-I don't believe it.
-12 days ago,

03:35.215 --> 03:38.594
he killed my husband,
Stanley Kent, in self-defense.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.181
How did the affair start?

03:44.058 --> 03:47.019
He came to the house
to brief Stanley

03:47.061 --> 03:49.021
on new security protocols.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.856
I had some follow-up questions.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.526
Coffee turned into dinner,
dinner into...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.820
Where would you meet?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.699
Hotels.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.117
When it was clear that
it was more than a fling,

04:02.159 --> 04:03.577
I rented an apartment downtown.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.746
When did you decide
to kill your husband?

04:05.788 --> 04:07.373
I didn't.
I never decided

04:07.414 --> 04:09.124
-anything of the sort.
-My client

04:09.166 --> 04:11.877
has been clear from the start
that is not what happened.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.754
Just trying to get
her story straight, Counselor.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.506
I wanted a divorce.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.427
Stan refused to waive
his rights to my patent.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.721
I offered him half a million
dollars to buy him out.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.265
-A lot of money.
-More than fair,

04:25.307 --> 04:26.642
considering it was my invention.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.143
But he refused.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.648
Cliff came up with a plan

04:32.690 --> 04:34.525
to force his hand.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.193
I went along with it.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.362
-BOSCH:
What was Cliff's plan?
-I needed Stan

04:38.404 --> 04:39.738
to steal the cesium.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.365
Why?

04:41.407 --> 04:42.574
The morals clause.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.535
It's a felony.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.287
Voids the prenup, right?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.581
He would lose rights
to my patent either way.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.292
Mine was the better deal.
I thought he'd take it.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.878
He stole the cesium
under duress to protect you.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.214
Any good lawyer
could make that case.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.133
Of course.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.677
But Cliff was prepared to upload
a social media package

05:01.719 --> 05:03.846
linking Stan to the sovereigns.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.514
My husband, the libertarian.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.183
Who would a jury believe:

05:08.225 --> 05:10.602
a sovereign sympathizer
who stole enough radioactive

05:10.644 --> 05:12.938
material to poison
the entire city,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.149
or the heroic FBI agent
who brought him down?

05:15.190 --> 05:17.818
It wasn't supposed to
come to that, was it?

05:17.860 --> 05:19.862
Stan was a smart man.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.280
He stood to lose everything.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.325
Sign the papers,
return the cesium,

05:25.367 --> 05:27.703
and nobody would be the wiser.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.038
What went wrong?

05:30.497 --> 05:32.833
Cliff went to the overlook
to meet Stan.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.168
Said Stan attacked him.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.170
Tried to be a hero.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.964
Cliff said he acted
in self-defense.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.592
BOSCH:
So then to plan B:
blame it on the sovereigns.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.927
Yes.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.806
Expect us to believe
any of this?

05:47.848 --> 05:50.142
Believe what you want.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.187
My client has just handed you
the man who killed her husband.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.982
I got to call Brenner.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.026
And I've got to call
Chief Irving.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.531
Good story.
Fits what we have.

06:04.573 --> 06:05.866
Bet Maxwell has
a different version.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.242
Can't wait to hear his side.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.744
She lied, her deal goes
out the window,

06:08.786 --> 06:10.454
-we take 'em both down.
-Amen to that, brother.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.290
He's my partner. I should
be there when you bring him in.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.958
He trusts me.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.960
I can help.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.837
Please.

SWAT is on standby.

We'll keep eyes on the apartment

MAXWELL:
Okay. See you later.

09:39.538 --> 09:43.000
-Think we're burned?
-I don't know.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.334
The jurisdiction is clear.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.211
It's no longer a
domestic terrorist threat,

09:46.253 --> 09:47.421
it's a homicide investigation.

Maxwell is my guy.
He falls under my purview.

-No sign of Maxwell
at the Palace Apartments.
-(monitor beeps)

10:04.521 --> 10:05.522
Just got a ping on his burner.

10:05.564 --> 10:09.067
He's on the 5 headed south.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.236
-Making for Mexico?
-His phone is, anyway.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.697
All right, let's get an airship
up. Get eyes on the car.

Let's go.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.794
I think he's still in town.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.713
I think the phone
is a diversion to buy time.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.673
She might've said something
on the call, tipped him off.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.717
Or he sniffed SIS,
staked out the apartment.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.927
Apartment's Broadway
and Olympic.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.347

in a foot pursuit
of a possible 187 suspect

13:53.583 --> 13:55.377
in the Ace Hotel Theater.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.196
♪ ♪

14:41.840 --> 14:43.717
We'll split up.
Watch the crossfire.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.331
♪ ♪

15:40.565 --> 15:42.859
♪ ♪

15:48.490 --> 15:49.574
Hey!

15:57.540 --> 15:59.542
(sirens wailing)

16:11.596 --> 16:14.349
Nowhere to go, Cliff.
Show me your hands.

16:16.017 --> 16:19.145
All right.
All right.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.182
She'll be cleared.

16:58.643 --> 16:59.811
It was a good shoot.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.771
But her career will stall out.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.773
She's poison.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.400
Killed her partner.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.404
Never live that down.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.135
Go home.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.179
I will.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.372
BOSCH:
So I spoke to Alex Sands.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.336
Was Daisy working the streets?

18:06.377 --> 18:08.254
I don't know.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.174
I worried she was.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.634
She ever tell you
she was baptized

18:12.675 --> 18:14.636
by a street preacher
in Hollywood?

18:14.677 --> 18:16.054
No.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.848
He had a picture of her
on his wall.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.226
Was it him?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.853
Task force lifted
a partial print off of Daisy.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.439
I ran the prints
against the preacher's,

18:26.481 --> 18:28.066
no match.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.321
-Okay.
-He got her to call home.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.032
Said she was asking somebody
to come pick her up.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.867
-I would've remembered that.
-Preacher said "he."

18:37.909 --> 18:40.411
"He was coming to pick her up."

18:40.453 --> 18:42.455
Could someone else
have answered your phone?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.708
Could've been Roy, I guess.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.670
Who's Roy?

18:50.046 --> 18:51.631
My off and on boyfriend
back then.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.716
You know how to find him?

18:53.758 --> 18:55.760
(sighs)

18:55.802 --> 18:58.429
-I'll track him down.
-You don't keep in touch?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.682
Roy and I were bad
for each other.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.350
Okay.
Call me

19:02.392 --> 19:05.854
as soon as you find him,
don't tell him what it's about.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.063
Let me talk to him.

19:07.105 --> 19:10.108
-Okay?
-Okay.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.486
IRVING:
We have

19:13.528 --> 19:16.072
Maxwell's burner.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.032
He may have used it
to coordinate the murder

19:18.074 --> 19:19.617
of Stanley Kent

19:19.659 --> 19:22.620
and possibly Ben Craver.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.748
You think Cliff
killed his CI, too?

19:25.790 --> 19:29.085
A strong possibility.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.587
Craver's intel
led us to the Strouts.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.423
And Craver's a loose end.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.466
Working theory.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.345
(sighs)
Shit.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.849
We'll need access
to Maxwell's domicile as well.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.693
We'll keep you in the loop.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.328
(door closes)

20:11.294 --> 20:13.296
(birds chirping)

20:40.073 --> 20:41.991
Couple things missing here.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.535
FBI property.
We didn't take anything relevant

20:44.577 --> 20:47.455
-to your investigation.
-How would you know?

21:08.893 --> 21:11.813
-Hey, Harry.
-BOSCH: Yeah.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.652
EDGAR:
Nothing on it.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.279
They took the memory card.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.700
Nothing relevant
to our investigation.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.743
(rock music playing faintly)

21:34.877 --> 21:36.879
(chuckles)
Lizzie Clayton.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.674
Sight for sore fucking eyes.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.092
Buy you a drink?

21:41.134 --> 21:43.094
Roy.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.221
Don't tell me.
You miss me.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.098
Did Daisy call you?

21:47.140 --> 21:49.892
-Ask you to pick her up
in Hollywood?
-What?

21:50.935 --> 21:53.813
That summer before she died.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.024
She wanted to come home, Roy.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.775
Maybe. I don't know.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.028
-Long time ago.
-What the fuck, Roy?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.779
It was ten fucking years ago.
I don't remember.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.906
She did, I would've told you.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.784
-Oh.
-Uh-huh. You don't remember,
that's on you.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.786
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.330
You were probably fucking high.

22:11.372 --> 22:12.457
Fuck you.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.666
(grunts)

22:22.341 --> 22:24.343
Jerry.
Check it.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.264
Computer crimes.
Finally.

22:28.306 --> 22:31.142
Download of Maxwell's
burner cell.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.687
Man was head over heels.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.900
Shit got him dead.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.694
Lucky break for her.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.571
He can't contradict
her bullshit story.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.534
What's this about?

22:52.330 --> 22:54.373
Sent a photo, too.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.377
BOSCH:
And there's Craver.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.089
Maxwell wanted someone to know

23:01.130 --> 23:02.673
Craver was talking to the feds.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.467
IRVING:
So Maxwell

23:04.509 --> 23:06.469
outed his own CI
and then killed him?

23:06.511 --> 23:08.679
Or had one of the Sovereigns
do it for him.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.140
Lab's testing Maxwell's DNA
against samples

23:11.182 --> 23:13.893
-recovered from Craver's shirt.
-And Mrs. Kent?

23:13.935 --> 23:15.895
Made bail.

23:15.937 --> 23:18.648
As of right now, she's got
the sweetheart plea deal.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.233
(grumbles softly)

23:20.274 --> 23:22.068
That sticks in my craw, too.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.737
-(phone rings)
-Go ahead and take it.
We're done here.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.700
This is Bosch.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.744
Yeah, I know her.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.677
Guy's not pressing charges.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.887
-Didn't want to talk to us.
-BOSCH: Where is he?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.889
Home, nursing his wounds.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.850
Girl's got a nasty right hook.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.434
I'll take her from here.
Appreciate it.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.813
-Any time.
-Hope not.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.273
I wasn't drinking.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.360
Told you to let me talk to him.

24:04.402 --> 24:07.238
I needed to ask him why
he didn't tell me Daisy called.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.698
And?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.994
He said I was high.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.120
Were you?

24:15.872 --> 24:18.291
I don't remember.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.961
Come on.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.090
Did you know that Daisy
was in foster care?

24:27.508 --> 24:28.885
Saw it in her file.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.428
Well, you don't know
what it's like.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.764
I fought like hell
to get her back.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.976
I went to meetings, got sober.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.312
Made it to every visitation,
every court appointment.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.318
I just wanted a chance
to make it up to her, you know?

24:45.359 --> 24:48.321
To be better.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.364
I know you did.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.542
Can you take me to a meeting?

25:02.585 --> 25:04.295
Of course.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.187
I'm not giving up on Daisy.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.191
I know.

25:25.233 --> 25:28.486
Need anything, call me.
Yeah?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.537
(phone rings)

25:41.207 --> 25:43.167
Reece?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.211
Sure.
See you there.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.151
Hey.
Thought you left.

26:09.193 --> 26:11.153
I did.
I went to visit Powers.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.531
-Hospital sent him home today.
-How is he?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.366
Oh, he's, uh, better.

26:15.408 --> 26:18.119
He's thinking about using
his pension to put in a pool.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.370
Good for him.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.330
So, what are you
still doing here?

26:21.372 --> 26:23.374
Paperwork on the Terrion murder.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.167
I don't like to rush through it.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.586
Wish everybody here
had your work ethic.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.880
Just doing my job.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.008
Look, i-is everything all right?

26:32.049 --> 26:33.843
Fine.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.345
(clears throat)
I should get back to it.

26:36.387 --> 26:39.724
Well, tell Rondell
to start pulling his weight.

26:39.765 --> 26:40.808
(quietly):
Isn't that your job?

26:40.850 --> 26:41.976
Excuse me?

26:42.018 --> 26:44.228
I will.

26:51.402 --> 26:54.655
REECE:
I just keep playing it
over and over again.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.657
You got to let it go.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.701
If I'd seen it sooner.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.619
If I'd put down my gun.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.372
Then it might have been you.

27:03.414 --> 27:06.208
Two years.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.545
She gets two years
and my partner's in the grave.

27:09.587 --> 27:10.755
It ain't right.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.423
No, it's fucking not.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.136
(sniffles)

27:18.179 --> 27:19.722
Cliff checked out a sound car.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.557
Few months back, his day off.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.477
Why would he need to record
audio on his day off?

27:24.518 --> 27:26.937
Maybe he wanted some insurance

27:26.979 --> 27:28.522
in case things went sideways

27:28.564 --> 27:31.067
and she tried to lay
all the blame on him.

27:31.108 --> 27:34.737
-Which she did, in spades.
-Yeah.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.531
That audio file's
got to be stored somewhere.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.992
I checked.
I couldn't find it.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.454
Maybe I'm wrong.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.207
Maybe it's nothing.
Just...

27:46.248 --> 27:48.250
Just a hunch.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.960
I'll keep an eye out.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.505
Didn't hear it from me.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.716
Of course.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.355
We even know for sure it's here?

28:09.397 --> 28:11.399
Nope.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.045
(clacking continues)

28:54.316 --> 28:56.485
Jerry.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.238
ChapStick.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.282
Hiding in plain sight.

29:13.627 --> 29:16.005
-Happy couple.
-Regular lovebirds.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.844
BOSCH:
Maxwell's meeting with Craver.

29:21.886 --> 29:25.014
Could have set up his camera
nearby, taken these himself.

29:27.308 --> 29:30.102
-Is that an audio file?
-Let's hear it.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.480
MAXWELL:
We can just force him to sign.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.357
-ALICIA: He'll never do it.
I know him.
-You said he was practical.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.984
ALICIA:
Pigheaded.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.111
MAXWELL:
It can't trace back to me.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.699
ALICIA:
You can use Stan's.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.911
It's gonna be fun
playing that for a jury.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.078
Ain't that the truth.

29:50.748 --> 29:51.916
(sighs)

29:53.959 --> 29:55.920
It's just fucking weird.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.547
She's my boss,
not my bestie girlfriend.

29:58.589 --> 29:59.965
You need to talk to her.

30:00.007 --> 30:03.177
And say what--
stop touching me?

30:03.219 --> 30:04.970
(laughs softly)

30:05.012 --> 30:06.430
Forget it.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.265
-I shouldn't have said anything.
-But you did.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.100
Puts me in an awkward position.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.311
I-I can't unhear what I heard.

30:12.353 --> 30:13.938
Now, according to regs,

30:13.979 --> 30:16.649
if I don't report what I know,
I'm complicit.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.317
Oh, come on.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.361
Don't be such a wuss.

30:21.779 --> 30:24.448
Let's just not
talk about it, okay?

30:25.866 --> 30:28.452
Thanks for the support.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.549
Won't take two of us
to book that.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.509
I'll do it.
You?

30:43.551 --> 30:44.969
Daisy Clayton case.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.137
How's it going?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.472
Going.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.767
-Later.
-Later.

30:56.438 --> 30:57.856
IRVING:
A new LAPD initiative

30:57.898 --> 30:59.900
to address the homeless crisis
in this city.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.027
Twin task forces--

31:02.069 --> 31:04.029
downtown and Hollywood.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.906
Homelessness is primarily

31:05.948 --> 31:07.908
a housing issue
and mental health.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.743
What can we do about that?

31:09.785 --> 31:11.620
BILLETS:
Well, uh, crime

31:11.662 --> 31:13.205
in and around
the camps is rampant.

31:13.247 --> 31:16.000
Drugs, assault, prostitution.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.460
Well aware of that, Lieutenant.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.547
We do the best we can with
the resources that we have.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.924
It's not enough.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.343
You just had
one homeless man bashing

31:26.385 --> 31:28.095
another's head in
over a patch of concrete.

31:28.137 --> 31:29.847
An unfortunate outlier, sir.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.223
Redeploy your personnel.

31:31.265 --> 31:32.516
Take from vice, narcotics.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.852
Yes, sir.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.145
We could move people
from CAPs

31:36.186 --> 31:38.355
and burglary, too--
I mean, a good

31:38.397 --> 31:40.024
chunk of those incidents
are homeless-related.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.650
Good idea.

31:41.692 --> 31:44.236
Captain, I want
Lieutenant Billets

31:44.278 --> 31:46.780
in charge
of the Hollywood task force.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.283
I was thinking
Lieutenant Thorne.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.120
Billets.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.623
Boots on the ground
by next deployment period.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.458
Yes, sir.

31:57.499 --> 31:58.876
This is a coordinated,
division-wide effort.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.544
Yes, sir.

32:00.586 --> 32:04.465
And whatever's going on
between you two of you...

32:05.883 --> 32:07.384
...ends here.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.470
(clears throat)

32:10.929 --> 32:12.640
Do you have a name
for this task force, sir?

32:12.681 --> 32:14.600
Operation Safe Sidewalks.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.769
Catchy, sir.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.021
I like it.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.738
(door closes)

32:27.780 --> 32:30.157
(knocking)

32:34.870 --> 32:37.039
Detective Bosch, LAPD.

32:37.081 --> 32:38.707
Roy Lewis?

32:38.749 --> 32:40.834
I told the cop at the bar
I'm not pressing charges.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.670
Not why I'm here.
Can I come in?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.965
-Hell of a shiner.
-Yeah.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.009
Forgot to duck.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.473
Honestly, my memory's spotty.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.266
But, yeah, she called.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.018
Why didn't you tell Elizabeth?

32:58.060 --> 32:59.687
Don't remember.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.147
Or maybe I did tell her
and she was too high to hear me.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.399
Preacher said
Daisy called you

33:03.440 --> 33:05.693
to get a ride home.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.736
Yeah, I went to pick her up,
and she didn't show.

33:07.778 --> 33:10.864
Figured she was off
with that boyfriend of hers.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.950
Alex Sands?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.118
(scoffs)

33:14.159 --> 33:15.577
Little weasel.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.830
Man, that kid was bad news.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.290
The two of them,
they were into some crazy shit.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.751
-Yeah, like what?
-(short chuckle)

33:22.793 --> 33:24.753
Like picking up men

33:24.795 --> 33:27.005
and shaking them
down for cash.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.591
Sands didn't mention that.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.844
Wouldn't have, would he?

33:36.014 --> 33:39.017
You were taking a cut,
weren't you?

33:39.059 --> 33:40.060
Why you didn't come forward.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.729
I was protection.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.188
In case they needed it.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.232
I-I never talked to the guys.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.234
I never knew any of the details,
I just took my share

33:47.276 --> 33:48.736
and I kept my mouth shut.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.821
Where were you the night
she went missing?

33:54.283 --> 33:56.577
Drunk off your fucking ass.

34:06.462 --> 34:07.629
Safe Sidewalks.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.006
It's good.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.924
When do you want to announce?

34:10.966 --> 34:12.509
When it's up and running.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.053
I want to announce results,
not promises.

34:15.095 --> 34:16.555
Got it.

34:16.597 --> 34:17.931
What else?

34:17.973 --> 34:20.642
Lot of people in this city
think it's time

34:20.684 --> 34:22.186
to see a Latina in office.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.563
We always knew Lopez
would take the east side.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.690
She's polling well city-wide.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.150
Good with the press,
with the voters.

34:28.192 --> 34:29.943
Warm, friendly.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.154
Likeable?

34:34.323 --> 34:36.950
I'm working on it.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.119
You need to get
your numbers up with women.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.747
Couple of high-profile
endorsements wouldn't hurt.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.457
Someone in mind?

34:43.499 --> 34:45.834
How do you feel
about Honey Chandler?

34:54.843 --> 34:56.386
BOSCH:
I talked to Roy Lewis.

34:56.428 --> 35:00.140
Daisy hated that guy.

35:00.182 --> 35:02.684
Said you and Daisy
were running a badger game.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.187
Baiting men, shaking them down.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.231
That true?

35:08.524 --> 35:10.317
Yeah, more or less.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.152
(short chuckle)

35:12.194 --> 35:14.822
There's got to be a statute
of limitations on this, right?

35:16.865 --> 35:18.450
Right.

35:18.492 --> 35:19.701
Yeah, okay.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.119
Tell me the scam.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.498
Uh...

35:24.540 --> 35:27.417
Daisy and I would put
an ad up on Backpage.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.253
Plenty of guys on the Internet
looking for something

35:29.294 --> 35:30.796
they can't just
get on any corner.

35:30.838 --> 35:33.257
-Underage girls.
-Mm-hmm.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.677
We'd use an anonymous e-mail,

35:36.718 --> 35:38.136
and plan to meet in this motel,

35:38.178 --> 35:40.764
Harvard House on Hollywood Blvd.

35:40.806 --> 35:41.890
How'd that play?

35:41.932 --> 35:44.518
They'd meet Daisy in the room.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.728
You know, she'd have a drink

35:46.770 --> 35:49.022
with them, play nice...

35:49.064 --> 35:51.984
while I hid in the closet
with a camera.

35:52.025 --> 35:54.111
She never had sex
with any of them.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.779
You'd run video from the closet?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.573
Soon as they took their
clothes off, I'd jump out.

35:57.614 --> 35:58.907
(scoffs)

35:58.949 --> 36:00.409
Photograph their ID

36:00.450 --> 36:02.870
so we had real names
and addresses.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.499
And then we'd take
whatever cash they had.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.918
And Daisy would go to the bank
and max out their ATM card.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.045
You have the videos?

36:16.091 --> 36:18.093
When she disappeared, I...

36:19.678 --> 36:21.305
...I deleted everything.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.098
Still got the laptop?

36:24.808 --> 36:27.311
Hard drive had
a lot of music on it.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.105
Which is why I kept it.

36:30.147 --> 36:33.817
That was important back then.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.402
Before Spotify, you know?

36:35.444 --> 36:37.321
Those were the days.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.914
Am I gonna get that back?

37:11.688 --> 37:13.649
How you doing, brother?

37:13.690 --> 37:14.816
Man, they put me
in a fucking cage.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.818
They threw me in the hole naked.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.529
-But they did not
break my spirit.
-Resolute.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.574
Hell yes.
We doing this?

37:22.616 --> 37:23.867
Hell yes.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.579
People need to know the truth.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.039
(chuckles)

37:29.081 --> 37:30.916
Well, let's get to it,
before they come for us again.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.293
Make sure you get the prison

37:33.335 --> 37:34.795
in the background, all right?

37:34.836 --> 37:36.838
Deep state, police state.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.965
Got it.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.132
You're up.

37:48.517 --> 37:51.353
I know that look.

37:51.395 --> 37:53.855
What look?

37:53.897 --> 37:55.732
Distracted, worried.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.110
"Thinking about a case" look.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.030
I may have a lead
on Daisy Clayton.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.907
That's good news.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.952
How's her mom doing?

38:06.994 --> 38:08.787
Coping.

38:08.829 --> 38:10.205
Lot of guilt.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.087
She reminds you of your mom,
doesn't she?

38:17.129 --> 38:18.296
Who, Elizabeth?

38:18.338 --> 38:19.339
Daisy.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.924
The two of them, together.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.971
I wanted to talk to you
about the Alicia Kent case.

38:26.013 --> 38:28.223
I'm not on it.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.600
Even if my last name wasn't
Bosch, it's high-profile.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.270
-No interns allowed.
-Good, I don't want you near it.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.022
(phone rings)

38:37.983 --> 38:39.192
Yeah?

38:39.234 --> 38:40.444
EDGAR:
Check your e-mail.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.237
Okay, thanks.

38:51.455 --> 38:53.165
WAYLON:
For ten days,

38:53.206 --> 38:56.501
I was unlawfully imprisoned
by the same people

38:56.543 --> 38:59.129
who murdered my brother Travis
in cold blood.

38:59.171 --> 39:02.758
The FBI and LAPD
framed us as terrorists

39:02.799 --> 39:04.384
because they see us a threat

39:04.426 --> 39:05.886
to their illegitimate
authority.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.055
They're the terrorists.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.640
My brother Travis was right.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.267
The United States of America

39:12.309 --> 39:14.019
has been overthrown

39:14.061 --> 39:16.730
by bankers and parasites.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.941
To the false armies
of the FBI, the LAPD

39:19.983 --> 39:22.277
and the Sheriff's department:

39:22.319 --> 39:24.321
we're watching you.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.203
View count's climbing.

39:34.581 --> 39:35.916
Are you worried?

39:37.667 --> 39:39.961
These guys are all talk.
