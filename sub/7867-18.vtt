01:20.645 --> 01:22.998
Hot dogs, not so hot dogs!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.814
Cold and droopy!

01:24.939 --> 01:27.989
Fried dough!
America's worst legal food!

01:28.114 --> 01:29.422
Never leaves your body!

01:29.590 --> 01:33.342
The Truth in Boardwalking Law
has really done a number on this place.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.833
Shoot an oversized basketball
into an undersized hoop!

01:36.958 --> 01:40.850
It's impossible!
The prizes have been here for 50 years!

01:46.105 --> 01:48.547
Maybe we should just check out
the street performers.

01:52.182 --> 01:53.176
Big deal!

01:53.301 --> 01:56.737
I could juggle six pins
if they let me use a unicycle.

01:56.862 --> 01:58.744
Well, if you think it's too easy,

01:58.869 --> 02:00.952
why don't you throw me
something else?

02:02.039 --> 02:03.100
Are you insane?

02:03.225 --> 02:05.989
You can't throw a little boy
into my cascade.

02:06.114 --> 02:08.119
Stop tossing kids!

02:18.195 --> 02:19.889
Man, I love Saturdays.

02:20.235 --> 02:22.361
Man, I love Saturdays.

02:22.486 --> 02:25.561
Finally, I can have fun
with something I bought for myself!

02:25.729 --> 02:27.980
A new water heater.

02:31.163 --> 02:32.265
Almost there.

02:35.094 --> 02:37.002
Five more water heaters,

02:37.127 --> 02:39.512
and we get a free water heater!

02:46.416 --> 02:48.667
A mysterious door.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.386
It's like a sauna in here.

02:59.821 --> 03:01.639
It is a sauna, in here.

03:02.322 --> 03:04.573
Must have been put in
by a previous owner.

03:04.698 --> 03:06.910
This house is full of surprises,

03:07.035 --> 03:08.707
but this is the first good one.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.374
I can't wait to tell everyone.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.357
This is great, honey.
Thanks for telling me about it.

03:18.482 --> 03:20.248
I hope you don't mind
I invited Lenny.

03:20.373 --> 03:23.148
And I hope you don't mind
I invited Carl and Moe.

03:23.273 --> 03:26.159
My invitation didn't say nothing
about no towels,

03:26.832 --> 03:30.179
so, I guess we should all
just go Scandinavian.

03:33.266 --> 03:36.215
Maybe I'll keep this to myself
for a while.

03:39.906 --> 03:40.928
Lamb kebab!

03:43.315 --> 03:44.306
Chicken kebab!

03:46.620 --> 03:47.560
Fire kebab!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.645
- Dad, no!
- Dad, yes!

03:51.811 --> 03:53.092
Water!

03:58.294 --> 03:59.203
Why...

03:59.500 --> 04:00.379
you...

04:00.504 --> 04:01.689
little...

04:02.642 --> 04:04.862
Burn, Barty, burn!

04:11.178 --> 04:13.932
His tongue will be in that cast
for a few weeks.

04:14.057 --> 04:16.505
It may put something of a cramp
in your lovemaking.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.175
No, it won't... if he wants me
to do something, he'll write it down.

04:25.086 --> 04:26.352
What does it say?

04:26.477 --> 04:28.017
Is it complimentary?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.269
Yeah, sure, it's complimentary.

04:30.437 --> 04:34.164
It is? Hey, everybody,
check out my compliment!

04:40.947 --> 04:42.871
How would you like me to remove it?

04:42.996 --> 04:44.688
Yanky or peely?

04:45.646 --> 04:46.459
Got it.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.122
I held up two for "peely"!

04:50.895 --> 04:53.019
I thought that was
a "Y," for "Yanky."

04:53.406 --> 04:56.045
I'll make a note in your chart
that you aren't always clear.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.962
At least I can eat again.

04:58.557 --> 04:59.480
Cherry.

05:02.197 --> 05:03.388
Too much cherry!

05:03.924 --> 05:06.246
Lemon.
That'll stop the cherry.

05:11.115 --> 05:13.063
Why is this happening to me?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.192
Well, I do have an idea,

05:15.317 --> 05:17.938
but just to be sure,
let's run some expensive tests.

05:21.606 --> 05:23.973
The fire burned off
your old taste buds,

05:24.098 --> 05:25.596
exposing new ones.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.872
That'll be our Christmas card,
this year.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.453
Homer, you've become a super-taster.

05:34.716 --> 05:36.961
The mildest spices will
overwhelm your tongue.

05:37.277 --> 05:40.240
Even a taco could drive you insane.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.389
I can't eat tacos?

05:43.672 --> 05:46.619
Oh, my God.
What day of Mayo is it?

05:46.744 --> 05:47.587
Cinco.

05:50.034 --> 05:52.952
Try these beets.
I boiled all the red out.

05:54.724 --> 05:57.000
I still taste overtones of pink!

05:57.298 --> 05:59.025
Dad, I got the perfect thing.

06:02.819 --> 06:04.028
It feels like food,

06:04.636 --> 06:07.449
but it has no flavor whatsoever!

06:07.617 --> 06:09.952
It's mac and cheese
from the school cafeteria.

06:10.517 --> 06:12.371
The blandest food known to man.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.874
- What else do they got?
- Tofu cubes, tidy Joes,

06:16.042 --> 06:17.764
chili con cottage cheese,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.378
pecan blandies,

06:19.546 --> 06:21.406
cream of steam, you guess 'ems...

06:21.531 --> 06:23.103
Who comes up with this stuff?

06:23.228 --> 06:25.718
Old comedy writers
who now have to work at our kitchen.

06:26.023 --> 06:28.241
The one rule we had
on Charles in charge,

06:28.366 --> 06:30.639
is Charles must always be in charge.

06:31.562 --> 06:33.851
- That makes sense to me.
- Good rule.

06:34.242 --> 06:35.329
Lunch card.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.205
Lunch card.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.498
- Lunch card.
- Don't have one.

06:39.623 --> 06:40.983
What are you doing here?

06:41.151 --> 06:44.198
Son, from now on, I'm eating
all my meals here at school...

06:44.323 --> 06:45.487
with you!

06:45.655 --> 06:46.962
What? No!

06:47.570 --> 06:49.811
Come on, relax.
I won't embarrass you.

06:49.936 --> 06:51.578
$3.85.

06:53.984 --> 06:55.131
Can I work it off?

06:55.256 --> 06:56.957
Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.585
I'll start you on Jell-O.

07:00.899 --> 07:03.839
I'm big and yellow
and I'm servin' Jell-O.

07:03.964 --> 07:06.258
If you're a fellow
and you want some Jell-O,

07:06.564 --> 07:10.345
you better bellow
"Hey, big guy, give me some Jell-O."

07:11.658 --> 07:15.209
No Jell-O for you, Bart.
It'll keep you up at night.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.437
Like last week when you crawled
into bed with me and Mommy.

07:21.104 --> 07:24.115
Sure is hot back here.
And there we go.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.695
Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.

07:31.654 --> 07:33.425
I used to date your daughter.

07:33.550 --> 07:36.413
Buddy, I'm here to eat,
not make interesting conversation.

07:37.318 --> 07:39.253
Dad, do you have to hang out
at my school?

07:39.378 --> 07:41.650
It's bad enough I have to be here
three days a week.

07:41.775 --> 07:44.353
Well, I know when I'm not wanted.

07:44.844 --> 07:45.827
Am I wanted?

07:48.551 --> 07:52.054
Hi, Homer Simpson.
Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks.

07:52.222 --> 07:56.156
We certainly are proud of Noah.
He's a straight-A student.

07:56.281 --> 07:59.380
Noah, state capitals:
alphabetical order, on my clap!

07:59.633 --> 08:02.730
Albany! Annapolis!
Atlanta! Augusta!

08:03.027 --> 08:04.566
Austin! Baton Rouge!

08:04.796 --> 08:06.735
Bismarck! Boise! Boston!

08:07.298 --> 08:08.946
Capital City! Carson City!

08:10.805 --> 08:12.825
He's terrified of you.

08:13.143 --> 08:15.744
That's why I'm here:
to make sure he gets good grades.

08:16.981 --> 08:20.165
You come to school
to help him get good grades?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.669
Isn't that why we pay school teachers
those enormous salaries?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.769
Well, call me over-involved,

08:25.894 --> 08:28.841
but someday,
your son will be my son's chauffeur.

08:29.184 --> 08:32.294
Well, I hope your son enjoys
being driven around

08:32.419 --> 08:35.013
by the president
of the United States.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.433
Really? What the future president's
doing right now.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.574
You don't see many
presidents doing that.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.780
Maybe L.B.J. at the end.

08:52.068 --> 08:54.439
It's not your son's fault,
it's yours.

08:54.564 --> 08:56.410
You have to hover over
your kid's shoulder

08:56.535 --> 08:57.817
to force him to succeed.

08:57.942 --> 08:59.496
It's "helicopter parenting."

08:59.664 --> 09:01.327
I don't have to "helicopter" Bart.

09:01.452 --> 09:03.876
I've got a backup plan
called "Lisa."

09:04.260 --> 09:05.853
Right, your second grader.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.607
Sure, she's smart,

09:07.732 --> 09:10.215
but how can she be successful
if she's not popular?

09:11.542 --> 09:13.194
Do you mind if I join you?

09:13.319 --> 09:15.012
That depends.
What are you eating?

09:15.180 --> 09:17.306
Baked potato, side salad and a...

09:17.475 --> 09:20.001
Well, we're having cold shoulder.

09:23.492 --> 09:24.813
Is this seat taken?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.648
No, go ahead, take it.

09:26.905 --> 09:28.317
Take it way over there.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.570
My God!

09:35.695 --> 09:39.403
My son's a loser
and my daughter's a loner!

09:39.528 --> 09:40.913
Way to go, Marge!

09:44.497 --> 09:45.881
Where have you been?

09:47.489 --> 09:51.274
No time. I'll deduce where you were
from a list of possibilities in my head.

09:53.966 --> 09:55.887
That makes sense.
Moving on.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.164
If we don't get more
involved in their lives,

09:58.289 --> 10:01.225
Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures.
Failures who work for...

10:01.627 --> 10:02.434
Noah!

10:02.857 --> 10:05.485
"Noah." I like that name.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.318
Don't you usually worries
about stuff?

10:12.443 --> 10:13.195
Do I?

10:14.031 --> 10:16.366
If Marge doesn't
worry about the kids,

10:16.491 --> 10:17.780
then that leaves...

10:18.227 --> 10:19.039
me!

10:19.245 --> 10:20.728
Help me, mayonnaise!

10:32.568 --> 10:34.518
Look at all
these helicopter parents.

10:34.643 --> 10:36.528
I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.

10:43.197 --> 10:44.768
There's no future in that!

10:44.936 --> 10:46.041
Don't forget,

10:46.166 --> 10:48.563
Monday is the balsa-wood
model-building competion.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.205
The American Balsa Council
will award this year's winner

10:51.330 --> 10:54.736
a $1,000 savings bond
for their college education.

10:56.066 --> 10:59.116
A thousand dollars?!
That's what my house is worth!

10:59.430 --> 11:01.118
Simpsons, what will you be making?

11:02.370 --> 11:03.367
I don't know.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.978
Time to take control
of my son's life.

11:08.103 --> 11:09.103
Let's see.

11:09.228 --> 11:11.359
What can he build?

11:13.309 --> 11:14.409
Too obvious.

11:16.918 --> 11:19.018
Got to be something from Earth.

11:20.021 --> 11:21.200
You're no help.

11:23.055 --> 11:23.974
Perfect!

11:29.895 --> 11:31.356
"The Washington Monument"?

11:32.429 --> 11:34.609
Washington Monument.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.375
I like Bart's idea.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.114
- You're not in this class.
- Willie swept me in here.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.656
My mistake.

11:43.808 --> 11:45.766
I did it! I helped my son!

11:45.891 --> 11:47.706
Helicopter Homer away!

11:50.211 --> 11:52.377
Black Hawk down!
Black Hawk down!

11:53.143 --> 11:54.168
I found this book

11:54.293 --> 11:56.857
in the "What's Wrong With My Daughter"
section of the bookstore.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.717
It tells you
how you can get popular.

11:59.132 --> 12:01.803
If I join a clique,
I'll be the kind of person I hate.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.349
Sweetie, our country was founded
by a clique:

12:04.474 --> 12:07.788
the Continental Congress.
Dolphins swim in cliques.

12:07.913 --> 12:09.585
Those are my two examples.

12:10.683 --> 12:11.813
They are good ones.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.924
And to show you how this book works,

12:14.049 --> 12:16.485
I will demonstrate on some rats.

12:20.798 --> 12:24.117
Let's try what chapter seven
calls "Un-sults,"

12:24.285 --> 12:26.885
insults disguised as compliments.

12:28.654 --> 12:31.750
It takes a lot of courage
to wear suspenders

12:31.875 --> 12:33.418
when you're not in the circus.

12:34.037 --> 12:35.800
That's very nice of you...

12:35.925 --> 12:38.109
You saying my clothes
are clown-like?

12:38.384 --> 12:39.778
I feel so insecure.

12:39.903 --> 12:41.319
Please be my friend.

12:41.444 --> 12:42.514
See, it works.

12:42.639 --> 12:45.931
And un-sults are just the beginning.
There's also envy-tations,

12:46.100 --> 12:48.850
hate-hugs,
spamming with faint praise and...

12:49.308 --> 12:51.930
Everyone,
want to go get frozen yogurt?

12:52.055 --> 12:52.807
I do!

12:54.209 --> 12:55.107
I'm sorry.

12:55.276 --> 12:57.317
I didn't mean "everyone" everyone.

12:57.442 --> 12:58.735
Hope you don't mind.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.302
That's all right.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.624
If I didn't sell booze,

13:07.749 --> 13:10.310
they probably wouldn't even
come here!

13:12.959 --> 13:16.336
And that, my dear girl,
is called the Toledo Take-back.

13:16.804 --> 13:18.713
I don't want
to hurt people's feelings.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.169
I see.

13:20.294 --> 13:22.644
Maybe you're not ready
for this book.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.371
It is more of a big girl thing.

13:25.496 --> 13:27.661
I'm a big girl!
I'm a big girl!

13:32.002 --> 13:34.501
One of you said something bad
about the other.

13:34.626 --> 13:36.231
- He did?
- He did?

13:42.100 --> 13:44.536
Son, you buy an awful lot
of airplane glue,

13:44.661 --> 13:45.991
but you never buy any models.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.118
Right, models.

13:48.732 --> 13:51.302
One Messerschmitt M.E. 262,

13:51.427 --> 13:53.070
a'67 S. G. T. O,

13:53.195 --> 13:55.750
an Alfred E. Neuman
with interchangeable arms...

14:02.354 --> 14:04.096
We'd like some balsa wood, please.

14:04.221 --> 14:06.506
Enough to build
a Washington Monument.

14:06.631 --> 14:09.264
- What scale are you using?
- What cologne are you wearing?

14:09.432 --> 14:12.019
None of your business!
Now we'd like our Washington Monument

14:12.144 --> 14:14.980
to be 1/500 the size
of the real one.

14:16.459 --> 14:17.661
Washington Monument?

14:17.786 --> 14:20.066
- Aren't you going to even try?
- What do you mean?

14:20.191 --> 14:22.414
- And who are you?
- I'm your son's principal.

14:22.539 --> 14:25.712
And the Washington Monument is the most
uninspired model choice there is.

14:25.837 --> 14:27.435
It's like saying, "I don't care.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.307
- "My kid's a loser."
- But...

14:30.286 --> 14:32.329
What's the hardest model there is?

14:33.060 --> 14:35.165
That would be Westminster Abbey.

14:35.525 --> 14:39.044
Attention parents, children
and childless weirdoes!

14:39.213 --> 14:41.379
My son and I are going to build...

14:41.548 --> 14:43.438
Westminster Abbey!

14:44.371 --> 14:47.272
- You've got to be crazy!
- Prepare to be frustrated!

14:47.397 --> 14:49.554
You won't get past
the north transept!

14:50.360 --> 14:53.677
How hard can it be? All we have to do
is follow the directions.

15:00.729 --> 15:04.319
Marge, the boy and I will be
making Westminster Abbey.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.726
Blabby's gonna build an Abbey.

15:06.851 --> 15:07.906
Groovy.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.696
But first, as part
of Operation Popularity,

15:10.821 --> 15:13.826
Lisa and I are hosting
a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party

15:13.951 --> 15:15.163
in the back yard.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.498
They're here!

15:16.667 --> 15:18.208
Where's my spray-on tan?

15:21.368 --> 15:22.420
"Ant poison"?

15:23.515 --> 15:26.401
Why do I always read
the labels after?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.094
Ladies, we've got it all.

15:29.457 --> 15:31.179
Rhinestones, stickers, tassels...

15:31.563 --> 15:33.846
Everything to make those
hundred-dollar phones

15:33.971 --> 15:35.821
look like five-dollar toys.

15:36.315 --> 15:39.101
- This party is twisted!
- You're fierce!

15:40.124 --> 15:42.228
I've never been called
"fierce" before.

15:42.353 --> 15:45.360
"Strident." "Hectoring"
has been tossed around.

15:45.627 --> 15:47.720
Let me take a picture of you
for my cell phone.

15:47.845 --> 15:49.213
I'll put you on my desktop!

15:49.338 --> 15:51.866
I'm going to make you
my friend on Facebook. Please confirm.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.008
Confirm.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.078
I am such a great parent
to both my kids.

16:01.608 --> 16:04.462
Hello, little girl.
Who do you belong to?

16:07.397 --> 16:09.747
Boy, why don't I do that for you?

16:09.872 --> 16:12.095
Isn't this supposed
to be my project?

16:12.264 --> 16:14.389
All the other parents are doing it
for their kids.

16:14.711 --> 16:17.255
Now stand back
and I'll take it from here.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.067
A little further back.

16:20.781 --> 16:23.565
- Do you want me to watch and learn?
- Naw, that kind of creeps me out.

16:26.544 --> 16:28.470
Must finish Poet's Corner

16:28.595 --> 16:32.326
or Bart will work for Noah
with his hot mom.

16:39.325 --> 16:42.272
That's not Henry the Seventh,
it's Henry the Sixth!

16:42.397 --> 16:44.252
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

16:45.254 --> 16:48.173
Don't give up till you finish
my dear Abbey.

16:48.727 --> 16:50.008
Geoffrey Chaucer?!

16:50.299 --> 16:52.594
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I'm buried here.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.591
And I want to tell you,
you're right to do all his for him.

16:55.716 --> 16:57.515
It's the best thing for the boy.

16:57.980 --> 16:59.601
That's terrible advice.

16:59.770 --> 17:00.852
Anne of Cleves!

17:01.159 --> 17:04.356
What you do for your son,
he'll never learn to do for himself.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.525
And where is this delightful boy?

17:07.694 --> 17:08.987
Oscar Wilde?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.046
There are only
two tragedies in life:

17:12.171 --> 17:13.957
one is not getting what one wants,

17:14.082 --> 17:15.873
and the other is getting it.

17:15.998 --> 17:17.618
But that makes no sense.

17:17.788 --> 17:21.748
"Experience is simply the name
we give to our mistakes."

17:21.873 --> 17:22.707
Shut up!

17:22.875 --> 17:25.292
These days,
man knows the price of everything

17:25.462 --> 17:27.271
and the value of nothing.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.517
Whatever happened to "boo?"

17:41.000 --> 17:43.895
Now we could smash
the real Westminster Abbey

17:44.020 --> 17:45.470
it looks like this.

17:47.541 --> 17:50.248
There are no flights
to London till 5:00.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.530
Welcome to Springfield
Elementary's Next Top Model...

17:54.944 --> 17:56.307
building contest.

17:57.765 --> 18:01.371
- He said your show.
- I watched it once!

18:01.540 --> 18:03.942
Now, judges, start your nodding.

18:08.827 --> 18:10.259
Flawless. Stunning.

18:10.384 --> 18:12.851
Awe-inspiring. Meticulous.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.338
These models are clearly the work
of meddling parents.

18:24.463 --> 18:27.965
The only entry that repels
my eye enough to be constructed

18:28.090 --> 18:30.150
by a student is this one.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.865
Congratulations, son.

18:31.990 --> 18:34.070
At least you followed the rules.

18:35.593 --> 18:37.073
In your face, losers!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.576
This helicopter is taking off!

18:41.621 --> 18:42.829
Stop the hovering!

18:48.085 --> 18:50.057
I didn't make this terrible model.

18:50.182 --> 18:51.129
My dad did.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.632
Why can't you guys let us
do things for ourselves?

18:54.906 --> 18:56.337
In the words of Oscar Wilde,

18:56.462 --> 18:59.522
"Experience is simply the name
we give to our mistakes."

18:59.647 --> 19:00.991
I saw him too, Dad.

19:01.116 --> 19:02.670
I'm sorry.

19:02.795 --> 19:04.162
I got carried away.

19:04.287 --> 19:06.822
From now on, the only thing
I'll ever do for you

19:06.947 --> 19:08.762
is cosign if you want a gun.

19:08.887 --> 19:10.962
At least I made Lisa popular.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.005
"I H-8 this?"

19:17.943 --> 19:19.103
I'm sorry, Dad.

19:19.228 --> 19:20.788
These girls are nice on the surface,

19:20.913 --> 19:23.119
but it's hard work
staying this shallow.

19:23.408 --> 19:24.788
I hope you understand.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.072
It's clear to me now.

19:27.197 --> 19:30.912
The best thing I can do
as a parent is simply check out.

19:31.376 --> 19:32.628
There's a middle ground.

19:33.483 --> 19:36.132
A light bulb is either on
or it's off.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.842
Not if you use a dimmer switch.

19:38.124 --> 19:41.379
That's what the dimmer switch companies
want you to think.

19:43.957 --> 19:45.107
What's wrong?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.527
I tried to fix the kids' lives,

19:48.652 --> 19:52.424
but instead I led them to rich
and rewarding personal decisions

19:52.549 --> 19:53.547
of their own.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.284
Well, I know a place in this house

19:57.409 --> 19:59.669
where you can really relax.

20:00.047 --> 20:02.439
The mattress the dog sleeps
on in the cellar?

20:02.564 --> 20:05.158
No, I gave that
to the homeless shelter.

20:05.631 --> 20:07.599
It was stuffed with cash!

20:08.045 --> 20:10.534
I'll make you forget all about it.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.755
Feeling better, Super Dad?

20:26.023 --> 20:28.616
I feel like I've died
and gone to Hell.
