about your marriage,

Emelia's plans about moving

19:22.335 --> 19:23.553

into the family business.

in violation

to take care of it personally.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.524
Ronen summoned her
to the mansion.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.047
And figuring that
she would cooperate

19:39.090 --> 19:42.224

against him, he killed her.
