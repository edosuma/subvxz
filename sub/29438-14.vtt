00:01.349 --> 00:02.959
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.614
Sometimes to do right,
you can't follow the rules.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.268
See all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.878
And check out
other Fox programs--

00:08.921 --> 00:11.446
Deputy, 9-1-1 and Prodigal
Son.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.970
Serial killers aren't just born.They're also made.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.885
Only on Fox.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.107
Previously onThe Resident... Today is the day we introduce

00:20.150 --> 00:22.892
3B Life to the American public.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.112
So you are Bell
and Cain's new partner?

00:25.155 --> 00:26.287
They're the new partners.
I'm the founder.

00:26.330 --> 00:29.290
-You should call me.
-Okay.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.856
I've just been hired
as the new team doctor

00:30.900 --> 00:31.901
for Georgia FC.

00:31.944 --> 00:35.122
This will remain
at St. John's unless

00:35.165 --> 00:37.341
there's another hospital
I decide to call home.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.908
What would be the terms?

00:38.951 --> 00:40.214
Chief resident.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.259
-Good to have you back.
-Cheers.

00:46.263 --> 00:49.571
I told you the table-side
Caesar was a bad idea.

00:54.358 --> 00:58.145
You know that little asterisk
they put on the menu?

00:58.188 --> 01:00.364
"This contains raw egg"?

01:00.408 --> 01:01.887
Why did I ignore it?

01:01.931 --> 01:05.326
'Cause you love to live life
on the edge. Like me.

01:05.369 --> 01:08.111
I really wanted to be with youyour first day back at Chastain.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.592
I know, but it's only one day.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.550
And we have so many more
to come.

01:12.594 --> 01:15.553
Unless you continue
to ignore the asterisk.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.383
All right.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.212
Kitchen's stocked.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.171
Bananas...

01:24.214 --> 01:26.129
-rice...
-Applesauce, toast.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.348
Yes, I'm well aware
of the BRAT diet.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.221
Have a good first day back.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.180
Be with you in spirit.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.182
-All right. I love you.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.923
Oh, nice. My little BRAT.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.403
Now go. I'm gonna be sick again.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.365
-Stay out of trouble.
-Call me if you need anything.

-Hey, Pravesh?
-Hmm?

02:07.475 --> 02:09.651
-Does that guy
look familiar to you?
-Oh, no. No, no, no.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.653
-Why?
-I don't know, I...

02:11.696 --> 02:13.220
I think he used to work here.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.178
You know, it's just
really hard to remember,

02:15.222 --> 02:16.962
you know, with all these faces

02:17.006 --> 02:18.181
just coming and going
around here.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.792
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You boys done?

02:20.836 --> 02:24.013
-Hmm?
-Oh, wait. I do
remember that voice.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.754
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

02:25.797 --> 02:29.453
The man who went up against RedRock and lived to tell the tale.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.802
Oh. Oh! Oh.

02:30.846 --> 02:33.022
You miss all this?

02:37.287 --> 02:38.462
You have no idea.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.464
How do you feel about getting

02:40.508 --> 02:42.423
your footsies wet in the ER?

02:42.466 --> 02:43.685
-We could use the help.
-Ah!

02:43.728 --> 02:45.295
-Wet footsies. I'm in.

02:47.036 --> 02:49.473
Psst.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.476
Good to see you, darling.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.391
CAIN:
Dr. Hawkins.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.264
Welcome back.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.265
Thank you.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.136
Nice to be back.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.314
Let's go.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.840
Brought Hawkins back?

03:08.884 --> 03:10.886
Uh, hey, let me call you back.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.457
He signed a lucrative deal witha national sports franchise.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.937
-He's still a whistleblower.
-I'm aware.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.330
Risk versus reward.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.679
I made the call.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.378
It's insanity.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.380
Turns out he's a rainmaker.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.251
And Red Rock likes the rain.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.384
Yeah, I'm well aware.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.081
Remember who you're talking to?

03:32.124 --> 03:34.692
Now, careful now... Barrett.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.305
Proceed with caution.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.307
I should have been informed.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.526
Leaving me out of the loop
on Hawkins is

03:42.570 --> 03:44.528
a sign of disrespect
to the surgeon who's made

03:44.572 --> 03:47.314
more rain for you and Red Rock
than anyone else.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.533
Not as much as you used to.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.622
Your billing is moving
in the wrong direction.

03:51.666 --> 03:54.843
Pair that with the expensive
neuro center we're building

03:54.886 --> 03:57.193
on your behalf,

03:57.237 --> 03:59.326
by my assessment I'd say...

03:59.369 --> 04:01.502
you got to hustle up.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.417
Hustle up?

04:03.460 --> 04:05.810
What exactly are you implying?

04:06.942 --> 04:09.466
Everyone has an expiration date.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.164
Everyone.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.180
I'm game.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.878
ANDREA:
I'm game, too.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.402
Even though most people don't
normally do it this way.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.404
That's true.
When most people start out,

04:34.448 --> 04:36.537
they only show each other
their bestqualities.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.887
And hide their worst, pretend
to be someone they're not.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.977
It could be months before youfind out who you're really with.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.761
Years.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.329
We will lay it all on the table

04:46.373 --> 04:48.200
next to these inedible eggs

04:48.244 --> 04:51.116
and DOA flapjacks.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.901
-A breakfast interrogation.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.207
Won't be my first time
on the witness stand.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.600
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.385
-Well, let's start there,
why don't we?
-Okay.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.821
Oh, hey, uh...

04:59.864 --> 05:01.692
Just checked on that

05:01.736 --> 05:03.564
outside hospital
hernia transfer.

05:03.607 --> 05:06.175
His incision was oozing.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.876
I interrupt something?

05:18.796 --> 05:20.450
Enjoy your meal.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.064
Uh...

05:26.108 --> 05:27.718
where were we?

05:27.762 --> 05:30.373
I was about to ask you
about your worst breakup.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.853
Yeah.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.507
No.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.291
No, we're-we're not going there.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.424
-What?! We're just...
-N-No.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.208
Sorry. Not-not a chance. The...

05:39.251 --> 05:40.731
-I-Is...? Whoa.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.429
Is that my pager? I think...

05:42.472 --> 05:45.388
Oh, look at that.
Saved by the pager.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.956
-Did you just page yourself?
-Excuse me?

05:47.999 --> 05:49.740
-What? Huh?
-What do you mean?
Who does that?

05:49.784 --> 05:51.742
- Okay.
-Listen, got to go.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.310
-Catch you later.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.399
Incoming Bay Six.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.620
-Hmm.
-All right, let's do this.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.584
Doug, I'm Dr. Hawkins.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.238
So what's going on?

06:09.281 --> 06:12.415
Uh... it was Taco Tuesday.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.548
I do it up real nice
for the kids.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.680
Queso, green chilis.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.335
I was cleaning the table off,
and I looked down,

06:19.379 --> 06:20.467
and that's when I saw it.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.903
BOTH:
Saw what?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.513
Drool.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.342
I was in the middle
of a photo shoot

06:26.386 --> 06:27.604
when it got real bad.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.345
Well, it's not uncommon

06:29.389 --> 06:31.695
for flashing lights
to trigger a headache.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.527
Your pupils are pinpoint.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.920
That means smaller than normal.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.444
I know what pinpoint means,
thank you.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.359
How long will it take me
to get normal?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.361
I'm tip-top
from top to tail, baby.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.319
-Then why are you here, Raj?

06:50.497 --> 06:52.368
Look, I get the runs,
like, every 20 minutes.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.370
All right,
I was on a date last night.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.851
Had to get off to the john
before the food even arrived.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.680
We were supposed to go see amovie after.  Forget it.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.030
We might as well watch it
on my phone in the bathroom.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.814
CONRAD:
All right.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.077
-All right.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.602
So you pull me into the ER
for what appears

07:08.645 --> 07:12.083
to be a drooler,
a headache, and diarrhea.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.694
So we threw you
some softball cases.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.130
We just don't want
to lose you again.

07:15.173 --> 07:18.742
Don't fly too close to the sun
on your first day back.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.571
-Mm-hmm.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.489
I could use a little sun.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.626
Mind if I join?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.628
Hawkins is back in action.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.194
What a lovely sight.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.718
They should be landing soon.

07:55.823 --> 07:59.174
54-year-old woman, Jet Ski
collision with a motorboat.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.219
Propeller lodged in pelvis.
Pulse: 126.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.569
Got it.
Voss, you're with me.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.179
Careful notto disrupt the propeller blade.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.963
Roger that.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.400
-What's her name?
-Becky Copple.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.402
Becky, we're gonna take care
of you, okay?

08:10.446 --> 08:11.621
What have we got?

08:11.665 --> 08:13.318
55-year-old male, same accident.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.972
Hit his head on the deck.
No LOC.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.758
GCS 14 on scene for confusion.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.673
I'm fine.
Just please save my wife.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.544
Becky,
do you know where you are?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.111
Hospital.

08:23.154 --> 08:27.202
BP's 75/40, pulse in the 140s,
02 sat 99%.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.378
She's cold and clamped down,
going into shock.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.686
No, she's inshock.
Hang two units of O neg now

08:32.729 --> 08:35.384
and activate
massive transfusion protocol.

08:35.427 --> 08:38.039
Dr. Feldman,
can you put in a central line?

08:41.303 --> 08:43.740
Oh, there's blood in her pelvis.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.263
KIT:
The propeller could be
tamponading

08:45.307 --> 08:46.569
a more catastrophic bleed.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.615
Becky, can you wiggle
your left toes?

08:50.747 --> 08:53.184
Great. How about your right?

08:54.185 --> 08:56.274
I... I...

08:56.318 --> 08:58.625
can't move my leg.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.409
What's going on?

09:03.107 --> 09:04.805
Ah, pupils are equal
and reactive.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.197
This shouldn't need stitches.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.503
How you feeling?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.810
Ah, just-just a headache.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.638
Maybe my eyes are
a little bit blurry.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.728
Okay, possible concussion.
We'll run some tests.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.252
-Hey, I got another patient.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.384
-I got to go. You good?
-Good.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.038
-Sure?
-Mm.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.387
-John?
-Mm.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.780
-Squeeze my fingers.
-Ah.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.695
Squeeze my fingers. Good. Good.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.305
So you live here in Atlanta?

09:27.349 --> 09:31.179
Yeah, we do, but we spend most
of our time on the road.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.444
-Oh, yeah, why's that?
-Uh, well,

09:35.487 --> 09:40.449
Becky and I started the Copple
Foundation about 15 years ago.

09:40.492 --> 09:43.321
All right, push on the gas.
Push on the gas. That's good.

09:43.365 --> 09:46.324
Yeah, we, uh, serve the causes

09:46.368 --> 09:48.326
that we're
most passionate about.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.502
Health care is one of them.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.853
And that is why
we know this man so well.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.551
-John.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.292
I'm so sorry
to hear about the accident.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.859
Thank you, Logan.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.339
I'm, uh...

10:01.383 --> 10:02.776
Becky's hurt really bad.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.778
I assure you
she-she's in the hands

10:04.821 --> 10:06.693
of our absolute best.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.130
As are you.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.872
Thank you.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.353
-I'll be right back.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.358
KIM:John and Becky Copple are among

10:20.402 --> 10:21.795
the biggest donors to Red Rock.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.145
Most notably,
our new neuro center.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.887
You gave me a reason
to bring you back.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.890
Let's make sure that I continueto feel good about my decision.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.413
Okay?

10:36.853 --> 10:38.594
BP's up to 100/60.Pulse has come down to the 90s.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.074
This is our window to move her.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.032
Hang another unit of blood

10:42.076 --> 10:43.904
and let's bring the cooler
with us to CT.

10:43.947 --> 10:44.731
And then to the OR
to remove the propeller.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.384
Come on, people, let's move.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.563
Wait, wait. Wh-Wh-Where-where
are they taking her?

10:51.607 --> 10:54.349
Imaging. Just part
of the process.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.836
It was my idea to go Jet Skiing.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.708
Becky loves the outdoors.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.884
I hate the sun.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.365
It's one of the few things
we don't have in common.

11:10.408 --> 11:14.195
But this boat
came out of nowhere.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.371
And we crashed at full speed.

11:16.414 --> 11:20.723
I just wish I had gotten
the worst of it and not her.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.116
I can't lose her.

11:22.159 --> 11:25.423
I just...

11:25.467 --> 11:28.818
I-I don't even know what my lifelooks like without Becky.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.039
I understand.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.607
But if we don't take care
of you, then you can't

11:35.651 --> 11:38.349
take care of Becky, so how aboutwe focus on you for a minute?

11:38.393 --> 11:40.308
Deal?

11:40.351 --> 11:42.179
-Deal.
-All right.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.182
I'm seeing
on your medical record

11:45.226 --> 11:47.881
you had a brain tumor
removed eight years ago?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.317
I did. Yes.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.406
It was a benign growth.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.364
-Hmm.
-Why?

11:53.408 --> 11:56.019
Just want to get a CTto make sure everything's okay.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.848
-Sound good?
-Let's do it.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.155
ANDREA:
So, thanks to ads,

12:01.198 --> 12:04.158
point of sale displays,
strategic partnerships...

12:04.201 --> 12:07.596
Oh, Randy, there you are.
Have a seat.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.990
The lovely Andrea just came
to the interesting part.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.864
You gentlemen remember
our first quarter projections.

12:14.908 --> 12:19.434
Well, this is
our actual revenue.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.479
50,000 units sold
in the first month.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.352
100 last week alone.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.267
-Those are real numbers?
-Mm-hmm.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.355
I mean, I knew we were
doing well, but...

12:27.398 --> 12:29.009
We can barely keep up
with demand.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.488
Well, then,
I say we increase production,

12:30.532 --> 12:32.186
with a larger facility.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.448
We could expand
to other regions.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.492
-Mm-hmm.
-BELL: You know,

12:34.536 --> 12:35.842
we should put some cash into R&D

12:35.885 --> 12:38.235
and lay the foundation
for a whole new line.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.846
You'll all be parking
your yachts

12:39.889 --> 12:41.282
next to mine
before the year's out.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.805
You know, maybe you can
quit teaching Pilates.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.067
Or, hell, she could buy
the studio.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.416
Hell, she could buy Pilates.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.809
I don't think that's possible.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.072
Uh, with the fortunes
we're gonna make, it is.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.682
-L-Listen, listen.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.033
I-I-I have been here before.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.731
All right? I mean, we are
playing with the big boys now.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.081
And with profits this promising,competitors will be

12:58.125 --> 13:00.257
trying to buy us
for a nickel and a rubdown.

13:00.301 --> 13:04.087
But I think we can all agree
that the real winning formula

13:04.131 --> 13:07.047
is not just what's in this
little bottle. No, no, no.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.962
No, it's-it's the people
in this room.

13:09.005 --> 13:12.226
All y'all, the-the men and
brilliant lady right here,

13:12.269 --> 13:14.750
united, working together.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.014
We have struck gold, my friends,and I don't know,

13:18.058 --> 13:20.103
but anybody here want
to let 'em take away our gold?

13:20.147 --> 13:22.671
-I'd like to see 'em try it.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.895
That is one enormous fracture.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.680
KIT:
The propeller sliced through
her sacroiliac joint.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.290
Explains why
she can't move her leg.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.118
Her pelvis has been completely
separated from her spine.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.685
AUSTIN:
And it's torn
through her internal

13:36.728 --> 13:38.121
iliac artery.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.862
The damage is so extensive

13:39.906 --> 13:42.082
-because this propeller
is cupped.
-KIT: So,

13:42.125 --> 13:44.040
the plan is,
we remove the propeller,

13:44.084 --> 13:46.129
stop the bleeding
before she exsanguinates.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.872
Then, if we succeed,
reattaching her pelvis

13:49.916 --> 13:52.570
to her spinewill not be a walk in the park.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.486
I'll prep the OR.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.055
CAIN:
What's the story?

13:59.099 --> 14:01.144
TBI.

14:01.188 --> 14:04.321
History of a benign brain tumorthat was successfully removed,

14:04.365 --> 14:07.324
but it's regrown.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.283
CAIN:
Well, hopefully
it's still benign.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.155
I'll send it to pathology
when I take it out.

14:12.199 --> 14:15.289
I'm gonna need to review his
prior scans and path reports.

14:15.332 --> 14:18.118
-Mm-hmm.
-There's also
an associated hemorrhage.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.382
-Is he symptomatic?
-Headache, blurry vision.

14:21.425 --> 14:25.038
And it's only gonna get worse
the longer we wait.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.996
We're gonna have to operate
soon. Any there any issues

14:27.040 --> 14:29.390
-that might complicate
his surgery?
-Eh, mild hyponatremia.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.045
That's likely related
to dehydration.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.308
Otherwise,
labs were unremarkable.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.180
All right.
I'll take him to my OR.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.970
Sir, you need to stay
in your bed.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.407
And keep your pants on.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.887
L-Look.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.152
IRVING:
Fasciculations?

14:53.457 --> 14:56.156
-When did it start?
-A few minutes ago.

14:56.199 --> 14:59.202
-Let's get another
full set of labs.
-Right.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.726
We'll check for
any electrolyte abnormalities.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.077
Should I, uh,
cancel Waffle Wednesday?

15:04.120 --> 15:06.209
Maybe just reschedule
till next week.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.645
HUNDLEY:
A little help over here!

15:07.689 --> 15:10.126
Respiratory distress, Bay Eight.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.214
-IRVING: Pravesh.
-Stay there.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.130
Get me an intubation kit.

15:14.174 --> 15:18.178
She started to wheeze and
couldn't clear her secretions.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.223
We tried BiPap
and she became altered

15:20.267 --> 15:22.225
and we couldn't
get her sats over 72%.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.111
Mild crackles bilaterally.
Increase the PEEP.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.028
PEEP is up to 15.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.855
Okay, that bought us some room.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.031
But she's still skimming
the treetops.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.250
All right, let's get a blood gasand a chest X-ray.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.253
And write her for broad-spectrumantibiotics with cultures first.

15:50.297 --> 15:53.082
Once we get the gas, we'll
put her on ARDSNet protocol.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.997
If her oxygenation
is still tenuous,

15:55.041 --> 15:56.999
we'll start inhaled epo.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.653
IRVING:Good plan. But this is strange.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.002
I mean, she came inwith a headache, for God's sake.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.004
And now she's very close
to max vent settings.

16:02.048 --> 16:05.007
We need to figure this out.
And fast.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.929
Can I talk to my wife?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.800
We need to get you both
in ORs ASAP.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.106
No, no, please. I just...

16:17.150 --> 16:18.151
-I need a sec.
-We have to be quick, though.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.283
Hold up, hold up.

16:22.285 --> 16:25.288
I know what you're gonna say.
We're in good hands.

16:25.332 --> 16:26.898
We're both gonna be fine.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.248
You love me.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.164
I was gonna lead
with "I love you."

16:31.207 --> 16:34.297
But, yes, all of that.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.299
Then I'll see you tonight.

16:36.343 --> 16:39.737
Make sure we're
in a recovery room together.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.832
In our 20 years of marriage,

16:47.876 --> 16:50.139
we've never spent a night apart.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.402
KIT:
We wouldn't want to break
a streak like that.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.317
AUSTIN:
Well, you've got two softies

16:54.361 --> 16:55.666
who'll do our best
to make it happen,

16:55.710 --> 16:57.407
but right now we got to go.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.756
JOHN:
I love you.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.324
-I love you.
-I love you.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.686
Hey.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.123
CONRAD:
How you feeling?

17:17.166 --> 17:20.735
Better. Thank you.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.737
It's so quiet. Where are you?

17:23.999 --> 17:25.957
Our supply closet.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.134
Oh, it's oursupply closet now?

17:28.177 --> 17:30.310
Well, we-we share it
with Jess and Irving,

17:30.353 --> 17:32.007
but it's mostly ours.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.012
You okay?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.015
Nic,

17:40.059 --> 17:43.018
I just...

17:43.062 --> 17:46.108
I just want
to say thank you for...

17:48.023 --> 17:49.981
...for being there

17:50.025 --> 17:53.333
and for, for never doubting
that I would be okay

17:53.376 --> 17:56.640
and for helping me.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.775
Helping me find
my way back here.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.169
You don't need to thank me.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.127
Yes.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.173
I do.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.177
Hey.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.179
You'd do the same for me.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.270
But you need to get back
to work.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.054
People are gonna think
you lost your mind,

18:19.098 --> 18:21.012
talking to yourself alone
in a supply closet

18:21.056 --> 18:22.362
on your first day back.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.801
That's fair. That's fair.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.412
I'll get home as soon as I can.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.414
I know you will.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.590
I'll see you tonight.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.814
Again?

18:39.857 --> 18:43.426
Unfortunately, Raj's bathroom
situation has escalated.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.167
But all of his stool studies
have come back negative.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.821
Mr. Corson's pants

18:46.864 --> 18:49.389
are back on, but he's
still having fasciculations,

18:49.432 --> 18:51.042
and he's started
to act confused.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.440
What?

18:57.484 --> 19:01.357
Pravesh. What's up?

19:06.319 --> 19:08.321
MUDDLES.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.671
I haven't heard that term
since I was in medical school.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.412
Meiosis, urination...

19:12.455 --> 19:14.240
Diarrhea, diaphoresis...

19:14.283 --> 19:16.459
Lacrimation, excitation
of the central nervous system,

19:16.503 --> 19:18.461
salivation.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.115
Yeah, so, if you add

19:20.159 --> 19:21.377
Doug, Cynthia
and Raj's symptoms together,

19:21.421 --> 19:23.858
it is textbook
organophosphate poisoning.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.903
How do three patients
who have nothing in common

19:25.947 --> 19:27.601
get exposed to a toxin
that's only found

19:27.644 --> 19:29.603
-in pesticides
and chemical weapons?
-I don't know.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.910
But they're all showing
different signs of exposure.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.566
If it is,
we need to treat them fast.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.047
Organophosphate poisoning
can progress rapidly.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.223
Hundley, push atropine
and one gram of 2-PAM

19:41.267 --> 19:43.312
-for all three of them.
-On it.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.318
KIT:
Dr. Okafor,

19:49.362 --> 19:50.276
why don't you give
that propeller blade

19:50.319 --> 19:52.147
a nice, big tug.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.803
MINA:
It's not budging.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.326
KIT:
It's stuck in the SI joint.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.198
You have to pull
with more force.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.419
Put your back into it, dear.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.858
Okay, it's not working.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.120
AUSTIN:
Step aside.

20:09.164 --> 20:12.254
I've got Excalibur.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.396
Damn.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.398
-It won't come out.
-MINA: Mm-hmm.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.095
KIT:
Allow me.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.404
Ortho isn't just
about brute strength.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.667
Sometimes you have to think
outside of the box.

20:33.710 --> 20:34.711
Hammer, please?

20:36.452 --> 20:38.193
And thenuse brute strength.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.543
Get ready.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.332
-MINA: Suction.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.333
-KIT: Retractors.
-AUSTIN: Sutures.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.513
What are the odds

20:53.556 --> 20:55.863
a benign brain tumor regrows?

20:55.906 --> 20:58.300
Well, it's rare,
but it can happen.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.476
Don't worry.
I'm here to deal with that.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.304
We're gonna proceed
with the craniotomy

21:02.348 --> 21:04.132
-to remove the tumor.
-Copy that.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.177
CAIN:
I'll get scrubbed up.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.920
Thank you, Dr. Cain.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.270
CAIN:
You're welcome.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.975
John, I'm gonna administer
the propofol now.

21:21.018 --> 21:24.413
Start counting backwards
for me from ten.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.382
-Just breathe.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.428
What'd you give him?

21:39.472 --> 21:41.343
Just relax.
Just breathe.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.214
What did you give him?

21:43.258 --> 21:44.346
I haven't given him
anything yet.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.391
CAIN:
You must have done something.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.696
He's tach'ing away in the 150s.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.394
His BP shot up to 180s.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.352
- It hurts!
-CAIN: What?

21:50.396 --> 21:52.398
-Where do you-- Where does
it hurt? Tell me what hurts.
-It hurts!

21:52.441 --> 21:54.443
-What's-what's hurt? What hurts?-My stomach!

21:54.487 --> 21:56.489
-Your stomach?

21:56.532 --> 21:58.229
Abort the surgery!

22:04.410 --> 22:06.934
KIT:
Dr. Austin,
you're on the left pelvis.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.501
Dr. Okafor, you're on the right.

22:08.544 --> 22:12.592
Fasten this obtrusive instrumenton each side.

22:12.635 --> 22:16.247
Now for the most critical part
of the surgery.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.250
We must bring her pelvis
and spine back into alignment.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.644
-AUSTIN: We're gonna
reduce her SI joint?
-Correct.

22:21.688 --> 22:25.256
You will both push your side ofthe pelvis towards one another.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.084
How hard do we push?

22:27.128 --> 22:28.434
It must be equal pressure.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.261
And what if one pushes harder
than the other?

22:30.305 --> 22:33.090
Then her pelvis will be
misaligned from her spine.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.658
We could crush her sacral nervesand leave her paralyzed.

22:35.702 --> 22:39.445
You must be perfectly in sync.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.055
I know I can count on you both.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.230
AUSTIN:
We got this.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.536
MINA:
On three?

22:45.015 --> 22:48.584
One, two, three.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.021
KIT:
Slowly.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.635
A little more pressure
from you both.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.249
Feeling some resistance.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.381
AUSTIN:
I'll adjust.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.082
Stop.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.218
MINA:
How did we do?

23:14.262 --> 23:16.525
That's anatomic.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.311
I've never seen
a more perfect alignment.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.705
Game, set...

23:22.749 --> 23:24.141
Match.

23:27.667 --> 23:31.497
My patient is stagnating inthe ICU after an aborted surgery

23:31.540 --> 23:33.368
because something you missed.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.892
We don't know that yet.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.242
Then what do you know?

23:38.286 --> 23:41.028
-You're the internist
here, right?
-Mm-hmm.

23:41.071 --> 23:44.074
In the great ecosystem
of this hospital, a flea.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.469
You had one job:

23:47.513 --> 23:49.819
to make sure my patient
was tuned up for surgery.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.168
So let me give you some advice

23:51.212 --> 23:53.562
upon your fresh return
to this hospital.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.521
Go do your one job

23:55.564 --> 23:57.392
so my patient doesn't die.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.659
What the hell happened in there?

24:03.703 --> 24:05.313
I'm replaying it in my head.

24:05.356 --> 24:08.708
This, uh,acute abdominal pain with nausea

24:08.751 --> 24:11.145
and hemodynamic instability
in the OR

24:11.188 --> 24:13.408
but with absolutely no prodrome.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.410
Could he have thrown
a clot to his bowel?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.368
I thought about that,
but nothing on imaging.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.196
And his lactate is flat.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.110
So what's your plan?

24:20.154 --> 24:22.983
Uh, reexamine head to toe.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.767
Rerun labs.
Get to the bottom of this.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.554
: Listen,let me know how I can help you.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.643
They-they took your head.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.209
You figured out
how to grow another one.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.646
But don't think for a second
they're not looking

24:33.689 --> 24:35.169
for any reason
to bring the ax down again.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.170
Who's "they"?

24:36.213 --> 24:38.172
Kim did the firing,

24:38.215 --> 24:39.652
but he and Cain are a team.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.654
There's no way
Cain didn't have a hand in it.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.743
And Cain doesn't carethat you brought in Georgia FC.

24:43.786 --> 24:46.397
For him, getting rid of you
is personal.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.487
Be careful.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.712
Buy you coffee?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.671
No.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.673
Please?

25:00.716 --> 25:01.935
Thank you.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.153
Fine.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.591
Uh, one almond milk latte
and one...

25:05.634 --> 25:08.376
-Large coffee.
-Thanks.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.597
What do you want to know
about him?

25:12.598 --> 25:14.600
AJ seems amazing,

25:14.643 --> 25:16.689
but I have been conned before.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.692
So, woman-to-woman,
off the record,

25:19.735 --> 25:22.825
jump in or run like hell?

25:31.442 --> 25:33.836
-All three patients
have stabilized.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.142
Cynthia just got extubated.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.752
-So you were right.
-Yeah.

25:36.796 --> 25:40.408
But how do three people
with no connection

25:40.451 --> 25:43.585
end up with the same rare poisonin their system?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.456
First, we find out. Then we callCounty Public Health

25:45.500 --> 25:47.241
and stop whatever caused this.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.245
So, you live nearby in...?

25:51.288 --> 25:53.203
-Savannah.
-Chamblee.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.944
Sandy Springs.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.293
Any recent exposure
to chemicals?

25:56.337 --> 25:59.296
-No.
-No.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.777
I bought a can of body spray.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.737
Has anyone sprayed insecticides

26:04.780 --> 26:05.825
near your home or your garden?

26:05.868 --> 26:07.391
I don't have a garden.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.828
Not that I'm aware of.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.090
No.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.266
Any vitamins or supplements?

26:13.310 --> 26:14.834
Yeah.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.706
Yeah, I just picked up
a new one.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.881
Um...

26:18.925 --> 26:20.666
3, uh... 3B something.

26:20.709 --> 26:21.841
3B Life.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.190
That's it.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.844
Hey, fingers crossed, I look
just as good as that doctor

26:24.887 --> 26:26.236
on the label
when I'm his age, right?

26:30.327 --> 26:31.633
Three different patients...

26:31.677 --> 26:33.200
All with
organophosphate poisoning.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.288
All on 3B Life.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.899
Well, maybe they use
the same cleaning supplies

26:36.943 --> 26:37.639
or pesticides.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.772
We did
extensive patient histories.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.774
You can't possibly know
everything

26:41.817 --> 26:42.862
that they came
in contact with...

26:42.905 --> 26:44.777
Yes, but, right now,

26:44.820 --> 26:46.561
the only link that we do have
is your supplement.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.911
-How widely was it distributed?-Wide.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.305
Okay. We need to call Public
Health and warn them about it.

26:51.348 --> 26:52.523
That's ridiculously premature.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.265
You can't call the CDC
on three patients.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.572
Dr. Bell, I know that you have
a personal stake in this,

26:57.616 --> 26:59.574
-but we have to...
-Okay.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.795
Maybe, maybe they have
other things in common.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.319
And if we act too quickly,
we'll destroy the reputation

27:05.362 --> 27:08.061
of a good product
that is helping people,

27:08.104 --> 27:09.062
not to mention me.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.585
Yeah, but if we wait,
people could die.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.108
So, beyond
an acute cholinergic crisis,

27:12.152 --> 27:14.110
people could have serious
long-term disabilities...

27:14.154 --> 27:16.722
I don't need to be educated onthe effects of organophosphates.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.899
Okay, Dr. Bell, we just need
to do the right thing.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.955
I can only see you
when I turn to look at you.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.044
When you stand to the right
of me, I can't see you at all.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.785
Must be because of the tumor.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.744
The bleeding is causing
some swelling,

27:38.787 --> 27:41.050
and that is what's affecting
your vision.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.530
Well, will it get better?

27:42.573 --> 27:43.749
I-I can't go blind.

27:43.792 --> 27:44.706
We're giving you some steroids.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.273
We're gonna decrease
the swelling.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.841
Now, if we can get
that tumor out soon,

27:48.884 --> 27:50.146
-then you should regain
your vision.
-"If"?

27:50.190 --> 27:52.148
-Let's get it out now.
-Yes, I know.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.716
I am of the same mind.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.152
But your labile blood pressure
and heart rate

27:56.196 --> 27:57.893
haven't been responding
to the treatments.

27:57.937 --> 28:01.201
-And I can't risk
sending you back into surgery

28:01.244 --> 28:04.508
unless Dr. Hawkins
can come up with a plan

28:04.552 --> 28:07.903
to make sure
that you're safe in the OR.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.731
-JOHN: What's the plan?
-Yes, Dr. Hawkins.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.255
What is the plan?

28:16.390 --> 28:19.785
John, I know you've been scannedand examined up and down,

28:19.828 --> 28:24.006
but do you mind
if I take one more look?

28:37.803 --> 28:40.980
Did that start to hurt
after the accident?

28:41.023 --> 28:43.025
No, actually.

28:43.069 --> 28:46.681
That painhas been on and off for a while.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.031
Sometimes it hurts so bad,
I feel like

28:49.075 --> 28:49.989
it's gonna rip right through me.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.252
Like today in the OR.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.601
And then...

28:53.644 --> 28:55.864
all of a sudden, it gets better.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.867
Now...

28:58.911 --> 29:00.826
I'm gonna untie your gown

29:00.869 --> 29:04.612
so I can get a good listen...

29:04.655 --> 29:07.267
to your lungs.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.447
What?

29:13.490 --> 29:15.014
What's wrong?

29:15.057 --> 29:18.017
There are blisters
on your shoulder.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.279
I did not see that earlier.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.020
CAIN:
Why the hell
didn't you see that earlier?

29:21.063 --> 29:23.196
That's your job. Didn't you do
a full physical examination?

29:23.239 --> 29:25.676
They-they weren't there
this morning.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.070
I'm sure. I would know.
I've had them in the past.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.290
That's why I hate the sun.

29:30.333 --> 29:33.423
And when we were outside,I was covered from head to toe.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.513
Hyponatremia.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.167
Recurrent abdominal pain.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.516
Blistering skin lesions.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.301
Blistering.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.216
Blistering, blistering,
blistering skin lesions.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.226
I need a urine sample.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.098
Right now.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.278
ANDREA:
There's got to be a mistake.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.279
I don't know.

30:03.323 --> 30:04.672
It doesn't make sense.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.282
We ship out hundreds
of thousands of units

30:06.326 --> 30:07.414
and only three people get sick?

30:07.457 --> 30:09.285
Well, it's not just three.

30:09.329 --> 30:12.027
No, I just found out
that two more patients

30:12.071 --> 30:14.073
have been diagnosed
with organophosphate poisoning

30:14.116 --> 30:15.901
-over at Atlanta General.
-Oh, my God.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.076
They're stable.
They're getting treatment,

30:17.119 --> 30:18.860
just like the ones here
at Chastain.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.122
Are they on 3B?

30:20.166 --> 30:21.123
They're on supplements.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.038
But if I ask for specifics,

30:23.082 --> 30:26.868
the doctors there will makethe same connection that we did.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.087
Then we test the facility,

30:28.130 --> 30:29.915
-we prove it's not us.
- Agreed, but...

30:31.742 --> 30:35.094
Zip is gonna start talking
about an exit strategy.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.531
-Wait, what? It's too soon.
-No, Andrea,

30:37.574 --> 30:41.013
there's a chance,
no matter what the percentage,

30:41.056 --> 30:44.625
that 3B is the culprit and
that we're dead in the water.

30:46.061 --> 30:49.151
-I can't believe
this is happening.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.761
I-I...

30:50.805 --> 30:53.112
I have to call the partners.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.295
Your post-op CBC is stable.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.600
No more bleeding.

31:03.644 --> 31:04.775
Distal pulses are strong.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.082
Becky, can you wiggle your toes?

31:08.170 --> 31:09.084
Looks good.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.696
Recovering from major surgery
is challenging,

31:12.740 --> 31:14.524
so we will be monitoring you
closely.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.526
Thank you.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.485
And what about John?

31:18.528 --> 31:21.270
He didn't have surgery yet.

31:21.314 --> 31:22.358
Why?

31:22.402 --> 31:24.143
We don't know.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.362
But we do know
his doctors are working on it.

31:26.406 --> 31:27.929
What does that mean?

31:27.973 --> 31:30.149
Will he be okay?

31:31.193 --> 31:33.108
Can I be with him?

31:33.152 --> 31:34.327
First, you must get well.

31:34.370 --> 31:37.417
Then you can be strong for him.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.507
When he had brain surgery
eight years ago,

31:40.550 --> 31:43.510
I held his hand all night.

31:43.553 --> 31:47.514
Like I could keep him with me,
just by physically holding on.

31:47.557 --> 31:48.645
And it worked.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.778
Well, as soon as we can,

31:50.821 --> 31:52.823
we'll get you two
back together again.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.091
And now we have urine
in the sun.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.571
Dr. Hawkins, I'm starting
to lose my patience.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.138
Just wait.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.401
I am not gonna stand here

32:05.445 --> 32:07.838
and stare at another man's urinewith you while John's tumor

32:07.882 --> 32:09.579
continues to swell.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.930
We don't have time for this.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.718
It was time well spent.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.419
What-What's happening?

32:23.463 --> 32:26.031
John, this urine changed color.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.336
That explains what happened
in the OR

32:27.380 --> 32:30.252
and gives us a diagnosis:
porphyria.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.254
Porphyria's when you have anexcess of the chemical porphyrin

32:32.298 --> 32:34.039
and it builds up in your organs,

32:34.082 --> 32:36.824
and when that happens,
certain stressors, like...

32:36.867 --> 32:39.131
the intense lighting in the OR,triggers a crisis

32:39.174 --> 32:43.657
that causes things
like blisters, stomach pain,

32:43.700 --> 32:45.267
and even organ damage.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.139
You got all that from my pee?

32:47.182 --> 32:50.142
CONRAD :
Combined with your exam

32:50.185 --> 32:52.709
and history of previousstomach pain and skin blisters.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.233
But yes,

32:54.276 --> 32:57.410
when the porphyrins turned
your urine dark in the sun,

32:57.453 --> 32:59.412
my clinical suspicion
was confirmed.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.718
So I've had this my whole life?

33:01.762 --> 33:04.852
Incredibly rare, easily missed,

33:04.895 --> 33:07.246
but the good news is...

33:08.334 --> 33:10.510
...we can treat you.

33:13.165 --> 33:15.080
We'll be sending
confirmatory labs of course,

33:15.123 --> 33:18.300
but I am confident you
will be back in the OR soon.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.694
Which Dr. Cain and I
will be prepping for you.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.262
-CONRAD: I made a list

33:23.305 --> 33:25.090
of all the meds that can be
fatal to a porphyria patient.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.266
Avoid these at all costs.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.268
I haven't had a porphyria
patient since residency.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.879
Yep, this is a unique case.
That's exactly why

33:31.922 --> 33:33.402
I made a list for everyone.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.665
Propofol for anesthesia,
that's safe.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.537
Morphine's okay.Just let me know before you give

33:37.580 --> 33:39.104
-any antibiotics.
-CAIN: Dr. Hawkins is right.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.193
We all need to review
the drug list.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.934
CONRAD:
And the reason John crashed
in the OR before

33:43.978 --> 33:46.198
was because of these intenselights, so we got these filters.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.548
CAIN:
We'll still be able to see,
but they change the wavelength

33:48.591 --> 33:50.245
of the light
that hits John's body.

33:50.289 --> 33:52.073
CONRAD:
Avoiding a porphyric crisis.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.693
What the hell happened?

34:03.737 --> 34:05.086
KIT:
She came out fine
after the surgery,

34:05.130 --> 34:07.219
then she went into V tach
and lost her pressure.

34:07.262 --> 34:10.309
Hold compressions.
Checking a rhythm.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.572
Damn, she's still in V fib.
We need to shock again.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.139
Charging to 200.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.183
Clear.

34:15.227 --> 34:16.880
AUSTIN:
Restart compressions.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.360
I'll take over.

34:18.404 --> 34:19.361
KIT:
Code labs are back.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.581
Hemoglobin is stable.

34:21.624 --> 34:22.712
She's not losing blood.

34:22.756 --> 34:24.323
But her calcium is under five.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.498
That's not doing her heart
any favors.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.108
Okay, we need more calcium.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.979
One gram
of calcium chloride, now.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.938
We ordered it hours ago. There'sa calcium chloride shortage.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.766
Take it from the crash cart.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.246
She should have received
more calcium

34:34.289 --> 34:35.508
with her blood transfusions.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.379
This is what happens
when drug companies

34:37.423 --> 34:41.122
discontinue products thatsave lives but don't make money.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.168
Calcium chloride is in.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.256
AUSTIN:
Continue compressions.

34:44.299 --> 34:46.127
30 seconds
to the next pulse check.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.998
Hope this works.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.263
CAIN:
Bull's-eye.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.310
Time to remove the tumor.

34:55.354 --> 34:58.139
How are the lights?

34:58.183 --> 35:01.273
Sufficient. My patient's
hemodynamic instability

35:01.316 --> 35:03.188
is no longer distracting me.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.841
You might want
to follow that lead.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.156
Forceps.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.028
His wife Becky just coded.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.249
They're still working on her.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.733
Get this to path.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.648
It's been hours-- why is he

35:28.691 --> 35:30.389
just getting to the tumor now?

35:30.432 --> 35:32.304
It's a delicate surgery.

35:35.611 --> 35:39.659
Dr. Cain is in the middle
of a very complicated surgery,

35:39.702 --> 35:44.229
and with the added precautions
for the porphyria...

35:44.272 --> 35:46.448
John's a lucky guy.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.472
I can see you.

36:10.516 --> 36:13.083
All of you.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.476
Surgery went well.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.914
Your tumor's gone, and your
preliminary path looks benign.

36:17.958 --> 36:20.482
And we have a plan to manage
your porphyria moving forward.

36:20.526 --> 36:23.398
Today you received
Chastain's finest,

36:23.442 --> 36:25.357
as promised.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.662
JOHN:
But Becky...

36:26.706 --> 36:28.360
where is she?

36:28.403 --> 36:30.797
She sustained serious injuries
in the crash,

36:30.840 --> 36:32.277
but, like you said before,

36:32.320 --> 36:35.802
John, your wife...

36:35.845 --> 36:40.110
she is strong enough
for both of you.

36:40.154 --> 36:44.158
She survived
a very grueling surgery.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.378
But hey, don't worry,

36:46.421 --> 36:48.945
we will make sure you
do not spend tonight apart.

36:48.989 --> 36:51.383
Your streak will be intact.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.304
So now what?

36:59.347 --> 37:01.480
I don't want to give up.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.264
What if I'm wrong?

37:03.308 --> 37:05.701
What if my supplements
are hurting people?

37:07.312 --> 37:10.532
Look... you and I
don't know each other well,

37:10.576 --> 37:12.534
but you have shown me so far

37:12.578 --> 37:14.928
a woman who
doesn't half-ass anything.

37:16.538 --> 37:19.280
So I believe
that you know your stuff.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.455
And I believe

37:20.499 --> 37:23.458
that you will do
the right thing.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.202
ANDREA:
I know it's not the 3B.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.770
-I know it.
-Actually, you don't.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.206
I see a future

37:32.250 --> 37:34.382
-buried in lawsuits.
-Oh, please, do not use

37:34.426 --> 37:37.298
-the "L" word.
-Okay, once we test
the manufacturing facility...

37:37.342 --> 37:39.126
We'll already be
on 60 Minutesby then.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.955
I know you're both concerned
about your own liability.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.870
-If...
-We poisoned people?

37:43.913 --> 37:45.872
Yeah, I think we might be alittle bit concerned about that.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.222
Okay, but let's remember thatI'm the reason that we're here.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.746
My product,
my skill, my judgment,

37:50.790 --> 37:52.879
that's... that's
what got us this far.

37:52.922 --> 37:55.882
So I ask that you trust me
to see us through this.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.231
Please.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.321
How many units have we sold?

38:00.365 --> 38:02.192
Enough that a recall costs us
millions more.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.238
All to protect a brand
that we don't even know

38:04.282 --> 38:06.414
will be worth anything
when this whole thing is done.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.416
It's time to walk away
from the table.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.765
I agree, I agree.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.767
We got to protect ourselves,
cut our losses.

38:11.811 --> 38:13.465
I-I think we
should declare bankruptcy.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.901
CAIN:
Liquidate the assets,

38:14.944 --> 38:16.903
make sure there's nothing left
to sue for.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.166
Okay, everything I have isin this company-- don't do this.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.254
It's over.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.516
Okay?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.518
I'm sorry.

38:23.562 --> 38:26.347
Maybe next time, don't make yoursupplements out of fertilizer.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.396
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.181
You're just a fat cat
who came along for the ride.

38:34.224 --> 38:36.531
And I appreciate the cash,
but do not speak to me

38:36.575 --> 38:38.011
like that again.

38:39.534 --> 38:43.277
I am just fine to go it alone,
if that's what I'm up against.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.584
There's another way.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.418
I'll buy you out.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.420
-Both of you.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.160
Take on all the liability
myself.

38:57.204 --> 39:00.076
You sure you have the cash
for that suicide mission?

39:01.121 --> 39:02.557
I'll figure it out.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.347
50 cents on the dollar
for all your shares.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.394
Hell, I mean, if I can get
some of my money back

39:13.438 --> 39:15.091
and, uh, dodge this bullet,

39:15.135 --> 39:17.572
I don't care how you do it.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.576
I'm sold.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.407
Okay.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.453
But make it fast.

39:39.681 --> 39:42.554
Why... did you...

39:42.597 --> 39:45.252
-Why... why did...

39:46.471 --> 39:48.255
Well, because, at this point,

39:48.298 --> 39:51.084
they think it's a coin toss
that 3B's at fault.

39:51.127 --> 39:52.477
They're panicking.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.131
And I think the odds
are slightly better than that.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.829
You know, yeah, it's...

39:56.872 --> 39:58.874
kind of betting the farm, but...

40:00.746 --> 40:03.052
...it's a chance to get
full ownership back

40:03.096 --> 40:05.359
for the two people
I care most about.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.101
Wow.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.319
Thank you.

40:09.363 --> 40:10.712
No, don't thank me.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.148
Just...

40:13.498 --> 40:16.588
Just pray we're not wrong.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.242
Otherwise,

40:19.286 --> 40:21.244
I just made the biggest mistakeof my life.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.290
And we're both ruined.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.916
Where's your friend?

40:42.396 --> 40:44.398
She's going through
some things right now.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.532
Hmm. Are you looking
for her red flags?

40:47.575 --> 40:49.316
Well, it's early.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.665
You know?

40:50.709 --> 40:52.275
She's looking
for yourred flags.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.147
What'd you tell her?

40:54.190 --> 40:56.105
You mean what didn'tI tell her.

40:57.324 --> 41:00.370
You know, you are enjoying thisa little too much.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.459
Mm-hmm.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.333
I led with "compassionate."

41:06.376 --> 41:10.163
Closed with "brilliant."

41:11.817 --> 41:14.515

to hold on and not let go.
