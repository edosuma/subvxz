01:55.200 --> 01:59.120
<i>The Inquisition has finally delivered
Spain to the Templars.</i>

01:59.480 --> 02:03.800
<i>Sultan Muhammad and his people
still hold out in Granada.</i>

02:04.200 --> 02:06.770
<i>But if his son, the Prince is captured...</i>

02:07.280 --> 02:10.039
<i>...he will surrender the city and the Apple of Eden.</i>

02:11.120 --> 02:13.440
<i>Do you Aguilar De Nerha...</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:16.770
<i>...swear to honor our Order in the fight for freedom?</i>

02:17.800 --> 02:20.960
<i>To defend mankind against the Templars' tyranny</i>

02:21.360 --> 02:23.240
<i>...and preserve free will?</i>

02:23.680 --> 02:24.920
<i>I swear.</i>

02:25.400 --> 02:27.560
<i>If the Apple falls into their hands...</i>

02:28.000 --> 02:30.400
<i>...the Templars will destroy everything
that stands in their way.</i>

02:30.440 --> 02:33.520
<i>Protest, dissent, our right to think for ourselves...</i>

02:34.080 --> 02:36.800
<i>Swear to me that you will sacrifice your life...</i>

02:36.800 --> 02:39.690
<i>...and the lives of everyone here to keep it from them.</i>

02:40.320 --> 02:41.970
<i>Yes, mentor.</i>

02:50.760 --> 02:52.960
<i>Our own lives are nothing.</i>

02:53.240 --> 02:55.320
<i>The Apple is everything.</i>

02:56.000 --> 02:59.280
<i>The spirit of the eagle, will watch over the future.</i>

03:19.600 --> 03:23.400
<i>Where other men blindly follow the truth...</i>

03:23.720 --> 03:25.110
<i>...remember...</i>

03:25.120 --> 03:27.040
<i>...nothing is true.</i>

03:27.200 --> 03:32.200
<i>Where other men are limited by morality or law...</i>

03:32.440 --> 03:34.030
<i>...remember...</i>

03:34.040 --> 03:35.690
<i>...everything is permitted.</i>

03:39.280 --> 03:44.000
<i>We work in the dark to serve the light.</i>

03:45.480 --> 03:48.480

Dad?

Your blood is not your own, Cal.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.240
They found us.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.210
Live in the shadows.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.720
Go! Go, now!

09:34.320 --> 09:36.160
You here to save my soul?

09:38.480 --> 09:40.080
Something like that.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.970
I understand it's your birthday.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.400
Yeah.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.920
The party's just getting started.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.040
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.360
"Oh, Lord, wash away my sin..."

10:19.480 --> 10:21.130
"and I'll be clean..."

10:22.880 --> 10:24.370
"...once again."

10:30.880 --> 10:33.530
You're not much for the Bible, are you?

11:04.240 --> 11:06.720
Be it known that Callum Lynch...

11:06.880 --> 11:09.720
has been found guilty of capital murder...

11:09.880 --> 11:12.800
...and is sentenced to die on this day...

11:12.960 --> 11:15.640
...October 21st, 2016.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.840
Does the prisoner wish to make a final statement?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.320
Tell my father I'll see him in hell.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.640
My name is Dr. Sofia Rikkin.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.040
At 6:00 p.m. yesterday evening...

13:08.200 --> 13:11.800
...you were executed and pronounced dead.

13:12.720 --> 13:17.200
Insofar as anyone in the world knows or cares...

13:17.400 --> 13:19.680
...you no longer exist.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.280
It's better that you sit.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.560
My eyes.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.440
What you're feeling right now is normal,
if uncomfortable.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.370
Cal...

13:42.960 --> 13:44.880
I'm here to help you.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.280
And you're here to help me.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.090
Let him go.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.400
Don't touch him.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.320
Go ahead, do it.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.480
Jump.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.920
You're not a prisoner here, Cal.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.490
I'm here to protect you.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.840
If you listen to me,

15:51.920 --> 15:53.640
everything is going to make sense.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.680
But you need to trust me.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.840
Where am I?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.960
You're in a rehabilitation wing...

16:00.040 --> 16:02.520
...of the Abstergo Foundation in Madrid.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.480
A private organization...

16:04.560 --> 16:06.880
...dedicated to the perfection of humankind.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.960
With your help...

16:10.120 --> 16:13.200
...we can pioneer new ways to eradicate violence.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.720
I had this.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.450
Your father wants him in.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.880
He's my patient. This is my program.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.040
Prepare the Animus.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.720
- Are the blades prepared?
- Right here.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.280
And we've confirmed their provenance?

17:01.280 --> 17:03.640
They belonged to Aguilar, recovered at his burial site.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.119
What are these?

17:06.119 --> 17:07.720
Assume final preparations.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Our regression...

17:09.079 --> 17:12.560
<i>Andalucía,</i> - 1492.
Record everything.

17:18.359 --> 17:19.800
Arm's ready.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
What is this?

17:32.960 --> 17:35.480
I'm sorry, Cal. This is not the way I like to do things.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.880
Then don't do it.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.810
Insert epidural.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.000
What do you want from me?

17:52.160 --> 17:53.600
Your past.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.120
Listen to me carefully, Cal.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.160
You're about to enter the Animus.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.800
What you're about to see, hear and feel...

18:02.480 --> 18:05.600
...are the memories of someone
who's been dead for 500 years.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.960
Wait a minute!

18:08.640 --> 18:10.920
You can't change what happens, Cal.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.480
Engage scanner.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.360
Status?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.200
Scanning DNA chains.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.850
Searching for time frame.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.120
First memory match locked.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.040
DNA match identified.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.320
Stay with it, Cal.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.040
Attempt synchronization.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.200
We found him.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.760
We found Aguilar.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.840
Synchronization achieved.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.480
There.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.850
Commence regression.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.000
Our mission is the boy.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.120
<i>It's the Prince.</i>

21:39.080 --> 21:40.880
<i>Which household harbored the boy?</i>

21:46.760 --> 21:48.000
<i>I alone.</i>

21:58.240 --> 22:01.920
<i>Nobody else knew he was there.</i>

22:03.360 --> 22:05.010
<i>Hang his family and make him watch.</i>

22:08.400 --> 22:09.840
<i>Burn the whole village.</i>

22:30.600 --> 22:33.360
<i>With the Prince of Granada as captive...</i>

22:33.880 --> 22:37.960
<i>...his father the Sultan
will surrender his rebellious city...</i>

22:38.200 --> 22:41.520
<i>...the last safe haven for the infidels.</i>

22:41.680 --> 22:45.600
<i>God will punish his people's heresy.</i>

22:46.600 --> 22:51.730
<i>Finally Spain will be under one Templar rule.</i>

23:15.240 --> 23:16.320
<i>Stay with the memory, Cal.</i>

24:03.120 --> 24:06.880
<i>Aguilar!... The boy, Aguilar... The boy.</i>

26:23.880 --> 26:25.400
<i>Aguilar! The child!</i>

26:41.520 --> 26:42.930
Pull him!

27:02.680 --> 27:04.840
Commence rehabilitation.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.200
Run a systems check and log his condition.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.680
You did well, Cal.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.610
<i>Looking back, it's clear...</i>

27:31.640 --> 27:33.020
<i>...that the history of the world...</i>

27:33.080 --> 27:35.520
<i>...is a history of violence.</i>

27:36.520 --> 27:39.560
<i>Last year, the economic impact of antisocial behavior...</i>

27:40.240 --> 27:42.200
<i>...was $9 trillion.</i>

27:44.480 --> 27:48.530
<i>We believe that man today experiences...</i>

27:48.680 --> 27:49.920
<i>...a measure of aggression...</i>

27:50.080 --> 27:54.050
<i>...for which he finds no acceptable outlets.</i>

27:55.440 --> 27:56.850
<i>Now imagine...</i>

27:57.120 --> 28:00.400
<i>...if all these costs could be channeled elsewhere...</i>

28:00.480 --> 28:02.400
So the regression went well?

28:03.040 --> 28:05.120
Lynch is the one.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.760
A direct descendant of Aguilar.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.360
Everything was clear in there for the first time.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.210
<i>...what we all dream of...</i>

28:13.720 --> 28:15.440
<i>...a more peaceful world.</i>

28:15.600 --> 28:17.800
I see you stole my lines again.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.800
I only steal from the best.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.200
And the Artifact?

28:23.360 --> 28:24.440
The Apple.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.970
It's within our grasp.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.440
What happened in there?
Why did you pull him?

28:29.640 --> 28:30.640
I had to.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.120
We have to keep him healthy.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.440
Earn his confidence.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.280
And I know he'll lead us to it.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.480
Push him.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.800
That's not how the Animus works.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.160
Here you go.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.090
Thank you.

28:58.840 --> 29:02.160
1917, Rutherford splits the atom.

29:02.920 --> 29:06.480
1953, Watson and Crick find the double helix.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.080
2016...

29:10.120 --> 29:13.840
...my daughter finds the cure for violence.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.000
You've always been brighter than me.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.640
Now I'm late.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.200
I have to report to the Elders.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.160
Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition...

29:57.560 --> 29:59.920
...1492.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.880
War, religious persecution...

30:02.040 --> 30:03.880
...and the closest Father Torquemada,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
or any of our Order...

30:05.320 --> 30:06.810
...came to finding the Apple of Eden.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.040
How are you, my friend?

30:10.400 --> 30:11.480
Well...

30:12.840 --> 30:14.330
Your Excellency.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
Next week when the Elders meet...

30:16.560 --> 30:19.720
we shall vote to discontinue your Abstergo project.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.650
We feel that giving you three billion annually...

30:23.720 --> 30:25.520
...would be better spent elsewhere.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.570
Three billion is nothing compared to...

30:27.760 --> 30:29.250
We've won.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.920
People no longer care about their civil liberties.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.600
They care about their standard of life.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.960
The modern world has outgrown notions like freedom.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.400
They're content to follow.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.480
The threat remains...

30:43.560 --> 30:46.040
...while free will exists.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.440
For centuries, we've tried,

30:48.520 --> 30:49.670
with religion, with politics...

30:49.680 --> 30:51.090
...and now consumerism...

30:51.280 --> 30:53.240
to eliminate dissent.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.440
Isn't it time we gave science a try?

30:56.600 --> 30:59.120
My daughter is closer than we've ever been.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.440
How is your beautiful daughter?

31:03.360 --> 31:05.280
She has traced the protectors of the Apple.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.800
Where?

31:10.200 --> 31:13.400
<i>Andalusía,</i> - 1492.

31:13.960 --> 31:14.960
The descendants?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.120
All the bloodlines have died out.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.050
Bar one.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.640
We've traced his back 500 years...

31:22.800 --> 31:24.920
...to the Assassin's Brotherhood.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.360
The hallucinations are what we call the Bleeding Effect.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.010
Images of your regression...

32:45.160 --> 32:48.880
...layer themselves over
your present-day field of vision.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.890
If you allow me...

32:54.040 --> 32:55.680
...I can teach you how to control them.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.730
Stand down. I have this.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.720
Let her be.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.520
What is it? The machine?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.480
It's genetic memory.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.320
By using the Animus...

33:11.480 --> 33:15.160
...we can relive lives of those who made us who we are.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.240
What I saw in there...

33:30.360 --> 33:31.930
it felt real.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.440
It was.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.520
In a way.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.440
Don't mess with me.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.090
I feel different now.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.130
Why the aggression?

33:45.280 --> 33:47.080
I'm an aggressive person.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.960
What kind of prison is this?

33:51.520 --> 33:53.520
It's not a prison, Cal.

33:53.680 --> 33:56.440
You'll learn more if you cooperate.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.560
Let me go.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.730
I'm hungry.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.639
Come with me.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.840
What is this?

34:46.719 --> 34:48.280
I know everything about you, Cal.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.850
Your medical data, your psychological profile...

34:56.159 --> 34:58.680
...the mutations in your MAOA gene.

34:59.840 --> 35:03.000
I know about the foster homes, the juvenile halls.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.840
You're living proof of the link...

35:06.920 --> 35:08.120
...between heredity and crime.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.600
How did you find me?

35:10.160 --> 35:11.570
We found Aguilar.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.610
And when you were arrested, your DNA matched his.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.080
Who's Aguilar?

35:19.760 --> 35:20.840
Your ancestor.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.920
His family were Assassins.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.040
They were burned at the stake
by the Templars, Torquemada...

35:27.200 --> 35:29.280
and the black knight you saw, Ojeda.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.040
Aguilar took up the Assassins' cause.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.560
Do you get out much?

35:39.640 --> 35:40.880
More than you.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.480
And the others in here...

35:45.880 --> 35:46.880
...are they lab rats too?

35:47.360 --> 35:48.520
They're Assassins.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.880
Murderers, like their ancestors.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.480
Like you, Cal.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.360
All born with a predisposition to violence.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.240
Murderer?

36:06.600 --> 36:07.640
You killed a man.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.240
A pimp.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.920
Would you kill again?

36:20.280 --> 36:21.610
Happy families.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.930
She must be very proud.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.440
I wouldn't know.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.600
She was killed by an Assassin.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.450
Like your mother.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.040
Sorry.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.680
My old man killed my mother.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.880
And how does that make you feel?

36:50.120 --> 36:51.450
Like killing him.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.040
Either we let it affect us for the rest of our lives...

36:58.120 --> 37:00.440
or we do something about it.

37:00.720 --> 37:01.960
You turned to violence...

37:02.560 --> 37:04.240
I turned to science.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.840
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.640
I believe it exists.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.810
The Bible tells us it contained...

37:13.880 --> 37:16.040
...the seed of man's first disobedience.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.040
But there are those of us who believe...

37:22.000 --> 37:25.200
...that God, or some ancient civilization...

37:26.320 --> 37:28.520
...has left us a road map to understand...

37:28.640 --> 37:30.000
...why people are violent.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.040
Aguilar was the last person...

37:33.120 --> 37:35.600
...known to have had it in his possession.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.010
We need you to find out where he hid it.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.680
I thought I was here to be cured.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.010
Violence is a disease, like cancer.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.560
And, like cancer...

37:49.720 --> 37:51.480
...we hope to control it one day.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.600
Violence is what kept me alive.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.080
Well, technically, you're dead.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.320
I'm hungry.

38:06.440 --> 38:07.440
What's in it for me?

38:07.520 --> 38:08.890
Once my research is complete...

38:08.920 --> 38:11.000
...there is no reason to keep you here.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.410
I get my life back?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.120
Better.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.160
A new one.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.240
You're hungry.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.850
You don't know who he is, what he is.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.600
That's a dangerous man.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.330
Give him a little more time, Emir.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.050
The man might prove to have some noble blood in him yet.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.090
How about here, sir?

39:04.760 --> 39:07.730
It's an open menu, but we do recommend the chicken.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.330
What can I get you, Mr. Lynch?

39:17.400 --> 39:19.400
It's an open menu, but we do recommend the chicken.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.810
I'll have steak.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.290
Steak for the pioneer.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.520
Who are you?

39:36.480 --> 39:38.200
They call me Moussa.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.480
But my name is Baptiste.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.720
I'm dead 200 years now.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.010
Voodoo poisoner.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.810
I'm harmless.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.680
Ah. They're watching you.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.040
Waitin' to see who you are, pioneer.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.480
Have you met him yet?

40:10.080 --> 40:12.000
Have you met him yet?

40:14.720 --> 40:17.560
We are the last to protect the Apple, my friend.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.880
Make the wrong choice...

40:20.160 --> 40:22.810
you gonna send us all to infinity.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.160
This...

40:31.440 --> 40:32.480
...belongs to you.

40:37.680 --> 40:40.200
Progress requires sacrifice.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.680
You're gonna lead them right to it.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.890
No. I'm going to eat it.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.400
In quality, find peace.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.570
What the fuck is going on?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.840
He has to go back in the Animus.

41:40.840 --> 41:41.960
Now.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.360
He needs more time before he goes in again.

41:45.480 --> 41:48.130
We don't have time.

41:49.880 --> 41:50.920
Why?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.760
I won't risk his life.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.560
Then I'll have to find someone else to do it.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.280
You're up, slugger.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.610
I'm crazy.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.160
<i>♪ I'm crazy ♪</i>

43:25.240 --> 43:29.370
<i>♪ Crazy for feeling so lonely ♪</i>

43:38.760 --> 43:40.280
They're getting him back in again.

43:40.880 --> 43:43.720
Then we should stop him before he betrays us.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.280
Set the date for the 6th.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.370
<i>♪ Why do I let myself... ♪</i>

43:48.400 --> 43:49.970
If his condition deteriorates,

43:50.040 --> 43:51.180
...pull him out.
<i>♪ ...worry? ♪</i>

43:51.200 --> 43:52.200
Your father...

43:52.240 --> 43:53.620
...I don't care what my father said.

43:54.640 --> 43:59.480
<i>♪ What in the world did I do? ♪</i>

43:59.640 --> 44:01.240
Cal, listen to me.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.520
Listen to me!

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
<i>♪ Crazy for crying ♪</i>

44:03.620 --> 44:04.770
You have to stay with Aguilar.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.290
<i>♪ Crazy for crying ♪</i>

44:06.440 --> 44:08.560
Stay in sync with him or it could be dangerous.

44:08.720 --> 44:13.720
<i>♪ And I'm crazy for loving you ♪</i>

44:53.240 --> 44:55.520
Soon they will march on Granada.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.640
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

45:01.880 --> 45:08.650
He'll surrender the Apple and betray
the Creed for the Prince's life.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.920
Love makes us weak.

45:19.160 --> 45:26.160
I would gladly sacrifice my flesh and
my blood so that the Creed lives on.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.530
When I die today don't waste your tears.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.690
The Lord spoke...

46:38.840 --> 46:39.880
...and he said...

46:41.840 --> 46:44.160
...if a man abide not in me...

46:45.320 --> 46:47.480
...he is cast into the fire...

46:48.320 --> 46:50.000
...and he is burned.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.480
For decades...

46:56.840 --> 47:00.730
...you have lived in a land torn apart...

47:01.480 --> 47:03.720
...by religious discord.

47:04.680 --> 47:05.680
But soon...

47:06.840 --> 47:11.520
...thanks to God and the Inquisition...

47:13.000 --> 47:18.080
...we will purge this disease!

47:25.040 --> 47:27.690
The sinners before you...

47:28.440 --> 47:32.720
...sought to defend the heretic Prince of Granada...

47:33.840 --> 47:39.400
...the last heathen stronghold in our holy war.

47:40.560 --> 47:47.090
And so today before our King and Queen...

47:47.400 --> 47:50.230
...I swear that we shall wash ourselves clean...

47:50.240 --> 47:52.440
...in the holy fire of God!

47:56.720 --> 48:01.320
Behold God's will!

48:05.960 --> 48:07.480
You will watch your mentor burn...

48:07.600 --> 48:09.480
...and then you will die the slowest.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.840
Not to ourselves but to the future...

48:29.000 --> 48:30.720
...give glory.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.720
He's synchronizing.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.170
Damned heretics...

49:43.640 --> 49:44.840
...don't let them escape!

49:55.440 --> 49:56.480
Go!

52:40.560 --> 52:41.560
Ha!

55:19.320 --> 55:20.360
Jump!

55:37.160 --> 55:38.160
Complete desynch.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.080
Get him down!

55:42.680 --> 55:44.280
Where are the medics?

55:50.920 --> 55:53.160
It's okay. It's okay, Cal.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.200
Stay with me, Cal.

55:55.360 --> 55:56.720
Stay with me. It's okay. Hurry up!

55:57.920 --> 56:00.650
Okay. Okay. Look at me.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.720
It's okay, look at me.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.760
I can't feel my legs.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.120
The paralysis is temporary.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.680
What's the bad news?

56:45.440 --> 56:46.680
It caused a neurological split,

56:46.760 --> 56:48.120
but we got you through it.

56:49.160 --> 56:50.280
This time.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.000
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

56:57.360 --> 56:58.360
No.

57:00.680 --> 57:04.000
Not if you go in there of your own free will.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.520
I can't do this.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.680
Yes, you can.

57:11.680 --> 57:12.680
The Apple...

57:12.840 --> 57:15.240
...you're the only one left who can find it.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.880
We can put an end to pain, Cal.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.210
For everyone.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.400
Where'd you get this?

57:52.560 --> 57:53.560
My father recovered it...

57:53.600 --> 57:55.220
...from the scene of your mother's murder.

57:55.560 --> 57:57.210
And brought it here for safekeeping.

57:57.520 --> 57:59.240
Safekeeping?

58:01.680 --> 58:03.250
You stole it.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.680
It's your mother's necklace. I wanted you to have it.

58:07.520 --> 58:08.930
Why was he there?

58:09.040 --> 58:10.040
To save her.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.730
From who? Her own people.

58:11.920 --> 58:13.960
What's it got to do with you?

58:14.720 --> 58:16.130
Assassins and Templars...

58:16.240 --> 58:18.720
...have been at war for centuries.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.600
I aim to change that.

58:20.760 --> 58:22.840
That's right, I forgot.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.410
We're here to combat aggression.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.400
I don't think I like your methods.

58:31.720 --> 58:32.800
I'm a scientist.

58:34.160 --> 58:35.520
I'm here to be cured of violence.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.610
Who's gonna cure you?

59:27.200 --> 59:28.800
We're feeding the beast.

59:30.440 --> 59:32.160
We're making him stronger.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.160
I'm Dr. Rikkin.

59:49.880 --> 59:51.000
Alan.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.650
I look after things here in Abstergo.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.000
Like to keep things in the family, huh?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680
Yes.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.920
I'm sorry if we've caused you any discomfort.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.560
Is there anything I can do?

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.080
How about you let me out of here?

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.210
That's something I can't manage.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.880
I'm here to make a deal.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.000
We need the Apple.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.280
And we need you to get it for us.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.840
You've been desynching in the Animus.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.730
We need you not to do that.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.240
Sending me back to the machine?

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.120
No.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.560
You've already shown us what we needed to see.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.560
Will you let us free then?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.400
What do you hope to gain from the newcomer?

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.680
Something that'll benefit us all.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.570
You too, Moussa.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.920
What have you done to them?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.890
It's what happens...

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.720
if you don't enter a regression...

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.650
...of your own volition.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720
Do you recognize this?

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.440
It's an Assassin's blade.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.080
This is the actual one...

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.850
...that your father used to take your mother's life.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.650
He's here, you know.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.120
A mother's death, Cal...

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.090
Not something a boy should ever be made to see.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.920
This is wrong.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.250
You left me no choice.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.170
He has to go in of his own free will, you said that.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.880
I had to negotiate.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.720
You mean manipulate.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.880
I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.200
That's in two days.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.520
He doesn't want to know his past or his father.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.920
He wants to destroy them both.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.880
We're not in the business of creating monsters.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.080
We've neither created them nor destroyed them.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.960
We've merely abandoned them
to their own inexorable fate.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.730
You're your mother's son.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.120
What does that mean?

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.120
The blood that flows through you is not your own.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.440
It belongs to the Creed.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.680
Your mother knew that.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.360
She died so the Creed may live.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.080
Remind me how, exactly.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960
What you saw...

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.840
I did.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.120
You murdered her.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.190
I took her life rather than have it stolen...

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.520
...by that machine.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.320
A man grows with the greatness of his task.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.840
I ought to have killed you.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.200
I couldn't.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.640
Well, here.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.480
Take it.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.280
Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.800
It's in your hands now, Cal.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920
This is what they want.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.120
Spill my blood...

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.160
...but do not go back into the Animus.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.040
Why?

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.720
The Apple...

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.560
...contains the genetic code for free will.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.560
They will use it to destroy us.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.240
I'm gonna find it...

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.960
...and watch them destroy you...

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.810
...and your Creed.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.880
You cannot kill the Creed.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.010
It's in your blood.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.610
The Apple is everything.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.840
Your mother died to protect it.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.760
She had no choice.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.160
I do.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.720
You're gonna kill the Creed!

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800
Take me to the Animus.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.240
Put me in.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.770
Prepare the Animus.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.290
Voluntary regression.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.490
Do you know how Assassins came to be named?

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.760
From an Arabic word.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.040
<i>"Hashashin."</i>

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.480
They were society's outcasts...

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.560
...those who stole...

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.400
...who murdered in cold blood.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.650
People ridiculed them.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.800
Rebels, fools, drug addicts.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.570
But they were wise.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.040
They used this reputation...

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.360
...to hide a dedication to principles...

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.880
...beyond those of even their strongest enemies.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.560
And for that...

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.200
...I admire them.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.400
But you're not one of those men...

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.040
...are you?

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.960
Let's find out.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.359
Commencing regression.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.240
This is my life's work.

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.689
It's my life.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.760
<i>For the Creed.</i>

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.359
<i>Our own lives are nothing.</i>

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.880
<i>All that matters is what we leave behind.</i>

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.770
<i>Sultan...</i>

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.680
<i>Surrender the Apple.</i>

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.280
<i>Your Assassin protectors are gone.</i>

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.850
<i>The Creed is finished.</i>

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.490
<i>My son.</i>

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.960
<i>Here lies the seed of man's first disobedience...</i>

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.880
<i>...of free will itself.</i>

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.690
<i>Thanks to the Apple of Eden...</i>

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.730
<i>...the known world...</i>

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.800
<i>...will be ushered into a new age...</i>

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.320
<i>...one of peace...</i>

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.680
<i>...in which all the warring populations of mankind...</i>

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.050
<i>...shall bow in perfect obedience...</i>

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.800
<i>...to our one Templar rule.</i>

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.910
<i>The Apple.</i>

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.720
<i>Give it to him...</i>

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800
<i>...now.</i>

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.850
<i>For the Creed.</i>

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360
<i>Go.</i>

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.920
<i>Forgive me.</i>

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.720
<i>It's over.</i>

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.640
Leap of Faith !

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600
Where are we?

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.680
It looks like a military port.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.240
Cádiz, Palos de la Frontera.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.800
<i>Assassins have died for this...</i>

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.400
<i>...protect it with your life.</i>

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.640
<i>I am a friend of the Creed.</i>

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.240
<i>Take it to your grave.</i>

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320
<i>I swear.</i>

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.040
What is it? Translation?

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.480
"Following the light of the sun,."

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.120
"I shall leave this old world behind."

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.960
It's Christopher Columbus.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.600
Where is he buried?

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.520
His remains were returned to Spain.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.120
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.730
We found it.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.640
Hey, All Stars. Come here.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.120
Pick one.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.760
Any one.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.160
Breach in the common room!

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.400
Seal the Animus.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.560
Is it a memory?

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320
No.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.920
Come on!

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.600
Transport?

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.120
Standing by.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.640
Protect the Animus. Purge the facility.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.720
I need to get you out of here first.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.280
No!

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.040
We have to leave, Sofia.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.480
No!

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600
No!

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.880
You're not alone, Cal.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.210
You never were.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.400
Wake and bake, my protector. Come on.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.920
Where other men...

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.760
...blindly follow the truth...

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.560
...remember...

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.760
...nothing is true.

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.080
Where other men are limited...

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.040
...by their morality or law...

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.720
...remember...

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.960
...everything is permitted.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.680
We work in the darkness to serve the light.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.000
We are Assassins.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.760
What now, pioneer?

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.720
We fight.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.890
Your Excellency.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.440
All the glory will go to your father.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.360
But we both know who found it.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.720
Your time will come, my child.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.090
They'll give you a Nobel Peace Prize for this.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.200
Better start writing your speech.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.960
I've read yours.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.920
And?

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.240
"If we eradicate free will,
we eradicate the Assassins..."

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:28.130
..."the cancer that has menaced society for centuries."

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.920
It's not my best work...

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.480
...but it gets the point across.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.320
We've been looking for solutions.

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.480
You've eliminated the problem.

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.160
So my program...

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.160
...has brought order to society for the first time.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.200
I'm accountable for this.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.000
You've already been accounted for.

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.160
Our work belongs to the Elders.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.080
This is their finest hour.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.600
You lied to me.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.520
I've always known that in your heart...

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:24.280
...you were a scientist first and a Templar second.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.840
Your recent work has impressed us much...

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.840
...but it has confirmed our belief that mankind...

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.160
...cannot be redeemed.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:35.440
So you've thought of everything.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.000
Not quite. My speech...

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:42.360
...it could do with one of your elegant openings.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.840
"Now I am become death..."

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.280
..."the destroyer of worlds."

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.040
Not sure I could make that work.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.360
<i>It is with great pleasure tonight...</i>

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:17.800
<i>...that I introduce the architect
of our ancient Order's future.</i>

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.400
<i>Please welcome the CEO of the Abstergo Foundation...</i>

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.240
<i>...Dr. Alan Rikkin.</i>

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.400
<i>With the recovery of the Apple...</i>

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.600
<i>...we are now in possession of...</i>

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.440
<i>...a complete genetic roadmap to humanity's instincts.</i>

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.760
<i>Any impulse towards independence...</i>

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.960
<i>...Resistance or rebellion...</i>

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.690
<i>...will be crushed.</i>

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.040
<i>Any predisposition that might oppose...</i>

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.530
<i>...our march of progress...</i>

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.360
<i>...can now be eradicated.</i>

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.880
All I have to do is shout.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.280
I'm here to help you.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.800
And you're here to help me.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.320
I can't help you anymore.

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.800
What about all those great plans?

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.160
Cure violence.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.240
Combat aggression.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.720
That's not going to happen.

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920
You started this, Sophie.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.280
You don't get to walk away.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.520
We both know what happens next.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.960
Not everything deserves to live.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.120
I can't do this.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.120
Yes, you can.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.090
But it is not to ourselves, but to the future...

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.000
...that we must give glory.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.400
A future purged of the Assassin's Creed.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.400
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.440
...the Apple of Eden.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.440
I did this.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.210
I will retrieve the Artifact for the Elders.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.520
Lynch, I want for me.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.760
It is not to ourselves,

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.570
but to the future, that we must give glory.
