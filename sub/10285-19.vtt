WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:05.806
Previously on ER:

00:05.839 --> 00:08.141
I'm actually here
for a job interview.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.078
Why in Sam Hill
would you want to work here?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.146
Finish up. The
hard stuff's done.
Lucien...

00:12.180 --> 00:14.515
We both know you should
never have left that
room this morning.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.418
None of this should be news
to you. This is the job.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.254
So I heard you made the
short list for chief.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.490
I'm in love with you.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.591
Luka moved out.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.727
He what? Why?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.529
Wait a minute.
Honey, wait.
No, I gotta go.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.231
Abby...
What are you doing?!

00:30.264 --> 00:33.167
Don't-Don't.
All right. Sorry.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.636
There, you got us.
Gates is my boyfriend.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.543
Okay...

00:42.576 --> 00:45.579
When I was four...
All right.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.248
I wrote a letter to Ernie

00:47.281 --> 00:49.217
inviting him
to take a bath with me.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.519
That's very
forward of you.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.087
Did he go for it?

00:53.121 --> 00:56.557
No. He was very busy
with Sesame Street.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.559
You do realize
that's code

00:58.592 --> 01:00.294
for "I'm living with
my boyfriend."

01:00.328 --> 01:03.431
No. Actually, he never
even mentioned Bert.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.532
Yeah.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.234
And he wrote me,
like, 20 letters.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.835
Really?
Kind of led me on.

01:07.868 --> 01:11.439
Turned out
that it was my mom.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.874
That's the first nice thing
you've said about your mom.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.145
Yeah, well, she had her moment.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.279
Oh, crap.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.447
What?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.648
We missed our stop.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.716
(both laughing)

01:22.750 --> 01:26.454
Oh...

01:26.487 --> 01:28.556
You know
we're getting into trouble here.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.292
It's Pratt-- he won't care.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.396
(sighs):
Hi, guys.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.566
Hey, I missed you guys.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.501
I missed you.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.636
How was your weekend
with Daddy?

01:42.670 --> 01:44.405
Ah, pretty good.

01:44.438 --> 01:48.176
He'd only eat frozen waffles
and strawberry yogurt.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.378
It's probably the
new environment.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.647
It's okay-- strawberry's
almost a vegetable, right?

01:53.681 --> 01:56.317
Hey, how are you, buddy?

01:56.350 --> 01:57.918
Huh?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.487
Do you want a
cup of coffee?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.789
Uh, no, no,
I'm off caffeine.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.391
Really?

02:03.424 --> 02:06.294
Wow. Good for you.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.329
What happened
to his knee?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.898
Uh, he fell, I think.
You think?

02:10.931 --> 02:13.334
Yeah, I left him with Marnie
for a couple of hours...

02:13.367 --> 02:14.602
It's your first weekend alone
with your son

02:14.635 --> 02:16.204
and you left him
with a babysitter?

02:16.204 --> 02:17.405
Just for two hours, Abby.
Come on.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.539
(knocking on door)

02:18.572 --> 02:20.374
MARNIE:
Hello.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.343
Sorry I'm late.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.377
It's okay.
We just got here.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.845
Oh...

02:24.878 --> 02:26.380
I have to go.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.482
I have to go to work.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.384
Um, here you go.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.652
I have to take the el.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.554
Oh, car still
in the shop?

02:33.587 --> 02:35.723
Yeah, I'm waiting on them to get
some kind of electrical...

02:35.756 --> 02:37.391
thing in stock or something.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.627
Do you need a ride?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.564
Yeah, sure, Gates,
never heard that one before.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.233
Hey, Archie.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.400
Hey, how'd it go?

02:46.434 --> 02:47.468
Well; very well.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.636
I rocked it.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.837
You rocked it?
Rocked what?

02:49.870 --> 02:51.439
His chief interview.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.673
Had Anspaugh eating
out of my hand.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.874
How long did it last?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.243
45 minutes.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.245
Really?
Mine was longer.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.846
Well, part of it was
him showing me the
family scrapbook.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.282
Gates called--
he and Sam are gonna be late.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.716
They had "train trouble."

03:02.750 --> 03:04.718
Oh, and we're supposed
to give them a free pass

03:04.752 --> 03:05.819
because they're an item?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.388
They're just so adorable?

03:07.421 --> 03:08.922
Is that what they think?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.591
Yeah, they did mention
something about that.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.426
I've had it with the
giddy new couple thing.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.795
Greg doesn't get all hoo-hooey
about Betina at work.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.365
Oh, hey,
that reminds me, Frank...

03:17.398 --> 03:18.732
About that guy?
About the thing?

03:18.766 --> 03:19.867
That's today, right?

03:19.900 --> 03:20.934
Yeah, I'm on it, boss.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.303
All right.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.437
So, you two
still shacking up?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.273
Yes, I'm staying with her.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.940
Can't you see I don't want
to hear that right now?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.509
Well, you asked.
Well, I shouldn't have.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.910
I'm down on love.
You and me both.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.479
What, you, the
Internet dating star?

03:31.512 --> 03:32.913
You've only been
online for a month

03:32.946 --> 03:35.349
and you're number four
in all-time "winks."

03:35.383 --> 03:36.450
Don't waste your time.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.818
Online dating blows.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.354
I'm totally over it.
Totally.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.755
Join my monastery, Laverne.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.391
Sign me up.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.293
So you haven't been
out with any of them?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.994
MAN:
Just let me go, you jerks!

03:47.027 --> 03:48.596
Here's one
for you, Neela.
You don't want me here.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.697
I'm like a shark--
I gotta keep moving,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.031
or I'm dead, all right?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.300
Look, you're gonna
get me killed.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.567
Sir...
And her.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.369
And anybody
that's around me.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.604
OFFICER:
Look, if you don't settle down,
You, too.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.871
I'm gonna have
to cuff you.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.007
They showed up
at my mother's funeral,

04:00.040 --> 04:01.609
don't you understand that?
PRATT:
Hey, what the hell is this?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.677
Found him staggering
down on Halstead.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.978
Come on, guys,
what are you doing?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.547
We do not have enough room
in here

04:06.580 --> 04:07.748
to dry out every drunk
in Chicago.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.016
You think you're
safe in here?

04:09.049 --> 04:11.519
Better think again.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.487
NEWKIRK:
Whoa, hey, sir.
Okay, listen up, everybody.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.757
I'm the last guy
you want in your ER.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.731
You can say that again.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:59.733 --> 05:01.902
Make sure they check
the, uh, brake pads.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.371
Right.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.374
Listen, I got you this.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.777
The paper?

05:09.810 --> 05:13.814
It's what you're supposed to get
for the first anniversary.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.489
Okay, um, thanks for the ride.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.400
FRANK:
Yeah, I appreciate it, Lenny.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.968
Now, what's the guy's number?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.405
Yeah, go ahead.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.039
Who you talking to?
Is that our guy?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.141
All right, all right.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.710
Keep up the good work, Frank.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.412
So, what's up with our guy?

05:44.412 --> 05:45.913
You getting him out
of here, or what?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.648
There's something weird
going on.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.949
Weird how?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.918
They sent his name
out on the wire,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
and now my lieu says to keep
him here till further notice.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.922
Great.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.991
Well, guess I'll go make sure
that the king of crime

05:58.025 --> 06:01.695
gets all the resources
that County can muster.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.998
(Pratt sighs)

06:05.032 --> 06:06.066
Nice suit.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.135
Where's the funeral?

06:08.168 --> 06:11.872
Strazynski Manor Chapel,
on South Pulaski.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.974
My mom.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.444
Oh... Oh, sorry
to hear that.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.851
Oh, you know what they say,
you can't go home again.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.986
You from out of town?

06:26.019 --> 06:29.723
Rapid City... where
God left his shoes.

06:29.757 --> 06:33.026
I run a scrap metal yard
for a bunch of hayseed farmers.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.063
I look like Eddie Albert to you?

06:36.096 --> 06:37.765
I really couldn't say.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.933
There's only one place worse
than South Dakota--

06:39.967 --> 06:41.702
North Dakota.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.738
I had to go and move
my whole family there--

06:44.772 --> 06:47.541
my wife, two kids--
and they hate me for it.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.942
I hate me for it.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.811
So, why did you leave then?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.481
I could tell you that, but
then I'd have to kill you.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.084
All systems are go.
He'll be by later.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.719
All right, take it easy,
will you, huh?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.753
Keep it on the low.

06:59.787 --> 07:03.023
My trap is shut.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.093
Guess we both
got a secret, huh?

07:06.126 --> 07:09.530
Get a PCA for our fireman and
pull the drain on the empyema.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.799
Must be fun having her
at your beck and call.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.934
Is it possible for you
to have an interaction

07:13.967 --> 07:15.669
without some kind of
annoying innuendo-y quip?

07:15.703 --> 07:18.506
I need a little time to
prep for the M and M.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.140
I hate those little
teaching things.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.175
Bunch of doctors who like
to hear themselves talk.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.944
Yeah, you should check
one out some time.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.947
Yeah, you might
learn something.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.516
Dolt.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.551
MORRIS:
Excuse me.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.185
Any medications?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.754
Prednisone
and Plaquenil.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.222
She has lupus.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.724
Has she been using
any drugs or alcohol?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.125
We were at a
christening.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.660
Abby, you're with us.
Trauma One.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.961
TAGGART:
He's had half a liter

07:40.994 --> 07:42.996
but he really doesn't
want to be here.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.598
Yeah, well, the
feeling's mutual.
I gotta go,
all right?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.033
Listen, do you have
a cell phone I could use?

07:46.066 --> 07:47.601
I need a cell phone.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.136
Just shoot me
already, all right?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.804
Don't tempt me, man.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.239
Cupcake, can you get this
coconut sack,

07:52.272 --> 07:53.874
or whatever you call it,
off me.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.543
Banana bag.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.810
And let them
arrest me already.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.579
Just get me the
hell outta here.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.980
Calm down.
It's not that simple.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.882
People want me
dead, okay? Dead.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.050
A little Haldol?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.251
Ah, he doesn't need Haldol.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.653
Listen to me.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.754
You look like
a regular girl.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.855
I'm sorry.
Calm down.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.657
Anything happens to me,

08:09.690 --> 08:12.259
will you tell my wife there's
an account in the Bahamas.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.161
Okay.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.765
And will you tell her I'm sorry
that I screwed it all up.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.603
CHUNY:
Sats only 82.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.937
LOCKHART:
Load with a gram of Dilantin.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.205
CHUNY:
I'll go mix it.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.707
If we can't
stop this soon,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.041
we might have to put
a breathing tube in.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.109
What do you mean
if you can't stop this?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.711
You guys need help in here?

08:30.744 --> 08:31.945
No, we're good.
MORRIS: Not really.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.647
Lupus, huh?
Hi, I'm Simon Brenner.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.847
Maybe it'd be better
if we transferred her

08:34.881 --> 08:36.015
to another hospital.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.885
I have money. I can pay.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.153
Don't worry, they're more
competent than they seem.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.590
See? The meds
are kicking in.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.224
Thank God.
Head CT,

08:44.256 --> 08:46.093
metabolic panel, tox screen,
EEG and neuro consult.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.961
Don't you think
that's a bit excessive?

08:47.995 --> 08:51.131
No.
The seizure goes
along with lupus.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.299
First-time seizure
still warrants a workup.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.867
Okay, don't want
to put your mum

08:53.901 --> 08:55.102
through all that
now, do you?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.670
Do what you want.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.806
I don't want you
to miss anything.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.110
Hey, I just saw Moretti
at the desk.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.046
Moretti?
Mm-hmm.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.615
What's he doing here?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.350
CHUNY:
I don't know. Visiting, I guess.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.185
Dr. Moretti,
our old nemesis.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.621
Dr. Gates.
Hello.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.855
Hello, Sam.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.323
Couldn't stay away, huh?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.025
No, no. Had to tie up
a few loose ends.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.627
How's your son doing?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.861
Oh, uh, he's in a group home.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.195
He's doing okay.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.631
TAGGART: That's good
to hear.
Thanks.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.798
Can we help you?

09:24.832 --> 09:27.635
I'm looking for
Art Masterson.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.336
You his parole officer?

09:29.369 --> 09:31.338
Brother-in-law.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.908
He's over there.
Hope you brought a lawyer.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.044
GATES:
Hey, Kevin, does that mean
you're coming back?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.879
MORETTI:
Uh, no.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.749
His mother and I have decided
to stay close to him, so...

09:41.782 --> 09:44.384
TAGGART:
Yeah, I can definitely
understand that.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.219
MORETTI:
Don't look so relieved, Gates.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.022
Excuse me.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.758
GATES:
Hey, no one misses you
like I do, Kev.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.926
MORETTI:
Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.165
(low grunting)

09:58.198 --> 10:00.167
Hey!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.869
Hey! Get off him!

10:01.902 --> 10:03.637
What the hell
are you doing?!
Son of a bitch!

10:03.671 --> 10:04.872
Get off him!
You're dead!

10:04.905 --> 10:06.006
Get the hell off him!

10:06.039 --> 10:07.074
Get off!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.175
(gagging)

10:08.208 --> 10:11.044
Hey!

10:11.078 --> 10:14.882
(gagging)

10:14.915 --> 10:17.217
You should never
have come back, Arnie!

10:17.250 --> 10:18.919
FRANK:
Get him outta here!

10:18.952 --> 10:20.153
MAN:
You should've stayed
where they put you!

10:20.187 --> 10:21.922
All right.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.323
(coughing and gasping)

10:23.356 --> 10:25.058
(sighs)

10:25.092 --> 10:26.927
You okay?

10:28.696 --> 10:32.299
Do you believe me now,
smart guy?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.135
We'll be back to check on you
a little later, Mr. Masterson.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.972
When you're rested.
You can call me Arnie.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.908
I thought you said
your name was Art.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.080
All right, man,
look alive now.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.782
What was that?

10:48.816 --> 10:51.719
Well, the guy's got enemies
it's not hard to see that.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.120
I know, I know,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.955
I'll keep somebody
on him at all times.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.924
Hey, that's a great idea.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.358
Why does it seem like

10:58.391 --> 11:00.027
someone's always getting
punched in this place?

11:00.060 --> 11:01.962
I gave as good
as I got.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.964
I would expect
nothing less.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.900
They find
a new chief yet?

11:06.934 --> 11:08.902
Soon enough.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.938
You...?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.006
Why, is that so crazy?

11:13.040 --> 11:16.109
I'm just pleased they finally
recognized your talent, Greg.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.846
Congratulations.
Thanks.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.948
Appreciate it.
Okay.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.853
Frank, is Dr. Lockhart
on today?

11:25.886 --> 11:28.956
She's in with
a patient.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.358
Okay, thanks.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.360
Your electrolytes look good

11:33.393 --> 11:35.362
and the drug test
came back negative.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.364
Yeah, Mom gave up
the crack years ago.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.000
Shh, Christine.
Let them do their job.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.401
MORRIS:
Cat scan was normal,

11:41.434 --> 11:43.003
no bleed, no abscess.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.271
That's a good sign, right?
Very.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.173
CHUNY: Systolic won't
go up over 80.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.307
LOCKHART:
And she's got
crackles at the bases.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.109
I think
we should get an echo.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.477
I should have had
more children,
Deep breath.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.380
so that be such a bother to you.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.915
Shh.
You're not a burden.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.116
My daughter takes
care of me

11:56.149 --> 11:58.451
all day, then works at night

11:58.485 --> 12:00.120
in a doctor's office.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.454
Just physical therapy,

12:01.488 --> 12:03.456
sports injuries
and stuff.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.993
Skip the echo,
get a spiral CT.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.427
Really?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.096
Yeah, lupus patients are
susceptible to PE.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.031
What?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.800
LOCKHART:
It's just that CHF

12:12.800 --> 12:14.134
is much more likely.
Why don't we just get the echo

12:14.167 --> 12:15.535
and rule it out--
Abby, get the CT.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.504
Let me pull rank on you
while I still can.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.972
Yes, sir.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.173
What's wrong?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.475
I tried to block
my mother's fall

12:22.509 --> 12:23.977
when the seizure
started.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.045
I must have tweaked
something.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.413
Why don't I take a look?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.882
Chuny?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.018
We removed the infected graft
and proceeded with the wash-out.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.519
Did you redose

12:32.552 --> 12:34.087
the antibiotics before
opening the abdomen?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.256
No, she was already on triples.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.058
Well, still, it's
standard practice

12:38.091 --> 12:40.027
to add a dose halfway
through a case.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.394
Did you and your attending

12:41.428 --> 12:43.130
make a conscious decision
not to do this?

12:43.163 --> 12:44.998
Donald, I-I don't see how
your question is relevant,

12:45.032 --> 12:46.834
given that
the acinetobacter

12:46.834 --> 12:48.235
did not originate...
It is relevant

12:48.268 --> 12:50.103
because it is a teaching point

12:50.137 --> 12:52.105
that applies
to abdominal surgeries

12:52.139 --> 12:53.573
in general, and this is

12:53.606 --> 12:55.943
a teaching conference.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.312
Carry on, Dr. Rasgotra.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.481
PRATT:
Excuse me.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.350
OFFICER: And you got
no idea why this guy
was trying to off you?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.852
MASTERSON:
I want to make
a phone call.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.386
I get one phone
call, don't I?

13:06.419 --> 13:07.420
You're not
under arrest.
Well, then arrest me.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.022
I'm not talking to you.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.991
And I want to make
a damn phone call!

13:11.024 --> 13:12.325
All right, why don't
you just back off
for a little while.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.062
Let him calm down.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.064
(gasping):
I don't feel so good.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.899
My chest is tight.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.567
I think I'm having one
of my anxiety things.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.369
Yeah, I can't
imagine why.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.104
Look, there's a reason
I left Chicago.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.073
Let me guess: people were
trying to kill you.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.075
Look, you saved my life.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.342
I can trust you, right?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.511
No, I'd rather you didn't.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.213
Oh, son of a bitch.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.082
Art?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.017
I hear you got yourself
in a little trouble.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.351
Rick.
Who the hell are you?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.320
I'm sorry, Rick.
The cops let you in?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.889
Rick, it was my mother.
You got to understand.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.290
Buff him up, we'll get him
out of your hair.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.158
I'm sorry, it's
not that easy.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.394
I'm not going back there, Rick.
I can take care of myself.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.929
Oh, is that what you've been
doing these past few days?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.063
Sir, you really need
to step outside.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.298
Geez...

13:51.331 --> 13:52.933
What's happening?
I'm dyin'.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.067
(alarms sounding)
You're agitating him.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.202
He's right. You are.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.369
Damn it!

13:56.403 --> 13:58.305
(Masterson groaning)

13:58.338 --> 14:00.240
What do we got?
He's in v-tach.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.076
Charging to 360.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.019
Here's the order
for the spiral CT.
Okay.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.321
Um, could you tell Cards
we might want an echo, too.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.056
Yeah.
Thanks.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.191
Okay.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.464
Hi.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.499
Hi.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.036
Can we talk for a minute?
Let's not.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.104
Look, Abby, I've been
trying to call you.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.207
I know, but it's-- this
is just not really--
not a good time,

14:34.241 --> 14:35.442
because I'm
totally slammed.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.110
Well, then why
are you walking out?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.578
Because I don't
want to do this.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.447
Can I talk to you
for five minutes?
No.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.182
Look, my marriage
is over, okay?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.150
Can you just
leave me alone?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.585
Five minutes.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.420
Abby, I didn't know
about you and Luka.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.422
I'm sorry.
Me, too.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.125
Look, I just wanted
to talk to you

14:52.159 --> 14:54.427
just for a sec,
about the way that I left.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.528
It doesn't matter.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.197
Well...

14:57.230 --> 14:59.099
Look, my kid was
really sick.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.400
Okay?

15:00.433 --> 15:01.969
And-And I lost my footing
for awhile.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.203
I, yes, I know
how that feels.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.604
Trust me.
Yeah.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.507
He was in a... a psych ward
for eight weeks.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.542
Told me
he wanted to die.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.044
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear that.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.612
I am sorry. But...
Thanks.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.315
Anyway, in the middle of it,
his mother and I, you know,

15:15.348 --> 15:17.417
we started talking-- really
talking-- and by the time

15:17.450 --> 15:20.120
he got out of the hospital,
we were a family again.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.155
Well, that's great for you.
It's really, really great.

15:22.189 --> 15:25.158
Look, all I'm trying to say
is that every couple

15:25.192 --> 15:28.161
goes through some awful
and messed-up stuff.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.163
Kevin, are you're feeling
guilty or responsible?

15:30.197 --> 15:31.231
Because you...
'cause you're not.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.532
You don't have to.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.601
I just wanted to tell you
I'm sorry...

15:34.634 --> 15:36.303
You don't have to be sorry.
All you did was help me

15:36.336 --> 15:37.504
ruin my life a little
bit faster, that's it.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.638
I have to go back to work.

15:48.748 --> 15:52.152
(man speaking Hebrew)

15:53.186 --> 15:54.454
"Man is like a breath.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.157
His days are
as a fleeting shadow."

15:57.190 --> 16:02.029
(speaking Hebrew)

16:02.029 --> 16:05.132
"In the morning he flourishes
and grows up like grass.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.101
In the evening, he is
cut down and withers."

16:08.135 --> 16:10.237
(speaking Hebrew)

16:19.246 --> 16:21.314
(door creaking)

16:23.183 --> 16:26.286
Walter?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.230
Walter?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.100
Walter!

16:40.133 --> 16:41.501
What? What is it?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.137
Is the...is the
kitchen on fire again?

16:44.171 --> 16:45.138
Wha...

16:45.172 --> 16:46.639
What?

16:46.673 --> 16:50.343
What's the matter with you?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.345
Why are you you looking
at me like that?

16:52.379 --> 16:55.248
I'm not dead yet,
you lanky bastard.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.084
(laughs)

16:57.117 --> 16:58.551
Pancakes.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.787
I feel like pancakes.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.522
From the good place,

17:02.555 --> 17:05.157
not that greasy spoon
hole in the wall.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.160
I don't think I can
take you out today.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.795
Then go get me some.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.797
And-And one scrambled egg.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.398
Maybe on my break, I will.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.602
Someone's coming
to see me, you know.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.304
No, I didn't.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.473
My nephew.
My brother's son.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.474
Lives in Philadelphia--

17:22.509 --> 17:25.478
a second-rate town
if ever there was one.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.448
People say it's
not a bad city.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.484
People lie.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.586
He's a good kid.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.457
He got a sweet wife,

17:37.490 --> 17:40.460
and, uh,
two little girls.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.496
Kids are great.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.565
Yeah.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.235
My wife and I
never had any.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.270
I regret that.

17:50.303 --> 17:54.307
Sometimes I think
if we had, maybe...

17:54.341 --> 17:56.343
she might have
hung around longer.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.146
How's that?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.148
Well, being a parent,

18:01.181 --> 18:05.452
gives a strength
you didn't know you had.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.221
Places in yourself.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.889
Reserves.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.459
And they can keep you going,
they can, they can, uh,

18:12.492 --> 18:15.595
drive you,
make you fight harder,

18:15.628 --> 18:18.431
soldier on.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.768
Uh, keep rowing upriver.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.871
Even though everything else
turns to crud.

18:28.341 --> 18:32.812
At least,
I've heard that's so.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.650
TAGGART:
Epi's in.
PRATT:
All right, clear!

18:37.684 --> 18:39.652
Back in sinus.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.221
Oh. Look at the ST segments.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.223
Damn. All right,
let's get aspirin, O2,

18:43.256 --> 18:45.192
five of lopressor
and a 12 lead.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.859
What the hell?

18:46.893 --> 18:48.328
We think you're having
a heart attack.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.762
Holy crap!
Is he okay?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.264
I'm having a friggin'
heart attack, Rick!

18:51.298 --> 18:52.865
Maybe you can
back off, huh?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.701
Do you realize how complicated
this is getting?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.204
I'm sorry, I didn't plan on
having a heart attack today!

18:57.237 --> 18:58.705
You gotta
settle down, okay?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.207
Sir, you need to leave
the patient care area.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.874
What a mess.
What happens now?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.410
I'm not talking to you about
this case. Privacy issues.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.278
Listen...
Just wait outside.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.679
I'll talk to you
in a minute.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.781
BP's good, 105/76.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.450
All right, good.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.319
Call the cath lab,
tell them we're on the way.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.688
All right,
thanks, guys.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.889
We'll get this
from here.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.258
What-What are
you doing?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.526
What-What's going
on here?

19:19.559 --> 19:20.827
I-I can't tell you that.

19:20.860 --> 19:21.894
It's privacy issues.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.596
Who the hell are you?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.298
Let's not waste any more time
talking, all right?

19:25.332 --> 19:27.300
Just do the cath thing
so we can get him outta here.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.635
All right,
let me tell you something.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.237
You're in my ER,
and that's my patient,

19:30.270 --> 19:31.871
you do not get to dictate
how this goes.

19:31.904 --> 19:32.939
Actually, I do.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.941
U.S. Marshals Service.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.976
And every minute my guy
sits in this hospital

19:37.009 --> 19:39.312
is putting him and
everyone else here
in jeopardy.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.519
TAGGART:
So, the king of crime
is up in the cath lab?

19:46.553 --> 19:49.922
Yeah.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.892
Hey, so nobody gets in without
double-checking I.D., right?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.894
When in doubt,
keep 'em out.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.263
Anything else I
should know?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.330
No, not right now.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.531
Just keep your eyes open.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.333
These are all yours.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.502
Curtain Three
and Exam Four?

20:02.535 --> 20:03.970
Actually,
the other way around.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.538
Oh.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.973
You good?

20:07.006 --> 20:08.908
Yeah. You?
Yeah.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.577
I'm fine.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.679
All right, see you later.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.253
So, how are things
on the home front?

20:20.287 --> 20:22.422
Well, Sarah's well,
thanks for asking.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.657
I was talking about Sam.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.459
Oh, that.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.362
Well, you know, we're just
having fun right now.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.830
Both kind of busy.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.699
Unclaimed baggage and
whatnot, you know.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.401
So, you're worried
if things don't work out,

20:34.434 --> 20:35.768
it'll turn into a big mess.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.604
Something like that.
I'm here to tell you,

20:37.637 --> 20:38.905
Tony, you're right,
it will.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.640
Come on now.
What?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.041
What, a hothead
Casanova like him

20:42.074 --> 20:43.710
and a feisty little spitfire
like Sam?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.512
You think they have
a snowball's chance in hell?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.947
Hey, Morris, your shoulder
lady's ready in sutures.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.482
Thank you.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.451
Love is hard, boys,
be hard on love.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.786
Seriously, I've been
where you are.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.622
It can work out;
it does work out.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.757
Just take the plunge.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.994
Hey, Pratt.
Yeah?

21:02.028 --> 21:03.996
Did you ever hear
of Arnie Markowitz?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.965
No, why?

21:05.998 --> 21:09.001
What kind of people
can make cops just
disappear like that?

21:09.035 --> 21:10.870
I'll tell you
who: the Feds.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.705
That got me thinking.
Yeah, you see,

21:12.739 --> 21:14.574
now that was your
first mistake.
No.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.609
I wasn't on the force all
that time for nothing.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.645
Read this.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.680
Arnie Markowitz--
busted in '05

21:20.713 --> 21:22.715
for working with
the Turkish Deep State.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.551
Whatever that is. Here.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.785
That is the Mob.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.587
This guy made a deal,

21:27.620 --> 21:29.689
he testified against the
Turks, then he disappeared,

21:29.722 --> 21:31.391
probably into Witsec.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.060
Witsec?
What's Witsec?

21:34.093 --> 21:36.629
Witsec is the witness
security program.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.797
Next page.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.101
So what are you saying,
that my patient Art

21:42.134 --> 21:44.537
Masterson is really this guy
Arnie Markowitz?

21:44.571 --> 21:46.373
Don't say that out loud.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.007
They are everywhere.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.810
Mom's been sick
a long time.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.746
We've got the whole
setup at home.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.081
Any tenderness here?

21:55.114 --> 21:57.450
No, it's fine.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.487
I could never live at home.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.888
I mean, my dad's dead now,

22:01.921 --> 22:04.824
but I got out of there
as fast as I could.

22:04.857 --> 22:05.958
Mmm.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.494
I lived alone for awhile,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.061
but I was never
any good at it.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.663
"Good at it"?
Yeah.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.899
It got boring.
I'm not much of a dater.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.834
You know, I'm not into
playing the game.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.503
Oh, I hear that.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.137
Plus my work makes
it difficult

22:18.170 --> 22:19.939
to have a normal
social life.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.874
Me, too.
I guess that's what we get

22:21.908 --> 22:23.943
for pursuing careers
in medicine, huh?

22:28.581 --> 22:30.683
I'm an escort.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.558
Um...

22:38.591 --> 22:40.560
Could-could I, could I,
uh, could you...

22:40.593 --> 22:43.863
raise your arm
up in the air?

22:43.896 --> 22:45.965
Now try to resist
my pressure.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.872
I thought you said...
Yeah. I was...

22:52.905 --> 22:54.874
I was trying to
finish college

22:54.907 --> 22:56.843
when Mom got sick.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.878
No insurance.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.613
She needed money,

23:00.647 --> 23:02.114
but she also wanted me home

23:02.148 --> 23:04.584
with her during the
day, and... (groans)

23:04.617 --> 23:07.086
Somebody told me
about an agency

23:07.119 --> 23:09.789
where I could work five
to ten hours a week--

23:09.822 --> 23:11.858
nights-- and, uh,

23:11.891 --> 23:14.527
make $10,000 to $15,000.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.897
You'd be amazed

23:17.930 --> 23:20.600
how much men are willing
to pay for the illusion

23:20.633 --> 23:23.002
of a submissive
Asian concubine.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.738
It just sounded
really easy.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.676
DAWN:
Dr. Morris?

23:29.709 --> 23:31.844
It's Mrs. Barcenilla.
We lost her pulse.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.513
Oh, my God.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.114
Page Abby 911.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.949
You might want
to wait outside.
No way.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.485
Her sats suddenly
dropped into the 60s,

23:38.518 --> 23:39.986
and she went into P.E.A.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.521
Oh, my God.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.755
Mig of epi,
mac three and seven-oh.

23:42.789 --> 23:43.923
Mom, please
don't do this!

23:43.956 --> 23:45.658
MORRIS:
Get ready to intubate.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.505
Sorry, we can't
let anybody by.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.907
Hey, you want to get
him out of here, right?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.742
Then you better
let me in there.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.976
It's okay.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.078
Cromley cleared him.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.016
Well, Arnie, there
are no tele beds,

24:10.049 --> 24:13.986
so we're shipping
you back to the ER.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.056
I can't go back,
can't move forward.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.825
I messed up, man.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.661
I did some things
I got in trouble for.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.996
Yeah, you know, I'm
starting to get that idea.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.598
I wasn't much of a lawyer,

24:25.632 --> 24:28.535
but I knew how
to make things work.

24:28.535 --> 24:31.938
My firm had some clients
that needed special help--

24:33.205 --> 24:35.174
Money laundering,
visas, imports,

24:35.207 --> 24:37.143
that type of thing.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.978
Mm-hmm.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.848
Well, when I got snagged,
the Feds came to me and said,

24:41.881 --> 24:43.983
"Do the right thing,
and we'll protect you,

24:44.016 --> 24:45.685
protect your family,"
so...

24:45.718 --> 24:47.286
You did the
right thing.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.556
Did I?

24:49.589 --> 24:52.058
End up trapped
between two worlds,

24:52.091 --> 24:54.661
like ET or something.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.828
Can't be honest with anybody.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.664
Got to hide who you are,

24:57.697 --> 24:58.698
who you were.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.132
I had to teach

25:00.166 --> 25:02.669
my own kid his new name,
drill it into him.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.704
I kept thinking,

25:04.737 --> 25:06.606
this is the price
of being good--

25:06.639 --> 25:08.875
teaching your kid to lie.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.877
He'll understand one day.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.278
Well, he's 12.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.581
He sure doesn't
understand now.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.250
Hey!

25:18.284 --> 25:20.587
Yeah?

25:20.620 --> 25:22.955
Who are you?

25:22.989 --> 25:24.123
I'm Anthony.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.625
I'm restocking the cart.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.228
Where's your I.D.?

25:29.261 --> 25:30.730
I'm new.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.732
So?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.133
They gave me a temp.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.636
Yeah, I must have
left it in my locker.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.705
What the hell
you think you're doing, man?

25:38.738 --> 25:39.906
ANTHONY:
Hey, relax, man.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.007
No, you relax.
Where's the I.D.?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.308
I just started last week!

25:42.341 --> 25:44.043
Then how the hell
did you get in here?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.178
Dr. Pratt, he's one of
our new techs-- take it easy!

26:01.293 --> 26:03.630
Welcome to my life.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.867
I debrided the area and
attempted a primary closure.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.301
Attempted?

26:09.335 --> 26:11.037
Executed.
I executed a primary repair.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.205
KRANE:
Did you consider resection?

26:13.239 --> 26:16.108
RASGOTRA:
Yes, but I thought
the best possible,

26:16.142 --> 26:18.144
um, option was
primary closure.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.112
KRANE:
And Dr. Dubenko
was in agreement?

26:20.146 --> 26:22.982
DUBENKO:
Oh, come on!
Once again,

26:23.015 --> 26:24.984
I remind you
that this patient died

26:25.017 --> 26:27.286
of pan-resistant
bacterial sepsis, which had

26:27.319 --> 26:29.656
nothing to do
with Neela's repair.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.190
CRENSHAW:
No, a concomitant
infection with bowel flora

26:31.223 --> 26:32.992
could have overwhelmed
her immune system.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.061
What are you talking about?
Show me the data.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.996
CRENSHAW:
Her post-op course could
have been influenced by...

26:37.029 --> 26:38.731
You know what?
Reign yourself in, Dusty.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.032
It's getting
embarrassing.
Excuse me?

26:40.066 --> 26:41.400
Yeah, you're
the junior attending.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.135
She's the only person
that you can dump on.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.071
CRENSHAW:
I'm not dumping.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.739
ANSPAUGH:
Sit down, Lucien.
You're out of line.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.174
No, I won't sit down,
and I'm not out of line.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.408
I'm not out
of line at all.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.743
That's a joke.
You want to know

26:50.777 --> 26:52.111
what's out of line?

26:52.144 --> 26:53.746
I'll tell you
what's out of line.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.181
A system so
pathetically underfunded

26:55.214 --> 26:56.883
that we have a single
trauma attending

26:56.916 --> 26:58.050
to cover the
entire hospital

26:58.084 --> 27:00.019
at night--
that's out of line.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.321
Letting a patient bleed
out in the ICU because of

27:02.354 --> 27:04.256
a stupid rule--
that's out of line.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.158
And you want to know what else?
Want to know what else?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.894
Sitting by and watching

27:07.927 --> 27:09.261
my resident
try and hide the fact

27:09.295 --> 27:10.997
that I left her alone
in the O.R.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.865
That's out of line.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.001
It's all out of line.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.703
Radiology read the scan.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.070
Massive embolus
in the left main pulmonary.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.972
That's what you
thought, right?

27:20.006 --> 27:22.742
Right.
Well, fix it.
Can't you fix it?

27:22.775 --> 27:25.778
She's acidotic,
seven point oh-two.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.314
Hold compressions.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.116
Asystole.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.417
CHUNY:
Another epi?

27:31.450 --> 27:32.785
She's on round six.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.822
Resume.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.128
We're running out
of options here.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.264
No. Don't say that.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.734
We've given multiple rounds
of drugs to restart her heart,

27:47.734 --> 27:51.370
but her body has been deprived
of oxygen for too long.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.139
There's always
another option.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.241
That's what you said.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.312
Christine?

28:01.447 --> 28:03.750
Do you want to say good-bye?

28:17.764 --> 28:18.998
Mom, I...

28:19.031 --> 28:21.000
I can't.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.102
Everybody out.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.038
Right now.
Please go.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.775
(flatline tone sounding)

28:36.816 --> 28:38.885
(sobbing)

28:48.961 --> 28:51.130
(crying)

28:59.071 --> 29:01.808
(crying)

29:22.995 --> 29:24.563
Hi. Dr. Kovac, I heard
you were working here,

29:24.596 --> 29:26.899
and I wondered if I might
be able to talk to you...

29:26.933 --> 29:29.301
Oh, you really have the
balls to show up here,

29:29.335 --> 29:31.470
and ask for anything.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.573
Look, I've had a very difficult
time in my life--

29:34.606 --> 29:37.576
Really? Me, too.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.846
I know that, and I'm sorry

29:39.879 --> 29:41.948
for any part that
I've played in it.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.449
But I just wanted
to tell you that,

29:43.482 --> 29:47.453
you know, whatever happened
with me and Abby was...

29:48.988 --> 29:51.991
just the misguided,
messed-up flailings

29:52.024 --> 29:54.460
of two people;
two very troubled people.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.863
That's beautiful.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.000
Look, she loves you.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.335
Anybody can see that.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.271
And as somebody

30:05.304 --> 30:08.307
who has squandered that kind
of thing before in his own life,

30:08.340 --> 30:11.143
I want to implore you not
to make the same mistake.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.444
So, that's...

30:12.478 --> 30:13.946
You done?

30:13.980 --> 30:16.248
Yes, I think...
Yeah, I think so.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.458
Guess I had that coming, huh?

30:26.492 --> 30:28.861
Thanks for
stopping by.

30:31.097 --> 30:33.365
Now, how fast
can he be ready to go?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.301
Well, he's not stable.
He had an MI.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.502
I'm not going anywhere.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.137
Art, you did this
to yourself.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.271
I'm trying to fix it.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.973
Whatever I do, I'm dead.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.441
Dead on the street,
or dead on the inside.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.276
What's the damn difference?

30:44.310 --> 30:46.478
I don't want any of my other
people in here, all right?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.014
Got enough people
in harm's way.

30:48.047 --> 30:51.017
I'll be right back.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.119
Hey, sorry to
pull you out.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.054
No, that's all good.
You all right?

30:55.087 --> 30:56.655
You need something?
No, no, no,
everything is good.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.557
Uh, I just wanted
to let you know,

30:58.590 --> 31:00.126
we're having a family dinner,

31:00.159 --> 31:01.627
and it would be great
if you came.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.429
Okay, yeah.
What's the occasion?

31:05.197 --> 31:07.466
What's this?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.370
(laughs)

31:11.403 --> 31:12.438
You got in!

31:12.471 --> 31:14.373
Yeah!
No way!

31:14.406 --> 31:16.042
Congratulations, man.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.309
That's good stuff.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.477
Ooh! Thank you!
That's good!

31:18.510 --> 31:19.979
A couple months from now,

31:20.012 --> 31:21.413
I'll be a first-year
med student.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.182
Wow.
It's all thanks
to you, Greg.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.517
No, man.
No, no, no, no,
no, that's real.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.687
Dad really wants you to come,
and I'm bringing my guy.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.456
I want you
to meet him.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.591
Oh, yeah? What's Charlie got
to say about that?

31:32.624 --> 31:34.660
He's mellowing out
in his old age,

31:34.693 --> 31:36.595
wanting all the kids around him.

31:36.628 --> 31:39.398
All right, well, I'll come by
as soon as I'm done here.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.399
Thank you.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.533
Good stuff, baby.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.035
Great job.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.971
See you
in a minute.
All right.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.073
Now, we've never lost
a protected witness

31:47.106 --> 31:48.407
who followed protocol,

31:48.440 --> 31:50.509
and we're not ending
our streak with you.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.078
I'm done with testifying.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.380
Okay... then, Art,

31:54.413 --> 31:56.582
you know, I leave now,
and you're out forever.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.151
You ready for that?
On your own?

31:59.185 --> 32:01.153
Well, you ready to do that
to your family?

32:01.187 --> 32:02.721
'Cause you're not
in this alone, you know.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.490
They're in it with you.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.994
All right, look, Arnie,
this is the deal, man.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.296
I'm gonna make sure
that you get fixed up,

32:10.329 --> 32:12.999
but staying here
isn't helping you,

32:12.999 --> 32:14.700
and, in fact...

32:14.733 --> 32:18.004
you're putting other people
in danger, man-- my people.

32:18.004 --> 32:21.207
Look, you did the
right thing once.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.509
Just do it again.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.512
(sighs)

32:31.317 --> 32:33.452
(knocks)

32:50.136 --> 32:53.039
WALTER:
Hey!

32:53.072 --> 32:55.107
You... You've
got my food?

32:55.141 --> 32:56.475
What's going on?

32:56.508 --> 33:00.346
What, this?
It's SOP for leaving.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.614
Wh-What did you
do, step on it?

33:02.648 --> 33:03.715
It's all smashed up.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.218
Whoa. What do you mean,
leaving?
Oh.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.087
Hospice policy.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.422
There's a six-month limit.

33:10.456 --> 33:13.525
My nephew's taking
me to Philly.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.728
They're kicking you out because
you didn't die soon enough?

33:16.762 --> 33:19.431
It's pretty discouraging,
isn't it?

33:19.465 --> 33:22.101
Why didn't you say something?

33:22.134 --> 33:24.136
I didn't want to depress you.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.138
You're depressive enough
as it is.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.207
I don't want to see you bawl.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.342
(quiet laugh)

33:32.378 --> 33:34.513
I'm-I'm s-sorry

33:34.546 --> 33:38.117
I never got to meet your family.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.690
Next time, I...

33:44.723 --> 33:46.625
guess.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.395
Yeah, next time.

33:51.663 --> 33:55.667
Hey... he's taking me fishing.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.138
He says if I row us out,
he'll row us in.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.273
(laughs)

34:06.212 --> 34:08.480
Hey.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.616
Walter.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.721
Don't worry, kid.

34:15.754 --> 34:18.824
You'll figure it out.

34:18.857 --> 34:22.194
I got faith in you.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.244
All right, come on.
Let's hurry up with this thing.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.811
Absolutely, absolutely.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.748
Now, when it comes
to an investment like this,

34:42.781 --> 34:46.217
you have to be concerned
about the four "Cs."

34:46.252 --> 34:48.219
You got your carats,

34:48.254 --> 34:50.356
your color, your clarity

34:50.389 --> 34:52.190
and your cut.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.792
Now, do you want white gold
or do you platinum?

34:53.824 --> 34:56.562
I don't know.
Platinum-- it's
the only way to go.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.530
It-it's the gold standard.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.167
Now, I brought
this especially

35:01.200 --> 35:02.634
with you in mind.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.803
It's a three-stone

35:04.836 --> 35:07.173
platinum setting
with a two-carat

35:07.206 --> 35:08.774
princess cut
in the center.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.377
Top of the line,
a real sweetie.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.678
Here, take
a look at that.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.646
Yeah, let me look at that.
Oh, boy.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.882
Uh, it's a little
on the pricey side,

35:16.915 --> 35:19.451
but for you,
there will be a discount.

35:19.485 --> 35:23.889
Because I understand that
you're a member of the tribe.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.192
What?

35:26.225 --> 35:28.260
I told him you
were part Semite.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.329
Oh.
Who called in the bling man?

35:30.362 --> 35:31.530
Pratt.
Oh, here we go.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.864
What? Frank!

35:32.898 --> 35:35.234
Oh, Betina's
a lucky girl.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.803
Look, everybody just calm down,
all right? I'm only browsing.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.613
(Pratt sings happily)

35:47.646 --> 35:48.847
Hey, Abby!

35:48.880 --> 35:50.782
It's a beautiful
spring day,

35:50.816 --> 35:52.551
the Cubs are playing
at Wrigley Field

35:52.584 --> 35:54.586
and we live in America.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.524
I think I solved the case
of the missing lexapro.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.792
Sorry, I was looking
for some undepressed person

36:00.826 --> 36:02.228
that I could be happy
around and, uh...

36:02.894 --> 36:04.330
You chose me?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.666
Must be slim pickings.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.502
What's the good news?

36:10.536 --> 36:12.538
Eh, you know, things
are just falling into place.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.773
Well, that's great.
You deserve that.

36:15.807 --> 36:16.942
Yeah, you sound thrilled.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.810
I am.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.512
Really.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.816
So what's up with Luka?

36:24.850 --> 36:27.453
I don't know, it's been a month.

36:28.887 --> 36:32.624
Eh, he'll come around.
I know him.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.426
And I know you, too.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.499
Hope you're right.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.733
Just come find me later.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.702
I'll buy you a coffee.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.574
Ah, there he is, my old mentor.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.008
How you been, man?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.877
What you been up to?
Oh, just keeping busy.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.812
It's like an Egyptian
market out here.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.482
Chickens, guys are selling
diamonds at the desk...

36:56.515 --> 36:58.450
Diamonds, really?

36:58.484 --> 37:00.586
Wow, that's weird.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.020
(heavy sigh)

37:02.053 --> 37:04.456
Well, keep it real.

37:04.490 --> 37:05.891
She's in there.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.299
CROMLEY:
It's not a request.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.900
It's not optional.
Unhook him.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.835
Not without
doctor's orders.
Somebody call me?

37:16.868 --> 37:18.637
Keeping him here
isn't helping anybody.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.739
All right, Sam,
give us a minute, okay?

37:24.376 --> 37:25.644
All right,
so what's the plan?

37:25.677 --> 37:27.646
Well, we've got
a facility secured

37:27.679 --> 37:29.581
where he can get medical
care until we regroup.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.317
And I'm gonna have
a tech come over

37:31.317 --> 37:33.018
and expunge the medical record
from your system.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.587
All right.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.055
Hey, Arnie.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.990
How we doing?

37:39.024 --> 37:40.659
Ready to roll.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.861
Good. So, you got everything
you need in the rig?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.430
You don't really care what
happens to him?

37:44.463 --> 37:45.597
PRATT:
Sam.

37:45.631 --> 37:46.998
I got this.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.367
My job is to keep him alive.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.768
That's what I promised

37:49.801 --> 37:50.969
when he came
into the program.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.671
I guess now, my only

37:52.704 --> 37:53.939
concern is him coding
on the way.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.707
Well, we got a paramedic
with us.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.008
Well, why don't you let me
ride along just in case.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.945
No.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.348
Look, if anything, I'll go.

38:02.348 --> 38:03.515
Greg, I have transport training.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.050
Yeah, well, I'm his doctor.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.485
We need you on the floor.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.886
No, Morris can cover.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.521
Aw, are you two
fighting over me?

38:09.555 --> 38:11.523
Look, neither one of you
are coming, okay?

38:11.557 --> 38:13.525
I've got room enough
in the rig for one real

38:13.559 --> 38:15.561
paramedic team and two
of my guys, that's it.

38:15.594 --> 38:16.895
And as soon as we roll out

38:16.928 --> 38:18.730
the door,
this never happened.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.733
This patient was
never here. Get it?

38:28.073 --> 38:29.708
This is crazy.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.643
Don't.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.779
You're the one person who might
actually talk me out of it.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.081
So you're going to walk away
after one bad outcome?

38:36.114 --> 38:38.384
Now, Neela, it's a million
little things.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.552
It isn't like you to give up.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.521
What am I giving up?
What am I giving up?

38:42.554 --> 38:44.055
A dumpy O.R.?

38:44.089 --> 38:46.024
Overnight call?
Below-market pay?

38:46.057 --> 38:48.494
Lucien, you can't abandon me
in the middle of my training.

38:48.527 --> 38:49.761
You're not my responsibility.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.498
This is not what you want.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.065
Don't pretend
to know what I want.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.072
Hi.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.741
Hey.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.410
Are you all right?

39:04.443 --> 39:06.545
What do you care?

39:06.578 --> 39:08.647
Well, that was a pretty tough,
little teaching thing.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.948
Oh, you're worried about me?

39:09.981 --> 39:11.817
Well, you can hold
your own, but yeah.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.486
See, I'm not
a heartless beast.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.722
I never said "beast."

39:16.755 --> 39:20.058
You know what?

39:20.091 --> 39:22.027
I'm not trying to win
a popularity contest here,

39:22.060 --> 39:23.962
but that doesn't mean
I enjoy being treated

39:23.995 --> 39:26.031
like I've crashed
someone's party.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.633
You're the product
of flagrant nepotism

39:27.666 --> 39:28.800
and you're a tosser.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.902
Nobody really wants you here.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.971
Wow!

39:33.004 --> 39:34.773
Uh, don't sugarcoat it, babe.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.107
Don't call me "babe."

39:37.208 --> 39:39.711
You know what your problem is?

39:39.745 --> 39:41.179
No, but you'd
be the first person

39:41.212 --> 39:43.549
I'd go to if I really wanted
to hear it.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.050
You need to get a life.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.818
You need to get out,
which is my polite way

39:46.852 --> 39:48.787
of saying
you need to get laid.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.021
Oh, is that right?

39:50.055 --> 39:51.857
Yeah, I'm pretty
certain of it.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.979
KOVAC: I was thinking
about that night.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.847
That first night
that we kissed

40:15.881 --> 40:17.949
up in the ambulance bay.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.053
You mean the night
I totally geeked out

40:22.087 --> 40:23.822
and kissed you
out of nowhere?

40:24.823 --> 40:26.925
I remember feeling

40:26.958 --> 40:30.862
you were someone who
was so full of hope.

40:32.498 --> 40:35.033
I needed someone to
teach me that again.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.504
I think that
part was mutual.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.071
Did we lose that?

40:40.105 --> 40:43.609
Did we turn into
some other people?

40:44.676 --> 40:46.745
I hope not.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.048
I realized today

40:50.081 --> 40:52.217
I have this idea of us.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.952
Of you and me and Joe,

40:53.985 --> 40:56.822
as something static,
you know, concrete.

40:56.855 --> 40:59.491
But it's not.

40:59.525 --> 41:03.061
It's more like we're
out there on the lake,

41:03.094 --> 41:05.797
on... on choppy water.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.265
Like, uh...

41:07.298 --> 41:08.600
In a rowboat.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.537
Yeah, in a rowboat,

41:11.537 --> 41:13.104
trying to get across.

41:13.138 --> 41:18.076
But when you told me
what happened,

41:18.109 --> 41:20.912
I felt like something died.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.081
I was mourning.
I couldn't see

41:23.114 --> 41:26.552
that what we have is
always changing.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.554
It's moving.

41:28.554 --> 41:29.755
So, for better
or for worse,

41:29.788 --> 41:32.157
as long as
we keep rowing,

41:32.190 --> 41:33.859
we're gonna be okay.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.664
So let's just
get past it.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.632
You know? Let's just
go someplace new,

41:40.666 --> 41:42.267
somewhere nobody knows us.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.235
You know, I know we have
good friends here in Chicago.

41:44.269 --> 41:47.205
I know you've got this
great job you've always...

41:47.238 --> 41:50.275
Do you know that I love you
more than I could ever explain?

42:10.061 --> 42:12.063
Let's get out of here.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.313
Nice bumper sticker,
Bardelli.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.716
Isn't that against regs?
It's not my rig.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.751
Mechanic said something's
wrong with my alternator.

42:32.784 --> 42:35.053
So what if you lose
his pulse, huh?
What if he goes

42:35.086 --> 42:36.688
into v-tach?
I'm good now.

42:36.722 --> 42:37.789
You done enough, Doc.

42:37.823 --> 42:38.890
More than that, actually.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.058
CROMLEY:
You my guy?

42:40.091 --> 42:41.960
BARDELLI: Yep.
Let's roll.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.895
If he goes south en route,
it's gonna come back on us.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.263
Look, we're on
your side, Cromley.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.297
Let us do our job.

42:46.331 --> 42:47.833
Okay, then, we got room

42:47.866 --> 42:49.635
for one more--
who's it gonna be?
