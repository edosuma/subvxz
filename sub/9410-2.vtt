[ Gasps ]

14:18.267 --> 14:19.900
You were right!

14:19.900 --> 14:21.900
Now what?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.900
Let's get out of here.
Okay?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
No way. Come on.
Let's go in.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
Go in?
Are you crazy?

14:28.400 --> 14:31.900
No. Don't even stop to
think about it. Just go.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.567
Wow.

14:43.567 --> 14:46.567
- Where is everyone?
- I don't know.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.967
[ Zapping ]

14:49.967 --> 14:51.400
What was that?

14:51.400 --> 14:55.900
- What was what?
- Didn't you feel that?

14:55.900 --> 14:59.133
I didn't feel anything. Are you
trying to scare me or something?

14:59.133 --> 15:02.133
No.
There was an electrical beam.

15:02.133 --> 15:05.133
I-It shined on me
when I stepped forward.

15:05.133 --> 15:08.533
Let's get out of here.
It's so quiet, it's creepy.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.533
Well, there was a beam sort
of like that

15:10.533 --> 15:13.800
in one of the Avenging Eagle comics.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.400
I think it was issue 4.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.867
It was a beam that led to a parallel
dimension, but it wasn't like that.

15:20.867 --> 15:24.867
I feel like I'm standing
in a giant box of crayons.

15:26.367 --> 15:28.333
I think it's awesome!

15:32.267 --> 15:34.267
[ Skipper ]
Hello!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.133
Is anybody here?

15:41.133 --> 15:43.133
I know what you're thinking.

15:43.133 --> 15:47.133
You think this is the secret
headquarters of the Mighty Mutator.

15:47.133 --> 15:50.633
It's the Masked Mutant.
Can we please get that straight?

15:50.633 --> 15:54.633
And what if it is? How else could
you explain the invisibility curtain?

15:54.633 --> 15:59.133
I can't explain it.
It's weird. It's too weird.

15:59.133 --> 16:03.633
Well, there's only one way
to find out the truth. Right?

16:03.633 --> 16:05.133
No way!

16:09.167 --> 16:11.300
Okay, Libby. Let's go.

16:11.300 --> 16:15.300
You really think a comic book
character can come to life?

16:15.300 --> 16:17.800
That's sad.
That's really sad.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.533
Don't make me cry.
Come on. Let's go.

16:21.533 --> 16:25.033
Okay, but if this Mutant creep
shows up, I'm out of here.

16:25.033 --> 16:28.233

- Hey, we're going down.
- [ Rattling ]

16:37.733 --> 16:41.567
This is going too fast.

We're gonna crash!

Oh, man.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.267
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.733
I pushed "up."
We should have gone up.

- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just--

17:06.967 --> 17:09.967
[ Exhales ]
I feel funny. Kind of tingly.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.833
I'll be okay.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.900
Why doesn't the door open?

17:16.900 --> 17:18.267
Open!

17:18.700 --> 17:21.133
- We're trapped in here.
- Don't worry.

17:21.133 --> 17:23.633
They're just slow.
It'll open. Watch.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.567
We'll be trapped in here forever!

17:25.567 --> 17:28.067
The air will run out!
We'll suffocate!

17:28.067 --> 17:30.400
I can't breathe, Skipper!

17:30.400 --> 17:32.667
I can't breathe!

Oh.

Where are we?

Come on, Skipper.
Let's go back up. Now!

Okay. Calm down.

Do you see any elevators?

I don't see anything.

Maybe the other elevators
don't even come down this far.

- [ Loud Clanking ]
- What's that?

19:02.233 --> 19:05.233
It was the furnace.
It was just the furnace.
