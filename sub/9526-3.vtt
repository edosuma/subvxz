I swear to God.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.083
I've seen his penis, and I've
stuck this finger up his heinie.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.251
One question-
Why would Montez Walker

08:21.376 --> 08:23.962
need to eat healthy
when a Google search showed

08:24.088 --> 08:26.548
Montez Walker having
zero healthy problems?

08:26.673 --> 08:29.051
Sounds to me like
he's a healthy liar.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.844
Jillian Belk
is a real cool chica,

08:30.969 --> 08:32.513

08:36.390 --> 08:38.393

and I'll shop for you.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.065
That's my slogan.
- She made it up herself.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.983
- Let's show some respect.
Waymond!

08:45.109 --> 08:47.778

First question
is for Mr. Walker.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.538
Mr. Walker,
what would be your first act

08:57.663 --> 08:59.289

08:59.414 --> 09:00.624
- Thank you, Bill.

what they need-

09:04.503 --> 09:06.463
Healthy, organic snacks.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.842
- Interesting, because
what we need is someone

09:09.967 --> 09:12.052
who will shop
for what we want.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.388
[light applause]
- Amen.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.473
- Don't you know people
need to be told what they want,

09:16.598 --> 09:18.183
'cause it's actually
what they need?

09:18.308 --> 09:19.601
- Where'd you learn that-

09:19.726 --> 09:21.603
From your wife
that has you on that diet?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.480
- Damn!

09:23.605 --> 09:25.858

I mean, I like being healthy.

I can't do this no more.

- We're voting for Jillian.
- Yes! I won.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.678
- We told Jillian to get
that giant popcorn tin

10:36.803 --> 10:38.013
from Costco, right?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.598
Karl said he wanted it
for Saturday.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.516
- We did, but now that
I'm thinking about it,

10:41.642 --> 10:43.602
I think I forgot to tell her
to get Kirkland jeans.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.729
- I told her.
- Nice.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.315
- I told her to get Kirkland
polos and leather sandals.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.709
- Snatch? What?
- What?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.545
- As break room manager,
I put all snacks

11:10.671 --> 11:12.756
under strict lock and key.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.466
You want a can of soda pop?

Some kind of sick joke?

are those Kirkland jeans?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.522
- Oh, these?
Yeah, they are Kirkland.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.525
And I'm looking like a boss,
though, in head-to-toe Costco.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.318
- They look good.
- You know, boys,

11:33.443 --> 11:35.737
when I went on my listening
tour, the number-one complaint

11:35.862 --> 11:37.948
was that people
were stealing supplies.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.993
So I installed this
high-tech security system.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.327
You see that?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.621
- I'm pissed now!

11:44.746 --> 11:47.874
You t-take the snacks

11:50.294 --> 11:52.546
And that is an order,
starting now. Go!

- Give me those jeans!

11:56.967 --> 11:58.051
- No. Get off.
- Get the jeans.

That means no place
to put our boners,

- I don't know, maybe we should
just get our snacks at 7-Eleven.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.791
That's what we always do.
- What?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.711
- 7-Eleven doesn't have party
tins full of popcorn, okay?

12:32.836 --> 12:34.504
That's what Karl asked for.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.590
All I'm saying is we
are supposed to be living

12:36.715 --> 12:38.842
that crazy Costco life.
- I know.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.011
- I don't know if I've ever
told you guys this story,

12:41.136 --> 12:44.931

when I was a kid.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.017
- Yeah, we've heard that story.
- Yeah.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.436
- It was the most magnificent
experience of my life.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.439
There was giant trampolines
hanging from the ceiling.

15 feet in,

12:58.195 --> 12:59.696

by security.

But it was-

13:01.907 --> 13:04.534
It was, honestly, the best
40 seconds of my life.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.787

13:06.912 --> 13:08.413
- Well, then
why didn't you stop me?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.499
- I didn't stop you
because I like the story,

13:10.624 --> 13:12.417
and it got me jacked up
about some Kirkland jeans

13:12.542 --> 13:13.543

You guys are smarter
than this.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.074
You wanted me
to catch you here.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.868
- Um, what are you
talking about?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.996
- Earlier today, I noticed
you guys were acting

16:36.121 --> 16:38.290
a little strange.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.796
And when Adam confronted me
in the break room...

16:44.921 --> 16:47.090
- Fuck yo' grapes!

16:47.215 --> 16:49.926
- I could tell you were
getting desperate for snacks,

16:50.051 --> 16:52.929
which is probably when Ders
put the plan into action.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.140
- The deal's almost done.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.518
Jillian's dumb ass is never
gonna know what hit her.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.271
- And I got to tell you,
lame attempt

17:01.396 --> 17:03.815
at distracting me, Blake.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.069
I've seen way hairier nipples.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.617
But you did get the vacuum.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.161
That was the first slipup.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.413
My second mistake
was thinking that Adam

17:18.538 --> 17:20.957
could've clogged the toilet
with an empty-stomach dump.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.084
- [imitating flatulence]

17:23.209 --> 17:25.462
Hey. I'm pooping here!

17:25.587 --> 17:28.214
Not.
- Not, indeed.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.175
I'm guessing you shoved
your undershirt

17:30.300 --> 17:32.636
down the pipe to clog it.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.764
But Alice bought the whole
chicken and poodle, didn't she?

17:35.889 --> 17:39.017
- But I'm gonna hire a plumber,
get it fixed.

17:39.142 --> 17:42.437
- Which brings us to
your plumber friend, Karl.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.495
Then that Karl guy
must have gone into the vents...

18:02.123 --> 18:04.626
cut holes behind
every cabinet...

18:10.674 --> 18:13.301
sucked the snacks out
using Blake's shop-vac...

18:19.557 --> 18:21.351
and then taped up
the back of the bags

18:21.476 --> 18:23.728
so they looked untouched...

18:26.940 --> 18:29.401
which means that these-

18:29.526 --> 18:32.153
These chips in here...

18:32.278 --> 18:34.364
are all empty.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.492
So the only thing
I'm left wondering is,

18:37.617 --> 18:40.203
how the hell do you plan
on sneaking the snacks

18:40.328 --> 18:42.163
out of this building?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.499
- All right, guys, I'm all done,
so I'm gonna head out.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.669
I'll see you at my party.
- Later.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.050
- Hey, get over here!

18:54.175 --> 18:56.177
Man in gray,
get back here!

18:56.302 --> 18:57.804
- Aah!

18:57.929 --> 18:59.639
Oh, my God!
Oh. Oh!

18:59.764 --> 19:03.268
- Get over here!
- Oh! Ow!

19:03.393 --> 19:05.603
You made my Discman skip!

19:05.729 --> 19:08.189
- So we should just
steal these snacks, right?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.441
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Cool.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.567
- All right.
- That worked out.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.068
- Here you go.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.987
- That was an incredible plan
that she had.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.281
- <i>Yeah, way more Ocean's Eleven
and Thirteen than</i> ours.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.074
- Yeah.
- But quite frankly, guys,

19:18.199 --> 19:20.577
I think our idea
of pulling the fire alarm,

19:20.702 --> 19:23.621
smashing the locks,
and grabbing all the snacks-

19:23.747 --> 19:25.123
Not a bad plan.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.585
- It was gonna work.
- I love you, dudes.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.420
All right, we got snacks.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.338
- I want my snacks.
I want my crap.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.924
Crap?

19:35.049 --> 19:36.092
Crap!

19:36.217 --> 19:38.094
Busted, busters!

19:38.219 --> 19:40.930
Come on.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.265
Shit.
- Jillian...

19:42.390 --> 19:43.475
where are my Clif bars?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.435

Toilet-

19:45.560 --> 19:46.978
They cut holes
behind every cabinet.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.899
- I asked you for one thing.
one thing!

19:51.024 --> 19:54.277
God, I swear, you are, like,
mentally ill or something.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.945
Give me my Costco card.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.782

19:58.907 --> 20:03.119

'cause you suck dick at life.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.039
