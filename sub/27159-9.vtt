00:05.367 --> 00:08.500
My name is Karla,
and I have Franken-tits.

00:08.533 --> 00:11.767
My breasts are so uneven.
My nipples are pointing down.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.433
Put your hands here and push.
Yeah, exa-- Yeah. Look at that.

00:15.467 --> 00:18.367
We had a dog,
and just like that,

00:18.400 --> 00:21.533
he startled,
took my nose off.

00:21.567 --> 00:25.233
These are tethered cords
that are stretching your skin

00:25.266 --> 00:27.266
all the way from
your collarbone
to your breast--

00:27.300 --> 00:30.567
Still have, like, that feeling
to want to go bigger.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.367
You don't need to have
bigger breasts. They're huge.
They're a spectacle.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.133

00:48.633 --> 00:51.500
My name is Tina,
I'm from Las Vegas,

00:51.533 --> 00:56.467
and I'd really like
Dr. Dubrow to build me
a pigskin corset.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.367
One of the unfortunate
consequences of having
2,000cc breasts

01:00.400 --> 01:04.300
is I have back pain,
and I've noticed
that my breasts sag.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.333
Growing up in Brisbane,
Australia,

01:06.367 --> 01:11.200
there is a lot of emphasis
on having a beach body
all the time.

01:11.233 --> 01:14.633
Me and my sister, Johanna,
were always really close
as kids.

01:14.667 --> 01:18.533
I was two years above her,
but she had bigger boobs
than me,

01:18.567 --> 01:22.266
so I used to buy
lots of padded bras,

01:22.300 --> 01:25.200
chicken filets
that, um, would pad you out.

01:25.233 --> 01:29.266
When I was 20,
I decided to buy
my first breast implants.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.133
I didn't even understand cc's
when I went in
for my first consult

01:33.166 --> 01:35.200
or why you needed to know them.

01:35.233 --> 01:39.300
You don't really.
I got 550cc solid silicone

01:39.333 --> 01:41.367
which, the doctor
explained to me,

01:41.400 --> 01:45.300
would stop my greatest fear,
which would be
an implant rupturing.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.567
After I got
my first set of implants,
I was very excited.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.100
But living in Australia,
it gets fairly hot.

01:51.133 --> 01:54.200
I'd notice,
after spending time
in the sun,

01:54.233 --> 01:57.600
that there was a funny smell
coming out of my implants.

01:57.633 --> 02:00.166
It smells like burnt rubber.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.233
And I didn't know anyone else
with solid silicone implants,

02:04.266 --> 02:07.066
so I thought perhaps
it just was normal,

02:07.100 --> 02:09.333
even though deep down
I knew it wasn't.

02:09.367 --> 02:11.066
And I just ignored it.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.200
After I had gotten married,

02:13.233 --> 02:15.633
I decided to do something
about the smelly implants,

02:15.667 --> 02:20.200
and I really also wanted
to increase my bust.

02:20.233 --> 02:23.133
My husband, at the time,
and I met with
a plastic surgeon.

02:23.166 --> 02:28.100
I got a thousand cc's,
but my husband
was not happy at all.

02:28.133 --> 02:31.333
They weren't big enough,
and they had
pretty bad rippling.

02:31.367 --> 02:35.600
I definitely felt like
I was going to
lose my relationship

02:35.633 --> 02:38.300
if I didn't go along
with my husband's idea

02:38.333 --> 02:40.667
to go up to the 2,000cc's.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.567
My 2,000cc breasts
did not make my ex happy.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.266
He wanted them,
but then when I got them,

02:47.300 --> 02:50.333
he didn't like the attention
that people showed me.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.400
I was getting stopped
in the street.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.133
My Instagram got almost
a million likes,

02:55.166 --> 03:00.133
and that's what sort of led
to the-- the breakup even.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.233
It's crazy.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.333
I'm hoping Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

03:05.367 --> 03:07.633
can build me
an internal corset--

03:07.667 --> 03:09.633
that I can have
some back support

03:09.667 --> 03:12.200
and so my breasts don't sag.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.233
And I think there comes a point

03:14.266 --> 03:17.600
where you don't
even notice anymore
that they're big,

03:17.633 --> 03:20.166
and they're no longer
new and special.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.300
Now I know what cc's are,
and I think that 3,000cc's

03:23.333 --> 03:27.633
would make me the perfect
top-heavy shape.

03:27.667 --> 03:31.300
My name is Jim,
and my dog ate my nose.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.467
I played a lot of sports
growing up, but I really
took to tennis.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.667
I was ranked fourth
in the middle states,
which includes five states.

03:38.700 --> 03:42.166
I was very proud of that.
Marlene and I met
the first day of college.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.233
We fell in love.
We've been married 41 years.

03:45.266 --> 03:49.667
It was October 16th of 2015.
I was playing golf that morning.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.600
Marlene was asleep,
and next to her
was our little dog, Zeus.

03:54.633 --> 03:59.600
I leaned in
to kiss Zeus good-bye,
and he startled.

03:59.633 --> 04:03.400
And I felt blood.
When I got up
and I looked in the mirror,

04:03.433 --> 04:07.600
I realized that
he had just taken
a whole chunk of my nose off.

04:07.633 --> 04:10.266
I screamed, "Call 911."

04:10.300 --> 04:12.667
We get to the hospital,
the doctor said,

04:12.700 --> 04:14.467
"We're taking you
into the operating room.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.300
We're gonna sew
this nose back on."

04:16.333 --> 04:18.734
Within a couple hours
after reattaching my nose,

04:18.767 --> 04:21.533
it started to turn purple.

04:21.567 --> 04:24.233
I spent 11 days
in hyperbaric oxygen.

04:24.266 --> 04:27.734
And the tip survived,
but the sides did not make it.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.500
There was a huge hole
in the side of my nose.

04:30.533 --> 04:35.300
If the tip hadn't survived,
my only option
would've been a forehead flap.

04:35.333 --> 04:39.233
Because the tip survived,
the surgeons discussed

04:39.266 --> 04:41.333
the option of doing
a cheek flap.

04:41.367 --> 04:44.767
The difference between
a forehead flap
and a cheek flap

04:45.000 --> 04:49.467
is that a forehead flap
comes down from the forehead.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.467
It's very unsightly.
And the doctors even told me,

04:52.500 --> 04:54.367
"You're not gonna
wanna go outside."

04:54.400 --> 04:56.333
It made much more sense
to just

04:56.367 --> 05:00.367
cover that hole in my nose
using a cheek flap.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.333
After the cheek flap surgery,
I looked like a monster.

05:03.367 --> 05:07.700
The third surgery
was to try to bring some shape
to this nose,

05:07.734 --> 05:09.767
so they took skin
from the back of my ear.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.266
At that time, they told me
they had taken it
as far as they could take it.

05:13.300 --> 05:17.300
I was shocked, 'cause I was
always thinking that the doctor
was a plastic surgeon,

05:17.333 --> 05:19.600
and he was gonna
make a great nose.

05:19.633 --> 05:22.233
If you look at my nose,
you'll see it's crooked,

05:22.266 --> 05:24.200
it's compressed
on the left nostril.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.333
And on top of that,
I gotta shave my nose,

05:26.367 --> 05:29.600
because this is cheek skin
that grows whiskers.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.767
So, I've seen two doctors.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.533
Both wanted me to do
a forehead flap.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.567
I'm here to see Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

05:36.600 --> 05:39.033
to see if they can offer me
a better option.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.000
Beautiful day for hitting
golf balls, isn't it?
Whoo!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.667
That's great.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.367
I can't wait
till we see Dr. Nassif.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.300
Maybe we can put
the chapter of Zeus behind us.

05:56.333 --> 06:00.667
When I was in the hospital,
Andrew was tasked
with putting Zeus down.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.066
You won't have a reminder
in the mirror every day.
That's right.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.300
I know.
[crying]

06:05.333 --> 06:07.633
Aww.
[crying continues]

06:07.667 --> 06:12.300
[Marlene]
It's really hard talking about
what happened that morning.

06:12.333 --> 06:16.533
When you love somebody,
you never want anybody to go
through anything like that,

06:16.567 --> 06:18.033
including your dog.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.667
I'm looking forward to
[sniffling]

06:19.700 --> 06:21.600
our family being

06:21.633 --> 06:23.734
the same way we were before
all this happened.

06:23.767 --> 06:27.700
Getting my nose fixed
is gonna be closure, I think,
for all of us,

06:27.734 --> 06:29.533
for the whole family.

06:34.567 --> 06:37.000
[Dr. Nassif]
Have you done something special
for your birthday or something?

06:37.033 --> 06:39.533
Well, it's interesting.
When I was a little kid,

06:39.567 --> 06:43.000
if you threw me a birthday party
or sang "Happy Birthday" to me,
I would cry.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.667
I always get embarrassed.
I don't like a lot of attention.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.700
What?
Clearly, I don't have
that problem anymore.

06:49.734 --> 06:51.767
What about you?
What do you like
for your birthday?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.467
I never had a surprise party.
Paul's going to regret

06:54.500 --> 06:57.734
telling me he's never had
a surprise birthday party,
big-time.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.533
Ideal party. Tell me.
Right.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.567
Like, grotto people.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.567
A lot-- Okay, so,
a lot of single girls.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.100
[laughing]

07:05.133 --> 07:07.533
A lot of single girls
and my credit card.

07:07.567 --> 07:10.033
And some champagne.
And champagne.
Okay. Fair enough.

07:10.066 --> 07:12.033
So--
All right-- That'd be nice.

07:12.066 --> 07:15.767
I peeked over your shoulder
when you were reviewing
those pictures.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.567
You've got an interesting
case there.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.734
Jim apparently had
a dog bite to his nose.

07:19.767 --> 07:23.000
He's got
a severe deformity still,
nasal obstruction.

07:23.033 --> 07:24.467
What does it look like?
Let's take a look
at the photos.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.033
Good-looking guy.
Mm-hmm.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.767
[both]
Ohh!

07:29.000 --> 07:32.367
Dude, this is a hard case.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.633
We gotta bring him in.
Yeah.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.734
Can you please send in Jim?

07:35.767 --> 07:37.567
Hey. Hi.
[Dr. Nassif]
Mr. Jim.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.667
I wanted the best doctors
that I could possibly find

07:40.700 --> 07:44.500
to take a look at my situation
and see if they can make

07:44.533 --> 07:46.667
the kind of improvements
that I'd like to see happen.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.333
Give us this interesting story.
Okay.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.367
We, uh--
Are you crying already?

07:52.400 --> 07:55.100
Are you really?
We had a, uh, dog,

07:55.133 --> 07:59.100
and one morning,
went over to put my head close
and say hi,

07:59.133 --> 08:03.000
and just like that,
he startled,
took my nose off.

08:03.033 --> 08:06.400
This is the little guy
that did it.
Ohhh...

08:06.433 --> 08:08.066
Oh, he's so cute.
Sweet boy.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.367
Unfortunately, a dog bite
can cause a lot of damage.

08:11.400 --> 08:16.166
But a family dog?
That also causes a lot
of emotional damage too.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.367
So, you go to the hospital.
Tell us what happens.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.166
Doctor walked in,
and he said, "Jim, we're gonna
sew this nose back on."

08:23.200 --> 08:25.667
What did they tell you
the chances
it would survive were?

08:25.700 --> 08:28.100
They didn't want to say.
The scab was starting
to fall out.

08:28.133 --> 08:32.100
And at that point,
I knew the sides
aren't gonna make it.

08:32.133 --> 08:35.734
And then the forehead flaps
discussion came in.

08:35.767 --> 08:38.567
A forehead flap--
it's fed by a little

08:38.600 --> 08:41.000
blood vessel right here
called the supraorbital.

08:41.033 --> 08:44.000
We lift it up from the skin,
and then bring it down,

08:44.033 --> 08:46.166
and reconstruct
the whole side of the nose.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.767
I was hoping
we can make this work
without a forehead flap.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
[Dr. Nassif]
I mean, this is
a difficult, tough nose.

08:52.033 --> 08:55.033
And what makes it a lot worse
is that Jim

08:55.066 --> 08:57.400
will not let me use
a forehead flap.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.667
I may not be
the right doctor for Jim.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.734
To really complete this
and give you the honest opinion

09:01.767 --> 09:04.133
of what maybe you can get,

09:04.166 --> 09:06.567
we gotta go to the exam room.
Okay.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.633
[Dr. Dubrow]
Have you noticed
that the right breast

09:08.667 --> 09:12.600
has gotten further
displaced upwards?
This one looks more higher.

09:12.633 --> 09:16.567
You have the number one
complication of breast implants,
which is encapsulation.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.500
[Karla]
I'm starting to get worried,

09:18.533 --> 09:20.200
like he can't do
anything for me,

09:20.233 --> 09:23.166
like I just ruined
my body forever.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.433
So what is it you wanna do?

09:25.467 --> 09:28.567
3,000cc teardrop implants.
Less fake.
[frustrated mutter]

09:28.600 --> 09:30.200
You ever heard
the word "oxymoron"?
[Johanna] Yeah.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.533
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

09:38.000 --> 09:40.667
I'm gonna go ahead and examine.
Sure.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.533
Head back, please.
See, this is
what's interesting.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.600
Your right side
is completely collapsed.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.533
Jim's got a double whammy.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.600
I mean, besides the left side
being closed in

09:49.633 --> 09:52.633
because all that tissue's
been pretty much scarred in,

09:52.667 --> 09:55.333
his whole right side's collapsed
because of the pull.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.533
I think I need
to sit down for this.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.166
Okay.
[laughs]

09:59.200 --> 10:02.000
Uh-oh. That's not a good sign.
So, now, let's talk.

10:02.033 --> 10:04.500
The thing that's causing
the nasal obstruction

10:04.533 --> 10:06.633
and the deformity is,
basically,

10:06.667 --> 10:09.767
you don't have enough skin
and soft tissue on the left side
of your nose.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That's the whole thing.
We need soft tissue.

10:12.033 --> 10:14.700
The best way to do that
is with a forehead flap.

10:14.734 --> 10:20.533
If the doctors tell me
they can't do anything
except a forehead flap,

10:20.567 --> 10:24.133
I'm inclined to reject that,
because all I can see

10:24.166 --> 10:27.734
is this trunk
coming down from my forehead.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.000
I just don't want
to go there.

10:30.033 --> 10:32.300
The second way
that may be pretty good

10:32.333 --> 10:35.734
is to take what we call
a composite graft
from your right ear.

10:35.767 --> 10:39.200
It's made out of skin
and cartilage,
with no blood supply.

10:39.233 --> 10:42.533
We put that in this area here,
and then, God willing,

10:42.567 --> 10:47.133
pray and hope that
it builds its own blood supply
within the next few weeks.

10:47.166 --> 10:52.033
If this fails,
the forehead flap is a salvage
which you'll have no choice.

10:52.066 --> 10:56.000
I'm inclined to go
with the composite graft.

10:56.033 --> 10:58.533
Restoring's better function.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.533
Even though there's more risk
with a composite graft,

11:00.567 --> 11:02.333
I think that's
the way to go for me.

11:02.367 --> 11:05.033
Let's do it.
We will see you later,
my friend.

11:05.066 --> 11:07.033
Thanks.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.633
My name is Karla,
I'm 24 years old,
and I have Franken-tits.

11:10.667 --> 11:15.166
They look very uneven.
I feel like one boobs
is up, like, on my collarbone.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.133
The other one's down.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.667
And it's not filled,
like, under.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.367
So it kind of looks like a sock.
It's, like, hanging.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.767
My parents-- they're Colombian.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.133
Growing up in
a Colombian household--
we're just a very close family.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.767
When I was probably 16, 17,
my sister--

11:33.000 --> 11:34.767
she'd be like,
"Why are your boobs like that?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.667
They're, like, droopy."
So, I, like, ran to my mom.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.633
You know, I showed her,
and she was like,
"Stop wearing push-up bras,

11:40.667 --> 11:43.734
"'cause it's pushing it up,
and then when you
take off your bra, it just--

11:43.767 --> 11:46.400
since they're
so used to being up,
they're probably sagging."

11:46.433 --> 11:48.667
And I'm like, "Oh, my God."

11:48.700 --> 11:51.600
That caused a lot
of insecurities for me.

11:51.633 --> 11:54.266
And I have
an older cousin of mine.

11:54.300 --> 11:58.066
She didn't have boobs.
Hers were just, like, ant bites.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.734
She went to Colombia
to get surgery,
and she came back,

12:00.767 --> 12:03.200
and her boobs looked amazing.

12:03.233 --> 12:07.266
She did her boob job
through the armpit
so she didn't have a scar.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.667
And I'm like, "Wow."
Like, "I wanna look like that."

12:09.700 --> 12:12.066
She's like, "Oh, here.
Here's my doctor's information."

12:12.100 --> 12:14.133
I was just so happy.
Like, "Oh, my God," you know?

12:14.166 --> 12:17.066
"Her boobs look great.
Mines are gonna look perfect."

12:17.100 --> 12:19.300
My mom and I flew to Colombia.
The doctor--

12:19.333 --> 12:21.333
he asked me if I had kids,
and I said, "No."

12:21.367 --> 12:23.600
He's like, "Wow, your breasts
are extremely saggy."

12:23.633 --> 12:26.600
So he told me that
I needed a breast lift.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.767
"Okay, I guess that's what
you have to do."

12:29.000 --> 12:31.700
So, as far as I knew,
I was gonna look like my cousin,

12:31.734 --> 12:36.633
with big, nice, perky breasts
and tiny incisions
under the armpit.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.433
And he marks me up.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.100
I should've asked,
"What does this line mean?

12:41.133 --> 12:43.734
What does this do?"
Like, "Why is this here?"

12:43.767 --> 12:47.166
But I was just like,
"Oh, my God, I'm getting--
I'm getting marked up.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.100
I'm really gonna get
my boobs done."

12:49.133 --> 12:51.033
When I got out
the operating room,

12:51.066 --> 12:55.433
I have all this tape
around my areola and down,
like a lollipop.

12:55.467 --> 12:59.400
And I go back to the doctor,
and I'm like,
"Why is all this tape?"

12:59.433 --> 13:02.033
And he's like, you know,
"Those are the stitches
from the incision."

13:02.066 --> 13:05.734
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
Now I'm gonna have these scars."

13:05.767 --> 13:08.200
Like, "Why wasn't it
the same as my cousin's?"

13:08.233 --> 13:10.333
Like, "I told you," you know,
"you needed a breast lift."

13:10.367 --> 13:13.000
I started to panic,
and my mom's like,
"Didn't ask questions?"

13:13.033 --> 13:16.266
I'm like, "I did,
but I didn't know
it was gonna be like this."

13:16.300 --> 13:18.000
I lied.
I didn't ask questions.

13:18.033 --> 13:20.133
That was my problem.
I didn't ask questions.

13:20.166 --> 13:23.133
Ever since the surgery,
my breasts have gotten worse.

13:23.166 --> 13:26.433
Now my breasts are so uneven.
My nipples are pointing down.

13:26.467 --> 13:30.266
The scars are real bad.
My areolas-- so big.

13:30.300 --> 13:34.266
My friends call me Pepperoni.
I'll, like, laugh,
and-- "Ha-ha, joke."

13:34.300 --> 13:36.367
But I'm like, "Oh, my God."
Like, "Why did he do this?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.367
Why did I ruin
my body like this?"

13:38.400 --> 13:41.500
I'm seeking help
from Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

13:41.533 --> 13:45.467
just because I feel like
I haven't had normal boobs

13:45.500 --> 13:48.266
ever since I was young,
when my sister
used to make fun of me,

13:48.300 --> 13:50.700
to now,
my friends making fun of me.

13:50.734 --> 13:54.300
And now it's going even higher
to, like, my intimate life.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.166
I don't wanna actually
ruin my relationship
with my boyfriend, Damien,

13:58.200 --> 14:01.000
just because I'm always hiding.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.433
I'm definitely gonna make sure
to ask questions this time.

14:03.467 --> 14:07.133
I feel like that was
the biggest mistake I ever did

14:07.166 --> 14:09.200
was not to ask questions.

14:13.734 --> 14:15.767
[woman]
So what I'd like you
to focus on for today

14:16.000 --> 14:18.300
is just keeping hands
about shoulder width apart.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.467
So our legs are gonna raise up.
We're gonna press back.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.467
[Tina]
Me and my sister
are trying an aerial yoga class

14:24.500 --> 14:27.500
because I have heard
that it can help
your lower back muscles.

14:27.533 --> 14:32.233
I truly do like trying
to do active stuff,
and it does make me feel good.

14:32.266 --> 14:37.166
To come out, legs stay wide,
slowly coming down.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.367
All right.
So let's give it a try.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.333
Nice!

14:41.367 --> 14:44.400
Aah! It's hard.
It's a lot on the core.

14:44.433 --> 14:47.734
Start to lean back.
Yes, yes, yes.
Keep those legs wide.

14:47.767 --> 14:50.233
Nice! You're almost there!

14:50.266 --> 14:53.200
Aah! Ah. Ah.

14:53.233 --> 14:56.000
That's all you.
[Johanna]
Your boobs look like

14:56.033 --> 14:58.567
they're gonna fall
into your face.
[laughter]

14:58.600 --> 15:02.333
I'm overwhelmed
with frustration.

15:02.367 --> 15:06.767
It's sad to see my sister
morph into this Barbie doll.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.333
Wouldn't this be more fun
if you had more
manageable breasts?

15:10.367 --> 15:13.367
Like, you could do
the tricks, and--

15:13.400 --> 15:15.567
It certainly would,
but at the same time,

15:15.600 --> 15:19.467
I love boobs
more than people love cars
or whatever.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.433
Actually, it was
my family that said,

15:21.467 --> 15:26.000
"You should be seeking out
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif
for a reduction."

15:26.033 --> 15:29.033
However, I really don't have
a reduction in mind.

15:29.066 --> 15:32.567
I feel like talking to them
could, like, bring some--

15:32.600 --> 15:35.100
That's funny, 'cause I feel--
...information to the table.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.333
I feel the opposite.
I feel that talking to them

15:37.367 --> 15:39.767
could maybe finally
let me reach this goal.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.166
No, they're too smart
to condone something this crazy.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.500
You're my best buddy.
You're the greatest surg--

15:47.533 --> 15:49.166
At least the second best
surgeon I know.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.533
[laughter]

15:50.567 --> 15:54.400
So we wanted to make this day
about you.

15:54.433 --> 15:57.000
[laughing]

15:57.033 --> 16:00.367
Today is Jim's surgery,
and there's a lot
of unknowns here.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.233
That's all scar tissue.

16:02.266 --> 16:05.400
You know what?
I can't open the nose like this.

16:05.433 --> 16:09.033
Oh, my God.
I don't know.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.600

16:16.633 --> 16:18.700

16:26.233 --> 16:29.100
Well, thank you, guys.
Happy birthday!

16:29.133 --> 16:33.100
Because Paul told me that
no one's ever thrown him
a surprise birthday party,

16:33.133 --> 16:35.600
I thought, you know,
as his buddy,

16:35.633 --> 16:37.633
I'd make a few arrangements
with his staff

16:37.667 --> 16:40.433
and throw him
a little excitement.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.700
You're my best buddy.
You're the greatest surg--

[Dr. Nassif]
Yes.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.133

Ohh...

16:50.166 --> 16:53.500
So happy birthday.
You're the greatest guy.
We love you.

16:53.533 --> 16:56.367
Okay?
Aw.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.233
I'm very blessed to have
my wonderful staff

16:59.266 --> 17:01.367
especially here
to celebrate my birthday.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.433
And I'll tell you one thing,
it's like one big work family.

17:04.467 --> 17:08.333
We are like family.
We spend probably, like,
15 hours a day together.

17:08.367 --> 17:11.233
Did you get me a cake?
And what kind of cake?

17:11.266 --> 17:12.700
Okay, I'm glad
you mentioned that.

17:12.734 --> 17:16.533
Why don't we
bring the cake out?

17:29.200 --> 17:33.300
But I gotta tell you,
this cake is hilarious.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.400

a rhinoplasty on you--
Yes.

17:36.433 --> 17:39.367
...and you won't let me,

You can practice on that.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.133
Let's go right in the middle
of your nose.
Oh, my God!

17:42.166 --> 17:44.433
Oh, yeah, baby.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.600
It's good, huh?
That is good.

Mm.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.533
[laughter]

17:53.567 --> 17:56.233
[Dr. Dubrow]
Our next patient
is named Karla,

17:56.266 --> 17:58.700
and Karla had surgery
overseas.

17:58.734 --> 18:02.467
You can see
that she had some type
of lift procedure done.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.467
'Cause look at the scarring
around the areolas.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.533
All the areolas
are very wide.
Yeah.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.700
Let's hear what her odyssey was.

18:08.734 --> 18:10.467
Can you please send in Karla?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.467
Hi.
Hi. How are you?
Nice to meet you. Karla.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.567
Nice to meet you. Dr. Nassif.
Terry Dubrow.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.734
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Have a seat, please.

18:18.767 --> 18:22.600
So, are you guys married,
or boyfriend-girlfriend,
or what?

18:22.633 --> 18:25.200
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

18:25.233 --> 18:28.400
If Dr. Dubrow
can help out Karla,
he'll be helping us out,

18:28.433 --> 18:30.567
'cause she wants everything
to be perfect.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.400
I just want her to be
comfortable in her own skin.

18:33.433 --> 18:36.300
Karla, you did not have surgery
in the United States, did you?

18:36.333 --> 18:39.700
I did not.
I had my surgery in Colombia.
Tell us how that happened.

18:39.734 --> 18:42.400
At a very young age,
my breasts started sagging.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.734
Like, what-- what age?
I was probably 14.

18:44.767 --> 18:46.533
Fourteen with saggy breasts?
Fourteen.

18:46.567 --> 18:49.400
So, when my cousin
got her breasts done,
I'm like,

18:49.433 --> 18:52.300
"Oh, my God,
your breasts look amazing.
Where'd you get it done at?"

18:52.333 --> 18:55.500
She's like, "Oh, in Colombia."
So I flew to Colombia
to get my surgery done.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.333
Out of curiosity,
how much did it cost?

18:57.367 --> 19:00.300
$2,800.
Anesthesia,

19:00.333 --> 19:03.367
operating room,
surgeon's fee?
Correct.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.767
Did you get silicone
or saline?
I have silicone.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.400
Wow, because here in the States,

19:08.433 --> 19:12.367
silicone alone--
just the implants--
is about $2,000.
Wow.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.600
When they say the term
"You get what you pay for,"

19:14.633 --> 19:17.367
it really means you really get
what you paid for.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.600
How did things look
in the beginning?
Like, they were uneven.

19:21.633 --> 19:25.567
Have you noticed that
the right breast has gotten
further displaced upwards?

19:25.600 --> 19:29.500
I guess since
this one's dropped,
that this one looks more higher.

19:29.533 --> 19:31.767
It does.
It looks more like
up towards my collarbone.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.400
Is it firm?
Yeah. It's hard.

19:34.433 --> 19:37.400
So you have the number one
complication of breast implants,

19:37.433 --> 19:39.467
which is encapsulation.
Okay.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.700
And that's the body's
immune system reaction

19:41.734 --> 19:43.734
to the foreign body--
the implants.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.734
It puts scar tissue around it.
When that happens,
it pushes the implant up.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.600
[Karla]
I'm starting to get worried,

19:49.633 --> 19:51.467
like he can't do
anything for me,

19:51.500 --> 19:54.000
like I just ruined
my body forever.

19:54.033 --> 19:57.367
What, ideally, are your goals?

19:57.400 --> 20:01.567
To have less of a scar,
a smaller nipple,
and just even breasts.

20:01.600 --> 20:06.767
Why don't we go in, examine you,
and then go from there?
Okay. Sounds good.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.734
[Dr. Dubrow]
Karla's breast situation
is actually very complicated.

20:09.767 --> 20:12.300
The implants are very high.

20:12.333 --> 20:15.533
Her breast tissue is essentially
hanging off them.

20:15.567 --> 20:18.367
And we call that
a "dissociation phenomenon,"

20:18.400 --> 20:21.700
where it looks droopy,
but it actually isn't.

20:21.734 --> 20:24.567
This is a really
challenging case.

20:24.600 --> 20:28.266
First I wanna see if you have
what we call
an "animation deformity."

20:28.300 --> 20:31.367
An animation deformity
is when-- when the muscle

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
is not really
released very well.

20:33.433 --> 20:37.734
It often attaches
to the breast tissue,
and when you flex that muscle,

20:37.767 --> 20:40.700
it makes your breasts
contract along with it.
Oh, yeah.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.333
Is that the situation?
Yeah.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.300
Let me see that.
Put your hands here and push.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.000
Yeah, exa--
Yeah. Look at that.

20:46.033 --> 20:47.467
'Cause you're clearly
under the muscle.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.000
So that's number one. Okay.
Okay.

20:49.033 --> 20:52.533
Number two is
the areolar diameter.
Correct.

20:52.567 --> 20:56.467
The normal areolar diameter
we like to see
is about 38 millimeters.

20:56.500 --> 21:01.133
And yours is... 57.

21:01.166 --> 21:05.300
I need to do
an areolar reduction,
but because of her skin tone,

21:05.333 --> 21:09.500
she has a predisposition
to forming thick, dark scars.

21:09.533 --> 21:13.467
I need to find a way
to minimize the chance

21:13.500 --> 21:17.600
that she will
turn her scars dark
the way she has previously.

21:17.633 --> 21:20.533
Will the scars still
be the same, like, around it?
I'm gonna cut out your scars.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.333
And then the down--
Yes. Yes. But I'm gonna cut
'em out and freshen 'em up.

21:23.367 --> 21:28.400
Should I go smaller?
You should only go smaller
if you wanna be smaller.

21:28.433 --> 21:31.166
I'm just trying to remind myself
just to ask questions,

21:31.200 --> 21:34.333
because I've been
blaming myself
for the last three years.

21:34.367 --> 21:36.734
I feel that if I would've
asked questions,

21:36.767 --> 21:39.567
I could've avoided
this whole situation.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.500
You want implant removal,
replacement,

21:42.533 --> 21:46.066
a revisional lift,
release of the muscle,
removal of some scar tissue.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.066
You want the whole
shooting match, yeah?
Correct.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.500
You sure?
Yes.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.033
All right.
Well, if you're in, I'm in.

21:51.066 --> 21:52.734
Pleasure meeting you.
Great meeting you guys.

21:52.767 --> 21:54.767
Huh? Let's see if we can do
something really nice for you.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.533
Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
All right? Okay.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.367
[Jim]
Hello.
Hi. Good morning.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.100
I'm Jim. I'm here
for my surgery.

22:06.133 --> 22:09.066
I think this surgery
is definitely gonna be

22:09.100 --> 22:13.100
the end of the chapter
on what happened with Zeus,
and we can move on.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.533
I'm looking forward to that.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.633
Jimbo.
Yeah.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.567
How you doing, buddy?
Good.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.633
All right, so, the goal is
for me to try to work some magic

22:21.667 --> 22:23.600
without using the forehead flap.
Yeah.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.166
If I need another flap, though,
I might take your chest

22:26.200 --> 22:28.166
and stitch it up
to your nose too.
Yeah, you're dreaming.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.667
I'll do that.
[laughing]

22:29.700 --> 22:31.367
You're dreaming.
All right, buddy.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.500
The most difficult part
of Jim's surgery today--

22:33.533 --> 22:37.667
it's really,
how do we relieve the pull
of the nose to the left?

22:37.700 --> 22:41.133
We just have to figure out
a way with the composite graft
from the ear--

22:41.166 --> 22:43.200
how to make it work.

22:47.467 --> 22:51.133
Today my team will start
by harvesting rib
and ear composite grafts

22:51.166 --> 22:54.533
while I open up the nose
and do a septoplasty
to straighten the septum.

22:54.567 --> 22:57.433
I'll perform a turbinoplasty
to open up his airway.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.433
Finally, I will use
composite grafts

22:59.467 --> 23:01.734
to reconstruct
Jim's left side of his nose

23:01.767 --> 23:04.400
and reduce any scar tissue
on the left side

23:04.433 --> 23:07.033
caused by his previous
nasolabial flap.

23:07.066 --> 23:09.200
Okay, this is gonna be
a puzzle for me.

23:09.233 --> 23:12.533
Can I have a skin hook,
medium, and a 15 blade?
Let's start.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.033
Oh, God, how am I
gonna open this nose up?

23:15.066 --> 23:19.133
How am I gonna
open up this nose?
That's all scar tissue.

23:19.166 --> 23:22.166
This is really scary,
because as I'm
opening up the nose,

23:22.200 --> 23:26.100
that means I'm cutting along
the nasolabial flap,

23:26.133 --> 23:30.667
and one extra
little millimeter I cut
can kill the whole thing.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.100
If that happens,
it's game over in this case.

23:33.133 --> 23:36.467
You know what?
I can't open
the nose like this.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.600
Oh, my God.
I don't know.

23:40.633 --> 23:43.000
They don't make bigger implants.
You would basically take those

23:43.033 --> 23:44.700
and just add
a thousand more cc's.

23:44.734 --> 23:47.700
So your risk of a rupture
goes through the roof.

23:47.734 --> 23:49.700
I definitely want to go bigger.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.600
Have you lost your [bleep] mind?

23:52.700 --> 23:54.166
I got engaged.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.233
Okay, so that means
wedding dress--

23:56.266 --> 23:57.700
So you're, like,
my god right now.

23:57.734 --> 23:59.734
No extra pressure.
No extra pressure.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.000
[laughing]

24:03.600 --> 24:05.667
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

24:11.000 --> 24:13.767
You know what?
I can't open the nose like this.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.734
Oh, my God.
I don't know.

24:16.767 --> 24:20.166
I usually don't say,
"This is scary,"
with any case.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.567
However, with Jim's,
it's really scary,

24:22.600 --> 24:27.266
because one little wrong move
can kill the nasolabial flap.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.633
If that happens,
stop the surgery,

24:29.667 --> 24:31.266
and then come back
and do a forehead flap.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.266
I'm cutting on the nose.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.300
You know,
this is so scary for me.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.266
Okay. That's l--

24:37.300 --> 24:39.734
That's, like,
two cell layers thick.

24:39.767 --> 24:42.600
Just one wrong move,
and I'm popping
right through the skin.

24:42.633 --> 24:46.600
Nose open. Now let's start
removing the ear cartilage.

24:46.633 --> 24:50.133
Because all that's doing
is adding bulk
to the left side of the nose.

24:50.166 --> 24:53.133
And I'm watching the color
simultaneously

24:53.166 --> 24:56.700
just to make sure we don't have
any dark purple.

24:56.734 --> 24:59.600
If it turns purple,
that means that
blood's backing up,

24:59.633 --> 25:05.166
and that right there can cause
the complete tip side there
just to fail and die.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.667
I'm thinking about
doing something different.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.667
Instead of putting
the composite graft,

25:08.700 --> 25:10.667
you know,
in our usual location,

25:10.700 --> 25:16.033
I wonder if we can actually
make an incision vertically
into the airway.

25:16.066 --> 25:18.033
To open up Jim's
internal lining of his airway,

25:18.066 --> 25:20.233
I'm gonna take
a composite graft

25:20.266 --> 25:23.066
and put it in vertically,
not horizontally.

25:23.100 --> 25:26.367
And that should give more width
and more of an airway for Jim.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.100
Now, since we have
the base of the nose
structured stronger,

25:30.133 --> 25:33.300
now I'm gonna start rebuilding
the actual left side
of the nose.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.200
We're doing the tip
reconstruction,

25:35.233 --> 25:38.233
adding a small lateral
crural strut graft
on the right side.

25:38.266 --> 25:41.000
And then we're doing
a few more "manures."

25:41.033 --> 25:43.734
Did I say "manure"?
Mm-hmm.

25:43.767 --> 25:46.100
A few more maneuvers.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.633
I'm mentally exhausted,
but overall,

25:48.667 --> 25:51.000
aesthetically, I think
his nose looks pretty good.

25:51.033 --> 25:53.700
Okay, so,
I will see you guys later.

25:57.734 --> 25:59.300
Check this out.
Got another one.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.367
Here's Tina.
Oh, jeez.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.600
Very large breast implants.
She's got balloons.

26:03.633 --> 26:06.233
And they're very droopy.
What are those, like,

26:06.266 --> 26:09.200
a thousand?
They look like
a couple thousand to me.

26:09.233 --> 26:10.400
Why don't we bring her in?

26:10.433 --> 26:12.700
Can you please send in Tina?

26:12.734 --> 26:14.700
Hello.
Hi, Tina.

26:14.734 --> 26:16.200
Hi. Nice to meet you.

26:16.233 --> 26:17.600
Nice to meet you.
Dr. Nassif.

26:17.633 --> 26:19.600
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

26:19.633 --> 26:22.633
are very smart-looking doctors.

26:22.667 --> 26:25.734
[laughs]
Like, definitely.

26:25.767 --> 26:29.367
Obviously, you've had some
breast augmentation surgery,
right?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.433
Yes. I have done
three augmentations. I--
[Dr. Dubrow] Three.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.767
I started--
Okay. Where was the first one?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.433
It was in, uh, Brisbane,
Australia.
Okay.

26:37.467 --> 26:41.367
Uh, 550cc. And I thought I would
probably keep them forever.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.300
Then what happened?
It's pretty embarrassing.

26:44.333 --> 26:48.667
I'd be laying on my bed,
and we'd just start to smell
hot plastic.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.233
You were emanating
a burnt silicone smell.

26:51.266 --> 26:53.700
I just sort of tried
to ignore it.

26:53.734 --> 26:57.200
I blamed it on my, um,
boyfriend's feet.

26:57.233 --> 26:58.467
[laughing]

26:58.500 --> 27:00.433
It's theoretically possible

27:00.467 --> 27:04.667
that silicone could get into
the sweat glands of the armpits,

27:04.700 --> 27:06.734
and you could smell plastic.

27:06.767 --> 27:10.300
But it's very rare
and very weird.

27:10.333 --> 27:13.266
My ex had done a lot of--
a lot of research.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.433
Like--
Porn research?

27:14.467 --> 27:16.133
Um--
Like, porn stars?

27:16.166 --> 27:19.367
He had his favorite
big-busted porn stars.

27:19.400 --> 27:23.333
Her ex-husband
is very forcefully,

27:23.367 --> 27:26.033
like, her number one
plastic cheerleader.

27:26.066 --> 27:28.133
I don't think
his intentions were good,

27:28.166 --> 27:30.367
but she wised up
to get away from that.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.367
[Dr. Dubrow]
I never like to hear

27:32.400 --> 27:35.433
when a significant other
of any kind

27:35.467 --> 27:38.767
are planning for a patient
what they want
the patient to have

27:39.000 --> 27:42.200
rather than figuring out
exactly what will make
the patient happy.

27:42.233 --> 27:46.767
Because it probably
isn't really what Tina wanted,
at the end of the day.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.734
They overfilled an 800 bag
to, um, a thousand.

27:50.767 --> 27:53.033
So you had a third surgery
to go larger, yes?

27:53.066 --> 27:55.734
I went back, um, within,
like, the same year, I believe.

27:55.767 --> 28:00.000
And what did they inflate it to?
Um, 2,000cc's.

28:00.033 --> 28:02.166
Eight hundred to 2,000?
To 2,000?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.533
What is your goal now?

28:04.567 --> 28:07.300
By 5:00 p.m. every day,
I feel like I need to lay down.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.033
My back is very sore.
Yeah?

28:09.066 --> 28:10.266
It's bothering you,
the weight?
Yes.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.533
How much do they weigh?
Um, 12.4 pounds,

28:12.567 --> 28:15.367
together on the scale.
[Dr. Dubrow]
The average D-cup breast

28:15.400 --> 28:18.000
weighs approximately two pounds.

28:18.033 --> 28:23.700
So Tina's breasts
weigh more than six times
the average D-cup breast.

28:23.734 --> 28:28.533
And what that means is,
you've got huge breasts.

28:28.567 --> 28:32.066
[laughing]

28:32.100 --> 28:34.000
So what is it you wanna do?

28:34.033 --> 28:36.467
I would-- I would love
for you to be able to do

28:36.500 --> 28:41.000
a, uh, pigskin, or cadaver,
in-built bra

28:41.033 --> 28:44.200
to lift my breasts
and give my back
some sort of support.

28:44.233 --> 28:47.066
It sounds like you even
potentially wanna go bigger.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.367
Uh, yes.
You wanna go to 3,000cc's.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.100
3,000cc teardrop implants.
[frustrated mutter]

28:52.133 --> 28:55.533
That would be my dream number
and anatomical shape.
So, less fake.

28:55.567 --> 28:59.367
So, 3,000cc's,
less fake-looking.
Yes.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.367
You ever heard
the word "oxymoron"?
Yeah.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.400
You ever heard
the expression "jumbo shrimp"?
[chuckles]

29:05.433 --> 29:08.166
Never mind. Um...
[laughing]

29:08.200 --> 29:10.200
[Tina]
I honestly have no idea.

29:10.233 --> 29:14.100
I don't get Dr. Dubrow's joke,
but...
[chuckles]

29:14.133 --> 29:16.333
Why don't we
go in the exam room,
take a look and figure out

29:16.367 --> 29:18.567
what's really going on, okay?
Okay. That sounds great.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.066
Thank you so much.
Okay. Very good. Sure.

29:21.100 --> 29:25.000
What we wanna do
is bring in the leech lady.

29:25.033 --> 29:28.533
Leeches! Blech!

Oh, are you crying?

Here you go.
Thank you.

Okay.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.600
Yeah, look at these.
Is that bad?

30:23.633 --> 30:27.333
These are tethered cords
that are stretching your skin

30:27.367 --> 30:30.233
all the way from
your collarbone
to your breast tissue.

30:30.266 --> 30:35.567
It's pulling down skin
and soft tissue
from the back and neck area,

30:35.600 --> 30:39.500
trying to hold these implants
in place

30:39.533 --> 30:42.500
and not have them burst
through the skin.

30:42.533 --> 30:45.533
First of all,
you're so big

30:45.567 --> 30:48.600
that even if you could
do an internal bra--

30:48.633 --> 30:52.233
each one of these squares
is about $7,000--

30:52.266 --> 30:55.600
it would probably be
an $80,000 investment
Oh, my--

30:55.633 --> 30:57.600
in internal bras.
Oh, my God!

30:57.633 --> 31:00.734
By the way, it also
wouldn't lift you up.
[Tina mutters]

31:00.767 --> 31:04.667
There's no such thing
as an internal support bra

31:04.700 --> 31:07.333
that actually works like a bra.

31:07.367 --> 31:11.266
Right now, you have
taken this to the limit.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.333
You're about to go down
to that place
[no audible dialogue]

31:13.367 --> 31:17.300
where you could easily
turn into a disaster.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.300
They don't make bigger implants.
You would basically take those

31:19.333 --> 31:21.266
and just add
a thousand more cc's.

31:21.300 --> 31:25.300
So your risk of a rupture
goes through the roof.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.567
I definitely am--
still have, like,

31:27.600 --> 31:30.200
that feeling
to want to go bigger.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.233
You need to be healthy
to keep your life

31:34.266 --> 31:37.266
so, like, my children
can have their auntie, like...

31:37.300 --> 31:42.166
But I wanna be able to continue
to do what I'm doing, and--

31:42.200 --> 31:43.767
Oh, are you crying?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.467
You're on, like,
a path to destruction.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.734
I can just foresee an--
an early grave

31:49.767 --> 31:52.700
that could be so easily avoided.

31:52.734 --> 31:55.467
I'm gonna talk to you
kind of more like a dad,

31:55.500 --> 31:57.367
'cause I don't think you're
taking any of this seriously.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.433
Your sister's here crying,
and you're kind of laughing.

31:59.467 --> 32:01.767
Yes, you're not gonna
take it out.
We get that.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.300
You don't need
to have bigger breasts.
They're already huge.

32:04.333 --> 32:06.600
They're huge.
They're a spectacle.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.667
[Johanna]
Shh. Let him finish.
Who cares?

32:09.700 --> 32:12.333
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Then you'll have nothing.

32:12.367 --> 32:15.367
I'm extremely concerned
about what is gonna
happen to Tina.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.633
She hasn't hit rock bottom yet.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.166
If she proceeds
and finds a doctor

32:20.200 --> 32:22.600
to do what she wants,
she will be ruined.

32:22.633 --> 32:26.200
Despite the fact
that we've been pointed,

32:26.233 --> 32:29.767
and intense,
and maybe even aggressive
to a certain degree,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.533
we really just care about you.

32:32.567 --> 32:34.500
Thank you.
And we don't want you

32:34.533 --> 32:37.033
to do something that's going
to end up in a disaster.

32:37.066 --> 32:40.467
I promise you, you will end up
with a disaster.
[Johanna] Listen.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.233
[Tina]
I appreciate all of the advice
that the doctors

32:43.266 --> 32:47.367
and my sister have given me,
but I know that
I am independent,

32:47.400 --> 32:49.734
and smart, and I know that
I'm making good choices.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.400
I know what I need.

32:51.433 --> 32:53.266
We've done everything
we can do.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.467
So we wish you the best.
Thank you.

32:55.500 --> 32:59.767
And I hope that you
make a good decision. All right.
Good luck, you guys.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.700
Hi. Good morning.
Hey, Karla. How are you?

33:11.734 --> 33:13.767
Good. Good.
Um, do I just sign in?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.533
Just sign in, take a seat.

33:15.567 --> 33:17.467
Since meeting with the doctors,

33:17.500 --> 33:19.700
a lot has changed in my life.

33:19.734 --> 33:23.500
Damien proposed to me,
which I'm super excited.

33:23.533 --> 33:26.767
And Dr. Dubrow
can give me my dream breasts.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.667
Gonna help me and Damien,

33:28.700 --> 33:31.433
just because I feel
like I've closed myself
so much with him,

33:31.467 --> 33:36.000
and I wanna go back
to the person
that he fell in love with.

33:36.033 --> 33:37.600
Karla.
[Karla]
How are you?

33:37.633 --> 33:40.000
How are you?
I'm good. I got engaged.

33:40.033 --> 33:42.033
You're kidding me.
[woman]
Congratulations.

33:42.066 --> 33:44.533
[Dr. Dubrow] Congratulations.
That's so great.
[laughs]

33:44.567 --> 33:46.500
Okay, so that means
wedding dress--

33:46.533 --> 33:48.066
Yes.
...anxiety.

33:48.100 --> 33:49.700
So you're, like,
my god right now.

33:49.734 --> 33:53.400
By the way, thanks
for telling that before.
No extra pressure.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.266
No extra pressure.
[laughs]

33:55.300 --> 33:57.533
All right.
So let's do some really good
work today, okay?

34:02.567 --> 34:05.100
For Karla's surgery today,
I will make incisions

34:05.133 --> 34:07.533
through her areolas
and remove her implants.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.667
I will then assess
her right breast pocket

34:09.700 --> 34:11.700
and release the muscle
or scar tissue

34:11.734 --> 34:14.033
that is causing
the animation deformity.

34:14.066 --> 34:16.600
Next, I'll place in
a pair of new implants

34:16.633 --> 34:18.600
and do a revision
of the mastopexy,

34:18.633 --> 34:21.667
making her areolas smaller
and nipples sit higher.

34:21.700 --> 34:26.467
Okay, so we're gonna start
by making an incision
through her areola.

34:26.500 --> 34:31.667
We'll know pretty quickly
whether the surgery
was done improperly

34:31.700 --> 34:35.433
and there's no muscle release,
or whether scar tissue
has forced the implant up.

34:35.467 --> 34:38.633
Yeah.
Inadequate muscle release.

34:38.667 --> 34:43.533
I'm relieved
that Karla's problem was due
to inadequate muscle release,

34:43.567 --> 34:45.567
which is basically
a human error,

34:45.600 --> 34:49.533
rather than having Karla's body
overreact to the implant

34:49.567 --> 34:51.500
by forming scar tissue.

34:51.533 --> 34:55.400
It basically means her chance
of having a good, stable result

34:55.433 --> 34:57.333
is much greater in the future.

34:57.367 --> 35:00.033
Do me a favor. Sit her up.
Let's see what
just muscle release

35:00.066 --> 35:02.133
and nothing else does
to this right breast.

35:02.166 --> 35:05.667
Okay, so I have lowered it
ten millimeters-- a centimeter--

35:05.700 --> 35:08.300
and that actually is probably
as much as you can lower it

35:08.333 --> 35:09.700
without getting
what's called a "double bubble"

35:09.734 --> 35:12.533
or a contour irregularity
in the lower part of the breast.

35:12.567 --> 35:15.533
I don't want to trade
one complication--

35:15.567 --> 35:20.433
inadequate muscle release--
for another: a double bubble.

35:20.467 --> 35:23.400
So it's important to do this
very carefully.

35:23.433 --> 35:26.467
Every millimeter counts
in this operation.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.133
All right.
Let's take the implant out
and see what size it is.

35:29.166 --> 35:31.533
And it's... 350.

35:31.567 --> 35:33.633
Do you have a 350cc implant?

35:36.633 --> 35:39.133
Okay. So there it is.

35:39.166 --> 35:42.066
Ooh, look at that.
The old stitches.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.433
They used permanent stitches
to close her wound.

35:45.467 --> 35:47.600
Yet another different thing
that they do in their country.

35:47.633 --> 35:50.033
The problem
with permanent sutures is

35:50.066 --> 35:52.734
if bacteria attaches to them,

35:52.767 --> 35:57.066
they can form infections,
or they can spit out
the stitches.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.066
So that's the old purse string
they put in.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.600
Here's the knot at the end.

36:01.633 --> 36:05.500
So, that's the way
we used to do it
a long time ago.

36:05.533 --> 36:09.433
So Karla had
a 350cc textured implant
on this side as well.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.600
So we're gonna go ahead
and put the same on both sides.

36:11.633 --> 36:15.767
The only thing that concerns me
is that the right
inframammary crease

36:16.000 --> 36:18.100
is a little bit higher
than the left.

36:18.133 --> 36:20.200
And that's because
I just can't lower

36:20.233 --> 36:23.033
that right any more
without getting a double bubble.

36:23.066 --> 36:26.100
It's really hard
being a perfectionist

36:26.133 --> 36:31.633
and understanding sometimes good
is good enough.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.633
So happy...
till the next impossible case.

36:34.667 --> 36:37.066
Booyah!

36:37.100 --> 36:40.734
This is gonna be a time--
This is it.

36:40.767 --> 36:43.400
...when we will be able
to put it behind us.

36:43.433 --> 36:47.100
Oh, my God! Whoo!
Oh, there he is!

♪ My girl babe ♪
How ya doin', buddy?

37:03.133 --> 37:05.533
It's always great when you
have a supportive family.

37:05.567 --> 37:09.033
In this case,
Jim's got Marlene,
and he's got his son, Andrew.

37:09.066 --> 37:11.734
And they've both got smiles
on their face, and--

37:11.767 --> 37:13.166
It's great.
It's all good.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.734
All right.
Let's take a peek here.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.533
My goal right now is to
just look at his nasal tip

37:18.567 --> 37:22.133
to make sure the skin
on his nasolabial flap
is living.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.734
See how it's a little dusky--
that right there?
[Andrew, Marlene] Yeah.

37:24.767 --> 37:28.467
[Marlene] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The blood flow is backing up
a little bit.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.667
And that's something
that will impede the healing.

37:30.700 --> 37:35.000
So what we wanna do
is bring in our friend,
the leech lady.

37:37.266 --> 37:38.500
Hello!

37:38.533 --> 37:39.734
Leeches?!

37:39.767 --> 37:41.133
Hello.
Hi.

37:41.166 --> 37:42.700
Oh, wow.
[Andrew]
Uh-oh.

37:42.734 --> 37:47.734
I was not ready
to hear "leeches"!

37:47.767 --> 37:49.333
Blech!

37:49.367 --> 37:51.667
I... hate them.

37:56.667 --> 37:59.633
[Dr. Nassif]
How's the leech doing?
[Andrew] He looks good.

37:59.667 --> 38:02.700
I can see that one
getting chubby.
Yeah.

38:02.734 --> 38:04.700
What do you think, buddy?

38:07.333 --> 38:10.200
[Dr. Nassif]
It looks good.

38:10.233 --> 38:13.100
It's a little disgusting,
but if this is what it takes

38:13.133 --> 38:16.266
for the tissue to survive,
I'll be a leech fan.

38:16.300 --> 38:17.633
Have fun.
Thank you.

38:17.667 --> 38:20.133
You guys, we'll see you later.
Yes.

38:20.166 --> 38:23.300
[Marlene]
Wow. I don't think going out
for dinner's a good idea.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.367
[Andrew]
No.

38:30.133 --> 38:33.000
Yeah.
[Jim]
Today, I'm very excited

38:33.033 --> 38:35.000
about having all these
friends and family coming,

38:35.033 --> 38:37.100
because they've followed
the story from day one,

38:37.133 --> 38:39.000
and they're excited
to see the results.

38:39.033 --> 38:40.300
When I look in the mirror now,

38:40.333 --> 38:42.633
I am very happy
with what I see.

38:42.667 --> 38:46.000
I don't have all the memories
that go back to Zeus

38:46.033 --> 38:48.700
and what happened to my nose,
so I feel very good about that.

38:48.734 --> 38:52.066
This is gonna be a time--
[Andrew]
This is it.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.400
...when we will be able
to put it behind us.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.600
Yeah.

38:57.433 --> 39:00.166
Oh, my God! Whoo!
Oh, there he is!

Where's my boy?
Yeah, my boy!

39:16.066 --> 39:20.166
Today marks a new chapter
for Andrew, Jimmy, and I.

39:20.200 --> 39:24.734
We can put the past behind,
and the dog bite,

39:24.767 --> 39:29.233
even though the love for Zeus
will never be gone.

39:29.266 --> 39:33.367
It's been a long road
from when Zeus took my nose.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.033
But we made it.
We made it.

39:36.066 --> 39:38.367
It just makes--
makes me feel so great.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.600
And it's been, like I said,
a long, long journey.

39:41.633 --> 39:46.033
I got a new lease on life,
and I'd like to hit some tennis
balls, if anybody's willing.

39:46.066 --> 39:47.300
[laughter]

39:47.333 --> 39:50.633
Before the surgery,
my dog ate my nose,

39:50.667 --> 39:53.734
left me with a crooked bridge
and a deformed left nostril.

39:53.767 --> 39:57.100
But now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,
my nose is straight,

39:57.133 --> 40:00.700
and I think there's been
some closure
with this whole ordeal

40:00.734 --> 40:04.600
for not only me
but for my wife, Marlene,
and my son, Andrew.

40:04.633 --> 40:08.633
Awesome! Sweet spot.

Awesome!

Like, when she was
under anesthesia?
Before.

40:27.367 --> 40:29.633
Now, Damien, one bit of advice.

40:29.667 --> 40:32.767
What's hers is hers,
and what's yours is hers.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.233
All right. So let me see
what's cooking. [grunts]

40:36.266 --> 40:41.100

I'm like, "Whoo! Yes!
This is what I'm talking about."

40:49.000 --> 40:53.633
So, the concern for you was,
what was causing that implant
to be so high, right?

40:53.667 --> 40:55.233
Yeah.
And was it--

40:55.266 --> 40:58.233
This one?
Yeah. Was it
capsular contracture

40:58.266 --> 41:00.400
or was it inadequately
released muscle?

41:00.433 --> 41:02.333
It was inadequately
released muscle.

41:02.367 --> 41:04.433
Oh, so you were right.
Yeah. Yeah, I was right.

41:04.467 --> 41:08.133
Since Dr. Dubrow
was able to help me,

41:08.166 --> 41:10.767
I am going to invite him
personally to my wedding,

41:11.000 --> 41:15.033

and it has to be Dr. Nassif.

41:15.066 --> 41:17.266

getting engaged. Good move.

that Dr. Dubrow knows

41:48.200 --> 41:50.367
what type of gift
he's given me,

41:50.400 --> 41:52.367
but he did a phenomenal job,

41:52.400 --> 41:55.300
and I will forever
be grateful for Dr. Dubrow.

41:55.333 --> 41:58.333
I feel like I'm me again.
I feel like I'm the Karla

41:58.367 --> 42:01.000
before the first surgery
that I had.

42:03.333 --> 42:06.400
Oh, my God!

42:09.100 --> 42:11.533
[mutters]

42:14.367 --> 42:16.734
Oh, my God.

42:18.066 --> 42:20.500
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

42:20.533 --> 42:24.400
[Karla]
Before Dr. Dubrow
did surgery on me,

42:24.433 --> 42:29.233
I would've not worn
this dress at all,
just because one boob

42:29.266 --> 42:31.266
would've been up here,
the other one
would've been here,

42:31.300 --> 42:33.400
and I would've just been like,
"Uh, no."

42:33.433 --> 42:35.300
Do you think Damien's
gonna like it?

42:35.333 --> 42:38.200
Oh, yeah. Oh, my--

42:38.233 --> 42:42.066
My breasts
used to look very uneven.

42:42.100 --> 42:47.233
One was up by my collarbone
and the other one was lower.

42:47.266 --> 42:49.333
Now they look perfect.

42:49.367 --> 42:53.000
I can't wait to literally
just show them off.

42:53.033 --> 42:56.500
This is the first time
in my life that I've been
happy with my breasts.

42:56.533 --> 42:58.767
I think this is the one.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.433
Do you like it?
Do the girls look good?

43:01.467 --> 43:04.500
You look very sexy.
Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

43:04.533 --> 43:07.433
I've always kind of wanted
to look cartoon-like.

43:07.467 --> 43:10.200
I want, like, a Pikachu nose.
You know, like a Pokéman.

43:10.233 --> 43:14.467
We've seen people that wanna
look like celebrities, aliens,
but never an electric rat.

43:14.500 --> 43:17.166
[woman]
I've been living with
one breast for six years.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.166
You have two millimeters
of soft tissue.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.000
One cell layer too thick,
I'm into her lung.

43:23.033 --> 43:27.266
One cell layer too thin,
I'm gonna kill
the entire area of skin.

43:27.300 --> 43:30.200
I went in for liposuction,
and I woke up with a new nose.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.467
That's a crime, by the way.

43:31.500 --> 43:34.500
That's actually assault
and battery.

43:34.533 --> 43:36.400
