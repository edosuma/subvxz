00:14.389 --> 00:16.516
- Have you packed?
- Yeah, a little bit.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.994
Okay, this is Trinity.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.539
This is their rivals.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.583
She was supposed to do that,
but probably a little more graceful.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.788
I was gonna say,
it didn't look shaky to me.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.126
It's okay, Jerry.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.016
I don't think
any of us are really stressing out,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.227
even though that was probably
one of our worst warm-ups.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.686
But we still believe

18:24.770 --> 18:28.065
that we can make this the best thing
that we've done all season.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.735
We don't win in warm-ups.
We win out there.

19:48.478 --> 19:52.733
You are everything that I wish I could be.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.322
You can do this.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.284
Look up.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.328
Your mom's watching you.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.440
The trainer just said
the injury is really bad...

23:25.404 --> 23:27.948
Will they go up?

23:29.699 --> 23:31.785
You'll have half an hour...

23:32.077 --> 23:33.453
We have flexibility.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.455
We can send you guys
back to the practice room.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.376
...if he's able to go, or rework it.
All right?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.253
Stay right here.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.210
They won't start judging until that.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.922
So, all that beautiful stuff
y'all just put out there...

24:26.006 --> 24:27.007
It's a go.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.008
It's not gonna happen,

24:28.091 --> 24:29.843
but even if a stunt fell,
it wouldn't count?

24:29.926 --> 24:31.052
No, they can't count it.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.765
They gotta judge
from the point it stopped.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.107
Correct,
but we still have to go full-out.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.304
The team that you are against
had some mistakes.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.730
Am I freaking out?

25:23.813 --> 25:26.358
If Monica doesn't freak out,
there's no reason to freak out.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.077
Anyone need to do anything else?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.040
Grab our stuff.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.139
Do not give up. You can do this.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.527
Let me open the Louisville one...

44:52.940 --> 44:55.109
He's gonna have them go back
and do it again.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.402
He's so tough.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.113
But he's tough and good.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.240
He better stay this summer.

45:02.950 --> 45:05.536
Were y'all here the other night?
He signed the contract.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.330
Too bad. Upper levels have him.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.903
You're looking for potential.
