12:59.033 --> 13:00.456
I'm here to install your new modem.

13:00.457 --> 13:01.768
It's Ichabod.

13:01.769 --> 13:04.137
And I thought we
scheduled for Thursday next?

13:05.273 --> 13:07.240
Oops. Got our wires crossed.

13:07.241 --> 13:08.742
Oops.

13:08.743 --> 13:10.243
But I'm here now.

13:10.244 --> 13:12.446
So let's get that Mbps rate blazing.

13:12.447 --> 13:15.048
When I'm through you'll be
able to play your video games,

13:15.049 --> 13:17.317
watch your porn,
and video chat your grandma

13:17.318 --> 13:19.052
- without any lag.
- Right,

13:19.053 --> 13:21.455
well, I'm a little preoccupied now,

13:21.456 --> 13:22.923
so could we reschedule?

13:22.924 --> 13:24.747
CABLE GUY: Are you
available between the hours

13:24.748 --> 13:27.294
of 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
three weeks from today?

13:27.295 --> 13:31.031
If the world hasn't ended
in fiery apocalypse, then...

13:32.166 --> 13:34.134
...yes. Three weeks today.

13:34.135 --> 13:38.138
The torments of the
damned have already begun.

13:39.507 --> 13:41.608
Where were we?

13:44.045 --> 13:47.314
<i>"Ostium apertum...</i>

13:47.315 --> 13:50.117
<i>"Aditum ad Pueros...</i>

13:50.118 --> 13:52.219
<i>Flamma ignis."</i>

13:54.552 --> 13:56.318
CRANE: <i>I know this place.</i>

13:56.792 --> 13:59.594
Valley Forge. Midwinter.

13:59.595 --> 14:01.830
Stands to reason.

14:01.831 --> 14:04.666
This truly was Hell on Earth.

14:06.135 --> 14:08.403
I'm not seeing what you're seeing.

14:10.973 --> 14:14.276
But it is a hell that I know well.

14:14.277 --> 14:16.311
St. Agatha's Orphanage.

14:16.312 --> 14:18.413
Where I was sent after my mother died.

14:21.017 --> 14:23.952
I'm here. As a little girl.

14:23.953 --> 14:25.453
I can see myself.

14:25.454 --> 14:28.523
Sartre was only half right.

14:28.524 --> 14:30.992
Hell is not merely other people.

14:34.197 --> 14:37.999
It is the damned
places we carry with us.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.268
That's some grim real estate.

14:42.505 --> 14:44.839
I can only imagine.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.688
Coming back to this time
you have an opportunity

14:47.689 --> 14:49.044
to revisit who you are...

14:50.713 --> 14:53.715
...and everything you can be.

14:53.716 --> 14:55.350
Some things you can't change, no matter

14:55.351 --> 14:58.053
how far back in time you travel.

14:59.388 --> 15:01.556
Adrift in a time

15:01.557 --> 15:03.625
that is not my own.

15:03.626 --> 15:06.795
Trapped in a world I never made.

15:06.796 --> 15:10.598
Solitude may seem like respite.

15:11.534 --> 15:14.669
But in your younger
self and your mother,

15:14.670 --> 15:17.372
I found comfort.

15:17.373 --> 15:20.909
Please never forget that

15:20.910 --> 15:24.346
in this time, I have not abandoned you.

15:24.347 --> 15:26.548
And I never will.

15:26.549 --> 15:30.018
I mean that as a Witness

15:30.019 --> 15:32.887
and as a friend.

15:34.857 --> 15:37.292
I appreciate that.

15:39.095 --> 15:41.062
Come.

15:41.063 --> 15:44.366
Down to the center of the pit.

15:52.508 --> 15:54.409
LARA: There's a door. Words in Latin.

15:54.410 --> 15:55.910
Yes.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.179
I see it, too.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.181
"Abandon all hope,

16:00.182 --> 16:02.250
ye who enter here."

16:02.251 --> 16:04.886
At least we're in the right place.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.029
Ever since Dreyfuss
started raising Horsemen,

16:14.030 --> 16:16.304
I've been combing through
these history books looking for

16:16.305 --> 16:18.208
anything we could use
against them, and, so far,

16:18.209 --> 16:19.834
nada.

16:19.835 --> 16:22.504
You checked the histories, but, um...

16:22.505 --> 16:25.140
how about the shelf they sit on?

16:25.141 --> 16:26.908
These look more than decorative.

16:26.909 --> 16:28.910
"Sa."

16:28.911 --> 16:32.180
One of the symbols that
let us onto J Street.

16:32.181 --> 16:33.982
It's a switch.

16:33.983 --> 16:35.350
Here, I got these.

16:40.356 --> 16:42.357
It's a hidden volume.

16:43.492 --> 16:45.226
It's dated 1789.

16:47.830 --> 16:50.031
The first entry relates a
meeting between Banneker

16:50.032 --> 16:52.500
and Washington in Sleepy Hollow

16:52.501 --> 16:55.303
at a site of a recently
decommissioned armory.

16:55.304 --> 16:57.417
- Sleepy Hollow? That's your archive.
- JAKE: Uh-huh.

16:57.418 --> 16:59.480
It says here it was redesigned

16:59.481 --> 17:01.170
and improved by Banneker.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.342
Is that Betsy Ross, Samuel

17:06.343 --> 17:07.806
I told you before... no one can know

17:07.807 --> 17:09.025
that she was on that mission.

17:09.026 --> 17:10.913
I'll paint over her, sir.

17:10.914 --> 17:12.714
Keep her distinctive tricorn hat.

17:12.715 --> 17:15.251
We should leave some small
clue that she was there

17:15.252 --> 17:17.420
for future generations.

17:17.421 --> 17:19.021
Yes, sir.

17:19.021 --> 17:20.756
We shall be finished
refitting the Armory

17:20.757 --> 17:22.458
in a matter of months.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.328
A repository for powerful
mystical artifacts

17:25.329 --> 17:26.829
and weaponry to be used

17:26.829 --> 17:29.298
to battle the forces of evil.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.634
Have you considered any
of the agent candidates

17:31.635 --> 17:33.736
I sent your way?

17:35.772 --> 17:37.606
I'd rather not have anyone

17:37.607 --> 17:40.242
in direct connection to public office.

17:40.243 --> 17:42.111
When will you forgive me for the events

17:42.112 --> 17:44.914
that led to Captain
Crane's long slumber?

17:44.915 --> 17:48.417
This place that we have
built together, sir,

17:48.418 --> 17:51.287
is a step in the right direction.

17:51.288 --> 17:53.956
A legacy for future generations.

17:53.957 --> 17:57.460
Are you familiar with the Latin,
"E pluribus unum"?

17:57.461 --> 17:59.762
"From out of many, one."

17:59.763 --> 18:01.497
As in the colonies forming one nation.

18:01.498 --> 18:05.234
As in all peoples forming one people.

18:05.235 --> 18:07.503
I mean for this place...

18:07.504 --> 18:11.607
the Vault... to represent the
best of what our nation can be.

18:11.608 --> 18:13.909
Men and women of all races,
creeds, and beliefs

18:13.910 --> 18:16.612
shall serve its noble cause.

18:16.613 --> 18:20.049
E pluribus unum.

18:20.984 --> 18:23.085
I like it.

18:25.282 --> 18:27.545
Could any of the weapons or
artifacts he was referring to

18:27.546 --> 18:29.291
still be hidden in the Archive?

18:29.292 --> 18:31.592
- Crane and I have been over every inch of that place.
- Wait, no, no.

18:31.593 --> 18:33.562
A later entry posits
that many of the Armory's

18:33.563 --> 18:35.398
greatest treasures were to go

18:35.399 --> 18:38.134
wherever the Agency did.

18:39.503 --> 18:42.104
(Jake shudders)

18:43.740 --> 18:45.307
Their weapons.

18:45.308 --> 18:47.209
What if these are

18:47.210 --> 18:50.046
four of the artifacts
earmarked for use by Agency 355

18:50.047 --> 18:52.481
in times of need?

18:52.482 --> 18:54.416
Bring that over,
let's take a closer look.

19:01.758 --> 19:05.728
(echoing):
I think I finally see bottom.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.097
(echoing):
We must keep our wits about us.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.537
MAN: ♪ <i>Heaven, I'm in heaven</i> ♪

19:14.538 --> 19:17.139
♪ <i>And my heart beats so that ♪</i>

19:17.140 --> 19:19.475
♪ <i>I can hardly speak</i> ♪

19:19.476 --> 19:22.178
♪ <i>And it seems I find</i> ♪

19:22.179 --> 19:25.314

19:25.315 --> 19:27.917

19:27.918 --> 19:31.153
♪ <i>Dancing cheek to cheek.</i> ♪

19:31.154 --> 19:33.689
Welcome to my humble home,

19:33.690 --> 19:35.891
Witnesses.

19:35.892 --> 19:37.593
It took 10,000

19:37.594 --> 19:39.929
wretched souls

19:39.930 --> 19:43.566
an eternity to craft it by hand.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.203
Pleased to meet you.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.569
Are we to assume you are...

19:58.655 --> 20:01.156
the biblical Satan?

20:01.157 --> 20:04.326
The serpent who tempted Eve?

20:04.327 --> 20:06.678
Why box myself in

20:06.679 --> 20:08.246
with definitions?

20:08.247 --> 20:11.083
I'm the Devil you know.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.151
And many you don't.

20:13.152 --> 20:15.987
The one who struck a deal
with Malcolm Dreyfuss.

20:15.988 --> 20:17.756
Before he became immortal.

20:17.757 --> 20:19.524
Now you'll never get that soul

20:19.525 --> 20:21.526
you bargained for.

20:22.929 --> 20:26.331
I have a contract
with Malcolm Dreyfuss.

20:26.332 --> 20:29.367
Hell abides by rules.

20:29.368 --> 20:32.470
We need to find a way
to kill an immortal man.

20:34.674 --> 20:38.510
Why would I help you
kill Malcolm Dreyfuss?

20:38.511 --> 20:40.812
He's bringing down an apocalypse.

20:40.813 --> 20:43.048
I deal in souls in torment.

20:43.049 --> 20:45.250
That would be a...

20:45.251 --> 20:47.552
conflict of interest?

20:47.553 --> 20:49.387
That doesn't bother you
that he cheated you?

20:49.388 --> 20:51.957
Oh, a contract is a contract...

20:51.958 --> 20:53.158
(yawning): is a contract,

20:53.159 --> 20:56.094
and I grow bored of this conversation.

20:57.797 --> 20:59.898
(laughs)

21:07.273 --> 21:10.776
I've never had a
Witness to tear to shreds,

21:10.777 --> 21:13.178
and here we have two

21:13.179 --> 21:14.880
for the price of one.

21:14.881 --> 21:16.581
You cannot keep us here.

21:16.582 --> 21:18.717
We came of our own free will.

21:18.718 --> 21:21.386
And like you said,

21:21.387 --> 21:23.388
Hell has rules.

21:23.389 --> 21:25.224
You cannot trick us

21:25.225 --> 21:27.229
with cheap intimidation.

21:33.599 --> 21:36.234
So...

21:36.235 --> 21:39.271
are we going to pussyfoot around,

21:39.272 --> 21:42.207
or shall we strike a deal?

21:46.612 --> 21:48.780
(laughs)

21:48.781 --> 21:50.715
Alex checked the frame and print

21:50.716 --> 21:52.884
for any runes, sigils,
and symbols, right,

21:52.885 --> 21:55.387
and found a message
written with invisible ink.

21:55.388 --> 21:58.490
Now, with a little help of
copper sulfate and some heat...

21:59.492 --> 22:00.659
Oh!

22:00.660 --> 22:02.394
Voilà.

22:02.395 --> 22:03.562
"E pluribus unum."

22:03.563 --> 22:04.563
And a floor plan

22:04.564 --> 22:06.064
of the Vault,

22:06.065 --> 22:07.933
notated with surveyor marks,

22:07.934 --> 22:10.001
pointing to...

22:16.242 --> 22:18.343
(knocking)

22:18.344 --> 22:21.446
...a spot behind this wall.

22:21.447 --> 22:24.149
Right here.

22:24.150 --> 22:26.451
What?

22:26.452 --> 22:28.386
- (knocking)
- Yeah.

22:28.387 --> 22:31.890
Okay, I've, uh, fought
magical creatures, demons,

22:31.891 --> 22:33.558
and monsters, but...

22:33.559 --> 22:36.828
I've never defaced government property.

22:41.334 --> 22:42.567
Whoa.

22:58.384 --> 23:00.385
I think that's pay dirt.

23:00.386 --> 23:02.454
Yeah.

23:02.455 --> 23:04.990
(creaking)

23:06.325 --> 23:07.826
Okay.

23:12.298 --> 23:15.767
Or we just tore up the
Vault for nothing.

23:16.736 --> 23:18.737
Strange time to remodel.

23:18.738 --> 23:19.738
Oh.

23:19.739 --> 23:22.474
You made it back.

23:22.475 --> 23:25.243
Oh.

23:29.548 --> 23:31.349
LARA: Jobe was trying

23:31.350 --> 23:33.885
to help us, sent us to the right place.

23:33.886 --> 23:34.953
Mm-hmm. So...

23:34.954 --> 23:37.355
you met the man downstairs

23:37.356 --> 23:38.957
Yeah, the Father of Lies.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.892
The freaking Devil himself.

23:40.893 --> 23:43.528
Yes, and he gave us something
that might do the trick.

23:43.529 --> 23:45.030
The Philosopher's Stone.

23:45.031 --> 23:47.365
That turned Dreyfuss immortal.

23:47.366 --> 23:49.029
So, if I can get close
enough to Dreyfuss,

23:49.030 --> 23:51.670
I can use this to reverse
the effects of his immortality

23:51.671 --> 23:53.805
long enough to deliver a mortal blow.

23:53.806 --> 23:55.006
DIANA: On our end,

23:55.007 --> 23:56.241
Banneker hid a trove

23:56.242 --> 23:58.310
of magical weapons in here.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.712
Yeah, I don't know
about magical, though.

24:00.713 --> 24:02.213
ALEX: Yeah, time has

24:02.214 --> 24:04.014
- not been kind.
- Honestly, I don't even know

24:04.015 --> 24:05.878
how we're gonna use these
against the Horsemen.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.314
All right, stop it.

24:09.121 --> 24:11.356
When I first walked
through these doors,

24:11.357 --> 24:14.859
this was Agency 355 by name only.

24:14.860 --> 24:17.362
But we have, every one of us,

24:17.363 --> 24:20.565
restored it to its former glory.

24:20.566 --> 24:24.402
So I ask you today, now...

24:24.403 --> 24:26.571
trust me.

24:26.572 --> 24:28.873
God's blood, trust each other.

24:28.874 --> 24:32.243
Because if Banneker
bequeathed these armaments

24:32.244 --> 24:35.747
to the original heroes of our agency...

24:35.748 --> 24:39.584
then "age shall not weary them,

24:39.585 --> 24:41.786
nor the years condemn."

24:41.787 --> 24:44.255
And with these in our hands,

24:44.256 --> 24:46.124
I have no doubt,

24:46.125 --> 24:47.959
as one,

24:47.960 --> 24:50.695
we can only prevail.

24:59.038 --> 25:02.574
(chuckles) We've got
Secret Service men in choppers,

25:02.575 --> 25:04.976
Rangers in the woods,

25:04.977 --> 25:08.179
and we've got you,

25:08.180 --> 25:11.182
my most glorious warrior.

25:11.183 --> 25:15.086
You are so close to
crushing them with your...

25:15.087 --> 25:16.921
not-at-all-proverbial

25:16.922 --> 25:19.791
iron bootheel. (cackles)

Go walkabout for a bit.

38:19.291 --> 38:21.625
Get my head on straight.

38:21.626 --> 38:23.327
Right.

38:23.328 --> 38:24.728
(sighs)

38:34.005 --> 38:38.075
Our fates are intertwined,
Ichabod Crane.

38:38.076 --> 38:42.046
Sooner or later, we'll be
seeing each other again.

38:42.047 --> 38:45.149
Of course we will.

38:53.859 --> 38:57.128
CRANE: <i>Lara has gone.</i>

38:57.129 --> 39:01.632
She's traveling the world
she helped to save.

39:01.633 --> 39:04.668
And find her place within it.

39:04.669 --> 39:06.971
I really wanted to meet her.

39:06.972 --> 39:08.839
I know, sweetheart.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.641
I'm sure she felt the same way.

39:10.642 --> 39:13.677
It's just... complicated.

39:13.678 --> 39:15.479
Molly.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.715
You're free.

39:17.716 --> 39:20.151
When you grow up, you can choose

39:20.152 --> 39:23.053
to fight evil...

39:23.054 --> 39:25.322
or not.

39:27.492 --> 39:29.527
And the Witness mantle?

39:32.264 --> 39:34.899
I don't have it anymore.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.202
But you bore it

39:38.203 --> 39:41.972
with bravery and aplomb
well beyond your years.

39:41.973 --> 39:46.477
Miss Molly is not the only one free.

39:48.079 --> 39:50.781
Without the Witness mantle, you...

39:50.782 --> 39:52.583
I don't have to do this anymore?

39:52.584 --> 39:56.854
You were right when you
said I found my calling.

39:58.790 --> 40:01.659
We're a family.

40:07.265 --> 40:10.134
(phone vibrates)

40:10.135 --> 40:11.936
It's Jenny.

40:11.937 --> 40:15.139
Something called a Siren may
be singing its song at sea?

40:15.140 --> 40:16.707
Right.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.509
Homework. Dinner.

40:18.510 --> 40:19.777
And then <i>The Bachelor.</i>

40:19.778 --> 40:21.045
Ooh, yeah.

40:21.046 --> 40:23.547
I'm kidding, old man.

40:23.548 --> 40:24.682
(laughs)

40:24.683 --> 40:26.317
(mutters)

40:26.318 --> 40:29.620
Miss Jenny said the creature
was sighted in this vicinity.

40:31.356 --> 40:33.224
We're partners, right?

40:33.225 --> 40:35.326
Partners tell each other everything?

40:35.327 --> 40:37.094
Yes.

40:37.095 --> 40:39.697
How did you get that piece
of the Philosopher's Stone

40:39.698 --> 40:40.998
from the Devil?

40:41.933 --> 40:45.102
I... struck a bargain with him.

40:45.103 --> 40:48.105
I know enough about the supernatural

40:48.106 --> 40:51.241
to know that the Devil
only bargains for one thing.

40:56.014 --> 40:58.115
(gasps

40:58.116 --> 41:00.985
A lien on my soul.

41:00.986 --> 41:02.286
Payable in the event

41:02.287 --> 41:04.021
of my death.

41:04.022 --> 41:05.990
Your soul... are you kidding me?

41:08.126 --> 41:10.594
I'm sorry, what was that?

41:10.595 --> 41:12.997
Situation dire.

41:12.998 --> 41:15.332
Prognosis grim.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.167
No, Agent Thomas.

41:17.168 --> 41:19.737
Another day at the office.

41:19.738 --> 41:21.372
How can you be so flippant?

41:21.373 --> 41:24.375
You might have just damned yourself.

41:24.376 --> 41:27.444
I have learnt a very
important lesson over the years.

41:27.445 --> 41:30.781
One that is reflected in the
heart's blood of this nation.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.683
Work hard,

41:32.684 --> 41:34.785
stay true,

41:34.786 --> 41:38.255
surround yourself with
people you love and respect,

41:38.256 --> 41:40.591
and there's nothing you cannot achieve.

41:40.592 --> 41:42.993
So this?

41:42.994 --> 41:44.762
I'll fix this.

41:44.763 --> 41:46.096
No.

41:46.097 --> 41:47.731
<i>We</i> will fix this

41:47.732 --> 41:49.333
together.

41:49.334 --> 41:52.269
I have no doubt.

41:53.905 --> 41:57.174
Now, is that the siren call

41:57.175 --> 41:58.509
of duty I hear?

41:58.510 --> 42:00.177
(groans): Cheap.

42:00.178 --> 42:01.579
Siren.

42:01.580 --> 42:02.803
That's like a Succubus, right?

42:02.804 --> 42:03.781
No, it is not.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.182
The daughters of Achelous,

42:05.183 --> 42:08.385
the Sirens would lure
sailors to their doom.

42:08.386 --> 42:11.922
I had a roommate like that in college.

42:11.923 --> 42:13.357
Right.

42:13.358 --> 42:15.626
Well, a little wax in the ears,
lashed to a mast,

42:15.627 --> 42:17.130
and we'll be home in time for supper.

42:17.131 --> 42:18.565
You're the monster expert.

42:19.464 --> 42:22.066
(screeches and roars)

42:24.736 --> 42:27.004
Right.

42:27.005 --> 42:28.339
That is not a Siren.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.341
That is a Kraken.

42:30.342 --> 42:32.176
Are you sure?

42:32.177 --> 42:34.011
Sure it wasn't a Bakunawa

42:34.012 --> 42:36.013
or Scylla and Charybdis?

42:36.014 --> 42:38.682
Well, somebody's been cramming.

42:38.683 --> 42:41.185
No, I am the monster expert,
you are the law enforcement.

42:41.186 --> 42:42.653
That is a Kraken.

42:42.654 --> 42:44.755
I'd stake my reputation
as a Witness on it.

42:44.756 --> 42:46.924
That is a bet I will take.

42:46.925 --> 42:49.059
Excellent.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.328
Shall we punch the clock?

42:51.329 --> 42:55.299
♪ <i>I'm on the highway to hell ♪</i>

42:55.300 --> 42:58.602
