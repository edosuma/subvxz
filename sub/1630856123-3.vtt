You say how woman is

00:16.550 --> 00:17.985
a woman, a...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.487

00:19.520 --> 00:21.455
Never do you mention

00:21.489 --> 00:23.824

00:36.270 --> 00:39.307
This half-wit shot up a filling

You say tiger...

01:09.036 --> 01:11.139
that's a different guy.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.973
It cost you three times.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.975
Did they take her? The police?

01:15.008 --> 01:16.644
[Munch]
Fled on foot.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.946
Possibly home.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.514
Possibly to the wind.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.916
-Will you find her?
-It's a question

01:22.950 --> 01:24.518
of price.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.621
And the job,
it was not the job

01:27.655 --> 01:28.922
you said.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.492
-Pain... and suffering.
-[grunting]

01:32.460 --> 01:35.095
And it forces a man to ask...

01:35.129 --> 01:38.065
why you want the tiger.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.800
She's my wife.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.769
She made vows to me.

01:41.802 --> 01:45.373
Consider it a debt unpaid,
leaving me in limbo.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.942
See, she hid from me
nine, ten years.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.711
Interest accrued

01:50.744 --> 01:53.981
until the debt could
no longer be paid with money.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.883
Then, one day, there she is.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.218
Fingerprints in the system.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.153
Now the limbo can end

01:59.187 --> 02:01.222
and debt can be collected.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.424
Well, thanks for your help.

Go on with Gator,
he'll get you paid.

Woe unto man,

16:14.907 --> 16:17.244
for he has sinned
in the eyes of the Lord.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.911
And for this wickedness,

16:18.945 --> 16:21.248
he must pay.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.084
[crowd gasping, murmuring]

16:32.559 --> 16:35.062
In forgiveness
of your debts to man,

16:35.095 --> 16:39.166
will you consume
his Lordship's sins to God?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.069
I will.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.271
You may begin.

I give easement and rest
now to thee, dear man.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.648

19:16.923 --> 19:18.591
I like your eye patch.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.859
[stammers]

19:19.892 --> 19:22.329
Actually, that's a,
that's a hunting accident.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.631
Oh, geez. Oh, I stepped
right into that one.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.033
Oh, no, no. I-I-I can see
where the confusion would...

19:27.066 --> 19:28.701
We're looking
for a home defense solution.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.604
Arr, then you came
to the right place.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.005
-Hmm.
-Tell me,

19:33.039 --> 19:35.508
what would you say
is the most critical

19:35.542 --> 19:39.712
in the family conversation,
ease of use or stopping power?

19:39.746 --> 19:42.114
-Stopping power. Definitely.
-Uh, ease of u... Oh.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.250
Yeah.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.118
Can I see
the Benelli M4 Tactical?

19:46.152 --> 19:48.187
Benelli, yeah.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.723
Your missus knows her stuff.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.725
-Ah.
-Oh.

19:52.759 --> 19:56.529
That's a...
How-how much is, uh...?

19:56.563 --> 19:57.964
Oh, $1,300?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.334
[pirate]
It's hard to put
a price on life.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.103
Not-not for you,
apparently, so...

20:04.136 --> 20:05.104
Oh.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.473
Is it 12-gauge? Yeah.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.941
Yeah, yeah,
you could go 12 or 20.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.611
-Uh-huh.
-How about the Heckler 416?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.880
Gas-operated,
short-stroke piston.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.520
Well, 800 rounds per...

20:20.553 --> 20:23.956
-And a handgun.
-And? You want to get
both these?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.525
Maybe the Desert Eagle.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.026
Oh.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.330
[woman] [over P.A.] Trick

Uh...

20:33.099 --> 20:35.868
Get 25% off all gunstocks.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.069
No gun is off the market.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.805
[Dot]
Plus ammunition.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.873
Yeah, sure.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.843
This is $5,000 worth of...

20:43.876 --> 20:46.913
Well, like I said, yeah,
peace of mind is priceless.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.715
Yeah, hon.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.318
-Yeah.
-Is that gonna be
cash or credit?

20:51.351 --> 20:53.219
[Wayne]
Uh...

20:53.252 --> 20:55.221
No credit.
I'll write you a check.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.789
[pirate]
That's music to me ears.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.326
-Yeah.
-[Dot] So, you got cases
for these or...

20:59.359 --> 21:00.927
[pirate]
Yeah, I'll have them all
boxed up for you

21:00.960 --> 21:03.863
and ready to go next week
when you pick up the armaments.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.365
-What do you mean?
-[pirate] Well, of course,

21:05.398 --> 21:06.799
there's the mandatory
waiting period

21:06.833 --> 21:08.134
while we run the check.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.302
Make sure you're not psychopaths

21:09.336 --> 21:12.972
or, you know, socialists.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.774
That last one's a joke.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.109
-No.
-Oh. Yeah.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.911
We need...

21:21.147 --> 21:23.783
Our home is not safe right now.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.585
Yeah, listen, I hear you.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.854
It's this darn federal mandate.

21:27.887 --> 21:31.358
They're taking aim at it
at the state house,

21:31.391 --> 21:33.292
but until they can
shoot it dead, well...

21:33.326 --> 21:34.761
It's only one week.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.866
Yeah.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.972
Let's take a look
at that pepper spray, then.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.974
The what, now?

Hey, Pete.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.588
[Pete]
What part of bed rest
don't you understand?

23:08.621 --> 23:10.690
-[both chuckle]
-All of it, apparently.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.592
I feel just sick
about Iron Mike.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.728
Yeah, he was a fine man,
is what he was.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.632
Say, uh, I'm looking for
anything you took off the D.O.A.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.034
-Donny Ireland.
-Yeah, it's, uh...

23:22.068 --> 23:23.503
You're just in time.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.071
Uh, that other fella's
taking stock right now.

Who, now?

Well, look who it is.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.093
[Witt sighs]

23:47.126 --> 23:48.595
Did you just take something?

23:48.628 --> 23:51.764
You know,
I was on crutches once.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.334
Cornerback tackled me funny
senior year.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.336
It's the armpits, right?
Super painful.

23:57.369 --> 24:01.040
Just now, I, uh...

24:01.073 --> 24:03.710
I saw you put something
in your pocket.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.912
Uh, looked a bit like you,
actually.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.515
Fella who blindsided me.

24:09.616 --> 24:12.184
Black boy,
fat through the middle.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.458
What'd you take?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.895
[clicks tongue]
Now...

24:22.929 --> 24:26.332
son, I've been humoring you
on account of they gave you

24:26.365 --> 24:28.267
the general anesthesia
not too long ago,

24:28.300 --> 24:33.439
and that shit will make the Pope
see spaceships, but...

24:33.472 --> 24:36.242
you accuse me of stealing
one more time,

24:36.275 --> 24:40.079
and I'm gonna do to you what I
did to that boy in high school.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.818
And believe me,

24:45.852 --> 24:47.687
you never want to see
a tire iron

24:47.720 --> 24:50.657
moving that fast
in your direction.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.560
Last chance.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.795
Tell me what you took.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.230
You don't know?

25:03.402 --> 25:05.705
I took your mama out for dinner.

25:07.740 --> 25:12.945
She gave out that ass
like a coupon on coupon day.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.214

25:48.047 --> 25:51.684
-[Pete] You okay, Witt?
-Yeah, yeah. I, um...

25:51.718 --> 25:53.820
Say, did that fella
leave his card?

25:53.853 --> 25:55.087
Yeah.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.124
[grunts]

26:16.175 --> 26:17.710
[laptop chimes]

26:21.313 --> 26:23.115
[Witt]
There you are.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.662
[dialing]

26:35.695 --> 26:37.797
-[line ringing]
-[Danish] Before we dig in,

26:37.830 --> 26:40.767
I want to make clear
this is an informal gathering

26:40.800 --> 26:43.535
with information traveling
uphill from you to us,

26:43.569 --> 26:48.507
not an interview-type situation
where we feel interrogated.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.310
-Well, I do have--
-That's fine.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.746
Deputy.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.848
[sighs] Well, as you know,
we have evidence

26:55.882 --> 26:57.917
of a break-in at your son's
house in Scandia.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.152
To wit, blood residue
and DNA traces

27:00.186 --> 27:01.888
from hair samples
found in the master.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.390
Yeah, my daughter-in-law says
that never happened.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.960
Plus there is a state trooper
in North Dakota

27:07.994 --> 27:11.097
who looks like is going to ID
Mrs. Lyon as present in the car

27:11.130 --> 27:14.000
of two men who opened fire
on his prowler the same night,

27:14.033 --> 27:16.368
with whom he then retreated
to a nearby filling station,

27:16.402 --> 27:17.636
where they were held under siege

27:17.670 --> 27:19.005
until reinforcements
could arrive.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.307
Can't we just make
this whole thing go away?

27:21.340 --> 27:23.575
I mean, really.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.077
Whatever did or didn't happen,

27:25.111 --> 27:27.914
I-I'm sure we can
handle this internally.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.750
[laughs softly]

27:30.783 --> 27:34.987
Mrs. Lyon,
a state trooper is dead.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.655
In North Dakota.

27:36.689 --> 27:40.159
Remind me which state
we're in again.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.962
That's, uh...

27:42.995 --> 27:46.933
We have real evidence
that two extremely violent men

27:46.966 --> 27:50.302
kidnapped your daughter-in-law
for reasons unknown.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.939
-You're not worried
they might come back?
-Which?

27:52.972 --> 27:55.441
The dead one
or the one whose blood

27:55.474 --> 27:58.044
is all over my son's floor?

27:58.077 --> 28:02.614
Seriously,
I can protect my family,

28:02.648 --> 28:05.952
whatever mischief
they may or may not get into.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.987
And if the state trooper IDs
your daughter-in-law

28:08.020 --> 28:09.922
as present for the melee after?

28:09.956 --> 28:13.592
If North Dakota wants
to question either Mrs. Lyon,

28:13.625 --> 28:17.696
Wayne or Dot,
they'll need to go through me.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.633
So we're through.

28:21.667 --> 28:25.004
Yeah. Yep.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.113
What is your function?

28:35.681 --> 28:37.016
Excuse me?

28:37.049 --> 28:40.119
The police.
I mean, why do we need you?

28:40.152 --> 28:45.357
Except as a tool to keep
a certain element in line.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.726
To separate those who have

28:47.760 --> 28:51.197
money, class, intellect

28:51.230 --> 28:54.066
from those who don't.

28:54.100 --> 28:58.670
You're gatekeepers,
standing outside the walls,

28:58.704 --> 29:00.639
keeping the rabble
from getting in.

29:00.672 --> 29:04.977
But in here, inside these walls,

29:05.011 --> 29:07.980
you have no function.

29:08.014 --> 29:11.050
You should remember that.

29:14.486 --> 29:15.621
[Indira clears throat]

29:15.654 --> 29:20.126
So, what do you want to do?

29:20.159 --> 29:23.295
Bring in the security detail
we used last year.

29:23.329 --> 29:26.332
Burl Huffmen's unit
from out in Las Vegas?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.968
Put a team at Wayne's,
and up the security here

29:29.001 --> 29:31.938
-and at my house.
-And what about Dorothy?

29:31.971 --> 29:33.239
You said she showed you

29:33.272 --> 29:35.074
the other side of the coin
yesterday.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.543
She's a wolf in sheep's
clothing, that one.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.711
We keep her close for now.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.713
You said your man
is looking for dirt?

29:41.747 --> 29:43.649
Yeah, former CIA.

29:43.682 --> 29:46.452
Whatever she's hiding,
he'll find it.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.962
[indistinct radio transmission]

29:55.995 --> 29:59.531
[dispatcher]
Car ten, car ten,
what's your 20?

29:59.565 --> 30:02.734
[officer responds indistinctly]

30:02.768 --> 30:04.203
[dispatcher]
Copy that.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.373
We got a 1015 on Elk Street
near Main.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.641
Whenever you're done, if you
could head over and take a look.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.844
