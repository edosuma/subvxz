BARRY
Series 3, Episode 7

01:25.079 --> 01:27.000
Here we go. Guys, you ready?

01:27.079 --> 01:29.159
All right. Roll and music.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.159
Hello. I'm Gene Cousineau,
and I'm a mask collector.

01:41.239 --> 01:44.159
Wait. Isn't this supposed to be
a master class in acting

01:44.239 --> 01:46.719
given by the great performer,
Gene Cousineau?

01:46.799 --> 01:51.239
You're saying to your laptop or
mobile, and yes, it is. Don't fret it.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.799
And by the end of this class,
hopefully,

01:54.120 --> 01:56.959
you're going to be
a mask collector too, god willing.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.439
Let me give you an example
of my favorite masks. Hamlet.

02:00.879 --> 02:03.879
"To be or not to be.
Is that the question?"

02:04.959 --> 02:10.080
Stanley Kowalski. "Stella!
Get down here. I want to eat."

02:10.840 --> 02:16.960
A cop in Serpico. "Hey, Serp,
are you going against us?"

02:17.039 --> 02:23.199
See, these are not literal masks
but roles you'll play in this class,

02:23.280 --> 02:25.240
and they will change your life.

02:25.919 --> 02:31.080
Now, yes, I have given students
the tools to go on to great careers.

02:31.159 --> 02:34.800
This class is not about
entrances and exits.

02:35.199 --> 02:37.439
It is about reaching into your soul,

02:37.520 --> 02:40.439
pulling out that muck,
and throwing it on the stage.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.439
Hey, I'm acting here!

02:43.680 --> 02:48.120
Ratso Rizzo. So, are you ready?
You better be,

02:48.479 --> 02:52.039
'cause the curtain is up,
and the spotlight is on you.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.039
And welcome to Gene Cousineau's
Master Class.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.520
Thank you.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.879
And cut.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.960
Okay, that was good.
I'd like to try one more.

03:08.039 --> 03:10.240
-Resetting.
-No slouching, class.

03:10.319 --> 03:14.479
You're not at home, playing video
games. Lean in and pay attention.

03:14.560 --> 03:19.680
Whoever's on the taxi, try starting
earlier on entrances and exits.

03:19.759 --> 03:22.599
Other than that, very good.
Let's go again.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.680
-Got a laugh on the taxi.
-Yeah, I saw that.

03:53.560 --> 03:54.960
Fuck!

05:16.040 --> 05:18.279
Everybody read the outline on 106?

05:18.920 --> 05:21.360
-How we feel about it?
-So good. You slayed.

05:21.439 --> 05:23.959
-Killer. Awesome.
-Anyone else?

05:24.839 --> 05:26.399
I have a question.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.279
There's that scene where Medusa
Abby hooks up with the bartender,

05:34.360 --> 05:37.360
and the snakes keep falling out
of her hat. That's funny.

05:37.439 --> 05:40.839
That's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be real.

05:42.759 --> 05:47.279
Well, the snakes on her head felt real,
but then she turns him to stone,

05:47.360 --> 05:52.399
but she's still horny, so she sucks
and then eats his dick.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.519
-Is that literal?
-What else would it be?

05:58.439 --> 06:03.399
I was thinking that maybe it could be
more of a conversation.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.639
Like, it could be about her longing,

06:05.720 --> 06:11.160
or like how she can't get close
to people 'cause of the snake thing.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.079
I guess I just... l just want
to know what she's thinking.

06:15.720 --> 06:19.240
She wants to get laid,
and it's funny.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.040
But if she wants to get laid,
why does she bite his dick off?

06:26.439 --> 06:27.759
What?

06:28.439 --> 06:30.480
She does have a point, Mel.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.399
So, just...

06:42.920 --> 06:45.800
-Good job. That was ballsy as fuck.
-Really?

06:45.879 --> 06:49.399
You said everything we've been
thinking but never would've said.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.439
How the fuck is he a showrunner?

06:51.519 --> 06:54.399
He's been around forever. He was
a writer on Everybody Loves Raymond.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.279
-What's that?
-A new show that thinks they're funny.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.800
Apparently, the showrunner's
a fucking party.

07:06.439 --> 07:10.800
... who's also, wait for it...
The love interest.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.399
Okay!

07:20.560 --> 07:25.319
He'll be like, hey, Mel.
My name is Bert, and I love my...

07:27.480 --> 07:29.240
And I'm gonna be like...

07:32.720 --> 07:36.279
Make me an appointment at Chloe
Grace Moretz's acupuncturist.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.439
Make sure it's with the tattoo guy,
not the bangs girl. I did not like her.

07:40.519 --> 07:41.879
Okay.

07:41.959 --> 07:45.480
Ding, ding! I'm hungry.
But not for any of that stuff.

07:57.879 --> 08:00.399
-So you have your own show?
-Yeah.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.319
-What's it about?
-I play a single mom.

08:04.399 --> 08:07.240
I have a cupcake store
with my daughter in Central Park.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.199
-What's it called?
-"Just Desserts".

08:11.439 --> 08:14.959
-So you stole my show?
-No, it's an important story to me.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.240
It's not a story.
It's a fucking math equation.

08:19.319 --> 08:20.800
I'm feeling uncomfortable.

08:20.879 --> 08:24.079
You have nothing to say
about anything.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.040
You've never struggled a day
in your whole fucking life!

08:27.120 --> 08:30.800
Nobody's ever put a hand around
your neck! This was my story.

08:30.879 --> 08:35.559
My story! You don't even have
a fucking daughter!

08:35.639 --> 08:37.320
Neither do you, Sally.

08:37.879 --> 08:42.960
You are nothing without me.
Nobody, stupid piece of shit.

08:43.039 --> 08:46.399
I brought you into the fold,
and this is how you betray me!

08:46.480 --> 08:49.519
-I peeled your carrots for you.
-You entitled cunt!

08:49.960 --> 08:52.360
You entitled fucking cunt!

08:52.440 --> 08:55.080
You entitled fucking cunt!

08:56.919 --> 08:59.279
You entitled fucking cunt!

09:18.039 --> 09:19.600
Cristobal Sifuentes?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.720
Cristobal Sifuentes?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.399
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

09:37.399 --> 09:38.639
No.

09:39.759 --> 09:42.879
Do you know where
the Sifuentes family lives?

09:43.720 --> 09:45.200
They drugs.

09:45.639 --> 09:47.679
Yes, they do deal drugs.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.600
Do you know where maybe?

09:50.679 --> 09:54.279
A house or apartment building.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.159
Maybe a cross street perhaps?

10:13.159 --> 10:16.960
That's what I thought you were doing,
but did not want to be rude. So...

11:38.480 --> 11:40.919
No, don't laugh.
Keep it going, kids.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.720
-Now, how do you feel?
-Like a ghost.

11:44.799 --> 11:46.759
-Wrong. How do you feel?
-Embarrassed.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.639
She's right.
Okay, now do the scene.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.279
Doctor, the generators are down.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.320
If we don't get electricity back
in the park, the dinosaurs will escape.

11:57.399 --> 12:00.320
-Let's split up.
-Stop. You see the difference?

12:00.399 --> 12:02.759
It is all in the body.
It's much more real.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.879
I believe she's got the code.
He'll ride the dinosaur. It'll be fine.

12:06.960 --> 12:12.080
Embrace your embarrassment.
I want a purple lollipop!

12:12.879 --> 12:15.200
Do I look like a fool?
Not my problem.

12:15.279 --> 12:18.120
That was good. I don't think we need
to switch out those students.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.159
So, how was that, boss?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.440
Yeah, fine.

12:27.159 --> 12:29.639
So, you want me to mark
the first or second take?

12:31.320 --> 12:35.960
I haven't done this in twenty years.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

12:36.039 --> 12:39.879
-Do you need a minute?
-I don't want him to know.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.759
Okay. I won't tell him.

12:42.679 --> 12:46.679
Dude, I'm having a full-on
fucking panic attack.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.240
Don't panic. It looks really good.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.480
-It does?
-Yeah, you're doing great.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.399
What was your name again?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.320
Cheryl.

12:58.679 --> 13:01.840
Cheryl scripty.
Thanks, Cheryl.

13:04.279 --> 13:06.679
-Mark take two.
-Okay.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.279
Jim Moss?

13:21.279 --> 13:22.759
Ken Goulet.

13:23.399 --> 13:25.240
Mind if we go for a drive?

13:25.679 --> 13:29.120
I don't know what happened,
but the cops just let him go,

13:29.200 --> 13:33.120
so here's my card.
Address is on the back.

13:36.279 --> 13:38.759
You know this how?
He told you?

13:38.840 --> 13:42.720
Nah. Got my ways of finding out.
A couple of tours in country.

13:43.159 --> 13:45.000
You learn some things.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.399
-I was in 'Nam. Fighter pilot.
-No shit.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.279
Yeah. Got shot down.
Captured.

13:52.799 --> 13:56.039
Candy asses.
They make you talk?

13:56.120 --> 13:59.919
I got in my interrogator's head,
and he ended up committing suicide.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.960
Some of the other guys escaped.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.679
You convinced your interrogator
to kill himself?

14:07.759 --> 14:12.080
Yeah. Some of the other guys said
I had an aptitude for it.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.000
I thought they were just being nice.
But when I got to S.E.R.E. school,

14:16.080 --> 14:18.600
they pulled me out of class
and made me an instructor.

14:18.679 --> 14:22.960
And the guy killed himself?
Was he depressed?

14:23.039 --> 14:26.399
I wanted my daughter Janice
to get into it, but she resisted.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.480
She said, "Daddy,
what you do is fucked up."

14:30.559 --> 14:33.200
Did you get any sense
of his home life?

14:33.279 --> 14:36.600
Then she went and did her homicide
thing. I was proud of her.

14:38.240 --> 14:43.159
I mean, he worked in a prison camp
in the jungle during Vietnam.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.720
Seems like might've been
a ticking clock.

14:46.639 --> 14:49.159
I'm not saying anything against you.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.279
It might be a right man,
right day situation.

14:52.720 --> 14:57.440
For instance, I got a super touchy
cousin. One day at breakfast, I said,

14:57.519 --> 15:00.480
"Don, you don't know how to make
a proper short stack."

15:00.559 --> 15:03.799
He put down his spatula, went
out back, and he hung himself.

15:04.399 --> 15:11.159
I'm no kind of genius, but just
a simple tonnage... issue.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.080
Shit.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.879
That's him.
One hundred percent.

15:23.200 --> 15:28.519
Okay. Mr. Moss,
he kills your daughter,

15:28.600 --> 15:31.000
and then he shows up
at your door. Why?

15:32.120 --> 15:34.799
He was claiming Janice's killer
was still out there.

15:35.279 --> 15:38.960
Said it was a student in Gene
Cousineau's class, Barry Berkman.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.480
Fed me some line
about how I could get justice.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.600
Gentlemen, respectfully,

15:45.679 --> 15:49.519
this is the Raven,
and he's crafty like a fox.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.360
If he gets Jim here to kill Berkman,
it throws suspicion away from him.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.720
We're not falling for that.

15:54.799 --> 15:58.519
No matter how many people tell us
it was Berkman, we know it was him.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.840
-Who else said it was Berkman?
-Cousineau.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.519
This is what I'm talking about.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.279
This Raven guy knew Cousineau
was convinced it was Barry,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.480
and he's trying
to keep that lie going.

16:08.639 --> 16:10.279
He's an evil genius.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.759
I want to talk to Fuches alone.
No cameras.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.919
-That's not how we do things.
-Mae!

16:15.000 --> 16:17.919
This is the FBI, okay?
They're pros.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.240
Want a Phonebook to hit him with?
Sock full of coins?

17:44.839 --> 17:47.440
Hello? Hello?

17:48.720 --> 17:50.039
Hank?

17:52.599 --> 17:54.039
Akhmal?

17:56.319 --> 17:57.839
Hank!

17:58.920 --> 18:00.440
Are you okay?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.160
Are they torturing you?

18:04.920 --> 18:09.039
Yes. They want to know
about you and Cristobal.

18:10.079 --> 18:11.960
And how Fernando was killed.

18:15.079 --> 18:16.680
Where are we?

18:16.759 --> 18:22.319
We don't know. There are
about four men and Elena.

18:24.119 --> 18:28.400
Hank.
I'm almost out of my handcuffs.

18:30.319 --> 18:35.160
-I have one loose.
-He's bleeding very bad, Hank.

18:38.839 --> 18:40.279
What can I do?

18:41.839 --> 18:47.599
When I get loose,
I'll free Akhmal. Be ready.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.440
Okay.

19:05.599 --> 19:08.039
-Hey, Lindsay.
-We have a problem.

19:08.119 --> 19:10.400
-What now?
-I just sent it to you.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.160
-... this is how you betrayed me.
-I peeled your carrots for you.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.759
Oh my god.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.720
You entitled fucking cunt!

19:25.799 --> 19:27.440
She was recording you.

19:29.319 --> 19:31.839
Medusa sent it to me.
They're dropping you.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.559
They don't think someone who talks
like this belongs in their room.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.440
-l have to post an apology.
-No, you don't.

19:40.559 --> 19:42.960
Listen, I'm coming over, okay?

19:45.359 --> 19:47.279
That was perfect, Gene.

19:47.359 --> 19:49.480
-Really?
-It was unbelievable.

19:49.559 --> 19:55.400
I loved how engaged the class was.
I loved your warmth on stage.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.519
Now I can tell
teaching gives you joy.

19:58.599 --> 20:01.119
You know, it does.
But what about Annie?

20:01.839 --> 20:05.680
-Where are you from?
-New York by way of Minnesota.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.880
You're a talent.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.680
The way you photographed Gene,
you made him so, uh...

20:14.440 --> 20:15.799
-Masculine?
-No.

20:17.119 --> 20:18.279
-Virile?
-No.

20:18.359 --> 20:20.559
-Rugged? Brawny? Gallant?
-Nope.

20:20.640 --> 20:24.359
Robust? Lantern-jawed?
"Un homme pour toutes saisons."

20:24.440 --> 20:26.920
No, no. Tall.

20:27.839 --> 20:32.720
Absolutely, he was like a real giant.
He was very Adonis-like.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.640
-Actually, it was all due to Annie.
-Yeah.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.200
I've got some other projects
I'd love to talk to you about.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.839
-Who's your agent?
-I haven't had one since 1982.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.720
-I could be of help to you there.
-Doesn't matter.

20:46.799 --> 20:49.920
Want to get you in a room.
Very impressed.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.039
You should be. You don't know
what's coming down the pike.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.480
-She's incredible.
-Absolutely marvelous.

20:55.559 --> 20:57.599
I think she did great.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.359
Jim, what're you doing here?

21:04.359 --> 21:08.240
The man who took you out
to Janice's body contacted me.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.279
Why?

21:13.880 --> 21:18.559
He said he was some investigator.
He's in jail now.

21:20.519 --> 21:21.759
How?

21:22.799 --> 21:24.319
I took him there.

21:28.160 --> 21:32.319
So, he's talking to the police now.
What do you think he's saying?

21:33.119 --> 21:35.559
He said your student Barry
killed Janice.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.920
Barry's a good kid.
That's not him.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.559
I mean, he was in war,
and he's all like a mixed up dummy,

21:48.920 --> 21:52.359
but he's a good egg.
He was with us at the cabin.

21:52.799 --> 21:55.720
Now I wish he was armed.
Maybe he could've killed

21:55.799 --> 21:59.400
those guys that took Janice,
those Russians.

21:59.480 --> 22:03.000
But no, it's not him.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.000
Congratulations on your show.

22:11.559 --> 22:16.000
I would like to sincerely apologize
for my perceived transgression

22:16.079 --> 22:21.559
against my former employee. Friend
and employee, Natalie Greer.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.680
Even though the word in question
was traditionally used

22:24.759 --> 22:28.079
as a form of kinship between women
and is widely used in Europe,

22:28.160 --> 22:29.680
I understand I have offended...

22:29.759 --> 22:31.119
It's the truth.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.799
... and for that I am deeply sorry.
But I just want to say,

22:33.880 --> 22:35.480
be careful who you trust.

22:35.559 --> 22:40.680
Because it takes a certain type
of person to record a private...

22:40.759 --> 22:43.519
This isn't an apology.
This is damage control.

22:43.599 --> 22:45.119
It's the fucking truth.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.279
It has nothing to do
with what happened with Natalie,

22:47.359 --> 22:49.559
and it cheapens what you set out
to do with your show.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.279
My show is me, Lindsay,
and she stole my fucking show.

22:54.359 --> 22:59.720
If you had just let me deal with it...
Why did you have to say something?

22:59.799 --> 23:01.319
Fuck off!

23:01.400 --> 23:04.759
You don't care about me.
You don't care about Joplin.

23:04.839 --> 23:06.839
You just care about your commission.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.359
Oh, it's so important to have
a great relationship with BanShe.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.880
You want the relationship
with BanShe, not me.

23:11.960 --> 23:16.400
You work for me,
and I am fucking drowning,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.519
and instead of trying to help me,
you're just trying to save yourself.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.480
This is honest, okay? This is
the honest fucking truth.

23:22.559 --> 23:26.799
If that makes me unhireable, so be it.
But at least I told the fucking truth.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.680
I have to drop you.

23:36.079 --> 23:39.200
Good, 'cause I don't want
to work with liars.

23:46.039 --> 23:47.440
Okay.

24:07.319 --> 24:10.759
You know the sound of kids' footsteps
early in the morning?

24:12.599 --> 24:14.160
I still hear it.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.559
I can hear him in his room
on his computer.

24:19.400 --> 24:24.119
I'll talk to him from my office
across the hall. Full conversations.

24:27.279 --> 24:31.160
My wife says I'm losing my mind.

24:31.240 --> 24:35.559
She thinks this city turned him
into some devil.

24:36.799 --> 24:40.000
I never wanted to hurt anyone
my whole life,

24:42.240 --> 24:47.440
until we had Ryan.
The love I had for that child!

24:48.400 --> 24:50.480
It terrified me. I mean,

24:51.480 --> 24:54.160
what would I do
if something happened to him?

24:57.440 --> 25:00.200
And then I found out
what you did, and...

25:04.119 --> 25:05.519
I can't.

25:08.559 --> 25:12.319
I could leave you here, and you'll rot.

25:17.119 --> 25:18.559
But I can't.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.640
Why?

25:25.680 --> 25:26.920
Why?

25:30.240 --> 25:32.240
I want to see my son again.

26:54.720 --> 26:59.599
White male, late sixties,
self-inflicted possible DOA.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.599
Hi.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.720
Listen, I'm going to be straight
with you.

27:33.960 --> 27:38.440
You tell me what you know,
you cooperate, I help you.

27:38.519 --> 27:40.240
I told you what I know.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.480
Why'd you go see Jim Moss?

27:43.839 --> 27:47.119
To give him information
about who killed his daughter.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.720
Who's that?

27:49.480 --> 27:51.519
-Ask him.
-I'm asking you.

27:56.359 --> 27:58.880
By the way, those cameras are off.

28:00.319 --> 28:03.319
-Why?
-Because I asked them to be.

28:05.119 --> 28:06.839
Know how I got this?

28:07.240 --> 28:10.000
-Shaving?
-No, that's a bad joke.

28:10.319 --> 28:15.440
No, I got this while I served
in Afghanistan.

28:17.680 --> 28:22.519
We were on a patrol,
and I got hit by a sniper.

28:23.599 --> 28:29.559
And my buddy wanted payback,
but he took it out on the wrong guy.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.119
And then he got discharged.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.720
You're Albert.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.880
I am.

28:40.799 --> 28:42.400
Oh my God.

28:43.519 --> 28:45.240
How do you know Berkman?

28:46.160 --> 28:51.160
-I'm... his manager.
-His manager?

28:51.680 --> 28:53.799
Like, for his acting stuff?

28:56.240 --> 28:58.920
I'm trying to help you here.
Be straight with me.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.400
-No...
-Is Barry caught up in all this shit?

29:10.319 --> 29:14.039
-You served with a guy named Chris.
-Yes.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.599
Yeah.
Too bad what happened to him.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.119
His wife and kids, how sad.

29:22.440 --> 29:28.240
Little Theo still sleeps with his mom
because he's afraid

29:28.319 --> 29:32.359
whoever killed his daddy
was gonna get him.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.079
Kid's got intuition.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.000
You ever wonder why Chris,
who never saw combat,

29:40.079 --> 29:44.559
was basically a computer geek,
would even have PTSD?

29:45.759 --> 29:49.680
Now, he loved Sharon and Theo.
They were his whole world.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.319
Why would he take himself out,

29:52.400 --> 29:56.000
knowing that something like that
would fuck them up for life?

29:57.240 --> 30:03.920
Well, that... switch you saw go off
when Barry was avenging you,

30:05.839 --> 30:09.599
I harnessed that into
a very lucrative job for him.

30:12.640 --> 30:17.839
One day, sent Barry out on a mission,
went sideways,

30:18.400 --> 30:23.000
and Chris, he was at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

30:23.759 --> 30:25.960
Saw some shit he shouldn't have.

30:31.119 --> 30:34.440
You know Barry still participates
in those charity runs

30:34.519 --> 30:36.759
that Sharon does
in Chris's memory?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.920
Barry's a good guy.

30:44.599 --> 30:45.759
What did he say?

30:45.839 --> 30:48.680
You can question him if you want,
I'm leaving.

31:04.319 --> 31:07.440
