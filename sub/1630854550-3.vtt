WEBVTT

00:21.640 --> 00:24.440
CHATTER IN GERMAN

00:24.480 --> 00:27.520
Und was ist das da?

00:27.560 --> 00:30.000
CHILDREN GIGGLING

00:30.000 --> 00:30.040
CHILDREN GIGGLING

00:44.200 --> 00:49.080
CHATTER, LAUGHTER

01:17.080 --> 01:19.080
CHILDREN GIGGLE

01:44.160 --> 01:47.360
If you do confess
and confess in full,

01:47.400 --> 01:52.360
every secret you ever passed,
every death you caused...

01:52.400 --> 01:56.160
If you do that, then you'll be
allowed to return home

01:56.200 --> 01:58.600
to live out your days
in peace and anonymity.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.000
Nice country cottage, village
cricket team, friendly local pub...

02:00.000 --> 02:04.120
Nice country cottage, village
cricket team, friendly local pub...

02:05.880 --> 02:08.320
..where no-one,
not even your family,

02:08.360 --> 02:11.440
and especially not your children,
will ever have the slightest idea

02:11.480 --> 02:13.560
of the things you've done.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.160
However, anything less than
a full confession

02:17.200 --> 02:20.240
and you will be tried for treason,

02:20.280 --> 02:22.560
where they will scream
for your blood until they get it

02:22.600 --> 02:24.560
because, as I am sure you are aware,

02:24.600 --> 02:27.960
by far your biggest sin
was to make a mockery of them.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.440
We're having some friends
for dinner tomorrow night.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.720
You remember Dick Beeston
from The Times,

02:36.760 --> 02:39.720
and Miles Copeland from the CIA?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.120
This isn't a fucking game, Kim.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.200
Now that you've come all this way,

02:43.240 --> 02:45.560
Eleanor would be most upset
not to see you.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.400
To say that patience in London
is wearing thin

02:48.440 --> 02:50.760
would be a huge understatement.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.240
Put it this way -

02:53.280 --> 02:55.200
if you don't come,

02:55.240 --> 02:58.000
eyebrows will be raised

02:58.040 --> 03:00.000
and questions will be asked.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.440
and questions will be asked.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.600
Unless of course London's already
briefed Washington about all this.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.520
For the last time,
the Americans know nothing.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.560
Well, then.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.120
And no-one even knows I'm here.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.000
Don't be absurd, this is Beirut.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.960
You've got 24 more hours.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.360
After that, my hands are tied.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.680
That's settled, then.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.720
Seven-thirty for eight.
Bring that appetite of yours.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.840
Arise, shine,
for thy light has come.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.960
And the glory of the Lord
is risen upon thee.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.480
HE SCOFFS

04:32.360 --> 04:35.320
It appears the Americans
are now involved.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.800
Yesterday afternoon in Ohio,
this man,

04:39.840 --> 04:42.280
Michael Whitney Straight,

04:42.320 --> 04:44.880
date of birth, 09/01/16,

04:44.920 --> 04:50.920
he appeared of his own free will at
the FBI field office in Cincinnati

04:50.960 --> 04:54.520
to confess that he was recruited
by the Russian Intelligence Service

04:54.560 --> 05:00.000
some time in the '30s,
whilst at Cambridge with...

05:00.000 --> 05:00.120
some time in the '30s,
whilst at Cambridge with...

05:02.760 --> 05:06.840
Subject claims all contact
with RIS terminated November 1945.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.320
As far as we know, he's yet to
give them any further information.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.840
Maybe he has something to trade.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.400
Moments after he turned himself in,

05:16.440 --> 05:20.600
this Telex, alerting the US Embassy
in London,

05:20.640 --> 05:23.840
was delivered to
a basement flat in Westminster,

05:23.880 --> 05:26.040
which happens to be
just around the corner from...

05:26.080 --> 05:27.960
From Nicholas Elliott's house.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.320
Very good.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.520
Interesting that this man decides
to turn himself in to the FBI

05:34.560 --> 05:37.320
right now, of all times.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.280
He obviously got wind
of Philby's defection.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.000
Most likely
from the very same people

05:41.040 --> 05:43.280
he claims to have terminated
all contact with in '45.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.920
Either way,
the Americans are on to Elliott.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.120
They know Philby gave him something
in Beirut

05:48.160 --> 05:51.480
and we have to find out what that is
before they do.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.840
Mark my words,
Nicholas Elliott is up to something.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.800
MUSIC PLAYS

06:41.320 --> 06:45.600
THEY SPEAK IN OWN LANGUAGE

07:00.480 --> 07:02.680
Are you going to buy us a drink?

07:09.640 --> 07:11.520
Where are you taking us?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.600
THEY TALK IN OWN LANGUAGE

07:17.360 --> 07:18.920
WOMEN SQUEAL

07:32.440 --> 07:34.640
GUNSHOT,
SCREAMING

08:04.560 --> 08:05.920
Everything all right, Erich?

08:05.960 --> 08:08.160
We need to go - now!

08:10.120 --> 08:11.600
Erich!

08:15.800 --> 08:17.880
Hello.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.240
Anyone home?

08:21.280 --> 08:25.440
Where were you - Beirut again?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.040
Istanbul.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.920
'During the war.'

08:36.840 --> 08:37.920
Back in the days

08:37.960 --> 08:40.920
when I was considered rather good
at this kind of thing.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.960
Go! Go.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.760
Let's go.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.920
Elizabeth. Darling?
Careful, don't flood it.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.960
Wait!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.240
Start the car! Drive!

09:12.280 --> 09:15.920
They will kill everyone. The Gestapo
will round everyone up...

09:15.960 --> 09:17.320
What are you doing? Start the car.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.080
As far as they know,
you've been kidnapped.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.560
We don't have time for this.
We've been over this, Erich,

09:21.600 --> 09:23.440
there is no chance...

09:23.480 --> 09:27.120
I'm risking the lives of everyone
I know, my family, my friends...

09:27.160 --> 09:29.240
The only way they'll find out
that you've defected

09:29.280 --> 09:30.000
is if one of us here in this car
gets caught and talks.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.840
is if one of us here in this car
gets caught and talks.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.400
We have to go. Come on!

10:27.120 --> 10:29.120
That horse-faced woman
you play bridge with

10:29.160 --> 10:30.000
who works at Buckingham Palace?

10:30.000 --> 10:30.480
who works at Buckingham Palace?

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
Suzie?
Hm.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.240
She doesn't have a horse face.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.600
You're the one who said...

10:37.800 --> 10:39.880
Never mind.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.680
Do you think she might be able
to get us on the guest list

10:42.720 --> 10:45.040
for a private view at the
Queen's Gallery this afternoon?

10:45.080 --> 10:46.720
This afternoon?
Hm.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.480
Cutting it a bit close, aren't you?

10:49.520 --> 10:51.680
A private view?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.960
You detest that kind of thing.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.680
Art? I think I take umbrage at that.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.720
What's going on?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.720
What are you up to?

11:11.720 --> 11:13.400
'Any more toast?'

11:32.080 --> 11:33.760
KNOCK ON DOOR

11:40.880 --> 11:44.640
SPEAKS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE

11:47.720 --> 11:49.440
A gift from Mother Russia.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.520
Try it.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.920
I'm not very hungry.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.000
The coat.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.440
The coat.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.760
Ah.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.120
Lovely. Thank you.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.080
Today you become a real Russian.

12:26.760 --> 12:30.000
'Speaking of Americans,
what have they been told?

12:30.000 --> 12:30.880
'Speaking of Americans,
what have they been told?

12:30.920 --> 12:35.240
'Nothing. Yet. Which is why
the sooner you tell me everything,

12:35.280 --> 12:37.960
'the sooner we can take care
of them,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.360
'and any others
that might be out there.'

12:42.120 --> 12:44.600
Your septic. In the basement.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.320
Do you think it would be possible
to rustle up some marmalade?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.320
You don't like kasha?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.080
I imagine it could be sent
from London

13:40.120 --> 13:41.480
in the diplomatic pouch.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.120
Or is it Comrade Galina
you don't like?

13:46.880 --> 13:50.240
And some decent tobacco and The
Times crosswords wouldn't go amiss.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.000
It's the little things.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.440
For what it's worth, I don't think
you could cope with a trial,

14:37.480 --> 14:39.960
much less with everything
the press will throw at you.

14:42.120 --> 14:46.000
Frankly, I would never want it to
come to that

14:46.040 --> 14:47.920
because all I care about now,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.800
and you know me well enough
to know this is true,

14:50.840 --> 14:51.000
is salvaging something useful
out of this mess.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.080
is salvaging something useful
out of this mess.

14:55.120 --> 15:00.440
First the stick and then the carrot.
I taught you that.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.200
You may well have managed to
convince yourself

15:06.240 --> 15:10.200
that you betrayed your country,
your friends, your family,

15:10.240 --> 15:13.960
in the service of a principle -

15:14.000 --> 15:17.440
a core belief in a greater good,

15:17.480 --> 15:21.000
or some such rubbish,
but deep down, Kim,

15:21.000 --> 15:21.360
or some such rubbish,
but deep down, Kim,

15:21.400 --> 15:26.120
deep down,
I know you know you're wrong.

15:26.160 --> 15:30.440
I can see it, as I look at
you now - wrong, immoral,

15:30.480 --> 15:33.160
politically naive, delusional.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.200
Don't turn your back on me!

15:36.920 --> 15:40.800
As a matter of interest, have you
ever given a moment's thought

15:40.840 --> 15:45.080
to all the people that have
been killed because of you?

15:45.120 --> 15:46.720
Comrade Philby.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.840
' "A Master of Men
was the Goodly Fere,

16:12.880 --> 16:15.040
' "a mate of the wind and sea." '

16:15.080 --> 16:16.760
Come again?

16:16.800 --> 16:21.000
"If they think they ha' slain
our Goodly Fere,

16:21.000 --> 16:21.120
"If they think they ha' slain
our Goodly Fere,

16:21.160 --> 16:25.160
"they are fools eternally."

16:25.200 --> 16:27.280
It's about Jesus on the cross.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.680
'You're drunk.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.880
'Yes, indeed.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.520
'Do you even believe in God?'

16:36.920 --> 16:38.640
Do you mean to tell me...

16:40.680 --> 16:42.840
Are you...

16:42.880 --> 16:47.160
Are you seriously suggesting there's
a similarity between you and...

16:47.200 --> 16:48.560
Well...

16:48.600 --> 16:50.960
THEY LAUGH

16:51.000 --> 16:55.960
'Oh, that takes the fucking biscuit.
It really does!'

16:57.320 --> 17:01.640
Ah. It's moments like this
I joined the service for.

17:01.680 --> 17:06.680
The belly laughs!
Oh, the belly laughs.

17:06.720 --> 17:11.520
'Bloody marvellous, Kim.
You and Jesus!'

17:22.320 --> 17:25.000
' "..wind and sea..." '
Come again?

Goodly Fere,

' "they are fools eternally." '

17:52.280 --> 17:56.280
You understand, Mr Straight, that
we need a whole lot more than just

17:56.320 --> 18:02.160
a simple mea culpa. We need
the names of your... comrades.

18:06.080 --> 18:11.120
This one, you don't get points for.
We already know about Philby.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.960
And Burgess.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.600
And Maclean.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.200
Take your time, sir.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.000
CHATTERING

18:53.360 --> 18:56.120
Didn't know you were
an art lover, Elliott.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.240
Aren't we all?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.040
No Elizabeth?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.240
Fashionably late, as usual.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.760
Sausage on a stick?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.960
It's a frightful cock-up,
this Philby business.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.720
Do you know, I had no idea
until somebody told me the other day

19:12.760 --> 19:14.520
that you two were so close.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.320
Nick, my dear fellow,
how good of you to come.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.360
Hello, Tony.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.880
Don't be a cunt, Jack,
there's a good chap.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.280
Little bird tells me we may all be
having a jolly good laugh

19:26.320 --> 19:28.600
at your expense
in the not too distant future.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.160
Everything all right?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.240
Well, you know.
Profumo being Profumo.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.560
Oh!

19:37.560 --> 19:39.800
I just wanted to let you know

19:39.840 --> 19:42.440
how dreadfully sorry I am
about everything.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.560
Life goes on.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.680
What do you think?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.320
I was rather hoping you'd tell me.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.000
Ah, they're my cue.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.960
Ah, they're my cue.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.320
Kim had us all fooled, you know.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.920
Not just you.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.560
Thanks, Tony.
Very kind of you to say so.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.480
And I hope you don't mind me
pulling strings to come to this.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.560
No, not a bit, not a bit.
Delighted to see you.

20:15.720 --> 20:19.520
Your Majesty, allow me to introduce
you to Sir Roger Hollis,

20:19.560 --> 20:21.000
Director General of MI5.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.280

22:20.720 --> 22:21.000
CHATTER

22:21.000 --> 22:22.680
CHATTER

22:25.200 --> 22:27.560
BLEATING

22:27.600 --> 22:29.320
HE SIGHS

22:33.240 --> 22:34.880
Good kip?

23:00.440 --> 23:02.040
This is your house?

23:02.080 --> 23:03.640
My parents'.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.000
A romantic notion of my father's.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.920
It's just that little bit too far
from London

23:07.960 --> 23:09.640
and the ballet for my mother.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.120
Oh, that's odd, where's the key?

23:14.160 --> 23:16.920
Ah. Dr Watson,
not a moment too soon.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.560
What are you doing here?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.160
Hello.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.000
Kim Philby.

23:21.000 --> 23:21.800
Kim Philby.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.160
You must be Herr Vermehren.
Well done, you.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.160
It's all right. He's one of us.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.680
C's orders. There's a war on, you
know. Walls have ears and all that.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.680
Kettle's on.
Hope you like squashed flies.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.720
Squashed flies?

23:35.760 --> 23:38.520
An English biscuit that might make
you wish you were still a Nazi.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.480
I was never a Nazi.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.440
Wish I could paint.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.880
How did you get in here?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.680
Tradesman's entrance.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.400
Why are you here?

24:01.800 --> 24:04.560
Is that the Secretary of War
with Prince Philip?

24:05.680 --> 24:07.880
Act like we're talking about him.

24:07.920 --> 24:08.960
Why?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.280
For fun.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.560
Blah de blah de blah...

24:13.600 --> 24:15.240
SHE LAUGHS

24:15.280 --> 24:17.920
That's very good.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.000
I have a question
about James Jesus Angleton.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.920
I have a question
about James Jesus Angleton.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.240
I think he dropped the Jesus.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.680
He a friend of yours?

24:28.720 --> 24:31.320
He was always much more
a friend of Kim's than mine.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.800
Gonna need it in writing, gentlemen.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.880
We don't do that.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.000
My client's told you
he's prepared to name names...

24:51.000 --> 24:52.200
My client's told you
he's prepared to name names...

24:52.240 --> 24:53.520
Name. Singular.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.440
I have only one name.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.720
Total immunity, in writing.
Call J Edgar himself if you have to.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.520
And so we're clear,

25:02.560 --> 25:06.400
the name I have isn't in any of
the photographs you've shown me.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.880
Darling?

25:18.920 --> 25:21.000
This is Mrs Thomas
I was telling you about.

25:21.000 --> 25:21.440
This is Mrs Thomas
I was telling you about.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.120
Right. Yes, of course. Hello.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.640
And may I introduce
Sir Anthony Blunt,

25:26.680 --> 25:28.320
Purveyor of the Queen's Pictures?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.800
Surveyor.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.200
What?
Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.040
What did I say?
Purveyor.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.560
Mrs Thomas is from Newcastle.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.200
Durham.
She's one of your old mob.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.600
MI5?
Mm-hm.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.960
Counter-intelligence, no less.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
How do you do, Sir Anthony?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.000
We're a dying breed, old boy.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.520
We're a dying breed, old boy.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.240
We were hoping
you might have a few moments

25:57.280 --> 25:59.760
to tell us about the new Vermehren.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.360
What?

26:02.400 --> 26:04.240
The Vermeer.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.360
You said... Vermehren.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.560
Vermeer.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.680
I meant Vermeer.

26:10.720 --> 26:16.640
Well, er, Vermeer...
as I'm sure I don't need to...

26:16.680 --> 26:18.840
is such an important artist

26:18.880 --> 26:21.000
and this particular painting
that in actual fact belongs to...

26:21.000 --> 26:23.640
and this particular painting
that in actual fact belongs to...

26:23.680 --> 26:26.800
I... I'm so sorry,
will you please forgive me?

26:26.840 --> 26:28.320
Heavens, don't worry about us.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.360
Duty calls.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.160
Who's Vermehren?

26:32.200 --> 26:34.080
He meant Vermeer.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.800
Well, I think that's quite enough
culture for one day, don't you?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.320
Lovely to finally meet you.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.680
You, too.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.440
Lovely.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.240
Are you all right?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.680
Come on.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.480
For you.

27:51.760 --> 27:57.720
Order of The Red Banner...
for services to the Soviet people.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.080
Lovely, thank you.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.640
Thank you.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.680
It's a step up from that frightful
diesel they serve at the palace.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.800
What does Erich Vermehren
have to do with Tony Blunt?

28:53.840 --> 28:57.960
What lovely weather we're having!
Don't be an arse, darling.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.040
It was a slip of the tongue.
Nothing more.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.600
You wanted to go to that thing
tonight

29:01.640 --> 29:04.040
just so you could drop
Vermehren's name to Tony.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.600
All right. Don't you dare try to
deny it, not to me.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.680
Look...
And don't do that, either.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.760
I'm not some fucking secretary
chasing office gossip.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.560
And all I wanted was
a nice quiet supper with my wife.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.960
Bit on the elaborate side,
don't you think?

29:22.200 --> 29:23.520
What?

29:23.560 --> 29:25.240
Mistaking Vermehren for Vermeer.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.120
Shall we talk about something else?

29:29.160 --> 29:33.240
Kim told you something, didn't he?
In Beirut.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.040
Darling...
Something about Tony Blunt.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.120
Which one is penne?
And you wanted to test if it was...

29:42.240 --> 29:45.080
You almost gave Tony a heart attack.

29:45.120 --> 29:48.760
It's true, isn't it,
whatever Kim told you?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.880
If it isn't, I'm a goner.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.400
Penne's the little tubey ones.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.920
Everything hangs on
what Blunt does next.

30:09.640 --> 30:13.360
Yes, that was the whole purpose
of the exercise today.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.800
Elaborate but effective.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.000
So thank you, darling, as always,

30:18.040 --> 30:20.000
for your help, but could we now
please change the subject?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
for your help, but could we now
please change the subject?

30:29.240 --> 30:31.520
This Mrs Thomas person...

30:34.320 --> 30:36.520
..friend or foe?

30:36.560 --> 30:41.040
Not sure yet. Definitely
some promise there, though.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.400
You used to say that about me.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.320
I know. But that was
just to get in your knickers.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.080
You beast!
I dare you!

30:49.040 --> 30:50.000
GIGGLING

30:50.000 --> 30:51.200
GIGGLING

31:06.640 --> 31:08.600
Silly arse!

31:14.200 --> 31:16.640
Ogon' yest'? Ogon'.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.000
Ogon', ogon' yest'?

31:20.000 --> 31:20.240
Ogon', ogon' yest'?

31:24.080 --> 31:25.080
I sigaret?

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
Huh?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.560
Spasibo.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.760
So, he says to her...

32:02.360 --> 32:05.120
.."My name is Dr Brown

32:05.160 --> 32:09.840
"and the other day
I went on the train to Exeter

32:09.880 --> 32:13.880
"where I had scones
and strawberry jam for tea.

32:13.920 --> 32:17.440
"And on the way, the train
stopped just outside Taunton

32:17.480 --> 32:20.000
"where I saw a lovely rainbow over
a field of black and white cows."

32:20.000 --> 32:21.760
"where I saw a lovely rainbow over
a field of black and white cows."

32:21.800 --> 32:26.480
And then he checks her eyes and ears
and reflexes and so on,

32:26.520 --> 32:30.160
and after he had finished
with all that he asked her,

32:30.200 --> 32:34.440
"Where did I travel to on
the train?" And Mother says...

32:35.880 --> 32:37.960
Exeter.
..Exeter.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.720
Very good.
"And what did I have for tea?"

32:42.760 --> 32:44.560
And Mother says...

32:46.360 --> 32:48.480
Scones and strawberry jam.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.000
"Excellent! Excellent!"
says the doctor,

32:50.000 --> 32:50.920
"Excellent! Excellent!"
says the doctor,

32:50.960 --> 32:54.240
and then he asks her,
"What's my name again?"

32:55.520 --> 32:58.240
And Mother thinks to herself
and she says,

32:58.280 --> 33:01.920
"Er, Johnson, Dr Johnson."

33:03.680 --> 33:06.200
And the doctor pauses
and he tells her,

33:06.240 --> 33:10.760
"No. No, Brown, Dr Brown."

33:10.800 --> 33:15.840
To which Mother replies,
"Oh, yes, that's right.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.000
"That's right, I knew
it was something common."

33:18.040 --> 33:20.000
HE SNICKERS

33:20.000 --> 33:20.880
HE SNICKERS

33:20.920 --> 33:22.800
You silly arse!

33:27.320 --> 33:30.000
LAUGHING

33:48.440 --> 33:50.000
What's funny?

33:50.000 --> 33:50.360
What's funny?

33:50.400 --> 33:52.200
Nothing.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.440
I was just thinking about my mother.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.200
Vashe zdorov'ye.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.560
Bottoms up.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.560
Tell me about your mother.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.440
She's dead now.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.360
Did she know about... your work?

34:11.400 --> 34:13.600
No.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.360
You were close?

34:21.920 --> 34:23.400
Very.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.840
KNOCK ON DOOR

34:45.880 --> 34:47.400
Evening, sir.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.200
Ooh.

34:56.240 --> 34:59.120
What?
Damp.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.880
Mould.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.560
Erm... Before you start,

35:08.600 --> 35:14.000
you should know that, officially,
I'm not here.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.560
Start what?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.400
OK.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.000
Oh, do you mean the CIA
don't officially know you're here,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.320
Oh, do you mean the CIA
don't officially know you're here,

35:21.360 --> 35:26.320
or your mission here hasn't been
officially rubber stamped?

35:26.360 --> 35:27.840
Mission?

35:29.440 --> 35:33.440
When the man from your embassy
dropped off an envelope...

35:35.600 --> 35:37.920
..this morning, was that official?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.200
And while you're unofficially here,

35:40.240 --> 35:45.040
are you by chance working on
anything of an intelligence...

35:46.680 --> 35:49.000
..or counter-intelligence nature

35:49.040 --> 35:50.000
that under normal circumstances
you'd tell us about?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.240
that under normal circumstances
you'd tell us about?

35:54.280 --> 35:57.280
Who sent you?
No-one.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.160
Young lady...

35:59.200 --> 36:01.520
This is just between us.

36:05.120 --> 36:09.680
Then I am sorry to say...
you've wasted your time.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.040
It's definitely mould.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.000
I'd ask for my money back
if I were you.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.160
I'd ask for my money back
if I were you.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.680
Ah, there you are, Nanny.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.960
IN RUSSIAN:

36:56.280 --> 36:57.560
What?

37:05.800 --> 37:07.080
IN RUSSIAN:

37:31.240 --> 37:33.040
CLEARS HER THROAT

37:35.000 --> 37:36.080
Mrs Thomas?

37:36.120 --> 37:38.520
Who's Vermehren?

37:38.560 --> 37:40.400
This really isn't the time or place.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.400
Do you know, er...

37:44.760 --> 37:46.200
SHE LAUGHS

37:46.240 --> 37:50.000
My husband, he's a man
who works incredibly hard,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.680
My husband, he's a man
who works incredibly hard,

37:52.720 --> 37:54.880
day in and day out...

37:54.920 --> 37:56.720
No, this'll only take a minute.

37:57.960 --> 38:03.040
..doing everything he can
to make people's lives better,

38:03.080 --> 38:08.800
while I stand here, trying to
nail down what on earth it is

38:08.840 --> 38:14.920
that you chaps have been playing at
for 20 years.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.200
And when I get home tonight,

38:17.240 --> 38:20.000
because he knows that I'm not
allowed to talk about my work,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.760
because he knows that I'm not
allowed to talk about my work,

38:21.800 --> 38:26.400
he'll pretend to be asleep
to make my life easier.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.400
So do you know what?

38:31.040 --> 38:33.960
I couldn't care less
about the time and the place.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.920
She's in there...
Ssh!

38:44.960 --> 38:46.520
'Come on, then.'

38:48.640 --> 38:50.000
What does he do, your husband?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.080
What does he do, your husband?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.520
A doctor. GP.

38:54.440 --> 38:59.840
Drinks are in there. Hands off
the silver, I'll be back in a jiffy.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.120
Message received.

40:13.200 --> 40:19.480
And so, old friend, one day
it'll just be you and me...

40:21.200 --> 40:24.880
You and I? You and me?

40:24.920 --> 40:27.200
Finish the sentence first.

40:27.240 --> 40:29.040
..against the Soviets.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.760
You and me.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.920
We sweat and strain.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.080
What's this?

40:37.120 --> 40:38.120
Open it.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.480
For the day when you and I can
only afford to trust each other

41:04.520 --> 41:07.120
and the West depends on us.

41:11.880 --> 41:15.000
"The hounds of the crimson sky
gave tongue,

41:15.040 --> 41:17.400
"but never a cry cried he."

41:32.840 --> 41:34.040
Where's this taken?

41:34.080 --> 41:35.360
Istanbul.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
During the war?

41:36.440 --> 41:37.680
Hm. '43.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.080
Our wedding day.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.440
You got married in Istanbul?

41:42.480 --> 41:44.200
'We were both posted there.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.480
'Your wife's SIS?

41:46.600 --> 41:47.600
'She was my secretary.

41:47.640 --> 41:48.880
'Oh!'

41:51.360 --> 41:52.000
Do you drink whisky?

41:52.000 --> 41:52.760
Do you drink whisky?

41:52.800 --> 41:54.600
Oh, if I must.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.680
You have that.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.360
After you.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.720
STATIC

42:14.760 --> 42:15.840
COUGHING

42:15.880 --> 42:17.240
What?

42:41.800 --> 42:47.280
My wife wants to know
whether you're friend or foe.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.360
It's funny, MI5 have
a similar question about you.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.000
HE CHUCKLES

42:52.000 --> 42:53.480
HE CHUCKLES

43:00.880 --> 43:02.560
Mud in your eye.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.960
THEY CLINK GLASSES

43:10.880 --> 43:12.440
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

43:17.800 --> 43:19.120
Erich Vermehren...

43:22.200 --> 43:25.320
..is a devout Catholic
who hated the Nazis...

43:29.040 --> 43:31.960
..and thought the best way to fight
them was from within.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.880
Until I came along.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.080
And Philby.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.320
HE SIGHS

43:49.360 --> 43:52.000
The truth is, had it not been
for Kim's innate ability

43:52.000 --> 43:54.280
The truth is, had it not been
for Kim's innate ability

43:54.320 --> 43:58.680
to be able to befriend almost anyone
under any circumstances,

43:58.720 --> 44:05.000
all my efforts to get Vermehren
to defect to England

44:05.040 --> 44:07.320
may have come to nought,

44:07.360 --> 44:09.720
and he may never have given us
the identities

44:09.760 --> 44:14.560
of the hundreds of Abwehr officers
and their sources all across Europe,

44:14.600 --> 44:19.440
which, it's no exaggeration to say,
changed the course of the war...

44:19.480 --> 44:21.640
'all the way to D-Day.'

44:21.680 --> 44:22.000
To us.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.440
To us.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.880
And getting away with it.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.240
Thank you.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.920
There you are.
Thank you.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.680
All he ever asked in return was...

44:40.560 --> 44:43.760
..we do what we could for his
friends in the German resistance,

44:43.800 --> 44:47.600
and we did,
we did with intelligence,

44:47.640 --> 44:51.320
and weapons drops
and radio equipment.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.480
It's about to rain.

45:04.880 --> 45:07.160
CHUCKLING

45:07.200 --> 45:08.960
Oh!

45:09.000 --> 45:13.080
THEY LAUGH

45:26.720 --> 45:29.040
Come on.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.640
What?

45:34.920 --> 45:36.520
What?

45:39.200 --> 45:40.680
Hindsight.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.840
HE SIGHS

46:08.560 --> 46:12.640
Just as Vermehren and his friends
in the Catholic resistance

46:12.680 --> 46:16.320
were anti-Nazi, they were also
fiercely anti-Bolshevik

46:16.360 --> 46:18.360
and determined that after the war,

46:18.400 --> 46:22.000
no part of Germany would ever fall
into the hands of the Russians.

46:22.000 --> 46:22.400
no part of Germany would ever fall
into the hands of the Russians.

46:23.440 --> 46:29.160
So... when Churchill and Roosevelt
and Stalin...

46:30.960 --> 46:33.160
..agreed how to carve up Germany...

46:34.640 --> 46:40.720
..Vermehren's friends who were faced
with being marooned

46:40.760 --> 46:42.760
in the Russian sector...

46:45.600 --> 46:48.720
..tried to make a break for it
to the British sector.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.840
CHATTERING

47:12.120 --> 47:14.000
SCREAMING

47:54.040 --> 47:56.200
Philby betrayed them
to the Russians?

48:01.720 --> 48:03.400
That's who Vermehren is.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.760
No. Only I, and now you,

48:09.800 --> 48:11.640
know anything about
what I've just told you.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.040
And the Russians.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.960
And the Russians.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.800
And Sir Anthony Blunt.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.720
That's what that was about.

48:30.840 --> 48:34.440
He knows about Vermehren
because he works for the Russians.

48:37.760 --> 48:40.800
Which is what Philby told you
in Beirut.

48:48.280 --> 48:50.040
So...

48:50.080 --> 48:51.960
what do I tell my wife?

48:53.680 --> 48:55.720
Friend or foe?

49:01.680 --> 49:03.360
Who else knows about Blunt?

49:04.640 --> 49:06.200
No-one.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.680
Just us.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.160
KNOCK AT DOOR

50:03.440 --> 50:05.240
KNOCKING CONTINUES

50:10.000 --> 50:12.040
Sorry for the late hour.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.280
Is this it?
Yes, sir.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.760
Good night.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.160
Jesus fucking...

50:29.280 --> 50:30.920
..Christ.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.240
WHISPERS: Ey, prosnis'.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.120
Hey, wake up!

51:08.480 --> 51:10.000
"The hounds...

51:11.880 --> 51:13.360
"..of the...

51:17.320 --> 51:18.960
"..crimson...

51:21.560 --> 51:22.000
"..sky...

51:22.000 --> 51:23.120
"..sky...

51:26.880 --> 51:28.400
"..gave...

51:31.120 --> 51:32.440
"..tongue.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.320
"But...

51:40.720 --> 51:42.520
"..never...

51:48.760 --> 51:50.360
"..a cry...

51:52.640 --> 51:54.240
"..cried he."

51:57.120 --> 51:59.200
We're in business.
