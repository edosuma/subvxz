Are you seriously
propositioning me?

20:01.594 --> 20:03.594
The day of my brother's funeral,

20:03.628 --> 20:08.361
I went out, got drunk,
picked up a guy at a bar,

20:08.394 --> 20:11.594
had the best sex
of my entire life.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.328
Yeah, that's one
way to grieve.

20:13.361 --> 20:14.728
This is mine.

20:14.761 --> 20:17.994
I just hate to see someone
hurting themselves

20:18.028 --> 20:19.994
when there's someone
who could do it for them.

a night to remember.

20:30.728 --> 20:33.661

I am your humble servant.

28:52.184 --> 28:53.551
I never gave
you permission

on my granddaughters.

28:55.851 --> 28:56.851
My apologies, Your Grace...

29:02.984 --> 29:05.518
Oh, Wendy,

29:05.551 --> 29:06.951
it's been so long.

29:06.984 --> 29:09.484
I could've waited
a little longer.

29:09.518 --> 29:12.318
Still my spirited daughter.
Nothing's changed.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.684
Except, of course,
uh, that necklace.

29:15.718 --> 29:18.484
You're on your
last life.

29:18.518 --> 29:21.051
We should do something
about that.

29:23.051 --> 29:24.684
Ah, my boy.

29:24.718 --> 29:26.684
Hello, Grandfather.

29:26.718 --> 29:28.684
You have nothing to fear.

29:28.718 --> 29:31.118
I understand you became confused

29:31.151 --> 29:33.284
after your journey
through the portal.

29:33.318 --> 29:36.018
Everything's different
than you thought it would be.

29:36.051 --> 29:39.118
Being with your mother again
and sisters,

29:39.151 --> 29:41.184
it was intoxicating.

29:41.218 --> 29:43.351
It's okay, my boy.

29:43.384 --> 29:45.451
Tarkoff...
Tortured you.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.718
He overstepped the bounds.
I shall deal with him.

29:47.751 --> 29:49.784
I know the carnage
it took

29:49.818 --> 29:53.718
to bring me here
weighs heavily upon you.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.184
You were always...

29:56.218 --> 29:58.184
a gentle child.

29:59.684 --> 30:01.051
I love you.

30:01.084 --> 30:02.818
I love you, too, Grandfather.

30:02.851 --> 30:05.551
Of course you do.
Now, come here.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.984
Sleep well, my angels.

30:23.818 --> 30:26.318
We'll be together again soon.

30:26.351 --> 30:28.484
What are you doing
down here?

30:28.518 --> 30:29.884
I drugged you and locked you in.

30:29.918 --> 30:31.218
Well, the elixir wore off,

30:31.251 --> 30:33.018
and I wanted to see the girls,

30:33.051 --> 30:35.851
so... I picked the locks.

30:35.884 --> 30:37.618
Okay, there's something
that I need to tell you.

30:37.651 --> 30:39.151
(door closes)

30:40.251 --> 30:42.384
Hello, Joanna.

30:42.418 --> 30:43.884
Wendy, what have you done?

30:43.918 --> 30:44.984
Okay, don't freak out.

30:45.018 --> 30:46.051
We did it for a very
good reason.

30:46.084 --> 30:47.784
You two worked together on this?

30:47.818 --> 30:49.484
Mom, we had to.
How could you?

30:49.518 --> 30:51.118
How could you bring
this man into our home?!

30:51.151 --> 30:52.818
He's gonna bring the girls back.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.484
I'd almost forgotten
how beautiful they were.

30:56.518 --> 30:58.051
I'm here to help.

30:58.084 --> 30:59.518
You don't help
without strings attached,

30:59.551 --> 31:01.651
and you know that
as well as I do.

31:01.684 --> 31:03.718
Okay, this isn't the way that
I saw it playing out either,

31:03.751 --> 31:05.051
but I had to do something.

31:05.084 --> 31:06.718
You were upstairs
carving your arms.

31:06.751 --> 31:09.051
You always had a flair
for the dramatic,

31:09.084 --> 31:10.484
even as a child.

31:10.518 --> 31:11.651
Shut the hell up!

31:11.684 --> 31:13.451
Such a mouth!

31:13.484 --> 31:14.684
Just hear him out, Mom.

31:14.718 --> 31:15.684
There's no other way.

31:15.718 --> 31:16.884
Stop it!

31:18.184 --> 31:19.518
Your servant Tarkoff did this.

31:19.551 --> 31:21.051
How am I supposed to believe

31:21.084 --> 31:23.018
he wasn't just
following your orders?

31:23.051 --> 31:24.484
NIKOLAUS:
Oh, Joanna.

31:24.518 --> 31:27.218
Did you really think
I went to all this trouble

31:27.251 --> 31:30.318
to come back
just to see you‐‐

31:30.351 --> 31:31.718
any of you‐‐ dead?

31:31.751 --> 31:33.218
If that was my goal,

31:33.251 --> 31:37.018
I could have achieved it
a million other ways.

31:37.051 --> 31:40.318
I do regret what has happened.

31:40.351 --> 31:42.551
And you should know...

31:42.584 --> 31:44.618
I'm back here

31:44.651 --> 31:47.484
to put the family
together,

31:47.518 --> 31:49.484
not tear them apart.

31:49.518 --> 31:51.218
He can bring
the girls back, Joanna.

31:51.251 --> 31:53.818
He's the only one who can.

31:56.918 --> 32:00.784
Has perdido el amor
mas importante de tu vida.

32:00.818 --> 32:03.184

to bother you, but, um...

32:06.084 --> 32:07.884

32:15.584 --> 32:17.551
She was my wife.

32:17.584 --> 32:20.651
Where is she now?

32:20.684 --> 32:22.218
She's dead.

32:24.351 --> 32:25.518
I should kill you.

32:26.884 --> 32:29.218
Why is that
everyone's go‐to today?

32:29.251 --> 32:31.851
Wait here, brujo.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.851
If what you
say is true,

32:33.884 --> 32:37.818
your journey from here on
will not be an easy one.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.451
What just happened?

33:08.484 --> 33:10.551
I thought we lost you.

33:10.584 --> 33:12.484
You were dead.

33:22.851 --> 33:26.118
Mom, while I was dead,

33:26.151 --> 33:28.551
my soul was here,

33:28.584 --> 33:30.384
trapped in the house.

33:30.418 --> 33:33.618
You couldn't see me,

33:33.651 --> 33:35.884

And I was on some

33:37.484 --> 33:41.218
strange boat...
on a river.

33:41.251 --> 33:43.618
It was dark and foggy

33:43.651 --> 33:45.451
and really creepy.

33:45.484 --> 33:47.051
Sweetie,
that's the Underworld.

33:47.084 --> 33:49.851
No place for a

33:49.884 --> 33:51.284
This is our grandfather?

33:51.318 --> 33:53.351
The one you guys
are always talking about?

33:53.384 --> 33:55.051
I thought you hated him.

33:55.084 --> 33:58.351
I'm sorry. It's just,
they always said they hated you.

33:58.384 --> 33:59.984
WENDY:
Oh, no, we still hate him,

34:00.018 --> 34:02.218
but he's the one who brought
you back, so things have

34:02.251 --> 34:04.718
become quite awkward.
Well, thank you.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.718
But how? I mean, I thought
there were consequences.

34:07.751 --> 34:11.618
For most, maybe,
but, um... not for me.

34:11.651 --> 34:14.151
I have missed you all,

34:14.184 --> 34:16.851
and I know you
have missed home.

34:16.884 --> 34:19.951
Let's put the bad blood
behind us

34:19.984 --> 34:24.284
and mark today
as a new beginning.

34:24.318 --> 34:26.618
JOANNA: You're asking us
to forgive a lot,

34:26.651 --> 34:28.784
to forget about a lot.

34:28.818 --> 34:31.384
We must never
forget our past.

34:31.418 --> 34:35.818
Remembering our mistakes
prevents us from repeating them.

34:35.851 --> 34:38.218
Not that you would ever lie, but
how can we trust you, Father?

34:38.251 --> 34:39.984
I am old.

34:40.018 --> 34:43.884
My magic may be strong,
but my body is weak.

34:43.918 --> 34:47.318
I simply want
my loved ones around me again.

34:48.318 --> 34:51.784
Please come home.

34:51.818 --> 34:54.218
It's time
for the family to heal.

35:00.818 --> 35:03.518
There is something
I must know about you.

35:22.384 --> 35:26.551
Cover one of these
with your hand... now.

35:40.751 --> 35:42.684
(groaning)

35:47.818 --> 35:49.151
Es él.

35:49.184 --> 35:50.184
(Killian sighs)

35:54.318 --> 35:55.984
(groaning)

36:05.418 --> 36:07.584
Sana.

36:10.384 --> 36:11.784
You look just like...

36:11.818 --> 36:12.818
I know.

36:12.851 --> 36:14.818
Eva was my great‐grandmother.

36:23.318 --> 36:26.684
I know why he was sent to us.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.851
First, you tried
to stop Tarkoff

36:37.884 --> 36:39.851
because you didn't want
the king to come here,

36:39.884 --> 36:41.184
and now you're
a true believer?

36:41.218 --> 36:43.384
I believe he did
the right thing.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.184
He brought Ingrid and Freya
back, and I've believed

36:45.218 --> 36:46.984
in the good in him
for a long time.

36:47.018 --> 36:49.351
I know it's still there.
Frederick, he tortured you.

36:49.384 --> 36:51.018
It's not that simple.

36:51.051 --> 36:53.018
Yeah, he abused
me, you're right,

36:53.051 --> 36:55.484
but he realized he was wrong,
and eventually he set me free.

36:55.518 --> 36:57.518
That's why I carried him
with me through the portal.

36:57.551 --> 37:00.551
He's changed. I know he has,
and it took him a long time.

37:00.584 --> 37:02.451
He's clever.
He's been ill.

37:02.484 --> 37:03.618
Very ill.

37:03.651 --> 37:04.984
And it finally
made him stop

37:05.018 --> 37:06.784
and think about
what he'd done

37:06.818 --> 37:10.018
to all of us, and I
know he regrets it.

37:10.051 --> 37:12.784
Look, I think this is our
chance for a new beginning.

37:12.818 --> 37:14.518
At what cost?

37:14.551 --> 37:18.518
How many people in East End had
to die in order to get him here?

37:18.551 --> 37:21.118
No, that's exactly why I didn't
want to go through with it.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.651
I hated killing innocents,
and I hated the cost

37:23.684 --> 37:25.984
of finding a host, but
Grandfather's here now.

37:26.018 --> 37:28.784
And we're lucky he is, 'cause
he saved your daughters.

37:28.818 --> 37:32.551
Just... please just
go talk to him.

37:44.018 --> 37:45.884
(groans softly)

37:51.151 --> 37:52.751
(groaning)

38:12.851 --> 38:14.318
(line ringing)

38:14.351 --> 38:16.718
(cell phone ringing)

38:16.751 --> 38:18.218
This is Moreau.

38:18.251 --> 38:19.884
DASH:
So that's your name.

38:19.918 --> 38:21.318
Morning, cowboy.

38:21.351 --> 38:22.718
What are you doing tonight?

38:22.751 --> 38:24.151
You, 10:00.

38:24.184 --> 38:26.051
That's a good answer.

38:26.084 --> 38:27.684
I'll text you where.

38:27.718 --> 38:29.784
Oh, someone likes giving orders.

38:29.818 --> 38:32.218
Only 'cause you're so good
at taking them.

38:35.018 --> 38:37.784
(siren wailing)

38:37.818 --> 38:39.551
MAN:
Go ahead.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.584
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

38:43.384 --> 38:45.184
What do we got?

38:45.218 --> 38:47.718
Fish bait. Best guess, he's been
in the water about a month.

38:47.751 --> 38:49.318
Anything carved in his chest?

38:49.351 --> 38:50.784
No, not like the others.

38:50.818 --> 38:52.551
What's he covered in, tar?

38:52.584 --> 38:54.151
You'd think, but no.

38:54.184 --> 38:56.518
It's thinner than tar.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.318
Smells like sulfur.

38:58.351 --> 38:59.984
I'll send it
to the lab.

39:00.018 --> 39:02.384
So who is he?

39:02.418 --> 39:04.451
No I. D., but the
teeth are intact.

39:04.484 --> 39:05.784
Shouldn't take
too long.

39:05.818 --> 39:08.984
I'm not going anywhere.

39:09.018 --> 39:11.151
JOANNA:
We're all going to leave
right away.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.018
You're taking jewelry?

39:14.051 --> 39:16.051
Should we all grab
something sentimental?
No.

39:16.084 --> 39:17.818
We got to leave right now.

39:17.851 --> 39:20.184
Mom, is this for real? Are
we really going to Asgard?

39:20.218 --> 39:21.984
Oh, God, no,
we're not going to Asgard.

39:22.018 --> 39:23.684
We're going
to the past.

39:23.718 --> 39:25.518
So, now we're gonna
use the time door?

39:25.551 --> 39:27.818
Time door?
Time door?
What's a time door?

39:27.851 --> 39:30.151
You already said
we can't change the past.

39:30.184 --> 39:32.484
We can't, but that's not
why we're going back.

39:32.518 --> 39:34.618
There's something
that I need to get.

39:34.651 --> 39:36.218
We need to get
something from the past?

39:36.251 --> 39:38.318
It's‐it's something
I used to own.

39:38.351 --> 39:41.184
I need to go back
and get it from myself.

39:41.218 --> 39:42.684
It's already happened, actually.

39:42.718 --> 39:45.018
I just need
to complete the circle.

39:45.051 --> 39:47.151
Wait. What?
What are you
talking about?

39:48.684 --> 39:50.884
Your grandfather hasn't
embraced the family.

39:50.918 --> 39:52.451
It's all lies.

39:52.484 --> 39:54.851
I know him. He's buttering
us up for something.

39:54.884 --> 39:56.318
I just don't know what.

39:56.351 --> 39:58.818
But he brought
us back to life.

39:58.851 --> 40:00.818
I know, but you don't
know him like I do.

40:00.851 --> 40:02.218
We don't know
him at all.

40:02.251 --> 40:04.118
But we know Mom,
and we have to trust her.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.751
We got to leave this instant.

40:11.251 --> 40:15.084
Patere nos introitum.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.484
Wendy, go first.
Here, hold hands. Here.

40:21.518 --> 40:23.984
Here, take my hand.
Come on.

40:25.018 --> 40:26.118
I'm staying.

40:26.151 --> 40:28.151
Ingrid, no!

40:37.184 --> 40:39.184
(whooshing)

40:42.151 --> 40:45.784
(gasping)

40:45.818 --> 40:48.684
Oh, my God.

40:48.718 --> 40:49.684
I don't believe it.

40:49.718 --> 40:51.218
Where is Ingrid?

40:51.251 --> 40:52.718
She stayed.

40:55.918 --> 40:57.184
Holy shit,
I remember this place.

40:57.218 --> 40:59.351
Where the hell are we?

40:59.384 --> 41:01.718
Come on, we don't
have a lot of time.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.018
(horses neighing)

41:03.051 --> 41:05.251
(indistinct chatter)

41:09.484 --> 41:12.184
(bell clanging)

41:12.218 --> 41:16.218
