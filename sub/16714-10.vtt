00:29.719 --> 00:32.485
All right, ladies, let's do this.

00:43.032 --> 00:45.599
Whoo!

01:15.832 --> 01:18.332
Aah!

03:04.674 --> 03:07.441
It's a little early out on
the West Coast, isn't it?

03:07.443 --> 03:10.644
Yeah, well, you know, something
weird is happening out here.

03:10.646 --> 03:12.980
Now that you're in the BAU,

03:12.982 --> 03:15.549
you might want to check it out.

03:16.106 --> 03:18.219
I know it's not Scratch-related,

03:18.221 --> 03:20.321
but my buddy at Miramar Air Force Base

03:20.323 --> 03:21.389
says it's worth a look.

03:21.524 --> 03:23.357
Home invasion murders
in upscale neighborhoods.

03:23.359 --> 03:25.059
Each victim shot once.

03:25.061 --> 03:28.562
The coordination needed
to pull this off says gang.

03:28.564 --> 03:31.532
They really did a
number on these houses.

03:31.534 --> 03:34.535
Well, to be honest, this reminds
me a little of a terrorist cell,

03:34.537 --> 03:38.973
only all nihilism and no ideology.

03:38.975 --> 03:42.209
Ok, let's see what the
rest of the team thinks.

03:42.211 --> 03:44.512
Rick and Lenore Purcell
are the latest victims

03:44.514 --> 03:48.549
of burglary-homicides in
wealthy San Diego neighborhoods.

03:48.551 --> 03:51.018
Last week the same
happened to Janelle Klecker

03:51.020 --> 03:53.754
while her husband was
out of town on business.

03:53.756 --> 03:55.990
Janelle Klecker lived in Del Mar.

03:55.992 --> 03:57.191
That's 7 miles away.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.226
The Purcells were in Rancho Santa Fe.

03:59.228 --> 04:00.794
Well, quite the party.

04:00.796 --> 04:02.596
Narcotics, booze, vandalism.

04:02.598 --> 04:04.965
Seems there was a fashion show.

04:04.967 --> 04:07.301
Yeah, those are all women's clothing.

04:07.303 --> 04:09.203
It looks like our gang's
both male and female.

04:09.205 --> 04:13.073
Girls are just as susceptible
as boys to gang recruitment.

04:13.075 --> 04:15.309
According to the National
Youth Gang Center,

04:15.311 --> 04:17.043
about 20% are females.

04:17.046 --> 04:19.680
Often people join gangs
for the sense of belonging,

04:19.682 --> 04:21.315
and if they're socially isolated,

04:21.317 --> 04:23.951
it provides them with a sense
of family for the first time.

04:23.953 --> 04:26.120
Yeah, gangs also tend
to follow a hierarchy.

04:26.122 --> 04:27.521
Alpha on top, then muscle,

04:27.523 --> 04:30.558
devout right hand,
and then the soldiers.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.495
So it looks like both times
they grabbed cash and electronics

04:34.497 --> 04:37.031
but avoided jewels and art.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.899
Well, that could be 'cause
they know what's easy to sell

04:38.901 --> 04:42.136
and hard to track. That makes
them criminally-experienced.

04:42.138 --> 04:44.672
Which is likely considering
they moved in and out

04:44.674 --> 04:47.174
without witnesses or triggering alarms.

04:47.176 --> 04:50.110
But it is hard to maintain
that level or organization

04:50.112 --> 04:51.078
when you're high.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.080
An M.O. mismatch like that

04:53.082 --> 04:55.149
could have been caused
by group dynamics.

04:55.151 --> 04:56.850
Too many cooks in the kitchen.

04:56.852 --> 04:59.186
They should have waited until
the house was empty but didn't.

04:59.188 --> 05:01.288
The gang could be thrill-seekers.

05:01.290 --> 05:04.158
Could have been why the residents
were there when it happened.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.560
Once is an accident, twice a trend.

05:06.562 --> 05:08.596
Garcia, see if any of
the victims have secrets.

05:08.598 --> 05:10.664
Skeletons in the closet, my specialty.

05:10.666 --> 05:14.068
They could be targeting random
victims or working off a list.

05:14.070 --> 05:16.470
It's difficult to tell
which from the files.

05:16.472 --> 05:17.738
Look, I know I'm new here,

05:17.740 --> 05:21.008
but to me it seems like they won't stop.

05:21.010 --> 05:22.810
I'd rather fly out
there and find nothing

05:22.812 --> 05:27.181
than stay here and see more
bodies drop. Wheels up in 20.

05:29.852 --> 05:32.886
Hello, ma'am. Can I have
a moment of your time?

05:32.888 --> 05:36.423
My little brother has
bone marrow cancer,

05:36.425 --> 05:39.627
and our family can't afford
the costly treatments.

05:39.629 --> 05:43.364
I'm gathering donations to
help pay for his radiation,

05:43.366 --> 05:45.532
chemotherapy, and recovery.

05:45.534 --> 05:46.867
It's gonna be a long road for him,

05:46.869 --> 05:49.803
but with support like yours,
my brother has a chance

05:49.805 --> 05:50.938
to fight this disease.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.640
Everybody's affected by cancer.

05:52.642 --> 05:54.074
Mom, Dad,

05:54.076 --> 05:55.809
brother, sister, friend,

05:55.811 --> 05:57.344
husband, wife.

05:57.346 --> 05:59.079
I know times are tough,

05:59.081 --> 06:00.581
but every bit counts.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.883
Would you like to help?

06:02.885 --> 06:04.051
Would you like to help?

06:04.053 --> 06:06.286
I wish I could.

06:06.288 --> 06:09.356
Would you like to help?

06:09.358 --> 06:12.793
Why don't you come inside
while I get my checkbook.

06:15.798 --> 06:17.898
Have a seat. I'll only be a second.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.566
You have a lovely home.

06:19.568 --> 06:21.869
Oh, thank you, dear.

06:39.846 --> 06:40.747
Synced and corrected by deglinglau
www.addic7ed.com

07:12.513 --> 07:14.713
"Now, we'll start this band of robbers"

07:14.715 --> 07:16.749
"and call it Tom Sawyer's gang.

07:16.751 --> 07:20.052
"Everybody that wants to
join has to take an oath

07:20.054 --> 07:22.955
and write his name in blood."

07:22.957 --> 07:24.223
Mark Twain.

07:26.074 --> 07:27.608
Rick Purcell was a financial planner.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.495
His wife Lenore ran
a high-end boutique.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.208
It says here they have no kids,

07:32.210 --> 07:33.776
no extended family either.

07:33.778 --> 07:35.345
Janelle Klecker, our first victim,

07:35.347 --> 07:37.547
she was the CFO of a
major accounting firm.

07:37.549 --> 07:40.350
Her husband Dan owned strip
malls along the West Coast.

07:40.352 --> 07:43.686
They also don't have kids, but
plenty of nieces and nephews.

07:43.688 --> 07:46.856
Childless couples could be part
of their victim selection criteria.

07:46.858 --> 07:49.258
Ok, I have looked inside and
out of these people's lives

07:49.260 --> 07:51.861
and their closets are void of skeletons.

07:51.863 --> 07:54.731
Aside from geography and
class, there's zero overlap.

07:54.733 --> 07:56.933
What do we think is
motivating this gang?

07:56.935 --> 07:59.202
Murder? Theft?

07:59.204 --> 08:01.771
Maybe it's both.
We have evidence of cocaine,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.573
marijuana, speed, alcohol.

08:03.575 --> 08:06.042
That level of drug use
must affect their focus.

08:06.044 --> 08:08.010
But to pull off a
coordinated attack like this,

08:08.012 --> 08:09.345
at least one of them is sober.

08:09.347 --> 08:10.847
Well, it could be the Alpha.

08:10.849 --> 08:12.815
Maybe he's using the drugs
to control the others.

08:12.817 --> 08:14.851
Well, if the shooter's
the same for each one,

08:14.853 --> 08:16.119
my money's on the Alpha.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.520
It depends. Some gang leaders

08:17.522 --> 08:18.955
are willing to get their hands dirty,

08:18.957 --> 08:20.256
others aren't.

08:20.258 --> 08:22.024
Ok, when we land, Luke,
Rossi, head to the M.E.

08:22.026 --> 08:23.426
Walker, set up with the local P.D.,

08:23.428 --> 08:26.329
and JJ and I will go to
the Purcell crime scene.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.833
Thank you for the donation, Mrs. Vendl.

08:30.835 --> 08:33.903
Of course. And your brother
will be in our prayers.

08:46.384 --> 08:48.384
They're perfect.

08:49.554 --> 08:50.720
Good work, babe.

08:50.722 --> 08:52.855
All right, get ready, boys and girls,

08:52.857 --> 08:54.056
we found our next score.

08:54.058 --> 08:55.825
Yeah! Whoo!

09:02.710 --> 09:05.344
C.O.D.'s a single gunshot
wound to the forehead.

09:05.346 --> 09:08.681
Ballistics confirms a
suppressed compact 9-millimeter

09:08.683 --> 09:10.049
was used both times.

09:10.051 --> 09:12.551
A relatively common firearm.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.586
Any sexual assault?

09:13.756 --> 09:14.587
None.

09:14.634 --> 09:17.189
Home invasion victims
are often blitz attacked.

09:17.191 --> 09:19.258
But not here. No defensive wounds,

09:19.260 --> 09:20.659
no blunt-force trauma.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.629
Then the unsubs likely used
the gun to control them.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.031
Ligature marks on the wrists,

09:26.033 --> 09:29.034
not overly abrasive. What was used?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.903
Household items.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.404
Janelle Klecker, a man's tie.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.839
Probably her husband's.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.208
The Purcells, a woman's belt

09:36.210 --> 09:37.843
and a phone charger cord.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.778
You see this?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.814
The contact wounds look the same.

09:41.816 --> 09:45.185
Did the first victim have one
in roughly the same spot?

09:45.643 --> 09:47.443
Yes, almost exactly.

09:47.445 --> 09:50.813
Hmm. Same weapon, same barrel placement,

09:50.815 --> 09:52.115
same downward angle.

09:52.117 --> 09:53.883
You add it up, it's a single shooter.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.418
Whoever it was had to be sober

09:55.420 --> 09:57.854
to maintain this level of self-control.

09:57.856 --> 10:00.056
So, there's one shooter, clearheaded,

10:00.058 --> 10:02.358
controlled, mature, on the hunt,

10:02.360 --> 10:06.963
while the others go along
on a drug-fueled party binge.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.592
Alvez and Rossi figure the
shooter was sober enough

10:11.592 --> 10:13.635
to maintain self-control throughout.

10:13.635 --> 10:15.860
Which means he's likely our Alpha.

10:15.860 --> 10:18.460
It seems our Alpha has a muscle,

10:18.462 --> 10:21.030
because whoever did this is strong.

10:21.032 --> 10:23.098
Given this physicality,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.501
it's likely a male,

10:25.503 --> 10:31.240
whose rage is easy to
set off but also manage.

10:31.242 --> 10:35.544
Anger created by an
event in childhood, maybe.

10:35.546 --> 10:36.812
It's hard to see evidence of it,

10:36.814 --> 10:38.113
but based on group dynamics,

10:38.115 --> 10:40.783
we know this leader
has a devout right hand.

10:42.238 --> 10:45.645
That person is an unwavering extension
of the Alpha,

10:45.645 --> 10:49.443
providing him
with unconditional support.

11:11.060 --> 11:13.620
But the level of immaturity right here

11:13.620 --> 11:15.663
is a 180 from the Alpha.

11:16.196 --> 11:18.230
That's the problem with group dynamics.

11:18.232 --> 11:20.699
Different personalities,
different agendas.

11:20.701 --> 11:24.603
This vandalism is likely
courtesy of the gang's soldiers.

11:24.605 --> 11:26.338
Impressionable
and eager, they're probably

11:26.340 --> 11:27.639
the youngest members.

11:27.641 --> 11:30.008
Could have escaped a
negative home life, too,

11:30.010 --> 11:32.644
with the leader acting as
the father figure they crave.

11:32.646 --> 11:35.580
And if the Alpha supplied
them with drugs and alcohol,

11:35.582 --> 11:38.884
it would make them easier to control.

11:38.886 --> 11:42.254
Police said the music was
cranked up when they arrived.

11:42.256 --> 11:43.955
With the distance between the houses,

11:43.957 --> 11:46.558
I doubt the neighbors heard
anything, even gunshots.

11:46.560 --> 11:52.697
So the shooter could have killed
them out here, but instead...

11:54.501 --> 11:58.103
He kept them isolated, in here.

11:58.105 --> 12:02.607
Maybe one of them can't
stomach the violence.

12:02.609 --> 12:06.144
Yeah, but still, the shooter
wouldn't need a suppressor.

12:06.146 --> 12:08.079
True.

12:08.081 --> 12:13.753
Unless he didn't want
someone in the house to hear.

12:25.198 --> 12:27.799
What if the other members
don't know about the killings?

12:32.773 --> 12:35.674
Nothing here says these
victims were targeted.

12:35.676 --> 12:37.208
So far they appear random.

12:37.210 --> 12:39.778
In an area like this,
a ruse would work best.

12:39.780 --> 12:42.113
A fake injury, claim to
be looking for a lost pet.

12:42.115 --> 12:44.282
Well, whatever it was,
they would need to quietly

12:44.284 --> 12:47.052
see the most potential
victims in the shortest time.

12:47.054 --> 12:50.655
I've seen houses in the area
with the "no soliciting" signs.

12:50.657 --> 12:53.124
Suggests it happens.
Maybe that's the ruse.

12:53.126 --> 12:55.026
Around here, residents wouldn't hesitate

12:55.028 --> 12:57.829
to call the police about a peddler.

12:57.831 --> 13:01.299
Unless maybe they're
young and innocent-looking.

13:01.301 --> 13:04.769
They could be selling
magazines or candy for a cause.

13:04.771 --> 13:06.571
That would definitely
tug at the heartstrings.

13:06.573 --> 13:09.407
It would also allow them
time to canvass thoroughly.

13:09.409 --> 13:11.443
Ok, the local P.D.
needs to re-interview

13:11.445 --> 13:14.179
both areas on the lookout for that ruse.

13:17.918 --> 13:20.585
Locals re-canvassed
the area like we asked.

13:20.587 --> 13:23.388
And numerous people
reported 3 different women

13:23.390 --> 13:26.458
asking for donations to help
with a brother's cancer treatment.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.361
That's how they determine
victim vulnerability.

13:29.363 --> 13:33.098
Get inside, case the
people in their home,

13:33.100 --> 13:35.534
report back to the Alpha.

13:36.236 --> 13:39.004
I was with Dan Klecker,
Janelle’s widower.

13:39.006 --> 13:41.373
They were on vacation for two weeks.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.441
Came home the day before her murder.

13:43.443 --> 13:45.744
And apparently the unsubs
waited for someone to be home.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.879
They could have targeted her then.

13:47.881 --> 13:49.781
In addition to looking at
the victim and the house,

13:49.783 --> 13:51.416
they build a rapport.

13:51.418 --> 13:53.718
Which they'd have to
visit multiple times to do.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.420
That way, when they return,

13:55.422 --> 13:56.621
the victim opens the door willingly,

13:56.623 --> 13:58.390
and with security disarmed,

13:58.392 --> 14:00.525
the gang can easily
overwhelm the victims.

14:00.527 --> 14:02.627
I'm gonna go to evidence and
take a look at the checkbooks,

14:02.629 --> 14:04.062
see if anyone made a donation.

14:04.064 --> 14:05.630
Maybe the unsubs were arrogant

14:05.632 --> 14:07.365
or desperate enough to cash a check.

14:07.367 --> 14:10.468
Plenty of kind,
trusting people out there

14:10.470 --> 14:11.904
to fall for a scam like this.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.306
Who is it?

14:15.308 --> 14:17.742
Hey, it's me. We met
yesterday, remember?

14:17.744 --> 14:19.110
I think I left my scarf.

14:19.112 --> 14:20.879
Why, yes, you did.

14:25.719 --> 14:29.521
Get down! Get down! Get down!

14:29.523 --> 14:32.190
Aah!

14:34.895 --> 14:37.730
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

14:38.143 --> 14:39.409
Claire?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.244
What's going on?

14:45.344 --> 14:46.416
Hey, what...

14:51.356 --> 14:52.355
Hey! Uhh!

14:52.357 --> 14:54.224
Uhh!

14:54.226 --> 14:56.025
Oh, hello.

14:56.027 --> 14:57.126
Mmm...

14:57.128 --> 14:58.294
Ugh!

14:58.296 --> 15:00.129
Aah! What do you think, babe, huh?

15:00.131 --> 15:01.664
Time to have some fun?

15:01.666 --> 15:03.032
Sure is.

15:03.034 --> 15:05.134
Yay!

15:11.109 --> 15:13.209
I got too wasted last time.

15:13.211 --> 15:16.212
Come on, it's one little drink.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.323
Hey, Zeke.

15:27.325 --> 15:28.992
This place is toast, man.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.194
You want to bail?

15:37.469 --> 15:39.603
No.

15:40.905 --> 15:42.605
We've been rude.

15:42.607 --> 15:46.409
We'll let our hosts join us first.

15:46.411 --> 15:49.279
Zeke, man, come on.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.301
Come on. Hurry.

16:11.330 --> 16:14.704
- Let's go.
- Hey. Hey!

16:14.706 --> 16:18.474
Please don't hurt our family.

16:18.476 --> 16:20.243
What the hell, man?

16:20.245 --> 16:21.344
They saw my face!

16:21.646 --> 16:23.813
Get down here.

16:23.815 --> 16:26.816
Please. Please.

16:26.818 --> 16:27.584
Please!

16:27.616 --> 16:28.585
Zeke, you can't!

16:37.729 --> 16:40.096
Now we can go.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.160
We gotta split.

16:53.162 --> 16:55.229
All 3 of us.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.213
And go where?

16:56.510 --> 16:58.210
I don't know. Who cares?

16:58.212 --> 16:59.377
We'll figure it out.

16:59.379 --> 17:00.745
Without Zeke?

17:00.747 --> 17:01.847
I don't know.

17:01.849 --> 17:04.816
I mean, I owe him my life.

17:04.818 --> 17:06.318
Zeke's lost it.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.121
After what he did, we have no choice.

17:13.037 --> 17:14.277
Ok.

17:15.095 --> 17:18.230
I mean, if you think so.

17:18.232 --> 17:21.766
Well, I ain't goin'.

17:21.768 --> 17:23.935
No way.

17:23.936 --> 17:26.104
Quit being babies.

17:26.106 --> 17:29.040
Zeke always knows
exactly what he's doing.

17:29.042 --> 17:30.308
I'm sure he had his reasons.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.377
He murdered those people, Viv.

17:32.379 --> 17:34.579
He's out of his mind.

17:35.849 --> 17:38.283
We steal.

17:38.285 --> 17:39.784
We party.

17:39.786 --> 17:43.088
We are not killers.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.223
We'll wait a couple nights.

17:45.225 --> 17:48.326
After that, when they're off doing...

17:48.328 --> 17:49.895
You want to leave Bea?

17:49.897 --> 17:52.497
She's been like a sister to us.

17:52.499 --> 17:54.966
Did you see her face?

17:54.968 --> 17:56.735
She liked it.

17:56.737 --> 17:59.804
No mayo, right, Kay?

18:04.378 --> 18:05.977
Something wrong?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.719
Let's go.

18:14.721 --> 18:17.122
Ok.

18:41.148 --> 18:43.381
Victims are Claire and Joe Vendl,

18:43.383 --> 18:44.883
with two adult children.

18:44.885 --> 18:47.485
Neither live at home. And no pets.

18:47.487 --> 18:48.987
Who called it in?

18:48.989 --> 18:51.756
A private security patrol
saw their front door open,

18:51.758 --> 18:54.392
lights on. Gang was long gone.

18:54.394 --> 18:58.163
Whether or not they're
getting bolder or sloppy,

18:58.165 --> 18:59.231
the party's over.

18:59.233 --> 19:01.066
The wounds match the previous victims.

19:01.068 --> 19:03.168
It looks like the same shooter.

19:03.170 --> 19:05.637
The geography of the
victims, the way they fell,

19:05.639 --> 19:09.741
means the shooter was likely here.

19:09.743 --> 19:14.246
And based on this blood
spatter pattern shadow,

19:14.248 --> 19:17.682
a gang member could
have been in this spot.

19:20.087 --> 19:21.820
Janelle Klecker and the Purcells

19:21.822 --> 19:25.257
were murdered in private,
away from the party.

19:25.259 --> 19:26.524
This time the Alpha made a choice

19:26.526 --> 19:28.426
to kill in front of the gang.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.162
But why the change?

19:31.164 --> 19:33.331
Is the shooter devolving?

19:33.333 --> 19:35.000
Could be part of it?

19:35.002 --> 19:37.402
A shift like this demands the
others' attention and respect.

19:37.404 --> 19:39.804
The Alpha could be losing control.

19:39.806 --> 19:42.274
So this could be a last-ditch effort

19:42.276 --> 19:43.908
to reassert his dominance.

19:43.910 --> 19:47.879
Hey, agents. You might want to see this.

19:50.284 --> 19:51.383
Thanks, babe.

19:51.385 --> 19:52.852
Yeah.

19:56.189 --> 19:58.156
Something wrong?

19:58.158 --> 20:00.859
Had too man fries, I guess.

20:00.861 --> 20:03.361
Eat up. You need your strength.

20:09.703 --> 20:11.870
Heard y'all want to leave.

20:15.876 --> 20:18.510
Forget about the plan?

20:18.512 --> 20:20.211
Kay!

20:20.213 --> 20:24.082
You would have died on
the streets without Zeke.

20:24.084 --> 20:28.086
And what about you, Germ, huh?

20:28.088 --> 20:31.089
Broken, nowhere to go, no direction.

20:31.091 --> 20:35.026
Zeke gave you a purpose.

20:36.496 --> 20:40.332
And, Viv, turning tricks for cash.

20:40.334 --> 20:42.233
Now you don't have to.

20:42.235 --> 20:44.769
All 'cause of Zeke.

20:46.273 --> 20:48.640
He's your savior.
You should be worshipping him,

20:48.642 --> 20:51.109
but instead you want to go?

20:51.111 --> 20:54.279
Zeke brought us together
and made us a family.

20:54.281 --> 20:56.314
Don't you give a damn about family?

20:56.316 --> 20:57.716
Bea.

21:01.021 --> 21:05.223
Look, we hit enough of these houses.

21:05.225 --> 21:07.025
You ain't gotta live
like animals no more.

21:07.027 --> 21:10.795
But if you give up now, you are
exactly what they say you are...

21:10.797 --> 21:13.431
Nothing. Nobody.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.967
And they win.

21:17.571 --> 21:22.107
You really want them to win?

21:22.109 --> 21:25.543
But you stay the course,
I'll give you a future.

21:28.279 --> 21:29.245
Ok.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.552
Yeah.

21:40.111 --> 21:41.171
I'm bored.

21:45.866 --> 21:49.000
Mmm.

21:52.214 --> 21:54.213
Their faces were burnt out.

21:54.251 --> 21:55.417
Vandalism is normal,

21:55.419 --> 21:56.518
but this is the first time

21:56.520 --> 21:58.120
we've seen this kind of rage.

21:58.122 --> 21:59.722
We said the party's over.

21:59.724 --> 22:01.423
Maybe this is the next step.

22:01.425 --> 22:03.225
The destruction of this photo

22:03.227 --> 22:05.694
is more emotional than
the actual murders.

22:05.696 --> 22:07.329
And for one of the gang members,

22:07.331 --> 22:08.931
this picture's personal.

22:08.933 --> 22:12.701
This type of anger is usually
directed toward a person.

22:12.703 --> 22:15.504
This is an entire group,
and not just any group.

22:15.506 --> 22:17.306
A nuclear family.

22:17.308 --> 22:19.775
So one of them has an issue with theirs

22:19.777 --> 22:21.210
even more so than the rest.

22:21.212 --> 22:23.712
If the Alpha did this,

22:23.714 --> 22:26.548
it's likely his family
lives in the area.

22:26.550 --> 22:28.083
Why not go after them first?

22:28.085 --> 22:29.351
Hanging around is dangerous.

22:29.353 --> 22:31.186
The family could be out of town.

22:31.188 --> 22:33.055
Maybe the gang's waiting for them.

22:33.057 --> 22:36.859
That's not the only change here.

22:36.861 --> 22:39.795
The unsubs usually take liquid assets...

22:39.797 --> 22:41.196
Cash, electronics.

22:41.198 --> 22:43.599
But here, they took nothing.

22:43.601 --> 22:45.834
It seems our gang's becoming unglued

22:45.836 --> 22:47.836
faster than we predicted.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.708
Ok. Get the good beer.

22:52.710 --> 22:54.576
And no menthols this time.

22:54.578 --> 22:56.378
Yeah, sure thing.

22:56.380 --> 22:59.948
You, too, girls. I need a
minute alone with my boy.

23:14.865 --> 23:16.765
Sorry about before.

23:16.767 --> 23:20.068
My head just got all messed up.

23:20.070 --> 23:21.737
You know?

23:21.739 --> 23:23.605
I mean, look at this shirt.

23:23.607 --> 23:26.108
Ruined.

23:26.110 --> 23:28.010
Yeah, that's a good shirt.

23:28.012 --> 23:30.145
It's my favorite.

23:30.147 --> 23:33.015
I don't know, man.

23:33.017 --> 23:35.117
Like we have fun.

23:35.119 --> 23:36.785
We take stuff.

23:36.787 --> 23:38.053
And that's cool, 'cause, whatever,

23:38.055 --> 23:43.325
they're rich. They can always buy more.

23:43.327 --> 23:46.295
This murder.

23:46.297 --> 23:47.763
It ain't the plan.

23:47.765 --> 23:49.231
Plans change.

23:53.137 --> 23:54.937
Like I said, we gotta stick together.

23:54.939 --> 23:57.639
All right, I mean, think about Kay.

23:57.641 --> 24:01.009
She sees that you're strong,
she's gonna stay strong, too.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.449
Yeah.

24:07.451 --> 24:12.455
There, that's my boy. Come here.

24:13.757 --> 24:16.558
I could use another taste.
How about you?

24:16.560 --> 24:20.162
For sure, man. For sure.

24:26.303 --> 24:28.904
All right, you first.

24:32.343 --> 24:34.209
You've gone soft.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.378
That ain't good for the others.

24:38.749 --> 24:40.716
Come on, on your knees.

24:40.718 --> 24:42.985
Now.

24:46.624 --> 24:48.223
Forgot my...

25:10.804 --> 25:14.072
Yeah, it's the same caliber gun.

25:14.074 --> 25:16.408
And with this motel centrally located

25:16.410 --> 25:19.004
to the crime scenes,
he must be one of ours.

25:19.041 --> 25:22.442
As predicted, they finally
turned on their own.

25:22.444 --> 25:24.578
Guy's big. Could have been the muscle.

25:24.580 --> 25:30.450
That blood on his shirt
could be from the Vendls.

25:32.020 --> 25:36.423
Ok, I've got a Texas driver's license.

25:36.425 --> 25:37.724
Kevin Jones.

25:37.726 --> 25:42.262
Germ. Interesting nickname.

25:49.705 --> 25:53.139
Well, it's a recent photo.
Likely our gang.

25:53.141 --> 25:54.708
It's too bad their faces aren't clearer.

25:54.710 --> 25:57.377
Desk clerk says a guy
paid cash for the room,

25:57.379 --> 25:58.445
but it wasn't the victim.

25:58.447 --> 26:00.180
The others must have hid.

26:00.182 --> 26:03.250
She said she saw a green van
peel out of here around 1 a.m.

26:03.252 --> 26:05.185
Did the clerk get a make and model?

26:05.187 --> 26:06.453
Unfortunately not.

26:06.455 --> 26:08.121
She thought maybe mid-'70s,

26:08.123 --> 26:10.323
but she just didn't think
much of it at the time.

26:10.325 --> 26:11.825
Garcia.

26:11.827 --> 26:12.926
What's cracking, crime-fighters?

26:12.928 --> 26:14.227
We found a Texas driver's license

26:14.229 --> 26:15.629
of our latest victim,

26:15.631 --> 26:17.097
Kevin Jones,

26:17.099 --> 26:19.432
date of birth December 18, 1991.

26:19.434 --> 26:21.635
I texted it to you, but
it they wanted to keep low,

26:21.637 --> 26:22.902
it could be a fake.

26:22.904 --> 26:24.604
The word "Germ" is
branded on his wallet.

26:24.606 --> 26:26.006
It could be a nickname.

26:26.008 --> 26:28.875
Naughty, naughty. That I.D.'s a fake.

26:28.877 --> 26:31.411
Commencing facial recognition software

26:31.413 --> 26:33.513
for a definitive match.

26:38.153 --> 26:41.421
We're almost there. You want to cool it.

26:45.394 --> 26:49.095
Whoo! Yeah! Ha ha ha!

26:53.268 --> 26:55.356
Germ's real name is...

26:55.356 --> 26:57.071
Michael Sale.

26:57.071 --> 26:59.371
He is the second of 3 boys.

26:59.373 --> 27:01.574
He grew up in a small farming town

27:01.576 --> 27:02.808
outside of Dubuque.

27:02.810 --> 27:04.343
Really poor.

27:04.345 --> 27:06.445
His dad died when he was 16,

27:06.447 --> 27:09.415
then his mother drank
herself to death soon after.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.417
Those boys raised themselves.

27:11.419 --> 27:12.818
Oh, that's so hard.

27:12.820 --> 27:14.587
So of course they each got
in their own kind of trouble.

27:14.589 --> 27:17.423
Michael just barely
graduated high school,

27:17.425 --> 27:19.525
and then he went to work
in a local fast food joint.

27:19.527 --> 27:20.659
For how long?

27:20.661 --> 27:22.595
8 months. No job history after that.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.864
He did a brief stint in Texas

27:24.866 --> 27:27.032
for misdemeanor drug possession.

27:27.034 --> 27:30.669
Ex-con. Explains their
carefulness with their prints.

27:30.671 --> 27:32.238
Does he own a green van?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.373
Mm, no he does not.

27:34.375 --> 27:36.175
Search Michael's associates.

27:36.177 --> 27:38.344
Cross-check that with green van owners

27:38.346 --> 27:40.312
in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma,

27:40.314 --> 27:42.514
California, Texas, and New Mexico.

27:42.516 --> 27:45.751
Uh, make, model, and
year, please and thank you.

27:45.753 --> 27:49.255
Wishful thinking...
Van is roughly 40 years old.

27:49.257 --> 27:51.690
Then this is not gonna take a shovel,

27:51.692 --> 27:55.394
this is gonna take a backhoe.
Give me a steaming hot second.

28:07.942 --> 28:10.542
Where's Germ?

28:10.544 --> 28:13.545
I told you. He bolted.

28:13.547 --> 28:16.081
He didn't say where.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.896
He wouldn't leave and not tell me.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.998
Next house is yours, Kay.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.001
No screw-ups this time, you hear?

28:28.306 --> 28:30.773
Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas,

28:30.775 --> 28:33.492
California, New Mexico,
Oklahoma all coming up zilch

28:33.492 --> 28:35.915
regarding Michael/Germ and a green van.

28:36.781 --> 28:39.005
All right, try, uh,
Louisiana and Arkansas.

28:42.563 --> 28:44.600
Look at you, newbie McNewberson,

28:44.600 --> 28:46.491
with another good call.

28:46.491 --> 28:50.193
The aged green van belongs
to Ezekiel Reginald Daniels,

28:50.195 --> 28:52.462
28, born in Arkansas,

28:52.464 --> 28:53.996
never had a dad, mom was an addict,

28:53.998 --> 28:55.932
only child who was raised

28:55.934 --> 28:59.802
by variously abusive family members.

28:59.804 --> 29:02.738
Alvez, set up a city
and statewide APB on that van.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.173
Where'd they meet?

29:04.175 --> 29:06.442
Oh, you know, where people
meet people... in jail.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.411
Ok, Garcia, this may be a long throw,

29:08.413 --> 29:10.646
but are there any
similar robberies nearby

29:10.648 --> 29:13.053
dating back to immediately
after their release?

29:17.055 --> 29:20.056
Oh... That's not a long
throw at all, lovey.

29:20.058 --> 29:22.024
That's a very short and accurate toss.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.226
Good arm.

29:23.228 --> 29:27.463
I have them pegged
for a similar burglary

29:27.465 --> 29:30.666
late last year in Lawton, Oklahoma.

29:30.668 --> 29:32.978
And then another in Beaumont, Texas.

29:34.472 --> 29:37.773
And one after that in Newnan, Georgia.

29:37.775 --> 29:40.276
That's a suburb of Atlanta.
But that one was two weeks ago.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.711
They're experienced, like we thought.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.981
Crossing state lines
made their serial crimes

29:44.983 --> 29:46.148
appear as one-offs.

29:46.150 --> 29:47.390
Were any of them home invasions?

29:47.474 --> 29:50.114
No. They cleared the place up
before the owners arrived back home.

29:51.389 --> 29:53.956
I'll stay behind, wait
for the coroner to arrive.

29:53.958 --> 29:54.991
Thanks, Garcia.

30:03.935 --> 30:08.437
I just don't feel
right, not without Germ.

30:08.439 --> 30:11.374
He made his choice.

30:27.892 --> 30:29.425
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Adams.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.761
Did I leave my sweater here last week?

30:31.763 --> 30:34.030
I don't believe so, but if
you'd like to come in and...

30:34.032 --> 30:37.099
Aah!

30:42.874 --> 30:43.974
Uhh!

30:53.918 --> 30:55.919
Thanks, Prentiss.

30:57.121 --> 31:00.823
The unsubs were headed east
across Georgia two weeks ago

31:00.825 --> 31:04.060
but something triggered them to
change directions, heading west.

31:04.062 --> 31:06.395
Whatever the reason, that
likely affected the Alpha most.

31:06.397 --> 31:10.533
Problem is, our presumed
Alpha has no ties here.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.337
Nothing in his history
suggests he could lead a gang.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.238
And based on his precursor crime,

31:16.240 --> 31:18.774
it would have been difficult
to predict a sharp escalation

31:18.776 --> 31:20.376
to this level of violence.

31:20.378 --> 31:23.079
Then he was manipulated into it.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.548
In fact, he may not even realize it.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.516
And if he's not the Alpha,

31:27.518 --> 31:29.852
the next likely option is the muscle,

31:29.854 --> 31:31.821
but he's our latest victim,

31:31.823 --> 31:33.556
so it has to be one of the women.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.314
The question now is, which one?

31:36.761 --> 31:39.462
Uhh! Uhh!

31:40.515 --> 31:42.065
Stop it!

31:44.936 --> 31:46.469
Uhh!

31:47.271 --> 31:49.473
Ohh... Honey?

31:52.477 --> 31:53.843
Get over here.

31:55.279 --> 31:57.046
Come on!

32:00.184 --> 32:03.252
On your knees.

32:04.086 --> 32:05.154
Damn it.

32:05.156 --> 32:07.289
I'm in charge.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.096
You don't have the guts.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.432
Let's find out.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.835
Put it down.

32:19.837 --> 32:21.937
Now.

32:21.939 --> 32:23.272
No!

32:23.274 --> 32:26.242
You.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.946
Sorry.

32:30.948 --> 32:32.882
Things got out of control.

32:42.927 --> 32:44.061
Ohh!

32:49.767 --> 32:52.735
Girl's gotta know when to cut bait.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.382
Ohh!

33:06.384 --> 33:09.185
Mom...

33:09.187 --> 33:10.786
Dad.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.488
I'm home.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.076
Garcia, the real Alpha
is one of the women.

33:26.076 --> 33:27.743
She's from the area.
Probably comes from money.

33:27.745 --> 33:29.277
She's likely a user, which means

33:29.279 --> 33:31.913
she might have had and accidental
overdose or been injured.

33:31.915 --> 33:34.216
So start with hospital records, then.

33:34.418 --> 33:38.320
Last month, Ezekiel Daniels
was the emergency contact

33:38.322 --> 33:42.224
for a Bethany Elise
Adams, 21, from Escondido,

33:42.226 --> 33:45.494
which is another
wealthy San Diego suburb.

33:45.496 --> 33:48.897
Ok, so she spent the night in
a Jackson, Mississippi, hospital

33:48.899 --> 33:51.533
due to an accidental oxy overdose.

33:51.535 --> 33:54.936
And just 'cause a
girl's not been arrested

33:54.938 --> 33:56.605
don't mean she's never
gotten in trouble.

33:56.607 --> 33:58.774
This Bethany chick, she has pinballed

33:58.776 --> 34:01.409
all over the San Diego
prep school scene.

34:01.411 --> 34:03.411
I mean, from kindergarten
until 12th grade

34:03.413 --> 34:05.547
she was in 5 different schools.

34:05.549 --> 34:07.449
Expelled from each
one of them, I presume?

34:07.451 --> 34:10.918
Uh-huh. But each time she got expelled,

34:10.920 --> 34:14.422
she would consistently get
admitted into a new school

34:14.424 --> 34:17.324
because her parents would make
a hefty financial contribution

34:17.327 --> 34:18.226
to the new school.

34:18.228 --> 34:20.027
What are they like?

34:20.030 --> 34:24.065
They're maddeningly, maddeningly normal.

34:24.067 --> 34:27.101
And according all things
Michelle and Paul Adams,

34:27.103 --> 34:28.737
they're loving, indulgent parents.

34:28.739 --> 34:30.806
She has a younger sister Kendra,

34:30.808 --> 34:35.177
who works at the
family's real estate firm.

34:35.179 --> 34:37.779
Oh, sweet Christmas.

34:37.781 --> 34:40.248
Ok, the dad just recently updated

34:40.250 --> 34:41.882
his Facebook family picture.

34:41.885 --> 34:44.386
It's him, his wife,
and the daughter Kendra.

34:44.411 --> 34:46.275
No sign of Bethany, not even a shoutout.

34:46.989 --> 34:49.824
So Bethany's been cut
out of the perfect family.

34:49.827 --> 34:52.527
It explains why she attacked that photo.

34:52.529 --> 34:56.864
By and by, little sister was promoted
to junior assistant two weeks ago.

34:56.867 --> 34:58.266
Right before the first kill.

34:58.268 --> 34:59.434
So if this was all about the parents,

34:59.436 --> 35:01.269
why not go after them right away?

35:01.271 --> 35:02.771
Oh, I know. Because Mom and Dad

35:02.773 --> 35:03.972
have been away at a work conference.

35:03.974 --> 35:05.440
They arrived home early this morning.

35:05.442 --> 35:07.609
If Bethany knew that,
then she's already there.

35:07.611 --> 35:10.111
Ok, guys, you head over there,
I'll coordinate from here.

35:11.582 --> 35:13.849
We can still get out of this.

35:13.851 --> 35:16.284
You killed Zeke in self-defense.

35:16.286 --> 35:18.086
- It wasn't your fault.
- Bethany...

35:18.088 --> 35:20.121
- Shut up!
- Bea, sweetie...

35:20.123 --> 35:21.823
Shut up!

35:21.825 --> 35:23.225
You're done talking.

35:23.227 --> 35:25.393
Run.

35:26.496 --> 35:29.197
Aah!

35:29.199 --> 35:30.999
Drop it.

35:39.409 --> 35:42.143
You will not screw this up for me.

35:42.145 --> 35:43.511
Bea, stop!

35:43.513 --> 35:48.316
Shut up! Stop moving. Stop moving.

35:48.318 --> 35:52.187
Stop moving. Stop!

35:52.189 --> 35:53.955
Drop it.

35:53.957 --> 35:56.625
Oh, you little...

35:56.627 --> 35:58.326
Let her go.

35:58.328 --> 36:01.296
You will not screw this up!

36:11.541 --> 36:13.008
We'll take the side door.

36:13.010 --> 36:15.977
Have your men posted near the
front and go on our command.

36:17.114 --> 36:18.513
Go! Go, go, go, go!

36:18.515 --> 36:21.716
You get the front!
We'll move around back!

36:21.718 --> 36:23.952
All right, go on up.

36:32.129 --> 36:34.763
Bea, sweetheart...

36:34.765 --> 36:36.499
Shut up!

36:37.501 --> 36:40.268
Don't do it. Don't. Please don't.

36:42.339 --> 36:43.338
Please!

36:43.340 --> 36:45.607
What did my dad say?

36:45.609 --> 36:49.010
Please don't.

36:49.012 --> 36:52.280
Stop! You will not screw this up!

36:52.282 --> 36:54.649
Please let me go. Please.

36:54.651 --> 36:56.751
Bethany, please.

36:56.753 --> 36:57.619
Shut up!

36:57.621 --> 36:59.688
- Sweetie...
- Shut up!

36:59.690 --> 37:01.891
- Sweetie...
- Shut up!

37:02.946 --> 37:04.212
Drop the gun!

37:08.885 --> 37:10.485
On your back. On your back.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.124
All right, we need a medic now!

37:16.126 --> 37:17.859
Another one over here.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.427
Got a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

37:19.429 --> 37:21.664
We need two medics inside.

37:41.685 --> 37:45.286
Aah ha ha ha ha ha!

38:02.063 --> 38:04.505
Aaahhhh!

38:04.507 --> 38:05.740
Aaahhh!

38:11.715 --> 38:15.149
"A gang is where
a coward goes to hide."

38:15.151 --> 38:17.085
Mickey Mantle.

38:35.672 --> 38:38.139
You did great in San Diego.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.208
I'm glad you trusted your gut.

38:40.210 --> 38:42.043
Thank you for listening.

38:42.045 --> 38:44.279
I've been on teams where opinions,

38:44.281 --> 38:47.882
especially new ones,
aren't always valued.

38:49.235 --> 38:50.752
That's the nice thing about this group.

38:50.754 --> 38:54.413
Everybody has a voice.

38:54.891 --> 38:58.026
Anything new on Mr. Scratch?

38:58.028 --> 39:00.695
I got eyes and ears everywhere,

39:00.697 --> 39:01.930
but it's been quiet.

39:01.932 --> 39:05.433
That's not surprising, considering what
he's put us through recently.

39:05.435 --> 39:07.802
He waited over 20 years
to attack his first victims

39:07.804 --> 39:10.204
and another year-plus
to go after the team.

39:10.206 --> 39:11.973
The guy is patient.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.876
Smarter men than Scratch have
tried to take down this team before

39:14.878 --> 39:16.644
and they're all in prison.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.179
We're pretty good at this.

39:18.181 --> 39:20.248
I've noticed.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.451
Look, the fundamentals here
are similar to B.A.P.

39:23.453 --> 39:26.587
Recognize the patterns, find the mark,

39:26.589 --> 39:28.656
take 'em down, move on to the next one.

39:28.658 --> 39:31.159
And there's always a next one.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.729
Still, the BAU is a nice change of pace.

39:34.731 --> 39:38.099
But you don't miss all
that international travel.

39:38.101 --> 39:42.036
No, I don't.

39:42.038 --> 39:44.639
It's like in music.

39:44.641 --> 39:47.475
Sometimes you don't pick the instrument,

39:47.477 --> 39:50.478
the instrument picks you.

39:52.282 --> 39:53.982
Ok.

39:53.984 --> 39:56.651
I'll let you get back to it, then.
