WEBVTT

00:08.468 --> 00:12.334
Battalion 1-5 to Manhattan,
just arrived at tower one.

00:12.369 --> 00:15.500
Plane has just hit
the North Tower.

00:15.535 --> 00:18.500
Help me! Help me!

00:24.767 --> 00:26.167
God Almighty.

00:29.067 --> 00:31.900
Jerry, I need half of these guys
on the 77th floor,

00:31.935 --> 00:33.767
and the other half
on the 65th floor.

00:33.802 --> 00:35.901
Tommy, you take
your group, go up to 77.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.001
Lou, you grab your guys
and go up to 65.

00:39.001 --> 00:40.834
Watch out for the jumpers.

00:40.869 --> 00:42.732
Jesus.

00:42.767 --> 00:43.800
Be careful. All right. Go.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.301
Go. Be careful.

00:52.767 --> 00:53.899
Tommy!

00:53.934 --> 00:55.733
Give me a hand
with this guy.

00:55.768 --> 00:57.533
- Billy, hang on.
- Tommy! Tommy!

00:57.568 --> 00:58.498
Yeah?

00:58.533 --> 00:59.598
Yeah, chief?

00:59.633 --> 01:00.666
Take him out that door.

01:00.701 --> 01:01.700
Let's wait outside.

01:03.401 --> 01:04.800
Give me a hand over
here, brothers?

01:04.834 --> 01:06.018
You got it.
You got it?

01:06.053 --> 01:07.201
I got it.
I got it.

01:07.236 --> 01:08.867
I got it.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

01:20.533 --> 01:22.066
- Yeah?
- It's Jimmy.

01:22.101 --> 01:23.500
Where the hell
did you go, man?

01:23.535 --> 01:24.598
We're trapped up here.

01:24.633 --> 01:25.967
I'm coming.
Jimmy, I'm coming.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.266
Aw, shit!

01:27.301 --> 01:28.651
I'm coming right now.

01:28.686 --> 01:30.001
Jimmy!

01:35.067 --> 01:36.584
Move it, asshole!

01:36.619 --> 01:38.101
I got a life to live!

01:42.567 --> 01:44.167
Oh, you're some kind
of tough guy, huh?

01:44.202 --> 01:45.101
Aah!

01:47.533 --> 01:49.334
You got something you want
to say now, asshole?

01:49.369 --> 01:50.518
Ohh!

01:50.553 --> 01:51.632
Huh?

01:51.667 --> 01:54.633
I didn't think so.

01:57.533 --> 01:59.267
Jerk-off!

02:03.800 --> 02:05.600
See you later.

02:13.384 --> 02:16.594
INCHES

02:54.734 --> 02:56.333
No way. Really?

02:56.368 --> 02:59.034
Yeah. Well, eight and a teeny,
tiny smidgen of a bit more.

02:59.081 --> 03:00.589
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.941
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

03:03.001 --> 03:04.767
Eight and a smidgen
of what?

03:04.802 --> 03:05.832
What?

03:05.867 --> 03:07.767
Oh, the other night
I was watching TV.

03:07.802 --> 03:09.667
There was nothing on,
really, and I--

03:09.702 --> 03:11.166
Cut to the chase.

03:11.201 --> 03:12.884
Um, well, I got a hard-on,

03:12.919 --> 03:14.532
and I was looking at it

03:14.567 --> 03:15.967
and I was thinking
about jerking off--

03:16.002 --> 03:17.132
Would you cut to the chase?

03:17.167 --> 03:19.234
Well, there was a ruler
on the table, and--

03:19.269 --> 03:21.001
He measured his cock.

03:21.036 --> 03:22.518
You measured your cock?

03:22.553 --> 03:23.966
And it was eight inches?

03:24.001 --> 03:26.101
Mine was seven and
a half, almost.

03:26.136 --> 03:27.366
His was eight.

03:27.401 --> 03:28.900
Well,
eight and a titch.

03:28.935 --> 03:30.317
Hey. What's a titch?

03:30.352 --> 03:31.665
It's about this much.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.166
What are we talking about?

03:33.201 --> 03:34.633
They measured their Johnsons.

03:34.668 --> 03:35.699
- What?
- Yeah.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.334
The probie's got
seven and a half inches.

03:37.369 --> 03:39.018
Garrity's got eight
and a titch.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.610
You ever measure
your dick, Tommy?

03:40.645 --> 03:42.132
No.
You know, I get a hard-on,

03:42.167 --> 03:44.567
I'm usually too busy using it
for the good of all mankind.

03:44.602 --> 03:46.001
Lou?

03:46.036 --> 03:47.366
No.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.366
What's up?

03:48.401 --> 03:49.433
Hey, Frank,
what's up?

03:49.468 --> 03:50.600
Franco, how big is your dick?

03:52.368 --> 03:53.551
No, seriously.

03:53.586 --> 03:54.699
Uh, I don't know.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.867
I guess it's pretty normal size,
I guess.

03:56.902 --> 03:58.501
I mean exactly.

03:58.536 --> 04:00.066
I have no idea.

04:00.101 --> 04:01.498
So you never really measured it.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.101
Well, yeah. Maybe once
when I was a kid, probably.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.001
You two are severely retarded.

04:06.036 --> 04:06.966
Oh, come on.

04:07.001 --> 04:08.201
Probie said he
measured his cock,

04:08.236 --> 04:09.366
and I'd never done it
before,

04:09.401 --> 04:11.267
so he said he's seven
and a half inches.

04:11.302 --> 04:13.218
It made me
kind of curious.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.134
Turns out, eight and a titch.

04:15.169 --> 04:16.732
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

04:16.767 --> 04:17.899
It's pretty normal,
Frank.

04:17.934 --> 04:19.834
No, no, no. I mean,
Oh, my God. Like, wow.

04:19.869 --> 04:21.733
Those are seven and a half
and eight inches?

04:21.769 --> 04:22.699
Yeah.

04:22.734 --> 04:23.734
Eight and a titch.

04:23.769 --> 04:24.734
What's a titch?

04:24.769 --> 04:25.699
Tah-dee!

04:25.734 --> 04:27.399
It's kind of like that.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.034
Those are pretty big numbers,
so to speak.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.399
I was reading FHM the other day.

04:30.434 --> 04:32.633
They said that the average cock
is like six inches long.

04:32.668 --> 04:34.066
We're huge!

04:34.101 --> 04:35.151
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.598
Before you two ponies start swinging

04:36.646 --> 04:38.426
your Johnsons around,
answer one question for me.

04:38.468 --> 04:40.468
Did you measure from the top
or from the bottom?

04:40.503 --> 04:41.935
Ooh. A little fly
in the ointment.

04:41.970 --> 04:43.333
Did you go by the undercarriage,

04:43.368 --> 04:45.101
underneath the ball sac
out to the tip?

04:45.136 --> 04:47.765
Yeah, yeah. We did.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.166
Oh. Well, then,
you might as well

04:49.201 --> 04:50.765
been measuring
from the base of your spine,

04:50.800 --> 04:52.800
because everybody gets
at least an inch that way.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.800
You got to go
from the pubic bone to the tip.

04:54.835 --> 04:56.199
Oh, no way.

04:56.234 --> 04:57.834
That means I'm, like,
six and a half.

04:57.869 --> 04:59.032
- Almost.
- Shit.

04:59.067 --> 05:01.101
I don't know if you're
right about that, chief.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.485
Been there, done this, boys.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.799
Here. I got 20 that starts

05:03.834 --> 05:05.334
"the biggest dick
in the crew" contest.

05:05.369 --> 05:06.299
Who wants in?

05:06.334 --> 05:07.799
You gonna measure yours?

05:07.834 --> 05:09.434
I haven't seen my feet
in 10 years,

05:09.469 --> 05:10.718
not to mention my dick.

05:10.753 --> 05:11.932
Chief, I got a question.

05:11.967 --> 05:14.368
And I think I know what that
question is, Firefighter Gavin.

05:14.403 --> 05:15.667
- Really?
- Girth?

05:15.702 --> 05:17.099
Exactly.

05:17.134 --> 05:18.166
Wait. What?
Girth?

05:18.209 --> 05:20.278
- Circumference, asshole.
- Yeah.

05:20.308 --> 05:22.516
That's going to be
a completely different story.

05:22.568 --> 05:23.734
I'm going to double the wager.

05:23.769 --> 05:25.066
I'm with you.

05:25.101 --> 05:26.665
Then we measure
the length and the girth,

05:26.700 --> 05:28.767
and we combine it
into a mathematical equation

05:28.802 --> 05:30.051
that Billy will figure out.

05:30.086 --> 05:31.301
Wait. Who cares
about the--?

05:31.336 --> 05:32.318
Girth.

05:32.353 --> 05:33.266
Girth.

05:33.301 --> 05:34.550
Girtha Kitt.
Girth Brooks.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.776
King Kong versus
Girth.

05:35.811 --> 05:36.932
Hey, Billy, you want in

05:36.967 --> 05:38.567
on "the biggest dick
in the crew" contest?

05:38.602 --> 05:40.032
Not interested.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.783
Come on, it'll be
a lot of fun, Billy.

05:41.818 --> 05:43.500
It'll be a ball,
for crying out loud.

05:43.535 --> 05:44.934
I said no already,
goddamn it.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.434
What about you,
Franco?

05:46.469 --> 05:47.399
Yeah, I guess.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.434
What are you worried about?

05:48.469 --> 05:50.299
Well, losing.

05:50.334 --> 05:52.533
I don't think that this whole
measuring from the top thing

05:52.568 --> 05:54.099
is really right,
'cause who invented that?

05:54.134 --> 05:57.667
- You lose an inch, it's not fair.
- From the pubic bone to the tip,

05:57.702 --> 06:00.334
'cause that's all
that enters the vagina.

06:00.369 --> 06:02.967
From the pubic bone
out to the tip. Done.

06:05.368 --> 06:06.899
What?

06:06.934 --> 06:08.032
Nothing.
I just never thought

06:08.067 --> 06:09.401
I'd hear you say
the word "vagina."

06:12.434 --> 06:13.498
Vagina.

06:13.533 --> 06:15.832
- Stop.
- Va-gina.

06:15.867 --> 06:16.934
Come on, chief. Stop.

06:18.001 --> 06:18.966
Yeah?

06:19.001 --> 06:20.567
Can you get downers?

06:20.602 --> 06:21.532
Dad?

06:21.567 --> 06:22.532
I need some downers.

06:22.567 --> 06:23.567
Real good,
goddamn downers.

06:24.244 --> 06:25.658
What the hell is all
that screaming?

06:25.718 --> 06:26.996
Teddy brought
a monkey home.

06:27.034 --> 06:28.598
Where the hell
do you get a monkey?

06:28.633 --> 06:30.633
Him and this guy from down
in the Bronx Zoo...

06:31.633 --> 06:32.700
...bet the Yankees game.

06:32.735 --> 06:33.732
Get down
off that!

06:33.767 --> 06:35.565
Teddy won, and the guy's
strapped for cash.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.368
Now that goddamn thing
is shitting all over the place.

06:39.403 --> 06:40.967
Tried to bite me twice,
the little prick.

06:41.002 --> 06:42.232
Wow.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.533
I need to slip him something
so that he passes out,

06:44.568 --> 06:46.368
and I can get
some peace and quiet.

06:46.403 --> 06:47.732
Something strong.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.832
What about the monkey?

06:49.867 --> 06:51.767
- Well, I'll give it a smaller dose.
- Dad...

06:51.802 --> 06:53.199
Tommy...

06:53.234 --> 06:55.034
Look, why don't I just come
pick you up?

06:55.069 --> 06:56.251
Because I'm 72-years-old,

06:56.286 --> 06:57.434
and I'm supposed
to be able

06:57.469 --> 06:58.834
to take care of myself.

06:58.869 --> 06:59.865
Okay, okay. Okay.

06:59.898 --> 07:01.549
And don't tell anyone
about the monkey.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.072
Okay, okay.

07:04.434 --> 07:05.717
A monkey?

07:05.752 --> 07:07.001
What?

07:25.934 --> 07:27.101
Who the hell are you?

07:28.700 --> 07:30.500
Hey, hey, hey!

07:31.600 --> 07:33.600
Oh, my God.

07:33.635 --> 07:34.734
Jesus.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.099
Hello?

07:39.134 --> 07:40.934
I wanted to warn you
before you got home,

07:40.969 --> 07:42.734
but I got busy
with the kids.

07:42.769 --> 07:44.134
- Whose dog is it?
- What, now?

07:44.169 --> 07:45.500
What do you mean, "now"?

07:45.535 --> 07:46.600
Oh, he's humorous.

07:46.635 --> 07:47.899
Hey.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.734
Katy said that you said
that it was okay.

07:49.769 --> 07:50.699
I never said that.

07:50.734 --> 07:52.366
Anyway, he was only here
a half hour,

07:52.401 --> 07:54.201
and he's already chewed up
two pairs of shoes

07:54.236 --> 07:55.884
and pooped all over
the living-room rug.

07:55.919 --> 07:57.498
Well, I haven't checked
my closet yet,

07:57.533 --> 07:59.900
but I'm way ahead of schedule
in the shit department.

07:59.935 --> 08:02.334
Listen, the dog
is the least of our problems.

08:02.369 --> 08:04.734
Colleen got suspended today,
for, get this--

08:04.769 --> 08:06.035
making out in the hallway.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.301
That's against the rules now?

08:07.336 --> 08:09.651
With her girlfriend.

08:09.686 --> 08:11.659
Yes!

08:11.694 --> 08:13.264
Tom?

08:13.299 --> 08:14.799
Yeah?

08:14.834 --> 08:16.434
Well, did you hear
what I just said?

08:16.469 --> 08:17.399
Yeah.

08:17.434 --> 08:18.567
Doesn't that shock you?

08:18.602 --> 08:19.532
Yeah.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.233
I need you to come over here,

08:21.268 --> 08:22.900
because she won't listen
to me.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.166
No, no, no. I can't.

08:24.201 --> 08:26.600
I got that widows' dinner
tonight with Sheila.

08:26.635 --> 08:27.966
I'm a chaperone.

08:28.001 --> 08:30.834
Your daughter might be engaging
in lesbian activities.

08:30.869 --> 08:32.518
Honey, look on the bright side,
okay?

08:32.553 --> 08:34.131
Lesbians are big business
right now.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.567
If we teach her to golf,
we're way ahead of the game.

08:36.602 --> 08:39.267
Get over here now.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.734
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:02.234 --> 09:03.800
All right.

09:06.368 --> 09:08.434
Oh, yeah, daddy.

09:10.734 --> 09:11.767
Hey.

09:11.802 --> 09:12.800
Hey.

09:19.001 --> 09:22.366
So, um...

09:22.401 --> 09:25.134
your mother's telling me,
that, uh--

09:25.169 --> 09:26.934
Dad, I have
a girlfriend, okay?

09:26.969 --> 09:28.232
Like, what's
the big deal?

09:28.271 --> 09:30.093
I mean, you're the one
who always told us

09:30.114 --> 09:32.130
we could never judge people
by the color of their skin,

09:32.164 --> 09:34.094
not to jump to
conclusions about people,

09:34.167 --> 09:36.400
and how I can always come
and tell you anything

09:36.435 --> 09:38.633
because the one thing that
you wouldn't put up with

09:38.673 --> 09:40.924
was me lying or, like,
being dishonest, right?

09:40.993 --> 09:42.139
Yeah.

09:42.234 --> 09:44.099
So I'm being honest.

09:44.134 --> 09:45.299
Okay?
I have a girlfriend

09:45.334 --> 09:46.567
who I really,
really, really like

09:46.602 --> 09:47.765
and who's really, really smart.

09:47.802 --> 09:49.554
Getting in trouble
for kissing in the hallways

09:49.580 --> 09:51.658
when there are kids, like,
having sex in the stairwells.

09:51.689 --> 09:54.854
- It's a joke.
- It's a travesty.

09:54.969 --> 09:55.899
What?

09:55.934 --> 09:57.366
It's wrong.

09:57.401 --> 09:59.132
What, the "me having
a girlfriend" thing

09:59.167 --> 10:00.967
or the "kids having sex
in the hallways" thing?

10:01.002 --> 10:02.099
No, no, no.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.650
The whole, you know,
injustice thing.

10:04.685 --> 10:07.167
They shouldn't be
persecuting you.

10:07.202 --> 10:09.118
Really?

10:09.153 --> 10:10.999
Yeah.

10:11.034 --> 10:14.299
You should be free
to be who you are.

10:14.334 --> 10:16.650
That's why your grandparents
came to this country,

10:16.685 --> 10:18.967
so you could... be a lesbian
if you wanted to be.

10:19.002 --> 10:20.168
They did?

10:20.203 --> 10:21.299
Kinda.

10:21.334 --> 10:23.767
I mean, it was,
you know... Yeah.

10:23.802 --> 10:24.799
So you're not mad?

10:24.834 --> 10:26.500
No, no.
No, honey. No.

10:26.535 --> 10:28.501
Not at all.

10:28.536 --> 10:30.433
Oh, Daddy.

10:30.468 --> 10:32.468
Well, it's official.
She's gone lesbo.

10:32.503 --> 10:33.832
- What?
- Yeah.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.066
I'm sure it's just a phase.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.101
I mean, you know, you kissed
a couple of girls

10:37.142 --> 10:39.506
- in high school, right? So...
- No, I didn't.

10:39.536 --> 10:40.901
Oh, you didn't.

10:40.936 --> 10:42.232
I thought you did.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.266
I guess that was just
wishful thinking on my part.

10:44.301 --> 10:46.500
Anyways, we should have
stocked up on k.d. lang albums.

10:46.535 --> 10:48.534
By the way, I'm getting rid
of the dog.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.533
You can't.
Katy's in love with him.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.633
Oh! Jesus.

10:54.668 --> 10:56.184
Uh!

10:56.219 --> 10:57.700
Okay.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.366
Seven.

11:01.401 --> 11:03.565
Jesus. I lost a whole inch.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.533
This "measuring from the top"
shit sucks.

11:09.134 --> 11:10.199
Oh, yeah.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.401
You are much more my type,
sweetheart.

11:12.436 --> 11:13.532
Okay.

11:13.567 --> 11:14.966
Okay.

11:15.001 --> 11:18.533
Oh, God, yeah, baby!

11:18.568 --> 11:20.468
Yeah, baby!

11:22.767 --> 11:23.732
Oh, God!

11:23.767 --> 11:25.984
Look at the size
of that thing.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.201
It's gotta be
eight inches. Okay.

11:28.236 --> 11:29.818
Ha-ha! Ohh.

11:29.853 --> 11:31.401
Garrity?

11:38.234 --> 11:41.001
Hey, chief.

11:43.934 --> 11:44.932
Hello?

11:44.967 --> 11:46.234
Hey, uh, China,
it's Franco.

11:46.269 --> 11:47.199
How you doing, baby?

11:47.234 --> 11:48.700
Oh. Long time
no see, big boy.

11:48.735 --> 11:49.732
Yeah, yeah.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.366
Listen, I'm going to
cut to the chase.

11:51.401 --> 11:54.800
You remember that thing that
you, uh, wanted to put on my--?

11:54.835 --> 11:55.800
My thing that night?

11:55.835 --> 11:57.967
Oh, yes, I do.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.232
Yeah.

11:59.267 --> 12:01.267
Well, you said it'd let me
stay hard for what--

12:01.302 --> 12:02.668
For as long
as you keep it on.

12:02.703 --> 12:04.352
Yeah. That's what I thought.

12:04.387 --> 12:05.966
Hey, listen,
you busy tonight?

12:06.001 --> 12:07.600
No, I'm never too busy
for you, baby.

12:07.635 --> 12:08.934
That's what I like to hear.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.784
Sheil?

12:13.819 --> 12:16.301
You ready?

12:16.336 --> 12:17.498
Hey.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.400
What's wrong?

12:19.435 --> 12:21.267
Mmm. Mmm.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.767
Damian's dealing drugs.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.401
What?

12:26.436 --> 12:27.966
Mmm. Mmm.

12:28.001 --> 12:29.132
I like this game.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.800
What do I have to do
to win?

12:30.835 --> 12:32.001
I'm not kidding.

12:34.301 --> 12:35.633
Holy shit.

12:38.368 --> 12:39.799
Oh, my God.

12:39.834 --> 12:40.999
He's upstairs.
I can hear him.

12:41.034 --> 12:42.734
He's tearing his room apart
right now.

12:42.769 --> 12:44.001
I'll go talk to him.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.667
Looking for something, asshole?

13:00.702 --> 13:02.465
Those aren't mine.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.533
Yeah, that's gonna fly.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.765
If your dad was here right now,

13:07.800 --> 13:10.334
you wouldn't see your
next goddamn birthday, okay?

13:10.369 --> 13:11.434
This stops here.

13:11.469 --> 13:13.734
Fine.

13:16.468 --> 13:17.934
Is this everything?

13:17.969 --> 13:19.118
Yep.

13:19.153 --> 13:20.232
Really?

13:20.267 --> 13:23.368
I'll tear this goddamn room
apart right now.

13:26.067 --> 13:29.034
Hold on.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.966
There.

13:32.001 --> 13:33.567
Anything else?

13:40.900 --> 13:41.865
That's everything.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.465
What are you
going to do with it?

13:43.500 --> 13:46.001
Oh, I'm opening a little
pharmacy on my front lawn.

13:46.036 --> 13:47.600
What do you think
I'm going to do?

13:47.635 --> 13:49.099
I'm confiscating it, okay?

13:49.221 --> 13:50.669
You're lucky your dad
ain't alive,

13:50.759 --> 13:52.568
'cause I'll tell you what...

13:56.167 --> 13:57.917
Let me ask you something.

13:57.952 --> 13:59.667
Any of these things downers?

13:59.702 --> 14:00.899
Why?

14:00.934 --> 14:02.734
What do you mean why?
Just answer the question.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.434
Yeah. The roofies.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.700
These ones?

14:06.735 --> 14:07.665
Okay.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.767
What about these?

14:08.802 --> 14:09.799
This is Ketamine.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.167
It's an animal tranquilizer.

14:11.202 --> 14:12.384
What about these?

14:12.419 --> 14:13.509
Those are Adderall.

14:13.544 --> 14:14.565
What does that do?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
Well, they speed things up.

14:15.635 --> 14:17.051
Okay.

14:17.086 --> 14:18.433
Cool.

14:18.468 --> 14:20.401
All right. Thanks, man.

14:22.101 --> 14:23.900
By the way, I catch you
a second time,

14:23.935 --> 14:25.800
I call the cops,
you little shit.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.201
This... This ain't the way
to the hall.

14:32.236 --> 14:33.565
I know.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.001
I gotta make a quick stop
at my Uncle Teddy's house.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.950
Okay, let's put it
on now.

14:38.983 --> 14:42.011
Hey, you know, what, baby,
let's just forget about the contest.

14:42.069 --> 14:43.132
I'm enjoying this too much.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.401
No, no. I kind of want
to know myself now

14:45.436 --> 14:47.667
just how big it is.

14:47.702 --> 14:49.401
All right.

14:49.436 --> 14:50.366
Ow.

14:50.401 --> 14:52.468
It's a little snug.

14:52.503 --> 14:54.099
Ow!

14:54.134 --> 14:55.434
Almost there.

14:55.469 --> 14:56.734
Aah!

14:58.434 --> 15:00.900
Don't go in
there, I gotta use that!

15:03.201 --> 15:04.498
Sheila!

15:04.533 --> 15:06.468
Sheila, come in.
Come in, come in.

15:07.468 --> 15:08.632
Come in.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.600
You filthy little
son of a bitch!

15:10.635 --> 15:11.765
You keep screaming,

15:11.800 --> 15:13.967
I'll stick a banana
right up your ass!

15:14.002 --> 15:15.433
Sheil!

15:15.468 --> 15:16.667
Come here, give me a hug!

15:16.702 --> 15:18.799
Hi, Uncle Teddy.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.434
I'm gonna talk to my dad
for a second in the kitchen.

15:21.469 --> 15:23.032
Yeah, sure.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.765
Boy, you look great!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.733
You see what I'm
talking about?

15:27.768 --> 15:29.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I brought help.

15:29.702 --> 15:30.718
Here you go.

15:30.753 --> 15:31.734
Ooh. Oh, shit.

15:31.769 --> 15:33.199
Yeah.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.433
These are called roofies.
They're like a date-rape drug.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.633
Give him a couple of those,
it should knock him right out.

15:37.668 --> 15:39.066
What's this?

15:39.101 --> 15:41.334
That's an animal tranquilizer.

15:41.369 --> 15:42.865
Is that for the monkey?

15:42.900 --> 15:45.167
I guess it'd work on
the monkey too, yeah.

15:47.334 --> 15:48.784
Oh, my God.

15:48.819 --> 15:50.199
Franco...

15:50.234 --> 15:51.533
Almost five inches.

15:51.568 --> 15:53.665
Is that good?

15:53.700 --> 15:55.532
Five inches around.

15:55.567 --> 15:57.800
Most guys are lucky
to be that long.

15:57.835 --> 15:59.899
Wow.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.134
Well, let's check
the length on that

16:02.169 --> 16:03.318
and then get this thing off.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.468
It's feeling kind of bizarre.

16:04.503 --> 16:07.001
Okay. Hang on.

16:07.036 --> 16:09.465
Bullshit contest.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.800
Instead of guys
being so concerned

16:10.835 --> 16:11.999
about the size of their penis,

16:12.034 --> 16:13.934
they should just
check their ego at the door

16:13.969 --> 16:15.834
and learn how to use
whatever God gave them.

16:15.869 --> 16:17.533
You know?

16:19.567 --> 16:21.001
What? What's wrong?

16:21.036 --> 16:22.401
Nine inches.

16:22.436 --> 16:23.851
What?

16:23.886 --> 16:25.232
Yeah.

16:25.267 --> 16:26.567
I knew it was big, but...

16:26.602 --> 16:27.834
Nine inches?

16:27.869 --> 16:29.301
Yeah.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.699
Yeah!

16:30.734 --> 16:32.967
That's what
I'm talking about, baby!

16:33.002 --> 16:35.418
Ha ha!

16:35.453 --> 16:37.799
What?

16:37.834 --> 16:38.966
Oh, I know.

16:39.001 --> 16:42.034
Thank you so much.
Okay, thanks.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.765
Sheila, Tommy!

16:43.800 --> 16:45.050
- Hi! How are you?
- Hi!

16:45.085 --> 16:46.266
Good. How are you?

16:46.301 --> 16:47.633
- Great, great.
- Hey, how are you?

16:47.668 --> 16:48.633
How are you doing?

16:48.668 --> 16:49.699
Good.

16:49.734 --> 16:51.484
Honey, you so deserve this trip.

16:51.519 --> 16:53.199
That's what
Bobby's mother said.

16:53.234 --> 16:55.500
It's you and your mom
and the kids, right?

16:55.535 --> 16:56.865
Family cruise, how perfect is that?

16:56.900 --> 16:59.067
I know, I know.
I really got to get away.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.151
I know.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.166
Tommy.

17:01.201 --> 17:02.934
Hey, Gloria,
how are you?

17:02.969 --> 17:04.101
I'm good.

17:04.136 --> 17:05.351
Gloria.

17:05.386 --> 17:06.531
Sheil.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.700
Um, I'm going to go say hi
to Maddie's mom.

17:08.734 --> 17:10.834
Uh, you know what?
I checked with the kitchen,

17:10.868 --> 17:12.434
and the food'll be out
in 15 minutes.

17:12.469 --> 17:14.898
Oh, thanks, Glo.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.201
You want to get a drink?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.001
Yeah.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.732
Sure.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.300
So, uh, how you doing?

17:21.335 --> 17:22.834
Good.
I'm pretty good.

17:22.868 --> 17:23.932
How you feeling?

17:23.967 --> 17:26.367
Surrounded by sad
bereaved ladies?

17:26.403 --> 17:27.333
I don't know.

17:27.367 --> 17:28.767
I think everybody
seems to be having

17:28.802 --> 17:29.732
a pretty good time.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.234
Yeah?
Do you like sad ladies?

17:31.269 --> 17:32.565
Huh?

17:32.600 --> 17:35.233
- Double vodka on the rocks.
- For you, sir?

17:35.268 --> 17:37.867
I'll have just a water,
please. Thanks.

17:37.902 --> 17:39.201
Word has it
you're seeing Sheila.

17:39.236 --> 17:40.134
What?

17:41.201 --> 17:44.001
I'm here as a--
As a chaperone.

17:44.036 --> 17:45.266
Okay? Official business.

17:45.301 --> 17:47.468
It's okay if you're seeing her.

17:47.503 --> 17:49.266
Do you want to see her?

17:49.301 --> 17:50.700
Glo, she was married
to my cousin.

17:50.735 --> 17:52.900
I know.
Answer the question.

17:52.935 --> 17:54.368
No.

17:57.567 --> 17:58.650
P-pull harder.

17:58.685 --> 17:59.699
It's stuck!

17:59.734 --> 18:01.468
What?
No, it can't be stuck.

18:01.503 --> 18:02.532
Look, I don't know.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.950
We tried water, butter--

18:04.985 --> 18:07.126
No. No more butter.
Okay?

18:07.161 --> 18:09.267
I don't know what else to do.

18:09.302 --> 18:10.966
Okay. Okay. Um...

18:11.001 --> 18:13.484
We're just going
to have to wait, okay?

18:13.519 --> 18:16.243
Until it, uh...
Until it goes away.

18:16.278 --> 18:18.967
Well, it's not going
to go away, baby.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.368
The blood is trapped
inside of your penis...

18:23.403 --> 18:27.067
your very big and inviting--

18:27.102 --> 18:28.434
Hey, stop.

18:28.469 --> 18:29.732
Come on, baby.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.667
Not now, China. Okay?

18:34.667 --> 18:36.468
Well, then we're going
to have to call 911.

18:36.503 --> 18:38.632
What? No. No, no.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.101
You got any better ideas?

18:43.167 --> 18:44.983
You know what?
Give me that phone.

18:45.018 --> 18:46.800
Listen to me, Tommy.
I'm a widow.

18:46.835 --> 18:47.865
I'm sad, I'm lonely,

18:47.903 --> 18:49.160
I'm in need
of some carnal bliss.

18:49.183 --> 18:51.025
You're a good-looking guy
with a shitty marriage,

18:51.069 --> 18:52.318
plus you're
a chaperone.

18:52.353 --> 18:53.532
You should be
all over me.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.966
Look, Gloria,
the chaperone thing

18:55.001 --> 18:56.633
is pretty much, you know,
an official position.

18:56.668 --> 18:57.966
It's an honorary thing.
I don't--

18:58.001 --> 18:59.967
Make me feel like
I'm 17 again, Tommy.

19:00.002 --> 19:01.284
What?

19:01.319 --> 19:02.532
Take me.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.001
Take me home and have me.

19:04.036 --> 19:06.001
- Gloria--
- Tommy.

19:06.036 --> 19:06.966
Glo.

19:07.001 --> 19:08.900
Tommy.

19:13.134 --> 19:15.032
Well?

19:15.067 --> 19:17.067
I gotta go.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.134
Yeah.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.167
Here.

19:24.167 --> 19:25.132
What?

19:25.167 --> 19:26.767
Hey, uh, Lou...

19:26.802 --> 19:28.333
it's Franco.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.434
Yeah, what's going on?
You sound all fartootst.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.498
Uh, yeah.

19:31.533 --> 19:32.917
Listen, buddy.

19:32.952 --> 19:34.301
I need a favor.

19:37.101 --> 19:38.434
Hi. We got to go.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.399
Mm-mm-mm.

19:39.434 --> 19:41.333
We're having
a good time.

19:41.368 --> 19:42.967
You can get a ride
from Maddie, right?

19:43.002 --> 19:43.966
Yeah.

19:44.001 --> 19:45.134
All right.
I'll see you later.

19:46.401 --> 19:47.334
Okay...

19:51.368 --> 19:53.950
Hey, Franco,
remember that time

19:53.985 --> 19:56.533
we found that
big, fat black broad

19:56.568 --> 19:57.498
handcuffed to the bed

19:57.533 --> 19:59.250
up at the fire
on 127th Street?

19:59.285 --> 20:00.967
Yeah. Those were
her wrists.

20:01.002 --> 20:02.567
This is my dick, Lou.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.899
Yeah.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.633
Your, uh...

20:06.800 --> 20:10.066
Your apparently
contest-winning dick, Franco.

20:10.101 --> 20:11.899
I'm gonna need something
non-flammable on top here.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.233
This thing's going to give off
a lot of heat and friction.

20:14.268 --> 20:16.533
I don't want to have any
scarring or burning or, uh...

20:16.718 --> 20:18.768
I'm just gonna stop talking now,
Franco, okay?

20:18.949 --> 20:20.245
Be a man.

20:26.001 --> 20:27.166
Yeah?

20:27.201 --> 20:29.001
What kind of pills
did you give me?

20:29.036 --> 20:30.699
Why?

20:30.734 --> 20:33.551
He's been talking all night
and dancing.

20:33.586 --> 20:36.076
He called up
and ordered five escort girls.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.567
He's high as a kite
and ready to go all night.

20:38.602 --> 20:40.498
What about the monkey?

20:40.533 --> 20:43.600
Well, his heart's racing
a mile a minute

20:43.635 --> 20:46.632
and, uh... I've been
giving him shooters.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.167
Shit, I must have grabbed the
uppers instead of the downers.

20:49.202 --> 20:50.132
You know what?

20:50.167 --> 20:52.100
Go to the animal tranqs.

20:52.135 --> 20:53.951
Should I double
the dose?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.767
Yeah, and then
call me back.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.800
Franco, stop flinching!

21:00.835 --> 21:02.099
I'm trying, Lou!

21:02.134 --> 21:04.201
Hey, look, you've already
been circumcised once.

21:04.236 --> 21:05.918
I don't want to do it again.

21:05.953 --> 21:07.600
Oh, it burns!
Oh, yeah!

21:07.635 --> 21:08.600
Oh, God! Aah! Aah!

21:08.635 --> 21:09.533
We're good.

22:09.734 --> 22:11.767
I don't want to
catch on fire again.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.734
Hey, Tom.

22:31.769 --> 22:32.899
Hey.

22:32.934 --> 22:33.934
What are you doing?

22:33.969 --> 22:35.451
Nothing. Um...

22:35.486 --> 22:36.899
Just, uh...

22:36.934 --> 22:40.201
You know, lighting
a couple of candles.

22:40.236 --> 22:42.201
Saying a prayer.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.167
Oh, yeah. For who?

22:44.202 --> 22:45.984
Uh...

22:46.019 --> 22:47.732
Nobody.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.434
You know, just...

22:50.434 --> 22:52.199
You know, we...

22:52.234 --> 22:53.317
For better or for worse,

22:53.352 --> 22:54.366
we got security cameras

22:54.401 --> 22:56.734
all over the doors
and entrances.

22:56.769 --> 22:57.899
Drunks, vandals, whatever.

22:57.934 --> 23:00.700
I know for a fact
you've been in here

23:00.735 --> 23:02.134
four times
this past month.

23:02.169 --> 23:03.333
So, what's up?

23:03.368 --> 23:05.434
You a big believer in God again?

23:05.469 --> 23:07.532
No.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.767
I didn't think so.
So what is it?

23:09.802 --> 23:13.799
I, uh...

23:13.834 --> 23:17.601
I think I believe
in the candles.

23:17.636 --> 23:21.333
You know, the whole
David Blaine,

23:21.368 --> 23:26.633
David Copperfield aspect
of being a Catholic.

23:26.668 --> 23:27.598
Ahh.

23:27.633 --> 23:29.066
Fill me in.

23:29.101 --> 23:31.900
The Resurrection,
the Immaculate Conception,

23:31.935 --> 23:35.266
the whole "walking
on water" thing,

23:35.301 --> 23:37.500
the... thing where Jesus
feeds 10,000 people

23:37.535 --> 23:40.334
with one loaf of bread
and the fish.

23:40.369 --> 23:41.699
You know, when I was a kid,

23:41.734 --> 23:43.934
that magic stuff used to make me
laugh my ass off,

23:43.969 --> 23:46.134
but now I think I get it,
you know, I think...

23:48.034 --> 23:51.799
God makes things disappear.

23:51.834 --> 23:56.533
Sometimes it's honest,
decent, hard-working people,

23:56.568 --> 23:59.234
and sometimes it's ghosts.

23:59.269 --> 24:01.900
Now, I think God,
uh...

24:03.800 --> 24:04.934
...led me here.

24:10.301 --> 24:11.751
You all right?

24:11.786 --> 24:13.201
You got a cat?

24:13.236 --> 24:14.266
Yeah.

24:14.301 --> 24:15.900
Strays wander in every
once in a while.

24:15.935 --> 24:16.865
Why?

24:16.900 --> 24:17.834
Oh, nothing.

24:19.267 --> 24:20.399
All right.

24:20.434 --> 24:22.500
Well, I got to get going.

24:24.368 --> 24:25.633
See you around.

24:25.668 --> 24:27.217
Yeah.

24:27.252 --> 24:28.767
Hey.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.000
Call me.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.500
Yeah.

24:38.234 --> 24:40.034
Um... horse whisperer.

24:40.069 --> 24:41.333
No.

24:41.368 --> 24:42.832
Long Dong Silver!

24:42.867 --> 24:44.467
Now, off with the robe!

24:46.102 --> 24:47.532
Whoa!

24:47.567 --> 24:48.699
How you feeling, Ted?

24:48.734 --> 24:51.134
I'm kicking her ass
in strip charades.

24:51.169 --> 24:52.451
I'm drunk, I'm high.

24:52.486 --> 24:53.699
I've never felt better.

24:53.734 --> 24:55.267
You ought to worry
about that monkey.

24:55.302 --> 24:56.800
I haven't heard
a peep out of him

24:56.835 --> 25:00.067
in a half an hour.

25:00.102 --> 25:02.299
Okay.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.465
Um... a movie.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

25:10.800 --> 25:14.900
You still in here,
you little crazy bastard?

25:37.301 --> 25:38.366
Teddy?

25:38.401 --> 25:39.801
Oh, is he all right?

25:39.836 --> 25:41.068
Is he breathing?

25:41.103 --> 25:42.266
I don't know.

25:42.301 --> 25:44.900
Oh, my God.
Do you think he's dead?

25:44.935 --> 25:45.865
Nah.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.765
He just finally
hit the wall.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.800
I'm pretty sure
the monkey's dead, though.

25:53.134 --> 25:56.867
When he comes to,
tell him I took his car.

26:04.767 --> 26:06.867
Nothing on the girth, huh, Sean?

26:06.902 --> 26:08.433
Uh... no.

26:08.468 --> 26:09.832
Yeah, this sucks.

26:09.867 --> 26:12.067
It's all about the girth,
my friend.

26:12.102 --> 26:13.565
There you go.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.334
Wow. Big numbers on
a small piece of paper.

26:16.369 --> 26:18.532
Probie, girth,
two and a half.

26:18.567 --> 26:20.667
I got magic markers
bigger than that.

26:20.702 --> 26:22.551
Well, maybe
I was doing it wrong.

26:22.586 --> 26:24.401
Circumference.
All the way around.

26:24.436 --> 26:26.232
No. I did it right.

26:26.267 --> 26:27.734
Licorice stick.

26:29.767 --> 26:30.732
Hey, Franco!

26:30.767 --> 26:32.401
You got some
winning numbers for me?

26:32.436 --> 26:33.399
Uh, yeah.

26:33.434 --> 26:35.834
Length, nine.
Girth, four and a half.

26:37.401 --> 26:39.101
Oh, uh, four and three quarters.

26:39.136 --> 26:40.468
What was that?

26:40.503 --> 26:41.765
Long story.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.600
Or wide, actually,
depending on how you look it.

26:44.635 --> 26:45.600
Who wants a dog?

26:46.600 --> 26:47.565
A dog?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.066
Like a pet dog?

26:49.101 --> 26:51.633
No. A hotdog, asshole.

26:54.301 --> 26:55.967
Battalion 1-5 to Manhattan.

26:56.002 --> 26:57.598
Transmit a second alarm.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.401
I'm going to need
an additional engine.

27:01.301 --> 27:02.700
Tommy, get up to that
second floor,

27:02.735 --> 27:03.665
the northeast exposure.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.101
I think the squat
is up there.

27:05.136 --> 27:06.399
Lou, be careful.

27:06.434 --> 27:09.099
This thing's going to
light up like a matchbox.

27:09.134 --> 27:11.267
Battalion 1-5 to Manhattan,
transmit a second alarm.

27:18.401 --> 27:21.067
Gimme a tap.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.134
All right. Move back.

27:29.633 --> 27:30.700
All right. Stay close.

27:30.735 --> 27:31.900
Okay.

27:35.967 --> 27:36.933
Ready?

27:36.968 --> 27:37.900
Yeah.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.967
Stay close.

27:51.001 --> 27:52.567
Tommy!

27:53.967 --> 27:54.900
Tommy!

27:55.900 --> 27:57.167
Tommy!

27:57.202 --> 27:58.434
Tommy!

28:36.734 --> 28:39.017
Second floor.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.301
Ladies' lingerie.

28:45.234 --> 28:46.950
Tommy!

28:47.211 --> 28:49.351
- Tommy!
- Probie, what's up?

28:49.502 --> 28:51.058
The ceiling collapsed.
Tommy's in there!

28:51.102 --> 28:52.667
We got to get to him!
He's trapped!

28:52.702 --> 28:53.951
Come on.
I know another way.

28:53.994 --> 28:55.541
- Further down the hallway.
- Tommy!

28:55.601 --> 28:57.591
I know this building.
Come on. Come with me.

29:00.700 --> 29:01.633
Shit.

29:21.867 --> 29:24.234
Goddamn it, where's the door?

29:32.468 --> 29:33.667
- Tommy!
- Hey.

29:33.702 --> 29:34.818
Tommy!

29:34.853 --> 29:35.899
Tommy!

29:35.934 --> 29:36.950
We're going in.

29:36.985 --> 29:37.932
I'm over here.

29:37.967 --> 29:39.134
Over here, Tommy.
Over here.

29:39.169 --> 29:40.099
Tommy!

29:40.134 --> 29:41.099
What do you got?

29:41.134 --> 29:42.134
It's a girl
squatter.

29:42.169 --> 29:43.285
Probie, come on!

29:43.320 --> 29:44.366
You got her?

29:44.401 --> 29:46.001
Yeah, we got her,
Tommy.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.032
Grab the wrist.

29:47.067 --> 29:48.301
We got a window
over here.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.600
All right,
now drag her out.

29:55.635 --> 29:58.032
Get her, get her.

29:58.067 --> 30:00.934
Michael, I got a 10-45
coming to the window.

30:00.969 --> 30:02.333
Move her, move her.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.868
Tommy, I'm going to do
a quick sweep.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.368
Be careful. It's
shit in there, man.

30:05.403 --> 30:06.368
Stay around the edges.

30:06.403 --> 30:07.333
I got it, Tom.

30:07.368 --> 30:08.333
It's going to be fine.

30:08.368 --> 30:09.834
Come on, asshole.
Hurry up.

30:09.869 --> 30:12.034
Let's get out of here.

30:12.069 --> 30:13.268
Billy!

30:13.303 --> 30:14.468
Down!

30:16.167 --> 30:17.633
Get ready to move that line in.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.217
Tommy and Billy
are still in here.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.034
Well, let's get her
out first, kid.

30:25.667 --> 30:26.633
Billy!

30:29.167 --> 30:30.333
Billy!

30:30.368 --> 30:31.465
I'm here.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.200
Hey, what do you got?

30:33.235 --> 30:34.900
Hold on,
I got someone.

30:34.935 --> 30:35.932
Hurry up!

30:35.967 --> 30:36.900
Careful, careful.

30:37.867 --> 30:40.333
Just take her.

30:40.368 --> 30:41.368
- I got her.
- All right.

30:41.403 --> 30:42.352
I got her.

30:42.387 --> 30:43.301
All right.

30:48.034 --> 30:49.034
All right, all right.

30:53.401 --> 30:54.801
Billy!

30:54.836 --> 30:56.166
Bill!

30:56.201 --> 30:58.734
Billy! Shit!

31:01.500 --> 31:02.516
Hey, somebody
grab her.

31:02.551 --> 31:03.675
Hey, did Billy come out?

31:03.710 --> 31:04.765
No, he was with you.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.800
The floor collapsed.
He dropped right in front of me.

31:06.835 --> 31:07.865
Mayday, mayday!

31:07.900 --> 31:10.001
Battalion 1-5, everybody
stay off the air!

33:34.734 --> 33:39.067
We all knew Billy Warren
as a firefighter's firefighter.

33:39.102 --> 33:41.434
He knew every building
in this district

33:41.469 --> 33:43.901
like the back of his hand.

33:43.936 --> 33:46.299
He was a brave, brave man.

33:46.334 --> 33:49.399
Now, Billy
left specific instructions

33:49.434 --> 33:53.217
if he should be killed
in the line of duty.

33:53.252 --> 33:57.001
He didn't want a large
funeral mass or burial.

33:57.036 --> 34:01.834
He also wanted his ex-wife
to come...

34:01.869 --> 34:03.134
and speak in his memory.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.665
Hello.
My name is Sandra Warren.

34:12.699 --> 34:15.567
Billy and I were only married
for six weeks

34:15.601 --> 34:17.418
about five years ago,

34:17.453 --> 34:19.199
because I discovered

34:19.234 --> 34:20.699
that three weeks
into our marriage,

34:20.734 --> 34:23.900
he was having an affair
with his old girlfriend, Mary.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.399
Mary?

34:26.434 --> 34:28.483
Oh. There she is.

34:28.518 --> 34:30.533
Stand up, Mare.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.099
Go ahead.

34:32.134 --> 34:35.101
You see, Billy
didn't really love me,

34:35.136 --> 34:36.399
or Mary.

34:36.434 --> 34:39.032
He loved you guys.

34:39.067 --> 34:41.667
Oh, I heard these names a lot--

34:41.702 --> 34:47.067
Tommy, Jerry, Lou, Franco.

34:47.101 --> 34:51.299
Stand up, guys.

34:51.333 --> 34:55.266
Well, it's nice to connect
the names to the faces.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.899
A lot of you guys
would never admit

34:57.934 --> 35:01.034
that you feel closer
to the guys in the firehouse

35:01.069 --> 35:04.934
than you do
to your own wives or kids.

35:04.969 --> 35:08.418
We all see you
as heroic and brave,

35:08.453 --> 35:11.867
as if you were not mere mortals,

35:11.902 --> 35:14.532
but that's what you are.

35:14.567 --> 35:16.834
When someone sets fire to you,

35:16.869 --> 35:18.166
you burn the same way

35:18.201 --> 35:20.001
that the people
you're trying to save do.

35:20.036 --> 35:22.535
And if you choose
to get married,

35:22.570 --> 35:25.034
and you choose
to start a family,

35:25.069 --> 35:29.066
you owe us something too.

35:29.101 --> 35:30.732
And I'm not going to miss him,

35:30.767 --> 35:32.834
because I wrote Billy
out of my life

35:32.869 --> 35:33.799
the day I found out

35:33.834 --> 35:36.334
he was still seeing Mary
behind my back.

35:36.369 --> 35:38.700
Thank you.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.166
Thanks, kid.

35:46.201 --> 35:47.334
Here you go, boys.

35:47.369 --> 35:48.468
Thanks, chief.

35:48.503 --> 35:50.932
To Billy.

35:50.967 --> 35:52.167
You know what?
Never mind that.

35:52.202 --> 35:53.532
How about these two broads?

35:53.567 --> 35:56.517
I mean, they're both a 12
on a scale from one to 10.

35:56.546 --> 35:58.471
- Tommy, can I talk to you for a second?
- What's up?

35:58.623 --> 36:00.312
There's a rumor
going around

36:00.372 --> 36:02.095
that you've been doing
some widow-banging.

36:02.169 --> 36:03.166
- What?
- Yeah.

36:03.201 --> 36:04.565
That you took some chick
named Gloria

36:04.600 --> 36:06.201
home from the widows'
ball the other night,

36:06.236 --> 36:07.166
Captain Chaperone?

36:07.201 --> 36:09.001
No. No.
Absolute bullshit.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.797
Okay.
Listen, Tommy, I'm not trying

36:10.863 --> 36:13.348
to get in your personal business,
but you better watch your ass.

36:13.401 --> 36:15.434
The wives are talking,
the widows are talking.

36:15.469 --> 36:17.468
Worst of all, a lot of guys
see widow-banging

36:17.503 --> 36:18.900
as a breach of
certain unwritten rules.

36:18.935 --> 36:20.834
- I know, I know.
- Hey, want a drink?

36:20.869 --> 36:22.767
Yeah. Uh, no, no.

36:24.234 --> 36:25.799
So...

36:25.834 --> 36:27.334
that whole thing with Gloria
was bullshit?

36:27.369 --> 36:29.832
She's nuts.

36:29.867 --> 36:31.617
What about the drinking thing?

36:31.652 --> 36:33.333
What? I put
two and two together.

36:33.368 --> 36:35.567
The boys in the crew don't know
that you quit drinking?

36:35.602 --> 36:38.732
I quit drinking
in front of family

36:38.767 --> 36:40.567
so that Janet would think
I really quit drinking

36:40.602 --> 36:42.368
so that she'd get back
together again with me,

36:42.403 --> 36:43.885
but I didn't tell
the guys at work

36:43.920 --> 36:45.368
because I didn't want
them to think

36:45.403 --> 36:46.767
it was like
a sign of weakness

36:46.802 --> 36:47.832
or that I, you know,

36:47.867 --> 36:49.468
I was having some kind
of sudden change

36:49.503 --> 36:50.498
like I was losing it.

36:50.533 --> 36:51.967
Plus, it allowed me
to keep drinking

36:52.002 --> 36:53.967
while I was going
to AA.

36:54.002 --> 36:55.434
To fool Janet.

36:55.469 --> 36:56.399
Ohh.

36:56.434 --> 36:57.966
Yeah, but the thing is

36:58.001 --> 36:59.201
I really haven't had
a drink

36:59.236 --> 37:00.465
in, like, two weeks

37:00.500 --> 37:02.067
'cause I've been taking
these great pills.

37:02.102 --> 37:03.101
Oh.

37:03.136 --> 37:04.066
Yeah.

37:04.101 --> 37:05.834
So Gloria's nuts.

37:11.267 --> 37:12.500
You want to talk?

37:15.101 --> 37:16.934
Yeah.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.732
Come in.

37:18.767 --> 37:22.368
I think that you should
have a drink.

37:22.403 --> 37:23.385
Sheil...

37:23.420 --> 37:24.333
Tom.

37:24.368 --> 37:25.800
- Sheil...
- Come on.

37:25.835 --> 37:26.765
No.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.099
I'm serious.

37:28.134 --> 37:30.800
I have had a lot of wine,
and you have had nothing.

37:30.835 --> 37:32.633
That puts us
on uneven playing fields.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.934
What's that
supposed to mean?

37:34.969 --> 37:37.351
Tommy...

37:37.386 --> 37:39.734
Come on.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.366
You know what?

37:44.401 --> 37:45.498
I've been thinking
about this,

37:45.533 --> 37:47.099
and I think the whole thing
with Gloria

37:47.134 --> 37:49.334
just made it kind of
clear to me in my head.

37:49.369 --> 37:51.834
I don't think
it's a good idea.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.366
Okay?

37:53.442 --> 37:57.181
I mean, the guys frown on it
because, you know, it's--

37:57.208 --> 37:58.713
It's fooling around with widows,

37:58.752 --> 37:59.776
and the widows
frown on it.

37:59.794 --> 38:01.035
I don't think
anybody thinks--

38:01.059 --> 38:03.411
- I don't care.
- I do.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.532
I can't meet anybody.

38:08.567 --> 38:11.067
I can't get Jimmy
out of my mind.

38:11.102 --> 38:12.099
He's always there,

38:12.134 --> 38:14.633
and you are the closest thing
I have to him.

38:14.668 --> 38:19.101
You're sweet...
you're funny...

38:19.136 --> 38:20.665
and you're here.

38:20.700 --> 38:23.717
Right now.
Right here.

38:23.752 --> 38:25.943
Christ, you lost Jimmy.

38:25.978 --> 38:28.099
You just lost Billy Warren.

38:28.134 --> 38:30.334
I mean, how long do you think
all of us have?

38:30.369 --> 38:32.434
Today is what we have.

38:32.469 --> 38:33.498
Tonight, Tommy.

38:33.533 --> 38:35.867
This is what we have!

38:45.034 --> 38:46.767
What are you looking for?
What are you doing?

38:58.834 --> 38:59.767
Take it easy, Tommy.

39:05.834 --> 39:07.366
Ahh.

39:07.569 --> 39:10.192
That's what you wanted, right?
Huh?

39:14.667 --> 39:15.932
Ahh.

39:15.967 --> 39:17.834
That good enough for you?

39:20.267 --> 39:21.865
Huh?

39:21.900 --> 39:24.468
That what you wanted?

39:28.201 --> 39:29.867
Huh, little girl?

39:33.633 --> 39:35.734
Huh? Huh?

39:39.867 --> 39:43.167
You know this is bad,
right?

39:45.134 --> 39:46.632
Say it.

39:46.667 --> 39:47.867
- It's bad.
- Say, "It's bad."

39:47.902 --> 39:49.500
It's so bad.

39:53.934 --> 39:54.934
- Huh?
- It's so bad.

39:54.969 --> 39:56.234
Yeah.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.234
Happy now? Huh? Huh?

40:08.368 --> 40:09.567
You know how wrong this is?

40:09.602 --> 40:11.751
- Yeah.
- Huh?

40:11.786 --> 40:13.743
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

40:13.778 --> 40:15.700
Ahh! Ah!

40:20.334 --> 40:22.034
Ahh!

40:26.101 --> 40:28.598
Ohh. Yeah.

40:28.633 --> 40:30.401
Get up. Get up.

40:32.567 --> 40:34.117
Ohh! Ooh!

40:34.152 --> 40:35.667
Oh, yeah.

40:35.702 --> 40:37.167
Mmm!

40:37.202 --> 40:38.618
Ohh.

40:38.653 --> 40:40.034
Oh!

40:48.934 --> 40:51.533
Yeah, Sheila.

40:51.568 --> 40:52.500
Hmm...

40:53.967 --> 40:55.567
Oh, my God.

40:55.602 --> 40:57.132
Oh, my God.

40:57.167 --> 40:58.767
I want you to go
into the kitchen...

40:58.802 --> 41:00.433
Yeah?

41:00.468 --> 41:05.434
And pour me another
nice tall... whiskey.

41:05.469 --> 41:07.598
But...

41:07.633 --> 41:09.767
you're still aroused.

41:09.802 --> 41:11.366
Mm-hmm.

41:11.401 --> 41:14.317
- You didn't finish.
- Nope.

41:14.352 --> 41:16.393
Plenty of time for that.

41:16.428 --> 41:18.434
Now, go get me that whiskey.

41:19.767 --> 41:20.700
Go ahead.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.567
I can barely walk.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

41:33.734 --> 41:36.834
That was fun, right?

41:36.869 --> 41:38.934
Mm-hmm!

41:46.201 --> 41:48.834
You know what?
This remote's broken.

41:48.869 --> 41:51.468
I'm going to get it fixed
for you.

41:51.503 --> 41:53.665
Oh. Okay.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.667
I couldn't find a glass.

41:57.401 --> 41:58.533
- You climbing back on?
- Yeah.

41:58.568 --> 42:01.700
- Ohh, my God.
- Yeah.

42:01.735 --> 42:02.700
You like that?

42:02.735 --> 42:04.368
Yeah.

42:04.403 --> 42:06.001
Mm-hmm.

42:07.001 --> 42:08.199
Oh, shit.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.234
What?
What's wrong?

42:09.269 --> 42:10.934
- I got--
- What?

42:10.969 --> 42:12.284
- I gotta go.
- No.

42:12.319 --> 42:13.710
- I gotta go.
- No!

42:13.745 --> 42:15.101
- Yes.
- Mom?

42:15.136 --> 42:16.132
Oh, my God.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.767
Careful, careful.
Here. Take that.

42:17.802 --> 42:20.800
Your top, your top.

42:22.934 --> 42:25.598
Hey, guys, check it out.

42:25.633 --> 42:28.500
Picture of Billy
in The Post today.

42:30.567 --> 42:32.132
What's this?

42:32.167 --> 42:33.732
That mark on the top
is the length

42:33.767 --> 42:35.567
and the mark on the bottom
is the width.

42:35.602 --> 42:37.633
I couldn't get the girth.

42:37.668 --> 42:38.734
Hey, Billy, huh?

42:38.769 --> 42:40.066
Yeah.

42:40.101 --> 42:42.134
"Biggest dick in the house"
contest is over, folks.

42:42.169 --> 42:43.932
Kiss the ring.

42:43.967 --> 42:45.167
Forget about Franco
and his nine

42:45.202 --> 42:46.934
and four and three quarters.

42:46.969 --> 42:48.899
Why is that?

42:48.934 --> 42:51.001
Well, remember how shocked
we all were

42:51.036 --> 42:52.234
at how attractive
Billy's ex-wife

42:52.269 --> 42:53.234
and his
girlfriend were?

42:53.269 --> 42:54.199
Yeah.

42:54.234 --> 42:55.399
Well, I talked
to the ex-wife

42:55.434 --> 42:57.384
and told her how great
her speech was,

42:57.419 --> 42:59.299
told her how much we
all love Billy

42:59.334 --> 43:01.834
and told her we were
having this little contest,

43:01.869 --> 43:03.333
blah blah blah blah blah,

43:03.368 --> 43:06.633
and as it turns out,
Billy was packing 10.

43:06.668 --> 43:07.732
No way.

43:07.767 --> 43:08.850
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

43:08.885 --> 43:09.899
Nice work, Bill.

43:09.934 --> 43:11.800
What's with the remote?

43:11.835 --> 43:13.451
Um...

43:13.486 --> 43:15.067
Broken.

43:31.934 --> 43:33.301
Jim?

43:40.633 --> 43:43.767
Looks like
it's you and me, asshole.
