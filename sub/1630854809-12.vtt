WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:01.697
<i>Previously on "The Ark"...</i>

00:01.697 --> 00:02.915
This is Lieutenant Garnet
of Ark 1.

00:02.915 --> 00:05.092
We have your spider DNA.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.355
- Did you make it in?
- I'’m in.

00:07.355 --> 00:09.313
When will they realize we gave
them the wrong spider DNA?

00:09.313 --> 00:11.489
Brice!
<i>Can you see
what other elements</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:12.925
they'’re combining with the venom
to create the cure?

00:12.925 --> 00:16.451
Potassium, aluminum sulfate
in formaldehyde?

00:16.451 --> 00:17.887
From these results,
it looks like the injection

00:17.887 --> 00:19.541
had no effect whatsoever
on Brice'’s blood.

00:19.541 --> 00:22.413
- I told you not to fall for me.
- Well, too late.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.286
I hope that you and I
will move into a room
together one day.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.244
Let'’s go.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.898
We'’re almost
at the shuttle bay.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.074
We got a problem here, guys.
We can'’t seem to take off.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.163
Someone has to pull
a release lever.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.556
Okay, then where is that?

00:34.556 --> 00:36.036
In the airlock,
outside the shuttle.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.950
- Someone has to stay behind.
- I'’ll stay.

00:37.950 --> 00:41.041
- You need to get back to Ark 1.
- Don'’t die.

00:46.481 --> 00:49.266
You made it!
Nice to see you, too.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.663
I'’m just-- I'm just really
happy you'’re all safe.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.230
Good to see you, too, guys.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.754
Felix, have someone
take Trust back to lockup.

00:58.754 --> 01:01.061
Really?
We'’re not past this?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.279
You'’re going to need
my help with Evelyn.

01:06.631 --> 01:10.287
- Where'’s Brice?
- Uh, med bay.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.724
He'’s not doing well.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.770
The Klampkins cure
didn'’t work?

01:16.772 --> 01:18.078
Lane?

01:28.479 --> 01:30.090
Come on, man.
You know I'’m not getting
out of that brig.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.146
Try to relax.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.496
- What happened?
- You don'’t remember?

02:28.496 --> 02:32.152
I remember you gave me
the injection and, uh...

02:32.152 --> 02:35.720
Let me guess,
it wasn'’t a cure.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.159
I followed all
of Ark 15'’s research.

02:39.159 --> 02:43.032
- It should have worked.
- But it didn'’t.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.818
- No!
- Just stay away from me.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.342
Do not take it out
on Dr. Kabir.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.560
She'’s trying to help you.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.564
I'’m not angry
at either of you, okay?

02:53.564 --> 02:55.566
I'’m angry at myself
for ever believing

02:55.566 --> 02:56.654
that this
could actually work.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.270
This is what I'’ve been
trying to tell you.

03:03.270 --> 03:06.229
Sometimes it'’s worse
to have hope.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.421
Lane to Ark 1.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.075
Garnet?

03:26.075 --> 03:27.337
Lane, tell me you'’re all right.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.644
I would, but I promised

03:29.644 --> 03:31.428
I'’d never lie to you again.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.821
<i>Can you hid until
we'’re able to get over there?</i>

03:32.821 --> 03:34.562
No, no, no,
you can'’t come back for me.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.041
<i>You need to charge
your FTL and go.</i>

03:36.041 --> 03:37.217
Ark 15 will just chase us.

03:42.657 --> 03:46.748
- Not if I destroy their FTL.
- If we leave, you'’ll be
stranded on Ark 15.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.838
- It'’s suicide.
- And your point is?

03:53.972 --> 03:56.888
We'’ve run
the simulation five times.
It should have cured him.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.717
- I don'’t know
where I went wrong.
- Maybe you didn'’t.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.938
- Maybe Ark 15'’s
scientists screwed up.
- No, the science is sound.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.723
The combined mixture
should neutralize
the toxin in his blood.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.683
All I can think
is that maybe I mixed
the proportions incorrectly.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.511
But I checked your work.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.643
Not that I can'’t
make a mistake, too.

04:12.643 --> 04:17.387
- What happened
to the spider venom?
- Oh, that can'’t be it.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.824
- The venom'’s liquid.
- Wait, wait, wait.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.610
Wait, wait,
this is interesting.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.525
"The Mediterranean
recluse spider'’s venom

04:24.525 --> 04:26.701
decays upon exposure
to helium."

04:26.701 --> 04:30.574
But how would it have come
into contact with helium?

04:30.574 --> 04:34.578
The CO2 scrubbers
that produce our oxygen

04:34.578 --> 04:36.406
produce a byproduct of helium.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.626
So our artificial air
must have a small amount
of helium in it.

04:38.626 --> 04:41.150
But apparently it'’s enough
to make the venom degrade?

04:41.150 --> 04:42.978
The cure was never
going to work because

04:42.978 --> 04:46.198
the venom loses its potency
in the artificial atmosphere.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.549
Okay, so we need to introduce
the venom to his bloodstream

04:48.549 --> 04:52.727
without exposing it
to the air.

04:52.727 --> 04:56.296
We have to let the spiders
bite Lieutenant Brice.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.559
Oi, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.169
Tell me I'’m still passed out
and this is a coma dream.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.477
- Dr. Kabir is right.
- I know, but come on, man.

05:03.477 --> 05:07.394
- Bite me?
- Are you afraid of spiders?

05:07.394 --> 05:09.700
Oh, you-- you want to put
your hand in there, do you?

05:09.700 --> 05:12.442
- Look at those things, man.
- I know they'’re terrifying,

05:12.442 --> 05:15.097
but we don'’t know when
your next attack may occur.

05:15.097 --> 05:18.274
- This may be the only way.
- Oh, come on.

05:23.279 --> 05:26.195
Okay, this is the first
two components of the serum.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.893
Once your bitten,
the pure venom
should catalyze them.

05:28.893 --> 05:32.810
I'’m sticking my hand
in there on a "should"?

05:32.810 --> 05:35.117
It will. Probably.

05:39.382 --> 05:43.778
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah. Sorry, no,
I'’m just, uh--

05:43.778 --> 05:46.128
I'’m just questioning
my life choices here.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.043
Hey, you can do it.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.176
All right.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.490
- Yep, I can'’t look.
- You can'’t look?

06:00.490 --> 06:02.231
Right.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.460
Oh, I can feel their
evil little legs just--

06:13.460 --> 06:14.896
just crawling
all over me, man.

06:14.896 --> 06:18.247
Oh, they'’re really
interested in you.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.162
Oh, that one looks like it'’s
taking a nap on your finger.

06:20.162 --> 06:23.383
- You'’re not helping, Nevins.
- Why aren'’t they biting?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.820
Maybe we need
to make them angry.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.082
No, no, please don'’t.
Please don'’t.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.040
It'’s working!

06:29.040 --> 06:31.347
- They'’re biting!
- I know! I know they'’re biting!

06:31.347 --> 06:34.350
How long do I have
to put up with this for?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.351
Uh, yeah,
that should be enough.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.135
Thank you, thank you.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.790
Thank you, Heavenly Father.
Thank you.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.056
Yeah, like you'’re
never afraid of anything.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.364
I'’m at the engine room.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.539
<i>Okay,
a standard crew rotation</i>

06:49.539 --> 06:50.801
<i>has five techs on duty.</i>

06:50.801 --> 06:52.977
Yes, but I have
the element of surprise.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.066
<i>There might be more than
five techs on the ship.</i>

06:55.066 --> 06:57.504
- <i>Maybe we should
rethink this plan.</i>
- There'’s no time.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.940
I'’m going in.

07:04.815 --> 07:08.340
Hi.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.560
Engine room secure.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.780
Good work.
How many were there?

07:12.780 --> 07:15.478
Eh, about 10.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.227
What'’s that noise?

07:25.227 --> 07:27.621
Alarms. Kelly called it
the most valuable tech

07:27.621 --> 07:29.100
in the universe, remember?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.236
It'’s done.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.107
<i>Maddox can'’t follow you.</i>

07:36.107 --> 07:38.109
<i>Now you need to get
out of there right now.</i>

07:39.502 --> 07:42.810
- Lane?
- Spencer?

07:42.810 --> 07:45.073
<i>Mr. Lane
can'’t talk right now.</i>

07:46.857 --> 07:49.947
But don'’t worry.
I'’ll be in touch.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.178
Hey.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.789
You have to prepare
yourself for the inevitable.

08:05.789 --> 08:11.491
- This isn'’t gonna work.
- Then why'’d you let
those spiders bite you?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.276
Well, I just figured
it couldn'’t hurt, you know,

08:14.276 --> 08:16.017
to face my one and only fear.

08:16.017 --> 08:20.021
And why are you
so afraid of hope?

08:20.021 --> 08:22.806
It'’s not that, sweetheart.

08:22.806 --> 08:27.202
What I'’m afraid of is
seeing the look on your face

08:27.202 --> 08:29.509
when they tell me
it hasn'’t worked.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.468
Alicia.

08:41.956 --> 08:45.568
- Um, we have the results.
- And?

08:45.568 --> 08:48.223
I want to caution you
that this is an
experimental treatment--

08:48.223 --> 08:49.877
Please don'’t.
Just cut to the chase, okay?

08:49.877 --> 08:52.009
Just tell me,
how long do I have?

08:52.009 --> 08:53.402
Is it an hour?
Is it a week? What is it?

08:53.402 --> 08:54.708
- Well--
- You'’re cured.

08:57.798 --> 09:02.106
- What?
- Cured might be
an overstatement.

09:02.106 --> 09:06.067
The toxin damaged
your liver, kidneys,
and neurological system.

09:06.067 --> 09:11.072
- Now, the liver--
- Doc, come on.

09:11.072 --> 09:15.293
- It worked.
- Yes.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.689
It appears to have worked.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.778
I'’m sorry, what's worked?

09:21.778 --> 09:23.432
There are no longer

09:23.432 --> 09:28.002
any visible Klampkins toxins
in your blood.

09:28.002 --> 09:31.527
The venom neutralized it.

09:31.527 --> 09:32.572
Right.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.404
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.189
Yeah.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.671
I'’m so sorry, doc.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.543
Um, I think the cure'’s
got some funny side effects.

09:47.543 --> 09:50.502
It'’s done something
weird to my eyes.

10:15.223 --> 10:18.226
- Eva?
- I'’m--

10:18.226 --> 10:20.620
I'’m fine, really, it's just--

10:26.800 --> 10:29.716
Brice? The cure?

10:36.461 --> 10:38.899
Thank God.

10:40.988 --> 10:44.165
How'’s he doing?

10:44.165 --> 10:46.167
It'’s taking him a minute
to process it,

10:46.167 --> 10:47.472
but he'’s fine.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.784
This is Garnet.
All members of council,

10:54.784 --> 10:57.657
please report to
the ready room immediately.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.231
I can'’t tell you how happy
I am you'’re Klampkins-free.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.712
Not as happy as me, mate.

11:09.712 --> 11:13.237
It'’s all thanks to Dr. K.

11:13.237 --> 11:16.066
Right, so what'’s so urgent?

11:16.066 --> 11:20.027
Well, Dr. Kabir
figuring out the cure
has put us on new ground.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.246
We now have
two things Maddox wants.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.988
The Klampkins cure
and Trust'’s planetary
rotation programming.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.164
Exactly.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.601
- We can make a trade.
- For Lane?

11:29.601 --> 11:33.605
Yes, and maybe
sharing the planet.

11:33.605 --> 11:38.132
But we have to act fast
before they can repair
their weapon.

11:38.132 --> 11:41.178
Smart.
Maddox takes the bait.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.311
We stick a gun to her head
the second she steps
out of the airlock.

11:43.311 --> 11:48.577
No. That'’s why humanity
is dying.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.753
Everyone is acting
like Trust and Maddox.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.322
We have to be better
than them.

11:57.586 --> 12:01.503
Absolutely not.
I'’ll come over there
and take what I want.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.200
<i>Let me stop you
right there, Evelyn.</i>

12:03.200 --> 12:04.724
Ms. Maddox.

12:04.724 --> 12:10.077
Ms. Maddox,
your doctors screwed up.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.993
It took Ark 1'’s brilliant
doctor to figure out the cure.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.430
<i>She'’s now the only person
in the galaxy</i>

12:15.430 --> 12:16.605
<i>who can save your life.</i>

12:16.605 --> 12:18.433
You'’re lying. My doctors--

12:18.433 --> 12:20.130
<i>So, if you want to live,</i>

12:20.130 --> 12:22.045
you'’ll agree
to two simple conditions--

12:22.045 --> 12:24.134
releasing Lane to me
and sharing Proxima B.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.788
I'’ll never agree to that.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.617
Fine, Ark 1
will leave you here,

12:28.617 --> 12:30.140
stranded with
an incurable disease.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.447
Our FTL will be charged
in 30 seconds,

12:32.447 --> 12:34.928
<i>and I'’m guessing yours
can'’t charge.</i>

12:34.928 --> 12:36.494
Decide fast.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.761
Fine, I accept your terms.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.545
Excellent.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.026
And in the meantime,
Lane better not be hurt.

12:46.026 --> 12:46.853
Garnet out.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.901
How will that woman
double-cross us?

12:53.685 --> 12:56.776
She won'’t.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.822
How will that woman
double-cross us?

12:59.822 --> 13:02.869
Let'’s hope she doesn't.

13:05.523 --> 13:09.963
So you actually think
that I'’ll spin up Proxima B
and share it with Evelyn?

13:09.963 --> 13:12.008
I'’m not sure
why that'’s so amusing.

13:12.008 --> 13:15.011
Because you made the deal
without consulting me.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.405
Why would I consult you?

13:17.405 --> 13:18.754
You have no choice
in the matter.

13:18.754 --> 13:22.758
Perhaps, but I have leverage.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.194
I want my freedom.

13:24.194 --> 13:27.719
And then I--

13:27.719 --> 13:32.028
Now that'’s amusing.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.335
You have zero power here.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.338
You can share
your programming with all
of us, including Maddox,

13:37.338 --> 13:40.167
or I can give her you.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.129
Well, at least free Cat.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.653
I mean, she doesn'’t
deserve any of this.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.918
- Please?
- Why do you care?

13:51.918 --> 13:55.617
Because I talked her
into participating
in my little mutiny.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.097
She wouldn'’t have
done it otherwise.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.667
I'’ll consider it.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.627
Unlike you,
Cat regrets her actions,

14:05.627 --> 14:07.759
and helped us figure out
Maddox'’s plan.

14:07.759 --> 14:11.589
I should be asking for
better living conditions.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.635
Do you know how humiliating
it is to be escorted
to the bathroom?

14:13.635 --> 14:16.986
At least on Ark 15,
they had the decency
to build a proper brig.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.946
Yeah, you'’re the one
who built this ark, right?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.817
Maybe you should'’ve
thought of that.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.742
You'’re taking troops
onto Ark 1?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.700
You said Garnet'’s offer
is sincere.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.964
It is. So now
you'’re gonna screw her?

14:37.964 --> 14:41.924
I need the cure,
but I have no intention
of sharing Proxima B.

14:49.192 --> 14:52.282
You know, for a genius,
you really are an idiot.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.894
If Garnet is naive enough
to welcome me onto Ark 1,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.113
I'’d be a fool not to use
this opportunity.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.810
Do you want to live
or do you want
to destroy Ark 1?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.682
Because you can'’t do both.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.032
She'’ll give me whatever I want
with a gun or two to her head.

15:03.032 --> 15:07.036
Maybe. Or she would'’ve
assumed you would pull
something and prepared for it.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.519
Look, I know her.

15:11.519 --> 15:15.523
The only sure way
to get what you want
is to honor the deal.

15:19.614 --> 15:23.009
If this is gonna go south,
it'’s gonna happen right now.

15:23.009 --> 15:26.142
The second she steps out,
I want you and a security detail
to sweep the shuttle.

15:26.142 --> 15:29.102
Really wish we had more than
cattle prods and a hammer.

15:29.102 --> 15:32.148
- Put your hands up!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:32.148 --> 15:33.802
It'’s just me, guys.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.507
Welcome to Ark 1,
Ms. Maddox.

15:43.507 --> 15:47.555
- Please raise your hands.
- Is that really necessary?

15:47.555 --> 15:50.906
I'’m sure you understand.
The road to detente
can sometimes be rocky.

15:50.906 --> 15:54.040
- Detente?
- What else would you call it?

15:54.040 --> 15:59.262
Give me my cure first,
and then we'’ll see.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.090
Then I'’m sure you won't mind
if we search your shuttle.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.408
You should'’ve left.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.366
Yeah, I probably should have.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.847
But I'’m glad you didn't.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.727
Just to be clear,

16:29.727 --> 16:31.251
I am still mad at you, Spence.

16:35.081 --> 16:39.302
It'’s a very different
culture over here.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.696
We have a stowaway.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.049
How dare you bring
this woman onto our ship?

16:47.049 --> 16:48.920
She murdered members
of our crew.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.879
I don'’t know
what you thought
you were planning,

16:50.879 --> 16:51.793
but the deal is off.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.016
What were you thinking?

16:57.016 --> 17:00.280
- I'’m sorry, but--
- Spit it out!

17:00.280 --> 17:03.979
What'’s so important
that you'’d risk
blowing this exchange?

17:03.979 --> 17:06.764
You. You'’re dying.

17:06.764 --> 17:10.159
If the cure doesn'’t work,
I just-- I want to be with you.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.770
Well, you may have
just ruined everything.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.515
I'’m sorry about this, Lieutenant.

17:18.515 --> 17:24.347
Please forgive my daughter
her foolish sentimentality.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.784
Daughter?

17:31.528 --> 17:34.357
Don'’t mistake
compassion for naiveté.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.839
This is the last surprise
I will tolerate.

17:37.839 --> 17:41.538
And you, if you want
to be with your mother,
there are conditions.

18:02.646 --> 18:06.433
- I have to get bitten?
- I know it'’s unorthodox,

18:06.433 --> 18:08.652
but given the progress
of your Klampkins,

18:08.652 --> 18:09.610
we don'’t have time
to synthesize

18:09.610 --> 18:11.525
a preservative
for the venom.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.528
- It sounds like a trap.
- I'’m inclined to agree.

18:14.528 --> 18:18.097
Uh, look, I am proof
that Dr. Kabir'’s cure works.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.707
If you were ever sick
in the first place.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.317
Oh, yeah, no. No, no, no.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.189
I just let a load of spiders
bite the hell out of my hand

18:23.189 --> 18:25.016
so I could fool you
into doing the same just,

18:25.016 --> 18:27.584
- um, for a laugh, really.
- If I wanted to kill you,

18:27.584 --> 18:28.977
I would have thrown you
out of the airlock.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.936
Now that logic makes sense.

18:31.936 --> 18:35.114
Look, it'’s just a few seconds
of excruciating pain

18:35.114 --> 18:37.072
and then it'’s gonna be--
whoa, wow.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.769
You just--
you went straight in.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.031
Straight in with the hand.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.338
She didn'’t even have
to make them angry.

18:42.338 --> 18:45.907
Well, there'’s no
surprises there, is there?

18:45.907 --> 18:48.823
- Oh, God, I can'’t look.
- What happened
to moral support?

18:48.823 --> 18:52.348
I'’m serious,
I'’m gonna be sick.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.350
Can I go to the bathroom, please?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.876
She clearly takes
after her father.

19:06.232 --> 19:09.104
Thank you.
I couldn'’t watch, it was--

19:09.104 --> 19:12.194
Bathroom'’s just
around the corner.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.153
I won'’t make it.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.699
As you can see,
the newly formed compound

19:38.699 --> 19:42.485
has successfully attacked
the Klampkins molecules

19:42.485 --> 19:44.270
and put them into remission.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.013
- Is this real?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

19:49.013 --> 19:52.365
I'’m cured?
I'’m not gonna die?

19:52.365 --> 19:56.673
- Not of Klampkins.
- Now it'’s my turn
to trust you.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.197
I'’m counting on you
to keep our deal.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.246
Once my doctors confirm
that this worked,

20:04.246 --> 20:08.207
I'’ll keep my side of the deal.
We'’ll share the planet.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.558
Kelly attacked Griff and ran.

20:11.558 --> 20:14.169
What is your
daughter planning?

20:14.169 --> 20:16.389
Where'’s the farm boy?

20:21.350 --> 20:23.570
I know I was only gone a day,
but I really missed you guys.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.576
You would not have
liked Ark 15.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.498
I thought there was something
real growing between us.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.676
You used me.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.373
After everything
I did for you,

20:44.373 --> 20:49.596
you threw it all away
to be here with these people?

20:49.596 --> 20:53.426
To be with some stupid plants?

20:53.426 --> 20:55.776
His plants are not stupid.

20:57.299 --> 21:01.608
Angus! Angus! Oh, my God.

21:01.608 --> 21:04.045
- Angus, are you okay?
- Thank you.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.790
I-- I didn'’t hit her
that hard, did I?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.139
What did you do?

21:11.139 --> 21:14.577
What?

21:14.577 --> 21:16.187
What happened to my daughter?

21:16.187 --> 21:18.755
It was an accident.
Kelly, she just--

21:18.755 --> 21:21.584
It'’s my fault.
Kelly came for me.
I protected myself.

21:21.584 --> 21:24.892
- You did this?
- Yes.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.767
If you hadn'’t saved my life,

21:30.767 --> 21:32.595
this would have
a very different outcome.

21:53.834 --> 21:58.404
I'’m not hungry.
Just put the gruel
in the corner.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.840
I'’m not the help, Will.

22:04.584 --> 22:07.587
I thought I would
never see you again.

22:07.587 --> 22:10.981
Me neither.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.200
But I heard I have you
to thank for my freedom.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.333
Oh, it'’s the least I could do.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.074
I'’m sorry. For everything.

22:19.163 --> 22:21.165
Has anyone said anything
about Helena?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.297
About a memorial?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.736
No one on this ship
gives a damn.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.608
Well, Helena did lead
a mutiny with you.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.483
That'’s all the time
they'’ve given me.

22:34.483 --> 22:35.876
But I'’ll check in on you again.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.704
It'’s what Helena wanted.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.060
Are you out of your mind?

22:46.060 --> 22:49.498
- Your wife just died.
- Yes, I'’m sorry.

22:49.498 --> 22:52.414
I guess I'’m just desperate
for human contact.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.894
Believe me, so am I.

22:53.894 --> 22:57.680
I'’m free, but I'm not free.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.422
It'’s so obvious
from the way everyone stares
that they hate me.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.817
Right now,
I just need a friend.

23:03.817 --> 23:07.473
Sure, yeah.
I think that'’s probably
what I need also.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.778
Okay.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.574
Ms. Maddox,
she'’s bleeding
in her cranium.

23:21.574 --> 23:24.141
I don'’t have the facilities
to perform brain surgery.

23:24.141 --> 23:29.495
I do. I'’ll get Kelly back
to Ark 15 immediately.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.193
- With your permission.
- Of course.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.894
I hope she recovers, Ms. Maddox,
but you should know,

23:37.894 --> 23:40.419
even with surgery,
it'’s a long shot.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.770
They said the same thing
about Klampkins.

23:52.169 --> 23:55.477
- I'’m very sorry about Kelly.
- So am I.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.566
I almost hate to bring it up
right now, but--

23:57.566 --> 23:59.786
- Do we still have a deal?
- Yeah.

23:59.786 --> 24:03.006
You and your people
destroyed my weapons
and my FTL.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.008
You put my daughter in a coma.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.794
And how many of our people
did you kill?

24:11.580 --> 24:15.932
At the very least,
we could coexist as friends
without anymore killings?

24:15.932 --> 24:17.368
Despite what
you'’ve heard about me,

24:17.368 --> 24:19.849
I do keep my word,
Lieutenant Garnet.

24:19.849 --> 24:23.723
You get William
to spin up that planet,
and we will share it.

24:23.723 --> 24:27.030
But make no mistake,
we will never be friends.

24:39.652 --> 24:42.306
You look frustrated.

24:42.306 --> 24:45.745
It'’s the data from Proxima.
Something doesn'’t make sense.

24:45.745 --> 24:49.618
Look, the water on
the dark side isn'’t frozen.

24:49.618 --> 24:50.967
So?

24:50.967 --> 24:53.622
It'’s minus 20 on the dark side.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.060
Maybe it has a super high
level of salinity?

24:57.060 --> 24:58.845
That would keep it
from freezing.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.064
That'’s really smart.

25:01.064 --> 25:04.503
You just gave me
a whole new way
of looking at this.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.461
Thank you.
You'’re a lifesaver.

25:06.461 --> 25:10.291
Please,
you literally saved my life.

25:10.291 --> 25:14.164
You covered for me.
That was really cool.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.780
It was my fault
for trusting Kelly.

25:20.780 --> 25:24.653
- I was an idiot.
- I can relate.

25:32.269 --> 25:38.232
I mean, I can'’t believe
my first kiss was
with a murderer.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.363
Mine, too.

25:45.195 --> 25:50.897
I guess we'’ll just have
to make our second kisses
that much more memorable.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.992
Yeah, yeah,
I really don'’t want to

25:58.992 --> 26:01.995
mess up that second kiss.

26:01.995 --> 26:05.607
Yeah, neither do I.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.001
Uh...

26:08.001 --> 26:11.570
so show me more
about Proxima B.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.054
It'’s nice in here.

26:18.054 --> 26:21.144
It'’s almost like a walk
in a park back on Earth.

26:22.537 --> 26:25.932
Yeah, Earth before
the solar storms,

26:25.932 --> 26:27.890
carbonization,
the ocean swells.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.110
How I remember it as a kid.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.857
I think I need to start
being a little bit nice
to plant boy.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.554
He did do a good job.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.861
You could start
by using his real name,

26:41.861 --> 26:43.602
instead of calling
him plant boy.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.606
Yeah, well, let'’s--
let'’s not go crazy, shall we?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.869
Where is Angus?

26:49.869 --> 26:54.308
I might have asked him to, uh,
give us a place to ourselves.

26:54.308 --> 26:57.659
Oh. So this is a date.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.966
Well, you know,
if you have to ask,

26:59.966 --> 27:03.273
- I'’m obviously doing it wrong.
- No, you'’re not.

27:06.189 --> 27:09.758
Sorry, I just have
a lot on my mind.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.674
Hey, like what?

27:12.674 --> 27:17.331
We'’ve somehow managed
to make friends
with the crazy lady.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.160
- We'’ve cured my Klampkins.
- A lot can still go wrong.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.162
And now who'’s afraid of hope?

27:24.294 --> 27:26.035
This ship is fragile.

27:26.035 --> 27:29.909
Hey. Hey, listen to me.

27:29.909 --> 27:34.827
If there'’s anybody
who can keep this ship going,

27:34.827 --> 27:36.480
it'’s Alicia.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.005
I'’m serious.
She'’s a very, very
intelligent girl.

27:48.405 --> 27:52.627
- So how was the biodome?
- Oh, right, here she goes.
Very nice, thank you.

27:56.936 --> 28:01.723
Um, so I was wondering if--

28:01.723 --> 28:03.986
if I could come back
onto the bridge.

28:06.162 --> 28:10.079
Why wouldn'’t you
be welcome on the bridge,
Lieutenant Lane?

28:10.079 --> 28:12.821
I mean, I think you'’ve more
than re-earned your commission.

28:12.821 --> 28:15.432
- Agreed?
- Yeah, I think he'’s earned it.

28:21.569 --> 28:24.050
I'’ll only accept
on one condition.

28:24.050 --> 28:28.532
Brice has to agree
to start referring to you
as Captain Garnet.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.230
Because that'’s what
I'’d prefer to call you.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.971
Yeah, I think she'’s earned it.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.060
Okay, okay, I'’m honored, guys,

28:34.060 --> 28:36.584
but let'’s make these decisions
after we'’ve settled a bit.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.021
Fill us in.

28:41.154 --> 28:45.332
The science behind
my neodymium magnet rig
is actually quite simple.

28:45.332 --> 28:49.815
Evelyn already deployed them
along the planet'’s equator.

28:49.815 --> 28:52.469
Now, once activated,
they create a magnetic field,

28:52.469 --> 28:54.776
which puts pressure
on Proxima'’s poles,

28:54.776 --> 28:56.778
forcing the planet to rotate.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.301
So it'’s all just done
with frigging magnets?

28:58.301 --> 28:59.781
Very powerful magnets.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.870
It'’s kind of a brilliant way

29:01.870 --> 29:04.481
to utilize a planet'’s
magnetic poles.

29:04.481 --> 29:07.310
So once your device
jump-starts Proxima'’s rotation,

29:07.310 --> 29:09.791
- inertia makes it
self-sustaining, right?
- Yes.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.010
And you'’re sure
it will work?

29:11.010 --> 29:13.186
I'’ve never been
surer of anything.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.057
Then turn it on.

29:15.057 --> 29:17.277
Gladly.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.805
You may want to put some
distance between us and Ark 15.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.503
Things could get a bit turbulent
in terms of gravity.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.549
Don'’t want to have us
crashing into each other.

29:35.077 --> 29:38.689
That'’s good.
Now watch the magic happen.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.437
It doesn'’t appear
to be working.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.222
The planet isn'’t spinning up.

29:49.222 --> 29:53.704
Be patient.
Wait for it. It takes time.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.097
<i>Garnet, what have you done?</i>

29:59.275 --> 30:02.975
- What do you mean, Ms. Maddox?
- <i>I knew you'’d double-cross me.</i>

30:02.975 --> 30:05.934
- I don'’t know what you mean.
- Oh, my God, look!

30:05.934 --> 30:07.675
They'’re getting
too close to the planet.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.937
They'’ll get trapped
in its gravity

30:08.937 --> 30:10.721
and sucked down
if they don'’t move away.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.767
Evelyn, you'’re moving
too close to the planet.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.943
<i>I'’m not doing that. You are!</i>

30:18.468 --> 30:22.908
- What have you done?
- He only turned on
one of the devices

30:22.908 --> 30:25.649
and aimed its magnetic field
at Ark 15.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.478
It'’s dragging the ship
down to Proxima'’s surface.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.306
- The crash will kill them!
- Well, it'’s a shame

30:30.306 --> 30:32.831
that Evelyn didn'’t have someone
as smart as you on Ark 15.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.354
How can you be
so cold-blooded?

30:34.354 --> 30:36.225
Well, I don'’t see the problem.

30:36.225 --> 30:38.445
Once Evelyn is dead,
I'’ll actually spin up Proxima

30:38.445 --> 30:39.576
and we'’ll have the planet
to ourselves.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.883
Everybody wins.

30:41.883 --> 30:44.843
You'’ve really
convinced yourself you'’re
the good guy, haven'’t you?

30:44.843 --> 30:49.064
Evelyn Maddox and that kid
of hers are responsible
for Helena'’s death.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.762
There is no way in hell
I would let them live,
let alone share my planet.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.809
<i>I thought you might
double-cross me, Garnet.</i>

30:54.809 --> 30:56.724
<i>But I never thought you'’d kill
everyone on my ship.</i>

30:56.724 --> 30:58.769
<i>There are innocent people here!</i>

30:58.769 --> 31:01.598
You'’re gonna kill 400 people
who had nothing to do
with your wife'’s death?

31:01.598 --> 31:04.471
- And how many people
of yours did she kill?
- Her crew are innocent.

31:04.471 --> 31:07.430
Her crew chose to follow Evelyn,
and that makes them complicit.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.084
For all we know,
Ark 15 is more than half

31:09.084 --> 31:11.043
of what'’s left
of the human race.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.828
Are there more than
150 living people on Ark 1?

31:13.828 --> 31:18.528
- Yes.
- Then since we instituted
genetic diversity protocols,

31:18.528 --> 31:20.704
that'’s enough
to restart humanity.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.793
You are truly
one sick individual.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.013
They have less than
five minutes until impact.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.757
Ark 1 to Ark 15, do you copy?

31:29.757 --> 31:34.675
The EM field knocked out
some of their systems,
including comms.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.372
Wipe that stupid smile
off your face

31:36.372 --> 31:39.506
- and stop this right now!
- Even if I wanted to,

31:39.506 --> 31:42.422
and I really don'’t,
it'’s impossible.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.467
We'’d have to transmit
the shutdown code

31:44.467 --> 31:45.904
to the rotation device
on the surface.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.384
- Then do it.
- Not from this distance.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.995
We'’d have to move Ark 1
closer to Proxima.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.953
That'’s why you had me
move us away.

31:51.953 --> 31:54.390
And let me guess,
we get closer,

31:54.390 --> 31:56.131
and we get caught
in the gravity, too.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.350
And the magnetic field,

31:57.350 --> 31:59.178
which would shut us down
like Ark 15.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.919
You really thought
this through, didn'’t you?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.138
Well, I couldn'’t have you
do anything foolish,

32:03.138 --> 32:04.270
such as try to save her.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.230
Can you boost
the signal strength

32:08.230 --> 32:11.320
- then send
the command from here?
- Not in time.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.539
I could take the shuttle.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.801
Then we'’re only
risking one life.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.195
So now you'’ve
got a death wish?

32:16.195 --> 32:18.284
The shuttle'’s too small.
It would get pulled down
even faster.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.068
Mr. Trust'’s idea
is the only way.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.114
We need to move Ark 1
into a lower orbit

32:22.114 --> 32:25.944
- to send the command.
- My idea? I never
said any such thing.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.251
What about
the electromagnetic field?

32:29.251 --> 32:31.384
We'’ll just have
to transmit the code right
before our comms turn off.

32:31.384 --> 32:35.214
- Then what?
- And then we hope
that the device turns off

32:35.214 --> 32:39.392
with enough time for both arks
to escape Proxima'’s gravity
before we crash.

32:39.392 --> 32:43.657
So we either let more than
half the human race die

32:43.657 --> 32:45.833
or risk all of humanity
trying to save them.

32:48.531 --> 32:49.576
What do you think, Spence?

32:52.796 --> 32:57.149
Well, I know deep down,
you want to try the rescue.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.412
So far your gut
has been right a lot.

33:07.028 --> 33:11.293
Alicia, get
the shutdown code ready.
Brice, take us in.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.773
No! You'’re gonna kill us all!

33:14.905 --> 33:16.255
Now that just never gets old.

33:19.127 --> 33:20.215
Taking us in.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.961
Shutdown command is ready.
We just need to get closer.

33:26.961 --> 33:27.831
Yeah, I'’m working on it.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.489
We'’ll hit the magnetic field
event horizon in five,

33:33.489 --> 33:36.579
- four, three...
- Sending shutdown command.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.718
Did it work?
I-- I think.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.764
But it'’s hard to say
with our systems
fritzing like this.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.294
Whoo!

33:55.294 --> 33:56.947
Yeah, all right, all right.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.340
Save your applause until
we'’ve actually survived this.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.516
Sensors say Ark 15 is online.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.171
Ark 15, power up
your engines and go!

34:05.130 --> 34:07.219
A-ha! Looks like
they heard you.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.524
Get us back to orbit.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.139
We'’re clear
of the gravity from planet!

34:16.750 --> 34:19.796
All right,
now you wankers can cheer.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.594
How are you doing
over there, Ark 15?

34:34.594 --> 34:36.987
We'’re shaken, but we're okay.

34:36.987 --> 34:39.033
I have so many questions.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.079
Well, I think
I can sum up the answers

34:41.079 --> 34:43.603
by saying William Trust

34:43.603 --> 34:45.648
is a worthless
piece of excrement.

34:45.648 --> 34:48.086
I think that answer
will suffice, lieutenant.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.697
If the situation
had been reversed,

34:50.697 --> 34:52.264
I would have let you die.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.831
I know.

34:54.831 --> 34:59.140
<i>Remember how I said
we could never be friends?</i>

34:59.140 --> 35:02.535
- Yeah?
- I think I was wrong.

35:02.535 --> 35:03.579
And I'’m never wrong.

35:05.929 --> 35:08.889
I suppose there'’s
a first time for everything.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.682
This is all happening fast.

35:19.682 --> 35:22.337
So, what does this new peace
with Maddox mean exactly?

35:22.337 --> 35:24.426
She attacked us,
she destroyed Ark 3

35:24.426 --> 35:27.255
and her daughter murdered
members of our crew.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.431
We put her daughter in a coma
and almost crashed their ship.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.998
- That wasn'’t us.
- Maddox struck first.

35:30.998 --> 35:33.348
Look, I'’m not saying
it'’s gonna be easy.

35:33.348 --> 35:34.697
There'’s bad blood
on both sides,

35:34.697 --> 35:37.613
but for today,
let'’s take this win.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.138
I'’d hardly call any outcome
where Evelyn lives a win.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.879
Oi, oi, less talking,
more science.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.664
Remember our deal, Mr. Trust.

35:44.664 --> 35:49.147
The calculations
are now complete.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.801
- You'’re welcome.
- I'’ve triple checked
all the programming,

35:51.801 --> 35:54.326
the math, all of it.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.718
We'’re ready
to spin up Proxima B.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.420
Then let'’s make
this planet a home.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.946
Well, it'’s your life's work,
Mr. Trust.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.122
Would you care
to do the honors?

36:08.122 --> 36:10.298
You restore my faith
in humanity, Miss Nevins.

36:10.298 --> 36:14.041
No, not this time.
You do it, Alicia.

36:16.130 --> 36:21.179
Initiating operating sequence.
Transmission received.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.050
Confirming rotation
device sync.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.143
Planetary rotation device
is online

36:29.143 --> 36:31.406
- and functioning
within parameters.
- Look.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.022
Thank you, Mr. Trust.

36:41.503 --> 36:42.939
Back to my cell?

36:42.939 --> 36:46.204
Your genius knows no bounds.
Strickland?

36:49.250 --> 36:53.385
Um, what'’s that?

36:53.385 --> 36:55.909
Oh, that'’s the terminator,
where sunlight hits
the dark side of the planet.

36:55.909 --> 36:58.303
Yeah, but it'’s moving
with the rotation.

36:58.303 --> 37:01.480
- I mean, it almost looks like--
- Fire.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.134
No, no, no, no, no.
Why didn'’t I figure
this out sooner?

37:04.134 --> 37:05.919
- Alicia?
- The weird readings
with the water

37:05.919 --> 37:07.137
on the dark side
of the planet.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.748
Yeah, the water
wasn'’t freezing.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.924
Because it'’s not water.
It must be liquid methane.

37:10.924 --> 37:13.318
Liquid methane
has lower freezing
temperature than water.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.885
And as it spins
into the sunlight,
it'’s heating up and igniting.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.844
So we found another planet
with continental fires?

37:17.844 --> 37:20.455
Worse.
The ocean on the dark side
of Proxima is deep.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.935
When it heats up,
it could detonate.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.111
Shut down the rotation devices.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.856
It'’s too late.
Proxima has already started

37:29.856 --> 37:32.250
- to spin under its own inertia.
- So we'’re just gonna stand here

37:32.250 --> 37:34.817
- and watch
our new home explode?
- We can'’t stay!

37:34.817 --> 37:36.602
This could be like
a planet-sized bomb.

37:39.213 --> 37:41.389
- FTL status?
- Still recharging.

37:41.389 --> 37:43.391
- NEPS?
- Only at 50%.

37:43.391 --> 37:44.958
I need you to get them
to full power.

37:44.958 --> 37:47.090
- I can'’t. Not from here.
- Go.

37:47.090 --> 37:51.965
Brice, do what you can.
Lane, hail Ark 15
and tell them to go.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.749
Here'’s hoping I didn't use up
all my miracles.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.111
<i>We'’re not going
fast enough, Eva.</i>

38:08.111 --> 38:09.504
<i>We need the NEPS
at full power right now.</i>

38:09.504 --> 38:11.376
I can'’t magically
make us go faster.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.725
What about
a double chemical burn?

38:12.725 --> 38:14.422
I did it once
on a lunar freighter.

38:14.422 --> 38:17.251
You want me to double
our U-238 load?

38:17.251 --> 38:19.166
- That'’s insane!
- It'’s just for a few seconds

38:19.166 --> 38:22.082
- till we clear the explosion.
- <i>That could blow up the NEPS.</i>

38:22.082 --> 38:25.825
- I have to run calculations--
- There'’s no time!

38:25.825 --> 38:27.566
Listen, we do this
right now or we die.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.617
Initiating double
chemical burn.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.533
Engines are hot.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.013
Everybody brace.

39:10.739 --> 39:14.003
- Nice flying, Brice.
- Yeah, good work, man.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.310
Eva deserves
just as much credit as I do.

39:19.792 --> 39:22.447
Hey, you.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.971
- <i>We did it.</i>
- It was your crazy idea.

39:24.971 --> 39:28.061
I feel bad I didn'’t figure out
the methane sooner.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.715
You can'’t anticipate everything.

39:29.715 --> 39:34.067
Proximity alert?

39:35.198 --> 39:36.809
What the hell?

39:52.085 --> 39:53.391
Damage indicators
on all decks!

39:54.914 --> 39:56.698
Lane to med bay!

39:56.698 --> 39:59.309
Dr. Kabir, prepare
for incoming patients.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.572
Med bay!

40:05.707 --> 40:08.057
Bridge to Engineering?

40:09.232 --> 40:10.320
Brice to Eva?

40:12.235 --> 40:13.323
Eva, respond.

40:14.455 --> 40:17.066
Angus, was the bioshelter hit?

40:17.066 --> 40:19.417
Angus! Angus, are you there?

40:21.027 --> 40:23.203
No.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.031
No, no, no, no, no.

40:25.031 --> 40:26.685
Attention, all hands.
Please respond!

40:31.603 --> 40:36.825
Can anybody hear us?
Please respond!

40:36.825 --> 40:39.175
- Shipwide comms are down.
- The damage is right
behind the bridge.

40:39.175 --> 40:42.396
- We'’re isolated
from the rest of the ark.
- It gets worse.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.791
We'’re venting oxygen
here in the fore section.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.184
I'’m afraid we won't survive
this one, lieutenants.

40:57.716 --> 40:58.760
Maybe we will.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.430
<i>Ark 1, can you hear me?</i>

41:19.041 --> 41:22.915
Ark 15,
we'’re badly damaged.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.831
Not sure of the casualty counts.
How you doing?

41:25.831 --> 41:29.356
We took no hits.
We'’re completely intact.

41:29.356 --> 41:34.143
But I'’m afraid, from here,
your ship looks very bad.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.626
Where'’d she go?

41:42.151 --> 41:45.154
I can'’t believe
that woman'’s our only hope.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.765
She tried
to blow us up twice,

41:46.765 --> 41:49.332
and now the planet'’s
done it for her.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.769
My bet is she leaves us to die.

41:57.515 --> 42:01.693
<i>We'’re sending
shuttles of rescue teams
and medical personnel.</i>

42:05.087 --> 42:08.700
- Thank you, Ms. Maddox.
- For what? I owe you.
