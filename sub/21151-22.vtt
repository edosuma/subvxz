ON THE BLOCK, JOSH HOPED TO TAKE

00:11.712 --> 00:13.747
OUT THE RADIO PERSONALITY.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.384
>> MY GAME IS GETTING ELENA OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

00:16.417 --> 00:20.188
NOW I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A
PLAN TO ASSURE THAT SHE WALKS

00:20.221 --> 00:22.523
THROUGH THE DOORS ON THURSDAY.
>> WHILE THE HOUSE WAS GUNNING

00:22.556 --> 00:24.992
FOR CODY'S MAIN SQUEEZE.

00:25.025 --> 00:30.898
>> SHE NEEDS TO GO FIRST.
>> EXPECTING JESS TO BE EVICTED,

00:30.931 --> 00:34.001
HE WANTED TO MAKE A DEAL.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.070
>> I WANT JESS TO GO FIRST.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.871
WE NEED TO GET IT GOING.

00:37.905 --> 00:42.076
>> MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS WHY
DON'T WE USE THEM TO BREAK UP

00:42.110 --> 00:45.313
THE SHOWMANCE.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.849
IT DOESN'T WORK.
>> WHEN HE PITCHED HIS PLAN TO

00:56.190 --> 00:56.857
AND ALEX.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.492
>> KEVIN, QUIT MAKING DEALS.

00:58.526 --> 01:02.263
I DON'T TRUST CODY WITH TYING
HIS OWN DAMN SHOES.

01:02.296 --> 01:07.101
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO TRUST HIM
WITHHOLDING THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:07.135 --> 01:08.802
SORT OF DEAL?

01:08.836 --> 01:12.206
>> AFTER JESS AND CODY WENT TOE
TO TOE WITH JOSH --

01:12.240 --> 01:13.741
>> OKAY.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.177
YOU GUYS ARE MAKING IT
PERSONAL --

01:16.210 --> 01:18.512
>> I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TODAY.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.215
JUST DON'T SPEAK TO ME.

TARGET.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.090

01:40.434 --> 01:43.604
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THE DEAL.

01:43.637 --> 01:47.608
>> BEFORE THE LIVE VOTE, JESS
CALLED OUT PAUL.

01:47.641 --> 01:52.546
>> IF YOU GUYS LEAVE HIM IN THE
HOUSE LONGER THAN YOU HAVE,

01:52.580 --> 01:54.482
YOU'RE BIGGER IDIOTS THAN I
THOUGHT HE WAS.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.451
>> IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO HALT HER
EVICTION.

01:57.485 --> 02:02.156

>> TONIGHT, WITH ALEX IN
CONTROL, WILL SHE TARGET CODY OR

02:33.120 --> 02:36.724
NEW ENEMIES BEING REVEALED?

WOULD MAKE IT THAT FAR.

>> I DID NOT THINK I WAS GOING
TO MAKE IT TO THE JURY.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.754
BUT WE MADE IT, BABY.

04:13.787 --> 04:17.625
I'M IN THE TOP!
WHAT'S UP?

04:17.658 --> 04:18.191
TOP TEN?

04:18.225 --> 04:19.460
TOP 11?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.128
I DON'T CARE.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.396
I'M STILL IN JURY.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.865
>> CODY IS HATING LIFE.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.300
HIS GIRLFRIEND IS GONE.

YOU MADE YOUR BED, NOW LAY IN
IT.

04:31.872 --> 04:38.646
>> JESSICA BLEW PAUL AT THE LIVE
EVICTION.

>> IF YOU LEAVE HIM IN THE HOUSE
LONGER THAN YOU HAVE, YOU'RE

04:41.882 --> 04:44.785
BIGGER IDIOTS THAN I THOUGHT YOU
WERE.

04:44.818 --> 04:48.221
>> I'M SITTING BACK LIKE YEAH,
PAUL IS RUNNING THE HOUSE.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.859
PAUL HAS CONVINCED EVER THIS IS
THE WAY "BIG BROTHER" SHOULD BE

04:51.892 --> 04:52.760
PLAYED.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.463
NOBODY HAS DISAGREED WITH HIM
THIS SEASON.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.564
IT'S WEIRD.

04:56.597 --> 05:06.440
WHEN WILL EVERYBODY CATCH ON AND
SEE IT FOR THEMSELVES?

05:06.474 --> 05:09.643
>> JESS IS OUT OF THE HOUSE.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.480
I'M IN THE GAME ALONE NOW.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.248
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REALLY
DESCRIBE IT.

05:15.282 --> 05:22.523
I'M HAPPY THAT JESS DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE AROUND THESE PEOPLE

05:22.556 --> 05:23.657
ANYMORE.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.726
I WISH SHE COULD HAVE GONE
FURTHER THAN ME IN THE GAME.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.695
SHE DESERVES TO GO FURTHER THAN
ME.

05:27.728 --> 05:32.800
I DO WANT TO PUSH FORWARD FOR
THE BOTH OF US TO STRIP THAT

05:32.833 --> 05:42.876
$500,000 FROM AS MANY OF THESE
IDIOTS AS POSSIBLE.

05:42.876 --> 05:50.217
$500,000 FROM AS MANY OF THESE
IDIOTS AS POSSIBLE.

05:50.250 --> 06:01.729
>> I KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT
I'M STILL PISSED.

06:01.762 --> 06:10.838
I KNOW ONE THING.

06:10.871 --> 06:15.042
>> I WANT TO TARGET MARK AND
ELENA BECAUSE THEY STILL TALK TO

06:15.075 --> 06:21.549
CODY A LOT AND I'M NOT QUITE
SURE.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.716
THEY'RE SKETCHY.

06:22.750 --> 06:30.290
THIS IS WHY I WOULD LIKE MARK
AND ELENA OUT OF THE HOUSE.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.160
>> A LONG DAY.

06:33.193 --> 06:38.666
FOR SURE.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.835
>> EXHAUSTED.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.871
>> NOTHING TO DO BUT WORK AND
SHOP.

06:55.549 --> 07:00.353
>> THEY'RE DISHONEST.

07:00.387 --> 07:04.892
>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY
DON'T GET TOO CLOSE TO THEM.

07:04.925 --> 07:10.598
>> I KNOW THAT ELENA CAN BE
SUPER PERSUASIVE AND MARK IS

07:10.631 --> 07:13.000
SHOWING TO BE A STRONG
COMPETITOR.

07:13.033 --> 07:21.008
IF ELENA AND MARK CONVINCE
ALLISON AND BRING IN CODY, THEY

07:21.041 --> 07:24.945
HAVE A REALLY STRONG ALLIANCE
AND THE NUMBERS.

07:24.978 --> 07:35.222
>> JUST TRY TO GET AS CLOSE TO
ALEX AS POSSIBLE.

07:35.255 --> 07:39.292
>> SO EVERYONE IS DOING THE
THING

07:39.326 --> 07:41.061
>>
>>

07:41.094 --> 07:41.662
>> YES.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.796
>> YES.

07:42.830 --> 07:49.236
>> SINCE I'M HOH, I'M INELIGIBLE
TO PLAY IN A TEMPTATION

07:49.269 --> 07:50.137
COMPETITION.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.206
IF CODY WINS SAFETY, THAT RUINS
OUR PLANS.

07:53.240 --> 08:03.350
WE HAVE TO MAKE EVERYBODY PLAY
TO GET A CHANCE OF BEATING CODY.

08:03.350 --> 08:10.691
WE HAVE TO MAKE EVERYBODY PLAY
TO GET A CHANCE OF BEATING CODY.

08:10.724 --> 08:18.065
>> THE SAFEST THING TO DO IS TO
USE TWO EXPENDABLE PAWNS.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.100
THAT'S MATT AN ELENA.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.420
>> WE'RE WORKING AS A GROUP.

08:40.453 --> 08:52.800
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.969
>> MARK AND ELENA DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

08:56.003 --> 08:56.804
THEY DON'T.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.705
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.807
>> THEN WE HAVE TO GIVE IN.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.776
WE HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST THEM
AGAIN.

09:06.279 --> 09:12.485
>> WORST CASE SCENARIO, SAFE WE
WIN SAFETY AGAIN, THEN WE PUT UP

09:12.519 --> 09:13.621
MARK AND ELENA.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.623
>> EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO GO
AFTER CODY.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.456
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

09:16.489 --> 09:20.060
HE'S BEEN A HUGE TARGET IN THIS
HOUSE.

09:20.093 --> 09:24.097
I WOULDN'T MIND SPLITTING UP THE
SHOWMANCE.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.081
>> I'M COMING FOR YOU EVERY
WEEK.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.249
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

09:42.282 --> 09:45.052
>> IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FROM THE
START.

09:45.085 --> 09:45.719
YEAH.

09:45.753 --> 09:51.058
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.525
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

09:52.559 --> 09:59.332
THE CRAZIEST THINGS IS, I WOULD
NEVER GET HER OUT.

09:59.366 --> 10:05.639
FOR HER TO GO AFTER ME WOULD BE
A WASTE OF HER HOH.

10:05.673 --> 10:06.807
BUT IT'S WHATEVER.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.642
I DON'T KNOW.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.444
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD TELL HER.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.312
I DON'T KNOW.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.347
>> EVERYONE WILL BE TELLING HER.

10:14.381 --> 10:20.120
>> I WANTED TO WORK WITH CODY.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.824
BUT WITH HIM ALIGNING WITH JOSH,
IT DOESN'T WORK.

10:23.857 --> 10:29.029
WHEN HE GETS HOH, IF HE DOES,
WHICH IS A SLIM CHANCE, HE'S NOT

10:29.062 --> 10:30.831
GOING TO PUT ME UP.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.301
>> YOU ALREADY HAVE TWO, YOU
KNOW THAT?

10:34.334 --> 10:42.109
>> YEAH.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.979
>> I'LL CONCEDE IN THE SAFETY
COMPETITION.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.014
>> I'LL HAVE TO.

10:47.047 --> 10:52.252
IF I DON'T GET THAT, I HOPE MY
CHIP GETS PULLED.

10:52.285 --> 10:57.490
>> THAT'S IT.

10:57.524 --> 11:08.635
>> THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.573
>> KEVIN.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.676
GO ON TO THE KITCHEN.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.913
>> HE CANNOT BE PLAYING A
SEPARATE SIDE GAME.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.049
>> GO SEE IF HE'S AWAKE.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.852
>> HE NEEDS TO BE TALKED TO.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.454
>> I FEEL LIKE HE WOULD FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THIS

11:27.487 --> 11:31.258
ENVIRONMENT IF WE WERE ALL LIKE
YO, DUDE, YOU NEED TO CHILL.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.461
>> KEVIN HAS BEEN EXTREMELY
SKETCHY.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.629
I KNOW KEVIN AND CODY ARE
TALKING.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.430
I DON'T LIKE IT.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.200
AT THIS POINT, CODY IS GOING
HOME.

11:40.233 --> 11:44.204
THE FACT THAT KEVIN TRIES TO
BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM IS

11:44.237 --> 11:45.305
STRANGE.

11:45.338 --> 11:51.979
>> YOU HAVE TO BE REAL CAREFUL
WITH TALKING TO CODY.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.480
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS IRRELEVANT.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.249
WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.417
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.752
HE TALKED TO ME.

11:58.786 --> 11:59.552
>> NOT THAT.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.721
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH
IT.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.491
THE THINGS YOU SAY WITH CODY
BECAUSE HE WILL USE IT AGAINST

12:04.524 --> 12:04.925
YOU.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.459
>> I KNOW THAT.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.660
DOESN'T MATTER.

12:07.694 --> 12:10.130
WHATEVER HE CESSNA DOESN'T
MATTER, IT'S ALL OUT THE DOORS.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.264
>> I KNOW.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.934
I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU --
>> I TOLD YOU IT'S OVER WITH

12:13.967 --> 12:15.302
WITH HIM.

12:15.335 --> 12:19.039
>> I WANTED TO TAKE HIM TO THE
END OF THE GAME, NOW I'M HAVING

12:19.072 --> 12:19.807
SECOND THOUGHTS.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.610
>> I DON'T REALLY TALK TO THE
KID.

12:23.643 --> 12:33.686
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T GET THE WRONG
IDEA.

12:33.686 --> 12:40.693
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T GET THE WRONG
IDEA.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.798
>> HOW YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT PAUL?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.399
>> WHY?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.701
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

12:48.735 --> 12:50.737
>> HE'S TRYING TO TELL EVERYBODY
WHAT TO DO.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.656
>> WE NEED TO WIN THIS SAFETY
COMPETITION.

13:43.690 --> 13:52.099
I WANT TO PUT MARK AND ELENA UP
AND CODY.

13:52.132 --> 13:56.870
STAY AWAY FROM THE THIRD
NOMINATION.

13:56.904 --> 14:04.177
>> I NEED SAFE THE JUST IN CASE
CODY WINS THIS WEEK.

14:04.211 --> 14:11.551
IF I CAN NOMINATE MARK AND
ELENA, I CAN HAVE MULTIPLE

14:11.584 --> 14:15.622
SHOWMANCE ON THE BLOCK.
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS

14:15.655 --> 14:16.823
THROWING IT.

14:16.856 --> 14:21.161
>> SO THE PLAN IS TO PLAY IN THE
COMPETITION AND TO THROW IT.

14:21.194 --> 14:25.298
>> THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ME
PROVING I'M TRUSTWORTHY.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.034
BUT THIS IS A RISKY MOVE.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.568
>> 100%.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.603
>> I HAVE NO PROBLEMS THROWING
IT TOMORROW.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.156
>> I'LL RECOMMEND IT TO
EVERYBODY.

14:49.189 --> 14:54.494
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> SO EARLIER IN THE WEEK, ALEX

14:54.527 --> 14:58.498
AND I ARE ON THE BENCH IN THE
BACK YARD.

14:58.531 --> 15:02.435
EXTREMELY LOUD OUT OF NOWHERE A
BABY STARTS CRYING.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.637
>> WHAT IS HAPPEN SOMETHING.
>> MAYBE THAT IS A CUE.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.805
>> ON TV?

15:05.838 --> 15:06.573
>> NO.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.241
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY
FUNNY.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.842
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT.

15:09.876 --> 15:14.781
I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST
CALLING US ALL BABIES.

15:14.814 --> 15:18.151
>> YOU WEIRDOS.

15:18.185 --> 15:21.288
>> COULD JUST PRESS THE WRONG
BUTTON.

15:21.321 --> 15:25.092
MAKE EVERYBODY WONDER WHAT IT
IS.

15:25.125 --> 15:30.697
>> THAT'S MY DOG, JAKE.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.799
>> LAWN MOWER.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.001
>> LAWN MOWER.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.170
>> AT FIRST, I WASN'T SURE
WHETHER WE WERE LISTENING TO IT

15:37.204 --> 15:37.670
OR NOT.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.974
>> WATCH THIS PART.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.276
READY?

15:43.310 --> 15:44.444
>> THAT'S LED ZEPPELIN.

15:44.477 --> 15:49.316
>> AND THEN --
>> I'M GOING CRAZY.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.718
>> MORE AND MORE WEIRD FUNKY
NOISES.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.854
>> I'M NOT LISTENING TO THIS.

15:54.887 --> 16:05.132
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

16:05.165 --> 16:13.040
>> THEN YOU SEE --
>> HEY, BABY.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.475
>> ALL THESE NOISES ARE GOING
OFF.

16:15.508 --> 16:20.080
I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK AT HOME.

16:20.113 --> 16:23.116
THIS REMINDS ME OF MIAMI, BABY.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.795
>> SO I'M HEARING THESE SOUNDS.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.132
BEING IN THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE
BEFORE, I KNOW THAT IF YOU HEAR

16:39.166 --> 16:43.236
A NOISE, YOU BETTER PAY
ATTENTION TO IT.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.272
IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT.

17:00.887 --> 17:05.592
*
>> JOSH, YOU MAY NOW ENTER THE

17:05.625 --> 17:09.729
DEN.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.067
>> WE WANT THE BACK DOOR CODY.

17:14.101 --> 17:19.072
ONE OF US NEED TO GO TO THE
TEMPTATION AND WIN IT AND GET

17:19.106 --> 17:26.413
THE OTHER THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO
PLAY A CHANCE FOR VETO.

17:26.446 --> 17:32.719
>> JOSH, ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH TO
COMPETE IN THE TEMPTATION

17:32.752 --> 17:33.953
COMPETITION?

17:33.986 --> 17:39.792
IF YOU WISH TO PARTICIPATE,
DRINK THE GREEN POTION.

17:39.826 --> 17:44.297
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK IT,
DRINK THE RED ONE.

17:44.331 --> 17:54.374
>> I'M NOT THE TARGET BUT YOU

17:54.374 --> 18:04.451
>> I'M NOT THE TARGET BUT YOU

18:09.656 --> 18:11.624
CAN NEVER BE TOO SAFE.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.261
>> GOING INTO THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION, I WANT TO COMPETE

18:14.294 --> 18:16.863
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS TELLING ME
CODY IS THE TARGET BUT I

18:16.896 --> 18:20.066
UNDERSTAND IF HE WINS SAFETY,
I'M BEHIND HIM ON THAT TARGET

18:20.099 --> 18:21.568
LIST AND I DON'T WANT THAT.

18:21.601 --> 18:26.173
THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE MY
SAFETY IS TO WIN THIS

18:26.206 --> 18:26.839
COMPETITION RIGHT HERE.

18:26.873 --> 18:33.346
>> IT GETS WORSE EVERY WEEK.

18:33.380 --> 18:38.218
>> GOING INTO THE DEN, IT'S
OBVIOUS EVERYONE IS GUNNING FOR

18:38.251 --> 18:39.486
ME.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.489
I KNOW I'M GOING TO PLAY BUT I'M
NOT SURE WHAT MY STRATEGY WILL

18:42.522 --> 18:43.723
BE YET.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.858
I CAN GO INTO THE COMPETITION
AND WIN FIRST AND GET SAFETY OR

18:45.892 --> 18:49.429
TRY TO GET LAST PLACE AND BE THE
THIRD NOMINEE AND PLAY IN THE

18:49.462 --> 18:49.862
B.O.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.932
>> FOR JESSICA.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.389
>> YOU DID IT!
>> WE WERE IN THE YARD.

19:16.423 --> 19:19.526
THE FIRST THING I SEE, A
BLUEPRINT OF THE WHOLE HOUSE.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.894
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WILL BE.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.798
ALL I KNOW, YOUR BOY GOT THIS IN
THE BAG.

19:25.832 --> 19:30.970
>> THINGS HAVE BEEN EXTRA
ANNOYING EVER SINCE THE NOISY

19:31.003 --> 19:32.739
NEIGHBORS HAVE MOVED IN.

19:32.772 --> 19:36.243
I HOPE YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION,
THIS WEEK, YOU'LL HAVE TO

19:36.276 --> 19:37.477
REMEMBER WHAT YOU HEARD.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.513
BUT JUST REMEMBER THE ORDER YOU
HEARD THE NOISES ISN'T ENOUGH.

19:40.547 --> 19:45.051
THE NAME OF THE COMPETITION IS
"WHERE WERE YOU?"

19:45.084 --> 19:46.419
THE GAME IS SIMPLE.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.121
JUST REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE
WHEN YOU HEARD A SPECIFIC SOUND

19:49.155 --> 19:51.758
FROM YOUR ANNOYING NEIGHBOR.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.961
THIS MEANS IF POSSIBLE, EACH OF
YOU COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT

19:54.994 --> 19:57.163
CORRECT ANSWER FOR EVERY
QUESTION.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.533
EACH ROUND, YOU'LL BE ASKED
WHERE YOU WERE WHEN A SPECIFIC

20:00.567 --> 20:02.735
SOUND WAS HEARD IN THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.606
YOU'LL ANSWER BY WALKING ON TO
THE BLUEPRINT AND STANDING ON

20:06.639 --> 20:09.376
THE ROOM YOU WERE IN WHEN YOU
HEARD THAT SOUND.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.078
FOR EVERY CORRECT ANSWER, YOU'LL
RECEIVE ONE POINT.

20:12.111 --> 20:15.548
THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS
AFTER TEN QUESTIONS WILL WIN THE

20:15.582 --> 20:16.649
SAFETY FOR THE WEEK.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.486
THE PLAYER WITH THE FEWEST
POINTS WILL BE THE THIRD

20:19.519 --> 20:20.353
NOMINEE.

20:20.387 --> 20:24.924
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY "WHERE
WERE YOU?"

20:24.957 --> 20:27.193
>> YEAH!
>> IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT THAT WE

20:27.226 --> 20:29.896
PREVENT CODY FROM WINNING AND
LOSING.

20:29.929 --> 20:33.666
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T HAVE CODY WIN
BECAUSE THEN HE'S SAFE FOR THE

20:33.700 --> 20:34.901
WEEK.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.037
IF CODY COMES IN LAST PLACE, HE
PUTS HIMSELF UP AS A SPECIAL

20:38.070 --> 20:41.541
THIRD NOMINEE WHICH GUARANTEES
THAT HE PLAYS FOR VETO AND THAT

20:41.574 --> 20:45.678
WOULD RUN THE PLAN OF BACK
DOORING HIM.

20:45.712 --> 20:51.183
ONE OF US NEEDS TO WIN AND MATT
NEEDS TO PUT HIMSELF UP AS THE

20:51.217 --> 20:52.419
SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.722
>> GOING INTO THIS COMPETITION,
I'M GOING TO THROW IT BECAUSE

20:55.755 --> 20:58.325
RIGHT NOW I'M FACING NINE OTHER
PEOPLE.

20:58.358 --> 21:02.329
I KNOW THE ODDS ARE STACKED HELY
AGAINST ME.

21:02.362 --> 21:06.533
MY STRATEGY IS TO GET LAST
PLACE, BE THE THIRD NOMINEE AND

21:06.566 --> 21:08.968
BE GUARANTEED TO PLAY IN THE
VETO.

21:09.001 --> 21:09.936
>> TIME FOR THE FIRST QUESTION.

21:09.969 --> 21:20.046
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD
THE LAWN MOWER?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.782
>> THIS COMP IS TOTALLY ABOUT
MEMORY.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.452
WE'VE BEEN HEARING SOUNDS IN THE
HOUSE THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

21:25.485 --> 21:30.590
IF I CAN GUESS CORRECTLY WHERE I
WAS WHEN THESE SOUNDS PLAYED, I

21:30.623 --> 21:31.591
EARN A POINT.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.727
THE PLAYERS WITH THE MOST POINTS
GET SAFETY.

21:34.761 --> 21:38.097
THE LEAST AMOUNT GOES ON THE
BLOCK AS THE THIRD NOMINEE.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.268
>> I KNOW FOR A FACT LAST WEEK I
WAS NEVER IN THE HAVE NOT ROOM

21:42.301 --> 21:44.270
WHEN THE SOUNDS WERE PLAYED.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.474
SO I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THE HAVE
NOT ROOM FOR EVERY ANSWER.

21:47.507 --> 21:51.143
>> I KNOW FOR SURE I HEARD THE
LAWN MOWER WHEN I WAS IN THE

21:51.177 --> 21:52.379
KITCHEN.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.081
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I GET EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THESE WRONG SO

21:55.114 --> 22:00.487
THAT CODY DOES NOT HAVE THE
OPTION TO BE THAT THIRD NOMINEE.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.223
>> THREE OF YOU HAVE ANSWERED
INCORRECTLY.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.894
I'M SORRY, MATT, CODY AND PAUL,
YOU'RE ALL INCORRECT.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.729
MATT, YOU WERE IN THE KITCHEN.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.631
CODY, YOU WERE IN THE BATHROOM.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.833
PAUL, YOU WERE IN THE BACK YARD.

22:13.866 --> 22:18.838
THAT MEANS THAT JASON, ELENA,
KEVIN, MARK, JOSH AND RAVEN ALL

22:18.871 --> 22:21.107
GET A POINT.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.442
QUESTION NUMBER 2.

22:22.475 --> 22:30.216
WHERE WERE YOU THE SECOND TIME
YOU HEARD THE DRUMS?

22:30.249 --> 22:35.688
>> I WASN'T THINKING TWICE WHERE
I WAS WHEN I HEARD THESE SOUNDS.

22:35.722 --> 22:39.459
SO I NEED TO CLEAR MY BRAIN,
RELAX AND TRY TO REMEMBER WHERE

22:39.492 --> 22:41.227
I WAS WHEN I HEARD THEM.

22:41.260 --> 22:41.894
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.563
>> SECOND DRUM SOLO.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.031
I THINK I WAS IN THE GREEN ROOM.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.867
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE
BATHROOM.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.868
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM RIGHT
NOW.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.337
>> I REALLY WANT TO WIN THE
SAFETY.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.941
IF CODY WINS SAFETY, THERE'S A
REALLY GOOD CHANCE I'M GOING

22:54.974 --> 22:55.608
HOME THIS WEEK.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.510
I'M WORRIED.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.377
>> I DON'T KNOW.

22:58.411 --> 23:02.014
>> FOUR OF YOU ARE IN THE WRONG
ROOM.

23:02.048 --> 23:07.787
>> THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ANSWERED
INCORRECTLY ARE RAVEN, MATT,

23:07.820 --> 23:09.355
CODY AND PAUL.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.058
RAVEN, YOU WERE IN THE RED ROOM.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.460
CODY WAS IN THE BATHROOM.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.227
PAUL WAS IN THE RED ROOM.

23:15.261 --> 23:27.740
QUESTION NUMBER 3, WHERE WERE
YOU WHEN YOU HEARD THE BABY?

23:27.774 --> 23:28.841
>> TOLD YOU HE WOULD THROW IT.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.109
>> I KNEW IT.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.979
>> IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT CODY IS
THROWING THIS COMPETITION RIGHT

23:33.012 --> 23:34.180
NOW.

23:34.213 --> 23:39.819
THIS COULD BE A HUGE PROBLEM IF
MATT GETS ONE ANSWER RIGHT.

23:39.852 --> 23:44.123
I'M FREAKING OUT!
>> LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE GOT IT

23:44.156 --> 23:47.527
RIGHT EXCEPT FOR TWO PEOPLE.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.929
CODY, YOU'RE INCORRECT.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.465
CURRENTLY SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE
TIED FOR FIRST PLACE.

23:52.499 --> 23:56.669
CODY AND MATT ARE IN LAST WITH
ZERO POINTS.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.771
QUESTION NUMBER 4.

23:58.805 --> 24:07.279
WHERE WERE YOU THE THIRD TIME
YOU HEARD THE JACKHAMMER SOUND?

24:07.313 --> 24:11.551
>> AT THIS POINT IN THE
COMPETITION, IT'S ESSENTIALLY UP

24:11.584 --> 24:14.053
TO ME TO OUTSUCK CODY.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.923
THE PART ABOUT THROWING THIS
COMPETITION, FOR ME TO GET THESE

24:16.956 --> 24:20.226
WRONG, I HAVE TO KNOW THE RIGHT
ANSWER.

24:20.259 --> 24:27.299
>> ALL OF YOU ARE CORRECT EXCEPT
FOR ONE PERSON.

24:27.333 --> 24:40.813
THE ONLY PERSON WHO MISSED THIS
QUESTION WAS MATT.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.415
>> I ACCIDENTLY GET ONE RIGHT.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.118
I DON'T REMEMBER A SINGLE TIME
THAT WAS IN THE HAVE NOT ROOM.

24:46.152 --> 24:52.659
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS THROW THIS
COMPETITION AND SOMEHOW SOME WAY

24:52.692 --> 24:54.527
I GOT AN ANSWER RIGHT.

24:54.561 --> 24:58.397
>> LOOKS LIKE YOU DID PAY A
VISIT TO THE HAVE NOT ROOM,

24:58.430 --> 24:59.599
CODY.

24:59.632 --> 25:03.469
YOU KNOW FOR SURE YOU DID NOT
STEP FOOT IN JOSH'S HOH ROOM

25:03.502 --> 25:04.604
LAST WEEK.

25:04.637 --> 25:07.506
WE YOU DIDN'T DEFAULT AND GO
THERE INSTEAD, WHO KNOWS.

25:07.540 --> 25:11.110
I'M GLAD YOU GOT YOURSELF A
POINT.

25:11.143 --> 25:15.181
>> CODY HAS ONE AND MATT HAS
ZERO.

25:15.214 --> 25:19.218
CURRENTLY A FIVE-WAY TIE FOR
FIRST PLACE.

25:19.251 --> 25:24.456
JASON, ELENA, JOSH, KEVIN AND
MARK.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.125
QUESTION NUMBER 5.

25:26.158 --> 25:35.434
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD
THE CHUG CHUG CHUG SOUND.

25:35.467 --> 25:40.206
ELENA, MATT, JOSH AND CODY ARE
ALL INCORRECT.

25:40.239 --> 25:45.845
AFTER FIVE ROUNDS, JASON, KEVIN
AND MARK HAVE PERFECT SCORES.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.079
TIME FOR QUESTION NUMBER 6.

25:47.113 --> 25:52.885
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD
THE DOG SOUND.

25:52.919 --> 25:56.022
>> I'M FEELING GOOD WITH ALL MY
ANSWERS.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.857
I'M TIED FOR FIRST PLACE.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.928
ALL I NEED TO DO IS GET THE
QUESTIONS RIGHT AND I'LL BE SAFE

26:01.961 --> 26:02.862
FOR THE WEEK.

26:02.895 --> 26:07.600
>> MATT, JOSH, KEVIN AND CODY
ARE INCORRECT.

26:07.634 --> 26:10.002
CODY HAS ONE, MATT STILL HAS A
ZERO.

26:10.036 --> 26:14.974
NOW IT'S A TWO-WAY TIE BETWEEN
JASON AND MARK WITH SIX POINTS

26:15.007 --> 26:15.341
EACH.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.043
QUESTION 7.

26:17.076 --> 26:21.347
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD
THE SAXOPHONE FOR THE FIRST

26:21.380 --> 26:22.281
TIME?

26:22.314 --> 26:25.818
>> I'M ON TRACK FOR GETTING THE
REST WRONG.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.220
MATT STILL OUTLOSING ME.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.589
I'M GOING TO STICK WITH MY
STRATEGY AND HOPING THAT AT

26:30.623 --> 26:33.325
LEAST ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HE
WILL GET RIGHT.

26:33.359 --> 26:44.236
>> ELENA, MATT, KEVIN AND CODY
ARE ALL INCORRECT.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.371
>> QUESTION NUMBER 8.

26:45.404 --> 26:54.146
WHERE WERE YOU THE FIRST TIME
YOU HEARD THE CAT NOISES?

26:54.180 --> 26:56.082
>> IT'S EITHER PARLOR OR HERE.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.283
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

26:57.316 --> 27:01.453
>> THE ONLY PEOPLE EARNING
POINTS ARE ELENA, RAVEN AND

27:01.487 --> 27:02.021
MARK.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.891
EVERYBODY ELSE IS WRONG.

27:04.924 --> 27:09.762
SORRY, GUYS.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.798
>> WE'VE WORKED HARD, MAN.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.766
>> MATT HAAS ZERO.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.067
CODY HAS ONE.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.603
MARK IS IN FIRST PLACE WITH
EIGHT POINTS.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.439
>> YES!
I TOOK A ONE-POINT LEAD.

27:20.472 --> 27:24.176
ALL I NEED TO DO NOW IS GET THE
LAST TWO RIGHT AND I HAVE SAFETY

27:24.210 --> 27:25.311
FOR THE WEEK.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.647
>> WE NEED SOMEBODY FROM OUR
TEAM TO WIN AND LOSE THIS

27:28.681 --> 27:29.816
COMPETITION.

27:29.849 --> 27:33.619
HOWEVER, CODY IS ONE POINT
BEHIND MATT AND MARKED IS IN

27:33.652 --> 27:35.722
FIRST PLACE FOR SAFETY.

27:35.755 --> 27:39.025
WE COULD BE LOSING PLAN A AND B
RIGHT NOW.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.592
>> QUESTION NUMBER 9.

27:40.626 --> 27:46.565
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD
THE GUITAR SOUND.

27:46.598 --> 27:51.303
>> TWO MORE ROUNDS AND THIS IS
IT.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.304
WE GOT THIS.

27:52.338 --> 27:56.542
>> FOUR OF YOU ARE STANDING IN
THE WRONG ROOM.

27:56.575 --> 28:05.551
RAVEN, MATT, JOSH AND CODY.

28:05.584 --> 28:08.320
>> IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.

28:08.354 --> 28:13.225
ONLY ONE POINT SEPARATES MARK
AND JASON FOR THE LEAD.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.928
ONE POINT SEPARATES MARK AND
CODY FOR LAST PLACE.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.463
>> COME ON, MATT.

28:17.496 --> 28:21.901
BLOW IT AGAIN SO YOU CAN FOR
SURE LOSE THIS COMPETITION AND

28:21.934 --> 28:23.836
TAKE CODY OUT.

28:23.870 --> 28:27.874
>> I'M HOPING MATT GETS ONE
RIGHT SO WE CAN FORCE A TIE AND

28:27.907 --> 28:30.009
I KNOW I CAN LOSE AGAIN.

28:30.042 --> 28:34.680
>> AND THE FINAL QUESTION, WHERE
WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD

28:34.713 --> 28:39.251
CONSTRUCTION NOISE?

28:39.285 --> 28:45.457
>> LOOKING GOOD!
>> WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL

28:45.491 --> 28:46.158
QUESTION.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.760
ANYMORE LAST PLACE BY ONE POINT.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.161
NEXT TO CODY.

28:49.195 --> 28:52.598
I'M JUST PRAYING THAT I WASN'T
ACTUALLY IN THE STORAGE ROOM

28:52.631 --> 28:55.434
WHEN THAT SOUND TOOK PLACE.

28:55.467 --> 29:04.911
>> ON THE FINAL QUESTION FOUR OF
YOU ARE INCORRECT.

29:04.944 --> 29:17.123
JOSH, KEVIN, CODY AND MATT.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.791
MARK, YOU WIN.

29:18.825 --> 29:22.829
MATT GETS LAST PLACE LIKE
ALWAYS.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.030
SORRY, MATT.

29:24.063 --> 29:28.767
THE SCORE WITH ZERO, YOU COME IN
LAST PLACE AND WILL BE THE

29:28.801 --> 29:32.071
SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.873
AND MARK, YOU'RE SAFE.

29:33.906 --> 29:38.310
>> I WIN AND IT FEELS AMAZING
FOR SO MANY REASONS.

29:38.344 --> 29:44.283
FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT WAS A
MENTAL COMP.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.152
FEELS GOOD TO BE SAFE FOR THE
WEEK.

29:46.185 --> 29:50.256
YOU'RE NOT TAKING ME OUT THAT
EASILY.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.359
>> ORIGINALLY I WAS GOING TO PUT
UP MARK AND ELENA.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.462
NOW MARK IS SAFE, THAT PUTS A
WRENCH IN MY PLAN.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.364
I HAVE TO FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE
OUT NOW.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.332
>> SO I SUCCESSFULLY LOSE.

30:00.366 --> 30:03.702
I'M GOING ON THE BLACK AS THE
SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

30:03.735 --> 30:08.074
I CANNOT BE HAPPIER ABOUT IT.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.541
>> MARK WINS.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.243
MATT LOSES.

30:11.277 --> 30:15.714
I WANTED TO LOSE THE COMP.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.749
NOW SOMEBODY ELSE NEEDS TO BE
TARGET THIS WEEK.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.304
>> WINNING THE SAFETY MEANS A
LOT.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.807
MY NAME KEEPS GETTING DRAGGED
THROUGH THE MUD DAILY.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.642
IT FEELS LIKE AN HOURLY BASIS.

30:43.675 --> 30:49.081
BUT ELENA IS PROBABLY GOING UP
THERE AND HER SAFETY IS IN

30:49.115 --> 30:49.715
JEOPARDY.

30:49.748 --> 30:50.682
THAT'S SLIGHTLY CONCERNING.

30:50.716 --> 30:53.485
>>
>> WHY?

30:53.519 --> 30:59.025
>> BECAUSE.

30:59.058 --> 31:03.829
>> I AM HERE BECAUSE JESSICA
GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO BE HERE.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.698
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

31:06.732 --> 31:14.273
NOW IT MIGHT BE SQUANDERED
BECAUSE I JUST COULDN'T THROW

31:14.306 --> 31:15.908
DAMN TEMPTATION COMPETITION.

31:15.942 --> 31:20.579
IF I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT KEEPS
GOING AFTER PAUL, HE WILL NEVER

31:20.612 --> 31:21.847
LEAVE THE HOUSE.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.851
I HAVE TO PUT IN PEOPLE'S MIND
PAUL IS GUNNING FOR THEM.

31:25.884 --> 31:29.021
WHO KNOWS WITH THESE PEOPLE.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.057
THEY'RE DAMN PSYCHOPATHS.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.828
>> CONGRATS.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.064
>> THANK YOU.

31:38.097 --> 31:41.934
>> I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT
MARK IS SAFE THIS WEEK.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.036
HE'S A BIGGER TARGET THAN ME.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.872
HOWEVER, THAT DOES PUT ME IN
DANGER OF BEING A PAWN AGAIN

31:46.905 --> 31:48.975
THIS WEEK.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.509
I JUST UNPACKED.

31:50.542 --> 32:00.586
>> I JUST TOLD HIM, LISTEN.

32:00.586 --> 32:08.460
>> I JUST TOLD HIM, LISTEN.

32:08.494 --> 32:12.231
>> YOU WANT ME TO PUT YOU ON THE
BLOCK?

32:12.264 --> 32:16.435
>> NOW THAT MARK WON SAFETY, I
HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER PAWN TO

32:16.468 --> 32:17.603
THROW UP.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.471
SOMEBODY THAT WE CAN TRUST TO
MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BETTER

32:19.505 --> 32:22.308
CHANCE OF WINNING THE VETO.

32:22.341 --> 32:27.113
>> IF I PUT YOU ON THE BLACK, IT
WILL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I'M BEING

32:27.146 --> 32:31.917
FAIR I.
>> I'M THROWING PAUL'S NAME OUT.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.452
HE'S A GOOD COMPETITOR.

32:33.485 --> 32:40.359
ONE OF US NEED TO BE UP THERE SO
WE DON'T MISS THE CHANCE AT THE

32:40.392 --> 32:47.433
POB.

32:47.466 --> 32:51.803
>> I HAVE TO MAKE THEM THINK
THAT HEY, I'M DOWN.

32:51.837 --> 32:52.371
I'M HERE TO PLAY.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.173
PUT ME AS A PAWN.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.174
I'M NOT SCARED.

32:55.207 --> 32:59.378
BUT REALLY, HOW ABOUT SOMEBODY
ELSE BE A PAWN?

32:59.411 --> 33:03.582
>> YOU GUYS TELL ME LATER.

33:03.615 --> 33:16.195
>> 100%.

33:16.228 --> 33:19.565
>> TODAY ARE NOMINATIONS.

33:19.598 --> 33:23.835
>> THE ONLY THING I'M SCARED
ABOUT NOW IN THIS SITUATION IS

33:23.869 --> 33:26.838
IF CODY WINS.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.741
DOESN'T TAKE ANYBODY OFF, A GOOD
CHANCE I'M GETTING VOTED OUT.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.078
THAT'S WHAT I'M SCARED ABOUT.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.346
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT I CAN
BE TAKEN OFF WITH A VETO?

33:34.380 --> 33:35.013
>> YES.

33:35.047 --> 33:35.881
THAT'S THE POINT.

33:35.914 --> 33:39.985
>> OF COURSE, YOU WANT ME TO BE
A PAWN.

33:40.018 --> 33:45.357
PERPETUAL PAWN ELENA.

33:45.391 --> 33:55.434
I CAN STILL THERE UNTIL YOU VOTE
ME OUT.

33:55.434 --> 34:01.840
I CAN STILL THERE UNTIL YOU VOTE
ME OUT.

34:01.873 --> 34:02.374
>> YO.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.743
>> WHAT UP?

34:04.776 --> 34:07.346
>> I'M GOING TO CHANGE.

34:07.379 --> 34:14.320
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE HITTING PAWN
STATUS?

34:14.353 --> 34:19.425
>> I FEEL LIKE SHE WILL.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.793
EITHER ME OR MARK.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.462
>> OH, YEAH.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.331
>> NOW MARK SAYS IT'S ME.

34:25.364 --> 34:28.267
>> PAWN ON THEIR SIDE.

34:28.300 --> 34:28.634
YEAH.

34:28.667 --> 34:32.104
>> PROBABLY.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.405
>> I FEEL EXPENDABLE.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.541
I DON'T LIKE THAT FEELING.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.711
>> EITHER WAY, LAST WEEK TO
HEDGE THEIR BET WITH ME, KEVIN

34:39.745 --> 34:40.946
CAME UP TO ME.

34:40.979 --> 34:45.451
HE SAID, KEVIN, JASON, ALEX AND
PAUL ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.887
THEY WANT ME TO LIKE JOIN THEIR
ALLIANCE.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.690
I COULD BE SAFE FOR LIKE FIVE
WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.427
I'M LIKE OKAY, YEAH, COOL,
KEVIN.

34:55.461 --> 35:05.204
THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING AFTER
MARK FIRST AND THEN YOU.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.206
SERIOUSLY, I'M ALL BY MYSELF IN
THIS GAME.

35:07.239 --> 35:12.678
SO I HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING IN
PEOPLE'S MIND THAT PAUL IS

35:12.711 --> 35:15.547
EASILY HANDLELY RUNNING THE
HOUSE.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.483
I WANT MORE TRUST WITH ELENA.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.286
I WANT HER TO REALIZE THAT PAUL
IS NOT ON HER SIDE AND SHE'S

35:20.319 --> 35:24.390
ALWAYS THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL
AND SHE NEEDS TO START MAKING

35:24.423 --> 35:25.557
MOVES IN THE GAME.

35:25.591 --> 35:29.961
>> I PROBABLY CONFIDE IN MORE
THAN PAUL THAN ANYBODY ELSE

35:29.995 --> 35:31.096
GAME-WISE.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.365
SO HEARING THAT HE'S TURNING
AWAY FROM ME, I'M PISSED.

35:33.399 --> 35:38.337
>> THE THING IS, PAUL HAS TO
DEAL WITH EVERYBODY AT THE TOP.

35:38.370 --> 35:42.741
>> GUYS COME OUT SQUEAKY CLEAN.

35:42.774 --> 35:46.445
>> AND THERE'S PAUL STANDING
THERE IN THE END.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.414
>> YEP.

35:48.447 --> 35:51.149
>> NOBODY WANTS TO DRAW A LINE
IN THE SAND BECAUSE THEY THINK

35:51.183 --> 35:52.618
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A TARGET.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.587
YOU ARE ALREADY TARGETS.

35:55.621 --> 36:05.731
YOU AND MARK ARE ALREADY
TARGETS.

36:05.731 --> 36:14.306
YOU AND MARK ARE ALREADY
TARGETS.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.107
-
>> WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

36:16.141 --> 36:20.979
>> I GUESS UP THERE.

36:21.012 --> 36:26.252
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE -- I'M FINE
WITH BEING A PAWN.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.754
I DIDN'T OFFER IT.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.790
I KNOW WHAT THE AGENDA IS.

36:31.823 --> 36:39.731
BUT I FEEL LIKE --
>> YOU'RE NOT.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.432
YOU'RE NOT.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.633
LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU YOU'RE NOT.

36:41.667 --> 36:46.572
>> I WANT TO SAY THAT I TRUST
PAUL MORE THAN CODY RIGHT NOW.

36:46.605 --> 36:50.742
BUT HE'S SO SET ON ME GOING UP
ON BLOCK AS A PAWN.

36:50.776 --> 36:55.881
SO I'M IN A POSITION WHERE IF
SOMEBODY GOES WRONG THIS WEEK,

36:55.914 --> 37:04.523
I'M GO HOME.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.458
>> WHAT, BABY?

37:06.492 --> 37:13.131
>> WHAT'S UP?

37:13.164 --> 37:17.536
>> IF YOU GET PICKED TO PLAY
VETO AND WIN, WOULD YOU TAKE ME

37:17.569 --> 37:18.804
ON THE BLOCK?

37:18.837 --> 37:23.041
>> I WOULDN'T --
>> YOU WOULD BE ELIGIBLE.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.776
>> ABSOLUTELY.

37:24.810 --> 37:29.247
>> MARK AND ELENA, IT'S SO FUNNY
THAT YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT

37:29.281 --> 37:30.416
WORKING WITH CODY.

37:30.449 --> 37:35.854
BUT HERE YOU ARE IN THE SAME
ROOM CHATTING GAME BUT NOT

37:35.887 --> 37:37.255
WORKING WITH THEM.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.690
GET IT TOGETHER, BOOB.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.259
EVERYBODY SEES IT.

37:41.293 --> 37:52.137
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK WE
DON'T?

37:52.170 --> 37:56.608
>> IS THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPEN
SOMETHING MY OBSERVATION IS THAT

37:56.642 --> 37:57.909
CODY CAME IN AND TALKED GAME
WITH YOU.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.445
>> HOW IS IT GAME?

37:59.478 --> 38:01.347
>> DON'T PLAY ME WITH YOUR
QUESTION.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.249
>> SO ME HAVING MY NAME DRAGGED
THROUGH THE MUD WITH ALLEGATIONS

38:04.282 --> 38:07.853
OF BEING SOCIAL WITH CODY AND
JESS BECAUSE I'M A PERSON AND I

38:07.886 --> 38:10.622
LIKE THEM AS PEOPLE --
>> I DIDN'T SAY ANY OF THAT.

38:10.656 --> 38:14.760
>> YOU SAID I WAS TALKING GAME
WITH THEM.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.929
DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH
KITTY BOO BOO.

38:17.963 --> 38:18.730
COOL?

38:18.764 --> 38:21.299
>> EVERYBODY CAN DO THEIR OWN
THING.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.102
>> IF YOU'RE MAD ABOUT IT, I'M
SORRY.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.371
>> I'M NOT MAD.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.973
CLEARS UP A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT
MY NAME BEING THROWN AROUND LIKE

38:28.006 --> 38:28.306
THAT.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.207
THANK YOU.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.942
>> I DIDN'T THROW YOUR NAME
AROUND, HONEY.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.011
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE
HERE.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.547
>> TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT
I'M SUSPECT OF.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.349
THAT'S YOUR HOLE AGENDA, RIGHT?

38:37.383 --> 38:40.486
>> ANY TIME YOU DON'T HAVE THE
NUMBERS YOU FLIP.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.587
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

38:41.620 --> 38:45.624
>> I'M GLAD YOU HAVE THE SAFETY
THIS WEEK, HONEY.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.660
>> JUST GOOD TO KNOW WHO IS
THROWING MY NAME OUT THERE.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.963
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING SINCE CODY
DID THAT WHOLE THING.

38:51.997 --> 38:52.864
>> REALLY?

38:52.898 --> 38:54.966
YOU DIDN'T HAVE AN ALLIANCE WITH
CODY?

38:55.000 --> 38:55.567
>> NO.

38:55.601 --> 38:56.768
I TOLD EVERYBODY THE SAME.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.837
>> CODY --
>> BEFORE CODY --

38:58.870 --> 39:03.141
>> CODY, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR
YOU.

39:03.174 --> 39:03.709
CODY.

39:03.742 --> 39:04.042
CODY.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.176
OH, WAIT.

39:05.210 --> 39:09.681
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE BROS A

39:09.715 --> 39:10.949
GAME.

39:10.982 --> 39:14.252
>> MARK, IT'S THE SAME MOVE YOU
PULLED ON CODY, YOU JOINED THE

39:14.285 --> 39:14.786
NUMBERS.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.286
>> IT'S BULL .

39:15.320 --> 39:16.955
ALL RIGHT, NUMBERS.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.189
LET'S DO IT.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.926
LET CODY OUT.

39:20.959 --> 39:24.029
IF YOU FLIPPED ON YOUR CLOSEST
FRIENDS SINCE DAY ONE, WHO ELSE

39:24.062 --> 39:25.296
ARE YOU GOING TO FLIP ON?

39:25.330 --> 39:27.833
I'M NOT TAKING THAT RISK.

39:27.866 --> 39:31.670
>> YOU FLIP ANY TIME YOU SEE
YOU'RE IN THE MINORITY.

39:31.703 --> 39:32.971
IT'S LIKE A PAN CANE.

39:33.004 --> 39:36.608
>> MARK AND ELENA ARE
FLIP-FLOPPERS, WHEREVER THE

39:36.642 --> 39:39.945
HOUSE GOES, THEY FOLLOW.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.380
THEY'RE NOT LOYAL.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.350
>> I SHOULD HAVE VOTED YOU OUT
WEEK ONE.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.985
>> YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE
VOTES.

39:47.018 --> 39:47.986
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.320
>> I'M PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.522
IT'S VERY OBVIOUS.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.758
I'M GOING WHERE THE POWER IS
BECAUSE THIS IS "BIG BROTHER."

39:52.791 --> 39:55.126
GUESS WHAT, KITTY BOO BOO?

39:55.160 --> 39:59.130
I'M SAFE, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH
ME AND MY FLIP-FLOPPING FOR

39:59.164 --> 40:01.166
ANOTHER WEEK.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.333
>> THIS IS THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.135
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

40:37.168 --> 40:40.338
TWO HOUSE GUESTS FOR EVICTION.

40:40.371 --> 40:43.809
MATT, BECAUSE YOU CAME IN LAST
IN THE TEMPTATION COMPETITION,

40:43.842 --> 40:47.646
YOU'RE ALREADY ON THE BLOCK AS A
SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

40:47.679 --> 40:56.588
NOW IT IS TIME FOR ME TO REVEAL
MY TWO NOMINEES.

40:56.622 --> 41:04.029
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE GUESTS THAT I'M

41:04.062 --> 41:05.296
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

41:05.330 --> 41:09.501
LY TURN TWO KEYS AND THEIR FACES
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

41:09.535 --> 41:19.410
THE FIRST HOUSE GUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS -- THE NEXT HOUSE

41:19.444 --> 41:29.487
GUEST THAT I HAVE NOMINATED
IS --

41:29.487 --> 41:37.328
GUEST THAT I HAVE NOMINATED
IS --

41:37.362 --> 41:42.233
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ELENA AND
YOU, JASON, BECAUSE ELENA, THIS

41:42.267 --> 41:43.034
IS NOTHING PERSONAL.

41:43.068 --> 41:46.905
I REALLY SUPER LOVE YOU AND LIKE
YOU.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.675
IT'S JUST PART OF "BIG BROTHER."

41:49.708 --> 41:54.279
JASON, I PICKED YOU BECAUSE I
WANT TO COMPETE IN THE VETO WITH

41:54.312 --> 41:56.582
YOU.

41:56.615 --> 42:03.254
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

42:03.288 --> 42:06.324
>> I FEEL DISPOSABLE.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.325
WHAT'S UP?

42:07.358 --> 42:10.662
IS ANYTHING BUT WRONG, SO WE'LL
VOTE ELENA OUT.

42:10.696 --> 42:16.968
SO I NEED TO FOCUS ON WINNING
THE VETO COMPETITION AND

42:17.002 --> 42:19.738
GUARANTEEING MY SAFETY.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.540
>> I JUST PRAY THAT SHE WINS.

42:22.574 --> 42:26.544
I HAVE TO START AND KEEP PUTTING
IN PEOPLE'S MIND THAT PAUL IS

42:26.578 --> 42:27.746
GUNNING FOR THEM.

42:27.779 --> 42:32.651
I GO OUT THE WEEK AFTER JESS, I
WON'T BE HAPPY.

42:32.684 --> 42:36.154
I WANTED TO MAKE THIS CHANCE
WORTH:

42:36.187 --> 42:41.059
>> EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING IS SET
UP PERFECTLY TO GET CODY OUT,

42:41.092 --> 42:45.163
MAYBE THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO
GET ONE OF THOSE SHOWMANCES OUT.

42:45.196 --> 42:47.766
IF ELENA GOES HOME THAT WOULDN'T
BE BAD EITHER.
