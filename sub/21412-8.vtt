WEBVTT

00:04.664 --> 00:06.884
It's good to be back
in the old threads.

00:07.046 --> 00:09.001
Well, the old new threads.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.370
I gotta say, that black costume
was pretty cool.

00:12.665 --> 00:16.853
Up until I realized it was actually
alive and taking over my mind.

00:17.009 --> 00:19.017
Guess they should've
put that on the label.

00:19.126 --> 00:22.462
All joking aside, that thing
needs a warning label.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.376
Especially since Max
seems to have ignored my advice

00:25.430 --> 00:28.717
that the V-252 is too dangerous
to exhibit at the Stark Expo.

00:28.897 --> 00:31.678
But if he won't listen to me
as Peter Parker,

00:32.124 --> 00:35.432
then it looks like a job
for... Spider-Man!

00:35.658 --> 00:38.682
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01 Episode 08</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>" Stark Expo"</font>

00:39.478 --> 00:42.518
Wow. The Stark Expo.

00:42.705 --> 00:44.987
I still get chills
when I see that sign.

00:45.448 --> 00:47.588
Uncle Ben and I would
come to this every year.

00:47.745 --> 00:50.776
Once, I actually got
30 feet from Tony Stark.

00:51.455 --> 00:54.258
I never washed those feet again.

00:56.745 --> 00:58.520
Now that I'm here
with Horizon High,

00:58.597 --> 01:00.957
I'll have a front row seat
for when Stark unveils his new...

01:01.088 --> 01:04.557
Uh-oh. I know the Stark Expo
is a tough event to get into,

01:04.605 --> 01:07.065
but the roof
should not be an option.

01:07.532 --> 01:09.202
Whoa! Where'd he go?

01:10.547 --> 01:12.893
Creepy. But I'm guessing
he's just using

01:12.955 --> 01:15.330
the mirage reflectors they
unveiled at last year's expo.

01:15.529 --> 01:17.573
Hey, Ghost of Expos Past!

01:17.720 --> 01:20.560
If you're trying to get into the expo
ahead of the fans waiting in line,

01:20.674 --> 01:22.916
you're gonna have to go
through me first.

01:23.252 --> 01:26.205
Whoa!
He's taking me literally.

01:27.494 --> 01:30.360
Well, let's see how he feels
about a knuckle sandwich.

01:31.619 --> 01:33.135
Whoa!

01:33.254 --> 01:35.299
That's more than
a mirage reflector.

01:35.379 --> 01:38.073
Uh-oh. He must've shorted
my web shooters.

01:39.119 --> 01:40.526
Can I help you?

01:40.612 --> 01:41.909
Huh?

01:42.594 --> 01:43.999
Iron Man!

01:44.087 --> 01:45.197
Holy cow!

01:45.326 --> 01:47.166
Just like on
my collectors cups!

01:47.218 --> 01:50.330
Only taller, 'cause,
you know, they're cups.

01:50.479 --> 01:52.479
You're pretty excited
for an intruder.

01:52.604 --> 01:55.752
Intruder? No, no. I'm the guy
trying to stop the intru...

01:55.800 --> 01:58.635
Don't you know better than
to break into a tech expo?

01:58.721 --> 02:02.393
Every electronic security apparatus in
the place alerted me to your presence.

02:02.534 --> 02:04.698
What? No, it wasn't me.
It was...

02:04.832 --> 02:06.377
Talk to the hand.

02:06.699 --> 02:09.013
No. No, no, no, wait!

02:15.066 --> 02:19.088
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01 Episode 08</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>" Stark Expo"</font>

02:20.151 --> 02:21.784
This should be quick.

02:22.503 --> 02:24.335
He's trying to encase me...

02:24.677 --> 02:26.174
in an electric grid cage.

02:26.377 --> 02:29.276
Just like the one on my box
of Avengers Instant Oatmeal!

02:29.479 --> 02:31.339
Now with more iron.

02:31.797 --> 02:33.013
Ow!

02:33.729 --> 02:36.085
You're faster than I gave you
credit for, Spider-Man.

02:36.163 --> 02:38.900
That's because we have to move quick
if we're gonna catch the real...

02:38.947 --> 02:40.253
Wait.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.479
You... You know who I am?

02:42.604 --> 02:45.205
I'm aware of you. What I'm not
sure about is your intention,

02:45.307 --> 02:48.276
- which is why you're coming with me.
- Yow!

02:48.456 --> 02:50.331
He knows who I am!

02:50.518 --> 02:52.175
This is growing tiresome.

02:53.906 --> 02:56.042
I'm telling you,
I'm not the guy you're after.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.026
There's some sort
of ghost up here. He was...

02:58.096 --> 02:59.839
A ghost? Uh, nice try,

02:59.932 --> 03:02.612
but according to my readouts,
it's just me and you...

03:02.706 --> 03:05.956
A five-foot ten-inch,
97-pound...

03:06.253 --> 03:07.266
kid?

03:07.385 --> 03:08.667
Don't be so surprised.

03:08.715 --> 03:10.089
This place
is crawling with kids.

03:10.136 --> 03:12.417
Well, they're not all crawling.
Just me.

03:12.839 --> 03:14.511
And you know what they say.

03:14.682 --> 03:17.432
"He who crawls and leaps away
lives to fight another day."

03:17.620 --> 03:18.909
I hope!

03:20.225 --> 03:22.011
Clever, kid.

03:25.923 --> 03:27.987
While there's no doubt
Spider-Man is the best person

03:28.049 --> 03:30.276
to find this ghost character
and warn Max,

03:30.651 --> 03:33.393
some days you an accomplish more
just by being...

03:35.706 --> 03:37.839
another face in the crowd.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.917
Okay, okay.
One at a time.

03:41.292 --> 03:42.292
Wow!

03:42.361 --> 03:44.409
Can't believe we're all
finally here.

03:44.596 --> 03:48.432
Seems like everything we've worked for all
semester has led to this very moment.

03:48.690 --> 03:51.526
Don't think I've ever seen
so many geniuses under one roof.

03:51.964 --> 03:53.026
You're late.

03:53.151 --> 03:55.096
Would "hello" ever suffice?

03:55.214 --> 03:57.565
- No.
- Have you seen Max?

03:57.613 --> 04:00.776
He's over on the Horizon stage.
But I wouldn't bother him.

04:00.870 --> 04:04.057
The V-252 isn't stabilizing,
so he's bugging out.

04:04.182 --> 04:05.511
I'll keep that in mind.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.331
Maybe it'll help me
convince him not to use it.

04:08.643 --> 04:10.768
- Parker!
- Flash?

04:11.354 --> 04:14.182
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, I beg your pardon.

04:14.432 --> 04:16.791
This expo is for the
brightest of the bright,

04:16.909 --> 04:19.346
and I am representing
Midtown High

04:19.447 --> 04:22.471
with my
baking soda volcano.

04:22.706 --> 04:25.636
Sure, Midtown may have other
entries, but let's be honest.

04:25.776 --> 04:28.815
Nothing wins the day
like good old "papyer-matchy."

04:29.370 --> 04:31.143
That's great, Flash.

04:31.284 --> 04:34.417
I'm in a hurry,
but best of luck.

04:38.282 --> 04:40.626
- Step away from the door, sir.
- Huh?

04:41.094 --> 04:42.211
I was just...

04:42.259 --> 04:43.766
Step away from the door!

04:43.875 --> 04:46.422
Pete! He's with me.

04:46.501 --> 04:48.165
What's with the security?

04:48.868 --> 04:50.521
Just my dad being my dad.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.533
Pretty exciting day, huh?

04:52.586 --> 04:53.829
Yeah. No kidding.

04:53.938 --> 04:57.242
The program says Oz Academy
is exhibiting a Vulture Force?

04:57.290 --> 04:59.032
Come on.
Among other things.

04:59.195 --> 05:02.985
- Harry, that's enough talk.
- But, Dad...

05:03.243 --> 05:05.315
I said, "That's enough."

05:05.454 --> 05:07.301
I should get going anyway.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.571
Good luck today, Osborns.

05:09.735 --> 05:11.547
You, too, Pete.

05:12.054 --> 05:13.906
Do you have to be
so rude, Dad?

05:13.992 --> 05:18.031
- Pete's my best friend.
- And today, he's the competition.

05:18.203 --> 05:20.734
But everyone's about to see
our experiments anyway.

05:20.875 --> 05:25.304
And besides, I don't think I can
keep my glider a secret much longer.

05:25.398 --> 05:28.742
About that, son.
I've made a decision.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.797
I don't want you to enter your
glider into the competition.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.851
What? Why?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.828
It's perfect for the expo.

05:35.953 --> 05:37.492
I'm sorry, son.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.499
But Spider-Man's break-in
at Oz Academy got me thinking.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.304
We need tighter security.

05:42.397 --> 05:44.155
And now that we know
that Spider-Man

05:44.233 --> 05:46.288
has aligned himself
with Horizon High,

05:46.468 --> 05:49.905
it might be time Oz Academy had
someone protecting our interests.

05:50.163 --> 05:54.124
And your glider here could be the
first step towards such a figure.

05:54.272 --> 05:57.030
- But...
- Our conversation is over, Harry.

05:58.843 --> 06:01.593
Come on.
Come on.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.788
Problem, Max?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.702
A-ha! There! There!
I've got it.

06:06.772 --> 06:09.858
Now, if I can just
keep it stabilized long enough

06:09.944 --> 06:12.257
for the Stark representatives
to confirm my research,

06:12.335 --> 06:15.796
I'll be on my way to adding it
to the periodic table.

06:15.882 --> 06:17.991
Didn't you read the research
I gave you, Max?

06:18.077 --> 06:19.827
Very insightful.

06:19.936 --> 06:23.264
Then you know that the V-252
is alive.

06:23.624 --> 06:27.343
I actually found that part
debatable, Peter.

06:28.007 --> 06:29.514
Debatable? I-I...

06:29.819 --> 06:31.366
Can you show me
further proof?

06:31.483 --> 06:33.921
Because I had trouble
confirming your theory.

06:34.397 --> 06:38.116
What I was able to confirm, however,
is what I've always suspected.

06:38.225 --> 06:40.995
This substance,
when given the proper catalyst,

06:41.061 --> 06:43.350
can take the form
of whatever I program.

06:43.485 --> 06:44.913
Look at this.

06:45.771 --> 06:48.686
A hand. A foot.
You name it.

06:49.178 --> 06:51.952
It's not only versatile
but also impenetrable,

06:52.093 --> 06:55.483
and will revolutionize
the prosthetic industry.

06:55.608 --> 06:58.186
I'm telling you,
it's alive, Max.

06:58.546 --> 07:01.999
And exposing it to the world,
let alone the expo, is dangerous.

07:02.116 --> 07:04.561
Science is always
dangerous, kid.

07:04.865 --> 07:07.012
If it wasn't,
it would be called mini-golf.

07:07.084 --> 07:09.366
Tony... Stark!

07:09.585 --> 07:13.178
And if Max Modell here says
something's safe, then I believe him.

07:13.249 --> 07:16.389
How are you, Max? Very well.
Thanks, Tony.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.638
Allow me to introduce one of
my more passionate students,

07:19.998 --> 07:21.162
Peter Parker.

07:21.217 --> 07:22.873
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Stark!

07:22.928 --> 07:25.483
I own every issue of <i> Scientific
Magazine</i> with you on the cover!

07:25.545 --> 07:28.108
No need to yell, son.
I'm right here.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.975
Ooh. Gotta work
on that grip, kid.

07:34.045 --> 07:38.092
You're not helping debunk the myth that
scientists are 98-pound weaklings.

07:38.803 --> 07:40.424
I'm 97 pounds, actually.

07:40.865 --> 07:41.959
Hmm.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.428
Tony.

07:44.077 --> 07:46.162
Here we go.

07:46.506 --> 07:48.639
Norman.
You're looking well.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.452
Me? You should see
my Vulture Force.

07:51.584 --> 07:54.459
I assure you they will be
the highlight of the expo.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.311
I'm the highlight of the
expo, Norman. You should know that.

07:57.717 --> 07:59.139
In fact,
if you'll excuse me,

07:59.187 --> 08:02.116
I've got 30,000 screaming fans
to impress.

08:03.099 --> 08:07.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Stark Expo,

08:07.850 --> 08:10.366
the technological event
of the year.

08:10.414 --> 08:14.530
With your host, the technological
man of the millennium,

08:15.078 --> 08:17.991
Tony Stark!

08:23.710 --> 08:26.264
Thanks, everyone.
I'm sure you're all about

08:26.342 --> 08:29.327
to unveil some groundbreaking
technology here today.

08:29.506 --> 08:33.342
Let's be honest. You really came
to see the new suit. Am I right?

08:35.342 --> 08:37.020
Then I give you...

08:37.155 --> 08:39.756
♪♪

08:39.889 --> 08:42.291
The Mark 50!

08:46.722 --> 08:49.223
Tony
Stark is a selfish capitalist.

08:49.309 --> 08:50.464
Who said that?

08:51.870 --> 08:53.316
Sir, we have a breach.

08:53.768 --> 08:55.027
Already on it.

08:55.113 --> 08:57.051
But he's using an echo device.

08:57.215 --> 08:59.707
Can't pinpoint his location
just yet.

08:59.942 --> 09:02.433
Obsessed with being
a tech titan,

09:02.543 --> 09:04.965
Stark took control of my
ideas,

09:05.020 --> 09:07.512
and left me out in the cold.

09:07.659 --> 09:12.137
So now I've come
to take control of his ideas...

09:14.158 --> 09:18.238
and leave him
in the cold, hard ground.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.684
I don't think so.

09:25.254 --> 09:27.027
Somebody call for Spider-Man?

09:28.064 --> 09:30.629
Uh-oh. Still no tech.
I gotcha!

09:31.145 --> 09:32.299
Hopefully!

09:33.012 --> 09:35.231
Spider strength,
don't fail me now!

09:35.317 --> 09:38.332
- A little early ft you think?
- Iron Man?

09:38.418 --> 09:40.567
Now do you believe
there's someone else here?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.598
Attempting to save those
kids earned you some cred,

09:42.645 --> 09:45.416
but if you want my trust, you'll
help me take down your partner.

09:45.464 --> 09:47.003
He's not my partner!

09:47.083 --> 09:48.282
Then prove it.

09:48.398 --> 09:51.224
Easily... if my tech
was working.

09:51.722 --> 09:53.644
Better fix it fast.

09:55.828 --> 09:59.308
A boost from this static
generator should do the trick.

10:04.534 --> 10:07.675
Hope that did it.
Thanks, Calhoun High School.

10:08.987 --> 10:10.370
You're attacking me now?

10:10.459 --> 10:12.253
Great job proving you two
aren't partners.

10:12.301 --> 10:15.284
I'm telling you, I don't
even know who this guy is.

10:16.918 --> 10:19.362
His name is Ghost.
He's got a grudge against me.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.433
Which isn't good because he can
manipulate all forms of tech.

10:22.662 --> 10:24.787
Can even shut it down
by passing through it.

10:24.863 --> 10:27.581
Too bad we can't overpower his
circuits the way he did mine.

10:27.687 --> 10:32.386
That's not a bad idea. The Mark 50 has the
ability to control other suits remotely.

10:32.434 --> 10:37.014
But if I can reverse the signal
with an incoming charge...

10:40.749 --> 10:42.034
Good call, Spider-Man.

10:42.138 --> 10:44.839
- Maybe I was wrong about you.
- You fools!

10:44.887 --> 10:48.261
All I needed from that suit were
the interconnectivity disks.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.831
Or maybe I spoke too soon.

10:50.902 --> 10:53.222
Since you don't
seem to mind one man

10:53.270 --> 10:56.237
controlling all the tech
in the world, Mr. Stark,

10:56.287 --> 10:59.244
let's see how you feel
about one man controlling

10:59.292 --> 11:02.214
all the tech at your expo.

11:06.841 --> 11:09.253
Everyone, stay calm!

11:09.431 --> 11:12.839
Oz Academy Vulture Force,
attack!

11:12.948 --> 11:16.573
Norman, no! He's extended his
reach with my interconnectivity disks!

11:16.663 --> 11:19.284
Suit's not
responding to my commands.

11:19.744 --> 11:21.331
Whoa!

11:21.444 --> 11:24.379
He's gained control
of everything tech based!

11:25.251 --> 11:27.620
Take down what you can!

11:28.268 --> 11:29.448
Aah!

11:30.127 --> 11:33.354
No! No, no, no!

11:34.093 --> 11:37.268
Otto, Th-They're...
stuck!!

11:38.491 --> 11:40.628
We've got to retrieve
those disks.

11:40.676 --> 11:44.315
No problem. Just gotta
keep my eyes on the prize.

11:44.664 --> 11:45.964
Aahh!

11:46.287 --> 11:49.188
He's controlling the
optic lenses in my mask!

11:50.409 --> 11:51.737
Spider-Man, what are you doing?

11:51.785 --> 11:53.143
Sorry.
Lenses going haywire.

11:53.191 --> 11:55.026
He engaged my
night vision goggles!

11:55.105 --> 11:57.769
Tech is your enemy now,
Iron Man.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.003
Why not
take that armor off?

12:00.099 --> 12:02.894
I'd love a shot
at your arc reactor.

12:03.004 --> 12:04.519
Not a chance!

12:04.567 --> 12:07.042
Then experience
what it feels like

12:07.090 --> 12:09.628
to have no control!

12:09.721 --> 12:11.683
My solar flares are charging.

12:11.762 --> 12:13.901
They're what? Aahh!

12:14.054 --> 12:15.690
I can't see!

12:15.937 --> 12:18.159
Spider-Man, grab him
before he can...

12:18.573 --> 12:20.003
Lenses enhanced the glare.

12:20.051 --> 12:21.738
I've got him, Spidey!

12:22.068 --> 12:25.152
Watch out!
He has control of my arms!

12:27.059 --> 12:29.332
Oh. Thank you, Spider-Man.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.441
- Harry?
- Get to safety, Max!

12:31.566 --> 12:33.074
But where's Spider-Man?

12:33.155 --> 12:36.114
Still can't see. Iron Man,
I've hacked into your frequency.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.343
We need to work together
if we're going to stop Ghost.

12:38.574 --> 12:40.136
Agreed. I'll be your eyes.

12:40.246 --> 12:43.138
He's at your 9:00.
Hit him now!

12:45.318 --> 12:47.863
- You'll regret that!
- Whoa!

12:48.199 --> 12:49.910
That was just
the break we needed.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.769
Plus my eyesight's
coming back.

12:51.817 --> 12:53.457
Get me closer
to those kids!

12:54.253 --> 12:55.683
Grab my hand.

12:55.814 --> 12:57.699
I'm sorry.
That wasn't what...

12:57.747 --> 13:00.301
He's in control of my armor again!

13:06.824 --> 13:08.261
It won't stop attacking!

13:08.359 --> 13:09.699
Look out!

13:10.840 --> 13:11.957
Got it!

13:12.014 --> 13:14.324
That ghost can't control it
if it doesn't have power.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.472
- Good move.
- Have to rely on things

13:16.520 --> 13:17.719
he can't manipulate,

13:17.766 --> 13:19.465
like my Spider-Sense!

13:19.581 --> 13:21.082
Iron Man?

13:22.441 --> 13:25.215
Sorry, kid. I'm not in control.
Only have one way to stop this...

13:25.317 --> 13:27.246
Eject!

13:28.083 --> 13:30.808
Finally.
Now, let's get

13:30.867 --> 13:33.136
to the <i> heart</i> of the matter.

13:33.527 --> 13:36.441
- My arc reactor!
- Iron Man!

13:36.573 --> 13:39.699
Have to break Ghost's control
of Iron Man before he kills him!

13:39.799 --> 13:42.082
But everything in
this place is tech.

13:42.459 --> 13:44.340
Almost everything.

13:44.988 --> 13:49.035
After it took over my mind, I swore
I'd never put this thing on again.

13:50.237 --> 13:52.129
Spider-Man...

13:52.317 --> 13:54.746
But Tony's life
is at stake.

14:00.427 --> 14:02.808
No! It is alive!

14:09.597 --> 14:13.332
Time to finish you
once and for all, Spider-Man.

14:13.569 --> 14:15.427
Spider-Man...

14:16.877 --> 14:18.816
If this isn't
an ad for going organic,

14:18.864 --> 14:20.879
I don't know what is.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:32.715 --> 14:34.150
How's it...

14:34.230 --> 14:36.746
I have control
over everything!

14:36.794 --> 14:38.794
Everything tech based.

14:42.034 --> 14:43.440
And that's all I need

14:43.498 --> 14:45.289
to destroy you.

14:45.444 --> 14:48.394
My Sonic Scream's
been activated!

14:50.972 --> 14:52.519
Stop it!

14:52.682 --> 14:54.816
Symbiote coming apart!

14:55.433 --> 14:59.246
So, something does affect you.

15:03.691 --> 15:07.543
So much for your Symbiote.

15:10.207 --> 15:11.829
What?

15:16.238 --> 15:18.465
- How?
- How?

15:18.629 --> 15:22.363
Let's just say that when you push
people too far, they get enraged.

15:22.411 --> 15:25.082
And rage is a powerful...
motivator.

15:27.255 --> 15:30.363
Give up these disks, now!

15:34.533 --> 15:37.691
And one more thing...
Apologize!

15:39.105 --> 15:41.371
Spider-Man, stop!

15:41.523 --> 15:43.426
Let security take it from here.

15:43.524 --> 15:47.343
- Aww! You ruined my big finish, T.S.
- Aah!

15:47.488 --> 15:50.808
Spider-Man, you need to take
that suit off right now.

15:50.919 --> 15:53.670
- It's alive.
- Alive?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.613
I thought you wanted it to become
an element on the periodic table.

15:56.769 --> 15:58.144
I did.

15:58.551 --> 16:03.465
I was caught up in the glory of it
all, but now I know it's not safe.

16:03.717 --> 16:06.379
Maybe you're just not
the right person to control it.

16:06.605 --> 16:08.551
Maybe it takes
someone awesome.

16:08.599 --> 16:12.136
Spider-Man, when Ghost
was an employee of mine,

16:12.233 --> 16:14.238
he did have incredible ideas,

16:14.413 --> 16:18.363
but I took them from him because
he lost sight of their impact.

16:18.472 --> 16:20.640
He wasn't acting responsibly.

16:20.803 --> 16:24.636
And I have to wonder if you're
heading into similar territory.

16:24.778 --> 16:26.744
Changing your suit is one thing,

16:26.860 --> 16:29.340
but changing your moral compass
is another.

16:29.631 --> 16:32.347
You're right.
I've gotta get this thing off.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.678
But I can't do it alone,

16:34.974 --> 16:38.457
and with the Sonic Scream devices
destroyed, I don't know how.

16:38.664 --> 16:42.324
Let me take a crack at it, Spidey.
I can pull it off.

16:42.420 --> 16:45.660
I appreciate the gesture, but
it'll take more than just you.

16:45.740 --> 16:49.504
Why don't we do it... together?

16:49.627 --> 16:51.871
If I've learned anything
on the Avengers,

16:51.956 --> 16:54.980
it's that we're at our strongest
as a team.

16:56.572 --> 17:01.009
- Who's ready... to Assemble?
- Yeah, let's do this!

17:02.402 --> 17:04.720
- Ready?
- Pull!

17:12.617 --> 17:13.931
Huh?

17:15.165 --> 17:18.204
That thing just gave me
the evil eye.

17:21.258 --> 17:22.587
It's loose!

17:22.635 --> 17:23.673
Huh?

17:23.721 --> 17:25.196
Get clear!

17:27.967 --> 17:30.275
- Everyone get back!
- I got it!

17:31.373 --> 17:34.978
Ahh. Good to be
in control again.

17:36.734 --> 17:38.368
Nice teamwork,
everyone.

17:38.416 --> 17:41.907
Hey, anything to help out Spider...
Man?

17:43.574 --> 17:45.439
What...
He's just leaving?

17:45.591 --> 17:48.323
- Sir, should we pursue him?
- No.

17:48.524 --> 17:50.245
Let him go.

17:52.151 --> 17:53.956
Nice assist, Otto.

17:54.182 --> 17:58.565
Thank you, Max. And I'm sorry
about attacking you before.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.948
Once I've connected the arms
to the cerebral cortex

18:02.016 --> 18:03.643
and not a battery source,

18:03.729 --> 18:06.292
it won't ever be vulnerable
to hacking again.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.846
Otto, I don't think you should
continue working on those arms

18:10.032 --> 18:13.684
until I have a better understanding
of their advanced capability.

18:13.776 --> 18:15.112
What? Why?

18:15.160 --> 18:17.104
- I know enough to complete...
- I'm sorry, Otto.

18:17.151 --> 18:20.362
Either you continue your research
at a pace I'm comfortable with,

18:20.471 --> 18:22.409
or I'm pulling your funding.

18:22.592 --> 18:25.120
Your school, your rules.

18:25.482 --> 18:27.159
Have it your way.

18:27.684 --> 18:29.245
Peter, where
have you been?

18:29.323 --> 18:32.573
I, uh, got trapped
underneath some of that debris.

18:32.774 --> 18:35.058
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

18:35.229 --> 18:38.479
Look, I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

18:38.932 --> 18:41.721
You were right
and I was wrong.

18:41.975 --> 18:44.455
And to make it up to you,
I'm lifting your punishment

18:44.503 --> 18:47.182
for taking the V-252
in the first place.

18:47.464 --> 18:49.815
Your work here at the expo
will be reflected

18:49.863 --> 18:51.948
- in your overall grade.
- Thank you, Max.

18:51.996 --> 18:56.565
Hey, speaking of grades, who is
the winner of the expo anyway?

18:56.877 --> 18:59.784
Good question.
Mr. Stark, who gets the prize?

18:59.979 --> 19:02.589
Well, considering it is
the only thing still standing,

19:02.702 --> 19:04.628
I guess the winner is...

19:05.268 --> 19:07.832
Flash Thompson's papier-mâché
volcano.

19:07.909 --> 19:09.417
Yeah!

19:09.681 --> 19:13.386
In your face,
eggheads! Oh, yeah!

19:14.974 --> 19:19.745
I mean, um, I humbly accept
this great honor.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.714
Oh, yeah.

19:25.275 --> 19:27.096
Well done.
Great job, Flash.

19:27.144 --> 19:28.673
Way to go, Flash.

19:28.721 --> 19:31.647
- What a waste.
- Dad...

19:33.323 --> 19:34.970
I'm sorry I overreacted

19:35.018 --> 19:36.948
when you said
I couldn't enter my glider.

19:37.019 --> 19:40.393
If I had, it would have been destroyed
along with everything else.

19:40.564 --> 19:42.800
Maybe it is meant
for greater things.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.706
Then we didn't lose
here today after all, Harry.

19:45.980 --> 19:48.362
We gained something
even more valuable...

19:49.742 --> 19:51.261
Clarity.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.151
Max, I'm taking this substance
back to Avengers Compound.

19:55.284 --> 19:58.115
Something this powerful needs to
be under secure lock and key.

19:58.276 --> 20:00.518
Huh. No argument here.

20:00.685 --> 20:02.862
Mr. Parker, it was a
pleasure to meet you.

20:03.034 --> 20:04.628
Max says you have
a lot of potential,

20:04.688 --> 20:06.542
and as always,
I believe him.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.980
Thanks.

20:09.081 --> 20:11.095
I wish I was
a gooey black substance.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.886
I could go back to Avengers
Compound with you.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.636
Yeah. I'm gonna leave now.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.464
Oh! I meant
to get his autograph!

20:20.611 --> 20:24.034
Really? You don't think
one awkward moment is enough?

20:26.804 --> 20:30.432
That is quite an impressive
contraption you have there.

20:30.659 --> 20:34.425
Huh. Yeah.
A lot of good it'll do me.

20:34.698 --> 20:37.933
Well, I happen to know where you
might find some additional funding,

20:38.183 --> 20:39.891
if needed.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.121
Mr. Stark!

20:43.457 --> 20:47.855
I meant to ask. Could you
autograph my expo program?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.220
Sure, kid.

20:49.268 --> 20:51.644
Too bad Spider-Man
ran off so fast.

20:51.777 --> 20:54.812
You could've gotten the autograph
of two heroes instead of one.

20:55.535 --> 20:57.910
You really think
Spiderman is here.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.090
I think he's on his way.

21:00.214 --> 21:02.449
He just needs some guidance.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.900
You know how it is.
You've got Max as your mentor.

21:05.126 --> 21:09.676
I'd like to think Spider-Man knows
he can call on Iron Man in the same way.

21:09.972 --> 21:12.019
I'm sure he does.

21:12.348 --> 21:14.683
Well, keep up
those studies.

21:14.775 --> 21:17.634
And, uh, lift a barbell
or something, will ya?

21:17.695 --> 21:20.746
I can't be the only
science stud around here.

21:21.511 --> 21:22.716
Will do.

21:26.066 --> 21:27.449
"To Paul"?

21:27.636 --> 21:31.027
Aah! It's Peter!
