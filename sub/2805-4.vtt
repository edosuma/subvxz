Found on the corner of
Linden and Central in Bushwick.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.507
Cause of death was
a gunshot wound to the sternum.

He bled out instantly.

The subject is still unidentifiable.

Fifteen days have passed,

01:05.983 --> 01:09.278
and we are no closer
to figuring out who did this and why.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.407
The working theory stands
that Agent Siegel was a victim

01:13.490 --> 01:16.118
of an indiscriminate mugging gone wrong.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.621
His wallet and firearm are still missing.

all of its resources

01:26.837 --> 01:31.341
But the truth is,
we had caseloads beforehand,

01:31.425 --> 01:34.595
and those caseloads
still need to be resolved.

01:34.678 --> 01:39.391
So the joint operation center
will remain in this building,

01:39.474 --> 01:43.437
and a team of agents
will continue to pursue all leads.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.690
The remainder of you
will resume your active assignments.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.987

is by doing our jobs.

had $2 million in cash in it.

11:53.172 --> 11:55.674
What, you and Mr. Epstein
are the only employees here?

11:55.757 --> 11:58.385
(CHUCKLES) Look, I know you have
those financial packages to work on,

11:58.468 --> 12:01.138
but this man takes precedence.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.933
Mr. Wilcox is
a premier importer and exporter

12:05.017 --> 12:08.103
up and down the East Coast,
and he'd like to open an account.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.354
He would.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.106
That means start-up papers.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.816
That isn't protocol. We have a system.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.569
-You better make this work.
-Very good, Mr. Wilcox.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.530
I've been here for five years,
you've been here for five seconds.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.199
Start-up paperwork.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.993
Third office,
down the hall, left-hand side.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.162
Of course. Of course. I'll be right back.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.878
All right. Vault number four.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.255
-Keep a lookout.
-Yeah.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.468
Technically I should get a court order
to go through that computer.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.095
Good thing your CI doesn't need one.

12:43.847 --> 12:44.848
Neal.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.852
There are 250 clients in this database.
Narrowing it down by vault number.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.480
I found it.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.524
Vault number four.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.944
That's strange.
It's not registered to a person.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.364
-To what, then?
-To a corporation. Niteowl Holdings.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.573
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much, sir.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.783
That's good enough. Go.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.420
MANAGER: Louis!

13:15.879 --> 13:19.383
It's a dummy corp.
Someone is using Niteowl as a front.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.427
Whoever Griffith stole from
covered their identity nicely.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.512
Mmm-hmm.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.223
Gentlemen, I got a lead
on those marked bills.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.767
Two months ago,
a Manhattan Mutual truck was cleaned out.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.477
Now it's the bank's policy
to mark all currency

13:30.561 --> 13:32.187
in case any kind of theft occurs.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.648
NYPD had a suspect,
just couldn't nail him.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.942
PETER: Shane Jacoby. Priors for assault.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.486
And likely CEO of Niteowl Holdings.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.947
So Griffith and Jacoby
don't know each other, but they're linked.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.073
How?

13:47.411 --> 13:49.162
I might've found that link.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.416
Shane Jacoby received
a court-ordered treatment

13:52.499 --> 13:56.461
from a psychiatrist
who prescribed Griffith his meds.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.130
Dr. Mara Summers.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.596
DR. SUMMERS: There are five
common stages to ICD,

14:06.972 --> 14:09.725
beginning with the impulse
and ending with guilt.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.101
Or lack thereof.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.145
It is that final...

14:13.228 --> 14:15.439
This is an interesting area of expertise.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.274
Yeah, I can see why Griffith went to her.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.111
I found the patient
who experiences guilt from his actions

14:21.195 --> 14:25.282
is most likely to fall back
into the original destructive pattern.

14:25.616 --> 14:26.742
This is generally the case

14:26.825 --> 14:30.954
with the bulk of reformed criminals
I've worked with in my studies.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.041
More on that in tomorrow's lecture.
Thank you all for coming.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.210
(ALL APPLAUDING)

14:38.462 --> 14:42.257
She's got clients prone to commit crimes,
and she's got access to their heads.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.634
She could be manipulating them.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.636
Or she could just be doing her job.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.012
MAN 1: Dr. Summers, thank you.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.848
Only one way to find out.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.808
-MAN 2: Excellent, thank you.
-Thank you.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.310
Dr. Summers.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.855
-I'm sorry, you are...
-My name's Neal Caffrey.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.983
I'm a convicted felon,
and I need your help.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.450
Your work and research on ICD
is impressive, to say the least.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.953
I have a predilection for its study.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.497
Well, Dr. Summers,
this is the man I told you about, Peter.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.790
My parole officer.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.708
How long have you been
keeping an eye on Mr. Caffrey?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.335
Eternally, some might say.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.586
I have to be honest.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.256
Most of my work with reformed criminals
is pro bono.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.008
Right now I simply don't have time
to take on any new patients.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.010
(CHUCKLES)
I'm not asking you for a free session.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.054
-I'm expensive.
-Won't be a problem.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.640
Peter, would you mind briefly
giving Dr. Summers my resume?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.475
Briefly? Right.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.812
Well, Neal's been convicted
of bond forgery.

15:36.895 --> 15:41.233
He's also been implicated in over
four dozen works of counterfeit art.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.819
And there's also the fact
that he's still a suspect

15:43.902 --> 15:47.573
in several ongoing high-profile
federal investigations.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.867
-For what, exactly?
-Pick something.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.326
Bottom line,

15:51.618 --> 15:53.370
money may not be a problem
for a guy like me.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.454
I didn't hear that.

15:55.831 --> 15:59.668
-My office, 1:00 tomorrow.
-I look forward to working with you.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.213
Nice job.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.511
Two criminals, same psychiatrist.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.389
I think she's looking after herself
more than her clientele.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.893
It's possible she had a patient
steal from another patient,

16:15.976 --> 16:18.478
but it's the how of all this
that bothers me.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.273
You can't put the idea of a heist
in someone's head

16:21.356 --> 16:23.025
without them knowing about it.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.695
Peter, it's not that odd.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.573
-Think of a number between one and ten.
-No, I hate it when you do this.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.951
Just think of a number.
Two, three, four, five, whatever.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.453
-You got it?
-Yup.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.748
Now say it out loud in your head.
"Seven, seven, seven," for example.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.791
I know what you're doing.
It's not seven, Neal.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.376
No, it's nine.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.087
Okay, how did you do that?

16:44.213 --> 16:47.174
Before I asked you to think of a number,
I used the word "odd" in a sentence.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.300
So naturally, you'll choose an odd number.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.384
Then?

16:49.468 --> 16:51.136
Then I made your mind
subtly cross off options

16:51.220 --> 16:53.972
by saying "two, three, four, five"
and "seven" aloud.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.058
Which leaves the numbers one and nine.

16:56.183 --> 16:59.019
And nobody chooses one
because it's too obvious.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.896
Nine is more obscure,
so that's what you go with.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.315
That's good.
Okay, but the point of all this.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.485
In less than 20 seconds,
I got you to the number I wanted.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.819
Now think of Griffith and Summers.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.154
With that much time and influence,

17:09.238 --> 17:11.573
she could make him do
anything she wanted.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.700
-This guy's innocent.
-(PETER SIGHS)

17:14.743 --> 17:16.119
I need more, Neal.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.204
When you're with Summers,

17:17.287 --> 17:21.500
find something tangible that links
her or Griffith to Jacoby's cash.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.668
What are you gonna do?

17:22.751 --> 17:24.753
I've got Shane Jacoby's work address.

17:24.837 --> 17:25.838
I'm gonna go down there

17:25.921 --> 17:29.091
and see if I can find a connection
between him and Niteowl Holdings.

17:29.675 --> 17:31.468
Neal, be careful.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.596
I do not want this therapist
getting inside your head.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.016
-(CHUCKLES) Please. I'm a wall.
-Really?

17:43.897 --> 17:46.567
Tell me, what kind of change
are you looking to make with your life?

17:48.193 --> 17:51.405
I guess I'm looking for some normalcy.
Thank you.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.032
And what if that's not possible?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.242
(CHUCKLES)

17:55.868 --> 17:57.786
That doesn't sound very encouraging.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.162
I'm not here to encourage you.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.373
I'm here to help you discover
the truth about yourself,

18:01.456 --> 18:02.958
so you can accept it.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.295
I have to accept that I can't be normal?

18:07.171 --> 18:09.256
You're too interesting to be normal.

18:10.174 --> 18:12.342
What makes me so interesting?

18:13.969 --> 18:15.929
Your pathological assumption
that you need to be

18:16.013 --> 18:18.432
the smartest person in the room
at all times.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.935
Maybe you're the one assuming things.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.313
According to
all these diplomas on your wall,

18:24.396 --> 18:25.772
you're a lot smarter than me,

18:25.856 --> 18:28.734
but then again,
those are just papers, not people.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.695
-Do you think you're good with people?
-No more than you.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.197
-It's my job.
-Mine, too.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.492
You have an aggressive approach.

18:37.576 --> 18:41.121
And you're already withholding.
But that's natural.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.708
We need to know one another better
to build trust.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.878
-You don't think I'm being honest?
-Not yet.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.423
But you will be. In time.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.888
Mr. Jacoby. Peter Burke, FBI.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.932
What do you want?

19:00.140 --> 19:03.227
I'd like to talk to you
regarding your vault at Kaplan Security.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.104
Don't know what you're talking about.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.398
Okay, let's try that again.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.442
Where were you
on September 4th of this year?

19:11.276 --> 19:14.863
NYPD tried to pin that truck on me.
They had nothing. Same as you.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.240
All right, all right, calm down.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.951
-I don't like accusations.
-Then you shouldn't be a criminal.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.953
I especially don't like that accusation.

19:21.161 --> 19:26.041
It's not an accusation. It's a fact.
Read your rap sheet. Aggravated assault.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.378
You busted the nose of a security guard
and three of his fingers.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.090
That's not who I am anymore.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.551
Tell me about Niteowl Holdings.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.720
Never heard of that either.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.681
You're talking to the wrong guy,
Agent Burke.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.476
That's doubtful, but one more question.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.230
How did those court-ordered
anger management sessions go

19:48.313 --> 19:49.731
with Dr. Mara Summers?

19:51.692 --> 19:55.487
Either take me in on something,
or let me get on with my day.

19:56.488 --> 19:57.614
Nice hat.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.033
You went to Brooklyn Residential High.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.327
What sport did you play?

20:02.411 --> 20:04.454
All-state in wrestling. Are we done?

20:04.538 --> 20:05.539
Mmm.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.792
Not quite, but you can get on
with your day now, Mr. Jacoby.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.920
You know that vault
that was in Kaplan Security,

20:12.004 --> 20:14.715
the one with the
$2 million dollars cash in it?

20:15.132 --> 20:16.258
It's all gone now.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.093
But you knew that.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.679
Oh, you didn't know that.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.432
Well, now you do. Have a good day.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.268
-DR. SUMMERS: Job.
-Confined.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.853
-Jealousy.
-Weak.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.146
-Money.
-Prop.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.939
-Women.
-Hope.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.316
-Peter.
-Worthy.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.484
-Theft.
-(SCOFFS) Capable.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.694
-Caught.
-Oops.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.325
-You make something from that?
-It's too early to diagnose.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.368
But you've got something.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.830
Your answers are unique in summation.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.710
I assure you I can handle it, Doctor.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.131
Your behavior is sociopathic.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.383
(LAUGHS) I'm sorry?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.177
You work on perception,
the perception of others.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.929
How you think they'll feel.

21:02.012 --> 21:06.433
This influences your actions and thoughts
more so than your own emotions.

21:06.558 --> 21:11.313
Deceit and manipulation are the essential
characteristics of the disorder.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.689
You excel at both.

21:12.773 --> 21:16.318
Deceit and manipulation are generalities
that can apply to anyone who lies,

21:16.401 --> 21:18.487
and everyone lies,
including you, Dr. Summers.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.906
That may be true,
but not everyone believes their own lies.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.116
Why would I delude myself?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.911
Because you don't want anyone
to see your vulnerabilities.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.664
I don't strike you as confident.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.333
Confident people admit to their flaws.
You don't.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.418
Instead, you smile, a lot.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.798
You're confident. What are your flaws?

21:39.591 --> 21:42.761
I can be aggressive,
like you pointed out earlier.

21:43.512 --> 21:46.431
I also pick at my nails
when I get nervous.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.268
-Nobody's perfect.
-Precisely.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.395
The harder a person fights to be perfect,

21:51.478 --> 21:54.439
the more he suppresses his true nature.

21:54.523 --> 21:56.608
(SIGHS) I...

21:56.984 --> 21:59.152
-I'm reformed.
-Are you?

22:00.279 --> 22:02.531
Just because a person
starts doing good things

22:02.614 --> 22:04.741
doesn't mean
he wants to stop doing bad things.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.201
Of course not.

22:06.285 --> 22:09.705
Because everyone has done something bad
at some point in their life, even you.

22:09.788 --> 22:10.831
This is not about me.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.791
I thought confident people
could admit to their flaws.

22:12.875 --> 22:13.876
-You're redirecting.
-So are you.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.002
Because you're uncomfortable.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.837
You don't think that I can change.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.173
(ECHOING) I'm asking
if you really want to.

I have a few more questions for you.

22:31.852 --> 22:34.438
-(BREATHING HEAVILY) What's happening?
-We're using a new form of therapy.

to simply tell me the truth

(NEAL EXHALES SHARPLY)

23:10.557 --> 23:11.683
What happened?

23:11.767 --> 23:14.311
We began to practice
hypnotherapy technique.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.981
You were out for quite some time.
You had trouble waking.

23:18.857 --> 23:19.983
(EXHALES) Are you sure?

23:22.194 --> 23:25.864
Perhaps you could use something to eat
or a glass of water.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.159
No, I should go.

23:29.368 --> 23:33.580
-Would you like me to call you a cab?
-No. No. I'm fine.

-Peter.
-Yeah.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.467
Got this from Brooklyn

The year Jacoby graduated.

23:48.262 --> 23:49.638
That's him.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.640
That's the team that won all-state.
The Owls.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.809
I remembered the mascot
when I saw his hat.

23:53.892 --> 23:56.854
Championship year for the Owls,
led by team captain Shane Jacoby.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.064
Known for his aggressive takedowns
and late-night practices,

23:59.147 --> 24:00.607
earning him the nickname the Night Owl.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.943
And there is our link to Niteowl Holdings.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.988
Call NYPD,
have our nostalgic friend brought in.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.489
Sounds good.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.325
-Summers is onto me.
-What are you talking about? How?

24:10.409 --> 24:13.120
I don't know,
but she dosed me with something.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.289
She got me to talk,
I can't even remember what I said to her.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.582
I passed out.

-No, I have no idea.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.002
She must've slipped it into my water.

we have enough
to arrest Summers right now.

If we bring her in now,

24:25.465 --> 24:27.009
there's a good chance
we won't find the money she stole.

Griffith won't be cleared.

24:28.177 --> 24:30.846
Griffith. That's how she made you.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.308
Yeah, I saw Dr. Summers again.

24:34.391 --> 24:37.060

Looks like he went off-grid.

It's most likely
what Summers spiked your drink with.

25:40.958 --> 25:43.210
Very popular
with the working girls of Rio.

-You've heard them or have them?
-What's the difference?

25:47.756 --> 25:50.050
The difference is
you've been using my towels.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.930
-What did you put in my fridge?
-Oh, I made some hongeo.

25:55.013 --> 25:57.933
-Can you please unmake it?
-It's a delicacy.

It's a rotted Korean skate fish.
Fantastic with, um, kimchi and rice wine.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.485
All right, if you are gonna live here,
you can no longer cook here.

-Jealous of my refined palate?
-I am surprised that one even exists.

26:12.656 --> 26:14.741
Goodnight Cinderella. You were saying.

26:14.908 --> 26:19.746
Oh! It's a combination of GHB,
ketamine and flunitrazepam.

while under the influence. Um...

Empty out their bank accounts,
hand them the keys to their car.

don't recall anything happening.

to having too much fun.

that Summers used?

One of the few certainties in life

33:35.182 --> 33:38.227
Griffith. Will the FBI prosecute?

33:39.228 --> 33:40.854
They will soon.

33:40.938 --> 33:43.732
That's good, Neal. Stay focused.

33:47.194 --> 33:49.196
After that, she stood up.

33:49.947 --> 33:51.031
Where did she go?

33:53.367 --> 33:54.660
To make a phone call.

33:54.952 --> 33:55.994
Who did she call?

33:58.914 --> 34:02.209
I saw the number she dialed.
It was a 212 area code.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.586
<i>Three fives.</i>

34:08.507 --> 34:09.508
Zero, one.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.053
Two more digits, Neal.

34:15.722 --> 34:16.890
<i>Zero, one.</i>

34:18.517 --> 34:20.102
Eight, four.

34:20.519 --> 34:21.562
Nice work.

34:22.479 --> 34:24.523
Let's find out who she called.

34:24.606 --> 34:25.816
(LINE RINGING)

34:25.899 --> 34:27.818
(OVER VOICEMAIL)
<i>This is Jacoby. Leave a message.</i>

34:28.986 --> 34:30.696
She called Shane Jacoby.

34:30.779 --> 34:31.989
Neal, we're gonna have to...

34:33.115 --> 34:34.575
Grab you a blanket.

34:35.659 --> 34:36.994
I'll take him.

34:37.703 --> 34:38.829
What, are you gonna carry him?

34:39.121 --> 34:41.248
I'll have you know
I've been doing a lot of wrist curls.

34:41.331 --> 34:43.834
You've done plenty. I'll take care of him.

34:43.959 --> 34:44.960
(PHONE BEEPS)

34:45.752 --> 34:47.129
Jones. Hey.

34:47.379 --> 34:50.841
I want to see Griffith tomorrow,
and I'm gonna need you to come with me.

34:57.556 --> 34:58.557
(DOORBELL RINGING)

35:03.645 --> 35:06.440
-Now's not really a good time.
-Make time.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.526
You don't know Shane Jacoby.

35:10.277 --> 35:13.739
-I told you guys, no, I don't.
-Well, he may know about you.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.158
Summers made contact with him yesterday.

35:17.576 --> 35:19.661
I've told you everything that I can.

35:20.412 --> 35:22.748
I'm really sorry, guys,
but you're gonna have to leave.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.708
I have to pick up my kid from school.

35:31.715 --> 35:32.716
(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING)

35:39.056 --> 35:41.308
Just had to follow up on this.

35:41.767 --> 35:44.728
We're doing everything we can
to figure out what's going on here.

35:45.062 --> 35:48.899
You don't waste our time, Mr. Griffith,
we won't waste yours.

35:49.233 --> 35:51.777
-I'm telling you the truth.
-I believe you.

35:51.944 --> 35:55.155
And I know that you have to see your kid,
so we'll be on our way.

35:55.989 --> 35:58.575
If anything should come up,
you make sure you call us.

35:58.659 --> 35:59.910
-(DOOR OPENS)
-You got it?

35:59.993 --> 36:02.037
Yeah, yeah. Got it.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.289
-We'll be in touch.
-(DOOR SHUTS)

36:09.628 --> 36:11.588
All right, they're gone.

36:16.218 --> 36:19.346
-Daddy, what's happening?
-It's okay, buddy.

36:20.806 --> 36:22.015
Back up.

36:24.476 --> 36:26.603
Yeah, he'll be okay.

36:27.521 --> 36:29.606
As soon as you tell me
where you stashed my 2 million.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.943
-Otherwise...
-Otherwise, what?

36:33.735 --> 36:37.155
You put your hands in the air
and let go of that kid now.

36:37.906 --> 36:41.326
-Peter, you good?
-Yeah, I'm good. Get him out of here.

36:42.661 --> 36:45.080
Remember when I said we weren't done?

36:45.330 --> 36:46.331
(CHUCKLES)

36:48.625 --> 36:49.626
(GROANS)

36:52.671 --> 36:53.755
Now we're done.

37:01.972 --> 37:03.223
All right, the first time out,

37:03.307 --> 37:05.726
Summers manipulates Griffith
to steal from Jacoby.

37:05.809 --> 37:09.313
Then she turns it around.
She steers Jacoby towards Griffith.

37:09.396 --> 37:10.647
It makes sense on her part.

37:10.731 --> 37:12.858
Jacoby tries to kill Griffith,
lands himself in jail,

37:12.941 --> 37:14.484
and she walks with the money.

37:14.985 --> 37:18.071
There's still no physical evidence
pointing toward Summers.

37:18.155 --> 37:19.907
Only psychological manipulation.

37:20.490 --> 37:22.159
-What's our best option?
-(SIGHS)

37:22.492 --> 37:25.078
Find the money,
which is probably well hidden,

37:25.162 --> 37:28.624
or get a confession out of Summers,
which is all the more unlikely.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.335
Not necessarily.

37:32.711 --> 37:33.921
There's always a solution.

37:37.508 --> 37:39.635
DR. SUMMERS:
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

37:40.135 --> 37:41.762
I got a new perspective on things.

37:41.929 --> 37:43.180
Tell me about that.

37:43.263 --> 37:47.309
Well, I can admit that I don't know
if I can control my natural impulses,

37:47.392 --> 37:51.688
but that lack of control
doesn't make me feel helpless.

37:52.397 --> 37:54.733
How does it make you feel, then?

37:56.068 --> 37:57.152
Free.

37:57.736 --> 38:01.448
So you admit
you still like to commit criminal acts.

38:01.698 --> 38:04.034
I'm gonna commit one right now,
as a matter of fact.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.078
Where's the money?

38:08.247 --> 38:09.623
(INHALES SHARPLY)

38:09.706 --> 38:11.625
The money you had Griffith steal.

38:11.959 --> 38:12.960
(CHUCKLES)

38:13.043 --> 38:15.963
You can play dumb all you want, Doctor,
but it won't last long.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.464
The drugs will take effect soon.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.804
That's not possible.

38:25.305 --> 38:28.308
I removed the water bottles
and poured it myself.

38:30.894 --> 38:33.897
(ECHOING) You'd be surprised
how easy it is to reseal a plastic lid.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.151
Are you picking your fingernails, Doctor?

38:38.652 --> 38:40.112
'Cause that would mean you're nervous.

38:40.863 --> 38:43.031
-Are you nervous?
-(EXHALES) You can't do this to me.

38:43.115 --> 38:44.408
Tell me where the money is.

38:44.783 --> 38:46.034
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

38:46.368 --> 38:48.078
The FBI will never find it.

38:48.161 --> 38:49.830
(ECHOING) No. They won't.

38:51.498 --> 38:53.458
I am a criminal, after all.

38:54.668 --> 38:57.588
You helped me realize that,
so thank you, Doctor.

39:00.174 --> 39:02.009
All I need from you

39:04.136 --> 39:05.596
is a confession.

39:08.849 --> 39:11.185
I'm ready to begin when you are.

39:18.942 --> 39:19.943
(GASPS)

39:20.235 --> 39:23.197
Dr. Mara Summers, you're under arrest

39:23.697 --> 39:27.492
for theft, possession of illegal narcotics
and malpractice.

39:27.618 --> 39:30.412
-On the basis of what?
-Your confession.

39:31.371 --> 39:34.249
DR. SUMMERS:
<i>I knew Shane Jacoby stole that money.</i>

39:34.333 --> 39:38.003
<i>Idiot may as well have had "guilty"</i>
<i>tattooed across his forehead.</i>

39:38.086 --> 39:40.964
<i>I followed him to the vault</i>
<i>where he hid the cash.</i>

39:43.383 --> 39:45.677
This isn't legal. You drugged me.

39:46.053 --> 39:48.680
I think you mean
you accidentally drugged yourself.

39:48.805 --> 39:51.558
We're gonna do a tox screen on you
that's probably gonna match

39:51.642 --> 39:55.312
the unprescribed cocktail
you dosed Neal with at his session.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.689
And in trying to drug me again,
Peter's going with the theory

39:57.773 --> 39:59.858
that you made the mistake
of switching bottles,

39:59.942 --> 40:01.693
inadvertently harming yourself.

40:01.944 --> 40:04.696
That sounds about right. Take her.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.033
OFFICER: Ma'am.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.954
You do understand you'll never be
anything more than what you are.

40:12.955 --> 40:16.416
But at least I'm free,
which is more than I can say for you.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.169
OFFICER: Come with me.

40:28.512 --> 40:30.264
So that's it? I'm in the clear?

40:30.430 --> 40:32.349
The Bureau is not pressing any charges

40:32.432 --> 40:35.435
due to the psychological duress
you were under at the time.

40:36.061 --> 40:37.271
Thank you.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.524
-Thank you.
-Yeah, of course.

40:40.607 --> 40:42.526
No, no, thank you for showing me

40:42.609 --> 40:44.570
that guys like us can be
more than what we were.

40:46.697 --> 40:47.739
Good luck.

40:52.327 --> 40:53.328
(SIGHS)

40:58.208 --> 41:00.586
PETER: Seems like he's feeling better.

41:00.794 --> 41:03.255
Yeah. How about you?

41:03.338 --> 41:05.090
How does it feel to close a case again?

41:05.424 --> 41:08.218
I'm not so sure the case is closed.

41:09.011 --> 41:12.723
Summers cracked
and told us where she hid the $2 million,

41:12.806 --> 41:16.935
but when we went to retrieve it,
it wasn't there.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.730
Good thing we got a confession.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.748
You're telling me I can have this?

41:38.165 --> 41:41.293
Consider it an apology
for all the things I said the other night.

41:41.376 --> 41:43.045
They were things I needed to hear.

41:43.545 --> 41:45.339
It's time to
rebuild the empire, my friend.

41:45.422 --> 41:46.423
Mmm.

41:46.507 --> 41:48.675
Word of caution. The bills are marked.

41:48.759 --> 41:51.428
I can get 50 cents on the dollar.
Still a pretty good haul.

41:51.512 --> 41:53.263
I figured it wouldn't be a problem.

41:53.764 --> 41:56.099
This is illegally obtained contraband

41:56.266 --> 41:59.853
from one of your very own Suit's
federal investigations.

42:00.354 --> 42:01.522
So why'd you take it?

42:03.190 --> 42:04.441
Because it was there.

42:06.318 --> 42:09.863
"One day I'll find the right words,
and they will be simple."

42:10.197 --> 42:11.823
-Kerouac.
-Yeah.

42:11.907 --> 42:15.160
-Can't get much simpler than that.
-Not for guys like us.

42:15.452 --> 42:18.288
Guys like us? You coming back to the life?

42:20.874 --> 42:23.043
So what's your first plan of action?

42:23.877 --> 42:25.546
Change the state of play.

42:25.754 --> 42:28.674
I've been serving too many masters.
I'm through being everyone's puppet.

42:29.091 --> 42:31.218
Hagen, the FBI.

42:31.718 --> 42:34.388
Which strings exactly
do you plan on cutting?

42:34.638 --> 42:36.390
When the time comes,

42:37.099 --> 42:38.350
all of them.
