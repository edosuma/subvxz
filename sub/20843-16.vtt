00:01.770 --> 00:04.576
‐ Announcer: <i>Previously...</i>
‐ Welcome to Big Bear Lake.

00:04.576 --> 00:06.814
<i>...in a fish‐out‐of‐water</i>
<i>team challenge...</i>

00:06.814 --> 00:08.784
‐ Just takes so long!
‐ I understand,

00:08.784 --> 00:11.089
but we can't do a pinwheel
that's got bones in it.

00:11.089 --> 00:12.926
‐ <i>...the Blue Team...</i>
‐ Mm.

00:12.926 --> 00:15.965
‐ <i>...sank to the bottom.</i>
‐ Every bite I had
had bones in it.

00:15.965 --> 00:17.536
<i>...sending them</i>
<i>into a pressure test...</i>

00:17.536 --> 00:18.938
Chocolate truffles.

00:18.938 --> 00:20.808
<i>...where Daniel's</i>
<i>MasterChef dream...</i>

00:20.808 --> 00:22.278
What is this
down here?

00:22.278 --> 00:24.315
Ugh.
That's not good.

00:24.315 --> 00:27.454
‐ Love you guys!
‐ <i>...came to an end.</i>

00:28.891 --> 00:30.494
‐ <i>Tonight...</i>
‐ Ah! Chopsticks!

00:30.494 --> 00:33.300
<i>...it's a mystery box</i>
<i>from across the globe.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:35.538
‐ Whoo!
‐ Your MasterChef dreams

00:35.538 --> 00:37.007
are truly
on the line tonight.

00:37.007 --> 00:39.412
‐ <i>And then...</i>
‐ Oh, my goodness. Pasta.

00:39.412 --> 00:40.848
‐ ( howls )
‐ <i>...the home cooks...</i>

00:40.848 --> 00:43.754
‐ Come on.
‐ <i>...face their toughest</i>
challenge yet.

00:43.754 --> 00:45.825
Yachecia:
<i>Lord, I'm gonna need</i>
<i>all the help I can get.</i>

00:45.825 --> 00:48.698
Pasta's the star of the dish,
so if it's not perfect,
I'm done.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.702
The dish is a mess
and I'm pissed.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.572
<i>...leading to</i>
<i>an elimination...</i>

00:52.572 --> 00:54.710
This is one of
the toughest decisions
we've ever had to make.

00:54.710 --> 00:57.582
‐ ( exhales sharply )
‐ <i>...that shakes up</i>
the competition.

00:57.582 --> 00:59.118
( sobs )

01:13.246 --> 01:17.555
‐ Top seven!
‐ Welcome back
to the MasterChef kitchen!

01:18.557 --> 01:19.826
Whoo!

01:19.826 --> 01:22.064
I'm in the top seven!
Whoa!

01:22.064 --> 01:26.507
<i>Being a preacher, I know,</i>
<i>seven is the Biblical number</i>
<i>of completion,</i>

01:26.507 --> 01:30.113
<i>but my journey</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen,</i>
<i>it is not complete.</i>

01:30.113 --> 01:32.184
I came here to win.

01:32.184 --> 01:34.088
Gordon:
You talented seven,

01:34.088 --> 01:37.696
it's time for your next
big mystery box challenge.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.108
On the count of three,
everyone, lift those boxes.

01:45.712 --> 01:47.047
One...

01:47.047 --> 01:48.216
two...

01:48.216 --> 01:49.886
three...

01:49.886 --> 01:51.389
lift!

01:51.389 --> 01:54.395
‐ Ah! Chopsticks!
‐ ( laughter )

01:54.395 --> 01:56.934
Dino:
<i>It's a pair of chopsticks.</i>

01:56.934 --> 01:58.671
( giggles )
It was a pair of chopsticks.

01:58.671 --> 01:59.973
<i>There's no ingredients.</i>

01:59.973 --> 02:03.179
‐ There is a utensil.
‐ ( exhales )

02:03.179 --> 02:05.350
That's right,
chopsticks!

02:05.350 --> 02:09.425
One of the most
prominent utensils in all
of culinary history.

02:09.425 --> 02:11.229
A third of the world's
population

02:11.229 --> 02:13.768
eats with chopsticks
every single day.

02:13.768 --> 02:16.405
‐ Mm.
‐ They're used to eat
delicious dim sum,

02:16.405 --> 02:17.876
spectacular
Japanese sushi,

02:17.876 --> 02:19.713
Thailand's incredible
pad thai,

02:19.713 --> 02:21.215
all the dishes
that have become favorites

02:21.215 --> 02:22.317
all across America.

02:22.317 --> 02:24.388
And tonight, we want
to see you create

02:24.388 --> 02:26.894
an Asian‐inspired dish
with your spin.

02:26.894 --> 02:29.800
The pantry is fully stocked
with all kinds

02:29.800 --> 02:31.970
<i>of incredible</i>
<i>Asian specialty items.</i>

02:31.970 --> 02:34.275
<i>When it comes</i>
<i>to conceptualizing your dish,</i>

02:34.275 --> 02:37.080
the only thing
holding you back
is your imagination.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.316
Gordon:
Are you all ready

02:38.316 --> 02:41.623
to make us an incredible
MasterChef‐worthy dish?

02:41.623 --> 02:42.625
All:
Yes, Chef.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.428
Your 60 minutes...

02:44.428 --> 02:45.932
starts...

02:45.932 --> 02:47.467
‐ now!
‐ Whoo!

02:47.467 --> 02:49.004
Careful, careful,
careful, careful.

02:49.004 --> 02:51.275
Christina:
Get in there. There you go!
There you go!

02:51.275 --> 02:53.446
Cate:
Peas, peas, peas.

02:53.446 --> 02:54.783
Five Spice,
Chinese Five Spice?

02:54.783 --> 02:56.152
Scallions!

02:56.152 --> 02:57.789
Jason: <i>I'm honestly feeling</i>
<i>a bit nervous.</i>

02:57.789 --> 03:00.728
On one hand, I think
I have an advantage
over my competitors.

03:00.728 --> 03:03.934
‐ Right behind you!
‐ I grew up in an
Asian‐American community.

03:05.337 --> 03:07.241
Oh, my God.
Look at the stuff in here.

03:07.241 --> 03:10.080
<i>But on the other hand,</i>
<i>I'm feeling like the judges</i>
<i>will be expecting me</i>

03:10.080 --> 03:13.954
to have a super high level
of Asian inspiration
for this dish.

03:13.954 --> 03:16.325
<i>I need to bring my A‐game</i>
<i>to even have a chance.</i>

03:17.327 --> 03:19.131
Christina:
Here we go!

03:20.133 --> 03:21.837
Jason, you're goin'
down, man.

03:21.837 --> 03:24.008
‐ Bring it, Cate. Bring it.
‐ ( Cate chuckles )

03:25.511 --> 03:27.782
I'm making
a pork dumpling

03:27.782 --> 03:30.287
with a seafood
broth on it,

03:30.287 --> 03:33.359
shrimp fried rice,
and I'm doing two spicy sauces.

03:33.359 --> 03:36.633
As a military wife, I've
traveled all over the world
with my husband and my children.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.373
I've been to Guam,
I've been to Bangkok,
all these wonderful places.

03:40.373 --> 03:42.712
So now I just gotta
show it to 'em on a plate.

03:42.712 --> 03:45.651
‐ I'm going to you.
‐ I'm coming for your head
today, young'un.

03:45.651 --> 03:49.491
‐ You better.
‐ So, we're doing a
barbecue pork potsticker,

03:49.491 --> 03:51.395
And then I'm gonna do
pork fried rice

03:51.395 --> 03:54.736
over a nice Asian slaw
with spicy edamame.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.573
I'm really, really
excited about this challenge.

03:56.573 --> 03:58.176
My son and I love Asian food,

03:58.176 --> 04:00.447
so I really want
to make my son proud.

04:00.447 --> 04:02.685
All these seven could become
America's next MasterChef.

04:02.685 --> 04:04.121
‐ Christina: Absolutely.
‐ And they are all incredible.

04:04.121 --> 04:06.125
Now, tonight, for their
Mystery Box Challenge,

04:06.125 --> 04:08.296
chopsticks, Asian cuisine.

04:08.296 --> 04:10.568
Whoo!
Smellin' good already.

04:10.568 --> 04:12.638
Christina:
What we're looking for
is not what you get

04:12.638 --> 04:13.841
out of a take‐out box.

04:13.841 --> 04:15.811
We're looking for
something imaginative.

04:15.811 --> 04:17.314
‐ Yeah. And give it finesse.
‐ Aaron: Absolutely.

04:17.314 --> 04:19.819
It's a great opportunity
to demonstrate big flavor,

04:19.819 --> 04:21.857
but also a lot of subtleties.
You have to think about

04:21.857 --> 04:23.359
balancing with
the wonderful soy,

04:23.359 --> 04:24.596
the fermented notes of miso,

04:24.596 --> 04:26.232
trying to get
a very flavorful broth going

04:26.232 --> 04:27.702
if you're going to make broth.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.171
Christina:
But, guys, it's about
standing out.

04:29.171 --> 04:31.510
We want to see something
elegant and impressive.

04:32.512 --> 04:33.680
Yachecia: Show off!

04:33.680 --> 04:37.054
I am making some barbecue
pork fried rice

04:37.054 --> 04:38.757
with some
salt and pepper shrimp.

04:38.757 --> 04:42.532
And then I'm gonna do
a warm pineapple salad.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.734
And I'm gonna
smoke some plums.

04:43.734 --> 04:46.706
I think this is gonna be
a winning dish.

04:46.706 --> 04:49.746
When I was three months old,
we moved next door to a family

04:49.746 --> 04:52.417
that was from Hong Kong
and I'm excited to show off
my skills

04:52.417 --> 04:54.321
that my next door neighbor
taught me.

04:56.927 --> 04:58.564
Gordon:
30 minutes remaining, guys.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.333
‐ Right, Dino.
‐ How ya doin', Chef?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.337
Now, describe your dish.
What are you doing?

05:02.337 --> 05:05.076
I'm doing a Thai massaman curry
on a bed of basmati rice

05:05.076 --> 05:07.380
with a tiger shrimp wonton
with cream cheese and mint.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.550
‐ Cream cheese?
‐ Cream cheese.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.186
Cream cheese
in the Thai curry?

05:10.186 --> 05:12.257
‐ It's a very,
very small amount.
‐ Right.

05:12.257 --> 05:14.796
Because I make it
every day for myself
to stay in shape to dance.

05:14.796 --> 05:17.735
Just like you, it takes
a lot of work to be
what we are, ya know?

05:17.735 --> 05:21.041
‐ ( chuckles )
‐ I know you're hittin'
that gym. I can tell.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.547
( laughing )
What do you mean,
I'm hittin' the gym?

05:23.547 --> 05:26.051
I know you go to the gym.
When we first all saw you
we were like, "Damn."

05:26.051 --> 05:27.387
Chef Ramsay's
been workin' out."

05:27.387 --> 05:29.291
( laughing )

05:29.291 --> 05:31.563
‐ Good luck.
‐ ( howls )

05:31.563 --> 05:32.565
That's hot.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.067
‐ Jason.
‐ Hello, Chef Christina.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.773
‐ What are you making tonight?
‐ Two preparations of dumplings.

05:36.773 --> 05:39.579
One filling has pork
and cilantro with
Chinese chives

05:39.579 --> 05:41.816
and the other one is gonna be
shrimp with pea shoots.

05:41.816 --> 05:43.520
This is a bit of an homage
to my grandmother.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.256
I've seen her do it a million
times 'cause she comes from

05:45.256 --> 05:47.160
the northern part
of China, Beijing,

05:47.160 --> 05:49.498
‐ and their wheelhouse is
steamed buns and dumplings...
‐ Yes, of course.

05:49.498 --> 05:52.437
...and ravioli, so I really
wanted to go back to
my roots a little bit,

05:52.437 --> 05:53.674
‐ take it to the next level.
‐ Right. Good luck.

05:53.674 --> 05:56.378
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ Whoo‐hoo!

05:56.378 --> 05:57.815
Jeff, what's goin' on,
young lad?

05:57.815 --> 05:59.151
I'm having fun over here.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.088
Well, that's a good thing.
What do you got goin' on?

06:01.088 --> 06:03.727
I'm doin' a Vietnamese pho
inspired by my brother‐in‐law
right here.

06:03.727 --> 06:05.731
‐ Okay.
‐ This is an
incredible broth

06:05.731 --> 06:07.501
that has peppers,
I got onions,

06:07.501 --> 06:09.672
got some garlic, some shallots
to give a little more depth
to it there.

06:09.672 --> 06:11.977
And I'm going to be
doing the noodles
in just a little bit.

06:11.977 --> 06:13.847
Okay, what is gonna be
the protein in your pho?

06:13.847 --> 06:15.283
So I've actually
got filet mignon

06:15.283 --> 06:16.853
that's gonna give a nice
little lightness to it there.

06:16.853 --> 06:18.757
We've got a skirt steak
that's gonna give it
a little bit of fattiness,

06:18.757 --> 06:20.159
‐ and we've got
pork meatballs.
‐ Wow!

06:20.159 --> 06:21.997
‐ So this is gonna be nice.
‐ All right, Jeff,

06:21.997 --> 06:23.767
‐ stick with it.
‐ Sounds like a plan.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.270
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you so much, Chef.

06:26.305 --> 06:28.476
Christina:
Just under 16 minutes to go.

06:28.476 --> 06:31.950
Hallelujah,
it's smelling good!

06:31.950 --> 06:33.654
Gabriel, young man,
where are we going?

06:33.654 --> 06:35.791
So, Chef, today I want to do
my take on a Vietnamese pho,

06:35.791 --> 06:38.462
that's gonna have prawns
in a beef base,

06:38.462 --> 06:40.333
and then it's gonna be topped
with a lot of fresh herbs,

06:40.333 --> 06:41.468
It's one
of my favorite dishes.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.072
Something fascinating.
You no longer look

06:43.072 --> 06:44.074
the youngest
of this competition.

06:44.074 --> 06:45.476
You're starting to rise.

06:45.476 --> 06:47.882
Say you win this thing,
America's next MasterChef.

06:47.882 --> 06:49.552
At 19, you're not
gonna open a restaurant.
You need experience.

06:49.552 --> 06:50.654
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ So what would you do

06:50.654 --> 06:51.756
with a quarter
of a million dollars?

06:51.756 --> 06:53.527
First and foremost,
I'd take care of my parents,

06:53.527 --> 06:55.063
you know, get 'em
into a decent house.

06:55.063 --> 06:58.336
put some in the bank
and, you know, get myself
in a culinary school.

06:58.336 --> 07:00.774
‐ Culinary school.
‐ That's where my passion lies.
That's what I want to do.

07:00.774 --> 07:02.210
Well, your head's
in it to win it.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.312
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Good luck.

07:03.312 --> 07:04.314
Get your hands
on that advantage, let's go.

07:04.314 --> 07:05.483
You got it, Chef.

07:05.483 --> 07:07.555
Christina: Just under
seven minutes, guys.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.565
‐ Wow, I mean, it smells
incredible, right?
‐ It sure does.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.635
Gordon:
Dino, Dino's doing
massaman curry,

07:14.635 --> 07:18.242
so it's a Thai take
on a Persian style curry,

07:18.242 --> 07:21.883
but with deep‐fried
cream cheese in a wonton
with a shrimp.

07:21.883 --> 07:24.254
This is either gonna be
incredibly disastrous

07:24.254 --> 07:25.423
or something
quite mind‐blowing.

07:25.423 --> 07:27.561
Absolutely, then guys,
we can't forget about Jason.

07:27.561 --> 07:29.866
He's really focusing
on elevating a classic.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.402
He's making two different
types of pork dumplings.

07:31.402 --> 07:33.940
He's got a beautiful broth
he's working on on the side.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.343
Come on, Jason,
you can do this.

07:35.343 --> 07:37.681
Christina: I'm hoping
for a lot of elegant flavors.

07:37.681 --> 07:40.019
Gordon:
90 seconds remaining.

07:41.121 --> 07:42.591
Finishing touch,
finishing touch.

07:42.591 --> 07:44.227
‐ Christina: Whoo!
Come on, guys.
‐ Aarón: Let's go.

07:44.227 --> 07:48.937
Remember, a huge advantage
for one of you.

07:48.937 --> 07:50.306
‐ Gordon: Come on, guys.
‐ Christina: Presentation,

07:50.306 --> 07:52.143
presentation,
presentation.

07:52.143 --> 07:53.880
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine,

07:53.880 --> 07:57.053
eight, seven, six,

07:57.053 --> 07:59.625
five, four, three,

07:59.625 --> 08:01.328
two, one!

08:01.328 --> 08:04.201
‐ Aarón: That's it!
Hands in the air.
‐ Christina: Hands in the air!

08:04.201 --> 08:06.606
‐ Whoo‐hoo!
‐ ( applause )

08:06.606 --> 08:08.409
‐ ( howls )
‐ Gordon: Well done.

08:08.409 --> 08:10.079
Now, while you worked
at your stations,

08:10.079 --> 08:12.183
we watched you cook,
and we tasted elements

08:12.183 --> 08:14.454
of every single dish
along the way.

08:14.454 --> 08:18.630
There are three dishes
out there that we are
really intrigued by.

08:18.630 --> 08:21.603
The first home cook
was able to create a plate

08:21.603 --> 08:25.544
that is the epitome
of fusion.

08:25.544 --> 08:26.613
Please step forward...

08:33.760 --> 08:35.764
There are three
Asian dishes out there

08:35.764 --> 08:38.570
that we are
really intrigued by.

08:38.570 --> 08:41.108
The first home cook
has never won

08:41.108 --> 08:42.945
a mystery box challenge
before.

08:44.849 --> 08:48.422
Please step forward...
Dino.

08:48.422 --> 08:50.426
Cate: Go Dino!

08:50.426 --> 08:53.165
( howls )
Yes! Baby!

08:53.165 --> 08:57.775
<i>They called my name,</i>
<i>first time in the top three</i>

08:57.775 --> 08:59.712
<i>of a mystery box.</i>

08:59.712 --> 09:01.883
I feel like I won
at life right now.

09:04.287 --> 09:06.425
All right, Dino.
What's the dish?

09:06.425 --> 09:10.934
<i>The dish is a cream cheese,</i>
<i>mint, and tiger shrimp wonton,</i>

09:10.934 --> 09:13.940
<i>on a bed of Thai massaman</i>
<i>peanut curry.</i>

09:13.940 --> 09:16.913
<i>I got your classic</i>
<i>massaman veggies in there,</i>

09:16.913 --> 09:20.621
<i>potato and roasted peanuts</i>
<i>on top of basmati rice.</i>

09:20.621 --> 09:22.123
What inspired this dish?

09:22.123 --> 09:24.194
Every single day,
this is exactly what I eat.

09:24.194 --> 09:25.931
‐ Okay.
‐ Whenever I get
my paycheck,

09:25.931 --> 09:28.369
<i>it all usually goes</i>
<i>to the local Thai joint</i>
<i>down the street.</i>

09:28.369 --> 09:29.805
Presentation‐wise,
it's impressive.

09:29.805 --> 09:33.345
Flavor‐wise, you've taken
some really big risks.

09:33.345 --> 09:37.821
Shrimp, cream cheese,
mint wonton, curry.

09:37.821 --> 09:40.694
None of those things
are really supposed
to go together.

09:40.694 --> 09:43.399
Mm.

09:43.399 --> 09:44.401
All right.

09:50.146 --> 09:51.582
It shouldn't work...

09:52.651 --> 09:54.320
but it's pretty brilliant.

09:54.320 --> 09:58.162
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Please.

09:58.162 --> 10:01.769
That mint plays off
of the sweetness
of the cream cheese.

10:01.769 --> 10:05.443
<i>Frying it adds texture,</i>
<i>it keeps the moisture</i>
<i>inside that shrimp.</i>

10:05.443 --> 10:07.548
<i>And to be honest,</i>
<i>that cream cheese,</i>

10:07.548 --> 10:11.054
<i>it has a nice cooling effect</i>
<i>to that beautiful curry.</i>

10:11.054 --> 10:13.526
‐ Very nicely done.
‐ Thank you.

10:13.526 --> 10:14.895
Good job.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.872
‐ Curry's delicious.
‐ Thank you.

10:19.872 --> 10:21.876
And this...

10:27.386 --> 10:30.493
Honestly, Dino,
it's exactly like you.

10:30.493 --> 10:33.398
It's so ( bleep ) wrong,
it's right.

10:33.398 --> 10:35.069
You know what I mean?
That's the weird thing
about it.

10:35.069 --> 10:38.008
Because
the flavor combination
is quite on point.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.947
I love the curry.
The curry's the essence
for me.

10:40.947 --> 10:43.753
<i>Seasoned beautifully.</i>
<i>Not too rich, not too hot.</i>

10:43.753 --> 10:45.924
That is delicious.
Good job.

10:45.924 --> 10:46.926
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Thank you.

10:46.926 --> 10:49.097
‐ Eboni: Good job, Dino.
‐ ( applause )

10:49.097 --> 10:50.534
Good job, baby.

10:50.534 --> 10:53.773
The second dish that we'd
like to examine further.

10:53.773 --> 10:57.146
This dish has
an amazing balance
of flavors.

10:57.146 --> 10:59.017
It's time to see
if this home cook

10:59.017 --> 11:02.323
could win their third
mystery box challenge.

11:02.323 --> 11:03.760
Please step forward...

11:03.760 --> 11:05.229
Jason.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.400
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Cate: Go, Jason!

11:07.400 --> 11:09.070
I'm so excited!
I'm in the top three,

11:09.070 --> 11:11.474
<i>yet again</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

11:11.474 --> 11:13.947
<i>And this one</i>
<i>means the world to me.</i>

11:13.947 --> 11:17.855
I've represented
my Asian‐American heritage
in a strong way.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.929
Jason, talk to me
about the dish.
What's in it?

11:21.929 --> 11:24.668
<i>I have for you today</i>
<i>a preparation of two</i>
<i>different dumplings.</i>

11:24.668 --> 11:27.841
<i>The first one is pork with</i>
<i>cilantro and Chinese chives.</i>

11:27.841 --> 11:30.647
<i>The second one</i>
<i>is a gyoza‐style</i>
<i>crispy preparation</i>

11:30.647 --> 11:32.651
<i>with prawn</i>
<i>and pea tendrils,</i>

11:32.651 --> 11:34.989
<i>and then</i>
<i>a roasted shrimp broth.</i>

11:34.989 --> 11:37.126
So, why dumplings?

11:37.126 --> 11:41.334
For me, dumplings are
a reminder of my grandmother.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.638
I really wanted
to honor her.

11:42.638 --> 11:45.977
You know, growing up
they fled from China to Taiwan

11:45.977 --> 11:49.050
because of
the Communist revolution.

11:49.050 --> 11:51.221
She didn't have
a lot of money,

11:51.221 --> 11:53.660
so dumplings
was a way to, um‐‐

11:53.660 --> 11:57.500
sorry, dumplings was a way
to just feed a family.

11:58.703 --> 12:00.507
So I wanted to take
that humble beginning

12:00.507 --> 12:02.143
and elevate it
for you today.

12:03.813 --> 12:06.284
Well, you know, Jason,
food is very intimate,

12:06.284 --> 12:07.788
especially when
you share with others...

12:07.788 --> 12:09.525
‐ Thank you.
‐ ...so thank you
for that, okay?

12:10.527 --> 12:12.029
All right, pork.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.839
Your pork is
extremely flavorful.

12:16.839 --> 12:18.743
‐ Thank you.
‐ It's herbaceous.

12:18.743 --> 12:20.580
<i>It's moist,</i>
<i>it's flavorful.</i>

12:20.580 --> 12:24.153
Now this one, with the prawns.
Beautiful crust on the outside.

12:24.153 --> 12:26.424
‐ What did you cook it with?
‐ Um, it was browned
in oil a little bit,

12:26.424 --> 12:28.328
and then I put
some water in to steam it,

12:28.328 --> 12:29.865
and then crisped it
back up.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.374
‐ That is delicious.
‐ Thank you.

12:34.374 --> 12:36.879
The overall flavor
of each dumpling is there.

12:36.879 --> 12:40.219
I like the fact that you went
with something that's very
personal to you.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.856
If I were to do
something different,

12:41.856 --> 12:44.060
<i>the broth is good, it just‐‐</i>
<i>it needs some more punch.</i>

12:44.060 --> 12:45.697
‐ Sure.
‐ It needs lime.
It needs something.

12:45.697 --> 12:48.468
‐ But great dumplings.
Well done, Jason.
‐ Thank you.

12:55.215 --> 12:56.418
Hmm.

12:56.418 --> 12:58.455
This pan‐seared dumpling

12:58.455 --> 13:02.496
is just stuffed full
of that delicious prawn.

13:02.496 --> 13:04.067
Love the pea shoots
in there.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.337
Think it gives a really nice
freshness and earthiness.

13:10.079 --> 13:12.383
There's very little, I think,
to critique on this dish.

13:12.383 --> 13:14.855
<i>Everything is great.</i>
<i>The broth tastes delicious,</i>

13:14.855 --> 13:16.224
<i>and I think it was</i>
<i>pretty successful.</i>

13:16.224 --> 13:17.293
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

13:17.293 --> 13:18.395
Thank you very much.

13:18.395 --> 13:20.399
( applause )

13:22.637 --> 13:25.743
Right, the third and final dish
we'd like to take a much
closer look at.

13:25.743 --> 13:27.647
Interesting, this one.
This individual

13:27.647 --> 13:31.555
made us a dish that played
to a family connection.

13:31.555 --> 13:34.962
Please step up... Jeff.
Let's go.

13:34.962 --> 13:37.934
( applause )

13:37.934 --> 13:40.573
My brother‐in‐law would be
so proud of me right now.

13:40.573 --> 13:42.577
<i>This dish right here,</i>
<i>full of flavor</i>

13:42.577 --> 13:45.015
and full of family pride.

13:45.015 --> 13:47.954
Jeff. That looks beautiful.
Describe the dish, please.

13:47.954 --> 13:50.593
<i>I actually cooked my take</i>
<i>on a Vietnamese pho.</i>

13:50.593 --> 13:53.365
<i>You have beef broth,</i>
<i>traditional pho noodles,</i>

13:53.365 --> 13:55.269
<i>a pork meatball</i>
<i>that I had made up,</i>

13:55.269 --> 13:56.939
<i>sliced filet mignon,</i>

13:56.939 --> 13:58.141
<i>and then</i>
<i>the traditional toppings,</i>

13:58.141 --> 13:59.778
<i>the bean sprouts,</i>
<i>the jalapeño,</i>

13:59.778 --> 14:01.782
and the peppers to give it
a little bit of color.

14:01.782 --> 14:03.485
It's my homage
to my brother‐in‐law.

14:03.485 --> 14:04.821
<i>Your brother‐in‐law's</i>
<i>from Vietnam?</i>

14:04.821 --> 14:07.393
His family is.
He was born stateside.

14:07.393 --> 14:09.798
All right, visually,
it looks beautiful.

14:09.798 --> 14:12.002
It smells incredible.

14:12.002 --> 14:14.675
And the cook on the protein?
You kept it quite rare?

14:14.675 --> 14:16.144
Yes, quite rare,
so that way

14:16.144 --> 14:18.683
then the broth would really
take some of that flavor
to it there.

14:20.687 --> 14:23.926
Pork, delicious.
Beef, seasoned beautifully.

14:23.926 --> 14:26.264
The spice in that broth,
you've nailed it.

14:26.264 --> 14:28.636
You're shining,
that's pretty obvious.

14:28.636 --> 14:30.439
The only issue I've got,

14:30.439 --> 14:32.611
<i>could've done</i>
<i>with more protein,</i>
<i>less noodles.</i>

14:32.611 --> 14:34.280
‐ Okay.
‐ But here's the thing,
it's cooked beautifully.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.619
‐ It's a bloody good effort.
Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

14:42.463 --> 14:44.367
Look, man, the broth?
Flavorful.

14:44.367 --> 14:48.008
<i>Deep, rich,</i>
<i>and then the filet mignon.</i>

14:48.008 --> 14:50.012
<i>‐ What's not to like</i>
about that, right?
<i>‐ Mm‐hmm.</i>

14:50.012 --> 14:51.982
Needs a little
ratio adjustment.

14:51.982 --> 14:54.353
Gordon's absolutely right.
Too much noodles.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.357
But other than that,
I think you did a great job.

14:56.357 --> 14:57.861
and I think your brother‐in‐law
would be very proud of you.

14:57.861 --> 14:58.929
Thank you very much.

14:58.929 --> 15:00.933
( applause )

15:03.471 --> 15:04.541
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you.

15:04.541 --> 15:07.112
( all murmuring )

15:07.112 --> 15:08.481
Gordon:
Dino, Jason and Jeff.

15:08.481 --> 15:10.319
Tonight, the three of you
presented truly stunning,

15:10.319 --> 15:12.489
elevated, MasterChef‐worthy
dishes.

15:14.661 --> 15:17.667
But unfortunately,
there can only be
one winner.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.642
The recipient
of this game‐changing
advantage...

15:21.642 --> 15:23.378
That person is...

15:24.480 --> 15:26.084
Congratulations...

15:31.995 --> 15:33.064
Dino, Jason, and Jeff,

15:33.064 --> 15:35.870
you know there can
only be one winner.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.707
The recipient
of this incredible,

15:37.707 --> 15:40.011
game‐changing advantage...

15:40.011 --> 15:41.080
That person is...

15:45.255 --> 15:47.025
Dino.

15:47.025 --> 15:48.863
Cate: Good job, Dino!

15:48.863 --> 15:52.269
I won it!
Baby doll, I won!

15:52.269 --> 15:55.643
Ah, young man, please,
come and join us up here,
right now.

15:55.643 --> 15:57.947
Not only did a finally
make it to the top three

15:57.947 --> 16:00.953
<i>of a mystery box challenge,</i>
<i>I won the challenge.</i>

16:00.953 --> 16:03.391
This is a big deal.

16:03.391 --> 16:05.061
All of you,
please make your way down,
thank you.

16:05.061 --> 16:07.567
Let's go.
Thank you.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.602
Right, Dino.
First the good news.

16:08.602 --> 16:10.238
You do not
have to compete

16:10.238 --> 16:12.209
in the elimination challenge
tonight.

16:12.209 --> 16:15.248
So you are officially
in the top six.

16:15.248 --> 16:17.119
‐ Congratulations, Dino.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

16:17.119 --> 16:18.923
There's one more
big advantage,

16:18.923 --> 16:21.762
and that advantage involves
a series of choices.

16:21.762 --> 16:24.768
And the choices
you're about to make
will directly influence

16:24.768 --> 16:27.941
who'll be
going home tonight.

16:27.941 --> 16:32.382
The competition is about
to be put in your hands.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.086
‐ Give me two seconds.
‐ Okay.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.300
Eboni:
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

16:41.300 --> 16:44.841
What in the world are
they gonna let Dino do to us?

16:44.841 --> 16:46.645
♪ It's coming. ♪

16:48.147 --> 16:50.520
All: Oh...

16:52.422 --> 16:54.761
Oh, Lordy, Lordy,
Lordy, Lordy.

16:56.364 --> 16:57.700
Pasta.

17:01.909 --> 17:04.814
Now, pasta is the staple
of Italian cuisine.

17:04.814 --> 17:09.223
These six are just
a few of the hundreds
of varieties of pasta.

17:09.223 --> 17:11.995
Here we have,
in order of difficulty...

17:23.786 --> 17:26.858
<i>...and of course...</i>

17:26.858 --> 17:28.294
Gordon:
Now, young man,

17:28.294 --> 17:29.496
as you probably guessed,

17:29.496 --> 17:31.668
these six amazing pastas

17:31.668 --> 17:33.539
are for the six
talented home cooks

17:33.539 --> 17:35.342
standing right
in front of us.

17:35.342 --> 17:37.714
And tonight,
they are all gonna need

17:37.714 --> 17:41.788
to make one of those
incredible fresh pastas
from scratch,

17:41.788 --> 17:46.297
and turn it into an incredible
MasterChef‐worthy dish.

17:46.297 --> 17:47.867
Tonight, you decide

17:47.867 --> 17:50.806
who will be making
which pasta, understood?

17:50.806 --> 17:52.042
Yes, Chef.

17:52.042 --> 17:55.850
Dino has the fate
of "MasterChef" in his hands,

17:55.850 --> 17:58.421
and we are not
the best of friends.

17:58.421 --> 18:00.559
<i>I'm so scared right now.</i>
<i>I'm so scared right now.</i>

18:00.559 --> 18:02.997
Now, let's start off
with the simplest.

18:02.997 --> 18:06.270
Dino, who would you like
to assign pappardelle?

18:09.009 --> 18:11.815
I've seen this person fail
on a meat challenge before.

18:11.815 --> 18:14.019
If the stress of making
perfect pasta wasn't
hard enough,

18:14.019 --> 18:16.725
I think finding the sauce
for this is a lot
harder than it seems.

18:16.725 --> 18:18.896
So I'm gonna go with Jason.

18:18.896 --> 18:21.467
‐ Gordon: Wow.
‐ Thank you.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.039
I know that I have
the easiest pasta to make today,

18:24.039 --> 18:26.878
so I have to elevate it
by making it more high‐end,

18:26.878 --> 18:28.682
maybe adding flavoring
to the pasta.

18:28.682 --> 18:30.653
<i>This is gonna be</i>
<i>a challenge for me.</i>

18:30.653 --> 18:33.091
Up next, who do you want to
assign the farfalle to?

18:34.594 --> 18:36.765
So this is a sort
of a different type
of strategy.

18:36.765 --> 18:38.569
I'm not really trying
to get rid of this person.

18:38.569 --> 18:40.606
I'd like to see this person
get a little farther,

18:40.606 --> 18:44.079
'cause I'd like
to take this person out
in the finale.

18:45.248 --> 18:46.885
Eboni.

18:46.885 --> 18:48.387
Eboni:
<i>Have you lost</i>
<i>your mind, Dino?</i>

18:48.387 --> 18:50.091
If I had the opportunity
to take me out,

18:50.091 --> 18:52.395
I would take me out.
Boy, I hope you don't think

18:52.395 --> 18:54.233
that you can beat me
in a head‐to‐head,

18:54.233 --> 18:56.905
<i>because I would slaughter you</i>
<i>and put it all on a plate.</i>

18:56.905 --> 18:58.074
Christina:
<i>Dino, cannelloni.</i>

18:58.074 --> 18:59.944
It's a little harder
than it looks to make,

18:59.944 --> 19:02.015
so gonna try
to throw them off.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.754
‐ Gabriel.
‐ Christina: Interesting.

19:04.754 --> 19:06.658
Aarón:
<i>The difficulty level</i>
<i>of these pastas</i>

19:06.658 --> 19:07.727
is getting
serious now, guys.

19:07.727 --> 19:09.229
Dino, please pick up
that cavatelli.

19:09.229 --> 19:11.902
I see this person struggling
on not only making this,

19:11.902 --> 19:13.906
but what to do with it.

19:13.906 --> 19:15.676
Cate, babe.

19:17.212 --> 19:19.183
The only two home cooks

19:19.183 --> 19:21.086
who still have to be
allocated their pastas

19:21.086 --> 19:22.924
are Jeff and Yachecia,

19:22.924 --> 19:24.561
The tortellini
is just a nightmare.

19:24.561 --> 19:27.432
Get that too thick
then it's too chewy
and you can't cook it.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.704
The egg yolk ravioli.
We have seen

19:29.704 --> 19:32.944
the most talented,
the most determined
individuals

19:32.944 --> 19:34.914
leave this competition
through that.

19:36.618 --> 19:39.624
Dino, tell me,
which of these two
home cooks

19:39.624 --> 19:42.663
you're to assign
the tortellini.

19:44.901 --> 19:48.575
‐ Yachecia.
‐ ( laughs )

19:51.013 --> 19:52.617
Gordon:
So let's confirm this.

19:52.617 --> 19:56.423
The egg yolk ravioli
is going to your beloved Jeff.
Why?

19:56.423 --> 19:58.528
Not only do you
gotta make this thin,

19:58.528 --> 19:59.998
but when
they cut into it,

19:59.998 --> 20:01.668
that yolk better
( bleep ) run.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.337
‐ For days.
‐ Yeah, for days.

20:03.337 --> 20:04.507
Mr. Cocky over here.
We'll see.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.978
‐ Don't you worry.
‐ Yeah, baby.

20:06.978 --> 20:08.281
I don't think
you can do it.

20:08.281 --> 20:10.385
( laughter )

20:10.385 --> 20:12.289
Wait and see, baby.
Wait and see.

20:12.289 --> 20:13.792
All right.
Come here, baby.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.531
‐ Got it.
‐ Come here. Here. Here.

20:16.531 --> 20:17.967
‐ You're gonna
break it, buddy.
‐ Here.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.138
‐ Grab the thing!
‐ You're gonna break it.

20:20.138 --> 20:21.908
I'm gonna break it.

20:21.908 --> 20:23.812
Our MasterChef
love fest continues.

20:23.812 --> 20:25.315
So Dino, truthfully,

20:25.315 --> 20:27.485
‐ are you sending Jeff home?
‐ I'd like to.

20:27.485 --> 20:29.557
I think out of all
the people here
I'd miss you the least.

20:31.393 --> 20:32.897
Jeff, how do you feel?

20:32.897 --> 20:34.567
I'm stoked!
Are you kidding me?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.203
I got the prime one
out here to work with.

20:36.203 --> 20:37.740
‐ You're not nervous about it,
a little bit?
‐ No.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.577
If I show any weakness
and nervousness,

20:39.577 --> 20:41.246
it's gonna show in the dish,
and at the end of the day,

20:41.246 --> 20:43.117
I got a hard one
to work with,

20:43.117 --> 20:44.453
so I gotta bring
my best for it.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.423
I've always loved
a good challenge.

20:46.423 --> 20:48.094
If I'm gonna be
the next MasterChef,

20:48.094 --> 20:49.897
<i>I have to push myself.</i>

20:49.897 --> 20:52.235
Dino, please, head up
to the balcony.

20:52.235 --> 20:53.805
Hey, don't overcook
that rav, all right?

20:53.805 --> 20:56.110
Don't you worry.
I'll let you have
the first slice into it.

20:56.110 --> 20:57.880
No, I don't eat crap.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.216
Jeff:
<i>This egg yolk ravioli</i>

20:59.216 --> 21:01.420
<i>is going to be cooked</i>
<i>to perfection,</i>

21:01.420 --> 21:03.024
just to shut him up.

21:03.024 --> 21:05.896
Pasta? This Irish boy's
gonna show an Italian

21:05.896 --> 21:07.065
what it's all about.

21:14.346 --> 21:16.016
Gordon: You six,
you'll have 45 minutes

21:16.016 --> 21:18.955
to cook us a dish
with the pasta

21:18.955 --> 21:21.427
that Dino
assigned you all.

21:21.427 --> 21:23.899
Your 45 minutes starts...

21:23.899 --> 21:24.901
...now.

21:27.038 --> 21:28.274
Whoo!

21:31.280 --> 21:32.650
Whoop!
Sorry.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.386
Lord, I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

21:34.386 --> 21:35.889
The celery's
already in there.

21:35.889 --> 21:38.728
In the Vegas pressure test,
I had to make pasta on the fly,

21:38.728 --> 21:40.899
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a complete hot mess.</i>

21:40.899 --> 21:42.402
Pasta's the star
of the dish,

21:42.402 --> 21:43.939
so if it's not perfect,
I'm done.

21:43.939 --> 21:45.074
Ah, there it is.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.249
Whoo!

21:52.957 --> 21:54.594
Cate, baby,
what are you making?

21:54.594 --> 21:58.334
I'm making cavatelli
with ricotta

21:58.334 --> 22:01.340
blanched peas,
crisp up some prosciutto

22:01.340 --> 22:04.112
and then finish it
with some Parmigiano Reggiano.

22:04.112 --> 22:07.887
I've made pasta before,
and I'm gonna really
impress the judges,

22:07.887 --> 22:10.391
and impress Dino
with his Italian roots.

22:10.391 --> 22:11.794
That's right, baby.

22:11.794 --> 22:15.802
Dino had six very important
decisions to make tonight.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.573
It's very clear
who he's going for.

22:17.573 --> 22:19.442
The tortellini and
the egg yolk ravioli

22:19.442 --> 22:22.917
were going straight out
to Yachecia and Jeff,
respectively.

22:22.917 --> 22:24.419
I think, more importantly,
he wants Jeff out.

22:24.419 --> 22:26.423
Come on, these two have been
at each other since day one.

22:26.423 --> 22:28.027
Are you mad at me, Jeff?

22:28.027 --> 22:30.031
I got a contest
I gotta win here, buddy.

22:30.031 --> 22:32.302
Pasta dough
is incredibly tricky

22:32.302 --> 22:33.872
when it comes to
how much you touch it.

22:35.174 --> 22:37.111
You mix it just until
it has enough moisture,

22:37.111 --> 22:39.115
and then you must
let it rest.

22:39.115 --> 22:41.386
...bad boy
in the fridge.

22:41.386 --> 22:42.957
Gordon:
It's a tough one.
All six

22:42.957 --> 22:45.127
are intricate
and demanding.

22:47.232 --> 22:50.906
Guys, 15 minutes gone.
Just under 30 minutes
remaining.

22:50.906 --> 22:53.010
‐ Jeff, Jeff,
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
‐ Yes.

22:53.010 --> 22:55.081
<i>Egg yolk ravioli.</i>
<i>The most difficult one.</i>

22:55.081 --> 22:56.884
You got a target on the front
and the back of you.

22:56.884 --> 23:00.024
Dino sees me as a threat.
He's seen me as at threat
since the beginning.

23:00.024 --> 23:02.362
What kind of message
do you want to send
to Dino tonight?

23:02.362 --> 23:05.869
That he's gotta stop
his yapping because this is
a winner right here, baby.

23:05.869 --> 23:07.606
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you so very much.

23:09.844 --> 23:11.614
‐ Yachecia,
what's going on?
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:11.614 --> 23:14.452
Man, did you get screwed
with the tortellini or what?

23:14.452 --> 23:16.189
I mean, I'm not
100% comfortable.

23:16.189 --> 23:18.060
I've never made 'em before,
but, you know,

23:18.060 --> 23:19.864
there's a first time
for everything, right?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.368
What are you making
the tortellini with?

23:22.368 --> 23:24.139
Chicken and pork
on the inside,

23:24.139 --> 23:26.811
and I'm gonna dress the plate
with some blistered tomatoes,

23:26.811 --> 23:29.249
and then I'm gonna top that
with a pesto sauce.

23:29.249 --> 23:31.219
Why chicken
and pork together?

23:31.219 --> 23:33.324
I want to have
the chicken in there
for a little different flavor.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.096
‐ All right, good luck
to you, okay?
‐ Thank you.

23:36.096 --> 23:38.233
Mmm!
That's good.

23:41.039 --> 23:42.776
Looking good, Gabe.

23:42.776 --> 23:43.878
‐ Gabriel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:43.878 --> 23:46.450
Dino assigned you
cannelloni tonight.

23:46.450 --> 23:49.790
‐ He sure did.
‐ How familiar are you
with Italian food?

23:49.790 --> 23:51.794
A little bit familiar.
It's one of my favorite
things to eat,

23:51.794 --> 23:53.197
but not something
that I make quite often.

23:53.197 --> 23:54.800
‐ Okay.
‐ I kinda get the flavors,

23:54.800 --> 23:56.236
'cause it's one of my dad's
favorites as well,

23:56.236 --> 23:57.740
and my mom used to make it
for him all the time,

23:57.740 --> 23:59.476
but I'm not afraid
to try my hand at it.

23:59.476 --> 24:01.848
Okay, now talk me through
what you're working on.

24:01.848 --> 24:03.885
I got an heirloom tomato sauce
working right here.

24:03.885 --> 24:05.856
‐ Okay.
‐ And a puree to make it
a little bit smoother.

24:05.856 --> 24:07.425
‐ Okay.
‐ And then I'm just going to

24:07.425 --> 24:09.329
blanch those shells
and roll them,

24:09.329 --> 24:12.503
and then stuff them
with a ricotta‐spinach
filling.

24:12.503 --> 24:14.673
‐ Prove to me you deserve
to be in this kitchen.
‐ You got it, Chef.

24:14.673 --> 24:15.842
‐ Let's go.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

24:16.844 --> 24:18.180
‐ Eboni.
‐ Yes, Chef.

24:18.180 --> 24:19.583
Come on, farfalle.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.854
‐ That means
the butterfly pasta.
‐ Right.

24:21.854 --> 24:24.225
But let's be honest,
you sting like a bee,
don't you?

24:24.225 --> 24:25.796
‐ I do.
‐ What's the dish?
What are you doing?

24:25.796 --> 24:29.302
I'm doing the bow tie pasta
with some pork Italian sausage

24:29.302 --> 24:31.406
and I'm putting a little bit
of mushroom and spinach
in there.

24:31.406 --> 24:34.279
‐ And I'm gonna do like
a butter sauce to top it.
‐ Okay, great.

24:34.279 --> 24:35.916
Now, busy household,
mum of four.

24:35.916 --> 24:37.753
Tell me about
some of the pasta dishes
you've got at home.

24:37.753 --> 24:40.491
I make them mac and cheese
or chicken alfredo,

24:40.491 --> 24:42.596
something simple that's quick
'cause usually during the week

24:42.596 --> 24:44.098
I'm working, so I don't
have a lot of time.

24:44.098 --> 24:45.735
‐ Good luck, you can do this.
‐ All right, thank you.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.340
‐ Good luck.
‐ Just under
seven minutes, guys.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.977
‐ Jason.
‐ Chef Aarón.

24:49.977 --> 24:51.112
Talk to me about what
you're making.

24:51.112 --> 24:53.518
Today I'm making
pappardelle,

24:53.518 --> 24:56.022
I'm gonna gussy it up
with chanterelles,

24:56.022 --> 24:58.494
and then a meat ragu,
like a Bolognese.

24:58.494 --> 25:01.333
I love mushrooms,
so coming from New England,

25:01.333 --> 25:04.038
I go forage for mushrooms
in the fall,

25:04.038 --> 25:06.777
so this is a bit of Italian
meets New England.

25:06.777 --> 25:08.715
‐ Jason, we're
counting on you.
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.785
‐ All right, talk to you soon.
‐ Thank you so much.

25:13.423 --> 25:15.394
‐ Gordon: That was intense.
‐ Christina: It's getting
tough out there, guys.

25:15.394 --> 25:18.133
Right now Jeff and Yachecia
are running way behind, okay?

25:18.133 --> 25:20.639
Yachecia has not perfected
the art of tortellini.

25:20.639 --> 25:23.243
And Jeff is now rolling
fresh pasta again.

25:23.243 --> 25:26.082
Nothing would make
Dino happier if either one
of them went home.

25:26.082 --> 25:28.655
I can do this.
I believe in myself.

25:28.655 --> 25:30.625
Christina:
I'm also equally
as worried about Gabriel.

25:30.625 --> 25:33.263
He is struggling
with the shape
of that cannelloni.

25:33.263 --> 25:35.702
Ahh!
How much time I got?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.371
60 seconds to go.

25:37.371 --> 25:40.344
‐ Aah!
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.

25:40.344 --> 25:43.150
Yachecia, you gotta push,
mama, let's go.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.855
Gordon: Remember,
when we get to zero,
that is the end.

25:45.855 --> 25:49.128
Your pasta must
be out of your water.

25:49.128 --> 25:52.301
Christina:
Gotta have it
on a plate.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.372
Gordon:
This is it.

25:54.372 --> 25:55.809
The hero is the pasta.

25:55.809 --> 25:58.313
You gotta move, guys.

25:58.313 --> 26:00.317
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine...

26:00.317 --> 26:03.423
eight, seven, six,

26:03.423 --> 26:06.664
five, four, three,

26:06.664 --> 26:08.534
two, one!

26:08.534 --> 26:11.272
‐ Gordon: And stop.
‐ Christina: Hands in the air.

26:11.272 --> 26:12.609
( howls )

26:13.611 --> 26:15.180
Gordon:
Unbelievable.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.884
You six,
well done.

26:16.884 --> 26:20.892
It's time to see
whose dishes will
take us to Italy,

26:20.892 --> 26:24.499
and whose dish
will transport them home.

26:24.499 --> 26:28.708
First up, the man
with the biggest target
on his back, Jeff.

26:28.708 --> 26:30.845
‐ Yachecia: All right, Jeff.
‐ ( applause )

26:30.845 --> 26:32.481
Jeff: <i>Dino thinks</i>
<i>he's gonna be sending me home.</i>

26:32.481 --> 26:35.989
but that yolk is no joke
right here, people.

26:35.989 --> 26:37.993
<i>It's gonna glisten,</i>
<i>it's gonna run.</i>

26:37.993 --> 26:40.532
<i>I know I nailed it.</i>

26:40.532 --> 26:41.701
Describe the dish,
Jeff, please.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.606
<i>What we have here</i>
<i>is an egg yolk ravioli,</i>

26:44.606 --> 26:46.777
<i>that I've done up</i>
<i>with a little bit</i>
<i>of truffle oil,</i>

26:46.777 --> 26:49.082
<i>sage brown butter,</i>
<i>and Pecorino Romano.</i>

26:49.082 --> 26:51.887
Okay, so, truthfully...

26:51.887 --> 26:53.356
it looks a mess.

26:55.260 --> 26:58.366
Two big no‐nos.
Raw sage, shocking.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.872
Burnt onion.
Why would you
put that on there?

27:00.872 --> 27:02.007
When I was trying
to strain it all out,

27:02.007 --> 27:05.013
it just kind of came
through at the end there.

27:05.013 --> 27:06.149
Visual
on the actual pasta,

27:06.149 --> 27:08.153
you can see
that it's sort of crimped.

27:08.153 --> 27:10.925
<i>That one, the dough started</i>
<i>to dry out a little bit for me.</i>

27:10.925 --> 27:13.430
When you got one perfect one,
serve it.

27:13.430 --> 27:17.404
Don't put three on there
that detract from the stunner.

27:17.404 --> 27:20.110
Now, I want
to slice in there,

27:20.110 --> 27:22.849
and I want to see that
oozing out.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.352
‐ Dino.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.422
‐ Think he nailed it?
‐ I'm not sure.

27:37.211 --> 27:39.248
Now, I want
to slice in there,

27:39.248 --> 27:43.123
and I want to see
that oozing out.

27:43.123 --> 27:44.626
‐ Dino.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:44.626 --> 27:46.931
‐ Think he nailed it?
‐ I'm not sure.

27:52.576 --> 27:53.578
Wow.

27:55.515 --> 27:56.617
You've nailed it.

28:02.061 --> 28:03.196
‐ Delicious.
‐ Thank you.

28:03.196 --> 28:06.202
<i>It's rich.</i>
<i>Seasoned beautifully,</i>

28:06.202 --> 28:09.810
but the pasta could've done
with a touch thinner,

28:09.810 --> 28:13.483
‐ Okay.
‐ The plate
is badly dressed.

28:13.483 --> 28:18.059
‐ Tough one. You got given
the most awkward to nail...
‐ Sure.

28:18.059 --> 28:20.264
...because the man
on the balcony
wants you out,

28:20.264 --> 28:22.334
and you've nailed it.
Thank you, Jeff.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.907
Thank you.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.191
There's something beautiful
about the simplicity

28:34.191 --> 28:38.935
<i>of just straightforward pasta</i>
<i>with a simple egg yolk</i>
<i>that's salted.</i>

28:38.935 --> 28:41.707
‐ It just needs
more finesse.
‐ True.

28:41.707 --> 28:43.511
But look, man,
the difficulty of this,

28:43.511 --> 28:46.115
if I were to give a number
on it, it's a ten.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.219
So, good job.

28:54.231 --> 28:56.069
Next up, please, Eboni.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.706
‐ Cate: Come on,
girlfriend.
‐ ( applause )

28:57.706 --> 28:59.676
Eboni:
<i>Dino gave me</i>
<i>farfalle pasta.</i>

28:59.676 --> 29:01.379
I thought this pasta
was gonna be easy.

29:01.379 --> 29:03.517
You cut it, you fold it.
It's little bow ties.

29:03.517 --> 29:04.619
<i>It'll be easy, right?</i>

29:05.688 --> 29:08.193
Hold your breath,
'cause it ain't.

29:08.193 --> 29:10.865
Miss Eboni.
Give me a description
of the dish real quick.

29:10.865 --> 29:15.374
<i>I did farfalle</i>
<i>with pork sausage,</i>

29:15.374 --> 29:19.382
<i>mushrooms and spinach,</i>
<i>butter, and fried basil.</i>

29:19.382 --> 29:22.121
And I kind of cooked
that down with garlic,

29:22.121 --> 29:24.559
a little bit of thyme,
peppercorn, salt and pepper.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.740
‐ It's delicious.
‐ ( chuckles )

29:31.740 --> 29:34.211
Thank you, Chef.

29:34.211 --> 29:37.585
It's simple.
Your pasta's
cooked beautifully.

29:37.585 --> 29:39.255
<i>There's texture</i>
<i>to that pork sausage,</i>

29:39.255 --> 29:41.325
<i>there's a little heat,</i>
<i>there's the salt,</i>

29:41.325 --> 29:42.896
<i>there's a sweetness to it.</i>

29:42.896 --> 29:45.200
I don't think you need
the mushrooms.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.739
Maybe just some beautiful
red chili flakes on top

29:47.739 --> 29:50.210
just to bring a little
color to the top there.

29:50.210 --> 29:51.513
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ That's a delicious
bowl of pasta.

29:51.513 --> 29:52.849
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you.

29:55.287 --> 29:57.291
Why the sausage?

29:57.291 --> 29:58.961
I just was trying to go
with something

29:58.961 --> 30:01.399
that I knew I could pack
a lot of flavor into it.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.637
Mmm. That is delicious.

30:06.075 --> 30:09.081
The sheen on there,
it's got all the little
dregs of sauce,

30:09.081 --> 30:12.956
<i>ground sausage,</i>
<i>and that spicy sauce,</i>
<i>you've nailed it.</i>

30:12.956 --> 30:16.830
All my pasta
is beautifully glazed,

30:16.830 --> 30:18.667
and nothing's dry.

30:18.667 --> 30:19.803
It's so good.

30:19.803 --> 30:21.907
Here's the thing,
flavor's there.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.811
Presentation needs work,

30:23.811 --> 30:29.021
but for me, one of
the best‐tasting dishes
so far in this competition.

30:29.021 --> 30:31.527
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Cate: Nice job, Eboni.

30:31.527 --> 30:33.831
( applause )

30:33.831 --> 30:35.868
Next up, please, Gabriel.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.705
‐ Yachecia: All right, Gabe.
‐ Cate: Come on, Gabe.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.609
Gabriel:
<i>Working fast food,</i>
<i>I don't make a lot of money,</i>

30:39.609 --> 30:42.682
<i>so I'm not gonna spend money</i>
<i>on upscale Italian cuisine.</i>

30:42.682 --> 30:45.521
<i>My inexperience with cannelloni</i>
<i>really worked against me.</i>

30:45.521 --> 30:46.723
I'm not happy with the shape,

30:46.723 --> 30:48.794
I'm not happy with
the structure of the pasta.

30:48.794 --> 30:50.665
<i>I'm just hoping</i>
<i>that the flavors are there.</i>

30:50.665 --> 30:52.535
‐ Gabriel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

30:52.535 --> 30:54.071
What do we have?

30:54.071 --> 30:55.875
<i>We have a cannelloni</i>
<i>that was stuffed</i>

30:55.875 --> 30:57.579
<i>with a ricotta‐spinach</i>
<i>filling,</i>

30:57.579 --> 30:59.716
<i>topped with</i>
<i>a rustic tomato sauce</i>

30:59.716 --> 31:01.018
<i>and some fresh</i>
<i>grated cheese.</i>

31:01.018 --> 31:02.254
Have you ever cooked
cannelloni before?

31:02.254 --> 31:03.591
Never before, Chef.

31:03.591 --> 31:05.795
This is not
what it's supposed
to look like.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.437
I'm not happy with it.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.278
They should be
round tubes,

31:14.278 --> 31:17.017
<i>where your cannelloni</i>
<i>look like they've been</i>
<i>deflated.</i>

31:17.017 --> 31:18.687
Yes, Chef.

31:18.687 --> 31:22.829
Whatever you choose
to stuff that cannelloni
with needs to be firm.

31:22.829 --> 31:24.566
It needs to be able
to hold its shape.

31:24.566 --> 31:26.168
How did you season
that filling?

31:26.168 --> 31:28.741
Gabriel: I seasoned it
with a little bit
of spinach

31:28.741 --> 31:30.043
and then some salt,
some pepper,

31:30.043 --> 31:32.682
and a slight amount
of the ground nutmeg.

31:35.755 --> 31:37.090
Filling's not great.

31:37.090 --> 31:39.428
<i>I wish it had</i>
<i>more seasoning.</i>

31:39.428 --> 31:41.700
<i>That sauce,</i>
<i>it's a tad sweet,</i>

31:41.700 --> 31:44.873
but the real disappointment,
as you already know,

31:44.873 --> 31:46.710
is the technique
of that pasta.

31:46.710 --> 31:49.281
‐ That's really what
we're after tonight.
‐ Yes, Chef.

31:52.789 --> 31:55.528
It looks dreadful.

31:57.464 --> 31:59.803
I mean, hand on heart,
that looks like a lasagna,

31:59.803 --> 32:01.305
as opposed
to a cannelloni.

32:03.911 --> 32:07.017
The sauce is so sweet,
it's extraordinary.

32:07.017 --> 32:08.486
Gabriel:
While it was cooking down,
it didn't seem

32:08.486 --> 32:10.190
as though it was really
being as pungent,

32:10.190 --> 32:12.762
so I just added a little bit
of sugar to try and bring it up
a little bit more.

32:12.762 --> 32:15.433
What happens to tomatoes
the more you caramelize them?

32:15.433 --> 32:17.170
‐ They get sweeter, Chef.
‐ They get sweeter.

32:17.170 --> 32:18.841
So you started them off
with sugar,

32:18.841 --> 32:21.947
and then got them even sweeter
in the cooking process.

32:21.947 --> 32:26.222
The filling, bland.
Pasta is a disaster.

32:26.222 --> 32:29.361
It's your worst
performing dish, Gabriel.

32:31.633 --> 32:32.635
Thank you.

32:35.140 --> 32:37.979
Miss Cate,
please bring
your dish down.

32:37.979 --> 32:39.481
‐ ( applause )
‐ Yachecia: Good luck, Cate.

32:39.481 --> 32:41.218
Cate:
<i>This was definitely</i>
<i>the hardest challenge</i>

32:41.218 --> 32:43.089
I have had
in this kitchen.

32:43.089 --> 32:45.761
<i>I've never made</i>
<i>cavatelli before,</i>

32:45.761 --> 32:48.065
but I've had
a similar dish like this

32:48.065 --> 32:49.501
at a restaurant in Chicago,

32:49.501 --> 32:53.276
and the flavors just worked
so well together.

32:53.276 --> 32:55.514
Cate, talk to me
about your dish.
What's in it?

32:55.514 --> 32:58.152
<i>I made cavatelli,</i>

32:58.152 --> 33:02.160
<i>with peas and mint</i>
<i>and a homemade herb ricotta.</i>

33:02.160 --> 33:03.797
Peas and mint,
I love that.

33:03.797 --> 33:05.300
It's a very
traditional pairing.

33:09.742 --> 33:11.913
I really
like the garnish.

33:11.913 --> 33:13.917
<i>Having two cheeses,</i>
<i>the parmesan, and the ricotta</i>

33:13.917 --> 33:16.288
<i>playing together</i>
<i>make a lot of sense,</i>

33:16.288 --> 33:19.394
and you were very heavy‐handed
with the amount of peas,
which is a good thing.

33:19.394 --> 33:21.098
The cook, al dente.

33:21.098 --> 33:23.102
I wish the pasta was
done a little bit better.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.473
It's a little gummy.
It's a little thick.

33:25.473 --> 33:28.179
‐ Yeah.
‐ But, overall,

33:28.179 --> 33:30.751
‐ it's a very good dish.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

33:30.751 --> 33:34.692
Visually, the dish
is beautiful.

33:34.692 --> 33:37.197
‐ There's rustic
elegance to it.
‐ Yeah.

33:41.940 --> 33:44.646
<i>Peas taste delicious.</i>

33:44.646 --> 33:46.616
<i>Ricotta, nice flavor,</i>

33:46.616 --> 33:49.889
but this is
a light dish, right?

33:49.889 --> 33:51.960
It's meant to be
celebratory of spring.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.532
I would've just loved to see
that sauce brighter and lighter

33:54.532 --> 33:57.003
and celebratory
of that cavatelli pasta.

33:57.003 --> 33:59.341
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ ( applause )

33:59.341 --> 34:00.578
Jeff:
Nice job, Cate.

34:01.913 --> 34:04.519
Please, Jason,
bring your dish down.

34:04.519 --> 34:05.821
( applause )

34:05.821 --> 34:07.925
I've never made pappardelle
from scratch before,

34:07.925 --> 34:09.996
<i>but I have a lot</i>
<i>of food knowledge.</i>

34:09.996 --> 34:11.866
<i>I've been to Rome</i>
<i>with my brother,</i>

34:11.866 --> 34:13.369
<i>tasted lots</i>
<i>of local things,</i>

34:13.369 --> 34:16.008
<i>so I know which flavors</i>
<i>go well together.</i>

34:16.008 --> 34:18.446
My pappardelle is gonna be
a ticket to the balcony.

34:18.446 --> 34:19.649
‐ Jason.
‐ Yes, Chef.

34:19.649 --> 34:21.385
Talk to me about your dish.
What's in it?

34:21.385 --> 34:25.628
<i>This is pappardelle</i>
<i>with my version</i>
<i>of a Bolognese.</i>

34:25.628 --> 34:27.732
<i>I used half beef</i>
<i>and half pork.</i>

34:27.732 --> 34:31.506
<i>The pasta has a little bit</i>
<i>of porcini powder in there.</i>

34:31.506 --> 34:32.742
And this over here?

34:32.742 --> 34:34.879
This is a little bit more
of the Bolognese sauce.

34:34.879 --> 34:37.652
<i>The pappardelle, visually,</i>
<i>it looks spot‐on.</i>

34:37.652 --> 34:39.756
‐ Thank you.
‐ Let's get in here, buddy.

34:43.930 --> 34:46.536
The flavor's dynamite.

34:46.536 --> 34:48.439
There's no way around it.

34:48.439 --> 34:51.011
<i>I feel that it has</i>
<i>that depth of flavor</i>

34:51.011 --> 34:52.280
that a Bolognese
should have.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.084
It tastes like it's
been cooking for hours...

34:54.084 --> 34:56.021
‐ Thank you.
‐ ...which is a great thing.

34:56.021 --> 34:57.958
<i>The pasta, spot‐on.</i>

34:57.958 --> 35:00.898
‐ <i>I think you went overboard</i>
<i>with the aromatic spices.</i>
‐ <i>Okay.</i>

35:00.898 --> 35:03.235
‐ Overall, good job, Jason.
‐ Thank you.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.641
‐ ( applause )
‐ Good job, Jason.

35:05.641 --> 35:06.876
Jeff:
Nice job, Jason.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.684
Next up, Yachecia,
please, let's go.

35:10.684 --> 35:12.220
Come on, Yachecia.

35:12.220 --> 35:14.424
Yachecia:
<i>Dino gave me</i>
<i>the second hardest pasta,</i>

35:14.424 --> 35:17.230
and it can be
so, so tricky

35:17.230 --> 35:19.167
<i>to get this type</i>
<i>of pasta right.</i>

35:19.167 --> 35:21.940
<i>But I know that my tortellini</i>
<i>is beautiful.</i>

35:21.940 --> 35:23.944
The shape is perfect.

35:23.944 --> 35:25.279
Describe the dish, please.

35:25.279 --> 35:29.555
It is a tortellini
with chicken and pork,

35:29.555 --> 35:31.225
<i>and a little bit</i>
<i>of ricotta mixture inside,</i>

35:31.225 --> 35:34.064
<i>served with a chicken broth,</i>
<i>roasted tomatoes,</i>

35:34.064 --> 35:36.468
<i>and garnished with just</i>
<i>a tad bit of pesto.</i>

35:36.468 --> 35:38.740
Traditionally, I know
it's generally served with pork,

35:38.740 --> 35:40.409
and I just wanted
to add a little chicken

35:40.409 --> 35:42.948
to go with the broth
that I was serving with it.

35:46.421 --> 35:47.758
Yachecia,
that's terrible.

35:47.758 --> 35:50.096
Well, I tasted it.
I thought it was
pretty tasty to me.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.335
What bit did you think
was "pretty tasty"?

35:53.335 --> 35:55.006
I thought the filling
tasted well,

35:55.006 --> 35:57.277
and the broth was nice
and rich and deep.

35:57.277 --> 35:59.014
Where's she gone?

35:59.014 --> 36:02.688
Gordon: Chicken and pork,
the most ridiculous
ideas to put together.

36:02.688 --> 36:05.727
The thickness
of the tortellini
is terrible.

36:05.727 --> 36:08.633
It looks like the filling
of a canned food.

36:08.633 --> 36:12.641
And it's got no texture,
it's got no flavor.

36:12.641 --> 36:14.444
And you serve it
in a stock,

36:14.444 --> 36:16.481
<i>that looks like it's come out</i>
<i>of the bottom of a dishwasher.</i>

36:16.481 --> 36:18.319
I think the only
saving grace tonight

36:18.319 --> 36:20.256
is the actual shape
of the tortellini.

36:20.256 --> 36:23.462
You've sort of done
a pretty decent job,
Yachecia.

36:23.462 --> 36:26.603
‐ Yes.
‐ Dino wanted you out.

36:26.603 --> 36:29.341
I don't want you
to leave this competition.

36:29.341 --> 36:31.178
But I'm gonna
be honest with you.

36:31.178 --> 36:34.184
I think it's your worst
performing dish that you've
cooked for us so far.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.206
Well done, all of you.

36:45.206 --> 36:47.544
Tough, tough, tough challenge,
let's get that right.

36:47.544 --> 36:51.118
Dino, please,
make your way down.
Thank you.

36:51.118 --> 36:52.621
At this point
in the competition,

36:52.621 --> 36:53.857
<i>there are definitely people</i>

36:53.857 --> 36:54.859
<i>I really want to see</i>
<i>go home right now,</i>

36:54.859 --> 36:56.194
<i>based on, you know, skills.</i>

36:56.194 --> 36:58.800
And I think my strategy
paid off.

37:00.704 --> 37:03.677
Let's get straight
to the good news.

37:03.677 --> 37:07.518
There were two
extraordinary dishes
out there tonight.

37:07.518 --> 37:10.189
The first dish,
congratulations...

37:10.189 --> 37:12.360
‐ Jason.
‐ Thank you.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.699
‐ Gordon: Good job.
‐ Cate: Nice job, Jason.

37:14.699 --> 37:17.036
The winning dish
of the night...

37:17.036 --> 37:18.873
congratulations...

37:18.873 --> 37:20.510
Eboni.

37:20.510 --> 37:21.546
( laughs )

37:21.546 --> 37:23.516
Way to go, Eboni.

37:23.516 --> 37:24.785
‐ Thank you.
‐ Gordon: Well done.

37:24.785 --> 37:25.787
Good job.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.858
Unfortunately,
home cooks,

37:27.858 --> 37:29.996
this is
an elimination
challenge.

37:29.996 --> 37:33.903
and at least one home cook
has to leave the kitchen
tonight.

37:33.903 --> 37:38.178
If I say your name,
please come down
to the front.

37:38.178 --> 37:39.515
Yachecia

37:39.515 --> 37:40.917
and Gabriel.

37:45.359 --> 37:48.399
You two, this is one
of the toughest decisions
we've ever had to make.

37:48.399 --> 37:52.340
We felt that, both of you,
not only were you so strong,

37:52.340 --> 37:54.912
but were going further.

37:54.912 --> 37:56.415
But unfortunately
both of you fell short

37:56.415 --> 37:58.953
with too many technical errors
across both dishes.

38:02.126 --> 38:06.501
The home cook
that is leaving tonight,

38:06.501 --> 38:08.540
that person is...

38:13.583 --> 38:15.754
Gabriel, I'm sorry, bud.

38:15.754 --> 38:17.925
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Oh, no!

38:19.762 --> 38:21.599
Yachecia,
say goodbye to Gabriel

38:21.599 --> 38:23.503
and head back
to your station, please.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.284
Gabriel, unfortunately,
young man, you were beaten

38:31.284 --> 38:34.525
by the technical ability
of your cannelloni tonight.

38:34.525 --> 38:35.927
You know,
I've got news for you.

38:35.927 --> 38:38.533
You may be going back
to Oklahoma tonight,

38:38.533 --> 38:44.545
but you're not going back
to be a fast food server.

38:44.545 --> 38:47.316
Young man, it's very rare
that we see such raw talent

38:47.316 --> 38:50.422
that's got amazing potential
come through this competition.

38:50.422 --> 38:52.761
You've got the potential
to be huge in this industry.

38:52.761 --> 38:54.999
You just need
the right training.

38:54.999 --> 38:59.775
So I am personally
gonna send you

38:59.775 --> 39:01.311
to culinary school.

39:01.311 --> 39:03.550
( gasps, applause )

39:06.388 --> 39:10.764
‐ Thank you, Lord.
‐ I'll pay the tuition
full‐time.

39:10.764 --> 39:12.066
Oh, my goodness.

39:12.066 --> 39:14.470
And I don't want you
worrying about Mum and Dad,

39:14.470 --> 39:17.076
‐ 'cause I'm taking
care of that.
‐ Thank you.

39:17.076 --> 39:21.418
If this is how good you are
without proper training,

39:21.418 --> 39:24.490
young man,
at 19 years of age,

39:24.490 --> 39:29.768
let me tell you,
you've got the potential
to be great.

39:29.768 --> 39:33.743
‐ Will you accept
that offer?
‐ Hell yes, Chef.

39:33.743 --> 39:35.947
Gabriel,
you might be going
back to Oklahoma

39:35.947 --> 39:38.519
to take Chef Gordon's
once‐in‐a‐lifetime offer,

39:38.519 --> 39:42.193
but after that,
I want you to leave
Oklahoma

39:42.193 --> 39:45.366
‐ and come to New Orleans.
‐ Oh, wow!

39:45.366 --> 39:49.040
'Cause I'm prepared
to offer you a job
in one of my restaurants.

39:49.040 --> 39:51.144
‐ Gabe.
‐ Will you accept
my offer?

39:51.144 --> 39:53.883
‐ Hell, yeah, Chef.
‐ Outstanding.

39:53.883 --> 39:57.323
Gabriel, I want to know
how you feel now.

39:57.323 --> 39:59.360
All I've wanted to do
is learn and cook,

39:59.360 --> 40:00.897
and I get
to do both of them

40:00.897 --> 40:03.035
under tutelage
from two people I've admired

40:03.035 --> 40:05.005
since I was, like, seven,
so I can't‐‐

40:07.076 --> 40:09.480
I can't be happier.

40:11.852 --> 40:13.523
‐ Wow.
‐ Hey.

40:13.523 --> 40:16.361
‐ Come on up here.
‐ Cate: You're amazing, Gabriel!

40:18.165 --> 40:19.267
Thank you, Chef.

40:21.004 --> 40:22.273
We're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

40:22.273 --> 40:24.043
Tell Mom and Dad
not to worry, all right?

40:24.043 --> 40:27.350
So impressed.
Get in here.

40:27.350 --> 40:29.287
Now, please,
take that apron off,

40:29.287 --> 40:32.093
‐ I look forward
to seeing you soon.
‐ Likewise, Chef. Thank you.

40:32.093 --> 40:34.230
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Cate: Go, Gabriel!

40:34.230 --> 40:35.734
I'm not going back
to fast food.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.403
I'm not going back
to my regular routine.

40:37.403 --> 40:40.309
<i>I'm changing my life,</i>
<i>and that is all thanks</i>
<i>to "MasterChef"</i>

40:40.309 --> 40:42.146
<i>and what the judges</i>
<i>have presented me.</i>

40:42.146 --> 40:44.317
My parents have
always struggled.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.787
<i>They don't make</i>
<i>a lot of money,</i>

40:45.787 --> 40:48.559
<i>so Chef Ramsay offering</i>
<i>to pay for my culinary school</i>

40:48.559 --> 40:50.229
<i>and telling me not</i>
<i>to stress about my parents</i>

40:50.229 --> 40:53.301
is a huge relief,
because they are the main people

40:53.301 --> 40:55.607
that I care about,
love and respect.

40:55.607 --> 40:57.511
I'm so happy for you!

40:57.511 --> 41:01.084
On top of that,
I get to go and experience
this amazing food scene

41:01.084 --> 41:03.956
<i>and this amazing restaurant</i>
<i>that Chef Sanchez</i>
<i>wants to put me at.</i>

41:03.956 --> 41:05.794
<i>To me, that's the world.</i>
<i>That's the jackpot.</i>

41:05.794 --> 41:08.131
The trophy's shiny,
but this is amazing.

41:08.131 --> 41:10.870
‐ Eboni: Bye, baby.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

41:10.870 --> 41:12.373
Cate:
Oklahoma!

41:20.322 --> 41:21.324
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

41:21.324 --> 41:22.961
‐ Whoo!
‐ Oh, my God.

41:22.961 --> 41:25.399
This is beautiful.

41:25.399 --> 41:27.637
‐ <i>...it's a</i>
<i>picture perfect...</i>
‐ Welcome,

41:27.637 --> 41:30.442
<i>to the Triunfo Creek</i>
<i>Vineyard.</i>

41:30.442 --> 41:32.079
<i>...pop‐up restaurant.</i>

41:32.079 --> 41:34.083
‐ First table, four filet,
two duck.
‐ All: Yes, Chef!

41:34.083 --> 41:36.020
<i>But when things</i>
<i>turn ugly in the kitchen...</i>

41:36.020 --> 41:38.191
‐ Let's go!
‐ Come on!
Get the food out!

41:38.191 --> 41:40.462
‐ <i>...which team...</i>
‐ It's freezing cold
in the center.

41:40.462 --> 41:43.201
‐ Come on!
‐ <i>...will tear</i>
<i>itself apart?</i>

41:43.201 --> 41:45.038
‐ Jeff is a loser.
‐ Thank you so much.

41:45.038 --> 41:47.276
Stop saying "thank you"
and ( bleep ) cook!

41:47.276 --> 41:49.013
‐ Okay, just stop.
‐ Shut up and plate.

41:49.013 --> 41:50.115
Oh, my God.
