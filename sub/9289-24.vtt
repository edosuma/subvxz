00:13.578 --> 00:15.286
You may not be able to contact me.

00:15.372 --> 00:17.661
- Why?
- Chappelle became a problem.

00:17.749 --> 00:19.956
I had to take him out of play
and they're onto me.

00:20.043 --> 00:23.246
- They'll take me out soon.
- Who do I contact if I need help?

00:23.338 --> 00:25.829
Michelle is setting up an off-site station.

00:25.924 --> 00:28.795
- You're under arrest. Where's Dessler?
- I can find her.

00:30.679 --> 00:32.885
Affirmative, Central. She's in custody.

00:34.224 --> 00:35.884
Kim? Hello?

00:35.976 --> 00:37.767
- Who are you?
- I'm Kate Warner.

00:37.853 --> 00:39.596
Your father sent me to come get you.

00:39.688 --> 00:43.223
Why would my dad send someone
he'd just met to come get me?

00:43.316 --> 00:44.859
He trusts me.

00:44.943 --> 00:47.979
The sooner we leave, the sooner
you and your dad can be together.

00:48.071 --> 00:50.527
The Attorney General said
you'd want me for your counsel.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.320
- What have they told you?
- You've been removed from office.

00:53.410 --> 00:57.657
The evidence was manipulated
by a man named Peter Kingsley.

00:57.747 --> 00:59.954
I need you to find out everything
you can about him.

01:00.041 --> 01:03.909
- What happens now?
- We got one last play. Deliver Kingsley.

01:04.004 --> 01:07.503
He's far too dangerous,
and you'll never get close to him.

01:07.591 --> 01:10.342
You're right. I won't, but you will.

01:10.427 --> 01:12.752
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed.

01:12.846 --> 01:15.633
If you say you can deliver him,
that should get his attention.

01:15.724 --> 01:18.131
I want the tapes that you made
of our conversation.

01:18.226 --> 01:20.018
I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.

01:20.103 --> 01:23.306
All right. LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes.

01:23.398 --> 01:27.692
- What support will you get from CTU?
- As of now, none. Ow!

01:28.278 --> 01:30.484
Jack? Jack!

01:46.546 --> 01:49.120
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:56.598 --> 01:58.923
Come on.

01:59.017 --> 02:02.967
Damn it. The car won't start.
We gotta get out of here.

02:04.981 --> 02:07.817
My seat belt's jammed.

02:09.401 --> 02:12.736
Mrs Palmer, I'm gonna need your help.

02:15.325 --> 02:17.068
Mrs Palmer, please don't do this.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.197
I'm sorry, but I have to
take care of myself.

02:20.288 --> 02:22.328
When I'm free I'll call an ambulance.

02:22.415 --> 02:26.247
- You can't do this!
- I don't have a choice.

02:26.336 --> 02:28.079
You're a very impressive man,

02:28.171 --> 02:31.256
but you see everything as
either good or bad, just like David.

02:31.341 --> 02:34.876
- The world is so much more complicated.
- No, it's simple.

02:34.970 --> 02:39.098
There's a war about to start and you're
the only person who can help me stop it.

02:39.182 --> 02:43.429
- What about the president?
- He turned away from me.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.348
After 25 years of building a life together,
a family, he turned me away.

02:48.442 --> 02:51.229
Eventually they will connect you
to this conspiracy.

02:51.319 --> 02:53.810
That bomb was never supposed to go off.

02:53.905 --> 02:56.942
None of this was supposed
to happen this way.

02:57.033 --> 03:01.494
I know. I believe you.
You can put an end to it now.

03:01.580 --> 03:05.827
If you help me get Kingsley,
your husband will get his presidency back.

03:05.917 --> 03:08.373
That will be because of you.

03:08.462 --> 03:10.953
Mrs Palmer, please.

03:11.047 --> 03:13.538
God damn it!

03:28.565 --> 03:31.566
What do you want me to do?

03:31.651 --> 03:35.981
There's a knife in the glove box.
Help cut me out.

03:40.243 --> 03:41.702
Come on in.

03:41.787 --> 03:46.781
This is much better. It's simpler.
We gotta be able to explain this thing.

03:46.875 --> 03:50.623
- I need to talk to you, Mike.
- I'll be down in five minutes.

03:50.712 --> 03:52.503
Mike.

03:52.589 --> 03:54.249
It's important.

03:56.384 --> 03:57.760
Excuse me.

04:10.357 --> 04:12.017
What is it?

04:12.109 --> 04:15.560
It's a file on Peter Kingsley.
They pulled it up a few minutes ago.

04:15.654 --> 04:19.651
Peter Kingsley, the man Jack Bauer
thinks is behind the bomb.

04:19.741 --> 04:23.193
There's a record of phone calls he made,
as recently as six hours ago,

04:23.286 --> 04:25.326
to a soldier named Jonathan Wallace.

04:25.413 --> 04:28.580
Wallace was a member
of the Coral Snake brigade.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.372
He apparently killed his own men.

04:32.462 --> 04:34.704
I know who Wallace is.

04:34.798 --> 04:38.630
The planes have passed over
their final checkpoint

04:38.718 --> 04:41.256
and will reach their targets
within the hour.

04:41.346 --> 04:43.504
Our primary targets are all military,

04:43.598 --> 04:48.344
but one includes a command-and-control
centre inside a residential area.

04:48.437 --> 04:53.644
As smart as our weapons have become,
there may be some collateral damage.

04:54.693 --> 04:57.231
You mean civilian casualties.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.565
Yes, sir.

04:59.823 --> 05:03.322
- There's no way to avoid these?
- I'm afraid not.

05:06.163 --> 05:09.413
Then it's something
we're just gonna have to live with.

05:13.753 --> 05:14.785
Ryan Chappelle.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.588
- Ryan, this is Mike Novick.
- How can I help you, sir?

05:19.676 --> 05:24.919
I know there's been some confusion today
about the veracity of the Cyprus audio.

05:25.015 --> 05:28.431
Not really. Our teams came
to the same conclusion as Langley.

05:28.518 --> 05:33.809
Do you know if Bauer's still trying to find
evidence that the recording was fabricated?

05:33.899 --> 05:36.935
Yes, but he's operating
outside our authority.

05:37.027 --> 05:39.696
I want you to assist his investigation.

05:39.780 --> 05:44.109
- Sir, I don't even know where he is.
- Then find him.

05:44.201 --> 05:46.952
I'm not sure why you're
asking me to do this.

05:47.037 --> 05:49.907
I was told we're at war
and to proceed accordingly.

05:49.998 --> 05:53.616
We're not at war yet.
You have 30 minutes to report back to me

05:53.710 --> 05:55.916
the findings of Bauer and your efforts.

05:56.004 --> 05:58.329
- But sir...
- That's a direct order, Ryan.

05:58.423 --> 06:02.551
You have my channel.
Call me back on this line. That's all.

06:06.556 --> 06:10.056
- I'll be on the plane in an hour.
- Why the delay?

06:10.143 --> 06:14.011
The bomb detonating in the wrong location
created a little extra work.

06:14.106 --> 06:16.478
Nothing to worry about, I hope.

06:16.566 --> 06:19.140
Not at all. I won't bore you
with the details.

06:19.236 --> 06:21.228
Bore me.

06:22.405 --> 06:25.157
I still have to take care of Alex Hewitt.

06:25.242 --> 06:28.408
Hewitt is the only one
who can bring this whole thing down.

06:28.495 --> 06:31.615
- You told me you'd have him by now.
- I wasn't able to find him.

06:31.706 --> 06:35.040
But I'm taking care of it. Don't worry.

06:42.926 --> 06:44.966
Sit down, both of you.

06:45.053 --> 06:48.173
You don't need Michelle here.
She was acting under my orders.

06:48.265 --> 06:51.764
- I can defend myself, Tony.
- I said sit down.

06:58.942 --> 07:02.691
I need you to get me in contact
with Jack Bauer.

07:03.989 --> 07:09.825
Oh, I see. Jack got some support above you
and now you're being squeezed, right?

07:09.911 --> 07:12.402
Can you do it or not?

07:12.497 --> 07:14.620
What's goin' on?

07:15.917 --> 07:19.536
Bauer's evidence might
actually have some relevance.

07:19.629 --> 07:23.081
- Which means we were right.
- No. You damn near put me in a coma.

07:23.175 --> 07:25.463
That's assault.

07:28.263 --> 07:33.470
I'll tell you what.
You drop the charges against us...

07:35.812 --> 07:38.647
and we'll help you.

07:41.485 --> 07:46.147
Come on, Ryan. You of all people
know that's your best move.

07:52.078 --> 07:54.616
- Fine.
- In writing.

07:54.706 --> 07:59.000
All right, in writing.
Just get me in touch with Bauer.

08:02.506 --> 08:07.214
- Shouldn't we call for help?
- I'm not working under CTU's authority.

08:07.302 --> 08:10.338
- To them I don't exist.
- So we're out on our own.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.090
Completely.

08:12.182 --> 08:15.633
- Are you all right? You need some help?
- He got hurt.

08:15.727 --> 08:18.764
- Can you get us to a hospital?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

08:18.855 --> 08:22.105
- Mrs Palmer, you need to drive.
- What do you mean?

08:22.192 --> 08:26.605
- Sorry, but we need your car.
- Hey, easy, all right? Go ahead, take it.

08:29.658 --> 08:31.864
Thank you.

08:51.346 --> 08:53.671
They're ready, sir.

09:05.402 --> 09:09.102
- Miss Warner. Hi. Carrie Turner.
- Hi. Kate.

09:09.197 --> 09:11.949
- You must be Jack's daughter Kim.
- Where's my dad?

09:12.033 --> 09:16.695
He's still in the field. Wait here.
I'll tell Ryan Chappelle you're here.

09:16.788 --> 09:20.323
- I'll handle this.
- I thought you were in custody.

09:20.417 --> 09:23.169
I was released.

09:23.837 --> 09:28.214
Kim, I heard what happened to you.
Are you all right?

09:28.300 --> 09:33.175
Yeah, I guess so. Look, I just wanna see
my dad and make sure he's OK.

09:33.263 --> 09:36.846
No, he's not here right now.
He won't be back for a couple of hours.

09:36.933 --> 09:40.183
- Does he know I'm here?
- No. We'll tell him when he phones in.

09:40.270 --> 09:43.113
Listen, Jack insisted we call
as soon as we get here.

09:43.213 --> 09:44.517
He's just not reachable now.

09:44.608 --> 09:48.855
I'll have Carrie take you back and
get you situated. I'll be there in a minute.

09:50.447 --> 09:51.775
Hey.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.234
It's gonna be OK.

09:56.953 --> 09:58.661
OK.

10:00.707 --> 10:02.700
Miss Warner?

10:04.127 --> 10:06.535
I don't know if you're aware of this but...

10:06.630 --> 10:10.164
your father came back here
after we released him.

10:10.258 --> 10:11.254
Why?

10:11.343 --> 10:14.842
He wanted to talk to your sister
before she was taken away.

10:14.930 --> 10:18.464
- They brought Marie back here?
- Yeah.

10:25.732 --> 10:28.519
You lied to me?

10:28.610 --> 10:31.315
You killed Reza?

10:32.322 --> 10:35.572
You tried to kill your own sister?

10:35.659 --> 10:41.614
You were willing to set off a nuclear bomb
in a city with ten million people?

10:45.836 --> 10:50.165
You tell me why.
Because I need to understand.

10:52.509 --> 10:54.627
Tell me that they forced you to do it,

10:54.827 --> 10:57.669
that they brainwashed you,
that they threatened you.

10:57.764 --> 11:02.177
You can tell me that you didn't
know what you were doin'.

11:03.854 --> 11:06.689
There must be a reason.

11:07.566 --> 11:10.139
There is no reason, Dad.

11:15.073 --> 11:17.695
I can't accept that.

11:24.207 --> 11:26.200
I couldn't either.

11:27.586 --> 11:34.549
Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed
a gun at me and started to pull the trigger.

11:39.139 --> 11:41.131
Trust me, Dad.

11:41.975 --> 11:45.309
She's not gonna give you any answers.

11:46.271 --> 11:51.016
She can't. At least, nothing
that we could ever understand.

12:06.249 --> 12:07.909
Dad...

12:12.589 --> 12:15.080
Come on. Let's go.

12:35.112 --> 12:36.772
Kate.

13:12.649 --> 13:15.484
You think you'll be safe out there.

13:18.822 --> 13:20.815
You won't be.

13:36.631 --> 13:39.419
- Jack, it's Tony.
- Tony, you back in play?

13:39.509 --> 13:42.083
Yeah. Jack, Kim's here at CTU.

13:42.179 --> 13:46.342
- She's safe.
- Thank God. Don't tell her what's going on.

13:46.433 --> 13:49.268
- Just say I'll be back as soon as I can.
- I will.

13:49.352 --> 13:52.768
- Jack, this is Ryan. We need to talk.
- You son of a bitch.

13:52.856 --> 13:55.477
You stopped that chopper
picking up me and Hewitt.

13:55.567 --> 13:59.896
- Hewitt's dead. I hold you responsible.
- Listen, things have changed.

13:59.988 --> 14:03.606
You got full support.
Give me your mission profile.

14:04.951 --> 14:06.944
I've set up a meeting with Kingsley.

14:07.037 --> 14:09.824
We're gonna meet him
at the LA Coliseum, gate 18.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.287
Mrs Palmer will wear a wire
and make him confirm

14:12.375 --> 14:15.080
that the three countries had
nothing to do with the nuke.

14:15.170 --> 14:19.215
Stand down until you get some support.
Our people will be there soon.

14:19.299 --> 14:22.834
We don't have time. Kingsley's
expecting the meet to go down now.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.920
You need backup.

14:25.013 --> 14:31.182
If you wanna help me, get me voice prints of
Kingsley and Mrs Palmer for authentication.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.467
Done.

14:32.562 --> 14:36.892
- And a live audio feed to the White House.
- You want an audience with the president.

14:36.983 --> 14:39.225
Yes.

14:39.319 --> 14:41.608
All right. Keep the line clear.

14:41.696 --> 14:43.798
Copy. We're pulling into the Coliseum now.

14:43.977 --> 14:47.153
We need to get a SWAT
team to his location.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.824
Pull over there.

14:58.255 --> 15:00.746
Wait here for me.

15:14.521 --> 15:16.514
Come on.

15:21.945 --> 15:24.946
Let's get you wired.

15:29.411 --> 15:32.281
Take your jacket off your shoulder.

15:34.374 --> 15:36.414
This is a wireless transmitter.

15:36.501 --> 15:42.171
They won't know to look for it.
They won't be able to trace it.

15:42.257 --> 15:47.049
- This is crazy. We shouldn't do this alone.
- We don't have another choice.

15:47.137 --> 15:50.802
Remember, Kingsley doesn't want
to leave here without Hewitt.

15:50.891 --> 15:54.010
That's gotta be to our advantage.

16:00.066 --> 16:02.688
OK, say something.

16:02.778 --> 16:04.854
I'm scared.

16:07.073 --> 16:08.983
OK, it's working.

16:21.004 --> 16:22.498
- Yes, Mike.
- Mr President,

16:22.589 --> 16:25.557
I am against any delay
in our military actions.

16:25.757 --> 16:26.634
I have been from the start.

16:26.718 --> 16:33.136
But there is a good chance we'll receive
evidence soon the Cyprus recording is false.

16:33.225 --> 16:36.641
We know Second Wave brought
the nuke into the country

16:36.728 --> 16:40.808
and we know they're sponsored by
these three countries. What am I missing?

16:40.899 --> 16:44.897
I don't have all the details,
but I just learned about a possible link

16:44.986 --> 16:48.770
between Second Wave
and a man named Peter Kingsley.

16:48.865 --> 16:50.443
Who is he?

16:50.534 --> 16:56.157
He's apparently part of a consortium of oil
interests with contracts in the Caspian Sea.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.287
An oil consortium's behind the nuke?

16:58.375 --> 17:01.217
Jack Bauer believes he can get
a confession from Kingsley.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.416
He's set up a live audio feed.

17:03.505 --> 17:06.921
Our bombers are due to drop their payloads
in less than 20 minutes.

17:07.008 --> 17:10.093
Bauer's meeting Kingsley any minute.

17:11.387 --> 17:14.223
This is the live voice print.

17:14.307 --> 17:18.554
And this is the voice file we have on record

17:18.645 --> 17:24.268
which will prove that it is,
in fact, Sherry Palmer.

17:24.358 --> 17:26.684
- It's confirmed.
- The one below is Kingsley?

17:26.778 --> 17:29.565
- Yeah.
- Are you guys getting this?

17:29.656 --> 17:32.361
- We're good here.
- How far out is our backup?

17:32.451 --> 17:35.701
- They're 11 minutes out.
- That's too long. We've gotta go now.

17:35.787 --> 17:37.827
- Just wait.
- We can't.

17:37.914 --> 17:41.864
We're already ten minutes past
the meeting time. Is Prescott ready?

17:41.960 --> 17:45.744
Tony's on with the White House.
They're setting up a live audio feed.

17:45.839 --> 17:47.463
OK, good. We are set to go.

17:50.677 --> 17:53.085
How are you doing, Mrs Palmer?

17:53.180 --> 17:56.430
What's to prevent Kingsley
from shooting me?

17:56.516 --> 17:59.007
He won't do anything until he gets Hewitt.

17:59.102 --> 18:03.563
But the moment he realises
we don't have Hewitt...

18:03.648 --> 18:06.056
I'll be covering your back.

18:06.151 --> 18:11.228
That's not very comforting
considering the condition you're in.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.814
I may not make it out of this.

18:15.952 --> 18:19.950
I'm not gonna lie to you, Mrs Palmer.
That's a possibility.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.830
I'm doing this for David.
You know that, don't you?

18:33.136 --> 18:34.761
Yes.

18:34.846 --> 18:38.844
Will you tell him that?
In case something happens.

18:41.394 --> 18:46.140
I'll take care of it, Mrs Palmer.
You've gotta go now.

19:16.263 --> 19:17.721
- Mike.
- Yes, sir.

19:17.806 --> 19:19.573
We just finished setting up the feed.

19:19.773 --> 19:22.017
I hope this isn't gonna
be a waste of our time.

19:22.102 --> 19:24.807
Believe me, Mr President, so do I.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.892
What's going on, Mike?

19:31.903 --> 19:35.153
The president and I thought
you should be part of this.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.438
Along with Prescott and
the Attorney General,

19:37.538 --> 19:39.487
we will be listening to a live feed.

19:39.578 --> 19:43.326
- Of what?
- A sting operation against Peter Kingsley.

19:43.415 --> 19:46.167
It appears he was the architect
of today's bombing

19:46.251 --> 19:49.003
and the delivery of the Cyprus audio.

19:51.006 --> 19:52.998
- Bauer found Kingsley.
- Yes.

19:53.091 --> 19:57.837
But... it won't be Bauer
who'll be talking to Kingsley.

19:58.638 --> 20:04.095
What difference does it make as long
as we get him to incriminate himself?

20:04.936 --> 20:06.596
What is it, Mike?

20:13.945 --> 20:17.445
It's Sherry who'll be talking to Kingsley.

20:18.492 --> 20:20.318
I don't understand.

20:20.410 --> 20:25.405
It seems that Kingsley recruited her
some months ago.

20:25.499 --> 20:28.168
She was part of this.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.546
Sherry was working with this man, Kingsley?

20:33.632 --> 20:35.423
It appears that way, sir.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.465
To detonate a nuclear bomb and start a war?

20:39.554 --> 20:41.096
No.

20:41.181 --> 20:45.642
It's unclear how much she knew,
or how deep she was in it.

20:46.478 --> 20:51.056
We just have to hope she can extract
a confession from Kingsley.

20:51.149 --> 20:55.064
So now Sherry is working with Jack Bauer
to bring down Kingsley?

20:55.153 --> 20:59.151
Yes. And at considerable risk to herself.

21:54.921 --> 21:57.922
Scott, don't do anything
until I tell you to.

21:58.008 --> 22:00.677
- We need Hewitt.
- Understood.

22:58.401 --> 23:01.652
- Where's Hewitt?
- He's safe.

23:02.989 --> 23:04.069
Where is he?

23:04.908 --> 23:08.906
You lied to me. You wanted
this bomb to go off all along.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.206
You used Roger Stanton and you used me.

23:14.584 --> 23:15.829
Yes, I did.

23:15.919 --> 23:21.459
Well, now I'm tied to you, and
the nuclear detonation. I want safe haven.

23:21.550 --> 23:25.168
- That's your problem.
- Well, I just made it yours.

23:25.262 --> 23:27.835
Because you won't see Hewitt until I'm safe.

23:27.931 --> 23:32.059
- Don't horse trade with me.
- Don't insult my intelligence.

23:32.144 --> 23:36.391
- We got a match on Kingsley's voice.
- Ryan, you got it.

23:37.899 --> 23:40.900
You're not going anywhere
till I have Hewitt.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.109
That doesn't work for me.

23:47.159 --> 23:53.197
I'll call you on this line to give you
Hewitt's location after I'm safely away.

23:53.290 --> 23:55.329
You don't need to know where I'm going.

23:55.417 --> 23:59.794
- We're not getting what we need here.
- She'll get it for you.

24:04.968 --> 24:09.381
- Now there's the matter of the recordings.
- They're right here.

24:09.473 --> 24:13.138
Every phone conversation
between you and me.

24:16.146 --> 24:20.642
No. I want all of them, including Cyprus.

24:23.403 --> 24:25.894
Why Cyprus?
You had nothing to do with that.

24:25.989 --> 24:29.192
- Insurance.
- Insurance?

24:29.284 --> 24:35.120
Once the country goes to war, the
government will never let that be exposed.

24:35.207 --> 24:38.243
Hewitt is the only one who can hurt us.

24:38.335 --> 24:41.289
- Because he forged the Cyprus recording.
- Right.

24:41.379 --> 24:46.088
- You got your proof. Let me go ahead.
- Get it confirmed from the White House.

24:46.176 --> 24:49.794
- She can't stay much longer.
- Are you satisfied?

24:49.888 --> 24:53.222
CTU wants to know
if that's enough to prove it.

24:53.308 --> 24:57.436
Have you confirmed this is live
and the voices have been authenticated?

24:57.521 --> 24:59.809
Yes, sir.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.771
- So that's it.
- Yes.

25:04.861 --> 25:08.361
When I land... I'll call you.

25:09.199 --> 25:10.741
Hm.

25:12.369 --> 25:16.497
You're bluff in'.
You don't have Hewitt, do you?

25:16.581 --> 25:19.251
- Oh, yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

25:25.882 --> 25:28.634
Scott, take her out.

25:37.394 --> 25:39.386
Kill her.

25:47.070 --> 25:49.312
Run, Sherry!

26:51.301 --> 26:53.792
Come on. Come on.

27:05.649 --> 27:08.318
Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go!

28:44.915 --> 28:45.994
Jack Bauer.

28:52.422 --> 28:56.254
You've caused me a lot
of trouble today, Jack.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.757
You're not gonna give me Hewitt, are you?

29:45.225 --> 29:48.179
Our bombers are three minutes
from the targets.

29:48.270 --> 29:52.599
Initiating sequence
six one tango one.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.766
Target in view. Weapons lock.

29:56.486 --> 29:59.404
Are we go for a strike?

29:59.489 --> 30:02.443
Are we go for a launch?

30:03.994 --> 30:05.785
We are awaiting command.

30:05.871 --> 30:07.910
Abort the attack.

30:07.998 --> 30:11.164
Abort, abort.

30:25.891 --> 30:29.141
What do you mean, Kingsley's dead?
How could that happen?

30:29.227 --> 30:31.635
I warned you not to use him.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.055
So we did use him and he failed.

30:34.149 --> 30:37.066
But it won't matter.
Once the war starts we'll be OK.

30:37.152 --> 30:41.197
- It isn't going to start.
- Why's that?

30:41.281 --> 30:44.982
The president found out about the Cyprus
recording and called off the attack.

30:45.076 --> 30:48.077
There isn't going to be any war, Max.

30:49.873 --> 30:54.334
Well... we're going to have
to do this another way.

30:54.419 --> 30:58.203
- Another way? What are you talking about?
- You'll find out.

30:58.298 --> 31:00.291
It'll start today.

31:08.975 --> 31:11.645
It's me. Go ahead.

31:15.023 --> 31:17.479
The cabinet has annulled its earlier action.

31:17.567 --> 31:21.647
I have instructed the Secret Service
to resume its charge of serving you

31:21.738 --> 31:24.573
as President of the United States.

31:25.534 --> 31:26.909
I see.

31:26.993 --> 31:31.406
I've also tendered my resignation,
effective immediately,

31:31.498 --> 31:37.501
and those members of the cabinet who voted
against you have also agreed to resign.

31:40.048 --> 31:42.124
Jim.

31:44.094 --> 31:46.086
Gentlemen, ladies...

31:49.307 --> 31:51.633
we came dangerously close to war today.

31:53.145 --> 31:57.605
That all of us reacted emotionally
to the nuclear detonation is understandable.

31:59.192 --> 32:04.317
But leaders are required
to have patience beyond human limits.

32:06.408 --> 32:11.034
The kind of action we nearly took
should only be exercised

32:11.121 --> 32:14.786
after all other avenues have been exhausted.

32:16.334 --> 32:20.831
After the strictest standard
of proof has been met.

32:22.382 --> 32:28.717
By casting me aside so quickly,
you effectively lowered those standards.

32:28.805 --> 32:31.427
And that was a profound mistake.

32:43.570 --> 32:48.315
It was not, however,
a mistake you're likely to make again.

32:49.326 --> 32:52.861
Therefore I do not accept your resignations.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.042
We have a nation to heal today.

32:59.294 --> 33:03.707
And all of you play a vital role
in that healing process.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.174
Mr President...

33:11.098 --> 33:13.671
I don't know what to say.

33:14.851 --> 33:16.891
There's nothing to say.

33:17.938 --> 33:19.562
We have work to do.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.477
That'll be all.

33:28.949 --> 33:31.321
- Jenny, set up a press conference.
- When?

33:31.409 --> 33:34.114
As soon as you can. And I want it public.

33:34.204 --> 33:39.364
I want to speak to the people directly.
They deserve my assurance.

33:39.459 --> 33:41.582
Yes, sir.

33:45.340 --> 33:50.880
Mike, I wanna thank you again
for calling CTU in the 11th hour.

33:52.722 --> 33:55.759
Of course, Mr President.

34:01.982 --> 34:04.520
But you should have been with me to the end.

34:06.611 --> 34:08.900
That's what I expected of you.

34:09.739 --> 34:12.360
That's why I appointed you.

34:21.793 --> 34:26.335
I'm relieving you of your post,
effective immediately.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.295
Yes, Mr President.

34:50.655 --> 34:54.237
Thank you, sir.
I can't take all the credit myself.

34:54.326 --> 34:58.573
It's a great team
George Mason put together here.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.989
Yes, I will. Thank you, sir.

35:03.043 --> 35:06.293
Tony. That was District Director Vaughn.

35:06.379 --> 35:10.543
He's so happy with what we did here today
he doesn't know where to start.

35:10.634 --> 35:12.840
That's great.

35:14.304 --> 35:17.340
So... what's up, my friend?

35:19.810 --> 35:21.802
Well, um...

35:24.314 --> 35:26.472
it's like this.

35:27.234 --> 35:29.060
Either fire me...

35:29.152 --> 35:31.690
or get out of my chair.

35:53.176 --> 35:55.667
The chair's all yours.

36:02.936 --> 36:04.929
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:06.440 --> 36:11.267
The new shift is here.
They've been brought up to speed.

36:11.361 --> 36:14.647
I was thinking I'd get
my brother and go home.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.404
Michelle, um...

36:23.290 --> 36:26.990
there's a handful of people
who made a big difference today.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.292
You're one of'em.

36:29.379 --> 36:34.041
You made some tough choices and
went up against me. You were right.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.588
Thanks.

36:39.765 --> 36:43.928
So, um... why don't you
go home and get some rest?

36:53.445 --> 36:55.105
Michelle.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.865
See you tomorrow.

37:22.349 --> 37:28.767
- I'll need to see the contents of your bag.
- I'm Kate Warner and this is Kim Bauer.

37:43.745 --> 37:45.821
Excuse me.

37:51.086 --> 37:53.577
- Hey, honey.
- Daddy.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.844
It's gonna be all right.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.510
I know.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.515
I love you.

38:18.989 --> 38:20.981
I love you too.

38:34.212 --> 38:37.130
Dad? I'm gonna take care of you.

38:49.186 --> 38:51.474
I urge you in the strongest terms

38:51.563 --> 38:57.566
not to indulge any rumours or theories
that you may have heard, or may soon hear.

38:58.361 --> 39:02.608
Once the facts are known,
I will present them to you myself.

39:02.699 --> 39:08.488
Until then, know that we are all safe
and that we will continue to be safe.

39:10.749 --> 39:17.119
The most patriotic thing that we can all do
today is to keep living our lives.

39:17.214 --> 39:22.291
So I urge you all, go back to work,
go back to school.

39:23.303 --> 39:27.431
Because the freedom we enjoy,
the freedom that we earn every day,

39:27.516 --> 39:32.593
is the very thing that will defeat
our enemies and keep us strong.

39:33.688 --> 39:35.681
God bless America.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.731
God bless us all. Thank you.

39:42.948 --> 39:46.233
Thank you very much. God bless you.

39:47.244 --> 39:50.245
Thank you. Thank you.

39:51.039 --> 39:54.159
Thank you. Good to see you.

39:54.251 --> 39:56.789
Thank you. Thank you.

40:05.137 --> 40:08.091
Thank you. Thank you.

40:08.181 --> 40:10.470
Thank you.

40:11.852 --> 40:13.975
Mr President!

40:17.482 --> 40:19.439
Hi.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.227
Excuse me, Mr President.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.602
Thank you.

40:24.698 --> 40:26.406
Mr President.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.151
- Hi.
- Thank you.

40:31.872 --> 40:34.873
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.973
- Yes.
- It's done.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.273
Thank you.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.572
Mr President?

42:04.923 --> 42:10.510
The president's down!
We need medical assistance. Help!

42:13.265 --> 42:16.681
Mr President?

42:16.768 --> 42:19.805
Mr President? It'll be all right, sir.

42:19.896 --> 42:22.103
We need an ambulance! Help!

42:23.305 --> 42:29.180
