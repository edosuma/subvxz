Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.086 --> 00:06.003
What do you want to
do tonight, Cliff?

00:06.004 --> 00:07.054
Eh, I don't know.

00:07.106 --> 00:08.606
What do you want to do?

00:08.674 --> 00:09.908
I don't know.

00:09.909 --> 00:10.825
You guys!

00:10.826 --> 00:13.161
You do this
all day long for hours.

00:13.163 --> 00:14.746
Face it, Rebecca, we're bored.

00:14.813 --> 00:17.382
Nothing ever happens
around here.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.168
(steady beeping, Rebecca gasps)

00:20.286 --> 00:22.037
Oh, my God!

00:22.121 --> 00:23.738
Hey, it's Andy Andy.

00:23.739 --> 00:25.006
What, you know this person?

00:25.007 --> 00:26.608
Yeah. Former major felon.

00:26.676 --> 00:28.309
Once killed a waitress.

00:28.310 --> 00:30.312
(beeping continues)
Where's Diane?

00:30.313 --> 00:32.246
I demand to see Diane!

00:32.314 --> 00:34.365
Well, Miss Chambers
hasn't worked here

00:34.417 --> 00:35.750
in five or six years.

00:35.768 --> 00:37.935
Oh, really?

00:38.003 --> 00:39.604
Well...

00:39.672 --> 00:41.273
okay.

00:45.695 --> 00:47.946

Well, well, well, so Maggie
O'Keefe is back in town, huh?

02:08.511 --> 02:11.613
Couldn't get enough of
the Old Clavin monster, I guess.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.848
Who's-who's Maggie O'Keefe?

02:13.916 --> 02:15.684
That's Cliff's old girlfriend.

02:15.751 --> 02:17.385
I'm sorry, Cliff's what?

02:20.022 --> 02:22.623
Oh, no, no, no, I've been
thinking about you, too.

02:22.691 --> 02:24.125
What?

02:24.193 --> 02:27.629
Aw, come on, I can't say
that in front of the guys.

02:27.696 --> 02:28.863
All right.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.900
I love you, too.

02:31.968 --> 02:34.736
That was Ma!
Maggie's back in town!

02:34.737 --> 02:39.124
So, how long has it been
since you've seen Maggie?

02:39.125 --> 02:40.175
Oh, about six months.

02:40.242 --> 02:43.677
She, uh, skipped off to Canada
for a while, you know, and...

02:43.678 --> 02:45.964
according to Ma,
she's back in town, wants to see me.

02:45.965 --> 02:51.068
I guess she's just looking for
a booster shot of "vitamin CC."

02:51.170 --> 02:53.700
Yeah, maybe things just
didn't work out in Canada.

02:53.701 --> 02:55.056
Yeah, I'll never forget when

02:55.057 --> 02:58.760
my Uncle Orlo left Hanover to
seek his fortune in the big city.

02:58.827 --> 03:00.327
You know what happened?

03:00.395 --> 03:03.297
Terre Haute just
chewed him up and spit him out.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.237
Yep, he came back
with his head between his legs.

03:09.305 --> 03:12.707
Actually, I think the
expression is "tail between his legs."

03:12.742 --> 03:18.079
Oh, no, there was
a train accident on the way back.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.430
Yep.

03:19.448 --> 03:21.615
It's a real tragedy.

03:21.683 --> 03:25.619
Yeah, a year later,
he drowned in a sitz bath.

03:26.923 --> 03:28.506
Guess what I kept seeing

03:28.574 --> 03:31.259
as I was driving
into work just now.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.584
The middle finger
of every driver in Boston?

03:38.350 --> 03:41.819
No. The new ad campaign
for Gary's Old Towne Tavern.

03:41.887 --> 03:45.197
He's got billboards,
buses, tops of taxis, he's got everything.

03:45.198 --> 03:47.892
I'm telling you that guy's
business is gonna double.

03:47.893 --> 03:50.328
Yeah? Well, what
am I supposed to do?

03:50.329 --> 03:52.296
Well, I think that we
should do some advertising.

03:52.297 --> 03:54.365
Maybe we should do a
commercial on the radio,

03:54.366 --> 03:56.534
you know, a jingle,
something real catchy.

03:56.535 --> 03:59.053
No, I don't want to do
a jingle- that's stupid.

03:59.054 --> 04:00.905
You know, Sammy's
right there, Becs.

04:00.906 --> 04:03.076
What you want is a
word-of-mouth campaign.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.559
I'd be happy to help, you know.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.794
I'll talk it up
down at the old post office.

04:06.912 --> 04:08.596
Before you know it,

04:08.597 --> 04:10.598
this place will be wall-to-wall

I'm gonna hook you up

04:28.818 --> 04:29.984

04:31.404 --> 04:33.854
We should probably
talk about budget now.

04:33.922 --> 04:34.989
Yes.

04:35.074 --> 04:38.142
I am prepared to spend
as much as $200.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.279
Keep Jason.

Somebody wake up Sy Flembeck.

04:45.534 --> 04:46.851
Oh, advertising.

04:46.852 --> 04:48.853
You know, I almost
went into advertising.

04:48.854 --> 04:51.656
I bet that I would've
been real good at it,

04:51.757 --> 04:54.275
because I am
really good with, um...

Oh, God, what is that when
you call and people are...

04:56.611 --> 04:58.847
you get two people and
they're talking to each other?

04:58.848 --> 05:00.298
You mean communication?
Yes!

05:00.299 --> 05:02.667
I have a real
knack for that. Oh.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.203

05:08.907 --> 05:10.992
I gave this firm
the best years of my life.

05:10.993 --> 05:13.728
It turns around and kicks me right
in the old haemorrhoid hotel.

05:13.729 --> 05:15.363
Pardon my French, babe.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.681

Mr. Pimply-Faced Teenager

05:18.834 --> 05:20.668
Who's Running the Shop

05:20.669 --> 05:22.670

Sy, we've got a job for you.

05:30.179 --> 05:33.214
You didn't let me finish!

05:33.299 --> 05:36.884
You have to be that way,
'cause you're a leader!

05:36.952 --> 05:38.485

05:38.553 --> 05:42.489

Where's the old 88's?
Oh, right over here.

06:09.201 --> 06:11.902
Listen, do you think you can
write something for this place

06:11.903 --> 06:14.338
that's really gonna capture
the spirit of Cheers?

06:14.339 --> 06:16.274
But you have to do
it right away,

06:16.275 --> 06:18.776

lot of competition out there.

06:18.777 --> 06:20.244
Hey, let me ask you something.

Why don't you put a little
more pressure on me,

Well, uh, Paul,
I'm sure there's

07:11.730 --> 07:13.865
a very good reason
why she isn't here.

07:13.932 --> 07:15.299
Well, thank you, Carla.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.285
Namely that Clavin
dismembered her

07:17.352 --> 07:20.487
and stacked her in his freezer.

07:20.488 --> 07:21.589
Yeah, you know, the police

07:21.590 --> 07:23.580
took that call of yours
very seriously.

07:25.994 --> 07:27.428

07:27.496 --> 07:30.765
Missed a half a
day's work, thank you very much.

Poor Ma didn't know
what to think.

07:32.768 --> 07:34.101

07:35.220 --> 07:38.823
of Omaha steaks
trying to protect me.

07:38.841 --> 07:42.593
You must be pretty excited
to see Maggie, huh?

07:42.678 --> 07:44.445
Oh, yeah.
Darned excited, Sammy.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.280
Yeah, boy, when we're together,

07:46.348 --> 07:48.278
we're the hottest
couple imaginable.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.387
Yeah, I got the hormones,
the drive, the needs.

07:52.454 --> 07:55.756
Yes siree, yeah, my body's
like one big erogenous zone.

07:56.692 --> 07:59.527
Five, four, three...

07:59.562 --> 08:01.746
What are you
doing, Carla? Counting down.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.598
I'm about to launch my lunch.

08:06.001 --> 08:07.435
Oh! Oh, look at that!

08:07.437 --> 08:08.587
Here comes Maggie now.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.621
Yeah, well,
I'd just better stand firm.

08:10.622 --> 08:13.657
I mean, nobody ties Cliff Clavin
down, that's for sure.

08:13.725 --> 08:16.861
She can have me back,
but, uh, no commitments.

08:16.912 --> 08:18.312
Mark my words.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.714
Hey there, baby.

08:19.798 --> 08:21.532
Remember me?

08:21.584 --> 08:23.334
I sure do, Cliff.

08:24.753 --> 08:26.470
Or should I say "Daddy"?

08:39.101 --> 08:41.101
How is he?
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.820
Hey, how's
he doing there, Fras?

08:42.821 --> 08:43.988
Oh, better, I think.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.724
Carla volunteered to bathe
his face with cold water

08:46.792 --> 08:50.928
and was doing fine until
the seat came down on his head.

08:50.996 --> 08:53.764
I should go to him.

08:53.832 --> 08:56.701
No. Trust me,
I'm a doctor.

08:56.752 --> 08:58.192
I've seen many cases of shock.

08:58.236 --> 09:01.305
What I suggest that you do
is go out for a while,

09:01.373 --> 09:03.507
give Cliff time to
regain his composure,

09:03.575 --> 09:06.443
and then you can come
on back, sit down

09:06.511 --> 09:09.380
and have a nice little chat
with him about, uh...

09:09.447 --> 09:12.650
Well, whatever it is
you wish to discuss with him.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.251
Thank you, Doctor.

09:14.319 --> 09:17.438
Perhaps it was a bit much
to spring on him. Yes.

09:17.506 --> 09:20.692
Tell him I'll be back
in a little while. All right.

09:20.693 --> 09:25.329
Well, from our "things you never
thought you'd hear" category,

09:25.330 --> 09:28.482
that woman is carrying
Cliff's child.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.301
Come on, buddy.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.476
Where is she?

09:39.578 --> 09:41.448
She had to step out
for a little while.

09:41.479 --> 09:42.846
Hey! Ha! I'll be damned!

09:42.847 --> 09:45.333
Let me be the first
to congratulate you, Cliffie!

09:45.334 --> 09:46.617
Uh, thanks, Sam.

09:46.684 --> 09:49.153
You dog, Cliffie!

09:49.221 --> 09:51.989
Yeah.
I got to say, man, I'm shocked.

09:52.057 --> 09:54.391
How come?
Well, you know, I mean,

09:54.392 --> 09:56.678
you always claimed that
you and Margaret were,

09:56.679 --> 09:59.363
you know, doing it,
but, you know, I never really,

09:59.398 --> 10:01.498
you know...

10:02.817 --> 10:05.252
I'm just surprised,
is all, Cliff.

10:06.354 --> 10:09.423
So, she's pregnant
with your child.

10:09.441 --> 10:11.311
You gonna go through
Lamaze, or, uh,

10:11.376 --> 10:14.645
do you figure it'll just
burst out through her chest?

10:17.082 --> 10:19.349
Why'd you do it, Cliff?

10:19.418 --> 10:21.685
I begged you
to get yourself fixed.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.520
I even offered to pay for it.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.723
Hell, I offered
to do it for you!

10:25.791 --> 10:27.625
SAM:
Come on, come on, you guys.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.060
It's celebration time here!

10:29.061 --> 10:31.963
Hey, drinks on the house-
my friend's gonna be a daddy!

10:31.965 --> 10:34.031
OTHERS:
Yeah! Yeah!

10:34.098 --> 10:36.867
You are gonna marry her,
aren't you, Mr. Clavin?

10:36.935 --> 10:39.870
It'd be a shame
to have to stone her.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.240
Well, uh...

10:43.241 --> 10:45.409
I-I guess you do,
uh, things differently

10:45.410 --> 10:47.978
back there in Hanover,
don't you, Wood?

10:48.113 --> 10:49.964
America's Heartland.

10:49.965 --> 10:53.568
Well, I don't know,
I should have expected it.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.739
I mean, the, uh, Clavins
never fire blanks.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.557
We're breeders, spawners.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.176
My loins are brimming
with vitality.

11:04.479 --> 11:06.179
Well, I'll never eat again.

11:06.247 --> 11:08.015
Anybody else?

11:10.588 --> 11:13.554
Let's get your mother
on the phone

11:13.555 --> 11:14.889
and tell her about it, huh?

11:14.890 --> 11:16.157
Get her down here, we'll have
a little celebration.

11:16.158 --> 11:17.175
There you go.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.342
Good idea, Sammy.

11:18.409 --> 11:20.410
But, uh...

11:20.429 --> 11:23.030
What?

11:23.065 --> 11:24.999
Could I, could I see you?

11:30.406 --> 11:33.741
Well, uh, what do
you think Cliffie will have- a boy, a girl?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.993
Is there a third choice?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.012
Sammy, you know,

11:39.013 --> 11:41.082
I-I-I don't, uh,
I don't think that's my baby.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.783
Why not?

11:42.784 --> 11:44.652
Oh, well, let's
just say that, uh, you know,

11:44.653 --> 11:46.487
sometimes studs know.

11:48.806 --> 11:51.208
Remind me again how studs know.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.561
Well, you know,
sometimes studs just choose to...

11:53.562 --> 11:55.095
well, you know, wait it out.

11:55.130 --> 11:58.849
Cliff, you-you never actually
had sex with Maggie, did you?

11:58.850 --> 12:00.434
W-Well, that depends
there, Sam.

12:00.435 --> 12:01.969
Define sex.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.037
Oh...

12:03.038 --> 12:06.407
Now, you know,
we, uh, we meant to,

12:06.408 --> 12:08.642
but we just never really got
around to it, there, Sam.

12:08.643 --> 12:11.378
You, uh, still think
I'm a stud though, don't you?

12:11.446 --> 12:12.713
Oh, yes, of course I do.

12:12.714 --> 12:14.232
More than ever, man,
more than ever.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.300
Yeah. You know,
sometimes it takes, uh,

12:16.367 --> 12:19.970
it takes a bigger stud,
not to have sex.

12:20.038 --> 12:22.273
What the hell does that mean?

12:22.324 --> 12:24.825
I don't know, man.
I'm just trying to help you.

12:24.893 --> 12:26.527
Work with me here, will you?

12:26.578 --> 12:29.013
Aw, Sammy, I'm such a failure.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.647
I feel so ashamed of myself.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.129
No, no, don't do that, Cliff.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.651
You know, uh, lots of people
don't have sex on dates.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.388
Hell, I've dated lots of women,
never had sex with them.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.639
That's kind of hard to believe
there, Sammy.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.630
You're not working
with me here, Cliff.

12:40.675 --> 12:41.975
Let's, uh... Wait a second.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.478
I don't get something here.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.179
Now, if it's not your kid,

12:45.180 --> 12:47.882
how come Maggie's
coming in here and calling you "Daddy"?

12:47.883 --> 12:48.933
Uh, that's easy.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.135
She's setting up a trap for me.

12:51.136 --> 12:53.337
All right, put yourself
in the frame of mind

12:53.338 --> 12:54.538
of the female psyche.

12:54.539 --> 12:56.640
Now, she goes off,
gets herself pregnant,

12:56.641 --> 12:59.076
looking for a husband,
provider, best friend, lover.

12:59.077 --> 13:01.845
Okay? First name
on top of her wish list.

13:01.914 --> 13:06.850
Cliff Clavin?

13:06.919 --> 13:10.154
Bingo.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.556
So, what do you think, Sam?

13:12.624 --> 13:15.394
I mean, I-I don't know
if I'm ready to get married or not.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.194
Well, you don't have to.
It's not your kid.

13:17.195 --> 13:18.396
It's not your responsibility.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.031
Yeah, but, you know,
I was out there

13:20.032 --> 13:21.799
in front of the guys braggin'
about my sexual prowess.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.700
Well, hell,
they don't have to find out about this.

13:23.701 --> 13:25.353
You know it's none
of their business.

13:25.354 --> 13:26.721
Well, yeah,
but what do I tell them?

13:26.722 --> 13:30.224
Tell them, uh, that you weighed
the pros and cons,

13:30.225 --> 13:31.758
and at this point in your life,

13:31.759 --> 13:34.111
you don't feel like marriage
is the right thing for you.

13:34.112 --> 13:36.347
Hey, that's great,
Sammy, great. Thank you.

13:36.348 --> 13:37.448
Yeah. Yeah.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.849
Hey, stud handshake.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.902
Uh, oh, well.. Oh!
All right.

13:40.969 --> 13:42.136
There you go.

13:42.693 --> 13:44.654
Hey, uh, listen, Sam,

13:44.655 --> 13:46.457
just to, uh, you know,
set the record straight,

13:46.458 --> 13:47.958
just 'cause I didn't have
sex with Margaret,

13:47.959 --> 13:49.994
uh, doesn't mean I haven't
bagged my share of chicks.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.944
No, I know that.

13:50.945 --> 13:52.246
I know you do.

13:52.247 --> 13:53.196
I'm a pretty sexy guy.

13:53.197 --> 13:55.033
You know, women
sort of pick up on that.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.434
Yeah.

13:56.501 --> 13:57.901
Want to know my secret?

13:57.953 --> 13:59.620
Don't wear any underwear.

13:59.688 --> 14:00.768
It's too restraining.

14:02.707 --> 14:05.342
That's, that's super, man.
Thank you.

14:05.410 --> 14:06.877
Thank you for sharing that.

14:07.609 --> 14:11.015
I've got a little
announcement to make.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.933
Margaret and I will
not be getting married.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.584
See, I've weighed
the pros and the cons...

14:14.585 --> 14:15.986
That's not your kid, is it?

14:16.054 --> 14:17.104
Uh, no.

14:17.155 --> 14:18.388
See I've weighed...

14:18.456 --> 14:20.891
You and Maggie didn't
do it, did you?

14:20.959 --> 14:24.161
Well, no.

14:24.229 --> 14:26.263
(laughs)

14:30.035 --> 14:32.936
Look, I didn't tell you guys
'cause I didn't want you to,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.771
you know, think any less of me.

14:34.823 --> 14:37.558
Oh, I don't think that's
actually possible, Cliff.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.877
Thank you, big guy.

14:43.381 --> 14:44.948
Hey, babe!

14:45.000 --> 14:46.534
Your ship just came in!

14:46.535 --> 14:48.101
The muse has visited
Sy Flembeck.

14:48.102 --> 14:50.003
Want to hear what
she had to say?

14:50.071 --> 14:51.204
Oh, boy, do I.

14:51.272 --> 14:54.074
You know, I just love
the whole creative process.

14:54.142 --> 14:56.310
And I can be pretty
creative myself.

14:56.344 --> 14:59.163
Oh, yeah?
Well, then why don't you be Sy Flembeck

14:59.230 --> 15:01.460
and I'll be the
annoying broad? How's that?

15:02.651 --> 15:03.784
Go ahead.

15:03.852 --> 15:05.086
All right.

15:05.153 --> 15:07.855
"The Cheers Theme"

That's all wrong!

15:26.407 --> 15:29.409
First of all, "Cheers" is
spelled with two E's.

15:32.380 --> 15:35.416
Second, I paid you
a lot of money

15:35.483 --> 15:37.184
to come up with
an original tune.

15:37.268 --> 15:38.958
You don't need
an original tune!

15:38.959 --> 15:40.688
You want something
that'll bore a hole

15:40.689 --> 15:42.556

little pea brains.

15:42.557 --> 15:44.624
But you are all hype
and no substance!

15:44.692 --> 15:48.128
I was mesmerized
by your show business savvy.

15:48.196 --> 15:51.715
You couldn't write a jingle
to save your life.

What? What?
The "Old MacDonald" melody?

15:57.956 --> 15:59.689
Hey, I could change that.

15:59.690 --> 16:02.126
Yeah, Sy Flembeck is nothing
if he's not versatile.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.028

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, Maggie.
Thanks.

17:11.646 --> 17:13.547
I'm sorry I was gone
for so long.

17:13.615 --> 17:17.017
I went out and had some pizza
and ribs

17:17.085 --> 17:21.055
and ice cream
and pickles and chocolate.

17:21.071 --> 17:22.640
Maybe it's Norm's kid.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.580
Maggie, uh, I'd like to
talk to you in private

17:29.648 --> 17:30.814
for a few minutes.

17:30.882 --> 17:33.232
Do you mind, uh, stepping,
uh, this way, here?

17:33.284 --> 17:35.786
Uh, Sammy, okay if we, uh,

17:35.787 --> 17:36.970
use your office there, buddy?

17:36.971 --> 17:39.473
Promise me you won't go
through my drawers?

17:39.591 --> 17:40.741
Yeah, okay, I won't.

17:40.742 --> 17:42.092
That's what you said last time.

17:42.093 --> 17:43.963
How many times
can I say "I'm sorry"?

17:46.648 --> 17:48.649
Here, have a seat
there, Maggie.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.320
Maggie,

17:53.321 --> 17:55.506
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Maggie
there's, uh, so much

17:55.507 --> 17:59.109
I want to say to you and...
so much you want to say

17:59.160 --> 18:00.810
to me, and...

18:00.862 --> 18:02.096
so...

18:02.163 --> 18:03.697
Holy cow!

18:03.765 --> 18:05.755
For a guy who's always
crying poverty,

18:05.767 --> 18:09.069
Sam Malone's doing pretty well
for himself.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.821
Cliff?

18:11.873 --> 18:13.874
Oh, yeah.

18:13.942 --> 18:16.076
You know, Maggie,
I've been thinking.

18:16.177 --> 18:17.761
And you and I both know that

18:17.829 --> 18:19.863
that baby
couldn't possibly be mine.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.516
(sobbing)

18:24.602 --> 18:25.836
Aw, Maggie.

18:25.904 --> 18:28.321
Cliff, I am so ashamed.

18:28.389 --> 18:30.423
You're right.
The baby isn't yours.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.794
I just didn't know
where else to turn.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.595
Well, what happened, Maggie?

18:35.647 --> 18:37.647
Well, um, up in Canada,

18:37.715 --> 18:39.450
I met a man and fell in love.

18:39.517 --> 18:41.418
And everything was perfect,

18:41.452 --> 18:43.153
and we were gonna get married.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.223
And then he got scared
and called everything off.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.809
And I didn't have anyone
to turn to,

18:48.877 --> 18:51.695
so of course,
I thought of the most decent,

18:51.763 --> 18:53.613
honourable man I know.

18:53.682 --> 18:55.949
I'm sorry, Cliff.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.636
You know, you...

18:58.703 --> 19:01.705
you just run out on me,
and you meet this guy,

19:01.773 --> 19:03.774
get pregnant, and he dumps you,

19:03.841 --> 19:05.476
and you come back

19:05.543 --> 19:08.044
so old Cliff Clavin can
take care of you, huh?

19:08.096 --> 19:11.165
That's right, Cliff.

19:11.232 --> 19:13.299
Can do.

19:13.351 --> 19:16.086
What?!

19:16.154 --> 19:18.088
I will marry you, Margaret!

19:18.156 --> 19:19.956
Oh, thank you, Cliff!

19:20.024 --> 19:21.558
(both chuckle)

19:21.576 --> 19:23.760
Hey, here's a
little-known fact:

19:23.828 --> 19:26.129
I'm gonna be your daddy!

19:26.197 --> 19:29.566
You know, this isn't
exactly the way I, you know, dreamed about

19:29.634 --> 19:31.902
starting a family there,
Maggie, but, uh...

19:31.903 --> 19:33.820
you know, I've always
thought the world of you.

19:33.821 --> 19:36.323
And I know that you'd
do the same for me

19:36.391 --> 19:38.858
if the situations
were reversed.

19:40.828 --> 19:42.629
But, Cliff, how could the...

19:42.696 --> 19:44.731
Never mind.

19:44.799 --> 19:47.067
All right.
So, hey, look, here's what we do.

19:47.068 --> 19:49.035
We, uh, skedaddle down
to the City Hall,

19:49.036 --> 19:51.372
make this thing legal,
and we go over to my place,

19:51.373 --> 19:53.240
sedate Ma and give
her the good news.

19:53.274 --> 19:54.641
Huh? Huh?!

19:54.709 --> 19:57.010
Okay!

19:57.011 --> 19:59.830
Oh, let me just call Jerry
and tell him he's off the hook

19:59.831 --> 20:01.699
so he won't worry about me
anymore.

20:01.766 --> 20:04.735
Uh, is it okay to use
this phone to call long distance?

20:04.803 --> 20:06.970
Oh, yeah, sure.
I do it all the time.

20:09.824 --> 20:12.226
Well, Sammy,
champagne all around.

20:12.293 --> 20:13.560
ALL:
Hey!

20:13.561 --> 20:15.428
Yeah, I decided
to marry Margaret, you know,

20:15.429 --> 20:17.064
make an honest woman of her

20:17.081 --> 20:18.849
and, uh, raise her child
as my own.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.216
SAM:
Oh, that's great.

20:20.217 --> 20:21.468
Congratulations, Cliff.

20:21.469 --> 20:24.471
I know you'll enjoy reaping
the rewards of fatherhood.

20:24.472 --> 20:26.006
Yeah, it's not like
I'm not prepared.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.208
I mean, I do own a copy
of The Little Mermaid.

20:28.259 --> 20:31.328
Well, let me be the first
to propose a toast.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.262
CLIFF:
All right.

20:32.263 --> 20:33.597
To the new father,
Cliff Clavin.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.265
ALL:
To the new father!

20:35.332 --> 20:36.966
Thank you, gentlemen.

20:37.034 --> 20:38.702
Cliff.

20:38.703 --> 20:39.803
Ha! Excuse me.

20:39.804 --> 20:43.573
(quietly):
The old ball and chain.

20:43.641 --> 20:45.742
Cliff, I just talked to Jerry.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.861
I hope you told him
that a real man

20:47.928 --> 20:50.464
is going to, uh,
take care of you and the baby?

20:50.498 --> 20:53.167
He wants me back.

20:53.201 --> 20:54.984
Beg your pardon?

20:55.036 --> 20:56.636
He said he loves me.

20:56.637 --> 20:58.905
He can't stand the thought of
another man raising his child.

20:58.906 --> 21:02.509
So, you're off the hook.

21:02.577 --> 21:03.777
Aren't you happy?

21:03.845 --> 21:05.946
Well, if you're happy.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.147
I'm happy.

21:08.683 --> 21:10.550
Well, then I'm happy.
Yeah...

21:10.552 --> 21:12.769
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.354
Please, don't just sit there.

21:14.472 --> 21:16.823
Raise your glasses
in a toast to, uh,

21:16.891 --> 21:20.026
Mother Margaret here and,
uh, the new father, Jerry.

21:20.111 --> 21:22.045
Jerry?

21:22.046 --> 21:23.447
ALL (lacklustre):
To Jerry.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.465
Thanks, everyone.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.667
Oh, uh-uh, Cliff,
would you mind

21:27.668 --> 21:29.436
giving me a ride
to the bus station?

21:29.437 --> 21:32.206
If I leave now, I can
be there in 72 hours.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.840
Yeah, sure.

21:34.104 --> 21:36.677
I'm a little confused, Sam.

21:36.678 --> 21:39.213
Well, Maggie's going back
to Canada

21:39.280 --> 21:41.648
to marry the,
the father of her baby.

21:41.649 --> 21:43.266
And Cliff was going
to marry her,

21:43.267 --> 21:44.768
but now he doesn't have to.

21:44.836 --> 21:48.071
No, I mean about it taking
72 hours to get to Canada.

21:50.407 --> 21:52.397
I thought it was much
further than that.

21:53.561 --> 21:55.362
You know, Cliff, in a way,

21:55.430 --> 21:58.532
I'm a little disappointed
that we're not getting married.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.701
We'll never make love again.

22:00.735 --> 22:03.070
Again?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.139
Maggie, I think your
memory is as, uh, faulty

22:05.140 --> 22:08.474
as your birth control, uh...

22:09.861 --> 22:12.045
We, we never actually
did make love.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.547
Sure we did.
The night before I left.

22:14.615 --> 22:19.686
Remember?
You had those two wine coolers?

22:19.754 --> 22:21.555
No kiddin'?

22:21.622 --> 22:23.990
I-I thought I
fell asleep.

22:25.193 --> 22:28.228
You, you mean, you
and I actually, uh...?

22:29.430 --> 22:31.565
I don't remember.

22:31.632 --> 22:33.567
Boy, that's something.

22:33.634 --> 22:36.470
So, uh, how was I?

22:36.471 --> 22:37.437
The truth, Cliff?

22:37.438 --> 22:38.538
Naw.

22:38.606 --> 22:40.207
You were great.
Yeah!

22:40.274 --> 22:41.942
(laughing)

22:42.009 --> 22:44.411
Both times.
Both times! Wow!

22:44.529 --> 22:45.595
Wow! Whoo-hoo!
