WEBVTT

00:00.057 --> 00:01.632
You left your foster brother,

00:01.693 --> 00:03.808
a known felon,
off your PHQ.

00:03.895 --> 00:06.300
I have a lot to be sorry for.
And I am.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.360
I need someone here
to be my eyes and ears.

00:08.448 --> 00:10.379
You want me to be a rat
for Internal Affairs?

00:10.467 --> 00:12.590
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Your father.

00:12.678 --> 00:14.002
Not the one that
I thought you were.

00:14.089 --> 00:15.700
- We can cut him off in the plaza.
- Wait!

00:15.787 --> 00:17.040
Brake!

00:18.724 --> 00:20.707
When I pushed
to be something I'm not,

00:20.795 --> 00:21.981
I almost got someone
killed.

00:22.069 --> 00:23.942
The least impressive thing
about you

00:24.030 --> 00:26.573
is you're dating
a 45-year-old rookie.

00:26.692 --> 00:27.919
What's wrong with that?

00:28.007 --> 00:30.442
Until I administer
the oral exam,

00:30.530 --> 00:32.247
get the hell
out of my office.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.673
What's a 314?

00:38.761 --> 00:39.917
Uh, indecent exposure.

00:40.005 --> 00:41.559
Nice. A 273g?

00:41.647 --> 00:43.638
Being intoxicated
in the presence of a child.

00:43.726 --> 00:45.294
Well done.
Reminds me of a funny story.

00:45.385 --> 00:46.967
- Mm, mm-hmm, uh-huh.
- Which is for later.

00:47.054 --> 00:48.825
- How about a 237?
- False imprisonment.

00:48.925 --> 00:52.378
Nicely done, and a personal
favorite of mine... a 597h.

00:52.474 --> 00:54.877
Unlawfully attaching
a propeller to an animal

00:54.965 --> 00:56.419
so that dogs
may chase it.

00:56.507 --> 00:59.386
Well done. That's 500 penal
codes down, 1,000 to go.

00:59.481 --> 01:01.442
- Curly fries?
- Yes. - Definitely.

01:03.004 --> 01:04.254
Money. Now.

01:04.385 --> 01:06.364
211, armed robbery.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.286
488, petty theft.

01:08.374 --> 01:10.395
- You a cop?
- Yes, I am. And so are they.

01:10.483 --> 01:11.816
Hands in the air.
Drop your guns.

01:11.904 --> 01:13.277
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.157
You guys, this looks to me like
a criminal conspiracy.

01:16.291 --> 01:17.547
You mean a 182.

01:17.635 --> 01:18.849
Also a 12-0-20.

01:18.937 --> 01:20.481
Oh, illegal possession
of a firearm.

01:20.569 --> 01:23.489
Actually, it's a 417.
The guns are fake.

01:26.074 --> 01:27.694
Ha!
He's right!

01:27.782 --> 01:30.207
Yep, but this knife's real,
and that's a violation of...

01:30.295 --> 01:31.929
- 21510 B.
- 21510 B.

01:32.017 --> 01:34.351
- <i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>
- Turn around.

01:34.438 --> 01:35.726
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪</i>

01:35.845 --> 01:37.702
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>

01:43.874 --> 01:45.569
You are trouble.

01:46.624 --> 01:47.891
Why is that?

01:47.979 --> 01:49.937
'Cause I'm supposed to be
focused on this test,

01:50.025 --> 01:53.007
and all I can... think about...
Oh, my God... is you.

01:53.095 --> 01:55.138
And now you're gonna be
moving here full time.

01:55.554 --> 01:58.378
Yeah, well, that job
at Homeland Security

01:58.465 --> 02:00.030
was too good to pass up.

02:00.339 --> 02:03.507
Plus, decent benefits.

02:03.595 --> 02:04.812
Oh.

02:04.998 --> 02:06.054
- Oh.
- Oh.

02:06.142 --> 02:07.413
Oh.

02:07.830 --> 02:09.823
Come house hunting with me
this weekend.

02:09.911 --> 02:11.960
Yeah, sounds fun.
I'd love to.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.841
Oh, uh, Henry's flying in.
You two can finally meet.

02:15.045 --> 02:16.328
Is that too soon?

02:16.416 --> 02:18.851
I'm sorry. I have no idea
the single dad rules yet.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.827
No, no.
It's... It's fine.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.123
Um...

02:22.225 --> 02:24.098
I'd... I'd...
I'd like to meet him.

02:24.286 --> 02:25.569
- Great.
- Yeah, good.

02:25.657 --> 02:26.804
Okay. I gotta go.

02:26.892 --> 02:30.116
You are gonna do great
on your test.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.783
- Thank you.
- Okay?

02:39.925 --> 02:41.523
Officer Bishop.

02:42.261 --> 02:43.674
Glad you called.

02:43.762 --> 02:45.444
I was worried
you were ignoring me.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.960
No, ma'am.
I was just weighing my options.

02:48.216 --> 02:49.538
And?

02:52.815 --> 02:55.207
You promise I'll be cleared
by the Chief

02:55.295 --> 02:56.835
if I spy on
my fellow officers?

02:56.923 --> 02:58.507
Don't look at it
as spying.

02:58.618 --> 03:01.608
You're helping me monitor cops
who cross the line.

03:02.069 --> 03:03.960
Like the line
you're crossing with me.

03:04.097 --> 03:06.640
Violating the Peace Officers
Bill of Rights.

03:07.475 --> 03:08.827
What are you doing?

03:09.027 --> 03:11.038
I thought hard
about your offer,

03:11.271 --> 03:14.226
but I decided to go
a different way.

03:14.857 --> 03:16.593
By calling your boss.

03:17.663 --> 03:18.878
Sir, I can explain.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.069
You can try.

03:20.157 --> 03:21.312
But I recommend
you do it

03:21.412 --> 03:24.187
after consulting
your union lawyer.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.468
I've spoken
to the Chief.

03:27.576 --> 03:30.288
Your case has been closed,
Officer Bishop.

03:30.582 --> 03:33.819
A formal letter of reprimand
will be placed in your file.

03:34.143 --> 03:38.476
My apologies for Officer Ruiz's
rogue actions.

03:39.055 --> 03:40.175
Let's go.

03:44.294 --> 03:47.194
Letter of reprimand...
Fair resolution.

03:47.315 --> 03:48.546
Should be grateful.

03:48.655 --> 03:50.093
I am.

03:51.351 --> 03:52.804
Good.

03:55.981 --> 03:57.917
80 might be
the passing grade, Boot,

03:58.005 --> 03:59.172
but if you don't get
at least a 90,

03:59.259 --> 04:01.003
you should turn in your badge
on general principle.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.843
Officer Chen, I will take it
as a personal insult

04:03.931 --> 04:06.174
- if you get anything less than a 93.
- Yes, sir.

04:06.262 --> 04:07.885
Have you figured out
what you're gonna do

04:07.973 --> 04:09.057
with all your new
free time?

04:09.145 --> 04:10.608
Might I suggest
a book club?

04:10.696 --> 04:11.757
What are you
talking about?

04:11.886 --> 04:13.390
You know, after I pass,

04:13.770 --> 04:16.648
there won't be any more
daily evaluations to write.

04:16.932 --> 04:19.214
Whether I evaluate you
daily or weekly,

04:19.303 --> 04:21.523
I will continue to judge you
every minute.

04:21.611 --> 04:24.085
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

04:24.424 --> 04:27.608
So, all right.
Big day ahead.

04:28.069 --> 04:31.804
Rookies will work the first six
hours of their shift on patrol,

04:31.892 --> 04:33.585
then come back
to take the written test.

04:33.821 --> 04:36.184
Hey, try not to tire them out
this morning.

04:36.303 --> 04:37.676
Just take
the easy calls, okay?

04:37.786 --> 04:39.296
I don't do easy.

04:41.905 --> 04:44.272
But you do follow
direct orders,

04:44.465 --> 04:46.838
am I right,
Officer Bradford?

04:47.022 --> 04:48.168
Yes, sir.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.878
Good.

04:49.965 --> 04:51.529
Easy, then.

04:52.510 --> 04:54.123
Following
the written exam,

04:54.211 --> 04:56.674
you three will report
to the Chief's office,

04:56.762 --> 04:59.715
where he will personally
administer the oral exam.

04:59.862 --> 05:03.389
Remember, he can fail you for
a dozen different reasons, so...

05:04.332 --> 05:06.531
Remind me, Officer Nolan,
how the Chief feels about you.

05:06.618 --> 05:08.225
Oh, big fan, sir.

05:08.313 --> 05:10.115
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:10.407 --> 05:12.670
All right, see you three
back here in six hours.

05:12.845 --> 05:14.240
All right, that's it.

05:17.927 --> 05:19.417
You're driving today,
Officer West.

05:19.505 --> 05:20.922
I am? Why?

05:21.010 --> 05:22.882
'Cause we both know
you're gonna pass the exam.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.223
I mean, I feel
pretty good, but...

05:25.311 --> 05:28.117
The rules and regulations of
the LAPD are part of your DNA.

05:28.507 --> 05:31.039
You're right.
Test's in the bag.

05:31.314 --> 05:33.343
Which means I have today
to decide whether

05:33.431 --> 05:35.789
to request you be assigned
to a new training officer.

05:35.925 --> 05:38.005
What? Why?

05:40.017 --> 05:42.109
Because I feel like
I failed you.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.063
You were a mess
right out of the gate.

05:44.229 --> 05:46.234
And I thought
I got you past it.

05:46.493 --> 05:48.656
But then you lost it again
last week.

05:48.855 --> 05:50.781
So either you're falling down
or I am.

05:50.869 --> 05:52.872
What happened last week
was my fault.

05:53.033 --> 05:55.289
I let my family drama
get in the way, and...

05:56.048 --> 05:58.304
- it won't happen again.
- It's not good enough.

05:58.437 --> 05:59.758
You shouldn't still
be struggling with

05:59.845 --> 06:02.093
the most basic question...
"Why am I here?"

06:02.617 --> 06:04.765
Why do you want to be a cop,
Officer West?

06:05.484 --> 06:07.562
Because I've always
wanted to be one.

06:08.916 --> 06:12.172
Being groomed for this
isn't the same as choosing it.

06:12.652 --> 06:14.773
You gotta want this job
for the right reason.

06:15.032 --> 06:17.531
For you,
not your father.

06:18.234 --> 06:20.015
So, why did you
choose it?

06:25.365 --> 06:27.224
I have
four older brothers.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.159
Guess it gave me
a pathological need

06:29.247 --> 06:30.869
to stand up
for the little guy.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.354
Which is why I was also
willing to dig deep with you.

06:33.442 --> 06:36.443
But maybe I've given you
too much leash.

06:36.659 --> 06:38.120
Maybe you need
a different instructor

06:38.208 --> 06:39.349
to get your head on
straight.

06:39.437 --> 06:41.943
I don't want
a different instructor.

06:42.396 --> 06:44.427
Look, just tell me
what I have to do.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.552
You never got
a real Plain Clothes Day.

06:48.019 --> 06:50.917
So this morning
you're gonna run things.

06:52.463 --> 06:54.206
Then we'll see
what happens.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.917
<i>7-Adam-19,

07:00.005 --> 07:02.218

07:07.389 --> 07:09.596
Tell me!
Tell me right now!

07:09.684 --> 07:11.628
How the hell
did you know?!

07:11.716 --> 07:12.761
Answer me!

07:12.849 --> 07:15.142
Police.
Drop the snow globe.

07:15.230 --> 07:16.813
That's a $900
crystal ball.

07:16.901 --> 07:18.724
Can he just
put it down instead?

07:19.081 --> 07:21.135
You heard her.
Gently.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.995
Up against the wall.
Turn around.

07:25.986 --> 07:27.462
Ma'am, you okay?

07:27.795 --> 07:29.282
Yeah.

07:29.485 --> 07:30.998
I was just giving
that psycho a reading,

07:31.085 --> 07:32.587
and he hulked out.

07:32.675 --> 07:33.876
Don't say another word.

07:33.964 --> 07:36.048
We've got psychic-client
confidentiality.

07:36.136 --> 07:37.899
That's not a thing,
asshat.

07:37.987 --> 07:39.356
So, what exactly
were you telling him

07:39.443 --> 07:40.441
when he attacked you?

07:40.529 --> 07:41.783
We were talking about
his love life.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.110
I said I saw an image of him
and a beautiful woman

07:44.198 --> 07:46.165
surrounded by trees,
and then he freaked out.

07:46.253 --> 07:48.454
Why is that, sir?
Strike a little close to home?

07:48.542 --> 07:49.956
Have you been in the woods
with a woman recently?

07:50.043 --> 07:52.071
No, it was just
a misunderstanding.

07:53.317 --> 07:55.020
Control,
run a name for me.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.401
Last name Fischer,
first name Randy L.

08:02.385 --> 08:04.079

08:04.251 --> 08:05.378
Hands behind your back.

08:05.465 --> 08:07.298
Holy crap.
I was just making that up.

08:07.385 --> 08:08.423
You were?

08:08.511 --> 08:10.009
You think if I were
really psychic

08:10.097 --> 08:11.393
that I'd be working out
of a moldy storefront

08:11.480 --> 08:12.634
in Hollywood?

08:13.319 --> 08:17.102
Although, I can totally see us
destroying my bedroom later.

08:17.345 --> 08:19.048
Um...

08:21.000 --> 08:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:28.099 --> 08:30.547
<i>7-Adam-15,

08:30.635 --> 08:32.168
<i>Seventh Street

08:32.255 --> 08:34.501
- At least it's behind you.
- Behind me?

08:34.780 --> 08:37.494
Please, that letter of reprimand
is a permanent red flag.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.405
It'll affect every promotion
I go in for.

08:39.493 --> 08:40.813
You say tomato.

08:41.222 --> 08:43.126
Uh, you reported
finding a dead body?

08:43.214 --> 08:44.439
Yeah, he's in
the men's room.

08:44.527 --> 08:46.334
Must've come in on
the late bus from Phoenix...

08:46.421 --> 08:47.923
After the cleaning crew
went through.

08:48.011 --> 08:49.811
All right. We'll take it
from here. Thank you.

09:02.837 --> 09:04.356
Definitely a homicide.

09:04.506 --> 09:05.611
Glove up.

09:05.870 --> 09:08.165
Find an I.D.
Don't touch anything else.

09:16.543 --> 09:18.286
Control, run a party.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.744
Last of Valance,
first of Corey.

09:20.832 --> 09:25.163
D.O.B. 4/14/97, and notify a
supervisor and homicide unit.

09:25.251 --> 09:26.455
Copy that.

09:26.543 --> 09:28.463
At least we know what
we're doing until the test.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.017
Yeah.

09:30.158 --> 09:31.580
Waiting.

09:38.798 --> 09:40.248
Sit on the bench.

09:41.652 --> 09:43.361
I thought I told you
to take it easy.

09:43.449 --> 09:44.532
We did.

09:44.620 --> 09:45.798
Officer West
spotted these two

09:45.886 --> 09:46.958
trying to steal an ATM

09:47.045 --> 09:48.251
from the Save Mart
on Cahuenga.

09:48.339 --> 09:49.915
Writing it up as a 211?

09:50.003 --> 09:51.040
No, sir.

09:51.161 --> 09:52.915
Technically, it's considered
a bank burglary,

09:53.002 --> 09:54.075
not a robbery.

09:54.163 --> 09:55.286
Very good.

09:55.374 --> 09:56.997
Sir, can I ask you
something?

09:57.314 --> 09:58.611
Okay.

09:59.255 --> 10:00.634
Why'd you become a cop?

10:01.611 --> 10:02.731
I gave him
a little homework.

10:02.842 --> 10:04.087
Easy day and all.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.197
I liked the teamwork.
I missed it after the Army.

10:09.295 --> 10:11.173
<i>I need those files right now.</i>

10:11.520 --> 10:12.869
Excuse me.

10:15.580 --> 10:16.693
Hey.

10:16.874 --> 10:18.259
Hey.
How's it going?

10:18.347 --> 10:19.822
Better now.

10:20.111 --> 10:22.861
So, listen, I can probably
duck out of here early...

10:22.951 --> 10:25.126
Jackson's got an exam
this afternoon.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.197
Any way you can clear your
schedule for some us time?

10:28.285 --> 10:30.788
Actually,
I think I can.

10:31.267 --> 10:32.372
Really?

10:32.460 --> 10:33.753
Yeah.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.251
Call me
when you're off.

10:38.876 --> 10:40.789
You ever dated a guy
with a kid?

10:40.986 --> 10:42.703
Relax.
This is about Jessica.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.455
I think
I freaked her out today

10:44.595 --> 10:46.267
suggesting she meet Henry.

10:46.384 --> 10:49.267
I doubt it. My guess is nothing
freaks that woman out.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.056
What the hell?

10:52.298 --> 10:55.126
Hey, you stepped in
a bit of a wasp nest.

10:55.244 --> 10:57.624
Did either of you
touch the body?

10:57.711 --> 10:59.754
He did. With gloves on
to get the wallet.

10:59.841 --> 11:01.374
Is that all
that you touched?

11:01.461 --> 11:04.476
Yes. Why?
You're freaking me out.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.564
Wait. That is
an active crime scene.

11:06.665 --> 11:07.874
Well, that's secondary
right now.

11:07.961 --> 11:09.874
Hi. I'm Dr. Morgan
from the CDC.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.414
Are you sure you didn't come
into contact with the victim's

11:11.501 --> 11:13.820
mouth, saliva,
or any bodily fluids?

11:13.908 --> 11:15.031
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:15.119 --> 11:17.204
No sign of infection.
Infection?

11:17.291 --> 11:19.812
Your murder victim is part of
a homegrown terror cell

11:19.900 --> 11:21.374
that the DHS
has been tracking,

11:21.461 --> 11:23.314
and we believe
that they're planning

11:23.402 --> 11:27.447
a deadly biological attack
on the City of Los Angeles.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.173
Okay, so, here is
what we know.

11:34.283 --> 11:36.634
At 10:00 last night, this man...
Corey Valance...

11:36.770 --> 11:38.484
Boarded a bus
from Phoenix to L.A.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.757
He had a partner with him.

11:39.845 --> 11:41.634
We have no identification
on that man,

11:41.744 --> 11:44.476
but we do know that they're part
of a fringe nationalist group

11:44.564 --> 11:46.806
which believes
that Los Angeles stands for

11:46.978 --> 11:48.908
everything that is wrong
in America.

11:49.032 --> 11:51.242
The two men arrived
here at 5:00 this morning.

11:51.330 --> 11:53.609
We believe Corey's partner
strangled him

11:53.697 --> 11:55.296
in the bus station bathroom
right after.

11:55.384 --> 11:56.702
You thinking Corey
got cold feet?

11:56.790 --> 11:58.294
It seems likely, yes,

11:58.381 --> 12:00.524
especially since they came here
with this deadly virus.

12:00.611 --> 12:02.414
Well, that explains the
Silkwood shower we just took.

12:02.501 --> 12:03.689
That was purely
a precaution.

12:03.777 --> 12:05.874
There is no evidence
that the biological agent

12:05.962 --> 12:07.422
they were transporting
has been released.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.915
But we do have
every reason to believe

12:10.051 --> 12:12.406
that there is an attack planned
in the near future.

12:12.494 --> 12:14.212
What type of virus
are we talking about?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.955
A weaponized strain
of hemorrhagic fever...

12:17.043 --> 12:19.336
Basically causes you to
start bleeding and never stop.

12:19.559 --> 12:21.222
And that's how
the virus spreads,

12:21.341 --> 12:23.254
through contact
with bodily fluids.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.979
It has an extremely short
incubation period

12:26.067 --> 12:27.495
and a gruesome pathology.

12:27.583 --> 12:31.018
If not treated quickly,
it has a 90% fatality rate.

12:31.106 --> 12:32.464
And if
it's treated quickly?

12:32.551 --> 12:34.598
We believe that drops down
to around 60%.

12:34.747 --> 12:36.414
But the bad news is...

12:36.501 --> 12:37.526
That's not the bad news?

12:37.614 --> 12:39.044
- No.
- The bad news is,

12:39.131 --> 12:41.294
there's only
an experimental vaccine.

12:41.498 --> 12:42.708
We're flying it here
from Atlanta.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.646
But there's only
a few hundred doses.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.513
Nowhere near enough
to combat an outbreak.

12:46.638 --> 12:50.254
So, obviously, the
rookie exam will be postponed.

12:50.466 --> 12:52.808
The Feds are asking us to be
their boots on the ground

12:52.896 --> 12:54.792
while they set up
a command center here.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.464
First order of business...

12:56.709 --> 12:59.294
To I.D. Corey's
partner/killer.

12:59.381 --> 13:01.457
So you'll conduct
field interviews

13:01.545 --> 13:03.124
with the other passengers
on the bus.

13:03.211 --> 13:05.404
Do we think Corey's killer
is operating alone now?

13:05.529 --> 13:07.404
No. We think
there's one more...

13:07.492 --> 13:09.402
A local who picked him up
at the bus station.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.544
So, okay, this is
extremely sensitive.

13:11.693 --> 13:13.763
We can't risk the news
getting out

13:13.873 --> 13:15.464
and causing a panic.

13:15.693 --> 13:16.914
That being said,

13:17.123 --> 13:18.794
you can warn
your immediate families

13:18.881 --> 13:20.482
to stay away
from populated areas,

13:20.584 --> 13:21.753
but no details.

13:21.841 --> 13:22.914
Understood?

13:23.001 --> 13:24.826
All right.
Let's go get these guys.

13:29.505 --> 13:31.472
Mom, it's only for
you and Dad, okay?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.317
- You can't tell anybody else.
- No, I re... I really

13:33.404 --> 13:34.490
can't
say anything else.

13:34.578 --> 13:36.248
- <i>Now, the majority of...</i>
- You knew.

13:39.461 --> 13:40.874
Can you give us a minute,
please?

13:40.995 --> 13:42.597
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.

13:42.714 --> 13:45.074
That's why you hesitated when
I talked about Henry visiting.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.204
You knew L.A.
wasn't safe.

13:47.519 --> 13:51.199
I was briefed about
a possible threat last week.

13:51.355 --> 13:52.785
And you didn't warn me.

13:53.161 --> 13:55.073
You'd just have Henry show up
for the apocalypse.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.914
No, no. I-I didn't know
that this was real.

13:58.152 --> 14:00.414
The DHS and the FBI
hear dozens

14:00.501 --> 14:02.269
of potential terror threats
every month.

14:02.357 --> 14:04.738
And most of them are just talk
or we can shut them down.

14:04.881 --> 14:07.456
That's not the same
as knowing it's safe.

14:07.711 --> 14:09.754
This is my son
we're talking about.

14:09.841 --> 14:12.532
Even if there was the slightest
chance there was danger,

14:12.620 --> 14:13.540
you should've said
something.

14:13.628 --> 14:14.657
You ready?

14:14.745 --> 14:15.751
Yeah.

14:22.921 --> 14:24.683
Honey, you should go
to your parents'.

14:24.923 --> 14:27.886
Look, you know I can't tell you
what's going on.

14:28.364 --> 14:29.917
But it's bad.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.941
You gonna call Wesley?

14:36.464 --> 14:37.816
I want to.

14:38.222 --> 14:40.205
But I don't know if I can
trust him to keep it quiet.

14:40.292 --> 14:41.414
Really?

14:41.501 --> 14:43.353
Yeah, this is the kind of
civil liberties issue

14:43.441 --> 14:45.084
he gets on
his soapbox about.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.268
Yeah, but how would you feel
if something happens

14:47.355 --> 14:49.144
and you didn't warn him?

14:55.619 --> 14:57.209
Hey, it's me.

14:58.535 --> 15:00.754
I'm afraid I can't get together
this afternoon.

15:00.981 --> 15:02.261
Something came up.

15:04.128 --> 15:05.918
Yeah,
I'm disappointed, too.

15:09.629 --> 15:11.402
Uh, I'll call you later.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.238
I couldn't risk it.

15:21.847 --> 15:23.084
<i>Cut. That's lunch.</i>

15:23.171 --> 15:25.058
<i>Everyone back
in 30 minutes, please.</i>

15:28.191 --> 15:29.792
It's not right.

15:30.144 --> 15:31.337
Keeping everyone
in the dark.

15:31.425 --> 15:32.440
We're supposed to be
protecting them.

15:32.527 --> 15:33.517
That's what
we're trying to do.

15:33.605 --> 15:34.334
Yeah, but...

15:34.421 --> 15:35.794
But nothing,
Officer Nolan.

15:35.881 --> 15:37.628
This is where
the job's hardest.

15:37.791 --> 15:40.544
If we alert the public,
we alert the men we're hunting.

15:40.631 --> 15:42.886
Odds are, they'll panic
and set it all off.

15:43.051 --> 15:45.334
And then we'll cause exactly
what we're trying to prevent.

15:45.421 --> 15:47.604
And what if they set it off
anyway before we catch them?

15:47.691 --> 15:49.167
Then it'll haunt us.

15:50.358 --> 15:51.924
All right,
what's this guy's name?

15:53.421 --> 15:54.824
Really?

15:55.980 --> 15:57.738
Um, Brad Dallas?

15:57.839 --> 15:59.964
Oh, hey.
That's me.

16:00.051 --> 16:01.584
Can we have a word with you
over here?

16:01.671 --> 16:04.519
Uh, sure.
Uh, be right back.

16:06.251 --> 16:08.316
Were you on the bus last night
coming from Phoenix?

16:08.410 --> 16:10.361
Uh, yeah.
I was visiting my mom. Why?

16:10.449 --> 16:11.834
Did you see this man
on the bus?

16:11.921 --> 16:13.004
Oh, that's cool.

16:13.091 --> 16:14.254
Is that a yes?

16:14.894 --> 16:16.414
Uh, yeah,
he looks familiar.

16:16.501 --> 16:18.629
He was traveling with someone.
You happen to remember him?

16:18.716 --> 16:19.999
No, I wasn't
paying attention.

16:20.148 --> 16:21.388
I was taking
a bunch of selfies.

16:21.501 --> 16:23.097
You know,
for the 'gram?

16:23.253 --> 16:24.369
But I couldn't post them,
though,

16:24.456 --> 16:25.345
'cause my pores were huge.

16:25.433 --> 16:26.374
Can we see them,
please?

16:26.461 --> 16:27.468
The pictures,
not your pores.

16:27.555 --> 16:28.844
Oh.

16:33.082 --> 16:35.402
Yep,
that's our dead guy.

16:36.300 --> 16:39.423
Yeah, which means the man
next to him's our target,

16:39.511 --> 16:40.785
but he's too dark
to see.

16:40.878 --> 16:42.432
You know who's really good
at Photoshop?

16:42.519 --> 16:44.164
The FBI.
That's right.

16:44.251 --> 16:45.504
We're gonna take your phone,
but we'll get it back to you

16:45.591 --> 16:46.624
just as soon as we can.

16:46.711 --> 16:48.204
W-- Uh... Um...

16:48.415 --> 16:49.834
Stay dry.

16:51.631 --> 16:53.199
Man.

16:53.501 --> 16:54.704
And here I thought
that test was gonna be

16:54.791 --> 16:56.754
the most stressful thing
about my day.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.414
Best case scenario,
it's tomorrow's problem.

16:58.501 --> 16:59.745
And worst case?

16:59.847 --> 17:01.334
Never mind...
Don't answer that.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.551
Police.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.794
Took you long enough.

17:07.964 --> 17:09.433
Bag's in here.

17:09.586 --> 17:11.839
Sir, we're here about the bus
you took from Phoenix.

17:11.926 --> 17:14.210
No kidding.
I called you about the bag.

17:14.421 --> 17:15.624
And what bag is that?

17:15.711 --> 17:17.384
I thought it was mine
on the bus.

17:17.472 --> 17:19.124
I picked it up
by accident.

17:19.211 --> 17:22.464
Noticed as soon as I got home.
Called right away.

17:22.550 --> 17:25.253
Still took you guys like
six hours to get here.

17:25.363 --> 17:27.002
Uh, sir, we're not here
about a bag.

17:27.090 --> 17:28.501
So you don't have mine?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.834
No.

17:29.921 --> 17:32.044
Damn it.
My computer's in there.

17:32.131 --> 17:33.964
I went through this one
looking for an address,

17:34.051 --> 17:37.339
and all I found was
some weird science equipment.

17:39.751 --> 17:41.704
Control,
this is 7-Adam-19.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.191
Patch me into task force,
please.

17:43.279 --> 17:46.732
Sir, did you...
touch anything in there?

17:46.921 --> 17:49.087
Yeah, I cut my finger
going through it

17:49.175 --> 17:50.664
looking for an address.

17:50.831 --> 17:52.254
Some kind
of broken vial.

17:52.511 --> 17:53.914
Won't stop bleeding.

17:54.001 --> 17:55.084
Everything okay
in there?

17:55.171 --> 17:57.160
Yeah.
Just stay out there.

18:06.450 --> 18:07.780
Tim. No!

18:11.791 --> 18:14.462
What's happening?
It's okay.

18:14.550 --> 18:16.164
There's a bad case of the flu
going around.

18:16.251 --> 18:18.304
We were warned about it
this morning at roll call.

18:18.391 --> 18:19.603
Nothing to panic about.

18:19.742 --> 18:21.115
Then why'd
you lock the door?

18:21.603 --> 18:23.165
Standard protocol.

18:23.551 --> 18:24.923
Look,
was there anyone else

18:25.056 --> 18:27.584
in the house with you
earlier today?

18:27.712 --> 18:29.595
No.
My kid's with my ex.

18:29.683 --> 18:31.241
You got
any cold medicine?

18:31.329 --> 18:32.584
I think so.

18:32.751 --> 18:34.765
Go take it.
I'm coughing up blood.

18:34.853 --> 18:35.903
I'm just telling you
how they advised us

18:35.990 --> 18:37.673
to treat this
if we came across it.

18:38.501 --> 18:39.681
Right now,

18:39.769 --> 18:42.262
my partner is radioing
for an ambulance.

18:42.818 --> 18:44.532
Gonna be here any minute.

18:45.961 --> 18:47.751
Go.

18:50.431 --> 18:51.964
Everything all right
out there, Chen?

18:52.181 --> 18:54.504
Uh, yeah.
The CDC's on their way.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.079
Hey, you need
to come out of there.

18:56.167 --> 18:58.873
That's not gonna happen.
Got to keep this contained.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.414
Tim... It's gonna
be all right, Boot.

19:01.626 --> 19:04.464
You keep your head
in the game, okay?

19:05.438 --> 19:07.150
Everything's
gonna be fine.

19:11.461 --> 19:13.051
Where are
those pictures?

19:15.517 --> 19:17.325
Okay, FBI table.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.841
John, uh, wait.

19:23.881 --> 19:25.442
I'm sorry.

19:26.302 --> 19:28.526
I would have never let you
bring your son

19:28.614 --> 19:30.664
into a dangerous situation.

19:31.427 --> 19:32.895
I promise.

19:33.980 --> 19:35.473
Good.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.286
'Cause I really didn't like
being mad at you.

19:38.921 --> 19:41.334
I didn't really like you
being mad at me, either.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.825
Jessica.

19:49.671 --> 19:52.229
Our terrorist is Jimmy Roskin,
31 years old.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.294
Arrested eight months ago

19:53.382 --> 19:54.754
on a hate crime charge
that didn't stick.

19:54.841 --> 19:56.199
Okay, run his photo
against all the traffic

19:56.286 --> 19:57.652
and security cameras
around the bus station.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.559
And check
for known associates.

19:59.794 --> 20:01.315
Looks like we have
our first infection.

20:01.403 --> 20:02.552
Who?

20:02.640 --> 20:05.450
One of the bus passengers.
Luckily, he's contained.

20:05.921 --> 20:07.551
But Tim might be
infected, too.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.630
Come on.
Let's move it on out.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.543
Officer Chen, you
want to tell me what happened?

20:28.630 --> 20:31.124
Yeah, uh, the bus passenger
mistakenly grabbed

20:31.211 --> 20:32.738
the wrong bag, and the virus
must have been in it

20:32.825 --> 20:34.575
because he coughed up blood
on Tim.

20:34.663 --> 20:36.376
What... Whoa.
What are they doing?

20:36.464 --> 20:37.747
We need to
get them out of there.

20:37.835 --> 20:39.254
We will. But first
we have to establish

20:39.341 --> 20:40.374
a proper quarantine.

20:40.461 --> 20:41.664
Did any blood
get on you?

20:41.751 --> 20:43.874
Uh, no.
I was out here.

20:43.961 --> 20:45.414
Tim immediately
closed the door.

20:45.586 --> 20:46.876
Smart man.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.370
Officer Bradford, this is
Dr. Morgan from the CDC.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.184
Hey, Doc.
How you doing?

20:53.312 --> 20:55.700
Fine. But Mr. Langston's
struggling a little.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.294
Can you describe
his condition?

20:57.381 --> 21:00.458
Yeah. He, uh,
started coughing blood

21:00.551 --> 21:01.964
about 20 minutes ago.

21:02.051 --> 21:03.544
Now he's got
a pretty wicked nosebleed.

21:03.631 --> 21:07.112
Why aren't they coming in?
Where's my ambulance?

21:07.200 --> 21:10.124
It'll be here any minute.
Just... stay put.

21:10.211 --> 21:11.229
Save your energy.

21:11.317 --> 21:13.044
Uh, where's the vaccine?

21:13.131 --> 21:15.382
Still in the air. Should land
in the next hour or so.

21:15.470 --> 21:17.203
You can't
make Tim wait in there.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.690
He might not be infected.
Sorry.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.231
Quarantine rules exist
for a reason.

21:21.461 --> 21:22.588
Officer Bradford,

21:22.676 --> 21:24.556
do you mind if I put you
to work while you wait?

21:25.432 --> 21:26.790
You want to know
what's in the bag?

21:26.877 --> 21:27.875
Yes, I do.

21:27.963 --> 21:29.143
Copy that.

21:29.231 --> 21:32.854
Uh, Chen, I'm gonna
turn on my body cam.

21:32.942 --> 21:34.305
You can monitor it
from out there.

21:34.446 --> 21:36.659
Okay.
Please be careful.

21:40.381 --> 21:41.914
All right.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.502
Here we go.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.153
Wait, wait.
What is that bottle?

22:00.582 --> 22:02.504
Looks like
the delivery device.

22:02.637 --> 22:04.914
It's a misting fan.
I think you're right.

22:05.035 --> 22:07.075
Looks like there's a growth
medium inside the bottle.

22:07.162 --> 22:08.950
Add the virus to it,
then spray it in a crowd.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.530
Droplets land
on people's faces,

22:10.618 --> 22:12.413
infect them through
their mouth and nose.

22:12.501 --> 22:14.414
It's as low tech
as you can get.

22:14.543 --> 22:15.793
It's Dr. Morgan.

22:15.881 --> 22:17.887
I know how they're planning
to disperse the virus.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.801
Understood.

22:19.896 --> 22:21.469
Yes.

22:21.791 --> 22:23.664
Okay, keep...
Keep me posted.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.044
How's Tim?

22:25.131 --> 22:27.223
- It's too soon to tell.
- Got something!

22:29.684 --> 22:32.004
Photo of our guy matched back
to a gas station

22:32.091 --> 22:33.414
where the bus depot is.

22:33.501 --> 22:34.971
We got a picture
of the car

22:35.059 --> 22:36.334
that picked him up
but not the driver.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.584
I ran the plate,
but it came back stolen.

22:37.671 --> 22:39.338
Okay,
cut to the good news.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.683
I followed it
through traffic cameras

22:40.770 --> 22:41.818
all the way
to Highland Park.

22:41.905 --> 22:43.526
But I lost it when it got off
the freeway.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.315
That area's mostly residential,
except for the police museum...

22:46.403 --> 22:47.630
But I doubt that's where
they were headed.

22:47.717 --> 22:49.051
More than likely,
that's where home base is.

22:49.138 --> 22:51.341
Or they went local
to avoid highway cams.

22:51.429 --> 22:52.916
Either way,
it's the only lead we got.

22:53.004 --> 22:53.817
Get out there.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.797
I'm sending all available units
to canvass with you.

22:55.884 --> 22:57.035
Yes, sir.

23:01.661 --> 23:04.449
No sign of any I.D.
or target information.

23:07.365 --> 23:09.035
Tim!
Tim, look out!

23:14.881 --> 23:17.504
Tim?

23:17.591 --> 23:19.914
Tim!

23:20.001 --> 23:22.004
I gotta get outta here.

23:22.091 --> 23:23.710
Gotta get
outta here here.

23:25.131 --> 23:26.380
Gotta get outta here.

23:30.341 --> 23:32.001
Tim!

23:35.881 --> 23:37.624
Tim, are you okay?

23:45.001 --> 23:46.294
Hey, answer me.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.550
It's okay! I'm okay!

23:50.810 --> 23:52.103
Well, that was fun.

23:52.191 --> 23:53.699
Are you sure
you're okay?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.653
Kind of depends on your
definition of the word.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.488
You need to get that vaccine
here right now.

24:02.211 --> 24:04.588
<i>All units, be advised
we have a positive I.D.</i>

24:04.676 --> 24:06.457
<i>on the terror suspect

24:06.545 --> 24:09.301

24:09.388 --> 24:11.029

24:31.795 --> 24:34.130
Well, if you do see him,
or the car, please call 911.

24:34.218 --> 24:35.797
Right.

24:37.341 --> 24:39.164
Nobody knows each other
in this neighborhood.

24:39.251 --> 24:41.051
Back in Pennsylvania,
I knew all my neighbors.

24:41.171 --> 24:43.334
Names, families, even helped
deliver a few kids.

24:43.427 --> 24:44.692
I'm sorry, what?

24:44.780 --> 24:47.783
Robertson twins,
winter storm of 2014.

24:47.918 --> 24:49.503
Hospital roads
were all blocked,

24:49.591 --> 24:51.276
so I had to become
a temporary midwife.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.387
Good thing I brought
my toolbox,

24:52.474 --> 24:54.074
- too, 'cause... right.
- Forget I asked.

24:56.051 --> 24:58.044
Let's go talk to
some real locals.

25:01.341 --> 25:02.504
Well, that was a bust.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.124
Yeah, most people
are at work.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.050
Hey.
What's going on?

25:07.341 --> 25:09.169
Awful lot of cops around.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.164
I'm not really
at liberty to say.

25:11.251 --> 25:13.393
Seriously?
This is my neighborhood.

25:13.481 --> 25:15.520
If something's going on,
I deserve to know.

25:17.051 --> 25:18.606
Okay. But.

25:19.872 --> 25:22.075
You have to keep it quiet.
You can't tell anyone else.

25:22.163 --> 25:23.372
Sure.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.059
We're trying to stop
a terror attack.

25:25.147 --> 25:26.943
We believe one of the terrorists
lives around here.

25:27.030 --> 25:29.004
So you should evacuate...
Maybe even get out of the city.

25:29.091 --> 25:31.099
Okay?
No, not okay.

25:31.223 --> 25:32.888
So far from okay.

25:32.976 --> 25:35.165
Why haven't you issued a warning
or an evacuation?

25:35.253 --> 25:37.254
- People have the right to know.
- We can't, okay?

25:37.341 --> 25:39.124
'Cause it would cause a panic
and alert the terrorists

25:39.211 --> 25:40.918
- that we're onto them.
- That's not your call to make.

25:41.005 --> 25:42.316
This is why I didn't tell you
in the first place.

25:42.403 --> 25:43.816
Because I knew you were gonna
get on your high horse...

25:43.903 --> 25:47.414
High horse? This is about
basic civil liberties, guys.

25:47.645 --> 25:48.794
Give me your phone.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.130
What?

25:50.475 --> 25:51.873
I'm placing you
under arrest.

25:51.961 --> 25:53.114
Wait. What for?

25:53.341 --> 25:56.005
Violation of public order.
Come on.

25:56.247 --> 25:57.527
This isn't gonna hold up in court.

25:57.614 --> 25:58.964
Doesn't have to.

25:59.051 --> 26:01.366
But you're incommunicado
until this is resolved.

26:01.454 --> 26:02.787
Come on.

26:06.171 --> 26:07.317
You sure about this?

26:07.405 --> 26:08.695
No.

26:11.163 --> 26:12.456
Do you recognize
this man?

26:12.677 --> 26:14.021
Or this car?

26:14.389 --> 26:15.543
Yeah, the car, yeah.

26:15.631 --> 26:17.124
I see it almost
every morning on Fig.

26:17.211 --> 26:18.693
That's where I panhandle.

26:18.849 --> 26:21.762
The, uh, driver is
a real piece of crap.

26:21.912 --> 26:24.115
Cursed me out,
saying I ruined his country.

26:24.467 --> 26:26.664
Like I wasn't born
at Cedars-Sinai, you know?

26:26.787 --> 26:28.504
Officer Bishop.

26:28.725 --> 26:29.810
Thank you.

26:29.983 --> 26:31.202
This gentleman
has seen the car.

26:31.289 --> 26:32.464
I don't suppose you know
where the guy lives?

26:32.551 --> 26:33.874
Over off Wayland.

26:33.961 --> 26:35.504
Yeah, I, uh,
keyed his car once

26:35.591 --> 26:37.464
while I was out collecting cans
on trash day.

26:37.551 --> 26:39.858
It's a yellow
apartment building.

26:40.008 --> 26:41.186
Can't miss it.

26:47.001 --> 26:48.754
You sure we shouldn't wait
for a Hazmat team?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.624
There's no time. They might
already be on the way

26:50.711 --> 26:51.754
to their target.

26:56.051 --> 26:57.051
Clear!

26:58.791 --> 27:01.704
Our unknown terrorist
is Brendan Mitchell.

27:01.841 --> 27:03.197
Control,
alert task force.

27:03.285 --> 27:05.328
We have a positive I.D.
on our second suspect.

27:06.243 --> 27:08.658
Help!

27:08.879 --> 27:10.556
Help!

27:37.517 --> 27:38.914
Bishop?

27:39.259 --> 27:40.853
We know where
they're headed.

27:46.110 --> 27:48.961
Feds are pulling resources
from all over the Southland.

27:49.148 --> 27:52.043
<i>All major roads heading to LAX
are being monitored.</i>

27:52.131 --> 27:54.004
<i>So while the airport
is shut down,</i>

27:54.091 --> 27:56.710
<i>we'll provide support
at assigned checkpoints</i>

27:56.798 --> 27:59.334
<i>on Century
and Sepulveda Boulevards.</i>

27:59.681 --> 28:01.460
7-Adam-07, copy.

28:01.548 --> 28:03.254
En route
to Sepulveda checkpoint.

28:03.341 --> 28:05.294
You're seriously gonna keep me
in this car all night?

28:05.381 --> 28:08.084
You're the one that wanted to
spend more quality time together.

28:08.171 --> 28:10.754
Sir, this operation's
moving at a million miles an hour.

28:10.841 --> 28:12.414
And these checkpoints were
determined by someone

28:12.501 --> 28:14.050
who has definitely
not tried to make

28:14.138 --> 28:15.693
a last-minute flight
at LAX.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.294
We're not running point
on this.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.214
<i>We all have orders
to follow.</i>

28:19.302 --> 28:20.294
Including me.

28:20.381 --> 28:22.824
Yes, sir. But there is
a hole in the perimeter

28:22.912 --> 28:24.374
that only an L.A. native

28:24.461 --> 28:27.292
or a rookie patrol officer
who's painstakingly studied

28:27.380 --> 28:28.943
every street in this city
would know.

28:29.031 --> 28:31.003
He's right. There are
back roads off La Cienega.

28:31.091 --> 28:32.074
Our guy would know that.

28:32.162 --> 28:34.396
Sir, even with the airport
shut down,

28:34.498 --> 28:36.307
there'll be thousands
of people waiting there.

28:36.395 --> 28:37.912
If these two guys
get through...

28:39.591 --> 28:41.107
All right, let's do it.

28:41.195 --> 28:43.398
Control, this is 7-L-20.

28:43.501 --> 28:45.670
<i>Show us diverting
to La Cienega,</i>

28:45.921 --> 28:47.794
<i>and reroute an airship
over there.</i>

28:48.006 --> 28:50.013
Eyes out
for our blue sedan.

28:57.291 --> 29:00.216
Hey, I, uh... I just checked
with Dr. Morgan.

29:00.326 --> 29:02.164
The vaccine's
minutes away.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.914
You know, you're good at
a lot of things...

29:05.170 --> 29:07.464
Lying isn't one of them.

29:08.045 --> 29:11.568
You think I'm good at things?
Can I get that in writing?

29:13.951 --> 29:15.724
How are you doing?

29:16.045 --> 29:17.974
Are there
any symptoms yet?

29:20.551 --> 29:22.414
I'm sweating like a pig.

29:22.501 --> 29:24.699
But it's probably because

29:24.787 --> 29:26.615
it's 100 degrees
in this room.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.504
It's gonna be okay.

29:31.826 --> 29:33.365
I really believe that.

29:36.211 --> 29:38.115
I'm sure you do.

29:40.521 --> 29:41.914
But if it isn't...

29:42.076 --> 29:44.480
Don't think like that.
It's...

29:44.568 --> 29:47.792
If it isn't...
I'm not going out

29:47.880 --> 29:50.170
the way my man Pete here
just did.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.709
What are you saying?

29:54.211 --> 29:55.841
When the time comes...

29:58.341 --> 30:00.240
...I'm going out
on my own terms.

30:11.091 --> 30:14.058
Be advised. Suspect
vehicle spotted on Centinela,

30:14.146 --> 30:15.414
heading south
onto La Cienega.

30:15.501 --> 30:16.545

9, Foxtrot, 7.

30:20.248 --> 30:23.154
Up ahead. Blue sedan.
That's him.

30:26.709 --> 30:29.755
Control, 7-Adam-15...
We are in pursuit of suspect.

32:08.008 --> 32:10.855
Jimmy!
Jimmy, run! Run!

32:13.421 --> 32:14.707
They're running!

32:18.751 --> 32:20.519
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

32:29.628 --> 32:31.464
Control, 7-L-20.

32:31.636 --> 32:33.124
Suspects are on foot
heading east.

32:33.211 --> 32:34.914
We need a five-block perimeter
set up.

32:35.001 --> 32:36.544
And send Hazmat units

32:36.632 --> 32:38.842
to lock down this area
for containment.

32:40.211 --> 32:41.527
This way!

32:49.421 --> 32:50.584
- Nobody move!
- Hey, hey, hey!

32:50.671 --> 32:52.380
Everybody down! Get down!

33:04.841 --> 33:06.341
He's on the bus
with the virus!

33:07.795 --> 33:09.128
Angela,
it's too dangerous.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.009
We have to.

33:14.567 --> 33:15.947
Ready?

33:20.575 --> 33:23.000
Everybody down!

33:24.421 --> 33:25.504
All I need is a shot.

33:25.591 --> 33:27.374
I'll get you that.

33:27.613 --> 33:29.124
Down!

33:29.328 --> 33:30.368
Nobody move.

33:35.711 --> 33:37.464
Get outta here.
Go, go.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.914
Dude,
let's talk about this.

33:45.001 --> 33:47.164
Hey! Hey!
Don't do that.

33:47.251 --> 33:48.874
You don't
need to do that.

33:48.961 --> 33:52.164
Let me go, or I'm gonna infect
everybody on this bus!

33:52.251 --> 33:54.593
If I let you go, you'll infect
a hell of a lot more people.

33:54.773 --> 33:57.685
Yeah. None of them
are gonna be you!

33:57.773 --> 33:59.004
Damn.

33:59.091 --> 34:00.964
That's some straight shooting
right there.

34:01.051 --> 34:03.414
Appealing to my sense
of self-preservation.

34:04.191 --> 34:06.542
But here's the thing...

34:06.680 --> 34:09.355
I made my peace with dying
when I got on this bus.

34:11.130 --> 34:12.706
So I'm coming over there...

34:14.251 --> 34:15.591
...and I'm arresting you.

34:18.341 --> 34:20.090
Aah!

34:25.551 --> 34:27.670
Clear! Go, go! Off now! Off the bus!
Go, go, go, go!

34:33.091 --> 34:34.504
Did you shoot me?

34:34.746 --> 34:37.204
Just a little.

34:37.291 --> 34:38.824
I guess you're screwed.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.543
Rules clearly say that
if you shoot your rookie,

34:41.841 --> 34:44.199
then you can't hand him off
to another T.O.

34:44.920 --> 34:49.254
7-Adam-07, show Code 4
at our location... suspect down.

34:54.152 --> 34:56.911
Heading east on Crescent in
search of armed terror suspect.

34:58.671 --> 35:00.926
Ma'am,
get back inside.

35:11.420 --> 35:14.028
<i>7-Adam-15,
crossing Wilton on Higsby.</i>

35:14.171 --> 35:15.364
No sign of suspect.

35:26.105 --> 35:28.333
Control,
possible contact,

35:28.598 --> 35:30.411
5824 Elgin.

35:30.631 --> 35:32.215
We're gonna check
the backyard.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.051
Yeah,
this is Jessica Russo.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.701
Call the FAA and tell them that
we're gonna fly some choppers

36:03.788 --> 36:06.979
into LAX airspace and then
have them reroute an airship

36:07.067 --> 36:08.958
to our location ASAP.

36:33.473 --> 36:34.506
Think we got him?

36:34.594 --> 36:36.473
Assume we didn't.

36:38.051 --> 36:39.754
Hey, there.

36:40.012 --> 36:41.414
You hear those sirens?

36:41.501 --> 36:42.834
That's just about
a couple hundred

36:42.921 --> 36:44.604
of my closest friends
coming to back me up.

36:44.692 --> 36:46.651
But you're all alone.

36:48.881 --> 36:50.124
Okay.

36:50.211 --> 36:51.834
Your turn.

36:52.286 --> 36:53.629
Hey, Jimmy!

36:53.717 --> 36:55.848
We got your buddy
in custody.

36:56.207 --> 36:57.207
It's over.

36:58.872 --> 37:00.833
I know you're hurt.

37:01.176 --> 37:02.848
But you're still alive.

37:03.413 --> 37:06.246
And I'm offering a way
for you to stay alive.

37:06.973 --> 37:09.559
Think of all the publicity
you'll get.

37:09.676 --> 37:12.254
You'll be the face
of your cause.

37:12.426 --> 37:14.434
So much better
than being a martyr

37:14.522 --> 37:16.419
in a cold box
underground.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.093
But, Jimmy,
you got to decide right now.

37:22.426 --> 37:24.786
When S.W.A.T. gets here,
they're just gonna light you up.

37:26.251 --> 37:30.164
Okay. Okay.
I-I-I'm coming out.

37:30.251 --> 37:31.841
Don't shoot.

37:35.171 --> 37:36.504
Show me those hands.

37:38.926 --> 37:39.893
What the hell?

37:39.981 --> 37:41.254
He was reaching.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.837
I didn't see that.

37:44.921 --> 37:46.294
Stay back.

37:46.496 --> 37:47.879
He might still be alive.

37:47.967 --> 37:50.668
He might be infected. So we
don't go anywhere near him.

37:52.778 --> 37:54.176
Suspect is down.

37:54.264 --> 37:56.677
I repeat,
suspect is down.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.543
Yeah, area's quarantined
until CDC clears it.

38:05.881 --> 38:07.309
Please tell me
that's the vaccine.

38:07.461 --> 38:08.879
It is.

38:09.184 --> 38:10.533
Wait. Stand back.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.496
You're not wearing
protective gear.

38:13.137 --> 38:14.291
Yeah.

38:15.379 --> 38:18.082
Officer Bradford,
it's time to let me in.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.114
Hey.
Hey, Doc.

38:21.202 --> 38:22.202
We got it.

38:23.591 --> 38:24.964
How are you feeling?

38:25.051 --> 38:27.221
Not bad...
All things considered.

38:27.309 --> 38:28.964
Good.
You're right at the edge

38:29.051 --> 38:30.624
of what we think is
the incubation window.

38:30.711 --> 38:34.254
So the fact that you're not
showing any symptoms doesn't suck.

38:34.731 --> 38:36.816
But we're gonna give you
this vaccine just to make sure.

38:36.903 --> 38:38.637
It's experimental,
right?

38:38.739 --> 38:40.414
That's correct.

38:40.501 --> 38:43.119
So we're just gonna have
to wait and see what happens.

38:43.207 --> 38:44.414
Maybe nothing.

38:44.692 --> 38:46.395
Maybe you grow horns.

38:46.711 --> 38:48.374
But for now,

38:49.059 --> 38:50.841
I'd say you might've
dodged a bullet.

38:56.004 --> 38:57.791
Any chance we can kiss
and make up?

38:57.879 --> 38:59.294
Or can I expect
a lawsuit?

38:59.381 --> 39:01.356
Oh, up
until about 20 minutes ago,

39:01.444 --> 39:03.016
I was drafting it
in my head.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.651
But then you risked everything,
got on that bus,

39:05.739 --> 39:06.704
and saved those people.

39:06.791 --> 39:08.213
You got a little
turned on.

39:08.301 --> 39:09.414
No.

39:09.501 --> 39:12.504
Okay, yeah,
maybe a little.

39:12.591 --> 39:15.834
It made me realize that I was
a little shortsighted earlier.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.964
Maybe I didn't
actually know best

39:18.051 --> 39:20.051
what should happen
in that situation.

39:20.364 --> 39:21.874
So, we're good again?

39:22.754 --> 39:24.223
Again.

39:24.421 --> 39:26.356
Does it seem like
we fight a lot?

39:26.444 --> 39:28.227
Definitely. But...

39:28.699 --> 39:29.988
I think it's our thing,
you know?

39:30.076 --> 39:33.409
Like some couples swing dance
or go to Disneyland.

39:34.043 --> 39:36.278
And I didn't want to r...

39:36.381 --> 39:37.847
Jackson!

39:38.081 --> 39:39.456
Dad.

39:40.058 --> 39:41.414
Heard what you did.

39:41.501 --> 39:42.761
What can I say?

39:42.849 --> 39:45.285
I'm my father's son.

39:57.501 --> 39:59.706
- Good job.
- What?

40:00.122 --> 40:03.075
Oh, um, thank you.
It was all Jessica.

40:03.205 --> 40:06.293
Don't sell yourself short.
You sure you're okay?

40:07.182 --> 40:08.240
No.

40:10.974 --> 40:13.285
I don't think he was reaching
for a weapon.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.767
What are you saying?

40:14.855 --> 40:16.704
I'm saying
she lied to me.

40:16.941 --> 40:18.834
The guy had
a biological weapon.

40:18.921 --> 40:20.603
He was giving up.
Maybe he was,

40:20.691 --> 40:22.174
or maybe that's what
he wanted you to think.

40:22.261 --> 40:23.829
Either way,
his very existence

40:23.917 --> 40:25.584
made him a clear
and present danger.

40:25.785 --> 40:27.204
She's got 20 years
on the job,

40:27.324 --> 40:29.129
dealing with a whole different
level of bad guy...

40:29.216 --> 40:31.269
And I don't know anything
because I'm a rookie?

40:31.711 --> 40:33.704
Look, I'm no Boy Scout,
all right?

40:33.792 --> 40:35.604
If six months on this job
has taught me anything,

40:35.691 --> 40:37.400
it's that there is evil
in this world.

40:37.488 --> 40:39.584
But in that moment,

40:39.855 --> 40:41.189
she chose to lie to me.

40:41.277 --> 40:42.874
Just like she lied to me
about Henry.

40:43.026 --> 40:45.464
So either
she doesn't trust me.

40:46.198 --> 40:47.667
Or she's a liar.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.964
Or she was doing you
a favor.

40:50.104 --> 40:53.213
Giving you deniability if the
shooting ever became a thing.

40:55.131 --> 40:57.118
So you're saying
I should just let it go?

40:57.206 --> 40:59.010
I'm saying it's been
a crazy day.

40:59.098 --> 41:01.351
And you don't know whether
you're coming or going.

41:01.591 --> 41:03.282
So before you risk
your relationship...

41:03.370 --> 41:04.874
And possibly
your career...

41:04.961 --> 41:07.120
By blindly
charging forward,

41:07.671 --> 41:09.671
maybe you should
sleep on it.

41:34.591 --> 41:37.344
Hey. I heard you guys
saved the day.

41:37.432 --> 41:39.479
It was a group effort.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.833
- Glad you're okay.
- Me too.

41:41.921 --> 41:43.821
I-I mean
that you're okay, too.

41:43.909 --> 41:45.094
How's Tim?

41:45.182 --> 41:46.461
I think he's gonna be
all right.

41:46.549 --> 41:49.071
- That's good news.
- What now?

41:49.159 --> 41:51.643
24-hour observation
at the CDC.

41:52.924 --> 41:54.891
I'll bet my pension
he just told doctors

41:54.979 --> 41:57.284
Tim Bradford does not ride
in a wheelchair.

41:57.419 --> 42:00.104
Only way I'm leavin'
out of here is on my own two feet.

42:00.557 --> 42:02.504
Don't you guys have
paperwork to finish?

42:03.455 --> 42:04.792
He's back.

42:05.114 --> 42:07.042
<i>- Yeah, he is.
- So stubborn.</i>

42:07.130 --> 42:09.784
