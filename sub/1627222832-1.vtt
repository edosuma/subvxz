00:12.480 --> 00:15.216
(dramatic music)

00:23.724 --> 00:28.729
(thunder crashing)
(broom sweeping)

01:34.595 --> 01:37.265
(keys jangling)

01:44.271 --> 01:47.475
(door handle clicking)

02:05.459 --> 02:08.127
(door thudding)

02:10.964 --> 02:13.901
(exhaling rapidly)

02:23.311 --> 02:26.247
(heavy rock music)

02:30.117 --> 02:33.120
(breathing heavily)

02:45.833 --> 02:48.602
(dramatic music)

02:56.176 --> 02:58.846
(horse neighing)

03:06.153 --> 03:11.158
(breathing heavily)
(heavy rock music)

03:22.570 --> 03:25.406
(toilet flushing)

03:43.391 --> 03:46.059
(water running)

04:25.299 --> 04:28.135
(machine beeping)

04:31.038 --> 04:33.874
(machine beeping)

04:34.975 --> 04:37.311
(machine beeping rapidly)

04:37.311 --> 04:38.912
- Piece of shit.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.882
(thunder crashing)

04:45.753 --> 04:48.288
(door buzzing)

05:18.652 --> 05:21.489
- Expecting company, Rollins?

05:21.489 --> 05:23.691
That's your little lady friend
coming over for the night?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.258
Huh?

05:25.258 --> 05:26.460
- Zip it, Jelly.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.961
I ain't in the mood
for your shit tonight.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.864
- [Jelly] Well whoever they
are, I hope they brought snacks.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.701
I'm hungry as a
motherfucker, man.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.106
- Deputy Rollins?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.007
- And you are?

05:40.007 --> 05:40.874
- Soaking wet.

05:40.941 --> 05:41.775
Freezing.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.945
Mind if I come in?

05:44.978 --> 05:45.813
- Yeah.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.115
Thanks.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.185
- Henderson County?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.187
- Unfortunately.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.825
It's a little drafty in
here, don't you think?

05:57.825 --> 05:59.827
Sorry, I'm Deputy Adams.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.463
Don't mean to drop
in on you like this,

06:02.463 --> 06:06.133
but in the current state I
didn't have much of a choice.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.201
- You drove all the way
out here in this storm?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.703
- Yeah.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.004
It was coming down in sheets
when I got off the bridge.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.542
I could hardly see three
feet in front of me.

06:14.542 --> 06:18.479
The roads are about to
flood, so I had to pull over.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.513
- Where are you headed?

06:19.547 --> 06:20.380
- Huntington.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.049
Transporting a suspect.

06:22.049 --> 06:22.883
- Huntington.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.384
- Uh-huh.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.353
- That's five hours from here.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.655
- [Adams] Yep.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.589
Like I said, the roads
are starting to flood.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.090
Got the suspect.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.861
I figured what better place
to hole up than a county jail.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.930
- For the night?
- Is that a problem?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.101
- No, no.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.737
I'll call the sheriff
and square it all away.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.506
- Be my guest.

06:45.539 --> 06:50.210
Good luck getting through
to anyone in this, though.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.712
Look, I'm not trying
to cause any issues.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.780
Just let me lock up my guy.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.881
As soon as this storm clears,

06:53.914 --> 06:56.584
I'll get out of your hair, yeah?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.188
- What kind of offender?

07:01.221 --> 07:03.557
- The violent kind.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.391
- And?

07:05.593 --> 07:06.426
- Murder.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.363
Where's all your people?

07:10.363 --> 07:12.232
- It's just me on the weekends.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.100
I'm new.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.070
Just transferred from records.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.640
So being the last man
on the totem pole,

07:19.640 --> 07:21.809
it's just me and
Jelly for the weekend.

07:21.809 --> 07:22.976
- Who's Jelly?

07:30.718 --> 07:35.055
- God damn, Rollins, you
lucky son-of-a-gun, you.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.090
Henderson County, huh?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.092
I need to spend more
time down there.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.162
- [Rollins] That's
enough, Jelly.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.231
- Is Jelly his real name?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.433
- No.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.635
- Why do you call him that?

07:47.635 --> 07:51.238
- [Jelly] Come on in
here and I'll show you.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.273
- He's in for indecent exposure.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.108
The sheriff wanted to get him
in front of a judge today,

07:55.108 --> 07:58.111
but the storm took
care of all that.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.949
So he's with us for the weekend.

08:01.982 --> 08:02.816
- Lucky you.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.084
- Yeah.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.687
He likes to wiggle
his, uh, you know-

08:07.588 --> 08:08.455
- Yeah.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.658
- Yeah.
- I got that.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.861
So my guy, you got another
cell block I can use?

08:13.861 --> 08:15.328
- What's wrong with this one?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.930
- [Jelly] Yeah, what's
wrong with this-

08:16.964 --> 08:18.866
- Shut up.
- All right.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.971
- My guy don't play
well with others.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.873
- Well we've got the women's
block but there's issues

08:25.873 --> 08:27.007
with the locks.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.008
We'll put him in Block B.

08:28.008 --> 08:28.942
How's that?

08:30.678 --> 08:33.780
- As long as nobody
fucks with him.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.284
- I don't think it
will be a problem.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.150
- All right.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.653
I'll bring him in.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.373
(thunder rumbling)

09:01.909 --> 09:05.512
- [Rollins] What the hell did
you say this guy is in for?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.379
- Murder.

09:07.748 --> 09:08.749
- What kind?

09:09.817 --> 09:11.852
- The triple kind.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.720
Twice.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.063
- What the hell is this?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.898
- That's his property.

09:26.533 --> 09:31.104
- Well, I can lock it in the
cage for you, if you want.

09:32.539 --> 09:36.043
- Do you have anything
to eat around here?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.698
- Don't get your hopes up.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.700
(thunder crashing)

09:59.700 --> 10:02.369
The damn thing just eats change.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.638
- Let me try.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.609
- This is the last of it.

10:18.151 --> 10:22.155
(machine beeping)
(machine whirring)

10:22.222 --> 10:23.724
- You were saying?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.627
- How the hell did you do that?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.763
- A woman's touch.

10:29.797 --> 10:34.467
Do you have anywhere where I
can rest my eyes for a bit?

10:35.903 --> 10:36.837
- Smart ass.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.452
- Psst.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.286
Hey, man.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.656
What did they get you for?

10:58.158 --> 11:01.294
You know me, they got me for
rocking out with my cock out.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.363
You know what I mean, huh?

11:05.866 --> 11:06.700
Guess not.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.006
How about that fine-ass lady
cop you came in here with, huh?

11:13.006 --> 11:13.841
Man.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.678
Rollins is a lucky dog,
I'll tell you that.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.148
Spend the night with here, whew.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.651
Did you try anything
freaky with her?

11:24.651 --> 11:25.485
Anything?

11:26.954 --> 11:27.988
Nothing?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.656
Not even during the patdown?

11:29.656 --> 11:32.860
Dude, that's like
the best opportunity.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.129
I guess not.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.701
Hey you know, that reminds me

11:41.701 --> 11:44.838
of a friend I had over
in Granbury one time.

11:44.872 --> 11:45.973
So get this.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.407
He gets pulled over, right.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.243
Apparently he fucks his
way out of the ticket.

11:50.310 --> 11:54.748
I mean, if that's true, that
shit is pretty epic, huh?

11:56.383 --> 12:00.754
Well, he was known
to over-exaggerate
things a little bit,

12:00.821 --> 12:01.554
so,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.560
you don't talk much, do you?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.063
I get that.

12:10.063 --> 12:10.931
Yeah.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.565
Neither does Rollins.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.435
I swear the guy's got
a stick up his ass.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.703
(sighing)

12:16.736 --> 12:18.405
Well either way I hope
you ate before you came

12:18.405 --> 12:21.842
because apparently
the kitchen is closed.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.912
Yeah, the cook went
home or some shit.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.248
Everybody is freaked
out over the storm.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.784
Man, I tell you what,

12:30.784 --> 12:33.386
I'm so fucking hungry
I could eat my watch.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.123
But that would be
time consuming.

12:38.892 --> 12:39.726
Nothing?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.896
Damn, man.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.099
You got that wrapped up tight.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.301
(sighing)

12:48.301 --> 12:51.204
Just talking to
myself here, Jelly.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.106
All alone.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.079
Hey, man, you got any toilet
paper in there with you?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.949
You know, the stuff that they
give you when you book in?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.483
It's paper thin.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.152
I mean mid-swipe your
finger breaks through,

13:05.152 --> 13:07.087
goes right up your ass.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.289
You know.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.590
Nothing?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.325
Not even a handkerchief?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.160
Tissue?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.329
It's kind of an emergency.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.565
Extra pillowcase?

13:18.598 --> 13:19.432
Come on, man.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.800
Help me out here.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.304
Oh shit.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.745
(thunder crashing)

13:36.783 --> 13:38.952
- [Adams] Well it
ain't the Ritz.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.954
- Well like I said,
everybody went home,

13:40.954 --> 13:43.123
so we should be alone.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.824
Welcome to paradise.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.794
- [Adams] What's with
all the empty offices?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.429
- Layoffs.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.830
The county is moving
all those departments

13:50.830 --> 13:52.866
by the end of the month.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.167
- Shit.
- Yeah.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.805
- Well this works.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.175
I just need to get a
couple of hours of shuteye.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.278
Wake me if anything happens.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.980
- What would happen?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.017
- On second thought,
maybe I should-

14:10.017 --> 14:10.951
- [Rollins] No, I
got it, I got it.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.520
It's my cell, my responsibility.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.455
- Well he's my suspect.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.727
- So tell me about him.

14:28.168 --> 14:32.205
- You could write a fucking
movie about that guy.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.341
Kids.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.842
A woman in her 70s.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.345
It makes no difference to him.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.715
When I found him,
he was sleeping a
dumpster, with nothing

14:42.749 --> 14:45.152
on him but a knife and these.

14:47.921 --> 14:48.922
- Risperdal.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.160
- The same shit they give
psychopaths and serial killers

14:53.193 --> 14:55.395
when they're trying to calm
them down for questioning.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.064
- I know what it is.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.701
I cleaned out the
infirmary last spring.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.403
He killed six people?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.207
- Yeah.

15:07.207 --> 15:11.111
A bus driver, a family
of three and two others.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.118
When we pulled him
out of the dumpster,

15:18.118 --> 15:22.122
brought him in for questioning,
he confessed, to all of it.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.191
- Just like that?
- Yep.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.029
That's strange, right?

15:29.029 --> 15:29.862
- Yeah.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.934
- I was bringing him to
Huntington for his psych eval,

15:34.934 --> 15:38.972
and that's when El Nino
happened, so here we are.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.408
- Is he a rancher?

15:45.112 --> 15:46.646
- I doubt it.

15:46.646 --> 15:51.584
No ranchers I know have that
much time for killing sprees.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.786
Like I said, he don't
play well with others,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.422
so, I don't mind staying up.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.489
- No, I got it.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.225
I'll take care of it.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.628
I can handle it.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.563
Jelly and I will
hold down the fort.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.431
- Jelly?

16:05.398 --> 16:06.233
- Yeah.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.236
He's a good guy.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.570
He just has an unhealthy
obsession with his pecker,

16:10.570 --> 16:11.438
that's all.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.640
- Okay.

16:15.075 --> 16:15.842
- [Rollins] Hey, do you have
any paperwork I can file

16:15.842 --> 16:17.510
for all this shit?

16:17.510 --> 16:20.747
- I ain't going out in this
storm to get you damn paperwork.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.515
Besides I'll be out of you
hair before you have time

16:22.515 --> 16:24.117
to file it.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.985
- Fair enough.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.320
- [Adams] Hey, the infirmary?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.522
They got any meds in there?

16:30.757 --> 16:32.292
- Just aspirin and
mild sedatives.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.160
Why?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.963
- [Adams] I feel
a cold coming on.

16:36.963 --> 16:40.700
- I'll see if I can get
you some dry clothes.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.514
(Rollins whistling)

16:59.352 --> 17:00.220
- No way.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.221
You got it to work?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.355
- Magic touch.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.527
- What do you want for it?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.528
- You gonna keep your
dick in your pants

17:08.560 --> 17:10.230
while we got guests?

17:13.532 --> 17:14.467
- Fuck it.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.202
Yeah, whatever you say, man.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.403
Come on.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.238
- Okay.
- I love you, Rollins.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.472
- Yeah, I bet you do.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.473
Don't say I didn't
do nothing for you.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.009
- Love you.
- Yeah.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.385
Did you really kill
all those people?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.887
(tense music)

17:35.822 --> 17:37.157
Hey!

17:37.190 --> 17:38.758
I'm talking to you.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.165
(thunder crashing)

17:48.735 --> 17:50.237
Silence is golden.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.901
(upbeat country music)

18:49.629 --> 18:51.898
- [Jelly] Hey, Rollins.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.266
- What?

18:53.266 --> 18:56.569
- [Jelly] I've got
to drop a deuce, man.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.770
- Tough shit.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.307
- [Jelly] I mean,
it's a real code brown

19:00.307 --> 19:01.741
over here, you know?

19:01.774 --> 19:05.278
It's a big thumper dumper
four emergency, bro.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.349
Hurry every chance you get.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.120
- What the hell is it?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.355
- Can you hurry me
out, I've got to shit.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.156
I've got to shit real bad.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.659
- What's wrong with the
toilet in your cell?

19:19.692 --> 19:20.660
- Oh nothing.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.494
It's lovely.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.795
Fine facilities.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.097
There's just no toilet paper.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.834
What am I supposed to
wipe my ass with, huh?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.035
- Sit tight.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.670
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.606
(thunder rumbling)

19:40.280 --> 19:41.113
Hey!

19:42.349 --> 19:43.683
Hey!

19:43.716 --> 19:45.051
Get up!

19:45.051 --> 19:45.885
Up!

19:47.019 --> 19:47.854
Up!

19:49.055 --> 19:49.889
Get up!

19:49.889 --> 19:50.723
Hands against the wall!

19:50.790 --> 19:52.659
Hands against the wall!

19:55.628 --> 19:56.863
Don't move.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.164
Stay there.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.031
Stay right there.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.000
Jesus fucking Christ.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.834
Oh my God.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.471
Get your fucking head
up against the wall.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.372
Right there.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.639
Don't you fucking move.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.507
- Hey.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.408
Hey, Rollins.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.710
Rollins, what's going on?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.978
- [Rollins] Don't move!

20:12.011 --> 20:12.912
- [Jelly] You've got
to talk to me, man.

20:12.912 --> 20:13.580
- [Rollins] Stay right there.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.014
Don't move!

20:15.047 --> 20:15.848
- [Jelly] Getting a
little worried over here.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.649
- You stay right there.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.851
You stay right there!

20:18.885 --> 20:21.388
(tense music)

20:27.927 --> 20:29.028
- Hey, where are you going?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.363
Where are you going, Rollins?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.999
Rollins, don't leave me
in here with this guy.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.833
Rollins.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.211
(thunder crashing)

21:00.427 --> 21:02.795
(tense music)

21:05.565 --> 21:06.766
- What happened?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.600
- What happened?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.868
Where have you been?

21:08.901 --> 21:10.470
- Where the hell is the
bathroom in this place?

21:10.470 --> 21:11.438
- The bathroom?

21:11.438 --> 21:12.372
Come with me.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.441
You need to see something.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.478
- Ohhhh.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.987
- How long has he
been like that?

21:29.088 --> 21:30.990
- 10, maybe 15 minutes.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.296
Singing that damn song
the whole time, too.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.130
Hey!

21:39.666 --> 21:41.568
Hey, shut up with that.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.837
- What about the arm?

21:44.837 --> 21:48.074
- I told you, he's
putting holes in it.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.244
Didn't you search him when
you took him into custody?

21:52.244 --> 21:53.480
Huh?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.247
Is that how they do it
in Henderson County?

21:55.281 --> 21:57.283
What the fuck is it
with both of you all?

21:57.283 --> 21:58.785
I talk to him; he doesn't
say a god-damned thing.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.320
I talk to you, you don't
say a fucking thing either.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.990
I want to hear
some answers, now.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.160
- Just not here.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.000
- Whoaaa.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.677
(thunder crashing)

22:50.537 --> 22:52.038
- Shit, shit, shit.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.843
I didn't think the smokes
where that big of a deal,

22:56.876 --> 22:59.145
given the gravity
of the situation.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.079
- Situation?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.084
- The luck it took to
bring that motherfucker

23:05.084 --> 23:07.754
in after three years on the run.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.427
Two of my guys lost their
lives to that motherfucker.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.163
I was sparing you
the details earlier,

23:17.163 --> 23:21.000
but those other two that
he killed, they were cops.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.336
- Jesus.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.573
- I wasn't going to let
anyone bring him in.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.008
And I was racing the
storm on top of all that,

23:29.041 --> 23:31.043
and I just, I fucked up.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.781
All right?

23:37.249 --> 23:39.018
But it is what it is.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.288
Don't tell me you never
cut corners trying

23:42.288 --> 23:44.223
to get where you're at.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.361
- Okay.

23:49.395 --> 23:52.364
The Risperdal keeps
him stable, right?

23:52.364 --> 23:55.101
Why don't we just
give it to him?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.704
Keep him calm for the next few
hours till the storm passes

23:57.737 --> 23:59.405
and you two can get
the fuck out of here.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.940
- No way.
- Why not?

24:00.940 --> 24:04.210
- Because that lunatic
is somehow more dangerous

24:04.210 --> 24:05.277
on that shit.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.580
Trust me, I've seen it.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.717
He's a fucking loose cannon.

24:10.717 --> 24:15.321
He'd kill us all before
midnight given the chance.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.989
- You don't think I can hold
him another eight hours,

24:16.989 --> 24:18.124
do you?

24:18.124 --> 24:18.958
- I didn't say that.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.226
- Yeah, you did.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.094
Maybe not with your
mouth, but you did.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.295
Huh?

24:23.295 --> 24:24.463
That little comment
about cutting corners.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.132
- All I'm saying,

24:26.165 --> 24:30.770
is you don't know that slippery
motherfucker like I do.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.507
(sighing)

24:34.507 --> 24:36.008
Listen, I'm sorry.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.679
All right?

24:39.679 --> 24:42.949
I didn't plan on
bringing him here.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.083
Shit happens.

24:45.585 --> 24:49.689
But this is what you
signed up for, right?

24:49.689 --> 24:53.092
Better than pushing
record cards all day.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.998
Either you're a deputy or
you're just pretending to be.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.836
You have to make that
fucking choice tonight.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.889
(Jelly muttering)

25:23.856 --> 25:25.191
- Hey, look, uh,

25:25.224 --> 25:27.159
hey, Mr. Marlborough Man.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.729
You know, I know you've
had a busy day and all,

25:29.729 --> 25:33.733
but your friend Jelly
over has got an emergency.

25:35.534 --> 25:39.739
Is there any chance you can
roll me your toilet paper?

25:39.806 --> 25:42.141
I'm begging you, man.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.744
I'm in a lot of pain over here.

26:21.914 --> 26:22.749
Oh, yes.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.885
No, no, no, no, no.

26:29.789 --> 26:30.690
Oh, got it.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.860
Listen, my friend.

26:33.860 --> 26:38.230
I don't care what Rollins
and pretty coplady say,

26:38.264 --> 26:39.699
you're a saint.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.900
You're a lifesaver.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.101
I love you.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.435
I owe you one, man.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.370
I really do.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.237
Whew.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.710
(water plopping)

26:50.743 --> 26:53.412
(Jelly moaning)

26:55.715 --> 26:56.582
Oh God, oh.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.221
(sighing)

27:02.254 --> 27:03.089
Whew.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.894
- So Russell, tell me
everything about him.

27:10.997 --> 27:14.166
- He wet the bed
until he was 15.

27:14.233 --> 27:18.470
That was the first sign
something wasn't right.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.775
He spent his teen years
lighting things on fire.

27:22.809 --> 27:26.145
Just any inanimate
object he could find.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.818
It was just small
stuff at first,

27:31.818 --> 27:35.187
but like any junkie,
the sensation fades.

27:38.157 --> 27:38.991
Right?

27:39.992 --> 27:42.661
He moved on to bigger stuff.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.495
Animals.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.498
He used to film it, too.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.703
You can just about
guess the rest.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.372
Impulsivity, a need for control,

27:54.874 --> 27:57.543
sheer lack of guilt and remorse.

27:59.545 --> 28:03.682
Plus his parents used to
just think he was special.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.551
The shrink went for it.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.823
It's crazy how something can
be right in front of your face

28:10.857 --> 28:13.025
and you just don't see it.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.996
(thunder crashing)

28:17.029 --> 28:17.864
- Pisces?

28:20.066 --> 28:20.900
- What?

28:22.735 --> 28:25.404
- Well I read most
serial killers,

28:25.471 --> 28:29.041
they usually kind of
turn out to be Pisces.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.011
- Well, what are you?

28:34.546 --> 28:35.581
- Me?

28:35.581 --> 28:36.415
I'm a Leo.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.652
- [Adams] Shit.

28:40.652 --> 28:41.854
- It's okay, it's
just the breaker.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.256
This building is
over 50 years old.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.758
Backup will come on any minutes.

28:45.825 --> 28:46.658
- How do you know?

28:46.658 --> 28:47.593
(thunder crashing)

28:47.593 --> 28:48.427
- See?

28:49.428 --> 28:50.662
- But the cell doors?

28:50.696 --> 28:52.598
- They're on a
different breaker.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.266
It should be okay as
long as it stays on.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.935
- So you don't know for sure?

28:55.935 --> 28:56.769
- Shit.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.437
Where are you going?

29:02.241 --> 29:03.175
- Oh.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.377
You've got to be kidding me.

29:07.246 --> 29:10.950
The day just keeps
getting better and better.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.686
Hey, Rollins?

29:14.720 --> 29:15.754
You out here?

29:18.457 --> 29:20.292
This isn't funny, man.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.029
Marlborough Guy?

29:26.032 --> 29:26.866
Anybody?

29:29.101 --> 29:31.270
What the fuck's happening?

30:16.015 --> 30:21.020
(thunder crashing)
(tense music)

30:39.972 --> 30:44.944
(knife slicing)
(Jelly gasping)

31:12.371 --> 31:15.241
(thunder crashing)

31:18.477 --> 31:19.378
- Oh, fuck.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.183
He's gone.

31:27.853 --> 31:28.887
- So's Jelly.

31:32.858 --> 31:33.692
- Oh, man.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.195
So the cell doors, they
were knocked offline

31:36.228 --> 31:37.063
because of the storm.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.230
What about the exits?

31:38.230 --> 31:39.065
Windows?

31:39.065 --> 31:39.898
Doors?

31:40.766 --> 31:42.501
Rollins, the exits?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.536
- Exit doors only
open with my key.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.538
Storm or no storm.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.207
No one gets out of
unless I say so.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.209
- All right, so he's
locked in with us.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.944
- Jesus, is that a good thing?

31:51.944 --> 31:53.379
- I sure as shit ain't
spending another three years

31:53.412 --> 31:55.747
of my life tracking him down.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.122
(tense music)

32:12.531 --> 32:13.365
- Shit.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.270
God damn it.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.140
What are we going to do?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.309
The lines are down.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.077
Can't call for backup.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.313
- You're sure he's
locked in here, right?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.547
- That's right.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.418
- He'll be looking to kill us.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.886
Just for the fucking
inconvenience we've caused.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.623
He won't be happy with just
one body under his belt.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.591
And he'll be looking for these.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.659
It's his fix.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.729
So we stick together
at all times, right?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.998
We can clear this building
room by room until we find him.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.666
Then we'll lock him somewhere

32:47.666 --> 32:49.668
where the locks
can't go offline.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.004
Either that, or we kill him.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.806
- Kill him?

32:54.840 --> 32:57.776
- It's better than
him killing us.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.011
- Yeah.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.780
- Fuck, does this
place have an armory?

33:19.198 --> 33:20.932
- I got this out
of the squad car.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.034
- Oh, thanks.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.040
So this is it?

33:28.107 --> 33:29.875
This is all the
firepower you've got?

33:29.875 --> 33:31.043
- Yeah, we're a small county.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.711
We don't have any action here.

33:32.711 --> 33:33.945
- Okay, good.

33:33.979 --> 33:37.349
At least we know he
don't have a gun.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.184
- Wait.

33:38.184 --> 33:39.017
The hat.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.219
The fucking knife.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.453
- Yeah, how do you think
he killed your friend

33:41.453 --> 33:42.621
in Cell Block A?

33:42.654 --> 33:44.790
He got in when the door
was knocked offline.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.792
- [Rollins] God damn it.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.696
- So, where do we start?

33:59.004 --> 34:00.038
Lead the way.

34:01.240 --> 34:06.212
(thunder crashing)
(tense music)

34:29.701 --> 34:31.203
- [Rollins] Clear.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.043
- Clear.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.283
Clear.

35:10.576 --> 35:11.743
Are you clear?

35:16.114 --> 35:16.948
- Nothing.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.722
(thunder crashing)

35:47.346 --> 35:50.081
(knife scraping)

35:55.654 --> 35:58.357
(knife scraping)

36:14.206 --> 36:15.307
- It's clear.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.846
- Check that one right there.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.319
- [Adams] Clear.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.025
- [Rollins] Clear.

36:42.668 --> 36:43.502
Clear.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.306
- [Adams] It's clear.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.854
- [Rollins] Clear.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.057
- It's locked.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.767
- The sheriff's
already cleared out.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.269
- Check it anyway.

37:21.673 --> 37:26.678
(thunder crashing)
(tense music)

38:28.239 --> 38:29.307
- It's clear.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.243
- Check it out.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.115
Here we go.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.129
(gun firing)
(Adams gasping)

38:51.162 --> 38:52.130
It's just mice.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.665
It's just mice.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.833
- Fucking rats.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.101
- [Adams] Oh shit,
you scared me.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.302
You scared me.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.004
- Me, too.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.139
- Get down!

39:01.172 --> 39:02.140
Get down!

39:02.140 --> 39:05.544
(knife slicing)
(tense music)

39:05.544 --> 39:07.946
(gun firing)

39:11.683 --> 39:12.518
Fuck!

39:22.160 --> 39:22.994
Are you all right?

39:22.994 --> 39:23.895
- Ah!

39:23.895 --> 39:25.697
The fucker just cut my neck.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.065
- You'll be fine.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.106
(dramatic music)

40:59.290 --> 41:00.458
- Did he get away?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.259
- Yeah.

41:03.161 --> 41:06.397
We need a way to
section this area off.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.769
- How the hell are
we going to do that?

41:10.802 --> 41:13.639
- Can you lock
this corridor down?

41:16.508 --> 41:17.576
- By hand.

41:17.609 --> 41:18.977
- Okay, do it.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.245
I'll cover you.

41:21.446 --> 41:24.115
We'll keep him out of this wing.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.833
Did you see that
handprint on the wall?

41:42.834 --> 41:43.669
He's hit.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.471
If we're lucky it
will set off a trail.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.839
Follow the blood.

42:01.019 --> 42:01.987
All right.

42:02.020 --> 42:02.854
- That's it.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.022
- Let's do it.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.892
All right.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.093
That takes care of the north
end and the women's block.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.196
So he's not in any
of those two places.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.564
- I locked the cage.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.901
He can't get back in
there without a key.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.670
I'm going to try
the phones again.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.672
See if I can't get a line out.

42:53.672 --> 42:56.942
- You know it's useless, right?

42:56.942 --> 42:59.110
- Well excuse me for trying.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.345
Better than being stuck here

43:00.378 --> 43:02.914
with Russel Fucking
Scissorhands.

43:06.051 --> 43:06.885
- Nice.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.295
I told you.

43:17.295 --> 43:18.463
- God damn it!

43:22.100 --> 43:24.135
It's been hours since
it started raining.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.303
- [Adams] They don't call it

43:25.370 --> 43:27.973
the storm of the
decade for nothing.

43:29.274 --> 43:32.143
- Where are we going to go now?

43:32.210 --> 43:35.313
- We just keep
clearing the building.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.983
It's two against
one, we'll find him.

43:38.049 --> 43:40.118
- Some fucking first day.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.287
Yeah.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.990
You know I was about to call in.

43:46.992 --> 43:50.161
Take the weekend
to think it over.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.930
Go to the stockyards.

43:53.799 --> 43:55.000
- Stockyards?

43:55.000 --> 43:55.834
- Yeah.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.603
Cowboy camp.

44:00.438 --> 44:03.308
I used to sleep there on the
weekends when I was younger.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.810
During the summer.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.148
- You were a cowboy?

44:11.482 --> 44:12.317
- Was.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.794
- Tell me why you became a cop.

44:22.828 --> 44:23.661
- What?

44:23.661 --> 44:24.495
Why?

44:25.496 --> 44:26.698
- [Adams] Just do it.

44:26.698 --> 44:29.367
- I think we have bigger
fucking problems here.

44:29.434 --> 44:34.439
- I mean of all the places to
go and start a life, why here?

44:36.441 --> 44:39.310
- Where am I going to go?

44:39.344 --> 44:42.047
I was born in this town.

44:42.047 --> 44:44.382
That's the way it is.

44:44.449 --> 44:48.119
You start a life here,
it ends the same way.

44:50.021 --> 44:54.125
My family's been doing
it for generations.

44:54.159 --> 44:57.662
I figured being a deputy
was the best thing

44:57.662 --> 45:00.398
to do for the community.

45:00.398 --> 45:05.236
A way to give back to something
that's given so much to me.

45:06.671 --> 45:08.539
- Given so much to you?

45:10.375 --> 45:11.209
Like what?

45:14.212 --> 45:15.881
You know, like what?

45:17.015 --> 45:19.550
Help me understand
what you mean.

45:21.987 --> 45:25.690
- You see right through
it, don't you, Adams?

45:27.192 --> 45:28.226
(sighing)

45:28.226 --> 45:30.829
I stayed for my father, family.

45:34.565 --> 45:38.569
Truth be told, I wanted
to be a team roper.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.738
I wanted to travel.

45:40.772 --> 45:42.607
I wanted to do anything
besides grow up

45:42.673 --> 45:46.377
and live in a shithole town
like this the rest of my life.

45:46.411 --> 45:49.747
But life finds a way
of getting in front

45:51.549 --> 45:55.720
of the things you want
and makes you settle

45:55.753 --> 45:57.755
for the things you need.

46:00.091 --> 46:05.030
- So what did your daddy think
about your new career choice?

46:06.264 --> 46:07.398
- Don't matter what he thinks.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.266
He's dead.

46:13.104 --> 46:16.241
But he'd have done anything
to keep me off of that rope.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.376
Keep me off of the arena.

46:19.377 --> 46:22.380
Living that life that he led.

46:22.380 --> 46:25.750
But I fell for it,
hook, line and sinker.

46:28.253 --> 46:32.757
- Why wouldn't he want you
to follow in his footsteps?

46:32.757 --> 46:34.592
- Hard living.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.394
Ain't no money in it.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.966
- Well if you don't
know what you want,

46:40.966 --> 46:44.069
you ain't never
going to find it.

46:44.102 --> 46:46.604
You'll always settle for less.

46:48.907 --> 46:51.609
You'll wander around
aimlessly wondering

46:51.642 --> 46:54.512
how the hell did
life land me here?

46:57.082 --> 46:58.249
- How do you know this?

46:58.283 --> 46:59.117
Huh?

46:59.117 --> 47:00.852
Your vast experience?

47:02.753 --> 47:04.589
- I was talking about you.

47:04.622 --> 47:05.456
Not me.

47:07.758 --> 47:08.593
- Tell me.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.336
- I'm a Texas gal.

47:20.838 --> 47:23.274
Coke really means Doctor Pepper.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.011
Can't have the Alamo
without "Lonesome Dove",

47:26.011 --> 47:28.446
and all the roses are yellow.

47:32.450 --> 47:35.186
I like a beer just as
much as the next guy but,

47:35.186 --> 47:38.289
Rollins, what I am
ain't about valor.

47:42.793 --> 47:45.964
I live my life
like my daddy did.

47:45.964 --> 47:47.698
His daddy before him.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.702
Eight seconds at a time.

47:57.242 --> 48:00.912
Only I do it with the
fucking handbreak off.

48:09.820 --> 48:10.721
Come on.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.890
We've still got work to do.

48:15.026 --> 48:17.695
(toilet flushing)

48:17.728 --> 48:21.166
- How long have you
been a deputy, Adams?

48:24.035 --> 48:25.536
- Longer than you.

48:26.704 --> 48:30.041
- Everybody's been a
deputy longer than me.

48:33.178 --> 48:34.179
- Six years.

48:38.516 --> 48:42.187
- You spent half of your
career chasing this asshole?

48:42.187 --> 48:44.022
- Something like that.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.194
Ready?

48:50.461 --> 48:51.296
- Yeah.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.313
It's the weight room.

49:08.379 --> 49:10.381
We circled back around.

49:10.415 --> 49:12.283
- I'm right behind you.

49:32.137 --> 49:32.937
Anything?

49:35.073 --> 49:36.341
- Nothing.

49:36.341 --> 49:37.275
- All right.

49:37.308 --> 49:38.476
Let's knock it off the list.

49:38.476 --> 49:39.410
You can lock the
door on our way out.

49:39.444 --> 49:40.778
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:40.778 --> 49:41.946
- What is it?

49:41.979 --> 49:45.750
- I don't fucking
know, but I heard it.

49:45.750 --> 49:46.751
(tense music)

49:46.784 --> 49:48.119
(clattering)

49:48.119 --> 49:48.953
Whoa!

49:48.953 --> 49:50.255
Where are you going?

49:50.255 --> 49:51.089
- I heard someone in the hall.

49:51.089 --> 49:51.922
- Yeah, no shit.

49:51.922 --> 49:52.757
But what did you say?

49:52.757 --> 49:54.692
Stick together, right?

49:54.692 --> 49:56.461
- Don't tell me you're
afraid of the dark.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.829
- First we check here,
then we'll check there.

49:58.829 --> 49:59.664
Okay?

49:59.664 --> 50:00.498
Together.

50:00.498 --> 50:01.432
All right?

50:01.432 --> 50:02.967
- Excuse me.
- Fuck.

50:13.478 --> 50:14.379
Adams?

50:14.379 --> 50:15.213
Adams!

50:18.716 --> 50:21.119
Adams, open the fucking door!

50:22.053 --> 50:22.887
Adams!

50:24.289 --> 50:25.456
Adams, open the fucking door!

50:25.490 --> 50:27.858
(clattering)

50:44.542 --> 50:45.743
Adams!

50:45.810 --> 50:46.877
Fucking bitch!

50:46.877 --> 50:48.346
Fuck!

50:48.379 --> 50:53.050
(grunting)
(tense music)

51:04.028 --> 51:08.533
* We three kings be
stealing the gold *

51:16.941 --> 51:19.710
(horse neighing)

51:38.429 --> 51:41.199
(door squeaking)

51:53.878 --> 51:56.581
- What did she
tell you about me?

52:03.621 --> 52:04.622
Where is it?

52:19.170 --> 52:20.171
Where is it?

52:26.311 --> 52:27.945
- I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.514
- You don't know what
I'm talking about,

52:29.514 --> 52:33.284
you are so full of shit,
your eyes are brown.

52:38.589 --> 52:41.626
Son, I can tell
when a man is lying.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.961
I'm looking at
your fucking eyes.

52:43.961 --> 52:45.162
You are a liar.

52:47.432 --> 52:49.133
- [Rollins] Fuck you.

52:55.306 --> 52:57.642
- I should tell you, these work.

52:57.642 --> 52:59.977
- Where the fuck
did you get those?

52:59.977 --> 53:01.312
Huh?

53:01.312 --> 53:04.048
What the fuck did
you do with her?

53:06.317 --> 53:08.553
(grunting)

53:10.821 --> 53:11.656
- Hey.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.959
I'm asking the questions.

53:17.662 --> 53:20.831
You are tied to a
fucking chair by me.

53:26.837 --> 53:27.738
- Fuck you.

53:27.738 --> 53:29.640
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

53:29.674 --> 53:31.008
Hey, look at me.

53:32.176 --> 53:34.979
You wanted to fuck
her, didn't you?

53:37.081 --> 53:38.983
- Fuck you!
- Yep.

53:39.016 --> 53:42.520
You thought you was
going to fuck her.

53:42.520 --> 53:46.891
I tell you what, you respect
me, or you respect this.

53:48.759 --> 53:52.397
Now you tell me
where the fuck it is.

53:52.397 --> 53:53.898
Right now.

53:53.931 --> 53:58.002
Or so help me, God, you will
not have blue eyes anymore,

53:58.035 --> 53:59.504
you get me?

53:59.504 --> 54:00.405
- Okay, okay.

54:00.405 --> 54:01.339
Okay!

54:01.372 --> 54:02.373
- Okay what?
- Okay.

54:02.407 --> 54:03.374
Just get Adams.

54:03.374 --> 54:04.208
Get Adams.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.042
Get Adams!

54:05.042 --> 54:05.943
Adams!

54:05.943 --> 54:07.111
- You want me to get Adams?

54:07.177 --> 54:08.446
- Get Adams.
- And bring her here?

54:08.446 --> 54:10.214
- She'll know what
you're looking for.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.181
Yes.

54:11.181 --> 54:12.383
She can help you find it, man.

54:12.417 --> 54:14.852
She can fucking
help you find it.

54:14.852 --> 54:16.020
- Interesting.

54:18.222 --> 54:21.726
Well, I guess I
better go get Adams.

54:21.759 --> 54:22.593
Okay.

54:28.733 --> 54:30.535
- Motherfucker.

54:30.535 --> 54:32.637
(door clicking)

54:32.637 --> 54:34.805
- Here she is, pretty boy.

54:35.973 --> 54:36.974
Adams, stay.

54:49.053 --> 54:51.956
All right, your boy here
wants to play games,

54:51.956 --> 54:53.458
so let's play some
fucking games.

54:53.491 --> 54:55.259
- Please tell him
where they are.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.293
- How about Operation.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.595
That's fun and games.

54:57.595 --> 54:58.496
- Wait.

54:58.496 --> 55:00.064
- This is your last chance.

55:00.097 --> 55:00.931
- No.

55:00.931 --> 55:01.899
Please don't.

55:01.899 --> 55:02.733
- Wait!

55:04.234 --> 55:07.237
We'll give you
whatever you want, man.

55:07.271 --> 55:08.973
I still don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.441
- Tell him where it is, Rollins.

55:10.475 --> 55:12.076
Please, just tell
him where it is.

55:12.076 --> 55:13.411
Tell him where it is, Rollins.

55:13.411 --> 55:14.278
Please.

55:14.311 --> 55:15.513
- What?
- You have to.

55:15.513 --> 55:17.348
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

55:17.348 --> 55:18.516
- He's going to kill me.

55:18.516 --> 55:19.750
Please.

55:19.784 --> 55:20.651
- Wait!

55:20.651 --> 55:22.286
All right.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.821
I was in records, man.

55:23.821 --> 55:26.156
I know where everything
is in this building, okay.

55:26.156 --> 55:26.991
Okay?

55:26.991 --> 55:27.825
Okay?

55:27.825 --> 55:29.126
Okay.

55:29.159 --> 55:29.994
Okay.

55:30.928 --> 55:31.762
Yeah.

55:31.762 --> 55:32.930
We're gonna find it.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.164
We're gonna find it.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.166
I just don't know
what it is yet.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.802
- This bitch knows.

55:41.038 --> 55:41.872
- What?

55:45.142 --> 55:46.176
- The buckle.

55:49.514 --> 55:51.682
- What?
- The belt buckle.

55:52.983 --> 55:55.853
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

55:55.853 --> 55:58.956
(Adams sighing)

55:58.989 --> 56:00.558
- [Russell] Whoops.

56:08.198 --> 56:11.702
(Adams sighing)

56:11.702 --> 56:13.804
- You went a little
heavy, don't you think?

56:13.838 --> 56:17.174
- [Russell] You said
make it believable.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.247
- You two motherfuckers.

56:23.247 --> 56:25.516
You're in it together, huh?

56:28.553 --> 56:29.487
- Surprise.

56:34.692 --> 56:35.760
Abner Outlaw.

56:36.927 --> 56:37.995
You know him?

56:40.731 --> 56:41.932
Of course you do.

56:41.932 --> 56:43.901
All those nights spent
at the cowboy camp.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.870
You heard the stories, right?

56:45.903 --> 56:46.737
- [Rollins] I know them.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.205
So what?

56:48.238 --> 56:52.009
- So you know that Abner could
do anything in the arena.

56:52.009 --> 56:54.712
(crowd cheering)

56:56.080 --> 56:59.950
Generation after generation
of championship rodeo.

57:00.017 --> 57:04.922
And just like all the Texas
Rangers before him, he wore it

57:05.556 --> 57:06.524
on his belt.

57:08.526 --> 57:11.028
One buckle more than the rest.

57:14.932 --> 57:19.269
His great grandfather's
1920 gold-plated Cow Palace.

57:24.975 --> 57:28.713
- I don't have anything
to do with that.

57:28.746 --> 57:31.916
- I think you do, records boy.

57:31.916 --> 57:34.885
He was here three weeks ago.

57:34.885 --> 57:36.386
He came in on D and D.

57:36.386 --> 57:38.255
He spent a night in
the tank on his way

57:38.288 --> 57:41.258
to Colorado Springs
for a PRCA auction.

57:41.258 --> 57:44.595
When he booked in,
he had the buckle.

57:44.629 --> 57:47.131
And when he checked out, gone.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.903
- Why don't you just ask him?

57:52.937 --> 57:53.771
Hmm?

57:55.472 --> 57:58.576
- We know that it's
here, record boy.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.012
Abner had a suit
against your sheriff

58:02.012 --> 58:06.016
and this county because
it was stolen here.

58:06.083 --> 58:07.618
- By who?

58:07.652 --> 58:10.955
I've got nothing
to do with this.

58:10.955 --> 58:12.790
I'm fucking brand new.

58:14.358 --> 58:18.195
- Smart money says you
know where they hid it.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.170
- [Rollins] Who?

58:27.838 --> 58:29.039
- Your sheriff.

58:30.541 --> 58:34.612
- Why the fuck would he
do something like that?

58:34.645 --> 58:37.381
(Adams laughing)

58:38.716 --> 58:41.351
- Because Abner Outlaw's
buckle, sold to the right buyer

58:41.351 --> 58:45.055
is worth over a quarter
of a million dollars.

58:46.323 --> 58:47.992
- You planned this.

58:47.992 --> 58:49.894
You've been planning
this all night.

58:49.894 --> 58:52.563
- Well he's finally catching on.

58:53.831 --> 58:55.032
Yeah, you know what?

58:55.032 --> 58:57.902
I've been planning
this night all week.

58:59.469 --> 59:02.139
So here's what's
going to happen.

59:04.809 --> 59:08.713
You're going to take me
to the property room,

59:08.713 --> 59:11.916
because you know
where that is, right?

59:11.982 --> 59:13.984
You know where they hide things

59:13.984 --> 59:16.887
they don't want no
one else to see.

59:21.325 --> 59:22.159
Right?

59:27.732 --> 59:29.734
- [Rollins] Crazy bitch.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.338
- And one more thing.

59:35.172 --> 59:36.073
(gun firing)

59:36.073 --> 59:38.275
- Ah, Jesus fucking Christ!

59:38.342 --> 59:39.677
Jesus Christ!

59:39.710 --> 59:41.879
Why the fuck did you do that?

59:41.912 --> 59:43.247
You crazy bitch.

59:45.950 --> 59:47.551
- Three is a crowd.

59:49.119 --> 59:51.455
But look on the bright side,

59:57.594 --> 59:59.964
if you play your cards right,

1:00:02.967 --> 1:00:04.969
you might get his share.

1:00:08.205 --> 1:00:10.440
(sniffing)

1:00:16.146 --> 1:00:17.381
You smell good.

1:00:19.249 --> 1:00:21.618
So you want to have some fun?

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:29.126
Hey, whoa.

1:00:29.126 --> 1:00:29.960
I said property.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:31.095
This is your office.

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:32.296
- I know that.

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:34.999
You think if he wanted
a $250,000 belt buckle

1:00:35.065 --> 1:00:36.901
he'd just leave it
out in the open?

1:00:36.934 --> 1:00:40.004
I'm looking for keys
to the basement.

1:00:41.772 --> 1:00:44.074
Was any of it true?

1:00:44.074 --> 1:00:45.609
Russell?

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:47.111
The pills?

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:50.915
Jesus Christ, are you
even a real fucking cop?

1:00:52.950 --> 1:00:54.618
- Russell is crazy.

1:00:54.618 --> 1:00:56.120
Well, he was crazy.

1:00:59.957 --> 1:01:01.792
I met him up in Reno.

1:01:01.826 --> 1:01:05.195
He came in handy
when he needed to.

1:01:05.195 --> 1:01:06.997
He was a fucking junkie.

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:08.699
He'd sell that buckle
in three months

1:01:08.766 --> 1:01:12.102
and be out on the street,
looking to score again.

1:01:12.136 --> 1:01:14.471
Can't trust a guy like that.

1:01:16.673 --> 1:01:19.009
As for me, I'm a rodeo girl.

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:22.847
- Rodeo?

1:01:22.847 --> 1:01:23.680
- Yeah.

1:01:25.549 --> 1:01:28.318
You and me, we have
something in common.

1:01:28.352 --> 1:01:29.854
Two peas in a pod.

1:01:32.890 --> 1:01:35.059
I grew up on a horse farm.

1:01:37.361 --> 1:01:39.063
I still love to ride.

1:01:41.465 --> 1:01:44.802
Dressage, events and
jumping, all of it.

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:50.975
The problem was, the minute
the oil rigs dried up,

1:01:50.975 --> 1:01:52.676
my daddy lost it all.

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:56.213
The farm.

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:57.014
300 acres.

1:01:58.015 --> 1:02:00.484
The house not long after that.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.720
The horses were all that
we had left to sell,

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:05.655
and that's what we did.

1:02:08.258 --> 1:02:11.228
I guess it's a no brainer.

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:16.100
The choice between livestock
and putting food on the table.

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:20.537
- So that's what
all this is about?

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:21.772
Jesus.

1:02:21.772 --> 1:02:24.108
And I thought I
had daddy issues.

1:02:25.843 --> 1:02:29.346
- I traded horse trials
for tie-down calf roping,

1:02:29.379 --> 1:02:32.883
so don't you fucking
tell me about issues.

1:02:34.251 --> 1:02:38.355
Most the guys my age couldn't
hang for as long as I did.

1:02:38.388 --> 1:02:39.924
- So what happened?

1:02:43.627 --> 1:02:47.297
- I heard all the
same story as you.

1:02:47.297 --> 1:02:48.565
Outlaw's stuck.

1:02:50.034 --> 1:02:53.037
I laid the charge
on breaker myself.

1:02:54.038 --> 1:02:55.806
And you in here alone.

1:02:56.941 --> 1:03:00.210
A deputy for all of 36 hours.

1:03:00.210 --> 1:03:01.545
Easy to convince.

1:03:02.913 --> 1:03:03.914
- And Jelly?

1:03:07.617 --> 1:03:09.319
- Who the fuck cares?

1:03:10.955 --> 1:03:11.788
Right?

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:13.623
Collateral damage.

1:03:13.623 --> 1:03:15.092
Shit happens.

1:03:15.092 --> 1:03:16.493
- Yeah, I got it.

1:03:19.096 --> 1:03:20.430
Now there looks like
there's a reason

1:03:20.430 --> 1:03:21.832
for both of us to get
the belt buckle, huh?

1:03:21.832 --> 1:03:23.300
Isn't that right?

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:24.134
- Oh, no.

1:03:24.134 --> 1:03:25.802
That buckle is mine.

1:03:28.605 --> 1:03:30.841
- You've been planning
this night all week?

1:03:30.841 --> 1:03:33.177
I've been planning
this shit all month.

1:03:33.243 --> 1:03:36.080
(thunder crashing)

1:03:36.113 --> 1:03:36.981
- Oh, shit.

1:03:42.486 --> 1:03:44.754
First night on the job, eh?

1:03:46.756 --> 1:03:47.591
Hmm.

1:03:50.494 --> 1:03:52.096
- The rain stopped.

1:03:52.129 --> 1:03:53.697
I guess we have a
decision to make.

1:03:53.697 --> 1:03:55.032
- Not really.

1:03:55.099 --> 1:03:56.766
I ain't going in
with no partner.

1:03:56.766 --> 1:03:58.102
Put the gun down and
get on your knees.

1:03:58.102 --> 1:04:00.337
(Adams scoffing)

1:04:00.337 --> 1:04:01.605
- No chance.

1:04:01.638 --> 1:04:03.773
- You have me pegged
all wrong, Adams.

1:04:03.773 --> 1:04:06.443
You don't know a thing about me.

1:04:08.012 --> 1:04:12.316
- Well I do know you're
just pretending to be a cop.

1:04:12.316 --> 1:04:13.951
Kind of like me.

1:04:13.951 --> 1:04:16.486
- You shouldn't have come here.

1:04:17.654 --> 1:04:19.356
(gun firing)

1:04:19.356 --> 1:04:20.190
Fuck.

1:04:24.161 --> 1:04:27.031
(Rollins grunting)

1:04:32.636 --> 1:04:33.470
Adams!

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:37.874
Where are you?

1:04:47.684 --> 1:04:48.518
Oh, Adams.

1:04:51.989 --> 1:04:54.024
Jelly is looking for you.

1:04:56.927 --> 1:04:59.529
Where are you, you crazy bitch?

1:05:18.715 --> 1:05:19.549
Adams.

1:05:23.187 --> 1:05:24.221
(Adams grunting)

1:05:24.254 --> 1:05:25.089
Oh, shit!

1:05:27.357 --> 1:05:30.227
(Rollins grunting)

1:05:36.466 --> 1:05:37.801
Die, bitch, die!

1:05:38.902 --> 1:05:41.305
(grunting)

1:05:41.305 --> 1:05:42.306
Get up.

1:05:42.306 --> 1:05:43.140
Get up!

1:05:44.208 --> 1:05:45.309
Against the wall.

1:05:45.309 --> 1:05:46.376
Against the wall.

1:05:46.410 --> 1:05:47.911
Whoa, little lamb.

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:51.115
You're under arrest.

1:05:51.148 --> 1:05:53.383
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:05:53.417 --> 1:05:55.919
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1:05:55.952 --> 1:05:57.221
in a court of law.

1:05:57.221 --> 1:05:58.722
You piece of shit.

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:02.792
- How long did it take
you to learn that?

1:06:02.792 --> 1:06:06.263
(Rollins yelling)

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:08.565
(exhaling)

1:06:09.566 --> 1:06:11.735
- Come on, motherfucker.

1:06:11.735 --> 1:06:12.569
- Rollins.

1:06:12.569 --> 1:06:15.105
- Fucking wild animal.

1:06:15.139 --> 1:06:16.306
- Oh, Rollins.

1:06:17.307 --> 1:06:19.076
- Shut up.
- No, no, no.

1:06:19.109 --> 1:06:19.943
You-
- Shh.

1:06:21.745 --> 1:06:24.681
- Hey, hey you don't-
- Shh.

1:06:24.681 --> 1:06:25.849
Shh.

1:06:25.915 --> 1:06:26.583
- You don't have
to put me in there.

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:27.317
- Oh, no?

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:28.152
Why?

1:06:28.152 --> 1:06:28.985
Why not?

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:30.154
- No please.

1:06:30.187 --> 1:06:31.121
Please don't put me in there-
- Oh, no.

1:06:31.155 --> 1:06:32.089
You'll like it in there with

1:06:32.089 --> 1:06:32.989
all that mumbo jumbo the fuck

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:35.325
you were talking about earlier?

1:06:36.493 --> 1:06:37.527
Huh?

1:06:37.594 --> 1:06:38.795
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:39.863
- What, what?

1:06:40.964 --> 1:06:41.798
- Hey, what?

1:06:41.798 --> 1:06:42.666
Why?

1:06:42.666 --> 1:06:44.601
If you had-
- Huh?

1:06:44.634 --> 1:06:47.271
- If you had it this
whole time, why did you,

1:06:47.271 --> 1:06:48.205
why did you wait?

1:06:48.205 --> 1:06:49.673
Why?

1:06:49.673 --> 1:06:53.677
- Well, before you killed
him Jelly was my escape plan.

1:06:53.710 --> 1:06:55.545
All he had to do
was take that buckle

1:06:55.612 --> 1:06:57.681
and meet me after my shift.

1:06:57.681 --> 1:06:59.849
I had his charges dropped.

1:07:03.153 --> 1:07:05.155
Fuck all that now, huh?

1:07:05.155 --> 1:07:07.324
- You trusted him?

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:08.692
- Yeah, more than you.

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:10.960
Get your fucking ass in there.

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.196
Fucking animal.

1:07:14.964 --> 1:07:15.999
Turn around.

1:07:16.032 --> 1:07:17.501
- Is that how you like it?

1:07:17.501 --> 1:07:19.236
- Shut the fuck
up, you sick freak.

1:07:19.236 --> 1:07:20.237
Turn around.

1:07:24.474 --> 1:07:28.345
After all this is over,
I suggest you get help.

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:30.580
All right.

1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:33.250
If you fucking
need anything, Hey!

1:07:34.218 --> 1:07:35.419
Get your shit out of my face.

1:07:35.485 --> 1:07:36.920
- Rollins, Rollins,
Rollins, Rollins,

1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:39.089
Rollins, Rollins, Rollins.

1:08:04.848 --> 1:08:06.850
(whistling)

1:08:06.850 --> 1:08:08.618
- Whew whee.

1:08:08.618 --> 1:08:09.719
Look at that.

1:08:09.753 --> 1:08:10.920
- [Adams] Just, just let me-

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:12.256
- Is this was
everybody died for?

1:08:12.256 --> 1:08:13.423
- [Adams] Just let me touch it.

1:08:13.457 --> 1:08:14.724
I just want to
touch it one time.

1:08:14.758 --> 1:08:16.925
Just let-
- Get your hands out of here.

1:08:16.925 --> 1:08:18.428
It ain't much when
you look at it.

1:08:18.461 --> 1:08:19.962
It's a damn shame.

1:08:22.866 --> 1:08:24.434
Well, adios, Adams.

1:08:25.402 --> 1:08:26.303
- Hey, hey.

1:08:27.771 --> 1:08:31.107
What are you, what are you
going to tell the sheriff?

1:08:31.107 --> 1:08:32.976
- (sighing) Let me think.

1:08:33.041 --> 1:08:33.877
I'm not.

1:08:33.877 --> 1:08:35.312
You are.

1:08:35.312 --> 1:08:37.281
- [Adams] Rollins.

1:08:37.281 --> 1:08:40.083
You and me, you and
me, we could be a team.

1:08:40.116 --> 1:08:40.950
- No, no.

1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:42.118
You're a smart girl.

1:08:42.118 --> 1:08:43.620
You'll figure something out.

1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:46.156
- Rollins, Rollins!
- Fuck you.

1:08:47.457 --> 1:08:48.291
- Fuck!

1:09:04.006 --> 1:09:04.841
Rollins.

1:09:13.649 --> 1:09:14.484
Rollins.

1:09:17.586 --> 1:09:18.587
Oh, Rollins.

1:09:24.928 --> 1:09:25.929
Hey, cowboy.

1:09:28.598 --> 1:09:29.433
Rollins.

1:09:41.478 --> 1:09:42.512
(Adams laughing)

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:44.514
- Give it to me.

1:09:44.514 --> 1:09:45.349
- Uh-uh.

1:09:47.783 --> 1:09:49.118
- Fucking snake.

1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:53.889
- Looks like we have
a decision to make.

1:09:53.889 --> 1:09:55.725
- What do you propose?

1:09:59.028 --> 1:10:00.464
- You let me out.

1:10:02.566 --> 1:10:03.733
Yeah?

1:10:03.733 --> 1:10:05.669
Then we can settle it up.

1:10:05.702 --> 1:10:06.536
50-50.

1:10:08.071 --> 1:10:09.172
- 70-30.

1:10:09.205 --> 1:10:10.039
- Nope, nope.

1:10:10.039 --> 1:10:11.708
No, no, no, no, no.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:12.541
No!

1:10:14.378 --> 1:10:15.645
I have the key.

1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:17.914
50-50.

1:10:19.549 --> 1:10:20.384
- Fuck you.

1:10:20.384 --> 1:10:21.217
Stay in there.

1:10:21.217 --> 1:10:22.050
I don't give a shit.

1:10:22.050 --> 1:10:22.886
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:10:22.886 --> 1:10:23.719
Yeah, yeah.

1:10:23.719 --> 1:10:24.921
Okay.

1:10:24.921 --> 1:10:28.425
Because then the sheriff
comes and nobody wins.

1:10:33.862 --> 1:10:35.499
- We sell it when I want.

1:10:35.499 --> 1:10:36.333
To who I want.

1:10:36.366 --> 1:10:37.200
Where I want.

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:38.034
Do you understand that?

1:10:38.034 --> 1:10:38.868
Say it!

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:43.373
- Sir, yes, sir.

1:10:45.409 --> 1:10:48.712
- I should have my
fucking head checked.

1:10:56.119 --> 1:10:59.121
- You and I are going to
have some fun together.

1:10:59.188 --> 1:11:00.189
- No we aren't.

1:11:00.223 --> 1:11:01.023
- Yeah.

1:11:02.925 --> 1:11:05.862
(Rollins grunting)

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:13.537
(Rollins groaning)

1:11:15.871 --> 1:11:17.206
- Fucking bitch.

1:11:26.282 --> 1:11:29.152
(Rollins groaning)

1:11:36.793 --> 1:11:39.563
- You know, Rollins,
I'm curious.

1:11:40.930 --> 1:11:42.932
Is that how you do
it in Tarrant County.

1:11:42.932 --> 1:11:43.767
Hmm?

1:11:46.736 --> 1:11:49.773
Is that how you
search your suspects?

1:11:51.074 --> 1:11:51.841
- Bitch.

1:11:53.677 --> 1:11:55.311
- Yeah.

1:11:55.311 --> 1:11:56.446
Well, I'm out.

1:11:58.982 --> 1:12:01.951
You shouldn't mess
with a Texas girl.

1:12:04.287 --> 1:12:06.956
(Adams humming)

1:12:15.999 --> 1:12:17.100
Later, gator.

1:12:20.603 --> 1:12:21.438
- Yes.

1:12:23.873 --> 1:12:25.273
No, I understand.

1:12:27.377 --> 1:12:29.212
Well I have seller
with me at the moment.

1:12:29.278 --> 1:12:32.816
So I'm going to have
to get back to you.

1:12:32.849 --> 1:12:33.717
Understood.

1:12:33.717 --> 1:12:36.152
We'll be in touch soon.

1:12:36.184 --> 1:12:37.454
Sorry about that.

1:12:37.454 --> 1:12:40.724
Lots of call this time of year.

1:12:40.724 --> 1:12:42.058
Well, all right.

1:12:42.959 --> 1:12:43.993
There she is.

1:12:45.529 --> 1:12:46.362
All right.

1:13:00.744 --> 1:13:01.811
- Are we good?

1:13:04.714 --> 1:13:07.250
- What did we agree to?

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:08.084
- 250.

1:13:10.153 --> 1:13:13.490
- 250 sounds about
right for this piece.

1:13:22.432 --> 1:13:23.266
250 bucks.

1:13:25.268 --> 1:13:28.037
(Adams laughing)

1:13:28.071 --> 1:13:29.606
- What's all this?

1:13:29.606 --> 1:13:31.074
Some kind of joke?

1:13:31.074 --> 1:13:32.041
- It's $250.

1:13:32.075 --> 1:13:34.243
And this is a counterfeit.

1:13:36.580 --> 1:13:37.681
- No, no, no.

1:13:39.082 --> 1:13:41.951
That is Abner Outlaw's buckle.

1:13:42.018 --> 1:13:43.853
We agreed to $250,000.

1:13:45.221 --> 1:13:50.059
Because this, this is
Abner Outlaw's belt buckle.

1:13:50.059 --> 1:13:52.061
- Okay, well, look here.

1:13:53.196 --> 1:13:57.200
Each Cow Palace original
dated prior to 1945

1:13:57.233 --> 1:14:02.138
is engraved with the year and
the finish number on the back.

1:14:03.306 --> 1:14:05.041
This buckle has
neither of those.

1:14:05.074 --> 1:14:06.275
I'm sorry.

1:14:06.275 --> 1:14:07.477
It's nothing more
than a counterfeit.

1:14:07.544 --> 1:14:10.112
- This is, this is
Outlaw's buckle.

1:14:10.112 --> 1:14:11.280
- It's a fake.

1:14:13.382 --> 1:14:14.618
- No, it's not.

1:14:17.452 --> 1:14:18.655
- I'm sorry.

1:14:18.722 --> 1:14:20.323
You can go and try and
find another buyer.

1:14:20.323 --> 1:14:22.791
But I've been doing
this for 25 years,

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:24.460
and what I just handed
you is more valuable

1:14:24.494 --> 1:14:27.396
than what I'm taking
in right here.

1:14:28.498 --> 1:14:29.332
I'm sorry.

1:14:34.571 --> 1:14:36.305
- This is his buckle.

1:14:50.353 --> 1:14:51.187
Fuck!

1:14:58.094 --> 1:15:00.463
(gun firing)

1:15:05.501 --> 1:15:06.536
- Jesus Christ, Abner.

1:15:06.536 --> 1:15:08.204
You scared the shit out of me.

1:15:08.204 --> 1:15:11.641
I didn't expect you
to be here this fast.

1:15:19.616 --> 1:15:22.952
- If Sheriff comes
looking, you call me.

1:15:28.357 --> 1:15:30.693
(whistling)

1:15:31.861 --> 1:15:32.696
- Rollins!

1:15:41.037 --> 1:15:41.871
Rollins?

1:15:51.246 --> 1:15:52.081
Rollins!

1:16:01.057 --> 1:16:03.827
How are you doing
in there, Jelly?

1:16:05.528 --> 1:16:06.362
Shit.

1:16:16.105 --> 1:16:18.608
(tense music)

1:17:05.054 --> 1:17:05.889
Rollins?

1:17:09.425 --> 1:17:10.259
Shit.

1:17:35.651 --> 1:17:36.485
Shit!

1:17:52.001 --> 1:17:52.835
Shit.

1:17:56.873 --> 1:17:59.375
(tense music)

1:18:02.344 --> 1:18:05.715
(tense electronic music)
