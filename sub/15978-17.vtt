WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:05.373
Ray, I got great news.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.308
I could use some.
I just got an e-mail saying

00:07.341 --> 00:09.477
all my Groupons are set
to expire this weekend.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.145
Okay... forget all that.

00:11.179 --> 00:15.649
I got two tickets to a charity
dinner with the president.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.021
Of the United States.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.493
Of America--
why are you not reacting?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.161
I'm sorry, man... you know,

00:27.195 --> 00:30.098
I want to go, but me and
the president, we got history.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.199
History?!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.666
Back when I worked in Chicago,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.568
Barry and I played
in a pickup game once.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.737
Words were exchanged,
elbows were flying,

00:36.770 --> 00:38.272
punches were thrown...

00:38.306 --> 00:40.608
bottom line is
I beat up a president.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.677
Word must've got around
because Iraq

00:43.711 --> 00:46.747
put me on their $300 bill.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.083
Great. Now I got to pick
somebody from my family.

00:49.117 --> 00:49.950
No matter who I choose,

00:49.983 --> 00:51.519
the other three
are gonna be mad at me.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.521
You don't know that.
Do some sniffing around first.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.589
All right?
One of 'em might hate politics.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.325
I mean, maybe the other ones
had plans.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.392
I know I do.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.395
I got 72 hours to squeeze
in mountain bike riding,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.531
skydiving, rock climbing
and a bunch of other stuff

01:03.564 --> 01:06.300
that guys like to do in erectile
dysfunction commercials.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.139
I hope you're right-- if I can't
eliminate some of these people,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.406
it's gonna get ugly.
Mm.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.374
You know my family.
Well...

01:13.407 --> 01:15.409
There's one piece of
pizza left and we'd...

01:15.443 --> 01:17.345
get into a big fight
and throw that piece of pizza

01:17.378 --> 01:20.348
on the ground and stomp on it
so nobody can have it.
(chuckles)

01:20.381 --> 01:23.384
Can't throw the president
on the ground and stomp on him.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.119
I did.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.181
Oh, Mom, don't worry about it.
We'll clean up.
Oh...!

01:53.214 --> 01:55.883
Well, not Adam-- his chronic
fingertip pain is back.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.886
Oh, please.
Chronic fingertip pain?

01:58.919 --> 02:01.889
It's okay, baby. We don't have
to change people's minds.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.890
NATHAN:
So...

02:02.923 --> 02:05.226
TGIF, huh?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.561
I mean, not now-- it's gonna be
Friday in three days

02:07.595 --> 02:10.431
but still-- anybody got
any fun unbreakable plans?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.499
No.
Nothing.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.367
You know what, I was looking
for something to do

02:13.401 --> 02:14.835
on Friday-- if you find
anything, let me know.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.938
Okay... um...

02:17.971 --> 02:20.608
anybody else
just bored, frustrated

02:20.641 --> 02:22.576
and/or fed up
with-with politics?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.245
I mean, man,
no, thank you.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.779
I'm fed up with politics.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.282
If I wanted to hear a bunch
of rich old men yelling

02:28.316 --> 02:31.885
at each other, I'd drive
through another golf course.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.322
Well, I got to say,
it's kind of refreshing to hear

02:34.355 --> 02:36.190
from somebody who doesn't want
to waste their time

02:36.224 --> 02:38.226
on all this politics nonsense.
Well, it is

02:38.259 --> 02:39.092
a waste of time.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.861
It's not like
an Average Joe like me

02:40.894 --> 02:43.797
could change anything,
unless you could somehow get

02:43.831 --> 02:45.399
in the same room
with the president.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.835
Now, that would be cool.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.837
Nathan, what is going on?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.206
You are so nervous
and distracted.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.874
You're like one
of those pill-popping teens

02:53.907 --> 02:55.443
in the "Just Say No"
commercials.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.646
Nathan?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.649
Did you say yes?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.252
Okay, fine.
My-my boss gave me...

03:04.285 --> 03:07.988
two tickets to this President
Obama dinner on Friday night.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.224
You're having dinner with Obama?

03:10.258 --> 03:12.260
What's he making?

03:12.293 --> 03:14.428
No, Dad, he's not making
dinner-- he's speaking.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.897
And I... I got a plus one, so...

03:16.930 --> 03:18.932
I got to pick one of you,
but I know that...

03:18.966 --> 03:21.602
whoever I pick, the rest of you
are gonna get mad at me.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.604
Nathan, stop. That's ridiculous.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.006
Nobody's gonna be upset
about who you choose.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.541
I mean, what kind of jerk

03:27.575 --> 03:29.777
would fault a son
for taking his mother?

03:29.810 --> 03:32.446
TOM:
Hold on a second.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.915
What makes you so sure
he's gonna pick you over me?

03:34.948 --> 03:36.384
Okay, f-for the record,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.552
I haven't picked anyone
to go with me yet.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.553
Oh, that's right.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.289
Uh, he hasn't picked anyone.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.725
DEBBIE:
Look, if it makes it

03:44.758 --> 03:47.828
any easier, Adam and I are
out because of the pact.

03:47.861 --> 03:48.662
The pact?

03:48.696 --> 03:49.863
Yeah... well, when
we were dating,

03:49.897 --> 03:52.533
we both made a vow that if one
of us couldn't do something,

03:52.566 --> 03:53.534
then the other
wouldn't either.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.902
No resentment.

03:54.935 --> 03:55.903
That's why I've never been
down the giant slide

03:55.936 --> 03:57.405
at the water park.
Adam's afraid of heights.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.407
Well, first of all,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.742
I am not afraid of heights.
I have vertigo,

04:01.775 --> 04:04.812
which is exacerbated
by wind and water...

04:06.046 --> 04:07.815
...and, secondly,
this is the president.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.950
Are you breaking the pact?

04:09.983 --> 04:12.353
I'm just saying that surely
some pact that I made

04:12.386 --> 04:14.555
while being airlifted off
the top of a dumb waterslide

04:14.588 --> 04:15.723
could be reconsidered.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.725
Okay, so there's no pact.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.660
So every time we go
to the water park,

04:19.693 --> 04:22.029
I've been floating around a lazy
river dodging empty juice boxes

04:22.062 --> 04:24.031
and old Band-Aids for nothing?

04:24.064 --> 04:27.301
Wait, I-I'm sorry-- Adam, why
did you have to be airlifted?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.470
Why didn't you just climb back
down the stairs?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.671
I have
a rare condition

04:30.704 --> 04:32.005
called panic paralysis.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.974
When I get nervous,
I can't move.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.909
Let's just say
I may have invented planking

04:35.943 --> 04:37.945
when I lost my virginity.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.319
Okay.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.955
Go ahead. Break the pact.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.057
But you just decided to
go up against the girl

04:50.090 --> 04:53.694
whose high school nickname
was Debbie Don't Lose.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.028
And you know why?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.697
Because Debbie...

04:56.730 --> 04:58.632
don't...

04:58.666 --> 05:00.300
lose.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.938
I'm in this game.
Look...

05:04.972 --> 05:06.474
I need to speak
to the president.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.676
Our states are
legalizing marijuana

05:08.709 --> 05:10.411
and our schools are
outlawing cursive.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.813
Somebody needs to get a
message to our young people:

05:12.846 --> 05:15.383
more working, less twerking.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.786
The president doesn't want
to hear your whining.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.522
I'd talk to him about normal
stuff, like when he goes down

05:21.555 --> 05:22.856
to the kitchen for
a midnight snack,

05:22.890 --> 05:24.658
does the Secret
Service go with him?

05:24.692 --> 05:26.527
And does he have to
put pants on?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.729
Dad, you're-you're
not speaking...
I need the president's ear

05:28.762 --> 05:30.063
for one minute
to talk

05:30.097 --> 05:31.499
about a tax credit
for vegans.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.034
(all talking at once)

05:34.067 --> 05:35.736
Nobody is speaking
to the president!

05:35.769 --> 05:38.872
It is a charity dinner--
that's it!

05:38.906 --> 05:41.008
We're all gonna get dressed up
just to sit in our car

05:41.041 --> 05:42.976
for two hours 'cause traffic's
gonna be mayhem.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.046
Then we're gonna have to just be
in the back of a huge ballroom,

05:46.079 --> 05:48.749
you know, in a seat that's
not even facing the stage.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.818
The best view
we'll have of the president

05:50.851 --> 05:51.919
is the reflection on our spoon.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.754
We're gonna be

05:53.787 --> 05:55.756
surrounded by a bunch
of rich, snobby people

05:55.789 --> 05:57.925
who are gonna be complaining
that the wine stinks.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.395
And it will because it's nothing
but a glorified airplane meal.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.897
I have half a mind just
to rip this thing up myself.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.833
Who even wants to go
to one of these?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.009
NATHAN:
Here's the deal:

06:16.043 --> 06:17.978
I've decided I don't
want to be the bad guy

06:18.011 --> 06:19.947
with this whole
presidential dinner,

06:19.980 --> 06:23.617
so I am leaving the decision
entirely up to you.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.954
Yeah. Power to the people.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.891
The petty, backstabbing people.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.193
What if we have a big huge fight
about it?
Not my problem...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.463
What if we can't choose someone?
Not my problem.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.164
When do you need
to have an answer?
Not my... Oh, no. That one is

06:37.197 --> 06:40.701
on me-- um, I'd say by tomorrow
afternoon at the latest.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.636
So, good luck hashing it out.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.572
Call me if it gets physical.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.608
I'd give anything to see
somebody take a swing at Mom.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.144
Well, you heard him.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.682
We need to figure out a way
to decide.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.818
So I guess first person
to touch the treadmill wins.

06:57.851 --> 06:58.852
I touched it. I win.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.654
Whoo!
What should I wear?

07:02.623 --> 07:05.493
Sorry, dear, but that is not
how we're gonna decide this.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.228
Whatever we do, it has
to be completely fair.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.698
I propose that we each make
a case for why we should go

07:10.731 --> 07:13.033
and then we'll vote and the
person with the most votes wins.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.502
Oh, that'd be
a great idea

07:14.535 --> 07:16.504
if this were the
United Nerds of America.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.807
Why don't we all just look
between our legs

07:19.840 --> 07:24.545
and whoever can say Nathan came
from there wins.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.947
I might have a shot
in that competition.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.148
Maybe I should
just take you.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.851
You're probably the only one
who can be an adult about this.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.721
Ooh, President Obama?
No, thanks.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.189
I'm a Republican.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.092
We're drawing names.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.161
Great. I don't need
to know how you got there.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.197
Just tell me when it's over.
Same thing I say to my waxer.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.800
Nathan, will you do
the honors?

07:46.834 --> 07:49.970
No, I will not.
Come on. Just pick
a piece of paper.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.705
No, I don't want to be
the target of your anger.

07:51.739 --> 07:52.973
Have Mikayla do it.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.242
No way!
I've got a birthday coming up,

07:55.275 --> 07:58.979
and my biggest donors are
in that bowl.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.614
You're just gonna
have to find somebody

08:00.648 --> 08:01.982
among yourselves
who you trust.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.755
NATHAN:
Ray, I'm sorry

08:07.788 --> 08:09.757
they pulled you out
of that Groupon karate class.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.224
I know you were
looking forward to...

08:11.258 --> 08:14.261
catching a fly with chopsticks.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.664
I actually misread the schedule.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.131
It was tai chi.
(exhales)

08:18.165 --> 08:20.834
Which will come in handy
if I'm ever attacked by a snail.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.072
Okay, Ray, pick a name.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.140
One last time,
I'm begging you to reconsider.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.943
Okay, shut up, Adam; we've made
our decision, just deal with it.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.646
And the winner is...
Anarchy, that's what's
winning out here.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.982
Anarchy, stupidity and...

08:35.015 --> 08:35.616
Adam.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.285
...awesomeness!
(chuckles)

08:38.318 --> 08:40.821
Winner, winner,
presidential dinner.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.025
Okay, you know what,
maybe Adam was right;

08:45.058 --> 08:46.126
maybe we should've voted.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.662
I-I agree. Perhaps we were
too quick to shoot down

08:48.696 --> 08:51.031
your wonderfully
democratic idea.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.032
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we already...
Yeah, we should do it

08:52.065 --> 08:53.033
Adam's way.
No, no, no.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.769
I'm going to the dinner.
Nathan, tell them I won.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.304
This can't come as a shock
to you.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.173
You know how this family changes
the rules to suit their needs.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.676
Pretty sure
we invented "Connect Five."

09:06.814 --> 09:08.982
Mom, let's go. We got to decide
who's gonna see the president

09:09.016 --> 09:10.751
before they have
another election.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.222
Good luck
on your presentation, Tom.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.990
I don't need luck.
I'm one of those guys

09:17.024 --> 09:20.360
who good stuff happens to
purely by chance.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.763
Uh, sorry I'm late.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.765
I tried to land
on your doorstep,

09:24.798 --> 09:27.200
but it's windy out there and my
shoe got caught in the oak tree.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.639
Not a bad adventure
for 22 bucks.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.840
You guys jeopardized
Ray's safety

09:32.873 --> 09:34.041
by dragging him into this?

09:34.074 --> 09:37.144
We needed him. In case of a tie,
Ray is our deciding vote.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.613
Sorry, man.
It's okay, man.

09:39.647 --> 09:43.083
It's interesting to see
how white families do crazy.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.118
Okay, we each have up
to a minute to make our case.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.054
Mom, why don't you go first.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.623
Okay. Ray, dim the lights.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.125
Mikayla,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.227
put the spot on me.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.133
("America the Beautiful"
playing)

10:00.167 --> 10:02.069
November 5, 1955.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.104
A cold mist fell.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.774
In the distance,
a bald eagle shrieked.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.009
(cawing)

10:09.042 --> 10:10.110
My little brother ran in,

10:10.143 --> 10:13.113
sweat taking over his face,
as he gave me the news.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.415
(high-pitched):
"Sis, President Eisenhower!

10:15.448 --> 10:17.217
He's driving through town!"

10:17.250 --> 10:18.852
I couldn't believe it.

10:18.886 --> 10:19.753
Our small town?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.388
We ran through the streets

10:21.421 --> 10:23.090
as fast as we could
to get there.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.158
Ike's coming!
Ike's coming!

10:25.192 --> 10:26.660
15 seconds!

10:26.694 --> 10:28.095
What?!
13.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.062
Okay, I'll-I'll skip the part

10:29.096 --> 10:30.931
where I get chased by a dog.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.431
Woof, woof.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.199
When we got there,

10:32.232 --> 10:34.134
the cars were
driving so fast

10:34.167 --> 10:36.436
that we could barely hear
a distant horn.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.237
Toot, toot.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.438
Time.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.940
(sighs)
I didn't get to meet him.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.141
50 years of regret.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.242
Please vote for me and...

10:42.275 --> 10:45.846
God bless America!

10:47.180 --> 10:48.916
Her time was up.
Disregard that last sentence.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.884
The confetti did not happen.
Dad, it's your turn.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.887
Ray, lights.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.889
A reason you should vote for me

10:55.923 --> 10:59.426
is that I'll ask the questions
we all want the answers to.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.729
"How many carry-ons
are you allowed

11:01.762 --> 11:03.731
to bring on Air Force One?"

11:05.165 --> 11:07.667
"What country
is your second favorite?"

11:08.902 --> 11:12.139
"Do you still get mail
for George Bush?"

11:12.172 --> 11:15.075
"How much is the electricity
bill at the White House?"

11:15.108 --> 11:17.444
"Is it included in the rent?"

11:17.477 --> 11:22.449
And, then, uh, I repeat that
for all the other utilities.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.351
Debbie, you're up.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.353
(clears her throat)

11:26.386 --> 11:28.989
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:29.022 --> 11:31.158
I would like to present to you
a combination

11:31.191 --> 11:32.993
of home video
and security footage

11:33.026 --> 11:35.228
from July 13, 2003.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.764
(helicopter whirring on video)

11:36.797 --> 11:38.465
Just promise
we won't do anything

11:38.498 --> 11:41.001
the other person can't
or doesn't want to do.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.736
No resentment. Promise.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.937
I promise!

11:43.971 --> 11:45.405
Okay, it's a pact.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.707
(helicopter whirring)

11:48.842 --> 11:50.844
Don't forget my shoes
in the cubby!

11:52.179 --> 11:53.981
(Debbie stops video,
clears her throat)

11:54.014 --> 11:58.418
And I didn't...
forget his shoes from the cubby.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.287
I rest my case.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.892
Well, Adam, I guess you're up.

12:04.925 --> 12:08.796
Okay. I refuse
to do this exercise in futility

12:08.829 --> 12:10.798
because I know
that even if I win,

12:10.831 --> 12:12.299
you'll just go back
on your words

12:12.332 --> 12:13.801
and change
the rules again.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.068
And since I know

12:15.102 --> 12:17.004
that none of you are gonna vote
for me, anyways,

12:17.037 --> 12:21.241
I'd like to use my time to argue
why you three should not go.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.845
Liar! Liar!

12:24.878 --> 12:26.880
Pants on fire.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.385
You may use
the remainder of my time

12:32.419 --> 12:34.788
to reflect on how
you've betrayed not only me,

12:34.822 --> 12:37.157
but the entire notion
of democracy. Thank you.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.162
Okay, we're good. Let's vote.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.258
I'll tally the votes.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.063
Adam.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.267
Adam.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.039
The majority vote, the person
going to see the president

13:26.073 --> 13:27.507
with me is...

13:27.540 --> 13:28.842
Adam.

13:28.876 --> 13:29.609
Yes!

13:29.642 --> 13:31.511
We all voted for Adam?

13:31.544 --> 13:33.180
No. I-I only voted for him,

13:33.213 --> 13:35.315
because I thought everybody
would vote for one of you two.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.950
Well, that's what
we all thought.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.486
I kind of liked
his presentation.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.388
Okay, fine, we'll revote.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.256
This time,
nobody vote for Adam.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.325
RAY:
Okay. If I may...

13:45.358 --> 13:47.995
(wind gusting)
I think...
Uh-oh. I got to go! Oh...!

13:51.598 --> 13:54.101
NATHAN: Okay, no,
there's no revote.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.335
The booths are closed.
You had your chance

13:55.368 --> 13:57.337
and you blew it;
now I'm stuck with Adam.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.505
You don't want me there.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.639
No, because I don't want

13:59.672 --> 14:02.042
to spend the entire night
listening to you complain

14:02.075 --> 14:04.144
about your sprained eyelids,
or your belly button fatigue,

14:04.177 --> 14:05.512
or ghost tongue syndrome.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.215
Yeah, GTS.
All right, you know what?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.383
Forget it.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.152
I don't even want
to go, all right?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.221
I'm not about to force
someone to have dinner with me.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.657
I had enough of that growing up
with an anorexic cat.

14:17.690 --> 14:22.395
You see, this is why I couldn't
trust you guys to handle this.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.498
Us? You're the one who should
have made the decision.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.667
Yeah, instead of making
us do your dirty work.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.169
Fine. You want me to choose?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.204
I'll choose. I'm taking Dad.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.940
Really?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.374
Thank you, son.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.376
Wait. Dad?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.211
You picked Dad?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.213
NATHAN: Yeah, of course
I'm taking him.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.016
Look at him. The man checks
the mailbox five times a day.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.517
He's got nobody to talk to.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.154
Telemarketers have him
on a do-not-call list.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.255
I mean,

14:48.288 --> 14:49.456
poor guy.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.992
I mean, he needs something
to spice up his miserable life.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.526
Miserable?!

14:53.560 --> 14:54.995
Screw you!

14:55.028 --> 14:56.463
And for your information,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.431
I'm the happiest I've ever been.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.632
Every day I wake up

14:59.666 --> 15:03.170
to the sweet sound
of not your mother.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.372
Keep your plus one.
I don't need your pity.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.207
Fine. You know what?
I thought that Debbie

15:07.240 --> 15:08.375
deserved to go, anyway.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.576
Deb, what do you think?

15:09.609 --> 15:10.577
You in?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.545
(sighs)
Thank you, Nathan.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.715
You know, I was hoping all
along that you would ask me...

15:15.748 --> 15:17.684
so I could say no.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.252
NATHAN:
Wait. Now you're
not going?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.154
I was never going.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.490
See, I made a pact
with my husband,

15:23.523 --> 15:25.092
and I plan on keeping it.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.727
Really? You would turn down
the president for me?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.162
Of course I would.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.697
I love you.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.535
Almost as much as
I'm gonna love

15:35.568 --> 15:39.072
holding this over your head
for the next 30 years.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.608
My other high school nickname--
Debbie Don't Drop It.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.521
So...

15:54.554 --> 15:57.557
Last?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.059
Mom, don't give me...

15:59.092 --> 16:00.260
You picked me last.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.295
Well, look, just...

16:02.329 --> 16:03.096
Last?

16:03.130 --> 16:04.531
Mom, do you want
the ticket or not?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.166
(yelling):
Last?!

16:07.800 --> 16:10.370
Fine. I'll just go by myself.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.505
All I wanted to do was
make everybody happy,

16:12.539 --> 16:14.341
but that is impossible,

16:14.374 --> 16:16.309
'cause you people
can't be happy

16:16.343 --> 16:17.477
until somebody is miserable.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.745
Well, now I'm miserable.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.014
And that makes you happy.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.250
And-and then that
makes me happy.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.752
But my happiness makes
you miserable again.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.654
And the cycle
repeats itself.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.357
And that's how white
families do crazy.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.572
Nathan Miller.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.108
Okay. Here you are,
but we can't let you enter

16:48.141 --> 16:50.043
until all members
of your party are present.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.544
Oh, it's-it's just me.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.480
But we have you down
for a plus one.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.615
Yeah, but the thing is,
everybody refused to go with me

16:55.648 --> 16:56.516
'cause they thought I was crazy.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.352
Why did they think
you were crazy, sir?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.254
Oh, just 'cause my plan.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.226
You had a plan... sir?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.360
Oh, I had a great plan.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.596
I was gonna have my family
do the dirty work for me,

17:09.629 --> 17:11.798
and they all insisted
that I pull the trigger.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.167
Sir, do you want to
come with me, please?
What's that? No.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.436
There's been some kind
of misunderstanding here.
Sir.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.705
I can't believe how much the
government knows about people.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.607
I mean, I get
that you might know

17:20.640 --> 17:21.641
about what schools I went to,

17:21.674 --> 17:23.343
but the fact that you know

17:23.376 --> 17:25.412
that my first kiss was with
Julie Porter-- that's amazing.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.647
Your first kiss was with your
sister's Raggedy Ann doll.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.282
Julie was your
first human kiss.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.151
Are there cameras in...?
Everywhere.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.286
Even in the...?
Everywhere.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.389
I'm sorry. I'm a little
turned around down here.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.624
Which was is it
back to the dinner?

17:37.657 --> 17:38.858
Just head straight
down the corridor,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.527
take a left past
the bathroom.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.594
You'll find a
service elevator.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.430
Take that to the
mezzanine. Yup.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.632
Roger that.
POTUS is on the move.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.434
I'll secure
the building.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.569
Okay, and can I just
use that bath...?

17:49.602 --> 17:51.371
Forget it.
I'll figure it out.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.241
For the record,
I rocked Julie Porter's world,

17:54.274 --> 17:56.276
and she's got Raggedy Ann
to thank for that.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.886
(knocking)

18:06.919 --> 18:08.688
AGENT: Sir, I'm gonna
need to ask you

18:08.721 --> 18:10.690
to finish what you're
doing in there and exit.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.592
It's a matter of
national importance.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.760
I just got in here.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.196
You again?!

18:16.229 --> 18:17.830
I thought I told you to
go up to the ballroom.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.199
Sorry. I've been drinking water
all day.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.467
I don't want my face to be puffy

18:20.500 --> 18:21.668
in case I took a picture
with the president.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.371
PRESIDENT OBAMA:
Problem in here, Mike?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.906
AGENT: No, sir. Just
trying to remove

18:26.939 --> 18:29.409
an individual from
the stall, sir.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.310
Well, don't rush the man.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.311
Take your time, sir.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.679
I can wait.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.747
Thank you, sir.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.849
So, how are you doing tonight?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.652
Me? Uh... uh, you know.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.655
The same old, same old.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.626
Just making small talk with
the leader of the free world.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.328
Guess you're gonna
have an exciting story

18:48.361 --> 18:49.762
to tell your date.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.298
Oh, uh, it's just me.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.666
I-I couldn't get anybody
to come with me tonight.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.670
Really? Well, I'll have to look
at my poll numbers again.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.773
Oh, no, no, no.
It was my family.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.842
I was just try... I was trying
to make everybody happy,

19:02.875 --> 19:04.744
and I ended up
pissing everybody off.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.247
Welcome to
my world.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.881
Are you about done?

19:08.915 --> 19:11.318
He's being nice,
but you're pushing it.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.519
PRESIDENT OBAMA:
Don't peek at the man, Mike.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.520
We're getting flack

19:13.553 --> 19:14.587
for spying too
much as it is.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.856
That's funny.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.858
You know,
if there's one thing

19:18.891 --> 19:20.660
I've learned since
taking office,

19:20.693 --> 19:22.562
it's that you can't
make everybody happy.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.832
From healthcare to which
hip-hop artist you befriend.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.501
Oh. Yeah, you're right, sir.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.803
It's impossible
to make everybody happy.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.573
And you know what?
I'm done trying.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.741
Hold on.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
Just because you can't
make someone happy

19:36.709 --> 19:37.744
doesn't mean you
shouldn't try.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.780
Trying to achieve the
impossible-- that's America.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.815
It's why we're great.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.751
Oh, that's good.
Mike, write that down.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.753
I'm gonna
say that tonight.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.588
Thank you, Mr. President.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.590
Any time.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.691
So, uh, are we close,

19:51.724 --> 19:53.860
or do I need to draw up
an exit strategy for you?

19:53.893 --> 19:56.296
Oh. Uh, no, no, no.
Yeah, I'm good.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.697
Actually, sir,

19:57.730 --> 20:00.333
do you mind doing me
one more favor?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.770
What is this?
Toilet paper?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.938
Mom, when you're in a
bathroom, you make do.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.207
Just read it.
I think you'll like it.

20:09.376 --> 20:13.680
"Dear Carol,
as you can see,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.849
I'm also a fan
of cursive."

20:18.585 --> 20:20.653
"Love, Barack Obama."

20:20.687 --> 20:22.389
(giggles)

20:22.422 --> 20:23.956
"Debbie, your brother told me

20:23.990 --> 20:27.460
"how you honored your pact
with your husband.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.297
I wish the North Koreans
had your integrity."

20:32.665 --> 20:34.501
"Adam, we all
have fears.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.403
Get your butt down
a water slide."

20:38.305 --> 20:43.310
"Tom, the electric bill
for the White House is about..."

20:43.343 --> 20:44.477
(sneezes)

20:45.645 --> 20:48.315
Oh, damn it.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.316
"Barack Obama."

20:49.349 --> 20:49.416
