Alex, can I interrupt...

16:33.282 --> 16:35.415
whatever it is that's going on here?

16:35.517 --> 16:38.318
Joya, I'm really not in the mood
to be insulted right now.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.486
Okay.

16:39.555 --> 16:42.644
Look, I know that I have
given you a hard time

16:42.691 --> 16:44.144
about starting this company.

16:44.235 --> 16:46.246
I also know, more than most,

16:46.293 --> 16:48.027
that it takes a lot of courage

16:48.090 --> 16:49.230
to leave what you know behind

16:49.277 --> 16:51.431
in order to give yourself
and your family a better life.

16:52.235 --> 16:53.334
Thank you.

16:54.627 --> 16:57.103
I gotta say, it's a lot harder
than I thought.

16:57.172 --> 16:59.606
I know Rooni told you she was worried,

16:59.708 --> 17:01.741
but I have to be honest.

17:02.281 --> 17:03.580
I'm worried, too.

17:03.642 --> 17:05.712
I have everything on the line.

17:07.015 --> 17:09.015
I'm going to tell you a story.

17:09.188 --> 17:12.182
So, get your giant microphone
out of your manny-pac.

17:12.268 --> 17:13.627
- It's going to be a good one.
- Really?

17:13.722 --> 17:15.622
That's great.
You know, the sound out here...

17:15.723 --> 17:16.890
The sound is fine.

17:19.428 --> 17:21.461
When I was a little girl in Calcutta,

17:21.530 --> 17:23.973
my grandfather treated me differently

17:24.035 --> 17:25.498
than he treated all of the sisters

17:25.567 --> 17:26.833
and the girl-cousins.

17:26.902 --> 17:28.869
He treated me, for some reason,

17:28.971 --> 17:30.203
like one of the boys.

17:30.272 --> 17:32.706
He would send me, all by myself,

17:32.774 --> 17:34.941
to the market to get potatoes

17:35.043 --> 17:37.377
or hilsa... the king of the fish...

17:37.446 --> 17:39.579
when I was no older than Soraya.

17:39.681 --> 17:41.848
That's so young.
You must have been terrified.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.417
I was. And I told my dadu.

17:44.519 --> 17:47.153
And he sat me down, and he said,

17:47.222 --> 17:50.657
"You don't even know
what you are afraid of.

17:50.759 --> 17:53.405
You must never fear <i> ajana,"</i>

17:53.467 --> 17:56.129
which in Bengali means "the unknown."

17:56.198 --> 17:58.965
"Because," he went on to say,

17:59.034 --> 18:02.936
<i>"ajana</i> is where
all the good things happen."

18:03.038 --> 18:06.339
I never forgot that.

18:06.408 --> 18:09.142
And even now,
every time that I'm afraid,

18:09.211 --> 18:11.478
I see that little 7-year-old girl

18:11.580 --> 18:13.280
throwing her shoulders back

18:13.382 --> 18:16.965
and marching into
that crowded market in Calcutta.

18:18.426 --> 18:19.505
