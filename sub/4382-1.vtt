<i>"Oh, America"</i>

00:25.545 --> 00:28.115
<i>I wish i could tell you that
this was still America.</i>

00:28.598 --> 00:31.899
<i>But I've come to realise that
you can't have a country without people.</i>

00:33.359 --> 00:35.294
<i>And there are no people here</i>

00:52.550 --> 00:57.028
<i>No my friends... this is now
"The United States Of Zombieland"</i>

01:00.736 --> 01:05.001
<i>It's amazing how quickly thing can go from
'bad' to 'total shit-storm'.</i>

01:05.906 --> 01:09.016
<i>And why am I alive,
when everyone around me had turned to meat?</i>

01:09.524 --> 01:11.483
<i>It's because of my list of rules.</i>

01:12.188 --> 01:15.669
<i>Rule#1 for survival in Zombieland...
is "Cardio".</i>

01:17.700 --> 01:23.236
<i>When the virus struck, for obvious reasons,
the first one to go were the fatties.</i>

01:27.174 --> 01:29.004
<i>Poor fat bastard!</i>

01:30.493 --> 01:33.275
<i>As the infection spread
and chaos grew...</i>

01:33.333 --> 01:35.721
<i>It wasn't enough
just being fast on your feet</i>

01:36.938 --> 01:39.417
<i>You'd have to get a gun
and learn how to use it.</i>

01:39.891 --> 01:43.069
<i>Which leads me to my second rule
"The Double Tag"</i>

01:44.787 --> 01:48.111
<i>In those moments when you're not sure
that the 'undead' are really dead-ed</i>

01:48.566 --> 01:52.801
<i>Don't get off stingy with your bullets.
I mean one more clean shot to the head.</i>

01:55.065 --> 01:57.829
<i>And this lady could have avoided
becoming a human happy-meal.</i>

01:58.968 --> 02:01.325
<i>Woulda? Coulda?
Shoulda?</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:04.089
<i>It wasn't long before
the zombies began to get clever.</i>

02:04.543 --> 02:07.768
<i>When you are at your most vulnerable,
somehow they could just smell it.</i>

02:17.054 --> 02:18.352
<i>Don't let them catch you
with your pants down.</i>

02:18.353 --> 02:20.732
<i>Rule #3 "Beware of Bathrooms"</i>

02:23.005 --> 02:25.223
<i>As zombie began to outnumber humans</i>

02:25.652 --> 02:28.217
<i>That's when you have
to cut all emotional ties</i>

02:28.530 --> 02:31.820
<i>If the girls in your neigborhood are now
fucked up little monsters,</i>

02:33.479 --> 02:35.808
<i>Oh, maybe it's time to stop
driving car pools.</i>

02:41.425 --> 02:45.004
<i>You have to focus, on your own survival,
which leads to Rule#4</i>

02:45.817 --> 02:47.107
<i>Pretty basic.</i>

02:54.111 --> 02:55.998
<i>"Fasten your seatbelts"</i>

02:56.032 --> 02:57.753
<i>It's gonna be a bumpy ride.</i>

04:40.255 --> 04:42.214
<i>That guy down there, is me.</i>

04:42.993 --> 04:47.502
<i>I'm in Garland, Texas. That may look like
zombies destroyed it, but that's actually Garland.</i>

04:52.069 --> 04:56.041
<i>Just 2 months and I might be
the last non-cannibal freak in the country.</i>

04:56.501 --> 05:01.280
<i>I may seem like an unlikely survivor
with all my phobias and irritable bowel syndrom.</i>

05:01.665 --> 05:05.244
<i>but I had the advantage of never having
any friends or close family.</i>

05:06.143 --> 05:09.554
<i>I survived because
I played it safe and follow the rules...</i>

05:10.112 --> 05:11.374
<i>My rules.</i>

05:28.657 --> 05:30.262
<i>"Rule #1: Cardio"</i>

05:39.693 --> 05:40.440
Shit.

05:47.575 --> 05:49.884
<i>"Rule #1: Cardio"</i>

05:53.692 --> 05:54.844
Of course.

06:17.227 --> 06:19.874
<i>"Rule #4: Seatbelts"</i>

06:21.666 --> 06:22.559
Motherfucker.

06:41.461 --> 06:43.612
<i>"Rule #2: Double Tap"</i>

06:47.099 --> 06:50.381
<i>On the bright side,
I did find the place to go number 2</i>

06:55.231 --> 06:58.179
<i>Another rule to surviving Zombieland:
'Travel light'</i>

06:58.694 --> 07:00.531
<i>And I don't mean just luggage.</i>

07:00.822 --> 07:06.710
<i>I've always been kind of a loner, I avoided other people
like they were zombies; even before they were zombies.</i>

07:06.781 --> 07:10.287
<i>Now that they are all zombies,
I kinda miss people.
</i>

07:10.685 --> 07:15.277
<i>So I'm on my way from my college dorm
in Austin, Texas to Columbus, Ohio.</i>

07:15.459 --> 07:17.549
<i>Where, Im hoping my parents
are still alive.</i>

07:17.834 --> 07:21.808
<i>Eventhough, we were never really close,
just be nice to see a familiar face.</i>

07:21.809 --> 07:25.928
<i>Or any face that doesn't have blood dripping
from it's lips and flesh between its teeth.</i>

08:51.590 --> 08:52.869
Thank you.

08:59.132 --> 09:01.229
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing, I just uh...

09:01.580 --> 09:02.548
I had this list.

09:02.887 --> 09:04.941
No one back there but
my duffel bag.

09:08.874 --> 09:09.835
What's your name?

09:10.068 --> 09:13.755
Stop, no names. Keeps us
from getting too familiar.

09:15.475 --> 09:18.145
You almost knocked off
your alcohol with your knife.

09:18.856 --> 09:20.780
- That's okay, you don't have to...
- No.

09:21.081 --> 09:24.379
- Where are you headed?
- Columbus.

09:24.702 --> 09:25.639
You?

09:26.838 --> 09:28.200
Tallahassee.

09:31.712 --> 09:34.754
- More?
- Uh, no, one for me, one and done.

09:37.117 --> 09:41.918
You know, Tallahassee and
Columbus are, both uh...east.

09:41.919 --> 09:46.962
- So? - So, Tallahassee,
you wanna stick together? At least for a while

09:47.798 --> 09:52.792
Here's the deal, Columbus...huh
Im not easy to get along with

09:52.793 --> 09:56.321
and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch

09:57.226 --> 10:02.289
- I'll get this relationship to about uh, Texarkana.
- Really? Yeah. You'll take me as far as Texarkana.

10:03.222 --> 10:05.415
You're a pappy little spit fuck
aren't you?

10:06.591 --> 10:12.226
- You  might wanna buckle up, you know for safety.
- I can tell already, you are getting on my nerve.

10:13.901 --> 10:15.864
<i>Even though teaming up
wasn't my style.</i>

10:16.052 --> 10:18.326
<i>I figure, I'll be safer
with Tallahassee.</i>

10:18.327 --> 10:22.319
<i>You see he was in the ass kicking business, and
- Bussiness is Good.</i>

10:23.430 --> 10:27.366
<i>It became quickly apparent that
he did have one weaknesss.</i>

10:28.165 --> 10:31.728
- What are we doing here?
- Take a look. It's a goddamn 'Hostess' truck.

10:31.855 --> 10:34.503
Yeah, I see that
a Hostess truck. So what?

10:35.126 --> 10:37.409
I could use a Twinkie.

10:42.523 --> 10:45.943
- You coming?
- Uh yes, yeah, one second

10:50.608 --> 10:52.885
- Are you fucking with me?
- No.

10:53.223 --> 10:59.174
You should actually, limber up as well especially,
if you're going down that hill its very important.

10:59.996 --> 11:05.650
I don't believe in it. You ever seen a
lion limber up before taking down a gazelle?

11:28.869 --> 11:32.140
- Sno-balls..?
- Yeah. Sno-balls?

11:33.369 --> 11:37.837
- Where's the fucking Twinkies?
- I like Sno-balls.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.900
I hate coconut.
Not the taste, the consistency.

11:46.019 --> 11:48.178
Oh, this Twinkie thing
it ain't over yet.

11:51.957 --> 11:56.384
This may be a bad time, but,
I just ate the brown sugar Snowballs.

11:56.706 --> 11:58.405
- Really?
- Really.

12:04.874 --> 12:07.747
<i>I know. Again?
So soon? What can I say.</i>

12:08.016 --> 12:10.394
<i>I have a case of cronic anxiety.</i>

12:13.646 --> 12:16.120
<i>It is.. I've always been kind of
phobic</i>

12:16.282 --> 12:18.469
<i>I find lots of things disturbing.</i>

12:18.764 --> 12:23.883
<i>Like undertoe, or department store centers,
being alone with a baby.</i>

12:25.865 --> 12:29.228
<i>But the thing I fear more than anything,
yes, even more than zombies.</i>

12:31.200 --> 12:32.592
<i>Fucking clowns.</i>

12:35.392 --> 12:39.640
<i>When you're afraid of everything that's out there,
You quit going out there.</i>

12:40.357 --> 12:42.653
<i>Which is what happened to me
before Zombieland.</i>

12:43.272 --> 12:46.398
<i>Friday night.
Third straight week indoors.</i>

12:46.702 --> 12:48.155
<i>World of Warcraft.</i>

12:48.601 --> 12:52.743
<i>Leaning tower of pizza boxes.
Code red Mountain Dew.</i>

12:53.275 --> 12:54.761
<i>Pride?
No where.</i>

12:55.287 --> 12:57.052
<i>Dignity?
Long gone.</i>

12:57.087 --> 12:59.969
<i>Virginity?
Totally justifyable to speculate on.</i>

13:01.076 --> 13:04.053
<i>My whole life,
All I ever wanted was to find a girl.</i>

13:04.545 --> 13:07.509
<i>And fall in love,
bring her home to meet the folks.</i>

13:07.839 --> 13:11.064
<i>Then again, since my folks are a couple
of paranoid shut ins like me</i>

13:11.066 --> 13:13.331
<i>Maybe this girl could bring me
home to her folks.</i>

13:13.554 --> 13:16.676
<i>And then, I'll finally be a member of
a cool functional family.</i>

13:19.965 --> 13:22.575
Please, is anyone home?
Please, its an emergency.

13:23.137 --> 13:25.852
<i>I don't usually unlock my door
to the sounds of panic,</i>

13:25.854 --> 13:28.285
<i>...but my neighbour 406
is insanely hot.</i>

13:32.978 --> 13:35.540
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

13:37.092 --> 13:38.275
Nice to meet you.

13:51.441 --> 13:53.737
- Mountain Dew?
- Yeah, Code Red.

13:53.955 --> 13:55.650
And here's some Gold Grams.

13:55.652 --> 13:57.592
The zip lock bags keep them crisp.

13:57.952 --> 13:59.098
Okay.

14:01.996 --> 14:08.796
- Tell me, what happened?
- He was homeless and sick...

14:08.797 --> 14:11.329
And i was walking home from the bar
talking on the phone.

14:11.331 --> 14:15.359
And then, he just came, sprinting towards me.

14:15.758 --> 14:19.111
I mean, not, not running,
'sprinting'.

14:20.055 --> 14:27.382
I thought you know he was, like maybe
he was running from someone

14:27.417 --> 14:27.741
or after them...the last time I saw
he was out there going crazy.

14:27.839 --> 14:30.405
- Drunks maybe?
- No.

14:31.231 --> 14:33.481
- I didn't even told you the worst part.

14:34.518 --> 14:37.721
- Yeah?
- He tried to bite me.

14:39.988 --> 14:45.190
- You are right, that's the worst part.
- Sorry, I was just so scared.

14:45.828 --> 14:49.429
No no no, you should be scared
the homeless guys just tried to eat you.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.047
That's like the right kind of scare,
that's a reasonable scare.

14:52.047 --> 14:54.418
You know, I get scared for things
that don't make sense at all, like...

14:54.418 --> 14:58.121
Clowns, with red noses, or like
the rag that use to wipe on table.

14:58.121 --> 15:00.796
when you finishes eating,
like a.. chain restaurant.

15:00.831 --> 15:05.204
- Really?
- Look, the point is I'm here for you, okay?

15:05.811 --> 15:08.681
And as long as you're by my side,
I'm not leaving this apartment.

15:09.531 --> 15:12.043
Do you mind if I just
close my eyes for a minute?

15:12.113 --> 15:14.827
- No, of course, of course.
- Thank you.

15:17.275 --> 15:20.946
<i>Set aside the feverish homeless cannibal
I'm living in the dream.</i>

15:21.743 --> 15:26.324
I've had always my whole life
wanted to brush a girl's hair over her ear.

15:27.822 --> 15:29.262
Goodnight.

15:44.731 --> 15:45.898
Oh my god.

15:46.721 --> 15:47.693
Are you okay?

15:53.192 --> 15:55.665
Okay okay okay.
Stop stop stop.

15:55.857 --> 15:56.872
What're you doing?

16:03.883 --> 16:07.173
Look, stay back 406, okay?
I dont wanna hurt you, but..

16:07.174 --> 16:08.134
Shit.

16:20.190 --> 16:22.075
Oh my god.
I'm so fucking sorry.

16:59.329 --> 17:01.471
You see, you just can't trust anyone.

17:01.956 --> 17:05.006
<i>The first girl I let into my life
and she tries to eat me.</i>

17:20.372 --> 17:23.420
Listen to me, 406.

17:24.617 --> 17:30.274
If you're in there..
You're just sick, okay?

17:42.472 --> 17:44.330
<i>"Rule #2: Double Tap"</i>

17:45.752 --> 17:48.796
<i>That was my first brush,
with the plaque of the 21st century.</i>

17:49.421 --> 17:54.111
<i>Remember mad cow disease? Well 'Mad cow'
became 'mad person' became 'mad zombie'.</i>

17:54.456 --> 18:00.113

brain, raging fever and make you hateful, violent.</i>

18:00.490 --> 18:03.235

18:03.236 --> 18:05.482
Alright, you steer, I'll push.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.484
Okay.

18:12.852 --> 18:16.806
- I've heard there's a place untouched by all this crap?
- Back east, yeah.

18:16.807 --> 18:18.282
Yeah, you heard the same thing?

18:18.842 --> 18:22.704
Out west we hear, back east..back east
hear it's here out west.

18:22.737 --> 18:25.234
And it's all just nonsense.

18:25.820 --> 18:31.165
You know, you're like a penguin on the north pole,
hear the south pole is really nice this time of year.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.679
There are no penguins
on the north pole.

18:35.374 --> 18:37.570
You wanna feel how hard
I can punch?

18:39.821 --> 18:42.936
- So, what do you think?
- You mean, the last time I laid some pipe?

18:44.017 --> 18:47.776
The last time you went 22's?
The percy in the playpen..

18:47.776 --> 18:50.815
- It's personal.
- Wallpapered the closet, passed the gravy.

18:50.817 --> 18:53.708
- Went heels to Jesus.
- Oh, make loves.

18:53.709 --> 18:56.183
Well, it's just, sex.

18:56.183 --> 19:02.448
Uhm.. Three weeks ago, yeah.
In the back of an abandoned FedEx truck.

19:03.189 --> 19:06.833
- Shut, up.
- No, no, I was headed east..

19:06.834 --> 19:08.790
She uh, west.

19:09.291 --> 19:13.302
And we took shelter in the back of the truck.
It was full of undelivered packages.

19:13.302 --> 19:14.972
What was her name?

19:15.007 --> 19:15.893
Beverly.

19:16.271 --> 19:18.867
- Beverly Hills.
- You dog.

19:21.679 --> 19:24.697
- So uh, what about you?
- Me?

19:24.697 --> 19:29.345
I... I... Ai yai yai.

19:32.377 --> 19:34.827
Oh my god.
That's extra sick.

19:35.407 --> 19:39.645
It'll makes you sad, it makes you..
makes you think you could go back

19:39.647 --> 19:42.593
To the way things were right now,
you know, you'd be...

19:42.593 --> 19:46.554
You'd be out in the backyard,
you know, trying to catch a fireflies.

19:47.315 --> 19:48.393
...and instead of this.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.688
- I mean it makes you...
- Hungry.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.931
- I'm worried about you.

19:55.931 --> 19:59.618
- Look, whatever you have waitin' for
you in Columbus, I'll promise you

19:59.618 --> 20:03.460
It ain't be any pretty than our
friend here enjoying her man-which.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.204
<i>Tallahassee had a sixth sense of humour
when it came to zombies.</i>

20:13.649 --> 20:17.123
<i>Zombies aren't the most loveable creature
but he really hated them.</i>

20:17.365 --> 20:21.352
<i>In fact the only thing he was more obsessed
to than killing a zombie was finding a Twinkie.</i>

20:21.676 --> 20:24.800
<i>Something about the Twinkie reminded
him about, time not so long ago.</i>

20:25.081 --> 20:28.011
<i>When things were simple
and not so fucking psychotic.</i>

20:28.874 --> 20:31.934
<i>It was like if he got a taste of
that comforting childhood treat,</i>

20:31.934 --> 20:35.477
<i>the world would become innocent again
and everything would return to normall.</i>

20:35.964 --> 20:37.547
Pretty prospecting.

20:38.593 --> 20:42.033
Jesus christ.
You're a dangerous man.

20:43.095 --> 20:45.565
You're gonna risk our lives
for a Twinkie?

20:46.126 --> 20:48.851
There's a boxes of Twinkies
in that grocery store.

20:49.297 --> 20:50.966
Not just any box of Twinkie.

20:50.989 --> 20:55.845
The last box of Twinkie that anyone
will enjoy in the whole universe.

20:56.073 --> 20:59.013
Believe it or not,
Twinkie have an expiration day.

20:59.290 --> 21:05.929
Someday very soon, life's little
Twinkle gauge is gonna go empty.

21:06.392 --> 21:08.536
Time to nut up or shut up!

21:11.067 --> 21:15.732

<i>What can I say, it's like,
it's like art.</i>

21:39.279 --> 21:40.892
You got a purdy mouth!

21:51.336 --> 21:52.243
Don't swing,
don't swing.

21:52.805 --> 21:53.672
Swing.

21:59.202 --> 22:01.372
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

22:04.848 --> 22:06.668
- You're great one.
- I know.

22:07.706 --> 22:09.841
Twinkie, Twinkie,
Twinkie, Twinkie.

22:11.715 --> 22:13.053
Oh, big hoss.

22:19.478 --> 22:22.116
Come here big fella,
just gonna take a little off the top.

22:30.053 --> 22:34.086
- Wow, these fellas really let themselves go.
- And they're so fat.

22:34.622 --> 22:36.618
Uh, I think we should
probably just keep going.

22:39.921 --> 22:42.542
<i>All I could think of was
"What are the odds?".</i>

22:42.795 --> 22:45.482
<i>Another marriageable women to
bring home to the folks.</i>

22:46.496 --> 22:47.287
Come quick.

22:48.472 --> 22:51.330
<i>Someone's ear is in danger
of having hair brushed over it.</i>

22:55.716 --> 22:56.822
I'll catch up later.

They're sisters. The little one's been bit.
Act normal, try not to freak her out.

23:20.481 --> 23:23.364
Colombus.
Wichita, Little Rock.

23:26.169 --> 23:29.474
- So, you did all this for a Twinkie?
- Oh, no no no no, he did.

23:29.474 --> 23:32.814
I'm just kind of like a
Sancho Panza character.

23:35.528 --> 23:39.107
- Um, I don't think she has long to live.
- I know, so does she.

23:39.109 --> 23:40.717
We're just looking for a way out.

23:42.201 --> 23:46.560
- No no no no, she's still a little girl.
- Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

23:46.818 --> 23:53.199
Alright, I'm sorry. Look, I know,
you know that you're really sick.

23:54.799 --> 23:58.177
- But uh, your sister wants me to..
- It's not her decision

23:58.179 --> 23:59.423
It's mine.

23:59.819 --> 24:01.238
I made a promise.

24:03.289 --> 24:05.999
We already said goodbye,
but we didn't have a gun.

24:06.509 --> 24:08.004
Oh look, we don't know
that there's definitely no cure right?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.628
You're just gut-less.

24:10.351 --> 24:11.812
Give him the gun.

24:27.889 --> 24:29.985
Wait, wait.

24:33.474 --> 24:34.396
I'll do it.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.038
- I love you.
- I love you too.

25:03.896 --> 25:05.392
You need some help?

25:05.547 --> 25:07.014
Now that you mention it.

25:07.529 --> 25:10.391
We'll take your weapons, your car key,
your ammunitions.

25:10.393 --> 25:11.996
And if you got it,
sugarless gum.

25:12.517 --> 25:13.657
What the fuck.

25:15.159 --> 25:16.827
Wa.. Wait, why are
you guys doing it?

25:17.036 --> 25:21.424
Well, better you make the mistake of trusting us,
than we make the mistake of trusting you.

25:24.363 --> 25:29.276
Of course the first hot girl in a thousand miles shows up,
makes me feels like an idiot, steals my double barrow

25:29.310 --> 25:31.693
and says I'm the one that can't be trusted.

25:36.347 --> 25:39.544
Nice going genius.
You're the one that gave her the gun.

25:40.165 --> 25:41.973
Those guys were dumb.

25:44.119 --> 25:48.985
- Avoid the vanity mirror.
- Relax ok, I just passed for a zombie.

25:50.447 --> 25:55.073
- What I'd give for a show...
- Do not say the S-H-O-W-E-R, okay?

25:55.108 --> 25:56.533
Just get the rule going.

25:57.232 --> 25:59.682
- So, do you think it's true?
- Is what true?

26:00.035 --> 26:03.378
- Rumors about Pacific Playland.
- Totally zombie-free. Only places way to go.

26:07.368 --> 26:08.611
Trust me.

26:11.501 --> 26:16.639
So he's on one of the serious Tour 'de France
bikes, you know with the, like the toeholds, right

26:16.639 --> 26:20.779
And uh, he's peddling. And the zombies
head is like caught in the gear.

26:21.766 --> 26:24.768
You know with the hair and the
chain just like, going around.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.227
Very cool.

26:26.228 --> 26:27.826
- Yeah.
- But..

26:28.433 --> 26:31.553
Zombie-kill of the week.. no sir.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.937
I saw this construction worker
I shit you not.

26:35.775 --> 26:39.710
He's on the steam roller and the
zombie goes down in front of me..

26:39.710 --> 26:41.659
Ever roll a tube of tooth paste
up from the bottom?

26:41.659 --> 26:45.997
- Yeah. I always rolled up from bottom to top.
- Yeah, zombie's head is the cap.

26:46.008 --> 26:48.866
Do you know this guy who's trying
to like.. to be in everyone's story?

26:49.625 --> 26:53.217
No. I knew who got away
worse than that to me.

26:53.861 --> 26:57.575
- I just try to find their car.
- Which would remind me..

26:57.575 --> 27:00.377
I never had headaches like this
'til your ass came on board.

27:00.377 --> 27:04.201
Do what you want with a man,
but do not fuck with his Cadillac.

27:04.369 --> 27:07.678
- Hey, this is a nice mini-van.
- Yes, it is nice.

27:08.516 --> 27:10.135
That's a beautiful van.

27:11.694 --> 27:15.335
Tallahassee firmly believe that you have
to blow off steam in Zombieland

27:15.335 --> 27:17.990
...or else you'll lose what's left of your mind.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.569
Well, if it makes him happy and keeps
him from using that crowbar on me,

27:21.330 --> 27:23.047
Then I say "Hey, go waste shit".

27:23.436 --> 27:25.945
I want my Caddy back.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.662
Stupid little bitches.

27:35.945 --> 27:38.170
Oh, I think I pulled something.

27:39.865 --> 27:43.387
You think there's two of us smart enough
to come home with a car like that?

27:46.775 --> 27:48.528
You hesitated.

27:50.299 --> 27:54.429
Would you rather be
smart or lucky?

27:55.511 --> 27:57.356
Look at what we got here.

28:25.140 --> 28:26.998
- It's nice.
- Small finger.

28:37.197 --> 28:39.336

This is a really big truck,
and these are really big gun.

28:47.190 --> 28:48.386
Take your time.

29:11.793 --> 29:15.933
You know they say "He who seeks revenge
should remember to dig two graves".

29:15.933 --> 29:17.499
Alright, two graves.

29:17.499 --> 29:20.010
One for the big chick,
one for the little chick.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.795
You're scary happy.

29:24.350 --> 29:27.023
Come on, why don't we just forget
about those girls and head home.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.619
So you want to talk about home?

29:30.681 --> 29:34.474
To me home was a,
puppy name Buck.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.056
Cutest dog ever.

29:44.891 --> 29:46.658
Cause of those fucking zombies...

29:47.979 --> 29:49.252
I lost him.

29:49.768 --> 29:52.142
There ain't no getting him back, so uh...

29:52.939 --> 29:54.743
I'm looking for a new home.

29:55.857 --> 30:00.650
Tomorrow maybe, skinny dip
in a Yellowstone River.

30:00.904 --> 30:04.553
Swinging from the chandeliers
in a Playboy mansion, but today,

30:04.569 --> 30:11.621
A Vortec 6 fucking litre V8. A box
full of hollow points and a Lord willin' and GD Twinkie.

30:13.232 --> 30:15.414
Gotta enjoy the little things.

<i>Rule No. 32

30:31.795 --> 30:34.817
- Going in, it's a trap.

30:34.809 --> 30:36.187
Wait here.

30:36.188 --> 30:37.148
Drive down if I signal.

30:37.990 --> 30:39.856
- You're not gonna shoot them, are you?

30:40.238 --> 30:42.087
- Unless the shoot me.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.352
Oh, let's hope they shoot me.

31:34.635 --> 31:36.040
Looks like they hoofed it.

31:37.207 --> 31:38.579
Probably headed west.

31:39.609 --> 31:41.777
Just drive slow, keep your eyes peeled.

31:46.670 --> 31:47.920
They're in the back, aren't they?

31:48.238 --> 31:49.799
- Just me.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.544
- I'm really sorry.
She was like a crouching tiger.

31:53.669 --> 31:56.431
- You got taken hostage by a twelve year old?

31:56.717 --> 31:58.455
Well, girls mature faster than boys.

31:58.456 --> 32:00.472
She is way ahead of where I was at that age.

32:00.487 --> 32:02.953
- Twelve's the new twenty. Gun please.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.642
- Like you would ever use it..

32:05.643 --> 32:08.235
Don't kill me with my own gun.

32:08.605 --> 32:10.589
- All those violent video games.

32:10.590 --> 32:11.933
- Thank you.

32:12.420 --> 32:14.179
Now honk your horn.
- What?

32:14.180 --> 32:15.140
- Honk it.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.860
- Oh, there's your sister, that's my gun.

32:21.861 --> 32:22.821
Hello.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.821
- Bummer.

32:29.472 --> 32:32.355
Now step away from the vehicle.

32:33.472 --> 32:35.355
You get to ride shotgun

32:43.303 --> 32:44.578
<i>I kinda like this girl.</i>

32:44.925 --> 32:47.245
<i>She's not your typical hot,

32:49.046 --> 32:52.079
<i>Even before Zombieland, Wichita was
running the table on guys like us.</i>

33:07.074 --> 33:08.166
- What are you looking for?

33:07.842 --> 33:09.706
- My engagement ring.

33:11.364 --> 33:15.163
- I took it off to pump my gas
and I thought I had it in my purse,

33:15.164 --> 33:16.604
but it must've fallen out.

33:16.726 --> 33:18.819
And I'm late for my flight..

33:18.821 --> 33:21.809
- Listen, I'll find your ring
and I'll FedEx it to you.

33:22.386 --> 33:23.730
- I'll give you a reward

33:24.307 --> 33:25.267
- Do not be silly.

33:25.268 --> 33:26.228
- Three-thousand dollars.

33:26.775 --> 33:29.481
It's worth more than my car.

33:30.432 --> 33:32.020
- Just, just give me your number.

33:34.087 --> 33:35.210
I'll find it.

33:35.403 --> 33:37.323
Yeah I'll start looking for it right now.

33:37.324 --> 33:38.764
Cause I got nothing else to do.

33:39.999 --> 33:41.950
I was engaged once,

33:41.951 --> 33:43.391
but I'm single now.

33:46.407 --> 33:47.743
Bye

33:50.432 --> 33:51.872
Hope you make your flight.

33:57.870 --> 34:02.172
I know it's around here somewhere,
she's on a plane, that's the beauty of it.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.115
Let me call you back.

34:07.663 --> 34:09.449
Hey, you found my ring.

34:10.902 --> 34:13.022
Thanks, I've been looking all over for it.

34:12.964 --> 34:14.705
- Your ring?
- It was my friend's.

34:15.230 --> 34:17.851
I'm gonna send it to her.
- Do I get a reward?

34:19.734 --> 34:25.032
- 40, 60, 80,
400, That's it. That's the whole register.

34:28.231 --> 34:30.379
You made someone very happy.

34:31.190 --> 34:32.295
- You too.

34:40.445 --> 34:45.071
- How many left?
- Let me see.

34:47.951 --> 34:50.159
Enough for us to get to California.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.040
Someday I want a ring this big.

34:52.561 --> 34:55.440
- For the low price of 30 bucks, sold.

34:57.578 --> 35:01.267
<i>It's amazing how far you can get with some
costume jewelry and a cut-throat attitude.</i>

35:02.161 --> 35:04.924
<i>I guess we're just lucky they
didn't leave us by the side of the road.</i>

35:07.530 --> 35:09.752
- Thank you Wichita,
Thanks Little Rock.

35:14.638 --> 35:17.410
- Hey for fuck's sake, enough already, we're being chased by ravenous freaks.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.724
We don't have enough problems?

35:19.725 --> 35:22.125
"Oh, they stole my Hummer",
"We have trust issues".

35:22.126 --> 35:25.198
Now get over it, okay, we can't just fucking
drive down the road playing I-spy,

35:25.199 --> 35:27.887
or some shit for two hours,
like four normal-ass Americans?

35:27.888 --> 35:29.232
Fuck me!

35:30.533 --> 35:31.753
I know

35:33.770 --> 35:35.594
Let me be the mature one.

35:48.727 --> 35:49.860
- So

35:50.132 --> 35:51.239
Where are you guys headed.

35:51.748 --> 35:53.325
- "Pacific Playland"

35:54.094 --> 35:55.054
- The amusement park?

35:55.055 --> 35:56.207
- Wait, outside LA?

35:56.605 --> 35:57.932
- Yeah, we went there as kids.

35:59.007 --> 36:00.838
- That place totally blows..

36:02.618 --> 36:07.761
my mind. It's so fun. Just good
entertainment for the whole family.

36:08.085 --> 36:12.057
- Yeah actually I went there as a kid too.
In fact this probably counts as off season.

36:12.357 --> 36:15.041
- Well, did you guys hear?
There are no zombies there

36:15.042 --> 36:16.194
- Yeah, we heard.

36:16.195 --> 36:18.019
You know what, I may not shoot you,

36:18.020 --> 36:21.187
but you still royally piss me off.

36:21.188 --> 36:24.452
And I'm not going to play
with you at Pacific Playland.

36:26.313 --> 36:29.244
- Don't worry he grows on you.
- Really?

36:29.341 --> 36:31.453
- No, it's worse.
- Okay.

36:30.885 --> 36:33.263
How about we play the quiet game?

36:33.340 --> 36:34.871
Yeah? Starting now.

36:37.496 --> 36:41.837
- Oh, I've actually been meaning to ask you.
Did you hear anything about Columbus, Ohio?

36:41.838 --> 36:43.757
- You've heard of the quiet game?
- Sorry.

36:43.765 --> 36:45.911
No? Well they're playing
it in Columbus, ohio.

36:45.959 --> 36:48.543
It's a total ghost town,
burned to the ground.

36:57.855 --> 36:59.103
- You're Columbus.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.600
I'm sorry.

37:01.985 --> 37:03.329
I didn't realize it was..

37:05.165 --> 37:06.808
<i>I'm not sure what's more tragic,</i>

37:07.206 --> 37:08.618
<i>That my family is gone,</i>

37:08.619 --> 37:12.267
<i>or the realization that I had
never much of a family to begin with.</i>

37:12.287 --> 37:14.339
<i>Either way I can't pretend
that whatever I'm looking for,</i>

37:14.340 --> 37:15.972
<i>I'll find by going home.</i>

37:16.400 --> 37:17.631
<i>I have no home.</i>

37:20.317 --> 37:21.314
- We can,

37:22.179 --> 37:24.675
give you a ride.

37:25.279 --> 37:28.490
You can go, see for yourself, or settle somewhere new.

37:33.758 --> 37:36.207
<i>I could tell she knew what I was feeling.</i>

37:36.207 --> 37:38.607
<i>We are all orphans in Zombieland.</i>

37:51.759 --> 37:54.351
I know this Pacific Playland thing is nuts,

37:55.216 --> 37:56.752
but,

37:57.041 --> 37:59.633
it's been so long since she got to be a kid.

38:01.129 --> 38:03.205
- It's tough growing up in Zombieland.
- It's tough growing up.

38:12.037 --> 38:14.149
There, you can take that truck.

38:18.758 --> 38:20.870
Well, I,

38:21.047 --> 38:23.505
hope you find whoever it is you're looking for.

38:25.115 --> 38:28.148
And don't let go, once you do.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.248
<i>It wasn't just because i had nowhere else to go.</i>

38:44.097 --> 38:46.439
<i>It was cause in that moment it became clear.</i>

38:47.537 --> 38:48.960
<i>Wherever this girl was,</i>

38:49.703 --> 38:51.287
<i>that's whereIi wanted to be.</i>

39:09.527 --> 39:13.367
- Man we're gonna have to pull over soon.
I'm feeling cooped up.

39:14.328 --> 39:17.399
Wantamiro Wampum, Yeah that'll work.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.128
- Okay but what the hell are we doing?

39:19.321 --> 39:21.433
- Just humor him, trust me.

39:35.359 --> 39:37.279
- Hold on.
- Who wants to go first?

39:38.144 --> 39:40.448
I really, really wanna impress Wichita,

39:41.696 --> 39:45.152
<i>but it would be a direct violation of Rule #17,
maybe the most important of all,</i>

39:45.153 --> 39:47.073
<i>Don't be hero.</i>

39:47.075 --> 39:48.620
- Why don't you take this one.

39:48.716 --> 39:50.060
- Don't mind if I do.

40:04.351 --> 40:07.065
What do you think? Zombie kill of the week?

40:07.157 --> 40:08.882
<i>Close, but no cigar.</i>

40:09.332 --> 40:12.620
<i>Zombie kill of the week goes
to sister Cynthia Knickerbocker.</i>

40:17.819 --> 40:19.374
<i>Poor flat bastard.</i>

40:40.373 --> 40:41.774
- Perfume?
- What?

40:42.522 --> 40:43.927
- Is that perfume?

40:45.704 --> 40:47.147
- It's cologne.

40:47.396 --> 40:49.193
- I'm thinking:

40:49.194 --> 40:51.017
"Lanco Magnifique"

40:51.018 --> 40:53.898
- Why don't you speak up,
they might've missed it in Santa fe.

41:01.699 --> 41:03.948
- Oh my God.
You're thinking about fucking Wichita.

41:05.058 --> 41:08.411
Wish granted. She spent the
last 24 hours fucking us both.

41:11.901 --> 41:14.843
Good luck now Petunia.

41:20.527 --> 41:24.711
- Ok, let me begin my three-part apology by saying

41:24.711 --> 41:27.038
that I think you're a wonderful
human with great potential..

41:27.038 --> 41:32.059
- FYI, I beat wholesale ass
for a lot less than that.

41:32.409 --> 41:37.046
- I'm sure
- You get 45% power.

41:37.046 --> 41:37.893
- Thank you.

41:40.254 --> 41:41.693
Come on, break another one.

41:46.011 --> 41:46.707
Nice.

41:50.773 --> 41:52.244
Doesn't that feel good.

42:39.378 --> 42:42.642
<i>Sometimes Tallahassee's right.
You gotta enjoy the little things.</i>

42:42.778 --> 42:45.469
<i>Even if that means destroying
a whole lot of little things.</i>

42:49.790 --> 42:51.038
- What smells like perfume?

42:54.302 --> 42:56.318
- You don't know who Willie Nelson is?
- No.

42:58.143 --> 43:01.503
- Willie Nelson.
- Yeah, no, I don't.

43:02.272 --> 43:04.946
- Yeah I shave every morning but sometimes

43:04.946 --> 43:09.088
by like 4:30 I have a thing...
(continue rambling)

43:09.089 --> 43:13.217
- Since this is a freeway. You can get it up to 65,
but you don't wanna go more than 75.

43:13.733 --> 43:14.936
- You don't wanna go more than 20.

43:15.554 --> 43:21.076
- Do not worry about it. Blind spots,
blind spots are for other drivers.

43:22.037 --> 43:26.957
- So do you never strap in or just, when on road trips?
- It's just, you know,

43:27.681 --> 43:30.743
there's zombies everywhere.
I think the least of my worries is..

43:30.972 --> 43:31.654
- Yeah that's true.

43:31.655 --> 43:32.615
..seat belts.

43:32.921 --> 43:35.027
- Yes but no, she's not. she's not.

43:35.027 --> 43:37.386
 She's only famous when she's
Hannah Montana, when she's wearing the wig.

43:37.421 --> 43:38.684
-Okay, right.
-So..

43:43.677 --> 43:46.365
- This is kind of freeing.
- Yeah.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.641
<i>For the first time in a long time,</i>

43:51.883 --> 43:53.318
<i>we were having fun.</i>

43:53.383 --> 43:56.103
<i>So even though it ran counter
to our survival strategies,</i>

43:56.104 --> 43:58.504
<i>we decided to stay together
as far as Pacific Playland.</i>

44:26.065 --> 44:29.510
- You know I think sleep deprivation is like
the number one health problem in America.

44:30.279 --> 44:32.487
No, I think it moth be number two.

44:32.488 --> 44:35.368
- Number two..
- That's adorable.

44:35.369 --> 44:38.440
- I'm just saying we should find a place to crash.
- Oh, I got an idea.

44:39.113 --> 44:40.937
We're in Hollywood, let's sleep in style.

44:47.178 --> 44:48.426
Grab a map.

44:54.570 --> 44:56.010
- Come on.
- Hurry.

45:05.446 --> 45:09.159
- It seems like everyone who has
ever been in a movie lives on this block.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.944
- What exactly do you think
we're doing in the 90210 Sally?

45:12.429 --> 45:15.194
- I kind of pictured Tom Cruise
living somewhere nicer.

45:15.195 --> 45:18.074
- B..lister compared to who I got in mind folks.

45:19.035 --> 45:21.819
We are going to the Tipi Top of the A-list.

45:22.108 --> 45:24.412
- Who?
- You'll see.

45:30.164 --> 45:32.464
- Hey, here's a big BM.

45:32.465 --> 45:34.193
- It ain't Bob Marley.

45:40.721 --> 45:42.161
- This place is incredible.

45:53.201 --> 45:58.961
- Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to La Menzion de Murray.

45:58.962 --> 46:00.594
- Oh, Bill Murray

46:00.760 --> 46:01.756
- God, no way.

46:02.162 --> 46:05.749
This guy has a direct line
to my funny bone, I mean every..

46:05.750 --> 46:07.670
- Boy, who's Bill Murray?

46:07.671 --> 46:13.430
- I have never hit a kid before,
but I mean that's like asking who Gandhi is.

46:14.007 --> 46:15.351
- Who's Gandhi?

46:16.120 --> 46:17.272
- She's twelve.

46:21.113 --> 46:23.032
- No Twinkies.
- Shit Bob.

46:22.916 --> 46:26.639
- See? I told you we should've gone to
Russel Crowe's. No one listens to me.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.080
- Hello, inside voices, okay?

46:28.081 --> 46:29.521
- At least until we know we are alone.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.080
- Hey Tallahassee, Wichita
why don't you take that way.

46:31.522 --> 46:33.361
Little Rock come here.

46:33.362 --> 46:34.802
Why do I get stuck with her?

46:38.643 --> 46:39.987
It doesn't seem to end.

46:46.035 --> 46:46.995
Hey come here.

46:49.204 --> 46:51.796
He has his own movie theatre?

46:55.349 --> 46:57.461
Ok, I'm gonna teach you
a little something about Bill Murray.

46:59.669 --> 47:01.301
The king slept right here.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.301
Dibs on the bed.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.236
Too soft for me anyway.

47:16.705 --> 47:19.645
Oh, this is so exciting, you're about
to learn who you're gonna call.

47:19.934 --> 47:21.182
Ghostbusters.

47:38.462 --> 47:41.341
This is pretty catchy.

47:44.221 --> 47:48.061
Help me with the boots, come on.
Help me with the boots.

47:49.598 --> 47:51.230
Ok, I'll get 'em myself.

48:17.624 --> 48:19.174
Bill Murray, you're a zombie?

48:27.416 --> 48:29.318
You're not a zombie, you're talking.

48:29.559 --> 48:30.802
You're okay.

48:30.965 --> 48:35.908
- The hell I am.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know that it was you-you.

48:35.842 --> 48:38.003
Are you..What's with the,
the get up?

48:38.184 --> 48:42.787
Oh, I do it to blend in, you know
zombies don't mess with other zombies.

48:42.788 --> 48:45.188
Buddy of mine, make-up guy,
showed how to do this.

48:45.381 --> 48:48.615
Corn starch, you know some berries,
a little liquish for the ladies.

48:48.627 --> 48:51.482
It suits my lifestyle. You know I like to get out and do stuff.

48:52.077 --> 48:56.053
Just played nine holes at the Riviera,
just walked on, nobody there.

48:56.342 --> 48:59.222
Goddamn it,
Bill fucking Murray.

49:00.767 --> 49:02.974
I had to get that out.
I don't mean to gush.

49:02.975 --> 49:07.774
This is so surreal, I mean. You probably
get this all the time,well, maybe not lately,

49:07.776 --> 49:09.771
but I'm such a huge fan of yours.

49:09.965 --> 49:13.885
I've seen everyone of your movies a million times.

49:13.886 --> 49:16.766
I even love your dramatic roles, everything.

49:18.976 --> 49:23.071
Six people left in the world,
one of them is Bill fucking Murray.

49:23.071 --> 49:24.543
I know that's not your middle name.

49:24.543 --> 49:29.534
But I've been watching you since i was like.. 
since I could masturbate, not that they're connected.

49:31.011 --> 49:32.930
You know "A former greenskeeper
about to become the master champion."

49:38.653 --> 49:39.935
- That's why we do it.

49:40.991 --> 49:42.732
- I love you Bill, I love you.

49:44.354 --> 49:45.695
- Thank you.

49:46.185 --> 49:48.788
- You are staring at me, it's a hairpiece it's a..

49:48.789 --> 49:52.244
- Sorry, it's just that you look remarkably like Eddy Van Halen.

49:52.245 --> 49:53.589
- I Just saw Eddy Van Halen.

49:53.590 --> 49:54.934
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:55.647 --> 49:56.762
- Where?
- At the Hollywood bowl.

49:57.357 --> 49:59.138
- Well, how was it?
- He's a zombie

49:59.696 --> 50:01.585
- That's a tough break.

50:01.616 --> 50:06.384
- So how about a little west coast hospitality. Can I get you something? What would you like?

50:06.616 --> 50:12.000
<i>[Blue Oyster Cult - Don't Fear The Reaper]</i>

50:21.057 --> 50:24.376
- Oh hurry, hurry he's on the ceiling. Come get him. Oh..

50:25.625 --> 50:28.121
- Light 'em up Murray.
- See you on the other side Pete.

50:29.082 --> 50:30.522
- You're so disgusting.

50:32.193 --> 50:33.816
- Don't cross the streams.

50:34.681 --> 50:38.617
- I don't wanna cross..
- Don't cross the streams!

50:40.000 --> 50:45.500
- "35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds"
- "That's a big Twinkie"

50:45.952 --> 50:49.998
- Your sister's single, right? There's nothing long-distance or anything.

50:50.383 --> 50:52.303
- No.
- Good, good.

50:53.299 --> 50:58.319
And if she had, like, a type - if you can have a type - what would that be?

50:59.471 --> 51:01.934
- She kinda goes for, like, bad boys.

51:01.935 --> 51:03.087
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:03.088 --> 51:04.336
- That's cool.

51:08.472 --> 51:11.408
- So Columbus is the scared one?
- Yeah, he's like a little bunny.

51:13.288 --> 51:15.233
- I'll get him.

51:17.446 --> 51:18.527
Watch this.

51:30.047 --> 51:32.735
- It's okay, it's okay. I got him.

51:36.996 --> 51:39.581
Is that how you say hello where you come from?

51:40.832 --> 51:43.941
Oh my God, Oh my God I can't believe I shot Bill Murray.

51:46.117 --> 51:47.520
Mr. Murray?

51:47.449 --> 51:50.844
Just Bill I think now.

51:50.845 --> 51:51.997
- Bill?
- Yeah?

51:52.958 --> 51:56.797
- I don't think we're gonna be able to stitch this.

51:58.046 --> 51:59.678
- Ow, that's still tender.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.523
- You think you might pull through?

52:05.203 --> 52:06.283
- No.

52:06.737 --> 52:09.044
- If it means anything now I am so sorry.

52:09.912 --> 52:11.217
It was just instinctive.

52:11.747 --> 52:12.915
- It was my bad.

52:13.133 --> 52:15.424
I was never a very good practical joker.

52:16.461 --> 52:18.696
- So do you have any regrets?

52:21.632 --> 52:23.662
"Garfield", maybe.

52:47.662 --> 52:49.966
- I'm sorry, he just gets me.

52:51.694 --> 52:53.422
But it still is sad.
- Yeah.

53:13.294 --> 53:15.694
- Sorry. One second

53:16.175 --> 53:17.519
-It's a double-barrel so..

53:19.055 --> 53:19.823
Okay.

53:25.104 --> 53:27.024
3, 2, 1.

53:30.001 --> 53:32.785
- You guys want some caramel?
- Yes.

53:41.423 --> 53:42.676
- Oh Free parking, which coincidentally

53:42.965 --> 53:45.461
is the best thing about Zombieland.

53:45.653 --> 53:48.533
- No, best thing about Z-land:
No Facebook status updates.

53:48.534 --> 53:51.414
You know "Rob Curtis is gearing up for Friday".

53:51.527 --> 53:52.653
Who cares.

53:52.813 --> 53:56.511
- The best thing is no more flushing, epic.

53:56.546 --> 53:58.703
- And worst thing?
About Z-land?

53:59.015 --> 54:01.487
- You mean other than the
fact that I shot Bill Murray?

54:01.488 --> 54:02.448
- That's easy.

54:02.833 --> 54:04.464
- Losing Bob.

54:04.657 --> 54:05.713
- That's his puppy.

54:07.250 --> 54:11.090
- I tell you, I never thought
I could love anything like Bob

54:11.227 --> 54:14.598
The day he was born I just lost my mind.

54:16.844 --> 54:17.910
- Sorry.

54:23.149 --> 54:27.368
He had my personality,
my laugh, my appetite,

54:27.631 --> 54:32.598
<i>Laugh? And that's when it hit me.
I felt so ashamed that it had taken me this long.</i>

54:32.931 --> 54:37.335
<i>Me with the best cardio in the business to realize
I wasn't the only one running from something.</i>

55:00.854 --> 55:03.254
- We made this wallet together
out of Duct Tape.

55:09.324 --> 55:13.683
<i> Take away a man's son, you've
truly given him nothing left to lose.</i>

55:23.667 --> 55:27.315
- I haven't cried like that since Titanic.

56:06.389 --> 56:11.983
A hint?
Why don't you exhale slowly,

56:12.676 --> 56:13.880
then squeeze the trigger.

56:47.191 --> 56:49.303
- Don't make me drink alone.
- Okay.

56:56.504 --> 56:59.767
-It 1997, "Gor Gorgeous"

57:01.304 --> 57:03.032
- I never took French.

57:02.457 --> 57:03.417
Gorgeus day what the hell?

57:05.974 --> 57:07.575
- It's a 97?
- Yeah.

57:08.606 --> 57:10.148
- Was that a good year?
- Oh my God.

57:10.720 --> 57:15.391
It was a great year, are you kidding me?,
I saw my first R- rated movie that year.

57:16.352 --> 57:18.464
Anaconda.
- Oh, Anaconda.

57:21.365 --> 57:22.631
- First tattoo, a purpoise.

57:23.304 --> 57:24.648
- Really?
- Fake.

57:25.513 --> 57:26.665
- First kiss.

57:28.394 --> 57:29.834
Scotty Lynch

57:31.803 --> 57:33.100
- Did you guys.. use tongue?

57:35.166 --> 57:36.732
- Maybe.

57:38.653 --> 57:41.820
- Are you jealous of Scotty Lynch?
- Yes, I am.

57:43.452 --> 57:46.620
- Actually I think I'm jealous of your whole 1997.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.213
- Let's see mine.

57:51.646 --> 57:55.217
First orthodontist. The bastard gave me head gear.

57:56.178 --> 57:58.290
- I got my first B.
- Oh no.

57:59.443 --> 58:01.171
- Frightening, as Anaconda

58:02.323 --> 58:05.011
Woodshop, which doesn't really count as a class anyway.

58:07.891 --> 58:10.003
Had my first school dance.

58:10.165 --> 58:12.795
I was Sadie Hawkins..

58:13.276 --> 58:14.716
girls choice.

58:17.404 --> 58:19.132
- What nobody picked you?

58:19.380 --> 58:20.785
- Iz was girls choice.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.068
- Those bitches!
- I know.

58:24.029 --> 58:26.909
No, I will not stand for this, you know what?

58:27.390 --> 58:29.598
On behalf of all the eight-grade girls,

58:31.230 --> 58:32.862
I would like you to make it up to you.

58:35.797 --> 58:36.959
Relax, Scotty's old news.

59:13.039 --> 59:16.161
I don't even know your name,
but this is actually really nice.

59:17.650 --> 59:20.311
-You know? Between you, me and

59:23.326 --> 59:24.724
You're actually kind of cute.

59:25.252 --> 59:26.584
- You think so?

59:28.601 --> 59:32.345
- I mean you got the guts of a guppy, but

59:32.692 --> 59:34.156
I could hit that.

59:38.189 --> 59:39.629
- Really?

59:40.590 --> 59:42.510
- I'll at least give you the intentional walk to first.

59:54.208 --> 59:56.338
- Hey little help movin' a couch.

59:57.023 --> 59:58.846
We're making a fort.

01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:08.062
- That was probably for the best, cause

01:00:09.407 --> 01:00:12.479
I like you, Columbus,

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.320
but my sister and I are going to do whatever it takes to survive so..

01:00:27.805 --> 01:00:30.073
<i>I was hoping Wichita was just playing hard to get,</i>

01:00:30.504 --> 01:00:33.507
<i>but I realized that she had more trust issues than I did.</i>

01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:36.388
<i>When I woke up the next day and she was leaving.</i>

01:00:40.453 --> 01:00:42.611
- You are like a giant cock-blocking robot,

01:00:42.612 --> 01:00:45.971
developed in a secret fucking government lab.

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:49.538
- I can't believe I almost kissed him. What's our rule?

01:00:50.216 --> 01:00:53.138
- Trust no one, just you and me.
- Just you and me.

01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:55.827
- Yeah, you and me.

01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:13.100
- You have just survived the zombie apocalypse
and drove halfway across the country.

01:01:13.686 --> 01:01:16.949
- Where are you gonna go?
- I'm going to Pacific Playland. Woo.

01:01:36.148 --> 01:01:37.588
Open Sesame.

01:01:47.608 --> 01:01:49.903
<i>This is the problem with
getting attached to someone.</i>

01:01:50.588 --> 01:01:52.191
<i>When they leave you just feel lost.</i>

01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:56.946
<i>Having Tallahassee around didn't comfort me,
it just made me feel more alone.</i>

01:01:56.947 --> 01:02:00.787
- Hey, you weren't exactly gonna score anyway.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
- You weren't storming' the trenches before I came along.

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:09.451
That's why I don't let people close, you only get burned.

01:02:09.644 --> 01:02:10.508
- You don't say.

01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:17.526
Mexico, you know what they call Twinkies
in Mexico? Los Submerinos.

01:02:17.955 --> 01:02:19.818
That's where I'm headed amigo.

01:02:20.683 --> 01:02:21.835
- Whatever.

01:03:47.287 --> 01:03:49.162
- I'm going after Wichita.

01:03:49.163 --> 01:03:52.043
- You ever read that book "She's just not that into you"?

01:03:52.298 --> 01:03:55.724
- You can't make yourself too available.
- I don't care, alright I wanna be with her.

01:03:57.469 --> 01:03:58.628
Have fun in Mexico.

01:04:04.495 --> 01:04:05.476
Come on! Hurry!

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:10.277
- Get in!

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:21.172
- Come on, come on!

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:24.533
- Come on, come on!

01:04:36.824 --> 01:04:40.129
- On the count of three.
One, two, three.

01:04:54.787 --> 01:04:56.272
Are you okay? Come on.

01:04:56.587 --> 01:04:57.751
Hurry, get up.

01:04:57.752 --> 01:04:58.808
- Come on, let's go.

01:05:04.043 --> 01:05:05.209
- There!

01:05:31.617 --> 01:05:34.958
- That's the worst goodbye I have ever
heard and you stole it from a movie.

01:05:38.929 --> 01:05:40.556
- Tell the ladies I said hey.

01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:43.629
- You know there are pictures of
her in someones wallet too.

01:06:08.146 --> 01:06:11.787
- Hop in the car Evel Knievel.
Let's go ride the roller coaster.

01:06:12.265 --> 01:06:13.349
- Thanks.

01:06:23.621 --> 01:06:24.869
- Go!

01:07:22.946 --> 01:07:24.962
- Not as fun as I remember.

01:07:29.955 --> 01:07:31.875
- Shoot the control box.

01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:04.758
- Columbus.
- Tallahassee.

01:08:04.759 --> 01:08:08.888
- I think they might actually require our
hard assistance this time. 

01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:12.368
- Buckle up.
- Yup, I'm wide ahead of you.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.471
Time to nut up or shut up.

01:08:21.272 --> 01:08:22.232
Holy shit.

01:08:43.627 --> 01:08:48.133
My mama always told me,
someday I'll be good at something.

01:08:48.134 --> 01:08:50.246
Who'd have guessed that
something'd be zombie killin'.

01:08:50.535 --> 01:08:51.591
- Probably nobody.

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:54.685
- Look!

01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:58.999
- We better start working on our apology.

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:26.166
- Up here!

01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:28.663
-Oh my God!

01:09:33.758 --> 01:09:34.919
- They're up there, they're okay.

01:09:35.202 --> 01:09:36.598
- What are you waiting for?
- It's your gal.

01:09:43.857 --> 01:09:47.104
- Come on!
- Come get a piece of Tallahassee!

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:48.737
- Anybody hungry?

01:09:49.122 --> 01:09:51.618
Tallahassee-nice over here.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.576
Come on, come on you ugly bastards.

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:14.401
- Holy Shit!

01:10:16.706 --> 01:10:18.242
- Holy Shit!

01:11:16.055 --> 01:11:17.795
- Shit, I'm out of shells.

01:11:43.907 --> 01:11:45.155
- Here we go.

01:14:14.096 --> 01:14:15.508
- Wichita! Little Rock!

01:14:19.712 --> 01:14:21.065
<i>Oh my God.</i>

01:14:21.965 --> 01:14:23.644
<i>Look at this fucking clown.</i>

01:14:26.948 --> 01:14:30.047
<i>Of course, it had to be a clown.</i>

01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:35.295
<i>No, it had to be a clown.</i>

01:14:35.816 --> 01:14:38.490
<i>And it had to be Wichita
for me to finally understand</i>

01:14:38.726 --> 01:14:41.134
<i>that some rules are made to be broken.</i>

01:14:45.029 --> 01:14:46.469
<i>Time to nut up or shut up.</i>

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.674
<i>Fuck this clown.</i>

01:15:35.181 --> 01:15:36.170
- Thanks.

01:15:36.863 --> 01:15:37.994
Wichita

01:15:50.102 --> 01:15:52.755
- Christa.

01:16:24.155 --> 01:16:26.864
- Ok, we should probably head out, now.

01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:34.140
- Finally he got to first base.

01:16:34.621 --> 01:16:37.021
Not bad for that scrawny little spit-fuck.

01:16:44.802 --> 01:16:46.475
- Where is [Tallahassee]

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.711
- I have a little hunch.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.981
Where are you you spongy yellow
delicious bastards? Where are you?

01:17:05.608 --> 01:17:09.760
- False advertising!
- Jesus Christ.

01:17:11.297 --> 01:17:12.641
- You want a Sno-Ball or something?

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.768
- Oh God!

01:17:47.242 --> 01:17:49.314
Words cannot express..

01:17:50.859 --> 01:17:52.201
- It's too soon.

01:17:52.202 --> 01:17:55.081
- Do you think you can, maybe, just pick out
the Buckshot and just kind of eat around it?

01:17:59.306 --> 01:18:00.362
- No!

01:18:01.323 --> 01:18:02.283
No!

01:18:02.764 --> 01:18:03.724
- No!

01:18:05.932 --> 01:18:09.484
<i>That face. That's me realizing
that those smart girls</i>

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:10.925
<i>in that big black truck</i>

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.895
<i>and that big guy in that snakeskin jacket</i>

01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:18.427
<i>they were the closest to something
I had always wanted, but never really had.</i>

01:18:19.441 --> 01:18:20.927
<i>A family.</i>

01:18:21.091 --> 01:18:22.951
<i>I trusted them and they trusted me.</i>

01:18:27.252 --> 01:18:30.046
<i>Rule #32:
Enjoy The Little Things.</i>

01:18:30.346 --> 01:18:31.959
<i>Tallahassee got his Twinkie</i>

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:35.873
<i>and even though life will never
be simple or innocent again,</i>

01:18:36.804 --> 01:18:39.846
<i>as he savored that spongy yellow log of cream,</i>

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:42.685
<i>we had hope, we had each other.</i>

01:18:43.797 --> 01:18:47.473
<i>And without other people, you might swell be a zombie.</i>

01:18:48.818 --> 01:18:49.682
- Thank you so much
- You had us going.

01:18:55.442 --> 01:18:56.882
<i>So until next time remember:</i>

01:18:56.970 --> 01:18:58.480
<i>Cardio, seat belts</i>

01:18:58.769 --> 01:19:02.705
<i>and this really has nothing to do with anything,
but a little sunscreen never hurt anybody.</i>

01:19:04.722 --> 01:19:08.658
<i>I'm  Columbus, Ohio, from Zombieland saying:
Good night.</i>
