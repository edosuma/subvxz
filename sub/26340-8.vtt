WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.770
Grab a seat with The Cool Kids.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.472
Oh, that's not gonna
be a problem.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.939
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.641
And check out
our other programs--

00:07.675 --> 00:09.177
Last Man Standing and Rel.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.778
Only on Fox.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.218
(grunting)
Ooh.

00:20.888 --> 00:24.458
Ooh. (groans)

00:24.492 --> 00:26.294
(sighs)

00:26.327 --> 00:28.629
How's everybody doing?

00:28.662 --> 00:31.765
(laughs)
What is with that walk?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.534
Well, if you must know,

00:33.567 --> 00:36.204
I was salsa dancing
till midnight.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.139
You were salsa dancing?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.108
You get winded salsa eating.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.311
Late night dancing, smiling--

00:43.344 --> 00:45.113
you've been happy for weeks now.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.315
That's very unlike you.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.017
Well, I guess I need
to let you all in on something.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.986
I'm dating a younger woman.
Felicia.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.655
(chuckles) She's gorgeous

00:54.688 --> 00:56.056
and full of life.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.227
And get this, she's 45. (laughs)

00:59.260 --> 01:01.895
Jailbait, baby!

01:01.929 --> 01:03.664
Damn, you're robbing the cradle.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.234
-(laughing)
-Uh, no, whoa, whoa.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.602
My high fives
tend to be unconvincing.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.071
I'm better with a "hoo, mama."

01:11.105 --> 01:15.343
45-year-old? Hoo, mama!

01:15.376 --> 01:17.578
See?

01:17.611 --> 01:20.214
I mean, there's obviously
something wrong with this woman.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.584
What, does she need
a green card? A kidney?

01:23.617 --> 01:27.054
I'm just trying to figure
what would drive a 45-year-old

01:27.087 --> 01:29.056
to this.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.725
We have a lot in common.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.827
See, we met at this
jazz record store.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.930
I went in there to find
a very rare Miles Davis album,

01:36.964 --> 01:39.066
on which he calls
his bass player

01:39.099 --> 01:41.101
a particularly outdated slur.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.571
And we hit it off.

01:43.604 --> 01:47.608
She's a old soul.
I feel like a teenager again.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.211
Hoo, mama!

01:50.244 --> 01:53.581
And she's, what,
terminally ill?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.384
No. The only thing
she's dying from is Hank fever.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.319
And the only cure
for that is more

01:58.352 --> 01:59.987
Hank, Hank, Hank.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.456
Ask your doctor about Hank.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.893
Side effects include delusion,

02:05.926 --> 02:08.962
overconfidence,
and extreme hair loss.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.573
I knew you were gonna do this.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.076
You just jealous
'cause you not cradle robbing.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.446
I'm not jealous. I might be

02:25.479 --> 02:27.448
a-a little annoyed
at the double standard.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.884
I mean, you never see a younger
man with an older woman.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.621
Uh, I've actually been
with a much older woman.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.123
Well, not recently.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.327
No, I was 18, she was 65.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.962
She was born in 1899.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.799
Anyway...

02:45.833 --> 02:47.167
she's obviously
out of your league.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.637
I'm just trying to get
to the real truth.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.839
Well, Felicia...

02:51.872 --> 02:54.642
and I have a real connection.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.577
Oh! In fact,
she wants to meet you guys.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.179
So you can judge for yourself
that it is real.

02:59.213 --> 03:03.016
FYI, I'm gonna need you all to
lie, tell her I don't live here.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.552
Why? This place rocks.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.988
We got unlimited Froyo.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.857
Well, she's young. She doesn't
want to date somebody

03:09.890 --> 03:11.525
living in
a retirement community.

03:11.559 --> 03:15.496
So I told her my home
is under renovation.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.466
(sadly):
Hoo, mama.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.201
Eh, shouldn't she like you
for you? I mean, we'll play...

03:21.235 --> 03:23.504
All right, great,
let's leave it there, then.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.806
I got it-- she's blind.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.709
Margaret, I'm happy.
Just leave it alone.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.980
-Fine, I will drop it.
-(grunting)

03:33.013 --> 03:37.251
I am not dropping squat.
Something is off, right, guys?

03:37.285 --> 03:40.488
I mean, a younger woman
who is suddenly into Hank?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.390
Oh, he's fine.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.158
I'm just worried he's gonna
humiliate himself

03:45.192 --> 03:47.060
trying to seem younger.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.696
-(phone chimes)
-Ooh!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.899
My wheelie sneakers
just shipped!

03:54.902 --> 03:56.904
*

04:16.957 --> 04:19.793
And then this big hunk of man

04:19.827 --> 04:21.762
just swept me off my feet.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.564
Now, how'd I sweep you
off your feet

04:23.597 --> 04:25.499
when you already
swept me off mine?

04:25.533 --> 04:28.369
Answer is my
athletic youthfulness.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.270
-(laughs)
-Ow.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.106
Yeah, dancing does keep
the body young.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.608
That's, uh,
what I always say, right?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.877
-Always.
-Always. That's what he says.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.012
I feel like you always say,
"My lower back hurts."

04:39.046 --> 04:43.617
You know, it is great to finally
meet all of Hank's friends.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.553
Yep, yep, yep.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.188
We're just his buds
from down the street.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.591
It's a normal street

04:50.624 --> 04:55.228
with separate houses
and outdoor space between them.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.466
He never brings
his trash cans in.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.434
It's ruining the neighborhood.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.036
(laughs)

05:03.070 --> 05:05.138
You guys crack me up,
especially this one.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.040
I just want to put you
in a backpack

05:07.074 --> 05:08.909
-and take you everywhere.
-(laughing)

05:08.942 --> 05:12.813
Well, let's not forget
that I'm a human being.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.384
But that sounds like fun.
You're fun.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.486
Isn't she fun?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.287
Almost like it's too good
to be true.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.023
It's almost exactly like
it's too good to be true.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.493
Hey, Hank, did you confirm
our reservation at Morano's?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.327
-Yes, I did.
-Okay.

05:27.361 --> 05:31.599
Wow, Morano's. Fancy.
And Hank is taking you there?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.866
Mm-hmm.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.334
Did they open up
their dress code

05:34.368 --> 05:36.670
to Crocs and bowling shirts?

05:36.704 --> 05:37.871
No.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.474
Did they?

05:40.508 --> 05:43.110
You know what?
I am gonna hit up that jukebox.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.979
You got any cash, Hanky poo?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.315
Baby, I got you, baby boo.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.784
(laughs)
There you go, madam.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.820
-Grab a fistful.
-Hey, hey.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.825
Sid, I think I know
what's going on.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.528
The 20 for the jukebox,
Morano's--

06:00.561 --> 06:03.096
I think maybe "baby boo"
is a gold digger.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.965
I'm gonna go see
what I can find out.

06:04.998 --> 06:08.301
(clears throat) I think I'm
gonna go hit the jukebox, too.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.070
See if they have any Mozart.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.974
Hey, there.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.810
Son of a... Sorry,
you scared me. (chuckles)

06:16.844 --> 06:18.345
Oh, nothing to be scared of,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.313
unless I'm catching you
doing something wrong.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.849
Am I?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.818
(laughs)

06:24.852 --> 06:27.821
So have you, uh, have you ever
dated an older man before?

06:27.855 --> 06:31.324
-Older men are kind of my type.
-Interesting.

06:31.358 --> 06:35.062
It's a pattern.
You kind of target them.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.931
Yeah, that's not exactly
what I'm saying.

06:37.965 --> 06:41.334
Uh, older men know themselves.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.804
They don't play games.
They're more mature.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.405
Really? That guy?

06:45.439 --> 06:47.441
(laughter)

06:51.612 --> 06:54.915
Oh, my God, he is so funny
and so nice.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.251
Really? We're s-we're still
talking about Hank, right?

06:59.487 --> 07:02.222
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.458
I see why you came over here.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.494
You have feelings for him.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.161
(laughing):
What?

07:08.195 --> 07:10.163
Whoa. Hank? No.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.501
Ooh, never. Ew, gross.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.735
Yeah, but I thought
that maybe...

07:14.768 --> 07:17.070
Yuck. Gag. Puke.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.340
(shivers)
Nasty.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.811
Okay. I'm just gonna
head back to the table now.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.781
Hey, Hanky poo, why don't we
hit Morano's early?

07:27.815 --> 07:30.383
It was nice meeting you guys.

07:30.417 --> 07:34.054
Margaret, I hope you
find happiness.

07:34.087 --> 07:37.925
You know what,
I've had a few drinks.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.127
-Mm.
-So, let's Uber. Ooh!

07:40.160 --> 07:43.063
Maybe we'll be bad and Uber XL.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.365
-Do they have a Uber XXL?
-(both laugh)

07:46.900 --> 07:49.036
Nice girl.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.404
I don't know why she just wants
Margaret to find happiness,

07:51.438 --> 07:53.440
but, uh, nice girl.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.609
Nice girl? Come on, Charlie.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.411
She's taking Hank
to the cleaners.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.413
Margaret thinks that Felicia

08:00.447 --> 08:02.149
is gold digging Hank.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.985
I know she is. You think about
what's going on here, guys.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.988
He's flashing cash at
the record store, the Uber XL.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.758
He bought us a round.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.561
Hank has no gold to dig.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.128
Yeah, Sid's right, Margaret.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.998
Most of Hank's wealth
is in baseball cards.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.499
Well, that proves my point.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.501
Rich guys know to look out
for a gold digger.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.638
It's the pathetic schlubs like
Hank that never see it coming.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.307
She's gonna fleece him and
move right on to the next guy.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.209
I think she may be
on to something.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.911
I am. Hank is our friend,

08:30.944 --> 08:32.345
and somebody's trying
to take advantage of him,

08:32.379 --> 08:33.814
and we can't let that happen.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.884
I ain't saying
she's a gold digger,

08:36.917 --> 08:40.020
but she ain't messing
with no broke...

08:40.053 --> 08:41.555
Well, y'all know the song.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.263
(vocalizing)

08:50.297 --> 08:52.065
All right, here he comes.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.301
We're gonna tell him
the truth about Felicia

08:54.334 --> 08:56.036
and we're gonna do it
together, okay?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.905
-Yeah. Yeah. You got it.
-I got your back, girl.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.707
(scatting)

09:02.976 --> 09:05.312
What happened to the limp,
lover boy?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.681
Well, I stole some
of Larry's muscle relaxers.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.349
That fool is relaxed
enough as it is.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.986
(mouthing)

09:13.020 --> 09:15.322
So, uh...

09:15.355 --> 09:18.558
what's up with y'all?

09:18.592 --> 09:21.028
We, uh, we all have something
that we want to tell you.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.395
Yeah.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.632
But it's mostly
Margaret's thing.

09:24.665 --> 09:28.235
Yeah, you're gonna be
pretty pissed, but...

09:28.268 --> 09:31.038
Tell him, Margaret.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.973
-It's about Felicia.
-Oh!

09:33.006 --> 09:34.574
Speak of the devil.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.177
I'm on my way to meet her
at the roller rink.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.913
When's the last time
you went roller skating?

09:39.947 --> 09:42.049
Well, not that long ago.
I guess about, uh...

09:42.082 --> 09:44.051
47 years.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.387
But I'm gonna do it for her.
You know, for the first time,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.590
I'm not even thinking
about my ex-wife.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.761
Felicia is just fantastic,
and she's funny, too.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.363
She just makes me feel alive.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.599
So, uh, y'all wanted to tell me
something about her?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.902
-She's... We're happy for you.
-She is great. Great gal.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.705
I got to lock this one down.
Well, I'm off to the rink.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.706
Okay.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.474
(quietly): Ow.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.945
So what if we are wrong
about Felicia?

10:11.979 --> 10:14.782
We could ruin
a really good thing for Hank.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.250
In the small chance
that I am wrong--

10:17.284 --> 10:20.253
the small, small, small chance--

10:20.287 --> 10:22.055
we have to get some evidence
before we confront him,

10:22.089 --> 10:23.623
and we better do it quick.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.794
I mean, you heard him,
he's gonna lock it down.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.929
I just need five minutes
with her phone.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.732
It'll have bank records
and clues from her past.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.600
I know what I'm doing.
(chuckles)

10:33.633 --> 10:36.136
I worked with
the Watergate burglars.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.940
They are famous for literally
nothing besides getting caught.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.541
Yeah.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.611
They got caught.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.280
Well, if it's Felicia's phone
that we want,

10:47.314 --> 10:50.751
we know exactly where
it will be: at the roller rink.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.186
Sid, we are not going
to a roller rink

10:53.220 --> 10:54.922
so you can go skating.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.290
It is not that, Margaret.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.292
I want to help Hank.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.494
Do you think they'll have
the hokey pokey? Ooh!

11:01.528 --> 11:03.363
I got to go get my wheel wax.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.471
*

11:11.504 --> 11:13.473
(dance music playing)

11:13.506 --> 11:16.309
All right. We got Mitch
on the tunes tonight,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.378
so expect a lot of bangers.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.647
Skittle machine's on the right.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.350
Claw machine
is the tightest in Tucson,

11:23.383 --> 11:26.553
so don't waste your time.

11:26.586 --> 11:30.190
I mean, I've never
been here before, but...

11:30.223 --> 11:32.625
Usual skates, Mr. Delacroix?

11:32.659 --> 11:35.528
Yes, clerk who somehow knows
my name.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.965
(quietly):
Be cool, Terrance.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.100
Sid, we're not gonna skate.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.902
We're here on a mission,
and we can't

11:41.935 --> 11:43.871
let Hank and Felicia see us.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.705
(both giggling)

11:45.739 --> 11:47.340
BOTH:
Ooh!

11:47.374 --> 11:49.442
The secret to black ops
is speed.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.311
We find her purse,
get her phone,

11:51.344 --> 11:54.447
I leave a Monopoly token
because that's my calling card,

11:54.481 --> 11:56.750
and then we exit unnoticed.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.152
I just wish we had air support.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.553
Why?

12:00.587 --> 12:02.722
I just wish we did.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.558
All right, someone has to keep
an eye out for Hank.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.894
On it.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.966
How did he get those skates on
so fast?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.203
Well, if we had air support,
we'd know.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.373
There you go, okay, you got it.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.342
-Here, I'll catch you.
-Oh, you're always trying

12:22.375 --> 12:24.711
to get your hands on me,
aren't you, cutie?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.579
-Whoa! Ooh!
-Oh!

12:26.613 --> 12:28.148
(panting):
I got... I'm okay.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.884
I feel like Kristi Yamaguchi
up in here.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.520
We don't have to do this,

12:33.553 --> 12:35.455
since, you know,
you're not very good at it.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.524
Well, I'm more
of a speed skater,

12:37.557 --> 12:39.292
and that's really not what
this rink is set up for.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.861
Ah.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.395
But you go ahead on.
I'm-a catch up to you.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.663
Go, go, go, go, go.
(chuckles)

12:43.696 --> 12:45.498
Go.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.845
Okay, her purse is
in there somewhere.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.281
Yeah, I got this.
Follow my lead. (clears throat)

13:01.314 --> 13:04.117
There's a corpse
in the bathroom.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.685
MARGARET:
Yeah, uh,

13:05.718 --> 13:07.020
a-a big old corpse.

13:07.054 --> 13:10.590
The kids are playing on it.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.961
Maybe a heads-up if you're gonna
take it to "bathroom corpse"

13:13.994 --> 13:15.628
right off the bat?

13:15.662 --> 13:18.731
Heads-up for life. I always take
it to "bathroom corpse"

13:18.765 --> 13:20.433
right off the bat.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.137
Let's just find this purse.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.173
I need a size seven.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.646
(quietly):
Seven.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.748
-Aren't you gonna spray them?
-Uh...

13:35.782 --> 13:37.985
Uh, sorry, sweetie,
it's my first day.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.620
I can tell,
'cause you suck at your job.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.655
Oh, really?

13:44.124 --> 13:47.827
Ugh!

13:47.861 --> 13:49.930
Move.

13:49.963 --> 13:53.833
Who do you think you're talking
to, little missy?

13:53.867 --> 13:56.469
We're about to do
the limbo here.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.273
Well, do it someplace else.
I'm putting in work.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.509
You're old.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.245
I have lived a life.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.681
You are gonna marry
your first boyfriend

14:08.715 --> 14:12.385
and die within six miles
of this rink, sweet pea.

14:17.724 --> 14:22.329
Ugh, this has got to be
the smelliest black op ever.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.098
-Charlie, wait.
-What? What?

14:25.132 --> 14:27.334
This could be our girl's.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.337
Look, "I Heart Jazz" keychain.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.172
Oh, yeah, it's definitely her.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.507
(chuckles)
Her picture's on the phone here.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.610
I'm gonna try to hack in.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.413
One, two,

14:40.447 --> 14:43.183
three, four.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.886
Nope. I'm out of ideas.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.889
Well, we're gonna
have to dig deeper.

14:49.923 --> 14:52.159
Sid's still on lookout, right?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.395
(cheering, applause)

14:59.232 --> 15:01.901
Okay, Gramps,
you're pretty good.

15:01.935 --> 15:06.306
Well, I ought to be. I lived
most of my life on the down-low.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.941
(laughs)

15:09.977 --> 15:13.613
You'll get it
when you get older.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.716
And this one definitely will.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.719
All right, here we go.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.722
Two, two, three, four.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.524
No.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.994
I'm gonna try my birthday.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.397
Why would she use
your birthday as her code?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.799
-Exactly.
-(scoffs)

15:34.134 --> 15:35.302
Charlie, look.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.737
Holy guacamole.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.872
(exhales)
It's worse than we thought.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.042
What the hell
are you two doing here?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.610
Is that Felicia's purse?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.946
Wha... Damn it.
Great looking out, Sid.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.648
* Da, da, da, da, da, da *

15:48.681 --> 15:50.717
* Da, da, da, da,
da, da... *

15:50.750 --> 15:54.721
Oh, Hank,
I hate to have to tell you this,

15:54.754 --> 15:56.956
but Felicia's been lying to you.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.959
Damn it, woman,
I told you, stay out of this.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.428
Let me be happy.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.630
We found this sonogram
in her purse.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.265
She's pregnant, Hank.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.234
She's trying to trap you
with the baby

16:07.267 --> 16:08.635
and take all your money.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.970
Oh, my God.

16:11.004 --> 16:14.307
Hey, lady, I said seven.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.908
These are nines.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.311
Get it together, Margaret.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.889
I can't believe
Felicia's pregnant.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.560
I just had to date
a 45-year-old.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.963
Well, Hank, if you're gonna fly
that close to the sun,

16:36.996 --> 16:39.966
you got to wear sunscreen.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.768
CHARLIE: Well,
you should have come with me

16:41.801 --> 16:43.170
the day I got snipped.
(chuckles)

16:43.203 --> 16:46.005
They were doing two-for-one.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.807
SID:
Apologies.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.877
I got pulled
into some rink drama.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.413
Avery's a good egg,
but she's lashing out

16:53.446 --> 16:56.716
because-- surprise, surprise--
there's trouble at home.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.553
Sid, Felicia's pregnant.
She's baby-trapping Hank.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.291
Oh, Hank. I am so sorry.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.926
Can a 45-year-old
even have a baby?

17:06.959 --> 17:09.028
I don't know a ton
about pregnancy.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.663
Yes, it is absolutely possible.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.299
Mm.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.335
And I assume the baby
comes out older, too?

17:17.670 --> 17:20.240
-No?
-This can't be happening.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.243
I can't have my golden years
filled with crying and fussing.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.877
Well, think about it, Hank.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.646
When the kid is old enough
to go off to college,

17:26.679 --> 17:29.048
you'll only be... 86.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.851
That is so old.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.555
I knew deep down
she was out of my league.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.624
I mean, why else
would I be fronting to her?

17:37.657 --> 17:38.825
I'm a fool.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.361
A sad, fertile fool.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.532
Just out here, putting babies
all up in people.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.501
Go ahead, Margaret, say it.
You were right.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.204
I'm sorry, Hank.
This really sucks.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.973
Hank, we want you to know
we're here for you.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.376
Well, I just need to hear
Felicia own up to this.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.910
I'm-a march
right across this room

17:57.944 --> 17:59.346
and give her a piece of my mind.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.282
(grunting)
Whoa. Well, forget that.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.783
Hey, Felicia!

18:03.816 --> 18:05.552
Hey.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.719
W-What are you guys doing here?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.756
(stammers)
Me... You...

18:09.789 --> 18:12.725
Problem... Diapers?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.761
H-Hank, take a deep breath.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.564
You know you babble
when you get too mad.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.332
(panting):
You took a skate scamming.

18:19.366 --> 18:24.003
What... How often? Never?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.373
Hank, are you okay?

18:26.406 --> 18:29.876
Wait, what is she doing
with my purse?

18:29.909 --> 18:31.244
What the hell?

18:31.278 --> 18:33.079
I know you're pregnant.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.681
You never cared about my heart.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.116
All you cared about
was my bank account.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.051
Are you insane?

18:39.085 --> 18:41.053
Oh, so that's the plan.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.523
You're gonna have me
declared insane.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.693
And guess who gets
all my baseball cards?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.695
Suddenly, who's sitting
on a pile of mint condition

18:48.728 --> 18:51.063
Ken Griffey Jr.'s,
I'm on Shutter Island.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.065
I don't know, Felicia.
You tell me.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.969
Am I insane?

18:58.238 --> 18:59.639
Yes!

18:59.672 --> 19:02.942
This is my dog's sonogram, Hank.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.278
Yeah, nice try. Dog sonogram.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.315
What's next? What, seagulls
getting their blood pressure?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.950
(whispers indistinctly)

19:10.983 --> 19:15.087
I have, uh, just been informed
that dogs do get sonograms.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.924
Yeah.
I had to take my dog to the vet

19:17.957 --> 19:19.926
because he ate
a pair of cuff links.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.761
Cuff links that I bought
for you.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.567
Just to be clear,
I did say there was a small,

19:27.600 --> 19:31.271
small, small chance
I could be wrong.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.948
Good, you're still here.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.350
Of course I am.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.519
I can't get out
of these stupid skates.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.189
And do you know why there's
a Monopoly token in my purse?

19:52.225 --> 19:53.993
So, we cool?

19:54.026 --> 19:57.264
No, Hank, we are not cool.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.031
How could you think
I was scamming you?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.434
Well, look at me,
and look at you.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.102
You're smart, you're sexy.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.204
You could have any guy you want.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.541
Hey, for the record,
I genuinely like older men.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.377
Single guys my age are obsessed

20:10.410 --> 20:12.379
with their careers
and sports cars.

20:12.412 --> 20:16.048
Well, the good news is
I don't have a job

20:16.082 --> 20:19.051
and I drive a golf cart.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.921
Look, I'm sorry my friends
got me all riled up

20:21.954 --> 20:23.890
and I jumped to conclusions.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.358
The truth is

20:25.392 --> 20:28.194
I can't dance,
I can't roller skate

20:28.227 --> 20:30.597
and I live
in a retirement community.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.199
And I really like you.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.201
And I really like you, too.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.069
I don't care about
where you live.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.071
Listen, I'm sorry
I screwed things up.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.374
Do you think
you could forgive me

20:41.408 --> 20:43.310
and we could give this
a fresh start?

20:43.343 --> 20:45.312
Sure.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.681
-But this time, let's be
honest with each other.
-Mm.

20:48.715 --> 20:52.352
-And I'm still taking
your old ass dancing.
-(laughs)

20:52.385 --> 20:54.754
Well, just long as you
ice me down the next day.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.389
(both laugh)

20:56.423 --> 20:57.990
Oh, and your friends are crazy.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.992
Yeah, we're never hanging out
with them again.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.998
Here's to single Hank.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.101
-Ha, ha!
-To single Hank.
-(laughs)

21:09.135 --> 21:11.571
I kind of thought you guys
were gonna work it out.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.606
I can't believe
you broke up with her.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.475
I don't need Felicia
to make me feel young.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.276
That's what
I got you freaks for.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.978

she had a trampoline.
