A NETFLIX SERIES

00:07.480 --> 00:09.840
<i>What is arousal?</i>

00:10.480 --> 00:13.720
According to Masters and Johnson,
arousal is the first stage

00:13.800 --> 00:17.240
of the sexual system's natural reaction.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.480
<i>There's arousal,</i>

00:21.240 --> 00:23.080
<i>followed by a plateau phase,</i>

00:24.440 --> 00:25.520
<i>the orgasm,</i>

00:27.240 --> 00:28.680
<i>and a recovery phase.</i>

00:30.360 --> 00:34.280
<i>The sexual system</i>
<i>is activated by way of a stimulus.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:37.560
<i>In animals, this is mostly by scent.</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:42.320
<i>Humans, however,</i>
<i>can be aroused via multiple senses.</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:44.760
<i>A caress,</i>

00:46.360 --> 00:47.240
<i>an image,</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:49.360
<i>a memory.</i>

00:50.640 --> 00:51.600
<i>Or a fantasy.</i>

00:53.040 --> 00:59.960
<i>And this differs from one person</i>
<i>to the next, to the next.</i>

01:01.360 --> 01:04.400
But it also differs
depending on the situation.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.080
The caress of a loved one

01:06.680 --> 01:09.640
can be arousing, while the same caress

01:10.720 --> 01:12.960
from a stranger can feel like a threat.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.920
<i>It therefore depends</i>

01:16.520 --> 01:20.200
<i>on the meaning</i>
<i>our brain attributes to this stimulus.</i>

01:30.400 --> 01:32.520
For next time, read the chapter

01:32.600 --> 01:35.720
about the differences
between male and female arousal.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.600
One more thing.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.960
I'm looking for test subjects
for a research project

01:43.600 --> 01:46.960
here in the sex lab at the college.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.040
You'll receive financial compensation
and course credits.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.360
-Janna, no.
-Yes, you need the money.

01:58.120 --> 02:02.240
<i>Now that I'd been kicked out</i>
<i>by my parents, I needed every penny.</i>

02:02.320 --> 02:05.440
<i>It was made</i>
<i>painfully clear to me that morning.</i>

02:06.400 --> 02:09.320
Don't be scared. I'm good people.
Are you Marly?

02:09.400 --> 02:10.440
Yes, I am.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.320
Hijman Blumfeld. The landlord.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.120
Hi. Hello.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.680
-Haven't we met before?
-No.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.880
<i>Yes, I'd heard that a lot</i>
<i>since I'd been on TV.</i>

02:27.440 --> 02:31.480
<i>Of course, there was no catch-up TV</i>
<i>or YouTube in those days.</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:33.560
<i>Nothing could go viral.</i>

02:33.640 --> 02:37.040
<i>But it didn't need to because</i>
<i>there were only two Dutch TV channels.</i>

02:37.120 --> 02:41.080
<i>So everyone,</i>
<i>and I mean everyone, had seen it.</i>

02:45.600 --> 02:47.400
No. Not that I know of.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.080
I swear I know you
from somewhere. Anyway, I

02:52.360 --> 02:55.680
came to drop off the rental agreement.
You can sign it.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.760
-Do I need to do it now?
-Don't be silly, no.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.520
-You can drop it round later.
-Okay.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.880
Along with the deposit.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.280
The deposit?

03:05.960 --> 03:07.360
Three months' rent.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.800
-Nine hundred guilders?
-There's no rush.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.760
If you have it by the end of the month,
then it'll all be fine.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.680
Okay.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.200
You better get dressed
before you catch a cold.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.760
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>where I was going to get 900 guilders.</i>

03:24.440 --> 03:27.760
<i>But a guinea pig in a sex lab</i>
<i>would have been my last guess.</i>

03:27.840 --> 03:29.520
What is a sex lab?

03:32.600 --> 03:35.240
Ladies. I appreciate you volunteering.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.880
-I would like to know--
-How much it pays.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.840
I'm researching visual stimuli

03:41.920 --> 03:44.080
and the difference
between sexual sensation in--

03:44.160 --> 03:45.280
I'm not having sex.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.640
<i>Did I just say that out loud? Yes.</i>

03:47.720 --> 03:50.680
It's great that
you're setting boundaries, Ms…

03:50.760 --> 03:51.800
Salomon.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.800
-Salomon.
-Marly.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.480
I wouldn't dream
of asking my students to do that.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.120
<i>But if he was taking part…</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:02.400
All that happens
is we show you a porn clip

04:02.480 --> 04:05.880
and ask you
to answer a number of questions.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.960
And the payment
is a ten-guilder book voucher.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.720
Another 890 guilders to go.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.440
Can't you ask your parents for a loan?

04:15.960 --> 04:17.400
They're not talking to me.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.080
Maybe I should record another tape.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.120
That's only 50 guilders a pop.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.120
Plus, the PTT has shut all the lines down.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.000
-It's all your fault.
-My fault?

04:29.080 --> 04:32.520
Didn't you hear about that submarine
that went up in flames?

04:32.600 --> 04:35.760
That's just the effect
that you have on men.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.680
When they saw you on TV,
everyone got so horny

04:38.760 --> 04:40.280
that they all started calling in.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.640
-The entire exchange went down.
-Don't be crazy.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.000
You're talented. Maybe
you should try the Red Light District.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.120
That's one big sex lab too.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.760
<i>The Teledutch lines were still down</i>

04:56.840 --> 04:59.440
<i>and the bills were piling up.</i>

05:01.120 --> 05:03.160
<i>And if that wasn't enough…</i>

05:16.320 --> 05:18.560
Hey, man. You're here early.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.880
-I…
-What are you doing?

05:21.400 --> 05:22.960
Just a little morning exercise.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.760
Jesus, man. Seriously?
Did Anouk kick you out?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.400
Haven't you noticed?
We're having a crisis with the PTT.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.080
What, she kicked me out?
Don't be stupid, man.

05:38.240 --> 05:42.120
-Honey, I'd never humiliate you.
-Liar! You're a liar!

05:42.200 --> 05:46.280
-That's not true, Poekie.
-You said you got your sperm tested.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.920
But I did go there.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.640
I just couldn't perform on command.
You don't come every time either.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.680
Get out!

05:53.400 --> 05:56.000
You're a liar, Frank!

05:56.080 --> 05:58.400
I've never felt so humiliated.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.000
Okay, yes. She kicked me out.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.720
So what?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.200
It's just that time of month.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.400
We'll make up
as soon as the lines are back.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.320
Natasja warned me about this.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.960
"Don't team up with Frank."

06:12.040 --> 06:14.200
"He fucks up everything he starts."

06:14.720 --> 06:15.560
She said that?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.880
Nobody has come up with the idea yet…

06:17.960 --> 06:19.240
A YEAR AND A HALF EARLIER

06:19.320 --> 06:21.240
…of people listening
to the same recording.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.240
If we get that license from the PTT,
we'll have a free hand.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.720
You also said that about VHS.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.920
-And the Lolo ball.
-Yes.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.400
Very important.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.120
This time we'll do it together.
Ramon and me.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.280
I haven't said yes yet.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.680
I haven't said yes yet.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.720
<i>He never finishes anything.</i>

06:43.320 --> 06:45.960
What he builds with his hands,
he knocks down with his ass.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.200
If I carry on with what I'm doing now,
I'll go crazy. Natas.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.040
I'd rather hang myself with those cables
than climb on one more roof.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.360
Babe.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.440
We're happy, aren't we?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.920
-I want to give you more than this.
-But…

07:16.480 --> 07:18.160
I don't need more than this.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.160
I do.

07:21.960 --> 07:22.800
I want more.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.480
I can be more.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.920
I've connected it to a car radio,
with a never-ending tape

07:32.000 --> 07:33.760
so it runs in a loop.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.360
And that's hooked up
with those 30 phone lines.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.400
They all listen to the same tape
at the same time.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.800
It's brilliant.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.200
-I knew you could do it.
-Yes.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.320
Well done, mate. Okay.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.280
-Okay.
-What are we going to put on them?

07:51.440 --> 07:54.800
Johnny has rustled up
some of his "fiancées."

08:07.000 --> 08:09.160
Okay, ladies. You can stop now.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.880
I can barely hear a thing.
It's like someone's eating a pear.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.840
Couldn't you perhaps
make a bit more noise?

08:18.120 --> 08:22.280
Come on, ladies. I just need
some more moans and dirty talk.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.160
-Yes.
-Like?

08:24.240 --> 08:27.680
Like… Well, you're the professional here.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.520
"Ah, yes. I'm your horny whore, yes."

08:33.600 --> 08:38.560
"Grab me by my horny ass. Ah, yes!
Just feel how wet my snatch is! Yes!"

08:38.640 --> 08:39.480
"Snatch?"

09:05.320 --> 09:07.040
<i>Did you feel aroused at all?</i>

09:07.560 --> 09:08.400
<i>No.</i>

09:09.960 --> 09:11.040
<i>What did you feel?</i>

09:12.040 --> 09:12.880
<i>Well…</i>

09:14.040 --> 09:15.320
<i>Annoyance.</i>

09:15.800 --> 09:16.800
<i>Boredom.</i>

09:17.600 --> 09:20.200
-Could you explain?
-I couldn't bear watching it.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.360
An ugly, fat man is lying by the pool.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.800
A tarted up lady comes along

09:25.880 --> 09:29.000
and, without him
making any effort at all to seduce her,

09:29.080 --> 09:31.360
she gets undressed
and they start doing it.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.160
How is that arousing?

09:36.680 --> 09:39.360
Was there anything
about the scene that you found arousing?

09:41.440 --> 09:42.480
<i>Yes.</i>

09:42.560 --> 09:47.480
<i>But that had nothing to do with the video</i>
<i>and everything to do with my professor.</i>

09:48.600 --> 09:50.040
<i>Without me realizing,</i>

09:50.120 --> 09:53.200
<i>my body had entered the arousal stage.</i>

09:54.080 --> 09:57.000
<i>This is exactly the same</i>
<i>for both men and women.</i>

09:57.840 --> 10:01.400
<i>The arteries responsible</i>
<i>for the blood supply dilate,</i>

10:02.040 --> 10:04.840
<i>while the veins</i>
<i>that drain the blood away constrict.</i>

10:05.480 --> 10:06.480
<i>This is called</i>

10:07.120 --> 10:08.640
<i>vasocongestion.</i>

10:11.280 --> 10:12.320
Here you go.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.040
Your book voucher.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.600
It says here
that the PTT are in breach of contract

10:22.680 --> 10:24.880
if they cut us off without notice.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.120
-Hey, presto.
-Mission accomplished.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.400
They have to honor the contract.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.600
Wait. There are also conditions
that we need to meet.

10:33.520 --> 10:38.000
<i>The PTT wanted to protect its reputation</i>
<i>as an upstanding government institution,</i>

10:38.080 --> 10:41.880
<i>so Teledutch wasn't allowed</i>
<i>to advertise on national television.</i>

10:41.960 --> 10:44.200
<i>Strictly speaking,</i>
<i>the news report wasn't an ad,</i>

10:44.280 --> 10:48.400
<i>but with overloaded emergency lines</i>
<i>and a submarine fire,</i>

10:48.480 --> 10:50.600
<i>the PTT took a different perspective.</i>

10:50.680 --> 10:54.120
-Fuck.
-We've done nothing wrong.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.960
It's their fault
if the network was overloaded.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.880
-Let's get the most expensive lawyer.
-No. That's a last resort.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.600
We must show them
what we've achieved in a year and a half.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.080
Isn't it so bizarre that guys
get turned on by such vulgar porn?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.440
And even jerk off to it?

11:14.520 --> 11:15.560
This one?

11:16.080 --> 11:17.480
No. Much shorter.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.480
Yes, better.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.440
What do you fantasize about
when you masturbate?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.240
And these? Why are they behind glass?

11:26.320 --> 11:29.720
Collector's item.
The owner says they belonged to Bowie.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.160
You're avoiding my question.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.920
These boots belonged to David Bowie?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.440
Yes, he won them.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.040
In some sort of drinking game
when Bowie was in town.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.040
Hey, are you telling me
you never paddle the pink canoe?

11:41.120 --> 11:44.480
-"Paddle the pink canoe."
-Flick the bean. Feed the pussycat.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.600
You think they're real?

11:47.680 --> 11:51.840
If you want to be a good therapist,
you need to learn to talk about sex.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.040
And to call things by their name. So,

11:55.560 --> 11:59.160
have you or haven't you
ever fed your pony?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.560
Can I try them on?

12:18.920 --> 12:20.160
What's that?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.880
<i>Okay, I may have exaggerated a little.</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:43.360
<i>But memories are like sex.</i>

12:43.440 --> 12:45.560
<i>Everything's better in your head.</i>

12:45.640 --> 12:47.480
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

12:48.520 --> 12:49.360
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.400
You're early.
We're not opening for another two weeks.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.440
-Good look, Marly.
-Oh, thank you.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.800
You too.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.320
So it worked out.
You managed to rent the place.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.320
Welcome to the revolution, baby.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.160
What The Warehouse is to Chicago,
we'll be to Amsterdam.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.400
The Warehouse?

13:06.480 --> 13:09.840
<i>The Warehouse. Okay, for your information,</i>

13:09.920 --> 13:13.280
<i>when Mischa started club RoXY,</i>
<i>disco music was as good as dead.</i>

13:13.480 --> 13:17.560
<i>But the real revolution started</i>
<i>with DJ Frankie Knuckles in Chicago.</i>

13:17.640 --> 13:20.640
<i>When he fed old disco records</i>
<i>into a computer</i>

13:20.720 --> 13:23.840
<i>and added electronic beats,</i>
<i>people called it "house."</i>

13:23.920 --> 13:26.520
<i>And when I heard that, I instantly knew</i>

13:26.600 --> 13:29.520
<i>this would be</i>
<i>the biggest sensation since rock 'n' roll.</i>

13:30.120 --> 13:31.840
<i>Yes? Is that okay?</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:34.960
My DJ booth will be here.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.280
We'll see about that.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.880
This is Alexander de Nooy.
He's my business partner and designer.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.920
Yes, some people create,
and others play records.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.360
Yeah? Alexander
doesn't really understand house yet.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.800
But he's a bit older,
so we need to give him time.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.080
Hey, do you have a job for Marly?
She could really use the money.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.920
Any hospitality experience?

14:00.720 --> 14:03.880
Yes. She worked the bar
at 't Seepaerd for years.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.640
Never heard of it.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.240
Yes, it's a bar in Diemen.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.280
-Rough joint.
-Totally.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.040
Cool. Alex, could we use an extra
pair of hands at the Silo tonight?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.160
I should think so.
You'll have to ask Ferry.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.440
What's the Silo?

14:18.520 --> 14:22.600
An abandoned warehouse in the docklands.
We're leaving at the end of the day.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.040
-We can give you a ride if you want.
-I'll come too. Double our money.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.240
Great.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.760
I'll see you tomorrow then.

14:30.840 --> 14:31.680
Boom.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.440
Tomorrow morning at half past eight,

14:34.520 --> 14:37.000
the PTT commercial management
will pay us a visit.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.480
Any ideas?

14:38.560 --> 14:39.880
-Be tough.
-They'll come here?

14:39.960 --> 14:42.560
A million-guilder claim
for every day our lines are down.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.760
Maybe we should get that lawyer
after all. Someone they know from TV.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.200
-Whose idea was it for them to come here?
-What?

14:49.240 --> 14:52.120
It's great, isn't it?
It saves us a trip to the Hague.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.560
Last year, they didn't even have
a commercial telephony department.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.400
They must have had an eye
on their bank account.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.480
They want to continue with the lines.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.360
They just don't know
whether to continue with us.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.120
The management'll check
if we're a serious business partner.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.040
-We must make a professional impression.
-Okay, no tits on the wall.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.640
Do you have a license for this?

15:31.000 --> 15:31.840
Of course not.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.000
Come on, guys. No pain, no gain.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.760
I don't care who does it
as long as it gets done.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.720
Unbelievable.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.480
Don't argue.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.000
Holy shit.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.240
What a fucking mess. Jesus.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.160
Hi.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.800
I love it.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.200
-Ferry.
-Yo.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.840
Hey, I've got Marly and Janna for you.
They'll be working at our club.

16:03.920 --> 16:04.760
Doing what?

16:06.360 --> 16:07.880
-Dancers?
-Bar.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.320
Do you know how to connect a keg?

16:13.920 --> 16:15.640
I've pulled a few pints.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.400
Nien, could you wear
something different tomorrow?

16:27.480 --> 16:29.960
What?
I wear something different every day.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.160
They want a more professional look.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.200
What's unprofessional about this?

16:34.280 --> 16:36.280
I think you always look lovely.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.200
Johnny.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.120
-Frank.
-Yes?

16:38.200 --> 16:39.480
I have to go home.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.760
Be ready tomorrow, eight o'clock sharp.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.440
-Smartly dressed. Fresh as a daisy.
-Yes, boss.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.360
Okay.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.080
And call Anouk.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.400
No worries. You look after your own girl.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.680
<i>This is Anouk's answering machine.</i>

16:59.760 --> 17:00.640
<i>And Frank's.</i>

17:00.720 --> 17:01.960
<i>And Frank's too.</i>

17:02.040 --> 17:04.320
<i>-Please leave your message after the…</i>
<i>-Beep.</i>

17:04.400 --> 17:06.000
Frankie, a quick one at 't Rijk.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.520
-A small one.
-You coming?

17:07.600 --> 17:08.440
Well…

17:08.960 --> 17:12.680
<i>Picture a night out</i>
<i>where things get terribly out of hand.</i>

17:12.760 --> 17:15.640
<i>You know, where you desperately</i>
<i>ask yourself the next morning,</i>

17:15.720 --> 17:18.600
<i>"How did it come to this?</i>
<i>Where did it go wrong?"</i>

17:19.240 --> 17:21.280
<i>All you need is these words:</i>

17:23.240 --> 17:24.280
Just the one.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.160
-Here you go.
-A mineral water too.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.720
Yes, I need to have
my wits about me in the morning.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.680
Either I'm back in business
or I go stone broke.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.240
Ah, mate.
There's always a job for you here.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.160
Just you wait.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.520
-I'll buy out you and your joint.
-Yes.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.200
That boyfriend of yours,
what does he do for a living?

17:43.280 --> 17:45.880
He's a kickboxer.
He's the champion of Noord-Holland.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.240
-Kick… Okay. Right.
-Cheers, guys. This is my last one.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.680
Wow. Hello.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.960
Oh, yes.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.360
Hey, technically speaking,
you've got carte blanche.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.680
As a temporary bachelor.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.360
Oh? Where are Tsjibbe and Robine going?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.520
If you won't, I will.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.280
Okay.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.640
Night on the town. Where are we going?

18:27.600 --> 18:29.440
-That's a secret.
-Oh, a secret?

18:32.240 --> 18:33.480
Leidseplein?

18:34.840 --> 18:37.000
-De Schakel?
-The docks.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.680
-Where's that? Next to Le Berry?
-No, the western docklands.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.400
Flyer? Okay.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.680
<i>"Shock of Daylight.</i>
DJ: Mischa Brandt. Acid house?"

18:47.760 --> 18:50.920
No, that's the boom-boom-boom music.
You don't want to go there.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.720
You should come with us.
We're going to Richter.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.600
Great for dancing, right?
I know you can feel it.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.000
-A little bit.
-Yes.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.520
-Good moves. Nice moves.
-Oh, yeah? Thanks.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.920
House party it is, then?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.040
Okay. <i>The Shock of Daylight.</i>

19:09.640 --> 19:10.600
Hey.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.440
I bet she has an ugly personality.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.000
Otherwise it wouldn't be fair.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.520
Goddamn it. What were you up to
with that girl in the back?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.840
A little pick-me-up. 100 percent legal.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.680
Is that ecstasy?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.680
I don't think that's a good idea.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.920
Tsjibbe started selling them
and he claims it's a miracle cure.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.280
One of these little guys
and you'll win over the PTT easy-peasy.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.680
<i>After all the jibes,</i>
<i>this was the moment Tsjibbe</i>

19:49.760 --> 19:52.560
<i>could take revenge on Frank and Johnny.</i>

19:53.760 --> 19:55.360
<i>He knew their weak spot.</i>

19:58.240 --> 19:59.800
<i>They couldn't say no.</i>

20:00.400 --> 20:04.640
<i>Even to their first-ever ecstasy trip.</i>

20:05.640 --> 20:08.040
The only reason Frank didn't take the test

20:08.120 --> 20:09.480
is because he's insecure.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.560
That's how men are.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.840
He just doesn't care about being a father.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.800
That's not true.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.320
Ramon? What do you think?

20:21.680 --> 20:23.680
-What?
-You say something.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.680
Yes.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.600
Hey, Anouk. Look on the bright side.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.400
Imagine if he had done the test

20:30.480 --> 20:32.320
and he had turned out to be infertile.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.040
What would you do?

20:37.280 --> 20:38.120
Thanks a lot.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.200
<i>A rapprochement between Russia</i>
<i>and the United States seems likely.</i>

20:41.280 --> 20:45.160
<i>The question is whether both parties</i>
<i>will manage to give each other the sense</i>

20:45.240 --> 20:47.360
<i>that there's no winner or loser,</i>

20:47.440 --> 20:49.760
<i>but that both have something to gain.</i>

20:49.840 --> 20:51.520
<i>The biggest mistake they can make</i>

20:51.600 --> 20:55.320
<i>is not taking the opponent's interests</i>
<i>into consideration when…</i>

21:05.840 --> 21:08.640
Guys, has there ever been
a more powerful statement

21:08.720 --> 21:10.360
against the hunt for baby seals?

21:11.080 --> 21:13.400
I only know the way to here.
This is as far as I go.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.520
"Dear boy, it's okay to love your friend."

21:16.600 --> 21:19.560
-Yes, she sings that in "Listen, Anita."
-Thank you.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.800
Has there ever been a more powerf--

21:24.560 --> 21:28.480
Guys, has there ever been
a more powerful statement of love?

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
I can hear it now. Come on.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.480
Frank.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.200
It's Ramon. Could you please pick up?

21:42.280 --> 21:44.920
I want to discuss something
before tomorrow's negotiations.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.560
Frank.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.640
He'll take the test, believe me.

21:54.720 --> 21:58.400
But I don't trust him anymore.
I don't know where I stand with him.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.120
No, I'll… Ramon will also

22:01.040 --> 22:03.080
talk to Frank and make sure that…

22:03.600 --> 22:06.640
-<i>Grand Café 't Rijk, Tsjibbe speaking.</i>
-Hey, Tsjibbe. It's Ramon.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.720
-Is Frank there? I don't think so, but…
-<i>He just left.</i>

22:09.800 --> 22:11.480
Of course. Glad to hear it.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.000
<i>Yes, he's gone to a house party.</i>

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
A house party?

22:39.440 --> 22:41.280
-I'll look for Robine.
-Okay.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.560
We'll look for the bar!

22:43.640 --> 22:46.440
I think everything's wonderful.
Just wonderful.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.520
Has the Singer With No Name
ever made a statement against racism?

22:57.920 --> 23:01.200
That one's shaken up. Disconnect it
and take it away. New ones are there.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.600
Okay.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.080
Close the tap, squeeze it,
take out the old keg, grab a new one…

23:09.120 --> 23:13.160
And then do the same thing but in reverse.
Come on, babe. Get a move on.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.000
Goddamn it. Fuck. Frank, man.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.400
Frank, you dickhead.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.800
Come on, babe. Get a move on.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.520
If he calls me babe one more time,
I'll punch him in the face.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.440
Hey, you made it.

24:35.040 --> 24:35.880
Yes.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.400
I came especially for you.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.880
Frank.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.440
-Hey, little brother. So good to see you.
-Come on.

24:48.040 --> 24:49.320
No, let's dance.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.120
Tomorrow, half past eight. The PTT, Frank.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.480
Where's Robine?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.560
-Who?
-Robine.

24:59.480 --> 25:00.440
She's beautiful.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.600
More beautiful than Natasja.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.440
Why are you saying Natasja?
You mean Anouk.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.440
Anouk is beautiful.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.760
But not as beautiful as Natasja.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.520
<i>Oh yeah, what I should have told you</i>

25:14.600 --> 25:17.480
<i>is that Natasja,</i>
<i>long before she started dating Ramon,</i>

25:17.560 --> 25:19.680
<i>had a long-term relationship with Frank.</i>

25:20.320 --> 25:22.680
<i>And as it so often is with first loves,</i>

25:23.280 --> 25:25.040
<i>you never completely forget them.</i>

25:33.240 --> 25:34.720
Does this actually turn you on?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.440
Hey, Natas. We're working here.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.120
-Could you please…
-What? Go back to the kitchen?

25:39.720 --> 25:41.120
Okay, Natas does have a point.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.560
-It's rubbish.
-But…

25:45.600 --> 25:47.760
Why did you get a whore to do this?

25:48.600 --> 25:49.920
It's only a tape.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.200
Here, you're going to need it.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.880
-Yeah?
-Yeah, all set.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.960
It's getting dark.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.520
We sneak off,

26:14.200 --> 26:15.960
away from the garden party.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.000
Me first, and then you.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.520
Nobody can know.

26:22.760 --> 26:23.800
I wait for you

26:24.520 --> 26:26.080
at the back of the house, and

26:26.800 --> 26:29.360
you startle me when you suddenly appear.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.600
Across the country road, among the reeds,

26:34.160 --> 26:35.240
is a small jetty.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.360
You lie down on the jetty on your back.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.880
And I unzip your trousers.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.800
I stand over you and

26:47.520 --> 26:49.400
pull up my dress,

26:49.480 --> 26:51.080
move my knickers to the side,

26:51.680 --> 26:54.400
and take your tasty,

26:55.280 --> 26:56.880
rock-hard dick.

27:00.520 --> 27:05.200
I can feel it throbbing,
and I rub it against my wet pussy.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.240
You grab my butt cheeks
and pull them apart.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.840
I lower myself onto you
and feel your hot dick

27:14.680 --> 27:18.280
slide inside me,
and I feel it getting even harder.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.400
I ride you like a pony,

27:24.000 --> 27:25.160
harder and harder.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.480
Yes.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.240
I want to scream,
but I'm scared they'll hear us.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.040
You put your hand over my mouth

27:36.120 --> 27:39.080
and fuck me even deeper and harder.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.200
And harder and harder. I'm coming!

27:44.280 --> 27:46.160
Fuck me!

27:47.840 --> 27:51.360
Yes! I'm coming!

28:00.440 --> 28:01.640
Custard, anyone?

28:05.320 --> 28:06.600
That wasn't half bad.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.880
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Whoa.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.080
-Could I get a beer?
-Mate, you're bleeding.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.120
Ferry, do we have a first aid kit?

28:18.840 --> 28:20.720
Not at the bar. Get him out of here.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.080
Why don't you come with me?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.600
Ow. Fuck. Damn it.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.320
Goddamn it.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.720
Fuck.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.000
Here. Do it yourself.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.880
Yes.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.920
Ah, Johnny!

29:47.840 --> 29:48.680
I know you.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.120
-No.
-Yes, I know you.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.800
Hey.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.680
Where have you guys come from?

30:01.240 --> 30:03.920
Hey. I know you.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.120
See?

30:05.200 --> 30:08.400
You're Marly
and you recorded a tape for us.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.800
I knew it.

30:09.880 --> 30:13.520
The girl from the Horny Student line. Yes.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.440
Thanks for nothing.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.280
What have I done now?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.480
You filmed me without asking.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.720
Now everyone thinks
I'm that horny student.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.600
-I think you're pretty hot.
-So do I.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.600
My parents kicked me out of the house.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.360
And if I don't have 900 guilders
by the end of the month,

30:31.440 --> 30:33.120
I'll lose my room too.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.960
That sucks. Hey.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.520
That sucks. Sorry.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.800
That's so sad.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.880
You know what? Forget it.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.840
Hey, gorgeous.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.480
My name's Marly.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.400
Marly.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.440
I'm Frank.

30:55.000 --> 30:55.840
Here.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.400
<i>My mother used to say,</i>

30:57.480 --> 31:00.440
<i>"If you want to be happy,</i>
<i>you need to earn a lot of money."</i>

31:00.520 --> 31:01.640
Okay? For you.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.840
<i>That's nonsense, of course.</i>

31:04.880 --> 31:07.880
Is there anything else I can do for you?

31:07.960 --> 31:10.960
<i>But I'd also realized</i>
<i>that having no money at all</i>

31:11.040 --> 31:12.720
<i>won't make you happy either.</i>

31:12.800 --> 31:14.280
I'm looking for a job.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.680
I'm sure we can help. John?

31:16.760 --> 31:17.920
We'll find you something.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.240
<i>As long as I wouldn't need</i>
<i>to record anymore tapes.</i>

31:21.320 --> 31:23.320
I read somewhere that dogs

31:23.400 --> 31:25.240
can only see black and white.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.160
But your sense of smell is better,

31:27.240 --> 31:30.400
so you see the world
totally different from--

31:30.480 --> 31:32.160
-Ronnie.
-Hey.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.640
-Hey, Ramon.
-Ronnie, you've got to help me.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.720
Who would you say is the best
protest singer in the Netherlands?

31:38.800 --> 31:39.960
-Huh?
-Well?

31:40.840 --> 31:42.320
What did you smoke, man?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.400
The Singer With No Name. Mary Servaes.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.720
-Let me tell you why.
-Goddamn it, Ronnie.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.240
Ten years before U2,
she was singing "When Irish Children Cry."

31:56.680 --> 31:57.520
Hey.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.680
Come to pick another fight?

32:05.000 --> 32:05.840
No.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.240
-I need to go.
-Oh. What a shame.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.520
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.200
Exciting.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.320
Here.

32:45.800 --> 32:46.640
Four beers.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.040
-You were right.
-What?

33:05.760 --> 33:06.880
About the revolution.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.720
-You were right.
-Wait.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.560
If you really want to feel what I mean…

33:21.240 --> 33:25.240
-Okay. This lever down and this one up.
-Okay.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.160
Okay?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.200
Have you come to say hello?

34:07.440 --> 34:10.600
If you walk away now,
everything will stay the same.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.920
And if I don't?

34:29.200 --> 34:30.840
Everything will change.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.920
Hey, babe. Where've you been?

35:03.880 --> 35:06.760
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>everything's better in your head.</i>

35:06.840 --> 35:09.560
-You need to get a new keg.
-Actually, I've had enough.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.520
-What?
-I've found a new job.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.000
<i>That night, we all witnessed</i>

35:29.080 --> 35:31.440
<i>the birth of a new era.</i>

35:34.040 --> 35:37.720
<i>While my friends were getting acquainted</i>
<i>with the new aspirin of the '80s,</i>

35:38.240 --> 35:39.800
<i>I experienced a natural high.</i>

35:44.000 --> 35:46.840
<i>Together, we slid</i>
<i>along a delicious rollercoaster,</i>

35:46.920 --> 35:49.160
<i>which flung us through the night.</i>

35:51.920 --> 35:55.120
<i>Desires which some of us</i>
<i>preferred to keep hidden</i>

35:55.200 --> 35:58.360
<i>floated to the surface and were fulfilled.</i>

36:00.200 --> 36:01.840
Come to the roof with me.

36:08.680 --> 36:12.080
<i>The collective buzz</i>
<i>lifted us to giddy heights</i>

36:12.160 --> 36:14.000
<i>free from shame or fear.</i>

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Come back.

36:21.440 --> 36:25.240
<i>Until the first rays of sunlight</i>
<i>brought the fairytale to an end…</i>

36:28.280 --> 36:31.080
<i>and we saw each other</i>
<i>for who we really were.</i>

36:31.160 --> 36:32.800
Don't do it! Frank!

36:39.600 --> 36:41.600
Frank!

36:44.880 --> 36:46.200
Frank!

36:51.800 --> 36:52.880
Is that Frank?

36:58.000 --> 36:58.840
Frank?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.680
<i>You lie down on the jetty on your back…</i>

37:08.760 --> 37:10.400
<i>and I unzip your trousers.</i>

37:12.400 --> 37:13.800
<i>I stand over you and…</i>

37:13.880 --> 37:15.000
So, is it working?

37:15.080 --> 37:16.280
<i>…pull up my dress…</i>

37:16.360 --> 37:20.000
Well, when someone phones in,
the light flashes. This isn't right.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.080
<i>…tasty, rock-hard dick.</i>

37:24.160 --> 37:26.000
-Is it the right number?
-Yes.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.720
Here.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.120
SEX-O-PHONE

37:29.200 --> 37:30.040
Yes, it's right.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.080
<i>…against my wet pussy.</i>

37:32.160 --> 37:34.080
Maybe we should reboot?

37:34.160 --> 37:36.240
<i>…you grab my butt cheeks</i>
<i>and pull them apart.</i>

37:39.160 --> 37:40.200
What's going on?

37:40.280 --> 37:44.920
<i>I lower myself onto you</i>
<i>and feel your hot dick slide inside me…</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:47.560
-Pull it out again.
-Wait.

37:51.440 --> 37:55.200
<i>I ride you like a pony, harder and harder.</i>

37:55.800 --> 37:56.640
<i>Yes.</i>

38:01.000 --> 38:01.960
Hello?

38:03.680 --> 38:06.800
<i>Hello, is this the sex-o-phone?</i>

38:08.320 --> 38:09.880
You know why they're not flashing?

38:09.960 --> 38:10.800
<i>Hello?</i>

38:10.880 --> 38:12.840
They're constantly busy.

38:16.320 --> 38:21.120
Thirty callers,
24 hours a day, seven days a week?

38:21.200 --> 38:23.080
We're rich!

38:33.800 --> 38:38.000
Here you go. Coffee, sugar, milk, cookies.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.880
Let's get down to business.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.240
About the shutdown of your 06 lines,

38:46.320 --> 38:48.480
I've been in direct contact

38:48.560 --> 38:50.920
with the Ministry of Transport
and Water Management,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.280
which the PTT reports under,

38:53.920 --> 38:58.760
and on behalf of the Minister
and the PTT's own management board,

38:59.280 --> 39:01.480
I'd like to offer our sincere apologies.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.880
The fact that the fire service
was not reachable

39:06.960 --> 39:10.120
due to the sudden popularity
of your telephone service

39:10.200 --> 39:12.520
is entirely our responsibility.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.480
That's why I've come in person
to make you an offer.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.400
Good luck.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.560
How many lines
did he just say we were getting?

39:28.640 --> 39:29.960
<i>What we would like to suggest</i>

39:30.040 --> 39:32.800
is that we connect you directly
to our Rotterdam hub.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.800
Leasing the line
would avoid the need to reroute,

39:36.880 --> 39:40.600
and instead of five cents,
you'd pocket 25 cents per minute.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.160
We also think it's only fair,
given the success of your lines,

39:44.240 --> 39:47.960
that we increase capacity
from 20 to 300 lines.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.840
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

42:15.320 --> 42:17.440
<i>Oh, yeah, harder. Oh, yeah.</i>

42:20.680 --> 42:22.560
<i>Oh, yeah, hard.</i>

42:22.640 --> 42:23.800
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

42:25.520 --> 42:26.560
<i>Harder!</i>

42:27.760 --> 42:28.960
<i>So good.</i>

42:35.520 --> 42:36.640
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

42:38.400 --> 42:40.360
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

42:40.440 --> 42:43.440
