00:26.200 --> 00:28.332
- That was beautiful.
Thank you, thank you!

00:28.376 --> 00:29.899
Thank you!
It's very beautiful.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.597
- Enough for the thank yous.
We can eat the cake now.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.252
- Not so fast!
She's gotta make her wish!

00:35.296 --> 00:36.688
Right, dear?
- Of course!

00:36.732 --> 00:38.081
- [Woman 1]:
Make a wish!

00:38.125 --> 00:39.561

Make it good!

[Laughing]

00:47.134 --> 00:49.092
- Welcome to 25, Lindsay.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.876
- No, no, no!
Don't say it!

00:50.920 --> 00:52.878
It's too close
to the big 3-0.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.184
I wanna make a toast!

00:54.228 --> 00:56.404
To everybody who
helped put together

00:56.447 --> 00:57.622
this wonderful party!

00:57.666 --> 00:58.971
To my dear brother Joey.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.800
Enjoy that fat and
sugar while you can.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.628
- To Abby.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.239
I know we just
met at work,

01:05.282 --> 01:08.198
but I know we're gonna be
the dearest of friends.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.809
To my mom. Thank you for
not forgetting the date...

01:10.853 --> 01:11.984
[All laughing]

01:12.028 --> 01:14.291
...and for bringing
the recyclable forks,

01:14.335 --> 01:17.468
because you know how much
I care about the environment.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.122
And to my
oldest friend, Dave.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.211
- Whoa, whoa!
Not so fast!

01:21.255 --> 01:22.734
We are the same age.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.954
- Thank you for always
being there for me.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.216
Cheers!

01:26.260 --> 01:28.740
- [All]: Cheers!

01:28.784 --> 01:30.786
[Laughing]

01:30.829 --> 01:32.657
[All talking, indistinct]

01:32.701 --> 01:35.007
- [Woman]: Bye!

01:35.051 --> 01:37.749
- You, uh,
looking for Linds?

01:37.793 --> 01:38.750
- Yeah.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.317
- She went to her room.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.233
You finally gonna
tell her how you feel?

01:43.277 --> 01:46.018
What's taking so long?
- It's not that simple, Joey.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.239
If I tell her how I feel
and she's not interested,

01:49.283 --> 01:51.589
we could lose our
friendship forever.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.200
It means the
world to me.

01:55.071 --> 01:57.247
There you are!
- Hey!

01:57.291 --> 01:59.119
- People are starting to go.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.337
- Oh.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.425
- What's that?

02:01.469 --> 02:02.861
[Sighing]

02:02.905 --> 02:04.602
- OK, don't laugh!

02:04.646 --> 02:07.127
But it's my birthday wish list.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.301
Every year on my birthday,

02:08.345 --> 02:10.042
I make a wish
and I write it down.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.479
- I'm sorry.

02:11.522 --> 02:14.960
I've known you since 3rd grade,
but I didn't know that.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.137
- Well, it hasn't
helped, though.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.008
None have come true... yet.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.966
- Well, I have to see it.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.272
May I?

02:22.316 --> 02:23.534
[Inhaling deeply]

02:23.578 --> 02:25.145
- Fine!

02:25.188 --> 02:26.450
[Chuckling]

02:26.494 --> 02:28.800
- All right, let's
see what we have.

02:28.844 --> 02:29.801
"A puppy.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.847
"Fun In Play dollhouse.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.066
"My brother will
get chicken pox."

02:34.110 --> 02:35.807
- I was a vindictive kid.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.157
[Both chuckling]

02:37.200 --> 02:38.201
Oh! "Lose weight.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.335
"I'll be rescued by
Prince Charming.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.859
"Billy Maddox will fall
in love with me."

02:43.902 --> 02:45.469
- That was
from 8th grade.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.471
He was so cute!

02:47.515 --> 02:49.647
- "Perfect vision."

02:49.691 --> 02:50.996
[Sighing]

02:51.040 --> 02:53.173
"Mom and Dad will
get back together."

02:53.216 --> 02:54.739
- I'm not getting
my eyes lasered,

02:54.783 --> 02:57.438
and what kid doesn't wish
for their parents to remarry?

02:58.874 --> 03:00.832
What?

03:00.876 --> 03:04.227
- Nothing, just
your final wish.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.751
- That I'll find
my true love?

03:06.795 --> 03:09.928
I mean, a girl
can dream, can't she?

03:09.972 --> 03:11.582
- Sure!

03:11.626 --> 03:15.238
- So, none of these wishes have
come true. What does it matter?

03:15.282 --> 03:16.544
I mean, we're 25!

03:16.587 --> 03:18.241
The world is at
our fingertips!

03:18.285 --> 03:20.852
I mean, one day, I'm
gonna be a top executive

03:20.896 --> 03:22.419
at an environmental firm,

03:22.463 --> 03:26.336
and I'll be living in a big
house with the man that I love.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.252
From now on, all of my
wishes are gonna come true.

03:43.484 --> 03:46.226
- Miss Corwin?

03:46.269 --> 03:48.140
Miss Corwin?

03:50.099 --> 03:53.450
I need 20 copies by 11:00
and a refill by 10:00.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.365
[Sighing]

03:55.409 --> 03:58.542
- The day just started, and Kate
already has caffeine withdrawal?

03:58.586 --> 03:59.935
- Yeah.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.545
- New screensaver?
- Yeah.

04:01.589 --> 04:04.809
It's from last week. It was
our 6-month dating anniversary.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.898
Isn't he the best?

04:06.942 --> 04:09.292
Abby, I really feel
like he's the one.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.903
He's my Mr. Right.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.905
I'm so excited
about tonight.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.472
[Telephone ringing]

04:17.125 --> 04:18.954
Hello. GreenTree.
Can I help you?

04:18.997 --> 04:21.261
Oh, you have a great
product for us?

04:21.303 --> 04:23.480
An indoor bathroom
for dogs.

04:23.524 --> 04:27.397
Send us the information.
I'll pass it along to Ms. Moore.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.661
OK, have a nice day.

04:30.705 --> 04:34.012
I swear, one more green
dog idea, and I'm out of here.

04:34.056 --> 04:37.494
- You're gonna get an answer
on your project from Kate today?

04:37.538 --> 04:38.930
- What does it even matter?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.671
- Of course it will matter!

04:40.715 --> 04:42.456
I mean, you just found
a great product

04:42.499 --> 04:45.110
that's gonna save the planet
and get you a promotion.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.808
- We've been
assistants for 5 years.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.331
When has one of our own moved up

04:48.375 --> 04:50.768
to a life not chained
to these fake wooden desks?

04:50.812 --> 04:52.814
- These aren't real wood?

04:52.857 --> 04:54.294
How about
some cheering up?

04:54.337 --> 04:56.121
Let's get
together tonight.

- Tonight?
OK, all right!

04:59.647 --> 05:00.865
I'll play along.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.432
I'm going to my
mom's for dinner,

05:02.476 --> 05:04.347
and then I'm going to Kevin's.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.522
- Play along with what?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.350
- It's 3 days before
my 30th birthday,

05:07.394 --> 05:09.352
and no one's said anything
about a party.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.833
Kevin's acting super weird.
He's up to something.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.444
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.317
- I'll be embarrassed when
Kevin jumps out and yells...

05:21.364 --> 05:23.279
Kevin?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.252
- Lindsay!

You're--you're early.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.430
[Gasping]

05:44.735 --> 05:46.346
This isn't what
it looks like.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.045
OK, it is what
it looks like.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.481
[Sighing]

05:51.525 --> 05:52.743
I'm sorry!

05:52.787 --> 05:55.180
What do you
want me to say?

05:55.224 --> 05:56.747
[Hands hitting thighs]

05:56.791 --> 05:58.749
- Surprise?

05:58.793 --> 06:01.926
But I guess that'll
have to be my line.

[Doorbell ringing]

06:45.100 --> 06:47.885
- Dave Landry,
legal eagle and chauffeur,

06:47.929 --> 06:49.365
at your service.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.760
We're taking my car, right?
Yours is still in the shop?

06:52.803 --> 06:54.414
- Yeah, when isn't it?

06:54.457 --> 06:56.416
- So, did you get an answer

06:56.459 --> 06:58.418
on our solar-panel
project yet?

06:58.461 --> 06:59.897
The company's asking.

06:59.941 --> 07:03.292
I told them, as their lawyer,
I can only do so much.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.728
- No, not yet. I'm just...

07:04.772 --> 07:07.296
They're waiting for
the right time, you know?

07:07.339 --> 07:10.778
- Oh. Is, uh,
everything all right?

07:10.821 --> 07:13.128
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.652
- You sure?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.743
- No, I'm not.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.963
Kevin and I broke up.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.139
- Oh, Lindsay!

07:24.182 --> 07:26.576
- He was cheating on me.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.925
- I'm sorry.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.492
You wanna talk about it?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.451
- I'm just--
I'm done with men!

07:31.494 --> 07:32.800
They're all dogs.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.455
Well, present
company excluded.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.847
- Well, thank you.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.110
You realize there are
different kinds of dogs--

07:39.154 --> 07:41.112
lap dogs, guard dogs,
working dogs.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.159
You, however, always seem
to end up with hound dogs.

07:44.202 --> 07:45.290
[Chuckling]

07:45.334 --> 07:47.292
- You always know
how to make me laugh.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.293
- Yeah?- Thank you.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.469
[Ringing]

07:49.512 --> 07:50.513
Sorry.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.734
Hey, Mom!
You at the airport?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.476
Yes, don't worry.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.522
I will survive my birthday
without you, I promise.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.830
Have fun in Mexico, OK?
Go easy on the cheese nachos.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.353
I love you.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.051
At least she still travels.

08:07.095 --> 08:10.228
Her and my dad rotate vacations
at the timeshare every year.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.231
- Still not talking?
- Are you kidding?
They're polar opposites.

08:13.275 --> 08:16.365
Talking about dogs, it's like
putting a little, fluffy poodle

08:16.408 --> 08:18.715
with a big
slobbering St. Bernard.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.501
[Telephone ringing]

08:21.544 --> 08:23.198

the call last night.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.380
[Sighing]

08:31.423 --> 08:34.383
- I don't wanna say I told
you so, but I told you so!

08:34.426 --> 08:37.647
Why do you keep going out
with these hot-looking jerks?

08:37.691 --> 08:40.041
- I don't know. Is that
a trick question?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.826
- It's like you have
this list of ingredients

08:42.870 --> 08:44.087
for your perfect guy,

08:44.131 --> 08:45.089
and guess what?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.351
It's the wrong list.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.005
- Abby, this isn't helping!

08:48.049 --> 08:50.225
I need a cheerleader,
not Dr. Phil.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.532
- You need to start
dating men who cherish you,

08:52.575 --> 08:55.012
not talk a great game
but aren't worth your time.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.013
What about Dave?

08:56.057 --> 08:57.711
- Dave? My Dave?

08:57.754 --> 09:01.366
No, we've known each other
since we were little kids.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.672
He's like my brother.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.109
I mean, he's an amazing guy.
He's super sweet.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.198
I just don't feel it
with him, you know?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.897
- Or you won't let yourself
feel it with him

09:09.940 --> 09:11.159
because it's too scary.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.772
- Right there
on the left!

09:15.816 --> 09:17.208
- There's nowhere
to put it!

09:17.252 --> 09:18.383
- OK, all right.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.603
Now, use your leg
strength, not your arms.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.648
- I can't do it.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.693
- Yes, you can!
You're almost there!

09:23.737 --> 09:25.129
- Ah!- You got it.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.391
- Ah!- See?

09:26.435 --> 09:28.306
So? Great birthday
present, huh?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.787
I've been wanting to
get you out here forever.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.746
You love the outdoors,
you're sporty,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.922
and you never shy
away from a challenge.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.315
- Yeah, not one that
involves a parachute!

09:37.359 --> 09:39.056
- Looking good
for your first time!

09:39.100 --> 09:42.233
Dave started me climbing
a few months ago. I'm hooked!

09:42.277 --> 09:44.061
It's a great way
to tone your legs.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.236
Right, sweetheart?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.195
- Right!

09:48.500 --> 09:50.807
- Hey! Dave!
Dave Landry!

09:50.851 --> 09:52.069
- Cliff!

I'm the next Julia Child.

29:06.614 --> 29:07.789
- [Both]: Hmm!

29:07.833 --> 29:09.573
- And feast your eyes

29:09.617 --> 29:13.403
On your new luxury,
top-of-the-line SUV.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.144
- Oh, I can't drive that!

29:15.188 --> 29:18.408
I work for one of the top
environmental firms in the city.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.933
That's a gas-guzzling
monster car.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.805
It probably gets
10 miles a gallon downhill.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.895
- Well, you can't
return the prizes,

29:26.939 --> 29:29.680
but there's no reason
why you can't sell it.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.291
[Sighing]

29:35.861 --> 29:37.645
[Answering machine beeping]

29:37.688 --> 29:39.647
- Hey, Joey! Pick up!

29:39.690 --> 29:42.824
Do you wanna come sleep
in my new mansion tonight?

29:42.868 --> 29:46.349
It's 475 Lakeview Terrace.
The keys are under the mat.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.525
Oh, bring the puppy!
OK. OK, bye.

29:48.569 --> 29:49.788
[Lindsay sighing]

29:53.966 --> 29:55.184
- Lindsay Corwin.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.272
- Billy!

29:56.316 --> 29:59.275
- Wow! Look at you!

29:59.319 --> 30:00.973
Oh, sit, sit!

30:01.016 --> 30:02.670
- Oh, thanks!

30:04.367 --> 30:06.848
Wow! You look great!

30:06.892 --> 30:08.154
- Oh, come on!

30:08.197 --> 30:11.461
But you! You haven't
changed a bit!

30:11.505 --> 30:13.942
I mean, you were
pretty then, but now...

30:13.986 --> 30:15.161
[Chuckling]

30:15.204 --> 30:17.685
- I never thought
that you even noticed me.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.382
- Are you kidding?

30:19.426 --> 30:21.950
I couldn't keep my
eyes off of you.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.170
You know, I really
couldn't believe my luck

30:24.213 --> 30:26.476
when I found you
on the Internet.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.870
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.698
- Wow! You're
not kidding!

30:30.741 --> 30:32.961
So, you're a doctor.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.963
- Podiatrist.- Oh!

30:35.007 --> 30:37.052
- If you got a problem
with your feet,

30:37.096 --> 30:38.662
I'm happy to take a look.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.229
- No, they're good!
They're fine!

30:40.273 --> 30:41.578
- OK!
- They're great, yeah.

30:41.622 --> 30:44.190
- I haven't married.
- Oh!

30:44.233 --> 30:48.063
- Still hanging out with
the guys from McKinley.
- Ah!

30:48.107 --> 30:50.674
- You remember Perkins?
Big glasses, squeaky voice?

30:50.718 --> 30:51.893
- Yeah!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.242
- And Feldberg always told

30:53.286 --> 30:54.504
those knock-knock jokes.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.158
- They've changed
a lot, huh?

30:56.202 --> 30:57.594
- No, why?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.075
- Oh, I...

31:00.119 --> 31:01.207
- What about you?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.687
Single? Married?

31:03.731 --> 31:05.864
- I'm single.
I work at GreenTree.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.692
It's an environmental
development company.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.391
Actually, I just got
promoted to director.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.742
- Fantastic!
Congratulations!

31:14.785 --> 31:15.874
- Thank you.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.920
So, this is so funny!

31:18.964 --> 31:20.182
[Chuckling]

31:20.226 --> 31:21.401
This is so funny!

31:21.444 --> 31:25.753
- Lindsay, I--I gotta
be honest.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.712
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.758
- Yeah, you said that.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.543
- And I know we didn't
talk a lot back then,

31:33.587 --> 31:36.633
but I always felt that
there was something there.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.634
I--I felt it.

31:37.678 --> 31:38.679
- That's funny,

31:38.722 --> 31:41.029
'cause I don't
really remember ever--

31:41.073 --> 31:43.771
- The truth is
I know it's been years,

31:43.814 --> 31:47.949
but the second that you came
through that door and I saw you,

31:47.993 --> 31:51.431
I felt like I was in
the 8th grade all over again.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.478
I mean, the feeling
is still there.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.784
- You know, Billy,

31:56.827 --> 31:59.482
you know how sometimes
people can sort of create

31:59.526 --> 32:01.397
a fantasy about
another person.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.703
- Oh yeah!

32:04.096 --> 32:06.228
- You don't really know me,

32:06.272 --> 32:09.101
so how can you have
feelings for me?

32:10.450 --> 32:12.321
[Sighing]

32:12.365 --> 32:14.933
- Yeah, I thought
this might happen.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.805
I shouldn't have
said anything.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.502
I am such an idiot!

32:19.546 --> 32:21.417
You probably hate me.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.506
- No! No, I don't
hate you, Billy. No!

32:23.550 --> 32:24.681
- You don't?

32:24.725 --> 32:25.856
- No!

32:25.900 --> 32:28.511
- So, you feel it too.

32:28.555 --> 32:30.992
Lindsay, this could
really be amazing!

32:31.036 --> 32:34.604
I think we should get
together again. Tonight!

32:34.648 --> 32:37.129
- Oh, you know what?
Oh, it's late!

32:37.172 --> 32:39.174
It's so late.
Uh, I gotta go!

32:39.218 --> 32:40.436
I'm so sorry.
I gotta go!

32:40.480 --> 32:41.785
- We haven't even ordered.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.004
- I know.
I'm so sorry!

32:43.048 --> 32:45.137
I have an early meeting,
and I'm late.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.704
But it was really good
to see you again, Billy.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.619
[Sighing]

32:49.663 --> 32:51.491
Bye.

32:54.537 --> 32:58.106
- [Dave]: So, how's the
high-school reunion going?

32:58.150 --> 33:01.153
- I mean, he was so cool
in 8th grade.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.372
The problem is he's still
in the 8th grade.

33:03.416 --> 33:07.289
I couldn't meet Mr. Right if
he hit me with a 10-foot pole.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.726
- I'll be there
in 15 minutes.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.380
- Oh no!
Oh no, that's Woodhill.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.295
He's coming towards
the parking lot.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.123
If he sees me in the car,
I am dead!

33:15.167 --> 33:16.603
I gotta go!
I gotta go! Bye!

33:20.781 --> 33:23.610
[Cars honking]

33:25.568 --> 33:26.526
[Scoffing]

33:26.569 --> 33:27.831
- Hey!

33:27.875 --> 33:29.572
- This is my spot.
Did you not see me?

33:29.616 --> 33:31.922
- You're pretty hard
to miss in that tank!

33:31.966 --> 33:33.402
OK, go ahead.
Steal my spot.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.491
You people think
you own the world.

33:35.535 --> 33:39.017
- Us people? You think
that you know me because
of the car that I drive?

33:39.060 --> 33:40.496
- Uh, yeah!
Yeah, I think I do.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.933
I think material
objects make you happy,

33:42.977 --> 33:45.153
status is more important
than anything to you

33:45.197 --> 33:47.547
and you don't give a hoot
about the environment.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.070
- Wow!

33:49.114 --> 33:52.247
That actually could not be
more of a dead-wrong statement.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.032
Let me try you.
- OK.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.859
- You only shop
at designer stores,

33:55.903 --> 33:57.557
you way overpay
for your haircuts

33:57.600 --> 33:59.515
and you drive a hybrid
so people think

33:59.559 --> 34:01.256
you're into
the environment,

34:01.300 --> 34:02.779
but clearly you
aren't at all.

34:02.823 --> 34:03.867
- Wow!- Yeah!

34:03.911 --> 34:05.260
- That's 2 out
of 3. Not bad.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.175
- Mm-hmm!
- Oh, hey!

34:07.219 --> 34:08.655
Give me a call

34:08.697 --> 34:11.223
next time you find a spot
you can't actually fit into.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.266
- I can fit.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.748
- Oh, OK! Good luck!

34:18.926 --> 34:20.101
[Scoffing]

34:25.585 --> 34:26.934
[Tires screeching]

34:29.110 --> 34:30.981
[Car honking, tires screeching]

34:31.025 --> 34:32.505
- Ugh!

34:36.248 --> 34:38.902
- [Claudia]: Good morning.
- [Lindsay]: Good morning!

34:38.946 --> 34:40.600
- Here's today's paper.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.036
- Oh, thank you!

34:44.864 --> 34:47.737
[Gasping]

34:47.781 --> 34:50.436
This is fantastic!

34:50.478 --> 34:53.786
- And this is all the
photovoltaic information

34:53.830 --> 34:55.092
you've requested.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.572
- So what's all this, then?

34:56.616 --> 34:59.140
- Oh, half of it is
getting you caught up

34:59.184 --> 35:00.837
with our current products.

35:00.881 --> 35:03.927
The rest is the usual stuff.
Budget, reports, analysis.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.494
- Do I have to
read it all?

35:05.538 --> 35:07.409
- By 11:00 a.m.
Staff meeting.

35:07.453 --> 35:08.628
Welcome to management.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.412
[Giggling, groaning]

35:10.456 --> 35:13.415
- And on page 5
of the spreadsheet,

35:13.459 --> 35:15.678
you'll find
profit projections.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.248
OK, moving to new projects.

35:20.292 --> 35:23.295
- Every division has posted
a year-over-year gain.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.861
We project more to come.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.124
- As per the memo,

35:26.167 --> 35:28.343
Mr. Woodhill will be
touring the office today

35:28.387 --> 35:31.172
with some Wall Street men
and a big investor.

35:31.216 --> 35:34.132
If we go public,
we have to deliver big time.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.525
Kate, you're making
the product recommendation

35:36.569 --> 35:38.440
to Mr. Woodhill on Friday.

35:38.484 --> 35:39.659
OK, good. So...

35:40.834 --> 35:42.488
[Renshaw chuckling]

35:42.531 --> 35:44.620
Uh, you don't need
to raise your hand.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.187
- Oh. Um, I just
wanted to say

35:46.231 --> 35:48.058
that I have
an incredible project

35:48.102 --> 35:50.060
that I would like
to present as well.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.150
It's a breakthrough
solar technology

35:52.193 --> 35:53.716
that will slash
energy costs.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.632
- I'm sorry, but it's too late
to add another presentation.

35:56.676 --> 35:59.287
The schedule's already set.
You can pitch in 6 months.

35:59.331 --> 36:00.984
So, moving on
to financial reports.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.638
- [Woodhill]:
Excuse me, Frank!

36:02.682 --> 36:05.163
Sorry to intrude.
My apologies, everyone.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.165
I'll just be
a couple of minutes.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.993
I want you all to meet
one of our newest investors

36:10.037 --> 36:11.647
who's visiting us
from Boston.

36:11.691 --> 36:14.302
Everyone, meet Reed Paulson.

36:14.346 --> 36:15.999
- Hi, everyone!

36:16.043 --> 36:17.218
- Hello.- Hi.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.654
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.830
I told Barry I'm not
just a silent investor,

36:20.874 --> 36:23.311
I'm also trying to be an
invisible one, so carry on.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.095
Keep up the good work.
Carry on.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.706
- Nonsense, nonsense!

36:26.749 --> 36:29.578
I want you to meet the people
who keep GreenTree number one.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.406
This is Gerry McClintock
in accounting.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.017
Lee Parsons, research.
- Hi!

36:34.061 --> 36:35.932
- Kate Moore,
Director of New Projects.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.238
- Hi, Kate.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.675
- Across from her
is our newest director,

36:39.719 --> 36:41.721
at least I think it is.

36:41.764 --> 36:44.332
Yes, that's Lindsay Corwin.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.247
- I actually think
that we have met.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.771
Weren't you the one
who was driving that big--

36:48.815 --> 36:51.383
- Horrible loaner car.
It was awful. It was a loaner.

36:51.426 --> 36:54.255
- Well, there'll be plenty of
time later to meet the others.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.562
Frank, I'll let you get
back to your meeting.

36:56.605 --> 36:58.955
- Mr. Woodhill,
one moment!

36:58.999 --> 37:01.697
Um, I know that your
schedule's already set

37:01.741 --> 37:03.351
for Friday's presentations,

37:03.395 --> 37:06.746
but I have something incredible
that you have to see.

37:06.789 --> 37:10.140
- Well, that's wonderful!
I like someone with passion.

37:10.184 --> 37:13.535
But I have no time, so come
to me on the next round.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.929
- With all due respect,
this can't wait.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.714
This company and
our environment can't wait.

37:18.758 --> 37:22.370
Um, GreenTree needs bold,
forward-thinking ventures

37:22.414 --> 37:24.807
in keeping with your
forward-thinking agenda

37:24.851 --> 37:28.158
to support products that will
sustain our environment

37:28.202 --> 37:29.551
for centuries to come.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.466
And I can show you
that on Friday.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.641
You won't regret it.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.426
- Well, I don't take well

37:34.469 --> 37:38.125
to people trying to force
something down my throat...

37:38.168 --> 37:39.387
[Clearing throat]

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
...unless it's for
a good cause.

37:42.869 --> 37:46.786
Frank, make some time
on Friday, will you?

37:46.829 --> 37:50.311
- So, Corwin, I want a preview
of that presentation

37:50.355 --> 37:51.921
in my office tomorrow morning.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.314
- No problem, yeah.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.056
- OK, meeting adjourned!

37:59.146 --> 38:01.191
- [Woman]:
It's unbelievable!

38:01.235 --> 38:02.323
[Cell phone dialling]

38:02.367 --> 38:03.455
- Lindsay?

38:03.498 --> 38:05.413
- Dave, I did it.
We got the pitch.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.023
It's in 2 days.
Can you make it?

38:07.067 --> 38:08.938
- Can I make it?
This is great news!

38:08.982 --> 38:10.375
Of course I can make it.

38:10.418 --> 38:12.290
- Can you meet me?
I'm gonna go for lunch.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.682
We have so much prep to do.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.815
- Shoot! I can't.
I've got an appointment.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.600
- What if you come over
to the new house after work?

38:18.644 --> 38:20.428
- Perfect.
Let's make this our dinner.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.300
We can work and
then talk afterwards.

38:22.343 --> 38:25.041
I'll bring something amazing.
Don't you lift a finger.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.129
- You are the best!

38:26.173 --> 38:27.261
Dave, I really think

38:27.305 --> 38:29.132
that this could
change things for us.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.699
- I think you're right.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.353
- Bye!

38:40.013 --> 38:41.536
[Sighing]

38:41.580 --> 38:43.321
- Excuse me.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.932
[Sighing]

38:47.368 --> 38:49.631
[Sighing]

38:49.675 --> 38:52.721
- Well, look who it is! The
tank-driving environmentalist.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.201
Hi!

38:54.244 --> 38:56.159
- Hi! Like I said,
it's not my car!

38:56.203 --> 38:57.639
- No, but it looked like

38:57.683 --> 39:00.555
you were having a
good time driving it.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.644
- No, it is a
genuine gas-guzzling,

39:02.688 --> 39:04.037
carbon-spewing
monster car.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.387
I won it in a contest,
and I'm gonna sell it.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.651
- And you were just giving it
a little test drive.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.827
- I care deeply
about the environment.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.090
It was really nice
to see you again.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.223
- Well, that makes
two of us.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.097
Do you wanna talk
some more about this?

39:21.141 --> 39:24.405
Maybe over lunch? I think
my table just opened up.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.018
[Lindsay chuckling]

39:29.062 --> 39:32.021
- It just started with one
shop in the heart of Boston,

39:32.065 --> 39:34.023
and it just spread
like wildfire.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.677
We must've been
among the first

39:35.721 --> 39:38.419
environmentally conscious
dry-cleaning businesses.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.855
And so, before I knew it,

39:39.899 --> 39:42.423
all of a sudden, it's
a $70 million business.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.425
- Wow!

39:44.469 --> 39:46.906
- And, of course,
it gave us a little freedom

39:46.949 --> 39:48.734
to do other things
like GreenTree.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.605
And well, I'm here
for the opening

39:50.649 --> 39:53.391
of the new headquarters
of a charity that I support.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.088
- So, you were
born in Boston?

39:55.131 --> 39:56.394
- Oh yeah!

39:56.437 --> 39:59.092
I just love the town,
you know, how it's modern,

39:59.135 --> 40:01.573
but yet it's also kept
its history, you know?

40:01.616 --> 40:03.052
How about you?

40:03.096 --> 40:05.098
- Uh, yeah, I was
born right here

40:05.141 --> 40:07.622
in a city that's losing
all of its history

40:07.666 --> 40:10.059
because we tear down the
beautiful buildings

40:10.103 --> 40:11.104
and put up new ones.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.888
- Some people
call that progress.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.455
- Yeah, and progress is great

40:14.499 --> 40:17.719
but as long as you don't destroy
all the beauty and the charm

40:17.763 --> 40:18.720
in the process.

40:18.764 --> 40:21.157
- Please tell me
you're not married

40:21.201 --> 40:24.073
or that you have an incurable
disease or 24-hour memory loss

40:24.117 --> 40:25.161
or something like that.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.424
- What's your name again?

40:26.467 --> 40:28.121
[Both chuckling]

40:28.164 --> 40:29.731
- OK.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.951
Listen, you know that
charity that I mentioned?

40:31.994 --> 40:34.344
Well, they have their
opening night gala tonight.

40:34.388 --> 40:35.781
I don't wanna
be presumptuous,

40:35.824 --> 40:38.000
but I would love it
if you would be my date.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.437
[Chuckling]

40:39.480 --> 40:42.004
- Lindsay?
This is a surprise!

40:42.048 --> 40:44.659
I was just passing by
and saw you here.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.096
Do you mind if
I have a seat?

40:47.140 --> 40:49.838
- Uh, kind of.

40:49.882 --> 40:51.753
[Sighing]

40:51.797 --> 40:52.754
- Hi.

40:52.798 --> 40:53.973
- Billy Maddox.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.497
- Hi! Reed Paulson.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.544
- So, how do you two
know each other?

41:00.849 --> 41:02.764
- Business associates.

41:02.808 --> 41:04.505
- Well, it's nice
to meet you.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.464
Linds and I
go way back.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.466
- Billy and I are
old school friends.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.772
We haven't seen
each other in a long time.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.166
- And suddenly,
we got back together,

41:13.209 --> 41:14.950
and boom!

41:14.994 --> 41:16.648
Like no time had past.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.519
That spark was still
there, right, hon?

41:18.563 --> 41:20.303
- Billy, what are
you talking about?

41:20.347 --> 41:22.523
- Are you two...
- Involved?

41:22.567 --> 41:23.785
[Scoffing]

41:23.829 --> 41:27.136
Ah, all I can say
is that we hit it off

41:27.180 --> 41:29.878
the second we saw
each other again.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.490
I mean, it was a
surprise for both of us.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.143
- Billy, we are not involved!

41:34.187 --> 41:35.493
- Yet!

41:35.536 --> 41:36.711
[Chuckling]

41:36.755 --> 41:38.800
We, uh, I mean,
we can't rush this.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.629
We gotta let it grow
at its own pace.

41:41.673 --> 41:45.241
- OK, I think I've gotten
in-between something here.

41:45.285 --> 41:47.330
I'm gonna go, all right?

41:47.374 --> 41:49.332
This should be enough
to cover the lunch.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.030
Billy, it was great
to have met you,

41:51.073 --> 41:53.511
and Lindsay, thank you
for a wonderful lunch.

41:53.554 --> 41:55.643
- This is not
what it looks like.

41:55.687 --> 41:58.341
- It's exactly what it
looks like. Nice to meet you.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.213
- OK.

42:03.129 --> 42:05.740
- Billy, I don't know
what your problem is,

42:05.784 --> 42:08.351
but there is nothing
going on between us.

42:08.395 --> 42:11.093
Do I make myself clear?
Do you understand that?

42:11.137 --> 42:12.442
- When you calm down...

42:12.486 --> 42:13.661
- Ugh!

42:13.705 --> 42:15.663
- ...I think that
you are going to have

42:15.707 --> 42:17.056
second thoughts
about that.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.804
[Sighing]

42:27.719 --> 42:29.547
- Reed!

42:29.590 --> 42:32.724
Reed, wait!
I am--

42:32.767 --> 42:34.552
- No, no, just wait!
Let me guess.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.597
You won him too?
Charity? Auction?

42:36.641 --> 42:38.120
- No! Let me explain.

42:38.164 --> 42:40.775
I have not seen that guy since
middle school. He's insane.

42:40.819 --> 42:43.082
There's absolutely
nothing going on between us.

42:43.125 --> 42:45.258
I think he followed
me into the restaurant.

42:45.301 --> 42:47.216
- Yeah?- Yes!

42:47.260 --> 42:50.219
Oh! Come here,
come here, come here!

42:50.263 --> 42:51.569
Ah!

42:51.612 --> 42:53.483
- Do you have
yourself a stalker?

42:53.527 --> 42:54.702
Are you
gonna be OK?

42:54.746 --> 42:56.095
- I think he's harmless.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.705
- OK, well, that's good.

42:57.749 --> 43:00.578
Listen, I just don't wanna get
in the middle of something,

43:00.621 --> 43:02.754
like with you and your
boyfriend or anything.

43:02.797 --> 43:05.583
- No! No, Billy is the last
person I would date, ever.

43:05.626 --> 43:08.586
And the answer to
your question is yes.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.804
Yeah!

43:09.848 --> 43:11.414
- Yes?

43:11.458 --> 43:12.981
- About tonight.
I would love to.

43:13.025 --> 43:14.069
- Really?

43:14.113 --> 43:15.157
- Mm-hmm!

43:15.201 --> 43:16.419
- Oh, that is perfect!

43:16.463 --> 43:18.639
Listen, I'm gonna
send a car around 7:00.

43:18.683 --> 43:20.902
I'll have my assistant
call your office.

43:20.946 --> 43:22.164
- Great!- Good!

43:22.208 --> 43:24.079
- Dave!

43:24.123 --> 43:25.385
[Groaning]

43:25.428 --> 43:28.083
Um, I made plans with
my friend, Dave, tonight.

43:28.127 --> 43:29.345
He's the lawyer

43:29.389 --> 43:31.609
that's representing
the project I'm pitching,

43:31.652 --> 43:33.306
and we have so
much work to do.

43:33.349 --> 43:34.742
- Listen, I'm
leaving tomorrow

43:34.786 --> 43:36.744
and I really, really
wanna see you again,

43:36.788 --> 43:38.659
so why don't you just
bring him along?

43:38.703 --> 43:40.748
Come for an hour. Please?

43:40.792 --> 43:42.663
- All right! You're on!

43:42.707 --> 43:44.665
[Dog barking]

43:52.151 --> 43:54.544
- You're crazy, Joey!
It's freezing out here!

43:54.588 --> 43:55.763
- Man, this is the life!

43:55.807 --> 43:57.504
You, uh, you
staying for dinner?

43:57.547 --> 43:58.984
- I am!

43:59.027 --> 44:02.117
In fact, I picked up a feast
from Lindsay's favourite spot.

44:02.161 --> 44:03.292
- Oh, nice!

44:03.336 --> 44:05.817
- Yeah. Ah!

44:05.860 --> 44:08.689
This is the night, Joey.
Finally gonna do it.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.648
I'm gonna tell her
how I really feel.

44:10.691 --> 44:13.651
- That's awesome! I mean,
it's about time, but...

44:13.694 --> 44:14.782
[Chuckling]

44:14.826 --> 44:15.957
She's, uh...

44:16.001 --> 44:18.046
You think she's finally
ready to hear it?

44:18.090 --> 44:20.570
- I hope so.
I mean, we're best friends.

44:20.614 --> 44:23.486
We share everything.
We love spending time together.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.619
I just hope she feels
the same way.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.362
[Grunting]

44:31.407 --> 44:32.887
Ow!

44:34.193 --> 44:36.848
[Dog barking, panting]

44:36.891 --> 44:38.153
[Gasping]

44:38.197 --> 44:40.025
Hi! Come here.

44:40.068 --> 44:43.158
Come here.
What am I gonna name you?

44:43.202 --> 44:45.726
I need a name for you!
You're so cute.

44:45.770 --> 44:48.990
What if I name you Whiskers?

44:49.034 --> 44:52.080
No, what about Mr. Wish?

44:52.124 --> 44:54.169
Mr. Wishy! Muah!

44:54.213 --> 44:55.867
[Dog whining]

44:57.477 --> 44:59.174
[Lindsay scoffing]

44:59.218 --> 45:01.002
- [Dave]: I got
some great pasta,

45:01.046 --> 45:02.525
a little wine, some candles.

45:02.569 --> 45:03.744
What do you think?

45:03.788 --> 45:04.876
- Hey, Dave!

45:04.919 --> 45:05.877
- Oh hey!

45:05.920 --> 45:07.269
- Hey, Joey!

45:07.313 --> 45:09.054
Are you feeling better?

45:09.097 --> 45:10.533
- Still, uh, recovering,

45:10.577 --> 45:13.188
so I need to stay a couple
more nights, if that's cool.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.060
- Sure, but are those
your clothes

45:15.103 --> 45:17.192
lying on the floor
near the stairs?

45:17.236 --> 45:18.759
- Sorry, sweetie!
Those are mine.

45:18.803 --> 45:21.022
- Dad! Hi!
What are you doing here?

45:21.066 --> 45:22.850
Where's Mom?

45:22.894 --> 45:25.374
- Before I ran into her
at the timeshare,

45:25.418 --> 45:27.855
I was gonna move into
a new apartment.

45:27.899 --> 45:30.075
- Mm-hmm?

45:30.118 --> 45:33.121
- But then we decided that
I should move in with her.

45:33.165 --> 45:34.122
Big mistake.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.211
We had a little fight.

45:36.255 --> 45:38.300
Can I stay here
a couple of days?

45:38.344 --> 45:42.174
- What, is the whole family
just moving in now?

45:43.784 --> 45:46.047
Sure. Just pick up
after yourself, OK?

45:46.091 --> 45:47.962
- Promise! You won't
even know I'm here.

45:48.006 --> 45:51.052
- Dave, there's been a bunch of
change of plans for tonight.

45:51.096 --> 45:52.793
Can you come upstairs?
- Sure, sure.

45:52.837 --> 45:55.056
- OK, thanks.

45:55.100 --> 45:56.797
I've been invited
to this big gala

45:56.841 --> 45:58.668
by one of the investors
in GreenTree.

45:58.712 --> 46:00.148
I told him I was
busy tonight,

46:00.192 --> 46:02.150
but he said to just
come by for an hour

46:02.194 --> 46:03.325
and to bring you too.

46:03.369 --> 46:05.414
So, we can eat and
then do our work after.

46:05.458 --> 46:06.938
- Oh! You go.

46:06.981 --> 46:07.939
- Are you sure?

46:07.982 --> 46:09.679
You gotta meet him.
It'll be fun!

46:09.723 --> 46:11.029
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

46:11.072 --> 46:13.118
I got a lot of work to do
on the presentation.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.989
I'll take everything
over to my place.

46:15.033 --> 46:17.470
We'll eat there, go over
work when you get back.

46:23.215 --> 46:25.130
[Exhaling sharply]

46:29.177 --> 46:30.700
Wow!

46:30.744 --> 46:34.095
- I've had my eye on this dress,
these shoes and that purse

46:34.139 --> 46:35.270
for a long time,

46:35.314 --> 46:37.533
but they were always
just wishes till now.

46:37.577 --> 46:40.449
- I thought you didn't like
getting all dressed up.

46:40.493 --> 46:42.451
- Usually I don't,
but tonight, I thought:

46:42.495 --> 46:43.844
Why don't I just go for it?

46:43.888 --> 46:45.367
Can you help me
with the zipper?

46:45.411 --> 46:48.022
- Yeah, sure!
- Thanks!

46:54.072 --> 46:56.291
What, does this
make me look fat?

46:56.335 --> 46:58.641
- No! No, you
look beautiful.

46:58.685 --> 47:01.340
- It's the dress.
It's amazing!

47:01.383 --> 47:03.037
- It's not the dress.

47:07.433 --> 47:09.478
- Um, d-d-did you get it?

47:09.522 --> 47:10.697
- Yup!

47:10.740 --> 47:12.003
- [Laughing]: OK!

47:12.046 --> 47:13.656
I'm just gonna
go for an hour,

47:13.700 --> 47:15.833

[Chuckling]

01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:40.692
And yet, through it all,

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:42.737
you're just so
humble and honest.

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:48.047
- That's what
people call me:

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.527
Honest Lindsay!

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.661
I'm fine! I'm fine!

Just sometimes
I like to lead.

01:06:57.187 --> 01:06:58.275
- OK!

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.022
- OK, I'm done
leading now.

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.849
Actually, there's
part of my project

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.155
that I wanted
to show you,

01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:10.504
but it's in
the other room,

01:07:10.548 --> 01:07:12.158
so I'm just gonna
go and get it,

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:14.204
and you can just
stay here and sit.

How could you?

your problem is.

going on here?

Lindsay's three-timing us!

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.030
- No!

- I was so wrong
about you.

01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:06.517
You got a lot of
growing up to do.

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.003

01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:18.094

I was gonna introduce you.

This is Dave
Landry. He's...

- A friend,
just a good friend.

- Mm-hmm!

01:08:23.881 --> 01:08:27.799
- I finished the handouts.
I'll see you tomorrow?

01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:29.844
- Dave! Dave, wait--

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:33.152

I don't know what's
going on here,

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.865
and I think that
maybe tonight

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:53.041
was not the best night
for me to come over.

01:08:53.085 --> 01:08:54.478
- Oh, don't do that!

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.957
- You got a big
presentation tomorrow,

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:59.309
and I wanna thank you
for your dinner

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:00.962
I'll see you
in the office.

Yes!

your help last night.

to you about the pitch,

'cause I made
a few small changes.

was so crazy last night.

I'm sure that that
was the last of Billy,

working on the project,

brother will be moving out soon,

so I'm sorry.

- Well, you are
full of surprises.

01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:17.125

you what was going on.

them dead in there!

Thank you so much

for giving us the opportunity
to speak today.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:41.759
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:44.283
welcome to the future
of solar energy.

01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:47.068
[♪ Piano and percussion

01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:50.594
[Lindsay]: Simple solar cells
don't convert much electricity,

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:53.423
but with PMI's new design,
that's about to change.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.557
So, in conclusion,

01:10:57.601 --> 01:11:00.386
an efficient design
and cutting-edge technology

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.562
are clearly what
sets these solar panels

01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:04.085
apart from the pack.

01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:06.262
But a very wise person
once told me,

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:09.090
that to really go green,
you need the other green,

01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:10.309
which is profit.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.093
So by shortening
the testing period

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:15.314
and using dichromium panels
instead of the more costly ones,

01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:19.144
this project will have a
turnaround in not 3 to 5 years,

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:20.841
but in just under one.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:24.149
These panels will not only save
energy and help the environment,

01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:26.978
but they will quickly increase
GreenTree's bottom line,

01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:29.763
placing them at the forefront
of investment companies

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:30.764
for years to come.

01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:31.809

A change in the entire testings

a quick return.

It's the only way
to get it funded,

01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:56.502

trusted yourself more,

to find my true love.

a second, Lindsay.

really amazing,

and you're smart,
and you're talented,

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:26.919
and you're
so successful--

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:29.400
- Is this headed where
I think it's headed?

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:32.359
- But I can't go with you.
- Huh?

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:34.710
- I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:37.843
but you're everything
I ever wished for in a guy.

01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:39.192
- And?

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:41.891
- And I've been wishing
for the wrong guy.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:47.200
Thank you for
3 wonderful days,

01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:49.899

Reed, I have to go.

tell Woodhill

he has one less
executive at GreenTree?

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:56.557
- What? Why?

01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:57.950
- Profits are great,

01:18:57.994 --> 01:19:00.605
but not when they come before
doing the right thing.

01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:02.563
I made a really
big mistake back there,

01:19:02.607 --> 01:19:04.609
and I'll be damned
if I make another one.

Goodbye, Reed!
- Where are you going?

- To the guy
I never wished for!

- You know,
back in New York,

01:19:20.103 --> 01:19:22.061
this has become
my weekly ritual.

01:19:22.105 --> 01:19:23.149
- Yeah?

01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:25.412
- So, have you thought
about my offer?

01:19:25.456 --> 01:19:27.806
- I have, and I've
come to a decision.

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:30.766
- Tell you what, let's
climb first. You ready?

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:32.376
- I'll be there in a minute.

01:19:40.645 --> 01:19:42.299

- Lindsay?

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:48.087
- Yeah, your secretary
told me you were here.

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:50.611
- Is something wrong?
What happened?

01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:52.265
- No, no! Nothing like that.

01:19:52.309 --> 01:19:54.920
Um, tomorrow morning,
I'm quitting my job.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:57.618
I got blinded by
the wrong green,

01:19:57.662 --> 01:20:00.012
and the corporate world
wasn't for me.

01:20:00.056 --> 01:20:01.448
It never was.

01:20:01.492 --> 01:20:04.321
And I just said
good bye to Reed.

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:07.324
- What are you--
What are you saying?

01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:09.848
- That I'm an idiot!
I mean, you were right.

01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:11.937
I don't need wishes
to make me happy,

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:14.635
like getting a job promotion
or losing weight.

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.028
It doesn't
mean anything.

01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:17.813
And that big house?
That's not me!

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:20.728
But I finally realized that
I've had everything all along,

01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:22.208
and I just
didn't realize it.

01:20:22.252 --> 01:20:23.644
I didn't see it.

01:20:23.688 --> 01:20:26.473
And what's worse
is I didn't see you.

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:30.173
Dave, you're the one
that's always there for me,

01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:33.872
and you're the one that
I go to when I need help.

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:37.615
You're the one that
I can be me with, and...

01:20:39.704 --> 01:20:43.316
I'm so sorry it's taken
me so long to realize it,

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.101

my Mr. Right.

Dave, please don't
go to New York.

have this epiphany,

01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.376
I mean, just like that?

01:21:01.813 --> 01:21:05.817
I finally decided to
move on with my life.

expect me to say?
