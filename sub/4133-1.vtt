[All cheering]

00:26.200 --> 00:28.332
- That was beautiful.
Thank you, thank you!

00:28.376 --> 00:29.899
Thank you!
It's very beautiful.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.597
- Enough for the thank yous.
We can eat the cake now.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.252
- Not so fast!
She's gotta make her wish!

00:35.296 --> 00:36.688
Right, dear?
- Of course!

00:36.732 --> 00:38.081
- [Woman 1]:
Make a wish!

00:38.125 --> 00:39.561
- [Woman 2]:
Make it good!

00:39.604 --> 00:41.476
- [Man]: Let's go!
Come on!

00:42.781 --> 00:45.349
[All cheering]

00:45.393 --> 00:47.090
[Laughing]

00:47.134 --> 00:49.092
- Welcome to 25, Lindsay.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.876
- No, no, no!
Don't say it!

00:50.920 --> 00:52.878
It's too close
to the big 3-0.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.184
I wanna make a toast!

00:54.228 --> 00:56.404
To everybody who
helped put together

00:56.447 --> 00:57.622
this wonderful party!

00:57.666 --> 00:58.971
To my dear brother Joey.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.800
Enjoy that fat and
sugar while you can.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.628
- To Abby.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.239
I know we just
met at work,

01:05.282 --> 01:08.198
but I know we're gonna be
the dearest of friends.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.809
To my mom. Thank you for
not forgetting the date...

01:10.853 --> 01:11.984
[All laughing]

01:12.028 --> 01:14.291
...and for bringing
the recyclable forks,

01:14.335 --> 01:17.468
because you know how much
I care about the environment.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.122
And to my
oldest friend, Dave.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.211
- Whoa, whoa!
Not so fast!

01:21.255 --> 01:22.734
We are the same age.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.954
- Thank you for always
being there for me.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.216
Cheers!

01:26.260 --> 01:28.740
- [All]: Cheers!

01:28.784 --> 01:30.786
[Laughing]

01:30.829 --> 01:32.657
[All talking, indistinct]

01:32.701 --> 01:35.007
- [Woman]: Bye!

01:35.051 --> 01:37.749
- You, uh,
looking for Linds?

01:37.793 --> 01:38.750
- Yeah.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.317
- She went to her room.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.233
You finally gonna
tell her how you feel?

01:43.277 --> 01:46.018
What's taking so long?
- It's not that simple, Joey.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.239
If I tell her how I feel
and she's not interested,

01:49.283 --> 01:51.589
we could lose our
friendship forever.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.200
It means the
world to me.

01:55.071 --> 01:57.247
There you are!
- Hey!

01:57.291 --> 01:59.119
- People are starting to go.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.337
- Oh.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.425
- What's that?

02:01.469 --> 02:02.861
[Sighing]

02:02.905 --> 02:04.602
- OK, don't laugh!

02:04.646 --> 02:07.127
But it's my birthday wish list.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.301
Every year on my birthday,

02:08.345 --> 02:10.042
I make a wish
and I write it down.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.479
- I'm sorry.

02:11.522 --> 02:14.960
I've known you since 3rd grade,
but I didn't know that.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.137
- Well, it hasn't
helped, though.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.008
None have come true... yet.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.966
- Well, I have to see it.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.272
May I?

02:22.316 --> 02:23.534
[Inhaling deeply]

02:23.578 --> 02:25.145
- Fine!

02:25.188 --> 02:26.450
[Chuckling]

02:26.494 --> 02:28.800
- All right, let's
see what we have.

02:28.844 --> 02:29.801
"A puppy.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.847
"Fun In Play dollhouse.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.066
"My brother will
get chicken pox."

02:34.110 --> 02:35.807
- I was a vindictive kid.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.157
[Both chuckling]

02:37.200 --> 02:38.201
Oh! "Lose weight.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.335
"I'll be rescued by
Prince Charming.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.859
"Billy Maddox will fall
in love with me."

02:43.902 --> 02:45.469
- That was
from 8th grade.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.471
He was so cute!

02:47.515 --> 02:49.647
- "Perfect vision."

02:49.691 --> 02:50.996
[Sighing]

02:51.040 --> 02:53.173
"Mom and Dad will
get back together."

02:53.216 --> 02:54.739
- I'm not getting
my eyes lasered,

02:54.783 --> 02:57.438
and what kid doesn't wish
for their parents to remarry?

02:58.874 --> 03:00.832
What?

03:00.876 --> 03:04.227
- Nothing, just
your final wish.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.751
- That I'll find
my true love?

03:06.795 --> 03:09.928
I mean, a girl
can dream, can't she?

03:09.972 --> 03:11.582
- Sure!

03:11.626 --> 03:15.238
- So, none of these wishes have
come true. What does it matter?

03:15.282 --> 03:16.544
I mean, we're 25!

03:16.587 --> 03:18.241
The world is at
our fingertips!

03:18.285 --> 03:20.852
I mean, one day, I'm
gonna be a top executive

03:20.896 --> 03:22.419
at an environmental firm,

03:22.463 --> 03:26.336
and I'll be living in a big
house with the man that I love.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.252
From now on, all of my
wishes are gonna come true.

03:43.484 --> 03:46.226
- Miss Corwin?

03:46.269 --> 03:48.140
Miss Corwin?

03:50.099 --> 03:53.450
I need 20 copies by 11:00
and a refill by 10:00.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.365
[Sighing]

03:55.409 --> 03:58.542
- The day just started, and Kate
already has caffeine withdrawal?

03:58.586 --> 03:59.935
- Yeah.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.545
- New screensaver?
- Yeah.

04:01.589 --> 04:04.809
It's from last week. It was
our 6-month dating anniversary.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.898
Isn't he the best?

04:06.942 --> 04:09.292
Abby, I really feel
like he's the one.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.903
He's my Mr. Right.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.905
I'm so excited
about tonight.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.472
[Telephone ringing]

04:17.125 --> 04:18.954
Hello. GreenTree.
Can I help you?

04:18.997 --> 04:21.261
Oh, you have a great
product for us?

04:21.303 --> 04:23.480
An indoor bathroom
for dogs.

04:23.524 --> 04:27.397
Send us the information.
I'll pass it along to Ms. Moore.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.661
OK, have a nice day.

04:30.705 --> 04:34.012
I swear, one more green
dog idea, and I'm out of here.

04:34.056 --> 04:37.494
- You're gonna get an answer
on your project from Kate today?

04:37.538 --> 04:38.930
- What does it even matter?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.671
- Of course it will matter!

04:40.715 --> 04:42.456
I mean, you just found
a great product

04:42.499 --> 04:45.110
that's gonna save the planet
and get you a promotion.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.808
- We've been
assistants for 5 years.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.331
When has one of our own moved up

04:48.375 --> 04:50.768
to a life not chained
to these fake wooden desks?

04:50.812 --> 04:52.814
- These aren't real wood?

04:52.857 --> 04:54.294
How about
some cheering up?

04:54.337 --> 04:56.121
Let's get
together tonight.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.775
[â™ª Abby imitating bass beat ]

04:57.819 --> 04:59.603
- Tonight?
OK, all right!

04:59.647 --> 05:00.865
I'll play along.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.432
I'm going to my
mom's for dinner,

05:02.476 --> 05:04.347
and then I'm going to Kevin's.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.522
- Play along with what?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.350
- It's 3 days before
my 30th birthday,

05:07.394 --> 05:09.352
and no one's said anything
about a party.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.833
Kevin's acting super weird.
He's up to something.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.444
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.317
- I'll be embarrassed when
Kevin jumps out and yells...

05:21.364 --> 05:23.279
Kevin?

05:25.586 --> 05:27.196
[Woman giggling]

05:34.290 --> 05:36.771
[Gasping]

05:38.381 --> 05:40.252
- Lindsay!

05:40.296 --> 05:42.342
You're--you're early.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.430
[Gasping]

05:44.735 --> 05:46.346
This isn't what
it looks like.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.045
OK, it is what
it looks like.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.481
[Sighing]

05:51.525 --> 05:52.743
I'm sorry!

05:52.787 --> 05:55.180
What do you
want me to say?

05:55.224 --> 05:56.747
[Hands hitting thighs]

05:56.791 --> 05:58.749
- Surprise?

05:58.793 --> 06:01.926
But I guess that'll
have to be my line.

06:06.322 --> 06:09.238
[Dog barking]

06:10.457 --> 06:12.372
[Alarm beeping]

06:15.418 --> 06:17.377
[Groaning]

06:17.420 --> 06:19.379
[Alarm continues beeping]

06:19.422 --> 06:21.076
[Groaning]

06:32.566 --> 06:34.219
[Beeping]

06:34.263 --> 06:36.091
Ugh!

06:39.747 --> 06:41.444
[Scoffing]

06:41.488 --> 06:43.011
[Doorbell ringing]

06:45.100 --> 06:47.885
- Dave Landry,
legal eagle and chauffeur,

06:47.929 --> 06:49.365
at your service.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.760
We're taking my car, right?
Yours is still in the shop?

06:52.803 --> 06:54.414
- Yeah, when isn't it?

06:54.457 --> 06:56.416
- So, did you get an answer

06:56.459 --> 06:58.418
on our solar-panel
project yet?

06:58.461 --> 06:59.897
The company's asking.

06:59.941 --> 07:03.292
I told them, as their lawyer,
I can only do so much.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.728
- No, not yet. I'm just...

07:04.772 --> 07:07.296
They're waiting for
the right time, you know?

07:07.339 --> 07:10.778
- Oh. Is, uh,
everything all right?

07:10.821 --> 07:13.128
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.652
- You sure?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.743
- No, I'm not.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.963
Kevin and I broke up.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.139
- Oh, Lindsay!

07:24.182 --> 07:26.576
- He was cheating on me.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.925
- I'm sorry.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.492
You wanna talk about it?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.451
- I'm just--
I'm done with men!

07:31.494 --> 07:32.800
They're all dogs.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.455
Well, present
company excluded.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.847
- Well, thank you.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.110
You realize there are
different kinds of dogs--

07:39.154 --> 07:41.112
lap dogs, guard dogs,
working dogs.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.159
You, however, always seem
to end up with hound dogs.

07:44.202 --> 07:45.290
[Chuckling]

07:45.334 --> 07:47.292
- You always know
how to make me laugh.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.293
- Yeah?- Thank you.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.469
[Ringing]

07:49.512 --> 07:50.513
Sorry.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.734
Hey, Mom!
You at the airport?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.476
Yes, don't worry.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.522
I will survive my birthday
without you, I promise.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.830
Have fun in Mexico, OK?
Go easy on the cheese nachos.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.353
I love you.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.051
At least she still travels.

08:07.095 --> 08:10.228
Her and my dad rotate vacations
at the timeshare every year.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.231
- Still not talking?
- Are you kidding?
They're polar opposites.

08:13.275 --> 08:16.365
Talking about dogs, it's like
putting a little, fluffy poodle

08:16.408 --> 08:18.715
with a big
slobbering St. Bernard.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.501
[Telephone ringing]

08:21.544 --> 08:23.198
[Sighing]

08:28.029 --> 08:29.987
- Thanks for
the call last night.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.380
[Sighing]

08:31.423 --> 08:34.383
- I don't wanna say I told
you so, but I told you so!

08:34.426 --> 08:37.647
Why do you keep going out
with these hot-looking jerks?

08:37.691 --> 08:40.041
- I don't know. Is that
a trick question?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.826
- It's like you have
this list of ingredients

08:42.870 --> 08:44.087
for your perfect guy,

08:44.131 --> 08:45.089
and guess what?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.351
It's the wrong list.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.005
- Abby, this isn't helping!

08:48.049 --> 08:50.225
I need a cheerleader,
not Dr. Phil.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.532
- You need to start
dating men who cherish you,

08:52.575 --> 08:55.012
not talk a great game
but aren't worth your time.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.013
What about Dave?

08:56.057 --> 08:57.711
- Dave? My Dave?

08:57.754 --> 09:01.366
No, we've known each other
since we were little kids.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.672
He's like my brother.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.109
I mean, he's an amazing guy.
He's super sweet.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.198
I just don't feel it
with him, you know?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.897
- Or you won't let yourself
feel it with him

09:09.940 --> 09:11.159
because it's too scary.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.772
- Right there
on the left!

09:15.816 --> 09:17.208
- There's nowhere
to put it!

09:17.252 --> 09:18.383
- OK, all right.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.603
Now, use your leg
strength, not your arms.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.648
- I can't do it.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.693
- Yes, you can!
You're almost there!

09:23.737 --> 09:25.129
- Ah!- You got it.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.391
- Ah!- See?

09:26.435 --> 09:28.306
So? Great birthday
present, huh?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.787
I've been wanting to
get you out here forever.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.746
You love the outdoors,
you're sporty,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.922
and you never shy
away from a challenge.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.315
- Yeah, not one that
involves a parachute!

09:37.359 --> 09:39.056
- Looking good
for your first time!

09:39.100 --> 09:42.233
Dave started me climbing
a few months ago. I'm hooked!

09:42.277 --> 09:44.061
It's a great way
to tone your legs.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.236
Right, sweetheart?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.195
- Right!

09:48.500 --> 09:50.807
- Hey! Dave!
Dave Landry!

09:50.851 --> 09:52.069
- Cliff!

09:52.113 --> 09:53.636
Man, long time!

09:53.680 --> 09:55.725
- I'm in town from
New York for the week.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.292
Taking a break
between meetings.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.946
- Dave, I can't move.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.904
- I was thinking
about you recently.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.253
- Yeah?
- We need to talk.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.907
Call my office
to set something up.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.648
- Sure thing!
- All right.

10:05.692 --> 10:06.736
- [Lindsay]: Dave!

10:06.780 --> 10:07.737
- Oh!

10:07.781 --> 10:08.956
I'm so sorry.
Are you OK?

10:08.999 --> 10:10.784
- I think I'm ready
to get down now.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.089
- Here's the fun part.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.309
You just push off.
Trish will ease you down.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.441
- I'm supposed to just let go?
- Yeah!

10:16.485 --> 10:18.618
- Are you crazy?
I'm not gonna let go!

10:18.661 --> 10:20.750
- There's nothing
to be scared of.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.273
It's all about trust.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.624
- Oh, I trust people.
That's not the problem.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.191
- Not people.
You, Lindsay.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.106
Trust yourself.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.499
OK?

10:30.542 --> 10:31.761
Oh, come on!

10:31.805 --> 10:33.023
- Not today.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.678
- Not today.
OK, I'll help you out.

10:35.722 --> 10:36.679
- Please.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.680
- OK, here we go.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.986
- OK.- All right?

10:39.029 --> 10:40.117
- Aaah!
- Whoa!

10:40.161 --> 10:41.641
[Both groaning]

10:43.338 --> 10:44.556
[Chuckling]

10:44.600 --> 10:46.297
- Um...

10:46.341 --> 10:47.864
- [Both]:
Are you OK?

10:47.908 --> 10:49.692
- I'm fine. You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.781
Just point me in
any direction

10:51.825 --> 10:53.957
away from
Mt. Everest over here.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.567
[Laughing, sighing]

10:55.611 --> 10:56.786
OK!

10:56.830 --> 10:57.787
- That was fun.

10:57.831 --> 10:58.788
- Yeah!

10:58.832 --> 11:00.660
- Thanks for
bringing me again.

11:00.703 --> 11:01.791
- Sure!

11:01.835 --> 11:03.793
- Remember what we
were talking about?

11:03.837 --> 11:05.490
It's been several
months now.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.971
I'm ready to take this
to the next level.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.886
- You sure you can
handle a harder climb?

11:09.930 --> 11:12.715
- I'm not talking
about rock climbing!

11:12.759 --> 11:14.848
- Oh!

11:16.371 --> 11:18.982
Look, I--I know
we talked about this.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.854
It's just...

11:23.770 --> 11:25.989
I thought my feelings
would change.

11:26.033 --> 11:29.601
I'm not ready. Sorry.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.690
[Sighing]

11:30.733 --> 11:32.430
- Well, Dave,
you're a great guy.

11:32.474 --> 11:36.521
If and when you're
ever ready, call me.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.088
- OK.

11:38.132 --> 11:41.004
So, rock climbing wasn't
the best birthday present.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.266
- Well, I knew not to get

11:42.310 --> 11:44.355
the "climb every
mountain" discount pack.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.530
- Right.- Yeah.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.750
[Both sighing]

11:47.794 --> 11:51.406
Dave, I'm almost 30.
I'm almost 30!

11:51.449 --> 11:52.407
- Relax.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.756
You at least got 20 years

11:53.800 --> 11:55.410
before you start going grey,

11:55.453 --> 11:57.760
although I think I see
something on the left.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.849
- Do you remember
my birthday wish list?

11:59.893 --> 12:00.850
- Sure!

12:00.894 --> 12:02.417
- None of them
have come true!

12:02.460 --> 12:06.290
- Linds, you don't realize
how lucky you are.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.728
You're beautiful,
you're smart.

12:08.771 --> 12:12.122
Trust me, any guy would
kill to be with you,

12:12.166 --> 12:13.733
except Kevin,
but he's a jerk.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.778
- And don't
forget about Brad.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.040
- Oh, Brad!

12:17.084 --> 12:18.259
[Both chuckling]

12:18.302 --> 12:20.304
Look, if you run
out of options,

12:20.348 --> 12:21.479
there's always me!

12:21.523 --> 12:24.221
- Dave, you'll
always be best friend.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.315
Um, so, what happened
to Trish tonight?

12:31.359 --> 12:32.795
Where was she?

12:32.839 --> 12:35.798
- Oh, um, I didn't
wanna dampen the mood,

12:35.842 --> 12:37.408
but we broke up.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.236
- You guys
seemed so happy!

12:39.280 --> 12:40.585
- I know.

12:40.629 --> 12:41.891
And she's great,

12:41.935 --> 12:44.502
just not the
right one for me.

12:46.026 --> 12:48.158
- I am looking forward
to a night in,

12:48.202 --> 12:50.073
a good book and
a bowl of ice cream.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.989
- Mmm! Well, I could come
over later if you want.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.513
We could do one of
our binge TV marathons?

12:55.557 --> 12:57.124
Drama? Suspense?

12:57.167 --> 12:58.603
- [Both]: Comedy.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.997
[Both chuckling]

13:01.041 --> 13:02.303
- You know, actually,

13:02.346 --> 13:05.175
there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.698
- What?

13:06.742 --> 13:09.527
- It's about our, uh...

13:12.574 --> 13:14.924
Maybe we should talk
about this over dinner.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.796
- OK, sure.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.363
- Uh, wait!

- [Abby]: Gotcha!

13:24.891 --> 13:25.848
- Surprise!

13:25.892 --> 13:27.545
- Never trust
a lawyer.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.810
- [All]:
â™ª ...that nobody can deny

13:30.853 --> 13:32.986
- You know, one candle
would've been enough.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.945
OK!

13:35.989 --> 13:37.164
- Wait!

13:37.207 --> 13:39.122
What happened
to making a wish?

13:39.166 --> 13:41.298
- If none of them
have come true by now,

13:41.342 --> 13:43.126
I kind of figure
what's the point?

13:43.170 --> 13:45.694
- The point is it never hurts!
Wish for a promotion.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.304
- I wished for that
3 years ago.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.566
- What about
a new car?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.133
- I wished for
that 2 years ago.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.875
If I'd gotten the promotion,
I could've afforded the car.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.660
- Wish to win the lottery
or for something not for you.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.838
- Every year I enter the charity
sweepstakes, and I never win.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.883
I already wished
for the city to go solar

14:00.927 --> 14:02.319
and for Kern Park
to be saved,

14:02.363 --> 14:03.755
so I'm not holding my breath.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.714
- How about finding
your perfect guy?

14:05.757 --> 14:08.325
- Last year, I wished
I would find my Mr. Right

14:08.369 --> 14:09.500
before I turned 30,

14:09.544 --> 14:11.372
and I found my
Mr. Definitely Wrong.

I'm the next Julia Child.

29:06.614 --> 29:07.789
- [Both]: Hmm!

29:07.833 --> 29:09.573
- And feast your eyes

29:09.617 --> 29:13.403
On your new luxury,
top-of-the-line SUV.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.144
- Oh, I can't drive that!

29:15.188 --> 29:18.408
I work for one of the top
environmental firms in the city.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.933
That's a gas-guzzling
monster car.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.805
It probably gets
10 miles a gallon downhill.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.895
- Well, you can't
return the prizes,

29:26.939 --> 29:29.680
but there's no reason
why you can't sell it.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.291
[Sighing]

29:35.861 --> 29:37.645
[Answering machine beeping]

29:37.688 --> 29:39.647
- Hey, Joey! Pick up!

29:39.690 --> 29:42.824
Do you wanna come sleep
in my new mansion tonight?

29:42.868 --> 29:46.349
It's 475 Lakeview Terrace.
The keys are under the mat.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.525
Oh, bring the puppy!
OK. OK, bye.

29:48.569 --> 29:49.788
[Lindsay sighing]

29:53.966 --> 29:55.184
- Lindsay Corwin.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.272
- Billy!

29:56.316 --> 29:59.275
- Wow! Look at you!

29:59.319 --> 30:00.973
Oh, sit, sit!

30:01.016 --> 30:02.670
- Oh, thanks!

30:04.367 --> 30:06.848
Wow! You look great!

30:06.892 --> 30:08.154
- Oh, come on!

30:08.197 --> 30:11.461
But you! You haven't
changed a bit!

30:11.505 --> 30:13.942
I mean, you were
pretty then, but now...

30:13.986 --> 30:15.161
[Chuckling]

30:15.204 --> 30:17.685
- I never thought
that you even noticed me.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.382
- Are you kidding?

30:19.426 --> 30:21.950
I couldn't keep my
eyes off of you.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.170
You know, I really
couldn't believe my luck

30:24.213 --> 30:26.476
when I found you
on the Internet.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.870
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.698
- Wow! You're
not kidding!

30:30.741 --> 30:32.961
So, you're a doctor.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.963
- Podiatrist.- Oh!

30:35.007 --> 30:37.052
- If you got a problem
with your feet,

30:37.096 --> 30:38.662
I'm happy to take a look.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.229
- No, they're good!
They're fine!

30:40.273 --> 30:41.578
- OK!
- They're great, yeah.

30:41.622 --> 30:44.190
- I haven't married.
- Oh!

30:44.233 --> 30:48.063
- Still hanging out with
the guys from McKinley.
- Ah!

30:48.107 --> 30:50.674
- You remember Perkins?
Big glasses, squeaky voice?

30:50.718 --> 30:51.893
- Yeah!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.242
- And Feldberg always told

30:53.286 --> 30:54.504
those knock-knock jokes.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.158
- They've changed
a lot, huh?

30:56.202 --> 30:57.594
- No, why?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.075
- Oh, I...

31:00.119 --> 31:01.207
- What about you?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.687
Single? Married?

31:03.731 --> 31:05.864
- I'm single.
I work at GreenTree.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.692
It's an environmental
development company.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.391
Actually, I just got
promoted to director.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.742
- Fantastic!
Congratulations!

31:14.785 --> 31:15.874
- Thank you.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.920
So, this is so funny!

31:18.964 --> 31:20.182
[Chuckling]

31:20.226 --> 31:21.401
This is so funny!

31:21.444 --> 31:25.753
- Lindsay, I--I gotta
be honest.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.712
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.758
- Yeah, you said that.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.543
- And I know we didn't
talk a lot back then,

31:33.587 --> 31:36.633
but I always felt that
there was something there.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.634
I--I felt it.

31:37.678 --> 31:38.679
- That's funny,

31:38.722 --> 31:41.029
'cause I don't
really remember ever--

31:41.073 --> 31:43.771
- The truth is
I know it's been years,

31:43.814 --> 31:47.949
but the second that you came
through that door and I saw you,

31:47.993 --> 31:51.431
I felt like I was in
the 8th grade all over again.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.478
I mean, the feeling
is still there.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.784
- You know, Billy,

31:56.827 --> 31:59.482
you know how sometimes
people can sort of create

31:59.526 --> 32:01.397
a fantasy about
another person.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.703
- Oh yeah!

32:04.096 --> 32:06.228
- You don't really know me,

32:06.272 --> 32:09.101
so how can you have
feelings for me?

32:10.450 --> 32:12.321
[Sighing]

32:12.365 --> 32:14.933
- Yeah, I thought
this might happen.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.805
I shouldn't have
said anything.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.502
I am such an idiot!

32:19.546 --> 32:21.417
You probably hate me.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.506
- No! No, I don't
hate you, Billy. No!

32:23.550 --> 32:24.681
- You don't?

32:24.725 --> 32:25.856
- No!

32:25.900 --> 32:28.511
- So, you feel it too.

32:28.555 --> 32:30.992
Lindsay, this could
really be amazing!

32:31.036 --> 32:34.604
I think we should get
together again. Tonight!

32:34.648 --> 32:37.129
- Oh, you know what?
Oh, it's late!

32:37.172 --> 32:39.174
It's so late.
Uh, I gotta go!

32:39.218 --> 32:40.436
I'm so sorry.
I gotta go!

32:40.480 --> 32:41.785
- We haven't even ordered.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.004
- I know.
I'm so sorry!

32:43.048 --> 32:45.137
I have an early meeting,
and I'm late.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.704
But it was really good
to see you again, Billy.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.619
[Sighing]

32:49.663 --> 32:51.491
Bye.

32:54.537 --> 32:58.106
- [Dave]: So, how's the
high-school reunion going?

32:58.150 --> 33:01.153
- I mean, he was so cool
in 8th grade.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.372
The problem is he's still
in the 8th grade.

33:03.416 --> 33:07.289
I couldn't meet Mr. Right if
he hit me with a 10-foot pole.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.726
- I'll be there
in 15 minutes.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.380
- Oh no!
Oh no, that's Woodhill.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.295
He's coming towards
the parking lot.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.123
If he sees me in the car,
I am dead!

33:15.167 --> 33:16.603
I gotta go!
I gotta go! Bye!

33:20.781 --> 33:23.610
[Cars honking]

33:25.568 --> 33:26.526
[Scoffing]

33:26.569 --> 33:27.831
- Hey!

33:27.875 --> 33:29.572
- This is my spot.
Did you not see me?

33:29.616 --> 33:31.922
- You're pretty hard
to miss in that tank!

33:31.966 --> 33:33.402
OK, go ahead.
Steal my spot.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.491
You people think
you own the world.

33:35.535 --> 33:39.017
- Us people? You think
that you know me because
of the car that I drive?

33:39.060 --> 33:40.496
- Uh, yeah!
Yeah, I think I do.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.933
I think material
objects make you happy,

33:42.977 --> 33:45.153
status is more important
than anything to you

33:45.197 --> 33:47.547
and you don't give a hoot
about the environment.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.070
- Wow!

33:49.114 --> 33:52.247
That actually could not be
more of a dead-wrong statement.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.032
Let me try you.
- OK.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.859
- You only shop
at designer stores,

33:55.903 --> 33:57.557
you way overpay
for your haircuts

33:57.600 --> 33:59.515
and you drive a hybrid
so people think

33:59.559 --> 34:01.256
you're into
the environment,

34:01.300 --> 34:02.779
but clearly you
aren't at all.

34:02.823 --> 34:03.867
- Wow!- Yeah!

34:03.911 --> 34:05.260
- That's 2 out
of 3. Not bad.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.175
- Mm-hmm!
- Oh, hey!

34:07.219 --> 34:08.655
Give me a call

34:08.697 --> 34:11.223
next time you find a spot
you can't actually fit into.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.266
- I can fit.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.748
- Oh, OK! Good luck!

34:18.926 --> 34:20.101
[Scoffing]

34:25.585 --> 34:26.934
[Tires screeching]

34:29.110 --> 34:30.981
[Car honking, tires screeching]

34:31.025 --> 34:32.505
- Ugh!

34:36.248 --> 34:38.902
- [Claudia]: Good morning.
- [Lindsay]: Good morning!

34:38.946 --> 34:40.600
- Here's today's paper.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.036
- Oh, thank you!

34:44.864 --> 34:47.737
[Gasping]

34:47.781 --> 34:50.436
This is fantastic!

34:50.478 --> 34:53.786
- And this is all the
photovoltaic information

34:53.830 --> 34:55.092
you've requested.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.572
- So what's all this, then?

34:56.616 --> 34:59.140
- Oh, half of it is
getting you caught up

34:59.184 --> 35:00.837
with our current products.

35:00.881 --> 35:03.927
The rest is the usual stuff.
Budget, reports, analysis.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.494
- Do I have to
read it all?

35:05.538 --> 35:07.409
- By 11:00 a.m.
Staff meeting.

35:07.453 --> 35:08.628
Welcome to management.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.412
[Giggling, groaning]

35:10.456 --> 35:13.415
- And on page 5
of the spreadsheet,

35:13.459 --> 35:15.678
you'll find
profit projections.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.248
OK, moving to new projects.

35:20.292 --> 35:23.295
- Every division has posted
a year-over-year gain.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.861
We project more to come.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.124
- As per the memo,

35:26.167 --> 35:28.343
Mr. Woodhill will be
touring the office today

35:28.387 --> 35:31.172
with some Wall Street men
and a big investor.

35:31.216 --> 35:34.132
If we go public,
we have to deliver big time.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.525
Kate, you're making
the product recommendation

35:36.569 --> 35:38.440
to Mr. Woodhill on Friday.

35:38.484 --> 35:39.659
OK, good. So...

35:40.834 --> 35:42.488
[Renshaw chuckling]

35:42.531 --> 35:44.620
Uh, you don't need
to raise your hand.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.187
- Oh. Um, I just
wanted to say

35:46.231 --> 35:48.058
that I have
an incredible project

35:48.102 --> 35:50.060
that I would like
to present as well.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.150
It's a breakthrough
solar technology

35:52.193 --> 35:53.716
that will slash
energy costs.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.632
- I'm sorry, but it's too late
to add another presentation.

35:56.676 --> 35:59.287
The schedule's already set.
You can pitch in 6 months.

35:59.331 --> 36:00.984
So, moving on
to financial reports.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.638
- [Woodhill]:
Excuse me, Frank!

36:02.682 --> 36:05.163
Sorry to intrude.
My apologies, everyone.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.165
I'll just be
a couple of minutes.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.993
I want you all to meet
one of our newest investors

36:10.037 --> 36:11.647
who's visiting us
from Boston.

36:11.691 --> 36:14.302
Everyone, meet Reed Paulson.

36:14.346 --> 36:15.999
- Hi, everyone!

36:16.043 --> 36:17.218
- Hello.- Hi.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.654
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.830
I told Barry I'm not
just a silent investor,

36:20.874 --> 36:23.311
I'm also trying to be an
invisible one, so carry on.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.095
Keep up the good work.
Carry on.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.706
- Nonsense, nonsense!

36:26.749 --> 36:29.578
I want you to meet the people
who keep GreenTree number one.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.406
This is Gerry McClintock
in accounting.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.017
Lee Parsons, research.
- Hi!

36:34.061 --> 36:35.932
- Kate Moore,
Director of New Projects.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.238
- Hi, Kate.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.675
- Across from her
is our newest director,

36:39.719 --> 36:41.721
at least I think it is.

36:41.764 --> 36:44.332
Yes, that's Lindsay Corwin.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.247
- I actually think
that we have met.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.771
Weren't you the one
who was driving that big--

36:48.815 --> 36:51.383
- Horrible loaner car.
It was awful. It was a loaner.

36:51.426 --> 36:54.255
- Well, there'll be plenty of
time later to meet the others.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.562
Frank, I'll let you get
back to your meeting.

36:56.605 --> 36:58.955
- Mr. Woodhill,
one moment!

36:58.999 --> 37:01.697
Um, I know that your
schedule's already set

37:01.741 --> 37:03.351
for Friday's presentations,

37:03.395 --> 37:06.746
but I have something incredible
that you have to see.

37:06.789 --> 37:10.140
- Well, that's wonderful!
I like someone with passion.

37:10.184 --> 37:13.535
But I have no time, so come
to me on the next round.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.929
- With all due respect,
this can't wait.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.714
This company and
our environment can't wait.

37:18.758 --> 37:22.370
Um, GreenTree needs bold,
forward-thinking ventures

37:22.414 --> 37:24.807
in keeping with your
forward-thinking agenda

37:24.851 --> 37:28.158
to support products that will
sustain our environment

37:28.202 --> 37:29.551
for centuries to come.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.466
And I can show you
that on Friday.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.641
You won't regret it.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.426
- Well, I don't take well

37:34.469 --> 37:38.125
to people trying to force
something down my throat...

37:38.168 --> 37:39.387
[Clearing throat]

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
...unless it's for
a good cause.

37:42.869 --> 37:46.786
Frank, make some time
on Friday, will you?

37:46.829 --> 37:50.311
- So, Corwin, I want a preview
of that presentation

37:50.355 --> 37:51.921
in my office tomorrow morning.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.314
- No problem, yeah.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.056
- OK, meeting adjourned!

37:59.146 --> 38:01.191
- [Woman]:
It's unbelievable!

38:01.235 --> 38:02.323
[Cell phone dialling]

38:02.367 --> 38:03.455
- Lindsay?

38:03.498 --> 38:05.413
- Dave, I did it.
We got the pitch.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.023
It's in 2 days.
Can you make it?

38:07.067 --> 38:08.938
- Can I make it?
This is great news!

38:08.982 --> 38:10.375
Of course I can make it.

38:10.418 --> 38:12.290
- Can you meet me?
I'm gonna go for lunch.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.682
We have so much prep to do.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.815
- Shoot! I can't.
I've got an appointment.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.600
- What if you come over
to the new house after work?

38:18.644 --> 38:20.428
- Perfect.
Let's make this our dinner.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.300
We can work and
then talk afterwards.

38:22.343 --> 38:25.041
I'll bring something amazing.
Don't you lift a finger.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.129
- You are the best!

38:26.173 --> 38:27.261
Dave, I really think

38:27.305 --> 38:29.132
that this could
change things for us.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.699
- I think you're right.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.353
- Bye!

38:40.013 --> 38:41.536
[Sighing]

38:41.580 --> 38:43.321
- Excuse me.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.932
[Sighing]

38:47.368 --> 38:49.631
[Sighing]

38:49.675 --> 38:52.721
- Well, look who it is! The
tank-driving environmentalist.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.201
Hi!

38:54.244 --> 38:56.159
- Hi! Like I said,
it's not my car!

38:56.203 --> 38:57.639
- No, but it looked like

38:57.683 --> 39:00.555
you were having a
good time driving it.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.644
- No, it is a
genuine gas-guzzling,

39:02.688 --> 39:04.037
carbon-spewing
monster car.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.387
I won it in a contest,
and I'm gonna sell it.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.651
- And you were just giving it
a little test drive.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.827
- I care deeply
about the environment.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.090
It was really nice
to see you again.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.223
- Well, that makes
two of us.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.097
Do you wanna talk
some more about this?

39:21.141 --> 39:24.405
Maybe over lunch? I think
my table just opened up.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.018
[Lindsay chuckling]

39:29.062 --> 39:32.021
- It just started with one
shop in the heart of Boston,

39:32.065 --> 39:34.023
and it just spread
like wildfire.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.677
We must've been
among the first

39:35.721 --> 39:38.419
environmentally conscious
dry-cleaning businesses.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.855
And so, before I knew it,

39:39.899 --> 39:42.423
all of a sudden, it's
a $70 million business.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.425
- Wow!

39:44.469 --> 39:46.906
- And, of course,
it gave us a little freedom

39:46.949 --> 39:48.734
to do other things
like GreenTree.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.605
And well, I'm here
for the opening

39:50.649 --> 39:53.391
of the new headquarters
of a charity that I support.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.088
- So, you were
born in Boston?

39:55.131 --> 39:56.394
- Oh yeah!

39:56.437 --> 39:59.092
I just love the town,
you know, how it's modern,

39:59.135 --> 40:01.573
but yet it's also kept
its history, you know?

40:01.616 --> 40:03.052
How about you?

40:03.096 --> 40:05.098
- Uh, yeah, I was
born right here

40:05.141 --> 40:07.622
in a city that's losing
all of its history

40:07.666 --> 40:10.059
because we tear down the
beautiful buildings

40:10.103 --> 40:11.104
and put up new ones.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.888
- Some people
call that progress.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.455
- Yeah, and progress is great

40:14.499 --> 40:17.719
but as long as you don't destroy
all the beauty and the charm

40:17.763 --> 40:18.720
in the process.

40:18.764 --> 40:21.157
- Please tell me
you're not married

40:21.201 --> 40:24.073
or that you have an incurable
disease or 24-hour memory loss

40:24.117 --> 40:25.161
or something like that.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.424
- What's your name again?

40:26.467 --> 40:28.121
[Both chuckling]

40:28.164 --> 40:29.731
- OK.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.951
Listen, you know that
charity that I mentioned?

40:31.994 --> 40:34.344
Well, they have their
opening night gala tonight.

40:34.388 --> 40:35.781
I don't wanna
be presumptuous,

40:35.824 --> 40:38.000
but I would love it
if you would be my date.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.437
[Chuckling]

40:39.480 --> 40:42.004
- Lindsay?
This is a surprise!

40:42.048 --> 40:44.659
I was just passing by
and saw you here.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.096
Do you mind if
I have a seat?

40:47.140 --> 40:49.838
- Uh, kind of.

40:49.882 --> 40:51.753
[Sighing]

40:51.797 --> 40:52.754
- Hi.

40:52.798 --> 40:53.973
- Billy Maddox.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.497
- Hi! Reed Paulson.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.544
- So, how do you two
know each other?

41:00.849 --> 41:02.764
- Business associates.

41:02.808 --> 41:04.505
- Well, it's nice
to meet you.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.464
Linds and I
go way back.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.466
- Billy and I are
old school friends.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.772
We haven't seen
each other in a long time.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.166
- And suddenly,
we got back together,

41:13.209 --> 41:14.950
and boom!

41:14.994 --> 41:16.648
Like no time had past.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.519
That spark was still
there, right, hon?

41:18.563 --> 41:20.303
- Billy, what are
you talking about?

41:20.347 --> 41:22.523
- Are you two...
- Involved?

41:22.567 --> 41:23.785
[Scoffing]

41:23.829 --> 41:27.136
Ah, all I can say
is that we hit it off

41:27.180 --> 41:29.878
the second we saw
each other again.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.490
I mean, it was a
surprise for both of us.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.143
- Billy, we are not involved!

41:34.187 --> 41:35.493
- Yet!

41:35.536 --> 41:36.711
[Chuckling]

41:36.755 --> 41:38.800
We, uh, I mean,
we can't rush this.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.629
We gotta let it grow
at its own pace.

41:41.673 --> 41:45.241
- OK, I think I've gotten
in-between something here.

41:45.285 --> 41:47.330
I'm gonna go, all right?

41:47.374 --> 41:49.332
This should be enough
to cover the lunch.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.030
Billy, it was great
to have met you,

41:51.073 --> 41:53.511
and Lindsay, thank you
for a wonderful lunch.

41:53.554 --> 41:55.643
- This is not
what it looks like.

41:55.687 --> 41:58.341
- It's exactly what it
looks like. Nice to meet you.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.213
- OK.

42:03.129 --> 42:05.740
- Billy, I don't know
what your problem is,

42:05.784 --> 42:08.351
but there is nothing
going on between us.

42:08.395 --> 42:11.093
Do I make myself clear?
Do you understand that?

42:11.137 --> 42:12.442
- When you calm down...

42:12.486 --> 42:13.661
- Ugh!

42:13.705 --> 42:15.663
- ...I think that
you are going to have

42:15.707 --> 42:17.056
second thoughts
about that.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.804
[Sighing]

42:27.719 --> 42:29.547
- Reed!

42:29.590 --> 42:32.724
Reed, wait!
I am--

42:32.767 --> 42:34.552
- No, no, just wait!
Let me guess.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.597
You won him too?
Charity? Auction?

42:36.641 --> 42:38.120
- No! Let me explain.

42:38.164 --> 42:40.775
I have not seen that guy since
middle school. He's insane.

42:40.819 --> 42:43.082
There's absolutely
nothing going on between us.

42:43.125 --> 42:45.258
I think he followed
me into the restaurant.

42:45.301 --> 42:47.216
- Yeah?- Yes!

42:47.260 --> 42:50.219
Oh! Come here,
come here, come here!

42:50.263 --> 42:51.569
Ah!

42:51.612 --> 42:53.483
- Do you have
yourself a stalker?

42:53.527 --> 42:54.702
Are you
gonna be OK?

42:54.746 --> 42:56.095
- I think he's harmless.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.705
- OK, well, that's good.

42:57.749 --> 43:00.578
Listen, I just don't wanna get
in the middle of something,

43:00.621 --> 43:02.754
like with you and your
boyfriend or anything.

43:02.797 --> 43:05.583
- No! No, Billy is the last
person I would date, ever.

43:05.626 --> 43:08.586
And the answer to
your question is yes.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.804
Yeah!

43:09.848 --> 43:11.414
- Yes?

43:11.458 --> 43:12.981
- About tonight.
I would love to.

43:13.025 --> 43:14.069
- Really?

43:14.113 --> 43:15.157
- Mm-hmm!

43:15.201 --> 43:16.419
- Oh, that is perfect!

43:16.463 --> 43:18.639
Listen, I'm gonna
send a car around 7:00.

43:18.683 --> 43:20.902
I'll have my assistant
call your office.

43:20.946 --> 43:22.164
- Great!- Good!

43:22.208 --> 43:24.079
- Dave!

43:24.123 --> 43:25.385
[Groaning]

43:25.428 --> 43:28.083
Um, I made plans with
my friend, Dave, tonight.

43:28.127 --> 43:29.345
He's the lawyer

43:29.389 --> 43:31.609
that's representing
the project I'm pitching,

43:31.652 --> 43:33.306
and we have so
much work to do.

43:33.349 --> 43:34.742
- Listen, I'm
leaving tomorrow

43:34.786 --> 43:36.744
and I really, really
wanna see you again,

43:36.788 --> 43:38.659
so why don't you just
bring him along?

43:38.703 --> 43:40.748
Come for an hour. Please?

43:40.792 --> 43:42.663
- All right! You're on!

43:42.707 --> 43:44.665
[Dog barking]

43:52.151 --> 43:54.544
- You're crazy, Joey!
It's freezing out here!

43:54.588 --> 43:55.763
- Man, this is the life!

43:55.807 --> 43:57.504
You, uh, you
staying for dinner?

43:57.547 --> 43:58.984
- I am!

43:59.027 --> 44:02.117
In fact, I picked up a feast
from Lindsay's favourite spot.

44:02.161 --> 44:03.292
- Oh, nice!

44:03.336 --> 44:05.817
- Yeah. Ah!

44:05.860 --> 44:08.689
This is the night, Joey.
Finally gonna do it.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.648
I'm gonna tell her
how I really feel.

44:10.691 --> 44:13.651
- That's awesome! I mean,
it's about time, but...

44:13.694 --> 44:14.782
[Chuckling]

44:14.826 --> 44:15.957
She's, uh...

44:16.001 --> 44:18.046
You think she's finally
ready to hear it?

44:18.090 --> 44:20.570
- I hope so.
I mean, we're best friends.

44:20.614 --> 44:23.486
We share everything.
We love spending time together.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.619
I just hope she feels
the same way.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.362
[Grunting]

44:31.407 --> 44:32.887
Ow!

44:34.193 --> 44:36.848
[Dog barking, panting]

44:36.891 --> 44:38.153
[Gasping]

44:38.197 --> 44:40.025
Hi! Come here.

44:40.068 --> 44:43.158
Come here.
What am I gonna name you?

44:43.202 --> 44:45.726
I need a name for you!
You're so cute.

44:45.770 --> 44:48.990
What if I name you Whiskers?

44:49.034 --> 44:52.080
No, what about Mr. Wish?

44:52.124 --> 44:54.169
Mr. Wishy! Muah!

44:54.213 --> 44:55.867
[Dog whining]

44:57.477 --> 44:59.174
[Lindsay scoffing]

44:59.218 --> 45:01.002
- [Dave]: I got
some great pasta,

45:01.046 --> 45:02.525
a little wine, some candles.

45:02.569 --> 45:03.744
What do you think?

45:03.788 --> 45:04.876
- Hey, Dave!

45:04.919 --> 45:05.877
- Oh hey!

45:05.920 --> 45:07.269
- Hey, Joey!

45:07.313 --> 45:09.054
Are you feeling better?

45:09.097 --> 45:10.533
- Still, uh, recovering,

45:10.577 --> 45:13.188
so I need to stay a couple
more nights, if that's cool.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.060
- Sure, but are those
your clothes

45:15.103 --> 45:17.192
lying on the floor
near the stairs?

45:17.236 --> 45:18.759
- Sorry, sweetie!
Those are mine.

45:18.803 --> 45:21.022
- Dad! Hi!
What are you doing here?

45:21.066 --> 45:22.850
Where's Mom?

45:22.894 --> 45:25.374
- Before I ran into her
at the timeshare,

45:25.418 --> 45:27.855
I was gonna move into
a new apartment.

45:27.899 --> 45:30.075
- Mm-hmm?

45:30.118 --> 45:33.121
- But then we decided that
I should move in with her.

45:33.165 --> 45:34.122
Big mistake.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.211
We had a little fight.

45:36.255 --> 45:38.300
Can I stay here
a couple of days?

45:38.344 --> 45:42.174
- What, is the whole family
just moving in now?

45:43.784 --> 45:46.047
Sure. Just pick up
after yourself, OK?

45:46.091 --> 45:47.962
- Promise! You won't
even know I'm here.

45:48.006 --> 45:51.052
- Dave, there's been a bunch of
change of plans for tonight.

45:51.096 --> 45:52.793
Can you come upstairs?
- Sure, sure.

45:52.837 --> 45:55.056
- OK, thanks.

45:55.100 --> 45:56.797
I've been invited
to this big gala

45:56.841 --> 45:58.668
by one of the investors
in GreenTree.

45:58.712 --> 46:00.148
I told him I was
busy tonight,

46:00.192 --> 46:02.150
but he said to just
come by for an hour

46:02.194 --> 46:03.325
and to bring you too.

46:03.369 --> 46:05.414
So, we can eat and
then do our work after.

46:05.458 --> 46:06.938
- Oh! You go.

46:06.981 --> 46:07.939
- Are you sure?

46:07.982 --> 46:09.679
You gotta meet him.
It'll be fun!

46:09.723 --> 46:11.029
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

46:11.072 --> 46:13.118
I got a lot of work to do
on the presentation.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.989
I'll take everything
over to my place.

46:15.033 --> 46:17.470
We'll eat there, go over
work when you get back.

46:23.215 --> 46:25.130
[Exhaling sharply]

46:29.177 --> 46:30.700
Wow!

46:30.744 --> 46:34.095
- I've had my eye on this dress,
these shoes and that purse

46:34.139 --> 46:35.270
for a long time,

46:35.314 --> 46:37.533
but they were always
just wishes till now.

46:37.577 --> 46:40.449
- I thought you didn't like
getting all dressed up.

46:40.493 --> 46:42.451
- Usually I don't,
but tonight, I thought:

46:42.495 --> 46:43.844
Why don't I just go for it?

46:43.888 --> 46:45.367
Can you help me
with the zipper?

46:45.411 --> 46:48.022
- Yeah, sure!
- Thanks!

46:54.072 --> 46:56.291
What, does this
make me look fat?

46:56.335 --> 46:58.641
- No! No, you
look beautiful.

46:58.685 --> 47:01.340
- It's the dress.
It's amazing!

47:01.383 --> 47:03.037
- It's not the dress.

47:07.433 --> 47:09.478
- Um, d-d-did you get it?

47:09.522 --> 47:10.697
- Yup!

47:10.740 --> 47:12.003
- [Laughing]: OK!

47:12.046 --> 47:13.656
I'm just gonna
go for an hour,

47:13.700 --> 47:15.833
and then I'll meet
you at your place.

Have fun tonight!

47:34.634 --> 47:38.681

building was torn down for this.

47:38.725 --> 47:40.509
- [Laughing]:
No, it's beautiful.

47:40.553 --> 47:42.903
- Speaking of which,
you look stunning!

47:42.947 --> 47:44.687
Thank you so
much for coming.

47:44.731 --> 47:48.213
- Well, you look wonderful too.
Thank you for inviting me.

47:48.256 --> 47:50.519
- Hey, where's your friend?

47:50.563 --> 47:52.913
- Oh, he had
some work to do,

47:52.957 --> 47:55.916
and he wasn't really in
the mood to go to a big party.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.222
- You know what?

47:58.745 --> 48:00.094
Neither am I.

Why don't you
let me show you

48:03.141 --> 48:05.273
the best part
about this building.

48:10.409 --> 48:11.889
- Wow! A green terrace!

48:11.932 --> 48:14.892
It's a little chilly,
but it's very impressive.

48:14.935 --> 48:17.068
- Oh, do you want my jacket?
- No.

48:18.591 --> 48:20.375
- So, families
can come up here.

48:20.419 --> 48:23.552
They can enjoy an oasis
right in the heart of the city.

48:23.596 --> 48:25.903
- I would love to work
at a place like this.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.600
- Well, that's the idea.

48:27.643 --> 48:30.733
You know, I think the way
we experience our environment,

48:30.777 --> 48:33.214
it affects every single
aspect of our lives.

48:33.258 --> 48:34.912
What's your
favourite design?

48:34.955 --> 48:37.392

The perfect shoe?

48:37.436 --> 48:39.960
- Mm-hmm!
- No! An orchid?

48:40.004 --> 48:43.224
Actually, years ago,
Martins Jewellers, downtown,

48:43.268 --> 48:45.618
they made this
heart-shaped necklace,

48:45.661 --> 48:47.750
and it just took
my breath away.

48:47.794 --> 48:48.926
- Hmm!

48:48.969 --> 48:51.145
- Even as a kid,
I wished I had it.

48:51.189 --> 48:52.494
What about you?

48:52.538 --> 48:54.670

list of them.

48:56.281 --> 48:58.936

of a Lamborghini,

48:58.979 --> 49:00.938

of Disney Hall,

Frank Lloyd Wright house.

for the foundation.

Thanks for bringing out
your lovely wife.

Are you up for a dance?

it's good to see you!

had my birthday.

I hope all your
wishes came true.

- Do you ever think that a
person's wishes can come true?

50:06.046 --> 50:10.137
- Well, I think that sometimes
something can suddenly appear,

50:10.181 --> 50:12.487
and it feels like magic.

50:12.531 --> 50:17.057

turn into an organic pumpkin.

What?

Do I have something
in my teeth?

just looking.

50:56.662 --> 50:58.229
I'm making my own wish.

51:09.936 --> 51:11.938
Is it OK that I did that?

- Yeah! It's more than OK.

It's nothing
like that at all.

It's just that I have to be on
a plane tomorrow to Boston,

and then after that, I go
to Indonesia to close a deal,

I'm gonna be back.

- Oh! No worries.
- What are you doing?

all the stuff from the past

protocols are laid out,

they're followed,

about the environment.

talking about?

in his New York office.

of digging about you.

you submitted over the years.

[Crickets chirping]

59:02.060 --> 59:05.063
Reed's coming over,
and tonight is gonna be perfect.

59:05.106 --> 59:07.195
OK, can you go set the table?
- Yeah.

59:07.239 --> 59:09.937
- Dad! I am having company over.

59:09.981 --> 59:12.592
They're gonna think
I'm a total slob!

59:12.636 --> 59:15.029
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey!
No worries! I'll do this.

59:15.073 --> 59:17.684
If there's one thing I know
how to do is set a table.

59:17.728 --> 59:20.208
[Laughing]: Uh, that dress
is a little tight, huh?

59:20.252 --> 59:21.688
- Dad!

- A little tight.

59:23.255 --> 59:24.691

59:24.735 --> 59:28.434
- With a kitchen like this,
cooking should be a snap!

59:28.477 --> 59:32.307
All right, what are we
making? OK, here we go.

59:32.351 --> 59:36.790
Coq au vin. Uh, first pare,
then julienne the vegetables.

59:36.834 --> 59:38.313
What does that mean?

59:38.357 --> 59:40.794
- No idea. I'm,
like, a microwave guy.

59:40.838 --> 59:43.318
- OK, just, let's go
to the next step.

59:43.362 --> 59:46.583
Take the chicken parts
and cook in a Dutch oven.

59:46.626 --> 59:47.888
Is that a Dutch oven?

59:47.932 --> 59:50.717

American, you know?

What do I do?

59:56.505 --> 59:58.638
- There is a pizza place
right next door.

- No! Gourmet Kitchen!
Can you order me some pasta?

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:04.252
Just, I don't know. Just make
it romantic! Can I trust you?

Dave, what are
you doing here?

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:23.532
- I guess you
didn't get my text.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:26.753
I was printing out copies of
the report. My printer jammed.

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:28.668
I was hoping
I could use yours.

01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:30.670

Yeah, come on in.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.328
I can just go
to a copy place.

- No, no.
I'm staying in.

01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.157
- You look fantastic.

- Oh, thank you!

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.508

company coming?

I don't wanna be in the way.
- No, you're not.

telling you about: Reed.

He's in from out of town,

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.952
so I thought he may
like a home-cooked meal,

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:54.781

warmed-up meal from takeout.

him upstairs?

The printer's in the
second room on the left.

01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:09.187
When you're done,
I'll introduce you to Reed.

go upstairs? OK, we're going!

- I feel really
bad about this.

Can't I just come in
and talk about it?

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:34.168
- Oh shit! Just come inside.
Come! Come inside!

you grab him?

- He's just showing you that
he likes you! He's so cute!

- Yeah, well, he'd be cuter
in your arms. Oh, hey!

me to get him?

done with this place.

it says a lot about you.

- Oh, well, it's
actually not exactly--

it's to die for! Thank you!

you doing?

how the real Italians do it.

mother used to say:

- Yo, Linds, this guy's actually
unreal at Call of Duty.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:29.849
He's gotta be some sort of,
like, Call of Dutywizard.

He sweats more than
you'd think, but I'm not--

- I'm sorry.
That's my brother.

01:03:35.594 --> 01:03:37.683
He's staying
here temporarily,

01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:41.121
and he's got a friend over,
and it's a long story.

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:43.167
- How's the pitch going?

01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:45.822
- Well, I found out today

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:48.737
that Woodhill really needs
the project to turn a profit

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.174
in 1 to 2 years,

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:52.567
and the way we have it
set up now is 3 to 5 years.

01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:54.569
- Can I have
a look at the specs?

01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:56.528
- Yeah, you don't mind?
- No! Let's go!

here in my purse right here.

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:03.927
Yeah!

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.539
- All right!

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.543
You know, with a couple
simple adjustments,

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:13.153
we can get this done.

01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:16.417
- But I don't wanna do anything
to compromise the project.

01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:18.506
- Listen, you can have
the perfect product,

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:21.509
but it won't do the environment
any good unless it gets funded.

01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:22.902
Sometimes,
a few minor tweaks

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.948
is what it takes to
get a project launched.

01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.559
OK!

very impressed.

wanna talk shop tonight.

each other a little more.

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:39.169
[Chuckling]

01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:40.692
And yet, through it all,

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:42.737
you're just so
humble and honest.

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:48.047
- That's what
people call me:

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.527
Honest Lindsay!

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.661
I'm fine! I'm fine!

01:06:53.705 --> 01:06:55.881
Just sometimes
I like to lead.

01:06:57.187 --> 01:06:58.275
- OK!

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.022
- OK, I'm done
leading now.

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.849
Actually, there's
part of my project

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.155
that I wanted
to show you,

01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:10.504
but it's in
the other room,

01:07:10.548 --> 01:07:12.158
so I'm just gonna
go and get it,

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:14.204
and you can just
stay here and sit.

01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:15.466
- Can I turn?

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:19.035
- [Whispering]: Billy!

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:21.602
- You're with him?
How could you?

01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:23.604
- I don't know what
your problem is.

01:07:23.648 --> 01:07:25.911
You need help!
- We're meant to be together!

01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:28.044
- Don't take one more step.
I'm warning you.

01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:29.219
- But I love you!

01:07:29.262 --> 01:07:32.570
- I finished
the handouts.

01:07:32.613 --> 01:07:35.181
- Dave Landry
from McKinley?

01:07:35.225 --> 01:07:37.183
- Dave, you remember
Billy Maddox?

01:07:37.227 --> 01:07:38.489
- Sure! Uh, Billy!

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:41.361
- What are you doing here?
No, don't tell me.

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:42.797
You're dating Lindsay too!

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:45.191
- What?
- You little--

01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:47.063
[Lindsay screaming]

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.108
- Stop!
- Lindsay, you all right?

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.240
- Yeah!

01:07:50.283 --> 01:07:52.068
- Uh, what's
going on here?

01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:54.244
- Isn't it obvious?

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:56.637
Lindsay's three-timing us!

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.030
- No!

01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:03.383
- I was so wrong
about you.

01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:06.517
You got a lot of
growing up to do.

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.003
- And you are?

01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:18.094
- Oh, Reed, yeah,
I was gonna introduce you.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.225
This is Dave
Landry. He's...

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.402
- A friend,
just a good friend.

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:23.837
- Mm-hmm!

01:08:23.881 --> 01:08:27.799
- I finished the handouts.
I'll see you tomorrow?

01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:29.844
- Dave! Dave, wait--

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:33.152
- What a sauce!
I love that restaurant!

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:35.067
Hello!

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:37.461
[Laughing
nervously]

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.290
- What restaurant?

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:42.118
[Car engine starting
in distance]

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:44.162
Why are all these
people in your house?

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:46.600
- Yeah, it's a--
It's a long story.

01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:47.688
- You say that a lot.

01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:49.341
I don't know what's
going on here,

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.865
and I think that
maybe tonight

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:53.041
was not the best night
for me to come over.

01:08:53.085 --> 01:08:54.478
- Oh, don't do that!

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.957
- You got a big
presentation tomorrow,

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:59.309
and I wanna thank you
for your dinner

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:00.962
I'll see you
in the office.

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:02.006
Yes!

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.051
[Mouthing]

01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:06.142
[Door opening and closing]

01:09:10.407 --> 01:09:12.148
- And as you can see,

01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:15.629
my 5-year projection plan
steadily increases with...

01:09:15.673 --> 01:09:17.501
[Phones ringing]

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:27.380
- Hey!

01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:28.685
- Hey!

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:30.904
- Thanks again for
your help last night.

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:33.473
I'm sorry it was so crazy.
- Yeah, it was.

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:34.734
- Are you OK?

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.301
- I'm fine.

01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:37.999
Kate's just wrapping up,

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:40.567
and by the looks of things,
it's not going great.

01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:42.220
You got a real
shot here.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.876
- Yeah! I just wanna talk
to you about the pitch,

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:46.834
'cause I made
a few small changes.

01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:48.749
- I'm sure it'll be OK.

01:09:48.792 --> 01:09:49.924
- Lindsay,
you're up!

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:52.318
- Reed! Hey, this
is Dave from last night.

01:09:52.362 --> 01:09:53.493
Dave represents PMI.

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:54.929
- Hey, Dave!
How are you?

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:57.323
- Reed, can I talk to you
for just one second.

01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:58.672
- Sure!
- Just one second.

01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:00.196
- Yeah!- What's up?

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:03.503
- Um, I'm sorry that everything
was so crazy last night.

01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:06.114
I'm sure that that
was the last of Billy,

01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:08.378
and Dave was just there
working on the project,

01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:11.598
and hopefully, my father and my
brother will be moving out soon,

01:10:11.642 --> 01:10:12.686
so I'm sorry.

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.558
- Well, you are
full of surprises.

01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:17.125
- I should have just told
you what was going on.

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:20.390
- It's OK. Knock
them dead in there!

01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:21.869
- OK!

01:10:21.913 --> 01:10:23.088
- Ms. Corwin!- Yes!

01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:24.263
- We're waiting.

01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:25.786
- All right!

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:30.095
- Good luck!

01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:31.401
- Hello!

01:10:31.444 --> 01:10:33.229
Can you
hold this?

01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:35.100
Thank you so much
Mr. Woodhill

01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:38.321
for giving us the opportunity
to speak today.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:41.759
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:44.283
welcome to the future
of solar energy.

01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:47.068
[â™ª Piano and percussion
on video â™ª]

01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:50.594
[Lindsay]: Simple solar cells
don't convert much electricity,

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:53.423
but with PMI's new design,
that's about to change.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.557
So, in conclusion,

01:10:57.601 --> 01:11:00.386
an efficient design
and cutting-edge technology

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.562
are clearly what
sets these solar panels

01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:04.085
apart from the pack.

01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:06.262
But a very wise person
once told me,

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:09.090
that to really go green,
you need the other green,

01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:10.309
which is profit.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.093
So by shortening
the testing period

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:15.314
and using dichromium panels
instead of the more costly ones,

01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:19.144
this project will have a
turnaround in not 3 to 5 years,

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:20.841
but in just under one.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:24.149
These panels will not only save
energy and help the environment,

01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:26.978
but they will quickly increase
GreenTree's bottom line,

01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:29.763
placing them at the forefront
of investment companies

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:30.764
for years to come.

01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:31.809
Thank you!

01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:41.035
- Congratulations, Lindsay,
or should I say Ms. President?

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:43.037
It has a nice ring to it.

01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:44.735
- [Laughing]:
Yes, it does! Yeah!

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.477
- [Man]:
Very good!

01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.610
- Congratulations,Lindsay!

01:11:50.654 --> 01:11:53.352
- Thank you! Thank you
so much! Thank you!

01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:55.311
[Men talking, indistinct]

01:11:57.008 --> 01:11:59.619
- Hey, Lindsay!
- [Man]: Keep me posted!

01:11:59.663 --> 01:12:01.186
- Hey!

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.320
- You knocked it
out of the park!

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:05.495
Congratulations!

01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:06.800
- Thank you!

01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:08.976
- Profitable, smart,
just what GreenTree needs!

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.370
You're in the big leagues now.
- With your help!

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:15.374
- Oh, hey! I was gonna give
you this last night, but...

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:16.854
Open it!

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.162
[Gasping]

01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:23.077
- It's the one
from Martins.

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:24.209
- Yup!

01:12:24.252 --> 01:12:26.167
- It's the one
I wished for.

01:12:26.211 --> 01:12:27.343
Wow! Thank you!

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:28.822
- You're welcome!

01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:30.476
Are you game
for Boston? Hmm?

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.566
I'll pick you up this afternoon.
We'll go to the airport?

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.612
- Absolutely! Yes!
- Awesome!

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:39.180
- Uh, give me
just one second?

01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:41.313
- Yeah, sure!
- Thank you! Thank you!

01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:45.099
Dave! Dave, what's wrong?

01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:48.102
- You don't know?
A profit in under a year?

01:12:48.146 --> 01:12:50.888
A change in the entire testings
and materials protocol?

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.933
- Well, they need
a quick return.

01:12:52.977 --> 01:12:54.587
It's the only way
to get it funded,

01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:56.502
and it doesn't
compromise the product!

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.417
- Yeah? Says who?
Mr. Right?

01:12:58.461 --> 01:13:00.245
- What good will
these solar panels do

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:01.899
if they never see
the light of day?

01:13:01.942 --> 01:13:03.161
Do you understand?

01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:05.381
- You've become
everything you wished for:

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:07.557
a corporate follower who
cares more about money

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.515
and looking good
for guys in flashy suits

01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:11.387
than what's really
important in life.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.692
I hope they
make you happy.

01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:14.520
- Dave, wait!

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:16.696
- You know, if you just
trusted yourself more,

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.959
you wouldn't have
to wish for everything.

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:21.266
But since you're
so good with wishes,

01:13:21.309 --> 01:13:22.398
wish me luck.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.182
- With what?

01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:29.405
- I thought you
were the one, Lindsay.

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:31.407
I could never say anything

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:34.801
because our friendship
meant everything to me.

01:13:34.845 --> 01:13:36.760
I tried dating
other women.

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:39.719
I couldn't shake the
feelings I have for you,

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.373
feelings I will
always have.

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:45.464
But I've been
in love with someone

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.815
too blind or too scared
to even see it.

01:13:51.035 --> 01:13:52.340
- Dave!

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:56.997
- I'm moving on with
my life now, Lindsay.

01:13:58.608 --> 01:14:01.306
I've got something
very important to do.

01:14:01.349 --> 01:14:02.786
[Elevator beeping]

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:08.487
[Sighing]

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:27.637
[Cow cawing, birds chirping]

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.126
- Hey! How'd it go?

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:43.348
- Um, well, the pitch went
great. What are you doing?

01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.393
- I assumed you
have good news,

01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:47.787
so I invited a few
people over to celebrate.

01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:49.659
- Uh-huh, a few people?

01:14:49.702 --> 01:14:51.138
- It'll be very low-key.

01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:53.140
You'll barely notice
there's people here.

01:14:53.184 --> 01:14:54.794
Also, the mail
came, by the way.

01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:56.927
There's something
from the IRS.

01:15:05.196 --> 01:15:06.589
[Sighing]

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:09.635
[Gasping]

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:12.638
- It's the taxes on my winnings.
They're--they're huge!

01:15:12.682 --> 01:15:14.814
The only way I can afford
to live in this house

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:16.076
is if I sell it!

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.992
- OK, you're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not!

01:15:19.036 --> 01:15:21.560

it's a little late,

01:17:12.236 --> 01:17:13.803
but I just wanted
to make sure

01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:16.632
that this was a birthday
that you'd never forget.

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:18.634

no chance of that!

01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:21.637

I am lucky, aren't I?

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:43.528
My good friend
told me that once...

my best friend.

Wait a minute!

01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:59.196
- What?

01:18:01.067 --> 01:18:03.374
- What, how could
I be so stupid?

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:06.507
I mean, it's been
there all along!

- What has?

01:18:09.859 --> 01:18:14.385
- The last wish:
to find my true love.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:20.565
- Uh, hang on
a second, Lindsay.

01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:23.611
- Reed, you are
really amazing,

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.570
and you're smart,
and you're talented,

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:26.919
and you're
so successful--

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:29.400
- Is this headed where
I think it's headed?

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:32.359
- But I can't go with you.
- Huh?

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:34.710
- I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:37.843
but you're everything
I ever wished for in a guy.

01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:39.192
- And?

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:41.891
- And I've been wishing
for the wrong guy.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:47.200
Thank you for
3 wonderful days,

01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:49.899
but I'm sorry,
Reed, I have to go.

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:51.204
- Yeah...

01:18:51.248 --> 01:18:52.858
- Oh, and can you
tell Woodhill

01:18:52.902 --> 01:18:55.208
he has one less
executive at GreenTree?

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:56.557
- What? Why?

01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:57.950
- Profits are great,

01:18:57.994 --> 01:19:00.605
but not when they come before
doing the right thing.

01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:02.563
I made a really
big mistake back there,

01:19:02.607 --> 01:19:04.609
and I'll be damned
if I make another one.

01:19:04.652 --> 01:19:07.873
Goodbye, Reed!
- Where are you going?

01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:10.136
- To the guy
I never wished for!

01:19:18.318 --> 01:19:20.059
- You know,
back in New York,

01:19:20.103 --> 01:19:22.061
this has become
my weekly ritual.

01:19:22.105 --> 01:19:23.149
- Yeah?

01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:25.412
- So, have you thought
about my offer?

01:19:25.456 --> 01:19:27.806
- I have, and I've
come to a decision.

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:30.766
- Tell you what, let's
climb first. You ready?

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:32.376
- I'll be there in a minute.

01:19:40.645 --> 01:19:42.299
- Dave!
Thank you!

01:19:44.518 --> 01:19:45.824
Dave!
- Lindsay?

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:48.087
- Yeah, your secretary
told me you were here.

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:50.611
- Is something wrong?
What happened?

01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:52.265
- No, no! Nothing like that.

01:19:52.309 --> 01:19:54.920
Um, tomorrow morning,
I'm quitting my job.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:57.618
I got blinded by
the wrong green,

01:19:57.662 --> 01:20:00.012
and the corporate world
wasn't for me.

01:20:00.056 --> 01:20:01.448
It never was.

01:20:01.492 --> 01:20:04.321
And I just said
good bye to Reed.

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:07.324
- What are you--
What are you saying?

01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:09.848
- That I'm an idiot!
I mean, you were right.

01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:11.937
I don't need wishes
to make me happy,

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:14.635
like getting a job promotion
or losing weight.

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.028
It doesn't
mean anything.

01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:17.813
And that big house?
That's not me!

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:20.728
But I finally realized that
I've had everything all along,

01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:22.208
and I just
didn't realize it.

01:20:22.252 --> 01:20:23.644
I didn't see it.

01:20:23.688 --> 01:20:26.473
And what's worse
is I didn't see you.

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:30.173
Dave, you're the one
that's always there for me,

01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:33.872
and you're the one that
I go to when I need help.

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:37.615
You're the one that
I can be me with, and...

01:20:39.704 --> 01:20:43.316
I'm so sorry it's taken
me so long to realize it,

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.101
but you are
my Mr. Right.

01:20:47.059 --> 01:20:48.713
You always have been.

01:20:52.064 --> 01:20:54.501
Dave, please don't
go to New York.

01:20:54.545 --> 01:20:57.548
- Lindsay, you suddenly
have this epiphany,

01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.376
I mean, just like that?

01:21:01.813 --> 01:21:05.817
I finally decided to
move on with my life.

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:10.474
What do you
expect me to say?

01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:13.390
I'm sorry...

are you doing?

than you were before.

I know! I know!

- I want us to be
together forever.

You were right
about everything.

mountains for you.

Please say something.

You ready to let go?

but I am ready to
start trusting myself.
