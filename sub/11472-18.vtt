Come on, you guys.
This is so stupid.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.740
No, this is not stupid.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.141
This is a tradition.

Can't wait to get
the new yearbook.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.292
I'm only gonna let
girls sign it,

02:06.326 --> 02:07.561
'cause that way,
when I have kids,

02:07.594 --> 02:09.596
they'll think
I was a big stud.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.599
I'll bet we'll find out
some girls have crushes on us.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.036
"Dear Sam, I've been in love
with you since September.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.538
"True love always..."

02:17.571 --> 02:19.405
No, they always write
the same thing.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.208
"Neal, you're a wild
and crazy guy."

02:22.242 --> 02:24.578
Never a wild and sexy guy.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.983
Yeah!

NEAL: Hey,
thanks a lot, guys!

02:31.618 --> 02:32.719
Real mature!

02:33.486 --> 02:36.489
I hate when they do this!

02:36.523 --> 02:39.492
I mean, why do jocks think
it's so funny?

02:39.526 --> 02:40.827
They think clean outs
are funny.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.063
They think wedgies are funny,

02:43.096 --> 02:45.398
they think swirlies are funny.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.934
Where do they find time
to play sports?

02:49.035 --> 02:51.204
I'm sick of being
called a geek.

02:51.237 --> 02:53.874
I mean, what's so geeky
about us, anyways?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.175
We're just guys.

We're gonna have fun
Friday night.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.757
Are you guys coming to
the disco on Friday night?

03:11.457 --> 03:12.859
Why would we do that?

03:12.893 --> 03:16.530
Well, because Nick is entering
the dance contest.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.866
Wow, really, Nick?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.168
Yeah, I guess so.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.904
All right, uh...
We better get going,

03:23.937 --> 03:26.272
'cause they're gonna be
reviewing for finals
and stuff.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.341
Oh, yeah, finals.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.843
Who cares, right?

03:31.411 --> 03:34.815
Right. Dave Fleury,
I hope you've studied.

03:34.848 --> 03:35.882
Yeah.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.183
So, are you like paying

03:37.217 --> 03:39.786
Dave Fleury to help you cheat,
or something?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.989
Uh, yeah, but, um,
don't tell anybody.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.791
Oh, no!

03:44.825 --> 03:46.326
I'd never do that!

03:48.128 --> 03:50.163
Ok, well,
we'll see you guys later.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.397
All right.
All right.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.433
All right,
see you guys later.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.836
What in the name
of God is going on?

03:59.405 --> 04:02.475
Oh, that is so sad.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.645
I don't know.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.779
Sara's cool.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.481
I'll bet he's probably hoping
that you get jealous.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.293
Oh, hey, you guys.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.295
Sorry 'bout the smoke.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.664
These things
are gonna kill me.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.498
I know I might look cool
with a cigarette in my hand,

04:25.532 --> 04:27.367
but, remember,
it's just a crutch.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.303
Don't forget that, got it?

04:30.336 --> 04:32.305
ALL: Yes, Mr. Fleck.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.407
How's tricks?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.009
We got cleaned out.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.378
Jocks?
Yeah, who else?

04:39.479 --> 04:41.447
Let me tell you something
about the jocks.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.949
Take a seat, fellas.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.519
Watch my hand.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.221
This is a graph
of their lives.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.991
Ooh, I'm in pee‐wee football!

04:51.024 --> 04:52.425
I'm pretty good.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.596
What? I can be first‐string
on a high school team,

04:55.629 --> 04:57.831
and get to wear
a jacket with leather sleeves?

04:57.864 --> 04:58.899
Hooray!

04:58.932 --> 05:02.068
Now, right there,
where they cleaned you out,

05:02.102 --> 05:05.271
that's the pinnacle
of their lives.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.908
Hey, I want
to play college ball.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.612
What? My GPA's not high enough
to get a sports scholarship?

05:11.645 --> 05:14.915
Ow, I just blew my knee out
during practice!

05:14.948 --> 05:18.418
Oops, I'm out of school
and selling used cars.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.420
What? I'm fired?

05:20.453 --> 05:22.789
Hand me that
bottle of booze, man.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.659
Now, let's take a look
at your lives, shall we?

05:25.692 --> 05:29.696
You get called geeks,
you get cleaned out,

05:29.730 --> 05:31.532
girls don't even look at you.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.534
I thought this was supposed
to make us feel better.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.502
Hold on, cool breeze,
it gets better.

05:35.536 --> 05:39.673
What? I'm accepted
at an Ivy League college?

05:39.706 --> 05:42.108
Hey, chicks dig smart guys!
Who knew?

05:42.142 --> 05:45.378
Whoa, look at me. I'm head
of a Fortune 500 company.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.549
And yes,
Mr. Jock‐Who‐Cleaned‐Me‐Out,

05:48.582 --> 05:50.383
I will have fries with that.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.852
But, wait!

05:51.885 --> 05:53.654
No, but that's like
a long time from now.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.322
We have to put up with this
for another three years.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.693
That's why you have
to learn to enjoy...

05:59.726 --> 06:02.028
The simple pleasures of life.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.567
A 16‐millimeter print of

06:06.600 --> 06:07.968

<i>and the Holy Grail?</i>

06:08.001 --> 06:09.335
Yup.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.538
Guys at A.V. at Lincoln
got it on loan
from the Air Force base,

06:11.572 --> 06:13.507
so I traded them a copy
of <i>Hemo the Magnificent.</i>

06:13.540 --> 06:16.342
It's ours for a week.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.445
A.V. is paradise
on earth.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.582
I'm so happy,
I think I'm gonna cry.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.722
All right, boys and girls,
come on, settle down.

06:28.755 --> 06:32.125
It's test time.
You know the rules.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.294
If you pass, you fly.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.998
If you fail, you get
to look at my pretty face
again next year.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.773
Hey.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.809
Where's Dave Fleury?

06:48.842 --> 06:49.910
He's never late.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.311
Didn't you hear?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.279
Broke his arm
in gym this morning.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.816
Fell off the ropes
and missed the mat.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.518
It was hilarious.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.833
Hey!

07:16.469 --> 07:18.171
Better be a fire, bro.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.878
Think you're pretty cool,
don't you, Mr. Desario?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.281
No, I don't
think I'm cool.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.616
Yeah?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.519
You don't think you're
the Fonz or something?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.120
If a jukebox was broken,

07:34.154 --> 07:36.523
think you could hit it
and it'd start playing?

07:38.058 --> 07:40.561
I feel like we've
been here before, Daniel.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.629
I'm a nice guy.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.331
But you know
when I stop being nice?

07:45.365 --> 07:47.834
When people take advantage
of my niceness,

07:47.868 --> 07:50.070
and that's what
you've been doing.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.638
So guess what?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.807
I'm not gonna
be nice right now.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.577
How do you like them apples?

07:58.044 --> 07:59.780
I like them fine, sir.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.415
Ok, cool guy.

08:02.448 --> 08:03.850
I've got a real
cool way for you

08:03.884 --> 08:05.652
to spend the rest of
the school year.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.755
You're now in A.V.
Congratulations.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.392
I have an announcement

08:12.425 --> 08:16.462
that is going to make someone
in this room very, very happy.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.564
You're quitting?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.932
(CLASS TITTERS)

08:19.432 --> 08:22.536
No, Ms. Kelly.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.438
Every year,
the University of Michigan

08:25.471 --> 08:28.609
picks from the top 1% of
the students in the state

08:28.642 --> 08:31.612
to take part in
an academic summit,

08:31.645 --> 08:36.917
and it seems that
our very own Lindsay Weir

08:36.950 --> 08:38.852
has been selected.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.792
What's an academic summit?

08:45.826 --> 08:49.362
Two glorious weeks
at the U of M campus,

08:49.395 --> 08:54.635
reading, debating,
matching wits
with the best and brightest

08:54.668 --> 08:56.369
students in Michigan.

08:56.402 --> 08:57.971
You'll be ranked daily.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.341
There'll be competitions
and rivalries.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.645
Oh, you are one lucky girl!

09:07.413 --> 09:08.949
Well?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.751
What do you have
to say about that?

09:17.257 --> 09:18.291
Um...

09:20.093 --> 09:21.662
I'm one lucky girl?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.872
See, here's
the weird thing.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.207
Ok, usually
students are happy

09:34.240 --> 09:37.744
about being selected
to attend the academic summit.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.312
How can I be
in the top 1%?

09:39.345 --> 09:40.747
I don't study
that much.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.949
I mean, are the kids in
Michigan schools that stupid?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.652
No, you're
just that smart.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.621
(SIGHS)

09:49.523 --> 09:52.926
Maybe you're tired
and broken.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.261
Your tongue is twisted
with words half‐spoken

09:55.295 --> 09:57.330
and thoughts unclear.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.399
What do you
want me to do?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.002
To do for you,
to see you through?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.670
Why are you
talking like that?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.772
Just quoting the Dead.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.273
I know it always
makes me feel better.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.510
Quoting the who?

10:09.543 --> 10:13.146
Not The Who. Ha ha.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.280
The Grateful Dead.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.718
When I was in college,
back in the early 1700s,

10:18.484 --> 10:19.820
I'd put their album

10:19.853 --> 10:22.088
American Beauty on
whenever I was stressing out.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.724
It always helped.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.761
You know what?

10:27.794 --> 10:30.196
I'm gonna loan it to you.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.767
Put it on while
you're studying for finals,

10:33.800 --> 10:38.772
and soon you'll be rarin' to
go to that academic summit.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.112
I got kinda woozy

10:46.146 --> 10:48.782
when I had to show that girls'
time of the month film.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.752
They didn't even let me into
the class to show that one.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.820
They said the girls would be
too embarrassed.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.690
I head that's because you get
to see a girl's boobs in it.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.665
All right, fellas,

11:04.698 --> 11:06.533

happy little A.V. family

get a new addition.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.705
Daniel Desario is going
to be joining us here

11:11.738 --> 11:13.173
for the rest of the year.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.142
Why?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.744
Well, I guess he was
having a little trouble,

11:17.778 --> 11:20.013
and Mr. Rosso thought
that a stay in A.V.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.948
might be a good
attitude adjustment for him.

11:22.616 --> 11:23.784
Wait a minute.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.086
He's putting him
in A.V. as punishment?

Hey, Daniel,
how's it going?

11:42.703 --> 11:44.170
Fine.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.007
Hey, Daniel, do you
know how to fix a projector?

11:48.474 --> 11:49.475
No.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.946
We can teach ya.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.348
Great.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.352
This is terrible.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.523
Daniel's gonna ruin the
only place we like in school.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.591
Yeah, why did Mr. Rosso
do this to us?

12:04.625 --> 12:07.360
I'll be that Daniel guy
is high on drugs,

12:07.393 --> 12:08.595
and if we make him angry,

12:08.629 --> 12:10.463
he'll freak out and
wreck the A.V. room.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.398
Oh, no!
No, he won't.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.734
He's not a bad guy.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.769
I mean, he's friends
with my sister.

12:15.802 --> 12:16.870
I've talked to him.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.438
Sam, he gave you a porno.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.673
I wouldn't exactly say

12:19.706 --> 12:21.274
you have a meaningful
relationship with him.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.545
Um, none of us really know
him that well, Neal.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.046
All I know is what
we've gotta do

12:26.079 --> 12:28.549
is get him
to show movies every day.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.552
It's the only way
we'll be able to get rid
of him. Agreed?

12:31.585 --> 12:32.953
Agreed.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.795
Lindsay, I understand
congratulations are in order.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.564
Welcome to the 1% club.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.632
I was one back in 1956.

12:45.666 --> 12:47.067
Look what it did for me!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.269
Thank you.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.673
Oh! Oh, my God!
I am so sorry!

12:52.706 --> 12:53.774
That was my fault!

12:53.807 --> 12:55.308
That was me!
I'm the clumsy clod!

Oh, yeah,
that's what I've heard.

Are you a deadhead?

13:10.023 --> 13:14.828
Um...No. I‐‐someone just gave
it to me to listen to.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.429
Oh, well, if you
never heard it before,

13:16.462 --> 13:17.764
you're in for a treat,

13:17.798 --> 13:20.400
'cause it's like the best
album of all time.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.535
Really?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.603
GIRL: Yeah.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.904
Is it that great?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.405
I wish I'd never heard it,

13:25.438 --> 13:28.374
just so I could hear it again
for the first time.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.515
This is such
a cool vest, Kenny.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.217
Kenny?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.052
Why don't you come over
to Nick's after school?

13:39.085 --> 13:40.921
We're gonna go over
some new dance moves.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.990
I don't think so.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.359
Uh, Ken doesn't
really like to dance.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.428
Oh, well, Kenny,

13:48.461 --> 13:50.063
that's just because
you don't know how.

13:50.096 --> 13:53.333
I taught Nick how to do the
hustle in less than an hour.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.334
And you know what?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.002
You'll probably learn
even faster than that,

13:56.036 --> 13:57.571
because you'll have both of us
teaching you at the same time.

13:58.639 --> 14:01.341
Um... No?

14:02.208 --> 14:03.877
Ok, your loss.

Um, do you guys
want anything?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.581
I'm gonna go
get some more milk.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.949
No, I'm ok.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.216
I'll be right back, baby.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.251
Ok, I'll be here.

Come on. That's
my girlfriend, man.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.267
Do I need to remind you
that you used to hate disco?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.670
Look, what's the
difference between

14:29.703 --> 14:32.005
Zeppelin and disco really?

14:32.038 --> 14:34.641
No, listen, they both
have heavy drums

14:34.675 --> 14:35.876
and they have bass.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.544
Have you heard that foxy song,
<i>Hot Number?</i>

14:37.578 --> 14:38.845
It rocks, man.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.948
No, I don't know
that song, thank God.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.285
But I can
guarantee it sucks.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.853
All right, you know
what sucks, man?

14:46.887 --> 14:47.921
You suck.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.490
No, I've been
trying really hard

14:50.524 --> 14:52.626
to get a decent girlfriend
for a long time.

And now I've got one,
and you're being a real jerk.

Nick, you are only
going out with Sara

to make Lindsay jealous,

14:59.866 --> 15:02.536
and it isn't working.

Mr. Zeffirelli's masterpiece,

the roles were played
by actors well into their 30s,

an artificial feel.

running down to the pit,

24:39.312 --> 24:41.081
What's eating you?

24:41.114 --> 24:43.550
Huh? Nothing.

24:43.584 --> 24:46.419
I just wish I didn't get into
that academic summit.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.555
Feels like I'm going
back into school again.

24:48.589 --> 24:50.223
Life's tough.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.458
What's that
supposed to mean?

24:52.492 --> 24:54.160
It means you've
been moping around

24:54.194 --> 24:56.830
ever since you found out you
got into that stupid thing.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.666
At least you get to get out of
this town for a little while.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.434
Kim, it's
summer vacation.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.236
You can go
out of town, too.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.538
You can go
anywhere you want.

25:04.571 --> 25:07.307
No, I can't, Lindsay.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.375
I don't have any money.

25:09.409 --> 25:13.446
And besides, Daniel never
wants to go anywhere, anyway.

25:13.479 --> 25:14.581
So?

25:14.615 --> 25:16.750
Go without him.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.585
You don't
have to stay here.

25:18.619 --> 25:20.220
You know that, Kim.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.656
That's easy
for you to say, Lindsay,

25:22.689 --> 25:24.290
'cause you get to leave.

25:24.825 --> 25:25.892
I don't.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.165
(DYNASTY'S I DON'T
WANT TO BE A FREAK PLAYS)

25:32.198 --> 25:34.167
Come on, Nick,
you promised me.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.203
I know. I'm just kinda
freaked out about it.

25:37.237 --> 25:38.672
I'm not that
good at contests.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.508
Nick, you are
a great dancer.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.510
Ok? You're
really, really good.

25:43.544 --> 25:45.178
And I swear, I'm
not just saying that.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.479
Thanks.

25:46.513 --> 25:49.616
It's weird.
I used to hate disco.

25:49.650 --> 25:53.820
But I guess maybe
I was just destined for it.

25:53.854 --> 25:55.021
Yeah!

25:55.055 --> 25:57.423
(LAUGHS) Totally.

25:57.457 --> 26:02.062
Sometimes you end up being
the best at something
you hate.

26:02.095 --> 26:03.196
Mm‐hmm.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.731
Like Lindsay.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.933
She hates math, but she's
the head of the mathletes.

26:10.904 --> 26:14.274
Nick, do you
still like Lindsay?

26:14.908 --> 26:16.342
No, no.

26:18.612 --> 26:21.347
I mean, I still
care about her.

26:24.384 --> 26:26.587
Look, I really
like you, Sara.

26:34.227 --> 26:37.097
I've had a crush on you
since the sixth grade.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.265
Really?

26:39.299 --> 26:40.734
I always sat behind you,

26:40.767 --> 26:44.137
even though you were so tall
I couldn't see the board.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.673
Wow.

26:46.707 --> 26:51.277
I just‐‐ I can't
believe that you like me.

26:51.311 --> 26:52.713
Oh...

26:55.115 --> 26:57.884
Tonight's D&D campaign
is gonna be the best ever.

26:57.918 --> 27:00.386
Two words: ancient Babylonia.

27:00.420 --> 27:03.223
Have you guys seen the drawing
of the goddess Ishtar?

27:03.256 --> 27:04.891
Hubba hubba!

27:04.925 --> 27:06.492
BILL: You should look
at the goddess of vice.

27:06.527 --> 27:07.961
You can see her butt.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.931
I just hope you guys are ready
to face the Dancing Sword.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.766
NEAL: Bring it on!
GORDON: Yeah!

27:12.799 --> 27:14.134
What's a Dancing Sword?

27:16.469 --> 27:17.838
Well, it's like‐‐

27:17.871 --> 27:20.406
It's a sword that can fight
without you holding it.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.643
What, you just send your
sword into battle for you,

27:22.676 --> 27:24.611
and then you stay home?

27:24.645 --> 27:26.046
That's kind of stupid.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.448
No, no, you have to be
at least three inches away

27:28.481 --> 27:29.816
from it when
it's fighting.

27:29.850 --> 27:32.052
That way you can
fight two people at once.

27:34.254 --> 27:35.355
That's kinda cool.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.559
Hey, Daniel.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.727
We're playing D&D tonight.
You wanna come?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.131
Why?

27:45.165 --> 27:47.601
I think you'd like it.
We could show you how to play.

27:47.634 --> 27:48.935
I couldn't do that.

27:48.969 --> 27:50.470
Yeah, you wouldn't
like it anyway.

27:50.504 --> 27:51.672
It's really boring.

27:51.705 --> 27:54.074
No. No, it isn't, Neal.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.008
You love it.

27:55.041 --> 27:58.011
We sit around
and crack jokes

27:58.044 --> 28:01.014
and eat junk food
all night while we're...

28:01.047 --> 28:03.517
fighting dragons and saving
princesses and stuff.

28:03.550 --> 28:04.851
It's pretty fun.

28:04.885 --> 28:06.553
And the best part is,

28:06.587 --> 28:08.221
you get to pretend
to be somebody

28:08.254 --> 28:09.756
you can't be in real life.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.794
Ok, I'll play.

28:15.962 --> 28:16.963
Really?

28:17.831 --> 28:19.165
Yeah, I'll play.

28:19.199 --> 28:23.069
Just... Don't expect me to be
good at it or anything.

28:23.103 --> 28:24.938
You can't possibly
be any worse than Bill.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.006
Hey!

28:26.039 --> 28:28.208
So, Sam, how 'bout you?
Are you in?

28:34.848 --> 28:37.083
Yeah, I guess.

28:37.117 --> 28:40.320
Thought you were
too cool to play...

28:40.353 --> 28:42.055
Logan the Huge.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.798
Ken, no.
We shouldn't be here.

28:51.832 --> 28:53.667
Just let Nick
do what he wants!

28:53.700 --> 28:55.802
I can't do that.
The poor guy's brainwashed.

28:55.836 --> 28:58.204
I can't let him dance
in this stupid contest.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.406
It goes against everything
that we stand for.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.742
Well, I'm not
gonna stop him.

29:01.775 --> 29:03.209
Just talk to him!

29:03.243 --> 29:05.679
At least tell him that he
doesn't have a chance
with you

29:05.712 --> 29:06.980
so he'll break up
with Sara!

29:07.013 --> 29:09.683
No, it's not
gonna work.

29:09.716 --> 29:11.652
Look! Kenny and Lindsay
came to cheer you on!

29:11.685 --> 29:13.887
That is so cool!
Hey, guys!

29:13.920 --> 29:16.823
Hey, Nick.
Lindsay has something
she wants to tell you.

29:16.857 --> 29:18.291
No, I don't.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.459
Yes, you do!

29:19.492 --> 29:20.894
Ken, stop it!

29:20.927 --> 29:22.829
Oh, check it out, kids.

29:22.863 --> 29:27.267
It's our little opinionated
rock 'n roller friend.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.071
Who the hell's
he talkin' about?

29:31.104 --> 29:33.239
I think he's talking
about you.

29:40.714 --> 29:42.248
Uh... So what do I do?

29:42.282 --> 29:44.150
First you have to
create a character.

29:44.184 --> 29:46.319
Roll your dice and find out
what your ability scores are.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.420
What are those?

29:47.453 --> 29:50.156
Well, that tells you
if you're strong or smart

29:50.190 --> 29:52.458
or how good you are
with a weapon.

29:53.660 --> 29:56.262
What are you, some...
super smart guy?

29:56.296 --> 29:58.532
Oh, I don't have a character.
I'm the dungeon master.

29:58.565 --> 29:59.933
I control the game

29:59.966 --> 30:01.902
and act out all the characters
you'll meet along the way.

30:01.935 --> 30:04.538
And Daniel,
watch out for him.

30:04.571 --> 30:05.772
He's sneaky.

30:05.806 --> 30:07.908
Yeah. Yeah, he thinks
being the dungeon master

30:07.941 --> 30:10.310
gives him a license
to mess with our heads.

30:10.343 --> 30:12.178
Oh, I'm sorry.
Perhaps I should let you

30:12.212 --> 30:15.015
encounter kittens and grandmas
so as not to upset you.

30:15.048 --> 30:16.983
Come on, Daniel,
roll the dice.

30:17.017 --> 30:19.419
I wanna see what
your character's gonna be.

30:19.452 --> 30:20.554
All right.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.691
Here goes nothin'.

30:24.725 --> 30:26.793
Hey, man, aren't you
one of those guys

30:26.827 --> 30:28.695
who's always
yellin' in here

30:28.729 --> 30:30.597
that disco sucks?

30:30.631 --> 30:32.533
What's the matter?

30:32.566 --> 30:35.001
Cat got your bong, man?

30:35.035 --> 30:37.103
Is that how you learned
to communicate,

30:37.137 --> 30:38.939
runnin' in here,
yellin' stuff?

30:38.972 --> 30:43.309
Is that what your precious
rock teaches you, friend?

30:43.343 --> 30:45.812
Um... No, man.
It teaches me that...

30:45.846 --> 30:47.648
disco sucks!

30:47.681 --> 30:48.915
Ken, don't, all right?

30:48.949 --> 30:52.218
I say that rock 'n roll
sucks, ok?

30:52.252 --> 30:55.689
Hey, have you heard
the Stones'
new song <i>Miss You?</i>

30:55.722 --> 30:58.058
Well, guess what?
It's disco, man.

30:58.091 --> 31:00.661
Even the Stones know it.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.930
They're willing to admit it.
Why can't you?

31:03.964 --> 31:06.132
This place is empty, man!

31:06.166 --> 31:08.535
Disco is dead. Give it up!
Why don't you

31:08.569 --> 31:11.705
go back to sellin' shirts
at the mall there, buddy?

31:11.738 --> 31:13.406
All right, pal. Let's go.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.941
Great. Thanks a lot, man.

31:14.975 --> 31:17.578
Disco is alive!
It's alive, I tell you!

31:17.611 --> 31:19.913
I know it...
And you know it...

31:19.946 --> 31:23.817
and miss Gloria Gaynor
knows it, too!

31:23.850 --> 31:27.588
(GLORIA GAYNOR'S
I WILL SURVIVE PLAYS)

31:31.792 --> 31:34.761
Where the hell is Daniel
when you need him?

31:34.795 --> 31:37.363
A dwarf? I don't
wanna be a dwarf.

31:37.397 --> 31:40.734
I wanted to be, like,
a ninja or a fighter.

31:40.767 --> 31:43.704
Well, dwarves are fighters.
They're really good at it.

31:43.737 --> 31:44.938
(SIGHS)

31:47.340 --> 31:48.174
Are you a dwarf?

31:48.208 --> 31:51.011
No. I'm Kragenmore
the Destroyer.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.713
You're lucky, man.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.981
I wanna be some
huge destroyer guy.

31:55.015 --> 31:56.983
Dwarfs can do a lot of things
that huge guys can't do.

31:57.017 --> 31:59.385
It's true.
Take it from me.

31:59.419 --> 32:02.923
Yeah, dwarfs are really tough.
They're good
at finding jewels.

32:02.956 --> 32:04.825
All right, fine.
I'll be a dwarf.

32:04.858 --> 32:07.460
But my name is Carlos.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.695
(SNICKERS)

32:08.729 --> 32:10.030
Carlos the Dwarf?

32:10.063 --> 32:12.699
Yeah, you got a problem
with that, Gorthon?

32:14.134 --> 32:15.135
No.

32:15.902 --> 32:17.437
I'm just jokin'.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.242
Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for
embarrassing me in there.

32:22.275 --> 32:24.110
I gotta go dance in front
of those people now!

32:24.144 --> 32:25.712
Best of luck, man.
I mean it!

32:25.746 --> 32:28.481
Gimme a call when you get over
your Saturday night fever.

32:28.515 --> 32:31.985
And you're too tall
to be a good dancer!

32:32.018 --> 32:34.621
Hey, I agree with you, man.
That place sucks.

32:34.655 --> 32:37.123
And you're right. They're
closin' the disco next week

32:37.157 --> 32:38.759
and bringin' in foxy boxin'.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.493
You should come back
and check it out.

32:40.527 --> 32:42.328
(WHISPERS)
Rock 'n' roll!

32:47.133 --> 32:49.002
What is wrong with that guy?
Why does he

32:49.035 --> 32:50.537
have to give me such
a hard time about this?

32:50.571 --> 32:53.206
Ken's just confused.
He's thinks you're doing
all this stuff

32:53.239 --> 32:56.710
to... I don't know.
To get me back.

32:56.743 --> 32:58.211
Well, that's not true.

32:58.244 --> 33:01.147
That's what I told him,
but he doesn't want to listen.

33:01.882 --> 33:03.684
I mean,
I'm with Sara now.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.318
You know?

33:05.351 --> 33:08.555
I'm not some idiot.
You told me to move on.

33:08.589 --> 33:09.990
And so I did.

33:10.724 --> 33:11.858
Yeah!

33:11.892 --> 33:13.226
I know.

33:14.027 --> 33:16.129
I think it's great.

33:16.162 --> 33:19.099
Well, it is great. I mean,
Sara's the best, you know?

33:19.132 --> 33:21.935
She opened me up to
all sorts of new things,

33:21.968 --> 33:23.637
and she loves me.

33:24.771 --> 33:26.406
I mean, that's important.

33:26.807 --> 33:28.408
It is.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.711
I'm really happy
for you, Nick.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.717
Well, you should be,
you know?

33:36.750 --> 33:38.552
I even quit smoking pot.

33:38.585 --> 33:41.555
Yeah. I don't even
really want it anymore.

33:41.588 --> 33:44.357
It's like I totally
cleaned myself up.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.491
Wow!

33:46.026 --> 33:47.260
Really?

33:47.293 --> 33:48.529
Mm‐hmm.

33:48.562 --> 33:52.265
God, that's‐‐I knew
there was something different.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.968
That's so great.

33:55.001 --> 33:56.336
You seem like
you're having

33:56.369 --> 33:59.272
way more fun with her
than you ever did with me.

34:01.007 --> 34:02.308
Yeah.

34:03.443 --> 34:04.645
I mean, I am.

34:08.081 --> 34:11.317
Well, I...
gotta get going.

34:11.351 --> 34:14.087
I have a lot of studying to do
for that academic summit.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.189
I should probably start
studying for finals.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.626
Oh, yeah.
I should do that, too.

34:19.660 --> 34:23.129
First I gotta win
this dance contest.
(CHUCKLES)

34:24.798 --> 34:26.199
Hey, good luck.

34:27.734 --> 34:29.035
Thanks.

34:29.069 --> 34:30.771
DISCO DEEJAY:
Ok, all right, everybody.

34:30.804 --> 34:33.139
We're gonna shake
our groove things

34:33.173 --> 34:36.076
tonight here at
Frontier Lanes.

34:36.109 --> 34:38.111
It's time for the big
disco contest,

34:38.144 --> 34:41.047
and let's bring up our first
