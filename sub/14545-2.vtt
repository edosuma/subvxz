WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.736
(Tessa) IT TOOK ME
A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

00:02.803 --> 00:06.006
BUT I FINALLY FOUND MY FAVORITE
THING TO DO IN THE SUBURBS--

00:06.074 --> 00:07.007
SLEEP.

00:07.075 --> 00:08.942
(knock on door)

00:09.009 --> 00:12.280
TESSA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LET'S GO, BEFORE SHE GETS HERE.

00:14.782 --> 00:15.883
SHE STILL WATERING?

00:15.949 --> 00:17.751
(mumbles) STILL WATERING.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.220
WHY DIDN'T YOU SET AN ALARM?

00:19.287 --> 00:20.621
I KEPT HITTING SNOOZE.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.624
I WAS HAVING THE MOST AMAZING
DREAM ABOUT MANHATTAN.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.093
YEAH? WHAT WAS SO AMAZING?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.760
WE WERE STILL LIVING THERE.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.062
HA HA.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.697
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE--

00:29.763 --> 00:33.067
SHEILA'S CONSTANT INVITATIONS
TO DINNER EVERY SINGLE MORNING.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.069
I'M RUNNING OUT OF
CREATIVE WAYS TO SAY NO.

00:35.136 --> 00:39.407
HAVE YOU TRIED RUNNING HER OVER
WITH YOUR CAR? THAT'S CREATIVE.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.943
(squeaks)

00:43.010 --> 00:46.180
OH, NO. HOSE IS OFF.
SHE'S COMING, SHE'S COMING!

00:46.247 --> 00:47.748
MY BACKPACK! IT'S UPSTAIRS!

00:47.815 --> 00:49.683
NO TIME! GO! GO!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.367
UHH!

01:14.308 --> 01:17.611
(George, lowered voice)
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.946
AAH!

01:19.012 --> 01:21.382
I'M STUCK. SAVE YOURSELF.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.217
GO!

01:23.284 --> 01:25.686
NO, DAD. I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.088
TESSA, GO.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.657
(whispers) JUST GO.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.830
(George groans)

01:36.897 --> 01:38.266
WELL, HIYA, NEIGHBOR!

01:38.332 --> 01:40.000
DINNER TONIGHT?

01:40.067 --> 01:43.504
(sighing)

01:43.571 --> 01:45.506
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

01:45.573 --> 01:50.411

A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

01:50.478 --> 01:53.514
* LA-DA-DA-DA, DA, DA, DA, DA *

BIOSCIENTISTS HAVE DETERMINED
THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE AN ANIMAL

01:57.385 --> 01:58.986
FROM ITS INDIGENOUS
ENVIRONMENT--

01:59.052 --> 02:01.755
FOR EXAMPLE,
THE GENTOO PENGUIN--

02:01.822 --> 02:04.258
AND DEPOSIT SAID ANIMAL

02:04.325 --> 02:06.360
INTO A REGION
THAT IT'S NOT ACCUSTOMED TO,

02:06.427 --> 02:11.131
IT IS FAR MORE SUSCEPTIBLE
TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.567
ANY QUESTIONS?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.269
YES, DALIA.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.238
I HATE BIRDS.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.706
THANK YOU, DALIA.

02:18.772 --> 02:23.444
I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF THAT,
AS BAD AS I HAD IT,

02:23.511 --> 02:26.914
THE GENTOO PENGUIN
HAD IT WORSE.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.050
(indistinct conversations)

02:30.117 --> 02:31.185
OH!

02:31.252 --> 02:32.986
HEY, LISA.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.556
I HEARD THAT YOUR FAMILY WAS
COMING OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

02:35.623 --> 02:38.992
AND I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
IN ADVANCE FOR MY FAMILY.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.394
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.796
YOUR FAMILY'S NEVER AS BAD
AS YOU THINK THEY ARE.

02:42.863 --> 02:43.664
(Ryan) HEY, LISA!

02:43.731 --> 02:47.235
THIS IS HOW DAD
DOES IT TO MOM.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.743
UNLESS THEY ARE.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.178
YOU READY TO DO THIS?

02:58.246 --> 02:59.747
WAIT.
BEFORE WE GO OVER THERE,

02:59.813 --> 03:02.216
WE SHOULD REALLY FIGURE OUT
AN EXIT STRATEGY.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.784
OH, THAT'S SMART.
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.419
AFTER DESSERT,
I'LL SAY WE'D BETTER GO

03:05.486 --> 03:07.621
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO STUDY
FOR A MATH TEST TOMORROW.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.822
COME ON, DAD!

03:08.889 --> 03:11.359
I DON'T HAVE TO STUDY.
I KNOW EVERYTHING ALREADY.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.494
YOU SAID THAT LAST TIME,
YOUNG LADY,

03:13.561 --> 03:16.196
AND YOU ENDED UP WITH A "D"!

03:16.264 --> 03:17.798
(dog barking in distance)
GOOD.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.733
THAT FELT GOOD.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.504
BUT WHAT IF IT'S BEFORE DESSERT,
AND ONE OF US CAN'T TAKE IT?

03:23.571 --> 03:25.606
I THINK WE NEED
A CODE WORD.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.275
UH, "PICKLES."

03:28.141 --> 03:29.243
"PICKLES"?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.678
WHAT,
YOU GOT SOMETHING BETTER?

03:30.744 --> 03:31.979
FINE. "PICKLES."

03:32.045 --> 03:33.614
ONE OF US CITES "PICKLES,"

03:33.681 --> 03:37.217
THE OTHER CITES IRRITABLE BOWEL,
AND WE'RE GONE. GOT IT?

03:37.285 --> 03:41.322
GOT IT. (sighs)
LET'S DO THIS.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.392
WHAT IS KEEPING YOU TWO?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.759
(smacking lips)

03:45.826 --> 03:49.430
(silverware clinks)

03:49.497 --> 03:51.299
DO YOU WANT YOUR BONES?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.166
YES.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.069
SO, GEORGE, YOU NEVER DID SAY
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR WIFE.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.606
FRED!
IT'S AN HONEST QUESTION.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.608
IF GEORGE WANTS,
HE CAN SAY "NO COMMENT."

04:00.674 --> 04:02.142
NO COMMENT.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.844
(Sheila and Fred laugh)

04:03.911 --> 04:05.513
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:05.579 --> 04:08.482
UH, WE SEPARATED
15 YEARS AGO.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.917
I SAW THIS SHOW ONCE

04:09.983 --> 04:12.286
WHERE THESE TWINS ATTACHED
AT THE FACE WERE SEPARATED.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.788
IT WAS AWESOME.
I THINK ONE OF 'EM DIED.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.391
I SAW THAT, TOO.
I THINK ONE OF 'EM DID DIE.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.293
(Fred and Ryan laugh)

04:19.360 --> 04:20.794
ARE YOU ALL DONE HERE,
HONEY?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.664
SO BACK TO GEORGE'S
FAILED MARRIAGE. YOU CHEAT?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.899
DAD?
I WOULD NEVER DREAM
OF CHEATING ON SHEILA.

04:25.966 --> 04:29.870
COULDN'T. SHE WATCHES ME
LIKE A HAWK... AND I LOVE IT.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.904
(slap)
WHOO! (laughs)

04:30.971 --> 04:34.742
MAY I BE EXCUSED?
HAVING A TERRIBLE TIME.

04:34.808 --> 04:35.909
WHAT ABOUT DESSERT?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.044
LISA CAN'T HAVE DESSERT.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.245
WHY--WHY NOT? THE SUGAR?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.047
NO.
(doorbell rings)

04:40.113 --> 04:42.683
OH! I GOT IT. IT'S FOR ME.
LISA HAS NO FRIENDS.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.285
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, HONEY.
YOU HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.854
(mouths words)
(door opens)

04:46.920 --> 04:48.088
WE'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.758
HEY, UH, CAREFUL NOT TO
SET OFF THE SMOKE DETECTOR

04:50.824 --> 04:52.292
WITH THE GUN SHOW.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.896
(Sheila) OOH! (laughs)

04:55.963 --> 04:57.197
YOU GIRLS WANT TO JOIN?

04:57.264 --> 04:59.933
OH, NO, THANK YOU. I DON'T
WANT TO SEE THE GUN SHOW.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.101
I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.103
COME NOW. YOU GUYS HEAD ON
DOWN TO THE RUMPUS ROOM.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.439
FRED AND I HAVE SOME
GROWN-UP QUESTIONS FOR GEORGE.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.908
OOH. UH, CAN I GO DOWN
TO THE RUMPUS ROOM, TOO?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.177
(both laugh)

05:10.243 --> 05:11.679
NO, YOU MAY NOT.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.447
***

05:13.514 --> 05:15.549
(rattling, bell dinging)

05:15.616 --> 05:18.586
JOEY. TRUTH OR DARE?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.355
MAYBE I DID SOMETHING WRONG
IN A PREVIOUS LIFE.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.724
MAYBE I WAS EVA BRAUN.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.127
RYAN. TRUTH OR DARE?
WAIT. OKAY, DARE.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.730
I HAVE SOME CHOCOLATE
IN MY ROOM. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.566
I DARE YOU TO KISS A LESBIAN.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.435
I'M NOT KISSING MY SISTER.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.470
NOT YOUR SISTER,
YOU IDIOT--HER.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.938
(pinball rolling)

05:38.005 --> 05:39.907
TESSA.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.008
***

05:41.074 --> 05:43.744
UM, THANKS, UH, BUT I'M...
(clears throat)

05:43.811 --> 05:45.513
I'M NOT REALLY
A PART OF THIS GAME.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.215
YOU ARE NOW, BEEYOTCH.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.750
***

05:49.817 --> 05:54.588
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I HAVE TO HAVE A BARBECUE?

05:54.655 --> 05:57.157
NOT A BARBECUE, GEORGE--
THE BARBECUE.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.459
HERE'S THE DEALIO, GEORGE.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.193
IF YOU MOVE
INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

06:00.260 --> 06:02.530
AND DON'T HAVE "THE BARBECUE,"
YOU'LL BE SHUNNED.
OSTRACIZED.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.598
EXCOMMUNICATED.
AND WHY?

06:04.665 --> 06:06.967
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE BARBECUE.
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE BARBECUE.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.402
THIS IS CHATSWIN,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.370
AND WHEN A NEW FAMILY MOVES HERE
AND DOESN'T HAVE THE BARBECUE,

06:10.438 --> 06:12.205
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T WANT TO
BE A PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.442
AND IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT US,
WE DON'T WANT THEM.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.476
THAT'S JUST
HUMAN NATURE.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.477
SO HAVE THE BARBECUE.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.478
AND EAT YOUR CAKE.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.379
IT'S GOOD.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.516
LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU INCLUDING ME

06:22.583 --> 06:24.485
IN YOUR REINDEER GAMES,
SINCERELY,

06:24.552 --> 06:28.522
BUT, UM, IN THIS CASE, I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE TO POLITELY DECLINE.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.124
(sighs) ONCE SOMEONE
DARES YOU TO DO SOMETHING,

06:31.191 --> 06:34.495
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO DO IT,
OR ELSE YOU'RE A WUSS.

06:34.562 --> 06:38.365
YEAH, I'M--I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE RULES OF...

06:38.432 --> 06:40.233
WUSS-IOSITY,

06:40.300 --> 06:42.770
BUT THERE ARE LOOPHOLES.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.639
YOU KNOW WHAT A LOOPHOLE IS,
DON'T... YOU?

06:45.706 --> 06:48.642
SURE. IT'S A HOLE
WITH A LOOP IN IT.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.043
(Kari Kimmel)
* AND LET'S LIVE IT UP *

06:50.110 --> 06:52.980
* TURN IT OUT,
TIME IS FEELING RIGHT *

06:53.046 --> 06:54.948
* NO MORE WAITING *

06:55.015 --> 06:58.185
* OH, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT,
WE'RE GONNA GO *

06:58.251 --> 06:59.252
* OH *

06:59.319 --> 07:00.253
(bell dinging,
flippers clacking)

07:00.320 --> 07:02.189
* AND START THIS SHOW *

07:02.255 --> 07:04.958
* OH, OH, OH, OH *

07:05.893 --> 07:07.961
PICKLES, PICKLES,
PICKLES, PICKLES!

07:08.028 --> 07:08.862
(door slams)

07:08.929 --> 07:11.331
P-PICKLES GIVE HER
IRRITABLE BOWEL.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.866
IT'S A BRINE THING.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.069
ANYWAY,
THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.605
(door opens and closes)

07:17.671 --> 07:20.708
I DIDN'T SERVE PICKLES.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.577
RYAN SHAY IS A NEANDERTHAL.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.845
HOW COULD I HAVE KISSED
A PERSON WHO IS,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.179
BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
A KNUCKLE-DRAGGER...

07:26.246 --> 07:29.883
(cell phone vibrating)
AND ACTUALLY LIKE IT?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.852
(alarm chirps)

07:31.919 --> 07:32.653
(beep)

07:32.720 --> 07:34.822
BUT IT'S A NEW DAY.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.525
I WAS DETERMINED TO PRESS ON

07:37.591 --> 07:40.027
AND ACT AS THOUGH
LAST NIGHT NEVER HAPPENED.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.629
(man) * YOU RIDIN' WITH ME? *
* UH-HUH *

07:41.695 --> 07:42.930

* IS YOU DOWN FOR ME? *
* UH-HUH *

07:45.032 --> 07:46.900
* I AIN'T FUNNY, I'M COMMITTED,
DON'T BE LYIN' TO ME *

07:46.967 --> 07:48.569
* I AIN'T THE ONE TO DO

07:48.636 --> 07:49.870
* HEY, LITTLE MAMA *

07:49.937 --> 07:51.271
* YOU SHOULD LET ME BE
YOUR DADDY *

07:51.338 --> 07:52.806
* IS YOU RIDIN' WITH ME? *
* UH-HUH *

07:52.873 --> 07:54.107

07:54.174 --> 07:55.709
* IS YOU DOWN FOR ME? *

* HEY, LITTLE MAMA *

08:01.081 --> 08:02.282
* YOU SHOULD LET ME BE
YOUR DADDY *

08:02.349 --> 08:04.818
* PROBABLY IN THE STRIP CLUB *

08:04.885 --> 08:06.086
* WITH THE THICK GIRLS LOOKIN' *

08:06.153 --> 08:07.688

08:10.991 --> 08:13.527
WHY AM I WAVING?
STOP WAVING.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.028
WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG
WITH ME?

08:15.095 --> 08:18.431
I WASN'T MYSELF.
MAYBE I WAS LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.702
***

08:23.403 --> 08:24.404
YOU OKAY, TESS?

08:24.471 --> 08:26.840
WHAT? WHY?

08:26.907 --> 08:31.579
YOU'RE... POURING MILK
THAT ISN'T THERE.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.046
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.215
LAST NIGHT?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.216
WITH THE PICKLES.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.552
OH! THE PICKLES.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.354
OH. YEAH.
THAT WAS NOTHING.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.457
THE, UM, RUMPUS ROOM JUST HAD
A LOT OF WOOD PANELING.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.759
IT FELT LIKE AN ASYLUM.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.094
A WOOD-PANELED ASYLUM?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.696
YEAH.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.165
A RUSTIC, HIGH-END
WOOD-PANELED ASYLUM.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.434
LOOK IT UP.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.636
LISA!

08:55.703 --> 08:57.671
(sighs) HEY.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.306
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND MY BROTHER.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.175
NOTHING IS GOING ON.
THEN WHY WERE YOU LOOKING
AT HIM LIKE THAT

09:02.242 --> 09:04.011
THIS MORNING
WHEN HE WAS WASHING THE CAR?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.213
THIS IS PATHETIC.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.514
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.282
IT WAS SICKENING.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.552
(indistinct conversations)

09:14.087 --> 09:15.689
LISA WAS RIGHT.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.758
IT WAS SICKENING.
I WAS SICK.

09:17.825 --> 09:21.829
I WAS TERMINAL,
AND I HAD TO FIND A CURE.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.634
INTELLECTUAL, NEUROTIC,
SELF-LOATHING JEW.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.901
MUCH MORE MY TYPE.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.470
COULD HE BE
THE RYAN SHAY ANTIDOTE?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.940
HI. I'M TESSA.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.274
I'M EVAN.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.076
WANNA MAKE OUT?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.812
WHAT? I MEAN... WHAT?

09:38.879 --> 09:41.081
(thud, coins clatter)

09:47.520 --> 09:49.189
DAMN IT, EVAN!

09:49.256 --> 09:52.125
I FEEL NOTHING. NOTHING.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.661
SORRY?

09:53.727 --> 09:55.996
NOT AS SORRY AS I AM.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.132
AS YOU WERE, EVAN.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.069
(whispers) WHAT?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.270
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
THE BARBECUE YET?

10:03.336 --> 10:04.271
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:04.337 --> 10:05.538
SERIOUSLY? THAT'S FOR REAL?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.940
YEAH, THAT'S FOR REAL.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.309
I'M SURPRISED PEOPLE ARE
STILL TALKING TO YOU.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.511
I'M SURPRISED I'M STILL
TALKING TO YOU.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.646
(snip)
OW!

10:12.713 --> 10:15.615
JAVIER, YOU JUST NICKED
MY EAR.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.085
THAT'S STRIKE TWO.
JUST SEND OUT AN EVITE.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.987
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I'M
GONNA DO THIS, REALISTICALLY.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.122
ALL I'VE GOT IS THIS OLD HIBACHI
I USED IN MANHATTAN.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.158
AN OLD HI-WHATCHI?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.527
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA DO
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.898
JAVIER, COVER YOUR EARS.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.900
I'M GONNA LET YOU
BORROW MY GRILL.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.267
OH. OKAY. COOL. THANKS.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.637
"OH. OKAY. COOL. THANKS."
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:37.705 --> 10:39.106
I NEVER LET ANYBODY
BORROW MY GRILL.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.974
YOU SHOULD BE KISSING
THE GROUND I WALK ON.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.109
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU THINK IT'S BIG ENOUGH?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.911
IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
BIG ENOUGH?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.779
IS J.LO'sASS BIG ENOUGH?
(chuckles)

10:45.846 --> 10:47.314
FOR ME, IT IS.
(chuckles)

10:47.380 --> 10:49.917
(chuckles) YEAH, I THINK
IT'S BIG ENOUGH.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.385
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.688
YOU'RE JUST THE GENTLEMAN
I WANTED TO TALK TO.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.156
HEY, IS THIS ABOUT
THE BARBECUE?

10:56.223 --> 10:57.490
NO, IT'S NOT,

10:57.557 --> 11:00.728
BUT YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE IT
BEFORE THINGS GET UNPLEASANT.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.296
GEORGE, TAKE A WALK WITH ME.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.999
OKAY.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.269
ALL RIGHT, JAVIER.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.706
LET'S TRY THE HOT SHAVE
ONE MORE TIME.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.841
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.142
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW,

11:15.208 --> 11:17.344
I MEAN, CONSIDERING
THE WHOLE CONDOM SITUATION

11:17.410 --> 11:18.879
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE,

11:18.946 --> 11:21.815
ACCORDING TO DALIA,
WHO WAS THERE,

11:21.882 --> 11:25.986
TESSA WENT TO FIRST BASE
WITH RYAN SHAY LAST NIGHT,

11:26.053 --> 11:28.188
AND APPARENTLY IT WAS HOT.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.891
UH-HUH. WHAT--
WHAT'S FIRST BASE AGAIN?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.625
WELL, IT'S REGIONAL,
BUT HERE--

11:32.692 --> 11:34.294
OPEN MOUTH, SOME TONGUE.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.865
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.
TESSA CAN'T STAND RYAN SHAY.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.533
WELL, OF COURSE TESSA
CAN'T STAND RYAN SHAY,

11:40.600 --> 11:42.770
BUT HAVE YOU SEEN
HIS ROCK-HARD ABS?

11:42.836 --> 11:45.505
(laughs) I MEAN, IF YOU...

11:45.572 --> 11:47.440
IT D--YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.176
IF NEIGHBORS DON'T LOOK OUT
FOR NEIGHBORS,

11:49.242 --> 11:51.812
WE COULD END UP HAVING
LITTLE BABY NEIGHBORS.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.213
(cell phone chirps)

11:53.280 --> 11:56.750
OH! I JUST GOT AN EVITE
TO YOUR BARBECUE ON SUNDAY.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.919
O.M.G. I AM THERE.
THANK YOU.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.855
WHAT? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

12:01.922 --> 12:04.792
ALL GOOD FOR SUNDAY, BUDDY.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.361
(school bell rings)
MEATBALL SUB--

12:08.428 --> 12:10.197
TWO OF THE LEAST SEXY WORDS
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,

12:10.263 --> 12:13.433
UNLESS RYAN SHAY WAS
ON THE OTHER END OF IT.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.636
I WAS BETTER THAN THIS.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.673
I WAS TURKEY AND WHEAT,
AND I HAD TO REMEMBER THAT.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.109
TESSA.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.845
MEET ME
BEHIND THE BLEACHERS, 2:00.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.480
OKAY. (chuckles)

12:33.353 --> 12:34.888
I NEEDED GUIDANCE,

12:34.955 --> 12:38.091
SO I WENT TO THE ONLY PLACE
I COULD THINK OF.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.361
SO, TESSA, WHAT GUIDANCE
CAN I GIVE YOU TODAY?

12:41.428 --> 12:46.834
(sighs) I AM BEING CONSUMED
BY MY DESIRE FOR SOMETHING,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.602
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOOD
FOR ME.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.604
YOU'RE ADDICTED TO DRUGS.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.873
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.641
ARE YOU SURE?
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TOLD,

12:54.707 --> 12:57.044
A LOT OF PEOPLE
FROM THE INNER CITY ARE,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.545
AND I'VE SEEN "RENT."

12:58.611 --> 13:01.248
I'M FROM MANHATTAN,
AND IT'S NOT DRUGS. (scoffs)

13:01.314 --> 13:05.252
IT'S A GUY THAT
I'M INCREDIBLY ATTRACTED TO

13:05.318 --> 13:06.386
BUT DON'T LIKE.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.889
INTELLECTUALLY,
I KNOW HE'S NOT GOOD FOR ME,

13:08.956 --> 13:11.158
BUT I CAN'T STAY AWAY
FROM HIM.

13:11.224 --> 13:14.361
SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP PEOPLE HAVE

13:14.427 --> 13:15.595
WITH THEIR DRUG DEALERS.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.030
HE'S NOT A DRUG DEALER!

13:17.097 --> 13:19.432
HE'S JUST... STUPID,

13:19.499 --> 13:22.069
WHICH MEANS I MUST BE STUPID
FOR LIKING HIM.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.637
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING MORE
TO HIM THAN MEETS THE EYE.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.439
AFTER ALL,
WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT ME,

13:26.506 --> 13:29.276
ALL THEY SEE IS SOMEONE
WHO'S NORTH KOREAN,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.111
BUT WHEN THEY DIG
A LITTLE DEEPER,

13:31.178 --> 13:32.445
THEY'RE ALSO SURPRISED
TO LEARN

13:32.512 --> 13:36.183
THAT I'M PARTIALLY...
SOUTH KOREAN.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.252
RYAN WASN'T SOUTH KOREAN...

13:39.319 --> 13:42.222
***

13:42.289 --> 13:45.592
BUT HE CERTAINLY WAS
A GOOD KISSER.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.428
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE
MAKING OUT BEHIND THE BLEACHERS.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.997
IT IS SO CLICHE.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.065
WHO'S CLICHE?
IS SHE, LIKE, A SINGER?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.934
(woman)
* FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD *

13:54.001 --> 13:55.068
DON'T SPEAK.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.069
* THE FURTHER THAT YOU GO *

13:56.136 --> 13:58.338
BUT WE HAD TO SPEAK.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.007
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I WAS GOING TO FIND OUT

14:00.073 --> 14:02.042
IF THERE WAS MORE TO RYAN
THAN MET MY LIPS.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.677
* THERE'S A BOY DOWN
IN NEW YORK CITY *

14:04.744 --> 14:06.746
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A FOREIGN FILM?

14:06.813 --> 14:08.081
"AVATAR"?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.917
THAT'S NOT A FOREIGN FILM.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.219
IT TAKES PLACE
ON A FOREIGN PLANET.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.956
AND JAMES CAMERON IS CANADIAN.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.058
PARTIAL CREDIT.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.094
* BABE, I GOTTA ROLL *

14:21.161 --> 14:23.196
* TO THE NEXT SHORE *

14:23.263 --> 14:24.797
IF YOU COULD HAVE DINNER
WITH ANY FAMOUS PERSON,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.766
LIVING OR DEAD,
WHO WOULD IT BE?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.336
SCARLETT JOHANSSON.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.503
DEAD.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.839
I HAD NEVER BEEN SO DISGUSTED
WITH SOMEONE

14:32.906 --> 14:35.175
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE...

14:35.242 --> 14:36.043
(sighs)

14:36.109 --> 14:37.945
AND THAT SOMEONE WAS ME.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.986
OH, SO THAT--THAT KID
FROM ACROSS THE STREET--

14:46.053 --> 14:48.455
WHAT'S HIS--
WHAT'S HIS NAME? BRIAN?

14:48.521 --> 14:49.256
RYAN.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.525
RYAN. THAT'S IT. YEAH.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.561
NICE KID?

14:54.627 --> 14:57.064
I-I REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW.
DO YOU WANT MY CARROTS?

14:57.130 --> 15:00.300
UH, I'M GOOD.
HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE KID.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.670
(clears throat)
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL,

15:03.736 --> 15:07.740
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER TALKED
OR...

15:07.807 --> 15:08.875
ANYTHING?

15:08.942 --> 15:11.044
THIS IS YOUR FAULT,
NOT MINE. YOURS.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.412
MY FAULT?
WHAT--WHAT'S MY FAULT?

15:12.479 --> 15:14.614
YOU PULLED ME OUT
OF MY INDIGENOUS REGION

15:14.681 --> 15:15.949
AND JUST...
(blows raspberry)

15:16.016 --> 15:17.850
DROPPED ME INTO
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HABITAT!

15:17.917 --> 15:21.121
OKAY, I'LL TAKE YOUR CARROTS.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CARROTS,
GEORGE.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.323
IT'S ME.
I AM A GENTOO PENGUIN.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.960
I AM A SICK, DISEASED
GENTOO PENGUIN,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.861
AND I AM DYING HERE!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.497
(chair scrapes floor)

15:37.004 --> 15:39.806
(laughs)
OHH.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.974
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I LOVE HER.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.375
(George) WELL--
I CALL HER SALLY.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.012
YEAH, WELL, SALLY JUST BURNED
A HOLE IN MY RETINA.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.213
SHE'S A POWERFUL LADY,
GEORGE.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.547
UH-HUH.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.750
IF SHE WASN'T MADE OF STEEL,
I'D TAKE HER AS A LOVER.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.452
GREAT TURNOUT, GEORGE.
YEAH.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.187
I AM SORRY MY HUSBAND
COULDN'T BE HERE,

15:54.254 --> 15:58.325
BUT HE TRAVELS A LOT
ON BUSINESS.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.560
OKAY.
HOW--HOW'S THE GUACAMOLE?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.695
IT'S KILLER.
YOU SMUSH IT YOURSELF?

16:02.762 --> 16:03.696
I DID, ACTUALLY, YES.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.032
YOU DID?
YES.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.068
SPEAKING OF SMUSHING,
ANY INTEL ON WHAT HAPPENED

16:08.135 --> 16:10.570
BETWEEN TESSA AND RYAN
IN THE RUMPUS ROOM,

16:10.637 --> 16:13.606
OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT,
"THE HUMPUS IN THE RUMPUS"?

16:13.673 --> 16:15.108
UH, YEAH, WELL, NOT REALLY.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.776
I TRIED TO BROACH
THE SUBJECT WITH HER,

16:16.843 --> 16:18.011
BUT SHE JUST GOT UPSET

16:18.078 --> 16:20.080
AND SAID SOMETHING CRYPTIC
ABOUT PENGUINS.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.882
OOH. THAT MIGHT BE
INTERNET TALK FOR "PENIS."

16:22.949 --> 16:24.217
I'LL YAHOO! IT
AND GET BACK TO YOU.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.053
I GOTTA BE HONEST.
I'M NOT OVERLY CONCERNED.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.754
THAT KID'S
A TOTAL BONEHEAD.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.023
WELL, SO IS RYAN.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.259
I WAS TALKING ABOUT RYAN.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.426
OKAY.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.227
(clacks)

16:34.294 --> 16:35.495
(children laughing)

16:35.562 --> 16:37.297
HEY.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.198
HEY.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.766
YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.469
MAD? NO.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.437
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T HELP
THE WAY YOU FEEL...

16:44.504 --> 16:46.073
I GUESS.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.342
YEAH. (chuckles) EXACTLY.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.044
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE CHIPS.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.612
CHIPS ARE MY FAVORITE THING
IN THE WORLD.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.546
I COULD EAT, LIKE,

16:53.613 --> 16:55.082
TWO OR THREE BAGS AT ONCE.
(chuckles)

16:55.148 --> 16:56.083
(laughs) I KNOW, RIGHT?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.784
BUT I DON'T.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.252
YOU KNOW WHY?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.221
BECAUSE THEY'RE BAD FOR ME.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.191
AS MUCH AS I WANT TO PUT
THAT ENTIRE BAG INSIDE MY MOUTH,

17:04.257 --> 17:05.725
I KNOW THAT IF I DO,
I'LL GET DEHYDRATED,

17:05.792 --> 17:08.228
I'LL BREAK OUT,
AND I MIGHT GET DIARRHEA.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.629
DIARRHEA? FROM CHIPS?

17:09.696 --> 17:13.933
SO I DON'T,
BECAUSE I'VE GOT WILLPOWER,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.037
AND I CAN'T BE MAD AT YOU
FOR NOT HAVING WILLPOWER.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.006
ALL I CAN DO IS PITY YOU,

17:20.073 --> 17:21.708
WHICH I DO.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.348
OKAY. WELL, THANKS.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.117
SO WONDERFUL
TO BE HERE, GEORGE.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.351
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.320
MM.
THE HYDRANGEAS ARE
JUST... WOW.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.787
OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.856
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT'S--IT'S SO NICE TO SEE

17:36.923 --> 17:38.491
A GAY COUPLE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.394
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M BACK
IN THE CITY. (chuckles)

17:41.461 --> 17:43.463
THERE'S A GAY COUPLE?
WHERE?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.932
GOSSIP. I LOVE HEARING IT
BEFORE MY WIFE. DISH.

17:45.998 --> 17:46.933
DISH.
DISH.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.135
(Noah) GEORGE.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.969
HI. (lowered voice)
WE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

17:50.036 --> 17:54.641
SHE'S DEAD. SALLY'S DEAD.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SHE'S DEAD?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.075
SHE'S OUT OF PROPANE!

17:56.143 --> 17:57.210
OKAY, SO I'LL GO PICK UP
SOME MORE.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.612
NO MORE. NO.
SHE TAKES THE BIG TANKS.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.281
THE ONLY PLACE THAT SELLS
THE BIG TANKS IS ARTIE'S.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.383
ARTIE'S IS CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!
ARTIE!

18:03.450 --> 18:06.653
OKAY, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
GIVE ME A SECOND TO THINK.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.121
GEORGE.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.489
(clanks)
WHAT'S THE E.T.A.
ON THE BURGERS?

18:09.556 --> 18:10.690
THE NATIVES
ARE GETTING RESTLESS.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.193
MAN CANNOT LIVE
BY CHIPS AND GUAC ALONE.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.195
FRED,
LET ME WALK THIS DOG.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.463
FIVE, TEN MINUTES, TOPS.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.365
IF YOU ASK ME,
CALLING A BARBECUE A BARBECUE

18:18.431 --> 18:21.067
WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING
A BARBECUE WOULD BE WORSE

18:21.134 --> 18:22.235
THAN NOT HAVING
A BARBECUE AT ALL.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.470
DIDN'T ASK YOU.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.273
BOY, SOMEONE HAD
A BIG SCOOP OF CRAB SALAD.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.607
(chuckles)
YEAH, A BIG SCOOP.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.775
(sighs) DAMN IT, FRED.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.244
IF YOU CAN'T PLUS IT,
YOU JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.981
RYAN, I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.249
IS IT MY BREATH?

18:36.316 --> 18:37.784
BECAUSE I SKIPPED
THE GUACAMOLE.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.352
NO. YOUR BREATH IS FINE.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.487
IT'S ME.
OHH.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.054
YOU HAD THE GUACAMOLE.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.790
NO. I MEAN, A LITTLE,
YEAH, BUT--

18:43.856 --> 18:45.124
I COULD TASTE IT,

18:45.192 --> 18:46.693
BUT I WASN'T GONNA SAY
ANYTHING. (chuckles)

18:46.759 --> 18:49.629
LOOK, RYAN, I LIKE YOU.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.497
I DO.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.700
I MEAN,
YOU'RE GOOD-LOOKING,

18:53.766 --> 18:55.235
AND YOU'RE...

18:55.302 --> 18:56.736
REALLY GOOD-LOOKING.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.970
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

18:58.037 --> 18:59.572
NOTHING.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.841
IT'S JUST...

19:01.908 --> 19:03.142
YOU'RE A BAG OF CHIPS.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.044
A BAG OF CHIPS?

19:05.111 --> 19:06.379
YEAH, YOU KNOW HOW
THEY TASTE REALLY GOOD,

19:06.446 --> 19:08.114
BUT THEY'RE VOID
OF ALL NUTRITIONAL VALUE,

19:08.181 --> 19:10.617
AND IN THE END,
YOU KINDA REGRET EATING THEM?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.552
NO.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.954
OH.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.556
WELL, YOU DO.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.124
OH, YEAH?

19:18.191 --> 19:20.727
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE?

19:20.793 --> 19:21.528
YOU'RE PEANUT BRITTLE.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.162
EXCUSE ME?
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.797
YOU'RE BIG CHUNKS
OF STICKY STUFF

19:24.864 --> 19:26.799
THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER
IT'S SWEET OR SALTY,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.701
AND YOU GOTTA BREAK IT UP
INTO LITTLE PIECES.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.103
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING TO YOU.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.275
I'M BREAKING UP
INTO LITTLE PIECES!

19:38.278 --> 19:41.614
AS RYAN AND HIS SIX-PACK WALKED
OUT OF THE LAUNDRY ROOM,

19:41.681 --> 19:43.149
IT HIT ME.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.018
I WOULD NEVER SEE
THE GUN SHOW AGAIN.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.119
(clanks)

19:47.186 --> 19:48.621
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

19:48.688 --> 19:49.822
HIS NAME IS JOE.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.957
HE'S FROM NEW YORK,

19:51.023 --> 19:52.492
AND HE RUNS ON OLD-FASHIONED
CHARCOAL BRIQUETTES.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.827
NOW LET'S LIGHT HIS FACE
ON FIRE

19:54.894 --> 19:58.030
AND SERVE THESE PEOPLE
SOME NEW YORK-STYLE DOGS.

19:58.097 --> 20:02.969
THE ONLY THING MORE VORACIOUS
THAN MY APPETITE FOR RYAN

20:03.035 --> 20:06.773
WAS CHATSWIN'S APPETITE
FOR BARBECUE.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.108
(indistinct conversations)

20:09.175 --> 20:12.178
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT
GENTOO PENGUINS EAT IN THE WILD,

20:12.245 --> 20:14.447
BUT SINCE
YOU'RE IN CAPTIVITY,

20:14.514 --> 20:15.748
YOU WANT A HOT DOG?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.184
THANKS.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.719
THERE HE IS.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.054
LOVED YOUR NEW YORK WIENERS,
GEORGE.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.723
I COULD HAVE EATEN
A DOZEN OF THEM.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.057
UTTERLY DELICIOUS.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.959
WE'LL HAVE TO SNEAK
INTO A METROPOLIS SOMETIME,

20:27.026 --> 20:29.262
WHEN OUR WIVES AREN'T
LOOKING FOR A SAUSAGE FIX.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.997
OH. TOODLES, GEORGE.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.098
TOODLES.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.199
MWAH.
(chuckles)

20:33.266 --> 20:35.702
TOODLES. (chuckles)

20:35.768 --> 20:37.337
WOW.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.206
SO I GUESS OUR BARBECUE
WAS A SUCCESS.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.674
HIGH FIVE.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.543
(sighs)

20:44.811 --> 20:46.212
A YEAR AGO,
IF YOU'D HAVE TOLD ME

20:46.279 --> 20:47.614
I'D BE HIGH-FIVING
OVER A BARBECUE,

20:47.680 --> 20:49.616
I WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU
A LIAR.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.418
YEAH, WELL, IF YOU TOLD ME
I'D BE FIRST IN LINE

20:51.484 --> 20:54.287
TO SEE THE GUN SHOW,
I'D HAVE SLAPPED MYSELF.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.288
(chuckles)

20:55.355 --> 20:56.423
DON'T SLAP YOURSELF.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.758
IT WAS
A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE GUN SHOW.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.860
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

21:00.927 --> 21:01.961
HEY, I'VE BEEN THERE.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.532
I-I ONCE DATED
THIS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

21:05.598 --> 21:09.536
WHO I COULD HARDLY STAND BEING
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.773
I LOVE WHEN YOU TELL
STORIES ABOUT MOM.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.645
EAT YOUR HOT DOG.
