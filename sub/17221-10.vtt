WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:03.604
.

00:03.637 --> 00:04.205
- I CANNOT GIVE YOU NITROUS

00:05.039 --> 00:05.739
EVERY TIME YOU COME IN
FOR A CLEANING.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.376
IT KILLS BRAIN CELLS.
IT DOES.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.178
JUST LOOK AT SUE ELLEN
AT RECEPTION.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.646
- SHE LAUGHS FOR NO REASON.
SHE IS NOT OKAY.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.282
- [laughing]

00:14.315 --> 00:15.283
- [laughs]

00:15.316 --> 00:16.284
I KNOW.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.285
OKAY, SHE WAS IN MED SCHOOL,

00:17.318 --> 00:18.586
BUT FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS,

00:18.619 --> 00:20.254
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE SAME
HIGHLIGHTS MAGAZINE.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.689
- OH, MY GOSH.
HEY, WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

00:21.722 --> 00:23.824
CRANK IT UP.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.494
- UH...
GOD.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.495
I SLEPT WITH NICK.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.097
- WHAT?

00:29.130 --> 00:31.332
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
YOU SLEPT WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.402
I--JUST, WILL YOU LEAN BACK
AND OPEN YOUR MOUTH?

00:34.435 --> 00:35.569
I JUST--

00:35.603 --> 00:37.305
- BUT YOU WERE DOING SO GOOD,
MICHELLE.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.572
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:38.606 --> 00:39.573
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.674
I--I THINK I WAS IN DENIAL,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.376
AND NOW I'VE MOVED
INTO DEPRESSION.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.412
- YOU CAN'T BE DEPRESSED, OKAY?

00:44.445 --> 00:46.280
LOOK, MAYBE NICK
WAS A GOOD THING.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.715
HE DIDN'T LET YOU EAT CARBS.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.384
- I JUST THINK I NEED TO BE SAD
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

00:50.418 --> 00:51.619
I JUST NEED TO GO HOME
AND--

00:51.652 --> 00:54.422
AND SIT IN THE BATH
AND READ HARRY POTTER AND CRY...

00:54.455 --> 00:56.190
- MM.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.092
- 'CAUSE I'M JUST...

00:58.126 --> 01:00.361
I'M JUST REALLY SAD,
AND I'M LONELY.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.462
- OH, NO.
- YOU KNOW?

01:01.495 --> 01:04.732
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, MICH,

01:04.765 --> 01:07.868
OKAY, YOU--
YOU ARE SUCH A SPECIAL LADY.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.338
YEAH, YOU'RE VERY, VERY PRETTY,

01:10.371 --> 01:12.106
AND YOU'RE SEXY,

01:12.140 --> 01:14.542
AND YOU'RE INTELLIGENT,
AND YOU PAY YOUR RENT ON TIME.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.477
AND YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE BIRD

01:16.510 --> 01:18.146
THAT'S JUST BEEN FREED
FROM HER CAGE.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.079
AND YOU KEEP TRYING TO FLY HOME,

01:19.113 --> 01:20.581
BUT YOU'RE HITTING
THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR

01:20.614 --> 01:21.882
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
IT'S A WINDOW,

01:21.915 --> 01:23.317
AND YOU HIT YOUR BEAK,
YOU FALL DOWN.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.253
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TOSS YOU
OR FLUSH YOU.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.388
WHOA. WHOA.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.289
THAT NITROUS IS REALLY GOOD.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.457
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,

01:29.490 --> 01:30.758
I'M GONNA PICK YOU UP TONIGHT
AT 8:00,

01:30.791 --> 01:33.794
AND BY 10:00,
YOU ARE GONNA BE LEGS UP.

01:33.827 --> 01:34.628
BOOM.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.197
- YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A FILTHY MOUTH.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.265
- OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE A PRUDE.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.200
- NO, LIKE, LITERALLY FILTHY.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.135
HOW ARE YOU BRUSHING YOUR TEETH,
WITH YOUR FINGER?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.370
- AH.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.339
[upbeat music]

01:45.373 --> 01:53.381
*

01:55.249 --> 01:56.217
- TO SUM IT UP,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.286
YOU NEVER ACTUALLY SAW
STATE SENATOR CRANKLIN

01:58.319 --> 02:01.355
RECEIVE MONEY FROM ANY
OF THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.623
- MM-MM.
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.657
- ALL RIGHT,

02:03.691 --> 02:07.328
STATE MAY CALL ITS NEXT WITNESS.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.496
WHAT?

02:08.529 --> 02:09.830
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:09.863 --> 02:11.299
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME
TO STEAL THIRD--WHAT?

02:11.332 --> 02:13.801
- NO--WHAT?
NO, JUST GIVE ME A BREAK.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.369
[laughs]
PLEASE.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.904
CAN YOU?
A BREAK?

02:16.937 --> 02:17.905
CAN YOU GIVE ME A BREAK?

02:17.938 --> 02:18.906
- OH.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.341
WELL...

02:20.374 --> 02:22.410
NO, IT'S A--
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY...

02:22.443 --> 02:23.777
FOR LUNCH.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.247
BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S--
LET'S CALL IT BRUNCH.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.248
ONE HOUR, BRUNCH.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.516
[gavel pounds]

02:31.352 --> 02:32.520
TOM, OKAY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:32.553 --> 02:33.821
- OKAY.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.223
I JUST NEED, LIKE,
A LITTLE, TINY, BITTY RECESS

02:35.256 --> 02:36.490
FOR THE REST OF THE WHOLE DAY.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.792
- WHAT--DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH YOUR HAIR SITUATION?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.261
- NO, THIS--
WAIT, WHAT?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.128
MY--WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY--

02:41.161 --> 02:42.696
- A TOUCH OF THE BIEBS,
JUST A TOUCH.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.697
IT'S GETTING BIG.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.965
- NO.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.934
LOOK, MY KEY WITNESS
AGAINST THE STATE SENATOR,

02:46.967 --> 02:48.569
HER CHIEF OF STAFF,
IS MISSING.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.903
- OOH, WELL, FIVE COUNTS
OF CORRUPTION,

02:49.937 --> 02:51.104
YOU NEED YOUR WITNESS.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.641
- MM, GOD, I LOVE WHEN YOU
TELL ME THINGS I ALREADY KNOW.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.842
I HAVE SUBPOENAED THIS WITNESS.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.909
ALL RIGHT, I'VE CALLED HIM.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.345
I'VE TEXTED HIM, EMAILED HIM.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.612
HE IS NOT SHOWING UP ANYWHERE.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.647
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

02:59.680 --> 03:00.848
- WELL...

03:00.881 --> 03:02.483
WHEN I WAS D.A.,

03:02.516 --> 03:05.653
I DID WHATEVER IT TOOK
TO GET MY GUY.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.222
I ONCE DROVE 15 HOURS
TO BURNING MAN,

03:08.256 --> 03:09.623
BUILT A ROBOT,

03:09.657 --> 03:11.292
RODE AROUND ON A UNICYCLE--

03:11.325 --> 03:12.426
TOPLESS--

03:12.460 --> 03:13.427
TO GET MY GUY.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.628
- REALLY?
YOU HAD TO?

03:14.662 --> 03:15.929
- IT WAS BRUTAL.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.631
I GOT HELLA WINDBURN,

03:17.665 --> 03:19.733
AND MY DR. SEUSS HAT STILL
SMELLS LIKE A BONFIRE.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.369
YEAH, BUT YOU GOT TO--
YOU GOT TO DO IT, TOM.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.304
YOU GOT TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.374
YOU NEED TO STEP
OUTSIDE THE LINES.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.577
- NOPE, GOING OUTSIDE THE LINES
LEADS TO ANARCHY.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.744
FIRST YOU HAVE A COOKIE
BEFORE DINNER,

03:30.778 --> 03:31.879
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

03:31.912 --> 03:33.146
YOU'RE BURYING A HOOKER
IN THE PARK.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.616
- WELL, THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET CRANKLIN OR YOUR WITNESS.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.385
- ARE WE JUST GONNA SAIL

03:37.418 --> 03:39.420
RIGHT PAST
"BURYING A HOOKER IN THE PARK"?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.488
WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA TALK
ABOUT IT?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.290
- OKAY, THEORETICALLY,
ALL RIGHT,

03:42.323 --> 03:44.492
IF I WERE TO GO
OUTSIDE THE LINES,

03:44.525 --> 03:45.793
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.661
- LOOK,
YOU HAVE THE DUDE'S INFO,

03:47.695 --> 03:49.297
GO TO WHERE HE NORMALLY
HANGS OUT,

03:49.330 --> 03:50.298
OKAY, AND TRACK HIM DOWN.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.465
- BUT HE'S RIGHT, TOM.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.733
YOU GOT TO GET OUT THERE
AND FIND THIS GUY

03:52.766 --> 03:54.302
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.369
- TOM BY HIMSELF, MAN--

03:55.403 --> 03:56.570
TOM'S GONNA GET KILLED
OUT THERE.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.907
[both laugh]
- HE IS GONNA GET BRUTALIZED.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.275
YOU GOT TO GO WITH HIM.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.377
- DID I SAY KILLED?
I MEANT EMBRACED.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.713
OKAY, I GET THOSE WORDS MIXED UP
ALL THE TIME.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.548
SO WHICH ONE MEANS
HE'LL BE FINE?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.016
- HOT DOUGHNUT?

04:14.054 --> 04:17.024
- JUDGE HERNANDEZ,
LAVERNE WILSON.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.526
- OF COURSE.
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.362
I MISSED YOU WHEN I DID
THE HARASSMENT SEMINAR

04:21.395 --> 04:22.996
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE
LAST MONTH.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.698
- I HAD THE FLU.
- OH.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.934
- YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS LITTLE MAKEUP SEMINAR

04:26.967 --> 04:28.369
JUST FOR ME.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.770
I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF THESE
OVER THE YEARS,

04:29.803 --> 04:32.706
AND I THINK I KNOW
RIGHT FROM WRONG BY NOW.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.508
- OH, BUT THE RULES
ARE ALWAYS CHANGING.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.843
FOR EXAMPLE,

04:35.876 --> 04:38.512
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE JENKINS VS. HERSHFELD CASE?

04:38.546 --> 04:43.016
- I WAS THE PRESIDING JUDGE
IN THE CASE, SO YES.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.585
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SIGN
THAT LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER

04:44.618 --> 04:45.886
THAT SAYS I COMPLETED
THE SEMINAR,

04:45.919 --> 04:46.887
AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY?

04:46.920 --> 04:48.989
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.659
HAVE A SEAT.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.362
- FOUR HOURS OF DISCUSSING
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR

04:54.395 --> 04:55.463
IN THE WORKPLACE WITH YOU--

04:55.496 --> 04:59.032
NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY MAKE THIS
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.335
- HELLO, LAVERNE!

05:01.369 --> 05:03.371
- WELCOME, JUDY.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.506
- I STAND CORRECTED.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.507
HELLO, JUDY.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.641
- HI, SIR.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.015
- ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE ALLOWED
ONE BACKSLIDE WITH YOUR EX.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.016
AND ANYTHING AFTER THAT,

05:16.049 --> 05:17.084
YOU'RE BASICALLY BACK TOGETHER.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.752
AND I AM WILLING TO HELP YOU,

05:18.786 --> 05:20.354
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COMMIT.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.389
- YOU KNOW, I'M IN.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.424
I AM, BUT I--
I'M NERVOUS.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.426
I WAS MARRIED FOR 17 YEARS.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.427
- UGH.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.961
- IT'S BEEN, LIKE, 16 1/2 YEARS

05:27.995 --> 05:29.830
SINCE A MAN HAS TAKEN OFF
MY BRA.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.131
- OKAY, DON'T EVER
TELL ANYONE THAT

05:31.164 --> 05:32.132
OTHER THAN ME.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.001
- OKAY.
- HEY.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.369
YOU ARE NEW HERE.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.136
RIGHT?
- YES.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.571
I'M DEREK.
IT'S MY FIRST WEEK.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.573
- HELLO, I AM REBECCA.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.008
I'VE SEEN YOU AROUND
A COUPLE TIMES.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.044
- YEAH.
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU BEFORE.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.145
I WOULD REMEMBER.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.146
- I'M MICHELLE.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.715
- OH, MICHELLE.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.050
- [giggles]
- DUDE, YOUR HANDS ARE SO SOFT.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.486
- OH, THAT--THAT'S--
THEY GET SWEATY,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.487
'CAUSE THEY'RE IN LATEX GLOVES

05:53.521 --> 05:54.755
ALL DAY.
[sniffs]

05:54.788 --> 05:56.757
- WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S--IT'S WORKING.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.693
NICE TO MEET YOU, MICHELLE.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.961
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
NEVER SMELL YOUR HANDS

06:00.994 --> 06:02.396
IN PUBLIC
AND SPEAK OF LATEX.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.597
NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.467
SECONDLY, THAT GUY IS ADORABLE,
AND HE'S TOTALLY INTO YOU.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.768
- WELL, HE CALLED ME "DUDE."

06:07.801 --> 06:09.002
- YEAH, IT'S
'CAUSE HE LIKES YOU.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.103
THAT'S WHAT
THE YOUNG PEOPLE SAY.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.072
YEAH, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,

06:12.105 --> 06:13.807
YOUNG GUYS LOVE WOMEN OUR AGE.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.444
OLD GUYS LOVE WOMEN OUR AGE.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.712
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT
DON'T LIKE 40-YEAR-OLD WOMEN

06:18.746 --> 06:19.980
ARE 40-YEAR-OLD MEN.

06:20.013 --> 06:20.981
- OH.
- YEAH.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.182
- OKAY.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.684
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO THIS.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.553
- YEAH, YOU CAN.
YOU GOT IT.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.521
- HERE YOU GO.
THESE ARE ON ME.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.789
- OH, CHEERS.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.424
- THANK YOU, DUDE.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.792
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.428
UM, SO YOU GUYS ALL GOOD?

06:34.462 --> 06:36.997
- AS AN EXPERIENCED OLDER WOMAN,

06:37.030 --> 06:39.800
I CAN TELL YOU, YES, DUDE.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.801
- OKAY.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.837
- BUT THIS IS FOR YOU

06:43.871 --> 06:45.172
FROM MICHELLE.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.173
- THANK YOU.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.775
- YEAH.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.510
WAIT, HE'S NOT GONNA KNOW
I'M INTERESTED

06:49.543 --> 06:51.078
JUST BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT TIP'S
FROM ME.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.047
- HE WILL IF YOUR PHONE NUMBER
IS WRITTEN ON THE BACK.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.082
both: WHAT?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.517
- I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU DO THAT.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.851
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

07:03.156 --> 07:03.290
.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.224
- YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.060

07:07.094 --> 07:08.061
OH, GOD.

INTO MY POCKET.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.084
- WHERE'S THE CLERK?
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.820
WE GOT TO AT LEAST SIGN
THIS STUFF OUT.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.955
- I KEEP IT ALL UP HERE, TOM.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.056
- HOW DO I LOOK IN THIS?

07:36.089 --> 07:40.093
- UH, PROBABLY BETTER
THAN THE GUY WHO DIED IN IT.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.929
- GHOST JACKET.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.130
IS THAT SOMETHING?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.131
I THINK IT'S A THING.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.633
- I'VE NOT HEARD OF THAT.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.104
- HEY.

07:51.138 --> 07:55.042
- HEY, MORNING, SLEEPYHEAD.
HOW'D IT GO WITH DEREK?

07:55.075 --> 07:56.777
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.111
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.213
- OH, MY GOD. RELAX.
NO.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.183
WE JUST WENT AFTER WORK
TO THIS PLACE AND GOT A BEER.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.652
- MM-HMM.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.054
I JUST--IT JUST FEEL SO WEIRD
TO BE DATING.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.055
[cell phone buzzes]

THAT'S HIM, RIGHT?

08:09.256 --> 08:10.624

HE WON'T STOP TEXTING ME.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.059
DID YOU REALIZE HE'S 24?

08:12.092 --> 08:13.927
ALL RIGHT,
AFTER HE KISSED ME GOOD NIGHT,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.764
HE, LIKE, GAVE ME A HIGH FIVE
AND TOOK OFF ON HIS BICYCLE.

08:16.797 --> 08:21.869
- "DUDE, BARBECUE AT MY PLACE
TODAY, POOL, BEER PONG.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.070

08:23.103 --> 08:25.105
DUDE, ARE YOU DOWN?
- DUDE, I HAVE TO WORK.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.075
- COME ON, 24--
24 IS THE GOLDEN AGE, MAN.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.777
THEY'RE RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE,

08:29.810 --> 08:31.679
BUT THEY HAVEN'T HAD
THEIR SPIRITS CRUSHED YET.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.780
RIGHT?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.748
- GOSH, I AM REALLY GOOD
AT BEER PONG.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.049
- YOU'RE GONNA BAIL OUT OF WORK
EARLY,

08:36.083 --> 08:36.917
AND I WILL PICK YOU UP.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.251

08:56.103 --> 08:57.304
THAT MAKES ME FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.706
- GREAT.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.174
NOW, LET'S DO
A LITTLE ROLE PLAYING.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.897
"CAN I GIVE YOU A BACK RUB?"
- UH-UH! NO!

09:23.931 --> 09:24.965

09:37.377 --> 09:40.013
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.015
- DID THIS USED TO BE
A BEST WESTERN?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.016
- MAYBE.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.185
I THINK THEY BUILT IT
AROUND THE PALM TREES.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.253
- MICHELLE, HI.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.757
I--I RECENTLY, YOU KNOW,
GOT OUT OF A MARRIAGE

10:23.791 --> 10:26.159
WITH A MAN I DEVOTED
MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE TO.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.095
GOD, AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST OUT IN THE WORLD.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.997
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.131
AND I THINK
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

10:31.164 --> 10:32.265
THAT I COULD DIE ALONE,

10:32.299 --> 10:35.936
SO WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME SPINACH DIP?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.304
- YES.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.006

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.307

10:40.340 --> 10:42.075
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE SEXY SMALL TALK.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.376
WHAT DO I TALK TO THEM ABOUT?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.245
VIDEO GAMES?
USHER?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.179
- DON'T WORRY

10:46.213 --> 10:47.881
ALL YOU GOT TO DO--
YOU GOT TO ZIP THAT.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.049
YOU GOT TO UNZIP THIS.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.150
BOOM, OKAY?
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.185

11:38.866 --> 11:40.300
YEAH, YOU GUYS,
I'VE BEEN PLAYING BEER PONG

11:40.333 --> 11:41.735
SINCE YOU WERE, LIKE, FOUR.

11:41.769 --> 11:42.836
OKAY? YEAH.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.071
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT A KEG STAND IS.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.205
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST GO.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.174
- YOU'RE KIND OF BEING, LIKE,
MICHELLE HARVEY OSWALD

11:47.207 --> 11:48.375
FUN ASSASSIN RIGHT NOW.

AND THEN WE CAN GO, OKAY?

11:51.011 --> 11:53.113
JUST ONE MORE GAME.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.848
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M STARVING.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.316
OKAY, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BARBECUE.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.918
- THERE'S NO ACTUAL BARBECUE.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.452
THAT'S JUST OUR TERM
FOR A, YOU KNOW, DAYTIME PARTY.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.921
- BOOM.

12:00.954 --> 12:01.922
- BUT YOU DO HAVE A GRILL,

12:01.955 --> 12:03.190
SO MAYBE WE COULD FIRE IT UP.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.858
- UM, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,

12:04.892 --> 12:07.094
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP
OUR FLIP-FLOPS.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.428
- AWESOME!

12:11.464 --> 12:11.865

12:15.936 --> 12:17.537
- WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.939
- STAKEOUT GEAR, BABY.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.407
I GOT MY STAKEOUT MIX GOING.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.909
WE GOT STAKEOUT SNACKS.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.877
ALL RIGHT?
STAKEOUT DRINKS.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.512
ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO DRINK TOO MUCH.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.914
YOU MIGHT MISS YOUR MAN
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO GO PEE

12:26.947 --> 12:28.381
EVERY TEN MINUTES, OKAY?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.550
BUT IN CASE YOU DO...

12:30.583 --> 12:33.020
STAKEOUT BATHROOM.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.321
- ALL RIGHT,
SO HOW DOES IT GO DOWN

12:34.354 --> 12:35.288
WHEN WE SEE OUR GUY?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.157
DO WE JUST, LIKE, CALL HIM OVER
TO THE CAR?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.292
- NO, I'M GONNA FLASH MY BADGE,

12:39.326 --> 12:41.862
FLASH MY SCOWL--
YOU KNOW, JUST...

12:41.895 --> 12:44.031
RIGHT, AND I'MA STRONGLY URGE
HIM TO GET IN THE BACKSEAT.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.398
- OKAY.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.835
- LOOK, I SIGNED THIS CAR OUT
SPECIALLY FOR THIS.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.102
OKAY, LOOK,

12:49.136 --> 12:51.338
THERE ARE NO HANDLES
IN THE BACKSEAT, OKAY?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.006
ONCE HE GETS IN,
HE CAN'T GET OUT.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.241
- THAT'S KIDNAPPING.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.809
THAT'S--MINIMUM SENTENCE,
TEN YEARS.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.044
- WE LET HIM KNOW UP FRONT,

12:57.077 --> 12:58.846
"HEY, MAN, YOU CAN LEAVE
WHENEVER YOU WANT TO."

12:58.879 --> 13:00.848
BUT, OOPS,
THE DOORS DON'T OPEN.

13:00.881 --> 13:04.384
[both laughing]

13:04.417 --> 13:05.452
- MICHELLE!

13:05.485 --> 13:06.820
YOU GOT TO MAKE THIS,

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
OR IT'S KEG STAND TIME.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.190

13:10.223 --> 13:11.859

13:11.892 --> 13:13.493
YOU GOT IT.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, STOP.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.527

13:17.965 --> 13:19.532
THAT WAS--

13:19.566 --> 13:21.869
- NO, NO.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.036
NO, LISTEN.
I'M READY TO GO HOME.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.504
YOU SAID ONE GAME.
WE PLAYED, LIKE, 20.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.539
- I FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T
EVEN TRY RIGHT THERE.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.275
WE CAN'T GO HOME.
WE GOT TO DO THE KEG STAND.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.342
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT BEING

13:29.376 --> 13:30.911
A VERY SUPPORTIVE FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.512
- WHAT?
- HEY, YOU READY?

13:32.545 --> 13:34.381
- YES.
WE ARE READY.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.216
LET'S GO.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.618
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.619
GO!

13:39.652 --> 13:42.489
YEAH!

13:42.522 --> 13:43.924
- I'M GOING HOME.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.059
AND YOUR RIGHT BOOB
IS ABOUT TO POP OUT.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.596
- MICHELLE.
MICHELLE!

13:49.629 --> 13:50.964
- PLEASE?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.133
- FOR THE LAST TIME,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.267
LOOK, IT'S STILL DAYLIGHT.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.602
- NO, I THINK
IT'S GETTING DARKER.

13:55.635 --> 13:59.106
- FINE.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.440
- WHOO, COOL.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.975
HEY, HEY, HEY.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.543
THAT'S OUR GUY.
THESE THINGS REALLY WORK.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.079
- LOOK--REALLY?
I CAN--I CAN SEE HIM TOO.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.547
- YOU CAN?
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE DO?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.516
- WE GO GET OUR GUY

14:09.549 --> 14:12.219
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.121
- OW!
OKAY, THAT'S BRIGHT.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.923
YEP.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.524
- UH, MR. PANZ,
WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU

14:17.557 --> 14:18.525
FOR A MINUTE.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.559
- AM I UNDER ARREST?

14:19.592 --> 14:22.162
- UH, NO.
- RIGHT, OKAY.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.630
GOOD-BYE.
- [stammers]

14:23.663 --> 14:25.532
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME
TO OUR CAR

14:25.565 --> 14:27.935
AND JUST SIT IN THE BACKSEAT,
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.036
- YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE
THERE'S ANY HARD WAY

14:29.069 --> 14:30.037
TO GET OUT OF THE CAR.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.204
- WH--

14:31.238 --> 14:33.640
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT ME
TO TESTIFY AGAINST MY BOSS.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.575
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT, OKAY?

14:35.608 --> 14:39.579
MY CAREER WOULD BE OVER.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.181
- YOUR CAREER?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.117
IF YOU DON'T TESTIFY, YOUR LIFE
WILL BE OVER, YOU MORON.

14:44.151 --> 14:47.220
YOUR BOSS IS FACING FIVE FELONY
COUNTS OF CORRUPTION.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.255
AND IF YOU DON'T TESTIFY,

14:48.288 --> 14:49.923
THAT MAKES YOU AN ACCOMPLICE,

14:49.957 --> 14:53.260
WHICH MEANS YOU AUTOMATICALLY
GET HALF OF HER SENTENCE.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.062
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
TRIPLES THAT.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.063
- RIGHT.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.130
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?
WHAT, 30?

14:57.164 --> 14:58.331
- 32.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.000
- YEAH, WELL, QUICK MATH QUIZ,
HOTSHOT.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.534
IF YOU DON'T TESTIFY,

15:01.568 --> 15:05.038
YOU ARE GOING AWAY UNTIL JUST
BEFORE YOUR 157TH BIRTHDAY.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.306
- YEP.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.608
BUT DON'T WORRY.
YOUR CAREER WILL STILL BE FINE.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.177
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:13.546 --> 15:14.647
- YOU TELL ME.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.715
- OKAY.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.717
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL DO IT.
I'LL DO IT. I'LL TESTIFY.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.152
- THERE'S SOME SNACKS BACK THERE
FOR YOU.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.720
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.990
HOLY CRAP, MAN.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.691
I MEAN, THE WAY YOU JUST HAD
ALL THAT LEGAL STUFF

15:24.724 --> 15:26.059
JUST READY TO GO--

15:26.093 --> 15:27.160
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE, TOM.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.661
- IT WAS ALL LIES.
ALL OF IT.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.130
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE MATH
WAS RIGHT.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.631
- [laughs]

15:31.664 --> 15:33.133
- I MEAN, IF HE DOESN'T TESTIFY,
IT'S, LIKE, THREE MONTHS.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.701
- SO YOU JUST, LIKE--
YOU JUST MADE ALL THAT UP.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.570
- JUST MADE IT UP!
GOD, I LOVED IT TOO.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.606
OH, IT REMINDED ME
OF WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

15:39.639 --> 15:41.308
AND I WOULD GO TO CHURCH
AND CLOSE MY EYES

15:41.341 --> 15:42.375
BUT NOT PRAY.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.510
[laughs]

15:43.543 --> 15:45.345
GOD, I JUST WANT
TO BREAK ALL THE RULES.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.613
- HEY, THIS--
OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.215
JUST START WITH JAYWALKING.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.416
- YES, ON IT,

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
AND I'M NOT GONNA WEAR
MY SEAT BELT.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.485
- HEY.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.987
- I'M GONNA WEAR MY SEAT BELT
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE RECKLESS.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.489
- OKAY.
SEAT BELTS ARE IMPORTANT.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.291
[cell phone buzzing]

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
WELL, WE GOT TO MAKE
A QUICK STOP FIRST.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.330
- YEAH, I GOT TO TINKLE.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.731
- GUYS, THANKS
FOR PICKING ME UP.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.733
I HAVE A SUPER LOW RATING
ON UBER.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.701
I'M SORRY.
I GET CARSICK.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.737
- EVERYONE GETS CARSICK
AFTER A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.306
- OH, ARE YOU THE WITNESS?
IS THIS THE WITNESS?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.275
- YES, THIS IS THE WITNESS,
AND HE'S AGREED TO TESTIFY.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.178
- OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU FINALLY GOT THAT TURD.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.280
SIR, THAT WAS UNFAIR.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.749
YOU'RE PERFORMING A VALUABLE
CIVIC DUTY BY TESTIFYING.

16:22.782 --> 16:23.783
- SO WHAT HAPPENED TO MICHELLE?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.652
- SHE TOTALLY BAILED ON ME.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.587
I GAVE HER
THE PERFECT GET-OVER-NICK PILL,

16:27.620 --> 16:28.588
AND SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT.

16:28.621 --> 16:29.722
- WHAT'D YOU TELL HER?

16:29.756 --> 16:32.125
- I TOLD HER TO QUIT WALLOWING,
GET BACK ON THE HORSE.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.793
AND THAT HORSE IS CALLED DEREK,
AND HE'S YOUNG.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.328
[growls]

16:35.362 --> 16:37.097
- YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE JUST
DON'T WANT TO BE HAPPY.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.332
- SEE?
SIR, YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.700
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

16:40.733 --> 16:44.437
I LOST THE BATTLE, GUYS,
BUT I WILL WIN THE WAR, MAN.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.406
SHE ALREADY HAD ONE BACKSLIDE
WITH HER EX.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.740
- ONE BACKSLIDE,
YOU'RE FINE,

16:47.774 --> 16:50.110
BUT THE SECOND ONE,
YOU'RE BASICALLY BACK TOGETHER.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.411
- SEE?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.346
LISTEN, MAN,
I'M GLAD THAT YOU SHOWED UP,

16:53.380 --> 16:54.647
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO FREAK YOU OUT,

16:54.681 --> 16:57.484
BUT I COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU
THREE MONTHS JAIL TIME.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.551
- WHAT?

16:58.585 --> 17:01.621
- LOOK, NO, THAT'S IN ADDITION
TO THE 150 YEARS.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.590
REMEMBER?
- WHY AREN'T WE DRIVING?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.792
- WELL, 'CAUSE SOMEONE HASN'T
PUT ON THEIR SEAT BELT YET,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.460
AND I'M LOOKING AT HER.

17:21.441 --> 17:21.574
.

17:21.608 --> 17:21.874
- [crying]

17:23.276 --> 17:24.244
- MICHELLE?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.378
- [crying]

17:25.412 --> 17:27.514
- HEY!

17:27.547 --> 17:31.251
AW, SPECIAL LADY.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.686
- SORRY, I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ME THIS WAY.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.557
- I HAVE SEEN YOU CRY
LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF TIMES

17:37.590 --> 17:42.162
ON LAND AND ON SEA,
DAY AND NIGHT,

17:42.195 --> 17:43.496
EVERY STATE IN THE UNION,

17:43.530 --> 17:44.664
AND IN GUAM.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.733
- THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE SPRING BREAK IDEA.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.568
- I KNOW,
THOSE SAILORS WERE MEAN.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.337
- WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PARTY?

17:50.370 --> 17:53.373
- WELL, IT WAS COOL
UNTIL TYLER'S MOM SHOWED UP.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.374
THEN IT GOT WEIRD.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.508
SO, YOU KNOW,

17:55.542 --> 17:57.310
I TOLD THEM ALL
THEY COULD COME HERE.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.311
WHAT?

17:58.345 --> 17:59.546
- OH, BABE, I JUST CAN'T.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.148
I CAN'T PARTY, OKAY?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.350
I'M SORRY,
I KNOW YOU THINK I'M A DRAG

18:03.383 --> 18:04.651
AND THAT I NEED TO BUST LOOSE,

18:04.684 --> 18:06.353
BUT IT'S JUST NOT WORKING
FOR ME.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.155
- MICHELLE,

18:08.188 --> 18:10.357
I JUST WISH YOU WOULD LISTEN
TO ME, OKAY?

18:10.390 --> 18:12.392
I FIX PROBLEMS, RIGHT?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.893
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF WHAT I DO,
RIGHT?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.663
I DEAL WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES
EVERY DAY,

18:16.696 --> 18:20.467
AND YOU--YOU DEAL
WITH PEOPLE'S MOUTHS,

18:20.500 --> 18:21.734
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.737
IT IS--BUT MY ADVICE
IS KIND OF SANCTIONED

18:24.771 --> 18:26.473
BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.908
THAT'S A REALLY BIG STATE.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.210
- ARE YOU STILL DRUNK?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.578
- YEAH.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.647
- LOOK, YOU'RE GREAT
AT FIXING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS,

18:34.681 --> 18:37.850
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GONNA FIX
YOU IS NOT WHAT'S GONNA FIX ME.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.386
I'M NOT YOU.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.621
- I KNOW.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.622
YOU'RE VERY TINY.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.823
- I'M TINY.

18:43.856 --> 18:47.394
- I COULD WEAR YOU
AS MY EARRINGS.

18:47.427 --> 18:51.398
MICH, WHATEVER YOU NEED, OKAY,

18:51.431 --> 18:52.265
GOT IT.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.167
- OKAY.
THANKS.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.168
[doorbell rings]

18:55.202 --> 18:57.270
- [scoffs]
THAT'S THEM.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.206
THE MERRY BAND OF MISFITS--
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.174
I'M GONNA GET RID OF THEM,
ALL RIGHT?

19:01.208 --> 19:03.576
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF HOT GUYS
AND A COUPLE OF DUMPY CHICKS,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.378
BUT [clicks tongue]
IT'S DONE.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.314
- WELL, WHAT--
IS DEREK WITH THEM?

19:07.347 --> 19:08.881
- I THINK HE IS.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.484
HE DID MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT
HIS FORMAL BASKETBALL SHORTS.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.552
SO...
- WELL...

19:12.585 --> 19:14.921
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.290
[giggles]

19:17.324 --> 19:18.525
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:18.558 --> 19:19.726
MAYBE WE CAN GET DEREK
TO READ YOU SOME HARRY POTTER.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.396
- OOH, MAYBE I'LL ALLOW HIM
INTO MY CHAMBER OF SECRETS.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.597
- NO, DON'T SAY THAT, THOUGH.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.832
- NO?
- NO.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.268
- SIR!

19:28.301 --> 19:29.402
- YES, JUDY?

19:29.436 --> 19:30.337
- WELL, I WAS WONDERING--

19:30.370 --> 19:31.838
MY NIECE IS SELLING
GIRL SCOUT COOKIES,

19:31.871 --> 19:33.206
AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY SOME?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.374
THEY'RE $4 A BOX.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.275
- SURE, PUT ME DOWN FOR TEN.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.310
- TEN BOXES TOTAL
OR TEN OF EACH KIND?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.378
- YES.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.313
- JUDGE H, WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:40.347 --> 19:41.348
EVER SINCE WE TOOK THAT SEMINAR,

19:41.381 --> 19:43.283
YOU WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.417
- WELL, IT'S JUST,
EVER SINCE THEN,

19:44.451 --> 19:46.386
I'M VERY AWARE
OF OUR INTERACTIONS,

19:46.419 --> 19:47.887
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY
OR DO ANYTHING

19:47.920 --> 19:49.956
THAT--THAT MIGHT
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.224
- PLEASE.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.959
WE WERE READING SCRIPTS.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.327
I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOU.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.795
YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN, SIR.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.365
I KNOW YOU WOULD NEVER MAKE
ANY UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES

19:58.398 --> 19:59.366
TOWARDS ME.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.633
- OF COURSE I WOULDN'T.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.436
- BECAUSE ANY SEX TALK
YOU THROW MY WAY

20:03.470 --> 20:05.305
IS MORE THAN WANTED.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.607
IT'S A-OKAY.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.276
- NO.
STOP.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.643
THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.885
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU WERE REQUIRED
TO RETAKE THAT CLASS.

20:23.856 --> 20:28.461
- I HATE TO SEE YOU GO,
BUT I LOVE TO WATCH YOU LEAVE.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.496
MM.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.464
MM, MM, OOH.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.300
- ANNE CRANKLIN,

20:33.333 --> 20:36.903
THE JURY FINDS YOU GUILTY ON
ALL FIVE COUNTS OF CORRUPTION.

20:36.936 --> 20:40.473
SENTENCING WILL BE HANDED DOWN
A WEEK FROM TODAY.

20:40.507 --> 20:44.477
YOU WILL BE REMANDED
INTO CUSTODY UNTIL THEN.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.479
- OH, THIS MAKES ME HAPPY.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.914
- I GOT TO SAY,

20:47.947 --> 20:49.982
TOM, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.719
AND I AM SORRY
THAT I HAD MY DOUBTS.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,

20:54.787 --> 20:55.855
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.657
I SHOULD BE THE ONE THANKING YOU

20:57.690 --> 21:00.460
FOR FINALLY PUSHING ME
OUTSIDE OF THE LINES.

21:00.493 --> 21:03.830
- SO YOU LIKED BEING BAD, HUH?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.466
- OR DID BEING BAD...

21:06.499 --> 21:08.401
LIKE ME?

21:09.369 --> 21:10.770
- OH.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.306
TOM.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.907
- YEAH?
