00:02.000 --> 00:03.880
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

00:03.880 --> 00:05.680
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

00:07.320 --> 00:09.440
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.960
# Sarah and Duck. #
Quack!

00:15.560 --> 00:17.320
It's a rainy afternoon,

00:17.320 --> 00:20.760
and Sarah and Duck are in the garden
talking to Rainbow.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.280
And the weather! It's just
been all over the place lately.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.920
One minute it's raining,
then it stops.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.080
I never know
where I'm going to find myself.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.240
Mm. Quack!

00:32.240 --> 00:36.160
Suddenly, I'm outside
Scooter Boy's house.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.480
Quack!

00:37.480 --> 00:42.040
SARAH GIGGLES
And there he is, worrying away about
this box car race he's entered.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.400
Box car?

00:44.400 --> 00:48.440
It's a car you make yourself
and then race downhill.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.480
That's right.
He'd run to a few problems.

00:51.480 --> 00:57.120
His box car wouldn't go because its
wheels were too... What did he say?

00:57.120 --> 00:58.520
Lumpy.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.240
Lum-py?

01:01.240 --> 01:02.280
Yes.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.680
I was about to offer him some help,

01:04.680 --> 01:07.280
then the sun went in
and I had to go.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.640
Oh. But...

01:09.640 --> 01:13.400
then I found myself
in Scarf Lady's garden. Oh!

01:13.400 --> 01:16.960
Thought I'd better ask her to help
Scooter Boy fix his car,

01:16.960 --> 01:19.240
what with her being the sporty type.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.680
Then what happened?

01:22.680 --> 01:26.600
So, I... Oh! Here I go again!

01:26.600 --> 01:29.280
Huh? Goodbye! Wait!

01:29.280 --> 01:31.600
How does the story end?

01:31.600 --> 01:33.480
SHE SIGHS

01:33.480 --> 01:35.240
We'd best get indoors.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.400
Uh-huh.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.880
Still thinking about Rainbow, I see.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.520
Yup.
Want to know how the story ends.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.880
Yeah, me too.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.200
Quack, quack!

01:50.200 --> 01:52.240
Duck!

01:52.240 --> 01:54.080
SHE GASPS
I know!

01:56.920 --> 01:58.680
What are you up to, Sarah?

01:58.680 --> 02:03.520
If I were Rainbow,
I'd know the end of the story. Oh?

02:03.520 --> 02:08.120
IMITATING RAINBOW: Ho-ho-ho. Want to
know what happens next, Duck? Quack!

02:08.120 --> 02:09.960
Oh, I see.

02:09.960 --> 02:15.040
Not a bad Rainbow impression. Hmm...
Not big enough.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.080
No?

02:17.960 --> 02:19.280
Quack, quack.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.400
Hello, Duck! QUACK!

02:25.400 --> 02:28.760
Ah, that's more like it. Uh-huh.

02:28.760 --> 02:33.480
Quack, quack. You want to be
Rainbow, too, Duck? QUACK!

02:33.480 --> 02:35.120
Oh! What are we doing?

02:37.920 --> 02:39.480
Hello, Shallots.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.920
SHALLOTS: Rainbow! Rainbow! Rainbow!

02:41.920 --> 02:45.040
Hey! That's not him. Er...

02:47.480 --> 02:48.520
Quack! Ahh!

02:48.520 --> 02:50.360
So, Rainbow...

02:50.360 --> 02:54.280
what were you saying about
Scarf Lady and Scooter Boy's wheels?

02:54.280 --> 02:57.640
Hmm... Scooter Boy's
wheels were lumpy,

02:57.640 --> 03:01.560
but Scarf Lady was too busy
washing Bag.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.720
And eating pastry!

03:03.720 --> 03:05.640
Yes.
WHISPER: No.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.840
Huh?

03:06.840 --> 03:10.600
WHISPERING: Scarf Lady made him
some wheels. They went flat.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.880
It happened outside our house. He
went to the bike shop to fix them.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.920
Oh, yes. To the bike shop. Quack!

03:17.920 --> 03:19.240
Ooh!

03:20.800 --> 03:23.960
Er...
Do you want to be Rainbow, too?

03:23.960 --> 03:26.280
BOTH WHISPERING: Yes, please.

03:32.640 --> 03:37.600
So, Pump pumped up Scooter Boy's
wheelie wheels.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.120
But...he didn't know how to drive.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.040
Oh!

03:43.040 --> 03:47.680
Yes. Then I bumped into Plate Girl,
who told me the next bit.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.880
Ah. OK.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.320
I saw Scooter Boy at the Big Shop,
asking Moon's advice.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.640
Seems we should go talk to Moon.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.040
Perhaps he'll know
what happens next. Yes.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.800
Can I be Rainbow? Erm...

04:02.800 --> 04:07.000
I don't have any more boxes.
It's OK. I can share.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.840
Hello, Duck. Quack!

04:15.360 --> 04:17.080
Quack, quack, quack.

04:17.080 --> 04:20.040
Hey! This box is heavy.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.360
To the Big Shop!

04:29.600 --> 04:34.120
Quack, quack, quack, quack!

04:38.680 --> 04:40.640
Quack! Ooh.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.000
Hello, Duck. Quack.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.920
Ooh! Hello, uh...Rainbow?

04:46.920 --> 04:50.000
Spot on. Hello, Moon.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.440
Did you teach Scooter Boy to drive?

04:52.440 --> 04:53.720
That's right.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.800
He got so good, in fact,

04:55.800 --> 04:59.360
he drove straight to the park
for that box car race.

04:59.360 --> 05:05.200
So, I thought I'd come buy some
earrings for Venus - erm, myself.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.480
Quick! To the park! Reverse!

05:08.480 --> 05:11.120
Thanks, Moon. Er, bye-bye.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.160
This foot, that foot,
this foot, that foot...

05:14.160 --> 05:17.680
IMITATING VENUS: Ooh! Thank you,
Moon, I love them!

05:20.720 --> 05:24.600
Oh! It's both sunny and raining.
Uh-oh!

05:24.600 --> 05:28.640
Maybe there's a chance we'll see...
Rainbow! Er, yes.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.880
Er, hello, Rainbow. Scarf Lady.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.680
Wotcha, Rainbow.
It's Sarah in a box!

05:37.680 --> 05:41.560
Oh, fascinating! What are you up to?

05:41.560 --> 05:45.120
We've been trying to find out
the end of your story.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.960
Oh, yes,
I hadn't quite finished, had I?

05:47.960 --> 05:49.040
Well, I...

05:49.040 --> 05:52.720
Hey up, the race is
starting! Oh, it's finishing!

05:58.800 --> 06:00.440
Where's Scooter Boy?

06:10.720 --> 06:14.600
Hello, Scooter Boy.
Oh, hello, Sarah.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.120
You're not going fast
enough for a race.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.240
Oh, no, I'm not racing.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.840
I'm driving very safely. Oh!

06:25.400 --> 06:26.520
OK...

06:26.520 --> 06:30.480
Looks like you've raced Scooter Boy
to the end of his own story!

06:30.480 --> 06:33.080
Run! Quack, quack!

06:33.080 --> 06:34.640
Nope, not yet.

06:36.400 --> 06:40.480
Whoo! Well done. Yay! Bravo!

06:40.480 --> 06:42.480
Bravo!

06:42.480 --> 06:43.680
Yes!

06:45.400 --> 06:47.120
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

06:48.880 --> 06:50.600
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

06:52.480 --> 06:54.560
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

06:56.280 --> 06:58.160
# Sarah and Duck. #
Quack!
