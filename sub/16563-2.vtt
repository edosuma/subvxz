MATT VASGERSIAN: <i>The San Diego Padres</i>

00:03.582 --> 00:06.149
<i>have called up Ginny
Baker to start today.</i>

00:06.150 --> 00:07.294
- Ginny, hi.
- Hi.

00:07.346 --> 00:08.712
Oscar Arguella, Padres' GM.

00:08.714 --> 00:10.514
Your teammates are excited to meet you.

00:10.549 --> 00:12.769
GINNY: <i>75% think I'm the
next San Diego Chicken.</i>

00:12.770 --> 00:14.551
<i>The other 25 just want to see me shower.</i>

00:14.553 --> 00:15.936
BLIP: Ginny Baker.

00:15.971 --> 00:18.221
Get your big ol' bubble butt over here

00:18.223 --> 00:19.189
and give me a hug.

00:19.224 --> 00:21.024
I didn't see Mike Lawson back in there.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.026
He likes to make a grand entrance.

00:23.062 --> 00:24.144
<i>Total diva.</i>

00:24.196 --> 00:26.196
Hey. Find another scene partner.

00:26.231 --> 00:27.731
I'm here to pitch.

00:27.733 --> 00:28.982
JOE BUCK: This is one of those

00:29.034 --> 00:30.233
moments where you'll remember

00:30.235 --> 00:31.902
where you were when you saw it.

00:31.904 --> 00:33.236
I don't know what's happening. I just...

00:33.238 --> 00:34.571
- I just...
- Okay, okay.

00:34.573 --> 00:35.622
Get me out of the game.

00:35.657 --> 00:36.790
She needs your help.

00:36.825 --> 00:37.874
She quit.

00:37.910 --> 00:39.326
You got a lot of people telling you

00:39.378 --> 00:40.627
who you're doing this for,

00:40.662 --> 00:42.412
<i>and I wonder if it's
not about time you start</i>

00:42.414 --> 00:44.081
<i>doing this for yourself.</i>

00:44.083 --> 00:45.215
<i>You do this for you.</i>

00:45.250 --> 00:46.593
(cheers and applause)

00:46.716 --> 00:48.919
JOE BUCK: Welcome to
the big leagues, Ginny.

00:48.921 --> 00:50.721
We've been waiting for you.

00:51.924 --> 00:54.057
Of course the big story today,

00:54.093 --> 00:55.308
the only story, really.

00:55.344 --> 00:58.145
Yeah, it's Gin-sanity in San Diego.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.518
Ginny Baker becoming the
first woman in history

01:00.519 --> 01:02.699
to win a major league baseball game.

01:02.751 --> 01:03.817
I'm not saying a word.

01:03.818 --> 01:06.203
Uh, listen, my grandmother
throws harder than that.

01:06.205 --> 01:07.838
That's not sexist, it's factual,

01:07.873 --> 01:09.206
and Gram Gram threw heat.

01:09.258 --> 01:10.957
And Gram Gram has a shot at the majors

01:11.009 --> 01:13.154
leave it to the men to try
and rain on our lady parade.

01:13.178 --> 01:14.911
There are already reports of dissention

01:14.947 --> 01:17.447
in the Padres locker
room after Baker's first win.

01:17.449 --> 01:20.283
Guess some of those
big, strong men don't like

01:20.285 --> 01:22.702
the pretty, little girl getting
more attention, huh?

01:22.755 --> 01:25.172
Come on, boys, haven't
you seen the movie?

01:25.207 --> 01:27.290
There's no crying in baseball.

01:27.292 --> 01:29.626
This L.A. road trip could
not be coming at a better time.

01:29.628 --> 01:32.179
Kimmel wants to book
you: lead guest, two segments.

01:32.214 --> 01:33.597
Jimmy Kimmel?

01:33.632 --> 01:35.465
They've got this idea for a comedy bit,

01:35.467 --> 01:38.385
"Ginny Baker's
clubhouse decorating tips."

01:38.437 --> 01:39.686
I got to give decorating tips?

01:39.721 --> 01:40.887
It could be funny.

01:40.939 --> 01:42.083
You just have to tell a few jokes.

01:42.107 --> 01:43.640
We'll talk about it on the ride up.

01:43.642 --> 01:45.036
GINNY: I really ought
to take the players' bus.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.538
I got to be one of the
guys right now, Amelia.

01:46.562 --> 01:47.944
Ginny, look in the mirror.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.090
You are never gonna be one of the guys.

01:49.114 --> 01:50.113
Great movie.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.866
Just One of the Guys.

01:52.901 --> 01:54.234
'80s high school flick.

01:54.286 --> 01:55.702
She pretends to be a guy,

01:55.737 --> 01:57.482
end of the movie she
has to take off her shirt

01:57.506 --> 01:58.488
to prove that she's a girl.

01:58.490 --> 01:59.739
First time I saw...

01:59.792 --> 02:01.741
boobs... I'll be quiet now.

02:01.794 --> 02:02.909
Take the players' bus.

02:07.666 --> 02:09.566
Okay, guys, one at a time.

02:09.601 --> 02:11.478
Game ended two hours ago.

02:11.609 --> 02:14.087
- They're still here.
- Yeah.

02:14.139 --> 02:16.973
She's come a long way from San Antonio.

02:19.928 --> 02:21.394
ANNOUNCER: Hey, sports fans.

02:21.430 --> 02:23.013
Welcome to Wolff Stadium.

02:23.015 --> 02:26.066
San Antonio Missions are warming
up for today's game

02:26.101 --> 02:27.601
against the Midland RockHounds.

02:27.653 --> 02:29.019
Take your seats.

02:29.021 --> 02:31.855

ANNOUNCER: And that's strikeout
number nine for Ginny Baker.

02:47.206 --> 02:49.122
Good win.

02:49.174 --> 02:51.174
I keep hanging sliders.

02:51.210 --> 02:52.937
- You see the one I hung to Archer?
- Oh, yeah.

02:52.961 --> 02:54.961
This new catcher's game-calling sucks.

02:55.013 --> 02:56.713
So, wave him off. You
throw what you want to throw.

02:56.715 --> 02:58.131
He's the catcher.

02:58.183 --> 02:59.216
And you're the boss.

02:59.218 --> 03:00.800
Oh, whoa.

03:00.853 --> 03:02.936
Do you think for a
second you got on that mound

03:02.971 --> 03:04.721
by following anyone else's calls?

03:04.723 --> 03:06.284
You're just saying that 'cause
you're a good brother.

03:06.308 --> 03:08.268
I'm just saying that
'cause you're a good pitcher.

03:09.394 --> 03:10.644
You're a cheeseball.

03:10.696 --> 03:11.895
(chuckles)

03:11.897 --> 03:13.363
- Slider-hanger.
- AMELIA: Ginny?

03:13.398 --> 03:15.510
Hey, I'm sorry, but she
only does autographs for kids.

03:15.534 --> 03:17.295
(laughing): No, no, no,
I'm not... I'm an agent.

03:17.319 --> 03:18.818
I already got an agent.

03:18.871 --> 03:20.654
Oh, you do?

03:20.706 --> 03:21.705
Who are you with?

03:21.740 --> 03:23.623
Hi, Will Baker and

03:23.659 --> 03:26.326
I'm with Stay the Hell Away
from My Little Sister and Company.

03:26.378 --> 03:28.662
- You...
- Hey, that was a good one, right?

03:28.714 --> 03:30.714
Just let me buy you guys a beer.

03:30.749 --> 03:33.300
It'll be the most
important beer of your life.

03:33.335 --> 03:35.886
I promise.

03:39.725 --> 03:41.892
(groans softly)

03:41.927 --> 03:44.144
You know your knees
aren't getting any younger, Mike.

03:44.179 --> 03:46.241
When are you gonna bite the
bullet and move to first?

03:46.265 --> 03:47.430
After I get to first with your mom.

03:47.432 --> 03:49.065
- That's very mature.
- So is your mom.

03:49.101 --> 03:51.067
Guy's strike zone was
inconsistent for her

03:51.103 --> 03:52.903
- for the whole damn game.
- Yep.

03:52.938 --> 03:55.071
Their guy's nibbling, getting
calls on both sides

03:55.107 --> 03:58.074
- of the plate. Us, nothing.
- Yep.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.993
Another good talk, Buck.

04:00.028 --> 04:01.161
Lawson.

04:01.196 --> 04:02.862
- Yeah, Skip.
- My team's broke.

04:02.915 --> 04:05.532
Look, I got pitchers
taking swings at center fielders,

04:05.584 --> 04:07.367
I got a girl
getting dressed in a closet,

04:07.419 --> 04:09.786
I got a pissy
owner, and, on top of that,

04:09.788 --> 04:12.539
now I have psoriasis on my elbows.

04:12.591 --> 04:16.293
So I'm gonna fix my
psoriasis, you fix the other stuff.

04:16.295 --> 04:18.712
I'll talk to the guys tonight.
We'll all go out and celebrate

04:18.764 --> 04:21.214
- her first win.
- How's the knees?

04:21.266 --> 04:22.716
Good, good. Yeah.

04:22.768 --> 04:25.101
Never been better.

04:25.137 --> 04:28.521
- Good. That's good, kid.
- Yeah.

04:30.309 --> 04:31.691
(laughter)

04:31.727 --> 04:33.977
Ginny, when I got

04:33.979 --> 04:35.979
my first win, you know
what I did to celebrate?

04:35.981 --> 04:38.064
You went out drinking with Babe Ruth.

04:38.116 --> 04:40.150
(laughter)

04:40.152 --> 04:42.902
Baker, what's your deal with men?

04:42.955 --> 04:44.988
You a nun or what?

04:44.990 --> 04:47.207
No, not a nun.

04:47.242 --> 04:49.326
Lesbian?

04:49.328 --> 04:50.493
(chuckles)

04:50.495 --> 04:52.662
Sorry to disappoint, but no.

04:52.664 --> 04:53.496
(groaning)

04:53.498 --> 04:54.831
Pay up.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.050
- Stubbs goes down.
- You ever, uh...

04:57.085 --> 04:58.718
you ever hook up with another player?

04:58.754 --> 05:00.337
(chuckles)

05:01.757 --> 05:04.891
Between us...

05:04.926 --> 05:08.311
(sighs) I've got a bit of a...

05:08.347 --> 05:10.814
weak spot for a certain type.

05:10.849 --> 05:12.315
Every time I'm in a locker room

05:12.351 --> 05:14.317
with 'em...

05:14.353 --> 05:18.321
(sighs) something happens to me.

05:18.357 --> 05:19.689
Physically.

05:19.691 --> 05:22.158
I just get a little hot,

05:22.194 --> 05:24.694
you know, inside.

05:24.696 --> 05:26.363
And...

05:26.365 --> 05:27.998
sometimes...

05:32.454 --> 05:34.504
- No, I don't hook up with players.
- (laughter)

05:34.539 --> 05:36.339
Are you out of your damn mind?

05:36.375 --> 05:40.343
(overlapping chatter)

05:40.379 --> 05:42.012
Light turnout.

05:42.047 --> 05:44.297
Wonder why.

05:44.349 --> 05:47.717
NOLAN: ...howling at
their sacred little tree house...

05:47.719 --> 05:51.054
Oh, this isn't gonna help.
Look who's on the tube for a change.

05:51.056 --> 05:52.722
...to the ground. Aw.

05:52.724 --> 05:55.308
Are the big boys on the Padres crying?

05:55.360 --> 05:57.644
Does it get their
panties in a bunch that a girl's

05:57.696 --> 06:00.063
getting asked more
questions than they are?

06:00.065 --> 06:03.867
I'm over this, boys. I'll see
you at the yard tomorrow.

06:05.153 --> 06:07.120
Guys, the facts are clear.

06:07.155 --> 06:08.955
Two starts and one...

06:08.990 --> 06:10.206
Anyone want another beer?

06:10.242 --> 06:12.459
- I'll get it.
- I got it.

06:12.494 --> 06:15.338
...Ginny Baker wears the
pants on the San Diego Padres,

06:15.339 --> 06:16.996
and her whiny, whimpering teammates...

06:17.049 --> 06:19.916
- Hey, you mind changing the channel?
- Sure thing.

06:19.918 --> 06:22.552
...Ginny Baker isn't going anywhere.

06:22.587 --> 06:23.970
I mean, two starts in,

06:24.005 --> 06:26.389
and this kid has a 12 ERA.

06:27.151 --> 06:28.236
One more time?

06:28.260 --> 06:31.094
Let's just settle down.
I'm thrilled she...

06:31.096 --> 06:33.480
There's nothing fuzzy about the
facts in the Florida case.

06:33.515 --> 06:35.482
The track star's own locker room

06:35.517 --> 06:37.150
was under renovation, so she used one

06:37.185 --> 06:39.319
of the men's empty
ones, where she's assaulted

06:39.354 --> 06:41.488
by a member of the men's
track and field team,

06:41.523 --> 06:44.324
who now has the nerve to
call it... wait for it...

06:44.359 --> 06:46.776
"a misunderstanding between friends."

06:46.778 --> 06:49.579
Hey, I wonder what Ginny
Baker would have to say about this.

06:49.614 --> 06:51.114
She's in a locker room with men...

06:54.453 --> 06:57.120
That should do it for tonight, huh?

06:57.122 --> 06:59.339
- Shots, anybody?

07:31.707 --> 07:34.909
- Did you find it?
- Not yet.

07:34.911 --> 07:37.411
- Irma might have washed it.
- Washed it?

07:37.413 --> 07:40.047
That's my slump-buster.
You know it can't be washed.

07:40.574 --> 07:43.292
Honey, calm down. You're
hitless in two games.

07:43.327 --> 07:44.877
I will find that awful,

07:44.912 --> 07:46.712
smelly T-shirt. I'll drive it up later.

07:46.747 --> 07:48.414
- No, but if it's been washed...
- What,

07:48.416 --> 07:51.166
your Grandmaster Flash
T-shirt will lose its magic powers

07:51.218 --> 07:52.885
and you won't make the All-Star team?

07:52.920 --> 07:55.637

Hey. Hey!

07:57.842 --> 07:59.308

team that matters is mine,

08:02.096 --> 08:05.647
and you're already the leading
vote-getter there.

08:05.683 --> 08:07.733
- What would I do without you?
- You'd die.

08:07.768 --> 08:09.830
I will die if you don't find that shirt.

08:09.854 --> 08:12.020

09:13.801 --> 09:16.235
Buck, she needs to trust
the changeup more, right?

09:16.270 --> 09:17.325
Yep.

09:17.326 --> 09:19.100
She needs to be
willing to throw the fastball

09:19.101 --> 09:20.117
when I call for it, right?

09:20.141 --> 09:21.256
Yep.

09:21.308 --> 09:22.257
Guy's a genius.

09:22.309 --> 09:23.475
And now I'm going to L.A.,

09:23.511 --> 09:25.238
where I have to see my
pain-in-the-ass ex-wife

09:25.262 --> 09:27.095
who's just hellbent on ruining my life,

09:27.148 --> 09:28.458
even though we're no longer married.

09:28.482 --> 09:29.960
She wants me to go through my things,

09:29.984 --> 09:32.267
you know, before she
sells them. (scoffs)

09:32.319 --> 09:34.498
What she really wants to do
is get back together with me.

09:34.522 --> 09:37.489
Why did God make me so
damn appealing to women?

09:37.525 --> 09:39.658
I mean, it's a... it's
a curse, Baker. Really is.

09:39.693 --> 09:41.910
Why'd you call me off?

09:41.946 --> 09:45.080
My fastball tops out at
87. I don't always trust it.

09:45.115 --> 09:47.010
All right. Well, you
may not trust your fastball.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.250
You need to trust me.

09:48.285 --> 09:50.536

you want a manager tomorrow.

09:56.210 --> 10:00.045
Davey McGee. We already have a
caveman for a manager, Oscar.

10:00.047 --> 10:03.048

fresh, somebody inspiring.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.717

drive to work using their feet

10:05.719 --> 10:07.135

10:07.188 --> 10:08.470
Someone like you.

10:08.522 --> 10:09.888
You think I hired you as my GM

10:09.890 --> 10:11.557
just 'cause you're good at your job?

10:11.559 --> 10:13.358
I hoped so.

10:13.394 --> 10:15.527
Well, that and you
look like Spanish Superman.

10:15.563 --> 10:18.030
- I'm Mexican.
- Yeah.

10:18.065 --> 10:21.033
Uh, I know Al was
your old skipper, Oscar,

10:21.068 --> 10:22.868
and I know that he gave you your start.

10:22.903 --> 10:25.120
He didn't just give me my start, Frank.

10:25.155 --> 10:29.124
I-I was a lifetime 230 utility
infielder, and look at me now.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.375
He bought me my first suit.

10:30.411 --> 10:32.661
He's godfather to my daughter.

10:32.713 --> 10:35.330
This is exactly why I
don't like to get too close

10:35.382 --> 10:36.999

been to my house for dinner.

11:01.114 --> 11:02.780
where the eyes of the sports world

11:02.782 --> 11:04.865
- have been on Ginny Baker.
- AL: It's about time...

11:04.918 --> 11:07.084
This just surfacing, video
from two years ago

11:07.120 --> 11:10.621
of Padres manager Al Luongo,
commenting on Ginny Baker,

11:10.623 --> 11:13.874
- then only a Double-A minor leaguer.
- Oh, crap. Blip.

11:13.927 --> 11:16.460
AL: Yeah, well, I hope she
makes it to the show one day.

11:16.462 --> 11:17.795
I mean, have you seen her?

11:17.797 --> 11:18.879
Easy on the eyes.

11:18.932 --> 11:20.381
I'm sure a lot of the guys

11:20.433 --> 11:21.860
would love to have
her in the locker room.

11:21.884 --> 11:24.170
VASGERSIAN: Well, the
comments are obviously troubling,

11:24.171 --> 11:26.950
especially in light of the ongoing
track and field incident

11:26.951 --> 11:27.972
- in Florida...
- What?

11:31.839 --> 11:35.931
_

11:38.676 --> 11:41.043
Ginny, we got a little
P.R. problem on our hands.

11:41.095 --> 11:42.377
Have you seen Al's comment?

11:42.379 --> 11:44.107
You want me to issue a
statement supporting him?

11:44.131 --> 11:46.515
We don't require it. It's up to you.

11:46.550 --> 11:48.350
But if you'd like to...

11:48.385 --> 11:49.384
Ginny, can I...

11:49.386 --> 11:50.635
speak to you for a minute?

11:50.688 --> 11:53.055
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

11:54.391 --> 11:56.391
You want to come out in
support of a misogynist

11:56.443 --> 11:58.110
who made comments about your looks?

11:58.145 --> 12:00.177
I told you I want to be
one of the guys.

12:00.216 --> 12:03.398
How many of the guys are
being asked to make statements?

12:03.450 --> 12:05.400

12:12.409 --> 12:13.542

WILLIE: So, after our father died,

12:17.698 --> 12:20.132
Ginny was pretty much doing
this whole thing by herself.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.000
Felt too big for one person,

12:22.052 --> 12:24.653

- You flunked out of school.

12:24.688 --> 12:26.638
Really? Okay, fine.

12:26.673 --> 12:28.390
I didn't make it past one damn semester.

Will. You should sign with her.

Look... she called
every local news outlet.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.543
Story's already going
viral and national,

30:22.595 --> 30:24.462
and I don't know how she did it.

- So she made a few phone calls.
- No, no. You're not hearing me, sis.

I don't... I literally do
not know how she did that.

30:43.282 --> 30:45.199
She's the real deal.

I mean, two weeks
ago, I was in the minors,

32:37.563 --> 32:40.514

Kimmel, and I can see myself.

32:40.566 --> 32:42.183

32:42.235 --> 32:45.269
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm
on the show, too, and, uh,

32:45.271 --> 32:48.672
so I can really... I have
equal amounts of excitement. Yeah.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.124
I'm sure.

32:50.159 --> 32:52.443
You are probably the biggest star

32:52.495 --> 32:54.612
in the whole world right now.

32:54.664 --> 32:57.448
- I mean, yeah.

32:57.450 --> 32:59.333
- TOMMY: This ain't a team.
- Got a problem?

32:59.368 --> 33:01.655
- Take it outside.
- I'll take you outside.

33:01.656 --> 33:03.120

33:15.351 --> 33:18.469

changes in the Padres clubhouse.</i>

33:39.279 --> 33:43.088

33:54.844 --> 33:56.627
Um, I'm...

33:56.629 --> 33:57.440
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

33:57.514 --> 33:59.829
I can't talk about
decorating tips tonight.

33:59.881 --> 34:01.614
I mean, the jokes are really funny,

34:01.650 --> 34:03.666
- but I just... I...
- Well, now I know

34:03.702 --> 34:05.780
you're making excuses,
because the jokes are not funny

34:05.804 --> 34:07.148
- tonight at all, but... it's...
- (laughter)

34:07.172 --> 34:09.138
You know, it's exciting.

34:09.174 --> 34:12.175
- I mean, it's exciting for the
audience to have you here. - Thanks.

34:12.226 --> 34:15.295
In person to see you
like this, right? Oh.

34:15.330 --> 34:19.599
- (applause and cheering)
- Thanks. Um, yeah. I'm sorry.

34:19.601 --> 34:22.018
I didn't want to make it
weird about the decorating tips.

34:22.070 --> 34:24.771
- It's fine. It's okay. It's
no-no problem at all. - Yeah.

34:24.822 --> 34:27.774
- Um, it's just, I'm a ballplayer...
is the thing. - Mm-hmm.

34:27.775 --> 34:31.159
And I'm just working really
hard right now to be one of the guys.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.996
- Yeah. Well, sure.
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:37.085 --> 34:40.168
Our manager's in trouble, guys. Hmm?

34:42.841 --> 34:44.706
He could get canned any day.

34:44.759 --> 34:48.844
This is the same guy who
takes the blame when we lose,

34:48.880 --> 34:51.880
when it's us who plays Hacky
Sack with the baseball.

34:54.553 --> 34:58.304
Yeah, same guy who
didn't just convince Stubbs' ex

34:58.306 --> 35:01.357
not to sell their
honeymoon pictures to a tabloid.

35:01.393 --> 35:05.562
He bought 'em, all to
protect his own player.

35:07.449 --> 35:09.315
Is Ginny getting us more attention? Huh?

35:09.367 --> 35:11.317
(laughing): Yeah. Yeah, she is, man.

35:11.369 --> 35:12.902
Which sucks, 'cause we're losing

35:12.954 --> 35:15.154
in front of sold-out crowds.

35:15.206 --> 35:17.657
I gave my life to this game!

35:21.212 --> 35:23.913
Ugh. So I got a radical idea, mooks.

35:23.965 --> 35:25.832
Hear me out here.

35:25.834 --> 35:28.918
How about we start winning
in front of sold-out crowds?

35:28.970 --> 35:30.837
How about

35:30.839 --> 35:34.040
we start winning for Al and his job?

35:34.075 --> 35:36.192
How about you start
winning for your captain, too?

35:36.227 --> 35:38.194
It's a weird line to draw, I guess.

35:38.229 --> 35:41.180
- Not everyone loves interior
design, I guess, you know? - Yeah.

35:41.232 --> 35:45.602
I mean, I'm a 23-year-old
girl with a high school education.

35:45.654 --> 35:49.022
How did I end up with a
bunch of microphones in my face,

35:49.074 --> 35:50.740
and everyone wanting my opinion?

35:50.775 --> 35:52.942
It seems like I'm sort
of making a statement

35:52.994 --> 35:54.694
just by existing lately, so, right.

35:54.696 --> 35:57.030
I mean, what the hell.
Why not make a few more?

35:57.065 --> 35:59.198
My manager says a lot of stupid things,

35:59.250 --> 36:03.119
and some of them are about
me, but he's a great manager,

36:03.171 --> 36:05.038
and he's a really good man.

36:05.090 --> 36:06.789
And he knows that he
messed up, you know.

36:06.841 --> 36:08.424
We're gonna shock the world.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.876
And yeah, we're gonna do it

36:09.878 --> 36:11.628
with a pretty girl in the dugout.

36:11.680 --> 36:16.265
Yeah, pretty girl, who, by the way,

36:16.301 --> 36:19.485
works a hell of a lot
harder than you lazy losers.

36:19.521 --> 36:22.722
So everyone can worry
about some idiot comment

36:22.724 --> 36:26.609
that he made, what, two
years ago, 'cause I won't be.

36:26.645 --> 36:29.612
I mean, there's bigger
things to worry about.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.134
I mean, a... a woman...

36:37.789 --> 36:39.455
You need a minute? You okay?

36:39.491 --> 36:41.124
- Yeah.
- Yup.

36:41.159 --> 36:44.794
A woman's not responsible
for her own sexual assault

36:44.829 --> 36:46.796
because she went in
the wrong locker room.

36:46.831 --> 36:49.082
That's not only wrong. It's dangerous.

36:49.134 --> 36:51.751
We don't need to make sure

36:51.753 --> 36:53.586
that every girl goes in the right room.

36:53.638 --> 36:56.422
We need to make sure every
boy knows it's wrong to rape.

36:56.424 --> 36:59.258
(applause and cheering)

37:01.479 --> 37:04.764
So maybe...

37:04.766 --> 37:07.350
...we all start working as hard as her.

37:07.402 --> 37:09.435
Maybe we start

37:09.487 --> 37:12.188
acting like a team instead
of a bunch of spoiled brats.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.273
♪ Have no fear... ♪

37:14.325 --> 37:18.111

37:30.925 --> 37:32.675
You're an inspiration to so many people,

37:32.711 --> 37:35.128
and it's really a pleasure

38:44.532 --> 38:46.449
From now on, I talk

38:46.501 --> 38:48.201
I say what I want to say.

38:48.253 --> 38:53.372
I call you off, Amelia,
not the other way around.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.792
I'm the boss.

38:59.964 --> 39:03.266
Why does a high-powered
movie agent come to South Texas

39:03.301 --> 39:06.102
in high heels to sign a
minor league baseball player?

39:18.783 --> 39:21.134
We'll try again.

39:21.169 --> 39:23.452
We've only done two rounds.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.404
I think I'm done, Amelia.

39:25.456 --> 39:27.573
We can afford
another round of IVF, Eric.

39:27.609 --> 39:30.059
No, I mean, I'm done.

39:30.094 --> 39:33.029
Having a baby is not gonna fix us.

39:36.384 --> 39:38.851
I don't want this life anymore.

39:41.322 --> 39:43.856
I don't want a life with you anymore.

39:55.687 --> 39:58.104
Aren't you gonna say anything?

40:02.660 --> 40:05.661
You just obliterated my life
in two sentences, Eric.

40:07.248 --> 40:09.949
Forgive me if I don't give
you the satisfaction

40:10.001 --> 40:13.119
of seeing me cry.

40:17.892 --> 40:19.458
We need to talk about this X-Men thing.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.210
They want to do a
prequel to the prequel,

40:21.246 --> 40:24.380
so I guess with,
like, what, four-year-olds?

40:24.432 --> 40:27.300
I actually think that's kind of genius.

40:27.302 --> 40:30.303
MAN: We need a kid's director,
but we need somebody with an edge.

40:30.355 --> 40:33.397
WOMAN: I like Robert
Rodriguez. He's edgy.

40:33.536 --> 40:35.932
<i>MAN: Who's the guy that
did The Rugrats Movie?</i>

40:36.066 --> 40:37.707
Maybe we could get him in here.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.903
I quit.

40:51.459 --> 40:53.876
I will go with you!
