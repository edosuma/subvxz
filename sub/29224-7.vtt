<i>Look, here's the problem
with Clay Jensen.</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:40.832
<i>Wait, strike that.</i>

00:41.416 --> 00:43.835
<i>There are a number of problems
with Clay Jensen.</i>

00:44.002 --> 00:46.671
Clay, a minute ago you told me

00:46.755 --> 00:49.299
- you just went over there to talk to him.
- I mean, I did.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.402
- That's just talking?
- It's not what it looks like.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.387
- What do you think it looks like?
<i>- Behind that nice guy surface,</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:56.139
<i>there's a whole bloody mess.</i>

00:56.639 --> 00:57.974
<i>And if you're a friend of his,</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:01.478
<i>you sometimes find yourself getting
dragged into that mess along with him.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:04.063
I talked him down and we walked away.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.707
What would've happened
if you hadn't been there to talk him down?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.277
I don't think anything.
I mean, Clay wasn't going to...

01:09.402 --> 01:13.907
If anything, he would've hurt himself.
I was more worried about him than Bryce.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.659
Did you go over there
with the intention of killing Bryce?

01:16.743 --> 01:19.454
- No, I was just... angry.
- About what?

01:23.166 --> 01:26.377
It was the day we found out that Bryce was
going to get away with... everything.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.104
But he didn't get away with everything.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.090
Yeah... he did.

01:30.173 --> 01:33.093
So, you were trying to avenge Hannah Baker
by killing her rapist?

01:33.176 --> 01:35.178
No! If you look, I didn't do anything.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.889
Back then. Someone stopped you.
Where'd you get the gun?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.641
From...

01:40.266 --> 01:43.228
this guy I found on the internet.
I never learned his name.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.631
Did you bring it to Bryce's a couple weeks
ago when you threatened to kill him then?

01:46.689 --> 01:48.149
- No.
- Then where is the gun?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.319
What happened to the gun?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.657
Justin got rid of it that night.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.742
He threw it in a dumpster downtown
somewhere.

01:58.868 --> 02:02.247
I threw it out,
behind some restaurant downtown.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.167
I really didn't want Clay to...
try and hurt himself.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.752
Or try to hurt Bryce again?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.841
- No. That night was the end of it.
- It wasn't really, was it?

02:11.047 --> 02:13.466
It wasn't the last time
you confronted Bryce.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.888
- Clay hadn't told you about this?
- No.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.348
Did you know Clay had a gun?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.519
- Have you ever seen him be this volatile?
- No.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.313
How well do you know Clay?

02:27.814 --> 02:28.857
Not all that well.

02:29.566 --> 02:33.194
- Well, he picks you up for school. Often.
- We're partners...

02:33.987 --> 02:34.821
in robotics.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.489
We're not really close friends.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.159
Well, you know he had
a long-standing hatred for my son?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.453
- I know there was bad blood.
- You knew they fought,

02:42.537 --> 02:45.248
brutally,
when Clay came over to buy drugs.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.499
I didn't know that.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.585
But you know about Hannah Baker?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.128
Only very little.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.714
Clay wasn't terribly eager
to talk about Hannah.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.049
Neither was Bryce, for that matter.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.595
Did Bryce and Clay have any reason
to fight...

02:59.053 --> 03:00.597
- over you?
- No.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.099
No, I mean, I can't imagine.

03:03.641 --> 03:07.228
Well, the police have Clay and Justin
down at the station now.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.170
They'll sort this out.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.318
Ani,

03:14.777 --> 03:16.196
I know this must be a shock,

03:17.447 --> 03:21.159
to discover that a boy you cared about,
a boy who seemed good,

03:21.784 --> 03:23.870
could be capable of something so violent.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.291
- My mother...
- Doesn't need to know.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.168
For now.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.131
<i>It turned out there was a lot
I didn't know about Clay.</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:39.093
We found your fingerprints outside
the driver's side door of Bryce's car.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.972
My friend lives at Bryce's house,
I've been around there a lot.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.475
- Your friend Ani?
- Yes.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.227
- Your girlfriend?
- Just friend.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.103
If she had a boyfriend,
would you be jealous?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.396
She didn't have a boyfriend.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.400
No, but you care for her,
feel protective of her?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.192
Everyone feels protective
of their friends.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.570
Yeah, but maybe you thought
you needed to protect Ani,

03:57.779 --> 04:01.532
from Bryce, kind of how you thought
you were trying to protect Hannah

04:01.616 --> 04:03.576
- back then.
- I wasn't protecting Hannah.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.995
- Hannah was dead!
- Because you failed to protect her.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.391
Maybe without Hannah,
you were looking for another girl to save.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.125
I wasn't trying to save anyone!

04:11.209 --> 04:13.836
And Ani was living
with the person who hurt Hannah.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.171
That's not the same at all!

04:15.755 --> 04:16.755
Ani is...

04:17.089 --> 04:18.089
nothing like Hannah.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.220
<i>Clay and I had fun together.</i>

04:22.428 --> 04:23.428
<i>At first.</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:25.723
<i>He had opinions, so did I.</i>

04:26.057 --> 04:27.600
You're speaking insane things.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.102
You're being very defensive.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.938
You just ripped my favorite character
to shreds.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.066
That's where you went wrong,
choosing Percy as your favorite character.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.318
Terrible decision. Your taste is shit.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.029
- Sorry.
- Your taste is shit, sorry!

04:40.321 --> 04:42.865
You actually root for Astrid and Zymorx!

04:42.949 --> 04:46.035
He's a douchebag robot
with the good pieces of his brain missing.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.247
- Astrid deserves better.
- Astrid is a self-sufficient healer

04:49.372 --> 04:51.165
who chooses to see the best in everyone.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.127
Need I remind you
that Percy's only personality trait

04:54.210 --> 04:55.628
is to save everyone?

04:57.880 --> 04:58.965
Oh!

04:59.549 --> 05:01.050
Okay, now I get it.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.054
I hate you so much.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.138
No, you don't.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.517
Now, stop holding my coffee hostage
with your bad opinions.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.103
Give it here.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
No.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.065
Say you like Percy.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.068
- No.
- Say you like Percy.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.029
- No.
- That's how you're gonna get the coffee.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.657
- You like Percy. That...
- Knock knock. Parent entering.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.745
Hi, Mom. Um... this is... this is Ani.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.165
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Jensen.

05:32.248 --> 05:35.585
It's very nice to meet you, too.
I've heard so much about you.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.336
You have?

05:37.670 --> 05:38.671
Fascinating.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.133
<i>We had a good deal in common.</i>

05:42.675 --> 05:43.676
<i>We're both nerds.</i>

05:43.760 --> 05:45.636
It is not "dress up," it's cosplay.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.805
Explain the difference.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.016
Oh, come on. You're quite deep into

05:50.183 --> 05:52.894
at least half a dozen
different mythologies and universes,

05:52.977 --> 05:55.938
and you're obsessive
about what is and isn't <i>AKR </i> canon.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.649
<i>Turtlebot </i> was a spin-off for kids
and the creators disavowed it.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.301
Right, and you're pretending
you don't know what cosplay is.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.446
And that you haven't been dying
to do it.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.490
I hate costumes.

06:05.948 --> 06:09.077
Like, I even hate Halloween,
and I love candy.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.830
You spend your life hiding from people
and you hate costumes.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.499
Okay.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.753
Don't do that "I'm quite perceptive"
thing, it's annoying.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.464
But what you're wearing now
is a costume.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.510
We're all in costumes all the time, trying
to become the thing we're wearing.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.096
If that were true,
I would've become a hoodie

06:28.179 --> 06:29.180
a long time ago.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.683
I mean, haven't you ever fantasized
about being Percy?

06:33.267 --> 06:34.852
About saving the world?

06:35.603 --> 06:36.854
Why else do you read <i>AKR?</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:41.818
For the story lines
and the literary quality.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.154
Oh, yeah, the literary quality,
<i>Alien Killer Robots.</i>

06:45.238 --> 06:46.238
Okay.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.907
Well...

06:48.950 --> 06:51.369
It lets you escape into another world.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.790
Away from all the things you have to do
and be in this one.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.834
You can become someone else.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.044
And that's cosplay, as well.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.214
I don't...

07:05.174 --> 07:06.968
Look, A, I'm terrible with costumes.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.177
Oh, I've got you.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.344
I...

07:09.846 --> 07:11.514
already got a start on your look.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.014
And mine.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.058
<i>We were friends.</i>

07:15.685 --> 07:16.685
<i>Just friends.</i>

07:17.478 --> 07:21.107
<i>So, I never thought there'd be any reason
for him to be jealous of anyone.</i>

07:21.190 --> 07:24.485
What do you know about the interactions
between Ani and Bryce?

07:24.569 --> 07:25.987
She told me they barely talked.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.351
- That she kept her distance from him.
- You believed her?

07:28.531 --> 07:29.531
Yes.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.909
<i>But apparently, I was wrong.</i>

07:33.411 --> 07:35.121
<i>And I learned
it wouldn't be the first time</i>

07:35.204 --> 07:36.914
<i>Clay loved a girl
who didn't love him back</i>

07:36.998 --> 07:38.332
<i>like he wanted her to.</i>

07:38.958 --> 07:39.959
- Jess.
- Hey.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.128
- Have you heard from Justin?
- No. Why?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.589
He and Clay are with the police.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.507
They found security footage

07:46.966 --> 07:50.970
of Clay literally pointing a gun at Bryce
and Justin trying to talk him down.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.220
Shit!

07:52.680 --> 07:55.016
Of course that house
had a security camera.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.642
Wait, you knew this happened?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.978
- Yeah, Justin told me about it.
- Jess, do you...

07:59.687 --> 08:00.938
You don't think Clay...

08:01.898 --> 08:04.317
You don't think he could've actually
done something, do you?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
No! I don't...

08:07.278 --> 08:08.278
I don't know.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.907
Was he in love with Hannah?

08:11.699 --> 08:12.700
Did he not tell you?

08:13.659 --> 08:17.038
- About Hannah, the tapes, the trial?
- Almost nothing.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.539
Jesus!

08:19.457 --> 08:20.457
In here.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.754
So, Clay went after everyone
on the tapes?

08:25.296 --> 08:27.465
I mean,
I knew he could be obsessive, but...

08:27.548 --> 08:29.800
And when the trial started, it was like...

08:30.259 --> 08:31.636
he cared more about Hannah

08:32.595 --> 08:35.222
than me or anyone else who was alive.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.602
I mean, that's not fair, because I think
he knew that I was hurting, but...

08:39.684 --> 08:40.727
But he didn't respect that

08:40.811 --> 08:45.149
- you weren't ready to speak about it?
- I mean, I'm glad I ended up testifying.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.026
After everything.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.903
It made me feel stronger.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.532
But after that night, after Bryce,

08:53.574 --> 08:55.326
I was constantly afraid.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.913
I had to go to school every day
and see him.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.666
I was just starting to get over that,
and Clay...

09:03.292 --> 09:04.877
God, he made me feel...

09:07.338 --> 09:08.338
hunted.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.134
Do you know where Clay went
after Homecoming?

09:12.969 --> 09:14.303
Did he go home with Justin?

09:16.013 --> 09:17.181
Justin was with me.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.435
But Tony was with Clay at the game,
maybe he knows where he went after.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.938
- Right.
- You don't think

09:24.021 --> 09:26.190
Clay had anything to do with Bryce?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.818
- I don't want to.
- The trial was months ago.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.612
Hannah was a year ago. Why would he?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.155
Now? It just...

09:33.239 --> 09:35.032
I... I don't know.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.702
I don't know anything.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.998
I have to go.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.717
- Let me know if you hear from them.
- Right.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.750
Yeah.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.879
<i>That fan boy shit is charming
when it's about robots,</i>

09:50.047 --> 09:53.801
<i>but when it's about a real live girl,
it doesn't seem so charming.</i>

09:53.884 --> 09:57.555
Ani's fingerprints were found all over
the inside of Bryce's Range Rover.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.432
- Okay.
- That's not odd to you?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.767
You said she kept her distance from him.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.853
Maybe he gave her a ride to the store
or something.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.938
She helps her mom out
with groceries sometimes.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.356
Sure, that could be it. Or,

10:07.690 --> 10:09.900
maybe Ani and Bryce hung out together
sometimes.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.694
- Maybe they were friends.
- They weren't.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.280
Living together,
being around each other all the time.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.449
Hard to believe
they didn't get to know one another.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.410
I think they knew each other a little bit,
but that's all.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.580
You don't think it's possible
that they were intimate?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.040
No.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.815
We found those in Bryce's room.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.805
Had them tested.
We found semen that belongs to Bryce,

10:39.889 --> 10:42.099
and some blood that doesn't,
not his type.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.936
We thought maybe
they were his ex-girlfriend's.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.897
So, we asked Chloe Rice.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.024
Turns out not her blood type either.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.400
How was there blood?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.694
Just traces. Not uncommon.
Maybe menstrual.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.363
Might be aggressive sex.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.615
They never had sex. Those aren't Ani's.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.298
We're gonna get a DNA sample.
We'll know for sure in about a week.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.205
I think those underwear do belong to Ani.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.458
And that she and Bryce were intimate.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.795
Maybe it was consensual.
Maybe it wasn't.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.130
Either way, I think you found out,

11:13.214 --> 11:15.174
and it was more than you could handle.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.723
You have to breathe,
so I can get your true measurement.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.851
- I'm breathing.
- You're not. At all.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.729
♪ <i>So I can still hold you</i> ♪

11:29.397 --> 11:31.482
<i>♪ Just as tight ♪</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:34.777
<i>♪ And everybody knows that day like ♪</i>

11:35.569 --> 11:37.738
It's possible I'm sensitive
about my chest.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.866
You have nothing to be sensitive about.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.993
I think partial nudity
is always sensitive.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.706
But men walk around with their shirts off
all the time.

11:46.789 --> 11:50.960
I am not now, nor have I ever claimed
to be, a man.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.669
Okay.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.132
Well, my turn.
You have to get a close measurement.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.842
For the leggings.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.362
Wait. We can just measure
over your clothes

12:00.386 --> 12:02.221
- and subtract the...
- Just calm down

12:02.304 --> 12:03.305
and measure.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.068
Clay, is there something
you want to tell me?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.320
There's got to be a reason for those.
She...

12:18.612 --> 12:21.824
- She didn't have sex with Bryce.
- I know it's got to be upsetting

12:21.907 --> 12:24.410
to think of those two together.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.580
Because you loved her, didn't you?
You loved Ani.

12:27.663 --> 12:31.125
Just like you loved Hannah.
And Bryce destroyed them both.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.836
- Excuse me.
- We're done here. Clay, let's go.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.421
We're having a friendly conversation.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.304
No, you're interrogating him.
And you're harassing him. And we're done.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.426
- Clay gave his consent.
- Did Justin? He's 17.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.136
- We left word for you.
- At my old firm.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.899
That's hardly reasonable effort
to contact.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.724
- This is a homicide investigation!
- Are you making an arrest?

12:46.807 --> 12:48.350
I'm taking them both home. Now!

12:48.434 --> 12:51.114
<i>I learned that even his best friends
have very different ideas</i>

12:51.187 --> 12:53.314
<i>- of who he really is.
- That's fucked up.</i>

12:53.397 --> 12:55.117
I mean,
I knew Clay was messed up back then,

12:55.191 --> 12:58.336
- but I didn't know it got that bad.
- It was a rough time for everybody though.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.112
- For you, too.
- Yeah, but...

13:00.196 --> 13:02.907
Do you guys know where Clay went
after Homecoming?

13:02.990 --> 13:06.744
It was his night with Tyler,
and they left together after the game.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.370
- In the Prius?
- Yeah.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.374
- Do you know where they went?
- Ask Clay.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.999
- Or Justin.
- Jess said that

13:12.082 --> 13:14.335
Justin was with her after Homecoming,
not Clay.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.754
Wait, she told you that?

13:17.421 --> 13:18.631
Clay didn't do anything.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.884
- He threatened to shoot Bryce.
- That was a long time ago.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.127
- Where did he even get a gun?
- It was one of Tyler's.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.096
Clay and Justin
got rid of it after.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.141
Look, Clay doesn't have it in him
to do something like this.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.936
He thinks too much.
He doesn't just go off on people.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.022
He went off on Bryce. About Hannah.
Everyone heard it.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.483
Wait, you mean the fight at Bryce's house?

13:37.566 --> 13:38.776
That was one time.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.986
Okay, I'm just saying.
He got crazy about Hannah.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.072
Like, when he found out
that Zach slept with her,

13:43.197 --> 13:45.757
even when he found out that
I just kissed her, like, as a friend.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.494
That was just jealousy.
What does he got to be jealous about now?

13:55.125 --> 13:56.544
So, you don't...

13:57.127 --> 13:59.088
I mean,
going with your whole imagining thing,

13:59.171 --> 14:01.966
like, immersing yourself in the <i>AKR </i> world,

14:02.466 --> 14:03.466
you just, like,

14:03.676 --> 14:05.261
don't find Percy attractive

14:05.344 --> 14:06.344
at all?

14:06.720 --> 14:07.888
He's just not my type.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.516
Well, what... what is your type?

14:10.599 --> 14:12.017
I don't know, really.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.689
I don't believe that I have just one type,
now that I think of it.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.943
So, you don't have a type,
but Percy is not your type?

14:21.235 --> 14:23.195
This is very important to you.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.698
No, it's not. It's...

14:28.325 --> 14:29.618
It's totally not.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.578
Just joking.

14:31.912 --> 14:37.126
I sometimes worry that Percy
might take everything too seriously,

14:37.209 --> 14:40.087
and some things are meant to be just fun.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.007
Yeah. I get it.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.968
<i>I learned Clay could be jealous.</i>

14:47.386 --> 14:49.597
<i>Which I hadn't realized.</i>

14:50.264 --> 14:52.099
If you want to catch a nap
under the table,

14:52.182 --> 14:53.309
we'll kick you at the bell.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.394
I was up till midnight.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.479
- Mm-hmm?
- Doing laundry.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.689
My mom makes me do it.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.608
Yeah, mine too.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.067
Yeah, but at midnight?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.486
Like, it can't wait a day?

15:04.570 --> 15:08.115
Well, you have to learn how to work.
Nothing will be handed to you on a plate.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.410
Yeah, she made sacrifices
so that I could have opportunities.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.328
Mm-hmm.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.662
My mom used to make me clean,

15:13.746 --> 15:16.749
but then I just made a point
of being really bad at it, so...

15:20.878 --> 15:23.213
Yeah, I don't really have that option.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.842
And then on top of that,
I asked my mom if she could make a list

15:26.926 --> 15:29.094
of, like, which chores I had to do
on which day, but...

15:29.178 --> 15:31.805
she doesn't show me the list.
She doesn't show me anything.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.569
Then every day, there's this new list
and that list just never ends.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.186
Well, she doesn't want to leave you
any time for trouble.

15:37.269 --> 15:41.148
Yeah, well, if I actually do have
free time and I want to spend it,

15:41.231 --> 15:43.031
I have to come up
with a really elaborate lie.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.401
Oh, yeah. I know.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.739
I'm a member of at least six
non-existent academic clubs.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.282
- Six?
- Mm-hmm.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.243
- Can I join?
- Oh, absolutely.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.916
Why didn't you call me
right away?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.167
I didn't want you to worry.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.794
- Well, we're worried.
- Clay...

16:01.961 --> 16:03.801
Justin said you were brought in
last week, too.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.024
It was just random.
They were talking to a lot of kids.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.443
So why would you agree to talk to them
again without a lawyer

16:08.467 --> 16:10.748
when they clearly think
you had something to do with this?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.523
Because I don't have anything
to do with it.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.658
- We're getting you a lawyer.
- Clay didn't do any...

16:14.682 --> 16:17.768
- Okay, let's just... Let's take a minute.
- He had a gun in his hand, Matt.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.979
- Yeah, that was nothing.
- Nothing?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.396
A gun is nothing?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.106
Where did you get it?

16:23.774 --> 16:24.817
Where is it now?

16:25.901 --> 16:27.444
Clay, what the fuck were you thinking?

16:27.528 --> 16:30.614
It doesn't matter, okay? I was upset
and I borrowed the gun from a friend

16:30.698 --> 16:32.032
- and gave it back.
- What friend?

16:32.574 --> 16:34.386
- Justin, do you know?
- Leave him out of this.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.290
Clay, you don't understand
what's going on here.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.956
- I didn't do anything.
- But the police think that you did.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.082
Yeah, but I didn't!

16:40.165 --> 16:42.352
You know as well as I do
the court system is not perfect

16:42.376 --> 16:44.096
and that innocence is not
a perfect defense.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.630
You don't believe me?
You think I did something?

16:47.256 --> 16:50.017
- I don't fucking believe this!
- Okay. Hey, let's just take a breath.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.052
- Dad, you believe me, right?
- Of course I do.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.936
Clay, we will take care of this.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.349
We will move heaven and earth to keep you
safe. But you need to tell us everything.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.392
No more lies.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.394
- I never lie!
- You withheld.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.187
You think... I could kill someone?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.772
It doesn't matter what I think.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.857
Yes, it does!

17:44.021 --> 17:45.022
Fuck!

17:48.609 --> 17:49.609
Fuck.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.914
He was a little out of his mind
that night, but it was just that night.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.167
I drove him home. I talked him down.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.795
- He was fine.
- And the gun?

18:07.961 --> 18:08.961
He gave it back.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.422
To?

18:13.759 --> 18:17.012
When you say he was out of his mind,
how do you mean that?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.889
It was that day.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.976
All the stuff that Bryce said in court,
he couldn't get Hannah out of his head.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.437
Like he couldn't stop thinking about her,
or...

18:26.105 --> 18:28.232
like he was hearing her
in his head?

18:28.315 --> 18:30.275
Just that he was...

18:31.276 --> 18:33.445
he was thinking about her, a lot,

18:33.529 --> 18:35.449
- I guess.
- Is Clay having his nightmares again?

18:38.492 --> 18:43.372
Justin, we know that you care about Clay
and you want to keep his secrets,

18:43.956 --> 18:46.708
- but the time for secrets has passed.
- I know, I just...

18:49.670 --> 18:51.255
I was one of his secrets once.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.763
He dropped me off around 11:00,
then left again.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.974
Did he say where he was going?

19:02.057 --> 19:04.143
No, but I figured he was headed home.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.606
Clay didn't do anything to Bryce.
He wouldn't.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.191
He hated him.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.275
Everybody hated him.

19:12.776 --> 19:16.029
But Clay's a really good person,
and he wouldn't hurt anyone.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.615
Jessica told me that he hurt you once.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.118
He sent a photo of you around.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.286
Yeah.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.581
He did.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.083
And I guess I hated him for it.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.710
Back then.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.340
I mean, I did worse.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.258
To Hannah.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.677
And Courtney.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.929
That doesn't make it right, though.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.056
I don't know
what makes what right anymore.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.854
All these people hurt me.

19:54.568 --> 19:58.906
And I hurt some of them, and I don't know
how any of that gets made right.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.701
All I know is the only one
who ever reached out,

20:03.202 --> 20:06.455
the only one who ever really gave a shit
about me, was Clay.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.297
<i>I knew Clay didn't like Bryce.</i>

20:15.881 --> 20:17.341
<i>I just didn't know how much.</i>

20:18.425 --> 20:21.845
Sorry to disturb.
I was looking for my mum.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.056
She's bathing my grandfather.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.100
She's a fucking saint, you know that?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.811
- It's her job.
- Nah.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.897
She cares about people.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.107
She's gentle with him.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.693
He stops cursing.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.862
Mm-hmm, well,
she's not gentle all the time.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.114
Oh, don't get me wrong,
I'm scared shitless of her.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.699
Yeah. Me too.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.246
But she's all I have, so...

20:47.621 --> 20:48.621
She loves you.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.083
Yeah, quite a lot.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.463
So...

20:58.548 --> 21:00.092
nice watch, that.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.928
My dad's in Geneva.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.888
He sent me an apology.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.474
No note or anything, but...

21:08.475 --> 21:10.394
it's implied by the price tag.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.520
Do you miss him?

21:17.276 --> 21:19.069
Kind of hope I never see him again.

21:24.908 --> 21:25.908
So...

21:29.037 --> 21:31.415
you and Clay Jensen are hanging out?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.042
We're just friends.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.461
I bet he has some things to say about me.

21:36.753 --> 21:37.796
Well, he doesn't like you.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.880
Yeah.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.174
That's an understatement.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.385
Do you?

21:45.345 --> 21:46.513
Like me?

22:17.669 --> 22:19.963
<i>I didn't understand
the depth of his feelings.</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:22.007
<i>All his feelings.</i>

22:24.134 --> 22:25.134
Holy shit!

22:26.136 --> 22:27.387
Your side looks like my side.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.556
They talk to you about me?

22:30.015 --> 22:31.224
Yeah. I didn't say anything.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.102
- How does it feel?
- What?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.146
- To be the good kid.
- Dude...

22:36.897 --> 22:39.274
- come on. I'm on your side.
- Whatever.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.445
What did the cops say to you?

22:43.528 --> 22:45.155
They think Bryce and Ani...

22:46.239 --> 22:47.282
had a relationship.

22:48.533 --> 22:52.120
- Had sex.
- What, like, he raped her

22:52.204 --> 22:54.831
- or, like, they had a thing?
- Either,

22:54.915 --> 22:56.625
- I guess.
- What do you think?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.337
She told me they never did.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.505
You believe her?

23:02.798 --> 23:03.798
I don't know.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.064
<i>I should have realized
that Clay was</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:08.595
<i>invested in our friendship</i>

23:09.179 --> 23:10.680
<i>in a different way than I was.</i>

23:19.856 --> 23:22.275
I just continue to be impressed
that you can sew.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.735
My dad taught me.

23:25.904 --> 23:30.409
Which, like,
I think is supposed to be embarrassing

23:31.034 --> 23:32.035
for me or my dad.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.121
When, in fact, it's neither.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.670
Uh, why do we...
why do we only do this here?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.295
What do you mean?

23:43.338 --> 23:47.300
I mean, we only ever work over here,
you leave all your stuff here.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.738
If I'm not supposed to be embarrassed
about any of this, then...

23:51.388 --> 23:52.388
are you?

23:53.056 --> 23:55.934
It's just easier.
You have the place to yourself.

23:56.726 --> 24:00.439
My mom makes an excuse to come in here
at least twice every time you're here.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.316
- And there's always the threat of Justin.
- Mm-hmm.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.445
Does your mom know
that we're working on this together?

24:06.653 --> 24:08.530
Does your mum know everything you do?

24:08.947 --> 24:11.616
Well, clearly yes, lately.

24:12.909 --> 24:13.909
Well, it's just...

24:15.328 --> 24:16.246
This is for me.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.874
You know? Mum doesn't need to know.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.585
She has this idea of who I am, and it's...

24:22.210 --> 24:23.628
It's best I leave her to it.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.089
Separate worlds, you know?

24:30.051 --> 24:34.931
She doesn't know the things you love,
like cosplay and stuff?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.892
It's just easier.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.768
- Seems harder.
- Trust me,

24:38.852 --> 24:41.271
it is way easier for all involved

24:41.354 --> 24:44.608
if I just be what people need me to be
when they need me to be it.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.443
That seems like a lot of pressure.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.736
No, not really.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.779
I like how it works.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.828
<i>I should've seen
that he has a problem with boundaries.</i>

24:56.912 --> 25:00.790
I just want to point out that
Zymorx would rudely drive up the hill

25:00.874 --> 25:04.294
and introduce themself to your mother,
and possibly atomize her.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.005
- Percy, however...
- Is well trained.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.635
I'm starting to come round
to the virtues of Percy.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.096
Okay, I'm just saying...

25:20.227 --> 25:23.605
Listen, you know you don't have to
be anyone with me, right?

25:24.731 --> 25:27.025
Like, any particular anyone, except you.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.319
Is all you have to be. For me.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.281
I mean, not that you have to be for me...

25:33.949 --> 25:35.617
Although I'm glad you are being for me.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.244
With me.

25:39.496 --> 25:40.497
Near me.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.221
Shit, sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.433
I fundamentally disagree.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.479
Hey, what up, Jensen?

26:05.105 --> 26:07.983
- Ani, you need a ride up the hill?
- She's fine. She likes to walk.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.526
Who likes to walk?

26:10.151 --> 26:11.151
Ani, ride?

26:13.029 --> 26:14.029
No, thanks.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.712
- Ani, are you okay?
- All good. See ya.

26:30.797 --> 26:31.797
Wait, you...

26:35.594 --> 26:37.929
There was never anything romantic
between me and Clay.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.849
I mean, we never even kissed or anything.

26:44.227 --> 26:47.105
<i>But I realize now
that didn't stop him from being jealous.</i>

26:48.857 --> 26:50.066
How can I go in there?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.193
Everyone thinks I'm a murderer.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.738
Shall we just skip or something?

26:56.489 --> 26:58.491
That seems like not a good idea, right?

27:01.703 --> 27:03.788
You know, you just gotta walk
back in there like...

27:04.164 --> 27:06.791
like you know the truth
and just fuck everybody else.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.628
It's the only way to walk back in there.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.548
Clay.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.260
- Hey, Tony.
- What the hell?

27:17.344 --> 27:19.012
They had you down there all day.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.433
Yeah, I was trying to break your record
and stay all night, but...

27:24.851 --> 27:26.436
- Sorry, that was humor.
- Listen,

27:26.853 --> 27:28.438
Ani has been asking around.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.439
About Homecoming.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.651
About where you were after the game.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.693
She was?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.739
If you need cover, I got you.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.991
- Cover?
- For whatever.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.702
Why would I need cover
if I didn't do anything?

27:44.245 --> 27:46.665
- Come on, Clay.
- Where were you that night, Tony?

27:46.915 --> 27:48.249
Can you account for every minute?

27:49.376 --> 27:50.377
Wait, Clay...

27:51.461 --> 27:52.461
Clay!

27:56.758 --> 27:58.134
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:58.593 --> 27:59.803
You're lying for Justin?

28:00.261 --> 28:01.721
Alex, Jesus. Calm down.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.307
You told Ani that you were with Justin
after Homecoming?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.976
- What the fuck?
- Alex, you need to calm down.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.311
How far will you go for him?

28:08.853 --> 28:11.523
- He didn't do anything.
- What the fuck are you doing?

28:12.816 --> 28:14.901
- Alex, I'm afraid of you right now.
- Why?

28:14.984 --> 28:16.194
Why are you afraid of me?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.532
Justin told me that you've been juicing?
For months?

28:20.615 --> 28:24.119
Of course Justin told you that.
It has nothing to do with anything.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.746
This, the way you are, all of this. This...

28:27.872 --> 28:28.915
This isn't you.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.586
Fine. Okay. Keep lying, Jess.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.756
You know, keep lying
so that you can keep fucking Justin!

28:42.429 --> 28:44.013
He came home at, like, 1:30.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.058
Where was he before that, do you know?
Any ideas?

28:47.142 --> 28:48.935
- He wasn't killing Bryce.
- How do you know?

28:49.018 --> 28:50.478
Because that's not who he is.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.189
But he's the guy that brings a gun
to Bryce's house? The guy

28:53.273 --> 28:55.153
- you have to talk out of using it?
- One night.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.861
He was that guy one night.

28:58.611 --> 29:01.698
The rest of the time, he's the guy
that'd save your life if it needs saving.

29:01.781 --> 29:04.325
One night he <i>was </i> that guy,
he could've been once more.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.453
Do you really think he could do it?

29:07.078 --> 29:07.996
Do you believe that?

29:08.079 --> 29:11.124
Or are you trying to do anything
to deflect the fact that you fucked Bryce?

29:11.207 --> 29:12.207
What?

29:13.001 --> 29:15.003
I'm sorry, what gives you the idea

29:15.086 --> 29:18.131
- that I...
- I don't have secrets with Clay. Do you?

29:18.381 --> 29:20.717
If he wasn't with you that night,
then where were you?

29:20.800 --> 29:21.843
You know what, Ani?

29:23.136 --> 29:24.136
Fuck off.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.933
We agreed, not at the funeral.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.686
No, you said not at the funeral,
we did not agree.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.106
People were in mourning!
They were in pain!

29:35.190 --> 29:37.442
Well, fuck their pain,
what about your pain?

29:37.525 --> 29:39.027
And every girl he raped?

29:39.110 --> 29:42.280
And every girl who got attacked
in that fucking clubhouse

29:42.363 --> 29:43.865
or at every party?

29:44.365 --> 29:45.450
What about the girl

29:46.034 --> 29:49.662
who went over to hang out with friends
and got raped on a basement floor?

29:50.538 --> 29:52.874
- Look, I get it.
- No, you don't.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.668
You don't get shit. If you did,
you wouldn't be back with Justin.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.965
I don't have to defend my choices to you.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.676
My personal life
has nothing to do with this.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.930
Your personal life has everything
to do with it, are you fucking kidding me?

30:07.013 --> 30:10.975
This is a fight, Jess, and you started it!
And you can't finish it, and that's fine.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.395
That's fine! But you are not going
to stand in the way

30:14.479 --> 30:16.981
of those of us who actually want
to make things change!

30:17.065 --> 30:20.276
But you're not making any change,
you're just making noise!

30:20.360 --> 30:22.320
I am making them uncomfortable!

30:22.821 --> 30:26.074
I am reminding them
that their actions have consequences.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.409
When I shout, they look in my direction

30:28.493 --> 30:30.870
and they see the pain
that I feel every minute!

30:31.996 --> 30:35.708
I will make them understand
that I will never yield from this

30:35.792 --> 30:37.001
and I am not okay!

30:38.294 --> 30:40.547
And you going back to the guy

30:41.130 --> 30:43.967
who let you get raped is not okay!

30:45.760 --> 30:48.721
Things are always way more complicated
than you think.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.016
Not this one,
this one seems pretty fucking simple.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.237
What the fuck's going on, guys?

31:04.320 --> 31:07.448
I just have to say, with respect to
everybody, you're my fucking hero.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.578
Jessica Davis is scary as shit,
but... she's so hot.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.581
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You've been holding out on us!

31:14.956 --> 31:17.142
Turns out the reason she wants
to shut down guys' sports

31:17.166 --> 31:19.127
is so you'll have more time to bone her.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.129
Let's go! On the field!

31:28.928 --> 31:31.097
- I don't want to hear it, Zach.
- You love her, right?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.311
So, don't listen to what anybody else
says. Just take care of her.

31:37.854 --> 31:38.854
Yeah, I mean...

31:39.355 --> 31:40.355
I will.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.067
So...

31:43.985 --> 31:46.195
The cops. They don't think
you actually have anything

31:46.279 --> 31:47.572
to do with Bryce, do they?

31:47.697 --> 31:49.407
- They think Clay did it.
- What?

31:50.033 --> 31:51.367
Why, what do they think?

31:51.451 --> 31:52.911
I mean, he hated Bryce.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.122
Dude, how the fuck did everyone find out?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.625
- About me and Jess.
- Who knows, man?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.710
No one's secrets are safe these days.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.550
<i>I know Justin feels
like Clay saved him,</i>

32:08.301 --> 32:11.971
<i>but in the beginning, at least,
it was for Clay's own purposes.</i>

32:12.931 --> 32:14.933
<i>And "saved" is debatable.</i>

32:31.616 --> 32:33.117
<i>I'm sorry about kissing you.</i>

32:37.246 --> 32:39.540
Well, I kissed you, technically.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.875
Yes.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.046
I'm sorry you regret it.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.631
No, I don't regret it.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.093
I don't have regrets, ever. I just...

32:51.427 --> 32:53.554
- shouldn't have done it.
- That seems like regret.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.308
Can we... not talk about this?

32:58.810 --> 32:59.810
Oh, yeah.

33:05.775 --> 33:06.975
Why didn't you tell me?

33:08.903 --> 33:10.405
You don't know the whole story.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.323
You were lying to me the whole time.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.992
- As long as I've known you.
- No!

33:14.075 --> 33:16.244
You're a liar!
You even told me that yourself.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.664
I was so stupid. People always tell you
who they are. You just have to listen.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.587
- And you're a fucking liar.
- That's not fair.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.085
You know, all this shit about Bryce
that keeps coming out,

33:24.168 --> 33:25.848
I keep giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.880
And all that time,
I thought I did something wrong.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.675
You didn't want to kiss me
because you were kissing him.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.385
No, that's not the whole story!

33:32.468 --> 33:34.220
Then what is the fucking story, Ani?

33:34.721 --> 33:37.199
Because I had to sit there
as the cops showed me your underwear

33:37.223 --> 33:40.309
- with Bryce's fucking cum on them!
- Okay. Right. You need to calm down.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.113
You're always whoever you need
to be, right?

33:42.520 --> 33:45.023
Who were you with Bryce
who you couldn't be with me?

33:45.106 --> 33:48.317
You just thought I was some lonely girl
with her walls up,

33:48.401 --> 33:51.571
waiting for the right guy to break
them down and save me from myself.

33:51.654 --> 33:52.654
Bryce!

33:53.364 --> 33:55.241
To save you from Bryce! The guy who...

33:55.324 --> 33:57.910
Who you refused to see
as anything but a monster

33:57.994 --> 34:00.455
rather than a human being
who was actually trying to change.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.790
- Bullshit!
- Would you want your entire life

34:02.874 --> 34:04.917
to be judged
by the worst thing you'd ever done?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.252
He was a rapist!

34:06.335 --> 34:08.713
Okay, Tyler nearly murdered all of you

34:08.795 --> 34:10.556
and you did everything you could
to help him.

34:10.630 --> 34:11.841
That is not the same.

34:12.632 --> 34:13.632
Bryce didn't deserve...

34:13.676 --> 34:16.637
So only Clay Jensen gets to decide
who's worth saving?

34:16.721 --> 34:18.431
Oh, so that's why you fucked him?

34:19.139 --> 34:22.143
- To save him?
- Clay, just don't be a fucking child.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.562
- Were you in love with him?
- It's not that simple!

34:24.645 --> 34:27.273
It's super simple, Ani. Yes or no?

34:28.983 --> 34:30.025
Yes or no?

34:31.485 --> 34:33.237
He was never gonna get better, Ani.

34:34.237 --> 34:37.241
No matter what you did.
He was always going to be who he was.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.913
This whole fucking world is better
without him in it.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.876
Where did you go after Homecoming?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.585
After the fight?

34:50.213 --> 34:51.297
What did you do?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.517
It's my mum. I've got to go.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.184
Of course you do.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.313
<i>Clay sees the world
the way he sees it.</i>

35:08.606 --> 35:10.066
<i>Does what he thinks is right.</i>

35:11.317 --> 35:13.402
<i>And has trouble seeing it any other way.</i>

35:22.912 --> 35:24.372
Are these your underwear?

35:27.542 --> 35:28.542
No, sir.

35:31.546 --> 35:37.093
Ani, did Bryce ever do anything
or try to do anything to you

35:37.426 --> 35:38.845
that you didn't want him to?

35:40.096 --> 35:41.096
No, sir.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.846
And you're friends with Clay Jensen,
is that correct?

35:47.228 --> 35:49.272
Yeah, we're school friends. Classmates.

35:49.605 --> 35:52.233
Did Clay ever mention anything
about Bryce to you?

35:52.984 --> 35:56.612
When we first met, he warned me
about things Bryce had done.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.949
Did you ever say anything to Clay
about your home life with Bryce?

36:02.243 --> 36:04.036
Clay knew that I lived there.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.167
But other than that, I keep my home life
and my school life separate.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.043
And you and Bryce, you were friends?

36:12.461 --> 36:13.461
Not really.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.637
That was so close!

36:23.222 --> 36:25.933
I thought my mum was off tonight?
I'm so fucked!

36:26.017 --> 36:28.269
Oh no, it's fine.
Come on, we'll sneak out the window.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.730
No. We're on the third floor.

36:30.813 --> 36:33.413
Oh, shit. You're right.
I didn't even think of that. I'm so sorry.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.193
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe she won't recognize you

36:35.276 --> 36:36.276
in your hat.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.571
Why do I ever say yes to you?

36:38.654 --> 36:41.824
Oh, come on.
There's some amazing shit in that attic.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.951
I'm never hanging out with you ever again.

36:44.744 --> 36:45.912
You're evil.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.333
I... I know. I'm... I'm sorry.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.337
I didn't mean it.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.756
No, I know, but I just...

36:57.506 --> 36:59.884
I shouldn't have
risked you getting in trouble.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.552
You've been really nice to me.

37:46.764 --> 37:50.851
<i>When Sheriff Díaz called me in
last week for that first interrogation,</i>

37:51.602 --> 37:54.230
<i>- I lied.</i>
- Do you think it's possible

37:54.313 --> 37:57.566
that Clay thought
Bryce had done something to you

37:57.650 --> 37:59.568
and he went after him on your behalf?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.821
- There was nothing for him to think.
- Okay.

38:01.904 --> 38:06.075
Good. So you wouldn't mind
taking a DNA test for us?

38:06.158 --> 38:07.493
Amorowat is a good girl.

38:07.576 --> 38:09.370
She has nothing to do with any of this.

38:09.453 --> 38:12.331
She knows better than to get caught up
in schoolboy drama.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.253
<i>I lied about Bryce.</i>

38:19.046 --> 38:21.590
And if Clay had known the truth,

38:22.341 --> 38:23.341
well...

38:24.677 --> 38:27.013
it could've been enough motive
for him to kill.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.145
You're obliterating me.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.605
And this is surprising?

38:37.732 --> 38:38.899
No.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.362
Are you okay?

38:43.696 --> 38:45.990
You seem kind of somewhere else today.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.242
Do we have to talk?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.453
We can do whatever you want.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.329
Great.

38:52.788 --> 38:54.790
<i>Bryce and I, I mean...</i>

38:55.750 --> 39:01.380
<i>we were just two kids, alone
in that big empty house, you know?</i>

39:03.007 --> 39:05.968
<i>It was just...
it was something that happened.</i>

39:11.640 --> 39:13.893
Wait, slower. Slow, slow, slow, slow.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.603
- I'm almost there.
- Okay.

39:15.853 --> 39:16.853
Slower.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.484
Fuck!

39:31.369 --> 39:32.369
Oh, fuck!

39:35.039 --> 39:36.039
Fuck.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.126
Sorry.

39:40.586 --> 39:41.587
It's all good.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.090
No, you said slower. I just...

39:45.716 --> 39:46.716
I don't know.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.052
Hey...

39:50.513 --> 39:52.765
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.146
We shouldn't be doing this.

40:00.606 --> 40:01.774
It's not good.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.485
Well, it seemed good for you.

40:04.860 --> 40:05.903
Just now.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.822
I mean for you.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.119
Why would you...

40:14.787 --> 40:16.038
Why do you even want to?

40:18.582 --> 40:19.875
I like you,

40:20.626 --> 40:21.752
I guess.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.503
Why?

40:24.713 --> 40:25.798
I don't even like me.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.340
Hey.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.678
- Hey, come on now...
- There's something wrong with me.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.516
There's something seriously wrong.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.353
You shouldn't be here.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.151
I'm fucked up.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.072
Maybe not forever.

41:15.973 --> 41:16.973
Let me do you.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.101
Do you even know how?

41:19.727 --> 41:20.728
Yes, I do.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.398
I think. You know what?
I'm actually not sure.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.610
- But I bet you can instruct me further.
- I can.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.113
<i>No, I didn't love him.</i>

41:31.572 --> 41:32.572
<i>It was...</i>

41:32.781 --> 41:33.824
<i>I wasn't thinking.</i>

41:34.200 --> 41:37.369
<i>You want things even when you shouldn't,
and you don't know why.</i>

41:37.661 --> 41:38.661
Ani...

41:39.663 --> 41:41.790
Your mom's gonna be up soon.
You should go.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.501
No. Five more minutes!

41:51.258 --> 41:52.468
- Hey, Ani?
<i>- </i> Mmm?

41:53.636 --> 41:54.636
You're...

41:54.887 --> 41:56.055
um...

41:57.765 --> 42:01.393
I've never felt like this with anyone...

42:02.061 --> 42:03.229
about anyone...

42:04.104 --> 42:05.104
before.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.148
So...

42:08.817 --> 42:12.738
yeah, I don't know what that means,
but I just wanted to tell you that.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.914
<i>What happened
between me and Bryce...</i>

42:23.624 --> 42:24.708
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

42:25.876 --> 42:28.796
<i>And I certainly couldn't talk about it
in front of my mother.</i>

42:47.898 --> 42:48.899
Hey, buddy.

42:50.776 --> 42:51.777
Ah...

42:52.695 --> 42:54.655
you knew this was coming, right?

42:57.324 --> 43:00.244
The dead don't stay dead in your life.
Not for long.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.871
- You're not here.
- You think I'm gone?

43:03.372 --> 43:04.832
You think you got rid of me?

43:05.165 --> 43:07.626
I'm fucking immortal, Jensen.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.503
I'll live as long as you do.

43:10.212 --> 43:13.757
Every time you look at Jessica,
or think about Hannah...

43:14.883 --> 43:15.884
or look at Ani,

43:16.510 --> 43:18.345
- I'll be right there.
- Fuck you.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.639
You think
you're gonna get out of this town,

43:21.557 --> 43:22.933
go off to college...

43:23.601 --> 43:24.601
I'll be there.

43:24.893 --> 43:27.563
Graduate, get some shit job,

43:28.355 --> 43:29.355
I'll be there.

43:29.940 --> 43:33.986
Or maybe you get some sweet gig
in finance,

43:34.069 --> 43:36.614
maybe you'll be a lawyer, like your mom,

43:37.031 --> 43:39.116
and I will be all over that shit.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.202
I'll be everywhere you look
as long as you live.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.204
Fucking Jessica.

43:45.914 --> 43:46.914
Fucking Hannah.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.628
- Fucking Ani.
- No!

43:53.964 --> 43:55.424
You can't punish me...

43:56.884 --> 43:58.135
but you can punish her.

44:00.679 --> 44:01.679
You're dead.

44:02.556 --> 44:03.891
You are gone from this Earth,

44:03.974 --> 44:06.310
you are a bloated corpse
with a hole in your head!

44:06.393 --> 44:07.686
I may be gone from this Earth,

44:09.104 --> 44:11.690
but I will be reborn in the bodies
of a million men.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.068
And there is nothing,

44:14.902 --> 44:18.113
there is nothing you can do to stop me.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.623
You're not well, Clay.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.208
You need help.

44:36.256 --> 44:38.936
The minute you hire a lawyer,
it looks like you're hiding something.

44:38.967 --> 44:41.345
Not hiding, preparing. Protecting.

44:41.637 --> 44:43.597
I spoke to Dennis about a plea bargain,

44:43.681 --> 44:45.599
we might come at it
from a mental health angle.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.142
Are you even listening to yourself?

44:47.226 --> 44:49.478
Justin said Clay had Hannah in his head,

44:49.561 --> 44:52.147
not just thinking about her,
but in his head.

44:52.439 --> 44:54.358
You remember how angry Clay was?

44:54.566 --> 44:56.485
If it comes out he had something,

44:56.568 --> 44:58.278
- anything to with this...
- He didn't.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.949
He got a gun. He went to that boy's house.
He pointed it at him.

45:02.032 --> 45:03.152
He pointed the gun at Bryce,

45:03.200 --> 45:04.993
- then he pointed it at his own head.
- Yes.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.263
- Matt, I saw the tape.
- He was out of his mind.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.287
Exactly!

45:10.499 --> 45:13.252
You don't seriously believe
Clay is capable of taking life?

45:14.253 --> 45:15.933
Can you tell me that in the past two years

45:16.004 --> 45:18.124
you haven't been surprised
by what Clay is capable of?

45:26.765 --> 45:28.642
<i>You were right
about a lot of things.</i>

45:29.351 --> 45:31.353
<i>Clay Jensen is a dangerous kid.</i>

45:31.854 --> 45:34.898
<i>He's self-righteous,
entitled and obsessive.</i>

45:35.232 --> 45:36.232
Clay?

45:39.820 --> 45:40.821
Clay, are you here?

45:41.613 --> 45:42.990
<i>But could he kill someone?</i>

45:44.450 --> 45:45.951
<i>Could he take a life?</i>

45:51.582 --> 45:53.500
<i>I'll admit, I was beginning to wonder.</i>

46:01.467 --> 46:02.551
What are you doing?

46:05.012 --> 46:07.139
- What happened to you?
- I walked home from school.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.808
What the fuck are you doing in my room?

46:15.147 --> 46:16.147
