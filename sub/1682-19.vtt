00:00.720 --> 00:02.249
Kids, you may be wondering

00:02.250 --> 00:04.680
How many of these stories
I'm telling you are true.

00:04.689 --> 00:05.919
It's a fair question.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.249
After all, there's a fine line

00:07.250 --> 00:10.120
Between a good story
and a bald-faced lie.

00:11.332 --> 00:12.454
I've never met anyone

00:12.455 --> 00:14.454
Who could work that line
better than your Uncle Barney.

00:14.455 --> 00:16.784
Heck, he could jump rope with it.

00:16.785 --> 00:18.385
I love to travel myself.

00:18.395 --> 00:19.294
Really?

00:19.295 --> 00:20.994
Where's the best
place you've visited?

00:20.995 --> 00:22.294
Hawaii's nice.

00:22.295 --> 00:24.894
A buddy of mine lives in Seattle.

00:24.895 --> 00:25.664
That's a good spot.

00:25.665 --> 00:27.364
But the best place?

00:27.365 --> 00:29.264
I'd have to say the moon.

00:29.265 --> 00:31.303
Hi. Neil Armstrong.

00:31.423 --> 00:33.841
No! You did not convince
a girl that you were

00:33.893 --> 00:35.672
The first man to walk on the moon!

00:35.792 --> 00:37.922
That happened seven years
before you were born!

00:37.923 --> 00:41.132
Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle.

00:41.133 --> 00:44.462
Oh, yeah, well, our spaceship
passed through a wormhole

00:44.463 --> 00:46.686
Or some gamma Rays or something.

00:46.806 --> 00:49.625
I started aging backwards,
blah, blah, blah.

00:49.651 --> 00:52.271
So, you work in a yogurt shop.
That must be wild.

00:54.044 --> 00:58.000
Although, I did actually work In
a yogurt store in High School.

00:58.046 --> 00:59.631
And it was indeed...

01:00.499 --> 01:02.038
Wild.

01:02.039 --> 01:06.178
Anyhoo, 20 minutes later,
the eagle landed.

01:06.179 --> 01:08.639
We knocked Space boots.

01:08.649 --> 01:11.248
Houston, we have a moaner.

01:11.249 --> 01:15.518
Other Space-related
double entendres.

01:15.519 --> 01:17.360
Why do you feel the need
to lie all the time?

01:17.480 --> 01:18.694
I'm not lying!

01:18.740 --> 01:20.318
Guys, we made sweet love.

01:20.319 --> 01:21.619
I got pictures.

01:25.399 --> 01:26.850
I hate my job.

01:26.930 --> 01:27.972
What are you talking about?

01:27.991 --> 01:29.120
I thought you just
interviewed the mayor.

01:29.121 --> 01:30.620
Mayor mcwoof.

01:30.621 --> 01:33.020
He wears a dog costume and
teaches kids not to litter.

01:33.021 --> 01:35.260
At least He's supposed to.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.660
Oh, I don't want to
talk about mayor mcwoof.

01:37.661 --> 01:42.078
I want to talk about these amazing
insoles From bon appe-feet!

01:42.198 --> 01:44.367
Just look how
shock-absorbent they are!

01:44.405 --> 01:45.973
Prop table! Table's a prop!

01:47.580 --> 01:49.271
We'll be right back.

01:51.141 --> 01:52.610
We'll be right back.

01:52.611 --> 01:54.910
Oh. Sorry, Robin.

01:54.911 --> 01:56.480
Got bored.

01:56.481 --> 01:58.611
Yeah, I don't blame you.

01:59.351 --> 02:04.320
Man, just one decent interview
Would be so nice for a change.

02:04.321 --> 02:07.849
Fine. I'll look at my schedule,
see when I'm available.

02:07.850 --> 02:09.872
But I want a list of
questions ahead of time,

02:09.993 --> 02:11.246
And my personal life is off limits.

02:11.366 --> 02:13.814
Ted, you caught seven
peanuts in a row.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.903
It's impressive,
but it's not newsworthy.

02:15.904 --> 02:19.303
- You caught seven in a row?
- Seven in a row.

02:19.304 --> 02:20.903
But that's not what I'm
talking about that.

02:20.904 --> 02:24.213
No. I'm talking about how
I was selected to build

02:24.214 --> 02:26.605
A scale model of the
empire state building

02:26.725 --> 02:30.413
For the largest recreation Of the
New York skyline in the world.

02:30.414 --> 02:32.653
Is that the thing you were
playing with the other night?

02:32.654 --> 02:34.451
I wasn't playing.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.153
I was working.

02:36.154 --> 02:37.323
"it's you."

02:37.324 --> 02:38.593
"it's me."

02:38.594 --> 02:40.593
"I saw you in the street.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.994
Are you Annie?"

02:42.768 --> 02:43.801
"yes."

02:44.092 --> 02:47.632
Ted, are you acting
out the last scene

02:47.660 --> 02:49.703
Of sleepless in Seattle
with little dolls?

02:51.205 --> 02:52.426
How long have you been out here?

02:52.688 --> 02:53.590
Ten seconds.

02:53.609 --> 02:55.543
Yeah. Just the last scene.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.615
Oh, Ted. Again?

02:58.869 --> 03:00.549
Ooh. That's the pizza.

03:00.587 --> 03:01.839
Baby, do you have any cash?

03:02.393 --> 03:05.464
Oh. You know, uh,
I don't... I actually...

03:05.473 --> 03:07.354
I don't think that I
should Have to pay.

03:08.947 --> 03:11.632
'cause I'm not a fan of pizza.

03:11.752 --> 03:13.501
What?!

03:13.529 --> 03:15.670
Marshall, we've driven
halfway across the country

03:15.673 --> 03:17.929
For a piece of pizza
literally hundreds of times.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.249
I once caught you eating
pizza in the shower.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.519
Marshall, there's a cartoon
of you on our coupons.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.749
I'm not saying Marshall's
a guy who likes pizza,

03:25.750 --> 03:27.078
But last time he went
in for a physical,

03:27.124 --> 03:28.946
Doctor says, "marshall,
you got to stop eating pizza."

03:28.978 --> 03:31.177
Marshall says, "why?" doc says,
"so I can examine you."

03:31.178 --> 03:33.145
But seriously,
we kid because we love.

03:33.265 --> 03:34.839
All right, look, the reason

03:34.867 --> 03:38.191
That I don't have any
money on me is because...

03:40.261 --> 03:41.257
I got mugged.

03:41.491 --> 03:42.887
You...? What?

03:44.507 --> 03:47.361
Can somebody please pay Arthur?
All right? I'm starving!

03:47.390 --> 03:49.172
How's your dad, by the way? Better.

03:49.203 --> 03:51.119
Good. Mm. Mm.

03:51.492 --> 04:01.705
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:04.007 --> 04:05.862
Oh, my God, you got mugged?!

04:05.897 --> 04:06.679
Who mugged you?

04:06.699 --> 04:09.071
Was he wearing a black skull-knit
cap And a five o'clock shadow?

04:09.072 --> 04:10.271
Did he say, "stick 'em up?"

04:10.272 --> 04:13.103
Yes, Barney, because
I got mugged in 1947

04:13.223 --> 04:15.242
At the corner of abbott
and costello. No.

04:15.252 --> 04:18.451
I was cutting through central
park on my way home from work...

04:19.014 --> 04:20.551
Watch it.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.851
Don't get any closer.

04:21.851 --> 04:25.722
It's cool. It's cool.

04:28.462 --> 04:30.691
It was... Completely terrifying.

04:30.692 --> 04:34.261
It was... Completely terrifying.

04:34.262 --> 04:35.201
What are you doing?

04:35.202 --> 04:35.890
I'm rehearsing.

04:35.961 --> 04:37.213
I'm gonna pretend this
happened to me later

04:37.241 --> 04:38.601
To try and get some sympathy sex.

04:39.297 --> 04:40.571
Barney, that won't work.

04:41.141 --> 04:41.981
Will it?

04:42.017 --> 04:43.213
Big time. I'll allow it.

04:43.443 --> 04:47.493
I can't believe Someone pointed
a gun at my marshmallow.

04:47.613 --> 04:48.861
Now, I'm shaking.

04:48.882 --> 04:50.830
I-I don't think I'm going
to be able to sleep tonight.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.410
Oh! Here, sweetie. I have something
that will help you sleep.

04:55.580 --> 04:57.289
Just stick this under your pillow.

04:57.318 --> 04:58.671
You'll sleep like a freakin' baby.

04:58.672 --> 05:00.171
Robin, put that away.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.563
It's not going to hurt anyone.

05:01.622 --> 05:03.920
The safety's... on.

05:04.681 --> 05:05.748
Okay, you know what?

05:05.779 --> 05:07.681
Let's all just relax.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.299
We don't need a gun.

05:09.662 --> 05:12.439
I'd just like to forget
this ever happened

05:12.460 --> 05:13.821
And try to move on with my life.

05:13.822 --> 05:15.999
Just like to forget
this ever happened

05:16.043 --> 05:17.914
And try to move on with my life.

05:18.034 --> 05:18.912
This is great stuff.

05:18.948 --> 05:20.261
I think I'm gonna
add tears, though.

05:20.992 --> 05:24.231
Listen, baby, I know that it's scary,
but look at me.

05:24.599 --> 05:26.402
I'm fine, okay?

05:26.682 --> 05:28.701
Can we just put this behind us?

05:28.702 --> 05:29.551
Oh, that's gold, but I'm going

05:29.671 --> 05:30.971
To switch it to "
put me behind you."

05:32.799 --> 05:34.860
Look, baby, you don't
have to worry about me.

05:34.891 --> 05:38.611
I mean, yes, I'm a little scared,
but I'm a new yorker.

05:38.612 --> 05:40.511
I'm not gonna let this change me.

05:40.512 --> 05:41.979
I've changed!

05:42.582 --> 05:44.433
I'm a gun person now.

05:45.992 --> 05:48.151
Clip! Yeah,
maybe we should just take

05:48.152 --> 05:51.062
A break for a little bit...
I said, "clip."

05:53.292 --> 05:55.761
You want to get a gun?
Not a scary one.

05:55.762 --> 05:58.031
Just a cute, little,
pink beretta that matches

05:58.032 --> 06:00.071
These adorable strappy
sandals I just bought.

06:00.072 --> 06:02.032
By the way,
our new credit card works.

06:02.042 --> 06:03.690
You don't need a gun.

06:03.810 --> 06:06.374
Every statistic in the world
points to the fact that

06:06.372 --> 06:09.381
It's safer not to have a gun
in the home than to have one,

06:09.382 --> 06:11.111
Especially in our home.

06:11.112 --> 06:13.581
You know how I'm always
accidentally injuring you.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.212
Pretty easy, right?

06:17.000 --> 06:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:28.602 --> 06:31.201
Hurry up, baby.
The party's about to start.

06:31.202 --> 06:33.102
Boo!

06:34.872 --> 06:36.001
Oh, my God, Lily!

06:36.002 --> 06:38.201
I thought you were
going as a sexy cat!

06:38.202 --> 06:41.441
I changed my mind.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.711
And now you want to bring
a gun into that equation?

06:43.712 --> 06:47.085
I know, you're right,
but every time I close my eyes,

06:47.205 --> 06:49.721
I picture that guy
pointing a gun at you.

06:50.589 --> 06:52.206
And you're my whole world,
Marshall.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.051
If something ever happened to you,
I would just...

06:54.052 --> 06:55.321
I would just... Okay.

06:55.322 --> 06:58.191
Okay... No, I know. I know.

06:58.192 --> 07:00.261
Okay, look, I've got
to admit something.

07:00.262 --> 07:04.108
That mugging didn't happen exactly
the way that I said it did.

07:04.228 --> 07:07.631
Aha! So he was wearing a black,
skull-knit cap.

07:07.632 --> 07:11.702
Told... Ja! No, he wasn't
wearing A black, skull-knit cap.

07:12.612 --> 07:14.542
He wasn't wearing anything.

07:15.683 --> 07:19.451
Wait, so... Watch it.

07:19.452 --> 07:21.511
Don't get any closer.

07:21.512 --> 07:24.081
It's... It's cool.

07:24.082 --> 07:25.982
It's cool.

07:25.992 --> 07:27.621
He naked-muggered you?

07:27.622 --> 07:30.121
I'm not going to ask where
he was keeping the gun.

07:30.122 --> 07:32.222
Are we sure it was a gun?

07:32.232 --> 07:33.361
Okay, no, guys.

07:33.362 --> 07:38.462
I was, I was walking home from work...
Through central park,

07:38.472 --> 07:41.002
And I stopped at the zoo.

07:43.472 --> 07:46.171
Watch it. Don't get any closer.

07:46.172 --> 07:48.342
Oh, it's cool. It's cool.

07:54.882 --> 08:02.791
You're telling us... That you
got mugged... By a monkey.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.781
I got mugged by a monkey.

08:13.905 --> 08:16.749
You got mugged by a monkey?

08:16.869 --> 08:18.787
Yep, I got mugged by a monkey.

08:18.907 --> 08:21.243
I was embarrassed,
so I made up the other story.

08:21.263 --> 08:23.460
But the point is, Lily,
you don't need a gun.

08:23.699 --> 08:26.035
Oh, forget about the gun.
We're on this now.

08:26.155 --> 08:28.325
Whoa, monkeys are
mugging people now?

08:28.359 --> 08:29.778
It really is a jungle out there.

08:29.898 --> 08:32.571
Oh, my God! That
monkey has our address.

08:32.590 --> 08:33.801
What if he's in a gang?

08:33.921 --> 08:36.461
I hope he doesn't do a swing-by.

08:37.461 --> 08:40.530
Why didn't you just ask the
zookeeper to get your wallet back?

08:40.530 --> 08:42.630
'cause I saw what the
monkey was doing with it,

08:42.631 --> 08:44.301
And I didn't really
want it after that.

08:44.971 --> 08:46.753
Hey, guys. What's up?

08:46.873 --> 08:51.117
Oh, some new information has come
to light on Marshall's mugging.

08:51.237 --> 08:52.840
Oh, really? Did they catch the guy?

08:52.841 --> 08:54.471
Well, he's behind bars.

08:55.141 --> 08:57.140
Well, where did they find him?

08:57.141 --> 09:00.710
Oh, I'm guessing naked in a tree,
throwing his own feces.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.150
Oh, I've seen that guy.

09:02.151 --> 09:03.420
See, that's why I take cabs.

09:03.421 --> 09:05.381
You know how they
caught him, right?

09:06.653 --> 09:09.190
There was a tail on him.
There was a tail on him!

09:10.474 --> 09:12.630
Okay... What is going on?

09:12.750 --> 09:14.945
All right, Robin,
here's what happened.

09:14.966 --> 09:17.161
No-no-no-no! Let me tell it.
It's my story.

09:18.071 --> 09:22.171
You see, young Marshall Was
at the zoo eating a banana...

09:23.844 --> 09:25.810
No, I wasn't eating a banana!

09:25.811 --> 09:27.040
If you're gonna tell it,
tell it right.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.021
Oh, you're right.

09:28.063 --> 09:30.140
The banana was on the ground.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.806
There was no...
There was no banana.

09:45.926 --> 09:48.365
Marshall, I apologize... truly.

09:49.101 --> 09:51.101
Robin, here's what happened.

09:52.231 --> 09:53.370
Oh, God.

09:53.371 --> 09:54.977
Oh, God, don't shoot.

09:55.097 --> 09:57.440
There was no banana! Oh, come on.

09:57.441 --> 10:00.910
Barney, I know, Marshall
didn't get mugged by a monkey.

10:01.714 --> 10:03.410
Marshall?

10:04.117 --> 10:05.341
That part he got right.

10:06.278 --> 10:07.310
Guys!

10:07.311 --> 10:09.680
This is not an
uncommon thing, okay?

10:09.681 --> 10:12.950
In Thailand, in China,
in Costa Rica,

10:12.951 --> 10:14.920
People get mugged by
monkeys all the time.

10:14.921 --> 10:16.160
Monkeys are gatherers.

10:16.161 --> 10:17.865
Because of their
intersocial dynamics,

10:17.985 --> 10:20.290
Having a predisposition
towards stealing

10:20.291 --> 10:22.061
Gives one a genetic advantage.

10:22.731 --> 10:24.869
You were mugged by a monkey!

10:25.097 --> 10:26.900
Maybe he was just curious.

10:26.901 --> 10:28.601
Were you wearing a yellow hat?

10:29.502 --> 10:32.004
Marshall, in all seriousness,
this is a great story.

10:32.018 --> 10:33.670
I mean, can I interview
you about it on my show?

10:33.671 --> 10:35.402
What?! He gets to be on your show?

10:35.430 --> 10:36.710
What about my model?

10:36.711 --> 10:39.410
No one wants to see a guy come
on my show and play with dolls.

10:39.411 --> 10:41.711
Okay, first of all,
that is not what it is.

10:41.721 --> 10:42.950
And second of all,

10:42.951 --> 10:45.181
You just had a guy on your
show playing with dolls.

10:45.191 --> 10:47.090
So, your dolls are favored to win

10:47.091 --> 10:49.060
At the rhinebeck collector
awards next month.

10:49.061 --> 10:51.120
Only if they behave themselves.

10:51.121 --> 10:52.890
Last year, I found
one of them cavorting

10:52.891 --> 10:55.230
With a g.I. Joe.

10:55.231 --> 10:57.230
It's not funny.

10:57.231 --> 10:58.600
What were you thinking?

10:58.601 --> 11:00.431
What if you'd gotten pregnant?

11:01.441 --> 11:03.840
And you invited him back
for a follow-up interview.

11:03.841 --> 11:05.770
Only because the FBI asked us

11:05.771 --> 11:07.840
To keep him occupied while
they search his house.

11:08.670 --> 11:12.361
Come on, Marshall. I need the story.
It's got everything.

11:12.481 --> 11:16.301
Crime, monkeys, no stupid model
of the empire state building

11:16.332 --> 11:17.761
That takes up my entire living room

11:17.783 --> 11:19.851
And makes the whole
place smell like glue.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.660
Come on. Do this for me...
As a friend?

11:24.071 --> 11:26.247
It'd be fun to see you on tv. Yeah.

11:26.465 --> 11:31.030
Okay... Can you promise
to present it in a way

11:31.031 --> 11:32.951
That doesn't make a
joke out of the fact

11:32.970 --> 11:34.422
That I got mugged by a monkey?

11:35.996 --> 11:38.170
You got mugged by a monkey.

11:40.507 --> 11:41.871
Oh, my God.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.565
I just got mugged. What?

11:43.685 --> 11:46.591
Is what I was saying to this
girl at the bar earlier...

11:46.711 --> 11:49.380
It was completely terrifying.

11:49.381 --> 11:50.914
I just want to forget

11:50.951 --> 11:53.690
This ever happened and try
to move on with my life.

11:53.691 --> 11:55.520
Oh, you poor thing.

11:55.521 --> 11:56.920
Neil?

11:56.921 --> 11:59.690
Neil. Neil. I... I... Neil!

11:59.691 --> 12:03.460
Lady, my name's not Neil.
It's bar... Gah-gah!

12:03.461 --> 12:04.961
Why are you calling him Neil?

12:04.971 --> 12:06.500
Because that's his name.

12:06.501 --> 12:07.930
He's Neil Armstrong.

12:07.931 --> 12:10.070
The cyclist? I thought

12:10.071 --> 12:11.901
You were supposed to be
on a shuttle mission?

12:11.911 --> 12:13.740
I thought you just got mugged.

12:15.504 --> 12:17.310
Okay, I can do this.

12:17.311 --> 12:21.280
Uh, uh, you see,
I was on my way to the launch pad

12:21.281 --> 12:24.121
When I was mugged.

12:24.359 --> 12:29.051
And the mugger took
my space shuttle keys.

12:29.061 --> 12:31.360
Nailed it.
Who's up for a three-way?

12:31.361 --> 12:32.760
I am.

12:32.761 --> 12:34.460
Me, too.

12:34.461 --> 12:37.300
And it was the best three-way ever.

12:37.301 --> 12:39.038
Strange, 'cause you look

12:39.059 --> 12:41.330
Like you just had two vodka
tonics thrown in your face.

12:41.331 --> 12:43.570
And you have lime in your hair.

12:43.571 --> 12:45.001
I do?

12:45.811 --> 12:47.929
The story's better with my ending.

12:48.208 --> 12:50.530
Just... Okay?

12:50.881 --> 12:53.710
So, there we are, zero gravity.

12:53.711 --> 12:56.020
The three of us wearing
nothing but space helmets...

12:56.021 --> 12:57.120
Marshall!

12:57.121 --> 12:58.871
You won't believe it.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.120
I pitched the monkey mugger story
To my producer and he loves it!

13:02.121 --> 13:04.761
Oh... Wow. Yeah!

13:04.881 --> 13:06.110
Really? Cool. Yeah!

13:06.118 --> 13:08.161
I mean, who's ever heard of a
guy getting mugged by a monkey?

13:08.194 --> 13:11.400
No one except for the
good people of Thailand,

13:11.401 --> 13:14.300
China, Costa Rica,
and plenty of other countries

13:14.301 --> 13:16.638
Where monkey crime is an
extremely common nuisance.

13:16.681 --> 13:17.981
Well, the best part is,
he said that

13:18.013 --> 13:19.556
It might get picked
up to go national.

13:19.676 --> 13:23.202
Guys, this monkey mugger
story could make me famous.

13:24.808 --> 13:26.704
Me, too.

13:27.481 --> 13:30.336
Guys, this is bad.
I-I can't, I can't do this.

13:30.456 --> 13:32.326
So, it'll be a little
embarrassing... so what?

13:32.446 --> 13:34.860
It's not that. Guys...

13:37.021 --> 13:39.139
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

13:42.857 --> 13:45.458
So, you weren't mugged by a monkey?

13:45.578 --> 13:46.600
No, I wasn't.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.843
So what you're saying is

13:48.963 --> 13:52.438
The monkey tricked you into
giving him your wallet?

13:52.458 --> 13:53.710
No, that's not what I'm saying.

13:53.711 --> 13:55.007
So you mugged the monkey?

13:55.127 --> 13:57.105
Guys, there was no monkey!

13:57.225 --> 13:59.521
It was a human being with a gun.

14:00.604 --> 14:02.790
Are you sure it wasn't one monkey

14:02.791 --> 14:04.923
Standing on another
monkey's shoulders,

14:04.951 --> 14:06.420
Wearing a men's trench coat?

14:06.421 --> 14:07.656
Be about the right height.

14:07.712 --> 14:10.471
No! I... I just made that story up

14:10.481 --> 14:11.737
So that Lily wouldn't get a gun.

14:11.754 --> 14:13.067
The truth is that
it never happened.

14:14.538 --> 14:16.646
I don't buy it. What?

14:16.692 --> 14:19.168
You heard me. I think you
were mugged by a monkey.

14:19.216 --> 14:20.900
You just don't want
to go on Robin's show

14:20.901 --> 14:21.965
'cause you're afraid it'll make you

14:21.987 --> 14:23.778
Look like a big joke.
Well, won't it?

14:23.801 --> 14:25.940
The biggest, 'cause it's so funny.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.305
Well, it never happened, okay?

14:28.348 --> 14:30.730
And I can lie to you guys about
it because you're my best friends.

14:30.790 --> 14:32.026
I am, but go on.

14:32.146 --> 14:35.251
But I can't lie about
it on national tv.

14:37.021 --> 14:38.290
Ted, you've known him the longest.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.591
Is he telling the truth?

14:41.861 --> 14:43.893
Ted, don't...

14:49.978 --> 14:51.802
I can't tell.

14:53.441 --> 14:55.208
He smells good.

14:56.322 --> 14:58.301
But I just can't tell.

15:01.181 --> 15:03.110
Well, I'm still saying it happened.

15:03.230 --> 15:07.320
Maybe. But, Marshall,
if you didn't get mugged by a monkey,

15:07.321 --> 15:09.320
You can't let Robin
report it on her show.

15:09.321 --> 15:10.650
I mean, this could
hurt her credibility.

15:10.651 --> 15:11.355
Oh, please! Journalists
lie all the time.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.890
I'm sorry, but I will believe

15:14.891 --> 15:17.955
That Jack Palance is
dead when I see the body.

15:18.075 --> 15:20.100
Okay, this may come as
a shock to you, Barney,

15:20.101 --> 15:21.730
But people don't
like to be lied to.

15:21.731 --> 15:25.200
Wrong! They don't like finding
out they've been lied to.

15:25.201 --> 15:27.400
"because a lie is
just a great story

15:27.401 --> 15:29.140
That someone ruined
with the truth."

15:29.141 --> 15:30.310
Barney Stinson.

15:30.311 --> 15:34.040
Case in point, what that
girl Sarah did to me!

15:34.041 --> 15:35.910
I think you mean
what you did to her.

15:35.911 --> 15:38.550
No, I mean what she did to me.

15:38.551 --> 15:41.520
The truth is, I'm afraid
the three-way story

15:41.521 --> 15:43.690
Didn't go exactly the
way I said it did.

15:43.691 --> 15:46.191
Nailed it.
Who's up for a three-way?

15:48.713 --> 15:50.190
Lisa, wait.

15:50.778 --> 15:52.091
Yes, Neil?

15:52.101 --> 15:54.601
Oh, you're Lisa? Sarah, wait.

15:56.044 --> 15:57.578
Look.

15:58.459 --> 16:00.251
I'm not Neil Armstrong.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.201
I'm sorry I lied.

16:02.491 --> 16:06.710
Well, I guess I wasn't completely
honest with you, either.

16:06.711 --> 16:08.980
I mean, I said that I was 28,

16:08.981 --> 16:10.680
But the truth is
that I'm really 31.

16:10.681 --> 16:13.020
And if we're being
completely honest,

16:13.021 --> 16:17.491
I went to the doctor the other
day and found out... 31!

16:17.611 --> 16:20.155
I was happy, very happy,

16:20.275 --> 16:24.631
Thinking that I had nailed a
28-year-old with some sun damage.

16:25.143 --> 16:27.230
People want the lie.

16:27.231 --> 16:30.100
Marshall, they need the lie,
which is why,

16:30.101 --> 16:32.900
As far as I'm concerned,
you were mugged by a monkey.

16:32.901 --> 16:35.603
Just as sure as I
had that three-way.

16:35.723 --> 16:39.180
I am the greatest in the world!

16:39.181 --> 16:41.440
Bar... Barney!

16:41.441 --> 16:42.710
Is that the three-way belt?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.751
You know it. Props!

16:46.485 --> 16:48.827
Man, I slept so great last night.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.920
Can you believe I
almost bought a gun?

16:51.921 --> 16:54.691
I'm so glad you got
mugged by a monkey.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.200
Okay... You guys got me.

17:00.201 --> 17:01.585
I was just nervous.

17:01.612 --> 17:03.406
I, I got mugged by a monkey.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.858
Yes! I knew it.

17:04.884 --> 17:06.640
Wait a minute. Now I'm thinking

17:06.665 --> 17:09.069
You really weren't
mugged by a monkey.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.025
Come on, Ted. Why would he
make something like that up?

17:11.056 --> 17:12.329
Yeah, come on, Ted.

17:13.259 --> 17:15.441
Come here.

17:20.021 --> 17:22.217
Okay, seriously,
what is that cologne?

17:22.337 --> 17:24.387
It's intoxicating.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.221
So, late the following night,

17:26.295 --> 17:28.369
We all went to the
set of Robin's show.

17:28.490 --> 17:29.930
Okay, Marshall, now,
don't be nervous.

17:29.931 --> 17:31.123
What we're going to do is
we're going to sit you...

17:31.184 --> 17:33.139
What the hell is this?

17:33.259 --> 17:36.178
I don't know. Looks like
something covered by a sheet.

17:36.571 --> 17:37.711
Guess if you want to find out,

17:37.734 --> 17:39.419
You're going to have
to do a story on it.

17:39.452 --> 17:40.951
You're going to be
covered by a sheet

17:40.982 --> 17:43.070
If you don't get your
stupid model out of here.

17:43.783 --> 17:45.621
Dude, what are you doing?

17:45.977 --> 17:48.680
I don't think Marshall's
going to lie on tv.

17:48.681 --> 17:50.431
And when he backs out,
I want to be there

17:50.451 --> 17:52.211
For my friend, Robin, with a story.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.922
Or rather, 102 stories,

17:54.953 --> 17:58.958
Because that's how tall a certain
iconic New York landmark is.

17:59.361 --> 18:01.326
Now, I want to buy a gun.

18:01.446 --> 18:04.083
Whoa, the monkey's here.
Yeah, surprise.

18:04.104 --> 18:05.344
We thought it would help the story

18:05.403 --> 18:07.360
To bring him here so you
could face your attacker.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.557
Yeah. Because of this incident,

18:09.590 --> 18:12.525
We will be sending Captain
Bobo to a wildlife sanctuary.

18:12.587 --> 18:14.540
Oh, I bet he'll like it there.

18:14.541 --> 18:15.584
No, ma'am.

18:15.874 --> 18:18.444
You see, we'll be splitting
him up from his mate, Milly.

18:19.012 --> 18:21.241
They've been together
for a long time.

18:22.432 --> 18:24.050
His mate's name is Milly?

18:24.357 --> 18:26.372
And then, the interview began.

18:26.492 --> 18:30.020
Marshall, in your own words,
Describe what happened.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.451
Well, I would, I...

18:32.461 --> 18:34.190
I would love to tell you
what happened, Robin.

18:35.144 --> 18:38.230
But I'm just, I'm so curious

18:38.231 --> 18:40.630
As to what is going on
underneath that sheet.

18:40.631 --> 18:42.298
Well, we're not here
to talk about that.

18:42.386 --> 18:44.232
We're here to talk about
your mugging. Right.

18:44.262 --> 18:46.348
Well, people get mugged in
New York City all the time,

18:46.375 --> 18:49.051
Robin, but how often
do you get to see

18:49.270 --> 18:50.638
Whatever's under that sheet?

18:50.672 --> 18:51.715
Mike, can we get a shot of that?

18:51.942 --> 18:53.680
We'll be right back. We're clear.

18:53.681 --> 18:55.110
What the hell are you doing?

18:55.111 --> 18:58.716
Robin, I... I wasn't really
mugged by a monkey, okay?

18:58.744 --> 19:00.480
I just made up that story so
that Lily wouldn't buy a gun.

19:00.481 --> 19:02.248
So you weren't mugged by a monkey?

19:02.282 --> 19:03.284
No, what are you
talking about, baby?

19:03.311 --> 19:04.701
Of course I was mugged by a monkey.

19:04.745 --> 19:05.990
Great, tell it to America.

19:05.991 --> 19:06.941
We're back in five.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.006
No-no-no, not back in five.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.069
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.741
Okay, that's it.
I'm getting a gun. No-no-no!

19:10.774 --> 19:12.630
Don't get a gun.
I was mugged by a monkey.

19:12.631 --> 19:14.141
Well, then Bobo here is going away.

19:14.183 --> 19:15.762
Wasn't! I wasn't
mugged by a monkey!

19:15.882 --> 19:17.544
Ted, do you have any idea if
Marshall was mugged by a monkey?

19:17.574 --> 19:18.413
None whatsoever.

19:18.474 --> 19:21.501
Just tell me, were you or were
you not mugged by Captain Bobo?

19:21.524 --> 19:23.421
Yeah, baby, just tell
us what really happened.

19:23.449 --> 19:25.040
Yeah, Marshall,
just us tell the truth.

19:29.610 --> 19:30.980
And that's when Marshall realized

19:30.981 --> 19:32.820
There was only one
thing he could say.

19:32.821 --> 19:34.027
All right!

19:34.821 --> 19:36.290
Here's the truth.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.091
I...

19:40.440 --> 19:42.360
Am going back to bed.

19:42.361 --> 19:43.990
And that was it.

19:43.991 --> 19:46.882
We never found out what really
happened to Uncle Marshall's wallet.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.502
But we do know this.

19:48.622 --> 19:52.968
Aunt Lily never got a gun,
Robin's credibility remained unimpeached,

19:53.258 --> 19:55.745
And Bobo and Milly lived
out their days together

19:55.776 --> 19:57.340
In the Central Park Zoo.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.940
Damn it.

19:59.941 --> 20:01.505
All right, Ted, mic up.

20:01.764 --> 20:04.050
Mic'd up and made up.

20:04.051 --> 20:05.980
Red leather, yellow leather.

20:05.981 --> 20:08.320
Well, that wasn't very satisfying.

20:08.321 --> 20:09.750
When I tell everyone
at work this story,

20:09.751 --> 20:11.120
I'm saying he was
mugged by a monkey.

20:11.121 --> 20:12.841
And I'm going to keep the
banana on a string thing.

20:12.873 --> 20:13.941
That was working.

20:13.993 --> 20:15.990
Barney, enough with the lies.

20:15.991 --> 20:17.511
You can't just tack on a new ending

20:17.529 --> 20:19.560
Because you're not satisfied
with how a story wraps up.

20:20.075 --> 20:22.061
Oh, really?

20:22.071 --> 20:24.530
Well, mark my words, Mosby.

20:24.531 --> 20:28.340
Someday you'll be telling this story,
you'll see it my way.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.710
Doubtful.

20:29.711 --> 20:31.932
And then, kids, you'll never
believe what happened.

20:32.052 --> 20:33.211
The monkey got loose!

20:34.914 --> 20:36.510
He's got one of my dolls!

20:36.763 --> 20:38.908
Bobo, come here, Bobo.

20:39.028 --> 20:40.556
Bobo... Whow whow whow...

20:40.676 --> 20:42.791
He's climbing the building!

20:45.225 --> 20:46.707
Bobo, come here.

20:47.091 --> 20:49.591
I'll get him.

20:53.401 --> 20:55.400
Is this really happening?

20:55.401 --> 20:57.201
Sure is, Ted.
