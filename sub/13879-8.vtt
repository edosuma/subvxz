00:43.363 --> 00:45.583
Check it out, yo!
It's the Buddy Nugget.

00:45.747 --> 00:46.815
What it do?

00:46.849 --> 00:49.048
Well, you click on it and
it scans your brain for

00:49.050 --> 00:50.983
preferences in life,
love, and hobbies.

00:50.985 --> 00:53.619
Then it emits a signal to
attract others with similar

00:53.635 --> 00:55.669
interests so you can
make new buddies.

00:56.169 --> 00:57.201
It's the Buddy Nugget.

00:57.221 --> 00:58.687
Do me. Let me try.

00:58.689 --> 00:59.789
That won't work.

01:02.293 --> 01:04.927
- Hey!
- Whoa! Oh, my ear.

01:04.929 --> 01:07.396
Do that right by my ear.

01:07.455 --> 01:09.088
It works! It works, y'all!

01:09.108 --> 01:12.176
Look at this. Dewy,
Vanessa, Squirrely.

01:12.712 --> 01:16.376
I hate that y'all had to move, but you
got to go where the jobs are, you know?

01:16.416 --> 01:18.884
See? Now you've got a
whole group of buddies.

01:18.939 --> 01:21.205
At Buddy Nugget, we call
this a buddy basket.

01:21.261 --> 01:24.200
Come on! Let me try it already!
Let's crank this bitch up!

01:24.298 --> 01:25.731
Wait a minute, you might want to

01:25.733 --> 01:27.599
unlock the door so
my fans can get in.

01:36.641 --> 01:41.952
- This is weird. Well, it's a slim broken.
- But it says here likes include
money, and your

01:41.954 --> 01:44.454
turn-offs are friendship,
manners, and people.

01:44.624 --> 01:46.690
- That's about right.
- I like people.

01:47.092 --> 01:49.059
Well, I like the things I get from them.

01:49.061 --> 01:51.061
But that's not what a buddy is, man.

01:51.063 --> 01:52.129
This is the Buddy Nugget.

01:52.131 --> 01:55.507
Well, I call it the Buddy Suckit,
'cause this thing sucks!

01:55.509 --> 01:57.876
It's not gonna suck when
I make a fortune on it.

01:57.923 --> 02:00.631
Just needs a little more field testing to
work the kinks out, you know what I mean?

02:00.649 --> 02:03.016
Do it on you. I want
to meet your buddies.

02:03.018 --> 02:04.781
Oh, no, no, no. I
mean, I've done it.

02:05.554 --> 02:06.319
I-it works.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.610
I just don't want them
knowing my address.

02:08.633 --> 02:09.767
"Them" who?

02:09.769 --> 02:12.136
You know, my... buddy.

02:12.138 --> 02:14.238
Dr. Balthazar.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.961
This ain't gonna give me, like,
crotch cancer or nothing, is it?

02:16.967 --> 02:19.028
No way, dude. Not for
at least 30 years.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.181
And by then, you'll be dead
from cellphone radiation.

02:21.215 --> 02:22.848
Yeah, well, you better be right.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.784
Aah!

02:25.786 --> 02:28.853
So, then, this happens and then

02:28.893 --> 02:32.395
broads just come up here on
their knees to give me oral?

02:32.410 --> 02:34.677
Well, it's not really
for that, you know.

02:34.679 --> 02:35.879
Then what good is it?

02:35.881 --> 02:39.213
Oh, Carl, here comes
your first buddy now.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.460
- Watch out, guy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chief!

02:41.487 --> 02:43.421
How about you watch where
you're walking here?

02:43.429 --> 02:45.559
How about you pay attention to
where you're standing, asshole?

02:45.586 --> 02:48.287
Hey, last time I checked,
I own this puppy, huh?

02:48.289 --> 02:50.622
I walk where I want. What's
it to you, butt-nut?

02:50.624 --> 02:52.891
- You're the butt-nut.
- You want a piece of this?

02:52.893 --> 02:55.193
- You want a piece of this?
- Whoa, easy, guys.

02:55.729 --> 02:57.729
Hey, hey, hey. No shoving here.

02:57.731 --> 03:01.433
It says here that you both like sports.
Am I right?

03:01.435 --> 03:02.794
Yeah, I like sports. So what?

03:02.870 --> 03:04.151
I like sports. Yeah.

03:04.168 --> 03:06.201
- My team's the best.
- I know, right?

03:06.203 --> 03:07.336
- The giants.
- Giants?!

03:07.338 --> 03:08.437
[ Belches ] Jets!

03:08.439 --> 03:11.272
J-e-t-s... jets,
jets, jets, idiot.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.691
Screw you, you fat ginney!

03:12.693 --> 03:13.693
- You want to go?
- Sorry!

03:13.787 --> 03:14.985
- You want to go?
- Sure, bubba.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.720
- See? It works! Kind of.
- Make a move.

03:16.722 --> 03:18.786
You like what I do? How
about when I do this?

03:18.857 --> 03:21.190
What do we got, a gang-bang
going on over here, you two?

03:21.515 --> 03:23.515
- What did you say?
- Yeah, I said it, honey.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.193
- Come over here and say that.
- You step on my friend's lawn,

03:26.195 --> 03:27.327
I'm gonna bust your ass!

03:27.329 --> 03:30.596
- Your car is badass.
- Yeah, I know.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.087
- Too bad you're a pussy.
- You want some of this?

03:33.089 --> 03:35.122
I'll take some. I'll
take some more.

03:35.124 --> 03:37.391
- Who is this guy?
- Oh, you want some now?

03:37.393 --> 03:38.603
- You getting bored back there?
- Make a move.

03:38.605 --> 03:40.759
Is that all you got? 'Cause
I just took some of it.

03:40.841 --> 03:43.709
Your product works. I'm satisfied
with the field testing.

03:43.828 --> 03:44.960
So, what's our plan with it?

03:44.962 --> 03:47.129
How are we pushing this
out to the major markets?

03:47.131 --> 03:48.831
Where do we see this in five years?

03:49.239 --> 03:51.105
Well, look at Facebook and Twitter.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.598
We start off small,
like they did, see?

03:52.643 --> 03:55.026
And this goes [belches] huge, I know.

03:55.028 --> 03:56.193
We came up with this, right?

03:56.465 --> 03:59.133
Well, technically you
know, the Buddy Nugget is

03:59.135 --> 04:01.394
- not copyrighted yet, so I...
- Friendtourage.

04:01.627 --> 04:02.877
Now <i>that</i> our name.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.265
That doesn't involve buddies.

04:04.317 --> 04:06.317
That like one is more
important than all the rest.

04:06.319 --> 04:08.846
Yeah. I mean, not right
now, but I'm gonna be.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.148
I don't like that
name, man... no.

04:10.236 --> 04:11.408
Okay. Fair enough.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.810
How about the Self-Importanator!

04:13.861 --> 04:15.995
Look, I'll talk branding
with you later, okay?

04:16.009 --> 04:18.108
But first, I don't want
anybody to know about it.

04:18.118 --> 04:20.652
Nobody's gonna know...

04:21.822 --> 04:22.887
...yet.

04:24.299 --> 04:27.304
Damn it, Shake! You promise me,
you keeps this under wraps, man!

04:27.306 --> 04:28.773
This is not a premiere.

04:28.844 --> 04:32.478
It's a pre-pre-release to
generate a little buzz just to

04:32.562 --> 04:35.130
fool people into thinking
this ain't some hunk of crap.

04:35.152 --> 04:37.819
It isn't a hunk of... Flavor Flav?

04:37.962 --> 04:38.928
When does he perform?

04:38.978 --> 04:43.387
Perform? No, no, no.
He just appears.

04:43.599 --> 04:46.668
Performance is a whole other ball of wax.

04:46.962 --> 04:48.566
Okay. So, when does he arrive?

04:48.568 --> 04:49.901
That's the beauty of it.

04:49.961 --> 04:51.694
It's whenever he
damn well wants.

04:51.696 --> 04:54.504
And this lanyard's gonna
get me into the club?

04:54.506 --> 04:55.906
Plus two drink tickets!

04:56.004 --> 04:59.715
And access to the
bottomless cheese tray.

05:00.045 --> 05:01.278
- Oh yeah.
- There you go.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.043
That worked out.

05:02.053 --> 05:04.853
You go right on in there,
and you wait for Flav.

05:05.014 --> 05:07.582
There you go. That's what I'm
talking about! All right! Yeah!

05:07.584 --> 05:10.218
Shake, you ain't coming
in to get your cheese on?

05:10.220 --> 05:12.186
No, I'm uh, lactose intolerant.

05:12.188 --> 05:14.856
Weird, coming from a milkshake.

05:14.858 --> 05:17.959
No matter. V.I.P., bitches.

05:18.006 --> 05:19.473
No, no, no, no, no. See,
you don't understand.

05:19.512 --> 05:21.812
See, these are my drink tickets right here.

05:21.826 --> 05:23.358
I'm V.I.P. level!

05:23.373 --> 05:25.040
You know what that
stands for, right?

05:25.100 --> 05:28.035
Very Impotent Penis... Damn it, Shake!

05:28.493 --> 05:29.979
Look, yo. Bottomless cheese.

05:30.884 --> 05:32.951
Uh-oh. I hit rock bottom.

05:44.085 --> 05:46.553
Shake, I can see you.

05:46.570 --> 05:49.137
Shake, I see your
ass right there.

05:49.139 --> 05:52.773
Oh, hey! How's it
going Mr. V.I.P.?

05:52.833 --> 05:55.953
- Yeah. I read the lanyard.
- Penis, classic.

05:56.047 --> 05:57.609
Hey, cheese tray treating you right?

05:57.611 --> 05:58.977
Hey, you want a T-shirt?

05:58.979 --> 06:01.299
Hey, give my friend a
T-shirt here, will you?

06:01.618 --> 06:03.184
Stop with the damn t-shirts!

06:03.188 --> 06:04.855
What the hell's
going on over here?

06:04.857 --> 06:06.347
This is the real premiere party.

06:06.505 --> 06:08.204
I rented that dump next door

06:08.279 --> 06:10.480
just to siphon off all the nerds.

06:10.522 --> 06:13.389
Wait, we rented two clubs?
And a boat, yes.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.971
- Is that okay with you?
- No it's not.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.141
Look, calm down.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.510
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Here's two drink tickets.

06:19.539 --> 06:24.375
Don't tell anybody I gave them to you,
but go next door, and wait for Flav.

06:24.395 --> 06:26.428
And what does M.V.P. stand for, huh?

06:26.569 --> 06:29.036
There's, uh... there's different levels.
I don't know.

06:29.112 --> 06:30.845
Look, buddy, I'd let you in over

06:30.937 --> 06:33.938
here, but we're at capacity,
and the fire marshal is pretty

06:33.941 --> 06:36.145
strict because of all
the smoke machines.

06:36.147 --> 06:40.127
Anyways, text me later when
you guys are driving home!

06:41.486 --> 06:44.339
Fine! You think you can keep me out?
Not today, pal!

06:44.372 --> 06:46.905
'Cause guess who I've
got in my buddy basket?

06:49.281 --> 06:51.615
This weird scientist guy
who is afraid of sunlight!

06:51.707 --> 06:54.441
But apparently, we have a lot
of other things in common!

06:54.443 --> 06:57.891
- Dr. Balthazar.
- Dr. Balthazar.
I remember your name. Yeah.

06:57.893 --> 06:59.793
Well, do you remember
when I said this?

06:59.829 --> 07:03.197
"Together, we can dissolve the
planet, and everyone who ever

07:03.213 --> 07:07.945
betrayed me in gym class will feel
a pain unlike any sensation!"

07:07.951 --> 07:12.120
No! Please don't! Not in front
of the girls' basketball team!"

07:12.122 --> 07:15.691
Man, you seemed to be pretty down with
that, you know... dissolving those guys.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.791
Seemed really into it.

07:16.793 --> 07:19.994
You know, I tracked them down,
and I killed their pets.

07:19.996 --> 07:22.030
Then I never hear from you.

07:22.035 --> 07:25.603
Been busy with work, been
at the gym, trying to get back
in shape, stuff like that.

07:25.605 --> 07:28.647
Well, see, now you told me you didn't have a
job and that you didn't even like the gym.

07:28.693 --> 07:30.559
But I'm glad to see you're
growing as a person.

07:30.561 --> 07:33.395
I know. Look. Just please,
for right now, can

07:33.404 --> 07:35.175
you just use your metal teeth
to get me in this club?

07:35.177 --> 07:36.410
- Us, right? Get us?
- No, of course.

07:36.479 --> 07:38.746
Both of us. L-l-let's hang.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.916
To the boat!

07:50.446 --> 07:51.696
Shake?

07:51.697 --> 07:52.235
Shake?

07:52.284 --> 07:54.563
He's probably moving to the V.I.P. boat.

07:54.565 --> 07:56.431
Dude, you have a V.I.P. boat?

07:56.460 --> 07:59.051
- Oh, that's rad. Let's go.
- Oh, totally.

07:59.053 --> 08:00.729
I was gonna call you,
too, Dr. Balthazar.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.898
I totally forgot you moved
here to be closer to me.

08:07.392 --> 08:11.564
- We'll see a woman.
- Breakout the schnitzel.
'Cause it's a sausage fest.

08:11.649 --> 08:12.782
Free drinks, I'll bet.

08:12.797 --> 08:13.930
Let's go in and [farts] someone up.

08:14.001 --> 08:16.802
No, no, no. No one gets
in without one of these.

08:16.883 --> 08:18.215
And there's only one of these.

08:18.466 --> 08:21.447
See if my name is on the list. I'm
the one who created the damn thing.

08:21.449 --> 08:26.164
I'll do it, but there's only one name
on the list, and it ain't yours.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.131
See if my names on the list.
Meatwad, plus two.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.055
It may be under Dewy or Vanessa.

08:30.145 --> 08:33.275
Look, can you change people's, uh,
minds with your metal teeth?

08:33.368 --> 08:34.577
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.325
That's change.
He's a pudding.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.832
Okay. Here's your V.I.P. pass and some
drink tickets. See you on the boat.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.834
Guys, a little bit of a...
little bit of a roadblock.

08:45.836 --> 08:47.535
Thanks, man. I'll
e-mail you, okay?

08:47.621 --> 08:49.588

08:58.788 --> 09:02.397
The promenade deck is reserved for clients.
You're just the creator.

09:02.468 --> 09:04.468
Look, I created the [belches]
thing to give you a

09:04.550 --> 09:06.973
[belches] reason to have a [belches]
party in the [belches] first place!

09:06.997 --> 09:10.461
Flav cannot see a floating
box of fries at his party!

09:10.471 --> 09:12.471
He's gonna flip out and
hit you with his clock!

09:12.473 --> 09:14.342
- It ain't his party, Shake!
- It is now.

09:14.433 --> 09:17.434
He's got 25% interest
in the Flavor Saver.

09:17.531 --> 09:20.218
Flavor Saver? It's
the Buddy Nugget.

09:20.220 --> 09:23.421
- We didn't issue any stock!
- Well <i>you</i> didn't.

09:23.423 --> 09:26.958
- Hey, are you Flavor Flav?
- Oh, no. No, I'm not.

09:27.012 --> 09:28.478
Oh, okay. My bad.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.467
Wait, Flav! Come back!
It's totally cool!

09:30.558 --> 09:35.986
Hey, you're supposed to stay for 15
minutes minimum, mister! Please don't go!

09:36.136 --> 09:38.303
Well, I guess the
party is over, huh?

09:38.316 --> 09:40.293
Get enough buzz for
the nugget, huh?

09:40.295 --> 09:41.494
Oh, was that Flavor Flav?

09:41.998 --> 09:45.387
Or was it... was it the "chocolate rain" guy?
Either way, big fan of both.

09:45.638 --> 09:47.205
God I've got to get off this boat!

09:47.222 --> 09:49.186
Now that you're on it,
it's not even cool.

09:49.844 --> 09:54.179
Who put this pudding on the deck?
It's damn good.

09:54.266 --> 09:59.933
Look, I've thought a lot about it, and
you can have the Buddy Nugget, okay?

09:59.939 --> 10:01.539
You do whatever you want to do with it.

10:01.548 --> 10:04.014
Good, because I secured
the copyright.

10:04.101 --> 10:06.101
Checkmate. Winning!

10:07.905 --> 10:09.972
- Flav!
- Hey. What up, dawg?

10:10.065 --> 10:11.164
Wait. Wait. Hang on.

10:11.184 --> 10:14.114
Do I need to pay your appearance
fee to be here in my living room?

10:14.120 --> 10:17.192
No, no. It's cool.
We'll do a freebie on this one.

10:17.194 --> 10:18.293
Oh, good.

10:18.295 --> 10:24.574
Wait a minute. Clock radio.
You're not Flav at all, are you?

10:24.576 --> 10:26.140
Okay, you got me.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.342
I'm a celebrity impersonator.

10:28.344 --> 10:30.412
- Aw, man.
- Yo, don't be trippin'.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.857
- I look like Flav, I sound like Flav.
- You're white!

10:33.937 --> 10:37.506
I know that, but this is my
tribute to public enemy

10:37.508 --> 10:40.609
and their message of racial empowerment.

10:40.839 --> 10:42.714
Really? Black face?

10:42.716 --> 10:45.308
Well, yeah, if you're gonna say
it like that, it sounds bad.
