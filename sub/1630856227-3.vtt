00:02.000 --> 00:03.320
Mr Zaman is a Wudyani national.

00:03.320 --> 00:06.320
His aim was to disrupt the UK-Wudyani relationship.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.760
Jabhat Al'huriya wouldn't be the first allegedly peaceful group

00:10.760 --> 00:12.160
to start killing people.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.480
We have evidence that Anthony Chapman didn't pilot the rogue R-PAS.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.560
It was piloted from Wudyan.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.640
So, can you explain why he went into hiding? Not yet.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.000
Get down here now.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.480
Is there anything that you can tell me that's going to help me

00:25.480 --> 00:27.800
catch the man that did this to you and your dad?

00:29.360 --> 00:30.440
GUNSHOT

00:30.440 --> 00:32.640
I want to go back, I want to go back to Wudyan.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.040
Someone hired you to kill Anthony Chapman.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.400
Someone is trying to frame Chapman for a crime.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.880
Shut your mouth!

00:39.880 --> 00:42.680
The console was stolen while Chapman was in Dubai.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.760
What the hell?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.400
SABI: Why are you looking at him?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.240
Do you know him? No.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.160
Do you think someone on that base helped kill my dad?

00:50.160 --> 00:53.000
..What I want and it's not going to end well.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.680
Was any of what you told me true?

00:54.680 --> 00:57.280
Even if I knew what was going on, I probably couldn't tell you.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.560
There's a prisoner here

00:58.560 --> 01:01.400
who I believe has links to Jabhat Al'huriya.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.880
Remember the phone you recovered at the cottage?

01:06.880 --> 01:09.280
It's not Chapman's, it's Sabi's.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.560
Where's Sabi now?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.320
I need to find her.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.680
What are you doing, Sabi?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.840
KNIFE SLASHES SKIN

01:13.680 --> 01:15.840
Hey! Drop it!

01:15.840 --> 01:17.400
Let me go! Drop it!

01:18.680 --> 01:20.080
HE GRUNTS

01:24.320 --> 01:26.240
Sabi. Sabi, listen to me.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.440
Sabi...

01:27.440 --> 01:29.360
Stop! Don't come any closer.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.720
Put the knife down.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.760
You don't want to make this worse than it already is.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.800
I can't feel my arm.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.600
He did this. He made me do it!

01:37.600 --> 01:38.880
Sabi...

01:40.280 --> 01:41.880
..you need to give me the knife.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.160
Look at him. He needs help.

01:53.560 --> 01:54.800
Give me the knife.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.040
I didn't...

02:12.880 --> 02:14.120
What did you do?

02:15.440 --> 02:16.760
What did you do?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.200
He didn't do anything to you and you tried to kill him!

02:20.200 --> 02:21.440
Hey! HEY!

02:21.440 --> 02:24.280
It's his fault my dad's dead! All of this is his fault!

02:39.440 --> 02:43.200
# Do you want me on your mind

02:43.200 --> 02:48.280
# Or do you want me to go on?

02:51.640 --> 02:57.640
# I might be yours As sure as I can say

02:57.640 --> 03:02.520
# Be gone, be far away

03:04.600 --> 03:09.960

03:12.520 --> 03:16.560

Hi, love, you all right?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.960

03:28.960 --> 03:31.000
Sabi Chapman stabbed Callum Barker.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
CAR APPROACHES

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Oh, shit.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.240
Have you got anything back from digital forensics about her phone?

03:37.240 --> 03:38.880
I mean, they're fast-tracking it.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.240
They said it won't be long.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
OK, thanks. Erm...

03:44.680 --> 03:46.680
God, I'm so sorry, I've got to go.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.120
Love you.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.440
Let's go.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.560
Right, I want a lookout request on Ross Sutherland.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.720
Let's get a picture of him sent around today.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.800
I want every patrol car to know what he looks like.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.320
He's to be considered armed and dangerous.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.360
Let's find him before he hurts anybody else.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.600
Surgeons think there could be nerve damage.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.880
He may never pilot again.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.560
I knew it was a bad idea bringing Sabi back here.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.080
I need to find a way to keep this squadron together.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.000
You need to find out how this happened and fast.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.760
OK, I'll speak to Sabi.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.120
Look, I'm going to need someone to send me all available CCTV footage

04:38.120 --> 04:42.560
from around the base, at the time the R-PAS console was taken.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.320
Now. No delays.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.480
I've just come from watching Flight Lieutenant Barker

05:04.480 --> 05:05.920
being prepped for surgery.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.920
Do you want to tell me why you attacked him?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.240
You said that he made you do something.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.840
What was that?

05:18.840 --> 05:21.240
Did you steal the R-PAS console?

05:21.240 --> 05:24.400
Sabi, what are you involved in?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.320
PHONE RINGS

05:32.600 --> 05:34.960
I... I've got to take this.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.280
But you want to think about giving me some answers,

05:37.280 --> 05:41.000
cos this doesn't go away, it only gets worse.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.840
PHONE CONTINUES RINGING, KNOCKS ON DOOR

05:47.320 --> 05:49.080
Hey. KIRSTEN: I've got something.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.960
Sabi Chapman was messaging somebody who's not in her contacts.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
Does she mention the R-PAS console?

05:54.960 --> 05:57.400
It feels pretty safe to assume so.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.680
OK, so, this is Sabi from last Thursday.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.840
Now, she says, "Can't you do it?

06:04.840 --> 06:07.280
"I don't see why you need my help."

06:07.280 --> 06:10.000
And then they say to her,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.480
"We told you, you're the only one who can."

06:13.480 --> 06:15.280
And then later, she messages them

06:15.280 --> 06:20.080
right after the R-PAS console was taken...and says,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.760
"It's done, I left it where you told me."

06:22.760 --> 06:24.840
I mean, they don't reply to her there.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.160
She tries to get in touch with them again, but nothing.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.880
Does she mention whoever it was by name?

06:29.880 --> 06:31.160
No.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.480
No, no names.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.520
I'm wondering about Callum Barker. MESSAGE TONE

06:36.520 --> 06:38.880
Are you thinking this is why she stabbed him?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.280
I don't know.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.760
Erm, I'll call you back.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.480
You'll be in trouble if you don't.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.360
You've got, like, special MI5 search engines for people, right?

06:53.360 --> 06:55.840
Oh, we're checking people out all the time.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.200
Nothing better to do than spying on your Facebook.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.920
SHE SNICKERS

06:59.920 --> 07:02.120
I'll get some of the basement guys on it. What do you need?

07:02.120 --> 07:05.240
Amy said Sabi Chapman stabbed Flight Lieutenant Callum Barker.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.800
No clear motive.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.680
I want to find out everything about him,

07:08.680 --> 07:10.360
see if there's something we need to know.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.680
I'll get them on it.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.200
SHE SIGHS

07:21.920 --> 07:23.880
CELL DOOR CLOSES

07:28.480 --> 07:31.600
So who have you messaged on your phone in the last week?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.800
I told you, I don't have one.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.120
We found it, Sabi.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.480
And we've read your messages.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.800
You asked them why they needed your help.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.520
Stealing from an air base, that's quite a big ask.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.800
Why did you take the R-PAS console?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.120
I didn't.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.520
Your dad deleted the footage from the security cameras in the armoury.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.680
He didn't get to other cameras on the base.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.160
Look at that.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.920
This is ten minutes after the console was taken.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.360
What's in that bag?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.520
What's in the bag?!

08:04.720 --> 08:07.840
You leave the base with the bag...

08:09.600 --> 08:13.400
..and then you return half an hour later and the bag's gone.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.880
Who picked that up? Jabhat Al'huriya or Callum?

08:17.840 --> 08:19.200
I don't know.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.080
Why are you protecting them?

08:25.440 --> 08:28.520
After you've given them the console, the messages just stop.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.680
They've got what they wanted and you're,

08:31.680 --> 08:34.160
you're the one who's in custody.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.480
Oh, for God's sake, Sabi! People have died.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.720
If you and your dad... Dad had nothing to do with it.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.920
Why should I believe that?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.160
Because you've done nothing but lie to me the whole time.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.360
I was trying to help.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.760
A terrorist group?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.200
The people who live here.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.840
My mum was from here.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.640
He said she would have wanted me to help them.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.280
Callum said that?

08:52.280 --> 08:55.360
People are being locked up here for things they didn't do.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.560
They're being killed.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.040
He said I could help,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.400
if I got the console for Jabhat Al'huriya.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.880
And why couldn't Callum get the console himself?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.360
He didn't have clearance to get into the armoury.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.440
And that's why they needed you, for your dad's pass?

09:12.440 --> 09:13.760
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.280
And then your dad found out what happened and that's why you left?

09:20.240 --> 09:22.960
You think that's why they killed him, cos he knew?

09:25.360 --> 09:30.760
Right before we left, I saw them fighting, my dad and Callum.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.240
My dad was so upset with him.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.920
That's when I knew it must be Callum.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.240
I came back because I wanted to talk to him,

09:39.240 --> 09:41.520
but he acted like I didn't even exist.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.240
I only took it because I thought I was doing the right thing.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.440
I didn't want anybody to die.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.520
SOBBING: But my dad...

09:59.760 --> 10:01.320
They killed my dad.

Yeah. OK?

12:58.600 --> 12:59.680
Yeah.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.960

13:02.960 --> 13:06.800
Oh, er, to say hello to. Not well.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.160
She's the boss' kid.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.000
She was.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.000
Were you and Chapman friendly?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.720
Friendly enough, why?

13:16.720 --> 13:21.000
Did you ever message her? Er, text her, or anything like that?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.640
No. I don't have her number.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.960
What am I going to be texting her about anyway?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.920
I've reason to believe that Sabi was coerced into stealing

13:30.920 --> 13:33.640
the R-PAS console that carried out the attack at Dundair...

13:33.640 --> 13:34.960
Hang on...

13:34.960 --> 13:38.480
..and whoever coerced her was working with Jabhat Al'huriya.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.640
And you think that was me?

13:52.680 --> 13:54.040
You recognise this?

13:56.200 --> 13:59.120
Do you want to tell me why you've got a secret mobile phone?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.160
I don't know anything about it.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.640
Well, I could send that back to the UK

14:04.640 --> 14:06.880
and get Digital Forensics to unlock it for me.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.200
Or you could give me the PIN and save us both some time.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.000
I didn't message her anything.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.840
What were you arguing with Chapman about before he left?

14:17.760 --> 14:19.280
Who told you that?

14:19.280 --> 14:21.000
What did you argue about?

14:22.040 --> 14:23.240
Nothing.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.680
He was, erm...

14:25.840 --> 14:27.840
We, we didn't argue about anything.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.360
I can't remember.

14:36.480 --> 14:41.640
Did 109 Squadron take part in the mission at Al Bidbiyat?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.240
I'm not at liberty to talk about that.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.840
Were you piloting that day?

14:52.120 --> 14:53.880
It must have been horrendous.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.440
19 people blown up on their way home, 12 of them children.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.760
And the press said it was, erm,

15:01.760 --> 15:04.000
an error of intelligence, is that right?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.280
Mm-hm.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.600
That's the kind of tragedy that would turn someone against

15:07.600 --> 15:09.840
their own. No. Against their squadron.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.520
I would never...

15:13.560 --> 15:16.000
I told you, I can't talk about that.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.880

15:36.400 --> 15:38.840
..but I think he's got reason to push back against this place...

15:38.840 --> 15:40.160
No, Amy, hang on...

15:40.160 --> 15:44.920
I have got someone who would like to say hello.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.000
VIDEOCALL BLEEPS

15:49.000 --> 15:52.160
Oh, my God! Hey!

15:53.440 --> 15:55.840
Hey, buddy!

15:55.840 --> 15:57.120
SHE CHUCKLES

15:58.320 --> 16:00.680
Oh, my God! Is that his arm? Aye.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.920
Oh, my God, he's sucking his thumb.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.200
Hey...

16:13.200 --> 16:14.960
why are you in hospital?

16:14.960 --> 16:16.520
Erm...

16:16.520 --> 16:18.200
Is something wrong?

16:18.200 --> 16:20.240
Er, no, no.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.280
WHISPERS: Oh, thank you.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.640
I've just had some cramping, that's all.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.000
And you didn't call me?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.680
Well, I didn't want to worry you.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.240
You know, like, the doctor said, she doesn't know what it was,

16:32.240 --> 16:33.560
but we're fine.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.360
I googled it in the taxi

16:36.360 --> 16:40.360
and I thought I might have an irritable uterus.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.080
That makes sense. I mean, why should your uterus be any different

16:44.080 --> 16:46.320
to the rest of you? Ah! All right!

16:46.320 --> 16:48.680
I'm just relieved you're both OK.

16:48.680 --> 16:52.280
Aye, me too. Fit as a fiddle.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.520
WHISPERS: Thank you.

16:55.520 --> 16:59.000
But, erm, I'm sorry, you were saying, back to your work stuff.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.400
Uh...

17:00.400 --> 17:04.120
Right, I was, erm... I was going to ask about Sutherland.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.040
Did you get anywhere with his past addresses?

17:06.040 --> 17:08.960
I wanted, actually, to speak to you about this last night,

17:08.960 --> 17:11.160
but you had enough going on.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.400
Erm...we found him, yeah.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.960
We found him at his old flat. He was hiding out.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.720
And did you arrest him?

17:19.720 --> 17:21.480
No.

17:21.480 --> 17:25.160
No. I was alone...and he escaped.

17:25.160 --> 17:28.760
What? What happened? Did he... Did he hurt you?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.120
No, he didn't hurt me.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.680
I mean, he just, you know, he just spooked me.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.080
But I'm fine.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.280
Well, you're not fine, you're in hospital.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.080
Aye, but we don't know that caused it.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.800
And we don't know that it didn't either.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.440
I mean, it's not like you've not been pushing yourself, taking risks.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.880
You ended up alone with a murderer.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.200
I didn't exactly choose to be.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.080
You've got Townsend to do that stuff.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.400
Of course. You would rather I was just sitting at my desk.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.280
What are you trying to prove doing all of this?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.840
I'm not trying to prove anything!

17:53.840 --> 17:56.960
Is this concern coming from Senior Investigating Officer Amy,

17:56.960 --> 17:58.400
or mother of my child Amy?

17:58.400 --> 17:59.600
Erm, both.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.200
Oh, whatever.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.600
You know, I just wanted you to see him.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.600
I'll call you later.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
Kirst...

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
PHONE GOES DEAD

18:10.800 --> 18:12.400
SIGHS

18:10.800 --> 18:12.400
Shit.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.360
Where are we on Sutherland?

18:26.360 --> 18:29.360
Er, Ross Sutherland.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.960
Did two tours of Afghanistan,

18:31.960 --> 18:34.640
dismissed with disgrace after the second.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.200
What happened?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.760
Er, it's not in the file, but we can try and find out.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.320
After that, he came back here, did a few different jobs,

18:41.320 --> 18:42.720
lived in a few different places.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.560
I've got officers with armed backup going to any known

18:45.560 --> 18:49.200
residences, areas he frequented, checking in on known associates.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.240
He was arrested a few times.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.200
I've requisitioned the interview tapes,

18:53.200 --> 18:56.560
see if there's anything on them that might help. Great.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.600
Techs have got back to me about Callum Barker.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.160
Look at this.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.880
Top level, everything appears to be above board.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.200
Basketball, banter.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.480
However, they matched his IP to another account,

19:10.480 --> 19:12.040
which is anonymous.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.600
And here are some messages about imprisoning people

19:16.600 --> 19:20.600
protesting for free speech, LGBTQ laws.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.560
Nothing he says himself, it all appears to be boosting.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.280
Ah. There's one about military intrusions in The Middle East.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.640
Yeah.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.360
Can you send all that over to DCI Silva?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.880
You don't want to tell her yourself?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.120
No, she's busy.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.440
Be better if she gets that as soon as possible, OK?

19:39.560 --> 19:40.960
You got me a decaf.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.040
Yeah.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.920
Because of your...

19:46.920 --> 19:48.120
..condition.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.760
My condition is that I had a terrible night.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.280
I've got a very long day ahead of me

19:55.280 --> 19:57.000
and so I'd appreciate some caffeine.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.320
I'll get it, I'll get it... No, it's too late, I've got it.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.760
SHE SCOFFS

20:01.760 --> 20:02.880
Thank you.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.480
I don't have to talk to you.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.600
You'd be advised to.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.360
You've got me locked in here,

20:09.360 --> 20:11.240
as if I'm going to do a runner or something.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.000
My team just sent me a link to one of your social media accounts.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
There's some pretty contentious opinions on there.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I'm allowed to think what I think.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.200
You started that account a few weeks after the attack at Al Bidbiyat.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.040
Is that a coincidence?

20:25.040 --> 20:29.000
Just cos I work here doesn't mean I have to like everything we do.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I didn't do any of this.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.560
Any of what you're saying.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.600
What am I saying?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.600
HE SCOFFS

20:35.640 --> 20:37.520
I looked at your personnel file.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.760
You take the third Thursday night of every month off-base.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.080
Where do you go?

20:43.240 --> 20:44.920
Nowhere. Around.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.480
What about last Thursday?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.600
I can't remember.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.200
Last Thursday was when Sabi stole the R-PAS device

20:50.200 --> 20:52.280
and she left it to be collected by somebody

20:52.280 --> 20:53.640
and whoever that person was,

20:53.640 --> 20:55.800
took it and gave it to Jabhat Al'huriya.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.360
So if you've got nothing to hide,

20:57.360 --> 21:00.400
I suggest you think hard about where you were last Thursday.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
If you want to formally accuse me of something,

21:02.400 --> 21:04.040
we can get a lawyer in here,

21:04.040 --> 21:06.080
but I'm not saying a word otherwise.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.960
I'm tired. I'd like you to leave.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.080
Hi. What can I get for you?

21:20.080 --> 21:22.400
Erm, flat white, please.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.000
Decaf.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.120
MESSAGE TONE

21:32.120 --> 21:33.160
Thank you.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.640
Outside. Don't say a word.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.120
Turn around...slowly.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.240
What are you doing?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.520
I ask the questions.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.480
I ask the questions, OK? Just, just...

22:14.960 --> 22:16.560
You told me someone framed him.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.880
Because they did.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.560
Chapman had nothing to with Dundair.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.280
The attack was carried out from Wudyan.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.720
No.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.040
No, we have definitive proof that the R-PAS was being

22:31.040 --> 22:35.040
controlled by somebody in Wudyan. I mean, it wasn't Chapman.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.840
They framed him and they're setting you up as a scapegoat.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.400
OK...

22:43.920 --> 22:46.360
I did what I had to do to keep people safe, OK?

22:46.360 --> 22:48.560
OK? That's all.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.320
Chapman was a threat.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.360
Anthony Chapman was just a man.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.960
He was just trying to serve.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.240
Is that what you're trying to do?

22:57.240 --> 22:58.840
Don't fucking look at them.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:07.240 --> 23:13.040
Whoever convinced you to do this, OK, they have used you.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.440
If you can just, just tell me who that is.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.360
Let me help you.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.960
Fuck!

23:36.640 --> 23:39.000
I thought that doing this would make it better.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.800
It didn't.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.440
I can't make it better, can I?

23:57.800 --> 24:00.680
SHE EXHALES

24:03.520 --> 24:05.320
SIGHS

24:08.240 --> 24:10.080
BANG ON DOOR

24:12.200 --> 24:13.560
Oh, no, no, no, no.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.000
Whatever this is, I don't want it.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.280
I need to talk to you about the R-PAS console.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.680
I already went through this with you after the event.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.360
Yeah, you did. I need you to go over it again.

24:22.360 --> 24:27.600
The latency of Alpha R-PAS puts the console here, nowhere near Dundair.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.080
Yeah.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.880
The GPS said it's in Scotland, but you can mask that.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.560
Look.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.920
Latency suggests that...

24:39.200 --> 24:42.640
..that it is within a limited radius of Al-Shawka.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.760
A little over 20 miles.

24:44.760 --> 24:45.880
Bahrat Wud.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.720
That's where they did the operation yesterday.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.240
It's in the circle.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.440
Yeah, looks like it.

24:50.440 --> 24:54.320
How long would it take to teach someone how to operate the R-PAS?

24:54.320 --> 24:58.600
To become an expert? That's a lot of man-hours.

24:58.600 --> 25:02.200
But to learn enough to be made something go boom?

25:02.200 --> 25:04.000
It's not long at all.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.840
Uh, you're welcome.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.440
I just thought I should let you know that I'm managing it.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.760
You're managing your people being attacked?

25:12.760 --> 25:15.400
I've informed Air Marshal Grainger that his presence would be

25:15.400 --> 25:17.680
keenly felt here at the moment. He's coming here?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.360
KNOCK AT DOOR

25:19.360 --> 25:21.160
Erm, Colonel.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.000
I wanted to talk to you... Can it wait?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.560
I'd like to hear what the detective has to say.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.040
It's about the stolen R-PAS console.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.160
I have reason to believe it's been taken off-base.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.960
Wes Harper showed me the limits of where it might have been taken

25:32.960 --> 25:35.160
and Bahrat Wud is in that area.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.920
I'd like to take a look at the safe house.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.280
My soldiers have already gone over it.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.560
If there was anything to find, we would have found it.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.160
I'd really like to look myself.

25:44.160 --> 25:48.040
I'm sure DCI Silva just has boxes she needs to tick.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.680
Flight Lieutenant Lawson's heading up there shortly.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.840
You can go with her.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.640
Also, I've been in touch with the local police,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.040
in preparation of handing Sabiha Chapman to them.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.880
She's a UK citizen. She's as Wudyani as she is British.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.360
And hers was a crime that she committed on Wudyani soil.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.960
So when you're finished with her, I will be taking her off your hands.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.280
Anything else?

26:24.080 --> 26:25.720
You're with me.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.720
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

26:49.720 --> 26:51.200
Nothing's stopping you.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.360
How do you get on with Flight Lieutenant Barker?

26:57.360 --> 26:58.920
Fine.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.400
Huh? Fine.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.560
Are you friends?

27:04.560 --> 27:06.800
I respect him, he's a good pilot.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.480
That's not the same.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.680
You don't like talking to me.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.240
Doesn't matter what I like.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.800
No, actually, I like knowing what's going on.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.880
You came here, Sabi went nuts, now Barker's locked up.

27:49.880 --> 27:53.280
Look, I'm just trying to get answers myself, and then...

27:54.480 --> 27:57.440
..I can get you all back to some sort of normality.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.880
Hmm.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.680
Normality.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.120
Do you know where Callum goes on his downtime, when he's off-base?

28:06.120 --> 28:07.440
No idea.

28:07.440 --> 28:11.400
Rest of us do whatever - the beach or the malls or...

28:11.400 --> 28:13.000
Whatever.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.560
He doesn't come with us.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.400
What transport do you use?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.040
You're sitting in it.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.320
We each take turns with it on our days off.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.240
We can do whatever we like with it.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.920
Yeah? Do you recognise any of these?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.680
That's an outlet mall.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.280
That's a hotel. They're pretty lax with the booze rules.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.960
And this one?

28:33.960 --> 28:35.280
No idea. Not one of mine.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.480
Callum's?

28:36.480 --> 28:37.960
You'd better ask him.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.880
Right, it's go time.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.360
I need to look around inside.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.920
Yeah, that's not a given.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.800
Wudyanis have to sign off on it.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.800
Wait here until I give you the all-clear.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.320
THEY CHAT INDISTINCTLY

30:27.920 --> 30:30.200
PLASTIC CLATTERS

30:33.480 --> 30:35.520
CLATTERING CONTINUES

30:39.040 --> 30:40.680
FOOT RUSTLES ON FLOOR

30:40.680 --> 30:42.320
CLATTERING STOPS

30:46.880 --> 30:48.960
HE PANTS

30:48.960 --> 30:51.200
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

30:55.160 --> 30:56.920
OK.

31:01.240 --> 31:02.520
THUD

31:02.520 --> 31:03.880
Ah!

31:13.560 --> 31:15.880
SHE GRUNTS

31:19.520 --> 31:22.040
You could have been killed.

31:22.040 --> 31:25.520
What were you thinking, coming in here alone?

31:25.520 --> 31:27.560
I needed to look for the console,

31:27.560 --> 31:30.480
and if there was a chance the Wudyanis wouldn't let me, then...

31:39.800 --> 31:41.520
Did you get a decent look at him?

31:41.520 --> 31:42.680
Er, yeah.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.320
Was this him?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.080
Faisal Ghazali? Yeah.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.360
Yeah, he was...

31:55.360 --> 31:57.360
Have you got anything sharp?

32:12.480 --> 32:13.920
What is that?

32:16.640 --> 32:17.960
A map.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.200
Erm...

32:24.080 --> 32:25.680
This'll need translating.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.000
I should get these back to base.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.160
Hey, you know the address on the car's sat nav?

32:36.160 --> 32:37.960
Could you take me there?

32:37.960 --> 32:39.680
Another time.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.000
If it's a place of interest, we need to check it out...

32:42.000 --> 32:43.720
Yeah, we haven't got time.

32:43.720 --> 32:47.800
You said you wanted answers and this is how we get them.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.520
OK. But you're not going alone.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.960
I'll give you a shout if I need you.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.640
BUZZER

33:19.640 --> 33:21.720
Hi, it's Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.240
I'm working with the British Air Force here at Al-Shawka.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.760
I wondered if I could come in and ask you a few questions.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.200
DOOR BUZZES

33:31.760 --> 33:33.320
Hi.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.560
Hi.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.560
Thank you.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.040
I didn't get your name.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.040
You want to take a seat?

33:47.040 --> 33:48.120
Thanks.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.920
I'm Nader...Waheed.

33:55.160 --> 33:58.760
Sorry, I don't wish to sound rude, but, er, why are you here?

33:58.760 --> 34:01.160
Oh, I'm investigating one of the pilots.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.560
It's just a routine check.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.160
He says he stays here sometimes?

34:04.160 --> 34:06.000
What's Sam done now, huh?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.560
Sam.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.440
How do you know Captain Kader?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.440
We studied at university together.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.600
Politics?

34:15.600 --> 34:17.200
Yeah, I stayed longer than him.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.000
He always said he wasn't "book-learning material".

34:20.000 --> 34:22.320
And would you say you're still political now.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.320
Why is that relevant?

34:29.080 --> 34:31.960
I'm not actually here to talk about Sam Kader.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.520
I'm here to ask about Callum Barker.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.880
You need to leave.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.600
Look, if they've engaged in some kind of criminal activity here...

34:40.600 --> 34:42.120
Unless you have a warrant...

34:42.120 --> 34:45.080
You could be implicated if you cover up for them.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.640
I told you - get out of my house.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.480
Can you find Captain Kader for me, bring him here?

35:04.880 --> 35:07.040
I told you - I don't want to talk to you again.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.680
I met Nader Waheed today.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.760
He's a friend, that's not a crime... Is that where Jabhat Al'huriya meet?

35:12.760 --> 35:14.000
Please don't do this.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.680
Did Kader take you there, tell you what they do?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.040
And after Al Bidbiyat,

35:18.040 --> 35:20.440
you were ready to believe anything they had to tell you.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.040
The same things that you told Sabiha?

35:22.040 --> 35:23.920
That they were your friends, that, that they

35:23.920 --> 35:26.560
were just trying to help people... I didn't say anything to Sabi...

35:26.560 --> 35:29.120
And then Chapman finds out that you were grooming his daughter.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.480
No! I swear, that's not what we were arguing about.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.200
It's nothing to do with Sabi.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.760
They were arguing about me.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.240
Don't do it.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.760
Callum and I have been together for the past year.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.280
So why didn't you say anything?

35:53.040 --> 35:54.440
He'd have been locked up.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.600
I didn't text Sabi.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.520
I didn't steal the R-PAS console,

36:00.520 --> 36:03.480
I certainly don't work for Jabhat Al'huriya.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.280
We went to Nader's house...

36:08.280 --> 36:10.320
..cos that's where we can be together.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.080
It's the only place we can be ourselves.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.600
Nader's discrete.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.720
The R-PAS was taken last Thursday.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.320
Were you at Nader's then?

36:22.320 --> 36:23.760
Yes.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.680
We were both there!

36:25.680 --> 36:27.360
Can Nader confirm this?

36:27.360 --> 36:29.920
He was in the house, he was on a video call most of the night,

36:29.920 --> 36:31.680
but, yes, he was there.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.000
And the phone that I found in your room...

36:36.040 --> 36:38.040
Is that just so you can talk to one another?

36:38.040 --> 36:40.480
I can give you the PIN, you can see for yourself.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.680
And the argument with Chapman?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.560
He knew about us.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.840
Before he left, he told me that we had to stop.

36:49.840 --> 36:55.160
He was covering for us, but once he'd left, he said it was dangerous.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.280
You can't understand what it's like,

36:57.280 --> 36:59.200
not being able to live your life.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.040
You can't tell them.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.480
Tell them about me, if you have to, but not Sam.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.760
Please.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.480
I'll do what I can.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.640
Thank you.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.680
If I'm free to go, I have a briefing to attend.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.200
What's happening?

37:33.200 --> 37:34.680
I know as much as you.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.960
I'll come back when I'm done.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.440
Yeah, OK.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.040
SHE SIGHS

37:51.320 --> 37:52.600
Aye, I'm going to be.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.000
OK, thank you.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.760
There's no sign of Sutherland anywhere.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.560
That guy really knows how to disappear.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.960
He's a regular bloody Houdini.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.760
I've been watching these interviews with him.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.480
PHONE BUZZES

38:00.760 --> 38:02.480
Throughout all of them,

38:02.480 --> 38:04.520
he's not angry, he's not violent, not really.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.680
He's messed up.

38:05.680 --> 38:08.200
He got diagnosed with PTSD, but that was way after he left the Forces.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.320
Did you find out why he was discharged?

38:10.320 --> 38:11.640
Yeah.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.120
Yeah, he was in Afghanistan.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.560
One of his squad-mates gets injured, he can't run,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.360
he's captured by whoever it is they were trying to take out.

38:18.360 --> 38:21.360
Sutherland is then ordered to evacuate and leave the man

38:21.360 --> 38:25.000
behind, but he knows by doing that, his mate's going to get tortured.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.800
So he decides to take a shot.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.880
Not at the target, though.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.400
At his mate.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.000
He murdered him?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.880
You got the video, right?

38:34.880 --> 38:36.760
PRESSES PLAY

38:36.760 --> 38:38.240
And...

38:38.240 --> 38:40.480
..yeah...

38:40.480 --> 38:44.040
..I loved Len, we were brothers, but he was hurt...

38:45.440 --> 38:47.000
..and he was going to die...

38:48.360 --> 38:51.320
..and I knew that they were going to hurt him more,

38:51.320 --> 38:53.560
and they were going to come for the rest of us.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.520
And I just... I thought I could protect us...

38:58.920 --> 39:00.360
..and him, all of us.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.280
I just want to go home.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.800
Can I... Can I go home now?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.680
Almost makes you feel sorry for the guy.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.000
Where was he living at the time?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.440
A charity halfway house.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.600
We checked it earlier.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.200
He calls it home.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.760
I'd like to check it out again,

39:23.760 --> 39:26.800
see if anybody there has any idea of where he might have gone.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.680
Hey, er, listen, I'm trying to put this delicately here.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.280
You went through a hell of a lot in the last couple of hours.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.640
It's completely fine if you sit this one out

39:35.640 --> 39:38.080
and let the local team check it out.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.360
It's fine, OK? Honestly.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.800
We'll bring backup.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.440
All right. Let's get to it, then.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.200
Callum's going to be fine.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.600
You missed the nerves and the arteries.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.600
Callum...

40:06.200 --> 40:08.400
..never actually give you his name, did he?

40:09.520 --> 40:13.240
No, but I knew it was him.

40:15.400 --> 40:19.760
Sabi... When we first came here, he spoke to me about my mum.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.640
His mum had died, he got it.

40:22.640 --> 40:26.280
And then in the messages, he said how proud she would be of me

40:26.280 --> 40:27.600
helping the people here.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.800
He knew what it was like.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.440
They used you, Sabi.

40:32.440 --> 40:33.720
No.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.760
No, it was him, he understood me.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.520
It wasn't him.

40:47.440 --> 40:50.480
It has to be someone else on this base.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.080
Have you got any idea who that might be?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.120
Can you take me back?

41:01.480 --> 41:04.520
Erm, I... I don't think I can do that.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.360
WHIMPERS

41:06.360 --> 41:09.200
You're not going to leave me here, though, are you?

41:09.200 --> 41:12.360
Don't...don't let them take me, please.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.360
They execute people here. Please.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.160
She's a police officer.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.640
She's not going to say anything.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.000
Somebody will, eventually.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.600
You're scared.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.640
Of course I am.

41:30.640 --> 41:33.560
We always knew this could happen.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.960
We did, did we?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.480
Don't be like this.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.960
What do you want me to be like?

41:39.000 --> 41:43.880
I would rather that you understood what I feel about you.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.240
Another time, another place...

41:49.240 --> 41:51.040
Don't. Please, don't.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.240
Don't, stay, stay, stay...

41:58.240 --> 42:00.520
I'm going to go off-base for a while.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.200
It's better this way.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.120
Lawyers.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.400
Keeping me on hold like they charge by the bloody hour.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.800
I didn't know you were coming.

42:33.800 --> 42:34.960
I wasn't.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.800
Until Sabi Chapman stabbed one of my men.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.560
Sabi Chapman was groomed.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.880
Manipulated.

42:40.880 --> 42:42.440
She's going to be a key witness.

42:42.440 --> 42:43.800
I can't have her locked up here.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.920
She committed a crime on Wudyani soil, it's out of my hands.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.440
She's a UK citizen.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.840
She needs to be tried in the UK.

42:49.840 --> 42:54.280
Apart from Firas Zaman, she's our only link to a group

42:54.280 --> 42:57.160
that committed a terrorist act on UK soil.

42:57.160 --> 42:59.640
I think that's worth something.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.800
I'll speak to Bilali.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.680
Make arrangements to get Sabi Chapman

43:06.680 --> 43:08.280
on the next flight to the UK.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.560
Yes, Sir.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.920
Thank you.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.920
They're in air as we speak.

43:12.920 --> 43:16.160
We've had intel that Abdullah Ghazali is on-site.

43:16.160 --> 43:20.320
Squadron Leader Russell will make contact before we engage.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.920
Ghazali?

43:21.920 --> 43:25.360
It was Faisal Ghazali who I found at the safe house.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.120
That's need-to-know information.

43:29.120 --> 43:31.120
Well, if he's involved in your mission,

43:31.120 --> 43:33.240
then I think I very much need to know it.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.040
WOMAN OVER INTERCOM: Delta Two One to Mission Command, holding angle.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.440
Is that Abdullah Ghazali?

44:02.440 --> 44:03.680
We think so.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.560
What's he got to do with this?

44:05.560 --> 44:08.880
Prior to today, Ghazali was only a smudge of data.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.480
He was vocal about his distaste for the current regime,

44:11.480 --> 44:14.080
but until you found his son and those documents,

44:14.080 --> 44:17.720
we didn't have anything tangible to connect him to Jabhat Al'huriya.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.480
He appears to be their leader.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.200
Have you got my positive ID?

44:23.200 --> 44:24.760
No ID match yet.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.760
DOOR OPENS

44:26.760 --> 44:30.120
Colonel. I thought you were monitoring this remotely?

44:30.120 --> 44:32.240
I wanted to see the joint squadron at work.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.760
This is an important operation for us all.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.480
WOMAN OVER INTERCOM: Vehicle approaching from northern road.

44:52.360 --> 44:53.960
Where's my PID?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.680
Trying to get a match, Ma'am, his face is too obscured.

45:00.320 --> 45:01.680
What are they doing?

45:01.680 --> 45:04.280
We knew through Wudyani Intelligence that rebel

45:04.280 --> 45:06.800
forces across the border were preparing to move arms.

45:06.800 --> 45:10.080
What we didn't have confirmation on was when and to who.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.240
The information recovered by you

45:12.240 --> 45:15.880
and Flight Lieutenant Lawson at the safe house gave us that knowledge.

45:15.880 --> 45:20.880
If we can stop Ghazali, we stop Jabhat Al'huriya from operating.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.360
You're going to take him out?

45:22.360 --> 45:24.120
That man's a key witness.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.840
He's a terrorist.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.960
I thought the R-PAS was only used for surveillance in Wudyan.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.880
We're across the border.

45:30.880 --> 45:32.760
This operation isn't in Wudyan.

45:32.760 --> 45:36.280
We have different protocols for situations outside of our country.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.560
Is that what happened in Al Bidbiyat?

45:38.560 --> 45:41.800
12 children using British weapons?

45:41.800 --> 45:44.320
That's not a mission I'm at liberty to discuss,

45:44.320 --> 45:46.200
nor is it relevant to your case.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.760
The estimate holds.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.200
What's the estimate?

45:52.200 --> 45:56.680
It's fallout. Loss of life, damage to property...

45:56.680 --> 45:58.480
So it's collateral damage.

45:58.480 --> 46:01.240
We don't use those terms.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.880
But you are working out how many civilians it's acceptable

46:03.880 --> 46:07.320
for you to kill. This...is how warfare works.

46:07.320 --> 46:10.320
This is how we keep people safe.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.000
That's it. Grab that.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.880
Have we got a positive ID?

46:22.880 --> 46:25.320
Abdullah Ghazali, ident confirmed.

46:25.320 --> 46:26.680
Are we within the estimate?

46:26.680 --> 46:28.240
Affirmative.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.840
Delta 2-1, target's all yours.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.920
Delta 2-1, hold fire.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.000
ON RADIO: Children near the target.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.120
Are we still within the estimate?

46:52.120 --> 46:53.800
We're outside.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.440
Let me know as soon as we're back.

46:56.440 --> 46:57.960
WHISPERS: Come on.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.000
Delta 2-1, stand by for weapons free.

47:22.600 --> 47:23.960
Someone's warned him.

47:23.960 --> 47:26.640
We've been made. Target retreating, please advise.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.200
Target on the move. Repeat, please advise.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.960
Can't take the shot.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.040
It's built up. Too many non-combatants.

47:39.760 --> 47:42.000
It's done. End it.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.240
Both units, stand down.

47:52.120 --> 47:55.160
Somebody told him what we were doing here.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.600
Find out who.

48:00.280 --> 48:02.760
We'll go in ourselves. Stay on radio. Yes, Ma'am.

48:06.040 --> 48:07.760
God, it's pretty bleak.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.560
Yeah, it's a charity, isn't it?

48:09.560 --> 48:11.920
They help get ex-Forces get back on their feet.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.200
Hello?

48:20.400 --> 48:22.760
Looks even bleaker on the inside. Hmm.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.440
BELL RINGS

48:29.160 --> 48:31.000
Can I help you?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.400
Are you the manager?

48:32.400 --> 48:34.280
I'm Laura. What can I do for yous?

48:34.280 --> 48:38.680
I'm DI Longacre. We are looking for somebody who used to stay here.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.520
Aye, you're here about Ross?

48:40.520 --> 48:43.240
I already said to the polis that was here earlier on

48:43.240 --> 48:45.160
that I, I've not seen him in years.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.760
So...

48:46.760 --> 48:48.880
How did you know him?

48:48.880 --> 48:51.040
Er, well, we both stayed here.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.440
WHISPERS: OK.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.720
And what was he like?

48:56.520 --> 48:58.920
Friendly enough. Erm...

48:58.920 --> 49:00.800
Aye, he was a nice guy.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.320
Just a wee bit messed up.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.880
You know, who isn't?

49:03.880 --> 49:06.040
Do you have any information on him?

49:06.040 --> 49:09.360
I mean, do you know if he left details with friends,

49:09.360 --> 49:10.680
or a next of kin?

49:10.680 --> 49:13.360
No, we don't keep any of that stuff.

49:13.360 --> 49:16.120
I wasn't staff back then. I was... I'm...

49:16.120 --> 49:18.720
Well, I'm ex-Forces myself, so...

49:21.240 --> 49:23.520
So, if that's it, I've...

49:23.520 --> 49:25.040
I've got rooms to sort and...

49:25.040 --> 49:26.560
And he hasnae been back since?

49:27.720 --> 49:29.040
No.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.640
Do you know why we're trying to find him?

49:35.960 --> 49:39.320
He killed an Air Force officer a couple of days ago.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.960
He is not well.

49:42.040 --> 49:45.080
Now, I'm worried that he could hurt somebody else.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.480
I'm worried that he could hurt himself.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.240
Now, I spoke with him.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.920
He needs help.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.040
So, if you know where he is...

50:00.200 --> 50:02.240
He said he had nowhere else to go.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.800
There's a room at the top of the stairs. He's in number three.

50:06.800 --> 50:10.360
Listen, he never told me what he did, otherwise...

50:10.360 --> 50:12.720
..I, I would've...

50:12.720 --> 50:15.040
He's really riled up, so yous are going to need to be careful.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.640
OK, thank you.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.040
Suspect's in the building.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.880
Look you're not going to hurt him or anything, are you? No.

50:23.880 --> 50:26.560
No, just going to talk with him, see if we can help.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.960
Can you stand back, please?

50:52.600 --> 50:55.000
Armed police! Hands where we can see them!

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Stay where you are!

50:57.000 --> 50:58.720
Show us your hands.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.080
Don't do this.

51:01.080 --> 51:03.160
We need to see you don't have a weapon.

51:11.480 --> 51:12.960
I tried to make it better.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.600
I know, I know.

51:14.600 --> 51:15.920
I know you did.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.480
You were lied to, Ross.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.320
OK?

51:24.320 --> 51:26.360
There's a way back from this.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.000
Not for me.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.840
There's no way back.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.640
Stay where you are. Don't move!

51:39.640 --> 51:40.680
GUNSHOT

51:42.040 --> 51:44.640
HE GROANS

51:47.720 --> 51:49.720
Shots fired, suspect down.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.520
We need an ambulance.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.720
I thought he was listening to me.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.000
He knew what he was doing.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.400
Suspect unarmed.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.960
DOOR UNLOCKS

52:51.720 --> 52:54.800
Nothing worse than debriefing a mission that's gone to shit.

52:57.400 --> 52:58.960
Who warned him?

53:00.640 --> 53:02.880
It was Barker. No, Barker's in the clear.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.160
It had to be someone who was on that op.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.240
Who was flying?

53:07.560 --> 53:10.560
Lawson, Kain and Sadeghi.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.280
But they don't have phones. There's protocol inside the cabins.

53:14.280 --> 53:17.480
Er, Kader said he was getting briefed as well.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.640
Yeah, that's right. He was the standby pilot.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.080
Could it be Kader?

53:24.440 --> 53:26.600
Where did Abdullah Ghazali work?

53:26.600 --> 53:28.200
King Nasser University.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.560
He's been teaching political science there since 2009.

53:30.560 --> 53:34.280
It's where Kader studied. I met one of his old classmates.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.320
I've just come from debriefing him.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.440
Where is he now? He asked for permission to leave the base.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.840
And I gave it to him.

53:45.840 --> 53:48.400
Hey, I'll see you in a sec. I'm going to stay on here.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.960
Sam must have told Sabi to steal the console on Ghazali's orders.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.040
Uh-huh.

53:54.040 --> 53:56.840
I assume you've more experience chasing cars than I do.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.240
I was hoping to catch you.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.720
I just wanted to say...

54:16.720 --> 54:18.840
..I miss you.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.640
And, erm...

54:20.640 --> 54:23.480
..I'm sorry that I was irritable...before.

54:25.160 --> 54:26.560
I love you.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.120
That's him.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.520
Don't lose him. I don't want him to see us.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.720
Aren't you going to follow him?

55:22.720 --> 55:24.280
Just wait.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.520
See?

57:02.440 --> 57:04.520
That's Ghazali.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.840
No.

57:07.640 --> 57:09.000
We've got to go.
