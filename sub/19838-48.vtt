00:08.490 --> 00:11.310
<b>Facing the palace, each of the three exits</b>

00:11.810 --> 00:14.990
<b>is progressively closer to the throne room.</b>

00:20.070 --> 00:22.740
<b>Okay, we're all agreed.</b>

00:23.430 --> 00:28.020
<b>We'll all use the closest exit, 
and bust in from beside the central stairway.</b>

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
<b>Confusion x And x Expectation</b>

01:59.330 --> 02:02.920
<b>This seemed like a good idea 
since Leol-sama praised me so much,</b>

02:02.920 --> 02:04.670
<b>but dispelling <i>Nen</i> is hard.</b>

02:11.480 --> 02:16.420
<b>And the stronger the <i>Nen</i>, 
the bigger my stomach gets.</b>

02:16.950 --> 02:18.490
<b>This was a bad idea.</b>

02:19.480 --> 02:23.620
<b>To a girl, there's nothing 
worse than losing your figure.</b>

02:23.920 --> 02:27.060
<b>I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!</b>

02:27.060 --> 02:28.120
<b>Right, Shidore?</b>

02:31.330 --> 02:35.250
<b><i>Having a peon that understands 
speech is useful, but...</i></b>

02:36.070 --> 02:39.510
<b>You really need to talk more.</b>

02:43.240 --> 02:46.360
<b>You have permission to shoot her on sight!</b>

02:46.760 --> 02:50.020
<b>As a foreigner, she can't blend 
in with the other citizens!</b>

02:50.450 --> 02:52.810
<b><i>Damn! Damn that woman!</i></b>

02:53.550 --> 02:55.170
<b><i>What does she want?</i></b>

02:55.440 --> 02:56.150
<b>Hey!</b>

03:03.060 --> 03:06.370
<b>How many times have I told you 
not to use your cell phone here?</b>

03:06.640 --> 03:09.660
<b>The radio waves irritate my ears, 
and it gives me a headache!</b>

03:10.150 --> 03:11.920
<b><i>Plus, I can hear what you're saying.</i></b>

03:12.770 --> 03:15.930
<b>Next time I catch you, I'll snap your 
phone and your arm in half.</b>

03:15.930 --> 03:20.150
<b>W-Well... There are urgent matters 
that must be dealt with.</b>

03:20.150 --> 03:22.300
<b>I need to use my phone.</b>

03:23.550 --> 03:26.310
<b>It's so urgent that you find 
the woman who ran away?</b>

03:28.840 --> 03:30.640
<b>I can find her for you.</b>

03:30.960 --> 03:32.310
<b>R-Really?</b>

03:32.760 --> 03:35.620
<b>My nose happens to be very sharp...</b>

03:36.240 --> 03:39.460
<b>If you have something she wore, I can track her.</b>

03:40.020 --> 03:43.070
<b>The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do,</b>

03:43.070 --> 03:44.740
<b>and I respect you, as well!</b>

03:45.130 --> 03:49.330
<b>So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here.</b>

03:50.110 --> 03:51.080
<b>O-Okay!</b>

03:51.540 --> 03:53.770
<b>Hold on, and I'll bring you something.</b>

03:57.480 --> 03:59.540
<b><i>I will become the King behind the scenes.</i></b>

03:59.540 --> 04:03.270
<b><i>To accomplish that, I must be friendly 
with Bizeff, not with the King.</i></b>

04:03.550 --> 04:07.640
<b>Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued.</b>

04:07.640 --> 04:08.220
<b><i>Bah.</i></b>

04:08.910 --> 04:11.250
<b><i>When peons send transmissions, 
it gives me a headache.</i></b>

04:13.830 --> 04:15.090
<b><i>This smells like...</i></b>

04:15.090 --> 04:16.800
<b><i>Taragette's blood.</i></b>

04:17.110 --> 04:19.360
<b><i>There are bloodstains and dirty shoes.</i></b>

04:19.550 --> 04:20.680
<b><i>An intruder!</i></b>

04:21.090 --> 04:24.360
<b><i>If he took his shoes off here 
to avoid leaving footprints,</i></b>

04:24.860 --> 04:27.610
<b><i>he must be somewhere deeper within.</i></b>

04:28.060 --> 04:29.870
<b><i>He didn't hide his shoes because</i></b>

04:29.870 --> 04:34.120
<b><i>he had a pressing mission and 
couldn't afford to lose time...</i></b>

04:35.040 --> 04:37.100
<b><i>That day last week, when it rained?</i></b>

04:37.730 --> 04:41.560
<b><i>That was the day Taragette went missing.</i></b>

04:41.990 --> 04:44.980
<b><i>I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him.</i></b>

04:45.860 --> 04:49.740
<b><i>But that means he disposed of Taragette's body</i></b>

04:49.740 --> 04:51.600
<b><i>while leaving his shoes behind.</i></b>

04:52.140 --> 04:54.000
<b><i>There's no blood trail nearby.</i></b>

04:54.420 --> 04:57.890
<b><i>If he wrapped the body in something to move it,</i></b>

04:57.890 --> 05:00.650
<b><i>he must have come prepared.</i></b>

05:00.960 --> 05:02.650
<b><i>Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?</i></b>

05:02.960 --> 05:04.180
<b><i>Why would they do that?!</i></b>

05:04.630 --> 05:05.900
<b><i>Damn, I don't get this!</i></b>

05:06.480 --> 05:08.570
<b><i>Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?</i></b>

05:09.110 --> 05:12.410
<b><i>No, I'll catch the intruder, 
and get the answers from him.</i></b>

05:18.530 --> 05:21.680
<b><i>He did head inside the palace!</i></b>

05:22.320 --> 05:24.640
<b><i>This guy comes before Bizeff's woman...</i></b>

05:25.440 --> 05:26.890
<b>Follow me!</b>

05:36.840 --> 05:39.300
<b><i>What is your name?</i></b>

05:39.300 --> 05:42.440
<b><i>It's K-K-Komugi.</i></b>

05:42.960 --> 05:45.380
<b><i>Can you please tell me what your name is?</i></b>

05:49.610 --> 05:52.950
<b><i>I didn't get to learn his name...</i></b>

05:58.640 --> 06:01.340
<b><i>I can't wait to play him again!</i></b>

06:09.480 --> 06:11.600
<b><i>Who am I?</i></b>

06:13.640 --> 06:17.300
<b><i>A nameless king... in a borrowed castle.</i></b>

06:18.200 --> 06:22.110
<b><i>My subjects are mindless puppets.</i></b>

06:23.500 --> 06:26.610
<b><i>If this is the fate that the 
heavens have granted me...</i></b>

06:30.540 --> 06:34.940
<b><i>I have no doubt that I shall 
be slowly bored to death!</i></b>

06:46.400 --> 06:47.630
<b>Don't follow me.</b>

06:47.980 --> 06:49.090
<b>Yes, but—</b>

06:51.120 --> 06:52.390
<b>Do not make me repeat myself.</b>

06:58.790 --> 07:01.830
<b>Now we've all been beaten by the King.</b>

07:05.380 --> 07:08.150
<b>The King says your <i>En</i> is irritating him.</b>

07:09.530 --> 07:12.770
<b>I figured he would be saying that soon.</b>

07:12.770 --> 07:15.660
<b>But I can't remove our security...</b>

07:16.490 --> 07:18.380
<b>Then you go and tell him that!</b>

07:18.380 --> 07:20.590
<b>I don't want another beating.</b>

07:21.930 --> 07:23.700
<b>How does this sound?</b>

07:24.520 --> 07:28.040
<b>We can block all aura in a radius 
surrounding Your Majesty.</b>

07:28.700 --> 07:33.050
<b>This way, my presence will not bother you.</b>

07:33.530 --> 07:35.680
<b>Are you telling me to stay in one place?</b>

07:36.600 --> 07:38.680
<b>Given that keeping</b>

07:38.680 --> 07:43.650
<b>the aura-free zone around me 
while I move wouldn't be possible.</b>

07:43.650 --> 07:47.340
<b>I refuse to have my movement 
constantly monitored.</b>

07:47.680 --> 07:51.700
<b>No, that would not be our proposal.</b>

07:52.070 --> 07:56.700
<b>So if I do not wish to deal with your presence, 
I will only be able to move</b>

07:56.700 --> 07:59.190
<b>within that confined area.</b>

07:59.660 --> 08:04.960
<b>I must order you to move that zone 
should I wish to go elsewhere?</b>

08:05.870 --> 08:07.910
<b>There is nothing more I can say.</b>

08:08.420 --> 08:11.940
<b>Keep your <i>En</i> focused outside the palace.</b>

08:12.370 --> 08:15.930
<b>I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection.</b>

08:17.150 --> 08:18.180
<b>Are you dissatisfied?</b>

08:18.530 --> 08:22.440
<b>Should that not suffice to guard 
against outside attacks?</b>

08:22.990 --> 08:27.110
<b>Or are you saying that there 
are already enemies inside?</b>

08:27.850 --> 08:34.940
<b>That would be admitting that your <i>En</i>
 is completely worthless, would it not?</b>

08:35.370 --> 08:36.620
<b>You're absolutely correct.</b>

08:37.410 --> 08:42.490
<b>If my <i>En</i> is focused only outside, it cannot detect</b>

08:42.490 --> 08:45.020
<b>any attack from underground.</b>

08:45.930 --> 08:46.800
<b>In addition,</b>

08:46.800 --> 08:53.080
<b>my <i>En</i> is not capable of recognizing 
an enemy that is already inside.</b>

08:53.280 --> 08:56.010
<b>Do you mean Komugi?</b>

08:56.370 --> 09:01.690
<b>No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace,</b>

09:02.250 --> 09:07.150
<b>and they are free to enter and leave at will.</b>

09:07.840 --> 09:11.340
<b>A check is performed each time someone enters,</b>

09:11.670 --> 09:15.160
<b>but if the soldier were being 
controlled by the enemy,</b>

09:15.160 --> 09:17.640
<b>it would be difficult to know for sure.</b>

09:18.120 --> 09:18.790
<b>That means—</b>

09:18.790 --> 09:19.690
<b>Enough.</b>

09:20.020 --> 09:22.530
<b>You may use <i>En</i> on the first floor of the palace!</b>

09:22.950 --> 09:26.290
<b>That will permit you to guard 
against any underground attack!</b>

09:27.090 --> 09:30.030
<b>Tell everyone that no one is allowed 
on the second floor or above.</b>

09:30.410 --> 09:34.800
<b>Should an intruder come, I shall 
deal with them personally.</b>

09:35.360 --> 09:37.980
<b>Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!</b>

09:37.980 --> 09:40.540
<b>If you disturb me, it will 
have violent consequences!</b>

09:42.310 --> 09:43.730
<b>The other Ants</b>

09:43.730 --> 09:47.810
<b>were never allowed on or above the second floor...</b>

09:48.680 --> 09:51.470
<b>But where do I go now?</b>

09:51.470 --> 09:55.440
<b>The central stairway connecting the 
first and second floors, I suppose...</b>

09:56.340 --> 09:58.800
<b>If an intruder comes from underground,</b>

09:58.800 --> 10:01.200
<b>you will be in position to deal with them.</b>

10:01.580 --> 10:04.740
<b>Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately.</b>

10:05.200 --> 10:08.490
<b>Is he upset about losing 
all those Gungi matches?</b>

10:10.240 --> 10:14.270
<b><i>I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation.</i></b>

10:14.970 --> 10:20.470
<b><i>My ability, Spiritual Message, would be 
able to confirm my suspicions.</i></b>

10:21.640 --> 10:25.710
<b><i>However, that would be an insult to the King!</i></b>

10:26.390 --> 10:28.750
<b><i>No, I'm just making excuses...</i></b>

10:29.620 --> 10:33.000
<b><i>The truth is that I'm afraid.</i></b>

10:34.370 --> 10:36.470
<b><i>So afraid of what it is</i></b>

10:37.470 --> 10:40.500
<b><i>that grows inside the King even as we speak,</i></b>

10:41.800 --> 10:43.090
<b><i>I cannot bear it...</i></b>

10:51.170 --> 10:55.130
<b><i>Tsk, the rain washed away the scent.</i></b>

10:55.130 --> 10:56.640
<b><i>But now I have the answer.</i></b>

10:57.810 --> 11:01.010
<b><i>The intruder hid here to 
check the second floor,</i></b>

11:01.520 --> 11:04.280
<b><i>but instead of going upstairs, he exited.</i></b>

11:05.120 --> 11:07.330
<b><i>Something made him give up his mission?</i></b>

11:07.960 --> 11:10.770
<b><i>Or did he accomplish his objective?</i></b>

11:10.770 --> 11:13.390
<b><i>No, he may have used his power!</i></b>

11:15.400 --> 11:17.130
<b>I should probably warn you...</b>

11:17.550 --> 11:21.030
<b>If any of you go to the second 
floor, the King will kill you.</b>

11:21.860 --> 11:24.280
<b>Tell everyone else in the palace.</b>

11:25.020 --> 11:25.780
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

11:26.220 --> 11:27.590
<b><i>Wings!</i></b>

11:27.590 --> 11:30.560
<b><i>What if the intruder has the power to fly?</i></b>

11:31.030 --> 11:33.090
<b><i>The shoes and scent could have 
been there to mislead us.</i></b>

11:33.760 --> 11:37.050
<b><i>He could have flown up to the second floor!</i></b>

11:37.390 --> 11:38.380
<b>Youpi-dono...</b>

11:38.720 --> 11:39.300
<b>Huh?</b>

11:39.570 --> 11:41.200
<b>Uh, er...</b>

11:41.670 --> 11:43.860
<b><i>Pitou is monitoring the palace with </i>En.</b>

11:44.170 --> 11:48.350
<b><i>If they'd gone to the second floor, 
they would have been caught...</i></b>

11:48.350 --> 11:51.210
<b>Ah, sorry... It's not important.</b>

11:51.470 --> 11:52.400
<b>Huh?</b>

11:52.400 --> 11:53.650
<b><i>That doesn't make sense!</i></b>

11:53.650 --> 11:56.960
<b><i>Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!</i></b>

11:56.960 --> 11:57.860
<b>Youpi-dono...</b>

11:58.290 --> 11:59.820
<b>Huh? What is it?</b>

12:00.410 --> 12:03.370
<b>Has Pitou-dono ever ceased to use <i>En</i>?</b>

12:03.700 --> 12:07.200
<b>For example, that day last week when it rained?</b>

12:07.720 --> 12:10.290
<b>What? You didn't hear what happened?</b>

12:10.290 --> 12:11.970
<b>There was a huge uproar...</b>

12:12.380 --> 12:14.710
<b>The King tore off his own arm!</b>

12:16.060 --> 12:20.980
<b>Pitou had to heal the King, 
so Pouf was using his <i>En</i> instead.</b>

12:20.980 --> 12:23.970
<b>How wide is his <i>En</i>?</b>

12:24.360 --> 12:26.420
<b>I wouldn't know about that...</b>

12:26.420 --> 12:28.100
<b>Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?</b>

12:28.840 --> 12:33.550
<b><i>No, I'd guess that Pouf's </i>En<i> only 
reached as far as the stairway.</i></b>

12:34.150 --> 12:35.900
<b><i>The intruder saw that aura,</i></b>

12:35.900 --> 12:37.810
<b><i>and gave up on ascending!</i></b>

12:37.810 --> 12:38.730
<b><i>That all makes sense.</i></b>

12:39.290 --> 12:41.230
<b><i>The question is what the 
intruder's objective was,</i></b>

12:41.230 --> 12:45.610
<b><i>and whether he's still hiding around here.</i></b>

12:46.600 --> 12:48.740
<b><i>Do I tell Youpi?</i></b>

12:48.740 --> 12:50.620
<b><i>No, I can't do that...</i></b>

12:51.900 --> 12:54.230
<b><i>I should report this to Pitou or Pouf.</i></b>

12:54.230 --> 12:55.770
<b><i>Pouf would be the best choice.</i></b>

12:56.200 --> 12:59.380
<b><i>And if possible, I need to determine</i></b>

12:59.380 --> 13:01.250
<b><i>what the intruder's objective was.</i></b>

13:02.290 --> 13:03.880
<b><i>Otherwise, my report would be</i></b>

13:03.880 --> 13:07.210
<b><i>that the intruder somehow 
made it inside the palace,</i></b>

13:07.210 --> 13:10.640
<b><i>but turned and ran when he felt Pouf's</i> En<i>.</i></b>

13:10.640 --> 13:12.440
<b><i>I won't get any credit.</i></b>

13:13.460 --> 13:16.760
<b><i>I can make up an objective,</i></b>

13:16.760 --> 13:19.430
<b><i>but if the intruder is captured, 
they'll find out I lied.</i></b>

13:19.800 --> 13:24.470
<b><i>But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions 
and the intruder is never found,</i></b>

13:24.470 --> 13:29.100
<b><i>it would only waste their time 
and damage my own standing.</i></b>

13:30.660 --> 13:32.160
<b><i>Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!</i></b>

13:33.700 --> 13:35.310
<b><i>I have a great idea...</i></b>

13:36.480 --> 13:39.910
<b>So the intruder captured one of my men.</b>

13:39.910 --> 13:44.300
<b>According to Leol, that intruder 
has the ability to teleport.</b>

13:44.690 --> 13:47.250
<b>I believe that he and the 
woman are working together.</b>

13:47.250 --> 13:49.690
<b>They probably teleported out together.</b>

13:50.500 --> 13:53.870
<b>Damn, but why would they do that?</b>

13:53.870 --> 13:55.810
<b>Yes, that's the question.</b>

13:56.320 --> 13:59.900
<b>However, I've discerned their objective.</b>

13:59.900 --> 14:00.440
<b>What is it?</b>

14:01.680 --> 14:03.940
<b>To blow up the palace.</b>

14:04.590 --> 14:05.370
<b><i>That's a lie.</i></b>

14:05.370 --> 14:06.220
<b>What?</b>

14:06.220 --> 14:07.850
<b>We must tell the Royal Guard!</b>

14:07.850 --> 14:08.810
<b>Wait.</b>

14:09.640 --> 14:11.010
<b>Don't be in such a rush.</b>

14:11.010 --> 14:13.450
<b>We can tell them after we've found the bomb.</b>

14:13.870 --> 14:15.290
<b>There's no time!</b>

14:15.780 --> 14:18.790
<b>Calm down, and consider this 
from their perspective...</b>

14:19.090 --> 14:19.940
<b>Eh?</b>

14:19.940 --> 14:23.470
<b>If they want to blow up the palace, 
they'll wait until they're sure the King is here.</b>

14:23.820 --> 14:24.800
<b>When would that be?</b>

14:25.440 --> 14:27.460
<b>When all the citizens have assembled...</b>

14:27.970 --> 14:30.350
<b>Right before the ceremony begins!</b>

14:31.000 --> 14:33.260
<b>There will be five million humans!</b>

14:33.260 --> 14:34.580
<b>What a sight that will be to see...</b>

14:34.980 --> 14:36.690
<b>Just imagine looking down on them!</b>

14:37.180 --> 14:40.200
<b>The King would not allow a double 
to steal that gratification from him!</b>

14:40.690 --> 14:43.450
<b>So he will be there in person!</b>

14:43.990 --> 14:47.090
<b>It's only logical to assume the enemy 
reached the same conclusion.</b>

14:47.090 --> 14:48.080
<b><i>True...</i></b>

14:48.530 --> 14:52.540
<b><i>I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's 
side for many of these celebrations...</i></b>

14:53.490 --> 14:57.960
<b><i>The experience brings indescribable 
pleasure beyond even sexual gratification.</i></b>

14:58.240 --> 15:00.720
<b>We still have over half a day 
before the ceremony.</b>

15:01.090 --> 15:03.670
<b>If I use my nose to track the intruder,</b>

15:04.070 --> 15:06.740
<b>we can find the bomb with time to spare.</b>

15:07.310 --> 15:11.970
<b>If we have proof when we report to the 
Royal Guard, we'll look much better.</b>

15:12.390 --> 15:16.510
<b>If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful.</b>

15:17.160 --> 15:17.860
<b>Right?</b>

15:18.770 --> 15:21.530
<b>Yes... That's true.</b>

15:22.800 --> 15:25.800
<b>As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you.</b>

15:26.070 --> 15:27.430
<b>Okay, that sounds good.</b>

15:30.560 --> 15:33.870
<b><i>The coward finally calmed down?</i></b>

15:36.160 --> 15:40.620
<b><i>I'm getting closer to becoming 
the King behind the scenes!</i></b>

15:49.020 --> 15:50.380
<b>Seven minutes to go.</b>

15:50.760 --> 15:53.350
<b>I'll give a call when it's down to one minute.</b>

15:53.350 --> 15:54.920
<b>Assemble near the exit then.</b>

15:55.340 --> 15:57.010
<b>Until then, stand by.</b>

15:58.790 --> 16:01.620
<b>Meleoron, about your power...</b>

16:01.620 --> 16:02.970
<b>I know.</b>

16:02.970 --> 16:06.400
<b>I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds 
before I need to breathe...</b>

16:07.160 --> 16:11.150
<b>And then, I'll tap you again when 
I start to hold my breath again!</b>

16:12.780 --> 16:15.620
<b>You don't need to push your limits.</b>

16:15.620 --> 16:18.840
<b>You should catch your breath 
whenever you need to.</b>

16:19.260 --> 16:24.530
<b>When God's Accomplice isn't active, 
you can trust me to handle things.</b>

16:30.580 --> 16:33.260
<b>Why don't you have a smoke?</b>

16:33.680 --> 16:38.290
<b>If you underestimate their sense 
of smell, you'll die quickly...</b>

16:38.290 --> 16:42.120
<b>Tracking someone by the smell of 
cigarette smoke is simple for them.</b>

16:42.120 --> 16:46.220
<b>We could be knocked out the 
second I take my first breath...</b>

16:46.590 --> 16:50.730
<b>The boss will be putting up a smokescreen 
when we go in. It'll be fine.</b>

16:50.730 --> 16:55.320
<b>I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk.</b>

16:56.480 --> 16:58.580
<b>I don't want to regret my decision.</b>

17:00.540 --> 17:02.590
<b>The Royal Guard is on the move.</b>

17:04.470 --> 17:08.640
<b>The three of them gathered above the 
front gate to discuss something.</b>

17:09.070 --> 17:11.710
<b>Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside.</b>

17:12.810 --> 17:15.050
<b>Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales,</b>

17:15.050 --> 17:17.720
<b>so I don't think anything has changed.</b>

17:19.950 --> 17:21.970
<b>I'll let you know if anything else happens.</b>

17:22.620 --> 17:26.600
<b>Yeah, until we leave, feed us as 
much information as you can.</b>

17:28.740 --> 17:31.630
<b>Essentially, that eliminates the 
possibility of the Royal Guard</b>

17:31.630 --> 17:32.610
<b>being out of the palace.</b>

17:33.220 --> 17:36.580
<b><i>Essentially, but not completely...</i></b>

17:36.870 --> 17:40.670
<b>Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King.</b>

17:40.670 --> 17:41.870
<b>You can't guarantee anything.</b>

17:42.400 --> 17:45.070
<b>We have to be prepared for any possibility,</b>

17:45.070 --> 17:47.010
<b>or we'll be slow to react when 
something goes wrong!</b>

17:47.500 --> 17:50.890
<b>You only say that because you don't 
understand how loyal they are.</b>

17:50.890 --> 17:53.320
<b>It's impossible that they'd leave the King!</b>

17:53.320 --> 17:56.620
<b>The Royal Guard is always with the King!</b>

17:56.620 --> 17:59.430
<b>And it's fine to believe that!</b>

17:59.430 --> 18:01.590
<b>But we should prepare for any exceptions!</b>

18:01.590 --> 18:03.390
<b>Give me an example of one 
of these exceptions!</b>

18:03.630 --> 18:06.430
<b>There are all kinds of exceptions!</b>

18:04.390 --> 18:08.650
<b><i>Honestly, how can they be having 
a dispute at the last second?</i></b>

18:06.430 --> 18:08.650
<b>You're being too unrealistic!</b>

18:09.370 --> 18:11.650
<b>One exception could be a woman...</b>

18:13.400 --> 18:15.890
<b>Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?</b>

18:16.300 --> 18:20.810
<b>I wasn't sure what the King was doing in 
the palace, but he was reproducing.</b>

18:20.810 --> 18:22.030
<b>That must be it.</b>

18:22.700 --> 18:23.800
<b>I see...</b>

18:24.170 --> 18:30.080
<b>That would give the King a reason to keep 
the Royal Guard from his bedroom...</b>

18:30.520 --> 18:34.550
<b>Perhaps Bizeff was bringing 
women in for the King.</b>

18:39.320 --> 18:42.260
<b>Palm and the King?!</b>

18:44.180 --> 18:45.960
<b>We're sticking to the plan...</b>

18:46.370 --> 18:49.180
<b>No matter what's happening to Palm!</b>

18:50.700 --> 18:52.690
<b><i>Gon has no idea what they're talking about.</i></b>

18:53.330 --> 18:56.440
<b><i>I'm glad we realized this before we set out.</i></b>

18:56.440 --> 18:58.950
<b><i>If we'd seen something like 
that without warning,</i></b>

18:58.950 --> 19:00.950
<b><i>we'd have frozen in our tracks.</i></b>

19:01.360 --> 19:02.680
<b>Get it now?</b>

19:02.680 --> 19:05.530
<b>You can never overthink something.</b>

19:05.900 --> 19:08.830
<b>There are probably other unexpected 
situations that we haven't considered yet.</b>

19:09.690 --> 19:12.560
<b><i>Yes, something is still bothering me.</i></b>

19:13.260 --> 19:13.980
<b>Gon...</b>

19:15.040 --> 19:16.210
<b>Do you understand?</b>

19:16.210 --> 19:18.220
<b>Let Palm take care of herself!</b>

19:18.640 --> 19:21.790
<b>No matter what you see, 
you must stay focused on Pitou.</b>

19:22.220 --> 19:22.970
<b>Yeah!</b>

19:23.790 --> 19:27.440
<b><i>It bothers me, but whether 
a woman's involved or not,</i></b>

19:27.440 --> 19:30.060
<b><i>I believe we should be prepared 
for a third party in the palace.</i></b>

19:30.830 --> 19:32.980
<b><i>I have a feeling that the third party</i></b>

19:32.980 --> 19:35.160
<b><i>is causing my anxiety.</i></b>

19:35.960 --> 19:38.990
<b>Why did the King injure himself?</b>

19:39.350 --> 19:41.110
<b>Hold on...</b>

19:41.110 --> 19:43.990
<b>That was just a theory of yours.</b>

19:43.990 --> 19:48.000
<b>Yeah, but you agreed that there 
was no other logical explanation.</b>

19:48.630 --> 19:51.480
<b>You're contradicting yourself...</b>

19:51.480 --> 19:55.130
<b>Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?</b>

19:55.480 --> 19:57.550
<b>Following that logic,</b>

19:57.550 --> 20:03.040
<b>Pitou could have stopped using <i>En</i> 
for other, unexpected reasons.</b>

20:03.040 --> 20:04.880
<b>I understand that...</b>

20:04.880 --> 20:06.140
<b>But something doesn't feel right.</b>

20:06.700 --> 20:12.960
<b>With three minutes left to go, is this 
something worth thinking about?</b>

20:13.420 --> 20:14.150
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:14.500 --> 20:16.780
<b>Yeah, think about it...</b>

20:17.160 --> 20:20.730
<b>When would you try to hurt yourself?</b>

20:25.900 --> 20:29.040
<b>When I couldn't forgive myself...</b>

20:33.480 --> 20:35.680
<b>When you couldn't forgive yourself?</b>

20:36.550 --> 20:38.050
<b>That's the logical conclusion...</b>

20:38.860 --> 20:44.820
<b>But that would mean the King 
is a ruler with personal pride,</b>

20:44.820 --> 20:46.400
<b>and not just a cold tyrant.</b>

20:46.400 --> 20:47.300
<b>True.</b>

20:48.160 --> 20:53.160
<b>For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain.</b>

20:53.960 --> 20:55.520
<b>Speaking from experience,</b>

20:55.520 --> 20:59.180
<b>people like him will never 
be willing to compromise.</b>

20:59.880 --> 21:03.320
<b>If the leader refuses to compromise, 
neither will the Royal Guard.</b>

21:03.970 --> 21:07.010
<b>You should assume that combat 
will be our only option!</b>

21:08.640 --> 21:11.050
<b><i>Morel was able to sum everything up...</i></b>

21:11.500 --> 21:12.660
<b><i>But he's wrong.</i></b>

21:13.630 --> 21:15.120
<b><i>The King's self-injury...</i></b>

21:15.500 --> 21:17.050
<b><i>The third party...</i></b>

21:17.750 --> 21:21.210
<b><i>We still haven't correctly 
deduced what happened.</i></b>

21:22.390 --> 21:23.720
<b><i>I have a feeling...</i></b>

21:24.370 --> 21:30.130
<b><i>that the truth has the potential 
to completely ruin our plans!</i></b>

21:30.590 --> 21:31.660
<b>It's time!</b>

21:32.580 --> 21:34.260
<b>One minute to go.</b>

21:34.750 --> 21:35.730
<b>Gather around.</b>

21:36.380 --> 21:38.480
<b><i>Damn! We're out of time...</i></b>

21:50.630 --> 21:53.250
<b>At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown.</b>

21:55.580 --> 21:56.870
<b>Let's do this, boys.</b>

21:58.240 --> 22:00.270
<b>Get ready to rumble!</b>

23:25.030 --> 23:27.350
<b>Next time: Charge x And x Invade.</b>

23:27.350 --> 23:29.900
<b>Yeah, hot pots are great in winter...</b>

23:29.900 --> 23:31.700
<b>Which reminds me of mystery pots.</b>

23:31.700 --> 23:32.800
<b>Charge into the pot!</b>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.020
<b>I think you mean toss into the pot...</b>
