00:04.265 --> 00:06.180
Every morning, I wake up

00:06.267 --> 00:07.529
and for about two seconds,

00:07.616 --> 00:09.052
I feel pretty good.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.228
And then I remember

00:11.315 --> 00:13.230
that Jodi died.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.753
[sighs]

00:14.840 --> 00:16.451
And I'’m trying to be grateful

00:16.538 --> 00:18.105
for those two seconds,

00:18.192 --> 00:19.932
but I can'’t.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.719
I just hate this disease.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.592
I hate it
that it took our friend.

00:27.679 --> 00:31.248
I hate it that I'’m going
to twice as many meetings,

00:31.335 --> 00:33.859
and they don'’t seem to help.

00:33.946 --> 00:36.123
I don'’t...
even see the point anymore.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.391
Thanks. That'’s it.

Why are we clapping?

00:50.789 --> 00:52.400
Who else would
like to share?

00:52.487 --> 00:55.098
I would.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.795
Marjorie, alcoholic.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.493
ALL: Hi, Marjorie.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.495
Unlike everyone else,

01:00.582 --> 01:03.237
I just found out
about Jodi'’s death yesterday,

01:03.324 --> 01:06.109
so instead of grieving
with all of you,

01:06.196 --> 01:08.416
I was on a cruise ship
to Alaska.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.984
That'’s not the choice
I would have made...

01:12.072 --> 01:13.899
[exhales]

01:13.986 --> 01:15.553
...but that choice
was made for me.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.338
I'’m sorry.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.991
I just wanted you
to enjoy your honeymoon.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.776
Hey. This is my share.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.431
Sorry.

01:23.518 --> 01:27.957
Anyway, right now I am so angry
and frustrated

01:28.044 --> 01:30.699
that I can'’t even get to
how heartbroken I am

01:30.786 --> 01:32.744
over losing
that sweet little girl.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.059
[door opens, shuts]

01:46.062 --> 01:47.585
I'’m Bonnie,
I'’m an alcoholic.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.152
ALL [quietly]:
Hi, Bonnie.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.547
Last time I lost
somebody I loved,

01:52.634 --> 01:54.636
I started using again.

01:54.723 --> 01:57.465
As I recall, it didn'’t go well.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.162
Went on a three-day tear,

01:59.249 --> 02:01.556
almost destroyed my relationship
with my daughter,

02:01.643 --> 02:03.166
and, as a parting gift,

02:03.253 --> 02:05.168
I got a DUI.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.388
So if I start acting squirrely,
do me a favor:

02:07.475 --> 02:08.693
show me my mug shot.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.525
That'’ll do it.

02:17.093 --> 02:19.269
Am I the only one
who'’s eating this pie?

02:19.356 --> 02:21.271
Too sad to eat.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.664
Isn'’t that what pie'’s for?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.058
[sighs]
Let'’s just get the check.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.060
If I'’m gonna be miserable,
I'’d rather be alone.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.715
Usually, when you'’re miserable,
I prefer that you'’re alone.

02:30.802 --> 02:34.023
But maybe this time,
we do something different.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.242
Like what?

02:35.329 --> 02:37.592
Something to get
our minds off of Jodi.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.944
No, I'’m not talking
about drinking.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.686
An opportunity recently
came across my desk.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.340
You don'’t have a desk.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.777
All right, it was a text message
from an old colleague.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.344
You don'’t have colleagues.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.563
Do you want to hear this or not?

02:52.650 --> 02:53.782
Fine, go.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.350
There'’s a certain substance--

02:56.437 --> 02:58.656
pure, uncut--

02:58.743 --> 03:00.745
that we can buy
in Canada

03:00.832 --> 03:02.791

03:02.878 --> 03:05.750
smuggle back here
and sell to my colleague

03:05.837 --> 03:08.492

03:08.579 --> 03:11.408
Our friend just died
of an overdose

03:11.495 --> 03:13.149
and you want to smuggle
drugs to get over it?

I'’m not talking about drugs.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.108
Then what are you
talking about?

03:19.111 --> 03:21.157
Maple syrup.

I don'’t understand.

03:24.639 --> 03:25.988
Is that a street name
for something?

03:26.075 --> 03:28.208
No, it'’s the actual name.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.166
You mean the stuff
you put on pancakes?

03:30.253 --> 03:31.994
Or waffles, French toast...

03:32.081 --> 03:33.691
Ooh. Have you ever
put it on bacon?

03:33.778 --> 03:35.563
No, that sounds good.

isn'’t illegal.

the back of a truck.

make a mess?
