(Crowd chattering)

00:18.853 --> 00:20.309
(J‘ Horn plays riff)

00:20.438 --> 00:22.554
(Man) Come on! Hey, baby.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.267
(J‘ Horns riffing)

00:34.744 --> 00:36.325
(J‘ Instruments warming up)

00:59.769 --> 01:02.101
(Man laughs)

01:02.230 --> 01:03.811
(Woman) Oh, my God...

01:03.940 --> 01:05.771
(Chatter continues)

01:17.787 --> 01:20.449
(J‘ Rap music blaring on car stereo)

01:20.581 --> 01:23.038
(Man) That ain't right.
(Second man) Should be ten.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.953
Price was 12, bro.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.998
Say, bro, 1200 was for eight pieces.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.258
And you said you was going
to have Shorty kickin' it with y'all.

01:31.384 --> 01:34.000
— Shorty gonna make it.
— Yeah, well, he ain't here now.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.094
And I seen y'all ain't got
but the one 'bone out there, bro.

01:37.223 --> 01:40.181
Now look, we already cut our price.
And we now have seven to step off.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.095
Say, baby, seven don't get you 12.

01:42.228 --> 01:44.970
— Seven get you ten, seem to me.
— (Man) Yeah, you right.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.222
Man, look around. Look at this damn place.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.019
Hmm, look at it.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.016
How much water y'all get up here?

01:51.153 --> 01:53.235
Shit, you see the line over my head.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.901
— Six, six and a half.
— Look, | feel for y'all.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.524
But less than 200 a man?
That shit ain't right.

01:58.661 --> 02:01.243
Say, baby, if shit was right,
you think we'd have

02:01.372 --> 02:03.613
to scrape up a couple 0' dozen
of us to do this here?

02:03.749 --> 02:06.491
You think we'd all be paradin'
on the same day?

02:06.627 --> 02:09.414
— Come on, bro.
— Most of us wearin' last year's suits.

02:09.547 --> 02:13.460
Last few dollars went to Meyer, baby,
to pay for these fedoras.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.298
(Man) Yeah, Meyer, you know.

02:15.428 --> 02:18.261
— Y'all do look correct, though.
— Well, we got to, baby.

02:19.515 --> 02:23.349
(Man) It's a tradition, man. It's a tradition.
(Second man) Come on, now take it.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.978
My man.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.265
Ha—ha! All right, brother.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.523
— 12, right?
— Money hard to come by.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.062
At least, that's what I hear.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.981
Rolling us again.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.988
— (Man) Black men, mount up, baby.
- (J‘ Drumming, horns playing)

02:42.121 --> 02:44.077
Let's go get 'em.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.618
Let's go get 'em, daddy.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.742
(Second man) Always for pleasure, baby.

02:48.878 --> 02:51.540
- Always for pleasure.
— Let's do it like we do.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.378
(J‘ Band playing loudly)

02:53.507 --> 02:55.498
(Cheering, whistles blowing)

03:51.816 --> 03:53.431
(Cheering, shouting)

03:56.862 --> 03:58.648
(All) J‘ | feel like funkin' it up

03:58.781 --> 04:00.317
J‘ Feel like funkin' it up

04:00.449 --> 04:03.907
— J‘ | feel like... J‘
— (Man) Uncle Jerry! Get that thing, boy!

04:04.036 --> 04:06.743
— (Motorcycle revs)
— (Siren chirps rhythmically)

04:08.791 --> 04:10.782
(Man) J‘ What's going on? J‘

04:23.055 --> 04:24.886
(Man) See, I'm short, I know,

04:25.015 --> 04:28.143
but if you had went down City Park Avenue
and then Esplanade and St. Claude

04:28.269 --> 04:30.260
instead of the interstate,
it would've been less.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.354
If you want to take City Park and Esplanade,
then say so.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.018
Man, I thought you knew.

04:35.151 --> 04:37.858
You say Esplanade,
I'll take you Esplanade, no problem.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.602
Look, man, when I catch up with them

04:39.738 --> 04:41.774
and play that parade, l'm—a have it, all right?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.818
l'm—a find you.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.033
- I will.
— (Chuckles, mutters)

04:47.163 --> 04:51.281
— Ha—ha. Thank you, brother, I owe you.
- Right. Yeah, you're right.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.915
(J‘ Plays riff loudly)

04:57.047 --> 05:00.539
(Man) Oh, shit, Batiste playin' Rebirth now?

05:01.469 --> 05:03.255
Who that?

05:07.099 --> 05:09.431
(Man) Running late, huh, bro?

05:29.955 --> 05:33.573
Aaah—ha—ha! What's up, bro?

05:33.709 --> 05:35.574
(Man) What's up?

05:35.711 --> 05:37.576
Aw, shit, look who the fuck showed up.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.375
When the last time you saw this
motherfucker play a second line?

05:40.508 --> 05:44.092
— First thing to go is those legs, old man.
— And he stole that from Tyrus.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.256
Man, Tyrus used to play that riff to death.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.299
Negro, if you are referring to Mr. Chapman,

05:48.432 --> 05:51.765
the fact is he appropriated
that particular musical ornamentation

05:51.894 --> 05:53.600
from my repertoire, bro.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.765
Damn! That how they talk
at them gigs uptown?

05:55.898 --> 05:58.731
- Yeah.
— Shorty ain't gonna make it, huh?

05:58.859 --> 06:01.771
Nah, Shorty sent me to show y'all
how to play this here music.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.149
(Laughs) Yeah.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.193
That's the Sixth Ward in my 'bone, baby.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.282
lnTmme
y'all don't know nothing about that.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.198
Oh, let's see how you sound
six or seven miles from now.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.037
Yeah, blow your horn, fool. You'll see.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.579
(Chuckles) Play for that money, boys.
Play for that motherfuckin' money.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.135
(All) J‘ | feel like funkin' it up

06:36.272 --> 06:38.854
J‘ Feel like funkin' it up
J‘ Funkin' it up

06:38.983 --> 06:43.101
J‘ | feel like funkin' it up, feel like funkin' it up
J‘ Feel like funkin' it up

06:43.237 --> 06:46.445
J‘ | feel like funkin' it up,
feel like funkin' it up... J‘

08:29.510 --> 08:31.967
(J‘ Music playing in distance)

08:44.400 --> 08:46.641
— (Groans)
— (Woman) I thought you were hung over.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.018
— Shh.
— (Music continues)

08:56.745 --> 08:58.576
(Woman groans)

09:02.000 --> 09:04.912
They're doin' it. They're doin' it!

09:05.754 --> 09:08.712
It's the first second line since the storm.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.457
It sounds like Rebirth.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.458
J‘ She made me cry

09:13.595 --> 09:15.460
J‘ She done me wrong

09:15.597 --> 09:17.679
J‘ Had my nose open

09:17.808 --> 09:20.015
J‘ That's no lie... J‘

09:20.144 --> 09:22.351
(He hums)

09:23.397 --> 09:25.558
Ah! Hey! No! First shower is me!

09:25.691 --> 09:28.603
— No, l have to get to the restaurant.
— l have to get to the second line!

09:28.736 --> 09:31.102
Whatever hot water
you have in here is for me.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.446
- Not you, me.
— Fine. (Chuckles)

09:34.575 --> 09:37.362
(Water trickling)

09:37.494 --> 09:39.701
(Faucet squeaks)

09:41.415 --> 09:43.497
Davis!

09:44.209 --> 09:49.124
Oh. You know what?
I'm this close to getting a new water heater.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.167
Hey, do you think you could float me a loan?

09:51.300 --> 09:53.416
Oh, good God.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.918
Well, I'm a musician.
What do you want me to say?

09:56.054 --> 09:58.010
You're a disc jockey.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.883
I can't believe I didn't go home last night
when I had the chance.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.809
Yeah, no cold shower for you, huh?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.553
You are a cold shower.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.648
Last night...not so much.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.559
(Groans) Yeah.

10:12.696 --> 10:17.986
Well, what girl wouldn't be
seduced by all this?

10:21.330 --> 10:24.538
— Seriously, Davis, this place is a shithole.
— (Door opens)

10:24.917 --> 10:26.623
(Door slams)

10:37.679 --> 10:39.465
Ah!

10:44.728 --> 10:48.812
Three of the furious five on duty
and on call, I salute you!

10:48.941 --> 10:51.683
— Hey, hey!
— I thought you weren't gonna make it.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.434
Oh! You mock me, sir.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.357
If you persist in doing so,
I will have satisfaction.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.321
Be satisfied. It's all good.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.912
— You satisfied now?
— Aw, l'm playin' with you, dawg.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.082
"I will have satisfaction"
is like what a gentlemen says

11:13.215 --> 11:14.625
when he wishes to duel.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.259
You know, pistols at ten paces.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.341
I will have satisfaction.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.177
Ah! You say that shit,
then you slap the bitch with a glove!

11:21.306 --> 11:22.807
Bap!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.152
(Men) J‘ Baby used to stay out

11:38.282 --> 11:39.943
J‘ All night long

11:40.075 --> 11:42.111
J‘ She made me cry

11:42.244 --> 11:43.950
J‘ She done me wrong

11:44.079 --> 11:46.115
J‘ She broke my little heart

11:46.248 --> 11:48.364
J‘ But that's all right

11:48.500 --> 11:50.286
J‘ 'Cause the table's turned

11:50.419 --> 11:52.330
J‘ And now it's her turn to cry

11:52.462 --> 11:55.329
J‘ Because I used to love her

11:55.465 --> 11:58.127
J‘ But it's all over now

11:59.094 --> 12:00.675
Go.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.796
J‘ I said I used to love her

12:03.932 --> 12:06.548
J‘ But it's all over now J‘

12:06.685 --> 12:08.266
(All) Come on! Come on!

12:11.273 --> 12:14.106
Hey! Hey!

12:15.444 --> 12:18.356
Hey! Hey!

12:19.740 --> 12:20.274
Hey!

12:22.659 --> 12:26.117
— Uh, Jacques!
— Mademoiselle Desautel.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.453
It's so quiet. How can you work?

12:31.877 --> 12:33.242
(J‘ Music playing)

12:33.378 --> 12:35.994
- Where is everyone?
— Pedro's running late.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.089
— Wardell?
- lrene's.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.924
— Ten an hour.
— Dishwashing?

12:42.054 --> 12:44.921
Damn, things are outta whack.

12:45.057 --> 12:48.174
— What's your cousin doing? Raymond?
— I could call him.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.221
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.

12:52.356 --> 12:56.645
- What about Pedro?
— Oh, I'm so over Pedro.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.894
— The one I really miss is David.
— Daymo!

13:00.030 --> 13:02.442
— That's my boy.
— Ah! Oysters.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.530
See? lt's gettin' better.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.651
lt's oyster season. How bad could life be?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.368
Janette, it's half.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.201
That's not going to get us through the night.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.791
I could run to Dorignac's. They got crawfish.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.081
And we could parade naked
down Prytania Street too,

13:17.214 --> 13:22.550
but I'm not gonna do it. No fucking frozen
Chinese crawfish in my kitchen.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.714
Charmaine, she should be setting up.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.216
(Sighs)

13:30.352 --> 13:32.092
Fuck me.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.228
l was about to say she called.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.447
— And?
— She's not coming in.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.238
Fender bender on Canal.
Says she was distracted.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.362
We're all distracted.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.372
How's your house?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.712
Don't ask me about my house.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.926
Never thought I'd come back
to see even this much of it.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.348
This goddamn bridge.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.640
Gretna police standin' there
with their guns out,

14:19.776 --> 14:22.438
waiting to make us walk the hell back.

14:23.447 --> 14:26.280
And here we are, drivin' the other way
like it didn't even happen.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.490
You don't have to stay.

14:28.618 --> 14:32.110
Just drop me and turn around. I'll be fine.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.454
Drop you where exactly, Daddy?

14:40.589 --> 14:43.080
(J‘ Marching band playing in distance)

14:46.094 --> 14:49.006
(Woman) Whoo—ooh! Yeah!

14:49.139 --> 14:50.925
(Crowd chattering, clapping)

14:51.058 --> 14:53.140
(Music continues)

14:56.980 --> 14:59.517
(Trombone playing solo)

15:35.018 --> 15:37.009
— (Music stops)
— (All cheering)

15:39.856 --> 15:41.687
Cold beer.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.808
Nice to see you too.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.689
Get me a shot of good whiskey, son.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.358
Y'all hangin' out? Go get three.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.321
— You know what I'm saying?
— Give me one.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.034
— One day with no panic attacks!
- Coming back at you, man!

15:54.162 --> 15:56.153
(J‘ Music playing over speakers)

15:56.915 --> 16:00.453
Man, you gotta put those stinky dogs away,
man. Nobody want to smell that.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.291
Man, I'm like to die here, fool.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.208
Thought you could hang, huh? Thought you
was gonna teach us young'uns something?

16:06.341 --> 16:07.751
Oh, yeah. Oh, hell yeah.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.091
That note he was looking for
on the last chorus?

16:10.220 --> 16:12.711
— The high note?
— What note was that, maestro?

16:12.848 --> 16:15.385
— What the fuck came out your horn, man?
- Fuck you, man.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.382
Was definitely a clam I heard.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.350
Now see here. I came up flat

16:19.479 --> 16:22.266
'cause y'all decided to end the damn parade
at my ex—wife's joint.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.481
A man can only take so much shit
in his stride.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.065
You two were married?

16:26.194 --> 16:28.981
- A long time ago.
— Man, how you let that slip away?

16:29.114 --> 16:30.570
Let me? Shit.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.985
l busted out of that situation.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.155
What went wrong? He wasn't treatin' you
like I would be treatin' you?

16:36.288 --> 16:38.324
— Wanna know what went wrong?
— Tell it, darlin'.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.698
— Tell it.
— I married a goddamn musician.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.042
Ain't no way to make that shit right.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.538
- Ooh!
— (All) Damn!

16:47.674 --> 16:49.585
Y'all don't even know.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.963
The explosion people heard
was actually an unsecured barge

16:56.099 --> 16:58.841
ramming into the canal wall,
not dynamite.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.389
(British accent) People think there was
a conspiracy to breach the levees.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.601
To what end?

17:02.731 --> 17:05.768
Drown 80% of the city?
In whose interest was that?

17:05.901 --> 17:09.564
Why displace so many working—class folks,
black and white?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.687
It makes no sense.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.779
Are you saying this was a natural disaster,

17:13.909 --> 17:16.571
— pure and simple?
— A natural disaster?

17:16.703 --> 17:19.115
— A hurricane is.
— What hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast

17:19.247 --> 17:21.989
was a natural disaster,
a hurricane, pure and simple.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.457
The flooding of New Orleans

17:24.586 --> 17:27.623
was a man—made catastrophe,

17:27.756 --> 17:30.714
a federal fuck—up of epic proportions,

17:30.842 --> 17:32.628
— and decades in the making.
- Daddy!

17:32.761 --> 17:35.798
— We can edit that out, no worries.
— The levees were not blown.

17:35.931 --> 17:39.640
Not in '65 and not three months ago.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.759
The flood protection system

17:41.895 --> 17:43.635
built by the Army Corps of Engineers,

17:43.772 --> 17:46.138
aka the federal government, failed.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.687
And we've been saying for the last 40 years,
since Betsy,

17:49.819 --> 17:52.401
that it was gonna fail again
unless something was done.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.066
And guess what? It was not.

17:54.199 --> 17:57.157
— Seriously, Daddy, you're gonna stroke out.
— No worries, sweetheart.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.492
Cool as a cucumber
up an archbishop's ass.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.202
The levees weren't blown.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.744
The floodgates failed, the canal walls failed,
the pumps failed.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.913
All of which were supposedly built
to withstand a much greater storm.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.662
— Are you suggesting criminal liability?
- Absolutely.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.835
Find the responsible parties,
put 'em on trial.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.459
Corps of Engineers,
federal, state, local government,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.677
the contractors who used
substandard materials

18:17.806 --> 18:21.344
and the goddamn sleazebag politicians
that they have in their pockets.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.432
So, given that it's all gone pear—shaped,

18:23.561 --> 18:26.928
why should the American taxpayer
foot the bill to fix New Orleans?

18:27.065 --> 18:28.305
It's going to cost billions.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.103
Well, since when don't nations
rebuild their great cities?

18:31.236 --> 18:35.855
For the sake of argument,
let's say New Orleans was once a great city.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.448
Are you saying
that New Orleans is not a great city?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.953
A city that lives in the imagination
of the world?

18:41.079 --> 18:42.944
l suppose...if you're a fan of the music,

18:43.081 --> 18:45.197
which has rather seen its day,
let's be honest.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.574
Or the food, a provincial cuisine

18:47.711 --> 18:50.999
which many would say is typically American,
too fat, too rich...

18:51.131 --> 18:53.713
Then yes, of course.
New Orleans has its advocates,

18:53.842 --> 18:55.582
but what about the rest of the country?

18:57.095 --> 18:58.585
Hm.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.883
(Clears throat) Hm.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.302
Provincial, passe,

19:03.435 --> 19:05.551
hate the food, hate the music, hate the city.

19:05.687 --> 19:09.430
What the fuck are you doing down here?
You fucking Limey vulture motherfucker!

19:09.566 --> 19:10.601
Oh!

19:13.028 --> 19:16.065
— (Chuckles) Really, you can'tjust...
— This is goin' in too.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.813
— Come on, God damn it!
— You go, Daddy.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.362
— Into the river!
— Let's just finish this in a civilized manner.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.576
I'm just going to take it for a little swim.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.320
Come on!

20:44.702 --> 20:46.693
(Truck rumbling past)

21:05.640 --> 21:07.346
You can't stay here, Daddy.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.887
— I hate this. Why did we even...
- Just wait.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.853
When the insurance settles...

21:13.982 --> 21:15.847
(Helicopter overhead)

21:15.984 --> 21:17.975
(Squishing)

21:22.574 --> 21:24.690
Daddy?

21:30.665 --> 21:32.656
Daddy?

22:04.699 --> 22:06.781
Take me to Miro Street.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.901
You mean Poke's?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.707
— (Man) What's up?
- What's up?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.755
(Man) We need something
for those mealybugs.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.550
(2nd man) Uh, sure. Pick up some coleus...

22:29.682 --> 22:32.059
— There he is.
— (1st man) Oh.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.968
(Men continue chatting)

22:43.571 --> 22:46.779
— Mm.
— (J‘ Plays loud riff)

22:58.253 --> 23:00.244
(J‘ Hip—hop playing loudly)

23:51.806 --> 23:53.762
(Fly buzzing)

25:01.125 --> 25:03.411
(J‘ Hip—hop continues)

25:03.544 --> 25:06.377
(J‘ Classical music blaring)

25:22.480 --> 25:26.018
(Volume increases,
drowning out classical music)

25:34.909 --> 25:37.776
(Hip—hop and classical music
continue blaring)

25:41.958 --> 25:44.074
(Bird chirping)

25:49.298 --> 25:52.005
(J‘ Piano playing, hesitant)

26:03.104 --> 26:05.516
— Hey, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

26:05.648 --> 26:08.264
Don't stop. It sounds good. Where's Daddy?

26:08.401 --> 26:10.642
In the study, getting ready
for a phone interview.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.565
Another one?
How'd it go on the levee today?

26:13.698 --> 26:15.734
— Daddy rocked.
— Oh, no.

26:15.867 --> 26:19.780
I didn't hit anyone.
I would have, but I couldn't catch 'em.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.037
— Was it live?
- No.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.578
Daddy threw the guy's microphone
into the canal.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.827
He tried for the camera,
but they fought him pretty hard on that one.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.874
They're Brits, they'll never use it.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.838
— Well, why wouldn't they?
- They might.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.503
It was pretty, wasn't it, Sof?

26:34.635 --> 26:36.216
— (Phone ringing)
- Oh.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.006
— Who's this one with?
- NPR.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.800
— Uh...
— It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.470
It's NPR. They get it.
NPR, the N stands for "nuance."

26:44.437 --> 26:45.927
(Phone continues ringing)

26:46.063 --> 26:48.099
(Creighton) Hello.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.518
- How many F-bombs?
— (Creighton) Yeah, I'm here.

26:50.651 --> 26:55.270
Five or six. And that thing he likes to say
about the archbishop and the cucumber.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.398
(Chuckles, groans)

26:59.869 --> 27:01.780
How's school, hm?

27:01.913 --> 27:05.371
I hate Baton Rouge.
I hate it more than words can say.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.037
Oh, it's just for another few weeks.

27:08.169 --> 27:11.707
— The girls must be nice, huh?
- The girls are not nice.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.454
They're so, like...

27:14.842 --> 27:17.003
The exact opposite of nice.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.047
You'll be back in time for Carnival.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.842
— Christ, I hope so.
— Sofia Bernette!

27:21.974 --> 27:24.716
Catholic school. It's ruining me.

27:24.852 --> 27:28.390
(Creighton) No... No, it's not!
The old city was built

27:28.523 --> 27:31.811
on a natural levee on the high ground.

27:32.777 --> 27:36.736
No, that's not true.
That's a misconception, a myth, a canard.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.775
(Whispers) Fucking NPR.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.821
The old city is not below sea level,
it never has been.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.236
That's because the media —

27:45.373 --> 27:48.831
and all due respect to your program,
but you are one of the worst offenders —

27:48.960 --> 27:51.918
likes a simple narrative
that they and their listeners

27:52.046 --> 27:53.911
can get their tiny brains around.

27:55.383 --> 27:58.841
Who are you or anybody else to say
which neighborhoods should come back?

27:58.970 --> 28:00.551
(Sofia) He's about to blow.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.841
- I know.
— Hell yes, it's worth saving!

28:02.974 --> 28:05.181
The whole damn thing!

28:05.309 --> 28:09.552
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You mean the federally—induced disaster?

28:09.689 --> 28:11.805
This is not a natural disaster.

28:11.941 --> 28:16.230
This is a man—made fucking catastrophe
of epic proportions!

28:16.362 --> 28:18.853
And, yeah, go ahead,
bleep the whole goddamn thing!

28:18.990 --> 28:21.527
What do I care? We're dying down here!

28:24.245 --> 28:27.908
- (Beeps)
— This ain't Lake Wobegon, God damn it.

28:30.918 --> 28:33.751
Oh! Red beans and rice.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.962
And it ain't even Monday. (Chuckles)

28:36.090 --> 28:37.421
Thank you, baby.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.387
— How your mama and them?
- Makin' do.

28:45.516 --> 28:46.847
Mm.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.183
She still tore up about Daymo, you know?

28:50.521 --> 28:52.682
Mm.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.101
Nothing? No word still?

28:56.944 --> 28:58.855
Damn.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.979
(Helicopters overhead)

29:02.158 --> 29:05.241
— The good dentist?
- Good.

29:06.996 --> 29:09.157
He comin' down here or you goin' up there?

29:09.290 --> 29:11.531
Most weekends, I go up there.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.333
How his practice goin' up there?

29:15.463 --> 29:18.500
Mm. He got a lot of his old patients.

29:19.383 --> 29:23.376
— He comin' back?
— Not to New Orleans East again, he does.

29:23.512 --> 29:26.128
That building's a teardown for sure.

29:28.851 --> 29:32.719
— Spoke to Alcide the other night.
— You could come see him.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.059
Said he got a B on his algebra.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.854
Yeah, he doin' good. Randall too.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.772
I ain't got no wheels, LaDonna.

29:40.905 --> 29:45.695
Now, what's wrong with the bus they got
running up to Baton Rouge, huh?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.282
Free ride, you got no excuse.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.902
You know I got gigs on the weekends,
what gigs there are.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.654
Go see 'em during the week.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.749
They miss you, especially with me
comin' down here all the time,

29:54.877 --> 29:56.333
both of us gone, you know what I'm saying?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.168
I miss them too.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.679
I miss our routine.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.091
— (Groans, mutters)
- (Chuckles)

30:10.851 --> 30:12.887
— I'm just sayin'.
—(Laughs)

30:13.020 --> 30:16.729
— Yeah, I know you just sayin'.
- You know we could...

30:16.857 --> 30:18.939
(Both laugh)

30:19.986 --> 30:23.979
Well, he up there, you down here.
Who would know?

30:25.866 --> 30:27.857
I would, baby.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.609
I would know.

30:35.376 --> 30:37.367
Better be goin', me.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.881
Tell the boys I'll give 'em a call.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.881
You better.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.720
|wi||.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.556
(Dogs barking)

31:01.569 --> 31:05.232
— (Sighs)
— (Train horn)

31:09.577 --> 31:12.410
— We gotta get that pork chop cleared.
— All right.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.871
Oh, that's pretty.
Take a picture of that, man.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.457
— Two minutes on this, Jacques.
- Workin' it.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.247
I need two pecan tarts.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.119
- We ran out.
— Well, what's left?

31:22.256 --> 31:24.463
— Lemon ice.
— And if they don't want lemon ice?

31:24.592 --> 31:26.924
It's New Orleans, darlin'.
Everybody wants lemon ice.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.294
You think I don't deal with
that kind of thing every day?

31:29.430 --> 31:32.672
No doubt. A little more anger
might be good for you too.

31:32.808 --> 31:36.300
Yeah, but is it going to do your argument
any good? That's what I'm asking.

31:36.437 --> 31:40.146
Vinegar, no flies.
lt's honey gets the job done.

31:40.274 --> 31:44.984
A big—ass fly swatter,
that's what fucks up the flies, darlin'.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.773
What's all this about flies?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.817
— Not in my place, I hope.
— Oh, of course not.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.986
— Our dinner was flyless. Flawless, as well.
— Thanks.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.576
— You're busy tonight.
— Oh, every night.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.242
I could stay open till midnight every night
if I had the staff.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.114
What do people in this town crave now?

31:59.251 --> 32:02.493
Good food, companionship, community.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.621
Mm, I crave dessert, myself.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.624
I'm out of everything but lemon ice.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.966
Sold.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.711
— Can't eat lemon ice.
— What? It's homemade.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.839
— It would be disloyal.
— He's waiting for Brocato's to reopen.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.261
Oh, I understand that.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.645
How about a Hubig's?

32:18.771 --> 32:20.727
Hubig's? What flavor?

32:20.856 --> 32:23.017
Uh, apple, for sure, maybe sweet potato.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.687
Ooh, sweet potato if you got it,
apple if you ain't.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.651
- OK.
— Hey, how's your house?

32:27.780 --> 32:30.396
Oh, don't ask me about my fuckin' house.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.364
(Creighton) Aww.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.529
Hello. Everything OK?

32:34.662 --> 32:37.654
— (Man) So, can I comp the salad?
— Whatever.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.916
— Hubig's?
— Dress it up, baby.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.588
Drizzle something on it.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.353
(Grunts)

33:10.030 --> 33:12.362
(Breathing heavily)

33:22.793 --> 33:25.785
(Helicopters overhead)

33:38.017 --> 33:40.303
He in the bar, Del.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.597
He livin' in the goddamn bar.

33:42.730 --> 33:46.018
He all up in there right now
tossing shit around, acting a fool.

33:46.150 --> 33:49.438
He got no business even being
in New Orleans right now.

33:49.570 --> 33:52.858
You don't think I've been tellin' him that
since before we left Houston?

33:52.990 --> 33:55.481
Maybe he just needed to see for himself,
you know?

33:55.618 --> 33:57.358
I've got to be at work in the morning.

33:57.494 --> 34:00.452
I ain't got time to hang around here
waitin' for him.

34:00.581 --> 34:04.494
You need to come down here and talk
some sense into him. I know I can't.

34:04.627 --> 34:07.084
All right, I'll be down there.

34:07.213 --> 34:11.047
- (Man whistles)
— Tell Don I'm one for Bird.

34:12.468 --> 34:13.958
Look, I got gigs, Davina.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.961
I'm in New York couple more days,
then I'll be in Boston on Wednesday.

34:17.097 --> 34:20.305
We all got gigs, Delmond.
Life is a goddamn gig.

34:20.434 --> 34:23.926
Me? I'm not even going to get home tonight
till damn near two in the morning.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.974
Well, what ya even
drive him over there for, Davina?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.142
Damn, boy, this is our dad
we're talkin' about.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.938
When you ever know anybody to change
his mind about any goddamn thing?

34:32.071 --> 34:34.687
- And you think I can?
— I think it's your turn to try.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.314
— All right. I'll be down.
— When?

34:37.451 --> 34:40.864
As soon as I can.
I've got to move a couple of things around.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.405
All right. Bye.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.753
(J‘ Fats Domino singing Do You Know
What It Means To Miss New Orleans)

34:51.882 --> 34:54.464
— I hate that fucking song.
— (Music stops)

35:01.267 --> 35:03.258
(J‘ Band playing lively tune)

36:07.499 --> 36:09.080
Try the main line, Jojo.

36:09.209 --> 36:12.167
— See, I think your wrench is broke...
- Miss La-Dee! Hey!

36:12.296 --> 36:14.378
Boy! Where you been?

36:14.506 --> 36:18.215
- Oh! You home?
— No, ma'am. Not yet.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.461
— Still in Memphis with my uncle and them.
- They coming back, right?

36:21.597 --> 36:24.589
Don't know. He found work out there.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.057
I tried to come for the parade today,
you know?

36:27.186 --> 36:29.598
— Car broke down near Manchac.
- Ooh!

36:29.730 --> 36:32.688
- So I ain't get back in time.
— Well, you here now. What you drinking?

36:32.816 --> 36:36.684
A Bud. How Daymo doing? He second line?

36:38.572 --> 36:41.564
- He ain't still locked up, is he?
— Locked up? What you mean?

36:41.700 --> 36:43.440
Daymo locked up in the storm.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.863
At OPP? You seen him?

36:45.996 --> 36:50.410
We was up on Broad Street Bridge together
all the damn day after the jail flood.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.249
I thought we was going to die.

36:53.379 --> 36:56.337
So Daymo ain't home yet?

36:56.465 --> 36:59.298
Demetrius, I ain't seen
my brother since the storm.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.803
None of us have.

37:01.929 --> 37:04.011
(Radio) That's the king on WWOZ.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.721
And the emperor, Ernie K—Doe.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.139
(Ernie on tape) I don't know what's wrong
with him, but the nurses and the doctors

37:11.271 --> 37:12.977
and the people that went in there

37:13.107 --> 37:16.520
with the yelling, with the screaming,
with the hollering...

37:16.652 --> 37:18.643
Jeffy Jeff, what up, my negro?

37:18.779 --> 37:22.237
- Davis McAlary.
— K—Doe rides again, huh?

37:22.366 --> 37:25.233
Mm, yeah, a little Ernie rant
to finish out a show.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.781
Yeah, master of the universe. Hey, so, dig...

37:27.913 --> 37:31.201
I'm not hung over, I'm all psyched
because of a post—sex,

37:31.333 --> 37:34.825
post—marijuana dream had me talking
to the ghost of Earl King last night,

37:34.962 --> 37:37.294
who gave me the exact theme for my show.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.754
Earl's doing good, by the way.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.168
— That's good to know.
- Yeah, in heaven,

37:41.301 --> 37:43.917
the horn players don't make him tune down
to E—flat to play Big Chief,

37:44.054 --> 37:45.260
so he's got that workin' for him.

37:45.389 --> 37:49.302
But, um, anyway, so Earl comes at me
with this political relevance,

37:49.435 --> 37:51.767
which is weird because
Earl wasn't that way in life.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.556
But hey, it's my dream, right?

37:53.689 --> 37:55.805
— And Earl brings it.
- Brings what?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.852
The Mafia.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.566
The Mafia? That's your theme?

37:59.695 --> 38:01.105
Dude!

38:01.238 --> 38:03.854
The Mafia is way better equipped
to run New Orleans

38:03.991 --> 38:05.481
than the United States government,

38:05.617 --> 38:07.573
— the State of Louisiana...
— They used to run it.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.443
The Marcellos used to run it all.

38:09.580 --> 38:12.993
Yeah, and fuck if it isn't time
to bring 'em back!

38:13.125 --> 38:16.993
I mean, hey, do you think the mob would
have dragged ass the way FEMA did

38:17.129 --> 38:19.620
and left little old ladies to rot on rooftops?

38:19.756 --> 38:21.212
I mean, look how good Carlos ran things

38:21.341 --> 38:23.753
when the mayor and the governor
was in his pockets.

38:23.886 --> 38:26.719
Look at the Lafitte.
Beautiful Sicilian roof slate.

38:26.847 --> 38:29.088
— Did they fall over? Did they flood?
— But music...

38:29.224 --> 38:33.638
Louis Armstrong, managed by Joe Glazer
who had to pair up with the mob, feel me?

38:33.770 --> 38:37.137
From there I segue into Louis Prima,
who was managed by the Segreto family.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.606
After which, I'm close enough
to some old—school R&B,

38:39.735 --> 38:43.193
get up into Cosimo's shop,
start spinning some Ray Charles,

38:43.322 --> 38:46.359
some Spiders, Lee Allen,

38:46.492 --> 38:48.028
may...

38:49.244 --> 38:52.407
Oh, you have got to be fucking kidding me!

38:52.539 --> 38:56.748
One in every three songs
from a pledge—drive compilation?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.913
It's that time of year, bro.

38:59.046 --> 39:00.456
Well...

39:00.589 --> 39:04.673
Here we are, supposedly
the greatest alternative radio station

39:04.801 --> 39:08.760
in the greatest musical city
in the sad, failed history of the planet

39:08.889 --> 39:11.551
and we're playing the same,
admittedly great, 20 tunes

39:11.683 --> 39:14.220
that everyone hears
on every fucking Big Easy,

39:14.353 --> 39:17.595
Crescent City, Care Forgot
compilation ever released?

39:17.731 --> 39:20.222
The fucking New Orleans fucking canon?

39:20.359 --> 39:21.565
— Fuck me!
— Yeah.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.604
And you gotta plug the CD at every break.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.604
— Darnell said so.
— lko, Tipitina...

39:26.740 --> 39:29.823
They All Asked For You,
yeah, yeah, fucking yeah!

39:29.952 --> 39:32.489
Fuck Darnell Nichols

39:32.621 --> 39:35.237
and his fucking pledge drive!

39:35.374 --> 39:37.660
(Ernie on tape) For true? For real?

39:37.793 --> 39:40.785
For the love of God, already. Fuck!

39:40.921 --> 39:43.253
- You know...
— (Ernie's voice stops)

39:43.382 --> 39:45.873
Shit.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.349
And I'm here.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.059
Sorry.

39:58.188 --> 40:01.726
Yeah, DJ Davis. Uh, check this out.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.775
(J‘ Louis Prima singing Buona Sera)

40:11.994 --> 40:15.077
(Song continues)

40:29.970 --> 40:32.131
(Song continues)

41:02.210 --> 41:04.201
(Humming along with song)

41:10.344 --> 41:13.177
(Song continues)

43:03.707 --> 43:05.663
Hm.

43:08.378 --> 43:09.959
(Groans)

43:42.704 --> 43:44.820
(Music playing on radio)

44:01.848 --> 44:03.713
(Chuckling)

44:05.936 --> 44:10.851
- Boy, I knew you'd come back.
— Yeah. I knew you'd never leave.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.849
You know it'd take more than a hurricane
to pry me outta New Orleans.

44:13.985 --> 44:17.398
So, what? Beer? Gin? Juice?
What you need?

44:17.531 --> 44:19.396
— Water, son.
- Water?

44:19.533 --> 44:20.898
I could use a bath.

44:21.034 --> 44:23.400
Boy, done had water in this neighborhood
two weeks now.

44:23.537 --> 44:26.074
— Where you stayin' at?
- Around the corner.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.572
What? Poke's bar?

44:28.708 --> 44:31.085
Seem Poke need to pay his water bill.

44:31.211 --> 44:33.042
(Laughing)

44:33.171 --> 44:35.412
Come on, man. Come on in here.

44:35.549 --> 44:37.085
Hey, baby, look who here!

44:37.217 --> 44:39.424
(Dull thud)

44:42.722 --> 44:44.053
(Groans)

44:59.781 --> 45:01.521
Shit.

45:20.260 --> 45:22.251
Aw, Desiree!

45:24.723 --> 45:26.429
God damn it.

45:27.767 --> 45:29.018
(Sighs)

45:34.774 --> 45:36.935
— (J‘ Hums)
— (Davis) So, finally, I pick up the phone.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.650
It's been ringing off and on
for the first two hours of the show.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.235
Bitch—ass motherfucker is all,

45:41.364 --> 45:43.571
"Didn't you get the memo
for the pledge—drive playlist?"

45:43.700 --> 45:46.442
And I'm all, "Yes, I did receive
your correspondence, sir,

45:46.578 --> 45:49.945
"but I felt compelled to regard it
as musically and creatively invalid."

45:50.081 --> 45:52.333
You don't say. So what did he say to that?

45:52.459 --> 45:55.951
— (J‘ Music playing over speakers)
- Cocksuckers!

45:59.299 --> 46:02.336
— (Guard) Hey, hey! Where you going?
- Uh, who's in charge here?

46:02.469 --> 46:04.300
— Hey, you can't be here.
— What's up, Davis?

46:04.429 --> 46:06.385
— What's up?
— They're liquidating this location.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.095
Everything's going in the truck.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.180
— Are they paying you?
— Two more days and that's it.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.141
— (Guard) Hey, we're closed.
— Hey.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.477
- What's the problem?
— Uh, you have my music.

46:14.606 --> 46:16.187
My old band. Uncut Funk.

46:16.316 --> 46:19.058
Six copies each of the two CDs
here on consignment.

46:19.194 --> 46:22.106
Uh, Armstrong Park
and New Orleans Nasty.

46:22.238 --> 46:23.853
Either that or you have money for me.

46:23.990 --> 46:26.857
— Fella, this store, it's out of business.
— Oh, well, | just want my music.

46:26.993 --> 46:30.577
Look, there's nothing we can do.
The inventory gets sent to New York.

46:30.705 --> 46:35.039
Let us... Dude. Let us pause, sir,
and define the word "consignment."

46:35.168 --> 46:37.875
Consignment means shit be mine

46:38.004 --> 46:40.711
and if y'all sell it, y'all break me off a piece.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.707
— And if you don't, give it the fuck back.
- We're out of business.

46:43.843 --> 46:47.051
OK, are you gonna jack my shit
because you can't handle yours, man?

46:47.180 --> 46:50.217
— Toss him.
— Fuck you, man. Fuck you, you pussy fucks!

46:50.350 --> 46:52.432
You come down here
with your chain—store shit, huh?

46:52.560 --> 46:56.098
Fuck you for running away
at the first fucking hurricane!

46:56.231 --> 46:59.064
Louisiana Music Factory
is gonna make every fucking dollar

46:59.192 --> 47:01.478
that you'll never see, you pussy fucks!

47:01.611 --> 47:03.226
— (Guard) Come on!
- Fuck you.

47:03.363 --> 47:04.853
Fuck!

47:04.990 --> 47:06.855
I'm out!

47:06.992 --> 47:08.653
- (Grunts)
— (Man) What the fuck?

47:08.785 --> 47:11.527
— (Men snickering)
- (Door slams)

47:13.999 --> 47:16.240
I will have satisfaction.

47:16.376 --> 47:17.741
(Man) Get your stupid ass up.

47:17.877 --> 47:20.539
No, you pick up where we left off yesterday.

47:20.672 --> 47:23.539
You want 4800 America,
and go all the way to Pressburg.

47:23.675 --> 47:25.666
— (Driver) Yes, sir.
- Go on.

47:30.598 --> 47:32.429
Mm.

47:32.559 --> 47:34.595
Not so many back over here, huh?

47:34.728 --> 47:36.639
Water was up to your waist
in most of these shotguns.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.762
People waitin' on insurance. Those that got.

47:38.898 --> 47:41.765
— Well, you got yours squared away.
— Me? I'm making money.

47:41.901 --> 47:46.110
$200 every truckload | clear
off them New Orleans East streets.

47:46.239 --> 47:48.321
— That's FEMA contract.
- FEMA, huh?

47:48.450 --> 47:52.659
Mm—hm. It ain't good for most, but if you
got a haulin' business, it's good enough.

47:52.787 --> 47:55.574
Speaking of which, I got a ton of muddy shit

47:55.707 --> 47:58.619
l hauled out of the bar room
need to be dumped.

47:58.752 --> 48:00.993
— Shit.
— l'm askin' as a chief here.

48:02.172 --> 48:07.633
Albert, all due respect...you ain't my chief.
My chief Monk Boudreaux.

48:07.761 --> 48:10.093
I been Golden Eagle all my life.
You know that.

48:10.221 --> 48:13.338
Well, I need the bar room for practice.

48:13.475 --> 48:15.966
Ain't none of your gang even around.

48:17.270 --> 48:20.603
— Practice is Sunday.
— You out your damn mind.

48:20.732 --> 48:24.475
Every day I'm over at New Orleans East on
that government contract,

48:24.611 --> 48:26.852
I'm making six to 800 dollars.

48:26.988 --> 48:29.445
(Laughs) No, I'm sorry, homes.

48:38.166 --> 48:41.704
— Thanks for the beer.
- You welcome.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.122
Uh—huh. Yeah.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.169
No, no, no, I understand.

48:49.302 --> 48:52.465
I... No, you were smart to call,

48:52.597 --> 48:54.838
but I think your court date's been postponed.

48:54.974 --> 48:57.966
(Chuckles) I'll check and call you back.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.890
(Woman) Isn't that Toni Bernette?

49:06.027 --> 49:08.439
Hey, Rich. How's it going?

49:08.571 --> 49:10.857
— We're expecting someone.
- Oh.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.151
Sorry, I didn't realize.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.242
Meetin' someone anyway.
I guess I'll just wait for a table.

49:16.371 --> 49:18.111
You're workin' out of your car?

49:18.248 --> 49:22.617
— Office took about five feet of water.
— Ours too. How's your house?

49:22.752 --> 49:24.333
We're up on Octavia.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.293
— The isle of denial.
— (Chuckles)

49:26.422 --> 49:31.587
— We did lose our roof, but can't complain.
— No, you can't.

49:33.138 --> 49:35.675
- What about you?
— Still livin' on the fuckin' boat.

49:35.807 --> 49:37.138
Aw, I'm sorry.

49:38.685 --> 49:42.018
There's my date. I'll talk to you soon, Rich.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.560
— Who's joining us?
- Fuck that cunt.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.934
— It's not personal, Lonnie.
— Fuck it ain't.

49:49.070 --> 49:52.107
— She sues everybody.
- Whatever.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.275
What you got?

49:53.408 --> 49:55.615
So this boy come into the bar
after the parade.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.779
Demetrius Bray, Sylvie's brother,

49:57.912 --> 50:00.073
— from over on Pi...
— Excuse me.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.324
OK, but anyway,

50:04.460 --> 50:07.418
he say he was with Daymo at OPP

50:07.547 --> 50:09.754
when the jail was flooded.

50:09.883 --> 50:12.499
He says your brother was locked up
during the storm?

50:12.635 --> 50:15.012
He said they was together on the bridge

50:15.138 --> 50:19.256
before the buses came
and took them to St. Gabriel.

50:19.392 --> 50:21.053
And after that?

50:21.186 --> 50:23.222
He ain't see him again.

50:24.355 --> 50:28.064
LaDonna, I checked with NOPD,
the sheriff, OPP.

50:28.193 --> 50:31.777
They have no record of David,
no arrest, no report, nothing.

50:31.905 --> 50:33.611
Don't mean he wasn't there.

50:33.740 --> 50:35.901
You know that.

50:36.034 --> 50:40.118
The way they do up at the parish
even when there ain't a hurricane, Toni.

50:40.246 --> 50:43.613
I'll check again.
It's a good thing, LaDonna, huh?

50:43.750 --> 50:45.832
A place to start.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.451
Ain't gonna tell my mama about it this time.

50:48.588 --> 50:51.000
Don't want to get her
worked up about it again.

50:56.930 --> 50:59.091
I think he dead.

50:59.224 --> 51:02.307
— All this time and that boy ain't call?
- LaDonna...

51:02.435 --> 51:05.973
— No. He would have called if he could...
- We...

51:06.105 --> 51:09.518
No,no,no,no.
We don't know anything yet, all right?

51:09.651 --> 51:12.142
Give me a day or two to work on it, OK?

51:14.155 --> 51:16.146
Had no idea we'd have to wait like this.

51:16.282 --> 51:18.523
Yeah, well, I gotta get back to the bar.

51:19.494 --> 51:21.780
I'll call you, OK?

51:31.798 --> 51:33.288
(Waitress) There you go!

51:33.424 --> 51:35.631
I'll get up if your friend shows.

51:39.681 --> 51:41.888
(Toni) Whew!

51:42.725 --> 51:46.058
- What's wrong with him?
— You sued him, remember?

51:46.187 --> 51:49.350
— Oh.
— Brutality complaint last summer?

51:49.482 --> 51:52.645
(Woman) All right. Tell your mama
and them I said all right.

51:52.777 --> 51:54.517
— Hey, Rich.
—Hm?

51:54.654 --> 51:57.862
You remember a couple of months back
l was asking about a missing kid,

51:57.991 --> 52:01.028
— young man from Valence Street?
- A lot of people still missing.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.741
A lot of people want to be missing.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.861
— You ran his name.
— And got nothing.

52:04.998 --> 52:08.206
But do you think it's possible
he might have been locked up

52:08.334 --> 52:10.620
— just before the storm...
- Sure, it's possible.

52:10.753 --> 52:13.085
Anything's possible, you kidding?

52:13.214 --> 52:15.125
All I know is we don't have him.

52:15.717 --> 52:18.675
Let me ask you something, darlin'.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.839
This kid a fuck—up?

52:20.972 --> 52:24.931
I saw those priors. Theft, drugs, FTA's.

52:25.059 --> 52:27.095
He was doing better before the storm.

52:27.228 --> 52:29.389
Right. (Sighs)

52:29.522 --> 52:31.058
Humor me.

52:35.862 --> 52:38.228
David Maurice Brooks.

52:38.364 --> 52:40.320
Bread puddin'?

52:40.450 --> 52:44.409
Never mind brutality,
he ought to be sued over this right here.

52:44.537 --> 52:45.652
(Both laughing)

52:46.164 --> 52:47.779
Look, it's $24 right now, God damn it.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.906
I got you, bro. I got you covered.

52:50.043 --> 52:52.409
I'm leaving my damn 'bone, man.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.331
You know if I'm leavin' my 'bone
in your damn cab,

52:54.464 --> 52:56.921
I ain't runnin' out on you, shit.

52:59.010 --> 53:01.922
- 24!
— Whoa. Listen, that's another thing.

53:02.055 --> 53:04.922
I don't know about all that $24
from the parish line.

53:05.058 --> 53:06.639
If you had listened to me and taken Earhart,

53:06.768 --> 53:09.180
you wouldn't have run into
all that mess on Claiborne.

53:09.312 --> 53:10.472
Shit.

53:11.773 --> 53:14.014
Man, it's 24 or l'm—a call a cop.

53:14.150 --> 53:17.108
Come on now. Just calm down.
I'll be right back, bro.

53:18.363 --> 53:20.354
Hold on.

53:24.202 --> 53:26.113
Be right back.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.236
Yeah.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.949
Hey, now, Batiste, baby.

53:33.086 --> 53:34.951
How you doin', darlin'?

53:35.088 --> 53:36.373
l was worried y'all wasn't home.

53:36.506 --> 53:39.293
Kermit's out back. Where you been livin' at?

53:39.425 --> 53:41.381
Livin' out beyond the parish line.

53:41.511 --> 53:44.969
— Jefferson Highway.
— Uh—uh—uh. That ain't right.

53:45.098 --> 53:48.431
Yeah, I know. It's wrong and it's wrong.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.470
- Yeah.
— lt's wrong.

53:50.603 --> 53:53.891

53:54.023 --> 53:56.264
Oh, man!

53:56.401 --> 53:58.187
You live to barbecue.

53:58.319 --> 54:00.355

— Batiste in the house.

54:00.488 --> 54:01.978
— How you doing, man?
- How you doing?

54:02.115 --> 54:04.151
— What's up, D?
— Where you at?

54:04.283 --> 54:06.148
Yeah. You chained to that thing, huh?

54:06.285 --> 54:10.119
Oh. I'm a master chef.
I just play music on the side.

54:10.248 --> 54:11.954
(Laughs)

54:14.627 --> 54:18.666
- Y'all got a lot of water?
— Oh, not much. Less than a foot.

54:18.798 --> 54:20.459
- The Treme?
— (Scoffs) Yeah.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.923
— Not much.
— That's good.

54:23.970 --> 54:26.211
Good. Listen, Kermit.

54:26.347 --> 54:28.679
Uh, you still got that gig
at Vaughan's tonight, right?

54:28.808 --> 54:31.049
— You got that goin' again?
— Vaughan's still havin' it.

54:31.185 --> 54:34.018

— Comin' back slowly, but surely.

54:34.147 --> 54:36.308
— Yeah.
— lt's comin' back.

54:38.443 --> 54:41.025
— Listen, bro, uh...

54:41.154 --> 54:43.896
— Oh, brother, l'm hand to mouth.

54:44.031 --> 54:46.238
Come on down to Vaughan's

54:46.367 --> 54:47.948
— All right.
— Come on down tonight.

54:48.077 --> 54:52.195
All right. See, but the thing is,
can I get an advance on that shit?

54:52.331 --> 54:53.867
Taxi outside got my 'bone in it.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.991
(All laughing)

54:56.127 --> 54:58.368
He can't help it.

54:58.504 --> 55:00.290

55:41.214 --> 55:44.047
— Hey, you back?
— Not yet.

55:44.175 --> 55:47.292
— Man, you gotta come home, man.
— You know it.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.681
Thing is, he's not playing
anywhere nearby, I checked.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.937
I heard he's working
on a record with Toussaint.

55:57.063 --> 55:59.770
— All right, I'm gonna talk to the guy.
— Davis, don't fuck with the guy.

55:59.899 --> 56:01.935
He's just here to hear some music,
not to talk to you.

56:02.068 --> 56:06.232
Dude, he's at Vaughan's for Kermit.
This needs to be acknowledged.

56:10.868 --> 56:12.859
— What's happenin', man?
- What's happenin'?

56:12.995 --> 56:15.452
— You holdin' it down?
— Hey, Kermit.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.742
Oh, Davis.

56:18.376 --> 56:21.459
Do you know, uh...do you know
who this geeky—lookin' white guy is

56:21.587 --> 56:23.623
sitting over here with the glasses?

56:23.756 --> 56:26.247
That's that cat that writes
for the Times—Picayune, eh?

56:26.384 --> 56:28.124
What? No, man.

56:28.261 --> 56:30.343
That's Elvis Costello!

56:30.471 --> 56:32.007
- Elvis?
— Costello!

56:32.139 --> 56:34.551
He's a star, Kermit.
He's a fuckin' rock—'n'—rol| legend.

1:03:35.854 --> 1:03:39.438
(Woman) I told you to stay your ignorant ass

I will show you what hurt is.
Get in the goddamn car.

Can't keep my hours as it is, and I gotta

Most up—to—date list we have.

1:03:52.287 --> 1:03:54.744
Everyone who was at OPP
before the storm hit,

1:03:54.873 --> 1:03:57.580
— where they were sent, what parish...
— (Car starts)

1:03:57.710 --> 1:04:00.747
..whether they're still incarcerated
or been released.

1:04:00.879 --> 1:04:03.165
— This is everyone?
- Every last one.

1:04:04.049 --> 1:04:06.256
We don't have him, Tone.

1:04:06.385 --> 1:04:08.546
Never did.

1:04:08.679 --> 1:04:10.761
— Thanks for this.
— Any time.

1:04:14.226 --> 1:04:16.433
(Kermit) All y'all holdin' it down, huh?

1:04:18.439 --> 1:04:20.430
Have a good night.

1:04:20.566 --> 1:04:24.559
So, Davis, man, that boy's named Elvis?

1:04:24.695 --> 1:04:26.276
Kermit, you don't know Elvis Costello?

1:04:26.405 --> 1:04:29.147
Alison, Pump It Up,
Everyday I Write The Book.

1:04:29.283 --> 1:04:33.322
Come on, you're kidding, right, Kermit?
Jeez, brother, go talk to him.

1:04:35.164 --> 1:04:38.452
— About what?
— Music. Make a friend. Make a contact.

1:04:38.584 --> 1:04:42.293
"Kermit Ruffins opens for Elvis Costello
on his American tour."

1:04:42.421 --> 1:04:44.252
Who knows? Go.

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:47.293
— You know this boy Elvis?
- Mm-hm.

1:04:47.426 --> 1:04:49.542
Goddamn, Kermit. Go talk...

1:04:49.678 --> 1:04:51.669
You deserve...
Don't you want to get famous?

1:04:51.805 --> 1:04:55.468
You deserve to be famous.
America needs it some Kermit.

1:04:55.601 --> 1:04:59.389
You're...you're just standing there
telling me

1:04:59.521 --> 1:05:04.766
that all you wanna do is get high,
play...play some trumpet

1:05:04.902 --> 1:05:07.609
and barbecue in New Orleans
your whole damn life?

1:05:10.199 --> 1:05:11.609
That'll work.

1:05:11.742 --> 1:05:14.199
(All laughing)

1:05:15.996 --> 1:05:19.033
God, man. I mean, that's just so sad.

1:05:19.166 --> 1:05:22.658
This is against policy.
But you said the kid is still missing?

1:05:22.795 --> 1:05:25.537
- Yeah.
— An exception, then.

1:05:26.298 --> 1:05:28.584
Understood. And appreciated.

1:05:30.052 --> 1:05:33.010
We actually didn't get any photos
of the prisoners on the overpass.

1:05:33.138 --> 1:05:36.630
— But you can see it right from here.
- Couldn't get into our building.

1:05:36.767 --> 1:05:38.473
But the wires had some shots we picked up

1:05:38.602 --> 1:05:41.594
and ran on the website
before we were back in print.

1:05:41.730 --> 1:05:45.188
This screen and the next.
Just click to make any shot bigger.

1:05:47.319 --> 1:05:50.732
— (Phone ringing)
— Let me know if you need anything else.

1:05:51.698 --> 1:05:53.950
(Man) Times—Picayune. Walker.

1:05:56.161 --> 1:05:58.152
No, he's left for the night.

1:05:59.123 --> 1:06:00.954
OK.

1:06:10.509 --> 1:06:12.170
(TV on)

1:06:12.302 --> 1:06:15.669
(Man on TV) ..one of the best deals
we've ever had...

1:06:25.149 --> 1:06:27.356
From Baton Rouge. Older one.

1:06:29.444 --> 1:06:31.355
Alcide?

1:06:31.488 --> 1:06:34.651
- What did he want?
— Told him you had a gig.

1:06:36.451 --> 1:06:38.533
(Sighs)

1:06:42.875 --> 1:06:45.116
l was backin' up Kermit Ruffins

1:06:45.252 --> 1:06:47.368
at Vaughan's tonight.

1:06:47.504 --> 1:06:50.667
— You played with Kermit?
— He asked me.

1:06:51.925 --> 1:06:56.589
Yeah. And I'm leavin' this right here, girl,
knowin' that that last 50 is mine.

1:06:56.722 --> 1:07:01.056
Can't be takin' no bus into town
from Jefferson damn Parish.

1:07:02.519 --> 1:07:04.430
This'll cover the gas and electric.

1:07:04.563 --> 1:07:08.147
Another 30 could get our cable
turned on in here.

1:07:08.275 --> 1:07:09.936
Ah.

1:07:10.903 --> 1:07:12.894
(Groans)

1:07:15.032 --> 1:07:16.988
How are you talking me into this,
just for the record?

1:07:17.117 --> 1:07:21.076
— You're striking a blow for liberty.
— Yeah, I don't really give a fuck, actually.

1:07:21.205 --> 1:07:25.323
(Sighs) All right, then you're doing it
because we played JV soccer together,

1:07:25.459 --> 1:07:27.620
because I dated your sister
for three months.

1:07:27.753 --> 1:07:29.744
My sister says you're an asshole.

1:07:30.756 --> 1:07:33.589
Oh, yeah. I can see why she might.

1:07:33.717 --> 1:07:36.208
You know, if the cops come,
we're totally fucked.

1:07:36.345 --> 1:07:38.631
This is New Orleans, dawg.
The police never come.

1:07:38.764 --> 1:07:42.006
And if they do, they'll shove us out of the
way and start looting they own selves.

1:07:42.142 --> 1:07:45.305
It's a town of ornate and inviolate tradition.

1:07:45.437 --> 1:07:49.430
Three minutes, McAlary, that's it.
No fucking around!

1:07:49.566 --> 1:07:52.558
Come on! Dude, come on! Let's go!

1:07:56.323 --> 1:07:58.655
Oh! Pin Stripe Brass Band,
Live At Donna's.

1:07:58.784 --> 1:08:01.571
This goes with me
'cause, swear to God, uh,

1:08:01.703 --> 1:08:05.412
I played guitar on track seven, uncredited,
and never got a copy. Check it out.

1:08:05.540 --> 1:08:07.451
— Whatever, dude. Let's go.
- Closer Walk With Thee.

1:08:07.584 --> 1:08:09.449
Oh, fuck me! No.

1:08:10.629 --> 1:08:13.086
OK, The Genius Of Dave Bartholomew.

1:08:13.215 --> 1:08:16.503
All his Imperial recordings in a single set,
totally out of print.

1:08:16.635 --> 1:08:18.171
Dude, justice aside,

1:08:18.303 --> 1:08:21.466
this shit's karmatically mine
'cause mine got stolen from my car.

1:08:21.598 --> 1:08:22.929
Let's go.

1:08:27.229 --> 1:08:30.471
(Women chatting)

1:09:06.393 --> 1:09:08.384
(Helicopters overhead)

1:09:21.366 --> 1:09:24.278
— Where he at?
— I don't know.

1:09:26.455 --> 1:09:28.571
And why ain't he fuckin' call?

1:09:30.208 --> 1:09:32.620
(J‘ Music playing on radio)

1:09:36.923 --> 1:09:38.914
(Clears throat)

1:09:39.051 --> 1:09:41.258
What now?

1:09:51.229 --> 1:09:53.265
— What are you doing here?
- Hey, darlin'.

1:09:53.398 --> 1:09:55.059
Um, celebrating victory

1:09:55.192 --> 1:09:58.776
over the forces of, uh,
unfettered corporate arrogance.

1:09:58.904 --> 1:10:00.485
You opened a Conterno?

1:10:00.614 --> 1:10:03.151
For a small establishment,
you have an excellent list.

1:10:03.283 --> 1:10:07.492
A '98? A fucking '98 Conterno Monfortino.

1:10:07.621 --> 1:10:09.987
It's a remarkable year.
It's a remarkable wine.

1:10:10.123 --> 1:10:14.412
Huge aromas of tar, truffle,
roses, cocoa and licorice.

1:10:14.544 --> 1:10:18.287
Notes of, uh, mineral and leather,
sweet dark fruit.

1:10:18.423 --> 1:10:21.130
Super—fine elegant tannins,
finish that goes on forever.

1:10:21.259 --> 1:10:24.968
— It's one of the finest red wines in the world.
- It should be, at 350 a bottle.

1:10:25.097 --> 1:10:27.634
Retail. And a little overpriced,
if you don't mind my saying.

1:10:27.766 --> 1:10:29.757
— But I know you need the markup...
— What the fuck, Davis?

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:34.262
— Davis, what the fuck are you thinking here?
— l'm celebr... Oh, I can pay for it.

1:10:40.237 --> 1:10:42.319
Dave Bartholomew?

1:10:42.447 --> 1:10:44.312
We are not amused here.

1:10:44.449 --> 1:10:47.111
Darlin', you don't understand.

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:49.656
This is out of print.

1:10:49.788 --> 1:10:52.621
But I offer it to you freely as barter

1:10:52.749 --> 1:10:55.832
for this drink and fine repast
that must surely accompany it.

1:10:55.961 --> 1:10:58.168
And as you know,
I am deeply partial to your etouffee.

1:10:58.296 --> 1:11:00.958
Jacques, throw him the fuck out.

1:11:01.091 --> 1:11:03.298
What? You can't throw me out,
I'm your boyfriend!

1:11:03.427 --> 1:11:05.292
— What? No...
— Kinda.

1:11:05.429 --> 1:11:07.715
Though not specifically
or on a consistent basis.

1:11:07.848 --> 1:11:11.136
But still, you have to admit,
I am a very close friend.

1:11:11.268 --> 1:11:13.350
With benefits. You find me charming.

1:11:13.478 --> 1:11:15.685
Not so much. Fuck off, Davis.

1:11:15.814 --> 1:11:17.930
You're putting me out of business.

1:11:28.326 --> 1:11:31.489
You have him. You had him the whole time.

1:11:32.289 --> 1:11:34.621
Take some responsibility.

1:11:36.001 --> 1:11:38.208
I'm not leaving this office
till I see the sheriff.

1:11:38.336 --> 1:11:41.248
— Ma'am...
— I am not leaving until he sees these photos

1:11:41.381 --> 1:11:43.918
— and answers for them.
— Ma'am, the sheriff is in meetings.

1:11:44.050 --> 1:11:46.541
— I'll wait.
— Could be all day.

1:11:46.678 --> 1:11:48.339
I'll wait.

1:12:14.206 --> 1:12:15.946
(Albert) Let's go.

1:12:17.584 --> 1:12:20.041
Shove that all the way to the back.

1:12:20.170 --> 1:12:22.582
Who that?

1:12:22.714 --> 1:12:24.750
— (Chuckles)
— (Man) All this here too?

1:12:24.883 --> 1:12:27.420
- All of it.
— Welcome...

1:12:27.552 --> 1:12:29.292
to the City That Care Forgot.

1:12:29.429 --> 1:12:31.420
Hey, Daddy.

1:12:33.558 --> 1:12:35.059
Boy.

1:12:36.269 --> 1:12:39.761
I had to cancel a gig up in Boston,
come down here instead.

1:12:39.898 --> 1:12:41.559
Why?

1:12:42.984 --> 1:12:45.100
'Cause my daddy done lost his mind.

1:12:45.237 --> 1:12:47.193
True dat.

1:12:47.322 --> 1:12:48.732
So, you think you stayin'?

1:12:48.865 --> 1:12:50.401
No.

1:12:51.743 --> 1:12:54.234
- I know I am.
— In the bar, Daddy?

1:12:54.371 --> 1:12:58.364
Don't nobody around here seem to mind,
except you and your sister.

1:12:58.500 --> 1:12:59.956
— Daddy...
— Daddy, shit.

1:13:00.085 --> 1:13:01.950
If you're not gonna help us fill up
the goddamn truck,

1:13:02.087 --> 1:13:04.578
make yourself useful and go down
and pay the water bill.

1:13:04.714 --> 1:13:06.545
Get the pipes turned back on up in here.

1:13:06.675 --> 1:13:08.415
(Laughs)

1:13:08.552 --> 1:13:10.213
Wait, let me understand something.

1:13:10.345 --> 1:13:13.052
So, you thinkin' I changed plans,

1:13:13.181 --> 1:13:16.264
canceled gigs, came all the way
down here from New York City

1:13:16.393 --> 1:13:18.884
to pay the water bill
on a bar we don't even own?

1:13:25.402 --> 1:13:28.314
All right. I'm just checking.

1:13:29.614 --> 1:13:32.321
(Taxicab radio chatter)

1:13:35.453 --> 1:13:37.444
(Clattering)

1:13:46.464 --> 1:13:49.251
(News anchor) ..relocated to help
with St. Bernard Parish.

1:13:49.384 --> 1:13:53.093
At this time, there are about 7,000
permanent residents living in that parish.

1:13:53.221 --> 1:13:57.134
Before the storm, almost 70,000 people
called St. Bernard home.

1:13:57.267 --> 1:14:00.350
Very few homes in the parish
have electricity and utilities.

1:14:00.478 --> 1:14:04.312
Coming up in just a few minutes, we'll be
telling St. Bernard Parish residents

1:14:04.441 --> 1:14:07.899
how to tell if your utilities are on
even if you're not living at home.

1:14:08.028 --> 1:14:09.859
Well, tonight, customers in parts of...

1:14:09.988 --> 1:14:12.821
(Screaming) Sons of bitches!

1:14:12.949 --> 1:14:14.814
(Shrieks)

1:14:16.161 --> 1:14:17.822
(Growls)

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:20.366
Fuck every last one of 'em!

1:14:20.498 --> 1:14:24.616
— Fuck 'em!
— (SilvenNare crashing)

1:14:25.503 --> 1:14:26.367
Damn it!

1:14:26.504 --> 1:14:29.166
Now, you see, I told you I had but 20.

1:14:29.299 --> 1:14:31.460
— 26 on the meter, dawg.
- Oh, man.

1:14:31.593 --> 1:14:34.801
Hey, mama! Where ya at, baby?
I know that Geraldine.

1:14:34.929 --> 1:14:36.840
Mm. I believe I do too.

1:14:36.973 --> 1:14:38.588
You should've let me out at 20, bro.

1:14:38.725 --> 1:14:41.512
- I told you.
— Listen, you ain't tell me shit.

1:14:41.645 --> 1:14:43.306
Man, yes I did. This last six on you.

1:14:43.438 --> 1:14:46.555
Gimme the 20, brother.
Now get out the cab.

1:14:46.691 --> 1:14:49.023
(Groaning)

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:50.813
You ain't got to be like that, bro.

1:14:50.945 --> 1:14:53.402
Hey, give me a card,
l'll mail you the six. lwill.

1:14:53.531 --> 1:14:56.398
— Aw, go on, man. Like I'm a damn fool.

1:15:03.875 --> 1:15:05.615
— How you been makin' it?
— I'm good, man.

1:15:05.752 --> 1:15:07.743
— Tryin' to get from this world to the next.
— I hear ya.

1:15:07.879 --> 1:15:10.211
— Thanks for makin' it on short notice, man.
— Uh—huh.

1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:13.377
— Aaron took sick this morning, bro.
— Bro, look, I'm glad for the gig.

1:15:13.510 --> 1:15:15.421
- Got it.
— Who goin' home?

1:15:15.553 --> 1:15:17.930
— Bojack goin' home.
— Beau Jacques?

1:15:18.056 --> 1:15:21.344
- From over Algiers?
— No, man. Bojack from Gert Town.

1:15:21.476 --> 1:15:23.012
The one that played sax with Huey Smith?

1:15:23.144 --> 1:15:27.103
Naw, bro. The one who stole cars for the
motherfuckers down in St. Bernard Parish!

1:15:27.232 --> 1:15:29.348
You know, man. Miss Hattie nephew.

1:15:29.484 --> 1:15:31.099
- Huh?
— The big head motherfucker

1:15:31.236 --> 1:15:32.851
with the lazy eye.

1:15:32.987 --> 1:15:36.445
— That dude.
— Oh, yeah, yeah. I thought he been dead.

1:15:36.574 --> 1:15:38.155
No, he went to Houston after the storm.

1:15:38.284 --> 1:15:40.115
- Uh-huh.
— He fucked around and got himself

1:15:40.245 --> 1:15:42.657
shot to death in one of them
Telephone Road bars, man.

1:15:42.789 --> 1:15:44.950
— So, now he home to stay.
- Yeah, I heard that.

1:15:45.083 --> 1:15:47.825
It's 40 to the graveyard, right?
And 40 cakewalk back, right?

1:15:47.961 --> 1:15:49.292

- Benny Jones.

1:15:51.589 --> 1:15:53.545
Closer Walk to start.

1:15:53.675 --> 1:15:55.711

— Key you feel comfortable with, cuz?

1:15:55.844 --> 1:15:58.051
— l'll flat that B, Bunchy.

1:15:58.179 --> 1:16:00.135
— Play for that money, boys.
- All right.

1:16:00.265 --> 1:16:01.755
Play for it.

1:16:01.891 --> 1:16:03.927
(J‘ Band playing slow tune)
