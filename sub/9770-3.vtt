You should get one.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.711
Ooh, that is good.

[bell rings]

01:36.763 --> 01:39.098

01:39.182 --> 01:40.600
- I stopped to buy coffee.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.436
- No, she stopped
to steal my coffee.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.356
- Ooh! You guys,

Ooh, maybe it's him.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.115
You think it's him?
- Hey.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.700
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

01:57.784 --> 02:00.495
- I'm thinkin' it's not him.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.871
- Ok, this is the horoscope
for a Capricorn.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.373
You're not a Capricorn.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.126
- I know, but I liked this one
better than mine.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.211
Ooh, gimme.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.880

- Hey, did you guys finish the
homework last night?

02:15.301 --> 02:17.011
Because I got up to chapter 7
and completely fell asleep.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.471
- Hello, Chase!
- Um...

02:18.555 --> 02:19.013
oh, hi, Melissa.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.682
- Oh, Chase.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.058
Don't call me Melissa.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.852
Melissa sounds so serious.

02:23.935 --> 02:24.561
Call me Mel.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.188
CHASE: All right. Mel.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.439
MELISSA: I saved you a seat.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.236
- All right,
guess I'll be sitting here.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.571
- Mmmm.
How great is this coffee?

02:34.654 --> 02:37.574
- I wish I knew.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.200
- Good morning, students.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.785
Before we get started,

I've been asked
to read this announcement.

- I nominate Zoey.

ALL: Yeah.
- Huh?!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.508
What makes you think I--
- I second Zoey's nomination.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.135
- Yeah.
- Hold on a second.

02:57.218 --> 03:00.096
- All right, Zoey Brooks is
officially on the ballot.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.222
- Chase!

03:01.306 --> 03:02.724
- Sorry, Zo.
You're on the ballot.

03:02.807 --> 03:03.975
That means you gotta run.

03:04.058 --> 03:04.934
- Ok. Fine.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.352
I nominate Chase.

Hold up a minute.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.981

the nomination for Chase?

- No. No one does.

- I absolutely second
the nomination for Chase.

03:13.484 --> 03:14.402
- Melissa...

- Any more nominations?

No?

names to Mr. McClure,

03:20.700 --> 03:21.910
and I'll be back in a sec.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.330
- I don't wanna be
class president.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.915
- I don't either.

03:26.998 --> 03:27.457
- Ohh! Zoey, check out your
horoscope!

03:27.540 --> 03:29.626
It says,

03:29.709 --> 03:31.669
"You will win a major
competition."

03:31.753 --> 03:33.212
Is that freaky or what?

03:33.296 --> 03:34.380
- I'm not a Virgo!

03:34.464 --> 03:35.298
- Shh.

03:35.381 --> 03:35.840
Don't tell people.

Can you read my horoscope?

03:39.510 --> 03:41.054
I'm a Sagittarius.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.639
I'm a Sagittarius.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.389
- Of course you are.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.311
Why'd you nominate me?!

03:48.394 --> 03:49.812
- 'Cuz you nominated me!

03:49.896 --> 03:53.024
- Well, I happen to think that
you'd make a great choice

03:53.107 --> 03:54.233
for class president.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.235
- Ok, and I think <i> you</i> would.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.447
- Thanks, but, I mean, I don't
wanna run against you.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.281
- Oh, what's the matter?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.407
Afraid you're gonna lose?

04:01.491 --> 04:04.994
- No, I'm not afraid
I'm gonna lose.

04:05.078 --> 04:05.828
- Ohhh.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.163
So you think
you can beat me.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.247
- No! No.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.832
I mean, I don't
think I can beat--

04:09.916 --> 04:11.793
- Calm down,
I'm just playin' with ya.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.836
- Look, I'm just
worried 'cuz, you know,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.380
we're really good friends,
and I'm afraid that

04:15.463 --> 04:18.591
if we're running against each
other, you know,

04:18.675 --> 04:20.635
the competition might screw up
our friendship.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.012
- Ok. Then let's make a pact.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.263
- What kinda pact?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.349
- That no matter what happens
in this election,

04:26.432 --> 04:29.269
we both promise not to
let it affect our friendship.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.019
- Deal.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.271
[spits]
Spit shake.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.231
- Gross!

04:33.314 --> 04:34.565
- What, girls don't spit shake?

04:34.649 --> 04:35.233
- Not really!

MR. EDWARDS: Hello.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.069
- Oh, hey, Mr. Edwards.

04:38.152 --> 04:38.861
- I just heard that
both you two are running

04:38.945 --> 04:40.113
for class president.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.656
Zoey, good luck.
- Thanks.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.117
- Chase.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.202
- Uh, you don't wanna--
that's just, uhhh...

04:46.286 --> 04:47.370
- I don't want to know.

04:49.414 --> 04:49.455
Ugh.

Check this out.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.931
"Yo yo yo-ey,
vote for Zoey."

05:08.683 --> 05:09.851
What?
It's my fault

rhymes with your name?

- Hey, what do you guys...

05:12.854 --> 05:15.857

05:15.940 --> 05:17.316
ZOEY: Ok, where
did you get a picture

05:17.400 --> 05:17.900
of Chase wearing
a wedding dress?

05:17.984 --> 05:20.069
- I didn't.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.446
I took his head and
photo-docked it

05:21.529 --> 05:22.989
onto some girl's body.
- Why?

05:23.072 --> 05:24.866
- 'Cuz if you want
to win this election,

05:24.949 --> 05:27.118
you need to set yourself
apart from the other candidates,

05:27.201 --> 05:29.746
and the best way to do that
is to make people think

05:29.829 --> 05:31.372
your opponent's a weirdo.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.000
- Thanks, but I really don't
wanna win that way.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.461
- Hello, peers.

make some posters?

05:39.505 --> 05:39.922
- Sorry. I can't.

05:40.006 --> 05:40.923
- Why not?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.259
- Because...

05:43.342 --> 05:46.137
my future husband
has entered the race.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.306
- Who's he?

05:48.389 --> 05:49.766
- Mark del Figgalo.

05:49.849 --> 05:53.269
Is this the face
of a born leader or what?

05:53.352 --> 05:55.146
- [chuckles]
What.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.648
- In here, Mark!

06:00.860 --> 06:02.779
- Vote for me.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.197
I'll make things better.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.657
{\an5}Vote for me.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.076
I'll make things better.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.578
Vote for me.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.163
I'll make things better.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.749
- You can't buy
that kind of charisma!

06:16.918 --> 06:19.629
- Mark is running?

06:19.712 --> 06:21.798
- Mark's last name is
del Figgalo?!

06:23.549 --> 06:24.467
- It means "of the figs."

06:29.889 --> 06:31.265
- Hey.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.185
What's up future prez?

06:34.268 --> 06:37.146
Dude, it's gonna be so cool
when you win the election.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.397
- How's that?

06:38.481 --> 06:40.733
- 'Cuz being president
equals power.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.068
And power attracts girls.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.821
- And if Zoey wins?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.489
- Ain't gonna happen.

06:46.572 --> 06:46.864
- What makes you so sure?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.158
- Dude.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.284
She's a girl.

06:50.368 --> 06:50.701
- So?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.912
- So?

06:52.995 --> 06:54.205
PCA's always had
guy presidents.

06:54.288 --> 06:55.998
And that's not gonna change
if I can help it.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.127
- What does that mean?

06:59.210 --> 07:00.711
- It means...

07:00.795 --> 07:03.256
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

07:03.339 --> 07:04.632
to make sure you crush Zoey
in this election.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.135
- Ok, first of all,

07:07.218 --> 07:09.887
I don't wanna "crush" Zoey.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.848
I'm not even sure
if I wanna win.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.516
So don't help me, all right?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.017
- Ok, chill.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.936
If you don't want my help,
I won't help.

07:18.396 --> 07:18.646
- Good.

07:34.453 --> 07:37.415
- Ok, I should not eat this
chocolate cake.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.875
- Then why'd you take it?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.793
- Because I'm weak.
Here, Zoey, you have it.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.086
- No, I'm trying to be good.

07:42.170 --> 07:42.920
Lola, go for it.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.256
- Uh-uh.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.341
There's like a
billion calories in that thing.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.886
- All right, here's a plan.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.221
We all just take
one bite, 'kay?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.181
- Ok.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.307
- Just one.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.228
ALL: Mmm...

08:00.438 --> 08:02.148
- Ok one more.
- Right.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.357
- Just one.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.278
ALL: Mmm...

08:08.654 --> 08:09.572
- Hello.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.157
- What's wrong?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.784
- I've been collecting
polling data for the election.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.661
- Really?
- So how am I doin'?

08:15.745 --> 08:17.747
- You're doing fine.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.998
Here, I'll show you.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.086
See?
Zoey, you're the blue bar,

08:24.170 --> 08:25.713
and Chase is the red bar.

08:25.796 --> 08:26.797
- Wow, so we're
like almost tied?

08:26.881 --> 08:30.927
- Yep, you each have about
49% of the vote.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.929
- What's that little
green line down there?

08:33.011 --> 08:35.347
- Oh, that's Mark's bar.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.476
He's not doing so well.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.269
Poor, sweet baby.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.605
How can people
not be voting for him?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.023
Look at that face.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.402
- I dunno.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.111
- It's really weird.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.697
- Hey, you guys.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.991
If you go down to the quad,
you can get a free smoothie.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.036
And look, Chase's face
is on the side of the cup.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.789
- What?

08:59.872 --> 09:00.873
- Yeah, all right!

09:00.957 --> 09:02.333
- Awesome!
- Yeah!

09:02.416 --> 09:03.501
- This is rad.
- I want a free smoothie.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.462
- That's right, PCA students!

09:06.545 --> 09:07.463
Free smoothies!

09:07.546 --> 09:09.298
Compliments of Chase Matthews.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.261
Remember: A vote for Chase
is a vote for free smoothies!

09:13.344 --> 09:15.638
[students cheer]

09:15.721 --> 09:17.098
Oh, hey, Zoey.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.516
You votin' for Chase?

09:18.599 --> 09:19.767
- What are you doing?

09:19.850 --> 09:21.811
- Just gettin' out
the message.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.229
Vote for Chase!

09:23.312 --> 09:24.939
[students cheer]

09:25.022 --> 09:27.108
- Hey.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.487
- This is how you plan to win
the election?

09:31.570 --> 09:33.990
By giving out
free smoothies?!

09:34.073 --> 09:35.866
- I just heard about this.
- He just heard.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.742
- Well, I don't think
it's very fair.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.995
- Neither do I,
which is why

09:39.078 --> 09:40.663
I'm gonna go put a stop
to this right now.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.123
- Can I have another one?

09:42.206 --> 09:43.791
- Sure, have as many
as you'd like.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.042
- Um, I--I'm gonna follow him.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.253
- Uh-huh.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.171
- Right here.
- Smoothie, smoothie.

09:49.255 --> 09:53.467
LOGAN: Hey, here's Chase.
[students cheer]

09:53.551 --> 09:55.011
- What are you doing?!

09:55.094 --> 09:56.345
- Helping you get votes.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.680
- You said you weren't
gonna help me.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.806
- I know. I lied.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.016
- You lied?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.809
- Welcome to politics,
my friend.

10:01.892 --> 10:02.351
Here.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.352
Have a smoothie.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.980
- I don't want a smoothie!

10:06.063 --> 10:07.898
- It's mango.

10:07.982 --> 10:08.441
- Ooh, mango?

10:08.524 --> 10:10.192
- Gimme it.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.487
Here.
- Thanks.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.490
[overlapping chatter]

10:16.574 --> 10:17.867
- Can I get another one?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.368
- Man, this is better--
- Me, me, me, me.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.370
- Oh, right here!
- Come on, right here.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.205
- Listen, Zoey, I promise,
I'll make sure

10:23.289 --> 10:25.374
that Logan stops with
the whole free smoothie thing.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.584
- Whatever.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.209
- Listen, I really had nothing
to do with it.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.420
- Ok, people!

10:29.503 --> 10:31.047
What do you get
with Chase Matthews?!

10:31.130 --> 10:33.007
STUDENTS: Free smoothies!

10:33.090 --> 10:34.717
- And what do you
get with Zoey?!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.552
- Nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

10:36.635 --> 10:38.387
- Right! So who do you want
for class president?!

10:38.471 --> 10:40.890
STUDENTS: Chase! Chase!

10:40.973 --> 10:43.976
Chase! Chase!
Chase! Chase! Chase!

10:44.060 --> 10:47.229
Chase! Chase! Chase!
Chase! Chase!

10:47.313 --> 10:50.232
Chase! Chase!
Chase! Chase! Chase!

10:50.316 --> 10:52.360
Chase! Chase! Chase!
Chase! Chase!

10:52.443 --> 10:54.153
- Um...remember how we said
we wouldn't let

10:54.236 --> 10:56.906
this whole election thing,
you know, affect our friendship?

10:56.989 --> 10:57.907
Remember that?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.241
- Yeah, I remember that.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.787
- All right, I just wanted to
make sure we were cool!

11:02.870 --> 11:04.705
I'll--I'll call ya later!

11:04.789 --> 11:05.915
Ok?

11:05.998 --> 11:08.918
STUDENTS: Chase! Chase!
Chase! Chase! Chase!

11:09.001 --> 11:10.836
- And she hates me.
STUDENTS: Chase! Chase!

11:16.926 --> 11:18.886
- Zoey hates me.
- Who cares?

11:18.969 --> 11:22.098
- I care.
- What about your little pact?

11:22.181 --> 11:23.974
- Yeah, man,
you said Zoey told you

11:24.058 --> 11:25.684
no matter what
happened in the election,

11:25.768 --> 11:27.895
she'd be cool with it.
I thought you spit shook.

11:27.978 --> 11:31.399
- Wouldn't it be spit shaked?
- It doesn't matter!

11:31.482 --> 11:33.109
Girls think spit's gross,
all right?

11:33.192 --> 11:35.027
The point is, is that
this stupid election

11:35.111 --> 11:36.654
is gonna wreck
my friendship with Zoey.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.864
- She said it wouldn't.
- Were you just born?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.408
Don't you know
that girls don't mean

11:40.491 --> 11:41.909
half the things they say?

11:41.992 --> 11:44.036
Remember that girl you dated
a couple years ago?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.455
- Oh, yeah.
The Karen Franklin incident.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.165
- What happened
with Karen Franklin?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.834
- Her birthday was
comin' up, right?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.293
So I asked her
what she wanted.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.963
And she said "nothing."
So I said, "Nothing?"

11:54.046 --> 11:56.465
She goes, "Yeah, nothing."

11:56.549 --> 11:58.050
So I said, "Are ya sure?"

11:58.134 --> 12:01.345
And she's all, "Yes,
I don't want anything."

12:01.429 --> 12:04.181
So I didn't buy her a present.
CHASE: And?

12:04.265 --> 12:07.268
- She cried for 3 days,
then moved to Wisconsin.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.811
- Wisconsin?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.020
- It's the Dairy State.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.647
- Oh.
Wait.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.190
What was the point
of this story?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.317
- That you need to stay out of
my campaign, all right?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.485
I don't wanna win in a way

12:16.569 --> 12:18.320
that's gonna make Zoey
hate my guts.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.572
- All right.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.157
- I don't want you buying me
any more votes

12:21.240 --> 12:23.159
with your
evil smoothies, ok?

12:23.242 --> 12:24.326
- Ok.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.876
That's right!
Vote for chase!

12:31.959 --> 12:34.503
Chase Matthews
for class president!

12:34.587 --> 12:37.756
[excited chatter]

12:37.840 --> 12:38.841
- Vote for Zoey!

12:38.924 --> 12:39.842
Zoey for president.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.260
Hey, vote for Zoey.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.970
Remember to vote.
Zoey for president.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.055
- Remember to vote Tuesday.
- Vote for Chase.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.183
Chase Matthews
for class president!

12:47.266 --> 12:48.767
[cheering]

12:48.851 --> 12:50.269
- Don't forget to vote.
- Thank you.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.812
- That's right,
vote for Chase.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.481
Chase Matthews
for class president.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.607
- Chase!

12:54.690 --> 12:56.984
[excited chatter]

12:57.067 --> 12:58.527
- Now what?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.029
- When you vote
for class president,

13:00.112 --> 13:01.697
make sure it's for Chase!

13:01.780 --> 13:03.741
Yeah! Plenty more
where this came from.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.119
[excited chatter]

13:07.203 --> 13:09.371
- You're unbelievable!
- Thank you.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.040
- You're seriously
giving people money

13:11.123 --> 13:12.374
so they'll vote for Chase?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.459
- No.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.919
These are Chase Bucks.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.589
- Ok, what are "Chase Bucks?"

13:18.672 --> 13:20.883
- Chase Bucks can be redeemed
for merchandise at any store

13:20.966 --> 13:22.384
or cafeteria on campus.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.553
- And how's that different
from handing out cash?

13:24.637 --> 13:25.554
- Simple.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.014
Handing out cash is illegal.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.600
Handing out Chase Bucks
is genius.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.935
- That's still wrong!

13:31.018 --> 13:32.436
- You're just going around
the rules!

13:32.520 --> 13:33.562
- How can you do that?!

13:33.646 --> 13:35.356
- You really don't get
politics, do ya?

13:37.816 --> 13:40.027
- Where ya goin'?!

13:40.110 --> 13:42.154
- Vote for Chase!

13:44.156 --> 13:45.658
- Whoa!
- Chase!

13:45.741 --> 13:47.826
- Oh, man, there's a girl!
- Chase.

13:47.910 --> 13:48.953
- What's she doing in here?

13:49.036 --> 13:50.204
Hey, somebody call the coach.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.747
- Get her out.

13:51.830 --> 13:52.998
- Waaah!

13:53.082 --> 13:54.166
- What is this?!

13:54.250 --> 13:55.251
- Um,<i> this</i>

13:55.334 --> 13:57.962
is the guys'
locker room.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.213
You can't come in here.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.381
You're gonna get in trouble.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.299
- You're in trouble.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.968
- Chase Buck?
What is this?

14:04.051 --> 14:06.178
- They're redeemable
at every store on campus.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.805
- What?

14:07.888 --> 14:09.431
- Yeah, Logan's tossing out
handfuls to every kid

14:09.515 --> 14:11.433
in our class so they'll
all vote for you!

14:11.517 --> 14:12.601
- Aw, man.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.354
Aah.
Ok.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.397
Pinky's broken now.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.565
- This isn't funny!

14:17.648 --> 14:18.774
- I know!

14:18.857 --> 14:20.776
Look, Zoey, you promised me
that this election

14:20.859 --> 14:22.444
wouldn't wreck our friendship.
- Well, I didn't know

14:22.528 --> 14:24.238
what kind of campaign
you were gonna run!

14:24.321 --> 14:26.073
- It's not me!
It's...

14:26.156 --> 14:27.950
All right, that's it.
You know what?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.119
I'm out.
I'm done.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.620
- What do you mean, done?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.956
- I'm just gonna drop out
of this stupid race.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.293
- Oh, ok, so now you're just
gonna quit and let me win?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.919
- I didn't say that.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.462
- You think the only way I can
win is if you drop out.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.382
- How is this happening?

14:43.465 --> 14:46.135
- You better not quit,
or I'm gonna be really mad.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.178
- Zoey, would ya just--

14:51.390 --> 14:53.142
- I'm outta here.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.312
- Zoey--

14:56.395 --> 14:58.147
- Don't you drop out
of this election.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.441
- Ok, I won't drop out.
- Good.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.235
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm fine.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.654
- You don't sound fine.
- I'm fine!

15:05.738 --> 15:08.198
And I can win this election
without your help!

15:11.076 --> 15:12.494
There's no way I can win this.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.704
I'm depressed.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.080
- Oh, come on.

15:15.164 --> 15:15.623
There's still 2 days
till the election.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.499
You can win.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.627
- And what makes
you say that?

15:19.710 --> 15:20.711
- I don't know.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.212
I'm upbeat.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.505
QUINN: Zoey!

15:23.589 --> 15:25.716
I cannot believe you
made that commercial?

15:25.799 --> 15:26.842
- What commercial?

15:26.925 --> 15:28.344
- The one you made
about Chase.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.387
They keep running it
on the school station.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.389
- What?
- Come look.

15:36.268 --> 15:40.606
<i>CHASE: Chase Matthews wants to</i>
<i>be your class president.</i>

15:40.689 --> 15:43.692
<i>But how well do you really know</i>
<i>Chase Matthews?</i>

15:43.776 --> 15:48.197
<i>For example, did you know</i>
<i>he eats out of garbage cans?</i>

15:50.616 --> 15:52.868
<i>Or that he shaves his legs?</i>

15:52.951 --> 15:56.997
<i>Or that he picks on</i>
<i>little girls?</i>

15:57.081 --> 16:01.126
<i>Is this the kind of guy you</i>
<i>want for class president?</i>

16:01.210 --> 16:02.461
<i>No!</i>

16:02.544 --> 16:07.549
<i>On Tuesday, vote Zoey Brooks</i>
<i>for class president.</i>

16:07.633 --> 16:08.926
<i>She's awesome.</i>

16:09.009 --> 16:12.012
- How could you make a mean
commercial like that about him?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.013
- I didn't!

16:13.097 --> 16:14.682
- Zoey, you have slandered

16:14.765 --> 16:16.725
and desecrated
Chase's reputation.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.102
That's sad, Zoey.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.937
So, so sad.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.689
- All right.
Excuse me.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.826
Have you guys seen Chase?
- No.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.619
- But we saw your commercial.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.745
- That was pretty low.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.037
- Yeah, yeah.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.708
Logan!

16:46.004 --> 16:47.423
Where's Chase?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.216
- Hey, that commercial
was outta control.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.426
- Where's Chase?!

16:50.509 --> 16:51.635
- He's in his room.
Why?

16:55.931 --> 16:56.890
- I didn't do it.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.475
- You mean the commercial?

16:58.559 --> 17:00.519
- Yes! Look, even though I was
kinda mad at you, I swear,

17:00.602 --> 17:02.187
I would never do
anything mean like that.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.605
- I know.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.940
- Because your friendship
means way more to me

17:05.022 --> 17:06.900
than this dumb election.
- I made it.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.944
- And when I find out who
made it, I'm gonna hurt 'em!

17:09.028 --> 17:10.445
- I made the commercial.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.613
- Why?

17:11.696 --> 17:12.614
- Because,

17:12.698 --> 17:15.325
I mean, I never
wanted to be president.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.243
Look, when I nominated you,
