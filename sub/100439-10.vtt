WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:03.836
Turn the beat around

00:04.546 --> 00:07.299
Love to hear percussion

00:08.467 --> 00:10.385
Flute player, play your flute

00:10.469 --> 00:14.139
'Cause I know that
You got to get your beat on

00:18.685 --> 00:20.395
And when the drummer
Starts beating that beat

00:20.479 --> 00:23.232
With the syncopated rhythm going
Tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat on the drum

00:23.315 --> 00:26.568
You know, I'm just gonna give 'em a call.
This is stupid. 10:00 a.m. meeting.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.779
Be here on time.
Don't even have a commute.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.241
Please be wearing a shirt.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.659
Oh, hey, Dave.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.911
Are you serious?
What are you doing in a hot tub?

00:36.620 --> 00:38.330
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I'm in a hot tub.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.707
Yeah, I know that--
Just turn down the jets.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.167
Otherwise you're not going to be able
to hear me.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.669
I'm just gonna turn down the jets.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.254
Otherwise I'm not gonna be able
to hear you.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.130
-There you go.
-Great, thanks.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.507
Wait a second. Where's Poppy?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.217
She hasn't signed on yet.
I gotta give her a call now.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.760
No, no. I don't wait for her.
She waits for me.

00:51.844 --> 00:53.971
-You call her, then you call me back.
-No, come on.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.556
Don't do the power play thing, Ian.
It's not a--

00:55.639 --> 00:58.517
Oh, my God.
It's like herding cats. It really is.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.978
It's like herding big baby human cats.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.274
Please be showered.
Please be showered. Please--

01:05.357 --> 01:07.568
-Hello.
-Oh, my God. Are you serious?

01:07.651 --> 01:09.069
I mean, you look awful.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.238
No, I'm doing great.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.032
I'm on the best programming sprint
of my life.

01:14.116 --> 01:17.703
For the last 45 days, I haven't left
my computer except to pee and sleep.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.289
-Well, maybe leave once to wash yourself.
-Wait a minute. Where's Ian?

01:20.372 --> 01:22.541
No. We're not doing this.
We're not doing the power play thing.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.917
If he's not here, why am I?

01:24.001 --> 01:25.043
I'm gonna call him now, okay?

01:25.127 --> 01:27.004
Okay, well, I'm gonna go put a bra on

01:27.087 --> 01:29.214
since you need these meetings
to be all fancy or whatever.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.425
It's not fancy to wear undergarments
to a business meeting.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.304
You know what, just go put on the bra.
Put on the bra. It's unbelievable.

01:35.387 --> 01:39.391
It's like, just be human.
You know, just be a normal human being.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.392
Yo.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.477
Where's your shirt?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.438
Didn't feel appropriate, David.
I'm in a hot tub.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.398
Can't believe I have to ask this
during a pandemic,

01:46.481 --> 01:49.985
but would you just get out
of the hot tub and put on a shirt?

01:50.068 --> 01:50.944
-No.
-No?

01:51.028 --> 01:54.156
Hey! If Ian doesn't have to wear a shirt,
then I shouldn't have to wear a bra.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.657
-I'm taking this off.
-What?

01:55.741 --> 01:57.159
-It's so unfair.
-Don't take your bra off.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.036
-It's almost a clichÃ©.
-Fine. I'll get out of the hot tub.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.288
-You are allowed to do whatever you want.
-Fine, David, just ruin everybody's day.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.749
And I aren't allowed to do it.
And I tell you what--

02:03.832 --> 02:06.627
Guys. Oh, my God! What is happening?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.935
Okay, so I don't know where C.W. is.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.062
I know he was
having some trouble signing in.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.980
I mean, we gave him
all the sign-in information--

02:27.064 --> 02:28.565
Hey. David. Can we make this quick?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.026
I've got a lot of work to do
stripping Blood Ocean out of everything.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.319
Yeah. Yeah.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.947
Releasing a disease in the game
right before a global pandemic

02:35.030 --> 02:36.031
was not a great look.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.618
Poppy, you should be taking this time
to recharge and stay healthy like me.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.579
You know, I haven't left my compound
in like three months

02:42.663 --> 02:44.373
because I'm so afraid of getting sick.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.918
-He's too important to the world.
-Oh, Jo, you don't need to say that.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.294
But put it in the notes.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.964
No, don't put it in the notes, Jo.
It's not relevant to anything we're talk--

02:52.047 --> 02:53.048
Oh, I have an idea.

02:53.131 --> 02:57.302
What if instead of stripping Blood Ocean
out of the game, I build a vaccine?

02:57.386 --> 02:59.263
What? That would take you weeks.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.266
What are you-- I feel like
you're inventing work for yourself.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.851
I feel like you're a cashed-up bogan.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.811
"A cashed-up bogan"?

03:05.894 --> 03:09.189
David, Poppy is being mean in Australian.
Is the meeting almost over?

03:09.273 --> 03:10.315
The meeting hasn't started.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.317
You know what?
Let's just forget C.W. and jump right in.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.362
-Brad, can I get your attention, please?
-Oh, sorry, David.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.282
-I'm playing Street Fighter.
-No problem.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.075
-Thanks for letting me know.
-It's cool.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.537
Okay, so, obviously the quarantine
has been tough on everyone,

03:23.620 --> 03:27.833
but our industry is thriving,
and I think we should give back.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.753
So, I'm suggesting a $100,000 donation.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.297
-Wait a second. Wait, what?
-Huh?

03:33.380 --> 03:36.091
Brad, we as a company
have a responsibility--

03:36.175 --> 03:37.718
Money is my territory,
and I make the final call.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.012
I'm not giving something away
without getting something out of it.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.847
-That's insane.
-That's charity.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.765
You just described
exactly what charity is.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.517
-Not approved.
-All right, tell you what.

03:45.601 --> 03:46.602
Play me for it.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.314
Your little game there.
If I win, you gotta release the cash.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.191
Deal.

03:53.483 --> 03:57.154
But if I win, you gotta shave off
one of your eyebrows.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.866
-What?
-Fucking hell. Goodbye.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.619
She can't leave the meeting before me.
No. Goodbye.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.079
This is gonna be amazing. Goodbye.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.539
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.209
Unbelievable. Meeting adjourned.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.881
Hello.
I don't know what I pressed, but I'm here.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.798
Has the meeting started?

04:23.514 --> 04:27.059
This lag is real bad.
You can't judge attack time at all.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.229
That's what happens when the entire
world's playing on one server, I guess.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.522
-Right.
-Hey, question.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.606
Answer.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.816
-You want a chip?
-Oh, yeah.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.740
See? It's like nothing's changed, baby.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.368
-Hey, Rache.
-Yeah.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.411
Why do you wear that hoodie every day?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.498
Oh, it's cold in my apartment.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.583
Why don't you take off the hood?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.837
Okay, just don't judge me.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.257
Damn.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.760
Yeah, I know. I can't color it,
and I tried cutting it and--

05:01.844 --> 05:03.345
That is badass.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.182
You're like Storm from X-Men.
You're like fuckin' Halle Berry, girl.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.809
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.561
Hi!

05:10.644 --> 05:13.063
Oh, is that Rachel's mom?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.774
Hey, Rachel's mom, can you send Rachel in?
It's work time.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.693
-Lou, what are you doing here?
-I thought you got promoted.

05:17.776 --> 05:22.489
I did. They made me head guy in charge
of babysitting dum-dums like you.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.409
Couple of ground rules to go over:
I don't mute when I eat.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.869
I don't want to hear any chitchat.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.705
I don't want to hear any side chat,
certainly no back-sass.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.291
And, ladies, let's remember:

05:32.374 --> 05:33.750
we're all in this together.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.377
-Super.
-Great.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.301
-Yeah. You lose!
-Damn it.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.385
How are you so good at this game?

05:43.468 --> 05:45.262
I guess some people have it,
and some people don't.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.056
Speaking of not having things,
one eyebrow, please.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.017
Fine, I'll get my razor.

05:51.143 --> 05:54.271
Ah, shi-- Hold on. Sue's calling.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.480
Hey, Sue.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.609
Oh! It's a party.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.152
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

06:00.235 --> 06:03.947
but my inbox is filling up
with some very strongly-worded e-mails.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.949
Right. Yeah, what are the players
upset about now?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.952
It's actually-- it's the parents
of the players.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.746
They can't undo the parental control,

06:10.829 --> 06:14.416
so their kids are getting locked out
of the game after too many hours of play.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.626
And it seems like

06:15.709 --> 06:18.003
the one thing
that parents don't like to do is parent.

06:18.086 --> 06:22.007
Which, you know, kinda makes you wonder
why they had kids in the first place.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.133
Okay, so-- Well, thanks, Sue.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.135
We'll just take care of it.
All right, bye-bye.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.303
Okay, David. Sorry, David.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.388
-Just one last--
-Yeah.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.976
What might get us some goodwill
is that $100,000 donation.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.187
Actually, Sue, we're not gonna be
donating the money anymore.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.439
But David will be donating
his left eyebrow.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.150
Wait a second. That's it, yes. Yes!

06:40.234 --> 06:41.318
Okay, let's play again.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.072
And if I win, we donate $200,000,

06:45.155 --> 06:48.617
and if I lose,
I shave off my other eyebrow. Huh?

06:48.700 --> 06:52.538
I'm done dealing in brows.
I want your lashes.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.622
I--

06:54.331 --> 06:57.000
All right, fine. You can have
my eyelashes. Deal. Let's do it.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.252
-No, David!
-Deal!

06:58.335 --> 07:00.003
David, your eyelashes,
they're your third-best feature.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.172
-Okay, Sue, we gotta go. Take care.
-Don't--

07:06.218 --> 07:08.011
Yo, Carol. What's up?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.389
I'm gonna need less crotch, Ian.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.473
Oh, sorry.

07:12.474 --> 07:15.185
I don't hear that very often.
I'm just kidding. That's a joke.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.397
Okay. So, I'm calling because
I've received some reports

07:18.480 --> 07:19.982
about bizarre behavior.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.359
Well, it is the video game industry,
Carol.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.862
There are a lot of nuts there,
and they're probably ready to crack.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.365
Although, one person in particular
that I'm worried about is Poppy.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.367
There's something going on there,
I can tell.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.827
The reports have been about you.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.914
Ian, you can't send personal videos
to your employees

07:35.998 --> 07:39.168
with the subject line "Mandatory Viewing."

07:39.251 --> 07:41.378
-Well, those are meant to be inspiring.
-Really?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.631
Sometimes everything is wrong

07:44.715 --> 07:47.718
When your day is night alone

07:47.801 --> 07:50.304
Hold on

07:50.387 --> 07:52.306
Hold on

07:52.389 --> 07:53.724
Yeah, I'm showing people that

07:53.807 --> 07:57.186
we're all in this together
and that everybody hurts.

07:57.269 --> 08:01.732
Ian, if you wanna actually help people,
you're gonna have to make a sacrifice.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.735
Maybe give away some of that money
you clearly have.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.279
I'm happy to do it,
but that's not what people want right now.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.115
They want hope,
because money is not that important.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.409
It is to people who don't have it!

08:12.910 --> 08:15.329
You know what?
I ain't got time for this shit, okay?

08:15.412 --> 08:20.042
I gotta babysit y'all and homeschool
my own kids at the same time? Carol can't.

08:20.125 --> 08:24.338
Did you know they changed math?
They just up and changed how you do math.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.089
I'm done, okay?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.799
So, wear a shirt, don't wear a shirt.

08:27.883 --> 08:31.094
Get hammered and do 300 push-ups,
put it on YouTube. I don't care.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.597
-I'm sorry, Carol. I think I muted you.
-Mom, where are you?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.765
Did you say something?
Did you say something there?

08:35.849 --> 08:40.437
I'm coming. Goddamn kids at work,
kids at home. Oh, hell.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.042
Yes! Fuck yeah!

09:03.126 --> 09:05.337
Did it! I did it! I did it!

10:09.234 --> 10:12.446
Okay, look at the video icon
on the bottom left and then click that.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.365
Yes. Here.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.035
Yes, yes, I can see you. Perfect.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.788
Wait, I can't hear you.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.669
No, no, no. There's no audio. Okay,
click the unmute button, bottom left.

10:31.423 --> 10:35.969
No. No, no.
This is an audio FaceTime. Don't--

10:36.053 --> 10:38.222
Do you see me now? I just Facebooked you.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.642
Okay, you pressed the wrong button.
Let's just stick to one app, okay?

10:42.017 --> 10:44.478
-I'll text you.
-No, C.W., don't text me.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.355
Just a minute. Hang on.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.316
No, don't text--

10:49.399 --> 10:51.902
-Just stop pressing buttons!
-Huh? Oh, here! Let me try this!

10:51.985 --> 10:54.696
-No.
-That's better!

10:54.780 --> 10:58.534
What are you doing on the other side?
Hold on. Let me try something else.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.494
Just stop-- No!
Just stop pressing buttons!

11:00.577 --> 11:02.621
-How's that? Is that better?
-Just leave it the way it is!

11:02.704 --> 11:06.375
This is insane. This is truly--

11:06.834 --> 11:09.253
Hey, I see you. You see me?

11:09.336 --> 11:12.130
No, I mean, yeah.
Sure, but you're a panda.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.466
-A what?
-A panda!

11:14.550 --> 11:15.801
A panda?

11:15.884 --> 11:17.469
You must've pressed the wrong button,
okay,

11:17.553 --> 11:18.637
because you were just pressing buttons.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.139
Wait, wait, wait. There's an echo. Yeah.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.560
Echo. An echo. Echo, echo.
Don't you hear that echo?

11:24.643 --> 11:27.896
-Yes, I hear it. Just stop talking!
-You know, it doesn't echo when you talk.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.148
Just stop talking and listen
and look at the camera.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.150
-Which one?
-The only one! The panda one.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.486
I don't wanna be a goddamn panda!

11:34.570 --> 11:37.531
Science-fiction writer. How do you not
know how to just use a cell phone?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.241
-I'll fax you.
-Goddamn it.

11:39.324 --> 11:43.245
C.W., do not-- Get ba-- Get back he--

11:45.247 --> 11:46.081
This is insa--

11:51.336 --> 11:54.131
Pick up. Poppy, pick, pick, pick, pick.
Poppy, pick up.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.049
-What?
-Hey, Poppy!

11:56.133 --> 11:59.261
Congratulations. I heard you finished
your sprint. Let's celebrate.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.888
Thanks, I can't. I'm busy.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.682
Oh, no, you're not. David said
you are all finished with your work.

12:03.765 --> 12:08.395
And so am I because I've already had
two of these and I wanna make a third,

12:08.478 --> 12:09.897
so get on it.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.399
And, by the way, turn your camera on

12:12.482 --> 12:16.778
because it's less sad when
I can see you if I'm drinking alone.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.781
Great. Sorry, I can't turn it on.
I just got out of the bath.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.451
Bath? You don't bathe.
Now I know you're lying.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.162
-What's going on?
-Nothing's going on.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.623
I just don't want anyone
to see me right now, okay?

12:27.706 --> 12:30.042
All right, I--

12:30.125 --> 12:32.920
I did something nice for you and I wanted
to have a drink and watch it,

12:33.003 --> 12:34.546
but let me just send it to you now.
And you can--

12:34.630 --> 12:35.631
Hi, Poppy.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.091
I'm going to walk you through
a guided meditation.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.885
Now, relax, close your eyes

12:39.968 --> 12:44.640
and concentrate on the only thing
that matters, the sound of my voice.

12:44.723 --> 12:45.557
What is this?

12:45.641 --> 12:50.354
This is core exercise, but as you can see,
you're engaging your arms as well.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.563
That actually is not for you.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.941
What I like to do is come down
to my wine cellar here.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.318
Sorry, I keep popping up.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.819
Next, your guest cottage--

12:57.903 --> 13:00.864
-No, I don't-- Can you--
-You do not wanna leave your house.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.784
Turn the--
Can you get the videos off my--

13:03.867 --> 13:05.285
I don't wanna watch any-- Listen--

13:05.369 --> 13:07.412
-I just wanna be alone, okay?
-Okay, okay.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.081
Stop acting like you're trying to help me!

13:09.164 --> 13:12.835
This isn't about me. It's about you being
too scared to leave your compound,

13:12.918 --> 13:15.420
but you still need attention
because you're a fucking narcissist!

13:15.504 --> 13:17.422
What? A narcissist? Like-- Fine!

13:17.506 --> 13:19.591
Then, okay. I was doing something nice,
but forget it.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.553
Go! Go be with your dead plants,
your cats, or whatever. I don't care.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.221
-Okay, thanks. Yeah, I will.
-Okay, fine.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.807
I've got better shit to do too.
So, whatever, dude.

13:29.601 --> 13:35.023
Actually... I look huge. Like, massive.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.110
I'm gonna use this angle
at the next meeting.

13:38.193 --> 13:41.572
No, "fewer" modifies plural nouns.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.407
"Less" modifies singular.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.909
You can't have less female candidates.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.078
You can have fewer, and you should.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.122
And anybody who doesn't know that is dumb.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.040
Oh, my God.
Then I guess everyone's dumb, Lou.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.792
Rache.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.256
Oh, God.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.507
What? We're in quarantine.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.593
-We're having fun.
-Probably just thinks it's stupid.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.261
Actually, I don't think it's stupid.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.889
I think it's a good idea. It's just that
I think I would do it way better.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.265
Then prove it, asshole.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.058
All right. Here we go.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.563
Why do you have toilet paper on your desk?

14:15.147 --> 14:17.691
What? Oh, yeah,
I got toilet paper everywhere.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.943
I got loads of it.
Way more than I could ever use.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.987
I don't know,
you seem pretty full of shit.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.741
That's pretty good.
You know what, I like her.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.744
She should talk more.
You should talk fewer.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.996
See how stupid that sounds?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.164
Okay.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.249
All right. Dana, here we go.
This is what I want you to do.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.334
On the count of three,

14:35.417 --> 14:38.295
I want you to poke the bottom left side
of your screen. Got it?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.882
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.678
Rachel, grab a chip.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.059
Shit, that was better.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.393
That was cool.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.686
Can we do it again?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.647
If you want this to be really cool...

14:57.689 --> 14:59.149
we're gonna need more people.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.319
Preferably men.

15:06.198 --> 15:09.368
No! No! Damn!

15:09.826 --> 15:11.453
-God.
-Hey, David. David, David.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.121
Are we at your divorce trial right now?

15:13.205 --> 15:15.832
Because I just watched a hot Asian chick
rip your heart out.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.125
Okay, one more game.

15:17.209 --> 15:21.213
$300,000 against both eyebrows,
both eyelashes. Full monty.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.090
Pass. I'd rather have you lopsided.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.175
Come on, man.
I just wanna do some good here.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.845
There's gotta be something
you're willing to play for.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.558
I want your essence.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.853
-My what?
-I want your spiritual core.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.437
Your joie de vivre.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.774
I want the mustache.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.862
No. No, I need a mustache.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.530
I look weird without a mustache.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.783
I got bad news for you, bud.
You look weird with the mustache.

15:49.867 --> 15:54.496
But the question is, how badly
does David Brittlesbee wanna help people?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.586
All right, fine. Fine. Deal.
You got a deal, but we're locked in.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.588
Yeah, you're gonna look like an egg!

16:02.671 --> 16:04.548
Hey, Brad, I hope you don't mind,

16:04.631 --> 16:08.010
but I just wanted
to change up my gear a little bit.

16:08.719 --> 16:11.013
You see, the truth of the matter is,

16:11.096 --> 16:14.349
I just haven't felt right
without my fight stick.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.310
The fuck is all that? Wait, what is that?

16:16.393 --> 16:18.729
Well, you see,
when my parents got divorced,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.481
my mom would give me 20 bucks
and tell me to get lost.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.359
So I'd take that money,
along with all those feelings,

16:24.443 --> 16:29.156
and I'd head on down to the arcade, where
I played my favorite game, Street Fighter.

16:29.239 --> 16:33.285
Let's just say... I got a lot of practice.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.329
Oh, shit.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.039
Let's fight!

17:16.036 --> 17:18.038
Hey, Pop. You got my messages. Good.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.249
Are you on the street?

17:20.332 --> 17:22.166
Yeah. And I am not happy about it.

17:22.251 --> 17:24.377
It's like these people want to breathe
directly into my face.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.878
I mean, just right into my face.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.924
Hey, asshole.
Cross the street or I'll fuck you up.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.259
Really?

17:30.342 --> 17:31.927
Yeah. Okay.

17:32.010 --> 17:36.598
Okay, Pop, I'm gonna cross the street
because he called my bluff and he is big.

17:36.682 --> 17:40.686
You know, I don't think I am handling this
as well as I thought I was.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.230
I gotta admit, I think I'm struggling.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.192
Pop, you there?

17:48.861 --> 17:50.070
Yeah.

17:52.656 --> 17:53.907
You okay?

17:55.492 --> 17:56.493
Uh-huh.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.080
Can I see you then?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.003
No.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.300
Pop, come on, man.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.594
You're really freaking me out.
Just let me see you.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.520
I don't think I'm doing very well.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.192
It was okay when I still had work,

18:28.275 --> 18:31.361
but now that's done,
and I don't have anything else.

18:32.029 --> 18:35.824
All my family are thousands of miles away
and I don't have any friends.

18:35.908 --> 18:37.618
And I'm just alone.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.539
-That's not true. That's not true, Poppy.
-No, it is. It is.

18:42.623 --> 18:45.542
I thought that I could handle this,
but I don't think that I can.

18:45.626 --> 18:48.670
And everybody else
seems to have somebody, but I don't.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.797
I'm just--

18:51.465 --> 18:53.258
I'm just alone.

18:57.596 --> 18:58.805
Open your door.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.184
Why?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.521
Just open your door.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.279
Hi.

19:14.905 --> 19:15.906
Hi.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.261
I miss you.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.598
I miss you too.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.536
-Poppy...
-Yeah?

20:04.162 --> 20:07.708
You really do need to take a shower,
'cause you stink.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.588
You are such an asshole.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.550
You good?

20:16.925 --> 20:19.261
Yeah. You?

20:19.928 --> 20:21.180
Yeah. I'm good.

20:22.598 --> 20:24.099
All right, I'll see you soon.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.518
-All right.
-Bye.

20:35.903 --> 20:38.989
-The recipe is tequila...
-Reading a lot.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.949
-I painted this one.
-That's awesome.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.911
I can't watch any more TV.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.496
If you don't think that the
toilet paper industry started this,

20:46.580 --> 20:47.581
then you're fucking crazy.

20:47.664 --> 20:50.000
Via snail mail.
I just dropped them off at your house.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.252
Did you hear about how much money
toilet paper made?

20:52.336 --> 20:53.629
Hello!

20:53.712 --> 20:54.922
There she is.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.632
-Hey, Poppy. I waited for you.
-Hey.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.592
I waited for you this time in the meeting.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.595
-Nice one, mate.
-Looks like somebody did find that shower.

21:01.678 --> 21:02.888
I wanted to look fancy.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.389
Did you wash your hair?

21:04.473 --> 21:06.058
Yes, I washed my hair.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.142
All right.

21:07.809 --> 21:08.852
I'll keep my eye on it.

21:08.936 --> 21:13.023
Guys. Guys! Goddamn it! Guys!

21:14.316 --> 21:15.609
Good. There. Jesus.

21:15.692 --> 21:19.696
Now, remember, this only works
if we all do our part.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.782
Okay. We get one shot at this.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.575
So, don't fuck it up, Rachel.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.037
No one can hear you. It's paradise.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.748
All right.
Looks like we're waiting on C.W.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.375
But Brad has a quick announcement.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.876
Whatever. Fine. Brad, go.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.254
Yeah. Hey, everybody.
So, I had this bet with David.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.257
And, well, he totally sandbagged
and lost on purpose.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.885
But then we made the stakes really high
and we played one final time.

21:41.969 --> 21:45.305
And well... I still beat his ass!

21:47.766 --> 21:48.976
Whoa, David.

21:49.059 --> 21:50.894
-David, you look weird.
-Honey.

21:50.978 --> 21:53.689
-I know I look weird, okay?
-You look like a baby turtle.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.232
Wait, is that David or Sandy Duncan?

21:55.315 --> 21:58.360
But it'll grow back
in like eight or ten months. I don't know.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.903
Has anyone ever shaved their eyebrow?

21:59.987 --> 22:01.864
I don't know how long that takes.
Does it grow back?

22:01.947 --> 22:03.532
Whatever. It doesn't matter. I just--

22:03.615 --> 22:06.660
I feel bad
that I lost the $300,000 for charity.

22:06.743 --> 22:07.786
Oh, I already donated it.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.414
-What?
-Yeah, I was always gonna donate it.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.748
-What?
-Ian doubled it.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.459
-Yo.
-But-- Why?

22:14.543 --> 22:16.461
I thought--
You were opposed to giving away money.

22:16.545 --> 22:20.007
No, no. I told you I need
to get something out of it. Which I did.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.091
Your dignity.

22:21.717 --> 22:24.970
That's $600,000 for charity.
Way to go, David.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.306
-Way to go, David.
-Good job, David.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.641
-Nice work, Dave.
-Great job, David.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.476
Thank you, guys.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.103
Since we're all here,

22:33.187 --> 22:34.855
-I think it would be nice to say--
-Oh, God,

22:34.938 --> 22:37.232
here comes some boring SJW rant about--

22:37.316 --> 22:38.734
You know what, fuck you, Lou. Okay?

22:38.817 --> 22:40.360
You're being such a di--

22:40.444 --> 22:41.695
Oh, shit, I think I started it.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.322
-Wait, what?
-Go. Go, go!

22:43.405 --> 22:44.615
Oh, shit.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.366
Okay.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.267
Holy shit, it's working.

23:25.656 --> 23:27.741
-Wait, where's C.W.?
-Where is he?

23:27.824 --> 23:30.369
-Come on, dude. Figure it out.
-Come on, man.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.620
Where is he?

23:34.164 --> 23:35.499
Oh, my God!

23:35.582 --> 23:36.542
Come on!

23:38.752 --> 23:39.628
Come on!

23:41.922 --> 23:44.883
Huzzah!

23:44.967 --> 23:47.511
I made it!

23:47.594 --> 23:49.555
C.W., you're the man!

23:53.016 --> 23:54.184
Yes!

24:12.536 --> 24:14.371
Fuck you, coronavirus.
