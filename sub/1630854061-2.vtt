00:54.304 --> 00:55.430
Stop!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.767
-Show me your hands.
- Uncle?

01:02.312 --> 01:04.689
Is this a pillow to soften the blow?

01:05.482 --> 01:08.318
Only a coward would use such a thing!

01:09.235 --> 01:11.071
A man without honor

01:11.738 --> 01:13.198
is no man.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.077
Do you want to be a man, Chozen?

01:18.328 --> 01:20.080
Or do you want to be a coward?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.378
Continue!

03:19.949 --> 03:20.992
Speak Spanish?

03:21.993 --> 03:22.827
Spanish?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.998
You're in a tow zone.
I need you to move the van.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.336
I want man.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.965
I don't know a Hector Salazar.
You have to move the van, please.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.302
No, no money.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.762
Move the van.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.102
Money?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.064
You're gonna enjoy it.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.545
Place your bets!

09:22.937 --> 09:25.022
Look at the gringo
sweating like a pig.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.400
He'll be dead before the second round.

09:30.778 --> 09:31.612
One more.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.730
Place your bets!

15:11.160 --> 15:13.245
- Can we skip the line?
-Of course, Hector!

15:14.038 --> 15:15.581
Ah, welcome.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.601
Fortaleza. Two.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.985
Let me introduce
my friend here. We just met.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.613
He helped me
avoid an accident the other day.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.579
- All right.
-My buddy is a martial arts champion.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.499
And he can take your job away like that.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.168
Hmm. All right, I gotta warm up.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.187
I need man.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.496
What's up?

20:47.579 --> 20:50.207
Hector, there are some gringos here
asking about you.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.124
Gringos?

20:51.917 --> 20:55.295
-What gringos? Who'd they come with?
-I think they're with the FBI.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.756
Son of a bitch.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.424
Get downstairs.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.135
Listen. They don't have jurisdiction here.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.221
So keep them busy.

22:56.917 --> 23:01.088
- â€¦headline fight!
-The assholes are here. There are two.

23:01.171 --> 23:05.592
Vicente "The Wolf" Gonzales!

23:07.594 --> 23:09.638
You won't wanna miss this!

23:09.721 --> 23:10.972
Look! Over there!

23:11.056 --> 23:12.933
Show those feds how we fight.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.020
You're not
getting near Hector.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.271
One minute.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.233
Looks like the Wolf is having
trouble getting in the ring.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.989
The Wolf grabs a hold
of this crazy white man!

23:31.535 --> 23:33.453
But he escapes!

23:37.958 --> 23:39.960
Crazy guy's on the offensive!

23:41.753 --> 23:43.505
He's doing karate!

23:44.131 --> 23:46.258
It's karate versus MMA!

23:46.341 --> 23:49.094
He kicks as fast as lightning!

23:51.596 --> 23:52.764
Oh my God!

23:53.432 --> 23:56.309
It looks like MMA is kicking karate's ass!

24:07.154 --> 24:10.407
Things don't look good
for White Lightning!

24:21.668 --> 24:22.752
My eyes!

24:25.922 --> 24:27.340
Spectacular!

24:28.425 --> 24:29.843
What a fight!

24:32.137 --> 24:33.430
Where's Hector?

28:53.481 --> 28:56.359
They tried to fuck with me,
a successful man!

28:56.985 --> 29:00.822
The corrupt sons of bitches in Ecuador,
they did the same!

30:03.802 --> 30:06.137
Take care of yourself, kid.
