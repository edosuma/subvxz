00:07.971 --> 00:10.407

00:23.488 --> 00:25.455
- Thank you, everybody!
- Happy birthday.

00:25.456 --> 00:27.525
Thank you, Heidi.
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:27.525 --> 00:32.162
I am, and I intend always to be,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:32.162 --> 00:35.132
Of course you know my assistant,
the poster boy for <i>Plaid</i> magazine,

00:35.133 --> 00:36.895
Alfred E. Borland.

00:38.436 --> 00:39.536
Thank you.

00:39.871 --> 00:41.505
- Happy birthday, Tim.
- Thanks, Al.

00:41.506 --> 00:46.843
Congratulations on surviving another
year without electrocuting yourself.

00:46.844 --> 00:50.647
Hey, show's not over yet.
Well, folks, it's my birthday today.

00:50.648 --> 00:52.649
Thanks for showing up.
And I gotta be honest with you.

00:52.650 --> 00:54.309
I don't like birthdays. You know why?

00:54.318 --> 00:56.052
- Why?
- Why?

00:56.053 --> 00:59.022
Well, because every year
a well-intended person

00:59.023 --> 01:00.624
plans my birthday for me.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.959
This year I'm doing
just what I want to do.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.263
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

01:06.264 --> 01:08.731
I'm going to a NASCAR race.
Got VIP seats.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.534
Yeah. And after the race
I'm coming home. I've got it taped.

01:10.535 --> 01:13.799
I'm gonna watch it again, this time
in my recliner sitting there in my house

01:13.805 --> 01:15.939
enjoying the three R's, baby!

01:15.940 --> 01:17.941
- And the three R's would be?
- You know 'em, huh?

01:17.942 --> 01:20.444
Remote, ribs and Rolaids.

01:20.445 --> 01:23.447
Well, in honor of Tim's birthday,
we asked our viewers

01:23.448 --> 01:25.983
to give us their version
of a "Man's Cake."

01:26.751 --> 01:29.686
Well, here's a mag wheel cake
from Jim in Ypsilanti.

01:29.687 --> 01:31.855
Jim, good job with the mag wheel.
I like it already.

01:31.856 --> 01:34.983
It's a butter cream filling
with a chiffon base.

01:37.495 --> 01:41.298
Why didn't you guys just send me
a chiffon dress?

01:41.299 --> 01:43.400
What happened to devil's-food cake?

01:43.401 --> 01:46.036
It's easy to make. And that's what
we're gonna show you how to do today.

01:46.037 --> 01:49.473
You got a bowl. Very simple.
You put in the cake mix.

01:49.474 --> 01:53.109
Pronto, just like that.
A little cholesterol.

01:53.110 --> 01:57.047
Eggs. You got your butter.

01:57.048 --> 02:00.050
And a soupÃ§on of oil for your fats.

02:00.051 --> 02:02.916
A little bit more for easy exit.
There you go.

02:04.522 --> 02:07.057
You mix it up. You put it in
one of those little cake pans.

02:07.058 --> 02:08.592
You put a little of that shortening
in there.

02:08.592 --> 02:11.561
You put it in the oven.
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing! 350.

02:11.562 --> 02:13.563
Next thing you know...

02:17.001 --> 02:21.171
You have a cake
that is shaped like a brick.

02:21.172 --> 02:25.175
And that baby is dead level.

02:26.010 --> 02:28.670
Looks good enough to eat, Al.
As a matter of fact,

02:28.679 --> 02:32.115
I think I'm gonna enjoy a little slice
of this bad boy right now.

02:32.116 --> 02:36.119
Well, Tim, actually, before you do that,
I want to show you my surprise cake.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.487
- Well, Al, I want to sit down...
- It took...

02:37.488 --> 02:39.557
and take a look at these
gifts I've got here.

02:39.557 --> 02:41.191
- Look at that cake.
- Well, actually,

02:41.192 --> 02:43.352
I have a surprise cake for...

02:59.010 --> 03:00.373
Surprise!

03:53.965 --> 03:55.328
Oh, yeah.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.030
Yeah!

04:01.005 --> 04:04.975
Oh, sweet mystery of life.

04:04.976 --> 04:09.713
I told you not to do that <i>Tool Time</i>
salute to nerve gas.

04:09.714 --> 04:11.848
If I'd found this chair
before I found your mother,

04:11.849 --> 04:14.418
you wouldn't be around
to make that joke.

04:17.053 --> 04:19.889
Hi, guys. What are you doing?

04:19.890 --> 04:23.460
Just practicing for my day by myself
for my birthday.

04:23.461 --> 04:26.529
The guys gave me this at work.
It's got little slots for my drinks

04:26.530 --> 04:29.099
and my selection
of fine aerosol cheeses.

04:31.002 --> 04:33.470
Well, if you think that's great,
wait till you see what I got you.

04:33.471 --> 04:35.238
Yeah?

04:35.239 --> 04:37.274
Oh, I was gonna give it to you
at dinner tonight,

04:37.275 --> 04:38.375
but I'm too excited.

04:38.376 --> 04:42.412
Does it have anything to do with
NASCAR racing or chewable antacids?

04:42.413 --> 04:44.482
Not even close.

04:49.887 --> 04:53.549
- A little boat for the bathtub?
- No. Look under it. Under it.

04:53.557 --> 04:56.993
- No, in the box! In the box.
- Oh, look. Airline tickets.

04:56.994 --> 04:59.162
Yeah.

04:59.163 --> 05:00.530
You planned something
for my birthday?

05:00.531 --> 05:03.566
Yes, I've been planning it for months.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.636
I told you not to plan anything
for my birthday.

05:05.636 --> 05:09.072
- You say that every year.
- Yes, I do.

05:09.073 --> 05:11.708
We're going to Kernville, California.

05:11.709 --> 05:13.141
Kernville?

05:16.414 --> 05:20.281
Three days of roughing it.
River-rafting by day, camping at night.

05:20.284 --> 05:21.451
Is that fantastic?

05:21.452 --> 05:23.486
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

05:23.487 --> 05:26.323
But, you know, I don't want to take
the boys out of school.

05:26.324 --> 05:27.490
The boys aren't going.

05:27.491 --> 05:30.927
I want to spend some time with Lauren
before she goes to Costa Rica.

05:30.928 --> 05:32.262
What about Brad and Mark?

05:32.263 --> 05:36.666
Well, they're too embarrassed
to be seen in public with their parents.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.134
Brad has a soccer game.
Mark's band's playing at a dance.

05:39.136 --> 05:40.937
Your mom's gonna
look in on them for us.

05:40.938 --> 05:44.240
Great! All right!

05:44.241 --> 05:45.809
Kernville.

05:47.511 --> 05:51.448
For river-rafting, you're gonna
need four, and the kids can't go.

05:51.449 --> 05:53.583
I'm way ahead of you. Get this.

05:53.584 --> 05:56.353
Wilson, Al and Heidi are going!

05:56.354 --> 05:59.014
- Al's going?
- Yes!

05:59.023 --> 06:01.758
Happy birthday, honey.

06:01.759 --> 06:03.893
Listen, I'm gonna go start packing.

06:03.894 --> 06:05.595
I already got the sleeping bags
dry-cleaned.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.597
All right!

06:08.799 --> 06:10.868
We're going to Kernville!

06:21.579 --> 06:24.347
- Hi, we're the Taylors.
- I'm Cub.

06:24.348 --> 06:29.185
Welcome to Rafting Adventures,
where rafting is an adventure.

06:29.186 --> 06:32.589
Did you think that up
all by yourself, Cub?

06:32.590 --> 06:36.292
No, no. That was some college dude.

06:36.293 --> 06:37.827
I'll get you started on your paperwork

06:37.828 --> 06:40.063
while Jane over there
gets you fitted for life jackets.

06:40.064 --> 06:41.164
- Oh, great. Great.
- Okay?

06:41.165 --> 06:42.665
- I'll be right over there, honey.
- Okay.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.267
- Can't wait, huh?
- Yeah.

06:44.268 --> 06:46.703
Oh, boy! Hey, is there any chance that

06:46.704 --> 06:48.638
the weather will turn bad
and close the river down?

06:48.639 --> 06:51.641
- Oh, I take it you're not into rafting.
- Well, no, rafting's great, you know?

06:51.642 --> 06:57.511
But it's my birthday, you know? And
I had VIP seats to see a NASCAR race,

06:57.515 --> 07:00.150
- first class all the way.
- Oh, if you're looking for first class,

07:00.151 --> 07:02.618
you came to the right place
because we offer deluxe packages

07:02.620 --> 07:04.687
with the finest accommodations.

07:04.688 --> 07:06.416
Really?

07:07.591 --> 07:09.626
Yeah!

07:09.627 --> 07:12.629
Well, what package did my wife order?

07:12.630 --> 07:15.732
The "Back to Basics."
Sky above you, dirt below you.

07:15.733 --> 07:19.269
And watch out for leaves of three
when you're wiping.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.272
Well, that paints a pretty picture,
doesn't it?

07:22.273 --> 07:26.176
Is there any way I can upgrade us
to this imperial package?

07:26.177 --> 07:28.411
- Well, sure. Sure.
- Well, great.

07:28.412 --> 07:30.146
- Let's just keep it between us.
- Oh, okay.

07:30.147 --> 07:32.115
And this ought to cover it.

07:32.116 --> 07:35.919
While you're at it, why don't you
buy yourself a real name?

07:35.920 --> 07:38.353
- Hey, Tim! We're almost unpacked.
- Great.

07:38.355 --> 07:41.425
I can't wait to get on that river.
It's gonna be total gnar.

07:41.425 --> 07:43.892
- That means big bad whitewater.
- Oh, yeah.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.196
Sounds like you've been up and down
the river a few times.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.528
That was before I was married.

07:50.768 --> 07:54.704
All right! We're ready to raft, huh?

07:54.705 --> 07:57.207
Al, Lewis and Clark
didn't carry this much stuff.

07:57.208 --> 08:01.678
Yeah, well, they didn't
spend 18 years in Boy Scouts.

08:01.679 --> 08:04.480
Boy, you really prepared for this trip!
You got some great equipment there.

08:04.481 --> 08:07.517
Well, when I go camping,
I go Binford, huh?

08:07.518 --> 08:10.782
I first heard the call of the wild
when I was eight years old.

08:10.788 --> 08:14.450
That was your mom, wasn't it?
"Al, the macaroni's ready!"

08:14.692 --> 08:19.128
Well, hidey ho, river rats.

08:19.129 --> 08:20.363
Cool helmet.

08:20.364 --> 08:24.701
Yes, this is the kayaking helmet I wore
on my last river trip. I kayaked in Chile.

08:24.702 --> 08:28.170
I've swam in chili myself.
Look, can we get going?

08:28.172 --> 08:30.573
Not before you get your life jackets
and sign this waiver, please.

08:30.574 --> 08:33.234
- Great.
- If you could just come over here.

08:34.544 --> 08:38.207
"I understand that river-rafting involves
risks which include injury..." Great.

08:38.215 --> 08:43.879
"Fatality due to capsizing, collision,
drowning or hypothermia."

08:43.888 --> 08:46.753
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

08:52.663 --> 08:55.598
Al, you knew I wanted
to plan my own birthday.

08:55.599 --> 08:59.535
- Why did you agree to do this?
- Well, it sounded like fun, you know?

08:59.536 --> 09:03.368
Besides, I wanted to try out
my new Binford Trout Buddy.

09:04.275 --> 09:06.109
You call yourself a friend?

09:06.110 --> 09:09.846
I would never
spend your birthday with you.

09:09.847 --> 09:14.684
- You know, just relax. Enjoy yourself.
- I wanted to watch a NASCAR race.

09:14.685 --> 09:17.854
- We got a safety lecture coming up.
- Safety lecture.

09:17.855 --> 09:20.117
I know.
Real men don't need safety lectures.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.724
Yeah? Who's the real man?

09:21.725 --> 09:25.495
That would be me. Tim Taylor.
Who are you?

09:25.496 --> 09:27.697
You know, that's a good question.

09:27.698 --> 09:29.332
Ever since the war,
I've been trying to figure that out.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.468
But with the flashbacks
and the thumping in my brain,

09:32.469 --> 09:33.935
it's been tough.

09:33.938 --> 09:38.703
- I was just looking for a name.
- I'm Kyle, your guide.

09:42.746 --> 09:43.947
You hit a rock.

09:43.948 --> 09:45.048
Half the boat wants to go to the right.

09:45.049 --> 09:46.282
The other half wants to go to the left.

09:46.283 --> 09:48.685
Now you've got to make a decision.
What do you do?

09:48.686 --> 09:49.919
Taylor!

09:49.920 --> 09:53.223
- Kicking some Martian butt! Ha!
- Tim!

09:53.224 --> 09:54.991
Does anybody know what to do
if your boat hits a rock?

09:54.992 --> 09:57.393
I do! You get to the high side of the raft.

09:57.394 --> 09:59.596
- Excellent! Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

09:59.597 --> 10:01.256
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

10:03.000 --> 10:05.797
Little green blob,
who's your daddy now?

10:13.444 --> 10:15.245
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

10:15.246 --> 10:17.614
It's just, you know, this thing
that flared up this summer.

10:17.615 --> 10:18.876
- Yeah.
- It'll be okay.

10:18.882 --> 10:20.049
Easy. Easy, easy, easy. You all right?

10:20.050 --> 10:21.150
Oh, no.

10:21.151 --> 10:23.253
Oh, now, Jill, it doesn't
sound like you're all right to me.

10:23.254 --> 10:25.054
Jill, there's no way
I can let you on this river.

10:25.055 --> 10:26.289
Jill, I'll stay here with you.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.257
No. No, I don't want
to wreck Tim's birthday.

10:28.258 --> 10:29.792
No. You don't want to do that.

10:29.793 --> 10:32.595
Kyle, is there any way
that she can stay off the river

10:32.596 --> 10:33.857
but still go camping with us?

10:33.864 --> 10:36.232
- Al?
- Sure.

10:36.233 --> 10:39.202
You can stay with my wife.
You gals can spend the day together

10:39.203 --> 10:41.137
and she can drive back
to the camp at night.

10:41.138 --> 10:42.438
Are you sure she doesn't mind that?

10:42.439 --> 10:46.142
Oh, no. She's got a light day.
All she has to do is cobble my shoes

10:46.143 --> 10:48.303
and make soup out of bark.

10:50.547 --> 10:53.249
All right, Mark. Get up.
You've been shaking for a half-hour.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.752
I still have two more minutes.

10:55.753 --> 10:58.345
Yeah? Well, not according to
my watch. Please get up.

10:59.656 --> 11:00.790
Smooth.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.126
You just spilled grape soda
all over the couch.

11:03.127 --> 11:04.227
Yeah? Well, it's your fault
for not moving.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.294
Now go get some towels.

11:05.295 --> 11:07.489
- You're the one that pushed me.
- Shut up.

11:23.380 --> 11:27.150
Gosh, you guys! It's so beautiful
out here. The blue sky, the trees...

11:27.151 --> 11:29.118
Not to mention these leeches.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.354
There are no
leeches on this river.

11:31.355 --> 11:34.957
Well, just in case,
I brought some Leech Be Gone.

11:34.958 --> 11:36.583
Never use that!

11:37.227 --> 11:39.262
Ruins the taste.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.264
So, Kyle,
we know that you like parasites.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.499
How long have you been
a guide on the river here?

11:43.500 --> 11:46.869
Ever since my army buddy
got me the gig.

11:46.870 --> 11:49.605
- Then he passed away.
- Sorry to hear that.

11:49.606 --> 11:54.544
They say it was natural causes,
but I say the government killed him.

11:54.545 --> 11:57.480
Kyle, what do you say
we get you into the shade, huh?

11:57.481 --> 11:58.742
Hey, rapid ahead.

11:58.749 --> 12:01.819
- Taylor, start paddling.
- Hey, paddle this!

12:04.188 --> 12:05.847
Here we go.

12:09.493 --> 12:11.061
Come on!

12:16.667 --> 12:19.502
- That was incredible!
- Totally awesome!

12:19.503 --> 12:22.705
No, no, no. What would be awesome is
watching Dale Earnhardt

12:22.706 --> 12:26.409
fly around a tri-oval
at about 200 miles an hour, okay?

12:26.410 --> 12:27.677
Tim, can't you just enjoy yourself?

12:27.678 --> 12:29.378
Yeah, well,
that was just a Class 2 rapid.

12:29.379 --> 12:32.949
Down river we got some 3's and 4's
that'll fill up those drawers.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.784
Promises, promises.

12:34.785 --> 12:37.720
You know, birthday boy,
you look a little familiar.

12:37.721 --> 12:40.723
Well, I have
a very popular television show.

12:40.724 --> 12:42.892
I don't own a TV.

12:42.893 --> 12:45.828
The government uses the airwaves
to send subliminal messages

12:45.829 --> 12:48.464
to destroy our minds.

12:48.465 --> 12:51.868
And you certainly wouldn't want
anyone messing with that noggin.

12:51.869 --> 12:54.437
Yeah. Well, this noggin,

12:54.438 --> 12:58.207
it's the only thing standing between
you and an ugly watery death.

12:58.208 --> 13:02.541
Fluid fills your lungs, your throat
closes up, your brain shuts down.

13:05.716 --> 13:10.686
<i>Happy birthday to Timmy
Happy birthday to me</i>

13:19.329 --> 13:22.565
Bark's tender.
Would you like some soup?

13:22.566 --> 13:24.567
No. I think I'll just wait
till the others get back.

13:24.568 --> 13:27.900
Besides, isn't the rafting company
supposed to bring us our dinner?

13:28.138 --> 13:30.339
Yeah.
But you don't want to eat that poison.

13:30.340 --> 13:31.440
I don't?

13:31.441 --> 13:34.644
You know what USDA stands for?

13:34.645 --> 13:37.112
"US Deceives Americans."

13:38.615 --> 13:41.817
- Hi, honey.
- Hey! Hey! How was it?

13:41.818 --> 13:44.787
Oh, it was great.
A couple of birthday bug bites,

13:44.788 --> 13:46.155
some birthday river
up my birthday butt,

13:46.156 --> 13:47.924
couldn't be birthday better.

13:47.925 --> 13:50.993
- You didn't have a good time?
- Yeah, yeah. Yes, I did.

13:50.994 --> 13:53.462
Yeah, of course it was a great time.
I'm just a little hungry, I guess.

13:53.463 --> 13:58.067
I've got just the thing for you.
A hot, steaming bowl full of wood.

13:58.068 --> 14:01.002
Try it. The bark's got a little bite to it.

14:02.606 --> 14:06.375
<i>Michael, row the boat ashore</i>

14:06.376 --> 14:10.313
<i>Hallelujah</i>

14:10.314 --> 14:13.976
<i>Then the Feds, they tax him more</i>

14:13.984 --> 14:19.182
<i>They'll always screw you!</i>

14:23.060 --> 14:25.595
Oh, my God! What is that?

14:28.065 --> 14:29.799
Relax. Relax.

14:29.800 --> 14:34.103
Last time they landed,
they were very nice to me.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.969
Sounds like some kind of a bus.

14:38.642 --> 14:42.411
Could be the rafting company's
luxury motor coach.

14:42.412 --> 14:44.777
Maybe it's the Oak Ridge Boys!

14:48.385 --> 14:52.888
What kind of a boob would order
a luxury bus on a camping trip?

14:52.889 --> 14:55.151
Come on. Come on. Look at this thing.

14:55.158 --> 14:58.761
Detroit diesel-powered,
convection oven, sleeps six...

14:58.762 --> 15:01.422
A luxury bus on a camping trip?

15:01.431 --> 15:04.367
Oh, but you hurt your back.
I wanted you to be more comfortable.

15:04.368 --> 15:07.403
No, no, no, no.
There was no phone on that raft.

15:07.404 --> 15:09.171
You did this before I was hurt.

15:09.172 --> 15:11.374
Okay, okay.
I wanted me to be more comfortable.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.709
I can't believe you did this
without telling me.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.778
You planned this whole birthday
without telling me.

15:15.779 --> 15:17.279
Well, duh! It was a surprise.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.145
Well, a surprise is supposed to be
something the other person likes.

15:20.150 --> 15:23.220
On my birthday, you just decide
to do things and then drag me along.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.454
I try to think of things that you like.

15:25.455 --> 15:27.757
Oh, yeah. Like last year?
On the way to the bed and breakfast,

15:27.758 --> 15:31.060
- you stop off at a tulip festival?
- That was fun.

15:31.061 --> 15:34.163
You made me do the clog dance!

15:34.164 --> 15:37.700
Look, if you didn't want to go rafting,
why didn't you just tell me?

15:37.701 --> 15:39.936
Oh, that would've gone over real well.

15:39.937 --> 15:42.572
"Honey, I know you busted your butt
planning this whole thing,

15:42.573 --> 15:44.407
"but I want to go
to a NASCAR race by myself

15:44.408 --> 15:46.108
"and feast on aerosol cheese."

15:46.109 --> 15:48.678
Honey, it was your birthday.
We could've done what you wanted.

15:48.679 --> 15:51.113
It still is my birthday,
and I want to stay in this bus.

15:51.114 --> 15:53.049
I can't believe
after 19 years of marriage,

15:53.050 --> 15:55.651
- you still can't be honest with me.
- I'm being honest with you right now.

15:55.652 --> 15:57.778
Too late!

16:06.029 --> 16:10.132
Does anybody know what time it is?

16:10.133 --> 16:15.797
5:00. Oh, God, my back!

16:15.806 --> 16:18.708
I haven't heard sounds
like that since I was in Nairobi

16:18.709 --> 16:21.938
studying the breathing patterns
of warthogs.

16:22.946 --> 16:25.675
- Maybe if he had another pillow?
- Done.

16:27.918 --> 16:29.018
Under him!

16:30.954 --> 16:33.523
Hot shower and a little breakfast.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.286
Did I sleep well or what!

16:39.329 --> 16:42.732
I've got some hot cheese blintzes
in the oven, guys! Huh?

16:42.733 --> 16:44.495
- Shut up!
- Shut up.

16:46.169 --> 16:47.803
So did you have any luck
with that stain?

16:47.804 --> 16:49.065
You tell me.

16:51.441 --> 16:53.142
Mark, what'd you put on there?

16:53.143 --> 16:56.312
I thought I heard Mom say that red wine
takes out soda stains.

16:56.313 --> 17:00.649
No, you idiot.
Soda takes out red wine stains.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.384
This is bad, isn't it?

17:02.385 --> 17:05.221
Well, let's see. Mom and Dad
come home and the couch is stained

17:05.222 --> 17:07.984
and the whole place smells of booze.

17:09.226 --> 17:11.227
We gotta get rid of the smell.

17:11.228 --> 17:13.128
You're right.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.290
Let's try some bleach.

17:24.241 --> 17:26.075
Would you guys
stop paddling a minute?

17:26.076 --> 17:27.906
My magazine's getting all wet.

17:28.578 --> 17:30.579
You know, Taylor,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.915
Your wife takes the time
to plan this great trip for you.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.542
And what do you do?
You piddle all over it.

17:36.386 --> 17:39.752
Hey, look!
It's my party, I'll piddle if I want to.

17:40.824 --> 17:43.759
Maybe next year
I'll let Tim plan his own birthday.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.461
That would be wise.

17:45.462 --> 17:49.465
We have to do whatever we can
to keep our marriages strong.

17:49.466 --> 17:52.501
- You're very insightful, Luanne.
- Well, I have to be.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.367
Because the evil forces of the world
are out to get us.

17:55.372 --> 17:57.100
What evil forces?

17:58.675 --> 18:03.873
The dairy farmers and the people
who make aluminum foil.

18:06.082 --> 18:08.284
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:08.285 --> 18:09.944
- Again?
- Shut up!

18:09.953 --> 18:12.655
Old Al "The River Runs Through Him"
Borland.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.520
You know, at least he's paddling.

18:14.524 --> 18:17.226
If everyone was a tube lizard like you,
we'd get maytagged.

18:17.227 --> 18:18.995
"Maytag"? "Tube lizard"?

18:18.996 --> 18:21.096
A couple of brochures,
what are you, Popeye all of a sudden?

18:21.097 --> 18:25.835
Oh, you'll have to forgive Tim.
He can't help being an insensitive lout!

18:25.836 --> 18:27.937
You're no picnic either, Sinus Boy.

18:27.938 --> 18:30.172
Yeah, tell me about it!
I was up all night.

18:30.173 --> 18:32.975
I never had this problem
with my kayaking buddies.

18:32.976 --> 18:35.578
Would you quit yakking
about your kayaking?

18:35.579 --> 18:38.681
Well, it's better than listening to
your boring stories of how you

18:38.682 --> 18:41.183
and your mom went to Anchorage
and caught fish with your hands.

18:41.184 --> 18:44.086
- Lucky she wasn't harpooned.
- Shut up!

18:44.087 --> 18:46.222
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

18:46.223 --> 18:47.523
No, you shut up!

18:47.524 --> 18:48.824
- Shut up!
- Shut up, Tim!

18:48.825 --> 18:51.060
I can't take it anymore!

18:51.061 --> 18:53.763
So much noise
I can't hear the voices in my head.

18:53.764 --> 18:58.029
Oh, our guide has voices in his head.
How about this one? Incoming!

18:58.602 --> 18:59.863
Over!

19:04.641 --> 19:07.543
Oh, great, Tim.
Now we don't even have a guide.

19:07.544 --> 19:10.913
- This is all your fault!
- This isn't my fault.

19:10.914 --> 19:12.548
I didn't want to go to this thing
in the first place.

19:12.549 --> 19:15.084
Friends, friends, friends,
in the words of Benjamin Franklin,

19:15.085 --> 19:18.420
"We must all hang together
or else we shall hang separately."

19:18.421 --> 19:21.624
And we'd better hang
together fast. Look up ahead.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.725
Oh, no!

19:24.761 --> 19:27.092
Come on, let's go!

19:32.803 --> 19:35.964
Come on, come on,
come on, don't stop now!

19:36.106 --> 19:38.505
Go, go, go, go, go!

19:41.545 --> 19:44.274
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

19:46.883 --> 19:48.817
We did it!

19:48.818 --> 19:51.387
You know, this has turned out to be
a pretty decent birthday after all.

19:51.388 --> 19:53.013
Yeah.

19:54.357 --> 19:55.424
This is a good thing, you know,

19:55.425 --> 19:58.859
because it just might
turn out to be my last! Look at that!

20:02.832 --> 20:06.735
Okay, guys. Paddles ready.
We can do this.

20:06.736 --> 20:08.737
Oh, Mother, I love you!

20:30.560 --> 20:31.660
Oh, no!

20:33.630 --> 20:34.959
Come on, break it!

20:37.334 --> 20:38.434
Paddle.

20:38.635 --> 20:39.735
Yeah!

20:42.472 --> 20:44.106
How could you abandon them?

20:44.107 --> 20:47.242
I'm not proud of what I did,
but a man's gotta do

20:47.243 --> 20:49.378
what a man's gotta do.

20:49.379 --> 20:51.448
- We're back!
- Hey, honey! I'm back!

20:51.448 --> 20:54.040
- Thank God you made it!
- Hey, hey, hey.

20:54.451 --> 20:56.819
We have Kyle to thank for this.
If he hadn't jumped ship,

20:56.820 --> 20:58.921
we never would've known
we had it in us.

20:58.922 --> 21:01.690
No, no, no.
I think we have Jill to thank for this.

21:01.691 --> 21:02.892
- Oh, yeah.
- For making this one of the best

21:02.893 --> 21:06.862
- birthdays I ever had!
- Really?

21:06.863 --> 21:09.431
Having such a good time, I've decided
we should stay another day.

21:09.432 --> 21:10.566
Fine with me.

21:10.567 --> 21:14.434
Jill and I can spend tomorrow looking
for holy visions in the algae!

21:14.437 --> 21:16.870
Wow! How much fun that would be!

21:17.274 --> 21:20.376
But you know what?
My back is really better. It's better.

21:20.377 --> 21:22.745
I think I should join you tomorrow.

21:22.746 --> 21:24.371
All right!

21:29.819 --> 21:32.855
Hey, guys! We're home!

21:34.391 --> 21:35.584
Guys?

21:38.161 --> 21:41.026
Sorry that your back is still hurting you!

21:41.831 --> 21:43.058
Boys?

21:44.134 --> 21:46.301
Doesn't sound like they're home.

21:46.302 --> 21:50.100
- The place looks nice.
- Yeah. I told you we could trust them.

21:58.348 --> 22:00.747
Didn't we used to have a couch?

22:01.651 --> 22:04.016
You didn't pack that, did you?
