WE HAVE AN UPDATE.

05:54.410 --> 05:56.410
WE ARE TWO DAYS OUT,
AND PAUL KENDALL IS

05:56.410 --> 05:58.580
STILL LEADING LAURA BAKER
IN THE POLLS...

05:58.580 --> 06:00.750
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SEE,

06:00.750 --> 06:02.670
COURTESY OF
YOUR OPPONENT.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.500
CLASSY, EVEN INCLUDED
A SCREEN SHOT

06:06.500 --> 06:08.460
OF MINE AND BILLY'S
SEPARATION AGREEMENT.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.470
AS YOUR CAMPAIGN
MANAGER, IT IS
MY JOB TO GET AHEAD

06:10.470 --> 06:12.300
OF THESE THINGS,
BUT I CAN'T IF I'M
NOT MADE AWARE.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.720
WELL, I DECIDED TO KEEP
MY PERSONAL LIFE

06:14.720 --> 06:16.100
AND POLITICS SEPARATE.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.760
YOU LOST THAT LUXURY
THE SECOND

06:17.760 --> 06:19.100
YOU ANNOUNCED YOUR RUN
AGAINST PAUL KENDALL.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.600
NOW WE HAVE TO RESPOND

06:20.600 --> 06:22.350
BEFORE TOO MANY NARRATIVES
FABRICATE.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.270
LOOK, I'M THE REASON
FOR THE SEPARATION,
NOT LAURA,

06:24.270 --> 06:26.270
SO MAYBE I CAN DO AN
INTERVIEW OWNING UP

06:26.270 --> 06:27.900
TO EVERYTHING AND--
SHELBY: ACTUALLY, YES.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.900
WE CAN SPIN IT THAT
YOU GUYS HIT A ROCK,

06:29.900 --> 06:30.940
MANAGED TO CLIMB IT--

06:30.940 --> 06:32.200
YEAH, I DON'T THINK

06:32.200 --> 06:33.700
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.160
IT'S NO ONE'S
BUSINESS.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.780
PAUL KENDALL IS
TWICE-DIVORCED

06:36.780 --> 06:38.990
AND RECENTLY INTO
HIS THIRD MARRIAGE,

06:38.990 --> 06:41.620
YET I'M THE ONE WITH
THE MESSY HOME LIFE?

06:41.620 --> 06:43.000
NO.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.920
NO. LISTEN UP,
EVERYBODY.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.290
IGNORE ANY
AND ALL HITS

06:47.290 --> 06:49.800
BELOW THE BELT FROM
THE KENDALL CAMPAIGN.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.800
STICK TO TALKING POINTS
ON MY RECORD,

06:51.800 --> 06:53.970
MY PLATFORM, AND BEING
TOUGH ON CRIME,

06:53.970 --> 06:56.010
OK?

06:57.720 --> 07:00.390
MAN: 5 MINUTES.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.320

HAPPENED TO YOU?

TYRONE.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.570
HE'S BACK IN TOWN.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.570
HIS BOYS TRIED
TO PACK ME OUT

07:16.570 --> 07:18.240
ON THE YARD, BUT I FOUGHT
MY WAY UP OUT OF IT.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.240
YO, IS YOU SERIOUS?
YO, I GOT THIS.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.870
ME AND FLIP BEEN
WAITIN' ON TYRONE

07:21.870 --> 07:23.830
TO SNEAK HIS ASS
BACK IN TOWN.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.790
MAN, SIT
YOUR ASS DOWN.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.460
FLIP IS MISSIN'...

07:31.460 --> 07:32.800
WHAT?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.260
AND IT AIN'T
LOOKIN' GOOD.

07:34.260 --> 07:37.970
HE GOT AT ME.
HE GOT AT FLIP.

07:37.970 --> 07:40.180
YOU'RE NEXT.

07:40.180 --> 07:44.140
I NEED YOU TO LAY LOW,
TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION, COOP.

07:44.140 --> 07:45.770
YOU HEAR ME?

07:45.770 --> 07:48.940
YEAH.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.670
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

08:10.670 --> 08:12.300
PEACE AND QUIET.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.920
AND BETWEEN YOUR
HOUSE AND MINE, WE CAN

08:13.920 --> 08:15.510
BARELY GET AN HOUR
ALONE TOGETHER,

08:15.510 --> 08:17.680
AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THAT WE WERE NOT

08:17.680 --> 08:19.260
THE BEST VERSIONS
OF OURSELVES

08:19.260 --> 08:20.850
THE FIRST TIME

A PROPER RESET.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.230
BABY, THIS IS
SO SWEET,

08:28.230 --> 08:31.150

09:25.870 --> 09:28.160
ARE YOU USING STEROIDS?

09:31.670 --> 09:34.210

09:37.460 --> 09:39.470
NO, IT'S NOT--IT'S

09:39.470 --> 09:42.090
MM-MMM. I MEAN,
IF YOU DON'T THINK

09:42.090 --> 09:44.640
THAT YOU CAN PERFORM
WITHOUT IT,

09:44.640 --> 09:46.260
THAT'S AN ADDICTION
IN MY BOOK,

09:46.260 --> 09:48.890
SO, YEAH, IT'S
THE SAME THING.

09:48.890 --> 09:50.940
OK.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.650
OK. I'M DONE.
I PROMISE.

09:57.610 --> 10:00.400

10:02.410 --> 10:05.950
I CAN'T AFFORD

10:07.120 --> 10:08.700
OK.

10:10.790 --> 10:13.210
DR. FISKELL: YOU REMIND
ME OF A LION, SPENCER.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.330
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
YOUR LEFT ARM IS

10:15.330 --> 10:17.630
ABOUT 20% STRONGER
THAN YOUR RIGHT.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.090
THAT'S LIKELY
A DIRECT RESULT

10:19.090 --> 10:20.590
OF MUSCLE TISSUE
STILL HEALING.

10:20.590 --> 10:23.180
SO HE'S NOT READY
TO RETURN TO FOOTBALL.

10:23.180 --> 10:24.890
ON THE CONTRARY.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.890
YOUR SON'S 80%

10:26.890 --> 10:29.010
IS BETTER THAN
MOST PEOPLE'S 100%.

10:29.010 --> 10:31.430
THE REASON LIONS
HAVE SUCH HIGH
RECOVERY RATES

10:31.430 --> 10:33.890
IS BECAUSE THEY'RE
SOCIAL CREATURES WHO
PICK UP THE SLACK

10:33.890 --> 10:35.520
WHEN MEMBERS OF
THEIR PACK ARE DOWN.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.070
IT'S TIME SPENCER
RETURNS TO HIS TEAM,

10:38.070 --> 10:40.070
RECOUP HIS FULL STRENGTH
WITH THEIR SUPPORT.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.490
SO YOU'RE GONNA TELL
COACH BAKER I'M CLEAR
TO GET BACK?

10:42.490 --> 10:44.320
I'LL GIVE HIM
A CALL.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.160
HE CAN EASE YOU
BACK IN.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.530
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

10:48.530 --> 10:50.580
GRACE: THANK YOU.
SPENCER: AHEM.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.120
MA!

10:53.120 --> 10:55.080
BOY--THANK YOU.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.920
DOCTOR: THANK YOU.
GRACE: OK.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.340
COACH.

11:00.340 --> 11:02.420
BILLY: HEY.
SPENCER: WELL,

11:02.420 --> 11:03.720
YOU TALK TO
DR. FISKELL?

11:03.720 --> 11:05.840
DIDN'T YOU
JUST SEE HER?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.220
I MEAN, YEAH,
BUT A PHONE CALL

11:07.220 --> 11:08.220
IS, LIKE, TWO
SECONDS, RIGHT?

11:08.220 --> 11:10.100
YEAH, MAN, SHE CALLED.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.890
SO AM I GOOD TO GO
FOR OUR GAME AGAINST
CHATSWORTH TOMORROW?

11:12.890 --> 11:14.770
UH, THAT WOULD BE A NO.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.350
THE DOC AND I AGREED
THAT YOU'D BE GOOD
TO GO FOR PRACTICE.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.360
BUT YOU SAID MY POSITION
WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME
ONCE I'M CLEARED.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.150
GRACE: SPENCER, BABY--
SPENCER: ALL, RIGHT, LOOK,

11:21.150 --> 11:22.940
I HEARD
A RECRUITER FROM
COASTAL CALIFORNIA

11:22.940 --> 11:24.240
IS GONNA BE
AT THAT GAME.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.860
THAT WAS BARRY LEMMING,
ALL RIGHT?

11:25.860 --> 11:27.490
HIS SON BO PLAYS
FOR CHATSWORTH.

11:27.490 --> 11:29.490
HE'S THERE AS A DAD,
NOT AS A RECRUITER.

11:29.490 --> 11:31.080
THEY'RE ALWAYS
RECRUITING, COACH--

11:31.080 --> 11:32.790
YOU KNOW THAT--AND
WITH UCLA PULLING

11:32.790 --> 11:34.250
THEIR OFFER, I NEED
A CHANCE TO GET BACK

11:34.250 --> 11:36.460
ON COLLEGE RADARS.
COME ON.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.790
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS?

11:38.790 --> 11:40.790
WHY DON'T WE
RUN YOU THROUGH
SOME FOOTBALL TESTS,

11:40.790 --> 11:42.670
GAUGE THE STRENGTH
OF YOUR SHOULDER?

11:42.670 --> 11:44.420
YOU CAN GET UP TO SPEED
WITH THE NEW PLAYBOOK,

11:44.420 --> 11:46.590
THEN YOU CAN PLAY,
BUT IF NOT,

11:46.590 --> 11:48.590
YOU'RE ON
THE SIDELINES WITH ME.

11:48.590 --> 11:49.850
-ALL RIGHT. BET.
-OK?

11:49.850 --> 11:51.060
-YES, SIR.
-ALL RIGHT.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.680
MA.

11:53.890 --> 11:55.730
LAYLA.

11:55.730 --> 11:58.940
COOP, WHAT ARE YOU--
WAIT, DO WE HAVE
A SESSION TODAY?

11:58.940 --> 12:00.560
NO, BUT TYRONE
IS BACK IN TOWN

12:00.560 --> 12:02.730
AND I'M PRETTY DAMN SURE
HE'S COMING FOR ME,

12:02.730 --> 12:05.320
AND I KNOW YOUR DAD HAS
A SECURITY DETAIL, RIGHT?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.950
'CAUSE I JUST NEED
A SAFE PLACE TO HIDE

12:06.950 --> 12:08.410
FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL MY
PARENTS GET BACK IN TOWN.

12:08.410 --> 12:10.410
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I'LL CALL MY DAD.

12:10.410 --> 12:11.950
YOU CAN STAY AS
LONG AS YOU WANT.

12:11.950 --> 12:14.160
OK.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.930
WHAT Y'ALL DOING HERE?

12:35.930 --> 12:37.480
CANCELED PRACTICE
TODAY.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.850
I GUESS SOMETHING WAS UP
WITH THE FIELD.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.190
SO Y'ALL TOOK 3 BUSES
TO BEVERLY HILLS

12:40.190 --> 12:41.560
INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN
TO THE BEACH?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.360
THAT'S THE SAME
THING I SAID.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.940
HEH! THE BEACH WILL
BE THERE, BRO.

12:44.940 --> 12:46.860
YOU GETTING A CHANCE
TO PASS YOUR TEST TODAY,

12:46.860 --> 12:48.110
THAT'S
A DIFFERENT BEAST.

12:48.110 --> 12:49.860
I'M FINE, MAN.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.160
MY SHOULDER'S A-1.
LOT OF PEOPLE
COMPARE ME TO SIMBA.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.830
YOU DO KNOW SIMBA
AIN'T REAL, RIGHT?

12:53.830 --> 12:55.290
DID YOU NOT SEE
THE REMAKE?

12:55.290 --> 12:56.540
-ALL RIGHT.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.040
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.540
SINCE YOUR SHOULDER'S
HEALED, THEN,

12:59.540 --> 13:00.620
ALL WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
IS THE PLAYBOOK.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.290
"WE"?

13:02.290 --> 13:04.090
YEAH. WE GOT YOU.

13:04.090 --> 13:05.920
WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT FOOTBALL?

13:05.920 --> 13:08.130
I KNOW I'M ALMOST
AS GOOD AS YOU,

13:08.130 --> 13:10.010
ESPECIALLY WITH THAT
BUSTED SHOULDER.

13:10.010 --> 13:11.720
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
OOH, THAT HURT.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.510
-HA HA!
-OH, COME HERE. AH!

13:13.510 --> 13:16.140
DILLON: HA HA HA!

13:16.140 --> 13:18.140
SPENCER: I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

13:18.140 --> 13:21.230
DILLON: OK, OK. OK!
YOU'RE--YOU'RE BETTER!

13:25.860 --> 13:28.030
ALL RIGHT, DARNELL
KNOWS WHAT'S UP.

13:28.030 --> 13:29.400
HE'S KEEPING
SPENCER AND DILLON

13:29.400 --> 13:31.740
IN BEVERLY HILLS.
-OK, GOOD.

13:34.370 --> 13:37.160
OH, COOP, IT'S
THE DJ FROM 99.8.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.120
HE MIGHT BE CALLING
ABOUT THE TIME SLOT.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.750
OH, SHOOT.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.000
OK, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
HELLO? HELLO?

13:50.510 --> 13:52.930
-MR. KEATING, WHAT'S UP?
-HEY, COOP.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.550
THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR LETTING ME STAY.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.390
OH, NO DOUBT,
NO DOUBT, NO DOUBT.

13:56.390 --> 13:58.390
I KNOW FIRSTHAND
HOW THINGS CAN GET,

13:58.390 --> 14:00.390
SO DON'T YOU
WORRY, OK?
WE GOT YOU.

14:00.390 --> 14:02.480
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-HEY, LISTEN, UM,

14:02.480 --> 14:04.100
I'VE BEEN HEARING SOME
REALLY GOOD THINGS
ABOUT THIS SONG

14:04.100 --> 14:05.400
YOU AND LAYLA
ARE COOKIN' UP.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.070
YEAH, I THINK
IT'S MISSIN'

14:07.070 --> 14:09.150
A LITTLE SOMETHIN', BUT IT
DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.530
YEAH?
YOU GOT IT ON YOU?

14:10.530 --> 14:13.160
-YEAH.
-LET ME TAKE A LISTEN.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.870
COOP: ♪ YOU TOOK A SHOT
AT MY MAN ♪

14:15.870 --> 14:17.620
♪ NOW WAIT, YOU KNOW,
YOUR GUN IN MY HAND ♪

14:17.620 --> 14:19.620
♪ I WON'T TESTIFY,
AIN'T TAKIN' NO STAND ♪

14:19.620 --> 14:22.410
♪ ALL I SEE IS ME, ME,
ME, ME KILLIN' A MAN ♪

14:22.410 --> 14:24.420
♪ AND YOU CAN'T RUN FROM IT... ♪
-HA HA HA HA!

14:24.420 --> 14:27.920
OK, OK,
I'M DIGGIN' THIS.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.670
THE BEAT IS CATCHY.
THE FLOW IS CRAZY.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.470
I WOULDN'T CHANGE
A DAMN THING.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.970
REALLY?

14:33.970 --> 14:35.590
PSHH. NO DOUBT,
ESPECIALLY

14:35.590 --> 14:37.220
THOSE BARS
ABOUT ALMOST
LOSING SPENCER?

14:37.220 --> 14:38.470
-MM-HMM.
-OOH!

14:40.100 --> 14:42.100
YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE
STILL HERE, COOP?

14:42.100 --> 14:43.270
GOD.

14:43.270 --> 14:44.900
OH, NO DOUBT.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.770
THE OTHER REASON,
THOUGH, IS YOUR WILL.

14:47.770 --> 14:49.980
YEAH, SEE, NO MATTER
HOW SCARY THINGS GET

14:49.980 --> 14:51.740
IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU NEVER FOLD.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.950
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I LEARNED ABOUT YOU,

14:53.950 --> 14:55.950
YOU'RE NOT ONE
TO BACK DOWN

14:55.950 --> 14:59.330
FROM ANYTHING
OR ANYONE, EVER.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.370
I RESPECT THAT.

15:02.370 --> 15:04.290
-THANK YOU.
-HEY,

15:04.290 --> 15:05.920
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF YOU, ALL RIGHT?

15:05.920 --> 15:07.750
-THANK YOU.
-KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.800
-WILL DO.
-GO WORK ON SOME TRACKS NOW.

15:20.430 --> 15:24.060
SIMONE: HA HA HA!
YO, I'M DEAD.

15:24.060 --> 15:26.060
SO THIS CHICK WENT
TO "PEOPLE'S COURT"

15:26.060 --> 15:27.860
TO FIGHT
FOR HER MARRIAGE,
BUT THEN ADMITTED

15:27.860 --> 15:29.820
TO SLEEPING WITH
HER SIDE PIECE
THAT MORNING?

15:29.820 --> 15:31.570
FROM THIS POINT ON,
ANYTIME YOU HEAR ANYBODY

15:31.570 --> 15:33.320
SAYING SOMETHING WILD,
YOU HAVE TO REPLY WITH...

15:33.320 --> 15:34.650
BOTH: MISS JACKSON.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.820
SIMONE: HA HA HA!

15:38.030 --> 15:39.950
HEY, YOU OK?

15:39.950 --> 15:42.330
YEAH. IT'S MY MOM.

15:42.330 --> 15:44.750
SHE'S LITERALLY
BEEN BUGGING ME

15:44.750 --> 15:47.330
ABOUT GOING SHOPPING,
AND I'M RUNNING
OUT OF EXCUSES.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.960
IT'S THE SPRING, SIMONE.
BALENCIAGAS AND TRACK
SUITS ARE STILL THE WAVE.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.800
JORDAN,
I'M SERIOUS.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.760
OK, WELL, WHY NOT
JUST COME CLEAN?

15:54.760 --> 15:56.970
BECAUSE MY PARENTS
ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

15:56.970 --> 15:59.180
THAT MADE ME DO
A RESEARCH REPORT
ON FRANK OCEAN

15:59.180 --> 16:01.390
TO PROVE WHY IT'D BE SAFE
TO GO TO HIS CONCERT.

16:01.390 --> 16:03.640
SO JUST IMAGINE HOW,
"OH, HEY,

16:03.640 --> 16:05.730
I'M PREGGO"
IS GONNA GO.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.600
WHAT IF I WAS THERE
WHENEVER YOU TELL THEM?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.650
STRICTLY AS A FRIEND.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.570
-ABSOLUTELY NOT.
-WHY NOT?

16:11.570 --> 16:12.860
MAYBE THEY'LL TAKE
IT EASIER ON YOU

16:12.860 --> 16:14.650
WITH SOMEBODY
ELSE THERE.

16:14.650 --> 16:16.950
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT WOULD BE
BETTER OR WORSE.

16:16.950 --> 16:19.570
AT LEAST IT'LL BE OVER WITH
AND YOU CAN MOVE ON.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.990
GUESS WHAT.
THE STATION WANTS TO RUN

16:22.990 --> 16:26.000
YOUR TRACK EARLY,
LIKE TOMORROW.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.250
COOP?

16:34.380 --> 16:35.420
COOP?

16:43.850 --> 16:45.470
HEY.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.100
DID ANYBODY STOP BY?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.480
OK. HI TO YOU, TOO.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.600
YES OR NO?

16:51.600 --> 16:54.360
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS YET.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.070
SO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:01.200 --> 17:03.530
TYRONE IS BACK
IN TOWN,

17:03.530 --> 17:06.660
AND HE'S EITHER COMING
FOR ME OR SOMEBODY I LOVE.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.660
JUST TO BE SAFE,

17:08.660 --> 17:10.620
I THINK IT'S BEST IF WE
DIP UP OUT OF HERE.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.540
YOU GOT A UNCLE
IN RIVERSIDE, RIGHT?

17:12.540 --> 17:14.750
-YEAH.
-YOU THINK HE'D LET US
STAY FOR A FEW DAYS?

17:14.750 --> 17:18.130
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN SEE, LIKE--

17:18.130 --> 17:20.420
ALL RIGHT, CALL HIM.
I'M GONNA USE YOUR
BATHROOM REAL QUICK.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.470
OK.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.240
OH, GO AHEAD.

17:47.990 --> 17:50.830
PATIENCE: HEY.
SPENCER: LAYLA CALLED ME.

17:50.830 --> 17:53.250
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU AIN'T TELL ME
TYRONE WAS BACK.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.130
-NO, I WAS GONNA HIT YOU LATER.
-YOU OUT YOUR DAMN MIND?

17:55.130 --> 17:56.840
IF I CAN FIND YOU THIS EASY,
WHAT MAKES YOU

17:56.840 --> 17:58.340
THINK TYRONE CAN'T?
LOOK, Y'ALL NEED

17:58.340 --> 18:00.130
TO BOUNCE,
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.760
WE ARE, AS SOON
AS PATIENCE IS DONE
PACKING HER BAGS.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.380
WE'RE GOING TO
HER UNCLE'S HOUSE
IN RIVERSIDE.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.390
YOU NEED TO GET BACK
TO BEVERLY HILLS

18:05.390 --> 18:07.140
NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S
SAFER, BUT DON'T YOU GOT

18:07.140 --> 18:08.970
A FOOTBALL TEST
WITH COACH BAKER?

18:08.970 --> 18:11.180
-THE TEST CAN WAIT, A'IGHT?
-NO, IF YOU DON'T PASS,

18:11.180 --> 18:14.400
YOU DON'T PLAY TOMORROW,
AND IF YOU DON'T PLAY,
YOU MISS OUT ON RECRUITERS.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.520
WE'LL BE FINE, BRO.
TRUST.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.570
I WILL TEXT YOU
THE MINUTE WE GET THERE.

18:22.570 --> 18:24.570
YOU BETTER.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.070
PATIENCE: BYE.

18:38.540 --> 18:41.300
ALL RIGHT, YOU SHOULD GET
GOING NOW. I'LL MEET YOU
AT YOUR UNCLE'S.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.720
WHAT? NO. YOU JUST
TOLD SPENCER WE'RE
GOING TOGETHER.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.590
I'LL BE RIGHT
BEHIND YOU, I PROMISE.

18:45.590 --> 18:47.680
-MY GOD.
-LOOK, DON'T. COME ON.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.640
I'LL BE THERE.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.890
ALL RIGHT.

18:55.850 --> 18:58.480
OLIVIA: OK, COOP IS
PROBABLY ALREADY HALFWAY
TO RIVERSIDE BY NOW.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.400
YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST
THE TIMING OF IT ALL.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.030
LIKE, SHE HAS
A SONG ABOUT TO
DROP ON THE RADIO.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.530
SHE SHOULD BE HERE
TO ENJOY IT.

19:03.530 --> 19:05.530
I MEAN, THAT SONG IS
AMAZING, BUT IT'S GONNA

19:05.530 --> 19:07.660
BE AROUND FOR A WHILE,
OK, SAME AS COOP.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.700
YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.500
EVERYTHING OK?

19:16.960 --> 19:19.960
WOULD YOU KEEP A SECRET
FOR SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT

19:19.960 --> 19:22.170
IF YOU KNEW IT WASN'T
FOR THE BEST?

19:22.170 --> 19:24.920
YOU'VE GOT GOOD INSTINCTS.
YOU SHOULD TRUST YOUR GUT.

19:26.510 --> 19:28.510
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?
-NOPE.

19:28.510 --> 19:30.510
NOPE, ALL GOOD.
PROMISE.

19:30.510 --> 19:32.560
PAUL, ON TV: AS A LITIGATOR,
LAURA BAKER

19:32.560 --> 19:34.560
IS DECENT AT HER JOB,

19:34.560 --> 19:36.190
BUT COME ON.

19:36.190 --> 19:38.190
THAT COLD,
INACCESSIBLE PERSONA?

19:38.190 --> 19:40.520
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT
HER MARRIAGE IS ON THE ROCKS.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.730
SHE'S ABOUT TO BE
A SINGLE MOTHER

19:42.730 --> 19:45.950
FOR TWO TEENAGERS WHO REALLY
NEED HER HELP, SO YOU...

19:45.950 --> 19:47.950
MOM, I'M HAPPY
TO GO ON MY PODCAST

19:47.950 --> 19:49.870
AND WAGE WAR
WITH THIS DOUCHE.

19:49.870 --> 19:51.620
I APPRECIATE THAT,
SWEETIE, BUT THE

19:51.620 --> 19:53.910
LAST THING YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT IS ME.

19:53.910 --> 19:56.540
PAUL, ON TV: I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED SOMEONE IN OFFICE...
LAURA: OH, MY GOD.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.540
WOW, AND THAT SEXIST B.S.
RIGHT THERE IS PRECISELY

19:59.540 --> 20:02.960
THE REASON WHY I COULD
NEVER GO INTO POLITICS.

20:14.220 --> 20:16.230
ROBERT: AHEM.

20:16.230 --> 20:18.640
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
SIMONE DATING SOMEONE

20:18.640 --> 20:20.230
WITHOUT TATTOOS.

20:20.230 --> 20:23.440
-MOM.
-IT'S AN HONEST OBSERVATION.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.280
ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU INVITED US

20:26.280 --> 20:28.700
TO THIS SPORTS BAR?

20:28.700 --> 20:30.700
UM...

20:30.700 --> 20:33.580
SIMONE,
YOU WANT TO...

20:35.160 --> 20:37.790
SO, I'M...

20:37.790 --> 20:41.460
ACTUALLY HERE
BECAUSE...

20:46.130 --> 20:48.170
WELL, I'M PREGNANT.

20:53.930 --> 20:55.930
CAN YOU SAY
SOMETHING?

20:55.930 --> 20:58.480
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
A SHOO-IN AT STANFORD,

20:58.480 --> 21:00.060
AND YOU'RE GONNA THROW
YOUR WHOLE FUTURE--

21:00.060 --> 21:01.560
LET'S NOT JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.940
I'M SURE THIS WAS MEANT
TO BE A DISCUSSION.

21:02.940 --> 21:04.690
JORDAN:
YES. BASICALLY,

21:04.690 --> 21:06.690
SIMONE HAS JUST
REALLY BEEN STR--
TINA: DID YOU NOT

21:06.690 --> 21:09.610
CARE ENOUGH TO USE
PROTECTION?

21:09.610 --> 21:11.610
-BEG YOUR PARDON?
-ISN'T THERE ENOUGH DRAMA

21:11.610 --> 21:13.700
IN YOUR FAMILY ALREADY?
ROBERT: TINA, LET'S NOT

21:13.700 --> 21:16.200
BRING HIS PARENTS'
MARRIAGE TROUBLES
INTO ALL OF THIS.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.120
TINA: OH, ROBERT,
IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS,

21:18.120 --> 21:20.330
AND I'M SURE THE LAST THING
THEY WANT IS SOME NEW CHILD

21:20.330 --> 21:23.040
COMING INTO
THEIR BROKEN FAMILY.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.750
JORDAN IS HERE
AS MY FRIEND.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.340
HE'S NOT
THE BABY'S FATHER.

21:28.340 --> 21:31.760
WELL, IF THIS YOUNG MAN
ISN'T THE FATHER, THEN WHO--

21:33.260 --> 21:36.470
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:36.470 --> 21:39.100
HMM! DOESN'T MATTER,
SWEETHEART,

21:39.100 --> 21:41.100
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT KEEPING IT.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.650
WELL, THAT'S NOT
YOUR DECISION.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.520
YOU WANT TO LIVE
IN OUR HOUSE,

21:44.520 --> 21:47.070

21:54.570 --> 21:56.580
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

21:56.580 --> 21:59.040
HEY, DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR SHOULDER TEST
RIGHT NOW?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.700

I'M RUSHING IT?

22:00.700 --> 22:02.160

UNDERWAY.

29:37.660 --> 29:39.160
STAGING A BIG
PRESS INTERVIEW

29:39.160 --> 29:40.830
WHILE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
HEADING TO THE POLLS

29:40.830 --> 29:42.500
COULD OPEN A WHOLE CAN
OF WORMS THAT WE WON'T

29:42.500 --> 29:44.420
HAVE TIME TO ADDRESS
BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSE.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.830
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT I NEED

29:45.830 --> 29:47.840
TO SHOW
MY CONSTITUENTS

29:47.840 --> 29:49.710
AND MY DAUGHTER
THAT THIS SORT

29:49.710 --> 29:51.590
OF FEMALE BULLYING
IS NOT OK.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.220
BUT WHAT IF VOTERS
DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE

29:53.220 --> 29:55.140
TO SAY, AND IT COSTS
YOU THE ELECTION?

29:55.140 --> 29:58.680
WELL, THEN AT LEAST I CAN
BOW OUT WITH DIGNITY.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.890
AND 3, 2, 1.

30:05.900 --> 30:09.820
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS TIME
TO ADDRESS MY SILENCE.

30:09.820 --> 30:12.030
OFTEN, AS WOMEN,

30:12.030 --> 30:14.360
OUR SILENCE IS
MISCONSTRUED

30:14.360 --> 30:16.360
AS WEAKNESS.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.370
THE TRUTH IS,
IS WE WERE

30:18.370 --> 30:20.490
OFTEN MAKING
THE STRONGER CHOICE

30:20.490 --> 30:23.120
TO JUST NOT ENGAGE.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.920
I WAS REMINDED THAT,
AS A PUBLIC FIGURE,

30:26.920 --> 30:29.250
THAT THIS ISN'T
JUST ABOUT ME.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.250
THIS IS
ABOUT THE LEGACY

30:31.250 --> 30:33.720
OF WOMEN
IN THIS COUNTRY.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.930
THIS IS ABOUT LITTLE GIRLS
WHO DREAMED OF GOING

30:35.930 --> 30:38.720
INTO POLITICS ONE DAY
WHO ARE NOW RETHINKING IT

30:38.720 --> 30:41.720
BECAUSE OF BULLIES
LIKE PAUL KENDALL,

30:41.720 --> 30:45.730
SO I AM BREAKING
MY SILENCE.

30:45.730 --> 30:48.730
WHILE IT'S TRUE
THAT MY HUSBAND AND I

30:48.730 --> 30:50.940
HAVE FILED
FOR SEPARATION,

30:50.940 --> 30:54.820
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT IT IS
NONE OF ANYONE'S BUSINESS.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.820
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY ABILITY TO RUN

30:56.820 --> 30:58.820
AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY,
AND IF I WERE A MAN,

30:58.820 --> 31:01.200
THAT IS WHAT YOU
WOULD BE VOTING ON.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.040
I REFUSE TO BE HELD
TO A DOUBLE STANDARD

31:04.040 --> 31:06.040
BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN,

31:06.040 --> 31:10.630
SO, ELECT ME OR DON'T,

31:10.630 --> 31:13.590
BUT MAKE YOUR DECISION
BASED ON MY PLATFORM

31:13.590 --> 31:16.420
AND TRACK RECORD,
NOT MY OPPONENT

31:16.420 --> 31:18.430
THROWING MY LIFE
INTO THE MEDIA

31:18.430 --> 31:21.050
AS A WAY
TO UNDERCUT ME.

31:21.050 --> 31:23.770
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
THAT TRACK RECORD.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.530
-COACH, LISTEN.
-UH-UH.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.530
WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO SAY TO ME,

31:42.530 --> 31:45.790
YOU CAN SAY
TO THE REST OF
YOUR TEAMMATES.

31:45.790 --> 31:47.790
-COACH, COME ON.
-GO ON.

31:59.470 --> 32:01.140
YO.

32:03.300 --> 32:05.720
TODAY WAS ON ME.
NOT ONLY DID I ALMOST

32:05.720 --> 32:09.140
COST US THE GAME, BUT I
SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN
ON THAT FIELD.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.690
HEY, IT WAS A FREAK
ACCIDENT, BRO.

32:11.690 --> 32:14.270
J.J.: DON'T BEAT
YOURSELF UP.
WE STILL WON.

32:14.270 --> 32:16.280
IT WASN'T
A FREAK ACCIDENT, MAN.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.900
THE TRUTH IS, MY SHOULDER
AIN'T 100%, AND

32:18.900 --> 32:21.910
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
IT NEVER WILL BE.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.450
AND I'M SCARED, MAN.

32:26.450 --> 32:28.460
SPENCE, WE ALL
UNDERSTAND

32:28.460 --> 32:30.460
THAT FEELING,
ALL RIGHT?

32:30.460 --> 32:32.210
YOU SHOULD'VE
JUST TRUSTED US

32:32.210 --> 32:33.960
ENOUGH TO TELL US
BEFORE THE GAME.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.250
YEAH, 'CAUSE WE'RE
FAMILY, BUT WE CAN'T

32:36.250 --> 32:38.920
PROTECT YOU ON THE FIELD
WHEN YOU'RE VULNERABLE
IF WE DON'T KNOW.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.840
BUT NOW WE DO,

32:40.840 --> 32:42.760
AND, LOOK,
WE GOT YOU.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.550
J.J.: YEAH, ON
AND OFF THE FIELD--

32:44.550 --> 32:47.520
REHAB, WORKOUTS,
FILM STUDY.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.810
LOOK, MAN, WE'RE GONNA
HELP YOU GET BACK

32:48.810 --> 32:50.100
ON THAT FIELD AGAIN
AND DOMINATE,

32:50.100 --> 32:51.100
ALL RIGHT, JUST
LIKE OLD TIMES,

32:51.100 --> 32:52.560
RIGHT, FELLAS?

32:52.560 --> 32:54.230
-YEAH.
-YEAH, FELLAS.

32:59.280 --> 33:02.160
I GUESS A LION IS ONLY
AS GOOD AS HIS PACK.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.410
-YEAH.
-WHOO!

33:04.410 --> 33:06.410
J.J.: GOT YOU, BROTHER.

33:13.670 --> 33:15.710
I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING OUT.

33:15.710 --> 33:17.920
I ADMIT, I ONLY CAME
TO SEE MY SON PLAY

33:17.920 --> 33:20.340
AND MAYBE SPENCER JAMES,
BUT YOU--

33:20.340 --> 33:22.010
ABSOLUTE BEAST.

33:22.010 --> 33:25.260
THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.010
HEY, WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
COME IN FOR A VISIT.

33:28.430 --> 33:30.430
YES, SIR.

33:30.430 --> 33:32.850
THANK YOU.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.020
HEY!

33:38.020 --> 33:40.400
SORRY I MISSED THE GAME.
ASHER: HEY.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.450
UM, I HEARD YOU
CRUSHED IT, THOUGH.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.450
HEY, IT'S ALL GOOD.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.290
I KNOW IT'S
YOUR MOM'S BIG DAY.

33:49.290 --> 33:52.830
SPEAKING OF THAT,
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.460
CONTAIN YOUR
EXCITEMENT.

34:09.390 --> 34:12.350
ASH, YOU OK?

34:12.350 --> 34:14.980
ASH, YOU OK?

34:14.980 --> 34:16.980
YEAH.

34:16.980 --> 34:18.980
YEAH, I JUST, UH...

34:18.980 --> 34:21.280
I JUST GOT
SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.700
THAT GUY THAT
JUST LEFT,

34:23.700 --> 34:26.160
HE'S THE LEAD RECRUITER
FOR COASTAL CALIFORNIA.

34:26.160 --> 34:29.160
HE INVITED ME OUT
FOR A VISIT.
HOW AWESOME IS THAT?

34:29.160 --> 34:32.370
THAT'S, UM,
REALLY,

34:32.370 --> 34:35.120
UH, REALLY
GREAT, BABE.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.130
DO YOU WANT TO GO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

34:38.130 --> 34:41.130
ACTUALLY, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET HOME.

34:41.130 --> 34:44.050
THOSE POLLS ARE
CLOSING SOON, SO

34:44.050 --> 34:45.550
I'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER, OK?

34:45.550 --> 34:47.590
YEAH.

34:58.860 --> 35:02.150
HEY.

35:02.150 --> 35:04.150
HAVE YOU GIVEN
YOUR, UM,

35:04.150 --> 35:06.150
YOUR PARENTS' OFFER
ANY MORE THOUGHT?

35:06.150 --> 35:08.910
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT...

35:08.910 --> 35:11.530
MY DECISION STANDS.

35:11.530 --> 35:13.910
NO. YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

35:13.910 --> 35:16.920
I MEAN, KIND OF.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.040
THE ONLY OTHER OPTION
I HAVE TO LIVE IS

35:19.040 --> 35:21.630
WITH A SECOND COUSIN
IN KENTUCKY.

35:21.630 --> 35:23.760
-MISS JACKSON.
-HA HA HA!

35:23.760 --> 35:26.550
HA HA HA!

35:26.550 --> 35:29.180
YOU KNOW, I WAS
RECENTLY REMINDED

35:29.180 --> 35:32.180
THAT BEING THERE
FOR SOMEONE MEANS

35:32.180 --> 35:35.140
STANDING BY THEIR SIDE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

35:35.140 --> 35:37.440
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

35:37.440 --> 35:41.650
I'M SAYING
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
MOVE TO KENTUCKY.

35:43.230 --> 35:44.860
BILLY: I SHOULD'VE
LISTENED TO MY GUT

35:44.860 --> 35:46.490
AND NOT LET YOU
PLAY TODAY.

35:46.490 --> 35:48.110
MY BAD, COACH.

35:48.110 --> 35:49.780
THE LAST THING I WANTED
TO DO WAS WATCH YOU MAKE

35:49.780 --> 35:51.280
THE SAME MISTAKE
I MADE WHEN I TRIED

35:51.280 --> 35:53.700
TO COME BACK TOO EARLY
AFTER MY KNEE INJURY.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.700
YO, MY REHAB'S
GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.870
-OH, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
-YEAH, I DO.

35:57.870 --> 35:59.460
I HAVE MY MOMS,

35:59.460 --> 36:01.460
I HAVE MY FAMILY,

36:01.460 --> 36:04.840
I HAVE MY TEAMMATES...

36:04.840 --> 36:07.050
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

36:07.050 --> 36:09.680
I HAVE YOU.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.550
LOOK, I WANT TO
FIX MY SHOULDER
THE RIGHT WAY,

36:13.550 --> 36:16.560
SO WHATEVER
YOU NEED ME TO DO,
I'M DOWN TO DOING.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.640
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

36:18.640 --> 36:21.270
'CAUSE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
IN THIS JAMBOREE NEXT MONTH,

36:21.270 --> 36:23.440
I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR TOTAL COMMITMENT.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.940
-NOT A PROBLEM.
-AIN'T GONNA BE EASY.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.480
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE SOME SACRIFICES...

36:26.480 --> 36:28.490
ALL RIGHT. BET.

36:28.490 --> 36:31.610
LIKE POSSIBLY
SWITCHING POSITIONS.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.240
YEAH.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.460
OK.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.710
LIKE I SAID,

36:47.710 --> 36:49.760
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

37:02.230 --> 37:03.810
WOMAN, ON TV:
AND, FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND,

37:03.810 --> 37:06.770
WE HAVE NUMBERS
ROLLING IN SLOWLY...

37:06.770 --> 37:08.230

37:33.880 --> 37:35.890
I'M HERE TO REPORT

38:13.090 --> 38:15.340

38:15.340 --> 38:17.720
-NO, ALL GOOD HERE.
-OH. OK.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.020
SIMONE: HEY.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.770
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'D I MISS?

38:27.980 --> 38:29.980
PATIENCE: I'VE BEEN

38:29.980 --> 38:32.190
LOOK, I KNOW
HOW IT LOOKS,

38:32.190 --> 38:33.610
BUT IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING, OK?

38:33.610 --> 38:35.200
NO, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

38:35.200 --> 38:37.070
THAT YOU CAME TO MY
HOUSE FOR ONE REASON

38:37.070 --> 38:38.240
AND ONE REASON ONLY.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.080
-WHAT?
-TO GET THAT GUN.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.160
YEAH, YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULDN'T CHECK?

38:43.950 --> 38:46.960
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
POINT-BLANK,

38:46.960 --> 38:49.750
AND I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BE REAL HONEST
WITH ME, TAMIA.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.250
OK.

38:51.250 --> 38:53.130
DID YOU KILL TYRONE?

38:53.130 --> 38:54.300
NO.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.920
STOP LYING.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.430
I'M NOT LYING.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.350
FLIP. WHOA,
WHERE YOU BEEN?

39:01.350 --> 39:02.930
I HAD TO GET
MY FAMILY OUT OF TOWN

39:02.930 --> 39:06.020
SO I COULD GET TYRONE
THE WAR HE WANTED.

39:09.860 --> 39:11.150
MAN: TAMIA COOPER?

39:11.150 --> 39:12.520
