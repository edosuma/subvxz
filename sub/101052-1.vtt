<i>-PHIL: Annie?</i>
<i>-ANNIE: Oh, God,</i>

40:39.395 --> 40:42.398
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this day for a long time.</i>

40:42.481 --> 40:45.192
{\an5}<i>-PHIL: What?</i>
<i>-ANNIE: I told you</i>
<i>it was complicated.</i>

40:45.276 --> 40:47.153
<i>PHIL:</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:48.821
{\an5}<i>ANNIE:</i>
<i>This was about a better future</i>
<i>for me and Audra.</i>

40:48.904 --> 40:50.573
Thank you so much.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.032
{\an5}<i>PHIL:</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>What are you...</i>

40:52.116 --> 40:53.409
<i>What is happening here?</i>

40:53.492 --> 40:56.412
<i>ANNIE:</i>
<i>You were my escape hatch, Phil.</i>

40:56.495 --> 40:58.998
<i>You saved us.</i>

40:59.081 --> 41:04.044
<i>Now my life can finally begin,</i>
<i>all because of you.</i>

41:04.128 --> 41:06.255
<i>PHIL:</i>
<i>No. No. No.</i>

41:06.338 --> 41:08.048
<i>Oh, my God, you are a monster.</i>

41:08.132 --> 41:11.552
<i>You-- You're-- you lied to me!</i>

41:11.635 --> 41:14.930
<i>ANNIE:</i>
<i>No, not really.</i>

41:15.014 --> 41:18.392
<i>All I ever did was tell you</i>
<i>what you wanted to hear,</i>

41:18.475 --> 41:21.937
<i>and you were willing</i>
<i>to kill for it.</i>

41:22.021 --> 41:26.066
<i>I told you, you had a purpose.</i>

41:26.150 --> 41:28.152
<i>Goodbye, Phil.</i>

41:30.321 --> 41:32.198
No, oh, no!

41:32.281 --> 41:33.908
NARRATOR:
What kind of compromise goes

41:33.991 --> 41:36.243
into connecting
with another human being?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.078
Is it meeting in the middle?

41:38.162 --> 41:41.582
Or going all the way
to the end of the line?

41:41.665 --> 41:43.417
Philip Hayes found connection

41:43.500 --> 41:47.213
but only with the darkest part
of his soul.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.048
A region of self
that he'll inhabit

41:49.131 --> 41:50.925
for the rest of his life.

41:51.008 --> 41:54.261
Here, in The Twilight Zone.
