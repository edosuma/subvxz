WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:04.404
( bell rings )

00:04.437 --> 00:07.374
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.407 --> 00:10.276
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.310 --> 00:13.179
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.213 --> 00:16.850
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>

00:16.883 --> 00:22.455
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:25.492
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:28.461
<i>* And my dog ate</i>

00:28.495 --> 00:31.331

00:31.364 --> 00:35.068

00:35.101 --> 00:38.938
<i>* It's all right</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:56.122
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:56.156 --> 00:59.125
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:59.159 --> 01:03.096
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:19.913
There he is.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.549
Come on, the basketball rally
starts in a few minutes.
Let's go!

01:22.582 --> 01:25.552
I can't think basketball
until I finish
this take-home test.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.921
You've got to be there,
you're the captain.

01:27.954 --> 01:31.224
Don't worry, I'm sending
somebody else in my place.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.326
Call me Air Zack.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.629
"Air Nerd" is more like it.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.599
Come on, Zack, we don't want
to get booed at our own rally.

01:39.632 --> 01:42.936
Zack, wasn't this math
take-home test
due last Friday?

01:42.969 --> 01:45.271
Yeah, but I told Mr. Dewey
my house burned down.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.541
Simple...
no home, no take-home.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.944
Lisa, where is your
cheerleading outfit?

01:50.977 --> 01:52.278
We have to go to the rally.

01:52.312 --> 01:55.281
I'm not going to
the rally because
my mother the "doctor" agrees

01:55.315 --> 01:58.418
with my father the "doctor"
that I should volunteer
as a candystriper.

01:58.451 --> 02:02.322
You got a job painting stripes
on candy canes?

02:02.355 --> 02:03.890
What's with the blonde wig?

02:03.923 --> 02:07.160
Is there a Swedish
Dork convention in town?

02:07.193 --> 02:10.295
Lisa, helping other people
is a beautiful selfless act.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.399
Ugh, now you sound
like my mother.

02:12.432 --> 02:16.069
She says volunteering
at the hospital will make me
a "better person."

02:16.102 --> 02:21.241
If you want to be a better
person, you can start by
taking my algebra test.

02:21.274 --> 02:24.144
Zack: Okay team,
make room for the coach.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.916
Time for
the pre-game pep talk.
Gather around here, men.

02:29.949 --> 02:33.586
Okay... this is
the championship game.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.889
Wait a minute. That's it?

02:35.922 --> 02:37.323
That's the whole pep talk?

02:37.357 --> 02:40.160
Oh yeah... win, too.

02:40.193 --> 02:44.097
Excuse me, Coach.
May I interject
a few inspirational words?

02:44.097 --> 02:46.499
Why?
I've already got them pumped.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.336
Guys...

02:49.369 --> 02:52.105
I don't want to talk to you
about basketball.

02:52.138 --> 02:55.542
Then why are you
bothering us?

02:55.575 --> 02:58.211
I want to talk to you
about life.

02:58.244 --> 03:01.348
Men, basketball
is a metaphor for life.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.551
Well, the basket: our goal.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.520
The ball:
our hopes and dreams.

03:07.554 --> 03:10.890
The backboard is a chance
to rebound from those
missed opportunities.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.059
Hey, Mr. B,
what about lay-up drills?

03:13.093 --> 03:14.828
Lay-up drills
could be, uh...

03:14.861 --> 03:16.830
Sir, we've got
to do lay-up drills.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.164
The game is going to start.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.301
Oh! Well, then to sum up,
let's go do it!

03:21.334 --> 03:23.069
( cheering )

03:23.069 --> 03:24.971
- One more thing...
- ( Zack groans )

03:25.071 --> 03:27.440
- Preppie, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I got it.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.376
( Zack cries out )
No! I can't.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.112
Somebody go get the nurse!
Go, go.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.150
- ( door bangs )
- Ow, Screech!

03:37.183 --> 03:39.252
Heads up! Look out!
Lady with a baby!

03:39.285 --> 03:40.854
Screech, slow down.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.922
X-ray is supposed to be
around here somewhere.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.124
Wow, Lisa is here.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.394
She must have hurt herself
at the candy striping factory.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.230
What are you guys doing here?
What happened to Zack?

03:50.263 --> 03:51.564
It was just a little accident.

03:51.598 --> 03:55.935
See, Zack and I, well, we just
kind of bumped
into each other.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.271
- During the game?
- No, in the locker room.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.206
I twisted my knee.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.343
Don't say another word
until we talk to my Uncle
Shyster the lawyer.

04:03.376 --> 04:07.347
By this time next year
you'll own Bayside.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.581
Lisa, we're
looking for X-ray.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.216
X-ray is
right through there.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.219
Thank goodness.
Screech,
let Lisa take over now!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.155
No way!
I don't do wheelchairs.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.425
Screech,
roll Zack through that door,
I'll get my mother.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.161
You just better hope he lives.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.829
( screams )

04:22.862 --> 04:24.264
Sorry, Zack.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.839
PA announcement:
<i>Dr. Carrow, surgery please.</i>

04:36.643 --> 04:38.578
Zack!
You're alive?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.980
You're alive!
( tearfully )

04:42.182 --> 04:43.850
Mom, is Zack going
to be all right?

04:43.883 --> 04:46.586
Yes, but I'm afraid
he's really hurt his knee.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.389
I'd like to keep him overnight
so we can run some tests.

04:49.422 --> 04:53.259
Oh, Zack that's awful.
Won't you be scared?

04:58.231 --> 05:00.867
No, I think I'll manage.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.569
( Zack groans )

05:02.602 --> 05:05.105
Lisa, I think you have
other work to do.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.142
Oh yes,
I just can't wait to get back
to re-tipping those crutches.

05:09.175 --> 05:12.045
Young lady, we are not here
just to have fun.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.413
Now after you check Zack in,

05:13.446 --> 05:16.216
run up to pediatrics
and help change diapers.

05:16.249 --> 05:19.152
Oh, then see if you can
find Mrs. Fikes' false teeth.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.421
Why do I have to
do all that work
when this place

05:21.454 --> 05:23.890
is full of people lying around
doing nothing?

05:23.923 --> 05:28.128
Because it's time for you
to learn some responsibility.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.863
We'll see you later, okay?

05:29.896 --> 05:32.065
- Goodbye, Mr. Belding.
- Goodbye, you guys.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.067
- Bye.
- See you, Lisa.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.069
This is all my fault.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.071
Zack, is there anything
that I can do?

05:38.071 --> 05:41.875
- Uh...
yeah. You can call my mom.
- I already did.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.077
I'll go wait for her
in the parking lot.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.312
And if there's anything else,
you just name it.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.083
Oh sure, try and smooth
things over
with the plaintiff.

05:50.116 --> 05:53.620
You know, sir...
I am sort of struggling
with my math take-home test,

05:53.653 --> 05:56.456
and I'd hate to fail it
because of a recent accident.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.991
It was no accident.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.527
It's obvious to everyone
you never liked him.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.197
- That's not true.
- Well, prove it. Do the math.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.232
Uh, sure, Zack.
I'll take care of it.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.834
- Okay.
- Anything else?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.936
You can take
my French test tomorrow.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.271
I never took French.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.040
And you call
yourself a principal.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.045
All right.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.880
Kelly: Zack, is there
anything else I
can do for you?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.582
Books, magazines, videotapes?

06:22.615 --> 06:25.418
How about a broccoli slurpee?

06:25.452 --> 06:28.922
Uh... no thanks.
I got everything I need.
Thank you.

06:28.955 --> 06:31.591
So, who's going to tell me
about the game?

06:31.624 --> 06:34.461
Slater, why don't you
give him the good news?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.264
I didn't want
to bum you out, Preppie,

06:38.298 --> 06:40.300
- but we lost by a point.
- ( groans )

06:40.333 --> 06:42.535
I had the ball with
three seconds left.

06:42.569 --> 06:46.873
Then Belding starts yelling,
"Shoot your hopes and dreams."

06:46.906 --> 06:49.075
By the time I realized
he meant the ball

06:49.075 --> 06:51.311
the game was over.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.514
We ought to sue him
for that, too.

06:54.547 --> 06:57.083
- ( woman groans )
- What was that?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.120
Probably some poor person
in terrible pain.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.489
It's Lisa.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.125
She looks exhausted.
Her hair's a mess.

07:05.158 --> 07:09.195
All I have to
say is my children
better be born potty-trained.

07:10.563 --> 07:13.500
- How's my favorite patient?
- Oh, fine, Monique.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.269
Except for that pesky cramp
in my lower neck.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.338
You're not sick,
you're dangerous.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.107
- But I'll take the risk.
- ( Zack sighs )

07:21.141 --> 07:25.311
You know... my neck has
been cramping up a lot lately.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.883
- Feel better?
- Perfect.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.153
Keep her around
in case you choke on a bone.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.221
( bell rings )

07:35.255 --> 07:38.091
Sorry guys,
visiting hours are over.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.428
We'll be back tomorrow
right after school, okay?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.064
All right, Screech,
let's rock and roll.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.598
See you later, Zack.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.334
( Lisa gasps )

07:48.601 --> 07:50.537
Thanks, Monique,
that's much better.

07:50.570 --> 07:54.274
But I'm sure it will cramp up
again later.
Say around... 9:00?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.344
You're faster than a guy
with two good legs.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.212
Hey, Zack.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.216
Well, I have
some news for you.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.418
- How's my knee?
- Your knee is
going to be fine.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.254
- Great.
- Yep.
You'll be out of here soon,

08:08.288 --> 08:12.058
which should
disappoint a few nurses.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.195
- So, can I go home tomorrow?
- Well, not that soon.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.162
You tore some cartilage,

08:16.196 --> 08:19.299
and the only way to fix it
is with surgery.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.067
Surgery?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.802
You mean you're going
to cut me open?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.472
It's just a small incision
right behind the knee here.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.374
A few weeks, you'll be fine.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.310
Hey, it might even
improve your jumpshot.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.148
- Now get some rest, okay?
- All right.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.822
( scoffs ) Rest?
How can I rest?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.125
They're going to hack Zack.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.634
Hi, Screech.
More coffee, Mr. B?

08:54.668 --> 08:55.635
Oh, thank goodness.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.071
Kelly, what do you know
about advanced algebra?

08:58.104 --> 09:01.007
I know enough
not to take the course.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.909
Boy, am I glad
you guys are here.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.545
Guys, Lisa has some
big news about Zack.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.648
My mom says she'll have
to operate on his knee.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.084
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.288
This is not my fault!

09:15.321 --> 09:17.724
Tell it to the judge.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.159
Belding:
This is awful.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.562
I am going to go visit Zack.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.531
We all chipped in
and bought you this.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.600
It's an electronic black book,
for all those
nurses' phone numbers.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.535
All right.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.937
We want you to know
that we love you, okay?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.873
Yeah, and we hope
you don't die.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.143
Screech, come on.
It's just knee surgery.
I'm not that worried.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.146
Besides, this happens to be
the best
hospital in Los Angeles.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.048
That's what my
Uncle Morrie said.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.750
He got his
tonsils out here once,

09:43.783 --> 09:47.320
and he liked it so much
he stayed until his funeral.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.689
An operation is not
the end of the world.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.692
Everybody has to go through it
sometime, right?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.295
But why did it have
to happen to Zack?

09:55.328 --> 09:57.230
Kelly, come on.
I'll be fine.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.165
I just want you to be okay.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.102
Ahh, we need some cheering up.
Let's watch some TV.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.671
Oh no. Screech that's the...
( Zack yells )

10:04.704 --> 10:06.239
My leg!

10:08.208 --> 10:11.011
You pushed the wrong button.
This button controls the TV.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.979
( Zack shouts )

10:15.115 --> 10:18.318
Please!
Would you stop helping?
You're going to kill me.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.854
Yeah, why don't we leave
and let Zack rest?

10:20.887 --> 10:23.656
Oh, that's a good idea.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

10:23.690 --> 10:24.824
Take it easy, guy.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.127
I know you'll be all right...
I hope.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.828
( Zack sighs )

10:30.063 --> 10:32.932
( tearfully ) Goodbye, Zack.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.135
Here's my lucky frog's foot.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.739
If anything happens to you,
I'll get it back
from the morgue.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.242
Oh, will you get out of here,
you dork?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.679
Zack, you've got
nothing to fear.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.747
My mom is great
with the knife.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.015
Bye.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.256
Yeah, I have nothing
to worry about, right?

10:56.289 --> 10:59.359
( sighs )
All I need is
a good night's sleep.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.931
( harp playing )

11:11.204 --> 11:14.074
Hey, Screech.
What are you doing here?

11:14.074 --> 11:17.610
I'm not Screech.
I'm your
guardian angel Skippy.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.579
But you look
just like my friend Screech.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.916
Up there we all
look like this.
Soon you'll look like me too.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.852
Aw, you're kidding...
right?

11:25.885 --> 11:29.122
No. Now let's hit
that big highway to the sky.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.091
- Where are we going?
- To Heaven.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.127
Since there are two of us,
we can take the carpool lane.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.097
First, I have to sprinkle you
with this
heavenly "dork dust."

11:37.097 --> 11:39.132
( chimes ring )

11:39.833 --> 11:41.301
Wait a minute.

11:41.334 --> 11:45.171
Hey, can't I at least see
my friends one last time?

11:45.205 --> 11:48.708
Well, okay, but I'm not
making any toilet stops.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.912
( organ playing )

11:55.115 --> 11:58.284
( humming funeral march )

12:01.855 --> 12:05.625
- Hey, what's going on?
- It's
a ceremony in your honor.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.627
Hey, guys! I'm here.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.963
- ( crying )
- Hey, guys.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.664
Mr. Belding?

12:13.199 --> 12:16.136
Jeez, can't anybody hear me?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.805
You can't talk to them, Zack.
You can only listen.

12:18.838 --> 12:22.575
See, you're dead... extinct...
gone...
pfft, nap-oo. You get it?

12:22.609 --> 12:26.913
Now play by the rules,
or I'll make you look
like that Belding guy.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.649
It's so sad
now that Zack's gone.

12:29.683 --> 12:30.950
He was a great friend,

12:30.984 --> 12:33.253
and the only guy
I ever let climb in my window.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.889
I always had
a secret crush on Zack.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.758
If only I could've
kissed him just once.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.628
Well, hey. I'm here.
I'm here, kiss me.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.264
Hey, uh, uh, uh!
No kissing the living.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.734
( crying )

12:51.971 --> 12:54.107
Nerd #1:
We'll miss you, Zack.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.776
You were one cool dude
for a non-nerd.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.914
Nerd #2:
I'll never forget him.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.283
He gave the best noogies.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.157
( tearfully )
Z-A-C-K,

13:11.191 --> 13:13.059
since he's gone
the sky turned gray.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.195
He hurt his knee,
went under the knife,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.163
who'd have thought
he'd lose his life?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.632
Yay. Rah.
( sobbing )

13:25.939 --> 13:30.210
Well, Zack...
now that you're gone
we're retiring your jersey.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.780
No one will ever wear
your number again at Bayside.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.782
See you around, pal.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.087
( crowd bawling )

13:43.390 --> 13:45.191
It is now time...

13:45.225 --> 13:47.660
to dedicate this locker...

13:47.694 --> 13:49.629
to Zack's memory.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.667
And to lock it up
one last time.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.370
( wailing )

13:57.404 --> 14:00.640
Stop! Halt!
And quit it, even.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.045
- Who's that?
- That's Screech,
my best friend.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.581
- Known him my whole life.
- Pretty handsome dude.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.617
I won't let you
close Zack's locker.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.686
Not without me inside.
I'm going with him.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.754
No, no, Screech, little buddy.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.123
- You can't go in there.
- ( Screech whimpers )

14:17.157 --> 14:20.060
Where he's gone,
you can't follow.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.763
Shows what
that big doofus knows.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.565
( all keening )

14:34.240 --> 14:35.909
No!

14:38.778 --> 14:41.081
That's it.
No surgery for this guy.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.716
I'm outta here.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.890
( groaning )

14:51.858 --> 14:53.727
Ah, good evening, Doctor.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.763
( deep voice )
Good evening, nurse.
Sorry, no time for chit-chat.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.432
- But Doctor...
- No, no, no.
I'm off to surgery.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.769
I have to go
remove someone's...
uh... neck.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.305
Yes, it's a "nectaroctomy."

15:05.705 --> 15:07.674
- Wait!
- Yes?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.376
What do I do?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.945
The patient in room 312
is having chills.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.814
Uh, put him next to a guy
with a fever.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.690
( clears throat )
Good evening. Yes, yes, yes.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.059
Woman: You weren't
leaving me, were you?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.694
Uh oh.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.065
( seductively )
Not without saying goodbye.

15:32.065 --> 15:36.569
( nervously laughing )
Uh, no.
Of course not, goodbye!

15:36.603 --> 15:39.706
Doctor,
heal me with your kisses.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.609
( rapid smooches )

15:46.680 --> 15:49.382
Aw, man.
That is one sick lady.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.351
Doctor, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

15:51.384 --> 15:53.420
( clears throat )
Yeesss!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.622
Take me to the elevator.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.758
Carry on, nurses!

16:07.334 --> 16:10.303
Zack, you're supposed
to be in bed.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.771
What are you doing?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.841
Would you believe,
going for a midnight roll?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.617
My mother told me
you tried to run away.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.354
Are you crazy?
You could've hurt yourself.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.322
Boy, you sound
just like your mother.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.757
I do?

16:30.790 --> 16:33.393
Well, good,
you deserve it.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.528
Now, why were you
trying to leave?

16:35.562 --> 16:38.765
Look, Lisa, I really
don't feel like talking
about it, okay?

16:38.798 --> 16:41.668
Zack, my job here is
to try and help people.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.436
Now let me help you.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.073
I don't know...

16:47.974 --> 16:51.845
I guess I'm afraid
to have this operation.

16:51.878 --> 16:55.348
I understand.
I mean,
nobody likes being here.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.818
But you were in
a hospital before.
We both were, remember?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.553
How could I forget?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.522
We were nine
and went ice skating
for the first time.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.492
Yeah, we pretended to be
Olympic figure skaters.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.061
We were doing
pretty good till Screech
tripped and you fell over him.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.031
Then I grabbed onto you
to break my fall.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.766
When you did that
you ripped off my skirt.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.934
Then I fell and bumped
my butt on the ice.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.403
( both laughing )

17:16.435 --> 17:17.904
And I twisted my ankle.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.906
That was exciting, huh?

17:19.939 --> 17:21.907
Remember, they raced us
to the hospital
in the ambulance,

17:21.941 --> 17:24.477
and wheeled us
through emergency
like we were a big deal.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.780
And everything
turned out fine.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.049
I know, but Lisa,
that was different.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.484
- We were...
- Together?

17:31.518 --> 17:32.786
Yeah.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.422
Well, hey,
we're together now.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.558
But Lisa, what if something
goes wrong in the
operating room? What if...

17:38.591 --> 17:41.761
Honey,
you have got the best surgeon
in LA working on you.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.963
( laughs )
You're right.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.399
I'll be okay.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.967
Thanks for helping, Lisa.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.470
I really appreciate it.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.539
- That's my job.
- ( yawns )

17:53.940 --> 17:56.076
Looks like your medicine
is starting to kick in.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.577
Better get some sleep.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.879
Yeah, okay, Lise.

18:00.714 --> 18:03.049
- Just rest, Zack.
- Okay.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.297
Please, God,

18:17.330 --> 18:19.399
take care of my friend.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.645
Oh, good morning, Zack.

18:32.679 --> 18:37.617
Well, as Lisa would say,
"Am I a 10 or what?"

18:37.650 --> 18:40.854
I have to admit, the gown
looks better on you
than it did on me.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.923
Thank you.
Green is my color.

18:43.957 --> 18:47.327
Now,
Zack, the surgery will last
about two hours.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.530
You won't feel a thing
of course, because
you will be zonked out.

18:50.563 --> 18:54.334
I'll just pretend I'm sleeping
through Mr.
Dewey's math class.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.936
- I have great
dreams in there.
- Good, good.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.471
But, if you should
happen to wake up,

18:58.505 --> 19:04.678
( German accent ) I'll just
clobber you over the head
with my trusty mallet.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.047
- Are my parents here?
- Yeah,
they're in the waiting room.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.349
You'll see them after surgery.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.685
Okay, let's go fix that knee.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.763
Well, am I a 10 or what?

19:25.065 --> 19:27.834
Lisa? You're up
at 6:00 in the morning?

19:27.867 --> 19:31.471
Look, Mom, Zack is my patient,
and I want to be with him.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.040
Thanks, Lisa.
I'd really like that.

19:34.074 --> 19:37.344
You know, Mom,
I'm not just here to have fun,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.045
I have responsibilities.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.548
Well, that's my girl.
Give me a kiss.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.784
What, and smear my make-up?
Pshaw, get real.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.354
Now that's really my girl.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.055
Well, time to go.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.691
( in unison )
Let's rock and roll.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.566
Jessie, your turn
to sign the cast.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.836
Sure. I'll sign under your
picture of a dollhouse
and smiley kitten

20:02.869 --> 20:05.705
saying, "Come home soon."

20:05.739 --> 20:09.976
Zack, is there anything
I can do for you after
I punch Jessie out?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.546
Well,
my neck is a little sore.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.416
Four student nurses walked by
and I think I got whiplash.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.419
- Let me massage it for you.
- Okay.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.888
Mr. Belding, aren't you
going to sign my cast?

20:22.155 --> 20:24.758
Aw...

20:24.791 --> 20:27.827
And when you're done,
you can sign your
name to a big fat check

20:27.861 --> 20:30.563
to cover Zack's
medical expenses...

20:31.097 --> 20:33.366
Ow... ow.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.669
...and his pain and suffering.

20:37.771 --> 20:40.140
Don't move.

20:40.173 --> 20:44.577
Zack, I'm really glad
your surgery was a success.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.914
I wish I could say the same
about your math test.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.749
Mr. Dewey gave me a C-.

20:49.783 --> 20:52.719
Well, sir, I suggest you ask
Mr. Dewey for a make-up exam.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.721
And this time,
get the nerds to help.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.791
Please get better soon.
We really miss
you around school.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.393
I can't take
much more algebra.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.796
Here you go, Preppie.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.532
A little get-well gift
from the basketball team.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.435
- We want you to
keep practicing.
- Hey, excellent.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.404
It's also a good way
to get nurses. Watch.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.676
Oh, and here comes
my favorite nurse now.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.079
Nice shot, Zack.
How's your leg?

21:19.112 --> 21:22.615
As far as I know,
it's in there.
Did you sign my cast?

21:22.649 --> 21:26.686
Baby, I helped make that cast.
I lost a nail
wrapping your knee.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.122
- Thanks for everything, Lisa.
- No problem.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.391
All right, everybody,
it's been fun seeing you.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.093
Now get out,
Zack needs his rest.

21:33.126 --> 21:36.429
- ( everyone groans )
- She's tough, but she's good.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.832
We can't leave yet.
"Gilligan's Island" is on.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.500
All: Screech, No!

21:46.106 --> 21:48.875
( instrumental
theme music plays)
