01:32.625 --> 01:35.542
If you are interested in stories
with happy endings,

01:35.625 --> 01:38.125
then you would be better off
somewhere else.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.250
In this story,
not only is there no happy ending,

01:40.333 --> 01:43.667
there is no happy beginning,
and very few happy things in the middle.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.125
My name is Lemony Snicket.

01:45.208 --> 01:47.917
It is my solemn duty to bring to light
the sorry history

01:48.000 --> 01:51.042
of the Baudelaire children
as it happened so many years ago.

01:51.958 --> 01:54.500
But you in the audience
have no such obligation,

01:54.583 --> 01:57.875
and I would advise all our viewers
to turn away immediately

01:57.958 --> 02:00.125
and watch something more pleasant instead.

02:12.917 --> 02:16.292
This story will be dreadful,
melancholy and calamitous,

02:16.375 --> 02:19.375
a word which here means
"dreadful and melancholy."

02:20.375 --> 02:22.917
That is because not very many
happy things happened

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
in the lives of the Baudelaires.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.625
Violet, Klaus and Sunny were
intelligent children.

02:42.708 --> 02:46.917
Charming and resourceful,
they had pleasant facial features,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.292
but they were extremely unlucky.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.625
Most everything
that happened to them was rife

02:51.708 --> 02:54.292
with misfortune, misery and despair.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.375
I'm sorry to tell you this...

03:09.208 --> 03:11.250
but that's how the story goes.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.000
Briny Beach, please.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.792
The Baudelaire family
lived in an enormous mansion

03:17.875 --> 03:19.500
at the heart of a dirty and busy city,

03:19.583 --> 03:22.625
and one day the parents
rather unexpectedly asked their children

03:22.708 --> 03:25.583
to take a rickety trolley alone
to the seashore.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.875
I wonder why Mother and Father
didn't want to come with us.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.833
Maybe they don't like
this rickety trolley.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.708
"Rickety" is a word here which means

03:31.792 --> 03:34.708
"unsteady" or "likely to collapse
at any moment."

03:34.792 --> 03:37.458
Hey, kids! Aren't you going
to the Festive Fun Fair,

03:37.542 --> 03:39.625
with all the jolly rides
and games and snacks?

03:39.708 --> 03:40.917
"Festive" means "fun."

03:41.000 --> 03:42.458
We know what "festive" means.

03:42.542 --> 03:45.167
Thank you, but it's a perfect morning
to go to the beach.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.792
- It's gray and cloudy.
- That's what makes it perfect.

03:47.875 --> 03:48.917
Suit yourself.

03:51.083 --> 03:54.583
When Briny Beach was hot and sunny,
the seashore was crowded with tourists

03:54.667 --> 03:57.625
and it was impossible to find
a good place to lay one's blanket.

03:59.208 --> 04:02.917
On gray and cloudy days, the Baudelaires
had the beach more or less to themselves,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.417
so they could work together
on their projects and experiments.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.458
- Are you ready?
- Let's get to work.

04:08.542 --> 04:10.292
Do you think this will be as good
as the mailbox?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.458
I think this will be even better
than the mailbox.

04:12.542 --> 04:15.125
<i>Violet Baudelaire
was the eldest Baudelaire child.</i>

04:15.208 --> 04:17.333
<i>She was 14 years old, right-handed,</i>

04:17.416 --> 04:20.833
<i>had a real knack for inventing
and building unusual devices.</i>

04:20.916 --> 04:23.167
I'm having a problem
with the grandfather clock.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.417
Can you show me
what the specific issues are?

04:29.292 --> 04:30.417
See? It toasts the bread,

04:30.500 --> 04:32.792
but the minute hand
falls behind five minutes.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.917
It could be a problem with the gears.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.375
That'd be disappointing.
I made them myself.

04:38.042 --> 04:40.833
When Violet Baudelaire
tied her hair up like that,

04:40.917 --> 04:44.500
it was a sure sign that the pulleys,
levers and gears of her inventing mind

04:44.583 --> 04:46.125
were working at top speed.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.667
Klaus, at what angle
are the prevailing currents?

04:48.750 --> 04:50.167
The angle of the prevailing currents...

04:50.250 --> 04:53.375
Klaus Baudelaire was the middle child
and only boy.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.583
He was a little older than 12
and wore glasses,

04:55.667 --> 04:57.000
which made him look intelligent.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.792
Of course, we still need
the right projectile.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.250
He was intelligent.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.958
Violet, I'm not sure
I understand this passage of Proust.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.333
Could you read it to me?

05:09.417 --> 05:11.792
"Happiness is beneficial for the body,

05:11.875 --> 05:14.417
but it is grief that develops
the powers of the mind."

05:14.500 --> 05:15.917
It could be the translation.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.333
Maybe it makes more sense
in the original French.

05:21.208 --> 05:23.000
Sunny, do we have the right projectile?

05:23.083 --> 05:25.583
Sunny Baudelaire was an infant,

05:25.667 --> 05:27.542
a word which here means
"a person of the age

05:27.625 --> 05:30.375
at which one mostly speaks in a series
of unintelligible shrieks,"

05:30.458 --> 05:32.917
so most people had trouble understanding
what she was saying.

05:33.111 --> 05:35.111
Can you find a rock
that's not sandstone?

05:37.667 --> 05:40.208
What Sunny lacked
in communication skills, however,

05:40.292 --> 05:44.083
she made up for with the size
and sharpness of her four teeth.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.083
That's perfect, Sunny. Thank you.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.667
Excuse me, Violet,
but why are you using your left hand?

06:08.750 --> 06:10.375
I'm curious to see if I can skip the rock

06:10.458 --> 06:11.958
as far with my left
as I can with my right.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.208
I don't mean to criticize,

06:13.292 --> 06:15.958
but standard scientific method
calls for stable systematics.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.667
You should use your standard
right-handedness.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.250
That does seem reasonable.

06:20.401 --> 06:22.401
I agree.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.292
Klaus, what's that thing Einstein said?

06:32.375 --> 06:35.250
"The most beautiful thing
we can experience is the mysterious.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.750
It is the source
of all true art and science."

06:37.833 --> 06:39.792
And what's that thing James Brown said?

06:39.875 --> 06:41.833
"I got something
that makes me want to shout."

06:41.917 --> 06:44.625
"I've got something that tells me
what it's all about."

07:04.917 --> 07:06.708
"I'm super bad!"

07:06.792 --> 07:08.000
It worked.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.542
I never expected otherwise.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.375
Yes, the invention worked.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.333
This would be a perfect time to leave

07:15.417 --> 07:18.625
and pretend the rest of the story
was just as happy and successful.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.333
I just wish Mother and Father had seen it.

07:20.417 --> 07:23.125
It's not like them to send us off
on our own so unexpectedly.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.870
Who's that mysterious figure?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.708
Certainly, I wish I could go back

07:36.792 --> 07:39.375
and change the history of the Baudelaires
at this very moment

07:39.458 --> 07:42.958
rather than the descent
into misery, tribulation and...

07:43.875 --> 07:47.583
dire inconvenience
which will occur shortly.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.750
It only seems scary
because of all the mist.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.125
It's Mr. Poe.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.708
From the bank? What's he doing here?

08:13.958 --> 08:15.458
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

08:15.830 --> 08:16.808
- How do you do?

08:16.958 --> 08:18.667
Fine, thank you.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.042
It's a nice day.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.042
It is a nice day.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.625
I have some very bad news
for you children.

08:26.708 --> 08:29.875
Your parents have perished
in a terrible fire.

08:34.792 --> 08:38.292
They perished in a fire
that destroyed your entire home.

08:41.417 --> 08:45.667
I'm very, very sorry
to have to tell you this...

08:46.417 --> 08:47.750
my dears.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.792
"Perished" means "killed."

08:53.875 --> 08:55.750
We know what "perished" means.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.208
Hey.

09:07.375 --> 09:10.833
I have spent months of research
and years crying myself to sleep,

09:10.917 --> 09:14.500
trying to discover the precise cause
of the Baudelaire fire.

09:29.208 --> 09:33.125
But... all my associates
and I have managed to learn

09:33.208 --> 09:35.792
is that neither
the official fire department

09:35.875 --> 09:40.125
nor the volunteer fire department
arrived in time to stop the blaze.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.625
And within moments,
the entire Baudelaire mansion

09:42.708 --> 09:44.167
was engulfed in flames.

09:45.083 --> 09:48.875
It is useless for me to describe to you
how terrible Violet, Klaus and Sunny felt

09:48.958 --> 09:50.583
in the time that followed.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.792
If you have ever lost somebody
very important to you,

09:52.875 --> 09:54.333
then you already know how it feels.

09:54.417 --> 09:58.083
And if you haven't...
you cannot possibly imagine it.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.833
I've never been through
anything like this myself,

10:19.917 --> 10:21.833
but I can imagine just how you feel.

10:22.667 --> 10:26.042
I did think you'd want to see
what remains of your home,

10:26.125 --> 10:29.208
- even though it is...
- more or less, um...

10:29.292 --> 10:31.042
It's all gone.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.292
I just want to assure you Baudelaires
that you have absolutely nothing...

10:36.375 --> 10:37.917
We have absolutely nothing.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.375
...to worry about.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.620
What's that?

10:50.208 --> 10:52.750
I am the executor of your parents' estate,

10:52.833 --> 10:57.083
which means I'll be handling all matters
concerning everything they left behind.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.583
What did they leave behind?

10:58.667 --> 11:00.958
Financial security.

11:03.875 --> 11:08.083
Your parents left behind
an enormous fortune,

11:08.167 --> 11:10.167
which will be yours
when Violet comes of age.

11:10.250 --> 11:14.625
Until then, you will be placed
with the proper guardian, or guardians,

11:14.708 --> 11:18.875
as decided by myself and my fellow bankers
at Mulctuary Money Management.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.250
Say goodbye, Baudelaires.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.708
Goodbye.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.792
Until we've identified
your designated guardian,

12:09.875 --> 12:11.542
you'll stay with my family.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.542
That's not so bad, is it, Baudelaires?

12:13.625 --> 12:16.042
I'm sure you'll become fast friends
with Edgar and Albert.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.375
<i>- It's a raven.</i>
<i>- It's a crow!</i>

12:20.458 --> 12:22.250
- It's a raven!
- It's a crow!

12:22.333 --> 12:23.708
It's chicken. Boiled chicken.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.458
And we have boiled potatoes
and blanched string beans.

12:26.542 --> 12:27.750
What does "blanched" mean?

12:27.833 --> 12:29.667
- It means "boiled."
- Nobody asked you.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.167
Now, now, son.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.958
No, my darling, Albert is right.
Nobody asked the Baudelaires.

12:35.042 --> 12:36.458
But, honey, look!

12:36.542 --> 12:39.125
Dearest, maybe not
in front of the children.

12:39.208 --> 12:41.667
But I thought it would cheer them up,
the little Gloomy Guses.

12:41.750 --> 12:45.125
I had my star reporter write an article
for the front page

12:45.208 --> 12:46.708
so that everyone will know

12:46.792 --> 12:49.208
your home was destroyed
and you're orphans now.

12:49.292 --> 12:50.708
The front page!

12:50.792 --> 12:52.708
Some people wait a lifetime for that.

12:52.792 --> 12:56.458
And darling, look...
you're mentioned, too!

13:01.583 --> 13:06.167
"Generosity shown by prominent member
of the banking community."

13:06.250 --> 13:08.458
If your bosses at the bank see this,
it may spell

13:08.542 --> 13:11.750
P-R-O-M-A-T-I-O-N!

13:11.833 --> 13:13.333
- Promation?
- Promotion!

13:13.417 --> 13:15.500
- No, that's not how you spell "promotion."
- Promotion.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.958
- P-R-O... P-R-R...
- P-R-O-M-A-E-O...

13:18.042 --> 13:19.833
- See? I've been saying it...
- Honey, P-R-R...

13:19.917 --> 13:21.000
Listen to what I'm saying...

13:21.083 --> 13:22.667
- I'm sorry.
- before you start speaking!

13:22.750 --> 13:25.000
P-R-O...
- I don't... feel very hungry.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.500
May we go to our rooms?

13:28.583 --> 13:31.375
"Rooms"?

13:32.583 --> 13:35.625
- Good night, Edgar.
- Good night, Albert.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.750
- Good night, Albert.
- Good night, Edgar.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.250
And good night, guests.

13:44.458 --> 13:48.375
You must feel terrible,
and you must miss your parents very much.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.250
We do.

13:50.333 --> 13:51.417
You do what?

13:52.333 --> 13:53.333
Say it.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.750
We feel terrible,
and we miss our parents very much.

13:59.125 --> 14:02.375
That's gonna make a wonderful headline.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.917
Good night, Baudelaires.
Remember, our home is your home.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.375
But don't touch anything.

14:20.833 --> 14:21.833
How'd you do it?

14:26.167 --> 14:27.333
Do what?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.500
Set the fire.

14:40.542 --> 14:44.708
<i>In the years since, I've inquired
what became of the Brothers Poe.</i>

14:44.792 --> 14:47.333
<i>One followed his father
into the world of banking.</i>

14:47.417 --> 14:49.875
<i>The other lives in a cave
and talks to sheep.</i>

14:50.917 --> 14:52.833
They each think the other has it better.

14:53.875 --> 14:59.167
I regret to inform you,
the Baudelaires' fate was worse.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.284
<i>"We feel terrible
and we miss our parents very much"</i>

15:14.625 --> 15:15.917
Chop-chop, Baudelaires!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.917
Now that I've found you
a suitable guardian,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.292
I'm going to take you to your new home
before banking hours begin.

15:25.605 --> 15:27.605
<i>"We feel terrible
and we miss our parents very much"</i>

15:30.250 --> 15:32.958
I know you must be nervous
about living with a guardian.

15:33.042 --> 15:35.333
I remember how I was when I was your age.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.667
We're all different ages.

15:36.750 --> 15:39.083
Well, I should think
at least a fraction of your unhappiness

15:39.167 --> 15:41.458
will turn to excitement
when you meet this man.

15:41.542 --> 15:43.917
I know he's certainly
very eager to meet you.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.500
And he's employed as an actor,
so you know his excitement is genuine.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.375
His name is Count Olaf.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.917
- Never heard of him.
- He's either... Let's see. What is it?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.875
Your third cousin fourth time removed,
or your fourth cousin three times removed.

15:56.958 --> 15:58.250
In any case, he's removed.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.750
Still, he's only three miles away,
and your parents' will was very specific

16:01.833 --> 16:04.000
about your being raised
by your closest living relative.

16:04.083 --> 16:07.083
Does he really think that's
what "closest living relative" means?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.333
- Mr. Poe?
- Hmm?

16:08.417 --> 16:09.875
If he lives so close by,

16:09.958 --> 16:11.875
why didn't our parents
ever invite him over?

16:11.958 --> 16:13.917
Possibly because he was very busy.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.292
As a banker,
I'm often very busy myself.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.417
Which is why this guardian drop-off
is going to be a bit hasty.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.625
"Hasty" means "quickly,"
because I'm due at the bank soon.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.792
We know what "hasty" means.

16:31.708 --> 16:35.375
Hello there! Salutations! Shalom!

16:35.458 --> 16:38.333
You must be the Baudelaire children!

16:38.417 --> 16:39.917
Yes, I'm Violet Baudelaire,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.292
and this is my brother, Klaus,
and this is my sister, Sunny.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.083
And this is Mr. Poe.
He's been arranging things for us.

16:45.167 --> 16:48.333
Mulctuary Money Management.
My name and title are on the card.

16:48.417 --> 16:51.875
Although I may be in line for a promotion,
so that might change.

16:51.958 --> 16:54.458
Oh, well, I am Justice Strauss
of the High Court.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.500
Forgive my not shaking hands,
but as you can see,

16:56.583 --> 16:58.042
I am a mountain of parcels.

16:58.125 --> 17:01.167
I just bought a new toolkit
because my food processor broke.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.042
Although I don't know
who I think I'm kidding,

17:03.125 --> 17:06.625
because I have no inventive
or mechanical skill whatsoever.

17:06.708 --> 17:10.541
Then I treated myself to new file cards
for my private library,

17:10.625 --> 17:13.291
and frankly I don't have
an acute literary sense.

17:13.375 --> 17:18.250
And then, to top it all off,
I forgot to buy a new bread knife.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.750
It means I have no possible way
of cutting up this baguette

17:20.833 --> 17:22.291
into bite-sized pieces,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.166
which is really unfortunate

17:24.250 --> 17:26.958
because I was gonna take the bread
that was cut up

17:27.041 --> 17:28.792
with a white bean hummus...

17:28.875 --> 17:31.417
We'd be more than happy
to be of assistance, Justice Strauss.

17:31.500 --> 17:36.500
My sister is very mechanically minded,
and I'm quite adept at library science.

17:37.048 --> 17:39.048
I'd also be happy to help.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.292
What my sister means is
her teeth are perfect for slicing bread.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.417
Well, how wonderful!

17:45.500 --> 17:49.792
How lucky am I to have
such unusual children in my life?

17:49.875 --> 17:51.167
Are you Count Olaf's wife?

17:51.250 --> 17:52.375
What?

17:52.458 --> 17:54.542
Oh! Oh, no!

17:54.625 --> 17:57.083
No. No. Goodness me, no.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.458
No, I don't even really know him
that well.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.292
He's... he's just my neighbor.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.833
His house is over there.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.125
That's strange.

18:31.833 --> 18:35.333
He said specifically he was waiting
very eagerly to get his hands on you.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.500
Oh.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.792
Hello. No.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.375
Hello.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.917
Hello, hello, hello.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.250
Hello. Hello.

19:03.875 --> 19:07.500
Hello, hello, hello, children.

19:14.167 --> 19:20.583
I am Count Olaf,
the renowned actor and your new guardian.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.708
You're welcome.

19:25.833 --> 19:26.875
Thank you.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.292
You're welcome.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.500
Please, come in,
and mind you wipe your feet on the mat

19:31.583 --> 19:33.000
so you don't track in any mud.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.417
And don't forget your enormous fortune!

19:41.750 --> 19:45.042
Welcome to my humble home, orphans.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.000
And...

19:48.250 --> 19:50.875
- a man with a hat on.
- Poe.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.417
Actually, I'm about to be rather wealthy.
So if you'll excuse me...

19:53.500 --> 19:56.833
No, we spoke on the phone.
I'm from Mulctuary Money Management.

19:56.917 --> 19:59.167
Hmm. "Money" sounds familiar, but...

19:59.250 --> 20:00.708
The bank. I'm from the bank.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.708
Ah, yes, the bank.

20:02.792 --> 20:05.458
Well, welcome to my humble home.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.583
It does seem to need
a little work.

20:14.042 --> 20:18.375
Well, I realize it's not as fancy
as the Baudelaire mansion,

20:18.458 --> 20:20.667
but perhaps, children,
with a bit of your money,

20:20.750 --> 20:23.125
we'll be able to fix it up, make it nicer.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.833
Count Olaf, the Baudelaire fortune
is not to be used for such matters.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.958
The Baudelaire will is very specific
as to how the children are to be raised

20:29.042 --> 20:30.500
in case of an unfortunate event.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.542
Ah, yes, the fire.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.208
They're to be raised
by their closest relative.

20:34.292 --> 20:35.333
That is I, Count Olaf.

20:35.417 --> 20:39.250
And every cent of the Baudelaire fortune
is locked up until Violet comes of age.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.583
- Which one is Violet?
- The eldest.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.042
All right, then.

20:47.125 --> 20:51.208
Well, I hope I can prove myself
to be the father you never had.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.333
We had a father.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.958
Yes, I know. And a mother.

20:55.042 --> 20:57.083
Remarkable woman. Flammable.

20:58.708 --> 21:01.708
So, Poe, do I need to sign for them
or something?

21:01.792 --> 21:03.333
What? No. No.

21:03.417 --> 21:08.375
Well, then, as we say in the theater,
exit stage right.

21:08.458 --> 21:11.292
Goodbye, Violet. Goodbye, Klaus.
Goodbye, Sunny.

21:11.375 --> 21:14.208
I hope you'll be happy here.
I'll still check in on you occasionally.

21:14.292 --> 21:17.250
If you need anything or have questions,
you can reach me at the bank.

21:24.625 --> 21:28.042
Well, children, before I give you a tour
of your new home,

21:28.125 --> 21:30.458
aren't you going to say
"How do you do?"

21:30.542 --> 21:32.167
to your new guardian?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.042
How do you do?

21:36.292 --> 21:37.833
How do I do?

21:40.417 --> 21:44.917
Better and better, Baudelaires.

21:45.833 --> 21:49.417
Better and better.

21:50.875 --> 21:53.125
The dreadful villainy of this vile fiend

21:53.208 --> 21:56.750
has haunted me
since I first met him as a young man.

21:56.833 --> 21:59.708
And every night when I continue my work
on the Baudelaire case,

21:59.792 --> 22:03.833
I find myself weeping
thinking of his utter wickedness

22:03.917 --> 22:06.667
and severe lack of theatrical talent.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.583
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a list.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.917
Wrong! It's a list. A list of chores.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Rich brats like you
are probably spoiled rotten

22:17.083 --> 22:18.792
and have never done a chore in your life.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.917
Actually, we often help around the house.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.167
Really? Did you help
around the house? That's great.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.667
Well, welcome to your lucky life.

22:25.750 --> 22:29.458
Come with me, and I'll show you
the delightful features of your home.

22:34.583 --> 22:38.000
This is the kitchen,
where you may help yourselves to meals.

22:38.083 --> 22:41.583
I expect you to keep everything
<i>gleamingly</i> clean.

22:41.667 --> 22:42.958
"Gleamingly"?

22:43.583 --> 22:45.292
Clean.

22:45.375 --> 22:47.250
The stove is a bit like a servant.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.208
You have to whack it sometimes...

22:49.292 --> 22:50.500
to get it to work.

22:54.542 --> 22:58.083
This is the library,
which you will keep <i>well-dusted</i>.

22:58.167 --> 22:59.833
This is where I do all my reading.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.042
I don't use the ballroom at all.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.875
You'll have to redo the floors.

23:13.042 --> 23:17.250
Laundry room. You can hang my underwear
on that rack when you're done washing it.

23:20.958 --> 23:24.083
This is the backyard,
which needs weeding, mowing and pruning.

23:24.167 --> 23:26.083
It is also where you will chop wood.

23:32.542 --> 23:35.833
Bathroom number seven,
the only one you are allowed to use.

23:35.917 --> 23:37.542
It has all the usual amenities,

23:37.625 --> 23:39.500
though the management
regrets to inform you

23:39.583 --> 23:41.583
that the shampoo is not tear-free.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.708
If anything, it encourages tears.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.625
Rats bite.

23:49.958 --> 23:52.875
And this is where you will sleep, orphans.

23:54.750 --> 23:58.083
Out of all the numerous bedrooms
in this enormous mansion,

23:58.167 --> 24:00.958
I have chose this one
for your safety and comfort.

24:01.042 --> 24:02.250
There's only one bed.

24:02.917 --> 24:06.292
As you can see,
I have provided, at no cost to you,

24:06.375 --> 24:08.917
this complimentary pile of rocks.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.042
Thoughts?

24:21.917 --> 24:23.792
Thoughts? First of all...

24:23.875 --> 24:27.125
First of all,
first impressions are often wrong.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.708
Very true.

24:28.792 --> 24:33.000
For example, your first impression of me
may be that I am a terrible person.

24:33.083 --> 24:37.583
But in time, Baudelaires,
I hope you'll come to realize...

24:40.333 --> 24:44.750
you haven't the faintest idea.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.208
I'll give you a moment to unpack.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.458
It's okay, Sunny, he's gone.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.458
He's horrible.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.375
Did you see the tattoo on his ankle?

25:04.458 --> 25:06.583
A tattoo is just a decorative pigment
on skin.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.792
It's not a sign of a wicked person.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.625
Unless it's on a wicked person.

25:12.292 --> 25:14.208
How could our parents put us here?

25:14.292 --> 25:17.042
It's just a mistake.
It'll get sorted out.

25:17.125 --> 25:20.833
Until then, we'll make this our home.

25:21.417 --> 25:23.875
Mother used to say,
"Home is where you hang your hat."

25:24.792 --> 25:26.333
But we don't have any hats.

25:27.167 --> 25:28.167
Just rocks.

25:28.708 --> 25:33.250
Klaus, have you read any books on people
who make homes in difficult places?

25:33.833 --> 25:35.500
There's a village in the Pacific Islands

25:35.583 --> 25:37.750
suspended on ropes
above an active volcano.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.000
How do they manage?

25:40.708 --> 25:43.458
They own very little in case it erupts.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.667
Then we're already one step ahead.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.083
We own nothing.

25:49.208 --> 25:52.667
If they can survive that,
we can survive Count Olaf.

25:56.542 --> 25:57.792
Showtime!

26:00.417 --> 26:05.125
Remember, if you work extra hard,
you get to go to the ball... room...

26:05.208 --> 26:06.792
which is even grimier.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.167
Hang on to your toothbrushes.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.042
You'll need them for your teeth.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.583
Stay here. And not a peep.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.500
You're a little old for a Girl Scout.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.292
I'm Justice Strauss.

26:25.958 --> 26:26.875
Doesn't ring a bell.

26:26.958 --> 26:29.500
I'm your neighbor.
I... I live across the street.

26:30.167 --> 26:31.667
You've done something different
to your hair.

26:31.750 --> 26:32.792
May I come in?

26:32.875 --> 26:33.958
Is this about the children?

26:34.042 --> 26:37.250
I apologize for the noise. I told them
to cry using their inside voices.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.542
- What?
- Hmm?

26:39.292 --> 26:42.042
I... I just thought I'd stop by
and see how they're doing.

26:42.125 --> 26:45.333
I know it's a little soon,
but I'm about to become very busy

26:45.417 --> 26:47.250
with a difficult case in High Court.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.208
I'm not supposed to talk about it,

26:49.292 --> 26:54.708
but I can tell you that it involved
an illegal use of someone's credit card...

26:54.792 --> 26:56.458
and a poisonous plant.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.167
I made them this lamb.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.542
How neighborly.

27:06.542 --> 27:09.125
I don't mean to seem like a lonely woman

27:09.208 --> 27:12.292
who's overinvested in the lives
of someone else's children...

27:12.375 --> 27:13.875
You do have that aura.

27:14.542 --> 27:16.792
Perhaps if I just pop in
for a quick "hello"...

27:16.875 --> 27:19.750
- Now is not a good time.
- They're in one of their moods.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.250
They seemed so sweet.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.833
Do you have children, Justice Strauss?

27:23.917 --> 27:25.167
Me?

27:25.250 --> 27:26.792
Oh, no. No.

27:26.875 --> 27:30.958
No, I always hoped I would,
but I'm married to the law,

27:31.042 --> 27:34.625
and you can't very well have
book babies...

27:35.625 --> 27:37.167
now, can you?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.000
Well, you dodged a bullet.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.833
Let me tell you,
those children are monsters.

27:43.417 --> 27:46.708
I open my home to them,
and all they do is complain.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.625
"The bathroom is filthy.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.708
The rat is noisy.
The bed is cramped."

27:51.792 --> 27:54.250
I think living in a mansion
has spoiled them.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.125
Well, they did just lose their...

27:56.208 --> 27:57.458
Did you say "bed"?

27:57.542 --> 28:01.083
I meant "bed" as in
"more than one bed," obviously.

28:01.167 --> 28:03.542
The plural of "bed" is... "bed."

28:03.625 --> 28:05.583
Well, I wouldn't know. I live alone.

28:05.667 --> 28:06.917
No kidding.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.917
At least give them the lamb.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.792
I made my own mint jelly and...

28:12.875 --> 28:16.208
Please, just ask them
if they'd like to see me.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.583
Fine.

28:19.667 --> 28:23.625
But wait here, for your own safety.
They tend to throw things.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.208
You missed a spot.

28:51.167 --> 28:52.125
Oh!

28:52.542 --> 28:53.958
They don't want to see you.

28:54.042 --> 28:55.833
Are you sure? What did they say?

28:55.917 --> 28:57.958
"The lamb was too salty."

28:58.042 --> 28:59.208
Rich kids.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.958
Oh... I see.

29:03.667 --> 29:06.750
If only Justice Strauss
had been able to get past Count Olaf,

29:06.833 --> 29:09.750
if only she'd seen the children
in their horrible circumstances,

29:09.833 --> 29:13.750
if only this world weren't
such a wicked and Topsy-turvy place...

29:14.500 --> 29:17.042
this story might have
turned out differently.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.750
I never wanna use a toothbrush again.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.833
Why aren't you cleaning?
My list was very specific.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.250
We finished it.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.083
No, you didn't.

29:40.333 --> 29:41.667
We even washed your underwear.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.333
You missed one.

29:44.417 --> 29:48.333
You still have to prepare a large meal
for myself and my theater troupe.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.667
We don't know how to prepare
a large dinner.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.958
Plan the menu,
purchase the ingredients,

29:54.042 --> 29:58.167
prepare the food, set the table,
serve dinner, clean up afterward,

29:58.250 --> 29:59.667
and stay out of our way.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.750
How can we purchase anything?
We don't have any money.

30:06.917 --> 30:07.917
Do you know what that is?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.292
- Something greasy.
- Money.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.500
Hard-earned money.

30:12.583 --> 30:17.083
The most important substance on earth
besides applause and lip balm.

30:17.167 --> 30:21.167
Since the bossy banker won't let us use
any of your parents' enormous fortune,

30:21.250 --> 30:24.917
I am now forced
to cough up my own earnings

30:25.000 --> 30:28.292
from theatrical performances
and the occasional bit of consulting work.

30:28.375 --> 30:31.083
Now... quick. Get a move on.

30:31.167 --> 30:32.667
The troupe will be here at 7:00.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.708
And in the meantime, I will be up in...

30:35.417 --> 30:36.250
Can you guess?

30:36.333 --> 30:37.583
Your secret tower room?

30:37.667 --> 30:40.542
Wrong! My secret tower room.

30:40.625 --> 30:43.708
Which you are forbidden to go into.
Understood? Forbidden!

30:43.792 --> 30:46.125
- Forbidden.
- That's... Yes.

30:48.332 --> 30:50.332
That was dismaying.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.333
How are we supposed to make dinner
for an entire theater troupe?

30:56.833 --> 30:58.167
We start with a recipe.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.708
Do you think Justice Strauss' library
has any cookbooks?

31:02.761 --> 31:04.761
<i>"Baudelaires safe and sound
at home of famous actor"</i>

31:17.458 --> 31:21.000
Baudelaires.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.167
We meant to come sooner.
We've been cleaning.

31:23.250 --> 31:26.375
Yes, Count Olaf told me
you were very particular about that.

31:26.458 --> 31:28.875
I hope you appreciate
how much he's doing for you.

31:28.958 --> 31:31.625
I wouldn't say "much."

31:31.708 --> 31:35.167
Well, perhaps not compared
to what you're used to.

31:35.250 --> 31:36.542
What can I do for you?

31:36.625 --> 31:39.125
Actually, Justice Strauss,
we really need your help.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.250
You do?

31:40.875 --> 31:42.625
My sisters and I were wondering...

31:43.542 --> 31:45.250
Wondering what?

31:45.333 --> 31:47.208
If we might use your library.

31:47.292 --> 31:50.042
If you might use my library.

31:52.667 --> 31:55.500
Is there any book
you're looking for in particular?

31:56.083 --> 31:58.333
A cookbook, so we can make dinner.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.417
I suppose anything but lamb.

32:00.500 --> 32:04.500
Well, my private library is open to you
whenever you'd like.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.500
It's mostly law books,
but there are sections on everything

32:07.583 --> 32:11.500
from Italian cuisine
to the world's most threatening fungus.

32:20.042 --> 32:24.708
I suppose it's not as nice
as the libraries you're used to, but...

32:24.792 --> 32:26.542
- It's marvelous.
- It's wonderful.

32:26.525 --> 32:28.050
Do you really think so?

32:27.990 --> 32:29.490
Magnificent!

32:28.333 --> 32:30.458
That means she likes it.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.542
Well, I'm so glad.

32:32.625 --> 32:36.083
The cookbooks are over there in Section G,

32:36.167 --> 32:40.167
and right here is my favorite table
for serious research.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.583
Do you have a paper and pencil
to take notes?

32:43.667 --> 32:44.917
Always.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.833
- What's that?
- It’s something my parents had.

32:47.917 --> 32:49.583
- What is it?
- I don't know.

32:51.625 --> 32:52.667
Hmm.

32:56.125 --> 33:00.583
Something, Klaus Baudelaire,
is ringing a very faint bell.

33:00.667 --> 33:06.083
A library is like an island
in a vast sea of ignorance.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.250
Don't you agree?

33:07.333 --> 33:12.167
I do. Particularly if the library is tall
and the surrounded area has been flooded.

33:12.250 --> 33:13.583
That's a very good point.

33:13.667 --> 33:15.000
These books look promising.

33:15.083 --> 33:18.542
Klaus, help your sister.
Let me see what I can find here.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.667
I think I found something.
Pasta puttanesca.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.250
I wonder what that means in Italian.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.667
All we have to do is saute
garlics and onions in a pot,

33:25.750 --> 33:29.583
and then add olives, capers, anchovies,
diced parsley and tomatoes to simmer.

33:29.667 --> 33:30.833
We still need the pasta.

33:31.750 --> 33:34.208
I saw a pasta machine
in Count Olaf's kitchen.

33:34.292 --> 33:36.792
- Looked broken, but I think I can fix it.
- What do we have here?

33:36.875 --> 33:37.875
Justice Strauss?

33:37.958 --> 33:40.000
- Yes?
- Is there a supermarket nearby?

33:40.083 --> 33:42.667
Oh... no.

33:42.750 --> 33:47.542
But there is a local open-air market
and gin distillery.

33:53.542 --> 33:55.292
Thanks again for taking us.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.208
I don't know
what we would have done without you.

33:57.292 --> 33:59.000
Oh, you're resourceful children.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.375
I daresay you would have thought
of something.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.042
I think it's nice
that you're cooking dinner

34:04.125 --> 34:07.208
for Count Olaf
and your new theatrical family.

34:07.292 --> 34:10.167
I had dreams
of becoming an actress, you know.

34:10.250 --> 34:13.417
An actress and a mother,
instead of ending up

34:13.500 --> 34:16.208
as a world-renowned member
of the judiciary...

34:16.292 --> 34:20.875
and in a series of strained,
platonic relationships.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.167
Baudelaires?

34:33.875 --> 34:37.750
I always find cooking for family
to be something of a mitzvah.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.000
Do you know what that means?

34:39.083 --> 34:40.583
- Commandment?
- Blessing.

34:41.625 --> 34:44.917
You children have had such sorrow
in your lives already,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.667
you deserve the blessing
of a new family with Count Olaf,

34:49.750 --> 34:52.417
and, if you don't mind my saying so...

34:53.625 --> 34:54.458
with me.

34:54.542 --> 34:57.542
We don't mind your saying so.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.875
Klaus, what's that thing James Brown said?

35:16.583 --> 35:17.750
"I feel good."

35:17.833 --> 35:20.208
And a one, and a two, and a...

35:21.458 --> 35:24.250
<i> It's the count, it's the count
It's the count </i>

35:24.333 --> 35:27.833
<i># It's the count, it's the count
It's the count #</i>

35:27.917 --> 35:31.083
<i># Who else has such robust good looks
In such a large amount? #</i>

35:31.167 --> 35:35.750
<i># I'm handsome and I'm talented
And love your bank account #</i>

35:35.833 --> 35:38.875
<i># It's the count, it's the count
It's the count #</i>

35:38.958 --> 35:42.375
<i># It's the count, it's the count
It's the count #</i>

35:42.458 --> 35:45.583
<i># The "C" is for courageous
Just another word for brave #</i>

35:45.667 --> 35:47.208
<i>- # O! #
- # Oh, my God #</i>

35:47.292 --> 35:48.875
<i># What a very handsome knave #</i>

35:48.958 --> 35:51.000
<i>- # U! #
- # Unbelievable good looks #</i>

35:51.083 --> 35:52.333
<i># And brains and heart #</i>

35:52.417 --> 35:53.667
<i>- # N! #
- # For the knowledge #</i>

35:53.750 --> 35:55.583
<i># 'Cause I'm very, very smart #</i>

35:55.667 --> 35:56.875
<i>- # T! #
- # For the talent #</i>

35:56.958 --> 35:58.458
<i># Which is such a crucial factor #</i>

35:58.542 --> 35:59.958
<i># When you're handsome and good-looking #</i>

36:00.042 --> 36:02.250
<i># And the world's greatest actor #</i>

36:02.333 --> 36:04.917
<i># It's the count, it's the count
It's the count #</i>

36:05.000 --> 36:08.500
<i># It's the count, it's the count
It's the count #</i>

36:08.583 --> 36:11.625
<i># Who else has such robust good looks
In such a large amount? #</i>

36:11.708 --> 36:17.500
<i># I'm handsome and I'm talented
And love your bank account #</i>

36:19.583 --> 36:22.750
<i># It's the count, it's the count
It's the count #</i>

36:22.833 --> 36:26.792
<i># It's the count, it's the count #</i>

36:26.875 --> 36:32.708
<i># It's the count #</i>

36:38.500 --> 36:41.000
<i># The count #</i>

36:42.583 --> 36:44.375
Yes, we've met.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.708
Orphans...

36:51.792 --> 36:53.250
this is my theater troupe.

36:53.333 --> 36:54.542
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.292
- Hi.
- Hello.

36:56.375 --> 37:00.333
And as anyone in the theater knows,
after a grand entrance,

37:00.417 --> 37:03.042
the audience is supposed to applaud.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.625
"Applaud" means go like this.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.125
We're not an audience.

37:07.208 --> 37:11.042
No, orphans, you are not.

37:11.125 --> 37:15.167
But we have been preparing
an exciting new production

37:15.250 --> 37:18.250
that, on opening night,
will change your life.

37:18.333 --> 37:23.042
All of the artistic and financial aspects
of my career are finally coming together

37:23.125 --> 37:26.708
like two pieces of a bread
in the middle of a sandwich.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.039
Bread goes on the outside of a
sandwich.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.292
What my sister means is that...

37:31.375 --> 37:32.667
I don't care what she means.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.542
I don't have time to learn
a second language

37:34.625 --> 37:36.750
besides whatever it is
I'm speaking right now.

37:36.833 --> 37:40.833
In any case,
we demand congratulations.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.208
Congratulations.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.167
A big round of applause.

37:50.708 --> 37:54.250
And the delicious meal that you promised
myself and my troupe.

37:54.646 --> 37:56.646
We need a few minutes, you scoundrel.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.583
You know, every time she talks,

37:58.667 --> 38:01.708
it's like the tines of a fork
are being jammed into my...

38:01.792 --> 38:03.708
What my sister means is,
dinner will be served shortly.

38:03.792 --> 38:05.083
What are we supposed to do until then?

38:05.167 --> 38:08.417
- We could wait patiently.
- How about some wine, Olaf?

38:08.500 --> 38:10.625
Yes, yes, wine.
We had that nice rose last time.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.750
It wasn't rose, it was just watered down.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.875
Okay, fine.
I'll open up a box of the Merlot.

38:25.833 --> 38:29.375
An associate of mine
named Brillat-Savarin famously said:

38:29.458 --> 38:33.375
"To invite people to dine with us
is to make ourselves responsible

38:33.458 --> 38:36.167
<i>for their well-being
as long as they are under our roofs."</i>

38:36.875 --> 38:39.833
<i>But he was an 18th century philosopher
and gourmand...</i>

38:41.167 --> 38:44.583
<i>and these were three children
with very little catering experience.</i>

38:49.958 --> 38:53.583
Nevertheless, the Baudelaire orphans
snapped into action.

38:53.667 --> 38:57.042
This pasta maker reminds me
of the one built by Thomas Jefferson.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.125
Will it work?

38:59.333 --> 39:01.250
It will now.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.542
I wonder if Count Olaf's troupe
will enjoy this meal.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.750
Mother said that actors will eat anything.

39:06.208 --> 39:08.875
You've seen them perform.
Would you call them actors?

39:08.958 --> 39:11.250
They're all as talented as Count Olaf.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.125
<i>While they waited
for the pasta to boil,</i>

39:13.208 --> 39:16.000
<i>Violet sauteed the garlic,
and washed and chopped the anchovies.</i>

39:16.083 --> 39:18.583
<i>Klaus peeled the tomatoes
and pitted the olives.</i>

39:18.667 --> 39:20.292
And Sunny banged on a pot
with a wooden spoon,

39:20.375 --> 39:23.458
singing a rather repetitive song
she had written herself.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.458
By the time it was time
for the youngest Baudelaire

39:28.542 --> 39:30.125
to chop the parsley with her teeth...

39:32.708 --> 39:35.792
all three children felt less miserable
than they had...

39:36.292 --> 39:38.625
<i>since they first came to Count Olaf's.</i>

39:38.708 --> 39:40.958
I think Dad would be proud of this sauce.

39:41.042 --> 39:44.083
And I think Mom would be proud
of how you made your own pasta.

39:44.583 --> 39:47.542
Maybe we can make this our home after all.

39:48.458 --> 39:51.042
Remember what Father said
when he burnt the quesadillas?

39:51.125 --> 39:52.167
Yeah.

39:53.292 --> 39:54.375
"Better than nothing."

39:58.583 --> 40:03.042
At times like these,
surrounded by colleagues and cohorts,

40:03.125 --> 40:07.167
gathered in fellowship
for the purpose of plotting theater,

40:07.250 --> 40:10.875
there's an eternal question
that always springs to mind...

40:11.833 --> 40:14.625
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO EAT?

40:18.958 --> 40:20.125
Dinner is served.

40:20.208 --> 40:23.125
- Wow, that was quick.
- And it smells delicious.

40:23.208 --> 40:25.500
I mean...

40:27.000 --> 40:31.125
As I was saying,
before the help interrupted...

40:32.750 --> 40:35.583
there is no "I" in acting...

40:36.208 --> 40:39.542
no selfish urges, no arrogance,

40:39.625 --> 40:42.333
no ego, no vanity,

40:42.417 --> 40:46.792
no dangerous overabundance
of inflated self-regard.

40:47.708 --> 40:52.792
There is only what the French call
a certain... <i>"escargot"</i>.

40:52.875 --> 40:53.958
Mmm-hmm.

40:54.042 --> 40:58.250
It is the first burst of applause
when the curtain rises.

40:58.333 --> 41:01.000
The second burst of applause

41:01.083 --> 41:04.958
when the leading man
glides out from the wings,

41:05.042 --> 41:09.458
faces his crowd and recites the...

41:09.542 --> 41:11.250
Soliloquy.

41:12.833 --> 41:16.417
I'm... That's... His soliloquy.

41:17.333 --> 41:21.542
It is the thrill of the 14th mandatory
standing ovation.

41:22.417 --> 41:26.042
I give and I give to my public

41:26.125 --> 41:30.458
just as I give and I give
to these orphans.

41:30.542 --> 41:33.625
But sometimes,
and every actor does this,

41:33.708 --> 41:36.125
I ask myself, "Is it worth it?

41:36.625 --> 41:39.833
Is it really worth it to chase
an enormous fortune?"

41:39.917 --> 41:41.250
Boss...

41:44.042 --> 41:45.917
- Where's the roast beef?
- What?

41:48.833 --> 41:51.417
The roast beef.

41:51.500 --> 41:55.708
We didn't make any roast beef.
We made puttanesca sauce.

41:55.792 --> 41:57.167
And homemade pasta.

41:57.250 --> 41:59.625
What? No roast beef?

41:59.708 --> 42:02.417
You didn't tell us you wanted roast beef.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.958
Look at my guests!

42:04.042 --> 42:07.667
They... they can hardly touch
this revolting foreign food.

42:16.125 --> 42:21.958
In agreeing to adopt you,
I became your father.

42:22.042 --> 42:27.583
And as your father,
I am not someone to be trifled with.

42:27.667 --> 42:30.250
You can't go easy on children. They need
to be taught to obey their elders.

42:30.333 --> 42:31.583
You asked them to make dinner.

42:31.667 --> 42:34.083
And all they did was slap together
some disgusting sauce.

42:34.167 --> 42:37.833
That's what happens with wealthy kids.
Money is really a corrupting influence.

42:37.917 --> 42:39.458
Well, let's not get carried away.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.167
Hmm. You're a pretty little one.

42:42.250 --> 42:46.375
I demand that you serve roast beef
to myself and my guests!

42:46.458 --> 42:49.625
We don't have any.
We made pasta puttanesca.

42:50.225 --> 42:52.225
And chocolate puddin for dessert.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.375
- Sunny!
- Put her down.

42:55.458 --> 42:58.833
Alas, poor Sunny.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.917
Let her go!

43:08.667 --> 43:10.167
Oh, oh.

43:19.792 --> 43:23.708
This table is a mess.
There's hardly a place to put down a baby.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.125
Sunny!

43:30.958 --> 43:32.500
We're leaving for rehearsals.

43:32.583 --> 43:34.000
But the baby said
there was chocolate pudding!

43:34.083 --> 43:35.250
Shh.

43:35.333 --> 43:37.833
You children are to clean the table,

43:37.917 --> 43:40.500
and wash the dishes,
and polish the silver,

43:40.583 --> 43:42.875
and rinse out all the wine bottles
for recycling.

43:42.958 --> 43:44.958
And then you are to go
straight to your beds.

43:45.042 --> 43:46.583
You mean our bed?

43:47.292 --> 43:49.333
You've only provided us with one bed.

43:50.750 --> 43:53.083
If you want another bed,

43:53.167 --> 43:56.208
tomorrow you may go into town
and purchase one.

43:56.292 --> 43:58.125
You know perfectly well
we haven't any money.

43:58.208 --> 44:00.083
Hmm. Of course you do.

44:00.167 --> 44:05.000
You three lucky orphans
are inheriting an enormous fortune.

44:05.083 --> 44:07.708
The money our parents left behind
is not to be used until Violet...

44:09.083 --> 44:11.083
Oooh!

44:18.542 --> 44:20.250
The theater awaits.

44:31.208 --> 44:33.583
- Are you all right?
- No.

44:34.708 --> 44:36.708
- This isn't.
- What?

44:37.958 --> 44:40.250
Better than nothing.

44:53.542 --> 44:56.583
There are many, many things
that are better than nothing.

44:56.667 --> 44:59.042
A home-cooked meal is better than nothing.

45:01.208 --> 45:03.917
A roof over one's head
is better than nothing.

45:05.750 --> 45:06.958
And a place to sleep,

45:07.042 --> 45:10.208
even if the bed is very small
and the blanket damp with tears,

45:10.292 --> 45:11.708
is better than nothing.

45:25.250 --> 45:28.250
But being raised in a violent
and sinister environment

45:28.333 --> 45:32.417
by a man more interested in one's fortune
than comfort and well-being

45:32.500 --> 45:34.167
is not better than nothing.

45:34.250 --> 45:35.917
And as the Baudelaires would discover,

45:36.000 --> 45:39.625
there are some things
that even a long night of introspection

45:39.708 --> 45:41.000
cannot change.

46:08.292 --> 46:10.667
<i>The Baudelaire orphans
knew they had to find a way</i>

46:10.750 --> 46:13.250
<i>out of their dreadfully
unfortunate circumstances,</i>

46:13.333 --> 46:17.333
<i>and, perhaps, solve the mystery
of how they ended up in them.</i>

46:21.250 --> 46:24.292
I have the same dedication
to researching and presenting this story

46:24.375 --> 46:26.417
no matter what dangers it puts me in.

46:26.500 --> 46:30.042
Trouble and strife can cover this world
like the dark of night,

46:30.125 --> 46:32.750
or like smoke from a suspicious fire.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.500
And when that happens...

46:49.708 --> 46:53.417
all good, true and decent people
know that it's time to volunteer.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.347
<i>"Baudelaire mansion destroyed"</i>

46:59.917 --> 47:03.083
- I'm worried about the children.
- Me, too.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.792
They're in danger, I know it.

47:04.875 --> 47:06.542
We need to get to them.

47:06.625 --> 47:08.833
We need to get out of here first.

47:08.917 --> 47:12.500
What's that thing Einstein said?
