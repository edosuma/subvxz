Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

00:27.142 --> 00:30.110
For those of you who
don't go to the movies

00:30.112 --> 00:32.514
or to the theater
or watch television,

00:33.514 --> 00:35.582
let me introduce myself.

00:35.584 --> 00:38.485
My name is Peter O'Toole.

00:41.123 --> 00:42.090
Quite.

00:43.492 --> 00:46.525
For one reason or another,
the motion picture

00:46.527 --> 00:50.629
you are about to watch is
not very clear in parts.

00:50.631 --> 00:53.132
As a matter of fact, it
was made to demonstrate

00:53.134 --> 00:55.469
how not to make a motion picture

00:55.471 --> 00:58.708
and at the same time
win an Academy Award.

01:00.042 --> 01:02.074
In fact, Solomon
at the front office

01:02.076 --> 01:03.643
has thought the occasional word

01:03.645 --> 01:06.579
from me might clarify the plot

01:06.581 --> 01:10.216
and any other vague
portions of the film.

01:10.218 --> 01:12.587
In my view, fat chance.

01:14.155 --> 01:17.592
Still, if you're sitting
comfortably, let us begin.

01:52.895 --> 01:56.563
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the beginning

01:56.565 --> 01:59.266
of the journey in
which two brothers,

01:59.268 --> 02:01.471
Oliver and Stanley Rosenblum,

02:02.538 --> 02:05.041
make their way to a mythical
place called El Dorado,

02:07.175 --> 02:10.743
as depicted in the poem
by Edgar Allan Poe.

02:10.745 --> 02:15.548
But first, they have to appear
at the Las Vegas amphitheater

02:15.550 --> 02:17.951
for a very strange group.

02:17.953 --> 02:19.852
Well I hardly know
how to describe.

02:19.854 --> 02:20.923
Whatever, you'll see.

02:29.298 --> 02:30.630
Good evening
ladies and gentlemen,

02:30.632 --> 02:32.197
and welcome to the
Nevada Amphitheater

02:32.199 --> 02:33.666
in downtown Las Vegas.

02:33.668 --> 02:37.036
Well here it is the
late '70s going on 1985.

02:37.038 --> 02:38.672
You know most of the
music we hear today

02:38.674 --> 02:41.708
is nothing more than
pre-programmed electronic disco.

02:41.710 --> 02:43.275
We very rarely get
a chance to hear

02:43.277 --> 02:45.879
master blues men practicing
their craft anymore.

02:45.881 --> 02:48.013
By the year 2020, the
music known as the blues

02:48.015 --> 02:50.249
will only exist in the
classical record department

02:50.251 --> 02:51.718
of your local library.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.153
So while we still can,

02:53.155 --> 02:55.721
please welcome from Rock
Island, Illinois the blues music

02:55.723 --> 02:57.592
of Oliver and Stanley Rosenblum:

02:58.727 --> 03:00.292
The Jews brothers.

03:03.632 --> 03:05.098
Shit!

03:05.100 --> 03:07.367
Get to the Jew boys!

03:07.369 --> 03:09.205
Sieg Heil!

03:41.168 --> 03:43.636
I want those Jews
brothers roasting

03:43.638 --> 03:45.672
on a German spit, yeah.

03:45.674 --> 03:47.641
This is America
land of the free,

03:47.643 --> 03:50.275
and I want them
free and over easy.

03:59.353 --> 04:01.921
Why are we performing
to neo-Nazis, Oliver?

04:01.923 --> 04:04.423
It was supposed
to be a bar mitzvah, Stanley.

04:04.425 --> 04:05.595
Whose?

04:07.128 --> 04:10.362
Do you think they're
firing real bullets at us?

04:10.364 --> 04:12.999
Does that answer
your question?

04:36.357 --> 04:38.360
I've been shot!

04:40.195 --> 04:41.761
Are we going to
the casino, Oliver?

04:41.763 --> 04:42.896
With what?

04:42.898 --> 04:44.330
Didn't we get paid
from the last gig?

04:44.332 --> 04:45.999
I don't think any
California neo-Nazi party

04:46.001 --> 04:48.100
were interested in paying
for any form of entertainment

04:48.102 --> 04:50.335
from two Jewish entertainers,
Stanley, do you?

04:50.337 --> 04:52.004
Maybe not, Ollie.

04:59.181 --> 05:01.417
Wanna have some fun, huh?

05:22.503 --> 05:23.836
Hello!

05:23.838 --> 05:26.773
JJ Hamilton, an
agency for the, hello?

05:26.775 --> 05:27.973
Hello!

05:27.975 --> 05:29.477
This can't be a prank
phone call, I.

05:33.448 --> 05:34.747
Hello?

05:34.749 --> 05:36.949
JJ Hamilton, Agency
for Gifted People!

05:36.951 --> 05:38.852
So what about people
without a bullet proof vest?

05:38.854 --> 05:40.252
What?

05:40.254 --> 05:42.088
JJ, can you hear me?

05:42.090 --> 05:43.556
Yeah, I can hear you.

05:43.558 --> 05:44.456
Who is that?

05:44.458 --> 05:46.191
It's Oliver Rosenblum.

05:46.193 --> 05:47.427
- Who?
- Oliver Rosenblum.

05:47.429 --> 05:49.028
From the Jews brothers.

05:49.030 --> 05:50.028
Oliver!

05:50.030 --> 05:51.864
Oliver, how's my
favorite client?

05:51.866 --> 05:53.165
How's the show going?

05:53.167 --> 05:55.201
JJ, we were fired at.

05:55.203 --> 05:56.502
No problem, don't worry.

05:56.504 --> 05:58.872
Even the best of 'em get
fired once and a while.

05:58.874 --> 06:00.239
- It happens.
- No, JJ.

06:00.241 --> 06:01.775
We were shot at.

06:01.777 --> 06:02.775
Shot at?

06:02.777 --> 06:04.410
What kind of bat
mitzvah is this?

06:04.412 --> 06:05.511
There was no bat mitzvah, JJ.

06:05.513 --> 06:07.179
The roasting these
guys wanted to do

06:07.181 --> 06:08.514
was of me and Stan.

06:10.251 --> 06:11.384
Whoa, hold on there, Oliver.

06:11.386 --> 06:12.552
I got another call.

06:12.554 --> 06:14.987
JJ, we need to
get some work quick.

06:14.989 --> 06:16.790
Just a second, okay?

06:16.792 --> 06:19.191
Just stay on the line,
okay, stay on the line.

06:19.193 --> 06:21.393
I'm very busy, but I
always have time for you.

06:21.395 --> 06:23.295
Just stay on the line.

06:23.297 --> 06:25.465
Hello, hello, hello!

06:25.467 --> 06:27.566
Agency for the Stars.

06:27.568 --> 06:30.270
JJ, is that you, you asshole?

06:30.272 --> 06:31.336
What's wrong, Leslie?

06:31.338 --> 06:32.437
What's wrong?

06:32.439 --> 06:34.506
You've done it again.

06:34.508 --> 06:35.809
I thought you were sending me

06:35.811 --> 06:37.910
to some kinky Nazi
party convention.

06:37.912 --> 06:40.246
I get there and this guy
starts giving me shit

06:40.248 --> 06:42.816
because I tossed my
G-string into the fountain,

06:42.818 --> 06:45.951
the same time as they dip a
baby's head into the basin.

06:45.953 --> 06:48.321
How did I know it
was a bat mitzvah?

06:48.323 --> 06:50.189
I thought the stage was done
for something a little hinky,

06:50.191 --> 06:52.424
a bit of water sports maybe.

06:52.426 --> 06:53.559
I don't know about bat mitzvahs.

06:53.561 --> 06:55.828
I'm a stripper, JJ.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.963
They wanted a Blues
Brothers tribute act.

06:57.965 --> 06:59.264
A Jewish which Blues Brothers,

06:59.266 --> 07:02.035
like those other
assholes you represent?

07:02.037 --> 07:05.441
Leslie, now Stanley and Oliver
are professional musicians.

07:06.941 --> 07:09.174
Well it's my pink pussy
that makes you the money.

07:09.176 --> 07:10.212
Remember that, JJ.

07:11.378 --> 07:13.312
How am I gonna sing
the blues with my tits?

07:13.314 --> 07:14.547
Hold on, Lesllie.

07:14.549 --> 07:16.148
Maybe I can find
ya something else.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.917
That's it!

07:17.919 --> 07:20.153
I think I found the
ideal gig for both of ya.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.622
They want a stripper and a band,

07:22.624 --> 07:23.989
and I think you can even take

07:23.991 --> 07:25.490
your half-wit boyfriend with ya.

07:25.492 --> 07:27.559
Now listen, listen
hard and listen quick.

07:27.561 --> 07:31.030
I want you to make a
left on route 66, okay?

07:31.032 --> 07:33.198
That's right near Boon's
Diner and Gas Station,

07:33.200 --> 07:35.201
but don't be late, they
want you for dinner.

07:35.203 --> 07:36.501
Okay, Leslie, gotta go.

07:36.503 --> 07:37.569
Bye bye, bye bye.

07:38.405 --> 07:39.240
- Mwah!
- JJ!

07:40.107 --> 07:41.609
Yeah, Oliver, Oliver.

07:42.544 --> 07:43.946
Oliver, my boy.

07:44.946 --> 07:46.379
I don't know how you did it,

07:46.381 --> 07:49.415
but somehow you got mixed
up at Leslie's show.

07:49.417 --> 07:50.549
Well, I didn't
make the booking.

07:50.551 --> 07:52.417
No, no you didn't.

07:52.419 --> 07:54.153
But I think I got a
winner for ya here.

07:54.155 --> 07:55.590
Are you sure this time?

07:56.290 --> 07:57.590
Would I lie to ya, Ollie?

07:57.592 --> 07:59.492
Come on, I got you covered.

07:59.494 --> 08:02.194
It's the same show as
Leslie, different night.

08:02.196 --> 08:04.532
Okay, take down the details.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.335
So, as Oliver and
Stanley get the address

08:09.337 --> 08:12.071
to their next who in El Dorado,

08:12.073 --> 08:15.908
unknown to them, someone else
who will cross their path

08:15.910 --> 08:20.112
is making a surprise
return visit to her husband

08:20.114 --> 08:24.650
on the other side of town
at a strip club called

08:24.652 --> 08:26.455
the Vertical Smile.

08:27.989 --> 08:32.994
Yeah, this is what you
call matrimonial bliss.

08:34.162 --> 08:35.631
You better come
and do that now.

08:37.398 --> 08:38.631
What's going on?

08:38.633 --> 08:39.534
Who is she, Roy?

08:40.601 --> 08:42.470
What are you
talking about, Darlin?

08:44.705 --> 08:45.874
Get up.

08:49.109 --> 08:52.214
You'll need that to take the
taste away before you leave.

08:55.517 --> 08:57.583
Ah, sweetie pie.

08:57.585 --> 09:00.285
It was only a
slight indiscretion.

09:00.287 --> 09:01.123
Come back!

09:04.258 --> 09:06.626
Meanwhile the boys are finding

09:06.628 --> 09:09.661
that getting to El
Dorado is not easy,

09:09.663 --> 09:14.232
even after getting shot at
by neo-Nazis and ex-wives.

09:14.234 --> 09:17.270
So the question is,
what else can happen?

09:17.272 --> 09:19.005
What the hell was that?

09:19.007 --> 09:20.305
We have a flat.

09:20.307 --> 09:21.240
What, again?

09:34.556 --> 09:37.490
Now we have the scene
where the spurned wife

09:37.492 --> 09:41.361
meets our heroes down
that dusty back road

09:41.363 --> 09:43.663
leading to El Dorado.

09:43.665 --> 09:46.735
Is she the good
Samaritan they need?

09:51.071 --> 09:52.273
Ow!

10:55.135 --> 10:56.836
Where the hell are you going?

10:56.838 --> 10:58.374
I think I can see something?

11:35.176 --> 11:36.409
Hoo!

11:36.411 --> 11:39.478
Who was eating them
goddamned beans again?

11:51.625 --> 11:52.791
So where the
hell have you been?

11:52.793 --> 11:54.861
I think I found some help.

11:54.863 --> 11:55.862
Where?

11:55.864 --> 11:56.728
There, in the desert.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.131
There's about 50 of them.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.532
They look like good ole boys.

12:00.534 --> 12:02.200
We don't need
any help, Stanley.

12:02.202 --> 12:03.805
The car's fixed; let's go.

12:12.614 --> 12:13.679
Shit.

12:13.681 --> 12:14.881
Well, what's wrong, Ollie?

12:14.883 --> 12:17.349
We've ran out of gas.

12:17.851 --> 12:20.152
Looks like we've got a
hole in our tank, Stanley.

12:20.154 --> 12:22.420
I can fix it, but we
ain't got any gas.

12:22.422 --> 12:23.892
Well, what are we gonna do?

12:25.159 --> 12:27.160
You better show me where
those good ole boys are.

12:27.162 --> 12:28.397
I just hope we don't get raped.

12:33.401 --> 12:34.867
Well they look all right.

12:34.869 --> 12:36.839
Well looks can be
deceiving, Stanley.

12:38.605 --> 12:40.609
They sure can, boys.

12:44.811 --> 12:47.246
What are these dudes wearing?

12:47.248 --> 12:49.549
Are they supposed
to be undertakers?

12:49.551 --> 12:51.817
We're the Jews Brothers.

12:51.819 --> 12:53.319
Jews Brothers?

12:53.321 --> 12:56.856
Shit, look more like
the ugly brothers to me.

12:56.858 --> 12:59.992
You make fun of me,
you ugly son of a bitch?

12:59.994 --> 13:03.462
My brother will whip your ass.

13:03.464 --> 13:04.796
Is that a fact?

13:04.798 --> 13:06.766
He's speaking for himself.

13:06.768 --> 13:08.867
That's not what
short-stop said,

13:08.869 --> 13:10.402
is it short-stop?

13:10.404 --> 13:11.603
Let me have him.

13:11.605 --> 13:14.740
I could do with the exercise.

13:16.677 --> 13:18.813
- I'm a lover, not a fighter.
- Good!

13:20.380 --> 13:24.916
You'll fuck first, then you
can fight for your life.

13:25.787 --> 13:28.721
- Strip, big boy.
- What?

13:28.723 --> 13:29.921
You heard the lady.

13:29.923 --> 13:31.656
Get your duds off.

15:12.726 --> 15:14.395
You got off lightly, stranger.

15:15.562 --> 15:17.063
But remember we
don't wanna see you

15:17.065 --> 15:17.963
around these parts again.

15:17.965 --> 15:19.700
You understand?

15:39.686 --> 15:40.920
Yo, Stanley.

15:40.922 --> 15:42.454
Don't drop rubbish on the floor.

15:42.456 --> 15:43.859
Aren't we in enough trouble?

15:48.995 --> 15:51.030
Are you guys lost?

15:51.032 --> 15:52.030
Well, we've been kidnapped.

15:52.032 --> 15:52.964
Kidnapped?

15:52.966 --> 15:54.635
Yeah, it's a long story.

15:55.736 --> 15:57.035
Could you give us a lift?

15:57.037 --> 15:59.104
- Where to?
- About 20 miles that way.

15:59.106 --> 16:00.705
Sure can, why
don't you get on in.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.854
You boys all
ready for the feast?

16:15.856 --> 16:17.790
Sure am, Mayor.

16:17.792 --> 16:18.958
- Sure am.
- Very nice, Tommy.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.659
What you got there?

16:20.661 --> 16:22.428
Don't hide it, don't hide it.

16:22.430 --> 16:23.728
It's nipples, sure enough.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.964
I like to suck on a
teat now and then.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.733
Hmm, very tasty.

16:28.735 --> 16:30.571
Very tasty, isn't
that right, Lemmas?

16:32.105 --> 16:34.173
But how do you know
they're female?

16:34.175 --> 16:36.442
They're the ones
without the hair attached,

16:36.444 --> 16:37.675
can't you tell?

16:38.779 --> 16:39.612
Well said, Tommy.

16:39.614 --> 16:40.813
Very well said.

16:40.815 --> 16:43.149
I do like the taste
of shortbreads.

16:43.151 --> 16:46.017
Can't beat the sound of
that plop in your mouth

16:46.019 --> 16:48.087
when you bite in that ball.

16:49.423 --> 16:50.925
Delicious, eh Lemmas?

16:52.192 --> 16:54.727
Look, all ready
for the festival.

16:56.730 --> 16:57.997
You got a nice
little something

16:57.999 --> 17:00.402
I could take home for my
dinner tonight, Lemmas?

17:05.005 --> 17:05.839
Hold on.

17:12.512 --> 17:14.146
What's your fancy, Mayor?

17:14.147 --> 17:16.146
I bit kinder, you
know how Ma Louise

17:16.148 --> 17:19.018
likes a nice bit of
lean breast, no fat.

17:19.020 --> 17:19.921
Coming right up.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.398
She does carry on
a bit, don't she?

18:43.603 --> 18:44.970
Darling!

18:44.972 --> 18:49.140
Nothing was happening, I swear.

18:49.142 --> 18:52.043
Why would I want
anybody but you?

18:52.045 --> 18:55.981
I can see naked girls
any day of the week,

18:55.983 --> 18:58.220
but it's you that makes
me hard, sweet pea.

18:59.853 --> 19:01.153
Come back.

19:01.155 --> 19:02.523
I wanna give you something.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.624
Please come back.

19:05.626 --> 19:06.291
Ah, don't beg.

19:06.293 --> 19:07.161
It sounds pitiful.

19:08.763 --> 19:10.698
At least let me remember
you the way that you are,

19:11.565 --> 19:13.000
a sniveling little rat.

19:15.136 --> 19:16.638
Oh, and by the way sweetheart.

19:17.972 --> 19:20.242
Do you remember that suitcase
you left in the loft?

19:21.809 --> 19:23.809
What suitcase?

19:23.811 --> 19:25.644
Oh, you know darling.

19:25.646 --> 19:27.279
The nice little silver
one in the cupboard

19:27.281 --> 19:29.315
with all the money in it.

19:29.317 --> 19:30.715
Why don't we call it a payoff

19:30.717 --> 19:32.186
for all the years
that I gave you?

19:33.286 --> 19:34.955
Oh, and by the way, Roy.

19:35.956 --> 19:37.191
Goodbye, sweetheart.

19:50.236 --> 19:51.238
You want something, Missy?

19:52.907 --> 19:54.306
Fill up my baby, laughing boy,

19:54.308 --> 19:56.107
and check under
the hood, will you?

19:56.109 --> 19:57.111
Will do.

19:58.311 --> 20:00.178
Is there a packet
of cigarettes there?

20:00.180 --> 20:03.281
Just as soon as I've
sorted out your car.

20:03.283 --> 20:04.282
Great.

20:04.284 --> 20:05.250
You got a wash room?

20:05.252 --> 20:06.751
Out back, wash basin, too.

20:06.753 --> 20:09.253
To cool off in all this heat.

20:17.665 --> 20:19.834
See you got a pussy wagon.

20:22.436 --> 20:24.339
Oh god, what's that smell?

20:27.241 --> 20:28.674
That'll fuck her chances

20:28.676 --> 20:32.310
of getting out of
Death Valley now.

20:40.987 --> 20:41.855
Ugh, god.

21:36.744 --> 21:39.278
Meanwhile, back at the
front of the gas station,

21:39.280 --> 21:42.114
Oliver and Stanley
arrive trying to find

21:42.116 --> 21:45.353
the town of El Dorado and
a dentist for Stanley.

21:46.352 --> 21:48.322
What they really need is a map.

21:53.994 --> 21:55.397
Anyone at home?

21:56.830 --> 21:59.234
Yo, I said is anyone at home?

22:00.301 --> 22:01.336
Maybe we should go?

22:02.736 --> 22:04.168
Go where, Stanley?

22:04.170 --> 22:06.437
We're lost, unless you
know the way to El Dorado?

22:06.439 --> 22:07.940
No.

22:07.942 --> 22:10.309
Stanley, if you don't
know and I don't know,

22:10.311 --> 22:12.310
maybe we should ask
someone who does,

22:12.312 --> 22:13.345
you know what I mean?

22:13.347 --> 22:14.349
Yeah.

22:17.818 --> 22:20.388
Hey, it's the
Soggy Bottom Boys.

22:22.055 --> 22:23.955
The Soggy Bottom Boys shit.

22:23.957 --> 22:26.290
We're the Jews Brothers
from Chicago, Illinois,

22:26.292 --> 22:29.228
and we're looking for the
town called El Dorado, mister.

22:29.230 --> 22:30.995
You don't know
the way, do you?

22:30.997 --> 22:31.930
You bet.

22:31.932 --> 22:33.464
I was born and bred there.

22:33.466 --> 22:35.466
El Dorado, no town like it.

22:35.468 --> 22:40.475
Anyway, it says here you're
the Soggy Bottom Boys.

22:43.010 --> 22:46.377
Now, Sir, do we look like
the Soggy Bottom Boys to you?

22:46.379 --> 22:47.215
You do there.

22:52.852 --> 22:54.488
I think we need
a new agent, Ollie.

23:00.895 --> 23:02.461
Do you have a restroom?

23:02.463 --> 23:03.427
What?

23:03.429 --> 23:05.597
I need to have
a pee, you know.

23:05.599 --> 23:07.432
Oh, it's out of order.

23:07.434 --> 23:08.901
Out of order?

23:08.903 --> 23:13.070
Yeah, something
died in there, hoo!

23:13.072 --> 23:15.072
If I don't find
a restroom fast,

23:15.074 --> 23:16.841
something's gonna die here.

23:16.843 --> 23:18.443
I'm sorry, it's locked.

23:18.445 --> 23:20.849
Oh, I'll find somewhere else.

23:32.458 --> 23:33.992
So, do you know
where El Dorado is?

23:33.994 --> 23:35.493
You bet.

23:35.495 --> 23:38.496
Well would you like to enlighten
me with your knowledge?

23:38.498 --> 23:40.264
It's about four
miles down the road,

23:40.266 --> 23:43.367
and you'll see a sign
post on the left.

23:47.273 --> 23:48.473
You wouldn't
know where to find

23:48.475 --> 23:49.875
a good dentist
around these parts?

23:49.877 --> 23:51.409
I sure do, mister.

23:51.411 --> 23:53.412
That'd be Doc Martin.

23:53.414 --> 23:55.848
He's on your way out there,

23:55.850 --> 23:57.918
around 10 miles the
other side of town.

23:59.119 --> 24:01.185
He's a good sort of
bones, old Doc Martin.

24:01.187 --> 24:02.921
And he won't cost
you much, either.

24:02.923 --> 24:04.092
Thanks!

24:07.026 --> 24:09.126
So where did you go?

24:09.128 --> 24:10.197
I'll tell ya later.

24:19.473 --> 24:21.542
Are you sure this
is the way, Ollie?

24:22.943 --> 24:24.479
That's what it
says on the card.

24:27.147 --> 24:28.416
Oh, my tooth.

24:34.455 --> 24:35.956
I think we found it.

24:49.302 --> 24:51.536
Hey, buddy, we're looking
for the Doc Martin.

24:51.538 --> 24:56.077
Does he live around here?

25:01.314 --> 25:02.282
Who wants him?

25:04.385 --> 25:06.521
My brother needs a
dentist, that's all.

25:08.955 --> 25:10.655
I like you boys,
you pay in cash.

25:10.657 --> 25:13.492
That's a real good way
to start a relationship.

25:13.494 --> 25:18.129
- Will it hurt?
- Ooh, do you want it to?

25:18.131 --> 25:18.966
No!

25:20.100 --> 25:22.567
- Well, you're the customer.
- Ollie!

25:22.569 --> 25:24.202
Nothing to worry
about, my little friend.

25:24.204 --> 25:25.937
I rarely miss that vein,

25:25.939 --> 25:28.272
and if I do, the second
one's on the house.

25:28.274 --> 25:29.509
That's not bad.

25:35.448 --> 25:37.581
Hold 'em down.

25:43.357 --> 25:45.057
Whoa, oh, oh, oh.

25:45.059 --> 25:45.926
Oh, oh, oh!

25:47.962 --> 25:51.430
Ooh!

25:51.432 --> 25:53.065
Hmmm, I got it.

25:53.067 --> 25:53.902
Oh, oh.

25:57.571 --> 25:59.040
Yeah.

26:01.207 --> 26:03.607
Now get down to
the real business.

26:03.609 --> 26:05.245
This is the part I like.

26:06.647 --> 26:09.181
Kind of like digging for gold.

26:09.183 --> 26:11.015
Hell, you never know
what you're gonna find.

26:13.654 --> 26:15.520
I think you'd better
wait in the other room.

26:15.522 --> 26:16.655
That's good.

26:16.657 --> 26:19.023
I get real jumpy around
drills, you know?

26:19.025 --> 26:20.128
Yeah, most people do.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.599
Lots of frillies,
but no money.

26:28.601 --> 26:30.003
Shit, shit, shit!

26:33.706 --> 26:35.240
Bobby phone?

26:35.242 --> 26:36.077
Bobby phone?

26:41.014 --> 26:41.648
What?

26:42.582 --> 26:43.647
Jessica, you bitch.

26:43.649 --> 26:45.584
Are you there?

26:45.586 --> 26:47.551
You can't do this to me.

26:47.553 --> 26:49.023
It's my fucking money.

26:50.123 --> 26:51.725
You know who you're
fucking with!

26:53.127 --> 26:55.159
Wrong number, tough guy.

27:35.569 --> 27:37.569
Don't worry little lady.

27:37.571 --> 27:39.741
I haven't forgot about you.

27:45.378 --> 27:46.214
Oh!

27:48.115 --> 27:49.447
Let me see your breasts!

27:56.657 --> 28:00.261
I love to feel the smooth
texture of your skin.

28:02.161 --> 28:04.495
I like to stroke the smooth skin

28:04.497 --> 28:05.732
and firm breasts.

28:15.609 --> 28:16.707
No!

28:24.751 --> 28:26.651
You smell real good.

28:26.653 --> 28:28.356
You smell like
dead fish up there.

28:30.189 --> 28:31.490
Were you playing
with your boyfriend

28:31.492 --> 28:33.795
before I found you on the layby?

28:38.398 --> 28:40.635
You won't be performing
at our festival.

28:41.834 --> 28:43.702
You'll be the main course.

28:51.244 --> 28:53.244
Don't cry, little girl.

28:53.246 --> 28:54.678
Don't cry.

28:54.680 --> 28:58.151
Daddy will only kill
you if you tell a lie.

28:59.753 --> 29:02.790
Let me smell those water
spots between your thighs.

29:04.457 --> 29:07.661
Let me wipe away those tears
from your eyes before you die.

29:12.832 --> 29:14.368
I loved poetry at school.

29:16.270 --> 29:17.105
Can't you tell?

29:25.745 --> 29:26.944
No!

29:36.389 --> 29:37.291
Jessica?

29:38.457 --> 29:39.292
Jessica?

29:40.927 --> 29:41.760
You bitch!

29:41.762 --> 29:43.395
You'll pay for that.

29:45.465 --> 29:47.568
- You'll pay for that.
- No!

30:21.234 --> 30:21.869
Jess?

30:25.606 --> 30:26.440
Jess?

30:27.340 --> 30:28.208
Jess!

30:29.342 --> 30:30.210
Jessica!

30:33.946 --> 30:35.248
Jessica!

30:43.724 --> 30:45.560
Your boyfriend tastes good!

30:47.927 --> 30:49.263
You want a bite?

30:50.763 --> 30:52.931
Ted, it's Roy.

30:52.933 --> 30:53.768
I need your help.

30:55.369 --> 30:57.772
Something has happened and I
don't know who else to turn to.

30:59.539 --> 31:00.340
Thanks.

31:12.485 --> 31:13.987
What is this shit?

31:17.657 --> 31:18.825
That's better.

31:24.731 --> 31:25.866
Your brother'll be fine.

31:27.868 --> 31:29.770
So were you in
Vietnam or what?

31:30.736 --> 31:32.470
Oh yeah, many moons ago.

31:32.472 --> 31:34.306
I mean, I don't
mean to pry, you know?

31:34.308 --> 31:34.942
No problem.

31:35.908 --> 31:37.445
Oh, so is that you?

31:38.512 --> 31:39.511
Yeah.

31:39.513 --> 31:40.744
Like I said, many moons ago.

31:40.746 --> 31:41.879
You want a beer?

31:41.881 --> 31:43.315
No, thanks.

31:43.317 --> 31:46.984
So, yeah, it's a nice picture.

31:46.986 --> 31:48.555
We were like the Spartan Army.

31:51.858 --> 31:52.726
300 strong.

31:54.927 --> 31:56.464
We could take on anyone.

32:03.869 --> 32:06.404
300 when we started, anyway.

32:06.406 --> 32:08.839
Good men from good families,

32:08.841 --> 32:11.943
ready and willing to
fight for the cause,

32:11.945 --> 32:15.980
fight the good fight, free
the country of communism,

32:15.982 --> 32:18.015
get rid of the reds.

32:18.017 --> 32:20.484
Red, red, fire in the shed.

32:20.486 --> 32:22.921
I'd rather be dead than red.

32:22.923 --> 32:27.928
One by one we fought until
the cause no longer mattered.

32:28.928 --> 32:30.531
We just wanted to stay
alive, whatever it took.

32:31.398 --> 32:33.100
That 300 became 200,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.069
then 100,

32:36.669 --> 32:40.975
then 50, 20, 10, until it
was only two of us left.

32:43.042 --> 32:44.742
By the end of it,
neither of us knew

32:44.744 --> 32:46.845
what we were fighting for.

32:46.847 --> 32:50.013
It wasn't country or cause.

32:50.015 --> 32:52.018
I'm not even sure it
was for ourselves.

32:53.453 --> 32:55.119
I only knew that I
had to keep going

32:55.121 --> 32:59.924
because one day I'd be
back to a place I loved,

32:59.926 --> 33:01.662
a place where my family lived,

33:02.561 --> 33:05.632
a place I called home.

33:07.067 --> 33:09.403
So you still see him or what?

33:12.738 --> 33:14.806
That's what they gave us.

33:14.808 --> 33:15.643
What?

33:20.813 --> 33:22.550
Nice, real nice.

33:23.550 --> 33:24.918
It's a pocket watch.

33:26.686 --> 33:28.819
That's what they gave us
for serving our country

33:28.821 --> 33:31.524
for six long years,
a pocket watch.

33:32.993 --> 33:35.796
Guess somebody thought that's
all a man's life is worth.

33:36.963 --> 33:40.033
I guess somebody thought that's
all be need is a timepiece

33:41.967 --> 33:44.871
to watch our life ebb away
with no friends by our side.

33:52.545 --> 33:54.178
Now you boys come back
any time you want.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.847
Yeah, we will.

34:09.728 --> 34:10.728
Hiya, Moses.

34:10.730 --> 34:12.063
Hey.

34:12.065 --> 34:15.469
- You got a whiskey for me?
- Sure thing, Mr. Ted.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.507
Mr. Pickleford back there?

34:21.775 --> 34:23.210
Mr. Roy's out back, detective.

34:25.145 --> 34:26.744
Sure do like that shirt.

34:26.746 --> 34:27.581
Thank you.

34:29.081 --> 34:31.916
You want anything else?

34:31.918 --> 34:35.119
Not anything that
anyone else doesn't want.

34:52.138 --> 34:53.637
Come in.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.739
Ah, Ted.

34:55.741 --> 34:57.741
Thank god you're here.

34:57.743 --> 34:58.578
Sit down.

35:00.045 --> 35:01.246
What's going on?

35:01.248 --> 35:04.616
Are you in trouble
with protection again?

35:04.618 --> 35:06.884
No, it's nothing like that.

35:06.886 --> 35:07.720
It's Jessica.

35:09.623 --> 35:12.223
Ah, that little bitch.

35:12.225 --> 35:13.690
What'd she do this time?

35:13.692 --> 35:16.293
Catch you fucking one
of the other girls?

35:16.295 --> 35:17.529
Of course not.

35:17.531 --> 35:19.197
Well, yes she did,

35:19.199 --> 35:21.068
but that's not what
I'm worried about.

35:22.636 --> 35:23.571
She's gone missing,

35:26.072 --> 35:27.208
but with my fucking money.

35:28.208 --> 35:30.041
You try calling her?

35:30.043 --> 35:32.175
Well why didn't
I think of that?

35:32.177 --> 35:34.177
Of course I tried calling her.

35:34.179 --> 35:37.849
The last time I called her,
was somebody else on the line.

35:37.851 --> 35:39.583
Some strange shit,

35:39.585 --> 35:41.018
and there was a noise.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.820
It was a
funny noise on the line.

35:43.822 --> 35:45.088
What kind of noise?

35:45.090 --> 35:47.592
It sounded like
a chainsaw to me,

35:47.594 --> 35:49.561
and there was this screaming.

35:49.563 --> 35:53.167
Screaming like oh my
god, I can't describe.

35:54.768 --> 35:58.239
Sounded to me like someone
was being hurt real bad.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.242
You know what I think?

36:02.641 --> 36:04.675
I think she's just
fucking with your head,

36:04.677 --> 36:07.110
like she's been doing
for a really long time.

36:07.112 --> 36:09.646
I don't understand why you
don't just kill the bitch

36:09.648 --> 36:11.217
and be rid of her
once and for all.

36:15.822 --> 36:20.224
Yeah, well, I guess you
like to fuck dancers.

36:20.226 --> 36:21.195
Who wouldn't?

36:22.596 --> 36:24.264
The thing is, you
can't marry 'em.

36:25.264 --> 36:26.898
You can fuck 'em all day,

36:26.900 --> 36:28.903
but don't put 'em
in your kitchen.

36:30.235 --> 36:33.070
Well thank you for
the information, Ted.

36:33.072 --> 36:34.271
You're welcome.

36:34.273 --> 36:36.340
But that's not why I
asked you to come here.

36:36.342 --> 36:38.076
You see Jessica came back early

36:38.078 --> 36:40.744
from a shopping trip in Reno,

36:40.746 --> 36:43.715
and she found me with
one of the new dancers,

36:43.717 --> 36:45.215
a stupid bitch called Sally.

36:45.217 --> 36:49.152
- That a new girl?
- Yeah, now you wait a minute.

36:51.257 --> 36:53.123
I'm just saying,
I heard a new name

36:53.125 --> 36:55.927
and you know, makes me crazy.

36:55.929 --> 36:57.231
Is that her right there?

36:59.132 --> 37:02.333
You can have Sally as a gift.

37:02.335 --> 37:06.139
I want the bitch
back and my money.

37:07.139 --> 37:08.141
You can fuck her, too,

37:09.308 --> 37:11.210
and I'll hold her down
for you if you like.

37:13.813 --> 37:18.819
Three is a crowd, but I
thank you for the invite.

37:21.888 --> 37:23.223
Now what else can I do for ya?

37:24.757 --> 37:26.690
I want you to put
a trace on my call.

37:26.692 --> 37:28.358
When you get the
address, you tell me.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.228
I'll do the rest.

37:36.136 --> 37:37.137
All right.

37:38.737 --> 37:40.204
Consider it done.

38:02.328 --> 38:05.866
- You got the meat, boy?
- I sure have here.

38:09.768 --> 38:12.136
Hey, hold it right there.

38:12.138 --> 38:15.172
What the hell have you
been doing to that meat?

38:15.174 --> 38:17.909
I just had a little
fun with it first.

38:17.911 --> 38:21.746
I told you, boy, don't
you play with your food!

38:21.748 --> 38:23.317
Now if you're gonna
fuck something,

38:24.918 --> 38:25.753
make sure it's still alive.

38:41.801 --> 38:44.138
What the goddamn hell is that?

38:45.404 --> 38:46.239
Boons.

38:48.308 --> 38:50.677
Jessica, is that you?

38:51.911 --> 38:55.145
Where the hell did
you get this thing?

38:55.147 --> 38:58.215
I took it from the woman
with the fancy car, Lemmas.

38:58.217 --> 39:00.250
What, not one of them?

39:00.252 --> 39:03.356
No, sir, the bitch
with the yellow Trans Am.

39:05.759 --> 39:07.058
Hey, Steve.

39:07.060 --> 39:07.895
It's me, Ted.

39:08.828 --> 39:10.293
You run that trace for me?

39:10.295 --> 39:13.029
Yeah, the signal back
states that the coordinates

39:13.031 --> 39:16.800
for that transmission
is 116.7212,

39:16.802 --> 39:18.936
but it's a little strange, Ted.

39:18.938 --> 39:20.337
Why is that?

39:20.339 --> 39:22.405
Well there's just
no town listed in that area.

39:22.407 --> 39:23.340
There's nothing.

39:23.342 --> 39:24.310
Like absolutely nothing at all.

39:25.444 --> 39:29.248
Well, Steve, I
appreciate the info,

39:30.516 --> 39:32.449
but you need to make sure you
keep everything to yourself.

39:32.451 --> 39:33.985
Do you understand?

39:33.987 --> 39:35.085
Yeah, no problem man.

39:35.087 --> 39:36.055
I owe ya one.

39:38.324 --> 39:40.427
Let's just say that
you're paid in full.

39:43.830 --> 39:45.032
What do you intend to do?

39:47.833 --> 39:51.270
Well, I'm gonna kill the bitch

39:52.605 --> 39:54.806
and whoever else
that bastard was

39:54.808 --> 39:56.275
on the other end of the phone.

39:58.877 --> 40:01.813
Son, do you want somebody
to find out what you're doing?

40:01.815 --> 40:02.547
No, Sir.

40:02.549 --> 40:04.047
Do you want the police to come

40:04.049 --> 40:05.817
and take you away from here?

40:05.819 --> 40:06.453
No, Sir.

40:09.188 --> 40:12.422
Well I don't think we'll be
needing this anymore, do you?

40:12.424 --> 40:13.391
No, Sir.

40:20.232 --> 40:24.270
Boy, I hope you've
learned a lesson today.

40:25.505 --> 40:28.572
Never steal anything
more than you can eat

40:28.574 --> 40:31.541
from those goddamn heathens!

40:31.543 --> 40:33.578
Because they have strange ways

40:33.580 --> 40:36.514
and you don't wanna catch
their strange ways, now do ya?

40:36.516 --> 40:38.248
No, Sir.

40:38.250 --> 40:39.884
They are outsiders

40:39.886 --> 40:41.384
and they will remain outsiders.

40:41.386 --> 40:43.119
Do you understand?

40:43.121 --> 40:43.991
Yes, Sir.

40:48.393 --> 40:49.626
Okay, it's all right.

40:49.628 --> 40:51.295
Okay.

41:07.413 --> 41:09.279
The boys get in the
edge of their destination,

41:09.281 --> 41:12.852
not knowing what
fate awaits them.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.190
Look, Ollie, it's El Dorado.

41:23.962 --> 41:27.900
Now this is what we call
in the industry a wild card,

41:29.368 --> 41:32.205
a group of characters the
audience wasn't expecting.

41:33.438 --> 41:36.940
Well within minutes of the
Jews Brothers entering town

41:36.942 --> 41:41.411
comes the sound of
Eduardo's Desert Tours,

41:41.413 --> 41:44.514
only this time his
coach breaks down

41:44.516 --> 41:49.188
with only one place to go other
than the desert, El Dorado.

41:52.491 --> 41:54.460
A huge mistake, Eduardo.

41:58.998 --> 42:00.067
Everybody off.

42:09.641 --> 42:11.308
What the hell is that?

42:11.310 --> 42:13.412
Do you think we made the
right decision coming here?

42:14.647 --> 42:16.549
There was no where
else to go, Stanley.

42:17.417 --> 42:18.518
Why are we stopping?

42:19.618 --> 42:21.985
The bus is broken down

42:21.987 --> 42:24.523
and there isn't another
stop for 300 miles.

42:26.192 --> 42:29.563
It's either here or the desert.

42:39.205 --> 42:40.040
Asshole.

42:45.578 --> 42:46.913
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:48.214 --> 42:52.152
today is the 200th anniversary
of our little town.

42:53.453 --> 42:57.257
So tonight we shall celebrate
at El Dorado's own music hall

42:58.123 --> 42:59.690
with our special guests,

42:59.692 --> 43:01.257
live from California,

43:01.259 --> 43:04.462
the Soggy Bottom Boys
and their tribute act.

43:04.464 --> 43:06.063
Is he talking about us?

43:06.065 --> 43:07.264
JJ's done it again.

43:07.266 --> 43:10.034
But we're the Jews Brothers.

43:10.036 --> 43:11.571
Not tonight, we're not.

43:12.572 --> 43:13.573
Hooray!

43:14.574 --> 43:16.706
Come one, come
all, and celebrate

43:16.708 --> 43:20.714
with the Soggy Bottom
Boys live at our Old Opry.

43:23.081 --> 43:26.217
Hiya cowboys, line up,
line up, and try you luck.

43:26.219 --> 43:28.052
Shoot a can if you can.

43:30.355 --> 43:33.056
Would you and your daughter
mind to have a try, Sir?

43:33.058 --> 43:35.761
That's my wife,
shorty, not my daughter.

43:36.828 --> 43:38.695
Cheeky little fucker.

43:38.697 --> 43:39.532
I'll show him.

43:49.741 --> 43:51.510
Well done, Daddy!

43:52.578 --> 43:53.580
Good shot, cowboy.

43:54.781 --> 43:57.016
Like I said, that's
what I call shooting.

44:00.152 --> 44:02.555
Been buying in El Dorado
for almost 200 years now.

44:03.723 --> 44:06.090
First settlers came to
this part of the desert

44:06.092 --> 44:09.563
to claim the gold, and
then they decided to stay.

44:10.830 --> 44:12.563
How can I help you, little lady?

44:12.565 --> 44:14.764
Is there still gold here?

44:14.766 --> 44:15.668
Good question.

44:17.136 --> 44:18.237
Some say no,

44:19.371 --> 44:21.137
but I believe that if
you wish hard enough

44:21.139 --> 44:23.340
your dreams could come
true at El Dorado.

44:23.342 --> 44:24.378
Fact!

44:25.578 --> 44:28.047
Some say El Dorado was
discovered by a pirate,

44:29.181 --> 44:30.648
a rogue of the sea.

44:32.250 --> 44:35.085
Captain Jake was his name.

44:35.087 --> 44:37.188
Hard drinking,
woman loving pirate

44:37.190 --> 44:39.190
that only cared for the sea.

44:39.192 --> 44:43.427
Like all stories, things didn't
go right for Captain Jake,

44:43.429 --> 44:45.365
and on a night very
similar to tonight,

44:46.331 --> 44:47.534
his ship hit a storm.

44:49.668 --> 44:51.437
He fought the waves!

44:52.538 --> 44:54.608
As his shipped
bobbed on the sea,

44:55.607 --> 44:57.474
like a matchstick on.

44:57.476 --> 44:59.712
Tell me, what
happened to this pirate?

45:01.147 --> 45:04.618
Well, Captain Jake fought
those waves to the bitter end.

45:05.650 --> 45:09.089
When out of the sea came
a monster from hell.

45:12.625 --> 45:14.525
The Kraken appeared.

45:14.527 --> 45:17.728
Some say it stood 1,000
feet, not an inch more.

45:17.730 --> 45:19.163
Well what did he do?

45:19.165 --> 45:20.396
Like
any good Captain,

45:20.398 --> 45:22.366
Captain Jake went
down with his ship

45:22.368 --> 45:25.768
as the Kraken curled,
dragging it under the sea,

45:25.770 --> 45:29.239
along with Davy Jones' locker.

45:29.241 --> 45:30.674
Did he die?

45:30.676 --> 45:31.844
Did the Kraken kill him?

45:33.346 --> 45:34.945
Well we're talking
about Captain Jake, here.

45:34.947 --> 45:37.715
A rogue of the sea, little lady.

45:37.717 --> 45:40.317
As Captain Jake watches
the awful scene,

45:40.319 --> 45:43.353
he knows his destiny
must travel another path.

45:43.355 --> 45:45.458
On that path Captain
Jake traveled.

46:13.853 --> 46:17.190
That's it, go west
yon man, go west.

46:18.857 --> 46:21.224
So what happened next?

46:21.226 --> 46:21.860
Arr!

46:23.529 --> 46:27.598
Now this part is interesting.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.435
Captain Jake walked
for many a moon,

46:30.603 --> 46:31.871
many a day through
the desert sun.

46:33.471 --> 46:35.941
Legend states that Captain
Jake stumbled on this spot

46:37.543 --> 46:40.380
and as his body melted
into the desert,

46:41.547 --> 46:44.918
became an oasis which
later became El Dorado.

46:46.819 --> 46:48.755
And that, little lady,

46:50.956 --> 46:52.826
is the legend of El Dorado.

46:58.331 --> 46:59.797
This ain't no
Blues Club, Ollie.

46:59.799 --> 47:00.800
What are we gonna do?

47:01.967 --> 47:03.833
Oh, what are we gonna do, Ollie?

47:03.835 --> 47:05.703
We ain't no bluegrass
tribute act.

47:05.705 --> 47:07.770
The only song I know is the one

47:07.772 --> 47:10.340
that Daddy used to sing
us when we were kids!

47:10.342 --> 47:12.242
That's a great idea, Stanley.

47:12.244 --> 47:13.844
- Let's do that one.
- What?

47:13.846 --> 47:15.346
Now our very own El Dorado boy

47:15.348 --> 47:20.353
who will be doing a tune
for all you good city folk.

47:20.953 --> 47:23.786
Come on, Tommy, come up.

47:28.627 --> 47:30.930
Bit short for Elvis, ain't he?

47:42.340 --> 47:43.873
I can't hear you.

47:55.788 --> 47:57.020
Bring on the Soggy Bottom Boys,

47:57.022 --> 47:58.257
not this crap.

48:00.558 --> 48:01.625
You can do anything, Tommy.

48:01.627 --> 48:03.761
You can just do anything to me.

48:09.467 --> 48:11.804
Elvis has left the building!

48:16.475 --> 48:18.308
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:18.310 --> 48:19.946
due to popular demand,

48:21.580 --> 48:24.447
we're gonna cut short our
Elvis appreciation tribute

48:24.449 --> 48:26.949
and go straight to the
main act of the evening.

48:26.951 --> 48:28.587
What are you doing?

48:30.723 --> 48:31.791
I have an idea.

48:32.891 --> 48:34.391
Oh, not another one.

48:34.393 --> 48:37.927
All the way form
southern California,

48:37.929 --> 48:42.666
theirs is a tribute act
to end all tribute acts.

48:42.668 --> 48:44.867
They may be from Las Vegas,

48:44.869 --> 48:48.605
but their hearts are
in the deep south.

48:48.607 --> 48:52.679
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Soggy Bottom Boys.

48:53.712 --> 48:55.545
Soggy Bottom Boys!

48:55.547 --> 48:57.348

49:59.677 --> 50:01.811
He's the butcher

50:01.813 --> 50:04.181
I need a mechanic,
not a butcher.

50:04.183 --> 50:06.516
It's Lemmas' Chop Shop.

50:06.518 --> 50:08.918

all the way from Las Vegas,
just for you good folk.

54:01.386 --> 54:02.154
Dick?

54:03.087 --> 54:04.855
Dick?

54:04.857 --> 54:05.692
Dick?

54:09.795 --> 54:14.801
Dick!

54:16.701 --> 54:19.469
Do you think I could
help her find her dick?

54:19.471 --> 54:21.103
We haven't got time, Stanley.

54:21.105 --> 54:23.040
Aw, but Ollie.

54:23.042 --> 54:27.143
You can't leave a young lady
wanting a dick, can you?

54:27.145 --> 54:28.210
Dick?

54:28.212 --> 54:29.081
Dick!

54:30.214 --> 54:31.715
What's the point
of having a Dick

54:31.717 --> 54:33.784
when you can't find him?

54:33.786 --> 54:35.421
He's never around
when you need him.

54:42.460 --> 54:43.328
11:58.

54:45.163 --> 54:46.165
She's gonna die.

54:47.232 --> 54:48.301
She's gonna die, Ted.

54:49.802 --> 54:52.405
Fast and hard, like
sperm hitting the condom.

54:53.806 --> 54:57.273
Well then, I'm
gonna go with you.

54:57.275 --> 54:58.875
There's no need.

54:58.877 --> 55:01.244
Two guns are better than one.

55:01.246 --> 55:02.978
You just wanna fuck my wife.

55:02.980 --> 55:04.213
Yes, I do.

55:19.931 --> 55:22.364
So Ollie, where
do we go from here?

55:22.366 --> 55:24.166
Yo Stanley, if
JJ's got anything

55:24.168 --> 55:25.737
to do with it, who knows?

55:30.942 --> 55:32.011
Ahh, Ollie!

55:33.011 --> 55:33.980
It's an ear!

55:42.353 --> 55:43.786
Back in El Dorado,

55:43.788 --> 55:47.456
Chef Mario gets ready
for the celebration.

55:47.458 --> 55:50.062
Bon appetite, city slickers.

55:51.295 --> 55:52.429
Trying to make a 40

55:52.431 --> 55:54.797
going for a four.

55:56.235 --> 55:57.236
So?

55:58.302 --> 56:00.070
What's cooking, Mario?

56:00.072 --> 56:03.440
My cuisine will be
fit for a king, Mayor.

56:03.442 --> 56:07.811
The meat will just
fall from the bone.

56:07.813 --> 56:09.945
That sounds good, Mario.

56:09.947 --> 56:12.282
We don't want them city
slickers finding out

56:12.284 --> 56:15.152
our little secret
before they need to.

56:15.154 --> 56:18.121
City gourmet.

56:18.123 --> 56:19.225
City gourmet.

56:29.902 --> 56:32.302
Ladies and gentlemen,

56:32.304 --> 56:36.873
Chef Mario brings to you
the bistro resistance

56:36.875 --> 56:39.308
in El Dorado cooking!

56:47.485 --> 56:48.518
Voila!

57:15.246 --> 57:17.380
Welcome to Boon's, city folk,

57:17.382 --> 57:19.049
home of the combo.

57:19.051 --> 57:21.985
You gentlemen want anything?

57:21.987 --> 57:24.920
Yeah, give me some black
coffee and cigarettes.

57:24.922 --> 57:27.991
- And some information.
- Information?

57:27.993 --> 57:30.893
Information can cost
you, city slickers.

57:30.895 --> 57:32.497
Tough guys from the big city.

57:34.433 --> 57:37.500
Has a woman in a yellow
Trans Am been through here?

57:37.502 --> 57:39.902
- Nope.
- You sure?

57:39.904 --> 57:44.340
Like I say, boss, no pussy
wagon has come this way.

57:44.342 --> 57:45.442
Pussy wagon?

57:45.444 --> 57:47.309
Now that's a strange
expression to use.

57:47.311 --> 57:49.012
Why did you say pussy wagon?

57:49.014 --> 57:50.246
What?

57:50.248 --> 57:51.915
Pussy wagon, why'd you say it?

57:51.917 --> 57:53.351
Yo, boss, I don't understand.

57:56.388 --> 57:59.021
Now say something
funny, laughing boy.

57:59.023 --> 58:01.925
Yo I don't understand, boss.

58:01.927 --> 58:03.525
Oh, you will.

58:03.527 --> 58:06.096
Like I say, no
one's come this way.

58:06.098 --> 58:07.529
Shut up and stop lying!

58:07.531 --> 58:08.465
Roy!

58:08.467 --> 58:10.400
What's going on?

58:10.402 --> 58:13.402
Now say, wrong
number tough guy.

58:13.404 --> 58:15.307
- What?
- Say it!

58:16.507 --> 58:18.108
Wrong number, tough guy.

58:18.110 --> 58:19.175
Roy, talk to me.

58:19.177 --> 58:22.177
Now say it and then laugh.

58:22.179 --> 58:23.313
Roy, talk to me!

58:23.315 --> 58:24.547
I'm not going crazy.

58:24.549 --> 58:26.650
Say it or I'll blow
your fucking brains out

58:26.652 --> 58:27.717
right here, right now.

58:27.719 --> 58:30.420
Wrong number tough guy!

58:30.422 --> 58:34.991
Now say it and mean
it without the stammer.

58:34.993 --> 58:37.460
Wrong number, tough guy.

58:38.462 --> 58:40.496
You bastard, I
knew it was you.

58:40.498 --> 58:41.730
What have you done
with my money?

58:41.732 --> 58:43.400
Roy, tell me the story!

58:43.402 --> 58:44.967
This is the little fucker

58:44.969 --> 58:47.203
who was on the other
end of the line.

58:47.205 --> 58:48.404
How else would he have known

58:48.406 --> 58:51.407
that she called her
Trans Am a pussy wagon?

58:51.409 --> 58:52.474
Yo money, boss?

58:52.476 --> 58:54.643
Yeah, you're listening now.

58:54.645 --> 58:58.213
Yeah, say you haven't seen
the silver case with my money

58:58.215 --> 59:00.349
before I shoot you
between the eyes.

59:00.351 --> 59:01.684
Money?

59:01.686 --> 59:03.453
Yeah, yeah, money.

59:03.455 --> 59:05.558
A million dollars
of my money, ah!

59:08.393 --> 59:09.228
Uh.

59:10.362 --> 59:12.061
So I'm the little
fucker am I, big boy?

59:15.600 --> 59:18.000
Both of you, raise your hands.

59:18.002 --> 59:21.273
I'm gonna take you out back
and show you my workshop.

59:24.509 --> 59:25.474
Where is she?

59:25.476 --> 59:27.110
Where is who, numb nuts?

59:27.112 --> 59:30.447
You answered the phone,
bitch in the Trans Am.

59:30.449 --> 59:32.148
Pussy wagon lady,

59:32.150 --> 59:34.351
she's gonna be taken care of

59:34.353 --> 59:37.520
just like you and your money.

59:37.522 --> 59:39.521
Your time's coming, freak.

59:39.523 --> 59:41.991
This could be the end of us.

59:41.993 --> 59:43.128
Not again.

59:50.235 --> 59:51.237
Hello, Mayor?

59:52.503 --> 59:54.206
Yeah, it's all sorted.

59:56.308 --> 59:57.540
Okay, Tommy.

59:57.542 --> 59:58.574
That's good, lad.

59:58.576 --> 01:00:00.312
That's real good.

01:00:01.513 --> 01:00:04.549
Just come back when
you clear out there.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:06.648
Yeah, okay.

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.219
I'll come right over.

01:00:10.654 --> 01:00:12.322
Are the men ready, Lemmas?

01:00:12.324 --> 01:00:13.456
Oh yeah.

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:14.556
Yep, they've already
started rounding up

01:00:14.558 --> 01:00:15.759
the coach passengers, Mayor.

01:00:15.761 --> 01:00:16.594
Good.

01:00:19.498 --> 01:00:21.130
For tonight the clown will rise

01:00:21.132 --> 01:00:23.435
and blood will flow in
the streets of El Dorado.

01:00:27.772 --> 01:00:30.407
It seems like someone's
been asking some questions

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:32.175
about the little?

01:00:32.177 --> 01:00:33.012
Who?

01:00:41.619 --> 01:00:42.619
I know him.

01:00:42.621 --> 01:00:44.056
Friend or foe?

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.357
Now it was a long time ago.

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:48.757
He might have forgotten
about me by now.

01:00:48.759 --> 01:00:50.393
Kill him anyway.

01:00:50.395 --> 01:00:52.462
Bring back the money
if you can find it.

01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:54.400
Meanwhile, we'll
carry on looking here.

01:00:55.567 --> 01:00:56.369

Too long.

01:01:56.127 --> 01:01:58.263
Too many questions,
not enough answers.

01:01:59.397 --> 01:02:00.299
There never were.

01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:05.136
'Nam was like that.

01:02:09.741 --> 01:02:10.676
You want a drink?

01:02:16.614 --> 01:02:18.216
I've come here to kill you.

01:02:22.654 --> 01:02:24.322
Hell, I know that.

01:02:27.424 --> 01:02:28.526
You wanna get ready?

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:33.364
Yep.

01:02:37.735 --> 01:02:39.237
You got
your timepiece?

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.639
Ah, you wanna time this?

01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:46.846
- Why not?
- Yeah.

01:02:55.819 --> 01:02:58.387
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

01:02:58.389 --> 01:02:59.257
Oh, yes it was.

01:03:02.194 --> 01:03:03.395
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:05.862
300 men go into battle,

01:03:05.864 --> 01:03:08.300
- only two came out alive.
- I remember.

01:03:09.266 --> 01:03:11.400
Death stamped our passport,

01:03:11.402 --> 01:03:13.335
body bags were ordered.

01:03:13.337 --> 01:03:14.606
We weren't meant to live.

01:03:16.373 --> 01:03:18.308
Only God makes those choices.

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:20.009
Religion is for
the weak minded,

01:03:20.011 --> 01:03:21.844
men who have nothing
else to live for.

01:03:21.846 --> 01:03:22.947
Then what do we got?

01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:27.785
Death.

01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:34.293
Time check.

01:03:45.636 --> 01:03:50.208
11:58 and 20 seconds.

01:04:13.331 --> 01:04:14.963
You found anything?

01:04:14.965 --> 01:04:16.699
I've
ripped the car apart,

01:04:16.701 --> 01:04:18.737
but I can't find
anything, Mayor.

01:04:30.614 --> 01:04:32.614
The bitch hid the
money somewhere.

01:04:32.616 --> 01:04:35.317
Maybe she hid it
in the desert, Mayor?

01:04:35.319 --> 01:04:36.953
Maybe, or maybe
she did give it

01:04:36.955 --> 01:04:39.725
to the dentist for safekeeping?

01:04:51.402 --> 01:04:54.939
Citizens of El Dorado,
it's time to dance.

01:05:08.786 --> 01:05:11.788
Back at Lemmas'
slaughter house,

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:15.326
Tommy cleans up what
is left of Jessica

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.031
before he takes
care of our heroes.

01:05:20.565 --> 01:05:25.070
Oh dear, Jessica has got
herself into a frightful mess.

01:05:28.873 --> 01:05:29.806
Am I dreaming?

01:05:31.543 --> 01:05:32.942
Depends.

01:05:32.944 --> 01:05:34.844
On what, fat boy?

01:05:34.846 --> 01:05:36.878
If you're having
my type of dreams.

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:42.888
You know my daddy always wanted
me to go to cookery school?

01:05:44.054 --> 01:05:45.788
But what do I want
with gourmet cooking

01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:48.527
when I could have
food like this?

01:05:50.362 --> 01:05:53.061
Do you know where
this came from?

01:05:53.063 --> 01:05:55.797
Some rich bitch
with a smooth pussy

01:05:55.799 --> 01:05:59.037
that used to sit her ass
on a yellow Trans Am.

01:06:01.406 --> 01:06:03.373
She's a Barbie doll!

01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:05.511
I know 'cause I found her.

01:06:09.813 --> 01:06:11.780
Well, Soggy Bottom Boys,

01:06:11.782 --> 01:06:13.516
it looks like it's your time

01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:15.851
'cause the whole town
needs sandwiches.

01:06:33.804 --> 01:06:35.904
Now ain't that a bit of luck?

01:06:35.906 --> 01:06:37.909
Not a gunslinger in sight.

01:06:39.476 --> 01:06:43.549
Maybe Oliver and Stanley will
finally escape El Dorado.

01:06:44.949 --> 01:06:47.953
Whoop, on the other hand.

01:06:58.096 --> 01:07:00.862
Mayor, the Soggy
Bottom Boys are escaping!

01:07:00.864 --> 01:07:01.998
Escaping?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.166
Goddammit, I want them dead.

01:07:04.168 --> 01:07:06.501
Real dead.

01:07:06.503 --> 01:07:11.509
We gotta go kill these
sons of bitches, now.

01:07:27.859 --> 01:07:31.494
Now this is what
we call a finale.

01:07:31.496 --> 01:07:33.795
Riveting, isn't it?

01:08:08.967 --> 01:08:11.032
Don't even think
about it, Stanley.

01:08:11.034 --> 01:08:12.804
Well, it's another fine mess.

01:08:15.572 --> 01:08:16.872
- Break!
- What?

01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:18.741
I said break!

01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:20.611
Ollie look, it's the Mayor.

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:40.232
Look,
Stanley, it's the car.

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:48.970
So Ollie, where's
the next gig?

01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:52.042
- I better phone JJ.
- Ah, yeah.

01:09:11.728 --> 01:09:13.362
So what the hell you
got there, Stanley?

01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:15.765
Well you know that Trans Am

01:09:15.767 --> 01:09:18.768
at the back of the
diner near the washroom?

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.037
- Yeah?
- Well in there,

01:09:20.971 --> 01:09:22.707
do you want me to take it back?

01:12:32.929 --> 01:12:35.333
What's so wrong with my food?

01:12:36.299 --> 01:12:38.003
What's wrong with my food?

01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:40.304
Did I add too many spices?

01:12:42.572 --> 01:12:44.405
I don't know.

01:12:44.407 --> 01:12:46.111
I want to be a chef.

01:12:49.179 --> 01:12:50.182
Aye!

01:12:55.152 --> 01:12:57.418
What's wrong with my cooking?

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.320
What's wrong with my cooking?

01:12:59.322 --> 01:13:02.293
Please, God, tell me,
what am I doing so wrong?

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:10.035
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is the end.

01:13:13.507 --> 01:13:14.898
