20:16.015 --> 20:18.549
There were so many deaths.

several hundred lives lost

makes a lot of sense.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.502
There was an entire riot

20:38.504 --> 20:41.171
where three African-American men
were killed.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.907
What?
Yeah.

20:42.909 --> 20:47.578
All because there was a rumor
that a black man

20:47.580 --> 20:50.181
was going
to have a position

20:50.183 --> 20:53.717
where he was going
to manage white men.

20:53.719 --> 20:57.255

the white men beat up

20:57.257 --> 21:00.057
the African-American worker,
Charles Lee,

21:00.059 --> 21:03.060
and then the black workers
decided

21:03.062 --> 21:04.462
they were gonna
seek revenge

21:04.464 --> 21:07.198
and started fighting
with the whites.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.933
Right.
And then, eventually,
it escalated into this

21:09.935 --> 21:14.939
full-on race riot
at the dam in Gunter Camp

21:14.941 --> 21:17.742

workers actually lived.

Gunter Work Camp was located.

So what is it that you're
gonna do, exactly?

41:11.603 --> 41:14.204
RONNIE: We're gonna give
a prayer of thanks,

41:14.206 --> 41:16.739
and then we're gonna leave
an offering for the ancestors

41:16.741 --> 41:18.541
and the protectors here.
Okay.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.543
It's like a medicine wheel
with the circle

41:20.545 --> 41:23.413
because everything is
in a circle for Native people.

41:23.415 --> 41:26.549
And it's sage, cedar,
and sweet grass.

41:26.551 --> 41:27.950
-Okay.
-Okay.

41:27.952 --> 41:31.754
Grandfather, creator,
the two-legged, four-legged,

41:31.756 --> 41:33.623
the winged ones,
the plant people,

41:33.625 --> 41:36.025
the rock people,
and the water people.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.828
We only come to you
and ask for your protection

41:38.830 --> 41:41.030
as we leave here.

41:41.032 --> 41:45.968
We came in a good way,
taking only answers and memories

41:45.970 --> 41:48.571
and leaving only footsteps.

41:48.573 --> 41:52.241
For our ancestors
and the protectors here,

41:52.243 --> 41:55.645
oh, great one,
we leave these offerings.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.514
So this is just like a gift
that we're leaving.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.049
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you, Ronnie.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.117
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.852
Appreciate you, brother.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.855
BERRY:
The spirit of the workers who
never left Hales Bar appreciate

42:05.857 --> 42:09.325
Jeff respecting the buildings
they worked so hard to build.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.728
Even though he's still
experiencing activity,

42:11.730 --> 42:14.664
he won't have to worry about
anything negative from them.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.932
The ceremonial offering
appeased the Cherokee,

42:16.934 --> 42:19.736
and Jeff should feel safe
bringing people back in here

42:19.738 --> 42:22.004
and running his tour business.

42:22.006 --> 42:24.407
But Jeff has to continue to show
respect for the Cherokee

42:24.409 --> 42:27.210
and make sure visitors
don't violate this land

42:27.212 --> 42:28.611
and invoke their wrath,

42:28.613 --> 42:30.246
or the violent attacks
could return.
