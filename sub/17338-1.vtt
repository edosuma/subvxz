He is alone. He does not have anyone.

05:15.034 --> 05:17.868
Hell cow!

05:19.830 --> 05:23.039
He has lived on the street for a few days.

05:23.499 --> 05:28.870
He is safer there than Albion Court.

05:29.339 --> 05:34.551
Pushers are not safe there, let alone a child.

Fucking apartment squatters. They are rats everywhere.

07:06.851 --> 07:12.347
- I'm not a pest control operator. - Two power houses brat.

07:12.773 --> 07:17.814
Elevator works really miserable, and the 25th floor of one of the stench.

07:18.237 --> 07:22.106
After all, on the 25th floor may be anyone.

07:22.575 --> 07:28.071
What is being done to those young people? Place like some brothel.

07:28.539 --> 07:34.206
No screen did not see anything. My house is like some whoop it up.

07:34.669 --> 07:38.538
Your house? -I Have lived here for 20 years and worked.

07:52.520 --> 07:58.517
- Is that all? - Do you want a guided tour?

08:25.469 --> 08:29.179
Do you buy the grass?

08:44.947 --> 08:47.735
Are you moving you here?

08:48.200 --> 08:51.193
- Are you going to cause problems? - I do not.

08:51.662 --> 08:56.703
Otherwise you will have to deal with me. I'm in charge here.

08:57.167 --> 09:03.834
Did not the police have anything to say about that? - It's the cops interested.

09:04.298 --> 09:09.009
They do not care about you one bit and this place.

09:09.470 --> 09:16.138
- Who are you? - I Carnacki, caretaker.

09:16.602 --> 09:20.266
If you have a problem, not approached me.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.854

I understand.

09:51.219 --> 09:55.634
- I'm sorry, this will not last long. - No hurry.

09:56.433 --> 10:01.053

- What kind of murder-housing? - He just wanted to scare.

10:31.217 --> 10:34.801
They're dead in the apartment.

11:17.804 --> 11:23.300
Is anybody home? This looks similar to mine.

11:23.768 --> 11:26.511
- Hi, I'm Kate. Have you changed the counter? - Yeah.

11:26.980 --> 11:31.566
Is this your first apartment? It is probably, you look like 12-year-old.

11:31.985 --> 11:36.446
- Too young to live alone, do not you? - There was no choice.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.572
My mother made me mad.

11:40.034 --> 11:42.868
Living my first year with a caravan of Irish tramps.

11:43.288 --> 11:49.580
It was a wild time. Fruit basket! You're welcome.

11:50.086 --> 11:54.421
- Mother threw me on the street. - It was probably miserable.

11:54.882 --> 11:58.124
Yeah, but it was even a good. This seems like a good place.

11:58.593 --> 12:03.304
- Is this a good place? - There is at least in your own place.

12:03.765 --> 12:09.682
Burn a bit of amber here. It gives positive energy.

12:10.147 --> 12:14.812
- Why do I need the positive energy? - We all need it.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.103
Here you can be evil spirits.

12:18.530 --> 12:24.447
I am sensitive to such. It makes my boyfriend crazy.

12:24.911 --> 12:30.327
- Is this house ghosts? - All houses have.

12:30.792 --> 12:35.207
- Who is this? - My father.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.131
Nice. Friendly eyes. Do you see him often?

12:39.593 --> 12:42.630
- I do not. He is dead. - That's bad luck for you.

12:43.095 --> 12:47.886
- Rose Quartz helps to grief. - Help to those things?

A nice telly! Where did you get it? - It was right there. - Does it work?

13:17.171 --> 13:20.505
Now I think to show. I thought only.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.130
- It'll just have to tune in. - At least it works.

13:25.595 --> 13:30.306
I organize a party on Saturday. You are welcome.

13:30.767 --> 13:33.851
I can not. -Come on. Telly you were looking?

You could keroa everything about yourself. Here is the thin walls. All belongs.

13:40.985 --> 13:46.697
- Just like being in the same room. - Kate?

13:47.117 --> 13:51.532
- Nothing. - Is it for sure?

13:53.081 --> 13:58.247
Murder apartment? Welcome home.

14:08.387 --> 14:12.256
Let's start by marching on the spot.

14:12.724 --> 14:16.843
Remember energy. Wide smile. Great.

14:17.312 --> 14:24.276
This is after you are skinny. Now your hands.

14:57.602 --> 15:02.313
What's the matter there is a fitted sheet? Go out, if you do not know how to be.

15:02.773 --> 15:07.689
After all, you already used two courses. Does he try to kill you?

15:08.112 --> 15:12.482
It's filthy pervert wants to guess gives private lessons.

15:12.909 --> 15:18.121
- Come on. - Can you imagine?

15:18.581 --> 15:25.044
- I would die even if you prefer. Excuse me. - It is okay.

15:25.505 --> 15:31.422
- I should not have to say so. - Really, it's nothing.

15:32.762 --> 15:37.051
Inexpensive gunk.

16:11.258 --> 16:14.672
What now?

16:17.264 --> 16:20.347
Creator!

16:20.808 --> 16:26.679
Do not stop! I can not stand the annoying thing tonight.

16:27.690 --> 16:32.526
What are you doing? Oh, hello.

16:35.531 --> 16:39.741
- Let's do it praying thing. - Will you do as I say?

16:43.581 --> 16:47.575
- What's my name? - You naughty officer.

16:50.546 --> 16:55.086
- Are you having fun? - Do you hear that sound of a neighbor?

16:55.551 --> 17:01.172
Fussy even if the clock is only half eleven. All will hear it.

17:01.640 --> 17:06.634
So, when pressed against the wall of the glass.

17:07.103 --> 17:10.311
It's disgusting.

17:15.444 --> 17:18.358
Do not be afraid, they are soaked in coconut oil.

17:18.781 --> 17:21.944
It will help you to release your emotions.

17:32.420 --> 17:36.289
That's not normal.

17:37.008 --> 17:41.343
I do not believe it.

17:42.430 --> 17:47.094
The entire floor is dark.

17:48.435 --> 17:55.308
- I can not believe they are still in the job. - So, the telly did not work.

18:01.031 --> 18:04.524
What are you doing? Call the housing company.

18:04.951 --> 18:12.324
Must live in the dark month? Fuse it only has tripped.

18:12.793 --> 18:18.664
If once you say so, expert. I'm going to get some candles.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.551
Glad that this is someone's opinion a lot of fun.

19:41.337 --> 19:43.579
Finally.

19:44.048 --> 19:46.631
Smart type.

20:14.912 --> 20:19.373
Michael, what have you done?

20:26.173 --> 20:28.586
Yes, it is a crazy house.

20:31.261 --> 20:35.301
Yeah, baby! Just like that!

21:29.442 --> 21:32.185
What the hell?

21:34.447 --> 21:38.282
What are you doing?

21:39.953 --> 21:44.038
- Are you going to the city? - No, at that close only.

21:44.457 --> 21:50.169
I am looking for ukkoani. He went to the top floor to replace the fuses.

21:50.630 --> 21:54.123
The top floor?

22:08.647 --> 22:11.139
Mark!

22:11.692 --> 22:14.605
Mark!

22:16.447 --> 22:20.612
Call an ambulance!

22:33.339 --> 22:37.458
I jumped over the railing and punched it a bigger corner.

22:37.927 --> 22:43.514
- Really? - Yeah. I should not have done it.

22:43.974 --> 22:48.184
The man began to kick and scream.

22:48.646 --> 22:53.811
Like a cornered animal.

22:54.275 --> 23:01.148
- You're a nimble man, Carnacki. - This house must exercise.

23:01.616 --> 23:07.487
They were junkies. Not enough to have the condition. It is because of the drugs.

23:07.914 --> 23:11.078
Did you call the cops? Why are they not arrested?

23:11.501 --> 23:16.872
They were half as much. It was a big cornered and small ...

23:17.340 --> 23:21.630
Small? -But Peppery. You know those guys.

23:22.095 --> 23:26.089
- Yes I know. - She was attacked from behind.

23:26.557 --> 23:33.020
- Then they ran. - How it relates to this?

23:33.481 --> 23:37.440
Not directly in any way, but I need help to treat the house.

23:37.901 --> 23:42.862
They interfere with all the time and I do not have time to take care of my job.

23:43.323 --> 23:48.034
Is your work to warm pizzas and droop in the chair?

23:48.453 --> 23:54.165
- That's not fair. - Life is not fair.

23:56.336 --> 23:57.747
Prick.

23:57.754 --> 24:03.500
- Was Landis already dead? - It was.

24:03.969 --> 24:08.259
And Mrs. Landis was with Miss McColl?

24:08.724 --> 24:11.387
- Sarah. - Yeah, he was with her.

24:11.852 --> 24:16.597
- I do then is responsible for this. - Good evening, sir.

24:17.065 --> 24:21.934
Good evening, I'm Thomas Wyngarde, superintendent.

24:22.403 --> 24:26.647
- I'm the caretaker. - Nice to meet you.

24:31.287 --> 24:33.995
Thank you.

24:37.752 --> 24:42.338
- Hey. - I think he was killed.

24:43.549 --> 24:47.668
Not nice, but they did not say that the house is a serial killer.

24:48.179 --> 24:51.468
The division serial killer? Would not the bodies should be more?

24:51.932 --> 24:56.802
One is found. He was found, therefore, that the lift was out of order.

24:57.271 --> 25:02.687
- The body could have been there for a long time. - Corpses must be at least three.

25:03.151 --> 25:07.942
- Do not forget those young people. - I do not want to hear about it.

25:08.406 --> 25:12.776
They're dead in your apartment. They just lived there.

25:13.244 --> 25:18.785
It was the kind of Romeo and Juliet thing. And now Michael.

25:19.209 --> 25:22.373
That makes three.

25:22.796 --> 25:26.631
Corpses can not be everywhere. There are a lot of empty homes.

25:27.092 --> 25:30.836
- That is just changed, and I do not produce the feeling. - He is my friend.

25:31.304 --> 25:36.766
Miss McCol? Thanks for help. I would like to ask a few questions.

25:37.769 --> 25:44.391
- Eliko Mr. Landis when you saw him? - I do not know. He did not move.

25:44.859 --> 25:51.731
- Did you see anything suspicious? - Two friends hung out here.

25:52.199 --> 25:55.363
- Those damn apartment squatters. - In the main suspect.

25:55.828 --> 26:02.166
- Here sneaks always a bunch of people. - I do not think that they are murderers.

26:02.584 --> 26:06.999
- It does not have to be a murder. - Junkie, Constable.

26:07.422 --> 26:11.291
- Inspector. - Junkie looking for peaks.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.548
God knows what those will come up.

28:12.169 --> 28:15.003
Happy Birthday.

28:57.130 --> 29:01.215
- What the hell are you doing here? - I'm just getting my things and leave.

29:01.676 --> 29:05.761
The keys here.

29:09.142 --> 29:13.182
Break through that way to my house, bitch.

29:13.646 --> 29:18.186
You cost me a lot of money.

29:18.651 --> 29:21.644
I left your father for your sake.

29:22.113 --> 29:25.480
It is not my reason, that the father died.

29:26.742 --> 29:30.531
Now you can get to cope on their own, you lazy tart.

29:38.628 --> 29:41.587
- What is that shit? - They are my things.

29:42.007 --> 29:45.466
Everything in this house is mine.

29:45.927 --> 29:49.466
They can certainly buy from me.

29:49.931 --> 29:53.891
- 40 pounds. - I do not have.

29:54.353 --> 29:59.644
How much do you have?

30:01.568 --> 30:04.982
25...

30:08.450 --> 30:13.786
- It is not enough at all. - Mother, please do not.

30:20.211 --> 30:24.797
Get lost.

31:12.971 --> 31:16.681
Sarah.

31:25.024 --> 31:28.358
Joo.

31:37.411 --> 31:40.370
Sarah.

31:45.711 --> 31:49.045
Hey! Stay there.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.635
What are you doing?

31:56.096 --> 32:01.933
These homes are unoccupied. Not here may be.

32:02.394 --> 32:06.513
I have not done anything.

32:07.107 --> 32:14.150
Be careful. This house is not good.

32:15.657 --> 32:22.950
Go now. Stay away from the top floor.

33:21.471 --> 33:24.305
- Take it easy! - I do not steal!

33:24.766 --> 33:28.510
- What's wrong with you? - Murtauduitte my apartment!

33:28.979 --> 33:34.771
- This is a misunderstanding. - He hit a frying pan!

33:35.235 --> 33:43.109
We thought the apartments empty. We're leaving now.

33:44.411 --> 33:47.494
What the hell? You had to cut off my hand.

33:47.955 --> 33:51.869
- We apologize. - Put them back.

33:52.334 --> 33:55.827
- Is not nothing worth stealing? - Put them back now.

33:56.255 --> 33:59.544
Back? Elbow sökönä.

33:59.967 --> 34:07.010
You tease. This is credited.

34:08.434 --> 34:13.429
He is the son of a bitch. I promise that I will try to get them back to you.

34:30.788 --> 34:34.657
What's wrong with you? Why did you take the girl to the goods?

34:35.126 --> 34:38.915
What you need from the hair straightener, trowel and a banana?

34:39.380 --> 34:44.125
I took them because she is a slut shit. For some goddamn reason -

34:44.552 --> 34:50.264
he shoots frying pan. Satan! Good I did not show him.

34:50.725 --> 34:54.844
- Give me them now. - Hell no.

34:55.313 --> 34:59.023
Got you!

36:37.079 --> 36:39.662
Huhuu?

36:40.499 --> 36:46.210
I am a friend. Do not hit the frying pan.

37:01.019 --> 37:04.763
Is someone there?

37:10.987 --> 37:15.982
Get!

37:20.705 --> 37:23.322
Hei, Paul.

37:23.792 --> 37:28.456

37:30.547 --> 37:35.417
I do not want you to vicious new heroine.

37:37.971 --> 37:42.762
Stop, goddamn it!

37:46.146 --> 37:49.639
He has been difficult. the only light in his life is dead.

37:50.108 --> 37:53.101
He deserves our compassion.

37:53.570 --> 37:57.189
Can someone help?

37:57.658 --> 38:03.950
You, Paul, you do not have to show any emotions.

38:04.414 --> 38:11.377
You run the hallways, narkkaat murjuissa and stealing ...

38:13.172 --> 38:20.761
What other dark secrets in your head is?

38:24.851 --> 38:28.185
I'm sorry, but you have to experience transformation.

38:28.646 --> 38:32.606
We do not need junkies stealing.

38:44.203 --> 38:48.698
- Am I doing it, Paul? - Do not, do not!

39:20.697 --> 39:23.815
Wake up.

39:49.975 --> 39:53.343
- I would have thought you calf. - You scared me.

39:53.812 --> 39:58.182
We are looking for just sleeping. We did not mean evil.

39:58.651 --> 40:03.191
I choose and I do not beg for anything.

40:03.656 --> 40:09.573
But it is not easy to be homeless and trying to find food. Really.

40:10.037 --> 40:14.407
I just want that I'm treated well.

40:14.875 --> 40:21.587
- What are you talking about? - You hälytit cops here.

40:22.048 --> 40:27.419
I am not alarmed. Why should I explain my actions to you?

40:27.845 --> 40:32.465
- You broke into my apartment. - It was a misunderstanding.

40:32.892 --> 40:37.011
Whatever. You broke into my apartment.

40:37.480 --> 40:41.520
- And I called the cops. - Where then is my friend?

40:41.985 --> 40:45.194
Am I your secretary?

40:45.655 --> 40:49.399
It may be that I have misunderstood.

40:49.867 --> 40:55.079
Carnacki not would call the police. That's why I thought it was you.

40:55.540 --> 41:02.288
- You thought you were in an apartment empty. - I thought so.

41:02.755 --> 41:08.341
The police are looking for us. It wants to talk about the dead guy.

41:08.802 --> 41:11.840
If we find we're screwed.

41:12.264 --> 41:18.727
- Why? You killed him yourselves? - You do not have the noble perception of me.

41:19.187 --> 41:26.606
No, when you take into account followed and what kind of life you spend.

41:29.031 --> 41:31.819
Excuse me.

41:32.284 --> 41:34.321
Damn.

41:34.786 --> 41:40.953
And it would be great if you think about it, but ...

41:41.418 --> 41:47.880
- I did not mean it. I am sorry. - Really. then Will you do me a favor?

41:48.340 --> 41:55.804
- I'm so sorry not. - Small only. Just the heart of the concerns.

41:56.223 --> 42:00.342
- Alright. - Care to join the institution?

42:00.770 --> 42:05.105
- See if my friends there. - OK.

42:05.566 --> 42:09.310
Then let's go.

42:11.030 --> 42:15.900
Not Albion Cour pretty bad not. After all the problems, but ...

42:16.368 --> 42:22.706
There is pretty cool, but Carnacki is a prick type.

42:23.167 --> 42:25.784
Why? - He is -

42:26.253 --> 42:32.214
like Darth Vader or Skywalker Borg Picard.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.634
- You sound like my father. - Is he a sci-fi fan?

42:36.096 --> 42:43.185
It was. Carnackin hommiinhan a drive occupiers out.

42:43.603 --> 42:48.439
His hommiinsa a clean up and take care of debris.

42:48.900 --> 42:53.440
It is like a personal vendetta. And Wyngarde ...

42:53.905 --> 42:56.443
- Is he the same? - Worse.

42:56.908 --> 43:03.997
with Carnackin can not talk, but Wyngarde's a real prick.

43:04.582 --> 43:12.046
I must say some. You do not sound like who was born here.

43:12.507 --> 43:18.878
I was born here, then we moved to US for a few years.

43:19.346 --> 43:25.138
- There came a little difficulty. - Chesapeakes? Do not try.

43:25.561 --> 43:29.771
To the extent that came from deportation. And here we are now.

43:30.232 --> 43:33.771
- I have come back. - Without relatives?

43:34.236 --> 43:40.733
I have an aunt in Wyoming. We do not like us.

43:41.201 --> 43:48.699
- Are you from around here? - Mom and Dad moved up here.

43:49.293 --> 43:54.038
- We're here. Remember now that ... - I know. I did not see you.

43:54.506 --> 43:59.216
You are in convenient packaging. I look forward to this.

44:14.483 --> 44:18.727
- Was Paul there? - They do not know anything about him.

44:19.197 --> 44:25.694
I'm going to explore a couple of places where he hangs out. See you soon.

45:00.111 --> 45:02.353
What are you doing here?

45:02.822 --> 45:08.989
Should there be a reason to come and meet daughters? You keep the door locked.

45:09.454 --> 45:14.950
- Where is the tea kettle? - Sulphur.

45:18.338 --> 45:23.003
You never know when you needed a lighter.

45:26.929 --> 45:33.267
- How did you know where I live? - A mother has a right to know.

45:33.686 --> 45:36.645
I followed you.

45:37.064 --> 45:43.857
- The caretaker said where you live. - That was friendly.

45:46.782 --> 45:50.446
Are you at work?

45:50.911 --> 45:54.279
- Is that really you pay the rent? - Yeah.

45:54.748 --> 45:57.866
- Is it a good job? - Yes.

45:58.335 --> 46:01.578
Good salary that is enough. I can not give you anything.

46:02.047 --> 46:06.792
Me? What are you talking about?

46:07.261 --> 46:11.095
I just wanted to see how you can.

46:11.556 --> 46:16.017
Hang in mourning.

46:16.769 --> 46:21.480
- Perhaps we could agree on something. - What?

46:21.899 --> 46:26.189
Even if you do not tarry abroad no longer with me, you do not have to forget me completely.

46:26.654 --> 46:30.898
After all, you threw me out. It was just a tip of the iceberg.

46:31.367 --> 46:35.407
Mother will never cease to be a mother. It is elinkautistuomio.

46:35.872 --> 46:40.333
It started 18 years ago, and it is not the devil takes over yet.

46:40.793 --> 46:45.333
Feeding, clothing ...

46:45.798 --> 46:52.841
I wiped your ass. It is care. I paid for everything you need.

46:54.139 --> 46:59.225
- You owe me. - I owe you not.

47:00.479 --> 47:04.849
- Dad gave it to me. - It's mine now.

47:05.275 --> 47:09.360
Enter the lighter back!

47:11.573 --> 47:19.367
Out of my apartment! Contact romusi and beat it once and for all!

47:21.291 --> 47:28.334
I have made you what you are today. You would get to thank me.

47:28.799 --> 47:32.713
- For what may I thank you? - If your father loved you so ...

47:33.178 --> 47:40.516
- Why he left without taking you with me? - You nasty bitch!

47:40.935 --> 47:46.397
El means nothing to me! You're just a drunk bitch!

47:46.816 --> 47:53.529
Such as you should be sterilized! Let me be!

48:00.955 --> 48:03.698
You're just a drunk bitch!

48:04.166 --> 48:08.206
I guess the villain is found.

48:17.680 --> 48:24.893
- I'm just here. - I know who you are Satan, Lucy!

48:25.728 --> 48:29.187
Excuse me. -It is okay. That's why I came in.

48:29.607 --> 48:33.692
- Sarah, you all right? - I do not.

48:34.154 --> 48:38.819
- What did he want? - He got me into force badly.

48:39.284 --> 48:44.279
- I whack him. - It's about time.

48:52.672 --> 48:57.542
Is that your father's lighter? At least you got back to it.

48:58.011 --> 49:04.428
- Look now. - Oh, shit. Yes, it is miserable.

49:04.892 --> 49:10.433
It was the only memory of my father, and now she broke even.

49:11.231 --> 49:14.395
Huhuu! I here only.

49:14.818 --> 49:18.812
I heard that here kinasteltiin. Tell me everything.

49:19.281 --> 49:22.615
- Can I help? - Yeah, milk and two lumps of sugar.

49:23.076 --> 49:29.994
I'm sorry that räyhäsimme. -Paha Feeling is not good karma.

49:30.459 --> 49:34.248
Is this not what makes?

49:34.713 --> 49:39.925
Go buy chocolate cookies.

49:40.385 --> 49:44.129
I heard the cry of four on the floor below. There you lungs.

49:44.598 --> 49:48.511
Is Paul found? No, he was frightened. I do not know where he is.

49:48.976 --> 49:54.893
But I found this ... and ...

49:55.566 --> 49:59.230
- They're not mine. - Who is that guy?

49:59.654 --> 50:04.774
Murovaras. He and his friends broke into my apartment last night.

50:05.243 --> 50:09.704
It took a second direct my hair. He was not even arrested.

50:10.164 --> 50:14.033
- Soila police. - Asia has already made clear.

50:14.502 --> 50:19.748
We just wanted a place where to sleep. We're friends now.

50:20.216 --> 50:22.959
Take the children and a banana and ...

50:23.427 --> 50:28.172
- This is like the twilight zone. - It's a good series.

50:28.641 --> 50:33.180
This house is like the twilight zone or the devil's tower.

50:33.645 --> 50:40.518
I will go now. Then come and join the party later.

50:54.249 --> 51:01.247
- How long have you lived here? - About a year.

51:01.715 --> 51:08.178
Have you seen the murder in addition to any other strange here?

51:36.206 --> 51:40.667
Help!

52:03.441 --> 52:10.405
- I have seen some strange things. - You're just tired and confused.

52:10.865 --> 52:16.452
- Not many people have not seen the dead. - I'm not thinking about it.

52:16.913 --> 52:22.250
Thus on TV something very terrible in the morning. I can not explain it.

52:22.710 --> 52:28.126
- I've also horror movies viewed. - No, it was Paul.

52:28.591 --> 52:32.175
The face just in the blood, and he stared at me.

52:32.637 --> 52:36.756
No, it was not a program. It was real.

52:37.225 --> 52:42.220
When we come here, it's from that old lady was taken for treatment.

52:42.688 --> 52:46.398
So? -He Said that the telly talking to him.

52:46.817 --> 52:51.152
- We need to find Paul. - No, we need to calm down.

52:51.571 --> 52:55.906
- The day has been tough for you. - Sid, you're crazy.

52:56.368 --> 53:01.864
Just a little. I'm going to look for him. He is on the roof or on the top floor.

53:02.332 --> 53:05.370
- Carnacki will not consider them homes. - Then let's go.

53:05.836 --> 53:11.924
- I'm bilekuteissa! - Wait here. We will be back soon.

53:12.384 --> 53:16.003
Have fun with this.

53:16.763 --> 53:18.755
I told you so?

53:19.224 --> 53:21.841
Just looking limes.

53:22.310 --> 53:26.394
Not worth it. Do not accelerate.

53:28.149 --> 53:31.187
Take some chips if you're hungry.

53:31.610 --> 53:35.149
Excuse me!

53:36.157 --> 53:39.992
This is my bedroom. Could you ...

53:54.091 --> 54:01.055
How long have you been living like this? -Some time. This should all live.

54:01.515 --> 54:07.557
- You get used to it. - The two who died on the roof ...

54:08.022 --> 54:13.233
- Did you feel them? - I saw them once in a while.

54:13.651 --> 54:19.192
It was a suicide thing, is not it? - Such was rumored. - Do you believe it?

54:19.616 --> 54:24.907
Whenever I saw them, they were just lääpällään each other.

54:25.371 --> 54:29.832
It was said that they face due to the sucking died of asphyxia -

54:30.293 --> 54:34.788
and that all the holes were blocked. I believe it, but ...

54:35.256 --> 54:39.375
In this place there is something very strange. Fatalities, ceiling ...

54:39.844 --> 54:43.508
Michael died repaired electrical fault.

54:43.973 --> 54:48.434
Something here is badly skewed.

54:48.895 --> 54:51.933
What are you doing?

54:56.318 --> 55:00.437
- I did not it was not me. I do not know ... - Do not put the fight back.

55:01.031 --> 55:04.115
Do as they say.

55:20.175 --> 55:23.293
What just happened?

55:23.762 --> 55:29.633
- I do not know. - Do not come close!

55:40.611 --> 55:45.606
- What are you watching? - UFO. Have you seen it?

55:46.033 --> 55:47.865
It's a darn good.

55:48.244 --> 55:51.954
- Do you like prätkistä also? - What?

55:52.415 --> 55:55.328
- You got leather clothes. - I can not hear.

55:55.793 --> 56:00.083
- Tell me I'm beautiful. - You are both wonderful.

56:00.548 --> 56:04.292
- Shut, Mark. - Pull the hair.

56:05.052 --> 56:08.545
Say I'm naughty.

56:09.015 --> 56:13.680
- Get out! You will stain you lakanani. - Do not you want a taste of this, baby?

56:14.145 --> 56:20.642
- Do not go away when I'm talking to you! - Your friend marries our bed.

56:21.109 --> 56:26.525
- Where are you put them? - Do not let your friend be here.

56:26.948 --> 56:29.656
Take it easy now.

56:30.076 --> 56:36.744
- Got to go. See you. - All right. Take care.

57:05.903 --> 57:08.486
What a strange voice.

58:03.042 --> 58:07.753
What a remarkable place.

58:17.515 --> 58:21.976
Hello? Is anybody here?

58:27.900 --> 58:31.860
Oh God!

58:34.823 --> 58:39.067
Am I really that looking?

59:42.431 --> 59:47.051
Sarah, honey. The time has come to go toosaan.

59:54.235 --> 59:56.773
I had a bike but time to scrap.

59:57.238 --> 01:00:00.947
- I did not hear what you said. - I drove prätkäni scrap.

01:00:01.366 --> 01:00:05.610
- That is irresponsible. - That's what I'm like. I...

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:09.576
- Excuse me. - Hello? I'm at a party.

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:14.661
I've probably got a lot of messages from the girls.

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:18.544
Does anyone have a charger?

01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:41.609
- Did you get my message? - I just got.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:51.075
Good. I can hardly wait.

01:01:03.302 --> 01:01:05.259
Oh, hell.

01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:10.933
Sarah? Are you still here?

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:17.147
- Larisa? - Larisa.

01:01:20.402 --> 01:01:23.270
Huhuu?

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:32.532
You need help. Are you okay?

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:03.275
Sarah!

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:19.040
Sarah!

01:02:21.086 --> 01:02:24.670
Where have you been? There is Kimuli with broken glass on his face!

01:02:25.131 --> 01:02:27.339
He is pretty awful condition.

01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:30.384
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

01:02:37.227 --> 01:02:41.187
Bring him to me.

01:02:44.276 --> 01:02:47.189
Come on.

01:02:49.572 --> 01:02:52.610
Cheer up!

01:02:55.661 --> 01:03:00.156
Light? Lucy?

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.163
"I'm at a party. Lucy."

01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:36.901
- I did not go farther. - I do not do it again!

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.660
Such as you should be sterilized!

01:03:49.672 --> 01:03:54.667
You're just a drunk bitch!

01:04:21.495 --> 01:04:24.988
The time has come to write this review.

01:04:30.045 --> 01:04:35.006
It was not the first sauce. Brothels in this supposedly is?

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:40.420
Lucy, let's go out to talk to.

01:04:40.889 --> 01:04:45.008
What the heck? May I come too?

01:04:51.608 --> 01:04:55.022
- Here. - Thank you.

01:04:56.947 --> 01:04:59.690
- I do not get at all these events. - Where's the burglar is?

01:05:00.158 --> 01:05:06.575
He tried to rape me. And I also tried to rape her.

01:05:11.085 --> 01:05:16.422
Come on, boy.

01:05:17.425 --> 01:05:20.714
Sarah, the size yourself.

01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:27.596
Please ... No, Carnacki ... He told me to go there, if there are problems.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.896
Would you say to him that you were trying to rape a burglar?

01:05:33.357 --> 01:05:39.103
This is sick! Telly, deaths and faced ...

01:05:39.572 --> 01:05:44.033
Now, this goes sick. You're going crazy.

01:05:44.493 --> 01:05:48.157
Something went with me and sid. As we had been possessed.

01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:53.541
Fortunately, I managed to get free. It felt like when it is under water -

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.453
and the lungs are about to explode and when you want to just breathe.

01:05:57.922 --> 01:06:02.132
What the hell are you talking about?

01:06:02.594 --> 01:06:09.216
Carnacki ... downstairs and immediately.

01:06:10.143 --> 01:06:13.011
I'm glad I did not take stiletto heels.

01:06:20.653 --> 01:06:25.944
I have made you to what you are. You'll thank me.

01:06:30.163 --> 01:06:34.031
For indeed.

01:06:39.213 --> 01:06:42.001
Deuce. Let's go to the stairs.

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:48.383
- No! Calling the cops. - So, this is bound to their faith.

01:06:48.847 --> 01:06:54.093
Go back and call the cops. then I'll come pick you up.

01:07:46.654 --> 01:07:49.567
- I'm coming! - No, someone else will.

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:54.993
Let me. - No, someone will come. - Who the fuck ...

01:07:55.454 --> 01:07:58.572
What the hell happened to you?

01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:03.326
Can I help you?

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:20.764
- What is going on? - What do you mean?

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:23.515
How dare you come here?

01:08:23.982 --> 01:08:30.399
After all, you see all the cameras. What is happening here?

01:08:30.863 --> 01:08:35.359
I do not know.

01:08:36.536 --> 01:08:39.620
People have a tendency to die in this house.

01:08:40.081 --> 01:08:43.948
Suicides, natural deaths. But not now.

01:08:44.376 --> 01:08:49.292
What is it about? Why do I see so sick stuff?

01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:53.751
You're now a part of this.

01:08:54.219 --> 01:09:00.716
- Sid. Where is that? - 25th floor, room 254.

01:09:01.185 --> 01:09:06.647
- Let's go. 25th floor! - I do not want to get involved in anything!

01:09:07.107 --> 01:09:13.354
The squatters are one thing, but this ... I'll call the police.

01:09:13.822 --> 01:09:21.946
You said that the police do not care! You said that you set the right here.

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:29.452
- I just work here. - Get lost.

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:38.340
I've had enough of these ice dispensing women.

01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:42.719
- Want to buy stuff? - I just want to go in there.

01:09:43.184 --> 01:09:45.971
You're not going anywhere.

01:09:57.907 --> 01:10:00.900
What the hell? It is this fucking sick!

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:55.252
- Sid? - Welcome to ...

01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:58.213
... The control room.

01:11:00.968 --> 01:11:05.338
Calm down now. Listen to this.

01:11:05.806 --> 01:11:09.425
It seems that one of the hörhöjengi has gone completely berserk.

01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:13.353
- You do not realize. Listen! - Hold this, honey.

01:11:13.814 --> 01:11:16.932
Contact tambrini or what it now is. No worries.

01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:21.941
- I'll soon as possible. - Here, people are being killed!

01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:36.376
Mark, you all right?

01:11:45.553 --> 01:11:48.011
What the hell is going on?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.644
Huhuu?

01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:06.022
You are so good. That's what I always admired you, Sarah.

01:12:08.076 --> 01:12:13.322
I have made you what you are today.

01:12:15.124 --> 01:12:19.084
- Sid. - Mom, are you there?

01:12:19.963 --> 01:12:24.548
I was close to invalidate all when you came.

01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:30.634
Look at my body. I have sat in a chair in my whole life.

01:12:31.098 --> 01:12:34.011
Among the audience.

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:37.935
Where's my mom?

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:46.145
The sequel to it is better than the original.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.128
That's not your mother! Let's go!

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:12.386
Sid. I first thought you villain.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:19.060
The homeless, who harassed blue-eyed teenage girls.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.684
Did he supposedly would be in love with you?

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.607
It did not come to anything.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:33.692
- Mom, wake up! - I will extend now the actress.

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:42.040
Quietly. Living controlled is too difficult.

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:48.543
- Mom, what the hell ?! - Your mother is dead.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:53.547
- I am Mary Butler. - Yes, it is sucks! Let's go!

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:59.474
I died, and no one noticed! Four years in that chair!

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:03.770
Four years I looked at how you ate, slept, fucked ...

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:11.694
- I moved here a few days ago. - Yes. Young blue-eyed.

01:14:12.155 --> 01:14:18.152
You became a full report on the heroine.

01:14:51.694 --> 01:14:56.405
- Will happen now? - Yes, but do not worry about from Mark.

01:14:56.865 --> 01:15:00.779
- We have to help him. - This will be a surprising end.

01:15:01.245 --> 01:15:04.704
Do not ask him to explain. He has more to think about.

01:15:05.165 --> 01:15:08.033
It is much easier with the poor people.

01:15:08.502 --> 01:15:13.543
I tried to get your thoughts -

01:15:13.966 --> 01:15:17.129
but you were too broken.

01:15:17.552 --> 01:15:21.592
- Fuck you! - Leave her alone!

01:15:37.196 --> 01:15:39.609
- Now get out of here! - We must help Lucy and Kate.

01:15:40.074 --> 01:15:43.488
- Will die if we go over there! - Sid, please!

01:15:43.953 --> 01:15:47.412
The whole house has just sucks! We die if we go over there.

01:15:47.874 --> 01:15:52.414
- I'll go alone then. - Do not, Sarah! Goddamn it!

01:16:08.018 --> 01:16:11.056
Out of it!

01:16:12.814 --> 01:16:17.184
Mark...

01:16:52.978 --> 01:16:56.597
Statisteja.

01:17:02.071 --> 01:17:07.487
- Die, you fucking zombies! - You have no imagination.

01:17:07.952 --> 01:17:13.539
- Then do it better yourself. - Now the dog after the hare!

01:17:16.252 --> 01:17:23.000
This man was damn cool. Have to go there again.

01:17:23.676 --> 01:17:26.089
- Sid! - Excuse me!

01:17:27.762 --> 01:17:30.095
Kuolkaa, mulkerot!

01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:50.154
- A very happy that you came back. - Carnacki gave a good example.

01:17:50.618 --> 01:17:55.579
- Is that the only reason? - Let's go already!

01:18:06.634 --> 01:18:10.719
I do not think that it was possessed.

01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:59.093
I know that you're here. This is the best place for a sick loppukohtaukselle.

01:19:10.321 --> 01:19:12.153
Here it is again.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.452
Go to the ground floor and out of the house. I need to save Sarah.

01:19:18.913 --> 01:19:21.701
Young passion.

01:19:22.166 --> 01:19:25.876
Mother against daughter. Child against adults.

01:19:26.337 --> 01:19:29.580
I'm not a child and you are not my mother.

01:19:30.049 --> 01:19:34.134
Let me Lucy.

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:45.562
- You want me to. - Sid, get Lucy!

01:19:49.693 --> 01:19:53.232
Sid!

01:20:02.372 --> 01:20:06.286
You are not allowed to leave. You belong to my story.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.125
This is not your story!

01:20:26.854 --> 01:20:30.347
No voi hitto.

01:20:33.152 --> 01:20:37.487
Hank Monday, first thing in another job.

01:20:39.533 --> 01:20:43.117
Only one of us gets out of this roof.

01:20:43.579 --> 01:20:47.698
And I'm a hero. -Yeah, But this can end tragically.

01:20:48.167 --> 01:20:52.753
There is nothing more tragic than you.

01:21:06.601 --> 01:21:10.686
The first thing on Monday.

01:21:18.529 --> 01:21:24.321
What do you say? Two girls, one boy. Small party?

01:21:24.786 --> 01:21:27.529
- Shut up, Sid. - Let's go.

01:21:27.997 --> 01:21:33.288
Why not? Let's make this night unforgettable yet.
