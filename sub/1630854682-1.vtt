00:03.170 --> 00:05.571
(dance music)
(cheers)

00:08.008 --> 00:11.376
- All right, y'all,
where my party people at?

00:11.379 --> 00:12.944
(cheers)

00:12.980 --> 00:14.779
Come here, get up here,
get up here.

00:14.815 --> 00:20.652
Shout out to my girl, my sister
from another mister, my bff,

00:20.721 --> 00:24.256
Saffron sims!
(cheers)

00:27.228 --> 00:29.594
- I would never make it down
the aisle

00:29.663 --> 00:31.529
If it wasn't for this woman!

00:31.565 --> 00:33.331
(cheers)

00:33.367 --> 00:36.935
She's doing everything
to pull this wedding together,

00:37.004 --> 00:41.273
Including dragging my little ass
all the way back to canada!

00:41.342 --> 00:43.942
(cheers)

00:44.078 --> 00:47.546
Give it up for
the best maid of honour,

00:47.615 --> 00:50.148
Miss kelly jones!

00:50.217 --> 00:52.351
(cheers)

00:52.353 --> 00:55.821
- Please, please, please, god,
oh please, god, oh please, god,
oh please, god, please, please.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.022
(beeping)

00:57.157 --> 00:59.424
Oh, yeah.
(startling)

00:59.460 --> 01:02.094
Okay, here we go,
here we go, okay, okay.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.964
Yes, yes, yes. Faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster, and...

01:05.966 --> 01:07.298
(beeping)

01:07.334 --> 01:09.701
- Get a real job!
Defund the police!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.169
- Hey!

01:21.082 --> 01:24.316
- You got a tissue?
Or like a wet wipe?

01:24.318 --> 01:26.451
Or like a gum wrapper?
A napkin?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.720
I mean, yesterday's news?
I'll take a dirty diaper...
- Shush!

01:28.856 --> 01:30.255
- Don't you shush me.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.124
I've been riding with you
for eight months

01:32.259 --> 01:34.493
And I keep saying to
stop shushing me, so shush.
- Shush!

01:34.495 --> 01:35.794
- Shush!
- Shush!
- Shush!

01:35.796 --> 01:37.496
(together): Shush!

01:44.171 --> 01:45.737
- You got the stuff?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.412
- From haifa?
- Uh-huh.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.480
- I don't want any second-rate
sabich, you know?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.749
- I know.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.851
- Oh my god.

02:02.089 --> 02:06.625
Cops eating take out, this is
every taxpayer's nightmare. This
is what criminals pray for.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.696
- Fried eggplant, homemade amba,
it's what everyone prays for.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.397
- I wish you were still
my mentor.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.466
- She is not my mentor,
thank you.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.235
- Trusted partner,
islands in the stream, whatever.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.504
(sigh)
I'm just saying this woman
makes me a better man.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.173
- I can make you a better woman.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.408
- Listen, trust takes a while
to build,

02:23.444 --> 02:25.911
Chase and swallows, you know,
we're not there yet.
(beeping)

02:28.949 --> 02:30.649
Okay, go for wazowski.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.518
<i> - 8598, we have a noise</i>
<i> complaint at 180 pearl street.</i>

02:33.587 --> 02:35.253
- Okay, copy, on it.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.723
Be right there. Out, go, now.
- What?

02:37.725 --> 02:40.558
(uptempo music)

02:42.530 --> 02:44.830
- It's a very high-stake
situation,

02:44.832 --> 02:47.265
So I want you to stay
in the car, be ready to call
for backup.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.468
- Yeah. It's a noise complaint?

02:49.470 --> 02:51.502
- Yeah, they can be tricky,
though.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.206
- Right.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.945
- Hey, ladies.
Wild night, uh? Party?

03:00.014 --> 03:02.948
- You're not here to make
friends, swallows,
not that you could.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.686
Let's see how swallows screws up
a noise complaint.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.022
- My partner is a bit of a nerd,
so I told her to stay in the
car.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.691
I said, "stay in the car,
nerd cop!"

03:12.693 --> 03:14.959
(laughing)
- excuse me?

03:14.995 --> 03:18.062
- Yeah, yeah.

03:18.098 --> 03:22.967
Oh, the bride, yeah, absolutely.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.636
Congratulations.

03:24.771 --> 03:27.572
- Whoa! Oh, whoa! Whoa!

03:27.575 --> 03:30.041
Is there a problem, officer?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.110
- I know you.
(laughing)

03:32.112 --> 03:33.712
- No, you don't.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.182
- Tara swallows, and you're...
(honking)

03:41.889 --> 03:43.788
- No, man, I'm sorry,
I don't know no cops.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.058
- Not a man and...
(honking)

03:48.729 --> 03:51.029
I'll be right back,
just give me a moment.
- Mm-hmm.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.497
(laughing)

03:52.633 --> 03:54.098
- What is your problem,
wazowski?

03:54.134 --> 03:56.534
- You need to leave it as noise
complaint or whatever it is now,

03:56.570 --> 03:58.604
There's an undercover officer
in the mix.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.372
- Yeah, I just saw
detective duff.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.974
- Who was
the undercover officer!

04:02.109 --> 04:03.875
- I knew that.
- Yeah.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.745
- Absolutely. Thank you all
so, so much,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.414
Hope you have a great evening.
We got to run

04:09.450 --> 04:13.418
Because we got a lot
of policing to do this evening.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.453
It's a lot to be police,

04:15.455 --> 04:17.155
A lot of things, so have a...
Stay safe.

04:17.291 --> 04:22.360
Take it home safe.
- Good to know we can always
count on the women in blue!

04:22.396 --> 04:24.896
(♪♪)

04:49.523 --> 04:51.255
(sigh)

04:58.065 --> 05:01.333
- It's an aussie teal duncan.
(startling)

05:01.335 --> 05:03.401
I got one for myself too,
I couldn't resist.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.270
- It's amazing.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.274
You're amazing.
Where did you get it?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.410
- I got people, I got sources.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.246
- You were right, you know.
- I know.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.548
About what?

05:16.683 --> 05:18.950
- My blood pressure.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.952
It goes way down
when I look at these guys.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.823
- Yeah, well, it's a little
world that we can control.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.125
(indistinct chatter)

05:29.830 --> 05:33.565
- Oh my god!
Look at these dorks.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.966
- Hmm.
(laughing)

05:35.102 --> 05:36.768
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.704
- I'm showing michael
the new man cave.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.639
- It's very cool.
- Hmm.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.041
- Sorry, babe, we already ate.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.410
- I asked them to wait, but your
husband is a terrible listener.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.312
- Oh, you know, it's like
talking to the radio,

05:47.381 --> 05:50.448
And we're still divorced
so he's not exactly my husband.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.250
- What do you call him, then?

05:52.319 --> 05:54.052
- I call him... I don't know.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.488
You know, I think they need to
come up with a new word for it.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.891
What do you call an ex-husband
new live-in boyfriend?

05:59.893 --> 06:02.794
We can't be the only ones
in this weird situation.
Hello, michael.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.230
- Long night?
- Oh... Yeah, and...

06:05.232 --> 06:07.498
- Uh-uh, no.
We aren't talking about work.

06:07.534 --> 06:11.436
Sam always says she's sick
of talking about work,

06:11.571 --> 06:13.739
Whereas I can talk about work
all day, every day,

06:13.874 --> 06:16.941
Which is why I predict,
congratulations to me,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.945
I'm making partner
on Friday.
- Here we go, there it is.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.446
- Short on humility.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.415
- Don't need to tell me,
I work with him.
- Um!

06:23.550 --> 06:26.251
Ladies, sit,
the men will bring dessert.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.286
But back to what I was saying
about manny pacquiao,

06:28.355 --> 06:29.888
I don't think there's ever been
a greater fighter.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.290
- He does stop talking,
eventually.
- When he's sleeping?

06:32.326 --> 06:34.959
- Uh... You know what?
He actually talks in his sleep.
(laughing)

06:35.028 --> 06:38.497
- Hey, how did you do
for your steps today?
- Oh, 18k, you?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.565
- Shut up, I don't want
to talk about it.
(laughing)

06:40.567 --> 06:42.434
- Listen, you're a lawyer behind
a desk, I'm a beat cop.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.235
I told you it was a challenge
I was gonna win!

06:44.304 --> 06:46.838
- Still, you pushed me
to be better.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.907
That's what best friends do,
right?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.642
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.578
(♪♪)

06:56.583 --> 06:58.650
- Okay. No, I hear you.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.319
Okay, yes. Thank you.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.788
- They're pulling the plug,
aren't they?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.658
(sigh)
- okay, it's nap time.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.728
- Karina, come on, I have been
on this play for eight months.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.796
It can't all be for nothing.
- We're hemorrhaging money

07:11.799 --> 07:13.598
And we're not getting
anywhere new, kelly.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.067
- What are you talking about?
Yes, we are. Tee is getting
worried,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.002
Why do you think he's hiding out
in toronto?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.272
- Listen, if we take him down
now, at least we've got tee lin

07:20.407 --> 07:22.273
On drugs, assault,
money-laundering.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.343
- Yes, but we don't have him
on murder. Karina!

07:25.345 --> 07:27.078
He killed an informant.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.148
- We don't have a body,
we don't have a weapon. I mean,
maybe he didn't kill him.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.217
- Come on. Peterson didn't just
disappear into thin air,

07:32.352 --> 07:34.919
Tee killed him, and
his own guys have said as much.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.756
- Yes, and we can't arrest him
on gossip, so at this point,
we need forensic evidence,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.958
An eye-witness
or a straight-up confession.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.694
- Okay, well, let's get him
on a confession.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.230
Listen, tee's the target,
I have inside access to him.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.432
I'm his bridesmaid of honour,
for christ's sake.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.700
I'm so close, we can't give up
on this.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.304
- Yeah, well, then you...
Need to be a better bestie.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.505
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.840
- Because as of right now,
she's not giving you jack.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.243
- Uh?
- We don't even know if she
knows anything about the murder.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.779
- Okay, russ, russ, just give us
a minute, will you?
- Okay, like, several.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.614
- I need to be in the loop.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.016
- Okay. Oh...

08:05.052 --> 08:08.252
Uh... My milk is coming in,
I'm gonna have to pump. Oh.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.856
- Yeah, fine, fine.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.791
I'll be in my room.
(tongue clicking)
- thank you.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.526
- Bye.
- I'll save you some.

08:17.264 --> 08:21.199
- Nice one. Nothing clears
a room like "I need to pump."

08:21.201 --> 08:23.735
- Okay. Are you sure
you can do this?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.070
Because I'm hearing your words
but I'm reading your face.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.339
- Yes, I can do it, it's just...

08:28.375 --> 08:31.276
I'm spending 90 percent of my
time doing maid of honour stuff.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.610
You know what?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.446
Maybe we shouldn't have paid off
the wedding planner to quit.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.683
- Well, with her gone, you
got in even deeper with saffron,
so you're welcome.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.218
- Yes, but now, it's all I do!

08:40.353 --> 08:43.755
I'm just saying I need backup
to pull this off.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.424
- And if I could come in,
I would, but you don't get it,

08:46.493 --> 08:48.359
You're not a mother, kelly,
I'm still nursing him.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.362
- Yeah, I get it, because
you remind me of it every day.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.100
Look, if we don't get
a confession out of him
before this wedding is over,

08:56.169 --> 08:58.570
Tee's gonna fly out to bali
for their honeymoon,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.772
And if he gets the vibe
that the cops are onto him,

09:00.841 --> 09:04.275
Then there's no reason
to believe
he will ever come back.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.383
- When you get to be
as experienced as me,
you don't make those mistakes.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.719
- I don't really see it as
a mistake, it's more like
a learning experience.

09:14.755 --> 09:18.256
- Hmm. It's a really cool way
of looking at things, nick.
You'll go far.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.925
- I super value your mentorship.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.328
Like, I feel like I've grown
so much as a cop

09:23.463 --> 09:25.864
Since you started working here.
- Aw, man, peej,

09:25.866 --> 09:27.732
You really have potential.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.001
I see me in you, I do.
High-five.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.736
(indistinct conversation)

09:33.439 --> 09:36.641
- Hi! I haven't seen you guys
in weeks, I miss you,
both of you. Um...

09:36.777 --> 09:38.743
How are you?
What are you working on?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.147
- You know how our new commander
is,

09:42.282 --> 09:45.750
We're not really supposed
to talk about our cases
with the... Uniforms.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.819
- I'm not just a uniform,
don't call me a uniform

09:47.821 --> 09:50.488
Just by the fact
that I'm wearing a uniform.
Don't do that, that's not...

09:50.624 --> 09:52.424
(deep breath)
and your commander is
a dictator, by the way.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.832
- Yeah. Um...

10:00.834 --> 10:02.933
How are you?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.235
You and steve good?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.905
- Yeah. Actually,
we're... In a groove.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.240
Uh, he's about to make partner,

10:09.309 --> 10:11.843
His colleagues are awesome and,
like, I made a friend, ro.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.579
She's a lawyer in his firm,
she's really, really nice.
(deep exhalation)

10:14.581 --> 10:16.781
Anyway, how... How are you?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.984
How... Are you still dating
sarah from homicide?

10:19.987 --> 10:22.320
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually...

10:22.455 --> 10:25.323
I'm actually seeing two sarahs
now. Yeah.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.925
One with an h
and one without.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.729
- Wow.
- Yeah.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.264
(laughing)
- two sarahs?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.799
What, are you polyamorous now?
Is that...

10:34.868 --> 10:37.068
- Well... I don't know
about polyamorous.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.672
Sarah two is polyamorous
and so then, I figured I should
probably go

10:40.674 --> 10:42.674
And get myself another...

10:42.676 --> 10:44.809
Sarah, it turns out.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.413
So, then... You know, I
don't know, does that make me
polyamorous? I don't...

10:48.482 --> 10:50.882
(together): I don't know.
(laughing)
- I don't know, me neither.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.151
- I have no idea at all.
- No clue how that works.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.753
(laughing)

10:55.789 --> 10:57.989
- It's like a lot to...
To take in, but...

10:57.991 --> 10:59.523
- I don't want to think...
Okay.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.927
- Anyway, I should go, but...
- Yeah.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.763
- I like the uniform,
by the way.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.699
- Thanks. You go get detecting,
detective.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.235
- Yeah.
(♪♪)

11:12.506 --> 11:15.506
(laughing)
(indistinct conversations)

11:17.711 --> 11:19.510
- Gotcha!
- I getcha!

11:19.546 --> 11:21.312
I gotcha! I getcha gotcha!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.432
- Oh-oh.
- Commander!

11:41.501 --> 11:44.402
- Someone made a wrong turn
again, didn't they?
- I just...

11:44.471 --> 11:46.604
(laughing)
hi.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.706
- Sorry, did we not have
this conversation?

11:48.709 --> 11:51.209
Uniformed officers
without security access

11:51.278 --> 11:54.612
Are not allowed
past the threshold.
- Yeah.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.047
- Right?
- Oh, jeez.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.383
(laughing)
- it's...

11:59.453 --> 12:01.820
- Samantha.
- Samantha, right.
Hey, hey, hey.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.888
- Yeah, hi, hi.
- Come here, come here.

12:04.023 --> 12:07.091
Do you drive past your old
boyfriend's houses?
- Excuse me?

12:07.094 --> 12:10.762
- Read your old love letters,
scroll back through photos,
you know?

12:10.764 --> 12:14.098
Christmas 2008, cancun 99!
- Hey.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.833
(laughing)

12:15.969 --> 12:19.704
- In my experience,
haunting the past is not
a great way to move on.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.307
- Oh, right, sorry,
no, I just...
(clears throat)

12:22.442 --> 12:25.510
I wasn't, I just was looking
for superintendent shanks.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.912
- She's upstairs.
- Yes!

12:28.047 --> 12:30.915
I'm aware, ma'am, it's just
that there's just
one set of stairs...

12:31.050 --> 12:32.584
- Are there?

12:32.586 --> 12:35.320
- There's the fire escape,
but I just didn't think
that was practical.

12:35.322 --> 12:38.322
- Sadly, we are not
a thoroughfare, right?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.124
- Yeah.
(deep breath)

12:40.127 --> 12:42.927
- So, if I make allowances
for you, next thing I know,

12:43.062 --> 12:45.563
It's the mail carrier,
it's fedex, it's door dash,

12:45.698 --> 12:48.399
All traipsing through.
That's a bad precedent.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.167
(sigh)

13:02.983 --> 13:06.351
- Sam? How did you get in here?
I would have seen you.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.952
- Fire escape.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.087
I mean, I would have used
the regular stairs,

13:10.089 --> 13:12.523
It's just that I think
your pal gloria,
she doesn't like me very much.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.093
Your office is really nice.
(laughing)

13:16.095 --> 13:17.962
You definitely
have arrived, boss.

13:18.097 --> 13:20.531
- I love you, sam, I really do,

13:20.600 --> 13:22.367
But what are you doing here?

13:22.502 --> 13:27.572
- Well, it has been a long
eight months of me in uniform

13:27.641 --> 13:30.941
And there has been
licorice heists at the 7-11,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.111
I'm breaking up fights
in the parking lot
of central tech,

13:33.246 --> 13:35.446
The occasional left turn
and one, count it,

13:35.482 --> 13:37.782
One drug charge and that was
the sketchy psilocybin guru
on the danforth

13:37.917 --> 13:41.119
I read about in toronto life
and hum, I just...

13:41.121 --> 13:42.720
(panting)

13:42.856 --> 13:44.255
I can't take it anymore.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.123
- Okay, sit down, sit down.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.994
Uh...

13:50.063 --> 13:52.864
You have got
to get gloria's attention.

13:52.866 --> 13:57.168
You have to be bulletproof and
undeniable, strong but correct,

13:57.170 --> 13:59.370
Hard but real.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.339
- Sorry, I just need, like, a
miracle to fall out of the sky.
- No, I...

14:02.375 --> 14:04.742
- Edwina? I need a word.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.011
(deep breath)
- oh my god.
- Oh my god.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.748
- He is beautiful.
Oh, congratulations.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.750
I heard you were back in town,
how can I help?

14:12.819 --> 14:16.821
- Uh... Well, believe it or not,
I think I may need her.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.232
(startling)

14:28.301 --> 14:31.903
- No way?!
- Meet your new wedding planner.
(screams of joy)

14:34.574 --> 14:37.108
(both shouting): Yes! Yes! Yes!

14:39.679 --> 14:42.180
- I missed you so much!

14:42.315 --> 14:44.081
Can you believe that they paired
me with swallows?

14:44.117 --> 14:47.518
- Ew, but now, you back
with me, baby!
- Getting back, bitches!

14:47.520 --> 14:51.155
(singing)

14:51.191 --> 14:52.323
(clears throat)
- detectives.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.091
- How were you able
to pull this off?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.060
- Edwina shanks is
a fairy godmother.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.195
- You're sure we can trust
all this?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.864
- All you need to worry about
is who I trust,

14:59.999 --> 15:03.701
And I trust
wazowski more than anyone,
because she's my girl.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.370
(singing)

15:11.211 --> 15:14.946
- 2019, tee is working
with our guy, tony peterson,

15:15.081 --> 15:17.015
And then peterson disappears.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.884
Rumours among tee's crew say
he made peterson as an informant

15:20.019 --> 15:21.686
And kills him in buffalo,
so then,

15:21.755 --> 15:24.855
Tee books it to toronto
where his fiancé, saffron,
grew up.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.291
- Now, I get into the crew
via saffron.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.361
She's 35, nail tech,
we became friends,

15:30.496 --> 15:32.030
I actually really like her.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.031
Now, the wedding
is this Saturday in toronto.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.900
After the reception, they get on
a flight, they go to bali.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.437
We need to get a confession
out of them before
they get on that plane.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.572
- Oh, you think you're close
enough that he'll talk to you?

15:41.608 --> 15:44.175
- Well, I mean, we're cool
and all

15:44.310 --> 15:46.143
But he's not going to tell me
he killed an informant,

15:46.145 --> 15:48.813
Not unless he has good reasons,
so we need to a,
make him nervous

15:48.948 --> 15:51.883
And b, use saffron to make him
think I'm a fixer

15:52.018 --> 15:53.985
Who can take
all his problems away.
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.120 --> 15:58.522
- So, I was thinking we
do... (together): A trojan horse
with a side of stim!

15:58.558 --> 16:00.792
- You my bitch!

16:00.927 --> 16:03.260
- I am a bitch!
- No, you're my bitch.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.462
(deep voice): I'm your bitch.

16:05.498 --> 16:09.933
<i> - First step is getting you</i>
<i> in there</i>
<i> as the new wedding planner.</i>

16:11.704 --> 16:15.206
<i>I'll introduce you as my trusted</i>
<i> friend, a bridal wizard.</i>

16:17.610 --> 16:20.945
<i> If they have a problem,</i>
<i> you have the solution.</i>

16:25.552 --> 16:28.285
- But babe, are they too ombre?

16:28.321 --> 16:32.690
I'm just... I'm worried that
the girls are gonna look, like,
super last year and...

16:32.692 --> 16:34.358
(sigh)
thank god.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.627
I just picked these up
and I'm...
- Oh my god.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.363
Oh, stunning! Ombre is
so on trend at the moment.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.899
It was here, it was gone,
now it's back again
with a vengeance.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.301
Well done, up top,
kissy fingers, yes, please.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.370
- This is my girl,
samantha paupit,

16:46.373 --> 16:48.039
The wedding planner
I was telling you about.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.774
We go way back.
She works miracles.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.643
- Any friends of
kelly, yes.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.045
Saffron and tee,
you're such a gorgeous couple,

16:55.081 --> 16:56.847
You're burning my eyes,
I can't take it.
(laughing)

16:56.916 --> 16:59.183
This is what I need from you
right now,

16:59.252 --> 17:02.186
I need you to look at this
schedule. Are you with me?
Are you focused?

17:02.321 --> 17:05.689
All my suggestions,
that's what I want you to look
at, it's in red.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.258
- Oh, wow.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.926
- Is that a lot?

17:08.962 --> 17:10.795
- Thank you, I've been feeling
so overwhelmed.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.664
- It's okay, it's gonna be okay.
Do you have a pool house?

17:13.666 --> 17:14.999
- Yes.
- Yeah, you do?

17:15.134 --> 17:17.000
Okay, we're gonna turn it
into the wedding hq,

17:17.037 --> 17:18.803
Just away from the boy
even though he's so cute.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.172
Look at your shiny shoes,
I can't even handle it.
Is it this way?

17:21.174 --> 17:22.874
- That way.
- Then we're gonna go
this way.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.809
Okay, we're gonna take
a little dip in the pool.
I'm not...

17:24.944 --> 17:27.211
My foundation can hold up
my mortgage.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.314
- You rock, jonesy.
- I know, I know.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.816
I got you, boo.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.617
<i> While I build trust with tee,</i>

17:33.686 --> 17:37.688
<i>You are gonna bond with saffron.</i>
(indistinct conversation)

17:42.529 --> 17:44.429
<i> She's nervous, she's stressed,</i>
<i> you are there</i>

17:44.564 --> 17:47.331
<i> To take care of all of</i>
<i> her problems, big or small.</i>

17:48.968 --> 17:52.036
- Okay, but I have ten
out-of-towners coming by
for champagne tonight.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.705
- Honey, I'm on it.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.908
(sigh of relief)
- thank you.
- Come on, bring it in.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.644
<i> - Meanwhile, we'll put</i>
<i> the stimulation in play,</i>

18:00.713 --> 18:02.980
<i> Make sure that tee is</i>
<i> feeling the pressure,</i>

18:03.016 --> 18:04.849
<i> That the cops are onto him.</i>

18:04.851 --> 18:08.853
<i> We want him looking for a fast</i>
<i> solution to a serious problem.</i>
(doorbell)

18:10.523 --> 18:12.056
Go get that.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.392
<i>And then, we're going to give it</i>
<i> to him...</i>

18:14.394 --> 18:16.327
<i> On a platter.</i>

18:17.931 --> 18:20.764
- Hi, detective chase,
detective watts,

18:20.834 --> 18:23.767
We'd like to have a word
with one mister tee lin,
is he around?

18:23.837 --> 18:25.936
- It's the cops, should we get
rid of them for you?

18:25.972 --> 18:28.405
- Why bother?
I got nothing to hide.

18:28.407 --> 18:29.940
- Thank you, eva.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.312
- Tee lin?
- Hi. Yeah,
how can I help you guys?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.347
- You're a hard man to track
down, sir.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.416
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.
- March 2019.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.150
- You were in buffalo,
new york, correct?

18:40.186 --> 18:42.753
We have several witnesses who
put you at the curtiss hotel.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.689
- March fifth and sixth.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.490
How about this?

18:46.493 --> 18:48.792
This guy ring any bells?
- Ding-a-ling-a-ling?
- Recognize him at all?

18:48.862 --> 18:50.761
- No, never saw him before.

18:52.098 --> 18:55.032
- Okay. Well, thank you
for your time.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.633
Maybe you can check
your calendar.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.436
- March 2019.
- Give us a ring back.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.437
- You bet. Thank you.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.448
- You good?

19:13.887 --> 19:15.720
- What's going on?

19:15.855 --> 19:20.992
- Um... The cops have shown up
asking about some missing guy
in buffalo.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.994
Yeah, tee seemed
a little nervous about it.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.397
(sigh)
come on.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.869
- Let's party!
(cheers)

19:32.004 --> 19:34.472
Saffron sims, soon to be lin,
yeah!

19:34.607 --> 19:36.674
(applause)
(cheers)

19:36.676 --> 19:38.476
Okay, let's play some
wedding games.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.345
First is vow mad libs,
that's my favourite,

19:41.414 --> 19:42.980
That's gonna be really fun.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.349
Kelly's favourite wedding words
scramble

19:45.484 --> 19:47.985
And that's a really...
That's a really good one.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.553
(knocking on door)

19:57.363 --> 19:59.096
- I need to speak
with saffron sims.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.098
- What? Why me?
I didn't do anything.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.902
- You're under arrest...
For looking so damn sexy.
Come on, ladies!

20:05.037 --> 20:06.537
(cheers)

20:06.539 --> 20:09.974
- No, no, no, you guys! No!
(dancing music)

20:28.795 --> 20:30.861
(dancing music)

20:35.268 --> 20:38.135
- Saf, babe, why are you out
here? The party is inside.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.070
- Yeah, no, I'm...

20:40.106 --> 20:42.406
Just stressed about the wedding
and...

20:44.077 --> 20:45.609
And everything.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.545
Um, samantha's so great
by the way, thank you.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.314
It's such a relief to have her
here taking care of everything

20:50.449 --> 20:52.616
And yelling at everybody.
(laughing)

20:52.619 --> 20:55.552
It's just great.
- Yeah, yeah, she and I go
way back.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.488
Besides, she owes me one, so...

20:57.557 --> 20:59.222
I called in a favour.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.293
I... Uh... Helped her out
of a sticky situation, once.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.630
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.900
- Um... What kind of situation?

21:09.969 --> 21:13.504
- Oh, it's not my beans
to spill.
- Right, right.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.973
- Besides, I don't want you
to think I'm a monster.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.175
- Oh, kelly, babe,
I would never.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.111
(deep breath)
- well,

21:21.180 --> 21:23.013
Let's just say...

21:24.217 --> 21:27.451
Samantha should be doing life
in prison right now,

21:27.586 --> 21:30.921
Instead she's here hosting
a bachelorette party...

21:30.990 --> 21:32.323
(cheers)

21:36.596 --> 21:38.929
(laughing)

21:40.099 --> 21:42.266
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.803
(deep exhalation)
okay, let's just say I'm five
glasses of champagne in.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.339
Here we go.
- Here we go.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.275
- Okay. I have to talk to you
about something.

21:51.344 --> 21:54.812
My life is so different now
just because of, like, you.

21:54.881 --> 21:58.682
No, seriously, seriously,
seriously,
you are, like, my hero.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.017
- Come on, babe,
I'm your friend,

22:01.054 --> 22:02.553
What else was I going to do?

22:02.688 --> 22:05.021
- Listen, it's just like...
Yeah, but you were like
above and beyond.

22:05.058 --> 22:07.958
Yeah, my husband, he was a cheat

22:07.960 --> 22:11.729
And he was a drunk and he had
chest hair like pubic hair.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.597
- Yeah, and don't forget
abusive.

22:13.599 --> 22:16.299
- He was terrible,
but it really...

22:16.336 --> 22:18.702
I shouldn't have been like,
"I'll put drugs in your scotch

22:18.705 --> 22:20.170
And then, kick you down
the stairs."

22:20.206 --> 22:21.672
(shushing)
"now you're dead."

22:21.741 --> 22:23.240
The cops had me dead to right

22:23.309 --> 22:25.375
And you saved
my 40-year-old still tight ass.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.777
(shushing)
what?

22:26.912 --> 22:29.313
- Guys, guys, it's fine,
I don't care.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.048
- Oh.
- No, honestly, it just makes me
like you more.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.919
- It's just that I drank
too much champagne.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.820
- You're the best friend
I've ever had,

22:36.889 --> 22:38.922
I trust you
and you guys can trust me.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.925
Just tell me everything.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.528
- Okay...

22:44.597 --> 22:47.531
I set up this guy from
flower's cove to take the wrap,

22:47.533 --> 22:50.000
Breaking and entering,
accidental death,

22:50.002 --> 22:51.668
About ten years,

22:51.704 --> 22:56.506
He'll probably do about four,
but his family is set for life.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.343
- I'm a grateful widow.

23:02.548 --> 23:06.283
- You guys, just the best,
you're the best. I'm...

23:06.419 --> 23:09.887
I'm just gonna go
say good night to tee.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.556
- Hey, hey,
you can't say anything.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.425
- No, kelly, circle of trust,

23:15.461 --> 23:17.428
You are my maid of honour.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.029
I'll see you in the morning.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.266
- How did I do?
That was pretty good, eh?

23:22.268 --> 23:24.501
Good undercover.
- Yeah.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.104
(sigh)
why do I feel so bad?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.316
We need more chairs! Don't look
at me unless you're carrying
a chair.

23:39.352 --> 23:41.384
Everybody just needs
to calm down.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.320
- No!

23:43.322 --> 23:46.190
Miya broke her ankle getting out
of the uber last night.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.391
- I'm so sorry for miya.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.860
- No. She's number four,
I have four bridesmaids,

23:49.896 --> 23:53.129
Tee has four grooms and we have
to match for the photos,

23:53.166 --> 23:55.933
For the symmetry. Symmetry is
the definition of beauty.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.267
- Well, not true, actually.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.137
It's wabi-sabi, it's the little
quirks that make
for real beauty.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.605
- Dress.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.675
Dress.

24:04.744 --> 24:08.012
(deep breath)
(together): Dress!

24:09.281 --> 24:11.615
- Perfect.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.884
It's perfect.

24:14.019 --> 24:17.287
Welcome to the inner circle,
samantha.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.923
(laughing)
(sigh of relief)

24:21.294 --> 24:23.494
- When you get married, who's
gonna be your maid of honour?

24:23.563 --> 24:26.764
And I just want you to remember
how much hard work goes into
being a maid of honour,

24:26.766 --> 24:28.765
I think I've really, really
proven my mettle, this week.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.469
- I don't know, and I got
a couple of sisters,

24:31.604 --> 24:33.504
So you're just gonna have
to get in line.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.973
- Oh, well, maybe when
ro gets married, I can be
her maid of honour.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.674
- Who's ro?

24:37.676 --> 24:40.443
- Uh... She works with steve,
she's a lawyer, she's my friend.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.045
- Uh.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.981
I guess a lot's happened
in eight months.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.885
You're back with steve,
you've got a new friend.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.286
(deep breath)

24:49.322 --> 24:51.989
I... Gave up my apartment.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.525
- Oh, you need to buy a place?
- I don't know.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.727
You know, I was kind of looking
for a fresh start but really,

24:56.862 --> 24:58.729
I just want to get back
to nathan.
(sigh)

24:58.798 --> 25:01.598
- Let's get her done.
We've baited the hook,

25:01.734 --> 25:03.467
Let's hope he bites.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.335
- We got four hours.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.504
All right, earrings.
- Let's do this.

25:12.411 --> 25:13.811
(sigh)

25:13.946 --> 25:15.346
- We good? Can you hear us?

25:15.348 --> 25:17.948
<i> Do we have a plan b,</i>
<i> just in case this goes south?</i>

25:18.017 --> 25:20.885
- Yeah, we have our backup team
keeping eyes on tee's guys,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.453
But you got to keep your phones
on you.

25:22.588 --> 25:25.022
- It's gonna be hard,
look at these dresses,
where are we gonna put it?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.623
- Well, you got your earrings

25:26.659 --> 25:28.825
<i> And they're recording,</i>
<i>so let's just have a little bit</i>
<i> of faith, okay?</i>

25:28.827 --> 25:30.127
- Okay.
- Hey!

25:30.262 --> 25:31.562
Saffron?

25:31.697 --> 25:33.163
- Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.699
<i> - Uh... You know,</i>
<i> I think she's still with...</i>

25:35.768 --> 25:37.001
Alfredo.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.236
I think she has a little
contouring issue or something.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.904
- I just want to drop these off.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.839
You guys have been so helpful,

25:42.875 --> 25:44.908
We literally could not have
done this without you.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.377
- Oh, wow.

25:46.512 --> 25:47.945
- She was so worried about
the colour,

25:47.947 --> 25:49.746
I just wanted her
to feel good about the choice.

25:49.748 --> 25:51.515
- These are gorgeous but
you know, I already got
earrings.

25:51.584 --> 25:54.451
- Yeah? Let me see them.
- Nothing fancy.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.653
- Well, then, trash them,
kelly, take these.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.622
- What?
- Shit.

25:58.624 --> 26:03.326
<i> - Come on, they're yours</i>
<i> to keep. Put them on.</i>

26:03.362 --> 26:05.795
- Okay, if you say so.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.798
(feedback)

26:08.834 --> 26:11.001
<i> - Get one too. Thank you</i>
<i> for stepping up.</i>

26:11.136 --> 26:12.836
I bought four pairs
so you'd get one.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.673
- My god, you are so kind,
I can't believe it.
You know what I'm gonna do?

26:15.675 --> 26:18.341
I'm gonna put these on a little
bit later because I got to keep
this little headset

26:18.377 --> 26:19.743
<i> For the big show.</i>

26:19.878 --> 26:21.945
<i> Wedding planner's work, what?</i>
<i> It's never done.</i>
<i> (laughing)</i>

26:21.948 --> 26:23.547
- Good.
- Wish me luck.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.749
(together): Good luck!

26:28.454 --> 26:30.888
(violin music)

26:31.023 --> 26:33.423
- But what about
if everyone isn't here?

26:33.492 --> 26:36.893
Wait, who is everyone anyway?
I guess it doesn't matter,
does it?

26:36.929 --> 26:39.029
'cause I uninvited
my high school friends,
my parents are dead

26:39.098 --> 26:40.764
And everyone
who actually matters is
in the wedding party,

26:40.899 --> 26:42.499
So everyone else is gravy.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.702
Is that weird? Is that weird
to call people gravy?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.770
Am I speaking too loud?
- No.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.972
(indistinct conversation)

26:54.246 --> 26:57.047
- Yes, yes. Listen to me,

26:57.083 --> 26:59.183
You look beautiful.
(sigh of relief)
- thank you.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.617
- Okay? You ready?

27:00.653 --> 27:03.120
- Okay, yes.
- Flowers. Okay,
thank you, everyone.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.588
Back, back, back, back, back.
All righty.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.658
- Thank you guys so much.
- Okay, focus, focus, focus.

27:07.660 --> 27:11.795
- All right, here comes the
bride, and... Three, two, one.

27:11.797 --> 27:15.399
(wedding music)
(camera click)

27:34.553 --> 27:37.120
- Tee lin, you have
changed my life.

27:38.691 --> 27:41.891
You take care of me,
you cherish me.

27:43.029 --> 27:46.697
Trusting people
can be so risky,

27:46.699 --> 27:50.300
But you've taught me to believe
in the best in others

27:50.369 --> 27:52.769
And in the best in myself.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.338
(wedding music)

27:54.340 --> 27:56.039
(shutter click)

28:07.386 --> 28:09.586

he's freaking out.

28:09.622 --> 28:12.489

out of time.

This isn't something
that I'm proud about.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.304
(hip hop music)

31:14.439 --> 31:17.007
- You know, when kelly first
mentioned you,

31:17.009 --> 31:19.142
I was jealous.
- Oh.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.511
- But you're just
as cool as she is.
- Yeah, but you know what?

31:21.647 --> 31:24.381
Three's not a crowd, honey,
it's a party.

yes, yes, yes, yes.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.851

- you're right.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.319
(sigh)

31:29.454 --> 31:33.190
- Look, I... I had a guy
in buffalo,

31:33.192 --> 31:36.526
We did a bunch of deals
together, we were tight.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.796
But then I found out
he was a rat.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.065
- So what did you do?

31:42.901 --> 31:44.367
- Took him out.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.570
<i> - What do you mean?</i>

31:46.572 --> 31:49.872
<i> You took him out where?</i>
<i> - I took him out,</i>

31:49.909 --> 31:51.341
<i> I got rid of him.</i>

31:51.343 --> 31:52.943
- Come on, spell it out!

31:52.945 --> 31:57.146
(sigh)
- okay, so like,
threatened his life?

31:57.182 --> 31:59.616
Is he in a different country?
I mean...

32:01.754 --> 32:04.087
Is he coming back?
That's what I need to know.

32:06.124 --> 32:08.291
- No, he's not,

32:08.360 --> 32:12.061
Not unless he's crawling out

in lancaster, new york.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.165

<i> - I've got a guy in mind,</i>

32:17.903 --> 32:22.172
You know, with a big family,
a lot of money problems,

32:22.241 --> 32:25.976
He'll be willing to do the time
for the right price.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.113
- What's that?

32:31.317 --> 32:32.782
What is that?

32:32.818 --> 32:35.786
- It's the earring
that you threw out.

32:39.091 --> 32:42.592
- You dug it out of the garbage
and have been holding it
since the wedding?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.260
- Yeah, you know, I...
(sigh)

32:44.296 --> 32:46.663
I get attached, I'm weird
like that, it's just...

32:47.666 --> 32:49.766

33:26.171 --> 33:27.904

33:27.973 --> 33:30.140

it's a beautiful name,

33:30.142 --> 33:31.475
But come with me, please.
Come on.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.509

is kelly a cop too?

33:34.847 --> 33:36.579
- Come on.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.716

confessing, he saw her mic.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.051
Here.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.653

Don't move a muscle!

34:03.776 --> 34:06.008
Put it down!
You put it down now!

34:06.045 --> 34:08.144
- Take it easy.
- She trusted you.

34:08.180 --> 34:12.482
- This isn't about saffron,
it's about you,
you killing somebody.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.017
- And you know I can pull
this trigger and walk away

34:15.054 --> 34:17.353
Without ever giving you
another thought,

34:17.355 --> 34:19.122
Because I just don't care.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.656

34:53.258 --> 34:55.658
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Can you hear me?

34:55.727 --> 34:59.362

No! Oh! Here.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.331

35:05.203 --> 35:07.137

35:15.347 --> 35:16.946

she hasn't come back yet.

35:16.982 --> 35:20.617
- Sam, what are you doing?
- I'll just use fabric.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.252
- No!
- We need to keep you warm.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.426
- Hm, juicy.

35:30.362 --> 35:31.628
Um...

35:31.697 --> 35:34.564
Interesting, hints of charcoal,
maybe?

35:36.235 --> 35:39.101
You want it?
- No, thank you.
I just like to watch.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.439
(tense music)

35:48.013 --> 35:51.381
- All units, we're looking

35:51.516 --> 35:54.450
Naz, nathan,
any sign of sam or kelly?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.253

Is there anybody out there?

36:00.025 --> 36:01.524

Are you okay?

36:08.133 --> 36:10.133

36:10.135 --> 36:15.939
- You've been playing me
for eight months!

36:16.074 --> 36:21.010
- No. Okay, I'm so sorry, okay?
I was just doing my job.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.148
- Did you even like me?

36:25.217 --> 36:28.884
- Saf, of course I did.
- Don't...

36:32.291 --> 36:33.990
- Come on.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.964

36:41.033 --> 36:44.034
He must still be inside.
(dramatic music)

36:46.972 --> 36:49.739

37:00.352 --> 37:01.484
No!

37:06.258 --> 37:08.057
- Kell!

37:08.126 --> 37:10.426
- Karina! Is she going
to be okay?

37:11.930 --> 37:14.431
- No, god, no.
- We can do this.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.934
- Give it to me.
Okay, I got you.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.937
- Hands! Hands!
Hands! Let me see those hands
right now!

37:21.072 --> 37:24.607
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

37:24.643 --> 37:27.109
Get out! Turn around,
nice and slow.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.248
Tee lin, you're under arrest
for the murder of tony peterson

37:32.251 --> 37:33.950
And god knows what else.
- Give me an ambulance!

37:33.952 --> 37:35.885
Give me an ambulance now!

37:35.887 --> 37:38.587
- You're gonna be okay.
- I got you, karina.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.966
- Kell?

37:51.970 --> 37:53.235
Kelly?

37:55.173 --> 37:57.974
Jesus christ, kelly!
Get up.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.509
- Um. Karina?
(sigh)

38:03.015 --> 38:04.781
How are you feeling?

38:05.751 --> 38:07.049
- Where is brixton?

38:07.085 --> 38:09.386
- Um, he's with the nanny
at the hotel until I get back.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.087
- What?
- He's fine, okay?

38:11.123 --> 38:12.655
I just talked to them.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.926
- Okay, okay.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.394
Thank you, it's good.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.796
- But you, on the other hand,

38:19.865 --> 38:21.531
You have a concussion

38:21.666 --> 38:25.535
And a fractured shoulder
and you're gonna have a pretty
sexy scar on that head.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.003
- How long?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.805
- How long is the scar?
I don't know yet...

38:28.940 --> 38:31.607
- How long am I in here?

38:31.643 --> 38:32.609
- They're saying a week.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.677
- A week?
- Maybe two.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.146
(sigh)

38:38.483 --> 38:40.616
- Can you keep brixton?

38:41.619 --> 38:44.554
- Me? Are you sure?

38:44.556 --> 38:48.692
- Yeah, brix knows you
and you know his routine

38:48.827 --> 38:51.494
And the nanny can stay with you
at the hotel.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.229
- Seriously, karina?

38:53.298 --> 38:55.832
Because all you've done since
that boy was born

38:55.901 --> 38:59.034
Is point out how I don't know
what I'm talking about
since I'm not a mother.

38:59.071 --> 39:02.037
- Don't you know me by now?
I love holding something
over you.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.575
But do you think I'd put
that boy in your hands

39:05.644 --> 39:08.311
If I didn't have
absolute faith in you?

39:10.248 --> 39:11.947
I trust you.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.252
You're aunty kelly.

39:24.096 --> 39:25.195
- Wazowski.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.338
- Sorry. I'm sorry,

39:36.375 --> 39:39.341
I just needed to see naz
to get a few details
for the report

39:39.378 --> 39:41.678
And then I'll be back
in uniform tomorrow.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.813
- No, you won't.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.881
- Excuse me?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.350
- Your work has been...

39:48.387 --> 39:52.221
Acknowledged upstairs
and I have been...

39:52.290 --> 39:54.424
Mandated

39:54.426 --> 39:56.960
To invite you back
into the oce,

39:57.095 --> 40:01.498
Along with detective duff.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.699

40:05.837 --> 40:07.570
That's um...

40:08.373 --> 40:11.574
That's wonderful.
Okay.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.612
Thank you.
(♪♪)

40:38.269 --> 40:40.069
- I didn't get it.
- Ah!

40:42.140 --> 40:46.008
Oh, baby. Oh my god,
are you okay?

40:46.044 --> 40:47.544
- I didn't get it.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.545
- You didn't get it? I'm sorry,
what do you mean? I'm just...

40:49.614 --> 40:52.815
- Partner.
I didn't make partner.

40:54.186 --> 40:57.286
- Oh, I'm... I'm really sorry.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.755
You must be very disappointed.

40:59.757 --> 41:02.959
- They said I was arrogant,
a mansplainer, whatever
that means.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.295
- Well, I mean...
- Well, I could tell you
what that means.

41:05.297 --> 41:09.365
It means that ro is making
partner instead because she's
a woman who talks nicely.

41:09.434 --> 41:14.770
- Since when was being nice
part of a criminal lawyer's job?
(sighs)

41:14.806 --> 41:19.042
- Yeah, so you must just be
really sad.

41:19.044 --> 41:22.378
Can I get you
a cup of tea?

41:23.648 --> 41:25.848
- Do we have valerian?
- We don't, we don't have...

41:25.917 --> 41:27.383
We got mint, we have mint.

41:27.452 --> 41:30.853
- Okay, okay, mint's fine.
- Okay, you're... Welcome.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.526
- How was your day?
- My day was...
(clears throat)

41:36.595 --> 41:39.062
It was regular,
don't worry about me.

41:55.447 --> 41:57.212
(groaning)

42:02.254 --> 42:04.554
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.657
Listen, I know you were hoping
for a more romantic reunion,

42:07.726 --> 42:12.127
But he just fell asleep.
- It's all right.
Give me the baby.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.301
How is karina?

42:18.303 --> 42:20.669
(sigh)
- she'll live, thank god.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.706
(groaning)

42:23.841 --> 42:27.043
I can't even think about
all the paperwork I'll have
to do for this case.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.911
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:34.152 --> 42:37.219
(romantic music)
may I have this dance?

42:40.725 --> 42:42.558
- Yes.

42:54.205 --> 42:56.538
(humming)

43:00.979 --> 43:04.881
Oh my god, I don't even know
what time it is.
- Don't worry about it,

43:05.016 --> 43:07.349
Take tomorrow off.

43:07.385 --> 43:11.186
