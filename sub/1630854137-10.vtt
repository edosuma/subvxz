00:22.848 --> 00:24.459

00:26.548 --> 00:28.680

00:28.680 --> 00:31.466
<i>You are taking
the Fordham job.</i>

00:31.466 --> 00:32.336
I am.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.512
My wife, the professor.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.123
I know that
you have to do this.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.776
I have to try.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.606
I love you, Amanda.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.478
I love you, Liv.

00:51.399 --> 00:54.619
I see a lot of people
come and go.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.143
I never thought
she'd be one of them.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.579
Yeah.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.972
She left the chipmunk,
so there's that.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.148
What do you wanna do with it?

01:01.148 --> 01:02.758
Well, now that she's gone,

01:02.758 --> 01:05.935
McGrath is finally gonna have
to sign off on more bodies.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.155
We're gonna need
this desk space eventually.

01:08.155 --> 01:11.419
Yeah, just put it
in the break room.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.377
What, you wanna eat with
this thing looking at you?

01:13.377 --> 01:14.639
Fin, I don't care
where you put it.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.990
It just--it can't
stay out here.

01:17.990 --> 01:21.733
I feel it too, her absence.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.348
Good night, Fin.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.219
Nothing good ever
happens at night.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.526
Speaking of.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.136
Chief. You look rattled.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.920
Is everything okay?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.226
No.

01:45.453 --> 01:46.758
You still beating yourself up

01:46.758 --> 01:48.934
about that sex bunker guy
from Fishkill?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.371
Elias Olsen.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.938
Yeah, I know which one
you're talking about, Duarte.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.419
The whole damn trial blew up
because of my temper.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.508
Pretty conceited, isn't it?

01:57.508 --> 01:59.945
Judge calls a mistrial because
some lady cop goes all Karen

01:59.945 --> 02:01.991
on the witness stand.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.601
That's not enough.

02:06.430 --> 02:10.173
Do not call me a Karen
while I'm armed.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.523
All I'm saying,
you're not that important.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.398
Maybe I'm not
cut out for SVU.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.269
You telling me you wanna
come back to Gangs?

02:19.269 --> 02:21.402
If I did?

02:21.402 --> 02:24.056
I'd tell you you made
your bed, and now it's wet.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.800
Figure out a way to lie in it.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.237
That's your advice?

02:30.237 --> 02:31.760
That's my advice.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.289
A civil rights investigation
by the Department of Justice.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.291
Into one of our units.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.555
Chief, we both know
that Bronx SVU

02:44.555 --> 02:47.384
has been a mess for a while.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.212
Question is,
why are they coming in now?

02:49.212 --> 02:52.650
It was all triggered by that
wrongful termination case.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.435
The whistleblower cop, yeah.
What is his name?

02:54.435 --> 02:56.132
Terry. Terry--yeah.
- Terry Bruno.

02:56.132 --> 02:59.396
God, there was a lot of dirty
laundry came out of that case.

02:59.396 --> 03:03.835
Well, if you ask me,
the guy did the city a favor.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.489
Oh, no. Trust me.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.839
The guy's no saint.
He did it for the money.

03:07.839 --> 03:11.495
And from what I hear, he got
himself a nice little payout.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.193
Well, if that's
what it takes to make

03:13.193 --> 03:14.498
change up there, good for him.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.544
Well I'm glad
that's how you feel.

03:16.544 --> 03:17.849
What does that mean?

03:17.849 --> 03:20.069
Solidarity.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.030
You want me
to go up to The Bronx?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.336
Yes, I do.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.686
The only way to get
the Feds out of there

03:28.686 --> 03:31.254
is to clear a bunch of cases.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.516
Okay, don't you have
anyone else?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.605
You know that
I am one person down.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.041
And whose fault is that?

03:36.041 --> 03:38.261
You're the one who told Rollins
to seek the truth,

03:38.261 --> 03:39.436
or whatever it was.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.569
Look, I'm not--
I'm not saying no.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.659
But offhand,
I don't have the time.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.443
I don't have the resources.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.445
And that sounds
an awful lot like a no.

03:48.445 --> 03:49.881
Let me think about it?

03:49.881 --> 03:51.709
I don't have time
to let you think.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.755
This is a very big ask
on very short notice.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.279
Hey, what's up with McGrath?
My guy's looking shattered.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.542
Whatever it is, I'm guessing
Liv ain't gonna be the one

03:58.542 --> 04:00.327
to glue his ass back together.

04:02.677 --> 04:06.550
So we'll eat first
and then homework, right?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.857
I can eat and do homework
at the same time.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.380
It's called multitasking.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.860
Oh, I know what it means.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.916
Mom, what's going on?

04:24.916 --> 04:27.919
Noah, I want you
to go inside.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.617
- But Mom, what's--
- No, no, no.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.402
Noah, now you go inside and you
tell Jorge to call the police.

04:32.402 --> 04:35.318
Honey, take this
and tell him it's a 10-13.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.451
Can you remember that?
- A 10-13?

04:37.451 --> 04:39.496
10-13, right.
And don't leave the lobby.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.332
NYPD, drop your weapon.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.291
We take what we want.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.944
Drop it, now.

04:54.816 --> 04:55.860
For Sabo.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.646
And Ricky.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.519
This is for Sleep.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.696
Hands up where
I can see them.

05:05.696 --> 05:09.352
Mom!
- Noah, get back inside!

06:11.109 --> 06:14.678
I saw the machete,
I identified myself as NYPD,

06:14.678 --> 06:16.767
and I told the boy
to drop his weapon.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.508
- Boy?
- They were so young.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.945
They were 14, 15 years old.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.165
I mean, I almost took
a shot at his head.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.123
- But you didn't?
- Did you find the kids?

06:25.123 --> 06:26.647
Not yet.
Tell me what happened.

06:26.647 --> 06:32.000
So his moped
comes out of nowhere,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.132
it knocks me to the ground.

06:34.132 --> 06:37.875
That's when I lost my weapon,
and then they kicked me.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.311
They stomped on me.

06:39.311 --> 06:42.619
And then I just caught
this glint of--of a machete.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.578
What makes you think
these guys were BX9?

06:46.275 --> 06:48.016
I worked a case
a few months back,

06:48.016 --> 06:49.757
I collared a couple of them.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.455
I'm guessing that
I was greenlit.

06:52.455 --> 06:56.111
Look--look, protocol says
that now is the time

06:56.111 --> 06:57.373
when I give you my gun.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.898
Okay?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.291
Are we done?

07:02.291 --> 07:03.553
I really need
to get back to my kid.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.686
Blow until you hear the beep.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.691
0.0, in the clear.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.083
We'll take you
to the hospital.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.694
Okay, I don't need
to go to the hospital.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.304
- Yeah, you do.
- This is my sergeant, okay?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.611
So if you don't mind.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.134
I'll wait for you
in the squad car.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.528
Not as pretty as Rollins,
but I'll try my best

07:21.528 --> 07:23.617
with this
emotional support thing.

07:23.617 --> 07:27.229
Between the two of you,
we both know who's softer.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.839
Can you believe this?

07:28.839 --> 07:32.016
It looks like the Tremont
clique know where you live.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.236
I mean,
these people are pretty ballsy

07:34.236 --> 07:38.501
going after a New York City
captain on her turf.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.633
Well, I heard on the radio

07:39.633 --> 07:41.461
you blew out
one of their kneecaps.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.853
I didn't wanna
shoot any of them.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.420
They were kids.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.945
Well, you have a lot more
restraint than I would have.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.469
He's somebody's son.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.645
Some bullets have
a lesson behind them.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.864
You know what
I don't understand?

07:53.864 --> 07:56.693
We put these bangers away
in the summer.

07:56.693 --> 08:00.654
Why are they coming
after me now?

08:00.654 --> 08:03.483
Your boy Duarte might know.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.659
Where's Noah?

08:05.659 --> 08:09.010
He's--I told him
to go inside.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.972
Fin, will you stay with him?

08:14.972 --> 08:16.321
Yeah.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.541
Me and a half dozen
of New York City's finest.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.893
I gotta go get checked out.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.986
No broken bones.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.032
BP's normal, considering.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.733
You'll be sore tomorrow,
especially your lower back.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.040
So same as yesterday.

08:42.478 --> 08:45.394
Captain Benson,
you have a visitor.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.704
Thank you.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.532
Hey, Cap.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.577
Jeez, you all right?

08:54.577 --> 08:58.842
I will be, once I get
my hands on Oscar Papa.

08:58.842 --> 09:03.630
Well, that's not an SVU case.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.979
And how do you know that--

09:04.979 --> 09:06.676
that Papa's
behind all this, anyway?

09:06.676 --> 09:09.549
Who else has the power
to greenlight

09:09.549 --> 09:12.856
a New York City captain
and her 11-year-old son?

09:12.856 --> 09:14.641
Well, I got a call
under Bronx Gangs,

09:14.641 --> 09:18.079
who no doubt will handle this
with all the swiftness

09:18.079 --> 09:19.341
that it deserves.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.342
You called Duarte?

09:20.342 --> 09:22.387
He's our expert on BX9.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.433
Well, I'm sure he loved that.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.914
Look, whatever beef exists
between you two,

09:26.914 --> 09:30.047
I suggest you put it to rest
because he's coming

09:30.047 --> 09:32.702
tomorrow morning to take
your victim statement.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.312
My victim statement?

09:34.312 --> 09:36.880
Well, you are a victim, right?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.800
Thank you.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.415
How is he?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.026
He fell asleep.

09:55.203 --> 09:59.337
No child should have
to live like this.

09:59.337 --> 10:02.732
You don't need any kind of
parenting book to know that.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.647
So what's the plan?

10:04.647 --> 10:05.996
I put in a call
to the McCanns.

10:05.996 --> 10:09.652
You know his half-brother
up in Woodstock?

10:09.652 --> 10:11.262
Liv, I can spend
the night if you want.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.437
No, no, no.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.178
Go home to Phoebe.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.224
I got this.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.399
Drive him up in the morning?

10:17.399 --> 10:18.618
That'd be great.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.762
We BX9, brother.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.242
We take what we want.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.287
Noah, call the police.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.594
Drop it, now!

10:41.858 --> 10:43.730
<i>All I could see
was their eyes.</i>

10:47.821 --> 10:51.041
Nobody knows these guys
better than Duarte.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.086
For Sabo.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.658
<i>I need to know
what I'm dealing with.</i>

11:10.495 --> 11:12.193
<i>You think this is a game?</i>

11:12.193 --> 11:14.195
<i>They've already put roots
down in Manhattan.</i>

11:14.195 --> 11:15.370
<i>What's next?</i>

11:15.370 --> 11:16.588
Noah, back inside.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.329
Mom!

11:28.296 --> 11:30.167
But how long am I gonna
have to stay with Connor?

11:30.167 --> 11:31.821
You know,
I'm not sure, sweetie.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.867
Until--until I know
that it's safe.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.564
But I don't wanna go.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.522
I wanna stay here with you.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.611
Noah, look.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.135
We can't do that.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.877
I mean, we certainly have
enough of a police presence,

11:43.877 --> 11:47.750
but remember how much fun
you had last night with Connor?

11:47.750 --> 11:50.840
And Fin came just
to drive you up, right?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.669
And I packed all your games,

11:53.669 --> 11:55.584
and I'll pick you up
before you know it.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.716
Okay?

11:58.761 --> 12:01.372
We're gonna take
good care of your mom.

12:01.372 --> 12:02.547
All right, sweetie?

12:02.547 --> 12:04.419
I love you, Mom.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.029
I love you, too, babe.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.727
Have fun.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.256
Bye-bye.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.789
Carry on.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.748
Huh? With what?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.401
Whatever it was
two were gabbing about

12:30.401 --> 12:31.707
when I walked in.

12:31.707 --> 12:32.926
Oh no, Captain.
It wasn't like that.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.493
You're a bad liar, Muncy.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.887
Velasco, not so much.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.802
I shot a kid yesterday.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.544
I want eyes on him,
medical treatment,

12:42.544 --> 12:43.588
by the end of the day.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.808
- Okay.
- On it, Cap.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.647
Captain, before we go,
you have a visitor.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.784
Captain Benson.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.613
Looking pretty good, considering.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.311
Thank you, Duarte.

13:10.311 --> 13:13.444
I was almost hacked
to death, so yeah.

13:13.444 --> 13:17.361
You know, that says a lot
about your standards.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.276
So that's it? No apology?

13:19.276 --> 13:22.540
For squashing your pie
in the sky surveillance deal?

13:22.540 --> 13:25.630
Trying to use some driver
to cut off the head of BX9?

13:25.630 --> 13:26.849
If I could've done
things my way,

13:26.849 --> 13:28.459
Oscar Papa would
already be in jail.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.505
It was half a gang case,
but you were only interested

13:30.505 --> 13:31.723
in the rape part of it.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.901
Well, we have two rapists
in prison,

13:34.901 --> 13:36.641
Sabo and Pretty Ricky, who,

13:36.641 --> 13:38.948
if my memory
serves me correctly,

13:38.948 --> 13:41.472
were gonna give up
Oscar Papa's driver.

13:41.472 --> 13:45.650
So the way I see it,
we can still flip them.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.478
Both were stabbed to death
in prison

13:47.478 --> 13:50.525
by 19th Street last month.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.656
Why do you think
you were greenlit?

13:58.272 --> 13:59.795
So now what?

14:02.363 --> 14:03.364
How do we get them?

14:05.192 --> 14:07.890
Why don't we start
with your victim statement?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.805
You want my victim statement?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.330
All right, here it is.

14:18.553 --> 14:23.863
It is important for any victim
of a violent or senseless act

14:23.863 --> 14:27.692
to reclaim their own
locus of control.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.956
That's my victim statement.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.745
Are you saying
you wanna liaise with me?

14:36.745 --> 14:38.878
I'm saying that
somebody needs to show

14:38.878 --> 14:40.923
you Bronx boys how it's done.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.667
You must have the Gang Squad
confused with Bronx SVU.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.714
If you think that you
can separate the gang problem

14:49.714 --> 14:53.893
from the rape problem up there,
I would like to see you try.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.112
It's a good offer, Captain.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.853
But if you wanna
go after Oscar Papa,

14:57.853 --> 14:59.942
you're gonna have to come up
to the Bronx,

14:59.942 --> 15:01.944
and we both know McGrath's
never gonna allow that.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.339
How about you let me
deal with McGrath?

15:10.692 --> 15:12.563
You got my calls?

15:12.563 --> 15:14.652
And your texts.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.133
So what's so important that
I had to interrupt my meeting?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.353
There's a lot of white shirts
in this room,

15:19.353 --> 15:21.007
so I'm imagining this
is all about

15:21.007 --> 15:23.618
your DOJ problem at Bronx SVU?

15:23.618 --> 15:25.185
Trying to figure out
a way to get the Feds

15:25.185 --> 15:26.447
out of our
collective underwear drawer.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.232
I think I might
be able to help you.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.755
Oh, well, that's singing
a very different tune

15:30.755 --> 15:31.843
tune than you did yesterday.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.584
Yeah, and I'll
give you a hint why.

15:33.584 --> 15:37.153
It's two letters, one number.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.241
BX9.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.548
I'm ready to go up
to the Bronx.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.984
And hunt down a gang?

15:41.984 --> 15:45.988
And hunt down a man.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.817
I'm getting my ass
handed to me in there,

15:48.817 --> 15:50.775
and that's your solution?

15:50.775 --> 15:54.518
Duarte and I already have
a plan to take down Oscar Papa.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.912
Well, that's just not
how victim statements

15:56.912 --> 15:58.261
are supposed to work.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.611
Chief, all you have to do
is walk in there

16:00.611 --> 16:03.266
and announce that you're
putting together a task force.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.528
And what, you and your people

16:04.528 --> 16:06.095
are gonna use
the Bronx SVU as what?

16:06.095 --> 16:07.401
Some kind of war room?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.490
They still have
cases to clear.

16:09.490 --> 16:10.926
We can help.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.232
That's--you said
that's what you needed.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.974
I understand that your
squad room must feel

16:14.974 --> 16:16.323
very empty without Rollins.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.412
What does this
have to do with Rollins?

16:18.412 --> 16:19.979
Displacement.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.287
Wow.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.855
Chief, with all due respect,
you've had what?

16:26.855 --> 16:29.423
Three therapy sessions?

16:29.423 --> 16:31.599
You're telling me
that you think

16:31.599 --> 16:35.820
that this is my redirecting
unwanted feelings about--

16:35.820 --> 16:37.344
about missing my friend?

16:37.344 --> 16:40.042
Am I wrong?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.436
I was with my son,

16:42.436 --> 16:47.049
and a gang came after me
with a machete.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.399
And you took
the fight to them.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.792
But now you're
asking me to let you

16:50.792 --> 16:53.577
go looking for another fight.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.840
All I'm saying is that
both of our problems

16:55.840 --> 16:57.538
are in the Bronx.

16:57.538 --> 17:01.020
Do you want me
to fix that or not?

17:10.725 --> 17:13.206
So you're telling me McGrath
signed off on all this?

17:13.206 --> 17:14.555
Well, with some parameters.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.557
- Such as?
- We save his ass.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.515
Okay, so technically,
we're only here

17:18.515 --> 17:22.084
to offer our expertise
and to close open cases.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.739
Speaking of which,
any luck finding that kid?

17:24.739 --> 17:26.697
- I checked all the hospitals.
- Okay.

17:26.697 --> 17:29.657
So you and Muncy,
talk to Duarte.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.399
Have the Gang Unit
work their CIs.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.836
Do B Debrief prisoners.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.664
Someone knows
where this kid is.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.448
- Copy that, Captain.
- And Muncy.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.798
- Yeah.
- Lose the blazer.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.065
Will do.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.985
Captain Benson.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.075
Counselor, surprised
to see you here.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.946
I thought you were
in private practice.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.601
Yeah, I keep a foot
in the Southern District.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.951
This is AUSA Ingram Wise
from DOJ Main,

18:02.951 --> 18:05.388
our most senior attorney
with boots on the ground.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.086
Ah, Wise. Nice to meet you.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.957
Glad you and your people
are here, Captain.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.828
As long as we're clear
on boundaries.

18:12.265 --> 18:15.572
We are here in a
support capacity only.

18:15.572 --> 18:18.619
So who here from Bronx SVU
is in charge?

18:18.619 --> 18:20.447
Well, most of
the power structure

18:20.447 --> 18:22.144
were forced into retirement.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.146
Well, I see there's
at least one holdover.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.279
- Terry Bruno.
- That's the whistleblower.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.671
I heard he made out big

18:27.671 --> 18:29.499
in that wrongful termination suit.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.632
$11 million in city money.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.200
So what the hell is he
doing coming in to work?

18:36.376 --> 18:39.509
How are we supposed to find
what's open in this mess?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.642
That's easy.
You're looking at it.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.426
You gotta be kidding.

18:43.426 --> 18:44.993
Have fun.

18:44.993 --> 18:48.170
It's your mess now.
- Ah, spoken like a true Fed.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.132
Captain Benson.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.437
I hope you brought
a mop and a bucket.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.613
Oh, look who it is.
The little Dutch boy.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.049
Half Italian, half Irish.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.790
But I have been keeping
this place watertight

18:59.790 --> 19:01.183
with my own fingers for years.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.011
Why'd it take you
so long to speak up?

19:03.011 --> 19:07.407
I talked, but nobody
would listen until I sued them.

19:07.407 --> 19:11.280
Detective Bruno,
Sergeant Tutuola.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.456
I've never shook hands
with a millionaire before.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.675
How's it feel?

19:14.675 --> 19:16.198
Litigious.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.332
I hope you don't mind us
invading your space.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.116
Nah, we're not precious.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.683
It's a hell of a shiner
you got there.

19:22.683 --> 19:25.251
From those bangers you shot?

19:25.251 --> 19:27.905
More open cases?

19:27.905 --> 19:29.429
About 20 pounds' worth.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.908
Where do you wanna start?

19:34.260 --> 19:36.436
What's the one case
that keeps you up at night?

19:36.436 --> 19:38.002
You're not gonna like it.

19:38.002 --> 19:38.873
Why not?

19:38.873 --> 19:41.615
'Cause it's closed.

19:41.615 --> 19:46.750
If you ask me,
the wrong guy's locked up.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.665
Six young girls
over two years,

19:48.665 --> 19:50.667
all attacked on their way
home from St. Genevieve.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.886
The deaf school?

19:51.886 --> 19:53.235
Knocked out with one punch,

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
then dragged
into a private area and raped.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.545
Well, against my better
judgment, I'm interested.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.503
Their stories are consistent,

20:00.503 --> 20:02.201
but no one
would listen to them.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.550
Yeah, I'm sensing the theme, Bruno.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.116
Yeah. I know how they feel.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.250
Well, you said the stories
are consistent.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.035
Did you have a translator,
somebody who knew ASL?

20:11.035 --> 20:13.081
We put in the request,
but no one ever showed.

20:13.081 --> 20:16.563
These weren't classified
as a serial

20:16.563 --> 20:17.999
until someone made a collar.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.219
Local hump named Pup Peters.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.916
We could connect him
to the last victim,

20:21.916 --> 20:23.918
but I think my captain
just used him to wipe

20:23.918 --> 20:25.311
the other five off the board.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.966
And you're sure they put
the wrong man in prison?

20:28.966 --> 20:30.751
Yeah.

20:30.751 --> 20:33.101
There were more rapes
in the area, the same MO.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.407
And my captain,
he just ignored them

20:34.407 --> 20:36.322
because we already
had a perp behind bars.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.454
So I kept pushing and pushing.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.587
Until they fired you.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.815
Well, the first step
is to re-interview

20:51.815 --> 20:53.643
any of these victims
that will talk to us

20:53.643 --> 20:55.602
with somebody
who is fluent in ASL,

20:55.602 --> 20:57.604
and preferably a woman.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.084
You have someone in mind?

21:00.084 --> 21:02.957
I do.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.351
Hey, how are you?
I heard what happened.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.744
Well, at least I'm upright.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.572
Thank you, Kate, for coming in.

21:09.572 --> 21:10.791
Yeah, of course.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.314
I'm not your only
resource here, right?

21:12.314 --> 21:13.402
Well--

21:13.402 --> 21:14.447
And you called
for an interpreter?

21:14.447 --> 21:15.883
I put in a request.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.363
Right, and they told you
it was gonna take a week?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.017
And we just don't
have that kind of time.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.106
So these women have
been waiting ten years.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.369
Right.

21:23.369 --> 21:27.938
How about we start
with what you remember

21:27.938 --> 21:29.984
about the day of the attack?

21:32.465 --> 21:35.163
I noticed him
when I got off the bus.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.122
- Okay.
- He was following me, so I--

21:38.122 --> 21:40.429
I just started walking fast.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.476
Okay. Did he say anything?

21:43.476 --> 21:45.608
No.

21:45.608 --> 21:49.917
He just--he just
kept following me.

21:49.917 --> 21:55.444
So I went into the park,
and then I remember I felt--

21:55.444 --> 22:00.101
I just felt this punch,
right on the side of my head.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.192
Hey.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.544
It's okay.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.154
Take your time.

22:14.202 --> 22:16.770
When it was over,
I went to find a police officer

22:16.770 --> 22:18.989
and ask for help.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.295
What happened next?

22:22.993 --> 22:25.518
I signed help me,
but he misunderstood it

22:25.518 --> 22:29.304
and thought I pulled out
a gun and he drew down.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.827
At her?

22:32.873 --> 22:35.745
Well, she's lucky
she didn't get shot.

22:35.745 --> 22:38.226
Did Bronx SVU even
interview her?

22:42.970 --> 22:45.015
I was handcuffed,
behind my back.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.800
I couldn't sign
anything at all.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.550
The lieutenant in charge
of my case,

22:57.550 --> 22:59.900
he didn't understand me.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.859
He said if I couldn't
communicate with him,

23:02.859 --> 23:05.906
how am I supposed to
communicate with a judge?

23:05.906 --> 23:08.169
Okay.
Did you have a rape kit done?

23:11.825 --> 23:13.087
Yeah.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.002
He finished it,
but the lieutenant,

23:15.002 --> 23:17.004
he never even
told me the results.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.832
Never. Nothing.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.149
How's your relationship
with this lieutenant?

23:32.149 --> 23:34.456
I got him fired.
How do you think?

23:41.332 --> 23:43.247
What's with the third degree?

23:43.247 --> 23:45.206
I already told
the DOJ everything

23:45.206 --> 23:46.947
I knew in my exit interview.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.471
We're not
with the DOJ, Lieutenant.

23:49.471 --> 23:53.040
We're just fellow SVU cops,
curious about what became

23:53.040 --> 23:55.825
of rape kits
in a possible serial.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.174
What do you think?

23:57.174 --> 23:59.046
They went to the lab.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.657
And I might be old,
but I'm not stupid.

24:01.657 --> 24:05.531
You're here to piss in my beer.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.967
Bruno put you up to this?

24:06.967 --> 24:08.490
What makes you think that?

24:08.490 --> 24:11.232
He didn't care about victims
till he smelled a payday.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.322
Bruno's lawsuit
does not concern us.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.933
Who is he gonna sue next, you?

24:18.848 --> 24:19.980
How about you?

24:19.980 --> 24:22.983
Back to the rape kits.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.507
We got our guy
the old-fashioned way.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.554
Okay, so how'd you know
Pup Peters was good for it?

24:28.554 --> 24:31.513
He was known to the victim,
placed in the area,

24:31.513 --> 24:33.341
made a full confession.

24:33.341 --> 24:36.170
I don't know what that means
in Manhattan,

24:36.170 --> 24:39.869
but in the Bronx,
it means a conviction.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.748
That wasn't
a real confession.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.314
I didn't touch those girls.

24:50.314 --> 24:51.751
I kept trying to tell them.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.970
Well, why did they pick
you up in the first place?

24:53.970 --> 24:56.016
Deaf girl's mother
just up and dimed me out

24:56.016 --> 24:57.626
to get out
of some bogus drug charge.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.759
But you admit
you shot up with her?

24:59.759 --> 25:01.891
Yeah. I fixed with her.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.458
We'd party all night.

25:03.458 --> 25:07.897
One time, I told her Cee-Cee
was pretty, for a mute.

25:09.377 --> 25:10.639
Okay.

25:10.639 --> 25:12.336
Did you have sex with the girl?

25:12.336 --> 25:13.599
No.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.905
Hell, I was just being nice.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.342
Yeah, a real sweet talker.

25:18.342 --> 25:21.389
Look, my sheet might be long,
but my heart is clean.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.260
I only ever robbed
drug dealers.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.871
I don't mess with no kids.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.612
That's for damn sure.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.875
And what happened
after you were arrested?

25:28.875 --> 25:32.531
They put me in a box,
kept asking me why I did it.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.141
It went on for hours.

25:34.141 --> 25:37.536
I started going
into withdrawal, real bad.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.321
- Didn't ask for a lawyer?
- Didn't have to.

25:40.321 --> 25:43.367
They gave me a piece of paper,
said if I signed, I could fix.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.588
So I signed, and shot up
right there on the spot.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.985
Look, you gonna get me
out of here or not?

25:51.985 --> 25:53.595
We're working on it.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.601
DA is never gonna let him out
unless we find another suspect.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.168
We?

26:01.168 --> 26:02.996
You could be on a beach
in Bali.

26:02.996 --> 26:05.651
I'm not leaving
till this one's fixed.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.870
Everything all right?
- Everything?

26:07.870 --> 26:09.306
How about nothing?

26:09.306 --> 26:10.612
And just when I thought
we were starting

26:10.612 --> 26:11.918
to understand each other.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.093
Under no circumstances
were you

26:13.093 --> 26:14.485
to interfere with our work.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.617
I haven't.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.532
The deaf school case
is closed.

26:17.532 --> 26:20.230
You were only supposed
to assist the Bronx SVU

26:20.230 --> 26:21.884
with uncleared cases.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.233
It's hard enough
for us to wade

26:23.233 --> 26:24.713
through their
gross incompetence

26:24.713 --> 26:26.933
without you adding
to the depth of the pile.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.326
Pup Peter's confession
was coerced.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.590
It's not your job
to make that determination,

26:31.590 --> 26:33.243
it's the DOJ's.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.289
All right, this ends now.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.465
I am ordering you
to move on to another case

26:37.465 --> 26:38.858
or get your people
out of the Bronx.

26:38.858 --> 26:39.989
Is that understood?

26:42.905 --> 26:44.559
Copy that, Chief.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.958
Hey.
- Benson. It's me, Bruno.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.307
You need to drop
what you're doing

26:53.307 --> 26:55.004
<i>and meet me
at Willis and 141st.</i>

26:55.004 --> 26:57.616
Look, the Feds
called McGrath.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.965
I just got spanked.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.227
They said we can't
work closed cases.

27:00.227 --> 27:03.360
We got another victim,
a deaf girl.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.101
He's still out there.

27:05.101 --> 27:07.669
And he's leveling up.
This one's dead.

27:18.854 --> 27:22.858
Renee Perry, 14 years old,
sophomore at St. Genevieve's.

27:22.858 --> 27:25.208
Residents found her in the lot,
tights around her ankles,

27:25.208 --> 27:27.602
called the local precinct.
- Any witnesses?

27:27.602 --> 27:29.909
No, we're canvassing,
but, uh...

27:29.909 --> 27:32.738
Folks up here
don't like talking to cops.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.217
Detective, Captain.

27:34.217 --> 27:37.090
Well, I hope you're paying
attention now because--

27:37.090 --> 27:39.092
I'd exercise caution
before finishing that sentence.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.007
Because we have a serial
on the loose.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.661
It's been ten years
since the last attack.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.749
No, it hasn't.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.446
Pup Peters is rotting in jail.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.361
The real rapist has
always been out there.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.232
So there were
other deaf victims?

27:49.232 --> 27:50.712
What do you think
I got fired about?

27:50.712 --> 27:52.366
Any of them killed?

27:52.366 --> 27:54.498
If someone had listened
to me, or those deaf girls,

27:54.498 --> 27:56.544
she'd still be alive.

27:56.544 --> 27:57.980
We didn't botch
the investigation.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.852
No, no, you're just
botching the cleanup.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.810
All right,
just walk it off, all right?

28:06.597 --> 28:08.164
You can say
what you want about him,

28:08.164 --> 28:12.865
but his message is giving
a voice to the voiceless.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.388
I know how he feels.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.173
Solving this one would send
a signal to the community

28:17.173 --> 28:19.436
that Bronx SVU's
finally listening.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.963
Given the circumstances,
I have no objection

28:23.963 --> 28:26.487
to you staying on this case.

28:26.487 --> 28:27.749
Thank you.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.272
Appreciate that.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.323
What is that worried face?

28:36.323 --> 28:38.281
A ten-year-old case.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.414
Now we gotta solve it.

28:43.330 --> 28:44.897
That poor baby.

28:44.897 --> 28:51.512
I--I mostly just walk her home,
and I wasn't there.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.775
Was it quick?

28:53.775 --> 28:56.169
No please, please.
Just--just tell me.

28:56.169 --> 28:59.520
The ME said the cause of
death was blunt force trauma.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.262
She didn't see or feel a thing.

29:02.262 --> 29:05.874
Were you aware of the other
St. Genevieve students that--

29:05.874 --> 29:07.441
that were attacked?

29:07.441 --> 29:10.357
I asked the administration
when Renee first started.

29:10.357 --> 29:13.708
I--I remember what happened
to those other girls

29:13.708 --> 29:15.623
when I was around her age.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.973
What'd they say about it?

29:17.973 --> 29:19.888
That they caught someone.

29:25.502 --> 29:26.590
We understand.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.811
We're so incredibly sorry.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.684
She would have been safe

29:33.684 --> 29:36.862
if I had been there
to walk her out.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.907
If this happened to my child--

29:46.785 --> 29:47.829
Yeah, all right.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.352
Thanks, Junior.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.267
Lab pulled DNA
from Renee Perry's body.

29:51.267 --> 29:52.616
- That's good news.
- Great.

29:52.616 --> 29:53.835
Have the lab put a rush on it.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.315
Well, it'll take
at least a few weeks.

29:55.315 --> 29:56.882
We don't have
that kind of time.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.318
With our killer
still on the loose?

29:58.318 --> 29:59.623
All right, grab your coat.
Let's go.

29:59.623 --> 30:03.671
- Where are we going?
- To help motivate them.

30:03.671 --> 30:04.803
See you.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.895
As I already explained,
our backlog is long.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.287
I can't prioritize testing.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.898
All right, so--

30:12.898 --> 30:14.943
Eddie, is it?

30:14.943 --> 30:17.511
Look, I understand
there's a protocol, right?

30:17.511 --> 30:22.255
But all we need is the DNA
from Renee Perry's autopsy

30:22.255 --> 30:24.997
to be run a little quicker
than normal.

30:24.997 --> 30:28.000
I am not authorized to
unilaterally make that happen.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.436
But you understand
that we're trying

30:29.436 --> 30:32.004
to track a serial rapist?

30:32.004 --> 30:35.137
And I'd like to help,
but the gears of bureaucracy

30:35.137 --> 30:37.009
don't grind any faster
just because you

30:37.009 --> 30:39.098
batted your eyelashes at me.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.406
Hey, Eddie.

30:43.406 --> 30:44.886
That's a nice watch.

30:44.886 --> 30:48.063
Oh, it's just a Seiko.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.936
My wife teases because
every phone's got a clock,

30:50.936 --> 30:52.285
but it never comes
off my wrist.

30:52.285 --> 30:56.724
Nonetheless,
a fellow horologist.

30:56.724 --> 30:59.683
You know what that is,
don't you?

30:59.683 --> 31:00.859
A Patek.

31:02.512 --> 31:03.949
Is that real?

31:03.949 --> 31:06.908
I splurged a little
after my settlement.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.041
Got this and a couple
of Sea-Doos.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.176
It's yours,
if you rush that DNA.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.924
- You can't do that.
- Because it's bribery?

31:22.924 --> 31:26.145
Because I'm a police captain.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.886
But it worked, didn't it?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.933
- Muncy.
- Captain, we found the kid.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.369
The one you shot.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.110
- He's still alive?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

31:35.110 --> 31:36.807
A few of his buddies dumped him
in some basement

31:36.807 --> 31:37.983
up in Tremont.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.332
He's septic, 104 fever.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.812
So make sure that
he gets to Knickerbocker.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.684
EMT says your bullet's
in his leg.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.120
About to have surgery.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.600
Well, let me know
when he's out.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.557
I wanna talk to him.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.087
Duarte found your banger.
Is he gonna make it?

31:55.087 --> 31:56.262
He's been in surgery
all night.

31:56.262 --> 31:59.482
They're trying to remove
my bullet from his knee.

31:59.482 --> 32:02.007
So what's your plan
once he comes to?

32:02.007 --> 32:04.357
When BX9 finds out
he's in custody,

32:04.357 --> 32:05.706
they're gonna come for him.

32:05.706 --> 32:08.274
I have Muncy and Velasco
on security detail,

32:08.274 --> 32:10.711
and I'm liaising with Duarte.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.234
Good news.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.496
I got a call from Fuentes.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.976
The DNA on Renee's body

32:14.976 --> 32:16.282
was a match to some
of the rapes

32:16.282 --> 32:18.066
from ten years ago.
- Was he in the system?

32:18.066 --> 32:21.417
No, but Fuentes was so
enamored with my Patek,

32:21.417 --> 32:22.853
he processed another sample

32:22.853 --> 32:24.594
and uploaded it
to a genealogy site.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.988
- And?
- He found a familial hit.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.990
A half-brother in Park Chester.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.426
I'll send Churlish
to go pick him up.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.124
Fantastic.

32:32.124 --> 32:35.170
I'm telling you,
I don't have a half-brother.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.825
It's just me,
my sister Diane in Orlando,

32:37.825 --> 32:40.262
and Amy in Hoboken.

32:40.262 --> 32:41.698
Go ahead, call them right now.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.178
We don't wanna
talk to your sisters.

32:43.178 --> 32:46.616
We wanna talk to whoever
raped these six girls...

32:48.836 --> 32:50.272
And killed this girl, Renee.

32:50.272 --> 32:53.493
She was only 14 years old.

32:53.493 --> 32:56.844
All of these school girls
were deaf, vulnerable.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.977
They couldn't even hear
the footsteps behind them.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.719
I'm a CPA.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.287
I garden,
do puzzles with my wife.

33:05.287 --> 33:08.334
I don't know anyone who
could do something like that.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.466
Yeah, well, we do,
and DNA doesn't lie.

33:10.466 --> 33:11.467
Your brother did this.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.860
Dear God.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.035
And if you keep
protecting him,

33:14.035 --> 33:16.559
we're gonna charge you
as an accessory.

33:16.559 --> 33:20.563
I don't know what's going on,
but I swear to you,

33:20.563 --> 33:22.217
I don't have a brother.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.177
Then who were you looking
for with that ancestry kit?

33:25.177 --> 33:27.875
My wife gave that
to me for my birthday.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.269
She told me they didn't
find any relatives.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.709
Ancestry site screwed up.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.406
Or the lab?

33:37.406 --> 33:39.234
I want my watch back.

33:41.323 --> 33:42.455
Fin's right.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.066
DNA doesn't lie.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.807
So the wife did.

33:50.289 --> 33:52.378
When are you
going to release my husband?

33:52.378 --> 33:53.727
He's completely innocent.

33:53.727 --> 33:57.513
He may be, but we need
to find his half-brother.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.994
- He doesn't have a brother.
- Mrs. Little, we know.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.865
And we know that you know.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.868
Alan told us about
the ancestry site.

34:04.868 --> 34:08.002
The question is,
how did you get the results?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.441
Look, you have to talk to me.

34:12.441 --> 34:15.009
This is a murder investigation.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.188
Okay, okay.

34:27.543 --> 34:29.284
I was curious.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.591
I opened his email
before he did.

34:31.591 --> 34:32.766
Okay.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.985
And you read it,
and what did it say?

34:34.985 --> 34:38.076
On his family tree,
under parents,

34:38.076 --> 34:40.817
were the names of two people
I'd never heard of.

34:40.817 --> 34:43.516
I thought it had
to be a mistake.

34:43.516 --> 34:47.259
So I emailed the woman
listed as his mother.

34:47.259 --> 34:51.001
And she let you in
on her secret?

34:51.001 --> 34:53.917
Alan's birth mother
had an affair,

34:53.917 --> 34:57.225
put Alan up for adoption.

34:57.225 --> 35:01.142
And you decided not
to tell your husband?

35:01.142 --> 35:06.147
Alan thinks his adopted
parents are his real parents.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.453
Okay.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.629
I love my family,
I don't want them hurt.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.021
I understand.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.546
And we will do everything
we can to protect

35:13.546 --> 35:15.156
your family's secret.

35:15.156 --> 35:17.115
But we need
to catch this rapist

35:17.115 --> 35:19.291
before he hurts another girl.

35:27.603 --> 35:32.042
My husband forced me to give
up Alan to save our marriage.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.090
Did you have another son?

35:38.310 --> 35:40.529
Yeah, Ronnie.

35:40.529 --> 35:44.707
We've just had nothing
but conflict and issues.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.927
Can I ask about the issues?

35:50.931 --> 35:54.543
Just a lot of anger
between us both.

35:54.543 --> 36:01.159
I really tried my best, but we
just never really got along.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.425
Where is Ronnie now?

36:11.952 --> 36:13.910
- Ronnie Samuels.
- NYPD.

36:13.910 --> 36:15.608
I didn't do anything.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.000
- Whoa!
- Drop it!

36:17.000 --> 36:19.220
Drop the gun, Ronnie.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.395
Ronnie.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.358
Don't shoot?

36:26.358 --> 36:29.012
Now you're protecting me?
- Ronnie, Ronnie.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.318
You told them I was here?

36:30.318 --> 36:32.668
Ronnie, Ronnie.
Listen to me.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.236
I need you
to give me the gun, okay?

36:35.236 --> 36:37.586
Okay.
Drop the gun, there we go.

36:37.586 --> 36:38.587
There you go. Give me the gun.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.241
There we go.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.743
You're done, Ronnie.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.310
We can connect you
to Renee's murder

37:05.310 --> 37:06.702
and three of the rape vics.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.270
DNA, and all three
picked you out of a lineup.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.837
What are you offering?

37:10.837 --> 37:12.795
A chance for your client
to tell his side of the story

37:12.795 --> 37:14.841
and answer some
of our questions.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.452
And if we like
what he has to say,

37:17.452 --> 37:20.368
we tell the DA he cooperated.

37:23.371 --> 37:24.677
Why deaf girls?

37:24.677 --> 37:26.592
You met my mother.

37:26.592 --> 37:29.551
Why do you think?

37:29.551 --> 37:31.684
It's pretty Freudian,
isn't it?

37:31.684 --> 37:37.951
I want to hurt her,
but I can't.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.257
That's it?

37:42.172 --> 37:44.305
You don't listen very well.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.220
I just confessed.

37:46.220 --> 37:49.223
I wanna hear it.

37:49.223 --> 37:52.618
These girls--

37:52.618 --> 37:57.405
Logan Camacho,
Rose Salazar, Moreno West.

37:57.405 --> 37:58.972
They were victimized.

37:58.972 --> 38:02.367
We didn't listen,
and that's on us.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.456
But their rapes?

38:04.456 --> 38:06.545
That's on you.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.895
And Renee.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.592
She can't even speak
at all anymore.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.333
That wasn't
supposed to happen.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.813
She--she just hit her head.

38:13.813 --> 38:17.512
I wanna hear you say it!

38:17.512 --> 38:20.602
I raped them all.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.954
Are we satisfied now?

38:24.954 --> 38:26.434
No.

38:26.434 --> 38:29.132
Not until he writes it up
and signs it.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.184
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.190
Can we get out
of the Bronx now?

38:43.190 --> 38:44.583
No chance, Fin.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.324
We have all those cases
in there.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.151
Yeah, a whole wall of them.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.544
Which is your problem now.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.286
You, Bruno, and Churlish.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.983
That's not gonna be enough.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.116
There's only one way
to put out a fire like this.

38:56.116 --> 39:00.555
Yeah, exactly, which is
to toss more bodies at it.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.123
And SVU Bronx
needs a new squad now.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.386
I don't have the authority
to hire anybody.

39:05.386 --> 39:09.521
Right, but you and Bruno
should be vetting them

39:09.521 --> 39:11.871
for 1PP and the Feds.

39:11.871 --> 39:15.788
While you go
after Oscar Papa?

39:15.788 --> 39:17.790
It's the reason that
I came up here, isn't it?

39:21.010 --> 39:22.969
How much time you think
they're gonna give Ronnie?

39:22.969 --> 39:25.972
Seven counts for rape one,
one count for murder two.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.669
He'll spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.454
Which means Pup Peter's
rape conviction

39:29.454 --> 39:30.542
will get overturned too.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.021
And he'll probably sue.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.849
Just like
our friend in there.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.938
Yeah, and if it keeps
going on like this,

39:35.938 --> 39:37.897
the city is gonna go broke.

39:39.855 --> 39:42.031
The kid that I shot
just got out of surgery.

39:47.036 --> 39:50.170
Oh, I'm so glad you're
having such a good time, Noah.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.651
<i>Yeah, me and Connor
stayed up all night.</i>

39:52.651 --> 39:54.000
<i>We had ice cream,</i>

39:54.000 --> 39:56.045
<i>and we almost beat
"Red Dead Redemption."</i>

39:56.045 --> 39:59.222
Well, it sounds like you're
not ready to come home, huh?

39:59.222 --> 40:01.442
<i>No, but I miss you.</i>

40:01.442 --> 40:03.923
Oh, honey, I miss you too.
So much.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.664
<i>Did you get
those bad guys yet?</i>

40:05.664 --> 40:07.927
Oh, I'm still
working on that.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.799
But it sounds like you're
getting a lot of bad guys.

40:12.627 --> 40:16.283
Oh, sweetie, I gotta go.

40:16.283 --> 40:19.460
Listen, don't--don't stay up
all night again, okay?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.375
All right?
I'll call you tomorrow.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.724
<i>Love you.</i>

40:22.724 --> 40:24.030
Love you too.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.034
Kid's still groggy.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.601
Might be a good time
to talk to him.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.561
How's he doing?

40:33.561 --> 40:35.650
He's gonna need a new knee.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.522
Better than being dead
in a basement somewhere.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.872
He needs better friends.

40:39.872 --> 40:43.005
Well, he's about to get one.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.274
Remember me?
