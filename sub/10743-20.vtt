21:16.141 --> 21:19.043
TONY:
I've never
done that before, sir.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.978
           Believe me, there's
         nothing to worry about.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.713
        Now, as you were saying,
              Major Healey?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.815
     We had these two bottles--
I feel awfully faint.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.283
   Do you have any water?
 Of course.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.218
Maybe something for a headache.
                      Of course.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.455
           You stay right there.
  Thank you. Thank you.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.457
               You just won
             the Academy Award.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.097
Here we are.
Here we are, Major Nelson.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.165
       Oh, thank you, sir.
   It's more than kind of you.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.468
      A little water?
   Easy.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.836
             Easy.
I'll take that, Amanda.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.504
             You're too kind,
              Mrs. Bellows.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.407
Oh, why, it's a very lucky thing
we arrived when we did.

21:50.409 --> 21:52.209
                     Yeah, we're
                          lucky.
    How's your headache?

21:52.211 --> 21:53.276
            Oh, fine, it's--

21:53.278 --> 21:54.778
             I think it's
            getting better.

21:54.780 --> 21:55.980
           I-I ought to be
             leaving now.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.581
            I'm sorry to have
           intruded like this.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.483
You brought the copy
to exchange.
             Yes, sir.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.819
Let's exchange it.
       We don't have to tonight.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.087
Well, of course, tonight!

22:03.089 --> 22:05.255
Otherwise, you'll be walking
in your sleep again.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.824
And the next time
you might get shot.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.358
Now, there you are, major.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.227
Your problems
are all over.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.671
You'd better get to bed now.
You've been through a lot.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.439
              A lot, sir.
   We've all been through a lot.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.441
                 I'll take this.
Now...major--

22:24.443 --> 22:26.309
       I don't mind keeping this
           till the evening.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.778
No, it's all settled.
               Alfred?

22:27.780 --> 22:30.848
        You know, I am sorry
    I started this whole thing.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.949
              [CHUCKLES]

22:31.951 --> 22:33.851
          Major, I should've
           taken the couch.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.152
                  The couch?
                   Oh, yes.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.721
                 The flowers are
                         theirs.
         Oh, I'm sorry.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.190
Now, major,
everything is all set.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.660
All you have to do is relax.
   TONY: I'm terribly sorry.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.928
And then you get
a good night's rest.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.496
            TONY:
But wouldn't you like that--?

22:46.498 --> 22:47.765
        A good night's
         rest, major.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.533
           Uh-uh. Uh.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.234
          Good night.

22:51.236 --> 22:52.269
                      [LAUGHING]
                       Alfred...

22:52.271 --> 22:54.104
           Oh.
                 ...is he always
                    like that?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.739
        Oh, no.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.374
   This is one of
   his good days.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.441
                     Ooh?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.280
 Roger, do me a favor,
       will you?

23:03.282 --> 23:04.815
             Tomorrow morning,
              call your uncle

23:04.817 --> 23:06.116
              in the real estate
                   business.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.785
                 Ask if he's got
                  any openings.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.621
            What are you so
         worried about, anyway?

23:10.623 --> 23:12.289
What am I worried--?
Give me that.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.724
              Careful.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.226
           Ah. Be careful.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.895
  You have any idea
   what's going on

23:17.897 --> 23:19.597
 at Doctor Bellows'
  house right now?

23:19.599 --> 23:20.965
               No. What?

23:20.967 --> 23:23.601
Mrs. Bellows is opening
that package.

23:23.603 --> 23:27.437
And right about now, she's...
opening the bottle.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.807
And you know what's
coming out of the bottle?

23:29.809 --> 23:31.375
       Smoke.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.811
And do you know what that
smoke is turning into?

23:37.216 --> 23:39.216
 Jeannie. That's what
 it's gonna turn into.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.918
        J-Jeannie?!
Master!

23:40.920 --> 23:42.085
  [BOTH LAUGHING]

23:42.087 --> 23:44.087
  Hey. How did you get here?
I do not know.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.390
      Well, the old mastermind
    decided we needed a miracle,

23:46.392 --> 23:49.059
       so when you were talking,
        I switched the bottles.

23:49.061 --> 23:52.195
    Oh, Major Healey. Thank you!
             Well...

23:52.197 --> 23:53.597
                       Oh.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.099
               Oh!

23:56.101 --> 23:57.668
           Oh, oh, oh.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.903
          My own bottle!

23:58.905 --> 24:00.404
                      Oh. And
                   my own genie.

24:00.406 --> 24:01.972
   Oh, you shouldn't
   have. Ho-ho-ho.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.074
    You know better than to
   give Roger his own bottle,

24:04.076 --> 24:05.209
    much less his own genie.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.777
                      Open it.
        Oh.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.878

24:07.880 --> 24:09.846

       Oh. Oh-ho-ho!
           Whoo!

24:09.848 --> 24:11.982
            Oh! It's
            champagne.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.617
Oh. Thank you.
                Mm.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.119
         Well, at least
      we got Jeannie back.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.521
    I guess we might as well
        drink to it. Oh.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.089
     Is that really champagne?
 Sure is.
