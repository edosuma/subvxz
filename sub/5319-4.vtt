verge of getting suspended.

it from his best friend.

Okay.

So you start with the weeds,
and you can't just pull 'em.

08:18.470 --> 08:21.820
You got to spray, and
make sure they're dead.

08:21.870 --> 08:23.560
Then the seed. Then fertilizer.

08:23.610 --> 08:27.830
If you don't have fertilizer,
you will not have a lawn.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.630
You don't have fertilizer.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.100
No.

08:31.150 --> 08:32.630
We're gonna have to wrap this up

08:32.679 --> 08:33.870
so I can go talk to Julio.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.299
All right.

08:35.350 --> 08:37.039
All right, this'll make
the seeds grow faster,

08:37.090 --> 08:38.740
and it'll keep the birds out.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.470
Birds don't like shit.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.909

Oh, we don't have anything yet, sir.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.950
All right, I'm gonna say this twice

08:52.000 --> 08:53.320
because people don't listen.

08:53.370 --> 08:55.490
Water twice a day for the first two weeks.

08:55.540 --> 08:58.720
Water twice a day for the
first two weeks. You got that?

08:58.770 --> 09:00.090
- Yes.
- Because you can do

09:00.140 --> 09:01.900
everything else right,
and if you don't water

09:01.950 --> 09:04.060
like I just said, you will not have a lawn.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.530

ring you out over there.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.670
All right. Appreciate it.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.240
Mm-hmm.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.670
You raised a good one there.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.310
Oh, he's not my son.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.640
Oh.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.580
Well, he's got a good heart.

09:20.630 --> 09:23.250
I can tell.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.590
Gilbert.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.890
Good news.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.790
We found emesis on Shane's body.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.990
What's "emesis?"

09:32.040 --> 09:33.730
It's a medical term for vomit.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.330
You're showing me a bag of vomit?

09:35.380 --> 09:38.260
Emesis. We can extract DNA from it.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.500
It's not as fast or
reliable as blood or saliva,

09:40.550 --> 09:42.340
but it can be done, and
I'm betting this belongs

09:42.390 --> 09:45.410
to Keith Dennison and not Julio Farkas.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.770
How long?

09:46.820 --> 09:47.910
Two weeks.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.510
We still have eyes on Dennison?

09:49.560 --> 09:52.110
Judge McKnight knows we have
a body and suspect in custody.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.310
She won't approve any more surveillance.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.280
So you're holding a bag of vomit

09:55.330 --> 09:57.850
which may or may not be Keith Dennison's,

09:57.900 --> 09:57.920
which may or may not be Keith Dennison's,
and it might not matter if it is

09:57.970 --> 09:59.190
and it might not matter if it is

09:59.240 --> 10:01.290
because thanks to Pernell Harris,

10:01.340 --> 10:05.590
Dennison is a free man doing
God knows what to God knows who.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.360
You have a very loose
definition of good news.

10:33.340 --> 10:36.390
Where are they taking Farkas?

10:36.440 --> 10:37.420
Room eight.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.320
Is he alone?

10:38.370 --> 10:40.390
Yes, sir. He's in restraints.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.460
He's up second, though, so better be quick.

10:42.510 --> 10:43.760
Thanks, Andrews.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.070
Shit.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.510
Sorry, Pernell, can't
pretend you don't see me.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.270
Gilbert, hey. How are you?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.210
Oh, so we're playing
like everything's fine?

10:56.260 --> 10:58.510
I'm great, and how are you, Judge Harris?

10:58.560 --> 11:02.520
Gilbert, can we just bury the hatchet?

11:02.570 --> 11:05.750
It never should have got to this point.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.790
I'm sorry.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.990
And now the blanket apology.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.290
Am I just some schmuck to you?

11:11.340 --> 11:13.160
Gilbert, look, I can't do this now.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.360
How about at the hearing I give you

11:14.410 --> 11:16.360
a full performance from the heart.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.400
It's gonna be too late at the hearing.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.000
I'll come see you at your
office this afternoon.

11:20.050 --> 11:21.470
What's wrong with right here, right now?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.200
Gilbert, I'm having bladder issues,

11:23.250 --> 11:25.010
and I really don't want
to piss all over myself.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.210
If you want to, you can
come with me to the bathroom.

11:27.260 --> 11:31.110
Uh, the bathroom's that way.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.750
See? You do still care.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.600
[door closes]

12:00.420 --> 12:03.380
Just got the list of attendees
for the eminent domain powwow.

12:03.430 --> 12:05.150
Okay, who's on the firing squad?

12:05.200 --> 12:08.280
Councilmen Sacks and
Hughes, Councilwoman Wells,

12:08.330 --> 12:11.380
some dude from ACLU, a HUD rep,

12:11.430 --> 12:13.190
Lorraine... what's her name, from ARC?

12:13.240 --> 12:14.920
- Frankel.
- Yeah, and the President

12:14.970 --> 12:17.260
of the East San Vicente
Neighborhood Association.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.360
That's it? Nobody from Greenpeace?

12:19.410 --> 12:21.190
You kicking everybody out their houses.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
Relocate. Relocate.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.800
Fucking get the nomenclature right, Asa.

12:29.450 --> 12:31.170
- Hi, Robert.
- Hold on.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.110
Where's your team?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.980
I'm here. Who else do you need?

12:36.030 --> 12:39.410
Oh, I don't know, Guy? Mr. Brooks?

12:39.460 --> 12:41.510
We're about to sit down with the
community activist all-star team

12:41.560 --> 12:43.080
and try to convince them it's okay

12:43.130 --> 12:44.780
to kick people out their houses.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.720
Relocate.

12:46.770 --> 12:47.890
Relocate people.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.090
Because Brooks is the best thing to happen

12:50.140 --> 12:52.290
to San Vicente since me,

12:52.340 --> 12:54.930
and all your bosses can do
is trot out a pretty face

12:54.980 --> 12:57.230
from the PR department.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.300
Mayor Boston, I have a PPE degree

12:59.350 --> 13:00.800
from Balliol College, Oxford.

13:00.850 --> 13:02.470
Yeah, I don't care
where you went to school.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.400
Well, I'm Senior VP of Communications

13:04.450 --> 13:07.210
for Brooks Innovations.
You're in good hands.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.180
I'm in second-string hands.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.010
Folks are gonna doubt just how committed

13:11.060 --> 13:13.280
Brooks is to this city.

13:13.330 --> 13:15.950
Look, when they hear from me,

13:16.000 --> 13:17.280
they'll be hearing from someone

13:17.330 --> 13:19.320
who's lived in San Vicente for a year now.

13:19.370 --> 13:21.590
I shop here. I take spin classes here.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.290
I eat at your three decent restaurants.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.330
This is my home, and I promise you

13:26.380 --> 13:28.230
I'm a bigger cheerleader for San Vicente

13:28.280 --> 13:29.500
than Nathan Brooks.

13:29.550 --> 13:31.800
If you want anyone at
this meeting, it is me.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.600
They're here, Mr. Mayor. Send them in?

13:35.650 --> 13:40.670
Yes. Rah, rah, sis boom bah.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.640
[all chattering]

13:43.690 --> 13:46.180
MAN ON TV: We gave it
to live there with him

13:46.230 --> 13:48.650
and the husband in turn to receive her.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.850
You know he's still trying
to see me every week.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.420
Sometimes twice.

13:53.470 --> 13:55.260
He's still paying full price.

13:55.310 --> 13:57.590
Sounds like hooker alimony to me.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.230
Mm-mm. He's not going anywhere.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.560
He loves being with somebody

14:01.610 --> 14:03.830
who doesn't have expectations on him.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.430
- Yes, I do.
- But you haven't had sex

14:05.480 --> 14:07.000
with him in, like, what, a month?

14:07.050 --> 14:08.530
I know how this goes.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.640
Remember my guy who owned
the Ford dealerships?

14:10.690 --> 14:13.540
Barry with the sad, little moustache.

14:13.590 --> 14:17.480
[laughs] He had this little mini-stroke,

14:17.530 --> 14:19.410
and he freaked out,
became a total health nut.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.950
Started training for a marathon

14:21.000 --> 14:23.350
and decides that fucking
me is sapping his strength.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.650
What, was he trying to
make the Olympic team?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.990
Right, but he still saw me every Friday.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.890
Only now he's paying me to
listen to his split times

14:29.940 --> 14:32.960
and talk about how he can't
piss for two days after a race.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.430
[both laughing]

14:34.480 --> 14:37.100
I wasn't mad. I was like, "Mm, easy money."

14:37.150 --> 14:38.660
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

14:38.710 --> 14:41.400
But then two months
later, he's all talked out.

14:41.450 --> 14:44.070
Well, maybe you need to improve
your conversation skills.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.610
[laughs]

14:45.660 --> 14:47.570
Bitch, you need to get back on that

14:47.620 --> 14:49.610
and remind him why you're so special.

14:49.660 --> 14:51.710
He's gonna find someone cheaper to talk to

14:51.760 --> 14:54.780
like a shrink or his wife.

14:56.570 --> 14:59.890
He's taking this Christian
trip very seriously.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.350
That's a red flag.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.120
I'm giving him time and space to do that.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.990
That's a red fucking flag, Tessie.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.360
Mm.

15:07.410 --> 15:09.090
Do you know what you sound like right now?

15:09.140 --> 15:10.500
You sound like a good friend.

15:10.550 --> 15:12.130
- [scoffs]
- You do not want to be

15:12.180 --> 15:13.800
his friend. He is your customer,

15:13.850 --> 15:17.400
your best customer, and you're a provider.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.340
You know, you got to
think like a businesswoman.

15:19.390 --> 15:21.010
[doorbell buzzing]

15:23.690 --> 15:24.980
Who's that?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.520
My brother.

15:29.570 --> 15:32.320
The receipt cannot be allowed into evidence

15:32.370 --> 15:33.590
because it's a copy.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.490
We never stipulated to its use,

15:35.540 --> 15:36.790
and the defense never served us

15:36.840 --> 15:38.860
with notice to produce the original.

15:38.910 --> 15:41.730
REDLICH: Your Honor, this is a
copy they made during discovery.

15:41.780 --> 15:45.000
Try not to let this guy drag things out.

15:45.050 --> 15:47.400
I got a chiro in 30.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.370
Mr. Redlich, would you
approach the bench, please?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.170
Judge Harris, she's just trying to buy time

15:55.220 --> 15:56.580
to shore up her case.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.410
By the letter of the law, she's right,

15:58.460 --> 16:01.480
but it could be argued

16:01.530 --> 16:04.580
that stipulation was implied
when she sent the Xerox.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.090
Then that's what I'll argue.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.420
You know what would be
even more persuasive to me?

16:11.970 --> 16:15.630
There's a murder suspect I'd
like you to take on pro bono.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.000
So... wait, you want me to what?

16:19.050 --> 16:20.200
Julio Farkas.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.300
I want you to take him on as a client.

16:22.350 --> 16:24.300
Nothing nefarious, just a chin-wag.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.370
Pro bono? My specialty's torts.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.540
I don't even do criminal.

16:27.590 --> 16:29.110
I'm not asking you to go to trial.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.210
Just say you're his attorney,
get visitor's rights,

16:32.260 --> 16:34.910
I'll take care of the rest.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.350
Deal?

16:36.400 --> 16:40.520
Um... Deal.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.560
Anything else?

16:42.610 --> 16:45.330
Yeah, go over your evidence notes 101.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.530
This was an amateur mistake.

16:48.580 --> 16:51.230
I am allowing the receipt into evidence.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.670
Since prosecution made the copy,

16:53.720 --> 16:56.470
stipulation to its
authenticity is inferred.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.870
You may proceed, Mr. Redlich.

17:04.530 --> 17:06.150
What do you mean they're kicking you out?

17:07.859 --> 17:10.349
They kicking everybody
in East San Vicente out

17:10.400 --> 17:12.220
to make way for this Brooks project.

17:12.270 --> 17:15.720
But they have to pay fair
market value for the houses.

17:15.770 --> 17:17.790
They threw a couple bucks at us,

17:17.839 --> 17:19.660
and they expect us to take the chump change

17:19.710 --> 17:21.359
and buy something in a neighborhood

17:21.410 --> 17:24.930
that costs three times as much.

17:24.980 --> 17:27.000
[laughs]

17:27.050 --> 17:28.670
What?

17:29.850 --> 17:30.800
Sorry.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.470
I'm still trying to figure out

17:32.520 --> 17:35.580
when my little brother
turned into a grown ass man,

17:35.630 --> 17:38.110
and you talk like you know something too.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.910
[sighs]

17:39.960 --> 17:43.920
Ma's talking about moving us
to San Jose with Aunt Lotte.

17:43.970 --> 17:47.620
I'm not trying to move in
the middle of my senior year.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.630
You think you could help us out?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.560
Now, you know good and
well Mom would rather

17:54.610 --> 17:57.260
live on the streets than let me help her.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.170
It's been a couple years.
Things could have changed.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.130
She know you here?

18:02.180 --> 18:04.200
'Cause ain't shit changed.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.710
So you're not even gonna try?

18:05.760 --> 18:08.710
For what? So she can spit in my face?

18:08.760 --> 18:10.980
There's nothing I can do, Khalil.

18:11.030 --> 18:11.980
Right.

18:12.030 --> 18:15.150
You know, 'cause you tried.

18:16.330 --> 18:19.050
Come on, now. Don't be like that.

18:20.770 --> 18:24.320
Look, let's get something to eat.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.830
I know you hungry. It must take, like,

18:26.880 --> 18:29.700
four steaks a day to
keep those legs growing.

18:29.750 --> 18:33.330
I'm buying. We could catch up.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.030
I'm all caught up.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.350
Okay, I have something to show you.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.850
I think it might cheer you up,

18:48.900 --> 18:52.280
but it could also be a complete disaster.

18:52.330 --> 18:55.460
Is it the "Linda Listen" video?
'cause that'll cheer me up.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.990
[chuckles] Just watch,

18:57.040 --> 18:59.760
and if it's too much,
just tell me, I'll stop it.

18:59.810 --> 19:02.160
- [laughs] Okay.
- Okay.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.230
You ready?

19:06.280 --> 19:08.070
Try to get me and not
the bush this time, okay?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.840
JOSH: Dude, it's hard to
hide and film, all right?

19:10.890 --> 19:12.910
PJ: Quit your whining
and let's get on with it.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.710
My God.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.040
I'm sorry. Too soon.

19:15.090 --> 19:16.780
- No, no, no, no, just...
- It's my bad.

19:16.830 --> 19:19.680
Please, just keep it going. Please.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.380
You sure?

19:22.430 --> 19:23.680
Do you have any idea

19:23.730 --> 19:25.650
how much I miss just hearing his voice?

19:26.900 --> 19:27.890
Okay.

19:27.940 --> 19:29.220
[chuckles]

19:29.270 --> 19:30.490
Stop bitching, please,

19:30.540 --> 19:33.490
and just see if you can get the ring.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.490
JOSH: All right.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.830
[sighs] All right.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.570
JOSH: Uh, Yeah, I think I got it.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.870
I mean, I can barely see it.

19:43.050 --> 19:44.400
Couldn't have done better than that?

19:44.450 --> 19:45.770
Come on, man, you're rich.

19:45.820 --> 19:48.370
Yeah, my family is rich. This is from me.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.810
[shuddering exhale]

19:49.860 --> 19:51.910
JOSH: All right, do... do your whole spiel

19:51.960 --> 19:54.810
so I know exactly when to pan down.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.850
I love you. Marry me. Blah, blah, blah.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.850
- [laughs]
- JOSH: Come on, for real.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.350
JOSH: Dude, you want
this to be perfect, man.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.620
[laughs] He's so silly.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.920
[both laughing]

20:04.970 --> 20:06.390
- [clears throat]
- JOSH: If she says no,

20:06.440 --> 20:08.230
it's the only shot you got.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.130
[sighs] Um...

20:11.180 --> 20:13.600
Freshman week you showed
me the way to Gilman Hall,

20:13.650 --> 20:16.070
and that was the last time I felt lost.

20:16.120 --> 20:20.910
Um, we knew each other before we met.

20:20.960 --> 20:25.180
I was walking towards you
before I took my first steps.

20:25.230 --> 20:29.780
I was calling your name
before I knew how to speak.

20:29.830 --> 20:33.250
I was loving you before
my heart could beat.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.720
[laughs]

20:34.770 --> 20:38.390
And I can't imagine a better friend, lover,

20:38.440 --> 20:44.960
and Scrabble opponent to share
the adventure of life with, so...

20:45.950 --> 20:49.230
[sobs] Look at that.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.210
Will you marry me?

20:55.360 --> 20:57.110
What do you think?

20:57.160 --> 20:59.480
JOSH: Shit, dude, I
don't want to marry you.

20:59.530 --> 21:00.880
[both laughing]

21:00.930 --> 21:02.050
Stop.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.230
More.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.900
You want more?

21:16.950 --> 21:18.100
Mm-hmm.

21:18.150 --> 21:19.700
Got a little more.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.170
Please.

21:22.220 --> 21:23.700
[chuckles]

21:28.660 --> 21:30.610
I talked to Collette.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.150
Oh, that reminds me.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.650
I thought of a precedent
for a judge releasing a felon

21:35.700 --> 21:37.950
after a plea deal's been struck.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.450
Baxter v. California, 1997, Madera County.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.160
Collette says there's no scenario

21:43.210 --> 21:44.720
where you don't get suspended.

21:44.770 --> 21:45.960
It's just a question of how long.

21:46.010 --> 21:48.360
She's a worrywart. She always has been.

21:48.410 --> 21:49.630
We'll pull this out.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.800
Not if you keep having episodes.

21:50.850 --> 21:53.100
I'm holding it together.

21:53.150 --> 21:55.640
Hmm, the last time I heard that

21:55.690 --> 21:56.840
was right before you left me hanging

21:56.890 --> 21:59.070
at that meeting with McCauley.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.640
Maybe you need a little help.

22:01.690 --> 22:03.140
I'm not seeing a shrink.

22:03.190 --> 22:04.880
Did I say "shrink"? No, I don't think

22:04.930 --> 22:07.080
I said "shrink." I'm not
talking about a shrink.

22:07.130 --> 22:09.350
I'm talking about the
miracle of modern medicine.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.180
I take a blue pill, I'm hard in a second.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.850
Then I take a yellow one just to make sure

22:13.900 --> 22:14.950
I don't have a stroke while fucking.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.390
It's a wondrous thing.

22:19.340 --> 22:21.760
She just won't take no
for an answer, will she?

22:21.810 --> 22:24.330
Crystal cares about you, so do I.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.370
Yeah, but neither of
you are willing to accept

22:26.420 --> 22:28.370
what I'm going through.

22:28.420 --> 22:31.800
Going through.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.540
Talking about the church thing.

22:33.590 --> 22:36.480
Yeah, "that church thing."

22:37.490 --> 22:39.040
Hey, man,

22:39.090 --> 22:40.750
I can't tell you not to find Jesus,

22:40.800 --> 22:42.680
but let me ask you a question.

22:42.730 --> 22:44.350
Didn't God make medicine?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.790
Just a thought.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.290
Think about it.

22:59.950 --> 23:01.770
No, you can't say she was hospitalized

23:01.820 --> 23:03.000
because of exhaustion.

23:03.050 --> 23:05.710
Everybody knows that means drugs.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.340
Same thing for dehydration.

23:12.030 --> 23:16.580
Denise, I got to go. Say
it was... female problems.

23:16.630 --> 23:19.350
I'll see you.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.250
You need to relax.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.790
And you need to back the fuck off.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.990
I'm not taking that poison.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.620
You can sic Randy on me in the morning.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.230
I'll tell her the same fucking thing.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.890
- We're just trying to help.
- No, you're not.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.860
You're trying to sedate
me so you can trot me out

23:30.910 --> 23:33.130
to Brooks like some fucking show pony.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.970
This way Bobo gets his concrete pour

23:35.020 --> 23:36.740
and you don't lose an account.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.200
Don't be so cynical.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.740
30 years, Crys. I know how we work.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.270
You use me to get all your big dreams.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.740
Today it's Brooks. Yesterday
it was your PR firm.

23:44.790 --> 23:49.050
I used my own money and found
my own investors to start CHPR.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.150
You got all your clients
off of my coattails.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.180
Bullshit.

23:52.230 --> 23:53.920
I'm fucking good at what I do.

23:53.970 --> 23:56.020
You don't even know half my client list.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.890
I'm not talking about your
mom and pop flower shop.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.360
I'm talking about your
bread and butter accounts.

24:00.410 --> 24:02.460
You think you would have
landed St. Joseph's Hospital

24:02.510 --> 24:06.030
if the Harris Estate hadn't
donated to the pediatrics wing?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.600
You closed the Chauncey Hotel account

24:07.650 --> 24:10.800
after I guaranteed 'em that
the California Bar Convention

24:10.850 --> 24:12.670
would meet there every fucking year.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.210
You better be fucking crazy,

24:14.260 --> 24:17.680
'cause otherwise, you're just an asshole.

24:17.730 --> 24:18.980
Is this part of being born again,

24:19.030 --> 24:20.810
pissing on everybody around you?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.250
No, but telling the truth is.

24:24.270 --> 24:25.420
Oh.

24:25.470 --> 24:27.490
Well, since we're being honest,

24:27.540 --> 24:31.220
we shouldn't leave out
the part about when we met.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.160
How people didn't even know your name.

24:34.210 --> 24:37.430
You were just Joseph Harris's
slightly disappointing son,

24:37.480 --> 24:40.400
a trust fund baby, a member
of the lucky sperm club.

24:40.450 --> 24:44.300
Your daddy wouldn't even
give you reins to his company.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.610
And now...

24:48.660 --> 24:52.110
you wear the ring that everybody
in San Vicente has to kiss.

24:52.160 --> 24:55.550
You think you did that all by yourself?

24:55.600 --> 24:57.250
Is that how you want
to rewrite that chapter?

24:57.300 --> 24:58.880
I don't care about any of that.

24:58.930 --> 24:59.950
All I care about's our son.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.590
Yeah, now you care about PJ.

25:05.880 --> 25:11.260
Yeah. Now I do.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.840
BOBO: Yeah, Parks Department
gave these kids the okay

25:15.890 --> 25:17.400
to have the tournament there.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.070
CITY ATTORNEY ON SPEAKER:
That's not the point.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.140
There's a noise ordinance rule in effect.

25:21.190 --> 25:22.610
WOMAN ON SPEAKER: There has to be some sort

25:22.660 --> 25:24.480
of agreement we can reach
that would satisfy...

25:24.530 --> 25:27.650
You can see almost all
of San Vicente from there.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.150
CITY ATTORNEY: From where?

25:29.200 --> 25:32.050
Nothing. Just keep it moving.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.250
You can't really see East San Vicente,

25:34.300 --> 25:37.090
but I hear it's not gonna be
around for much longer anyway.

25:37.140 --> 25:39.860
It'll be there, just...
just different, better.

25:39.910 --> 25:41.230
With Brooks coming in, there's gonna be

25:41.280 --> 25:43.460
a gaggle of techies coming to town.

25:43.510 --> 25:46.770
They need a place to
live, shop, go to cafes.

25:46.820 --> 25:49.170
East San Vicente is that place.

25:49.220 --> 25:54.010
And the folks who live there
now, they're just in the way?

25:54.060 --> 25:55.540
What are you, an undercover activist now?

25:55.590 --> 25:58.510
My mom and kid brother got
an eminent domain notice,

25:58.560 --> 26:01.710
and the money they're getting
won't pay for a storage unit.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.420
Any way to up that?

26:04.470 --> 26:06.420
[grumbles]

26:08.940 --> 26:10.260
Two months ago maybe

26:10.310 --> 26:12.020
we could have played
with the appraisal value,

26:12.070 --> 26:15.290
but now it's on the record. I'm sorry.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.760
Four neighborhoods around Brooks.

26:18.810 --> 26:21.100
You pick the poorest one to level?

26:21.150 --> 26:24.170
Look at the big picture.
Once Brooks comes to town

26:24.220 --> 26:25.910
with their tax dollars I
can start fixing things.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.940
Top of my list, low income housing.

26:27.990 --> 26:29.310
Not projects.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.380
Real neighborhoods that we can be proud of.

26:31.430 --> 26:32.510
Mm-hmm.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.910
Hey, you have to tell
yourself something, right?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.150
Come on now, Tessie. Truth is,

26:36.200 --> 26:37.950
we're in the same line of work.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.490
We both get screwed by San
Vicente's rich and powerful

26:40.540 --> 26:42.920
to see if we can have
something to show for it.

26:42.970 --> 26:45.560
No, there's a difference between us.

26:45.610 --> 26:46.830
I get paid up front.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.790
You suck a dick and hope for the best.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.100
Now, that's not...

26:50.150 --> 26:51.530
Your mama ain't crippled, is she?

26:51.580 --> 26:54.070
- Excuse me?
- Well, if she was,

26:54.120 --> 26:55.500
we could put her on
the extreme duress list.

26:55.550 --> 26:57.200
You know, like when they kick a cripple out

26:57.250 --> 26:59.370
when everything's set up for handicaps,

26:59.420 --> 27:02.510
ramps and whatnot. City
pays extra for that.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.450
My mom's got a bad hip.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.220
Thanks.

27:17.270 --> 27:20.730
Ohh. Man, this feels good.

27:20.780 --> 27:23.300
You want to talk about it?

27:23.350 --> 27:25.600
It's the last thing I want to do.

27:25.650 --> 27:26.630
Mm.

27:31.020 --> 27:34.610
We should probably pick those up for her.

27:35.790 --> 27:37.480
That's a long walk,

27:37.530 --> 27:39.240
and if you really think about it,

27:39.290 --> 27:41.010
we're doing her a favor.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.450
She'll get more exercise

27:42.500 --> 27:45.620
if she has to run back and get them.

27:45.670 --> 27:46.650
[laughs]

27:46.700 --> 27:51.620
[both laughing]

27:51.670 --> 27:54.160
Oh. [Laughs]

27:54.210 --> 27:58.000
Hey, do you ever go to church?

27:58.050 --> 28:01.030
When I had to, growing up.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.670
- Me too.
- Yeah.

28:02.720 --> 28:06.070
Christmas, Easter,

28:06.120 --> 28:10.280
but you know... did you ever believe?

28:10.330 --> 28:12.440
You ever get moved by the spirit?

28:12.490 --> 28:16.050
Mm. My folks made me go to "Ignition."

28:16.100 --> 28:18.420
That was our church's teen ministry.

28:18.470 --> 28:21.620
My friends and I would
sneak out of the sermon,

28:21.670 --> 28:24.060
hang in the basement.

28:24.110 --> 28:27.030
That was the first time
I hooked up with a girl.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.630
First time I came too.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.400
Well, that was kind of
a religious experience.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.230
[laughs]

28:34.280 --> 28:35.930
You came in a church basement?

28:35.980 --> 28:38.140
I can come pretty much anywhere.

28:38.190 --> 28:39.440
It's... It's a gift.

28:39.490 --> 28:40.910
I don't own it, you know.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.210
[laughs]

28:43.260 --> 28:47.050
Yeah, the first time I
ever came was with Pernell.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.410
It was after a Stanford/Cal game.

28:49.460 --> 28:52.520
We were driving back to Palo Alto,

28:52.570 --> 28:55.050
and there was a lot of
traffic on the freeway,

28:55.100 --> 28:57.560
so we got off at San Leandro,

28:57.610 --> 29:02.630
and next thing you know, we're
in the backseat of the car.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.830
Mm. And I just...

29:05.880 --> 29:09.170
got caught up in the moment.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.240
Or else we just found the perfect angle

29:11.290 --> 29:13.410
in the backseat of the car. [Laughs]

29:13.460 --> 29:16.280
You married the first man
who gave you an orgasm.

29:16.330 --> 29:19.540
- No, that's not why.
- [scoffs]

29:19.590 --> 29:21.180
It's a good thing your
high school boyfriend

29:21.230 --> 29:23.080
didn't know what he was doing

29:23.130 --> 29:24.520
or you'd be hanging laundry

29:24.570 --> 29:26.620
outside a mobile home in Stockton.

29:26.670 --> 29:29.190
No, he could've gone down
on me like an oboe player.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.960
I still would've gotten out of that dump.

29:31.010 --> 29:35.090
That a thing, oboe players
being good at giving head?

29:35.140 --> 29:37.500
- Is it?
- [laughs] I don't know.

29:37.550 --> 29:39.430
Well, they use their lips and their mouths.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.500
- Eh, musicians are overrated.
- Mm.

29:43.690 --> 29:45.400
[sighs]

29:48.160 --> 29:50.240
- God, I miss him.
- Mm.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.340
The old Pernell.

29:52.390 --> 29:56.280
Before all this shit with
PJ and being born again.

29:58.070 --> 30:00.220
I think I lost that man.

30:03.340 --> 30:07.660
You think you lost him or
are you giving up on him?

30:15.620 --> 30:17.840
Ever think about going back to church?

30:32.870 --> 30:34.790
[door opening]

30:34.840 --> 30:39.220
[chatter on TV]

30:39.270 --> 30:43.030
You're not coming into this house.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.530
That's fine.

30:44.580 --> 30:47.070
I heard you're getting kicked out.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.230
From who, your brother?

30:49.280 --> 30:53.070
You don't stick to anything
you promise, do you?

30:53.120 --> 30:54.810
He came looking for me.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.540
I'm just here to give you this.

30:59.590 --> 31:02.180
I already got a check from the city.

31:02.230 --> 31:04.580
This one's for another $75,000

31:04.630 --> 31:07.290
so you don't have to move to San Jose.

31:07.340 --> 31:10.190
And what did you do for that money?

31:10.240 --> 31:12.020
I asked.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.190
Judging by that fancy
car and all that jewelry,

31:15.240 --> 31:19.030
you've been doing a lot of asking.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.670
Why can't you just say thank you?

31:20.720 --> 31:23.300
Oh, you think it's something,
you walking up here,

31:23.350 --> 31:25.300
waving money in my face.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.970
All it does is remind me of what you are.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.480
You don't get that,
because you never listened.

31:30.530 --> 31:32.710
All you cared about was getting out.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.210
"I'm going to Los Angeles.
I'm going to New York."

31:35.260 --> 31:37.080
I wasn't supposed to have dreams?

31:37.130 --> 31:38.380
You wanted me to end up like you,

31:38.430 --> 31:40.590
check to check, mad at everything?

31:40.640 --> 31:43.090
I'd rather see you standing here in rags

31:43.140 --> 31:44.890
with some self-respect.

31:46.010 --> 31:47.590
I didn't ask you to come,

31:47.640 --> 31:49.660
and I don't want your money.

31:49.710 --> 31:52.530
It's not mine. It's the city's.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.740
Take it for Khalil's sake, then.

32:06.830 --> 32:09.780
Can I at least say good-bye to my brother?

32:09.830 --> 32:12.950
Did that a long time ago
when you chose the life.

32:15.540 --> 32:20.060
You put a 16-year-old
girl out on the street.

32:20.110 --> 32:23.060
I had a choice.

32:29.050 --> 32:31.740
[cell door closing]

32:42.160 --> 32:43.850
You know who I am?

32:46.440 --> 32:48.450
You know why I'm here?

32:51.340 --> 32:52.420
I didn't kill Shane.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.430
But you were working with him.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.160
Now I want to know who hired you.

32:57.210 --> 32:59.630
What?

32:59.680 --> 33:02.830
Fuck with me and I'll fuck with you.

33:02.880 --> 33:08.770
Help me and I'll show you what
a decent human being I can be.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.580
Now, I want to know about Shane.

33:13.630 --> 33:16.620
I want to know about that night,

33:16.670 --> 33:18.480
and I want to know who
were you working for.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.220
[cell door opening]

33:20.270 --> 33:23.360
