00:00.908 --> 00:03.455
Margarita on the rocks, huh? What?

00:03.528 --> 00:05.495
That's an excellent
choice, eh...

00:05.530 --> 00:07.363
(Glass shattering)

00:11.770 --> 00:12.818
Have you seen our wine list?

00:14.422 --> 00:16.789
Oh my God, what happened
to all the bottles?

00:16.825 --> 00:18.691
Danny. Pfft.

00:18.693 --> 00:20.710
I'll talk to him, man.

00:20.762 --> 00:22.779
Thank you, so much for filling in, man.

00:22.831 --> 00:24.697
I can't believe I forgot
to do the schedule again.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.633
It's all my mom's
fault she's so selfish.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.434
Had to go on her stupid honeymoon.

00:29.604 --> 00:31.454
Who's gonna wait on all these tables?

00:31.490 --> 00:32.572
- Hey.
- Riley, hey.

00:32.607 --> 00:34.474
- Perfect timing.
- Is Danny ready to go?

00:34.509 --> 00:36.426
Yes, as soon as he
finishes cooking this order.

00:36.461 --> 00:37.393
What order?

00:37.429 --> 00:39.445
Hi, thank you guys for
waiting, this is Riley.

00:39.447 --> 00:40.747
She'll be your server this evening.

00:40.799 --> 00:42.398
Push the appies.

00:42.434 --> 00:43.816
You know what, Ben?
Ben, push them yourself.

00:43.818 --> 00:46.686
All right? I passed the bar so
that I wouldn't have to work in one.

00:46.721 --> 00:48.821
Come on, dude, you've
got to get it together.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.740
I mean, Tucker's making drinks?

00:50.775 --> 00:52.692
What's next? Is Emma
working the deep fryer?

00:52.727 --> 00:54.744
You kidding? She's my
best cocktail waitress.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.564
man, finding a new manager for the bar
is going to be harder than I thought.

01:14.599 --> 01:16.599
No one included the
photo with their resume.

01:16.651 --> 01:18.518
How am I supposed to tell if she's hot?

01:19.688 --> 01:21.571
And why are you eating
everything in the house?

01:21.606 --> 01:22.605
Didn't you just eat at Riley's?

01:22.657 --> 01:24.691
That's the problem.
She's a horrible cook.

01:24.693 --> 01:27.527
Oh. I know.

01:27.579 --> 01:28.695
She make you one of her meat waffles?

01:30.532 --> 01:31.698
Yeah. I didn't know it was possible

01:31.700 --> 01:33.583
for something to be both overcooked

01:33.618 --> 01:34.701
and undercooked at the exact same time.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.588
But I don't want to hurt her feelings,

01:38.623 --> 01:39.706
so, everything she puts in front of me,

01:39.758 --> 01:41.708
I've been tossing, hiding, or flushing.

01:42.794 --> 01:44.594
Knock, knock. Hey, babe.

01:44.629 --> 01:46.629
Oh, hey, honey. Um...

01:46.681 --> 01:48.548
Now that we've got all the food out,

01:48.600 --> 01:49.716
we can finally clean the fridge.

01:51.636 --> 01:52.635
Clean it, Ben.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.606
Um, you forgot your gym bag,

01:56.641 --> 01:58.641
and I found a meat waffle in it.

01:58.693 --> 02:01.561
Oh, yeah, they're just so good

02:01.563 --> 02:03.646
that I wanted to save
one for after practice.

02:03.698 --> 02:05.531
They taste even better when they've

02:05.567 --> 02:07.567
been in a hot locker for a while.

02:07.619 --> 02:08.701
No way!

02:08.737 --> 02:10.652
I just got a resume from Sam Saffe.

02:10.705 --> 02:11.704
I think it's really her.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.574
Wait, wait, wait, Samantha
Saffe from high school?

02:14.626 --> 02:16.576
Ugh, she was so perfect.

02:16.628 --> 02:17.660
God, I hated her.

02:19.581 --> 02:20.630
Really? I thought she was nice.

02:22.667 --> 02:23.716
You know, now that I think about it,

02:23.752 --> 02:25.501
not a huge fan.

02:26.588 --> 02:28.588
Yeah, well, I loved her.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.640
Sat behind her in home
room for three years.

02:30.675 --> 02:33.593
Smell of cherry lip balm and
acne cream still gets me going.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.596
She didn't even know you were alive.

02:36.648 --> 02:38.648
Oh, she will now.

02:38.683 --> 02:40.767
Wait, you're not really
gonna have her come in

02:40.769 --> 02:41.768
for an interview, are you?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.653
Uh, hell yeah.

02:43.688 --> 02:44.687
This is the kind of moment

02:44.739 --> 02:46.572
you dream about your entire life.

02:46.608 --> 02:47.774
I'm gonna let her
think she's got the job,

02:47.776 --> 02:49.659
and then I'm gonna yank it away.

02:49.694 --> 02:52.612
Then she'll feel like I did
every single day of my life.

02:52.664 --> 02:56.699
And that, my friends, will
be the ultimate "re-Benge."

02:57.786 --> 02:58.718
Ha-ha!

02:58.753 --> 03:00.520
How have I not used that before?

03:00.555 --> 03:02.555
"Re-Benge"...
That's genius.

03:04.476 --> 03:08.461
Oh, these are the moments where I
really feel like I dodged a bullet.

03:11.349 --> 03:12.332
- Hey.
- Hey, Riles.

03:13.501 --> 03:15.351
Back from my honeymoon.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.703
Wanna see my tan lines?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.338
Trick question. I don't have any.

03:19.691 --> 03:22.659
Yeah, yeah, I got that
from your postcard.

03:22.711 --> 03:25.778
Even though the post office
blacked out all the nude parts.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.598
Sounds like your honeymoon
was a dream come true.

03:28.633 --> 03:29.732
Yeah. Sort of.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.668
I want a divorce.

03:31.703 --> 03:33.469
What?

03:33.505 --> 03:34.687
You just got married!

03:34.689 --> 03:36.589
You and Brad seem so happy together.

03:36.624 --> 03:39.392
Well, of course Brad was happy.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.376
He was with me!

03:41.429 --> 03:43.429
But, you know, then on
the plane on the way home,

03:43.465 --> 03:45.465
I realized something terrible:

03:45.500 --> 03:48.768
He was coming home with me.

03:48.803 --> 03:51.788
I had breakfast, he was there.

03:51.823 --> 03:53.806
I had lunch, still there.

03:53.808 --> 03:55.792
Dinner, bed, my 2:00 A.M. tinkle time,

03:55.844 --> 03:57.593
there, there, there!

03:57.629 --> 04:00.580
And he's just completely smothering me.

04:00.582 --> 04:04.567
Or... loving you?

04:04.602 --> 04:05.551
(Phone buzzes)

04:05.587 --> 04:06.552
Ugh.

04:06.554 --> 04:09.589
He's left me 10 messages
already this morning,

04:09.624 --> 04:12.408
and I just saw him last night.

04:12.444 --> 04:13.526
(Intercom beeps)

04:13.561 --> 04:16.312
Mrs. Perrin, there's a
Brad Walker here to see you.

04:16.346 --> 04:18.380
Oh my God, Brad? Brad!
What is Brad doing here?

04:18.416 --> 04:19.682
Who knows?

04:19.718 --> 04:22.702
He probably planted a GPS in my bra.

04:22.737 --> 04:24.754
Okay, all right, here's what you do.

04:24.789 --> 04:26.639
Just feel him out and see

04:26.674 --> 04:28.658
if he'll be completely
crushed if I leave him.

04:28.710 --> 04:30.760
Oh, who am I kidding,
of course he will be.

04:30.795 --> 04:32.712
Why would I do that?

04:32.747 --> 04:35.565
I gave you two sons. You owe me.

04:38.586 --> 04:41.437
Yo, Sam's gonna be here any minute.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.456
This is gonna be epic. I'm
not even gonna recognize her.

04:43.458 --> 04:47.493
She's gonna be all like, "oh, my
God, Ben Wheeler, is that you?"

04:47.495 --> 04:50.346
And then I'll be all like, "I'm
sorry, do we know each other?"

04:50.398 --> 04:52.832
And then she'll be like, "it's
me, Sam Saffe from homeroom."

04:52.867 --> 04:54.383
And I'll be like, "oh, what's up, baby?"

04:54.436 --> 04:55.768
Oh, here she is.

04:55.804 --> 04:57.720
Crap. She's even hotter.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.739
Okay. Tucker, follow my lead.

04:59.774 --> 05:05.495
And another thing. If I ever catch
you stealing... olives ever again,

05:05.530 --> 05:06.579
you're fired.

05:06.614 --> 05:07.647
'Cause I'm the owner of this bar.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.500
Yeah, that's right, I own this bar.

05:12.487 --> 05:13.553
Look, I'm sorry, man.

05:21.479 --> 05:23.329
It's not gonna happen again.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.366
Hi, I'm Sam.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.718
I'm here about the manager position.

05:28.753 --> 05:30.603
I'm guessing you're the owner.

05:30.605 --> 05:32.572
Right, hi, Sam.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.607
Why don't we... why don't
we sit down over here?

05:37.662 --> 05:40.480
I'm... I'm Ben.

05:40.515 --> 05:42.515
Nice to meet you.

05:42.567 --> 05:45.635
Uh, so, I think my resume is
up to date with my work history.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.487
Ben Wheeler.

05:47.522 --> 05:49.422
Right. Got it.

05:49.457 --> 05:52.525
Uh, and as you can see, I have a degree in hotel
restaurant management.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.393
I'm sorry, let me stop you right there.

05:54.429 --> 05:56.779
Is it just me, or do
I look familiar to you?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.398
No, I don't think so.

05:59.434 --> 06:01.734
Uh, I have been working
in this industry for...

06:01.769 --> 06:03.719
It's me! Ben!

06:03.755 --> 06:06.689
Ben Wheeler. We went
to high school together?

06:06.724 --> 06:08.574
We did?

06:08.610 --> 06:10.693
I sat behind you in
homeroom for three years.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.396
You did?

06:13.431 --> 06:15.498
I only remember some
annoying guy with braces.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.454
Oh, my God, it is you!

06:21.506 --> 06:24.357
Danny Wheeler's little brother!

06:25.476 --> 06:28.327
How is he?

06:29.697 --> 06:31.731
Well, after the utter
bliss of my honeymoon...

06:31.766 --> 06:33.666
Yeah, Brad, about that.

06:33.701 --> 06:36.736
What if I had some news
that wasn't so blissful?

06:36.771 --> 06:40.473
Oh, great. Just pile it on, life.

06:40.475 --> 06:42.575
Take another swing at
the ol' Brad punching bag.

06:42.577 --> 06:45.478
How much can one man lose in one day?

06:45.513 --> 06:47.513
Oh...

06:47.549 --> 06:49.382
- So, you know?
- Of course I know!

06:49.434 --> 06:50.550
I know that he was so
young and full of life,

06:50.602 --> 06:52.318
with the whole
world right at his...

06:52.370 --> 06:53.519
Wait, how did you find
out that my brother died?

06:53.555 --> 06:56.389
Tad's dead? Oh, my God!

06:56.441 --> 06:58.691
I... I obviously
had no idea.

06:58.726 --> 07:01.611
But... you seemed so upset,

07:01.663 --> 07:03.296
I just assumed.

07:03.331 --> 07:04.680
You assumed that my brother was dead?

07:06.668 --> 07:08.467
I'm a really good assumer.

07:09.704 --> 07:11.537
I got the call this morning.

07:11.539 --> 07:13.522
Bonnie already slipped out of bed.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.524
She's so sweet not to wake me.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.312
I'm the executor of the will,
that's why I came to see you.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.348
That's just... ugh,
that's horrible.

07:22.383 --> 07:23.349
I can't believe it.

07:23.384 --> 07:25.401
Tad's dead.

07:25.453 --> 07:26.402
What are you doing?

07:26.454 --> 07:28.754
I'm a big note taker.

07:30.358 --> 07:32.692
He was on a spiritual
quest around the world

07:32.727 --> 07:33.759
to find himself.

07:33.795 --> 07:36.629
Sadly, he did...

07:36.664 --> 07:38.731
At the bottom of a
ravine in Machu Picchu!

07:38.783 --> 07:43.603
I begged him not to text and
hang glide at the same time!

07:44.622 --> 07:46.505
Oh, hey, Brad.

07:46.557 --> 07:47.640
There you are.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.609
I just got your messages about Tad.

07:49.644 --> 07:51.544
I am so sorry.

07:51.546 --> 07:52.545
- Oh, Bon-Bon.
- Okay.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.397
You're all I have left.

07:54.449 --> 07:56.465
I am never gonna let you go.

07:56.501 --> 07:58.434
Aww...

07:58.486 --> 07:59.785
Never say never.

Hey, babe, what's with the grocery bags?

08:13.601 --> 08:15.534
Oh, just making dinner for my man.

08:17.522 --> 08:19.438
Um, sorry, I can't do dinner.

08:19.490 --> 08:20.506
Why not?

08:22.443 --> 08:23.409
Just give me a minute.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.379
Got it.

08:26.414 --> 08:27.446
Coach put me on a diet

08:27.482 --> 08:28.531
'cause I ate so much of your food.

08:28.566 --> 08:30.416
'Cause I love it so much.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.785
And now my eight-pack is a
six pack like regular people.

08:33.788 --> 08:34.754
(Elevator dings)

08:38.710 --> 08:40.710
I love this building.

08:40.745 --> 08:42.695
Someone left a perfectly
good pizza in there.

08:49.537 --> 08:51.587
Well, that truly could
not have gone any better.

08:51.622 --> 08:54.423
Dude, I'm sorry I left early.

08:54.459 --> 08:55.491
I just got tired.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.463
No, I meant Sam.

09:00.515 --> 09:04.250
Let's just say she's never gonna
forget Ben Wheeler ever again.

09:04.302 --> 09:07.269
You get your big moment of
revenge and send her packing?

09:07.305 --> 09:08.738
Better. I hired her.

09:10.725 --> 09:13.676
I don't think you
know how revenge works.

09:13.728 --> 09:16.645
No, man, I was thinking too small.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.714
You see, we'll work together,

09:18.766 --> 09:20.700
Sam will fall hopelessly
in love with me,

09:20.735 --> 09:23.436
and then, when she least
expects it, I'll fire her.

09:23.471 --> 09:25.454
Bam!

09:25.490 --> 09:26.572
"Ben-geance" is mine.

09:26.624 --> 09:31.360
Hahaha! Damn, that one's good too.

09:31.412 --> 09:32.561
You know what you are?

09:32.597 --> 09:35.398
A "Ben-ace" to society.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.800
All right, here you go.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.434
Sorry, it's kind of a tight squeeze.

09:43.486 --> 09:45.786
All right, let me just clear
some of this stuff off for you.

09:45.838 --> 09:48.906
Oh, this is a photo
of my daughter, Emma,

09:48.941 --> 09:51.642
who I'm raising by myself...

09:51.694 --> 09:52.693
Selflessly.

09:53.796 --> 09:56.597
Oh, let me just get
this out of your way.

09:56.649 --> 09:58.749
Just a picture of me at
the beach last summer.

09:58.784 --> 10:00.634
Pretty much a gun show.

10:02.655 --> 10:04.555
Oh, I'll get that.

10:09.645 --> 10:11.829
Hey, um, I was wondering
if you and I could...

10:11.864 --> 10:13.914
Could go out? Whoa, slow it down, sugar!

10:13.983 --> 10:15.883
Not sure how appropriate that would be.

10:15.918 --> 10:17.918
I just wanted to go over the schedule.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.687
Oh.

10:19.739 --> 10:20.905
Oh, we can go over the schedule.

10:20.957 --> 10:22.790
We can go over it all night long.

10:23.860 --> 10:26.677
Hey, Ben. Did you know
Tucker's stealing olives?

10:26.712 --> 10:27.728
Danny!

10:27.763 --> 10:30.664
Oh, Sam, hi. Ben said he hired you.

10:30.666 --> 10:32.633
Oh, it's so good to see you.

10:32.685 --> 10:35.536
You know, he's practically living
with his girlfriend, Riley Perrin.

10:35.588 --> 10:37.555
Riley Perrin? Really?

10:37.607 --> 10:39.640
She got hot.

10:39.675 --> 10:41.942
I actually dated her first.

10:41.978 --> 10:44.795
I think the last time I saw you,

10:44.830 --> 10:45.880
you were signing my yearbook.

10:45.882 --> 10:48.782
Oh, well, I hope I wrote
something inspirational.

10:48.784 --> 10:51.735
Like, "stay sweet," or
"have a great summer."

10:51.771 --> 10:53.721
I actually have no idea.

10:53.756 --> 10:55.673
That idiot Bobby
Sherwood stole my yearbook

10:55.708 --> 10:56.807
before I could see what anyone wrote.

10:56.859 --> 10:59.627
And I was homecoming
queen, so there was a lot.

11:00.746 --> 11:03.664
Oh well. I'm gonna go
check on the timecards.

11:03.666 --> 11:05.499
Really good to see you, Danny.

11:05.551 --> 11:07.551
Yeah, you too. Have a nice day.

11:07.587 --> 11:09.570
Ooh, maybe I wrote that?

11:12.608 --> 11:14.875
Her yearbook. That's it!

11:14.911 --> 11:17.428
I'm gonna get her yearbook back and
then she's gonna fall in love with me!

11:17.463 --> 11:18.712
How are you gonna do that?

11:18.748 --> 11:20.848
Senior year I professed my
feelings to her in her yearbook,

11:20.883 --> 11:23.734
but I chickened out, so I
stole it so she wouldn't see it.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.753
Then I framed Bobby Sherwood.

11:25.788 --> 11:27.721
It was the perfect crime.

11:27.773 --> 11:29.740
Hey, uh,

11:29.792 --> 11:31.759
why is your face taped to my body?

11:35.665 --> 11:37.765
So, I've drawn up some
simple divorce papers.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.701
Just get Brad to sign these, and
bing, bang, boom, you're single again.

11:40.753 --> 11:42.536
Okay. First of all,

11:42.571 --> 11:45.572
"bing, bang, boom" is how we
got together in the first place.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.525
And second, his brother just died.

11:48.561 --> 11:50.928
I can't throw divorce
papers in his face.

11:50.963 --> 11:52.813
I have to let him down gently.

11:52.815 --> 11:53.897
- (Knocking)
- Oh my God, that's him.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.866
Okay, just take those papers and hide.

11:55.901 --> 11:57.918
I do not want him to see what
a heartless person you are.

11:57.970 --> 11:59.853
Okay, just go! Go, go, go, go, go!

11:59.889 --> 12:01.789
- Mrs. Wheeler...
- Go!

12:05.828 --> 12:07.678
Hi, Emma.

12:07.713 --> 12:10.748
When you hit your rebellious teens
and you think about running away,

12:10.800 --> 12:12.616
please, take me with you.

12:12.652 --> 12:13.567
No.

12:15.588 --> 12:18.906
Bonnie, my brother's death
has changed everything for me.

12:18.908 --> 12:20.841
Life is fragile.

12:20.893 --> 12:23.894
And I realized that I
want to leave a legacy.

12:23.929 --> 12:25.512
Okay, neat. Um, listen, honey,

12:25.564 --> 12:27.448
um, we need to talk...

12:27.450 --> 12:29.750
I wanna make a baby.

12:30.820 --> 12:31.819
That's nice, sweetie.

12:31.821 --> 12:32.803
With who?

12:32.838 --> 12:33.804
With you?

12:36.709 --> 12:37.791
Just think about it.

12:37.793 --> 12:41.662
You and me raising a little Brad junior.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.597
Or maybe we should name him Tad.

12:43.649 --> 12:46.500
Eh, screw it, I like Brad better.

12:46.552 --> 12:48.635
Okay, could you just excuse
me for one little second.

12:49.939 --> 12:52.506
Oh God, oh God.

12:52.558 --> 12:54.892
Brad wants me to have a baby.

12:55.911 --> 12:58.846
Does he know how old you are?

12:58.898 --> 13:00.831
I mean, he can pump
the well all he wants,

13:00.866 --> 13:02.883
but he's only gonna get sand.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.754
Emma, close your eyes.

13:08.657 --> 13:09.623
Riley: Oww, oww!

13:11.644 --> 13:13.544
Hey, I got her yearbook.

13:13.579 --> 13:16.513
I tore up my love note
like she tore up my heart.

13:16.549 --> 13:17.548
I'm gonna finally get Sam.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.565
You mean get back at Sam?

13:18.617 --> 13:19.833
- That's what I said.
- That's not what I heard.

13:19.835 --> 13:21.602
- What'd you hear?
- That you're still in love with her.

13:21.637 --> 13:22.853
Pfft. Come on, that's ridiculous.

13:24.557 --> 13:26.473
Oh, my God, she's so hot.

13:28.911 --> 13:30.461
Hey, Sam.

13:30.496 --> 13:32.796
I got your yearbook
back from Bobby Sherwood.

13:32.832 --> 13:36.750
It was a pretty big struggle,
so there might be a page missing.

13:36.802 --> 13:39.770
Ben, you're amazing, thank you.

13:39.805 --> 13:41.789
I'll never forget this.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.027
That's right.

13:47.029 --> 13:50.731
Ben Wheeler, most likely to steal
your heart, not your yearbook.

13:50.783 --> 13:53.584
Not your yearbook!

13:53.636 --> 13:56.537
How's your plan going to fire
and publicly humiliate her?

13:56.572 --> 13:57.588
Fantastic.

13:57.623 --> 13:59.590
I'm just gonna let her
suffer a little bit longer.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.458
It's the perfect "Ben-detta."

14:01.494 --> 14:04.445
Ha-ha! They just keep
getting better and better.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.779
No, they don't.

14:08.901 --> 14:10.701
Can you take this to table five?

14:15.133 --> 14:16.149
Mrs. Wheeler!

14:16.184 --> 14:17.984
What are you doing?

14:18.019 --> 14:20.003
Well, you know, I thought about it,

14:20.038 --> 14:21.137
and I was being rash.

14:21.172 --> 14:23.990
You know? And I needed to
give Brad one more chance

14:24.025 --> 14:25.909
to just stop smothering me.

14:25.961 --> 14:30.029
But this morning, he did something
that proves he's never gonna change.

14:30.081 --> 14:33.933
We had sex, and he
wanted to cuddle after.

14:36.888 --> 14:38.271
I... like, "get off me, man!"

14:40.292 --> 14:42.225
You know what... you
know that I think?

14:42.277 --> 14:44.143
I think that you're scared.

14:44.179 --> 14:46.179
Okay? I think you're
afraid of how you feel,

14:46.214 --> 14:48.147
and you're just looking
for an easy way out.

14:48.183 --> 14:49.215
Well, you know what, Mrs. Wheeler?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.167
That's not what love is.

14:51.202 --> 14:53.102
All right? Love is a commitment

14:53.138 --> 14:55.071
where you ride the good times,

14:55.123 --> 14:56.973
and you talk about the bad times,

14:56.975 --> 14:59.075
and you always tell
each other the truth.

14:59.077 --> 15:01.928
It's like me and Danny.

15:01.963 --> 15:04.914
We tell each other everything.

15:04.916 --> 15:06.799
Even when the truth hurts.

15:06.851 --> 15:07.867
I hate your cooking.

15:09.838 --> 15:11.304
Good example. See?

15:11.339 --> 15:14.824
I mean, if Danny really hated my
cooking, he would say it just like that.

15:14.876 --> 15:16.225
No, I really hate your cooking.

15:18.163 --> 15:20.029
Thanks, babe, but I made my point.

15:20.081 --> 15:24.033
Mrs. Wheeler, Brad
deserves to hear the truth.

15:24.069 --> 15:28.955
All right? Just tell him that he's
smothering you and you need some space.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.373
Wow.

15:30.425 --> 15:33.876
Who knew a noodle with lipstick
could give me a good kick in the ass?

15:35.897 --> 15:39.232
I was just pushing him away
before he could push me away.

15:39.267 --> 15:41.530
And while I would like
to be able to get the

15:41.630 --> 15:45.171
mail without getting
an "I miss you" text,

15:45.206 --> 15:48.191
the good outweighs the Brad.

15:48.243 --> 15:50.276
I love him.

15:50.311 --> 15:53.162
And I'm gonna make it work,

15:53.214 --> 15:55.231
no matter how hard he has to try.

15:58.086 --> 15:59.969
Excuse me, I'm looking for Sam Saffe,

16:00.021 --> 16:01.020
does she work here?

16:04.042 --> 16:06.025
- Ben Wheeler!
- B-b-b-b-b-Bobby Sherwood.

16:06.061 --> 16:09.262
W-w-w-w-w-w-what
are you doing here?

16:09.314 --> 16:11.831
This is so random.
This is random, right?

16:11.866 --> 16:13.916
Yeah, I got this bizarre
voice-mail from Sam

16:13.968 --> 16:15.868
telling me off for stealing
her yearbook or something.

16:15.904 --> 16:18.171
Wow, that is so weird.

16:18.206 --> 16:20.189
You know what? She's
probably over it by now.

16:20.191 --> 16:22.158
You should let bygones be bygones.

16:22.193 --> 16:24.093
So, bye, be gone.

16:24.129 --> 16:26.195
Nah, that'd be really immature.

16:26.231 --> 16:27.196
I think I should clear this up.

16:29.050 --> 16:30.850
Bobby,

16:30.902 --> 16:32.322
remember that time
you stuffed me in my

16:32.348 --> 16:33.920
locker after giving me
an aggressive wedgie?

16:33.955 --> 16:36.939
Then you felt bad and said
someday you'd make it up to me?

16:36.975 --> 16:38.041
Well, Bobby,

16:38.076 --> 16:39.926
today's that day.

16:41.846 --> 16:43.029
All right, let the record reflect

16:43.081 --> 16:46.899
that the Wheeler-Walker
divorce has duly been shredded.

16:46.935 --> 16:48.901
Knock, knock, knock. Ah, Bonnie.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.253
I'm glad you're here.

16:50.255 --> 16:51.838
Okay, Brad, we need to talk.

16:51.873 --> 16:53.239
It's all right, I know why you
haven't been yourself lately.

16:53.274 --> 16:55.258
- You do?
- You can sense that I'm unhappy.

16:55.293 --> 16:56.859
- I can?
- Yes.

16:56.895 --> 16:57.860
And that's why I'm leaving you.

16:57.896 --> 16:59.162
What?

16:59.214 --> 17:01.030
You're leaving me?

17:01.066 --> 17:03.066
I am the best thing that
ever happened to you.

17:03.101 --> 17:04.067
You're absolutely right.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.118
You'll never meet another woman like me.

17:06.154 --> 17:07.936
I totally agree.

17:07.989 --> 17:11.124
And without me, you would just
be some young, hot, single guy!

17:11.175 --> 17:13.025
Okay, that one totally got away from me.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.027
Bonnie...

17:15.063 --> 17:17.046
I need to finish Tad's journey.

17:17.082 --> 17:18.948
I'm going on his quest.

17:23.855 --> 17:25.253
Okay, wait, so...

17:25.290 --> 17:27.223
So you're not leaving me?

17:27.275 --> 17:30.259
You're just gonna be halfway
across the world from me?

17:32.180 --> 17:33.196
I can deal with that.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.182
Oh, thank you, Bon-Bon.

17:36.217 --> 17:38.234
I was so afraid that
you wouldn't understand.

17:38.236 --> 17:40.036
So, you'll be right
here when I get back?

17:40.088 --> 17:41.170
You bet I might!

17:44.159 --> 17:46.959
Okay, just remember everything
I told you to say, you got it?

17:46.995 --> 17:48.227
Sam, hey, look who it is.

17:48.313 --> 17:51.097
It's that horrible Bobby
Sherwood who stole your yearbook.

17:51.132 --> 17:52.915
Bobby Sherwood.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.934
Came here to tell you he's sorry.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.869
Any time, Bobby.

17:56.905 --> 17:59.005
Sorry. I'm a terrible person.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.841
Thank God Ben Wheeler showed
me the error of my ways.

18:03.244 --> 18:04.861
Just tell me one thing,

18:04.896 --> 18:06.262
why did you do it?

18:06.264 --> 18:07.814
I don't know...

18:07.866 --> 18:11.217
I guess, maybe... I liked you.

18:11.269 --> 18:12.785
You liked me?

18:12.821 --> 18:15.171
I mean, everyone did, but
no one else stole my stuff.

18:15.223 --> 18:17.190
Well, you never noticed me,

18:17.225 --> 18:18.958
and that made me mad.

18:18.993 --> 18:20.209
So, I took it.

18:20.245 --> 18:23.112
It was stupid and immature.

18:23.148 --> 18:24.914
And I'm sorry.

18:24.966 --> 18:26.082
Really?

18:26.134 --> 18:29.035
I honestly had no idea.

18:29.070 --> 18:30.987
Actually kinda sweet.

18:33.892 --> 18:35.825
Do you wanna get a drink sometime?

18:35.827 --> 18:37.960
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:37.996 --> 18:39.896
I'm the one you should
wanna have a drink with.

18:39.931 --> 18:42.198
I'm the one who stole your yearbook!

18:42.200 --> 18:43.199
I said too much.

18:44.936 --> 18:48.120
Wait, you stole my yearbook? Why?

18:48.156 --> 18:50.122
Yes, because I liked you,

18:50.175 --> 18:52.108
and when I heard you
talk about the yearbook,

18:52.143 --> 18:55.127
I realized how stupid I was and I just
wanted to do something nice for you.

18:55.163 --> 18:57.063
I'm sorry.

18:57.098 --> 18:59.081
You know, if you had
such strong feelings,

18:59.117 --> 19:02.018
you should have just expressed them
instead of keeping them bottled up.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.986
A yearbook would have been
a perfect place to do that.

19:05.924 --> 19:07.089
I'm a therapist now.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.090
Here's my card.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.896
So, what's the deal, Wheeler?

19:13.932 --> 19:15.898
Are you cool moving on
from this high school stuff?

19:15.934 --> 19:18.251
'Cause if you can't, it's gonna make
it way too awkward for me to work here,

19:18.286 --> 19:20.887
and I really like this job.

19:20.939 --> 19:22.271
You don't still like me, do you?

19:22.307 --> 19:23.873
Oh, my God, no.

19:23.908 --> 19:25.791
No. Haha.

19:25.827 --> 19:26.809
No, not at all.

19:26.844 --> 19:28.261
I'm so over you.

19:28.313 --> 19:30.162
Let's not make this weird.

19:30.198 --> 19:33.099
Can't a guy just get a girl
her yearbook back? Please!

19:35.186 --> 19:36.819
Okay. Good.

19:36.854 --> 19:38.287
- I'm gonna go back to work now.
- All right.

19:42.243 --> 19:44.160
So, you gonna fire her now?

19:44.212 --> 19:48.080
You kidding? I don't want to
break her heart. She's so into me.

19:48.132 --> 19:50.216
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

19:50.251 --> 19:52.251
Nope.

19:52.303 --> 19:54.253
Everything is "Ben-tastic."

19:58.226 --> 19:59.842
Okay, that's the first
one that didn't work.

20:03.147 --> 20:06.091
Hey, Riley, I need to
come clean about something.

20:06.191 --> 20:08.188
I don't like your cooking.

20:08.617 --> 20:11.622
Really... you were serious?

20:11.722 --> 20:15.530
Yeah, I'm sorry I lied, I just
didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

20:16.934 --> 20:18.534
That's okay, sweetie.

20:18.536 --> 20:21.170
We'll just... eat out more.

20:21.172 --> 20:22.872
You know what? Why don't
you go grab your jacket,

20:22.874 --> 20:24.507
and we'll go out to dinner right now?

20:24.509 --> 20:26.342
- Really? Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.014
- Excellent advice, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Mm-hmm.

20:32.016 --> 20:34.851
Looks like I never have to cook again.

20:34.853 --> 20:38.154
I can't believe he fell
for the meat waffle.

20:38.156 --> 20:40.757
Yeah, like father, like son.

20:40.759 --> 20:44.193
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

20:44.195 --> 20:45.328
Hey, what are you doing?

20:45.330 --> 20:47.130
Just, like, a fruit fly.

20:48.305 --> 20:54.542
