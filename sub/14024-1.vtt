MAN:
Yeah. But the champagne glass...

01:02:21.544 --> 01:02:23.205
...a bit much, don't you think?

01:02:23.379 --> 01:02:25.244
We don't need theatrics.

01:02:25.414 --> 01:02:27.382
Just keeping it interesting.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.744
Have you read your e-mail?

01:02:28.918 --> 01:02:30.852
They want you back in Gotham again.

01:02:32.087 --> 01:02:33.748
Yeah, I saw.

01:02:33.923 --> 01:02:35.413
MAN:
The place is changing.

01:02:35.591 --> 01:02:39.254
The police are developing a backbone,
which is why we need this hit.

01:02:39.428 --> 01:02:42.761
Our Russian associates
have been having difficulties there.

01:02:42.932 --> 01:02:46.265
His removal would alleviate
most of their problems.

01:02:46.435 --> 01:02:49.370
However, this one could get dicey.

01:02:49.538 --> 01:02:51.199
[FLY BUZZING]

01:02:53.642 --> 01:02:55.667
Just another cop kill.

01:02:55.845 --> 01:02:58.643
You think? You worry me sometimes.

01:03:00.683 --> 01:03:02.913
You worry too much.

01:03:09.892 --> 01:03:11.257
MAN:
Word came from the Russians.

01:03:11.427 --> 01:03:13.224
The hit's in the next couple of days.

01:03:13.696 --> 01:03:16.187
They say he can target
from 2000 meters or more.

01:03:16.365 --> 01:03:18.424
We've put a 24-hour watch on Gordon...

01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:20.762
...but we can't cover every window
and rooftop.

01:03:21.303 --> 01:03:22.600
I'll do what I can.

01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:25.831
Thanks. We've never dealt with anyone
like Deadshot before.

01:03:26.008 --> 01:03:27.032
Maybe you have.

01:03:27.743 --> 01:03:30.041
Ronald Marshall's PDA.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:36.942
There's a POP mail account.
It links to an encrypted wire transmission...

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:40.555
...exactly one week
before Teresa Williams' assassination.

01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:44.188
-Where'd you get this?
-Just turn it on.

01:03:56.405 --> 01:03:57.429
[GRUNTS]

01:03:57.606 --> 01:03:59.267
All right, let's go.

01:03:59.441 --> 01:04:00.772
[SIRENS WAILING]

01:04:09.952 --> 01:04:11.783
Alfred, how's the satellite picture?

01:04:11.954 --> 01:04:15.720
ALFRED [O VER RADIO] : <i>Splendid.</i>
<i>I can almost see your pointy ears, sir.</i>

01:04:15.891 --> 01:04:19.884
<i>But there's no sign of any rooftop sniper,</i>
<i>at least not in your area.</i>

01:04:20.062 --> 01:04:22.189
Stay with me, AIfred.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.960
I'm on it, sir.

01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:38.011
Sir, I'd feel better
if you put your helmet back on.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.307
This car isn't completely buIIetproof.

01:04:40.482 --> 01:04:44.509
I'm having a hard enough time reading this
screen without the glare from that visor.

01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:48.953
What I'd like to know is how many other
e-mail clients Deadshot has cultivated.

01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:52.460
I want this killer and I want him tonight.

01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:55.758
That doesn't mean you shouId make
yourself a sitting duck.

01:04:55.931 --> 01:04:59.492
-He likes moving targets, you know.
-Keep driving.

01:05:18.153 --> 01:05:20.986
ALFRED [O VER RADIO] : <i>Master Bruce,</i>
<i>there's a troublesome spot up ahead.</i>

01:05:21.657 --> 01:05:26.219
Lieutenant Gordon will be passing
under the el bridge just as the train goes by.

01:05:26.395 --> 01:05:30.229
Fortunately, the satellite picks up
no one on the bridge.

01:05:30.399 --> 01:05:34.233
Hard to believe he'd try to fire
from a 60-mile-an-hour train.

01:05:34.403 --> 01:05:36.394
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:18.038
Good Lord. There's another train
coming in the opposite direction.

01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:26.554
AII right. It's showtime.

01:06:57.386 --> 01:06:58.614
So predictabIe.

01:06:58.787 --> 01:07:01.585
I knew I'd flush you out
if I went after the lieutenant.

01:07:01.757 --> 01:07:05.386
Let's make my clients very happy.

01:07:12.968 --> 01:07:14.196
Sir, are you all right?

01:07:14.369 --> 01:07:16.234
Is your body armor holding up?

01:07:16.738 --> 01:07:19.832
It's fine. At least from this far away.

01:07:20.008 --> 01:07:22.408
Sir, there's a tunnel, straight ahead.

01:07:29.017 --> 01:07:31.008
[GRUNTING]

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.198
Too bad. Now what will you do?

01:07:53.642 --> 01:07:55.303
[GRO ANS]

01:07:56.745 --> 01:08:01.614
Either he's the bravest man I ever faced
or a complete fool.

01:08:06.889 --> 01:08:10.882
I must say, Batman, that's the first time
anyone's tried to stop my gunfire...

01:08:11.059 --> 01:08:13.289
...by running into it.

01:08:13.896 --> 01:08:18.162
No suit is bulletproof at close range.

01:08:20.102 --> 01:08:22.662
We'll make this quick now.

01:08:24.106 --> 01:08:28.337
WeII, weII, don't teII me
I finally got the bat--?

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:29.841
Huh?

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.551
[GRUNTS]

01:08:44.693 --> 01:08:46.819
Shoot your mouth off now, Deadshot.

01:08:47.996 --> 01:08:49.657
[SCREAMS]

01:08:55.037 --> 01:08:56.970
Don't kill me.

01:08:57.139 --> 01:09:00.904
It was the Russians, they want you dead.

01:09:02.077 --> 01:09:03.339
I was just...

01:09:03.511 --> 01:09:04.536
[WHIMPERS]

01:09:04.712 --> 01:09:06.908
...doing my job.

01:09:10.719 --> 01:09:12.380
[GRUNTS]

01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:35.841
<i>Unnamed police officials report</i>
<i>that the mysterious Batman...</i>

01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:38.979
<i>...may have had a hand in last night's</i>
<i>capture of Floyd Lawton...</i>

<i>alleged assassinations.</i>

<i>If convicted, both men</i>

01:09:55.197 --> 01:09:57.631
Thanks again, AIfred.
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:09:57.799 --> 01:09:59.289
You're welcome, sir.

01:09:59.468 --> 01:10:03.131
Though next time someone shoots at you,
try ducking.

01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:06.472
It was just like that night
in the alley, Alfred...

01:10:06.642 --> 01:10:09.736
...the closeness of the walls, the gunfire.

01:10:10.746 --> 01:10:14.648
It seems I've been trying to stop
those two bullets all my life.

01:10:16.184 --> 01:10:18.516
It's a fool's dream, AIfred.

01:10:18.687 --> 01:10:21.656
Sometimes I think I should
just be done with it.

01:10:26.028 --> 01:10:27.325
Perhaps you're right, sir.

01:10:27.496 --> 01:10:30.431
But something tells me
you have a deeper purpose.

01:10:36.805 --> 01:10:37.931
Sir?
