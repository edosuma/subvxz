SYLVIA: No! What is he doing here?

00:41.667 --> 00:45.546
LORD HATER: Leave it! She'll be here,
okay! I totally did not get stood up!

00:45.629 --> 00:48.757
LORD HATER: Bring me a new candle!
This one's stupid!

00:48.841 --> 00:50.801
Poor Lord Hater!

00:50.884 --> 00:54.096
Are you kidding? This is
hilarious! We got a fancy dinner

00:54.179 --> 00:58.267
and a show! (GASPS) It serves him right
for being a jerk all the time.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.482
Aww, maybe if someone gave him a chance,
he wouldn't be so darn evil!

01:05.566 --> 01:08.443
And maybe we should mind our own beeswax!
So he got jilted

01:08.527 --> 01:12.114
-it's not the end of the world
-Hey, Peepers. Yeah, the king

01:12.239 --> 01:15.951
of this stupid planet was totally lying!
His lame daughter was a no-show.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.329
Whatever. I'm gonna head back to the ship

01:19.413 --> 01:21.623

-Okay, so it is the end of this world.
-Yes, this is a disaster!

01:34.803 --> 01:38.682
We gotta find him a replacement date
or his self-esteem will drop dramatically

01:38.765 --> 01:42.269
So the planet will be doomed!

01:45.564 --> 01:48.483

I don't have to tip if I
just had the bread, right?

01:54.281 --> 01:57.159
Oh, no,
I cannot believe that I,

01:57.242 --> 02:03.415

Come on, Syl,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.975
the fate of the planet depends
on your sparkling dinner conversation.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.770
All you have to do is make him
feel good and confident.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.197
He's coming over, it's working.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.952
It's really not.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.416
Heaven must be missing an angel

02:47.000 --> 02:53.215
-because here I am.
-Oh, brother... are you charming!

02:53.465 --> 02:57.427
You have me at a disadvantage,
obviously everyone knows me.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.807
Lord Hater, hate's great, best villain.
And you are?

03:02.015 --> 03:07.104
Uhm... I don't know. Linguini...
Von... Breadstick?

03:07.229 --> 03:12.192
-Lin for short.
-"Von". Fancy. Wait...

03:12.734 --> 03:18.115
-Don't I know you?
-(GULPS) Nope, I don't think so.

don't you think?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.943
Huh? Oh, yeah! Uh huh!

03:55.027 --> 03:59.948
Scusi, signorina, maybe you like-a to
order-a something from de special men-u.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.580
Your lightning bolts are so pointy.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.791
I know, can you believe I just
roll out of bed this way

04:09.875 --> 04:13.128
Let's order. Then you can
tell me more things you like about me.

Yep. Dinner's over. Now we can get on with
the rest of the date!

I object.

09:53.969 --> 10:00.642
I do declare, Lord Hater, I am your number
one fan. I've pined for you from afar

10:00.726 --> 10:06.315
for ages, always too afraid to approach,
Oh! But now that I see you in the arms of

10:06.398 --> 10:13.113
this cheap horse, no offence, I must say
fiddle dee dee to that, and say my piece

10:13.197 --> 10:14.573
Take me, instead.

I got you into this mess,
I'm gonna get you out!

-By putting yourself into the mess?
-It's not a perfect plan.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.666
Oh, hehe. Awkward.

Ladies, there's no need to fight over me.
When you're the most dynamic overlord
