00:39.361 --> 00:41.507
<i>In 689 A.D.</i>

00:44.009 --> 00:47.535
<i>upon Emperor Tang Gaozhong's death</i>

00:50.401 --> 00:55.438
<i>Empress Wu a regent for 7 years</i>

00:58.509 --> 01:01.204
<i>would soon be coronated</i>

01:02.270 --> 01:07.259
<i>as history's first female emperor.</i>

01:11.209 --> 01:14.051
<i>Royal clansmen and founding officials</i>

01:15.723 --> 01:18.299
<i>resented a woman usurping the throne</i>

01:20.310 --> 01:22.494
<i>and colluded</i>

01:23.289 --> 01:25.922
<i>to overthrow her reign.</i>

01:28.969 --> 01:33.747
<i>Behind its peaceful fa?
ade the capital was lurking with danger.</i>

01:37.159 --> 01:40.245
<i>All hell was about to break loose...</i>

02:09.555 --> 02:12.697
The Empress hereby decrees:

02:13.398 --> 02:17.415
The Court of State Ceremonials shall

02:17.716 --> 02:20.193
welcome Umayyad diplomat Aspar

02:20.494 --> 02:22.453
and escort him to the Towering Buddha

02:22.954 --> 02:25.383
to revere the Empress's divine glory.

02:34.013 --> 02:36.501
This is Master Jia.

02:37.095 --> 02:39.747
The Buddha is sixty six yards high

02:39.948 --> 02:42.125
symbolizing the sixty sixth heaven

02:42.326 --> 02:45.028
or the ninth cloud.

02:45.229 --> 02:46.070
Please translate for the General.

02:46.371 --> 02:48.245
I already explained it to the General.

02:53.672 --> 02:56.484
The General asked if it be ready before the Coronation.

02:56.799 --> 02:57.685
Sure

02:57.786 --> 03:02.144
or my life cannot be spared.

03:11.699 --> 03:13.825
This is so spectacular!

03:14.326 --> 03:17.126
Huge resources have been spent on this.

03:17.727 --> 03:20.012
2 million catties of metal were used.

03:20.313 --> 03:22.128
More than 1000 catties are burnt each day.

03:24.082 --> 03:26.388
The temperature is too high here.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.056
Bring water and a towel for the General!

03:46.888 --> 03:48.819
The General asked of whom the portrait is.

03:49.172 --> 03:52.585
This is Lu Li our Imperial Chaplain.

03:52.786 --> 03:55.699
He's very potent and trusted by the Empress!

03:56.255 --> 03:59.666
These are amulets bestowed by the Chaplain.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.839
They can dispel evil and thwart disaster...

04:03.411 --> 04:05.301
Master Jia is here.

04:05.402 --> 04:07.094
Is somebody going to speak with him?

04:07.325 --> 04:08.635
What shall we do?

04:10.126 --> 04:11.774
We better speak up

04:13.056 --> 04:15.098
before lives are lost!

04:18.140 --> 04:19.628
Who should do that?

04:21.296 --> 04:22.425
You go.

04:26.062 --> 04:27.599
Let's go up from here.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.578
Today's so clear we can see miles from here!

04:33.878 --> 04:35.703
Lift him up.

04:44.758 --> 04:46.012
This tubular pillar

04:46.013 --> 04:48.204
is crucial to the Buddha.

04:48.405 --> 04:50.128
It's 82 yards long

04:50.629 --> 04:53.225
and made from one casting.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.771
It is surrounded by 81 steel chains.

04:55.943 --> 04:57.266
In the face of hurricanes or earthquakes,

04:57.541 --> 04:58.664
the chains will pull in the opposite direction,

04:58.865 --> 05:00.000
prevending the Buddha from collapsing.

05:00.101 --> 05:02.364
They're here. Mind your steps,

05:07.817 --> 05:08.887
General,

05:09.388 --> 05:12.801
these are the Buddha's two eyes.And here...

05:13.085 --> 05:14.487
Master Jia... Master Jia...

05:14.488 --> 05:15.701
What's the matter?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.641
Please go ahead...

05:20.312 --> 05:21.301
What is it?

05:21.399 --> 05:23.594
When you inspected the pillar yesterday,

05:23.795 --> 05:25.247
you removed some amulets.

05:25.348 --> 05:27.448
Should we put them back?

05:27.849 --> 05:29.126
They haven't been put back?

05:29.527 --> 05:32.626
Moving the amulets will bring bad luck,

05:32.627 --> 05:33.868
so...

05:34.369 --> 05:35.636
after you have moved them,

05:35.837 --> 05:37.037
everybody is so scared...

05:39.506 --> 05:42.105
Our work has been stuck.

05:42.206 --> 05:45.601
Put them back right away. Hurry up

05:57.723 --> 05:58.902
this way, please.

05:59.798 --> 06:00.882
Please...

06:13.883 --> 06:17.384
He says we can see the coronation stage here.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.146
The General says...

06:35.899 --> 06:37.912
Sir... Sir...

06:45.948 --> 06:50.488
Water! Hurry up!

08:00.155 --> 08:00.788
Master Xue.

08:00.789 --> 08:01.789
Huh?

08:02.764 --> 08:05.631
Sir, the corpse has been burnt to ashes.

08:05.732 --> 08:07.096
No flesh was left.

08:07.497 --> 08:09.720
Any forensic findings from the corpse?

08:15.504 --> 08:18.223
Sir! We found this on the corpse.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.144
Phosphorus!

08:24.099 --> 08:26.456
The corpse is filled with it!

08:27.894 --> 08:29.101
In order to melt the copper,

08:29.499 --> 08:31.801
much phosphorus is left inside the Buddha.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.812
I bet this gave the murderer the opportunity

08:34.297 --> 08:38.313
to use what's already in the scene.

08:41.921 --> 08:45.900
Master Jia was burnt by yellow phosphorus!

08:45.901 --> 08:47.001
No.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.899
The flame exploded from inside the body.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.744
Pei? How could the flame explode from inside?

09:00.766 --> 09:02.414
Sir, have a look.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.422
The bones were burnt to ashes.

09:07.023 --> 09:09.248
Though there are ashes inside the shoe,

09:09.449 --> 09:11.139
its outside remains unscathed.

09:11.199 --> 09:12.368
The flame must have been burnt from inside.

09:12.369 --> 09:14.218
to make such remains.

09:15.159 --> 09:16.255
Perhaps!

09:16.656 --> 09:19.389
But the corpse is dense with phosphorus.

09:19.490 --> 09:22.281
Someone must have poisoned his food!

09:22.482 --> 09:24.081
Phosphorus stinks. He couldn't miss it.

09:24.382 --> 09:25.849
Even if he had taken it by mistake,the symptoms

09:25.950 --> 09:29.426
should be shortness of breath and bodily pain.

09:29.727 --> 09:31.258
He shouldn't be aflame.

09:32.699 --> 09:34.102
Cut the crap.

09:35.351 --> 09:37.945
The murderer is among you.

09:38.346 --> 09:40.316
Nab them all back for interrogation!

09:47.801 --> 09:53.161
Sir...Sir.

09:53.462 --> 09:56.069
You...the supervisor.

09:56.824 --> 09:58.512
come to my front.

09:59.289 --> 10:00.935
Sir...

10:00.988 --> 10:02.933
if you arrest me,our work will be delayed

10:03.001 --> 10:04.464
and we're doomed.

10:04.635 --> 10:05.874
What's in your left hand?

10:12.123 --> 10:13.713
What is this?

10:13.903 --> 10:15.800
I was punished by the Ministry of Justice

10:19.021 --> 10:24.023
and had been jailed for eight years

10:24.424 --> 10:27.512
for involving in Detective Dee's treason.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.190
Treason?

10:34.223 --> 10:37.583
A dork like you in treason?

10:43.199 --> 10:46.656
Sir, if the Buddha can't be finished on time,

10:46.957 --> 10:48.630
the Empress will blame us.

10:48.964 --> 10:51.975
Supreme Court won't be better off either.

10:52.662 --> 10:55.164
You dare to threaten us with the Empress?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.873
Good. I'll give you want you want.

11:01.474 --> 11:03.301
I'll chop your right hand off as well.

11:03.533 --> 11:06.593
He was struck by divine intervention!

11:07.088 --> 11:10.323
Master Jia was struck by divine intervention!

11:10.484 --> 11:11.584
Out of my way!

11:14.080 --> 11:16.899
What's this crap? Divine intervention?

11:18.497 --> 11:20.101
Master Jia...

11:20.121 --> 11:24.552
moved the amulets during
his inspection a few days ago.

11:28.491 --> 11:30.053
Amulets?

11:45.025 --> 11:46.552
<i>Sir...</i>

11:46.953 --> 11:48.425
<i>What superstition!</i>

11:48.926 --> 11:51.628
<i>Divine intervention?</i>

11:57.102 --> 12:00.425
<i>Let divine intervention strike me now!</i>

12:02.197 --> 12:05.638
Nab all those who went to the top today

12:05.784 --> 12:07.253
and take them back to Supreme Court.

12:14.497 --> 12:17.272
Donglai, you come with me to the Palace.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.128
Everybody else guards over here.

12:19.922 --> 12:21.253
This case is very important.

12:21.454 --> 12:24.499
I need to report to the Empress in person.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.600
Yes, Sir!

12:47.615 --> 12:51.000
Your Majesty, General Yao just entered,

12:51.001 --> 12:54.089
leading 200 soldiers from Longzhou.

12:54.090 --> 12:57.001
Following behind is General Qiu,

12:57.202 --> 13:00.002
with an army of 600 to protect Your Majesty.

13:04.203 --> 13:06.003
Your Majesty, Master Xue of Supreme Court

13:06.204 --> 13:07.860
and his subordinate Pei request an interview!

13:08.571 --> 13:09.558
Let them approach!

13:21.956 --> 13:24.099
Your Majesty, Pei Donglai of Supreme Court.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.956
Regarding the torched death of Jia Yi,

13:27.057 --> 13:28.413
my preliminary investigation indicates...

13:40.412 --> 13:41.099
Protect Her Majesty!

13:41.188 --> 13:42.251
Protect Her Majesty!

14:20.044 --> 14:22.290
The Empress hereby decrees:

14:22.491 --> 14:25.163
2000 more imperial guards shall

14:25.264 --> 14:27.464
be garrisoned inside the palace.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.365
Going in or out without permits

14:29.566 --> 14:31.589
is punishable by death without reprieve.

14:33.602 --> 14:35.736
All flames were replaced by night pearls.

14:36.037 --> 14:37.737
Even the stoves were extinguished!

14:37.838 --> 14:39.726
All food and drinks came from outside...

14:40.127 --> 14:41.952
The Empress has not eaten much.

14:42.053 --> 14:43.053
She's probably still worried...

14:50.698 --> 14:53.784
Your Majesty...Your Majesty.

14:56.533 --> 14:57.800
I'm not hungry!

14:58.536 --> 14:59.501
The coronation is imminent.

14:59.702 --> 15:01.108
Your Majesty should mind your health.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.756
I've even ordered your favorite soup.

15:13.229 --> 15:16.199
You don't need to test-eat anymore.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.375
Leave that to your subordinates.

15:20.025 --> 15:21.232
Your Majesty has saved my life.

15:22.156 --> 15:26.966
I live and die for Your Majesty.

15:28.867 --> 15:30.425
Remember...

15:31.787 --> 15:32.901
you have to stay alive.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.692
Only then can you defeat your enemies.

15:37.793 --> 15:39.901
Since I entered the palace at the age of 14,

15:40.202 --> 15:42.102
I've braved through crises after crises.

15:43.586 --> 15:46.069
Had I been careless, I'd have been crushed

15:47.845 --> 15:52.342
and no woman would ever ascend the throne.

15:55.843 --> 15:58.843
Your Majesty, dinner is safe to eat.

16:12.974 --> 16:18.630
The Imperial Chaplain's Magic Deer is here.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.812
Everything is transient

16:32.016 --> 16:33.536
follow Heaven's Mandate.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.763
Welcome, Chaplain.

16:37.675 --> 16:39.399
Everyone, on your knees!

16:39.456 --> 16:40.608
Yes, Your Majesty.

16:42.390 --> 16:44.398
The astronomical phenomena
have been chaotic.

16:44.399 --> 16:46.426
An evil availed of my spiritual sabbatical

16:46.427 --> 16:49.586
to disturb the royal soil against nature.

16:49.987 --> 16:52.406
Would the Chaplain please enlighten me?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.605
The evil has been committing crimes

16:54.806 --> 16:57.469
as Venus has left the Palace for 8 years.

16:57.670 --> 17:00.570
It's being locked up and has not returned.

17:00.856 --> 17:05.499
Locked up? Is Venus a prisoner?

17:06.700 --> 17:11.368
Venus originated from Yang Qui of Di City.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.625
Left the Palace for 8 years?

17:14.126 --> 17:15.826
Originated from Dee City?

17:16.027 --> 17:19.365
Does the Chaplain mean Detective Dee?

17:20.801 --> 17:22.866
8 years ago, Dee opposed your regency

17:23.067 --> 17:24.856
and was jailed for treason.

17:25.057 --> 17:25.944
If we release him,

17:26.146 --> 17:28.175
the dissenters will become more recalcitrant!

17:28.976 --> 17:30.976
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

17:31.502 --> 17:33.986
As soon as Venus has returned,

17:34.187 --> 17:38.754
chaos will end and all stars are at peace.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.904
Find out whether Dee is dead or alive?

17:52.703 --> 17:54.625
<i>((Ministery Building))</i>

17:57.226 --> 17:58.696
Welcome, Officer Shangguan.

18:00.756 --> 18:02.897
<i>((Linking Office))</i>

18:03.015 --> 18:04.947
"Dong Jin of Jiang Nan reported that he wants to
The South needs 6,000 soldiers to suppress the barbarians....

18:05.148 --> 18:06.448
Memorial to be transferred to Military Dept.

18:06.849 --> 18:08.011
The South also reported that...

18:08.212 --> 18:10.389
the river flooding destroyed houses and farmlands.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.687
Memorial to be transferred to Public Works Dept.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.156
The South has been such a mess lately.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.383
After the flood came the plague.

18:23.038 --> 18:25.056
Here come the memorials to the throne.

18:27.035 --> 18:28.622
Hurry up and burn the memorials.

18:28.723 --> 18:31.385
Stop nagging like a girl. Get to work!

18:33.131 --> 18:35.679
Memorials are prescriptions for the state.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.033
We know the state's illness by reading them.

18:39.539 --> 18:41.895
But the memorials in recent years show that

18:42.396 --> 18:43.856
people's livelihood has improved

18:43.857 --> 18:45.308
and they are living in contentment.

18:48.574 --> 18:50.469
So what?

18:51.336 --> 18:54.215
You really think you can get out of here?

18:54.516 --> 18:55.472
Ling...

18:56.513 --> 18:57.796
Yes...

19:00.331 --> 19:02.497
Perhaps it's time I left here.

19:02.598 --> 19:04.198
What are you talking about?

19:14.262 --> 19:17.302
Oh! I hear that! Quite a few men...

19:18.549 --> 19:21.103
You said if you were to leave here alive,

19:21.204 --> 19:23.432
you might have to fight a big battle...

19:24.246 --> 19:25.755
A battle of life and death.

19:25.956 --> 19:26.801
Remember what I taught you?

19:27.002 --> 19:28.702
Got it!

20:12.503 --> 20:13.590
Push the cart!

20:42.546 --> 20:43.649
20cm to the left!

20:44.350 --> 20:45.230
1cm below!

20:48.050 --> 20:48.865
Do it again!

21:14.687 --> 21:15.912
Kill the assassins!

21:16.113 --> 21:17.360
Very quick! Very quick movement!

21:17.461 --> 21:18.361
Kill the assassins!

21:21.226 --> 21:22.021
Protect Her Excellency!

21:22.122 --> 21:23.011
Get lost!

21:26.134 --> 21:27.807
Watch out! Someone's on the roof!

21:28.008 --> 21:30.608
Hidden arrows! Bend over!

21:35.926 --> 21:37.052
No, they are going to jump!

21:37.353 --> 21:41.075
Don't let the assassins flee! Nab them alive!

21:50.701 --> 21:51.634
They all died.

21:51.935 --> 21:52.895
You follow me up!

21:52.896 --> 21:54.554
Don't let anyone flee, dead or alive!

21:54.755 --> 21:58.700
Yes!

22:00.925 --> 22:02.901
You! Go after the archer on the roof!

22:03.002 --> 22:04.109
Yes!

22:09.022 --> 22:10.582
No need to chase.

22:10.883 --> 22:12.316
This is a maximum security prison,

22:12.517 --> 22:13.817
and yet they can come and go at ease.

22:14.018 --> 22:15.639
They must be abetted by someone inside.

22:17.175 --> 22:18.453
Nonsense!

22:19.354 --> 22:21.389
How can the killers be our men?

22:21.690 --> 22:25.456
The killers from outside must
know someone from inside.

22:25.702 --> 22:28.389
These people are too powerful for you.

22:28.558 --> 22:30.358
Perhaps not for her.

22:31.259 --> 22:33.187
This official is elegantly dressed

22:33.388 --> 22:34.588
with an impressing bearing.

22:34.789 --> 22:36.213
It doesn't look like you're from here.

22:36.953 --> 22:39.314
I bet you're from the Palace.

22:45.315 --> 22:46.674
No need.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.717
He's really blind.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.618
Why did you feign blindness?

22:55.801 --> 22:57.219
The world is marked by misfortunes.

22:57.220 --> 23:02.024
I tried to stay away but failed after all.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.783
If I'm blind like him

23:06.984 --> 23:08.113
I can be at peace.

23:08.314 --> 23:09.844
Your prediction is right on track.

23:10.145 --> 23:12.275
You said the day that trouble found you

23:12.329 --> 23:14.129
would be the day you could leave jail.

23:14.230 --> 23:16.028
It's a pity we can't leave together.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.062
I got nothing to do with the world outside.

23:19.263 --> 23:23.201
But you never manage to extricate yourself.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.849
Thanks for keeping me company all this time.

23:26.150 --> 23:28.639
We are beyond such formality.

23:28.945 --> 23:32.074
Perhaps you'll discover that being outside

23:32.375 --> 23:35.521
is not as free as being inside.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.658
You think I'm right?

23:58.847 --> 24:03.189
Military examination in the year 689!

24:03.690 --> 24:07.377
On the right is Chen from Xiangzhou

24:07.611 --> 24:09.347
his weapon will be the iron rod.

24:09.799 --> 24:13.117
On the left is Yen from Yangzhou

24:13.318 --> 24:15.323
his weapon will be the meteor hammer.

24:15.756 --> 24:18.188
The tournament begins!

24:37.012 --> 24:39.236
Your Majesty, Dee has been brought here.

24:40.116 --> 24:42.104
You knew you're coming to see me,

24:42.255 --> 24:43.869
but you're still in prison clothes

24:44.370 --> 24:46.403
and you didn't even shave?

24:46.476 --> 24:48.725
Years ago when I opposed your regency,

24:48.900 --> 24:50.193
I had already been accused of treason.

24:50.294 --> 24:52.056
Now that your coronation is imminent,

24:52.257 --> 24:54.014
even if I got out of these prison clothes,

24:54.115 --> 24:55.698
I might have to put them on again soon...

24:55.899 --> 24:56.699
So I decided not to change.

24:56.900 --> 24:57.700
Leave us alone.

24:59.901 --> 25:02.463
Leave us alone. You too, Jing'er.

25:03.638 --> 25:04.889
Yes, Your Majesty.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.105
The Crown Prince was very little then.

25:23.499 --> 25:26.012
I helped him rule as an Empress Dowager.

25:26.213 --> 25:27.529
What's wrong with that?

25:27.730 --> 25:29.476
And yet you had to oppose.

25:29.677 --> 25:31.259
During my rule for the last 8 years,

25:31.887 --> 25:34.978
the state is incorrupt and the people rich.

25:35.079 --> 25:38.514
Even the Prince begged me
in writing to ascend the throne.

25:39.258 --> 25:41.710
What more can you say?

25:41.911 --> 25:43.698
Nothing.

25:45.321 --> 25:48.036
You men are just not used to women in power.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.674
One can't be conservative in state matters

25:51.483 --> 25:52.677
but has to reform constantly.

25:53.485 --> 25:54.543
Reform is good,

25:54.653 --> 25:56.484
but all new things will turn old one day.

25:56.522 --> 25:57.648
While the old are being replaced by the new,

25:58.524 --> 26:02.492
if that involves their lives as well,
then rebellions become inevitable.

26:03.528 --> 26:06.620
Not only men...even dogs will try to flee.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.633
Detective Dee is still Detective Dee.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.705
Your words are so hurtful to the ears.

26:27.586 --> 26:31.146
That was your badge.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.615
I'm returning it to you.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.590
You shall be my Imperial Commissioner

26:35.661 --> 26:37.458
in charge of the Phantom Flame Case.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.588
You shall work with Supreme Court

26:40.499 --> 26:43.559
to crack the case before my coronation!

27:07.759 --> 27:09.522
Why do you keep following me?

27:10.629 --> 27:13.454
Her Majesty knows you've suffered in jail

27:13.599 --> 27:15.933
and specifically ordered me to serve you.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.727
You have such a murderous look.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.930
It must be a pain to be served by you!

27:29.648 --> 27:30.580
So lively here?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.407
There are more people inside the inn.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.518
The Prince of Lanya is having a banquet.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.646
Li Xiao commands an army of 100,000

27:37.689 --> 27:38.587
and is haughty because of his royal status.

27:38.690 --> 27:39.957
He is at loggerheads with the Empress

27:40.492 --> 27:41.916
and has long intended to revolt.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.586
He must be involved in this case.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.554
You better check him out.

27:46.531 --> 27:47.555
Having the intention to revolt

27:47.699 --> 27:49.323
does not mean he's involved in this case.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.592
You better get it right.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.541
These are your clothings before you were jailed.

28:01.713 --> 28:03.904
Only my Dragon Taming Mace is missing.

28:05.651 --> 28:06.640
It's getting late.

28:07.619 --> 28:11.521
You want to stay here with me?

28:16.295 --> 28:17.462
Have you forgotten?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.887
Her Majesty has ordered me to serve you.

28:25.570 --> 28:26.628
To serve me?

28:45.624 --> 28:46.682
Huh? What are you standing there for?

28:46.792 --> 28:49.619
Get me some water. I need to shave.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.931
You call this service?

28:57.602 --> 29:00.503
Look at you! Neither male nor a...

29:02.507 --> 29:03.667
That's how you serve people?

29:04.609 --> 29:05.667
That's how I serve you!

29:27.766 --> 29:30.633
I've given you the blade.

29:31.636 --> 29:34.327
Come, shave for me.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.680
The Empress asked you to serve me,

29:43.548 --> 29:44.674
but don't take it in face value.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.582
She wants you to spy on me...

29:47.619 --> 29:49.484
...but also to test you...

29:49.755 --> 29:54.915
I'll report every word to Her Majesty.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.729
All right, let me tell you this.

29:58.563 --> 29:59.689
She does not believe in anyone.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.591
If we really become together,

30:02.734 --> 30:05.464
her intense suspicion

30:06.171 --> 30:08.530
will turn her against you.

30:09.674 --> 30:11.608
Why do you stop shaving?

30:11.710 --> 30:12.734
My beard is not there...

30:14.646 --> 30:16.580
It's here.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.487
I suggest you tell her...

30:22.521 --> 30:24.512
...we can't get along.

30:24.689 --> 30:27.623
That will set her mind at peace.

30:28.527 --> 30:32.496
Let me see if she is what you said she is.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.438
Don't make it difficult for yourself.

30:48.547 --> 30:52.710
If you don't want it, don't force yourself.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.545
But do you want it?

31:34.726 --> 31:36.489
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.721
I gave you the whip. You still didn't get it?

32:29.614 --> 32:30.603
Don't touch me.

33:04.749 --> 33:10.585
There're assasins! Move and hide!

33:11.489 --> 33:14.515
I've been waiting for you, Brother Dee.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.620
Why aren't you on your knees?

33:18.563 --> 33:21.589
I'm chasing suspects. No time for formality.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.564
What suspects are you chasing?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.628
The Phantom Flame was staged by the Chaplain

33:26.738 --> 33:27.762
under the order of the Empress!

33:29.474 --> 33:31.499
She wants to usurp the throne

33:31.676 --> 33:33.576
and eliminate old officials like us.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.706
I'm occupied. See you later!

33:37.215 --> 33:39.745
Dee, receive the Military Tally!

33:40.685 --> 33:42.653
With this tally, you can deploy any troops.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.655
In view of your loyal nature,

33:45.057 --> 33:47.548
I'm inviting you to join my Army of Justice.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.718
I'm in command of 100,000 soldiers

33:50.562 --> 33:52.530
and have a fail-proof plan

33:52.631 --> 33:54.489
to overturn ...

33:54.505 --> 33:57.564
...the evil empress!

33:58.765 --> 33:59.565
Assasins!

33:59.566 --> 34:01.566
Protect the Duke!

34:03.609 --> 34:06.440
That's outrageous, Li Xiao!

34:06.578 --> 34:08.545
How dare you rave like that?

34:10.483 --> 34:12.574
I won't chat with you

34:12.650 --> 34:15.518
now that she's here.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.679
But remember,

34:18.090 --> 34:19.614
one of these days...

34:19.891 --> 34:23.552
you'll grovel before me

34:23.829 --> 34:26.463
and take my orders.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.724
Remember!

34:28.867 --> 34:32.695
Grovel before me and take my orders...

34:33.505 --> 34:34.529
He's hopeless. Let's go.

34:34.606 --> 34:35.697
You will ruin your integrety!

34:40.478 --> 34:42.503
He must have ordered the kill just now.

34:42.547 --> 34:43.571
Why kills me...

34:43.681 --> 34:45.706
if he wants to buy me off?

34:46.685 --> 34:48.143
He wants you dead as he can't buy you off.

34:48.752 --> 34:49.783
No...

34:53.853 --> 34:56.685
...he doesn't want me dead.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.665
It's someone else who does.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.526
The Empress hereby decrees:

35:05.704 --> 35:08.639
Mysterious cases are rampant lately.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.537
Theses are works of villains

35:10.675 --> 35:11.699
who are spreading fallacies to cheat people.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.641
I hereby appoint Dee as Imperial Commissioner

35:13.745 --> 35:15.542
to lead Supreme Court to solve the

35:15.680 --> 35:18.672
Phantom Flame Case

35:19.517 --> 35:20.541
before my Coronation.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.819
I humbly receive the Imperial Edict.

35:23.588 --> 35:28.353
Commissioner, you do have a unique style.

35:28.490 --> 35:30.384
You bring your bird out while on duty?

35:30.525 --> 35:32.459
Don't underestimate it.

35:32.561 --> 35:34.454
It can solve crime.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.558
Where's the sun so early in the morning?

35:42.540 --> 35:46.509
This is the mortuary. This way, please.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.578
The bird is afraid to go in.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.688
Find someone outside to take care of it.

36:09.768 --> 36:14.603
The deceased was Jia of the 4th rank,

36:14.739 --> 36:17.503
Vice Minister of Public Works.

36:17.642 --> 36:20.611
On the 17th day of the 8th month, 1-3pm...

36:20.712 --> 36:26.039
he was self-burnt to ashes inside the Buddha,

36:27.552 --> 36:29.046
What do you think of this case?

36:36.528 --> 36:38.553
Go watch over the ''evidence'' outside.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.500
I was ordered to follow you closely.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.395
You want to return this badge to the Empress?

36:53.678 --> 36:58.212
Don't touch the evidence or get too close!

36:58.516 --> 37:00.176
Shut the door!

37:13.598 --> 37:15.524
Keep reading.

37:16.701 --> 37:20.603
The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...

37:20.705 --> 37:21.637
Louder!

37:23.708 --> 37:25.642
The deceased was Xue...

37:34.552 --> 37:35.576
You can speak now.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.660
The murder technique is not human.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.657
Cut the generality. You're not to the point.

37:47.465 --> 37:48.489
Who do you think it is?

37:50.768 --> 37:55.671
Rumor has it that the Chaplain Lu Li

37:55.773 --> 37:57.638
is on a murder spree before the Coronation.

38:08.486 --> 38:10.545
To set an example and warn the dissenters

38:10.655 --> 38:12.713
not to act rashly.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.622
Jia was sent by the Empress.

38:14.659 --> 38:15.626
Why killed him?

38:16.494 --> 38:18.485
She's unfathomable.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.631
I read Jia's memorials before.

38:21.699 --> 38:22.723
He inspected the Buddha every month.

38:23.568 --> 38:24.694
The time-table for the Buddha is very tight.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.494
Wouldn't killing him hinder the Coronation?

38:29.774 --> 38:33.733
You read Master Jia's memorials?

38:34.612 --> 38:36.546
I read memorials at the Liaison Office

38:36.648 --> 38:38.479
before they were burnt every day.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.613
Moving the amulet causes divine intervention.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.520
The Chaplain is killing with black magic.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.526
You believe all this nonsense?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.595
It's evident. Why can't I believe it?

38:51.696 --> 38:52.720
You're lying.

38:54.532 --> 38:57.695
We both know the amulets are just a front.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.494
The murderer is trying to hide the truth.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.602
She's still spying on us.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.480
Let's play her.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.681
According to your theory,

39:20.592 --> 39:23.493
you'll be promoted after Xue died.

39:23.628 --> 39:24.686
That makes you a suspect as well.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.592
Then why do you think I killed Master Jia?

39:33.671 --> 39:35.571
You killed Master Jia as a diversion.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.608
Your real target is your superior.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.472
That fits your hypothesis squarely.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.545
Perhaps your real goal

39:44.682 --> 39:46.479
is to thwart the Coronation.

39:49.654 --> 39:50.712
Don't stop.

39:51.656 --> 39:52.623
I'm done...

39:52.757 --> 39:55.487
Start again till I ask you to stop.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.554
Twice already. There's nothing to read!

40:03.534 --> 40:07.662
The deceased Detective Dee
is fighting with Minister Pei.

40:07.772 --> 40:08.739
You're framing me!

40:09.540 --> 40:10.632
Didn't you ask us to play her?

40:15.647 --> 40:19.640
I was acting. Couldn't you tell?

40:29.627 --> 40:31.652
Sir... the birdcage is on fire, Master Pei!

40:32.530 --> 40:34.521
Sir... Sir...

40:34.522 --> 40:35.922
What's the matter?

40:35.923 --> 40:36.923
I don't know.

40:39.537 --> 40:40.595
What's the matter?

40:40.705 --> 40:42.696
Detective Dee!

40:42.740 --> 40:44.931
Your evidence is aflame like those officials.

40:45.576 --> 40:46.834
Let's go to the kitchen.

40:53.551 --> 40:54.518
What's for lunch?

40:55.553 --> 40:56.679
Stir-fried cucumbers with snow lotus.

40:57.488 --> 40:58.477
Any chicken blood?

40:58.623 --> 40:59.521
Over there.

40:59.657 --> 41:00.624
What's he doing?

41:00.725 --> 41:03.826
He probably found out why
the victims caught fire.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.910
Master Xue caught fire at 3-5pm

41:30.722 --> 41:32.587
when the sun descended towards the west.

41:33.558 --> 41:36.153
The Buddha was surrounded by shadows.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.495
But once he's in the drill ground,
he started catching fire.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.494
because the drill ground was uncovered.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.568
So I infer that the sun triggers the poison!

41:54.579 --> 41:56.547
Let's stay away from this.

42:40.725 --> 42:41.589
Watch out.

43:04.549 --> 43:05.573
Detective Dee!

43:08.486 --> 43:10.545
Fancy seeing you again before I die!

43:11.656 --> 43:12.980
That's Fate.

43:13.658 --> 43:16.850
We're kept alive for a purpose.

43:23.634 --> 43:25.499
You're back in Supreme Court?

43:26.671 --> 43:31.608
The Empress put me in charge
of the Phantom Flame Case.

43:33.678 --> 43:35.509
Dee's position is unclear.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.511
We can't let him dupe us.

43:37.648 --> 43:40.481
Let's join forces and watch over him.

43:40.585 --> 43:41.711
Join forces?

43:42.553 --> 43:43.679
I work directly under the Empress.

43:44.555 --> 43:45.715
It's not up to you to make suggestions.

44:07.545 --> 44:08.534
What's the matter?

44:09.647 --> 44:12.582
Before the accidents, both officials

44:12.750 --> 44:14.741
did one thing besides

44:15.620 --> 44:17.588
moving the amulets.

44:19.757 --> 44:20.746
What is it?

44:21.259 --> 44:22.526
Drinking water.

44:22.727 --> 44:27.663
They both drank the water here

44:28.633 --> 44:32.735
and they were killed by intaking that liquid poison.

44:35.340 --> 44:36.732
But that can't be!

44:37.708 --> 44:39.642
I was supposed to move the amulet first.

44:39.744 --> 44:41.609
Master Xue just happened to come before me.

44:41.779 --> 44:44.612
If the murderer killed because of the amulet,

44:44.749 --> 44:47.582
how did he know Master Xue would snatch it

44:47.618 --> 44:49.677
and poison the water beforehand?

44:50.621 --> 44:53.522
It should have nothing to do with the water.

44:54.659 --> 44:58.527
You work directly under the Empress.

44:58.663 --> 45:00.631
Do you need to hear my humble opinion?

45:05.503 --> 45:06.561
After I was in jail,

45:06.671 --> 45:08.129
I kept professing my loyalty in writing.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.473
Eventually the Empress pardoned me.

45:10.675 --> 45:12.472
I joined the Department of Public Works,

45:12.610 --> 45:14.669
in charge of repairing royal palaces.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.573
I was then made supervisor of the Buddha.

45:20.484 --> 45:22.577
In other words, I've been promoted.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.487
How magnificent!

45:28.693 --> 45:31.524
The Tubular Pillar in the Book of Fanyanna?

45:31.528 --> 45:34.654
Yes, I was inspired

45:35.566 --> 45:37.557
by the Fanyanna Buddha.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.659
The pillar's base is 100 feet underground.

45:40.504 --> 45:43.564
It can withstand earthquakes

45:43.674 --> 45:45.539
and hurricanes.

45:48.512 --> 45:50.072
This is the top level of the Buddha.

45:51.549 --> 45:55.508
Master Jia died inside the Buddha's left eye.

46:04.562 --> 46:05.922
You were also re-enacting the case?

46:09.700 --> 46:11.531
After working under you for so many years,

46:11.635 --> 46:13.660
I've been used to case re-enactment.

46:15.606 --> 46:16.864
So what have you learnt?

46:19.577 --> 46:20.635
Fire turtles...

46:21.712 --> 46:23.543
What are fire turtles?

46:24.682 --> 46:26.916
You also read Book of Fanyanna.

46:27.551 --> 46:31.514
Remember the section on fire turtles?

46:31.622 --> 46:33.487
What?

46:34.725 --> 46:37.894
The most venomous beetles in Western Regions.

46:38.529 --> 46:39.587
They feed on yellow phosphorus

46:39.730 --> 46:41.561
and their bodies catch fire under the sun.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.568
So the beetles are related to the two deaths?

46:46.537 --> 46:48.528
I witnessed what happened that day.

46:48.706 --> 46:52.503
Only later did I think of the fire turtles.

46:52.741 --> 46:55.933
Stop it, Donglai!

46:57.615 --> 46:58.673
You knew this clue all along.

46:59.517 --> 47:02.643
Why did you rant about divine intervention?

47:03.621 --> 47:05.612
As a menial

47:05.723 --> 47:08.692
I used my wit when threatened.

47:09.593 --> 47:11.584
To be honest, even if I'd told you my theory,

47:11.762 --> 47:15.664
given your wisdom, you wouldn't believe it.

47:17.635 --> 47:18.624
You son of a bitch!

47:19.503 --> 47:21.630
Calm down. I've known him for years.

47:21.772 --> 47:23.501
That's how he is.

47:27.813 --> 47:28.906
Come!

47:28.907 --> 47:31.907
Detain him for extreme torture later.

47:31.908 --> 47:32.908
Yes.

47:32.909 --> 47:33.909
Stop!

47:35.753 --> 47:36.651
Dong Lai.

47:37.621 --> 47:39.589
The Empress has asked me to lead the case.

47:40.591 --> 47:42.615
I can decide everything without intervention.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.489
All of you stand down!

47:47.665 --> 47:49.724
What other clues do you have? Spit it out!

47:50.734 --> 47:52.531
I'm only speculating.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.467
After all, fire turtles are not indigenous.

47:55.573 --> 47:56.699
For more details

47:57.641 --> 47:59.506
we need help...

48:00.544 --> 48:01.602
Phantom Bazaar.

48:04.515 --> 48:05.573
What is Phantom Bazaar?

48:07.685 --> 48:11.676
It's a spooky pandemonium.

48:11.687 --> 48:15.655
High officials like you would never go there.

48:17.561 --> 48:18.585
Shatuo...

48:20.598 --> 48:22.566
you still remember Donkey Wang?

48:25.603 --> 48:27.628
Luoyang City was built

48:27.738 --> 48:29.706
a thousand years ago.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.533
The old city subsided during Han Dynasty.

48:32.710 --> 48:34.610
A new city was built on top in Sui Dynasty.

48:34.645 --> 48:35.634
The underground became

48:35.713 --> 48:38.913
a black market.

48:39.017 --> 48:40.709
They call it Phantom Bazaar.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.573
Who ordered a boat?

49:07.678 --> 49:09.578
We ordered a boat to Dr Donkey Wang.

49:09.747 --> 49:11.014
You know the place?

49:11.549 --> 49:12.943
Wang the Donkey with Scabies?

49:14.684 --> 49:19.251
Five silver coins. Nonrefundable!

50:00.598 --> 50:03.590
Anybody here?

50:17.715 --> 50:18.647
Hey!

50:21.719 --> 50:23.687
You're still alive, Detective Dee?

50:23.787 --> 50:26.618
Scram! This is no place for official curs!

50:26.623 --> 50:28.312
I'm here to save you.

50:28.491 --> 50:32.515
Save me? No, I'm fine!

50:32.692 --> 50:35.118
I don't want trouble!

50:40.471 --> 50:41.563
Now that I'm here

50:41.739 --> 50:44.128
your good days are over.

50:44.740 --> 50:45.729
True.

50:46.577 --> 50:49.301
You always bring me troubles.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.704
I'm really so sorry.

50:52.516 --> 50:53.540
If you don't go, I'll go.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.679
I'll move house.

51:03.627 --> 51:05.618
Pei! Give me the money!

51:16.707 --> 51:18.641
What do you want to know?

51:18.742 --> 51:20.573
Ever heard of fire turtles?

51:25.616 --> 51:29.643
Fire turtles? This creature...

51:29.720 --> 51:30.744
It has been reported that they're extinct.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.483
I have no idea.

51:32.556 --> 51:34.323
Could it be they exist in Central Plains?

51:34.758 --> 51:35.990
It's no use.

51:41.632 --> 51:44.624
You won't solve this case!

51:44.735 --> 51:45.702
Pay up!

51:46.503 --> 51:47.492
Don't worry.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.503
Tell us first and I'll pay.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.641
I'll only tell you after you've paid.

51:52.977 --> 51:53.938
What is it?

51:55.546 --> 51:57.480
I'll pay after you've told us.

51:59.283 --> 52:00.709
I'll only speak after you've paid.
Stay away!

52:29.713 --> 52:30.945
There's somebody above!

52:35.753 --> 52:37.618
Hey, where's Detective Dee?

52:37.688 --> 52:39.713
He's chasing Dr Wang!

54:35.772 --> 54:37.636
It's the Imperial Chaplain!

54:38.542 --> 54:39.531
Impossible!

55:00.497 --> 55:03.522
Split! Can't you split? Split!

55:39.536 --> 55:41.527
You get in first.

57:19.603 --> 57:21.468
Jing'er is in trouble! I'll help her!

57:44.594 --> 57:46.585
Donglai! Jing'er! Move!

58:03.714 --> 58:04.681
Who is he?

58:05.582 --> 58:06.742
Why does the Chaplain want to kill him?

58:07.551 --> 58:08.518
He's not the Chaplain!

58:08.618 --> 58:09.585
How can you be so sure?

58:09.720 --> 58:11.585
I've seen the Chaplain! I'm positive he is...

58:19.563 --> 58:20.757
Hey! The Chaplain is over there!

58:23.667 --> 58:24.691
It's he again!

58:32.743 --> 58:33.641
Jing'er!

58:34.544 --> 58:35.476
That's diversion.

58:37.781 --> 58:38.713
But Jing'er is by herself...

58:39.616 --> 58:41.584
She wants to find his identity more than we.

58:42.486 --> 58:43.578
Their target is Wang. We need to protect him.

58:43.620 --> 58:44.712
Jing'er knows where to find us.

58:46.757 --> 58:49.922
Stop wasting time and follow me!

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.813
Jing'er?

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:35.521
Almighty infinity? Infinity Monastery?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.443
There's nobody here. Stop pretending.

01:01:58.748 --> 01:01:59.680
Take your pin out.

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:04.484
I was fine down there.

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:06.580
Why dragged me up?

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.650
Speak up! Where can we find fire turtles?

01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:11.683
If I can crack this case,

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.491
I'll help you get back to the Palace.

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.521
To hell with it! Who wants to go back?

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.575
I advise you not to take up this case!

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:30.466
You can't mess with the people behind it.

01:02:30.712 --> 01:02:35.143
It can't be done... and then... and then...

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:37.577
Your transfiguration

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:40.689
makes you inarticulate.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:41.714
Let me see.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:43.549
Don't touch

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.686
these two acupoints!

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:47.730
They are anathema

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.494
to transfiguration!

01:02:56.499 --> 01:02:57.523
Don't touch me!

01:02:58.272 --> 01:02:59.501
What's the matter?

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:00.634
Nothing. I thought of someone.

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.169
Like you, she didn't let me touch her.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.078
Who?

01:03:08.486 --> 01:03:11.144
It's all right. It's Donglai.

01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:28.571
Who is he?

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:30.700
The Imperial Physician, Wang Bo.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.635
A.K.A. Donkey Wang.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.703
He's Donkey Wang?

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.674
Could that be the so-called transfiguration?

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:44.553
Well, it's my first time.

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:48.489
That's petty stuff. What's so special?

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.626
We wasted our whole evening on him.

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:53.524
What's this piece of crap good for?

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:56.689
Who is she? So arrogant!

01:03:56.799 --> 01:04:02.368
Officer Shangguan, the Empress's favorite.

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:04.607
So you are Shangguan Jing'er?

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.669
You are the Empress's bitch?

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:20.688
Let go of me!

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:22.657
We need torture to make him talk!

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.584
A confession under torture is useless.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.530
Don't you know that it's torture

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.691
which alienates people from the Empress

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.466
and go against her?

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.472
The fire turtles you're looking for

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:42.545
were used for the late Emperor's asthenia.

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:45.578
I heard about them

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:47.479
from Western people

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.586
and decided to use them to treat asthenia.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.687
I presented a memorial to the late Emperor.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.514
The late Emperor personally commanded

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:58.626
Western merchants to present him 20 of them.

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:00.520
We soon discovered that

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.621
they had no medical value.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.500
In fact, they were a very lethal poison.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.472
Once ingested, one would burn under the sun.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.605
That's the symptom of the Phantom Flame Case!

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:13.664
After this failure

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.705
I fled for my life.

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.479
Before I fled, I exposed them under the sun,

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:22.676
hoping they would be exterminated.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:26.550
But in a rush, I'm not sure if they died out.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.554
So where did you keep the fire turtles?

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:33.719
It's where Infinity Monastery is now.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:36.495
You try to harm Infinity Monastery and the Chaplain.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:37.600
Let me kill you now.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:41.694
Jing'er, the Chaplain can help his case.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.732
Can you tell him

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.538
I want to talk to him?

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:47.608
What about?

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:49.610
I want to know...

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.471
why the Chaplain wants me to handle the case.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.639
The Chaplain is so powerful.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:56.184
Couldn't he just tell me who did it?

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:01.349
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:04.624
Then I'll go to the Monastery to find him.

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:07.728
Detective Dee, you can't just go there.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:10.662
I know, without the Imperial Edict,

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.601
trespassers are punishable by death.

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:16.761
Please tell the Chaplain I must see him,

01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:21.139
whether he wants to or not.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.846
You are wavered.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:44.531
Apparently, Dee is at the end of his tether.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:52.163
No need to see him anymore. I'll handle it.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:55.678
Remember!

01:06:56.546 --> 01:07:00.504
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.585
One needs to be committed absolutely.

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:21.190
If fire turtles are found in the Monastery,

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:23.469
then the Chaplain has to be involved.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.197
But what's the Chaplain's murder motive?

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:30.668
Both men moved the amulets before they died.

01:07:30.678 --> 01:07:33.767
I don't believe in divine intervention,

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:37.473
but there might be a clue behind the amulets.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.451
Xue moved it during investigation

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:43.247
Jia moved them while inspecting the tubular pillar.

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:45.526
I think during his inspection,

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.495
Jia must have found something.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:51.595
The clue may be in Jia's inspection report.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:53.868
We have to find this report.

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:57.730
I'll go to Jia's residence tonight.

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:16.147
Pei of Supreme Court welcomes the Prince!

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.993
Detective Dee, receive the mace...

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:50.314
The late Emperor gave you this weapon.

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.593
It was confiscated when you were in jail.

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:56.863
After I got hold of it, I've kept it for you!

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:04.493
Dee, I'm bestowing this mace on you.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.633
If I make mistakes in my rule in future,

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:10.703
you should advise me frankly with this mace.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.712
The Empress has spies everywhere.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.613
You are returning the mace to me in public.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.316
You want the Empress to suspect me?

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.529
I had an agreement with the Empress.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:29.689
I only care about the investigation.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.631
Power struggle is none of my concern.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:41.966
The bitch was right to put you in jail.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.575
You've become a different person.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.906
Dee, do you know how the late Emperor died?

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:59.457
The Empress ordered the Chaplain to kill him!

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.660
Detective Dee!

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:16.002
Get up! Detective Dee!

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.938
I've won!

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.608
You Highness, you've won this time!

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.447
No matter how good Dee is, he can't beat you!

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.716
He kneeled before you after all.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:29.725
Detective Dee is a talent.

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:32.550
Instead of crushing him, we can win him over.

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:35.520
But some people below believe

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.532
he's a threat to our plan

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:39.890
and must be eliminated.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:44.536
Nonsense! So short-sighted!

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.567
Who needs force to subdue Detective Dee?

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.738
To win without fighting, what do you need?

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:53.706
Here!

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:55.575
Yes... you are right.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:02.655
Assasins!

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:06.722
What's wrong with his body?

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:10.623
Look!

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.690
The Prince...

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:04.574
Since you're here, why not have a drink?

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:27.498
This is the mace the late Emperor gave you?

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.574
What's so special about it?

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:32.409
It can detect the crack in a weapon.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:33.580
How?

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:36.513
By hitting the enemy's weapon with this mace,

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:38.644
you can hear the crack...

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.486
When you strike it, it will break!

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.493
Break!

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.535
Men have weak points like weapons.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.710
They will break when struck.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:13.509
Dee, this is your last chance!

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.516
Your Majesty,

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.652
please answer me facing this mace.

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:23.596
How did the late Emperor die?

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.637
You still suspect me after all?

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.707
As reported, he died of liver disease.

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:47.112
Contrary to rumors, I didn't poison him!

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:51.458
I'm ascending the throne on Heaven's Mandate.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.723
But since I'm a woman, I'm being vilified.

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:04.696
You know why I came to see you?

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:07.635
To dissuade me from going to the Monastery.

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:11.975
The Monastery is the Chaplain's retreat.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.446
Nobody ever dared to disturb it.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.982
The murderer is trying to misguide
you and hurt our relationship.

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:21.554
I order you not to investigate the Monastery!

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:24.716
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:27.560
After my coronation,

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:30.555
he will leave the palace.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.468
There's no need to visit him.

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:37.465
Will the Chaplain vanish forever?

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:43.474
Protect Her Majesty!

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.640
Stop! Don't let him in!

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:46.647
Who is this?

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:49.710
I'm looking for Detective Dee.

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.615
Protect the Empress!

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:07.534
Your Majesty!

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.637
Spit it out!

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.666
The Prince...was poisoned
to death...in his residence.

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:18.570
Detective Dee has fled!

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:20.511
That way! He's gone that way!

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:22.974
Go arrest him and the rest stay for the Empress.

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:46.671
Madame Jia, I know you're in mourning,

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:47.733
but our investigation is very urgent.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.637
My apologies for such a late visit.

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:55.516
Two days after my husband's death,

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:57.712
a mysterious fire

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:01.748
burnt down his study.

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:09.555
Why didn't you report it?

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.625
Was I supposed to report it?

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.724
Of course, the cause of fire is suspicious.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:16.466
Someone wants to destroy the evidence.

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.537
It's so important and you...

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:23.233
Madame...

01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:32.454
Is your residence being under renovation?

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:37.625
It leaked earlier, so we're fixing the roof.

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.455
It's been going on

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:40.687
for more than a month.

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:44.462
More than a month?

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.560
That means before Master Jia's accident,

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:48.694
renovation has already begun.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:50.629
Correct.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.738
Such a long renovation for a leak!

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:57.569
So where did he work?

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.705
He moved to the east wing for work.

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:01.540
Show me the way.

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:04.572
Don't move!

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:27.695
Detective Dee!

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.624
You know it's a capital crime to come here.

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.762
Why do you walk right into the trap?

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.731
For saving me from jail,

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:39.666
I must thank you in person.

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:41.669
But you are such a lofty personage.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.637
Why do you need to resort

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:45.611
to ventriloquism?

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:51.641
Detective Dee! You tried all means to see me.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:55.615
Here I am. Say what you have to say.

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:59.719
I heard fire turtles were bred here.

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:02.527
I must ascertain this for my investigation.

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:06.501
Nonsense.

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:07.627
I've been in retreat here for years.

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:09.493
I've never seen any fire turtles.

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:11.664
Leave right away and I'll spare your life.

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:14.703
My life or death is still undetermined.

01:20:15.711 --> 01:20:18.576
But Jing'er, your life is in real danger.

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:23.616
Am I right, Officer Shangguan?

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:27.748
Under the Empress's instructions,

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:29.615
you threw yourself into my arms

01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:31.488
and tried to have sex with me.

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:33.561
But you gave away the show unexpectedly.

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:35.594
You wouldn't let me touch your acupoint...

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.523
That smacked of transfiguration.

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:39.692
When I entered the Monastery just now,

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:42.504
You spoke for the deer with ventriloquism.

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:43.696
Every time the deer appeared,

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:47.733
it's you who spoke for it, right, Jing'er?

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:49.704
In Phantom Bazaar,

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.672
you knew right away the Chaplain was a fake.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:55.608
Is it because you're the same person?

01:20:56.552 --> 01:21:00.543
The Chaplain is Jing'er. Jing'er is him?

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.490
Jing'er...

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:09.621
...it's time to show your real face.

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.657
In order to ascend the throne, the Empress

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.624
eliminated clansmen and old officials,

01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:42.520
blaming everything on the Chaplain.

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:43.756
In order to shut people's mouths,

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.060
she even brought me back to solve the case,

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:48.570
never expecting that I would suspect her.

01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:51.468
She told me the Chaplain would disappear

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.632
after her coronation.

01:21:53.633 --> 01:21:55.633
That's her way of doing things all along.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:00.737
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:02.672
Jing'er,

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.619
You know too many of her secrets.

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:09.715
Once the Chaplain's gone, what about Jing'er?

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.621
It's sleeping smoke.

01:25:57.753 --> 01:25:58.720
Break!

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:22.700
<i>Remember!</i>

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:28.403
<i>To achieve greatness,
everyone is expendable!</i>

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:16.554
I told you not to come here but you did!

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.700
Don't think I'll be grateful

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:24.468
because you've taken the sword for me.

01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:54.559
They should be snared!

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:57.694
Where are they?

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:01.509
Couldn't be far.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.741
Go find them!

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.524
You're awake.

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:30.468
It's good you woke up.

01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.700
Did I hurt you?

01:28:38.747 --> 01:28:42.649
Detective Dee, you're so pathetic.

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:47.588
The world is so big, but you can't fit in.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:52.491
Everybody wants to kill you.

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:56.497
The Empress also asked me to kill you,

01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:59.524
but I cannot.

01:29:06.575 --> 01:29:08.566
Can you take me back?

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:22.581
<i>Your guess is right on track.</i>

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:26.550
<i>The Empress set up Infinity Monastery</i>

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:31.530
<i>to use the Chaplain to eliminate dissenters.</i>

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:37.468
<i>At that time, we did kill many people.</i>

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:41.071
<i>But we didn't cause the Phantom Flame!</i>

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:45.645
<i>The murderer will strike again.</i>

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:51.584
You have to help the Empress!

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:54.645
<i>Find out who the real culprit is.</i>

01:29:57.692 --> 01:30:02.557
Be gentle and careful.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:20.739
Call the Imperial Physician! Hurry up!

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:23.741
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.452
Stand down.

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:37.757
Can I ask you one question, Your Majesty?

01:30:38.758 --> 01:30:39.758
Go ahead.

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:43.465
Have you ever loved one person

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:48.732
in your life?

01:30:54.683 --> 01:30:55.547
Yes.

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:59.652
But the price was too high.

01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:09.287
Was it worth it?

01:31:11.588 --> 01:31:13.588
Was it worth it?

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:18.564
It's worth it.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:50.555
Detective Dee!

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:04.540
We don't have time. No need to untie me.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.538
I know why Jia had to die.

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:11.550
I saw his inspection diagram.

01:33:30.672 --> 01:33:35.666
Rein buckle...

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:10.521
Let's start!

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:11.488
Yes!

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.582
This is the inspection diagram

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:45.659
Pei found in Jia's residence.

01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:48.626
According to Jia's last report,

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:51.620
the Tubular Pillar is different.from the original design.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:57.504
According to Jia's memorial before his death,

01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:00.665
holes were found underneath all amulets.

01:38:01.576 --> 01:38:03.567
Although he did not know the reason,

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.604
he was murdered nonetheless.

01:38:13.488 --> 01:38:16.682
The Towering Buddha is 66 yards high,

01:38:16.691 --> 01:38:20.625
overlooking the palace.
It can fall right upon the coronation stage.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:24.588
The Coronation Ceremony is the best timing.

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:41.479
Xue's death was a camouflage.

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:42.606
You wanted to divert our attention,

01:38:42.717 --> 01:38:44.742
linking the death to the amulets,

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.487
blaming it all on the Imperial Chaplain.

01:38:50.725 --> 01:38:53.455
You also took advantage of our relationship,

01:38:53.628 --> 01:38:55.596
preempting my every move.

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:57.560
Be it to Donkey Wang or to the Monastery,

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:58.690
you managed to set up...

01:38:59.634 --> 01:39:01.534
...ambushes beforehand.

01:39:01.636 --> 01:39:04.694
And you killed Jing'er outside the Monastery.

01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:08.632
What a thorough analysis!

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:12.669
You're indeed the ''Extraordinary Detective''!

01:39:18.753 --> 01:39:23.586
Six years ago, you were the supervisor
when the Monastery was under renovation.

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:27.490
I discovered the remnants
ofthe fire turtles left by Donkey Wang.

01:39:28.763 --> 01:39:30.663
Donglai was right.

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:35.466
The poison entered the body through water.

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:37.604
Jia drank the water but Xue did not.

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.467
After he snatched the amulet,

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:43.630
he didn't drink any water.

01:39:44.612 --> 01:39:47.513
So the poison must have come

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.483
from outside.

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.585
The poison must have seeped through his body.

01:39:57.592 --> 01:39:59.718
Incredible!

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:04.454
Stop it, brother!

01:40:04.532 --> 01:40:06.590
It's baneful to the empire and the people.

01:40:06.701 --> 01:40:08.498
Don't make continuous mistakes.

01:40:09.604 --> 01:40:11.469
Since 8 years ago,

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:16.668
I've only lived for one thing.

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:27.652
She gave me this I have to repay her!

01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.524
Release them!

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:32.579
Tubular pillar...

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:35.682
Molten fluid...

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:21.593
Break!

01:43:27.568 --> 01:43:30.536
8 years ago, you led a revolt against her.

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.671
Now you're giving your life for her.

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:35.542
Where's your integrity?

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:36.608
She might be an evil,

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.506
but you'll be killing more than her.

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:42.539
What kind of monster have you become?

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:52.647
Release the molten fluid!

01:43:52.699 --> 01:43:53.464
Yes!

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:01.694
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:03.662
and melt its base.

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.326
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:07.574
No one will survive in the Palace.

01:44:10.478 --> 01:44:11.638
I know you too well.

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:13.736
I heard you were brought back for the case,

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:17.483
so I advised the Prince to kill you,

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:20.482
or you would ruin our plan.

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:23.588
But that old fool refused to listen.

01:44:23.657 --> 01:44:25.488
He even called me a flunkey,

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:28.593
so I killed him.

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:31.594
Now I have his tally in my hand.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:33.533
100,000 soldiers are outside the city.

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:35.499
Once the Buddha falls down,

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:37.594
they will enter the city to kill the bitch.

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:41.633
Even you can't survive this.

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:54.676
Break!

01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:10.686
<i>The fluid will run into the tubular pillar</i>

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:12.454
<i>...and melt its base.</i>

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.692
<i>The Buddha will fall upon
the coronation stage.</i>

01:46:15.636 --> 01:46:17.661
<i>No one will survive in the Palace.</i>

01:46:21.742 --> 01:46:26.475
The time is ripe and Heaven has spoken.

01:46:26.614 --> 01:46:33.541
Empress Wu is wise, gentle and generous.

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:38.212
For unification, she shall become Emperor.

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:43.527
Let this be known to the world!

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:47.598
Detective Dee... You can't get out!

01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:49.692
I'll let you be buried with the bitch!

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:17.463
Shatuo, your plan has failed!

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.682
I can't stop the Buddha from collapsing,

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:45.524
but the fluid from the southwest has stopped.

01:47:45.693 --> 01:47:47.661
The angle of the collapse will change.

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:49.621
It won't fall upon the coronation stage.

01:47:50.497 --> 01:47:53.660
Oh! I won't give up!

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:06.712
I haven't failed. I haven't.

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.674
After the Buddha has fallen,
the guards will be in panic!

01:48:10.551 --> 01:48:11.518
I haven't failed!

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:17.556
Wait and see. I haven't failed!

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:30.635
Open the door!

01:48:34.675 --> 01:48:35.607
It's collapsing!

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:36.573
Run!

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:10.500
Shatuo! Give up!

01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:12.474
This is your last chance!

01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:17.474
Your Majesty!

01:50:17.578 --> 01:50:18.636
The Towering Buddha is wobbling.

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:19.712
It's falling towards the palace.

01:50:20.514 --> 01:50:21.572
Please take shelter, your Majesty!

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:41.550
I haven't failed.

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:50.625
It's really collapsing!

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:52.726
Your Majesty!
We can't stay here. Let's leave right now.

01:51:53.674 --> 01:51:54.504
Your Majesty!?

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:56.702
Your Majesty!

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:12.546
Protect Her Majesty!Please leave immediately!

01:52:33.547 --> 01:52:37.608
Hey! Don't run that way!

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:18.691
Go save the Emperor

01:53:19.593 --> 01:53:21.618
Your Majesty!?

01:53:22.662 --> 01:53:23.651
Let's go over there.

01:53:36.777 --> 01:53:40.210
Your Majesty!

01:53:44.518 --> 01:53:45.746
It's Detective Dee who saved me...

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.713
A rebel army is gathered 30 miles from here.

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:54.460
They will invade once the Buddha collapses.

01:53:58.665 --> 01:54:00.633
Where's General Yao?

01:54:00.734 --> 01:54:01.723
Yau is here!

01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:04.660
Report the situation outside the city!

01:54:05.539 --> 01:54:06.665
60,000 imperial guards

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:08.701
were in ambush in Bianzhou before daybreak!

01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:13.400
Call General Zhang to lead 100,000 soldiers

01:54:13.614 --> 01:54:16.709
to attack the enemies in the east

01:54:16.817 --> 01:54:18.745
until the rebels are totally demolished.

01:54:19.153 --> 01:54:20.611
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:29.619
You were well prepared indeed.

01:54:32.766 --> 01:54:34.495
Detective Dee,

01:54:35.569 --> 01:54:38.663
from this day onwards,

01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:42.199
the whole world shall know you're my savior.

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.635
May I venture to say a few words to you

01:54:47.514 --> 01:54:50.640
in front of the mace?

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:52.517
Preposterous!

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.509
Stand down.

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:55.584
Your Majesty!

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:58.488
I asked you to stand down!

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:00.521
Stand down, everybody!

01:55:05.532 --> 01:55:08.729
Under Heaven, with this mace as the witness,

01:55:09.703 --> 01:55:15.695
would the sacred Empress Wu please listen:

01:55:18.239 --> 01:55:19.503
On the pretense of magic,

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:22.706
you wantonly killed clansmen and officials.

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:23.708
This is unpardonable!

01:55:24.551 --> 01:55:26.712
But society is on the brink of extinction,

01:55:27.554 --> 01:55:28.680
So your punishment is hereby suspended.

01:55:29.523 --> 01:55:31.616
Ruling requires power and stratagems,

01:55:32.492 --> 01:55:34.517
but right and wrong cannot be confused!

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:36.685
May the Emperor know her every move,

01:55:38.465 --> 01:55:40.524
and let Tang clansmen succeed her,

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.726
so that everything will be back to track.

01:55:46.573 --> 01:55:48.473
You called me ''Emperor''?

01:55:49.676 --> 01:55:53.476
Long live the Emperor! Long Live!

01:56:01.621 --> 01:56:05.589
Officials are lazy nobody can help me.

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:10.688
For the people, you stay and help me.

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:14.589
I've been in rebellion several times.

01:56:15.502 --> 01:56:18.662
How dare I meddle with state affairs?

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:24.734
My assignment is over.

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:28.681
I'm returning this mace to the late Emperor.

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.490
The truth has come to light...

01:57:11.725 --> 01:57:14.523
The world is at peace finally...

01:57:14.728 --> 01:57:18.630
But Detective Dee is in Phantom Bazaar.

01:57:22.502 --> 01:57:24.527
Whether your fire turtle poison is curable

01:57:24.738 --> 01:57:26.672
will depend on the will of Heaven.

01:57:27.607 --> 01:57:28.665
The will of Heaven is bright and clear,

01:57:29.076 --> 01:57:29.703
but I'm travelling alone.

01:57:30.243 --> 01:57:32.635
Heaven and Earth have no space for me,

01:57:32.745 --> 01:57:33.610
but my heart is at peace.

01:57:38.585 --> 01:57:41.645
The sun is up. Let's go down.

01:58:04.611 --> 01:58:06.602
<i>In 690 A.D.,</i>

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.580
<i>Empress Wu became the first and only</i>

01:58:08.615 --> 01:58:10.480
<i>female emperor in the history of China.</i>

01:58:14.521 --> 01:58:18.582
<i>15 years later, in 705 A.D.,</i>

01:58:18.658 --> 01:58:19.716
<i>Empress Wu retired from the throne,</i>

01:58:20.593 --> 01:58:22.686
<i>returning the title to the Crown Prince,</i>

01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:28.490
<i>in honor of her promise to Detective Dee.</i>
