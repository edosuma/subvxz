BUT THE BREAD AND BUTTER
OF ANY DETECTIVE AGENCY

10:19.285 --> 10:22.246
WELL-TRAVELED?

10:22.330 --> 10:26.917
- I AM FROM ENGLAND, SO YES.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.714
- I DIDN'T GET THE PART,

10:31.797 --> 10:35.384
AND NOW I CAN'T GET
INTO THE VIP ROOM.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.722
HOW DO YOU STAND BEING ORDINARY,
MELANIE?

10:39.805 --> 10:41.515
- WELL, I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF
AS ORDINARY.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.892
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.977
I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW
THE WORLD PERCEIVES YOU.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.858
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY
THINKS I'M TOO OLD

10:50.941 --> 10:52.985
TO SEDUCE MARRIED MEN IN L.A.?

10:58.657 --> 10:59.575
I KNOW!

10:59.658 --> 11:02.495
I'M SPEECHLESS TOO.

11:04.997 --> 11:05.623
I SHOULD GO PROVE HIM WRONG.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.124
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.794
THAT IS THE THING ABOUT L.A.,
ISN'T IT?

11:09.877 --> 11:11.629
GREAT WEATHER,
SHOPPING, TREATMENTS.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.130
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

11:13.214 --> 11:15.049
ONLY THE GUYS
IN CLEVELAND FIND US HOT.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.260
- FROM THE GENTLEMAN
OVER THERE.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.096
- SCRAM!

11:22.681 --> 11:26.268
- SO THAT'S MY PITCH
FOR CLEVELAND.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.645
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
- GOOD PITCH.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.729
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.314
OH, UH, ELKA,

11:30.398 --> 11:34.735
YOU LEFT AN ENVELOPE OF CASH
HERE ON THE BAR.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.071
- I THINK THAT'S YOURS.

11:42.701 --> 11:46.497
- YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.013
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS UP THERE.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.230
- I SAW YOU ACROSS THE ROOM,
AND I SAW THAT SMILE.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.649
{\an1}AND I THOUGHT, "WOULDN'T IT BE
NICE IF THAT SMILE WERE FOR ME?"

12:13.732 --> 12:15.609
- WELL, THAT'S VERY SWEET.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.945
BUT UNLESS THINGS
HAVE CHANGED IN L.A.,

12:18.028 --> 12:20.364
GUYS YOUR AGE DON'T BUY DRINKS
FOR WOMEN LIKE ME.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.116
- MM, YOU DOING THAT THING
THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN DO

12:22.199 --> 12:25.286
WHERE THEY CLAIM THEY DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL?

12:27.246 --> 12:30.624
- YEAH, I GUESS I AM.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.834
- OH, CAN I GET YOU
ANOTHER DRINK?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.545
- I WOULD LOVE ONE, YEAH.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.797
NOW I'M GONNA DO THAT THING
THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN DO

12:36.881 --> 12:37.840
WHEN THEY
PUT ON THEIR READING GLASSES

12:37.923 --> 12:41.802
TO LOOK AT THE DRINK LIST.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.555
- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS L.A.,

12:44.638 --> 12:48.017
AND I MAY NOT BE THE YOUNG,
DUMB HONEY TRAP YOU'RE USED TO.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.227
BUT I DO KNOW
HOW TO GRAB A MAN'S ATTENTION.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.479
OBSERVE.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.397
- LADY, I'M REALLY--
- I SAID OBSERVE.

13:01.989 --> 13:06.535
OH, I'M SO THIRSTY.

13:08.787 --> 13:12.708
SO THIRSTY.

13:12.791 --> 13:17.254
WHAT DOES A GIRL HAVE TO DO
TO GET A DRINK AROUND HERE?

13:17.338 --> 13:18.631
- I DON'T KNOW.
ASK THE BARTENDER.

13:18.714 --> 13:23.219
- [laughs]

13:23.302 --> 13:25.304
OH, YOU.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.853
I'M SO THIRS--

13:32.937 --> 13:36.982
- NOT INTERESTED.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.692
- I AM SO GLAD
YOU CAME HERE TONIGHT.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.444
- ME TOO.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.363
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO KISS YOU.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.740
- WELL, THAT'S VERY FLATTERING,

13:44.823 --> 13:48.369
BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH YOUNGER
THAN I AM,

13:48.452 --> 13:50.913
THOUGH YOU HAVE RESTORED
MY FAITH IN L.A.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.873
- COME ON, JUST ONE KISS?
REAL QUICK?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.124
- REAL QUICK?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.126
- I'LL GIVE YOU $20.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.213
- WHAT?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.714
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'M ON A SCAVENGER HUNT

14:00.798 --> 14:02.716
FOR A BACHELOR PARTY,
AND I HAVE TILL 9:00

14:02.800 --> 14:06.929
TO GET A SELFIE
OF ME KISSING A HOG.

14:07.012 --> 14:07.930
- A HOG?

14:08.013 --> 14:10.099
- HOT OLDER GIRL.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.642
- OH.
- THAT'S YOU.

14:11.725 --> 14:15.312
- OH, SO YOU'VE JUST BEEN
SCAMMING ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.566
WELL, THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME
WHY I LEFT L.A.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.568
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET BACK
TO THE SCAVENGER HUNT.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.778
- MM.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.197
- HEY, YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
A GARTER BELT IN YOUR PURSE?

14:25.281 --> 14:28.701
- HOW ABOUT A LOUBOUTIN FOOT
IN YOUR ASS?

14:51.807 --> 14:53.309
- MS. CHASE?

14:53.392 --> 14:57.605
- UH, I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR MY CONTACT LENS.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.983
IT FELL UP.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.902
OH, FINE, JUST TAKE ME BACK
TO MY TABLE.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.040
- HOW'D IT GO WITH PELLEGRINO?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.791
- MM, TERRIBLE.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.336
I WAS TRYING TO SHOW OFF
MY HONEY TRAP SKILLS,

15:20.419 --> 15:22.713
BUT EVERYONE REJECTED ME.

15:22.796 --> 15:26.634
THEN HE LEAVES,
AND OUT OF THE BLUE,

15:26.717 --> 15:31.013
THIS HOT YOUNG GUY
COMES OVER AND KISSES ME.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.687
HE WAS SO PROUD OF IT,
HE WANTED TO TAKE A SELFIE.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
- DID HE?

15:48.489 --> 15:52.034
- YOUR ENTREE, SIR.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.703
- [spits]
THAT'S NOT SALMON MIST.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.832
- I KNOW.
IT'S MY PERFUME.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.584
- VICTORIA, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:00.668 --> 16:01.877
- I HAD TO TALK TO YOU.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.379
NOW, I AM RIGHT FOR THIS PART,

16:03.462 --> 16:04.505
AND I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.714
- HOW?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.008
- WELL,
I HADN'T THOUGHT THAT FAR.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.553
I SPENT ALL MY ENERGY SHOVING
THAT WAITRESS INTO THE CLOSET.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.514
I JUST KNOW I CAN DO IT.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.891
- NO, YOU'RE STILL WRONG FOR IT.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.017
- OH, BUT WHY?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.562
- WHEN I SAW YOU IN THAT BRIGHT,
UNFORGIVING BEACH SUN,

16:20.646 --> 16:22.648
I REALIZED
THAT YOU HAD NO CHEMISTRY

16:22.731 --> 16:26.110
WITH YOUR YOUNG,
VIBRANT COSTAR, MALIBU.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.861
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

16:27.945 --> 16:31.240
- DON'T MAKE ME TELL MY AGENT
TO TELL YOUR AGENT

16:31.323 --> 16:34.410
WHAT I'M SAYING.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.454
- DO YOU MEAN THAT I AM NOT
HOT ENOUGH FOR MALIBU?

16:37.538 --> 16:39.748
- YOUR WORDS, MY FEELINGS.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.881
- SHE MAY NOT BE HOT ENOUGH
FOR L.A.,

16:47.965 --> 16:51.802
BUT SHE'S HOT ENOUGH
FOR CLEVELAND.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.430
- ELKA, HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.724
- I'M 92.
I DO WHAT I WANT.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.520
- CLEVELAND?
THE SHOW'S SET IN MALIBU.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.106
- OH, FINE.
STAY IN YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.108
THAT'S THE SAFE THING TO DO.

17:06.191 --> 17:10.112
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
EGG CHAIR WOMAN?

17:10.194 --> 17:12.573
ZED SIMMS
HAS NO COMFORT ZONE.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.574
- PROVE IT.

17:13.656 --> 17:18.244
SHOOT YOUR SHOW
IN A REAL CITY.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.664
- CLEVELAND.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.126
WAIT, I'M SEEING IT.
YES, AH.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.172
THE CAMERA
RISES OUT OF THE GREAT LAKE...

17:28.255 --> 17:30.591
ERIE?

17:30.674 --> 17:33.469
- SURE.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.804
- IN MALIBU,
YOU'RE NOT GLAMOROUS.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.431
LIFE HAS SLAPPED YOU AROUND,

17:37.514 --> 17:39.641
AND YOU HAVE
A LOT OF BAD ANGLES.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.812
BUT IN A PLACE THAT'S GRITTY
AND DARK AND DAMP,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.482
OH, MY GOD.

17:46.565 --> 17:50.986
IN CLEVELAND,
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.196
- SO I GOT THE PART?

17:52.279 --> 17:54.323
- YES, YES.
I HAVE TO GO.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.158
I HAVE TO TOTALLY REWRITE
THE ROLE.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.493
- OH, WONDERFUL.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.827
I ALREADY HAVE NOTES.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.997
- WHICH I'M ALREADY IGNORING.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.207
- WE DID IT, VICTORIA.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.335
- WE DID, DIDN'T WE?

18:06.418 --> 18:07.836
OH, CRAP.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.214
I'M GOING BACK TO CLEVELAND.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.632
- CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE?

18:11.715 --> 18:12.883
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:12.966 --> 18:15.677
I AM THE STAR
OF A NEW HBO SERIES

18:15.761 --> 18:20.015
IN THE VIP ROOM OF
THE HOTTEST RESTAURANT IN L.A.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.809
OH, AND LOOK.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.852
OH, THEY HAVE A LITTLE WINDOW
IN THE FLOOR

18:23.936 --> 18:27.397
WHERE YOU CAN LOOK DOWN
ON THE NOBODIES.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.900
AND THERE'S JOY AND MELANIE.

18:29.983 --> 18:33.779
OH, NOTHING COULD GET ME
OUT OF THIS PLACE.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.115
[rumbling]

18:37.616 --> 18:38.742
- EARTHQUAKE!

18:41.078 --> 18:46.250

18:46.333 --> 18:47.543
- WE NEED
TO EVACUATE THE PREMISES.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.878
HOT WOMEN
AND CHILD STARS FIRST.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.674
- OH, I HATE L.A.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.176
LET'S GO HOME.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.394
- A ROUND OF ELKA OSTROVSKIES
FOR YOU LADIES.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.646
- HEY, I THOUGHT
THOSE WERE VICTORIA CHASES.

19:07.729 --> 19:11.066
- THEY WERE, BUT WE RENAMED THEM
IN HONOR OF THE COUNCILWOMAN.

19:11.149 --> 19:13.235
THANKS FOR BRINGING JOBS
TO CLEVELAND.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.570
- I HAD TO.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.198
I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.951
- THEY'RE FROM THOSE GUYS
OVER THERE.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.953
- WELL, NOW THAT IS
MORE LIKE IT.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.872
STRONG DRINKS
FROM GOOD-LOOKING MEN.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.290
[chuckles]
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.916
- OH, IT IS.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.752
IT'S SO COMFORTING TO KNOW
THAT, IF HIRED TO,

19:30.836 --> 19:34.506
I COULD RUIN ANY MARRIAGE
IN HERE.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.383
- L.A. MAKES ME SHALLOW.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.676
WHEN I WAS THERE,

19:37.759 --> 19:39.386
I WAS JEALOUS
OF EVERYONE ELSE'S SUCCESS.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.097
BUT HERE,
EVERYONE'S JEALOUS OF ME.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.807
- YOU KNOW WHAT L.A. IS?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.184
L.A. IS
THE SEXY BAD BOYFRIEND.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.561
YOU KEEP GOING BACK TO HIM,
THINKING HE'S GONNA CHANGE,

19:47.644 --> 19:48.979
BUT HE'S NEVER GOING TO.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.940
CLEVELAND,
HE'S OUR LOVING HUSBAND.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.775
- YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY BEEN
WITH CLEVELAND

19:53.859 --> 19:57.446
LONGER THAN ANY HUSBAND
I'VE EVER HAD.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.780
HE MAY NOT BE GLAMOROUS,

19:58.864 --> 20:00.782
BUT HE'S ALWAYS THERE
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.286
- AND LIKE A GOOD HUSBAND,
CLEVELAND ALWAYS THINKS

20:04.369 --> 20:06.622
WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER
THAN WE ARE.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.832
- BUZZ OFF, LADIES.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.959
