WEBVTT

00:11.376 --> 00:12.987
When you sign a medical directive

00:13.011 --> 00:14.592
or a consent to surgery,

00:14.616 --> 00:16.390
there's an important question we ask.

00:16.414 --> 00:17.668
Ready?

00:19.830 --> 00:21.261
No.

00:21.285 --> 00:24.264
"In the event of a possibly
fatal complication..."

00:24.288 --> 00:25.466
Thanks for coming...

00:32.930 --> 00:34.975
"...do you want us to use
extraordinary measures

00:34.999 --> 00:37.211
to prolong your life?

00:37.235 --> 00:40.214
If your heart stops,
do you want us to begin CPR?"

00:43.574 --> 00:45.753
Hey. You just get back in town?

00:45.777 --> 00:48.055
Yeah. I landed last night.

00:48.079 --> 00:49.817
Um, listen.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.320
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.155
I didn't think it was a good idea for you

00:54.179 --> 00:57.725
or your... your mom to come
to Sabrina's service.

00:57.749 --> 00:59.294
Mom didn't go?

00:59.318 --> 01:01.463
Ah, the family's not ready to see anyone,

01:01.487 --> 01:02.897
especially from Seattle.

01:02.921 --> 01:04.465
- "Do you want to be violently shocked...
- Okay.

01:04.489 --> 01:06.897
...with 360 joules of electricity?"

01:06.922 --> 01:08.433
So, the book says we can't
start sleep-training

01:08.457 --> 01:09.534
until after six months.

01:09.558 --> 01:11.002
One book. One book says that.

01:11.026 --> 01:12.637
Other books say that you
can start at four months

01:12.661 --> 01:14.205
or when they start dropping night feeds.

01:14.229 --> 01:15.907
Or when the mom starts losing her mind

01:15.931 --> 01:18.443
because of cumulative sleep deprivation.

01:18.467 --> 01:21.045
- Everything okay?
- Allison had us up till 3:00.

01:21.069 --> 01:23.281
Us? You slept through the whole
thing. Or you pretended to.

01:23.305 --> 01:25.717
Hey, hey! Is that coffee?

01:25.741 --> 01:27.352
M-Maybe you should just take it.

01:27.376 --> 01:28.486
Thank you so much.

01:29.778 --> 01:32.323
I don't remember all you people

01:32.347 --> 01:34.025
putting in requests for the day off.

01:34.049 --> 01:36.361
And whose fault is it they need to?

01:36.713 --> 01:37.790
Richard.

01:37.814 --> 01:39.725
- Nice to see you.
- Bailey.

01:39.749 --> 01:41.460
"Do you agree to multiple injections

01:41.484 --> 01:45.297
of adrenaline into your veins
or a tube down your throat?"

01:49.592 --> 01:51.870
How far will you go to stay alive?

01:55.907 --> 01:58.219
No one's suspending
Meredith Grey's license.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.855
She won a Catherine Fox award.
She's a legend.

02:00.879 --> 02:02.990
Well, I heard she operated
on a fellow resident.

02:03.014 --> 02:04.525
She took out a healthy appendix.

02:04.549 --> 02:06.994
No, she and Cristina Yang
rescued an intern

02:07.018 --> 02:09.163
who removed another
intern's appendix, incorrectly.

02:09.187 --> 02:10.231
They were helping.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.432
That wasn't the other Dr. Grey,

02:11.456 --> 02:12.800
the one that died in the plane crash?

02:12.824 --> 02:14.969
Our Dr. Grey cut a patient's LVAD wire.

02:15.326 --> 02:17.704
See, you consider these things legendary.

02:17.728 --> 02:19.473
They're also crimes.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.776
I'm a witness at the hearing.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.778
- And I forgot a tie.
- Sounds about right.

02:24.802 --> 02:26.747
My lucky tie was in my locker. Come here.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.383
Okay, if anyone should speak
on behalf of Dr. Grey,

02:29.407 --> 02:30.550
it really should be me.

02:30.574 --> 02:32.678
Everybody shut up.

02:34.004 --> 02:37.183
Most of the attendings will be
out for the hearing today,

02:37.207 --> 02:38.417
myself included,

02:38.441 --> 02:40.319
which means you guys have to cover.

02:40.343 --> 02:41.921
If you get into trouble, call me,

02:41.945 --> 02:43.222
but if it's not a disaster,

02:43.246 --> 02:46.547
I will bury you in scut for a month.

02:47.717 --> 02:48.794
Don't kill anyone.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074

03:06.830 --> 03:08.608
We'll be right back there,
Meredith, okay?

03:08.632 --> 03:10.443
- Okay.
- All right.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.834
If I was on your operating table,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.971
you'd want me to follow
your instructions, right?

03:14.995 --> 03:16.272
Lie there. Breathe in.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.907
Fall asleep. Let you do your job.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.943
That would be my best shot
at survival, right?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.277
I see where you're going with this.

03:21.301 --> 03:24.514
I'm begging you, Meredith.
Sit down, don't talk.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.683
And let me do my job. Please.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.784
I'm not a baby.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.085
No. You're an adult

03:29.109 --> 03:30.520
who's completely unable to be quiet

03:30.544 --> 03:32.422
no matter how much
your well-being depends on it.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.758
And today, it could cost you
your entire future.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.087
The prosecuting attorney
is Ashley Cordova.

03:38.111 --> 03:39.922
Getting questioned by her is like someone

03:39.946 --> 03:42.758
ripping hangnails
off all 10 fingers at once.

03:42.782 --> 03:45.160
Sitting quietly and remaining respectful

03:45.184 --> 03:47.663
will go against every fiber
of your being.

03:47.687 --> 03:48.897
But please.

03:48.921 --> 03:50.265
Just for today.

03:50.289 --> 03:52.267
Just for the next few hours.

03:52.291 --> 03:54.403
Sit still and shut up.

03:54.427 --> 03:55.771
Okay.

03:55.795 --> 03:57.473
Thank you. Okay. Let's do this.

03:57.497 --> 03:59.675
Good morning.

03:59.699 --> 04:02.378
Based on the number of witnesses
on the list I just read,

04:02.402 --> 04:05.887
this one's gonna be a circus,
so let's go ahead on record.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.156
My name is William Benson,

04:07.180 --> 04:09.358
I am the judge who's been
assigned to this case.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.427
We have Ms. Ashley Cordova,

04:11.451 --> 04:13.429
who's representing
the Medical Commission,

04:13.453 --> 04:16.665
and Ms. Nancy Klein, who will
represent the respondent.

04:16.689 --> 04:19.334
The commission panel
includes Dr. Aaron Rosenberg,

04:19.358 --> 04:21.702
Dr. Maria Lang, and...

04:21.726 --> 04:24.206
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here. Sorry. Traffic.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.908
Light was out on Broadway.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.459
Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Lang,

04:28.484 --> 04:31.697
and panel chair Dr. Paul Castello.

04:31.721 --> 04:34.766
Mrs. Shepherd, there's some
things you need to know. Ma'am.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.135
Give me the papers!

04:37.693 --> 04:39.838
How do we switch out one
of the doctors on the panel?

04:39.862 --> 04:41.673
We don't. Why?

04:41.697 --> 04:43.842
Because that one killed my husband.

04:53.075 --> 05:01.049
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:01.296 --> 05:03.008
We will follow these protocols

05:03.032 --> 05:04.075
throughout these proceedings.

05:04.099 --> 05:06.089
Paul Castello was the trauma surgeon

05:06.113 --> 05:08.926
who operated on my husband at Dillard.

05:08.951 --> 05:13.032
He did not get a head CT.

05:13.056 --> 05:14.700
Okay. Does he remember you?

05:14.724 --> 05:16.969
It doesn't seem like it.

05:16.993 --> 05:18.570
Which is enraging.

05:18.594 --> 05:20.539
Can we appeal or something?

05:20.563 --> 05:22.508
Yes, but it could be six months

05:22.532 --> 05:24.209
before you're rescheduled.

05:24.975 --> 05:27.246
Ohh.

05:27.270 --> 05:30.115
Okay. No, he's taken enough.

05:30.139 --> 05:31.784
He doesn't get another six months.

05:31.808 --> 05:35.187
Let's... We stay.

05:35.211 --> 05:38.991
We are here today in the matter
of Dr. Meredith Grey,

05:39.015 --> 05:40.359
who is charged with allegations

05:40.383 --> 05:42.761
that she practiced
below the acceptable standards

05:42.785 --> 05:44.296
of medical practice in a manner

05:44.320 --> 05:47.099
that exploited patients
and insurance carriers.

05:47.123 --> 05:48.967
In fact, Dr. Grey is...

05:48.991 --> 05:52.404
Dr. Bailey, you've known
Dr. Grey a long time.

05:52.428 --> 05:53.939
Could you speak about that at all?

05:53.963 --> 05:56.275
I met her when she was an intern.

05:56.299 --> 05:58.177
Would you say the two of you
have grown close

05:58.201 --> 06:00.179
- over all this time?
- No.

06:00.203 --> 06:02.381
Didn't Dr. Grey name her son after you?

06:02.405 --> 06:05.117
If you're asking if
her son's name is Bailey,

06:05.141 --> 06:06.975
then, yes, it is.

06:08.211 --> 06:11.323
Dr. Grey is a well-respected
general surgeon.

06:11.347 --> 06:12.491
You've agreed to that.

06:12.515 --> 06:13.659
Is that a question?

06:13.683 --> 06:16.395
Well, when you became chief of surgery,

06:16.419 --> 06:19.698
you asked Dr. Grey to become
your chief of general surgery.

06:19.722 --> 06:21.333
And from my estimation,

06:21.357 --> 06:25.304
a chief of general surgery
is extremely skilled,

06:25.328 --> 06:27.973
organized, dedicated, communicative.

06:27.997 --> 06:30.207
Does that sound correct to you?

06:30.900 --> 06:35.503
It does. And she is no longer
my chief of general surgery.

06:38.007 --> 06:39.852
No more questions. Thank you.

06:39.876 --> 06:42.121
Ms. Cordova? Any cross?

06:42.145 --> 06:44.022
Uh, actually, yes.

06:46.716 --> 06:50.696
Dr. Grey has developed
quite the disciplinary record

06:50.720 --> 06:53.499
over all those years
you've known her, hasn't she?

06:53.523 --> 06:55.000
Your name is listed as the doctor

06:55.024 --> 06:57.402
who reported the following incidents...

06:57.426 --> 06:59.605
interns, including Dr. Grey,

06:59.629 --> 07:02.380
admitting to cutting
a patient's LVAD wire.

07:02.405 --> 07:03.682
I do not want to have to testify

07:03.706 --> 07:04.917
against any of you in a court of law.

07:04.941 --> 07:06.952
Dr. Grey performed a surgery

07:06.976 --> 07:09.922
on an intern without an attending.

07:09.946 --> 07:12.458
Dr. Grey instructed a younger resident

07:12.482 --> 07:14.560
to remove a brain tumor without consent

07:14.584 --> 07:16.495
from the patient or attending.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.931
Dr. Grey would not allow
an education consultant

07:18.955 --> 07:20.232
to enter her O.R.,

07:20.256 --> 07:21.633
- so you suspended her.
- You're suspended.

07:21.657 --> 07:25.204
All of these things familiar
to you, Dr. Bailey?

07:25.228 --> 07:26.839
All true.

07:29.499 --> 07:32.744
My daughter, Gabby...
she had terrible stomach pain,

07:33.152 --> 07:36.098
and my neighbor told me about
the free clinic at the hospital.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.733
So you took Gabby there,

07:37.757 --> 07:40.002
where you were seen by Dr. Grey?

07:40.026 --> 07:44.340
Yes. She said that Gabby
had a mass in her intestine.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.708
Mm-hmm. And she needed surgery.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.343
But you didn't have health insurance.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.912
For you or your daughter.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.548
No, I didn't have insurance.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.216
I see.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.485
You must have been terrified
during all of this.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.887
Were you by yourself?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.688
Yes. Dani, my wife,

07:59.712 --> 08:03.325
she was in a detention center
at the time, at the border.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.494
This is before they sent her
back to Honduras.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.264
I am so sorry to hear that.
And how's Gabby?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.266
They said that she was
responding very well

08:10.290 --> 08:11.667
to the medication.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.235
Because we caught it early.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.338
Because Dr. Grey did. She saved us.

08:16.362 --> 08:18.318
The world needs more people like her.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.484
More doctors like her.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.315
And were you aware Dr. Grey
had committed insurance fraud?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.984
No. I found out when Dr. Webber

08:29.008 --> 08:31.453
approached Dr. Grey in the scrub room.

08:31.477 --> 08:33.956
He saw her daughter's name
on the schedule and was worried.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.323
Ms. Cordova, can I jump in here?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.326
- By all means.
- Can he do that?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.695
The panel can do whatever they want.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.130
Dr. DeLuca, your relationship

08:41.154 --> 08:42.831
with Dr. Grey at the time.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.333
She was an attending, and you were...?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.035
I was a fourth-year surgical resident.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.870
I'm now a fifth year.

08:47.894 --> 08:51.140
And you're in a romantic
relationship with your boss.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.850
There's documentation
from Human Resources.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.644
I'm sorry. How is this relevant?

08:55.668 --> 08:57.146
You didn't alert a supervisor

08:57.170 --> 08:58.914
when you found out
what Dr. Grey had done,

08:58.938 --> 09:01.550
so, yes, I'd consider it relevant.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.874
Well, unless... Is it consensual?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.523
It is.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.391
Thank you, Dr. DeLuca.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.560
Not quite yet. I'd like to ask about

09:11.584 --> 09:14.096
when you applied for a transfer
from Grey Sloan.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.365
Sure. It, uh... It was nothing.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.834
I was having a bad time in
my intern year, and, uh...

09:18.858 --> 09:20.436
- I figured it out, changed my mind.
- Mm-hmm.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.104
And by "bad time," you're referring

09:22.128 --> 09:24.974
to your mistreatment
by specific attendings

09:24.998 --> 09:28.877
after a violent incident
with Dr. Alex Karev?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.913
I dropped the charges against Dr. Karev.

09:30.937 --> 09:34.683
Oh, I know. I'd like
to present Exhibit B-5.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.887
This is from Dr. DeLuca's personnel file.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.589
Dr. DeLuca, could you do me a favor

09:40.613 --> 09:43.014
and read the highlighted section?

09:44.517 --> 09:46.762
Alex! "Since I charged Dr. Karev

09:46.786 --> 09:48.864
with a felony,
I feel his fellow attendings

09:48.888 --> 09:50.466
want to keep me off their services

09:50.490 --> 09:51.700
and out of the O.R.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.769
Because of this,
I feel my residency experience

09:53.793 --> 09:54.937
will be compromised."

09:54.961 --> 09:56.572
And a little further down, you named

09:56.596 --> 09:59.274
one of these attendings.
What's the highlighted name?

10:01.534 --> 10:03.000
Dr. Meredith Grey.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.715
But I-I changed my mind.
It was a long time ago.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.118
Ancient history. We've worked it out.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.787
Yes. Dr. Grey seems
to have made sure of that.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.056
No further questions.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.060
It's okay.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.535
Dr. Schmitt.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.805
Dr. Schmitt.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.330
Dr. Schmitt.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.179
I'm sorry. I, uh...

10:37.203 --> 10:39.214
I've never been in a courtroom before.

10:39.238 --> 10:42.125
You still haven't. We're in a hotel.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.187
Right. Um...

10:45.211 --> 10:46.755
What was the question?

10:46.779 --> 10:49.792
Dr. Grey is one
of your teachers, correct?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.293
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.818
And she's the best teacher I've ever had.

10:53.843 --> 10:56.255
Dr. Grey always gave me an opportunity.

10:56.279 --> 10:58.190
And she didn't jump in
with the mean nicknames

10:58.214 --> 10:59.851
like everybody else.

11:00.516 --> 11:01.960
And when the hospital got hacked,

11:01.984 --> 11:03.362
it locked the blood bank,

11:03.386 --> 11:06.965
so Dr. Grey had me
become a human blood bank.

11:06.989 --> 11:08.441
For the patient.

11:09.158 --> 11:10.602
It was incredible.

11:10.626 --> 11:14.840
I did pass out in the O.R.,
but I saved the patient.

11:14.864 --> 11:17.509
Wow. That is... very helpful.

11:17.533 --> 11:21.079
I was more interested in your
involvement with Gabby Rivera.

11:21.103 --> 11:22.848
Right.

11:22.872 --> 11:27.245
I rounded on her once
during a peds rotation,

11:27.270 --> 11:28.714
but I was barely there.

11:28.738 --> 11:30.382
Well, you were there
long enough to see a name

11:30.406 --> 11:32.133
on Gabby's I.D. bracelet.

11:33.743 --> 11:35.587
Um...

11:35.611 --> 11:38.557
Dr. Schmitt. I'd like to
remind you you're under oath.

11:38.581 --> 11:41.026
And I don't recommend perjuring yourself.

11:45.354 --> 11:48.200
I had heard Mr. Rivera
call his daughter "Gabby,"

11:48.224 --> 11:50.002
but the bracelet said Ellis Grey,

11:50.026 --> 11:54.113
so I thought that the hospital
had made an error.

11:54.664 --> 11:58.493
I wanted to take it
to Dr. Grey and ask, but...

11:59.168 --> 12:00.812
she wasn't there that day.

12:00.836 --> 12:02.547
So what did you do?

12:05.374 --> 12:07.853
Dr. Schmitt. What did you do?

12:17.420 --> 12:19.431
I brought it to Dr. Bailey.

12:19.455 --> 12:21.099
I thought it was a mistake.

12:21.123 --> 12:22.834
And I c... I couldn't make
any more mistakes.

12:22.858 --> 12:25.512
- No further questions.
- I...

12:25.536 --> 12:27.572
I'm sorry, Dr. Grey.

12:27.596 --> 12:30.731
I-I-I thought that I was doing
the right thing. I'm sorry.

12:40.317 --> 12:42.350
God. What happened?

12:44.188 --> 12:46.132
15-minute recess.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.868
Luis was great, uh, Bailey was a robot,

12:48.892 --> 12:50.768
they know that DeLuca
and Mer are a thing,

12:50.822 --> 12:52.033
so they're probably gonna ignore him,

12:52.057 --> 12:53.234
and Schmitt turned her in.

12:53.258 --> 12:55.836
Schmitt? Damn.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.271
They've gone through everyone's files.

12:57.295 --> 12:59.807
It's a crap-pile of crap.

12:59.831 --> 13:02.682
- How's Meredith?
- She needed some air.

13:09.574 --> 13:13.475
Today may be my actual
last day of being a doctor.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.214
Meredith, it's not over.

13:17.238 --> 13:18.990
We won't make it.

13:19.574 --> 13:21.318
If I lose my license...

13:21.342 --> 13:23.487
and I can't cut, but you can...

13:23.511 --> 13:25.345
we won't make it.

13:41.706 --> 13:44.418
Dr. Hunt, as an Army surgeon,

13:44.442 --> 13:47.269
you've trained and worked with
doctors all over the world.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.705
I have to know,
is Dr. Grey really as good

13:49.729 --> 13:51.956
- as people say she is?
- No.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.843
She's better.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.978
The Catherine Fox award that she won

13:56.002 --> 13:59.248
was for a surgery
that saved my sister's life.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.417
Now, if Megan could have
been here today, she'd be...

14:01.441 --> 14:02.718
She'd be showing you

14:02.742 --> 14:05.195
her transplanted abdomen herself.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.198
- So you've come around.
- I'm sorry? Wh...

14:07.222 --> 14:08.700
Exhibit C-2.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.401
These are Dr. Bailey's surgical notes

14:10.425 --> 14:13.304
after Dr. Grey botched
your sister's first surgery.

14:13.328 --> 14:15.173
"Hunt has concerns that Dr. Grey

14:15.197 --> 14:18.443
could not close patient's
abdomen the first time.

14:18.467 --> 14:21.312
If she fails again,
patient has no other options."

14:21.336 --> 14:24.482
The "Hunt" in this note is you, correct?

14:26.704 --> 14:29.149
Dr. Webber, would it be safe to say

14:29.173 --> 14:30.851
that you've seen Dr. Grey partake

14:30.875 --> 14:33.087
in a lot of groundbreaking work?

14:33.111 --> 14:34.521
Absolutely. Most recently,

14:34.545 --> 14:37.491
she was published for her
studies with mini-livers in mice.

14:37.515 --> 14:40.678
And going back, I read about a
trial for Alzheimer's disease

14:40.703 --> 14:42.281
carried out under your tenure as chief.

14:42.305 --> 14:44.216
I'm curious why it didn't continue.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.651
Well, that trial ended at Grey Sloan

14:45.675 --> 14:47.085
because someone tampered with it.

14:47.109 --> 14:48.387
Could you elaborate on that?

14:48.411 --> 14:51.356
Is that necessary for this investigation?

14:51.380 --> 14:53.847
Answer the question, Dr. Webber.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.505
My wife...

14:58.888 --> 15:02.635
My late wife was a participant.

15:04.605 --> 15:07.117
And I discovered that she was selected

15:07.141 --> 15:09.419
for the placebo

15:09.443 --> 15:12.378
instead of the experimental drug.

15:14.315 --> 15:18.195
I changed the envelopes.
I got her the drug.

15:18.219 --> 15:21.298
And you were the only one involved?

15:27.522 --> 15:29.801
- That's right.
- Thanks for clearing that up.

15:29.825 --> 15:32.737
I know there have been
instances when you...

15:32.761 --> 15:35.440
how should we put it... bent
the rules in favor of Dr. Grey.

15:35.464 --> 15:37.375
Objection. That's pure conjecture.

15:37.399 --> 15:39.243
Is it?

15:40.569 --> 15:43.948
- State your name, please.
- Patricia Murphy.

15:43.972 --> 15:45.416
Hi, guys!

15:45.722 --> 15:47.500
You used to work for Dr. Webber?

15:47.524 --> 15:48.635
Sure did.

15:48.659 --> 15:51.170
I was Chief Webber's
administrative assistant.

15:51.194 --> 15:52.839
I also was the point of contact

15:52.863 --> 15:55.675
for the National Residency
Matching Program.

15:55.699 --> 15:57.966
First person to see who had matched.

15:59.870 --> 16:02.615
Please see exhibit D-1,

16:02.639 --> 16:05.885
the list of interns who matched
Dr. Grey's first year.

16:05.909 --> 16:10.523
Ms. Murphy, could you find
Dr. Grey's name on that list?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.881
Oh, her name isn't on here.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.583
Why not? Didn't Meredith Grey match

16:14.607 --> 16:16.118
at Seattle Grace that year?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.220
No. Uh, not at first, anyway.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.155
Dr. Webber asked me to set up a call

16:20.179 --> 16:22.257
with the President of the NRMP.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.459
And next thing I knew,

16:23.483 --> 16:26.095
I was adding Grey's name to the roster.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.530
I'm sorry. That sounds like
you're saying Meredith Grey

16:28.554 --> 16:30.733
was never supposed to
work at that hospital

16:30.757 --> 16:32.735
in the first place.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.718
Dr. Grey and I worked
together through internship,

16:40.742 --> 16:44.121
boards, specializing, everything.

16:44.145 --> 16:45.856
We all started out
competing with each other,

16:45.880 --> 16:49.126
but I stopped competing with her
a long time ago.

16:49.163 --> 16:50.396
Did you just call me a nurse?

16:50.420 --> 16:54.226
She makes me better. A better,
uh, surgeon, better person.

16:54.260 --> 16:56.605
The Medical Commission's
trying to establish a pattern

16:56.629 --> 16:59.508
that Dr. Grey is rash, reckless.

16:59.532 --> 17:01.750
Would you agree with that?
Absolutely not.

17:01.774 --> 17:03.378
She has her reasons
for how she treats patients,

17:03.402 --> 17:04.980
and I always agree with it.

17:05.003 --> 17:07.115
Dr. Grey's oldest daughter

17:07.138 --> 17:09.718
is one of your patients, correct?

17:10.079 --> 17:11.690
You've treated her through the years,

17:11.714 --> 17:15.060
which means you most likely had
to sign off on the adoption.

17:15.084 --> 17:17.251
Why was it held up? Do you know?

17:18.921 --> 17:20.832
What did I do?

17:20.856 --> 17:23.234
U-Unfortunately, those things
always have delays.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.604
I, uh... I mean, I see it all the time.

17:25.627 --> 17:29.363
It wasn't because Dr. Grey was
briefly fired from Grey Sloan?

17:32.435 --> 17:35.147
Did Dr. Grey's insubordinate behavior

17:35.171 --> 17:39.084
almost cost her her daughter's
adoption, Dr. Karev?

17:39.108 --> 17:40.352
I'm sorry. I don't...

17:40.376 --> 17:42.569
I don't see how her family
life is relevant here.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.506
Well, she seems to be
fairly cavalier about the law

17:44.530 --> 17:46.141
in both her professional
and personal life,

17:46.165 --> 17:48.076
so I'd say it's relevant.
In fact, she used her

17:48.100 --> 17:50.345
youngest daughter's identity to
commit insurance fraud, so...

17:50.369 --> 17:52.747
Alan Brown, Farrah Alazari,

17:52.771 --> 17:54.883
Deborah Greene, and Sam Carter.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.408
Dr. Grey, we have your list of
your patient testimonies here.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.743
You don't need to repeat them.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.245
Those are the names of the spouses

18:00.269 --> 18:01.646
of every patient I've ever lost.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.548
I remember every single one of them.

18:03.572 --> 18:04.950
Okay. Uh, thank you for that.

18:04.974 --> 18:06.384
You don't get to sit up there

18:06.408 --> 18:08.019
and ask questions about my daughter.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.488
If you want to take my license

18:09.512 --> 18:11.223
and make sure I never see
another patient again,

18:11.247 --> 18:14.192
then you do that,
but you have absolutely no right

18:14.216 --> 18:16.061
to ever mention my daughter's name

18:16.085 --> 18:19.231
because you are the one
who killed her father.

18:19.255 --> 18:20.918
You don't remember me.

18:20.942 --> 18:22.138
Meredith.

18:22.162 --> 18:23.669
But I remember you.

18:24.627 --> 18:27.839
As the coward who stood
over my dying husband...

18:27.863 --> 18:28.874
You're gonna be fine.

18:28.898 --> 18:29.975
...the love of my life,

18:29.999 --> 18:32.511
and you didn't even attempt
to do burr holes

18:32.535 --> 18:34.913
after he failed to get him a head CT.

18:34.937 --> 18:36.281
Burr holes!

18:36.305 --> 18:38.984
We don't have time for a CT!

18:39.008 --> 18:40.886
I was doing burr holes as an intern.

18:40.910 --> 18:44.189
That one night should have
cost you your entire career,

18:44.213 --> 18:46.992
but instead you're sitting
up here judging me?

18:47.016 --> 18:49.487
You don't deserve to judge anyone.

18:50.653 --> 18:53.398
Your Honor, if we could, um,
just take a short recess

18:53.422 --> 18:55.600
to evaluate the situation,

18:55.624 --> 18:59.170
see if Dr. Grey's, um, conflict
of interest is, um...

18:59.194 --> 19:01.373
My conflict of interest?!

19:01.397 --> 19:03.642
My medical license should not be
in this man's hands.

19:03.666 --> 19:05.110
- Okay, come on.
- He is dangerous.

19:05.134 --> 19:06.411
Okay, come on, let's go.

19:07.770 --> 19:09.481
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

19:19.001 --> 19:20.287
Put the jacket under his head.

19:20.311 --> 19:21.682
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.
- Okay. Do we know

19:21.706 --> 19:23.082
if he has a history of epilepsy?

19:23.106 --> 19:24.750
I'm gonna check for medical
bracelets and I.D. here.

19:24.774 --> 19:26.285
Hey, the paramedics
are here with the gurney.

19:26.309 --> 19:28.320
- What do we got?
- We got a male in his mid-40s.

19:28.345 --> 19:29.722
Started seizing about four minutes ago.

19:29.746 --> 19:32.024
We're maintaining his airway.
And take him to Grey Sloan.

19:32.048 --> 19:34.026
He should have
the very best care there is.

19:34.050 --> 19:36.128
- Meredith.
- Can you do that?

19:36.152 --> 19:38.431
Get him on his side.

19:38.455 --> 19:40.099
And get him a damn head CT!

19:48.631 --> 19:49.942
Hey, hey. Ma'am.

19:49.966 --> 19:51.777
Head of trauma.

19:51.801 --> 19:53.779
I wouldn't "ma'am" her.

19:54.223 --> 19:55.768
Seizure stopped two minutes ago

19:55.792 --> 19:57.936
after multiple doses of Diazepam.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.106
His last BP was 220/128,
and he's tachy to 145.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.742
He needs clevidipine and a head CT ASAP.

20:03.766 --> 20:05.144
I called ahead. Let's get him upstairs.

20:05.168 --> 20:07.412
- Let's go, go, go!
- You guys left the hearing?

20:07.436 --> 20:09.114
We weren't gonna put this all on you.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.200
But it... in just
a couple of weeks, it had...

20:25.224 --> 20:27.569
it had... had grown so much
in size, that it was...

20:27.593 --> 20:30.939
it was squeezing up
into the pulmonary artery.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.742
Like, the... Do you know
what that is, Jake?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.689
Brett. And no.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.315
Well, it's, um...

20:40.339 --> 20:43.252
It makes sure that blood
gets to the lungs, which...

20:43.276 --> 20:45.087
You know, important.

20:45.616 --> 20:47.627
But, um, her blood had...

20:47.651 --> 20:51.464
had clotted all the way from here to...

20:51.488 --> 20:53.566
Do you have a red pen?

20:53.590 --> 20:55.935
No. And I kinda need that one back.

21:00.397 --> 21:01.841
And another one of these, please.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.797
Did you come to gloat?

21:13.390 --> 21:15.735
Just checking on you.

21:15.759 --> 21:17.304
It's 2:00 in the afternoon,

21:17.328 --> 21:20.140
and you appear to be well past
the legal limit.

21:20.164 --> 21:22.442
So gloating.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.419
What are you doing here? Are
they on a break or something?

21:26.443 --> 21:29.856
No. It may be canceled.
One of the doctors on the panel

21:29.880 --> 21:31.791
apparently is the one that killed Derek,

21:31.815 --> 21:34.661
so Mer went off on him, and he collapsed.

21:34.685 --> 21:37.613
Possible seizure disorder.
We're not sure yet.

21:38.522 --> 21:41.635
Maybe he forgot to check
the activated clotting time.

21:44.995 --> 21:47.123
You know what happened, right?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.843
My mom told me about it, yeah.

21:52.002 --> 21:54.713
Richard's never gonna speak to me again.

21:55.706 --> 21:57.651
I don't blame him.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.014
Why don't we just leave this here

22:03.038 --> 22:04.783
and I'll get you home?

22:05.130 --> 22:06.374
But I need it.

22:06.398 --> 22:09.210
Maggie, I'm sure you have
some wine at home, too, okay?

22:09.234 --> 22:10.688
Come on.

22:35.660 --> 22:39.695
You lied to those people.
You flat-out lied.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.146
And you answered those questions

22:43.170 --> 22:44.681
like you barely know Meredith.

22:44.705 --> 22:45.915
No. I do know Meredith.

22:45.939 --> 22:48.551
I know she will put everything at risk

22:48.575 --> 22:50.093
to suit her needs.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.529
Meredith is anything but selfish.

22:52.553 --> 22:54.898
Oh, no? She hasn't asked you
to sideline your career

22:54.922 --> 22:56.100
to save her ass?

22:56.124 --> 22:57.868
No, she has not asked me to do that.

22:57.892 --> 23:00.104
Right. 'Cause you just do it.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.339
Instead of reasoning with her,

23:02.363 --> 23:04.575
stopping her from
doing something illegal,

23:04.599 --> 23:07.845
like a mentor would do,
you just cover for her.

23:07.869 --> 23:10.881
That's my business. My decision.

23:12.756 --> 23:14.500
Meredith Grey could commit murder,

23:14.524 --> 23:15.835
and you'd hide the body.

23:15.859 --> 23:17.403
You know what? I really
don't have the energy

23:17.427 --> 23:19.105
for this right now.

23:19.129 --> 23:21.707
You cheated the system

23:21.731 --> 23:24.477
to get Meredith into my program.

23:24.501 --> 23:27.447
No, that was my program.

23:27.471 --> 23:30.316
And I did not cheat.
I wrote a recommendation.

23:30.340 --> 23:32.574
You chose to go around the system

23:32.599 --> 23:34.310
to get Meredith Grey her way,

23:34.334 --> 23:35.611
no matter the consequences.

23:35.635 --> 23:37.179
And you've been doing it ever since.

23:37.203 --> 23:40.082
You choose her! You always choose her!

23:40.106 --> 23:43.686
My God. You sound... jealous.

23:44.978 --> 23:48.090
Well, I'm getting enough
of that from my wife.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.515
Hey. How was the trial?

24:01.539 --> 24:03.551
I-I was really surprised
neither side called me in.

24:03.575 --> 24:06.087
I moonlight as an expert witness.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.846
I need you to operate.

24:09.047 --> 24:11.559
Wow. You trying to up my bad outcomes?

24:11.583 --> 24:12.727
Tom.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.061
Well, now, whoever smelt it dealt it.

24:14.085 --> 24:16.146
This one's all you, Shepherd.

24:16.821 --> 24:19.133
This man killed my brother
on an O.R. table

24:19.157 --> 24:21.302
because he refused to order a CT scan.

24:21.326 --> 24:23.037
And now I have found a massive

24:23.061 --> 24:25.539
hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

24:25.563 --> 24:27.275
He needs a craniotomy. Can you do it?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.542
Shepherd.

24:28.566 --> 24:30.035
Can you do it?

24:30.635 --> 24:33.080
I'll cancel the rest of my day.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.004
Thank you.

24:42.704 --> 24:44.783
Evacuating the hematoma...

24:44.807 --> 24:46.117
gel foam...

24:47.476 --> 24:51.791
Here we go. Nice and steady.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.399
Nicely done.

25:11.170 --> 25:14.349
Look, I'm not gonna pretend that I never

25:14.373 --> 25:15.984
give Meredith special treatment.

25:18.144 --> 25:20.355
There is a history.

25:20.379 --> 25:23.058
- Her mother.
- Yes.

25:23.476 --> 25:25.187
Meredith is family.

25:25.211 --> 25:26.855
And she also happens
to be one of the more

25:26.879 --> 25:28.757
brilliant surgeons that I've ever taught.

25:28.781 --> 25:33.362
So sometimes putting my career
in jeopardy for her...

25:33.386 --> 25:36.899
is just what you do for family.

25:37.311 --> 25:38.788
Glad to know where I fit in.

25:38.812 --> 25:40.223
That's not what I meant.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.192
Tom Koracick is my boss.

25:42.216 --> 25:45.587
Because of your actions.
Because of Meredith's actions.

25:45.611 --> 25:49.148
Because you chose to help her
instead of coming to me.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.450
If I'd have come to you,

25:50.474 --> 25:51.784
my wife would have fired you, too!

25:51.808 --> 25:53.353
Did you not hear the part
where I just said

25:53.377 --> 25:55.255
- Tom Koracick is my boss?!
- You didn't lose your job!

25:55.279 --> 25:57.157
Meredith is fighting for her license!

25:57.181 --> 25:59.459
No, I've lost more than my job!

25:59.483 --> 26:00.960
I've lost my hospital!

26:00.984 --> 26:03.596
I lost my best surgeons.
And my best friend.

26:03.620 --> 26:07.233
All because someone I thought
I raised betrayed me.

26:07.257 --> 26:09.301
Now, do you know how that feels?

26:09.927 --> 26:12.172
It hurts pretty bad, doesn't it?

26:12.196 --> 26:13.339
That's right.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.175
I stuck my neck out for her

26:15.199 --> 26:18.185
because I know she'd do the same for me.

26:19.119 --> 26:23.033
And until recently,
I thought you would, too.

26:29.496 --> 26:31.441
Thank you all for your patience.

26:31.746 --> 26:33.524
The Medical Commission has decided

26:33.548 --> 26:35.492
to postpone Dr. Grey's hearing.

26:35.516 --> 26:38.562
Most likely, an entirely new
hearing will take place,

26:38.586 --> 26:40.664
based on today's events.

26:40.688 --> 26:42.099
You can't postpone.

26:42.123 --> 26:45.244
Dr. Karev, we're not exactly
holding a town hall.

26:45.269 --> 26:46.479
Can you please find a seat?

26:46.503 --> 26:48.181
No, you can't postpone
because these people

26:48.205 --> 26:50.917
have come from all over
to speak for Meredith.

26:50.941 --> 26:52.418
I-I'm sorry. What people?

27:29.116 --> 27:31.127
Were all these people
on the witness list?

27:31.151 --> 27:32.429
No idea.

27:32.453 --> 27:35.432
You gonna tell them all
they need to go home?

27:51.646 --> 27:53.257
I was trapped in an ambulance,

27:53.281 --> 27:55.159
upside down, soaked in my own blood,

27:55.183 --> 27:57.728
while my best friend was dead beside me.

27:57.752 --> 28:00.464
It was the most scared I've
ever been in my entire life.

28:00.758 --> 28:02.135
And what did Dr. Grey do?

28:02.159 --> 28:03.870
She climbed into the damn thing with me.

28:03.894 --> 28:05.205
Admitted she was scared, too.

28:05.229 --> 28:08.942
Then she proceeded to stab me in
the chest with a giant needle.

28:08.966 --> 28:11.011
Which saved my life.

28:11.035 --> 28:13.580
When Dr. Grey diagnosed
the tumor in my liver,

28:13.604 --> 28:14.681
I retired.

28:14.705 --> 28:16.917
I gave my cats away to my daughter,

28:16.941 --> 28:18.285
bought a pair of designer shoes,

28:18.309 --> 28:20.487
and splurged on the trip of my dreams.

28:20.511 --> 28:21.788
And now I'm broke.

28:23.395 --> 28:25.940
Dr. Grey pioneered such
an incredible surgery,

28:25.964 --> 28:27.875
I had to go to the
superintendent of schools

28:27.899 --> 28:29.610
and beg for my job back.

28:29.634 --> 28:33.014
She diagnosed my cancer
and saved my life.

28:33.038 --> 28:35.049
And my treatment's being done pro Bono.

28:35.073 --> 28:37.261
And Dr. Grey saw to that.

28:37.286 --> 28:39.163
She hasn't claimed credit for it,

28:39.187 --> 28:40.565
but I know she did it.

28:40.589 --> 28:42.834
I guess I met her on
her very first day as a doctor.

28:42.858 --> 28:44.536
And it showed. I mean, someone needed

28:44.560 --> 28:46.137
to help her unlock the wheels
of the gurney.

28:46.161 --> 28:48.473
She was green. And I was just awful.

28:48.497 --> 28:51.743
But on Dr. Grey's very
first day as a doctor,

28:51.980 --> 28:53.624
she was the only one
that could figure out

28:53.648 --> 28:54.959
what was wrong with me.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.794
And because of her, I am sitting here,

28:56.818 --> 28:58.629
with a newborn baby girl at home,

28:58.653 --> 29:01.766
and I just hope that I can give her back

29:01.790 --> 29:05.224
a little of the help that she gave to me.

29:07.462 --> 29:10.908
Hemorrhage has been evacuated.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.861
Miraculously, if I do say so myself.

29:13.885 --> 29:14.862
Drain, please.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.530
How you doing?

29:17.388 --> 29:19.157
Do you want to go somewhere?

29:20.024 --> 29:21.702
I want to stay.

29:22.193 --> 29:24.505
I have dreamt about this day.

29:24.975 --> 29:26.920
I have dreamt that the world
would be fair and just

29:26.944 --> 29:28.755
and that the man on that table
might experience

29:28.779 --> 29:32.492
a fraction of the pain that
he caused when his arrogance

29:32.516 --> 29:35.340
took away my favorite person
in the entire world.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.364
And I thought...

29:38.388 --> 29:40.266
if I saw inside that man's skull,

29:40.290 --> 29:43.836
I might jam a scalpel
into his motor cortex

29:43.860 --> 29:45.934
just to paralyze him.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.697
Just so that he would
have to lie in a bed

29:48.721 --> 29:50.865
for the rest of his life
knowing what he took

29:50.889 --> 29:52.734
from me and Meredith...

29:52.758 --> 29:54.860
and the kids, my mom.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.662
I think we should stay.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.110
Thank you.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.846
But up here...

30:04.870 --> 30:07.838
far away from the scalpels.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.286
And, you know, I...

30:11.768 --> 30:13.846
I could get us some popcorn if you want.

30:16.306 --> 30:18.684
Damn it.

30:23.496 --> 30:26.308
"Dear Medical Commission,
people who know me

30:26.332 --> 30:28.477
would describe me as selfish to a fault.

30:28.501 --> 30:29.945
After that, they'd say honest.

30:29.969 --> 30:31.880
I can honestly tell you
that if I were dying

30:31.904 --> 30:34.683
and a surgery stood between me and death,

30:34.707 --> 30:36.452
Dr. Grey's hands are the only ones

30:36.476 --> 30:38.754
that I'd want inside my body.

30:38.778 --> 30:41.356
Taking away her license is
signing the death certificates

30:41.380 --> 30:43.392
of countless future patients.

30:43.416 --> 30:46.862
She is a light in a broken
system that she will fix,

30:46.886 --> 30:48.664
whether you want her to or not.

30:48.688 --> 30:52.101
She is the sun, and she is unstoppable.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.721
Sincerely, Dr. Cristina Yang."

31:01.351 --> 31:02.462
Um, I have more.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.465
I've got, uh, Dr. Calliope Torres,

31:05.489 --> 31:07.733
uh, Dr. Arizona Robbins,

31:07.757 --> 31:09.268
Dr. April Kepner...

31:09.292 --> 31:11.671
That's enough. Thank you. That's fine.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.772
Um, no, I can keep going if you want.

31:13.797 --> 31:14.774
- It's fine.
- Addison Montgomery.

31:14.798 --> 31:16.176
- You don't?
- That's good.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.111
- Okay.
- Good.

31:18.135 --> 31:19.251
He sparked a re-bleed.

31:19.275 --> 31:20.433
Pressure's through the roof.

31:20.457 --> 31:21.514
Can you get control?

31:21.538 --> 31:22.715
Suction.

31:22.739 --> 31:24.214
- V-Fib.
- Push one of epi.

31:24.239 --> 31:27.352
Let's get him flat
and get the paddles ready.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.093
Thank you, everyone,
for your time. Again.

31:35.117 --> 31:37.228
Uh, now, if I could please have
everyone clear the room.

31:37.252 --> 31:39.664
Uh, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

31:39.688 --> 31:42.895
Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. Your Honor.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.798
Uh, I... I have something more to say

31:44.822 --> 31:46.166
about Meredith Grey.

31:46.190 --> 31:48.202
For God's sakes, who doesn't?

31:48.226 --> 31:51.572
Okay, well, ever since
I first met Meredith Grey...

31:51.596 --> 31:54.675
I knew she was going to be
a thorn in my side.

31:54.699 --> 31:56.443
You're worried about her breaking rules?

31:56.467 --> 31:57.711
Well, that's not gonna stop.

31:57.735 --> 31:59.413
She's been doing that since day one.

31:59.437 --> 32:03.780
And, yes, she broke a law to save a life.

32:04.609 --> 32:07.354
So she deserved to lose her job.

32:07.378 --> 32:09.690
She deserves to pick up trash.

32:09.714 --> 32:13.394
No one should be questioning her license.

32:13.418 --> 32:15.929
She's too good at what she does.

32:15.953 --> 32:18.932
And she's worked too hard
to get to where she is.

32:18.956 --> 32:20.768
And with all...

32:20.792 --> 32:23.737
all that she has survived,

32:23.761 --> 32:27.141
it hasn't made her... hard.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.212
It hasn't made her mean or... or cold.

32:30.236 --> 32:32.548
It hasn't made her not care.

32:32.572 --> 32:34.394
It's made her...

32:36.062 --> 32:37.786
better.

32:37.810 --> 32:40.489
It's made her better
than anyone in this room.

32:42.548 --> 32:44.493
Well, except me.

32:44.517 --> 32:46.650
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey,

32:46.677 --> 32:51.057
chief of surgery
at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.961
And I approve this message.

33:10.034 --> 33:11.311
He's gone.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.777
Castello didn't make it.

33:47.801 --> 33:49.946
Wasn't me. I didn't kill him.

33:50.294 --> 33:52.138
Should I be blaming myself
for yelling at him?

33:52.162 --> 33:53.973
No, he gets all the blame.

33:53.997 --> 33:55.775
Not only was he a terrible
doctor to patients,

33:55.799 --> 33:58.678
but he forgot that high blood
pressure's the silent killer.

33:58.702 --> 34:00.772
And, boy, did he let it get to him.

34:04.908 --> 34:06.953
- Tell me.
- They're not postponing.

34:06.977 --> 34:10.018
Uh, should one of us tell them
that their panel chair died?

34:10.043 --> 34:11.987
Ooh. They'll ask when they're ready.

34:12.012 --> 34:13.889
Right now, they're sending
their recommendation

34:13.914 --> 34:15.492
to the Medical Commission.

34:15.516 --> 34:16.617
- What?
- Okay.

34:16.641 --> 34:17.761
It's a majority vote.

34:17.784 --> 34:20.664
So even if Castello voted
to suspend Meredith's license,

34:20.688 --> 34:23.766
the other two doctors voted
to drop the entire thing.

34:23.791 --> 34:25.802
- It's over.
- I still have my license?

34:25.826 --> 34:27.704
Yes. And I'm so grateful it's over

34:27.728 --> 34:29.505
because you're one of
the most exhausting clients

34:29.530 --> 34:30.674
I've ever had.

34:30.697 --> 34:32.909
Congratulations, Dr. Grey.

34:32.933 --> 34:35.145
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah!

34:35.168 --> 34:38.514
- Aww.
- Congratulations.

34:38.539 --> 34:40.751
Thank you. Thank you. Good job!

34:58.134 --> 35:00.846
You said some very nice things
to the panel in there.

35:00.870 --> 35:02.584
Thank you.

35:03.272 --> 35:06.284
Uh, so, um, see you Monday then.

35:06.308 --> 35:08.053
What?

35:08.077 --> 35:09.591
Come back.

35:10.546 --> 35:12.057
I'm sorry?

35:12.081 --> 35:15.093
Come back to Grey Sloan.

35:15.117 --> 35:16.394
Ooh.

35:16.418 --> 35:19.664
You are a pain in my ass.

35:20.060 --> 35:22.367
But you're a fine surgeon.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.070
And your name's on the damn sign.

35:25.565 --> 35:27.651
And I need you.

35:28.597 --> 35:31.510
So you fired me and now
you want me to come back?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.512
You want me to beg?

35:36.622 --> 35:38.166
Thank you.

35:40.159 --> 35:41.836
Is that a yes?

35:42.332 --> 35:44.105
That's a big, fat yes.

35:47.399 --> 35:49.344
I'll see you Monday.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.607
I hate to bring this up now, but have you

35:59.373 --> 36:02.052
seen or heard anything
with Richard and my mom?

36:02.076 --> 36:03.420
Any idea how they're doing?

36:03.444 --> 36:05.289
You're asking the wrong person.

36:05.313 --> 36:07.391
Right. Sorry.

36:07.777 --> 36:10.155
I just didn't know if maybe
he mentioned anything...

36:10.179 --> 36:11.545
before.

36:13.249 --> 36:15.427
And do you think, um...

36:15.451 --> 36:17.729
think they're having some problems?

36:17.753 --> 36:22.601
I don't know. It's just kind of
a sense that I get. I guess.

36:22.625 --> 36:25.437
I mean, it can't be easy.

36:25.461 --> 36:27.172
With him being fired

36:27.196 --> 36:29.241
and working somewhere else...

36:29.266 --> 36:31.177
...and her traveling all the time.

36:31.201 --> 36:32.645
Owen.

36:32.669 --> 36:35.047
Mer gets to keep her license.

36:35.071 --> 36:37.083
Yay, Mer!

36:37.107 --> 36:39.003
I didn't help at all.

36:39.028 --> 36:40.972
You did help by not testifying.

36:45.201 --> 36:46.900
Wow.

36:49.972 --> 36:51.905
This is kind of nice.

36:54.176 --> 36:55.780
Not fighting?

36:56.478 --> 36:58.366
I've missed it.

36:58.948 --> 37:01.793
You. I guess I missed you.

37:01.817 --> 37:03.795
Us being able to talk,

37:03.819 --> 37:06.220
knowing what's going on
in each other's lives.

37:24.873 --> 37:26.050
Ah, I can't. I'm sorry.

37:26.074 --> 37:29.017
I can't. I shouldn't.
Obviously, I'm in something...

37:29.042 --> 37:31.320
Oh, my God. Uh, you should leave.

37:31.344 --> 37:32.555
Okay. We can...

37:32.579 --> 37:35.925
No. Get out, Jackson. Go. Get out now!

37:45.959 --> 37:47.236
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:47.260 --> 37:50.173
Congrats on your license.

37:50.197 --> 37:52.074
Thanks.

37:52.098 --> 37:54.010
Maggie, what just happened?

37:54.034 --> 37:56.145
I hate someone I used to love.

37:56.169 --> 37:59.446
Don't let him in.

37:59.471 --> 38:01.550
I don't want to see
or speak to him ever again.

38:01.574 --> 38:03.818
Okay, okay.

38:08.647 --> 38:09.991
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:10.015 --> 38:12.527
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.144
Extraordinary measures can have a cost.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.169
You may be alive,

38:17.193 --> 38:19.171
but life may not be the same
as you remember.

38:26.269 --> 38:28.873
Didn't think you had it in you, Schmitt.

38:29.472 --> 38:32.818
I just heard Schmitt here
was the one who ratted out Grey.

38:32.842 --> 38:36.822
Damn, man. You're lucky
she kept her license.

38:44.915 --> 38:46.927
Your body may not move as easily.

38:51.022 --> 38:52.399
Feelings may be gone.

38:58.129 --> 39:01.008
And it can take a long time to recover.

39:01.032 --> 39:02.699
I'm sorry.

39:02.967 --> 39:04.678
I'm sorry for what I said.

39:04.702 --> 39:07.114
I... I didn't mean
that we wouldn't make it.

39:07.139 --> 39:08.984
I just... I don't know.

39:09.008 --> 39:11.319
I don't know what I meant.
I-I was scared.

39:11.343 --> 39:14.055
Mer, don't. Okay? Y-You meant it.

39:14.079 --> 39:15.323
No, I-I didn't.

39:15.347 --> 39:16.925
I stood up for you in court.

39:16.949 --> 39:19.461
I defended you at the hospital.

39:19.485 --> 39:20.829
I went to jail for you.

39:20.853 --> 39:23.565
I know, and I didn't ask you
to do any of those things.

39:23.589 --> 39:25.667
I know. But I did it anyway
because I love you.

39:25.691 --> 39:27.135
Because I'd do anything for you.

39:27.159 --> 39:30.405
Because that's what you do
for your partner.

39:30.691 --> 39:33.937
But I'm not your partner.

39:33.961 --> 39:35.672
Am I?

39:35.696 --> 39:38.508
There's a reason
it's a difficult decision.

39:38.532 --> 39:41.978
The look in your eye when
you spoke about Derek today

39:42.002 --> 39:43.513
made me realize what it is
I've been feeling

39:43.537 --> 39:45.283
this whole time.

39:46.006 --> 39:48.385
You didn't just love Derek.

39:48.409 --> 39:50.288
You respected him.

39:51.245 --> 39:52.823
That's different.

39:52.847 --> 39:54.580
And you can't compare.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.672
- I do respect you.
- Come on.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.640
Y-You're telling me there's
not some small part of you

40:00.664 --> 40:02.075
that doesn't wonder if I'm your equal?

40:02.099 --> 40:03.977
If I'm at your level? If I ever will be?

40:08.772 --> 40:11.226
Take some time, Meredith.

40:11.775 --> 40:13.811
Figure out what it is that you want.

40:14.478 --> 40:16.022
And...

40:19.617 --> 40:21.795
Let me know if I'm a part of that.

40:23.621 --> 40:25.026
Good night.

40:28.425 --> 40:31.266
You just have to decide
if it's all worth it.
