Ooh!
[growls]

00:25.543 --> 00:27.084
- Mommy!
- Aaaaaaah!

00:27.086 --> 00:29.028
- Duncan!
- Duncan!

00:32.033 --> 00:35.492
- Come to me.
Give me the good stuff, Daddy.

00:36.762 --> 00:38.612
[grunts]
You're mine!

00:38.688 --> 00:39.613
[grunts]

00:39.765 --> 00:40.998
- Please, I have children!

00:41.950 --> 00:43.450
- [gasps]
The value pack is here!

00:43.602 --> 00:44.601
The value pack is here!

00:44.620 --> 00:46.787
- If I'm like that at 40,
shoot me.

00:46.863 --> 00:48.380
- You got it.

00:48.532 --> 00:51.032
- Duct cleaning,
carpet steaming...

00:51.110 --> 00:52.867
[gasps]
Cheese on pie,

00:52.961 --> 00:55.295
the Tollman's Semi-Annual
Boys' Pants Sale.

00:55.447 --> 00:57.798
- No way you're getting Duncan
to go shopping.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.374
- Last time you tried
to take him to buy socks,

00:59.451 --> 01:02.394
he bit you.
- It still hurts when it rains.

01:02.546 --> 01:05.305
But this time, I have a plan.
Duncan!

01:05.457 --> 01:08.216
- Ugh, what?
I talked to you yesterday.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.294
- Dunkie, how would you like
to go shopping

01:10.296 --> 01:12.738
for that Cyclops visor
you've been wanting,

01:12.815 --> 01:15.299
the one that makes lasers
shoot out of your lives.

01:15.317 --> 01:18.911
- Ugh, the visor doesn't make
lasers shoot out of your eyes.

01:18.987 --> 01:21.747
It regulates the lasers
that shoot out of your lies

01:21.898 --> 01:23.824
due to a genetic mutation,
but yeah,

01:23.976 --> 01:25.292
that sounds great.
Thanks, Mommy.

01:26.812 --> 01:28.145
- I bite her all the time,

01:28.163 --> 01:30.464
and she doesn't
take me anywhere.

01:34.336 --> 01:36.261
- So in order
to shoot optic beams,

01:36.413 --> 01:38.155
I will need to mutate my eyes.

01:38.157 --> 01:39.823
Don't freak out.
It won't cost money.

01:39.825 --> 01:41.767
I can just stare into the sun
more than normal.

01:41.918 --> 01:43.418
- Uh-huh, that's nice, Dunkie.

01:43.495 --> 01:45.253
- Mom, no, where are we going?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.998
You said we were having lunch
at Hooters!

01:48.016 --> 01:50.943
- Hey, this isn't
the Doja Cat concert!

01:51.094 --> 01:52.444
- Wait, something's not right.

01:52.596 --> 01:56.532
- No, no, tell me more
about those laser eyes.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.177
- No, traitor!

02:00.270 --> 02:01.102
[metal clanks]

02:01.196 --> 02:03.864
- [laughs]
Not this year, boyo.

02:04.016 --> 02:06.441
- Come on, son,
activate eye lasers!

02:06.460 --> 02:08.544
Oh, my eyes!

02:10.631 --> 02:13.190
- Excuse me, spunky sales gal,

02:13.192 --> 02:16.284
would you measure
my growing son's inseam?

02:16.362 --> 02:18.879
- Okay, sweetie,
hop up on my pedestal.

02:19.031 --> 02:20.472
Let's see how long it is.

02:20.549 --> 02:22.457
- Mom, why are you
watching this?

02:22.534 --> 02:23.717
Turn around.

02:23.793 --> 02:25.702
- He's gotten to be a big boy,
hasn't he?

02:25.795 --> 02:26.979
- He just had a spurt.

02:27.055 --> 02:29.130
- Teenage boys
and their spurts.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.983
- Oh, my God,
please stop saying "spurt."

02:31.134 --> 02:33.152
- Okay, Dunkie,
go try these on.

02:34.638 --> 02:36.046
I'm so sorry about him.

02:36.048 --> 02:38.048
- He's actually
much better than last year.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.575
- Thank you
for dropping the charges.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.886
How do they fit?

02:42.888 --> 02:44.479
- Great.
Let's go.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.889
- Let me see.

02:45.908 --> 02:47.666
You haven't even tried them on!

02:47.817 --> 02:49.150
- I'm not taking
my clothes off.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.152
Everyone knows this place
posts videos

02:51.230 --> 02:53.988
on German websites for pervs!

02:54.066 --> 02:56.199
- Tell you what,
just try these pants on,

02:56.235 --> 02:58.902
and I'll get you
that "born to die" tattoo

02:58.904 --> 02:59.845
you've always wanted.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.496
- I know
you're tricking me again,

03:01.573 --> 03:02.681
but on the offhand chance
you're not,

03:02.832 --> 03:04.183
I'll do it.

03:05.594 --> 03:06.393
- Ugh.

03:07.671 --> 03:10.189
- Four comforters,
slightly damaged luggage,

03:10.340 --> 03:13.600
and a conversation about
the cashier's foot surgery?

03:13.677 --> 03:15.101
What a great day.

03:15.178 --> 03:17.437
Oh, my God,
I forgot to use my coupon.

03:17.589 --> 03:20.014
That's the only reason we came.
[laughs]

03:20.092 --> 03:22.701
Isn't that funny?
Duncan, did you hear me?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.778
Duncan, about the coupon?

03:24.930 --> 03:26.121
Be right back.

03:31.603 --> 03:33.212
- Ugh!

03:33.363 --> 03:34.546
Wha?

03:34.623 --> 03:36.548
Whoa, is that a knife?

03:38.219 --> 03:41.111
Damascus steel
with a mother of pearl handle,

03:41.129 --> 03:43.430
embossed with a Celtic symbol.

03:44.466 --> 03:45.307
Oh.

03:46.209 --> 03:50.062
Awesome. Today I become a man.

03:50.213 --> 03:53.290
- I'm glad I ran back in
'cause briefs are on sale.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.550
Here, I'll hold the towel.
You can try 'em on.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.793
- [grumbles softly]

03:56.812 --> 03:58.570
<i> - [grunting]</i>
<i> Ah!</i>

03:58.722 --> 03:59.738
[grunts]
Ah!

03:59.889 --> 04:01.965
Oh!
Ah!

04:01.984 --> 04:02.908
I don't know
what sex feels like,

04:03.059 --> 04:04.301
but it can't feel
as good as this.

04:04.319 --> 04:05.410
[knock at door]

04:05.654 --> 04:07.913
- Dunkie, do you know anything
about the 24 holes

04:07.990 --> 04:09.322
in this couch cushion?

04:09.475 --> 04:11.992
- Or "Duncan Rulz" being carved
into the toilet seat?

04:12.068 --> 04:13.827
- Clearly the work of Jing.
Get out.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.812
- [gasps]
Our son is armed, Jack.

04:15.831 --> 04:17.572
He's got a knife.
- Calm down.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.317
I know how to handle a knife.
[grunting]

04:20.319 --> 04:21.167
See?

04:21.320 --> 04:23.820
Your precious furniture
is fine.

04:23.822 --> 04:24.988
- Give me that!

04:25.007 --> 04:27.007
You'll kill yourself
and everyone around you!

04:27.159 --> 04:28.767
- I'm tired of you
treating me like a baby.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.844
I've got hair
in five new places.

04:30.996 --> 04:32.329
Number three will shock you.

04:32.347 --> 04:34.922
- You know, Annie, I did
get a knife when I was his age

04:34.924 --> 04:35.941
in Boy Scouts.

04:36.092 --> 04:37.776
It was a good way
to learn responsibility.

04:37.927 --> 04:40.837
- Yeah, I can use the knife
to help around the house,

04:40.856 --> 04:43.507
chopping carrots,
gutting mackerel,

04:43.509 --> 04:46.343
defending our home
during the Purge.

04:46.361 --> 04:47.677
Please.

04:47.679 --> 04:49.955
- Duncan and I fighting
back-to-back in a purge,

04:50.032 --> 04:51.456
I could use the help, honey.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.458
- New hair in five places, huh?

04:53.535 --> 04:56.110
Well, maybe I do need
to let you grow up a little,

04:56.130 --> 04:59.856
my fuzzy, little wuzzy--
sorry, sorry.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.300
<i> [electronic bloops and bleeps]</i>

05:01.376 --> 05:03.785
- Ugh, we're pinned down.

05:03.879 --> 05:05.119
- Commander Wolf,
what do we do?

05:05.197 --> 05:06.212
- Flank 'em from the sides.

05:06.289 --> 05:08.031
I'll come behind
and tear 'em a new one.

05:08.050 --> 05:10.534
- I will die for you, my king!
- Now!

05:10.552 --> 05:13.061
- Oh, they're lighting
my ass up!

05:14.706 --> 05:16.631
- Ding.
Order's up, bitch.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.800
<i> [all screaming]</i>

05:18.877 --> 05:19.893
[all cheer]

05:19.969 --> 05:21.486
- Wolf, I don't believe in war,

05:21.563 --> 05:23.547
but you just make it
so much fun.

05:23.565 --> 05:24.656
- Stab!

05:24.808 --> 05:26.641
[grunting]

05:26.660 --> 05:29.219
Ugh, screw it.
Hey.

05:29.221 --> 05:30.645
- Dude, that screen
was the only thing

05:30.664 --> 05:33.056
keeping out this camper's
rightful owners.

05:33.058 --> 05:35.650
- Don't yell at me.
Yell at my little friend.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.485
[hums dramatic tune]

05:37.504 --> 05:38.986
[laughter]

05:39.064 --> 05:40.488
- What's so funny?

05:40.566 --> 05:42.841
- Oh, it's just the idea
of you with a knife.

05:42.918 --> 05:45.177
You're more of a yo-yo guy.

05:45.253 --> 05:46.920
- Yeah, it's like a monkey
with a guitar,

05:47.072 --> 05:48.421
hilarious but not natural.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.256
- You're not even allowed
to use paper straws

05:50.333 --> 05:52.759
at school after all
your eye jabbing accidents.

05:52.911 --> 05:54.411
[laughter]

05:54.429 --> 05:56.671
- You guys think
I'm some sort of clown?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.190
- No, that's me.

05:58.266 --> 06:00.600
I'm the clown,
Yangzi is the swag,

06:00.752 --> 06:03.177
Mia is the brains,
and Wolf's the alpha.

06:03.255 --> 06:05.939
That leaves you
the lovable goofball.

06:06.015 --> 06:08.015
- Who's our goofball?
- You are.

06:08.093 --> 06:10.760
- Yes, you are.
- You're a good, goofy boy.

06:10.762 --> 06:12.262
- Quit tousling me!

06:12.280 --> 06:14.264
- Listen, D,
just give the blade to Wolf.

06:14.282 --> 06:16.375
You're not a knife guy.
- Says who?

06:16.526 --> 06:19.044
- Says those Jessica Simpson
low-rise jeans.

06:19.195 --> 06:21.121
- My mom's coupons
had exclusions.

06:21.273 --> 06:22.756
Come on,
let's just play the game.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.959
- Mia, you get flash bombs.
Bex, grenades.

06:26.035 --> 06:29.370
Yangzi, flamethrower.
Duncan, you get the yo-yo.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.139
- Ugh.

06:32.951 --> 06:35.710
- Aw, Duncan died?
Sad, but life goes on.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.880
- No, we're donating his pants
to those in need.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.065
- Why would you give things
to charity

06:40.292 --> 06:41.441
when you can make money
for yourself?

06:41.476 --> 06:42.734
- I'm listening.

06:42.978 --> 06:44.978
- You can sell your old clothes
online at Stitch-U-Ation,

06:45.072 --> 06:47.072
the clunkily named
thirdhand clothes website.

06:47.223 --> 06:48.298
- I don't know.

06:48.634 --> 06:51.635
Strangers walking around
in my little boy's pants?

06:51.653 --> 06:52.986
What does it pay?
- Lots.

06:53.062 --> 06:54.913
Someone sold a Rastafarian
Bart Simpson shirt

06:55.064 --> 06:56.397
for $1 million.

06:56.417 --> 07:00.143
- Oh, I just cleaned
the bathroom with mine!

07:00.162 --> 07:02.587
- We were gonna donate
this stuff like idiots.

07:02.739 --> 07:03.980
How does it work, Kimberly?

07:03.999 --> 07:05.239
- All we do
is post a picture of you

07:05.317 --> 07:07.150
holding Duncan's
smelly old clothes,

07:07.152 --> 07:08.760
call them distressed,
and then just wait

07:08.912 --> 07:10.411
for the money to roll in.
- Wait?

07:10.431 --> 07:11.579
I hate waiting for something

07:11.657 --> 07:13.915
I didn't know existed
ten minutes ago.

07:13.992 --> 07:15.158
- Well, you don't have to wait
too long.

07:15.177 --> 07:16.843
You just got your first offer,

07:16.995 --> 07:19.012
but it isn't for Duncan's
stank-ass jeans,

07:19.164 --> 07:20.346
it's for
your plumber shirt, Dad.

07:20.499 --> 07:21.665
- Never.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.443
Your mother hand embroidered
my name on this.

07:24.519 --> 07:27.687
- They offered 75 bucks
for that and Mom's track pants.

07:27.839 --> 07:29.689
[together]
75 bucks?

07:29.841 --> 07:32.525
- Ugh!
- Screw you, charity!

07:32.602 --> 07:35.512
[humming upbeat melody]

07:35.514 --> 07:37.864

07:37.941 --> 07:40.125
[humming upbeat melody]

07:42.129 --> 07:44.629
- Mmm, stolen burritos.

07:44.706 --> 07:47.223
When you don't earn 'em,
they're just tastier.

07:47.225 --> 07:49.617
- Wolf, please regale us
with the spellbinding story

07:49.636 --> 07:52.195
of how you pulled off
this spicy heist.

07:52.197 --> 07:54.030
- I pushed a Postmates guy
off his scooter.

07:54.032 --> 07:56.700
- Damn!
- Love that story!

07:56.702 --> 08:00.370
- Yeah, well, I got us
these extra straws.

08:00.463 --> 08:01.271
Ow.

08:05.393 --> 08:07.544

08:07.546 --> 08:10.230
- How does that goose
always know when we have food?

08:10.306 --> 08:12.139
- Okay, be cool, be cool.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.550
What up, Fat Ricky?

08:13.552 --> 08:14.642
- [honking aggressively]

08:14.720 --> 08:16.828

It's alpha time.

08:19.983 --> 08:22.334
Come on, man, I don't want
to have to pluck you up today.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.728

08:24.746 --> 08:25.912
You and what gaggle?

08:28.567 --> 08:30.250
Whoa, ow, ow.

08:30.402 --> 08:31.176
- Chill out!

08:31.345 --> 08:33.845
Take all of our food
and our wallets.

08:33.997 --> 08:36.130
[geese honking aggressively]
- Ugh.

08:36.241 --> 08:38.742
- How do you want your friends
to see you, Duncan,

08:38.760 --> 08:41.186
as yo-yo boy or knife man?

08:41.337 --> 08:43.170
- Yeah, I'm sick
of being the goofball

08:43.190 --> 08:45.840

I've got hair on my butt crack.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.174
That was number three
by the way.

08:47.252 --> 08:49.236

I'm your pants.

09:00.189 --> 09:02.023
- Damn, Wolf,
I thought you were a goner.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.266
- I had it handled.

09:03.285 --> 09:04.117
I was just weighed down

09:04.436 --> 09:05.544
by eating
that double meat burrito.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.271
- Duncan, you just cut a bag
right out of a goose's mouth.

09:08.273 --> 09:10.273
Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

09:10.275 --> 09:13.051
Guess my knife man instinct
kicked in.

- My king.

- Bex, chalupa.
Yangzi, tostada.

09:23.212 --> 09:26.047
Mia, fish tacos.
Wolf, yo-yo.

09:26.124 --> 09:27.816
It came with the kids' meal.

09:29.218 --> 09:31.628
- Cheer up, Wolf, and be sure
to check out my line

Tough break, Wolf.

11:59.869 --> 12:00.885
You're in a lot of pain.

Yes, I am the alpha,

if you spread the word.

- Cool, let's meet up
after school, Big D.

12:07.953 --> 12:09.953

Normally you'd be wearing
your underwear

12:16.903 --> 12:19.237
as a headband by now.
- I'm not surprised.

12:19.388 --> 12:21.055
I bet they want me
in their crew.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.966
- You shouldn't have
called yourself the alpha.

I won't bail on you guys
