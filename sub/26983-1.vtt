01:30.090 --> 01:32.008
Yeah, yeah,
I had a lot of fun.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.469
I mean, I drank too much.

01:35.719 --> 01:38.763
Well, yeah, I hadn't seen
anybody for a really long time,

01:38.765 --> 01:42.350
you know, so it was a
lot of hi, how are you,

01:42.352 --> 01:44.521
what have you been up
to, blah, blah, blah.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.148
Yeah, I kind of remembered
people, I don't know.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.859
I'm talking quietly
because I'm really hungover

01:51.861 --> 01:53.445
and loud sounds hurt my head.

01:55.197 --> 01:57.740
Oh, come on, you've got three
hours on me.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.285
This hardly seems fair.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.621
No, no, I gotta, I gotta go.

02:04.623 --> 02:06.834
I'm sorry, I need more sleep,
okay?

02:09.627 --> 02:13.798
Yeah, yeah, I'll talk
to you later, mmm hmm.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.429
I love you too.

02:20.056 --> 02:20.890
Bye.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.122
A medical drama, right.

03:27.039 --> 03:28.205
What is this?

03:28.207 --> 03:29.042
Yeah.

03:57.653 --> 04:00.906
Hey, checking the time.

04:02.908 --> 04:04.116
You got an early flight?

04:04.118 --> 04:05.745
Ah, you know,
I got a little time.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.500
But, you know,
yeah, we can,

04:13.502 --> 04:14.960
I can head out if you're busy.

04:14.962 --> 04:17.212
I just, I have a long
shoot tonight,

04:17.214 --> 04:18.296
- you know, so I should
- Yeah, yeah.

04:18.298 --> 04:20.759
- probably go back to sleep.
- No problem.

04:34.690 --> 04:37.401
I'm sorry, I can't find
my phone.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.034
Did you leave it in the Lyft?

04:47.036 --> 04:48.452
No.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.288
I don't think so.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.459
Are you sure?

04:55.127 --> 04:57.963
Can you
call it please?

04:58.882 --> 05:00.839
Can you call it please, Syd?

05:00.841 --> 05:02.259
Will you hand me my phone?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.060
What's your number?

05:11.810 --> 05:13.020
Oh never mind, I got it.

05:19.026 --> 05:20.817
It goes straight to voicemail.

05:20.819 --> 05:23.320
Yeah, I might've left it in
the car.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.156
Did I call it or did you?

05:25.158 --> 05:25.992
I did.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.872
Can you check, please, see if I
left it?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.082
The faster you help
me find this,

05:35.084 --> 05:37.168
the faster I can get outta here.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.004
You're fine.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.506
Thank you.

05:44.259 --> 05:45.094
Okay.

05:46.178 --> 05:47.387
What?

05:47.389 --> 05:49.598
We have to wait for
him to get back to us.

05:51.016 --> 05:53.269
Uh, should I wait upstairs?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.191
Could I wait down here?

06:00.776 --> 06:02.611
I'm going to sleep.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.529
I have to work tonight.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.782
You can stay if you want.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.434
You didn't have a good time
last night?

06:36.187 --> 06:39.605
No, no, I had expectations,
I guess.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.735
Well, so did I.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.237
Did I somehow not meet them?

06:46.572 --> 06:49.072
When we worked together,
you were, you know,

06:49.074 --> 06:50.658
much more pleasant.

06:52.411 --> 06:56.538
We were flirting and you
didn't really know me back then

06:56.540 --> 06:58.416
and you definitely don't
know me now.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.002
That's fair, I don't know you.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.759
So, tell me something, anything,

07:07.761 --> 07:09.262
about you.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.721
Like what?

07:12.723 --> 07:14.014
Like where you're from.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.099
I told you where I'm from.

07:16.101 --> 07:17.351
Ask me something better.

07:17.353 --> 07:21.731
All right,
how 'bout

07:23.276 --> 07:27.152
what is the most
interesting place

07:27.154 --> 07:31.200
that you've ever had sex,
like in public or something?

07:32.369 --> 07:33.409
In front of people?

07:33.411 --> 07:36.120
Yeah, or like, you know, like
the woods.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.581
Well, all the working girls
have had sex in the woods.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.957
It's like a coming of
age thing here.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.043
Oh, that's so primitive.

07:47.550 --> 07:51.469
Hey, you know, since we're
stuck here, you know,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.348
figured I'd just throw
this out there.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.309
I know I could've been,
you know,

07:57.810 --> 08:02.397
a little more generous
last night, you know.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.233
Yeah.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.822
So, how do you want me to?

08:10.531 --> 08:11.365
What?

08:13.992 --> 08:17.870
You know, want me to
take care of you.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.206
You know, lick the cat, paint
the wall, unpack the box.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.082
Oh, my God!

08:22.084 --> 08:25.836
What, shut the fuck up.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.046
Oh, but I don't get second
chances now?

08:27.048 --> 08:27.882
No.

08:29.968 --> 08:30.800
- Lick the cat?
- I'm sorry.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.174
What are you even...

08:32.177 --> 08:34.261
I just, I didn't think
you'd actually be offended

08:34.264 --> 08:35.261
- by that.
- I'm making coffee,

08:35.264 --> 08:36.472
do you want some?

08:36.474 --> 08:37.307
Sure.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.477
You're a guy.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.774
I resent statements like that.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.108
Like what?

08:48.110 --> 08:52.405
To assume that I'm just
driven uncontrollably by sex.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.157
I bet you think that every
dude who talks to you

08:55.159 --> 08:57.160
is hitting on you, even
when he says simple shit

08:57.162 --> 08:58.120
like good morning.

08:59.330 --> 09:03.791
No, but I do think many
guys under most circumstances

09:03.793 --> 09:06.377
would have sex with most women.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.546
And you think we
can help that.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.383
Yeah, I think you can.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.765
Let's drop that.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.061
I've got a question for you.

09:23.270 --> 09:24.103
In your movie,

09:24.105 --> 09:24.938
Yeah.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.400
why did you decide
on the ending?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.363
How do you mean?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.032
Well, life isn't like that.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.326
I don't think that there's
just one special person

09:39.328 --> 09:40.662
out there for us.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.290
Yeah, it's a nice
thought, though, isn't it?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.753
I don't think it is such
a nice thought really.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.088
I mean there's so many
people in the universe.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.217
It's sad to think that we each
can connect

09:54.219 --> 09:55.052
with only one.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.262
So you didn't like the movie.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.890
No, I told you I did.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.267
And you weren't just
telling me what you thought

10:03.269 --> 10:04.560
I wanted to hear?

10:04.562 --> 10:07.065
Wow, I didn't know you
were so insecure.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.982
And you're not.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.571
Mmm, no, my mom raised me
to be a little too confident.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.283
And your dad?

10:19.284 --> 10:20.703
He didn't raise me.

10:23.081 --> 10:23.914
Yep.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.333
- Don't...
- All the signs

10:27.335 --> 10:28.459
- are there, Sydney.
- Not all girls

10:28.461 --> 10:31.880
who come from broken homes
have daddy issues, okay?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.009
Well yes, come on
that's not what I meant.

10:42.307 --> 10:45.435
Uh look, I'm gonna have to
chalk this phone up to a loss

10:45.437 --> 10:47.147
if they don't get
back to you soon.

10:52.027 --> 10:52.944
Still nothing.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.409
Why do you look so upset?

11:02.412 --> 11:03.245
I'm all right.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.415
Right, well, I'm sorry.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.877
I just had a really big crush
on you

11:10.879 --> 11:14.171
when we were shooting
and I was just hoping

11:14.173 --> 11:17.509
it would be, you know?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.096
All right.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.225
No, what was so bad about it?

11:27.144 --> 11:30.063
You, uh, jammed your dick in
my mouth

11:30.065 --> 11:32.565
until you got hard and then
you couldn't keep it up

11:32.567 --> 11:33.940
long enough to have sex.

11:33.942 --> 11:36.611
Wow, well, thank you for
holding back.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.527
I'm sorry.

11:37.529 --> 11:39.365
Mmm hmm, and you farted in
your sleep.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.949
I did that while I was awake.

11:42.951 --> 11:43.785
Don't laugh.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.161
That's not funny.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.039
I apologize for being
a human being.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.634
You snore and you
grind your teeth.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.387
Well, I don't wear my mouth
guard when men sleep over.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.930
Sydney, I'm a good lover.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.016
Wouldn't know it.

12:06.850 --> 12:07.849
So I used to be, huh?

12:07.851 --> 12:09.643
Oh God, ugh.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.478
What?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.814
Stop saying lover!

12:12.816 --> 12:15.065
And stop being so serious,
all right?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.236
Nobody's gonna wanna fuck the
sad guy.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.864
Good talk, Sydney.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.451
Dude, where are you going?

12:26.453 --> 12:27.911
Upstairs.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.415
Well, what about your phone?

12:35.296 --> 12:38.091
Look if you're gonna stay
then yes, I want you to.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.098
To what?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.184
To take care of me.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.617
You know you're fucking crazy,
right?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.451
Mmm hmm.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.286
Are you a Gemini?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.119
No.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.081
There we go.

14:21.903 --> 14:22.734
Don't laugh at me.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.070
I'm always laughing at you.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.363
Stop laughing at me.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.698
Well, stop being goofy.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.531
I can't.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.784
Mmm.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.668
Mmm.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.710
Hmm.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.545
Hmm?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.046
Mmm.

14:42.048 --> 14:42.879
Uh oh.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.172
- Uh.
- Oh well.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.007
Yeah.

14:45.009 --> 14:45.842
Sorry.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.177
Don't apologize.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.555
Yeah, I'm not really sorry.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.223
I know.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.559
Rule number one in my bed,

14:54.561 --> 14:55.729
you have to be honest.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.103
Brutally honest, even.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.104
Mmm hmm.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.195
I'm clean, by the way.

15:06.155 --> 15:06.989
Good.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.369
Are you?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.372
You'll find out in two weeks.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.748
See, that's not funny.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.501
You know, shouldn't we have
had this conversation before?

15:20.503 --> 15:23.628
Yes, I usually
do, but you know, last night

15:23.630 --> 15:26.007
was kind of spontaneous,
I guess.

15:26.009 --> 15:26.842
Hmm.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.177
Well, in my book if
you don't ask,

15:30.179 --> 15:31.470
then you deserve to
worry a little.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.097
That's so evil.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.223
What is wrong with you?

15:34.225 --> 15:37.562
When was the
last time you were tested?

15:40.148 --> 15:42.773
It's been awhile.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.441
But it's fine 'cause
you know, everybody else

15:44.443 --> 15:46.401
I've been sleeping with
gets tested regularly

15:46.403 --> 15:47.570
so we're good.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.073
Well, that's fucking stupid.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.991
Syd, relax, I'm playing,
I'm fine.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.119
I don't have anything.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.453
All right, I don't, you know,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.454
I don't even have
sex very often.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.956
When was
the last time?

15:59.958 --> 16:01.876
It's been months.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.795
You need to have
sex more often.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.796
Oh, okay, well I'll sign
up for it, just check it out.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.964
No, seriously.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.884
Like I remember how wound
up you used to be, you know.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.222
You were always so intense.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.561
I guess, you know, like to
think I'm kinda funny, too.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.814
Mmm.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.315
When?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.277
Syd, I say funny things all
the time.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.283
You wore glasses when
we worked together.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.786
Is that all you remember?

16:37.788 --> 16:38.871
I don't know.

16:38.873 --> 16:43.834
I remember, uh, you were
a hard worker.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.670
Yeah.

16:47.256 --> 16:51.800
Oh, I remember that you used
to walk around the set barefoot

16:51.802 --> 16:53.344
all the time.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.805
And that you had a toe ring.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.515
And that you had
pretty cute feet.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.062
Why, you have a foot thing?

17:05.275 --> 17:06.190
You do.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.691
Oh, it's
embarrassing.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.568
No, it's okay.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.862
Oh, this is
embarrassing.

17:10.864 --> 17:11.903
Do you wanna touch mine?

17:11.905 --> 17:13.196
Oh my God, Syd, stop.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.910
- Syd, what is wrong with you?
- Oh you do.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.704
Ba bum, bum, bum.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.708
Syd.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.376
You can kiss 'em if you want.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.381
Nobody ever lets me do this.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.007
Well, why not?

17:32.594 --> 17:33.886
I don't know.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.850
Guess I don't go around telling
people that I like feet.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.735
I feel so silly.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.571
Why?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.783
Why didn't we ever
do this before?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.076
We didn't know we could.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.581
Do they smell?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.665
- Mmmm.
- Oh!

18:04.667 --> 18:06.084
No, come here, I don't mind.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.125
- No, I do.
- I don't mind 'em.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.169
Uh.

18:09.005 --> 18:09.839
Oh.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.634
Not the car?

18:15.636 --> 18:16.596
Nope.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.265
You're popular today.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.477
I have to go to work soon-ish.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.313
Already?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.148
Wanna hear something honest?

18:29.233 --> 18:30.067
Yeah.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.365
I thought about you
a lot over the years.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.033
What did you think?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.119
I don't know, what
you were doing,

18:41.121 --> 18:42.288
what your life was like.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.915
I work in reality TV now.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.667
Reality.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.669
Well, I don't like scripted.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.795
Sydney.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.712
I like writing.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.963
I just don't like scripted.

18:52.965 --> 18:57.134
We had no budget, no time,
no time.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.304
And we made a great
film with $3,000.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.764
No, no, no,
you belong in scripted.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.891
We need to work together again,
too.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.434
- Huh!
- Yeah.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.811
Reality is just so...

19:06.813 --> 19:08.688
Reality is not
what's wrong with America.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.105
I wasn't gonna say that.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.650
I'm getting out of it anyway.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.444
TV?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.114
Film, everything.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.823
I'm kinda done.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.240
Why?

19:20.242 --> 19:22.200
Because I work all the time

19:22.202 --> 19:24.705
and I don't have benefits.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.999
You know, it just, I'm
realizing I don't wanna do this

19:29.001 --> 19:30.252
for the rest of my life.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.296
So you're really not passionate
about this anymore, huh?

19:33.298 --> 19:34.840
I didn't say that.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.801
And passion doesn't go away.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.011
It just, it moves
around a little

19:41.013 --> 19:42.806
and you just have
to find it again.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.683
Can I ask you a question?

19:46.685 --> 19:47.519
Yeah.

19:48.563 --> 19:51.730
And, you know, just
I'm gonna throw this out,

19:51.732 --> 19:55.485
I might sound like a
16-year-old girl

19:55.487 --> 19:57.154
and I'm okay with that
,

20:00.450 --> 20:03.286
did you unfriend me on Facebook
after the movie wrapped?

20:04.828 --> 20:05.702
Oh shit.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.582
Ah, mmm, nope I noticed.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.918
'Cuz I looked for you
specifically

20:11.920 --> 20:15.882
and all I could see was
your profile picture.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.221
Are you gonna
ask me why?

20:22.305 --> 20:23.139
The wrap party?

20:24.140 --> 20:26.391
I knew you had a crush
on me and I obviously

20:26.393 --> 20:27.725
had a crush on you.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.562
But I knew you
were with someone.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.023
So when we kissed,
everything got

20:34.025 --> 20:36.736
a little too real for me.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.654
You know, just one second
I went away to get beers

20:40.656 --> 20:43.074
and I came back
and you were gone.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.241
Sorry.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.826
Nah, that's okay.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.080
I guess it's funny now,
ha ha ha ha ha.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.874
Yeah, it never woulda worked
out anyway.

20:52.876 --> 20:55.085
You know, workplace
romance and all.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.838
Yeah, totally unprofessional.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.674
Mmm hmm.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.721
Are you seeing someone
right now?

21:04.638 --> 21:05.472
Uh.

21:08.143 --> 21:11.853
I just, you know,
got out of a thing.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.064
I guess it's a break up.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.982
How 'bout you?

21:16.984 --> 21:18.652
Any recent break ups?

21:19.988 --> 21:20.822
Not really.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.782
This is the honesty bed,
isn't it?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.366
Mmm hmm, yeah.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.039
Do you like me,
Sydney?

21:31.624 --> 21:34.459
Don't take advantage
of rule number one, okay?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.959
Okay.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.462
And also does this
work for you?

21:38.464 --> 21:41.591
Telling everybody everything,
every emotional current

21:41.593 --> 21:44.134
that runs through your
mind just blah.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.057
I think people need to
say what's on their mind.

21:48.892 --> 21:49.726
Huh.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.353
Sydney, it doesn't
bother you that we're just

21:54.355 --> 21:56.814
wandering around on a
blue ball floating

21:56.816 --> 21:57.648
in the middle of the universe

21:57.650 --> 21:59.984
and nobody is talking about it?

21:59.986 --> 22:01.153
That shit is crazy.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.403
Right?

22:03.405 --> 22:06.116
Like here we are sitting
in a bed together,

22:07.035 --> 22:09.454
not doing anything about it.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.831
Nope.

22:13.833 --> 22:18.335
But I know that I want to be
in this bed

22:18.337 --> 22:21.298
with you all day.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.761
This will probably never
happen again.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.513
You don't know that.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.846
Mmm, this is how we are.

22:29.848 --> 22:33.769
You know, we find these
tiny little grooves,

22:35.521 --> 22:36.980
we make these connections.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.194
And then we meet someone else.

22:45.656 --> 22:49.991
We just bounce around
meeting people, some good,

22:49.993 --> 22:51.286
some bad, some weird.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.670
Until we find another groove
and make another connection.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.507
But some, some of these moments,

23:04.509 --> 23:06.176
these connections,
these grooves,

23:10.390 --> 23:11.516
they need to be longer

23:13.351 --> 23:14.392
so that we can remember

23:14.394 --> 23:18.772
them clearer, better.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.067
You're real deep, huh?

23:24.069 --> 23:27.363
All right, stop.

23:27.365 --> 23:32.535
No, I, I don't know
if there's serendipity

23:32.537 --> 23:36.374
or poetry in everything,
you know.

23:38.585 --> 23:42.130
I just think things happen the
way they do

23:43.757 --> 23:46.716
and not always the way
they're supposed to.

23:46.718 --> 23:51.473
I know that I want to
be here with you, here,

23:53.307 --> 23:56.144
as long as I possibly can.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.106
But we smell like alcohol
and my vagina.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.775
And my breath is awful.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.609
- It is.
- Ugh.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.610
That's very true.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.443
That is not a lie at all.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.279
See.

24:08.990 --> 24:09.947
My breath is bad too.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.282
I don't even have a toothbrush

24:11.284 --> 24:13.617
and it's a first world
problem but it's a problem.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.956
I mean, we should
definitely stay in touch.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.879
Don't look at me like that.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.384
Uh.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.178
I wanna kiss you.

24:50.865 --> 24:55.870
Are you trying to get
sex from me before you go?

24:56.413 --> 24:58.080
Sit down over there.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.809
You're perfect.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.625
Let's come at the same time.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.420
Can I come on your face?

25:47.422 --> 25:48.379
No.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.255
Sorry.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.237
I'm getting close.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.309
You want a towel.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.479
No, it's okay.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.773
Come here.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.328
If we're gonna stay in
bed all day,

27:03.330 --> 27:04.623
I've got another rule.

27:05.875 --> 27:06.960
What's that?

27:07.919 --> 27:11.047
Rule number two, you can't
wear pants.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.134
I'm not wearing pants,
so deal.

27:19.763 --> 27:23.224
Rule number three, no leaving
the bed.

27:23.226 --> 27:26.436
♪ Turn it down ♪

27:26.438 --> 27:28.020
Shake on it.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.815
♪ Turn it down ♪

27:33.153 --> 27:35.361
♪ Turn it down ♪

27:35.363 --> 27:37.697
♪ Now now ♪

27:37.699 --> 27:40.074
♪ Turn it down ♪

27:40.076 --> 27:42.325
♪ Turn it ♪

27:42.327 --> 27:44.786
♪ Turn it down ♪

27:44.788 --> 27:46.038
♪ Now now ♪

28:06.102 --> 28:07.852
Oh, mine
looks like a paper labia.

28:07.854 --> 28:08.980
Can you show me again?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.521
You're so close.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.981
Come on, you already,
you just gotta...

28:12.983 --> 28:14.984
No, just
gotta flip it under then.

28:14.986 --> 28:16.361
Okay, what did you do?

28:16.363 --> 28:17.487
I don't know.

28:17.489 --> 28:18.528
Oh, no, it's really close.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.030
Just fold that under.

28:20.032 --> 28:20.864
Okay.

28:20.866 --> 28:21.783
- That's the head.
- Yeah.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.284
Mmm hmm, you're close,
you're close.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.117
- Keep going.
- Well, I think,

28:24.119 --> 28:25.204
I think you kinda...

28:26.373 --> 28:27.205
- I don't understand.
- Just fold it.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.456
Does the director really need

28:28.458 --> 28:30.335
a thousand of these
just because?

28:31.461 --> 28:34.879
He said he wanted a
thousand folded paper cranes

28:34.881 --> 28:38.882
behind the talking head of
this interview just because.

28:38.884 --> 28:39.717
Why do you have to it?

28:39.719 --> 28:41.469
You all don't have PAs?

28:41.471 --> 28:43.431
Yeah, but everybody bailed.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.181
I'm only doing a hundred.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.019
Yes, 'cause a
thousand is overkill.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.395
Hold on, hold on.

28:51.397 --> 28:56.316
I mean, the wings are low,
but, but, but.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.194
- You finished one!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.030
- I did!
- Yes!

29:01.115 --> 29:02.864
- Okay that was weird action.
- I don't know why.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.616
Throw it, throw it.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.576
- Yay!
- Woo!

29:06.578 --> 29:07.411
Boom, all right,
do another one.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.578
I'm gonna, oh, okay,

29:08.580 --> 29:11.164
I think I'm gonna hit
that after intermission.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.258
You like living here?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.095
Yeah, I do actually.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.305
Where would you live,
you know,

29:27.307 --> 29:28.852
if you didn't live in Portland?

29:30.019 --> 29:33.603
New Orleans,

29:33.605 --> 29:36.106
- Atlanta, New York.
- Yuck.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.403
Los Angeles,
it's where it's at.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.194
Just shake the overcast.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.238
No, I don't really mind it,

29:42.240 --> 29:46.952
but I do like the beach
and the sun, don't you?

29:47.787 --> 29:48.954
Mmm, I don't need it.

29:50.664 --> 29:53.583
Mmm, I do need food, though.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.879
Oh, we should eat something.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.963
We made a pact to not leave
the bed.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.048
But I'm hungry.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.382
Yeah, you're right,
you're right.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.633
Ba food.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.469
Yeah.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.054
Ah.

30:06.056 --> 30:09.265
Floor clause.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.475
Floor clause.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.642
Yep, second it so we
can pass.

30:11.644 --> 30:12.477
- You pass, all right, cool.
- I second the floor clause.

30:12.479 --> 30:13.643
You're damn
right you do.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.687
Oh, what are you doing?

30:14.689 --> 30:17.065
You second
that fucking floor clause.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.607
- That's right.
- Oh no.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.317
Oh God, don't, don't do that.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.986
Sit there and be the wind.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.363
I saw this in a movie once.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.238
What are you doing?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.076
Genius.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.284
I'm a fucking genius.

30:28.286 --> 30:30.077
What the fuck amazing

30:30.079 --> 30:30.911
- is what I'm being.
- Oh my God.

30:30.913 --> 30:31.746
Please don't hurt yourself.

30:31.748 --> 30:32.705
I'm not gonna hurt myself.

30:32.707 --> 30:33.875
Oh, God, here we go.

30:35.335 --> 30:37.209
That's right, take it all in,
sweetheart,

30:37.211 --> 30:38.878
- take it all in.
- Oh my God!

30:41.048 --> 30:42.882
They should make
this shit an Olympic event.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.257
- Oh, don't hurt yourself.
- Ah, here we go.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.468
There's a step.

30:45.470 --> 30:46.803
Yeah, I see, I see
the step

30:46.805 --> 30:48.304
in your split level studio.

30:49.766 --> 30:50.597
Whose idea was that?

30:50.599 --> 30:52.016
It makes it look it bigger.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.977
Because that
makes a lot of fucking sense.

30:54.979 --> 30:55.853
Here we go.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.190
I have kale chips.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.525
Fuck gonna do with kale chips?

31:00.527 --> 31:02.651
Did you ever fucking
go grocery shopping?

31:02.653 --> 31:03.819
No, I actually don't.

31:03.821 --> 31:07.699
You've got tangerines and a
Keurig so

31:07.701 --> 31:09.033
that's where we are.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.870
Uh, how's grits sound?

31:11.829 --> 31:12.703
Grits.

31:12.705 --> 31:13.537
- I like grits.
- Great, 'cause

31:13.539 --> 31:15.288
that's the only thing
in your kitchen.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.373
Grits are delicious.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.375
Yeah, apparently so
are kale chips.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.210
And that's just weird.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.047
Okay.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.634
I gotta say, I really like
this view.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.555
You got a dirty bowl,
come clean out your sink.

31:30.557 --> 31:34.558
My back.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.018
Oh, man.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.562
I need to take a picture of you.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.646
You don't need
to take a picture honestly.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.231
Just asked you.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.734
Oh, oh.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.568
Not the first time
you've seen an ass before.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.946
Oh, I wish it was just
the ass I was seeing.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.574
I'm winded,
that's for damn sure.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.533
You see that damn much.

31:50.535 --> 31:51.659
Well, you're
working pretty hard.

31:51.661 --> 31:52.910
I'm working
pretty hard.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.411
Okay, well, it should
be good.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.287
It should be good.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.538
Fine, I'm gonna take it out.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.623
If they're lukewarm grits I
don't wanna hear shit about it.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.959
You're gonna burn something
and it's

32:00.961 --> 32:01.960
- not gonna be pleasant.
- Not gonna burn something.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.129
It'll be all right.

32:03.131 --> 32:04.756
You know how much it costs
to get a six-foot black dude

32:04.758 --> 32:06.507
with grits delivered to
your bed?

32:06.509 --> 32:07.382
What the fuck?

32:07.384 --> 32:08.343
Probably in the
thousands.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.303
Why do you have so
many rugs in your house?

32:10.305 --> 32:11.970
I thank you for your help.

32:11.972 --> 32:12.805
You wanna get you
a couple chairs

32:12.807 --> 32:14.097
and come over here and help me.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.182
No, all right, no.

32:15.184 --> 32:16.017
- That's fine.
- No, I think I'm good.

32:16.019 --> 32:16.892
- No, it's cool
- I don't like

32:16.894 --> 32:17.768
- what you're doing.
- It's cool.

32:17.770 --> 32:18.603
- I'm gonna stay over here.
- Your bra's still on it.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.478
What's the nearest hospital

32:19.480 --> 32:21.605
in case I actually
do almost die?

32:21.607 --> 32:22.606
I don't know.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.232
- All right, well...
- It's 911.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.276
It's all the same number.

32:25.278 --> 32:28.071
All right, well you
dial 'cause you're white.

32:30.491 --> 32:31.615
- I'm fine.
- Oh!

32:31.617 --> 32:32.784
Can you not,
show a little confidence.

32:32.786 --> 32:33.785
- Okay.
- You're low

32:33.787 --> 32:35.161
and I'm not falling
off a fucking building.

32:35.163 --> 32:36.411
- You're good.
- Don't be so dramatic.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.331
- Can I, can I help you?
- Stop these things.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.500
Oh, now you wanna help.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.918
I just crawled across your
floor with butt ass naked

32:41.920 --> 32:44.253
on a chair and now you wanna
help me.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.962
This is why we can't have nice
things.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.963
- Be careful.
- You ready?

32:46.965 --> 32:47.923
- Yeah.
- You be careful now.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.133
I'm back now, move, so you can
see, move.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.052
Ready?

32:51.054 --> 32:51.885
Oh yeah, uh!

32:52.721 --> 32:55.139
Yep, like a graceful
fucking swan.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.391
- Wow!
- That was impressive, right?

32:56.393 --> 32:57.642
That was amazing.

32:57.644 --> 32:58.934
You're goddamn right it was.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.103
That was one of the coolest
things I think I've ever seen

33:00.105 --> 33:01.062
in my life.

33:01.064 --> 33:01.978
Oh, that's
'cause you live in Portland.

33:04.442 --> 33:06.150
You know you need to stop
being so rude about Portland.

33:06.152 --> 33:06.984
- I know.
- Portland is actually

33:06.986 --> 33:07.985
pretty awesome.

33:07.987 --> 33:08.819
I see, I see.

33:08.821 --> 33:09.778
Hold on I'm gonna
fix your pillows

33:09.780 --> 33:11.113
- like Martha fucking Stewart.
- Thank you.

33:11.950 --> 33:12.784
Okay.

33:15.286 --> 33:16.496
Mmm.

33:18.123 --> 33:19.788
It's so good.

33:19.790 --> 33:20.623
I make movies.

33:20.625 --> 33:21.498
I can tell when you're lying.

33:23.961 --> 33:24.919
- Mmm, it's good.
- Yeah.

33:24.921 --> 33:26.586
It's like instant regret.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.133
Yep.

33:29.342 --> 33:30.509
We'll put that over there.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.471
Come here.

33:37.307 --> 33:38.141
Great kiss.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.435
Mmm, that's...

33:40.854 --> 33:42.605
I never thought this
would happen.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.315
And yet here we are.

33:51.364 --> 33:54.907
You know, we hardly
know each other.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.075
I don't feel that.

33:57.077 --> 33:57.912
No?

34:00.373 --> 34:02.789
Well, I did push back
work for you.

34:02.791 --> 34:03.708
You did.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.500
Well, you didn't have to, I
thank you.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.463
Yeah, they'll call me when
they need me.

34:09.507 --> 34:12.215
Hey, you think we would've
been friends

34:12.217 --> 34:13.052
like in school?

34:14.054 --> 34:15.052
You're way too nice.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.054
I'm not that nice
once you get to know me.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.054
You're too sensitive.

34:18.056 --> 34:18.972
Too sensitive?

34:18.974 --> 34:20.349
Okay.

34:20.351 --> 34:23.061
I just hung out
with bitchy girls

34:23.063 --> 34:25.731
and we made fun of people.

34:26.940 --> 34:27.775
Yeah.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.235
I don't know if you and
I would've been friends.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.527
You know, I went through phases
and stuff,

34:33.530 --> 34:34.987
like a rebellious phase.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.989
Hmm, rebellious how?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.452
I'd sneak out and smoke pot.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.661
Oh!

34:40.663 --> 34:44.206
Oh, nothing
wildly original.

34:44.208 --> 34:49.004
But my dad had a camera
and I'd go on long walks

34:50.255 --> 34:51.090
and make movies.

34:52.634 --> 34:54.302
Studied at NYU, right?

34:56.929 --> 34:58.431
That is intimidating.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.305
Well you didn't
go to Tisch

35:00.307 --> 35:02.057
and you turned out fine.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.101
Mmm.

35:03.103 --> 35:04.519
You know, I think you're
more confident

35:04.521 --> 35:05.689
than you think you are.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.315
Thanks?

35:14.322 --> 35:15.947
Your parents, are they
still together?

35:15.949 --> 35:17.322
Oh, yeah.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.327
There are no divorces
in the Graham family.

35:21.996 --> 35:23.664
Yeah, but should
there be?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.999
They annoy the fuck out of
each other,

35:27.001 --> 35:28.168
but they stay together.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.463
It's a lost art.

35:32.590 --> 35:33.550
Do you want that?

35:39.472 --> 35:43.727
I want to not go on so many
first dates.

35:45.228 --> 35:49.146
You know, I get tired of
giving the same information

35:49.148 --> 35:51.525
about myself to
different people.

35:52.985 --> 35:54.193
Gets old.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.528
Yeah.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.487
Yeah, I don't, I don't really
think people

35:57.489 --> 36:01.159
wanna settle down
anymore though, you know.

36:01.161 --> 36:03.452
There's too may options.

36:03.454 --> 36:06.206
Hmm, enough to keep
you busy for a lifetime.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.836
A lifetime of swiping
left and right.

36:15.342 --> 36:18.219
I don't think people know
how to be happy anymore.

36:21.681 --> 36:22.766
Well, are you happy?

36:29.646 --> 36:30.898
I don't know.

36:33.860 --> 36:34.693
I don't think so.

36:37.947 --> 36:38.782
Well, why not?

36:40.742 --> 36:43.867
You can't just ask someone
why they're not happy, Sydney.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.246
You know, it's,

36:47.248 --> 36:49.416
it's a variety of factors.

36:53.588 --> 36:54.711
Mmm.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.046
Well, name one.

36:56.048 --> 36:59.217
Just one?

37:01.012 --> 37:01.844
For starters.

37:01.846 --> 37:05.099
For starters, um,
I don't think

37:06.768 --> 37:10.271
I'm where I'm supposed to
be at this age in my life.

37:12.148 --> 37:14.106
But I'm here and you then you
know, you can't turn around.

37:14.108 --> 37:16.735
There's no turning back.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.739
Really too late to start over.

37:20.907 --> 37:23.407
You know those where do
you see yourself

37:23.409 --> 37:25.784
in 15 to 20 years
projects they make you do

37:25.786 --> 37:26.620
in middle school?

37:27.539 --> 37:28.871
Yeah, that shit's a set up.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.289
Yeah.

37:31.291 --> 37:32.124
That's just something
for you to look back on

37:32.126 --> 37:36.253
be like damn I was overzealous.

37:38.048 --> 37:39.925
Why am I even explaining
this to you?

37:41.385 --> 37:44.889
I think you know that
I won't judge you.

37:51.688 --> 37:52.814
You won't will you?

37:54.690 --> 37:55.524
Mmm nnn.

37:59.028 --> 38:00.405
I'm sad a lot.

38:06.702 --> 38:08.036
Me too.

38:10.289 --> 38:15.295
Hey, you know, I love
how creative you are.

38:17.880 --> 38:18.963
I do.

38:18.965 --> 38:23.303
You just, you go out there
and you do what you do.

38:24.679 --> 38:26.012
You know, I don't have that.

38:26.014 --> 38:27.140
I'm not doing that.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.143
I envy that about you.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.316
I love how direct you are.

38:39.318 --> 38:42.153
How you can communicate,
I mean, and effectively.

38:42.155 --> 38:44.490
You know, everything you feel,

38:46.617 --> 38:50.286
everything you wanna say,
you know.

38:50.288 --> 38:53.706
Some people spend a
lifetime not knowing

38:53.708 --> 38:58.003
what they want to say or how
they feel about anything.

38:59.172 --> 39:00.798
How many movies have you made?

39:03.967 --> 39:04.802
Three.

39:05.804 --> 39:07.347
I think you're
doing just fine.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.684
What makes you happy?

39:13.186 --> 39:14.019
Hmm.

39:17.065 --> 39:19.733
Days like this with
people like you.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.537
You know, your face looks young.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.664
Mmm hmm.

39:34.666 --> 39:38.959
But your hands are
old-looking, like old man hands.

39:38.961 --> 39:39.793
Thank you for that.

39:39.795 --> 39:43.715
I appreciate it.

39:43.717 --> 39:44.884
You know what's weird?

39:46.552 --> 39:49.722
One day, we're gonna be dead.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.224
Oh God, Sydney, move.

39:53.226 --> 39:54.057
- No, seriously.
- Move.

39:54.059 --> 39:54.976
Don't you think about that?

39:54.978 --> 39:57.603
Like, like I could just die
right now.

39:57.605 --> 39:58.896
Sydney!

39:58.898 --> 39:59.896
Really?

39:59.898 --> 40:02.150
Seriously, that's where we are?

40:02.152 --> 40:03.403
Stop saying words.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.907
Have you ever thought
about your funeral?

40:14.873 --> 40:15.706
No.

40:20.336 --> 40:22.628
How would you like to die?

40:22.630 --> 40:24.755
And don't say in your sleep.

40:24.757 --> 40:26.717
And remember this is
the honesty bed.

40:28.719 --> 40:31.387
I would go to the
nearest interstate

40:31.389 --> 40:33.097
and find an overpass

40:33.099 --> 40:37.187
or to the 30th,
to the 35th floor

40:38.146 --> 40:39.979
of a downtown office building

40:39.981 --> 40:42.317
because anything
over 35 is overkill.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.276
And I would jump.

40:46.278 --> 40:50.990
And I would do it early
morning, mid-morning,

40:50.992 --> 40:53.825
or early afternoon around
that time when it's

40:53.827 --> 40:55.702
you know, really busy

40:55.704 --> 40:57.706
and everybody's trying
to get somewhere.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.126
That sends a message.

41:02.378 --> 41:06.465
That guy is, he's got
something to say.

41:08.425 --> 41:09.800
You know.

41:09.802 --> 41:11.929
And it's right there for the
world to see.

41:18.353 --> 41:19.559
You've really thought
about that.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.188
I've thought
about it recently.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.981
Well, why were you
thinking about that recently?

41:24.983 --> 41:29.153
It's a lot sometimes, Sydney.

41:29.155 --> 41:33.410
You know, sometimes,
sometimes it's too much.

41:36.413 --> 41:39.416
I wouldn't,

41:42.251 --> 41:44.045
I wouldn't go through with it,
though.

41:45.672 --> 41:47.215
My family wouldn't survive.

42:03.023 --> 42:05.233
The world would miss you.

42:06.067 --> 42:09.487
You know you, you have
this innocent quality,

42:10.487 --> 42:11.989
people wanna take care of you.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.294
I took a bunch
of pills once.

42:30.257 --> 42:31.090
When?

42:31.092 --> 42:32.090
A long time ago.

42:32.092 --> 42:33.219
Why, Sydney?

42:35.054 --> 42:36.722
I was stupid, okay?

42:37.806 --> 42:39.475
And life is scary.

42:43.771 --> 42:46.357
I didn't know how to handle it.

42:49.652 --> 42:53.740
It's, I don't understand
what made you do that.

42:55.074 --> 42:56.742
You really wanna know?

42:58.077 --> 42:59.913
It was a guy.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.418
Have you ever wanted
somebody so bad

43:07.586 --> 43:09.255
that it consumed
your whole life?

43:16.096 --> 43:19.514
On one of the biggest
nights of my life

43:19.516 --> 43:22.894
all I could think about
was a guy,

43:24.269 --> 43:26.063
a guy who didn't even
love me back.

43:32.737 --> 43:33.570
Oh.

43:34.697 --> 43:35.781
And I prayed.

43:37.617 --> 43:39.952
I don't even believe in God.

43:42.579 --> 43:43.414
It didn't work.

43:47.918 --> 43:48.752
You know.

43:52.172 --> 43:54.048
You don't always walk
out of a relationship

43:54.050 --> 43:55.635
having learned something.

43:59.764 --> 44:02.224
Hmm, I'm fine now.

44:04.643 --> 44:08.647
But those feelings, they
wouldn't go away.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.154
There was no art in it.

44:16.489 --> 44:19.240
There's nothing to
extract from it.

44:19.242 --> 44:22.412
It was just a fucking waste.

44:26.248 --> 44:27.082
Hmm.

44:30.085 --> 44:33.295
I think part of being alive

44:33.297 --> 44:35.799
is wishing you were dead.

44:41.639 --> 44:44.351
I didn't tell you this so
you would feel sorry for me.

44:45.351 --> 44:46.185
I know.

44:51.023 --> 44:52.025
Oh, phone.

45:00.199 --> 45:01.115
Oh.

45:01.117 --> 45:04.117
Hey, this time it is the car.

45:04.119 --> 45:05.121
He found your phone.

45:06.831 --> 45:07.707
Oh, yeah.

45:10.335 --> 45:12.086
Well, thank God, huh?

45:15.715 --> 45:17.048
Yeah.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.343
What time is your flight?

45:20.387 --> 45:21.388
Around six.

45:23.889 --> 45:25.141
Let me check.

45:27.059 --> 45:27.893
Want my phone?

45:28.894 --> 45:29.728
Yeah.

45:45.744 --> 45:46.578
Yeah.

45:48.331 --> 45:49.164
Yeah.

45:51.251 --> 45:52.249
Uh.

45:52.251 --> 45:54.251
You'll make it in
plenty of time.

45:54.253 --> 45:55.753
He'll be here soon enough.

45:55.755 --> 45:56.753
Yeah.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.757
I mean, you'll have
to leave soon though.

46:00.592 --> 46:04.346
Guess I should finish packing
my stuff and get ready, huh?

46:09.601 --> 46:13.440
Or we could, uh, you know,
we could go somewhere.

46:15.733 --> 46:16.773
Where?

46:16.775 --> 46:20.029
I mean , I don't
know where.

46:22.614 --> 46:24.408
Where uh, do,
would you wanna go?

46:25.952 --> 46:28.204
I don't know.

46:30.831 --> 46:31.665
I don't know.

46:35.628 --> 46:38.631
Uh, hey, can I ask
you a question?

46:41.050 --> 46:41.884
Yeah.

46:43.762 --> 46:45.597
Who is that in the picture
with you?

46:48.641 --> 46:51.311
That's Matt, my husband.

46:54.313 --> 46:55.356
Thought so.

46:56.398 --> 46:58.148
Wait, we're separated.

46:58.150 --> 47:00.275
What, when did you
ever get married?

47:00.277 --> 47:01.443
A year and a half ago.

47:01.445 --> 47:02.653
- Oh!
- All right, it was fast.

47:02.655 --> 47:04.030
No shit!

47:04.032 --> 47:05.408
Well, what are you doing?

47:08.077 --> 47:08.909
Hot lava!

47:08.911 --> 47:09.745
What?

47:12.498 --> 47:14.667
It might not work out.

47:17.878 --> 47:20.003
If you've already decided
that it might not work out,

47:20.005 --> 47:20.838
then why do you

47:20.840 --> 47:21.673
- even sit there...
- I don't know,

47:21.675 --> 47:22.507
I don't know, okay?

47:22.509 --> 47:24.425
I can't, I can't answer that.

47:24.427 --> 47:26.805
I just, don't leave.

47:28.681 --> 47:29.515
I still...

47:32.018 --> 47:36.854
Look, I actually don't think
that there are any accidents.

47:36.856 --> 47:38.146
That's stupid, Sydney.

47:38.148 --> 47:39.773
Accidents literally happen
all the time.

47:39.775 --> 47:41.983
Planes crash, ships sink,
cars crash...

47:41.985 --> 47:45.195
Coincidences, I know
there are lots of accidents.

47:45.197 --> 47:48.700
I'm, I don't think that
there are any coincidences.

47:48.702 --> 47:51.663
You were supposed to
be in my bed

47:53.123 --> 47:54.874
even if it was just for today.

47:58.585 --> 48:03.507
Matt and I have been unhealthy
for a really long time.

48:04.717 --> 48:06.969
We've done some messed
up shit to each other.

48:08.972 --> 48:09.970
We're unhappy.

48:11.891 --> 48:14.686
We tried to do the open
relationship thing

48:15.728 --> 48:19.023
because of my schedule and
that didn't really work.

48:28.742 --> 48:31.242
Where would you wanna go?

48:31.244 --> 48:34.204
You said, let's go somewhere.

48:36.166 --> 48:37.417
Where would you wanna go?

48:40.420 --> 48:41.501
On a trip?

48:41.503 --> 48:42.545
Yeah.

48:42.547 --> 48:45.088
I forgot we were even talking
about it.

48:45.090 --> 48:45.924
Come on.

48:47.092 --> 48:48.760
Hmm?

48:48.762 --> 48:50.805
If you wanna go, I'll go.

49:01.358 --> 49:02.273
I don't even...

49:02.275 --> 49:03.775
Come on.

49:03.777 --> 49:06.193
I don't even know where...

49:06.195 --> 49:07.110
- We could...
- Where, where

49:07.112 --> 49:08.570
do you wanna go?

49:08.572 --> 49:13.577
We could go to Los Angeles.

49:16.956 --> 49:17.829
Come on, we could.

49:17.831 --> 49:19.956
We could go to the observatory.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.751
We could go to the beach.

49:21.753 --> 49:23.463
We could start a
production company.

49:24.463 --> 49:28.800
Oh, wow, you're talking about,
I mean.

49:28.802 --> 49:32.135
You know, we could,
we could make movies.

49:32.137 --> 49:33.720
- We could figure it out.
- We could operate...

49:33.722 --> 49:34.847
You know, I've been writing.

49:34.849 --> 49:36.014
I've been writing too, so.

49:36.016 --> 49:36.850
Let's go!

49:38.811 --> 49:40.563
Seriously, let's just go.

49:41.648 --> 49:43.563
What, what is holding us back?

49:43.565 --> 49:44.981
- Come on.
- So you wanna go to LA

49:44.983 --> 49:48.985
and you would just wanna pitch
shit to companies all day?

49:48.987 --> 49:49.945
I don't know.

49:49.947 --> 49:51.863
Yeah, whoever'll listen.

49:51.865 --> 49:52.699
Yes?

49:52.701 --> 49:53.532
Yeah.

49:53.534 --> 49:54.367
Yeah.

49:54.369 --> 49:55.659
Yeah.

49:56.954 --> 49:58.537
Now, this is, are you serious?

49:58.539 --> 49:59.496
Don't fuck with my, Sydney.

49:59.498 --> 50:00.414
I'll get outta here
and I'm leaving

50:00.416 --> 50:01.331
and I'm not coming back.

50:01.333 --> 50:02.499
I'm not fucking with you.

50:02.501 --> 50:03.918
I'm, let's go.

50:03.920 --> 50:05.005
I'm serious, let's go.

50:05.880 --> 50:07.840
I mean, fuck, I uh...

50:09.009 --> 50:10.008
See.

50:10.010 --> 50:11.800
No, well I'm in the
middle of this shoot.

50:11.802 --> 50:13.177
I can't just leave, you know.

50:13.179 --> 50:15.679
Word gets around, I'm
never gonna work again.

50:15.681 --> 50:17.766
Aren't you getting out
of the business anyway?

50:18.893 --> 50:20.726
Yes, yes you are.

50:20.728 --> 50:21.561
So we're gonna do it.

50:21.563 --> 50:22.644
Yeah.

50:22.646 --> 50:25.981
So let's go, give me,
I need to, I gotta cancel

50:25.983 --> 50:27.485
and cancel to that...

50:28.652 --> 50:29.693
Are we really doing this?

50:29.695 --> 50:30.778
We're doing it,
we're doing it.

50:30.780 --> 50:33.072
I'm gonna get us flights now.

50:33.074 --> 50:35.115
Um, okay.

50:35.117 --> 50:35.951
Ah!

50:37.286 --> 50:38.161
Okay, put this down,

50:38.163 --> 50:39.037
- we can do that later.
- Yeah, I can, okay.

50:39.039 --> 50:39.873
Okay.

50:45.878 --> 50:46.712
Okay.

51:55.407 --> 51:56.240
Oh.

51:57.617 --> 51:58.451
Oh, fuck.

52:02.996 --> 52:04.287
Okay.

52:04.289 --> 52:05.289
What's happening?

52:05.291 --> 52:06.791
What's up?

52:16.677 --> 52:18.052
Yep, yep.

52:18.054 --> 52:19.720
Can we do that?

52:19.722 --> 52:20.849
I'm doing it.

52:22.434 --> 52:24.728
I have to pee so bad.

52:25.644 --> 52:27.811
I had to climb
on the furniture.

52:27.813 --> 52:29.604
Yeah well, you
did not have to do that.

52:29.606 --> 52:31.148
Mmm.

52:41.827 --> 52:42.661
Oh, yes!

52:44.539 --> 52:45.373
Oh.

52:46.833 --> 52:48.791
Hey, do you want some food?

52:48.793 --> 52:50.378
You know, like some actual food?

52:52.172 --> 52:53.503
I was serious when I said

52:53.505 --> 52:55.465
we were supposed to
stay in the bed.

52:55.467 --> 52:58.010
Yeah, I know,
but we could get delivery.

53:01.806 --> 53:03.639
Mmm, all right.

53:03.641 --> 53:04.976
Okay.

53:06.268 --> 53:07.809
Oh.

53:07.811 --> 53:08.645
Is Thai okay?

53:09.731 --> 53:14.025
Mmm, yeah, that's fine
as long as it's pad thai

53:14.027 --> 53:16.651
- or red curry, that's it.
- Okay.

53:16.653 --> 53:18.447
I can't believe you did this
with chairs.

53:19.324 --> 53:20.365
Uh!

53:21.201 --> 53:22.032
I can't believe you
did that with pillows.

53:22.034 --> 53:23.036
Oh, man.

53:24.704 --> 53:26.912
Did that almost as
gracefully as you.

53:26.914 --> 53:28.289
The jump's not easy, is it?

53:28.291 --> 53:30.166
That was kinda fun.

53:30.168 --> 53:31.208
Yeah.

53:31.210 --> 53:33.045
Pad thai, red curry.

53:34.713 --> 53:36.296
Hey, that's a workout.

53:36.298 --> 53:37.965
Yeah, now you're
winded.

53:37.967 --> 53:39.092
See how it feels?

53:42.972 --> 53:44.262
Hello.

53:45.266 --> 53:46.641
Yes.

53:46.643 --> 53:48.892
Hi, can I order
something for delivery?

53:48.894 --> 53:53.900
I would like pad thai and
red curry with chicken.

53:54.525 --> 53:55.941
Is chicken okay?

53:55.943 --> 53:57.070
Why 'cause I'm black?

53:59.072 --> 54:00.320
And brown rice.

54:00.322 --> 54:02.032
You too good for
white rice now?

54:04.034 --> 54:06.869
Yes, I am at

54:06.871 --> 54:10.706
3405 Southeast Ankeny.

54:10.708 --> 54:11.542
Card.

54:12.793 --> 54:13.752
Thank you.

54:15.463 --> 54:17.295
'Cuz I'm black.

54:17.297 --> 54:18.296
You had to go there.

54:18.298 --> 54:19.923
You didn't have to
get brown rice.

54:19.925 --> 54:22.010
I did, I like brown rice.

54:22.012 --> 54:23.594
I bet.

54:26.516 --> 54:27.347
Hey.

54:27.349 --> 54:28.349
Yes.

54:28.351 --> 54:30.101
You had a movie
come out yesterday.

54:30.103 --> 54:31.184
I did.

54:31.186 --> 54:33.104
You did.

54:33.106 --> 54:34.524
Have any reviews come out?

54:35.692 --> 54:37.025
I don't know,
I don't read reviews.

54:37.027 --> 54:38.650
Why?

54:38.652 --> 54:39.776
Mmm nnn.

54:39.778 --> 54:40.864
Hmm, okay.

54:42.865 --> 54:45.450
What are ya, what are you
doing there?

54:45.452 --> 54:46.953
I'm lookin'.

54:48.704 --> 54:49.538
Sydney.

54:50.956 --> 54:52.206
I don't wanna hear it.

54:52.208 --> 54:53.543
Okay.

54:56.045 --> 54:57.336
What if it's good.

54:57.338 --> 54:59.046
Yeah, for some reason

54:59.048 --> 55:00.548
I only read the bad ones.

55:00.550 --> 55:01.384
Hmm.

55:02.510 --> 55:03.508
Okay.

55:03.510 --> 55:04.762
Mmm.

55:07.849 --> 55:09.100
Mmm.

55:10.976 --> 55:11.810
What?

55:12.936 --> 55:13.771
Nothing.

55:15.148 --> 55:17.106
What, I thought you said
you didn't wanna read 'em.

55:17.108 --> 55:19.527
What that reaction, yeah,
I wanna know.

55:21.487 --> 55:22.778
Okay.

55:24.199 --> 55:27.992
While budgetary limitations
were no doubt a factor,

55:27.994 --> 55:30.494
there's so little attempt
at being cinematic

55:30.496 --> 55:34.414
that we get a rare sequence
actually driven by visuals

55:34.416 --> 55:36.668
rather than dialogue.

55:36.670 --> 55:37.543
There can be a fine line

55:37.545 --> 55:39.378
between deliberately
minimalist style

55:39.380 --> 55:42.840
and simple lack of technical
expertise or imagination,

55:42.842 --> 55:43.800
a problem the film

55:43.802 --> 55:46.012
- struggles with throughout.
- Okay.

55:47.472 --> 55:48.306
Thanks.

55:49.641 --> 55:50.474
I'm sorry.

55:51.851 --> 55:52.852
It's okay.

55:55.813 --> 55:56.646
Well, look, you can't take

55:56.648 --> 55:58.856
these things to heart, you know.

55:58.858 --> 56:00.360
And they can't all be bad.

56:01.860 --> 56:03.612
I'm gonna find another one here.

56:06.865 --> 56:08.240
Okay, okay, here we go.

56:08.242 --> 56:11.869
Mmm hmm.

56:11.871 --> 56:14.456
Mmm.

56:15.708 --> 56:16.542
Never mind.

56:18.795 --> 56:19.793
Really?

56:19.795 --> 56:20.629
Come on!

56:31.181 --> 56:32.307
Oh!

56:33.601 --> 56:36.396
This is why I don't read 'em.

56:44.862 --> 56:46.239
You know, if they

56:49.951 --> 56:52.579
knew what I went through
to make it,

56:54.329 --> 56:56.081
they'd understand, right?

56:57.208 --> 56:58.710
They don't care.

57:27.447 --> 57:28.573
Who was it about?

57:33.327 --> 57:34.161
The movie.

57:35.621 --> 57:37.746
It was about somebody,
wasn't it?

57:37.748 --> 57:38.581
I think it was.

57:38.583 --> 57:40.210
It was inspired by
a lot of people.

57:42.336 --> 57:43.545
But mostly...

57:45.965 --> 57:46.800
Yeah.

57:49.844 --> 57:51.094
Do you think she'll
see it?

57:51.096 --> 57:51.929
Oh God.

57:52.847 --> 57:53.679
Personally I'd be flattered

57:53.681 --> 57:55.307
if somebody made a
movie about me.

57:56.434 --> 57:57.641
Really?

57:57.643 --> 57:59.101
Yeah, I mean, you
know, it wouldn't make me

57:59.103 --> 58:00.311
fall in love with
them or anything,

58:00.313 --> 58:03.106
but it'd be a cool story
to tell my friends.

58:03.108 --> 58:04.398
God.

58:04.400 --> 58:05.818
Stop, thank you.

58:09.655 --> 58:13.659
I don't know, man, I really
liked her, loved, probably.

58:15.829 --> 58:18.707
I saw the end
before the beginning

58:21.458 --> 58:22.376
and I ruined it.

58:24.503 --> 58:25.336
Are you, look, I'm sorry.

58:25.338 --> 58:26.753
- I didn't mean for you...
- No, I, 'cause

58:26.755 --> 58:27.671
this is different.

58:27.673 --> 58:29.882
This is, this is kinda cool.

58:29.884 --> 58:32.260
You know, I mean, you gotta
try a little bit, though.

58:32.262 --> 58:34.052
You know, women like
to be pursued.

58:34.054 --> 58:36.932
Well, so do I, right?

58:38.101 --> 58:41.519
I'm a sensitive guy, you know.

58:41.521 --> 58:42.603
I cry a lot.

58:42.605 --> 58:45.231
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're a little bitch.

58:45.233 --> 58:46.067
Oh, you.

58:48.360 --> 58:51.822
You're gonna die
alone and miserable

58:52.782 --> 58:55.535
and probably just leaving 17
cats behind.

58:56.744 --> 58:57.911
Oh yeah, why is that?

58:58.829 --> 59:00.454
Because you're a
workaholic like I am.

59:00.456 --> 59:02.039
Hmm.

59:02.041 --> 59:03.585
And you're in
a failed marriage.

59:15.054 --> 59:17.306
You don't know anything
about my relationship.

59:22.394 --> 59:23.228
Sorry.

59:25.565 --> 59:26.398
Yeah, well.

59:29.943 --> 59:31.153
It's not untrue.

59:32.364 --> 59:33.865
God, only in love, Syd.

59:38.619 --> 59:41.413
Only in love

59:42.916 --> 59:46.753
do we actively decide

59:48.420 --> 59:49.254
to work

59:51.548 --> 59:56.554
in direct opposition
of good judgment

59:58.472 --> 59:59.766
and self-care.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:05.146
That is crazy and I do not
understand it.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:13.443
And that's, that is why
I write love stories

01:00:13.445 --> 01:00:18.115
'cause I am hoping that
I find a way

01:00:18.117 --> 01:00:20.077
to just figure this shit out.

01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:28.335
You know, I'm sure if she
sees your movie she'll love it.

01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:32.548
You still love her, don't you?

01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:39.304
No.

01:00:40.514 --> 01:00:45.478
No, um, I would not be
here in this bed with you

01:00:47.646 --> 01:00:48.479
if I did.

01:00:48.481 --> 01:00:50.525
I'm completely over it.

01:00:52.902 --> 01:00:54.110
You really
believe that?

01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:56.653
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:56.655 --> 01:00:57.782
There's no pressure.

01:00:58.824 --> 01:01:02.325
You can be in my
bed having loved

01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:04.412
or still loving someone else.

01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:05.248
It's fine.

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:07.916
I could love you, though.

01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:11.626
Don't say that.

01:01:11.628 --> 01:01:13.255
It's the truth, Sydney.

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:17.760
And don't think I'm crazy for
saying it.

01:01:19.887 --> 01:01:23.264
You mean, you could love me
one day

01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:25.268
or that you may already?

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:28.355
I might already love you

01:01:29.688 --> 01:01:31.023
and maybe I always did.

01:01:32.525 --> 01:01:36.193
Don't throw out
the word love like nothing.

01:01:36.195 --> 01:01:38.405
- Like every day...
- When I say it I mean it.

01:01:39.574 --> 01:01:41.699
Well, maybe you
just like saying it.

01:01:41.701 --> 01:01:43.119
Maybe it feels good to say.

01:01:43.952 --> 01:01:45.454
What are you doing up there?

01:01:47.164 --> 01:01:49.375
I'm stretching
my legs.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.505
Don't hit your head.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:57.423
Oh.

01:01:57.425 --> 01:01:58.590
No, it's fine.

01:01:58.592 --> 01:02:00.425
What did I
just say.

01:02:00.427 --> 01:02:01.302
I heard, I just

01:02:01.304 --> 01:02:02.135
- didn't listen.
- I just said.

01:02:02.137 --> 01:02:02.970
No, I got you.

01:02:02.972 --> 01:02:04.514
All right.

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:05.349
All right.

01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:13.900
Could you love me, Sydney?

01:02:16.152 --> 01:02:18.570
Like love me.

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:23.365
I don't know how to
answer that.

01:02:23.367 --> 01:02:24.201
It's simple.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:28.957
You just say how you feel.

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:32.083
Okay.

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:35.045
Um, I feel I could,

01:02:37.172 --> 01:02:39.425
I don't know, I don't know.

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:42.927
I haven't had a
lot of good relationships.

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:44.264
And me either.

01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:47.932
I mean Matt, you know, he's...

01:02:47.934 --> 01:02:49.266
What is...

01:02:49.268 --> 01:02:50.602
What's he like?

01:02:55.108 --> 01:02:56.276
He is tall.

01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:00.447
He's vain.

01:03:02.282 --> 01:03:03.615
He's closed off.

01:03:05.117 --> 01:03:07.577
And he always has dirt
under his fingernails.

01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:10.787
I don't know how that happens.

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:15.795
Um, he dreams big

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.922
and he works hard.

01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:21.634
And he bottles things up.

01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:25.804
But he's a good man.

01:03:26.931 --> 01:03:27.807
What does he do?

01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:32.144
He's a home equity
loan manager.

01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:33.980
Okay.

01:03:36.023 --> 01:03:38.358
He's not boring.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.026
He's funny, he's really funny.

01:03:41.028 --> 01:03:42.820
And I like that.

01:03:42.822 --> 01:03:44.074
It's complicated.

01:03:45.199 --> 01:03:48.450
You know, you're with someone
for so long

01:03:48.452 --> 01:03:50.704
and you just lose sight of...

01:03:52.664 --> 01:03:56.124
I was about to
finalize the divorce,

01:03:56.126 --> 01:03:57.670
but he wants to make it work.

01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:01.298
How 'bout you?

01:04:05.344 --> 01:04:09.347
We don't talk, you know,
I mean, not like this.

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:10.392
This is intimate.

01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:16.771
And his family, they're
pulling for us

01:04:16.773 --> 01:04:19.816
and my mom is and it's hard.

01:04:19.818 --> 01:04:21.818
You know, I mean, it's years of
my life

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.446
that I've spent
with this person.

01:04:25.614 --> 01:04:28.283
Well, about a year's my limit.

01:04:31.579 --> 01:04:33.039
I could do a year with you.

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.208
Mmm.

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:38.251
Oh, oh, oh.

01:04:38.253 --> 01:04:40.711
Oh, hello.

01:04:40.713 --> 01:04:44.715
Yes, just come on down, mmm hmm.

01:04:44.717 --> 01:04:45.717
Okay.

01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:46.552
Bye.

01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:48.552
Totally forgot about the food.

01:04:48.554 --> 01:04:49.388
Ah!

01:04:50.514 --> 01:04:51.430
All right.

01:04:51.432 --> 01:04:53.891
♪ Where oh where is underwear ♪

01:04:53.893 --> 01:04:57.061
Uh, are we breaking rule
number three?

01:04:57.063 --> 01:04:57.936
No.

01:04:57.938 --> 01:04:59.565
Okay, 'cause I think
the fuck not.

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:02.066
Here.

01:05:02.068 --> 01:05:03.860
Who the fuck
has a back scratcher?

01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:04.735
Me.

01:05:04.737 --> 01:05:06.614
You got orthopedic shoes too,
Grandma?

01:05:08.407 --> 01:05:09.240
Yep.

01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:11.367
Yeah, come in.

01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:12.784
Jesus, hold on,
Sydney, damn.

01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:14.789
Yep, come on in.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.461
Hello, can I
get some sheet, Sydney?

01:05:21.463 --> 01:05:22.295
Damn!

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:23.963
Hello?

01:05:23.965 --> 01:05:24.921
Would you take some?

01:05:24.923 --> 01:05:26.298
I thought you were
gonna put your pants on.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.508
- Well, I need you to do...
- One second.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:31.429
Got my ass and this motherfucker
about to, all right.

01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:32.889
Come on in.

01:05:32.891 --> 01:05:35.682
I'm not
really allowed

01:05:35.684 --> 01:05:36.726
to walk in your home.

01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:38.438
It's company policy.

01:05:39.438 --> 01:05:42.232
Well, could you just
throw the food down here?

01:05:45.402 --> 01:05:47.278
When you
pay for it.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.406
All right, incoming.

01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:51.533
Come on.

01:05:57.373 --> 01:06:01.460
You know, it's fine.

01:06:06.382 --> 01:06:07.215
Hey.

01:06:07.217 --> 01:06:08.383
Right.

01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:09.967
Hello.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:10.967
Sorry, but...

01:06:10.969 --> 01:06:11.802
Thank you.

01:06:11.804 --> 01:06:12.720
Sorry this is
so weird.

01:06:12.722 --> 01:06:13.640
Thank you.

01:06:23.608 --> 01:06:24.816
Tip?

01:06:24.818 --> 01:06:26.111
Yeah, sure, 15,

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.949
20, 30% is

01:06:32.992 --> 01:06:35.117
yeah, 30% because you, yeah.

01:06:35.119 --> 01:06:37.830
You know, actually, I do
need you to sign it, too.

01:06:39.164 --> 01:06:41.374
Couldn't you
just forge it or something?

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:43.878
You know what, I'm
just gonna come in there.

01:06:44.753 --> 01:06:45.920
Okay, thank you.

01:06:45.922 --> 01:06:46.755
Okay.

01:06:52.344 --> 01:06:55.095
Is there like a rat
or did your pet snake

01:06:55.097 --> 01:06:56.680
get loose or something?

01:06:56.682 --> 01:06:57.724
No.

01:06:57.726 --> 01:07:02.521
No, it's um, hot lava.

01:07:03.773 --> 01:07:04.604
What?

01:07:04.606 --> 01:07:05.690
Nothing, nothing.

01:07:07.152 --> 01:07:08.483
Forget it, it's fine.

01:07:08.485 --> 01:07:09.360
Okay.

01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:12.822
- Oh God!
- Hold, you're on it!

01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:13.655
I'm playing.

01:07:16.744 --> 01:07:17.578
That's funny.

01:07:19.246 --> 01:07:20.787
I'm so sorry.

01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:21.998
I'm really sorry.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.499
Oh, petty days
are here.

01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:26.043
Oh man, we've just,
it's been a long day.

01:07:26.045 --> 01:07:27.920
No, seriously, thanks
for playing along, bro.

01:07:27.922 --> 01:07:29.463
There's your card.

01:07:29.465 --> 01:07:30.548
Thank you.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.553
And if I could just
have you sign right here.

01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:35.762
Look at that, huh?

01:07:35.764 --> 01:07:37.679
Good bye paper receipts.

01:07:37.681 --> 01:07:38.514
Look at this.

01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:40.599
We got me signing
a whole tablet.

01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:41.934
Oh, technology's amazing.

01:07:41.936 --> 01:07:43.019
♪ The future is now ♪

01:07:43.021 --> 01:07:45.229
♪ The future is now ♪

01:07:45.231 --> 01:07:46.438
Watch some movies, watch some

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.066
- whatever he's watching.
- Just give it back to him.

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:48.900
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

01:07:48.902 --> 01:07:49.733
- I apologize.
- Thank you so much.

01:07:49.735 --> 01:07:50.735
I like technology, man.

01:07:50.737 --> 01:07:51.735
I'm a fan, bro.

01:07:51.737 --> 01:07:52.737
It's okay.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:53.820
Really appreciate it.

01:07:53.822 --> 01:07:54.738
Have fun.

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.572
Thank you.

01:07:55.574 --> 01:07:57.825
Enjoy whatever it is
you're doing.

01:07:57.827 --> 01:07:58.825
All right, bro.

01:07:58.827 --> 01:07:59.659
Okay.

01:07:59.661 --> 01:08:00.494
See you all right.

01:08:00.496 --> 01:08:01.954
Hey thanks for playing along,
bro.

01:08:01.956 --> 01:08:03.956
- You're a really good sport.
- Yeah.

01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:04.956
Ah.

01:08:06.126 --> 01:08:11.090
♪ I'm a-gettin' to have

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.437
What were your past
relationships like?

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:31.734
Some were good,
some were bad ones.

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:34.611
Well, did you
love them?

01:08:34.613 --> 01:08:36.115
Did you love them,
did you love 'em all?

01:08:37.617 --> 01:08:41.787
I think I did what I do
when I spend time with people.

01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:47.292
I give them everything I can.

01:08:49.627 --> 01:08:51.296
What made any of 'em special?

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:57.676
Mmm, the fact that we were

01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:59.846
in the same place, right?

01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:04.100
We wanted to be in
the same place,

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:06.563
connecting with each...

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:12.692
I don't know.

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:13.526
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:14.362
What?

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:18.865
You're not tired of me yet?

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:20.073
Oh, no, no, no.

01:09:20.076 --> 01:09:21.077
I wanna eat you.

01:09:22.118 --> 01:09:25.328
I wanna make a vest
out of your hair

01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:29.541
and drink your blood and
wear your skin as a dress.

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:33.670
Jack hammer me, Darrel,
jack hammer me.

01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:34.671
It's just so much.

01:09:34.673 --> 01:09:37.383
I'm not even sure what happened
to them.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.678
- Okay, all right.
- No, no, no.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.636
Okay.

01:09:41.639 --> 01:09:44.309
Did you ever jack
hammer what's her name?

01:09:46.685 --> 01:09:48.352
What is her name?

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:50.229
Sarah.

01:09:52.192 --> 01:09:53.734
Yeah, I think I did.

01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:57.986
You know it's best to
work up to the jack hammer.

01:09:57.988 --> 01:09:59.530
You don't wanna
lead off with it.

01:09:59.532 --> 01:10:02.575
Mmm, okay, well, the last
time we actually had sex

01:10:02.577 --> 01:10:07.037
it was bad, drunk sex.

01:10:07.039 --> 01:10:10.085
Mmm, that seems to be a
reoccurring thing with you.

01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:13.588
Ever go with threesome?

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:15.921
Yes.

01:10:15.923 --> 01:10:17.550
Two guys
or two girls?

01:10:19.511 --> 01:10:20.468
Both.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:21.554
Nice.

01:10:22.930 --> 01:10:24.054
What about you?

01:10:24.056 --> 01:10:27.183
Anything that three or
four people can do together

01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:29.020
I've pretty much done.

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:33.356
I mean, I got a strap-on
in my drawer down there.

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:37.151
Three different sized dildos
depending what you're into.

01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:38.863
If you wanted to
give that a shot.

01:10:41.573 --> 01:10:43.782
Light purple
and then dark purple

01:10:43.784 --> 01:10:46.702
and then my big one is green.

01:10:46.704 --> 01:10:50.373
Vibrating butt plug, cock rings.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.249
What the fuck?

01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:52.290
Flavored lube.

01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:53.209
What are you doing?

01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:54.376
I basically don't even need

01:10:54.378 --> 01:10:56.795
to watch porn anymore, you know.

01:10:56.797 --> 01:10:58.089
Anyway.

01:11:01.845 --> 01:11:03.885
So you're not watching
porn anymore at all, huh?

01:11:03.887 --> 01:11:05.890
No, I don't need to
watch porn.

01:11:07.016 --> 01:11:08.974
I've got enough right up here.

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:17.068
I have something honest to say.

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:26.368
I came to see you, that's
why I went to the premiere.

01:11:30.914 --> 01:11:34.875
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna go.

01:11:36.628 --> 01:11:38.131
To your own premiere?

01:11:39.798 --> 01:11:41.465
But the only reason
I went is 'cause

01:11:41.467 --> 01:11:45.055
I thought you might be there.

01:11:48.265 --> 01:11:49.768
I'd fantasize about you.

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:55.023
I'd be with Matt and I
would think about you.

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.650
I seem to think you like me.

01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:01.654
I'm so attracted to you.

01:12:02.529 --> 01:12:04.655
When I'm around you, I,

01:12:04.657 --> 01:12:08.576
all the cells in my
body wake up.

01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:11.286
I mean, they're aware, you know.

01:12:11.288 --> 01:12:14.833
My body loves your body.

01:12:16.252 --> 01:12:21.257
I fantasized about us
being right here like this.

01:12:24.344 --> 01:12:25.177
And I,

01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:30.305
well, meeting your family

01:12:30.307 --> 01:12:32.185
and your friends.

01:12:33.686 --> 01:12:38.358
And buying a house, getting
married, retirement,

01:12:40.734 --> 01:12:44.486
who would die first, all of it.

01:12:45.364 --> 01:12:47.199
Is that weird for me to say?

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:50.367
No, no, it's not weird.

01:12:50.369 --> 01:12:51.371
I did it too.

01:12:52.579 --> 01:12:55.289
I think the minute I really
start to like somebody

01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:59.378
I kind of imagine my whole
life with them, you know.

01:13:01.381 --> 01:13:03.173
I wonder if your mom
would like me.

01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:04.840
Are you serious?

01:13:04.842 --> 01:13:05.924
She'd love you.

01:13:11.599 --> 01:13:13.891
Do you think you can
love more than one person

01:13:13.893 --> 01:13:15.559
at the same time?

01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:16.395
Yes.

01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:20.233
Do you love her?

01:13:22.068 --> 01:13:22.902
No.

01:13:24.445 --> 01:13:25.947
How do you know?

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.683
What do you think our life
would be like together?

01:13:55.685 --> 01:13:56.558
Really?

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.937
Psst, I think it'd be something,
yeah.

01:13:59.939 --> 01:14:03.441
We both finally, you know, be
together,

01:14:03.443 --> 01:14:06.443
doing what we love to do.

01:14:06.445 --> 01:14:08.864
Just haven't had the
chance to do what you want.

01:14:11.326 --> 01:14:16.122
I think I think
if we were together,

01:14:17.998 --> 01:14:18.832
I'd hurt you.

01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:21.627
Maybe.

01:14:23.337 --> 01:14:24.463
Or maybe I'd hurt you.

01:14:27.384 --> 01:14:28.217
Yeah.

01:14:30.636 --> 01:14:32.639
I have a lot of baggage.

01:14:34.349 --> 01:14:36.059
I'm cold sometimes.

01:14:36.975 --> 01:14:38.811
Yeah,
I know.

01:14:42.314 --> 01:14:43.190
Sometimes I lie.

01:14:44.484 --> 01:14:47.278
But, you know,
I'm not right now.

01:14:49.613 --> 01:14:51.280
I'd know if you did.

01:14:54.618 --> 01:14:56.453
Hmm, I like this song.

Yes.

01:16:26.836 --> 01:16:28.794
Come on.

01:16:28.796 --> 01:16:30.796
You've got the urge and use all
of that.

01:16:30.798 --> 01:16:31.673
Okay, ah!

01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:32.592
Gimme some.

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:36.718
Do that back, aw.

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:40.224
Oh, oh!

01:16:48.774 --> 01:16:50.107
Yours probably
got it right here.

01:17:15.301 --> 01:17:17.759
We gotta go to Redondo Beach.

01:17:17.761 --> 01:17:19.012
Why?

01:17:19.014 --> 01:17:21.638
To visit my
friends Alisa and Kevin.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.723
Do we like Alisa and Kevin?

01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:24.143
Oh, we love them.

01:17:25.145 --> 01:17:27.147
All right, if you love 'em I
love 'em.

01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:32.400
You know, I was gonna
go to karaoke.

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:33.483
You know.

01:17:33.485 --> 01:17:35.111
Yeah, Alisa
would totally be down,

01:17:35.113 --> 01:17:37.280
but Kevin we may
need to get drunk,

01:17:38.115 --> 01:17:39.367
but I'm totally fine with that.

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:41.951
Hmm, be cool.

01:17:41.953 --> 01:17:43.455
Long as we stop by in and out.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.083
Hey, did you
remember to get your,

01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:50.295
your lady products?

01:17:52.546 --> 01:17:54.171
Uh, yeah, yeah, I packed 'em.

01:17:54.173 --> 01:17:55.089
Did you tell
'em that we need a ride

01:17:55.091 --> 01:17:56.092
to the airport?

01:18:01.472 --> 01:18:02.304
Yeah.

01:18:02.306 --> 01:18:03.724
All right, cool.

01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:07.811
So I don't have to wait
another 15 minutes for another.

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:12.567
You all right?

01:18:13.859 --> 01:18:14.692
Yeah.

01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:16.905
All right, cool.

01:18:21.368 --> 01:18:22.700
This is him.

01:18:22.702 --> 01:18:23.534
He's here.

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:24.369
- He's here?
- Yep.

01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:25.577
Want me go meet him?

01:18:25.579 --> 01:18:27.039
Uh, it'll be great.

01:18:28.207 --> 01:18:30.708
- Babe, come on, come on.
- Yeah, okay.

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.919
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.044
Gotta get a ticket, you gotta
do stuff.

01:18:34.046 --> 01:18:34.961
We're movin', we're movin'.

01:18:34.963 --> 01:18:36.254
We're making movies
that are amazing.

01:18:36.256 --> 01:18:37.091
Okay.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:46.182
- All right.
- Okay.

01:18:46.184 --> 01:18:47.016
We gotta go.

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:47.851
Yep.

01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:50.894
Come on.

01:18:50.896 --> 01:18:52.899
Okay, I will.

01:19:23.012 --> 01:19:23.844
- Hey there.
- How you doing?

01:19:23.846 --> 01:19:24.678
Are you Darrel?

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.763
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

01:19:25.765 --> 01:19:26.850
Thank you.

01:19:49.956 --> 01:19:52.205
I tried to give it a
little charge for you.

01:19:52.207 --> 01:19:54.959
Thank you so much.

01:19:54.961 --> 01:19:55.918
You guys seemed like

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.128
you were having a
good time last night.

01:19:57.130 --> 01:20:00.048
Well, you know, you gotta
live it up while you can, right?

01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.884
Yeah.

01:20:07.097 --> 01:20:07.931
Go, go.

01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:12.895
Oh, hmm, how was it?

01:20:16.983 --> 01:20:18.485
And I told her, you know,

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.818
maybe you should go
ahead and start packing.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.114
"No, no, no, I've got it,"
she said.

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:27.327
It's all good, though.

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:45.300
I'm gonna go check
on her real quick.

01:20:45.302 --> 01:20:46.136
Sure.

01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:48.053
I'll be right back.

01:20:48.055 --> 01:20:49.390
Okay.

01:20:56.355 --> 01:20:57.522
Hey, come on.

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:58.400
I can't go.

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:02.693
All right, well,
that's all right.

01:21:02.695 --> 01:21:03.527
We can stay here.

01:21:03.529 --> 01:21:05.362
Just let me go
cancel real quick.

01:21:05.364 --> 01:21:06.865
You can't do that either.

01:21:11.537 --> 01:21:12.413
I'm so sorry.

01:21:13.832 --> 01:21:14.871
I thought I could.

01:21:14.873 --> 01:21:16.208
I really thought I could.

01:21:23.757 --> 01:21:27.886
I'm moving to the east coast,
back home

01:21:30.681 --> 01:21:32.182
when this production wraps.

01:21:33.435 --> 01:21:34.561
We're gonna try again.

01:21:43.569 --> 01:21:45.697
You're not going to be
happy with him.

01:21:49.451 --> 01:21:52.494
You're not going to be
happy with him, Sydney.

01:21:56.707 --> 01:21:59.418
You can't, you can't even talk
to him.

01:22:02.005 --> 01:22:03.547
You can't talk to your husband.

01:22:07.426 --> 01:22:08.968
No, no, no, no, no.

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:11.970
No, it's, no, look.

01:22:11.972 --> 01:22:12.972
Look, the car...

01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:14.601
You didn't cancel your flight.

01:22:18.688 --> 01:22:19.939
No, no.

01:22:27.113 --> 01:22:30.490
Shit, this is not what
friends do to each other.

01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:38.705
We can't be friends,
Darrel,

01:22:38.707 --> 01:22:39.750
I mean, can we?

01:22:41.586 --> 01:22:42.420
Why?

01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:49.803
Because I could love you.

01:22:57.976 --> 01:23:00.479
Oh, this was a huge mistake.

01:23:03.149 --> 01:23:05.985
When we were in bed today,
you were thinking about her.

01:23:09.154 --> 01:23:09.988
Admit it.

01:23:18.622 --> 01:23:20.082
And I was thinking about him.

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:24.503
She emailed you.

01:23:26.463 --> 01:23:27.297
Hmm?

01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:30.969
You logged into your email on
my phone.

01:23:41.479 --> 01:23:43.314
She said she loved your film.

01:23:46.275 --> 01:23:47.442
I just saw the first sentence.

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:48.778
I didn't read the whole thing.

01:24:36.743 --> 01:24:39.913
Are you gonna make a
movie about this?

01:25:29.796 --> 01:25:32.465
Everything all right?

01:25:36.094 --> 01:25:39.264
We can um, we can
go to the airport.

01:25:42.559 --> 01:25:43.976
Okay.

01:26:24.016 --> 01:26:24.850
Hey.

01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:27.309
Yeah, I know it's late.

01:26:27.311 --> 01:26:30.105
I just wanted to get you
before you fell asleep.

01:26:33.734 --> 01:26:36.818
Listen, when I get home,

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.864
there's some stuff we need to
talk about.

01:26:40.074 --> 01:26:43.661
And I want us to be completely
honest with each other, okay?

01:26:46.413 --> 01:26:47.748
I love you, too.
