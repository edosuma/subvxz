00:01.235 --> 00:02.770
KARA: Previously,
on Supergirl...

00:02.803 --> 00:04.438
To new friends!

00:04.472 --> 00:07.275
The portal would help
your planet immensely

00:07.308 --> 00:09.643
and it would help me
get home to mine.

00:09.677 --> 00:13.514
Wait. Wait...
What are you...
What are you doing?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.683
RHEA: Thousands
of Daxamites survived

00:15.716 --> 00:17.785
the destruction of our planet.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.288
They just needed
a way to get here.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.423
-(J'ONN J'ONZZ GROANS)
-Turn it off!

00:22.456 --> 00:23.657
You're bringing
something here.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.059
You'll see.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.261
(BOTH GRUNT)

00:27.295 --> 00:28.296
(GRUNTS)

00:29.397 --> 00:30.398
SUPERGIRL: Lena!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.054
-Hello, Lena.
-(GASPS)

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
(VOICE SHAKING)
Where the hell am I?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.160
I've been
taking care of you

00:59.193 --> 01:02.330
ever since Supergirl nearly
killed you when she attacked
our portal.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.332
Supergirl tried to stop you.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.100
I should have stopped you.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.869
You lied to me and used me.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.206
I did what I had to do
for my people.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.108
But I did it for you, too.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.144
I meant what I said
on the ground.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.612
You are a marvel.

01:19.847 --> 01:23.684
And I know that you are meant
for bigger things,

01:23.717 --> 01:25.186
better things.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.621
This is a planet
of wasted potential,

01:27.655 --> 01:31.259
and you represent
the best of your race.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.462
I'm going to make a society
worthy of you.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.367
So get comfortable, Lena.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.670
You are where you belong,
beside me,

01:42.703 --> 01:48.709
presiding over this new world
that we will create together.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.449
(EXPLOSIONS)

01:57.718 --> 01:59.287
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

02:01.455 --> 02:04.358
People of Earth,
do not be afraid.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.295
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

02:08.862 --> 02:13.167
We have crossed a sea of stars
in order to bring you
a new way.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.170
A better way.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.375
I will be your Queen,

02:24.412 --> 02:26.414
and you will be my subjects.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.821
Obey our orders,
and we will protect you.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.689
-SAWYER: Danvers,
I'm at the police station!
-Do not resist.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.259
-Are you okay?
-They're everywhere, Alex.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.827
The Daxamite troops
are everywhere.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.563
I guess we have
transmat signatures
all across downtown.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.598
Our satellite systems
are crashed.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.734
-Danvers, I...
-Maggie?

02:48.336 --> 02:51.305
-They've attacked the NCPD.
-Is Maggie safe?

02:51.339 --> 02:52.773
What're we going to do?

02:53.674 --> 02:54.675
No!

03:01.715 --> 03:03.684
Everybody evacuate!

03:03.717 --> 03:04.718
Winn, go!

03:08.389 --> 03:10.491
Supergirl!
We're under attack.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.394
-I've evacuated the DEO.
-Hang on! I'm almost there.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.831
Whoa!

03:17.865 --> 03:20.701
-There's no time.
-All right.
I'll meet you outside.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.302
We need to get somewhere safe.

03:54.335 --> 03:58.439
Welcome to New Daxam.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.577
(DOOR OPENING)

04:04.978 --> 04:06.347
Leave us.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.820
How's the invasion
progressing?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.755
Is it as much fun
as you hoped?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.758
This planet has
amazing potential.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.860
It's gonna be beautiful
when we're finished with it.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.562
"Finished with it"?

04:21.595 --> 04:22.830
What are you planning to do?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.699
Build, of course.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.836
Monuments to our people,
to our way of life.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.639
Great pyramids like the ones
we had back home.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.674
And I suppose the humans
will build them for you.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.743
If they know
what's good for them.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.713
This ship is stocked
with Daxam's best.

04:39.747 --> 04:43.517
The leaders, the merchants,
the military strategists.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.786
Ah, the robbers, the liars,
the killers.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.590
The elite who once led
our people to greatness.

04:49.623 --> 04:55.596
Here, we can rebuild again,
and make way for the rest
of our ravaged population

04:55.629 --> 04:57.798
to settle once and for all.

04:57.831 --> 05:02.403
If you think that the people
of Earth will just lay down
and take this, you are wrong,

05:02.436 --> 05:05.906
because they are made
of stronger stuff
than you think.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.641
And besides,
Kara will stop you.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.779
Oh, I do not fear
the Kryptonian girl.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.382
What are you planning
to do with her?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.584
She's in your past, Mon-El.

05:16.617 --> 05:17.918
Focus on your future.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.019
What do you need me for?

05:19.052 --> 05:22.690
We must unite our people
with the people of Earth.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.592
You're the key.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.628
As you well know,

05:27.661 --> 05:30.564
on Daxam, the tradition is
for the regent

05:30.598 --> 05:33.033
to arrange a marriage
for their oldest child.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.037
Your father may be gone,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.673
but I think I've made
an excellent choice.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.974
Really?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.877
And who's the, uh...
Who's the lucky Earthling

05:43.911 --> 05:46.914
that won the "marry
an alien invader" sweepstakes?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.849
Lena Luthor.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.060
Do you know
what Rhea did to him?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.962
(SIGHS)
His vitals are erratic.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.665
You know,
it's like his neurons
are working overtime.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.968
He's comatose on the outside,
but on the inside...

06:08.001 --> 06:09.570
Will he wake up?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.705
WINN: Look who found us.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.006
-SUPERGIRL: James.
-Hey.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.576
-I'm so glad you're okay.
-Yeah, me, too.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.044
It's a war zone out there.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.846
The Daxamite troops are
beaming down from everywhere,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.415
setting up checkpoints,
arresting resisters.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.584
It's almost like
they're instituting
their own martial law.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.587
Yeah, well, not to mention
the full-on Independence Day
going out there

06:26.620 --> 06:29.022
with the mothership
hovering over the city.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.691
Mon-El is on that ship.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.461
Rhea took him
and she took Lena, too.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.695
Have you reached Clark yet?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.664
I called Perry White.
He's not at the Daily Planet,

06:36.697 --> 06:38.198
he's not at the
Fortress of Solitude, either.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.068
Maybe Superman's
out there right now,
fighting in the streets.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.470
If he is, I didn't see him.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.671
Maggie.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.108
I'm so glad you're okay.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.977
And I'm so glad that
when things look their worst,

06:50.010 --> 06:51.111
we both thought
to run straight to a bar.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.880
(BOTH LAUGH)

06:52.913 --> 06:54.482
SUPERGIRL:
We're all together.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.616
We can fight back.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.217
GUARDIAN: But where
do we start?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.152
Well, without
the DEO mainframe,
we're flying blind.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.922
Not to mention
the Daxamite military
patrolling the streets.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.525
And J'onn's not here
to lead us.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.093
Maybe I can be of service.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.829
(GUNS COCKING)

07:10.931 --> 07:12.099
What?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.601
Not happy to see me?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.808
You people
are so predictable.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.776
-ALEX: Hands above your head.
-No.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.144
You made a mistake
coming here.

07:24.177 --> 07:28.749
I find it as distasteful
as you do, Supergirl,
but I need your help.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.083
And you need mine.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.118
Where's my father?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.219
I don't know.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.721
That's the wrong answer.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.724
Well, it's the truth.

07:36.757 --> 07:40.661
SUPERGIRL: All right.
What do you want?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.262
To take down
our common enemy.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.499
Everything I warned against
has come to pass.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.902
The alien invaders have come
to destroy our way of life

07:48.936 --> 07:53.707
and claim our planet,
just as I said they would.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.242
You can just say,
"I told you so."

07:55.275 --> 07:57.177
I did tell you so.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.113
And now you can shoot me.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.784
Or we can work together.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.919
And we can save our loved ones
and this city.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.656
You mean your daughter that
you kidnapped and framed?

08:08.689 --> 08:09.990
SAWYER: We're going
to save this city.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.526
But we will never
work with you.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.627
That's right.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.963
We got this.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.833
Don't let your pride
get in the way
of your objective.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.703
That ship is armed
with Kryptonite cannons.

08:22.736 --> 08:27.040
You have no transmat portal,
and the Daxamites have
upgraded their shields.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.645
I need your help
to get onto that ship.

08:31.679 --> 08:35.649
Even if we wanted to,
like you said,
there's no way onboard.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.817
So sure about that?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.719
What are you saying?

08:38.752 --> 08:40.754
I'm asking you
to work with me.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.623
And we find Lena and Mon-El.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.957
Together, we can save them.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.026
You've said your piece.
Now leave.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.030
(SIGHS)

08:50.063 --> 08:52.733
You're making a mistake,
Agent Danvers.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.808
I understand why you all
don't trust me.

09:00.841 --> 09:05.212
But whatever happened
in our past, I'm asking you
to leave it there.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.881
The love I feel
for my daughter is real.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.918
Please, Kara.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.086
Help me save her.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.856
Get out.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.996
Call me
if you change your mind.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.104
I think Guardian and I should
get back out there,
see what we can do.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.306
-Okay, that's a good idea.
-Call us if you need us.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.342
(EXHALES)

09:37.144 --> 09:38.946
So how are we going
to do this ourselves?

09:41.281 --> 09:43.651
RHEA: Set up a blockade
and arrest any resisters.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.819
I don't want anyone getting in
or out of the city.

09:45.853 --> 09:49.289
-(DEVICE BEEPING)
-We're receiving
a communication from Earth.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.390
Put it up.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.759
Yes, my Lord.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.127
Rhea, Queen of Daxam,

09:54.161 --> 09:57.064
my name is
President Olivia Marsdin.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.999
You represent planet Earth?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.034
I represent the United States,

10:01.068 --> 10:03.671
but today I speak
for all humanity

10:03.704 --> 10:07.307
when I demand that you abandon
your siege of National City.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.243
Well, I'd be happy
to move my invasion force

10:10.277 --> 10:12.412
to Washington, D.C.,
if you prefer.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.148
Oh, I'm not in Washington.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.686
I'm heading straight for you.

10:18.719 --> 10:22.289
Uh, guys, I just picked up
on some sort
of live transmission

10:22.322 --> 10:23.657
from Air Force One.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.858
SUPERGIRL: Air Force One?

10:24.892 --> 10:26.226
Wait, don't tell me
the President

10:26.259 --> 10:28.328
is heading towards
the conflict and not away.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.764
Every time I think
I can't get happier
I voted for that woman...

10:30.798 --> 10:32.632
RHEA: National City is mine,

10:32.666 --> 10:37.204
and you should be thankful
that that is all I am
currently taking from you.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.808
The militaries of Earth
will unite against you.

10:40.841 --> 10:44.878
I am not afraid
of your trembling
little militaries.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.246
Stand down.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.948
"Stand down"?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.985
I think you are confusing
this situation

10:52.019 --> 10:56.156
with one in which you have
any sort
of negotiating leverage.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.860
This is not a negotiation,
this is a demand.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.228
You speak like that
to me again

11:01.261 --> 11:04.064
and you will feel
the consequences.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.366
CAT: Oh, my God, enough.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.768
All right, ladies!

11:07.801 --> 11:12.272
Ladies, if I wanted to listen
to this adolescent
macho-posturing,

11:12.305 --> 11:14.374
-I would have stayed in D.C.
-Ms. Grant?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.844
Is this really
who you want to be?

11:16.877 --> 11:21.181
Testosterone-driven windbags,
boasting about your big guns?

11:21.214 --> 11:24.952
Surely we don't need
to measure anything.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.486
We're women.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.389
We're tough, we're wise,
and we're way above
this pettiness.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.993
So let's just roll up
our sleeves and talk peace.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.962
I'm sorry, who are you?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.397
I'm Cat Grant.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.333
Known on Earth
as Queen of All Media.

11:40.367 --> 11:44.104
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Well, Cat Grant, I'm Rhea,

11:44.137 --> 11:46.239
and Earth now has a new Queen.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.707
Oh.

11:47.741 --> 11:52.012
Oh, well, let me just give
you a little bit
of friendly advice, Rhea.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.016
That tiara that you have
on the top of your head,
it's overkill.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.987
Real royals, they don't need
to try that hard.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.189
The thing is,
is that I have brokered peace

12:02.222 --> 12:04.491
between Kanye
and Taylor Swift,

12:04.524 --> 12:09.797
so I think mediating peace
between our two worlds
should be a piece of cake.

12:09.830 --> 12:14.167
And, the future is female,
we've all read the T-shirts.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.805
So we are three strong,
formidable women

12:17.838 --> 12:19.106
and we can do anything
we want.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.508
So let's just talk it out

12:21.541 --> 12:24.945
and come up with a harmonious
solution, shall we?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.216
Oh, my God.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.786
As I said before,
I am Queen now.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.023
I don't confab, I command.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.191
This conversation is over.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.226
(BEEPS)

12:47.267 --> 12:49.102
Madam President, this way!

13:09.156 --> 13:11.358
(SCREAMING)

13:22.903 --> 13:24.071
(FIRE CRACKLING)

13:31.578 --> 13:33.113
Oh, my God...

13:33.914 --> 13:35.082
The President!

13:35.115 --> 13:36.283
(METAL CREAKS)

13:42.455 --> 13:47.527
Uh, I suppose I owe you
an explanation.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.232
Well, at least tell me
you're still a Democrat.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.040
Madam President!
Thank God, you're alive.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.341
Remarkable, isn't it?

14:01.374 --> 14:03.010
Ms. Grant, you're alive, too.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.245
What did you think, Winslow?
My city is under siege.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.347
Do you think I would just
allow myself to die?

14:07.380 --> 14:10.083
I'm a little shaken up.
I could use a moment
to collect myself.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.885
-Is there a restroom
I could use?
-WINN: Oh, yeah.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.121
-Right around the corner.
-Okay, thank you.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.424
Supergirl, I understand you
setting up your rebel
headquarters in a dive bar.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.126
It's very French Resistance.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.261
But what are
all these monitors
and these satellites

14:21.294 --> 14:25.198
and these handsome,
armed men dressed in black?

14:25.232 --> 14:30.203
Well, um, Ms. Grant,
we work for a clandestine
government organization

14:30.237 --> 14:32.172
called the DEO.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.074
We're devoted
to protecting the planet
from extraterrestrial threats.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.609
Oh, I see. Well, you do
a bang-up job.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.478
Oh, yeah, Ms. Grant.

14:38.511 --> 14:42.082
Hi. Uh, Ms. Grant, how...
How did you get
on Air Force One?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.318
Oh, it was just kismet
that I happened to be in D.C.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.354
with the Dalai Lama
when the Daxamites invaded

14:47.387 --> 14:49.022
and I just hitched a ride
with Olivia.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.125
Olivia, as in, you know,
leader-of-
the-free-world Olivia.

14:52.159 --> 14:55.095
Yes, she was my RA
at Radcliffe,

14:55.128 --> 14:57.664
and I'm having
this vague memory

14:57.697 --> 15:00.200
of walking into
the dorm bathroom

15:00.233 --> 15:02.635
and seeing E.T.
in a bathrobe

15:02.669 --> 15:04.371
and I thought it was
the pot brownies,

15:04.404 --> 15:07.707
but now I'm realizing
that it was actually E.T.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.376
What are you saying exactly?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.945
I'm sorry,
did I not make myself clear?

15:11.979 --> 15:15.082
Our leader-of-the-free-world
Olivia is an alien.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.450
Okay, come on. The President
is not an alien...

15:17.484 --> 15:19.486
Oh, my God,
the President is an alien!

15:24.557 --> 15:25.558
(SIGHS)

15:25.592 --> 15:28.461
I assume that you are all
a little frightened,

15:28.495 --> 15:31.164
but I assure you,
I mean you no harm.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.134
Obviously. Otherwise I would
have been stabbed in the back

15:34.167 --> 15:38.371
by you that night at college
when your fiance
flung himself at me.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.407
Clearly, she's a pacifist.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.642
And darling, I love you
just the way you are,

I need to take this call,
sorry, I... It's, uh...

15:49.782 --> 15:51.718
Madeleine, hi!

15:51.751 --> 15:54.321
Well, yes,
of course I survived.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.290
Well, if I can survive dinner
with that letch,
Bill O'Reilly,

15:57.324 --> 16:00.293
I can certainly survive
a little turbulence.

16:00.327 --> 16:06.399
I was born on
this beautiful planet, Durla.

16:06.433 --> 16:11.771
And when the invaders came,
we hoped for the best
and we did nothing.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.508
Within a year,
they had enslaved my people.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.278
I was one of the few
to escape.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.981
Well, now I understand
why you're so supportive
of alien refugees.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.417
Yes.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.986
I would appreciate it
if you would all...

16:28.655 --> 16:30.257
Keep my secret.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.125
Your secret is safe with us.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.261
Mmm. Thank you.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.663
And J'onn J'onzz
is still injured,

16:36.696 --> 16:41.434
which makes you acting
Director of the DEO,
Agent Danvers.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.171
-Yes, Ma'am.
-You and your team
will break into the DEO

16:44.204 --> 16:48.041
and access the positron cannon
that is mounted to the roof.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.510
I'm sorry, we have
a positron cannon?

16:50.543 --> 16:53.546
Like a
vaporize-anything-it-shoots
positron cannon?

16:53.580 --> 16:58.718
You are to fire on and destroy
the Daxamite supership.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.820
SUPERGIRL:
There are civilians
on that ship.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.355
We have two friends
up there.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.157
The Daxamites shot down
Air Force One.

17:04.191 --> 17:09.062
Make no mistake,
they have the intent
to destroy us.

17:09.096 --> 17:13.333
The terrible lessons
I learned on Durla
will not be repeated.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.802
Destroy those ships.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.405
That is an order.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.579
RHEA: Ah, my son.

17:26.613 --> 17:31.151
The Prince, and his beautiful,
brilliant bride-to-be.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.586
Finally, all is right
with our worlds.

17:33.620 --> 17:38.425
I'm insane to even try to get
through to you, Mother,
but here goes.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.094
Lena and I are not
getting married.

17:41.128 --> 17:44.597
You can make this easy,
or you can make this hard.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.600
But there will be a wedding,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.536
and you will
produce an heir...

17:49.569 --> 17:51.504
Did you not hear us?

17:51.538 --> 17:54.341
We are not getting married
and we are certainly not
giving you an heir.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.509
She doesn't need us
for anything.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.879
She just needs
our genetic materials.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.882
Daxamites can generate a child
using just locks of hair.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.118
Which I collected
while you slept.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.588
My son knows me well.

18:08.621 --> 18:12.192
I hope for the best,
but prepare for the worst.

18:12.225 --> 18:17.564
So the wedding will legitimize
your union in the eyes
of the Daxamite people.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.466
We'll have
a formal ceremony.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.901
You're insane if you think
I'm going through this pageant
for you.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.904
Yes, you've made
your feelings for me
abundantly clear, Lena.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.440
I don't expect you
to do it for me.

18:27.474 --> 18:31.844
But there are people
you do care for.

18:31.878 --> 18:32.879
(DEVICE BEEPS)

18:35.415 --> 18:38.818
Wait... Wait, what is that?

18:40.353 --> 18:43.523
The Luthor Family
Children's Hospital,
of course.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.626
It's one of the things
I've always liked
about you, Lena,

18:46.659 --> 18:52.332
that you do more
with your money and power
than just live lavishly.

18:52.365 --> 18:56.135
You care about
the little people.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.677
The two of you will
get married,

19:04.711 --> 19:07.747
and after that you can spend
the rest of your days

19:07.780 --> 19:10.583
rotting in a cell
for all I care.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.885
The question is...

19:12.919 --> 19:17.557
Will you agree
to the ceremony now,

19:17.590 --> 19:23.663
or only after I've murdered
thousands of lives
in the city below?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.865
Because, after all,

19:25.898 --> 19:30.303
the Luthor's Children's
Hospital isn't the only
hospital in town.

19:31.904 --> 19:32.905
Fine.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.175
We will do as you ask.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.947
I know it's hard for you
to see now,

19:40.980 --> 19:44.251
but in time, you will realize
you made the right choice.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.967
Where's the President?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.504
escorted by two of our agents.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.606
Listen, if this plan
goes awry,

20:06.639 --> 20:08.275
she's gonna have
to lead the country...

20:08.308 --> 20:10.777
You're not actually thinking
of going through with this?

20:10.810 --> 20:13.280
-Mon-El and Lena
are still up there.
-I know.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.515
What would J'onn say?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.250
He would tell us to blow
up the ship.

20:17.684 --> 20:18.851
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:18.885 --> 20:20.520
At least
with the positron cannon,

20:20.553 --> 20:23.022
we have a chance to save
the people of National City.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.357
We don't have a choice.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.692
There's got to be another way.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.661
This is one time
you can't just fix this, Kara.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.530
Imagine if it was Maggie.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.632
I can.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.634
Which is why this is so hard.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.270
But we have orders.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.672
-I'm so sorry.
-I need to get some air.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.461
(SIGHS) I just came out
to look at the stars

21:01.494 --> 21:05.031
and to contemplate, but there
isn't much to look at tonight.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.602
Oh, and I didn't get a chance
to say it before,

21:09.636 --> 21:12.539
but thank you for saving me.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.707
(CHUCKLES) Of course.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.009
It's been nice having you
around again.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.779
So, who's up there?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.716
Oh, please. We both know
that Winslow is not capable

21:23.750 --> 21:25.318
of keeping his mouth shut.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.359
It's my boyfriend
and my best friend.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.464
Maybe the President
and Alex are right.

21:37.497 --> 21:41.468
Supergirl has a responsibility
to protect everyone.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.371
But all I think about
is the fact
that two people I love

21:44.404 --> 21:46.939
are trapped on that ship
and if we destroy it...

21:48.074 --> 21:50.677
Then they're destroyed, too,
and that...

21:59.085 --> 22:00.019

That's not selfish, Supergirl.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.023
That's human.

22:05.692 --> 22:06.893
Do you want to know
the real reason

22:06.926 --> 22:08.928
why I left National City?

22:09.829 --> 22:12.765
I wasn't happy.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.768
So I asked Siri,

22:15.802 --> 22:19.539
"Where is the happiest place
on Earth, Siri?"

22:19.572 --> 22:20.873
And she answered, "Bhutan."

22:20.907 --> 22:23.443
So, I booked my passage
to the Himalayas

22:23.476 --> 22:24.911
and moved into a yurt.

22:24.944 --> 22:28.781
Now, do you have any idea
what is in a yurt? Nothing.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.683
Nothing. Not even
central air conditioning.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.619
But these people,
they are happy.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.454
A child learns how to walk.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.424
They sing. A group of people
come down from a hike

22:37.457 --> 22:39.526
from the mountains
and they, they dance.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.861
And a couple, they go
on their first date

22:41.894 --> 22:44.130
and they throw
a damn festival!

22:44.997 --> 22:46.966
And all of a sudden,

22:46.999 --> 22:50.102
the secret to happiness
just dawned on me.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.474
It's human connection.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.443
And I could conquer
the world at CatCo,

22:56.476 --> 22:57.977
or I could twiddle my thumbs
in the yurt

22:58.010 --> 23:00.012
and the loneliness would feel
exactly the same,

23:00.046 --> 23:03.550
because I was missing
the point.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.819
It's not about what you do.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.056
It's about who you love.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.693
And there are two people
that you love

23:13.726 --> 23:16.095
trapped in an evil spaceship.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.831
Wanting to rescue them
is not selfish.

It's everything.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.040
Yeah.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.944

missed giving it.

with Cadmus?

-I know. But we need them.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.059
-We have to try.
-Time is wasting.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.096
-You said you have a plan?
-Yes.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.165

at the Fortress of Solitude...

24:26.198 --> 24:27.967
Breaking in,
stealing a deadly virus,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.570
and using it to kill aliens
in this very bar.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.505
He discovered
your cousin keeps

24:32.539 --> 24:35.274
a Phantom Zone
projector among
his Kryptonian artifacts.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.577
A projector?
That sounds kind of low-tech.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.211
They used it to beam
the prisoners

24:39.245 --> 24:41.781
instantaneously up
to Fort Rozz.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.950
-That is very high tech.
-HENSHAW: I can re-purpose it

24:43.983 --> 24:46.252
to beam us onboard
the Daxamite spacecraft.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.020
That's why we need your help.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.823
Give us access
to the projector
and we bring you aboard.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.124
That sounds
like a great plan.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.661
One that we can carry out
without you.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.895
Not quite.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.865
My cybernetic core
has been enhanced.

24:58.898 --> 25:02.068
I can interface
with the onboard
Daxamite computer system.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.636
We'll pass through undetected.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.704
Cool.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.006
Not cool.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.775
And when we're on board,
Alex can

25:08.808 --> 25:11.844
wrestle back control
of the positron cannon
at the DEO.

25:11.878 --> 25:15.181
It'll be a tight squeeze
to find Lena and Mon-El
before she fires.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.083
I suspect you're
up to the challenge.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.653
We need to get going.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.322
Listen, we're forgetting like
the biggest obstacle
of all here, Rhea.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.324
Right? I mean, she took
Mon-El and Lena for a reason.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.226
She's gonna be
watching them.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.795
She's gonna need
to be distracted

25:28.828 --> 25:31.263
if we're gonna go in there
and rescue these guys.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.332
We're gonna need
one hell of a distraction.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.202
I'm the queen of distraction.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.237
Ms. Grant,
this could be dangerous.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.306
No. No, no.
This will be dangerous.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.008
But if it's dangerous
for all of you,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.110
why shouldn't it be dangerous
for me?

25:44.143 --> 25:45.912
But I'll need Winslow.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.079
Me? Really?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.981
Well, I'm not taking
the robot.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.351
The Daxamites are powerful,

25:52.384 --> 25:54.754
but they're susceptible
to lead.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.824
A well-placed bullet
will take them out.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.959
We can do this.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.260
And now it's time to go.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.372
I'm not a fan
of the alien invaders,

26:13.405 --> 26:16.575
but I have to say,
they did nice work here.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.978
(GROANING)

26:19.011 --> 26:21.080
I thought we were
on the same team now!
What are you...

26:34.894 --> 26:36.062
Hey.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.867
What you said before
about Maggie, if, um...

26:40.900 --> 26:45.204
If she was on that ship...
You were right.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.874
I'd do anything that I could
to save her.

26:47.907 --> 26:50.142
So, you better hurry.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.678
-I will.
-If you are on board

26:51.711 --> 26:54.146
when I fire, you will not
survive that.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.248
-I know.
-Okay. So please...

26:56.282 --> 26:58.785
(SIGHS) Just be faster
than me.

26:58.818 --> 26:59.719
Okay? I know,

26:59.752 --> 27:01.353
I know you're fast,
but just be faster.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.358
Faster than a speeding bullet.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.860
(VOICE BREAKING) Okay.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.098
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

27:25.878 --> 27:27.446
Is this going to work?

27:27.479 --> 27:30.683
-Most likely.
-And if it doesn't?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.051
Then we'll all spend
a lot of time

27:32.084 --> 27:34.286
getting to know one another
in the Phantom Zone.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.422
Turn it on.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.094
I'm curious about something.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.896
You know my real identity.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.735
But you never told Lena.
Why is that?

27:48.768 --> 27:50.837
Eventually, she'll find
out on her own.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.740
Find out that you've been
lying to her all this time.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.242
And when she does?

27:57.243 --> 27:58.911
She'll hate you for it.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.813
(SCOFFS)

28:00.847 --> 28:03.115
Well, it's good to know
you're consistent.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.751
Oh, don't act so hurt.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.754
Right now our interests
are aligned,

28:07.787 --> 28:10.823
but when this is over,
we go back to being enemies.

28:10.857 --> 28:11.824
I look forward to it.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.826
-(ELECTRICITY SURGES)
-HENSHAW: It's ready.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.453
Yeah, I'm good.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.329
Please join hands.

29:00.172 --> 29:04.510
We come here today,
under the eyes of the gods,

29:04.543 --> 29:07.513
to seal a bond of marriage...

29:22.161 --> 29:24.163
-Oh, my God.
-I know, yeah.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.166
The damage is extensive.
There was this
little alien boy...

29:27.199 --> 29:28.835
No, not that!

29:28.868 --> 29:29.936
This.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.540
There are free weights
in my office.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.844
Yes. Uh, well, James...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.378
He believes the body
is a temple.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.448
And it smells like
a West Hollywood gym in here.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.984
And there are
sports paraphernalia

29:45.017 --> 29:47.553
where my Diptyque candles
are supposed to be.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.521
Uh, yeah, I will
make sure that

29:49.555 --> 29:52.091
James cleans all this stuff up
as soon as we, you know,

29:52.124 --> 29:53.325
save the world.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.127
Clearing up is not
gonna do the trick.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.596
I'm going to have to burn sage
for, like, a century.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.266
And where is James Olsen?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.568
This is the biggest story
in the history of the world,

30:02.601 --> 30:05.237
just the reason
I put him in charge.

30:05.271 --> 30:10.242
James is hiding,
like a coward.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.944
And Kara? Where is she?

30:11.978 --> 30:13.980
She's also a coward.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.447
Hmm.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.049
Uh, are you...
I'm almost finished.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.350
Are you, are you ready?

30:18.384 --> 30:20.019
Oh, Winslow.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.053
Yeah.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.554
I am always ready.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.324
(GRUNTS)

30:30.162 --> 30:32.564
PRESIDENT MARSDIN:
(OVER PHONE) Agent Danvers?
Requesting update.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.566
Roger. I have infiltrated
the HVAC system.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.068
Proceeding to command center.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.403
And Supergirl?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.371
Supergirl is dark out
of mission necessity.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.874
And I got a very trusted agent
on my six.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.311
We're almost there.
You good?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.246
So good.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.048
You know what I just realized?

30:49.081 --> 30:51.183
The first time we met was when
the President got attacked.

30:51.217 --> 30:54.921
Makes this kind of
a full circle thing for us.

30:54.954 --> 30:58.290
Though there are many stars
in our celestial kingdom,

30:58.324 --> 31:02.962
only one will lead you down
the correct path.

31:02.995 --> 31:06.098
Each of you have found
your star.

31:06.132 --> 31:09.368
And so, in my power
as acting regent

31:09.401 --> 31:12.404
of the Daxamite Empire,
it is my duty

31:13.139 --> 31:14.306
and my honor

31:14.340 --> 31:15.674
to proclaim you...

31:15.707 --> 31:17.509
CAT: (OVER TV)
Good evening, National City.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.011
It's Cat Grant.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.447
Yes, I've been away
for a while,

31:21.480 --> 31:23.282
but I'm back.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.517
Now, I can imagine that you're
feeling afraid,

31:25.551 --> 31:28.620
and feeling like your world
is spinning out of control.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.192
But, believe me,
you have power.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.095
And right now,
you have a job to do.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.397
Resist.

31:38.430 --> 31:43.235
Resist these invaders
with everything you've got.

31:43.269 --> 31:47.539
They come with empty promises
and closed fists.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.409
They promise to make
our world great again,

31:50.442 --> 31:54.046
and yet they know nothing
about the people who make
this world great.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.983
They think they can con us.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.151
And if that
doesn't work, what?

31:59.185 --> 32:02.621
They're going to beat
us into submission?

32:02.654 --> 32:05.457
They have no idea
who they're up against.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.159
Aliens and humans,

32:07.193 --> 32:10.262
we need to band together
and we need to stand up

32:10.296 --> 32:12.164
and fight back.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.433
Everyone needs to be
a superhero.

32:14.466 --> 32:18.570
Everyone needs to get up
and say, "Not in my house."

32:19.471 --> 32:21.707
Let's prove to these thugs

32:21.740 --> 32:24.710
that we are strong,
and we're united,

32:24.743 --> 32:27.579
and we are not
going to be conquered.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.182
And, Tiara Woman,

32:30.216 --> 32:34.053
if you and your little minions
happen to be listening,

32:34.086 --> 32:36.722
you have come
to the wrong town.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.690
Yeah.

32:38.724 --> 32:42.094
I'm Cat Grant.
Not going anywhere.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.063
Classic.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.335
Send a squadron
to the planet's surface
and kill that woman.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.569
Yes, my Lord.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.006
Take them to their chamber.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.123
(GRUNTING)

33:17.829 --> 33:20.132
It's a shame your politics
are so intractable.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.434
-You're very useful.
-My politics?

33:22.468 --> 33:25.404
I thought it was my alien
genetics that were
the problem.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.139
Just take the compliment.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.042
Do your thing, R2.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.048
(SCANNING)

33:39.351 --> 33:40.819
Any sign of them?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.654
There's only one other human
heat signature on this ship.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.057
-That's my girl.
-HENSHAW: I can lead us.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.159
And I can punch.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.261
Let's go.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.269
As your Prince,

33:57.303 --> 33:59.171
I order you to lay down
your weapons

33:59.205 --> 34:00.839
and let us go.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.675
Yeah, I didn't think that was
going to work either.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.611
(GRUNTS)

34:16.622 --> 34:17.823
Thank you.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.059
Yep, this way.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.616
Madam President, we're in.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.885
Excellent work, Agent Danvers.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.388
How long until
the cannon's ready?

34:49.421 --> 34:50.656
(EXHALES) Powering up now.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.192
We are watching closely,
Agent Danvers.

34:53.225 --> 34:56.462
We expect you
to fire when ready.

34:57.563 --> 34:58.764
Yes, ma'am.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.166
Over and out.

Come on, Kara.

-Break that.

Uh, Kara Danvers sent me
to get you.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.841
Yeah. She's great, isn't she?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.876
She'll be thrilled
to hear you think so.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.850
You came.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.919
With her.

to die. (SIGHS)

What did you do, Mother?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.443
Humans only, dear.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.910
Disable the projector.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.316
Danvers,
this is Lillian Luthor.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.852
We're clear of the supership
and safe.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.420

Turn it back on, Mother.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.267
I came for you.
Not them.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.302
Supergirl helped you.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.703
How could you betray her?

36:44.736 --> 36:47.539
I put everything on the line
to save you from them.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.276
Supergirl and Mon-El
are still aliens

36:50.309 --> 36:52.311
and they'll die
with their own kind.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.915
I thought you'd
finally see my side.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.550
Well, now what are
we gonna do?

36:58.584 --> 37:01.019
Lillian betraying us wasn't
the biggest shock ever.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.921
So, Winn bugged Henshaw

37:02.954 --> 37:04.456
and rigged a remote
so I could beam us back

37:04.490 --> 37:06.925
if she double-crossed us.
Hope for the best...

37:06.958 --> 37:08.994
Have Winn Schott prepare
for the worst.

still blinds you to the truth.

without you.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.284
Rhea's already lost.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.986
The positron cannon is ready
to fire, and you're safe.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.055
Your mother deserves
to surrender gracefully.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.925
Please, don't do this.
You're not gonna get through
to her.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.560
I have to try.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.896
As long as you're safe.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.413
(BEEPS)

38:06.518 --> 38:08.887
Ms. Grant, that was
incredible. (CHUCKLES)

38:08.920 --> 38:11.923
And that was
a pretty nifty trick...

38:11.957 --> 38:14.059
WINN: Whoa! Go, go, go.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.363
Elevator, elevator.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.632
This way, this way, this way.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.368
(WINN EXCLAIMS)

38:22.401 --> 38:24.536
Okay, well, it was
nice knowing you.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.674
Yes. Go, go, go.
Come on.

38:30.776 --> 38:31.943
Bring it.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.746
(AIR HISSING)

38:34.780 --> 38:36.081
(COUGHING)

38:39.951 --> 38:41.887
Lead dust.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.555
Let's make this
a fair fight.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.759
Space asthma.
It's my idea.

38:47.793 --> 38:48.994
It's a good idea.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.478
(WINN CHUCKLES)

39:09.781 --> 39:10.982
You're safe now, Ms. Grant.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.484
Thanks, James.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.586
I'm Guardian.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.588
Oh, honey.

39:16.622 --> 39:19.558
I can see your eyes
right through the slit.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.061
(STAMMERS)

39:24.796 --> 39:27.433
-Where's Supergirl?
-She's not coming.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.935
Alex? Alex, it's Mon-El.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.570
Lena and I are fine.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.672
Winn's device worked.
But Supergirl stayed up there.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.841
PRESIDENT MARSDIN:
Your time is up,
Agent Danvers.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.176
The positron cannon
is ready to fire.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.611
You need to use it.

39:39.645 --> 39:40.779
MON-EL: Alex, do you read?

39:40.812 --> 39:42.013
Supergirl stayed up there!

39:42.047 --> 39:43.882
Madam President,
I need more time.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.084
You have your orders.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.819
Now complete your mission.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.830
It's over, Rhea.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.534
I came back to give you
one last chance

40:02.568 --> 40:04.102
to do the right thing.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.972
How generous of you.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.140
When I was a child,
I could look up into the skies

40:09.174 --> 40:11.076
and see Daxam and the stars.

40:12.811 --> 40:16.615
I was told so many times
how terrible a place it was,

40:16.648 --> 40:18.517
but I couldn't
understand that.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.988
Because they had families,
like us.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.656
People they loved.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.993
In a few minutes,
this ship will be destroyed,

40:28.026 --> 40:29.561
and everyone on it.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.130
You don't want that.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.833
Save your people
while you still have time.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.503
Touching speech, Supergirl.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.773
Sadly, wasted
on the wrong audience.

40:43.609 --> 40:47.679
When my own husband
opposed me, I killed him.

40:47.713 --> 40:50.882
You really think you can tug
at my heartstrings?

40:54.085 --> 40:57.222
You were right
about one thing though.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.891
It is over.
For you.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.763
(PULSATING)

41:17.008 --> 41:18.009
It's gone...

41:18.043 --> 41:19.945
The positron cannon is gone.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.781
(GASPS)

41:26.117 --> 41:27.919
Supergirl.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.527
You really thought you'd won.

41:35.961 --> 41:36.995
Didn't you?

41:39.898 --> 41:40.899
(GROANS)

41:42.233 --> 41:43.802
(GROANING)

41:48.339 --> 41:49.641
Superman?
