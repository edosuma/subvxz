Yes, but not from grandparents.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.558
When it's your own child,
absolutely.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.560
Discipline and order is the way.

09:55.695 --> 09:59.163

on recklessness and fun.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.633

the truck plays that song

10:16.450 --> 10:17.648

- Hi.

It's really nice to meet you.

10:41.708 --> 10:42.707
Nice to meet you, too.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.443

10:45.479 --> 10:48.579

hundred lies I told khia.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.081

I mean, is afraid the right--

10:56.056 --> 10:57.322
Oh, it's definitely fear.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.624
Crippling, unwavering fear.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.359
And you passed it
on to your daughter.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.961

hard conversations.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.366
Didn't you just ghost your ex
and then fly halfway across

11:08.368 --> 11:10.435

have to break up with her.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.080
That's going to
be a conversation.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.514
She was complaining
she hadn't seen me,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.150
And I kept saying
I was going to come visit,

13:05.285 --> 13:07.751
And then one night
I'm doing a show in winnipeg,

13:07.788 --> 13:10.288
And guess whose laugh I hear?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.623
Santa!

13:12.659 --> 13:14.425
Mom.
My mom was in the front row.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.760
She'd never let anything
get in the way of seeing me.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.229
Aww.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.430
We always take it
for granted, don't we?

13:19.499 --> 13:20.765
Mm-hm.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.466
Candy saw my set, too. Loved it.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.535
I did a bit about capri pants.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.771
I miss her. She was the best.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.974
Yeah, this must be hard on you,
too, finding out today.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.910

13:32.045 --> 13:34.846

13:34.848 --> 13:37.114
I just wish
I got to say goodbye.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.817
Wait, what if we did a ceremony?

13:39.853 --> 13:42.253
For us, everyone on the block.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.255
Yeah! That's a great idea.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.123
Especially with you here.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.858
We could have it
on the island tomorrow.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.327
We could set up the microphone
so anyone who wants

13:49.396 --> 13:51.262
Could say a few words.
You could do a set.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.131
I mean, we could name
the island after her.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.000

I'll paint a tribute.

not in front of strangers.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.162
Oh, we're not strangers.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.897
Not anymore.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.433
I can't go in that house.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.900
She's lived here for 10 years.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.702
How is this the first
time I'm visiting?

14:31.738 --> 14:34.005
I promise you she understood.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.107
You were following your dreams.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.375

14:37.444 --> 14:39.576
She couldn't stop
talking about you.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.112
I haven't done
a set since she died.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.514
I can't go on stage.
It just doesn't feel right.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.384

this trip would help,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.619

14:56.696 --> 14:58.129
20 years ago.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.798
20 years? 20.

As much as I did,
and as much as I do.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.133
And I know that, uh, you know,
she's looking right now

19:29.268 --> 19:32.803
And she's laughing.
(chuckling)

19:32.839 --> 19:35.473
And, uh, again,
I'm not just saying that,

19:35.475 --> 19:37.675
'cause, you know,
she loved to laugh.

19:37.677 --> 19:41.145
Um, I actually think
she's laughing at me.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.247
(all laughing)

19:43.249 --> 19:46.484
Uh, because for years, you know,
she told me to pick up my toys

19:46.619 --> 19:48.119
And pick up my books
and clean my room,

19:48.254 --> 19:52.690
And then she went and left me
a gigantic clutter box.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.759
(all laughing)

19:54.761 --> 19:56.159
There are so many shoes.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.029
So many shoes in that house,

19:59.065 --> 20:01.632
And it baffles me because,
I mean,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.301
Mom, you only had two feet.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.837
(all laughing, clapping)

20:06.906 --> 20:08.306
I didn't open up the garage yet.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.674
God knows there's a whole
payless in there.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.575
(crowd laughing)

20:11.577 --> 20:13.511
I think I'm going to hang out
with my dad at his place more.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.981
I think he'd love that.

20:17.050 --> 20:20.117
Francis: One of my feet actually
is the same size as hers.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.752
The other one of my feet
I got from my dad, so.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.787
(crowd laughing)

20:23.856 --> 20:25.723
(sighing) I just wish
we had the same size feet.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.225
(crowd laughing)

20:28.228 --> 20:30.661
To what do I owe the pleasure?

20:30.796 --> 20:31.929
No reason.
