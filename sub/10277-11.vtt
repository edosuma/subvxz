00:04.942 --> 00:05.985
Previously on E.R

00:06.020 --> 00:07.283
Hi, I'm Jing-Mei Chen.

00:07.284 --> 00:11.377
Dr Chen, as a rule, we don't lie
about our patients' medical conditions.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.950
I cannot thank you enough, Dr. Knight.

00:14.251 --> 00:15.912
I'm not a Dr yet.

00:15.913 --> 00:17.475
You are to me.

00:17.676 --> 00:20.872
Mr. Rollins, this is Lindsey Cordova.

00:20.873 --> 00:22.216
So, how can I help you?

00:22.217 --> 00:23.652
I want to bury my sister.

00:24.621 --> 00:26.367
Where is she Dean?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.138
How are you holding up?

00:28.139 --> 00:30.850
In all honesty I'm exhausted.

00:30.851 --> 00:32.500
Maybe you should come live with me in Chicago.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.074
Chicago.

00:35.883 --> 00:38.849
6x11 "THE DOMINO HEART"

00:39.256 --> 00:42.422
...snow in the southern plains
and rain in Texas...

00:42.635 --> 00:45.884
...going northeast.
You see the trough here.

00:46.054 --> 00:50.929
That's allowing cold air in.
The moisture mixing with snows...

00:51.142 --> 00:54.593
...in Kansas.
But this low that's moving...

00:54.812 --> 00:57.897
- ...will pull up some Gulf of-
- Dad?

00:58.066 --> 01:03.024
Hey, Mark. You' re up early.
Might snow later. Fifty percent chance.

01:03.237 --> 01:06.902
- It's a little loud.
- You ought to have a bedroom door.

01:07.074 --> 01:09.197
- No, thanks.
- I can build you one.

01:09.410 --> 01:12.908
I don't want a door.
Can you turn that thing down?

01:13.579 --> 01:16.616
Hello? Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:16.833 --> 01:22.172
My dad's visiting. Yeah.
It won't happen again.

01:22.422 --> 01:26.040
- Who's calling at this hour?
- You woke my neighbor too.

01:26.259 --> 01:29.758
No wonder. The walls in
this building are paper-thin.

01:30.596 --> 01:34.095
- By the way, we're out of coffee.
- So I see.

01:34.267 --> 01:38.394
There was only a little left.
Barely able to get any myself.

01:38.603 --> 01:40.346
I'll just go to work.

01:40.563 --> 01:43.315
- This early?
- Yeah. This early.

01:43.525 --> 01:47.819
I like that weather channel.
No sense in watching it in San Diego.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.318
"Clear and sunny."

01:50.532 --> 01:53.402
"Chance of a cloud. Mostly sunny."

01:55.870 --> 01:59.618
- Hey, Chuny.
- Welcome back! How are the twins?

01:59.831 --> 02:03.580
They're great. This is my first
whole day without them.

02:03.794 --> 02:07.044
- It seems pretty quiet, though.
- Actually, no.

02:07.256 --> 02:08.880
- Back to work.
- See you.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.882
I'm right behind you.

02:11.050 --> 02:15.049
Vito Camporsero, 29, acrobat.
He slipped off the trapeze.

02:15.264 --> 02:17.836
- How far did he fall?
- About five feet.

02:18.057 --> 02:20.134
His armpit caught on the cable.

02:20.352 --> 02:22.059
It's not so bad.

02:23.146 --> 02:25.054
- Carol, welcome back.
- Thanks.

02:25.230 --> 02:30.391
Deep laceration to the left axilla,
three-liter blood loss. BP's 60 palp.

02:30.611 --> 02:33.647
Okay, ready, steady, lift.

02:34.239 --> 02:35.567
Four units of O-neg.

02:35.741 --> 02:38.314
- Are you the new nurse?
- Good to be back.

02:38.744 --> 02:41.661
- I need a pulse ox probe.
- A gram of Ancef.

02:41.872 --> 02:43.745
No water. Anybody know why?

02:43.915 --> 02:45.409
- No.
- I just got on.

02:45.584 --> 02:48.917
- I'll check it out. Are you all right?
- All set, thanks.

02:49.253 --> 02:52.919
Pressure is crashing.
Carol, prep for a subclavian.

02:53.508 --> 02:55.915
- Are you hurt?
- It's Vito's blood.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.756
Dominic carried him down the ladder.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.966
- Pulse is 124.
- Carol, the Betadine.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.926
Oh, yeah. I got it.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.475
- It's okay if you're rusty.
- I'm fine.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.806
I didn't know the circus was in town.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.811
Laceration of the axillary artery.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.518
- I'm Dr. Romano.
- Hello.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.976
Help my brother.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.070
Check the crits first.

03:19.282 --> 03:23.065
Okay. Absent wrist pulses.
Let's have a look.

03:24.202 --> 03:26.326
- Easy, easy!
- You're hurting him!

03:26.538 --> 03:28.117
Give him morphine!

03:28.541 --> 03:31.578
- Stop it, please.
- Almost done. Hold on.

03:33.629 --> 03:37.128
- Step back a little bit!
- Get these guys out of here!

03:37.300 --> 03:40.086
Okay. Okay. Stop, please.

03:41.886 --> 03:42.917
Kovac?

03:43.137 --> 03:47.764
What the hell are you doing?
Let go of me! Hey, call Security!

03:47.975 --> 03:49.552
Get your hands off me!

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.400 --> 04:42.772
- Put four liters at every sink.
- What's up?

04:42.944 --> 04:46.527
Water main broke.
Could be a while before they fix it.

04:46.823 --> 04:49.741
- You're not on.
- Valerie Page called me.

04:50.202 --> 04:54.281
- The girl you ordered L-VAD for?
- They found a transplant match.

04:54.496 --> 04:55.991
That is great.

04:56.207 --> 05:00.251
- They're stacked in Chairs.
- I'm on the code team today.

05:00.419 --> 05:04.915
I was paged for a respiratory
arrest that was a false alarm.

05:05.131 --> 05:06.210
What's up?

05:06.424 --> 05:09.211
Your dysentery patient
used the toilet.

05:09.427 --> 05:11.586
- So?
- No water? We can't flush.

05:11.805 --> 05:14.759
Oh! Well, sorry. I got another case.

05:14.933 --> 05:17.803
Put the "Out of Order" sign up.
Call Housekeeping.

05:18.019 --> 05:21.186
Amira, can we get portable toilets...

05:21.398 --> 05:23.769
...and maybe some air freshener?

05:24.150 --> 05:27.768
- You get many accidents in the circus?
- No. Not usually.

05:27.987 --> 05:31.521
Peng is afraid she won't be able
to perform tonight.

05:31.740 --> 05:36.366
No, no. The laceration is not bad.
Tell her she'll be fine.

05:38.497 --> 05:40.074
Thank you.

05:40.291 --> 05:41.619
How did this happen?

05:41.792 --> 05:46.536
One of the platforms broke. A piece
of wood fell right on top of her.

05:46.755 --> 05:51.131
Yes, but if the wood fell from above,
how did it...

05:51.342 --> 05:53.501
...hit the bottom of her foot?

06:06.816 --> 06:09.388
- Like this. You see?
- Wow!

06:10.193 --> 06:13.397
I think I'll go see
this circus of yours.

06:13.613 --> 06:15.238
There's one of them.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.900
Get him out of here.

06:19.619 --> 06:22.405
My mother's had Parkinson's
for 15 years.

06:22.579 --> 06:24.904
Has her condition changed?

06:25.081 --> 06:28.748
The past couple of days,
she's been so weak.

06:28.961 --> 06:31.368
I'm worried she had a stroke.

06:33.382 --> 06:37.593
- Oh, no. Let us help.
- No, I don't mind. I do it every day.

06:37.802 --> 06:41.882
Good for my health. Right, Mom?

06:42.098 --> 06:44.635
To tell you the truth, I'm a burden.

06:44.850 --> 06:49.311
Louise has to lift me onto the toilet
and sponge bathe me.

06:49.521 --> 06:52.226
Oh, come on, Mom. Stop it.

06:52.441 --> 06:56.688
She gets dizzy when she sits up.
Could it be her heart?

06:56.904 --> 06:58.862
Well, we'll check.

06:59.073 --> 07:03.983
- Maybe the Parkinson's is worse?
- Well, I don't feel worse.

07:04.202 --> 07:08.496
Well, you might not. But I'll
examine you, run some tests...

07:08.706 --> 07:10.746
...and find out what's going on.

07:12.252 --> 07:13.283
You okay?

07:13.544 --> 07:16.117
Oh, yeah. Fine.

07:16.755 --> 07:17.787
Okay...

07:18.007 --> 07:20.961
We got an IV cefotaxime order
for Exam Two.

07:21.135 --> 07:23.127
- Okay.
- It's been in the rack.

07:23.345 --> 07:26.097
I just checked the rack.

07:26.307 --> 07:29.093
- Lady's got pneumonia.
- This man has chest pain.

07:29.309 --> 07:33.010
I only do one thing at a time.
I'm moving as fast as I can.

07:33.230 --> 07:35.518
I know. It's your first day back.

07:35.732 --> 07:38.603
I know you've gotta get back
into the flow.

07:38.818 --> 07:42.897
I don't think any
of my patients have suffered.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.023
I didn't mean to imply that.

07:45.241 --> 07:49.285
Why wasn't I paged
for the water crisis? We have a plan.

07:49.495 --> 07:51.571
I'm on the committee.

07:51.789 --> 07:54.825
There's no crisis.
We got portable toilets.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.711
We got bottled water.
It's under control.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.502
Except that the O.R. can't
sterilize the instruments.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.209
We're closed to trauma.

08:03.425 --> 08:04.587
That sounds good.

08:04.801 --> 08:08.668
If the patients can't make it out
or they don't want to freeze...

08:08.888 --> 08:11.379
...we can use
the physical therapy pool.

08:11.599 --> 08:14.683
A two-gallon dump
gives you a solid flush.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.351
Thanks for the information.

08:17.522 --> 08:19.348
- Sure.
- That's good to know.

08:19.649 --> 08:21.605
- Hi!
- Hi.

08:22.485 --> 08:25.485
I was about to eat
when my pager went off.

08:25.696 --> 08:28.697
I just about jumped out of my seat.

08:28.866 --> 08:32.150
This is news worth
missing breakfast for.

08:32.368 --> 08:35.868
- I forgot my slippers.
- You'll get some with your new heart!

08:37.289 --> 08:39.995
- Keeping up, Carol?
- Oh, God.

08:40.210 --> 08:44.042
- Seen the records on my patient?
- File room's bringing them.

08:44.214 --> 08:46.704
- Did you fax his EKG to his PMD?
- Yes.

08:46.882 --> 08:50.002
- He said he'd call.
- Maybe he's busy.

08:50.803 --> 08:55.132
Here's the problem. Paper jam.
Fax it again, will you, Carol?

08:55.349 --> 08:59.642
- Anyone seen the x-rays on that ankle?
- Don't hold your breath.

08:59.852 --> 09:04.100
Radiology can't process
the film without water.

09:04.316 --> 09:07.732
We might be able
to grab something to eat.

09:07.903 --> 09:09.729
Sounds like fun.

09:10.071 --> 09:13.404
- Yeah?
- Have a good time.

09:16.327 --> 09:20.574
Michael Mueller. Had a seizure
while driving, crashed into a wall.

09:20.748 --> 09:23.120
He's post-ictal, tachy at 120.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.833
We were going to play hockey
and he started to shake.

09:27.045 --> 09:30.165
Curt Obarr, passenger.
He has a forehead lac.

09:30.382 --> 09:33.003
- Has he ever had seizures?
- Not that I know of.

09:33.219 --> 09:38.508
Okay, everybody, nice and easy.
On my count. One, two, three.

09:38.723 --> 09:43.432
- Get a C-spine, chest, and head CT.
- They can't develop x-rays.

09:43.603 --> 09:48.941
- All right. Let's get the fluoroscan.
- Sinus tach, 130. BP's 124 over 78.

09:49.149 --> 09:52.315
Pupils are equal.
Does he have medical problems?

09:52.528 --> 09:54.769
He uses an asthma inhaler.

09:54.988 --> 09:58.404
- Old bruises. Play rough?
- He got hit bad last week.

09:58.617 --> 10:00.277
- Did he hit his head?
- No.

10:00.619 --> 10:02.695
Temp's normal, 98.8.

10:03.413 --> 10:05.370
Whoa! Let's roll him!

10:06.416 --> 10:08.954
- Add a theophylline level.
- What's that?

10:09.127 --> 10:12.460
Asthma medication.
Take too much, this can happen.

10:15.466 --> 10:19.049
Louise? Hey. Everything looks okay.

10:19.261 --> 10:23.757
Head CT, EKG and the blood tests
are all essentially normal.

10:24.099 --> 10:26.223
Then why can't she walk?

10:26.435 --> 10:28.427
It's probably the Parkinson's.

10:28.645 --> 10:32.975
But her neurologist can adjust
her medication as an outpatient.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.233
Could we talk outside?

10:38.613 --> 10:40.985
Yeah, sure. Of course.

10:42.825 --> 10:48.164
- Then you're not going to admit her?
- Not when there's no reason to.

10:49.790 --> 10:54.119
I love my mother. But I can't
take her home and care for her...

10:54.336 --> 10:57.503
...when she can't walk.
I'm just too exhausted.

10:57.673 --> 11:02.001
- Well, maybe you need a home aide.
- I can't afford a home aide.

11:02.802 --> 11:05.969
She needs to be in the hospital
for a few days...

11:06.180 --> 11:11.175
- ...so you can adjust her meds.
- We can't admit her for that.

11:11.352 --> 11:14.104
I'm asking you, please.

11:14.314 --> 11:17.480
I'm just so tired right now.

11:17.775 --> 11:21.025
It's been such a difficult few weeks.

11:21.236 --> 11:24.819
If she could just stay
for a couple of days...

11:27.200 --> 11:29.358
Well, I wish I could help you.

11:29.535 --> 11:34.197
But the hospital doesn't allow that.
I'm really sorry.

11:38.961 --> 11:40.041
Okay, thanks.

11:42.048 --> 11:43.507
These are...

11:43.717 --> 11:46.800
- "Ridiculous" would be one word.
- Yes.

11:47.011 --> 11:50.214
- Best the gift shop had to offer.
- Thank you.

11:50.389 --> 11:54.801
You're welcome. I called your mom.
She is on her way here.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.592
- And your dad is-
- Not around.

11:57.771 --> 11:58.802
I know the story.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.848
- Hello.
- Dr. Weaver.

12:01.065 --> 12:04.932
- Valerie, how are you?
- The proverbial "couldn't be better."

12:05.152 --> 12:08.688
- Good. Lucy, do you have a minute?
- Sure. Excuse us.

12:08.907 --> 12:10.449
We'll be right back.

12:12.785 --> 12:17.363
I've looked over the chart.
And Valerie has a fever.

12:17.581 --> 12:21.413
- Her temperature is 100.9.
- That could just be a cold.

12:21.585 --> 12:26.923
She needs immunosuppressive agents
so she won't reject the new heart.

12:27.131 --> 12:31.593
- Even a cold could be fatal.
- What are you saying?

12:31.762 --> 12:36.756
Notify the transplant coordinator.
We may have to decline the heart.

12:38.393 --> 12:40.966
Is there anything we can do?

12:41.646 --> 12:46.603
It'll be their decision.
But I think that's what will happen.

12:47.318 --> 12:50.022
I can't believe this.
She was so close.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.439
- Want me to tell her?
- No. No, I'll tell her.

13:05.293 --> 13:07.085
Shooting.

13:07.629 --> 13:12.254
Yeah, definitely got a fracture
on your hand just below the pinky.

13:12.466 --> 13:15.550
You can move it back.
It's gonna need a cast.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.168
I'm lucky. It could've been worse.

13:18.388 --> 13:20.962
- How's Curt?
- Oh, he's fine.

13:21.141 --> 13:23.597
His forehead's being sutured up.

13:26.605 --> 13:30.139
- I'm more concerned about you.
- I feel fine.

13:30.317 --> 13:33.650
Your seizure was caused
by an overdose.

13:33.820 --> 13:38.564
- An overdose?
- Were you trying to hurt yourself?

13:38.782 --> 13:44.025
No. My asthma flares up when I'm
stressed. So I took a few extra pills.

13:44.204 --> 13:46.530
Stressed at work? At home?

13:47.249 --> 13:52.208
I'm a landscaper. January's tough.
Work stops, the bills don't.

13:52.380 --> 13:57.717
- Why the third degree?
- I have to ask about depression.

13:57.926 --> 14:00.880
If I wanted to die,
I'd find a better way.

14:01.096 --> 14:03.882
All fixed up.
They figure out what's wrong?

14:04.098 --> 14:08.392
Yeah. I took too much asthma medicine.
Busted up my hand.

14:08.561 --> 14:11.229
We have to find someone
to play left wing.

14:11.397 --> 14:14.813
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah. He should be.

14:16.902 --> 14:21.860
- How's the car?
- Totaled. Don't worry, you're insured.

14:22.074 --> 14:24.565
- Can I use this in here?
- Sure.

14:24.743 --> 14:25.988
I'll get a rental.

14:26.203 --> 14:28.658
- When did you pass gas?
- An hour ago.

14:28.871 --> 14:32.537
- No fever or vomiting.
- I agree with your assessment.

14:32.750 --> 14:36.913
Mr. Hoyt, you are full of stool.
We will give you an enema.

14:37.087 --> 14:40.955
- Excuse me, Doctor-
- Not now, we're busy. Come back later.

14:41.175 --> 14:44.379
- Peter, who's next?
- Splenectomy from last week.

14:44.596 --> 14:48.177
- Valerie's here for a heart transplant.
- Old news.

14:48.390 --> 14:51.759
- I stay informed.
- Then you know she has a fever.

14:51.977 --> 14:54.100
I didn't know.
Call the coordinator?

14:54.312 --> 14:57.183
- Not yet.
- Peter, call her and tell her we pass.

14:57.399 --> 14:58.644
Won't you examine her?

14:58.858 --> 15:03.437
- We can't operate if there's a fever.
- But her white count is normal.

15:03.655 --> 15:06.609
Good effort.
But a fever spells infection.

15:06.783 --> 15:09.154
It's an infection of her L-VAD.

15:09.368 --> 15:13.448
I did research on Medline
and found articles from Stanford.

15:13.789 --> 15:18.617
The treatment is antibiotics,
remove the device, give the new heart.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.954
Peter, go work her up.
I'll talk to the transplant service.

15:24.174 --> 15:29.334
You are like a crazed Energizer Bunny
on this. You keep going and going...

15:29.554 --> 15:31.676
- Thank you.
- ...and going and going...

15:31.889 --> 15:35.674
- We're out of I and D kits.
- I'll check the suture room.

15:35.894 --> 15:39.143
I don't need one.
Just wanted to let you know.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.222
Big trauma came in.
I haven't checked all my rooms yet.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.980
- I'm not criticizing you.
- I'll get to it.

15:46.153 --> 15:50.197
It must be strange coming back
after being off for six weeks.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.565
- Not really.
- If you need a break-

15:52.784 --> 15:54.823
- Why?
- Maybe you need sleep.

15:55.036 --> 15:56.779
I'm getting plenty of sleep.

16:00.041 --> 16:03.825
- Dr. Malucci, is there a problem?
- Yeah, chief. There is.

16:05.171 --> 16:07.841
- Check this out.
- Dolison?

16:08.007 --> 16:11.126
Her husband took them.
He's vomiting blood.

16:11.343 --> 16:12.885
What is this?

16:13.095 --> 16:16.630
They're from Mexico.
Combo painkiller and steroid.

16:16.848 --> 16:21.095
Unbelievable. Be sure ICU
gets him on a steroid taper.

16:22.479 --> 16:23.807
- Cleo.
- Yeah?

16:24.022 --> 16:28.649
When I said I was trying
to get out of here early...

16:28.860 --> 16:31.896
- ...to go eat-
- Wish I could get out early.

16:32.113 --> 16:36.656
- So, what if we made it later?
- Don't wait on me.

16:38.911 --> 16:39.990
Carol?

16:42.122 --> 16:44.245
- You all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.

16:45.750 --> 16:50.958
- You don't look fine.
- No, really. I am really fine.

16:51.173 --> 16:55.550
First day back must be tough.
Why don't you just leave?

16:55.761 --> 17:01.099
No. I'm gonna sit here and have
a good cry. And then I'll feel better.

17:01.307 --> 17:03.383
It's what I do at home.

17:05.935 --> 17:09.685
You see? I am-
I'm better already.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.435
Thanks, Elizabeth.

17:16.071 --> 17:19.522
- Carol, are you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

17:19.742 --> 17:22.861
- She's overwhelmed.
- I don't blame her.

17:23.078 --> 17:26.577
- The diapers, the dishes-
- The feedings. Laundry.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.117
- Then a 12-hour shift.
- How will she do it?

17:30.334 --> 17:32.576
Staying focused with the patients.

17:32.795 --> 17:35.796
All she wants to think about
are her babies.

17:39.968 --> 17:43.420
Carol, if there's anything
we can do...

17:45.683 --> 17:47.141
Okay.

17:50.645 --> 17:54.429
I'm really confused.
You were gonna cancel the transplant.

17:54.649 --> 17:56.890
And now I can have the heart?

17:57.109 --> 18:02.234
You need a day or two of antibiotics
before you can get the transplant.

18:02.740 --> 18:06.903
- So I lose the heart after all.
- No. You have a very low fever.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.820
We think we can clear up
the infection with a few doses...

18:11.040 --> 18:13.116
...and still do the transplant.

18:13.709 --> 18:16.081
If the antibiotics don't work?

18:17.338 --> 18:19.745
- Worst case?
- Yeah. Worst case.

18:20.006 --> 18:24.300
After surgery you could develop
a life-threatening infection.

18:30.308 --> 18:32.845
- What would you do?
- It's your decision.

18:33.102 --> 18:35.474
I know. Would you have the surgery?

18:36.480 --> 18:40.857
The risk is small.
And you've waited a long time.

18:42.694 --> 18:44.486
I would go for it.

18:48.992 --> 18:51.317
How long have you been with Curt?

18:51.786 --> 18:53.577
- A while.
- Everything okay?

18:53.788 --> 18:55.032
Yeah.

18:55.372 --> 18:57.828
What happens when the two
of you fight?

18:58.334 --> 19:00.327
What makes you think we fight?

19:00.795 --> 19:03.121
Everybody has arguments.

19:03.340 --> 19:08.677
You got bruises, stressed out.
You OD'd on your medication.

19:09.262 --> 19:11.669
I'm trying to put it all together.

19:14.682 --> 19:17.304
It's not uncommon for...

19:19.896 --> 19:22.268
...fights to turn physical.

19:22.524 --> 19:25.478
People don't mean for it to happen.

19:25.694 --> 19:28.184
No, no. I know they don't.

19:28.362 --> 19:32.063
Something just sets it off.
That ever happen to you?

19:37.079 --> 19:39.451
I forgot to get the dry cleaning.

19:40.123 --> 19:44.168
He- He hit me.

19:44.377 --> 19:47.960
He said he's sorry and promised
he'd never do it again.

19:48.423 --> 19:49.965
Has he?

19:53.219 --> 19:55.462
So there have been other times.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.769
I'd like you to talk
to a social worker.

20:02.437 --> 20:05.390
They have experience
with these things.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.107
Okay?

20:11.027 --> 20:14.397
I don't know. I don't know.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.948
Dr. Corday?

20:17.910 --> 20:22.203
- Lindsey, how are you?
- I'm all right.

20:22.414 --> 20:26.541
It was my sister's funeral yesterday.

20:28.002 --> 20:29.959
I wanted to thank you.

20:31.588 --> 20:33.665
You really don't have to.

20:35.259 --> 20:40.086
The police said that
he finally told you where he...

20:40.264 --> 20:41.295
...left Jenny.

20:42.807 --> 20:44.468
Yes.

20:46.187 --> 20:48.393
I'm trying to forget him.

20:50.023 --> 20:55.361
I just hear his voice all the time.
And it's very gentle.

20:55.570 --> 20:58.570
But it's just saying
these awful things.

20:58.781 --> 21:04.119
Now, you listen to me. That's what
he wanted. To make you suffer.

21:04.286 --> 21:06.611
You don't let him win.

21:06.789 --> 21:10.454
He's nothing.
He can't hurt you anymore.

21:10.876 --> 21:13.747
I know. I know.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.632
It's okay.

21:24.680 --> 21:28.891
- How long is the operation?
- Four, five hours.

21:29.101 --> 21:33.562
- They let med students watch?
- If they're on the transplant service.

21:33.772 --> 21:37.985
- That means you can't stay?
- They'll make an exception.

21:38.152 --> 21:40.191
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

21:40.988 --> 21:44.237
Can you do me a favor?
I forgot to feed Spoony.

21:44.450 --> 21:45.860
My cat. Tell my mom?

21:46.076 --> 21:49.278
Yes. I'm gonna go change.

21:49.579 --> 21:50.610
I'll see you.

21:57.253 --> 21:59.375
Can I have a moment with him?

22:11.100 --> 22:14.385
- I knew you'd come.
- Did you?

22:16.104 --> 22:21.394
When I woke up and I found you
hadn't done what you said you'd do...

22:21.609 --> 22:26.948
...I was glad. The fact that you were
a coward never even occurred to me.

22:32.662 --> 22:36.280
Your conscience is bothering you.
Isn't it?

22:40.544 --> 22:44.588
- It is, actually.
- Why? Because you nearly killed me?

22:45.423 --> 22:47.960
Or because you didn't
have the guts to?

22:48.175 --> 22:51.342
Because I enjoyed the power
I had over you.

22:51.554 --> 22:55.766
When I could've let you bleed
to death. When your heart stopped.

22:55.976 --> 22:58.264
When the morphine took you under.

22:58.478 --> 23:03.602
I held your breath in my hands and I
wanted to repay the pain you'd caused.

23:08.529 --> 23:11.363
But then I looked
at your sad little body.

23:11.573 --> 23:14.443
And I saw what a pathetic man you are.

23:14.658 --> 23:17.825
I realized I didn't want
power over you at all.

23:17.995 --> 23:22.788
That my job, for better or worse,
was simply to put you back together.

23:23.501 --> 23:28.840
See, I don't give a damn if you go to
the chair or spend your life in prison.

23:29.007 --> 23:34.345
My job's done. You were my patient,
you were sick, you're better.

23:36.180 --> 23:38.504
Goodbye, Mr. Rollins.

23:43.978 --> 23:46.018
- You can take him.
- Come back!

23:46.231 --> 23:50.394
I haven't finished with you yet!
Get back here, Corday!

23:50.610 --> 23:52.436
Corday!

23:56.115 --> 23:58.356
Do you have any chest pain?

23:58.575 --> 24:00.200
I'm a little lightheaded.

24:00.411 --> 24:04.360
- What happened?
- Code blue. She slipped on the ice.

24:04.539 --> 24:07.908
- I was helping Mom into the car.
- My wheelchair fell.

24:08.126 --> 24:11.709
Did you hit your head
or lose consciousness? Louise?

24:11.880 --> 24:14.917
I don't think so. I fell first.
I don't know.

24:15.133 --> 24:17.042
- Put her on a monitor.
- You want her?

24:17.260 --> 24:20.012
- I just discharged her.
- I believe in continuity of care.

24:20.222 --> 24:22.048
No head trauma, check her hips.

24:22.223 --> 24:24.760
- I'm so sorry, Mom.
- I'm all right.

24:24.975 --> 24:27.811
- Her BP is 170/95.
- Is that bad?

24:28.020 --> 24:29.395
It's a little high.

24:29.605 --> 24:33.733
Get a CBC, chem panel, cardiac
enzymes, EKG and postural vitals.

24:33.942 --> 24:35.519
I'm fine.

24:35.735 --> 24:39.604
- I'm just so tired.
- What was she here for?

24:40.407 --> 24:42.649
Exacerbation of Parkinson's.

24:42.868 --> 24:47.909
She hasn't been able to walk for days.
It's harder to take care of her.

24:50.041 --> 24:54.501
- Her head CT was normal.
- I see.

24:59.186 --> 25:02.270
- Atrial cannulation complete.
- Umbilical tape?

25:02.439 --> 25:05.724
- How long does the L-VAD stay?
- Until bypass.

25:05.942 --> 25:08.515
Aortic cannula's looking good.

25:08.736 --> 25:11.107
Here we go. Kill the air pump.

25:11.947 --> 25:17.105
- Clamp the aortic graft, Peter.
- Okay. And got it.

25:17.325 --> 25:19.319
Open the venous line.

25:21.955 --> 25:25.821
- Anyone looking for a heart?
- You're early, Shirley.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.081
Sorry. Take it up with the FAA.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.912
- Is it too early?
- No. It can wait on ice for a while.

25:33.006 --> 25:36.623
- Wow! That's her new heart.
- Yeah.

25:37.009 --> 25:38.717
It sure is.

25:40.137 --> 25:42.840
- He denied it?
- Said he never touched him.

25:43.055 --> 25:47.005
- I thought he was ready to talk.
- Victims change their minds.

25:47.226 --> 25:51.851
- He loves and wants to protect him.
- Or he's afraid. Will you be around?

25:52.063 --> 25:54.554
- Thinking about asking him again?
- Maybe.

25:54.774 --> 25:56.647
- Give me a call.
- Thanks.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.484
Carol, how are you?

25:58.695 --> 26:02.560
- Four hours and 43 minutes left.
- Counting minutes is bad.

26:02.780 --> 26:06.149
Can someone take this ingrown toenail?
A real bitch.

26:06.367 --> 26:07.446
Carol.

26:07.660 --> 26:12.155
- She's exhausted. She needs a break.
- I can't.

26:12.372 --> 26:15.040
- You can't? Or you won't?
- Both.

26:15.249 --> 26:19.033
- Just say you're ruling out a stroke.
- I can't lie.

26:19.253 --> 26:23.796
Sometimes we make a judgment call.
We bend the rules a little.

26:24.007 --> 26:26.414
I bent them and got in trouble.

26:26.634 --> 26:29.670
Then you're
in the wrong department.

26:29.845 --> 26:34.506
Listen, everybody does soft admits.
It's just part of the drill.

26:35.016 --> 26:38.385
I know what you're saying.
I'm not admitting her.

26:38.602 --> 26:41.270
She's my patient. It's my call.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.891
- Okay. Okay, you're right.
- Yeah?

26:45.108 --> 26:46.816
I don't agree with you.

26:47.027 --> 26:50.442
But you gotta do whatever
you think is best.

26:50.654 --> 26:54.069
- Well, thanks for your input.
- Anytime.

26:54.282 --> 26:57.864
Hey, Amira? I need a telemetry bed
for Louise Duffy.

26:58.410 --> 27:03.701
- Wait. You're admitting the daughter?
- Yeah. I want to rule out an Ml.

27:03.957 --> 27:07.324
- You're kidding?
- She may have unstable angina.

27:07.542 --> 27:12.169
- She slipped on some ice.
- It's my patient. It's my call.

27:12.381 --> 27:16.591
- Where's the mother supposed to go?
- Your patient. Your call.

27:18.886 --> 27:22.337
A bunch of us got into a fight
at the hockey rink.

27:22.556 --> 27:25.970
You're not gonna be safe
until you get out of this.

27:26.183 --> 27:27.641
I'll wear more pads.

27:27.852 --> 27:31.516
Most domestic homicides
have a history of physical abuse.

27:31.730 --> 27:33.888
- You trying to scare me?
- Yes.

27:34.107 --> 27:38.354
- You need to get away from him.
- I got the rental. We're set.

27:39.612 --> 27:40.692
- You okay?
- Fine.

27:40.905 --> 27:43.277
- Is he ready?
- We need a CT scan.

27:43.491 --> 27:45.648
- Why?
- He had a head trauma.

27:45.866 --> 27:49.485
- We play hockey.
- I want to clear him medically.

27:49.912 --> 27:52.581
- I wanna take him home.
- You should stay.

27:52.748 --> 27:55.582
- Do you understand the risk?
- He understands.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.076
- I'm not so sure.
- Why don't we-?

27:58.252 --> 27:59.746
Mike, shut up.

28:00.838 --> 28:04.420
If he needs to sign something,
he'll sign it. Right?

28:05.592 --> 28:08.759
You don't have to go.
It's your decision.

28:09.804 --> 28:14.015
Thanks. But I feel better now, really.
We should get home.

28:16.934 --> 28:19.341
One more dispo and I'm out of here.

28:19.896 --> 28:22.681
- What's that?
- It's from the vending machine.

28:22.897 --> 28:25.850
- And the cafeteria?
- No water. Can't cook.

28:26.067 --> 28:28.225
Then don't eat.
That'll kill you.

28:28.444 --> 28:31.812
Anyone seen Chuny?
I'm waiting for a translator.

28:32.030 --> 28:33.311
- Sorry.
- What's the problem?

28:33.532 --> 28:37.280
Father-daughter combo present
with aplastic anemia.

28:37.452 --> 28:40.821
- Both of them?
- Yeah. Strange. No toxic exposure.

28:41.039 --> 28:44.488
- Let me see.
- Bone marrow's not making squat.

28:44.707 --> 28:47.578
- They in there?
- Yeah. Why?

28:47.794 --> 28:50.367
- What are you doing?
- I got a hunch.

29:00.388 --> 29:01.467
- What?
- Hold on.

29:15.942 --> 29:17.650
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

29:27.453 --> 29:30.821
- What are they saying?
- They got shots for their colds.

29:31.039 --> 29:34.323
- Get the doctor's name?
- They went to a pharmacy.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.910
A shot from a pharmacy?

29:36.126 --> 29:39.825
Back-room clinic.
They smuggle drugs up from Mexico.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.124
Oh, God!

29:41.296 --> 29:43.205
He gave them aplastic anemia.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.667
- What are you doing?
- They gave me the address.

29:46.844 --> 29:48.835
We should call the police.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.509
They see a squad car, they'll bolt.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.179
- Cleo, we need you.
- Go ahead.

29:54.392 --> 29:58.305
- They're my patients. I'll handle it.
- They're all yours.

29:59.354 --> 30:00.551
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't worry.

30:00.771 --> 30:04.271
Trevor, we're gonna take care
of you, sweetheart.

30:04.483 --> 30:08.265
- Femur fracture?
- Auto versus pedestrian. He was alone.

30:08.485 --> 30:10.479
- Call my mom.
- We already tried.

30:10.655 --> 30:15.696
- Someone call Housekeeping!
- Amira, can you call Ortho?

30:15.993 --> 30:18.946
Can you walk?
I'll pull the car around.

30:23.458 --> 30:26.030
- Water's all hooked up.
- Oh, finally!

30:26.251 --> 30:29.122
- Somebody has to sign this.
- Dr. Greene?

30:29.296 --> 30:30.327
Sure. Why not?

30:30.547 --> 30:33.666
- Water back on?
- No. Gotta check the pressure.

30:33.882 --> 30:35.079
I'm in the ambulance bay.

30:35.258 --> 30:38.378
Can we page a beeper
on the code team?

30:38.595 --> 30:40.338
If you know the number.

30:41.723 --> 30:46.134
Isuprel's down to four mics.
50 cc's from the mediastinal tube.

30:46.351 --> 30:47.631
- Wow!
- What?

30:47.852 --> 30:50.557
Someone else's heart
is keeping her alive.

30:50.772 --> 30:53.688
Kind of cool.
Makes you want to be a surgeon?

30:53.857 --> 30:59.195
- Vent settings?
- Tidal volume: 700. AC: 14. Fl: 02.5.

30:59.404 --> 31:04.742
- Shouldn't she be breathing on her own?
- Anesthesia lasts longer in some.

31:07.829 --> 31:11.031
Dr. Benton, her gaze
is deviated to the right.

31:15.001 --> 31:17.538
Valerie, squeeze my hand!

31:20.171 --> 31:23.088
We're going to CT. Call Radiology.
Unhook her.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.670
Let's bag her. Let's go! Come on!

31:26.968 --> 31:30.302
- Did you page the right number?
- I hope so.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.548
He's coming! He's coming!

31:34.225 --> 31:36.016
Oh, my God!

31:42.857 --> 31:45.430
Oh, my God!
John, are you all right?

31:46.193 --> 31:48.067
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.562
Now, that's a 10.

31:50.863 --> 31:54.398
- Looking good there, Carter.
- So, no code?

31:54.617 --> 31:56.776
No code. You okay?

31:56.994 --> 31:58.821
I could've killed myself.

31:59.038 --> 32:02.322
- It's payback time.
- Payback for what?

32:02.665 --> 32:04.408
For blackmailing me.

32:05.292 --> 32:07.866
I admitted Mrs. Duffy.

32:08.754 --> 32:11.540
- Really?
- You're surprised?

32:11.756 --> 32:15.670
You think I'm so heartless,
I'd ship her to a nursing home?

32:15.885 --> 32:20.261
- You were heartless to discharge her.
- If I were really heartless...

32:20.471 --> 32:24.932
...I wouldn't tell you that there's
toilet paper stuck to your shoe.

32:27.978 --> 32:29.555
What was that?

32:31.439 --> 32:33.598
Somebody help!

32:35.943 --> 32:36.974
What happened?

32:37.194 --> 32:41.025
He was putting stuff in the trunk!
We should move him!

32:41.239 --> 32:44.156
- We need a backboard!
- He's got a flail chest!

32:44.366 --> 32:47.153
Malik, get an airway kit
and Dr. Greene.

32:47.369 --> 32:51.663
- And turn this water off!
- I thought I had it in first gear.

32:51.874 --> 32:54.246
- It went backwards!
- He's barely breathing!

32:54.459 --> 32:57.910
- My God, I'm sorry!
- Don't worry. We got it.

33:01.298 --> 33:05.342
- This guy needs chest tubes.
- I'll intubate. 80 tube.

33:05.552 --> 33:08.124
- Wait out here.
- I'm losing the pulse!

33:08.303 --> 33:12.632
Okay. Set up the rapid infuser
and prep for a thoracotomy.

33:14.476 --> 33:17.726
- Decreased breath.
- Prep the chest.

33:17.937 --> 33:20.890
- He backed into him?
- Pinned him to the truck.

33:21.106 --> 33:23.811
- Tachy at 128.
- Pressure's down to 70.

33:24.026 --> 33:28.104
- Give me a 10 blade.
- Set up two Thora-Seals and suction.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.396
I'm in. Bag him.

33:30.656 --> 33:33.490
- 32 French. Let's go.
- Curved Kelly.

33:33.700 --> 33:38.112
- Pulse ox dropping to 82.
- Mine's in. Hook it up.

33:38.412 --> 33:40.204
Thora-Seal's not bubbling.

33:40.414 --> 33:42.988
- Pressure's at 60.
- There's no suction.

33:43.167 --> 33:45.159
All right. Try the other one.

33:45.543 --> 33:47.582
- Nope.
- What's going on?

33:47.795 --> 33:51.496
Wall suction's generated by water.
No water, no suction.

33:51.716 --> 33:55.332
Chuny, go down to Central
and get a portable suction.

33:55.509 --> 33:59.423
- I'm in.
- Pulse ox, 75.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.390
We need to re-expand his lungs.

34:02.599 --> 34:06.513
- We're waiting on suction.
- What about that vacuum cleaner?

34:06.728 --> 34:08.684
The guy was using it at Admit.

34:08.897 --> 34:10.688
- Lydia?
- Got it.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.726
We need something like clay
to make a seal.

34:14.108 --> 34:17.193
- Merocel sponges.
- We'll need 20 of them.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.902
- Amp of atropine.
- Get the crash cart.

34:21.114 --> 34:24.364
- Found him.
- Bring it down and get me water.

34:24.826 --> 34:26.864
Lost his pulse. We're in P.E.A.

34:27.077 --> 34:30.860
- Okay, amp of epi.
- Start chest compressions.

34:31.205 --> 34:33.329
Sats are down to 72.

34:34.877 --> 34:36.371
Okay, pour it.

34:36.712 --> 34:39.831
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

34:44.634 --> 34:48.217
Okay. Okay, here we go.
Hold compressions.

34:57.186 --> 34:58.302
Yep.

34:58.730 --> 35:02.430
- I hear breath sounds.
- Pulse ox up to 85.

35:02.650 --> 35:04.227
Ninety-two.

35:05.318 --> 35:06.563
Good save.

35:20.497 --> 35:22.573
- Dr. Romano-
- Just a second.

35:33.009 --> 35:34.419
Thanks, Peter.

35:36.928 --> 35:38.587
It was a stroke.

35:39.514 --> 35:43.890
Yes. They tried streptokinase
but couldn't open up the vessel.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.259
- Can she recover?
- Truth?

35:46.936 --> 35:49.606
She's in a permanent vegetative state.

35:51.565 --> 35:54.436
- The L-VAD gave her a brain clot.
- We don't know.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.732
This is not your fault.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.941
I'm the one who put it in, remember?

36:00.782 --> 36:04.399
We make medical decisions.
Nothing is risk-free.

36:06.202 --> 36:10.413
- I better go talk to her mother.
- Yeah. Hold on.

36:10.622 --> 36:14.749
UNOS has identified a potential
recipient in Milwaukee.

36:15.252 --> 36:19.202
- What are you talking about?
- A domino heart procedure.

36:19.423 --> 36:24.497
We give the new heart to someone else.
You need to get family consent.

36:28.638 --> 36:31.888
- But she'll-
- She's already dead, Miss Knight.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.474
- Where's he going?
- Four east, ICU.

36:44.652 --> 36:48.518
- Thanks. He's gonna be okay?
- We'll see.

36:48.947 --> 36:50.524
Tell me what happened.

36:50.741 --> 36:55.484
He asked me to pop the trunk.
I was trying to pull forward.

36:55.660 --> 36:59.989
- I thought I had it in first but I-
- You went backwards.

37:00.206 --> 37:02.778
I'm not used to driving a stick.

37:06.753 --> 37:11.995
I thought they'd have to admit me for
hypothermia. Do you want to use this?

37:12.258 --> 37:13.752
I'm okay.

37:14.593 --> 37:15.921
Cool trauma.

37:16.136 --> 37:18.531
It's not so bad
when doctors work together.

37:18.747 --> 37:21.949
Assess the patient,
come up with a plan.

37:26.936 --> 37:31.263
Are you still angry about the way
I handled Louise and Mrs. Duffy?

37:31.438 --> 37:32.553
No.

37:32.731 --> 37:35.683
- You're mad about the practical joke?
- No.

37:35.900 --> 37:40.191
I'm disappointed that you couldn't
admit you made a mistake.

37:40.401 --> 37:44.776
That your way of dealing with it was
to devise some silly gag.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.517
You're right.

37:46.737 --> 37:50.401
Things will be easier if you deal
with things honestly.

37:50.573 --> 37:53.322
John- Thank you.

37:53.532 --> 37:58.869
- Oh, and, no more practical jokes.
- That's a good idea.

38:12.042 --> 38:13.748
She said yes.

38:14.167 --> 38:17.417
Hey, Lucy. I'm sorry.

38:44.849 --> 38:48.383
- I got x-rays on that belly pain.
- Finally.

38:48.602 --> 38:51.388
Water's back for an hour.
What takes so long?

38:51.604 --> 38:52.883
I don't know.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.605
- Oh, my God!
- What?

38:57.815 --> 38:59.641
My patient ate nails!

38:59.858 --> 39:03.022
Chuny, call O.R
and get Surgery down right now.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.437
What are you doing?

39:11.572 --> 39:13.729
- Made it through the day?
- Almost.

39:13.948 --> 39:15.738
Good to have you back!

39:15.907 --> 39:19.406
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Malucci. What'd you do?

39:19.577 --> 39:23.193
- Nothing, chief. Just a sucker punch-
- Broken bones?

39:23.411 --> 39:25.735
Short a few brain cells.

39:25.954 --> 39:29.701
- Guard with your left next time.
- Right. Thanks, chief.

39:30.706 --> 39:34.998
I tell him I have a sore throat,
he doesn't even look in my mouth.

39:35.625 --> 39:38.245
- Dipyrone.
- The FDA banned this.

39:38.418 --> 39:43.292
He brings out a vial and wants
to give me a shot. Chloramphenicol.

39:43.505 --> 39:46.041
- You didn't.
- No. I grabbed it and ran.

39:46.256 --> 39:49.706
- That's when it got violent.
- Hope it was worth it.

39:49.925 --> 39:52.213
I got evidence.
They're going down.

39:52.634 --> 39:54.377
Cleo, you got a minute?

39:54.594 --> 39:57.627
Sure. Hold that.

40:02.347 --> 40:07.053
- So, you gonna be able to get off?
- Yeah, looks like it.

40:07.266 --> 40:09.803
- Wanna get dinner?
- Where you guys going?

40:10.018 --> 40:13.266
- It's just us.
- What happened to everybody?

40:13.436 --> 40:17.728
- That's what I was trying to explain.
- Are you asking me out?

40:18.773 --> 40:20.396
Yeah.

40:24.275 --> 40:27.476
- What do you think?
- He's pretty shaken up.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.814
- He had a seizure?
- Right.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.233
You cleared him to drive?

40:32.446 --> 40:35.813
He doesn't have epilepsy.
Too much asthma medicine.

40:36.031 --> 40:38.355
He didn't have any in his system.

40:38.574 --> 40:41.194
Okay. Anything else I should know?

40:41.450 --> 40:44.782
- No. That's it.
- Okay, thanks.

40:52.372 --> 40:56.783
- Hey. Everything okay?
- Police are satisfied with your story.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.534
- I guess you got what you wanted.
- How's that?

41:01.752 --> 41:04.243
I'll be safe at home tonight.

41:06.421 --> 41:09.456
The social worker's around.
Why don't we-?

41:09.673 --> 41:11.878
No. No, I'm all right now.

41:13.049 --> 41:16.915
Dr. Greene, your pops locked himself
out of your apartment.

41:17.135 --> 41:18.414
Okay, Malik.

41:19.802 --> 41:23.252
Thanks, Dr. Greene.
I appreciate your encouragement.

41:37.645 --> 41:41.641
- Lucy, you look like you're freezing.
- What?

41:41.856 --> 41:44.475
It started snowing.
You look very cold.

41:44.648 --> 41:46.225
I am.

41:49.067 --> 41:51.224
- No. That's okay.
- No, come on.

41:51.444 --> 41:55.274
- I'm European. We like to be gallant.
- Thanks.

41:58.447 --> 42:00.818
So, are you off?

42:01.033 --> 42:03.651
I've got two tickets for the circus.

42:03.824 --> 42:06.112
No. Actually, I'm just coming on.

42:06.325 --> 42:09.279
Then what were you doing here all day?

42:09.619 --> 42:12.025
Not enough, as it turns out.

42:17.540 --> 42:20.374
It's never been easy
for me to be here.

42:21.625 --> 42:24.411
Sometimes I felt like
I would never fit in.

42:26.752 --> 42:29.159
That's something I know about.

42:29.713 --> 42:35.049
But then I've moved around a lot.
And now I'm used to it.

42:38.717 --> 42:43.958
At the beginning of every day, I'm
grateful that I'm walking in here...

42:44.595 --> 42:47.168
...and not being carried
in on a gurney.

42:49.014 --> 42:53.224
And at the end of every day,
if I've helped just one person...

42:53.433 --> 42:54.975
...it's been worth it.

43:00.728 --> 43:04.095
That didn't happen today.
And it makes me sad.

43:07.148 --> 43:09.685
Hey, your day is not over.

43:11.192 --> 43:14.191
- Maybe this is your one person.
- Doubt it.

43:14.777 --> 43:18.725
Yes. But let's see if I'm right, huh?

43:20.030 --> 43:25.366
- And miss the circus?
- I have had enough circus for today.

43:27.908 --> 43:28.939
Come on.

43:32.202 --> 43:33.660
What have you got?

43:33.870 --> 43:36.538
Paul Galinski, snowmobile into a tree.

43:36.746 --> 43:40.694
Facial fractures. Couldn't tube him.
Too much blood.
