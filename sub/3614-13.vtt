WEBVTT

00:05.049 --> 00:08.803
The lions observed in the Ngorongoro
Crater of Tanzania mated,

00:08.969 --> 00:12.518
on average, once an hour
for a week straight.

00:12.689 --> 00:16.477
Now, before I lose half the room
to that thought, answer me this:

00:16.689 --> 00:17.917
Where does it begin?

00:18.089 --> 00:20.967
And the purpose of all animals is
the proliferation of the species, right?

00:21.129 --> 00:23.518
But it isn't as easy as,
"Your nest or mine?"

00:23.729 --> 00:26.289
It starts with a series
of mating rituals.

00:26.769 --> 00:31.285
First, an animal must get the attention
of the object it desires.

00:31.449 --> 00:34.486
Next, there must be a sign
that the interest is mutual.

00:34.649 --> 00:38.403
But as we've all learned from
painful experience, an animal...

00:38.569 --> 00:40.799
What's up with my study group
having fun without me?

00:40.969 --> 00:42.960
Sorry, Phoebe. You looked busy.

00:43.169 --> 00:46.002
Use your time in section tomorrow
to outline your group's thesis.

00:46.169 --> 00:48.637
Be specific. Better yet,
just spell-check.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.648
I'll see you next week.

00:56.689 --> 00:58.168
Is that a book of love spells?

00:58.329 --> 01:01.287
Yeah, found it in the Valentine's Day
display over at the campus bookstore.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.845
- It's stupid.
- Is not.

01:04.049 --> 01:07.564
We figured since we're dateless this
year, maybe it'll give us some laughs.

01:09.449 --> 01:10.438
What?

01:11.009 --> 01:13.807
Oh, nothing. It's just,
they've got it backwards.

01:14.009 --> 01:17.160
You would never say it in that order.
First you say what's lacking,

01:17.329 --> 01:19.889
then what's needed. Here, try this:

01:20.049 --> 01:23.837
From strike of 12, count 24
That's how long the spell is for

01:24.009 --> 01:28.241
If to abate my lonely heart
Enchant these gifts I thee impart

01:28.409 --> 01:30.001
See?

01:32.129 --> 01:36.486
I'm doing a paper on the
growing popularity of witchcraft.

01:37.449 --> 01:40.009
Hey, if you guys want something fun
to do tomorrow night,

01:40.169 --> 01:41.921
you should check out
my sister's club.

01:42.649 --> 01:44.719
- Oh, cool.
- No dates required.

01:44.929 --> 01:46.408
- Okay.
- Okay, we'll be there.

01:46.569 --> 01:48.366
- See you at section tomorrow.
- Okay.

01:55.609 --> 01:59.045
Hey, there's a party tomorrow night.

01:59.209 --> 02:01.006
You should come.

02:01.169 --> 02:03.364
- Why?
- Because I'll be there.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.049 --> 02:14.040
Okay, I'm freaked.
Can we turn some lights on?

02:14.209 --> 02:16.769
- No, we can't. Can we?
- It will spoil the mood.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.284
Come on, it says to join hands.

02:19.769 --> 02:22.761
We're not gonna hurt them, are we? I
promised Spencer I'd get his pig back.

02:22.929 --> 02:25.443
It's a joke spell, Tessa.
This is just supposed to be fun.

02:25.769 --> 02:29.762
You could choose any animal to turn
into a man, and you chose a pig?

02:29.969 --> 02:32.847
It's widely known that pigs are the
most intelligent species, that's why.

02:33.009 --> 02:35.364
Well, then we all know
why Andrea chose a rabbit.

02:35.529 --> 02:37.804
Just keep your fingers clear.
He scratches.

02:37.969 --> 02:39.925
Kinky. Exactly why I brought a snake.

02:40.089 --> 02:42.762
Okay, let's do this. Say it with me.

02:42.929 --> 02:47.719
From strike of 12, count 24
That's how long the spell is for

02:47.889 --> 02:51.962
Turn these gifts into a mate
And then my lonely heart abate

02:54.969 --> 02:56.641
Okay, that was fun. Can I go now?

02:56.809 --> 02:59.198
Wait. Now, didn't Phoebe say
some of the words were wrong?

02:59.409 --> 03:00.842
Why don't you call her.

03:01.009 --> 03:04.285
Don't have to. Power of technology.

03:06.369 --> 03:08.121
No dates required.

03:09.889 --> 03:14.041
From strike of 12, count 24
That's how long the spell is for

03:14.209 --> 03:17.679
If to abate my lonely heart
Enchant these gifts I thee impart

05:21.929 --> 05:25.160
- What's wrong with this picture?
- Okay, is that rhetorical,

05:25.329 --> 05:28.287
or do I actually have to open
my eyes to look at something?

05:28.449 --> 05:29.768
Well, it is a weekday,

05:29.929 --> 05:31.885
and Phoebe Halliwell
is already at campus,

05:32.049 --> 05:34.517
while Prue Halliwell,
master of the morning meeting,

05:34.689 --> 05:39.126
- sultan of scheduling and queen of...
- Got it.

05:39.649 --> 05:42.004
How's it feel to be footloose
and office-free?

05:42.169 --> 05:44.524
Amazing. You know
what I'm gonna do today?

05:44.689 --> 05:46.759
- What?
- Absolutely nothing.

05:46.969 --> 05:49.244
Nothing? Really, Prue?

05:49.409 --> 05:52.765
Nothing entails physically doing
nothing, thinking about nothing

05:52.929 --> 05:55.284
and worrying about nothing,
as opposed to your sister here,

05:55.449 --> 05:57.041
who is so in the middle
of something.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.368
Okay, sweetie. What is wrong?

06:01.529 --> 06:04.282
Well, for starters, there's tomorrow.

06:06.049 --> 06:07.880
Valentine's Day?

06:08.169 --> 06:10.046
Wow, I completely forgot.

06:11.369 --> 06:13.325
See? I'm doing nothing already.

06:13.809 --> 06:16.687
And Dan wants me to have
V-Day dinner with him.

06:17.489 --> 06:19.002
Oh, that's good.

06:19.449 --> 06:21.724
Yeah. Except for the fact
that there's...

06:21.889 --> 06:25.404
Leo? I mean, he is mortal now.
Doesn't that change things?

06:26.209 --> 06:30.168
Piper, you're my sister,
and I'm with you,

06:30.329 --> 06:34.527
whatever and whoever you choose.

06:41.649 --> 06:43.446
I need to eat.

06:45.809 --> 06:47.765
Another satisfied customer.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.840
You've already eaten
everything in our fridge.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.603
Brooke will be back with food
any minute. Just wait, okay?

06:52.769 --> 06:54.839
Whoa, what are we
supposed to do until then?

06:55.329 --> 06:58.321
Fine question. What should we do?

06:59.129 --> 07:01.006
You two are acting
like nothing's changed,

07:01.169 --> 07:04.559
like you're still trapped
in the confines of your cages.

07:04.729 --> 07:06.959
- Behaving like animals.
- That's what you are.

07:07.129 --> 07:09.359
Not anymore, thanks to you.

07:09.609 --> 07:13.318
We've been given a gift.
It's time to take it out for a test drive,

07:13.969 --> 07:16.688
see what the world looks like
from up here.

07:16.889 --> 07:19.767
You can't.
I mean, you have to stay here.

07:24.129 --> 07:25.164
Wait!

07:26.529 --> 07:28.838
Yeah, you got my CD, man?

07:45.529 --> 07:48.760
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah. Try covering up, dude.

07:51.249 --> 07:53.479
Remedy the situation.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.204
- Hey! What the...?
- Hey, man.

07:58.009 --> 07:58.998
Hey, man.

07:59.929 --> 08:02.443
Hey. What are you doing?

08:02.649 --> 08:04.367
Who are those guys?

08:21.889 --> 08:23.800
Who are these for?

08:24.009 --> 08:25.761
They're for you.

08:26.049 --> 08:28.927
- I know they're not much.
- They're beautiful.

08:29.409 --> 08:32.048
- But, Leo...
- But it's the best I could do.

08:32.529 --> 08:36.203
You know, no ID, no mode
of transportation, no money.

08:36.369 --> 08:38.678
I just wanted you to have
something, mark the day.

08:39.448 --> 08:42.645
Thank you.
I have something for you too.

08:42.808 --> 08:45.926
Although not nearly as romantic,
but still a good thing.

08:46.089 --> 08:49.365
Your first paycheque. Or cash, rather.
I thought it'd be easier.

08:50.569 --> 08:52.241
So did I.

08:52.889 --> 08:54.607
Anyway, thanks.

08:55.609 --> 08:58.965
Looks like after everything, I'm still
working for the Charmed Ones.

08:59.809 --> 09:01.925
Is all this...?
Are you doing okay with it?

09:02.089 --> 09:04.205
Yeah. Kind of making it up as I go.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.599
But, Piper, if me being here
is awkward for you...

09:06.889 --> 09:08.561
No.

09:08.729 --> 09:11.323
What's there to be awkward about?

09:15.209 --> 09:17.200
These go in the back, right?

09:24.689 --> 09:25.804
What are those?

09:25.969 --> 09:28.802
I thought we were gonna wait
until tonight.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.561
You're right.
I should take them back.

09:30.809 --> 09:33.004
Don't you dare.

09:33.209 --> 09:34.927
Give them to me.

09:36.969 --> 09:40.245
They're beautiful. Thank you.

09:46.809 --> 09:49.369
Piper? Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

09:49.569 --> 09:51.480
Not that I know of.

09:53.929 --> 09:55.647
You sure?

09:57.889 --> 09:59.402
Dan. Hey.

09:59.809 --> 10:01.367
Leo.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.567
You never mentioned he was here.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.363
- Leo's here.
- Yeah.

10:13.569 --> 10:17.357
You're right. I meant to,
and then things got busy,

10:18.009 --> 10:21.888
so I didn't, and I'm sorry.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.478
- He's just helping out.
- With what, exactly?

10:24.649 --> 10:29.439
You know, handyman, busboy,
bar back, security-type stuff.

10:30.049 --> 10:33.678
He needed a place to stay,
and it's really not a big deal, Dan.

10:33.889 --> 10:35.845
That's just the point. It is.

10:36.329 --> 10:39.048
When you were sick,
you called out his name, not mine.

10:39.409 --> 10:41.081
And I was right there with you.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.763
When he's around, you're,

10:43.929 --> 10:46.807
I don't know, different.
We're different.

10:47.009 --> 10:49.398
- How do you want me to handle that?
- I don't know.

10:49.569 --> 10:52.527
And to tell you the truth,
if the situation were reversed,

10:52.689 --> 10:54.680
I don't know how I would feel.

10:54.849 --> 10:56.999
But I do know how I feel right now.

10:57.209 --> 10:58.437
How do you feel?

10:58.609 --> 11:00.759
Like for the first time
in a very long time,

11:00.929 --> 11:03.762
I'm actually looking forward
to a Valentine's Day dinner.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.920
And you're the reason.

11:14.209 --> 11:16.439
Hi, is Briana there?

11:17.009 --> 11:19.000
Of course she's at work.

11:19.169 --> 11:21.763
Yeah, hi, this is Prue calling.

11:21.929 --> 11:25.319
No, you can actually
just erase that number.

11:25.489 --> 11:28.561
She can reach me at home.

11:29.249 --> 11:31.809
Home. I'll be home.

11:31.969 --> 11:33.925
Okay, bye.

11:49.569 --> 11:51.161
Prue Hall...

11:51.329 --> 11:53.524
- Hello?
- Hello, yourself.

11:53.689 --> 11:56.157
- How is the life of leisure going?
- It's great.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.887
I don't know why you ever gave it up.

11:58.049 --> 12:01.837
Yeah. Because that house is only big
enough for one homebound Halliwell.

12:02.009 --> 12:04.284
Hey, I'm just on my way to class,
but I wanted to know

12:04.449 --> 12:06.963
if Brooke or Andrea or Tessa called.

12:07.129 --> 12:09.404
No, no one called. Nobody.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.003
No one. Zip.

12:11.169 --> 12:13.000
- Nada. Zilch.
- That is so weird.

12:13.209 --> 12:14.847
They never showed up
for our section today.

12:15.009 --> 12:16.761
Hey, watch it!

12:19.769 --> 12:21.885
Hey, buddy, get in line.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.279
- What's happening over there?
- Come on.

12:24.689 --> 12:26.486
How could you do this to them?

12:28.809 --> 12:30.845
- Run! Run, my brothers.
- Who is that guy?

12:31.169 --> 12:34.559
- Run free!
- What is he doing?

12:36.809 --> 12:39.801
So hey, Phoebe, I was wondering
if maybe we could meet for lunch.

12:39.969 --> 12:43.166
And if you're crunched on time,
then I can just come to the campus.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.285
I was gonna pick up a sandwich
on the way to class.

12:45.449 --> 12:47.724
Okay, so, what about after class?
We could go to the gym.

12:49.529 --> 12:51.440
- You're hurting me!
- Pheebs?

12:51.649 --> 12:54.527
- Stop! I told you to get off!
- I gotta go, Prue.

12:56.289 --> 12:58.200
Hey, is there a problem?

13:10.049 --> 13:11.926
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.847
Hey, man.

13:32.449 --> 13:35.521
Oh, we so have to cancel
your Martha Stewart subscription.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.283
When I start making flower boxes
out of milk cartons,

13:38.449 --> 13:40.599
- then you can shoot me.
- No problem.

13:40.769 --> 13:43.886
So do you need help with anything?

13:44.329 --> 13:47.446
- What happened to doing nothing?
- I'm finished.

13:47.609 --> 13:48.928
You can't finish doing nothing.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.398
So then how do you know
when you're done?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.366
Put your finger on this.

13:54.809 --> 13:56.606
- It's for Dan.
- What did you get him?

13:56.929 --> 13:59.159
This book on San Francisco
architecture.

14:00.449 --> 14:03.486
I know, I know. It's a little too
impersonal for Valentine's Day, but...

14:03.889 --> 14:05.686
No. No.

14:05.849 --> 14:09.762
Shows that you know him.
It's perfect for him.

14:09.929 --> 14:13.399
- What did you get Leo?
- Leo? But... Should I?

14:13.569 --> 14:15.958
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

14:16.169 --> 14:17.602
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.600
Okay, guess what I saw
on Pheeb TV.

14:19.769 --> 14:21.805
No, not a premonition.
It's Valentine's Day.

14:21.969 --> 14:24.039
Can't there be some kind
of supernatural day off?

14:24.249 --> 14:26.763
- What did you see?
- There was a guy harassing this girl,

14:26.929 --> 14:29.045
so I tried to stop him, and wham.

14:29.209 --> 14:33.407
It was really weird.
Like, a guy biting a girl.

14:33.569 --> 14:36.606
Biting or kissing?
It is that time of the year.

14:36.769 --> 14:39.727
- It could've been kissing.
- Maybe. It could have been, I guess.

14:39.889 --> 14:42.881
Most people kiss on Valentine's Day.
Except, of course, for witches.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.519
Witches don't kiss on Valentine's Day,
because something always comes up.

14:46.689 --> 14:50.159
Okay, maybe it was just some drunk
frat guy and his chick of the moment.

14:50.329 --> 14:53.082
Yeah, maybe. It just...
It wasn't very clear.

14:53.249 --> 14:57.800
And then I followed him,
and I think he jumped over this wall.

14:58.369 --> 14:59.882
He jumped over a wall?

15:00.089 --> 15:02.762
Yeah, well, there was a ladder
pretty close.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.402
Phoebe, come on.
Doesn't anybody care

15:04.569 --> 15:07.402
that I have dinner plans tonight
with Dan?

15:07.809 --> 15:11.404
Oh, honey, is that what he got you?

15:11.569 --> 15:14.800
I mean, it's nice and all,
just a little impersonal.

15:16.609 --> 15:18.645
What'd she get for Leo?

15:19.289 --> 15:20.847
What'd you get Leo?

15:23.209 --> 15:24.688
But we missed section.

15:24.849 --> 15:26.999
It's Valentine's Day.
I wanna find my date.

15:27.169 --> 15:29.319
Are you sure?
I mean, this isn't natural.

15:29.489 --> 15:32.322
You said it was just a joke,
and now they are human beings.

15:32.489 --> 15:33.638
- Pretty cool, huh?
- No.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.288
No, it's not.
We should turn them back.

15:35.449 --> 15:38.088
Just chill. Wait until midnight,
and they'll turn back on their own.

15:38.249 --> 15:39.238
Yeah.

15:42.849 --> 15:43.918
What does this mean?

15:44.529 --> 15:46.884
It's a spell.
That's what made you human.

15:48.049 --> 15:50.483
Yes, but for how long?

15:55.649 --> 15:56.798
He asked you a question.

15:58.209 --> 16:02.407
Twenty-four hours.
But actually, now it's more like 12.

16:02.969 --> 16:04.721
Well, fix it.

16:04.889 --> 16:06.607
We've decided
we'd like to stay this way.

16:06.889 --> 16:09.483
Yeah, we're having fun.

16:10.049 --> 16:12.722
Yeah, it sure looks like it.
Now, am I wrong here,

16:12.929 --> 16:17.047
- but aren't you supposed to be mine?
- Aren't you having fun, Andrea?

16:17.249 --> 16:20.798
You know, you can have
much more fun if we had more time.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.401
- I might know how.
- No.

16:23.769 --> 16:26.283
Okay, maybe I don't,
but I know someone who might.

16:26.449 --> 16:28.565
Phoebe, yeah.
She'll be at the party tonight.

16:28.769 --> 16:31.920
Wait, I have the class roster.
I know where she lives.

16:32.809 --> 16:34.208
Show us the way.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.837
We're gonna eat, though, right?

16:37.009 --> 16:40.001
- I don't think we should be messing...
- Why don't you go on ahead.

16:40.889 --> 16:42.766
We'll catch up.

16:51.489 --> 16:56.119
Now, why do you have to be
such a little troublemaker?

17:04.848 --> 17:06.077
Thanks for keeping me company.

17:06.249 --> 17:08.204
Better here than at the club
with Prue.

17:08.368 --> 17:12.601
This boredom has turned her
into the demon of decoration.

17:13.449 --> 17:18.000
Why don't they make a card that says,
"You used to be my whitelighter,

17:18.169 --> 17:21.080
and now your wings are clipped,
and you're sleeping in my club"?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.319
Or how about,
"You snooze, you lose,

17:23.489 --> 17:26.242
and now I'm getting naked
with the neighbour."

17:26.489 --> 17:27.683
Hey.

17:27.888 --> 17:29.607
What about this one?

17:30.129 --> 17:32.040
Oh, yeah. Yeah, very sweet.

17:35.169 --> 17:36.488
And what is that supposed to say?

17:36.649 --> 17:39.721
That says something in Portuguese,
but at least you won't have to worry

17:39.889 --> 17:41.527
about him taking it the wrong way.

17:41.689 --> 17:43.839
Thank you. Oh, no.

17:44.009 --> 17:46.842
"To the special person who lights up
my day, I'll treasure you always."

17:47.009 --> 17:50.558
- Oh, of course.
- And then I'll spit up on myself.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.805
The girls in school are reading this.

17:52.969 --> 17:55.483
The ones in my class.
We are so in right now.

17:56.009 --> 17:59.843
We are not in, love is, and this stuff
gives people hope that they can find it.

18:00.009 --> 18:02.239
Yeah, the problem is,
people think they can get into magic

18:02.409 --> 18:03.842
without dealing
with the consequences.

18:04.009 --> 18:05.806
None of this is like
in the Book of Shadows.

18:05.969 --> 18:07.721
I mean, for one thing,
it doesn't really work.

18:07.889 --> 18:10.562
I mean, normal people
can't make this work.

18:10.769 --> 18:12.327
Right?

18:12.529 --> 18:14.918
- Pheebs?
- Not without a little help.

18:17.649 --> 18:20.721
I have to go call Prue.
I think I need her help with something.

18:20.889 --> 18:24.325
Something to do? She'll be thrilled.

18:24.969 --> 18:26.880
Okey-dokey.

18:31.969 --> 18:33.402
Now, that's a card.

18:42.569 --> 18:44.207
This will do.

18:57.489 --> 19:01.767
Hello? Worker bees? Anyone?

19:24.569 --> 19:26.799
This will ruin the dinner
that I'm gonna buy you tonight.

19:26.969 --> 19:29.244
You are so sweet.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.960
Piper red label?

19:33.849 --> 19:36.647
Well, with a name like that,
I figured it would be the best.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.128
I mean, this is our first holiday.

19:38.569 --> 19:42.084
Granted, a holiday invented
by Hallmark,

19:42.249 --> 19:44.205
but first, it's just the same.

19:49.329 --> 19:50.887
Is that for me?

20:03.809 --> 20:05.561
"To a dear friend
on Valentine's Day."

20:08.369 --> 20:11.566
Piper, it's good to know
that you're deeply in like with me.

20:12.049 --> 20:13.687
It isn't for me. It's for Leo, isn't it?

20:15.849 --> 20:17.646
- What do you want me to say?
- How about "no."

20:17.809 --> 20:20.846
Dan, you read it. Read it again.
It says "to a friend."

20:21.009 --> 20:24.285
And I'm sorry, but I'm not interested
in ending that particular friendship.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.400
I'm not sure that's all he sees it as.

20:26.569 --> 20:28.446
I come with a past. We all do.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.805
It's a package,
one I would like to share with you,

20:30.969 --> 20:32.322
but you can't pick and choose.

20:32.489 --> 20:34.400
- You get all of me.
- Do I?

20:35.329 --> 20:37.559
Okay. I've gotta work.

20:37.729 --> 20:39.526
So why don't I just see you tonight.

20:41.289 --> 20:42.688
Fine.

20:44.289 --> 20:45.847
Fine.

20:46.409 --> 20:49.446
I just love Valentine's Day.

20:52.449 --> 20:55.600
- You can't do this.
- This is going too far.

20:55.769 --> 20:57.839
Rules, like cages,
were meant to be broken.

20:58.009 --> 21:01.126
Okay, since leaving campus, you guys
have beaten a pedestrian to a pulp

21:01.289 --> 21:03.120
and played chicken
with a car-pool mom.

21:03.289 --> 21:05.962
- Are you on something?
- Or just your average crazy?

21:06.409 --> 21:07.683
Look, Tessa seemed fine.

21:07.889 --> 21:11.165
But if she's really not feeling well
like you said, we should go home.

21:11.369 --> 21:13.166
- Or at least call her.
- Not yet.

21:13.369 --> 21:15.280
We need Phoebe.

21:16.529 --> 21:18.326
What...?

21:25.369 --> 21:27.280
Oh, my God.

21:27.849 --> 21:30.124
- What's happening?
- We're changing back.

21:30.329 --> 21:31.682
The spell said this would happen.

21:31.969 --> 21:35.359
Look, Phoebe's not here, and there's
nothing we can do to change things.

21:35.569 --> 21:38.083
- It's not like we made up the rules.
- God, Tessa was right.

21:38.609 --> 21:40.042
We shouldn't have done this.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.645
She talked too much.

21:54.329 --> 21:56.638
What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.885
- Guys, stop. This isn't fun anymore.
- Yes, it is.

21:59.049 --> 22:00.562
Next time you want
a dangerous man,

22:00.729 --> 22:03.004
might wanna make sure
he's not poisonous.

22:08.969 --> 22:12.678
- Why'd you do that?
- Paper. Give me the paper.

22:15.089 --> 22:16.283
Are they...

22:16.449 --> 22:17.438
...dead?

22:17.609 --> 22:19.088
They will be.

22:19.249 --> 22:22.207
Wait a minute. Don't we need
both them and Phoebe for the spell?

22:22.409 --> 22:25.003
- That's how it worked before.
- Four hours until we turn back.

22:25.529 --> 22:27.520
Four hours until they die
from the poison.

22:28.809 --> 22:31.687
I think that information might motivate
this Phoebe to help us.

22:38.769 --> 22:40.839
Her scent, it's everywhere.

22:42.169 --> 22:45.241
- But she's not here right now.
- Let's go home, okay, guys?

22:45.409 --> 22:49.925
I've had enough.
We're not meant to be like this.

22:54.009 --> 22:55.567
What?

22:56.849 --> 22:59.727
Come on, guys, what? No.

22:59.929 --> 23:03.126
Not me. Guys, stop. No! No! No!

23:08.049 --> 23:10.199
I didn't think he'd ever shut up.

23:12.409 --> 23:15.162
So since when can mortals
cast spells that actually work?

23:15.329 --> 23:19.004
Look, I know that that book is probably
a total cheese-fest, but what if?

23:19.169 --> 23:21.603
I mean, the spell called for
living objects, my premonition

23:21.769 --> 23:24.158
and that guy who could leap
tall buildings in a single bound?

23:24.329 --> 23:26.718
Something is wrong, I know it.

23:28.489 --> 23:29.717
Higher education.

23:29.889 --> 23:32.084
Maybe I need to come back
to college to study something.

23:32.249 --> 23:33.238
- Oh, Ethan.
- Hey.

23:33.409 --> 23:37.038
- What happened, honey?
- Oh, it's nothing. Some drunk frat guy.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.801
Seems to be a lot of that
going around.

23:38.969 --> 23:40.641
This is my sister Prue.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.318
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.207
Well, I just knocked,
but nobody was in.

23:44.369 --> 23:46.360
Thought I'd give them hell
for missing section.

23:46.529 --> 23:48.201
Andrea and Brooke
would totally bail,

23:48.409 --> 23:50.764
but it doesn't really seem
like Tessa, you know?

23:51.209 --> 23:53.325
It is Valentine's Day.
Maybe they had something to do.

23:53.489 --> 23:55.161
Do you?

23:55.809 --> 23:58.277
Okay, gotta go. Busy, busy.
Nice meeting you, Ethan.

23:58.489 --> 24:00.320
Nice to meet you,
and I'll see you tonight.

24:00.489 --> 24:01.763
Okay.

24:01.929 --> 24:03.123
All right.

24:03.289 --> 24:04.768
- Back!
- Okay.

24:04.929 --> 24:06.567
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Well, you're right.

24:06.729 --> 24:08.845
Love takes a back seat to duty.

24:09.009 --> 24:11.443
What's that about love
in the back seat? Because...

24:12.649 --> 24:14.719
...Mom, Dad, your birth.

24:14.889 --> 24:17.084
- That's disgusting.
- Sort of how you were...

24:17.249 --> 24:20.286
My God, this place is a mess.

24:20.449 --> 24:24.601
I mean, I know that boys are bad,
but this is a pigsty.

24:24.769 --> 24:26.646
I don't think they did this.

24:26.809 --> 24:29.482
- Hey, is this the spell book?
- Yeah.

24:31.529 --> 24:34.566
- What was that?
- It's in the closet.

24:52.249 --> 24:55.605
Look, Tessa, I know what you've
been through has been really hard,

24:55.769 --> 24:58.647
but the only way that we can help you
is if you tell us what happened.

24:59.009 --> 25:01.204
There's no way
that you'd understand.

25:01.689 --> 25:04.999
You won't find two more understanding
people in this particular instance.

25:05.369 --> 25:07.599
It just sounds so crazy,
and you're gonna think that I'm...

25:07.769 --> 25:10.158
Very brave for facing whatever it is.

25:13.089 --> 25:16.399
You remember that spell
that we showed you in class?

25:16.609 --> 25:18.247
Well, it worked.

25:18.409 --> 25:20.286
Not like it helped us meet guys,

25:20.449 --> 25:22.201
it helped us make guys
out of animals.

25:22.849 --> 25:24.680
And you did this
from the spell in that book?

25:25.009 --> 25:27.728
Yeah, and we even played back the
tape that we were recording in class

25:27.889 --> 25:29.686
so we could hear your corrections
to the spell.

25:29.849 --> 25:31.840
But before we had a chance
to chant the new version,

25:32.009 --> 25:33.806
I mean, there they were.

25:33.969 --> 25:36.437
All right, so what is it that you think
these men want with you?

25:36.649 --> 25:38.207
I don't know.

25:38.369 --> 25:41.520
Maybe it's our fault because we tried to
make them into something they're not.

25:41.689 --> 25:44.328
No, you can't blame yourself
for the actions of other people.

25:44.729 --> 25:47.721
We're gonna fix this.
First, we have to fix you.

25:47.889 --> 25:49.527
I'll be right back.

25:53.889 --> 25:57.598
If I were hydrogen peroxide,
where would I be?

26:08.889 --> 26:10.208
- Phoebe?
- Prue, where do we keep

26:10.369 --> 26:12.564
the hydrogen peroxide?

26:22.969 --> 26:24.448
Oh, my God.

26:24.609 --> 26:26.884
He was one of them,
except he didn't look like that.

26:27.089 --> 26:29.683
- The spell must be wearing off.
- They're starting to look and act

26:29.849 --> 26:32.568
- more like animals.
- Look, they've killed one of their own.

26:32.729 --> 26:36.005
There's no telling what they'll do
or what they've done to your friends.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.927
- Do you know what they want?
- You.

26:38.489 --> 26:39.717
- What?
- They're having fun,

26:39.889 --> 26:43.040
and they wanna stay this way. Andrea
told them you'd be able to help them.

26:43.209 --> 26:45.165
Okay, where are they now?

26:47.609 --> 26:49.247
There.

26:50.769 --> 26:52.168
That's where they think you'll be.

26:59.249 --> 27:00.887
Hey. Hey.

27:07.729 --> 27:10.038
- You guys need some help?
- You could say that.

27:10.209 --> 27:13.087
- I think we're out of gas.
- What can I do for you?

27:14.929 --> 27:17.079
Well, you could not scream.

27:29.849 --> 27:33.808
Okay, ladies, Papa's got
a brand-new set of wheels.

27:35.129 --> 27:36.721
Prue, the place is full of snakes.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.847
How am I supposed to pick out
the right one?

27:40.009 --> 27:43.524
Did I mention I have
dinner plans with Dan?

27:43.969 --> 27:47.723
Okay, you're five minutes away? Okay,
as fast as you can would be good.

27:47.889 --> 27:49.447
- Everything okay?
- Of course not.

27:49.609 --> 27:51.998
Prue and Phoebe have found
a problem. Two of them, actually.

27:52.169 --> 27:53.921
And they're bringing their dates here.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.603
On a night when you have
a date of your own, huh?

27:57.329 --> 27:58.967
Just earmark anyone
looking for Phoebe.

27:59.129 --> 28:00.881
They're coming here
to try and find her.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.682
Excuse me,
you wouldn't happen to know

28:04.849 --> 28:07.079
if Phoebe Halliwell is anywhere
around here, would you?

28:07.689 --> 28:10.328
She should be here any minute,
and if you sit down and don't move,

28:10.529 --> 28:11.757
you'll have a perfect view.

28:20.369 --> 28:22.246
You think he's...?

28:22.409 --> 28:24.240
- Could be.
- Let me help.

28:25.009 --> 28:26.681
No, Leo. Thank you,

28:26.849 --> 28:30.285
but now that you've lost your wings,

28:30.449 --> 28:32.246
I don't want you to get hurt.

28:43.529 --> 28:45.201
Hey.

28:45.489 --> 28:48.287
- You my Valentine?
- I hope so.

28:48.449 --> 28:50.519
- Especially after...
- Today.

28:50.809 --> 28:52.242
Well, tonight's tonight.

28:53.529 --> 28:54.757
So let's get started.

28:55.849 --> 28:57.601
About that.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.327
You're kidding.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.207
Just tell me you're kidding.

29:01.409 --> 29:03.445
- What?
- Wait, let me guess.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.839
It's something with your sisters.
Or maybe you'll be vague

29:06.009 --> 29:07.920
and just say,
"Something important's come up."

29:08.249 --> 29:10.444
Or my favourite of all time,

29:10.609 --> 29:12.520
"It's a matter of life and death."

29:13.249 --> 29:16.400
Actually, what I was going to say,
if you would let me,

29:16.569 --> 29:17.968
is that I'm running a little late,

29:18.129 --> 29:19.801
and could you please
wait for me at the bar?

29:34.449 --> 29:35.962
Phoebe?

29:38.689 --> 29:40.486
Are you okay?

29:43.609 --> 29:44.837
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

29:45.009 --> 29:46.681
Piper's destressing in the alcove.

29:47.649 --> 29:50.959
Tessa, Leo. Leo, Tessa. Can you
watch her for us for a little while?

29:51.249 --> 29:52.887
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

29:53.049 --> 29:55.244
- How's the spell coming?
- It'd be coming a lot better

29:55.449 --> 29:57.041
if I had a pinch of the salt of life.

29:57.489 --> 29:59.639
- We got the salt of margarita.
- I will take it.

29:59.849 --> 30:04.286
On this day of love,
let's show a little for Janice Robinson.

30:04.649 --> 30:06.287
So who are you?

30:06.489 --> 30:08.241
I'm...

30:09.449 --> 30:11.201
...just a friend.

30:35.009 --> 30:37.443
Hey, how's my stressed-out sister
and her something?

30:37.609 --> 30:40.442
Well, we've moved past "something"
and straight into "everything."

30:40.609 --> 30:43.919
The view sucks. I don't recommend it.
How goes the battle plan?

30:44.129 --> 30:45.767
We didn't find anything
in the Book of Shadows.

30:46.009 --> 30:48.603
Which makes sense,
because the ani-men or whatever

30:48.769 --> 30:51.602
were created by careless magic,
not supernatural evil.

30:52.009 --> 30:53.761
- So where does that leave us?
- In the hands

30:53.929 --> 30:56.363
of our spellbinding sister,
who's writing a little hocus-pocus

30:56.529 --> 30:57.882
to turn these men back into animals

30:58.049 --> 30:59.687
before they get
completely out of control.

30:59.889 --> 31:02.483
Easier said than done.
I do not work well under pressure.

31:02.649 --> 31:05.288
- Any sign of them?
- Well, I've been watching that one,

31:05.449 --> 31:09.044
who came in looking for Phoebe,
but he doesn't seem so creepy.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.929
Yeah, the only magic Phoebe
wants to work on him is personal.

31:12.089 --> 31:14.000
That's her date.

31:14.209 --> 31:16.803
Why do we seem to have a habit
of gathering our men

31:16.969 --> 31:18.846
at the scene
of a supernatural smackdown?

31:19.249 --> 31:21.524
- It's part of our charm.
- Hey, ladies.

31:22.329 --> 31:24.365
Hey, Darryl, please tell me
you're here

31:24.529 --> 31:26.565
for a nice romantic evening
with your wife.

31:26.769 --> 31:28.566
No, that would be what I'm late for.

31:28.969 --> 31:30.960
- Join the club.
- I'm here as a friend.

31:31.129 --> 31:34.280
It's not my case, but I've heard a buzz.
String of violent crimes from campus,

31:34.489 --> 31:36.957
through your neighbourhood,
all the way here to the parking lot.

31:37.249 --> 31:39.399
Stolen blue Grand Marq
the assailants were driving?

31:39.569 --> 31:42.367
Parked outside.
Couple of units are on the way, so...

31:42.969 --> 31:45.244
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- I'll warn security.

31:49.609 --> 31:51.167
- Here.
- Oh, thanks, Leo.

31:51.569 --> 31:53.685
Tessa says Andrea
and Brooke aren't here.

31:53.889 --> 31:55.163
But they are.

32:00.209 --> 32:03.087
Phoebe. So nice to smell you.

32:03.249 --> 32:04.887
He just spotted me.

32:09.089 --> 32:11.239
- How are we doing on that spell?
- You keep throwing

32:11.409 --> 32:14.481
this "we" word around,
and I don't see you doing anything.

32:16.609 --> 32:18.201
- Wait.
- Darryl, no.

32:22.529 --> 32:24.121
Darryl, wait.

32:24.329 --> 32:26.081
Okay, I got it.

32:29.969 --> 32:33.405
Make us human, or by the time
you find your friends, they'll be dead.

32:34.689 --> 32:37.328
Something wicked in our midst

32:37.489 --> 32:39.844
In human form, these spirits dwell

32:40.049 --> 32:41.243
Phoebe, no.

32:42.569 --> 32:45.367
Make them animals sayeth the spell

32:47.329 --> 32:48.967
Phoebe, they hid the girls.

32:49.169 --> 32:52.479
Okay, we need to keep them human
until we find out where they are.

32:58.249 --> 33:01.047
- Okay, what's going on?
- The good news...

33:01.209 --> 33:02.483
...is the spell worked.

33:02.649 --> 33:03.684
And the bad news?

33:03.889 --> 33:05.800
The spell worked on everyone.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.603
I don't have a permit
for this kind of party.

33:32.369 --> 33:34.246
Old MacPiper had a farm

33:34.449 --> 33:35.882
E-l-E-I...

33:36.049 --> 33:37.687
Was that a moo?

33:38.969 --> 33:42.359
- Phoebe, fix this.
- Rome was not built in a day, Piper.

33:42.849 --> 33:46.000
Yeah, but my club was ruined
in the blink of an eye.

33:46.209 --> 33:49.201
At least we don't have to try and figure
out what species our innocents are.

33:49.409 --> 33:52.128
Yeah, but if Tessa's right,
and they're not here, then what?

33:52.289 --> 33:53.927
Well, right before you cast the spell,

33:54.089 --> 33:57.206
the snake said something about,
if we don't make them human,

33:57.369 --> 34:00.042
- then the girls will die.
- So how much time do we have?

34:00.249 --> 34:03.798
Tessa said the spell lasts for 24 hours,
and they cast it at midnight, so...

34:03.969 --> 34:05.402
That's in 35 minutes.

34:05.569 --> 34:08.561
Didn't Morris say something about
the men's stolen car parked outside?

34:08.728 --> 34:11.038
Yeah, followed by...

34:11.569 --> 34:13.685
...the police, who are
on their way here right now.

34:13.889 --> 34:15.958
Okay, you know, I made this mess,
let me clean it up.

34:16.129 --> 34:18.962
You have to find Brooke and Andrea,
because if my premonition was right,

34:19.369 --> 34:22.121
- As they always are.
- They were both bitten by that snake,

34:22.329 --> 34:24.842
which means if they don't get
medical attention, they could die.

34:25.009 --> 34:27.920
We'll go try and find something
in the car that will lead us to them.

34:28.129 --> 34:29.960
Okay, Phoebe,
you try and turn this room back,

34:30.129 --> 34:31.801
and we will try to find the girls, and...

34:33.289 --> 34:35.199
Go kiss someone else.

34:35.929 --> 34:38.920
Let's take these guys with us,
make sure they don't turn human.

34:39.089 --> 34:40.841
Are you sure we got the right ones?

34:41.009 --> 34:43.284
Yeah, it was the only
rabbit and snake next to each other.

34:43.688 --> 34:46.078
And the only two that put up a fight.

34:47.609 --> 34:48.962
Whoa, they're fleeing.

34:50.728 --> 34:52.879
Piper, how about
a little supernatural corral.

34:56.049 --> 34:57.562
Thank you.

34:58.009 --> 35:01.718
Okay. I would like you all to know
that I am vegetarian, okay?

35:01.889 --> 35:04.164
I have never eaten any of you.

35:05.009 --> 35:06.806
Why do I have to carry
the poisonous snake?

35:06.969 --> 35:08.561
- Because you're the oldest.
- So?

35:08.729 --> 35:11.004
So you've lived a full life.

35:11.169 --> 35:12.761
Wait, you think that's the car
over there?

35:12.929 --> 35:14.647
What, do you want me to ask them?

35:14.809 --> 35:17.960
You know what? You're a smartass.
Come on, we don't have much time.

35:25.369 --> 35:27.280
No. Bad dog!

35:27.449 --> 35:29.565
Lxnay on the icking-lay.

35:30.769 --> 35:32.600
You know what?
Nobody bothers the witch, okay?

35:32.769 --> 35:35.237
If we all remain calm,
I will have everything under control

35:35.409 --> 35:36.967
and back to normal, all right?

35:37.889 --> 35:40.642
- Nothing. Now what?
- Trunk.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.077
Oh, my God.

35:46.569 --> 35:48.924
They have a pulse.
It's still there, but it's faint.

35:49.089 --> 35:51.603
- We need to get them to the hospital.
- All right.

35:52.049 --> 35:56.281
Undo the magic acted here
Reverse the spell so all is clear

36:08.889 --> 36:11.084
Back off, Thumper.

36:12.329 --> 36:14.365
- What's happening?
- Phoebe reversed the spell.

36:14.529 --> 36:16.087
- Piper, hold on.
- What do you mean?

36:31.369 --> 36:32.882
How's it feel to be a man now?

36:43.329 --> 36:46.526
What do you say we wake up
Dr Poison here and move him...?

36:46.689 --> 36:48.805
Move Thumper there
right into his fangs?

36:48.969 --> 36:50.482
I've got a better idea.

36:50.649 --> 36:52.207
Come on.

36:58.729 --> 37:00.924
Well, at least we're human
for good now.

37:01.089 --> 37:02.727
Shut up.

37:05.049 --> 37:07.324
So it looks like they got
what they wanted.

37:07.489 --> 37:09.002
They get to be treated like humans.

37:09.169 --> 37:10.682
And caged like them too.

37:10.849 --> 37:13.283
You three sure are rewriting
my book on public service.

37:13.609 --> 37:15.281
- So the girls are gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

37:15.569 --> 37:19.278
They're on the way to the hospital.
I think you found them just in time.

37:19.729 --> 37:21.401
How did...?

37:23.889 --> 37:25.208
I'm not gonna even ask.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.360
Remember when our biggest
concern on Valentine's Day

37:27.529 --> 37:29.121
was who to spend it with?

37:29.329 --> 37:30.603
Still is.

37:30.769 --> 37:32.521
Yeah, maybe for you.

37:32.689 --> 37:34.805
I was dateless tonight.

37:34.969 --> 37:38.279
Oh, speaking of dates,
don't I have one in there?

38:01.849 --> 38:05.364
You know, I never knew how
exhausting not having a job could be.

38:05.529 --> 38:09.488
- Table four needs to be bussed.
- Okay, I'm serious.

38:09.649 --> 38:13.244
It's like having a job sort of made this
whole charmed thing less stressful.

38:13.409 --> 38:15.320
It gave me something else
to worry about.

38:15.489 --> 38:18.287
So the Prue of old wins out after all.

38:18.449 --> 38:20.041
I like being busy.

38:20.209 --> 38:21.801
Then why mess with a good thing?

38:21.969 --> 38:25.325
Yeah, I just need to find something
that I love getting busy at.

38:25.489 --> 38:28.765
Speaking of getting busy,
check out our little sister.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.442
Oh, my.

38:32.809 --> 38:34.925
Let's just hope
she doesn't do '80s dancing.

38:35.089 --> 38:38.001
Time to go home. Bye.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.327
Stick around.
Janice Robinson will be back

38:40.489 --> 38:42.445
with her second set
after a short break.

38:42.609 --> 38:45.282
- Phoebe, there's something...
- Oh, no. In my teeth?

38:45.489 --> 38:47.002
Oh, no.

38:49.889 --> 38:53.006
That's... That's...
That's really strange.

38:59.089 --> 39:01.080
You're not a beck-and-call
kind of girl. I get that.

39:01.249 --> 39:04.047
I have a job that takes time,
a family that takes time,

39:04.209 --> 39:07.087
and making you and me work
is gonna take time.

39:07.289 --> 39:09.041
I need to know
you're willing to deal with it.

39:09.209 --> 39:12.440
You know I am,
as long as you realize who I am.

39:13.729 --> 39:15.720
Sometimes I...

39:17.169 --> 39:20.559
I get jealous. I wonder where you are
and who you're with, and that's me.

39:20.769 --> 39:23.203
But you can't make me
something I'm not.

39:23.369 --> 39:24.848
Work with me, yes, but change me...

39:26.609 --> 39:28.247
Relationships are hard work.

39:29.089 --> 39:30.647
Especially on an empty stomach.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.603
You think we can talk about this
over dinner?

39:33.809 --> 39:35.037
Magic words.

39:39.129 --> 39:41.120
Oh, I forgot my purse.
I'll meet you outside.

39:41.289 --> 39:42.927
Okay.

40:00.329 --> 40:05.005
Piper, when we first met,
you thought I was just a handyman.

40:05.209 --> 40:08.963
Well, I'm a handyman again.
Same guy you fell in love with.

40:09.129 --> 40:12.678
The same guy who fell in love
with you for who you are.

40:12.849 --> 40:15.488
Remember that,
and know that I'm not giving up.
