That which is done out of love
always takes place beyond good and evil.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.486
Yeah. Have my helicopter ready
first thing in the morning.

00:26.659 --> 00:28.627
I'm going back to Metropolis.

00:28.795 --> 00:32.026
No, no, I'll be alone. I suspect...

00:32.198 --> 00:36.100
...Martha Kent is no longer in my employ.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.837
Who's there?

00:49.582 --> 00:53.018
If this is someone's idea of a joke,
I'm not amused.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.385
Is that you?

01:04.030 --> 01:08.023
Didn't I make it clear,
the conversation is over.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.319
Jonathan Kent...

02:01.788 --> 02:05.053
...put the gun down
and step out of the truck.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.428
Keep your hands where I can see them.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.030
Drop it.

02:13.399 --> 02:15.026
Away from the vehicle, sir.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.795
Away from the vehicle!

02:23.943 --> 02:28.277
Everything's gonna be fine. Just keep
your hands where we can see them.

02:30.049 --> 02:31.311
Ethan.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.214
- What's going on?
- Jonathan...

02:34.387 --> 02:38.881
...as a friend, don't say another word
until you get yourself a lawyer.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.763
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

02:47.934 --> 02:51.665
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.934
You have the right to consult an attorney
and to have an attorney present...

03:57.870 --> 04:00.566
Dad, how are you doing?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.903
I'm fine, other than a splitting headache.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.942
Any word on how Lionel Luthor's doing?

04:06.112 --> 04:09.707
He was rushed into surgery, Jonathan.
He may not make it.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.578
How about the gun they found
in my truck?

04:12.752 --> 04:16.449
Well, the police are testing it now.
It's the same caliber Lionel was shot with.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.784
Clark, that was not my gun.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.324
I have no idea how it wound up
in my hands.

04:21.961 --> 04:26.694
- Dad, what happened last night?
- Well, I was out running some errands.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.164
I stopped by the Wild Coyote for a beer.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.837
When I got in my truck,
everything started to go woozy on me.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.042
How many did you have?

04:41.214 --> 04:42.806
Martha, I had half a beer.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.974
I promise, but...

04:45.485 --> 04:48.613
...next thing I know, I'm out on the side
of Highway 91. I got...

04:48.788 --> 04:51.484
...the police spotlight shining
in my face, it's raining.

04:51.658 --> 04:55.924
We need to get a lawyer. I'm going to call
my father and ask him to take your case.

04:56.095 --> 04:59.963
Martha, that man has never believed
in me before. I don't see why...

05:00.133 --> 05:03.034
...an attempted-murder charge
is gonna change that.

05:13.246 --> 05:17.080
Sorry, Martha, but you and Clark
are gonna have to leave now.

05:27.894 --> 05:31.386
Dad, no matter what it takes,
I'm gonna find out who did this.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.891
Yeah.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.775
I just got in from Metropolis.
Where is he?

05:53.953 --> 05:57.047
In surgery. He's still in critical condition.

05:57.223 --> 06:01.284
If the downstairs maid hadn't been
awakened by the shot, he'd be dead.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.919
I want round-the-clock security.
Whoever shot him might still be out there.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.000
You can save the concerned-son routine,
Lex. I have everything under control.

06:10.203 --> 06:15.800
The loyal lap dog sitting watch at master's
door, secretly hoping he doesn't make it?

06:16.976 --> 06:20.207
As I recall, you almost let him die once.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.814
Who's to say you didn't
try to finish the job?

06:23.182 --> 06:25.742
God knows, after yesterday...

06:26.152 --> 06:28.245
...you'd have enough reason
to want him dead.

06:31.357 --> 06:36.158
You know what I find so amusing, is you
actually believe my father is grooming you.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.128
It's unfortunate that they already
have a suspect in custody.

06:45.705 --> 06:51.268
I can't think of a person with a better
motive for killing your father than you.

06:58.451 --> 07:02.217
I'm sorry about your father, Clark,
but I'm afraid I can't represent him.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.379
I don't understand. Why?

07:05.024 --> 07:06.821
I'm not the right man for this case.

07:06.993 --> 07:10.019
From everything I know about you,
you're perfect for this case.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.790
- I can make some referrals.
- They don't need a list of names.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.694
They need someone they can trust.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.698
I'm sorry, Lana.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.369
My decision's final.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.338
Just when I thought I was
getting to know him.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.744
Looks like we need to find another lawyer.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.346
Clark...

07:33.853 --> 07:36.014
...there's something I have to tell you.

07:39.926 --> 07:45.125
I went by the mansion yesterday to drop off
the Talon's quarterly tax bills, and...

07:45.798 --> 07:47.026
...your dad was there.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.196
What was he doing?

07:49.368 --> 07:51.359
Yelling at Lionel Luthor.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.903
No, I want you out of our lives,
once and for all.

07:54.073 --> 07:58.100
You're jumping to conclusions, Mr. Kent.
It was simply a token of appreciation.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.245
I think it was quite a bit more than that.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.176
It's all relative, isn't it?

08:02.348 --> 08:06.011
I mean, a Roger Dubuis watch
from me is equivalent...

08:06.185 --> 08:08.380
...to a Whitman's Sampler from you.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.050
Condescending son of a...

08:12.225 --> 08:15.683
The worst thing that happened to my family
was getting involved with yours.

08:15.862 --> 08:20.959
Oh, now, I seem to recall that the benefits
to our families were mutual.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.795
Are you forgetting the circumstances
of Clark's adoption?

08:24.203 --> 08:25.932
You poison everything you touch.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.537
This town would be better off
if you weren't in it.

08:28.708 --> 08:32.144
But you're as much to blame for that
as I am, aren't you?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.309
Martha was worried about that.

08:35.481 --> 08:40.316
She thought you wouldn't be big enough
to let her live her own life.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.544
You stay away from Martha...

08:42.722 --> 08:45.486
...or I promise you, you will regret it.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.686
He threatened him, Clark.

08:50.229 --> 08:53.289
My dad told me he was running errands.
Why would he lie to me?

08:53.466 --> 08:56.629
Look, the sheriff came by earlier...

08:57.436 --> 08:59.336
...I told him what I just told you.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.404
I didn't want to, but I couldn't lie.

09:03.743 --> 09:07.509
It's okay. I mean, you know my dad
would never try to kill anybody.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.011
Right?

09:09.682 --> 09:13.618
He was angry, Clark, but I know him.
And there's no way.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.754
Thanks.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.234
Mom?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.238
What's going on?

09:38.177 --> 09:40.441
They have a search warrant.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.546
- Martha, can I have a word with you?
- Yeah.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.185
Found this watch on your bedroom floor.
Is it yours?

09:48.287 --> 09:49.879
It was a gift.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.284
From who?

09:56.896 --> 09:58.363
Lionel Luthor.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.671
"To Martha, with deepest affection, L.L."

10:06.839 --> 10:08.500
I was gonna give it back.

10:09.508 --> 10:12.170
I knew if Jonathan saw it,
he would be furious...

10:13.879 --> 10:17.679
...so I hid it in my dresser.
- Well, looks like he found it.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.244
Ethan, you've known Jonathan
since high school.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.022
I can't let my friendship
interfere with my job.

10:26.492 --> 10:30.485
- You gotta admit, this looks like motive.
- He found a watch and smashed it.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.153
That doesn't mean he's a killer.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.166
He also had an argument
with Lionel yesterday.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.234
- What?
- Yeah.

10:37.403 --> 10:38.836
Lana was there. She saw it.

10:39.005 --> 10:43.032
It was so heated, one of Lionel's assistants
called about getting a restraining order.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.941
Way I figure, he was still hot under the
collar when he got to the Wild Coyote.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.877
Bartender told me he got pretty drunk.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.251
Hey, Mike...

10:58.424 --> 11:01.052
...why don't you give me a double shot
of that tequila?

11:11.971 --> 11:14.030
Wait a minute, Dad said
he only had one beer.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.797
I administered his blood-alcohol
test myself, son.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.043
He was at 2.0.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.577
That's quite a bit more than one beer.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.848
From the sound of things,
he was really spoiling for a fight.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.146
Lionel Luthor's a lying, miserable
son of a bitch.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.989
You won't get any arguments here.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.930
- Again.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.999
All right, then why don't you
sell me the whole bottle.

11:48.808 --> 11:52.574
- I'm not supposed to do that, Jonathan.
- Come on, Mike.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.940
I know we've been friends a long time.

11:56.615 --> 11:57.843
Nobody's gonna know.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.278
Is that you?

12:33.853 --> 12:38.051
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.335
We have eyewitnesses...

13:01.514 --> 13:04.915
...who saw Jonathan's truck leaving
the mansion after they heard gunshots.

13:05.251 --> 13:08.049
Forensics found powder residue
on Jonathan's hand.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.189
I wish there were another explanation.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.857
But now he's our only suspect.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.035
What exactly are we looking for?

13:26.338 --> 13:28.898
The police already checked this whole area.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.737
Yeah, we have an advantage they don't.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.946
Are you doing the eye thing?

13:39.118 --> 13:41.450
Hey, I need you to check
my back yard sometime.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.919
I buried a jar of quarters when I was 10.
Never could find it.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.786
They found my dad's truck
right about here.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.936
Did you find something?

14:03.108 --> 14:04.541
Yeah, it's a bullet.

14:05.644 --> 14:08.272
We need to get the sheriff
out here to dig it out.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.648
I don't mean to rain on
your CSI parade...

14:13.819 --> 14:16.720
...but the only thing that proves
is that somebody shot a shed.

14:16.889 --> 14:20.256
The sheriff said he found powder residue
on my dad's hand.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.860
My dad said he'd never
seen that gun before.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.825
So? What does that mean?

14:24.997 --> 14:28.626
Whoever shot Lionel drugged my dad
and followed him until he pulled over.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.206
If that bullet came from the gun
that shot Lionel...

14:36.375 --> 14:39.902
...maybe we can convince the police
that my dad is being framed.

14:47.853 --> 14:52.051
Even though we removed the bullet,
the kidney damage slowed his metabolism.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.953
He's in a coma.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.354
What are his chances?

14:56.629 --> 14:58.688
His higher brain functions
are shutting down.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.928
If he doesn't regain consciousness
in the next 24 hours...

15:02.635 --> 15:05.126
...he won't make it. I'm sorry.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.838
Sheriff Ethan...

15:10.542 --> 15:13.375
...can I talk to you for a minute?
- Excuse me, sheriff.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.476
What is it, Clark?

15:18.050 --> 15:20.746
I found a bullet in the shack
where you arrested my father.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.281
My men went over that area
with a microscope.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.150
Well, they must have missed it.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.885
Someone put that gun in my dad's hand
and fired it.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.996
Or he squeezed off a round while he was
parked there drinking...

15:32.164 --> 15:34.132
...or it could be from a different weapon.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.565
Whoever's trying to set up my dad
doesn't want you to find that bullet.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.432
I don't know what it'll prove,
but I'll have it tested.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.507
Sheriff, I was wondering if we could talk.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.474
My name's Dominic Santori.
I work for Lionel Luthor.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.009
- Clark, would you excuse us?
- It's okay. He can stay.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.184
I don't think his father shot Mr. Luthor.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.456
But I'm pretty sure I know who did.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.450
All right, Lex...

16:02.628 --> 16:05.961
...what's so urgent that you insisted
I fly in for a face-to-face.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.292
I'm missing Domingo's La Boheme.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.865
Well, consider this a curtain call
on our own private opera, Dad.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.103
Would you ask your Seeing Eye dog
to wait outside?

16:16.408 --> 16:20.538
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of Dominic.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.508
A representative from
an offshore shell company...

16:25.551 --> 16:28.884
...who bears an uncanny resemblance
to Mr. Santori here...

16:29.054 --> 16:32.888
...has been quietly approaching LexCorp
employees and buying their voting shares.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.193
Is that so?

16:36.495 --> 16:39.259
I was under the impression
they had no intention of selling.

16:39.431 --> 16:40.659
What'd you get on them?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.631
Now, now, Lex, don't be a sore loser.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.370
I'm just realigning your priorities.

16:46.538 --> 16:50.133
Your attempt to build LexCorp
was at the expense of our mutual goals.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.712
The only thing we share
is a mutual enmity.

16:56.715 --> 17:02.153
This father-son reconciliation act was just
a smoke screen to buy out my company.

17:02.321 --> 17:06.451
If you were ready to run LexCorp, there's
no way I could have taken it from you.

17:06.925 --> 17:11.191
Look at this as an opportunity for us
to work together again, father and son.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.263
When I broke away, I swore I'd
never be under your thumb again.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.868
It was my hope that you'll stay
and rise to the challenge.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.001
Your ego wouldn't allow it.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.037
I'll fight you on this, and I'll win.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.699
You better have something stronger
than words to back up those threats...

17:25.877 --> 17:30.611
...because as of this moment,
you are just another employee.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.053
All Lex had to do
was wait until Lionel was alone.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.952
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

17:49.535 --> 17:53.699
After he shot him,
Lex could have framed Mr. Kent.

17:53.872 --> 17:58.707
And then he drove his girlfriend
to Metropolis, a convenient alibi.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.445
Thank you, Mr. Santori.
I'll certainly look into that.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.582
Excuse me.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.577
I know Lex and his dad have problems,
but it's hard to believe he'd do that.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.551
Face it, Clark, in your heart...

18:12.724 --> 18:15.750
...you've always known
what Lex is capable of.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.377
Hey.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.109
Are you okay?

18:39.251 --> 18:43.381
Sometimes being an objective journalist
really sucks.

18:43.722 --> 18:45.656
I can imagine.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.459
I still can't believe
Henry didn't take Mr. Kent's case.

18:52.898 --> 18:56.629
Okay, usually when I do this,
people seem to get really mad at me.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.636
But I found it odd that your dad passed up
an opportunity to take on a Luthor...

19:00.806 --> 19:04.298
...so I ran a search on his legal history.

19:05.043 --> 19:08.308
And since you don't seem to be
freaking out, I guess I should continue?

19:08.914 --> 19:12.645
If it helps explain why he won't
defend Mr. Kent, then I wanna know.

19:13.352 --> 19:19.018
Okay, it turns out that Mr. Small was
a top white-collar criminal defense lawyer.

19:19.358 --> 19:24.125
He and his firm did a lot of business
with, surprise, surprise, LuthorCorp.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.657
Maybe he considered the Kent case
a conflict of interest.

19:28.133 --> 19:31.500
As opposed to all the other times
he's taken on Lionel and his buddies?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.537
This is interesting, though.

19:34.706 --> 19:39.405
LuthorCorp filed a complaint against
Henry Small that got him fired from his firm.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.103
Okay, so that explains why
he might hate the Luthors...

19:42.281 --> 19:44.681
...but it doesn't explain
why he won't take the case.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.877
You know, Lana, my computer
only spits out cold, hard facts.

19:49.054 --> 19:52.990
If you want explanations,
you're gonna have to go to the source.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.324
I understand.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.852
Very well, doctor, keep me posted.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.163
Dominic told me you got in a fight
with your father before he got shot.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.132
Why didn't you tell the police?

20:05.571 --> 20:07.698
So now you're implying I pulled the trigger?

20:10.008 --> 20:12.533
It's not like I haven't seen you
shoot someone before.

20:13.111 --> 20:15.705
Get out of here before you
say something you'll regret.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.475
I'm not going anywhere,
not until I get some answers.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.277
Are you trying to frame my dad?

20:21.587 --> 20:25.717
After all this time, I thought you knew me
better than the average tabloid reader.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.519
If you don't start trusting me,
what else am I to think?

20:28.694 --> 20:30.218
Stay out of it, Clark.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.422
- My dad's life is at stake here.
- So is my father's!

20:36.568 --> 20:38.433
Goodbye, Clark.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.362
Sweetheart...

21:06.531 --> 21:08.089
...how are you holding up?

21:10.335 --> 21:13.202
You know, it's funny
how being locked up can...

21:13.372 --> 21:16.432
...give you time to reflect
on all the mistakes you've made.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.934
Why didn't you tell me
you had a fight with Lionel?

21:22.848 --> 21:25.146
- Because I was angry.
- At me?

21:26.718 --> 21:28.811
No, at myself.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.145
I was jealous.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.617
When I found that watch...

21:33.792 --> 21:36.488
...it reminded me of all the things
I couldn't give you.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.563
For the first time,
it felt like I was losing you.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.461
Martha, I am so sorry.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.363
For what?

21:55.681 --> 21:58.047
I'm sorry for not having faith in us.

21:59.851 --> 22:03.218
I'm sorry for giving in to my own petty fears.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.851
And all it takes is one...

22:07.025 --> 22:08.788
...reckless moment to ruin everything.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.690
Jonathan, you didn't shoot Lionel.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.096
No, I didn't shoot Lionel.

22:18.603 --> 22:20.070
But I...

22:21.540 --> 22:24.668
I let my anger get the best of me.

22:24.843 --> 22:29.246
I haven't exactly kept it a secret how
Jonathan Kent feels about the Luthors.

22:32.250 --> 22:35.276
What jury could possibly believe me now?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.516
I know this place.

22:41.693 --> 22:45.424
My brother used to come here all the time.
Word was they never checked IDs.

22:45.597 --> 22:46.928
How'd they keep it open?

22:47.099 --> 22:48.361
Good luck.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.932
Connections.

22:50.802 --> 22:54.932
Well, if someone did drug my dad, this
would have been the only place to do it.

23:05.951 --> 23:09.478
I don't know what you kids heard,
but we don't serve minors in here.

23:09.654 --> 23:13.488
I just want to ask a few questions.
My name's Clark Kent, Jonathan's son.

23:13.658 --> 23:15.216
Jonathan.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.059
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.

23:20.132 --> 23:23.260
Do you remember if he was
talking to anyone the other night?

23:23.435 --> 23:26.268
He was talking to everybody,
blowing off steam.

23:26.438 --> 23:29.896
Sounded like he had a major run-in
with Lionel Luthor.

23:31.843 --> 23:34.505
Sheriff said he bought
a bottle of tequila from you.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.211
Yeah, I wish I hadn't done it now.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.714
The cops want me to testify.

23:41.887 --> 23:44.117
I could lose my liquor license.

23:44.289 --> 23:48.225
He never drinks more than one or two beers.
Did someone put something in his drink?

23:48.393 --> 23:52.352
Nobody had to put anything in his drink
the way he was knocking them back.

23:53.999 --> 23:57.435
Listen, I know you don't
wanna hear this...

23:57.602 --> 24:01.060
...but Jonathan said he was gonna
take care of Lionel, once and for all.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.799
- He'd never say that.
- I've known him since high school.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.602
He's always had a temper.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.041
There's no doubt in my mind he did it.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.442
You're just as bad as your old man.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.245
Clark, let him go, man.

24:16.922 --> 24:19.322
Clark, let him go! Be cool.

24:31.670 --> 24:35.333
The guy's lying. He's involved. I think
he's the one who spiked my dad's drink.

24:35.507 --> 24:36.974
Clark, look, I'm on your side...

24:37.142 --> 24:40.600
...but putting a bartender through
spin cycle isn't the thing to do now.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.713
I know. I'm sorry.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.078
Pete, look out!

25:34.132 --> 25:36.692
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

25:43.975 --> 25:46.671
But you must have definitely
ticked someone off.

26:03.261 --> 26:06.059
Clark, I heard you had a narrow escape.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.459
What do you care?

26:07.632 --> 26:10.100
I think this may be connected
to my father's shooting.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.498
- I warned you to stay out of this, Clark.
- Why?

26:12.671 --> 26:15.401
- To control the situation?
- I'm not controlling anything.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.508
I don't know who to believe anymore.

26:18.810 --> 26:22.746
- Dominic made quite an impression.
- This isn't about Dominic.

26:23.882 --> 26:27.181
He's asked the hospital staff
to keep me away from my father.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.820
- Why do you think that is?
- Probably to protect him.

26:30.021 --> 26:31.386
Or himself.

26:32.891 --> 26:36.918
If my father regains consciousness,
he may be able to identify who shot him.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.794
You think Dominic's involved?

26:40.465 --> 26:41.989
Why would he turn against Lionel?

26:42.167 --> 26:45.762
Because the decision to buy out LexCorp
affects him as much as it does me.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.635
- Something stronger than words
to back up those threats, son...

26:49.808 --> 26:54.177
...because as of this moment,
you are just another employee.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.904
I'm going to Metropolis.

26:57.082 --> 27:00.518
When I get back, I want you gone.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.868
You never told me you wanted Lex back.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.599
I thought it was assumed.

27:25.210 --> 27:30.011
You know I care about this company. I can't
believe you're giving Lex another chance.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.149
I gave Lex a taste of independence...

27:32.317 --> 27:34.911
...to demonstrate the futility
of working against me.

27:35.086 --> 27:39.318
But I always intended to bring him
back into the fold.

27:39.491 --> 27:43.018
You made promises to me,
promises that I expect you to keep.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.262
You've been loyal, Dominic...

27:46.431 --> 27:49.264
...but Lex is blood.

27:49.434 --> 27:53.234
I've worked too long to let you
take everything away from me now.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.544
I forgot my keys.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.039
He was angry enough to shoot your father?

28:07.352 --> 28:11.152
Seizing the reins of a billion-dollar
corporation is a powerful incentive.

28:11.322 --> 28:13.415
All he needed was
someone to take the blame.

28:26.805 --> 28:29.638
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

28:29.808 --> 28:33.107
My father was shot the same day
he bought my company out from under me.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.872
While you were playing it close to the vest,
my father was in jail.

28:37.048 --> 28:41.712
- How long would you let him stay there?
- Until I knew for sure he didn't do it.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.114
Now I do.

28:43.288 --> 28:45.654
Look, the shooting is related
to the buyout.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.258
I needed the guilty party to make a mistake.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.892
Like trying to kill me and Pete?

28:59.337 --> 29:00.565
So, what now?

29:04.509 --> 29:05.737
Lana...

29:05.910 --> 29:08.435
...I got your message.
What's the urgency?

29:10.315 --> 29:13.011
I know about the complaint
Lionel Luthor filed against you.

29:14.786 --> 29:17.118
Have you been snooping into my past?

29:17.856 --> 29:21.485
I was curious to find out why you wouldn't
help one of my closest friends.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.524
And that gives you the right to pry?

29:23.895 --> 29:27.456
I'm your daughter. If we're gonna have
more than the same DNA in common...

29:27.632 --> 29:31.659
...we have to be honest with each other.
- I didn't ask you to barge into my life.

29:34.205 --> 29:38.437
Don't worry. You know,
I won't be imposing on you again.

29:45.884 --> 29:50.685
- Lionel Luthor has nothing to do with this.
- I saw the complaint.

29:50.855 --> 29:56.384
Payback after I refused to go along
with one of his ethically dubious schemes.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.223
Business as usual for LuthorCorp.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.566
You should have kept on digging.

30:05.036 --> 30:06.697
And what would I have found?

30:07.038 --> 30:10.496
Kansas v. Sutton,
a murder trial back in the early '90s.

30:11.876 --> 30:14.140
I don't understand.

30:15.013 --> 30:19.541
I was defense counsel, court-appointed,
which meant I didn't give a damn.

30:19.717 --> 30:24.416
Five years after conviction, his family has
evidence retested, proving he was innocent.

30:25.723 --> 30:28.157
So you were still able
to get him out, right?

30:29.427 --> 30:30.917
By then it was too late.

30:31.262 --> 30:33.696
He had been executed
three months before.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.767
After that, I hung it all up.

30:36.935 --> 30:41.235
Now I try to save the world
from my living room.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.708
But at least I know
nobody's gonna die because of me.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.310
I know you can't undo the past...

30:49.914 --> 30:52.178
...but you can't hide from it, either.

30:58.823 --> 31:01.758
Lana? What are you doing here?

31:01.926 --> 31:04.417
Just offering some moral support.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.894
Brought some reinforcements.

31:07.065 --> 31:10.000
- I'd like to handle your father's case.
- Of course.

31:10.168 --> 31:13.433
We need all the help we can get.
Thank you.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.935
How'd you get him to change his mind?

31:17.108 --> 31:21.272
We set the ground rules for our relationship,
and we promised to be honest...

31:21.446 --> 31:23.107
...no matter what.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.776
I've got a bail hearing set this afternoon.

31:27.952 --> 31:31.945
I'm sure with Jonathan's standing in the
community, we can have him out by supper.

31:32.123 --> 31:34.614
I just got good news from Lex.
His dad's doing better.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.451
- He's expected to regain consciousness.
- Oh, thank God.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.061
Dad, and if he does,
maybe he can ID the shooter.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.096
That's a big "if," given his blindness.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.099
Look, we're not out of the woods yet.

31:45.603 --> 31:49.334
Lex Luthor's alibi checks out,
but Dominic Santori's is flimsy.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.236
That should be good news for me.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.776
The bartender who could corroborate
his involvement has disappeared.

31:54.946 --> 31:58.609
Now, without him, it's gonna be hard
to keep your case from going to trial.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.192
Breaking and entering really necessary?

32:09.627 --> 32:12.152
- Thought the police checked this place out.
- Yeah.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.561
They checked out the area
where my dad was arrested too.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.963
I'm gonna look over here.

32:36.154 --> 32:38.179
Pete!

32:48.399 --> 32:52.130
Oh, man, talk about sleeping
with the fishes.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.437
I think I know who shot Lionel Luthor.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.386
Lex had his father moved to another floor.

33:50.895 --> 33:53.295
We put the word out
that Lionel was getting better...

33:53.464 --> 33:56.365
...guessing it would draw you out.

33:58.336 --> 34:00.065
Kept hoping I was wrong.

34:09.347 --> 34:12.612
- What the hell?
- You went to high school with my dad.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.547
So did Mike the bartender.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.882
You and Mike were more than friends.
You had a business arrangement.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.614
Clark, I can explain.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.954
Explain how a bar with
repeated violations stays open?

34:23.127 --> 34:26.563
Or how all the evidence conveniently
pointed toward my dad?

34:26.731 --> 34:29.632
You found out about my dad's fight,
and it all came together.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.867
Is that you?

35:07.004 --> 35:11.270
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

35:26.991 --> 35:29.221
You faked my dad's blood-alcohol test...

35:29.393 --> 35:32.453
...and when I started to check out
your story, you came after me.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.791
My dad trusted you.
How could you do that?

35:35.333 --> 35:38.393
Don't you see, Clark? It's not just about me.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.897
It's the Luthors. They're like a cancer...

35:42.073 --> 35:44.769
...destroying everything they touch.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.773
The Luthors didn't kill anyone.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.572
The Luthors didn't frame my dad.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.884
What have I done?

36:13.705 --> 36:16.173
Just wanted to make sure
your dad was doing all right.

36:17.242 --> 36:18.470
He says he is.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.202
You don't sound too convinced.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.943
I found this in the house.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.981
It's my dad's high-school yearbook.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.048
Him and Ethan were in the same class.

36:32.223 --> 36:33.884
"To Jonathan...

36:34.058 --> 36:36.925
...a great quarterback,
a better friend, Ethan."

36:39.030 --> 36:42.022
You grow up with someone,
you think you know them, but...

36:44.269 --> 36:47.363
...I mean, darkness like that
just doesn't come out of nowhere.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.670
I'm sorry about your company.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.106
What's gonna happen next?

36:58.283 --> 37:00.751
My father thinks
I'll go back to work for him.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.184
Will you?

37:04.389 --> 37:06.823
It's hard to imagine working for a man...

37:06.991 --> 37:11.485
...who can enrage four people to the point
where any of them had motive to kill him.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.327
Even you.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.540
You know that darkness
you were talking about?

37:23.708 --> 37:28.042
I'm not sure we're born with it. People
like my father find a way to bring it out.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.881
So are we okay?

37:36.220 --> 37:38.120
I wish I could help you with your father.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.688
I can take him.

38:02.146 --> 38:03.545
Dad.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.444
Son.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.449
I understand you've had a busy few days.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.220
In case you hadn't heard...

38:12.390 --> 38:16.656
...Ethan has been charged in the murder
of the bartender and the attempt on you.

38:20.131 --> 38:25.899
It truly is a sad day in Smallville.

38:27.505 --> 38:31.703
I'm sure some version of the truth
will come out sooner or later...

38:31.876 --> 38:33.969
...but I was hoping to hear it
from you first.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.614
The sheriff and I simply...

38:42.453 --> 38:45.684
...had a misunderstanding.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.593
Sheriff.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.601
You have something for me?

39:04.842 --> 39:07.242
These are good people who happened
to make mistakes.

39:07.412 --> 39:10.711
Yes, well, we're, all of us,
only human, sheriff.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.974
These particular people sit on the board
of my son's company...

39:14.152 --> 39:17.519
...so they need a little incentive
to sell their voting shares to me.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.091
- Goodbye, Mr. Luthor.
- I hope this will be...

39:22.260 --> 39:25.388
...the beginning of a long
and profitable relationship.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.199
Our arrangement was for this one time only.

39:32.503 --> 39:38.965
Now, did that proviso come before
or after you insisted on cash in advance?

39:40.545 --> 39:42.012
I was strapped.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.647
But don't think you own me.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.045
I've documented your backroom deals.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.084
You push me, and I just have
to make one call.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.153
Would that be to your attorney?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.617
He...

39:53.224 --> 39:56.489
...passed along your documented evidence.

39:58.362 --> 40:00.557
Along with his best wishes.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.065
You know...

40:03.234 --> 40:06.362
...my reputation in Smallville is...

40:06.804 --> 40:09.364
...of no importance to me...

40:09.540 --> 40:10.973
...but yours...

40:11.642 --> 40:14.770
...it's your lifeblood, sheriff.

40:16.047 --> 40:20.711
Sheriff? That's an elected position,
isn't it?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.913
Don't threaten me, you son of a bitch.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.550
Good evening, sheriff.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.044
So you took an honest man
and destroyed him...

40:48.212 --> 40:51.807
...and by proxy
almost ruined Jonathan Kent.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.816
How does it feel, Dad,
knowing you brought this on yourself?

40:55.186 --> 40:57.154
But I didn't, Lex.

40:57.321 --> 40:59.414
You did...

40:59.590 --> 41:04.618
...engineering your
ill-advised employee coup.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.494
And you actually believe that?

41:13.838 --> 41:15.703
It's all right, son.

41:15.873 --> 41:17.272
I forgive you.

41:18.876 --> 41:21.811
Now it's time to look to the future.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.513
Together.

41:26.305 --> 41:32.592
