he fucks around

11:29.856 --> 11:31.157
or he fucks off
or whatever he does.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.926
But his always
been straight with me.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.964
And then I go off stage,
ready to celebrate.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.066
Ready to get, you know,
a couple of drinks

11:40.100 --> 11:42.168
and they are staring at me.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.937
I don't want to know
where we're going

11:43.970 --> 11:45.305
or where we're staying
I just want to know

11:45.338 --> 11:47.140
if we're fucking
gonna stay together.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.145
I smashed her guitar,
so It's over. It's the end.

11:53.279 --> 11:58.985
Yeah, yeah, that's probably...
that's probably definitely true.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.987
This is my fucking
life, you know.

-Can you imagine what
it's like when it's a storm?

12:18.605 --> 12:20.273
Why do you live in a caravan?

12:20.306 --> 12:21.408
I don't think I ever
been in love.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.043
I wasn't in love with Toby.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.144
I don't know
if I ever felt love.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.879
You were with Toby for like

12:25.912 --> 12:27.280
-several years.
-A million years, I know.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.049
What I'm thinking is that
what you need to do is...

12:29.082 --> 12:30.850
You need to sort of think
about what's coming.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.285
Because technically speaking

12:32.318 --> 12:33.853

traditionally...

12:33.887 --> 12:35.321
Can't we just be
here right now?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.924
It will be suppression.
It will be depression.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.160
So I think avoid it,
avoid it, avoid it.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.261
Be clever.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.297
I think you should just
do something else.

go to Penderyn University?

-Prawns and krill.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.024
I like them fried.

13:11.057 --> 13:14.427
-Prawns fried...
-I like them also sautéed.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.996
"I like them
also sautéed."

13:17.030 --> 13:18.932
-With garlic and butter.
-"With garlic and butter."

13:18.965 --> 13:21.201
-Why not learn more about them?
-This is perfect.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.069
OK, why not...
before I eat them.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.137

-Well you know your last night

16:15.675 --> 16:17.644
you decided that you wanted
to go to university.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.646
Don't you remember? You always
wanted to be a marine biologist.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.148
That's what we did
last night. We applied.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.818

are coming in.

Is there a rave or something?
Is there a rave tonight?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.936
They don't do it anymore.
People don't take drugs anymore.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.871
They all just,
kind of, get together

23:24.904 --> 23:27.640
and grow beards and,
you know, write in notebooks.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.709
Do you know what I mean?
They want to save the world.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.544

It's been a long time for me.
That's my rave face.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.966
I would just touch myself
for about an hour and a half.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.037
Maybe that's why I'm meant to
be here. Because I'm meant
to educate them.

23:57.070 --> 23:58.972
-Yeah!
-We are women of experience.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.741

25:07.807 --> 25:09.909
-Don't feel any pressure.
-You should come. It'll be fun.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.812
There is going to be
a whole bunch of us
flat mates and what not.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.814
Do you have any friends
that you can bring as well?

25:14.848 --> 25:16.850
-Sexually active male friends.
-Sexually active male friends.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.785
Yeah, I've got some of those,
yeah.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.920
Any who might want to have
sexually intercourse with me?

25:20.954 --> 25:23.656
-Yeah, do you have any
of those kind of friends?
-Yeah.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.658
-OK, great.
-Yeah, that's good.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.594
-You could bring some of those.
-Yeah, you could just bring--

25:27.627 --> 25:29.863
You could come. And then you can
bring some of your friends.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.097
Like a lot of your male friends

25:31.131 --> 25:32.866
so we could just kind of
go through

25:32.899 --> 25:36.803
and go: Yeah, no,
yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

25:36.836 --> 25:40.707
No! So we could just have
a lot of options, really.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.642
Do you like beards?

25:42.676 --> 25:43.376
[Sara] I don't mind beards.

25:43.410 --> 25:45.045
I enjoy a beard.

25:45.078 --> 25:47.147

-Beards kind of works for me.

25:47.180 --> 25:48.581

25:50.116 --> 25:53.053
I've got lady friends as well.

25:53.086 --> 25:55.188
[Jo] No, we don't need you
to bring them, though.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.823
I can't bring them.
Don't bring...

25:56.856 --> 25:58.792
I have done barbeques before.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.961
When I did it, we just had
wood and kind of lit it.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.664
And kind of... sometime
you get a potato

26:04.698 --> 26:08.034
and you put it in the foil.
Put it in so it's
cooking all the time.

26:08.068 --> 26:11.404
'Cause it cooks slower than
the sausages and stuff.

26:11.438 --> 26:13.907
And then people...
Maybe salads as well?

26:13.940 --> 26:16.943
-Yeah.
-[Jo] Just bring some sexually
active friends tonight.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.713

-Yeah, OK. Ciao then!

26:26.686 --> 26:29.055
-Do you want a pizza?
-Good to get to see you, Pete.
We keep running into each other.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.091
Do you want pizza?
We didn't ask if he wanted to...

26:31.124 --> 26:33.693
We're gonna get laid tonight!

26:33.727 --> 26:35.628

-And I'm gonna do it first.

26:36.296 --> 26:37.997

we technically speaking,

26:40.734 --> 26:43.770

-First penis in your body
gets 50 quid.

-[Jo] It's not bad!

27:21.341 --> 27:22.942
[Pete] I'm not doing that.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.110
[Pete] I might
mess my trainers up.

[Jo] No, come in with me.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.781

to figure out, really.

So, I can know what
you're talking about, so.

44:06.146 --> 44:10.984
I get it. I get that.
To me it's kind of... Ahem.

44:11.017 --> 44:14.487
It probably must have been even
harder for you. Younger age.

44:14.521 --> 44:16.823
Yeah, I mean it was
a long time ago though, so.

44:18.758 --> 44:20.760
Yeah, but still.
It's hard, you know.

like a competition.

45:52.218 --> 45:53.953

-Do you think he's
in love with you?

46:19.879 --> 46:21.614
-Is that what you're saying?
-I don't know if he's
in love with me,

46:21.648 --> 46:24.050

53:45.725 --> 53:47.694
He's the guy who takes care--
And I'm the bet guy.

53:47.727 --> 53:49.596
-He's. you know, he's--
-Bet guy.

53:49.629 --> 53:52.365
No, he's the guy
who just came in

53:52.399 --> 53:53.733
-when we were on the road.
-Just came in?

53:53.767 --> 53:55.535
-And he just took care of stuff.
-He just came in

53:55.568 --> 53:56.569
and took care
of you on the road.

53:56.603 --> 53:57.904
Yeah, he just showed up.

53:57.937 --> 54:01.508
I don't know how he found
us here.

54:01.541 --> 54:02.442
Me.

54:03.777 --> 54:05.078
It doesn't really
matter anymore.

54:05.111 --> 54:06.680
He doesn't change things.

54:06.713 --> 54:07.681
Some change
and he doesn't change, and...

54:09.716 --> 54:11.584
Was he doing it
last night, though?

54:11.618 --> 54:12.552
'Cause it looked like

54:13.553 --> 54:15.789
he was going to be taking
care of some stuff.

54:15.822 --> 54:17.757
I took care of him.
He didn't take care of me.

54:17.791 --> 54:20.427
So you took care of-- OK.

54:29.569 --> 54:31.438
I don't know why we're in
such a rush, you know.

54:32.639 --> 54:34.708
We're racing.

54:36.810 --> 54:39.446
Do you know that story
<i>The Tortoise and the Hare?</i>

54:39.479 --> 54:41.581
-Yeah.
-The hare and the tortoise.

54:41.614 --> 54:42.882
-It was like the--
-The tortoise and the hare.

54:42.916 --> 54:45.585
The hare kind of runs on
and has a kip.

54:45.618 --> 54:47.620
'Cause no, because the
tortoise takes a moment.

54:47.654 --> 54:49.823
You know it stops.
It takes it's time.

54:49.856 --> 54:52.359
And it enjoys the journey.

54:52.392 --> 54:54.861
The hare is just-- She's
off, and she doesn't...

54:56.663 --> 54:57.864
She doesn't take
a moment to just...

54:59.866 --> 55:01.634
look around!

55:01.668 --> 55:02.836
To sit in the rain.

55:02.869 --> 55:04.704
To sit in the rain.

55:04.738 --> 55:06.339
Under a proper tree.

55:07.474 --> 55:08.408
Yeah.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.383
That's a story my mum
would always read to me.

55:16.416 --> 55:17.817
-And...
-Yeah.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.655
I don't know. I've always
felt that I've just been...

55:24.824 --> 55:29.496
Racing, racing, racing, racing
to get to what? I don't know.

55:29.529 --> 55:30.997
I don't know.

55:31.031 --> 55:33.667
If you need, um
to take a minute...

55:34.701 --> 55:36.636
Yeah, just...

55:37.771 --> 55:38.772
[sighs]

55:43.743 --> 55:45.745
-It's nice.
-If you want someone to

55:45.779 --> 55:48.815
sit with you under a tree,
yeah, I can be the guy.

55:48.848 --> 55:50.884
Be that guy. I'll be the...

55:51.885 --> 55:53.687
The rain-tree-guy.

55:54.654 --> 55:56.523
I'll be the girl who...

55:56.556 --> 55:58.925
Who gets up on tables and
dances and falls and...

55:58.958 --> 56:01.695
The face-of-
that-guy-girl.

56:01.728 --> 56:02.696
I'll be the...

-Really?

56:11.971 --> 56:13.406
Girl.

56:14.474 --> 56:16.509
I've seen your moves.
And I've seen you dancing.

56:16.543 --> 56:19.212
And I think-- I think there
is a beast in there.

56:19.245 --> 56:20.780
I think there is
a beast in there.

56:20.814 --> 56:23.550
-He's just hiding.
-I will be the guy who

56:23.583 --> 56:25.585
hiding the beast-- I'm...

56:25.618 --> 56:27.887
-You're the hi--
the hidden-beast-guy.
-A hidden-beast-guy.

56:27.921 --> 56:29.723
-If you're the beast,
then I can be beauty.
-I could be like...

56:31.257 --> 56:32.759
Yeah, you could.

56:32.792 --> 56:33.827

You're nice.

Not, no, no.

No, watch this.
That's kind of not nice.

58:01.614 --> 58:02.816
That was not nice, was it?

58:02.849 --> 58:04.150
Wasn't a nice thing to do.

OK, no!

58:07.654 --> 58:08.822
-No!
-Alright, sorry.

58:10.090 --> 58:11.691
Just thought we would do...

[sighs]

58:15.028 --> 58:15.862
Augh!

58:19.666 --> 58:21.067
I can't lift my leg
that high, but...

58:25.805 --> 58:26.940
We can go for that swim now.

58:28.008 --> 58:29.976
Yeah, you got to wait.

58:30.010 --> 58:31.911
You got to wait half
an hour after eating

58:31.945 --> 58:33.747
before you can have a swim.
I wouldn't do it.

58:33.780 --> 58:34.948
-I have heard that.
-I would do it normally

58:34.981 --> 58:36.616

That's a good idea.

The old women are
the crazy ones, right?

58:41.688 --> 58:42.956
They come down here

58:42.989 --> 58:44.090
and they swim back
and forth like that.

58:45.191 --> 58:47.660
They virtually
kind of crack the ice.

58:47.694 --> 58:49.162
Jump in,

58:49.195 --> 58:50.730
in wetsuits.

58:50.764 --> 58:51.931
Do you surf?

58:51.965 --> 58:53.667
No, I don't.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.869
-I'd like to try it I think.
-Oh you should. It's so fun.

58:55.902 --> 58:57.203
-You do?
-Uh-huh.

58:57.237 --> 58:59.072
-Yeah.
-Yeah, my family

58:59.105 --> 59:00.640
used to vacation in Hawaii.

59:00.674 --> 59:02.075
Of course they did. Yeah.

59:02.108 --> 59:03.777
-The American dream!
-Of course they did.

59:03.810 --> 59:05.078
Living the American dream.

59:07.681 --> 59:09.049
Brilliant!

59:09.082 --> 59:10.684
Have you ever been
to the States?

59:10.717 --> 59:12.752
No. I'd like to go.

59:13.687 --> 59:15.188
I'd like to see more of
the world all together

59:15.221 --> 59:17.691
but I really would like to
try the States, I think.

59:17.724 --> 59:19.826
So Hawaii with your family?

59:21.861 --> 59:23.196
-My dad.
-Yeah?

59:23.229 --> 59:25.932
Yeah, my dad lives
outside of Seattle.

59:25.965 --> 59:26.900
OK.

59:28.034 --> 59:29.736
He's still around,
kicking around.

59:31.771 --> 59:33.139
Must be hard to be
here with him there.

59:34.140 --> 59:35.141
We're not close.

59:40.447 --> 59:42.148
You should do something
about that, I think.

59:43.283 --> 59:44.751
It's not--
'Cause, you know...

59:46.753 --> 59:47.887
You shouldn't regret it.

59:49.723 --> 59:51.024
Don't regret
stuff like that.

59:57.263 --> 59:58.998
He has been calling
me a lot lately.

59:59.032 --> 01:00:00.900
I don't know what--
Seems like he's trying

01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:02.068
to track me down.

01:00:04.237 --> 01:00:06.039
But he's a great guy.
He's a nice guy.

01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:07.674
He's...

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:08.908
You should call him.

01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:13.813
Uhm.

01:00:13.847 --> 01:00:14.881
No, really you should.

01:00:18.918 --> 01:00:20.453
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

01:00:20.487 --> 01:00:22.022
-I should.
-Call him.

01:00:22.055 --> 01:00:24.224
I wish I could call
my dad, and I can't.

01:00:24.257 --> 01:00:25.658
So...

01:00:26.926 --> 01:00:28.261
Maybe you should--
Just don't let it...

01:00:30.196 --> 01:00:31.197
It's not good.

01:00:32.932 --> 01:00:34.267
It's not good to
leave things.

01:00:38.204 --> 01:00:40.140
Clear kind of-- It's
a good time for you

01:00:40.173 --> 01:00:41.775
to just clear everything up.

01:00:42.776 --> 01:00:43.710
Yeah.

01:00:44.844 --> 01:00:46.212
[sighs]

01:00:46.246 --> 01:00:47.981
Yeah, you're right, I think.

01:00:50.216 --> 01:00:54.220
I have somethings
I need to figure out.

01:00:54.254 --> 01:00:56.156
One of them being Larry.

01:00:56.189 --> 01:00:57.924
Not him. Don't phone him.

01:00:57.957 --> 01:00:59.793
Well, I'm not gonna--

01:01:00.794 --> 01:01:03.029
Just, you know,
about the band and...

01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:06.266
Just some things
I need to put to bed.

01:01:06.299 --> 01:01:07.901
Yeah. OK.

01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:10.937
Do you want me to take that?

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.872
-Oh!
-You want that gone.

01:01:14.074 --> 01:01:15.975
Thank you, sir.

01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:17.811
Thank you. Nice.

01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:20.947
What a kind sir. What a
kind British man you are.

01:01:24.984 --> 01:01:26.920
Hit it. No, we're
just playing

pass in a small corridor.

01:01:28.188 --> 01:01:30.357
That's what I call
a light breaker.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.058
Watch yourself now.

01:01:32.092 --> 01:01:33.126
Alright!

01:01:33.159 --> 01:01:35.195
-I can't help it.
-See it.

01:01:37.263 --> 01:01:39.199
You're not really meant to play
ball games in the corridor.

01:01:39.232 --> 01:01:42.335
-Sorry It's been...
-Oh, they're fine.

01:01:42.369 --> 01:01:44.804
Hey, we need your help.

01:01:44.838 --> 01:01:46.106
We're try-- You're
not gonna like this.

01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:47.240
We're trying to
organize this party.

01:01:47.273 --> 01:01:49.009
We don't have a DJ.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.543
We don't have a theme.

01:01:50.577 --> 01:01:52.112
Don't listen to her.
We've got loads of CD's.

01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:53.847
That takes the theme.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.814
-It's not a theme.
-We have got music.

01:01:54.848 --> 01:01:55.815
We've got food.

01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:57.951
What about a 90's party?

01:01:57.984 --> 01:01:59.152
A 90's theme party.

01:01:59.185 --> 01:02:00.954
-Great.
-I was born in the 90's.

01:02:00.987 --> 01:02:02.255
We were born then. We
don't really remember it.

01:02:02.288 --> 01:02:03.256
-Let's bring it back.
-That's more fun.

01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:05.125
Oasis, smiley faces,

01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:06.926
-Garage bands.
-It's fun.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.129
Lots of drugs. Raves were
happening back then.

01:02:09.162 --> 01:02:11.364
And they were awesome.
And you have me!

01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:13.266
-Uh, yeah.
-So!

01:02:13.299 --> 01:02:16.002
She's been around.
She knows how to do this.

01:02:16.036 --> 01:02:17.037
She's been around.

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:18.238
That is a good thing.

01:02:18.271 --> 01:02:19.873
-She's on board.
-I'm on board.

01:02:19.906 --> 01:02:21.007
We have two on board.
-I know...

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.142
We just need a third on board

01:02:22.175 --> 01:02:24.244
and we can kick this up a notch.

01:02:24.277 --> 01:02:26.012
It's the greatest
decade of all time.

01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:28.248
I mean you know.
You were wearing the vintage

01:02:28.281 --> 01:02:29.816
Union Jack.

01:02:29.849 --> 01:02:31.885
-It's ironic.
-Geri Halliwell.

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:33.286
Geri, Spice Girls.
There you go.

01:02:33.319 --> 01:02:36.089

01:02:43.163 --> 01:02:45.165
There you go. This is the
Spice Girls right here.

01:02:45.198 --> 01:02:47.167
We could literary be the
Spice Girls if we wanted to.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.071
This is going to be the
greatest night of your life.

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:52.205
-He'll be there.
-Yeah!

01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:53.273
-I'll be there.
-Yeah!
