WEBVTT

00:24.154 --> 00:25.503
Boss!

00:25.590 --> 00:28.506
Will, get in here, quick.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.552
Damn, Charlie.
What's going on?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.467
We running out of coffee?
- Look.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.648
Son of a bitch.
They're stealing my cattle.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.219
Hey!

00:46.481 --> 00:47.656
The hell you think
you're doing?

00:47.743 --> 00:49.266
Take it easy, Mr. Dewey.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.615
It's been five years.

00:50.702 --> 00:51.834
You knew this day was coming
sooner or later.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.618
I want you off my land, now.

00:53.705 --> 00:56.186
I'm afraid we can't do that.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.970
I'm not asking,
I'm telling you.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.233
Show him, Ron.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.640
Damn, Will.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.294
He was going for the warrant.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.256
I thought it was his gun.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.370
Morning.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.154
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.548
How you doing?
- Good.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.333
Just catching up
on some emails.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.030
Giddy up.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.641
Two agents from the
Bureau of Land Management

01:59.728 --> 02:01.469
disappeared yesterday
in Wyoming.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.123
Wouldn't our West Coast team
catch that?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.907
They're in hot pursuit
of a fugitive in Mexico,

02:04.994 --> 02:06.604
high profile cartel case.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.215
Isobel wants us to jump in.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.173
Jet's getting fueled,
we're wheels up in thirty.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.653
I'll call
the Cheyenne field office,

02:11.740 --> 02:13.524
make sure we have
some Tahoes and an MCC.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.396
There's been tension
between Land Management

02:15.483 --> 02:16.788
and some of the locals.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.094
They're not gonna be happy
to see a crew

02:18.181 --> 02:19.095
of New York Feds
up in their grill.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.666
You joining this
goat rodeo or what?

02:24.753 --> 02:26.755
Yes, sorry.

02:31.368 --> 02:35.329
There are 18 million acres of
federal land here in Wyoming.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.027
The Bureau of Land Management
is responsible for all of them.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.071
The agents that disappeared--

02:39.159 --> 02:41.117
Mike Palmer and Ron Dodson.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.553
What were they working on?

02:42.640 --> 02:43.989
They were executing
a seizure warrant

02:44.076 --> 02:45.643
on a cattle rancher
in Lincoln County.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.907
They were taking his animals?
His livelihood?

02:48.994 --> 02:51.867
These ranchers lease
federal land to graze a herd.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.174
Some of them think that they're
entitled to graze for free.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.958
When they refuse to pay
on their leases,

02:56.045 --> 02:57.829
the law says that we can take
their livestock as collateral.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.875
You don't pay your mortgage,
the bank takes your house?

02:59.962 --> 03:01.442
Exactly.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.095
Who's the rancher
they were serving yesterday?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.923
A man named Will Dewey.

03:05.010 --> 03:08.449
Now, his family has owned
a spread of 60 acres

03:08.536 --> 03:10.146
in Lincoln County
since before I was born.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.105
He stopped paying his
grazing fees five years ago.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.717
It was 160 grand
plus penalties and interest.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.327
That's a big number.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.633
Well, we tried to work
something out with him,

03:18.720 --> 03:20.112
but he wouldn't come
to the table.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.550
So I filed the seizure warrant.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.160
And Palmer and Dodson
were on their way

03:24.247 --> 03:26.031
with the livestock trailer
yesterday morning.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.469
That was the last
we heard of 'em.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.689
Mr. Dewey had some errands
to run in town.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.387
Well, we'll wait here
till he gets back.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.866
Suit yourself.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.652
I expect he'll be gone
most of the day.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.871
Can I ask if you were here
yesterday morning?

03:39.958 --> 03:43.005
Yes, ma'am.
I work every day but Sundays.

03:43.092 --> 03:46.922
Mr. Dewey gives me
the day off for church.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.880
Did a couple of agents from
the Bureau of Land Management

03:48.967 --> 03:51.709
happen to pay a visit?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.842
No, ma'am.
I get here early.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.409
I would have seen them
if they did.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.845
Maybe you noticed
the livestock trailers

03:56.932 --> 03:57.672
they were towing in the area?

03:57.759 --> 03:59.848
Nope.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.676
Something happen to them?

04:01.763 --> 04:03.678
Possibly.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.506
Ah, I can't say
I'm surprised.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.682
A lot of folks out here
don't take kindly

04:07.769 --> 04:09.031
to Land Management.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.860
What about your boss?

04:11.947 --> 04:14.210
Mr. Dewey's got no beef
with them, far as I know.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.777
Is he up on his grazing fees?

04:17.953 --> 04:21.696
Don't do the man's books,
just look after his animals.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.873
I gotta get to town
to pick up some feed.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.789
Anything else?

04:27.876 --> 04:28.964
Not at the moment.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.487
Thank you for your time.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.492
It looks like
Will Dewey conveniently

04:35.579 --> 04:37.059
made himself scarce today.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.147
I'm thinking
good old Charlie's

04:38.234 --> 04:39.453
playing country dumb.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.629
It could be.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.284
If it was an act,
it was a pretty good one.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.811
Whoa.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.421
Hold on a second.

04:54.598 --> 04:57.253
We've got a new chain
on a rusty gate.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.169
Yep.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.739
Those look like
dual-wheel tire tracks.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.436
Could be
from a livestock trailer.

05:06.523 --> 05:07.785
Yeah.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.836
Pants on fire, Charlie.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.534
But other than his issues
with Land Management,

05:17.621 --> 05:19.362
Will Dewey is an
upstanding citizen.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.972
He was born and raised
on the ranch.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.278
He graduated
from local high school.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.193
He has no criminal record.
- Family?

05:24.280 --> 05:25.803
His father died
eight years ago

05:25.890 --> 05:27.327
and left the ranch to him
and his older brother, Cole.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.893
And where does Cole live?

05:28.980 --> 05:31.592
In a town called Kemmerer.
It's the county seat.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.028
But he still owns
a piece of the ranch?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.812
It looks that way.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.684
Do we have cell phone
locations on these hombres?

05:36.771 --> 05:39.556
No--either the phones are off
or they're in the dead zone.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.558
We don't get great service
out here in the boonies.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.952
Okay, time to track down
the Dewey brothers.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.440
Where are they?

05:53.527 --> 05:54.919
In here.

06:00.403 --> 06:04.146
Damn, boys.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.408
You two really
humped the heifer this time.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.715
Your brother shot him,
not me.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.630
I thought they were
stealing our cattle.

06:09.717 --> 06:12.110
With Land Management patches
on their jacket?

06:15.810 --> 06:18.116
Did you clean up
where this happened?

06:18.203 --> 06:19.814
The best we could.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.773
FBI came to the ranch.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.340
Charlie thinks we need
to call the sheriff.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.168
No.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.866
Ain't nobody going to the law.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.825
Well, then what do--
what do we do with the truck

06:30.912 --> 06:32.392
and the two bodies?

06:34.872 --> 06:36.787
Listen, Charlie...

06:39.703 --> 06:42.706
I need you to trust me
on this, okay?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.672
Cole.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.466
What did you do that for?

07:03.553 --> 07:05.337
Are you that dumb?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.122
Old Charlie here
was about to rat you out.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.256
Oh, God.

07:12.954 --> 07:13.911
Now you're leaving?

07:15.739 --> 07:16.436
This is your mess, Will.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.135
You clean it up.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.662
I got worried when Charlie

07:25.749 --> 07:27.708
didn't come home
from work yesterday.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.014
I stayed up all night
waiting for him

07:30.101 --> 07:32.060
and then reached out
to Sheriff Franklin

07:32.147 --> 07:33.888
first thing this morning.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.542
Have you tried
calling your husband?

07:35.629 --> 07:37.457
A hundred times.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.197
It goes right to voicemail.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.025
Has Charlie ever
not come home before?

07:41.112 --> 07:42.549
Never.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.812
He's not one
to miss his supper.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.729
I reached out to you
because I don't have

07:48.816 --> 07:50.295
a good feeling about this.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.558
I'm guessing it has
something to do

07:51.645 --> 07:52.863
with those missing
federal agents.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.300
Because Charlie
was working for Will Dewey.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.259
Yeah, it's no big secret
the Dewey ranch was underwater

07:57.346 --> 08:00.218
with the Land Management.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.786
What do you know
about Will's brother, Cole?

08:02.873 --> 08:04.092
A bit.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.136
Why, do you think
he's involved?

08:05.223 --> 08:06.834
I wouldn't be surprised.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.836
Cole runs something they call
the Ranchers' Cooperative.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.664
Started out
as a handful of cattlemen

08:10.751 --> 08:11.752
with a common set of problems.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.841
Like paying the Bureau
of Land Management

08:13.928 --> 08:16.757
for grazing rights?
- Well, there's that.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.629
But under Cole's leadership,
it shapeshifted

08:19.716 --> 08:22.153
into something else,
something closer

08:22.240 --> 08:24.286
to an anti-government militia.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.897
Cole suddenly got invested
in getting my job.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.160
Ran against me last November
for county sheriff

08:29.247 --> 08:31.946
and nearly beat me, too,
when a few ranchers showed up

08:32.033 --> 08:35.950
to be armed poll watchers
and intimidate my supporters.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.299
You think Cole
could be harboring

08:37.386 --> 08:38.779
his brother someplace?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.998
Well, they don't
really see eye to eye,

08:41.085 --> 08:43.827
but blood is thicker than
the Bureau of Land Management,

08:43.914 --> 08:46.917
so yeah, it's possible.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.180
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- And just one thing.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.313
Watch your step
with these ranchers.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.839
They have grievances and guns,
and that's a cocktail party

08:55.926 --> 08:57.624
you don't want any part of.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.147
Why don't you drive out
to Cole's place with us?

08:59.234 --> 09:02.193
I'm one step ahead of you.
You checked on Cole Dewey?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.369
Uh, he's not home, and he's
not answering his phone.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.111
I got Moss and Echavaria
sitting on his place.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.245
If Cole's in the wind,
he's in this neck deep.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.218
- Damn you, Will.
- What's wrong?

09:27.305 --> 09:28.742
Now I got the sheriff's
department watching my house,

09:28.829 --> 09:30.439
all 'cause of you.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.006
- They follow you here?
- Do you think that I'm stupid?

09:32.093 --> 09:33.485
You're the jagoff
that screwed up.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.239
You know what?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.328
I'm done with you.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.070
You just leave me out of this.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.029
I'll make sure I visit you
when you're on death row.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.428
Cole?

10:03.515 --> 10:04.516
What?

10:10.348 --> 10:12.176
What am I supposed to do?

10:19.357 --> 10:21.403
The FBI is not gonna stop.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.190
Not till they nail us both
to a cross.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.368
So we're gonna
seize the moment.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.935
Seize it?

10:32.022 --> 10:34.024
How?

10:34.111 --> 10:36.374
First thing we're gonna do,

10:36.461 --> 10:37.985
you're gonna get rid
of this truck.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.160
After that...

10:42.467 --> 10:44.078
You and me, we're gonna
go down to Cold Springs.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.038
We're gonna take matters
into our own hands.

11:02.879 --> 11:03.706
The sheriff was just down
at the Dewey ranch.

11:03.793 --> 11:04.838
Nobody there but cattle.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.578
Put BOLOs out
on Will and Cole.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.537
Look, I've been reading up
on this Ranchers' Cooperative

11:08.624 --> 11:10.670
that Cole Dewey runs,
and it's nothing

11:10.757 --> 11:12.410
but a bunch of angry men.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.716
Well, the sheriff
did say they have guns.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.326
Everybody has guns out here.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.502
And they also
have a manifesto.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.287
"The U.S. government
has no rights

11:19.374 --> 11:21.115
"to land outside
of Washington D.C.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.986
"and that the
Bureau of Land Management

11:23.073 --> 11:24.640
"is nothing but a cartel
that survives

11:24.727 --> 11:26.642
on robbery and intimidation."

11:26.729 --> 11:28.209
And this man
was almost sheriff here.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.646
Tax evasion was just
a feather in his cap.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.170
He quotes and misquotes
the Constitution all the time.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.564
I mean,
state counties are sovereign,

11:35.651 --> 11:37.218
sheriffs are the highest law
of the land.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.524
We get the picture.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.483
Sheriff Franklin
just got a call,

11:41.570 --> 11:43.615
a hunter spotted
a wrecked pickup and trailer

11:43.703 --> 11:44.747
at the bottom of a ravine.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.488
- Right.
- Yep.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.157
That's a Land Management rig.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.333
Nobody in the driver cab?

12:05.420 --> 12:07.509
I doubt the driver walked out
of this wreck alive.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.945
Somebody must have
pushed it off the road

12:09.032 --> 12:10.686
before they jumped out.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.470
Let's get this thing open.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.914
Oh, God.

12:26.528 --> 12:30.532
Agent Palmer and Dodson,
both shot dead.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.751
That's Charlie Williams
with them.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.798
It looks like
he was strangled.

12:35.885 --> 12:38.061
Felicia's gonna be a mess.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.324
And he's got
broken fingernails.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.849
He definitely put up a fight.

12:42.936 --> 12:46.069
Why kill a man who's worked
for your family for 40 years?

12:46.156 --> 12:50.421
Cole and Will Dewey
are shedding their liabilities.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.380
This is only gonna get worse
before it gets better.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.039
Nice to meet
you, Mr. Garrett.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.259
Do I know you?

13:02.346 --> 13:04.740
- We're the Dewey brothers.
- What?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.046
Wait.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.874
We have a little errand
to run together.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.354
You just keep your wits
about you and get in the truck.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.355
What--what are you doing?
Wai--

13:16.708 --> 13:18.232
The tire tracks match
the truck and trailer

13:18.319 --> 13:19.799
at the Dewey ranch.

13:19.886 --> 13:20.887
Palmer and Dodson
were definitely there.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.324
Okay, so where are we?

13:23.411 --> 13:24.586
The brothers ambushed them
when they tried

13:24.673 --> 13:26.544
to seize the cattle,
Charlie witnesses it,

13:26.631 --> 13:28.068
so they kill him too.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.199
Anything from Barnes and Ray?

13:29.286 --> 13:31.071
They executed
both the warrants

13:31.158 --> 13:32.507
at the Dewey Ranch,
but no leads

13:32.594 --> 13:34.291
on where they are
or who they're with.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.293
They could be anywhere.
This is their backyard.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.078
They've got rancher friends
all over the county.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.297
Let's drill down
on this Ranchers' Cooperative.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.604
I want a list of every member.
- I'm on it.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.519
We should also run down
those poll watchers...

13:44.606 --> 13:45.781
And any contributors

13:45.868 --> 13:47.087
to Cole Dewey's
political campaign.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.785
Good idea. Remy Scott.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.787
Where?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.223
Copy that. We're on our way.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.399
Sheriff Franklin
has eyes on Cole's pickup

13:55.486 --> 13:59.534
heading north on 241,
three miles out of Afton.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.623
Okay. I'm in their comms.
I've got eyes on her.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.320
You two stay here
and run ops.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.845
Have Ray and Barnes
join me in the pursuit.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.607
What's the login
for those comms?

14:29.694 --> 14:31.696
Hana?

14:31.783 --> 14:32.959
Sending it now.

14:33.046 --> 14:33.916
Sorry.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.275
Still northbound on 241.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.494
You got about eight miles.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.583
What's our ETA
to intercept them?

14:48.670 --> 14:51.151
<i>- 20 minutes, give or take.</i>
- Ray, pick up the pace.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.761
We got a lot of ground
to cover.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.110
You know this is
a big-ass state, right?

14:58.636 --> 15:01.204
All units,
suspects are pulling over.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.467
Remy,
sheriff says they're stopping.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.600
Tell her not to engage,
backup's on the way.

15:05.687 --> 15:06.949
Sheriff, this is Agent Gaines
with the FBI.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.081
Do not engage.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.126
<i>We've got people on the way.</i>

15:10.213 --> 15:12.085
I don't think
I have a choice at this point.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.266
Stop right there.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.224
Let's keep this friendly, Molly.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.661
Friendly, sure.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.055
I'm gonna need to see both
you boys on the ground first.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.579
There's no reason to be
pointing that gun at us.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.146
We're not armed.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.800
You wanna take me in,
I'll go.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.976
I'm an innocent man.

15:34.063 --> 15:34.977
That'll be up to the jury.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.718
Now get on the ground.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.415
Do what she says, Will.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.856
Now you too, Cole.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.206
Look, my brother surrendered.

15:46.293 --> 15:47.859
Take him and be on your way.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.775
I'm not gonna ask you again.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.690
You know,
I don't believe that

15:52.777 --> 15:54.779
you're gonna gun down your
unarmed political adversary

15:54.866 --> 15:57.608
over a traffic stop.

15:57.695 --> 15:58.827
That's very bad optics, Molly.

16:01.308 --> 16:04.050
- Who's in there?
- That's my dog, Milo.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.576
Easy, Molly. Easy.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.579
Stop moving!

16:11.666 --> 16:13.059
Get her up, Will.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.801
I don't know
about this, Cole.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.455
Shut up
and get her in the truck.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.763
What's going on here, Cole?

16:21.850 --> 16:23.243
You'll see.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.853
The FBI is right behind me.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.507
Screw them.
Let her go!

16:29.031 --> 16:30.598
How much further, Hana?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.382
Three miles.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.949
Have you heard
from the sheriff?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.820
Nope.
I can't get her on the radio.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.126
That's not good.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.700
- Hey, that's Cole's pick-up!
- Turn around.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.450
You guys have us?

16:56.537 --> 16:57.451
Yeah.
What happened to the sheriff?

16:57.538 --> 16:59.409
I didn't see her.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.411
No visual
on Cole's truck yet.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.500
Seconds behind.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.806
All right, there's a fork
in the road

17:04.893 --> 17:06.025
about a half mile ahead.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.156
He could go either way.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.636
Ray, take left.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.463
Copy.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.338
Remy, don't take
the first turn.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.862
You can intercept them
if you go down Blue Hole Road.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.168
It's your second right.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.865
Blue Hole Road.

17:20.952 --> 17:21.997
Got it.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.751
<i>Hana!
What the hell just happened?</i>

17:36.838 --> 17:38.492
<i>I'm all out of road up here.</i>

17:38.579 --> 17:40.102
Ray, tell me you have them.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.538
We got nothing on our end.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.149
I don't understand.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.064
<i>- He must have went your way.</i>
- No, they didn't!

17:45.151 --> 17:47.936
- What is this?
<i>- Hana, talk to me.</i>

17:48.023 --> 17:51.287
Blue Hole Road is closed
due to snow melt.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.941
I missed the alert. I'm
sorry.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.856
Don't be sorry,
just do your damn job.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.562
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.347
Hana, yesterday I walked
into the muster room,

18:07.434 --> 18:08.522
you were up to something
on your computer.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.089
Today your head's been--
I don't know where.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.700
Please, what is going on?

18:15.006 --> 18:17.270
Earlier today I, um--

18:17.357 --> 18:18.923
I received this--

18:26.931 --> 18:28.411
Who is that?

18:28.498 --> 18:30.457
Um, it's--it's this guy
I met online.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.198
Look, it's a long story--
- Hana, get rid of that.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.938
It's on a protected browser.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.462
Yeah, fine, listen.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.420
Oh, God.

18:37.507 --> 18:40.206
Can you focus right now?

18:40.293 --> 18:43.644
Okay.
<i>- Kristin, are you there?</i>

18:43.731 --> 18:45.298
Go for Kristin.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.299
We've been trying
to get you on comms.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.217
Yeah, they went down
for a second, but we're back.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.306
<i>What's up?</i>

18:53.393 --> 18:54.959
So we found
the sheriff's car.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.787
She's gone,
but her service weapon

18:56.874 --> 18:58.702
and cell phone
are on the ground.

18:58.789 --> 18:59.834
The Deweys must have taken her.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.314
Does Remy know?

19:01.401 --> 19:02.619
Yeah, he's on
with their dispatch,

19:02.706 --> 19:03.925
units are on their way.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.100
Copy that.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.538
This was fired recently.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.061
She might have
gotten a shot off.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.063
- Yeah.
- What's that?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.456
It's a mini Constitution.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.154
Found it over there
with the gun.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.939
Lincoln County
Ranchers' Cooperative.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.723
They must have dropped it
when they took the sheriff.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.247
Well, I wonder what
the Bill of Rights has to say

19:21.334 --> 19:23.031
about kidnapping
a police officer?

19:23.118 --> 19:25.076
Right?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.122
What are these guys up to?

19:30.038 --> 19:32.475
Let's settle down.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.694
Take a seat.

19:42.398 --> 19:45.923
Now is the time that we,
the people,

19:46.010 --> 19:48.187
take back our county.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.364
This is our land,
not some outsider

19:51.451 --> 19:54.018
from the Bureau
of Land Mismanagement.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.195
I move to charge Ken Garrett

19:56.282 --> 19:58.240
with cattle rustling
and armed robbery.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.981
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.461
He is also responsible
for the deaths

20:01.548 --> 20:02.636
of three men
in Tucker's Ravine.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.203
Oh, hold on.
I did not kill anybody.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.032
What name
is on the seizure warrant

20:08.119 --> 20:09.425
against your ranch, Will?

20:09.512 --> 20:10.731
Ken Garrett.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.820
You may not have
pulled the trigger,

20:12.907 --> 20:14.691
but it is your hand
that set this all in motion.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.215
I was just doing my job.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.348
Your job.

20:19.435 --> 20:22.743
What about our jobs, Garrett?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.224
Our families, our livelihood,

20:25.311 --> 20:26.877
which you
and your government agency

20:26.964 --> 20:29.053
couldn't give a damn about.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.273
Mm-hmm. Damn straight.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.753
Blake.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.407
How far back
was your family running cattle

20:34.494 --> 20:35.843
in that allotment?

20:35.930 --> 20:39.020
Since before Land Management
was chartered,

20:39.107 --> 20:41.327
till last year, that is.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.285
When Ken Garrett here
canceled your lease--

20:43.372 --> 20:45.331
For environmental control.

20:45.418 --> 20:49.422
They said it was
too dry to graze.

20:49.509 --> 20:52.729
I had to sell off
my whole herd.

20:52.816 --> 20:56.211
And that is what happens
when Uncle Sam owns half.

20:56.298 --> 21:00.650
They own half of our rangeland,

21:00.737 --> 21:02.304
and that is unacceptable.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.396
What about you, Sullivan?

21:09.137 --> 21:11.922
Land Management closed down
the access road I used

21:12.009 --> 21:14.751
to move my herd
between pastures.

21:14.838 --> 21:18.886
I had to haul my cattle
on the highway instead,

21:18.973 --> 21:23.020
till the day a semi crashed
into one of my trailers.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.721
Most of you know the rest.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.636
For those of you
who do not recall,

21:29.723 --> 21:32.378
it was Sully's oldest son, Caleb,

21:32.465 --> 21:34.467
that was behind the wheel
of that trailer.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.339
May he rest in peace.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.344
And why did the Feds
close that access road

21:42.431 --> 21:44.564
in the first place, Sully?

21:44.651 --> 21:47.958
To protect
an endangered species.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.917
A damn snail.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.833
A snail.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.269
You all should know
the Feds dissolved

21:54.356 --> 21:56.140
my allotment last year.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.492
I had to mortgage my spread
to lease some private grass.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.669
Now the bank's
trying to foreclose.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.410
Me and the kids
are gonna lose the ranch

22:04.497 --> 22:07.848
and wind up living in the
trailer park in Cokeville.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.594
Now's your chance.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.552
What do you have to say
in your defense?

22:18.641 --> 22:20.164
I was looking
at the same map.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.383
I didn't see the
road closure, either.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.559
This is Hana's skill set.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.692
It's why she's here.
- Mm-hmm.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.389
No one's more upset
about it than she is.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.522
This is not the first time.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.001
She also screwed up
with that traffic cam

22:31.088 --> 22:34.091
in Brooklyn a few weeks ago,
and the bank heist.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.963
What the hell is happening?

22:36.050 --> 22:38.531
Is she okay?

22:38.618 --> 22:40.446
Something's going on
with her in her personal life.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.143
I'll talk to her
about it later, okay?

22:42.230 --> 22:44.363
Right now she's good.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.626
She messed up.
She knows it.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.540
I think we move on.

22:50.194 --> 22:53.328
We got something.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.025
Just heard
from the Wyoming State Police.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.114
An hour before the BOLO
went out on the Deweys,

22:57.201 --> 22:58.855
they were seen
stuffing Ken Garrett

22:58.942 --> 23:00.640
into their truck outside
his office in Cold Springs.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.076
The Land Management director.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.817
Remy and I met
with him yesterday.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.167
There were two hostages in
that pickup when it got away?

23:06.254 --> 23:08.256
Right now, we need to
figure out why they'd take him

23:08.343 --> 23:09.823
and where they're going.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.477
I am making progress.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.043
I mean, we can talk
about it unless you

23:13.130 --> 23:14.436
wanna keep talking about me?

23:14.523 --> 23:17.047
Easy.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.398
So the mini Constitution
that Ray found down

23:19.485 --> 23:21.312
at the sheriff's car,
it's printed

23:21.400 --> 23:23.097
at a small shop
called Laramie Press,

23:23.184 --> 23:24.533
and you can only
order it by mail.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.579
I called to see if they'd
sent to any addresses

23:26.666 --> 23:27.928
in Lincoln County
and I got eight hits,

23:28.015 --> 23:29.495
including Cole Dewey.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.323
- Who are the others?
- Six men and one woman.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.934
Now, I haven't been able
to find too much

23:34.021 --> 23:35.805
on the mysterious
Ranchers' Co-op,

23:35.892 --> 23:38.329
but my hunch is,
is that they're all members.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.114
There are seven people
we need to go see?

23:40.201 --> 23:42.638
That's gonna take time.
- That's what I thought too.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.727
I cross-referenced
the addresses

23:44.814 --> 23:46.990
with cell phone numbers,
and six of the numbers

23:47.077 --> 23:49.123
converge to the same location

23:49.210 --> 23:50.951
at a Grange Hall
in Alpine, Wyoming.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.082
That can't be good.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.780
It's much worse
than you think.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.651
20 minutes ago, all six
powered down their cell phones.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.132
Two hostages
then a cattle call.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.612
These ranchers
are up to something.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.657
Notify the governor
and ask them

24:01.744 --> 24:03.006
to activate the National Guard.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.095
We don't want another
Ammon Bundy standoff,

24:05.182 --> 24:06.619
and this could be worse.

24:06.706 --> 24:07.794
We have hostages.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.450
Nice work, Hana.

24:16.759 --> 24:21.024
I don't make
Land Management policy.

24:21.111 --> 24:24.201
I just--I carry it out.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.901
All right, your issues
are with the suits in D.C.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.556
Just following orders, huh?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.949
Does that old chestnut
fly here in Lincoln County?

24:33.036 --> 24:34.908
all: No!
- I didn't think so.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.344
I will take your concerns
to the bureau,

24:36.431 --> 24:37.954
okay, all of yours!

24:38.041 --> 24:41.436
And I am sure that
we can work something out.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.090
Are you all happy with that?

24:43.177 --> 24:44.570
- Hell, no.
- No way!

24:46.659 --> 24:48.269
Then I say it's time we vote.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.230
All of those in favor
of returning a guilty verdict.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.667
all:
Aye.

24:56.843 --> 24:57.757
All opposed?

25:02.936 --> 25:04.241
Then let's do this.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.808
Do--do what?

25:05.895 --> 25:08.245
What are you--wait.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.073
Oh, hey, what are you--
what are you doing with that?

25:11.727 --> 25:13.424
Hey. Hey.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.687
No, no, hey, you don't
have to be doing this.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.910
No.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.696
All right.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.219
All right, all right,
all right, hold on.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.481
Hold on.
Cole, this is enough.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.527
Will, shut your mouth!

25:30.877 --> 25:32.139
Are you all
gonna bitch and moan

25:32.226 --> 25:34.576
like a bunch of snowflakes,

25:34.663 --> 25:36.186
or are you gonna
back up the talk?

25:36.273 --> 25:39.494
No, no, please!
Don't do this!

25:39.581 --> 25:42.889
I am an American,
just like you.

25:42.976 --> 25:46.153
And that's the trouble
with democracy, Garrett.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.590
Sometimes the vote doesn't
always go your way.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.303
Bring in the sheriff.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.740
She's next.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.751
Sheriff Franklin.

26:18.838 --> 26:22.581
She swore an oath to protect
and serve our community.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.060
But we are all very aware

26:24.147 --> 26:26.454
that she is beholden
to her campaign donors.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.803
You can't do this, Cole.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.152
To the
real estate developers.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.806
To the tourist outfitters,

26:30.893 --> 26:33.417
the transplants
from out of state

26:33.504 --> 26:35.594
that stuffed our ballot boxes
last November's election.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.031
Which you lost.

26:38.118 --> 26:40.207
Is that what this is about?

26:40.294 --> 26:43.166
This is a court
of common law,

26:43.253 --> 26:44.907
a last resort for those of us

26:44.994 --> 26:46.561
still willing to uphold
the Constitution.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.608
This is a kangaroo court,
and you damn well know it.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.784
I'll arrest everyone here
if you don't--

26:51.871 --> 26:55.657
You will
shut your mouth, Molly!

26:55.744 --> 26:58.312
Or I will shut it for you.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.884
What's the status
on the National Guard?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.494
They're an hour away.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.061
Any eyes inside?

27:08.148 --> 27:10.759
Yeah, I've got them.
10 or 12 men.

27:18.071 --> 27:21.465
I got ten vehicles out back,
mostly pickups.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.250
They got long guns
on the racks.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.904
Hana, can you tell
what's going on in there?

27:26.775 --> 27:28.821
It looks like Cole's
leading some sort of meeting.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.127
Any sign of Ken Garrett
or Sheriff Franklin?

27:31.214 --> 27:32.172
I don't know.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.826
I don't have the whole room.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.350
She stands by
while armed agents

27:36.437 --> 27:39.658
of the Federal government
trespass on your property

27:39.745 --> 27:41.007
and steal your livestock.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.530
Cole.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.883
Sheriff was never with them
when they came to my ranch.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.929
Will, sit down.

27:50.016 --> 27:53.236
As far as I know, Molly's an
honest woman and a good cop.

27:53.323 --> 27:54.281
Well then,
why didn't you vote--

27:54.368 --> 27:55.325
I did.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.851
What do you know
about being sheriff?

28:01.114 --> 28:03.290
Molly's bailed out
many of you in this room.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.205
When Big Johnny
got in that bar fight,

28:05.292 --> 28:07.598
who helped him
reduce his sentence?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.470
Molly!

28:09.557 --> 28:12.603
How about that DUI, Clayton?

28:12.691 --> 28:16.390
Sheriff Franklin and the
people that she represents,

28:16.477 --> 28:19.306
the so-called
champions of progress,

28:19.393 --> 28:21.395
they want our very way
of life to die out!

28:21.482 --> 28:23.702
Stop, Cole! Enough!

28:23.789 --> 28:25.573
I'm cutting her loose.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.357
- The hell you are.
- Get off me.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.577
I hold you in contempt.
Get him out of here.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.318
Get off me!

28:31.405 --> 28:32.667
Get your hands off me!
What are you doing?

28:32.754 --> 28:34.713
FBI! Drop your weapons!

28:34.800 --> 28:36.410
- Get back in!
- Back in here!

28:36.497 --> 28:37.890
- Move back!
- Hurry, to the windows!

28:47.856 --> 28:50.511
Help me out here!

28:50.598 --> 28:52.339
Hold your fire.
They might have hostages.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.604
Take cover!

29:03.437 --> 29:04.394
Coming out the side door.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.619
We gotta get out
of here, Cole.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.229
Get to the trucks!

29:24.763 --> 29:26.634
They're on the run.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.949
All we want
is the Dewey brothers!

29:42.171 --> 29:43.738
The guard's still
15 minutes away.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.827
If we go in, we're on our own.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.394
So are the hostages.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.265
Go tight on me.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.268
Light up anything that moves.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.149
- Don't shoot!
- Where's the sheriff?

30:03.236 --> 30:04.193
Back here.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.629
On your knees, cowboy!

30:09.198 --> 30:11.766
- Are you okay?
- I am now.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.858
The ranchers just
turn tail on the Deweys?

30:16.945 --> 30:18.381
Looks that way.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.122
That last salvo
was covering fire.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.561
That's Katy Austin.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.041
We got her through
and through to the hamstring.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.390
She lost a lot of blood,
but she's lucky.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.523
Missed the femoral artery.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.394
Give me a phone,
and I'll call for an ambo.

30:31.481 --> 30:33.135
What about Garrett?

30:33.222 --> 30:34.615
Where is he?
- Hey, Remy.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.890
Oh, no.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.500
Oh, Cole Dewey's lost his mind.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.111
What happened in here?

30:52.198 --> 30:53.939
He convened
the Ranchers' Co-op

30:54.026 --> 30:55.766
to put me and Garrett on trial.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.464
What for?

30:57.551 --> 30:59.292
Doing our jobs.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.684
He must have figured
he looked like some kind

31:00.771 --> 31:03.383
of anti-government folk hero.

31:03.470 --> 31:07.822
Could you ID the ranchers who
participated in this massacre?

31:07.909 --> 31:10.477
I can't swear who was in the
room when Garrett was hanged,

31:10.564 --> 31:12.914
but Will Dewey
turned on his brother,

31:13.001 --> 31:14.655
cold cocked him good.

31:14.742 --> 31:15.917
He might be willing
to cooperate

31:16.004 --> 31:17.484
with the U.S. Attorney.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.792
Let's get him out of here.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.796
The National Guard
set up a position

31:25.884 --> 31:27.711
a mile from here
down the mountain.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.191
Perfect timing,
now we don't need them.

31:29.278 --> 31:30.236
We should head
to their location

31:30.323 --> 31:31.802
given what just went down.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.022
We can use an escort
to the nearest federal lockup.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.894
Fine, put me in jail,
make me a martyr.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.678
By the way, you played
right into my hands.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.723
Remy, we've got company.

31:41.638 --> 31:44.206
It's an ambush, back inside!

31:44.293 --> 31:45.729
Everybody in!

31:59.395 --> 32:00.875
They've got us trapped.
That's the only road out.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.181
Any word from below?

32:02.268 --> 32:03.138
The guard's
in their own standoff

32:03.225 --> 32:04.574
with another group
of armed ranchers.

32:04.661 --> 32:05.967
So they can't get up here,
we can't get down.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.751
The ranchers want Cole.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.624
Maybe we just turn him over,
deescalate all this.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.192
That just leaves somebody
else to clean up the mess.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.368
What if they decide
to wait us out?

32:15.455 --> 32:17.196
We don't have
any food or water.

32:17.283 --> 32:19.111
There's a trail
just to the north of here

32:19.198 --> 32:21.156
through those woods
behind the hall.

32:21.243 --> 32:23.376
I used to hunt elk up
on that ridge with my dad.

32:23.463 --> 32:24.899
It runs all the way
down the mountain.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.509
How far is the trail?

32:26.596 --> 32:28.250
50, 60 yards.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.296
They'll spot us all
on the move.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.427
All right, look.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.516
I'll take Katy out
to the ranchers,

32:33.603 --> 32:35.344
give you guys enough time
to slip out back.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.390
Still too many people.
They'll see us.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.395
I'll take Cole myself.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.744
Once he's in custody,
these ranchers

32:43.831 --> 32:46.138
will stand down with their
leader under arrest.

32:46.225 --> 32:47.922
I think we sit tight,
wait on the guard.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.663
And do what?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.099
Start a war up here?

32:51.186 --> 32:52.840
You don't even know
where the trail is.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.626
I'll go with you.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.280
I can get us to the guard.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.283
Those ranchers have way
too much firepower to risk it.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.677
I'm still the law
in this county.

33:03.764 --> 33:06.636
If I can't stand up
to these men now, I'm useless.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.725
The sheriff and I will
run Cole down this mountain.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.510
The rest stay here.

33:10.597 --> 33:11.598
Ray, make sure it's safe
then take her outside.

33:11.685 --> 33:14.862
Cover his ass in case
this goes sideways.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.560
We're about to go on
a little walkabout, Mr. Dewey.

33:17.647 --> 33:20.781
If you make any effort
to alert your friends,

33:20.868 --> 33:22.696
I will shoot you
where you stand.

33:22.783 --> 33:23.914
Understood?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.916
Spoken like a true jackboot.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.397
I'll take that as a yes.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.148
Where's Cole?

33:40.235 --> 33:42.194
Your friend's bleeding out.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.195
You need to get her
to the hospital.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.851
We need to see Cole.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.549
Make sure he's unharmed.
- He's fine.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.420
- Show us!
- You can deal with that later.

33:51.507 --> 33:52.856
If you don't do something
right now,

33:52.943 --> 33:53.814
she's gonna die out here.

33:57.774 --> 34:00.473
Come down off the porch.
Hand her over.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.440
You're coming too,
till we get Cole.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.660
Get your hands off me.

34:26.977 --> 34:29.067
We're on the trail.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.459
Everyone okay down there?

34:30.546 --> 34:31.678
<i>Ray had a moment,
but we're good.</i>

34:31.765 --> 34:33.375
Stop stalling.

34:33.462 --> 34:35.029
Listen to every word I say
or I'll ran my jackboot

34:35.116 --> 34:36.639
straight up your ass.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.130
The ranchers have
the guard boxed out.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.177
Stand down.
Put your weapons down.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.526
We're gonna
have to sidestep them

34:53.613 --> 34:55.005
or we're gonna walk
right into their blockade.

34:55.093 --> 34:55.832
What's the plan?

34:55.919 --> 34:57.486
Uh.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.358
There is another way
to the flats.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.099
If we can cross through here
without them seeing us,

35:01.186 --> 35:02.883
then we're home free.

35:02.970 --> 35:03.840
Let's do it.

35:05.799 --> 35:06.843
Stand down.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.856
End of the line, folks.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.208
How you holding up, Cole?

35:23.295 --> 35:24.992
I've been better.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.385
Come get these
damn cuffs off me.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.692
Sam, get the keys
from the nice officer.

35:29.779 --> 35:32.130
We got four
federal agents on our heels.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.871
You really wanna die
for this blowhard?

35:37.787 --> 35:40.486
Hey, those Feds
still up there with you?

35:40.573 --> 35:41.443
<i>Affirmative.</i>

35:41.530 --> 35:44.446
<i>We've got 'em pinned down.</i>

35:44.533 --> 35:46.927
Hand those keys to my son, now.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.755
That's not gonna happen.

35:48.842 --> 35:52.237
He just executed a man,
and you let him do it.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.456
Well, that's between us
and our maker.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.590
Cole won't get a fair shake
in a federal court.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.983
Then it looks like
we got ourselves a big problem.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.770
No doubt.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.170
How's the new baby, Tom?

36:16.739 --> 36:19.525
What'd you and Linda
name the little fella?

36:19.612 --> 36:21.744
Huh?

36:21.831 --> 36:25.183
Lester, I'm real sorry
to hear about your mom.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.668
Now, come on, boys.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.192
She quit being your
neighbor the moment

36:34.279 --> 36:35.410
she put that star on her chest.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.331
That steal you made
at the end

36:43.418 --> 36:45.768
of the Star Valley game, whew!

36:45.855 --> 36:47.466
That was something.

36:50.860 --> 36:53.298
You--you going out
for football next year?

36:58.085 --> 36:58.955
Cornerback.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.326
Blake!

37:21.413 --> 37:22.936
What the hell
are you doing, man?

37:23.023 --> 37:25.591
Ain't nobody else
gonna die out here, Cole.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.595
We used to be in the right.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.861
Not anymore.

37:54.141 --> 37:56.056
Sheriff Franklin
and the Wyoming State Police

37:56.143 --> 37:58.841
rounded up all the ranchers who
took part in the bogus trials.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.539
Well,
when they're done with that,

38:00.626 --> 38:02.454
they can go after those idiots
that ambushed us.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.847
I, for one,
will be happy to make IDs.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.588
I'm sure we all will.

38:06.675 --> 38:09.330
Hey, Hana, I'll be having
dinner with Cora tonight.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.941
- Okay.
- All right.

38:12.028 --> 38:14.074
Have a good night, ladies.
- Good night, everyone.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.336
Great job today.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.428
Great job today.
- You too.

38:30.743 --> 38:33.528
Thanks for sticking up
for me today.

38:33.615 --> 38:34.355
Of course.

38:40.796 --> 38:43.146
Kristin, we really don't
have to do this tonight.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.713
Tonight's perfect.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.975
Ingrid's staying the night
at a friend's,

38:46.062 --> 38:48.456
and I've been jonesing
for a cacio e pepe, so.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.289
You wanna tell me
what happened?

38:59.032 --> 39:01.382
Ever since I was abducted
by those pedophiles

39:01.469 --> 39:04.385
in New Hampshire,
I've been, uh,

39:04.472 --> 39:06.256
moonlighting,
I guess you could call it.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.128
Doing what?

39:08.215 --> 39:10.522
I hunt for predators online

39:10.609 --> 39:13.699
who are looking
for young girls.

39:13.786 --> 39:16.615
Last week I catfished
a guy named Graham.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.531
I met him for dinner
with who he thought

39:19.618 --> 39:24.753
was a 13-year-old girl
and blew up his life.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.755
How?
You went to the police?

39:26.842 --> 39:28.278
No.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.628
All the dirt that I had on him,

39:29.715 --> 39:32.195
I sent to his friends
and family.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.588
Then today...

39:36.286 --> 39:39.420
He must have
put it on auto-send

39:39.507 --> 39:42.118
before he pulled the trigger.

39:42.205 --> 39:43.990
Hana.

39:44.077 --> 39:45.557
I was careful.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.689
He didn't have
any idea who I was,

39:47.776 --> 39:49.517
and I didn't do
anything illegal.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.911
But you're dancing
in the gray area there.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.566
I really don't need you
to judge me.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.307
I'm not judging you,
I promise.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.355
I--I just wanted to know
what it felt like

40:01.442 --> 40:03.792
to be in control again.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.055
And if I'm honest,
it felt good.

40:06.142 --> 40:09.972
I didn't know
he was gonna kill himself.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.583
But if there's one less
monster in the world

40:11.670 --> 40:14.629
then I'm sorry
that I'm not sorry.

40:19.112 --> 40:21.984
You don't understand.

40:22.071 --> 40:22.985
Yeah, I do.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.944
No, you don't.

40:25.031 --> 40:25.814
Nobody does.

40:30.515 --> 40:31.472
I'm gonna
show you something.

40:35.302 --> 40:37.783
You see those scars?

40:37.870 --> 40:38.784
Oh, my God.

40:42.265 --> 40:43.832
I'm so sorry.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.486
No.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.096
You don't need to be sorry.

40:47.183 --> 40:50.926
You don't even need
to know what happened.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.624
You need to know that
you're not alone...

40:55.191 --> 40:58.934
That all that pain
and helplessness and ugliness

40:59.021 --> 41:01.241
and rage is part of it.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.812
It doesn't go away.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.210
So what do I do?

41:19.999 --> 41:23.393
You're doing it.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.831
Right now. You talk about it.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.136
You look at it,
you deal with it,

41:27.223 --> 41:28.442
and you do everything you can

41:28.529 --> 41:30.183
not to let it interfere
with the job.

41:32.185 --> 41:34.666
Look, I get it.

41:34.753 --> 41:37.277
Plenty of nights--
plenty of nights

41:37.364 --> 41:38.844
I came home and went straight
for the bottle, too,

41:38.931 --> 41:40.498
believe me.

41:42.891 --> 41:45.894
But you gotta
break the pattern.

41:45.981 --> 41:48.288
One step at a time,
and I know you can do it.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.647
Who else knows
about this Graham?

41:59.734 --> 42:01.083
Nobody.

42:01.170 --> 42:03.433
Just you.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.523
I think we keep it that way.

42:07.263 --> 42:11.703
Kristin, thank you.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.226
Yeah.

42:13.313 --> 42:15.141
I've got you.
