08:30.778 --> 08:33.847
I joined a nationwide study
analyzing a flextime schedule.

It found that as long
as a weekly max of 80 hours

If you're all done debating,
this boss could use some help.

There are lesions
on her ovary.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.932
That wasn't visible
on the imaging.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.466
DR. MELENDEZ: It's small.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.635
We can excise it without
damaging the ovary, but...

10:36.336 --> 10:37.537
There are others.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.408
Her bowel, bladder, uterus.

in so much pain.

with the Fallopian lesions

Why not Park?

better at talking

DR. PARK: No idea.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.116
Just one of those days.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.456
I didn't mean one
of "those" days.

on the conversation

is worth it.

didn't give you
the Winter's idea.

The text wasn't

It was from Lea.

your authority

Dr. Browne's supposed PMS.

I never said you had PMS.

more irritable than usual.

and I'm not a whiner!

27:21.540 --> 27:23.609

Andrews. This was your idea.

it's you.

You're 12 hours
into an operation

27:28.480 --> 27:30.482

was gonna take one,

27:30.516 --> 27:31.951
you're all more irritable
than usual.

you took a little break.

I expect everyone in this OR

the utmost professionalism.

Please,
just tell me what to do.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.820
(SCOFFS)
I met her yesterday.
I barely know her.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.822
So you can be objective.
You... You can
make the right call.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.358
No, Gina didn't choose someone
to be objective.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.493
She chose you.
Please, just tell me
what to do.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.228
I can't.
You have to!
Because I won't.

33:17.463 --> 33:18.964
I can't do that to her.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.801
Please. Just...
Just help me.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.406
Whatever you say, that's...
That's what I'll do.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.008
Whatever you say.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.312
**

33:36.648 --> 33:38.517
SHAUN:
Do you feel sorry for me?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.452
DR. LIM: Why would I?

33:40.486 --> 33:43.989
Morgan says Lea
is only nice to me

33:44.022 --> 33:46.358
because she feels sorry
for me.

33:46.392 --> 33:49.361
Does Morgan have a theory for
why Morgan is so nice to you?

33:49.395 --> 33:51.663
I'm being honest,
which is better than nice.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.700
Cut this fibrinous tissue.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.001
DR. REZNICK: Bipolar.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.338
Some women put a guy
in the friend zone

33:59.371 --> 34:01.507
and they end up treating him
more like a pet than a person.

34:02.908 --> 34:05.344
DR. LIM: Morgan has a point.
Some women do that.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.080
But the only way to
find out if Lea does that
is to talk to her.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.082
The wound is clean.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.850
No more macroscopic signs
of infection.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.385
Any spinal nerve damage?

34:13.419 --> 34:15.354
Won't be able to tell
until he wakes up.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.891
**

34:34.706 --> 34:37.209
DR. MELENDEZ:
What'd he decide?

34:37.243 --> 34:38.844
CLAIRE: He didn't.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.079
He refused
to make a decision.

34:41.113 --> 34:44.783
He, um, insisted that
I do it for him.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.259
She really wants
to be a mom,

34:53.292 --> 34:55.227
so I think that
we should try to...
No.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.897
He chose me
to make the decision.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.111
Her life matters more
than a dream.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.582
Do a full hysterectomy.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.593
You're right.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.727
Let's go.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.429
She's already been under
for 22 hours

35:30.462 --> 35:32.130
and we got a lot more work
to do.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.299
Metz and a forcep.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.503
(INSTRUMENTS CLATTER)

35:41.440 --> 35:42.941
DR. MELENDEZ:
Cut the uterosacral ligament.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.414
Large pan.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.482
**

35:53.719 --> 35:54.786
Time?

35:54.820 --> 35:57.323
JL: 4:10. She's been under
26 hours, 10 minutes.

35:57.356 --> 36:00.091
DR. MELENDEZ:
All right, let's close her up
so we can wake her up.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.827
CLAIRE: I'll go
tell the husband.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.729
No. I'll do it.

36:06.031 --> 36:07.566
Dr. Browne, you take lead
on the close.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.036
**

36:14.506 --> 36:16.275
DR. LIM: Wiggle your toes.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.143
**

36:22.281 --> 36:23.649
All 10 are going to market.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.517
You're gonna be fine.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.953
And, uh,
w-what about my...

36:27.986 --> 36:29.588
He'll be fine, too.

36:30.656 --> 36:31.690
Thank you.

36:31.723 --> 36:32.991
Oh, don't thank me.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.626
Those two are the ones
who saved you.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.662
All on their own...

36:36.695 --> 36:37.729
Almost.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.706
**

37:11.863 --> 37:13.265
What happened?

37:15.033 --> 37:19.671
The endometrial lesions
were much more invasive
than we saw on the imaging.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.873
In order to remove them all,
we needed to reconstruct

37:21.907 --> 37:24.242
a new bladder out of a section
of your intestine.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.279
And we had to
remove your uterus.

**

37:34.553 --> 37:36.054
Honey, I am so sorry.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.963
It's gonna be okay.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.537
I love you so much.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.139
I love you, too.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.553
Now that we've handled
the surgical crisis,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.921
it's time we deal with
the unprofessional behavior.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.693
The only question I have is,
who exactly is to blame?

38:19.598 --> 38:21.232
It was
a 27-hour surgery.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.370
There were
some tense moments.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.137
But I was very pleased
with how everyone

38:26.171 --> 38:27.606
ultimately worked together
as a team.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.445
I was especially impressed
with how Dr. Browne

38:33.479 --> 38:37.416
aggressively stood her ground
and insisted

38:37.449 --> 38:39.418
that I respect the husband's
final decisions

38:39.451 --> 38:40.719
regarding his wife's
hysterectomy.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.160
Is there anything
the two of you
would like to share?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.330
No.
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:52.364 --> 38:53.499
I'm good.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.138
Well,
I'd like to say...

39:02.708 --> 39:08.179
I was very impressed
with Dr. Melendez's openness

39:08.213 --> 39:11.883
to hearing input from all
of the surgical team.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.852
It's definitely something
all of us

39:13.885 --> 39:15.887
on the nursing staff
appreciate.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.494
Very good.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.298
Go home, get some rest.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.089
You're here.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.591
Yeah, I am.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.073
I shouldn't have
told you to go away.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.579
It wasn't very nice
and you've always
been nice to me.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.550
You've been a good friend.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.591
If you want to talk,
I will listen.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.394
**

40:30.896 --> 40:34.733
You're right.
I have been a good friend.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.435
Actually, I've been
an awesome friend,

40:37.469 --> 40:38.870
but you have been
a total jerk!

40:39.905 --> 40:42.373
You are so worried
about me hurting you?

40:42.407 --> 40:43.875
What about
how you hurt me?

40:43.909 --> 40:46.077
What? You think you're
the only one who has feelings?

40:46.111 --> 40:48.279
You think you're the only one
who needs someone

40:48.313 --> 40:51.082
who doesn't judge them,
doesn't make them feel
totally alone,

40:51.116 --> 40:52.684
like there's not one person
in the world

40:52.718 --> 40:53.952
who actually gives
a damn about them?

40:53.985 --> 40:55.220
Okay. I'm sorry.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.321
No, you're not!

40:56.354 --> 40:57.856
You're... You're just
uncomfortable

40:57.889 --> 40:59.257
and you're trying to
get me to shut up.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.391
Which, don't worry, I will.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.760
Just as soon as I finish
telling you

41:01.793 --> 41:03.862
that friendship
is a two-way street, Shaun!

41:03.895 --> 41:05.964
A two-way street,
you jackass!

41:10.168 --> 41:11.537
Guess I was wrong.

like a real man.

I know that?

Am I dead?
