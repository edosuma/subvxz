43:52.360 --> 43:54.761
Deathstroke has my family.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.129
He says he'll kill them if
I don't do what he wants.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.560
Where is Deathstroke?

43:59.720 --> 44:02.326
I don't know.
You have to believe me.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.211
- I'll make you talk.
- BATMAN: Robin, no.

44:10.680 --> 44:12.523
(GRUNTING AND YELLING)

44:17.600 --> 44:20.126
- No swords.
- Fine.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.166
Ha, ha. That was fun.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.441
Which way?

44:45.480 --> 44:47.562
- Time to retreat.
- I'm no coward.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.688
BATMAN: Don't be stupid.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.404
Come on.

45:02.520 --> 45:04.249

46:48.440 --> 46:49.771
BATMAN: Robin.

46:52.960 --> 46:55.201
Huh. Lucky.

47:03.280 --> 47:06.045
- Where am I?
- Just start talking.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.044
Ra's wanted me to splice
animal DNA to human...

47:09.200 --> 47:11.123
using advanced mutagens.

47:11.280 --> 47:14.682
He would provide volunteers
for me to work on.

47:14.840 --> 47:17.320
Obviously, you took him up on it.

47:17.520 --> 47:21.320
I knew it would mean prison if anyone
discovered I was up to my old experiments.

47:21.800 --> 47:25.168
But how do you say
no to Ra's al Ghul?

47:25.360 --> 47:28.603
He wanted you to make
the ultimate warriors.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.569
Yes.

47:30.960 --> 47:34.487
Ra's called it
Operation Air Strike.

47:34.640 --> 47:38.281
No military could withstand an army
of flying super-powered ninjas...

47:38.440 --> 47:40.488
using sonar in the dead of night.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.210
But Deathstroke took over.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.283
The formula was my ace in the hole.

47:44.440 --> 47:48.206
I kept working on it,
making improvements.

47:48.360 --> 47:51.330
If I completely finished it,
I didn't know what he might do.

47:51.480 --> 47:52.686
Where's your family?

47:52.840 --> 47:56.640
I don't know. He let me speak
to them once, briefly.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.282
My daughter mentioned
something about snow.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.086
Uh, two mountain peaks that
she said looked like cat ears.

48:04.280 --> 48:06.601
Interlaken, Grandfather's compound.

48:06.760 --> 48:09.047
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

48:09.960 --> 48:12.281
Can you make an antidote
to the Man-Bat formula?

48:12.480 --> 48:14.482
With the right materials,
the right equipment?

48:14.960 --> 48:17.486
It's possible,
but what about my family?

48:18.200 --> 48:20.202
Leave them to us.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.805
DEATHSTROKE:
I know where you took the boy.

48:51.040 --> 48:53.247
He fights like an assassin.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.084
Like you.

48:55.280 --> 48:58.409
Your romance with the Dark
Knight wasn't merely rumor.

48:58.560 --> 49:01.291
Who is he? Who is Batman?

49:01.440 --> 49:02.726
Do what you must.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.648
I won't talk.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.088
I believe you.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.527
TALIA: Besides, you won't
need to look for them.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.205
They'll find you first.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.601
Works for me.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.004
- BATMAN: I hope you're right about this.
- I know these mountains well.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.208
I've been climbing
them since I was 4.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.930
It was a part of my training.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.082
That's some training
for a 4-year-old.

49:28.240 --> 49:31.050
First time I climbed,
I fell. Broke my wrist.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.964
I made it to the top anyway.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.929
It was expected.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.401
I was Ra's al Ghul's grandson.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.929
Was it all like that, Damian?

49:40.120 --> 49:43.090
I was being groomed to lead
humanity, like my grandfather.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.368
We were going to create
a whole new world.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.682
- By killing.
- If that's what it took.

49:47.840 --> 49:51.322
How do you hope to lead humanity
when you've never been a part of it?

49:52.320 --> 49:56.450
What about you? From what I heard,
your childhood wasn't a lot of fun either.

49:56.600 --> 49:59.843
I had my traumas, but I also
had people around me to help.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.004
Alfred, Dick, others.
I had friends.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.490
As far as I can tell, all
you've had are trainers.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.927
There's a difference, Damian.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.489
There's the stronghold.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.927
Beyond those peaks.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.924
Nothing.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.923
Why are we wasting time when it's
obvious they've abandoned it?

50:42.080 --> 50:45.004
Wait. Listen.

Oh, Batman. Thank heavens.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.488
- Where's Kirk?
- BATMAN: Safe.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.969
We've been so afraid.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.690
BATMAN: You're all right now.

51:28.760 --> 51:31.206
REBECCA: Robin, you saved us.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.931
This is totally unnecessary.

51:34.440 --> 51:37.762
Deathstroke said he would spare
us if I gave this to you.

51:40.520 --> 51:43.842
Don't tell Batman. Please.

51:55.240 --> 51:57.641
There's a landing pad on the
other side of this stronghold.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.888
I'll call Interpol to
send a helicopter.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.008
Shouldn't take long.

<i>How's the little prince?</i>

53:02.240 --> 53:03.651
Sends his love.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.609
He just ordered room service.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.048
<i>Maybe he's human after all.</i>

53:08.240 --> 53:09.765
What about Langstrom?

53:09.920 --> 53:13.322
<i>Ever since I told him his family's
safe he's been a scientist on fire.</i>

53:13.480 --> 53:15.562
Once actually on fire.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.963
Something exploded, I had to
put him out. Minor burns.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.884
BRUCE:
<i>But he is producing the antidote?</i>

53:21.040 --> 53:22.371
<i>Hundreds of doses.</i>

53:22.520 --> 53:23.851
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

53:24.240 --> 53:26.083
Deathstroke has Talia.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.323
Langstrom's wife said there
was another prisoner.

53:29.880 --> 53:31.564
A woman.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.684
I think Talia attacked the
stronghold and got captured.

53:34.840 --> 53:37.491
I saw signs of torture
in one of the cells.

belonging to Ra's, part of a shell company...

53:47.960 --> 53:51.123
went active a few weeks back.
I thought that was interesting.

53:51.280 --> 53:54.045

- Close to you.

- How close?
- NIGHTWING: Scotland.

And took his uniform.
