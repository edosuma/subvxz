Um, you really need
to get her to sign it, now.

05:37.593 --> 05:39.468
And you need to move her
to an actual hospital

05:39.551 --> 05:41.468

05:41.551 --> 05:43.092

05:58.051 --> 06:00.926
Do you know how Nostalgia works?

06:01.009 --> 06:02.384
Or how they make it?

06:02.468 --> 06:06.343
You know, they insert these
little chips into your brain,

06:06.426 --> 06:08.301
and they harvest your memories.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.277
And then they put them in
a little pill and you pop one,

06:10.301 --> 06:12.801
and you get to experience
that shit all over again.

06:13.593 --> 06:16.676
It was supposed to be
for older folks, you know,
dementia treatment,

06:16.760 --> 06:20.009
but that limited the market
because, you know,

06:20.593 --> 06:23.134
who wants to be in the present
when you can live in the past?

06:24.551 --> 06:25.885

dependency, ODs.

06:28.885 --> 06:31.092

outlawed it,

06:31.176 --> 06:33.801

that made it had to stop.

06:33.885 --> 06:36.468

who owns that company?

06:37.801 --> 06:39.009
Lady Trieu.

06:39.092 --> 06:40.384
Coincidence.

Hey, maybe she knows
your Grandpa.

06:42.885 --> 06:44.384

Pleasure to meet you.

33:17.967 --> 33:20.635
Uh, this is my wife, June.

33:20.718 --> 33:23.259
Mrs. Reeves. If you
don't mind excusing us,

33:23.343 --> 33:26.426
- I'm hoping to discuss
some business with your...
- Oh!

33:26.509 --> 33:28.092
Business!

33:30.967 --> 33:33.259
How can I help you,
Mr. Gardner?

33:37.009 --> 33:39.843
I'm here on behalf of
a costumed adventurer

33:39.926 --> 33:42.009
named Captain Metropolis.

33:42.092 --> 33:43.509
Have you heard of him?

33:43.593 --> 33:46.092
- Costumed adventurer?
- Yes.

33:46.176 --> 33:50.051
Crime fighting in disguise.
It's a new phenomenon,

33:50.134 --> 33:52.009
but it's growing
at a brisk clip.

33:52.092 --> 33:54.426
Captain Metropolis
would like to capitalize

33:54.509 --> 33:56.967
on that growth
by forming a team.

33:57.551 --> 33:59.635
Patriots, heroes.

34:00.343 --> 34:03.593
They call themselves
the New Minutemen.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.301
It's a great group of fellows,

34:06.384 --> 34:09.551
and there's even
a couple of ladies.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.051
I'm sorry,
but I don't understand

34:15.134 --> 34:17.259
what this has got to do with me.

34:17.718 --> 34:21.301
The team is incomplete without
the hero who inspired them.

34:21.885 --> 34:24.009
Hooded Justice.

34:25.718 --> 34:28.801
Captain Metropolis is
a master of strategy.

34:28.885 --> 34:30.676
He scrutinized
the different locations

34:30.760 --> 34:32.092
where Hooded Justice appeared,

34:32.176 --> 34:34.843
and cross-referenced them
with patrols of local police.

34:35.468 --> 34:37.635
- So, you think he's a cop?
- No.

34:38.509 --> 34:41.134
I believe a cop is
feeding him intelligence

34:41.217 --> 34:43.801
about criminal activity.

34:44.509 --> 34:47.426
But you know all
about this, Officer Reeves,

34:47.509 --> 34:49.301
because that cop is you.

34:52.718 --> 34:54.217
I'm sorry?

34:54.301 --> 34:56.635
I didn't mean that as a joke.

34:56.718 --> 35:00.301
Mind if I ask, is this
strategic mastermind,

35:00.384 --> 35:02.843
Captain Metropolis, blond?

35:03.593 --> 35:05.718
About your height?

35:06.676 --> 35:08.092
I...

35:08.176 --> 35:09.652
I don't understand
what you're implying...

35:09.676 --> 35:13.217
- What does the word
"cyclops" mean to you?
- Not much.

35:14.426 --> 35:16.843
Is it some kind of underground
criminal enterprise

35:16.926 --> 35:18.760
that Hooded Justice
is investigating?

35:18.843 --> 35:20.509
Well, if you consider
the Ku Klux Klan

35:20.593 --> 35:22.843
a criminal enterprise, then yes.

35:23.426 --> 35:25.343
And they're planning something.

35:25.426 --> 35:28.676
Sounds like a job for
the Minutemen all right.

35:30.635 --> 35:33.134
Let's say I do know
Hooded Justice.

35:33.217 --> 35:36.009
- Why should he join your team?
- He shouldn't.

35:39.635 --> 35:43.009
He should join
because brave men like him

35:43.092 --> 35:45.217
are rare specimens.

35:45.967 --> 35:48.384
Why fight alone,

35:48.468 --> 35:51.718
when you could have
true companionship?

35:55.051 --> 35:56.426
Well,

35:56.509 --> 35:59.384
I have overstayed my welcome.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.718
But I hope you do know
Hooded Justice, Officer Reeves.

36:04.676 --> 36:07.468
If only to tell him
what a huge admirer

36:07.551 --> 36:09.718
Captain Metropolis is.

36:10.217 --> 36:13.009
Something tells me
they have a lot in common.

36:17.967 --> 36:21.343
Good evening, Mrs. Reeves.
Again, I am...

36:21.426 --> 36:23.593
so sorry to have intruded.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.384
I'll see myself out.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.760
No.

36:34.843 --> 36:37.843

38:14.176 --> 38:16.885

Captain Blond and

They only care about

39:01.384 --> 39:04.051
I can't take Cyclops down alone.
I need a team to help me.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.635
- I'm your team.
- I know, but I need them, too.

39:09.009 --> 39:12.092
Tell me about

not again...
- Tell me.

39:20.843 --> 39:25.426
I woke up
in the tall grass and...

39:27.301 --> 39:30.384
there was a wrecked car
off in the distance.

39:31.384 --> 39:33.468
Tulsa was on fire.

39:34.343 --> 39:38.217
I thought I was the only person
still alive in the whole world.

39:39.509 --> 39:41.718
But then I heard a cry, so...

39:42.593 --> 39:44.760
I walked to it.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.051
And there was a baby wrapped
up in an American flag,

39:49.134 --> 39:51.801
so I picked it up.

39:52.967 --> 39:54.926
And I said...

39:55.009 --> 39:57.259
- you're okay.
- You're okay.

39:58.635 --> 40:00.801
And she stopped crying.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.967
You stopped crying.

40:06.092 --> 40:09.343
Don't you ever make me
start again, William Reeves.

40:10.426 --> 40:12.009
I won't.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.343

Gentlemen, please welcome
our newest member,
Hooded Justice!

41:22.926 --> 41:24.468
HJ, how do you respond to rumors

41:24.551 --> 41:26.509
that your strength
is supernatural,

41:26.593 --> 41:28.635
like the heroes
in the comic books?

41:29.092 --> 41:30.384
Hooded Justice:
I'm just a man.

41:30.468 --> 41:32.152
Reporter:
Now that you got
a team behind you,

41:32.176 --> 41:35.217
exactly what kind of crime
are you gonna target?

41:35.967 --> 41:38.551
I believe there is a vast
and insidious conspiracy

41:38.635 --> 41:41.635
at play in the city,
and I have evidence

41:41.718 --> 41:43.718
that a secret plan
is being developed by...

41:43.801 --> 41:47.718
A new crime boss who calls
himself Moloch the Magnificent.

41:48.426 --> 41:51.217
Now, this villain is planning
to harness the sun's energy

41:51.301 --> 41:53.176
into a deadly solar weapon,

41:53.259 --> 41:55.676

woman, and child in New York.

excuse us, fellows,

41:58.176 --> 42:00.509

a city to save.

Hey, Reeves.
About time you showed up.

44:18.051 --> 44:20.171
- What happened here?
- Same thing that always happens

44:20.217 --> 44:23.134
when you put a bunch
of animals in the same cage.

44:23.217 --> 44:26.509
Go on in. We need someone
who speaks their language.

45:03.843 --> 45:05.426
Hey there.

45:09.676 --> 45:11.676
- What's your name.
- Lorna.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.468
Lorna.
I'm Officer Reeves.

45:15.301 --> 45:17.760
- Can you tell me
what happened here?
- I don't...

45:17.843 --> 45:21.426
- I-I don't know.
- I can't...

45:22.551 --> 45:25.134
When the picture started...

45:26.509 --> 45:28.967
there was a-a flicker...

45:30.217 --> 45:32.926
a bright light
going on and off...

45:33.635 --> 45:36.426
and the whole room was
full of lightning, and I...

45:36.509 --> 45:38.760
I heard a voice inside
my head and it said...

45:40.509 --> 45:43.635
It told me I had
to... hurt people,

45:44.468 --> 45:46.593
and I think...

45:46.676 --> 45:48.676
I think maybe I did that.

45:51.259 --> 45:54.259
I heard a voice
inside my head and...

46:03.343 --> 46:05.092
Beware of the Cyclops.

46:07.092 --> 46:09.009
Voice...

46:09.092 --> 46:10.551
inside of my head...

46:10.635 --> 46:12.343
Excuse me.

46:15.967 --> 46:17.635
Will:
I know their plan.

46:17.718 --> 46:19.718
You need to come
down here right now.

46:19.801 --> 46:21.217
Gardner:
Come down where?

46:21.301 --> 46:22.843
Will:
The meatpacking district.

46:22.926 --> 46:24.593
There was a riot in a theater.

46:24.676 --> 46:26.593
Cyclops is using film projectors

46:26.676 --> 46:28.509
to turn Negroes
against each other.

46:28.593 --> 46:30.509
I followed them to a warehouse.

46:30.593 --> 46:35.301
Gardner:
So, this is your vast
and insidious conspiracy?

46:35.384 --> 46:38.885
William, you of all
people should know.

46:38.967 --> 46:42.593
The residents of Harlem
cause riots all on their own.

46:42.676 --> 46:44.885
No, no! This is real!

46:45.760 --> 46:48.426
It's some kind of mesmerism.

46:49.843 --> 46:52.384
That book I found...

46:52.468 --> 46:55.885
- Cyclops is...
- Yes, yes, yes. Cyclops,
Cyclops, Cyclops.

46:55.967 --> 46:58.343
Dear God. So, the Klan

46:58.426 --> 47:01.051
is using mind control?

47:01.134 --> 47:04.967
Do you have any idea how
ridiculous that sounds?

47:05.051 --> 47:06.718
Have you been drinking?

47:06.801 --> 47:10.384
- No.
- Well, maybe you should be.

47:10.468 --> 47:13.635
Come over. You can bring
your red file and we can
talk about it.

47:13.718 --> 47:15.635
I don't want to come over.

47:15.718 --> 47:17.718
You need to get the others

47:17.801 --> 47:20.134
and come down and help me.

47:20.217 --> 47:22.384
You said you would help me.

47:23.384 --> 47:25.217
I'm sorry, William,

47:25.301 --> 47:27.134
but this sort of
thing isn't really

47:27.217 --> 47:29.217
the Minutemen's cup of tea.

47:29.301 --> 47:30.926
I'm afraid you're
going to have to solve

47:31.009 --> 47:34.092
black unrest all on your own.

47:34.176 --> 47:36.967
Now, if you change your mind,
I would love to see you.

47:42.676 --> 47:45.051
Jeez Louise.

47:52.009 --> 47:54.134
Rough day, huh?

47:56.926 --> 47:59.134
What are you doing
down here, buddy?

47:59.926 --> 48:01.635
I know all the cops
who walk this beat,

48:01.718 --> 48:03.760
and you ain't one of them.

48:05.009 --> 48:06.926
Oh...

48:07.009 --> 48:09.259
I know what you're looking for.

48:10.593 --> 48:12.926
Free steaks.

48:13.676 --> 48:16.843
Any boy in blue willing
to put his life on the line

48:16.926 --> 48:19.384
deserves a little gratitude.

48:19.468 --> 48:21.051
Come on.

48:21.134 --> 48:22.801
Let's go to the warehouse.

48:22.885 --> 48:26.176
I'll give you my best cut
to take home to the missus.

48:27.384 --> 48:29.384
Though, from what
I've heard about your kind,

48:29.468 --> 48:32.217
you probably got more than
enough meat to satisfy her, huh?

48:37.885 --> 48:39.801
This your warehouse?
