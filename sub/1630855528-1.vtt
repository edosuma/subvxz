00:51.635 --> 00:56.515
<i>Welcome, Foolish Mortals, to New Orleans.</i>

00:56.682 --> 00:59.560
<i>A most paranormal place.</i>

01:00.727 --> 01:04.857
<i>Where somber funerals end in celebration.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:09.027
<i>Where death is not an ending...</i>

01:09.194 --> 01:11.488
<i>but a new beginning.</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:16.702
<i>And even grief can be a doorway to joy...</i>

01:17.369 --> 01:20.873
<i>if one is willing to walk through it.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:29.381
It's 11:58! Let's get ready.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.848
- Wow.
- Hey, excuse me, bartender.

01:39.391 --> 01:43.604
Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, bartender.
Can I get a drink? Okay.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.022
Here.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.649
You can have mine.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.444
Then you won't have any.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.237
That's fine, I'm not drinking much.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.907
Maybe we could share it.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.241
Yeah.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.452
Are you here with somebody?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.536
Yes.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.913
I am here with my co-workers...

02:01.079 --> 02:03.498
who are right behind me,
I'm sure, being very awkward.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.085
What is it that you do?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.213
I'm an astrophysicist.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.673
That's like...

02:11.840 --> 02:13.592
a rocket scientist.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.553
- More "optics." I create lenses.
- Optics.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.431
For instance, I'm currently working
on a formula to map dark matter...

02:19.598 --> 02:21.517
by combining instructions
we already have in place...

02:21.683 --> 02:23.227
with what we're learning
from quantum mechanics...

02:23.393 --> 02:24.394
and it's really quite complicated, but...

02:24.561 --> 02:27.105
Yeah, sounds like
you're trying to see the unseen.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.316
That's exactly what I'm doing.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.984
But you said it in a much better way.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.362
Okay, I kind of...

02:33.862 --> 02:35.489
I kind of do the same thing.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.032
I give ghost tours.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.869
So, you don't do the same thing at all.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.330
Not at all, but it's kinda like it.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.750
I help people see things
they can't always see.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.502
Like ghosts flying through the air.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.711
- Apparitions...
- Ten!

02:49.878 --> 02:51.547
- ...spirits flying through walls...
- Nine! Eight!

02:51.713 --> 02:53.882
- ...and possessing people.
- You're making fun of me...

02:54.049 --> 02:55.175
Seven!

02:55.342 --> 02:57.469
- ...but come on one of my tours.
- Six! Five!

02:57.636 --> 02:58.720
- Yeah.
- Four!

02:58.887 --> 02:59.721
Yes.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.975
Three! Two! One!

03:03.433 --> 03:05.394
Happy New Year!

03:08.438 --> 03:09.439
I'm Ben.

03:10.983 --> 03:11.984
Alyssa.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.403
<i>Ben?</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:17.364
<i>Ben!</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:24.037
Ben?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.918
Listen, I hate to pile on top of
what I assume is a bad day...

03:30.085 --> 03:31.503
but this thing isn't working.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.548
What makes you think I'm having a bad day?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.175
Why am I assuming
that you're having a bad day?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.177
'Cause you smell like yesterday.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.680
Here.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.975
How many are out there?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.269
- Seven.
- Okay, seven.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.104
Why are you still leading her tour?

03:49.271 --> 03:50.647
Look, I can sneak you out the back.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.566
No, they'll follow me.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.360
They always do.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.778
Yeah.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.074
Are you Ben, our tour guide?

04:01.283 --> 04:03.327
- Yes, I am.
- I'm from Syracuse.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.787
Great, we're gonna read some names.
That's what we're gonna do.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.165
And I wanna hear H-E-R-E, the word "here"...

04:08.332 --> 04:10.083
and that's the only word I need to hear,
got it?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.670
- So it looks like we have a "John Peluso"?
- Present.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.422
Been an accountant for almost 50 years.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.673
I don't care.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.926
It looks like we also have a Carol...

04:19.091 --> 04:20.177
Here!

04:20.344 --> 04:22.095
I'm a Carol. Are you a Carol?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.265
Yeah, I mean, that's so funny!

04:25.766 --> 04:28.227
Carol's a very common name.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.069
Isn't this building supposed to be haunted?

04:37.236 --> 04:39.947
This is an historical walking tour.
Hey, hey, hey.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.157
I will show you things,
and I will talk about them.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.367
No ghost stories.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.957
So...

04:50.582 --> 04:53.710
I hear that this cathedral here...
That has ghosts.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.337
No such thing as ghosts.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.755
I believe in ghosts.

04:56.922 --> 05:01.885
My aunt Barbara, she was an avid birder
and she adored hummingbirds.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.555
Day of her funeral, what do we see?

05:04.721 --> 05:05.722
A hummingbird!

05:05.889 --> 05:07.391
Okay, Carols...

05:07.558 --> 05:10.644
let me impart a little bit of truth
on to you.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.022
I've been in every "haunted house"...

05:14.189 --> 05:15.983
in the most haunted city in the world.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.151
I've even been in that building.
Seventy-two hours.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.820
You wanna know what I found?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.448
Nothing. Not a thing.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.702
Ghosts don't exist. Life is dirt.
We're all dirt!

05:32.499 --> 05:33.500
Sorry...

05:33.917 --> 05:35.169
I'm sorry.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.421
All right, come on.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.495
Welcome home.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.168
Hey.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.505
It's the movers.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.216
Yeah, we're here. How close are you?

07:04.383 --> 07:07.219
How are you four hours behind?
We left at the same time.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.640
Yeah.
No, I understand a lunch break...

07:11.807 --> 07:13.892
but this sounds a little bit more
like dinner and a movie.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.688
We'll see you when we see you.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.148
These movers.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.068
Travis?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.237
I'm over here, Mom.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.698
Just checking out the house.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.337
It's time. It's time. Someone's here.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.714
Places everyone. Places.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.344
He can see us.

08:05.277 --> 08:08.447
This place is going to be great
when we fix it up.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.161
Wow.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.704
You want to pick out your room?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.749
It's probably upstairs.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.084
- Love it?
- No.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.162
Not today.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.535
Welcome home!

09:42.124 --> 09:43.876
No, no, no!

09:53.135 --> 09:54.303
Pumpkin. What's wrong?

09:54.469 --> 09:56.555
This place is haunted!

09:56.722 --> 09:57.848
All right, now, hang on.

09:58.015 --> 10:01.518
Now, I know this place
isn't as warm as I had hoped.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.938
But I think we get some daylight in here,
it's gonna feel better.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.860
Hey, I'm gonna light a vanilla candle
and it's gonna be a game changer.

10:10.694 --> 10:11.820
Will it though?

10:12.863 --> 10:16.074
Sweetie, I need you
to give this place a chance.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.784
This is our home now.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.542
Nah. We're out.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.549
No, no.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.427
Come on, get in the car.
Get in the car.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.764
- Seat belts. Safety first.
- Why won't it...

10:38.931 --> 10:40.599
- Slow, slow, you got this, you got this.
- Okay.

10:40.766 --> 10:41.892
- Mommy's got you.
- Okay.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.269
Don't you worry about it,
I love antiques, but not that much!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.907
You'll be back.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.576
You'll be back.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.799
Okay, okay. I got it, Alyssa.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.061
Excuse me, hey, do you know
the guy who lives here?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.522
Yeah. But he's not very friendly.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.404
Hello?

11:40.325 --> 11:42.411
- So, this is how a genius lives.
- What are you doing?

11:42.578 --> 11:44.079
Take it easy, take it easy,
I'm not a thief!

11:44.246 --> 11:46.665
Look. No, the treasures I seek
are in heaven.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.042
What kind of psychopath
just enters someone's house?

11:49.418 --> 11:53.547
I'm sorry, I know opportunity usually knocks,
but sometimes it just can't wait.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.299
- Like right now.
- What?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.634
Why are you...
Why do you have a cat?

11:57.843 --> 11:59.386
- This isn't yours?
- No.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.306
I thought it was yours.
He was beggin' to get in.

12:02.848 --> 12:05.893
Onwards, my furry friend. Onwards.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.229
I guess the little guy just could feel
all the positive energy...

12:09.396 --> 12:10.397
flowin' out of this...

12:11.982 --> 12:13.317
charming apartment.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.444
Should we crack a window?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.906
I'm Father Kent, by the way.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.574
Hi, Kent.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.493
- You mind if I take a seat?
- Absolutely, I mind.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.661
Okay, okay.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.122
Listen, one question and then I leave.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.958
You wanna be a hero?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.252
Pass.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.922
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Goodbye.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.048
Two words.

12:36.215 --> 12:38.008
Spectral Photography.

12:38.842 --> 12:39.843
Yeah.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.345
That catch your attention?

12:41.512 --> 12:43.430
Because it sure caught mine.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.643
Did you really create
a camera strong enough...

12:47.809 --> 12:50.145
to capture something
called the "ghost particle"?

12:50.687 --> 12:53.315
No, I never called it that.
That was the press.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.485
Anyway, I was professionally ridiculed.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.111
Hey, Dr. Frankenstein.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.365
There's a man of science,
and they came at him with pitchforks.

13:01.532 --> 13:02.533
And why?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.076
For trying to create something.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.953
He created a monster, all right?

13:06.119 --> 13:09.206
That, if I'm not mistaken,
killed a few people, I think, right?

13:09.373 --> 13:12.459
Hey, one man's monster
is another man's great Halloween costume.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.963
- Wow, mind blown. Okay, let's go.
- Okay, hear me out.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.215
I got a call from a really sweet woman.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.092
She has a lovely little kid...

13:20.259 --> 13:21.802
and they think their house is haunted.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.221
She wanted me to perform an exorcism...

13:24.805 --> 13:26.849
but what I think we need is...

13:27.015 --> 13:28.267
a paranormal expert.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.019
- I'm a tour guide.
- You're Ben Matthias.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.355
You worked at the Space Center,
building telescopes.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.608
Before that, you were an astrophysicist
at CERN.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.861
Now, you're giving walking tours?

13:39.111 --> 13:42.197
That's like having Michael Jordan
play baseball.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.616
Let's put you in the game where you belong.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.034
Playing the right position.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.245
That woman is probably out of her wits.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.414
There's no such thing as ghosts.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.707
Then what's the harm in just...

13:51.874 --> 13:55.711
You drive an hour north,
you snap a few pics with the ghost camera...

13:55.878 --> 13:57.421
and you put their mind at ease.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.715
I am not driving an hour anywhere to...

13:59.882 --> 14:00.883
She'll pay.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.343
$2,000.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.678
What's the address?

14:05.220 --> 14:06.388
Money talks.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.182
Hey, it talks to me, too. But, shh!

14:08.348 --> 14:09.349
Don't say anything.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.019
The big man upstairs is always watching...

14:12.186 --> 14:14.521
and he keeps me on a really short leash.

14:15.189 --> 14:17.065
- Yeah, not short enough.
- Hey, listen.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.026
My job is having faith...

14:19.526 --> 14:20.819
and I got faith in you.

14:45.469 --> 14:49.640
<i>You know how you and I are so different,
but when we come together it's really good?</i>

14:50.140 --> 14:51.141
<i>Agreed.</i>

14:51.725 --> 14:54.978
Well, this is like a bridge
from what you do to what I do.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.313
Right? So, look, I got this.

14:59.525 --> 15:00.567
What are you...

15:03.237 --> 15:04.238
It's a lens.

15:06.532 --> 15:08.075
- It's a lens!
- Careful.

15:08.742 --> 15:09.701
A quantum lens...

15:09.868 --> 15:12.496
which, if everything works
how it's supposed to...

15:13.080 --> 15:14.873
it'll change our lives.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.914
All right, let's see this here.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.334
What?

16:01.753 --> 16:03.839
Of course, dead battery.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.096
- Ben?
- Gabbie?

16:11.930 --> 16:14.141
- You made it!
- Nice to meet you. Sorry I'm late.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.269
Some fog had come up near the house
and it was weird, but...

16:17.436 --> 16:19.855
- Yeah, about that...
- It's fine.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.607
Wait!

16:22.149 --> 16:24.526
I should warn you
before you step inside the house.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.071
This is bad, this is bad.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.448
As much as I need you...

16:30.949 --> 16:31.825
you can leave.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.243
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, you should leave.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.120
- If you wanna leave, you can leave.
- It's fine, Gabbie.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.830
I'm not afraid of a couple ghosts.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.624
You say that now.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.334
But really...

16:40.501 --> 16:42.586
this could change
the course of your entire life.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.130
Once you come inside, that's it.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.508
There is no going back.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.885
I guess it's just a risk I'm willing to take.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.011
Now, about the money...

16:52.596 --> 16:53.555
Perfect.

16:54.097 --> 16:54.973
All right.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.016
Damn!

16:56.391 --> 16:59.144
- Yes.
- You did not have to give me this much money.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.022
- I don't even know if I can take this.
- No, take it, I insist.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.398
Okay, I'm taking it.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.276
So, why don't you tell me
some more about this house?

17:06.734 --> 17:08.444
It's probably best I show you.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.196
- Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah.

17:10.364 --> 17:11.365
Okay.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.789
Who are they?

17:19.540 --> 17:21.750
Unclear. I've asked around.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.462
There are a lot of colorful theories
about this place.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.507
Okay, well, that's my son.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.636
We sleep in here.
For some reason, it's just safer here.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.097
And it's just the two of you?

17:36.139 --> 17:38.016
Yeah, well, his father...

17:38.725 --> 17:39.893
Hey, pumpkin!

17:40.978 --> 17:41.937
Hey, buddy.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.565
Do you wanna come out and meet Mr. Matthias?

17:46.608 --> 17:47.484
What's this you got?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.152
Line of defense.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.697
In your line of defense, do you have...

17:52.322 --> 17:53.490
Action Guy?

17:54.366 --> 17:56.910
Who's Action Guy?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.662
You know Action Guy, right?

17:58.829 --> 18:00.038
The one with the shoe?

18:00.205 --> 18:01.039
You remember him?

18:01.206 --> 18:02.332
- As a weapon?
- Yes.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.168
He uses the shoe as a weapon.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.588
And he would say, he had a punch line,
he said something, it was...

18:08.172 --> 18:10.340
"Say it again! Say it again, boy!"

18:10.507 --> 18:11.466
You don't remember that?

18:11.633 --> 18:13.051
It's like <i>Abuelita</i> with the chancla!

18:14.136 --> 18:17.389
Maybe it was just at my discount store.

18:17.556 --> 18:18.515
But what about you?

18:18.682 --> 18:20.392
I was a doctor in New York...

18:20.559 --> 18:21.810
and my mother's from here.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.937
And we just wanted to make a fresh start.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.606
I always wanted to come back...

18:26.356 --> 18:27.691
and open a bed and breakfast.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.945
Wow, that's an unfortunate
involuntary reaction.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.572
Do you not like bed and breakfasts?

18:33.739 --> 18:34.948
They're fine. It's just...

18:35.866 --> 18:38.452
honestly I look at it like
a bunch of strangers getting together...

18:38.952 --> 18:40.412
talking to each other, pleasantries.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.539
"How you doin',"
blah, blah, blah, you know...

18:42.706 --> 18:46.335
and really, if I'm being honest,
it totally is my worst nightmare.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.671
Well, that's helpful.
Thank you.

18:51.006 --> 18:54.259
We just, you know,
don't have a lot of family.

18:54.426 --> 18:55.969
Well, I found this place on Zillow.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.222
I thought that this would be
a great way...

18:58.388 --> 19:01.266
for my son to meet
new and interesting people.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.518
He has trouble making friends.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.102
Me, too.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.272
And then things got really...

19:08.023 --> 19:09.316
- bad.
- Terrible.

19:09.858 --> 19:10.609
Yeah.

19:10.776 --> 19:14.154
Anyway, Father Kent mentioned
that you have this special camera lens.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.656
Correct.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.783
Okay, I think we'll start in this room.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.535
Wait, don't use the flash!

19:21.411 --> 19:22.412
And...

19:22.829 --> 19:23.664
why?

19:24.289 --> 19:26.166
They do not like that.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.212
Maybe we start in the dining room
with the photos.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.217
I just...

19:37.386 --> 19:38.512
moved these back.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.100
It's in here now.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.061
Y'all playin' tricks on me, huh?

19:46.520 --> 19:47.938
No, you guys think this is funny, huh?

19:49.273 --> 19:50.732
Playing jokes on me.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.443
I'll check in here for some ghosts.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.945
- No, don't...
- Don't touch him.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.321
Don't touch him.

19:56.488 --> 19:57.489
Nothin'.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.408
- Maybe take a photo?
- Photo?

19:59.575 --> 20:00.576
Right.

20:01.493 --> 20:02.870
That's what I'm here for.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.420
It's not doing it now...

20:11.587 --> 20:14.298
but normally it will turn its head
and follow you.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.092
- It's absolutely terrifying.
- It is.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.386
I mean, I'm frazzled.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.600
And... the basement.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.689
Sometimes, I'll get a sharp pain...

20:30.856 --> 20:34.443
on both of my sides
when I walk this way.

20:36.653 --> 20:37.988
So, gonna do it.

20:40.449 --> 20:41.450
Okay.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.203
Okay.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.747
All right.

20:46.914 --> 20:50.209
Hey, if you wanna just go back downstairs
and wait for us in your tent, that's okay.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.293
- Okay, honey?
- No.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.128
I wanna do this.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.796
Okay, I got you. Mommy's got you.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.257
You can do this.

20:57.716 --> 20:58.967
My brave boy.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.100
Okay! Okay. I'm here, I'm here.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.727
You're okay, you're okay.

21:09.686 --> 21:10.771
Oh. Baby.

21:12.397 --> 21:15.025
Why don't you just mosey
on over if it's so easy?

21:15.192 --> 21:17.694
- All you have to do...
- You're okay, look at me.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.530
...is one foot in front of the other.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.993
It's really only after midnight.

21:25.661 --> 21:26.662
Right.

21:27.371 --> 21:28.664
Is this guy serious?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.123
Clearly not.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.680
Okay? My big boy.

21:45.889 --> 21:50.227
Okay, I'm just doing some
final calculations here.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.228
Good news.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.063
No ghost.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.732
I know it can be scary.

21:55.899 --> 21:56.900
A big house like this...

21:57.067 --> 22:00.028
creaks in the night, cold drafts.
It happens.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.698
But there's this thing called...

22:02.865 --> 22:04.283
the power of suggestion.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.411
Yeah, I probably just need
to calm down, don't I?

22:07.911 --> 22:08.912
Couldn't hurt.

22:38.483 --> 22:41.486
<i>If ghosts exist, what exactly are they?</i>

22:41.653 --> 22:43.780
<i>Back on</i> Deadliest Catch...

22:43.947 --> 22:48.911
<i>The storm finally got done blowing here.
So we're gonna get started.</i>

22:51.580 --> 22:53.081
<i>On the Bairdi grounds.</i>

22:53.790 --> 22:58.212
<i>Get the rest of these pots on
and call it a Bairdi season for 2018.</i>

22:58.378 --> 22:59.505
<i>And be done, don't you agree?</i>

22:59.671 --> 23:00.672
<i>I do agree.</i>

23:02.341 --> 23:03.800
<i>Two days after setting on the...</i>

23:04.468 --> 23:07.763
<i>For the believers, ghosts are
as real as the living. And ghosts that--</i>

23:07.930 --> 23:11.517
<i>Return to what they hope is their
final Bairdi haul.</i>

23:11.683 --> 23:13.268
<i>Let's go, superstar.</i>

23:16.021 --> 23:21.151
<i>As we'll find out, these orbs,
supposedly the energy signatures of ghosts...</i>

23:21.610 --> 23:23.111
<i>may simply mean it's...</i>

23:23.278 --> 23:25.113
<i>...the average. That'll get us home.</i>

24:09.157 --> 24:10.033
What?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.243
But how...

24:11.410 --> 24:13.704
Hey there! It's Ben, right?

24:17.332 --> 24:19.459
Oh, no, no, no.
Nope. Nope. No. Nope. Nope.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.632
Okay. Let's try it now without the flash.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.527
Power of suggestion.

25:34.826 --> 25:35.827
Bad dream, Ben.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.829
That's all it was.
Just a bad dream.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.626
What is happening?

25:44.962 --> 25:45.963
What?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.674
What, are you following me?

25:54.721 --> 25:57.432
Okay. Everything's gonna be fine.

26:10.404 --> 26:11.405
No, no, no!

26:19.288 --> 26:20.998
Return!

26:43.353 --> 26:44.938
Right on time.

26:52.321 --> 26:53.447
Something followed me home!

26:53.614 --> 26:54.990
Come on, sweetie,
let's get this man some sheets.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.241
Hey!

26:56.742 --> 26:57.910
Hold up, wait!

26:58.911 --> 26:59.745
Don't.

27:00.579 --> 27:02.164
Hey, I said...

27:02.331 --> 27:03.290
something...

27:04.416 --> 27:06.168
followed me home!

27:06.335 --> 27:08.837
When I first caught wind...

27:09.004 --> 27:10.714
of what was going down here...

27:11.340 --> 27:12.341
we were out.

27:12.799 --> 27:16.428
I mean, do you think I'm going
to keep my son in a haunted house?

27:16.595 --> 27:18.138
- No, you're not gonna...
- No, exactly.

27:18.305 --> 27:20.265
But it didn't matter where we went.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.893
These ghosts, and I...

27:24.186 --> 27:26.396
suspect there might be quite a few...

27:27.356 --> 27:28.190
They're like...

27:30.526 --> 27:31.527
bed bugs.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.654
If you step one foot in here,
they just latch on.

27:34.655 --> 27:37.157
We tried leaving the city,
moving from hotel to hotel...

27:37.324 --> 27:39.535
but the hauntings just kept getting
worse and worse.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.954
They forced us to come back here,
much like you.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.164
So, what you could've done
is spoken to me like an adult...

27:44.331 --> 27:45.791
and told me that I could never go home again.

27:45.958 --> 27:46.792
No, no, no.

27:46.959 --> 27:48.627
You walked through that door.
I warned you.

27:48.794 --> 27:50.629
You could have told me
what was happening before...

27:51.672 --> 27:53.173
Hi. Yeah.

27:53.340 --> 27:56.260
You could have told me
before you let me just walk out of here...

27:56.426 --> 27:57.761
I would feel worse...

27:57.928 --> 28:00.806
if you hadn't taken so much money...

28:00.973 --> 28:03.892
just to use a dead camera
and scribble nonsense.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.769
I did do that.

28:06.395 --> 28:07.396
Scone?

28:08.605 --> 28:09.606
Yeah, it's a little late, right?

28:09.773 --> 28:11.275
- They're good.
- They are.

28:13.819 --> 28:15.237
I have a child.

28:16.405 --> 28:18.198
He can't walk anywhere at night...

28:18.365 --> 28:20.284
without a ghost
following him around.

28:21.785 --> 28:25.122
So, I'm sorry, but I will do anything
to protect my son.

28:25.706 --> 28:27.082
I get that...

28:27.916 --> 28:29.168
but you don't need me.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.296
You need an exorcist.

28:33.547 --> 28:34.673
We tried that.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.384
Same thing happened to me.

28:38.427 --> 28:39.970
Oh, my God.

28:40.137 --> 28:42.222
Ben, welcome.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.473
Surprise!

28:44.183 --> 28:46.727
You're in on this as well?
You knew about this the whole time?

28:46.894 --> 28:48.312
You're supposed to be a priest!

28:48.478 --> 28:50.939
What do you want me to say?
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.482
No, you are a monster!

28:52.649 --> 28:54.735
- Hey, you got paid.
- Not enough.

28:54.902 --> 28:56.987
I asked you, are you ready to be a hero?

28:57.154 --> 28:59.281
And what did I say?
I said, "No."

28:59.448 --> 29:00.949
But your eyes were screaming yes!

29:01.116 --> 29:02.367
Okay. Okay.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.995
You said that he was an expert.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.788
- An expert, I'm not an...
- He is an expert.

29:06.955 --> 29:09.333
He just needs a little encouragement
from Coach Kent.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.126
Now does this thing work or not?

29:11.293 --> 29:13.837
Actually, I took a photo.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.636
'Twas blind but now we see.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.513
I wasn't sure at first...

29:23.096 --> 29:26.099
but I think it's that Mariner
from that painting upstairs.

29:26.683 --> 29:27.684
Amazing Grace.

29:28.644 --> 29:29.686
You know what?

29:31.021 --> 29:33.065
Guys, now we can use Ben's camera...

29:33.232 --> 29:35.984
and identify every ghost
in this crooked mansion...

29:36.151 --> 29:38.695
see what we're up against,
make it a fair fight.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.364
Why are we talking about fighting ghosts?

29:40.531 --> 29:41.698
I mean, we should be figuring out...

29:41.865 --> 29:44.326
how we got trapped here
and how we get our lives back.

29:44.493 --> 29:46.495
Look, we're in a fight
whether we like it or not.

29:46.662 --> 29:49.039
I feel like sometimes you're focusing
a little on the negative.

29:49.206 --> 29:51.458
Yeah, 'cause we're never gonna go home again.

29:51.625 --> 29:52.709
See, that's a downer.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.587
Wait, our ghost kept wanting us to return.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.798
Yeah. Mine, too.

29:57.965 --> 29:58.841
Mine did, too.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.343
She was missing half her face,
so it was hard to understand...

30:01.510 --> 30:03.929
but she just kept saying,
"re-worm, re-worm."

30:04.096 --> 30:05.681
Wait, wait, they didn't wanna haunt us.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.601
They want us back here for some reason.

30:12.855 --> 30:14.356
- It's midnight. Hurry!
- Yeah.

30:14.606 --> 30:15.607
What happened?

30:15.774 --> 30:18.026
After midnight,
we all stay together in this room.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.278
It's safer that way.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.655
Father Kent's claimed the blue couch.

30:21.822 --> 30:22.823
Yeah, I mean...

30:23.615 --> 30:24.700
unless you want to sleep there.

30:24.867 --> 30:28.203
It's just I have a bad back
from all the feet that I cleaned in Calcutta.

30:28.370 --> 30:29.288
Take the couch.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.415
Sleep all you want.

30:31.582 --> 30:34.334
If they want us here, I'm gonna find out why.

30:35.002 --> 30:36.378
Hey, where are you going?

30:38.338 --> 30:41.383
You're not supposed to leave after midnight!
You're breaking the rules, stop!

30:41.550 --> 30:42.551
Mom!

30:43.260 --> 30:44.720
These people are...

30:52.936 --> 30:55.480
Hello? Anyone?

30:59.860 --> 31:00.777
Gabbie?

31:00.944 --> 31:01.862
Travis?

31:06.658 --> 31:07.826
Nope.

31:09.995 --> 31:11.079
Nope.

31:26.553 --> 31:28.305
Did I frighten you?

31:28.764 --> 31:30.891
Good, you should be frightened.

31:31.141 --> 31:35.145
He's going to be so excited you're here.
He loves guests.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.191
Ben, are you...

31:40.359 --> 31:43.362
- What?
- Ben, are you okay?

31:46.073 --> 31:47.908
We're gonna need more help.

31:49.076 --> 31:50.827
It's time to assemble the Dream Team.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.621
That's the nickname I'm giving us.

31:52.788 --> 31:54.122
I'm pretty sure that's taken.

31:54.289 --> 31:58.919
First thing we need to do is figure out
what happened in this house.

31:59.086 --> 32:01.797
That's why I've contacted
the foremost historian...

32:01.964 --> 32:04.174
on Greek revival manors in this area.

32:04.341 --> 32:05.509
Now, he's dead...

32:06.343 --> 32:08.846
but I quickly pivoted,
'cause that's what the Dream Team does...

32:09.012 --> 32:11.181
<i>and I discovered there's a professor
at Tulane...</i>

32:11.348 --> 32:14.518
<i>who wrote a book on haunted mansions
in Louisiana.</i>

32:14.685 --> 32:16.228
<i>Only sold about nine copies...</i>

32:16.395 --> 32:18.438
<i>but, hey, he's not dead.</i>

32:18.605 --> 32:19.481
Professor?

32:19.648 --> 32:22.317
Look, if you're coming down here
to talk about your grades...

32:22.484 --> 32:24.152
- turn right around and walk on out...
- No.

32:24.319 --> 32:25.362
...because I'm gonna dock ya!

32:25.529 --> 32:29.491
We're actually not students.
I got a question for you, though, sir.

32:30.075 --> 32:32.953
Do you know anything about this place?

32:35.330 --> 32:37.666
Well, science begins with observation.

32:37.833 --> 32:39.918
<i>So, I'll take pictures
of all of these ghosts...</i>

32:40.085 --> 32:42.212
<i>to make sure we know
exactly what we're dealing with.</i>

32:42.379 --> 32:44.506
<i>Great. And once we know
what we're dealing with...</i>

32:44.673 --> 32:46.592
we're gonna need someone
who can talk to these ghosts.

32:47.301 --> 32:48.260
A psychic.

32:48.427 --> 32:50.929
<i>I did find one within our price range.</i>

32:51.305 --> 32:53.640
<i>She's been doing readings at Bar Mitzvahs...</i>

32:53.807 --> 32:55.809
but gets a very solid Yelp score.

32:58.103 --> 33:00.063
Make yourselves comfortable.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.067
Who is Mitchell?

33:05.194 --> 33:06.486
- I don't know.
- Think a little harder.

33:06.653 --> 33:09.823
I meet a lot of people in my parish,
so I guess it's possible that...

33:09.990 --> 33:11.325
He doesn't know anyone named Mitchell.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.243
What about Giovanni?

33:13.410 --> 33:15.537
- No, I don't think so...
- Gary?

33:15.704 --> 33:17.748
Have you recently met someone named Gary?

33:17.915 --> 33:20.209
Okay, so now we're just thinking of names
that start with "G"?

33:20.375 --> 33:21.710
Okay, so that's a "no" on Gary?

33:21.877 --> 33:24.588
Actually, she's good.
You're very good.

33:24.755 --> 33:27.716
No, I did know a Cousin Gary
in my neighborhood.

33:27.883 --> 33:30.552
- Thank you so much for today...
- You're lying.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.387
You haven't met a Gary.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.390
Have you met someone named Gabbie?

33:42.856 --> 33:46.026
Baby's got to be home before dark!

33:46.193 --> 33:48.612
Why do you have to get home so soon?

33:49.321 --> 33:51.281
Saw those boys chasing you.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.867
They were just running me home.

33:55.118 --> 33:56.453
I think they just need...

33:56.995 --> 33:59.248
a little bit more time to get to know me.

33:59.957 --> 34:01.750
- Yeah.
- I see that you're busy.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.679
That house has a string of traumatic events.

34:14.847 --> 34:15.889
Explosions.

34:16.056 --> 34:16.974
Quicksand.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.391
In Louisiana!

34:18.559 --> 34:20.978
That family might want to move.

34:21.395 --> 34:23.647
Now eat up. Happy Hour ends at 6:00!

34:23.813 --> 34:24.982
Okay?

34:25.148 --> 34:26.149
One more time.

34:27.234 --> 34:28.402
One more time. Open.

34:30.237 --> 34:31.362
Are you kidding me?

34:36.034 --> 34:38.245
So much activity during midnight.

34:38.579 --> 34:39.871
See, I tried to get a read on the ghosts...

34:40.038 --> 34:42.791
but it's hard
because they just won't stop moving.

34:43.542 --> 34:45.168
They're not just moving.

34:45.335 --> 34:48.672
I know this feeling.
They're running from something.

34:50.299 --> 34:52.509
Thank you for inviting me, Father Kent.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.513
Who's reimbursing my mileage?

35:01.768 --> 35:02.853
People...

35:03.729 --> 35:04.938
used to...

35:06.523 --> 35:07.357
eat here.

35:08.984 --> 35:10.360
I told you she's good.

35:10.527 --> 35:12.070
No, it's a dining room.

35:12.446 --> 35:14.948
Sometime after 1788...

35:15.407 --> 35:18.785
the mansion was discovered fully built.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.621
No land had ever been worked.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.873
The earliest record I could dig up...

35:23.081 --> 35:24.416
is this deed...

35:24.917 --> 35:27.628
acquired by William Gracey.

35:29.630 --> 35:33.717
<i>He purchased it
from a previously undisclosed owner.</i>

35:33.884 --> 35:37.179
<i>His wife, Eleanor, died of yellow fever.</i>

35:37.346 --> 35:40.807
That's when things started to get weird.

35:42.100 --> 35:42.976
Isn't this great?

35:43.143 --> 35:46.063
I mean, I've been dying to go to this place
for 60 years.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.690
That's why we came to you,
because you've got a vision.

35:48.857 --> 35:49.942
Guys, I gotta see this.

35:50.108 --> 35:51.860
I'm having heart surgery next week.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.195
You...

35:53.362 --> 35:55.239
- You cannot come.
- I need to come.

35:55.405 --> 35:56.448
- No.
- No, I need to come!

35:56.615 --> 35:59.868
- It's not a good idea. It's a long ways away.
- Sixty years I've tried to get in there!

36:00.035 --> 36:02.120
I can follow you, I've got a car.

36:02.287 --> 36:03.705
Do not come!

36:03.872 --> 36:05.707
Then I guess you don't need these.

36:05.874 --> 36:07.918
All right, all right,
you do what you're doing...

36:08.085 --> 36:10.003
- I'll go use the restroom and...
- Good. Okay.

36:10.420 --> 36:12.297
Run, run! Run! Go, run!

36:12.464 --> 36:14.132
- What? Okay, I'll start the car!
- Go!

36:15.843 --> 36:16.844
Hey, help, help!

36:17.010 --> 36:18.887
So strong!

36:22.266 --> 36:24.351
Fire, fire, fire.
Fire, fire, fire.

36:24.518 --> 36:27.729
If there's an evil spirit here,
only a banishment will do.

36:27.896 --> 36:30.649
And let me tell you, it will fight back.

36:30.816 --> 36:31.859
Ghosts like to fight.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.278
For example, 1813...

36:34.736 --> 36:37.906
a group of mediums went into the house
just a little north of here.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.950
It took 21 days.

36:40.158 --> 36:44.621
They worked their butts off and they got
that deceased owner out of there.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.957
But, they were all found...

36:47.833 --> 36:48.959
How old are you?

36:49.626 --> 36:50.419
Nine.

36:50.586 --> 36:53.839
Okay. I'm talkin' organs on the outside.

36:54.006 --> 36:55.507
- Oh. Come on.
- Nine is young!

36:55.674 --> 36:57.634
It's not that young, girl.
I was drivin' by nine.

36:57.801 --> 37:00.179
Look, I know that might have been
an extreme example.

37:00.345 --> 37:03.056
- Yes!
- But they were a group of amateurs.

37:03.223 --> 37:05.893
I am a professional. Okay?

37:06.059 --> 37:10.814
I'm bona fide and qualified, certified,
and I can get rid of what died.

37:11.106 --> 37:12.149
Well, I don't doubt it.

37:12.649 --> 37:14.860
I've sensed a lot of grief in this house.

37:15.027 --> 37:18.238
And grief, unprocessed,
will make a spirit stuck.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.407
Okay, can you help us unstick them then?

37:20.574 --> 37:21.575
I can do it.

37:21.742 --> 37:23.243
But I would need a week, paid...

37:23.410 --> 37:26.538
where I can recharge my crystals
and begin doing my research.

37:26.705 --> 37:28.248
And then, we can get to it.

37:28.415 --> 37:31.043
I'll send you a invoice from PayPal
in the meantime.

37:31.210 --> 37:32.461
Bye-bye.

37:34.588 --> 37:36.423
Nice meeting you!

37:38.926 --> 37:42.012
<i>You didn't tell me
that these ghosts be following people!</i>

37:42.179 --> 37:44.806
I know your mama
gots to be disappointed in you.

37:44.973 --> 37:46.642
I know she disappointed in you...

37:46.808 --> 37:49.019
'cause I'm pretty sure
she taught you better than this!

37:49.186 --> 37:50.312
I knew this was weird.

37:50.479 --> 37:53.732
All these freaky, different-looking people
living in the same place.

37:54.316 --> 37:55.317
How's she doing?

37:55.484 --> 37:56.568
She's pissed.

37:57.194 --> 37:59.404
What you have done...

37:59.571 --> 38:02.658
is deeply wrong and absolutely unforgivable.

38:03.367 --> 38:06.036
The ghost that followed me home
was on a horse.

38:06.203 --> 38:08.413
Do you have any idea what it's like...

38:08.580 --> 38:11.917
to have a ghost horse...

38:12.084 --> 38:13.669
charging through your bedroom?

38:13.836 --> 38:16.797
Now I've decided to be the bigger person
and help you.

38:16.964 --> 38:19.716
Mostly because you have left me
no other options.

38:20.634 --> 38:21.635
So, tell me...

38:22.261 --> 38:23.971
what happened in this house?

38:26.974 --> 38:29.101
Wow, these are beautiful.

38:29.268 --> 38:30.477
These blueprints that you...

38:31.728 --> 38:32.980
borrowed...

38:33.146 --> 38:34.273
- are incredible.
- Come on.

38:34.439 --> 38:37.609
Am I proud of the fact that Ben attacked
an elderly educator?

38:38.110 --> 38:39.987
Of course not.
That being said...

38:40.404 --> 38:41.780
totally worth it.

38:41.947 --> 38:44.408
These papers say what happened in this house.

38:44.575 --> 38:47.661
Widower Gracey lost his mind
and took his own life.

38:47.828 --> 38:49.997
Suffering from grief.
Didn't I say I sensed grief?

38:50.163 --> 38:52.958
And apparently, he spent all his money
on some psychic or something.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.377
"Medium." We're called mediums.

38:55.544 --> 38:56.587
A medium.

38:56.753 --> 38:57.588
Thank you.

38:57.754 --> 39:00.632
I guess, subsequently after that,
66 people moved into this house...

39:00.799 --> 39:03.719
and each one of them
died a spectacularly terrible...

39:03.886 --> 39:05.304
oddly specific death.

39:06.638 --> 39:08.765
<i>Two brothers shot each other in a duel.</i>

39:09.641 --> 39:12.603
<i>And this wife chopped up
five of her husbands.</i>

39:13.520 --> 39:16.023
So, Gracey must be the key to stopping this.

39:16.607 --> 39:17.900
What was the medium's name?

39:18.650 --> 39:20.235
Madame Leoto, I think.

39:20.402 --> 39:21.987
Madame Leota?

39:22.154 --> 39:25.199
Madame Leota was the greatest medium ever.

39:25.365 --> 39:26.950
Sought after by the royals...

39:27.242 --> 39:28.410
and rich people.

39:28.577 --> 39:29.578
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

39:29.745 --> 39:33.415
This is a letter from William Gracey
to Madame Leota...

39:33.582 --> 39:36.168
asking her to come to his seance room.

39:36.335 --> 39:37.628
But we don't have a seance room.

39:37.794 --> 39:38.670
You sure?

39:38.837 --> 39:39.838
Wait.

39:41.381 --> 39:44.218
There isn't a room
at the end of that hallway.

39:48.722 --> 39:49.723
See?

39:50.349 --> 39:51.350
Nothing here.

39:51.517 --> 39:53.268
- It's just...
- Wait! Hold it.

39:54.311 --> 39:55.354
I got it.

40:08.158 --> 40:09.117
Wow, you just...

40:09.284 --> 40:10.827
- Okay, that...
- Yeah.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.871
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.165
Wait, what? Okay.

40:44.653 --> 40:45.863
Be careful, there's a step.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.866
Smells mildewy.

40:57.833 --> 40:58.834
What's that?

41:02.171 --> 41:03.130
Oil.

41:03.630 --> 41:07.467
Wait, I think I know what this is.
One second here.

41:15.642 --> 41:16.560
Okay.

41:25.777 --> 41:28.113
Oh, my God.

41:29.656 --> 41:31.867
This hasn't been touched in centuries.

41:34.161 --> 41:35.787
Maybe I'll just do a little blessing.

41:35.954 --> 41:38.540
A prayer to get us started on the right foot.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.126
God, give us a break.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.004
We don't want to be haunted...

41:44.421 --> 41:47.090
and it just seems like
there's so many bad people in the world.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.091
Haunt them.

41:48.258 --> 41:51.845
How about an "Amen" at the count of three?
One, two, three, amen!

41:52.221 --> 41:53.055
Amen.

41:53.222 --> 41:54.389
Are you sure he's a priest?

41:55.182 --> 41:58.227
Now, if I can communicate
with William Gracey...

41:58.393 --> 42:02.189
I suspect he will have the answers
that we need.

42:02.356 --> 42:03.524
And just to confirm...

42:03.690 --> 42:08.529
the only thing available to us
is this French Vanilla Yankee Candle?

42:08.695 --> 42:10.280
Yeah, I keep forgetting...

42:11.281 --> 42:13.116
to cancel my subscription to Amazon
so it just...

42:13.283 --> 42:15.118
Please, hold hands.

42:19.957 --> 42:21.667
Now, I will quiet my mind...

42:21.834 --> 42:24.503
so that I can communicate
with the other side.

42:24.670 --> 42:26.547
Please do not interrupt me.

42:26.713 --> 42:28.298
Otherwise I have to start all over again.

42:28.465 --> 42:29.675
Of course.

42:54.658 --> 42:57.452
- She asleep. Look. She asleep.
- No. She's in a...

42:57.619 --> 42:59.288
Hey, she's in a trance.

42:59.454 --> 43:00.622
It's a...

43:01.707 --> 43:03.500
- Wait, is she asleep?
- She's asleep.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.669
- Is she sleeping? Or is it just a trance?
- I'm looking right at her. She's asleep.

43:05.836 --> 43:07.129
Can I do this?

43:07.754 --> 43:09.464
- Okay.
- Now you got me all mad!

43:09.631 --> 43:10.465
We're sorry.

43:11.216 --> 43:12.718
Please do get peaceful again.

43:24.605 --> 43:25.772
Okay, it...

43:27.065 --> 43:28.108
- Why...
- Maybe she's narcoleptic?

43:28.275 --> 43:29.109
I don't...

43:30.402 --> 43:31.737
Who goes there?

43:31.904 --> 43:33.030
Spirits...

43:34.114 --> 43:36.325
I come here with good intent.

43:36.491 --> 43:40.162
I summon the spirit of William Gracey.

43:40.329 --> 43:42.080
If you are here with us...

43:42.247 --> 43:45.167
give us a sign!

43:56.261 --> 43:57.513
He's with us.

43:58.555 --> 43:59.848
Why are you here?

44:00.641 --> 44:02.100
Why are you hanging on?

44:02.851 --> 44:06.021
If you have a message
that you'd like to leave us...

44:06.188 --> 44:07.689
or a greeting of sorts...

44:07.856 --> 44:09.650
here's a pen and pad...

44:09.816 --> 44:12.236
that I purchased from CVS.

44:30.754 --> 44:32.881
Ben, camera!

44:33.048 --> 44:34.800
Go, go, go!
Come on, come on, come on!

44:43.183 --> 44:45.018
Wow! It's Gracey!

44:53.026 --> 44:54.027
He's gone.

44:54.528 --> 44:55.654
What does it say?

44:55.821 --> 44:57.781
"Talk to Leota."

45:02.703 --> 45:05.080
You really can speak to the dead.

45:07.666 --> 45:08.667
Of course.

45:10.377 --> 45:12.379
Can you contact someone for me?

45:12.963 --> 45:13.881
Who?

45:22.055 --> 45:23.098
My wife.

45:25.893 --> 45:28.187
You were the grieving spirit.

45:34.193 --> 45:35.569
Her name's Alyssa.

45:37.321 --> 45:38.238
Yes.

45:41.074 --> 45:42.326
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

45:42.492 --> 45:44.161
I can't.

45:44.328 --> 45:46.121
I don't think she's here.

45:48.790 --> 45:50.167
Could you see if Leota's here?

46:00.844 --> 46:02.262
This feels different.

46:03.388 --> 46:04.973
What does this feel like?

46:05.807 --> 46:06.934
Madness.

46:14.274 --> 46:16.026
Harriet, summon Leota!

46:16.193 --> 46:18.529
I summon Madame Leota!

46:18.695 --> 46:19.821
No!

46:26.495 --> 46:27.579
Come on! Oh, my goodness!

46:28.705 --> 46:30.165
- Help me!
- Harriet!

46:30.332 --> 46:31.959
Okay, okay, wait.

46:32.334 --> 46:34.253
No. Wait, wait, wait!

46:38.298 --> 46:39.967
I wanted to get out of here,
but not like this!

46:40.133 --> 46:41.426
- Harriet!
- Harriet. Come on!

46:44.805 --> 46:45.722
Harriet!

46:46.598 --> 46:47.683
Harriet, come on.

46:49.059 --> 46:50.602
We made it mad!

46:50.894 --> 46:52.980
I did not know it was gonna be a spa day.

46:53.146 --> 46:54.731
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

46:58.318 --> 46:59.194
Is that Bruce?

46:59.361 --> 47:01.280
- Hey! Wait!
- Stop! No!

47:01.446 --> 47:03.115
- Who is this?
- Bruce!

47:03.907 --> 47:06.159
Do not go in, Bruce! Don't go in!

47:08.412 --> 47:10.747
You steal my stuff, leave me flat!

47:10.914 --> 47:12.207
I'll show you!

47:12.374 --> 47:15.502
I will see this house,
and nothing's gonna stop me.

47:22.676 --> 47:23.677
Bruce!

47:24.636 --> 47:25.929
- Help!
- Bruce!

47:28.098 --> 47:29.516
Grandma, you know, Grandma.

47:32.686 --> 47:35.981
I'm too old to die!
It's not...

47:43.655 --> 47:45.449
I'm curious why a man his age...

47:45.616 --> 47:48.160
- was riding a chair down a main road?
- A chair...

47:49.411 --> 47:52.623
- He loves to do that.
- He likes to ride chairs.

47:52.789 --> 47:54.249
- Yeah, it's kind of his thing.
- It's his thing.

47:54.416 --> 47:55.667
I don't like the chair!

47:55.834 --> 47:57.878
Okay, well, let's put a pin in that.

47:58.045 --> 47:59.963
- Make sure he gets lots of rest.
- Rest. Okay.

48:00.130 --> 48:01.632
- Okay?
- Yeah.

48:01.798 --> 48:05.219
And no more excitement,
or next time it might not be a false alarm.

48:05.385 --> 48:08.388
Now, he said that he does live alone,
so I'd like to keep him overnight.

48:09.014 --> 48:11.099
Yeah, maybe get some fluids.

48:12.935 --> 48:14.269
- No, look, look.
- No?

48:14.436 --> 48:15.312
- No. No!
- No.

48:15.812 --> 48:17.022
Oh, my goodness!

48:17.189 --> 48:18.607
- We should go. We should really go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:18.774 --> 48:20.984
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
- We're not going to leave you.

48:21.151 --> 48:22.444
Relax, relax.

48:22.611 --> 48:24.446
We should all go home now.

48:25.739 --> 48:28.325
First he's trapping us here,
now he's dragging us out.

48:28.492 --> 48:30.202
Enough! Make up your mind.

48:30.369 --> 48:31.787
Well, this isn't Gracey.

48:31.954 --> 48:34.957
Whatever evil this is,
doesn't want us to talk to Leota.

48:35.457 --> 48:37.251
It sees us as a threat now.

48:37.584 --> 48:40.254
Let's just go find Leota
and see what she has to say.

48:40.462 --> 48:42.756
Is there anyone that we need to contact
to let them know that you're here...

48:42.923 --> 48:44.049
so they don't worry?

48:44.216 --> 48:45.634
Well, there is a woman.

48:45.926 --> 48:48.053
I make her take my trash down for me.

48:48.637 --> 48:50.806
- She's...
- Yeah, I bet she'll be okay.

48:50.973 --> 48:51.765
- Yes.
- Yeah.

48:51.932 --> 48:52.850
Go on, I don't wanna play now.

48:53.016 --> 48:54.852
- I need to check your pulse. Let me...
- Hey, my love, boundaries.

48:55.018 --> 48:56.186
Go on, go on. Get out of here.

48:56.353 --> 48:57.813
Boundaries.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.858
I'm sorry to hear about your wife passing.

49:02.276 --> 49:03.485
It's good that she's not here.

49:04.152 --> 49:07.072
The living and the dead belong
in different places.

49:08.282 --> 49:09.116
See...

49:10.742 --> 49:12.953
this is our world...

49:13.620 --> 49:15.497
and this is the Region Beyond.

49:16.582 --> 49:18.458
And the place where they overlap most...

49:18.667 --> 49:22.045
is where the living can encounter the dead
through hauntings.

49:22.379 --> 49:23.839
Like this house.

49:24.339 --> 49:28.260
But, when a soul passes
and goes over into the Region Beyond...

49:28.427 --> 49:31.513
if it's at peace, that's where it stays.

49:32.222 --> 49:33.932
It's good that she's not here.

49:34.808 --> 49:36.226
She's at peace.

49:36.727 --> 49:38.896
And I bet she wants you to be too.

49:39.521 --> 49:40.898
I know this might sound silly...

49:41.899 --> 49:46.486
but I believe that souls can send signs
from the Region Beyond.

49:46.653 --> 49:51.116
My father passed away,
and he loved model trains.

49:52.367 --> 49:54.119
He would take them apart...

49:54.286 --> 49:56.538
and put them back together again every day.

49:57.748 --> 50:00.584
But on those days when I get really low...

50:02.419 --> 50:03.921
I mean really low...

50:05.756 --> 50:07.758
I will randomly hear...

50:07.925 --> 50:11.136
a train off in the distance.

50:13.096 --> 50:15.599
And I know that's my dad saying "Hi."

50:19.228 --> 50:20.437
Those moments...

50:21.313 --> 50:22.981
are called ghost winks.

51:14.658 --> 51:16.159
Ben.

51:17.202 --> 51:19.496
Sorry to be so familiar.

51:20.122 --> 51:22.916
I just feel I know you already.

51:23.709 --> 51:26.837
You see, we have a friend in common.

51:28.088 --> 51:29.173
Alyssa?

51:32.926 --> 51:33.969
Alyssa!

51:37.055 --> 51:38.056
Alyssa?

51:39.516 --> 51:41.643
I wouldn't go in there...

51:44.396 --> 51:48.233
unless you want a ticket
to the Region Beyond!

51:50.944 --> 51:52.321
Take us with you?

51:52.487 --> 51:54.907
We know you're heading that way soon!

51:56.033 --> 51:57.075
Alyssa!

52:11.423 --> 52:12.466
Alyssa.

52:16.345 --> 52:18.347
- Ben!
- What, what, what?

52:18.514 --> 52:21.225
Bruce disappeared
and something's happening.

52:29.066 --> 52:30.859
All right, I'm going after him.

52:31.026 --> 52:32.319
All right, here, give me these.

52:32.486 --> 52:33.904
- No, it's after midnight!
- No!

52:34.071 --> 52:35.822
- I got you covered.
- Harriet!

52:35.989 --> 52:37.616
I'm gonna cover us with some morning prayers.

52:37.783 --> 52:39.076
It's the middle of the night!

52:39.243 --> 52:40.494
Not in Rome.

52:51.421 --> 52:52.422
Do you see anything?

52:52.589 --> 52:54.049
No, but I feel something.

52:55.676 --> 52:57.886
Bruce, don't...
What are you doing out here?

52:58.053 --> 52:59.763
We got to find Leota.

53:00.305 --> 53:01.515
What about the attic?

53:03.016 --> 53:06.436
I don't know about this.
Attics are historically terrifying.

53:06.603 --> 53:08.814
Is it cold? It's starting to feel colder.

53:08.981 --> 53:10.732
Well, you don't have any pants on, Bruce.

53:10.899 --> 53:12.234
Can't you guys both just...

53:15.445 --> 53:16.572
Dang.

53:18.532 --> 53:19.408
All right.

53:26.623 --> 53:28.584
- Go on up!
- Bruce, wait!

53:28.750 --> 53:31.879
- Bruce, I need you to protect me!
- Let go! What?

53:32.045 --> 53:33.338
- Bruce, stay here and protect me!
- You have a heart condition. Come on.

53:33.505 --> 53:35.132
All right, all right, all right.

53:35.716 --> 53:36.592
Protect me.

53:38.844 --> 53:39.845
All right.

53:43.515 --> 53:45.058
Be safe up there.

53:49.771 --> 53:50.981
Hello?

53:57.946 --> 53:59.406
Madame Leota?

54:06.163 --> 54:07.581
We need your help.

54:08.415 --> 54:10.959
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

54:13.295 --> 54:14.796
Did you do that?

54:14.963 --> 54:16.507
No, I did not!

54:32.356 --> 54:35.150
Leota? Is that you?

55:00.926 --> 55:02.427
Closer.

55:04.179 --> 55:05.514
Closer.

55:17.234 --> 55:18.235
Oh, okay.

55:18.652 --> 55:19.778
I want out of here!

55:23.240 --> 55:24.366
Holy!

55:30.789 --> 55:32.040
Hey, hey, hey.

55:32.207 --> 55:35.252
Hey, listen, I'm sure those guys deserved
what they got...

55:35.419 --> 55:36.879
but, baby, baby, listen...

55:37.045 --> 55:38.422
I know you can hear me, okay, babe?

55:38.589 --> 55:40.048
Ghost Bae.
Can I call you Ghost Bae?

55:40.215 --> 55:41.800
But me, I'm different. I'm a supporter.

55:41.967 --> 55:44.553
I'm an ally, to you, and to all women...

56:03.071 --> 56:04.907
- It's a little musty.
- Acrid.

56:05.073 --> 56:06.283
- Wow.
- It stinks.

56:06.450 --> 56:07.826
Contaminated.

56:12.581 --> 56:14.374
All right. So, it says...

56:14.833 --> 56:17.836
Here.
"Property of Madame Leota.

56:18.795 --> 56:20.214
"If this does not belong to you...

56:20.380 --> 56:22.633
"Do not turn...

56:23.258 --> 56:24.676
"another page."

56:25.093 --> 56:27.971
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Hey, Harriet!

56:28.138 --> 56:31.808
This is Madame Leota's
personal book of incantations!

56:31.975 --> 56:32.976
Oh, my God!

56:33.143 --> 56:34.311
I mean, one of us had to do it.

56:34.686 --> 56:37.022
Dreams do come true. Oh, my goodness!

56:37.689 --> 56:39.024
Damn, what is that?

56:39.483 --> 56:40.692
That's nice.

56:40.984 --> 56:42.236
A crystal ball.

56:42.694 --> 56:44.530
Is this worth anything?

56:46.573 --> 56:47.574
Hey!

56:48.325 --> 56:50.452
Ma'am, we can see you. Hi.

56:56.959 --> 56:57.918
Madame Leota?

56:58.085 --> 57:00.170
Well, it's about time.

57:00.754 --> 57:03.507
Very powerful book you're holding.

57:03.674 --> 57:06.093
Best know how to use it.

57:06.260 --> 57:07.344
How did you get in there?

57:07.761 --> 57:11.348
I can show you what happened,
but it will cost you...

57:13.517 --> 57:15.060
Three dollars.

57:15.978 --> 57:16.979
- What?
- Wow.

57:17.145 --> 57:19.940
- That's highway robbery!
- That's fine, that's fine. Go ahead.

57:25.779 --> 57:28.907
<i>William Gracey, lost in grief...</i>

57:29.074 --> 57:33.036
<i>sought me out to contact his deceased wife.</i>

57:35.163 --> 57:36.957
Eleanor Gracey!

57:39.251 --> 57:42.171
Rap on a table, it's time to respond.

57:42.337 --> 57:47.217
- Open a bridge to the Region Beyond!
<i>- When she didn't come back to him...</i>

57:47.384 --> 57:50.095
<i>we called for her again and again.</i>

57:50.262 --> 57:53.056
<i>A seance every midnight, for a year.</i>

57:53.223 --> 57:54.933
For a year? That's so reckless.

57:55.100 --> 57:56.059
Who said that?

58:01.190 --> 58:06.195
<i>The repeated seances opened the floodgates
of the ghost realm.</i>

58:06.361 --> 58:09.823
<i>Hundreds of spirits freely came and went...</i>

58:09.990 --> 58:12.034
<i>but never his beloved Eleanor.</i>

58:12.367 --> 58:17.372
<i>I begged him to stop, for fear
of what we might accidentally call forth.</i>

58:17.539 --> 58:19.541
<i>But he insisted we keep going.</i>

58:20.834 --> 58:24.546
<i>Soon, Gracey was receiving messages
from Eleanor...</i>

58:24.713 --> 58:27.883
<i>imploring him to join her on the other side.</i>

58:28.800 --> 58:31.553
<i>But I knew this wasn't Eleanor.</i>

58:32.930 --> 58:35.557
<i>We had summoned a terrible evil...</i>

58:35.724 --> 58:38.477
<i>who fed on Gracey's grief.</i>

58:40.604 --> 58:44.358
<i>This was no ordinary ghost.</i>

58:44.525 --> 58:46.276
<i>He had the power to...</i>

58:46.443 --> 58:51.698
<i>...trap these once happy souls in this house.</i>

59:00.082 --> 59:01.083
Mine!

59:02.042 --> 59:04.086
<i>Before I could get a look at him...</i>

59:04.253 --> 59:07.923
his dark spirit trapped me
in my own crystal ball.

59:08.549 --> 59:10.467
Who knows how long.

59:11.385 --> 59:13.053
Probably months now.

59:15.222 --> 59:19.351
He has trapped 933 souls.

59:19.726 --> 59:23.063
But he needs 1,000 to complete the ritual...

59:23.230 --> 59:25.607
that will let him escape this house.

59:26.400 --> 59:30.487
Beware the full moon,
when he is most powerful.

59:31.029 --> 59:32.906
You won't survive it.

59:34.366 --> 59:36.326
Oh, there's much grief in you.

59:38.120 --> 59:42.124
You will be most vulnerable
to his manipulations.

59:43.792 --> 59:46.086
Not on our watch. We got you.

59:46.253 --> 59:47.462
But what are you gonna do?

59:49.464 --> 59:51.466
- Yeah.
- They're already dead!

59:51.633 --> 59:52.801
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be deader.

59:52.968 --> 59:53.802
Okay.

59:53.969 --> 59:55.929
You know what we need?
We need a banishment.

59:56.096 --> 59:56.972
- Yeah.
- A banishment!

59:57.139 --> 59:58.807
Yes, a banishment...

59:58.974 --> 01:00:03.979
but it requires an object
the spirit once possessed.

01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:05.355
Once you have that...

01:00:05.522 --> 01:00:06.690
Enough!

01:00:14.198 --> 01:00:16.450
We're okay. Let's find a banishing.
Okay, so...

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:18.535
I hate to be the bearer of bad news...

01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:22.372
but there's been 66 deaths in this house...

01:00:22.539 --> 01:00:24.917
since that ball lady was trapped there!

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.961
So, he doesn't have 933.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:30.172
He's got 999.

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:32.925
And unless one of you
wants to start funeral arrangements...

01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:34.426
we better get out of here.

01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:40.641
Shoo! Shoo!

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:43.810
Am I the only one
who didn't know that was real?

01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:49.107
We better hurry this up because
all these seances got the house acting up.

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.945
Never mind that, every one of the deaths
that happened in this house...

01:00:53.111 --> 01:00:54.279
happened on a full moon.

01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:57.616
Which means, we have less than four days.

01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:01.036
Didn't Madame Leota say something
about needing an object they possessed?

01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:04.665
How are you gonna find an object
someone possessed...

01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:06.416
when you don't know
who the "someone" is?

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.753
Now, there is something very special
that I can do.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.338
It's quite extraordinary.

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:15.759
My spirit will leave my body
and go into the ghost realm...

01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:17.886
where I can get a look at that spirit.

01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:19.513
A reverse seance, if you will.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.973
A reverse seance?

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:22.140
Count me in!

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:26.103
Bruce, it's very dangerous.
Not just anyone can do a reverse seance.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.312
Astral projection.

01:01:27.479 --> 01:01:29.106
Just say "astral projection."

01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:31.984
You don't need to use all these words
as if you just invented them.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.652
- It's ridiculous.
- Astral projection?

01:01:33.819 --> 01:01:36.071
Have you ever heard of astral projection?
Is that in your Bible?

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:40.033
- Let's talk about what really is ridiculous.
- Harriet, Harriet, okay, listen.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.160
Come on, we're all on the same team here.

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:45.831
Although we're not actin' like one,
and that plays into their hands.

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:48.250
Hey, I like the idea of a reverse seance.

01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:51.003
Yeah, they've been coming into our realm,
let's go visit them.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.505
You're gonna scare us?
No, we're gonna scare you!

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:54.506
- Yeah!
- Boo!

01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:58.719
Yes!
We will find this evil spirit tonight!

01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:04.057
Just pick the shells out. It's fine.

01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:08.478
You make crunchy scrambled eggs?

01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:11.648
My grandma used to do that back in the day.

01:02:12.024 --> 01:02:15.235
That's when her glasses started.
Her prescription...

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.571
How's he doing?

01:02:18.113 --> 01:02:21.950
I fear he may be a little young
to be processing...

01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:23.911
existential dread.

01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:28.207
You know, I thought that coming down here...

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:31.210
we could put everything that we went through
with his father behind us.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:34.087
You know, he could run around,
be a kid, enjoy...

01:02:34.254 --> 01:02:36.507
but this house just won't let that happen.

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.134
- It's scary.
- No more eggs.

01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:41.428
Speaking of egg-sistential.

01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:43.222
"Egg-sistential"?

01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:47.184
Oh, my God.

01:02:47.351 --> 01:02:49.186
He's gonna fall off that stoop
and break his leg.

01:02:49.353 --> 01:02:51.480
- Travis! Travis!
- Hey.

01:02:51.647 --> 01:02:54.274
Hey, how 'bout I go talk to him?

01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:55.442
Okay, just...

01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:59.321
- don't egg him on.
- Eggs-actly.

01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:02.157
We have to stop this. I'll be back.

01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:03.367
Thank you.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.701
Go team.

01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:18.882
That's him landing.

01:03:21.093 --> 01:03:23.512
That is not how a flying guy sounds.

01:03:23.929 --> 01:03:25.556
You're right. True.

01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:29.685
What's wrong?

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:34.898
Kids at school
are having a birthday party tonight.

01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:37.484
Can't go, of course.

01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:40.529
Not that I was invited.

01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:41.822
- It's crunchy.
- It's crunchy.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:45.367
- There's a lot of crunch in there.
- Yeah, it's like the Cap'n Crunch of eggs.

01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.666
I don't know why they don't like me.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:53.834
I mean...

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.087
I dress my best every day...

01:03:57.254 --> 01:03:59.464
I always raise my hand in class...

01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:02.926
and I make sure everybody
follows the rules on the playground.

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:07.222
Yep, well, I think you just answered
your own question right there.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.434
I talked to my dad today.

01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:14.021
Yeah, that's good.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.482
He wants me to come visit.

01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:23.530
But I think it would make my mom feel bad.

01:04:27.326 --> 01:04:28.327
Don't tell her.

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.246
It'll make her so sad.

01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:36.084
Well, if there's one thing I'm good at,
it's keeping secrets.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.296
And you know what?

01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.759
That was a good one, yeah.

01:04:43.926 --> 01:04:45.969
Just in there kicking me for some reason.

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:48.430
Action Guy.

01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:51.850
Here.

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:54.686
Go ahead, take it. Yeah.

01:04:55.395 --> 01:04:57.481
Be careful. He's cheap.

01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:01.193
I was gonna ask you if you wanted to...
Actually, you...

01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:07.282
"Say it again!"

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:15.374
You got that. All right, you won.

01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.836
- Hey, give me Soulsucker! Hey, come back!
- "Say it again!"

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.172
Dark spirit, whoever you are...

01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:23.924
Harriet's comin' for ya.

01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:25.259
Yeah.

01:05:25.425 --> 01:05:27.594
That's got some mojo to it.

01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:30.931
A little Dragon's Blood? Yerba Santa?
What are we talking about?

01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:32.850
Sage from Costco.

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.561
When I leave my body
to look at this dark spirit...

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.896
I don't want anyone else jumping in it.

01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:40.148
Not that I think it will get to that.

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:42.526
I've done it a thousand times.

01:05:42.693 --> 01:05:45.320
You see, if you say it like that,
it makes me feel like you've never done it.

01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:46.488
Yes, I have.

01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:48.198
I've probably done it, like, 10,000 times.

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:51.410
Why elevate it to that level?
Then I don't believe it at all.

01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:54.371
- How am I gonna get into this?
- Believe it, boo. Believe it.

01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:57.708
Now, if I'm gone for more than 10 minutes...

01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:59.293
ring this bell.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:01.837
If I get lost,
it'll help me find my way back.

01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:06.425
See, I have to be very raw
in order to go into the other side.

01:06:06.592 --> 01:06:09.386
This is a picture of my dog...

01:06:09.553 --> 01:06:13.557
that tragically moved to live on a farm.

01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:16.101
Actually he got hit by a car.

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.438
Bursted like a water balloon.

01:06:19.605 --> 01:06:21.106
- Sis!
- Wait, what?

01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:22.191
What?

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.525
We're gonna start.

01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:28.739
"Spirits, I come with curious intentions.

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:32.409
"Creak open the door to your dimension.

01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:35.662
"Protect my body as I leave this helm.

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.292
"For now, my spirit
will enter the ghost realm."

01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:45.923
Think sad thoughts, think sad thoughts.
Think sad thoughts, think sad thoughts.

01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:29.633
Eleanor?

01:07:30.092 --> 01:07:32.386
Gracey! Hey, we need your help!

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:34.680
You shouldn't be here.

01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:37.891
Hey!

01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:51.363
Gracey, wait! I want to talk to you.

01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:12.259
One, two...

01:08:12.843 --> 01:08:17.848
three, four, five, six, seven.

01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.702
Now, baby, you know I love the blues...

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:41.121
but can you play something a little more...

01:08:42.038 --> 01:08:43.040
light?

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:44.875
This is all he wants to hear.

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:48.127
Keep drinking. It'll get lighter.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.055
Don't let him catch you here.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.106
Eleanor?

01:09:09.733 --> 01:09:10.651
Gracey?

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:12.819
Gracey, you have to help me.

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:15.781
Ben...

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.533
this is all my fault.

01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:19.952
This dark spirit, who is he?

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.578
No one knows his mortal name...

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:23.247
but he's not one of us.

01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:26.959
His power in this realm is beyond control...

01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:29.502
with many of us forced us to do his bidding.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.881
Please, you must not let him
take the last soul.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.259
Or we'll all be trapped here forever.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:37.511
Wait.

01:09:37.678 --> 01:09:38.679
He's coming now.

01:09:38.929 --> 01:09:40.555
- Leave now!
- Gracey!

01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:45.269
Oh, no, he's here!

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:47.645
Follow me.

01:09:47.813 --> 01:09:49.231
- This way!
- He's here.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:51.191
Take my hand!

01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:52.317
Hurry! Hurry!

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:54.069
Quickly, in here.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:56.071
Do hide. Do hide.

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.673
No, no, no.

01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:17.759
No! Come on.

01:10:20.053 --> 01:10:21.054
Ben.

01:10:22.306 --> 01:10:23.682
Were you looking for me?

01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:24.683
No, no.

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:26.059
Wait.

01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:31.398
What?

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:39.114
No reason to be afraid.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.619
Now, I know this place
is absolutely dripping...

01:10:43.785 --> 01:10:45.787
with the most sorrowful souls...

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:49.041
all searching for what eluded them in life.

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:51.126
Searching for purpose...

01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:53.545
too cowardly to do anything about it.

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:57.674
But you, you have promise.

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:00.260
You know that life has no meaning.

01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:02.554
That we all end up in the dirt.

01:11:03.972 --> 01:11:04.806
Boo!

01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:10.854
If you're willing to help me,
I can give you what you want.

01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:12.439
No! No!

01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:25.619
The spirit realm is not welcoming me tonight.

01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:28.789
There's no use in running!

01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:33.377
Suffering is for the weak
and I know the way out.

01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:36.505
We have a deal to make.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.677
It's quite disappointing but...

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:45.305
But the real chill starts later.

01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:46.932
That's not Ben.

01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:01.363
You can get what you want...

01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:05.325
if you're willing.

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:09.413
Ben!

01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:13.041
It's me, it's me, it's me.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.418
I'm all right.

01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:17.629
I saw him.

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.799
This was not a regular ghost.

01:12:20.966 --> 01:12:22.885
Gracey was terrified.

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:24.469
I mean, they all were.

01:12:24.636 --> 01:12:26.805
Come on, a ghost who haunts other ghosts?

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:29.224
That's not fair.

01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:30.976
Aren't there any rules?

01:12:31.143 --> 01:12:32.436
Did he look human?

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:33.437
Sorta.

01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:35.147
He walked with a cane and a limp...

01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:38.942
and he carried his head inside of a hatbox.

01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:40.611
What part of that is "sorta"?

01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:46.033
Is there anything else that we can go on
to identify this "Hatbox Ghost"?

01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:51.914
I can give you what you want.

01:12:52.497 --> 01:12:54.082
The face in the box, it...

01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:56.919
He had this grin.

01:12:57.794 --> 01:13:00.547
This grin that's just burned into my memory.

01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:02.299
What was it like in there?

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:04.968
I mean, for a ghost realm,
there was just so much...

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.512
life.

01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:09.473
I mean, it wasn't even really hard
to reverse seance.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.100
No, I feel like I felt it
for a couple minutes...

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:13.685
like I was tripping.

01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:17.689
- Like a out-of-body experience. Electricity.
- It was a little bit of a shake, a tingle.

01:13:17.856 --> 01:13:20.442
I know, Harriet, that you can
do that thing...

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:22.903
but I think I was just feelin' so raw.

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.738
No, no, it's fine.

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:26.823
- I'm limited.
- No, you're not.

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:28.242
It is what it is.

01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:31.411
My family never believed
I had the gift either.

01:13:31.578 --> 01:13:33.121
Do you have any living family?

01:13:33.288 --> 01:13:36.542
Three sisters.
Bullied me every day of my life.

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:39.044
My older sister? She's just terrible.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:42.923
My middle sister, she's just an awful person.

01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:45.634
But my younger sister...

01:13:47.135 --> 01:13:49.096
I actually believe she is the Devil.

01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:51.181
Anyways...

01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:54.268
I know I can be challenging to be around.

01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:56.144
No, it's not that, Harriet.

01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:57.813
He wants me.

01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:04.945
I think he wants me to be his last soul.

01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:07.447
No. Ben, look at me.

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:08.824
You're not alone.

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:16.999
My wife died in a car accident.

01:14:18.959 --> 01:14:20.169
What was she like?

01:14:21.336 --> 01:14:22.838
She was the best.

01:14:23.922 --> 01:14:26.008
Yeah, she was just herself.

01:14:31.013 --> 01:14:31.930
And she liked to dance.

01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:34.474
<i>She couldn't dance, but she liked to.</i>

01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:37.853
<i>She also was the world's slowest runner.</i>

01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:40.522
<i>She'd say, "Let's go running"...</i>

01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.524
and she was eating a cheesesteak
while she said this.

01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:45.027
Talking about,
"I'm getting my carbo load."

01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:50.324
She was the type of person
that just included everyone.

01:14:50.991 --> 01:14:52.409
And I was...

01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:56.205
I was kinda the opposite.
People made me nervous.

01:14:56.371 --> 01:14:58.373
You have no social skills at all.

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:01.585
It's true.

01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:04.046
And there's...

01:15:05.881 --> 01:15:09.343
no way I could have gotten
to where I've gotten without her.

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:15.849
Then one day, she...

01:15:17.184 --> 01:15:19.937
She decided she was gonna go
get some tater tots.

01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:21.605
She liked tater tots.

01:15:22.356 --> 01:15:23.732
She asked me to go with her.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.739
And I just couldn't do it
because I was frustrated.

01:15:30.906 --> 01:15:34.034
I had so much work,
and so many things I still had to do.

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:35.244
So, I...

01:15:36.578 --> 01:15:37.788
So, I went off.

01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:41.542
And I said,
"Not right now, I'm doing something."

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.754
And then, she left.

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:49.132
Apparently, she stopped off
to get some ice cream...

01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:50.676
at a little Baskin Robbins.

01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:52.678
She got into an accident...

01:15:52.845 --> 01:15:54.638
and about 20 minutes later...

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.849
she was gone, and...

01:15:57.933 --> 01:16:01.395
So, that's why I put
all my time and energy...

01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:04.106
dedicated to finishing the camera.

01:16:05.482 --> 01:16:07.901
Because I just wanted
to see her one more time.

01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:13.448
She died alone.

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:19.037
And I feel like she didn't know
that I loved her.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.375
No, I'm sure that she knew.

01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:25.586
She definitely knew.

01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:26.587
My God.

01:16:26.753 --> 01:16:29.047
- What was the cholesterol on that woman?
- Bruce!

01:16:29.214 --> 01:16:30.299
Can you imagine?

01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.634
Cheesesteak, tater tots.

01:16:33.886 --> 01:16:35.095
She stopped off for ice cream.

01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:36.388
- Salt and fat.
- Oh, my God.

01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:37.890
- That's it.
- Bruce.

01:16:38.056 --> 01:16:39.683
She was going to the bone orchard!

01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:42.603
- Oh, my God!
- Thank you, Bruce.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:44.813
I needed that.

01:16:45.647 --> 01:16:48.609
Look, I don't know if any of us
are gonna make it out of this alive.

01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:51.653
It certainly seems like Ben's a goner,
but I'll tell you...

01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:54.907
I wouldn't wanna be going through this
with anyone else.

01:16:59.036 --> 01:16:59.995
Wait, wait, kid...

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.373
you said the image of his face...

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.417
was burned into your brain.

01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:06.710
Yeah.

01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:08.295
I have an idea.

01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:12.424
My friend was mugged...

01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.468
and he's going through the trauma
right now...

01:17:14.635 --> 01:17:16.637
but what we would like is a sketch artist...

01:17:16.803 --> 01:17:18.597
while it's still fresh in his mind.

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:21.808
He was tall.

01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:24.520
And kinda hunched over.

01:17:24.686 --> 01:17:26.021
Very thin.

01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:30.484
He had hair
that was sticking out of a top hat.

01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:33.153
- Top hat?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.571
- So, like, top hat?
- Top hat.

01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:37.241
Not a bowler or a cowboy hat.

01:17:37.407 --> 01:17:38.659
- Like a opera hat.
- Like a magician, yeah.

01:17:38.825 --> 01:17:41.578
- A magician hat!
- You would pull a rabbit out of it, probably.

01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:42.955
Eyes?

01:17:43.121 --> 01:17:44.998
Far apart, close, average?

01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:47.042
I think normal. Average.

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:48.669
Okay, average eyes.

01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:52.256
But they were a bit sunken
into the recesses of his ocular cavity.

01:17:52.422 --> 01:17:53.382
Deep eyes!

01:17:53.549 --> 01:17:55.300
- Deep sunken eyes.
- Like a raccoon.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.427
- Beady eyes!
- They were set back.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.222
His eyes were doing that.
And no eyelids.

01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:02.391
So, they're into his skull, no eyelids.

01:18:02.558 --> 01:18:04.017
- What about his nose?
- No nose.

01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.477
- He didn't have a...
- No nose!

01:18:05.644 --> 01:18:07.312
Why would he have a nose?

01:18:07.479 --> 01:18:10.858
- He was smiling.
- The man who mugged you was smiling?

01:18:11.024 --> 01:18:12.150
But he didn't have lips.

01:18:12.317 --> 01:18:15.863
- It was like a perpetual smile of sorts...
- Sure.

01:18:16.029 --> 01:18:17.447
It was kinda...
Yeah, like that.

01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:19.616
- This kind of thing.
- Exactly, yeah.

01:18:19.783 --> 01:18:21.869
No lips, why not?
Why would he have lips?

01:18:22.578 --> 01:18:23.996
Is this the man who mugged you?

01:18:24.705 --> 01:18:25.831
- Wow!
- Whoa!

01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:29.209
You just did that just now? This is amazing!

01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:30.377
You know what'd be fun?

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.379
See him with skin.

01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:36.508
The police station paid off!

01:18:36.675 --> 01:18:38.051
Alistair Crump.

01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:40.262
Very bad man. Very bad.

01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:45.017
Son of cutthroat real estate tycoon,
Addison Crump.

01:18:45.184 --> 01:18:49.479
<i>A cruel father who kicked Alistair out of
the house when he was just a boy...</i>

01:18:49.646 --> 01:18:53.901
<i>after claiming Alistair cried too much
at his mother's funeral.</i>

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:56.486
<i>Said he needed to make him a tougher man.</i>

01:18:58.030 --> 01:19:01.825
<i>His father's high society
turned its back on the boy.</i>

01:19:01.992 --> 01:19:07.456
<i>And with no friends and no other family,
Alistair disappeared.</i>

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.169
<i>Years later, following his
father's mysterious death...</i>

01:19:12.544 --> 01:19:15.589
<i>Alistair returned a wealthy tycoon...</i>

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:18.717
<i>who became famous for
throwing lavish parties...</i>

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:21.136
<i>with the very people who'd betrayed him.</i>

01:19:21.803 --> 01:19:25.182
<i>Only many of those guests
never made their way out!</i>

01:19:26.433 --> 01:19:31.522
<i>Whispers grew that Alistair was embroiled
in a form of dark magic...</i>

01:19:31.688 --> 01:19:36.527
<i>that required blood sacrifice
to maintain his wealth and power.</i>

01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:38.904
<i>No one ever found the bodies...</i>

01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:43.700
<i>but after years of abuse,
his staff finally rose up against him...</i>

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:45.244
<i>and beheaded Crump!</i>

01:19:46.495 --> 01:19:48.205
<i>Just before the axe fell...</i>

01:19:48.372 --> 01:19:53.085
<i>Alistair vowed revenge on all
from beyond the grave.</i>

01:19:53.252 --> 01:19:56.421
Crump, a murderer in life...

01:19:57.589 --> 01:20:01.134
Now, a murderer in death.

01:20:02.094 --> 01:20:06.265
Fortunately, for us, his old house
was deemed a historical property...

01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:07.933
up a few hours north.

01:20:08.225 --> 01:20:09.977
And turned into a bed and breakfast.

01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:14.356
So, we go there, get something of Crump's,
and we don't have to die.

01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:15.607
We got his address.

01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:16.608
Let me get my things.

01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:18.026
I can go 'cause I know how
to handle the item.

01:20:18.193 --> 01:20:19.069
Now I'll be back...

01:20:19.236 --> 01:20:20.070
Say it again! Say it again!

01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:21.572
- We're gonna get this guy.
- Yes!

01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:23.448
We're closing in, that's what we're doing.
We're closing in.

01:20:23.615 --> 01:20:24.950
Come on! What's up with the printer?

01:20:25.117 --> 01:20:27.119
Come on, it's gotta go.

01:20:27.828 --> 01:20:28.912
- It's going.
- It's on.

01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:30.247
Is anybody else seeing this?

01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:31.456
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:36.962
Leaving us already?

01:20:38.172 --> 01:20:39.548
Ben, here's the address!

01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:42.634
- If you make it out, get to Crump Manor!
- Oh, no!

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.554
I do love surprises.

01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:48.682
And I've got a great one coming up for you.

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:50.434
Now, Travis...

01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:53.979
Quicksand!

01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:55.480
Travis!

01:20:57.858 --> 01:20:59.193
Oh, my God. Dynamite!

01:20:59.568 --> 01:21:01.653
We're trapped, look for a way out!

01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:07.743
We gotta go, we gotta go now.

01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:11.747
Get to the gargoyles, fast.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.957
Travis, you gotta grab one of the gargoyles!

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:15.501
That's how we get out of here.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.671
That's great, now hold on.

01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:21.298
Okay, okay, okay!

01:21:23.342 --> 01:21:25.135
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh!

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:26.261
Don't look down.

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:28.764
Ben!

01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:30.474
Not today, Satan.

01:21:31.225 --> 01:21:33.143
You better get back, I rebuke you!

01:21:33.644 --> 01:21:35.145
Not today!

01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:39.274
Bruce!

01:21:42.486 --> 01:21:44.238
Those teeth look really sharp, Ben.

01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:48.742
Hey, painting lady, what do we do now?

01:21:48.909 --> 01:21:50.953
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:52.788
Come on, hurry!

01:21:52.955 --> 01:21:55.457
You might want to give that ceiling
a second look.

01:21:55.832 --> 01:21:58.418
Or you could end up like my husband.

01:21:58.585 --> 01:21:59.670
Get us out of here!

01:21:59.837 --> 01:22:00.963
One second, Travis!

01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:03.173
Okay, it's getting closer!

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:04.842
You see that?

01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:06.760
Climb up and you can get out!

01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:08.136
Okay, okay.

01:22:08.846 --> 01:22:09.680
Hurry!

01:22:09.847 --> 01:22:11.390
I can't get a grip.

01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:13.058
Come on, Ben.

01:22:13.225 --> 01:22:14.893
Okay. Okay. I'm trying.

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.316
Yes! Oh, finally.

01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:28.156
Look, look, it's Kent!

01:22:28.323 --> 01:22:29.241
Kent! Hey!

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.036
I go to my car for five minutes
and then can't get back in the house.

01:22:33.203 --> 01:22:34.079
What happened?

01:22:34.246 --> 01:22:36.331
That's 'cause Crump is trying
to keep us here.

01:22:36.707 --> 01:22:37.708
Bruce!

01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:39.585
Bruce, get up!

01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:41.920
Whoa. Whoa. Okay, okay.

01:22:42.588 --> 01:22:43.589
This is all right.

01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:44.756
Let's see. No.

01:22:49.178 --> 01:22:50.179
Calm down.

01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:55.517
- No. Crump.
- Keep your head back.

01:22:55.684 --> 01:22:57.644
I'll drive. Don't worry.
We don't have time.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:59.146
I'd love to explain to you,
but we don't have time!

01:22:59.313 --> 01:23:00.314
Come on, come on.

01:23:02.566 --> 01:23:03.483
Come on, get inside.

01:23:08.071 --> 01:23:08.697
- Watch out!
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:23:08.864 --> 01:23:11.241
I'm too young to die! Just keep driving!

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:12.451
It's much harder than it looks!

01:23:13.076 --> 01:23:14.077
Drive! Okay.

01:23:14.244 --> 01:23:15.204
- Watch... Oh, my God!
- I got it, I got it.

01:23:16.622 --> 01:23:17.414
I don't want to die!

01:23:17.581 --> 01:23:19.458
- Just keep driving!
- Okay, okay.

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:21.168
Put the pedal to the metal!

01:23:21.335 --> 01:23:24.213
- I'm going as fast as I can go.
- The trees are attacking us!

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.382
- Oh, my God!
- Much harder than it looks. Okay.

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:31.512
There we go, there we go.

01:23:35.516 --> 01:23:36.517
- Oh, my God!
- Okay.

01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:38.143
- Watch where you're going.
- Okay!

01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.270
- Wow.
- What's going on? What's happening?

01:23:41.813 --> 01:23:43.649
We found him. He is not happy.

01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:45.234
And what about those guys?

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.070
Well, maybe they'll help us
like the ones in the painting.

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:53.992
Bruce, stay with me.

01:24:03.544 --> 01:24:06.421
Not only is this a lovely bed and breakfast,
but the owners...

01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:08.549
Pat and Vic, do dinner theater as well.

01:24:08.715 --> 01:24:09.716
Oh, God.

01:24:17.933 --> 01:24:20.102
Okay, Mr. Ghost?

01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:21.144
Hi.

01:24:22.062 --> 01:24:24.982
Do you mind waiting in the car
while we go get your mansion back...

01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:27.943
so that you may not haunt us for eternity?

01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:32.406
Thank you.

01:24:33.365 --> 01:24:34.366
Thank you.

01:24:36.243 --> 01:24:38.036
There's a tour starting in five minutes.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.663
Perfect timing.

01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:42.082
Okay, we're getting one item,
then we leave. Got it?

01:24:42.249 --> 01:24:43.458
In and out, real quick.

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.461
This tour will take approximately
three hours.

01:24:46.628 --> 01:24:48.672
Bathroom breaks are strictly prohibited.

01:24:49.173 --> 01:24:53.177
Sir Alistair Crump wanted the grandest house
in all of the Valley.

01:24:53.385 --> 01:24:56.847
You'll note there's no seating
in the foyer...

01:24:57.014 --> 01:25:00.475
as he would have no man or woman seated...

01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:01.768
when he entered a room.

01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:03.020
That cane...

01:25:03.187 --> 01:25:05.439
Did that belong to Alistair Crump, by chance?

01:25:05.772 --> 01:25:07.816
No, that is my cane.

01:25:07.983 --> 01:25:11.737
I use it for deeply personal reasons.

01:25:12.487 --> 01:25:14.781
Does anything in this room
belong to Alistair Crump?

01:25:15.449 --> 01:25:16.825
Uh, no.

01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:19.286
Well, I don't know why we're here.

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:25.209
And here, if you'll notice,
this chair at the end of the table...

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:28.003
is noticeably higher than the other chairs.

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.880
He had the legs shortened...

01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:32.090
and he added pillows to his seat...

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.510
as to remain above everyone else.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.387
I mean, this guy was so petty,
you almost got to respect it.

01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:39.515
So, are those his actual pillows?

01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:40.682
No.

01:25:42.434 --> 01:25:46.104
Here is a portrait
of Mr. Crump's third wife, Margaret.

01:25:46.772 --> 01:25:50.609
Margaret was still just his mistress
at the time of this painting.

01:25:50.776 --> 01:25:55.072
And it was through the painting
that his second wife learned of the affair...

01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:58.242
when he hung it here for her to see.

01:25:58.408 --> 01:25:59.326
That's one way to do it.

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:00.953
Well...

01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:02.996
"I do not trust any man who reads...

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:06.875
"nor any woman who, dot, dot, dot, reads."

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.836
Was it just hard to find quotes or...

01:26:09.002 --> 01:26:12.756
This comb here, did that belong to Crump?

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:15.217
No, that is a replica.

01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:17.177
Then why is it in a glass box?

01:26:17.344 --> 01:26:19.513
Would you like to be the tour guide?

01:26:20.973 --> 01:26:21.974
No.

01:26:23.517 --> 01:26:24.351
No.

01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:25.686
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:26:25.853 --> 01:26:28.188
I'm going to have to shut everything down.

01:26:28.355 --> 01:26:29.481
There's been...

01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.483
a murder.

01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:34.778
Alistair Crump has been decapitated.

01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:36.363
Was it the butler?

01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:37.531
No.

01:26:37.698 --> 01:26:40.409
The ingenue from out of town?

01:26:40.576 --> 01:26:41.451
She was with me.

01:26:42.244 --> 01:26:44.538
I'm Vic, your other tour guide.

01:26:44.705 --> 01:26:46.665
And stage and screen veteran.

01:26:47.124 --> 01:26:51.295
There are many more stories like this one,
if you'll follow me into the salon.

01:26:51.753 --> 01:26:53.088
Pat and Vic, they're the best!

01:26:53.964 --> 01:26:55.007
A murder.

01:26:55.674 --> 01:26:58.594
- I bet that head is in our room.
- It wasn't the last time.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.012
Wait. What did you say?

01:27:00.554 --> 01:27:03.640
Apparently, they found Crump's body,
but not the head.

01:27:03.807 --> 01:27:05.726
And the suspect walked out empty-handed.

01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:07.269
So, people think...

01:27:08.812 --> 01:27:10.898
the head is still here.

01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:15.110
Thanks, friend.

01:27:18.614 --> 01:27:19.907
- Looks like...
- We gotta find that head.

01:27:20.073 --> 01:27:20.908
Yeah.

01:27:21.074 --> 01:27:22.993
How are we gonna find it
if they haven't found it in 150 years?

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.411
There's another way.

01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:28.248
We're not alone.

01:27:30.876 --> 01:27:33.045
All right. Okay.

01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:35.756
<i>We'll strike out hard.</i>

01:27:36.965 --> 01:27:39.510
<i>A rocky patch of... grounds,
known to provide shelter...</i>

01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:41.136
Hello.

01:27:41.303 --> 01:27:43.388
I'm realizing I don't know what your name is.

01:27:43.555 --> 01:27:45.516
Ben, conversational.

01:27:46.099 --> 01:27:47.059
Captain?

01:27:50.646 --> 01:27:51.647
How about this?

01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.982
What do you need?

01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.319
Maybe you help us, and we'll help you.

01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:02.407
Okay, that's good.

01:28:02.574 --> 01:28:04.409
He's open, he's open.

01:28:08.205 --> 01:28:09.206
Okay.

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:12.251
All right.

01:28:12.793 --> 01:28:16.338
Write your message in the mirror,
whatever you want us to do.

01:28:24.763 --> 01:28:26.640
- The sea! The sea! Yes!
- Done.

01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:29.101
- The sea. We can do that. That's very doable.
- Yeah, that's, we can.

01:28:29.268 --> 01:28:31.395
You help us, we'll take you to the sea.

01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:32.729
Here.

01:28:32.896 --> 01:28:35.399
Okay, what can you tell us about Crump?

01:28:37.526 --> 01:28:38.527
Okay.

01:29:01.967 --> 01:29:05.429
Can you believe I've barely had lessons?

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:08.599
No, no.
No singing along, please.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.659
Oh, great. A dead end.

01:29:28.702 --> 01:29:29.786
Wait a minute.

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.126
I can't fit in there.

01:29:36.293 --> 01:29:37.753
Yeah, me neither.

01:29:42.966 --> 01:29:43.842
No.

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:45.469
You want me to go down there?

01:29:45.636 --> 01:29:47.179
Are you kidding me? I'm a child!

01:29:47.346 --> 01:29:48.847
Yes, this is true...

01:29:49.014 --> 01:29:51.266
and you don't have to go down there.

01:29:51.767 --> 01:29:52.684
However...

01:29:53.268 --> 01:29:55.270
- you gotta go down there.
- You gotta go.

01:30:05.489 --> 01:30:08.450
- You all right? You good?
- No! This is a tunnel of terrors!

01:30:08.617 --> 01:30:09.451
Oh, no!

01:30:26.468 --> 01:30:27.761
Oh, my gosh.

01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:30.764
This is where he hid all the bodies.

01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:54.454
- Travis?
- Travis, are you okay?

01:30:54.955 --> 01:30:56.874
Travis, are you all right? You good?

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.584
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:31:06.008 --> 01:31:08.010
Well, I hope everyone's okay
back at the house.

01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:10.262
Look.

01:31:12.431 --> 01:31:13.432
What is it?

01:31:13.599 --> 01:31:14.892
Tater tots.

01:31:15.058 --> 01:31:16.727
- It's a ghost wink.
- Let me see.

01:31:17.311 --> 01:31:18.312
No.

01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:20.939
Those are my jalapeño poppers.

01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:23.108
Look a lot like tots to me.

01:31:23.483 --> 01:31:24.526
Oh, my God.

01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:37.372
Did we make it in time?

01:31:37.539 --> 01:31:38.665
Everything looks normal.

01:31:38.832 --> 01:31:41.960
Of course, normal for this place
is terrifying.

01:31:43.003 --> 01:31:46.298
Yeah, listen,
if we're not back in two hours...

01:31:46.465 --> 01:31:48.258
and I never thought I'd say this...

01:31:48.425 --> 01:31:49.426
call the police.

01:31:50.511 --> 01:31:51.345
Wait.

01:31:51.762 --> 01:31:52.888
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

01:31:53.055 --> 01:31:55.766
Travis, you gotta stay
in the car for me, okay?

01:31:55.933 --> 01:31:58.727
But I did so good! I got us the top hat.

01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:00.312
Just let me be a part of this.

01:32:01.063 --> 01:32:03.732
Listen, Travis, it's just too dangerous.

01:32:07.027 --> 01:32:10.113
- Fine. I'll try my dad.
- Okay.

01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:14.493
Stay here, okay?
Give me.

01:32:24.878 --> 01:32:26.129
Let's do this, baby.

01:32:27.923 --> 01:32:29.591
Kent, come on, man. What are you...

01:32:30.008 --> 01:32:33.595
If this comes down to an exorcism,
we're in big trouble.

01:32:34.388 --> 01:32:36.515
- Why...
- Because I don't know what I'm doing.

01:32:36.682 --> 01:32:38.308
I'm not even a priest!

01:32:38.475 --> 01:32:39.977
I work in Halloween supplies.

01:32:40.143 --> 01:32:42.563
I just put this on
just to make some extra scratch.

01:32:42.729 --> 01:32:44.648
Yeah, everyone wants to think
their house is haunted...

01:32:44.815 --> 01:32:47.776
so I go sprinkle some holy water
and get paid.

01:32:47.943 --> 01:32:49.069
I'm a fraud.

01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:51.196
I'm sorry.

01:32:52.948 --> 01:32:53.866
You...

01:32:57.703 --> 01:33:00.414
Listen, I don't know what you are,
and I don't even really care.

01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:01.915
All I know is that you helped...

01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:03.250
You helped me!

01:33:03.417 --> 01:33:08.005
Yeah, you helped me see in myself
that I had something that was useful.

01:33:08.172 --> 01:33:09.131
You taught me that.

01:33:09.298 --> 01:33:11.466
And whatever is in that house,
whatever it is that we gotta face...

01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:13.552
we can't face it without you, all right?

01:33:13.719 --> 01:33:15.804
- No.
- Father Kent.

01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:17.472
Now, let me ask you something.

01:33:18.932 --> 01:33:20.100
You wanna be a hero?

01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:24.104
- No.
- See?

01:33:24.855 --> 01:33:27.357
You can't use my lines back against me.

01:33:28.066 --> 01:33:29.985
So, let's go! Let's do this!

01:33:30.652 --> 01:33:32.362
- Come on, baby.
- I'm gonna need a drink.

01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:37.701
It's almost midnight.

01:33:37.868 --> 01:33:40.329
Yeah, we need Harriet
to do this banishment spell now.

01:33:43.624 --> 01:33:44.833
Harriet?

01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:53.467
I'm afraid of...

01:33:55.135 --> 01:33:57.179
Bruce, you gotta stop doing that.

01:33:57.346 --> 01:33:58.263
Where is everybody?

01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:00.974
The house is clear. It's over.

01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:05.979
Harriet found some mumbo jumbo in that book.

01:34:07.064 --> 01:34:09.066
Things got quite hairy...

01:34:09.233 --> 01:34:12.194
but the shared struggle was necessary...

01:34:12.361 --> 01:34:14.029
for character growth.

01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:16.073
Okay, so where's Harriet and Gabbie?

01:34:19.618 --> 01:34:21.328
General store.

01:34:22.037 --> 01:34:23.038
Taffy.

01:34:23.622 --> 01:34:24.998
- They went to get taffy?
- Yes!

01:34:25.165 --> 01:34:27.417
They went shopping!
Drink up!

01:34:27.584 --> 01:34:30.045
Actually, I'm good. Thank you.

01:34:30.212 --> 01:34:31.755
I'm gonna go find them.

01:34:35.884 --> 01:34:37.052
And then there were two.

01:34:37.553 --> 01:34:39.346
It's happy hour somewhere, right?

01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:40.681
"Happy hour."

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:43.392
What a turn of phrase.

01:34:45.269 --> 01:34:46.353
Happy hour!

01:34:57.489 --> 01:34:58.490
Dad...

01:34:59.658 --> 01:35:00.868
I'm scared.

01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:07.291
<i>Is that the hat?</i>

01:35:07.457 --> 01:35:09.668
No, actually, it's just the replica.

01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:11.378
Can I see it?

01:35:15.299 --> 01:35:16.967
Bruce, are you okay?

01:35:17.134 --> 01:35:18.135
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:20.554
You're gonna give me the hat.

01:35:21.096 --> 01:35:23.599
You're gonna walk out of this house...

01:35:23.932 --> 01:35:25.642
and never come back.

01:35:28.312 --> 01:35:30.063
- I got you. I got you.
- Where's Travis?

01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.732
- Give me the hat!
- Bruce, no!

01:35:31.899 --> 01:35:33.358
Give me that. Give it!

01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:35.027
- Give it!
- No! No!

01:35:39.406 --> 01:35:40.365
The Good Book!

01:35:46.163 --> 01:35:48.207
I'm gonna get you, Harriet.
And Gabbie, I'll untie you in a second.

01:35:48.373 --> 01:35:49.208
Travis!

01:35:49.791 --> 01:35:51.126
Dang, girl, you fast.

01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:24.326
- It's a full moon. Crump has all his powers!
- Harriet, start the banishment.

01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:25.953
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You got this.

01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:29.414
When hinges creak in doorless chambers...

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.083
and strange and...

01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:35.671
Thank you for your assistance, Professor.

01:36:38.465 --> 01:36:39.466
Bruce!

01:36:45.556 --> 01:36:48.183
This wretched place is stifling me.

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:50.519
I think it's time for me to go.

01:36:50.686 --> 01:36:51.770
I'm going to get the hat.

01:36:53.188 --> 01:36:54.147
Scratch the hat.

01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:58.819
There are 999 souls that reside here!

01:36:58.986 --> 01:37:00.779
But there's always room...

01:37:01.655 --> 01:37:02.823
for one more.

01:37:03.615 --> 01:37:04.658
And to think...

01:37:05.158 --> 01:37:08.036
it could have been you, Ben.

01:37:10.497 --> 01:37:12.583
Travis? Where's Travis?

01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:16.461
Travis is okay, all right?
He's at the car, he's talking to his dad.

01:37:16.628 --> 01:37:18.046
What? That's not possible!

01:37:18.213 --> 01:37:20.465
Gabbie, he still talks to his father.

01:37:20.632 --> 01:37:22.009
His father is dead, Ben.

01:37:22.843 --> 01:37:24.219
Just over a year ago.

01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:28.974
Surprise!

01:37:30.809 --> 01:37:31.935
I wanna see you, too.

01:37:32.102 --> 01:37:33.687
But, how?

01:37:36.523 --> 01:37:39.359
I have my willing soul.

01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:40.569
Oh, my God!

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.489
I hate to be a terrible host and run...

01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:47.618
but I have a reunion to get to.

01:37:47.784 --> 01:37:49.870
Don't worry, you won't be alone.

01:37:50.037 --> 01:37:52.206
Oh, good.
And now he's conjuring up a ghost army.

01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:56.251
Let my friends show you around.

01:37:57.503 --> 01:37:58.462
Toodle-oo.

01:38:01.882 --> 01:38:02.925
Travis...

01:38:04.301 --> 01:38:06.803
Okay, all we have to do is get to that hat.

01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:08.722
Okay, Harriet, you're gonna
go see Madame Leota.

01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.015
Maybe she'll know what to do.

01:38:10.182 --> 01:38:12.518
- Gabbie, you and me will go find Travis.
- Yes.

01:38:12.809 --> 01:38:14.770
Bruce, you're gonna stay right here, okay?

01:38:14.937 --> 01:38:18.106
You're gonna go grab the hat
as soon as these ghosts leave, okay?

01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:19.566
Why would the ghosts leave?

01:38:19.733 --> 01:38:22.361
Because you have the most important job
of them all, Kent.

01:38:22.528 --> 01:38:23.570
You're the diversion.

01:38:23.737 --> 01:38:24.947
We're running out of time!

01:38:25.405 --> 01:38:26.823
- Come on. Go.
- Come on.

01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.908
Kent...

01:38:28.075 --> 01:38:29.409
I have faith in you.

01:38:32.621 --> 01:38:33.997
Leota!

01:38:40.045 --> 01:38:41.004
Travis!

01:38:41.171 --> 01:38:43.173
He's trying to keep Travis away from us!

01:38:51.723 --> 01:38:52.683
Travis.

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:54.476
Dad?

01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:04.736
- Gabbie! Gabbie!
- Ben!

01:39:08.115 --> 01:39:09.116
Time to divert.

01:39:09.533 --> 01:39:10.826
You wanna step to me?

01:39:10.993 --> 01:39:12.536
'Cause I got an exorcism for you.

01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:14.079
Starting now.

01:39:14.538 --> 01:39:16.456
The wicked shall be driven from this house.

01:39:16.832 --> 01:39:19.334
Madame Leota? Madame Leota.

01:39:20.043 --> 01:39:21.336
We need your help.

01:39:21.503 --> 01:39:24.673
I tried to banish him,
but he's just way too strong.

01:39:25.048 --> 01:39:28.260
The only chance we have
to defeat him...

01:39:28.677 --> 01:39:30.929
is combining our might.

01:39:31.555 --> 01:39:33.765
You must release me.

01:39:33.932 --> 01:39:35.726
The power of Kent compels you!

01:39:35.726 --> 01:39:37.686
<i>Ipso facto. Carpe Diem.</i>

01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:39.104
Go, now!

01:39:40.939 --> 01:39:42.191
Just like I thought.

01:39:42.608 --> 01:39:44.902
Exorcism went right over your head.
You know why?

01:39:45.068 --> 01:39:47.946
'Cause you're too stupid to understand Latin!

01:39:50.532 --> 01:39:51.658
Keep going, it's working.

01:39:51.825 --> 01:39:53.202
Bunch of ignorant ghosts.

01:39:54.369 --> 01:39:56.205
That's right, I said it. Morons.

01:39:58.624 --> 01:39:59.917
I'm gonna die.

01:40:02.878 --> 01:40:04.463
Gracey, I need your help!

01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:06.215
You need to help me find Travis.

01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:08.842
Hey, Gracey.

01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:11.178
Hey, you gotta help me!

01:40:11.345 --> 01:40:12.346
This way.

01:40:12.513 --> 01:40:15.140
With the realms blending,
we can find a faster route.

01:40:17.434 --> 01:40:20.395
There is a spell in my book.

01:40:20.562 --> 01:40:25.984
But it can only be recited by someone
with a profound gift.

01:40:27.611 --> 01:40:31.949
You may not believe in yourself
but I believe in you.

01:40:32.407 --> 01:40:36.870
Set me free
and I will help you banish him.

01:40:41.124 --> 01:40:43.502
Travis? Is that you?

01:40:44.545 --> 01:40:45.921
Dad, I'm here.

01:40:52.302 --> 01:40:53.804
No. No. No.

01:40:54.555 --> 01:40:55.806
Bruce, hurry!

01:40:56.765 --> 01:40:58.517
I can't buy you much more time!

01:41:00.185 --> 01:41:01.603
Oh, no! No!

01:41:04.731 --> 01:41:06.066
I'll go find the others.

01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:08.819
Ben, good luck.

01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:10.612
Thank you, Gracey.

01:41:14.199 --> 01:41:15.117
Travis!

01:41:20.205 --> 01:41:22.249
Travis, Travis, I need you
to give me your hand!

01:41:22.708 --> 01:41:24.251
I'm going to see my dad.

01:41:24.543 --> 01:41:26.086
Look, I made a mistake, okay?

01:41:26.253 --> 01:41:27.796
I was wrong. Your dad's not here.

01:41:27.963 --> 01:41:30.132
I'm so sorry about that,
but we don't have time, okay?

01:41:30.299 --> 01:41:31.258
Come on, give me your hand.

01:41:31.425 --> 01:41:33.552
No, but I can hear him.

01:41:33.719 --> 01:41:36.180
Travis, who is that man?

01:41:36.346 --> 01:41:38.974
Hey, listen, think about it.
Think about it.

01:41:39.141 --> 01:41:42.186
Your dad would want you to be safe and sound
with your mom.

01:41:42.352 --> 01:41:45.480
- Now, I need you to trust me.
- No, I hate it here!

01:41:45.647 --> 01:41:46.732
I know, but you and your mom...

01:41:46.899 --> 01:41:48.400
are gonna be somewhere
completely different than this.

01:41:48.567 --> 01:41:50.027
I hate it everywhere!

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.530
Nowhere feels right without him.

01:41:56.575 --> 01:41:57.784
Listen, Travis...

01:41:57.951 --> 01:42:00.287
I know the pain you feel. I feel it, too.

01:42:01.079 --> 01:42:03.207
But I need you to trust me right now,
all right?

01:42:03.373 --> 01:42:05.709
You come here,
you tell me all about your misery.

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.128
We'll be miserable together
until there's nothing left.

01:42:08.295 --> 01:42:09.922
Travis, don't you miss me?

01:42:10.088 --> 01:42:11.548
Your dad, he loves you, okay?

01:42:11.715 --> 01:42:14.384
Now, he wants to see
and feel you thrive and live!

01:42:14.551 --> 01:42:15.552
Come on, Travis.

01:42:15.719 --> 01:42:16.762
So, come on.

01:42:16.929 --> 01:42:17.763
Come on!

01:42:18.138 --> 01:42:20.349
Travis, don't believe him.
He's not your father.

01:42:20.516 --> 01:42:22.935
Don't let him get in your head.
Come on, you can do it.

01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:25.229
We can be together again! Don't do this!

01:42:25.395 --> 01:42:28.357
He feeds on your grief.
You gotta let it go, Travis.

01:42:28.524 --> 01:42:30.317
You gotta let it go, okay?

01:42:30.901 --> 01:42:32.736
Okay, all right, you got it, you got it.

01:42:32.903 --> 01:42:33.946
You got it.

01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:35.948
Don't. Don't leave me, please.

01:42:36.365 --> 01:42:37.991
Come on. All right. Okay.

01:42:38.158 --> 01:42:39.743
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:41.119
I got you. I got you.

01:42:41.703 --> 01:42:43.288
You're good. You did good. Okay?

01:42:43.455 --> 01:42:44.289
Okay.

01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:47.960
That's not good.

01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:52.798
Come on, Travis.
We got this.

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.384
Good luck! Down there is a way out.

01:42:55.551 --> 01:42:56.552
Travis!

01:42:57.010 --> 01:42:58.011
Oh, thank God!

01:42:58.178 --> 01:42:59.179
- Come on!
- We gotta go!

01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:01.890
- Mom!
- Go, go, go!

01:43:02.057 --> 01:43:03.517
Go! Run!

01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:26.164
I told you...

01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:28.792
all roads lead to me.

01:43:29.459 --> 01:43:32.880
And let me make myself clear.

01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:38.343
Either I haunt this boy and his mummy
for all eternity...

01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.763
or you and I make a deal.

01:43:42.598 --> 01:43:44.600
All you have to be...

01:43:45.726 --> 01:43:46.768
is willing.

01:43:47.811 --> 01:43:49.062
- No, no. No.
- Ben.

01:43:49.646 --> 01:43:52.816
- Don't listen to him.
- I won't let him hurt Travis or you.

01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.068
Don't do this, Ben, please.

01:43:57.946 --> 01:43:59.448
- Don't do it!
- Ben, no!

01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:13.670
Enough. That's it.

01:44:15.464 --> 01:44:16.590
And look at yourselves.

01:44:17.174 --> 01:44:19.384
Is this really how you want
to spend eternity?

01:44:19.927 --> 01:44:20.969
Chasing people?

01:44:21.637 --> 01:44:24.389
Well, you know what?
You're not that scary, you're really not.

01:44:24.556 --> 01:44:26.725
And... Well, you're pretty terrifying.

01:44:27.309 --> 01:44:29.520
Can you turn around,
just while I finish this rant?

01:44:30.312 --> 01:44:31.313
Thank you.

01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:38.362
Excellent choice, Ben.

01:44:38.779 --> 01:44:42.282
They could never help
what's broken inside of you.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.576
<i>Crump is using you.</i>

01:44:44.743 --> 01:44:47.287
He's using you to do his own dirty work,
and for what?

01:44:47.621 --> 01:44:50.165
To remain trapped in this house forever?

01:44:50.791 --> 01:44:52.835
And believe me,
I know a con when I see one.

01:44:53.377 --> 01:44:55.629
In fact, this was all a con.

01:44:55.796 --> 01:44:58.173
Yeah, this whole chase was just a diversion.

01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.009
<i>While you were distracted,
we've been getting the hat.</i>

01:45:01.176 --> 01:45:03.846
<i>So maybe today is the day you risk it all...</i>

01:45:04.012 --> 01:45:05.264
<i>and join the winning team.</i>

01:45:06.139 --> 01:45:09.560
The day you finally rise up as one...

01:45:09.726 --> 01:45:13.063
and ask yourself, are you ready to be a hero?

01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:18.360
Oh, my God.

01:45:20.487 --> 01:45:21.530
I have your word...

01:45:21.697 --> 01:45:24.032
you're gonna leave them alone
and you're never gonna haunt them again?

01:45:24.199 --> 01:45:27.286
Your soul is the last I'll ever need.

01:45:29.079 --> 01:45:30.289
You know what to do.

01:45:30.455 --> 01:45:32.416
You can save them.

01:45:34.209 --> 01:45:36.587
Ben! You have friends here!

01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:40.841
From the moment you stepped foot
into this house...

01:45:41.175 --> 01:45:43.886
<i>I could almost taste your grief.</i>

01:45:44.094 --> 01:45:46.305
I know what you've been longing for.

01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:47.472
Don't listen to him.

01:45:47.973 --> 01:45:48.974
Say it!

01:45:50.434 --> 01:45:51.602
I'm willing!

01:45:51.768 --> 01:45:53.312
Take my hand...

01:45:53.478 --> 01:45:56.773
and you will be with your beloved Alyssa.

01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.567
Because in this realm...

01:45:58.734 --> 01:46:00.777
you have no one.

01:46:04.823 --> 01:46:05.908
Harriet?

01:46:06.074 --> 01:46:07.451
It's too late.

01:46:08.869 --> 01:46:11.163
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Crump.

01:46:14.499 --> 01:46:16.543
You imprisoned me.

01:46:16.710 --> 01:46:19.004
Now it's time to return the favor.

01:46:19.630 --> 01:46:20.631
I set her free.

01:46:20.797 --> 01:46:22.007
I did that.

01:46:22.382 --> 01:46:23.509
Pathetic.

01:46:23.675 --> 01:46:24.968
See to them.

01:46:30.474 --> 01:46:32.100
They'll have to come through me first.

01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:34.853
And by "me," she means "we"!

01:46:37.773 --> 01:46:40.567
You've all betrayed me for the last time.

01:46:41.026 --> 01:46:42.361
You'll regret that.

01:46:44.863 --> 01:46:46.031
I got the hat!

01:46:46.198 --> 01:46:46.990
Bruce!

01:46:48.158 --> 01:46:49.326
Stop him!

01:46:49.493 --> 01:46:53.038
- Bring it to us. We must banish him now!
- Yeah.

01:46:53.205 --> 01:46:55.040
I'm done with you, old man.

01:46:55.207 --> 01:46:56.208
Destroy them!

01:46:56.375 --> 01:46:57.626
- Bruce!
- Bruce!

01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:04.633
We still need a piece of the item.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.801
I got it. I can help.

01:47:05.968 --> 01:47:07.678
No, no, no, Travis!

01:47:08.428 --> 01:47:09.429
Get...

01:47:10.889 --> 01:47:11.890
I'm coming, Bruce!

01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:12.933
Help Travis!

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.059
- Over here!
- This way!

01:47:14.977 --> 01:47:16.103
- I'm coming!
- Enough.

01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:17.896
I'll have to do this myself.

01:47:19.398 --> 01:47:21.316
Wait, wait! You're right.

01:47:21.567 --> 01:47:24.862
You're absolutely right.
About me, about my grief.

01:47:27.573 --> 01:47:28.448
Take the hat.

01:47:29.324 --> 01:47:30.325
These people...

01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:32.286
You cannot escape.

01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:34.913
They can't save me from my grief.

01:47:37.124 --> 01:47:38.000
I'm coming!

01:47:40.961 --> 01:47:43.213
- Got it!
- Harriet, you have the power.

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.882
Finish him!

01:47:49.219 --> 01:47:50.679
But they can save me from you.

01:47:50.846 --> 01:47:53.640
When hinges creak in doorless chambers...

01:47:55.809 --> 01:47:58.770
where the air is deathly still...

01:47:59.688 --> 01:48:01.899
these souls will not be displaced.

01:48:03.942 --> 01:48:06.820
Return them to their final resting place!

01:48:07.362 --> 01:48:08.780
Ben. No.

01:48:09.323 --> 01:48:10.782
Yes! Say it again!

01:48:10.949 --> 01:48:12.284
Return!

01:48:13.785 --> 01:48:17.831
I will torment your friends for all eternity.

01:48:17.998 --> 01:48:19.082
Say it again!

01:48:19.249 --> 01:48:20.918
Return!

01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:24.296
Return!

01:48:28.258 --> 01:48:29.218
Ben!

01:48:29.384 --> 01:48:31.553
Come with me to see your wife.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.224
This is your last chance to tell Alyssa
that you love her.

01:48:51.490 --> 01:48:52.699
She knows.

01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.410
Ben.

01:48:55.577 --> 01:48:56.828
No.

01:48:56.995 --> 01:48:58.080
No!

01:49:08.257 --> 01:49:09.258
Yes!

01:49:09.424 --> 01:49:12.970
We did it! Come on.
Come here, you scary son of a gun.

01:49:23.355 --> 01:49:25.107
I think you got your house back now.

01:49:35.576 --> 01:49:36.577
Ben!

01:49:38.704 --> 01:49:40.497
- You're okay!
- Wow, you did so good.

01:49:41.665 --> 01:49:42.749
Wow.

01:49:42.916 --> 01:49:44.042
Thank you.

01:49:48.297 --> 01:49:50.007
- Get in here.
- You were so brave. So proud of you.

01:49:50.174 --> 01:49:53.051
- Ben, just like in the history books.
- We couldn't do it without you.

01:49:55.721 --> 01:49:57.055
And now you're free!

01:49:57.222 --> 01:49:59.224
Free to return to the ghost realm.

01:49:59.516 --> 01:50:00.517
Go on!

01:50:01.393 --> 01:50:02.728
Disperse!

01:50:04.771 --> 01:50:06.857
Okay, look,
we gotta talk about boundaries.

01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:12.738
I sense that many of these ghosts
don't want to move on.

01:50:13.822 --> 01:50:14.823
What about you?

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.159
The spell will fade soon.

01:50:17.326 --> 01:50:19.286
I will return to my crystal ball.

01:50:20.162 --> 01:50:22.789
No, it's actually quite spacious inside.

01:50:25.042 --> 01:50:26.919
This house is where I belong.

01:50:46.772 --> 01:50:49.942
Yeah, these ghosts definitely
don't wanna leave this house.

01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:54.279
- They can have it.
- Well, you know...

01:50:54.446 --> 01:50:57.074
somebody's gonna have to
watch after them, right?

01:50:58.909 --> 01:50:59.910
Boom.

01:51:13.298 --> 01:51:14.675
It's all right.

01:51:14.842 --> 01:51:16.009
Go on, go on, don't be scared.

01:51:16.176 --> 01:51:17.010
Go ahead.

01:51:42.327 --> 01:51:43.954
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:51:44.872 --> 01:51:47.249
Make sure you take care of her things, okay?

01:51:47.416 --> 01:51:52.379
Well, it's gonna make some lucky lady
at my parish very happy.

01:51:52.546 --> 01:51:54.047
You don't have a parish.

01:51:54.214 --> 01:51:55.674
I still like to give.

01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:57.551
You okay?

01:51:59.261 --> 01:52:00.345
I'm okay.

01:52:01.305 --> 01:52:03.098
Well, bop 'til you drop.

01:52:04.683 --> 01:52:06.101
See you tonight.

01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:08.562
Hey.

01:52:10.063 --> 01:52:11.231
Hey, there.

01:52:13.108 --> 01:52:14.109
How you doing?

01:52:17.946 --> 01:52:18.947
So pretty.

01:52:21.366 --> 01:52:22.576
What's this you got here?

01:52:23.827 --> 01:52:24.870
What's your name?

01:52:58.612 --> 01:53:00.364
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi!

01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:02.491
The lecture went on a little long...

01:53:03.075 --> 01:53:04.201
but there you are.

01:53:04.368 --> 01:53:06.078
I saw you got the job.

01:53:06.245 --> 01:53:09.623
You are looking at the newest addition
to New Orleans General.

01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:10.624
Yes!

01:53:10.791 --> 01:53:12.501
So, that means you guys are stayin', right?

01:53:13.752 --> 01:53:16.505
I could have told you that last week, honey.

01:53:17.256 --> 01:53:20.300
Why have a medium as a friend
if you don't ask?

01:53:20.467 --> 01:53:21.635
- Facts.
- Ben.

01:53:22.302 --> 01:53:23.303
Hey!

01:53:25.264 --> 01:53:26.265
Hey.

01:53:26.431 --> 01:53:28.517
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

01:53:28.684 --> 01:53:29.685
Tell him.

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.854
Tell him. It's good news.

01:53:32.437 --> 01:53:34.439
I was voted as Vice President of my class.

01:53:34.606 --> 01:53:35.732
What?

01:53:35.899 --> 01:53:37.943
What? That's amazing!

01:53:38.110 --> 01:53:40.070
And guess who got ordained as a minister?

01:53:40.237 --> 01:53:41.697
Just in case you got any friends
who wanna get married.

01:53:42.406 --> 01:53:43.407
Okay.

01:53:43.574 --> 01:53:45.826
Come on, you two.
The chili's getting cold.

01:53:45.993 --> 01:53:47.202
- Okay, all right!
- Okay.

01:53:47.369 --> 01:53:48.370
Well, can I come in?

01:53:48.537 --> 01:53:51.748
Well, Ben, I should warn you
before you step inside...

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.210
this could change
the course of your entire life.

01:53:57.504 --> 01:53:59.298
Well, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

01:54:02.426 --> 01:54:03.510
All right, then welcome.

01:54:03.677 --> 01:54:04.678
All right.

01:54:36.126 --> 01:54:37.127
Nice!

01:54:37.377 --> 01:54:38.420
Cheers.

01:54:38.879 --> 01:54:40.255
To the afterlife!

01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:42.424
To the afterlife.

01:54:42.591 --> 01:54:43.550
To life!

01:54:56.438 --> 01:54:58.065
Wow. Look at that.

01:55:02.194 --> 01:55:03.278
It's great.
