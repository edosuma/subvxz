00:01.360 --> 00:04.568
- Previously on Hannibal...
- I can't be with you.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.591
- You are becoming. The dragon
is your higher self.

00:06.640 --> 00:12.738
- There's a family out there
who don't know he's coming.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.804
- They're not my family.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.741
And I am not letting them die.
You are.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.749
- What'd you say to him?
- Save yourself. Kill them all.

00:19.780 --> 00:22.214
Then I gave him
your home address.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.242
How's the wife?

00:30.690 --> 00:35.696
(drums and eerie music)

00:39.670 --> 00:41.797
- I look at my wife

00:41.840 --> 00:44.035
and I see her dead.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.676
I see Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi

00:48.710 --> 00:51.304
lying where Molly should be.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.444
- Do you see yourself
killing her?

00:56.590 --> 00:58.649
- Yes.

00:58.690 --> 01:01.818
Over and over.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.828
- It's hard to predict

01:03.860 --> 01:07.296
when brittle materials
will break.

01:07.330 --> 01:11.426
Hannibal gave you three years

01:11.470 --> 01:13.461
to build a family,

01:13.500 --> 01:17.163
confident that
he would find a way

01:17.210 --> 01:19.303
to take them from you.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.399
- And he has.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.088
What's he going
to take from you?

01:31.890 --> 01:33.858
- Is it important to you

01:33.890 --> 01:36.324
that he take something from me?

01:40.700 --> 01:44.363
- Hannibal has agency

01:44.400 --> 01:46.868
in the world.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.835
- Hannibal has no intention

01:49.870 --> 01:52.304
of seeing me dead

01:52.340 --> 01:56.447
by any other hand than his own,

01:56.480 --> 01:59.472
and only then

01:59.520 --> 02:01.579
if he can eat me.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.252
He's in no position

02:08.290 --> 02:10.679
to eat me now.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.891
- If you play,

02:15.930 --> 02:17.898
you pay.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.137
- You have paid dearly.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.200
It excites him to know

02:26.240 --> 02:28.800
that you are marked

02:28.840 --> 02:31.741
in this particular way.
- Why?

02:31.780 --> 02:34.772
- Why do you think?
(scoffing)

02:34.820 --> 02:37.948
- Bluebeard's wife. Secrets

02:37.990 --> 02:39.958
you're not to know,
yet sworn to keep.

02:39.990 --> 02:42.720
- If I'm to be Bluebeard's wife,

02:42.760 --> 02:46.218
I would have preferred
to be the last.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.530
- Is Hannibal

02:54.570 --> 02:57.801
in love with me?

02:57.840 --> 03:01.469
- Could he daily feel a stab

03:01.510 --> 03:03.842
of hunger for you

03:03.880 --> 03:06.576
and find nourishment

03:06.620 --> 03:10.181
at the very sight of you?

03:11.990 --> 03:14.185
Yes.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.753
But do you

03:18.790 --> 03:21.327
ache for him?

03:28.270 --> 03:31.501
- Will's thoughts are no more
bound by fear or kindness

03:31.540 --> 03:33.508
than Milton's were by physics.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.998
He is both free and damned
to imagine anything.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.417
- Now that he's imagined
the worst.

03:40.450 --> 03:42.543
- Like ducklings, we imprint

03:42.590 --> 03:44.581
on those ideas that
grab our attention.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.713
- What's got
your attention, Doctor?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.729
God, the Devil
and the Great Red Dragon?

03:49.760 --> 03:52.593
- Lest we forget the Lamb.

03:52.630 --> 03:55.451
- Will

03:55.500 --> 03:57.468
is the Lamb of God?

03:57.500 --> 03:59.764
- Hide us from the wrath
of the Lamb.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.599
- Who's "us"?

04:04.640 --> 04:07.677
- You, me

04:07.710 --> 04:10.406
and the Great Red Dragon.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.344
The Lamb's wrath touches
everyone who errs.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.644
_ His retribution
IS even more deadly

04:17.690 --> 04:19.908
than the Dragon's.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.884
- It is for you.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.819
- The seals
are being opened, Jack.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.896
The lamb is becoming a lion.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.868
"For the great day of his wrath

04:31.900 --> 04:34.494
is come; and who
shall be able to stand?"

04:34.540 --> 04:36.531
- I'll still be standing.

04:39.740 --> 04:41.731
- Is your conscience clear?

04:44.850 --> 04:47.819
- As clear as yours.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.818
- Righteousness is what

04:49.850 --> 04:51.841
you and Will have in common.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.858
"In righteousness the Lamb

04:53.890 --> 04:56.654
doth judge and make war."

04:56.690 --> 04:59.659
War against
the Great Red Dragon.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.397
- He's not the Dragon, you are.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.398
The Devil himself

05:05.430 --> 05:07.398
bound in the pit.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.331
- Then that makes you God, Jack.

05:11.370 --> 05:14.601
- Yes it does.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.006
- All gods demand sacrifices.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.603
(paper ripping)
(hissing)

05:53.920 --> 05:56.741
(screeching strings)

05:59.760 --> 06:03.127
(theme music)

06:22.510 --> 06:25.479
- We don't have anything else?

06:25.510 --> 06:28.877
- Eight people dead in a month.
We can't play the long game.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.979
You know and I know it's the
best way to bait him.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.113
- Got me on the hook,
now you're dangling me

06:33.160 --> 06:36.948
to catch a bigger fish.
- It was your suggestion.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.981
- And you're thrilled you didn't
have to make it.

06:39.030 --> 06:41.419
- You once fooled yourselves
into believing

06:41.460 --> 06:43.690
you were in control
of what was happening.

06:43.730 --> 06:48.599
Are you still under
that delusion?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.605
- The Dragon has a certain

06:55.640 --> 06:58.074
abstract curiosity about me.

06:58.110 --> 07:00.442
All psychopaths
are narcissists. They love

07:00.480 --> 07:03.210
to read about themselves.
If you were smart, Jack,

07:03.250 --> 07:05.480
you would use Freddie Lounds.
- She will need

07:05.520 --> 07:08.011
to interview you, Will.
Take your picture.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.882
- I'm in it now. Can't go home
as long as he's loose.

07:11.930 --> 07:15.718
So, I really bad-mouth

07:15.760 --> 07:18.797
the Red Dragon in TattleCrime.

07:18.830 --> 07:21.230
Give him a shot at me.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.238
- It's got to be
a really good shot.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.534
What about the setup?

07:27.540 --> 07:31.146
- Something open. Some place
where he can get close to me.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.148
- It'd feel like a trap to me.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.171
And it'll feel
like a trap to him.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.654
Unless you have
a professional voice

07:40.690 --> 07:43.124
who will legitimize
what you're saying.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.185
- Someone to hide
the wire on the snare.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.598
Are you volunteering?

07:49.630 --> 07:51.621
- No.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.596
I'd have to be a fool.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.666
- Since your commitment,

07:58.710 --> 08:00.803
you have written some brilliant
articles for The Northern

08:00.840 --> 08:02.808
Medical Journal of Psychiatry.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.806
- Thank you, Frederick.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.011
- I just finished
your most recent piece.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.541
Extraordinary stuff.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.912
- A particularly good one.
- It may be my favorite.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.754
I have seen a lot of hostility.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.951
But this
was quantifiably bitchy.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.560
Do you think I am your nemesis?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.818
- No. Nemesis? No.

08:25.870 --> 08:29.237
- You refuted my entire book.
- It didn't hold up to scrutiny.

08:29.270 --> 08:31.306
- Of course it didn't.
I was lying.

08:31.340 --> 08:34.776
On your behalf.

08:34.810 --> 08:37.973
To save your life.

08:38.010 --> 08:40.649
You r_efuted
your Insanity defense.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.944
I went out on a limb for you

08:42.990 --> 08:45.914
and you climbed up there
and sawed it off.

08:45.950 --> 08:49.078
- "Wood burns because it has the
proper stuff In It;

08:49.120 --> 08:51.657
and a man becomes famous because

08:51.690 --> 08:53.897
he has the proper stuff in him."

08:53.930 --> 08:57.866
You don't have
the proper stuff, Frederick.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.859
- I am a best-selling author.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.131
The journals only

09:05.170 --> 09:07.138
still publish your writing

09:07.180 --> 09:09.136
for the freak value

09:09.180 --> 09:11.171
of your byline.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.346
The attention given
to you is dwindling

09:17.390 --> 09:20.553
since you have been overshadowed
by another creature.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.648
That book is writing itself.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.726
I think I'll call it
The Dragon Slayer.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.761
All I need is the ending.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.933
- Fate has a habit
of not letting us choose our own

09:36.970 --> 09:39.200
endings, Frederick.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.201
- This is the ending fate
has chosen for you.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.179
Your teeth will go
and your strength.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.986
Nobody will be afraid
of you anymore.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.988
After Dr. Bloom's reign,

09:54.020 --> 09:58.252
you will be out in the ward.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.690
The young ones
will push you around

10:00.730 --> 10:02.721
and use you for sex.

10:04.730 --> 10:08.268
All you'll get to read
is what you write on the wall.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.268
You have seen the old ones.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.778
They cry

10:12.810 --> 10:14.869
when they do not like

10:14.910 --> 10:18.243
the stewed apricots.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.386
Oh,

10:28.420 --> 10:31.924
I'm just going to leave
an extra copy

10:31.960 --> 10:34.656
of my book right over here.
- Thank you, Frederick.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.066
- I've personalized it for you.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.236
Are you here to remonstrate me
with "I told you so"s?

10:49.280 --> 10:52.716
- That's not why I'm here.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.014
- She's here because
we need someone

10:55.050 --> 10:57.086
who is less concerned
about the truth

10:57.120 --> 10:59.816
than the best story.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.420
So, Dr. Chilton, you just lay
out your theories. Will will

11:02.460 --> 11:06.328
aggravate them for the record.
- You're making statements

11:06.360 --> 11:10.023
no investigator would ever make
and no straight newspaper
would credit.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.937
- You're not a straight
newspaper. You sell T-shirts

11:12.970 --> 11:16.360
that say, "The Tooth Fairy
is a One-Night Stand."

11:16.400 --> 11:18.960
- I can get you one, if you
like. You a small or a medium?

11:19.010 --> 11:22.229
Small, I bet. They aren't
selling so well since

11:22.280 --> 11:25.704
you started calling him
"The Dragon."

11:25.750 --> 11:27.718
- The killer's objection
to the name "The Tooth Fairy"

11:27.750 --> 11:29.889
is likely grounded
in the homosexual

11:29.920 --> 11:31.888
implication of the word "fairy."

11:31.920 --> 11:35.083
Tedious, I know, but if
you really want to piss him off,

11:35.120 --> 11:38.180
that's what you should call him.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.893
- Very well. Tooth Fairy it is.

11:49.270 --> 11:52.979
- The Tooth Fairy's actions
indicate a projective delusion

11:53.010 --> 11:56.070
compensating for intolerable
feelings of inadequacy.

11:56.110 --> 11:59.443
Smashing mirrors ties these
feelings to his appearance.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.074
- And not only
is the Tooth Fairy insane,

12:02.120 --> 12:04.111
he is ugly and impotent.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.350
- There's a strong bonding

12:08.390 --> 12:12.258
of aggressive and sexual drives
that occurs in sadists at
an early age.

12:12.290 --> 12:15.418
- He's a vicious, perverted,
sexual failure.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.020
An animal.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.004
- The savage acts aimed
primarily at the women

12:25.040 --> 12:27.076
and performed
in the presence of families

12:27.110 --> 12:29.271
are clearly strikes
at a maternal figure.

12:29.310 --> 12:32.541
- The Tooth Fairy is the product
of an incestuous home.

12:32.580 --> 12:36.414
- This is the child
of a nightmare.

12:36.450 --> 12:39.146
- Will, I think we need
a key shot of you

12:39.190 --> 12:41.818
here in your
"Washington hideaway."

12:41.860 --> 12:45.159
- I'd love something
of you in a bathrobe

12:45.190 --> 12:47.420
sitting at a desk,
poring over this

12:47.460 --> 12:50.566
artist's conception
of the Fairy. Hmm?

12:50.600 --> 12:55.094
- I'll stand by the window.
And make sure you can see the
fountain and the Capitol dome.

12:55.140 --> 12:57.358
Red Dragon will need to be able
to find this place,

12:57.410 --> 13:00.174
if he wants to.

13:00.210 --> 13:03.077
Frederick, would you like
to be in the photograph?

13:03.110 --> 13:05.146
- One for the dust jacket.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.310
- (whispered): Let's see, up.

13:11.350 --> 13:14.080
And... yeah.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.864
(tinkling bells)

13:37.150 --> 13:40.244
This whole procedure
is way too passive for my taste.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.885
We are playing games
in the dark of the moon.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.048
- He thinks he can do anything.
Maybe he thinks he can stop.

13:48.290 --> 13:52.021
If he can hold off
until we catch him, maybe
we can help him make it stop.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.597
- He almost killed
your wrfe and son.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.421
- Hannibal almost killed them.

13:59.470 --> 14:03.236
- Alright. Pedestrian traffic
falls off around 7:15.

14:03.270 --> 14:06.103
You should go for a walk,
say 8:30 or so.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.233
He'll have to cross
open ground to get close.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.271
- He'll want to get close.
- I've got snipers

14:10.310 --> 14:12.369
with night-vision on the roofs.
You'll be wearing

14:12.410 --> 14:15.208
body armour.
- 7 out of 11 times,

14:15.250 --> 14:17.218
he's gone
for the headshot, Jack.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.241
- Yeah...

14:22.220 --> 14:25.018
(ding)
- That's absurd.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.654
That's not what
I said at all. Dr. Lecter

14:27.700 --> 14:31.124
gave misleading answers
in my interviews.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.365
I will refute his refutations

14:33.400 --> 14:37.006
in my new book, Blood
and Chocolate. Supermarket

14:37.040 --> 14:39.531
tabloids love Hannibal Lecter
more than alien abductions.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.674
That is his demographic now.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.974
We know who his fans are.

14:44.010 --> 14:46.001
Oh!

15:21.380 --> 15:24.213
(gasping)

15:37.600 --> 15:39.591
I'll get you a blanket.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.728
- Oh, my back hurts.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.121
Oh, my skin.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.564
Did I get burned?
Did I, did I get burned?

16:18.610 --> 16:21.431
I hope, dear God,
I am not burned.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.471
- Burned?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.118
Burned.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.015
Burned.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.027
No.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.494
You just rest there.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.566
- What am I doing here?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.638
- Atoning,

16:49.670 --> 16:51.661
Dr. Chilton.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.078
(chair creaking)

16:56.110 --> 16:58.647
(exhale)
- I have not

16:58.680 --> 17:00.671
seen your face.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.046
I could not,
I could not identify you.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.816
I do not know

17:09.860 --> 17:12.055
what you look like.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.698
- Do you know

17:16.730 --> 17:18.698
who I am?

17:18.730 --> 17:21.460
- No. No. I do not want to know,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.502
believe me.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.274
- According to you,

17:29.310 --> 17:32.199
I'm a vicious,

17:32.250 --> 17:34.548
perverted

17:34.580 --> 17:38.038
sexual failure.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.057
An animal.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.526
You know now, don't you?

17:47.560 --> 17:49.551
- Yes.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.259
- Why did you lie, Dr. Chilton?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.666
(whining)

18:04.580 --> 18:06.571
Do you

18:06.610 --> 18:09.738
understand what I'm doing?

18:09.780 --> 18:12.578
- No. No!

18:12.620 --> 18:15.259
But I think

18:15.290 --> 18:18.157
I have an opportunity
to understand.

18:18.190 --> 18:20.624
Then all my readers

18:20.660 --> 18:23.322
could understand, too.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.328
- Do you feel privileged?

18:29.300 --> 18:32.861
- It is a privilege, but...

18:32.910 --> 18:37.142
I have to tell you I am scared.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.241
Man to man,

18:41.280 --> 18:43.646
I am scared.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.646
And it is--

18:45.690 --> 18:48.318
it is very hard to--

18:48.360 --> 18:51.727
uh, to concentrate
when you are scared.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.728
If you have got a great idea,

18:53.760 --> 18:56.422
you do not need to scare me

18:56.460 --> 18:59.293
for me to be impressed. OK?

18:59.330 --> 19:01.298
- "Man--
(gasp)

19:01.340 --> 19:03.331
to man "

19:03.370 --> 19:06.703
You use that phrase
to imply frankness.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.208
But you see,

19:12.250 --> 19:15.344
I am not a man.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.541
I have become

19:17.590 --> 19:19.546
Other

19:19.590 --> 19:21.649
and more than a man.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.220
Do you think

19:30.270 --> 19:33.262
God is in attendance here?

19:36.770 --> 19:38.738
Are you

19:38.770 --> 19:40.772
praying to him now?

19:40.810 --> 19:43.472
(grunting)

19:43.510 --> 19:46.570
- We pray to God

19:46.610 --> 19:48.612
mostly when we are scared.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.646
- And does God

19:52.690 --> 19:54.681
help you?

19:56.690 --> 19:58.681
- No.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.260
I don't know. I don't know.
I do not know.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.564
I do, I do-- I ought--

20:05.600 --> 20:08.489
I do not think about it after.
I ought to.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.668
- You ought to.
- I ought, I ought to.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.799
- There are so many things

20:16.840 --> 20:19.547
that you ought to understand.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.745
And in a little while,

20:23.790 --> 20:26.782
I will help you understand.

20:32.330 --> 20:35.629
- No, I do not want
to see your face!

20:35.660 --> 20:37.628
- When you turn around,
you will open your eyes

20:37.670 --> 20:39.626
and look at me,

20:39.670 --> 20:42.764
or I will staple your eyelids

20:42.800 --> 20:44.836
to your forehead.

20:57.550 --> 20:59.541
(doorbell rings)

21:04.690 --> 21:06.851
If you make a sound,

21:06.890 --> 21:08.892
I will kill her.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.648
- I don't like surprises.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.376
I bet you don't, either.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.638
I tried to call you.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.857
May I come in?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.593
I won't be long.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.631
I asked my taxi to wait.

21:50.670 --> 21:53.468
How are you feeling?

21:53.510 --> 21:55.671
- OK.

21:55.710 --> 21:58.907
- Your office_said
you were snck.
- The flu.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.684
You shouldn't be here.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.711
- I brought you soup.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.496
I...

22:21.540 --> 22:23.804
I didn't come

22:23.840 --> 22:27.003
just to give you soup, D.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.908
I guess I'm guilty
of liking you.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.113
Demonstrably guilty.

22:34.150 --> 22:36.118
And I know you like me, too.

22:36.150 --> 22:39.984
-Ido.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.989
- I've learned that withdrawal
can be a strategy to av0|d pain.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.086
I have a deep vein

22:47.130 --> 22:49.394
of cripple's anger in me;

22:49.430 --> 22:51.421
while I can't get rid of it,

22:53.540 --> 22:56.031
I've made it work for me.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.732
It's fueled my independence.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.478
I'm not so scarred by life

23:03.510 --> 23:06.638
that I'm incapable of love.

23:08.650 --> 23:11.039
I hope you aren't, either.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.081
Enjoy the soup.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.008
- Do you want to know

23:35.040 --> 23:38.498
what I am?

23:40.950 --> 23:44.613
- More than anything.
I was afraid to ask.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.727
- Look.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.955
- Do you see now?
- Yes.

23:58.130 --> 24:01.588
- Do you see?
- Yes.

24:04.070 --> 24:06.436
- Do you see?

24:10.180 --> 24:12.842
- Do you see?
- Yes.

24:16.820 --> 24:19.038
- Do you see?
- Yes.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.979
(strangled sound)
- Do you

24:25.030 --> 24:29.057
see?
- Yes.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.126
- Do. You. See?

24:32.170 --> 24:34.138
- GOD!

24:34.170 --> 24:36.138
- Do you see?

24:36.170 --> 24:39.139
- Please no.
- No what?

24:39.170 --> 24:42.139
- Not me.
- Are you gomg to tell
more lies about me, Dr. Chilton?

24:42.180 --> 24:44.148
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.
- Why did you tell lies,

24:44.180 --> 24:46.148
Dr. Chilton?
- No, it was the police

24:46.180 --> 24:48.614
told me to.
They, they, they said it.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.538
- You quote Will Graham.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.241
- Graham told the lies.

24:53.290 --> 24:55.258
Graham.

24:55.290 --> 24:58.157
- Will you tell the truth now?
About me.

24:58.190 --> 25:01.193
About my work. My...

25:01.230 --> 25:03.698
Becoming.

25:03.730 --> 25:06.267
My art.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.961
Dr. Chilton,

25:10.140 --> 25:12.108
this

25:12.140 --> 25:14.108
art?

25:14.140 --> 25:16.131
- Art.

25:18.610 --> 25:21.113
- You said

25:21.150 --> 25:24.244
that I, who see

25:24.290 --> 25:27.088
more than you, am insane.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.556
I, who have pushed the world

25:30.590 --> 25:32.979
so much further than you,

25:33.030 --> 25:35.328
are insane.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.126
I have dared more than you.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.138
I am the Dragon

25:41.170 --> 25:44.901
and you call me insane?

25:44.940 --> 25:47.306
(whispered): Before me,

25:47.340 --> 25:49.604
you are

25:49.640 --> 25:53.269
a slug in the sun.

25:53.310 --> 25:56.746
You are priw
to a great Becoming

25:56.780 --> 25:59.340
and you recognize nothing.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.915
It is in your nature

26:01.960 --> 26:04.884
to do one thing correctly

26:04.930 --> 26:08.821
and before me you tremble.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.896
Fear is not

26:10.930 --> 26:12.898
what you owe me.

26:12.930 --> 26:17.196
You owe me awe.

26:25.110 --> 26:27.101
For your journey home.

26:29.150 --> 26:31.846
Ice,

26:31.890 --> 26:33.881
we'll need that.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.624
Before we go,

26:43.830 --> 26:46.196
I think we should tape

26:46.230 --> 26:48.232
for a little while.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.981
Look straight down the lens.

27:13.390 --> 27:17.224
Repeat after me.

27:19.230 --> 27:21.698
That's all,

27:21.740 --> 27:24.732
Dr. Chilton.

27:24.770 --> 27:28.331
You did very well.
- You will let me go now?

27:28.380 --> 27:32.043
- I will.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.049
Although

27:39.450 --> 27:41.759
there is one way

27:43.790 --> 27:47.055
that I can help you
better understand

27:50.870 --> 27:53.168
and remember.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.397
- I want to understand.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.261
And I've got a very good memory.

27:59.310 --> 28:03.269
(gibberish)

28:03.310 --> 28:05.346
(hissing)

28:13.220 --> 28:15.950
(continuous screaming)

28:28.370 --> 28:31.931
(piano music)

28:46.990 --> 28:50.949
- Hand delivered.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.053
May I open it privately?

28:57.100 --> 28:59.819
- You may not.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.324
- Dr. Chilton often offended me,

29:31.370 --> 29:34.430
so I certainly understand
the sentiment.

29:42.540 --> 29:45.407
- Where's the other one?

29:45.450 --> 29:48.977
- This one can provide you
anything the other one can.

29:53.450 --> 29:56.180
I'm sorry, Jack. The tragedy
of what's happened

29:56.220 --> 29:58.381
to Frederick has put me
in an excellent humour.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.490
- Dr. Chilton
disappeared yesterday,

30:01.530 --> 30:04.829
under armed escort.
- You pretended to burn

30:04.870 --> 30:08.397
Freddie Lounds in a wheelchair
to flush me out.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.261
What were you pretending
to do with Frederick Chilton?

30:11.310 --> 30:13.904
- He profiled the Dragon.

30:13.940 --> 30:17.171
For Freddie Lounds.

30:17.210 --> 30:20.099
- We wanted to enrage him.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.141
- Congratulations.

30:25.550 --> 30:28.485
You could've provided
anything Dr. Chilton could.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.058
That_would've been
your le I was tasting.

30:32.090 --> 30:34.524
Again.

30:34.560 --> 30:38.394
- You publicly discredited
Dr. Chilton.

30:38.430 --> 30:40.421
By refuting him,

30:40.470 --> 30:42.597
you orchestrated
his end by prow.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.608
- You orchestrated
his end, Alana.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.006
You saw the hole
and let him roll

30:47.040 --> 30:50.498
right into it.
That's professional discourtesy.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.309
- I have had a great privilege.

30:59.350 --> 31:03.286
I have seen with wonder and awe

31:03.320 --> 31:07.222
the strength
of the Great Red Dragon.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.251
All that I said

31:09.300 --> 31:12.360
was lies from Will Graham.

31:14.700 --> 31:18.409
I have blasphemed
against the Dragon.

31:18.440 --> 31:22.035
Even so,

31:22.080 --> 31:24.469
the Dragon is merciful.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.319
Because I was forced to lie,

31:29.350 --> 31:32.410
he will be more merciful to me

31:32.450 --> 31:35.578
than to you, Will Graham.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.680
Reach behind you and feel

31:38.730 --> 31:41.119
the small knobs

31:41.160 --> 31:43.390
on the top of your pelvis.

31:43.430 --> 31:47.298
Feel your spine between them;

31:49.670 --> 31:52.400
that is the precise spot

31:52.440 --> 31:55.079
where the Dragon
will snap your spine.

31:55.110 --> 31:58.705
There is much for you to dread.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.548
From my own lips,

32:01.580 --> 32:04.481
you will learn
a little more to dread.

32:07.320 --> 32:11.654
(muffled, continuous screaming)

32:30.340 --> 32:32.570
- Would you like to talk about

32:32.610 --> 32:35.044
what happened
with Frederick Chilton?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.553
- The divine punishment

32:44.590 --> 32:47.457
of a sinner

32:47.490 --> 32:51.119
mirrors the sin being punished.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.461
- Contrapasso. You play,

32:56.500 --> 32:59.105
you pay.

33:03.410 --> 33:07.073
- Chilton languished
unrecognized

33:07.110 --> 33:09.613
until "Hannibal the Cannibal."

33:12.350 --> 33:15.057
He wanted the world
to know his face.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.217
- And now he doesn't have one.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.596
- (whispered):
Damned if I will feel.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.791
- We are all making our way

33:29.840 --> 33:32.035
through the Inferno.

33:33.740 --> 33:36.231
Dante's pilgrims.
- No,

33:36.280 --> 33:38.771
we're not pilgrims. We're pets.

33:38.810 --> 33:43.042
And the Great Red Dragon
kills pets first.

33:44.850 --> 33:48.354
- You put your hand
on Dr. Chilton's shoulder

33:48.390 --> 33:50.381
in the photograph.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.151
Touch gives the world

33:55.200 --> 33:57.623
an emotional context.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.764
The touch of others

33:59.800 --> 34:02.098
makes us who we are.

34:02.140 --> 34:06.236
It builds trust.

34:06.270 --> 34:10.104
- I put my hand on his shoulder
for authenticity.

34:10.140 --> 34:13.746
- To establish

34:13.780 --> 34:17.409
that he really told you
those insults

34:17.450 --> 34:19.441
about the Dragon?

34:21.820 --> 34:23.788
Or maybe you wanted

34:23.820 --> 34:26.653
to put Dr. Chilton at risk?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.751
Just a little?

34:34.470 --> 34:37.166
- (whispered): I wonder.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.339
- Do you have to wonder?

34:45.150 --> 34:47.345
- No.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.818
- What did you think
the Great Red Dragon would do?

35:00.190 --> 35:02.829
You were curious what would
happen, that's apparent.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.535
Is this what you were expecting?

35:10.600 --> 35:13.728
- I can't say I'm surprised.

35:16.410 --> 35:18.378
- Then you may as well

35:18.410 --> 35:21.174
have struck the match.

35:25.550 --> 35:27.415
That's

35:27.450 --> 35:29.509
participation.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.752
Hannibal Lecter

35:36.800 --> 35:39.598
does have agency in the world.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.402
He has you.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.772
(escalating strings)

36:35.620 --> 36:38.919
(inaudible)

36:38.960 --> 36:41.793
- He did Chilton like it looked
like you did Freddie Lounds.

36:41.830 --> 36:44.469
Hannibal said he would.
In his own way.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.866
- Hannibal told him to.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.994
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.861
I had the SWAT team.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.837
- Chilton said your name when
they brought him into the ER.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.303
He's trashed.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.341
You oughta get ready for this.

37:06.650 --> 37:08.652
(Sigh)

37:38.750 --> 37:40.741
- Frederick, it's Will Graham.

37:49.830 --> 37:52.867
I'm sorry this happened to you.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.307
- You set ne uh.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.646
You knew it.

38:05.680 --> 38:08.001
You set ne uh.

38:11.390 --> 38:15.315
You tut your hand on ne

38:15.360 --> 38:17.419
in the ticture,

38:20.130 --> 38:22.792
like a tet.

38:22.830 --> 38:24.889
- Can you understand
what he's saying?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.461
- He said,

38:31.510 --> 38:33.535
"You set me up.

38:33.570 --> 38:37.336
You knew it.
You put your hand on me

38:37.380 --> 38:39.439
in the picture, like a pet."

38:39.480 --> 38:42.472
(deep breath)

38:45.390 --> 38:47.449
Did you see anything?

38:47.490 --> 38:50.516
- A 'lack

38:50.560 --> 38:53.449
woman...

38:53.490 --> 38:55.629
and she was 'lind...

38:55.660 --> 38:58.925
- "A black woman. She's blind."

38:58.970 --> 39:01.120
- Reba.

39:01.170 --> 39:05.038
The Dragon said her name
when he called Lecter.

39:11.010 --> 39:14.810
- Not much longer now.

39:20.790 --> 39:24.009
(door opening and closing)

39:24.060 --> 39:26.881
(whimpering)

39:48.080 --> 39:50.071
(continuous ticking)

39:59.630 --> 40:01.928
(whimpering)

40:08.840 --> 40:10.899
If I untie you

40:10.940 --> 40:12.805
and let you sit up,

40:12.840 --> 40:14.774
will you be good?

40:18.080 --> 40:22.676
- I, i...
(gulplng)

40:25.050 --> 40:28.986
I didn't know you cared
this much about me.

40:29.020 --> 40:32.729
I'm glad you feel that way,
but you scared me with this.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.228
I never hurt you.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.127
I never wanted to.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.469
Let's just be friends

40:40.500 --> 40:42.468
and have a good time
and forget about this--

40:42.500 --> 40:45.708
- Shut up.

40:45.740 --> 40:48.129
I'm going to tell you something.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.536
The most important thing

40:50.580 --> 40:52.946
that you will ever hear.

40:55.150 --> 40:59.780
Sermon-on-the-Mount important.
Ten Commandments important.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.618
Got it?
- Yes, D. I don't--

41:02.660 --> 41:04.981
- Shut up.

41:05.030 --> 41:09.490
Some remarkable events

41:09.530 --> 41:13.899
have happened
in Chicago and Buffalo.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.637
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

41:16.670 --> 41:18.638
- No.

41:18.670 --> 41:21.901
- It's been on the news a lot.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.976
Two groups of people

41:24.010 --> 41:26.069
were changed.

41:28.080 --> 41:32.710
Leeds. And Jacobi.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.881
The police think
that they were murdered.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.751
Do you know now?

41:47.770 --> 41:50.136
Do you know

41:50.170 --> 41:54.607
what they call the-- the Being

41:54.640 --> 41:56.608
that visited those people?

41:56.640 --> 41:59.245
- The Tooth Fai--
- Think.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.271
(gasp)
Answer

42:01.310 --> 42:03.676
correctly.
- (whispered): It's, uh...

42:03.720 --> 42:06.883
Dragon something.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.014
Dragon... Red Dragon.

42:10.060 --> 42:14.622
-Iam

42:14.660 --> 42:17.925
the Dragon.
