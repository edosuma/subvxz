WEBVTT

00:01.142 --> 00:02.636
On your knees!

00:08.441 --> 00:10.350
Colonel Ryan, where is our money?

00:10.818 --> 00:14.234
- Where you bastards will never find it.
- I wouldn't count on that.

00:14.739 --> 00:16.899
How long do you think
you can keep this thing a secret?

00:16.991 --> 00:19.743
If I found out, so will others.

00:20.036 --> 00:22.408
Then it's a good thing we're in Iraq.

00:22.497 --> 00:24.822
People like you get killed here
all the time.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.520
Maybe you're the one
who shouldn't count on that.

00:28.544 --> 00:30.905
If you're referring to the marines
you were travelling with,

00:30.963 --> 00:32.078
they're dead.

00:32.924 --> 00:36.756
We also intercepted the three packages
you attempted to mail stateside.

00:36.844 --> 00:38.173
It's over.

00:39.847 --> 00:43.512
- Then at least tell me why.
- We all have our orders.

00:43.768 --> 00:47.468
Unfortunately for you,
we kill anyone who learns about ours.

00:48.231 --> 00:51.018
Well, I was kind of hoping
for a little more than that.

00:52.693 --> 00:54.935
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

00:55.029 --> 00:58.694
Sir, it's clear
all the way back to the entrance.

01:00.076 --> 01:03.659
By the way,
it was four packages, not three.

01:46.622 --> 01:48.995
It's my favourite part of the day.

01:49.584 --> 01:50.782
Debbie.

01:52.295 --> 01:54.833
And Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

01:55.381 --> 01:58.417
Since when did you start giving women
your work address?

01:58.509 --> 02:01.712
- Since I broke up with Michelle.
- The social worker?

02:01.804 --> 02:04.129
- Yeah, we had a little misunderstanding.
- Like what?

02:04.223 --> 02:05.576
Well, she was under the impression

02:05.600 --> 02:07.557
that we were
in an exclusive relationship.

02:07.643 --> 02:09.054
Imagine that!

02:09.562 --> 02:11.186
So what happened?

02:11.481 --> 02:15.229
She broke into my apartment
and filled my closet with dog crap.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.060
Really? I knew there was a reason
I liked her.

02:19.155 --> 02:21.300
I still have her number.
Maybe you two could get together

02:21.324 --> 02:22.818
and boil rabbits or something.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.744
Not my style, Tony.
I would just shoot you.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.416
And that would be the reason
for rule number 12.

02:31.501 --> 02:32.746
Rule 12?

02:33.294 --> 02:35.666
Never date a co-worker. Come on.

02:36.547 --> 02:39.584
Director wants to see us. Now.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.180
Three weeks ago,
a marine officer transporting $2 million

02:47.266 --> 02:50.433
of Saddam Hussein's cash
was ambushed in Iraq.

02:50.853 --> 02:53.523
His driver was found dead on scene.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.266
The officer and the cash were MIA.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.860
The officer was Colonel Will Ryan,
Agent Gibbs.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.025
What?

03:02.740 --> 03:04.282
The FBI sent this footage

03:04.367 --> 03:06.858
of the main terminal
at Washington Dulles airport.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.111
Two days ago he was spotted
re-entering the country

03:09.205 --> 03:11.032
under an assumed name.

03:13.209 --> 03:14.952
The question is why.

03:15.044 --> 03:17.369
Some kind of classified op, sir?

03:17.755 --> 03:21.622
If it is, no one at the Pentagon
knows anything about it, Agent Todd.

03:21.717 --> 03:24.718
The FBI believes
he may have staged the ambush

03:24.804 --> 03:26.381
and taken the money for himself.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.177
That's not possible, sir.
If he's back in the States,

03:29.267 --> 03:31.508
I guarantee he's got
a damn good reason.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.891
If so,
it's one I'm looking forward to hearing.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.522
We need to find him and bring him in.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.148
If he's turned on us,

03:37.233 --> 03:39.688
it could compromise half our operations
in Iraq.

03:40.945 --> 03:44.065
The Colonel would rather die
than betray our country, sir.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.564
I know.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

03:46.659 --> 03:47.987
As of today,

03:48.077 --> 03:50.615
he just made the FBI's
"Most Wanted" list.

04:04.093 --> 04:05.753
He's kind of cute.

04:06.429 --> 04:08.836
So, you're into older guys, Abby?

04:09.140 --> 04:11.927
Sure. Dating older is a sign of maturity.

04:12.184 --> 04:14.011
What's the oldest you've gone?

04:14.103 --> 04:18.017
Sixty-five. My biology professor. You?

04:18.107 --> 04:21.190
- Twenty-six. My drycleaner.
- I rest my case.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.444
What do you got, Abs?

04:23.738 --> 04:26.655
This is from the airport
surveillance video.

04:26.991 --> 04:28.844
It looks like Colonel Ryan
is talking to someone

04:28.868 --> 04:30.659
but I can't tell who.

04:31.579 --> 04:33.986
Pull all the airport tapes
that match our time frame.

04:34.081 --> 04:35.492
I'm already on it.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.326
- Tony.
- Yeah.

04:38.085 --> 04:39.521
What's left of Colonel Ryan's hummer

04:39.545 --> 04:41.064
was shipped back
to Camp Lejeune last week.

04:41.088 --> 04:42.333
I can have it here tomorrow.

04:42.423 --> 04:45.092
- His personal effects?
- Yeah, I'm checking on that.

04:45.176 --> 04:47.963
Meaning you forgot.
That's good work, Abs.

04:50.848 --> 04:52.639
I just realised something.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.219
Gibbs never gives me
any compliments?

04:54.310 --> 04:55.389
No.

04:55.478 --> 04:58.681
Maybe it's not that
you're dating younger women,

04:58.773 --> 05:00.730
but that they're dating an older man.

05:10.868 --> 05:12.659
What's "SERE" school?

05:12.745 --> 05:15.532
Survival, evasion, resistance
and escape.

05:15.623 --> 05:16.654
Why?

05:16.749 --> 05:18.727
Ryan served as an instructor there
for three years.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.001
His OQR reads like
something out of Soldier of Fortune.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.876
- What do you think is in here?
- Probably some part for his boat.

05:25.966 --> 05:29.217
No, I don't think so.
The postage is from overseas.

05:31.222 --> 05:32.301
Tony.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.722
He's standing right behind me, isn't he?

05:37.186 --> 05:39.558
Do you want me
to open this for you, boss?

05:40.940 --> 05:42.019
No.

05:43.234 --> 05:46.151
The Colonel's personal effects
are en route from Iraq.

05:46.237 --> 05:47.357
They'll be here in 48 hours.

05:47.446 --> 05:50.198
Anything interesting in his jacket, Kate?

05:50.282 --> 05:52.192
Iraq hasn't caught up
with his records yet,

05:52.284 --> 05:55.072
but judging by his background,
he won't be easy to find.

05:55.162 --> 05:58.163
Unless you happen to know the man.
I have a pretty good idea where to look.

05:58.249 --> 05:59.363
Where?

05:59.458 --> 06:02.874
Check the sedan out of the motor pool.
I'll tell you on the way.

07:03.147 --> 07:06.017
Anytime the Colonel took leave,
he'd come here.

07:06.108 --> 07:08.516
Not exactly my idea of a vacation.

07:10.154 --> 07:12.063
You should see it in the summertime.

07:12.990 --> 07:14.449
Do all marines build boats?

07:14.533 --> 07:16.453
Just the ones that have been married
a few times.

07:16.535 --> 07:19.951
- Why's that?
- The other ones can afford to buy one.

08:07.962 --> 08:10.085
- Clear.
- Got a body in here.

08:15.386 --> 08:19.253
Blood's not fully clotted.
This is recent. Three, maybe four hours.

08:19.348 --> 08:21.590
Looks like your Colonel
was interrogating this guy.

08:21.684 --> 08:24.009
Guess he didn't like what he had to say.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.261
Colonel Ryan didn't do this.

08:26.438 --> 08:27.814
How can you tell?

08:28.399 --> 08:30.522
Somebody stormed this place.

08:32.236 --> 08:34.394
He wouldn't shoot the lock
off his own door.

08:34.864 --> 08:36.607
Any idea who, boss?

08:38.491 --> 08:39.736
Not yet.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.932
You think he knows more
than he's telling us?

08:43.956 --> 08:46.992
Come on, Kate,
this is Gibbs we're talking about.

08:47.084 --> 08:48.662
Of course he does.

08:48.752 --> 08:49.867
No, that's all right.

08:49.962 --> 08:52.418
We need the MCRT vehicle
and the ME.

08:52.506 --> 08:54.713
Oh yeah,
and I'm also gonna need a dog.

08:55.426 --> 08:58.261
- Well then, find me one.
- Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

08:58.345 --> 09:00.137
Right. We'll be here.

09:00.389 --> 09:01.634
DiNozzo!

09:05.185 --> 09:07.143
What do you make of this?

09:09.857 --> 09:12.526
So, you think it's Ryan that's wounded?

09:13.402 --> 09:16.522
That makes sense if he was in
the bedroom when his company arrived.

09:16.614 --> 09:19.817
They blast the lock,
Ryan pops out of the bedroom,

09:19.909 --> 09:22.993
he starts to run, takes a hit.
Keeps on going out the back door.

09:23.078 --> 09:25.404
It still doesn't explain our body in there.

09:25.497 --> 09:27.573
Either he was already here
or your shooter stopped

09:27.666 --> 09:29.991
- to tie him to the chair.
- You hear that?

09:30.085 --> 09:31.165
Hear what?

09:32.171 --> 09:34.543
Sounds like a beeper.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.631
It's probably the guy's watch.

09:37.635 --> 09:40.754
I checked his wrist, Tony.
He wasn't wearing one.

10:14.421 --> 10:17.624
- Are you sure it was a bomb, Gibbs?
- Yes, DiNozzo.

10:18.217 --> 10:21.218
For the last time, yes,
I'm sure it was a bomb.

10:21.679 --> 10:23.089
If you say so.

10:23.180 --> 10:26.300
EOD is sure taking their sweet time
getting here.

10:27.977 --> 10:31.227
Sorry we're late.
Gerald got us lost several times.

10:31.313 --> 10:33.105
Me? You had the map.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.106
We have our own problems here,
Ducky.

10:35.192 --> 10:36.271
Yeah, I can see that.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.566
The FBI take over
our crime scene again?

10:38.654 --> 10:41.145
- Gibbs thought he saw a bomb.
- What do you mean "thought"?

10:42.408 --> 10:45.112
- Do I really have to say it?
- Say what?

10:46.370 --> 10:48.113
Yes, Kate. Say what?

10:51.166 --> 10:53.836
You need glasses, Gibbs.
Are you happy?

11:09.226 --> 11:13.390
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite catch that last part.

11:24.192 --> 11:28.236
I must say, you seem to have
a remarkably fine set of teeth.

11:28.696 --> 11:30.903
Yeah, for an extra
from Pirates of the Caribbean.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.615
I heard that was very good.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.444
- The ride?
- The movie.

11:34.535 --> 11:36.243
You know, Johnny Depp?

11:38.581 --> 11:41.119
Tony's right.
You really need to get out more, Gibbs.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.327
Duck, this is my only link
to Colonel Ryan.

11:45.421 --> 11:46.619
I need to know who he is.

11:46.714 --> 11:49.632
That's understandable,
but I'm afraid it's gonna take some time.

11:49.717 --> 11:50.962
How much?

11:51.594 --> 11:53.753
Well, fingerprints are certainly
out of the question.

11:53.846 --> 11:57.678
It would, of course, be a simple matter
to match him to his dental records,

11:57.767 --> 12:00.056
assuming we knew
where they were located.

12:00.144 --> 12:01.224
We don't.

12:01.312 --> 12:03.269
Is there any reason to suppose
he was associated

12:03.356 --> 12:05.847
with the armed forces
or a federal agency?

12:06.317 --> 12:08.524
- Possible.
- Then we can run his DNA.

12:08.611 --> 12:12.479
I should be able to get a sample
for analysis even from this.

12:12.573 --> 12:14.946
Although, I do remember one case
in Malaysia...

12:15.034 --> 12:16.991
Ducky, how long?

12:17.829 --> 12:21.328
- Ten days, perhaps nine.
- No. No, doesn't get it done.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.454
Well, I don't suppose any of you
bothered to take his photograph

12:25.545 --> 12:28.214
before you ran screaming
from the place.

12:32.051 --> 12:35.088
Hey, that was not a scream.
That was yelling...

12:36.556 --> 12:37.801
Loudly.

12:39.017 --> 12:41.009
Kate, can you sketch him?

12:41.102 --> 12:43.937
I can try, but I didn't get
a really good look at his face.

12:44.022 --> 12:45.332
Tony can help you with the recall.

12:45.356 --> 12:48.143
Nobody talks about this case
unless it's with me.

12:51.487 --> 12:53.147
- Ducky?
- Yeah?

12:53.364 --> 12:56.864
Did you know Colonel Ryan?

12:57.493 --> 13:00.198
- No, only by reputation.
- Which was?

13:00.288 --> 13:03.538
Professional. Driven.
His work was his life.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.539
So, he was pretty much Gibbs?

13:08.796 --> 13:09.911
Gibbs.

13:13.468 --> 13:16.884
Sir? What the hell is going on?

13:16.971 --> 13:19.213
- Did you get my package?
- Yes, sir.

13:19.307 --> 13:21.050
I was also at your cabin.

13:21.142 --> 13:24.226
Look, Gunny, I don't have much time.
They could be tracing this call.

13:24.312 --> 13:25.474
I have to meet with you.

13:25.563 --> 13:28.897
Considering you just made
the FBI's "Most Wanted" list, I agree.

13:28.983 --> 13:32.482
You need to get to NCIS
as fast as possible, sir.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.965
Negative. That's the first place
they'll try to reacquire me.

13:34.989 --> 13:36.020
Who?

13:36.115 --> 13:38.010
That's kind of
what I'm trying to figure out, Gunny.

13:38.034 --> 13:40.192
You gotta trust me.
We can protect you, sir

13:40.286 --> 13:42.765
- until we figure out...
- They've already tried to kill me twice.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.549
I don't intend on giving them
another chance.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.245
- Where, then?
- At the bar where you bought that flask.

13:47.335 --> 13:50.170
- When?
- Tonight. 2100 hours.

13:50.254 --> 13:52.627
- I'll be there.
- Make sure you're not followed.

13:52.715 --> 13:56.380
I don't know how high this thing goes,
but trust no one, Gunny.

14:05.937 --> 14:08.475
- Think he'll show, sir?
- He'll show, Lieutenant.

14:08.564 --> 14:11.731
People change, sir.
How do we know we can trust him?

14:11.818 --> 14:13.691
Call it a gut feeling.

14:14.987 --> 14:18.771
- Permission to speak freely?
- When has that ever stopped you?

14:21.619 --> 14:23.659
What if you're wrong, sir?

14:30.711 --> 14:33.416
Then there's a first time for everything.

14:41.806 --> 14:43.051
Damn it.

14:43.391 --> 14:45.597
I'm gonna start over.

14:45.810 --> 14:48.894
God. You're killing me, Kate, not again.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.767
You think it's easy
sketching from memory?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.235
I need a break.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.151
I took an art class, once.

14:59.407 --> 15:02.324
Let me guess.
It involved nude female models?

15:02.410 --> 15:04.983
Yeah, but that wasn't the only reason
I took the class.

15:05.079 --> 15:07.535
We drew fruits or something, too.

15:08.833 --> 15:11.787
- This I gotta see.
- I thought you'd never ask.

15:15.381 --> 15:19.758
So, are you gonna take off your clothes
or do I just draw you like that?

15:20.219 --> 15:21.500
Kidding.

15:21.804 --> 15:23.678
One dead guy, coming up.

15:25.099 --> 15:27.590
Eyes are always the hardest part
for me.

15:27.685 --> 15:28.883
Me, too.

15:29.270 --> 15:31.678
The nose was kind of angular, right?

15:31.772 --> 15:33.516
And flat on the top.

15:34.025 --> 15:35.898
All right, there we go.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.350
Done.

15:41.616 --> 15:43.407
You are so pathetic.

15:43.826 --> 15:47.658
- I never said I passed the class, did I?
- You done yet, Kate?

15:52.251 --> 15:56.035
I was drawing and then Tony asked if I...

15:57.340 --> 15:59.379
You know, I don't think I can sketch him.

15:59.467 --> 16:00.712
Yeah, I can see that.

16:00.801 --> 16:02.924
I want both of you
to start trying to find out

16:03.012 --> 16:05.384
who Colonel Ryan was working with
in Iraq.

16:05.473 --> 16:07.845
Concentrate on anyone responsible

16:07.934 --> 16:10.935
for finding or shipping
US currency in-country.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.892
- Where are you going?
- Tracking down another lead.

16:13.981 --> 16:15.938
- Where?
- Not here.

17:07.034 --> 17:09.156
Hi. That'll be $18.95.

17:10.871 --> 17:12.034
Here's your change, sir.

17:12.123 --> 17:13.830
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.365
I don't think Gibbs should know
I'm working with you, sir.

17:28.388 --> 17:31.094
There was a time when you would have
trusted Gunnery Sergeant Gibbs

17:31.183 --> 17:32.512
with your life, Lieutenant.

17:32.602 --> 17:34.261
What if he's followed, sir?

17:34.353 --> 17:37.188
If we're both compromised,
who's left to stop them?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.934
Okay, we split up. But stay close.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.771
- Always, sir.
- Good.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.752
- Colonel.
- Gunny, it's been too long.

18:06.469 --> 18:08.794
Here, give an old man a hand up.

18:08.929 --> 18:11.337
- We need to talk, sir.
- Let's talk while we play some pool.

18:11.432 --> 18:12.974
- You're wounded.
- Not badly.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.810
- I need some answers, sir.
- Yeah, so do I.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.689
What happened in Iraq?

18:23.694 --> 18:26.150
My task force was charged
with recovering money

18:26.238 --> 18:28.314
Saddam had stashed
around the country.

18:28.407 --> 18:29.818
And we did a damn good job.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.826
We found close to $30 million
in US currency.

18:32.995 --> 18:35.403
- Lot of cash.
- A lot of temptation.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.787
I started noticing irregularities
in the accounting

18:40.878 --> 18:43.665
and when I investigated,
strange things started to happen.

18:43.756 --> 18:44.787
Like what?

18:44.882 --> 18:48.417
My reports to higher headquarters
would disappear, or be ignored.

18:48.511 --> 18:51.962
Shipments would be redirected
or cancelled last minute.

18:52.056 --> 18:53.897
It still doesn't explain
your disappearing act.

18:53.974 --> 18:55.552
Why didn't you go directly to Centcom?

18:55.643 --> 18:58.038
Because someone a hell of a lot higher
up the chain of command

18:58.062 --> 18:59.521
was behind it.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.101
I set up a decoy.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.763
One vehicle,
$2 million in cash to draw them out,

19:03.859 --> 19:06.694
and it worked,
just not the way I intended.

19:07.029 --> 19:09.105
They killed my men and captured me.

19:10.282 --> 19:11.314
Who?

19:11.409 --> 19:14.363
The CIA? NSA?
Hell, NCIS for all I know.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.493
These guys had "black ops"
stamped all over them.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.620
They're stealing money
to fund something

19:18.708 --> 19:20.644
and they're killing anyone
who finds out about it.

19:20.668 --> 19:22.411
What about the man
I found in your cabin?

19:22.503 --> 19:23.666
Do you have him in custody?

19:23.754 --> 19:27.088
He's dead.
A bullet in the forehead, execution-style.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.803
- And you think I killed him?
- Why don't we start with who he was?

19:31.887 --> 19:35.339
I was trying to find out.
I caught him following me two days ago.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.848
How long exactly have you been
in the States, Colonel?

19:39.603 --> 19:40.718
A week and a half.

19:40.813 --> 19:44.063
I've stayed one step ahead of them
until today, when they tried to kill me.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.727
Look, we gotta get you to NCIS.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.796
- Get this figured out.
- Have you been listening to me?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.940
These people are on the inside.
This could be anybody.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.990
Sir, with all due respect,
it's not a request.

19:53.576 --> 19:54.951
We can protect you.

19:56.287 --> 19:58.410
I'm sorry, Gunny,
but I can't take that chance.

19:59.874 --> 20:01.582
Someone has to stop these people.

20:03.753 --> 20:06.540
Colonel, you're wounded

20:07.089 --> 20:09.461
you're alone, you look like hell.

20:10.092 --> 20:13.093
You're not gonna be able to stay
one step ahead for very much longer.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.887
Who says I'm alone?

20:15.347 --> 20:18.099
Give me something to work with
at least.

20:18.309 --> 20:22.306
There was a video tripod in your cabin.
Did you tape the interrogation?

20:22.396 --> 20:24.519
- Yes, I did.
- Get me the tape.

20:24.607 --> 20:27.394
It was damaged
when they shot my place up.

20:27.568 --> 20:30.485
You would be amazed
what my people can do with technology.

20:31.113 --> 20:33.438
If you can fix this,
you can prove I didn't shoot that man.

20:33.741 --> 20:36.908
Here. You might find a shot
of the men who attacked me.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.407
- I'll be in touch.
- When?

20:41.499 --> 20:45.283
When I find out more about the people
behind this conspiracy.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.294
We have a bit of an enigma here,
Gibbs.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.877
I spent all day scanning tapes
from the airport

20:56.972 --> 20:59.890
looking for Colonel Ryan.
And I mean, all day.

20:59.975 --> 21:02.727
- And guess what?
- He wasn't on any of them.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.558
Yeah.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.309
Lucky guess.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.353
Okay, would you like to guess
what I found out

21:10.444 --> 21:12.603
from the original tapes the FBI sent us?

21:12.696 --> 21:15.733
- It was from more than two days ago.
- Right.

21:16.659 --> 21:18.219
But can you tell me
when they were from?

21:18.244 --> 21:19.987
Week and a half ago.

21:20.079 --> 21:23.163
Did I mention that
I have spent all day doing this?

21:23.249 --> 21:25.241
Do you wanna tell us
how you know all this, boss?

21:25.334 --> 21:26.828
FBI lied to us.

21:29.004 --> 21:32.254
They've been using us to find Ryan
this whole time.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.663
Do you think Colonel Ryan's innocent?

21:38.338 --> 21:39.833
Gibbs seems to think so.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.961
The man disappears
from a war zone with $2 million.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.961
Ends up in the States
under an assumed name.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.342
- What's that tell you?
- He leads an interesting life?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.589
What about the dead body
we found in his cabin?

21:49.683 --> 21:51.592
Like I said, Gibbs thinks so.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.426
You don't always have to follow
his lead, you know.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.306
I don't always follow his lead.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.191
- Like when?
- Like...

22:00.194 --> 22:02.186
Remember that girl Michelle
I told you about?

22:02.279 --> 22:03.654
- The one with the dog?
- Yeah.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.693
Gibbs met her once, told me to run
while I still had the chance.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.404
Agent DiNozzo.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.407
Agent Todd.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.914
Agent Fornell.
Why am I not surprised to see you?

22:15.501 --> 22:19.035
Just paying a visit.
Thought you might enjoy some coffee.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.043
Is this the FBI's idea of an apology?

22:22.132 --> 22:24.006
Think of it more as a peace offering.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.845
It's gonna take more
than your house special blend

22:26.929 --> 22:28.091
after the stunt you pulled.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.555
I thought as much.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.220
Croissant?

22:34.978 --> 22:36.437
It's a start.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.188
Where's Gibbs?
We have a lot to talk about.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.350
You got that right, Fornell.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.363
Do you mind telling me what you were
doing in Georgetown last night?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.906
Why don't you ask your men?

22:46.990 --> 22:48.900
Your Colonel's in a lot of trouble, Gibbs.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.736
Level with me
and I might be able to help.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.073
I have a better idea.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.265
You level with me
and I'll decide if I need your help.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.867
No, it's not gonna work that way.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.334
Tony, Kate, entertain our guests.

23:00.838 --> 23:04.586
Agent Fornell and I
are gonna have a little chat in private.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.843
I feel sorry for your boss.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.092
And why is that?

23:10.180 --> 23:12.137
You obviously don't know Fornell
very well.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.263
We've worked with him before.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.094
We just don't particularly like him.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.680
So you do know him.

23:27.614 --> 23:28.812
Tobias,

23:30.284 --> 23:31.398
you lied to me.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.869
Don't take it personally.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.526
I'd lie to my own mother
if I thought it'd help solve a case.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.616
Are you gonna lie to me now?

23:40.127 --> 23:43.460
That depends on what you were doing
in Georgetown last night.

23:43.589 --> 23:47.456
- Colonel Ryan is not a thief.
- I don't really care one way or the other.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.630
My job is to find him.

23:48.719 --> 23:51.126
Then that's a problem
because I do care.

23:51.221 --> 23:54.222
I know you and Ryan served together.
I can appreciate that.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.099
But innocent people usually don't run.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.136
They do if someone's trying to kill them.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.638
And just who is it
who's trying to kill him?

24:00.731 --> 24:03.138
At this point, maybe you.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.810
That's a good one, Gibbs.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.655
You had to know we'd check the tape

24:10.741 --> 24:13.148
and figure out
that it's more than two days old.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.696
Sure. I just didn't think you'd get it done
that fast.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.831
What changed?

24:23.921 --> 24:25.878
Why the rush to find him right now?

24:28.508 --> 24:31.296
One of my men disappeared
two days ago.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.801
Just after he reported
sighting the colonel.

24:37.184 --> 24:41.395
And you put me on the trail
and hoped that I'd lead you right to him.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.556
If it was your man, are you telling me
you wouldn't do the same?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.987
Next time, just ask for our help.

24:56.078 --> 24:59.197
You don't exactly have a reputation
for playing well with others, Gibbs.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.243
Maybe I might've been able
to help save him.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.787
What do you mean, save him?

25:12.094 --> 25:14.086
He was getting married next month.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.714
- We don't know it's Agent Carlson yet.
- I'm sorry, but I'm afraid it is.

25:17.808 --> 25:22.766
The dental records are conclusive.
Our John Doe is your missing agent.

25:23.313 --> 25:26.100
- Now your colonel is a murderer.
- Colonel Ryan didn't do this.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.899
And how could you possibly know that?

25:27.985 --> 25:30.736
There was evidence of a break-in
and a gun battle at his cabin.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.232
- We need to see it.
- So do we.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.647
Unfortunately it was incinerated
in the explosion.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.070
That's pretty convenient.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.911
Hey, all this started
because you people lied to us.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.154
Agent Todd, if Ryan's innocent,

25:41.248 --> 25:43.917
how did my man end up handcuffed
at his cabin in the first place?

25:44.001 --> 25:45.578
I'll get you your evidence.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.708
- How?
- Any way I can.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.252
Your boss is playing a dangerous game.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.089
- He doesn't play games.
- Well, neither do we.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.553
If I find Gibbs is helping Ryan

25:55.637 --> 25:58.674
I'll have him charged
as an accessory to murder.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.262
Let's go.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.396
- He's right. We have to do something.
- Like what?

26:08.191 --> 26:10.003
I mean, Gibbs obviously
doesn't trust us enough

26:10.027 --> 26:11.735
to tell us what's going on.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.489
You don't honestly believe that, do you?

26:14.906 --> 26:15.986
Don't you see?

26:16.074 --> 26:18.565
Gibbs is doing his very best
to protect you.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.745
- From what?
- From being accessories yourselves.

26:21.872 --> 26:25.704
Look, he's willing to risk his own life
and reputation for a friend,

26:26.585 --> 26:28.542
but he's not gonna risk yours.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.375
So what do we do, Ducky?

26:31.465 --> 26:34.964
You let him know
that he's not alone in his convictions.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.183
- Abby?
- Hey, Gibbs.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.977
What did you wanna see me about?

26:49.483 --> 26:51.771
I'm retesting Colonel Ryan's vehicle
to make sure,

26:51.860 --> 26:55.063
but I don't think this damage came
from an Iraqi weapon system.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.435
What then?

26:58.867 --> 27:02.318
The chemical signatures
are matched to an American AT4.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.119
It's a light anti-tank weapon.
It looks like friendly fire.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.950
I don't know if "friendly" had anything
to do with it.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.787
- Thanks, Abs.
- Gibbs?

27:11.797 --> 27:15.296
Actually, we asked you
to come down here for another reason.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.127
- We?
- She means us.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.639
- We need to talk to you, boss.
- About what?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.425
About what you're not telling us.

27:24.935 --> 27:26.808
We know you made contact
with Colonel Ryan.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.980
Tony lifted your cell phone
while you were charging it today.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.638
You received a phone call last night
around 1900

27:32.734 --> 27:35.937
from a bar payphone in Georgetown,
McPhinley's pub.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.858
- You lifted my cell phone?
- Borrowed.

27:40.283 --> 27:43.154
But we showed your photo and Ryan's
to the bartender this afternoon.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.614
He remembered seeing the both of you
between 2100 and 2130.

27:46.706 --> 27:50.835
Which explains why you knew Ryan had
been in the country more than two days.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.662
You "borrowed" my cell phone?

27:52.754 --> 27:56.170
Look, we understand the situation
and we just wanna help.

27:56.258 --> 27:59.508
We can't back your play
if we don't know what it is.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.780
Now, let me get this straight.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.339
What you're saying
is you stole my cell phone.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.183
I think next time we can skip
the cell phone part, Kate.

28:11.189 --> 28:15.685
This tape could prove that Colonel Ryan
did not kill Fornell's agent.

28:15.986 --> 28:19.271
Do you think you can find out
what's on that for me?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.070
All you had to do was ask, Gibbs.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.650
Okay.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.037
Okay, I will try to remember that
for next time.

28:34.671 --> 28:38.005
Tony, touch my cell phone again,

28:38.633 --> 28:39.713
I'll break your fingers.

28:44.014 --> 28:46.053
You know, he really does like you.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.515
I don't know anything
about a conspiracy.

28:50.604 --> 28:54.352
I told you, I'm an FBI agent.
I've never even been to Iraq.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.586
What about you, Lieutenant Cameron.
Do you believe him?

28:56.610 --> 28:57.689
Neither do I.

28:57.777 --> 28:58.857
Who the hell are you?

28:58.945 --> 29:00.274
We're asking the questions!

29:00.363 --> 29:03.199
What is the money being used for?
Who is running your unit?

29:04.034 --> 29:06.322
They found us, grab the camera!

29:07.787 --> 29:09.827
The end of the tape
received the most damage.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.203
I haven't been able
to pull much info from it.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.617
The video processing lab
would probably have better luck.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.202
I'd like to keep this in-house.
See what you can do.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.859
Anyone catch a glimpse of the person
he was talking to off-camera?

29:19.883 --> 29:22.255
No, but he called him
Lieutenant Cameron.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.467
You ever hear of him, Gibbs?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.837
The Colonel and I used to work
with a Lieutenant Cameron.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.967
- Do you think it's him?
- No.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.930
- Why not?
- Because he died 14 years ago.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.227
Was there anyone in the bar with him
last night?

29:35.315 --> 29:36.478
Not that I could tell.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.891
Kate,
run down every Cameron you can find

29:38.985 --> 29:40.183
in the Pentagon database.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.357
You got it.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.569
Abby, you and Tony transcribe the tape.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.064
I had a tough time following
his line of questioning.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.733
- Where are you going?
- Home. To think.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.524
There's no need for that, Gunny.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.067
You're not looking too good, sir.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.119
Looks can be deceiving.

30:32.205 --> 30:35.289
I watched the tape.
The man following you was FBI.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.665
Now you know what I'm up against.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.084
I told you, they're everywhere.

30:41.881 --> 30:46.010
- Who were you talking to off-camera?
- You didn't recognise his voice?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.590
- Whose voice?
- Your company XO.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.759
You're working with
Lieutenant Cameron?

30:54.853 --> 30:56.477
Just like old times, Gunny.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.805
Sir, Lieutenant Cameron's dead.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.770
Yeah. Yeah, I thought so, too.

31:02.569 --> 31:05.356
This group has been active
since Desert Storm.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.277
They tried to recruit him
but he fooled them.

31:08.366 --> 31:11.284
He died in my arms, sir.
You were standing right there.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.240
We saw what they wanted us to see.
When are you gonna get it?

31:14.331 --> 31:16.822
I get it. You need help.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.289
- I'm taking you in, sir.
- Put the gun down.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.785
No. No, I can't do that.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.126
It was the second place I looked.

31:35.018 --> 31:38.434
I know it's a shock, Jethro,
but maybe you'll believe your own eyes.

31:38.521 --> 31:39.850
Lieutenant?

31:49.324 --> 31:51.151
He doesn't look happy to see me,
Colonel.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.665
This group has been influencing
national policy for years, Gunny.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.999
The bad intel we were fed on Iraq,
the breakdown on info prior to 9/11.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.916
Lieutenant Cameron
was working with them?

32:07.008 --> 32:09.333
- More like infiltrating.
- It's part of a small cell.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.219
We've been trying
to trace the organisation

32:11.304 --> 32:13.344
and find out who's at the top.

32:13.431 --> 32:16.101
Well, then we need help.
We should go to my office.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.429
Negative.

32:17.519 --> 32:20.092
They'd kill us before we even got close
to the building.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.723
The way I see it, Colonel,
we're a little outgunned here.

32:23.817 --> 32:24.896
Well,

32:26.611 --> 32:28.189
we made some preparations.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.478
What kind?

32:30.573 --> 32:33.029
You'd be amazed at what you can
get your hands on these days.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.569
Is that why you needed the $2 million
you took from Iraq?

32:36.663 --> 32:37.943
What makes you think we have it?

32:38.039 --> 32:39.892
They tore your cabin apart
looking for something.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.353
Then they must have been pretty upset
when they didn't find it.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.535
Well, yeah. Yeah, they were.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.922
They blew it up.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.504
- Where's the money?
- Some place safe.

32:52.595 --> 32:54.339
We need to tell him.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.633
I don't know, sir.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.302
What if he doesn't believe us?

32:58.393 --> 33:01.976
Colonel, look, you contacted me.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.432
You want my help,
you need to level with me.

33:05.525 --> 33:09.274
No, it's not that we don't trust you,
Gunny. The question is,

33:09.362 --> 33:11.651
are you prepared to believe it?

33:14.367 --> 33:17.866
- Gibbs is two hours late.
- And he's not answering his cell.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.705
Should we swing by his house?

33:19.789 --> 33:22.161
No need. I've already been there.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.493
Did you order coffee, Kate?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.248
Your boss has crossed the line.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.399
We'll be sure to let him know
the next time we see him.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.882
If I were you, I'd start looking.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.254
Why is that?

33:32.469 --> 33:34.508
Because this is a warrant for his arrest.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.509
The perfect base of operations,

33:42.228 --> 33:44.137
it's in my aunt's name.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.308
- Nobody's used it for years.
- Base for what?

33:48.401 --> 33:49.895
To fight a war.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.028
They're not the only ones

33:55.116 --> 33:56.860
who know how to smuggle things
out of Iraq.

33:56.951 --> 33:58.512
What exactly are you planning, Colonel?

33:58.536 --> 34:01.206
I'm planning on exposing them,

34:01.539 --> 34:03.164
by force if necessary.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.041
What about the missing money?

34:05.126 --> 34:08.329
Half of it's here, half at another location
with the lieutenant.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.422
How long have you known
he was still alive?

34:14.511 --> 34:15.755
Almost two years now.

34:15.844 --> 34:18.052
- Where is he now?
- He's close.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.518
Who you calling?

34:24.728 --> 34:26.437
I need to contact my team,

34:27.565 --> 34:30.601
see if they got any information
out of that video tape you gave me.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.614
I understand,
but I don't know where he is.

34:42.705 --> 34:45.706
Where the hell are you? Fornell's here
with a warrant for your arrest.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.784
Well, then it's a good thing
I'm not there, then.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.202
This is serious.
He thinks you're with Colonel Ryan.

34:50.295 --> 34:52.040
Well, he's smarter than he looks.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.708
See if you can get Abby to pull whatever
she can off that video tape for me.

34:55.802 --> 34:56.964
What are we looking for?

34:57.053 --> 35:00.718
Anything that'll prove that Colonel Ryan
did not kill that FBI agent.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.550
We've got a solid contact.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.551
Whatever you do,
don't come back here.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.807
I wasn't planning on it.

35:05.895 --> 35:09.229
- I'll be in touch.
- I just hope you know what you're...

35:11.067 --> 35:12.182
We've got a location.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.361
It originated from the
Warehouse district in Fairfax, Virginia.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.486
All teams stand by
to receive intercept orders.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.531
- Roger that.
- We got him.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.947
It's not much.
Most of the data was corrupt.

35:24.163 --> 35:27.164
- For all we know, it could be Ryan.
- If we're gonna get Gibbs out of this,

35:27.250 --> 35:29.919
we need more
than a shadow puppet, Abby.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.749
I've been rendering several frames
over the past hour,

35:32.839 --> 35:36.172
using a modified algorithm
I snuck out of NASA on my last visit.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.426
It's based on
the Mars Global Surveyor's ability

35:39.512 --> 35:43.592
to interpolate information
from corresponding pixels,

35:43.683 --> 35:45.225
so you can build a composite...

35:45.310 --> 35:47.183
Today, Abs?

35:47.770 --> 35:51.982
- That is very Gibbs of you, Tony.
- Thanks, I've been practising.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.479
Looks like we have a face on Mars.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.572
I've seen this guy before.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.743
In the files Gibbs had us run down

36:03.828 --> 36:06.236
on units responsible
for transferring money in Iraq.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.204
I think he's a reserve army colonel.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.619
Let's roll.

36:11.794 --> 36:13.454
Looks like Kate's been practising, too.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.630
Let's just hope we get the real one back
when this is over.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.473
I need to know
what Cameron's been telling you.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.140
Enough to convince me
that they have people in every branch

36:34.233 --> 36:35.265
of our government.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.670
How do you know you can believe him?

36:36.694 --> 36:39.150
He saved my life in Iraq.
He has no reason to lie.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.241
Yeah?

36:53.336 --> 36:56.088
We've got a positive ID
on one of the shooters at the cabin.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.129
Reserve Army Colonel Mike Granger.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.173
He rotated out of Iraq two weeks ago.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.667
- To where?
- Virginia.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.964
He owns a small business in Fairfax
and he's there now.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.456
You ready to write down an address?

37:14.649 --> 37:15.847
Got it.

37:17.944 --> 37:22.107
I know who's behind your conspiracy.
We ID'd him off the tape.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.945
- Is that his address?
- Yeah, it is.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.178
We can pick him up for questioning.

37:26.202 --> 37:29.737
No, no, no. You don't cut off
a conspiracy by taking out foot soldiers.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.393
- You strike at the head.
- Colonel, you've gotta trust me on this.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.540
Trust you? Trust you
like the lieutenant trusted you

37:34.627 --> 37:36.438
or have you forgotten
about Lieutenant Cameron?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.704
No, sir! I have not forgotten him.

37:38.798 --> 37:42.499
I think about him every night!
Have you forgotten him, sir?

37:43.886 --> 37:46.460
Spread out, go, go! Go, go!

37:47.181 --> 37:48.296
Right.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.305
It's the FBI! Put your hands in the air!

38:01.237 --> 38:03.313
NCIS! Cease fire!

38:03.489 --> 38:06.443
- You set me up!
- Then why are they shooting at me?

38:07.243 --> 38:09.283
Stay down and let me do the talking.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.615
In sight.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.367
Find them.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.081
Subject on target.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.953
Hold your fire!

38:16.753 --> 38:18.626
NCIS! Cease fire!

38:19.172 --> 38:20.547
We've got a runner!

38:21.674 --> 38:23.049
Cease fire!

38:28.890 --> 38:30.763
Damn it! Stop shooting!

38:30.933 --> 38:33.603
- We need to talk.
- You're under arrest.

38:33.686 --> 38:34.884
For what?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.306
For pissing off the FBI.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.275
Get used to it.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.353
Give me one reason I don't charge you

38:44.447 --> 38:46.938
with aiding and abetting
a suspected murderer right now.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.610
I know where Colonel Ryan's headed.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.287
- Where?
- Your men are trigger-happy, Fornell.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.195
Let me bring him in.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.603
You're not exactly in a position
to be making demands, Gibbs.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.038
Do you want him or not?

39:00.838 --> 39:04.290
- If you screw me on this...
- I'll consider it a bonus.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.448
What makes you think
he's coming here?

39:09.472 --> 39:11.096
Granger tried to kill the colonel.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.973
Your agent got caught in the middle.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.454
The colonel had enough weapons
and explosives in that warehouse

39:15.478 --> 39:16.676
to take out half of DC.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.373
How high does he think
this conspiracy goes?

39:18.397 --> 39:19.975
That's what he's trying to find out.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.104
Let me go!

39:23.069 --> 39:25.821
You take a shot at him,
you answer to me.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.490
I can live with that.

39:29.575 --> 39:31.016
This is the last time I'm gonna ask.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.113
Who are you working for?
The CIA, huh? The FBI?

39:34.497 --> 39:36.205
- For ourselves.
- No!

39:36.833 --> 39:38.624
It goes higher than just your greed!

39:38.709 --> 39:41.082
We risked our lives
bringing down Saddam.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.997
Why shouldn't we take
a little of his money?

39:47.510 --> 39:50.879
Do you think he'll talk if I blow
his kneecap off next, Lieutenant?

39:50.972 --> 39:53.842
- Who's in there with him?
- An old friend.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.224
Stay here. I'll bring him out.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.688
Last chance.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.475
Who's behind it?

40:01.774 --> 40:04.645
FBI, CIA, whoever you want.
Please don't shoot me.

40:05.027 --> 40:06.819
I wouldn't waste the bullet.

40:15.163 --> 40:19.160
Colonel, I told you
we couldn't trust the Gunny.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.789
Put the gun down, sir.
There is no conspiracy.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.955
He led them to the warehouse.
You can't believe a thing he says, sir.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.675
The lieutenant's right.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.883
- Thank you, sir.
- Put the gun down!

40:33.389 --> 40:35.216
I told you to wait in the hall.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.786
As much as I'd like to,
I'm not gonna let him shoot you, Gibbs.

40:37.810 --> 40:41.060
- Drop it! Now!
- This whole thing was a set up!

40:41.480 --> 40:44.434
Why would you do that?

40:46.235 --> 40:47.943
I don't understand.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.235
Neither did Lieutenant Cameron
when he died, sir.

40:50.323 --> 40:53.739
- I'm not dead, sir! I'm right here.
- I can see that, Lieutenant!

40:53.826 --> 40:57.242
Lieutenant Cameron bled out
in my arms, sir.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.744
- I couldn't save him.
- Shut up, Gunny!

41:03.628 --> 41:06.000
Where is the lieutenant, Colonel?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.876
Is he behind me?

41:10.051 --> 41:11.593
I said shut up!

41:20.561 --> 41:23.313
Don't do this to me. Not again.

41:24.273 --> 41:26.562
The lieutenant died a long time ago, sir.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.106
There's a part of you
that I know remembers that.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.316
That's not...

41:32.406 --> 41:35.443
No, that's not true. That can't be true.

41:39.455 --> 41:42.290
Give me the gun, Colonel.
Let me get you some help.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.721
Sir?

42:01.560 --> 42:03.470
Colonel! Colonel!

42:03.562 --> 42:05.970
If you wanna shoot somebody,
shoot me!

42:06.065 --> 42:09.516
Lieutenant Cameron died saving my life!

42:19.996 --> 42:21.194
Colonel.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.875
Cameron's gone.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.452
I don't understand.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.376
It's okay.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.210
None of us ever do.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.429
Though it's rare
for paranoid schizophrenia

42:41.517 --> 42:44.968
to strike a man this late in life,
it's not unheard of.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.056
I'm hoping that
with the right medication

42:47.148 --> 42:49.021
he can return to a relatively normal life.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.061
Just because you're paranoid

42:52.153 --> 42:54.940
doesn't mean
people aren't out to get you.

42:55.781 --> 42:59.150
Any idea why he fixated
on Lieutenant Cameron, Gibbs?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.368
Yeah. Some.

43:07.335 --> 43:08.615
Corpsman!

43:08.711 --> 43:11.961
Hold on, Lieutenant Cameron!
You gotta hold on!

43:13.674 --> 43:15.168
I can't, Gunny.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.381
Colonel, I don't understand.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.183
I don't understand.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.305
I don't understand.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.186
I don't understand.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.822
I don't understand.
