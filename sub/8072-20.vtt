00:07.841 --> 00:09.343
Hey, Roseanne.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.944
Jackie, what are
you doing here?

00:10.978 --> 00:12.980
You're supposed to be out buying
me an anniversary present.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.216
I'm still looking.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.418
I want to be sure I get you
something you've always wanted.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.920
Can you get me into the
witness relocation program?

00:22.356 --> 00:23.224
Trust me.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.093
I will get you something nice.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.694
I mean 20 years.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.928
That's a biggie.

00:27.961 --> 00:28.929
David, did you know--

00:28.962 --> 00:30.131
No, Jackie.

00:30.164 --> 00:33.101
He doesn't know what we
want for our anniversary.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.034
Oh, OK.

00:34.068 --> 00:34.968
Oh.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.004
Because I thought
maybe something

00:37.037 --> 00:39.307
might just pop out of his head.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.274
What?

00:40.308 --> 00:41.675
Nothing.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.977
What do you got planned
for the big event?

00:44.011 --> 00:45.546
Oh, it's going to be so great.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.047
We're going to go
all out this time.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.682
You know?

00:48.716 --> 00:52.186
Starting with a really romantic
prime rib dinner and everything

00:52.220 --> 00:55.356
because, you know, the 20th
anniversary is the red meat

00:55.389 --> 00:56.790
and liquor anniversary.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.497
Do you know what
you're getting him yet?

01:03.531 --> 01:06.567
Well, it's kind of hard
to surprise him with a gift

01:06.600 --> 01:08.869
when I give him a
gift every single day.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.039
You know, the magic that is me.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.341
Ah, yeah.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.677
We keep waiting for
you to run out of that.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.148
Anyway I did have this
one idea for a gift.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.048
But I don't know.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.183
It's kind of embarrassing.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.351
Oh, come on.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.553
Embarrassing is good.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.887
OK.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.724
Well, you know how, like,
this year I'm kind of thinner?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.326
You know, on account
of when I lost

01:32.360 --> 01:38.366
my appetite working around food
all the time and you and Mom?

01:38.399 --> 01:42.303
So I thought I'd get one
of those boudoir photos.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.304
You know?

01:43.337 --> 01:44.305
Is that completely nuts?
- No.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.273
That's great.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.474
I just thought
they cost too much.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.608
No.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.576
I've been doing really
good at saving my money

01:48.609 --> 01:49.610
and I've been
stealing your tips.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.081
His own private centerfold.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.850
Dan must have been a
very good boy this year.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.888
Well, you know he's been with
the company for 20 years now.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.391
And this is kind of
like his gold watch.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.858
You know?

02:04.892 --> 02:09.963
Plus it'll get him all
hot and everything.

02:09.997 --> 02:10.864
Excuse me.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.867
Do you guys know I'm here?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.303
Jeez, David.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.271
I didn't know you were
such a sensitive kid.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.639
Well, he sure is, Jackie.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.873
And you've embarrassed him.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.108
Just look at his face.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.848
Nice camouflage, zit boy.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.851
Oh God.

Hey.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.635
What are you doing?

03:21.669 --> 03:22.936
I'm wrapping your
present from DJ.

03:22.970 --> 03:23.837
Awesome.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.038
What'd he get us?

03:25.072 --> 03:27.908
Well, if I tell you that,
then you might tell DJ

03:27.941 --> 03:29.977
and then he wouldn't
be surprised.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.648
But this is something
that you can open now.

03:34.682 --> 03:35.783
Hey.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.851
A gift certificate to
Marty's Big and Tall.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.219
Yeah.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.355
So you can get a nice sport coat
for your anniversary dinner.

Huh.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.725
Man with two jackets.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.227
I'll be the talk of the town.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.796
I don't know how to thank
you except to ask you

03:48.829 --> 03:50.130
to wrap Rosie's present for me.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.499
Oh, let me see.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.166
Oh, Dan.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.868
A shoe rack.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.475
What do you think?

04:01.509 --> 04:05.913
She is not going
to be expecting this.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.681
It's a good present, Dan.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.783
Good, good, good.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.252
Really good.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.454
This is bad, Dan.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.455
It's bad.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.756
It's really bad.
- What's wrong with it?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.325
Dan, I shouldn't even
be telling you this.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.693
She is spending so much
money on you this year.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.894
Oh man.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.496
She's just doing it
because she loves you, Dan.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.364
Oh sure.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.765
She says that.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.635
But she knows I don't have any
money to buy her anything nice.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.970
If she really loved
me, she'd buy me crap.

04:30.003 --> 04:30.871
This is love.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.840
Oh, Dan.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.107
She knows you're broke.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.610
But you could at least get
her something thoughtful.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.479
Don't you think I wanted to?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.314

second on my list.

Anything but a shoe rack.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.617
Shoe rack.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.985
Don't think practical, Dan.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.253
Think romantic.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.755
And I know you're no good at it.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.158
But it's not your
fault. You're a man.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.862
Probably why my shoes
don't match my bag.

What do you think?
- I like it.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.440

05:06.474 --> 05:07.408
No.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.378
Not the right size.

Nice try, Deej.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.684
Why don't you go join
those other kids over there

05:16.717 --> 05:17.851
playing in that pant leg?

05:25.258 --> 05:26.794
That jacket looks
just great on you, sir.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.363
You know black is very slimming.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.364
I'm not here because I'm big.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.033
I'm here because I'm tall.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.134
I see.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.971
Then that jacket makes
you look very short.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.074
So what do you think?
- Under $100.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.544
Sold.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.212
I'll just take a
minute and pin these up.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.114
And then you'll be
out of here in a sec.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.349
Man, you guys do
great business here.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.585
Oh yeah.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.953
The recession is still on.

05:52.986 --> 05:58.426
But I think that fitness craze
is finally starting to pass.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.326
I'm actually shorthanded.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.028
Oh yeah?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.329
You hiring?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.230
Why?

06:03.263 --> 06:04.598
Are you interested?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.666
Well, I've got to tell you.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.167
It's always been kind
of a dream of mine

06:07.200 --> 06:09.236
to work in a place like this.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.771
I mean I'm big.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.575
So I know how hard it
is to buy big clothes.

06:14.608 --> 06:19.046
I've always wanted to help
the large be better dressed.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.181
Well, then this probably
isn't for you because I'm only

06:21.214 --> 06:23.083
looking for someone till June.
- Perfect.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.518
Because I'd shoot
myself if I had to work

06:24.552 --> 06:27.521
here longer than three months.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.524
I just need some bucks to buy
my wife an anniversary present.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.794
Can you do it on minimum
wage plus 15% commission?

This is great, Jim.
- Hey, Dad.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.334
Look.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.571
I can get this belt
around me three times.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.906
Hey, that's not
very sensitive, Deej.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.176
The person who has to wear that
belt wouldn't appreciate it.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.879
Now go run and put it Back

06:51.912 --> 06:53.113
That's just great.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.281
That's just the
attitude that you

06:54.314 --> 06:55.282
need to work around here, Dan.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.584

it's not in there?

07:12.633 --> 07:13.567
I'm positive.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.469
There is no wedding
ring in here.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.170
Now stop and think.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.640
Have you retraced your
steps for the last two days?

07:19.673 --> 07:20.941

We've just got to
keep looking for it.

But we've got to
get out of here soon

boudoir photo place by three.

Jackie, I can't take
a slutty-looking picture

07:38.759 --> 07:40.561
without my wedding ring.
I'll look cheap.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.333
Rosie, I searched
all through the closet

07:46.366 --> 07:47.668
and I couldn't find it.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.169
Well, it's a wonder you can
find anything in that closet

07:49.202 --> 07:50.738
with all them shoes
cluttering everything up.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.209
Don't worry about it, honey.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.778
You know when you find stuff?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.980
When you stop looking for it.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.015
Now I'm going to sit here
and read this newspaper.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.484
You watch how fast it shows up.

Don't you care that
I lost my wedding ring?

Come on, Roseanne.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.490
I pulled double shifts all week.

I'm exhausted.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.726
Well, fine.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.061
I'm going to go look in
the living room again.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.297
And if I don't find it in
there, I'm getting DJ X-rayed.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.198

Did you try the vacuum bag?

How the hell would it
get into the vacuum bag?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.107
Shh.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.441
I got the ring.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.342
What?
What are you?

08:29.376 --> 08:30.544
Out of your mind?

08:30.578 --> 08:32.312
You're driving her crazy
running around like that.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.581
What do you think you're doing?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.182
Oh, Dan.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.418
That is gorgeous.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.187
I stole it from her when
she was doing the dishes

08:40.220 --> 08:41.088
and took it to a jeweler.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.289
See?

08:42.322 --> 08:43.957
I had him put on that
extra band with a diamond.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.358
Oh.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.594
And those three little garnets
represent each one of the kids.

you guys looking in there.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.734
Get off my back, woman.

So beautiful.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.136
How's you swing that?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.805
Well, I'm paying for
it in installments.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.440
So by our 110th anniversary,
she'll own it out right.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.309
Oh, Dan.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.244
She is going to be
blown away by that.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.946
But you can't let her
keep looking for it.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.114
She's going nuts.
- I know.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.415
But this is the
biggest surprise I ever

09:08.448 --> 09:10.718
tried to pull off in my life.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.385
I can't give it to
her til Saturday.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.055

to start looking in here again.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.126
DAN: Whoa.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.761
Rosie, Jackie, come here.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.662
Quick.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.963
Did you find it?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.632
Yeah, I think I see it
down here in the drain.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.565
Look, Jackie.
- Oh no.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.700
I can see it.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.035
I can see it.

09:28.068 --> 09:32.572
Well, maybe I could see it
if you'd move your big head.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.674
Oh, there it is.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.574
You're right.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.210
That is my ring.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.545
Are you sure?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.414
Dan, I think I would know
if I saw my own wedding ring.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.349
OK?

09:42.382 --> 09:43.917
Take that drain out.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.953
Roseanne, that's a big job.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.855
I don't have the right
kind of tools right now.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.390
Roseanne, I need you to
come with me right away

09:50.423 --> 09:51.825
and talk about
something personal.

09:51.859 --> 09:56.496
And I need to talk about it
somewhere else before three.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.467
Oh yeah.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.368
OK.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.236
Well, you want to talk to me.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.238
So OK.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.740
I'll go get my coat.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.109
[phone rings]

10:11.679 --> 10:12.980
Hello?
Yeah.

10:13.013 --> 10:13.881
Hey, Jim.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.116
How's it going?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.017
Oh man, no.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.151
I can't work Saturday night.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.054
It's my anniversary.

10:21.088 --> 10:21.955
Well, sure.

10:21.989 --> 10:22.856
I want to keep it.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.258
But-- No.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.593
I'll be there.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.494
No.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.395
Don't worry.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.698
My wife will understand.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.200
Just one thing.

10:33.233 --> 10:37.604
Could you swing by in a ski mask
and drag me off at gunpoint?

10:37.637 --> 10:41.441
[music playing]

10:50.350 --> 10:51.151
No.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.322
Next.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.256
JACKIE: Come on.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.190
I got it.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.260
This is-- Dan would love this.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.995
A maid's uniform?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.163
This is supposed to be fantasy.

11:03.196 --> 11:03.997
Not reality.

11:06.033 --> 11:06.900
Don't worry.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.335
I'll find something.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.704
And do you suppose those
things are like bowling shoes?

11:10.738 --> 11:13.173
Do you think they spray
them after every time?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.074
Here.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.977
Try this.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.412
Ooh, that's really pretty.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.580
Ooh.

11:20.613 --> 11:21.681
Hey.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.251
How do I sneak these
out under my clothes?

11:24.284 --> 11:25.786
You don't have to.
They're yours.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.721
Happy anniversary.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.123
Oh, thank you.
Gosh.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.359
How beautiful.

11:32.392 --> 11:37.030
Now I'll look like the kind of
hooker you got to save up for.

11:37.064 --> 11:37.931
OK.

11:37.965 --> 11:38.832
Are we about ready?

11:38.866 --> 11:39.767
Yeah.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.868
She's just getting
all trashed up.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.569
Good.
Good.

11:42.602 --> 11:47.340
So Mrs. Conner, are we going
to be using any props today?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.709
Well, I've got a couple
midgets out in my car.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.745
What do you mean by props?

11:51.779 --> 11:52.645
All right.

11:52.679 --> 11:53.914
Standard bedroom set.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.648
Ho-hum.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.117
Hey, Jackie.
What about you?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.451
I bet you your husband
would love to see

11:58.485 --> 12:01.488
you in something like this?

12:01.521 --> 12:04.024
Oh well, don't
have a husband, Bob.

12:04.057 --> 12:04.925
But thanks for asking.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.826
Oh.

12:05.859 --> 12:06.760
What about your boyfriend?

12:06.794 --> 12:07.660
No.

12:07.694 --> 12:08.929
No boyfriend either.

12:08.962 --> 12:09.763
Cool.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.733
Roseanne, come
on out of there.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.634
Come on.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.903
I want to see what you like.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.404
I don't wanna.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.006
What do you mean
you don't wanna?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.274
Well, this may
not be a good idea.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.542
What if the negatives get out?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.778
I'll never be President.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.779
Roseanne, get out.

12:25.813 --> 12:26.947
Come out here.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.981
No.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.784
I just don't think
this is a good idea.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.585
I should just take
this home, put it on,

12:32.619 --> 12:34.121
then Dan can see
me in it for real.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.255
No.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.525
This way, he gets to see
it whenever he wants.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.526
Trust me, Jackie.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.829
He gets to see it
whenever he wants.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.799
Roseanne, just do it.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.100
- OK.
- Good.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.902
There.
See?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.437
Oh, I'm really proud of you.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.872
You're overcoming your fears.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.773
And this is something you'll
always be glad you did.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.175
Oh yeah.

12:55.208 --> 12:59.646
I've read that old broad in the
cat suit had second thoughts.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.513
OK, Mrs. Conner.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.282
Whenever you're ready.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.583
I can't do it, Jackie.
I can't do it.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.785
No.
Yes, you can do it.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.520
How important is this
anniversary to you?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.455
Very.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.656
And who is the
man you love more

13:09.689 --> 13:10.924
than anybody else in the world?

13:10.958 --> 13:11.758
Tom Jones.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.529
Second?

13:16.563 --> 13:17.430
Dan.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.331
All right.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.234
Let's do it.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.135
OK.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.503
Here's what I want you to do.

13:23.536 --> 13:27.040
I want you to kneel on the bed,
lean toward me a little bit,

13:27.074 --> 13:29.776
kick your back leg
behind, arch your back,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.711
stick out your chest,
and smack your lips.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.921
Perfect.

13:40.954 --> 13:41.889
[flash]

13:41.922 --> 13:46.193
[music playing]

13:49.329 --> 13:50.163
ROSEANNE: Dan?

13:50.197 --> 13:51.664
I'm in here.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.333
Did you get my wedding
ring out of there?

13:53.366 --> 13:56.403
Rosie, honey, I need to
talk to you for a minute.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.804
Oh, so it wasn't in there.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.139
Right?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.408
No.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.176
Listen, I got some bad news.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.777
We're going to have to
celebrate our anniversary

14:04.811 --> 14:06.346
on another night.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.116
I have to work tomorrow.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.083
You gotta work tomorrow?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.523
Oh, I get what you're doing.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.991
You're saying that
you have to work

14:18.025 --> 14:20.793
tomorrow so I'll get all mad
and hate you and everything.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.229
And then right at
the last minute,

14:22.262 --> 14:23.897
you'll do something
really great like throw

14:23.931 --> 14:25.798
me a surprise party or something
so I'll love you again.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.935
Right?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.670
Yes, that's exactly right.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.639
Except without the great
thing and the really nice

14:32.672 --> 14:34.374
I love you part.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.275
What?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.809
So you're really going to work?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.545
I tried everything I
could to get out of it.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.846
I got no choice.
- Well, yeah.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.780
You do.
Quit.

14:40.813 --> 14:41.681
I can't.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.616
I promised I'd be there.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.584
What?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.286
You're keeping a
promise to some guy

14:46.319 --> 14:48.121
that you knew less
than two weeks

14:48.155 --> 14:50.924
and breaking a promise
to your wife of 20 years.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.626
This is a very special
anniversary, Dan.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.728
It's a temporary
job, for God's sake.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.430
Look, you don't
want to say anymore.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.331
Yeah.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.866
I want to say plenty more.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.501
I can't believe that
you're doing this.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.304
I mean, you're the most selfish
man in the entire world.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.538
You don't care about me.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.674
You don't care about
20 years of marriage.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.077
I mean, all you
care about is you.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.112
You think I'm so selfish?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.281
You think I only
care about myself?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.683
You want to know why I can't
quit my stupid little jobs?

15:16.716 --> 15:17.817
Because I had to pay for this.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.790
It's my wedding ring.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.258
Yes, your wedding ring.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.028
Oh baby, are you in deep now.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.397
Come on, you got
something else to say.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.765
Who the hell asked
you to do this?

15:32.799 --> 15:33.833
What?

15:33.866 --> 15:35.202
Well, you wrecked it.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.204
Did I ever once
ask you to change

15:37.237 --> 15:38.538
anything about this ring?
Did I?

15:38.571 --> 15:39.439
Huh?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.840
No.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.243
Well, I hope you're happy now
because you ruined my ring just

15:43.276 --> 15:44.944
like you ruined my anniversary.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.146
Oh.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.114
Oh, man.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.349
You are something else.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.451
I took a job where I got
to spend all day asking

15:51.484 --> 15:53.353
fat men whether they
dress left or dress

15:53.386 --> 15:54.921
right to pay for that ring.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.323
And it means nothing to you.

15:56.356 --> 16:00.160
Oh you only took that job so
that you can go buy that ring

16:00.193 --> 16:02.762
because you knew you were going
to be working on my anniversary

16:02.795 --> 16:05.298
and you needed to get that ring
so I wouldn't be mad at you.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.442
You are insane.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.976
I'll tell you what.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.245
I'm going to go
out tonight and do

16:18.278 --> 16:20.147
exactly what I did the
night before our wedding 20

16:20.180 --> 16:21.148
years ago.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.416
I'll be with my
friends getting drunk.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.517
You weren't with your friends.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.686
You were with your mom.

16:26.719 --> 16:31.658
My mom can drink my friends
under the table any day.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.427
[music playing]

16:36.896 --> 16:39.099
Hey, coach.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.467
Sorry I broke curfew.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.669
But if I get a little sleep,
I'm sure I can play tomorrow.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.405
Dan, I wouldn't go in there.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.674
OK.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.508
Ever?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.879
Not until I give
you a little advice.

16:52.912 --> 16:53.780
Oh, Jackie.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.116
I already took your advice.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.884
You told me not to
get her the shoe rack

16:57.917 --> 16:59.152
or she'd be mad at me.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.255
What a relief that
didn't happen.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.156
Cool down, Dan.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.457
She's really upset.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.359
Did you talk to her?

17:06.393 --> 17:09.396
She asked me if I
knew about the ring.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.697
And you said?

17:10.730 --> 17:11.798
Yeah.

17:11.831 --> 17:12.999
And then?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.734
And then she and I
decided that I should spend

17:14.767 --> 17:18.305
the rest of night on the porch.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.606
So you're locked out?

17:19.639 --> 17:20.840
Yeah.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.741
Good news.

17:21.774 --> 17:22.809
You don't live here.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.811
I was waiting for you, Dan.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.813
I'm trying to help you out.

17:26.846 --> 17:27.747
Oh, please.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.015
Help me out some more.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.318
I'm still breathing.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.453
I didn't ask to get
dragged into this.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.354
No, Jackie.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.255
You never ask.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.789
You just dive right in.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.658
And the best part is
she hates the ring.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.559
I know.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.428
Well, give it to me.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.495
I'm going to take it back.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.431
Maybe they put the
ring back like it was.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.533
And then all you have to
do is pay for the labor.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.434
Good.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.169
Do it.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.003
You gotta look on
the bright side.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.441
If you hadn't given me bad
advice and I hadn't taken it,

17:54.474 --> 18:01.981
the anniversary wasn't wrecked,
and Roseanne wasn't mad at me,

18:02.014 --> 18:05.285
I wouldn't get to spend
the night on the porch.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.054
[music playing]

18:10.523 --> 18:12.125
So what do you think?

18:12.159 --> 18:14.294
I think the shirt
looks great on you.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.228
I came in with this shirt.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.630
I tried on the pants.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.199
I think the pants really
bring out the shirt.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.071
Hey.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.739
What are you doing here?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.475
Well, I wasn't done
yelling at you yet.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.443
You know, I thought of a
few more mean things to say.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.146
So I want to rush down
here before I forget.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.081
Roseanne, I don't need
this kind of insanity

18:35.114 --> 18:38.084
during the Midnight
Madness sale.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.986
Well, I think maybe then
we should take it outside.

18:40.019 --> 18:40.887
I can't.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.689
I'm working.
- OK.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.191
Well then I'll just
start screaming here.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.024
Right behind you.

18:48.060 --> 18:53.966
I'm going to kick your butt
all the way to Yogurt City.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.034
What's this?

18:55.067 --> 18:57.270
Happy anniversary.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.172
I don't believe this.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.373
You've got everything here.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.308
Corn dogs.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.244
You remembered our
wedding dinner.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.179
And--

19:06.213 --> 19:11.918
[radio playing]

19:11.951 --> 19:16.289
Well, you know I'm not very good
at saying I'm sorry because you

19:16.323 --> 19:17.357
know I never am.

19:17.390 --> 19:22.295
But I just think I
went too far this time.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.998
And I just figure, you know,
after 20 years, every man

19:26.032 --> 19:28.468
deserves to hear this.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.736
I was wrong.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.504
And I think after
20 years, every woman

19:31.538 --> 19:32.572
deserves to hear this.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.141
I agree with you.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.778
Well, don't you have
something to give me?

19:38.811 --> 19:39.846
Um.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.713
Come on.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.849
I'll say yes.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.950
Really?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.585
Promise.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.086
All right.

19:47.119 --> 19:50.257
Roseanne, will you
not be mad at me

19:50.290 --> 19:51.658
for giving the ring
to Jackie to have it

19:51.691 --> 19:53.926
put back the way it was before?

19:53.960 --> 19:54.961
What'd you do that for?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.929
I loved that ring.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.964
Damn it, Roseanne.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.566
First you tell me you hate it.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.468
Then you tell me you love it.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.303
And then, and only then,
I produce it from my pocket

20:03.336 --> 20:05.204
and show you that I
got it back from Jackie

20:05.238 --> 20:07.474
before she took it back to
the guy to have it put back.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.446
You may now eat the corn dog.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.285
Now I've got to
give you your present.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.519
But you got to promise
you won't laugh.

20:25.992 --> 20:26.793
Oooh.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.633
Gadzooks.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.701
Why, Miss Conner.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.635
I can't marry you.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.571
I've fallen in
love with another.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.907
You don't think it's stupid?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.442
You're beautiful, honey.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.410
Well, hell.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.944
I always thought
you were beautiful.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.313
You really like it?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.114
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.916
Cause I made you an appointment
over there next week.

20:49.949 --> 20:54.621
So might as well
start shaving now.

20:54.654 --> 21:01.193
