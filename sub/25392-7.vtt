00:44.378 --> 00:46.964
Wake up, Carl. Wake up!

01:13.031 --> 01:14.783
Carl?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.869
What happened?

01:19.997 --> 01:21.248
Carl!

02:50.462 --> 02:52.547
Easy. Easy, now.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.049
Take it easy.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.889
- How long was I out?
- About an hour.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.851
Where's Piranha?

03:05.644 --> 03:08.146
Now, you just go slow, son.
Go slow.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.314
Where is he, Dad?

03:09.940 --> 03:13.068
- I don't know. I thought he's with you.
- What?

03:13.151 --> 03:16.446
You need to get that bass out
of your voice. You know you ain't grown.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.115
Look, I don't have time to be polite.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.909
This is a life or death situation.
Now, where is he?

03:20.992 --> 03:23.787
Well, he left about a half hour
after you did.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.582
Said something about chartering a jet
at Teterboro and calling his mama.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.876
He tried to call you,
but you didn't pick up.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.170
You had one job.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.673
I serve the Lord.

03:35.757 --> 03:40.595
God bestows on us free will.
Greatest gift he's given.

03:40.679 --> 03:45.517
Now, your friend decided to use that
when he walked out of that door.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.228
What use are you, man?

03:49.688 --> 03:53.191
I did the best I could.
He wouldn't listen.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.026
He was hardheaded.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.572
- I have to go find him.
- You need to rest.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.240
- I'm calling a doctor.
- No.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.897
Takes a while to get your shot back,
but you'll get there.

04:31.980 --> 04:36.276
Captain, I'm done, all right?
Just leave me be.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.363
So, what're you gonna do?
Audition for the New York Liberty?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.323
Yeah, maybe.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.451
I need you back on the job,
doing what you do.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.495
I'm surprised.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.666
I thought May May had you too wrapped
around her finger to do anything about it.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.295
Yeah, I stuck around
in the observation room long enough.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.590
Chang pulled me
before you two started making out.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.300
She's important to me.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.679
But the law is the law,
and I swear by it no matter what.

05:04.763 --> 05:09.226
I am working a CI, off the books,
at Harlem's Paradise.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.977
Off the books?

05:11.770 --> 05:14.815
And you were all on my ass
about freelancing.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.776
It's delicate.
And I didn't want politics to derail this.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.321
We do this right,
Mariah is out of the game for good.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.950
- Who's your snitch?
- I can't tell you that, not yet.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.285
- Captain.
- We are this close.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.789
But I have one factor
that I can't control.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.207
Luke Cage.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.961
You know, he's an ally. Not a liability.

05:36.044 --> 05:40.257
If Piranha Jones is so important
to both the Jamaicans and Mariah's goons,

05:40.340 --> 05:41.591
he must know something.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.263
I need Luke to hand him over
safely, pronto.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.431
I don't control Luke.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.976
Luke's been spotted near a church, alone.

05:52.102 --> 05:56.189
I could try to haul him in.
But we both know the handcuffs won't hold.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.484
I'm sorry, Captain, but I can't.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.530
Look, I'm done. And I'm at peace with it.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.412
You know where to find me.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.670
<i>Where is Piranha?</i>

06:19.504 --> 06:21.423
Does Luke Cage still have him?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.092
Does Bushmaster?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.678
God damn it,
it's not even about the money.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.681
I have known Raymond
since he was in grade school.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.766
He is loyal.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.768
We're searching everywhere.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.981
Somebody has been running
their goddamn mouth.

06:40.108 --> 06:44.529
I hate nothing more
than a dirty-ass snitch.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.865
I'm with Ridenhour,

06:46.948 --> 06:49.951
I should be talking about heads on pikes,

06:50.535 --> 06:54.122
crying my eyes out, being the victim.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.585
He talking to me
about Tone getting thrown off the roof

06:58.668 --> 07:01.254
and some shit that he's not even
supposed to know about.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.595
Relationships are the only thing
that matter.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.265
I put a premium on loyalty.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.561
My grandmother thrived by it.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.648
You know what else she taught me?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.778
Pressure reveals the truth.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.030
When in doubt...

07:30.951 --> 07:32.118
Hush.

07:33.578 --> 07:37.540
I am loyal to my family. Period.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.794
Y'all got to decide
whether you are still in my family.

07:42.003 --> 07:45.215
Find Piranha. Now!

07:46.132 --> 07:50.220
What are you waiting for?!
Time is precious!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.484
I'm done talking, Hernan.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.945
Then listen.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.991
Fear doesn't always inspire.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.494
It alienates.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.125
Be better than Mama Mabel.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.294
Be better than Cornell.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.674
Otherwise, you're always gonna be
looking over your shoulder.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.316
Get our money.

08:48.153 --> 08:52.699
Oh, I'm gonna get our money, baby.
Don't you worry.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.286
I'm gonna bring Piranha home.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.540
I'm gonna smack the shit
out of some Rastas.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.045
And then everything gonna be irie.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.757
You want me to tell her you're here?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.342
In a minute.

10:57.282 --> 11:01.161
I found this in one of those
old donation boxes.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.121
It's a hoodie.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.833
That's kinda,
like, your thing, right?

11:08.126 --> 11:10.753
Yeah. I got some back at the barbershop.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.132
I think you should stay.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.887
Nah, I think it's best
if I keep it moving.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.557
Boy, I am trying the best I can.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.729
I worry. I'm still your father.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.148
Define "father."

11:31.024 --> 11:32.317
Boy, do not...

11:40.700 --> 11:46.039
What? You think you can intimidate me?
Just 'cause you're all swole?

11:46.873 --> 11:52.295
No, you're still the same angry little boy
except you've got muscles.

11:53.129 --> 11:58.885
And you still have the nerve to talk to me
about truth and integrity.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.138
You're a goddamn hypocrite.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.766
You will honor thy father
in the house of the Lord.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.850
Wow.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.187
Now you wanna talk to me
about honor? Really?

12:09.270 --> 12:15.109
Boy, I don't care how bulletproof you are.
I will break my foot off in your ass.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.282
I'd love to see you try.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.960
Streets is calling. I'm out.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.714
They always calling.
You don't have to always answer.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.177
There's the father I know.

12:47.475 --> 12:51.688
You like water,
my friend? Hmm?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.648
You swim?

12:54.399 --> 12:58.194
Water's nice, but I don't love it, though.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.488
Your name, though.

13:01.531 --> 13:05.910
It implies you like sea life. Fishes.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.663
I just dug the image, you know.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.125
Killer fish you don't see coming?

13:14.544 --> 13:18.506
I thought it was better to be a whale
in your business, you know?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.677
I need information.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.722
Passwords.

13:27.932 --> 13:32.020
Everything that belongs to Mariah Stokes
should be mine.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.192
After you do what you do,

13:40.361 --> 13:41.612
it will be.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.036
I can't do that, brother.
I mean, I can't.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.705
I still have my professional integrity.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.789
You can.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.126
Whatever y'all got going
against Mariah Dillard...

13:55.209 --> 13:59.589
Mariah Stokes. Mariah... Stokes.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.551
Whatever. I ain't in it. Okay?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.681
You can make this right.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.642
Right as rain. Hmm?

14:16.147 --> 14:18.274
Yeah.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.153
You know Luke Cage is coming
for me, right?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.573
I don't think so.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.160
You can't kill Luke Cage.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.123
Nobody can kill Luke Cage.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.418
Type faster, man.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.965
I will be happy
when that woman is locked in a box.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.220
- With bars or mahogany handles?
- Doesn't matter which to me.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.347
Yes, it does.

14:50.556 --> 14:55.061
- I need Piranha.
- We all do. He's key to everything.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.979
Piranha gave up Mariah?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.190
Hook, line, and sinker.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.859
Piranha has control
of everything Mariah owns.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.986
He's a walking, talking stash house.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.156
He has access to all her money
and her property?

15:08.324 --> 15:12.495
Everything. She gave him power of attorney
to close her shady stock deal.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.040
Whoever gets those keys
get the throne back.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.418
And Bushmaster wants to be king.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.214
- Where'd you last see Piranha?
- The church. A few hours ago.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.136
- He's not there anymore.
- Hmm. So he ditched your dad?

15:28.219 --> 15:30.054
Hey. What?

15:31.222 --> 15:33.558
Another Lucas
with pointed sermons about you?

15:33.641 --> 15:37.186
Come on, Ray Charles
could have seen that coming.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.901
Bushmaster may have Piranha.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.446
If he dies, it's on me.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.532
No, it's not.
Look, Piranha knew what he was doing.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.284
He took the money. He knew the risk.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.328
Candace took the money,
and she helped frame me.

15:55.705 --> 16:00.001
But she also came around.
She deserved better than she got.

16:01.294 --> 16:05.006
Just because people do the wrong thing
doesn't mean they don't need our help.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.260
- We're running out of time.
- Yeah, who you telling?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.555
Those cabs the Stylers were driving...

16:12.638 --> 16:15.683
I caught a partial plate.
Traced it to a place in Brooklyn.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.478
So why not call it in?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.736
You're off the reservation again,
aren't you?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.988
Listen, we do this right, it won't matter.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.449
You know I've got your back, right?

16:32.658 --> 16:36.454
But just so we're clear,
when we're out there, what I say goes.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.416
I'm not in the market
for a, uh... sidekick.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.628
Who says you're not my sidekick?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.965
Me. It's my show.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.521
Remember, these dudes have Hammer weapons.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.856
What, are you about to tell me
to wait in the car?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.107
I didn't say all that.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.401
What, you think I can't with this arm?

17:08.152 --> 17:12.240
- You got nothing to prove to me, okay?
- But I have something to prove to me.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.038
Hey, we got a few questions for you.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.750
Come on, man, don't...

18:14.802 --> 18:15.803
Wow.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.514
You're making me rethink
this whole sidekick thing.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.775
Give me that.

18:38.826 --> 18:39.827
Oh, no!

18:40.369 --> 18:41.829
You broke my nose!

18:41.912 --> 18:43.039
Ah!

18:54.425 --> 18:57.428
So, uh, where's Piranha?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.981
Something does not feel right.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.656
You hear that?

19:53.651 --> 19:54.777
Shit.

20:24.098 --> 20:28.853
Cornell used to do that...
almost every time he came in.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.944
Are you done running?

20:40.948 --> 20:44.910
I never answered your call
because I needed time.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.789
- Mommy, I never asked for any of this.
- Do you think I did?

20:48.873 --> 20:50.249
That's just it.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.627
You don't need any of this mess.
None of it.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.172
Just get up, walk away.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.300
I used to say the same thing to Cornell.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.094
But he was right.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.347
It's not that simple.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.352
The Stokes family built greatness
out of nothing.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.230
Nobody pushes us off that.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.816
But that is why you became a Dillard.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.528
Daddy gave you the chance
to escape that legacy.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.615
You don't know all about your father.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.868
I know I'm smart like him.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.871
I have a feeling for healing people.

21:29.538 --> 21:33.918
And not just with medicine, but by using
the earth the way it was intended.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.211
That's my daddy.

21:35.294 --> 21:39.006
The Dillard name represented a choice.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.258
It was a new start.

21:42.301 --> 21:48.474
But don't think for a minute I didn't love
my grandmother and the family.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.560
Mama Mabel was hard.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.230
She got me ready for this world.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.899
Come here, let me show you something.

22:01.779 --> 22:02.780
Sit.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.707
No way.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.585
It's that much?

22:18.003 --> 22:23.008
Every sacrifice Mama Mabel
and Cornell made was for me.

22:25.135 --> 22:30.558
That someday, I would have something
that I could pass on to you.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.061
And you could pass on to yours.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.608
It redeems all of this.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.404
Redeems me.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.537
- Jesus.
- Tell me about it.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.338
Thought you were done.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.173
You got in my head.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.594
But I had to do things my way,
on my own terms.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.012
That worked out well.

23:09.430 --> 23:13.475
Look, this has Bushmaster written
all over it. The flair for the dramatic.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.936
But no real proof. This doesn't help me.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.147
Proof is an instinct.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.150
He's going after Mariah.
I have no doubt about it.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.902
So, with Piranha dead, you think
Bushmaster got what he wanted?

23:23.986 --> 23:25.571
It sure as hell looks that way.

23:25.654 --> 23:29.366
If your theory's right, Mariah will have
lost the club and the money.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.451
Everything.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.329
This gives me the perfect opportunity,
and leverage,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.873
especially with what my CI
has already given me.

23:35.956 --> 23:36.957
"Leverage"?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.210
Wait. Are you looking
to cut a deal with Mariah?

23:40.294 --> 23:43.297
All I am looking to do is to stop
the bloodshed and save some lives.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.800
Your old prom date
is a stone-cold murderer.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.510
She doesn't get a pass.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.597
- Do not negotiate with her.
- I know what I'm doing.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.723
No, you don't!

23:52.806 --> 23:57.227
This from a woman who was planting
a bullet to frame Cockroach yesterday,

23:57.311 --> 24:00.230
and who turned me down
when I came to her today for help.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.275
You're right.
I was afraid of becoming Scarfe.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.903
But what's worse is becoming you.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.031
Compromised and corrupt.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.993
You don't have the seniority or the balls
to ever question my commitment.

24:13.077 --> 24:16.246
You know what? I don't have the seniority.
And I don't have balls.

24:16.330 --> 24:20.918
But I can question your smarts
as much as I damn well please,

24:21.001 --> 24:22.711
'cause I'm not a cop anymore.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.265
He wants to cut a deal with Mariah.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.726
I thought at least he had a soul.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.230
Hard to have a soul when you're dealing
with somebody like Mariah.

24:41.689 --> 24:47.319
Look, you lost Piranha. I lost Candace.
You can't save them all.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.114
Yeah? Says who?

24:51.365 --> 24:56.078
I appreciate the call, Misty,
but you and Cage need to go.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.038
It's protocol.

24:58.747 --> 25:01.417
Bailey, dudes are getting
murdered by fish.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.836
I think we are way past protocol
at this point.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.588
Both of y'all think the rules don't apply.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.925
Poor Piranha was used as bait
to lure a bigger fish.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.094
Hope it was worth it, hero.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.388
Nandi, you need to sit your ass down.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.557
Why don't you go audition
for <i> The Voice </i> or some shit

25:16.640 --> 25:19.727
'cause this cop work
isn't really working out for you.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.396
Keep talking shit,
and I'll be singing at your funeral.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.441
- Bitch, please.
- Enough, okay? Enough.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.817
We lost.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.820
No one's way was better.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.116
And no, Nandi, it wasn't worth it.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.835
Piranha's mama's still here
somewhere in Harlem.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.462
Only family he's got left.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.757
Family is a good thing.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.010
It can be.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.598
I'll, um... catch you later.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.320
In a fish tank?

26:15.657 --> 26:20.037
By the time we process the evidence
that we found at the crime scene

26:20.120 --> 26:21.914
and from Piranha's home and office,

26:21.997 --> 26:24.750
I'm pretty sure we're gonna find
evidence of insider trading

26:24.833 --> 26:27.503
when it comes to
the Atreus Plastics merger.

26:29.213 --> 26:32.382
So, fine. The SEC spanks you.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.718
It's your first offense.

26:35.469 --> 26:39.515
With Ben Donovan as your lawyer,
and you promise to return the money,

26:40.474 --> 26:42.309
that's Martha Stewart shit.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.522
But when we dig deeper
into how you got the millions to invest,

26:46.605 --> 26:48.065
that's when it gets fun.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.652
If we have evidence to prove
that you were part of a larger conspiracy,

26:52.277 --> 26:53.987
that's El Chapo shit.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.366
But if you cut a deal with me,

26:57.991 --> 27:00.869
and say that you were coerced
into running something

27:00.953 --> 27:05.749
by your late cousin
and his henchman Hernan Alvarez,

27:05.833 --> 27:07.668
that you got in over your head,

27:08.710 --> 27:10.712
the public will stand behind you.

27:11.797 --> 27:16.635
You walk, you connect Mr. Alvarez
with this whole Bushmaster thing,

27:16.718 --> 27:18.846
they'll both end up in custody,

27:19.763 --> 27:23.392
and you still have some salt
left over in the political arena.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.519
That's Marion Barry shit.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.022
The decision's yours.

27:29.106 --> 27:33.277
How do you want to live your life?
On the run from Bushmaster?

27:33.360 --> 27:34.778
Or on the run from us?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.619
Bye, Tommy.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.040
And I did mean it.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.794
It was good to see you.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.340
I still care about you, May.
I always will.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.009
I don't want to see you hurt.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.553
Even after what you've become.

28:00.971 --> 28:01.972
Get out.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.725
Don't go out like him. Like Cornell.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.437
Save yourself, Mariah. And Tilda.

28:11.273 --> 28:17.154
What do you know about
what she needs, what my family needs?

28:17.237 --> 28:20.282
I know that you almost died
when you gave birth to her.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.869
- Shut up.
- Does she even know her real age?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.454
I said shut up.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.832
- Does she know who her real daddy is?
- Shut the hell up!

28:30.375 --> 28:31.585
We're done!

28:37.758 --> 28:40.052
Tommy. Wait.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.388
Just let me think.

28:47.684 --> 28:52.856
But if you really care about me,
Tilda cannot know.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.199
You have till the morning.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.517
Oh!

29:29.685 --> 29:30.894
Madam Councilwoman.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.437
He took it.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.982
Bushmaster took it all!

29:35.065 --> 29:37.317
We're not safe.
We have to get out of here.

29:38.694 --> 29:39.820
Get Tilda.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.823
Go to the brownstone. I've got money
in the safe. We'll take a jet.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.074
- I'm on it.
- Go! Go!

29:49.246 --> 29:51.498
The gun connect was yours to begin with.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.043
Plus all that work you put in
with Cottonmouth and Diamondback.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.796
You the king,
and she treating you like a jump-off.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.214
She doesn't see me like that.

29:59.298 --> 30:03.176
She's only loyal to family.
And you ain't family.

30:04.886 --> 30:08.015
Piranha's not even the most important
thing in front of us right now.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.808
We gotta find that snitch.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.894
That's easy. It's Sugar.

30:13.979 --> 30:14.980
Sugar?

30:16.189 --> 30:17.524
He left and he came back.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.111
Sometimes, being a father changes people.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.157
- How long you been eyeing him?
- A while.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.118
Look, I don't trust him, all right?

30:28.201 --> 30:30.412
He's one of those
big, sensitive emo niggas.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.497
All right?
He probably cries watching <i>This Is Us.</i>

30:34.124 --> 30:35.709
I cry watching <i>This Is Us.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:47.929
I'll talk to him.

30:48.722 --> 30:52.559
Or I could use a letter opener
on that Mariah/Nino Brown shit.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.229
Unless you want to handle it personally.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.025
No. You got it.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.486
I trust you.

31:08.116 --> 31:12.621
Shit. Piranha's dead.
Mariah's bugging out.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.248
I gotta secure the club.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.209
- Look, I'll come with you.
- No.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.587
You stay on Sugar.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.637
We good?

31:30.347 --> 31:31.723
Absolutely.

31:44.861 --> 31:45.862
What's wrong, Uncle?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.116
You're mad because I bought another suit?

31:52.494 --> 31:55.038
A Styler must style, you know?

31:56.289 --> 31:57.290
Yeah.

31:58.041 --> 32:04.297
This... hatred for the Stokes,
it consumes you.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.424
Mmm.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.217
You have to let it go.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.386
What would Gwen think?

32:14.474 --> 32:18.728
You remember how mad my mother would get
when I would get my school clothes dirty?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.816
I hated wearing the ties.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.776
And the shoes... Ugh!

32:25.944 --> 32:28.447
But she insisted I look respectable.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.116
She told me that being clean
was an attitude

32:31.199 --> 32:33.869
that had nothing to do
with money or your job.

32:34.703 --> 32:40.083
Because she cooked and she cleaned,
but she walked down the road like a queen.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.710
Mmm.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.879
It's how you carry yourself inside.

32:45.005 --> 32:49.342
Yeah. She would talk about my father,
how proud he was.

32:50.135 --> 32:56.558
And I'd come home, shirt ripped,
knuckles bloodied, tie loose, one shoe,

32:57.517 --> 32:59.478
because I had to defend my name.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.731
She never said a word.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.693
But I knew I was in trouble.

33:07.944 --> 33:12.199
I see that frown on her face,
there would be no supper,

33:13.909 --> 33:18.371
but her eyes... her eyes always smiled.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.583
She couldn't hide her pride.

33:22.292 --> 33:28.089
Because she knew
that I was fighter, a warrior...

33:30.884 --> 33:32.385
I'd always be free.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.474
A McIver like my father.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.103
Never a puppet or a slave.

33:45.023 --> 33:50.445
So I won't let go...
until we get everything that belong to us.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.240
And nothing less.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.993
You've got all the money
you could ever need,

33:57.786 --> 33:59.496
respect from your people,

34:00.830 --> 34:06.044
while the cops are tearing the city apart,
harassing hardworking Jamaicans.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.088
And for what?

34:09.589 --> 34:11.216
What is it you really want?

34:13.842 --> 34:15.178
Mariah's soul.

34:16.679 --> 34:17.973
For my mother's.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.893
Life has taught me this.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.232
You can't drown sorrow with tears.

34:31.485 --> 34:35.574
If you want to erase sorrow,
you must burn it.

34:43.665 --> 34:48.837
My question is why don't you
have more fury? More anger?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.091
Because you can't bring Gwen back.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.262
Vengeance belong to the Lord.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.724
Hmm. Well, the Lord can have it back
when I'm done with it.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.440
It's time.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.330
You used to do the same thing
when you were little.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.665
Just stare at me.

35:27.792 --> 35:32.213
I saw about your friend on the news.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.133
I'm sorry, son.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.385
So am I.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.230
I saw Mama today.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.697
After Bushmaster pushed me
off of that bridge

35:57.781 --> 35:59.866
and he paralyzed me with something...

36:03.161 --> 36:04.746
everything went dark.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.208
Then I just sort of...

36:10.210 --> 36:11.628
I just let go.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.967
I saw my life before my eyes.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.471
I saw her.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.933
<i>Her hands.</i>

36:28.019 --> 36:30.188
You remember the last time
you saw me at Seagate?

36:31.731 --> 36:33.441
When I told you I was innocent?

36:33.525 --> 36:37.070
- Daddy! I swear to God!
- You leave God out of this!

36:38.154 --> 36:41.324
But she, sick as she was,

36:42.701 --> 36:45.203
she never gave up on me.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.127
I haven't been to church
in a long time.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.170
I don't pray much, either.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.966
But today, in that river,

36:59.384 --> 37:02.011
I think God was trying
to tell me something.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.305
What?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.810
The world may be my problem...

37:11.062 --> 37:13.440
but it's not always my fault.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.160
- He knows.
- All right, look...

38:07.243 --> 38:08.828
- He knows!
- Calm down.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.375
He admitted to me that
he saw Mariah kill Cottonmouth.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.837
That's murder.
She goes away for life, right?

38:17.921 --> 38:20.089
Look, I told you I'd protect you.
And I meant it.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.800
Just stay in it a little longer.

38:21.883 --> 38:24.969
No, God damn it! I'm out.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.724
Did somebody follow you here?

38:32.769 --> 38:36.606
Hold up. Just hold on a second.

38:36.689 --> 38:40.318
I got him, bro. Sugar's old lady
told me who he was snitching to.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.780
I caught him first.
I'mma take care of Sugar next.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.573
You don't have to do this.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.992
Darius, I can cut you both a deal.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.370
Your name is Hernan, right?

38:51.913 --> 38:53.498
He told me what you saw. Cottonmouth.

38:53.581 --> 38:57.418
You testify against Mariah,
I'll make sure you get the same deal.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.922
Immunity, time served.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.852
Darius?

39:16.604 --> 39:19.691
They probably got crime boards up
and shit, man. Like the movies.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.527
You know how Sugar
used to run his damn mouth.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.946
You run my alias, you get a phone book.
Same as you.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.201
We shot a cop.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.000
How we gonna play this?

39:39.586 --> 39:44.632
No cameras. That's good. It's late.
There's no one around.

39:45.592 --> 39:46.926
We can work with this.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.970
Right.

39:49.053 --> 39:55.560
This dirty-ass cop got to Sugar,
and then he tried to flip you

39:55.643 --> 39:57.478
by threatening to send you back to jail.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.857
- But you wouldn't play ball.
- Never.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.400
Shit got heated,

40:04.319 --> 40:06.404
and he pulled his gun.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.783
You killed him.

40:12.035 --> 40:15.330
It was self-defense. Plain and simple.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.123
Word. Exactly.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.541
You shot him first.

40:20.919 --> 40:25.006
And then with his dying breath,
he raised his gun and...

40:33.932 --> 40:35.391
He died first...

40:38.102 --> 40:40.104
and you bled out later.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.780
I was gonna get us both out.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.866
Like he said.

40:52.742 --> 40:53.910
I didn't want out.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.747
It was gonna be different this time.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.126
I know.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.424
You remember that time? Coney Island?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.260
When we stole them hot dogs.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.975
Almost got away with it, too.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.268
Your mama beat your ass.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.315
Why didn't you tell her it was my idea?

41:27.443 --> 41:30.655
You my nigga. Always.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.615
Always.

41:38.121 --> 41:43.209
Because I love you...
I was blinded by that shit.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.422
I didn't see the snitch in you.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.433
What the hell does that say about me?

42:42.060 --> 42:44.771
- What are you doing?
- Get back from the window.

42:44.854 --> 42:46.689
Okay, Mommy. Slow down.

42:46.773 --> 42:49.150
Not now, T. Everybody in place?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.277
One out front, one out back,
two circling the block.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.946
- Where's Shades?
- He's taking care of something.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.783
- Sure you don't want me to stay?
- No. You get out of here.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.659
It's not your side of things.

43:02.497 --> 43:06.084
What the hell is that? Mom, you have
the money. What do you need a gun for?

43:06.167 --> 43:07.585
A woman always needs a gun.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.295
The man leaves heads on pikes.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.756
Do you really think
he's gonna be swayed by this gun?

43:17.345 --> 43:21.224
Your kid is right.
Your little gun won't persuade me.

43:21.307 --> 43:22.183
Hey!

43:26.145 --> 43:30.358
Hey, I should have recognized you
for a Stokes when I saw you.

43:30.983 --> 43:32.860
I almost feel sorry for you.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.034
Were you in the war?

43:41.327 --> 43:42.829
Something like that.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.999
A fighter. And a lover?

43:48.501 --> 43:52.839
Depends on the cause.
And it depends on the person.

43:54.006 --> 43:55.424
Who fights for you?

43:56.843 --> 43:58.845
Sweetheart, I can take care of myself.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.068
You need to get that?

44:18.072 --> 44:21.701
No. I'm not on the job anymore.

44:32.628 --> 44:35.631
Bailey, the world better be on fire.

44:48.811 --> 44:52.857
Hey! Where you going?

44:54.108 --> 44:59.614
I played this in my head over and over.

45:01.032 --> 45:04.285
And somehow, this is sweeter.

45:05.161 --> 45:10.333
You and me, son,
we can't move forward if we can't forgive.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.794
I don't think I can, Dad.

45:14.837 --> 45:16.047
Two dishwashers.

45:17.256 --> 45:20.551
One Jamaican, the other American.

45:20.635 --> 45:25.723
Like brothers...
they built their empire together.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.769
Bushmaster's Rum, Harlem's Paradise.

45:29.852 --> 45:34.899
Until the Italian gangsters
and the Irish cops and the politicians

45:34.982 --> 45:36.484
come for their company.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.111
But my father didn't want to sell.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.907
He's Jamaican. We resist.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.242
But Buggy Stokes,

45:45.326 --> 45:49.497
he caved when they told him
that he could keep the bar

45:49.580 --> 45:54.335
and make a little profit off the rum
if he got rid of my father.

45:55.795 --> 45:57.421
So he killed my father.

45:57.505 --> 45:59.924
You blamed me for Mama.

46:00.007 --> 46:02.802
I was angry, son, when that cancer struck.

46:02.885 --> 46:07.598
You did this. Seeing you locked up
in here is what's making her sick.

46:08.641 --> 46:13.229
But not before my father
shot him back in his belly.

46:14.814 --> 46:18.025
It took Buggy Stokes five months to die.

46:19.527 --> 46:23.447
My mother escaped to Kingston with me.
And it wasn't a problem.

46:24.073 --> 46:25.783
We had our own life.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.414
Until they found us.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.461
I remember the bottle
flying through the window.

46:38.421 --> 46:41.257
- A Bushmaster bottle...
- It's not true.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.968
filled with gas and a lit cloth inside.

46:44.969 --> 46:45.803
Yeah.

46:46.846 --> 46:50.599
When it landed,
the flames went everywhere.

46:50.683 --> 46:53.060
The fire moved so fast.

46:53.144 --> 46:56.188
My mother put me outside the window
and she told me,

46:57.398 --> 46:59.483
she yelled, "Run!"

47:02.445 --> 47:03.738
So I did.

47:09.118 --> 47:10.703
I never saw her again.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.413
Come on, let's go.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.042
Come on.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.671
That's the last time that I saw her.

47:24.300 --> 47:27.928
I hold that image so I won't forget.

47:29.972 --> 47:34.977
I was wrong in blaming you
for your mama's dying.

47:38.355 --> 47:41.942
I'm so, so sorry, son.

47:44.111 --> 47:45.362
I know.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.493
But then
I remember Willis.

47:50.576 --> 47:51.869
Hmm.

47:51.952 --> 47:53.120
And his mother.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.416
I was innocent.

47:58.918 --> 48:00.336
You were the guilty one.

48:02.004 --> 48:03.964
Do you know what I was robbed of?

48:04.757 --> 48:06.300
All because of your lies?

48:08.928 --> 48:11.722
No, no! No, please! Please!

48:13.432 --> 48:17.144
You don't have to do this. Don't.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.785
The door is open.

48:33.911 --> 48:37.331
Let's see if you're a better daughter
than I was a son.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.716
You die, McIver!

48:47.800 --> 48:54.223
Die, McIver! You die, McIver! Oh! You die!

49:06.152 --> 49:09.530
Glad I caught you, B.
Mariah's brownstone's on fire, yo.

49:10.281 --> 49:11.282
What?

49:12.116 --> 49:13.325
Smoke and everything.

49:13.409 --> 49:15.995
I wonder if them Jamaican cats found her
or some shit.

49:16.078 --> 49:17.663
- Stay here.
- No, wait, Carl. Wait.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.290
- I'll be back.
- Carl!

53:25.327 --> 53:26.245
Luke.

53:28.997 --> 53:30.290
You helped me.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.337
I wanna hire you.
