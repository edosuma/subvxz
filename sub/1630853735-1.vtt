WEBVTT

00:37.416 --> 00:39.375
I almost got married once.

00:52.833 --> 00:55.375
Wentworth held my heart.

01:10.666 --> 01:14.750
But he was a sailor
without rank or fortune.

01:16.666 --> 01:19.041
And I was persuaded to give him up.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.541
Now I'm single and thriving.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.750
I spend my time drinking fine wines,

01:40.166 --> 01:42.375
enjoying warm baths…

01:44.625 --> 01:46.833
and lying face down on my bed.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.708
Like I said, thriving.

01:54.083 --> 01:55.375
Who needs romance

01:55.458 --> 01:58.416
when one has… family?

02:16.041 --> 02:17.041
My father.

02:17.875 --> 02:20.833
He's never met a reflective surface
he didn't like.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.958
Vanity is the beginning and end
of his character.

02:26.083 --> 02:27.083
Also the middle.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.958
"Sir Walter Elliot,

02:29.041 --> 02:31.375
born March 1st, 1760."

02:31.458 --> 02:32.875
"Man of consequence,

02:32.958 --> 02:35.666
known for his exquisite jawline."

02:38.833 --> 02:43.458
He is the sole object
of his own warmest respect and devotion.

02:45.500 --> 02:49.416
One's family is only escapable
by two things,

02:49.500 --> 02:51.583
marriage and death.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.291
Both seem unlikely
in the immediate future.

02:56.375 --> 02:59.333
"Married July 15th, 1784, to Jane."

02:59.416 --> 03:00.250
My mother.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.166
-I miss her.
-"Jane died in 1801."

03:05.250 --> 03:08.375
"By her, Sir Walter issued
three children."

03:08.958 --> 03:09.833
My sisters.

03:10.541 --> 03:12.833
"Elizabeth, celebrated beauty

03:12.916 --> 03:16.250
and Somerset's
most fashion-forward luminary."

03:16.833 --> 03:19.416
Elizabeth, the eldest.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.666
"Mary,
married to Charles Musgrove,

03:21.750 --> 03:25.083
heir to the superior Uppercross estate."

03:25.166 --> 03:26.958
Mary, the youngest.

03:27.041 --> 03:30.208
"And Anne, born August 9th, 1787."

03:35.125 --> 03:37.458
And me, middle child,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.916
the crack in his looking glass.

03:40.583 --> 03:44.000
Shame there wasn't anything nice
we could think to add about you, Anne.

03:44.666 --> 03:45.833
Thanks for trying.

03:45.916 --> 03:48.333
You're welcome.
I wanted to leave you out entirely,

03:48.416 --> 03:50.708
but Daddy thought
people might think you had died.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.708
-Debt collectors.
-Daddy. Daddy!

03:58.000 --> 04:01.750
The one thing my father loves more
than himself is spending money.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.250
It was always going to run out one day.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.583
-Daddy…
-Daddy's broke, princess.

04:07.666 --> 04:09.000
Playtime's over.

04:11.416 --> 04:12.250
Oh!

04:16.791 --> 04:18.541
There, there, Sir Walter.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.333
Lots of people face debt
at some point in their lives.

04:22.416 --> 04:23.916
You must retrench.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.958
You have no choice.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.458
I've drawn up a vigorous plan of economy.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.750
The most necessary reductions
are underlined.

04:29.833 --> 04:33.833
Meet my mother's best friend
and unflinching speaker of truth.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.833
Lady Russell took it on herself

04:35.916 --> 04:38.958
to give me advice on every topic
as she felt my mother would have.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.791
Always insightful and helpful.

04:44.625 --> 04:48.875
With one… notable exception.

04:49.791 --> 04:55.208
Some people don't have homes or food.
Try to put this into perspective.

04:55.791 --> 04:56.625
Mr. Shepherd,

04:56.708 --> 05:00.041
if I was interested in gaining perspective
by thinking of the poor,

05:00.541 --> 05:02.500
I'd ask you the rate
charged by your barber.

05:03.833 --> 05:06.291
Don't ask me to change things
by seeing them differently.

05:06.791 --> 05:09.958
See things my way,
then change them until they are different.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.458
Perhaps we need only stop
giving to charities.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.041
Do we do that?

05:16.166 --> 05:17.333
Jane would be ashamed.

05:18.166 --> 05:22.458
She begged me to protect her daughters
from their father's excessive excesses

05:22.541 --> 05:23.666
and I have failed.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.291
Your arrogance will bankrupt them all.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.208
Father,

05:28.625 --> 05:30.291
true reputation comes

05:30.375 --> 05:34.708
from honesty, integrity, compassion,

05:34.791 --> 05:37.500
acceptance of responsibility
for the welfare of others.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.291
Anne, we're speaking
of something substantial.

05:40.958 --> 05:41.791
Try to keep up.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.833
Why not downsize
and move somewhere cheaper?

05:46.666 --> 05:48.541
Bath is lovely.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.875
And the spas there
will work wonders for your skin.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.541
And what of Kellynch Hall?

05:53.625 --> 05:56.125
Just the other day
I met a wealthy naval officer

05:56.208 --> 05:58.958
who would pay a handsome rent
for a house like Kellynch.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.541
I will not have a Navy man in my house.

06:03.416 --> 06:06.541
-They're all ugly.
-Admiral Croft is quite handsome.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.458
Admiral? What right has the British Navy

06:09.541 --> 06:12.916
to bring persons of obscure birth
into undue distinction?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.583
Only God has the right to bestow rank.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.958
What good is a title
if you have to earn it?

06:18.041 --> 06:20.250
What good is anything
if you have to earn it?

06:20.833 --> 06:23.208
Admiral Croft is a fine gentleman.

06:24.458 --> 06:28.833
His wife told me about a brother
who lived among us a few years back.

06:28.916 --> 06:31.166
He was also a naval officer.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.875
What was his name? Uh, Wellington?

06:33.958 --> 06:35.708
Weathers? Winslow?

06:35.791 --> 06:36.916
You mean Wentworth?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.333
-Wentworth? Yes.
-Anne, darling.

06:41.375 --> 06:44.166
In truth, I can hardly remember
who you are speaking of.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.000
You really think
my skin will do well in Bath?

06:47.083 --> 06:48.250
Oh, yes.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.833
-Yes.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.791
Sweetheart… it's been seven years.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.708
Eight.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.750
You couldn't possibly still feel--

07:01.833 --> 07:02.833
I do.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.625
Frederick Wentworth was the only person,

07:08.708 --> 07:10.083
save you and my mother,

07:10.750 --> 07:12.375
who ever really saw me.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.250
And understood me.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.208
And loved me.

07:20.041 --> 07:20.875
Aw.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.166
And the only one I wanted to--

07:23.250 --> 07:25.541
Exchange calling cards with?

07:27.666 --> 07:28.750
Well put.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.166
You lied when you told me
time would heal me of my pain.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.666
-You're angry with me.
-I'm angry with myself.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.333
For… being persuaded.

07:47.666 --> 07:51.000
For not seeing then
what I see so clearly now.

07:54.708 --> 07:58.541
That I would have been
a far happier woman in keeping him

07:58.625 --> 08:00.750
than I have been in giving him up.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.833
Hmm.

08:03.791 --> 08:07.000
I'm sorry. The truth is,
marriage is transactional for women.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.750
Our basic security is on the line.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.333
I could not let you throw yourself away
on a man with no rank,

08:13.416 --> 08:14.541
no fortune,

08:14.625 --> 08:16.833
nothing but himself to recommend him.

08:16.916 --> 08:18.708
That was the part I liked.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.916
Besides, all of his confidence
was justified. He is rich now.

08:24.541 --> 08:25.833
And a captain.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.708
Then, why haven't you heard from him?

08:33.666 --> 08:34.500
Because…

08:36.583 --> 08:38.041
I broke his heart.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.291
And he knew why.

08:41.166 --> 08:44.625
I thought I was protecting you.
I was wrong.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.166
I see that now.

08:47.583 --> 08:48.666
And I'm sorry.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.291
You will find the one
that's meant for you.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.208
The one who loves you enough
to fight for you.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.125
Darling, I admire how strongly
you feel about it,

09:07.208 --> 09:10.333
but at some point, you have to move on.

09:11.125 --> 09:14.166
I fear Wentworth is a ship
that has sailed,

09:14.250 --> 09:15.625
so I say this with love.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.916
Abandon all hope.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.333
It's true, he hasn't written to me.

09:44.291 --> 09:47.500
But… I knew he wouldn't.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.541
He respects himself too much to beg.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.250
He didn't fight for me because

09:58.791 --> 10:01.583
he could never value
a love that wasn't offered freely.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.083
I'm sure he's put it all behind him.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.666
I, on the other hand,

10:11.958 --> 10:14.708
have kept it painfully in front of me.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.958
The first note he passed me in church.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.916
The playlist he made me.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.833
One lock of hair from him.

10:33.291 --> 10:36.458
And one from his horse, Sampson,
whom I scarcely knew.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.000
And this cow bell,

10:40.875 --> 10:45.125
whose sad, empty knell
best captures my melancholy.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.250
Eight years of it.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.625
He's been all over.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.583
And the Navy adores him.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.750
"Frederick Wentworth turns a pretty penny
aboard the Laconia."

11:01.500 --> 11:05.083
"Frederick Wentworth
rescues a beached whale

11:05.166 --> 11:06.666
as onlookers weep."

11:09.875 --> 11:13.416
And yet… no marriage announcement.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.916
Nothing at all to indicate

11:16.000 --> 11:18.958
he's since been in any way
attached to another.

11:20.916 --> 11:22.083
In other words…

11:24.541 --> 11:27.125
hope springs eternal.

11:30.833 --> 11:34.166
As we're moving,
I need to think about my Bath persona.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
I think Bath Elizabeth should be
less sophisticated than London Elizabeth,

11:40.083 --> 11:43.833
but not as free-spirited
as country Elizabeth.

11:43.916 --> 11:45.833
Penelope, what do you think?

11:45.916 --> 11:48.208
You'll accompany the Elliots north,
Mrs. Clay?

11:48.291 --> 11:51.000
Oh, I wouldn't dream of imposing.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.208
Of course you would.
You dream of nothing but.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.875
And lucky for you, I wouldn't dream
of going anywhere without you.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.875
Mrs. Penelope Clay,

11:58.958 --> 12:01.750
widowed, though she never speaks of it.

12:01.833 --> 12:05.458
He was a corpse when they met, so perhaps
the transition escaped her attention.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.791
Lady Russell worries
that Mrs. Clay has designs on my father,

12:09.875 --> 12:12.166
but I don't think she's his type.

12:12.250 --> 12:15.125
Besides, can you actually imagine
my father marrying down?

12:15.708 --> 12:18.291
Oh, you must come,
if your father can spare you.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.791
Mr. Shepherd, do you think
you can spare Penelope?

12:22.833 --> 12:23.833
Hmm.

12:24.708 --> 12:28.583
Good, fine, exquisite, Sir Walter.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.750
You really are too generous
for your own good!

12:32.375 --> 12:34.208
We'll need
your pleasant company

12:34.291 --> 12:37.916
to make amends for the many plain faces
we shall have to endure in Bath.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.291
Now, Sir Walter,
not everyone was made to be handsome.

12:42.375 --> 12:45.583
Your beauty will shine
twice as brightly amongst them.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.208
It is said if you're a five in London,
you're a ten in Bath.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.208
Well, just think,

12:51.708 --> 12:55.000
you and Elizabeth,
you'll be thirteens there.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.541
You'll be at least a six, Anne.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.083
Anyway, Anne won't be
joining us for quite some time.

13:04.958 --> 13:05.791
What?

13:06.625 --> 13:08.208
I got a letter from Mary today.

13:08.708 --> 13:12.000
She's ill again and needs you
at Uppercross immediately.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.833
I know you barely tolerate her.

13:14.666 --> 13:18.125
Still, it's a more positive reaction
than anyone else has towards her,

13:18.708 --> 13:20.458
making you the logical choice.

13:23.583 --> 13:24.583
Fabulous.

13:30.291 --> 13:33.250
Make sure the nice linens
are hidden before the admiral arrives.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.166
Why? Do you think they'll steal them?

13:35.250 --> 13:37.791
I don't like the idea
of their naked skin on my sheets.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.375
It might bring you luck.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.875
And hide the ledgers.
I don't want anyone assuming my identity.

13:42.958 --> 13:46.041
I don't think anyone wants your credit
at this point, Father.

13:46.666 --> 13:49.416
Oh, and remind them, in a gentle way,

13:49.500 --> 13:51.666
never to go anywhere near my rose garden.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.833
Oh, yes, please. And the shrubberies.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.083
I don't like the idea of my shrubberies
being enjoyed by others.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.125
Use the scratchy linen,

13:59.208 --> 14:02.625
don't set foot in the garden
and don't look at the shrubberies.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.500
Any other hospitable words?

14:04.583 --> 14:10.125
That is all. Oh, but please make sure
every room is spotless before they arrive.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.583
I don't want rumors circulating
about dust.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.041
Oh.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.666
It's even more incredible
than we were told.

14:45.583 --> 14:48.916
You mustn't worry,
we'll be excellent tenants.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.958
Do you always travel with your husband?

14:52.041 --> 14:54.416
Oh, yes. And no one will ever stop me.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.375
I've crossed the Atlantic four times,

14:58.041 --> 15:00.750
gone once to the East Indies
and back again.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.375
Cork, Lisbon, Gibraltar…

15:04.583 --> 15:07.125
The happiest moments of my life
have been spent aboard a ship.

15:07.208 --> 15:08.875
You're very lucky.

15:08.958 --> 15:10.791
You'll see
when you're in love.

15:11.833 --> 15:14.666
You know, Anne,
Mrs. Croft's baby brother is a bachelor.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.791
He's a captain in the Navy,
quite successful.

15:18.416 --> 15:20.166
Edward, please don't.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.250
A woman without a husband
is not a problem to be solved.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.500
-I knew your brother, actually.
-Did you?

15:26.583 --> 15:28.250
-Oh, how wonderful.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.166
Perhaps we can all have dinner together
once he joins us.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.083
Joins you?

15:32.166 --> 15:34.958
-His ship just docked.
-He'll be here in two days.

15:39.250 --> 15:43.125
These gardens are so beautiful.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.333
I wonder how he feels as to a meeting.

16:00.708 --> 16:03.708
If he'd wished to see me before now,
he need not have waited.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.458
He's angry still, I'm sure.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.708
What if I've been wrong?

16:14.125 --> 16:18.125
What if he's been pining for me
day and night all these years?

16:39.625 --> 16:41.583
Whoa there!

16:52.458 --> 16:53.291
Here you are.

17:01.958 --> 17:03.666
Can someone help me?

17:06.208 --> 17:08.208
Mary is preferable to Elizabeth

17:08.291 --> 17:10.958
in that she's a total narcissist.

17:11.041 --> 17:14.000
So, conversing with her
requires very little energy

17:14.083 --> 17:15.916
and can be great fun.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.083
Once, I went an entire 24 hours

17:19.166 --> 17:21.916
speaking exclusively in Italian.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.500
She only noticed
when I asked her to pass the sale.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
She's so wrapped up in her own suffering

17:27.083 --> 17:30.375
that, until I clear my throat,
she won't even notice I'm here.

17:30.458 --> 17:31.291
Watch.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.750
First, she'll complain
about some unidentifiable ailment

17:33.833 --> 17:35.583
that has her on the verge of death.

17:35.666 --> 17:39.250
Next, she'll rail against her husband
for not caring for her properly.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.916
And then she will assault her in-laws,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.250
who constantly disrespect her
and must secretly despise her.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.666
I'm monstrously relieved you're here.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.416
I don't know what it is.
A bug of some sort.

17:55.916 --> 17:59.250
I can't move. I'm on the verge of death.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.958
Charles is out shooting,
not a single caring word on his way out.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.208
Hmm.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.833
And my in-laws sent me
that lovely bouquet.

18:07.916 --> 18:08.833
Isn't that sweet?

18:09.625 --> 18:12.750
They'll rot, and I'll feel worse
than if they hadn't sent anything at all.

18:12.833 --> 18:13.708
Hmm.

18:14.500 --> 18:18.291
How unkind is it
to remind a dying person of decay?

18:19.250 --> 18:20.708
Anne, these people hate me.

18:20.791 --> 18:23.333
The children are monsters,
the house is drafty

18:23.416 --> 18:26.166
and nobody cares
about the theater anymore.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.333
Precisely, Anne, yes.

18:27.416 --> 18:28.833
-Anne!

18:29.791 --> 18:31.333
Meet my sisters in-law,

18:31.416 --> 18:33.541
Henrietta and Louisa Musgrove.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.791
They are beautiful in every way.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.125
-Anne!
-Girls!

18:38.208 --> 18:40.916
We were so glad
when Mary said that you'd come.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.833
We've been positively giddy all week.

18:42.916 --> 18:46.125
You must promise to spend
every waking second with us, no excuses.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.541
When you aren't attending
to your sister of course.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.500
-How are you feeling, Mary?
-You haven't asked me how I'm feeling.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.250
-I just did.
-I'm close to death.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.125
I can feel my organs decomposing.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.916
-Same as yesterday, then.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.041
Encouraging that, though her organs rot,
her personality remains as fresh as ever.

19:05.125 --> 19:08.333
Anne, you must dine with us every night,
delight us with your playing,

19:08.416 --> 19:12.958
because we will do nothing
but dance and sing and laugh.

19:13.541 --> 19:14.666
Marie Antoinette!

19:14.750 --> 19:17.791
How dare you speak my name,
you naughty subjects!

19:17.875 --> 19:20.333
Careful, boys,
ladies don't like to be trampled.

19:20.416 --> 19:22.000
And your mother has a headache.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.791
To have things near your face
when you don't know where they've been!

19:24.875 --> 19:27.041
We're hungry, Marie Antoinette.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.625
-Well, let them eat cake!
-No cake until after supper.

19:29.708 --> 19:32.541
There'll be special guests tonight.
We'll meet Admiral Croft and his wife.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.500
She's bringing her brother,
Frederick Wentworth.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.125
Just arrived this morning, we hear.
A gallant captain!

19:37.208 --> 19:39.875
I heard he once redirected
an entire flotilla

19:39.958 --> 19:41.333
to save a beached whale.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.250
I had no idea
you were fond of whales.

19:49.708 --> 19:53.666
-Have you ever met Captain Wentworth?
-In passing, long ago.

19:54.291 --> 19:59.500
-Is it true he's devastatingly handsome?
-He has a kind face, yes.

19:59.583 --> 20:02.208
And is it true he actually listens
when women speak?

20:02.291 --> 20:03.583
He listens.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.166
He listens with his whole body.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.500
It's… electrifying.

20:12.833 --> 20:16.000
Well, then, he sounds like
just the man for you.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.625
-I insist you pursue him.
-Louisa…

20:18.708 --> 20:21.125
No, no. I've made up my mind, Anne.

20:21.958 --> 20:24.541
No more hiding your light
underneath a bushel.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.333
You are very sweet, but I'm not interested

20:27.416 --> 20:30.166
in receiving instruction
on where to put my light.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.041
Or my bushel.

20:33.166 --> 20:36.375
Tell me, honestly, why aren't you married?

20:39.458 --> 20:41.166
I'm waiting to fall in love.

20:42.416 --> 20:46.458
All right, here's what you'll do.
At dinner, you'll sit right next to him.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.666
I'll sit right next to him.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.500
Then, you'll pretend
not to know a thing about anything.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.375
Men like explaining things.

20:53.458 --> 20:57.000
Tell him you've never used utensils,
ask him to teach you how to hold them.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.458
Is this how they're teaching courtship
these days?

20:59.541 --> 21:03.166
Then, just when he starts
to seem interested,

21:03.250 --> 21:05.625
don't respond to a single thing he says.

21:05.708 --> 21:06.958
As though you're a ghost.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.375
He'll be hooked.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.375
So, then, just be myself.

21:13.958 --> 21:17.250
Oh no. Don't do that until at least
the second year of marriage.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.625
That may not be the worst advice.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.750
-Mary!
-Charles. What happened?

21:25.500 --> 21:27.708
Mary, help. He's hurt his arm.

21:29.416 --> 21:31.375
-What has he done?
-He fell from a tree.

21:36.208 --> 21:39.333
Of course this happens the one evening
people of interest are set to visit.

21:39.416 --> 21:40.958
He didn't fall on purpose, Mary.

21:42.166 --> 21:43.916
Someone will have to stay with him.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.375
I'll bring you back some plum pudding.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.208
So, it's the mother who must stay, then.

21:56.291 --> 21:58.708
It's not enough
I brought these humans into the world,

21:58.791 --> 22:00.875
I must now miss dinners
on account of them.

22:00.958 --> 22:02.416
This is just my luck.

22:02.958 --> 22:06.041
If there is anything disagreeable,
men are sure to get out of it.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.166
Mary, my sweet, he's hurt.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.666
And you aren't feeling
quite yourself either.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.833
Oh no, that's cleared up entirely.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.708
I'm sure the Crofts will come again.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.625
Oh, I hate my life.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.875
If it's really bothering you,
I'm happy to stay with you.

22:18.958 --> 22:21.916
That goes without saying.
Of course. I'm not gonna stay alone.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.791
Wouldn't it be hard to be away from
little Charles when he's in so much pain?

22:25.875 --> 22:26.875
No, Louisa.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.166
Please understand.

22:30.250 --> 22:34.000
The thing about me is, I am an empath.

22:35.875 --> 22:39.041
I'm actually the least equipped to be
with my children when they're suffering

22:39.125 --> 22:41.583
because I feel it so deeply.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.583
It's much better for me to be away.

22:45.875 --> 22:48.958
Life is so much easier for people
like Anne who aren't so sensitive.

22:51.375 --> 22:54.333
Mary, would you like me to stay alone
while you go to dinner?

22:55.250 --> 22:58.416
That's so kind.
I'll bring you back some plum pudding.

22:59.875 --> 23:02.583
And perhaps a crust of bread
and some gruel?

23:02.666 --> 23:04.583
Don't worry, Anne, I'll talk you up.

23:04.666 --> 23:08.625
I'll paint such a pretty picture, he'll be
ready to propose by morning. Promise.

23:30.833 --> 23:32.458
If only I could talk to him.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.416
Frederick!

23:43.500 --> 23:44.541
Oh.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.458
Oh!

23:46.041 --> 23:47.333
Oh. Ouch.

23:59.416 --> 24:00.250
Perfect.

24:05.833 --> 24:07.541
Thanks again for last night, Anne.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.083
I really think
you would have liked Captain Wentworth.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.125
Um, this jam is too soggy.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.416
I'd rather not have jam at all
if it is to be soggy.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.208
I want to be a captain.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.541
Absolutely not.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.833
No nephew of mine will be a sailor.

24:24.916 --> 24:28.250
Don't you know
they have to wear silly hats?

24:28.333 --> 24:31.291
Anne, please, I can't endure
the sound of laughter before noon.

24:31.375 --> 24:33.458
And the rules are

24:33.541 --> 24:36.875
you must grow a silly mustache.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.000
-Mm.
-No.

24:41.083 --> 24:44.833
Wentworth doesn't have
a mustache, but he is quite impressive.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.041
Handsome, intelligent, rich.

24:47.125 --> 24:49.166
-Do it again!
-Oh, look at me.

24:49.250 --> 24:52.666
I'm Captain Wentworth
and I am very impressive!

24:52.750 --> 24:56.500
I'm rich and I'm handsome
and everybody loves me!

24:56.583 --> 24:57.708
And I'm a sailor!

24:57.791 --> 25:00.250
Uh, Captain,
meet Mary's sister, Anne.

25:04.125 --> 25:06.666
-Actually, we… We've met.
-We've met.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.875
-Oh
-Long ago, before I was rich.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.250
But not before I was handsome.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.375
You look… old.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.375
-I didn't mean that.
-What did you mean?

25:21.458 --> 25:25.041
Old… Older… than you used to look.

25:25.125 --> 25:28.916
-Your face has matured.
-Small price to pay for a life of purpose.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.916
-Are you implying my life lacks purpose?
-How would I know?

25:33.250 --> 25:35.625
Your hair remains intact.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.875
Your hair is also

25:38.833 --> 25:41.000
suitably appropriate.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.833
-Thank you.
-So, then, you two really have met.

25:47.541 --> 25:50.958
-Fleetingly.
-And yet memorable in its fleetingness.

25:57.833 --> 25:58.666
Shall we go?

25:58.750 --> 26:00.125
-We shall.
-Yes.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.041
Oh.

26:13.458 --> 26:16.333
-What?
-You still have jam on your face.

26:33.041 --> 26:34.125
My dress is soaked.

26:34.208 --> 26:37.666
I told you he'd be back, Anne.
Why don't you sit next to him?

26:37.750 --> 26:38.916
Louisa.

26:50.750 --> 26:54.000
-Do come through here.
-Thank you so much.

26:58.125 --> 27:01.166
Captain Wentworth,
I'm going to keep you next to me.

27:02.041 --> 27:02.916
Certainly.

27:08.708 --> 27:09.666
Louisa.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.125
How perfect.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.166
-I'll sit next to you.
-I'll get your chair.

27:25.750 --> 27:26.958
Thank you very much.

28:09.833 --> 28:12.625
Light under bushel, check.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.166
-By the stem?
-By the stem.

28:25.166 --> 28:26.291
Quite the upgrade.

28:27.250 --> 28:28.166
From what?

28:28.250 --> 28:30.916
From whoever didn't want
to sit next to me.

28:33.916 --> 28:37.458
Now, tell me, do you have
the same trouble with spoons?

28:41.375 --> 28:42.500
Thank you.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.666
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

28:50.416 --> 28:52.583
Enjoying it. It's delicious.

28:57.375 --> 29:00.333
Captain Wentworth was telling me
how he almost died at sea.

29:00.416 --> 29:03.416
My, captain! What made you decide
on such a risky profession?

29:04.916 --> 29:07.875
When I first left shore,
I was in great need of distraction.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.875
For that, the constant threat on my life
was useful.

29:11.708 --> 29:15.500
In fact, I was in such despair,
there were times I almost wished for it.

29:16.083 --> 29:19.000
Would it be too bold to ask
the source of such desperation?

29:19.916 --> 29:21.083
A woman.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.541
Well, then, her loss.

29:23.625 --> 29:25.958
Now, though,
I've had my fill of excitement.

29:27.083 --> 29:30.375
I long for absolute boredom
to lull me back to myself.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.208
And by that you mean a wife?

29:32.750 --> 29:33.625
Mother!

29:33.708 --> 29:37.083
I mean, people and things
I can be quiet with, yes.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.083
Who better to be quiet with than a wife?

29:39.166 --> 29:40.000
Mother!

29:41.250 --> 29:43.875
-Are you in the market for a wife, boy?
-Father!

29:43.958 --> 29:45.041
No, you found me out.

29:46.125 --> 29:48.625
Here I am, ashore,
looking to make a foolish match.

29:49.625 --> 29:52.000
A little kindness, a strong mind,

29:52.541 --> 29:54.750
a few compliments to the Navy,
and I'm a lost man.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.791
Anyone between the ages of 18 and 80
may have me for the asking.

29:59.666 --> 30:00.666
Almost anyone.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.416
Charles wanted to marry me first.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.083
What's that, Anne?

30:07.416 --> 30:08.416
Um…

30:09.541 --> 30:12.125
Uh, just speaking of marriage.

30:12.208 --> 30:13.458
Um…

30:14.333 --> 30:18.541
Remember how Charles wanted
to marry me before he married Charles?

30:19.625 --> 30:20.458
I mean Mary.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.541
Sorry, Charles, um…

30:23.625 --> 30:25.583
Before she married…

30:26.166 --> 30:29.750
Sorry, before he, of course he,

30:29.833 --> 30:33.375
came to his senses and married Mary.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.708
Please go on. You'd like us to understand

30:36.791 --> 30:39.708
that your brother-in-law
once preferred you to your sister?

30:40.666 --> 30:42.375
-That's true, yes.
-It's true.

30:42.458 --> 30:45.416
Yes, it's quite right. There, there.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.291
Wentworth isn't very gallant to you, Anne.

31:04.875 --> 31:07.416
He said you were so altered
he hardly recognized you.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.375
Don't worry, I stood up for you.

31:12.125 --> 31:15.291
I told him your eye got so infected
it swelled shut for a week

31:15.375 --> 31:17.083
and then we all called you Blackbeard.

31:18.166 --> 31:21.500
I suppose that isn't sticking up for you
so much as just saying a thing.

31:22.291 --> 31:24.500
Yes, I suppose it was more that.

31:34.666 --> 31:37.375
More, Anne, please. Play for us, maestro.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.958
He was so distant last night.

32:44.458 --> 32:46.291
I'd prefer open hostility.

32:47.125 --> 32:51.375
His cold politeness and ceremonious grace
are worse than anything.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.791
"Beg your pardon, Miss Elliot,

32:54.875 --> 32:57.458
is this your chair?"

32:59.166 --> 33:00.500
Love me, you idiot!

33:00.583 --> 33:04.041
Love me or kill me now! I can't bear it!

33:08.333 --> 33:09.458
Lady Macbeth.

33:09.541 --> 33:11.666
Act three, scene four.

33:12.875 --> 33:13.708
She'll buy it.

33:14.833 --> 33:15.916
Oh, right.

33:17.833 --> 33:19.333
How are you this morning, Mary?

33:19.416 --> 33:22.500
I'm still dizzy from watching
Wentworth spin Louisa around all evening.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.541
Or as much as he could manage
with you plonk-plonking sad-sack tunes.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.708
"Für Elise" happens to be
a great dance song

33:28.791 --> 33:33.666
for those sophisticated enough
to explore less traditional movements.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.833
And how would you dance to Beethoven?

33:35.916 --> 33:38.291
Alone in my room with a bottle of red.

33:40.791 --> 33:42.416
Frederick will surely propose to Louisa.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.041
Then they'll be married
and then Louisa will be happy forever.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.666
Why must everyone always assume
that all women want

33:48.750 --> 33:51.250
is to be chosen by any eligible bachelor?

33:51.333 --> 33:54.458
Because marriage is the greatest blessing
that life can offer.

33:57.791 --> 33:59.000
Where are your children?

34:00.583 --> 34:01.666
How should I know?

34:11.291 --> 34:14.666
Nobody tells you when you're young
that life keeps going.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.541
It keeps going whether you approve
of the progression or not.

34:21.708 --> 34:24.333
And, eventually,
you find yourself wondering,

34:24.875 --> 34:26.500
"How did I end up here?"

34:27.958 --> 34:31.791
A heartbeat ago, there were no two souls
more in rhythm than Wentworth and I.

34:33.416 --> 34:35.000
Now we're strangers.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.250
Worse than strangers.

34:39.541 --> 34:41.250
We're exes.

34:42.625 --> 34:44.125
Auntie Anne.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.375
-Where are you?
-Come and play.

34:56.916 --> 34:57.875
Ha!

34:57.958 --> 35:00.791
Marie Antoinette, Marie Antoinette,
the people don't want you.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.291
They don't want to have a queen anymore.

35:03.375 --> 35:07.416
How dare you speak to me that way!
You are my subjects.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.750
Bad queen!

35:08.833 --> 35:11.083
Bad queen? Bad subject!

35:11.166 --> 35:14.125
-Wait, what's the words again?
-Vive la révolution.

35:14.208 --> 35:16.041
Vive la revolution!

35:16.125 --> 35:18.291
Haha! This is mine. This is my crown.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
How dare you take my crown!

35:22.583 --> 35:24.625
-You got me!

35:24.708 --> 35:26.875
-Okay. That's enough! Boys!
-Bad queen!

35:27.791 --> 35:29.125
-No!

35:36.541 --> 35:39.458
That was quite reckless.
The boy could have been hurt.

35:40.375 --> 35:43.333
You're right. I'm sorry.
We got carried away.

35:43.416 --> 35:45.708
-Save it for Robespierre.
-Frederick!

35:47.791 --> 35:49.166
I'm doing my best.

35:50.125 --> 35:51.583
Your best? About what?

35:51.666 --> 35:55.166
About you and me.
I don't want you to be angry.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.791
What would you want me to be?

36:22.375 --> 36:24.583
I'm just too kind, Anne,
that's my problem.

36:24.666 --> 36:28.125
I give all of my attention to others
and then I suffer for it.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.625
How far is the Colosseum?

36:31.250 --> 36:34.041
Mmm, you're right,
but how do I prioritize self-care

36:34.125 --> 36:36.708
with everyone around me
constantly bidding for my attention?

36:36.791 --> 36:38.625
One cappuccino, please!

36:39.666 --> 36:43.791
What I've realized is
I need to fall in love with myself first,

36:43.875 --> 36:47.583
and then I can truly love those around me,
and that's all there is to it.

36:49.583 --> 36:50.666
Oh!

36:51.375 --> 36:54.041
How much is that porcupine
in the window?

36:55.208 --> 36:57.875
-What's behind me?
-Cheese roll?

37:01.416 --> 37:04.791
Are you trying to go somewhere without me
and gesturing to keep it a secret?

37:06.000 --> 37:09.208
We are going for a-a walk, Mary.

37:09.291 --> 37:11.125
-Very long walk.
-Through the woods.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.458
-You hate nature.
-You hate moving your legs.

37:13.541 --> 37:15.125
You made us carry you home last time.

37:15.208 --> 37:17.833
So, you assume because I hate something
I don't want to do it?

37:19.583 --> 37:20.583
Um…

37:23.458 --> 37:24.791
Great.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.625
Bugs everywhere.

37:37.166 --> 37:38.208
-Anne.
-Hmm?

37:38.291 --> 37:40.625
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you,

37:41.541 --> 37:43.291
but I'm ashamed.

37:43.916 --> 37:44.916
What is it?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.666
You remember
when Captain Wentworth first came

37:47.750 --> 37:50.083
and I encouraged you to pursue him?

37:51.083 --> 37:52.166
Yes.

37:52.250 --> 37:55.125
Well, that was before I knew him,
of course.

37:55.208 --> 37:58.083
And I genuinely hoped
that you two would be a match.

37:58.833 --> 38:00.333
Not that you seem at all interested.

38:02.083 --> 38:04.250
-Don't I?
-You barely look at him.

38:07.666 --> 38:09.375
And now you'd like him for yourself?

38:10.166 --> 38:11.166
He's everything.

38:14.666 --> 38:15.916
You seem surprised.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.750
I suppose I am. I thought you two were--

38:20.833 --> 38:24.291
I don't know how he feels,
but I'm falling in love.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.750
I've thought quite a lot about how
I would feel were our roles reversed.

38:29.833 --> 38:32.083
I might be hurt, perhaps even jealous,

38:32.166 --> 38:36.666
but I can honestly say that any sorrow
for myself would be entirely eclipsed

38:37.208 --> 38:39.708
by the pleasure I would take
in seeing you happy.

38:39.791 --> 38:42.958
-You're trying very hard here.

38:43.750 --> 38:44.916
Is it working?

38:47.541 --> 38:50.125
I don't understand
why you think you need my permission

38:50.208 --> 38:51.625
if you say I barely look at him.

38:51.708 --> 38:53.625
Because it's the way
you barely look at him.

38:54.500 --> 38:58.375
I know what I'm watching and it's more
than two people who have merely met.

39:01.541 --> 39:04.666
What you're seeing is… the past.

39:04.750 --> 39:08.250
Look, I believe
this man could be my future.

39:45.875 --> 39:49.791
And a frigate is larger
than a sloop, correct?

39:50.541 --> 39:52.791
-Someone's been studying.
-Very good.

39:53.291 --> 39:58.041
A sloop is crewed by 130 men or so,
while a frigate can carry 140 to 200.

39:58.125 --> 40:00.791
Depending on whether
it's fifth or sixth rate, I suppose.

40:07.500 --> 40:12.166
"Now May with all her smiling trains
of vernal beauty sticks--"

40:12.250 --> 40:15.250
That's more than enough poetry.
You know how much I detest metaphor.

40:15.750 --> 40:19.750
Sorry, Mary, I'd forgotten.
My mind is like a sieve.

40:20.416 --> 40:22.958
Which is a simile, not a metaphor.

40:23.750 --> 40:27.125
Fine. My mind is a sieve.

40:28.250 --> 40:31.041
Whatever your mind is,
stop using words imaginatively.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.625
I can't bear it.

40:37.291 --> 40:39.333
Look! We could drop in
on Harry Hayter.

40:39.416 --> 40:41.500
Perhaps he's worked up the nerve
to propose to me.

40:41.583 --> 40:44.541
Not that I had any intention
for leading us in this direction.

40:44.625 --> 40:47.500
No, absolutely not.
I will not enter the Hayter house.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.291
I'm sure to contract
some terrible illness.

40:49.375 --> 40:50.958
Mary, don't be ridiculous.

40:51.041 --> 40:53.041
Is it ridiculous to care for one's health?

40:54.166 --> 40:58.166
Households employing fewer
than five servants are unsanitary.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.875
Please don't judge us
by our poor relations, captain.

41:02.958 --> 41:05.000
It's unpleasant having such connections.

41:05.083 --> 41:08.250
Just to be clear, you disapprove of him
for your sister-in-law

41:08.333 --> 41:10.583
because he is not wealthy enough?

41:10.666 --> 41:12.625
I know.
It really is awful, isn't it?

41:18.875 --> 41:19.708
Shall we?

41:48.416 --> 41:51.958
It's that Elliot pride.
I find it detestable.

41:52.458 --> 41:56.250
To know Sir Walter, one might believe
the title of Baronet second only to King.

41:56.333 --> 41:59.291
Lord knows how sweet Anne
came out of that lot.

41:59.375 --> 42:02.666
We all so wish Charles had married her
instead. Don't you agree?

42:02.750 --> 42:04.833
-Don't let her fool you.
-What do you mean?

42:06.208 --> 42:09.875
Anne Elliot has as much pride as the rest.
It just takes a different form.

42:09.958 --> 42:11.375
I don't understand.

42:12.750 --> 42:15.708
Next time you witness Miss Elliot
quietly installing herself

42:15.791 --> 42:18.291
on the outskirts of some social situation,

42:18.375 --> 42:22.416
consider whether she might assume
this vantage in order to judge everyone.

42:23.250 --> 42:24.083
Harshly.

42:24.791 --> 42:26.791
Anne Elliot is pure kindness.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.041
You don't know her like I do.

42:30.541 --> 42:33.250
You are the one
who is pure kindness, Louisa,

42:33.333 --> 42:36.166
and for this reason
you always assume the best of others.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.333
The truest evidence of an inferior mind

42:39.416 --> 42:42.541
is to allow oneself to be persuaded away
from one's deepest convictions.

42:42.625 --> 42:44.333
What deepest convictions?

42:50.083 --> 42:53.541
I won't have you speak ill of Anne.
She is too dear to me.

42:53.625 --> 42:56.125
I don't know what happened between you
and I'm not asking.

42:56.625 --> 43:00.041
I do see the best in her,
and I implore you to look for it too.

43:01.791 --> 43:05.083
Please forgive me. I've been too harsh.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.125
Thank you for calling me to task.

43:11.125 --> 43:14.000
If I forgive you,
will you teach me how to read a sextant?

43:14.666 --> 43:17.125
-On such short acquaintance?
-I'm free this evening.

43:23.875 --> 43:25.000
Shall we wander?

43:55.500 --> 43:57.875
There's nothing worse
than thinking your life is ruined

43:57.958 --> 44:02.041
and then realizing
you've got much, much further to fall.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.041
Like I said.

44:42.625 --> 44:44.416
How lovely to see you.

44:50.041 --> 44:52.416
-She's injured.
-Shall I ask her?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.541
Anne? Anne, may we offer you a ride home?

44:57.291 --> 45:00.916
-Thank you. I'm quite all right.
-Anne, you've clearly hurt your foot.

45:01.458 --> 45:04.166
It's hardly ten minutes out of our way.
Please, come.

45:04.250 --> 45:07.208
You're so kind.
And I'm so enjoying the fresh air.

45:07.291 --> 45:08.833
Must you be so proud?

45:11.375 --> 45:12.625
Please, let this be easy.

45:40.208 --> 45:41.041
James.

45:42.541 --> 45:43.500
Come here.

45:45.125 --> 45:47.708
I need a favor from you.
Do you think you can help?

45:48.916 --> 45:53.625
I need you to hug me so tightly
that I can't feel my body anymore.

45:53.708 --> 45:55.625
-Do you think you can do that?
-Mm-hmm.

46:03.583 --> 46:05.333
James, tea time.

46:05.416 --> 46:09.500
Anne. Anne, we are going to Lyme.
Tomorrow.

46:09.583 --> 46:12.166
It's been decided.
We'll spend the night by the sea.

46:12.750 --> 46:14.000
To Lyme? Why?

46:14.500 --> 46:17.208
Captain Wentworth wants us
to meet some of his Navy friends.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.791
-I'm not quite up for a trip, I'm afraid.
-What?

46:20.875 --> 46:25.750
Anne, we're going to Lyme tomorrow.
I need 24 hours away from the terrors.

46:25.833 --> 46:27.000
No, wait.

46:27.083 --> 46:28.333
Mary, I'm not--

46:28.416 --> 46:31.333
No. You're always out to ruin my fun
and I won't have it.

46:31.416 --> 46:33.500
I need a holiday, and I need you with me

46:33.583 --> 46:36.583
to have someone to talk at
when the others stop feeling obligated.

46:39.583 --> 46:40.916
Shockingly self-aware.

47:13.291 --> 47:15.000
Captain, this is Anne Elliot.

47:16.958 --> 47:18.000
Anne Elliot.

47:20.291 --> 47:21.541
Captain Harville.

47:21.625 --> 47:22.916
Pleasure to meet you.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.458
Please excuse me.

47:27.791 --> 47:31.166
Now, you are a fan of poetry.
Or is that just a rumor?

47:31.875 --> 47:35.250
You seem to know more of me
than I can hardly be comfortable with.

47:35.333 --> 47:37.208
Forgive me, I'm just hatching a plot.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.125
-You see our friend over there?
-Yes.

47:40.208 --> 47:41.541
Captain Benwick.

47:41.625 --> 47:44.791
Now, Captain Benwick has also
considerable taste in reading.

47:44.875 --> 47:47.333
But he has fallen into a sadness.

47:48.041 --> 47:51.916
I wondered if you might
take a moment to talk to him?

47:52.000 --> 47:56.458
I can build a house out of driftwood,
but don't ever ask me about the Greeks.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.250
What's the source
of his sorrow?

47:59.333 --> 48:01.833
Home from Troy and there's another man
in his bed?

48:02.333 --> 48:04.291
Sorry, Agamemnon joke.

48:06.458 --> 48:08.916
He was engaged to my sister Fanny.

48:09.625 --> 48:11.250
And they were very much in love.

48:12.291 --> 48:17.041
And she died while he was at sea,
just before they were set to be married.

48:17.125 --> 48:18.458
I'm so sorry.

48:20.041 --> 48:22.000
They say the universe always has a plan.

48:29.041 --> 48:31.875
-So, will you? Speak to him.
-I'd be happy to.

48:31.958 --> 48:35.458
Though I'm not sure I'm the messenger
the universe has in mind.

48:36.458 --> 48:37.708
Trust me, it's never wrong.

48:39.333 --> 48:42.583
All that is meant for one
is meant to find one.

48:43.583 --> 48:44.666
I promise.

48:49.666 --> 48:51.833
And while you're at it,
convince our friend Wentworth

48:51.916 --> 48:54.333
that he'd be a fool
to ignore the Navy much longer.

48:54.416 --> 48:56.958
-I hate to see a talent wasted.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.416
If only I had influence.

48:59.500 --> 49:02.375
Tonight at dinner? You get him drunk.
I'll smuggle him aboard.

49:02.458 --> 49:03.958
Perhaps you should ask Louisa.

49:04.625 --> 49:05.583
I'm asking you.

49:08.833 --> 49:09.666
Shall we?

49:11.791 --> 49:14.166
Not tempted
to have a dip in the water, are you?

49:14.958 --> 49:16.500
Thank you. Promise?

49:17.833 --> 49:18.958
Come on, Mary.

49:26.666 --> 49:31.333
Wentworth, of course, refused to admit
that he had got the coordinates wrong.

49:31.416 --> 49:33.625
Captain Wentworth is very stubborn.

49:33.708 --> 49:36.583
Stubborn indeed.
He could be an admiral some day,

49:36.666 --> 49:39.333
great service to the Crown
and all that it holds dear,

49:39.416 --> 49:42.625
but instead he'd rather fart around inland
for the rest of his life.

49:42.708 --> 49:45.166
Oh, let the man fart where he likes.

49:45.250 --> 49:47.166
I would like to have a family one day.

49:48.125 --> 49:49.000
As you well know,

49:49.083 --> 49:52.125
the wife of a sailor pays a tax
for her husband's chosen path.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.583
It is but a small fee.

49:54.208 --> 49:57.458
Constant worry.
I'd hate to ask that of anyone.

49:57.541 --> 49:58.541
That's ridiculous.

49:59.375 --> 50:00.958
No life is without worry.

50:01.458 --> 50:02.375
Harville is right.

50:04.125 --> 50:04.958
Anne.

50:07.041 --> 50:10.750
Your future wife will be perfectly capable
of managing her own feelings.

50:11.541 --> 50:16.125
Don't patronize her by deciding for her
what worries she can and cannot endure.

50:16.208 --> 50:17.375
Who knows?

50:17.458 --> 50:21.416
Perhaps she'll even be forging
her own adventures at home.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.541
Right, who wants more wine?

50:23.625 --> 50:24.666
Yes. Yes.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.458
-Yeah? Okay, good.
-Yes. Yes.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.083
Lord Byron.

50:38.416 --> 50:40.250
"She was my life's unerring light."

50:40.333 --> 50:42.791
"That quench'd,
what beams shall break my night."

50:44.166 --> 50:48.333
Yes. He's got me
through a self-pitying night or two.

50:50.083 --> 50:52.750
I often think
it is the great misfortune of poetry

50:52.833 --> 50:55.291
that it's seldom enjoyed safely

50:55.375 --> 50:57.875
by those capable
of enjoying it completely.

50:58.625 --> 51:00.333
Only people who know loss

51:01.000 --> 51:02.416
can really appreciate Byron.

51:03.833 --> 51:06.250
But those people
should only taste him sparingly.

51:07.125 --> 51:10.291
Otherwise, they'll be left
more deeply in their sorrow.

51:11.166 --> 51:13.375
-Then, what are those people meant to do?

51:15.000 --> 51:18.166
Honestly, I've been trying
to work that out for eight years now.

51:23.625 --> 51:26.500
I can only tell you
what I must repeat to myself daily.

51:27.791 --> 51:31.416
You're young. You don't know
what the future has in store.

51:32.458 --> 51:35.916
You will rally,
and you will be happy again.

51:38.750 --> 51:40.416
-Perhaps you're right.
-I know I am.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.791
-Thank you, Miss Elliot.

52:02.916 --> 52:06.000
I'm only saying, the lower ranks
are taxed disproportionately.

52:14.041 --> 52:18.041
-Who is that?
-Pardon me. I think I'm in your way.

52:19.291 --> 52:20.750
Perhaps you can correct that.

52:24.541 --> 52:25.375
Perhaps.

52:30.333 --> 52:31.166
Hello.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.875
Can I help you with something?

52:40.333 --> 52:43.958
Considering what I'd like help with,
probably not.

52:47.958 --> 52:48.875
Hmm.

53:38.666 --> 53:39.666
Hello.

53:41.708 --> 53:42.541
Hello.

53:44.541 --> 53:48.000
-I'm sorry about this morning.
-What happened this morning?

53:48.083 --> 53:50.833
I'm speaking of that rude gentleman
we encountered.

53:51.583 --> 53:54.416
I'm not your older brother.
You don't need my protection.

53:56.666 --> 53:59.000
In any event, you've never had trouble
speaking for yourself.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.541
No apology necessary.

54:04.583 --> 54:06.416
It was clearly well intended.

54:10.583 --> 54:13.750
Look, we haven't really
had a chance to talk.

54:16.083 --> 54:20.125
I've lived with a thousand different
imagined versions of you over the years.

54:21.166 --> 54:22.708
Some to rail against.

54:25.375 --> 54:26.458
Some to cherish.

54:28.500 --> 54:29.333
Likewise.

54:32.875 --> 54:34.791
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

54:35.333 --> 54:37.541
Or if you knew how much I cared.

54:39.625 --> 54:40.750
I think I always knew.

54:44.166 --> 54:45.750
There's no one quite like you.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.041
And it's clear to me
that I want you in my life.

54:51.916 --> 54:54.625
No matter what form that takes.
Bury the past and…

55:00.875 --> 55:03.333
I suppose what I'm getting at is, um…

55:06.625 --> 55:07.625
I…

55:12.125 --> 55:14.916
I would like to be friends.

55:23.291 --> 55:27.333
I was… I was thinking the same.

55:37.583 --> 55:40.250
I saw so clearly this morning the prison

55:41.333 --> 55:42.833
my resentment had created.

55:45.750 --> 55:49.250
I genuinely hope you find love
wherever you need to find it.

55:49.333 --> 55:50.458
And I thank you,

55:51.916 --> 55:54.791
from the bottom of my heart,
for your offer of friendship.

55:55.916 --> 55:56.750
Thank you.

55:57.416 --> 55:58.250
Thank you.

56:00.541 --> 56:01.375
Well…

56:03.958 --> 56:04.791
Excellent.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.750
Good… talk.

56:11.750 --> 56:15.000
I really do hope you'll be open
to pursuing the admiralty.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.916
Everyone speaks to your genius.

56:20.166 --> 56:21.625
I'm sure they understate it.

56:25.125 --> 56:29.208
They don't really know who I am
or what would make me happy.

56:30.041 --> 56:31.000
Well, I do.

56:33.208 --> 56:34.208
I know you.

56:35.208 --> 56:38.375
And I know you want a life of consequence.

56:38.458 --> 56:40.083
And I know you'd be brilliant.

56:44.250 --> 56:46.583
-You want to know a secret?
-Always.

56:47.791 --> 56:49.875
My most grim moments at sea,

56:51.250 --> 56:53.750
when I felt completely lost and confused

56:53.833 --> 56:56.041
and inadequate,

56:57.958 --> 56:59.375
I would ask myself,

57:01.125 --> 57:02.458
"What would Anne do here?"

57:04.083 --> 57:05.833
That's how I'd know how to proceed.

57:07.041 --> 57:08.291
Pretending I was you.

57:10.500 --> 57:12.125
-You lie.
-I truth.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.750
You're always best in an emergency.

57:16.458 --> 57:18.416
Anticipating the needs of others.

57:19.500 --> 57:22.375
Direct and focused, calm and thoughtful.

57:23.041 --> 57:25.541
Equipped with more intelligence
than does you good.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.500
No, you're an exceptional person.

57:30.166 --> 57:33.083
It angers me the world denies you
the chance of a public life.

57:33.166 --> 57:34.458
You'd make a great admiral.

57:36.916 --> 57:37.750
Thanks.

57:43.458 --> 57:46.625
Don't go out too far.
There's riptides and such.

57:48.375 --> 57:52.125
Sorry. There I go
trying to protect you again.

57:54.083 --> 57:54.916
As you were.

58:12.125 --> 58:13.750
Now we're worse than exes.

58:16.916 --> 58:17.958
We're friends.

1:00:00.250 --> 1:00:01.708
Now you are in my way.

1:00:04.750 --> 1:00:06.375
-Excuse me.
-Before you go,

1:00:07.250 --> 1:00:09.250
allow me a proper introduction.

1:00:09.333 --> 1:00:12.125
Or is your minder waiting round the corner
to tell me off again?

1:00:12.916 --> 1:00:15.583
He's my friend,

1:00:15.666 --> 1:00:19.333
and I believe
he misconstrued your intentions.

1:00:19.416 --> 1:00:22.500
My intentions were construed
most accurately.

1:00:23.166 --> 1:00:24.833
I intended for you to notice me.

1:00:26.041 --> 1:00:26.875
Miss?

1:00:27.916 --> 1:00:28.750
Miss.

1:00:29.541 --> 1:00:31.083
-Simple. I like it.
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:31.625 --> 1:00:32.708
Will I see you again?

1:00:34.750 --> 1:00:37.208
We must entrust that to providence.

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:40.500
That means I haven't yet made up my mind.

1:00:51.708 --> 1:00:52.791
What?

1:00:52.875 --> 1:00:53.833
What is it, Anne?

1:00:54.458 --> 1:00:56.208
The man we passed yesterday.

1:01:01.375 --> 1:01:05.291
Excuse me. Can you tell me the name
of the gentleman who just left?

1:01:05.375 --> 1:01:08.875
That's Mr. William Walter Elliot, miss,
en route to Bath.

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.458
Of course he drives off
just as I get to the window.

1:01:15.541 --> 1:01:17.625
-A cousin?
-Not just a cousin, Henrietta.

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:20.500
Our father's heir.
We should write to Father at once.

1:01:21.083 --> 1:01:23.875
That news would not be welcome,
Mary, as well you know.

1:01:23.958 --> 1:01:27.083
-He'll be furious.
-What happened between them?

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:30.041
-My father and Mr. Elliot do not speak.

1:01:30.125 --> 1:01:32.708
-I love a little bit of family gossip.
-Tell us.

1:01:32.791 --> 1:01:35.750
Mr. Elliot will inherit the baronetcy
and the estate no matter what.

1:01:35.833 --> 1:01:37.958
Father was desperate
that he marry Elizabeth

1:01:38.041 --> 1:01:40.041
to keep the title within his direct line.

1:01:40.125 --> 1:01:41.708
But he turned her down.

1:01:41.791 --> 1:01:45.000
We learned that he had married
an American woman who nobody knew.

1:01:45.083 --> 1:01:47.291
Father threw a platter of canapés
across the room.

1:01:48.916 --> 1:01:51.750
-Wasn't Mr. Elliot in mourning clothes?
-His wife's dead.

1:01:55.291 --> 1:01:58.666
You must hate him for all the
embarrassment he's caused your family.

1:02:00.166 --> 1:02:02.500
Actually, so far
it's his most winning quality.

1:02:51.125 --> 1:02:53.375
He's a lucky man to have met Louisa.

1:02:54.041 --> 1:02:57.750
Hmm. Has he said anything to you
about how he feels?

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:00.208
No, she has.

1:03:05.791 --> 1:03:07.500
It's quite steep. Careful.

1:03:14.708 --> 1:03:15.875
Thank you.

1:03:19.583 --> 1:03:20.583
Do be careful.

1:03:26.125 --> 1:03:28.125
-Catch me, Captain.
-Oh, goodness.

1:03:28.208 --> 1:03:30.291
-Oh.

1:03:37.375 --> 1:03:39.875
Okay, that was your warm-up. Once more.

1:03:39.958 --> 1:03:42.041
No, Louisa, that's enough. No more.

1:03:42.125 --> 1:03:45.083
I'm jumping, so either catch me or don't.

1:03:46.541 --> 1:03:48.000
-Louisa!
-No, no, no, no.

1:03:48.083 --> 1:03:51.708
-Louisa!
-No. Don't move her. Louisa?

1:03:51.791 --> 1:03:54.375
Can you hear me? Uh, we need a doctor.

1:03:54.458 --> 1:03:55.333
I'll go.

1:03:55.416 --> 1:03:58.250
No, someone who knows the town.
Benwick, get a doctor.

1:03:58.333 --> 1:03:59.666
-Hurry!
-Louisa.

1:04:00.208 --> 1:04:02.791
-Anne, tell me what can I do?
-Just be patient.

1:04:05.916 --> 1:04:09.541
She's still breathing.
It's all right, she's breathing.

1:04:09.625 --> 1:04:11.833
She's had
quite a severe concussion.

1:04:12.458 --> 1:04:14.791
But I've seen far greater injuries
recovered from.

1:04:15.833 --> 1:04:17.500
There's reason to be hopeful.

1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:20.708
-Leave her to rest now.
-Yes.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:23.458
-She can stay here?
-Of course.

1:04:24.250 --> 1:04:27.083
No, you've been so kind,
we can't continue to impose.

1:04:27.166 --> 1:04:28.875
She'll stay as long as she needs.

1:04:29.458 --> 1:04:32.125
Whoever doesn't mind a spot on the floor
is welcome to stay with her.

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:34.750
Anne should stay.
To assist you, Mrs. Harville.

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:37.333
No one so capable, so perfect as Anne.

1:04:38.583 --> 1:04:40.625
-You will stay, won't you?
-Of course.

1:04:43.458 --> 1:04:45.416
I can't bear to leave until she's awake.

1:04:45.916 --> 1:04:47.750
I'll deliver news
to the Musgroves.

1:04:48.250 --> 1:04:49.791
-Thank you.

1:04:49.875 --> 1:04:52.500
Would you be so kind
as to escort Mary and Henrietta?

1:04:52.583 --> 1:04:53.625
Escort me?

1:04:54.166 --> 1:04:55.666
The children, Mary.

1:04:55.750 --> 1:04:58.083
We can't have them stay
with my parents an extra night.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:05:00.541
Nearly burned the house down last time.

1:05:01.083 --> 1:05:04.916
Why should Anne stay?
Anne who means nothing to Louisa.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.208
-Oh, Mary.
-It was my understanding, Mary,

1:05:07.291 --> 1:05:10.541
that you suffered from an allergy
to houses of fewer than five servants.

1:05:11.041 --> 1:05:12.833
Aren't you worried
you'll contract something?

1:05:14.458 --> 1:05:16.666
I'm not leaving.
Have a good journey, Anne.

1:05:32.333 --> 1:05:35.416
It's not your fault.
You told her not to leap.

1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:37.333
In words, yes.

1:05:38.583 --> 1:05:40.708
-But in other ways…
-In other ways?

1:05:40.791 --> 1:05:44.666
I led her to believe I was a person
who was prepared to catch her.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.583
How exactly did you do that?

1:05:48.625 --> 1:05:50.250
I knew she was infatuated

1:05:51.375 --> 1:05:53.291
and yet did nothing to discourage her.

1:05:55.833 --> 1:05:57.041
Clearly, it led to this.

1:05:59.666 --> 1:06:00.791
Had this not occurred,

1:06:01.875 --> 1:06:04.333
one can only imagine
what our lives might have been.

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.625
Now I'm responsible for her.

1:06:09.875 --> 1:06:11.458
How do I tell her parents?

1:06:12.125 --> 1:06:13.125
Calmly.

1:06:14.541 --> 1:06:15.541
Be direct.

1:06:15.625 --> 1:06:18.208
Offer whatever services
they may require of you.

1:06:34.541 --> 1:06:35.625
Good luck.

1:06:38.583 --> 1:06:39.750
What will you do now?

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:42.583
I need to go to Bath.

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:45.333
Thank you.

1:06:46.458 --> 1:06:47.541
For everything.

1:07:10.125 --> 1:07:10.958
How is it

1:07:12.208 --> 1:07:15.250
that life can remain static,

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:21.166
almost obstinately resistant to any change
for years at a time, and then…

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:26.916
without warning become flooded
with so much newness

1:07:27.791 --> 1:07:29.750
within the course of a few weeks?

1:07:32.875 --> 1:07:35.583
It's impossible to recall life
before the torrents.

1:07:37.333 --> 1:07:41.375
That poor girl.
How are her parents?

1:07:41.458 --> 1:07:44.208
In shock,
but trying to stay hopeful.

1:07:44.291 --> 1:07:46.583
Well,
that's all they can do.

1:07:47.458 --> 1:07:50.416
Now, where are they?

1:07:51.541 --> 1:07:53.041
Where are they?

1:07:53.125 --> 1:07:55.375
-It's fine, we don't need them.

1:07:55.458 --> 1:07:57.875
I wanted it to be perfect for you.

1:07:57.958 --> 1:08:01.583
Don't be silly,
I'm happy just to be here with you.

1:08:01.666 --> 1:08:04.541
No, no, no.
It's not a picnic without macaroons.

1:08:06.875 --> 1:08:10.625
Henry would have thrown a fit
if they'd forgotten to pack the dessert.

1:08:10.708 --> 1:08:13.416
Well, lucky for you,
I don't really care for macaroons.

1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:15.083
-Hmm.
-And I'm not Henry.

1:08:16.791 --> 1:08:17.791
No.

1:08:18.958 --> 1:08:19.875
Nobody is.

1:08:24.041 --> 1:08:26.833
Do you ever think
about spending time with someone else?

1:08:27.750 --> 1:08:29.083
Several men have offered.

1:08:30.416 --> 1:08:32.125
Do you know whose company I enjoy?

1:08:35.666 --> 1:08:37.000
My own.

1:08:39.166 --> 1:08:42.875
There's a reason widowed men die soonest
and unmarried women live longest.

1:08:42.958 --> 1:08:44.458
We're great company.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:47.958
But do you ever miss… company?

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.500
Why do you think I take
so many European tours?

1:08:54.916 --> 1:08:56.708
Lady Russell!

1:08:58.791 --> 1:08:59.666
Shh.

1:09:02.333 --> 1:09:06.500
I hope I haven't eaten too much.
There's sure to be a feast tonight.

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:08.583
We're to meet the famous Mr. Elliot.

1:09:08.666 --> 1:09:11.125
But why is he courting Father's favor now?

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:15.500
Well, Elizabeth, of course, assumes
it is she who motivates him

1:09:15.583 --> 1:09:17.541
with all of her charms.

1:09:17.625 --> 1:09:20.208
Mr. Elliot has nothing to gain
from my father.

1:09:20.291 --> 1:09:23.458
He is richer than him
and will inherit his title no matter what.

1:09:23.541 --> 1:09:26.791
-He must be after something.
-Why are you so suspicious of him?

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:29.500
Because anyone that attractive
must have an angle.

1:09:31.416 --> 1:09:34.041
-What are you keeping from me?
-I've seen Mr. Elliot.

1:09:35.666 --> 1:09:36.875
And he's attractive.

1:09:38.250 --> 1:09:39.500
Very attractive.

1:09:40.208 --> 1:09:41.125
You met him?

1:09:41.625 --> 1:09:44.916
In Lyme, though neither of us knew
who we were meeting.

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.875
-Do I sense a romance brewing?
-That's not going to happen.

1:09:48.958 --> 1:09:51.666
-Because?
-Because he is a ten.

1:09:52.666 --> 1:09:54.041
I never trust a ten.

1:09:54.125 --> 1:09:55.250
Oh!

1:09:57.708 --> 1:09:59.000
This is you.

1:10:01.166 --> 1:10:03.083
This is his idea of downsizing?

1:10:03.583 --> 1:10:05.000
It's a start.

1:10:05.958 --> 1:10:07.041
Don't make me.

1:10:07.125 --> 1:10:08.583
Courage, ma chérie.

1:10:09.166 --> 1:10:10.250
I'll see you tonight.

1:10:33.833 --> 1:10:38.333
-Anne! I'm so happy to see you.
-What do you mean by that?

1:10:38.416 --> 1:10:42.250
Mr. Elliot is on his way and I want him
to see what I look like next to you.

1:10:42.833 --> 1:10:44.416
-It's good to be home.
-Just think.

1:10:44.916 --> 1:10:47.166
He's been nursing a crush on me
for nearly a decade.

1:10:47.666 --> 1:10:49.500
Poor man. How he must have suffered.

1:10:50.250 --> 1:10:53.291
All the way through a marriage
he ran away from you to secure.

1:10:53.375 --> 1:10:56.500
Isn't it mad? He must have presumed
I was out of his league.

1:10:56.583 --> 1:10:58.791
I can't imagine any other reason.

1:11:00.708 --> 1:11:02.833
I'm never quite sure
whether you're insulting me,

1:11:02.916 --> 1:11:05.541
but I value your regard so little
that I don't mind either way.

1:11:06.041 --> 1:11:08.458
Ah, Anne. Is that what you're wearing?

1:11:09.541 --> 1:11:11.375
Mr. Elliot will be here any moment.

1:11:11.458 --> 1:11:12.750
I was surprised, Father,

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:15.666
to learn how forgiving you've been
after all he made you suffer.

1:11:15.750 --> 1:11:16.583
Suffer?

1:11:17.583 --> 1:11:19.500
Well, there were many insults.

1:11:19.583 --> 1:11:20.958
He denies making them.

1:11:21.041 --> 1:11:22.666
Father, he made them to you.

1:11:24.041 --> 1:11:25.708
He was very strong in his denial.

1:11:27.250 --> 1:11:28.666
Oh, that's him.

1:11:29.500 --> 1:11:31.583
Get the door, Anne. And don't slouch.

1:11:32.958 --> 1:11:33.791
Hurry up!

1:11:34.833 --> 1:11:35.666
Gosh.

1:11:44.125 --> 1:11:44.958
Thank you.

1:11:46.833 --> 1:11:47.958
Ah.

1:11:53.375 --> 1:11:56.083
It seems like providence
plays for my team after all.

1:11:56.166 --> 1:11:58.000
I'm your cousin, Anne.

1:11:58.083 --> 1:11:59.958
Cousin? Interesting.

1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:05.166
It's a decided step up from passerby,
but still a bit short of "most beloved".

1:12:05.250 --> 1:12:07.166
But I am willing to work for my titles.

1:12:07.250 --> 1:12:10.166
Imagine my luck,
a flirt and a hard worker.

1:12:10.250 --> 1:12:11.375
Don't forget rich.

1:12:11.458 --> 1:12:13.375
Lucky we have you to remind us.

1:12:13.875 --> 1:12:15.666
What in God's name is happening?

1:12:15.750 --> 1:12:18.000
Don't worry, darling,
he's just practicing on me.

1:12:21.666 --> 1:12:22.500
Shall we?

1:12:48.541 --> 1:12:51.083
I understand you've been visiting
my sister quite often.

1:12:51.666 --> 1:12:53.750
She is delighted by the attention.

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:59.041
Well, it's nice to hear
that your sister is capable of delight.

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:02.250
But romance has been
the last thing from my mind.

1:13:03.541 --> 1:13:04.541
Until today.

1:13:07.083 --> 1:13:10.541
Well, if you haven't been coming
for the purpose of courtship, then…

1:13:12.333 --> 1:13:15.375
-Mrs. Clay, of course.
-Mrs. Clay?

1:13:15.458 --> 1:13:19.125
About a month ago, I received word
that my uncle had appeared in Bath

1:13:19.208 --> 1:13:21.291
in the company of a woman of low birth.

1:13:22.083 --> 1:13:24.291
Many presumed she was after his hand.

1:13:24.916 --> 1:13:26.833
Now, that marriage would be a scandal.

1:13:26.916 --> 1:13:29.333
You're concerned
for my father's reputation?

1:13:29.416 --> 1:13:30.875
Oh, no, not at all.

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:35.458
My concern is that he will have a son
and that son will rob me of my title

1:13:35.541 --> 1:13:37.125
and my estate.

1:13:37.208 --> 1:13:40.125
And my plan is to block that
by any means necessary.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.750
I told you,
I'm willing to work for my titles.

1:13:44.750 --> 1:13:48.833
I have to say,
I am impressed by your openness.

1:13:48.916 --> 1:13:50.166
Refreshing, yes?

1:13:52.083 --> 1:13:53.416
I'm so glad to see you again.

1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:57.375
I heard about that terrible accident
that befell your party after I left Lyme.

1:13:58.250 --> 1:13:59.208
How is she?

1:13:59.291 --> 1:14:03.125
She's still confined to her bed,
but much recovered.

1:14:03.208 --> 1:14:05.041
I received word this morning.

1:14:05.125 --> 1:14:06.375
Thank you for asking.

1:14:07.291 --> 1:14:10.541
-You must have suffered terribly.
-I suffered the least, truly.

1:14:11.833 --> 1:14:16.166
You have a gentle soul.
You feel deeply for those around you.

1:14:16.250 --> 1:14:19.250
I imagine it was quite an ordeal.
I regret you had to go through it.

1:14:21.208 --> 1:14:22.125
Thank you.

1:14:27.333 --> 1:14:28.583
So good, darling.

1:14:30.291 --> 1:14:31.125
Mm.

1:14:32.125 --> 1:14:36.000
-Go forth. You have my blessing.
-I wouldn't do anything without it.

1:14:37.541 --> 1:14:38.750
-Bravo!

1:14:38.833 --> 1:14:41.333
Bravo. Very well played, madam.

1:14:44.041 --> 1:14:46.166
He means to disarm me with candor.

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:48.666
It isn't working.

1:14:49.791 --> 1:14:50.750
Yet.

1:14:51.416 --> 1:14:52.500
Probably won't.

1:14:54.083 --> 1:14:54.958
Right?

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:11.333
Ow.

1:15:29.291 --> 1:15:30.833
-What?
-Joy.

1:15:30.916 --> 1:15:33.250
Pardon me, I'm experiencing joy.

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:38.458
The dowager Viscountess Dalrymple
and her daughter,

1:15:38.541 --> 1:15:40.375
the honorable Miss Carteret,

1:15:40.458 --> 1:15:41.958
are in Bath.

1:15:44.333 --> 1:15:46.416
Do you rehearse this stuff
while I'm sleeping?

1:15:46.541 --> 1:15:47.583
Our dear cousins!

1:15:47.666 --> 1:15:49.666
Cousins? I love cousins!

1:15:50.250 --> 1:15:54.583
Cousin is a term most accurately applied
to those within one's family tree,

1:15:54.666 --> 1:15:57.875
not those within one's family forest.

1:15:57.958 --> 1:16:01.333
The Dalrymples don't have
the slightest notion that we exist.

1:16:01.416 --> 1:16:04.166
With the help of a few visual aids,

1:16:04.250 --> 1:16:07.166
I bet we could explain the connections
most comprehensively

1:16:07.791 --> 1:16:09.541
within three quarters of an hour.

1:16:10.125 --> 1:16:11.500
-But why?
-Why?

1:16:11.583 --> 1:16:15.375
These people are nobility.
Everyone will want to be seen with them.

1:16:15.916 --> 1:16:17.708
What's the advantage
of being seen with them?

1:16:18.291 --> 1:16:20.541
Anne, don't be deliberately dense.

1:16:22.833 --> 1:16:25.625
Quick! Break out your finest frocks.

1:16:25.708 --> 1:16:29.250
We are about to touch… greatness.

1:17:30.125 --> 1:17:32.375
Sometimes, I have this dream

1:17:32.958 --> 1:17:37.833
that a giant octopus is sucking my face
and, as I struggle to get free,

1:17:37.916 --> 1:17:41.125
I realize that my, my hands are tentacles

1:17:41.208 --> 1:17:42.333
and I can't push it off.

1:17:42.833 --> 1:17:45.958
And then I realize, of course, that I am

1:17:46.916 --> 1:17:48.791
the octopus, and I am

1:17:50.083 --> 1:17:52.125
sucking my own

1:17:53.583 --> 1:17:54.583
face.

1:18:00.458 --> 1:18:01.416
Much like in life.

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:05.375
So often those we perceive
as our greatest adversaries

1:18:05.458 --> 1:18:07.666
are just shadow versions of ourselves.

1:18:07.750 --> 1:18:08.958
Well put, Mr. Elliot.

1:18:09.458 --> 1:18:10.583
Hmm.

1:18:10.666 --> 1:18:14.333
Perhaps the next time
you meet an octopus, Miss Elliot,

1:18:15.083 --> 1:18:18.125
you should embrace him,
rather than try to detach.

1:18:18.750 --> 1:18:21.833
Wrap those wily tendrils right around him

1:18:21.916 --> 1:18:23.791
and let yourself be taken.

1:18:26.875 --> 1:18:28.458
In your dreams, Mr. Elliot.

1:18:29.458 --> 1:18:31.375
And also in mine.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:36.916
It was on account of eating some cheese

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:38.916
a bit too close to bedtime.

1:18:43.083 --> 1:18:44.958
-Oh.
-Well, that went splendidly.

1:18:45.041 --> 1:18:46.833
I knew it would.

1:18:46.916 --> 1:18:51.958
Your charms are irresistible, Sir Walter,
even to nobility.

1:18:55.291 --> 1:18:57.833
Your noble relations disappoint you.

1:19:01.458 --> 1:19:04.708
That awful woman
cannot marry your father. Ugh.

1:19:06.375 --> 1:19:07.416
Tell me something.

1:19:07.916 --> 1:19:11.125
You'd honestly rather prevent Mrs. Clay
from taking my father's arm

1:19:11.208 --> 1:19:12.666
than talk with me?

1:19:13.666 --> 1:19:16.833
My dear octopus, it's not even close.

1:19:18.583 --> 1:19:19.500
You know…

1:19:22.708 --> 1:19:24.375
you're beginning to grow on me.

1:19:25.291 --> 1:19:26.666
Now I'm suspicious.

1:19:31.375 --> 1:19:32.458
Fascinating.

1:19:36.166 --> 1:19:38.875
Must everyone be interesting?

1:19:38.958 --> 1:19:42.000
Not at all. They are free
to be as boring as they like

1:19:42.083 --> 1:19:44.583
so long as I am not asked
to sit with them.

1:19:46.958 --> 1:19:48.250
And him?

1:19:52.583 --> 1:19:55.833
He provided some relief.
More than I anticipated.

1:19:55.916 --> 1:19:56.916
Hmm.

1:19:57.500 --> 1:19:59.833
He spoke quite highly of you to me
the other night.

1:19:59.916 --> 1:20:02.375
I believe there is some attachment.

1:20:03.125 --> 1:20:06.958
Mr. Elliot could attach to a potato
if it suited him.

1:20:19.541 --> 1:20:23.000
Though Elizabeth may find
some satisfaction living at home forever,

1:20:23.083 --> 1:20:25.333
that life will lock you in deadness.

1:20:26.083 --> 1:20:29.750
All I'm saying is,
I hope you will accept Mr. Elliot

1:20:29.833 --> 1:20:31.625
if he makes an offer.

1:20:32.125 --> 1:20:34.208
Based on your extensive knowledge of him?

1:20:34.791 --> 1:20:39.000
I may not have extensive knowledge of him,
but I have extensive knowledge of you.

1:20:39.583 --> 1:20:43.083
Not only is he rich and well-mannered,

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:46.541
I believe you've taken an interest in him.

1:20:46.625 --> 1:20:49.333
I would never have recommended it
otherwise.

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:54.916
I'll admit, there is something there.

1:20:57.833 --> 1:21:00.750
But, for once, I'm asking you to trust
that I have the resources

1:21:00.833 --> 1:21:02.291
to make my own decisions.

1:21:03.125 --> 1:21:06.041
I must rely on the instructions
issued by my own heart.

1:21:06.125 --> 1:21:09.375
I tried the alternative once
and I'll never forgive myself for it.

1:21:10.333 --> 1:21:12.000
You mean you'll never forgive me.

1:21:18.625 --> 1:21:21.125
I just thought, under the circumstances…

1:21:23.125 --> 1:21:24.166
Circumstances?

1:21:24.916 --> 1:21:27.708
The engagement, of course.
Wentworth and Louisa.

1:21:32.666 --> 1:21:34.041
Oh, I thought you knew.

1:21:35.541 --> 1:21:38.666
Everyone is talking
about Louisa and her captain.

1:21:40.666 --> 1:21:41.958
Oh, darling.

1:21:43.750 --> 1:21:44.708
What can I do?

1:21:47.125 --> 1:21:49.291
I'd just like to be alone.

1:21:52.125 --> 1:21:54.125
Well, I'm here when you want me.

1:22:26.125 --> 1:22:28.291
I always imagined myself

1:22:28.375 --> 1:22:30.000
confronting this moment

1:22:31.875 --> 1:22:32.833
with grace.

1:22:36.625 --> 1:22:39.541
I would astonish myself and others
with my…

1:22:41.083 --> 1:22:42.791
My quiet dignity.

1:22:44.708 --> 1:22:46.583
My ability to endure.

1:22:49.708 --> 1:22:51.541
Statues would be erected in my name.

1:22:52.916 --> 1:22:54.458
"In memory of Anne Elliot,

1:22:55.125 --> 1:22:56.666
who suffered cosmic loss

1:22:57.375 --> 1:23:00.666
yet really held it together
quite impressively."

1:23:44.875 --> 1:23:45.875
Mm.

1:23:53.958 --> 1:23:55.125
Anne.

1:23:58.583 --> 1:24:01.625
-You're here.
-Yes, it appears I am.

1:24:02.791 --> 1:24:04.458
-Are you alone?
-Mm.

1:24:05.916 --> 1:24:07.708
I'm just waiting for a friend.

1:24:08.541 --> 1:24:09.375
I see.

1:24:10.250 --> 1:24:13.083
We got caught in the rain.
He's gone to fetch a carriage.

1:24:14.416 --> 1:24:15.750
He's quite charming.

1:24:16.583 --> 1:24:19.250
-Well, I'm pleased to hear that.
-He makes me laugh.

1:24:19.958 --> 1:24:21.375
It's nice to laugh.

1:24:22.041 --> 1:24:24.541
Apparently, you've yet to hear
about the engagement. I'm--

1:24:24.625 --> 1:24:27.125
I'm sorry, the horses
were a nightmare in the rain.

1:24:29.416 --> 1:24:32.500
-Uh, Mr. Elliot, allow me to introduce--
-We remember each other.

1:24:32.583 --> 1:24:33.541
We do.

1:24:33.625 --> 1:24:34.541
Mm.

1:24:37.541 --> 1:24:39.125
Th-this is Captain Wentworth.

1:24:39.208 --> 1:24:41.833
Yes, your good friend Captain Wentworth.

1:24:42.333 --> 1:24:46.416
I'm glad to have the opportunity
to, uh, apologize for my behavior in Lyme.

1:24:47.125 --> 1:24:49.625
It was on account of being struck by this

1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:52.291
dazzling creature.

1:24:52.375 --> 1:24:54.000
Please don't call me a creature.

1:24:54.666 --> 1:24:56.166
This dazzling, um…

1:24:57.125 --> 1:24:58.583
Woman? Woman?

1:24:58.666 --> 1:25:01.250
-What's wrong with creature?
-We'll talk about it later.

1:25:01.750 --> 1:25:03.625
What is taking you two so long?

1:25:03.708 --> 1:25:06.375
Um, just one second. One second.

1:25:07.041 --> 1:25:09.458
There's a concert tomorrow.
Will you join us?

1:25:09.541 --> 1:25:11.958
-Oh, I'd hate to intrude.
-On what?

1:25:13.208 --> 1:25:15.208
You'll come, then. Excellent.

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:17.875
We'll be a foursome.
You, she, the bel canto and me.

1:25:22.250 --> 1:25:23.750
He's quite original, isn't he?

1:25:24.750 --> 1:25:25.916
Unique, even.

1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:28.750
It's good to see you happy.

1:25:29.250 --> 1:25:30.125
Thanks.

1:25:31.750 --> 1:25:32.958
I hope you're happy too.

1:25:37.291 --> 1:25:39.375
Anne, I think we should be going.

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.125
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:50.208
Anne! Hurry up!

1:26:17.583 --> 1:26:18.416
Good evening.

1:26:21.375 --> 1:26:22.208
Shall we?

1:26:28.958 --> 1:26:30.208
How's Louisa?

1:26:30.291 --> 1:26:31.291
Very much recovered.

1:26:31.958 --> 1:26:33.416
And yet still healing slowly.

1:26:34.125 --> 1:26:36.708
It's going to take time and love
to see her through.

1:26:38.541 --> 1:26:39.375
Good.

1:26:42.333 --> 1:26:45.333
So long as you're in Bath,
I hope we can see a bit of one another.

1:26:45.416 --> 1:26:47.541
I'm actually not sure
how long I'll be here.

1:26:47.625 --> 1:26:51.833
I'm in the throes of a difficult decision.
Been offered a position aboard a ship.

1:26:52.708 --> 1:26:53.541
Oh.

1:26:54.083 --> 1:26:58.541
She sets sail for Malta Saturday,
so I don't have long to make up my mind.

1:26:58.625 --> 1:27:01.208
-Well, that sounds exciting.
-Indeed it does.

1:27:01.791 --> 1:27:04.416
I love my work and I'm happy
for the opportunity to serve, but--

1:27:04.500 --> 1:27:08.583
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to steal my Anne for a moment.

1:27:09.416 --> 1:27:11.750
Fluent in Italian too,
would you believe it?

1:27:11.833 --> 1:27:14.958
-Uh, we need help translating the program.
-Just one moment.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:19.250
Anne, we need you to do Italian
for our cousins.

1:27:28.708 --> 1:27:31.208
I do hope you'll be able
to make it to the wedding.

1:27:33.541 --> 1:27:35.833
Anne would be devastated
if you weren't there.

1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:39.875
I know how much
she values your friendship.

1:29:36.791 --> 1:29:37.625
Frederick!

1:29:39.166 --> 1:29:42.958
I was hoping we could continue
our conversation.

1:29:43.541 --> 1:29:45.625
Sadly, I'm not sure
there will be another opportunity.

1:29:47.833 --> 1:29:52.583
I've just made up my mind. I'm off to sea.
Much to put in order before Saturday.

1:29:53.125 --> 1:29:55.166
I'm sorry, I'm interrupting again.

1:29:55.250 --> 1:29:57.750
No, no, no.
I'm afraid it is I who is interrupting.

1:30:01.125 --> 1:30:02.208
Enjoy the second act.

1:30:03.708 --> 1:30:04.666
We will.

1:30:06.458 --> 1:30:09.250
-I didn't mean to upset--
-If you would just let me speak.

1:30:09.333 --> 1:30:13.583
You interrupted me.
Let me say what's on my mind first.

1:30:14.916 --> 1:30:17.583
I'm new to these genuine feelings.

1:30:18.375 --> 1:30:20.625
I'm trying to learn from you, for you.

1:30:21.166 --> 1:30:23.875
You're far too good for me
and I'm terrified.

1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:28.250
But I want very much to make you my wife.

1:30:28.833 --> 1:30:30.583
Nothing else would make me happier.

1:30:34.250 --> 1:30:37.333
-Your wife?
-Yes. You don't have to answer now.

1:30:38.541 --> 1:30:40.416
But please, think on it.

1:30:45.625 --> 1:30:47.541
The captain was right, you know.

1:30:49.750 --> 1:30:52.250
The gentleman is indeed unique.

1:31:13.958 --> 1:31:14.791
Ow.

1:31:15.458 --> 1:31:16.583
Charles, hurry up!

1:31:21.041 --> 1:31:21.875
Ow.

1:31:22.666 --> 1:31:23.500
Ow.

1:31:26.333 --> 1:31:28.541
The journey gave me dead leg.
I need you to massage it.

1:31:28.625 --> 1:31:30.375
Mary, what are you doing here?

1:31:30.458 --> 1:31:32.208
Uh, coming to fetch you, of course.

1:31:33.041 --> 1:31:35.875
You need to come to the inn
with Charles and me to listen to me talk.

1:31:36.375 --> 1:31:37.750
We're here for a little visit.

1:31:38.750 --> 1:31:43.625
Ever since Louisa's accident,
life just seems so fragile and fleeting.

1:31:44.750 --> 1:31:48.125
It's made me realize how important it is
to spend time away from one's children.

1:31:49.208 --> 1:31:52.708
And it's dreadfully unfair that you
and Elizabeth are up here gallivanting

1:31:52.791 --> 1:31:54.583
with Mr. Elliot and our noble cousins

1:31:54.666 --> 1:31:56.541
and I haven't even been introduced
to them yet,

1:31:57.041 --> 1:32:00.958
despite being the most accomplished
decoupage artist of the three of us. Hmm?

1:32:04.375 --> 1:32:05.625
Oh, Anne, have you heard?

1:32:06.166 --> 1:32:07.708
Louisa will marry a sailor

1:32:07.791 --> 1:32:11.166
and Henrietta that soiled napkin
of a curate, Henry Hayter.

1:32:11.250 --> 1:32:12.750
Mary, remember your list.

1:32:12.833 --> 1:32:14.041
Oh, right.

1:32:14.916 --> 1:32:19.250
My doctor thinks I might benefit
from embodying gratitude.

1:32:20.208 --> 1:32:22.333
So every time something terrible
happens in my life,

1:32:22.416 --> 1:32:24.000
I'm to think up something I'm glad for.

1:32:24.083 --> 1:32:27.708
For example, the fact that both my sisters
are madly in love and about to be married?

1:32:29.375 --> 1:32:31.083
No, that does nothing for me.

1:32:31.166 --> 1:32:33.333
Well, I'm delighted for them both.

1:32:33.916 --> 1:32:35.541
And I will come and visit later.

1:32:36.416 --> 1:32:38.333
-Where are you going?
-Um…

1:32:38.416 --> 1:32:40.250
I have plans.

1:32:42.541 --> 1:32:43.583
What plans?

1:32:44.458 --> 1:32:49.500
Upstairs? You don't even have any friends
and all your relations are in this house.

1:32:49.583 --> 1:32:53.333
I hate to agree with my wife, Anne,
but I've been given explicit instructions

1:32:53.416 --> 1:32:56.666
not to return to the inn without you.
It'll be a little Lyme reunion.

1:32:58.416 --> 1:33:01.625
Captain Harville was quite charmed by you
and delighted for the prospect

1:33:01.708 --> 1:33:03.208
of renewing your acquaintance.

1:33:03.291 --> 1:33:04.833
He's gone to fetch Wentworth just now.

1:33:05.916 --> 1:33:08.291
How unfortunate you have other plans.

1:33:22.666 --> 1:33:23.583
Anne.

1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:26.500
I've missed you.

1:33:26.583 --> 1:33:29.666
We need to give Wentworth
a proper send-off.

1:33:29.750 --> 1:33:33.500
Absolutely.
A few drinks, a game of cards.

1:33:34.125 --> 1:33:36.458
Although I understand
Anne has other plans.

1:33:37.041 --> 1:33:38.250
I'm no card player.

1:33:38.333 --> 1:33:39.416
Worst I've ever seen.

1:33:42.666 --> 1:33:45.291
That was then. Time makes many changes.

1:33:45.375 --> 1:33:47.125
I'm not yet so much changed.

1:33:49.250 --> 1:33:51.166
Wentworth, sorry to interrupt
but I will not rest

1:33:51.250 --> 1:33:54.000
until that letter is signed
and delivered to Admiral Croft.

1:33:54.083 --> 1:33:56.958
You've been very slippery
these past few months.

1:33:57.041 --> 1:33:57.875
Of course.

1:34:05.958 --> 1:34:06.916
Are we finished?

1:34:08.708 --> 1:34:09.708
I suppose so.

1:34:15.250 --> 1:34:16.375
I'll be just a moment.

1:34:25.416 --> 1:34:27.291
You look a bit sad, Captain Harville.

1:34:28.375 --> 1:34:29.958
Well, actually, I should be happy.

1:34:30.458 --> 1:34:32.666
Captain Benwick has found love at last.

1:34:33.166 --> 1:34:36.875
That's wonderful.
I should think you would be pleased.

1:34:36.958 --> 1:34:39.416
You were so determined
to see him out of his misery.

1:34:39.916 --> 1:34:43.541
But I hadn't anticipated
the effect it would have on me.

1:34:44.416 --> 1:34:48.500
It's as if his suffering
was keeping my sister alive somehow.

1:34:50.708 --> 1:34:53.708
Poor Fanny. She would never
have forgotten him so soon.

1:34:54.208 --> 1:34:55.916
Well, that's certain.

1:34:56.708 --> 1:34:59.750
We women do not forget you
so soon as you forget us.

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.625
Women love beyond all sensible limits.

1:35:04.666 --> 1:35:06.333
We cannot help ourselves.

1:35:06.916 --> 1:35:10.750
I don't mean to venture any claims about
the differences between men and women.

1:35:10.833 --> 1:35:12.375
Oh, well, I will.

1:35:12.458 --> 1:35:16.166
The only privilege I claim for my sex
is that of loving longest.

1:35:16.958 --> 1:35:20.916
Loving even when hope is gone.

1:35:22.541 --> 1:35:25.125
Loving because you don't have a choice.

1:35:31.666 --> 1:35:34.000
-I'm finished.
-Thank you.

1:35:45.625 --> 1:35:47.291
There is no quarreling with you.

1:35:48.750 --> 1:35:52.958
I think Fanny would be happy
to see her Benwick cared for.

1:35:53.041 --> 1:35:55.208
Fanny was never
the jealous type.

1:35:55.291 --> 1:35:58.500
In moments I've wondered if it wasn't
my sister's spirit in the wind

1:35:58.583 --> 1:35:59.958
that caused Louisa to slip,

1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:03.041
knowing somehow
eventually where she would land.

1:36:04.041 --> 1:36:04.958
Louisa?

1:36:07.625 --> 1:36:08.500
I've told you,

1:36:09.458 --> 1:36:12.583
the universe has perfect timing.

1:36:13.125 --> 1:36:17.000
And when you had the presence of mind
to tell Benwick to fetch a surgeon,

1:36:17.083 --> 1:36:20.250
you must have had no idea the wheels
that you were setting in motion.

1:36:20.750 --> 1:36:22.708
Captain, I'm afraid I'm lost.

1:36:23.250 --> 1:36:26.208
I'm speaking of Louisa's engagement
to Captain Benwick, of course.

1:36:26.291 --> 1:36:28.125
A love grown slow and sure

1:36:28.208 --> 1:36:31.166
from his constant attention
to her during her convalescence.

1:36:33.125 --> 1:36:35.000
Of what did you think I was speaking?

1:36:36.291 --> 1:36:37.208
I don't know.

1:36:38.916 --> 1:36:41.583
I'll make sure
this letter gets to Admiral Croft.

1:37:09.208 --> 1:37:10.083
"Dear Anne…"

1:37:14.708 --> 1:37:16.666
"…I can listen no longer in silence."

1:37:17.541 --> 1:37:20.541
"Anne, you pierce my soul."

1:37:21.875 --> 1:37:24.333
"Dare not say
that man forgets sooner than woman,

1:37:25.875 --> 1:37:27.708
that his love has an earlier death."

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:32.250
"I am half agony, half hope."

1:37:33.375 --> 1:37:35.000
"I know you are to marry Mr. Elliot,

1:37:35.083 --> 1:37:37.625
but I will never forgive myself
if I do not tell you this."

1:37:39.291 --> 1:37:41.500
"You alone have brought me to Bath."

1:37:41.583 --> 1:37:43.583
"For you alone I think and plan."

1:37:45.791 --> 1:37:48.458
"But of course you have not seen this.
How could you?"

1:37:51.958 --> 1:37:54.458
"Because your love has not lasted
as long as mine."

1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:57.833
"Anne…

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.541
I have loved no one but you."

1:38:04.416 --> 1:38:06.041
"And I don't think I ever will."

1:38:24.166 --> 1:38:25.250
Anne.

1:38:27.041 --> 1:38:30.333
-I can explain--
-I wish you both every happiness.

1:38:40.083 --> 1:38:42.416
"I have thought many times
about how to tell you,

1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.916
but the pain of a love unrequited
rendered me silent."

1:38:47.291 --> 1:38:49.250
"Tell me not that I am too late."

1:38:50.333 --> 1:38:51.166
Frederick!

1:38:52.750 --> 1:38:55.583
"My love for you
has never faltered."

Right, lined up.

We would normally take a note of that.
