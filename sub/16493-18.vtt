00:05.206 --> 00:07.206
Have they even issued
last month's check?

00:07.289 --> 00:09.872
I haven't seen one.
Just keep an eye out for the landlord.

00:09.914 --> 00:11.914
Hey! Rent!

00:11.998 --> 00:13.872
You two owe me rent.
Get back here!

00:13.956 --> 00:15.497
Hey, I see you two. Hey, rent!

00:16.289 --> 00:17.372
[door knock]

00:17.455 --> 00:20.455
I didn't fight the five wars
to take this from you two.

00:20.539 --> 00:22.497
I better see rent by Tuesday.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.248
[both] Yes, Mr. Phillips.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.872
That guy really scares me.

00:26.956 --> 00:28.455
Well,
I guess we better check in.

00:35.206 --> 00:37.914
Your time is not
terribly important to us.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.998
Ugh,
it's Cooperdink and Hampshire.

00:41.081 --> 00:42.664
It's Cavendish and Dakota, sir.

00:42.747 --> 00:43.956
Sure it is.

00:44.039 --> 00:45.289
Is it winter there?

00:45.372 --> 00:46.330
No, not today.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.664
But I went back six months
to see a movie I missed.

00:48.747 --> 00:49.664
Ooh, which one?

00:49.747 --> 00:51.914
None of your
business, part two...

00:51.956 --> 00:53.539
The shut-upening.

00:53.622 --> 00:56.206
Your mission is
the pistachio farm.

00:56.289 --> 00:59.039
Drive support stakes into
the ground near each plant.

00:59.123 --> 01:00.706
There's a map and some
stakes in your locker.

01:04.123 --> 01:05.914
Gretchen! The map and stakes.

01:05.998 --> 01:07.039
Just a sec.

01:07.123 --> 01:09.455
You were supposed
to do it yesterday.

01:09.539 --> 01:11.248
I am doing it yesterday.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.580
[thudding]

01:14.580 --> 01:17.164
What about this Milo Murphy, sir?

01:17.248 --> 01:19.123
Have you found out what
agency he's working for?

01:19.206 --> 01:21.039
There is no other agency.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.330
I told you,
he's just a middle-schooler.

01:23.414 --> 01:25.081
Yes, but he's thwarted our
pistachio mission, repeatedly.

01:25.164 --> 01:27.539
He's definitely
working for someone.

01:27.622 --> 01:30.539
Unless, you have some evidence,
stick to your mission!

01:30.622 --> 01:32.164
Hmm, evidence.

01:32.248 --> 01:33.206
Now, if you will excuse me,

01:33.289 --> 01:35.414
I have to go back
to 20 seconds ago.

Ugh, it's Cooperdink and Hampshire.

That never ceases to be
amusing, sir.

-[monitor beeps]
-I'm Hampshire, right?

01:44.455 --> 01:46.580
'Cause that hat and goggles
definitely say Cooperdink.

01:46.664 --> 01:48.998
The important thing is that we
now have permission to collect

01:49.081 --> 01:50.455
evidence on Milo Murphy.

01:50.539 --> 01:53.664
-Is that what you got from that?
-Yes, that's what I got from it.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.998

covering that for me.

going smoothly, I will have fun.

If I waited for things to go
smoothly to have fun, I'd be...

Milo, please try to keep your
distance from the decorations,

02:30.872 --> 02:32.622
food, stage, ice sculptures,

02:32.706 --> 02:35.289

some undercover agent stuff

03:17.747 --> 03:19.289

03:19.372 --> 03:20.747
Is that your theory?

03:20.831 --> 03:23.580
What better cover is there?
No one, but an idiot would suspect it.

03:23.664 --> 03:24.872
I didn't say it.

03:24.956 --> 03:28.039
And plus, we're carrying around
wooden stakes at a party,

03:28.123 --> 03:30.289
and not the kind of party where
wooden stakes would be appropriate.

03:30.372 --> 03:33.164
And what sort of
party would that be?

03:33.248 --> 03:35.330
If we were at one,
I'm assuming we would know.

Perhaps, we should ask
someone about this Murphy.

Why don't we ask
Murphy about Murphy?

here, ladling punch?

What if it's blood?

when I left the house.

little natural light,

box that I sleep in.

This is what I was afraid of.
They're after Mr. Draco.

If he's really a vampire,
those wooden stakes will kill him.

05:29.289 --> 05:32.539
But if he's not a vampire,
those wooden stakes will kill him.

05:32.622 --> 05:35.248
We could tell Principal Milder
that vampire hunters have...

05:35.330 --> 05:38.289
Never mind.
I'm hearing it as I'm saying it.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.289
If they want Draco,
they'll have to go through us.

He maybe a vampire,
which I still maintain he's not,

05:42.539 --> 05:45.330

which I still maintain he's not.

Ugh, so, you did not complete
the mission you were assigned

09:53.622 --> 09:56.497
and instead you went to
a middle-school dance.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.580
That's not precisely
what I said...

09:58.664 --> 10:00.539
But it's basically what we did.

10:00.622 --> 10:01.580
[sighs] Ignoring for the moment,

10:01.664 --> 10:04.081
this direct violation
of your orders,

10:04.164 --> 10:06.497
do you have anything
of note to report?

10:06.580 --> 10:08.081
Yeah, get a load of this.

10:08.164 --> 10:10.455
There's this one teacher at
the school who looks exactly...

10:10.539 --> 10:11.706
Tell me if I'm right.
Like a "vampire".

10:11.789 --> 10:13.164
-Right. Yes.
-He does.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.789
I may have a picture in my...

10:17.872 --> 10:20.580
Do you want to explain
where these kids came from?

10:20.664 --> 10:22.580
Uh, are we still getting
paid for this gig?
