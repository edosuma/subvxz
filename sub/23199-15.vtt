00:27.136 --> 00:29.263
All right, men, take it in.

01:58.685 --> 02:02.522
Well, again we have defied
the laws of nature.

02:03.106 --> 02:06.693
We have turned base metal
into precious gold.

02:07.944 --> 02:09.571
You are late, Morgana.

02:09.654 --> 02:13.366
Perhaps, Count Cagliostro.
But I have fulfilled my mission.

02:13.616 --> 02:14.868
I see.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.959
And Diana Prince still has the pendant?

02:24.836 --> 02:26.546
Nimler, that Judas.

02:26.629 --> 02:29.674
He sent it to her
in order to expose what I'm doing.

02:29.757 --> 02:31.009
Nimler is dead.

02:31.092 --> 02:33.469
We have no way of knowing
if it was him or not.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.014
Nor do we know
what else he may have told her...

02:36.097 --> 02:38.349
which is why we must move quickly.

02:38.433 --> 02:41.978
Bring me the pendant
and bring me Diana Prince.

02:49.110 --> 02:50.736
Take another in.

04:19.616 --> 04:22.911
Will the bell captain
please report to the front desk?

04:31.545 --> 04:35.090
Mr. Robert Hudson,
you have a message at the front desk.

04:36.425 --> 04:40.178
Miss Prince,
His Serene Exalted Highness...

04:40.387 --> 04:43.640
Mustafa ben Hassim, the Emir of Quiana.

04:44.975 --> 04:47.435
I am humbled by your beauty.

04:49.396 --> 04:51.314
No more than I am humbled...

04:51.398 --> 04:54.568
by meeting one of the most powerful men
in the world.

04:54.651 --> 04:58.029
An exaggeration.
Of course, not entirely untrue.

04:58.113 --> 05:02.492
Then it is true that the oil countries
take their cue from you?

05:02.742 --> 05:06.746
Beautiful woman wishes to discuss
the worldwide price of oil?

05:06.830 --> 05:10.792
You've got to realize that the world
couldn't afford prices like that...

05:10.875 --> 05:13.586
and it could cause an economic disaster.

05:14.170 --> 05:16.047
Your Serene Highness.

05:20.510 --> 05:23.638
- We shall talk later.
- Yes, we shall.

05:26.224 --> 05:28.351
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

05:31.688 --> 05:33.523
I think that's a real bummer.

05:33.606 --> 05:35.275
The IADC has no right...

05:35.358 --> 05:38.194
making you butter up
to a 24 karat yuck like that emir.

05:38.278 --> 05:40.863
I think you've got me confused
with somebody else.

05:40.947 --> 05:44.200
You have me confused all the time,
but not about who you are.

05:44.283 --> 05:47.120
You're Diana Prince, the spy from IADC.

05:47.203 --> 05:50.123
That sound we just heard,
that was you blasting my cover.

05:50.206 --> 05:53.126
Tonight, I'm supposed to be
just a pretty face, thank you.

05:53.209 --> 05:57.338
Honorable guests, for your amusement,
we present a maestro of magic.

05:57.547 --> 06:00.675
He'll be appearing later this week
at this fine hotel...

06:00.758 --> 06:04.595
as part of the International Symposium
for the Conjuring Arts.

06:04.762 --> 06:08.349
But for now,
come gather for Jazreel the Great.

06:09.350 --> 06:12.687
My name is Harold Farnum.
My dad's Congressman Farnum.

06:12.770 --> 06:15.898
I came here tonight just to meet you.
Would you like a drink?

06:15.982 --> 06:17.733
Well, actually...

06:22.238 --> 06:23.781
Jeez, I'm sorry.

06:24.448 --> 06:28.160
That's all right. I wasn't thirsty, anyway.

06:28.411 --> 06:32.289
I really wanted that trick to work.
I thought it'd break the ice between us.

06:32.373 --> 06:33.541
"Us"?

06:33.791 --> 06:36.710
I've been dying to meet you
since you moved to the block.

06:36.794 --> 06:38.587
I live at Number 73.

06:40.172 --> 06:41.674
That's nice.

07:03.695 --> 07:05.280
See you in the neighborhood.

07:05.364 --> 07:07.574
Are you here on assignment? Can I help?

07:07.658 --> 07:09.785
Somebody you want tailed,
documents copied?

07:09.868 --> 07:12.454
Nimble-fingered Farnum, they call me.

07:17.960 --> 07:21.463
Thank you, Harold.
If I need you, I'll call you, okay?

07:45.821 --> 07:50.367
For my first demonstration, I will need
the assistance of a beautiful young lady.

07:57.666 --> 08:01.461
Mademoiselle, would you mind
if I made you disappear?

08:03.129 --> 08:06.466
Go ahead, Miss Prince.
You can't get hurt. It's an old trick.

08:15.517 --> 08:18.061
Mesdames et messieurs...

08:19.187 --> 08:21.314
the magic chamber is empty.

08:22.107 --> 08:24.734
Solid. No false doors.

08:26.569 --> 08:28.613
Mademoiselle, if you will.

08:36.203 --> 08:39.123
I shall say the magic words,
and before your very eyes...

08:39.207 --> 08:42.751
this beautiful young lady
will disappear into thin air.

08:59.185 --> 09:02.271
She's wearing the pendant.
Get her out of here.

09:22.166 --> 09:26.045
And now it is time to summon
our beautiful young friend back to us.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.887
You must know what happened
to the magician.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.430
And where is Miss Prince?

11:00.514 --> 11:02.807
Young man,
I implore you to temper your remarks.

11:02.891 --> 11:05.644
I won't temper anything
until you tell me what happened.

11:05.727 --> 11:07.145
I know how that trick works...

11:07.229 --> 11:09.940
and I want to go into your basement
and see for myself.

11:10.023 --> 11:13.068
- You can save yourself the trip.
- You're okay. I was worried.

11:13.151 --> 11:16.321
You're a magician. You should know
I'd turn up sooner or later.

11:16.404 --> 11:18.323
I'd like to speak with Jazreel.

11:18.406 --> 11:21.951
He has performed a true feat of magic.
He has made himself disappear.

11:22.035 --> 11:24.204
My men looked for him everywhere.

11:24.370 --> 11:28.208
Well, Your Excellency,
I appreciate your trouble.

11:29.042 --> 11:30.502
Thank you.

11:32.253 --> 11:35.256
Mr. Gate, please call the operator.

11:39.344 --> 11:41.888
This is what the magician was after?

11:42.722 --> 11:44.390
That's what Diana said.

11:44.474 --> 11:46.684
It was mailed to her less than a week ago.

11:46.768 --> 11:48.978
She's checking out the box it came in.

11:49.062 --> 11:53.024
It looks ordinary enough to me.
Maybe I ought to have it analyzed.

11:53.107 --> 11:55.526
Would you like me to run it over
to Dr. Hutchins?

11:55.610 --> 11:58.488
- Very nice, if you would. Thank you.
- Well, I don't know.

11:58.571 --> 12:01.824
You sent Diana to find out
what the oil producers were up to...

12:01.908 --> 12:03.576
and she almost wound up kidnapped.

12:03.659 --> 12:06.871
That's true.
Stay away from anybody selling oil.

12:06.954 --> 12:09.874
It's the ones carrying the magic wands
that worry me.

12:13.461 --> 12:16.214
Have you all turned against me?
Where is Diana Prince?

12:16.297 --> 12:17.882
Count, we followed your orders.

12:17.965 --> 12:21.344
The driver swears Wonder Woman
tore open the crate and got her out.

12:21.427 --> 12:24.972
We have less than 48 hours
before I'm to deliver the gold to my buyer.

12:25.056 --> 12:27.308
We're prepared to do
whatever you ask, maestro.

12:35.566 --> 12:39.487
All we know for sure is someone is after it,
and in a big way.

12:39.570 --> 12:42.406
If the problem lies in
the analysis of this pendant...

12:42.490 --> 12:44.283
you can rest assured I'll find it.

12:44.366 --> 12:45.743
That's why we came to you.

12:45.826 --> 12:49.038
After all, they don't give Nobel Prizes
for attendance records.

12:49.121 --> 12:52.082
Or modesty.
Call Diana the minute you find something.

12:52.166 --> 12:56.253
Then she'd better stay close to the phone.
I doubt if this will take me long.

12:56.337 --> 12:59.089
That's why we came to you, Dr. Hutchins.

13:29.995 --> 13:33.790
Same address: "Falconi's House of Magic. "

13:35.167 --> 13:38.587
The merchandise here is
competitively priced, not too high or low.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.589
Harold, have you been following me?

13:40.672 --> 13:42.591
You mean, have I been tailing you.

13:42.674 --> 13:45.344
You can say that stuff.
I know all the jargon.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.930
Yes, I have been tailing you.
Frankly, I was worried.

13:49.014 --> 13:51.516
That magician at the hotel
was up to something...

13:51.600 --> 13:53.643
that isn't in any of the books I've read.

13:53.727 --> 13:57.856
I really do appreciate your concern,
but as you can see, I'm okay.

13:58.523 --> 13:59.983
You sure are.

14:01.151 --> 14:03.862
Harold, I'm fine. So you can go home.

14:04.196 --> 14:05.989
Please, I'm already here.

14:06.072 --> 14:08.658
If you're investigating this store,
maybe I can help.

14:08.742 --> 14:10.994
- Remember, I am an expert.
- Okay.

14:11.077 --> 14:12.829
Somehow, I do get the feeling...

14:12.913 --> 14:16.583
that I'd be better off
knowing exactly where you are. Let's go.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.342
What about the address in the box?

14:25.425 --> 14:27.177
Sorry, it doesn't mean a thing.

14:27.260 --> 14:31.973
This place has been Falconi's House
of Magic now for 20, 25 years.

14:32.056 --> 14:35.518
I've bought cards here, Chinese boxes.
Even trick hats.

14:35.643 --> 14:37.187
Speaking of which...

14:37.479 --> 14:39.355
The box means nothing to you?

14:39.439 --> 14:42.150
I'll ask around. You like that trick?

14:42.442 --> 14:46.154
Yeah, I sure do.
That's the longest streamer I've ever seen.

14:46.237 --> 14:49.157
- I'll make you a good deal.
- I may just have to take it.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.576
What about the name Goldblatt?

14:51.868 --> 14:53.661
Sorry. I can't help you.

14:53.745 --> 14:56.914
Just a second. I would like the box back,
if you don't mind.

14:56.998 --> 14:59.208
- Sorry.
- I'm sure.

14:59.292 --> 15:01.794
I've seen too many disappearing acts,
as it is.

15:01.878 --> 15:04.047
Thank you very much. Come on.

15:04.589 --> 15:06.424
Just a second, Diana.

15:10.595 --> 15:11.846
Coming.

16:52.988 --> 16:54.656
What's he gonna do now?

17:41.536 --> 17:45.331
Diana Prince, please.
This is Dr. Hutchins at the University.

17:45.707 --> 17:48.376
It is imperative that I speak with her.

17:49.711 --> 17:51.921
No, she wouldn't want me
to leave a message.

17:52.005 --> 17:55.425
Just tell her that I found
some very startling test results.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.802
I'm on my way to your headquarters.

18:07.603 --> 18:11.065
The undergraduate level
is down the hall and on your left.

18:36.674 --> 18:39.802
I'm sorry,
I really don't have time for this right now.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.973
No, I'm sorry.
I don't have any spare change.

18:45.224 --> 18:46.934
You brought your own.

18:51.188 --> 18:52.815
Case of inflation.

18:54.442 --> 18:56.652
I'm sorry. I've really got to go.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.529
All right, one more.

19:42.906 --> 19:44.866
All right, man! His face.

19:47.995 --> 19:51.498
- That looks like Prof. Hutchins.
- I think you're right.

20:31.579 --> 20:33.999
He did leave word
that his results were startling.

20:34.082 --> 20:36.668
They must have been more than that
if he burned them.

20:36.751 --> 20:40.296
We can't be sure these are his notes.
They're almost completely burned.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.257
The way we've torn up Hutchins' lab...

20:42.340 --> 20:45.468
we're going to seem foolish
if he shows up all of a sudden.

20:45.552 --> 20:48.805
Look, he was due
at the IADC Headquarters yesterday.

20:48.888 --> 20:51.891
His car is still in the parking lot
and nobody can find him.

20:51.975 --> 20:54.894
Chances are, he may never show up.
Bob, take care of that.

20:54.978 --> 20:56.896
Did you find anything in the files?

20:56.980 --> 20:59.941
Lots of good things on Hutchins
and fan mail.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.317
Fan mail?

21:01.401 --> 21:03.903
Did you know that
scientists have groupies?

21:03.987 --> 21:05.613
Not till I met Hutchins.

21:05.697 --> 21:08.741
I might have found something outside,
but I'm not sure.

21:08.825 --> 21:12.161
A student swears that he saw Hutchins
performing in a mime troupe.

21:12.245 --> 21:15.206
- Hutchins was performing?
- That's what the student swears.

21:15.289 --> 21:18.334
With a guy and a girl.
And the guy was a magician.

21:18.418 --> 21:19.544
A magician.

21:19.627 --> 21:23.464
With a white face, and I think he said
he had a battered top hat.

21:24.465 --> 21:25.925
Where's the troupe now?

21:26.008 --> 21:29.178
Off campus somewhere, I guess.
I didn't see them.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.556
Call Diana and have her track them down.

21:31.639 --> 21:34.684
Maybe the magician is the same one
that was at the reception.

21:34.767 --> 21:37.895
Tell her that wherever Hutchins is,
he must have the pendant...

21:37.979 --> 21:39.730
- because it isn't here.
- Okay.

22:24.817 --> 22:28.654
You don't know what an honor it is
to have you as my guest, Dr. Hutchins.

22:28.737 --> 22:30.823
I demand that you let me go!

22:30.906 --> 22:34.618
Your work in metallurgical fusion
was an inspiration to us.

22:34.827 --> 22:39.331
Your re-synthesizing process
was a keystone of our own humble efforts.

22:39.414 --> 22:42.042
I warn you,
I'll see that it goes hard with you.

22:42.125 --> 22:45.462
The pendant that was given
to Diana Prince, where is it?

22:46.088 --> 22:47.881
You'll get nothing from me.

22:47.965 --> 22:51.468
Time is running out, Doctor.
For both of us.

22:51.552 --> 22:54.137
You shall tell me what I want to know.

22:54.221 --> 22:56.890
I'll give you nothing. Nothing at all.

22:57.432 --> 23:00.352
I see. So you force my hand.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.522
Perhaps it's just as well.

23:03.605 --> 23:06.024
It has been some time, Dr. Hutchins...

23:06.108 --> 23:09.986
since we had a customer
in our little Chamber of Horrors.

23:21.039 --> 23:25.961
Attention, please. The Magic Symposium
Will be held in the living room at 8:00.

23:28.588 --> 23:30.215
"Conjuring Arts"?

23:30.298 --> 23:33.551
To be specific,
conjuring is the art we practice.

23:33.635 --> 23:36.304
The term "magic"
can even be applied to witchcraft.

23:36.388 --> 23:37.722
I'll try to remember.

23:37.806 --> 23:39.974
If you have any other questions,
just ask me.

23:40.058 --> 23:42.519
I am your consultant on this case,
after all.

23:42.602 --> 23:46.648
Harold, I only thought that you'd be able
to help me find that mime magician...

23:46.731 --> 23:48.566
who may have kidnapped Dr. Hutchins.

23:48.650 --> 23:52.028
I really didn't think that
we'd wind up at a symposium.

23:52.112 --> 23:54.656
But every magician for 500 miles is here.

23:54.739 --> 23:58.868
I know. Unfortunately,
finding needles in haystacks isn't my forte.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.629
- That's Morgana La Fay.
- I know.

24:19.472 --> 24:23.101
But somehow I don't think
she's the street mime we're looking for.

24:23.184 --> 24:27.230
I used to be so in love with her.
But that was before I met you.

24:31.192 --> 24:34.946
You're going to hyperventilate,
and if you faint I'll have to carry you.

24:35.029 --> 24:36.656
I know you're on spy business...

24:36.739 --> 24:40.284
but I hope we're here long enough
to catch the great Count Cagliostro.

24:42.787 --> 24:45.623
- I thought he quit performing.
- Cagliostro?

24:46.832 --> 24:49.377
- No, it couldn't be...
- Diana?

24:50.711 --> 24:55.091
It's just that I remember
200 or 300 years ago, a man I read about...

24:57.259 --> 24:59.595
Cagliostro from the 18th century.

25:17.988 --> 25:19.281
Come in.

25:20.866 --> 25:25.663
Maestro, are you sure you should
allow yourself this public appearance?

25:26.246 --> 25:27.581
My dear Morgana...

25:27.665 --> 25:31.502
if I were not to perform for my colleagues,
it would only arouse suspicion.

25:31.585 --> 25:34.171
You have the information
I obtained from Hutchins?

25:34.254 --> 25:36.256
I know where the safe is, yes.

25:38.509 --> 25:41.887
Then use this to open it
and bring the pendant to me.

25:41.970 --> 25:44.932
Take care with that. It is highly explosive.

25:45.182 --> 25:48.685
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was very magnificent.

25:48.769 --> 25:50.771
They're waiting for you.

25:57.069 --> 26:00.238
Diana, I think the guy
with the battered hat could be here.

26:00.322 --> 26:02.157
Okay. Now, listen.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.535
You watch the magician,
and I'll watch the audience, okay?

26:18.882 --> 26:21.218
Thank you. And now...

26:21.384 --> 26:25.096
I would like to ask this volunteer
to come up from the audience...

26:25.180 --> 26:29.309
and load this revolver
with three silver bullets.

26:30.769 --> 26:34.898
He will attest to the fact that
they are real bullets, not blanks.

26:35.732 --> 26:37.901
Distinguished members of this body...

26:37.984 --> 26:41.196
have already examined the bottles.

26:41.279 --> 26:42.864
- Is it loaded?
- Yes.

26:42.947 --> 26:45.575
Would you hand it to the lady, please?

26:45.950 --> 26:50.246
Thank you.
Morgana, I await your pleasure.

26:51.122 --> 26:55.668
Now take careful aim, lest it be
the last time we perform this trick.

26:57.754 --> 27:00.131
You know what the targets are.

27:01.758 --> 27:03.593
On the count of three.

27:07.972 --> 27:12.268
One, two, three.

28:26.967 --> 28:29.470
Stay away from me.
There's a bomb in here.

29:26.401 --> 29:28.361
You must tell the truth.

29:30.739 --> 29:33.074
All right, now where is Dr. Hutchins?

29:33.950 --> 29:35.452
I don't know.

29:35.869 --> 29:39.831
- Cagliostro didn't tell me.
- Cagliostro? He's behind this?

29:39.915 --> 29:42.417
I receive my instructions from him.

29:42.792 --> 29:46.379
- He gave me the explosives.
- What were you going to do with those?

29:46.463 --> 29:50.592
Open the safe in Hutchins' lab
and remove the pendant.

29:50.842 --> 29:53.470
Why? What does Cagliostro want
with the pendant?

29:53.553 --> 29:55.013
I don't know.

29:56.431 --> 29:57.766
Where is the safe?

29:57.849 --> 30:00.602
Behind the north wall in the laboratory.

30:01.019 --> 30:03.772
In 10 seconds, go inside...

30:03.855 --> 30:07.066
call the police,
and surrender yourself to them.

30:22.540 --> 30:24.125
Your Highness.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.586
You're late.

30:26.961 --> 30:29.213
I had a previous engagement.

30:29.630 --> 30:32.467
Are you prepared to deliver the gold
you promised us?

30:32.550 --> 30:35.470
Do you speak for yourself,
or for the other heads of state?

30:35.553 --> 30:38.639
Are all the oil-producing nations
in agreement?

30:38.723 --> 30:41.225
Do you know what you're forcing us to do?

30:41.309 --> 30:44.645
We have to raise the price of oil
to buy your gold.

30:44.979 --> 30:47.982
I don't think the world
can meet our demands.

30:48.566 --> 30:51.569
Then forget about
my silly little ingots of solid gold...

30:51.652 --> 30:55.990
which I'm making available to you
at less than half the current market price.

30:56.616 --> 30:58.951
Don't delude yourself or me, Emir.

30:59.035 --> 31:02.622
You and your friends are willing
to jeopardize the world's economy...

31:02.705 --> 31:05.374
in order to line your vaults with gold.

31:05.708 --> 31:08.085
Let your avarice be your guide.

31:08.878 --> 31:11.422
It is agreed. You agreed. We agreed.

31:12.173 --> 31:13.799
And the payments?

31:14.049 --> 31:15.926
Down payment of $10 million...

31:16.010 --> 31:19.054
has been deposited in your account
in Switzerland.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.681
I am a man of honor.

31:20.764 --> 31:24.268
You shall have the gold within two days.
I promise you.

33:10.039 --> 33:11.374
It's lead.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.756
All goes perfectly, Morgana.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.468
We shall produce the gold we need
in ample time to meet our deadline.

33:22.552 --> 33:26.347
You know what'll happen to these ingots.
You know what's happened before.

33:26.431 --> 33:30.435
But we've improved on the process.
It takes longer each time.

33:30.518 --> 33:32.937
It doesn't matter. It will still happen.

33:33.021 --> 33:36.524
But not until after I have sold the gold
to the Emir...

33:37.191 --> 33:41.487
and become richer than all the Cagliostros
before me dreamed possible.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.823
What is it, my darling?

33:43.906 --> 33:46.993
You seem almost eager
for my project to fail.

33:47.076 --> 33:51.122
The more that gold enters your life,
the more I seem to leave it.

33:51.455 --> 33:53.833
Nonsense, my darling.

34:22.987 --> 34:26.991
Ira's analyzing the pendant
Wonder Woman found in Hutchins' lab.

34:27.158 --> 34:29.702
I have computed my evaluation.

34:29.784 --> 34:32.204
Both Diana and I figure it's lead.

34:32.621 --> 34:35.498
Affirmative. And negative.

34:35.583 --> 34:38.710
What do you mean?
It can't be yes and no. Is it lead or not?

34:38.793 --> 34:43.590
Spectroscopic analysis
reveals an 87.06 lead content...

34:44.550 --> 34:47.678
and 11.73 gold content.

34:48.178 --> 34:51.598
The remainder is composed of
trace metals and oxides.

34:51.681 --> 34:54.768
Hold it. You mean there is gold
in that pendant?

34:54.851 --> 34:59.398
Correction. Lead content now 87.52
and increasing.

34:59.481 --> 35:03.694
According to you, the pendant
is turning to solid lead as we stand here.

35:03.777 --> 35:05.070
Affirmative.

35:05.154 --> 35:09.283
You mean, the pendant used to be gold
and now it's turning to lead?

35:09.366 --> 35:10.534
Affirmative.

35:10.617 --> 35:14.871
My calculations indicate that
at one time the object was solid gold.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.667
Then when Eve gave the pendant
to Dr. Hutchins, it was gold.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.377
It was the same pendant.

35:20.460 --> 35:21.878
Illogical conclusion.

35:21.962 --> 35:25.257
Is it possible that the pendant was lead
at one time?

35:25.340 --> 35:28.635
Affirmative. Not only possible,
but probable.

35:29.386 --> 35:32.556
Alchemy. In this day and age.

35:33.849 --> 35:35.934
Alchemy, the medieval science...

35:36.017 --> 35:39.729
Which tried to change base metals,
such as lead, into gold.

35:39.813 --> 35:41.314
All right, Ira.

35:43.733 --> 35:47.737
The subject is now alchemy.
What name pops into your memory bank?

35:51.157 --> 35:54.035
Count Cagliostro. Name first adopted by...

35:54.327 --> 35:57.789
Guiseppe Balsamo.
Born Palermo, Italy, 1743.

35:57.998 --> 36:01.543
A fake, swindler, alchemist, you name it.

36:02.669 --> 36:05.547
- You an expert?
- Let's just say I've done my homework.

36:05.630 --> 36:09.426
Especially after I talked to
our agent in Zurich.

36:09.509 --> 36:10.760
Why? What did he say?

36:10.844 --> 36:14.222
All the oil producers are transferring funds
to their Swiss banks.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.767
It's supposed to go to a special account
held by Count Cagliostro.

36:17.851 --> 36:19.227
Cagliostro?

36:20.019 --> 36:24.649
A descendant of the original.
Magic and swindling are family traditions.

36:25.316 --> 36:28.194
You think he's the one
turning lead into gold?

36:28.278 --> 36:31.573
Someone sent me that pendant
to get me on his trail.

36:32.323 --> 36:35.368
We better find him
before his billion-dollar con pays off.

36:35.451 --> 36:37.245
You're not kidding.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.914
He's operating in the area. We're sure.

36:39.998 --> 36:42.417
I'm working on a couple of leads
right now.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.003
Good. In the meantime,
I think it's time I introduced myself...

36:46.087 --> 36:48.005
to the Emir of Quiana.

36:48.965 --> 36:51.300
- This is an outrage!
- It's an emergency.

36:51.384 --> 36:54.929
Never before have I been so rudely
torn away from my daily enterprises.

36:55.012 --> 36:59.308
- My men will drop you at the race track.
- By then, five of my horses would've run.

36:59.392 --> 37:00.685
Sit down.

37:09.652 --> 37:11.904
We're going to talk about three things:

37:11.988 --> 37:14.865
gold, the price of oil, and Cagliostro.

37:15.408 --> 37:18.786
The first two I am familiar with,
of course...

37:19.704 --> 37:22.707
but Cagliostro?
That's a name I do not know.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.876
You're not that lucky, Your Highness.

37:27.211 --> 37:31.006
I want you to be careful
about any merchandise you buy from him.

37:31.215 --> 37:33.384
- Merchandise?
- That's right.

37:33.717 --> 37:36.470
Thanks to Diana Prince,
we've put it all together.

37:36.554 --> 37:39.056
You're planning on increasing
the price of oil...

37:39.139 --> 37:42.351
to pay for the gold you're buying
from Cagliostro at a discount.

37:42.434 --> 37:45.062
Why, I don't even know-

37:45.145 --> 37:47.398
A simple reminder, Your Highness...

37:47.481 --> 37:51.068
one you may discuss with Cagliostro
the next time you see him:

37:51.151 --> 37:53.278
You get only what you pay for.

37:58.617 --> 38:01.328
That pompous little moron
doubts my word?

38:01.412 --> 38:05.124
It's Diana Prince. She and the IADC
have put him up to it.

38:05.374 --> 38:08.502
Perhaps it's time for you
to take what you have and leave.

38:08.585 --> 38:12.756
No, it is not enough.
The world has much to pay for.

38:13.131 --> 38:17.052
The Cagliostros have been exposed
to 200 years of scorn and ridicule.

38:17.135 --> 38:20.222
A great deal could happen
in the next few hours.

38:20.305 --> 38:21.431
Yes.

38:22.182 --> 38:26.103
I can destroy Diana Prince once and for all.

38:29.398 --> 38:31.149
Now you see it. Now you don't.

38:31.233 --> 38:34.569
The hand, of course,
has always been quicker than the eye.

38:34.653 --> 38:38.115
- Okay, which one is the pea under?
- This one.

38:39.408 --> 38:41.451
I've never seen that before.

38:49.584 --> 38:53.672
Just got flunked in Psych 2.
Next show at 4:00.

38:56.341 --> 38:58.635
Mr. Farnum, you certainly got here fast.

38:58.718 --> 39:00.971
- Is Miss Prince all right?
- This way, please.

39:01.054 --> 39:03.932
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing at all.

39:09.813 --> 39:12.399
- Open up!
- Welcome, Mr. Farnum.

39:40.969 --> 39:44.263
Count Cagliostro! I always respected you.

39:44.347 --> 39:48.059
And well you should.
I am the greatest magician in the world.

39:48.768 --> 39:53.189
And you, my young friend, will assist me
in the finale of my current engagement.

39:53.272 --> 39:57.652
You will help me to capture Diana Prince
and crush her.

40:23.010 --> 40:26.430
You, I'm afraid,
are helpless victims of circumstance.

40:26.514 --> 40:30.643
If an ex-employee of mine hadn't tried
to alert Diana Prince of my plans...

40:30.726 --> 40:32.686
neither of you would be here.

40:32.770 --> 40:34.605
Your employee sent her the pendant.

40:34.688 --> 40:37.566
He hoped to lead her to the magic shop,
believing that...

40:37.650 --> 40:41.570
ultimately she would expose
the little problem I have with my gold.

40:41.654 --> 40:43.072
"Little problem"?

40:43.155 --> 40:47.409
No one can or ever will be able to change
worthless metals into gold.

40:47.618 --> 40:49.453
Perhaps not, Dr. Hutchins.

40:49.536 --> 40:52.665
But I have come close enough
to have my gold change me...

40:52.748 --> 40:55.167
into the richest man of all time.

40:56.585 --> 40:59.254
Diana Prince is on to you, Cagliostro.

40:59.588 --> 41:02.132
And I knew that magic shop was a setup.

41:02.341 --> 41:04.718
I have a homing device
sewn into my left sock.

41:04.802 --> 41:07.763
The whole IADC is probably outside
right now.

41:08.430 --> 41:10.432
An amusing idea, Mr. Farnum.

41:10.516 --> 41:13.977
But let's not wait for Miss Prince
to come storming over the walls.

41:14.061 --> 41:17.189
I have a much more civilized rendezvous
in mind.

41:17.314 --> 41:19.316
What are you going to do?

41:19.900 --> 41:21.401
Watch closely.

41:38.001 --> 41:39.127
Prince here.

41:39.211 --> 41:42.464
I have a call for you from Harold Farnum.
He says it's urgent.

41:42.547 --> 41:44.007
Okay, patch him through.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.135
- Diana, is that you?
- Harold?

41:47.219 --> 41:50.889
I'm glad I got you.
Listen, I think I got a lead for you.

41:50.972 --> 41:54.267
But you got to come quick.
Meet me down on Orchid.

41:54.392 --> 41:57.062
You know where that
old, deserted House of Horrors is?

41:57.145 --> 42:00.065
- Yeah.
- Great. See you there in half an hour.

42:04.653 --> 42:07.280
I think I will send a friend instead.

42:11.576 --> 42:13.995
You're a real louse, Cagliostro.

42:14.162 --> 42:15.997
I thought I was rather good.

42:16.081 --> 42:20.085
Impersonation has always been
one of my minor talents.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.880
I'm telling you,
if you do anything to hurt Miss Prince-

42:23.963 --> 42:27.300
- Take them downstairs.
- What are you going to do with us?

42:27.383 --> 42:30.178
Out of courtesy,
I shall wait for Miss Prince.

42:30.261 --> 42:33.848
And then I shall drown the three of you
like rats.

42:40.730 --> 42:42.440
You're going to destroy them?

42:42.523 --> 42:45.401
- That's of no concern to you.
- Like you did Nimler?

42:45.485 --> 42:48.488
- Nimler was a traitor.
- But these are innocent people.

42:48.571 --> 42:50.323
They are in my way.

42:51.532 --> 42:55.203
Now I have a reception to arrange,
if you don't mind.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.874
Of course, Count Cagliostro.

43:18.142 --> 43:20.561
I got it. I know how we can get out.

43:20.645 --> 43:23.439
See if your homing device
will transmit Morse code.

43:23.522 --> 43:26.609
No. Everything I need is here except...

43:28.611 --> 43:30.738
I got to have another. You got a pencil?

43:30.821 --> 43:33.824
You gonna write a letter of protest
to the Magicians' Guild?

43:33.908 --> 43:37.495
No. I'm going to make a carbon arc torch
and cut through that door.

43:37.578 --> 43:39.205
I can see the headline now:

43:39.288 --> 43:42.833
"Nobel Prize-winning metallurgist
drowns with Houdini, Jr. "

44:07.649 --> 44:10.361
- Wonder Woman!
- Morgana, spare me any more tricks.

44:10.444 --> 44:13.030
Just tell me
where Hutchins and the boy are.

44:13.113 --> 44:16.033
They're in a cell in the basement,
and you'd better hurry.

44:16.116 --> 44:19.119
- I told you, no more tricks.
- It's the truth.

44:19.203 --> 44:22.122
Cagliostro plans on killing both of them,
and Diana Prince.

44:22.206 --> 44:25.626
- In fact, I was on my way to warn her.
- Is Cagliostro in there, too?

44:25.709 --> 44:29.630
Yes, he is. With his gold.
The Emir is going to pick up the shipment.

44:29.713 --> 44:33.175
- Not if I can help it.
- Wonder Woman, you'd better be careful.

44:33.258 --> 44:37.012
Cagliostro's a magician, the best.
He even had me fooled.

44:38.221 --> 44:39.931
Thank you, Morgana.

44:40.015 --> 44:42.642
Do I still need to warn Diana Prince?

44:42.726 --> 44:44.728
- Maybe you'd better.
- Okay.

45:01.369 --> 45:03.246
See? I told you it would work.

45:03.330 --> 45:06.333
Great. In five short years,
we'll be free men.

45:11.463 --> 45:15.133
- Wonder Woman!
- There's a door just outside to your right.

45:15.216 --> 45:17.552
Get to a phone,
call Steve Trevor at the IADC.

45:17.636 --> 45:20.305
Tell him to meet me here
with the police. Hurry.

45:56.215 --> 45:59.510
This last pallet completes the shipment,
as agreed.

45:59.844 --> 46:01.137
Yes.

46:02.180 --> 46:05.850
Within 10 minutes, my bank
will make full payment to your account.

46:05.933 --> 46:07.101
Very good.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.240
So, Wonder Woman...

46:21.324 --> 46:24.744
you return to thwart the Cagliostros,
as you have for centuries.

46:24.827 --> 46:27.038
But this time, you shall lose.

46:27.121 --> 46:30.541
You have it backwards, Cagliostro.
I've already won.

46:30.708 --> 46:32.209
What's happening?

46:32.293 --> 46:35.129
You were about to make a big mistake,
Your Highness.

46:35.588 --> 46:40.009
That gold you think you're buying
will turn to lead within two days.

46:40.092 --> 46:41.135
Lead?

46:41.218 --> 46:43.679
- So, now, Cagliostro-
- No, Wonder Woman!

46:43.763 --> 46:46.307
I am not my father,
nor any of my ancestors.

46:46.390 --> 46:49.393
This is one Cagliostro
who shall escape you.

46:49.477 --> 46:50.728
Stop her!

47:00.779 --> 47:02.948
Police! You're under arrest.

47:09.913 --> 47:11.915
- Steve, Cagliostro's gone.
- Gone?

47:11.999 --> 47:13.542
The gold is in the Emir's truck.

47:13.625 --> 47:16.462
You were going through with the deal
despite our warning.

47:16.545 --> 47:17.713
That swindler!

47:17.796 --> 47:20.799
True, but you were willing to destroy
the world's economy...

47:20.883 --> 47:22.509
for personal gain.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.555
My bank.

47:26.638 --> 47:30.392
In less than 10 minutes, it will
make payment to Cagliostro's account.

47:30.475 --> 47:32.227
I've got to stop it!

47:33.061 --> 47:35.480
Thanks, Wonder Woman.
Get these two out of here.

47:35.564 --> 47:36.773
Wonder Woman...

47:36.857 --> 47:40.402
this is for getting me and Dr. Hutchins
out of that cell.

47:41.945 --> 47:45.115
I did it!
Why couldn't Diana have been here?

47:45.198 --> 47:49.286
I'll make sure she hears.
You actually did a trick and it worked.
