00:14.721 --> 00:18.251
<i>Mulder. Mulder.</i>

00:19.992 --> 00:21.997
<i>Mulder.</i>

00:22.128 --> 00:26.005
<i>Mulder. Mulder.</i>

00:26.131 --> 00:28.335
<i>Is this Mulder?</i>

00:39.455 --> 00:42.982
<i>Mulder. Mulder.</i>

00:45.152 --> 00:47.421
<i>Is this Mulder?</i>

00:47.615 --> 00:51.459
<i>Mulder. Fox Mulder.</i>

00:53.112 --> 00:55.597
<i>Mulder. Fox Mulder.</i>

00:55.651 --> 00:56.962
- Mulder.
- Hmm.

01:04.670 --> 01:05.938
Hmm.

01:05.971 --> 01:07.974
<i>- Is this Mulder?</i>
- Hmm?

01:09.509 --> 01:10.811
<i>Fox Mulder.</i>

01:10.843 --> 01:12.044
Langly?

01:12.352 --> 01:14.610
<i>Uh, I-I believe...</i>

01:14.699 --> 01:16.368
<i>I believe you knew me as Langly.</i>

01:16.414 --> 01:18.985
<i>Um, Richard Langly. "Ringo" Langly.</i>

01:19.018 --> 01:20.620
Lone Gunman Langly?

01:44.029 --> 01:46.097
<i>Mulder, I-I need to know.</i>

01:47.045 --> 01:48.815
<i>Am I dead?</i>

01:50.125 --> 01:52.042
<i>If I am...</i>

01:52.252 --> 01:53.820
<i>they know that I know.</i>

01:53.853 --> 01:55.722
Know that he knows what?

02:07.866 --> 02:09.401
Go.

02:45.871 --> 02:48.641
Scully? You all right?

02:48.675 --> 02:51.665
There's one in the room.
Behind the couch.

02:59.018 --> 03:00.887
Two down, all clear.

03:17.171 --> 03:19.148
<i>Mulder.</i>

03:19.504 --> 03:20.840
<i>Mulder...</i>

04:02.817 --> 04:04.619
Better call it in from a landline.

04:04.668 --> 04:05.762
Yeah.

04:12.442 --> 04:14.210
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

04:14.244 --> 04:17.113
XF072161.

04:17.846 --> 04:19.884
Yes, Washington, D.C. field office.

04:21.951 --> 04:23.420
Yes, I'm calling in an incident

04:23.454 --> 04:25.689
where multiple gunshots were exchanged.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.758
There are two suspects on the ground.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.854
No, we weren't injured.

04:30.761 --> 04:32.229
Agent Mulder's residence.

04:32.261 --> 04:35.959
Yes. Yeah. Farrs Corner.

04:36.561 --> 04:40.036
227700 Wallis Road.

04:49.146 --> 04:50.357
You're careful not to taint that,

04:50.381 --> 04:52.183
but you're willing to conceal this?

04:52.216 --> 04:54.151
You said "taint."

04:54.184 --> 04:56.386
This may not be related to that.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.289
Yes, but we're not gonna know

04:58.322 --> 05:00.010
unless it's properly investigated.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.558
Scully, ten minutes ago,

05:01.591 --> 05:02.993
we received a message on this phone

05:03.026 --> 05:04.829
from a man who's been dead for 16 years,

05:04.862 --> 05:06.779
and now you want me
to hand it over to evidence,

05:06.818 --> 05:09.615
where it's gonna sit in a locker
for what, two, three years?

05:11.535 --> 05:13.270
I was gone back then.

05:13.302 --> 05:15.038
Could-could Langly be alive?

05:15.504 --> 05:17.669
No. I was at Langly's,

05:17.747 --> 05:21.745
at the Lone Gunmen's burial
in Arlington Cemetery.

05:21.778 --> 05:23.781
But did you ever see Langly's body?

05:24.485 --> 05:26.120
Well, nobody did.

05:26.145 --> 05:27.318
They were exposed

05:27.350 --> 05:30.546
to a weaponized strain
of the Marburg virus.

05:31.021 --> 05:32.323
Their bodies were incinerated.

05:32.355 --> 05:33.533
It's got to be connected, right?

05:33.557 --> 05:36.826
That-that whatever...
Langly message and this.

05:37.072 --> 05:40.163
They know that he knows. W-Who's they?

05:40.197 --> 05:42.879
I mean, it's-it's-it's too much
of a coincidence. Right?

05:42.904 --> 05:44.669
Well, I think that the Langly message

05:44.701 --> 05:46.670
was warning us
that these guys were coming.

05:46.704 --> 05:48.105
It wasn't warning us.

05:48.137 --> 05:50.473
It-it asked if he were dead.

05:50.871 --> 05:53.144
What do you think it was?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.513
I don't know what I think. I don't know.

05:55.957 --> 05:58.281
But I'll tell you what I do know.

05:59.550 --> 06:02.346
We got to take a trip to IKEA.

06:02.439 --> 06:04.508
Well, that was fast.

06:10.259 --> 06:11.995
What is that?

06:12.028 --> 06:14.598
A Critical Incident
Response Group maneuver?

06:17.434 --> 06:20.004
- I got 14 rounds.
- Eight.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.509
Don't answer the phone.

06:26.543 --> 06:28.454
If we use the phone,
they may be able to pinpoint

06:28.478 --> 06:30.014
our exact location in the house.

06:32.615 --> 06:34.185
Identify yourself!

06:35.298 --> 06:38.664
Can't hear you. Answer your phone.

06:38.712 --> 06:41.279
Should I call Skinner?
We haven't talked to him

06:41.304 --> 06:43.690
in a couple weeks.
I don't know where he stands.

06:44.105 --> 06:45.641
We are federal agents.

06:45.684 --> 06:47.740
We are armed. Identify yourselves.

06:47.787 --> 06:49.044
Hold on, hold on.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.968
See, the "we are armed" thing...

06:51.000 --> 06:53.293
That is a problem for you.

06:53.378 --> 06:55.004
Put down your guns.

06:55.058 --> 06:56.807
- Come out.
<i>- Hello?</i>

06:56.839 --> 06:59.441
Skinner, it's Scully. I'm with Mulder.

06:59.496 --> 07:01.153
<i>- Listen to me, Scully.</i>
- You don't have much time.

07:01.177 --> 07:04.048
<i>Surrender. I can't
explain on an open line,</i>

07:04.081 --> 07:05.883
<i>- but I can't help you right now.</i>
- Waiting!

07:05.915 --> 07:07.927
<i>The only chance you have
is to put down your weapons</i>

07:07.951 --> 07:09.186
<i>and surrender to them.</i>

07:11.345 --> 07:12.689
You know what you did.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.324
We defended ourselves!

07:14.358 --> 07:16.660
Yeah, yeah, that's what they all say.

07:16.866 --> 07:20.230
But, see, they were wearing
body cams, so...

07:20.264 --> 07:22.466
You know how that turns out
for the ones who weren't.

07:22.499 --> 07:23.901
Skinner says surrender.

07:25.108 --> 07:27.244
Why should we surrender?

07:27.271 --> 07:30.749
- To who? Why are we under suspicion?
- I don't know.

07:31.809 --> 07:33.377
Identify yourselves

07:33.410 --> 07:36.713
or we'll be forced to consider
you hostile agents and respond

07:36.754 --> 07:39.540
with deadly action
to any aggressive action.

07:39.682 --> 07:41.751
Identify ourselves?

07:41.918 --> 07:45.722
No. We don't need to identify ourselves.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.959
What world are you living in?

08:27.153 --> 08:28.676
_

08:28.715 --> 08:30.183
__

08:31.051 --> 08:32.980
_

08:33.652 --> 08:35.183
_

08:35.642 --> 08:36.852
_

08:37.914 --> 08:39.658
_

08:41.010 --> 08:43.546
Where's your phone, bro?

08:44.056 --> 08:46.725
Easy for Orwell to say.

08:49.824 --> 08:51.893
"I want to believe"?

08:52.070 --> 08:54.381
Here's what I believe.

08:54.457 --> 08:56.834
We would've all saved
lots of money and headaches

08:56.912 --> 08:59.889
if we only knew Americans
would have been just fine

08:59.929 --> 09:01.564
losing the Cold War...

09:01.716 --> 09:04.851
if they could only make
a little money off of it.

09:06.470 --> 09:10.508
You guys there, find his phone.
You two, watch these two.

09:10.636 --> 09:12.238
Once we find his phone...

09:25.608 --> 09:28.322
<i>Mulder. Mulder.</i>

09:29.525 --> 09:32.353
- Hold on, hold on. Hold on!
- Shh, shh.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.835
<i>Mulder. Mulder?</i>

09:39.182 --> 09:40.871
<i>Mulder.</i>

09:43.940 --> 09:45.979
<i>Mulder.</i>

09:46.650 --> 09:48.368
<i>This is Richard Langly.</i>

09:48.440 --> 09:49.680
<i>Richard Langly.</i>

09:49.712 --> 09:51.748
<i>Ringo Langly. I need to know.</i>

09:51.901 --> 09:54.761
- Well, well, well, Ringo.<i>
- Am I dead?</i>

09:54.808 --> 09:56.619
You're never going to know.

09:56.707 --> 09:58.972
And neither will these two.

10:49.078 --> 10:50.717
"Surrender"?

10:50.827 --> 10:52.328
"Give up"?

10:58.101 --> 11:00.493
I'm risking my own ass being out here.

11:00.532 --> 11:02.813
Who are they? Why are you so afraid?

11:02.868 --> 11:05.266
They're not U.S. intelligence,
I'll tell you that much.

11:05.319 --> 11:06.687
Commander was Russian.

11:08.272 --> 11:10.008
Skinner, tell us who they are.

11:10.256 --> 11:12.044
It's Purlieu Services,

11:12.795 --> 11:15.846
an American security contractor
with its headquarters in Moscow.

11:16.021 --> 11:18.922
A private contractor has
ascendancy over the FBI?

11:19.141 --> 11:21.375
Under a classified security directive...

11:21.552 --> 11:23.455
from the Executive Branch.

11:26.056 --> 11:27.535
I thought they were just
questioning you guys.

11:27.559 --> 11:29.027
Why would they want to kill you?

11:29.099 --> 11:31.630
- You tell us.
- They're not supposed

11:31.669 --> 11:34.341
to kill any intelligence agents,
but apparently, they will.

11:34.482 --> 11:36.000
You need to come with me.

11:46.224 --> 11:48.228
You have any money?

11:51.583 --> 11:52.818
Take it.

11:53.037 --> 11:54.919
It's all I have on me.

12:02.512 --> 12:04.505
Is Langly alive?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.693
Lone Gunmen Langly?

12:06.919 --> 12:08.825
You and I buried him in Arlington

12:08.864 --> 12:10.635
along with Byers and Frohike.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.403
You didn't answer my question.

12:14.171 --> 12:15.769
I just did.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.956
He's buried in Arlington.

12:30.261 --> 12:32.257
Hack Mulder's phone.

12:32.423 --> 12:34.292
Find out how he contacted Mulder.

12:42.852 --> 12:44.257
Kill switch.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.710
_

13:01.392 --> 13:03.411
Here's Byers.

13:05.322 --> 13:07.232
Frohike.

13:07.392 --> 13:09.084
What are we looking for, Mulder?

13:09.194 --> 13:11.685
Knowing Langly, bread crumbs.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.338
Huh. His birth date is wrong.

13:20.847 --> 13:23.730
October 13. We shared the same birthday.

13:24.339 --> 13:26.766
Hmm.

13:27.244 --> 13:30.681
Byers was born on the day
Kennedy was assassinated, so,

13:30.715 --> 13:32.149
that's correct.

13:32.182 --> 13:33.684
Frohike.

13:33.789 --> 13:35.654
1945.

13:35.686 --> 13:38.590
Frohike look 57 to you when he died?

13:38.623 --> 13:41.026
Frohike looked 57 the day he was born.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.592
His birthday is the same day
that FDR died.

13:44.709 --> 13:49.293
So, Langly... March 28, 1969.
Any president die that day?

13:49.576 --> 13:52.816
- Eisenhower.
- Who needs Google when you got Scully?

13:52.855 --> 13:54.403
Right?

13:54.605 --> 13:59.270
Well, JFK was the 35th president,

13:59.348 --> 14:01.946
Eisenhower was
the 34th president, FDR...

14:01.979 --> 14:03.356
Now you're just showing off, really.

14:03.380 --> 14:06.062
- The...
- Thirty...

14:06.093 --> 14:07.897
- 32nd president.
- ...two. 32.

14:07.937 --> 14:09.554
34, 35.

14:09.586 --> 14:11.822
32nd, 34th, 35th. Anything in that?

14:11.855 --> 14:14.758
You mean, other than the fact
that the 33rd is missing?

14:14.792 --> 14:16.360
33rd? Three and three?

14:16.796 --> 14:19.398
Three up, three down, three over?

14:19.423 --> 14:21.232
Well, he's facing this way.

14:21.465 --> 14:24.240
One... two...

14:24.668 --> 14:25.936
three. I'll go this way.

14:25.970 --> 14:27.571
All right.

14:38.036 --> 14:39.718
Scully.

14:46.758 --> 14:48.639
This is it.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.264
I watched his funeral

14:51.639 --> 14:53.431
from 1,000 yards away,

14:53.550 --> 14:55.416
over there, through binoculars.

14:55.532 --> 14:57.619
Deep Throat.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.839
I didn't know his real name
till right now.

15:02.847 --> 15:05.417
I never visited,
out of respect, I guess. I...

15:07.051 --> 15:08.670
1994.

15:10.173 --> 15:14.145
He's dead because the world was
so dangerous and complex then.

15:14.285 --> 15:16.430
Who'd have thought we'd look
back with nostalgia and say,

15:16.454 --> 15:18.623
"That was a simpler time," Scully?

15:19.229 --> 15:21.593
Everything we feared came to pass.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.460
How the hell did that happen?

15:23.494 --> 15:26.163
Mulder, Deep Throat was assassinated

15:26.196 --> 15:27.932
eight years before the Lone Gunmen died.

15:28.165 --> 15:31.671
How and why would Langly
leave bread crumbs

15:31.696 --> 15:33.642
at a grave in a graveyard

15:33.692 --> 15:35.692
that he didn't even know
he was gonna be buried in?

15:43.874 --> 15:46.367
This cross...

15:46.773 --> 15:48.119
is different from all the others.

15:48.152 --> 15:51.022
It's not engraved. It protrudes.

15:54.482 --> 15:56.628
What is that?

16:02.532 --> 16:04.018
Wait.

16:04.301 --> 16:05.903
Thank you, Skinner.

16:13.492 --> 16:16.062
I think it's a memory medallion.

16:16.125 --> 16:19.914
You scan it, and it links
to a video of the pet or person.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.753
But I don't have my phone to scan it.

16:24.656 --> 16:28.259
Mulder, do gravediggers work at night?

17:31.340 --> 17:33.348
_

17:35.620 --> 17:37.001
I'm gonna open an X-File

17:37.027 --> 17:38.729
- on this bran muffin.
- Oh.

17:38.763 --> 17:41.066
I got to get to the bottom
of why it's so freaking good.

17:41.099 --> 17:42.949
I don't care if it came out
of an alien's butt.

17:42.989 --> 17:44.134
I'm gonna eat the whole thing.

17:44.158 --> 17:45.360
Mmm.

17:47.637 --> 17:49.719
All right.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.475
New Yorkers call it
"The Long Lines Building."

17:52.500 --> 17:53.820
Edward Snowden documents indicated

17:53.844 --> 17:55.355
the building...
code named "Titanpointe"...

17:55.379 --> 17:57.916
was used as an NSA
mass surveillance station

17:57.948 --> 17:59.922
in a program code named "Blarney."

17:59.985 --> 18:03.187
It was started in the '70s
and expanded after 9/11.

18:03.399 --> 18:06.876
Well, why? Why did he point us
to an NSA program?

18:06.922 --> 18:09.194
Why didn't he just tell us
if it was about a building?

18:09.219 --> 18:10.382
I-I opened an X-File

18:10.412 --> 18:12.075
on this building in the, in the '90s.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.264
In fact,

18:13.296 --> 18:15.232
Langly actually provided
the initial information.

18:15.257 --> 18:16.266
We should check it out.

18:16.335 --> 18:19.210
<i>It?</i> An X-File?

18:19.257 --> 18:20.472
Mm-hmm.

18:20.504 --> 18:22.974
You mean the X-Files
that are in our office

18:23.006 --> 18:25.976
that we can't get into kind of X-File?

18:26.010 --> 18:28.246
Right. Okay.

18:38.014 --> 18:39.949
Don't get in.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.284
I need you to
put the weapon down, Mulder.

18:48.323 --> 18:49.659
Cannot do that, sir.

18:49.691 --> 18:51.891
You seem to be working with
people who tried to kill us.

18:52.187 --> 18:53.997
I <i> don't</i> work with them.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.303
The world is different, Mulder.

19:03.623 --> 19:06.709
When Scully started, it was just us.

19:06.787 --> 19:11.014
Dark forces in the U.S. government.
There was barely a Russia.

19:11.053 --> 19:13.948
Now there's 17
U.S. intelligence agencies.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.002
Homeland Security, Russian FSB,

19:16.052 --> 19:18.479
Chinese MSS, ISIS,

19:18.518 --> 19:21.143
al-Qaeda, Blackwater.

19:21.356 --> 19:24.093
Private companies launch
to the Space Station,

19:24.119 --> 19:26.655
and all of them are in bed
with one another,

19:26.696 --> 19:28.799
while trying to exterminate each other,

19:28.999 --> 19:31.502
and that includes each of us.

19:36.685 --> 19:38.909
We need your help, Walter.

19:41.744 --> 19:44.014
Even if we don't trust you.

20:00.611 --> 20:02.065
What is this?

20:04.534 --> 20:05.901
How did we get here?

20:06.195 --> 20:07.836
What about us?

20:08.071 --> 20:10.173
We were the ones
who were just assaulted.

20:10.206 --> 20:11.641
We can't go to our home.

20:11.695 --> 20:14.133
They'll be waiting for us at our office.

20:14.377 --> 20:17.584
We're not asking
for you to get us out of this,

20:18.279 --> 20:20.134
but we do expect your help.

20:20.225 --> 20:22.085
We need to see the X-Files.

20:25.779 --> 20:27.470
If you want to see the X-Files,

20:27.501 --> 20:29.282
you don't have to go to the office.

20:29.558 --> 20:32.895
After the X-Files were closed
in 2002, the agency lobbied

20:32.921 --> 20:36.439
Director Mueller for
jurisdiction over the files.

20:36.517 --> 20:37.725
They were looking to cross-reference

20:37.749 --> 20:40.804
their own past research
in telekinesis, MK-Ultra,

20:41.171 --> 20:43.472
remote viewing with your fieldwork.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.375
The agency then contracted
a private company

20:46.409 --> 20:48.745
to digitize
and maintain the files online

20:48.784 --> 20:51.388
for any U.S.
intelligence agencies to have

20:51.413 --> 20:53.309
classified access.

20:53.615 --> 20:55.218
A private contractor.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.568
Purlieu?

20:58.086 --> 21:00.428
So the Russians who tried to kill us

21:00.622 --> 21:03.459
have had access to all of our work?

21:03.959 --> 21:06.462
So when the X-Files were
reopened, why weren't we told?

21:06.810 --> 21:08.564
Why didn't <i> you</i> tell us?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.767
The X-Files belong to us.

21:10.872 --> 21:12.794
Do you work with them?

21:12.936 --> 21:14.903
Do you work <i> for</i> them?

21:15.802 --> 21:17.940
You two were gone.

21:18.107 --> 21:19.918
I was left here. I didn't know
if you were coming back,

21:19.942 --> 21:21.119
and the files were too important

21:21.143 --> 21:22.509
to sit in a basement gathering dust.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.386
And what's in them...
belongs to everyone.

21:25.454 --> 21:26.706
That's the point of 'em.

21:29.434 --> 21:31.428
Control of the X-Files
reverted back to the FBI

21:31.453 --> 21:33.442
after the files were reopened.

21:48.823 --> 21:51.699
Yeah? All right.

21:54.395 --> 21:56.324
_

21:56.395 --> 21:57.721
All the files

21:57.746 --> 22:01.902
on NSA Project Blarney and the
Titanpointe building are gone.

22:12.837 --> 22:15.373
Langly has been bleached
from the X-Files.

22:15.537 --> 22:17.367
Not just the person,

22:17.400 --> 22:18.968
but any information Langly contributed

22:19.002 --> 22:22.506
to theoretical computer science.

22:34.878 --> 22:37.554
Byers and Frohike are still in here.

22:39.255 --> 22:41.323
Cryptographic protocols,

22:41.356 --> 22:43.423
machine learning, quantum algorithms,

22:43.501 --> 22:45.337
all gone.

22:45.428 --> 22:46.892
All right, thanks.

22:47.330 --> 22:50.625
I had the director speak with
the Executive Branch

22:51.109 --> 22:53.789
to call this off, but the, uh,

22:54.102 --> 22:55.604
the Bureau's not in good standing

22:55.638 --> 22:57.874
with the White House these days.

22:57.907 --> 22:59.074
How do you like that?

22:59.108 --> 23:01.378
The FBI finally found out what it's like

23:01.410 --> 23:03.679
to be looked upon as a little spooky.

23:03.712 --> 23:06.016
Okay, so complete the two problems,

23:06.048 --> 23:09.418
and e-mail me your solutions by Friday.

23:30.893 --> 23:33.124
We're old friends of Richard Langly.

23:33.536 --> 23:35.382
I figured if I...

23:35.913 --> 23:38.614
hadn't seen you in five years,

23:38.678 --> 23:40.670
then I never would and I could...

23:40.917 --> 23:42.483
stop regretting.

23:42.553 --> 23:45.422
We received a message on my cell.

23:45.498 --> 23:46.923
Asking if he was alive.

23:49.193 --> 23:52.100
You should go. They're watching.

23:52.227 --> 23:53.830
Who is watching?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.841
Purlieu Services.

24:02.337 --> 24:04.817
They came to us 15 years ago,

24:05.274 --> 24:07.710
with the science and the math to prove

24:07.744 --> 24:09.544
that we could live forever.

24:09.778 --> 24:12.548
The contract states we can
live out our natural lives.

24:12.582 --> 24:15.168
We could continue our work after we die.

24:15.351 --> 24:17.621
And where is Richard now?

24:19.522 --> 24:22.891
They brought us to a facility,
and over a two-week period,

24:22.925 --> 24:25.095
they scanned and copied
the salient features

24:25.128 --> 24:26.929
of our biological brain.

24:27.119 --> 24:30.933
They uploaded us into a simulation.

24:30.974 --> 24:34.010
The two minds could never exist at once.

24:34.035 --> 24:37.824
Our simulated selves would come
into consciousness

24:37.887 --> 24:40.944
in that life once we died in this.

24:41.473 --> 24:44.346
And so did he instruct you to...

24:44.380 --> 24:45.932
to leave this for us?

24:46.181 --> 24:47.950
He entrusted me in case

24:47.984 --> 24:50.919
he discovered that they had lied
about life in the simulation.

24:50.952 --> 24:54.123
And if Richard is reaching out,
then they must have.

25:00.496 --> 25:02.806
We wanted a life eternal together.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.538
So we took the deal.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.546
But we theorized what to do

25:16.694 --> 25:18.314
if it was not what they had offered.

25:18.346 --> 25:21.884
How would that life know
it was a simulation?

25:21.918 --> 25:23.620
There would be cheats.

25:23.645 --> 25:27.404
The stars and the moon,
they wouldn't be fully realized.

25:27.450 --> 25:29.558
The background people
wouldn't be fully rendered.

25:29.592 --> 25:32.262
They'd constrict the use of technology,

25:32.294 --> 25:35.147
of two-way contact to control them.

25:35.726 --> 25:39.830
But Richard being Richard,
hacked a way to reach out.

25:39.901 --> 25:42.405
Why reach out to me if you're alive?

25:45.916 --> 25:49.220
Memory isn't erased, it's suppressed.

25:49.411 --> 25:52.976
They've probably theorized, as we have,

25:53.022 --> 25:54.516
that their lives are a simulation,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.987
but perhaps Richard's subconscious

25:58.019 --> 26:00.386
must have recalled
the two of you investigating

26:00.425 --> 26:02.058
this type of subject matter.

26:02.091 --> 26:03.827
Maybe he saw Mulder in his dreams.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.362
Who hasn't?

26:10.032 --> 26:11.835
Purlieu is likely aware that Richard

26:11.868 --> 26:15.237
is reaching out to you
to expose a simulation.

26:15.271 --> 26:17.774
Is there anything we can do
to help Langly get through?

26:17.806 --> 26:19.476
Do you have the cell?

26:21.878 --> 26:23.146
No, it was taken from us.

26:25.046 --> 26:27.950
I phreaked my phone years ago,

26:28.122 --> 26:32.294
using video signal manipulation
to my cell.

26:32.828 --> 26:34.463
You'd have to help him

26:34.590 --> 26:36.864
by making this side easier to reach.

26:36.934 --> 26:39.604
You're gonna have to edit
the SIM card to your number,

26:39.629 --> 26:41.374
and follow these steps...

26:41.765 --> 26:44.099
for the phone,
so that you can contact...

27:05.029 --> 27:06.823
Mulder, that's evidence.

27:07.019 --> 27:09.029
He's evidence.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.878
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.777
- Come on.
- It's been a, it's been a long day.

27:27.825 --> 27:29.727
Tough day. Thank you.

27:29.759 --> 27:32.028
Chick's freaking out over here.

27:32.070 --> 27:35.640
Scully, you looked so adorbs just there.

27:35.665 --> 27:38.668
All curled up in a ball
in the booth of a skanky bar

27:38.701 --> 27:40.570
with your fingers
wrapped around the grip

27:40.604 --> 27:41.937
of an assassin's Glock.

27:42.038 --> 27:45.601
♪ <i>Going out west where I belong...</i> ♪

27:46.376 --> 27:48.912
I did what I could to follow
Dr. Hamby's algorithms,

27:48.946 --> 27:51.516
and I added what little I know
about phreaking.

27:51.548 --> 27:54.117
And we have to wait and see if
we receive another transmission,

27:54.151 --> 27:56.554
but they knew Langly
was trying to reach us,

27:56.586 --> 27:58.556
and they knew that Dr. Hamby
knew about Langly

27:58.588 --> 28:00.089
and the computer simulations.

28:00.090 --> 28:01.368
The longer we leave the phone on,

28:01.392 --> 28:02.616
the sooner they're gonna find us.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.990
So I got to turn it off, and we
got to move to different spots.

It is Mulder. Is that Langly?

28:21.121 --> 28:22.323
Uh, it's Mulder and Scully.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.340
<i>You are real and I'm not?</i>

28:41.596 --> 28:44.924
Dr. Hamby told us
you were in a simulation.

28:49.383 --> 28:52.119

<i>It's a work camp. We're digital slaves.</i>

29:33.504 --> 29:36.477
They take our uploaded minds
to develop science

29:36.524 --> 29:39.797
that only the elite will use
to leave your world.

29:40.601 --> 29:43.002
We turn theories of space colonization

29:43.042 --> 29:45.026
into realities for them.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.479
We dream, but we're not allowed
to have dreams,

29:47.846 --> 29:50.577
goals, nothing for ourselves.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.880
No choice, no diversity.

29:54.914 --> 29:57.507
There's a... there's a wall
around this place.

29:57.532 --> 29:59.423
The stars are fake.

29:59.637 --> 30:03.975
The sunlight... has no warmth.

30:07.256 --> 30:09.596
<i>And all the great minds that have died</i>

Michael Crichton.

30:16.769 --> 30:18.700
They all hate it here.

30:18.872 --> 30:21.241
They don't even know who they are.

30:21.275 --> 30:23.777
What we were in that life
is completely opposite

30:23.809 --> 30:25.945
from what we are here.

30:27.231 --> 30:30.050
<i>Go to the Long Lines Building.

<i>were included in the Snowden leaks.</i>

30:43.555 --> 30:46.145
NSA and FBI personnel could not carry

30:46.184 --> 30:48.707
identification to or in the building.

30:48.835 --> 30:50.970
You'd have to arrange
for a meeting a week prior,

30:51.004 --> 30:53.796
and confirm with the program
director 24 hours before.

30:53.859 --> 30:56.310
That's what we're sure of.
What we're not sure of is...

30:56.343 --> 30:58.012
Whether they serve mimosas on the bus?

30:58.045 --> 31:00.314
- Ah.
- High-five, Scully.

31:00.402 --> 31:04.003
- That was, uh, that was fun.
- Uh. Are you kidding me?

31:04.084 --> 31:05.932
Langly believed there was
a tunnel between Titanpointe

31:05.956 --> 31:08.292
and the FBI field office
a few blocks away.

31:08.339 --> 31:09.925
You think we can get in there
looking like this

31:09.949 --> 31:11.816
without raising suspicion?

31:11.892 --> 31:13.527
You look good.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.028
_

31:24.637 --> 31:26.839
I'm a bit tied up here
to, uh, flash you my ID,

31:26.873 --> 31:29.109
but Special Agent Scully,

31:29.308 --> 31:32.211
XF071261,

31:32.370 --> 31:34.081
Washington Field Office.

31:34.229 --> 31:36.182
You taking him upstairs to holding?

31:36.216 --> 31:37.685
No, I'm taking him to Titanpointe.

31:39.419 --> 31:43.577
The, uh, NSA guys want to question him.

31:43.851 --> 31:46.661
It would help if you could
get us in the tunnel.

31:48.095 --> 31:51.699
Well, after you drop him off,

31:51.731 --> 31:54.190
maybe you'll come back
and repay the favor.

32:13.147 --> 32:15.780
It's easier getting him through
without cuffs.

32:15.956 --> 32:17.891
I'm not uncuffing him.

32:18.085 --> 32:21.295
This guy's like
Hannibal Lecter-level psycho.

32:43.983 --> 32:46.864
So, hon...

32:47.872 --> 32:49.656
what's your home office?

32:49.794 --> 32:53.460
Sorry, bro. Married to the Bureau.

32:56.482 --> 32:59.232
_

32:59.277 --> 33:00.920
All right.

33:03.002 --> 33:05.116
You know, if they're waiting
outside the elevator doors

33:05.140 --> 33:07.507
when they open, that's it, so...

33:07.546 --> 33:09.507
I'm guessing the computer
simulation is housed

33:09.538 --> 33:12.734
on one of the upper floors
by the exhaust opening, so...

33:13.210 --> 33:14.781
But there are 29 floors.

33:14.815 --> 33:16.758
Mm-hmm.

33:17.142 --> 33:22.047
26, 28. What's after 28? 30. 32.

33:22.154 --> 33:24.157
34, 36, 38.

33:24.191 --> 33:26.794
- There they are!
- Hold it there!

33:37.604 --> 33:39.439
Down the stairs!

33:51.218 --> 33:52.652
What are you running for?

33:53.009 --> 33:56.256
Ain't you heard, FBI Mulder?

33:56.415 --> 33:57.991
You're on <i> our</i> side now.

34:00.733 --> 34:03.483
_

34:19.789 --> 34:21.812
I'll confess.

34:22.623 --> 34:26.409
After our last... encounter,

34:26.976 --> 34:29.143
I was disappointed by you.

34:30.438 --> 34:34.547
I didn't get your value to Mr. Y,

34:34.672 --> 34:36.632
but he explained that, uh,

34:36.732 --> 34:39.201
we'd meet over and over, and then I'd...

34:39.320 --> 34:41.500
change my opinion.

34:43.103 --> 34:45.906
In the last few days, I've seen your...

34:45.978 --> 34:48.472
instinct for survival.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.822
Well, now that I've won you over,

34:50.860 --> 34:53.033
you'll stop sending assassins
to kill us?

34:53.431 --> 34:54.966
We've really turned a corner.

34:55.177 --> 34:59.083
Easy. You have a way to go, Fox.

34:59.329 --> 35:03.234
Or rather, you need to change
how you look at all this.

35:05.323 --> 35:08.526
You're still refusing to answer
the question of your father.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.887
You don't understand
what's about to happen.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.665
_

35:21.784 --> 35:24.177
<i>Our world is a progression</i>

35:24.206 --> 35:28.068
<i>of one life being replaced
by another, over and over.</i>

35:28.154 --> 35:30.979
<i>This is what's really meant
by evolution.</i>

35:31.921 --> 35:34.082
<i>And this series</i>

35:34.142 --> 35:36.819
<i>of replacements isn't about</i>

35:36.851 --> 35:39.220
<i>this is black, and this white,</i>

35:39.253 --> 35:40.922
<i>this is male, and this female,</i>

35:40.956 --> 35:42.544
<i>this is rich, and this poor,</i>

35:42.583 --> 35:45.403
- this is chaos, and this...
- Control.

35:49.396 --> 35:52.838
Now that you understand that...

35:53.902 --> 35:56.771
what you really need to know is this.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.009
Life on this earth... all human life,

36:01.041 --> 36:04.712
most animal life...
is about to be crushed.

36:05.162 --> 36:07.607
Burned to the ground.

36:08.617 --> 36:11.720
The computer simulator
down the hall is necessary

36:11.753 --> 36:15.410
for our evolution as a species.

36:15.724 --> 36:17.793
When we leave this planet,

36:17.958 --> 36:20.495
this life will have evolved into that.

36:21.371 --> 36:25.069
<i>Of the hundreds of extraordinary minds</i>

36:25.108 --> 36:26.858
<i>uploaded into that world,</i>

36:26.929 --> 36:28.546
<i>the only one that figured out</i>

36:28.571 --> 36:30.108
<i>it was living in a computer simulation</i>

36:30.171 --> 36:32.673
<i>had seven billion choices</i>

36:32.812 --> 36:35.829
<i>to contact in this world.</i>

36:36.651 --> 36:40.134
And the one person Langly reached out to

36:40.479 --> 36:42.243
was you.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.540
Whoa.

36:44.853 --> 36:48.456
And to think my company
advised killing you.

36:51.016 --> 36:54.153
But now that you are once again
in front of me

36:54.510 --> 36:56.744
and aware of the simulation,

36:56.919 --> 36:59.656
I believe you won't want to destroy it,

36:59.768 --> 37:02.603
not when you understand
the good it's doing.

37:02.721 --> 37:06.341
Its reason for being is to advance life,

37:06.922 --> 37:08.977
not end it.

37:17.452 --> 37:21.056
If I were to change my course of action

37:21.147 --> 37:22.929
and, um...

37:23.157 --> 37:26.380
<i>terminate</i> my father,

37:26.810 --> 37:29.030
would I be able
to upload to the simulation?

37:30.865 --> 37:33.335
And could Agent Scully be with me?

37:37.485 --> 37:39.457
<i>It won't be her...</i>

37:40.200 --> 37:42.811
<i>and it won't be... you.</i>

37:43.723 --> 37:47.315
<i>We can upload a mind now
through any smartphone.</i>

37:47.349 --> 37:49.217
No one's even aware we're doing it.

37:49.257 --> 37:52.663
We can take a piece of your mind
any time you make a call.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.093
Painless.

37:55.424 --> 37:56.592
Two hours.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.312
Painless, except we have to die.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.998
One of our best incentives here

38:03.030 --> 38:06.302
is that you
and loved ones don't <i> ever</i> die.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.505
So if you upload me through my phone,

38:10.537 --> 38:12.474
I don't really have a choice.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.057
Sure you do.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.604
You could not use your phone.

38:16.945 --> 38:19.081
I mean, don't get me wrong.

38:19.114 --> 38:21.182
I want to believe, but...

38:21.292 --> 38:25.353
I would just like to... to see it.

38:26.253 --> 38:28.861
<i>Very few have ever seen it,</i>

38:28.926 --> 38:31.371
<i>and those that do
don't realize what it is.</i>

38:31.730 --> 38:34.028
<i>It's just a client-server.</i>

38:34.176 --> 38:36.664
<i>Wires, lights.
Why do you need to see it?</i>

38:38.378 --> 38:40.781
It's the closest I'll get to seeing God.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.854
In this life...

38:43.155 --> 38:45.018
or that.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.304
Stop. Face to the wall.

39:08.862 --> 39:10.297
Inside.

39:17.739 --> 39:19.141
Why do you operate

39:19.173 --> 39:21.208
so well with your hands cuffed
behind your back?

39:21.337 --> 39:23.178
As if you didn't know.

40:27.973 --> 40:30.090
Bye-bye, Ringo.

40:47.731 --> 40:49.100
I'm armed!

40:51.365 --> 40:52.941
Hi.

40:53.101 --> 40:54.613
What?

40:54.735 --> 40:56.952
You okay?

40:58.178 --> 41:00.441
Got my phone back.

41:01.866 --> 41:05.246
Oh. The simulator's down.

41:05.358 --> 41:06.515
Okay.

41:06.879 --> 41:08.534
Let's bring him back

41:08.599 --> 41:10.685
through the tunnel
to the FBI field office.

41:10.732 --> 41:12.652
Come back with some
cyber forensics agents

41:12.677 --> 41:16.057
and then start a case
against Erika Price.

41:17.993 --> 41:19.461
- Okay.
- Oh, I thought

41:19.486 --> 41:22.088
I was gonna throw up
for a second, but I'm okay.

41:42.022 --> 41:43.908
They're gone.

42:42.692 --> 42:45.349
<i>Mulder? Mulder!</i>

42:45.445 --> 42:47.648
<i>They know that we know!
Destroy the backup!</i>

42:49.150 --> 42:50.818
<i>Mulder, I'm afraid.</i>

42:50.903 --> 42:52.828
<i>Mulder...</i>
