WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.011
Hey. How are you doing?

00:04.088 --> 00:05.889
Been thinking about
my grandmother a lot.

00:05.957 --> 00:07.290
Yeah.

00:07.358 --> 00:09.125
She was about to turn 97.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.760
At least she lived a very long

00:10.828 --> 00:12.495
and I'm sure very happy life.

00:13.864 --> 00:15.265
Got you this card.

00:15.332 --> 00:16.700
When you're ready,
we all signed it.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.435
We just wanted you to know
we're thinking about you.

00:18.502 --> 00:21.638
Thank you.

00:21.706 --> 00:25.575
"Congratulations, Darryl.
Let's get wasted.

00:25.643 --> 00:28.144
"Have fun today, big guy.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.846
"Aww, yeah.
Party time."

00:31.882 --> 00:33.566
It's possible that some people

00:33.651 --> 00:35.385
thought it was your birthday.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.720
"Hooray.
Live it up, big d.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.888
"Days like this don't
come often enough.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.991
"Time to celebrate.

00:41.058 --> 00:42.542
You deserve this"?

00:46.864 --> 00:48.197
Birthday punches!

00:48.249 --> 00:49.499
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

00:49.550 --> 00:50.700
I'm so sorry.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.369
9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

00:53.421 --> 00:55.005
21, 22, 23, 24, 25...

01:13.426 --> 01:15.950
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

01:16.127 --> 01:19.162
So I got an early res
at blue wasabi

01:19.230 --> 01:21.097
and I'm taking Rachel.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.632
She's picking me up after work.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.100
Rachel from the party?

01:24.168 --> 01:25.535
Oh, yeah.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.736
Nice.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.238
Do the damn thing.
Pow!

01:28.305 --> 01:30.674
Blue wasabi is so good,
but get the cheeseburger.

01:30.741 --> 01:32.075
They say they won't do it,
but they will

01:32.126 --> 01:33.376
if you make a scene.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.678
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.347
- I'll miss you.
- Miss you.

01:37.414 --> 01:38.798
- Mwah.
- Okay.

01:38.883 --> 01:40.467
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

01:40.551 --> 01:42.318
Mwah.
Bye.

01:42.386 --> 01:43.586
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.255
- All right, bye. Bye.
- Bye.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.389
Okay, one more quick one.

01:46.457 --> 01:47.474
Don't go.
I don't want you to go.

01:47.558 --> 01:48.825
- Oh, don't go.
- Mwah.

01:48.893 --> 01:50.810
Don't go.

01:53.030 --> 01:57.167
Holly and I are dating.

01:57.234 --> 02:00.236
It's been a week,
and I still can't believe it.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.641
It goes to show that everything
you want in life, you get.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.509
And you can't work for it.

02:06.577 --> 02:08.011
It just comes to you.

02:08.079 --> 02:09.829
And what do we have here?

02:09.913 --> 02:12.799
From my secret admirer.
That's you.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.350
Come on.

02:14.418 --> 02:16.019
I dominate Valentine's day.

02:16.087 --> 02:18.988
I practically make romance
into a science.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.640
"Roses are red.
Violets are blue.

02:20.725 --> 02:22.625
Look in the vase to find
your first clue."

02:22.676 --> 02:25.028
Oh, my gosh.
It's a romantic scavenger hunt.

02:25.096 --> 02:26.930
Oh, close.
It's a romantic treasure hunt.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.765
A scavenger hunt is where you
find items from a master list.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.735
This is where you follow
the clues that lead to a prize.

02:31.802 --> 02:33.336
Common misuse.
Good luck.

02:33.404 --> 02:34.487
But there's no clue.

02:34.572 --> 02:35.972
Well, get to work.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.941
I can't,
'cause there's no clue.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.609
The puzzle is the clue.

02:44.749 --> 02:45.982
Are these numbers correct?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.751
The numbers are correct,
Michael.

02:47.818 --> 02:49.719
Okay.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.927
Are you...
are you sick, Oscar?

02:57.995 --> 02:59.062
Do you need to go home?

02:59.130 --> 03:00.346
'Cause you're grossing me out.

03:00.431 --> 03:04.851
I just need a signature.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.222
There you go.
Thanks.

03:09.306 --> 03:11.074
Thank you.

03:13.010 --> 03:14.110
How much did you give him?

03:14.178 --> 03:15.245
- Big tip.
- Wait.

03:15.312 --> 03:16.579
I don't have my scarf.
What?

03:16.647 --> 03:17.814
I'm missing my scarf.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.257
We decided to have
a Valentine's day lunch

03:27.324 --> 03:29.358
and then that way we can spend
the entire night with Cece

03:29.410 --> 03:33.897
and avoid the Valentine's day
dinner thing.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.331
It's a whole thing.

03:35.399 --> 03:37.901
- Yeah, lunch was wonderful!
- Shh.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.702
Um, there was an amazing buffet

03:39.753 --> 03:42.138
and there was a chocolate
fondue...Station.

03:42.206 --> 03:43.406
And what else was there?

03:43.474 --> 03:44.591
Um, bottomless champagne.

03:44.675 --> 03:46.810
Yes.

03:46.877 --> 03:48.428
Never found that bottom,
did we?

03:48.512 --> 03:49.979
No.

03:53.184 --> 03:54.400
What's up?

03:54.485 --> 03:55.685
Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.020
Are you kidding me?
It's all I did

03:57.071 --> 03:58.404
every summer when my brothers
were out sailing.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.606
Okay.

03:59.690 --> 04:00.740
But if this is
a romantic thing with Gabe,

04:00.825 --> 04:01.891
I should probably...

04:01.942 --> 04:03.359
oh!
No, no, no, no.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.828
It's not weird at all.

04:04.895 --> 04:06.446
You have your new girlfriend.
I have Gabe.

04:06.530 --> 04:07.864
This is just as friends.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.599
Well, okay then.

04:09.667 --> 04:10.900
Yes!

04:10.951 --> 04:12.735
At least until Stanley
calms down.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.954
- Oh, is he...
- D-d-d-d-d-don't look.

04:15.039 --> 04:17.790
I accidentally did his sudoku.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.909
Andy.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.278
All right.
I will fax over it to you.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.098
Whoop.
I will fax it over to you.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.883
Okay.
Thank you.

04:28.752 --> 04:33.022
Okay, my name is
j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-Jim Halpert

04:33.090 --> 04:35.124
and I will fax it in to you...

04:35.192 --> 04:36.759
under you.
I'll fax it under you.

04:36.827 --> 04:37.994
Oh, excuse me.

04:38.062 --> 04:41.430
I just p-p-p-p-pissed
my pants.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.699
Not really.
I didn't really.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.737
Wait.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.305
You're just filling
that out right now.

04:49.373 --> 04:51.574
That wasn't meant for me.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.126
I will not be your Valentine.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.644
Aww, nuts.

04:56.247 --> 04:59.015
I don't know if anyone else
feels this way...

04:59.083 --> 05:00.383
and don't get me wrong...

05:00.450 --> 05:02.819
I love Michael and Holly.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.787
And maybe I'm being
overly sensitive...

05:04.855 --> 05:06.856
But the PDA.

05:06.924 --> 05:08.508
Yes!
The freaking PDA!

05:08.592 --> 05:10.593
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.145
I mean, I'm thrilled for them.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.696
No one is more thrilled
for them than I am...

05:13.764 --> 05:15.265
Yes.
Yes, absolutely.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.599
But it's totally inappropriate.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.301
Yeah, it's a little much.

05:19.603 --> 05:21.070
Obviously so happy
for them both.

05:21.138 --> 05:22.655
So happy.
Yeah.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.907
I don't know, guys.

05:23.974 --> 05:25.474
I, for one,
enjoy watching them, because...

05:25.526 --> 05:27.043
- No, stop. Just don't.
- Kevin!

05:27.111 --> 05:29.779
Can I finish? Can I finish?
Is that okay?

05:29.847 --> 05:32.215
I was saying...

05:32.283 --> 05:34.817
I enjoy watching them

05:34.868 --> 05:36.703
because it makes me horny.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.022
God! Kevin!

05:39.089 --> 05:41.341
So tell me
about your new girlfriend.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.959
She's neat.

05:43.027 --> 05:44.794
Uh, I met her
at Darryl's cousin's party.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.229
We were the only two
white people there.

05:46.297 --> 05:48.164
Aww, cute.

05:48.232 --> 05:50.033
Hey, look at that.
Done.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.567
That's Gabe's boom box.

05:51.635 --> 05:53.669
Come on. We have to go find it.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.638
I wish you well on your quest.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.640
- No, come on.
- Aww, I mean...

05:57.708 --> 05:59.309
come on!

05:59.360 --> 06:01.244
- Okay.
- Ha!

06:01.312 --> 06:03.029
I hear them kissing
all the time.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.948
It's this horrible
plipping sound.

06:05.015 --> 06:06.482
You know,
it's like Chinese water torture.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.867
Just...

06:07.952 --> 06:09.685
Like it's coming
from my own head.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.854
Sit.

06:11.905 --> 06:15.258
Okay, just close your eyes.
Ohh.

06:15.326 --> 06:16.726
Can you get lower?

06:16.794 --> 06:19.262
- Oh, yeah.
- A little lower.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.331
I cannot keep myself
from Michael.

06:21.398 --> 06:24.100
Everything he does is sexy.

06:24.168 --> 06:27.053
He has this undeniable
animal magnetism.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.372
He's a jungle cat.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.541
The man exudes sex.

06:31.608 --> 06:35.845
He can put both his legs
behind his head.

06:35.913 --> 06:37.713
Thank you all for meeting
on such short notice.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.115
Yes?

06:39.183 --> 06:41.050
Yes.
Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.685
What is the purpose
of this meeting?

06:42.753 --> 06:44.354
Seeing as it's Valentine's day,

06:44.421 --> 06:46.155
I felt it would be
apropos to have

06:46.223 --> 06:48.891
a little refresher course
on romance in the workplace.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.059
Perfect.
Yes.

06:50.127 --> 06:52.445
It is quite apro-propriate.
Carry on.

06:52.529 --> 06:53.830
First things first.

06:53.897 --> 06:55.565
An office romance
is permissible.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.900
Not something you'd expect
to hear from corporate?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.135
Well, guess what.

06:59.203 --> 07:02.305
Sabre is 100% tolerant
of office romances.

07:02.373 --> 07:03.623
Speaking of, Gabe,

07:03.707 --> 07:05.208
I don't see Erin
at this meeting.

07:05.275 --> 07:07.377
Uh, I also don't see Andy.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.848
Boom!
Face!

07:11.915 --> 07:12.932
I get it.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.017
Andy's slamming my girlfriend.

07:14.084 --> 07:15.551
Very funny.

07:15.619 --> 07:17.053
What I do not approve of,
however,

07:17.121 --> 07:19.188
is public displays
of affection,

07:19.256 --> 07:20.289
or PDAs.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.026
PDAs are totally superfluous

07:23.093 --> 07:24.994
to a happy,
healthy office romance.

07:25.062 --> 07:26.996
Perfect example.
Look at Jim and Pam.

07:27.064 --> 07:29.766
Yeah?
What?

07:29.833 --> 07:30.900
Us?
They don't touch.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.535
They don't kiss.

07:32.603 --> 07:33.536
You would hardly even know
that they

07:33.603 --> 07:34.603
were husband and wife.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.905
- Did it.
- Yeah!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.140
Love it.
Keep going.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.108
Okay.
So, PDAs.

07:39.159 --> 07:42.278
That's gonna include behaviors
such as hugging, kissing,

07:43.447 --> 07:44.580
Booby honking.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.832
Yeah, booby honking.
Sure.

07:45.916 --> 07:46.916
Butt honking.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.217
Butt honking.
Yeah, all the honkings.

07:48.285 --> 07:49.152
The one where you start
in a crouched position,

07:49.219 --> 07:50.520
then you leap...
Sure.

07:50.587 --> 07:52.688
Basically, there's
no precise definition,

07:52.756 --> 07:54.557
but you know it
when you see it.

07:58.262 --> 08:02.298
Are you guys listening to this?

08:02.366 --> 08:04.834
What, are you talking
about me and Holly?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.352
Yeah!

08:06.437 --> 08:10.818
Maybe you find your own chair.

08:11.894 --> 08:13.270
So we kiss occasionally...

08:13.414 --> 08:14.791
Occasionally? All the time.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.214
Yeah, and it's not
just the kissing.

08:16.298 --> 08:18.082
It's the flirtatious whispering.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.600
The flirtatious tickling.

08:19.668 --> 08:22.703
Whispering and tickling
have their place in business.

08:22.771 --> 08:26.607
That thing where you
softly exhale on her neck.

08:26.675 --> 08:28.276
Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot.

08:28.343 --> 08:29.260
I will give you that.

08:29.344 --> 08:31.312
Look, you are all hypocrites.

08:31.379 --> 08:33.548
You all do it.
Michael.

08:33.615 --> 08:35.515
I have done PDA in the office.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.051
Thank you.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.553
I've had intercourse
in the office.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.104
- All right.
- As has Angela.

08:40.188 --> 08:41.422
- Dwight.
- As has Ryan.

08:41.490 --> 08:43.222
As has Kelly.
As has Meredith.

08:43.275 --> 08:44.358
As has Phyllis.

08:44.409 --> 08:45.660
As has Darryl.

08:45.727 --> 08:47.595
As has creed.
As has Michael.

08:47.663 --> 08:49.864
And as has Holly.
As has Kevin.

08:49.932 --> 08:51.165
With who?

08:51.232 --> 08:53.134
She goes to another school.

08:53.201 --> 08:55.369
Okay. Fine.
No more PDA.

08:55.437 --> 08:56.871
- Good.
- You win.

08:56.922 --> 08:58.706
But here's what we are gonna do.

08:58.757 --> 08:59.874
We are going to designate

08:59.925 --> 09:01.542
one of our closets
as a hook-up zone.

09:01.610 --> 09:02.760
- No.
- Anything goes.

09:02.844 --> 09:03.778
Just leave it how you said...

09:03.845 --> 09:05.379
Michael, that's absurd.

09:05.430 --> 09:06.964
What if two couples want
to go at the same time?

09:07.049 --> 09:08.432
Okay, then we have two closets.

09:08.517 --> 09:09.800
No, no, we're gonna have
three closets,

09:09.885 --> 09:12.620
one for each base, no homers.
Yes?

09:12.688 --> 09:15.723
- And what is the hook-up zone
policy on masturbation?

09:15.791 --> 09:17.942
- Pro.
- Yes.

09:18.026 --> 09:19.560
What?
Problem solved.

09:19.628 --> 09:20.628
No, no, it's great.

09:20.696 --> 09:22.262
I love working
at Dunder Mifflin,

09:22.314 --> 09:25.483
a division
of Taliban enterprises.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.068
That is weird.

09:27.135 --> 09:30.638
I mean, that's weird
to have sex in the office.

09:30.706 --> 09:32.039
That's where you work, right?

09:34.009 --> 09:35.776
You know, you're in a meeting,

09:35.844 --> 09:39.180
and nobody knows
that you've had sex there,

09:39.247 --> 09:40.848
except for you and him.

09:46.154 --> 09:48.472
Don't mind us.
You keep working.

09:48.557 --> 09:50.975
Okay.
I'll keep working.

09:51.059 --> 09:53.961
Oh, my God.

09:54.012 --> 09:55.096
It's a song.

09:56.848 --> 09:58.499
What do you think is on it?

09:58.567 --> 10:00.768
We should actually probably
talk about it outside

10:00.819 --> 10:02.703
or we might make Darryl mad.

10:02.771 --> 10:04.188
Not if we're talking like this.

10:04.272 --> 10:07.241
I think it's okay.
He doesn't seem to hear us.

10:07.309 --> 10:09.377
I think he's just being nice.

10:09.444 --> 10:11.512
That makes sense,
'cause I feel like I'd be able

10:11.580 --> 10:12.780
to hear us at this level.

10:12.831 --> 10:16.217
Darryl.
Darryl is a jerk.

10:16.284 --> 10:18.119
- No, he's not.
- No, I'm just testing

10:18.186 --> 10:19.720
if he can hear.
I can hear you.

10:19.788 --> 10:21.005
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay. Then no more talking.

10:21.089 --> 10:22.656
Let's just play the song.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.493
♪ The temp at night ♪

10:25.560 --> 10:27.495
♪ the temp at night ♪

10:27.562 --> 10:29.680
♪ the temp at night ♪

10:29.765 --> 10:31.682
♪ the temp at night ♪

10:31.767 --> 10:34.969
Temp at night?

10:35.020 --> 10:36.053
What do you...

10:36.138 --> 10:38.105
you got it.

10:38.173 --> 10:39.407
Pick it up.
Take it out.

10:39.474 --> 10:40.474
Pi...

10:40.542 --> 10:42.076
- pick it up.
- Okay.

10:42.144 --> 10:43.678
Take it out.
Pick it up.

10:43.745 --> 10:45.112
Pick it up.

10:45.180 --> 10:46.680
Pick it up.
Take it out.

10:46.732 --> 10:48.866
Right.
Okay.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.994
Sorry to interrupt.

11:00.045 --> 11:01.829
Forgot to collect my things.

11:01.897 --> 11:04.999
Ah, the old "leave behind."
Oldest trick in the book.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.867
Good thing it's working.
Oh, no.

11:06.918 --> 11:08.886
Michael, I don't want
to make people uncomfortable.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.539
Since when is comfort
the most important thing?

11:11.606 --> 11:14.475
I mean, I don't sit on your lap
because it's comfortable.

11:14.543 --> 11:15.876
I sit on your lap
because I like the way

11:15.944 --> 11:17.211
your thighs feel on my butt.

11:17.279 --> 11:18.846
Yeah,
but if they're uncomfortable,

11:18.914 --> 11:20.114
it makes me uncomfortable.

11:20.182 --> 11:21.849
Oh. Okay.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.485
Well, if it makes you
uncomfortable,

11:24.553 --> 11:26.020
then we'll stop.
Okay.

11:26.071 --> 11:27.855
Holly and I
are like Romeo and Juliet.

11:27.923 --> 11:31.225
And this office is like the
dragon that kept them apart.

11:31.293 --> 11:33.727
Hey.
You know the only reason

11:33.779 --> 11:35.079
why people here
are complaining?

11:35.163 --> 11:38.199
They are jealous of two people

11:38.250 --> 11:39.750
in love on Valentine's day.

11:39.835 --> 11:43.704
Two people in love?

11:43.755 --> 11:45.740
I love you.

11:45.807 --> 11:47.074
Wait, wait, wait,
what do you mean

11:47.125 --> 11:48.709
you love me?

11:48.777 --> 11:50.261
We've only been dating
for a week.

11:50.345 --> 11:52.747
Do you mean you love me
like, "oh, hey, there's Holly.

11:52.814 --> 11:54.849
I love that girl,"
or do you mean

11:54.916 --> 11:57.768
you love me
like you love me-love me?

11:57.853 --> 11:59.954
- I love you-love you.

12:00.021 --> 12:03.591
- Wow, you love me-love me.

12:05.127 --> 12:08.062
I love you-love you.

12:20.542 --> 12:24.011
I am really disappointed
in the office's policy

12:24.079 --> 12:26.163
on PDA at this moment.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.638
I love you.
I love you.

12:38.977 --> 12:41.495
Yeah, whatever.
No big deal.

12:41.563 --> 12:46.350
Just the hottest girl
in the world loves me.

12:49.237 --> 12:50.971
Okay, Ryan's the temp.
What does he do at night?

12:51.022 --> 12:54.942
I guess we just have to wait
until night and see.

12:54.993 --> 12:59.079
Oh.
Or maybe not.

13:02.517 --> 13:05.452
Cool.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.039
- How romantic is this?
- Super romantic.

13:09.124 --> 13:11.325
Right?

13:11.393 --> 13:14.228
Do you see a clue or...
Yeah. Did you not see it?

13:14.296 --> 13:16.163
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hanks.

13:19.401 --> 13:20.801
Hey.
No time to chat.

13:20.852 --> 13:22.353
- Sorry.
- Well, we were just looking

13:22.437 --> 13:23.804
for Ryan, so he's not here.

13:23.855 --> 13:25.172
Hey.
You're looking for me?

13:25.223 --> 13:27.358
Oh, yeah, we were.
We were just looking to say hi.

13:27.442 --> 13:29.860
So hey.

13:29.945 --> 13:31.679
- No, you weren't.
- No, we weren't.

13:31.746 --> 13:33.347
You wanted to have sex
in my office.

13:33.398 --> 13:34.815
- No.
- Definitely not.

13:34.866 --> 13:36.817
That's disgusting.
It's cool.

13:36.868 --> 13:38.953
Just try to put everything back

13:39.020 --> 13:40.237
where you found it.

13:40.322 --> 13:41.688
Text me when you're finished.

13:41.740 --> 13:42.689
I'll be out here.

13:42.741 --> 13:45.526
Hey, you don't have to...

13:45.594 --> 13:47.394
That was so embarrassing
I'm gonna die.

13:47.462 --> 13:52.800
That was really rough.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.385
Let me make something clear.

13:54.469 --> 13:58.138
Jim and I have never and will
never have sex in the office.

13:58.206 --> 14:00.641
No, because the office
isn't what I'd consider

14:00.708 --> 14:03.727
a romantic place.

14:03.812 --> 14:06.213
Besides, we have something
those other people don't have,

14:06.264 --> 14:08.616
which is a home and a bed.

14:08.683 --> 14:12.152
And a shower.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.720
- Hello, Holly.
- Hello.

14:13.772 --> 14:14.888
Here, shake... no!

14:14.940 --> 14:16.907
- No, don't touch.
- No, we can't.

14:16.992 --> 14:19.226
- No touching.
- No touching.

14:19.277 --> 14:22.062
Ah, I'm trying
not to touch you.

14:23.331 --> 14:25.916
- Almost got you.
- Oh, no, so close.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.902
Oh.
No, we can't do that.

14:27.969 --> 14:29.470
We can't do this.
Ohh.

14:29.537 --> 14:30.788
You're not touching me.

14:30.872 --> 14:33.173
I don't know
what your body feels like.

14:33.241 --> 14:34.908
'Cause I can't touch it.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.743
Okay, this is much worse
than before.

14:36.795 --> 14:38.796
Yeah, I agree.
This is nasty.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.681
- Grab you here.
- And here.

14:40.748 --> 14:43.083
And I will grab you here
anyway.

14:43.134 --> 14:45.119
You have to cut it out.

14:45.186 --> 14:46.303
- Never.
- Okay.

14:46.388 --> 14:48.455
You said you would.
I did say I would,

14:48.523 --> 14:50.424
but I was wrong.
I can't stop.

14:50.492 --> 14:54.111
You don't know what it is like
to love a woman

14:54.195 --> 14:55.312
and have her love you back.

14:55.397 --> 14:58.699
It is a feeling that cannot
and will not

14:58.767 --> 15:02.069
and frankly cannot be contained.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.772
No one is a bigger fan
of sexual touching than me.

15:05.824 --> 15:08.959
But with you two, it's reaching
the level of a complex.

15:09.044 --> 15:11.128
I can think
of three explanations.

15:11.212 --> 15:14.648
You're taking MDMA...
street name, ecstasy.

15:14.716 --> 15:16.250
I've done it,
and I know the feeling.

15:16.318 --> 15:18.319
No. I don't think so.

15:18.386 --> 15:20.888
You're desperately trying

15:20.956 --> 15:22.622
to fit in a whole relationship

15:22.674 --> 15:24.024
before Toby comes back
from jury duty

15:24.092 --> 15:26.927
and Holly has to go back
to nashua.

15:26.995 --> 15:30.014
You're at an age

15:30.098 --> 15:33.133
where your sexual climaxes
aren't as powerful

15:33.201 --> 15:35.703
so you need to overcompensate

15:35.770 --> 15:38.539
with foreplay, taboo behavior.

15:38.606 --> 15:41.675
Yes, it was that.

15:41.743 --> 15:43.754
It's that one.
Yes. Number three.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.381
Give me all your money
and take off your clothes.

15:49.672 --> 15:51.089
We're not supposed to PDA.

15:51.157 --> 15:53.992
Come on.
Nobody's looking.

15:59.899 --> 16:05.053
What's wrong?

16:05.138 --> 16:09.691
I hadn't thought about you
having to go back to nashua.

16:09.776 --> 16:12.894
Maybe we didn't want
to think about it.

16:12.979 --> 16:14.780
We can make it work.
We'll date long-distance.

16:14.847 --> 16:16.281
That's what we said last time.

16:16.349 --> 16:17.616
Remember?

16:17.683 --> 16:21.353
We broke up on the drive.

16:21.404 --> 16:22.621
How's this gonna be
any different?

16:22.688 --> 16:23.872
We weren't in love last time.

16:23.957 --> 16:25.407
I was in love with you.

16:25.491 --> 16:29.061
I'm not saying
it won't be hard.

16:29.128 --> 16:31.430
But we can make it work.

16:31.497 --> 16:33.048
That's what she said.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.705
One Erin special, please.

16:40.757 --> 16:42.591
Here's your bottle
of sparkling cider.

16:42.675 --> 16:44.476
That's my favorite.

16:44.544 --> 16:45.761
I'm now supposed to tell you

16:45.845 --> 16:50.315
to enjoy a mid-hunt break
and look for a heart

16:50.383 --> 16:53.618
or some [Bleep] In the break
room when you're through.

16:54.887 --> 16:56.254
Hey, buck up, buddy.

16:56.322 --> 17:00.292
Make that face he likes.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.495
Hey. Hey. Come on.
You're hurting him.

17:06.699 --> 17:08.165
It's like a time bomb...

17:08.233 --> 17:09.667
- Shh.
- Is ticking down.

17:09.736 --> 17:11.953
When it goes off,
no more kissing.

17:12.038 --> 17:14.006
No more hugging.
Just hush.

17:14.073 --> 17:15.757
Sexual time bomb.

17:15.842 --> 17:20.912
Just rock.
Shh.

17:20.963 --> 17:22.914
<i>Boner bomb
starring Jason Statham.</i>

17:22.982 --> 17:24.516
Or we go against type
with an Eisenberg

17:24.584 --> 17:25.684
or a Michael Cera.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.285
- Movie idea?
- No.

17:27.353 --> 17:30.555
Saving the world
has never been this hard.

17:30.606 --> 17:33.091
Okay.
Shh.

17:33.142 --> 17:34.592
Have you talked to her
about our feelings?

17:34.644 --> 17:35.894
Women really go for that crap.

17:35.945 --> 17:37.295
No, I can't talk to her.

17:37.363 --> 17:38.296
I can't even look at her

17:38.364 --> 17:42.601
without thinking
about it ending.

17:42.668 --> 17:45.537
Kevin.
Do more stupid faces.

17:45.604 --> 17:48.306
Which one?
I have a lot of stupid faces.

17:48.374 --> 17:49.674
- I don't know.
- Do the monkey face.

17:49.742 --> 17:52.444
- Do a monkey face.
- I love that.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.463
I love that face.
Good. He loves it.

17:56.883 --> 17:59.167
Good. Jump.
Jump up and down.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.919
- No. The monkey!
- Go back to the monkey.

18:00.970 --> 18:02.120
Don't do the squirrel.

18:02.188 --> 18:03.472
Throw your poop.

18:03.556 --> 18:04.806
Hurl your feces.

18:04.891 --> 18:06.291
That's good.

18:06.359 --> 18:07.459
- Good.
- That's good. He's throwing it.

18:07.510 --> 18:08.793
They really do that.

18:08.845 --> 18:10.062
I know.

18:10.129 --> 18:11.897
- B-9.
- B-9.

18:11.964 --> 18:13.231
Like benign tumor.

18:13.299 --> 18:16.318
Maybe it's just more like,
"be mine."

18:16.402 --> 18:17.736
Oh, yes.

18:17.803 --> 18:18.970
There's a note.

18:19.021 --> 18:20.939
"A little cookie
for you, my miss.

18:21.007 --> 18:24.209
But the real treasure
is your Valentine's kiss."

18:26.746 --> 18:30.031
Oh.
We're supposed to...

18:46.132 --> 18:47.599
Holly. Hey.

18:47.666 --> 18:50.035
- Hi.
- Holly, I love you

18:50.103 --> 18:51.887
so, so, so much.

18:51.971 --> 18:53.772
And I think
that we need to break up.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.774
What?
What are you talking about?

18:55.842 --> 18:58.276
Actually it's Valentine's day.
Shouldn't be doing this today.

18:58.344 --> 19:00.479
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
No, we're gonna talk now.

19:00.546 --> 19:02.214
You're not breaking up with me.

19:02.281 --> 19:06.535
You're gonna go back
to nashua eventually,

19:06.619 --> 19:07.686
and I can't handle it.

19:07.753 --> 19:10.322
So let's just...
let's...

19:10.373 --> 19:11.957
what if I said
it wasn't up to them?

19:12.024 --> 19:14.426
- Who?
- The company.

19:14.494 --> 19:16.128
Nobody knows our future,

19:16.195 --> 19:18.396
but it's not gonna be decided
by the company.

19:18.464 --> 19:21.032
It's not gonna be decided
by anybody but us.

19:21.100 --> 19:26.371
What we are
is up to you and me.

19:26.439 --> 19:28.573
Okay. Okay.

19:30.476 --> 19:33.545
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement to make.

19:33.596 --> 19:37.149
As of today, officially,

19:37.216 --> 19:39.217
Holly and I
are moving in together.

19:40.486 --> 19:42.320
Thank you. Thank you.

19:42.388 --> 19:45.824
Oscar, this must be tough
for you, watching this go down.

19:45.892 --> 19:48.493
You could not stand in the way
of true love, my friend.

19:48.561 --> 19:49.744
Are you kidding?
I wasn't trying

19:49.829 --> 19:50.996
to break you guys up.

19:51.063 --> 19:52.564
Better luck next time, pal.

19:52.632 --> 19:54.616
Well, the point is,
there will no longer be

19:54.700 --> 19:57.402
any need for PDA here
at the office

19:57.470 --> 19:59.771
between us because,
when we get home,

19:59.839 --> 20:03.775
we are going to make love to
and with one another,

20:03.843 --> 20:07.345
and that, to me, is the best
Valentine's day present

20:07.413 --> 20:09.464
that a person could receive.

20:09.549 --> 20:11.916
So I bid you all adieu.

20:11.968 --> 20:14.135
- You do?
- I do.

20:14.220 --> 20:16.655
Go on.
Kiss each other already.

20:19.158 --> 20:20.475
Suck it, Oscar.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.094
This must kill you.
I just told them to do it.

20:34.774 --> 20:37.642
- What?
- No.

20:37.710 --> 20:39.711
No.
We took a walk.

20:39.779 --> 20:41.254
We took a walk.

20:45.204 --> 20:46.671
My perfect Valentine's day?

20:46.739 --> 20:49.941
I'm at home, three cell phones
in front of me,

20:50.009 --> 20:51.843
fielding desperate calls
from people who want

20:51.911 --> 20:53.878
to buy one of
the 50 restaurant reservations

20:53.946 --> 20:56.314
I made over six months ago.

20:56.382 --> 20:58.350
Anybody can be prince charming

20:58.417 --> 21:02.357
one day a year with the dinner
and the flowers and all that.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.117
But you know what impresses me?

21:04.152 --> 21:07.304
When a guy can do
that no days a year.

21:08.687 --> 21:11.142
Flowers, diamonds,
three course meal...

21:11.384 --> 21:13.776
Violinist comes to
my table to serenate me...

21:13.990 --> 21:16.369
Pizza, soda, the moon,

21:16.487 --> 21:18.062
someone to share it with...

21:18.375 --> 21:19.766
What are our plans for tonight?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.526
