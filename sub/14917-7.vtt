00:25.950 --> 00:27.040
- Justin!
- I'm sorry.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.370
How long have you been standing there?

00:28.410 --> 00:29.550
A few seconds.
I don't know.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.100
I was just listening to you hum in there.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.450
Do you know how creepy that is?

00:32.470 --> 00:34.790
- it's not creepy.
- No,I'm serious.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.940
I-I know I gave you a key,but next time maybe you could knock,

00:36.980 --> 00:39.690
ring the doorbell,give me a little warning?

00:42.340 --> 00:44.160
What?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.620
I love you.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.070
Becca,I do.
I...

00:49.100 --> 00:50.760
I love you.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Wow,justin.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.870
Thank you.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.480
I better go get dressed.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.550
Radio interview at 10:00.
More election predictions.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.600
Okay.Then you've got the call about the renewable energy statute.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.870
What's the tracking on that today?

01:08.900 --> 01:10.200
- Up 4.
- Excellent.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.400
Oh,speaking of what's on the ballot,

01:12.430 --> 01:14.060
I prepared a statement against prop 8.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.510
I'm already on the record against that.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.720
I know you've only been here a week,

01:16.760 --> 01:19.800
but the senator released his position on the limited marriage act four months ago.

01:19.860 --> 01:21.400
Well,no one remembers four months ago.

01:21.430 --> 01:22.490
People are paying attention now.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.280
- Look,we realize this is your issue！
- my issue?

01:26.310 --> 01:30.760
The supreme court of california ruled it is illegal to discriminate against gay marriage.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.740
Now forgive me if I'm wrong,robert,I thought

01:32.780 --> 01:36.120
you republicans were all about respecting state's rights.

01:36.150 --> 01:37.710
He's got you on that,stu.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.920
sorry to interrupt you,senator.
Your 2:00 got pushed to noon.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.320
- Tell 'em he's busy.
- No,no,I-i have to be at that.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.360
Um,kevin,I agree with stu.

01:45.390 --> 01:48.380
We've already released our statement on prop 8.
We're not coming out again.

01:48.410 --> 01:49.470
- No pun intended.
- Yeah.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.280
Oh,and I'm gonna take the radio interview in the car.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.340
And tell him about the other...

01:55.800 --> 01:58.610
- all right,kitty's brother.
- You can call me kevin.

01:58.650 --> 02:01.570
When you start referring to your boss as "senator," I will.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.440
In the meantime,talk to this reporter from the "sacramento tribune."

02:04.480 --> 02:06.720
He's threatening to publish some cockamamy story about

02:06.750 --> 02:11.850
governor kern and the senator involved in some sort of intimate relationship.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.640
What kind of intimate relationship?

02:13.660 --> 02:15.780
The schtupping kind.
The story is he's schtupping her.

02:15.810 --> 02:19.380
Yeah,I know what schtupping is.
That's ridiculous.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.990
Isn't ?

02:22.010 --> 02:24.230
Let me know how it goes.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.670
woW.I just- I can't believe it is actually happening.I mean,

02:33.710 --> 02:35.530
of course,it should've happened ten minutes ago.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.580
- Do you think anything's wrong?
- No,no.

02:36.630 --> 02:39.090
I--I'm sure she's just still in her appointment,

02:39.130 --> 02:41.180
and she'll be here as soon as she can.

02:41.210 --> 02:44.290
Well,I hope she's not lost.
I mean,this hospital is like a maze.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.730
You know,robert,I-I think we should've brought her a gift.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.410
I mean,m-maternity clothes are insanely expensive,

02:49.450 --> 02:51.470
and she shouldn't have to pay for that all by herself.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.730
This is just her first visit.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.840
She's probably young and might not have a lot money.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.680
We're gonna have plenty of time to,you know,shower her with gifts.

03:01.250 --> 03:04.110
you're right.You're right.
Thank you.I'M...

03:04.130 --> 03:05.310
you're right.

03:10.610 --> 03:12.050
- hi.
- Hi.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.340
I'm so sorry.I-I thought that we reserved this room for a private meeting.

03:15.370 --> 03:19.230
- W-we did.Sorry.
- Oh,well,with me.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.940
I'm trish evans,your birth M.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.450
Oh.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.320
Oh--oh,wow.
yeah.

03:27.350 --> 03:30.090
It's,uh,it's so-- it's so nice to meet you.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.580
Yes.
Yeah,indeed,doctor.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.180
Screw holly.

03:39.210 --> 03:41.030
I'm out of the closet now,remember?

03:41.060 --> 03:44.270
You should've seen her,wielding george lafferty's phone number around

03:44.300 --> 03:46.870
as if it was some weapon against my filY.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.620
I know.
You were terrified.

03:48.650 --> 03:50.150
Well,I was.

03:50.180 --> 03:54.250
Bringing william's illegitimate son into the mix was not something I wanted to do,

03:54.290 --> 03:56.930
and ha ha,too bad for holly,it's not gonna happen.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.480
What are you making anyway?

03:58.490 --> 04:01.390
Cupcakes for tommy and julia's party tonight.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.780
I'm not saying telling george waeasy.It wasn'T.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.030
He was devastated at first,and then,in the end,

04:06.060 --> 04:08.480
he decided he didn't want ryan to know anything about it.

04:08.510 --> 04:12.380
Even if william is ryan's biological father,

04:12.410 --> 04:14.180
george raised him.That's all that matters.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.600
Right.Okay.
So pick a card.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.029
Are you even listening to me?

04:17.060 --> 04:20.269
George lafferty doesn't want anything to do with our family.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.620
The whole sordid business is over,done,poof.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.740
Right,exactly,poof.
Now come on,pick a card.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.540
All right,remember what it is.
Okay,you got it?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.610
- Yeah.
- Put it back.Don't tell me.

04:30.740 --> 04:31.900
Great.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.480
You're like a child.

04:33.510 --> 04:36.260
You're so excited we're going to magic manor tonight.

04:36.290 --> 04:38.370
The last time I went there,tommy was 10 years old,

04:38.400 --> 04:40.450
and I taught him his first trick.
Yes,I'm excited.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.310
He's celebrating his anniversary there tonight.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.680
Are you kidding?

04:47.270 --> 04:48.730
hello.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.470
George.

04:54.110 --> 04:55.540
Oh,no.No,no,no,I w--

04:55.570 --> 04:58.120
I was just thinking about you.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.140
Now?

05:01.610 --> 05:03.400
Really?Um,

05:03.430 --> 05:05.120
okay.Could--could--

05:05.150 --> 05:07.190
could you do it over here?

05:07.220 --> 05:09.610
Okay.
Fine.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.280
S-- ee you in a while.

05:12.090 --> 05:13.580
What?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.810
He's having second thoughts.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.770
He's--he's thinking maybe he should tell ryan the truth.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.990
- There goes poof.
- Oh.

05:28.050 --> 05:31.020
Take it from your reaction,you didn't read my application.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.120
- No,but we did.
- No,we did.

05:32.150 --> 05:32.980
- We read it,like,you know...
- a lot.

05:33.010 --> 05:34.500
- A lot.
- A hundred timeS.

05:34.530 --> 05:37.350
I think that when you said your goal was to become a surgeon,

05:37.380 --> 05:39.300
we didn't know that you actually were a surgeon.

05:39.330 --> 05:42.550
Yeah,we thought it was,uh,more of a long-term thing...

05:42.570 --> 05:44.510
And,you know,that you were still a student in missouri.

05:44.550 --> 05:47.380
Well,I'm from missouri,but I'm doing my residency here.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.610
It's a great surprise.
What's your specialty?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.410
- Neuro.
- Wow,a-a brain surgeon.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.450
Not yet.
I'm only in my second year.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.830
Congratulations.
This is gonna be a smart baby.

05:57.860 --> 05:58.500
yeah.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.060
I can only speak for half of the chromosomes.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.280
Oh,so the father wasn't exactly a neurosurgeon himself?

06:03.310 --> 06:05.040
Honey,the father was listed as "unknown."

06:05.080 --> 06:05.840
I know.

06:05.870 --> 06:08.700
We hooked up at a conference.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.600
- Uh,not my finest hour.
- It happens.

06:11.620 --> 06:14.370
And--and I know you guys said,uh,ethnicity doesn't matter.

06:14.390 --> 06:14.650
No.

06:14.670 --> 06:19.210
But he was white,and my mom's korean and my dad's black,so,uh,

06:19.250 --> 06:22.530
guess you're in for a surprise.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.320
yeah,so,um,brain surgery.that-

06:25.350 --> 06:27.070
That--that must be a lot of hard work?

06:27.110 --> 06:29.280
Is--is that why you made an adoption plan?

06:29.300 --> 06:30.640
Medicine's my baby.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.340
I don't have the tim or energy for another.

06:34.230 --> 06:37.450
Was--was that decision difficult?

06:37.480 --> 06:39.080
Mm,not really.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.580
I weighed the pros and cons,and for me,adoption made sense.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.840
Right,right.
And how about your family?

06:45.870 --> 06:47.480
Oh,completely supportive.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.930
You won't have any long-lost relatives bugging you.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.410
Oh,we're--we're not at all worried about that.

06:52.450 --> 06:55.110
Yeah,no,I didn't-- I didn't mean it like that.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.200
oh,it's the E.R.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.940
You guys are great.

07:00.970 --> 07:03.170
I feel really good about this.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.690
- I gotta run.
- No,no,wait,wait.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.850
I-I feel like we--we-- we just got started.

07:07.870 --> 07:08.770
Um,is that it?

07:08.800 --> 07:12.840
I have to travel to houston for a seminar tomorrow.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.460
I could do dinner.

07:14.490 --> 07:16.220
We have the anniversary,but we could cancel.

07:16.260 --> 07:19.020
Oh,no,but this is much more important.
No,that would be great.

07:19.060 --> 07:23.560
Okay,I'll call you guys when whatever train wreck downstairs is over.How's that?

07:23.600 --> 07:24.410
- Okay.
- Fantastic.

07:24.450 --> 07:25.570
- All right,great.
- Thanks.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.100
Thank you.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.520
- She is fantastic.
- Yeah.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.490
- She's perfect.
- Yeah.No,she is.

07:33.510 --> 07:35.300
What,you don't think so?

07:35.320 --> 07:38.460
What?
No.I'm--I-I just,you know,I...

07:38.490 --> 07:41.380
she--she did not admit to having any doubt.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.180
Don't you think that's a little weird?

07:43.210 --> 07:45.510
No,I don't think it's weird.
I think it's decisive.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.980
Look,this-- honey,this is all good.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.540
Don't overthink it.
Really.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.340
- Okay?
- Yeah.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.180
It's great.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.950
Okay.All right,I gotta go.
I'll see you later.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.300
- George,can't I get you a cup of tea?
- No,that's okay.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.430
I-I really don't want to take up too much of your time.

08:00.460 --> 08:03.230
Oh,that's okay.
I'm the one who opened pandora's box.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.620
What is it they say,ignorance is bliss?

08:05.650 --> 08:09.010
Yes,ignorance is bliss--total and complete and utter bliss.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.380
George,maybe you were right the first time.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.100
Maybe you should put it all back in the box,lock it up,throw away the key.

08:13.130 --> 08:15.230
Let the past be the past.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.100
That's what I thought I wanted.

08:17.130 --> 08:21.190
Then ryacalled,and the whole conversation,I felt like I was lying to him.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.000
You wanted to protect him.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.340
That was your first instinct.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.780
George,I think you should go with that instit.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.700
I don't know.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.900
Sometimes I think it's me I'm trying to protect.

08:31.930 --> 08:33.809
R-ryan struggled growing up.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.510
He never felt like he fit in.

08:36.539 --> 08:38.440
Is this why?

08:38.470 --> 08:41.299
Would knowing help him make sense of things?

08:41.330 --> 08:44.210
And then I think again how hard he took his mother's death.

08:44.240 --> 08:49.260
And now to tell him his whole identity was based on a lie-- a lie she told him--

08:49.290 --> 08:51.740
I don't think he can handle that.

08:51.770 --> 08:53.710
That's why I called you.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.490
That's why I can't sleep at night.

09:00.980 --> 09:03.020
it's the cupcakes.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.350
And you really look like you could use one.

09:06.950 --> 09:09.510
at this point,I could eat the whole batch.

09:10.510 --> 09:13.060
well,let's just start with one.

09:14.150 --> 09:15.810
yeah.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.240
- Kevin walker?
- Yes.

09:17.270 --> 09:20.820
- Spencer travis from the "sacramento tribune."
- Thanks for coming by.

09:20.850 --> 09:22.610
Take a seat.

09:22.630 --> 09:26.560
It's good to see that nepotism's alive and well.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.480
Okay,let's set the record straight.Um,

09:28.520 --> 09:29.410
I-I didn't get this job--

09:29.440 --> 09:31.560
I'd rather set the record straight on something else,

09:31.590 --> 09:34.220
like tharumor floating around about the governor's affair.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.930
We got a tip,camped out at the hotel gerard.

09:37.950 --> 09:40.060
Did you try the restaurant?
Four stars.I hear it's fantastic.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.040
I've got photographs.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.140
That's governor kern arriving at 11:00 A.M through the back door.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.610
That's 20 minutes later-- senator mccallister-- through the same door.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.050
They both checked in under aliases.

09:55.070 --> 09:56.690
That's irrelevant.
They're both public figures.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.360
That doesn't seem irrelevant to me.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.200
It seems like they didn't want anyone to know they were meeting.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.040
You know,there is an election going on.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.600
I'm sure you could get a bigger story than this.

10:05.630 --> 10:08.320
well,this is a big story.

10:08.340 --> 10:11.870
It's not as big as the libel suit you'd be facing if you run with it.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.540
That's interesting.

10:13.570 --> 10:17.710
So far you've given me irrelevant,and now you've given me libel,

10:17.750 --> 10:19.900
but not once have you denied it.

10:19.930 --> 10:21.170
look,I'm denying it.

10:21.250 --> 10:25.040
I'm gonna give you 24 hours to tell me what happened at that meeting,

10:25.090 --> 10:27.260
and then I'm running the story.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.010
Fine.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.630
all right,so call I.C.U.
And make sure they've got a bed ready.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.920
Excuse me,trish.
I'm--I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.740
Dr. Evans.
Hi.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.590
I'll meet you in post-op.

10:49.070 --> 10:51.110
Kitty.
What's going on?

10:51.140 --> 10:53.670
Well,I was just wondering if it would be possible for me

10:53.710 --> 10:56.180
to ask you a couple of questions before dinner.

10:56.230 --> 10:58.600
Well,I've got about three minutes,so shoot.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.690
Okay,okay.Well,um,

11:00.720 --> 11:03.270
this--this might sound silly,but,um,

11:03.310 --> 11:08.710
I've always been under the assumption that our birth mother would be,um...

11:08.740 --> 11:12.620
well,you know,some-- some kind of messed up kid.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.090
But--but you,see,you could do this.

11:15.110 --> 11:17.590
I mean,even if you work nonstop,you could hire a nanny.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.750
I don't want a nanny.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.120
I-I just keeping thinking about what you said this morning,

11:22.140 --> 11:24.770
how your career is your baby,and

11:24.790 --> 11:27.900
I used to say the same thing,and then I changed my mind.So

11:27.940 --> 11:30.440
I just wanted to make sure that you've,

11:30.470 --> 11:31.770
you know,thought this through.

11:31.810 --> 11:34.180
Kitty,I'm a surgeon.
I think everything through.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.030
For now,but what about when you finish your residency?

11:36.050 --> 11:37.760
You know what happens to egg quality.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.240
You know,I really don't need a reproductive health lecture.

11:40.270 --> 11:42.380
Oh,no.I'm--no.
I'm--I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.970
All I'm saying is that things change.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.280
I mean,what--what's-- what's going to happen

11:47.310 --> 11:49.750
when you see the heartbeat or you see the little toes or--

11:49.780 --> 11:51.300
I've seen the toes.

11:51.330 --> 11:53.970
Okay,well,what about when your friends all start having babies,

11:54.010 --> 11:57.350
and all they talk about are strollers and--and onesies and--and "baby mozart"?

11:57.370 --> 11:59.650
Okay,stop,stop.

11:59.670 --> 12:02.830
Look,they make us sit down for a reason--

12:02.870 --> 12:05.040
so we can see if this works for both of us.

12:05.060 --> 12:07.740
- Right.
- Obviously,it doesn'T.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.410
No,no,no,no,no.
That--that is not what I'm saying at all.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.210
I just want to be sure that you're sure.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.130
Kitty,I deal with enough neuroses with my patients.
I'm sorry.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.760
Well,w-wait.
What about dinner?

12:18.790 --> 12:21.750
I've been on call for 36 hours.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.030
Let's not waste each other's time.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.490
can we talk?

12:32.530 --> 12:34.370
Talk to stu.
I don't weigh in by the hour.

12:34.400 --> 12:39.350
That reporter has photographs of you and the governor sneaking into hotel gerard.

12:39.370 --> 12:41.260
Kevin...

12:41.280 --> 12:45.820
I spent $40 million last year trying to get my face in front of the american people.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.710
I'd like to think that I can'tsneak in anywhere.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.740
Are you having an affair?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.710
Kitty's my sister.
I think I have a right to ask.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.450
You know,this morng it was the anti-gay marriage initiative,now it's your sister.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.640
This job isn't about your personaissues.

12:58.660 --> 13:02.140
It's about you supporting and protecting my professional agenda.

13:02.170 --> 13:03.820
I can't do that if I don't have the facts.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.460
The facts are,I met with the governor to discuss a sensitive political issue.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.760
Beyond that,it is confidential.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.340
Oh,okay.And the meeting you ran off to this morning?Is that confidential,too?

13:13.370 --> 13:15.040
That meeting was with our birth mother,

13:15.070 --> 13:17.260
who,by the way,happens to be amazing.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.930
But if she picks up the paper tomorrow

13:18.960 --> 13:22.000
and reads a slanderous story about me and another government official,

13:22.030 --> 13:23.370
she could change her mind.

13:23.390 --> 13:26.060
So if you're really concerned with your sister,not to mention your job,

13:26.090 --> 13:29.430
you'll suck it up and you'll figure out a way to fix it!

13:31.100 --> 13:34.910
And you better figure out a way to trust me,or this isn't gonna work out.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.100
If you don't mind...

13:50.470 --> 13:52.510
did you guys read the focus group report?

13:52.530 --> 13:54.620
The web applications aren't user-friendly enough.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.840
No way.
A chimp could navigate that program.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.700
But we didn't test it on a chimp.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.220
Listen,people just want to enter a product and find out the greenest way to get it.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.740
What did they think of our carbon footprint graph?

14:03.770 --> 14:05.110
The colors are confusing.

14:05.140 --> 14:08.650
If the asparagus is flown in from argentina,it's red,

14:08.670 --> 14:10.980
but if it's trucked in from mexico,it's orange.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.240
Because it's all about mileage--

14:12.280 --> 14:14.870
more mileage,more gas,more damage to the environment.I don't--

14:14.900 --> 14:16.150
I don't understand why that's difficult.

14:16.170 --> 14:19.320
Because people think it is.
Page 26.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.940
Oh,nice,E.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.870
Draw her a rocket ship.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.370
Look,I don't need to see his rocket ship.

14:29.810 --> 14:32.550
whoa.Hey.
What's with this magic stuff?

14:32.570 --> 14:35.480
It's for my brother's anniversary party at magic manor.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.250
Listen,guys,could we please focus?

14:39.270 --> 14:40.810
I don't know.
We may have lost him.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.900
You're looking athe magic club president right there.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.810
I don't care if he's david blaine.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.970
And the music?
I married a failed musician.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.030
I'd really prefer not to be working with one.

14:49.050 --> 14:52.090
- This is our process.
- Well,it's not mine,okay?

14:52.130 --> 14:54.450
At my house,no magic tricks,no music,

14:54.470 --> 14:56.890
no frickin' rocket ships or crazy robots.

14:56.910 --> 14:59.430
I have two kids,a mortgage.
I don't have time for this.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.320
HellO.
All right,I'm panicked.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.400
The parlor magician canceled on the day of the party.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.670
- What's a parlor magician?
- Oh,I know.

15:06.690 --> 15:09.550
It's the cool guy from victorian times who walked around the parlor doing tricks.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.780
So much for the magic of tommy and julia.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.710
What's a magic party without a magician?

15:13.730 --> 15:16.360
It's a disaster,that's what it is.

15:16.370 --> 15:20.790
I think I might have a substitute for you.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.530
You do?
Sarah,how is that even possible?

15:23.550 --> 15:25.920
It's magic.
He'll be there at 6:00.

15:25.940 --> 15:29.850
This is just so crazy.
Ryan has five half siblings.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.470
He doesn't even know who they are.

15:31.490 --> 15:33.630
That's not how life's supposed to go.

15:33.660 --> 15:37.030
You and I,we're the parents,and before you know it,we'll be dead and gone.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.740
- Oh,now that's cheerful.
- You know what I mean.

15:39.770 --> 15:42.720
Your--your siblings are with you for the long haul.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.070
Well,I can't argue with you there.

15:45.090 --> 15:48.870
My brother saul is my best friend,and my kids have always had each other.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.280
They fight,but they've always had each other.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.010
I actually wish I could meet 'em.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.810
It's like I-I need a crystal ball or something.

15:58.550 --> 16:01.090
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

16:01.110 --> 16:03.310
Why don't you come to the party tonight?

16:03.350 --> 16:07.300
You could see for yourself.
Maybe it would help you make a decision.

16:07.310 --> 16:08.990
It would.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.230
But then what if I decide not to pursue it?

16:11.250 --> 16:12.480
Your whole family would know.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.270
Well,no one knows you except kitty,and she's not even gonna be there.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.520
So we just tell 'em I'm some handsome stranger you picked up?

16:19.540 --> 16:21.040
Yeah.
Bob.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.870
Bob?No,I don't want to be bob.

16:22.890 --> 16:23.930
How about mick jagger?

16:23.950 --> 16:26.780
Well,I don't think they'd believe that.
How about bob jagger?

16:26.810 --> 16:28.700
And we--we met,wait,uh,where did we meet?

16:28.730 --> 16:30.590
A widow's mixer.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.390
first you want to be a rock 'n' roll star,and then you're trolling for widows?

16:33.410 --> 16:36.120
How about dylan jagger?

16:36.150 --> 16:38.280
You are so stuck in the '60s.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.810
come in.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.170
just use your key.

16:44.190 --> 16:46.230
I thought you wanted me to ring the bell.

16:47.950 --> 16:49.690
Seriously?

16:49.720 --> 16:51.260
I didn't mean never use your key.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.170
Well,that's kind of a xed signal,don't you think?

16:53.190 --> 16:55.400
Oh,this is about this morning,isn't it?

16:55.420 --> 16:56.910
Listen,I just-- I wasn't expecting--

16:56.940 --> 16:57.770
you know what?Please don't explain.

16:57.790 --> 16:59.660
No,I-I didn't want to say it just because you said it.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.130
- Rebecca！
- all I'm saying is,

17:01.150 --> 17:04.010
you got to find your moment.
I want to find minE.

17:04.030 --> 17:05.760
Can we just drop this?

17:05.780 --> 17:08.310
Let's just go to the party,all right?
Everything's fine.

17:08.990 --> 17:12.010
Great.Exactly what I'm in the mood for-- an anniversary party.Awesome.

17:16.290 --> 17:19.099
Oh,hey.I-I thought we were meeting at the restaurant.

17:19.130 --> 17:22.119
Oh,uh,no.
Um...

17:22.140 --> 17:24.609
- trish canceled dinner.
- Oh.

17:24.630 --> 17:25.560
Did something come up at the hospital?

17:25.589 --> 17:31.460
No,actually,it's,uh,it's much worse than that.She,um...

17:31.480 --> 17:34.240
she changed her mind about the adoption.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.490
What are you talking about?

17:36.520 --> 17:40.500
Look,I know how much you loved her,but I had a very weird feeling,

17:40.530 --> 17:43.180
so I went to the hospital,I stopped by to see her.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.450
You--you stopped by?

17:45.480 --> 17:48.160
I,uh,I wanted to talk to her.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.630
And the minute I brought up some issues,she-- she pulled out on the spot.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.870
But things were perfect.
They wermore than perfect.

17:53.890 --> 17:56.770
- Look,I know that's what you thought！
- no,that's what trish said.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.390
And now the whole adoption is off?
What on earth did you say to her?

18:00.420 --> 18:02.820
I just told her that I was a career woman myself,

18:02.860 --> 18:05.970
and that I didn't want to have a baby,and now I did.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.440
I just wanted to make sure that she considered

18:08.460 --> 18:10.990
what it would feel like to give up a baby at her age.

18:11.030 --> 18:13.230
- You mentioned her age?
- This is not my fault.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.170
She was gonna chan her mind no matter what,

18:15.180 --> 18:16.900
or she never would've reacted that way.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.060
I don't get it.

18:19.510 --> 18:22.260
- Do you even want this?
- Of course I want this.

18:22.290 --> 18:24.380
Then how,after everything we've been through,

18:24.410 --> 18:27.870
when we finally get chosen by a woman who is smart and talented

18:27.890 --> 18:29.800
and more than we ever could've hoped for in a birth mother,

18:29.820 --> 18:34.600
- do you choose to go and confront her on her decision?
- Because we were about to get our hearts broken.

18:34.630 --> 18:37.880
Well,if you're not ready to have your heart broken,you're not ready to be a parent.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.150
- You don't have to walk away.
- Yeah,I do.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.640
- TommY.
- Hey,guys.

18:56.670 --> 18:58.220
Happy anniversary.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.250
Yeah.
Julia went all-out.

19:00.270 --> 19:01.980
I guess she still loves me,huh?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.830
Must be nice.

19:03.850 --> 19:05.920
I'm gonna go get a drink.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.880
- What's--
- don't ask.

19:07.890 --> 19:09.690
- Hi,boys.
- Hey,mom.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.420
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.760
- Sweetheart,hi.
- Hi,mom.

19:13.510 --> 19:17.870
Um,boys,I would like you to meet my friend elton.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.940
- Elton?
- Uh,it's a family name.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.780
- A lot of people named elton.
- No,I didn't mean it like-- sorrY.

19:22.810 --> 19:24.630
- I'm--I'm tommy.
- Hi.Congratulations.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.870
- I hear it's your anniversary.
- Thank you.

19:25.890 --> 19:28.150
Tommy runs the family business.

19:28.180 --> 19:29.590
He's the one that put the winery in,

19:29.620 --> 19:33.560
and he has the most beautiful little daughter--elizabeth-- my granddaughter.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.490
And this is my son justin.

19:39.490 --> 19:41.480
Well,that about sums it up.

19:41.490 --> 19:42.990
Pick a card.

19:43.010 --> 19:44.200
- That's the one you want?
- Yes.

19:44.240 --> 19:44.930
- You're sure?
- YeS.

19:44.970 --> 19:45.960
- Positive?
- Positive.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.530
Okay.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.770
Was that your card?

19:49.790 --> 19:52.260
- no way.
- How'd you do that?That's great.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.040
- Thank you.
- He's great,julia.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.230
I know.
Sarah found him.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.740
- I have no idea how.
- You know,I have my sources.

19:57.770 --> 20:01.050
Okay,miss clara the fortune-teller...Knew everything about .

20:01.090 --> 20:03.160
She knew my first pet's name started with a "w"--wendell.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.940
It was this miniature bijon my parents used to have--

20:04.960 --> 20:06.340
she knew that I had trouble making decisions,

20:06.350 --> 20:10.310
which is not gonna affect us and our business,um...

20:12.790 --> 20:15.080
- Hi,I'm kyle.
- I'm julia.Hi.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.600
Hi,holly.
Holly,nice to meet you.

20:16.630 --> 20:18.190
Uh,sarah's new business partner.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.100
- Yeah,I'm consulting for！
- consulting?

20:20.130 --> 20:21.910
You're,like,one of the founders.So is he.

20:21.940 --> 20:25.120
We're,uh,we're starting an internet company.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.680
Oh,I-I didn't realize that you were in business with a magician.

20:29.710 --> 20:30.770
Give it a break,holly.

20:30.790 --> 20:33.090
Sarah,so who's your mom new guy?

20:33.110 --> 20:34.900
- Mom has a guy?
- You don't know?

20:34.930 --> 20:36.680
She brought a guy.

20:37.650 --> 20:39.200
Excuse me.

20:39.790 --> 20:43.590
Thank you.So,uh,how do you two know each other?

20:43.600 --> 20:44.910
- it's funny.
- No,it is.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.760
- It's-- it's really a funny story.
- It's very--it's very funny.

20:46.790 --> 20:48.110
- Hey,guys.
- hey.

20:48.130 --> 20:49.570
Isn't this great?
I feel like a kid again.

20:49.590 --> 20:51.770
This is my beautiful daughter sarah.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.700
- Elton.
- Hi.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.650
Oh,elton.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.520
Mom was just gonna tell us how they met.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.740
Oh,god.
I love the "how we met" stories.Go on.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.610
We were at a restaurant a--not together.

21:01.620 --> 21:06.910
We weren't together,were we?
And this man began to choke.

21:08.880 --> 21:13.260
and elton-- he just went over there and gave him the heimlich maneuver,just like that.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.710
Nora called the paramedics.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.610
And then we started talking,and we have just so much in common.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.020
- hilarious.
- Wow,M.

21:20.050 --> 21:23.620
Some guy almost dies,and you go score a date.Good girl.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.300
It's not a date,per se.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.060
Yeah,and don't worry.
He w--he was fine...

21:27.070 --> 21:28.910
Once he spit out the,uh,the--

21:28.920 --> 21:30.080
- the fish bone.
- Ham gristle.

21:30.110 --> 21:32.400
- ham gristle?
- Was it a fish bone?

21:32.420 --> 21:33.510
- It was a fish bone.
- Yeah.

21:33.550 --> 21:36.590
oh,it was a fish bone.
I didn't even know what it was.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.830
Okay,so why don't you kids go have some fun?

21:41.850 --> 21:44.610
We're going to go d enjoy the magic and all that.

21:44.630 --> 21:46.630
- Nice meeting you.
- You,too,elton.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.720
What was that?

21:49.740 --> 21:52.000
I guess,uh,mom has a new boyfriend?

21:52.020 --> 21:54.380
Elton?
Really?

21:56.390 --> 21:58.730
ah.
I see it.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.200
Look toward the bottom of the cup.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.150
See how the leaves form the shape of a heart?

22:04.180 --> 22:06.310
Sorta,if I squint.

22:06.340 --> 22:09.580
- What does that mean?
- It means the's a great love in store.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.510
Someone is out there waiting for you.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.790
Yeah,that would be my boyfriend.

22:13.820 --> 22:16.180
He's out there waiting for me to say "I love you."

22:16.200 --> 22:20.010
Actually,the placement indicates the distant future.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.070
It could take years to meet this person.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.150
Years?

22:24.170 --> 22:27.720
What about now?Um,what are you saying,that justin's love isn't great?

22:27.740 --> 22:29.170
I can only interpret what's here.

22:29.210 --> 22:29.970
You don't even know him.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.020
I mean,you're just reading some--some leftover dregs from a stupid teacup.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.730
It's not stupid,unless your spirit is closed.

22:35.740 --> 22:36.840
My spirit is not closed.

22:36.860 --> 22:38.250
I mean,who said that my spirit is closed?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.660
Your spirit is closed.

22:39.690 --> 22:43.190
Look,I know you think you're in love,but I promise,

22:43.220 --> 22:45.890
another few years,a great love will come along...

22:45.910 --> 22:48.630
you're not even going to remember this guy.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.100
Oh,that's wonderful,ethan.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.240
great.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.920
Oh,kevin,you're here.

22:54.950 --> 22:56.920
You just missed some fantastic magic.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.580
Not a fan,remember?

22:58.610 --> 23:01.660
I actually need your advice,okay?
You worked for your brother-in-law.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.470
What did you do when dad did things you didn't like?

23:04.500 --> 23:06.640
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:06.670 --> 23:09.660
Okay,you--you didn't tell mom about holly for one thing.

23:09.690 --> 23:12.570
Well,I didn't tell your mother about holly because I thought I was protecting her.

23:12.590 --> 23:16.630
My job is to protect robert,and I'm not saying he's dad,but

23:16.660 --> 23:22.380
he's a-- he's asking me to cover for him without telling me what it is I'm covering.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.960
All he says is I-- I have to trust him.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.560
Do you?

23:27.320 --> 23:29.040
I don't know.

23:29.070 --> 23:31.000
We all know you're the family cynic.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.080
I mean,certainly,that's why you hate magic.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.990
You just are always looking for the angle.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.430
You can't give in to the illusion.

23:36.450 --> 23:37.890
But robert is not an illusion.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.370
That's what you're gonna have to decide for yourself--

23:40.400 --> 23:43.380
if he's putting one over on you or if robert is the real thing.

23:43.410 --> 23:48.360
And by the way,kevin,if you can't trust him,don't work for him.

23:50.330 --> 23:51.320
make it here,you know?

23:51.350 --> 23:52.380
Excuse me.
Sorry.

23:52.410 --> 23:53.400
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you?

23:53.420 --> 23:55.080
Hey,where you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

23:57.530 --> 23:58.900
I love you.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.470
You do?

24:02.100 --> 24:04.450
Yeah.
God,that felt good.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.710
Wow.
Yeah.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.690
- Damn right,that feels good.
- yeah,I know.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.700
I feel like there's weight off my shoulders.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.220
That woman had no idea what she was talking about.

24:14.190 --> 24:15.870
What woman?

24:15.890 --> 24:18.080
Um,nothing.
Just this fortune-teller.

24:18.130 --> 24:20.510
She said that you're not my great love.
Whatever.

24:20.530 --> 24:25.140
Wait,that--that's why you said it,because some fortuneeller told youe were doomed?

24:25.170 --> 24:26.880
So this is your moment?

24:26.900 --> 24:28.860
Rebecca,this seems like a lame protest to me.

24:28.890 --> 24:30.540
Justin,why are you making such a big deal out of this?

24:30.560 --> 24:32.210
Well,I'm--I'm sorry.Where I come from,

24:32.230 --> 24:33.990
saying I love you actually comes from the people saying it.

24:34.020 --> 24:36.470
Okay,well,sorry.I-I can't seem to say anything right.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.160
Why don't you just write me a script next time?

24:38.180 --> 24:40.380
You know what?I'm gonna give you these back,rebecca.

24:40.410 --> 24:43.120
And when you figure it out,you let me know,all right?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.810
So...
elton?

24:46.850 --> 24:49.600
Yes,elton.Why are you guys so hung up on his name?

24:49.630 --> 24:51.850
Have you guys done the dance with no pants?

24:51.870 --> 24:53.390
- Sarah.
- What?Come on.

24:53.410 --> 24:56.670
One of us should be having sex,and sadly,it's not me.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.340
Well,it's not me,either.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.480
Just because I brought a friend to the party does not mean we're sleeping together.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.840
I mean,you brought two men with you.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.950
I'm not accusing you of having a menage trois.

25:04.980 --> 25:05.760
Mom!

25:05.790 --> 25:06.920
Well,you're the one who brought up sex.

25:06.950 --> 25:08.710
Well,I regret it,

25:08.730 --> 25:11.740
almost as much as I regret bringing ethan and kyle.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.020
Holly practically did a cartwheel when she heard we were in business together.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.150
Holly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.700
I don't know,mom.
Maybe she's right.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.200
I mean,really,a start-up in this financial climate?

25:21.210 --> 25:23.040
Bear stearns can't even keep afloat,

25:23.070 --> 25:26.840
and I'm in business with a magician who wants to show me his rocket ship.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.390
- Oh,no.
- You think I made a mistake.

25:31.420 --> 25:33.920
- Oh,my god.
- Oh,god.It's bad.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.450
I really screwed up.

25:35.470 --> 25:36.930
Oh,hi.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.640
Kitty,what are you doing here?

25:38.660 --> 25:40.540
I-I thought you were meeting with your birth mother.

25:40.570 --> 25:41.510
Yeah.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.920
Well,I--it-- uh,it's a long story.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.570
Well,good.
Tell sarah about it.

25:48.770 --> 25:50.150
what the hell is up with mom?

25:50.180 --> 25:52.420
I don't know.
She's been acting weird all night.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.080
She brought this guy-- elton.

25:55.110 --> 25:57.100
- Elton?
- Exactly.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.830
Dude,what's with the briefcase?

25:58.850 --> 26:00.270
Robert won't give you the night off?

26:00.300 --> 26:01.300
Kevin has a new job.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.350
Yeah,he's a lawyer turned republican.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.620
I'm still a democrat,dumb-ass.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.960
Why don't you be nice,justin?
You' embarrass your mother's date.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.710
- Oh,it's not really a da.
- Elton,there you are.

26:09.730 --> 26:13.510
You know,it's such a lovely evening out.
Why don't we take a walk?

26:13.530 --> 26:14.970
That sounds like a date to me.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.280
I was really enjoying talking to your family.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.910
Oh!
Kitty.

26:20.940 --> 26:21.940
George?

26:21.970 --> 26:23.930
What-- what are you doing here?

26:23.950 --> 26:25.680
This is elton.
That's mom's date.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.790
Don't be rude.
Do you want a drink?

26:27.810 --> 26:30.580
Oh.
You're-- you're dating ryan's dad?

26:30.610 --> 26:33.830
- No,she's dating elton richards.
- I'm not dating him.

26:33.850 --> 26:34.410
What?

26:34.440 --> 26:35.700
I'm--I'm sorry.
Excuse me.No,no,no.

26:35.730 --> 26:38.070
- This is,uh,george lafferty.
- what?

26:38.090 --> 26:40.530
Ryan's george lafferty?

26:40.550 --> 26:43.370
- mom.
- Mom,I knew you were hiding something.

26:43.390 --> 26:45.200
Mom!

26:45.220 --> 26:47.770
All right,fine.

26:47.790 --> 26:50.320
George,this is my family.

26:50.350 --> 26:53.310
Family,this is...
george lafferty.

26:58.740 --> 27:00.180
Hi.

27:00.930 --> 27:01.850
Oh,my god.

27:02.890 --> 27:04.460
unbelievable.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.290
Since when are you friends with george lafferty?

27:06.310 --> 27:08.210
- He kicked us out of his house.
- You went to his house?

27:08.590 --> 27:11.250
- Look,this is really all my fault.
- No,it is not.

27:11.270 --> 27:14.000
I invited you here to meet ryan's half siblings.

27:14.020 --> 27:17.810
I'm soy we deceived u,but george needs to figure this out.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.510
I thought meeting you might help.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.140
So what is this,like,a big audition to see if we're up to sibling snuff,mom?

27:22.160 --> 27:24.160
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

27:24.180 --> 27:25.060
- Oh,hey,julia.
- Yes,fine.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.590
- It's a lovely party.
- I thought I heard yelling.

27:26.620 --> 27:27.930
oh,in our family?
No.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.830
We're just all catching up with george.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.410
You mean elton.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.080
How about some cupcakes?

27:37.530 --> 27:38.770
can you believe our mom?

27:38.800 --> 27:41.720
Nothing our mom does shocks me anymore.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.740
W-why are you so out of breath?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.610
- I've been looking for you.
- Well,where's scotty?

27:45.630 --> 27:48.400
He couldn't get any time off work.
Where's--where's robert?

27:48.440 --> 27:52.020
Robert's at home being furious.
Really?How furious?

27:52.030 --> 27:54.020
I went to see our birth mother.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.690
Oh,of course.
Oh,good.Good,good,good.

27:55.710 --> 27:57.450
Oh,no.
No,no.No,kevin.
Not good.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.420
Bad.
Very bad.

27:59.450 --> 28:01.270
N-- she changed her mind about the adoption.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.180
She's not gonna go through with it,not with us anyway.

28:04.210 --> 28:05.870
Well,did she hear something about robert?

28:05.900 --> 28:08.340
No.
No,she--she loved robert.

28:08.360 --> 28:09.320
It was--it was me.

28:09.340 --> 28:10.890
I showed up with all of these questions

28:10.920 --> 28:13.480
because I wanted proof that she wasn't gonna change her mind.

28:13.510 --> 28:14.880
Well,what's wrong with wanting proof?

28:14.930 --> 28:18.450
Well,what's wrong with it is that she couldn't give it to me,obviously.

28:18.470 --> 28:20.160
And she shoun't have to.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.810
But it h--it has nothing to do with robert?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.720
Oh,would you please stop trying to make this about robert?

28:25.740 --> 28:27.170
- This is about me.
- Right.

28:27.190 --> 28:32.560
Kevin,I'm serious.
I think I made a very big mistake.I-I...

28:32.590 --> 28:34.830
I couldn't trust her,and...

28:34.840 --> 28:37.280
and now we don't have a baby.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.460
So fix it.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.120
looks like someone is on the horizon...

28:44.140 --> 28:48.130
someone who will bring great upheaval into your life.

28:48.140 --> 28:50.670
No,no,no.I thought so,too.
But that's wrong.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.840
- No,this reading's pretty clear.
- Well,the reading is wrong.

28:52.860 --> 28:57.730
George is actually a very nice guy just caught in a really difficult situation.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.840
I can identify with that.

28:59.860 --> 29:04.330
Well,the way these cards are spread,this person represents a threat.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.990
Maybe it's talking about his son ryan.

29:07.010 --> 29:09.980
And I'm telling you right now,I am done being scared.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.440
Siblings should meet each other.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.810
I think we're finally gonna get the chance to meet him,

29:14.840 --> 29:17.280
and I'm actually happy about that.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.970
- That's good.
- Yeah.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.400
That's great.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.700
What else do they say?

29:22.730 --> 29:27.020
Ladies and gentlemen,I know many of you don't believe in magic.

29:27.050 --> 29:29.360
Instead,you search for an explanation.

29:29.390 --> 29:32.580
There must be something I'm not telling you,something I'm hiding.

29:32.610 --> 29:33.500
You're right.

29:33.520 --> 29:38.810
Most of the time,magic is about sleight of hand,the principle of misdirection.

29:38.830 --> 29:40.950
I make you look one way...

29:40.980 --> 29:43.140
so you forget to look the other.

29:52.170 --> 29:53.960
hi.

29:53.980 --> 29:56.950
Have you seen a young woman,light brown hair,tall?

29:56.970 --> 29:59.070
I seem to have lost my daughter.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.590
No,but I'll--I'll keep an eye out.

30:00.620 --> 30:01.860
- Uh...okay.
- What--what's her ne?

30:01.890 --> 30:03.790
Rebecc thanks.

30:03.800 --> 30:09.140
Uh,wait,are...are you,uh,are you holly?

30:09.160 --> 30:10.330
Yeah.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.260
I'm,uh,I'm george lafferty.

30:13.970 --> 30:16.320
Oh,my god.

30:16.330 --> 30:18.670
You're ryan's dad.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.720
I guess you've heard about me,too.

30:21.740 --> 30:26.090
I hope you don't mind,but nora told me about what happened with your daughter.

30:26.810 --> 30:29.090
No,I don't mind.

30:31.230 --> 30:37.260
It's just thatuh,she might not be the most reliable narrator.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.260
Well,it's probably pretty complicated between you two.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.250
No,actually,it's quite simple.

30:43.270 --> 30:46.570
But I do know what it's like to be in your position,

30:46.600 --> 30:50.750
so if there's ever anything that I can do...

30:51.680 --> 30:53.420
uh,holly.

30:55.260 --> 30:57.940
I do have a few questions.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.830
Sure.

30:59.860 --> 31:04.160
watch closely,because with julia's help,

31:04.190 --> 31:07.790
you're about to see something so amazing,so improbable,

31:07.820 --> 31:10.350
it's hard to chalk it up to any fact or principle.

31:10.380 --> 31:12.830
Man has always dreamed of conquering gravity.

31:12.850 --> 31:17.410
In the 1800s,european audiences saw,for the first time,people rise unassisted...

31:18.630 --> 31:21.370
so...you called me down here.

31:21.390 --> 31:23.410
What do you got?

31:26.190 --> 31:28.400
There's an exit out that way.

31:29.780 --> 31:32.450
just maybe it's magic.

31:32.470 --> 31:39.200
With one snap of my fingers,the lovely julia will fall into a deep,deep sleep.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.370
- nora.
- Oh,george.Sorry.

32:09.390 --> 32:10.970
I-I got sucked into watching the show.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.990
It's okay.
I-I have to go.

32:13.020 --> 32:14.610
Go?
What do you mean?

32:14.630 --> 32:16.980
You know,your family's lovely and very seductive--

32:17.010 --> 32:19.260
seductive?All right,which one of 'em hit on you?

32:19.280 --> 32:21.360
It's--it's not like that.

32:21.390 --> 32:22.550
I was right the first time.

32:22.580 --> 32:25.620
This was a mistake.
It--it won't be good for ryan orny of us.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.060
I--I'd rather leave it alone.

32:27.090 --> 32:28.270
I don't understand.

32:28.300 --> 32:32.580
Our families are what they are.
Let's not destroy anything.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.050
Good-bye,nora.

32:55.830 --> 32:58.070
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.250
How was the party?

32:59.270 --> 33:01.940
Oh,god.
Never a-- never a dull moment.

33:01.970 --> 33:05.960
I'll tell you all about that later.
Robert...

33:06.760 --> 33:10.140
I am really,really sorry.

33:10.170 --> 33:13.090
I never should've gone to trish without telling you.

33:13.110 --> 33:16.620
I don't know why,but I just l my anxiety get the best of me.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.650
And I-I-I knew how you felt about her,

33:18.670 --> 33:21.180
and I didn't want you to think that I was crazy and--

33:21.210 --> 33:23.790
I-I love you when you're crazy.

33:23.820 --> 33:26.780
But what I don't love is when you go off,

33:26.810 --> 33:30.320
you know,without me and don't tell me about it.You know,

33:30.340 --> 33:33.040
we're gonna be parents,so we need to be...

33:33.060 --> 33:35.070
- trusting each other.
- I do trust you.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.920
It's just-- it's everybody else in the world that I don't trust.

33:38.940 --> 33:41.330
And I just didn't know if I could do it again.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.300
I mean,we've already lost a baby,and I--

33:43.320 --> 33:44.670
oh,is that what this is all about?

33:44.710 --> 33:46.100
Oh,it's--it's everything,you know?

33:46.130 --> 33:48.770
It's--it's all the fertility treatments that didn't work

33:48.790 --> 33:51.520
and all the pregnancy tests that came back negative.

33:51.560 --> 33:55.980
And I just-- I have had my heart broken...

33:56.000 --> 33:58.730
many times.

34:01.070 --> 34:03.430
But I am ready to be a parent.

34:03.450 --> 34:06.090
- I know.
- And I'm gonna fix it.

34:06.110 --> 34:10.300
I'm gonna make this right with trish.
I prise.I'M...

34:10.320 --> 34:12.230
I'm gonna fix it.

34:17.260 --> 34:18.710
- there she is.
- Good morning.

34:18.730 --> 34:20.389
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

34:20.409 --> 34:22.409
- What time is it?
- It's on time.

34:22.429 --> 34:24.440
You laid down the law,remember?

34:24.449 --> 34:26.060
Have you guys been to bed?

34:26.080 --> 34:28.330
Are you kidding?
I worked a night at the magic manor.

34:28.350 --> 34:29.870
That's like playing carnegie hall.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.679
Check this out?
See that?

34:31.699 --> 34:34.960
New web application-- simplified,streamlined,sexy.

34:34.980 --> 34:36.909
And a new carbon footprint graph.

34:36.929 --> 34:38.290
You did this last night?

34:38.320 --> 34:41.270
We may act like we're stupid.
We're not.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.460
You don't act stupid.
You act 20.

34:43.489 --> 34:46.170
- We're older than that.
- I know.Sorry.

34:46.199 --> 34:49.190
Listen,working with you guys,it's a little bit of an adjustment.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.780
I have a lot at stake.

34:50.810 --> 34:51.920
Yeah?
Well,so do we.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.090
You know,you shouldee our credit card bills.

34:53.110 --> 34:54.360
We're not gonna fail.

34:54.389 --> 34:57.610
Miss clara last night told me we're gonna make boatloads of money.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.590
you just gotta trust the process.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.320
Maybe you're right.

35:03.350 --> 35:05.020
Ethan,draw me a rocket ship.

35:05.050 --> 35:06.560
Yes,ma'am.

35:13.140 --> 35:14.520
you seen the paper today?

35:14.540 --> 35:17.890
No,I-I was just-- "senator robert mccallister had a private meeting "

35:17.920 --> 35:20.110
with fellow republican governor eve kern

35:20.150 --> 35:21.910
"urging her to release a strong statement "

35:21.940 --> 35:25.730
against the limited marriage act in time for the general election."

35:25.760 --> 35:26.800
Any word of an affair?

35:26.830 --> 35:32.630
Nope,just a follow-up from the governor refirming all californians' rights to marry.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.720
Stu said make it go away.
I...

35:34.750 --> 35:35.560
made it go away.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.650
While forwarding your own political agenda.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.270
You know,I'm gonna take about five minutes before I fire you.

35:40.290 --> 35:42.670
Look,I was just-- this is grounds for immediate termination.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.410
Kevin,when you're in a foxhole with someone,

35:44.440 --> 35:46.500
you need to know the man who's got your back,

35:46.530 --> 35:48.160
and right now,I don't know who you are.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.920
I had to deal with that reporter on the fly.

35:49.950 --> 35:53.020
That statement I had for proposition 8 was in my briefcase.

35:53.050 --> 35:55.100
It was at my disposal.
I used it.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.580
Do I still think you should've released it of your own accord?

35:57.610 --> 36:00.240
Absolutely.
But I was not out to undermine you.

36:00.270 --> 36:02.970
If you had trusted me with the actual information,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.260
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.790
Okay.
The governor's having an affair.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.410
And it's messy,and there are children involved,

36:13.450 --> 36:16.060
and she wanted to meet with me to get my advice.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.980
And I told her she's gotta come clean,but I don't know where this is gonna end.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.880
Kevin,you have my trust,

36:22.910 --> 36:26.730
but there are gonna be times when I'm not gonna be able to tell you everything.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.230
Fair enough.

36:30.970 --> 36:32.460
Here.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.610
Wait.
This isn't spencer's article.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.680
No,no.
That's an op-ed piece by henry myers.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.890
That guy's been pissing on me since the day I got elected.

36:41.910 --> 36:44.510
Now all of a sudden,I'm a hero.

36:44.530 --> 36:46.970
Good job.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.290
Thank you,senator.

36:52.350 --> 36:55.300
Seductive?
Our family is seductive?

36:55.320 --> 36:57.450
No.
This came right from holly.

36:57.470 --> 36:59.540
Oh,you don't know that,nora.

36:59.570 --> 37:01.130
Maybe george decided on his own.

37:01.150 --> 37:03.420
No,no,no,she had it written all over her face.

37:03.460 --> 37:05.320
This woman lives to get at me.

37:05.350 --> 37:08.260
First she pushes me to find george and tell him the truth.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.150
And then the minute he starts connecting with our family,

37:10.180 --> 37:11.410
she sends him running for the hills.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.940
Well,isn't that what you wanted?

37:12.960 --> 37:14.890
Poof,remember?

37:14.920 --> 37:17.380
Holly doesn't have anything on you now.

37:17.410 --> 37:19.210
It's all over.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.950
Yeah.

37:20.980 --> 37:23.840
I can't help feeling there's something looming on the horizon.

37:23.870 --> 37:25.950
Oh,it's a bit overdramatic,wouldn't you say?

37:25.980 --> 37:28.020
Even the fortune-teller said that.

37:28.050 --> 37:29.610
Now who's buying into magic?

37:29.640 --> 37:33.530
She said someone would come into our lives that would cause great upheaval.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.430
And she said that I would meet a nice woman and I would settle down.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.090
All right.

37:42.110 --> 37:43.640
You're right.
What am I worried about?

37:43.660 --> 37:46.440
This is exactly what I wanted,and it's the best thing.

37:46.470 --> 37:48.830
It's the very,very best thing.

37:49.590 --> 37:51.880
It's the best thing.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.120
Just tell her to hold on one second 'cause I'm here.

37:54.140 --> 37:56.050
I'm right outside.
I was--oh!

37:56.640 --> 37:59.020
Trish.
Kitty,you can't keep showing up.

37:59.050 --> 38:03.130
I know.You're on your way to the airport,but I-I owe you an apology.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.780
I...

38:04.810 --> 38:08.230
I just got scared because you remind me so much of me,

38:08.260 --> 38:10.310
and I know how much I nt this baby.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.290
And I know that that's--that's me.

38:13.310 --> 38:14.850
That--that's not you.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.320
But I...

38:16.350 --> 38:17.390
I promise.
I promise.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.490
There--there will be no more second guessing.

38:20.510 --> 38:22.460
I'm--I'm just gonna take the leap.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.930
I--I'm gonna be like one of your patients.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.770
My life is in your hands.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.340
And not that you can't change your mind,because of course you have every right to.

38:29.370 --> 38:32.190
It's just that I don't wt to change it for you.

38:32.750 --> 38:39.240
So I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna hang back and--and wait,and,uh...

38:39.270 --> 38:41.700
and trust you.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.150
Well...
thank you.

38:46.630 --> 38:49.290
But I already called my social worker.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.980
She's sending me a new batch of files.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.460
Oh,no,no,no.
Please,please.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.020
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.
Don't do that.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.910
Don't do that.Robert and I are the same people that you picked.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.260
And--and we--

38:58.290 --> 39:04.020
kitty,there are plenty of babies out there,and you will be great mom to one of them.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.610
But this shouldn't be so complicated.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.670
- Life is complicated enough.
- No,you're right.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.470
You're right.
I-I-I agree.I agree.

39:10.490 --> 39:12.460
It shouldn't be so complicated.
You know what?

39:12.490 --> 39:14.710
It won'T.

39:15.650 --> 39:18.970
I'm sorry.
I-I really have to go.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.680
Good luck.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.280
<i>Justin</i>

39:38.940 --> 39:40.410
<i>Come in</i>

39:58.610 --> 40:00.360
woW.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.050
Hi.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.530
Is this,uh,always how you make up?

40:04.560 --> 40:07.850
No.
No.Um...

40:08.600 --> 40:10.380
I've just been thinking.

40:10.390 --> 40:12.670
You know that milestone we approached badly,

40:12.690 --> 40:16.470
the one we pretty much just smashed right into?

40:16.490 --> 40:18.840
Yes,I,uh,I remember.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.670
Yeah.
Um...

40:23.040 --> 40:24.970
I was scared.

40:25.580 --> 40:28.950
I've never said that to anyone before.

40:28.970 --> 40:31.280
It always just kind of made things seem so final,

40:31.310 --> 40:35.180
and nothing ever felt final to me...

40:35.850 --> 40:37.610
except this.

40:41.330 --> 40:46.840
I know that I said that I wanted to wait for the right moment,

40:46.870 --> 40:48.750
but there is no...

40:48.790 --> 40:50.650
right moment,

40:50.670 --> 40:52.930
because it's every moment.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.260
I love you.

40:59.410 --> 41:00.920
can I say it back?

41:01.650 --> 41:03.070
You better.

41:03.090 --> 41:04.990
I love you,too.

41:05.940 --> 41:07.910
Yogonna kiss me?

41:07.930 --> 41:09.420
Well...
