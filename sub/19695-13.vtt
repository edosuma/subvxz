WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.083
Previously on Shades of Blue.

00:02.127 --> 00:04.127
I'll do anything for Julia

00:05.214 --> 00:06.979
Tom Vecro, internal affairs.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.112
Keep up to good work.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.658
- I saw the feds at the dock.
- Feds.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.677
I gona make sure they dont get you.

00:12.893 --> 00:14.050
Sorry Dad.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.230
Don't find yourself
at Wozniak house tonight.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.469
You better not miss.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.476
Say something nice at his funeral..

00:19.561 --> 00:22.132
The assassination attempt,
it was staged.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.785
She knew it was gonna happen

00:23.815 --> 00:25.815
and the shooting at my house.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.859
it puts my son in a hospital.

00:27.903 --> 00:28.850
I killed Miguel

00:28.862 --> 00:30.862
He threatened me, to frame Christina.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.813
and I snaped his neck.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.560
Stahl was carry on pimpering Miguel.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.976
I brought some more.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.995
My best friend was killed because of me.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.542
If you though I was watching you before,

00:41.583 --> 00:43.824
you are not going to believe how close
I'm going to get now.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.158
Robert, your badge.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.678
Sick cause is poison you.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.191
It's soon going to heal you.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.758
This is handled, I have your back.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.444
Where did you put his body?

00:53.470 --> 00:54.937
where we used to take Christina

00:54.972 --> 00:56.972
That place is too good for Miguel.

02:09.054 --> 02:11.188
911, what's your emergency?

02:11.190 --> 02:15.058
Yeah, uh, I'd like to report
something strange

02:15.060 --> 02:17.594
on the old abandoned Greenbelt campsite.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.529
Is it an emergency?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.764
I think it's a dead body.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.933
I was hiking, my... my dog
started barking next to

02:23.935 --> 02:25.301
this metal container.

02:25.303 --> 02:27.464
May I ask what is your name, sir?

02:34.446 --> 02:36.980
Do you think Wozniak will get
the nod if Ayres becomes Mayor?

02:36.982 --> 02:38.314
Nod for what?

02:38.316 --> 02:39.616
Police commissioner.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.517
I don't think
he has political ambitions.

02:41.519 --> 02:43.052
Mom.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.858
I'll be up in a second.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.461
What's wrong, Cristina?
Why aren't you in school?

02:51.463 --> 02:53.156
He's dead.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.199
Who's dead?

02:56.535 --> 02:58.134
My dad.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.740
You can't know that.

03:03.742 --> 03:07.243
No, Grandma Lorena, um,
had to go to the morgue.

03:07.245 --> 03:10.079
But that just means
they don't know it's him.

03:10.081 --> 03:13.082
He's a missing person and they
found a John Doe that fits

03:13.084 --> 03:15.418
- his general description.
- No, no, he, um...

03:15.420 --> 03:17.487
He had to get surgery
when he broke his leg,

03:17.489 --> 03:21.291
and there were screws
with serial numbers.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.498
When did they find him?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.434
When we started this campaign,

03:31.436 --> 03:33.636
no one thought we stood a chance.

03:33.638 --> 03:35.104
To those who said...

03:35.106 --> 03:37.273
Yeah, she always did have
a way with words.

03:37.275 --> 03:39.275
Yeah, not the ones
you can say on television.

03:39.277 --> 03:41.110
Putting taxpayers' money to good use?

03:41.112 --> 03:43.279
Having friends in high places
should come with some perks.

03:43.281 --> 03:44.514
She hasn't won yet.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.648
Don't jinx it.

03:45.650 --> 03:47.784
We've had too many distractions lately.

03:47.786 --> 03:49.619
I don't care what happens at City Hall.

03:49.621 --> 03:52.622
The real work gets done
by us on the street.

03:52.624 --> 03:56.025
And I am here to say
that every vote counts.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.127
So get out and vote.

03:58.129 --> 03:59.929
Hmm.

03:59.931 --> 04:03.266
Your wife, your parents,
neighbors, friends...

04:07.405 --> 04:09.405
They found Miguel.

04:09.407 --> 04:11.407
An anonymous hiker early this morning.

04:11.409 --> 04:13.409
What... How did they ID him so fast?

04:13.411 --> 04:15.311
He had an orthopedic screw.

04:15.313 --> 04:17.579
Must've broke his leg
when he was in prison.

04:26.925 --> 04:28.925
I wish we burned Miguel in Raul's oven

04:28.927 --> 04:30.626
before they turned off the gas.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.462
You dumped him at an abandoned campsite.

04:32.464 --> 04:33.830
It should've been fine.

04:33.832 --> 04:36.265
So they found him... or, part of him.

04:36.267 --> 04:37.500
So what?

04:37.502 --> 04:39.002
It just means he's dead.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.603
It's not gonna come anywhere near you.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.271
It's away from Saperstein.

04:42.273 --> 04:43.506
Stahl knows.

04:43.508 --> 04:45.008
Stahl suspects.

04:45.010 --> 04:49.445
The lye dissolved any evidence
linking you to the body.

04:49.447 --> 04:50.813
Someone else could put it together.

04:50.815 --> 04:52.898
Miguel's mother knew that
I threatened him.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.918
_

04:54.943 --> 04:56.519
Do you think he told her
that I paid him off?

04:56.521 --> 04:57.954
Listen to me.

04:57.956 --> 05:01.424
You are not on the list of suspects.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.092
Miguel just got out of prison.

05:03.094 --> 05:07.230
He's a career criminal.
Just stay focused, all right?

05:07.232 --> 05:09.432
This is not gonna come back to us.

05:13.405 --> 05:17.573
Hi, I need a team
to execute a warrant search.

05:17.575 --> 05:20.076
It's an open homicide
involving a police officer.

05:20.078 --> 05:22.311
I should've never entangled
you in this mess.

05:22.313 --> 05:26.115
I entangled myself ten years ago.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.784
And I don't regret a single day of it.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.152
I would do...

05:29.154 --> 05:30.920
Go away!

05:30.922 --> 05:32.422
Hey.

05:32.424 --> 05:34.624
Detective Santos, can I please
have a conversation with you

05:34.626 --> 05:36.259
in the interrogation room?

05:36.261 --> 05:37.493
We're in the middle of something.

05:37.495 --> 05:39.295
It was politely phrased,
but it wasn't a request.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.496
It never is with you.

05:40.498 --> 05:42.265
You can come with me
voluntarily and answer

05:42.267 --> 05:45.134
a few questions, or you can both
hand over your badges right now.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.003
Refusing an Internal Affairs
interview is cause

05:47.005 --> 05:49.105
for immediate suspension.
You know that, Lieutenant.

05:49.107 --> 05:50.673
You know what they say about gamblers?

05:50.675 --> 05:53.443
It's not the winning
they're addicted to.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.445
It's the losing.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.848
I have a few questions
for you as well, Lieutenant.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.215
I believe you're both
intimately acquainted

05:59.217 --> 06:02.552
with the recently deceased
Miguel Zepeda.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.227
I know it's been
a rough few days for you,

06:09.229 --> 06:10.728
but certain evidence has
come to my attention

06:10.730 --> 06:12.147
that I can't ignore.

06:12.532 --> 06:15.566
Has this man ever assaulted you?

06:15.568 --> 06:17.468
Does punching my face in count?

06:17.470 --> 06:19.203
In most states.

06:19.205 --> 06:22.874
At what point did Miguel's habit
of punching your face in abate?

06:22.876 --> 06:25.343
When his habit of
boosting cars relocated him.

06:25.345 --> 06:28.246
Right, six-year stretch
on a grand theft auto,

06:28.248 --> 06:31.557
right back in for a homicide
a month after he was released.

06:31.584 --> 06:33.217
- Sad story.
- Yeah.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.542
And a common one.

06:34.544 --> 06:37.244
Lieutenant Wozniak was
the investigating officer

06:37.246 --> 06:39.341
on that homicide...

06:40.383 --> 06:42.950
about the time you joined up
with the squad.

06:42.952 --> 06:44.318
He's good at what he does.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.786
What's that? Sending the wrong guy up?

06:45.788 --> 06:47.321
I'm not confident he did.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.024
When Miguel's conviction
was vacated, you and Wozniak

06:50.026 --> 06:52.226
- had a big problem.
- How so?

06:52.228 --> 06:53.527
Guy spent almost a decade in a cage.

06:53.529 --> 06:56.097
You don't think he comes out
with a major axe to grind?

06:56.099 --> 06:59.934
That man took a part of me
that I will never get back.

06:59.936 --> 07:02.837
Dwelling on it won't accomplish
anything, so I decided

07:02.839 --> 07:08.109
a long time ago to never let him
steal another moment of my life.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.646
You never spoke in person
after his exoneration?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.381
I had no reason to.

07:14.383 --> 07:16.450
You had one.

07:20.604 --> 07:21.689
Yeah?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.549
We found something.

07:23.551 --> 07:24.517
In the garage?

07:24.519 --> 07:26.519
Along with a bag of lye.

07:26.521 --> 07:28.588
Back in a blink.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.595
If you have someplace to be, I can call,

07:35.597 --> 07:37.697
and I can cancel for you.
This could take a while.

07:37.699 --> 07:41.234
Well, I was thinking of
exercising my civic duty.

07:41.236 --> 07:43.603
While they still let you vote.

07:43.947 --> 07:46.439
- You know, felons.
- I get it.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.603
You do much yard work, Lieutenant?

07:51.605 --> 07:54.206
Enough to know when someone's
beating around the bush.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.633
'Cause we found some tools
in your garage so clean

07:57.635 --> 07:59.235
you'd think they'd never
touched a speck of dirt.

07:59.237 --> 08:02.805
As much as I'd love to sit
around here all day and trade...

08:02.807 --> 08:05.441
We found strands of hair in the drain

08:05.443 --> 08:06.742
on your garage floor.

08:06.744 --> 08:08.511
Long, black hair.

08:08.513 --> 08:10.379
Unless it's been down there
a real long time, I think it's

08:10.381 --> 08:11.514
a safe bet they're not yours.

08:11.516 --> 08:13.649
My dog has a great head of hair.

08:13.651 --> 08:16.319
Oh, right, right, well,
I guess we'll know soon enough.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.787
I mean, it's being analyzed right now.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.422
Quick search warrant. Good for you.

08:19.424 --> 08:22.291
Eh, just exercising my civic duty.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.287
The other night, when Bianchi had gunmen

08:27.289 --> 08:30.557
hose down Wozniak's house,
you heroically drove his son

08:30.559 --> 08:32.370
to the hospital, yes?

08:32.995 --> 08:35.828
I mean, I slammed my foot
on the pedal and made

08:35.831 --> 08:37.865
a few sharp turns.
I don't know how heroic that is.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.167
Officers at the hospital
discovered a shovel

08:40.169 --> 08:41.869
and a tarp in your trunk.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.306
Like I told them, I chip in

08:46.308 --> 08:47.975
at the Brooklyn Community Garden.

08:47.977 --> 08:50.911
One of three things
are gonna happen right now:

08:50.913 --> 08:53.547
You go down, Wozniak goes down,

08:53.549 --> 08:56.216
or you both go down.

08:56.218 --> 08:58.051
It's in your hands.

08:58.053 --> 08:59.920
You forgot option four.

08:59.922 --> 09:01.641
You keep running laps between us,

09:01.643 --> 09:03.056
and we give you nothing.

09:07.689 --> 09:10.322
All your years grinding
suspects into confessions...

09:11.367 --> 09:13.233
How many times did option four happen?

09:20.134 --> 09:21.534
Detective Loman.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.471
What's all this?

09:25.473 --> 09:27.206
Verco and his goons
are sweating Woz and Harlee

09:27.208 --> 09:28.307
about something.

09:28.309 --> 09:29.408
Something we need to worry about?

09:29.410 --> 09:30.910
I don't know, but Linda called.

09:30.912 --> 09:34.307
Said IA just ransacked their garage.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.617
Thanks, see you tomorrow.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.920
Field awareness 101,
not paying attention

09:40.922 --> 09:43.222
to your surroundings
can lead to trouble.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.583
Not as much as violating the conditions

09:45.585 --> 09:46.584
of your suspension.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.352
I'm just doing a little shopping.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.021
How's my Julia Ayres
investigation coming along?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.423
It's not your investigation
anymore, Robert.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.591
You know that.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.526
Taking down the next
Mayor-Elect of New York City,

09:55.528 --> 09:57.829
a big bust like that can put
a woman on the short list

09:57.831 --> 09:59.497
for Assistant Director.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.600
You were the one who stalked
Harlee's teenage daughter.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.535
You can't come back from that.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.305
Unless it became clear that
my actions were about exposing

10:07.307 --> 10:09.841
Harlee for who she truly is,
and that she manipulated

10:09.843 --> 10:11.642
this whole situation
to stop me from doing it.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.221
I gotta go.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.213
A woman's capable of murder,
she's capable of

10:15.215 --> 10:17.448
just about anything, wouldn't you say?

10:21.983 --> 10:26.491
It turns out Harlee is
a pretty scary ex-girlfriend.

10:29.376 --> 10:31.329
I know everything, Harlee.

10:32.031 --> 10:36.190
I know Miguel came to you angry,
making demands.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.018
You knew he wouldn't leave you alone,

10:38.020 --> 10:39.706
or your daughter.

10:40.756 --> 10:43.209
We'd do anything for our kids.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.257
Sure...

10:51.718 --> 10:53.636
Like cook dinner.

10:54.762 --> 10:56.403
So if you don't have
any more questions...

10:56.405 --> 10:58.038
All I have our questions.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.174
Questions seem to follow you
everywhere you go, Detective.

11:00.176 --> 11:02.142
I have questions about
Bianchi's abrupt ending.

11:02.144 --> 11:03.577
I left them unanswered.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.279
He took a shot at cops, after all.

11:05.281 --> 11:07.848
And tried to kill an ADA.

11:07.850 --> 11:09.216
Self-defense.

11:09.218 --> 11:12.366
From one human being to another,
I think you could claim

11:12.391 --> 11:13.690
the same thing too.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.117
Self-defense, justifiable homicide,

11:17.119 --> 11:19.653
but know that I have iron-clad forensics

11:19.655 --> 11:21.497
linking Wozniak to that body.

11:21.957 --> 11:24.357
If I don't hear the truth
straight from your mouth,

11:24.359 --> 11:26.760
he's facing an obstruction charge.

11:32.301 --> 11:34.201
Well...

11:37.472 --> 11:38.738
You're free to go.

11:39.015 --> 11:41.408
As soon as you confirm Harlee's story.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.777
I have four detectives who can testify

11:43.779 --> 11:47.647
that I've cooperated with you
for three hours.

11:47.649 --> 11:49.382
I'm going home.

11:49.384 --> 11:51.418
If you wanna waste more of my time,

11:51.420 --> 11:55.155
schedule a circle jerk
with my union rep.

11:55.157 --> 11:57.023
Give me a minute, Lieutenant.

11:57.025 --> 12:01.120
Miguel came at Harlee.
She defended herself.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.187
Should've called 911.
Instead, she panicked

12:03.189 --> 12:04.822
and hid the body.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.624
When she thought it was safe,
she moved the remains and

12:06.626 --> 12:08.793
used lye to accelerate nature.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.561
You wanted to help after the fact.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.696
She refused. I'm not exactly buying

12:12.698 --> 12:16.333
the last part, but, you know,
I'll take it with the rest.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.135
Swing and a miss.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.937
Nice playing with you.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.840
If you confirm that Harlee
borrowed your tools,

12:22.842 --> 12:26.410
I will speak to the DA
about mitigating circumstances.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.980
Manslaughter at worst, she's looking at

12:29.982 --> 12:32.902
maybe a dime, less with good behavior.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.419
The offer ends the moment you step

12:35.421 --> 12:37.490
out of that door, Lieutenant.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.201
Of course it does.

12:41.077 --> 12:43.627
'Cause that's the moment
your bluff collapses.

12:43.629 --> 12:46.416
That campsite where they found
what's left of Miguel.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.366
Harlee said you used
to take Cristina there

12:49.368 --> 12:52.130
when she was little
to look at the stars.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.406
What can I tell you?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.719
The lady finally cracked.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.180
The pressure of the last few days.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.581
Can you blame her?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.217
Do yourself a favor.

13:06.853 --> 13:10.087
When I crack, run.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.824
Hey.

13:22.745 --> 13:24.978
You cleaned the tools
you used at your house?

13:24.980 --> 13:27.114
Cleaning out the drain
must've slipped my mind

13:27.116 --> 13:29.667
once my son was shot.

13:31.053 --> 13:33.654
Verco said you cracked.

13:33.656 --> 13:35.923
What a coincidence.

13:35.925 --> 13:38.058
He told me you did.

13:41.504 --> 13:43.063
You didn't say anything to him?

13:43.065 --> 13:44.640
Zero.

13:45.808 --> 13:47.685
What?

13:49.228 --> 13:51.905
He knew the spot that I dumped Miguel

13:51.907 --> 13:55.234
was where we went camping with Cristina.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.714
I... In my apartment...

14:04.660 --> 14:06.253
Stahl.

14:06.704 --> 14:08.055
He must have ears in my house.

14:08.057 --> 14:11.884
He's our anonymous hiker and
sent the care package to Verco.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.462
Pasty-ass son of a bitch.
He's gotta go down.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.733
I still need to weigh in
on this election.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.358
Have you talked to Julia at all since...

14:20.360 --> 14:22.693
Hey, just focus on Stahl.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.098
You'll have to draw him in close.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.455
We're gonna get through this. I promise.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.458
This is Robert Stahl. Leave a message.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.874
I'm ready to give you what you want.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.688
I really don't know
where this road leads,

15:15.690 --> 15:19.058
but I can promise you one thing.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.395
I will never forget
the people who were with me

15:23.397 --> 15:24.991
from the beginning.

15:26.534 --> 15:30.336
You're the reason that I'm here,
and I am...

15:30.338 --> 15:32.338
I am truly grateful.

15:32.340 --> 15:36.075
So enjoy yourselves tonight,
but not too much because,

15:36.077 --> 15:38.110
hopefully, we're gonna have
a lot of work to do

15:38.112 --> 15:39.578
starting tomorrow morning.

15:46.087 --> 15:47.305
Hey.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.788
I'm glad you're here.

15:49.790 --> 15:51.523
I was afraid this party would be boring.

15:51.525 --> 15:53.759
We need to talk alone.

15:53.761 --> 15:56.328
Julia, WMBC and the "Post"
want five minutes.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.399
- Can it wait?
- No.

16:02.603 --> 16:04.736
You know, I got into this race
to bring up the issues...

16:04.738 --> 16:06.705
all the stuff we used to
talk about during those

16:06.707 --> 16:08.173
endless stakeouts.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.908
And now...

16:11.678 --> 16:13.247
Here we are.

16:13.981 --> 16:15.247
No thanks.

16:15.249 --> 16:17.585
Wow, that's gotta be a first.

16:24.758 --> 16:29.094
You know, there are several
hundred people out there

16:29.305 --> 16:34.268
throwing a party for me,
so what are we doing in here?

16:34.968 --> 16:36.968
Bianchi said that there's more to

16:36.970 --> 16:40.066
the story behind the shooting.

16:40.674 --> 16:42.140
He died.

16:42.142 --> 16:44.543
I didn't get a chance to hear it.

16:44.545 --> 16:48.032
God, he was just messing with your head.

16:49.325 --> 16:53.746
There's nothing that I'm missing?

16:55.957 --> 16:59.291
Bianchi got what he deserved.

16:59.794 --> 17:02.093
Now come on, let's go out
and eat those canapés

17:02.095 --> 17:04.362
I paid way too much for.

17:07.101 --> 17:09.201
Wozniak lives by a code.

17:09.203 --> 17:12.204
If you violate his home, his family,

17:12.205 --> 17:13.472
he'll come after you.

17:13.473 --> 17:15.941
- Are you saying...
- I am saying

17:15.943 --> 17:17.209
you better not miss.

17:17.211 --> 17:18.411
Tell me what I'm missing, Julia?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.744
That isn't what it sounds like.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.313
- Don't.
- Listen, I had to

17:21.315 --> 17:24.016
appease Bianchi, I had to.
It was only meant to

17:24.018 --> 17:25.851
scare you off. Nobody was supposed to

17:25.853 --> 17:28.186
- get hurt, nobody.
- You lie again,

17:28.189 --> 17:31.290
it's gonna be the last thing
that you say to me.

17:31.292 --> 17:34.996
I had to protect myself.

17:35.830 --> 17:38.497
You were gonna let the Feds
take me down.

17:38.499 --> 17:41.934
You did this. You, not me.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.970
You should've come to me
in the beginning.

17:44.972 --> 17:47.973
We could've found a way out together.

17:47.975 --> 17:50.843
I was doing everything I could.

17:51.220 --> 17:52.745
I was risking everything.

17:52.747 --> 17:55.948
But you couldn't save
both of us, could you?

17:55.950 --> 17:58.684
Harlee wouldn't let it go.
I mean, come on, Matt.

17:58.686 --> 18:02.721
I always knew it was gonna
come down to her or me.

18:02.723 --> 18:07.314
She didn't make you do this.

18:07.316 --> 18:14.008
And somehow I knew
it would end up being her.

18:14.135 --> 18:18.914
I would rather die than betray you.

18:20.575 --> 18:22.960
I trusted you.

18:25.246 --> 18:26.512
I loved you.

18:26.514 --> 18:31.344
You still do.

18:31.753 --> 18:33.846
You still do.

18:35.139 --> 18:36.889
Even if you don't know why.

18:37.211 --> 18:39.549
This can stay between us.

18:39.587 --> 18:40.886
It's the best for everyone.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.522
For you, for Nate.

18:44.348 --> 18:47.049
We have all made mistakes.

18:47.051 --> 18:49.153
You know mine. I know yours.

18:50.020 --> 18:54.909
But we can all walk away from this.

18:56.393 --> 18:59.728
It's tempting. It really is.

18:59.730 --> 19:02.798
It's the best way to go, Matt.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.169
It's the easy way.

19:10.174 --> 19:12.874
Late-breaking story
on this election night.

19:12.876 --> 19:15.944
Recordings have surfaced between
mayoral candidate Julia Ayres

19:15.946 --> 19:19.981
and the recently deceased mafia
boss Michael Bianchi.

19:19.983 --> 19:23.852
"New York Ledger" reporter
Nate Wozniak broke the story.

19:23.854 --> 19:26.722
It alleges Julia Ayres
worked with Bianchi

19:26.724 --> 19:28.857
to stage her own assassination attempt

19:28.859 --> 19:32.728
and to plan the attempted murder
of NYPD officers.

19:32.730 --> 19:37.478
I guess Nate didn't trust you
not to lose your nerve.

19:37.480 --> 19:41.002
No, I didn't trust myself.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.506
I gave Nate the nod.

19:43.508 --> 19:48.838
Between the two of us,
he's much braver than I.

19:49.547 --> 19:51.257
Why?

19:53.384 --> 19:55.785
Why didn't you just kill me?

19:55.787 --> 19:57.263
Why?

19:59.181 --> 20:02.858
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

20:20.711 --> 20:23.595
Julia, don't!

20:23.597 --> 20:26.183
I didn't... I didn't know.
I didn't know that Nate

20:26.185 --> 20:29.922
- was gonna be there.
- There's other ways, stop!

20:29.924 --> 20:35.458
If I had known any of it...

20:36.051 --> 20:38.294
You can make a deal

20:39.096 --> 20:44.927
- with the Feds, okay?
- Oh, no, I can't live

20:44.952 --> 20:48.153
- in a cage, Matt.
- Yes, you can, you can survive.

20:48.155 --> 20:52.124
No, I've survived too much already.

20:52.126 --> 20:56.629
I'm so tired of surviving. I'm so tired.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.200
Councilwoman?

21:01.102 --> 21:04.203
Don't make me face them.
Please, don't make me face them.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.375
- Julia, we have a problem.
- Please, Matt.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.337
Please.

21:14.549 --> 21:16.348
Please, forgive me.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.687
Please, Matt.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.222
Councilwoman?

21:27.528 --> 21:29.328
Please.

21:30.932 --> 21:34.466
Julia?

21:34.468 --> 21:37.002
The votes have been cast and counted.

21:37.004 --> 21:41.408
Julia Ayres has been elected mayor.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.543
I'm the Mayor of New York.

22:13.666 --> 22:19.670
Lieutenant? Matt?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.839
I tried to stop her.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.941
She was too far away.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.210
They waited to pronounce
at the hospital.

22:26.212 --> 22:29.480
The chief is headed there now
to release the news officially.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.489
Julia's dead.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.413
After hearing that tape,
I suppose there was only one

22:34.415 --> 22:36.797
real likely outcome.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.654
I wasn't sure you were going to come.

23:01.748 --> 23:05.816
Well, you and a cryptic invitation.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.252
Tough combination to resist.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.987
Oh, I thought I was pretty clear.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.041
"Give me what I want."

23:12.875 --> 23:14.581
Longer list than you might imagine.

23:14.583 --> 23:16.827
You and I both know what's at the top.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.663
Oh, you must be in a bad way
to make that offer.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.432
Well, you should know.

23:21.884 --> 23:23.968
You seem to have ears everywhere.

23:24.345 --> 23:27.171
How did you hack into my Wi-Fi?

23:27.890 --> 23:28.814
Cristina?

23:28.816 --> 23:30.149
I know that you have to be vigilant

23:30.151 --> 23:31.717
with home networks these days.

23:31.719 --> 23:34.146
There's all kinds of malware out there.

23:34.989 --> 23:37.056
Well, server's down now.

23:37.058 --> 23:39.925
No keepsake recordings tonight.

23:39.927 --> 23:41.760
I sent an email to myself, Harlee.

23:41.762 --> 23:45.397
It said that I was meeting you
here... time, date, and location,

23:45.399 --> 23:47.633
just in case you were planning
on solving this problem

23:47.635 --> 23:49.068
the same way you solved Miguel.

23:49.070 --> 23:52.271
This isn't about payback, okay?

23:52.273 --> 23:53.999
No gun.

23:54.842 --> 24:00.846
This is about me asking you
to make it go away.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.416
This is what you wanted.

24:04.418 --> 24:08.305
If it isn't, why hold onto
the silver bullet?

24:09.090 --> 24:10.589
You must have a recording of everything

24:10.591 --> 24:13.192
Wozniak and I said here last night.

24:13.194 --> 24:17.196
That's enough to put me away
for a very long time.

24:17.198 --> 24:21.366
But you didn't use it,
'cause you don't want me

24:21.368 --> 24:22.968
to go away.

24:22.970 --> 24:29.241
You want me right here
in front of you, needing you.

24:29.243 --> 24:33.245
If you want something from me,
Harlee, then say what you mean.

24:33.247 --> 24:36.215
I'm gonna go to prison
for killing Miguel,

24:36.217 --> 24:39.051
but we both know you can
stop that from happening.

24:39.336 --> 24:41.338
How exactly would I do that?

24:42.172 --> 24:44.123
Help me put the body on someone else.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.562
And it's just that easy for you, huh?

24:50.564 --> 24:52.431
Frame someone else for murder.

24:52.433 --> 24:54.600
Ruin another life.

24:54.893 --> 24:57.569
His life is already ruined, like mine,

24:57.571 --> 24:58.837
so none of it matters.

24:58.839 --> 25:01.607
"His"? So you've already got

25:01.609 --> 25:04.109
- someone in mind then?
- Caddie.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.111
I don't know if you
shot him up intentionally,

25:06.113 --> 25:10.591
or you gave him the drugs
to do it himself, but you and I

25:10.593 --> 25:14.086
both know that his death is on you.

25:14.088 --> 25:16.088
That's how you found Saperstein's grave.

25:16.090 --> 25:19.625
Caddie's death falls at
the feet of his own addiction.

25:19.627 --> 25:21.860
Well, that's not a denial.

25:24.131 --> 25:27.032
Just walking through the door
gave me the creeps.

25:27.034 --> 25:29.609
Yeah, be careful
not to touch any surfaces,

25:29.695 --> 25:31.561
especially if there's a picture
of Harlee nearby.

25:31.563 --> 25:33.496
This laptop is full of 'em.

25:33.498 --> 25:36.199
This FBI guy has a real stalker vibe.

25:40.806 --> 25:43.640
Framing a man for murder
requires evidence.

25:43.642 --> 25:45.152
I've got that covered.

25:47.346 --> 25:51.214
After I found Caddie's body,
I searched his place.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.817
For any dirt that might
come back on you.

25:53.819 --> 25:55.652
You're always looking out
for number one, aren't you?

25:55.654 --> 25:59.333
Says the guy who killed Caddie
to gain control over me.

26:00.158 --> 26:03.259
He still had the boots that
he wore to the cemetery.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.833
The chisel that made dental
identification impossible.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.168
Caddie was there for me, and if he could

26:12.170 --> 26:14.537
help me right now, he would.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.439
So where's this evidence?

26:16.441 --> 26:18.174
I assume you want me
to place it somewhere

26:18.176 --> 26:21.688
it can be found, transfer
any suspicion away from you.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.150
That's exactly what needs to happen.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.218
Video file deleted.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.286
Let's get out of here, man.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.244
I get?

26:36.895 --> 26:38.580
Whatever you want.

26:39.998 --> 26:45.568
I know that you hate me
just as much as you want me.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.471
That's why you dimed me out to Verco.

26:48.473 --> 26:51.426
So I would need you to save me.

26:55.914 --> 26:58.014
Maybe I just decided it was
finally time you paid for

26:58.016 --> 26:59.416
all the things you've done, Harlee.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.318
It's a long list of desperate acts.

27:02.320 --> 27:06.423
If it keeps our little secret
between us, I'm willing

27:06.425 --> 27:08.525
to add to it.

27:12.831 --> 27:16.660
Once you go down this road,
Harlee, there's no stopping.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.121
Be sure.

27:20.672 --> 27:23.106
I've made my choice.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.180
This is surrender.

27:55.974 --> 27:58.408
You forget how well I know you, Harlee.

28:18.930 --> 28:21.433
I accept your surrender.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.252
The NYPD has confirmed
that Mayor-Elect Ayres

28:33.254 --> 28:35.721
was declared dead at
New York Presbyterian Hospital

28:35.723 --> 28:38.858
with what's been reported as
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

28:38.860 --> 28:40.593
Earlier tonight, the "New York Ledger"

28:40.595 --> 28:42.061
broke the news of a secret recording

28:42.063 --> 28:43.829
between Ayres and the recently deceased

28:43.831 --> 28:46.832
head of the Bianchi crime family.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.434
Oh, my God, Woz, what happened?

28:48.436 --> 28:50.403
Did Julia really kill herself?
Were you there?

28:50.405 --> 28:51.837
I just drove past her block.

28:51.839 --> 28:53.172
Harlee's light is still on.

28:53.174 --> 28:54.607
Yeah, she hasn't contacted us.

28:54.609 --> 28:57.143
Well, how long does it take
to make a guy pass out?

28:57.145 --> 28:59.471
She's not answering her phone.

28:59.981 --> 29:02.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we can't just storm in.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.915
Look, if Stahl makes us,
this whole thing's a bust.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.217
That's why we parked out of sight.

29:05.219 --> 29:06.685
Who said anything about storming in?

29:08.989 --> 29:11.723
Harlee? Harlee?

29:15.495 --> 29:16.828
She didn't get his fingerprints on it.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.730
We don't have anything to plant
at the crime scene.

29:18.732 --> 29:20.198
Nothing for the campsite.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.167
This is the only scene
I'm concerned about.

29:28.709 --> 29:30.408
Clothes are missing.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.436
I was wondering when you were
gonna come out of it.

29:49.604 --> 29:51.129
You okay?

29:51.131 --> 29:53.024
You feel sick?

29:54.609 --> 29:56.101
I'll get you some water.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.174
What did you do to me?

30:03.535 --> 30:06.144
Your clothes got a little
dirty when I moved you.

30:06.746 --> 30:08.680
I would never take advantage like that.

30:09.165 --> 30:11.293
And you've always looked great in black.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.719
They're gonna come looking for me.

30:14.721 --> 30:16.354
Come on.

30:17.007 --> 30:18.857
Harlee, take it. Drugs dehydrate you.

30:24.222 --> 30:27.092
Harlee, you were the one
with the loaded syringe.

30:27.094 --> 30:28.560
Not me.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.528
I just followed your lead.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.523
Now come on, you gotta drink.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.135
There we go. Good girl.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.337
Good.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.839
Good girl.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.377
Where are we?

30:47.379 --> 30:49.247
It's nice, right?

30:50.549 --> 30:55.185
The owner bought this as
an investment property.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.620
Mostly vacation rentals now.

30:57.622 --> 31:00.457
I'll tell you, when the season's over,

31:01.051 --> 31:03.727
this place is so quiet and solitary.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.529
Wozniak knew I was meeting you.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.398
Harlee, you had a lot of heat
coming down on you

31:08.400 --> 31:10.300
from Internal Affairs.

31:10.685 --> 31:13.436
Pending DNA results,
it was just a matter of time.

31:13.438 --> 31:16.850
I think Wozniak will
understand why you ran.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.403
And left my daughter behind?

31:18.428 --> 31:22.739
I know, I know that was hard,

31:24.149 --> 31:25.782
but it's better that she's abandoned

31:25.784 --> 31:27.350
than living some life on the run.

31:27.352 --> 31:31.387
Right now, she has a chance
at a good life, and I think

31:31.389 --> 31:32.555
that's noble, Harlee.

31:32.557 --> 31:36.159
That's a noble sacrifice. I admire that.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.796
That's the kind of loving mother
I always knew you were.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.001
Espada's back at
the precinct scanning through

31:45.003 --> 31:46.235
traffic cam footage.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.537
He'll let us know when he's got a hit.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.205
There's a city-wide APB out on her car.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.507
State Police and Highway Patrol
are on the lookout as well.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.101
It's been hours. They could be anywhere.

31:54.245 --> 31:58.948
- Packed her clothes, car's gone...
- But Woz, she would never run.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.850
- She would never do that.
- He's trying to make it

32:00.852 --> 32:02.384
look like she did.

32:02.386 --> 32:04.286
I mean, he needs a place that's remote.

32:04.288 --> 32:07.323
So he's thinking on the fly,
so he's probably gonna want

32:07.325 --> 32:09.191
something that's familiar to him.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.727
So we'll pull his financials,
and we'll see if he has

32:11.729 --> 32:13.095
any real estate nearby.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.665
What makes you so sure he...
he took her somewhere?

32:16.667 --> 32:19.902
'Cause I don't think
he wants to kill her.

32:19.904 --> 32:23.739
He wants her all for himself first.

32:23.741 --> 32:27.209
Hey, everybody, did I miss roll call?

32:27.211 --> 32:29.011
You know, if you're planning
to escape, Lieutenant,

32:29.013 --> 32:30.859
I suggest losing the entourage.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.308
Harlee is missing.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.340
Probably figured the DNA
results would be conclusive

32:35.342 --> 32:38.408
and decided to run,
but we will find her.

32:38.410 --> 32:41.390
For now, I'm gonna have to
detain you, Lieutenant.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.882
He's not going anywhere.

32:42.884 --> 32:44.960
Finally drank the Kool-Aid, I see.

32:44.962 --> 32:47.396
You guys are hell-bent
on sharing a cell block, huh?

32:47.398 --> 32:49.830
You a quick draw, Detective?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.053
Maybe I was wrong about the entourage.

32:54.055 --> 32:57.690
If you wanna solve
Miguel Zepeda's murder,

32:57.692 --> 32:59.325
look into Robert Stahl.

32:59.327 --> 33:03.429
He's a former FBI agent.
He's obsessed with Harlee.

33:03.431 --> 33:05.765
He killed Zepeda, and now he has her.

33:05.767 --> 33:07.567
I bet he washed his tools
in your garage.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.369
He needed me out of the way.

33:09.371 --> 33:12.372
He knows I'd do anything to get Harlee.

33:12.374 --> 33:13.971
So I should just take your word for it.

33:13.973 --> 33:15.642
After all, you've been
so stand-up with me, right?

33:15.644 --> 33:18.211
If you did five minutes
of actual detective work,

33:18.213 --> 33:20.279
you wouldn't have to take
anyone's word for it.

33:20.281 --> 33:24.736
You get in the way of us finding Harlee,

33:25.904 --> 33:30.921
one of your Internal Affairs
cronies is finally gonna

33:30.923 --> 33:36.229
get the chance to arrest me
for what I do to you.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.876
Hard to eat with no hands.

33:41.878 --> 33:43.278
The last time your hands were free,

33:43.280 --> 33:45.080
you tried to jab a needle in me.

33:53.357 --> 33:54.823
Seriously?

33:54.825 --> 33:58.159
Remember your scenario training, Harlee.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.896
Survival first.

34:01.465 --> 34:02.941
- Open.
- No.

34:04.368 --> 34:07.502
Fine, suit yourself,
you'll get hungry eventually.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.472
Woz and Linda are Cristina's guardians

34:11.474 --> 34:13.174
if something happens to me.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.775
If Miguel's murder gets put on him...

34:14.777 --> 34:17.545
I know that Cristina
is the most important thing

34:17.547 --> 34:19.541
in your life, Harlee.

34:20.684 --> 34:23.210
I'll always look out for her. I promise.

34:24.712 --> 34:27.855
I guess that means
we're not going far, then.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.676
How does this end?

34:31.561 --> 34:32.627
Robert?

34:36.132 --> 34:41.101
Well, if you are not
gonna eat, you should rest.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.524
Close your eyes for a while.

34:45.541 --> 34:49.277
Wait, I think I am a little hungry.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.919
Now that's my girl.

35:00.039 --> 35:01.322
Here we go.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.524
Open.

35:03.526 --> 35:07.762
Oh, sorry.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.717
Whoops, I'm new at this.

35:12.135 --> 35:14.502
Now let's try that again.

35:26.075 --> 35:28.108
Found this under his bed.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.642
And a pair of muddy boots in the closet.

35:30.644 --> 35:34.613
Have CSU dust for fingerprints
and check for our victim's DNA.

35:40.021 --> 35:43.288
Tony, put out a BOLO
on FBI Agent Robert Stahl.

35:43.290 --> 35:45.491
He's to be considered armed, dangerous,

35:45.493 --> 35:47.879
and likely holding a hostage.

35:49.563 --> 35:51.263
Any luck with the real estate?

35:51.265 --> 35:53.399
No dice, Stahl doesn't own any
property outside of the city.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.167
Woz, Woz, you got any idea
what the hell Gail Baker's

35:55.169 --> 35:56.435
doing in your office?

35:58.031 --> 35:59.764
How sure are you that Stahl has her?

35:59.766 --> 36:02.100
You don't have time
to cover your ass, Gail.

36:02.102 --> 36:04.936
I heard Harlee was a person
of interest in a homicide, Matt.

36:04.938 --> 36:06.838
From who? Stahl?

36:06.840 --> 36:08.974
Harlee wouldn't go anywhere
without Cristina.

36:08.976 --> 36:10.526
You know that.

36:12.613 --> 36:15.647
I can assign an HRT team

36:15.649 --> 36:17.382
to assist in the search.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.685
You run deep background checks
on your employees, correct?

36:20.687 --> 36:22.320
Does Stahl have any property?

36:22.322 --> 36:23.321
Not that I'm aware of.

36:23.323 --> 36:24.489
What about his dead partner?

36:24.491 --> 36:26.825
Do you want me to run
every property owned by agents

36:26.827 --> 36:28.426
in New York, Matt?

36:28.428 --> 36:31.062
Gail, you're too good
at your job not to know

36:31.064 --> 36:33.531
that Stahl was screwing
his partner's wife

36:33.533 --> 36:35.752
- while he was undercover.
- If I had known that,

36:35.777 --> 36:36.943
he would've been gone a long time ago.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.012
You've been doing damage control for him

36:39.014 --> 36:40.180
since you picked me up!

36:40.182 --> 36:41.981
I'd check your sources on that, Matt.

36:41.983 --> 36:44.450
And you've been feeding
information to Internal Affairs

36:44.452 --> 36:47.754
so one of us gets pinched so
Stahl's investigation blows up,

36:47.756 --> 36:49.389
and you can cut him loose!

36:49.391 --> 36:51.791
I'm not gonna let you do
the same thing to Harlee.

36:51.793 --> 36:55.161
Where was Stahl screwing his mistress?

36:55.163 --> 36:57.463
They met somewhere upstate.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.565
It was her place. That's all I know.

36:58.567 --> 37:00.266
Do you have an address?

37:00.268 --> 37:01.601
I can get it.

37:07.842 --> 37:09.442
You wore a wire.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.244
You gave me enough evidence
to convince the highers up

37:11.246 --> 37:14.257
this wasn't a colossal waste of time.

37:15.258 --> 37:18.051
That terminates your obligation
to the bureau, Matt.

37:18.053 --> 37:20.353
I wish I could say "congratulations."

37:31.633 --> 37:34.601
Oh, God, I love this time of year.

37:34.603 --> 37:36.821
The smell of cedar.

37:38.031 --> 37:42.008
My father taught me the trick

37:42.785 --> 37:45.044
to starting a good fire

37:45.872 --> 37:47.947
is you gotta split the wood first.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.565
The cracks expose it to the heat.

38:01.015 --> 38:04.016
Have you ever watched a moth
circle around a flame, Harlee?

38:04.490 --> 38:05.865
It's pure instinct.

38:06.934 --> 38:09.355
It's a desire that's
so consuming you just cannot

38:09.357 --> 38:11.647
fight it with logic or reason.

38:13.608 --> 38:14.773
Why would you want to?

38:15.651 --> 38:18.910
It's a beautiful thing,
just kind of dancing

38:18.912 --> 38:21.199
on the edges of survival.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.082
The danger, the pain,
none of that matters.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.484
It doesn't mean anything.

38:25.486 --> 38:31.823
And once you get close enough,
actually feel the heat,

38:32.293 --> 38:33.825
the burning, and you realize

38:34.504 --> 38:38.890
it's been your entire purpose,
and that's why you don't let go.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.908
That's why you push yourself
further into the flame,

38:42.428 --> 38:49.108
giving up all resistance,
consumed entirely.

38:53.362 --> 38:54.666
Never more alive.

39:03.699 --> 39:09.062
You have got goosebumps.

39:15.669 --> 39:17.970
We're both getting warmer.

39:26.347 --> 39:29.381
Oh, Harlee, all I ever
wanted to do was help you.

39:29.809 --> 39:32.103
You said you were gonna heal me.

39:34.188 --> 39:36.482
I tried.

39:37.817 --> 39:39.485
You weren't ready.

39:42.738 --> 39:44.699
I am now.

39:47.076 --> 39:49.078
Prove it.

39:51.622 --> 39:53.472
If you really love me...

39:59.563 --> 40:01.382
Save me.

40:04.184 --> 40:06.818
God...

40:06.820 --> 40:08.787
Damn it, Harlee!

40:15.195 --> 40:17.375
Why would you do this to yourself?

40:17.377 --> 40:19.064
Help me.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.486
I can't... I can't stop it.

40:25.506 --> 40:28.006
Help me. I need you.

40:28.008 --> 40:29.207
Help me!

40:39.987 --> 40:41.520
That's better.

40:44.291 --> 40:47.392
If you thought I was gonna let
you go that easily, Harlee...

40:47.394 --> 40:54.332
And if you thought I would
ever let you touch me

40:54.334 --> 40:56.334
you're crazier than you seem.

41:03.777 --> 41:05.930
We've got our location.
Let's go get our girl.

41:05.932 --> 41:08.380
- Where is she?
- It's a drive.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.620
Lieutenant, I need to talk to you.

41:23.622 --> 41:25.288
Adrian, I can't talk right now.

41:25.290 --> 41:26.590
I have an emergency.

41:26.592 --> 41:28.091
Quince took my mom.

41:28.093 --> 41:29.860
You were supposed to keep her safe.

41:55.220 --> 41:57.787
Oh!

42:07.032 --> 42:09.908
All right, look, look,
go upstairs, talk to

42:09.910 --> 42:12.780
anybody in a uniform, okay?
They'll help you.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.655
Come on, Woz, we gotta go!

42:14.657 --> 42:16.491
We'll get your mom back, I promise.

42:16.493 --> 42:17.759
I'm sorry.

42:18.895 --> 42:20.394
Woz!

42:31.824 --> 42:34.609
Somebody!

42:42.452 --> 42:43.785
We need medics here!

42:43.787 --> 42:45.653
Hold on, boss, hold on!

42:45.655 --> 42:48.456
Oh, my God, don't talk.
Don't try to talk, okay?

42:48.458 --> 42:50.291
Stay with us!

42:52.929 --> 42:54.295
Come on, boss, stay awake!
