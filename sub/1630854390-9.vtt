00:08.592 --> 00:12.596
Hey, where's my daughter?
You're supposed to be picking mushrooms.

00:13.096 --> 00:16.265
Look, it was supposed to just be a date.
-Well, where is she?

00:16.265 --> 00:18.519
She wanted to see my town and--
-Where is she now?

00:19.186 --> 00:20.604
I don't know. She--

00:20.604 --> 00:22.731
We just talked and-- Yeah, I--

00:23.732 --> 00:25.442
What? You never brought her home?

00:26.610 --> 00:28.779
She stole my truck, okay? Ridley's truck.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.614
I was lucky to catch her. She--
-Where?

00:30.614 --> 00:33.200
To Playa. To the bus stop.
-She doesn't have any money.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.786
I gave her everything I had, okay?
Look, I--

00:36.828 --> 00:39.373
I love her, okay? I want the best for her.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.796
You know, she said you told her
to go ahead and leave.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.299
And not come back.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.893
I see you, you little shit!
Get your ass over here!

01:04.147 --> 01:05.274
She'll be back.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.986
But you don't know that.
And you told her to leave.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.488
She's a survivor.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.367
Maybe we don't tell your mother just yet.
-Why?

01:17.327 --> 01:20.706
Well, sometimes telling a half-truth
is better than hurting someone.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.794
Might seem paradoxical, but I'm trying
to keep us together. Understand?

01:29.298 --> 01:30.299
I've got kitchen duty.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.149
There's this.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.818
Or there's this one.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.955
I haven't posted since we got here.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.707
My followers probably think I'm dead.

04:15.631 --> 04:16.798
No.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.635
Sorry. You look American.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.933
<i>Hola.</i>
-<i>Hola.</i>

04:27.559 --> 04:28.560
<i>Si.</i>

04:31.980 --> 04:33.273
No. <i>Gracias</i>.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.696
...Hotel MarquÃ©s Miramar?

04:42.366 --> 04:43.367
Okay.

04:49.957 --> 04:50.958
<i>Gracias</i>.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.048
So, here's my mission and the target.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.468
It's a new 1,000-megawatt plant
that came online last year,

05:43.468 --> 05:46.430
and they tried to hide
the bloody thing 'cause it's coal-fired.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.975
And they don't want people complaining
about ash in their drinking water.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.353
Yeah, or the liver and kidney damage,
or the variety of cancers.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.106
What's this transmission tower
on the right?

05:56.106 --> 05:57.608
Feeds into a new development.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.277
And the left?
-Goes to the regional Ministry of Mines

06:00.277 --> 06:01.570
and the Interior.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.031
Wow, this is big.

06:05.199 --> 06:08.243
What kind of explosives
and detonator? Timer or remote?

06:08.243 --> 06:12.497
Remote. Controlled.
No one gets hurt this time.

06:12.497 --> 06:17.211
The investors flee, and the politicians
find an easier way to line their pockets.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.213
How do you deliver the payload?

06:19.713 --> 06:22.049
We got a truck.
-And back out, after?

06:22.633 --> 06:25.177
Don't worry. We have a solid plan.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.639
Where do you want me?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.517
At home reading a book.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.270
No, I'm serious. I want part of this.

06:36.647 --> 06:41.485
It sets a template for the Amazon, Borneo,
everywhere the world's on fire.

06:43.987 --> 06:44.988
When?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.823
Still TBD.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.298
Attach to the chassis?

07:04.174 --> 07:07.010
No. In the back.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.304
And driven up to the turbines.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.724
Yeah.

07:17.688 --> 07:18.689
You know...

07:22.901 --> 07:26.029
I could use you as a spotter.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.700
We could go for a scout.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.393
Hey, Mom.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.316
What's going on in there?
-Silvia's on a tear.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.361
There was a-- another raid today,
and they took the pigs.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.201
Listen, I know how much you love it here.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.078
But what if I was to tell you that

08:15.078 --> 08:18.165
I'm working on something
to get us back to the States?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.376
With Dad too?

08:25.130 --> 08:28.342
We haven't thought that far, but...

08:31.303 --> 08:32.596
You're really doing this?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.519
I like Dad's plan better.

08:39.895 --> 08:40.895
And what's his plan?

08:44.191 --> 08:48.820
I don't know. It's just a place,
but it's not the States.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.074
Seen your sister?

08:55.577 --> 08:57.788
I haven't seen her for a few hours.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.208
Any idea where she is?

09:01.959 --> 09:05.629
I think maybe on the boat with Adolfo.
Can I put these down?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.214
Sure.

09:27.860 --> 09:31.572
Hi. Yeah, excuse me. I'm
basically bringing this bike back because

09:31.572 --> 09:34.741
it's making this
super sketchy clicking noise like...

09:36.118 --> 09:38.662
I don't know, there's something
seriously wrong with it. It's deadly.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.372
So I'm just wondering, who do I speak to

09:40.372 --> 09:43.208
about making sure
my dad doesn't get charged for that?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.334
Concierge, miss.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.754
Thanks.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.180
May I offer you
a chamomile-hibiscus water?

10:38.180 --> 10:41.141
Sure.
-Please close your eyes.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.977
What's your name?
-Dina.

10:43.977 --> 10:50.484
Dina, take a deep breath in, as we offer
you a cleansing of body and spirit.

10:51.944 --> 10:55.948
May your heart be cleansed,
that you might hear its messages clearly.

10:56.532 --> 11:00.661
May your throat be cleansed,
that you might speak truthfully.

11:02.371 --> 11:07.000
May your body here find rest at
the Miramar Hotel Spa and Resort.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.504
He's hitting an electrical plant.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.756
Really? Well, it's a nice target.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.178
You know, that target per se doesn't do me
any good unless I've got an exact time.

11:59.178 --> 12:01.388
I need both or the deal's off.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.600
Yeah, and I told you I need
to see my deal in writing.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.603
I'm out here risking my fucking life.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.147
<i>I told you I'm gonna be there.
I'm a spotter.</i>

12:10.147 --> 12:12.649
So get me the agreement signed by you,
your superiors,

12:12.649 --> 12:14.902
<i>fucking Donald Duck
if he has a say in this.</i>

12:16.111 --> 12:19.406
Listen, Margot,
I know this hasn't been easy.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.492
Everything feels easy when you're doing it
to save your kids.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.913
I need my paperwork,
and then I'll get you the time.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.436
What are you doing here, Allie?
-Hear me out.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.355
Why the fuck are you using my computer?

12:53.106 --> 12:56.276
I have a solution
to your Guillermo problem. Look.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.577
A bunch of packages
and a hole with shit in it?

13:05.577 --> 13:09.414
Those are Guillermo's packages.
That's Guillermo's shit.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.250
Skimming from the cartels.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.712
Not enough to be detected without
examination, but enough to sell.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.589
So this is how he's making his money?

13:18.674 --> 13:19.758
Fuck.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.345
I have right now what I need
to bring him down. Permanently.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.640
I'm gonna go see him today
because he has something that I want.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.768
And if I get it,
it can solve your problems too.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.813
He'll fucking kill you. And me.
And Casa Roja.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.231
I'm sure he would like that.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.068
But I'm putting in a dead man's switch
to Sandpiper.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.320
I've got the fucker. I've got him.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.118
So you want to be landlord now, huh?

13:46.118 --> 13:50.122
No interest in that.
Not even sure my place is here anymore.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.416
What's in it for you, Allie?

13:56.086 --> 14:01.592
Safe place for us. My family.
No landlords.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.643
Be quick.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.155
Where's Fox?

14:23.155 --> 14:24.406
I haven't seen him today.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.866
You know where to find him.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.950
Tell me where he is.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.495
Don't touch me!
I'm telling you I haven't seen him.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.289
Let go of me!

14:32.289 --> 14:33.832
Do you want me to take
you to his house?

14:33.832 --> 14:35.375
Take us. Let's go.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.960
You don't have to grab me!

14:36.960 --> 14:38.212
Walk!

14:38.754 --> 14:40.005
Walk!

15:03.737 --> 15:05.614
Bitch, you're stalling.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.407
Tell me! Where is Fox?

15:07.991 --> 15:09.201
Where is he?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.703
Speak up! Where's Fox?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.458
Where's Fox?

15:18.085 --> 15:19.545
Speak up!

15:34.476 --> 15:35.561
Charlie.
-Silvia.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.522
Charlie, come. Charlie, no.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.066
Stop!
-Charlie.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.192
Hey!

15:45.279 --> 15:46.655
No!

15:46.655 --> 15:48.198
Silvia.

15:48.699 --> 15:49.700
Hey!

15:57.749 --> 15:58.792
Charlie!

16:02.880 --> 16:04.173
Charlie!

16:23.483 --> 16:26.612
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Rita.
These are your keys.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.322
Thank you. Hold this.

16:42.961 --> 16:47.007
Hi, excuse me, sorry,
you only gave us three keys.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.928
Me and my sisters really don't wanna
have to share a key. You know?

16:50.928 --> 16:52.346
Oh, yes, of course.

16:53.639 --> 16:54.806
There you are.
-Thanks.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.355
Crap, I lost them.
What's the room number again?

17:02.773 --> 17:04.191
208.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.151
Great. Thanks.
-Welcome.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.595
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

20:19.595 --> 20:24.308
You were given 72 hours to get Sandpiper
up and running. How's that going?

20:25.309 --> 20:27.686
Well, turns out I only needed 24.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.440
So, did something I haven't done
in a very long time.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.651
Took a mental health day.

20:35.569 --> 20:39.364
Hiked into the jungle.
Found a little cabin in your woods.

20:43.785 --> 20:47.706
I have no idea what
the fuck you're talking about!

20:49.583 --> 20:51.502
Might wanna ask Roy Orbison here to leave.

20:52.503 --> 20:53.545
No, stay.

20:55.631 --> 20:56.673
Up to you.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.635
I found your skimming operation.

21:01.678 --> 21:02.888
Excuse me?

21:03.555 --> 21:04.556
I think you know.

21:05.641 --> 21:09.603
He transports shipments for cartels.
Skims off the top.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.897
That's not very honest, is it?
-He's lying.

21:12.523 --> 21:15.359
I'm trying to save Casa Roja
from being demolished, that's all.

21:16.485 --> 21:21.365
<i>Tumbadores</i>. Right? You've heard
that word. You work for the cartels.

21:21.365 --> 21:23.742
<i>Tumbadores.</i> Means thief.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.370
Traitor.

21:27.371 --> 21:30.582
Bill, you speak a little Spanish, right?
Does that sound about right?

21:43.387 --> 21:44.555
You're a dead man.

21:45.430 --> 21:49.476
Really? I'm not so sure it's me.
I have proof.

22:02.364 --> 22:05.450
Photos, documents. All in the cloud.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.621
If I don't confirm
I'm okay every few hours,

22:09.621 --> 22:11.582
your operation automatically goes wide.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.793
To people you don't want to see it.

22:14.793 --> 22:15.878
Is that right?

22:20.841 --> 22:22.050
I don't give a shit.

22:24.595 --> 22:26.180
What the fuck do you want?

22:27.514 --> 22:28.515
A place.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.519
It's on the Eastern coast of the state,
Nocera Peninsula.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.812
Nice little chunk of land.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.609
My family has many
nice little chunks of land.

22:39.276 --> 22:42.487
Well, this one's 20 miles wide,
about 30 miles long.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.408
I want it.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.620
Transfer the deed to me.
Clean transaction.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.414
Or what?

22:54.791 --> 22:56.752
Or Zetas will pay you a visit.

22:58.212 --> 23:01.924
And I'm guessing they'll come to collect
everything you took, with interest.

23:11.558 --> 23:15.062
Get the fuck out of here.
Where did you get that shirt?

23:16.063 --> 23:17.231
This?

23:17.231 --> 23:22.986
Yes, it's so stupid.
It's the dumbest. I need it.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.989
I got it--

23:26.573 --> 23:28.617
Annie, come look at this girl's shirt.
-What is it?

23:28.617 --> 23:29.701
We need that.

23:31.036 --> 23:34.081
Holy shit, that shirt sucks. It's amazing!

23:34.915 --> 23:36.208
Thanks.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.336
I like your boots btdubs.
Are you here with your parents?

23:40.921 --> 23:43.924
Yeah. They're kayaking.

23:43.924 --> 23:48.887
Well, hi. I'm Annie. This is Claire.
We're from Connecticut.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.389
Where are you from?

23:51.014 --> 23:54.601
From the States. From the city. Yeah.
-Cool.

23:55.185 --> 23:58.021
Are you guys sisters?
-No, everyone thinks that.

23:58.021 --> 24:01.191
We're BFFs. I'm actually Claire's plus-one
on her family vacay.

24:01.191 --> 24:03.694
You know, usually, I hate long flights

24:03.694 --> 24:07.739
but when she said her dad has the company
jet, I was like, "Yes, please."

24:08.699 --> 24:10.534
So is, like, customs the same?

24:11.118 --> 24:12.578
What?

24:12.578 --> 24:14.121
On a private jet, is the like--

24:14.830 --> 24:16.456
Like the security and stuff the same?

24:16.456 --> 24:18.876
I mean, there's a guy who looks
through your bags and stuff

24:18.876 --> 24:20.752
but it's not as bad as a regular airport.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.338
Those body scanners though.
-You know whoever's behind there

24:23.338 --> 24:25.257
is a total pervert.
-Total perv.

24:25.257 --> 24:28.093
This has actually been really fun.
We should hang out later.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.929
What's your number?
-I lost my phone.

24:31.597 --> 24:34.933
Fucking kill me.
I would perish. I'm so sorry.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.059
What's your handle?

24:37.436 --> 24:40.022
Your socials. Your gram. Tiktok.

24:40.022 --> 24:43.025
Snap.
Here, just put it in. It'll be easier.

24:43.692 --> 24:46.320
My dad says we have a table.
-Good.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.072
I would hate not having a phone.
-Remember when I lost mine for a week?

24:52.367 --> 24:53.368
Thank you.

24:54.578 --> 24:57.873
OMFG. Claire, look it. It's hilarious.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.711
I knew it.
You are so a crazy meme account.

25:02.711 --> 25:05.547
I should've known from the shirt.
You have like 10k followers.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.674
You're basically a celebrity.
You should follow us.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.802
I have a great idea.
We should get drunk later.

25:10.802 --> 25:14.097
The drinking age is like eight here.
We'll have a blast.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.308
Well, we have to go, but we'll talk later?

25:18.018 --> 25:19.353
<i>Adios.</i>
-Bye.

25:20.479 --> 25:23.899
So quesadillas or margaritas?
-She's cool.

25:23.899 --> 25:25.025
I know.

26:06.108 --> 26:08.861
This is good. It's a perfect sight line.

26:09.403 --> 26:12.573
I usually work with my own team.
But this time, I'm using Guillermo's.

26:13.365 --> 26:17.828
I need someone I can fully trust.
You'll hide here with a walkie.

26:20.998 --> 26:23.917
The attack's tomorrow. One o'clock.

26:25.377 --> 26:26.378
What?

26:29.464 --> 26:30.465
Do you still want in?

26:35.220 --> 26:36.054
Yes.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.309
<i>Where's my agreement?</i>
-You got a time for me?

26:40.309 --> 26:44.188
Yes, but you aren't getting shit without
my immunity spelled out in writing.

26:44.188 --> 26:47.274
I'm with ya. All right, check your inbox.

26:52.821 --> 26:53.822
We good?

27:00.204 --> 27:01.663
It's tomorrow. One o'clock.

27:01.663 --> 27:05.209
Tomorrow? Jesus Christ, Margot,
what are you talking about tomorrow?

27:05.209 --> 27:07.878
<i>No way, I need a longer runway than that.</i>

27:07.878 --> 27:10.255
<i>It's in motion.
You have to take him tomorrow.</i>

27:10.255 --> 27:13.425
There's explosives involved. He told me
no one gets hurt, but I'm not convinced.

27:13.425 --> 27:15.761
Margot, listen. I don't just send in
guns like that, all right?

27:15.761 --> 27:17.721
We've gotta coordinate with the locals,
you know that.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.556
<i>You're the one who wanted this aboveboard.</i>

27:19.556 --> 27:23.018
You do what you have to do.
But don't fuck me when we're this close.

27:36.573 --> 27:39.117
You've got your vehicle for access
at the entry gate?

27:39.660 --> 27:42.287
Yep.
-Any security in sight?

27:43.413 --> 27:45.832
Nothing beyond the main gates. It's clean.

27:47.167 --> 27:50.754
Nothing's changed on your side,
no last-minute changes to the schedule?

27:51.380 --> 27:54.341
Nope.
-And no changes to the target?

27:55.801 --> 27:57.970
Nope. All on track.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.806
You have enough guys?

28:00.806 --> 28:02.558
I'm good once inside.

28:02.558 --> 28:05.727
I could do with two more on the outside
to keep tabs,

28:05.727 --> 28:07.896
feed information about who's coming
and going.

28:08.730 --> 28:12.526
Nothing less than the survival
of my ancestral land is at stake here.

28:13.235 --> 28:16.029
Aggressive action against
the building alone does nothing.

28:16.947 --> 28:20.200
It's an insurance job,
and then they're on their merry way.

28:21.994 --> 28:26.039
You saw what happened in Virid.
Threatening their families and children.

28:27.708 --> 28:28.959
They don't give a shit.

28:31.837 --> 28:32.921
This is the only way.

28:38.594 --> 28:39.928
Do me a favor.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.223
Don't tell Isela until I'm gone.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.185
I don't think she'll agree.

29:32.356 --> 29:33.982
We can't stop the bleeding.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.362
We're hanging by a wire.

29:43.951 --> 29:48.413
Hey. I spoke to Guillermo. It's done.

29:50.582 --> 29:51.583
Great.

29:54.336 --> 29:55.546
Where's Charlie?

29:56.129 --> 29:57.506
I haven't seen him.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.143
I'm okay.

30:10.936 --> 30:11.937
I'm okay.

30:12.938 --> 30:13.939
I'm okay.

30:15.274 --> 30:16.275
I'm okay.

30:17.442 --> 30:18.443
I'm okay.

30:19.403 --> 30:20.404
I'm okay.

30:21.530 --> 30:22.531
I'm okay.

30:40.007 --> 30:41.425
I'm okay.

30:42.301 --> 30:43.302
I'm okay.

30:45.137 --> 30:46.138
I'm okay.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.074
It's tomorrow.

31:14.291 --> 31:18.795
Richard gets taken into custody.
And we're granted immunity.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.681
Aren't you gonna ask me how I feel?

31:36.313 --> 31:38.941
Well, I feel like shit. Thanks for asking.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.697
Turning in someone I believe in.

31:46.532 --> 31:50.327
Betraying a cause I care deeply about.
So, yeah, I feel like shit.

31:54.498 --> 31:59.920
So what's this plan you've been talking
to Charlie about? You care to share?

32:07.094 --> 32:08.136
Hey.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.436
Are we over?

34:07.631 --> 34:12.135
Look who's finally exercising!

34:12.135 --> 34:13.219
Memo...

34:13.219 --> 34:15.054
You only come on Tuesdays.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.014
Who let you in?

34:17.558 --> 34:20.268
Have you come to apologize?

34:22.228 --> 34:24.481
No.

34:36.076 --> 34:39.496
And who's your little friend?
The little goofball?

34:39.496 --> 34:41.123
He's the best in the world.

34:41.123 --> 34:44.293
Is he here to protect you from me?

34:44.293 --> 34:45.960
Do I want one too?

34:46.879 --> 34:49.172
I guess funny runs in the family, huh?

34:49.922 --> 34:52.134
You'll need to get someone.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.344
With all your development,

34:54.344 --> 34:56.304
comes greater power and more enemies.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.348
Does this mean you're finally

34:58.348 --> 35:01.226
accepting the inevitable?

35:04.062 --> 35:05.314
Hooray for the good guys.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.108
I came for my check today

35:08.108 --> 35:11.236
since it seems you won't
be here tomorrow

35:11.236 --> 35:12.571
or the weekend.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.406
No.

35:17.868 --> 35:20.162
No, we won't be here.

35:21.747 --> 35:23.332
And just so you know,

35:23.332 --> 35:27.211
after the tantrum you still insist
you didn't do at our Virid conference,

35:27.211 --> 35:33.133
all our investors will be safely
present by video hook-up.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.928
Your theatrics exhaust us all.

35:37.554 --> 35:40.224
Give me my check.

35:45.938 --> 35:48.565
I suppose I could cut your
check a day early.

35:48.565 --> 35:50.025
Very nice of you.

35:50.692 --> 35:54.655
Guillermo, you're impossible.

36:00.035 --> 36:04.540
We've got the Governor.
We've got deputies on our side.

36:08.752 --> 36:11.964
Nice to meet you.

36:36.321 --> 36:38.574
<i>Buenas tardes.</i> May I get you something?

36:38.574 --> 36:40.951
Yeah, can I see a menu?
-Certainly.

36:50.377 --> 36:51.670
Please, take your time.

36:54.506 --> 36:56.675
Can I just get a hamburger?

36:57.176 --> 36:59.094
Room number?
-208.

36:59.094 --> 37:00.721
208. Right away.

37:00.721 --> 37:03.390
And a Coke?
-Coke.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.184
And some French fries?

37:05.684 --> 37:07.186
French fries.
-And a salad.

37:07.186 --> 37:09.521
A salad with dressing and some--
-Salad.

37:09.521 --> 37:10.981
Some chicken fingers.

37:12.733 --> 37:16.069
And a sandwich.
-Sandwich. You have any guests coming?

37:16.069 --> 37:19.865
Yeah. Maybe. Not sure.
They said they'd maybe come later.

37:20.616 --> 37:21.617
Okay. Of course.

37:22.326 --> 37:26.246
And something sweet.
Like ice cream or something. That's it.

37:26.246 --> 37:27.331
Of course. Thank you.

37:37.216 --> 37:41.303
Oh, my God. They'll eat anything.
They're like rats.

37:41.303 --> 37:44.848
Let's see if he likes-- Hot dog. Hot dog.

37:45.516 --> 37:47.309
Get it.
-Dan, Stop.

37:47.309 --> 37:50.187
Maybe it likes potato chips. Too slow.

37:50.187 --> 37:51.647
That's a good hot dog.

37:51.647 --> 37:54.316
Honey, why?
-Sorry, bird. You dum-dum.

38:30.477 --> 38:31.520
You good?

38:34.690 --> 38:35.691
Yeah.

39:02.217 --> 39:03.385
You know where to meet me.

39:08.265 --> 39:09.266
No casualties.

39:34.291 --> 39:35.584
Can I come up?

39:37.085 --> 39:38.086
Sure.

40:08.617 --> 40:10.410
Started reading your mom's books again?

40:13.330 --> 40:15.541
Got a copy of this
for your mother years ago.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.920
She was in a sad place.

40:21.797 --> 40:22.798
Here.

40:24.466 --> 40:26.468
I underlined this part for her. Here.

40:31.932 --> 40:35.894
"Nothing that I wrote yesterday is true.
Only this remains:

40:35.894 --> 40:39.439
Reality interests me in as much
as it is plastic,

40:39.439 --> 40:43.443
and I care infinitely more
for what may be than for what has been."

40:45.737 --> 40:46.989
Keep going.

40:47.781 --> 40:51.243
"I lean with a fearful attraction over
the depths of each creature's soul

40:51.243 --> 40:55.122
and weep for all that lies atrophied under
the heavy lid of custom and morality."

41:03.297 --> 41:04.381
Did Silvia die?

41:06.842 --> 41:07.843
Yes.

41:11.805 --> 41:13.015
Why did she have to die?

41:16.643 --> 41:18.645
That's not an easy question to answer.

41:20.105 --> 41:21.815
How are we gonna find Dina?

41:24.401 --> 41:25.527
She's gone too.

41:30.824 --> 41:32.201
I thought you knew everything.

41:43.712 --> 41:45.923
I feel like I'm losing both my families.

41:47.799 --> 41:53.514
You, Mom, Dina. And Casa Roja.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.494
<i>Buenos dias.</i>
-<i>Buenos dias.</i>

42:59.454 --> 43:00.581
I'm in position.

43:05.377 --> 43:07.087
<i>Is there any activity at the gate?</i>

43:07.087 --> 43:08.172
I s--

43:11.925 --> 43:13.093
<i>Margot, am I clear?</i>

43:15.429 --> 43:16.430
<i>Margot!</i>

43:17.514 --> 43:18.682
Yes, it's clear.

43:52.799 --> 43:53.967
Richard Beaumont!

43:58.263 --> 43:59.431
Richard Beaumont.

44:24.498 --> 44:28.627
<i>Margot. I only told one person
that something was happening today.</i>

44:29.795 --> 44:30.796
You.

44:32.631 --> 44:34.383
<i>You heartless bitch.</i>

44:34.883 --> 44:38.929
<i>The world is dying.
You understood that once.</i>

44:40.013 --> 44:42.140
And only harsh measures can save us.

44:44.351 --> 44:45.435
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

46:20.739 --> 46:21.990
We got her.

46:25.536 --> 46:26.954
I'm at the target.

46:26.954 --> 46:32.960
<i>Everything's set as planned.
I squared away one last detail.</i>

46:34.127 --> 46:35.337
Sounds good.
