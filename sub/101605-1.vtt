WEBVTT

01:24.283 --> 01:27.219
He was
a preacher, my dad.

01:29.221 --> 01:30.757
Mom was a gardener.

01:32.924 --> 01:35.462
My baby sister, the dreamer.

01:37.629 --> 01:38.664
We were a family.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.668
Driving with a carload of books

01:43.701 --> 01:45.504
through towns that
lost their name.

01:50.843 --> 01:53.646
That car was our life back then.

01:58.483 --> 02:00.319
It started with headaches.

02:03.421 --> 02:04.456
Neighborhoods

02:05.724 --> 02:06.659
disappeared

02:07.525 --> 02:08.360
overnight.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.205
People ran as if you
could run from the sky.

02:22.807 --> 02:24.376
When the nights froze over,

02:26.277 --> 02:29.181
our parents kept us
safe in that car.

02:33.885 --> 02:37.524
Taught us who we
were supposed to be.

03:51.462 --> 03:53.233
Is it plugged in?

04:59.430 --> 05:04.437
Daddy said
"beware of false prophets

05:04.470 --> 05:06.873
that come to you in
sheep's clothing."

05:21.519 --> 05:24.456
Security
breach, gate 14.

05:41.173 --> 05:43.007
Did you see what
he looked like?

06:15.774 --> 06:16.975
May I see your weapon?

06:36.194 --> 06:37.663
Is this what he wants?

06:37.696 --> 06:38.931
Protocol.

07:17.536 --> 07:18.670
Go get 'em, boys.

07:48.065 --> 07:51.002
We need to get
you in the ground.

08:52.663 --> 08:54.165
You said never again.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.671
It's just protection.

09:15.653 --> 09:16.254
Hey.

09:19.691 --> 09:22.762
You're not like them and
you bring that gun here.

09:23.894 --> 09:25.331
Scavengers on the road.

09:26.664 --> 09:27.766
They're just people.

09:29.999 --> 09:44.649
Like you and me.

09:44.649 --> 09:45.918
I had that dream again.

09:47.418 --> 09:48.687
At the ocean.

09:53.024 --> 09:54.793
Over and over.

09:58.429 --> 09:59.664
Don't leave me.

10:03.434 --> 10:04.669
Don't leave me.

10:06.904 --> 10:09.007
I don't wanna lose you
back to that world.

10:16.947 --> 10:19.384
You're never gonna lose me.

10:48.913 --> 10:50.816
How dare you!

11:14.004 --> 11:15.441
It's him.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.309
He's traveling with an
illegal mutt, mixed race.

11:23.481 --> 11:25.784
They stole five
gallons and a handgun.

11:28.452 --> 11:29.422
Bring him to him.

11:30.989 --> 11:31.824
The girl?

11:32.823 --> 11:33.858
Cute.

11:35.793 --> 11:37.129
What are the numbers for today?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.298
1.6 terawatts, core is stable.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.805
I want it doubled
by next week.

11:51.076 --> 11:53.278
Your salt bath will
be ready in 20 minutes.

12:17.969 --> 12:19.004
It's just a tremor.

12:32.918 --> 12:33.519
Careful.

13:04.216 --> 13:05.183
Daddy long legs?

13:06.985 --> 13:08.486
Aren't they...

13:10.956 --> 13:11.791
Extinct.

13:28.606 --> 13:32.812
Do not neglect to show
hospitality to strangers.

13:34.078 --> 13:37.415
Some have entertained
angels unawares.

13:59.136 --> 14:00.572
Love is patient!

14:02.974 --> 14:04.076
Love is kind!

14:05.677 --> 14:07.346
It does not envy!

14:08.947 --> 14:10.381
It does not boast!

14:11.582 --> 14:14.218
It is proud!

14:14.251 --> 14:16.187
It is not proud!

14:19.256 --> 14:20.491
He himself will be saved!

14:22.192 --> 14:27.131
That your bodies are
temples of the holy spirit!

14:27.164 --> 14:30.101
Who is it, you,

14:30.134 --> 14:32.605
whom you have received from God.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.274
You!

14:38.143 --> 14:41.180
He himself will be saved.

14:43.248 --> 14:46.018
Only as one escaping
through the flames.

14:52.624 --> 14:54.058
Corinthians 3:15.

14:58.062 --> 15:00.032
Have you heard
the word of God?

15:01.365 --> 15:02.201
I've read it.

15:11.076 --> 15:11.976
Where you goin'?

15:16.047 --> 15:17.983
I'm an onlookin' man.

15:18.015 --> 15:20.519
My travel snapped.

15:22.754 --> 15:24.423
You're the only
humans I've seen.

15:51.015 --> 15:52.450
For a trade, I can fix it.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.086
Hm?

15:54.119 --> 15:54.987
Oh!

15:56.120 --> 15:57.722
Wine from the south.

15:57.755 --> 16:00.125
Wine from the south!

16:00.158 --> 16:01.625
Okay, think, think. Where is it?

16:01.658 --> 16:04.996
Oh, where did I put it? Um,
okay, I think it's here.

16:05.029 --> 16:07.432
Ah, no, it's in this
other one over here.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.234
Don't go away.

16:11.436 --> 16:14.538
Here it is.

16:36.293 --> 16:37.596
I don't judge.

16:39.129 --> 16:40.432
The Lord don't judge,

16:42.133 --> 16:46.772
if you're a Christian,
Muslim or Jew.

16:49.441 --> 16:50.309
I'm a sinner.

16:55.113 --> 16:56.782
What about lady here?

16:56.815 --> 16:58.017
Is she a sinner too?

17:00.118 --> 17:01.153
Saint.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.199
Why are you going north?

17:14.231 --> 17:15.067
Water.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.038
You got a map?

17:20.872 --> 17:22.340
I got a feeling.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.760
Bad luck carrying a weapon.

17:47.865 --> 17:50.234
Nothing good come from it.

17:52.269 --> 17:53.271
Goodnight.

18:26.503 --> 18:29.440
Don't cut
yourself.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.355
Are
we gonna be okay?

18:43.387 --> 18:44.188
Yeah.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.192
Once we get past the
city, we'll be safe.

18:59.671 --> 19:04.308
Even in our sleep, pain,
which cannot forget,

19:05.076 --> 19:07.613
falls drop by drop
upon the heart.

19:11.281 --> 19:14.485
Until, in our own despair,

19:14.519 --> 19:17.722
against our will comes wisdom

19:18.390 --> 19:21.293
through the awful grace of God.

19:39.943 --> 19:41.712
Come
to sleep, baby.

19:43.647 --> 19:44.482
I can't.

19:50.821 --> 19:51.656
Let's go.

20:45.576 --> 20:46.510
Who are you with?

20:49.579 --> 20:50.414
Who are you with?

20:53.317 --> 20:54.318
He's a child!

21:17.442 --> 21:18.277
I'm sorry.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.421
How old are you?

21:30.387 --> 21:31.423
14.

21:35.093 --> 21:36.995
Well,
where's your family?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.075
Love is patient.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.513
Love is kind.

22:15.098 --> 22:16.701
It's too risky.

22:16.733 --> 22:17.903
She's got no one.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.459
Very good!

22:41.491 --> 22:43.827
I have hunger.

22:43.861 --> 22:45.730
I have hunger.

22:45.762 --> 22:47.698
Very good!

22:52.502 --> 22:55.406
So good!

22:55.440 --> 22:58.076
Let's try "we have hunger."

23:03.181 --> 23:07.419
Very good, you are on a
roll.

23:07.451 --> 23:08.854
The Spanish word...

23:23.534 --> 23:24.636
Feel good?

23:27.771 --> 23:28.673
We ready?

23:29.773 --> 23:32.643
Boots on the ground
on one of them.

23:34.244 --> 23:37.748
The boys will be
happy to have him back.

24:11.615 --> 24:15.920
He's awake!

24:15.952 --> 24:17.989
Mister!

24:40.845 --> 24:44.548
No, you were not authorized
to drop a smoke bomb.

24:44.582 --> 24:47.118
- Visibility is at 30%.
- She was in the way!

24:47.151 --> 24:49.520
I decided to grab her first.

24:49.554 --> 24:51.089
- She was-
- You decided!

24:52.155 --> 24:54.592
Grab the girl.

24:59.630 --> 25:00.532
We'll get him.

25:21.318 --> 25:23.555
Like the eyes of my papa.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.598
Open it!

25:34.632 --> 25:35.267
It can't see.

25:59.056 --> 26:01.593
Me and the boys missed you.

26:15.905 --> 26:17.608
What did you do?

26:22.779 --> 26:23.882
I tried to kill him.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.839
You may get your revenge.

26:49.272 --> 26:51.009
But not without a price.

26:53.076 --> 26:54.244
This is my home.

26:55.145 --> 26:56.615
I'm staying here.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.920
Chinese evergreen elm.

27:05.355 --> 27:07.224
They stay green all year.

27:08.759 --> 27:09.361
Dead now.

27:12.028 --> 27:13.030
It's still useful.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.982
You can't be on
the fence in life.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.083
Or in killing.

27:35.152 --> 27:36.755
You gotta own it.

28:34.912 --> 28:36.181
Imagine that.

28:37.882 --> 28:38.917
Once a captain.

28:41.018 --> 28:42.353
Now look at you.

29:27.463 --> 29:30.801
You're
never gonna lose me.

29:59.596 --> 30:03.867
It's a surprise! Patience
is the mother of invention.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.470
- Good fortune.
- Good fortune.

30:12.108 --> 30:15.946
Charlie, don't be a fuckin'
idiot! This is the plan!

30:15.980 --> 30:17.280
What, what, what's the date?

30:17.314 --> 30:18.481
One week from the day, sir.

30:18.515 --> 30:21.853
One week from today, Charlie.
Now get your shit together.

30:24.954 --> 30:25.589
Riley?

30:28.057 --> 30:29.160
How long we been here?

30:37.268 --> 30:38.068
Too long.

30:44.674 --> 30:46.009
We left the food.

30:59.656 --> 31:01.425
What's
gonna happen to her?

31:02.992 --> 31:05.061
She'll be okay.

31:05.095 --> 31:06.163
It's me they want.

31:10.334 --> 31:11.936
Where are we going?

31:15.538 --> 31:17.040
Back.

31:32.221 --> 31:34.291
The one you killed, you knew?

31:45.702 --> 31:47.004
He has a witch.

31:49.073 --> 31:49.641
I know.

31:55.011 --> 31:56.379
He is a monster.

33:13.057 --> 33:18.062
Mom said nature
will return, but not us.

33:20.130 --> 33:24.402
The only humans left would
be the mystics of the canyon.

35:04.668 --> 35:08.206
We've got the girl, but
the man is still alive.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.151
Burn him.

35:55.418 --> 35:56.721
Do you know where you are?

35:59.822 --> 36:01.491
Nod. Yes or no.

36:01.525 --> 36:02.360
Do it now.

36:05.262 --> 36:07.331
You're on private property.

36:07.364 --> 36:08.766
One of the last of its kind.

36:10.967 --> 36:12.769
Your friend,

36:16.273 --> 36:18.375
used to be my friend.

36:18.407 --> 36:19.909
Did you know that?

36:19.943 --> 36:21.312
He's not like you.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.682
He used to work for me.

36:24.715 --> 36:25.783
And now he's free.

36:29.686 --> 36:32.789
Have you ever
seen one of these?

37:11.527 --> 37:13.363
Should've taken the main road.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.335
She's
beautiful, I must say.

37:53.637 --> 37:57.041
Lover boy's
alive, coming this way.

37:57.074 --> 38:00.478
We can't locate him on the
map, so he must have a shield.

38:03.347 --> 38:04.849
I think he's coming
to rescue her.

38:05.782 --> 38:06.884
Good.

38:06.916 --> 38:08.885
Send another drone immediately.

38:08.918 --> 38:11.355
Already taken care of.

38:11.387 --> 38:14.324
One tracker made the
trip just this morning.

38:14.358 --> 38:14.992
Make sure.

38:16.559 --> 38:19.029
Her skin, it's unlike
anything I've ever seen.

38:22.431 --> 38:23.466
Riley?

38:24.934 --> 38:25.769
She's fertile.

38:45.688 --> 38:47.924
Mister.

38:50.092 --> 38:50.927
Mister.

38:54.398 --> 38:55.432
Mister.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.425
Let's go.

39:35.905 --> 39:38.842
What happened to
your hand, mister?

40:01.197 --> 40:03.466
Someone
always profits

40:03.500 --> 40:05.469
off the fear in people's hearts.

41:20.976 --> 41:23.580
What have you done?

41:29.652 --> 41:30.487
Scavenger.

41:34.690 --> 41:36.859
What have you done?

41:36.893 --> 41:38.695
How dare you!

41:38.728 --> 41:40.030
A thief!

41:40.063 --> 41:42.599
A scavenger.

41:42.632 --> 41:43.733
A scavenger.

41:43.766 --> 41:45.568
What have you done?

41:45.601 --> 41:48.304
Who do
you think you are?

42:09.759 --> 42:10.827
I can smell it.

42:13.096 --> 42:15.132
The gas pumping
through these walls.

42:16.599 --> 42:18.701
Who'd have thought
we'd find so much more?

42:20.235 --> 42:21.538
There's always more.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.010
What are the numbers?

42:27.043 --> 42:28.711
34 terawatts.

42:29.778 --> 42:30.947
Mm!

42:30.981 --> 42:32.916
You have
a meeting, Riley.

42:32.949 --> 42:33.784
I gotta go.

43:21.731 --> 43:24.368
I've got a special
upload for you.

43:51.427 --> 43:53.896
Goodnight, mister.

44:33.302 --> 44:36.172
What have you done?

44:53.422 --> 44:56.859
Katie said
nothing could kill us.

44:57.927 --> 45:00.731
We were meant for so much more.

46:31.588 --> 46:32.823
"Ah!"

46:34.923 --> 46:35.559
Ah.

46:40.163 --> 46:41.931
Francisco Flores.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.233
Congratulations,
you've been selected.

46:47.903 --> 46:50.807
How about a song?

46:53.342 --> 46:55.011
Not
gonna sing anymore.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.115
When we get there...

47:36.385 --> 47:37.588
You see her...

47:39.655 --> 47:40.891
You run.

47:42.090 --> 47:43.192
You run for your life.

47:44.661 --> 47:45.494
I'll kill her.

47:47.496 --> 47:48.898
She changed my pa.

47:56.972 --> 48:01.010
My pa drove our
car off the road.

48:05.081 --> 48:05.916
It was me,

48:07.583 --> 48:09.952
my little sister, Katie,

48:11.320 --> 48:12.188
my mom.

48:14.990 --> 48:16.259
We'd wake up to this sound.

48:29.706 --> 48:31.541
Like a train comin'.

48:33.742 --> 48:35.511
The rumble strip.

48:36.478 --> 48:37.313
Rumble.

48:40.449 --> 48:42.952
Four grooves carved in cement.

48:44.487 --> 48:45.989
To keep you awake,

48:47.690 --> 48:48.625
Daddy died.

48:55.231 --> 48:56.466
Everybody died.

49:03.572 --> 49:05.975
I don't know what
they done to me.

49:08.777 --> 49:10.112
I've gotta find her.

49:12.382 --> 49:13.383
I've gotta find her.

49:15.717 --> 49:18.454
She's my....

49:19.789 --> 49:21.325
Rumble strip.

50:03.666 --> 50:06.036
The tremors
are increasing.

50:07.170 --> 50:09.005
Charlie will want
an explanation.

50:09.739 --> 50:10.574
Numbers?

50:11.706 --> 50:14.411
15 terawatts
just this morning.

50:14.443 --> 50:15.277
I want more.

50:17.847 --> 50:20.050
Where will I sit at the party?

50:26.688 --> 50:27.790
Can I sit next to you?

50:30.092 --> 50:32.128
The table is for
shareholders, Carmen.

50:35.864 --> 50:37.133
You know I'm all yours.

50:43.239 --> 50:44.141
Right, Riley?

50:45.608 --> 50:47.610
I know, baby.

50:47.643 --> 50:49.045
You're my girl.

52:12.628 --> 52:13.730
Can we rest?

52:14.931 --> 52:16.298
Just keep going.

54:00.068 --> 54:00.804
Mister!

54:23.492 --> 54:24.327
Mister.

54:28.597 --> 54:29.432
Mister!

54:40.710 --> 54:44.813
Defector
2285 has been terminated.

54:53.722 --> 54:55.090
Yeah, Charlie.

54:55.123 --> 54:57.059
Jacob is getting anxious.

54:58.126 --> 55:02.030
How the fuck do I calm him
down when I'm in the dark?

55:02.063 --> 55:03.966
It is double what we agreed on.

55:05.101 --> 55:07.436
In two days,
this will be done.

55:07.469 --> 55:10.339
You understand the position
you're putting me in?

55:10.373 --> 55:12.342
Trust me, in two
days you're gonna sign

55:12.375 --> 55:14.543
the sweetest deal of your life.

55:14.577 --> 55:17.480
I don't trust shit.

55:17.512 --> 55:20.016
The only reason I'm in
this is because Jacob said

55:20.048 --> 55:21.583
it was gonna be easy money.

55:21.617 --> 55:23.885
There's nothin' easy about you.

55:23.918 --> 55:25.821
I'll see you in two days.

55:25.855 --> 55:29.358
If I ain't happy,
nobody's gonna be happy.

55:30.626 --> 55:32.429
And you want me happy.

55:47.409 --> 55:48.510
Look in the furnace.

55:50.646 --> 55:53.682
You can eat what you
want, but not the fish.

55:53.715 --> 55:54.851
Only we can eat it.

55:56.050 --> 55:56.885
It's poisoned.

56:01.056 --> 56:02.057
You escape the fort?

56:03.192 --> 56:04.159
On our way.

56:06.762 --> 56:08.398
Well, you must hate living.

56:15.570 --> 56:18.942
He needs knowing hand,
to cut the poison,

56:22.210 --> 56:23.413
or else he'll die.

56:26.215 --> 56:28.017
Felicia will look.

56:28.050 --> 56:29.752
In return...

56:29.784 --> 56:30.619
What?

56:33.722 --> 56:34.557
The weapon.

56:42.565 --> 56:43.432
Thirsty, huh?

56:48.804 --> 56:51.072
We've been drinking
the runoff all summer.

56:51.106 --> 56:53.176
There's plenty if you
can risk the RCAs.

56:54.943 --> 56:56.211
RC?

56:56.244 --> 56:58.013
Robot controlled aircraft.

56:59.514 --> 57:02.451
Death from above.

57:02.485 --> 57:05.422
Somewhere, vigilantes
sitting in their board rooms,

57:06.489 --> 57:08.557
wearing silicon dining-it style.

57:09.992 --> 57:10.960
Somewhere.

57:12.561 --> 57:13.163
Found it.

57:20.202 --> 57:21.938
I say fuck 'em all.

57:23.105 --> 57:24.907
We're on our own.

58:31.239 --> 58:32.708
He's lucky it was poison.

58:38.581 --> 58:40.115
We cannot heal an altered brain.

58:58.701 --> 59:00.001
Stay.

59:00.034 --> 59:01.270
You're not ready to stand.

59:03.672 --> 59:04.574
Where's the gun?

59:05.708 --> 59:06.608
We have it safe.

59:12.146 --> 59:12.981
We?

59:16.751 --> 59:17.820
This is San Juan.

59:20.688 --> 59:21.623
Or Sacramento.

59:22.858 --> 59:24.160
Don't really know anymore.

59:26.061 --> 59:26.863
North.

59:28.364 --> 59:30.567
We're the mystics of the canyon.

59:38.407 --> 59:39.842
The girl.

59:39.875 --> 59:41.110
She's safe.

59:41.143 --> 59:45.146
"Sky at different
times of the night."

59:45.179 --> 59:46.181
Rest now.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.665
She'll be very useful.

01:00:04.733 --> 01:00:05.368
You're sick.

01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:07.737
That's why you like me.

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:14.811
Can you give me a child?

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.080
Have you ever seen
a woman fertile?

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.817
The center of the
Earth is hollow.

01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:24.386
47 terawatts extracted.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.722
I broke the laws
of physics for you.

01:00:27.755 --> 01:00:28.690
Can she do that?

01:00:35.063 --> 01:00:35.897
Carmen.

01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.701
This is the future.

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:40.802
She's our secret,
no one will know.

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:45.942
Don't you want
a future with me?

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.312
You're my girl.

01:00:55.983 --> 01:00:57.186
Go get ready.

01:01:32.387 --> 01:01:33.856
Breathe deep.

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:39.695
Before.

01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:50.405
I was just a boy.

01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:53.241
Scavenging.

01:01:56.378 --> 01:01:57.713
Riley found me.

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:01.983
Trained me to be a soldier.

01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:07.923
He had a scientist
develop mind control.

01:02:11.393 --> 01:02:13.762
I watched masses of people.

01:02:16.898 --> 01:02:18.835
- Their souls broken.
- Help us.

01:02:20.969 --> 01:02:22.871
Help us!

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:26.075
Until I
couldn't take anymore.

01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:36.885
- Scavenger.
- What have you done?

01:02:36.918 --> 01:02:41.856
- Scavenger.
- What have you done?

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:43.125
Don't judge me!

01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:46.362
- Don't!
- What have you done?

01:02:47.295 --> 01:02:48.931
- Help us.
- Help us.

01:02:50.065 --> 01:02:51.934
Scavenger.

01:02:57.905 --> 01:03:00.576
Scavenger.

01:03:00.608 --> 01:03:03.077
- Help!
- What have you done?

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.813
Should
I have stayed?

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:05.848
Help us!

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.115
Help us.

01:03:07.148 --> 01:03:09.251
What're you staring at?

01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:15.457
Scavenger.

01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:17.559
What've you done?

01:03:18.893 --> 01:03:21.863
- Scavenger.
- What have you done?

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:25.233
- Help us.
- Help us!

01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:28.804
- He's staring.
- What're you staring at?

01:03:31.873 --> 01:03:34.175
What are
you staring at?

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:37.346
- What did you do?
- What're you staring at?

01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:39.514
- I'm sorry.
- Staring at me.

01:03:39.547 --> 01:03:41.082
Staring at me.

01:03:41.115 --> 01:03:43.085
Please forgive me.

01:03:43.117 --> 01:03:45.520
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:49.224
Scavenger.

01:03:49.257 --> 01:03:50.826
What have you done?

01:03:54.996 --> 01:03:56.998
What're
you staring at?

01:03:57.032 --> 01:03:57.867
Scavenger.

01:04:22.523 --> 01:04:24.425
And now?

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:26.261
I have
to get somebody.

01:04:30.965 --> 01:04:34.002
The girl?

01:04:43.144 --> 01:04:45.047
You'll reach the
sands by nightfall.

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:09.203
Thank you.

01:05:09.237 --> 01:05:11.941
You have a warrior's spirit.

01:05:38.032 --> 01:05:39.701
- I
- looked and behold.

01:05:41.769 --> 01:05:42.938
A pale horse.

01:05:45.306 --> 01:05:47.075
The rider's name was death.

01:05:50.045 --> 01:05:52.114
And hell followed with him.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.175
Compute?

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:22.411
Yes, Riley?

01:06:23.577 --> 01:06:24.413
Progress.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.682
Hard drive online.

01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:30.585
Six terabytes of
empty space available.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.028
Guests are arriving.

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:40.262
I'll be there in a moment.

01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:00.449
Upload complete.

01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:05.054
Can you hear me?

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:25.441
I've got some very
big plans for you.

01:07:34.148 --> 01:07:35.150
You're gonna be my girl.

01:08:05.246 --> 01:08:08.451
Defector 2285 with unknown
entering the premises.

01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:11.186
Terminate
at all costs.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.189
Breach.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.523
Breach.

01:08:48.555 --> 01:08:50.893
Intruder in the east hallway.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:51.894
Copy.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:02.403
Come on.

01:09:58.693 --> 01:09:59.695
Six months.

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.530
Time flies with no competition.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:10.706
SPHERECorp is
strong, my friends.

01:10:11.773 --> 01:10:14.210
Prisons making record profits.

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:16.778
We've successfully privatized

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:18.913
the last source of
natural running water.

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:22.351
With your finance and resources,

01:10:24.485 --> 01:10:27.355
I've had a major
breakthrough in my research.

01:10:31.025 --> 01:10:35.296
I've extracted a
full 47 terawatts

01:10:35.329 --> 01:10:37.565
of molten energy from the core.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:42.637
What's the deal?

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:49.278
Take a look at these.

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:51.447
Please.

01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:18.339
Hey!

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.469
It's self-sustaining?

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.938
For all time.

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:52.340
Who gave you the
authority to dig so deep?

01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:53.875
Me.

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:56.978
Is this safe?

01:11:57.011 --> 01:11:58.080
I've actually
replaced the core

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.316
with something
far more suitable.

01:12:02.449 --> 01:12:04.686
The sweetest deal of my life.

01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:09.557
We all get 5%, you get the rest?

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.094
Yeah.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:15.664
47 terawatts is an
enormous amount of capital.

01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:18.534
Jacob and I gave you the
power to make this happen.

01:12:19.701 --> 01:12:20.536
Gentlemen.

01:12:22.703 --> 01:12:24.105
You won't have enough room

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:26.975
for the extra zeros
on your ledgers.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.011
I'm intrigued.

01:12:32.146 --> 01:12:33.715
I'm intrigued.

01:12:33.747 --> 01:12:35.616
Why should we keep
our investment with you?

01:12:35.649 --> 01:12:37.051
You've blown every deadline.

01:12:38.552 --> 01:12:39.488
I want more.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:45.427
You think I'm gonna
wipe your ass for 5%?

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.395
I don't work for you.

01:12:49.596 --> 01:12:51.733
Jacob and I are out.

01:12:51.765 --> 01:12:54.369
You take the core, kiss my ass.

01:12:55.869 --> 01:12:57.939
Where can you go without water?

01:13:02.777 --> 01:13:03.845
I have options.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:13.654
You!

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:17.126
That's one point
added to every man.

01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:23.030
You have a choice.

01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:34.443
Hey, stop!

01:13:57.731 --> 01:13:59.467
We're all in.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:00.668
Yeah.

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:01.537
Excellent.

01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:07.775
It's just a tremor.

01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:33.761
Come
here.

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.211
Meeting's over.

01:16:55.409 --> 01:16:57.645
This your new girl, huh?

01:17:00.414 --> 01:17:01.817
She's my future.

01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:09.358
Carmen, don't!

01:17:32.913 --> 01:17:33.748
My

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:35.751
future.

01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:21.896
Don't leave me.

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:26.400
Don't leave me.

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:40.715
Daddy said "the
meek shall inherit the Earth."

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.422
This is all mine, Dad.
