FILM 14

01:08.760 --> 01:12.240
<i>Who was it that told me that any truth</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:15.880
<i>has to be tested… by fire?</i>

02:07.320 --> 02:10.080
Have you tried starting your day
some other way?

02:10.160 --> 02:12.160
I have. It’s not for me.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.240
Is the shower free? Yes! I’m the shower’s liberator!

02:42.840 --> 02:44.240
Are you okay?

02:50.720 --> 02:51.840
Yes!

02:54.400 --> 02:55.640
Yes, I understand.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.440
Rodion…

03:07.440 --> 03:08.720
we need to go.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.480
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

03:25.480 --> 03:26.760
<i>I love you.</i>

03:26.840 --> 03:30.440
In your opinion,
when did Meglin start to cross boundaries?

03:34.080 --> 03:38.520
You used “Meglin” and “boundaries”
in the same sentence.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.200
You don’t know him at all!

03:40.280 --> 03:42.560
It’s you who didn’t know him!

03:42.640 --> 03:44.800
Meglin, like many sociopaths,

03:44.880 --> 03:46.960
knew how to manipulate people!

03:47.560 --> 03:50.880
Perhaps you got caught up
in his twisted logic.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.320
A victim of Stockholm syndrome,
if you will.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.560
Judge for yourself.

03:58.280 --> 04:02.640
Meglin did terrible, indescribable things.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.600
And instead of sounding the alarm in time,

04:05.680 --> 04:07.600
you give your approval.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.120
Don’t you think that’s a testimony
to your personal and professional decline?

04:13.200 --> 04:16.600
You don’t think
that you’ve crossed a line?

04:25.920 --> 04:32.720
SERGIEVO-POSAD DISTRICT

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Good afternoon.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.240
It’s the second one this week.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.200
The first was found day before yesterday
on the Dolginsk highway.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.880
Also a man.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.000
Before he was set on fire,

04:55.680 --> 04:56.960
the killer crucified him.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.680
-Got an ID?
-Not yet. We’re working on it.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.120
He burned beautifully!

05:02.200 --> 05:04.000
-Alive?
-What?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.280
I’m asking, were they burned alive?

05:06.360 --> 05:07.960
The first one, yes.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.880
The medical examiner
needs time for this one.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.360
Visually, he can’t tell.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.320
I asked them not to touch anything
till you took a look.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.360
So we’ll take a look now.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.640
Yes, of course.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.240
Call me if you need me.

05:21.040 --> 05:21.760
Let’s go.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.240
Go have a smoke!

05:30.120 --> 05:31.320
What do you see?

05:42.240 --> 05:46.080
He approached this seriously.
Chains and a lock.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.720
He’s highly organized.
It’s planned out to the smallest detail.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.440
What else?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.080
Do you see the phone? A remote fuse?

06:08.640 --> 06:10.600
He walked away and made the call.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.440
The vibration caused a spark.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.360
-And the gas ignited.
-But why so complicated?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.640
Why is he setting them on fire?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.400
Well… to hide the evidence,
cover his tracks.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.400
If he wanted to hide the evidence,
he’d throw them in the river.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.600
Use your head!

06:29.760 --> 06:32.080
He doesn’t want to hide it.
He wants to show it off.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.000
Show it to who?

06:35.560 --> 06:36.760
To all of us.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.920
Why does he burn them?

06:46.480 --> 06:49.560
When the facial muscles burn,

06:49.640 --> 06:53.640
the mouth opens
as if the person is screaming.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.680
He wanted to watch from a distance,
uninterrupted, so he used a fuse.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.160
There you have it.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.720
Here’s where he stood and watched.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.080
He’s on sedatives right now.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.520
Even if you wake him, he can’t talk.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.240
Do you have something for him?

08:20.320 --> 08:22.000
I brought him this.

09:01.920 --> 09:02.920
Hello.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.120
My name is Esenya. I’m an investigator.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.160
I came here to talk to you.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.920
All right, let me help you.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.280
Your name is Olga.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.440
Irina.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.680
Ignatovich.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.360
All right. Irina. How did you end up here?

09:40.040 --> 09:42.000
We lived by the river…

09:44.160 --> 09:45.560
with Valera.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.240
I had two children.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.080
I was so afraid they’d drown,

09:55.160 --> 09:58.080
well… in the river.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.320
I was so afraid.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.920
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

10:04.000 --> 10:05.800
And they drowned.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.200
Valera said I drowned them.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.000
But I couldn’t have.
They were my children.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.680
Why are you called Olga Berestova?

10:24.080 --> 10:25.880
I’m not allowed to…

10:27.160 --> 10:28.920
I’m not allowed to talk about that.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.120
-Who told you that?
-Bergich.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.000
And Andrei too.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.600
I’m working with them.
They know everything.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.000
After…

10:49.040 --> 10:50.800
my children drowned…

10:54.920 --> 10:59.800
they-- they suggested I stay here forever.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.360
In a private ward.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.080
Why did they give you another name?

11:13.560 --> 11:18.080
They said it’d be easier
to forget this way.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.840
I want to forget!

11:25.920 --> 11:27.960
I want to forget!

11:30.160 --> 11:31.840
To forget! Look. Is this Andrei?

11:53.480 --> 11:54.880
Yes, that’s Andrei.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.600
He’s just older.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.560
The first victim was also undressed.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.320
Why does he undress them?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.600
A sexual motive?

12:25.680 --> 12:27.160
They burn faster…

12:28.520 --> 12:30.320
or cleaner somehow.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.320
It’s more aesthetic.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.080
He’s an aesthete?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.040
Regarding this, yes.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.720
Look how he arranged everything.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.520
The site… is a picture.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.160
What’s this?

12:47.840 --> 12:50.280
It’s a piercing.
The first victim had pierced ears.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.200
Two earrings
and one silver ring on his chest.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.520
Stop. What?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.360
Damn your mother!

13:43.840 --> 13:45.400
Are they similar?

13:47.120 --> 13:47.800
The pose.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.280
Vitya Korsakov, a goth.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.120
A sadomasochist
and also a mosaic schizophrenic.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.560
In 2008,
he crucified his wife with her consent.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.600
Well, as for consent…
He worked on her for seven years.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.120
She barely survived. He was found insane.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.800
He was assigned to Bergich’s care.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.840
One of our kind?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.560
Is Bergich on duty?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.400
Well, yes.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.640
He was here for five years.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.840
I released him in July.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.960
He seemed stable to me.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.000
You released him.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.360
Of course. We aren’t a hotel.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.280
No one visited him,
showed interest in him?

14:49.960 --> 14:50.960
No.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.280
You can’t figure out who did this to him?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.960
Do you have access to the archives? Yes. I do.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.200
Esenya, give us a minute.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.720
Give us a minute. Please.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.760
How are you sleeping?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.600
Are you trying to make me an offer?

15:44.720 --> 15:45.920
I’m not sleeping.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.200
Insomnia.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.760
Does your head hurt? How’s your heart?

15:56.840 --> 15:59.040
My head in the morning--
that’s a beautiful thing.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
My heart…

16:03.520 --> 16:07.760
If you’re over 40 and nothing
hurts in the morning, then that means…

16:09.520 --> 16:11.000
And I’m still alive.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.920
Hallucinations?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.440
I’d stay and gossip with you…

16:21.560 --> 16:23.680
but we’re out of time.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.160
That means yes.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.640
You think that it’s you alone
against the world.

16:31.920 --> 16:35.600
You think that, if you stop,
disaster waits.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.920
You alone are saving the world…

16:39.920 --> 16:41.880
from the looming darkness.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.240
Rodion,
do you understand what paraphrenia is?

16:49.640 --> 16:51.680
You’re entering an acute phase.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.360
Are you an idiot, or what?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.400
You’d know better than me.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.160
Fate has given you a chance,
a unique chance.

17:04.359 --> 17:05.920
You could live for years.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.760
A normal life… with her.

17:11.079 --> 17:14.560
You just have to drop work
and stay with me.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.280
For a couple of months.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.119
And if I don’t…

17:29.040 --> 17:30.680
how much time do I have?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.440
Two weeks maximum.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.880
Why are you panicking?

17:43.960 --> 17:45.360
That’s loads of time.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.000
We’ll manage to save the world.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.280
Marusya.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.840
-Marus!
-Go on.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.320
What’s with you? She’s a friend of mine.
Can’t I talk to someone?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.200
Are you going in yourself,
or do you need help? Nikolai, go. I’ll visit you later.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.880
Marusya!

18:13.520 --> 18:15.600
-It’s for your sake.
-I understand. Bye!

18:26.880 --> 18:29.680
How is Pinochet? I mean Nikolai.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.280
Fine. He’s made clear progress.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.760
I think, next time, we won’t
have to go about this so intensely.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.280
I’ve already decreased his medications
by half.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.240
I’m going to release him tomorrow. I understand you’re…

18:49.200 --> 18:51.040
with him all the time now.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.120
Well, yeah.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.760
He needs to take this.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.640
Monitor him. Hourly.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.600
Is it that bad?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.480
We’re still fighting.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.680
The most important thing
is to not let time slip away.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.240
All right.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.840
Put pressure on him!

19:16.480 --> 19:18.800
Make him drop everything and get well.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.080
We’ll pull him through.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.520
PRESCRIPTION

20:20.000 --> 20:21.720
What are you doing here?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.840
-Hello.
-Were you going through my purse?

20:24.920 --> 20:27.520
I think it was you
who introduced the practice.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.200
I came to get my things.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.960
Maybe just this one night,
let’s not get on each other’s nerves.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.480
I want to sleep, truthfully.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.360
I haven’t seen you in two weeks.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.960
You ignore my calls.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.720
I just want to know how you are.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.640
I have that right.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.520
Let’s have some tea.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.480
I’ll brew it with herbs,
just how you like it.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.080
You need it now.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.640
Those are strong medications.
Is he getting worse?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.480
Can he work at all in that state?

21:27.560 --> 21:29.160
What do you care?

21:30.960 --> 21:33.520
First, he’s my friend.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.080
You hate him.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.360
Hate and love are the same.
Didn’t you know?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.480
I’m not worried about him.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.680
Well, not just him.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.240
-Have you talked to him about treatment?
-He can’t drop the case.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.600
He doesn’t want to.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.040
Being an adult, it’s…

21:52.120 --> 21:53.840
It’s about being responsible--

21:53.920 --> 21:56.600
to yourself and those who depend on you.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.200
Are you suggesting
that I medicate him against his will?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.000
Do I understand you correctly?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.320
If you have to.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.120
Do you know what your problem is, Pop?

22:09.720 --> 22:12.160
You always know what’s best for others.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.200
-He’s not mentally stable.
-He’s healthier than you.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.560
Has it ever occurred to you
that you’re a psycho,

22:21.640 --> 22:23.960
with your mania to control everything?

22:26.200 --> 22:27.880
I’m worried about you.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.040
I’m trying to pull you out of the hole
you’re digging yourself into.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.840
Did you try to save Mama too? You were worried about her, right?

22:35.720 --> 22:38.120
Then don’t worry about me.
I want to stay alive!

22:39.480 --> 22:41.320
Don’t you dare talk to me like that.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.120
What’s he filled your head with?

22:48.880 --> 22:51.120
I wanted to save her.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.200
That worked out well.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.800
I loved her.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.480
Love and hate are the same thing.
You said so yourself.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.400
And I don’t know, Pop…

23:13.160 --> 23:14.760
whether I love you or hate you.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.680
Tell me.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.240
What happened to my mother?

23:23.200 --> 23:26.520
Why are you keeping that poor Ignatovich
in the psych ward?

23:28.560 --> 23:30.360
Who is Berestova?

23:32.320 --> 23:33.800
What did Ognaryov find out?

23:36.680 --> 23:39.440
If you lie to me about this,
you’re lying to me about everything.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.120
And I don’t know you at all.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.200
You’ll never find out anything.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I don’t want to see you anymore…

24:03.440 --> 24:05.080
never again in my life.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.440
His system isn’t working! Meglin was her protector.
Now he’s seriously ill.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.480
I saw his medical history.
There will be a crisis every day.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.040
And then he’ll just start killing!

24:40.120 --> 24:41.880
We need to make a decision.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.440
He’s finished.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.280
He’s a hero, a legend.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.800
That doesn’t bother you?

24:59.440 --> 25:03.600
On top of that, deep down,
everyone approves of his methods.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.720
They won’t forgive us for that.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.200
But if, somehow,
it were to turn out different…

25:25.520 --> 25:26.920
I wouldn’t object.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.640
Let’s go.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.280
CASE CLOSED

26:17.360 --> 26:18.600
CASE CLOSED

26:18.680 --> 26:20.000
CASE CLOSED

26:22.040 --> 26:23.960
An evening down memory lane?

26:27.360 --> 26:28.960
Nostalgia. Something like that. Are you looking for something specific?

26:31.760 --> 26:32.960
Stranglers.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.280
The one on the bridge
had a chain around his throat.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.840
Maybe it’s nothing, but maybe it’s a clue.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.920
You think he’s reenacting
the crimes of his victims?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.720
So the second one is also one of us?

27:01.400 --> 27:03.640
Why would someone kill one of ours?

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
Come here.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.840
You already understand everything.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.400
You’re a smart girl.
You just don’t tell anyone.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.600
First he killed the teachers.
Now he’s killing the students.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.480
That’s it. Let’s go.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.080
You drive. Stand there.

27:48.960 --> 27:49.960
Here.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.240
Look.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.280
-Look for what?
-I don’t know!

28:01.520 --> 28:03.040
Something should be there.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.760
ACCESS DENIED

29:35.840 --> 29:36.840
Blocked.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.600
Try Glukhoi.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.840
Come in. Have a seat.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.400
Give me the flash drive.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.080
How is he? Bad.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.200
<i>Let me go.</i>

30:48.800 --> 30:51.560
<i>You animal! Let me go!</i>

30:53.800 --> 30:54.800
<i>Let me go!</i>

30:55.400 --> 30:56.280
<i>Bastard!</i>

30:56.360 --> 30:57.640
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

30:58.720 --> 31:01.640
<i>I told you at the very beginning</i>
<i>that I liked you, Meglin.</i>

31:02.280 --> 31:04.280
<i>Seriously.</i>

31:04.360 --> 31:08.080
<i>But you don’t go all the way.</i>
<i>You don’t look within.</i> <i>And if you don’t know yourself,</i>
<i>then what can you teach?</i>

31:12.760 --> 31:15.120
<i>Take these two-- our kind.</i>

31:15.680 --> 31:18.680
<i>You left them on the edge.</i>
<i>You didn’t let them kill.</i>

31:19.400 --> 31:23.480
<i>You tamed them, visited them,</i>
<i>followed, and cared for them.</i>

31:24.560 --> 31:26.040
<i>You think you saved them.</i>

31:28.240 --> 31:31.360
<i>No. You made them miserable.</i>

31:31.440 --> 31:36.520
<i>You made them hate who they are,</i>
<i>because they were afraid to look within.</i>

31:37.280 --> 31:40.080
<i>No matter. We’ll fix that.</i>

31:40.960 --> 31:46.640
<i>Our kind-- actually, your kind-- will</i>
<i>keep dying until you kill one of them.</i>

31:47.120 --> 31:49.400
<i>Any of them. Your choice.</i> <i>As you say-- the scales.</i>

31:52.240 --> 31:53.560
<i>So weigh the decision.</i>

31:54.160 --> 31:58.040
<i>Either you kill one, or I’ll kill 10.</i>

31:58.120 --> 31:59.600
<i>It’s that simple.</i>

32:00.080 --> 32:02.640
<i>Sorry. I have to make a phone call.</i>

32:02.720 --> 32:04.320
<i>Help me!</i>

32:04.600 --> 32:05.960
<i>People!</i>

32:06.040 --> 32:07.680
<i>Help me!</i>

32:19.960 --> 32:22.920
<i>Kill, Meglin. Feed the beast.</i>

32:23.000 --> 32:24.920
<i>You’re thinking, why?</i>

32:25.000 --> 32:26.880
<i>Well, you should understand.</i>

32:26.960 --> 32:31.160
<i>First, I get satisfaction</i>
<i>in making your life hell.</i>

32:31.240 --> 32:33.360
<i>Second, I’m helping you.</i>

32:33.440 --> 32:35.480
<i>Do you know why they follow me?</i>

32:35.560 --> 32:37.080
<i>Because I don’t lie like you do.</i>

32:37.160 --> 32:39.960
<i>I don’t deceive people</i>
<i>about who they really are.</i>

32:40.520 --> 32:43.040
<i>You, Meglin, are a killer.</i>

32:43.120 --> 32:45.280
<i>You’re not a hero, but a freak.</i>

32:45.720 --> 32:48.160
<i>You’ll never be one of them-- normal.</i>

32:48.240 --> 32:51.080
<i>They tolerate you while you kill for them.</i>

32:51.160 --> 32:53.040
<i>Instead, kill for yourself.</i>

32:54.160 --> 32:55.960
<i>Straightaway, it will become easier.</i>

32:56.040 --> 32:59.200
<i>Make a decision, or I’ll strike closer.</i>

32:59.520 --> 33:01.040
<i>You know the rules.</i>

33:01.120 --> 33:04.120
What do we know? There are two of them.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.240
Not proven.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.320
He’s not killing with his own hands. Well, or he wants us to think that.

33:11.320 --> 33:15.600
Right now that’s not important at all.
We need to understand his system.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.000
He’s not killing for no reason.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.560
There’s a reason for everything.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.640
One more thing.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.720
Glukhoi found a program on the flash drive

33:26.800 --> 33:30.880
that determines the location
of the computer, like a bug.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.160
Closer.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.560
Call Glukhoi, quickly.

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
Hello.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.520
Come in.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.600
Do you want some beer?

34:19.120 --> 34:20.520
Come on, come on.

34:22.239 --> 34:25.040
He needed Glukhoi,
and we handed him over ourselves.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.800
ESENYA

34:36.199 --> 34:37.520
He’s not answering.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.720
He’s here somewhere, watching us.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.800
Look around. Find out where.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.080
Look.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.240
I’d pick the house across the street.
The window facing us is open.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.360
Let’s go.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.680
<i>What, you didn’t catch me, Meglin?</i>
<i>Didn’t you want to?</i>

37:39.680 --> 37:42.120
<i>In your heart, you know I’m right.</i>

37:42.720 --> 37:45.520
<i>You’re swayed by moral prejudices, but…</i>

37:46.240 --> 37:48.360
<i>That’s a coat off someone’s else’s back.</i>

37:48.440 --> 37:50.680
<i>Take it off. Be yourself.</i>

37:52.720 --> 37:53.960
Don’t answer anymore.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.040
We’ve missed the main thing!
It’s under our noses!

37:58.120 --> 38:00.280
Why and how does he kill?

38:01.720 --> 38:04.680
This entire show--
the chains and the nudity-- who’s it for?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.560
For him? For us? No.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.200
It’s for the one
he’s using to do the killing.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.360
He said, “I tell the truth
to the people you lie to.”

38:16.840 --> 38:18.760
That means the killer is one of our own.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.680
But he couldn’t just kill them.
He executed them!

38:22.760 --> 38:24.920
He was the executioner of executioners!

38:25.000 --> 38:27.520
He felt sorry for them,
but he got over that.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.040
No. He burned them… alive.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.520
Because they were screaming…

38:36.760 --> 38:38.520
and they drowned out
someone else’s screams.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.480
I’m thinking…

38:44.440 --> 38:45.840
how did Glukhoi let him in?

39:09.120 --> 39:12.600
TIKHVINSKY DISTRICT

39:31.720 --> 39:33.160
Hello, Kol.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.280
Been out long?

39:36.880 --> 39:38.080
Since yesterday.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.160
I didn’t wait for you. We’re here now.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.240
Are you going somewhere?

39:47.720 --> 39:50.200
Why’d you do it, Kol?

39:54.920 --> 39:56.600
Because it’s me! Me!

39:58.000 --> 39:59.880
And you can’t change me, understand?

40:00.480 --> 40:02.120
Why didn’t you come to me?

40:03.040 --> 40:04.760
Because you lie, Meglin!

40:05.520 --> 40:08.400
You said he wouldn’t scream,
but he screamed.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.080
I smothered him
with electroshock and pills.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.000
But he cried, calling my name!

40:13.080 --> 40:15.720
“Kolya! Kolya! Kolya!”

40:17.520 --> 40:19.480
Why are you staring at me?

40:19.560 --> 40:21.400
I did the same as you! Yes, I killed them, but they were beasts!

40:24.040 --> 40:25.320
Who’s worse off because of this?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.600
They weren’t out killing.
They were under control.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.360
You can’t control that!
Look at me, Meglin!

40:33.680 --> 40:36.480
They would’ve killed,
and you couldn’t have stopped them!

40:39.320 --> 40:42.200
You’re one of us.
You know what I’m talking about.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.440
Meglin…

40:47.640 --> 40:50.320
Let’s kill all those like us.
We’ll do it together.

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
How about it?

40:52.680 --> 40:54.560
I’m the same as you.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.560
I catch people like you.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.640
And you killed an innocent man.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.080
Glukhoi wasn’t one of us.

41:04.800 --> 41:08.880
His family was killed seven years ago.
A wife and child.

41:09.920 --> 41:13.680
I helped find the killer, then killed him.
He started helping me.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.400
He also wanted to cleanse the earth,
but he wasn’t like you.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.360
He was a good man.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.120
You were just taken for a ride.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.360
Help me take him down.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.560
Cleanse the earth, Kolya.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.160
Only fire… cleanses.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.680
I’ll help you.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.240
I’ll tell you who he is.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.000
You have to help me too.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.200
I’ll help you.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.560
I’ll help you.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.160
He’s calling me. He needs me.

42:55.600 --> 42:56.800
Wait in the car.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.400
You’re going to kill him, aren’t you?

43:07.800 --> 43:09.800
Then he’s right. He’s won.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.120
-Wait in the car.
-It’s murder.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.520
It’s not murder. It’s mercy.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.120
One time, I woke up.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.680
The telephone was in my bed.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.360
He called me every night.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.800
We talked for a long time--
two, three hours.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.360
He knew how to listen.

43:40.440 --> 43:43.160
He understood me, like you sometimes.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.960
He told me what to do…

43:48.960 --> 43:50.840
so that Vanya would stop screaming.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.440
He said,

43:58.400 --> 44:01.760
“Do you want to be like Meglin?
Do you want me to help you?”

44:02.440 --> 44:05.280
I said, “Of course I do.
After all, he helped me.”

44:06.840 --> 44:09.400
He gave me a location and a name.

44:13.880 --> 44:15.880
-You saw him?
-Yes.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.440
-He works there.
-Where?

44:18.840 --> 44:22.360
For Bergich.
He opened the doors for me at night.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.000
When I returned in the morning,

44:25.080 --> 44:27.720
I’d lie down and hear him close the door.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.040
It’s so beautiful out.

44:45.760 --> 44:49.080
Meglin, what do you think…

44:52.000 --> 44:53.960
is there something after this?

44:54.040 --> 44:56.320
Of course there is.

45:48.640 --> 45:49.360
Yes.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.520
<i>Hello. It’s me.</i>

45:54.080 --> 45:56.080
He won’t talk to you.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.760
Give him a message.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.880
I’m a man of my word.

46:01.960 --> 46:05.480
<i>I promised I’d stop.</i>

46:06.360 --> 46:07.360
And we won’t!

46:07.440 --> 46:09.080
Do you understand? Monster!

46:10.800 --> 46:13.040
Now that’s a conversation.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.640
-Don’t answer.
-I’m turning it off.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.200
It’s Lazarev.

46:25.760 --> 46:26.600
Yes.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.640
<i>We got him! We found him!</i>

46:28.720 --> 46:31.240
<i>We made a list</i>
<i>of all the hospital employees.</i>

46:31.320 --> 46:32.960
<i>There was an interesting detail.</i>

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
<i>This Leonid Ivanovich Skuteev, a janitor,</i>

46:35.120 --> 46:38.080
<i>was on duty</i>
<i>every time a murder was committed.</i>

46:38.160 --> 46:41.240
<i>He was in our database.</i>

46:41.320 --> 46:43.800
<i>He was never prosecuted,</i>
<i>but there had been a few complaints.</i>

46:43.880 --> 46:45.400
<i>That’s it for now.</i>

46:45.480 --> 46:47.200
I understand. Thanks.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.520
POLICE

46:55.280 --> 46:57.640
Let’s go, let’s go! Move!

47:08.920 --> 47:10.120
Everyone on the ground! You can go.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.960
<i>Well, that’s it.</i>

47:46.080 --> 47:49.080
<i>I could never admit that I was wrong.</i>

47:51.000 --> 47:52.400
<i>And I won’t now.</i>

47:54.360 --> 47:56.320
<i>All these years, I served the monsters…</i>

47:57.440 --> 47:59.600
<i>that were mistaken for humans,</i>

47:59.680 --> 48:02.320
<i>who, for all those years,</i>
<i>tortured those unfortunates,</i>

48:02.400 --> 48:04.440
<i>those who weren’t allowed</i>
<i>to live their lives.</i>

48:04.520 --> 48:06.240
<i>They call them psychos,</i>

48:07.120 --> 48:08.400
<i>crazy,</i>

48:09.120 --> 48:11.000
<i>immoral freaks.</i>

48:11.600 --> 48:13.920
<i>But they’re a thousand times more genuine</i>

48:14.520 --> 48:17.960
<i>smarter, and more compassionate</i>
<i>than their captors.</i>

48:18.560 --> 48:20.400
<i>I couldn’t give them freedom.</i>

48:20.480 --> 48:23.280
<i>I’m guilty of that, but only before them.</i>

48:27.240 --> 48:28.680
<i>You won’t catch me.</i>

48:59.520 --> 49:00.480
Process the scene.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.200
Yes, hello.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.680
“You won’t catch me.” We found him.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.160
How? Wait.

49:23.240 --> 49:26.560
<i>We found out one of Bergich’s patients</i>
<i>was setting people on fire.</i>

49:27.600 --> 49:29.120
Is that for sure?

49:29.200 --> 49:30.960
<i>From a list of employees,</i>

49:31.040 --> 49:34.440
they determined who let him out of
the hospital on the night of the murders.

49:34.520 --> 49:37.200
We wanted to take him,
but he poisoned himself.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.560
He left a video message.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.200
-Congratulations.
-<i>Bye.</i>

49:44.160 --> 49:45.720
Yeah, take care.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.000
Bye.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.360
YOU WON’T CATCH ME

50:20.720 --> 50:22.040
It’s all over.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.960
Nothing is ever over.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.440
I have one request.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.920
Promise you’ll do it.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.280
I promise.

50:50.200 --> 50:51.600
When it starts…

50:53.840 --> 50:55.520
no doctors…

50:57.520 --> 50:59.160
no ambulances.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.400
Just hold my hand.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.000
Nothing is going to happen.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.840
Tomorrow,
you’re going under Bergich’s care.

51:26.280 --> 51:27.920
You have to.

51:40.880 --> 51:44.160
What do you think,
had he decided everything by then?

51:48.840 --> 51:50.240
I don’t know.

52:01.840 --> 52:02.840
Go on.

52:13.640 --> 52:14.960
Sit down.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.200
I’ll stand.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.200
I’ve been sitting for eight years.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.800
Do you remember who put you here?

52:25.760 --> 52:26.600
How is he?

52:27.200 --> 52:30.120
You know how he is. He lives on the edge.

52:30.200 --> 52:33.240
I wouldn’t be surprised
if he runs out of luck soon.

52:34.880 --> 52:36.880
He’s upset the wrong people.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.520
This is an order for your transfer
to a psychiatric hospital

52:45.600 --> 52:47.400
for a routine examination.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.240
ANOFRIEV ALEXEY NIKOLAEVICH

52:52.320 --> 52:55.040
There’s better food, a private room…

52:57.040 --> 52:58.560
walks in the park.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.840
Do we understand each other?
