00:35.619 --> 00:37.277
Which means, which means...

00:37.433 --> 00:39.761
a profit so far this year of...

00:39.933 --> 00:42.926
- 1 800 billion billions.
- Splendid!

00:43.074 --> 00:45.172
This doesn't even include
the added revenue

00:45.328 --> 00:46.972
arising for your take over of ITV!

00:47.262 --> 00:49.981
ITV? I'd forgotten about ITV.
Brilliant!

00:50.501 --> 00:53.496
Gentleman, when I first started
<i>Reynholm Industries</i>,

00:53.810 --> 00:55.688
I had just two things
in my possession:

00:56.281 --> 00:58.470
a dream and 6 million pounds.

01:00.246 --> 01:02.838
Today, I have a business empire,
the like of which...

01:03.118 --> 01:05.287
the world has never seen
the like of which.

01:05.891 --> 01:08.094
Hope it doesn't sound arrogant
when I say...

01:08.349 --> 01:11.635
that I am the greatest man
in the world!

01:13.727 --> 01:15.793
Gentleman, to the future.

01:17.282 --> 01:19.564
Oh, you don't have any glasses.
Just pretend.

01:20.068 --> 01:22.101
- To the future!
- To the future!

01:23.416 --> 01:26.211
Sorry to interrupt
but there are some policemen here,

01:26.611 --> 01:28.144
they say they need to speak to you

01:28.300 --> 01:30.479
about irregularities
in the pension fund.

01:31.027 --> 01:33.464
I see. Could you make me a cup of tea,
please, Stephanie?

01:50.288 --> 01:52.380
Earlier that day... (del VO)

01:53.186 --> 01:54.210
Nice.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.745
- Isn't she a beauty?
- It's certainly a phone.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.837
One sexy PPI screen.

02:00.977 --> 02:03.570
- Wi-Fi enables...
- Ask me what kind of phone I've got.

02:03.898 --> 02:06.856
- What kind of phone have you got?
- It doesn't matter.

02:08.112 --> 02:10.761
Voice recognition.
So let's say I wanted to call my mum,

02:10.966 --> 02:12.940
I just have to say "mum",
and it calls her.

02:13.109 --> 02:15.677
I don't need to do anything.
It's the dogâ€™s bollocks.

02:16.692 --> 02:18.279
Mum, mum, no...

02:18.454 --> 02:20.557
No, I'm sorry.
No, Moss said that.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.399
Yeah, okay, I'll call you later, bye.

02:23.870 --> 02:27.340
Only problem with it is that it's got
a very weedy vibrate setting.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.753
I mean, watch this.

02:33.615 --> 02:34.926
I mean, what is that?

02:35.099 --> 02:36.819
- I'll sort it out.
- Oh, could you?

02:36.966 --> 02:39.208
Just you know, welly up
the vibrator a bit.

02:39.348 --> 02:41.849
Okay, all right.
Now, will you answer this question?

02:42.042 --> 02:43.220
Are we still on this?

02:43.375 --> 02:45.726
You keep interrupting!
We would've been done ages ago,

02:45.906 --> 02:47.606
- but you...
- All right, go on.

02:47.806 --> 02:50.630
Question 39.
When was the last time you exercise?

02:51.680 --> 02:55.501
The last time I exercised was never.

02:55.817 --> 02:59.305
I'm still reeling
from your answer to question 12.

02:59.506 --> 03:00.764
What was question 12?

03:00.965 --> 03:03.214
You brush your teeth in the bath.

03:03.708 --> 03:06.798
- So?
- That's where your balls are.

03:08.665 --> 03:10.310
Okay, question 40.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.088
Do you get your five fruit and veg?

03:13.218 --> 03:15.910
I mean, I certainly try to...
I would say I probably do.

03:16.304 --> 03:18.484
- A day.
- A what?

03:20.465 --> 03:22.031
You're going to love this.

03:22.176 --> 03:24.542
This website takes
all the information you gave me

03:24.682 --> 03:25.882
and guess what it does?

03:26.121 --> 03:28.463
It actually estimates
the date of your death!

03:28.877 --> 03:30.544
- What?
- I know.

03:30.684 --> 03:32.947
- Unbelievable, isn't it?
- What? Wait a second.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.861
I know about those!
Everyone knows about those!

03:36.001 --> 03:39.157
All right, so you've already done it.
So, when's the big day?

03:40.208 --> 03:42.920
I haven't done it!
Why would I want to do it?

03:43.062 --> 03:46.150
- I get March 2nd 2079.
- Oh, my God!

03:46.314 --> 03:48.185
That's right, baby!
I've got 70 more years!

03:48.331 --> 03:50.416
Okay, Moss, close that window!

03:50.556 --> 03:53.242
- I do not wanna know!
- But I've written it all in now.

03:53.637 --> 03:55.688
I do not wanna know
the date of my death.

03:56.118 --> 03:57.301
Close it.

03:58.557 --> 04:00.492
Hello, IT, have you tried
turning it off and...

04:00.647 --> 04:02.292
You know, I'm sick of saying that.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.850
What do you want?

04:04.815 --> 04:06.825
Okay, yeah, someone
will be up in a minute.

04:07.317 --> 04:08.439
Maybe.

04:21.101 --> 04:22.798
You looked!

04:23.579 --> 04:24.851
You know!

04:25.133 --> 04:26.870
You know when I'm going to die!

04:27.010 --> 04:28.027
I do, yes.

04:28.743 --> 04:31.636
- I told you not to look!
- I made a mistake.

04:38.418 --> 04:39.423
When is it?

04:41.048 --> 04:43.569
- You don't wanna know.
- You can't say that to me now!

04:44.142 --> 04:46.811
My advice, Roy,
is to forget all about this.

04:47.599 --> 04:50.134
What, how long more
they've given me, 20 years?

04:51.880 --> 04:53.685
It's less than twenty?

04:54.077 --> 04:56.622
You see, I don't think
this is taking into account leap years.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.844
So that could well be
something to hang on to.

05:00.426 --> 05:01.956
What does it say, Moss?

05:02.163 --> 05:03.797
Does it say I'm already dead?

05:04.744 --> 05:07.052
- No, that would be terrible.
- Thank God.

05:07.337 --> 05:09.013
- It's Thursday.
- What?

05:10.701 --> 05:12.543
- It's Thursday.
- Thursday?

05:12.685 --> 05:14.920
Again, remember, leap years.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.628
It's Thursday!

05:19.203 --> 05:20.746
Thursday the 3rd!

05:20.888 --> 05:23.933
Although, not too late after noon,
so that gives you most of the day.

05:24.088 --> 05:25.591
What? 3 p.m.!

05:25.977 --> 05:29.116
- How could they be that specific?
- Yeah, it's silly.

05:30.531 --> 05:34.090
These things are, at best,
79% accurate.

05:34.961 --> 05:36.017
Oh, good.

05:36.366 --> 05:39.070
I would take no further notice of it.

05:40.729 --> 05:42.346
Yeah, you're right, it's silly.

05:42.486 --> 05:44.644
I will take no further notice of it.

05:45.717 --> 05:49.614
Apparently, there's something wrong with
all the computers on 7th. Who wants it?

05:52.516 --> 05:54.681
You look terrible. Are you ill?

05:56.299 --> 05:57.455
I don't know.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.775
These idiots disabled
the flipping firewall!

06:05.405 --> 06:07.249
Yeah, hello, excuse me.

06:07.390 --> 06:10.075
Thank you, some attention please.

06:10.215 --> 06:12.104
I know you don't think it's "important"

06:12.244 --> 06:14.938
or "cool" but there is
a ruddy good reason

06:15.078 --> 06:17.839
why we put up anti-virus software
and firewalls.

06:17.979 --> 06:21.041
It's because there are
a lot of dangerous things out there.

06:21.290 --> 06:22.421
Jesus!

06:23.188 --> 06:24.745
You know, calm down.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.460
Just don't disable the firewalls.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.535
Okay, 73', that's good, that's good.

06:30.763 --> 06:34.181
And mum,
what age did Uncle Tony die?

06:35.867 --> 06:37.032
32?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.257
It was a car accident?
Brilliant!

06:40.397 --> 06:42.684
Okay, no, I completely forgot... Okay.

06:42.929 --> 06:44.117
Mum, I have to go.

06:44.473 --> 06:47.634
Unbelievable,
some brainiac disabled his firewall

06:47.774 --> 06:51.199
which means that all the computers
on floor 7 are teeming with viruses.

06:51.339 --> 06:54.351
Plus, I've just had to walk all the way
down the mother fudging stairs

06:54.815 --> 06:56.921
because the lift is broken, again.

06:57.622 --> 06:58.630
Oh, my God.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.570
- What?
- Oh, my God.

07:00.710 --> 07:01.807
What? What it is?

07:02.853 --> 07:04.168
Denholm is dead.

07:04.498 --> 07:05.973
Oh, yes, and Denholm is dead.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.670
Okay, everyone ready?

07:14.743 --> 07:17.254
You look great.
We should go to more funerals.

07:18.045 --> 07:20.143
Yeah, except, is there any chance
I could...

07:20.429 --> 07:22.598
- not go to this one?
- No, why?

07:23.127 --> 07:25.483
It's just, you know, funerals.

07:26.143 --> 07:27.481
So morbid.

07:27.988 --> 07:30.114
Would you please forget
this website nonsense?

07:30.254 --> 07:32.022
You are not going to die.

07:32.224 --> 07:34.723
Come on, cheer up!
You're gonna ruin the funeral.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.244
Yeah, you're right.
Pay no attention to me.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.956
I'm being an idiot.

07:40.229 --> 07:41.567
Dead man walking!

07:45.368 --> 07:46.602
Very funny.

07:47.024 --> 07:48.958
You crazy little bastard!

07:50.602 --> 07:52.230
When did you last exercise, Jen?

07:52.490 --> 07:54.454
No, you are not going to do it to me.

07:54.730 --> 07:56.224
- Scared?
- No.

07:56.414 --> 07:58.588
I happen to think
I have a good few years left.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.535
I take plenty of exercise
and I haven't smoked for 3 years.

08:01.743 --> 08:03.372
I didn't know you smoked.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.193
I was on 40 a day by the end.

08:05.348 --> 08:08.269
40 a day, that's 146 002 a decade.

08:08.409 --> 08:11.222
Presuming at least two leap years.
How the flip do you give up?

08:11.810 --> 08:14.059
Basically, pure self-control, Moss.

08:14.269 --> 08:16.142
No, I'd never smoke again.

08:16.810 --> 08:19.256
I'd rather lick a tramp.
Derek, Hello.

08:21.189 --> 08:22.485
Hello, Jen.

08:22.784 --> 08:25.050
Thanks for planting out
those funeral announcements.

08:25.228 --> 08:27.131
Oh, no, I enjoyed doing it.

08:30.539 --> 08:33.365
You know, in a sad way.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.703
- Can I have a word, please?
- Sure.

08:39.577 --> 08:40.977
Hey, oh, my phone.

08:41.118 --> 08:42.919
Oh cool, have you souped up?

08:43.179 --> 08:46.571
Yeah, I totally pimped your phone,
girlfriend.

08:55.937 --> 08:57.293
What set are you setting?

08:57.914 --> 09:00.491
That is the lowest setting.

09:01.576 --> 09:04.487
It shall come as no surprise to you
that I don't like this department.

09:04.637 --> 09:06.045
Never have, never will.

09:06.209 --> 09:08.158
I see no need for an IT department,

09:08.298 --> 09:11.158
I would much rather use this basement
for something important.

09:11.298 --> 09:13.071
Like a big toilet!

09:14.967 --> 09:17.535
I have to say that actually,
it's a bit of a surprise.

09:17.810 --> 09:20.658
- Really? I did send out a memo.
- I didn't get it.

09:20.845 --> 09:23.368
- I had no idea you felt like this.
- Well, I do.

09:24.199 --> 09:26.907
However, I am prepared to give you
another chance.

09:27.047 --> 09:29.797
Another chance? But I didn't know
we'd already had a chance.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.880
This should be the first chance.
You should give us this chance.

09:33.065 --> 09:34.524
And then, another chance.

09:45.035 --> 09:46.895
OK, I'll get it! Give me a call!

09:48.401 --> 09:49.856
I got to put it up to 5.

09:50.749 --> 09:52.395
I'm gonna put it in my pocket!

09:58.432 --> 10:00.121
Put it up to 8!
Put it up to 8!

10:00.277 --> 10:03.168
I'm not gonna put it up to 8, Moss!
It'll blow my cock off.

10:04.733 --> 10:07.150
- Come on, come on. Put it up!
- Okay, I'll put it up.

10:09.614 --> 10:13.646
You do know
we are burying a great man today!

10:15.774 --> 10:17.154
Did someone else die?

10:18.917 --> 10:20.790
I mean, Mr. Reynholm!

10:24.155 --> 10:25.548
"Did someone else die?"

10:25.711 --> 10:26.865
Oh, I didn't know.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.510
You have to be careful,
he's our new boss.

10:29.799 --> 10:32.013
He hates us, he keeps saying
that there's no need

10:32.239 --> 10:34.976
- for an IT department.
- Why didn't anyone tell me this?

10:35.290 --> 10:36.878
There was a memo.
It just said:

10:37.029 --> 10:38.728
"I hate the IT Department."

10:43.526 --> 10:45.882
You are not coming to the funeral,
Richmond!

10:46.527 --> 10:47.588
What funeral?

11:08.359 --> 11:11.406
- Has anyone got the right time?
- It's twenty to three.

11:11.649 --> 11:13.142
I'll make it a quarter, too.

11:13.389 --> 11:17.293
Why? Yes! Because that website said
you were going to die at 3pm, didn't it?

11:17.453 --> 11:20.619
- Did it? I can't remember.
- How could you forget?

11:20.764 --> 11:23.309
It clearly stated that
you were going to die, today.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.177
At precisely 3:00.
Unless, it was tomorrow.

11:26.867 --> 11:29.106
But no, it's today, at 3:00.

11:29.246 --> 11:31.232
Well, would you put it
out of your mind?

11:32.120 --> 11:34.279
Right, you're right, out of my mind.

11:51.615 --> 11:53.301
Okay, there's Denholm's wife.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.345
I never know what to say
to people at funeral.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.009
Neither do I. I'm terrible.

11:59.165 --> 12:01.911
Oh, just say "I'm sorry for your lost",
then move on.

12:04.297 --> 12:06.275
- He'll be in our prayers.
- Thank you.

12:08.506 --> 12:10.210
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.384
Move on.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.343
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

12:18.432 --> 12:20.507
It's not like you've lost a pen, is it?

12:20.687 --> 12:22.912
It's so much worse.

12:25.107 --> 12:26.412
Would you like a pen?

12:26.612 --> 12:28.643
- I have this spare one.
- Oh, no, thank you.

12:29.127 --> 12:32.131
- Please, take it.
- Why are you giving it to me?

12:32.958 --> 12:34.056
I don't know.

12:37.001 --> 12:38.475
It swings an under balance.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.940
Death!

12:51.619 --> 12:53.121
Death is coming!

12:54.097 --> 12:55.346
Death is here...

12:56.431 --> 12:57.595
Death is outside...

12:58.315 --> 12:59.582
There's no escape.

13:00.428 --> 13:02.503
I don't like the way
Derek's looking at us.

13:07.004 --> 13:08.741
Who's that knocking at the door?

13:09.858 --> 13:10.858
Yes...

13:11.393 --> 13:13.120
It's death! Yet it'd be.

13:13.734 --> 13:14.791
Is this normal?

13:14.954 --> 13:18.062
Death came for Denholm
just as it will come for you.

13:19.543 --> 13:20.824
Who will be next?

13:21.918 --> 13:22.932
You?

13:23.920 --> 13:24.870
Maybe you...

13:27.211 --> 13:30.323
- We are gathered here to...
- What's wrong with you?

13:30.671 --> 13:32.916
- ...past of a great man.
- Nothing.

13:34.455 --> 13:35.455
A man...

13:36.088 --> 13:37.288
...like us.

13:39.977 --> 13:43.218
I've never seen a grand-father clock
in a church before.

13:43.471 --> 13:45.133
Yet, the one was a second hand.

13:45.447 --> 13:47.075
Yes, he had more money than...

13:47.717 --> 13:51.127
most of us here today.
But did that make him a better man?

13:54.843 --> 13:57.819
We know Denholm was a man of money.

13:58.689 --> 14:00.412
Yes, he had more money...

14:02.279 --> 14:04.523
than any of us here.

14:11.596 --> 14:13.117
Oh, no! Jesus!

14:17.324 --> 14:18.749
Jesus Christ!

14:19.141 --> 14:21.501
Holy...!
Call me an ambulance!

14:22.147 --> 14:23.978
I'm not f****** joking!

14:24.246 --> 14:25.519
And get an ambulance!

14:25.889 --> 14:27.852
I'm not f****** joking!

14:28.064 --> 14:30.005
Call me a f****** ambulance!

14:33.636 --> 14:34.892
Oh, no, wait...

14:36.422 --> 14:37.651
That's my phone!

14:40.463 --> 14:42.595
I think that... It's...

14:44.153 --> 14:46.304
Let's see if... I can't leave it.

14:47.026 --> 14:49.899
I can't leave it. I'll turn it off.
I've just been set up.

14:50.859 --> 14:52.408
Oh, God f***!

14:56.392 --> 14:57.399
Go on!

14:59.271 --> 15:00.734
Oh, it's gone to message.

15:00.978 --> 15:03.933
Hey, Roy, nothing important!
Just wondering how the funeral went.

15:04.081 --> 15:05.274
Call me back.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.906
If we are all quite ready,

15:11.079 --> 15:14.967
Denholm instructed that this short film
be played before the service.

15:18.943 --> 15:21.017
You're all out of there!
You are out of there!

15:21.347 --> 15:22.559
You're history!

15:27.502 --> 15:30.339
<i>If you're watching this,
it means I'm dead, now.</i>

15:30.906 --> 15:32.839
<i>And it's all thanks
to these little things.</i>

15:33.648 --> 15:35.141
- Wrong!
- Shut up!

15:37.601 --> 15:40.075
<i>Cigarettes have finally killed me.</i>

15:40.323 --> 15:42.812
<i>Like they killed my father,
my father's father,</i>

15:42.954 --> 15:46.200
<i>my mother's father, my mother,
and her father.</i>

15:47.728 --> 15:50.575
<i>I just can't seem to give
the damn things up. I love them!</i>

15:51.543 --> 15:53.816
<i>Sweet smoky cigarettes.</i>

16:02.231 --> 16:03.891
<i>You delicious bastards!</i>

16:18.423 --> 16:19.747
<i>Final clause, Stephanie,</i>

16:19.889 --> 16:23.211
<i>could you categorise the personel files
alphabetically from now on?</i>

16:23.427 --> 16:25.433
<i>That rhyming thing, this isn't working.</i>

16:25.576 --> 16:28.137
<i>Also call Who's Who
and get them to update my entry.</i>

16:28.615 --> 16:31.920
<i>Well, thanks everyone for coming!
Enjoy the rest of the funeral.</i>

16:39.862 --> 16:41.877
Well said, sir!

16:42.702 --> 16:45.138
I will now ask Mr. Pippin
to read the eulogy.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.793
I see a lot of faces out there.

16:54.532 --> 16:57.598
Some of you I know, some of you
I hope to get to know better

16:57.759 --> 16:59.430
over the coming months.

17:00.105 --> 17:02.983
Some of you I probably won't be
seeing very much off, after today!

17:04.362 --> 17:06.028
The reading of the eulogy

17:06.207 --> 17:09.200
is a duty normally left
to the eldest child.

17:09.827 --> 17:12.478
But, as you all know,
Denholm's son Douglas

17:12.675 --> 17:16.508
mysteriously disappeared
after a lengthy court case, 7 years ago.

17:18.011 --> 17:21.555
Let me start by reading this poem
that I saw

17:22.096 --> 17:24.326
in the film <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>.

17:26.594 --> 17:29.467
"Stop... all the clocks."

17:36.410 --> 17:39.433
Father!

17:49.730 --> 17:52.611
- Tits!
- We're just a small church.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.020
Unhappy priest!

18:05.427 --> 18:06.920
Where is your God?

18:07.081 --> 18:09.014
Where is your God now!

18:09.427 --> 18:11.863
Here lies a great man!

18:12.329 --> 18:13.731
A great man!

18:14.088 --> 18:16.022
Father!

18:21.169 --> 18:24.061
- Did I miss anything?
- They just started Denholm's eulogy.

18:26.611 --> 18:27.739
You stink!

18:28.283 --> 18:30.387
I just smoked a cigarette from a drain.

18:32.259 --> 18:33.477
Well, who's this?

18:34.319 --> 18:36.783
- Hi, I'm Douglas.
- Jen Barber.

18:37.186 --> 18:39.883
Beautiful second name!
What're you doing after the funeral?

18:41.615 --> 18:43.512
- Douglas!
- Speak, priest!

18:43.673 --> 18:46.611
No, I'm a vic...
Your father prepared a second tape

18:46.754 --> 18:49.398
- in the event of your sudden arrival.
- A second tape?

18:49.847 --> 18:50.847
I see...

18:51.742 --> 18:54.608
- Actually, I don't follow.
- I'll just put in on.

19:00.576 --> 19:03.630
<i>Hello again. If you're watching this,</i>

19:03.959 --> 19:06.588
<i>it's because my son from my 1st marriage
has arrived,</i>

19:06.826 --> 19:10.413
<i>caused a scene, and is currently
chatting up some nearby trouble.</i>

19:10.803 --> 19:11.883
Quiet, woman!

19:12.114 --> 19:14.160
<i>I have something important
to tell you.</i>

19:14.334 --> 19:15.775
I'm here, <i>papa</i>!

19:15.916 --> 19:18.495
Reynholm Industries <i>is now yours.</i>

19:19.619 --> 19:22.399
- My Lord, thank you father.
<i>- But it's yours at a price.</i>

19:23.103 --> 19:26.375
<i>I want you to promise me now,
in front of all your new employees,</i>

19:26.519 --> 19:28.249
<i>that you will never again</i>

19:28.525 --> 19:30.925
<i>become embroiled
in a sexual harassment case</i>

19:31.075 --> 19:33.436
<i>- that dangers the company.</i>
- I promise, father.

19:36.251 --> 19:38.989
<i>There's one more thing,
but it's for your ears only.</i>

19:39.208 --> 19:41.590
<i>So, I want you to stop the tape,
take it home,</i>

19:41.960 --> 19:45.069
<i>- and watch it again later in private.</i>
- But these are my new family.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.632
I have no secrets from them!

19:47.447 --> 19:50.056
<i>OK, Douglas. Now we're alone,
I can speak frankly.</i>

19:50.199 --> 19:52.786
<i>You may receive a visit
from the police at some point</i>

19:52.928 --> 19:55.043
<i>concerning irregularities
in the pension fund.</i>

19:55.185 --> 19:56.231
Turn that off.

19:56.699 --> 19:59.817
<i>I've been using a very creative
accountant recently released from jail</i>

20:00.954 --> 20:04.093
<i>- to manage what I call the suck fund!</i>
- Where is the remote?

20:04.277 --> 20:07.012
<i>- Now, the suck fund...</i>
- I'll do it myself!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.499
Good bye, father!

20:13.615 --> 20:15.963
Right, I'm off.
I'll see you all on Monday.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.912
Douglas! Sorry,

20:18.200 --> 20:20.084
I didn't mean to. Derek Pippin!

20:20.488 --> 20:22.268
I worked very closely with your father.

20:22.644 --> 20:24.139
Derek, good to meet you.

20:24.343 --> 20:27.813
I'm afraid I'll be bringing in my own
people, so you're immediately fired.

20:28.363 --> 20:29.909
Okay, good luck everyone, and...

20:30.715 --> 20:32.614
I'll see you later.

20:37.638 --> 20:40.184
- ...and you are ready to go!
- Brilliant!

20:40.790 --> 20:42.375
Thank you, computer man!

20:43.831 --> 20:47.533
I'm told my father was particularly
proud of the IT department.

20:48.017 --> 20:49.747
Run by a dynamic go-getter,

20:49.951 --> 20:51.903
a genius, and a man from Ireland!

20:53.345 --> 20:54.402
One last thing.

20:54.866 --> 20:57.926
How do I erase files like this one here,
marked pensions?

20:59.453 --> 21:01.314
- Just like this.
- All gone!

21:01.762 --> 21:03.498
Wonderful. Thanks, guys.

21:03.714 --> 21:06.275
I'll be working very closely
with your department.

21:06.770 --> 21:08.962
And I have a feeling I'll be needing you

21:09.302 --> 21:12.436
for a lot more than
just deleting incriminating files.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.558
I just mean files.

21:18.061 --> 21:20.708
- OK, we'd better be off.
- By the way...

21:21.499 --> 21:25.434
Where's that ootsie-tootsie
humdinging-coochie mama-boss of yours?

21:26.973 --> 21:30.252
She went home early.
She said she had some catching up to do.

21:37.101 --> 21:38.623
One last thing.

21:39.107 --> 21:40.808
I sorted out this for you.

21:41.185 --> 21:44.555
Now, I'm afraid the vibrate setting
is still a little weedy.

21:44.766 --> 21:47.062
So, you may wanna
put it all the way up to ten.

21:48.491 --> 21:49.491
Ten!

21:50.110 --> 21:51.375
Shall I do...

21:52.060 --> 21:53.381
...done...

21:53.882 --> 21:54.975
...and done!

22:02.771 --> 22:04.377
Sorry about this, old man!

22:23.171 --> 22:24.492
Now, I like that!

22:41.155 --> 22:42.751
Nearly at the station!
