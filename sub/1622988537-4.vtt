00:53.720 --> 00:54.888
Excuse me.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.065
Who do you work for?

01:10.195 --> 01:11.697
I saw you there,

01:12.447 --> 01:14.366
leading the cleanup, so I know.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.120
And all those dead birds
popping up around town?

01:20.873 --> 01:24.710
I think the water in that pond
is poisoning them, and the fish.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.130
And people, people like my Pop-Pop.

01:28.213 --> 01:32.301
And I'm not gonna stop
until I find out the truth.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.728
I'm not afraid of you!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.967
Guess what happened
at the gas station today.

02:14.051 --> 02:18.180
I was just there, getting myself a drink,
and then he was right behind me.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.224
The guy that's been following me.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.059
Wait. Someone's following you now?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.562
Not exactly, but it's the guy
I've seen before from the pond.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.356
I ran into him at the gas station.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.982
Did he say anything to you?

02:29.066 --> 02:32.152
Just, "Excuse me,"
and then he got himself a drink.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.862
Oh, no. He sounds terrible.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.448
But I could tell
he was trying to intimidate me.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.325
What, because he got a drink?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.744
-Dad?
-Iz, let her finish.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.330
Hilde, we're just trying
to understand what happened.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.667
This is the guy. He's trying to tell me
that he's got his eye on me.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.627
Well, did he threaten you?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.629
She just said he totally ignored her.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.381
It's classic witness intimidation.

02:52.464 --> 02:56.510
Whoever this guy works for
is responsible for covering up the pond.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.638
Yeah, okay. Can we just
hit pause on this just for a moment

02:59.721 --> 03:01.932
until we get some dinner
actually on the table?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.601
Seriously, Hilde.
You're like some old-person Reddit feed,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.687
-but inside my house.
-Hey, hey, hey.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.230
-I mean--
-Watch it.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.526
Didn't you just make a bunch of people
happy because you cleaned up some pond?

03:12.609 --> 03:15.612
Can't you just, I don't know,
enjoy that for ten full seconds

03:15.696 --> 03:17.698
before you move on to the next conspiracy?

03:28.292 --> 03:29.293
No.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.088
'Cause every day, he's getting worse,
and no one is helping.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.716
My camera!

03:35.799 --> 03:38.635
-It's okay.
-Dad, I broke it.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.014
-I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it.
-That's okay. It's fine.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.558
-Let's take a look at it.
-We know you didn't.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.560
It's all right. It just needs a new lens.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.271
All right, just give me a few days.
I'll figure something out.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.940
A few days? That's too long.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.233
Here you go.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.819
All right, look at that.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.905
Look at that. Thanks, Pop.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.073
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.658
Hey, what do you think?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.827
Where's the screen?

04:03.911 --> 04:04.953
-No, it's a--
-No.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.789
There's no screen, sweetie.
This is special.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.541
This one is a film camera,

04:09.625 --> 04:11.877
and you gotta develop the film
after you take the photos.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.587
Back in the day,
you used to take pictures,

04:13.670 --> 04:15.547
and then when you'd finally
get done with a roll,

04:15.631 --> 04:18.591
you'd take it to the drugstore,
and they would develop it.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.595
Yeah, then a couple of weeks later,
you go pick it up.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.515
You'd be so excited to get the photos.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.558
Yeah, by that time, so much time's passed,

04:26.642 --> 04:29.603
you can't even remember why
you took the photos in the first place.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.314
Look, don't worry.
I will show you how to develop.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.525
All right? It'll be fun.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.903
What are you guys talking about?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.784
No, no, I'm sorry,
he never mentioned that.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.997
No, of course. No, that's fine.
No, I'm happy to pop down. Sure.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.709
Yeah, okay. All right, will do. Thank you.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.794
Thanks.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.088
Who was that?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.466
That was the harbormaster.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.762
Yeah, apparently my dad's still
renting out the boat slip at the marina.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.181
I'll head over there and figure it out.

05:07.850 --> 05:12.187
You know,
he seemed better tonight at dinner.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.272
Don't you think?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
Yeah.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.194
Yeah, he was fine.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.530
What?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.201
Look, it's...

05:27.494 --> 05:28.495
it's terrible to say,

05:28.579 --> 05:34.418
but I'm not sure that Syl having
these moments of lucidity is helping us.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.254
With Hilde, I mean.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.757
What? You think it's giving her
a false sense of hope?

05:41.258 --> 05:46.013
Yeah. I mean, she thinks that if she can
solve this whole poisoning mystery,

05:46.096 --> 05:51.059
that it'll lead to some treatment for him
that'll turn things around.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.772
Yeah, but do you wanna be the one
to tell her that it's not gonna work out?

05:56.398 --> 05:59.443
No, I don't. Do you?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.196
No, I do not.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.572
Look, I want her...

06:04.865 --> 06:09.578
to believe that he is
gonna live forever, you know?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.289
That we all are.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.087
Oh, honey.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.182
Hey. Come here for a second.

06:32.601 --> 06:36.146
I have to get a gift for my girlfriend,
but she's really picky.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.815
You're good with clothes.
What should I get her?

06:38.899 --> 06:42.027
Well, accessories are always
a good place to start.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.614
And oversized scrunchies
are really in right now.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.783
Like, a lot of girls are wearing them.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.285
So maybe get her some pastel ones
for spring?

06:50.369 --> 06:53.622
Yeah. Whatever.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.582
What was that about?

06:55.666 --> 06:56.917
Nothing. What's up?

06:57.417 --> 07:00.128
Did you guys see the press release
put out by the town?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.213
Mm-mmm.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.466
They said tests confirmed
blue-green algae in the pond water.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.302
That's great. So that means
Walter is gonna be okay, right?

07:07.386 --> 07:08.929
Thank goodness. I love that bird.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.765
So, we're just supposed to accept
what the press release said,

07:11.849 --> 07:13.058
no questions asked?

07:13.141 --> 07:16.436
Yeah, maybe Walter will get better,
but what about my grandpa?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.523
We need to find out
who covered up that pond.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.984
And then we can figure out
why they really did it.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.699
So who really paid for the cleanup?

07:28.782 --> 07:32.202
There was a ton of equipment there.
It must've been expensive.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.037
The town said it was anonymous donors.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.248
Rich people in masks, like Batman.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.126
-They don't wanna be found out.
-Exactly.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.044
So what's our next move?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.672
Follow the money.
You can always follow the money.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.258
The town may have hidden
where the money came from,

07:46.341 --> 07:48.343
but we can still go to the source.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.055
Whoever paid the construction companies
must be the anonymous donor.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.183
We just have to find someone
willing to talk.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.101
Thank you so much.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.479
-I've got one.
-Finally.

08:02.274 --> 08:06.528
Most people were paid directly
by the town, except for this contractor.

08:06.612 --> 08:10.282
They say they've been paid by a company
called Strata Tech Industries.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.118
-No way. My dad works there.
-He does?

08:13.202 --> 08:14.828
He just started his new job there.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.748
-Could you take us to his office?
-Sure.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.477
Hey, lady.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.063
You need a ride home?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.147
Oh, Emma.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.108
I've got detention.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.319
That sucks.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.947
But, you know,
you could always just, like, not go.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.907
Yeah, and risk getting more detention?

08:52.449 --> 08:55.327
I wish that was me, but I'm in, like,
so much trouble right now.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.411
Right.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.332
Are you doing okay?
I feel so bad about you and Jessica.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.378
I really miss her. She was, like,
the coolest thing about this place.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.964
Yeah. I mean, I'm standing right here.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.389
-Guess I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.269
Hey, Principal Collins.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.479
-Can I speak to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.482
I was on the video with the eggs.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.527
I mean, I wasn't on the video, like,
I'm not on camera,

09:28.610 --> 09:30.320
but I was there.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.657
I just saw how much trouble
Izzy and Jessica got into and I--

09:33.740 --> 09:36.493
I'm starting to feel, like,
really, really bad about it.

09:36.577 --> 09:40.289
Wow. I appreciate you stepping up
like this and taking responsibility.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.957
It's the right thing to do.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.377
But I'm also a little curious
as to why you're telling me this now.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.089
I mean, I don't wanna punish you
for doing the right thing,

09:49.173 --> 09:52.092
but also,
I don't wanna set a bad precedent either.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.678
Yeah. No, you shouldn't do that.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.557
Not to pile on here,
but you were late this morning again.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.100
Fifth time.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.686
Yeah, I'm not really a morning person.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.230
Detention this week. Same as Izzy.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.033
-Why would you do that?
-Solidarity.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.463
Wanna renew the slip for another year?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.964
This is it here.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.352
Come on, Matty. Let's go.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.103
Fish are biting.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.614
Anchors aweigh.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.620
Yeah, I don't think
we're gonna need this slip anymore.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.705
I think my dad's boating days are over.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.958
Well, she's paid up
till the end of the month.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.294
If you wanna clean her up, I'll put
the word out that you're looking to sell.

11:09.378 --> 11:12.548
Yeah, I wouldn't even know how
to refurbish something like that.

11:12.631 --> 11:13.924
Well, suit yourself.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.477
Come on, you guys.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.858
Guys, guys, hold up. Hold up.
I wanna take a picture. All right.

11:31.775 --> 11:35.320
Get together. You guys. All right, smile.

12:05.976 --> 12:06.977
Thank you.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.401
Welcome to Strata Tech industries.
How can I help you?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.403
We're from The Magic Hour Chronicle.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.447
The what?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.157
We have a few questions

12:20.240 --> 12:23.619
about Strata's anonymous donation
to the Pinewood pond cleanup.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.954
Is there someone you're here to see?

12:26.038 --> 12:28.916
Is Michael Davis available?
He's sort of my dad.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.293
Not sort of, all the way. Fully my dad.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.128
Hilde Lisko?

12:33.962 --> 12:36.882
I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. I've got this.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.800
Clearly, you don't read
The Magic Hour Chronicle,

12:38.884 --> 12:41.428
otherwise you'd know
you're talking to the editorial board.

12:41.512 --> 12:42.513
And you are?

12:42.596 --> 12:46.517
-Grant Williams. I run the place.
-Like, the whole place?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.978
Yeah. I've got a few minutes.
Would you like the grand tour?

12:50.062 --> 12:51.063
Sure.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.148
I'd actually been meaning
to reach out to you

12:53.232 --> 12:55.108
about pitching an article to your paper.

12:55.192 --> 12:58.153
You see, we're working on trying to become
one of the greenest companies

12:58.237 --> 13:01.448
in the Pacific Northwest and,
well, I thought maybe you might

13:01.532 --> 13:03.742
let the town know about
some of our new initiatives.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.287
-We don't do puff pieces.
-Are you sure you mean our paper?

13:10.666 --> 13:12.125
This is my family's business.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.670
I inherited it from my dad
and my grandfather.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.964
They've been building planes
for generations.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.844
-You kids don't like snacks, do you?
-Is that a trick question?

13:21.927 --> 13:24.555
Check those cabinets.
My secret hiding place.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.639
Snacks!

13:26.306 --> 13:27.641
Donny, put this in your bag.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.020
The reason we're here...

13:33.564 --> 13:38.151
We found out that Strata made a donation
anonymously to the Pinewood pond cleanup.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.905
-Correct.
-But they didn't clean the pond.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.492
-They paved over it.
-That's what the city wanted to do.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.744
And we try to be
supportive of Erie Harbor.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.884
Does everyone have one of those?

14:02.467 --> 14:05.888
Key cards? All our employees
have some version of them, yeah.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.015
It's just that I keep seeing this guy,

14:08.098 --> 14:12.311
and I saw him at the pond cleanup
and then again yesterday.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.563
And he's acting really weird,

14:14.646 --> 14:16.857
so I'm trying to figure out
who he works for.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.901
And he had a card like that?

14:18.984 --> 14:22.237
Not exactly but sort of, yeah.

14:22.863 --> 14:23.947
Could he work here?

14:24.031 --> 14:26.074
You can have a look at
our employee ID photos.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.451
Maybe you'll recognize him.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.994
Don't take this the wrong way,

14:29.077 --> 14:32.080
but why do you actually answer
my questions?

14:32.164 --> 14:34.458
It's just that adults
don't usually do that.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.252
I know everyone talks about
the Richie Fife story

14:37.336 --> 14:41.215
and what a big deal that was,
but I thought that little piece you did

14:41.298 --> 14:45.302
on the ethical treatment of animals
in pet stores was really compelling.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.597
I thought nobody read that.
It got, like, four clicks.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.974
Well, all four clicks might have been me,

14:51.058 --> 14:54.728
but I donated $20,000 to the Erie Harbor
Animal Shelter because of it.

14:54.811 --> 14:55.812
Really?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.484
Think you guys
might have missed a little bit.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.568
Really?

15:02.194 --> 15:03.779
There was a chocolate section?

15:16.834 --> 15:19.086
Hey, Frank. See you a second?

15:27.469 --> 15:29.471
You're not gonna like what I'm gonna say,

15:30.347 --> 15:32.724
but I need to expand
your patrol territory.

15:32.808 --> 15:33.809
Yeah, fine.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.270
-Got it.
-Well, I don't need the attitude.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.647
What attitude?

15:39.523 --> 15:42.067
No, I was just being like, "Copy that."

15:42.150 --> 15:43.652
Like, "I'm on it."

15:43.735 --> 15:45.529
All right, I'm sorry. I just...

15:46.196 --> 15:47.990
I don't know. I got Rutherford on me.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.783
That man is always taking notes,

15:49.867 --> 15:52.035
writing down every time
I go to the bathroom.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.746
Like there's some approved number,
and I'm way over it.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.540
Well, you do drink a lot of coffee.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.627
Okay, so how can I help?

16:00.711 --> 16:02.754
Just asking that is enough.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.132
Just do the extra patrols.

16:05.799 --> 16:10.095
And maybe run a little interference for me
with Hilde and her cohorts?

16:10.179 --> 16:14.099
You know, I could put a banana
in Rutherford's tailpipe too,

16:14.183 --> 16:15.184
if that would help.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.312
Don't play with me.
I might take you up on that.

16:21.565 --> 16:22.566
Watch that.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.825
-Is that him?
-Mm-mmm.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.496
No. Is that the last one?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.581
Looks like it.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.417
Are you sure?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.753
But if you do ever see this man again,

16:42.836 --> 16:44.838
I would appreciate it
if you'd let me know.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.469
-You tell your parents?
-They know.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.637
Good.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.847
Thanks for your help, Mr. Williams.

16:53.931 --> 16:57.809
I hope you solve
all the mysteries of life, Hilde Lisko.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.978
Starting with this one.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.026
I know there's more
to the pond cleanup story,

17:06.108 --> 17:07.778
but every lead's a dead end.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.695
Strata turned up nothing,

17:09.780 --> 17:13.282
and the CEO said it was
the town's decision to pave over it.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.577
Is there any reason
you think they might be lying?

17:15.661 --> 17:18.454
No. I even checked
with the pet rescue place,

17:18.539 --> 17:22.917
and there was a big donation made after
my article came out, just like Grant said.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.796
Well, you know,
that's the way it goes, Hilde.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.466
Sometimes you follow the wrong detail,
and it leads you down a rabbit hole.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.134
I know.

17:31.635 --> 17:35.472
I even thought that key card
was going to turn out to be some big clue,

17:35.556 --> 17:37.432
but it turns out everyone has one.

17:37.516 --> 17:38.517
And--

17:41.061 --> 17:42.688
Why's it so red in here?

17:42.771 --> 17:46.567
Well, this is a darkroom.
Here, come on. Check it out.

17:47.568 --> 17:51.321
This is all my old photography equipment
from when I was back in high school.

17:51.405 --> 17:54.575
This is actually the reason I fell in love
with journalism in the first place.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.952
Taking pictures, I love it.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.912
Why don't they call it a red room?

17:58.996 --> 18:01.790
Because light ruins the film
before it's developed,

18:01.874 --> 18:05.794
so you gotta keep the room dark,
and this red light doesn't affect it.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.714
All right, come on.
Let's see what you got.

18:57.930 --> 19:01.350
Yeah, it took some practice
to get the hang of Pop-Pop's camera, huh?

19:01.433 --> 19:02.768
Well, you're getting there.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.490
All right, yeah. That is something.

19:42.474 --> 19:43.767
I've seen this before.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.649
It was on the basement door
at the mansion. Look.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.901
And here on the sidewalk.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.574
Yeah? Oh, you're right.

20:02.828 --> 20:04.997
Jessica was, like, my only friend here.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.417
And now she's leaving, and I'm gonna be
completely alone all over again.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.793
I hate my life.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.378
Please don't say that.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.380
It feels like you're a million miles away.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.090
How's this even gonna work?

20:15.591 --> 20:17.885
Don't worry. We'll figure it out.

20:17.968 --> 20:21.180
I know there's already some girl there
that's, like, slid into your DMs,

20:21.263 --> 20:23.891
and next thing, she's just gonna
happen to be by your locker

20:23.974 --> 20:26.268
-every day.
-Okay, that's not gonna happen.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.394
I won't let it.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.314
You're the only person-- I mean, girl--

20:30.898 --> 20:32.316
I mean-- You know what I mean.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.276
You're the only human that I want.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.861
Oh, my God, Ethan.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.071
Who's Ethan?

20:39.323 --> 20:40.949
We were just finishing up.

20:41.909 --> 20:42.910
What's going on?

20:42.993 --> 20:45.120
-It's my grandfather. I gotta go.
-But--

20:45.204 --> 20:47.289
We were just finishing.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.961
You're in love with that boy.
I can hear it in your voice.

20:55.047 --> 20:56.256
Yeah, maybe.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.843
I guess.
I don't even really know what that means.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.388
What did you do?

21:04.223 --> 21:09.978
Like, after Grandma died and you were,
you know, left behind?

21:10.938 --> 21:13.232
I mean, I know it's not the same, but...

21:14.399 --> 21:19.112
You mean the distance,
the space between you.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.614
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.366
I wished for more time.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.368
I couldn't have it, but...

21:25.369 --> 21:26.995
that's what I wanted.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.040
To do what?

21:32.417 --> 21:33.836
All the little things,

21:33.919 --> 21:39.383
like setting the table,
or going to the grocery store together,

21:39.466 --> 21:44.054
or touching her arm when she was sleeping.

21:44.555 --> 21:46.974
It's not very romantic, but...

21:48.600 --> 21:50.185
those are the things I miss,

21:50.811 --> 21:54.690
the things I'd travel any distance to...

21:58.569 --> 21:59.945
to get back.

22:01.822 --> 22:05.742
And that's why I came in here now,
'cause I heard you talking on the phone.

22:07.411 --> 22:09.121
And I wanted to sit next to you.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.792
-I'm glad you're here, Pop-Pop.
-Me too.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.477
What's so urgent?

22:32.561 --> 22:35.022
You know I don't like to sweat
in my shirts before school.

22:36.773 --> 22:37.858
Donny, look.

22:37.941 --> 22:42.571
I've been looking at this symbol like
it meant something, but it's everywhere.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.908
-It's on half of the sidewalks in town.
-I've seen this.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.701
What does it mean?

22:47.784 --> 22:52.372
I'm thinking it's a Wott company logo
or maybe a family crest or something.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.000
I need to get a closer look.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.255
I have more photos in the basement
on here somewhere.

23:01.298 --> 23:04.301
Wait. Go back.

23:07.846 --> 23:08.847
There.

23:10.974 --> 23:11.975
It's him.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.062
He really is following me.

23:16.855 --> 23:22.236
So, the door, this guy, Wott Management,
they're all connected.

23:22.319 --> 23:24.238
Spoon won't believe this.

23:24.321 --> 23:26.907
We gotta find out
what they're hiding in that basement.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.961
Dad, you okay?

23:40.337 --> 23:42.881
What's going on? Here, let me help you.

23:43.674 --> 23:44.675
You all right?

23:44.758 --> 23:46.343
I got it, all right. I got you.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.387
-What happened? You dropped something?
-No.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.265
That's it. Hey, what's this?

23:56.645 --> 23:58.146
Well, who are these guys?

23:59.857 --> 24:00.858
Who's this?

24:01.358 --> 24:02.776
You recognize these guys?

24:05.070 --> 24:06.488
Can you tell me who they are?

24:08.031 --> 24:10.158
It's all right. You just take your time.

24:11.368 --> 24:12.870
Is he putting you to work, Syl?

24:12.953 --> 24:14.788
Nah, he can't afford me.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.999
That's what I like to hear.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.210
What are you working on?

24:21.003 --> 24:22.212
I found this on him.

24:24.381 --> 24:25.465
Who are these guys?

24:25.549 --> 24:27.634
I don't know,
I don't recognize any of 'em.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.513
-Well, this guy looks like Junior.
-Yeah?

24:32.848 --> 24:34.099
Oh, you're right. That--

24:34.183 --> 24:36.518
-That totally is Junior.
-Fishing.

24:37.144 --> 24:38.854
We were fishing. That much I have.

24:38.937 --> 24:41.398
Bet you Junior would know
who the rest of 'em are.

24:41.481 --> 24:45.152
If these guys are all still in town,
we should get 'em all back together.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.613
Right? We can invite 'em over
to the house for lunch.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.990
-Would you like that, Pop?
-Sure, Matty.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.368
Yeah, or maybe a fishing trip
with your old friends?

24:53.452 --> 24:55.913
Once Matt gets the boat
back up and running.

24:55.996 --> 24:59.541
Now, that is actually a great idea.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.043
-Right?
-Yeah.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.669
Okay, put the bed back, boys.

25:02.753 --> 25:04.254
Matty did that.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.089
Really?

25:06.173 --> 25:09.635
Nice. Yeah, way to throw me
under the bus, Pop. Thank you.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.428
-You all right?
-Mm-hmm.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.727
-Hey.
-Hey, Frank.

25:18.810 --> 25:19.811
Hey, how you doing?

25:20.521 --> 25:23.232
Listen, I got a crazy idea.

25:23.315 --> 25:26.068
Would you be interested in helping me
fix up my dad's boat?

25:26.151 --> 25:28.111
You know, the one we hung out on as kids?

25:28.195 --> 25:30.572
Yeah, absolutely.
Endless Summer rides again.

25:30.656 --> 25:33.992
All right. Let me talk to the marina,
and I'll get back to you.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.577
All right. See you later, man.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.163
Hey, Frank.

25:38.247 --> 25:39.998
Hey. How's it going, Martin?

26:42.853 --> 26:44.104
What are you doing here?

26:44.188 --> 26:46.607
What am I-- Talent show rehearsal?

26:46.690 --> 26:49.693
Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied.

26:50.986 --> 26:52.613
Can we talk about this later?

26:54.323 --> 26:55.449
Yeah, so...

26:56.450 --> 26:57.659
What's his talent?

26:57.743 --> 27:00.746
Frank, this is a job interview.

27:00.829 --> 27:01.872
What?

27:01.955 --> 27:04.875
It's just that with everything
that's happened with the PTA,

27:04.958 --> 27:08.837
I've been thinking about transferring
to a different school district

27:08.921 --> 27:11.298
-to get a fresh start.
-I'm sorry.

27:11.798 --> 27:15.469
You're thinking about leaving Erie Harbor?
How could you not tell me that?

27:16.178 --> 27:17.179
You know what?

27:17.930 --> 27:19.097
Don't worry about it.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.225
Because with my mom in prison,

27:21.308 --> 27:24.811
and a cop shaking me down
during my job interview,

27:24.895 --> 27:26.980
I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna get the job.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.649
Problem solved.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.510
You're popular today.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.306
No, definitely not. I--

28:02.724 --> 28:05.936
It's my boyfriend,
the one that lives in San Francisco.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.313
Have you been to visit yet?

28:08.397 --> 28:09.731
No, but I want to.

28:09.815 --> 28:13.151
I keep thinking I should just, like,
bail on this place and go see him.

28:13.235 --> 28:15.112
Except, I can't drive, so...

28:18.991 --> 28:21.159
Does he always blow up
your phone that much?

28:21.243 --> 28:22.244
What?

28:23.829 --> 28:24.830
No.

28:24.913 --> 28:28.333
I mean, we do talk a lot though.
Like, every day, at least.

28:28.417 --> 28:31.128
But he's not controlling or anything,
he's just...

28:32.546 --> 28:33.964
my best friend, I guess.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.340
That's cool.

28:42.639 --> 28:46.602
Okay, I feel like now you think he's
some super intense scary boyfriend,

28:46.685 --> 28:47.686
and he's really not.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.189
Like, he's actually the nicest guy ever,
and I just--

28:50.272 --> 28:51.315
Iz, no.

28:51.398 --> 28:53.525
I don't think anything of him, seriously.

28:53.609 --> 28:55.068
He sounds really great.

29:00.949 --> 29:03.994
It's just scary not knowing
when I'll be able to see him again.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.832
The future is dark,

29:08.916 --> 29:12.211
which is the best thing
the future can be, I think.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.547
What is that? A song lyric or something?

29:16.131 --> 29:17.341
Virginia Woolf.

29:17.841 --> 29:20.928
I read a bunch of her stuff
when my parents were getting divorced.

29:21.011 --> 29:26.058
I think it means that in the darkness
of the unknown, everything is possible.

29:26.141 --> 29:28.310
-I like that.
-Me too.

29:36.485 --> 29:38.195
I remember these guys.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.404
Most of 'em, anyway.

29:40.906 --> 29:43.450
And so how did you guys
all know each other?

29:44.243 --> 29:45.869
It was a mix, I guess.

29:45.953 --> 29:48.163
Some were from here,
went to school together.

29:48.789 --> 29:50.165
A few worked at the plant.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.459
Small town, you know.

29:53.794 --> 29:58.090
Would you mind writing
some of those names down for me?

29:58.173 --> 29:59.842
Yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem.

30:01.009 --> 30:03.428
-Yeah, great.
-Yeah.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.099
What was he like?

30:08.433 --> 30:10.561
-Who?
-My dad.

30:11.603 --> 30:14.606
You see these guys?
Well, they were jokers.

30:15.148 --> 30:17.067
Real loud, always messing around.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.070
But your dad wasn't like that.
He could be more reserved.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.072
That is exactly how he got away with it.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.824
Got away with what?

30:24.783 --> 30:26.076
The pranks.

30:26.159 --> 30:29.746
Your father pulled the most
elaborate pranks I have ever seen.

30:29.830 --> 30:31.707
My dad? What, are you kidding?

30:31.790 --> 30:33.959
Yeah, yeah.
No, he'd plan 'em out for weeks.

30:34.042 --> 30:39.214
He had Alan Filana so convinced
there were bears on this camping trip,

30:39.298 --> 30:42.885
Alan ran out of his tent butt naked
and jumped into the lake.

30:42.968 --> 30:44.178
Oh, come on.

30:44.678 --> 30:47.222
I don't think I've ever seen
grown men laugh that hard.

30:48.098 --> 30:49.099
Wow.

30:49.766 --> 30:54.771
Alan's still in town, I think.
Yeah, I haven't seen him in a while.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.148
You should ask him about it.

30:57.482 --> 31:01.069
But even after 40 years,
I bet he's still pissed at your dad.

31:06.742 --> 31:11.538
Okay, but seriously, I don't have any
amazing interests or passions or whatever.

31:12.206 --> 31:13.749
I refuse to believe that.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.042
What? I don't.

31:15.918 --> 31:18.712
Okay, like,
what kind of things are you into?

31:18.795 --> 31:21.173
No. Dude, that is my point.

31:21.256 --> 31:24.843
I mean, who is Izzy?
Okay, what kind of woman do you wanna be?

31:24.927 --> 31:26.345
-Woman? What?
-Yeah.

31:26.929 --> 31:28.138
No, I don't...

31:28.931 --> 31:29.932
Hey, Iz.

31:30.933 --> 31:34.228
Oh, my God, Ethan. How did you--
How did you get here?

31:35.395 --> 31:39.274
Well, technically, my mom dropped me off,
and then your mom let me in.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.568
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
-I tried to.

31:41.652 --> 31:43.695
I mean,
I called you, what, like, five times?

31:43.779 --> 31:45.572
I sent you a million texts.

31:45.656 --> 31:46.949
I wanted to surprise you.

31:47.032 --> 31:51.119
You said you wanted to see me,
and I wanted to see you, so here I am.

31:53.914 --> 31:56.375
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:56.458 --> 31:59.211
Oh, my God, yeah. Sorry.
Ethan, this is Emma.

31:59.294 --> 32:02.047
Emma, this is my boyfriend, Ethan,
the one I was telling you about.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.257
Nice to meet you.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.509
So, are you gonna be in town for a while?

32:06.093 --> 32:09.888
So, this is actually the real surprise.
My mom got her job back at Strata.

32:09.972 --> 32:13.183
My parents are still figuring it all out
with custody and stuff,

32:13.267 --> 32:16.144
but I'm coming back to school here,
for good.

32:16.228 --> 32:17.479
-Really?
-Yeah.

32:17.563 --> 32:19.648
So I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

32:20.858 --> 32:23.151
I should probably get going,
but you two have fun.

32:25.404 --> 32:26.446
See you around, Ethan.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.242
Yeah, yeah. Definitely.

32:46.508 --> 32:47.509
Can I help you?

32:49.052 --> 32:51.138
Oh, hey. Yeah, sorry to bother you.

32:51.221 --> 32:54.808
I'm Matt Lisko.
I'm looking for Alan Filana.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.435
Does he still live here?

32:56.518 --> 32:59.855
No, sorry.
Well, he passed away a few months ago.

33:00.814 --> 33:03.942
I'm sorry to hear that.
Listen, if this is a bad time,

33:04.026 --> 33:05.569
-I totally understand.
-No. I mean--

33:05.652 --> 33:07.571
-I'd love to talk about him if...
-Yeah?

33:07.654 --> 33:09.031
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you sure?

33:09.114 --> 33:10.824
Really? Okay, great. Great.

33:10.908 --> 33:13.410
Actually,
I'm trying to find some of the guys

33:13.493 --> 33:16.705
in this picture here
for my dad, Sylvester Lisko.

33:16.788 --> 33:19.166
Oh, yeah. That's Syl's Cycles, right?

33:19.249 --> 33:20.250
That's it. That's it.

33:21.502 --> 33:25.506
Yeah, his memory's starting to go,
sadly, so...

33:26.173 --> 33:28.425
Yeah, I thought I'd track down
some of of his old friends.

33:28.509 --> 33:31.512
You know, invite 'em over.
Maybe help him remember some things.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.514
Do you know any of those guys?

33:34.181 --> 33:36.266
Well, I recognize
these two here on the end.

33:36.350 --> 33:38.477
-They played poker together.
-Oh, no way.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.855
Hey, did your dad ever tell you
about that bear prank?

33:41.939 --> 33:43.857
Yeah, I did hear about that. Yeah.

33:43.941 --> 33:45.567
Come on in,
and I'll give you their numbers.

33:45.651 --> 33:47.361
-Yeah? That's great, thank you.
-Yeah.

33:48.779 --> 33:50.697
Look, guys. The door is unlocked.

33:53.867 --> 33:57.454
I do not like this. Not one bit.

33:58.539 --> 34:01.625
Just gotta find a way to get back
in that big, creepy door.

34:02.626 --> 34:04.962
We'll never be able to get
that giant door open.

34:05.546 --> 34:07.005
We need another way in.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.174
Look for this symbol.

34:09.257 --> 34:12.177
If you see it somewhere else,
it could lead us back to the basement.

34:26.483 --> 34:27.693
Guys, look.

34:29.069 --> 34:31.362
I think the secret room
is directly below us.

34:31.446 --> 34:33.574
This could help us
get behind that locked door.

34:36.451 --> 34:37.744
No way.

34:37.828 --> 34:40.496
Oh, come on.
It's not like it's gonna break.

34:40.581 --> 34:43.125
Dumbwaiters are designed
to hold tons of food.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.962
I'm sure there's been a whole turkey
in there that weighs more than we do.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.257
I feel like it's healthy
to set appropriate boundaries

34:50.340 --> 34:53.051
-and not do everything together.
-Mm-hmm.

34:53.135 --> 34:54.136
Fine.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.346
I'll send the dumbwaiter up empty

34:56.429 --> 34:59.266
if there's something
that you should come down and see!

36:04.248 --> 36:07.251
Please don't come up empty.
Please don't come up empty.

36:08.877 --> 36:10.587
-Great.
-Are they done in here?

36:10.671 --> 36:12.589
-Yes, sir. All clear.
-Go!

36:12.673 --> 36:15.551
Fine.
You do your final sweep and then lock up.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.732
I think it's him,
the guy who's been following Hilde.

36:30.816 --> 36:32.693
-We have to warn her.
-Come on.

36:32.776 --> 36:33.861
Go, go.

36:36.697 --> 36:37.739
See you down there.

36:41.118 --> 36:42.619
The guy, he's here.

36:44.413 --> 36:45.414
Guys, look.

36:45.914 --> 36:49.459
How did they get
an entire airplane down here?

36:50.043 --> 36:52.713
Who would put a wrecked airplane
in a basement?

36:52.796 --> 36:55.799
No, no.
Guys, guys, the key card guy is upstairs.

36:55.883 --> 36:58.844
-We need to get out of here.
-Then we need to work fast.

37:09.563 --> 37:12.357
Hi, could I speak to Theo, please?

37:16.069 --> 37:17.279
Oh, really?

37:18.238 --> 37:19.948
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:27.122 --> 37:28.999
Guys, I think I found the black box.

37:29.082 --> 37:31.376
-Are you color-blind?
-No.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.669
Wait, maybe.

37:33.170 --> 37:35.047
-How would I know?
-That isn't black.

37:35.130 --> 37:36.340
Black boxes aren't black.

37:36.423 --> 37:39.718
They're painted orange for investigators
to find them at crash sites.

37:39.801 --> 37:42.888
It's actually called a cockpit
voice recorder, or CVR for short.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.265
Guys, get on with it.

37:46.433 --> 37:49.019
-Someone's coming.
-We need to get out of here.

37:50.187 --> 37:51.605
The dumbwaiter. Let's go.

37:58.779 --> 37:59.780
Go.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.283
Good luck.

38:04.243 --> 38:05.702
Hilde, we gotta hide.

38:06.286 --> 38:09.289
Hi, can I speak to Kenny Rens, please?

38:11.708 --> 38:12.876
Oh, okay.

38:13.961 --> 38:14.962
Yeah, of course.

38:15.045 --> 38:16.463
No, I'm so sorry to hear that.

38:32.563 --> 38:33.981
Our backpacks.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.786
Could I ask how old--

38:48.287 --> 38:49.496
Fifty-seven?

38:50.163 --> 38:51.373
Wow. Yeah.

38:58.714 --> 39:00.174
We gotta get outa here.

39:07.014 --> 39:08.515
Hilde, hurry. Get in.

39:13.854 --> 39:14.855
Hey.

39:16.315 --> 39:17.524
What is it?

39:19.860 --> 39:21.153
They're all dead.

39:22.154 --> 39:23.363
Your dad's friends?

39:24.615 --> 39:25.616
Yeah.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.368
Yeah, all of them.
