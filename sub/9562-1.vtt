'It was a good dream

01:00.702 --> 01:02.108
-my best one.'

01:02.923 --> 01:04.780
'Everything was perfect.'

01:18.256 --> 01:21.969
'My mother was proud
of her son's wings.'

01:26.996 --> 01:30.952
'My half-sister, Meg,
lost her braces.'

01:34.786 --> 01:37.810
'My other half-sister, Gloria,

01:38.543 --> 01:41.396
had realised my
intellectual superiority'

01:42.296 --> 01:44.130
And was quietly
respectful to me.'

02:03.438 --> 02:07.251
'My step-fathers were slaves,
captured in battle.'

02:16.383 --> 02:19.245
'And, there was a
Wac by my side.'

02:19.685 --> 02:21.832
'Not too bright, not too loud.

02:22.419 --> 02:23.974
Hugely attractive.'

02:25.084 --> 02:26.862
'It's a good dream.'

02:27.424 --> 02:31.618
'A John Wayne meets Hugh
Hefner philosophy...

02:32.498 --> 02:35.995
if you consider Hef a
philosopher, or John Wayne.'

02:38.252 --> 02:39.955
'But whatever the dream,

02:41.629 --> 02:44.427
there's always a face
that I can't see...

02:45.532 --> 02:47.489
that I keep missing,

02:49.065 --> 02:51.869
out there beyond the
edge of the crowd.'

03:16.469 --> 03:18.537
'This is WJB Boston.'

03:18.598 --> 03:21.801
'It's 70 degrees on the first
day of summer, 1968...

03:21.862 --> 03:24.882
a good day to be
born a woman...'

03:27.015 --> 03:29.086
Turn it up, I love this song!

03:29.161 --> 03:30.094
It's too loud already.

03:30.155 --> 03:31.054
Turn it up!

03:31.648 --> 03:33.230
Turn it down, Meg.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.089
I like this song, Gloria.

03:35.150 --> 03:36.512
White-trash music.

03:36.573 --> 03:38.295
It's not. It's a good song!

03:38.360 --> 03:40.328
Mother, will you
reason with her?

03:42.069 --> 03:44.331
Mother, I was listening to that!

03:44.392 --> 03:47.210
Meg, don't whine.
It's so unattractive.

03:47.277 --> 03:48.052
Yeah. Really.

03:48.673 --> 03:50.194
It was wearing down the battery.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.447
No, it wasn't.

03:52.207 --> 03:53.609
Batteries can run for
hours like that.

03:54.246 --> 03:55.106
Thank you, Charles.

03:55.605 --> 03:57.631
What a pagan of an
engineer we are Charles.

03:57.692 --> 03:59.966
And I thought it was just
airplanes you specialized in.

04:00.027 --> 04:01.098
Was I talking to you?

04:01.379 --> 04:04.203
Attention please. This is our
pilot, Charles Norstadt.

04:04.265 --> 04:06.375
Yeah, was he talking to you?

04:06.877 --> 04:08.378
Come on, Gloria, spare us.

04:09.234 --> 04:10.886
'It was a good dream.'

04:28.094 --> 04:30.643
Hey Chuck. Did you see that?
They ate right out of my hand!

04:31.519 --> 04:33.811
Chuck? Chuck? Wake up!

04:34.576 --> 04:35.428
All right. All right.

04:35.489 --> 04:36.800
You're doing that thing again.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.057
What thing?

04:38.225 --> 04:40.521
You get that look that Barney
Fife look on your face.

04:40.619 --> 04:41.884
Where do you go
when you do that?

04:42.354 --> 04:44.347
Look, he came this
close to my eyes.

04:51.577 --> 04:52.204
Hi.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.052
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

04:59.457 --> 05:00.373
Are you married?

05:03.165 --> 05:04.473
He's really shy.

05:04.534 --> 05:05.633
You're nuts.

05:06.034 --> 05:07.724
I'm just trying to help Mother.

05:07.784 --> 05:09.119
She doesn't need help.

05:09.782 --> 05:11.266
Marriage is her hobby, like

05:11.913 --> 05:13.311
bridge or pug dog-breeding.

05:14.011 --> 05:15.777
So I wanna make sure
the next guy's nice.

05:16.293 --> 05:18.378
More like my dad than Gloria's.

05:20.054 --> 05:20.873
Or mine.

05:21.533 --> 05:22.704
I didn't say that.

05:23.528 --> 05:24.421
Doesn't matter.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.816
I'm not gonna be here
much longer anyway.

05:27.350 --> 05:28.706
How? You flunked.

05:29.764 --> 05:30.978
I can take the exam again.

05:32.803 --> 05:33.742
What's so funny?

05:33.883 --> 05:35.542
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

05:35.772 --> 05:37.382
Anyway, she'll never let you go.

05:45.357 --> 05:46.080
Look.

05:46.755 --> 05:47.694
Mother, I'm trying to read.

05:47.768 --> 05:48.678
Oh, come on!

05:53.451 --> 05:54.349
Oh!

05:54.835 --> 05:55.867
Isn't it clever? Yes.

05:56.581 --> 05:57.336
What is this?

05:57.592 --> 05:58.176
Mom?

05:59.746 --> 06:00.258
Mother?

06:00.978 --> 06:02.065
What is it, Charles?

06:02.250 --> 06:02.790
What?

06:04.455 --> 06:06.168
I wanna retake the exam.

06:06.973 --> 06:08.473
You've had your chance, Charles.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.273
You know, but I found that I can

06:10.334 --> 06:11.882
take it again at
the end of August.

06:11.943 --> 06:14.841
You know I wasn't happy when you
applied to a boarding school.

06:15.704 --> 06:16.977
It's my dad's school.

06:17.303 --> 06:18.633
You know, that'll convince her.

06:18.762 --> 06:19.279
Shut up!

06:19.880 --> 06:21.832
I don't want you at
a military academy.

06:21.893 --> 06:23.551
They're fascist and unnatural.

06:23.924 --> 06:26.623
Well, there's no risk letting
him take the exam, Mother.

06:26.684 --> 06:28.170
I mean, can you see Charles

06:28.250 --> 06:30.093
cramming Latin and
geometry at the cottage?

06:30.154 --> 06:31.329
Look, I'm already studying!

06:32.788 --> 06:33.405
Mother?

06:33.952 --> 06:35.369
All right, Charles.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.975
If you wanna give up your whole
vacation, you can try again.

06:38.305 --> 06:39.529
No, not the whole summer.

06:40.683 --> 06:43.656
Charles, you know it takes you
longer than most children, right?

06:44.873 --> 06:47.144
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

06:54.304 --> 06:56.766
You're stupid, you're
stupid, you're stupid!

06:58.638 --> 06:59.885
Now you're slow!

07:00.634 --> 07:02.646
You know you're Goober Pyle!

07:34.763 --> 07:36.563
Down, boy! Lie down!

07:40.466 --> 07:41.182
I'm, er...

07:42.789 --> 07:44.226
I'm so... sorry.

07:48.787 --> 07:50.555
You know, this tyre's
been vandalised.

07:50.798 --> 07:51.303
What?

07:51.498 --> 07:53.006
Yeah. Look.

07:53.535 --> 07:55.046
Half a dozen
deliberate punctures.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.010
Oh, look at that.

07:58.501 --> 08:00.943
My God! Who would do
something like that?

08:01.064 --> 08:01.884
That's crazy!

08:02.234 --> 08:03.613
Oh! My God! Come here! Come here!
Come here!.

08:04.793 --> 08:05.343
What?

08:05.404 --> 08:06.477
Look over there.

08:06.882 --> 08:09.150
Isn't that Hamburger-Head?
You know, McLeod?

08:10.531 --> 08:12.501
I thought he never
left his dungeon.

08:13.847 --> 08:16.299
Now don't stare. We're
not at a circus.

08:22.096 --> 08:23.928
'Will I actually
commit the crime?

08:24.658 --> 08:26.534
That is for the coin to decide.'

08:27.445 --> 08:29.576
'Which face will it show?
Which side?

08:30.049 --> 08:32.203
The whole, or the ruined?'

08:33.714 --> 08:34.991
'The coin has decided.

08:35.413 --> 08:37.866
And so, Two-Face must strike...'

08:39.158 --> 08:42.638
'as the bells of Gotham City
ring out into the murky night.'

08:42.698 --> 08:43.575
Charles! Lunch!

08:43.635 --> 08:44.890
Oh, no! Here she comes.

08:45.667 --> 08:46.854
Better get you out of here, Mac.

08:49.566 --> 08:50.133
Shut up.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.069
Charles, what are
you doing here?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.604
I'm studying.

08:56.027 --> 08:58.108
Well, you're not gonna get
lunch in bed. Come on!

09:12.586 --> 09:13.420
Charles!

09:13.945 --> 09:14.548
What?

09:14.609 --> 09:16.237
I told you I don't
want that rabid beast

09:16.298 --> 09:17.786
in the house again.
It isn't safe.

09:18.946 --> 09:20.233
What are you talking about?

09:20.457 --> 09:21.572
I keep Mac outside.

09:22.031 --> 09:23.506
I am in earnest, young man.

09:23.576 --> 09:24.760
Have you seen his cat?

09:25.250 --> 09:26.536
It's so disgusting.

09:26.597 --> 09:27.716
That's enough, Gloria.

09:32.942 --> 09:34.976
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to study.

09:35.037 --> 09:36.253
If you need any help...

09:46.944 --> 09:47.556
Hey, Chad!

09:48.645 --> 09:50.148
Chad. What's that kid's...?
Chuck!

09:50.721 --> 09:52.004
Chuck! Have you seen Gloria?

09:52.103 --> 09:55.825
Er, yeah. She went off with
some guy in a Mustang.

09:58.047 --> 09:58.691
What guy?

09:58.945 --> 10:00.137
I don't know. I mean...

10:00.612 --> 10:01.391
Who's the guy?

10:01.577 --> 10:03.559
I dunno. Just... some guy.

10:04.642 --> 10:05.180
When?

10:05.428 --> 10:06.340
Just now.

10:11.616 --> 10:12.726
Chuck! Wait up!

10:13.881 --> 10:14.468
Jeez!

10:16.617 --> 10:18.109
Hey Chuck, I said wait up!

10:20.355 --> 10:21.994
What are you, my shadow?

10:22.267 --> 10:23.906
Don't compensate by using me

10:23.967 --> 10:25.408
as an emotional punching bag.

10:25.643 --> 10:26.370
Be quiet.

10:26.891 --> 10:28.889
You're too young
to talk like that.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.502
Gloria's right you know.

10:30.628 --> 10:31.080
What?

10:31.141 --> 10:33.007
You're never gonna
pass it on your own.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.078
Shut up!

10:34.332 --> 10:35.831
Why don't you let me tutor you?

10:36.022 --> 10:37.247
You're ten years old!

10:37.351 --> 10:38.743
What's the problem with my age?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.066
You know I'm smart enough.

10:40.270 --> 10:43.807
Okay. You're a genius.
A fender-face genius!

10:44.732 --> 10:47.143
And you're a jerk!
I hope you fail

10:47.204 --> 10:50.331
and I hope you have to live with
us forever and ever and ever.

10:50.962 --> 10:52.634
What are you gonna do, Chuck?

10:52.695 --> 10:54.032
ask Gloria for help?

10:54.631 --> 10:56.949
Come on Chuck. Don't
be such a boy!

11:09.386 --> 11:10.696
Hey, Norstadt!

11:11.604 --> 11:13.762
You're still a virgin!

11:15.926 --> 11:17.955
Catching up on a little
reading, are we, Norstadt?

11:18.272 --> 11:20.829
How do you know that school's over,
or haven't you heard, wing-nut.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.946
Thanks for the
newsflash, brillo-head.

11:24.699 --> 11:25.370
Shut up!

11:25.465 --> 11:26.355
What's goin' on, guys?

11:26.499 --> 11:28.718
Usual. Pearson's got
his old man's boat.

11:28.929 --> 11:31.126
-Where are you gonna swim?
-Freak beach. You want in?

11:32.140 --> 11:33.930
Come on. You up to it?
-Let's go. Come on.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.210
All right. Yeah. Sure.

11:36.116 --> 11:38.222
-Hop in. What are you waitin' for?
-Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

11:39.382 --> 11:40.335
Hey, can I come?

11:40.566 --> 11:43.224
-No way.
-No flat chicks allowed!

11:43.285 --> 11:44.982
Shut up, you sexist pig!

11:45.234 --> 11:48.411
-Whoa, bra-burner!
-Trainer bra-burner!

11:48.472 --> 11:51.197
I'm sure the only bra you'll
ever see is your momma's!

11:56.766 --> 11:57.968
What a stupid world.

11:59.888 --> 12:02.239
It's true we could
divide all chickdom

12:02.537 --> 12:05.040
into Ginger on the one hand and
the Mary-Anne on the other.

12:05.101 --> 12:08.849
But why? But why not let visitors
onto this island paradise?

12:09.054 --> 12:12.192
Guest stars. Top of
the list, Agent 99.

12:12.253 --> 12:15.117
-Agent 99 sucks.
-Bewitched would be good.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.661
Bewitched is married.

12:16.794 --> 12:18.901
-So what?
-He'd probably do it with Mrs. Howell.

12:22.716 --> 12:24.133
You guys ever seen the Freak?

12:24.194 --> 12:27.831
McLeod? No. He won't
let you see him. Not up close.

12:28.011 --> 12:29.352
-I saw him.
-Oh, screw you!

12:29.413 --> 12:30.922
Oh, shut up, Norstadt.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.721
No, I saw him. I saw
him on the ferry!

12:32.782 --> 12:35.186
Why would Hamburger-Head go on
the boat with normal people?

12:35.406 --> 12:37.886
Not like Norma. He
travelled below.

12:38.689 --> 12:40.418
The Hound from
Hell was with him.

12:40.691 --> 12:41.436
His wolf?

12:41.685 --> 12:42.537
Get this.

12:42.598 --> 12:44.264
The Freak was this close to me.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.995
But, why would the
Freak go to Boston?

12:46.255 --> 12:47.593
Mafia meeting, probably.

12:47.747 --> 12:49.055
-Porno.
-What?

12:49.637 --> 12:50.605
He writes porno books.

12:50.666 --> 12:51.717
Get outta here!

12:51.824 --> 12:52.504
It' true.

12:52.565 --> 12:55.403
He gets parcels in the Post Office
from New York porn publishers.

12:55.736 --> 12:57.714
How's a freak like that gonna write porno?

12:57.813 --> 12:58.723
What would he write about?

12:59.145 --> 12:59.893
I don't know.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.891
Hey. Maybe his dog!

13:04.343 --> 13:06.609
Shh! Dog! Wait. Did
you hear that?

13:08.417 --> 13:09.580
-What?
-Listen...

13:11.193 --> 13:12.033
What was that?

13:14.507 --> 13:15.074
Jut get in.

13:16.524 --> 13:17.420
Ow, my finger!

13:24.890 --> 13:27.034
-Wait up, guys!
-Come on, Norstadt!

13:27.299 --> 13:27.932
Come on.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.826
Start the motor! Come on!

13:43.034 --> 13:46.631
-Boy, was that close!
-Jeez! Was that a wolf?

13:47.157 --> 13:48.667
Did you see the Freak
up there, man?

13:49.649 --> 13:52.798
He was scared of the wolf.
He was pissin' in his pants!

13:54.690 --> 13:55.894
We gotta go back!

13:58.412 --> 14:01.432
I left my books there! Come on!
I left my books!

14:01.493 --> 14:02.472
We gotta go back!

14:02.765 --> 14:04.260
Tell the school the dog ate 'em.

14:05.815 --> 14:07.986
What subject was it, anyway.
Latin?

14:08.263 --> 14:10.770
Screw-us you-us! We're
not going back.

14:10.996 --> 14:12.835
See ya later, pizza-head!

14:59.069 --> 15:00.651
If he's a cannibal,

15:01.458 --> 15:03.436
I'll just tell him I
have bone cancer.

15:27.023 --> 15:28.672
'I don't know what to do
with him when he gets that

15:29.735 --> 15:32.839
that expression... that stupid look on his
face.'

15:33.873 --> 15:35.957
'What do you see in the
ink blot, Charles?'

15:36.316 --> 15:38.788
'Charles, what do you
think I mean by the term

15:38.982 --> 15:40.106
'passive aggressive'?'

15:40.826 --> 15:42.676
'Hell, he's his father's
son all right.'

15:43.298 --> 15:47.514
'Eric was my third husband and
my one real mistake in him.'

15:48.452 --> 15:50.185
I'm sure that's
very funny, Charles.

15:50.735 --> 15:51.851
Now, what do you really see?'

15:52.956 --> 15:56.009
'Truth is Charles, you don't care
about anybody but yourself.'

15:56.699 --> 15:58.832
'What do you see in the
ink blot, Charles?'

16:00.436 --> 16:01.445
John Wayne.

16:06.317 --> 16:07.320
What are you doing here?

16:14.451 --> 16:15.345
What's wrong with you?

16:15.406 --> 16:17.252
Have you got any idea how
long you been here?

17:18.769 --> 17:20.094
S... sorry.

17:20.825 --> 17:23.083
It just went off.
It's a pretty funny clock.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.826
Funny 'ha-ha', funny strange?

17:29.460 --> 17:30.306
Not sure.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.283
Says you taught at, erm,

17:35.519 --> 17:36.624
Barrett Academy.

17:37.993 --> 17:38.823
Is that a good school?

17:41.936 --> 17:42.807
What do you teach?

17:43.162 --> 17:43.929
What's your name?

17:44.074 --> 17:46.734
Erm, Chuck. Chuck Norstadt.

17:47.737 --> 17:50.207
Well, Chuck Chuck Norstadt,
where do you live?

17:51.721 --> 17:54.062
Just on the other side
of the harbour.

17:57.203 --> 17:58.715
Then you'd better
drink this and go.

18:00.574 --> 18:02.807
Oh, great. Thanks.

18:03.317 --> 18:04.854
Come on, Mickey. Heel.

18:11.244 --> 18:13.591
Mickey really doesn't seem
the right name for your dog.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.716
It's kinda like naming
Godzilla 'Bambi', huh?

18:22.188 --> 18:24.461
You name him after Mickey
Metal or Mickey Mouse?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.815
How's your mother's front tyre?

18:29.395 --> 18:29.841
Fine.

18:31.926 --> 18:32.872
It's a bright night.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.836
You should be able to find
your way home, shouldn't you?

18:36.275 --> 18:37.418
Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah.

18:37.479 --> 18:38.980
You found your way
here, didn't you?

18:39.926 --> 18:40.435
Mm-hm.

18:40.638 --> 18:41.265
Mm-hm.

18:48.465 --> 18:49.356
It's my bike.

18:53.681 --> 18:56.130
Hey, you still do any teaching, at all?

18:57.458 --> 18:58.645
Reason I ask is...

18:59.138 --> 19:02.134
This may sound crazy, but if
you're still in the business,

19:02.195 --> 19:04.523
I could really use
some help on an exam.

19:05.065 --> 19:07.960
-Why does that sound crazy?
-I don't know,

19:08.255 --> 19:11.142
It's just that I've never
thought of you as a teacher.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.291
Nobody does.

19:13.787 --> 19:16.491
Not that I know anything
about you or anything.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.170
It won't take a lot of time.

19:19.238 --> 19:21.986
It's just to get into this
second-rate boarding school.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.309
Misunderstood, are we?

19:25.048 --> 19:29.173
No. I'm just sick of
living with three females,

19:29.247 --> 19:32.058
all brilliant, and being
the family retard.

19:32.433 --> 19:33.075
I see.

19:34.852 --> 19:37.572
Nothing at all to do with
pre-pubescent angst, then?

19:39.851 --> 19:41.628
It was the school
my father went to.

19:42.852 --> 19:46.442
He was in Korea, then he...
he died in a jet crash.

19:47.427 --> 19:49.762
Some kind of
experimental spy plane.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.654
If it's a matter of
money, I can pay you.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.955
No, I don't think you can.

19:59.770 --> 20:01.389
Nice to have met you, Mr.
McLeod.

20:03.374 --> 20:04.274
Bucket-head.

20:07.241 --> 20:11.208
There's Great Grandfather MacNeil.
He built the cottage.

20:11.561 --> 20:12.352
Far out.

20:12.932 --> 20:15.531
Oh, look at those
Presbyterian eyes.

20:15.592 --> 20:17.884
Ooh, terrifying!

20:19.168 --> 20:22.825
Oh, but I can't believe you're
interested in all this ancient history.

20:22.886 --> 20:24.628
No. I am, it's all research.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.220
All for my book on the
Robber Baringer mine shaft.

20:29.113 --> 20:32.122
That is such an important topic.

20:32.429 --> 20:35.978
Have I told you that it looks like Mark
Hughes is gonna write the foreword.

20:36.039 --> 20:37.531
Oh. Mark Hughes?

20:38.079 --> 20:40.126
Oh. Oh Charles!

20:41.756 --> 20:42.982
Charles? Come here, dear.

20:43.227 --> 20:43.722
Hi, man.

20:44.305 --> 20:45.663
I want you to meet

20:45.973 --> 20:48.981
Professor Hartley of Yale.
This is my son, Charles.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.407
Just call me Carl.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.007
I don't need any of that
Imperialistic Post Hegalian

20:53.081 --> 20:55.087
authoritarian crap for my ego.

20:57.827 --> 20:59.854
Hi... Carl.

21:01.158 --> 21:05.381
She hasn't caught a fish,
she's vacuumed up a hairball!

21:06.480 --> 21:07.100
Hi, Chuck.

21:10.598 --> 21:12.095
Go put some dry clothes on.

21:15.072 --> 21:15.795
Good night.

21:34.409 --> 21:35.627
'Arms, I sing.

21:36.825 --> 21:37.706
I am the man...

21:39.576 --> 21:42.350
'who first from the
shores of Troy came.'

21:44.566 --> 21:46.597
'Fate exiled to Italy

21:47.523 --> 21:49.244
and her Lovinian strand...'

21:52.179 --> 21:55.434
'..much buffeted he,
on flood and field,

21:56.414 --> 21:57.971
by constraint of heaven...'

21:58.975 --> 22:01.367
'and Juno's unslumbering wrath.'

23:01.988 --> 23:05.708
Hi, Mickey. Aren't you the
ugliest son of a bitch?

23:06.976 --> 23:08.394
If I had a dog like you,

23:09.277 --> 23:10.943
I'd put a bag over its head.

23:11.004 --> 23:15.315
Yes, I would, you flea-infested
sack of worms...

23:18.953 --> 23:19.687
How you doin'?

23:24.788 --> 23:25.923
Beautiful day, isn't it?

23:37.416 --> 23:38.109
Um...

23:39.316 --> 23:40.070
I'm here.

23:44.451 --> 23:47.753
I know you're pressed for
time and everything...

23:47.979 --> 23:49.837
but, you know, I was wondering,

23:51.400 --> 23:53.553
maybe you'd be
interested in some

23:54.083 --> 23:56.638
some... some...
Latin exercises...

23:56.913 --> 23:59.217
just to look over 'em.

24:06.032 --> 24:08.770
I realise you're busy,
Mr. McLeod...

24:09.457 --> 24:13.021
but how much work is a
couple of Latin passages?

24:13.666 --> 24:15.682
Maybe a little geometry?

24:24.910 --> 24:25.839
I'd like a hole.

24:27.282 --> 24:28.642
I don't understand.

24:28.993 --> 24:31.769
Three feet, cubed. Right here.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.124
Stay.

24:39.304 --> 24:41.917
Listen, I said I could
pay you, didn't I?

24:44.813 --> 24:45.524
Three feet cubed.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.423
Hello!

25:05.382 --> 25:06.493
Mr. McLeod?

25:07.666 --> 25:08.661
You can sit here.

25:19.363 --> 25:21.988
Now, I'd like you
to write an essay.

25:22.532 --> 25:23.723
Any topic you'd like.

25:24.259 --> 25:26.721
Why? It's not on the exam.

25:27.916 --> 25:28.931
Why did you come here?

25:31.472 --> 25:33.404
Quickly! Don't think, just answer.
Why?

25:33.944 --> 25:35.962
For some help. You know.

25:36.088 --> 25:36.971
No. I don't know.

25:37.156 --> 25:38.152
Do you want help or not?

25:38.253 --> 25:40.751
Yeah. I guess so, if
you're really a teacher.

25:40.812 --> 25:42.776
Yeah, I guess so... sir.

25:44.035 --> 25:45.976
Yes. I guess so, sir.

25:46.286 --> 25:46.790
Good.

25:47.919 --> 25:49.090
This is the way it works...

25:50.020 --> 25:51.801
adisca alt disceda.

25:52.665 --> 25:53.604
Learn or leave.

25:54.403 --> 25:56.824
Because it's of no consequence
to me one way or the other.

25:57.221 --> 25:57.861
Understood?

25:58.503 --> 25:59.099
Yeah.

26:00.174 --> 26:03.462
All, except the part about
digging these shit house holes

26:03.567 --> 26:05.710
and writing bullshit.

26:07.472 --> 26:08.868
I haven't got a lot of pity.

26:10.933 --> 26:11.714
You can go now.

26:19.969 --> 26:23.423
Pity yourself, freak!
Stupid freak!

26:41.202 --> 26:41.948
Want one?

26:42.960 --> 26:43.887
No, thanks.

26:44.630 --> 26:46.200
According to my sources,

26:46.280 --> 26:48.985
he was a mad professor
like Carl here.

26:49.378 --> 26:50.405
'Dr McLeod'

26:51.083 --> 26:52.571
Must be a Harvard man.

26:53.103 --> 26:53.762
No doubt.

26:53.881 --> 26:54.501
Martini?

26:54.562 --> 26:55.761
Martini? Thank you.

26:55.930 --> 26:59.649
Anyway, it was a classic
case of murder-suicide.

26:59.770 --> 27:02.409
Butchered his wife, but
botched the job on himself.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.018
Go ask Gus the barber,
if you don't believe me.

27:06.550 --> 27:08.118
That's not what Gus told me.

27:08.676 --> 27:10.194
When you were getting
your hair cut?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.236
He told me he didn't
kill his wife,

27:13.784 --> 27:14.958
he killed his boyfriend.

27:15.117 --> 27:16.612
Carl!

27:17.715 --> 27:21.960
Oh what I wanna know what he
thinks plastic surgery is for.

27:22.232 --> 27:23.785
Unless he doesn't
have the money.

27:24.022 --> 27:25.228
You know, someone told me,

27:25.289 --> 27:27.175
and I assure you, I
do not believe this,

27:27.236 --> 27:30.908
but they said they were sure
he was one of the Kennedys.

27:30.997 --> 27:34.176
The Kennedys? Well, he
certainly resembles one.

27:35.252 --> 27:38.033
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

27:38.094 --> 27:40.472
That's the trashiest thing. I
can't believe you said that.

27:40.942 --> 27:44.209
Becky. Becky, how many years
has McLeod been here?

27:44.366 --> 27:45.708
Six... no, seven.

27:45.896 --> 27:46.883
Seven years.

27:46.997 --> 27:49.234
Every damn summer we end
up talking about him.

27:49.295 --> 27:49.955
So?

27:50.107 --> 27:51.377
So, one of these days,
I'm gonna go off

27:51.438 --> 27:53.218
and gonna knock on his door
and I'm gonna end all this.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.204
Over rotten history.

27:54.723 --> 27:57.517
Oh, Todd, what would
be the fun in that?

27:57.578 --> 27:59.911
Hey, how's the scholar doin'?

28:01.430 --> 28:03.517
Gonna make it to West
Point yet, are we?

28:03.782 --> 28:06.184
Oh, Todd. Don't remind me.

28:06.245 --> 28:07.502
You know how I hate the idea

28:07.563 --> 28:10.110
of him becoming one of
those brush-cut fly boys.

28:10.262 --> 28:12.983
Come on, Catherine,
you like to fly.

28:14.513 --> 28:16.300
I like to have the
garbage picked up too,

28:16.361 --> 28:18.800
but that doesn't mean I want him
driving a sanitation truck.

28:18.868 --> 28:21.200
Kitty, you know this
whole air force bit

28:21.261 --> 28:24.026
is something Chuck's just
into for the moment.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.254
Once he understands
what the Pentagon

28:26.322 --> 28:28.131
is really doing over
there in Vietnam...

28:28.192 --> 28:30.008
Are we having this
argument again?

28:30.859 --> 28:33.240
No, we're not. Because
I'm talking to Kitty.

28:33.915 --> 28:35.249
Besides, I'm too drunk.

28:36.407 --> 28:38.746
I'm just glad he's way
too young for the draft.

28:40.330 --> 28:41.609
Uh, you know, actually,

28:42.113 --> 28:44.430
there's nothing I can think
of that I'd rather do than

28:45.123 --> 28:46.505
drop napalm for a living.

28:54.879 --> 28:57.970
I... Are you gonna let that...?

28:58.031 --> 28:58.832
Television.

29:13.115 --> 29:15.023
Mine's vodka.
What's your excuse?

29:17.092 --> 29:19.438
You gonna marry the hair...
Er...

29:19.896 --> 29:20.655
Carl?

29:22.139 --> 29:23.755
I don't know, Charles.
What do you think?

29:23.816 --> 29:24.788
Do you think I should?

29:28.822 --> 29:31.122
Your mother's not much use
to you these days, is she?

29:33.291 --> 29:34.483
Well, I'm sorry Charles.

29:34.554 --> 29:36.856
But I'm just not cut out
for this mothering racket.

29:37.807 --> 29:40.291
God knows, I never expected
to have three children,

29:41.364 --> 29:43.169
let alone by three
different husbands.

29:44.659 --> 29:45.987
Can I ask you something?

29:47.053 --> 29:47.735
Sure.

29:48.059 --> 29:50.437
Look... you promise not to get mad?

29:50.937 --> 29:51.686
Charles.

29:53.507 --> 29:54.847
Why does Gloria hate me?

29:56.392 --> 29:58.491
Oh, Charles, she doesn't ha...

30:01.999 --> 30:03.275
Because you were born, baby.

30:04.434 --> 30:06.211
But that wasn't my fault.

30:06.795 --> 30:09.195
Oh no, but she didn't know that.

30:11.411 --> 30:13.794
She was four years old.
All she knew was

30:13.863 --> 30:16.063
she had a rival for your
father's affection.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.317
My father. She hated my father.

30:18.378 --> 30:20.489
She's always telling
me what a jerk he was.

30:21.681 --> 30:22.723
The way you do.

30:22.842 --> 30:24.522
Oh, Charles,

30:26.351 --> 30:27.771
I never meant that.

30:28.698 --> 30:30.355
I just didn't know how to...

30:31.775 --> 30:32.802
Morning, all.

30:40.019 --> 30:41.873
About who? Who are
we talking about?

30:44.055 --> 30:44.935
Charles' father.

30:45.917 --> 30:46.761
Oh, yes?

31:21.033 --> 31:21.816
Whoa.

31:25.835 --> 31:27.091
Is this what you wanted?

31:30.310 --> 31:32.905
'Why the system must
be changed now!'

31:33.235 --> 31:34.241
Exclamation point.

31:34.814 --> 31:36.052
'By Charles E Norstadt.'

31:38.485 --> 31:39.847
I had no idea you pondered

31:39.908 --> 31:41.832
such weighty issues, Charles E.

31:42.188 --> 31:43.729
I did what you asked.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.603
Now, are you gonna keep up your end?
Or what?

31:47.390 --> 31:47.955
All right.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.006
I'd like a hole.

31:51.862 --> 31:53.746
Three feet across,
three feet deep.

31:54.137 --> 31:55.938
And, while you're at it,
how about a triangle?

31:56.394 --> 31:57.556
Two by two by three.

31:58.989 --> 31:59.728
Three feet deep.

32:00.106 --> 32:01.562
Just near the paddock,
left of the entrance.

32:01.910 --> 32:04.448
Look, if you need a hole,
hire a contractor.

32:05.108 --> 32:05.844
I don't need a hole.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.892
I'm interested in your title.

32:16.704 --> 32:18.529
I was wondering how you
came to choose it.

32:20.994 --> 32:25.737
Erm, it's about how... how
people have to change things.

32:26.323 --> 32:27.910
What kind of things? Sit down.

32:30.134 --> 32:31.049
What kind of things?

32:31.685 --> 32:32.941
The Government, you know.

32:34.123 --> 32:35.938
And what would you change
about the Government?

32:38.139 --> 32:39.115
Me? Erm,

32:40.314 --> 32:41.243
lots of things.

32:41.337 --> 32:42.055
Such as?

32:43.988 --> 32:45.336
Such... such as...

32:45.786 --> 32:47.895
Such as how the word
is spelt, for example.

32:49.411 --> 32:50.130
What?

32:51.650 --> 32:52.952
Judging by your essay,

32:53.812 --> 32:56.497
looks as if you hope to change the
spelling of the word 'government',

32:57.286 --> 33:00.318
'democracy'... and
'Richard Miltown Nixon'.

33:00.669 --> 33:02.512
So, I'm not too
good at spellings.

33:02.573 --> 33:04.934
Oh, I can see that, but if
you're going to plagiarise,

33:05.024 --> 33:07.214
you might at least show
the courtesy of copying...

33:07.288 --> 33:08.122
What are you talking about?

33:08.183 --> 33:11.388
Don't! Who wrote this? Who?

33:13.095 --> 33:14.045
Bill Garfield.

33:14.902 --> 33:15.634
Never heard of him.

33:16.153 --> 33:17.117
He's at Colombia.

33:18.871 --> 33:21.916
Oh, so you're a
high-class cheat.

33:22.762 --> 33:24.271
-I'm not a cheat...
-Yes, you are!

33:24.946 --> 33:26.675
I hate writing. It sucks!

33:26.736 --> 33:28.055
Adisca alt disceda.

33:28.163 --> 33:31.753
It's a waste of time! It's like
digging those shitty holes!

33:51.710 --> 33:53.206
I'll write you a stinkin' essay!

34:25.607 --> 34:28.011
'Why Spiderman sucks worse

34:28.072 --> 34:31.257
than the Silver Surfer!'
Exclamation point. Very good.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.587
Are you happy now? Can I go?

34:34.116 --> 34:35.219
You invited yourself.

34:38.358 --> 34:41.911
Tonight, I want you
to look up ten

34:41.972 --> 34:43.859
alternatives for the
slang 'to suck'

34:44.757 --> 34:45.699
Shit!

34:46.954 --> 34:48.469
And find me the Latin equivalent

34:48.531 --> 34:49.460
of your other favourite

34:49.521 --> 34:50.358
descriptive.

34:52.752 --> 34:53.282
Mickey!

35:01.790 --> 35:02.390
I gotta go.

35:32.317 --> 35:33.764
I followed you this morning.

35:38.271 --> 35:38.936
You tell,

35:40.341 --> 35:41.258
and you're dead.

35:41.709 --> 35:42.929
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

35:44.087 --> 35:46.063
I'm not gonna tell anybody, if...

35:47.650 --> 35:48.859
What? If what?

35:49.090 --> 35:50.241
You tell me all about him,

35:50.302 --> 35:51.977
starting with what you
were doing there?

35:52.993 --> 35:55.098
You swear. Swear by Thor.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.515
I did what you said.
I got a tutor.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.680
The Freak's a teacher? Come on!

36:03.741 --> 36:06.715
-I think he is, actually.
-What does he teach?

36:07.367 --> 36:10.056
He makes me dig holes.

36:10.538 --> 36:12.795
You liar! Oh my god,
you're such a lair.

36:12.856 --> 36:15.230
I'm gonna tell Mom, and she'll
never let you near him again!

36:15.291 --> 36:16.226
She can see the psycho.

36:16.287 --> 36:18.045
Keep your mouth shut, all right?

36:18.106 --> 36:20.844
Okay! Fine. Get off me, you maniac!

36:21.975 --> 36:24.464
What's he like? Do you like him?
Does he like you?

36:24.525 --> 36:25.430
He hates everybody.

36:26.533 --> 36:27.799
I mean, look at him.

36:28.309 --> 36:31.674
Sometimes I think I'm gonna
be sick, just watching him.

36:32.132 --> 36:34.589
Let me come with you. Please!

36:35.263 --> 36:36.043
Come on, Chuck.

36:47.299 --> 36:48.683
Lunatic!

36:53.301 --> 36:54.051
Hello?

36:57.011 --> 36:57.975
Mr. McLeod?

37:02.141 --> 37:03.094
Sir?

37:08.741 --> 37:10.931
Hey, Pukehead! You home?

37:13.970 --> 37:14.673
Guess not.

38:42.979 --> 38:43.739
Porno.

38:55.329 --> 38:57.122
Take it easy. Okay.

38:58.406 --> 38:59.152
Lie down.

39:02.118 --> 39:04.104
I'll be right back, fella. Okay?

40:04.142 --> 40:05.759
Hey, when did you get back?

40:06.967 --> 40:08.583
I went for a walk when I
finished my homework.

40:11.663 --> 40:12.967
Jeez, what happened to him?

40:13.496 --> 40:14.848
He encountered a porcupine.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.730
Oh! Excrementum!

40:18.852 --> 40:20.152
Stiltus puer.

40:20.656 --> 40:22.806
What? What does that mean?

40:23.133 --> 40:24.088
'The foolish boy'...

40:24.922 --> 40:26.904
digs a three-foot hole.

40:28.470 --> 40:29.544
If we assume

40:29.924 --> 40:31.794
that he has dug his
cube properly...

40:32.839 --> 40:35.466
what will be the volume if
he fills up half of it?

40:41.445 --> 40:43.900
Now, the stiltus
puer wants to erect

40:43.961 --> 40:45.713
a pole at the centre
of his circle.

40:47.267 --> 40:48.427
But how does he
find that centre?

40:50.168 --> 40:51.332
Think, Norstadt, reason.

40:52.545 --> 40:54.553
No? Write this down.

40:55.113 --> 40:57.682
Draw a circle. A, B, C.

41:01.028 --> 41:03.077
Draw within it any
straight line, AB.

41:03.691 --> 41:06.124
Now, bisect AB at D

41:06.944 --> 41:10.526
and draw a straight line,
DC, at right angles to AB.

41:10.780 --> 41:11.686
is that fine, Norstadt?

41:12.084 --> 41:12.866
Yes, sir.

41:13.257 --> 41:16.525
Okay. Any other straight line...
AC.

41:17.034 --> 41:20.671
Bisect AC, and you get the
centre of your circle.

41:23.763 --> 41:24.318
Good.

41:33.253 --> 41:36.665
Euclid's Proposition 47. Now,
this is the famous one, Norstadt.

41:39.315 --> 41:41.401
In any right-angled
triangle, okay...

41:45.156 --> 41:47.271
Have a good look.
Get it over with.

41:47.561 --> 41:49.652
Then we'll continue. Enough?

41:53.049 --> 41:53.514
Good.

41:55.007 --> 41:56.655
In any right-angled triangle,

41:57.073 --> 41:58.887
the square which is described

41:59.232 --> 42:02.392
on the side subtending the
right angle, is equal to...

42:02.834 --> 42:03.526
equal to, what?

42:04.314 --> 42:06.641
It's equal to the sum of the squares
on each of the two sides, sir.

42:07.770 --> 42:08.298
Thank you.

42:11.441 --> 42:12.614
Take away the moustache,

42:13.331 --> 42:14.281
lighten the hair...

42:15.049 --> 42:15.771
McLeod?

42:16.676 --> 42:18.745
Well, don't you think the
picture should include

42:18.813 --> 42:21.158
a little detail that
the man has no face?

42:21.532 --> 42:23.232
You don't know what
they keep back.

42:23.703 --> 42:24.784
Give it a rest, Sam.

42:25.767 --> 42:28.419
Last week you thought
it was Fidel Castro.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.819
I said take away the beard.

42:29.880 --> 42:30.582
How's that, Wayne?

42:31.683 --> 42:34.868
Oh! Very nice, Gus.

42:35.206 --> 42:37.066
Well, I'll tell you
what you want Wayne,

42:37.513 --> 42:40.135
but nobody lives like that
unless they've got history.

42:40.662 --> 42:42.351
Well now, whose
business is that?

42:43.135 --> 42:46.618
This man has not bothered a
soul since he's been here.

42:47.797 --> 42:49.271
Any reason why you
think he would?

42:51.366 --> 42:52.721
Some other haircut.

43:00.818 --> 43:03.927
'Strange fits of
passion have I known'

43:04.448 --> 43:08.059
'and I will dare to tell but
in the lover's ear alone'

43:08.891 --> 43:10.190
'What once to me befell, '

43:10.251 --> 43:13.117
'when she I loved looked every
day fresh as a rose in June...'

43:13.334 --> 43:14.960
'I do acknowledge
with my eyes...'

43:15.021 --> 43:16.107
Ta-dum, ta-dum, ta...

43:16.168 --> 43:19.007
Don't! Please, don't bludgeon
it completely, Norstadt.

43:19.375 --> 43:20.578
I hate poetry!

43:21.039 --> 43:23.192
It's all love this, love that.

43:23.452 --> 43:26.658
It's boring,
snoring, smothering.

43:27.775 --> 43:30.005
You don't like poetry or

43:30.558 --> 43:31.728
you don't like the word 'love'?

43:34.643 --> 43:36.299
Not every poem's a love sonnet.

43:37.788 --> 43:40.100
There's the 'Ode
to my Goldfish'.

43:41.316 --> 43:42.856
'Oh, wet pet'.

43:44.261 --> 43:44.913
That's it?

43:45.237 --> 43:45.818
That's it.

43:46.513 --> 43:48.699
What kind of a plane did
you say your father flew?

43:50.216 --> 43:51.036
U-2

43:54.419 --> 43:57.239
157. Take it home and read it.

43:58.543 --> 43:59.308
Go ahead. Take it.

43:59.726 --> 44:01.942
It's all of 20 lines. I'm
sure you can manage that.

44:21.044 --> 44:21.676
Hey!

44:22.721 --> 44:24.240
Oh, Chuck.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.711
You know my kid
brother, don't you?

44:28.150 --> 44:29.129
I guessed, yes.

44:29.221 --> 44:29.828
Hey.

44:30.196 --> 44:31.579
Were you on 'The Flintstones'?

44:31.640 --> 44:32.259
What?

44:32.320 --> 44:34.417
You know... Fred, Dino.

44:34.764 --> 44:36.769
You know... yabadabadoo?

44:37.835 --> 44:40.833
That's funny. Good. Funny kid.

44:42.324 --> 44:42.878
Let's eat.

44:42.939 --> 44:45.232
Oh. You sit down.
I'll find something.

44:47.700 --> 44:48.829
What have we got here?

44:54.695 --> 44:56.100
What have you got in
your sandwich, Chuck?

44:56.439 --> 44:58.485
What? You wanna give
him my sandwich?

44:59.311 --> 45:00.226
Calm down.

45:01.382 --> 45:02.479
What's this, poetry?

45:02.540 --> 45:03.500
Leave it alone.

45:04.264 --> 45:06.537
You stupid brat! You
did that on purpose!

45:07.076 --> 45:08.675
Jesus! Gloria. Take it...
take it easy!

45:08.762 --> 45:12.055
Shut up, Douglas!
Come down, Slime!

45:12.199 --> 45:13.171
What are you hiding?

45:13.671 --> 45:15.850
Idiot Charles doesn't
read poetry!

45:16.209 --> 45:17.433
It's just a little spilled milk.

45:21.553 --> 45:24.872
'Oh, I have slipped the
surly bonds of earth.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.443
'And danced the skies on
laughter's silvered wings.

45:30.991 --> 45:32.580
'Sunward I've climbed,

45:33.140 --> 45:36.683
joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds.

45:37.118 --> 45:40.655
'And done a hundred things
you have not dreamed of.

45:41.953 --> 45:44.490
'Wheeled and soared and swung,

45:44.904 --> 45:47.711
'and while with silent
lifting mind I have trod

45:48.315 --> 45:51.289
'the high, untrespassed
sanctity of space,

45:51.692 --> 45:55.528
'put out my hand, and
touched the face of God.'

46:11.102 --> 46:11.900
That's promptness.

46:15.165 --> 46:16.773
I didn't need that back today.

46:17.308 --> 46:20.446
No, it was good. I just
thought I should return it.

46:21.553 --> 46:22.143
Why?

46:23.285 --> 46:25.122
Well, remember I told
you about Gloria?

46:25.375 --> 46:27.249
-Your sister?
-My half-sister.

46:27.933 --> 46:30.032
Oh, what's evil
half-sister done now?

46:31.720 --> 46:33.064
Speak up, Norstadt. I've
got an egg boiling.

46:33.702 --> 46:34.737
She saw the book.

46:35.863 --> 46:38.356
She'll snoop around till she
finds out what I'm doing.

46:38.811 --> 46:39.666
I don't follow.

46:43.060 --> 46:44.273
You haven't told your
mother that you're

46:44.334 --> 46:45.810
coming here to be
tutored, have you?

46:46.132 --> 46:46.776
That's it, isn't it?

46:48.816 --> 46:49.929
Why the blazes not?

46:50.722 --> 46:52.370
If I did, she
wouldn't let me come.

46:52.780 --> 46:54.389
It's quite simple.
Then you can't come.

46:54.504 --> 46:56.842
No! I've got to, just for
a little while longer!

46:57.202 --> 46:59.100
Look, if she's letting
you take the exam,

46:59.161 --> 47:00.745
she's not totally
opposed to the idea

47:00.806 --> 47:02.053
of a boarding
school now, is she?

47:05.009 --> 47:07.564
She won't let me come
because it's you.

47:09.185 --> 47:10.143
That's why.

47:11.113 --> 47:14.124
They don't know you. People are
afraid of what they don't know.

47:14.860 --> 47:17.503
Thank you, Herr Doctor, I must
be sure to write that down.

47:17.923 --> 47:19.161
Oh look. I just meant...

47:19.222 --> 47:19.888
What are you playing at?

47:20.242 --> 47:22.126
Nothing. Nobody has to know!

47:23.426 --> 47:24.513
Do you want this exam?

47:28.349 --> 47:28.850
Good.

47:30.300 --> 47:32.838
Then start taking some
responsibility for what you want.

47:34.717 --> 47:36.598
Talk to her, Norstadt,
convince her.

47:38.747 --> 47:39.488
Convince me.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.433
'Mother, I could
not believe it.'

47:59.236 --> 48:01.028
Attacked in my own home.

48:01.100 --> 48:01.879
Oh, Gloria.

48:01.940 --> 48:03.278
NO. I'm not exaggerating.

48:05.012 --> 48:06.193
Why do you baby him?

48:06.808 --> 48:08.243
Is it not what the
psychiatrist said.

48:08.388 --> 48:10.241
You know what his father was.

48:10.302 --> 48:11.885
Mother, I was there.

48:12.324 --> 48:14.062
Well, then you should
be more patient.

48:14.949 --> 48:17.016
Why? He's not the only
one with bad dreams.

48:17.899 --> 48:19.451
It's not the same.

48:23.508 --> 48:25.311
Charles, what are you doing?

48:25.939 --> 48:26.974
I've just got home.

48:27.984 --> 48:28.524
Oh.

48:30.568 --> 48:32.357
Well, is there
something you wanted?

48:32.695 --> 48:33.198
No.

48:38.555 --> 48:39.385
Did he hear us?

48:41.233 --> 48:41.937
I dunno.

48:44.690 --> 48:45.481
Hey, Mickey.

48:46.488 --> 48:47.540
Hey. Good morning.

48:47.915 --> 48:48.509
Morning.

48:53.075 --> 48:53.943
What's all this?

48:55.055 --> 48:58.508
Oh. Um... well, my mother
said I had to pay my way

48:58.635 --> 48:59.936
if I was going to
keep coming here.

49:00.602 --> 49:01.249
Well...

49:02.015 --> 49:05.006
So, it's no trouble. I can do
it every morning if you like.

49:06.691 --> 49:07.359
Oh, um...

49:09.415 --> 49:10.004
What's this?

49:10.613 --> 49:11.830
Oh. it's her phone number.

49:12.014 --> 49:13.761
She said to call if
I was any trouble.

49:13.977 --> 49:14.995
I don't have a telephone.

49:15.936 --> 49:18.415
I'm no trouble. You
could write her.

49:20.293 --> 49:22.826
Scratch my back, I'll
scratch the horse's. Huh.

49:27.833 --> 49:30.102
Here, you're going
the wrong way.

49:31.556 --> 49:32.340
Go downward,

49:33.574 --> 49:34.503
long strokes.

49:36.067 --> 49:36.604
Like this?

49:39.682 --> 49:43.023
'Believe me, you are
marvellously changed.'

49:43.492 --> 49:45.924
'I hold the world
but as the world,

49:47.155 --> 49:49.782
Grat... iano, a stage.'

49:50.034 --> 49:51.892
It's not a cereal
box you're reading.

49:52.138 --> 49:53.485
Why can't I read it silently?

49:53.717 --> 49:55.280
Because it's a play, Norstadt.

49:55.395 --> 49:56.489
You perform it.

49:57.545 --> 49:59.978
'I hold the world but as
the world, Gratiano.'

50:01.024 --> 50:01.955
'A stage,

50:02.193 --> 50:03.571
where every man
must play a part, '

50:05.527 --> 50:06.606
'and mine a sad one.'

50:07.851 --> 50:09.122
And what's his reason?

50:10.214 --> 50:11.812
'I am a Jew.'

50:14.452 --> 50:16.538
'Hath not a Jew eyes?'

50:18.529 --> 50:20.407
'Hath not a Jew hands, '

50:22.174 --> 50:22.817
'organs,

50:24.133 --> 50:25.040
dimensions, '

50:26.140 --> 50:29.153
'senses, affections, passions?'

50:31.031 --> 50:32.440
'Fed with the same food?

50:34.493 --> 50:35.939
Hurt with the same weapons?'

50:37.239 --> 50:39.203
'Subject to the same diseases,

50:39.430 --> 50:41.015
healed by the same means?'

50:41.183 --> 50:43.472
'Warmed and cooled
by the same winter

50:43.546 --> 50:45.233
and summer as a Christian is?'

50:46.279 --> 50:48.253
'If you prick us,
do we not bleed?

50:49.948 --> 50:51.492
'If you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

50:53.819 --> 50:56.716
'If you poison us,
do we not die?'

50:57.429 --> 50:59.351
'And if you wrong us...'

51:01.984 --> 51:03.763
'..shall we not revenge?'

51:06.361 --> 51:07.765
'By my soul, I swear

51:07.988 --> 51:10.267
there is no power in the
tongue of man to alter me.

51:11.043 --> 51:12.352
I stay upon my bond.'

51:13.889 --> 51:16.908
'Most heartily I do beseech the
court to give their judgement.'

51:18.643 --> 51:20.052
'Why, then, thus it is.

51:20.332 --> 51:22.730
You must prepare your
bosom for his knife.'

51:23.266 --> 51:24.243
'No!'

51:25.944 --> 51:26.953
'Yes!'

51:27.429 --> 51:31.735
'Aye, his breast. So says the
bond, doth it not, noble judge?'

51:32.412 --> 51:35.582
'Nearest his heart'... those
are the very words.'

51:39.440 --> 51:40.121
Is it my line?

51:40.188 --> 51:42.054
No, it's mine, but it's late.

51:42.130 --> 51:43.267
So, we'll finish this tomorrow.

51:44.036 --> 51:46.110
No, no. We started.
Now, let's finish.

51:46.394 --> 51:47.018
Tomorrow...

51:48.872 --> 51:49.799
and tomorrow...

51:50.969 --> 51:53.948
and tomorrow, creeps Charles E.

51:59.728 --> 52:00.686
Hello?

52:00.868 --> 52:01.966
Supper's in the oven.

52:03.452 --> 52:04.750
I'm not hungry.

52:07.189 --> 52:08.160
Do you know Shakespeare?

52:08.401 --> 52:11.401
Know him? I was his
Ophelia at Radcliffe.

52:12.106 --> 52:13.814
All right. How does The
Merchant of Venice end?

52:14.936 --> 52:15.977
I don't know. Why?

52:16.181 --> 52:18.199
Well, does the guy get his
heart cut out in that?

52:18.446 --> 52:21.446
Well, probably. Somebody dies.

52:21.983 --> 52:23.845
Somebody always dies at
the end of Shakespeare.

52:24.740 --> 52:26.646
You don't know. I thought
you said you knew it.

52:27.124 --> 52:30.185
Charles! I studied
those plays years ago.

52:30.585 --> 52:31.860
Why's it so important?

52:32.387 --> 52:33.059
It's not!

52:37.969 --> 52:39.261
Is he doing drugs?

52:45.889 --> 52:48.523
Hey, Norstadt! Forget the horse!

52:50.012 --> 52:52.157
Come on. Let's see if the
guy gets his heart cut out!

52:56.200 --> 52:57.430
'Do you confess the bond?'

52:57.564 --> 52:58.168
'I do.'

52:59.230 --> 53:00.899
'Then must the Jew be merciful.'

53:01.515 --> 53:03.558
'On what compulsion must I?
Tell me that.'

53:04.740 --> 53:06.955
'The quality of mercy
is not strained.

53:08.737 --> 53:10.602
'It droppeth as the gentle rain

53:10.663 --> 53:12.496
from heaven upon
the place beneath.

53:12.992 --> 53:14.232
'It is twice blessed.

53:15.433 --> 53:18.550
It blesseth him that
gives, and him that takes.

53:19.994 --> 53:22.614
'It is enthroned in
the hearts of kings.

53:24.523 --> 53:26.726
'It is an attribute
to God himself, '

53:28.300 --> 53:29.309
'and earthly power

53:29.991 --> 53:32.426
doth then show likest God's'

53:33.409 --> 53:35.479
'when mercy seasons justice.'

53:49.948 --> 53:50.955
What did she say she wanted?

53:51.084 --> 53:54.310
-Um, cookies... cookies and rice.
-Yeah.

53:54.417 --> 53:55.815
-They're over there.
-Oh, okay.

54:01.624 --> 54:03.880
Which one... Which type?

54:04.621 --> 54:06.486
How many types are there?

54:13.567 --> 54:15.948
-It's okay. So they'll make me fat.
-You're not fat.

54:16.469 --> 54:18.354
'Cause I want to get into
a dress on Saturday.

54:18.415 --> 54:19.633
-Why?
-Going out on a date.

54:20.126 --> 54:21.863
-Oh dear.
-Did you be on a motorcycle?

54:23.339 --> 54:27.162
Oh. I have to get some suntan lotion.
Hi, Chuck.

54:27.376 --> 54:27.987
I'm sorry.

54:28.621 --> 54:30.284
Sorry? For what?

54:31.125 --> 54:32.194
Oh, nothing.

54:41.170 --> 54:41.766
Sir?

54:42.305 --> 54:42.853
Yeah?

54:46.719 --> 54:48.271
Did you ever wonder...

54:49.805 --> 54:52.439
why men and women are
attracted to each other?

54:55.670 --> 54:57.454
It's called sex, Norstadt,

54:58.854 --> 55:00.104
and it's not on your exam.

55:02.286 --> 55:03.845
No. I don't mean like that.

55:05.550 --> 55:07.640
I mean, I mean, why
is it so difficult?

55:09.100 --> 55:11.832
You know, why can't they stay
together, stay attracted?

55:15.214 --> 55:15.818
You know,

55:17.084 --> 55:18.560
I never did consider myself

55:18.621 --> 55:20.439
a source of advice
for the lovelorn.

55:21.902 --> 55:22.953
Why, weren't you married?

55:24.206 --> 55:25.476
Yes, I was.

55:27.058 --> 55:28.120
A long time ago.

55:29.490 --> 55:31.923
Still, that hardly qualifies
me for any kind of

55:32.004 --> 55:34.095
reasonable answer to that question.
I'm...

55:42.785 --> 55:43.192
All right.

55:43.826 --> 55:45.662
Do you want the short
answer or the long one?

55:49.739 --> 55:50.586
Short, I guess.

55:51.289 --> 55:51.726
Good.

55:53.209 --> 55:55.336
The problem is one of water.

55:56.279 --> 55:56.817
Water?

55:57.095 --> 55:57.636
Water.

55:58.916 --> 56:02.782
Women have on average about
5% more of it than the men,

56:03.666 --> 56:05.909
making them subject to
different forces of gravity.

56:07.206 --> 56:09.470
Oh. Don't take my word for it,
you can look it up in Newton.

56:09.781 --> 56:10.384
It's there.

56:11.740 --> 56:12.921
Can they be drained?

56:15.921 --> 56:17.208
I'm serious!

56:19.659 --> 56:22.973
Well, I believe they're waiting
for us to drink more fluids.

56:35.279 --> 56:35.896
What now?

56:40.155 --> 56:41.314
I was wondering if...

56:43.612 --> 56:44.490
you really...

56:45.382 --> 56:47.250
write pornography?

57:02.776 --> 57:05.205
Is that the latest rumour?

57:05.720 --> 57:08.278
Come here. I'll show you
what I do for a living.

57:14.240 --> 57:14.665
Here.

57:19.648 --> 57:21.196
Tutoring doesn't pay
what it used to.

57:36.174 --> 57:37.619
Here's a few you
might have seen.

57:43.808 --> 57:45.256
-You did these?
-Yeah.

57:47.427 --> 57:49.087
Wow. Yeah, I've seen this one.

57:49.856 --> 57:50.857
Well, what do you know?

58:02.990 --> 58:06.085
Well, we don't get a
lot of live specimens

58:06.146 --> 58:08.485
at the castle, do we, Norstadt?

58:18.007 --> 58:20.102
Come on, Norstadt,
back to Caesar's Gaul.

58:21.467 --> 58:22.615
How did it happen?

58:24.606 --> 58:25.504
Was it in the war?

58:29.268 --> 58:31.327
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have asked.

58:31.552 --> 58:32.822
Oh, that's all right, uh...

58:33.772 --> 58:35.308
Everyone does, sooner or later.

58:38.074 --> 58:39.207
It was in a car crash.

58:39.956 --> 58:40.712
I'm sorry.

58:41.684 --> 58:42.739
So am I.

58:43.298 --> 58:44.619
Not just for this, but...

58:46.547 --> 58:48.200
There was a boy killed
in that car crash

58:48.261 --> 58:49.253
and he burned to death.

58:54.345 --> 58:55.025
Time.

58:57.748 --> 58:59.392
Let's pick up the
slack tomorrow, huh?

59:00.102 --> 59:00.884
8.30, sharp.

59:09.834 --> 59:11.541
Yes! Double sixes!

59:11.711 --> 59:13.620
Big Julie is dead!

59:13.857 --> 59:16.145
Yes, he gets the hook,

59:16.206 --> 59:18.805
new King of the Mountain.

59:19.033 --> 59:21.125
I won! I won!

59:21.186 --> 59:22.863
Now, just remember Norstadt,

59:22.924 --> 59:24.997
that on the exam
Caesar wins, okay?

59:27.032 --> 59:27.938
Wiseacre.

59:29.676 --> 59:31.625
Well, you want to be Romans
or Gauls this time?

59:33.347 --> 59:33.943
Sir?

59:37.633 --> 59:39.351
It was a lousy thing to happen.

59:41.494 --> 59:44.446
-What?
-Lots of people die in accidents.

59:46.162 --> 59:47.317
It wasn't your fault.

59:48.759 --> 59:49.518
Norstadt...

59:50.419 --> 59:51.337
No, look.

59:53.839 --> 59:55.923
Even if it was, it
doesn't matter.

59:55.984 --> 59:57.454
Look. It doesn't matter to me.

59:57.699 --> 59:58.621
Norstadt!

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:17.441
Hey, look who it is!

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.967
Who is it, bat boy?

01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:22.987
Hey, Norstadt!

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:28.032
Hi, Chuck.

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.863
Come on, you're hoggin' it.
Over here.

01:00:38.804 --> 01:00:40.326
How's the scholar doin'?

01:00:41.318 --> 01:00:42.539
How's your freaky friend?

01:00:44.226 --> 01:00:45.154
He's all right...

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:47.271
for a Hamburger-Head.

01:00:49.975 --> 01:00:51.222
So, how d'you know, anyway?

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.690
I gave your sister a pink belly
till she squealed like a pig!

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:55.435
Jerks.

01:00:55.496 --> 01:00:56.468
Oh, you guys!

01:00:56.575 --> 01:00:58.973
Just don't tell anyone,
all right guys?

01:00:59.034 --> 01:00:59.761
Why not?

01:00:59.912 --> 01:01:00.776
Just don't.

01:01:01.303 --> 01:01:02.947
Not till I take the exam okay.

01:01:03.024 --> 01:01:05.122
You're gonna hate that
army school, you know.

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.473
I don't care.

01:01:07.094 --> 01:01:08.079
I just want out.

01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:09.558
Do you know how
he hurt his face?

01:01:09.778 --> 01:01:11.628
Yeah, how'd the
Hamburger get burnt?

01:01:12.547 --> 01:01:13.141
Please!

01:01:13.814 --> 01:01:14.681
Car crash.

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:18.676
He got burnt and a
kid got killed.

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:21.866
The Freak killed a kid? No shit!

01:01:22.982 --> 01:01:25.080
Listen, guys, don't
go say anything about

01:01:25.976 --> 01:01:27.323
McLeod. All right?

01:01:27.427 --> 01:01:28.374
Who would we tell?

01:01:29.048 --> 01:01:31.608
My friends hate me and I
don't know anybody else.

01:01:35.142 --> 01:01:36.350
What? It's true.

01:01:48.544 --> 01:01:49.694
Hello, Charles.

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.616
Would you come
down here, please?

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:00.595
What's the matter,
can't you hear me?

01:02:01.237 --> 01:02:02.739
I said come down here!

01:02:04.052 --> 01:02:06.829
Who you been talkin' to,
you little bastard?

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.273
Huh?

01:02:09.246 --> 01:02:10.448
Who did you tell?

01:02:13.136 --> 01:02:14.754
Come down here, I said!

01:02:15.087 --> 01:02:17.719
Or are you deaf as
well as stupid?

01:02:18.751 --> 01:02:20.774
Who's there? Who's that?

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:24.080
Get down here! Or do I have
to come up and get you?

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.557
It's three o'clock in the morning!
I'll call the police.

01:02:26.628 --> 01:02:29.172
Who you been talkin' to,
you little bastard?

01:02:29.342 --> 01:02:31.581
Do you realise what
you've done to me?

01:03:13.571 --> 01:03:14.647
Help yourself!

01:03:16.162 --> 01:03:17.109
Morning, Chuck.

01:03:17.577 --> 01:03:18.684
What's happening, man?

01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:23.237
-Charles...
-We have some big news.

01:03:23.556 --> 01:03:24.794
Go ahead, tell him.

01:03:26.493 --> 01:03:28.050
Your mom and I are
going to be married.

01:03:31.101 --> 01:03:33.964
Charles... Is there
something you want to say?

01:03:34.025 --> 01:03:34.809
you are too small.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.918
You may be tall but
you're stupid.

01:03:36.998 --> 01:03:39.081
Gloria! You're practically naked!
Go get some clothes on.

01:03:39.142 --> 01:03:40.588
So what? It's my house!

01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:41.867
Heard the news?

01:03:41.927 --> 01:03:43.197
I heard it yesterday.

01:03:43.258 --> 01:03:45.854
Don't freak with delight
It might go to my head.

01:03:45.915 --> 01:03:48.363
-Welcome to the family, Carl.
-Thank you, Meg.

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.580
Watch out, she bites.

01:03:49.641 --> 01:03:51.219
-You bite!
-Butt out!

01:03:51.279 --> 01:03:54.017
-Shut up, Gloria!
-Everyone, be quiet, and...

01:03:54.077 --> 01:03:55.261
Think happy thoughts.

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:57.328
Are we going to live
with you in Connecticut, Carl?

01:03:57.474 --> 01:03:59.268
Yes. Sure. As a matter of fact,

01:03:59.424 --> 01:04:02.048
this weekend, your mom and I are
going looking for a new home,

01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:03.369
and you're coming with us.

01:04:03.877 --> 01:04:05.520
What about you? You want
to come along too, man?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.052
What about me? I don't get
a say in where we live?

01:04:08.113 --> 01:04:09.663
Of course you do,
come along, then.

01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:12.715
Well, I can't, because I'm going to
Dad's, remember? I told you, Mother!

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:13.868
Oh, well! How convenient.

01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:15.938
Well, I can't go, because
I've got to study

01:04:15.999 --> 01:04:18.065
for an exam and take
care of my cats!

01:04:18.126 --> 01:04:18.796
Oh, Charles!

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:19.602
I don't take milk.

01:04:19.802 --> 01:04:21.835
Oh, you don't take milk...
No, no, no, no...

01:04:21.896 --> 01:04:24.905
Your cat brother has developed
a fetish for my underwear!

01:04:24.966 --> 01:04:26.452
No accounting for taste!

01:04:26.526 --> 01:04:27.752
The thing is just tampering...

01:04:27.813 --> 01:04:28.886
I think we should
put it to sleep.

01:04:28.947 --> 01:04:30.453
I think we should
put you to sleep.

01:04:30.514 --> 01:04:32.040
You touch Mac and you're dead!

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.079
-What are you...
-I'm trying to eat!

01:04:38.639 --> 01:04:40.220
Don't hit your sister!

01:04:40.281 --> 01:04:42.403
Don't you think we should avoid
him, because of his background?

01:04:42.464 --> 01:04:43.503
That's enough, Gloria!

01:04:43.564 --> 01:04:44.783
-Done!
-Jees!

01:04:44.868 --> 01:04:46.118
Well, he started it!

01:04:46.179 --> 01:04:47.229
That's enough!

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.153
It's okay, it's okay.

01:05:04.062 --> 01:05:04.692
Morning.

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:06.827
Sorry to be late.

01:05:08.773 --> 01:05:10.204
That's all right. Uh...

01:05:11.536 --> 01:05:12.426
I wanted to talk to you,

01:05:13.573 --> 01:05:14.973
about what happened yesterday.

01:05:16.427 --> 01:05:19.618
Seems I'm not so good
with people any more.

01:05:21.302 --> 01:05:23.436
I've forgotten how to
be with them, I guess.

01:05:24.226 --> 01:05:25.294
Can you understand that?

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:27.759
Doesn't matter.

01:05:28.903 --> 01:05:29.476
Doesn't it?

01:05:30.454 --> 01:05:31.232
No. Why should it?

01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:37.564
So, can we start?

01:05:38.967 --> 01:05:39.564
All right.

01:05:44.068 --> 01:05:45.036
Your turn, Dougie.

01:05:47.812 --> 01:05:51.368
B-E-D. Bed.

01:05:51.429 --> 01:05:53.422
Six. Very good, Doug. Excellent.

01:05:54.937 --> 01:05:59.980
Triple word score, double
letter on the F. 48 points.

01:06:01.048 --> 01:06:04.864
Have you heard the
latest on the F-R-E-A-K?

01:06:05.096 --> 01:06:06.739
Gloria, don't call him that.

01:06:06.883 --> 01:06:09.679
I mean, sorry. The
reclusive deformed warpo.

01:06:09.802 --> 01:06:10.442
What?

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.235
I heard he killed a kid when
he got that face.

01:06:14.222 --> 01:06:15.667
So Rob's mother said.

01:06:16.408 --> 01:06:18.344
Of course, she
thinks he's JFK...

01:06:18.411 --> 01:06:20.180
Mom, I think you
should know that...

01:06:20.885 --> 01:06:23.062
Erm, who's winning?

01:06:23.475 --> 01:06:26.036
Um... I think I am.

01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:34.893
Charles, I can't send you

01:06:34.954 --> 01:06:37.171
to the Lansings' with
a carton of beans.

01:06:38.085 --> 01:06:40.308
Now look here. What about this?
You like this, don't you?

01:06:40.922 --> 01:06:42.648
No, I like beans.

01:06:44.026 --> 01:06:45.538
Sorry, Mrs. Camlin.

01:06:46.281 --> 01:06:47.261
Take your time.

01:06:47.468 --> 01:06:50.500
We always stay a bit late on
Thursdays for Mr. McLeod.

01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:51.923
Oh, that's nice of you.

01:06:56.647 --> 01:06:57.410
Ah!

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:00.693
What?

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:01.997
Um...

01:07:02.912 --> 01:07:04.207
Um... I have to go
to the bathroom.

01:07:05.099 --> 01:07:06.667
Wait until we get home.

01:07:07.472 --> 01:07:10.288
Mom, I have to pee so bad
I'm gonna wiz out my ear!

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.287
Downstairs to the left.

01:07:14.758 --> 01:07:15.245
What...

01:07:27.165 --> 01:07:27.766
Good evening.

01:07:28.562 --> 01:07:30.418
It's almost ready, Mr. McLeod.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:31.992
Thank you.

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:39.303
Er...

01:07:41.172 --> 01:07:43.795
There you are. That does it.
Thank you.

01:07:44.025 --> 01:07:44.614
Thank you.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:57.629
-Bye, honey.
-Bye, Carl.

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:58.389
Thank you.

01:07:58.951 --> 01:08:00.475
Call us when you get there!

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:03.183
Bye-bye!

01:08:03.973 --> 01:08:04.680
Bye-bye.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:08.228
Want a beer?

01:08:08.578 --> 01:08:09.286
Yeah. Want a beer?

01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:13.747
Yeah.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:21.091
Now. Quidem magistri
discipulos tanta

01:08:21.153 --> 01:08:24.787
cumata dulcebant ut
ipsi discipulis.

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:27.094
Quidem discurae cuperen.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:27.760
Now...

01:08:27.821 --> 01:08:31.845
Okay. 'Some teachers used to
teach their pupils so well...'

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.933
With such great art.

01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:36.622
Erm... 'that...'

01:08:37.073 --> 01:08:38.990
This is Latin, not Swahili.

01:08:39.978 --> 01:08:41.840
You had this a week ago.
What's the matter with you?

01:08:45.973 --> 01:08:47.072
Good afternoon.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.046
Afternoon.

01:08:49.276 --> 01:08:50.015
Good hunting?

01:08:50.115 --> 01:08:51.435
Can't complain.

01:08:55.344 --> 01:09:00.719
All right. Quidem magistri
discipulos, tanta cumata...

01:09:01.719 --> 01:09:02.970
What are you lookin' at, huh?

01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:05.555
I said what are you lookin' at?

01:09:05.616 --> 01:09:06.825
Norstadt, come here!

01:09:07.282 --> 01:09:07.675
Come on.

01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:11.645
Ass holes!

01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:29.679
Better bring it up, Norstadt,

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:31.332
whatever it is.

01:09:37.662 --> 01:09:38.962
I told how you got hurt,

01:09:40.038 --> 01:09:41.484
and how the kid died.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.117
Now everybody knows.

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:45.911
And why did you do that?

01:09:46.497 --> 01:09:47.091
It was...

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.287
I got... I...

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:52.974
I was really angry.

01:09:55.313 --> 01:09:56.660
You're a hard
marker, aren't you?

01:09:58.457 --> 01:10:01.394
People are either in or they're out.
Strictly pass or fail.

01:10:01.601 --> 01:10:02.400
I'm sorry.

01:10:03.606 --> 01:10:05.258
I'm sorry. I betrayed you.

01:10:05.507 --> 01:10:06.970
I stabbed you in the back,

01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:08.915
and I don't even know why.

01:10:10.418 --> 01:10:13.195
Oh, come on, we're not
doin' Julius Caesar now.

01:10:13.886 --> 01:10:14.553
What?

01:10:15.815 --> 01:10:16.955
Et tu, Chuckus?

01:10:17.269 --> 01:10:18.478
It's all right, I'll live.

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:22.977
You mean you don't hate my guts?

01:10:24.707 --> 01:10:26.624
No, I don't hate your guts.

01:10:27.665 --> 01:10:28.471
Come on.

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:32.125
Do you think I'm crazy?

01:10:33.826 --> 01:10:36.292
You know. One of those
kids who offs himself

01:10:36.353 --> 01:10:38.700
and writes a letter
blaming Ed Sullivan.

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:40.192
Why?

01:10:40.514 --> 01:10:41.421
Oh, I don't know.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.790
The shrinks at school thought
I was pretty twisted.

01:10:44.843 --> 01:10:46.233
Probably because
you're interesting.

01:10:47.521 --> 01:10:49.196
Sometimes I blank out,

01:10:49.904 --> 01:10:50.871
and I feel bad...

01:10:51.365 --> 01:10:52.831
I think about the past

01:10:53.904 --> 01:10:55.568
my mother, my father.

01:10:55.629 --> 01:10:57.550
See, I don't really
know how he died.

01:10:59.192 --> 01:11:00.980
My parents split up
when I was four.

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:02.399
And all those stuff about

01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:05.257
spy planes and pilots.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:08.020
All of it, I made it all up to impress you.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.683
To make me tutor you.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.313
Yeah.

01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:15.408
You needn't worry, Norstadt,
you're not crazy.

01:11:16.635 --> 01:11:17.402
You're shrewd.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:23.466
People spend too much time
thinking of the past.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:26.926
Whatever else it is, it's gone.

01:11:27.853 --> 01:11:28.509
You know what?

01:11:29.302 --> 01:11:31.609
Everybody else would be all
over me with questions.

01:11:33.619 --> 01:11:36.092
'What do you mean you're crazy, Charles?
Is your brain hot?'

01:11:37.128 --> 01:11:38.464
You never do that.

01:11:39.472 --> 01:11:41.697
It's just habit. I like privacy.

01:11:42.025 --> 01:11:42.947
You know, well um...

01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:44.773
what about living alone?
Do you like that?

01:11:46.397 --> 01:11:47.149
It likes me.

01:11:48.624 --> 01:11:49.316
What do you mean?

01:11:50.215 --> 01:11:53.019
I've become a proper fairy-tale
troll here, Norstadt.

01:11:55.123 --> 01:11:56.267
Tourist Board ought to pay me.

01:11:56.801 --> 01:11:57.780
You're not a troll.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.215
I'm a troll.

01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:02.431
That's my job, Norstadt.

01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:03.387
My part.

01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:05.993
You want this?

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.135
No. No, you keep it.

01:12:10.703 --> 01:12:11.994
By the way, uh...

01:12:13.684 --> 01:12:15.768
I'm setting you a
practice exam tomorrow.

01:12:16.079 --> 01:12:17.424
But I haven't studied!

01:12:17.572 --> 01:12:18.471
'Then I'll make ya.'

01:12:25.643 --> 01:12:26.852
'You're soft.'

01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:34.217
'Won't anything
make a man of you?'

01:12:34.916 --> 01:12:36.090
'Kill him Billy.'

01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:37.461
'Whoever...'

01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:46.750
'All right. For 14 years I've been
scared but it's gonna be all right!'

01:13:16.719 --> 01:13:17.383
Time's up.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.988
Pens down, time's up. Come on, Norstadt.
Pens down.

01:13:22.442 --> 01:13:22.888
Come on!

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.357
Good.

01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:29.084
-Can you mark it now?
-No, tonight.

01:13:29.145 --> 01:13:30.589
-Come on.
-You're too excited.

01:13:31.762 --> 01:13:33.351
I know I didn't get
the third one right

01:13:33.412 --> 01:13:35.173
because we didn't do
reciprocal proportions.

01:13:35.234 --> 01:13:37.552
-Go home, Norstadt.
-No!

01:13:38.868 --> 01:13:39.461
Patience.

01:13:43.450 --> 01:13:43.974
Thank you.

01:13:56.525 --> 01:13:58.273
I'll try some of this tonight.

01:13:58.334 --> 01:13:58.808
Good.

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:08.950
Say, Chuck, were you
out hiking lately?

01:14:09.689 --> 01:14:11.697
Er, no, not me.

01:14:12.264 --> 01:14:14.662
Up north, Mr. McLeod's place?

01:14:15.379 --> 01:14:18.519
Uh... no, not me. I'm in
a real hurry here.

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:22.654
I don't know.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.053
Well?

01:14:41.946 --> 01:14:42.496
Well?

01:14:44.417 --> 01:14:45.285
Are you going to tell me?

01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:46.564
Get in.

01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:49.915
Are you gonna tell me! Or
do I have to kill you?

01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:51.867
84 per cent.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.025
84 per cent?

01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:57.407
No way, that is great!
84 per cent!

01:14:57.627 --> 01:15:01.347
Yes. I'm a genius!
I am a genius now!

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.830
I am one of the geniuses!

01:15:02.911 --> 01:15:05.050
All right, Norstadt. It
is only a practice exam.

01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:06.370
Don't get cocky. Get in.

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.523
You know what? I'm brilliant!
I am a regular Einstein!

01:15:10.584 --> 01:15:11.755
Norstadt!

01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:14.462
Okay, how come we're not
studying if I'm so stupid?

01:15:14.523 --> 01:15:15.996
Because it's carrot day.

01:15:18.743 --> 01:15:19.694
Put your belt on.

01:15:32.218 --> 01:15:33.590
Wow, look at the seaplane!

01:15:33.856 --> 01:15:35.255
It's not a seaplane,
it's a carrot.

01:15:36.998 --> 01:15:37.819
You're kidding?

01:15:38.904 --> 01:15:41.767
What are you waiting for?
Take off. Go on.

01:16:15.786 --> 01:16:17.674
Now you can tell
him you've flown.

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:38.775
Think you can handle
this yourself? Huh?

01:16:38.867 --> 01:16:39.475
Really?

01:17:01.819 --> 01:17:03.624
-Did you see us dive up there?
-Yes.

01:17:03.725 --> 01:17:06.522
Yeah. How fast do you think
we're going, huh? 100? 125?

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:07.585
'I don't know. Probably about...

01:17:07.646 --> 01:17:10.392
No. 165 miles an hour.

01:17:10.546 --> 01:17:11.740
You know, John says
we were getting

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:13.140
some really good wind up there.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:15.858
John says it's
not like a passenger plane.

01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:18.571
Hey, you know what? John
flew a Starfighter once.

01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:19.867
As a matter of fact, I did.

01:17:19.928 --> 01:17:20.984
Yeah. He flew a Starfighter.

01:17:21.176 --> 01:17:22.100
Unbelievable.

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.938
I mean, can you imagine the
G-force on something like that?

01:17:25.001 --> 01:17:26.348
And this was bad enough.

01:17:26.546 --> 01:17:27.349
And the instruments...

01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:29.828
Oh, you should have seen
the dials on this, man.

01:17:29.921 --> 01:17:33.918
But, on the jet, it had to be
ten times as many, at least.

01:17:39.974 --> 01:17:42.481
What, you thought it was
Brigitte Bardot driving?

01:17:43.685 --> 01:17:44.448
No.

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:48.267
No, I was just
thinking, it's weird.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.328
What?

01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:51.161
Now I can't see your
scars any more.

01:17:52.171 --> 01:17:53.920
I can hardly even
tell they're there.

01:17:55.986 --> 01:17:56.919
What about you?

01:17:57.544 --> 01:17:58.775
It's different for me.

01:17:59.438 --> 01:18:00.171
Yeah.

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:03.872
Did you ever try
to have it fixed?

01:18:04.886 --> 01:18:06.946
No. I thought about it,

01:18:08.262 --> 01:18:09.565
but it just never seemed right.

01:18:11.664 --> 01:18:13.571
My sister wanted to know

01:18:13.632 --> 01:18:15.466
if maybe you'd be
interested in our mother.

01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:17.709
She could keep me in the attic.

01:18:18.821 --> 01:18:19.334
Can she cook?

01:18:19.489 --> 01:18:22.061
Hello, no, but she's gorgeous.

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.484
You could save us from
the hairball too.

01:18:24.809 --> 01:18:26.287
-He's number five?
-Yeah.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.930
-He can't be that bad.
-What?

01:18:39.909 --> 01:18:41.406
You know, I can wait
for you if you like

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.929
and then drop you off
at the Lansings'.

01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:44.610
No. It's okay. I've got to

01:18:45.581 --> 01:18:48.038
feed the cat and then
I'm gonna get off.

01:18:48.216 --> 01:18:49.117
-All right.
-Okay.

01:18:52.231 --> 01:18:53.005
Thanks a lot.

01:18:54.002 --> 01:18:55.770
Hey, Mac, you hungry?

01:18:56.828 --> 01:18:58.005
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:02.774
No, get down. Come on, come on.

01:19:07.237 --> 01:19:08.457
I guess you were hungry.

01:19:09.338 --> 01:19:10.052
Yes.

01:19:40.384 --> 01:19:41.292
What are you doin'?

01:19:41.353 --> 01:19:42.027
Get out!

01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:43.322
You heard her. Get out of here!

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:45.087
-Charles. What are you doing?
-What a day!

01:19:45.148 --> 01:19:46.200
Charles. What are you...

01:19:47.026 --> 01:19:48.890
What a perfect day!

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.440
You're mommy's chosen one.

01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:51.117
Come here!

01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:52.246
Doug, do something!

01:19:52.307 --> 01:19:53.327
-Come here!
-Uh-uh.

01:19:53.905 --> 01:19:56.402
Come here! Godamn it. Come here.

01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:57.982
You going to keep quiet?

01:19:58.362 --> 01:19:59.917
Flintstone, you could kill me,

01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:02.440
and I'd die happy
telling Mother.

01:20:04.906 --> 01:20:06.569
You keep your mouth
shut, you hear?

01:20:07.324 --> 01:20:09.231
-You hear me?
-Forget it!

01:20:17.891 --> 01:20:18.529
Bastard!

01:20:21.434 --> 01:20:22.853
Let me go! He's hurt!

01:20:22.914 --> 01:20:24.648
Hey, calm down,
kid, you're crazy!

01:20:24.813 --> 01:20:27.431
Of course, he's crazy. His
father was a psychotic maniac!

01:20:27.492 --> 01:20:28.831
Shut up, you stupid cow!

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:30.650
-Gloria?
-No. He should know.

01:20:31.388 --> 01:20:32.972
Your father was an abusive drunk

01:20:33.397 --> 01:20:35.349
who killed himself in
a mental hospital.

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:37.382
And you will too, if
you don't smarten up.

01:20:37.449 --> 01:20:39.703
Liar! I'm gonna smash
your lyin' face!

01:20:39.764 --> 01:20:40.720
You don't believe me?

01:20:40.999 --> 01:20:42.562
Bottom drawer of
Mother's dresser.

01:20:42.731 --> 01:20:44.556
Liar! You're dead!

01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:46.601
All right. You're going to be good?
Huh.

01:20:46.662 --> 01:20:47.949
I'll let you up if you're good.

01:20:49.398 --> 01:20:51.954
Don't listen to her, man, she's
just tryin' to get you goin'.

01:21:35.985 --> 01:21:38.063
Charles? What's the matter?

01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:40.665
Charles? What's wrong?

01:21:45.263 --> 01:21:45.842
Charles?

01:21:56.547 --> 01:21:59.540
They were in bed... and...

01:22:00.494 --> 01:22:03.605
he hurt Mac... and...
she said...

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:05.507
Take it easy. Go slow.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.351
She said...

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:07.313
She...

01:22:08.577 --> 01:22:10.140
You know I don't
have a father...

01:22:11.133 --> 01:22:14.301
cos he walked out on
me to be a drunk.

01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:17.772
To be a crazy fucking drunk!

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.569
He killed himself in a
mental institution.

01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:27.616
Here, sit down.

01:22:47.675 --> 01:22:49.001
Morning, Mr. McLeod.

01:22:49.677 --> 01:22:50.711
Good morning, Chief...?

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:52.411
-Stark.
-Chief Stark.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.468
-Can I come in?
-Oh, please. Come in. Come in.

01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:58.388
I'm trying to locate the Norstadt boy.
Is he here?

01:22:58.449 --> 01:22:59.601
He is here, yes.

01:23:00.134 --> 01:23:02.348
He is? Oh, that's a relief.

01:23:02.864 --> 01:23:04.814
The Lansings are
in quite a state.

01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:09.253
They had some kind of family
melodrama there last night.

01:23:09.438 --> 01:23:11.854
Oh yes. He was very upset
when he arrived here.

01:23:12.045 --> 01:23:14.693
I'm sorry I don't have a telephone
or I would have called.

01:23:15.692 --> 01:23:19.392
-I hear Morris says you're tutoring Chuck.
-Yes, that's correct.

01:23:20.158 --> 01:23:21.112
That's fine.

01:23:22.107 --> 01:23:23.930
-Can I see him?
-He's asleep. I'll...

01:23:23.991 --> 01:23:25.210
-Where would that be?
-Upstairs.

01:23:25.515 --> 01:23:26.193
I'll go and...

01:23:26.254 --> 01:23:29.530
It's all right. I'll just go and take
a peek, see if he's all right...

01:23:30.387 --> 01:23:31.216
What's goin' on?

01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:35.416
It's time for you
to go home, son.

01:23:36.069 --> 01:23:37.847
It's all right. There's
nothing to worry about.

01:23:39.065 --> 01:23:41.056
You've given a lot
of people a fright.

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.308
-I don't wanna go. I'm staying here.
-Charles.

01:23:45.614 --> 01:23:48.344
Your mother's worried about you.
She's on her way back.

01:23:48.611 --> 01:23:50.683
I don't care. I'm
staying right here!

01:23:51.162 --> 01:23:54.485
-Why don't you get your clothes and let's go.
-No!

01:23:54.546 --> 01:23:55.682
Charles... Charles...

01:23:57.431 --> 01:23:58.570
I want you to get dressed

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.536
and go with Chief Stark.

01:24:00.597 --> 01:24:01.423
What?

01:24:02.385 --> 01:24:03.084
You have to.

01:24:04.186 --> 01:24:05.447
It'll be all right. Go on.

01:24:07.089 --> 01:24:07.729
Go on.

01:24:16.088 --> 01:24:17.894
Why d'you lie to me
the other day, son?

01:24:19.501 --> 01:24:20.215
I don't know.

01:24:22.889 --> 01:24:24.763
You like your
teacher, don't you?

01:24:26.106 --> 01:24:27.285
He's my best friend.

01:24:52.446 --> 01:24:53.249
Charles...

01:24:55.282 --> 01:24:56.200
I'm sorry.

01:24:57.818 --> 01:24:58.680
I'm sorry.

01:25:03.752 --> 01:25:05.283
Is that why you divorced him?

01:25:06.471 --> 01:25:07.592
Cos he was psycho?

01:25:09.947 --> 01:25:11.334
That was wicked of Gloria.

01:25:12.185 --> 01:25:13.819
Charles, it was just wicked.

01:25:17.847 --> 01:25:18.753
Your father wasn't...

01:25:19.857 --> 01:25:22.135
Your father was a wonderful man.

01:25:23.435 --> 01:25:25.793
But he had problems,
and when he drank...

01:25:27.632 --> 01:25:28.753
we just couldn't handle it.

01:25:30.496 --> 01:25:31.527
He hurt us, didn't he?

01:25:32.934 --> 01:25:34.191
Oh, my poor boy.

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:37.360
My poor Chuck.

01:25:38.863 --> 01:25:41.740
Oh, what a time you've had.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:46.309
Y'know, I always blamed you.

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:48.440
I know, baby, I know.

01:25:50.287 --> 01:25:50.952
It's all right.

01:25:56.342 --> 01:25:56.788
Charles,

01:25:58.573 --> 01:26:01.509
why didn't you tell me you
were going to see Mr. McLeod?

01:26:01.943 --> 01:26:03.274
Well, I wanted to, but

01:26:04.254 --> 01:26:05.969
I didn't think you'd let me go.

01:26:07.253 --> 01:26:08.338
You're mad, aren't you?

01:26:10.187 --> 01:26:11.323
No, Charles.

01:26:12.175 --> 01:26:13.423
See, he's my tutor,

01:26:14.732 --> 01:26:16.114
but he's also my friend.

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:19.682
I can tell him anything.

01:26:23.002 --> 01:26:24.367
Last night, did he...

01:26:25.574 --> 01:26:27.540
or at any other time...
did he...

01:26:28.686 --> 01:26:29.293
touch you?

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:31.500
Yeah, sure.

01:26:33.289 --> 01:26:34.286
How did he touch you?

01:26:35.088 --> 01:26:36.717
Why are you asking me this?

01:26:37.993 --> 01:26:39.624
I told you he's my friend.

01:26:41.968 --> 01:26:42.851
Just tell me.

01:26:45.106 --> 01:26:47.529
Chief Stark told me something
about your friend.

01:26:49.717 --> 01:26:51.822
A boy was killed in
a driving accident.

01:26:52.067 --> 01:26:54.063
Yeah. yeah. I know, he told me.
So what?

01:26:55.391 --> 01:26:57.387
He went to prison
for three years.

01:26:59.419 --> 01:27:02.241
The boy that was killed
was a pupil of his.

01:27:03.576 --> 01:27:06.328
He was in the car with McLeod
and they were having...

01:27:10.118 --> 01:27:11.772
He was abusing the boy, Charles.

01:27:11.972 --> 01:27:13.602
Do you understand
what that means?

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:18.113
No.

01:27:19.755 --> 01:27:20.229
No.

01:27:20.999 --> 01:27:23.196
You don't want me to
love anyone else,

01:27:24.141 --> 01:27:26.705
so you hate him. You hate him.

01:27:26.766 --> 01:27:27.703
Charles!

01:27:28.455 --> 01:27:30.212
Charles, please! Listen to me!

01:27:30.273 --> 01:27:32.270
I'm only trying to protect you!

01:27:32.867 --> 01:27:35.509
You're a liar! Leave me alone!

01:27:45.933 --> 01:27:47.499
Get out of my sight!

01:27:48.632 --> 01:27:49.263
I'm sorry.

01:28:08.048 --> 01:28:10.586
Hello, Mrs. Palin. My name is...

01:28:10.959 --> 01:28:13.053
I know who you are.
What do you want here?

01:28:13.324 --> 01:28:14.504
Uh... I...

01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:17.478
I came to see Charles and
I wanted to explain...

01:28:17.539 --> 01:28:18.901
What you've been
doing to my son?

01:28:19.439 --> 01:28:20.979
I haven't done
anything to your son.

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:24.331
What? You expect me to believe that?
Coming from you?

01:28:24.873 --> 01:28:27.072
How do they let people
like you walk around?

01:28:27.249 --> 01:28:29.057
You're being irrational.
Let me...

01:28:29.202 --> 01:28:31.760
What? You want to see irrational?
Mess with my kids.

01:28:31.821 --> 01:28:34.505
I'll show you irrational!
Get out!

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:36.144
Get out!

01:29:12.284 --> 01:29:13.147
Ah, Doctor.

01:29:14.944 --> 01:29:17.258
Mrs. Palin, this is Dr Talbot.

01:29:18.505 --> 01:29:20.499
He's come all the way
from Bangor to see us.

01:29:21.052 --> 01:29:22.055
Hello, Charles.

01:29:22.702 --> 01:29:23.777
Just call me Lionel.

01:29:28.586 --> 01:29:29.472
John Wayne.

01:29:30.822 --> 01:29:32.096
And how do you feel about that?

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.535
What do you mean?

01:29:34.421 --> 01:29:36.475
Do you feel good about
seeing John Wayne,

01:29:36.536 --> 01:29:39.972
or does it make you uneasy?

01:29:40.489 --> 01:29:43.088
I don't know what I feel. Why
do I have to feel anything?

01:29:43.653 --> 01:29:44.414
No. You don't.

01:29:45.576 --> 01:29:48.792
But you don't want to keep things
hidden that could hurt you.

01:29:51.865 --> 01:29:53.956
There's no right or
wrong answer here...

01:29:54.257 --> 01:29:56.081
Okay, Chuck?

01:29:57.986 --> 01:29:59.558
Lets'... let's try another.

01:30:06.846 --> 01:30:09.062
-It's a very sensitive issue, Mr.
McLeod.

01:30:09.368 --> 01:30:10.608
The mother's concerned.

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.809
-Have you talked to
Charles or haven't you?

01:30:13.181 --> 01:30:13.998
Yes, we have.

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:15.862
Then what do you
need a meeting for?

01:30:16.638 --> 01:30:18.389
What did he say? What
di you say to him?

01:30:18.516 --> 01:30:22.002
I can't discuss that. We
just want a little meeting.

01:30:23.207 --> 01:30:24.140
You mean a trial.

01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:28.342
No. No. It's just an
informal get-together.

01:30:28.403 --> 01:30:30.325
We just wanna get
the facts straight.

01:30:31.066 --> 01:30:32.457
You don't even need a lawyer.

01:30:33.944 --> 01:30:37.038
Mr. McLeod, I would
appreciate it though

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.015
if you didn't try to
see the boy right now.

01:30:39.362 --> 01:30:40.729
Not till after the meeting.

01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:43.098
I'd appreciate it.

01:30:46.583 --> 01:30:49.467
I came here to get away
from your meetings and...

01:30:53.955 --> 01:30:55.959
Seven years I've lived here...

01:30:56.415 --> 01:30:58.748
alone in this house,
and in peace.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.521
Maybe it would have
been best all around

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:04.046
if that's the way
things had stayed.

01:31:11.119 --> 01:31:12.557
You promised me!

01:31:12.849 --> 01:31:14.908
Charles, how can I possibly
let you take that exam

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.145
after everything
that's happened?

01:31:16.206 --> 01:31:18.269
Nothing's happened! Nothing!

01:31:18.672 --> 01:31:20.379
Why won't you believe me? Why?

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.255
It's out of my hands Charles.

01:31:22.316 --> 01:31:23.370
It's in the hands of
the authorities and

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:25.550
they'll decide if there's
anything to decide.

01:31:25.699 --> 01:31:29.885
Oh, my gosh, I cannot live here!
I can't live here!

01:31:30.174 --> 01:31:32.287
There's perfectly good
schools in Connecticut.

01:31:32.348 --> 01:31:33.919
I'll run! I will run!

01:31:34.557 --> 01:31:35.363
Don't be ridiculous.

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:37.190
Charles. Okay, Charles.

01:31:38.881 --> 01:31:40.277
Charles, I'll talk to Gloria.

01:31:40.606 --> 01:31:43.327
It's not Gloria I
can't live with.

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.018
I'm sorry.

01:31:51.523 --> 01:31:52.690
You do whatever you
want, all right?

01:32:23.243 --> 01:32:24.509
Mr. McLeod, I'm...

01:32:25.363 --> 01:32:28.351
I'm afraid we're getting too
old to stay open so late.

01:32:29.976 --> 01:32:32.099
You'll just have to come
back at our regular hours.

01:32:33.755 --> 01:32:34.907
Sorry for your trouble.

01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:50.436
Oh Charles,

01:33:51.043 --> 01:33:52.892
would you please take
this out to the car

01:33:52.953 --> 01:33:54.268
and give it to Carl? Thanks.

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:28.698
Good luck in the exam.

01:34:32.198 --> 01:34:32.864
Thanks.

01:34:43.555 --> 01:34:45.012
Oh, oh, oh. I got it.

01:34:45.837 --> 01:34:47.950
Here, take this one.
Careful, it's fragile.

01:34:49.356 --> 01:34:49.925
I got it.

01:34:54.285 --> 01:34:56.227
Put Gloria's in first.
Mum's too.

01:34:56.478 --> 01:34:58.656
Put mine in last
for easy access.

01:35:11.551 --> 01:35:12.284
Mom!

01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:31.320
Ass hole!

01:35:46.917 --> 01:35:48.003
Mr. McLeod!

01:35:50.002 --> 01:35:51.708
Mr. McLeod!

01:35:56.133 --> 01:35:58.150
I'm not allowed to
talk to you, Norstadt.

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.615
You have to go.

01:36:00.763 --> 01:36:02.508
No! No!

01:36:04.586 --> 01:36:05.498
I want to know!

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.794
You always want to know!

01:36:08.216 --> 01:36:09.572
I want to know the truth!

01:36:09.874 --> 01:36:11.934
Oh! About what in particular?

01:36:12.301 --> 01:36:13.872
Life? Religion?

01:36:14.039 --> 01:36:15.423
Why did you go to prison?

01:36:16.677 --> 01:36:19.644
I was convicted of
involuntary manslaughter.

01:36:19.791 --> 01:36:20.770
You can look it up.

01:36:22.579 --> 01:36:23.359
Did you?

01:36:23.992 --> 01:36:26.955
The boy in the car, the boy that died.
Did you molest him?

01:36:28.393 --> 01:36:29.830
What do you think, Norstadt?

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:32.520
Stop playing the teacher.
You just tell me!

01:36:33.383 --> 01:36:36.182
I think you've already made
your mind up, haven't you?

01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:41.032
Looks like I've fallen off that
pedestal you put people on.

01:36:41.093 --> 01:36:42.823
Strictly pass or fail, isn't it?

01:36:43.317 --> 01:36:45.470
I don't know what to think!
I don't understand!

01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:48.388
No! No!. You're just lazy, Norstadt!
I couldn't teach you a thing!

01:36:48.727 --> 01:36:51.381
-Just tell me!
-Did I ever abuse you?

01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:55.404
Did I ever lay a hand of
anything but friendship on you?

01:36:56.587 --> 01:36:58.309
Think, Norstadt, reason.

01:36:59.493 --> 01:37:00.116
Could I?

01:37:02.242 --> 01:37:04.155
Can you imagine
me ever doing so?

01:37:09.602 --> 01:37:10.772
And what about the past?

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:12.452
What do you see?

01:37:13.577 --> 01:37:15.405
Just tell me you didn't.
I'll believe you.

01:37:15.473 --> 01:37:16.492
No! No, sir!

01:37:17.405 --> 01:37:20.180
I didn't spend all summer so you
could cheat on this question.

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:31.156
I'm sorry.

01:37:32.403 --> 01:37:34.224
I didn't know what to think.
I'm sorry.

01:37:37.199 --> 01:37:38.243
It's all right, Charles.

01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:41.388
It's not your fault.

01:37:46.263 --> 01:37:47.639
You're a good student, Charles.

01:37:50.981 --> 01:37:52.339
You're a very good student.

01:38:04.369 --> 01:38:05.212
You better go.

01:38:12.482 --> 01:38:13.203
Goodbye.

01:38:16.379 --> 01:38:17.477
Sequari deum.

01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:42.957
Gentlemen, we're ready.

01:38:44.327 --> 01:38:45.172
Good luck.

01:39:10.079 --> 01:39:12.396
You have five minutes
left in section A.

01:39:13.081 --> 01:39:13.826
Five minutes.

01:39:24.118 --> 01:39:25.059
Pencils down.

01:39:26.985 --> 01:39:27.931
In section B,

01:39:28.618 --> 01:39:31.541
you will translate the
passage from Cicero,

01:39:32.102 --> 01:39:34.205
on the value and
nature of friendship.

01:39:34.898 --> 01:39:35.800
Pencils ready...

01:39:38.009 --> 01:39:38.723
Begin.

01:39:51.184 --> 01:39:53.451
Mr. McLeod, I'd
like to introduce

01:39:53.942 --> 01:39:55.829
Miss Fletcher from
Children's Aid,

01:39:56.446 --> 01:39:59.222
Dr Talbot, Judge Sinclair,

01:40:00.123 --> 01:40:02.160
Mr. McDowell from
the DA's office.

01:40:03.733 --> 01:40:06.428
Is your legal counsel not
with you this morning?

01:40:08.321 --> 01:40:11.504
I was told that this was an informal meeting.
Isn't that right?

01:40:11.738 --> 01:40:14.449
Oh, no, no, no. That's uh...
that's correct.

01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:16.938
All right. William,
why don't you begin?

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.446
Why didn't you go to the
mother and make sure

01:40:21.507 --> 01:40:23.302
that Charles had told
her about the tutoring?

01:40:24.248 --> 01:40:24.903
Because I...

01:40:27.826 --> 01:40:29.684
You've never taught,
have you, Mr McDowell?

01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:32.132
Taught? No. No.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.850
You can't teach a thing without
giving away your trust.

01:40:37.537 --> 01:40:38.516
I don't think I follow.

01:40:41.151 --> 01:40:42.909
Let's say I was teaching you,

01:40:43.481 --> 01:40:44.657
as a lawyer, to be honest.

01:40:46.571 --> 01:40:48.630
I couldn't trust you
to tell the truth,

01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:50.689
and then run round
to the courtroom

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:52.932
to see whether or not you
were lying, could I?

01:40:54.011 --> 01:40:56.480
Not unless I was absolutely
sure that you were lying.

01:41:02.476 --> 01:41:05.026
Perhaps you should tell
us about Patrick Scott.

01:41:06.186 --> 01:41:07.445
What would you like to know?

01:41:08.626 --> 01:41:10.046
Whatever you feel is relevant?

01:41:11.755 --> 01:41:12.312
Nothing.

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:15.936
Please, humour me.

01:41:18.351 --> 01:41:20.248
Patrick was an
outstanding student.

01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:22.734
He could have done anything.
Been anything.

01:41:24.092 --> 01:41:25.404
He was also very troubled.

01:41:27.694 --> 01:41:29.940
He was from a broken
home, full of

01:41:30.454 --> 01:41:31.944
guilt and violent fantasies.

01:41:32.198 --> 01:41:33.915
Not unlike the
profile of Charles.

01:41:34.043 --> 01:41:36.529
No, not unlike it. He too had a

01:41:36.942 --> 01:41:38.575
hard time with authority.

01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:40.327
I was one of the few adults,

01:41:40.388 --> 01:41:42.580
if not the only one,
that he connected with.

01:41:44.723 --> 01:41:46.324
He developed a fixation with me

01:41:46.558 --> 01:41:48.201
that I didn't know
how to deal with.

01:41:49.689 --> 01:41:51.706
I was 26. I didn't know a thing.

01:41:53.492 --> 01:41:55.087
When I did confront him with it,

01:41:55.277 --> 01:41:57.895
on the way back
from Boston, I was

01:41:58.389 --> 01:41:59.529
too frank, too hard.

01:42:01.146 --> 01:42:02.781
He became enraged, desperate.

01:42:03.575 --> 01:42:05.565
tried to step from the
vehicle into the highway.

01:42:05.772 --> 01:42:07.738
That's not exactly
what the jury found.

01:42:08.347 --> 01:42:10.827
Well, you asked me what I
knew of Patrick Scott,

01:42:11.396 --> 01:42:13.105
not what the jury
thought it found.

01:42:14.091 --> 01:42:16.436
But you did lose your job
because of the conviction?

01:42:16.602 --> 01:42:18.002
Yes, I lost my position.

01:42:18.092 --> 01:42:19.055
Then why,

01:42:19.568 --> 01:42:22.255
ten years later, would you
pick a strange boy as a pupil?

01:42:23.813 --> 01:42:24.964
Second chance.

01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:28.567
Charles needed my help.

01:42:28.628 --> 01:42:30.908
I guess I needed his too.

01:42:33.744 --> 01:42:34.993
How would you define 'needed'?

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.449
I'm a teacher, Dr Talbot.

01:42:37.749 --> 01:42:40.066
I make my living otherwise,
but I'm a teacher.

01:42:40.817 --> 01:42:42.037
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

01:42:42.164 --> 01:42:45.304
Mr. Mcleod, you were expelled
from the profession.

01:42:45.534 --> 01:42:48.445
I'm not talking about
a piece of paper.

01:42:49.378 --> 01:42:52.168
I'm talking about a
moment of grace.

01:42:55.354 --> 01:42:58.150
A moment to prove that I
could do it well and true.

01:42:59.290 --> 01:43:00.123
And did you?

01:43:01.194 --> 01:43:01.846
Yes.

01:43:02.753 --> 01:43:04.110
Charles is a good student.

01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:06.657
You're very fond of him.

01:43:09.121 --> 01:43:10.576
Yes, I'm very fond of him.

01:43:11.317 --> 01:43:13.355
As fond of you were
of Patrick Scott?

01:43:14.249 --> 01:43:16.019
No, Doctor. Much closer.

01:43:16.919 --> 01:43:17.997
Is that my crime?

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.701
Is that what I'm accused of?

01:43:19.762 --> 01:43:21.465
No one's accusing you of anything, Mr.
Mcleod.

01:43:21.526 --> 01:43:23.274
We're simply interested
in finding out the truth.

01:43:23.335 --> 01:43:25.268
God! I wish you were!

01:43:25.329 --> 01:43:26.242
-I beg your pardon?

01:43:26.411 --> 01:43:28.447
You're interested in the
appearance of the truth.

01:43:28.844 --> 01:43:30.124
And to skim on it's teeth.

01:43:30.597 --> 01:43:33.083
The truth is you haven't the
slightest comprehension

01:43:33.144 --> 01:43:35.070
what bond of friendship
someone like me

01:43:35.131 --> 01:43:36.654
could have with
Charles Norstadt.

01:43:36.957 --> 01:43:39.455
-Perhaps you could enlighten us?
-No. I don't think I can.

01:43:40.362 --> 01:43:43.310
And the tragedy of that is,
I don't know why I can't.

01:43:45.082 --> 01:43:45.875
Is it this?

01:43:47.302 --> 01:43:48.313
Is this what you see?

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.612
I assure you, it is human.

01:43:54.369 --> 01:43:56.177
If that's all you
see, well then...

01:43:56.823 --> 01:43:57.799
you don't see me.

01:44:00.041 --> 01:44:00.975
You can't see me.

01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:09.432
Perhaps we all need
a short recess.

01:44:09.992 --> 01:44:11.148
When you charge me,

01:44:11.788 --> 01:44:12.807
what will happen to Charles?

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.862
Mr. McLeod, no-one has...

01:44:14.923 --> 01:44:15.902
Will he have to testify?

01:44:16.017 --> 01:44:16.880
This panel...

01:44:16.941 --> 01:44:19.279
Will he be examined,
tested, probed?

01:44:19.475 --> 01:44:20.549
That's enough!

01:44:22.152 --> 01:44:25.617
Obviously the boy will be involved.
That goes without saying.

01:44:28.006 --> 01:44:30.751
Your implication that this
is some sort of violation

01:44:30.812 --> 01:44:32.420
is offensive in the extreme!

01:44:33.783 --> 01:44:35.037
Do I make myself clear?

01:44:36.701 --> 01:44:37.997
I apologise.

01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:42.132
And I assure you that I
am willing to cooperate

01:44:42.662 --> 01:44:45.489
with any course you feel
necessary to resolve

01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:48.625
our problem with
fairness and discretion.

01:44:51.712 --> 01:44:52.272
Thank you.

01:45:18.915 --> 01:45:19.445
Walker...

01:45:19.628 --> 01:45:20.105
Yes, sir?

01:45:20.166 --> 01:45:21.173
I think it's from your mother.

01:45:22.946 --> 01:45:24.130
Mr. Smith-Baker.

01:45:24.264 --> 01:45:25.036
Sir.

01:45:26.164 --> 01:45:26.842
Mr. Gablon.

01:45:27.082 --> 01:45:27.741
Thank you, sir.

01:45:28.011 --> 01:45:28.878
Mr. Norstadt.

01:45:28.939 --> 01:45:29.520
Yes, sir.

01:45:29.735 --> 01:45:31.350
Norstadt. Check the
address on that.

01:45:32.318 --> 01:45:33.835
Mr. Libby. Libby Bean.

01:45:35.148 --> 01:45:35.742
Cody.

01:45:36.827 --> 01:45:37.447
Dave.

01:45:41.528 --> 01:45:42.895
-Burt.
-Thank you sir.

01:46:05.483 --> 01:46:06.134
Hop in!

01:46:40.165 --> 01:46:41.147
'Hello, Norstadt.

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.989
I'm sorry, but I'm not
allowed to see you.

01:46:45.849 --> 01:46:47.123
'I'm not allowed to talk to you,

01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:49.128
I'm not allowed to
write you this letter.

01:46:50.584 --> 01:46:54.125
'These are my concessions
and their conditions...

01:46:55.351 --> 01:46:57.936
'..or, what I hope any
good teacher would call

01:46:57.997 --> 01:47:01.534
'a lesson in the tender
mercies of injustice'.

01:47:03.359 --> 01:47:05.530
'But, strangely, this is
nothing to grieve over...

01:47:07.463 --> 01:47:08.736
'..because you know the truth,

01:47:09.745 --> 01:47:12.196
and I now know that you
can outgrow a part,

01:47:12.534 --> 01:47:13.481
even a sad one.

01:47:14.607 --> 01:47:15.517
'You taught me that.

01:47:17.494 --> 01:47:20.026
'You gave me what I never
expected to find again,

01:47:20.966 --> 01:47:23.174
a gift of your trust and love.

01:47:24.681 --> 01:47:26.894
'And nothing can take
that grace away.

01:47:29.217 --> 01:47:31.178
'The best is yet
to be, Norstadt,

01:47:32.745 --> 01:47:33.836
so do it well.

01:47:35.306 --> 01:47:38.863
'I remain, as ever, your
tutor, Justin McLeod.'

01:47:43.975 --> 01:47:47.125
Those who persevere in faith.

01:47:48.103 --> 01:47:49.178
Once again,

01:47:49.505 --> 01:47:52.178
congratulations on
achieving the goals

01:47:52.239 --> 01:47:55.539
set out before you
four years ago.

01:47:56.308 --> 01:48:00.571
Class of 1972... dismiss!

01:48:02.728 --> 01:48:04.645
'Everything was perfect.'

01:48:22.226 --> 01:48:23.084
Charles!

01:48:25.116 --> 01:48:27.811
Darling, I am so proud of you.

01:48:27.944 --> 01:48:28.657
Thank you, Mother.

01:48:28.939 --> 01:48:30.638
Charles, your mother
and I are pleased.

01:48:30.799 --> 01:48:31.627
Thank you, sir.

01:48:35.428 --> 01:48:37.577
We'll see you at dinner, honey!

01:48:37.953 --> 01:48:38.988
See you at eight!

01:48:40.611 --> 01:48:41.694
I'll see you guys later.

01:49:33.817 --> 01:49:35.831
'But there's always a
face before me now...

01:49:37.334 --> 01:49:39.438
somewhere beyond the
edge of the crowd.'
