TODAY IS SO TOTALLY AWESOME.

18:31.810 --> 18:36.415
COSMO, I WISH ALL FAIRY GOD KIDS
HAD A RULE-FREE DAY LIKE ME.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.883
- SORRY, TIMMY,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.385
NOT EVERY GOD KID
IS ABOVE THE RULES LIKE YOU.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.288
AND I'M GONNA USE EVERY OUNCE
OF MY RAZOR-SHARP FOCUS

18:43.355 --> 18:45.090
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.191
- FONDUE?

18:46.258 --> 18:48.160
- YAY!

18:50.629 --> 18:53.398
- NO GOD KID HAS TO FOLLOW
ANY OF THESE RULES.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.568
THERE, LET
THE RULE-FREE WISHING BEGIN.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.971
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA
WITH BREAKING NEWS.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.640
KIDS HAVE GONE CRAZY
AROUND THE WORLD.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.642
IT'S RAINING
SUSAN B. ANTHONY DOLLARS

19:03.709 --> 19:06.111
ON LITTLE
SUSAN C. ANTHONY'S HOUSE.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.913
SKINNY, LITTLE IRVING SCHAUB

19:07.980 --> 19:10.582
HAS JUST WON THE WORLD'S
STRONGEST MAN COMPETITION.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.785
- YAY, MY WISH CAME TRUE.

19:13.852 --> 19:17.356
- AND JUNIOR MISS UNIVERSE HAS
FALLEN HEAD-OVER-HEELS IN LOVE

19:17.422 --> 19:18.757
WITH THIS KID.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.260
AS IF BY MAGIC,
THE WORLD HAS BEEN PLUNGED

19:21.326 --> 19:23.495
INTO KID-RELATED CHAOS.

19:23.562 --> 19:24.596
- CHAOS?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.265
I LIKE IT.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.966
WAY LESS BORING.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.571
UH-OH.
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.751
- [screaming]

19:49.788 --> 19:51.623
- AH, COSMO, HELP!

19:51.690 --> 19:52.891
- RELAX, TIMMY.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.960
YOU JUST HAVE TO SHOW HIM
WHO'S BOSS.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.496
BAD RULES.
HEEL!

19:57.563 --> 20:00.032
AH!

20:00.098 --> 20:03.335
WELL, NOW WE KNOW
WHO'S BOSS.

20:03.402 --> 20:04.703
- [roars]

20:04.770 --> 20:06.572
DID THAT SCARE
YOUR TRICK-UPS AWAY?

20:06.638 --> 20:07.906
- [hiccups]

20:07.973 --> 20:09.508
- HEY, YOU DIDN'T
DO A TRICK THAT TIME.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.576
IT'S WORKING.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.010
- THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.046
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
JUST DISAPPEARED.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.681
[horn blaring]

20:15.747 --> 20:19.117
- HONEY, THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
IS IN OUR LIVING ROOM AGAIN.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.319
- OH.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.121
WELL, AT LEAST
COSMO MUST BE DOING OKAY.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.991
AFTER ALL, THE UNIVERSE HASN'T
FALLEN APART OR ANYTHING.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.426
[alarm blaring]

20:27.492 --> 20:30.228
- THAT IS MY "THE UNIVERSE
IS FALLING APART" SIREN.

20:30.295 --> 20:34.466
QUICK, POOF US TO TURNER'S.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.369
COSMO, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO THE RULES?

20:37.436 --> 20:39.037
- DON'T WORRY, COUSIN JORGEN.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.872
I'VE TOTALLY GOT THIS.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.642
AH!

20:43.709 --> 20:45.410
YOU ARE A BIGGER MORON
THAN I THOUGHT,

20:45.477 --> 20:47.179
WHICH IS
REALLY SAYING SOMETHING.

20:47.245 --> 20:50.549
- FIRST OF ALL, I'M THE SAME
SIZE MORON I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.451
SECOND OF ALL,
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED.

20:52.517 --> 20:53.919
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.420
- COSMO'S RIGHT FOR ONCE.

20:55.487 --> 20:56.755
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

20:56.822 --> 20:58.557
I USED THIS GREEN CRAYON
TO CHANGE THE RULES

20:58.624 --> 20:59.625
SO THERE WERE NONE.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.226
both: YOU DID WHAT?

21:01.293 --> 21:03.362
- HOW DARE YOU
BORROW MY GREEN CRAYON!

21:03.428 --> 21:05.430
- TURNER, BECAUSE OF YOU,

21:05.497 --> 21:07.866
KIDS EVERYWHERE ARE
MAKING WISHES WILLY-NILLY.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.303
EVERY RULE-FREE WISH
DESTABILIZES THE BOOK FURTHER.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.205
AND HERE IS
THE REALLY BAD PART:

21:13.271 --> 21:16.074
IF THE BOOK EXPLODES,
SO DOES THE UNIVERSE.

21:25.517 --> 21:26.618
- I'M SORRY.

21:26.685 --> 21:27.986
HOW DO WE STOP IT?

21:28.053 --> 21:29.554
- THE UNSTABLE MAGIC
FROM THE BOOK

21:29.621 --> 21:31.757
MUST BE CONTAINED
BY A VON STRANGLE.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.393
AND I AM NO CONDITION
TO DO IT.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.294
- BUT I AM!

21:36.361 --> 21:37.763
STAND BACK, COUSIN.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.097
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.933
- COSMO, NO!

21:42.000 --> 21:43.235
- I CAN'T HANDLE IT.

21:43.301 --> 21:46.371
AH!

21:46.438 --> 21:48.206
- YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO DO IT ALONE.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.008
QUICK, GRAB MY HALVES,

21:50.075 --> 21:53.578
AND WE WILL ATTEMPT
TO ABSORB THE MAGIC TOGETHER.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.746
EH!

22:01.553 --> 22:03.188
[both grunting]

22:03.255 --> 22:04.756
- I'M SLIPPING.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.059
- YOU CAN DO IT, COSMO.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.493
AFTER ALL,

22:08.560 --> 22:10.629
YOU'RE A...

22:10.696 --> 22:12.898
- SAY IT.
SAY IT.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.100
- A VON STRANGLE.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.135
- YES!
HE CALLED ME A VON STRANGLE.

22:17.202 --> 22:19.705
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!

22:19.771 --> 22:24.509
[grunting]

22:24.576 --> 22:25.944
NOW PULL.

22:36.722 --> 22:39.458
- [grunting]

22:39.524 --> 22:40.625
WOW.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.961
THAT SCARED THE TRICK-UPS
RIGHT OUT OF ME.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.565
FOR A LITTLE GUY, YOU'RE SHOWING
SOME BIG VON STRANGLE BRAVERY.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.533
- SAY IT.
SAY IT.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.968
- DON'T PUSH IT, COUSIN.

22:50.035 --> 22:50.969
- YOU SAID IT.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.171
FAMILY HUG.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.607
- COSMO,
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.576
- YEAH!
WE SAVED THE UNIVERSE.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.678
HIGH-FIVE, GUYS.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.480
- TIMMY TURNER,

23:01.546 --> 23:04.149
OF ALL THE IRRESPONSIBLE THINGS
YOU'VE EVER DONE--

23:04.216 --> 23:05.150
- EH!

23:05.217 --> 23:08.787
WANDA, I'VE GOT THIS ONE.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.222
- E-7.

23:10.288 --> 23:11.723
all: BINGO!

23:11.790 --> 23:14.092
[explosion]

23:14.159 --> 23:16.895
- THAT IS SOME FREAKY BINGO.
