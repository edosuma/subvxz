00:25.652 --> 00:28.320
How do you think
the world will end?

00:30.455 --> 00:33.191
If you knew the end
of the world was here,

00:33.225 --> 00:35.327
would you be at home
with your family

00:37.296 --> 00:39.599
in the only safe place you know?

00:41.366 --> 00:42.702
Or thought you knew?

00:45.370 --> 00:47.640
Or if the real enemy is
within the human heart,

00:50.242 --> 00:52.244
your own heart.

01:24.544 --> 01:26.278
Come on Crystal, really?

01:26.311 --> 01:28.146
Baby girl, come on.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.816
How come you not using
the one next to your room?

01:29.849 --> 01:31.784
The toilet
is stopped up again, Dad.

01:31.818 --> 01:33.285
Oh, know what?

01:35.555 --> 01:36.421
Come on!

01:37.724 --> 01:39.324
When I win this lottery.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.165
Is it that time of
the month again?

01:48.668 --> 01:49.535
Shit.

01:57.209 --> 01:57.877
Oh!

01:58.911 --> 01:59.779
Man.

02:11.691 --> 02:14.694
Man, it's like,
nobody cut the same.

02:16.663 --> 02:19.297
Today your lucky day.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.809
Junior!

02:32.411 --> 02:33.680
Junior!

02:42.989 --> 02:44.957
Sleeping on the goddamn job.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.764
For when you awake.

02:54.433 --> 02:55.935
Get your lazy sorry ass up.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.335
What do you want from me?

02:57.369 --> 02:59.639
I want you to stop lying.

02:59.672 --> 03:01.841
Boy, didn't I tell you to put
my barbecue grill together?

03:01.874 --> 03:03.475
Yeah.

03:03.508 --> 03:05.778
Then why you tell me
you did when you didn't?

03:07.446 --> 03:08.313
See.

03:09.015 --> 03:09.982
No!

03:10.016 --> 03:11.383
- No!
- Yeah.

03:11.416 --> 03:12.284
No!

03:13.619 --> 03:14.887
Didn't know you
could move that fast.

03:14.921 --> 03:16.488
Man, Dad, do you know how long

03:16.521 --> 03:18.858
it takes me to
upload this stuff?

03:20.425 --> 03:21.393
You know how long
it would take you

03:21.426 --> 03:22.260
to build my grill.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.001
You know what, Junior?

03:29.035 --> 03:30.636
You don't finish shit you start.

03:31.804 --> 03:32.739
Look man.

03:34.774 --> 03:36.508
It's your grill.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.944
You know what?

03:37.977 --> 03:39.645
I pay the bills around
this place, Junior.

03:39.679 --> 03:41.379
That's my food you eat.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.315
My electricity you wasting.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.984
That's my toilet you shit in,

03:45.017 --> 03:47.787
but you can't do one
thing I ask you to do.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.022
It's jackpot Sunday.

03:50.056 --> 03:51.557
I'm cueing.

03:51.591 --> 03:53.458
I want my goddamn grill built.

03:53.492 --> 03:54.359
Or what?

03:55.762 --> 03:57.362
Don't you tempt me.

03:57.395 --> 03:58.263
Don't tempt me.

04:02.101 --> 04:03.035
Don't you temp me.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.974
Don't you tempt me.

04:09.609 --> 04:10.843
And stop
slamming my doors.

04:37.435 --> 04:39.071
Who's that?

04:39.105 --> 04:41.506
Oh, uh, well, that's just
my brother's wife, Lupe.

04:41.541 --> 04:43.709
We're supposed to
get together today

04:43.743 --> 04:45.611
to start planning
for her baby shower.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.081
For lunch.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.917
Who be off they
goddamn mind banging

04:50.950 --> 04:52.885
on my door this
time of the morning?

04:55.955 --> 04:57.790
Good morning, sir.

04:57.824 --> 04:59.725
Didn't they pass
a law banning y'all

04:59.759 --> 05:01.828
from preaching door to door?

05:04.864 --> 05:07.533
Babylon the great has fallen

05:08.901 --> 05:13.906
and on this day when
the moon has darkened

05:15.473 --> 05:17.143
and the stars have
fallen from the sky,

05:17.176 --> 05:19.645
a great panic from the Lord
shall come down upon them.

05:21.013 --> 05:23.115
So that each will
lay hold on the hand

05:23.149 --> 05:25.517
of his fellow

05:25.551 --> 05:28.921
and then every
man's sword shall be

05:28.955 --> 05:30.690
against his brother.

05:32.424 --> 05:34.026
Get off my porch
before I call the police.

05:36.662 --> 05:38.396
You've been warned.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.799
The day of truth is here.

05:41.534 --> 05:43.035
Them your people.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.981
What you doing boy?

05:55.014 --> 05:57.183
Come here boy, what's
wrong with you.

05:57.216 --> 05:58.718
What, you done broke my TV?

06:00.186 --> 06:01.486
Hey, wait a minute, come here,

06:01.519 --> 06:02.889
you gettin' sick?

06:02.922 --> 06:04.422
Nah, just a little
something in my throat.

06:04.456 --> 06:05.858
Dreams are a reflection

06:05.892 --> 06:07.560
of the dreamer's inner world.

06:07.593 --> 06:09.528
Dreaming of death is common

06:09.562 --> 06:10.529
in people experiencing-

06:10.563 --> 06:11.731
- What else is on, Dad?

06:13.666 --> 06:14.834
Uh, nothing.

06:18.204 --> 06:19.404
I'm bored.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.041
Won't you go play outside.

06:22.074 --> 06:24.944
I don't have no
one to play with.

06:27.479 --> 06:28.147
Not yet.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.045
Wait a minute, man, come on.

06:59.078 --> 07:00.713
You got your hands all wrong.

07:00.746 --> 07:04.750
Look, get your hands
on the seams, right?

07:04.784 --> 07:06.218
Get the ball up.

07:06.252 --> 07:09.487
Elbow pointed toward the
rim, right there, ready.

07:09.521 --> 07:10.488
Now push it.

07:13.159 --> 07:14.994
Yeah.

07:15.027 --> 07:18.965
Cross Patch Road, 0933.

07:18.998 --> 07:21.133
33, 33, all units

07:21.167 --> 07:24.770
return to station
immediately, code three.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.181
Barbecued chicken!

07:43.889 --> 07:45.523
I know, right?

07:45.558 --> 07:47.960
Come on, man, we going inside.

07:49.628 --> 07:52.064
Why aren't
you all bouncy today?

07:53.866 --> 07:56.002
I'm just not really
in a bouncy mood.

07:56.035 --> 07:57.169
Oh, really?

07:57.203 --> 07:58.237
- Really.
- Okay.

08:00.006 --> 08:03.275
I just, well, I have something

08:03.309 --> 08:04.877
that I wanna talk to you about

08:04.910 --> 08:07.646
and I need you to be serious.

08:08.781 --> 08:13.786
Um, well, I'm missed my period.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.763
It's jackpot Sunday.

08:57.797 --> 08:59.198
The countdown continues

08:59.231 --> 09:01.634
to the biggest lottery
payout in U.S. history.

09:01.667 --> 09:06.205
One lucky winner will win $1
billion and counting folks.

09:06.238 --> 09:08.007
That's the count to be.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.643
It's Lotto fever
all over the south.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.878
In less than eight hours,

09:12.912 --> 09:15.114
the lucky single ticket
will be announced.

09:16.415 --> 09:17.683
News around the nation.

09:17.716 --> 09:18.584
Good evening.

09:19.652 --> 09:21.087
These pictures over my shoulder

09:21.120 --> 09:22.755
are from Chelyabinsk in Russia,

09:24.156 --> 09:25.724
the same location
that a meteor hit

09:25.758 --> 09:27.760
back in 2013.

09:27.793 --> 09:29.795
The residents are
now experiencing

09:29.829 --> 09:31.764
another phenomenon called

09:31.797 --> 09:35.034
a super charged
electrical rainbow storm.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.402
Yes, you heard me right.

09:36.435 --> 09:38.137
These images

09:38.170 --> 09:39.338
are from the International
Space Station.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.940
This huge system is-

09:42.775 --> 09:43.943
Hi, Mommy.

09:43.976 --> 09:45.144
Well, hey, baby.

09:46.412 --> 09:47.813
News around the nation.

09:47.847 --> 09:49.115
You okay?

09:49.148 --> 09:50.182
- I'm fine.
- A city under attack.

09:50.216 --> 09:51.717
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

09:53.119 --> 09:54.120
Hello, Ms. McGee.

09:54.153 --> 09:56.021
Hey, Marcos.

09:56.055 --> 09:56.922
Sorry.

09:57.823 --> 09:59.024
How's school?

09:59.058 --> 10:00.025
It's good, thank you.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.026
It's my last year, so.

10:04.363 --> 10:05.331
Hey, Mom?

10:05.364 --> 10:09.768
It's Lotto time.

10:09.802 --> 10:11.137
Did you see the sky outside?

10:11.170 --> 10:12.671
It looks kind of weird.

10:12.705 --> 10:14.373
Must be all the smog outside.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.076
Won't you quit now, sit
down before you fall out.

10:17.109 --> 10:18.711
Hey, baby girl.

10:18.744 --> 10:19.445
Did you make me
any veggie burgers?

10:19.478 --> 10:20.346
Yes.

10:20.379 --> 10:21.947
Awesome.

10:21.981 --> 10:23.082
Hello Mr. McGee,
how you doing?

10:23.115 --> 10:23.983
Where's Evan?

10:25.351 --> 10:26.952
Evan!

10:26.986 --> 10:29.722
He's not feeling good,
he's asleep upstairs.

10:29.755 --> 10:30.856
Did he eat too much?

10:31.790 --> 10:33.292
Nah, he'll be aight.

10:56.081 --> 10:58.150
- Uh-oh.
- Marcus.

10:58.184 --> 11:00.419
Dad, it's Marcos.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.155
Marcos, you eatin' cue?

11:03.189 --> 11:05.024
I love barbecue, Mr. McGee.

11:05.057 --> 11:06.158
Good, sit down.

11:06.192 --> 11:07.993
Make that boy a plate.

11:08.027 --> 11:09.461
We have a lot
of studying to do.

11:09.495 --> 11:11.297
Nonsense,
where is your manners?

11:11.330 --> 11:13.132
Ain't nothing going on around
here except celebrating.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.036
You've said that every
Sunday for the past 10 years.

11:17.069 --> 11:19.138
Yeah, but tonight.

11:19.171 --> 11:20.406
Tonight's my night.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.976
You say
that every Sunday.

11:29.782 --> 11:31.417
This is just like old times.

11:31.450 --> 11:34.153
The McGee family home
for dinner plus one.

11:36.055 --> 11:36.922
It's time.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.194
It's
Jackpot Sunday.

11:42.228 --> 11:43.829
The countdown continues

11:43.862 --> 11:46.098
to the biggest lottery
payout in U.S. history.

11:46.131 --> 11:51.103
One lucky winner will win
$1 billion and counting.

11:52.471 --> 11:54.039
Pops, why do you
hold onto that thing

11:54.073 --> 11:55.975
like it's precious from
"Lord of the Rings."

11:57.910 --> 12:00.980
Better than you
holding onto a job.

12:02.481 --> 12:05.784
You gonna do that
in front of company?

12:05.818 --> 12:08.387
Hello, America,
it's Todd Williams

12:08.420 --> 12:11.390
and today is Jackpot Sunday.

12:11.423 --> 12:13.192
What a week it's been.

12:13.225 --> 12:17.196
It is a world record
breaking $1 billion dollars.

12:19.566 --> 12:21.200
Whoa!

12:21.233 --> 12:22.569
Woo hoo!

12:22.602 --> 12:24.503
Y'all gonna be
asking me for diamonds

12:24.537 --> 12:25.838
and pearls after I win this
money, though, I know that.

12:25.871 --> 12:27.273
I just want the toilet fixed.

12:28.841 --> 12:31.076
Are you ready
for make history?

12:31.110 --> 12:31.977
Here we go.

12:33.613 --> 12:35.381
Evan gonna wake up to his
dad being a billionaire.

12:35.414 --> 12:37.483
Well, I'm ready,
so our first numbers,

12:37.516 --> 12:39.885
ladies and gentlemen are-

12:46.892 --> 12:48.827
What is this?

12:52.498 --> 12:55.301
Come on, you gotta
be kidding me.

12:57.970 --> 12:58.837
Not now.

13:00.172 --> 13:02.474
What, come on, this
can't be a test.

13:02.508 --> 13:04.443
Settle down before
you hurt yourself.

13:04.476 --> 13:05.612
And they better
not be billing me

13:05.645 --> 13:06.879
for this shit, either.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.447
Relax pop.

13:10.382 --> 13:12.017
Look.

13:12.051 --> 13:13.586
It's another one of
those Amber alerts.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.901
Man, it's on every channel.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.036
It's even on my tablet.

13:37.443 --> 13:38.911
This
is not a test.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.146
Repeat, this is not a test

13:41.180 --> 13:43.148
of the Emergency
Broadcast System.

13:44.483 --> 13:48.387
Under executive order 14962,

13:48.420 --> 13:51.223
a national state of
emergency has been declared

13:51.256 --> 13:53.492
by the President of
the United States.

13:53.526 --> 13:55.595
Is this some sort of a joke?

13:55.628 --> 13:57.029
Under article two.

13:59.465 --> 14:01.066
We're missing it.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.235
Martial law has been declared.

14:03.268 --> 14:05.237
Habeas corpus has
been suspended.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.673
Right to a trial by jury?

14:06.706 --> 14:08.140
Gone.

14:08.173 --> 14:09.007
Can they do that?

14:09.041 --> 14:10.342
They just did.

14:10.376 --> 14:11.377
A
mandatory 24-hour curfew

14:11.410 --> 14:12.945
has been issued.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.913
Stay in your homes.

14:14.947 --> 14:16.081
Looters will be shot.

14:16.115 --> 14:18.016
Shot?

14:20.953 --> 14:22.321
We're missing
it again, fix it.

14:22.354 --> 14:23.055
This
is not a test.

14:23.088 --> 14:24.022
Wait.

14:24.056 --> 14:25.023
It's on again.

14:25.057 --> 14:26.024
This is-

14:47.580 --> 14:48.447
Okay.

14:49.549 --> 14:50.650
Okay.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.284
It was just a power surge.

14:53.218 --> 14:54.654
Okay.

14:54.687 --> 14:55.655
Yeah, Mr. McGee,
it looks like one

14:55.688 --> 14:56.656
of those brownouts.

14:56.689 --> 14:59.358
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.368
Okay, now what is this?

15:12.304 --> 15:15.307
It's like some
kind of a virus.

15:18.143 --> 15:19.445
All the lines are frozen.

15:21.146 --> 15:23.750
Okay, what could have happened

15:23.783 --> 15:25.685
that would have made them issue

15:25.718 --> 15:27.519
a nationwide state of emergency?

15:29.689 --> 15:31.023
Terrorist attack.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.392
It's the Illuminati.

15:33.425 --> 15:34.993
Junior!

15:35.027 --> 15:37.429
I'm telling you, look,
population control,

15:37.463 --> 15:39.465
the FEMA coffins,
it's the beginning

15:39.498 --> 15:40.399
of world genocide.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.537
Look, this is a false
flag operation, okay.

15:44.571 --> 15:46.238
"Black Ops" all the way.

15:47.607 --> 15:49.642
Out of chaos comes
new world order.

15:50.610 --> 15:51.711
It's the fourth Reich.

15:51.744 --> 15:53.312
Okay, you know what, stop it.

15:53.345 --> 15:54.781
Just stop it with all

15:54.814 --> 15:56.783
that YouTube conspiracy
theory bullshit, Junior.

15:56.816 --> 15:58.116
I'm sick of it.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.552
Man, why is it bullshit, Pop?

15:59.586 --> 16:01.186
You know what, they
let you post, right?

16:01.220 --> 16:02.321
Yeah.

16:02.354 --> 16:03.590
Okay, then it's bullshit.

16:12.665 --> 16:13.533
Junior!

16:37.089 --> 16:38.457
Junior!

16:38.490 --> 16:39.358
Boy, you gonna
get yourself shot.

17:00.747 --> 17:01.848
There ain't a nickel
worth of sense

17:01.881 --> 17:03.181
between the three of y'all.

17:03.215 --> 17:04.349
Get back in this house!

17:10.155 --> 17:11.189
Spooky shit, huh?

17:27.607 --> 17:29.107
Dang, you see that?

17:34.479 --> 17:36.114
I got, I gotta go, I love you.

17:36.148 --> 17:38.618
No, no, you promised
you wouldn't leave us.

17:50.863 --> 17:51.831
How's Evans?

17:51.864 --> 17:53.700
I'm worried.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.768
He's resting again, but
he's still got a high temp.

17:55.802 --> 17:58.303
I gave him something to
try and break the fever.

18:02.909 --> 18:05.645
What are you doing?

18:07.245 --> 18:08.648
Where are
the moon and stars?

18:08.681 --> 18:11.350
I don't
know, they there.

18:26.833 --> 18:27.900
Oh, my God.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.238
Glen!

18:33.271 --> 18:34.373
Go back inside.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.374
What happened?

18:35.407 --> 18:36.508
Go back inside.

18:36.542 --> 18:37.944
What happened?

18:37.977 --> 18:40.680
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, he's hurt.

18:42.481 --> 18:45.350
We've gotta get
him to a hospital.

18:46.653 --> 18:47.787
It's coming, it's coming.

18:47.820 --> 18:48.788
What's coming?

18:48.821 --> 18:50.222
It's coming.

19:22.689 --> 19:23.556
Glen!

19:24.423 --> 19:25.825
What?

19:25.858 --> 19:27.727
Is this about the
emergency broadcast?

19:27.760 --> 19:29.529
What broadcast?

19:29.562 --> 19:30.997
You didn't hear?

19:31.030 --> 19:32.330
Yeah, martial law,
Unc, we on lockdown,

19:32.364 --> 19:33.498
the whole country.

19:33.533 --> 19:34.701
I gotta get to Mama and Lupe.

19:34.734 --> 19:35.702
No.

19:35.735 --> 19:36.703
I gotta get to them.

19:36.736 --> 19:37.704
I gotta get to them.

19:37.737 --> 19:39.672
No, let him sit down.

19:39.706 --> 19:41.406
Please.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.542
Please.

19:48.548 --> 19:50.016
Glen, please.

19:50.049 --> 19:52.384
That's why they're here.

19:53.786 --> 19:57.322
After all these years,
it's finally here.

19:58.390 --> 20:00.258
Like a thief in the night.

20:00.292 --> 20:00.960
No.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.428
No.

20:03.462 --> 20:04.931
It can't be.

20:04.964 --> 20:06.498
No.

20:06.532 --> 20:07.800
He high again.

20:09.535 --> 20:10.670
You!

20:10.703 --> 20:13.438
Oh, no, no, stop him.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.274
You finally gonna get yours.

20:16.308 --> 20:18.811
You finally gonna get
yours, you're demons.

20:18.845 --> 20:19.679
You servant.

20:19.712 --> 20:21.379
It's coming.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.049
It's coming.

20:23.082 --> 20:25.718
40 days and 40 nights
it's gonna rain on y'all.

20:25.752 --> 20:27.587
You gonna get yours.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.055
You demon.

20:29.088 --> 20:30.288
You a demon.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.394
That's them drugs.

20:43.468 --> 20:44.604
What did you see man?

20:45.972 --> 20:47.073
Anything about a
poisonous attack,

20:47.106 --> 20:48.708
some kind of chemical weapon?

20:48.741 --> 20:50.610
Where'd
you hear that?

20:50.643 --> 20:51.744
Cindy.

20:51.778 --> 20:53.646
She's stationed in Fort Bragg

20:53.679 --> 20:55.081
and before she could get
out, her cell phone died.

20:55.114 --> 20:56.616
Well, what
about the countdown,

20:56.649 --> 20:57.482
anybody know
anything about that.

20:58.785 --> 21:01.453
Y'all see that?

21:01.486 --> 21:02.755
It's coming.

21:02.789 --> 21:03.756
It's coming.

21:03.790 --> 21:04.791
It's coming.

21:15.835 --> 21:17.937
Let's get all
together, get the kids.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.739
- What?
- Come on.

21:19.772 --> 21:20.773
Leave?

21:20.807 --> 21:22.374
We gotta go now.

21:22.407 --> 21:23.943
My family ain't going
nowhere without me.

21:23.976 --> 21:26.378
Come on, in the house right now.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.512
Carmen, now!

21:29.682 --> 21:30.650
Go inside.

21:30.683 --> 21:32.652
What should we do?

21:32.685 --> 21:33.853
Pray.

21:33.886 --> 21:34.754
Pray.

21:36.521 --> 21:37.924
Glen.

21:37.957 --> 21:38.825
Glen.

21:40.993 --> 21:42.094
Glen!

21:42.128 --> 21:44.630
In the house now!

22:01.814 --> 22:04.016
Just stay away from the windows.

22:04.050 --> 22:07.787
All right, just stay
away from the windows.

22:47.927 --> 22:48.928
Hey, Junior!

22:57.570 --> 22:58.436
Junior!

23:10.583 --> 23:12.218
What you need, Pop?

23:12.251 --> 23:13.786
Okay. Look man.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.957
I'm a need you not
to be Junior tonight.

23:23.062 --> 23:24.030
What is that supposed to mean?

23:24.063 --> 23:26.933
You know what it mean.

23:30.903 --> 23:31.837
Okay, pray.

23:35.908 --> 23:36.776
I got you.

23:39.612 --> 23:40.478
Okay.

23:50.056 --> 23:52.091
Martial
law has been enacted.

23:52.124 --> 23:53.826
Stay in your home.

23:53.859 --> 23:56.529
Mandatory 24-hour
curfew is in effect.

23:58.965 --> 24:01.233
All we gotta do is sit tight

24:01.267 --> 24:03.202
until this is over.

24:03.235 --> 24:06.806
And what happens when
what's going on gets here?

24:06.839 --> 24:08.975
It ain't gonna never
get here, baby girl.

24:11.043 --> 24:14.213
They always let them burn
down they own neighborhood.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.781
Who is them, Dad?

24:17.183 --> 24:18.050
He means me.

24:18.985 --> 24:20.686
If the shoe fit,

24:20.720 --> 24:21.687
you can wear that
motherfucker all the way home.

24:21.721 --> 24:22.822
Clarence.

24:22.855 --> 24:24.056
Don't Clarence me.

24:24.090 --> 24:25.591
Don't pay him any mind.

24:25.624 --> 24:27.660
You're not going
anywhere, Marcos, okay.

24:27.693 --> 24:29.061
You better not.

24:29.095 --> 24:30.796
Martial
law has been enacted.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.098
Stay in your home.

24:32.131 --> 24:34.166
Mandatory 24-hour curfew.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.671
Stay in your home.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.783
Mom, what was Uncle
Glen talking about?

24:52.918 --> 24:54.220
I would have to get my Bible.

24:54.253 --> 24:56.989
Here we go with that bullshit.

24:59.925 --> 25:01.727
For you yourselves
know very well

25:01.761 --> 25:03.596
that God's day is coming,

25:03.629 --> 25:05.531
exactly as a thief in the night.

25:09.635 --> 25:11.303
It will be instantly upon them,

25:11.337 --> 25:14.273
just as the pangs of
distress of a pregnant woman.

25:18.677 --> 25:19.912
And they will not escape.

25:28.888 --> 25:30.856
Martial
law has been enacted.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.658
Stay in your homes.

25:32.691 --> 25:35.961
A mandatory 24-hour
curfew is in effect.

25:37.396 --> 25:40.666
Mom, do you think
this is from God?

25:45.738 --> 25:48.240
I think that as
long as we stay inside

25:48.274 --> 25:51.243
and together, we're safe.

25:53.112 --> 25:54.647
That's one thing your
crack head brother got right.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.390
You never could cut
him any slack, could you?

26:04.423 --> 26:07.293
Not when he got his life
together, got married,

26:07.326 --> 26:10.329
bought a home, became
a longshoreman.

26:12.031 --> 26:13.365
Once an addict,
always an addict.

26:15.167 --> 26:17.670
Yeah, and you'd know
about that, wouldn't you.

26:17.703 --> 26:19.171
He didn't have to come by here

26:19.205 --> 26:20.806
and warn us, you know.

26:20.840 --> 26:24.076
He has his own family
to worry about.

26:26.679 --> 26:28.647
That nigga stole my TV.

26:43.162 --> 26:44.997
What happens when
it reaches zero?

27:02.882 --> 27:04.216
How's he doing?

27:04.250 --> 27:05.851
He's burning up.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.824
I think we should
get him to a doctor.

27:11.857 --> 27:12.725
Yeah.

27:14.093 --> 27:17.696
Little man's hot, okay,
come on, let's go.

27:21.767 --> 27:23.302
Oh, there go the Martinezes.

27:23.335 --> 27:25.171
Man, they pack fast.

27:26.739 --> 27:28.274
They got their whole
house on they car.

27:28.307 --> 27:30.342
We'd be leaving,
too, if we were smart.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.245
To where?

27:33.279 --> 27:35.247
I don't know, but
sitting here is just dumb.

27:35.281 --> 27:36.448
We should just go
check on your family

27:36.482 --> 27:38.083
and then head to Uncle Glen's.

27:39.218 --> 27:40.786
Oh, oh.

27:40.819 --> 27:43.055
Mr. Martinez is
getting out his car.

27:43.088 --> 27:44.723
Somebody 'bout to get
cussed out in Spanglish.

27:53.866 --> 27:55.434
We gotta get
him to a hospital.

27:55.467 --> 27:56.902
Where's my keys?

27:59.438 --> 28:01.006
Oh, shit!

28:01.040 --> 28:02.107
Oh, shit, man, they
just shot Mr. Martinez.

28:02.141 --> 28:03.242
Who did?

28:03.275 --> 28:04.310
Whoever he was arguing with.

28:07.012 --> 28:08.781
Shit, no, man, he just
shot him in the head.

28:08.814 --> 28:10.316
Call the police.

28:10.349 --> 28:11.483
Get away from the window.

28:11.517 --> 28:12.952
Get your ass away.

28:12.985 --> 28:14.987
Get out of the car!

28:15.020 --> 28:17.056
Ortiz, get the
fuck outta the car.

28:22.194 --> 28:23.929
They still in there.

28:30.102 --> 28:30.970
Junior.

28:32.404 --> 28:34.073
- What's wrong you?
- Dad!

28:34.106 --> 28:37.076
No, Junior, do you
want that to be us?

28:39.245 --> 28:42.549
Do you want that
to be us out there?

28:42.582 --> 28:43.449
Us.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.057
Come here.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.794
Stay down, stay down.

28:57.463 --> 28:58.464
Get in here.

28:59.566 --> 29:00.432
Get down.

29:04.303 --> 29:05.237
Get down.

29:12.177 --> 29:14.113
We gotta stay away
from the windows.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.322
We not going anywhere.

29:23.355 --> 29:24.223
What?

30:07.266 --> 30:08.434
Do you hear that?

30:08.467 --> 30:09.335
What?

30:11.671 --> 30:12.539
Mom?

30:13.640 --> 30:14.506
Dad?

30:34.694 --> 30:35.894
Do you hear that?

30:36.596 --> 30:38.163
They're gone.

30:38.197 --> 30:40.499
The helicopters, the sirens.

30:41.433 --> 30:43.035
It's really over?

30:43.068 --> 30:45.204
That's what I'm
talking 'bout, see?

30:45.237 --> 30:47.139
Police got everything
under control.

30:47.172 --> 30:49.208
Now everything'll be
back to normal soon.

30:49.241 --> 30:50.342
Now it's time to find out

30:50.376 --> 30:52.978
the numbers to the jackpot.

30:53.011 --> 30:54.913
I told y'all what today is.

30:54.947 --> 30:56.949
Is that seriously
all you care about?

31:02.354 --> 31:03.455
No.

31:03.489 --> 31:04.557
You know what else I care about?

31:05.592 --> 31:06.458
These ribs.

31:11.497 --> 31:12.632
And this corn.

31:14.433 --> 31:16.636
What if the countdown
was to mark an event?

31:18.203 --> 31:20.139
Yeah, but what kind of event?

31:21.206 --> 31:23.342
Yeah, yeah, the black Watson

31:23.375 --> 31:25.210
and the Latino
Sherlock Holmes now,

31:25.244 --> 31:27.714
is that what this is?

31:27.747 --> 31:28.947
Racist.

31:30.249 --> 31:32.217
I'm black, how
can I be racist.

31:32.251 --> 31:34.386
Duh, by being racist.

31:37.757 --> 31:38.625
No!

31:42.394 --> 31:43.996
Okay.

31:44.029 --> 31:45.464
Okay, I'm not sure
why I did that.

31:46.733 --> 31:48.400
Evan.

31:48.434 --> 31:50.302
Evan was the only
one who ate, right?

31:52.037 --> 31:53.606
Did anybody else
eat anything yet?

31:53.640 --> 31:55.642
I mean, what if
it was in the food

31:55.675 --> 31:56.643
or with the water?

31:56.676 --> 31:58.010
What was in the water?

31:58.043 --> 31:58.711
The poison.

31:59.712 --> 32:01.146
I mean the attack.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.981
The neighbor with the gas mask.

32:03.015 --> 32:04.349
Yeah?

32:04.383 --> 32:06.452
The only way to
carry out a mass attack

32:06.485 --> 32:08.420
would be through the
food or the water.

32:10.690 --> 32:12.291
Everything else would be,

32:12.324 --> 32:14.326
it would be too
limited, you know.

32:14.359 --> 32:15.494
He's right.

32:15.528 --> 32:16.629
It's better than putting cyanide

32:16.663 --> 32:18.397
in the Kool-Aid.

32:18.430 --> 32:19.732
I mean, you can
potentially kill millions

32:19.766 --> 32:21.333
with the right toxins.

32:30.409 --> 32:31.343
He is right.

32:31.376 --> 32:32.478
Daddy?

32:32.511 --> 32:34.079
What are you doing?

32:34.112 --> 32:36.081
Clarence, have
you lost your mind?

32:36.114 --> 32:37.416
You know who doing this?

32:37.449 --> 32:38.417
What are you talking about?

32:38.450 --> 32:39.485
Are you one of them?

32:42.254 --> 32:43.656
If I knew something,

32:43.690 --> 32:44.591
you think I would
be sitting here?

32:47.226 --> 32:48.695
Mom, please stop him.

32:50.295 --> 32:53.365
Clarence, you're
scaring everyone.

32:55.267 --> 32:59.171
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:46.786 --> 33:48.453
Where they going?

33:49.354 --> 33:50.422
They leaving.

33:52.559 --> 33:54.493
Looks like we just
became them, Dad.

34:13.646 --> 34:14.547
Who's out there?

34:17.650 --> 34:22.655
I know for damn sure
you know something

34:23.723 --> 34:24.323
about who's part of this.

34:28.427 --> 34:32.297
Mr. McGee, I'm guessing
like everyone else.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.432
You're a liar.

34:35.167 --> 34:36.569
You know how I know you lying?

34:37.937 --> 34:42.542
'Cause a liar knows
a liar and you lying.

34:46.244 --> 34:47.914
Pop, come on, man,

34:47.947 --> 34:49.682
Marcos doesn't have any
reason to lie, all right.

34:49.716 --> 34:51.918
He's got a full
scholarship to USC

34:51.951 --> 34:54.519
and I mean, he's the
smartest kid on the block.

34:54.554 --> 34:57.155
Yeah, but I know
he know something.

34:57.189 --> 34:58.758
No, let him go.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.194
You've gone too far.

35:03.596 --> 35:05.464
And he better start
telling it right now.

35:05.497 --> 35:08.467
I don't know
anything, dammit, come on.

35:09.535 --> 35:11.203
Dad, listen, please stop.

35:11.236 --> 35:13.205
No, no, no, Marcos
is, I'm pregnant.

35:15.675 --> 35:16.508
What?

35:16.542 --> 35:17.710
Dios mio.

35:17.744 --> 35:19.177
Crystal Marie.

35:19.211 --> 35:20.412
You?

35:20.445 --> 35:21.848
I'll blow your fuckin' head off.

35:21.881 --> 35:23.315
Dad, stop, please.

35:23.348 --> 35:24.951
Stay back.

35:24.984 --> 35:26.451
Dad.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.835
It started off as whispers.

36:02.722 --> 36:04.590
You better start
talking right now.

36:10.763 --> 36:12.665
They call themselves VOTV,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.301
Voices of the Voiceless.

36:17.704 --> 36:19.706
Yeah, I heard of them.

36:19.739 --> 36:21.674
New Age religious hacker group.

36:23.475 --> 36:25.310
These are some pill poppin',
weed smokin' anarchists

36:25.343 --> 36:26.546
ready to start some shit.

36:29.615 --> 36:31.416
I went to a meeting once.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.919
What? You got
invited to a meeting?

36:32.952 --> 36:34.554
You lucky.

36:34.587 --> 36:35.955
Yeah, they're
like all the rest

36:35.988 --> 36:38.658
of the political hounds
pimpin' the system.

36:38.691 --> 36:40.560
Nah, Mr. McGee, you
got it all twisted.

36:40.593 --> 36:43.663
See, these, these were no suits

36:43.696 --> 36:46.966
shaking down corporate
America for handouts.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.701
These were revolutionaries,

36:49.969 --> 36:51.269
a network of old school hippies

36:51.303 --> 36:53.405
that didn't cut their hair.

36:53.438 --> 36:55.407
Vatos who kept the
lokes and tats.

36:57.043 --> 36:59.612
Crypts and Bloods who never
stopped sagging they hat.

37:01.513 --> 37:03.716
Engineers, chemists,
drug lords, teachers.

37:05.051 --> 37:06.719
The dude standing
outside of Home Depot.

37:08.688 --> 37:10.790
They talked about an event
that would change the world.

37:10.823 --> 37:12.892
I didn't know what
they meant then.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.428
But I think I do now.

37:17.797 --> 37:19.899
So you saying this
countdown is what?

37:19.932 --> 37:21.333
Some kind of death clock?

37:22.668 --> 37:24.670
If anybody could
pull this off,

37:24.704 --> 37:26.572
it would be these guys.

37:28.340 --> 37:30.509
Yeah, I mean they
brought down the CIA site,

37:30.543 --> 37:32.645
held it for like 32 minutes.

37:32.678 --> 37:35.014
It leaked like 10 years
of classified information

37:35.047 --> 37:36.983
all over the web.

37:37.016 --> 37:37.884
Shit.

37:39.351 --> 37:41.386
Now, I don't know, but

37:42.722 --> 37:44.824
I remember they'd
always say one thing.

37:47.627 --> 37:48.493
It's coming.

37:52.098 --> 37:53.065
I'll be back.

37:53.099 --> 37:54.399
Where are you going?

37:54.432 --> 37:55.400
I gotta check on my family.

37:55.433 --> 37:56.836
I can get some answers.

37:56.869 --> 37:58.370
No, no, no, I'm
gonna come with you.

37:58.403 --> 38:00.840
No, you're not.

38:09.115 --> 38:11.083
It's too dangerous
for us out there.

38:13.019 --> 38:13.886
I love you.

38:14.821 --> 38:16.388
I love you, too.

38:27.133 --> 38:28.000
Wait.

38:44.717 --> 38:49.722
Now.

38:50.656 --> 38:51.791
I'll be back, I promise.

39:17.850 --> 39:20.052
Why didn't you wait until
you finished college first

39:20.086 --> 39:21.787
like we talked about?

39:21.821 --> 39:23.089
Why did we bother to
get the fucking pills

39:23.122 --> 39:24.522
if you were just gonna...

39:28.961 --> 39:30.596
Yeah, okay, she's pregnant.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.430
So what.

39:32.464 --> 39:33.900
I think we got bigger
things to worry about, Pop,

39:33.933 --> 39:36.434
like what's gonna happen
in the next 30 minutes.

39:38.104 --> 39:39.906
I would expect that out
of a lame brain like you.

39:44.110 --> 39:46.545
Your future is so bright.

39:46.579 --> 39:48.080
Marcos is a good
buy, I know that,

39:48.114 --> 39:50.049
but you have your whole
life ahead of you.

39:50.082 --> 39:51.416
Do I, Mom?

39:54.987 --> 39:56.722
Hear me out, baby girl.

39:59.558 --> 40:00.660
Life is like a puzzle.

40:03.529 --> 40:05.031
It's played one piece at a time.

40:06.632 --> 40:09.769
Daddy, I get that,
but it's my puzzle.

40:10.703 --> 40:11.570
Okay.

40:12.638 --> 40:14.573
But, some of these pieces,

40:14.607 --> 40:16.142
you only get one chance to play

40:17.877 --> 40:21.047
and how you play them affects
the rest of your life.

40:22.915 --> 40:25.117
Is this what you really want?

40:27.887 --> 40:28.988
I just don't want you to make

40:29.021 --> 40:30.723
the same mistake I did, sweetie.

40:31.791 --> 40:32.658
Mom, I'm not.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.528
I love Marcos.

40:37.964 --> 40:39.497
What you trying to say?

40:39.532 --> 40:41.567
Your mother and I
don't love one another?

41:37.790 --> 41:40.026
It's like a war out there.

41:47.967 --> 41:48.868
I'll take over.

42:11.824 --> 42:12.758
Hi.

42:14.126 --> 42:16.228
So I'm gonna be Uncle Evan?

42:20.332 --> 42:21.834
How did you know that?

42:23.369 --> 42:26.605
Y'all were fighting
and screaming loud.

42:26.639 --> 42:28.207
Shouldn't everyone be happy

42:28.240 --> 42:29.308
you're having a baby?

42:35.781 --> 42:37.850
I promise to share

42:37.883 --> 42:40.386
and show him how to
count to a hundred

42:40.419 --> 42:42.721
and teach him his ABCs.

42:44.824 --> 42:47.193
Well, what if he is a she?

42:47.226 --> 42:49.261
Then I will teach her, too.

42:49.295 --> 42:52.998
I just wanna be a
good uncle, the best.

42:54.066 --> 42:56.769
You'll do fine, I promise.

42:59.305 --> 43:01.674
He's still running a fever.

43:04.210 --> 43:05.678
Dad, it's hot in here.

43:05.711 --> 43:06.879
It's all right man,

43:06.912 --> 43:09.348
just stay laying
down, all right.

43:11.083 --> 43:13.219
I'm gonna take him
upstairs where it's cooler.

43:13.252 --> 43:15.354
I got it, Mom, it's fine.

43:15.387 --> 43:17.089
Okay.

43:17.123 --> 43:17.990
Thanks.

43:30.736 --> 43:32.037
Pops.

43:32.071 --> 43:33.939
What about the
generator you bought?

43:35.241 --> 43:36.742
What generator?

43:36.775 --> 43:38.444
The one from Y2K.

43:38.477 --> 43:41.380
It's brand new, still in
the box, never used it.

43:41.413 --> 43:42.948
Remember back when you believed

43:42.982 --> 43:44.283
in conspiracy theories.

43:44.316 --> 43:46.352
Yeah, but that was different.

43:46.385 --> 43:47.253
How?

43:49.021 --> 43:50.856
Let's go get this
gennie, come on.

43:50.890 --> 43:53.893
Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't
want you going out there.

43:53.926 --> 43:56.695
Somehow we gotta
find out what's going on.

43:57.963 --> 43:59.798
Yeah, Pops is right.

43:59.832 --> 44:02.034
It'll be all right, Mom,
we'll be right back.

44:32.198 --> 44:34.066
You know where it is?

44:34.099 --> 44:36.001
How am I supposed
to know that?

44:37.136 --> 44:38.070
Really?

44:40.172 --> 44:41.774
Shit.

44:41.807 --> 44:43.075
You bought it.

44:52.985 --> 44:54.220
All these boxes
packed up on top

44:54.253 --> 44:55.854
of one another.

44:55.888 --> 44:58.123
I thought I told you to
clean this place out?

44:58.157 --> 44:59.358
Man, this always
turns into something

44:59.391 --> 45:00.960
about me, man.

45:00.993 --> 45:02.094
I was just waiting on you.

45:02.127 --> 45:04.196
Hey, boy, be quiet.

45:04.230 --> 45:07.233
You always poppin'
off at the mouth.

45:14.006 --> 45:14.873
I'm sorry.

45:16.875 --> 45:17.743
What?

45:19.011 --> 45:19.878
You're right.

45:21.180 --> 45:22.848
I've been blaming you

45:22.881 --> 45:24.350
and you've been helping
me out a lot tonight

45:24.383 --> 45:26.518
and I'm really
proud of you, man.

45:26.553 --> 45:27.753
I mean that.

45:29.455 --> 45:32.224
It must be the
end of the world.

45:32.258 --> 45:35.361
See? That's that
bullshit right there.

45:36.895 --> 45:37.863
It's cool, Pop.

45:43.536 --> 45:44.503
Oh, hold up.

45:45.838 --> 45:48.874
Hey, this is a CB radio, right.

45:48.907 --> 45:50.242
We might be able to use this.

45:57.550 --> 45:59.918
Aw, sugar, sugar now.

45:59.952 --> 46:02.521
Pops, you thought
you had swag, huh?

46:03.455 --> 46:04.490
I still got swag.

46:16.235 --> 46:19.505
Maybe it's
up in this corner.

46:26.078 --> 46:27.479
You find anything?

46:37.189 --> 46:38.057
Wow.

46:50.369 --> 46:51.538
What you laughing at?

46:51.571 --> 46:53.573
Nothing, keep looking.

47:03.449 --> 47:05.451
Oh, found it.

47:23.268 --> 47:25.437
Did you know your
sister was pregnant?

47:30.309 --> 47:31.176
Yeah.

47:32.277 --> 47:33.145
We talked.

47:35.180 --> 47:36.048
Y'all talk?

47:37.483 --> 47:39.552
Yeah, I mean,
that's what brothers

47:39.586 --> 47:40.587
and sisters do, Pop.

47:43.021 --> 47:45.023
I told her she should wait,

47:45.057 --> 47:47.359
but she just like you
and mom, hard headed.

47:54.066 --> 47:56.268
I can't move this
thing by myself.

47:59.739 --> 48:00.939
Yeah.

48:17.489 --> 48:18.457
What is this?

48:18.490 --> 48:20.492
Oh, it's a CB.

48:20.527 --> 48:22.161
Stands for citizen's band radio,

48:22.194 --> 48:23.128
you know, like the
truck drivers use.

48:23.162 --> 48:24.564
Oh, okay.

48:26.633 --> 48:28.333
I think I got it.

48:28.367 --> 48:32.337
Ah, yeah, still works.

48:32.371 --> 48:35.374
So how far can you
reach out to people on it?

48:35.407 --> 48:36.275
Not that far.

48:37.342 --> 48:38.611
It's got 40 channels, though.

48:41.113 --> 48:43.315
Hello, hello, hello.

48:43.348 --> 48:45.250
Is anybody out there?

48:45.284 --> 48:46.653
Anybody hear me?

48:46.686 --> 48:48.487
Wait, that is not
how the truckers do it.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.988
Let me show you.

48:51.223 --> 48:52.625
Breaker, breaker 1-9er.

48:52.659 --> 48:56.061
This is Little Mama
speaking, do you copy?

48:58.464 --> 49:00.065
Is anybody out there?

49:04.203 --> 49:05.370
Shit, Pop.

49:05.404 --> 49:06.639
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

49:06.673 --> 49:08.541
Okay, you guys stay together.

49:08.575 --> 49:10.008
Junior, don't you leave them.

49:10.042 --> 49:11.243
Oh, my God, Evan.

49:11.276 --> 49:13.345
I got it, go, I got it.

52:36.015 --> 52:36.883
Come on!

52:37.817 --> 52:39.351
What do you want?

52:59.438 --> 53:00.305
Evan!

53:12.451 --> 53:13.820
Get the gun.

53:24.530 --> 53:25.665
Who are you?

53:28.835 --> 53:29.702
Talk.

53:29.736 --> 53:30.803
I can't talk.

53:31.871 --> 53:33.606
The grave has fallen.

53:35.307 --> 53:36.576
When the moon has darkened.

53:37.643 --> 53:39.377
A great panic from the Lord

53:39.411 --> 53:40.880
shall come down on them.

53:44.851 --> 53:46.719
There'll be no escape.

54:01.701 --> 54:02.869
What did he say?

54:04.904 --> 54:06.038
He said he was free.

54:24.389 --> 54:26.391
Get some towels, Junior.

54:28.528 --> 54:29.796
Get some towels.

54:40.540 --> 54:41.406
Daddy?

54:42.675 --> 54:44.043
Dad, what's wrong?

54:45.645 --> 54:46.511
Junior.

54:53.619 --> 54:54.486
Here.

55:12.071 --> 55:15.373
Junior, really, you
brought the white ones.

55:15.407 --> 55:16.742
Man, and I thought you told me

55:16.776 --> 55:18.343
you barricaded the back door.

55:19.178 --> 55:20.780
I mean, I did.

55:20.813 --> 55:22.582
Then why was it
left wide open?

55:22.615 --> 55:25.417
Man, I take back everything
good I said about you.

55:25.450 --> 55:26.786
Man, I don't know you
didn't fuckin' mean it anyway.

55:26.819 --> 55:28.654
When you gonna
grow up and be a man?

55:28.688 --> 55:29.689
You move.

55:29.722 --> 55:30.890
Mom!

55:30.923 --> 55:33.693
Dad,
stop it, please.

55:33.726 --> 55:34.827
Calm down.

55:34.861 --> 55:35.728
Junior!

55:37.663 --> 55:38.931
Junior!

55:38.965 --> 55:40.700
Calm down, please.

56:33.518 --> 56:34.854
Was it all bad?

56:37.223 --> 56:40.026
Do you
want the truth?

56:44.597 --> 56:45.463
Or the lie?

56:46.232 --> 56:47.099
The lie.

56:54.807 --> 56:56.242
We're living a lie.

56:56.275 --> 56:58.144
How about the
truth for a change.

56:58.177 --> 56:59.612
Okay, the truth.

57:03.149 --> 57:05.618
It's been hell every minute.

57:05.651 --> 57:07.820
How the hell can you say that?

57:07.853 --> 57:09.221
Man, I gave you everything.

57:09.255 --> 57:11.757
Everything you wanted to give.

57:11.791 --> 57:13.025
None of it was about me.

57:13.059 --> 57:14.160
You worked, you sweated,

57:14.193 --> 57:17.263
but it was all for you, all you.

57:17.296 --> 57:21.100
Okay, well, well now
I want that to change.

57:22.702 --> 57:23.836
The start of the
great tribulation

57:23.869 --> 57:26.205
and now you wanna change.

57:26.238 --> 57:28.841
It's never too late to change.

57:28.874 --> 57:30.176
Who fed you that lie?

57:31.744 --> 57:33.779
But the strange
thing about a lie?

57:33.813 --> 57:36.182
It always finds a way of
turning into the truth.

57:37.950 --> 57:41.654
One way or another, it's over.

57:43.856 --> 57:44.690
What?

58:06.178 --> 58:07.512
Was that a lie?

58:09.682 --> 58:10.549
No.

58:12.051 --> 58:14.687
But it was a long, long time ago

58:17.857 --> 58:19.759
when you and I were
different people.

58:22.762 --> 58:23.829
I love you, Carmen.

58:25.898 --> 58:28.234
And you and my kids.

58:29.735 --> 58:32.038
They're adults
now, except for Evan.

58:32.071 --> 58:33.172
My family.

58:38.077 --> 58:40.112
You mean more than anything

58:40.146 --> 58:42.114
in the world to me right now.

58:42.148 --> 58:45.651
Especially now, especially
now, especially now.

58:45.684 --> 58:47.086
You have to lose everything

58:47.119 --> 58:48.320
in order to feel alive?

58:48.354 --> 58:50.956
You're sicker than I thought.

58:50.990 --> 58:53.692
You haven't cared about
your family for 25 years.

58:53.726 --> 58:54.960
That's not true.

58:54.994 --> 58:56.796
Evan is the only one

58:56.829 --> 58:57.930
that you ever showed.

59:01.267 --> 59:02.201
What about Evan?

59:07.139 --> 59:08.707
Evan was the only one

59:08.741 --> 59:11.077
you ever showed that
you cared about.

59:12.211 --> 59:14.046
The rest of us you just starved

59:14.980 --> 59:16.282
until we withered away.

59:26.759 --> 59:28.794
Breaker, breaker
this is Lone Wolf.

59:29.728 --> 59:30.729
You copy Little Mama?

59:33.299 --> 59:34.867
Breaker, breaker Lone Wolf,

59:34.900 --> 59:36.202
this is Little
Mama, do you copy?

59:38.104 --> 59:39.305
Let me see, let me see.

59:39.338 --> 59:40.339
What's your 20?

59:41.807 --> 59:43.209
What are those?

59:43.242 --> 59:44.210
It's CB code.

59:46.045 --> 59:47.880
I'm trapped on
the Vincent Thomas bridge

59:47.913 --> 59:51.784
in a greasy side-up in this
goddamn chicken choker.

59:51.817 --> 59:54.854
What's he saying?

59:55.921 --> 59:57.389
He flipped over on his side

59:57.423 --> 1:00:01.060
and he was hauling chickens.

1:00:02.428 --> 1:00:04.230
I got hit by
a cowboy's Cadillac

1:00:04.263 --> 1:00:06.365
after he ran over
an organ donor.

1:00:08.434 --> 1:00:10.769
I got hit by a pickup truck

1:00:10.803 --> 1:00:13.906
that ran over a motorcyclist.

1:00:13.939 --> 1:00:15.141
Wait, are you for real?

1:00:16.275 --> 1:00:17.676
Copy that, Lone Wolf.

1:00:17.710 --> 1:00:18.711
Are you okay?

1:00:20.212 --> 1:00:21.814
Knee's all busted up.

1:00:23.115 --> 1:00:25.151
I'm not going
anyway anytime soon.

1:00:26.919 --> 1:00:28.254
Sure could use
some cactus juice.

1:00:28.287 --> 1:00:31.223
Cactus juice,
cactus juice, liquor.

1:00:32.491 --> 1:00:34.293
How you
holding up, Little Mama?

1:00:36.195 --> 1:00:40.933
We're holding, just me
and my family, scared.

1:00:40.966 --> 1:00:43.702
Ask him does he know
anything about an attack.

1:00:45.104 --> 1:00:46.906
Please, Lone Wolf, I
mean is there anything

1:00:46.939 --> 1:00:48.974
you can tell us about
what's going on, something?

1:00:50.342 --> 1:00:52.178
All I know
is I haven't slept

1:00:52.211 --> 1:00:55.481
or eaten in two days trying
to stay in front of it.

1:00:55.514 --> 1:00:58.250
Two days, I drove like the wind.

1:00:58.284 --> 1:00:59.885
In front of what, Lone Wolf?

1:01:01.086 --> 1:01:01.954
The fever.

1:01:03.322 --> 1:01:05.324
That's what I used to
call it back in Nam.

1:01:07.293 --> 1:01:12.131
People caught up,
swept into a frenzy

1:01:12.164 --> 1:01:14.700
of killed or be killed.

1:01:16.135 --> 1:01:18.137
God used it many
times in the past

1:01:18.170 --> 1:01:20.239
to destroy his enemies.

1:01:20.272 --> 1:01:23.876
Confusing them until
they killed themselves.

1:01:26.011 --> 1:01:29.481
Somewhere out there,
a spark was lit

1:01:29.515 --> 1:01:32.918
and it started a fire
in the hearts of man,

1:01:32.952 --> 1:01:35.754
a fever not of the
body, but the mind.

1:01:37.122 --> 1:01:40.159
For two days I stayed in
front of death's door,

1:01:40.192 --> 1:01:44.230
but now it's here knocking,
just like I dreamed.

1:01:45.565 --> 1:01:47.233
Are you in trouble, Lone Wolf.

1:01:48.801 --> 1:01:50.069
Aren't we
all Little Mama.

1:01:51.370 --> 1:01:52.504
I'm Crystal.

1:01:53.939 --> 1:01:55.040
I'm Rick.

1:01:55.074 --> 1:01:56.141
Nice meeting you, little lady.

1:01:57.309 --> 1:01:58.844
The button pushers are here.

1:02:03.816 --> 1:02:04.950
Troublemakers.

1:02:06.553 --> 1:02:09.121
You get out of there
now, Rick, do you hear me?

1:02:09.154 --> 1:02:11.023
Get out now Lone Wolf.

1:02:12.091 --> 1:02:13.892
Adios, Little Mama.

1:02:15.562 --> 1:02:17.229
Rick!

1:02:18.531 --> 1:02:19.398
Rick!

1:02:22.368 --> 1:02:24.837
He's only 15
minutes away from us.

1:03:11.116 --> 1:03:14.219
Oh, Evan, oh, my God.

1:03:15.387 --> 1:03:16.822
Your fever's broken.

1:03:19.626 --> 1:03:21.493
Who you waving to, sweetie.

1:03:21.528 --> 1:03:23.195
Mom, who is that?

1:03:25.197 --> 1:03:26.265
Oh, my God.

1:03:28.535 --> 1:03:30.570
Oh, come on sweetie.

1:03:34.106 --> 1:03:35.240
Who the hell is that?

1:03:38.043 --> 1:03:38.911
Carmen?

1:03:47.019 --> 1:03:49.154
Detective Jonathan
Little, LAPD,

1:03:49.188 --> 1:03:50.989
may I please come in.

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:54.326
Thank you, sir.

1:03:57.996 --> 1:04:00.432
So why
are you here Detective

1:04:00.466 --> 1:04:02.301
and what's going on out there?

1:04:04.036 --> 1:04:06.372
I wish I had more
information for you.

1:04:08.474 --> 1:04:10.509
But I'll tell you what I know.

1:04:12.111 --> 1:04:13.212
Crystal, sweetie,
could you take Evan

1:04:13.245 --> 1:04:14.980
to the other room, thanks.

1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:22.555
About six hours ago

1:04:22.589 --> 1:04:24.657
before we lost control
of the airwaves,

1:04:24.691 --> 1:04:26.191
a code three was sent out.

1:04:28.026 --> 1:04:30.530
It was from a secure line
from Homeland Security.

1:04:32.197 --> 1:04:35.033
It stated that 15 cities
from around the world

1:04:36.636 --> 1:04:40.305
for the past 30 days have
been systematically poisoned.

1:04:42.609 --> 1:04:43.942
How?

1:04:43.976 --> 1:04:45.210
The water, the air we breathe,

1:04:45.244 --> 1:04:46.512
the food that we eat.

1:04:47.614 --> 1:04:49.214
Marcos was right.

1:04:49.248 --> 1:04:51.885
L.A. was on top of
that list, I'm sorry.

1:04:54.486 --> 1:04:56.121
Somehow that cable got hacked

1:04:56.155 --> 1:04:57.322
and leaked onto the internet

1:04:57.356 --> 1:05:00.359
and it was run on the banks.

1:05:01.661 --> 1:05:04.163
Rumors became fact.

1:05:04.196 --> 1:05:05.330
This is the end.

1:05:06.432 --> 1:05:08.033
And we lost control.

1:05:11.571 --> 1:05:13.071
So why are you here?

1:05:17.109 --> 1:05:18.444
Junior, Crystal, can I speak

1:05:18.477 --> 1:05:21.313
with your parents in private.

1:05:23.081 --> 1:05:25.250
How do you know my
kids' names, Detective?

1:05:35.294 --> 1:05:36.763
It's a DNA test.

1:05:36.796 --> 1:05:38.464
It was taken six years ago.

1:05:44.771 --> 1:05:47.506
I know it's hard,

1:05:49.241 --> 1:05:50.476
but I have to see my son.

1:05:52.745 --> 1:05:54.614
I never wanted this.

1:05:54.647 --> 1:05:56.315
She's telling you the
truth when she says that.

1:05:57.684 --> 1:06:00.519
I wanted her to leave
your ass six years ago.

1:06:01.453 --> 1:06:03.021
We love each other.

1:06:03.055 --> 1:06:05.157
But she wanted to
stick it out for you,

1:06:05.190 --> 1:06:07.025
she said for the
sake of the family.

1:06:09.361 --> 1:06:11.096
Took a whole lot of
convincing for me

1:06:11.129 --> 1:06:13.398
not to come here before now.

1:06:13.432 --> 1:06:16.235
But when you got a piece
of you that's out there,

1:06:16.268 --> 1:06:17.670
you gonna see it through.

1:06:18.738 --> 1:06:20.272
I thought maybe I wasn't making

1:06:20.305 --> 1:06:22.441
the right decision
coming here before now,

1:06:24.343 --> 1:06:28.347
but living a whole life of
lies makes you wanna do right

1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:30.750
and there wasn't a day
in the past six years

1:06:30.783 --> 1:06:33.352
I didn't wake up regretting
making that decision.

1:06:40.425 --> 1:06:42.294
Sure is funny
how lies turn into

1:06:42.327 --> 1:06:45.097
the truth, huh, Carmen?

1:06:49.201 --> 1:06:52.237
It's hurts being
lied to, doesn't it?

1:06:57.644 --> 1:07:00.713
You let me believe
that he was mine

1:07:01.848 --> 1:07:05.552
for six fuckin' years?

1:07:05.585 --> 1:07:07.452
For six fuckin' years.

1:07:09.889 --> 1:07:11.189
Who was it for, Carmen?

1:07:11.223 --> 1:07:12.324
You deserve to know the truth.

1:07:12.357 --> 1:07:14.226
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

1:07:14.259 --> 1:07:16.729
Was it for you or was it for me?

1:07:16.763 --> 1:07:18.765
Who was it for?

1:07:18.798 --> 1:07:20.465
Get away from me.

1:07:21.901 --> 1:07:23.302
I wanna see my son.

1:07:24.604 --> 1:07:26.271
You come in my
fuckin' house tell me

1:07:26.305 --> 1:07:29.474
we all gonna die so
you can take my son.

1:07:29.508 --> 1:07:31.711
He ain't your son, Clarence.

1:07:33.211 --> 1:07:35.180
Six years I've driven
past this house

1:07:35.213 --> 1:07:36.883
hoping to get a
glimpse of my son.

1:07:36.916 --> 1:07:40.218
I'm gonna be the one to teach
him how to play basketball,

1:07:40.252 --> 1:07:41.854
not your ass.

1:07:43.388 --> 1:07:46.425
If this is all the time
I have with my son,

1:07:46.458 --> 1:07:50.830
I'm gonna spend it with
him right the fuck now.

1:07:53.231 --> 1:07:54.734
You think 'cause
you lay a little seed,

1:07:54.767 --> 1:07:56.501
that make you a father.

1:08:00.573 --> 1:08:02.307
Get the fuck outta my way.

1:08:05.945 --> 1:08:08.881
Don't deny Evan
what you never had.

1:08:08.915 --> 1:08:11.149
You
shut the fuck up.

1:08:11.183 --> 1:08:15.120
Clarence, let the
boy see his father.

1:08:26.431 --> 1:08:27.432
Thank you.

1:08:48.453 --> 1:08:49.388
Where you going?

1:08:51.323 --> 1:08:54.560
I have to be there
when he tells him.

1:09:10.877 --> 1:09:12.745
Dad, listen.

1:09:14.279 --> 1:09:15.915
We all knew, but we love you,

1:09:15.948 --> 1:09:17.282
we don't wanna hurt you.

1:09:18.951 --> 1:09:20.553
We just didn't wanna hurt you.

1:09:27.292 --> 1:09:27.960
Okay.

1:09:33.365 --> 1:09:34.299
You, too?

1:09:49.514 --> 1:09:50.382
Okay.

1:09:51.918 --> 1:09:53.251
It'll be okay.

1:09:54.654 --> 1:09:55.922
Sit down, Dad.

1:10:01.493 --> 1:10:03.361
Daddy, it's okay.

1:10:05.297 --> 1:10:06.933
Dad, please, stop.

1:10:10.870 --> 1:10:12.270
It's okay, Dad.

1:10:24.349 --> 1:10:27.553
Daddy, calm down please,
you're scaring me.

1:10:32.725 --> 1:10:34.727
Okay, okay.

1:10:35.895 --> 1:10:37.697
It's gonna be okay.

1:10:40.398 --> 1:10:41.333
I'm okay.

1:10:43.335 --> 1:10:44.003
Okay.

1:11:28.681 --> 1:11:29.549
Daddy.

1:11:30.850 --> 1:11:31.717
Daddy, no.

1:11:32.819 --> 1:11:33.653
Dad!

1:11:33.686 --> 1:11:34.554
Mom!

1:11:37.657 --> 1:11:40.425
You get your hands
off my wife and my kid.

1:11:40.458 --> 1:11:41.561
Clarence.

1:11:41.594 --> 1:11:42.628
Put the fuckin' gun down.

1:11:44.063 --> 1:11:45.598
This is my house.

1:11:46.666 --> 1:11:48.901
This is my wife and it's my son.

1:11:48.935 --> 1:11:51.403
He ain't your son.

1:11:51.436 --> 1:11:52.538
Please, please, don't do this,

1:11:52.572 --> 1:11:53.539
don't let this happen this way.

1:11:53.573 --> 1:11:54.941
Clarence, I'm sorry.

1:11:54.974 --> 1:11:57.577
Please, don't do this,
put the gun down.

1:11:57.610 --> 1:11:59.377
Daddy,
please stop it.

1:11:59.411 --> 1:12:00.079
Know what?

1:12:01.647 --> 1:12:06.085
Hopes and dreams are
built on three words.

1:12:07.119 --> 1:12:07.987
I love you.

1:12:10.522 --> 1:12:11.657
You betrayed me.

1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:14.961
All of y'all

1:12:18.064 --> 1:12:18.931
betrayed me.

1:12:22.568 --> 1:12:25.037
Put the fuckin' gun down now.

1:12:25.071 --> 1:12:26.806
Dad, please, stop.

1:12:29.775 --> 1:12:31.143
Come here.

1:12:31.177 --> 1:12:34.479
Come here little man, come on.

1:12:34.512 --> 1:12:35.380
Come on.

1:12:36.514 --> 1:12:37.382
Come on.

1:12:39.018 --> 1:12:40.119
Come to your dad.

1:12:52.464 --> 1:12:54.533
Come of your daddy, come.

1:13:14.887 --> 1:13:16.421
Come to your dad.

1:13:26.866 --> 1:13:28.200
Come to your dad.

1:13:29.802 --> 1:13:30.670
No.

1:13:33.839 --> 1:13:34.707
No.

1:13:41.013 --> 1:13:43.916
No.

1:13:43.950 --> 1:13:48.955
No, this is just how I dreamed.

1:13:49.889 --> 1:13:51.090
This is not happening.

1:13:51.123 --> 1:13:53.225
- No!
- No!

1:13:55.594 --> 1:13:56.461
Mom!

1:14:01.701 --> 1:14:02.702
Babe!

1:14:02.735 --> 1:14:03.602
Evan!

1:14:15.715 --> 1:14:16.549
Motherfucker!

1:16:05.124 --> 1:16:07.193
You can't have my family.

1:16:34.420 --> 1:16:35.888
I'm sorry, baby.

1:18:16.522 --> 1:18:17.389
No.

1:18:20.292 --> 1:18:21.894
I'm sorry, Junior!

1:19:23.055 --> 1:19:23.922
Evan.

1:19:25.924 --> 1:19:27.293
No matter what people say,

1:19:29.194 --> 1:19:30.496
no matter what you hear,

1:19:32.998 --> 1:19:34.567
I will always be your father.

1:19:38.037 --> 1:19:39.438
I love you, Dad.

1:19:41.373 --> 1:19:42.508
I know, man.

1:19:46.312 --> 1:19:49.281
I want you to remember
something, okay?

1:19:54.253 --> 1:19:58.223
The only thing you have
in this world is family.

1:20:27.252 --> 1:20:30.456
Mr. McGee! Mr. McGee!

1:21:07.192 --> 1:21:09.361
We are you

1:21:09.395 --> 1:21:13.065
and everyday we walk
as ghosts amongst you.

1:21:14.366 --> 1:21:16.001
And a
reasonable majority.

1:21:16.034 --> 1:21:18.605
We are the
tick and the tock.

1:21:18.638 --> 1:21:20.573
We are you.

1:21:20.607 --> 1:21:23.108
It is here,
this is not the end.

1:21:23.142 --> 1:21:25.077
But the
end of the beginning.

1:21:25.110 --> 1:21:26.546
Join us.

1:21:26.579 --> 1:21:28.581
We are the
Voices of the Voiceless.

1:21:32.184 --> 1:21:34.353
Seven.

1:21:34.386 --> 1:21:35.921
Number two is 24.

1:21:38.991 --> 1:21:43.996
And the third number 1-5, 15.

1:21:45.397 --> 1:21:48.367
Here we go fourth
number drawn, two

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:51.336
and the fifth and
final number, 11.

1:21:54.039 --> 1:21:57.309
And here we are,
the record breaking

1:21:57.342 --> 1:21:59.211
last bonus number, 44.

1:22:02.749 --> 1:22:06.686
Congratulations, we
go at new billionaire.

1:22:16.696 --> 1:22:17.697
Evan, I won.

1:22:25.304 --> 1:22:26.171
I won.

1:22:28.307 --> 1:22:29.308
Evan, I won.

1:23:20.325 --> 1:23:23.730
You know what to do
that with that, right?

1:23:45.250 --> 1:23:47.452
Dad, where are you going?

1:24:19.484 --> 1:24:22.387
Mr. McGee, it's all over with.

1:24:22.421 --> 1:24:23.522
There's no poison attack,

1:24:23.556 --> 1:24:24.523
it's all a big lie.

1:24:25.592 --> 1:24:26.626
Mr. McGee.

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:29.696
No, no, no, no.

1:24:31.598 --> 1:24:33.600
No, no, God, please, no.

1:24:39.706 --> 1:24:42.207
I should have never
have left you.

1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:45.712
I'm sorry, I'm here, hey.

1:24:45.745 --> 1:24:46.613
Baby.

1:24:50.917 --> 1:24:52.284
No.

1:24:52.317 --> 1:24:53.185
No!

1:24:54.219 --> 1:24:55.287
What'd you fucking do!

1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:08.701
Don't go out there,

1:25:08.735 --> 1:25:10.335
we're still under martial law.

1:25:10.369 --> 1:25:13.505
There's police soldiers
everywhere, Mr. McGee.

1:25:15.507 --> 1:25:16.375
Mr. McGee.

1:25:19.812 --> 1:25:20.747
Daddy.

1:25:22.447 --> 1:25:23.482
Baby, you're alive.

1:25:24.516 --> 1:25:26.451
Mr. McGee, she's alive.

1:25:35.528 --> 1:25:36.395
Mr. McGee!

1:25:47.674 --> 1:25:49.609
Martial

Just like I dreamed.

1:26:58.343 --> 1:27:00.613
Hey, you,

Drop your weapon or

1:27:03.583 --> 1:27:05.250
Hands up, hands up.

One lucky winner

will win $1 billion
and counting.

1:28:10.817 --> 1:28:12.819
That's the count.

1:28:12.852 --> 1:28:16.122
It's Lotto fever
all over the south.

1:28:27.166 --> 1:28:28.835
Good morning, sir.

1:28:28.868 --> 1:28:30.703
Would you be interested

1:28:30.736 --> 1:28:32.138

1:28:32.171 --> 1:28:33.706
We have a special message

1:28:33.739 --> 1:28:34.807
we are sharing

Yeah, come on in.
