IS THEY ARRESTED HIM

36:06.965 --> 36:08.367
- YEAH, HOW LONG IS THAT?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.901
TILL TOMORROW?

36:13.805 --> 36:17.276
I GAVE YOU THE BEST MINUTES
OF MY LIFE, YOU--

36:20.479 --> 36:23.449
[dramatic music]

36:23.482 --> 36:28.454
*

36:34.426 --> 36:38.864
- SO YOU GOT THE NIGHT SHIFT,
HUH, SERGEANT?

36:38.897 --> 36:41.867
I DID THE SAME THING
AT THE DINER.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.969
MIDNIGHT TO 8:00.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.805
IN ADDITION TO 8:00 TO 4:00.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.840
16 HOURS STRAIGHT

36:48.874 --> 36:51.810
TO HELP PAY FOR
MY BROTHER'S MEDICAL BILLS.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.011
BUT YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW,

36:53.044 --> 36:55.714
WHEN SOMEONE
IN YOUR FAMILY'S SICK.

36:59.618 --> 37:03.989
IS THERE ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY
WHO NEEDS ATTENTION?

37:04.022 --> 37:05.591
- MY SISTER'S A DIABETIC.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.858
[clears throat]

37:06.892 --> 37:09.361
SHE GOT IT
WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TEN.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.629
- YEAH, SO HOW'S SHE DOING?

37:10.662 --> 37:13.599
- THEY CUT HER LEG OFF
A FEW YEARS AGO.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.668
NOW SHE'S LOSING HER SIGHT.

37:16.702 --> 37:20.572
- GOD BLESS HER.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.608
SO I IMAGINE YOU'D SWIM
THE ENGLISH CHANNEL

37:22.641 --> 37:24.843
TO BE THERE FOR HER, HUH?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.044
- ACTUALLY, WE DON'T SEE MUCH
OF EACH OTHER.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.846
WE NEVER GOT ALONG.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.981
NOW DO YOU MIND?
I'M TRYING TO WORK HERE.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.787
- IT'S A FEW PILLS.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.527
IT'S A FEW FUCKING PILLS.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.900
- IT'S OKAY.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.476
- HOW THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA GET $5,000?

38:00.679 --> 38:02.714
[cheering]

38:07.085 --> 38:10.021
- I BELIEVE WE HAVE A WINNER.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.391
EVERYBODY, DOWN ON YOUR KNEES,

38:12.424 --> 38:14.826
WHERE I KNOW
YOU ALL WANT TO BE,

38:14.860 --> 38:17.829
FOR THE NEW
KING OF BABYLON.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.366
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS...

38:20.399 --> 38:21.967
JUSTIN!

38:22.000 --> 38:24.936
[cheering]

38:24.970 --> 38:26.405

[triumphant music]

38:29.441 --> 38:30.976
*

38:31.009 --> 38:32.811
- ME?

38:32.844 --> 38:35.347
- YOU.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.583
KING JUSTIN.

38:37.616 --> 38:43.054
*

38:43.088 --> 38:44.856
all: JUSTIN! JUSTIN! JUSTIN!

38:44.890 --> 38:47.426
[chanting continues]

38:47.459 --> 38:49.561
[cheers and applause]

38:54.700 --> 38:57.135
- WHOEVER THAT ASSHOLE IS
WHO'S BEEN IGNORING YOU,

38:57.168 --> 39:01.540
HE WON'T BE TAKING YOU
FOR GRANTED ANYMORE.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.443
- THANK YOU.
THANKS.

39:04.476 --> 39:07.446
[cheers and applause]

39:22.060 --> 39:25.030
[club music]

39:25.063 --> 39:27.899
*

39:27.933 --> 39:29.000
DID YOU SEE ME?

39:29.034 --> 39:30.602
- YEAH, I SAW YOU.

39:30.636 --> 39:31.803
- WELL?

39:31.837 --> 39:34.706
- I THINK THAT CONTEST
WAS RIGGED.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.774
- YOU KNOW HIM?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.008
- YEAH.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.777
I TAUGHT HIM
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.145
- EXCEPT HOW TO DANCE.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.717
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.919
I'D ASK HIM, ONLY I'M SURE
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.621
- SHAWN.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.122
- YOU'RE HOT.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.190
I WAS WATCHING YOU.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.125
- YOU WERE?

39:54.159 --> 39:59.164
- YOU MADE ME WANT TO FUCK
ALL NIGHT.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.566
YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE?

40:00.599 --> 40:03.969
- YOU LEAD.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.171
- I THOUGHT WE HAD PLANS.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.673
- IF YOU COULDN'T DO BETTER.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.175
I TOLD YOU
I MIGHT HAVE PLANS TOO.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.210
- WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.012
- HE'S JUST MY STALKER.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.548
- I SUPPOSE WE COULD
HAVE A THREE-WAY,

40:16.582 --> 40:18.216
ONLY HE'S KINDA OLD.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.118
- [chuckles]

40:20.151 --> 40:22.554
WE'RE ALSO KINDA LEAVING.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.523
*

40:24.556 --> 40:27.225
WAS HE THROWING HIMSELF
ALL OVER YOU?

40:27.258 --> 40:32.163
*

40:32.197 --> 40:33.999
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT AREN'T YOU THE PERSON

40:34.032 --> 40:35.601
WHO SAID ABOUT AN HOUR AGO

40:35.634 --> 40:36.802
THAT THEY'D HAD ENOUGH
OF THIS PULSATING,

40:36.835 --> 40:38.537
GRINDING FLESH
AND WANTED TO GO HOME?

40:38.570 --> 40:40.606
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?
- THERE'S NO RUSH.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.207
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T APPROVE.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.675
YOU KNOW,
ALL THE MISPLACED EMPHASIS

40:43.709 --> 40:45.611
ON SMOOTH, MUSCULAR BODIES,

40:45.644 --> 40:47.813
THE OBSESSION WITH YOUTH,
AND THE SHALLOW VALUES.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.615
- WELL, MAYBE I WAS BEING
A LITTLE JUDGMENTAL.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.583
- TRY HYPOCRITICAL.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.952
- WHO'S BEING JUDGMENTAL NOW?
- JUST BE HONEST.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.121
DON'T PUT SOMEONE DOWN
FOR DOING SOMETHING

40:56.154 --> 40:59.090
YOU'VE ALWAYS WISHED YOU COULD
DO, BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.726
I'M GOING HOME.

41:00.759 --> 41:01.993
- MICHAEL.

41:07.733 --> 41:09.535
- THERE'S MICHAEL.
- SO?

41:09.568 --> 41:11.870
- WELL, SO...

41:11.903 --> 41:13.905
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL NIGHT.
DON'T YOU WANT TO--

41:13.939 --> 41:18.243
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I'D RATHER BE WITH YOU.

41:18.276 --> 41:23.048
- I KNOW, BUT...

41:23.081 --> 41:25.016
IS THERE SOME SORT OF...

41:25.050 --> 41:26.985
- WHAT?

41:27.018 --> 41:28.253
- PROBLEM
ON ACCOUNT OF ME?

41:28.286 --> 41:30.522
- OF COURSE NOT.
- BECAUSE IF THERE IS,

41:30.556 --> 41:33.124
I DON'T WANT TO COME
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

41:33.158 --> 41:36.528
- YOU'RE NOT.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.897
AND EVEN IF YOU WERE,
IT WOULDN'T MATTER.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.269
- LOOK.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.137
DON'T SAY THAT.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.207
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
TO HURT YOU.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.742
IF I EVER THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA COME

41:50.776 --> 41:53.912
BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS...

41:53.945 --> 41:56.782
- IF A FRIEND OF MINE
HAS A PROBLEM WITH YOU,

41:56.815 --> 42:00.151
ALL IT MEANS IS HE WAS NEVER
REALLY MY FRIEND TO BEGIN WITH.

42:21.106 --> 42:25.210
- * A BEAUTIFUL ROOM

42:25.243 --> 42:30.048
* A PERFECT WASTE

42:30.081 --> 42:34.786
* ALL DUST UP
AND BEAUTIFUL *

42:34.820 --> 42:39.725
* FOR A POISONOUS TASTE

42:39.758 --> 42:44.195
* EAT THIS LOVE THAT TAKES

42:44.229 --> 42:49.200
* AND NEVER GIVES

42:49.234 --> 42:53.805
* DRINK THIS HEART
THAT ACHES *

42:53.839 --> 42:57.909
* AND NEVER LIVES

42:57.943 --> 43:02.814
* WHAT A BEAUTIFUL RUIN

43:02.848 --> 43:05.316
* THAT WE COULD BE

43:05.350 --> 43:09.087
- [muttering]

43:09.120 --> 43:11.322
- MICHAEL!

43:11.356 --> 43:13.324
- MA, MELANIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

43:13.358 --> 43:15.226
- WHERE'S BRIAN?

43:15.260 --> 43:18.964
- I WAS HOPING
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP.

43:18.997 --> 43:21.299
- WELL, I WOULD, DEBBIE,
BUT I CAN'T REALLY OPEN A BANK

43:21.332 --> 43:23.268
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

43:23.301 --> 43:25.003
- MAYBE CREDIT CARDS?

43:25.036 --> 43:28.139
- NO, THE MAXIMUM WITHDRAWAL
AT AN ATM IS $500.

43:28.173 --> 43:30.241
- I CAN COVER IT.
CAN THEY TAKE A CHECK?

43:30.275 --> 43:32.043
- ONLY IF IT'S CERTIFIED.

43:32.077 --> 43:33.779
- SHIT!

43:33.812 --> 43:35.814
COULD THEY MAKE IT
ANY MORE FUCKING DIFFICULT?

43:35.847 --> 43:36.948
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

43:36.982 --> 43:38.249
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL
A BAIL BONDSMAN.

43:38.283 --> 43:46.257
*

43:52.363 --> 43:55.266
- IF YOU CALL THIS NUMBER,

43:55.300 --> 43:57.002
MENTION THIS GUY'S NAME,

43:57.035 --> 43:58.269
HE'LL PUT UP THE BAIL
FOR YOU.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.006
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

44:01.039 --> 44:05.410
- I ASKED DINO
FOR A FAVOR.

44:05.443 --> 44:06.845
- THANK YOU.

44:06.878 --> 44:07.979
OH...

44:08.013 --> 44:09.715
THANK YOU, UM...

44:09.748 --> 44:10.816
- BLAKE.

44:10.849 --> 44:14.419
- BLAKE.
AH, THANK YOU, I'M DEBBIE.

44:14.452 --> 44:18.289
OH! OH, OH, THANK YOU!

44:18.323 --> 44:20.425
THAT'S SOME FRIEND
YOU'VE GOT.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.693
- YEAH, I LIKE TO THINK SO.

44:21.727 --> 44:23.261
- OH, THANK YOU!

44:23.294 --> 44:24.896
WHERE'D YOU FIND HIM?

44:24.930 --> 44:26.431
- IT'S A LONG STORY, DEB.

44:26.464 --> 44:28.033
- THANKS.

44:28.066 --> 44:29.267
- NO PROBLEM.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.069
- LOOK...

44:31.102 --> 44:33.438
I'M SORRY IF I'VE BEEN...

44:33.471 --> 44:35.807
SHITTY.

44:35.841 --> 44:40.178
- IT'S BECAUSE
YOU CARE ABOUT TED.

44:40.211 --> 44:42.047
SO DO I.

44:47.318 --> 44:48.820
- DID I MISS SOMETHING?

44:48.854 --> 44:49.921
- NO.
- WHAT?

44:49.955 --> 44:51.456
- NO. NOTHING.
- NOTHING.

44:51.489 --> 44:55.060
- OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET.
LET'S GO.

44:55.093 --> 44:56.795
- THANKS AGAIN!

44:56.828 --> 44:59.831
- I DIDN'T DO IT, OKAY?
I DIDN'T DO IT.

45:03.835 --> 45:06.171
- JESUS CHRIST, SIS,
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

45:06.204 --> 45:08.273
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF, UNCLE VIC.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.776
WE KNOW YOU'RE INNOCENT.

45:10.809 --> 45:12.744
- I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
CAN WE PLEASE GO HOME?

45:12.778 --> 45:14.379
- YES, I'LL TAKE YOU HOME
RIGHT NOW.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.447
BUT FIRST I WANT YOU
TO TAKE YOUR MEDS.

45:16.481 --> 45:18.449
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET
YOUR MEDS TO YOU ALL NIGHT.

45:18.483 --> 45:22.754
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, THE DESK
SERGEANT GAVE ME MY PILLS.

45:32.497 --> 45:33.932
- LET'S GO.

45:33.965 --> 45:35.934
- I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SO JEALOUS.

45:35.967 --> 45:37.435
- I AM NOT JEALOUS.

45:37.468 --> 45:38.436
- OH, NOW WHO'S
BEING DISHONEST?

45:38.469 --> 45:40.238
- WELL, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF YOUR BOYFRIEND

45:40.271 --> 45:43.008
WAS BEING OGLED
BY EVERY FAG IN TOWN?

45:43.041 --> 45:45.310
- IT SO HAPPENS, HE IS.

45:45.343 --> 45:46.978
- OH, I AM, YEAH.

45:47.012 --> 45:49.314
- CONSTANTLY.
ONLY YOU NEVER NOTICE.

45:49.347 --> 45:52.250
- YEAH. OH, YEAH. THAT'S
MY PROBLEM, FAULTY GAYDAR.

45:52.283 --> 45:54.119
- LUCKY FOR ME.

45:54.152 --> 45:57.055
- SO NOW THAT YOU'VE PROVEN TO
EVERYONE HOW HOT YOU ARE,

45:57.088 --> 45:58.990
EVEN AT YOUR AGE,
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GONNA

45:59.024 --> 46:00.859
BE OUT PARTYING EVERY NIGHT.

46:00.892 --> 46:03.328
- NOT EVERY NIGHT.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.963
[chuckles]

46:04.996 --> 46:06.531
BUT IT WAS NICE
TO GET THE ATTENTION,

46:06.564 --> 46:08.366
TO KNOW
I'M STILL ATTRACTIVE.

46:08.399 --> 46:10.902
I MUST ADMIT,
HOT YOUNG MEN

46:10.936 --> 46:15.273
WITH SMOOTH, MUSCULAR BODIES
HAS A CERTAIN APPEAL.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.542
BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS.

46:17.575 --> 46:20.846
WORK, MY SON...

46:20.879 --> 46:25.216
AND YOU.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.518
- SAY, BEFORE
YOU HANG THESE JEANS UP

46:27.552 --> 46:29.187
UNTIL NEXT LAUNDRY DAY,

46:29.220 --> 46:31.556
HOW ABOUT DOING
A LITTLE DANCE FOR ME?

46:31.589 --> 46:34.025
*

46:34.059 --> 46:35.526
- * I'M SO HOT

46:35.560 --> 46:39.564

* OOH, OOH-OOH-OOH

46:49.374 --> 46:53.611

46:53.644 --> 46:56.381
- KRCQ WEATHER,
IT'S HEATING UP.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.083
- YEAH.

46:58.116 --> 47:02.487
- * JUST A LITTLE
BIT CLOSER *

47:06.958 --> 47:10.395
- THIS COFFEE'S FOR SHIT.

47:10.428 --> 47:13.098
- SO JUSTIN'S
THE NEW KING OF BABYLON.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.466
- SO THE, UH, CUB CAUGHT
THE LION'S PREY, HM.

47:15.500 --> 47:19.204
- SO EVEN THOUGH YOU'D LIKE
TO REST ON YOUR LAURELS,

47:19.237 --> 47:20.471
SECURE IN
YOUR POSITION OF POWER,

47:20.505 --> 47:22.941
NOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE SNAPPING
AT YOUR HEELS.

47:22.974 --> 47:25.376
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO RUN FASTER AND FASTER...

47:25.410 --> 47:29.080
- SO WHY DON'T YOU PASS
THE FUCKING SUGAR?

47:29.114 --> 47:30.215
- YOU SHOULD BE
PROUD OF HIM.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.050
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.152
- [scoffs]

47:34.185 --> 47:36.621
- HEY, ISN'T THAT BRENT?

47:36.654 --> 47:38.323
- WHO'S BRENT?

47:38.356 --> 47:42.460
- EMMETT'S OLD FLAME.

47:42.493 --> 47:45.063
- MUST BE HIS NEW LOVE.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.569
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

47:58.476 --> 48:01.012
- BEEN A LONG TIME.

48:01.046 --> 48:03.381
- I'VE THOUGHT OF YOU...

48:03.414 --> 48:05.116
OFTEN.
