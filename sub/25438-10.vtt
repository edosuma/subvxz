and find an appropriate solution.

Oh, good, maybe he came to apologize
for being a spineless dickhead.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.582
He's probably just here to make sure
we don't run off with his equipment.

Hey, Phil, can you frame up on Bash,

19:30.377 --> 19:33.005
so I can see
what the aisle looks like from here?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.549

23:23.151 --> 23:25.070
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.865
All right, without further ado...

23:29.282 --> 23:33.995
-Britannica, do you take this man--
-Yes, I do. Yeah. [sighs]

23:34.079 --> 23:35.414
[audience cheers]

23:35.497 --> 23:38.875
-[priest] Uh, Toby, do you take--
-Wait! I object. Sorry, uh...

23:38.959 --> 23:40.502
[audience groans]

23:44.381 --> 23:47.217
[stammering] I'm sorry. I object.
I object.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.344
-I need to talk to you.
-No--

23:49.428 --> 23:51.471
-It's okay.
-[Rhonda] What are you doing?

23:52.347 --> 23:53.515
What's happening?

23:53.598 --> 23:55.600
Don't marry a stranger, okay?

23:55.684 --> 23:57.060
I need a green card, Bash.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.438
So marry me.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.231
[chuckles]

24:01.314 --> 24:02.816
Phil, tighten up on this.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.737
Is this for the show?

24:08.280 --> 24:11.825
No. Look, you know who I am, right?
And I can make you happy.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.703
[stammers] I-- Sorry.
I <i>want </i>to make you happy.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.121
Why are you doing this, Bash?

24:16.204 --> 24:18.623
I've been coming to your room,
sleeping on your floor,

24:18.707 --> 24:21.376
and I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you I love you.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.713
Look, I-- I have trouble processing
my emotions sometimes.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.715
Ideally, I would have told you this
weeks ago,

24:26.798 --> 24:29.050
and we'd go on a date
and figure it out, but...

24:29.342 --> 24:32.137
you-- you know, maybe we do everything
backwards. [chuckles]

24:35.432 --> 24:37.309
[priest] Uh, should I continue
with the ceremony?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.603
Yeah. She's marrying <i>me.</i>

24:44.524 --> 24:45.484
No, I'm not. [sighs]

24:45.567 --> 24:47.611
[audience gasps]

24:48.904 --> 24:52.532
Toby, you're a beautiful man
and a devoted fan,

24:53.700 --> 24:54.743
but I'm gonna marry Bash.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.955
The announcer? Britannica, I love you.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.833
And I'm always gonna be fond of you
and your baked goods.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.628
[quietly] And you will be compensated
for your time here today.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.922
-Fuck you, man. Yeah.
-[audience gasps]

25:07.005 --> 25:08.131
Fuck all of you!

25:08.215 --> 25:09.758
-[Sam] Whoa!
-[laughs] Whoa.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.134
Love is fake...

25:11.218 --> 25:13.094
-Just like wrestling!
-Hey!

25:13.512 --> 25:14.429
Fuck off!

25:14.513 --> 25:17.098
-[shouting]

25:17.182 --> 25:19.684
-[shouting]
-[upbeat music playing]

25:23.897 --> 25:24.731
Throw him out.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.650
Britannica, I love you!

25:26.733 --> 25:29.194
-[Tammé shouts]
-[Toby] I'll go! I'll go! I'll go!

25:29.569 --> 25:30.570
[Keith] Hey!

25:32.030 --> 25:34.074
-Get outta here!
-Get outta here!

25:34.824 --> 25:36.159
[Bash clears throat] Uh...

25:40.664 --> 25:42.290
-Really? You want me to keep going?
-Yeah.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.750
Oh. Uh...

25:45.126 --> 25:46.878
Britannica, do you take...

25:48.171 --> 25:49.339
Sebastian Howard.

25:49.422 --> 25:50.882
...Sebastian Howard
to be your lawful wedded husband?

25:52.676 --> 25:54.302
I do. [chuckles]

25:54.511 --> 25:57.514
And, Sebastian, do you take Britannica
to be your lawful wedded wife?

25:57.931 --> 25:58.765
I do.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.185
By the power invested in me
by the state of California,

26:02.644 --> 26:04.396
I now pronounce you man and wife.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.523
-You may kiss the bride.
-[Rhonda laughs]

26:06.606 --> 26:09.609
[audience cheering]

26:12.821 --> 26:14.531
What the fuck is he doing?

26:14.614 --> 26:17.826
I don't know, but Rhonda just married
a millionaire without a prenup.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.911
[organ playing]

26:21.246 --> 26:22.247
Ready?

26:22.330 --> 26:24.416
One... two...

26:24.874 --> 26:25.792
[upbeat music playing]

26:31.965 --> 26:33.341
[audience cheers]

26:33.466 --> 26:34.301
Yes!

26:34.843 --> 26:37.846
Oh, wait. I don't believe in marriage.
[laughs] Fuck this.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.390
Hmm? [squeals]

26:40.473 --> 26:43.852
I almost forgot. Tonight's rules:

26:43.935 --> 26:47.355
Whoever wins the bouquet, wins the crown.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.523
[women] What?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.025
[shouting]

26:52.861 --> 26:54.404
[Bash] It's a battle royale!

26:54.487 --> 26:58.199
Holy Toledo!
We got fights in every corner!

26:58.283 --> 27:00.744
Now it's insane. This is great.

27:00.827 --> 27:01.828
It looks great.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.376
[groans]

27:11.713 --> 27:14.007
Russell, come around
so we can see Tammé from the front.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.553
[Bash] No! Viking is gone!

27:18.637 --> 27:21.014
Norse goddess, my butt!

27:25.935 --> 27:28.313
These bridesmaids got strategy.

27:28.396 --> 27:29.564
[Tammé groans]

27:30.231 --> 27:32.734
[Bash] Welfare Queen's back on welfare.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.612
-[hisses]
-[yelps]

27:37.322 --> 27:39.699
[Bash] Oh, there goes the bride!

27:39.991 --> 27:40.992
<i>My </i>bride!

27:42.285 --> 27:44.829
-[Cherry grunts]
-[Bash] Oh! Black Magic, is she in?

27:44.913 --> 27:45.997
Is she out?

27:46.498 --> 27:47.582
Whoa!

27:48.124 --> 27:52.921
Liberty Belle trying everything,
but can't seem to eliminate Melrose.

27:53.004 --> 27:57.133
And now, Black Magic is doing a spell.
Oh, she poked her eye out!

27:57.217 --> 28:00.011
And you can't give the evil eye
with no eye.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.932
And she's out!
That spell just turned into a curse.

28:06.559 --> 28:09.604
Ozone just exercised the nuclear option!

28:09.688 --> 28:11.690
Is this a betrayal?

28:12.565 --> 28:17.112
Better yet, Nuke just dragged Ozone out
of the Ozone Layer!

28:17.195 --> 28:18.029
I love it.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.281
Chaos, it's good.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.701
-[screams]
-[Bash] Liberty Belle's dangling,

28:22.784 --> 28:26.955
just like the fate of our country in 1776.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.711
Now I got her!

28:32.794 --> 28:34.087
[screaming]

28:36.673 --> 28:38.800
-[Melrose grunts]
-[Sheila growls, howls]

28:38.883 --> 28:40.552
[Keith] Melrose is out!

28:55.734 --> 28:56.985
Infidel!

28:57.569 --> 28:59.070
[Bash] Ooh, Junkchain!

28:59.154 --> 29:02.866
More like Junk Sprained Ankle
from the look of that fall.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.118
Beirut just self-destructed.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.828
[Keith] Beirut is out!

29:06.953 --> 29:08.079
[Debbie] I won!

29:08.163 --> 29:10.248
[Jenny shouts]

29:10.832 --> 29:13.585
[Bash] Fortune Cookie looks
like she just had her fortune read,

29:13.668 --> 29:17.005
and it says, "No crown for you, miss."

29:17.213 --> 29:18.840
[Keith] Fortune Cookie, out!

29:21.217 --> 29:23.970
[Bash] And it looks like
there's only three ladies left.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.680
We got a wild animal,

29:25.764 --> 29:27.515
-Ladies...
-[Bash] a Peruvian mountain,

29:27.599 --> 29:29.517
-[Kurt] Excuse us.
-and a Belle from Philly.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.437
-[Kurt] All right, that's enough.
-[Chico] Real wrestlers coming through!

29:32.520 --> 29:34.689
-Excuse us, ladies.
-Real wrestlers, excuse us.

29:35.523 --> 29:36.733
Hey!

29:37.108 --> 29:39.068
You call this a battle royale?

29:40.195 --> 29:43.031
-Looks more like a pillow fight.
-[laughs] It is a pillow fight!

29:43.114 --> 29:45.158
-[Chico and Kurt laugh]
-[booing]

29:46.367 --> 29:47.702
What are these guys doing?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.289
Look, it's Big Kurt Jackson
and Chico Guapo.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.999
Big time wrestlers.

29:53.082 --> 29:56.294
You boys wanna insult us?
Better say it to our faces.

29:56.377 --> 29:57.879
-Uh...
-Um... Are they serious?

29:58.004 --> 29:59.297
[Chico mutters]

29:59.380 --> 30:02.342
-Okay.
-Take that, chump. [laughs]

30:02.425 --> 30:04.511
Well, this match has just gotten serious.

30:05.053 --> 30:09.140
Will a man win the GLOW crown?
That's unheard of!

30:09.224 --> 30:12.060
Ladies, what do you say
we have a temporary truce

30:12.143 --> 30:13.853
while we deal with these men?

30:14.437 --> 30:17.023
Hey, Bash,
why don't you hold on to this for me?

30:17.982 --> 30:18.900
If I must!

30:25.532 --> 30:28.201
-[booing]
-[shouting]

30:30.995 --> 30:32.205
[snarls]

30:37.418 --> 30:40.797
Remember, only wrestling moves.
No punches.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.049
Don't want anyone to think we're okay
with hitting girls.

30:43.132 --> 30:43.967
[Carmen] Sure.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.094
[men grunting]

30:47.595 --> 30:50.265
-[Kurt] I just said no punches!
-Oh, really? [grunts]

30:51.891 --> 30:53.142
Yes!

31:03.152 --> 31:04.737

31:04.863 --> 31:07.156
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.242
Someone just got a body slam!

31:09.325 --> 31:11.327
[Kurt groaning]

31:14.038 --> 31:16.583
We even? Get enough screen time yet?

31:16.666 --> 31:19.711
You're still in the doghouse...
[grunts]

31:20.295 --> 31:21.796
-...but this is pretty good.
-Machu!

31:23.423 --> 31:24.382
I'm proud of you.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.717
[Carmen] Thanks.

31:25.800 --> 31:29.721
[Kurt] Wait, no, no, no! [grunts]

31:30.221 --> 31:31.931
[Keith] You! Out!

31:32.015 --> 31:33.308
See ya later!

31:38.938 --> 31:41.900
[laughing]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now take it easy.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.444
Ladies, I got this one.

31:44.777 --> 31:48.531
Step aside,
Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs,

31:48.615 --> 31:50.867
we got a new Battle of the Sexes

31:50.950 --> 31:53.244
here at the GLOW finale!

31:58.791 --> 32:00.960
Duck, clothesline. [grunts]

32:04.797 --> 32:06.674
Nice try. Come here!

32:07.175 --> 32:08.092
[groans]

32:08.176 --> 32:09.010
Hip toss me.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.432
[Bash] Oh! Looks like a hip toss!

32:14.515 --> 32:16.601
[shouts]

32:16.726 --> 32:18.853
I've been baking pies at home.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.105
[yells] Pies of rage!

32:22.106 --> 32:23.358

32:24.567 --> 32:26.569
Come on, Liberty Belle.
Come on, Liberty Belle.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.655

32:29.530 --> 32:30.365
[Chico] On your feet.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.004
Oh!

32:45.088 --> 32:48.132
[audience chanting] USA! USA!

32:48.216 --> 32:52.804
I have faith that US and Mexican relations
can only improve in the future.

33:00.979 --> 33:01.854
[shouts]

33:05.316 --> 33:06.192
[Sam] Holy shit!

33:07.318 --> 33:10.196
-[Bash] I can't believe what I'm seeing!
-[shouts]

33:10.279 --> 33:13.741
Liberty Belle just did a castator
into a crossbody!

33:14.283 --> 33:17.120
That's like doing algebra in space!

33:24.877 --> 33:26.170
Ready to lose to a girl?

33:26.587 --> 33:27.922
Just get my face on camera.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.466
What do you wanna do?
Think you can do a backflip?

33:30.550 --> 33:31.759
Sure, yeah, I can.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.886
[screams]

33:41.978 --> 33:43.980
That guy just did a backflip!

33:48.109 --> 33:49.652
[Chico shouts]

33:51.529 --> 33:54.365
[Bash] And he's gone! He's gone!

33:54.449 --> 33:57.035
The ladies are still in this match!

33:57.535 --> 33:58.661
If there's one thing I know,

33:58.745 --> 34:02.498
it's that no <i>cojones</i> are going home
with this co-rown-e.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.584
[all exclaim]

34:08.880 --> 34:10.423
[women yelling]

34:10.506 --> 34:11.883
[Debbie] Give it to me!

34:13.134 --> 34:16.512
Phil, I want a close-up of Carmen's face
when she wins the crown.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.264
[Sam] Oh, she's not getting it.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.059
-[Ruth] Debbie's keeping it?
-Take your headphones off.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.394
What?

34:23.478 --> 34:26.147
You're warmed up, right? Come on.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.067
Let's go. Let's go. Come on, Hopalong.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.444
Let's go! Let's go!

34:32.320 --> 34:33.946
All right, don't do anything fancy.

34:34.030 --> 34:37.700
Just-- Just catapult in
with your foot out. That's it.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.119
They all know you're coming, and then...

34:40.745 --> 34:41.871
the crown is yours.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.291
[both laugh]

34:45.917 --> 34:47.335
Come on, let's go.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.253
We're waiting. Everyone's waiting.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.720
[Ruth screaming]

34:58.012 --> 35:00.014
What the hell is that?

35:00.890 --> 35:03.810
Oh, my God!
Is that a Russian on a zip line?

35:03.893 --> 35:04.811
It is!

35:04.894 --> 35:06.896
[continues screaming]

[Bash] Oh, my goodness gracious!

35:12.860 --> 35:13.778
Yeah!

35:14.737 --> 35:17.073
[Bash] And the ladies are down!

35:17.156 --> 35:20.326
Zoya's this year's winner of the crown!

35:29.794 --> 35:30.753
[Keith] Winner!

35:33.297 --> 35:37.635
Ah! You love to hate Zoya!

-Hey. [sighs] Hey.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.653
[Rhonda] Um...

35:56.028 --> 35:58.281
You can still back out of this
if you want.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.909
I-- I meant everything I said out there.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.997
I'm-- I'm not sure I feel that way.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.500
Yet.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.712
Okay. Um...

36:13.504 --> 36:14.422
That's okay.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.466
We'll just, you know,
take it one day at a time, right?

36:18.050 --> 36:20.178
Beginning tomorrow, we'll wake up

36:20.261 --> 36:22.555
and we'll head on down
to the county clerk's office,

36:22.638 --> 36:24.140
get the marriage license taken care of,

36:24.223 --> 36:26.851
and then after breakfast,
we'll go get you a real ring,

36:26.934 --> 36:28.936
and not these cheesy fake ones. [chuckles]

36:30.021 --> 36:31.022
[chuckles]

36:31.522 --> 36:33.107
You wanna get me a ring?

36:34.025 --> 36:37.111
Yeah, of course.
I mean, you know, I want to do everything.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.071
-[clears throat]
-[chuckles softly]

36:39.155 --> 36:42.867
[Bash] Um... okay, I gotta go talk
to those executives, but, uh...

36:42.950 --> 36:44.994
-Okay.
-Okay. Uh...

36:46.162 --> 36:47.538
[Rhonda chuckles]

36:53.628 --> 36:55.421
Tall guy's interested. Look at him.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.256
I can't see him.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.926
Short bald guy's definitely bidding.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.929
I made lots of focused eye contact
with him during the show.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.348
[Sheila] Why is Glen up there?

37:05.723 --> 37:09.060
K-DTV wants the show back
now that there's outside interest?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.145
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Sam sighs]

37:15.942 --> 37:17.944
[women giggling]

37:23.866 --> 37:25.201
Where are they going?

37:38.047 --> 37:39.715
You gonna tell 'em, or you want me to?

37:40.633 --> 37:41.634
[clears throat]

37:42.134 --> 37:42.969
[Glen] Uh...

37:43.052 --> 37:48.516
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, ladies,
but K-DTV owns your characters,

37:48.599 --> 37:51.978
which means you can't sell them
to another network.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.943
You know, you signed a contract.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.822
But listen, by all means...

38:03.739 --> 38:08.077
keep doing the live show,
you know, for your fans...

38:08.911 --> 38:12.331
and the gym, to feed the soul.

38:12.623 --> 38:13.541
[Bash] Glen...

38:15.209 --> 38:16.585
Get the fuck out of my gym.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.546
Okay.

38:22.842 --> 38:23.843
[door opens]

38:26.721 --> 38:27.888
[door closes]

38:28.180 --> 38:29.932
[Ray] Well, that show was insane.

38:30.975 --> 38:31.892
Good insane.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.104
Highbrow, lowbrow, comedy, drama,

38:35.396 --> 38:38.024
heartache, violence,
at a fucking wedding?

38:38.482 --> 38:40.735
I mean,
this show has something for everyone.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.529
And the costumes... Holy shit.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.906
I mean, you really got something here.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.576
Bra-fucking-vo.

38:49.618 --> 38:52.580
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ray.
Thanks for the review.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.750
Look,
this isn't what we hoped would happen,

38:55.833 --> 38:58.586
but this is what happened. We got fucked.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.131
All right? I'm sorry.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.052
Sometimes, stories end this way.

39:08.971 --> 39:09.930
[sighs]

39:15.728 --> 39:17.855
You guys interested in doing a floor show?

39:18.397 --> 39:19.648
Where? At the titty bar?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.777
[laughs] No, man. Vegas.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.822
I have stake in a club there,
and we're looking for a headliner.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.952
Now, Wayne Newton is at the Aladdin,
the New Frontier has Siegfried and Roy,

39:32.203 --> 39:34.246
and <i>Splash</i> just opened at the Riviera.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.999
Are-- Are you asking us to be showgirls?

39:37.083 --> 39:38.167
No.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.462
What I'm asking you to do
is the same exact show,

39:41.545 --> 39:44.256
night after night, 300 miles east.

39:46.133 --> 39:47.802
Vegas is where the money is.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.930
Headliners make at least 25 grand a week.

39:51.013 --> 39:51.847
[Sam] Ooh.

39:51.931 --> 39:56.769
You think this is a big room?
We have to fill 1,100 seats.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.896
I'm sorry. Who is that?
Who the fuck are you?

39:59.897 --> 40:02.858
That's Ray.
His kid goes to school with Justine.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.861
-He owns strip clubs.
-He's cool. I worked for him.

40:05.945 --> 40:06.821
Okay.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.825
Now...

40:11.242 --> 40:13.452
[chuckles] I don't know dick about TV.

40:14.036 --> 40:17.581
But I know that the screen is very small.

40:18.707 --> 40:23.587
But you gals throw one hell
of a big old live show.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.675
And there's nothing bigger
than a live show...

40:28.759 --> 40:29.927
in Vegas.

40:39.019 --> 40:41.021
[motor running]

40:42.565 --> 40:43.691
[Jenny] Oh, my God!

40:47.945 --> 40:50.156
Okay. Um... Oh, my God, I can't do it.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.907
It's a 40-minute plane ride.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.076
If you get the sudden impulse
to give him a bath, you can come home.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.037
Yeah. He's just so little.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.831
[Mark sighs] It's basically joint custody.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.250
It's just a little sooner
than we had planned.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.544
And if you don't wanna go, don't go.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.837
[crying] No, I'm going.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.132
But maybe this is one
of the benefits of divorce.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.261
-Okay, here I go.
-[crying]

41:13.596 --> 41:15.389
Okay, I love you. Oh, my God.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.058
I'll see you Thursday, okay? Oh, God.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.852
-[Randy fussing]
-[Debbie] Oh, fuck.

41:20.227 --> 41:22.646
[sobs] Oh, shit. Okay.

41:22.730 --> 41:23.856
I love you.

41:24.857 --> 41:28.194
Okay. Um, I'm gonna call a lot. [chuckles]

41:28.611 --> 41:31.071
Even if he's just gonna chew
on the phone cord.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.534
Okay.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.953
-Um, okay. Thank you.
-[Randy crying]

41:40.664 --> 41:41.624
All right, bye.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.674
I liked it better
when you were on crutches.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.636
-You couldn't run away to Vegas.
-[Ruth] No. [laughs]

42:03.103 --> 42:04.063
Are you okay?

42:05.022 --> 42:05.856
Yeah.

42:06.899 --> 42:10.152
How about you come with us?
[chuckles softly]

42:10.819 --> 42:14.031
Here's something you don't need
for a live floor show in Vegas:

42:14.114 --> 42:14.949
a cameraman.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.076
It'll be fine.

42:17.451 --> 42:20.955
K-DTV is gonna have me shoot
some <i>Good as Gold</i> episodes.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.249
We'll write some mushy letters
to each other.

42:23.832 --> 42:25.376
You'll visit, I'll visit.

42:26.252 --> 42:27.753
We'll try not to fuck it up.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.801
