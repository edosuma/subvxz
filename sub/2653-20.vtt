WEBVTT

00:02.469 --> 00:04.575
- Are you getting this?
- I'm getting the shot.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.379
I'm just not getting
what you're trying to do.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.216
We're in Australia.
It's on the bottom of the globe.

00:09.276 --> 00:12.120
So everyone here but me is upside-down.
It's geography.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.353
It's a good time to tell you.
I dropped Luke on his head when he was one.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.657
- Huh.
- Okay, I'm up.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.493
Did you drop him too?

00:19.553 --> 00:22.227
- Grab my leg, buddy. Here we go.
- Oh.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.236
- I come from the land down under.
- He doesn't.

00:25.292 --> 00:28.102
I was conceived in Australia
on my parents' honeymoon.

00:28.162 --> 00:33.111
It was a romantic summer night-
their summer- on a blanket in the park.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.979
- I still have that blanket.
- Phil's mom left us money for a trip there.

00:37.038 --> 00:40.019
When the rest of the family found out,
they all just jumped on board.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.747
My mom's grandfather was Australian...

00:41.809 --> 00:44.915
and she'd spend her summers-
their winters- visiting him.

00:44.979 --> 00:48.517
It was a very special place for her.
She always wanted me to see it.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.562
You still have that blanket?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.461
Yeah, silly. it's the one on our bed.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.968
You sure you don't want
some of this Vegemite, Gloria?

00:56.023 --> 00:57.525
You don't know what you're missing.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.696
Ay. I don't eat anything
unless I know what's in it.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.866
I've seen this woman
scarf down a pig's nose.

01:02.930 --> 01:08.107
Sometimes one must travel halfway across
the globe to get the clearest view of home.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.274
- This was my whole flight.
- What's she talking about?

01:10.337 --> 01:13.341
My college application essay.
They want students who are worldly.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.718
Why don't you write about our trip to Hawaii,
when you drank straight from a coconut?

01:16.777 --> 01:19.485
I feel like Harvard's
gonna get a lot of those, so-

01:19.547 --> 01:21.754
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to say thanks...

01:21.816 --> 01:24.387
for being a part of this pilgrimage
to majestic Australia...

01:24.452 --> 01:25.954
which was once a penal colony.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.863
Grow up.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.061
- What?
- This place was really special to my mom.

01:30.124 --> 01:33.162
She actually left me a list of things
that she thought we should do-

01:33.227 --> 01:36.174
Visit the Great Barrier Reef,
see the bush-

01:36.230 --> 01:37.436
Really.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.637
And climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.981
What do you say, mates?

01:44.038 --> 01:46.609
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know how I am with heights.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.848
Ay. is that why
you never wear high heels?

01:49.910 --> 01:51.218
You guys are with me, right?

01:51.278 --> 01:52.916
- Absolutely not.
- Nah, I'm not doing that.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.687
- Really?
- No.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.853
"No worries." That's Australian.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.091
I'll do that one on my own if I have to.
I'm just so excited we're all here together.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.657
- Actually, we have to go.
- Yeah, so-

02:02.723 --> 02:04.396
Back in the day,
we knew this guy from Australia.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.960
- New Zealand.
- Same thing.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.596
- It's not.
- He didn't have a lot of friends...

02:07.661 --> 02:08.901
and we felt sorry for him.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.000
But the truth is,
he was kind of annoying.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.102
- He was one of those guys that was always on.
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.703
Big relief when his visa ran out.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.270
Anyway, through no fault of my own-

02:16.337 --> 02:17.873
No, wait. You announced on Facebook...

02:17.938 --> 02:20.179
that we were going to Australia,
which is where he lives.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.380
Fergus invited us to lunch.
I couldn't say no.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.945
I could've said no.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.355
- Which is why you have 12 friends on Facebook.
- Yeah.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.952
Claire, honey, I got to tell you.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.189
You really knocked it out of the park
on the Hanover deal.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.823
- Oh, come on, Dad. That was all you.
- No, it was you.

02:33.888 --> 02:36.767
- No, it was you!
- It was you. it was your baby.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.896
This was my whole flight.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.634
Claire took the lead on her first project...

02:42.696 --> 02:44.801
at the company and scored a big one.

02:44.865 --> 02:49.644
Best part is, she beat out
that arrogant gasbag Earl Norton...

02:49.703 --> 02:52.684
over at Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.620
I wish I could see the look
on his stupid face, face, face, face.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.381
So, what's first?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.654
I think Manny wants to see
the Opera House.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.286
Actually, it was a long flight.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.922
I was thinking maybe just...
hang out on Bondi Beach.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.898
That's a great idea, Manny.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.197
Bondi Beach is topless.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.568
Thank you, TripAdvisor.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.302
- Beach it is.
- Let's get this Aussie party started!

03:17.364 --> 03:18.866
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with your mouth?

03:18.933 --> 03:20.537
¡Ay.! Your lips are huge!

03:20.601 --> 03:22.672
I think you're allergic
to the Vehe-mi-te.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.444
- No worries.
- I'd be a little worried.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.618
♪ Hey, hey♪

03:29.677 --> 03:31.714
♪ Hey, hey♪

03:45.859 --> 03:48.499
My mom said that Joe is fine...

03:48.562 --> 03:49.870
that he ate, he slept...

03:49.930 --> 03:51.705
he woke up and then he ate again.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.006
Classic Joe.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.241
So, uh, Luke and I are gonna
take a break from the sun.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.805
Yeah. We're kind of tired.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.817
Tired of not seeing boobs.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.722
Watching the natives
take nourishment from their land...

04:04.778 --> 04:06.416
has made me acutely aware...

04:06.480 --> 04:08.585
of the fact that I am just
saying words now.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.889
What is wrong with me?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.190
I'm totally blocked.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.425
So am I. Scooch.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.694
Hi. How's it going?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.291
Hi.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.394
Why aren't you all over that?
He's totally gorgeous.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.602
This country's number-one export
is hot surfers.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.373
I'm not gonna buy the first one I see.
I'm still browsing.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.977
Ooh! Kangaroos! I'm going to buy one.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.381
Lily, what did I just say?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.976
I don't know.
Something about shoes, probably?

04:35.042 --> 04:37.283
Your dad gave you enough money
for one souvenir.

04:37.344 --> 04:40.689
Don't buy the first thing you see.
You'll regret it your whole trip.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.251
You're right. I have enough regret.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.660
You gotta be kidding me.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.723
- We got outbid!
- What? By whom?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.770
- I'll give you four guesses.
- Damn it.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.327
Wait a second.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.567
They're giving us 48 hours
to submit a new bid.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.199
We can do that. We can totally do that.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.403
Let's go back to the hotel
and figure it out.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.275
- Can it wait?
- Yeah. We're on vacation.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.973
Oh, sorry, guys. We have to do this.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.778
- This is my baby.
- Jay!

05:04.838 --> 05:06.181
- Dad!
- Claire!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.241
Gloria.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.254
Fine! You two go back to work.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.017
Phil and I,
we're going to walk to the ocean...

05:11.078 --> 05:13.718
- and we're going to have more fun without you.
- Yeah, we will.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.283
No, we won't. Not at all.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.124
Why would you guys even say that?

05:18.986 --> 05:22.661
So, after sitting there for 40 minutes,
I tell the waitress, "I'm actually in a hurry.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.795
Any chance of getting the eggs
before they turn into chickens?"

05:25.859 --> 05:27.736
- Hah.
- You know? And she's a total bogan.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.036
She's like,
"I've got five tables!"

05:30.097 --> 05:32.976
You know how they have the tray?
She's sashaying with the legs.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.071
"Oh, who's got the waffles?
Who-Who's got the waffles?"

05:36.136 --> 05:37.945
- All right. We get it.
- Yeah.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.417
- People are looking.
- Oh, nothing I can do to stop that.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.976
Well, I can think of one thing.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.022
Well, listen, Fergus.
It has been great catching up.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.615
- Yes. - But we really have to spend
some time with our family today.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.457
I'm- I'm so sorry.
Um, Mr. Anderson? We are huge fans.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.123
- Could we get a picture? Is that possible?
- Of course. Bring it in.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.928
Sit down there. There you go.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.331
I won't get up.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.926
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Google him.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.732
I didn't spring for an international data plan.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.397
- Thank you so much.
- You like that? All right.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.100
Oh, my God!

06:03.163 --> 06:05.109
Remember your old downstairs neighbor...

06:05.165 --> 06:07.167
that could put
his entire fist in his mouth?

06:07.234 --> 06:08.736
Cam.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.338
I think my fist got bigger.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.783
Wait. Fergus, you have your own show?

06:13.841 --> 06:14.876
Oh! Yeah.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.013
It's just a little talk show.
No big deal.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.079
It's a big deal here,
I suppose, but yeah.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.183
It's a shame you guys
have got to leave so soon.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.818
- Well-
- We could stay for a little bit longer.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.453
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's fine.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.158
- You never finished the story about the waitress and the-
- Oh, yeah.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.065
"Who had the waffles?"

06:30.124 --> 06:32.934
Waffles!

06:33.927 --> 06:35.429
I just feel bad that Claire and Jay...

06:35.496 --> 06:36.998
are missing such a beautiful day...

06:37.064 --> 06:39.601
in this gorgeous country,
which is also a continent.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.612
- You have a lot of facts.
- Uh-huh.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.673
I think this spiritual journey of yours
is a wonderful thing.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.980
I think it's gonna
make you feel closer to your mother.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.647
I hope so. I miss her.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.385
It's the biggest reason
I came here- to connect.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.949
- Is that weird?
- Not at all.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.621
I talk to my late grandmother
all the time.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.028
She would have loved this place.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.658
I wonder if she's here with me now.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.896
No, she doesn't like to fly.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.599
Isn't it wild that my mom and dad
made footprints in this very sa-

07:08.662 --> 07:09.766
- Aah!
- What?

07:09.830 --> 07:12.140
Aah! Something bit me!

07:12.199 --> 07:14.577
Jellyfish!

07:25.345 --> 07:27.723
What is this? Not one topless woman.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.227
Calm down.
You're gonna spook the boobs.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.423
Uh, wait. 2:00.

07:34.388 --> 07:35.389
Oh.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.774
Hey, Luke! Luke! How deep is it?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.243
Be cool!
We don't want to look like idiots!

07:50.671 --> 07:53.709
I lost my bathing suit!
Manny, help me find it!

07:53.774 --> 07:56.254
I don't have my nose plug!

07:56.310 --> 07:59.291
Little boy, are you okay?

07:59.346 --> 08:03.886
- Manny, say something!
- Miss! Miss! He lost his bathing suit!

08:03.951 --> 08:05.953
Oh, honey,
I can help you find it. it's okay.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.090
- I'm fine! Aah!
- The water's really clear.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.725
Uh-

08:10.958 --> 08:13.461
♪♪I love your limo!

08:13.527 --> 08:15.734
You don't think it draws
too much attention to me?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.639
What are you talking about?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.200
No.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.440
We ended up spending a little more time
with Fergus than we planned.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.779
- Which, honestly, felt like growth to us.
- Yes.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.945
Because I think sometimes
we judge people before we get to know them.

08:30.577 --> 08:34.115
I cannot believe they let us in here.
How famous are you?

08:34.181 --> 08:37.059
Well, sometimes,
I feel like I'm the one in the zoo.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.756
Only difference between me and this guy
is I won't pee on you.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.958
Eh?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.524
Seriously, they will pee on you.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.433
Oh, for real?
He will pee on us. Okay.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.233
Turns out we have a lot in common.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.036
For example,
we all hate standing in lines.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.078
- Make sure I get copies of those.
- isn't he funny?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.806
- We're with him. So we're just gonna-
- Through you go.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.849
Sorry. Classic Fergus,
getting us in like this.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.906
Come on.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.448
- Where's the next gift shop?
- I cannot look at another souvenir, Lily.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.426
- You did this.
- Lily, relax. You'll find the perfect one.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.053
I want to believe you...

09:11.118 --> 09:14.531
but that lifeguard
was the cutest boy I've ever seen.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.862
I know.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.028
Hey, guys!
Found 'em in the business center.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.162
Come on.
We got to catch the bus to the bush.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.467
What time did you wake up?

09:21.528 --> 09:24.202
5:00 a. m.
Claire has an incredible work ethic.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.175
- She's like a young me.
- Oh.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.703
Yung-mi was our accountant from Korea.
Died at her desk.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.272
Okay, enough work.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.840
- It's time to enjoy our vacation.
- Yeah.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.977
- We just got to finish up a few quick-
- No, you're done.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.385
- Done. We're done.
- Let's go.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.514
Jay, I miss you.

09:38.579 --> 09:42.152
And besides, I don't know that
I can keep Phil safe anymore.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.990
I think he's going to die here.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.427
- Oh, it's Fergus.
- What? Why did he text you and not me?

09:49.489 --> 09:52.163
- He invited us to a party today
on Hugh Jackman's yacht. - What?

09:52.225 --> 09:56.139
- Not today! No! I want to meet Hugh Jackman.
- I do too. I do too.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.834
But we can't bail on my family again.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.969
That makes us complete
star you-know-what-ers.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.876
Plus, Cam,
this will be fun too. Come on.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.178
Everybody have their sunscreen
and bug spray? I got the snakebite kit.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.311
Hey, guys,
we just got some really bad news.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.378
Yeah, so-

10:15.582 --> 10:21.089
Walking the paths once trod
by the first Australians has made me... what?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.360
Unbearable?

10:22.422 --> 10:23.765
Now, if we're lucky...

10:23.824 --> 10:26.430
we'll see some of Australia's
more famous indigenous species.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.564
Kangaroo, dingoes, koala.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.631
- Quick question.
- Oh, good. Another one.

10:30.697 --> 10:34.668
Isn't it true that baby kangaroos-
or joeys- are born without hind legs?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.409
Yes. Once again, you've correctly answered
your own question.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.814
- Yeah.
- I just got a text from Earl...

10:38.872 --> 10:40.909
- at Closets, Closets, Clos-
- I know what it's called.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.511
Listen to this.
"Better luck next time. Ha, ha."

10:43.577 --> 10:45.955
He always knows what to say to get my goat.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.755
I'm waiting for a quote from the lumber supplier,
but this hike is three hours.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.317
- I'm gonna lose signal.
- Let's go back.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.386
Dad, we can't just up and leave
without a plausible reason wh-

10:52.452 --> 10:54.693
Claire's hurt!

10:56.657 --> 10:58.864
- What happened?
- Well, you know what a klutz she is.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.666
- Honey, are you okay?
- Not really.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.400
Yeah, well, I-
Let me get her back to camp.

11:02.462 --> 11:06.569
- We're just gonna slow you down. Come on, sweetheart.
- Yeah, you guys have fun.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.840
How dumb do they think we are?

11:08.902 --> 11:11.940
Sometimes Claire leaves me pictures of food
instead of a shopping list.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.751
I'm so nervous. Are we gonna see
Hugh Jackman in a bathing suit?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.687
What do we say to Hugh Jackman
in a bathing suit?

11:18.745 --> 11:20.247
Oh, my God. it's so big.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.054
That's a bit direct,
but he might be flattered.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.458
Oh. You're talking about the boat.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.258
- Fergus!
- Fergus! Hey!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.992
Oh, guys.
Thank God you're here.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.558
- Just had the worst fight with Hugh.
- Oh, no. What happened?

11:30.624 --> 11:33.764
I took a shot at Russell Crowe in Les Mis.
Hugh took offense.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.829
- Oh, well, he has to know Russell was-
- He has to know.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.398
- Horribly miscast.
- It's not his fault.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.001
- It's not his fault.
- The acting was fine, but-

11:40.067 --> 11:42.069
Okay, let's get on this boat
and fix this. Come on.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.809
That's not the boat.
They've already gone.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.442
Hugh was standing on his deck
in a skimpy little bathing suit...

11:47.507 --> 11:49.009
disappointed look on his face.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.953
Wait. I'm s- Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.820
- Skimpy?
- I'm sorry. Standing on his what?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.985
- On his deck.
- Of the boat. Got it. Okay.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.620
You know what? We don't need them.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.256
I'll hire a boat.
We'll have our own party!

12:02.189 --> 12:03.691
This is the life, eh, boys?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.759
Oh, s- So we're not taking this
to a bigger boat?

12:05.826 --> 12:09.103
A bigger boat! Have a meat pie.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.608
- No, thank you. No.
- No, thank you.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.013
- Are you okay, Phil?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.015
I just wish Claire was here
to see all this.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.517
- Ah.
- Plus, my foot's twice its normal size...

12:20.574 --> 12:23.145
and the mosquitoes
are really going after my jellyfish bites.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.417
Look! A sign!

12:27.881 --> 12:29.383
What?

12:29.449 --> 12:32.225
You wanted to see a kangaroo,
and now you see one.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.390
I think this is your mother
trying to tell you...

12:34.454 --> 12:37.492
that the rest of the trip
is going to be magical, Phil.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.867
That is so my mom,
to say it with a kangaroo.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.805
Look. it's so beautiful.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.969
Okay, but be careful.
You're gonna scare him.

12:46.032 --> 12:49.241
G'day, mate. Hey.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.303
Yes.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.378
Hey, aren't you gor-

12:53.140 --> 12:54.175
¡Ay.!

13:01.782 --> 13:04.092
This one. No, this one.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.062
No, this one! I can't breathe!

13:06.119 --> 13:09.157
Shopping with Lily
is the best birth control in the world.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.860
Yeah.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.461
But you know it's not, right?

13:13.527 --> 13:15.029
Ooh! This one!

13:15.095 --> 13:17.575
Thank God. Hurry up and buy it.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.111
Wait. What if there's a better one later?

13:20.167 --> 13:22.579
- Let's keep looking.
- No, no, no! You are buying that.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.242
You're never gonna find anything better.
I never found a hotter lifeguard, okay?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.546
This is perfect,
and it is right in front of you. Here.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.587
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.452
Hey. I really love your accent.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.583
Wow. Thank you.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.690
I would like to return this.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.556
Penny for your thoughts?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.067
Boobs.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.104
Me too. What's our problem?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.866
I freaked out
when those things came at us.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.272
I think I could've handled one,
but they ganged up on me.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.972
Hey, boys. How would you like to participate
in an aboriginal walkabout?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.538
No, thanks. Why don't you ask
those girls over there?

13:57.604 --> 14:00.585
- This walkabout's for men only.
- Trust me. We're not men.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.314
Sound like you need this more than anyone.
Quick. Come here.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.457
Perfect. Now we're wearing makeup.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.759
Oh. You have got to be kidding me.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.457
Okay, can we walk to the bush?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.467
Nah. Dispatch is sending a cab in an hour.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.797
- An hour.
- What?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.360
No, Cam, we deserve this.

14:19.426 --> 14:23.499
We deserted our family, we abandoned
our daughter, and for what? Huh?

14:23.563 --> 14:26.339
We're not just star you-know-what-ers.
We're you-know-what-holes!

14:26.399 --> 14:28.436
You know Lily's not here, right?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.845
Oh, my God.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.590
- Please be cool.
- I'm always cool.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.416
Hello!

14:45.518 --> 14:47.020
There's some pretty fancy shoes.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.491
Thank you?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.467
So, listen, we don't want any trouble...

14:51.524 --> 14:54.266
uh, but my- my friend and I-

14:54.327 --> 14:56.432
- "Friend?" Really?
- Yeah.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.840
- We had a little cab problem.
- Our cab broke down.

14:58.899 --> 15:04.508
And we are trying to get to our daughter-
the daughter my friend and I have together.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.517
Well, that ain't right.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.778
Daddies should be
with their little girls.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.015
Seriously, where can I get
a pair of them shoes?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.889
- He wants your shoes. Give him your shoes.
- What? Okay.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.656
I don't want your shoes.
I wanna get me own.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.197
He doesn't want your shoes.
Put your shoes on.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.299
- I knew it!
- Gloria, don't be mad.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.963
- Too late!
- I know this looks really bad...

15:28.028 --> 15:30.008
but you have to understand
that this is my-

15:30.063 --> 15:31.906
Your baby? I know.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.808
And you should be ashamed of yourself!

15:33.867 --> 15:38.247
You have a husband who is on a spiritual
journey and was punched by a kangaroo!

15:38.305 --> 15:40.114
What?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.652
Gloria!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.147
Honey, I just heard.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.156
How did you get punched by a kangaroo?

15:46.212 --> 15:48.385
Really hard. In the face.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.086
Oh. I'm sorry.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.756
Oh, boy. ls there anything I can do?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.856
Could you stop working
and sit with me for a while?

15:54.921 --> 15:56.366
- Yes, of course I can.
- Thank you.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.731
Okay. Be- Be soft.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.533
- Ah, baby.
- Thank you.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.805
- Oh, my God. Phil.
- Ow. Oh!

16:03.863 --> 16:05.399
- Honey!
- Ow!

16:05.465 --> 16:08.935
Phil! A wild dog took my laptop!

16:09.002 --> 16:10.504
Seems like a missed opportunity.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.050
Honey, if you want to work, just say so.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.110
- No! it happened! it just happened!
- I didn't see anything.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.850
I didn't see you get hit in the face
by a kangaroo, but I believe you.

16:18.912 --> 16:22.359
- Come on! Help me get it!
- No! You're on your own!

16:22.415 --> 16:25.760
Like I've been this whole trip! Ow.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.257
For God's sakes!

16:28.321 --> 16:30.858
Gloria, stop! Let me explain!

16:30.924 --> 16:34.394
Fine. But the explanation better not be
that this is an important account...

16:34.461 --> 16:36.566
that you're on a deadline
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

16:36.629 --> 16:39.701
Oh. Well, I'm gonna need
a minute to think.

16:39.766 --> 16:44.511
I did not leave Joe, fly across the world
to see you spend all your time working.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.073
You're missing the whole vacation!

16:46.139 --> 16:48.244
Not the first wife to tell me that.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.721
So how many wives need to say it
before you listen?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.121
What's that?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.086
I'm not gonna tell you.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.723
If you were here,
you would know what that is.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.132
I don't know what that was.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.000
But I was not going to give him
the satisfaction.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.373
Ow! Damn it!

17:19.439 --> 17:22.282
Why, Australia? Why?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.816
- Hey, mate.
- How's... it going?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.825
- Everything okay here?
- Not really.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.418
You don't mind me saying,
you look a bit beaten up.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.053
Yeah.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.758
I love your country,
but your country doesn't love me back.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.461
Australia's rejected me.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.098
You see this right here?
That's from a croc bite.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.669
This one here on my back-

17:45.598 --> 17:48.044
I was hit by a tram in Melbourne.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.739
This right here-

17:49.803 --> 17:51.908
That's an irregular mole.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.281
- Should probably get that checked out.
- Uh-huh.

17:54.340 --> 17:58.015
Point is, Australia is nice to tourists...

17:58.078 --> 18:00.524
but it's tough on its own people.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.958
Congratulations, mate. You're one of us.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.360
- Are you saying what I think you're saying?
- I think I am.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.897
I'm Crocodile Dunphy?

18:06.953 --> 18:09.900
That's not what I was saying at all.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.937
Is that a kookaburra,
which are born blind, or-

18:15.829 --> 18:17.035
Mom?

18:21.968 --> 18:25.108
- There you are.
- Oh! Dad, the laptop is gone.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.845
We've got to get back to the hotel right now.
It's still fresh in my mind.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.386
I think I can just piece it together.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.580
- Claire.
- Yeah?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.247
- Let it go.
- What?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.451
No! I-I poured my heart into this.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.187
And don't you want to stick it to Earl?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.855
Doesn't matter. Go be with your family.

18:38.918 --> 18:42.263
Remember when you were a kid?
We'd take the family trips?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.893
- I'd disappear for days to work?
- Yeah.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.562
Don't be me.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.374
I feel like I'm letting you down.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.842
What are you talking about?

18:52.899 --> 18:55.436
I finally get to spend
a little vacation time with my daughter.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.776
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.911
What is that?

19:04.511 --> 19:07.617
- Lily! We're here!
- Daddies love you!

19:07.680 --> 19:09.216
Daddies!

19:09.282 --> 19:12.729
Oh, my gosh!

19:12.785 --> 19:14.731
Oh, this place is beautiful!

19:14.787 --> 19:17.563
That's our bus! Time to go!

19:17.624 --> 19:20.537
- What do you mean?
- Who are these guys?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.630
- Who's this guy?
- Oh.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.768
Honey, I am so sorry.
From now on, I am all yours.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.609
I promise. Whatever you want to do.

19:31.738 --> 19:35.276
- Phil, this is not what I had in mind.
- You're doing great, honey!

19:35.341 --> 19:37.048
What is a bridge?

19:37.110 --> 19:41.115
It's a connector, a supporter,
and sometimes it's a metaphor for-

Thank you for choosing to fly Qantas...

20:40.873 --> 20:45.288
on our nonstop fight
from Australia to Los Angeles.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.688
I feel a little guilty...

20:46.746 --> 20:48.248
sitting up here
without the family.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.816
- I don't.
- Me either.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.064
Don't you think it's a little rude
that they're sitting up there?

20:55.121 --> 20:56.794
I would never do that.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.860
Boy, you tense up fast after a vacation.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.633
I swear that's Hugh Jackman up there.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.731
- I saw him when we boarded.
- I don't think it's him.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.332
Oh, well, I'm gonna go find out.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.900
Cam, no. Cam, come on.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.175
Let him go, or none of us
will get any sleep.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.876
Hey, guys. Just saying hi.

21:17.543 --> 21:20.581
Excuse me.
I don't think he belongs up here.
