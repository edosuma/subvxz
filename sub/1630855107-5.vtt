[Coach] Not too shabby, T.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.958
Enjoy the meatloaf
they're serving tonight,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.210
'cause you earned it.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.379
How long do you expect me
to keep doing this?

01:29.339 --> 01:30.673
I get it.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.217
I know it ain't fun,

01:33.218 --> 01:34.969
but you're doing great work.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.554
[Jepp] I help the Last Men.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.265
They help me get my wife and kid back.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.475
That was the deal.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.559
Come on now, T!

01:42.560 --> 01:44.687
You know I've been pushing them
to find Louisa,

01:44.687 --> 01:46.940
but you're not
thinking through what's next.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.275
Your kid's a hybrid.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.445
They'll come after it sooner or later.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.280
I'd like to see 'em try.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.241
You could have a legacy here.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.660
Think I give a shit?

01:58.660 --> 02:03.081
You've been taking credit for
everything I've done since I joined up.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.751
Time for you to uphold
your end of the deal.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.923
All right. All right.
I'll make some calls.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.593
Last I heard, they had a promising lead.

I'm not afraid of you.

[Abbot] So it's true.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.303
Dr. Singh's little pet can talk.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.847
I am not a pet.

[Abbot cackles]

03:44.766 --> 03:45.850
No, you're right.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.436
I stand corrected.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.230
You're not a pet.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.107
You see, pets can be taught obedience.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.943
You're not obedient, are you?

03:56.027 --> 03:56.903
No.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.448
You gored one of my men
and you tried running away.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.036
Where did you think you were going?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.205
Home.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.123
Home.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.209
That's a quaint idea.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.212
Let me explain something to you.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.715
It's just a matter of time
before the whole world learns

04:17.715 --> 04:21.427
hybrids are the key to the cure.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.805
And when that happens, which it will,

04:23.805 --> 04:27.392
it won't matter how fast or far you run,

04:27.392 --> 04:29.686
no place will be safe.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.648
Everyone will want a piece of you.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.442
Let me ask you something.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.152
Why do you fight so hard

04:38.152 --> 04:42.031
to live in a world
which clearly doesn't want you?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.661
Maybe it's you the world doesn't want.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.210
Okay, maybe you can talk.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.506
But you lied
when you said you're not afraid.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.178
You're terrified.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.891
And so you should be.

05:09.934 --> 05:14.105
See, you're a fawn thrashing in its snare,

05:14.105 --> 05:16.274

05:17.608 --> 05:19.319
Stop fighting.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.699

05:28.369 --> 05:29.454
[Abbot] Easy does it.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.002
Attaboy. You will learn not to fight.

05:37.045 --> 05:42.425
Did you know us humans found useful
pretty much every part of the deer?

05:42.425 --> 05:45.511
Intestines, the hide, the tail...

05:48.222 --> 05:52.393
Even the fat can be slowly boiled down

- Stop!

[darkly bemused chuckle]

06:03.529 --> 06:05.656
You know, Dr. Singh, God bless him,

06:05.656 --> 06:09.077
he found useful the little stem cells

06:09.077 --> 06:12.330
you creatures have
tucked away inside your bones.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.958
You crack those open,

and ta-da!

[sinister music playing]

06:19.879 --> 06:21.672
We have a cure.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.301
I'm sorry, Bambi.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.637
I didn't make those rules.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.639
I just follow the science.

[footsteps approach]

06:30.556 --> 06:31.891
Of course,

prized above all else.

[Gus, desperately] Don't come any closer!

[distressing music swells]

07:09.679 --> 07:11.055
[startled clamoring]

07:32.743 --> 07:33.744
They took it.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.748
Why would they do that to you?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.586
To make us afraid.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.799
You guys were right.
I should've never trusted Dr. Singh.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.719

for one big experiment.

[delicate, emotional music playing]

07:58.269 --> 08:01.397
Did you know
that I've read every sign here at the zoo?

08:04.066 --> 08:06.277
There was one about the white-tailed deer.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.947
It says that when
a deer's antler falls off,

08:11.032 --> 08:12.408
it grows back...

08:13.868 --> 08:15.203
stronger.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.463
Hey.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.550
We're getting out of here.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.720
And we're going to be stronger than ever.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.681
Yeah.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.439
Blood oxygen,
respiratory levels holding steady.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.024
All right.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.567
Body temp.

08:47.652 --> 08:51.781
Uh, 97.2.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.491
Look at me, darling. Look at me.

08:55.034 --> 08:55.868
Ah.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.703
You look passable.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.790
Oh. Rude.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.749
[both chuckle]

09:03.376 --> 09:06.128
How are you?
I heard you practicing early this morning.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.839
I just can't wait
for all of this to be over.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.803
I hate that Abbot's dragging you
into this presentation of his.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.556
And inviting me to watch
is clearly a power play.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.140
The hard part's over.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.060
As long as we can walk out of here

09:22.103 --> 09:23.020
with the cure.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.188
[Rani] Mmm.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.275
[Rani] Should we let the chickens go
when we leave?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.526
- [computer beeps]
- Yeah?

09:30.194 --> 09:31.195
Adi?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.533
- What is it?
- It...

09:36.909 --> 09:38.536
It... It can't be.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.413
[tense music building]

09:41.998 --> 09:43.374
Does that mean...

09:43.374 --> 09:44.417
Oh God!

09:47.962 --> 09:51.173
I'll put some... of the new...

- [tray clatters]
- [chickens squawk]

[music intensifies]

10:05.855 --> 10:06.814
[beeps]

10:08.149 --> 10:09.567
The cure didn't work.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.402
What's happening?

10:12.069 --> 10:15.781
God! Something must've changed overnight!

10:15.781 --> 10:16.866
Ah!

10:16.866 --> 10:18.951
Adi. Okay, it's okay.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.911
- [Dr. Singh hyperventilating]

10:20.911 --> 10:22.496
Ah, don't touch me! Don't!

10:23.456 --> 10:24.290
Okay.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.920
[Dr. Singh's breathing evening out]

10:30.421 --> 10:31.464
I'm sorry.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.592
After all that,

10:36.385 --> 10:37.553
it failed.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.473
I failed.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.893
You did everything you could.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.772
[slow, distressed music playing]

10:47.772 --> 10:49.065
But it wasn't enough.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.070
It's okay.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.990
[Rani sighs]

11:00.409 --> 11:01.827
I can be done.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.958
I'm tired, Adi.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.421
I can't keep waiting to live.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.217
There must be something else we can do.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.511
[sighs]

11:26.852 --> 11:29.855
[Rani] Abbot expects your support
at the event today,

11:30.856 --> 11:33.234
to convince the Group of Three
he has the cure.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.948
- Oh God. Abbot is going to kill us.
- No. Don't you see?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.534
If you tell the truth,
that he never had the cure,

11:41.534 --> 11:45.079
then everything, his whole house of cards,
will come crashing down.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.082
No, I can't undermine him
in front of everyone.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.000
Says who?

11:52.086 --> 11:54.547
When those warlords find out,

11:55.798 --> 11:58.217
they are going to eat him alive.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.512
It's going to be absolute chaos.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.222
That's when we leave.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.891
This...

12:08.310 --> 12:09.812
This is our chance.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.942
If I give up on the cure, then you'll...

12:15.443 --> 12:18.070
[tense, agitated music pulsing]

12:27.955 --> 12:29.457
We will be free.

[somber music playing]

12:42.762 --> 12:43.763
Okay.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.223
- Hey.
- Yes...

12:48.142 --> 12:49.769
I'll do the top button.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.150
You can do this, Adi.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.695
You have more power than you think.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.530
[pounding at window]

13:01.530 --> 13:02.907
[startled clucking]

13:02.907 --> 13:03.991
[Last Man] Let's go.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.543
[Jordan] Target confirmed.

13:15.044 --> 13:19.340
One hybrid,
possibly of the feline variety.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.134
We can talk like normal people.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.095
- No sign of the parents?
- None.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.640
- All I see is a tail.
- Let me see those.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.105
[Jordan] What do you see?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.276
Might not be a hybrid after all.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.487
Should we call it off?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.030
No, we should go in.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.117
We're here for hybrids, nothing else.

13:47.117 --> 13:50.663
If I'm right about this,
it'll be better than capturing a hybrid.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.457
What's better than capturing a hybrid?

13:53.457 --> 13:56.001
Something much less innocent.

Hey, bestie.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.724
[both grunting]

14:53.767 --> 14:55.060
I always knew you were soft.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.897
But joining the Last Men,
that's a new low, even for you.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.153
You don't get to decide what the lows are,
not after your little coup!

15:18.375 --> 15:19.835
What are you even doing here?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.838
We heard there's something
going down at Essex Zoo.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.799
They're locking up hybrids there.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.094
We just needed a Last Man
to confirm our intel,

15:30.804 --> 15:31.847
and here you are.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.266
Your plan was
to waltz right into the city?

15:34.808 --> 15:36.518
You're no match for Abbot's army.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.354
You're gonna get people killed!

15:38.354 --> 15:39.480
[Tiger screams]

15:40.522 --> 15:41.982
[Tiger] That's the idea!

15:41.982 --> 15:44.151
[music swells]

15:44.151 --> 15:46.278
No, I mean Animal Army.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.072
Rhino, Pony.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.366
You.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.326
We're soldiers, Bear.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.287
[tense martial beat playing]

15:56.080 --> 15:58.040
No, we just thought we had to be.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.043
You never answered why you're here.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.461
I'm going to the zoo too.

16:03.212 --> 16:07.424
Gus is one of the hybrids they're holding.
I'm going to get him back.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.053
Not if I stop you first.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.348
I can't have you blowing our cover.

16:16.934 --> 16:17.935
[loud thud]

16:19.770 --> 16:21.730
[Jordan] Oh, man.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.358
Good thing I got here when I did.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.444
Uh, Sergeant's on his way.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.613
He's not gonna believe this.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.365
[Jordan chuckles]

16:32.366 --> 16:33.367
[indistinct chatter]

16:46.171 --> 16:47.172
[Abbot] Doctor.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.176
Everything in order?

16:52.511 --> 16:53.512
Yeah.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.556
Excellent.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.229
I can't afford to have any mistakes today.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.109
What a delightful dinner
we had last night.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.944
- We must do it again.
- Oh, yeah.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.697
Stage fright?

17:13.157 --> 17:17.619
I... I always preferred
one-on-one with my patients

17:18.245 --> 17:21.206
over... over giving talks.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.291
[Abbot] Hmm.

17:24.501 --> 17:29.214
Let me give you a little advice.
I usually think of my audience as puppets,

17:29.214 --> 17:31.133
and then I just pull the strings.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.385
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.679
[high-pitched whining]

17:35.679 --> 17:37.431
Do you hear what I hear?

17:38.849 --> 17:40.642
That's destiny calling our names.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.145
- [klaxon drones]
- [decontamination vents hissing]

17:43.145 --> 17:45.230
[strident, intimidating music playing]

17:47.566 --> 17:48.984
Congratulations, Abbot.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.112
You've made yourself impossible to ignore.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.324
I take it word of my little tour
reached the lowlands.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.533
Oh, you know it did.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.660
You've always known how to work a crowd.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.331
It warms my heart to know you've managed
to put our little differences aside

18:02.331 --> 18:04.166
and do what's best for your territory.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.751
I prayed for you.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.377
[klaxon blares]

18:07.377 --> 18:10.089
Ah! You must be Voss!

18:10.089 --> 18:12.800
- I never had the privilege--
- So this is where you keep the Centauri.

18:14.802 --> 18:15.803
Hybrids.

18:16.804 --> 18:21.350
Yes, the extraterrestrial invaders.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.561
Don't worry, Voss.
My men have them under lock and key.

18:24.561 --> 18:28.107
I thought your hostility
towards the Centauri only angered them.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.359
But then I heard about your cure.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.862
Thanks to my rock-star scientist,

18:34.404 --> 18:37.116
we are one step closer to passing it...

18:38.784 --> 18:41.495
[Voss] The unbelievers are
dying in droves.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.374
- But we will endure.
- [Voss's entourage] We will endure.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.001
[nervously] Yeah, we'll endure.

18:52.422 --> 18:56.426
I'll hand it to ya, I didn't think
you'd manage to get <i>her</i> attention.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.887
[intimidating music intensifies]

19:04.518 --> 19:06.895
Ah, there she is.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.439
Like a rose in the desert.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.400
Mrs. Zhang.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.528
Oh, General, please! Call me Helen.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.031
So nice to finally meet you in your zoo.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.116
Hmm.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.451
Well, thank you
for accepting the invitation,

19:21.451 --> 19:23.954
taking time away
from your war with the Baron.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.957
I'd hardly call
that little skirmish a war.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.043
Well, I'm not getting
any younger. [chuckles]

19:30.794 --> 19:34.006
You didn't invite us here
to just hand out the cure, did you?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.218
Ladies and gentlemen.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.847
It's time to talk about our future.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.973
It's time.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.059
We've slowed him down.
We've studied his every move.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.352
This is our one chance.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.439
We're done being prisoners
in our own home.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.525
Teddy, do you have the sunblock?
You know what to do.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.236
Once we're out of the Kennels,
we head for the south gate.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.322
First we have to get through the atrium.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.532
Gus, we'll follow your lead through there.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.075
[Finn] Really?

20:02.826 --> 20:04.411
You're sure about this?

20:04.995 --> 20:06.163
- We're ready.
- [Finn] No.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.081
This.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.379
I trust him.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.382
He's one of us.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.468
[kids clamoring in assent]

20:20.552 --> 20:21.678
Is everyone in?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.057
[brave, resolute music playing]

20:36.193 --> 20:37.194
[Jepp huffing]

20:41.198 --> 20:42.199
[breaths echoing]

20:45.327 --> 20:46.745
[thunder rumbling]

20:51.875 --> 20:52.960
Are you Ash?

20:52.960 --> 20:56.213
Yep. And you are the hybrid catcher.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.548
[Ash] <i>I gotta tell you, man.</i>

20:58.548 --> 21:00.467
It is crazy how many of those things--

21:00.467 --> 21:03.053
Marlin said you might know
where my family is.

21:03.053 --> 21:03.971
[Ash chuckles]

21:05.013 --> 21:07.557
Not exactly a conversationalist, are we?

21:09.226 --> 21:10.394
Makes sense, though.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.938
Spend enough time
alone with those things and...

21:12.938 --> 21:13.897
[startled grunt]

21:14.773 --> 21:17.901
If you know where my family is,
you better tell me right now!

21:17.901 --> 21:19.361
Shit, man! Okay!

21:23.282 --> 21:25.284
[delicate, unsettling music playing]

21:28.370 --> 21:30.205
It's a rare thing these days,

21:31.873 --> 21:33.292
getting answers.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.713
[Ash grunts]

21:45.470 --> 21:46.763
What the hell is this?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.224
Sorry for your loss, man.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.769
[sorrowful music playing]

22:11.538 --> 22:13.498
[storm rumbles]

22:21.089 --> 22:22.591
- [choked sob]
- [thunder cracks]

22:25.218 --> 22:27.387
[sharp, mournful sobbing]

22:27.387 --> 22:30.307
[narrator] <i>The Big Man
had given everything.</i>

22:31.141 --> 22:33.977
[anguished wail]

22:33.977 --> 22:37.189
[narrator] <i>But somehow, he lost even more.</i>

22:42.944 --> 22:44.863
[sorrowful music trails off]

22:46.490 --> 22:49.159
In the town where I grew up,
there was a wooden bridge.

22:50.118 --> 22:55.791
Rickety old thing,
and rain, hail, snow ate away at it.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.753
I kind of knew that
one day it was going to collapse,

22:59.753 --> 23:03.048
but nobody in town
listened to little Dougie.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.132
No.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.677
Government built it,
government knows best.

23:09.221 --> 23:13.683
And eventually when it did collapse,
it took two innocent men with it.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.061
It's a funny thing.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.440
People only start listening
once someone dies.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.025
[low, unsettling music playing]

23:25.445 --> 23:29.282
Our illustrious Dr. Singh
is going to paint a picture

23:29.282 --> 23:34.371
of the most important bridge
in our collective paths.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.497
Doctor.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.082
Right.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.345
Uh, what if I told you
someone in this audience right now

23:51.555 --> 23:52.514
has the Sick?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.349
[entourage frets]

23:59.688 --> 24:00.730
In this, uh...

24:02.482 --> 24:04.443
Oh God, uh...

24:04.443 --> 24:07.404
...hypothetical scenario,

24:07.404 --> 24:12.993
the Doomsday strain would kill
half the people here by next week.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.329
But not before
those people transmitted the virus

24:16.329 --> 24:20.917
to another dozen people each.

24:20.917 --> 24:27.174
Okay, that's 80 deaths resulting directly
from one single event.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.136
The, um... The original virus killed

24:32.053 --> 24:36.349
98% of the population.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.897
As a physician,
I... I witnessed this firsthand.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.317
This new strain...

24:47.110 --> 24:48.153
We are looking at...

24:50.155 --> 24:54.034
99... and rising fast.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.786
It finds us,

24:58.205 --> 24:59.498
kills us.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.793
It clearly can't be contained.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.798
So, where is this goddamn cure?

25:10.008 --> 25:13.428
Well, the truth is...

25:15.388 --> 25:17.933
[unsettling music intensifies]

25:17.933 --> 25:20.185
The truth is...

25:24.356 --> 25:27.025
that the cure
is our only way to beat this.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.575
[distressing music builds]

25:39.329 --> 25:41.039
But we don't have enough of it.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.669
It requires a somewhat...

25:46.586 --> 25:49.506
unconventional ingredient that is--

25:49.506 --> 25:51.383
Now, now. Thank you. Good job.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.760
We're not here to reveal trade secrets.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.555
Johnny!

26:18.076 --> 26:19.619
This is Evergreen.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.706
This is how we defeat the Sick.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.334
[guard 1] Bro, you're up.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.641
- [guard 2's voice] Lunchtime, freaks!
- [guard 2] Lu--

26:47.689 --> 26:49.941
[guard 2's voice] Lunchtime, freaks!

26:52.152 --> 26:54.571
[suspenseful, disconcerting music playing]

27:00.285 --> 27:03.288
What the hell are you all up to now, huh?

27:16.426 --> 27:17.552
The shit?

27:18.053 --> 27:20.263
[as guard 2] Lunchtime, freaks!

27:20.930 --> 27:23.975
[cattle prod amping up]

27:25.769 --> 27:27.020
[electricity sparks]

27:30.649 --> 27:31.483
Now!

27:31.483 --> 27:33.485
[rousing music playing]

27:33.485 --> 27:34.486
[startled gasp]

27:39.658 --> 27:40.909
[sputtering]

27:44.996 --> 27:47.957
Dear God, no!

27:50.335 --> 27:53.296
[gagging]

27:55.423 --> 27:57.133
Oh, you're all gonna pay for this.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.179
[music intensifies]

28:08.395 --> 28:09.479
[prod amping up]

28:10.063 --> 28:11.189
Looking for this?

28:12.315 --> 28:14.651
- [shock discharging]
- [incoherent spluttering]

28:21.199 --> 28:22.909
- Yeah!
- We did it!

28:22.909 --> 28:24.411
[excited cheering]

28:24.411 --> 28:28.581
[intense vocalizing]

28:28.581 --> 28:29.582
What'd she say?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.418
I think you can guess.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.378
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.088
Follow Gus, one by one.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.173
[tense, adventurous music playing]

28:50.812 --> 28:52.814
[tense, adventurous music continuing]

28:56.234 --> 28:58.236
[indistinct radio chatter]

29:07.078 --> 29:09.914
It was just a rumor in my early Army days,

29:09.914 --> 29:13.168
this unfinished
housing development long-forgotten.

29:13.918 --> 29:17.881
Fifty-three lush acres
with everything we'll ever need.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.300
It's fortified with a 30-foot-high wall

29:20.300 --> 29:22.427
to keep all unwanted elements
on the other side.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.179
Mrs. Zhang,

29:24.179 --> 29:25.472
Voss,

29:25.472 --> 29:27.056
Dutch,

29:27.056 --> 29:29.309
I'm offering you a place in Evergreen,

29:29.309 --> 29:34.397
alongside 150 of your best people, each.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.316
[Dutch] A hundred and fifty?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.109
And what about the rest?

29:38.109 --> 29:40.987
I hate to break this to you,
but it's too late for them.

29:40.987 --> 29:45.950
Either we save a select few,
or we all fall to the Sick.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.078
You want us
to pick and choose who survives?

29:49.078 --> 29:51.873
Did you pay attention to the good doctor?

29:51.873 --> 29:55.335
Either you choose,
or the Sick will choose for you.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.836
What's the price of entry?

29:56.836 --> 29:59.547
[Abbot] As you can see,
I have the infrastructure.

30:00.381 --> 30:04.093
I have the personnel to maintain it.
I have the cure.

30:05.303 --> 30:08.056
But the truth is,
I don't have the resources

30:08.056 --> 30:12.769
to maintain a city of this magnitude
in solitary confinement for up to a year,

30:12.769 --> 30:14.771
which is what it will take.
Am I right, Doctor?

30:14.771 --> 30:15.814
That's correct.

30:16.314 --> 30:21.778
Mrs. Zhang, you have mastered the art
of agriculture in our post-Crumble world.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.613
We will never know hunger.

30:23.613 --> 30:27.200
Dutch, you have a river
running alongside Evergreen.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.577
