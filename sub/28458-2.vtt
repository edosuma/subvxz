00:04.963 --> 00:09.508
Reality showdown, 11 teams from
"Survivor," "Big brother," and.

00:09.509 --> 00:14.178
"The amazing race" line up on
The starting line and begin a.

00:14.179 --> 00:16.931
Race around the world.

00:16.932 --> 00:19.935
In tech yoark new racers were
Overwhelmed.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.854
This is way harder than
"Survivor."

00:21.855 --> 00:24.355
While a returning
Team used familiar tricks.

00:24.356 --> 00:27.401
Pretend that we're fighting
To throw other teams off,

00:27.402 --> 00:28.651
Because they were all following
Us.

00:28.652 --> 00:32.322
And two japanese game
Show inspired roadblocks, teams.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.575
Chomped down and climbed up.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.325
Yeah, court.

00:36.326 --> 00:39.955
You are team number One.

00:39.956 --> 00:44.167
Art and j.J. Took a penalty,
Giving rupert and laura the.

00:44.168 --> 00:47.254
Chance they needed and sending
The border patrol agents home.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.380
You've been eliminated from the
Race.

00:49.381 --> 00:50.715
Ten teams remain.

00:50.716 --> 00:58.556
Who will be eliminated next?

00:58.557 --> 01:01.852
Let's go, baby, let's go.

01:01.853 --> 01:02.728
All right.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.855
Fly to laos.

01:05.856 --> 01:09.443
Leo will be first to
Leave japan's most populated.

01:09.444 --> 01:13.405
City, flying to luang prabang in
Laos, the only land-locked.

01:13.406 --> 01:17.867
Country.

01:17.868 --> 01:21.455
When they arrive, they will
Travel by tuk-tuk to their next.

01:21.456 --> 01:21.956
Clue.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.331
I love tuk-tuks.

01:23.332 --> 01:24.167
Let's go.

01:24.168 --> 01:28.253
We are leaving tokyo in first
Place.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.298
We redeemed ourselves in japan.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.423
Redemption is out.

01:32.424 --> 01:37.971
Now we have to focus on leg two
Of the race.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.056
Tickets today?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.724
The other teams from
"Survivor" and "Big brother".

01:41.725 --> 01:43.602
Really don't have an idea what
To expect.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.603
It only gets tougher.

01:44.604 --> 01:50.066
It's not easier.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.109
Here we go.

01:52.110 --> 01:52.444
Iaos.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.611
Let's go.

01:53.612 --> 01:57.824
In the last 15 years,
Christie and I have both grown a.

01:57.825 --> 01:58.950
Ton.

01:58.951 --> 02:00.285
Watching season five and how
Intense and frantic I was...

02:00.286 --> 02:03.955
there's no contract.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.456
We have a flight to make.

02:05.457 --> 02:07.792
We don't have time to do That.

02:07.793 --> 02:09.001
$100.

02:09.002 --> 02:12.422
I think we noticed along the
Way that doesn't necessarily.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.174
Help you get anywhere any
Faster.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.466
Pick up your tickets today.

02:15.467 --> 02:19.429
For probably first ten years
Of are you aware relationship we.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.555
Fought all the time.

02:20.556 --> 02:25.102
Now both of our daily
Practice is meditation and yoga.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.271
It's about being present and
Enjoying the moment.

02:28.272 --> 02:30.607
That's part of our intention
This time around.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.150
We have to get tickets here and
Then we go to the airport.

02:33.151 --> 02:34.443
My god, laos.

02:34.444 --> 02:38.657
Coming back on "The race" is
A once-in-a-lifetime thing.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.286
So many teams have run it before
That would give anything to come.

02:42.287 --> 02:42.996
Back.

02:42.997 --> 02:46.999
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.172
I think leo and jambalaya
Would use the um u-turn against.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.340
Us.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.634
The smartest thing to do is
Get the strongest team out.

02:58.635 --> 03:01.513
"Big brother" and "Survivor"
Teams have their own paranoia.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.014
This is "The amazing race."

03:02.015 --> 03:03.639
look at her kimono.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.349
She looks so pretty.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.894
It's so fun to have my sister
With me.

03:07.895 --> 03:08.771
She's my best friend.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.688
It's so hard to not have my
Hubby here.

03:10.689 --> 03:13.859
Because I miss my little bear.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.526
But we're kind of intense.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.654
I'm trying my hardest.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.864
Let's give up.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.991
Why do you always say that?

03:21.992 --> 03:23.911
I hate you right now.

03:23.912 --> 03:29.374
With my sister, we're fun.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.501
We had our babe yes, sir at
The same time.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.127
We're both busy moms.

03:33.128 --> 03:35.714
When phil says go, it's game On.

03:35.715 --> 03:36.882
All bets are off.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.090
Let's go.

03:38.091 --> 03:39.383
Pick up your ticket.

03:39.384 --> 03:42.888
While traveling in lowrks you
Should wear pants and shirt that.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.347
Cover your shoulder and stomach.

03:44.348 --> 03:46.682
Hawaiian shirts are coming Out.

03:46.683 --> 03:49.770
Here we go, here we go, here
We go.

03:49.771 --> 03:54.149
We had a couple hiccup, but
We did great with each other.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.400
We have been dating for about
A year.

03:56.401 --> 03:57.610
We met on "Big brother."

03:57.611 --> 04:01.073
after the show we started
Dating, and the rest is history.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.281
Yep.

04:02.282 --> 04:04.910
We're a lot more confident
Going into this leg than we were.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.578
Into the first leg.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.579
But never feel comfortable.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.080
That's the same on "Big
Brother."

04:09.081 --> 04:13.418
You feel comfortable, you're
Probably going to get out.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.127
Get the tickets today.

04:15.128 --> 04:16.088
There we go.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.588
Can we book some flights?

04:17.589 --> 04:18.880
Right here, buddy.

04:18.882 --> 04:19.634
Thank you.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.966
Tickets?

04:20.968 --> 04:22.469
All right.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.679
Perfect.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.429
Sigh noor a.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.556
I see it.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.015
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

04:28.016 --> 04:28.643
To the airport.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.601
Hey, friend.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.895
Do you want to work together
To find this?

04:31.896 --> 04:33.270
I don't see why not.

04:33.271 --> 04:35.691
I don't see anybody else.

04:35.692 --> 04:40.111
So we're working together.

04:40.112 --> 04:42.780
And we're like fun 2.0.

04:42.781 --> 04:43.907
Right here.

04:43.908 --> 04:44.449
Nick, you see them?

04:44.450 --> 04:45.908
Who do you see?

04:45.909 --> 04:47.326
Team fun?

04:47.327 --> 04:48.328
That's it right there.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.289
We can all go together and
Explore the area.

04:51.290 --> 04:51.874
Okay.

04:51.874 --> 04:52.457
Wait.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.458
They're going.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.919
It says near don quixote.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.087
Maybe it's on the other side.

04:58.088 --> 04:59.506
I guess we're not working
Together.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.299
They just left us.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.592
They didn't not like team fun
2.0.

05:03.593 --> 05:06.179
Did they find it?

05:06.180 --> 05:08.056
We're just getting Directions.

05:08.057 --> 05:12.352
I am not a look kim I have
Been on "Big brother" and "The.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.477
Amazing race."

05:13.478 --> 05:16.355
It's a huge advantage to know
You can count on people.

05:16.356 --> 05:17.482
We know we're not going to be
Working with them.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.150
That's okay.

05:19.151 --> 05:20.193
We'll do it on our own.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.611
We're going to the airport.

05:21.612 --> 05:22.653
All right.

05:22.654 --> 05:26.366
The airport.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.160
My legs.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.119
Have a good day.

05:30.120 --> 05:30.913
Sayonara.

05:30.914 --> 05:35.042
This is all the yen I have Left.

05:35.043 --> 05:35.959
I have u.S. Dollars.

05:35.960 --> 05:41.672
If I had a funometer, it would
Be at zero.

05:41.673 --> 05:44.633
The racers have a leg up, but
We're experienced travelers.

05:44.634 --> 05:46.677
We learned from our mistakes
From the first leg, and we'll do.

05:46.678 --> 05:47.596
A lot better today.

05:47.597 --> 05:51.390
It's 500 a.M. And I'm
Already sweating.

05:51.391 --> 05:52.350
There he is.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.686
You made it.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.980
My god.

05:57.981 --> 05:59.023
I thought we were out.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.859
I thought we were out.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.986
By the grace of god...

06:02.987 --> 06:04.446
we're still here.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.198
We are still here.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.364
I'm thrilled.

06:07.365 --> 06:08.657
We're thrilled.

06:08.658 --> 06:13.080
We spent four hours in that park
Running around looking for a.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.374
Hidden immunity idol, not a damn
Clue box.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.419
We're used to being tricked
On "Survivor."

06:19.420 --> 06:23.006
we're super excited to race
With the legend rupert and his.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.007
Wife.

06:24.007 --> 06:24.716
I didn't think I would see
You guys anymore.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.220
I mean, huge fans of rupert.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.221
Huge fans.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.472
Come here.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.267
We want to see if we can advance
Some of these survivors to the.

06:34.268 --> 06:34.726
End.

06:34.726 --> 06:35.603
Going to laos.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.727
Wish they had a bigger plane.

06:36.728 --> 06:37.895
Let's get back in race mode.

06:37.896 --> 06:41.732
Got all the teams on the same
Flight and we're ready to do.

06:41.733 --> 06:42.317
This.

06:42.317 --> 06:43.194
We just caught back up.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.652
We're not going to give up.

06:44.653 --> 06:46.237
Our bar is set very low.

06:46.238 --> 06:48.280
We just want to beat one Team.

06:48.281 --> 06:50.741
We want to keep in the race and
Keep getting more knowledge,

06:50.742 --> 06:56.749
Keep getting more experience,
And knock this newbie out of us.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:01.771 --> 08:04.648
There he is.
The courier is coming right.

08:04.649 --> 08:07.318
There.

08:07.319 --> 08:07.944
Go.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.528
I got it.

08:09.529 --> 08:13.866
Make your way to give to the
Mongs.

08:13.867 --> 08:18.662
It takes place every sunrise
And chance for locals to give.

08:18.663 --> 08:21.833
Back to these dedicated mompings
And teams will now do as they.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.628
Start with this leg of the race.

08:25.629 --> 08:31.676
Taking it.
I don't think it is so.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.677
Horrible.
This looks like a monster.

08:33.678 --> 08:35.138
So close.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.889
Two of these?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.683
I can't believe we got here
First.

08:39.683 --> 08:42.854
We were so close.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.065
If you take it all the way
Down there.

08:45.066 --> 08:53.066
Behind us.
Stay on the road to the pal ace.

08:59.663 --> 09:00.581
They were throwing bodies.
Come on!

09:00.581 --> 09:01.499
Doing it on "Survivor."

09:01.499 --> 09:02.124
Run like a snake and don't get a
Plow dart.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.083
You got to be kidding me.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.542
Looks like they were having
The most fun.

09:05.543 --> 09:10.257
A fan of theirs.
And just weren't that fun or.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.258
Helpful.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.176
If they were none of the above.
They beat us.

09:14.177 --> 09:17.388
We were really close.
That was a waste.

09:17.389 --> 09:19.516
Thank you. >> Thank you.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.308
Are you getting it?

09:21.309 --> 09:29.309
Thank you. Help us right now.

09:29.735 --> 09:34.196
Going to calm a snake.

09:34.197 --> 09:35.364
I don't think we have insurance.

09:35.365 --> 09:43.365
I saw you.

09:56.928 --> 10:04.928
We are all setting in rows.

10:10.942 --> 10:16.114
And the sun coming up and
Hearing the drums and the.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.950
Temple. It is really spiritual.

10:18.951 --> 10:26.291
What is so amazing, they are
Holding space for our collective.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.793
Conscience and blasting out love
And compassion.

10:29.794 --> 10:34.924
They are helping our world,
Tapping into that was pretty.

10:44.976 --> 10:48.021
And search for your next clue.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.316
What are we running toward?

10:51.317 --> 10:56.153
The mek ompnmp g river.

10:56.154 --> 11:01.993
And I'm total about getting
Energy.

11:01.994 --> 11:08.374
They are a strong team.
That is the mekong river.

11:08.375 --> 11:13.963
Keep your eyes peeled. Tree.

11:13.964 --> 11:18.634
This is it. >> And I see arrows.

11:18.635 --> 11:21.303
And it says u-turn.

11:21.304 --> 11:28.311
Double u-turn.
I was supersurprised to turn.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.187
On. >> This is insane.

11:30.188 --> 11:31.855
I don't know.

11:31.856 --> 11:34.901
People could be closing in,
Guys.

11:34.902 --> 11:38.529
Say who wants a u-turn.

11:38.530 --> 11:42.075
It's on us.
I don't think we should.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.411
I mean, we should.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.372
People are closing in. Rachel.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.374
Fine.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.839
I don't know.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.008
It's a game.
See if you can get there.

12:00.009 --> 12:02.095
Not really a friend.
We tried to work with them in

12:02.096 --> 12:05.723
Japan and didn't want to work
With us.

12:05.724 --> 12:11.521
Detour, ?
You are listening to the lao.

12:11.522 --> 12:17.609
Alphabet and impossible to pick
Out the subtle differences.

12:17.610 --> 12:22.949
Between each letter, which is
Why we are having teams learn.

12:22.950 --> 12:28.245
The lao alphabet and take a
Test.

12:28.246 --> 12:31.250
Trust me. This is a tough crowd.

12:36.379 --> 12:41.216
The lao barbecue, they are
Time consuming.

12:41.217 --> 12:44.220
To help them.
They must prepare secures like.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.763
These.

12:46.764 --> 12:47.475
I say barbecue.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.099
We are going to barbecue.

12:49.100 --> 12:55.064
Come on. Let someone else do it.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.149
U-turn.

12:57.150 --> 13:03.781
Make them? >> Yeah.

13:03.782 --> 13:09.454
Luckily teams in front did
Not u-turn us.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.331
And jamal is like, wait.

13:12.332 --> 13:16.127
The sisters.
As we got closer, we started.

13:16.128 --> 13:21.590
Seeing our faces and we were
Shocked.

13:21.591 --> 13:25.637
That can't be happening.
I was like, that just happened.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.471
They are a strong team.

13:27.472 --> 13:31.433
I'm sorry. Tyler and korey.

13:31.434 --> 13:36.272
Just got u-turn. Barbeque.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.066
We got your guys' back.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.652
We'll help you guys, too.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.071
My god. My god.

13:43.072 --> 13:47.157
Was I surprised to see our faces
On the u-turn board?

13:47.158 --> 13:55.158
We have to run a perfect leg out
If we are going to survive this.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.043
I think we should do Barbecue.

13:58.044 --> 14:02.215
We are going to do it.
Teams down here, too.

14:02.216 --> 14:06.301
They might do a different One.

14:06.302 --> 14:08.971
This is easier.

14:08.972 --> 14:13.142
We are running uphill.
"Big brother" did not prepare.

14:13.143 --> 14:18.273
Us for the exhaust of the race.
Probably averaged 14 hours of.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.856
Sleep a day.

14:19.857 --> 14:22.026
We have to shop for ingredients.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.737
We were so tired and so grouchy.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.739
Headed to barbecue alley?

14:27.740 --> 14:30.200
Yes. >> Pick a tee-shirt.

14:30.201 --> 14:35.539
Thank you.
You had to pick a tee-shirt.

14:35.540 --> 14:41.838
Who would teach you the abc's in
La oonch.

14:46.509 --> 14:50.178
You could be saying something
In one way or lower or raise the.

14:50.179 --> 14:55.058
Tone of your voice to get it
Exactly right.

14:55.059 --> 15:02.024
And there were like 10 different
Veerings of...

15:02.025 --> 15:04.735
got it.

15:04.736 --> 15:10.199
Going into the barbecue Alley.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.577
Local farmers' market out Here.

15:26.591 --> 15:30.927

Demonstration.

15:30.928 --> 15:35.767
Three ducks.
We had to prepare raw duck.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.894
And raw tilapia.

15:38.895 --> 15:41.480
Gut the fish ap the ducks.

15:41.481 --> 15:46.152
Get the ingredients and talk
About preparing it later.

15:46.153 --> 15:50.072
Quack. Quack.

15:50.073 --> 15:52.282
That's crazy.

15:52.283 --> 15:56.787
Got the ducks.

15:56.788 --> 16:00.124
Here's the guts. >> Fish.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.792

17:17.492 --> 17:18.661
Person saying car?

17:18.662 --> 17:20.412
That is true.

17:20.413 --> 17:26.376
I smell barbecue here.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.057
do you want to command an
Elephant?

29:30.058 --> 29:30.894
Yeah.

29:30.895 --> 29:35.605
This is the best road olympic
Ever!

29:35.606 --> 29:37.607
I love you!

29:37.608 --> 29:41.277
This is worth a million
Dollars right here.

29:41.278 --> 29:42.778
Whoo!

29:42.779 --> 29:45.114
Good job.

29:45.115 --> 29:48.036
My life is made.

Ok.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.132
Ok. >> Wait.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.300
There is no way.

30:04.301 --> 30:12.301
I'm going to bare back.
I meant like in...

30:13.478 --> 30:18.356
that was incredible. Good job.

30:18.357 --> 30:24.820
Are we going through looking
For music and find our next.

30:24.821 --> 30:26.239
Clue? >> Yeah.

30:26.240 --> 30:30.993
Got to do it.

30:30.994 --> 30:34.664
My god, they are passing Us.

30:34.665 --> 30:38.376
My god. That is another team.

30:38.377 --> 30:43.673
My god, they dl both
Detours and passed us.

30:43.674 --> 30:45.508
I'll do it.

30:45.509 --> 30:46.551
You sure?

30:46.552 --> 30:49.345
I'll see you back on an
Elephant.

30:49.346 --> 30:53.307
Who is going to on that
Elephant?

30:53.308 --> 30:57.479
Who likes to be in tandem?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.272
I'll do it.

30:58.273 --> 31:04.361
I'll do it. >> High-five.

31:04.362 --> 31:07.154
High five.
You got to get that guy to.

31:07.155 --> 31:13.161
Go.
I know, it's more the energy.

31:13.162 --> 31:17.708
Just take deep breaths.
I find they don't like to be.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.501
Yelled at.

31:20.502 --> 31:23.880
Real chill.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.214
Ok.

31:25.215 --> 31:30.720
What do I do?
When I got my elephant I saw

31:30.721 --> 31:34.266
Rupert still learning what was
Going on and I saw in front of.

31:34.267 --> 31:42.267
Me chris and becca.

31:45.111 --> 31:52.617
Me chris and becca.

31:52.618 --> 31:53.118
What is that?

31:53.119 --> 31:56.579
Is that music?

31:56.580 --> 31:58.332
Yeah.

31:58.333 --> 32:02.960
That's it.

32:02.961 --> 32:06.757
I got the clue.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.468
I cannot open it until I see
Leo.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.928
Thank you. Thank you.

32:11.929 --> 32:15.766
I only got one more, ok?

32:15.767 --> 32:21.771
We are swimming like elephants.
Whoo!

32:21.772 --> 32:25.107
And I got the best princess
Here.

32:25.108 --> 32:32.615
My elephant is on g.P.S.
Are we going the right way?

32:32.616 --> 32:36.912
It doesn't get any better than
This.

32:36.913 --> 32:44.913
Whoo! Whoo!

32:48.965 --> 32:51.926
Whoo! Looks like a big ellfapt.

32:51.927 --> 32:55.137
Party in the water.
We are all riding elephants in.

32:55.138 --> 32:56.306
The water.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.684
Whoo!

32:59.685 --> 33:02.688
They are coming out of the
Banks.

33:02.689 --> 33:07.651
They are right next to each
Other.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.487
Ok.

33:10.488 --> 33:15.991
This is the slowest footrace I
Have ever seen.

33:15.992 --> 33:19.162
You already got your clue?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.997
Yeah.

33:20.998 --> 33:23.208
Right back to where you Started.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.210
Come on nicole. >> Thank you.

33:26.211 --> 33:28.171

33:31.425 --> 33:33.551
Run.

33:33.552 --> 33:34.511
Run!

33:34.512 --> 33:40.182
Great job.
After traveling by them, they.

33:40.183 --> 33:44.813
Must go on a speed boat.

33:44.814 --> 33:49.358
Here on the banks of the
Beautiful mekong river, the last.

33:49.359 --> 33:53.028
Team to check in here may be
Eliminated.

33:53.029 --> 33:54.364
We may be eliminated.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.365
Come on.

33:55.366 --> 33:59.827
Let's go. >> That's in.

33:59.828 --> 34:02.538
Number one.

34:02.539 --> 34:05.416
Go. Go!

34:05.417 --> 34:10.545
That's it.
That was just an incredible.

34:10.547 --> 34:13.759
Thing ever. Dream come true.

34:13.760 --> 34:18.431
I think we will be able to
Catch up.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.353
How can you control a wild
Animal.

34:26.355 --> 34:32.444
It's on its own agenda and
Not caring we are in a race.

34:32.445 --> 34:36.656
I don't think becca is in the
Water yet.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.492
Good job.

34:37.493 --> 34:45.246
Here is another time behind
Them.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.292
Please, god, please.
This is insanity I can.

34:48.293 --> 34:51.045
Control this elephant.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.380
It does what it wants.

35:01.641 --> 35:06.102
Thank you. >> Thank you.

35:06.103 --> 35:09.647
Nice girl. >> Hi, everyone.

35:09.648 --> 35:14.276

35:14.277 --> 35:19.741
You are going the right way.
I love the music.

35:19.742 --> 35:26.455
Where am I go go?

35:26.456 --> 35:28.124
We have to go.

35:28.125 --> 35:33.046
And emon our way to a pit Spot.

35:33.047 --> 35:37.341
What the hell is going on?
Thank you so much.

35:37.342 --> 35:42.138
I'm so happy.

35:42.139 --> 35:50.139
It should be elephant speed.

35:50.481 --> 35:58.446
We didn't come here to lose.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.991
Please, baby, please.

36:00.992 --> 36:05.328
I lovell fants.
Everybody is passing us and.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.997
We are in last place.
Elephants have been our.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.372
Spirit guides.

36:08.373 --> 36:11.292
You are killing me.

36:11.293 --> 36:13.627
Possessed that strength I always
Wanted.

36:13.628 --> 36:15.504
I can't depend on an Elephant.

36:15.505 --> 36:17.507
I love you too much.

36:21.887 --> 36:26.473
This is to be enjoyable and you
Are my ellfapt guide and you are.

36:26.474 --> 36:33.480
Killing me. Killing me.

36:33.481 --> 36:36.359
Big loveable mass, hard to talk
To and hard to instruct.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.988
Very loveable.

36:39.989 --> 36:44.491
Great elephant.

36:44.492 --> 36:51.540
I'm coming, thank you.
They got it right there.

36:51.541 --> 36:55.544
Come on, nick.
We are going to make them come.

36:55.545 --> 36:58.339
Back. >> This is not it.

36:58.340 --> 37:01.926
He said it is not it.

37:01.927 --> 37:03.053

37:16.358 --> 37:23.531
You are in the right spot.
Let's go!

37:23.532 --> 37:25.408
Let's go! Let's go.

37:25.409 --> 37:29.245
We have to keep running, Nick.

37:29.246 --> 37:31.580
I knew we were in the right
Place.

37:31.581 --> 37:37.419
Go.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.546
I'm, sorry.

37:39.547 --> 37:41.258
They were lying to you.

37:41.259 --> 37:45.595
I don't want to leave her.
The last team checking in may.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.765
Be eliminated.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.767
Go.

37:50.768 --> 37:51.892
Go. Go!

37:51.893 --> 37:57.607
Look at that elephant.
Does it have a faster gear?

37:57.608 --> 38:02.529
We are in third place. >> Go!

38:02.530 --> 38:03.654
Go! Go!

38:03.655 --> 38:05.991
Whoo!

38:05.992 --> 38:09.953

38:09.954 --> 38:13.288
Whoo!

38:13.289 --> 38:20.796
Working it.

38:20.797 --> 38:24.174

Let's do it. >> Go!

38:29.806 --> 38:32.683

38:32.684 --> 38:37.439
I got it. >> We got this.

39:16.519 --> 39:21.691
It is bittersweet.
When you are close in the.

39:21.692 --> 39:25.527
Race.
The animal said we were going.

39:25.528 --> 39:26.613
The wrong way.

39:26.614 --> 39:27.614
I won't listen to them.

39:27.615 --> 39:33.160
Going from sixth totaling
Second is awesome.

39:33.161 --> 39:34.121
This way.

39:34.122 --> 39:39.334
We just want to go right there.
Thank you.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.710
Run. Run home.

39:41.711 --> 39:49.593
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
We rise from the waters.

39:49.594 --> 39:54.890
Hurry!

39:54.891 --> 39:59.270
Rupert is coming.

39:59.271 --> 40:04.567

40:12.534 --> 40:17.080

40:36.182 --> 40:41.104
We survived.
We have seen a u-turn be a.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.732
Death sentence.
To know we survived it puts.

40:44.733 --> 40:50.654
Confidence in our step.

40:51.824 --> 40:58.955
That was a tough one, man.
I'm so sorry laura.

Maybe it's not elimination.

41:07.547 --> 41:14.345

We survived!

41:16.264 --> 41:20.893

The.

41:26.150 --> 41:30.361
We found it.
We were able to complete two.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.988
Challenges in the time that it
Took other challengers to.

41:32.989 --> 41:36.951
Complete one.
We don't plan ongoing home any.

41:36.952 --> 41:44.042
Time soon.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.008
Arrive.
Unfortunately, you have been.

41:52.009 --> 41:58.180
Eliminated from the race.
I considered myself one of.

41:58.181 --> 42:02.685
The toughest "Survivors" out
There and "Amazing race" kicked.

42:02.686 --> 42:07.857
My ass. >> The good news is...

42:07.858 --> 42:13.696

"Amazing race" is big.

42:13.697 --> 42:17.158
Spectrum and married 21 years.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.701
Been friends for 25.
Hopefully we have another 25.

42:19.702 --> 42:22.748
Years of adventures ahead of us.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.891
Stay tuned for scenes from
Our next episode.

42:46.688 --> 42:51.734
Next on "Amazing race"...
Teams light up the dance floor.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.696
I'm feeling this.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.029
While corinne and eliza feel.

42:56.030 --> 42:59.575
The pinch.

42:59.576 --> 43:03.913
And others feel the pressure.
