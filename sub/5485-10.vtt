14:18.807 --> 14:20.775
Reach out your hand

14:22.912 --> 14:25.514

14:44.967 --> 14:46.167
Perhaps.

14:46.201 --> 14:47.401

14:49.071 --> 14:51.673
If you deceive her
or cause her harm in any way,

14:51.707 --> 14:53.875
you will be met with the wrath

15:16.097 --> 15:17.831

15:17.865 --> 15:19.065
Yes.

15:23.171 --> 15:25.339
She knows who holds the priest

15:26.508 --> 15:28.041

indeed extraordinary,

visit her cave

15:52.233 --> 15:53.466
Who are these men?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.368
The Knights Rosula,

15:55.402 --> 15:56.902
a clandestine order
under the charge

15:56.937 --> 15:58.371
of the archdeacon of Windsor.

15:58.405 --> 16:02.174
They believe Annora and others
like her pose a threat

16:02.209 --> 16:03.175
to the Church.

16:03.210 --> 16:04.344
That is why Robinus was here,

16:04.378 --> 16:05.745
not to examine accounts,

16:05.779 --> 16:07.880
but to start the search
for Annora.

16:09.416 --> 16:11.884
What possible threat
could a gentle, aged woman

16:11.918 --> 16:13.753
present to the Church?

16:13.787 --> 16:14.887
She has ancient documents

16:14.921 --> 16:16.522
in her possession
that cast doubt

16:16.557 --> 16:20.292
upon the Church's
most significant teachings.

16:22.563 --> 16:23.896
I find it difficult to believe

16:23.930 --> 16:26.098
that a man as pious
as Archdeacon Robinus

16:26.132 --> 16:28.968
would endanger the life
of a child.

16:29.002 --> 16:30.236
Yea.

16:30.270 --> 16:33.272
But we must meet Robinus
and his Rosula

16:33.306 --> 16:35.375
to find out if it is indeed
a harsh truth

16:35.409 --> 16:38.310
or the delusion
of a potion maker.

16:39.312 --> 16:41.781
You do not think
it is a delusion.

16:41.815 --> 16:45.418
I do not, my lady.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.987
I believe Annora to be true

16:48.021 --> 16:49.588
and deeply pious.

16:49.622 --> 16:51.623
(sighs)

16:54.560 --> 16:56.561
To post a military campaign

16:56.596 --> 16:59.398
against the Pope's
most trusted archdeacon.

16:59.432 --> 17:01.400
It cannot be the shire's men
who take on this task.

17:01.434 --> 17:04.770
That would put you
and your reign

17:04.804 --> 17:06.538
at risk.

17:06.571 --> 17:08.773
I need men who are willing
to fight under no banner

17:08.808 --> 17:10.541
but that of friendship

17:10.576 --> 17:13.612
and the faith that I lead them
to the right cause.

17:13.646 --> 17:15.747
I have that faith.

17:18.617 --> 17:21.619
And so do my friends
who are in servitude.

17:21.654 --> 17:24.623
They have fought alongside
me many a time.

17:26.459 --> 17:27.826
If they take on
this dangerous task,

17:27.859 --> 17:31.463
might their sentences
be reduced?

17:31.497 --> 17:34.332
Yes, I will see to that.

17:38.137 --> 17:39.905
Thank you, Love.

17:46.478 --> 17:48.479
I will need Milus.

17:50.082 --> 17:52.050
Acquiring other skilled men.

17:53.585 --> 17:55.653
I have no secrets
from our chamberlain.

18:22.747 --> 18:25.450
I will ask but
one more time.

18:25.484 --> 18:27.852
Priest to priest,

18:27.886 --> 18:30.888
in service of your holy vow,

18:30.922 --> 18:34.191
where does the
seraphim hide?

18:34.225 --> 18:37.995
As I've told
your most pious master

18:38.029 --> 18:40.931
more times
than I can recall,

18:40.966 --> 18:44.869
this cave is the only place

18:44.903 --> 18:47.237
I ever met the healer

18:47.271 --> 18:49.573
and the scarred Templar.

19:00.418 --> 19:02.553
(growls)
Taking the life of a child,

19:02.587 --> 19:04.522
is that in service
of your vows?

19:04.556 --> 19:06.123
He will be martyred

19:06.157 --> 19:08.392
if it forces the truth
that gives us what we need.

19:12.363 --> 19:13.230
Cut the boy's throat.

19:13.264 --> 19:14.331
No!

19:14.365 --> 19:16.534
They hide at Heaven's Eye,

19:16.568 --> 19:19.301
in the thick briars
of the hillsides.

19:20.370 --> 19:21.938
How do you know this, boy?

19:21.972 --> 19:23.506
My father, sir.

19:23.541 --> 19:25.708
He buys remedies
from the gray woman.

19:25.743 --> 19:27.544
I've traveled
with him many times.

19:29.547 --> 19:31.848
Search the briars.

19:31.882 --> 19:33.149
I want them alive.

19:34.451 --> 19:35.919
(grunts)

20:15.571 --> 20:17.873
What favor will you
demand of me, Moor?

20:17.907 --> 20:19.841
Keeping my secret.

20:19.876 --> 20:21.543
A vigil watch as I pray.

20:21.577 --> 20:23.912
What is the price?

20:32.021 --> 20:34.822
(drawer opening)

20:46.100 --> 20:48.168
A Koran.

20:48.202 --> 20:50.103
Now you know my secret.

20:50.138 --> 20:54.274
So there is no price
I can demand.

20:54.309 --> 20:57.511
We are bound in heresy.

20:57.546 --> 21:01.148
Faiths that have only
known discord

21:01.182 --> 21:03.517
now serve each other.

21:03.552 --> 21:05.185
An unlikely turn
in history.

21:05.219 --> 21:06.353
(chuckles)

21:07.556 --> 21:10.690
What of your history, Aiden?

21:10.724 --> 21:12.525
(drawer closing)

21:12.560 --> 21:16.395
What crime brought 20 years

21:16.430 --> 21:19.098
of slavery to the quill?

21:19.132 --> 21:22.768
I was the scribe here,
a freeman,

21:22.802 --> 21:24.736
the baron's first
year of rule.

21:24.771 --> 21:26.905
This young

21:26.940 --> 21:30.843
Teutonic Knight
would not cease taunting me.

21:30.877 --> 21:34.780
Mocking my Jew face.

21:34.814 --> 21:38.550
Every day, I let that hatred
pass through me

21:38.585 --> 21:41.019
like a familiar wind.

21:41.053 --> 21:44.957
The wind that leaves
the burn of madness.

21:46.659 --> 21:48.560
I pierced him

21:48.595 --> 21:50.963
four times with my dagger.

21:53.265 --> 21:54.766
He lived.

21:54.801 --> 21:56.668
I was tortured,

21:56.703 --> 21:58.236
hung from high chains

21:58.270 --> 22:00.706
for six months.

22:00.740 --> 22:01.940
Then...

22:01.975 --> 22:04.676
sent back to my stacks

22:04.711 --> 22:06.211
to die.

22:06.245 --> 22:09.415
Four stabs to the knight...

22:09.816 --> 22:11.416
In his back?

22:11.450 --> 22:12.684
No.

22:12.719 --> 22:15.353
Dagger to dagger.

22:15.388 --> 22:17.855
Face to face.

22:17.890 --> 22:19.790
I was raised

22:19.825 --> 22:21.126
in a dirt hole, good Moor,

22:21.160 --> 22:24.629
by a pack of devout

22:24.663 --> 22:26.664
and angry Turkish wolves.

22:28.267 --> 22:31.169
Torah and survival.

22:31.203 --> 22:34.906
Some of the skills
I acquired serve me.

22:34.940 --> 22:38.510
Others bring only pain.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.315
Your manner

22:44.350 --> 22:46.617
and poise,

22:46.652 --> 22:48.619
you come from no dirt hole.

22:48.654 --> 22:50.655
Nobility?

22:50.689 --> 22:52.890
Scholars.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.627
Gentle and decent.

22:56.662 --> 22:59.664
They taught me to think freely,

22:59.698 --> 23:01.732
to question.

23:01.767 --> 23:04.835
To push for truth.

23:04.870 --> 23:07.338
A skill that served me

23:07.373 --> 23:10.774
until the conquest.

23:10.808 --> 23:13.077
Then brought pain.

23:13.111 --> 23:14.911
Exiled?

23:14.946 --> 23:17.214
Escaped.

23:18.616 --> 23:21.418
My wife and daughter
with her father,

23:21.453 --> 23:24.854
made it out through
the Andorran trade routes.

23:26.023 --> 23:28.525
My brother and I...

23:28.560 --> 23:30.594
found false passage

23:30.628 --> 23:33.063
on a labor ship.

23:33.098 --> 23:36.066
Our final port...

23:36.101 --> 23:38.668
Paradise.

23:40.671 --> 23:42.306
(sighs)

23:42.340 --> 23:45.075
This is a great risk
you propose, Baroness,

23:45.110 --> 23:47.811
inspired by the tale
of a strange woman

23:47.845 --> 23:49.213
you hardly know.

23:49.247 --> 23:50.847
A risk taken to
save the lives

23:50.881 --> 23:52.816
of our priest and a child.

23:52.850 --> 23:55.252
I have reason to believe
her story is true.

23:55.286 --> 23:57.721
Our punisher would be
that reason.

23:58.723 --> 24:00.690
Yes.

24:00.725 --> 24:03.727
The man we both know
as Wilkin Brattle.

24:09.433 --> 24:13.369
I see your bond has grown
to inspire truth.

24:13.403 --> 24:14.804
A truth you have known

24:14.839 --> 24:17.707
from the moment
he stepped through our gates.

24:20.845 --> 24:22.478
Your ability
to turn complications

24:22.513 --> 24:24.681
into advantages
is what makes you

24:24.715 --> 24:26.783
such a valuable chamberlain.

24:27.752 --> 24:30.353
Was that a compliment, my lady?

24:31.355 --> 24:33.356
I believe it was.

24:42.767 --> 24:44.734
(sighs)

24:47.671 --> 24:48.804
I will provide the men

24:48.838 --> 24:50.539
to take back the priest
and the boy.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.975
The only thing
that I ask in return

24:53.009 --> 24:55.010
is that you give
heartfelt consideration

24:55.045 --> 24:57.245
to Baron Pryce.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.049
That my lady
stays open

25:00.083 --> 25:04.086
to the prospect of a marriage
that will protect our shire.

25:08.091 --> 25:11.093
I will stay open to
all... prospects.

25:15.832 --> 25:17.666
Thank you, Baroness.

25:21.738 --> 25:24.073
Despite your
aggressive, secretive

25:24.107 --> 25:26.474
and often
illicit tactics,

25:26.509 --> 25:29.678
I am quite fond of you, Milus.

25:32.448 --> 25:35.017
I believe you
left out "godless."

25:38.253 --> 25:41.655
I'm fond of you as well,
dear Love.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.935
Why am I still
confined, maiden?

25:53.969 --> 25:56.104
Lady Love needs
to be certain

25:56.138 --> 25:58.906
that no one has heard
of your attack on her.

25:58.941 --> 26:01.475
Word of such things can
spread like a dry fire.

26:01.509 --> 26:03.945
You will be free as soon as
she confirms its secrecy.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.313
She promised I could see my boy.

26:06.348 --> 26:08.916
Luca must be deep with worry
about his mother.

26:08.951 --> 26:10.317
And you shall see him,

26:10.352 --> 26:11.919
as soon as he returns
from his hunting venture.

26:11.954 --> 26:13.487
Hunting?

26:13.521 --> 26:17.458
The baroness said the priest
took him fishing.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.493
Yes.

26:19.527 --> 26:21.094
Hunting for fish.

26:21.129 --> 26:22.663
Big fish.

26:22.697 --> 26:26.367
That need to be ripped from
the stream by pike and hook,

26:26.401 --> 26:27.801
then wrestled to the ground.

26:27.835 --> 26:30.638
Time well spent
for a boy.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.111
(door opens, closes)

26:38.146 --> 26:40.147
(baby fusses)

26:45.387 --> 26:46.953
And you have no doubt
that we will find

26:46.988 --> 26:49.723
these Rosula
at the coves?

26:49.758 --> 26:52.893
ANNORA: They will use the boy to
pull the truth from the priest.

26:52.927 --> 26:55.696
Then wait for my return
at the coves.

26:55.730 --> 26:58.531
WILKIN: We can expect
at least two legions

26:58.565 --> 27:00.700
of Rosula Knights, all skilled.

27:00.734 --> 27:02.702
And very deadly.

27:02.736 --> 27:04.805
No fear of dying.

27:04.839 --> 27:06.506
And we bring how many men
to this fight?

27:08.542 --> 27:10.877
I can recruit
a half legion or more

27:10.912 --> 27:13.713
of knights and horsemen
that will fight for pay.

27:13.747 --> 27:15.849
No concern for decree.

27:15.883 --> 27:19.719
LADY LOVE: If I am able
to find out their whereabouts,

27:19.753 --> 27:22.755
I should be able to bring some
familial help to our table.

27:23.858 --> 27:25.859
I know another
who would be willing

27:25.893 --> 27:27.894
to trade risk
for years of servitude.

27:41.908 --> 27:43.743
Luca.

27:43.777 --> 27:45.878
Son!

27:49.583 --> 27:51.016
Who are you?

27:51.051 --> 27:52.752
Where is my son?

27:52.786 --> 27:55.788
What have you done
with my boy?!

27:55.823 --> 27:56.789
Jess...

27:56.824 --> 27:58.358
Demon!

27:58.392 --> 27:59.826
Hideous demon!

28:07.100 --> 28:09.068
CORBETT: I will have
my men ready by midday.

28:09.102 --> 28:10.503
TORAN: We will be
ready as well.

28:10.537 --> 28:12.037
You cannot risk a journey
that might put you

28:12.072 --> 28:13.438
into the mouth of the Rosula.

28:13.473 --> 28:16.441
You will be safe within
the walls of our castle.

28:16.476 --> 28:18.443
Thank you.

28:18.478 --> 28:21.713
We will most certainly need the
blade of your hooded protector.

28:22.983 --> 28:23.983
(door opens)

28:29.122 --> 28:31.857
A conspiring table.

28:31.892 --> 28:34.826
Full of adulterers,
liars and witches!

28:34.861 --> 28:36.428
No, dear Jessamy.

28:36.462 --> 28:38.097
We do not conspire.

28:38.131 --> 28:39.131
(screams)

29:07.439 --> 29:09.874
We found no truth
at Heaven's Eye.

29:20.152 --> 29:22.153
I will tell you.

29:23.488 --> 29:25.489
(muffled whimpering)

29:32.930 --> 29:34.732
What will become of her?

29:34.766 --> 29:37.634
A mortal assault
on a baroness?

29:39.971 --> 29:41.938
Yea.

29:41.973 --> 29:42.973
LOCKE:
With me.

29:50.047 --> 29:52.015
Your wife spoke some
remarkable things

29:52.049 --> 29:54.117
as her mouth was being strapped.

29:54.151 --> 29:56.286
The delusion of madness.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.888
Perhaps...

29:59.290 --> 30:01.124
Wilkin.

30:06.865 --> 30:08.832
The truth.

30:08.867 --> 30:11.067
Who are you?

30:13.571 --> 30:15.506
Wilkin Brattle.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.907
Former knight
in Longshanks' army,

30:17.941 --> 30:20.710
under the high command
of Erik Ventris.

30:22.846 --> 30:24.814
Ventris?

30:24.848 --> 30:26.816
For the last five years,
I've been but a barley farmer

30:26.850 --> 30:28.384
in West River Riding.

30:30.521 --> 30:34.490
The cross... you wear
around your neck

30:34.525 --> 30:37.026
belonged to my wife.

30:37.060 --> 30:39.061
She carried
our child.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.932
Both were slain
by the man

30:42.966 --> 30:45.034
who now wears it
as a spoil of victory.

30:47.103 --> 30:49.939
I did not kill that pregnant
woman, your wife.

30:52.042 --> 30:55.578
I was ordered as such,
but I could not.

30:55.612 --> 30:57.914
Now who speaks
remarkable things?

30:57.948 --> 31:01.083
(both grunting)

31:16.732 --> 31:18.667
I wear this not as plunder
but as a reminder.

31:22.638 --> 31:25.240
God before crown.

31:26.609 --> 31:28.677
(Jessamy whimpers)

31:33.649 --> 31:35.784
PETRA:
No.

31:35.818 --> 31:37.819
No, my love.

31:41.491 --> 31:43.492
♪

32:08.117 --> 32:10.118
(breathes heavily)

32:16.158 --> 32:20.929
I found her on top of the
heap of innocent villagers.

32:20.963 --> 32:22.563
Dead.

32:24.633 --> 32:26.801
Our daughter cut
from her womb.

32:33.641 --> 32:36.643
Corbett knew his warrior
at first glance.

32:39.214 --> 32:41.215
Allowed your deception.

32:43.284 --> 32:47.687
Turned you into his...
obliging pawn.

32:49.623 --> 32:51.691
(door opens)

32:55.730 --> 32:58.899
The baroness wishes
only confinement

32:58.933 --> 33:00.734
for the wife of Maddox.

33:00.768 --> 33:02.936
Until a trial
can convene.

33:22.523 --> 33:24.524
What happened here, Reeve?

33:27.561 --> 33:30.563
Nothing you do not already know.

33:31.866 --> 33:34.267
Sire.

33:40.274 --> 33:42.275
(door clanks shut)

33:50.683 --> 33:52.651
A fire burned recently
in the hearth.

33:52.685 --> 33:54.820
Provisions and possessions that
would not have been left behind.

33:54.854 --> 33:57.122
Good, we will wait.

33:57.156 --> 33:58.657
Post scouts up and down
the shoreline.

34:01.394 --> 34:03.328
If this is but another
deception, kill the boy.

34:03.362 --> 34:04.362
Slowly.

34:05.998 --> 34:07.933
Ruskin to be witness
to the pain he caused.

34:10.536 --> 34:12.504
Then kill the heretical
priest as well.

34:12.539 --> 34:13.938
Yes, master.

34:54.181 --> 34:56.149
I hope one of those
burn for me.

34:56.184 --> 34:59.319
Are you in need of prayers,
Sir Brattle?

34:59.354 --> 35:01.154
(scoffs)

35:01.189 --> 35:02.589
From the moment
my eyes open

35:02.623 --> 35:04.358
till they close
again with sleep.

35:16.737 --> 35:18.705
Do you truly believe
the vision we shared

35:18.739 --> 35:20.707
was that of our child's birth?

35:20.741 --> 35:22.742
I do.

35:24.312 --> 35:26.113
Does that trouble you?

35:26.147 --> 35:28.115
No.

35:28.149 --> 35:31.718
It fills me
with so many feelings.

35:31.752 --> 35:33.920
None are troubling.

35:33.954 --> 35:36.489
Your arrival
at the castle.

35:36.523 --> 35:38.491
The things
that led you here...

35:38.525 --> 35:41.793
Oh, the journey had a greater
plan than the man bound to it.

35:41.828 --> 35:44.196
I feel that as well.

35:44.231 --> 35:48.501
Yet I see no clear path
for it to travel forward.

35:48.535 --> 35:51.737
The best paths are always cut
at a full gallop, my lady.

35:51.771 --> 35:54.240
Even if one gets lost
and cannot find their way home?

35:54.274 --> 35:58.277
Perhaps home was the destination

59:17.523 --> 59:19.191
in your fresh hole, maiden?

59:22.795 --> 59:25.496
Please.

59:25.531 --> 59:28.599
We've already thrown away law
and status this night.

59:28.634 --> 59:31.803
Then it depends, sir.

59:31.838 --> 59:33.571
How was the rod anointed?

59:33.605 --> 59:35.973
In size or firmness?

59:50.088 --> 59:52.623
Before Master Gawain
and Sir Brattle

59:52.658 --> 59:54.592
arrived at my court,

59:54.626 --> 59:55.993
I was an honest

59:56.027 --> 59:59.029
and most pious woman.

01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:02.266
Have I ruined you, my lady?

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.935
A part of me.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.505
The part that believed my heart

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:10.541
would never be open again.

01:00:11.977 --> 01:00:14.945
As well as other things...

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.714
to be open.

01:00:16.749 --> 01:00:20.251
Then you've ruined me as well,
my angel.

01:00:22.254 --> 01:00:24.221
(sighs)

01:00:24.256 --> 01:00:26.490
Tell me,

01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:29.559
dear man.

01:00:29.594 --> 01:00:31.595
Who am I to lay with
this night?

01:00:33.598 --> 01:00:35.332
Honored warrior,

01:00:35.367 --> 01:00:38.668
barley farmer,

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:40.938
Maddox the punisher?

01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:42.907
Which would you prefer?

01:00:47.979 --> 01:00:49.713
