WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.869
And these pictures of Earth
were taken from space?

00:03.871 --> 00:05.804
Yeah. By satellite.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.906
See that guy waving?

00:07.908 --> 00:10.309
- That's your dad.
- Really?

00:10.311 --> 00:13.112
[laughs]

00:13.114 --> 00:15.080
What's that?

00:15.082 --> 00:17.316
- Aah! Aah!
- Gotcha.

00:17.318 --> 00:21.153
It took me four years
and I finally got you.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.621
What can I say?

00:22.623 --> 00:25.024
You've learned well,
Grasshopper.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.558
Congratulations.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.660
Ha! What a maroon!

00:29.463 --> 00:31.663
Hello. Am I glad to be home?

00:32.733 --> 00:34.400
Oh, sure, if you don't mind

00:34.402 --> 00:37.169
your son's going to
inherit a dying world.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.339
What have you done now?

00:40.341 --> 00:43.042
I was just showing Brian
where the world's rainforests

00:43.044 --> 00:44.576
used to be.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.245
You know, you guys
are really doing a number

00:46.247 --> 00:47.746
on this planet.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.081
If I were you,
I wouldn't expect to

00:49.083 --> 00:51.283
get my security deposit back.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.952
Were these free?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.587
[laughs]

00:57.858 --> 00:59.825
You wish.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.394
You know, this has got me
very worried, Willie.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.431
Everything I read in the papers
is bad news.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.167
Oil spills, acid rain

01:08.169 --> 01:10.803
toxic dumping, Zsa Zsa.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.606
I know it sometimes
looks pretty grim.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.642
Oh, ha. Face it.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.644
Putting humans
in charge of the Earth

01:18.646 --> 01:21.747
is the cosmic equivalent
of letting Eddie Murphy direct.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.251
[theme music]

01:53.280 --> 01:56.482
[music continues]

02:24.778 --> 02:27.312
[instrumental music]

02:29.950 --> 02:31.717
Oh, you're up early.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.519
I had trouble sleeping.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.355
I heard something
very disturbing last night.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.893
ALF, w-when two people
love each other--

02:40.895 --> 02:42.261
Oh, relax.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.763
I wasn't listening at your door.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.733
It was something
I heard on the radio.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.701
[sighs]

02:49.703 --> 02:51.170
I suppose I don't
have to tell you

02:51.172 --> 02:52.571
what chlorofluorocarbons

02:52.573 --> 02:54.940
are doing to
the Earth's atmosphere.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.110
Although, I'd probably
have to tell Kate.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.611
You mean C.F.C.'s?

02:59.613 --> 03:02.314
those man-made chemicals
used in coolants

03:02.316 --> 03:03.882
which are responsible
for destroying

03:03.884 --> 03:05.150
the Earth's ozone layer?

03:05.152 --> 03:07.819
Those chlorofluorocarbons?

03:07.821 --> 03:08.987
Lucky guess.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.690
Now spell xylophone.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.960
We're gonna be here
for quite a while, aren't we?

03:14.962 --> 03:17.996
The guy on the radio said
this company called Sendrax

03:17.998 --> 03:21.600
is one of the nation's
largest suppliers of C.F.C.'s.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.338
And now you're sending a letter
to the station to thank them.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.708
Please, God, that's all it is.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.478
This happens to be a letter
to the head honcho of Sendrax.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.881
A letter? Good for you.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.216
Well, thank you.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.917
Anyone care to read it?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.652
It's quite, quite, quite

03:40.654 --> 03:43.255
quite, quite, quite, quite good.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.926
"Dear Sendrax,
manufacturing C.F.C.'s

03:47.928 --> 03:50.362
is a threat to the survival
of the planet.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.732
"In fact, I'll go out on a limb
and say it's wrong.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.735
Damn wrong!
So just knock it off."

03:58.239 --> 03:59.905
Very well-reasoned.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.473
And the use of the glitter pen

04:01.475 --> 04:03.775
gives it a certain
visual appeal.

04:03.777 --> 04:07.012
- Good luck.
- Don't.. Don't encourage him.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.547
Oh, Willie, it's one letter.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.182
It's the same thing
that we would do.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.883
It always starts out
harmlessly enough

04:11.885 --> 04:14.653
and then we're left there,
just left there scrambling

04:14.655 --> 04:17.556
for yet another mortgage.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.791
He feels strongly about it.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.461
And you know
he's gonna do it anyway.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.400
[instrumental music]

04:30.037 --> 04:31.270
And another thing.

04:31.272 --> 04:34.106
Besides destroying
the ozone layer

04:34.108 --> 04:39.678
C.F.C.'s also contribute to,
uh, the greenhouse effect

04:39.680 --> 04:42.481
which is heating up
the Earth's atmosphere.

04:42.483 --> 04:46.351
Now, I find this
especially troublesome because..

04:46.353 --> 04:48.720
Well, I have a lot of hair.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.757
(male #1)
'Right. Uh, thank you, Gordon.'

04:51.759 --> 04:54.259
'And remember, callers,
today's topic is'

04:54.261 --> 04:56.328
'home health care
for the elderly.'

04:56.330 --> 04:59.331
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, I'm
in favor of that, by the way.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.701
(male #1)
'Murray, I thought you were
screening these calls.'

05:05.539 --> 05:07.706
ALF, you shouldn't be
on the radio.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.743
Well, T.V. tends to
make my nose look large.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.146
You got another letter
from Sendrax.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.715
Ooh! Ooh, I'm so excited.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.317
Am I drooling?

05:18.319 --> 05:20.886
Thankfully, not yet.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.054
Ah.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.892
"Dear Mr. Shumway.
Thank you for your letter.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.695
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.698
We, too, are concerned
about the environment."

05:32.700 --> 05:35.934
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.805
Ugh. Blown off again.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.541
Maybe you should just drop it.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.943
No, I can't sit idly by

05:44.945 --> 05:48.080
and watch another planet
be destroyed.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.282
That would make me oh for three.

05:50.284 --> 05:51.783
Three?

05:51.785 --> 05:54.720
Guy has to have some secrets.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.556
I'm prepared to
send thousands of letters.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.991
Hundreds, if that's
what it takes.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.895
[instrumental music]

06:05.165 --> 06:07.299
"Dear Sendrax.

06:07.301 --> 06:10.202
"You should stop making C.F.C.'s

06:10.204 --> 06:13.004
"because as Gordon Shumway says

06:13.006 --> 06:16.408
"'There's no zone
like the ozone.'

06:18.312 --> 06:20.178
"Much love.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.183
Marvin Hamlisch."

06:29.456 --> 06:30.856
There's a notation
in my checkbook

06:30.858 --> 06:34.126
for a $300 payment
to the post office.

06:34.128 --> 06:37.796
Oh, oh, oh. And you think
I'm responsible, don't you?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.832
Because that's what the tone
of your voice implies, mister.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.436
And if you think you can just
waltz in here and accuse me of--

06:44.438 --> 06:48.206
Just admit it, ALF.
Why? Why? Why? Why?

06:48.208 --> 06:51.109
Why? Why? Why?

06:54.148 --> 06:56.214
Alright, alright.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.117
I needed to send
a thousand letters to Sendrax

06:59.119 --> 07:02.120
and I ran out of stamps
after the first six.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.823
I hope that clears up
the matter.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.327
Did it ever occur to you
that when I tape my checkbook

07:09.329 --> 07:10.796
to the underside
of my sock drawer

07:10.798 --> 07:13.265
it means I don't want
you using it?

07:13.267 --> 07:15.600
Well, I'm not a mind reader.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.504
Contrary to popular belief

07:19.506 --> 07:22.174
I do not exist
merely to bankroll you.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.176
So that's it, huh?

07:24.178 --> 07:26.711
You're cutting me off
at the knees.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.346
Consider yourself lucky.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.615
Kate suggested a foot higher.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.085
Eh. She'd have to
catch me first.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.990
I knew it. I knew
this was gonna end badly.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.659
Why are you always

07:40.661 --> 07:42.994
doing these things
without asking me?

07:42.996 --> 07:47.466
Why are you always
testing my l...limits?

07:47.468 --> 07:50.936
Why is this letter
signed "Marvin Hamlisch"?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.773
Are they all signed
"Marvin Hamlisch"?

07:54.775 --> 07:58.176
No, that would be stupid.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.579
Every letter
has a different name.

08:00.581 --> 08:04.216
But all of them
quote me on the radio.

08:04.218 --> 08:05.884
See, that way Sendrax will think

08:05.886 --> 08:08.820
I've created
a groundswell of support.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.356
Shockingly clever, isn't it?

08:11.358 --> 08:12.524
[telephone rings]

08:12.526 --> 08:15.160
If that's Barry Manilow,
I'm not home.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.100
Hello.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.169
Yes. Just a moment.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.404
It's for you.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.039
I'll try to keep it short.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.275
You've been very understanding,
by the way.

08:32.446 --> 08:34.379
Hello.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.781
Yeah, this is Gordon Shumway.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.518
It's someone from Sendrax.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.053
Oh, I feel so<i> muy</i> important.

08:43.257 --> 08:46.591
Somehow, we've
got to get you into therapy.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.595
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.965
No, no, we haven't
dropped the plans

08:53.967 --> 08:57.068
to go ahead
with the consumer boycott.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.638
[whispers]
I've got them scared.

09:00.507 --> 09:01.940
A meeting?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.309
I don't think
that would be possible.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.113
A lawsuit?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.648
Uh..

09:09.650 --> 09:11.750
Would I be suing you..

09:11.752 --> 09:14.019
...or would you be suing me?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.188
I see.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.592
It's for you.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.837
[softly]
Hello.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.877
[instrumental music]

09:40.647 --> 09:42.414
ALF, you have got to think

09:42.416 --> 09:44.783
what did you say
in those letters?

09:44.785 --> 09:47.085
Well, there were so many.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.055
I don't recall
any one underlying theme.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.857
Does threat, squat and run

09:52.859 --> 09:55.293
mean anything to you?

09:55.295 --> 09:58.863
Well, maybe
one underlying theme.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.435
Oh, look at that,
it's punishment time.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.870
What did the lawyer say, dad?

10:05.872 --> 10:07.806
He said he bills
by the quarter-hour

10:07.808 --> 10:09.975
and that he generally
discourages people

10:09.977 --> 10:11.810
from antagonizing corporations

10:11.812 --> 10:14.179
that have more resources
than God.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.682
Well, may I offer

10:17.684 --> 10:20.852
a few feeble words
in my own defense?

10:23.490 --> 10:25.090
Thank you.

10:25.092 --> 10:28.026
That company
is doing bad things.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.662
And I say we pick up
their gauntlet

10:30.664 --> 10:32.731
and nail them to the wall.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.532
Right, Brian?

10:34.534 --> 10:36.835
What? I'm sorry, what?

10:37.938 --> 10:40.171
Oh, it might not be
such a bad idea

10:40.173 --> 10:42.974
to meet with Sendrax
and beg for mercy.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.311
No, in a dignified way,
of course.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.846
I never had to grovel.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.447
Should I start on my knees

10:49.449 --> 10:51.850
or should I build up to it?

10:51.852 --> 10:55.053
[instrumental music]

10:58.125 --> 11:01.192
Mr. Shumway? I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.762
I'm Steve Michaels.
It's nice to meet you.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.296
[stuttering]
As I was telling your secretary

11:05.298 --> 11:08.033
my, my real name is Tanner,
Willie Tanner.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.502
Oh, oh, well, I can see
why you changed it.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.671
Mine's Stephanovich Miglorisky

11:12.673 --> 11:15.707
but Steve Michaels is much less
ethnic, don't you think?

11:15.709 --> 11:16.908
Uh-huh.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.678
Please. Please.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.880
Well, you've created

11:21.882 --> 11:23.848
quite a stir
at the front office.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.850
[chuckles]

11:25.852 --> 11:28.219
That's why I'd like to
take this time to tell you

11:28.221 --> 11:31.890
that we at Sendrax
are very, very concerned

11:31.892 --> 11:33.892
about the environment.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.827
Of course. I'm sure you are.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.563
Definitely.
That's good enough for me.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.965
And that's why we're joining
other concerned companies

11:40.967 --> 11:42.767
to stop the production
of C.F.C.'s

11:42.769 --> 11:44.102
within the next 10 years.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.370
Oh.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.905
So you can see how

11:46.907 --> 11:48.540
mounting a campaign against us

11:48.542 --> 11:49.808
would be foolish, can't you?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.009
As foolish as our using

11:51.011 --> 11:53.311
our immense legal staff

11:53.313 --> 11:54.679
to stop you in court.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.082
Not to mention costly.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.085
Absolutely. Foolish and costly.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.454
And if you let me go..

12:02.456 --> 12:05.056
I mean, when I go

12:05.058 --> 12:07.292
I'm going to tell that
to my supporters

12:07.294 --> 12:11.529
and I know you're not gonna have
any more problems.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.964
Excellent. Excellent.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.667
Then we're in agreement.
Great. Great. Great.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.302
Hey, let me give you
some souvenirs

12:17.304 --> 12:19.070
so you can walk away
with something, huh?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.207
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Huh?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.742
- Do you have any kids?
- Yeah.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.311
Oh, yeah. I've got three kids.

12:26.313 --> 12:30.115
I.. I have two, uh,
I have two boys and, uh..

12:30.117 --> 12:31.883
- I, uh..
- Oh, well, great.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.518
They'll love this stuff.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.786
- There you go.
- Oh!

12:34.788 --> 12:36.688
Thank you very much.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.857
Well, thank you.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.893
Thank you very much.
And, and, and goodbye.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.795
Oh, it's always nice to
meet someone who cares

12:43.797 --> 12:46.131
but doesn't get
annoying about it.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.802
Uh..

12:53.540 --> 12:55.507
You know..

12:55.509 --> 12:58.643
You know what my kids would love
more than any of this?

12:58.645 --> 13:00.879
They'd really love to
have some reassurance

13:00.881 --> 13:02.614
that they're gonna be
left an environment

13:02.616 --> 13:05.650
that's not been decimated
by corporate indifference.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.918
I, I don't really think

13:06.920 --> 13:09.154
that's all that much
to ask, do you?

13:09.156 --> 13:11.589
How about a really nice
fanny pack, instead?

13:13.093 --> 13:15.160
I can't guarantee
they're gonna be left a world

13:15.162 --> 13:18.296
with any ozone layer.
or any rainforests

13:18.298 --> 13:22.133
or any living things at all
for that matter.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.335
You know, you can't just
turn around in 50 years

13:24.337 --> 13:27.205
and say, "Uh-oh.
We made a mistake."

13:27.207 --> 13:29.874
Because who's gonna
be there to hear it?

13:32.245 --> 13:35.246
I'm sorry, Mr. Michaels,
at the risk of angering

13:35.248 --> 13:38.550
your immense legal staff..

13:38.552 --> 13:40.351
...this problem
isn't gonna go away

13:40.353 --> 13:42.954
just because
you choose to ignore it.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.825
Well said.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.561
Very, very, well said.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.097
I'm sorry. I couldn't,
I couldn't contain myself.

13:53.099 --> 13:57.101
I, I admire that commitment.
That passion, you know?

13:57.103 --> 13:59.304
You're an
articulate man, Gordon.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.872
Frankly, we're
always looking for

14:00.874 --> 14:03.007
just that kind of people
around here.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.542
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'm going.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.645
No. The-there's an opening
in public relations.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.049
Of course, the money isn't bad.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.084
I mean, 75 a year.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.352
I'm just assuming from your suit

14:14.354 --> 14:17.121
that's considerably more
than you're making.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.957
You're offering me a job?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.358
That includes
two Lakers season tickets

14:20.360 --> 14:22.327
if you don't mind
sitting courtside.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.996
Nicholson yells a lot, but he
knows a lot of fancy women.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.735
Mr. Michaels,
with all due respect..

14:30.737 --> 14:33.104
...would you expect me to
take a job with a company

14:33.106 --> 14:36.674
that's responsible
for destroying..

14:39.579 --> 14:42.380
Would that be all the home games
and the parking?

14:43.717 --> 14:46.684
You're a shrewd businessman.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.920
I just wanna be clear.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.267
I can't believe it was free.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.703
So you're considering
his offer, aren't you?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.372
[sighs]
I know they're not

15:07.374 --> 15:09.674
the most socially conscious
company in the world

15:09.676 --> 15:12.010
but even so,
it would give me a chance

15:12.012 --> 15:15.346
to try to affect
some change from inside.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.849
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, I see.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.217
You're saying that realistically

15:19.219 --> 15:20.885
what kind of change
could I affect

15:20.887 --> 15:22.854
in that position?

15:22.856 --> 15:24.122
No.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.156
So, so then you're saying

15:25.158 --> 15:26.491
it wasn't my eloquent speech

15:26.493 --> 15:30.061
it was just their way
of buying me off?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.263
Willie, listen to me.
I'm not saying anything.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.666
Kate, will you get off his back?

15:36.403 --> 15:38.469
You think I'm fooling myself,
don't you?

15:38.471 --> 15:41.172
You think that not only would I
not be doing the right thing

15:41.174 --> 15:43.474
but that I'm selling out
everything I believe in

15:43.476 --> 15:47.478
for $75,000, and a chance
to meet Jack Nicholson.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.448
Would you take the job, Willie?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.084
Then you could hire me
as your assistant.

15:53.086 --> 15:57.989
Together we can
destroy the company from within.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.657
ALF, please.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.926
It's not without precedent.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.262
Look at C.B.S.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.830
Dad, if there's
any chance at all

16:05.832 --> 16:08.132
that you can use your position
to make a difference

16:08.134 --> 16:10.268
from inside the company,
don't you think

16:10.270 --> 16:11.903
you owe it to yourself to try?

16:11.905 --> 16:14.706
I mean, really try?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.474
- What do you think, Kate?
- No, Willie.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.810
- No--
- No, this is your decision.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.712
Well, what do you really think?

16:20.714 --> 16:24.782
Well, I...I was
thinking about Earth Day.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.284
Oh.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.486
- Yeah. 1970.
- 'Yeah.'

16:28.488 --> 16:30.488
We organized that sit-in
against that company

16:30.490 --> 16:32.390
that was polluting
the bay, remember?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.925
And they had just
shampooed the carpets

16:33.927 --> 16:35.093
we all got these terrible rashes

16:35.095 --> 16:36.127
and had to spend the night

16:36.129 --> 16:38.229
at the free clinic.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.098
It was quite a sight.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.201
Three hundred people
from every walk of life

16:43.203 --> 16:45.636
chanting and scratching.

Who am I kidding?
I'm not taking that job.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.277
Oh, but I'm telling you, Willie

16:53.279 --> 16:56.814
we can crush that company
in five days.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.584
Three, if we work nights.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.620
ALF, we'll beat them
some other way.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.089
Trust me.

17:05.091 --> 17:07.925
Alright, alright.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.961
It'll do me good anyway
to tell Michaels

17:09.963 --> 17:12.663
what he can do with his job.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.566
Well, this time
when you tell him off

a tanning bed at 5:30.

and I don't wanna look like

17:41.795 --> 17:43.928

out there.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.163
Okay.

17:45.165 --> 17:49.000
Hey, Willie.
How's it going, bub?

17:49.002 --> 17:50.635
Mr. Michaels.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.639
If you were doing something
that was bad for you

17:54.641 --> 17:57.842
and somebody pointed it
out to you that it was

17:57.844 --> 18:00.912
would it take you 10 years
to stop doing it?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.480
Ah, well, before you go on

18:02.482 --> 18:04.715
I think I should tell you
you're talking to the wrong man.

18:04.717 --> 18:08.252
I'm not gonna be shoved off
on somebody else.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.521
Did you know that
if you took the ozone layer

18:10.523 --> 18:12.356
and laid it on the ground,
it would only be

18:12.358 --> 18:14.025
about as thick
as a piece of canvas?

18:14.027 --> 18:19.063
And holes larger than Antarctica
have already been found in it.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.498
And phytoplankton

18:20.500 --> 18:23.634
that's the ocean's
first step in the food chain

18:23.636 --> 18:26.437

by just a 10 percent increase

the end of the planet!

18:37.550 --> 18:40.184
Again, brilliantly spoken.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.020
However, as I tried to
tell you earlier

18:43.022 --> 18:44.555
I'm leaving.

is bringing in fresh meat.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.765

18:54.767 --> 18:56.634
Well, uh, how about
these paper clips?

18:56.636 --> 18:59.570
- No, no. No, thanks.
- Oh, I insist. Take them.

in this corporate game

19:18.525 --> 19:21.626
that you've lost sight
of what matters?

had turned over a new leaf

a little harder for them.

I was right for it

are more prone to head injuries?

22:12.398 --> 22:15.066
Oh, ha! I can top that one.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.001
Did you know that
if everyone recycled

22:17.003 --> 22:19.637
just one-tenth
of their newspaper

22:19.639 --> 22:23.107
we could save about
25 million trees every year.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.345
Willie, would you get me
the meat mallet?

22:27.347 --> 22:28.746
It's a good book, Kate.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.949
It's got things in it
that everyone can do.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.851
Hey, did you know that
if every family

22:33.853 --> 22:35.553
planted one tree,
we could replenish--

22:35.555 --> 22:37.755
It's in the top drawer.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.925
Look, we're recycling.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.927
We're gonna boycott tuna,
we're writing letters

22:42.929 --> 22:46.764
about the rainforest,
and you are driving me crazy.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.900
But did you write those letters
on recycled paper?

22:51.237 --> 22:52.503
That's it. That's it.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.872
I give up. I give up!

22:54.874 --> 22:57.475
Luckily, she's got me here
to remind her.

22:58.845 --> 23:03.714
Oh, hey, Willie, did you know
that if we recycle aluminum cans

23:03.716 --> 23:05.950
we can cut related air pollution

23:05.952 --> 23:08.452
by 95 percent?

23:10.189 --> 23:11.522
Willie?

23:13.059 --> 23:16.060
