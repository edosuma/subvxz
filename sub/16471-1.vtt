[Tiesto] <i>You can't compare Steve</i>
<i>to any other DJs.</i>

00:31.698 --> 00:33.575
He has his own role in the DJ world.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.746
He's one of the first entertainers

00:37.829 --> 00:40.499
that took DJing to a different spot.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.510
I think Steve is like a force of nature.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.595
<i>That's what made him stand out,</i>

00:53.679 --> 00:55.472
<i>he's a larger-than-life character.</i>

01:01.812 --> 01:04.940
[Diplo] <i>Dance music doesn't really</i>
<i>have a personality.</i>

01:05.649 --> 01:08.860
Steve has an overabundance of personality.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.130
[Travis] <i>It's very much elements</i>
<i>of punk rock shows.</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:34.428
But he's flipped them
and made them his own.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.147
[Diplo]
<i>If you don't know Steve personally,</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:47.107
you're gonna have
a perception of him right away.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.995
I don't know how he can be in a rowboat
in the middle of a crowd and be a DJ.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.834
[crowd cheering wildly]

02:12.591 --> 02:15.927
If you're doing something
that people are afraid of or against,

02:16.011 --> 02:18.055
I think you're doing something right.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.653
That's what EDM is now,
it's more of a big spectacle show.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.123
One... two... three!

02:52.297 --> 02:54.383
[Pete] <i>Everybody asks the question,</i>

02:54.758 --> 02:57.719
<i>"Where is it going?"</i>
<i>And I think the evolution of the scene</i>

02:57.803 --> 03:01.390
<i>will be more about characters</i>
<i>and personalities.</i>

03:02.307 --> 03:04.226
Steve was always more than a DJ.

03:09.439 --> 03:13.402
[Tiernan] <i>I forgot that</i>
<i>your mom moved here without your dad.</i>

03:13.860 --> 03:16.154
<i>How often would you see him in the year?</i>

03:16.238 --> 03:20.075
[Steve] <i>We'd do two trips,</i>
<i>usually like summer and winter time.</i>

03:20.158 --> 03:22.536
I would always look forward to it.
I'd just wait to see him again

03:22.619 --> 03:25.622
and look forward to these trips.
I used to skate right there.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.962
<i>Growing up, my brother and sister</i>
<i>already were in college.</i>

03:32.504 --> 03:35.173
<i>So from eight on,</i>
<i>it was like my mom raising me.</i>

03:35.674 --> 03:38.385
<i>You know, I'd see my dad whenever I could.</i>

03:41.138 --> 03:43.265
My father divorced my mother

03:43.724 --> 03:45.851
<i>when Steven was very young.</i>

03:47.728 --> 03:49.938
<i>So my mother really raised us...</i>

03:50.021 --> 03:51.481
<i>in the Japanese culture...</i>

03:51.565 --> 03:52.858
<i>in American setting.</i>

03:56.528 --> 04:00.824
[in Japanese]
He didn't have any Japanese friends.

04:01.867 --> 04:05.036
[Dan] <i>He was stuck</i>
<i>in this whitewashed world.</i>

04:05.120 --> 04:06.747
<i>He didn't have...</i>

04:06.830 --> 04:09.541
Asian peers of his own
that he could connect with.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.004
[Steve] When I grew up, I was like,

04:14.087 --> 04:16.380
-"Which clique can I be a part of?"
-Yeah.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.841
And I tried a bunch.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.138
<i>Freshman year, I was trying</i>
<i>to find something I could be a part of.</i>

04:23.221 --> 04:26.016
-[Tiernan] <i>Yeah.</i>
-<i>So I joined the football team.</i>

04:28.143 --> 04:31.980
<i>But they were all jocks and big</i>
<i>and I was only, like, 100 pounds.</i>

04:32.564 --> 04:35.734
-Never let me play, no matter--
-Why did they bring you on the team?

04:35.817 --> 04:38.528
Because they have to,
it's like affirmative action.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.823
They have to let everyone have a chance.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.535
I tried other sports,
none of them worked out.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.329
They were always big fails.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.041
[Tiernan] <i>Did you get teased</i>
<i>or picked on a lot?</i>

04:51.124 --> 04:53.043
[Steve] <i>The only real fight I had</i>

04:53.126 --> 04:55.879
<i>was playing badminton,</i>
<i>I was a badminton player,</i>

04:55.962 --> 04:58.048
<i>and there was this one fucking asshole.</i>

04:58.131 --> 05:01.051
<i>He's just saying just a tirade</i>
<i>of racial slurs.</i>

05:01.760 --> 05:03.553
"Hey you, fuckin' Nip!

05:03.637 --> 05:06.056
You fucking gook, you slant eye.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.767
Yeah! You think you're gonna fucking win?"

05:08.850 --> 05:11.770
-So blatant, he was like out of a movie.
-Yeah.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.357
All his friends were laughing behind him.
I couldn't believe it,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.442
and I was sitting there
and kept looking back,

05:17.526 --> 05:20.278
getting, like, so angry, so angry.

05:20.362 --> 05:24.241
Just so angry that his friends
are laughing and they're allowing this.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.410
And no one's doing shit, man.
No one's doing shit.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.334
[Steve] <i>You know, especially</i>
<i>when you're a kid growing up</i>

05:34.417 --> 05:36.127
and you're the benchwarmer,

05:36.419 --> 05:40.507
and you're the kid
that has a hard time making friends,

05:41.299 --> 05:45.220
you definitely don't think you're gonna be
someone of any influence at all.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.641
<i>I wanted to be a popular kid.</i>

05:49.724 --> 05:53.019
<i>I wanted everyone to like me.</i>
<i>I wanted to fit in.</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:58.942
[Chizuru, in Japanese]
<i>Steven never said anything to me...</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:02.028
but he really missed his father.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.913
[Tiernan] <i>I think he's always gonna be</i>
<i>trying to prove himself to his father.</i>

06:11.997 --> 06:14.040
As much as he may not want to admit it,

06:14.124 --> 06:15.875
I think Rocky is the main driving force

06:15.959 --> 06:18.086
behind all of his
passion projects in life.

06:19.629 --> 06:25.343
<i>He had such a major influence,</i>
<i>or lack thereof, in Steve's life,</i>

06:25.427 --> 06:28.054
which drove Steve to want to strive

06:28.138 --> 06:32.475
to be something greater
than any other human being wants to be.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.498
[woman] <i>Without further ado,</i>
<i>I'd like to introduce Steve Aoki.</i>

06:55.582 --> 06:57.500
[crowd cheering]

07:01.504 --> 07:04.382
[Steve] <i>When I think of playing here,</i>
<i>I think about...</i>

07:04.466 --> 07:08.428
<i>this long journey </i>
<i>from when I first started playing music.</i>

07:09.262 --> 07:13.350
<i>Going from small clubs,</i>
<i>to bigger venues, to festivals.</i>

07:14.059 --> 07:18.146
<i>And now to the point where,</i>
<i>as an artist, as an electronic artist,</i>

07:19.147 --> 07:24.277
<i>actually playing at Madison Square Garden</i>
<i>is one of those rare moments.</i>

07:24.819 --> 07:28.531
<i>And I'm just completely humbled by it.</i>

07:30.951 --> 07:32.327
<i>And with that,</i>

07:33.036 --> 07:36.414
<i>I'm proud to announce that I'm gonna</i>
<i>be releasing my two-part album,</i>

07:36.498 --> 07:40.752
<i>"Neon Future," something I've been</i>
<i>working on for over two years now.</i>

07:40.835 --> 07:43.880
<i>New York also is a very special place</i>
<i>for me. It's...</i>

07:44.297 --> 07:46.466
<i>My dad lived here all my life.</i>

07:46.925 --> 07:50.261
<i>So I have a very big heart</i>
<i>for New York City.</i>

07:50.345 --> 07:53.932
<i>And I know how proud he would be</i>
<i>if he was here...</i>

07:54.599 --> 07:57.727
<i>that his son is fuckin' playing</i>
<i>Madison Square Garden.</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:00.271
[sighs] <i>It's fuckin'...</i>

08:00.355 --> 08:04.818
[cheers and applause]

08:09.406 --> 08:11.700
<i>It's fucking crazy, man. I just can't...</i>

08:15.203 --> 08:16.621
<i>Fuck.</i>

08:19.040 --> 08:20.834
-[exhales]
-[indistinct mumbling]

08:21.251 --> 08:24.254
-Yeah!
-[crowd cheering]

08:29.342 --> 08:33.596
<i>Growing up, it was always,</i>
<i>"How do I impress my father?"</i>

08:35.056 --> 08:38.559
<i>How can I show him</i>
<i>I'm gonna be successful?</i>

08:40.645 --> 08:42.522
[Devon] <i>He idolized our father,</i>

08:42.605 --> 08:47.736
as did, you know,
all of my brothers and sisters.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.532
[Steve] <i>He'd always push his kids</i>
<i>to work harder.</i>

08:54.284 --> 08:57.287
<i>There was never a break,</i>
<i>we could never have a break.</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:02.083
<i>He never did help me out.</i>

09:04.627 --> 09:06.046
<i>It's very Japanese.</i>

09:06.671 --> 09:09.632
<i>That kind of drive and ambition</i>
<i>and work ethic.</i>

09:12.761 --> 09:17.432
[Chizuru, in Japanese]
<i>Steven's father had a very big heart.</i>

09:19.392 --> 09:23.146
<i>But he could be selfish too.</i>

09:25.398 --> 09:27.442
He would be so focused
on what he wanted to achieve...

09:28.234 --> 09:31.488
<i>he would forget about his family.</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:42.040
[man] <i>They call him Rocky Aoki.</i>

09:42.123 --> 09:45.168
<i>-Rocky Aoki.</i>
<i>-</i> [multiple voices] <i>Rocky Aoki.</i>

09:45.251 --> 09:47.170
<i>We want Rocky!</i>

09:48.963 --> 09:52.884
Our father first came to the US as
a wrestler on the Japanese Olympic team.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.930
<i>When he was in New York,</i>
<i>he defected from the group</i>

09:57.013 --> 09:59.140
<i>and ended up staying in the city.</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:02.811
<i>With the money he saved </i>
<i>from being an ice cream man in Harlem,</i>

10:02.894 --> 10:05.772
he opened his first Benihana in New York.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.317
<i>I'm Rocky Aoki.</i>

10:09.400 --> 10:11.319
<i>When I came to this country</i>
<i>nine years ago,</i>

10:11.402 --> 10:12.654
<i>I had a dream.</i>

10:12.737 --> 10:15.448
<i>I introduced Hibachi cuisine to America.</i>

10:15.532 --> 10:16.616
<i>The people loved it.</i>

10:16.699 --> 10:19.494
<i>Today Benihanas are everywhere.</i>

10:19.577 --> 10:21.204
<i>If you haven't eaten at the Benihana,</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:23.998
<i>you've missed out</i>
<i>on a great American institution.</i>

10:24.082 --> 10:25.625
[Steve] <i>He was a genius with marketing.</i>

10:26.376 --> 10:30.130
<i>He brought over chefs from Japan</i>
<i>and had them cook right at the table.</i>

10:30.213 --> 10:34.050
<i>He injected entertainment and showmanship</i>
<i>into Japanese cuisine.</i>

10:35.135 --> 10:36.261
[gasping in awe]

10:37.470 --> 10:40.849
His work ethic was unparalleled
to anyone I've met in my life.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.312
[Rocky] <i>I don't have to sleep.</i>
<i>I sleep four hours a day.</i>

10:46.396 --> 10:48.273
<i>I work 16 to 17 hours a day.</i>

10:48.356 --> 10:50.066
Very nice, very nice.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.860
[Steve] <i>It seemed like he knew everyone.</i>

10:51.943 --> 10:53.444
<i>Hanging out with Muhammad Ali,</i>

10:53.528 --> 10:57.657
<i>John Lennon, you know,</i>
<i>all these influential people.</i>

10:57.740 --> 10:59.325
He was right in the middle of it.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.578
<i>Rocky, how you doing?</i>

11:01.661 --> 11:05.456
[Steve] <i>Everything he did</i>
<i>was always focused on one thing,</i>

11:06.332 --> 11:07.625
<i>Benihana.</i>

11:09.294 --> 11:12.046
Besides being a restaurateur,
he was a sportsman.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.967
He was a daredevil.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.016
The guy was fucking crazy like that.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.352
<i>He broke a world record</i>
<i>for hot-air ballooning.</i>

11:26.436 --> 11:28.688
He didn't know what the fuck
he was doing, he just did it.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.149
[Rocky] <i>I'm not afraid of dying.</i>

11:31.232 --> 11:32.358
<i>I don't give a damn.</i>

11:32.442 --> 11:33.985
<i>I'm gonna live forever.</i>

11:34.777 --> 11:35.862
[man] <i>Whoa!</i>

11:35.945 --> 11:37.030
[Steve] <i>I'm not as crazy,</i>

11:37.488 --> 11:39.407
'cause he really was fucking nuts.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.992
<i>Aoki was thrown into the water--</i>

11:41.075 --> 11:43.578
[woman] <i>His speedboat flipped over</i>
<i>in San Francisco Bay--</i>

11:43.661 --> 11:45.747
[man] <i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>It looks like the boat may go--</i>

11:45.830 --> 11:47.582
[woman 2] <i>He's nearly been killed</i>
<i>on several occasions--</i>

11:47.665 --> 11:49.417
[woman 3] <i>While lying in a hospital bed,</i>

11:49.500 --> 11:51.836
<i>Aoki said he plans to push ahead</i>

11:51.920 --> 11:54.797
<i>with his quest to become</i>
<i>the fastest man on water.</i>

11:56.841 --> 11:58.635
[Dan] <i>His dad was almost like...</i>

11:58.718 --> 12:00.386
a superhero to Steve.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.098
<i>That's probably a huge inspiration</i>
<i>to look up to.</i>

12:04.182 --> 12:09.437
This dad that I don't really know too well
but here he is, just crushing it. [laughs]

12:10.313 --> 12:13.399
[Steve] <i>He had balls bigger</i>
<i>than anyone I've ever seen.</i>

12:15.860 --> 12:18.821
I'm so proud that's my father
who did those things.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.464
[Steve] I had a lot of these photos.

12:36.547 --> 12:40.093
These are like his early years.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.470
Look at his mustaches.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.681
[woman] You have that too, now.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.766
[laughing]

12:47.809 --> 12:51.312
[in Japanese] Do you have
any interesting memories of our father?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.691
I remember the first time
we went in the balloon,

12:54.774 --> 12:57.235
we got caught in a tree and fell.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.155
Six months later,
we were ready to try again.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.992
That's when we flew to San Francisco.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.121
[Kevin] That was the second attempt
to cross the Pacific.

13:09.247 --> 13:13.209
[in Japanese] Did you believe
that Rocky would make it to the US?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.294
[Kojima] To the US?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.464
I thought he would make it.

13:20.591 --> 13:27.140
He said that Mt. Fuji looked
very beautiful during his flight.

13:27.223 --> 13:32.020
Before they got to San Francisco,
the balloon went up too high.

13:32.103 --> 13:38.026
So the balloon froze
and it started descending.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.446
It descended almost
to the ocean's surface.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.783
So they dropped their cameras
and all their belongings...

13:47.368 --> 13:50.204
<i>and the balloon finally</i>
<i>started rising again...</i>

13:50.955 --> 13:53.291
<i>and they made it to North America.</i>

13:53.541 --> 13:54.542
[Steve, in English] <i>Wow.</i>

13:55.126 --> 13:58.087
[Chizuru] <i>He was around 35 years old.</i>

13:58.171 --> 13:59.672
-Like my age.
-Yeah, your age.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.133
Doing all these things, it's insane.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.219
[Kojima, in Japanese] <i>Nobody in Japan</i>
<i>was doing stuff like that back then.</i>

14:05.303 --> 14:08.473
Now Steven is like Rocky.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.351
He's just jumping and I worry about him.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.438
I don't want to be like second Rocky,
you know?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.483
So, I said, "Wow! Another Rocky."

14:20.526 --> 14:24.906
[Steve] <i>It was incredible,</i>
<i>what was happening with just one person.</i>

14:25.448 --> 14:28.159
<i>It makes sense that he did Benihana.</i>

14:28.326 --> 14:31.746
<i>He was trying to create a show</i>
<i>for the American audience,</i>

14:31.829 --> 14:34.957
<i>not just at the restaurant,</i>
<i>but in his own personal life.</i>

14:37.293 --> 14:38.878
<i>He was a showman.</i>

14:55.144 --> 14:59.732
[alarm beeping]

15:01.943 --> 15:05.738
[beeping gets louder]

15:10.910 --> 15:13.913
[Matt] <i>I've been Steve's manager</i>
<i>for over ten years.</i>

15:15.540 --> 15:18.626
<i>I've never seen anyone</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:22.505
<i>I remember a couple years into it,</i>

15:22.588 --> 15:24.298
people would tell me
I need to get him to slow down,

15:24.382 --> 15:28.219
'cause he can't keep at this pace
and he'll burn out in a year or two.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.347
Here we are, eight, nine years later,
he's only picked up steam.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.439
[Steve] <i>No one asked me about that.</i>

15:39.522 --> 15:42.692
Dillon's shaking his head.
He said there was no miscommunication.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.527
-He's in front of me.
-[Dillon] It's on Google Docs.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.320
It's on Google Docs, he says.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.823
If we can be efficient with the time,

15:48.906 --> 15:50.783
then let's be efficient with the time.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.368
And Matt, you should know that.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.413
You know how we are with LA time.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.960
Yeah, but you're fucking manager,
you need to deal with this shit.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.962
Don't fucking throw it off your hands

16:03.045 --> 16:05.631
and say, "I don't know
what the fuck's going on."

16:06.883 --> 16:08.968
[Matt] <i>This morning we had</i>
<i>an argument with Steve.</i>

16:09.093 --> 16:11.846
He's upset that he flew
from Sweden to Vegas yesterday.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.265
He had a three o'clock set.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.351
<i>Then he had an interview for PBS.</i>

16:17.477 --> 16:18.811
-[man] Wedding cake?
-[Steve] Yeah.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.481
Then he had a set at Hakkasan in Vegas.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.983
<i>He finishes at, like, 4:30.</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:25.985
Got a 6:00 a.m. lobby call.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.278
[Steve] Barely surviving.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.863
<i>Flies to LA, lands at 9:30.</i>

16:28.946 --> 16:31.949
<i>At 11:30, he has to be</i>
<i>at a music video shoot.</i>

16:32.033 --> 16:33.326

16:33.409 --> 16:35.495
<i>-It's a ten-hour shoot.</i>
-[man] Cut!

16:35.578 --> 16:37.580
Then he has a studio session
with Will.i.am.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.833
Tomorrow he's got radio at eight
in the morning.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.294
Steve Aoki, welcome back
to the neighborhood.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.879
<i>Interviews all day long.</i>

16:44.962 --> 16:46.047
One... two... three!

16:46.130 --> 16:48.925
Then he has a flight at six o'clock
back to Ibiza.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.301
-[engine sounding]
-Whoo!

16:50.843 --> 16:53.137
The argument today? He's like,

16:53.221 --> 16:54.680
"When do I sleep?"

17:04.648 --> 17:08.277
[Steve] <i>Last year,</i>
<i>I cracked over 300 shows</i>

17:08.361 --> 17:09.694

17:14.075 --> 17:16.493
[Gary] <i>I've never seen anyone play...</i>

17:16.577 --> 17:18.412
as many shows as that guy fucking plays.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.999
His work ethic is amazing.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.294
Oh, Steve is a machine.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.924
He's the quintessential grind of DJs.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.928
[Matt] Guinness Book of World Records

17:34.011 --> 17:38.516

17:41.602 --> 17:43.521
[Afrojack] <i>Steve works too hard.</i>

17:43.604 --> 17:46.232
<i>Like, right now, Steve,</i>
<i>I'm telling you right now...</i>

17:46.315 --> 17:47.733
Relax.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.451
[Tiernan] <i>He's so driven</i>
<i>and he's so passionate about his work</i>

17:57.535 --> 18:00.830

to have a bit of a personal life.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.337
[crowd cheering wildly]

18:08.421 --> 18:10.172
Every opportunity he had, he took it.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.008
To do that many shows,
you have to play everywhere.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.594
-<i>We are in Europe.</i>
-<i>We made it to Torreón, Mexico.</i>

18:14.677 --> 18:15.678
<i>Traveling around the world.</i>

18:15.761 --> 18:18.139
<i>Came all the way to Beijing</i>
<i>to have this duck.</i>

18:18.222 --> 18:19.807
[Diplo] <i> Steve was the first guy to go,</i>

18:19.890 --> 18:22.351
<i>"I'm gonna go to Vietnam,</i>
<i>everywhere in Asia</i>

18:22.435 --> 18:24.520

make my name bigger there."

18:25.563 --> 18:28.107
<i>He was the first guy I remember</i>
<i>that went to Kuala Lumpur.</i>

18:29.025 --> 18:30.776
He was just going there to like...

18:30.860 --> 18:32.903
<i>put his flag down.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:36.198
<i>By doing that for three or four years,</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:38.075
we've become able to tour all the time.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.580
We got three shows on that day.
Three shows on this day.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.874
This day here,
we have to drive a bit anyway.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.045
That walkway just turns
into a really nice bed <i> </i> for the world tour.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.468
<i>He's like a prophet</i>
<i>that actually wants to go out</i>

18:55.551 --> 18:57.637
and go to as many cities as possible

18:57.720 --> 18:59.889
and have as many people
see him as possible.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.309
Every year he's magnifying
what he was doing.

19:03.392 --> 19:07.188
<i>I wish I had done that because</i>
<i>he was putting his name out there.</i>

19:09.023 --> 19:12.777
[Steve] <i>I am addicted to that feeling</i>
<i>of being on the road</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:15.988
and having that connection
with all these fans.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.745
[Tiernan] <i>His fans are everything to him.</i>

19:23.913 --> 19:26.207
<i>I don't think he would ever</i>
<i>say no to someone.</i>

19:26.290 --> 19:27.541
[woman] I'm gonna cry.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.211
Without that energy,
I don't know what he would do.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.926
Steve Aoki is probably the most recorded
human being on the planet.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.970
<i>He has become one of</i>
<i>the largest celebrities in the world</i>

19:40.054 --> 19:41.931

[Pete] <i>He's 24/7 Mr. Entertainment.</i>

19:45.059 --> 19:46.769
Quite an unusual guy to hang around with.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.940
<i>And if you get to mid-30s, 40 years old,</i>

19:51.023 --> 19:52.608
<i>and you're at the top of your game,</i>

19:52.692 --> 19:54.735
<i>it's dangerous to your competition</i>

19:54.819 --> 19:57.029
<i>'cause you're 24/7.</i>

19:57.113 --> 19:59.156
And it's dangerous for the artist himself.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.390
<i>I've never seen him sit still</i>
<i>for longer than maybe a couple of hours.</i>

20:25.850 --> 20:27.143
<i>He can't stop.</i>

20:27.643 --> 20:29.270
It's just not in his nature.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.734
<i>To stop, for him,</i>

20:34.817 --> 20:37.278
<i>and start to be in his head</i>
<i>and think about things</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:39.363
<i>really kind of almost scares him.</i>

20:41.574 --> 20:44.577
<i>He always has to have people around</i>
<i>when I'm not there.</i>

20:44.994 --> 20:47.580
<i>He'll have people in his room</i>
<i>until he goes to sleep</i>

20:47.663 --> 20:50.082
<i>just because he doesn't want to be alone.</i>

20:50.166 --> 20:53.294

21:01.927 --> 21:05.222
[Matt] Have you actually not said
a single word in two weeks now?

21:05.306 --> 21:07.516
Have you been able to get
even a whisper out?

21:08.309 --> 21:11.395

seven, eight years ago?

21:19.487 --> 21:22.531

Now I need to make sure
you guys take really good care of him.

22:14.708 --> 22:18.295
In an ideal scenario, when's
the next time he would be able to speak?

22:18.379 --> 22:19.672
Like two more days

22:19.755 --> 22:23.676
of not speaking, no voice lessons,
nothing like that for three weeks.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.929
No singing for a minimum of three weeks.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.475
Very successful.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.822
After I graduated from high school,
I chose UC Santa Barbara

23:26.905 --> 23:30.576
because there was a thriving
DIY hardcore community there.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.419
From that moment on, music was my life.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.632

"This train is leaving the station
and I'm gonna be on it."

32:59.561 --> 33:01.813
At that same time, I befriended DJ AM.

33:35.722 --> 33:38.058
He became a guru to me as a DJ.

I always thought of myself
as a promoter and record label guy.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.215

[automated voice] <i>Eighth floor.</i>

46:57.857 --> 47:01.694
[Matt] <i>Anyway, I wanted</i>
<i>to quickly go over MSG.</i>

47:04.989 --> 47:06.449
<i>So the news isn't great.</i>

47:07.074 --> 47:08.909
The short answer is that

47:08.993 --> 47:11.328
it took us a year to get that hold...

47:11.704 --> 47:14.206
and, to jump to the end,
it's gonna take us that long

47:14.290 --> 47:15.416
to try and get one back.

47:15.499 --> 47:18.252
We tried to get one for this year,
nothing's available--

47:18.335 --> 47:20.296
You're saying MSG is totally out?

47:24.091 --> 47:26.177
MSG is out for the foreseeable future.

47:26.260 --> 47:28.220
Basically, we can get back in line.

47:28.304 --> 47:31.849
The next foreseeable option
would be next summer.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.267
But then you go to Europe.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.019
By then, both albums are out.

47:35.102 --> 47:38.064
As far as album one goes,
it would be a full year later.

47:38.689 --> 47:41.025
I just don't understand
how there's no other--

47:41.108 --> 47:43.069
[Matt stammers] Because, I mean--

47:44.779 --> 47:47.865
Obviously, this is our first time doing
something of this size and scale.

47:48.365 --> 47:51.327
People book this stuff out
a year and a half out.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.121
There was a date in January,

47:54.205 --> 47:56.999
there was a date in February
and a date in April.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.793
All of them fell through.

47:59.502 --> 48:03.422
We lost our bid to whatever other...

48:04.048 --> 48:07.760
Ice Capades or, you know,
Bieber concert was happening.

48:11.305 --> 48:12.640
I wish I had better news.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.561
I know this show meant a lot to you.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.954
[Matt] <i>With his dad, from day one,</i>

48:35.579 --> 48:39.166
<i>it was always about, "Look what I did.</i>

48:39.250 --> 48:41.335
<i>Look what I'm accomplishing."</i>

48:44.046 --> 48:46.382
<i>Everything he accomplished,</i>
<i>"Send it to my dad.</i>

48:46.465 --> 48:49.009
<i>Can you frame this and send it to my dad?"</i>

48:49.093 --> 48:51.053
<i>I think it was about showing his dad that,</i>

48:51.137 --> 48:54.223
"Look, in many ways,
I can uphold the Aoki legacy."

48:56.308 --> 48:59.395
[Steve] <i>By '06-'07,</i>
<i>I started making money.</i>

49:00.771 --> 49:04.024
<i>I would show him,</i>
<i>"Look, I made my first $10,000</i>

49:04.108 --> 49:08.112
and I'm working this much this month
and I'm getting booked here and there."

49:12.116 --> 49:15.161
[Matt] <i>I remember during</i>
<i>the summer of '08,</i>

49:16.954 --> 49:20.916
by then he had become a popular DJ,
by no means a household name.

49:23.002 --> 49:25.087
<i>And then his dad's health started failing.</i>

49:26.797 --> 49:29.425
[Steve] <i>We found out</i>
<i>that he got hepatitis C.</i>

49:29.508 --> 49:33.888
We realized that this is something
that's very difficult to walk away from.

49:36.473 --> 49:39.768
<i>He later got diabetes</i>
<i>and then liver cirrhosis,</i>

49:39.894 --> 49:43.022
<i>and liver cirrhosis,</i>
<i>which led to tumors.</i>

49:45.232 --> 49:49.528
[Dan] <i>Steve definitely, at that time,</i>
<i>made it a point to go and see his dad</i>

49:49.612 --> 49:51.405
and spend more time with him.

49:51.906 --> 49:55.367
<i>And really get to know his dad</i>

49:55.451 --> 49:59.955
<i>because he didn't really have much</i>
<i>of an opportunity to do that growing up.</i>

50:05.544 --> 50:08.505
[Kevin] <i>The last few years</i>
<i>of my father's life,</i>

50:09.381 --> 50:12.218
all of us kids were always trying
to rally together.

50:13.594 --> 50:15.054
<i>When we all got together,</i>

50:15.137 --> 50:20.184
<i>Steven would always try to bring</i>
<i>a positive note to all his kids.</i>

50:21.977 --> 50:26.065
He had this thing called
"positive go," and he would point.

50:28.817 --> 50:30.986
<i>Even to this day, I remember my dad,</i>

50:32.488 --> 50:35.991
remembering that "positive go"
that Steven has.

50:41.497 --> 50:45.542
[Steve] <i>I remember being</i>
<i>in the hospital and...</i>

50:45.918 --> 50:48.128
<i>This is like his last couple of days.</i>

50:51.131 --> 50:55.094
There was one moment
when I finally had time with him.

50:55.678 --> 50:57.221
It was just me and him.

50:57.721 --> 51:01.225
It was actually the first time when

51:02.476 --> 51:04.353
I ever cried so much.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.815
I never cried in front of my dad.
I never did that, and...

51:09.400 --> 51:10.442
And, I just...

51:11.318 --> 51:15.072
Like, all those years...
I think everything all came out.

51:16.657 --> 51:21.996
<i>'Cause he's not the kind of guy to--</i>
<i>You don't cry with him. He doesn't--</i>

51:22.663 --> 51:25.582
<i>He's very much a patriarch,</i>
<i>very masculine.</i>

51:25.666 --> 51:28.669
<i>He's very Japanese in that way.</i>
<i>You know, you don't...</i>

51:29.920 --> 51:32.840
You just can't show that side
if you're a guy.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.258
If you're the daughter--

51:34.341 --> 51:36.969
If you're Devon, Echo or Grace,
you could do that but...

51:38.512 --> 51:41.140
You can't do that with him as a son.

51:42.433 --> 51:43.350
And...

51:44.143 --> 51:47.980
[stammers] I'm just so happy
that I was able to show him that.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.107
It was really...

51:52.067 --> 51:54.153
It was really...

51:55.154 --> 51:59.241
one of the most emotionally connected
moments I ever had with him.

52:00.242 --> 52:01.160
And there's...

52:02.411 --> 52:04.246
There's no words exchanged at all.

52:04.580 --> 52:05.956
It was just...

52:09.710 --> 52:11.086
Yeah, it was...

52:12.004 --> 52:15.924
Something that...
I'm so happy that happened.

52:16.717 --> 52:18.010
Just so he could...

52:19.553 --> 52:21.555
feel how much he meant to me.

52:41.992 --> 52:46.080
It affected Steve really, really badly.

52:52.795 --> 52:57.633
<i>We never really believed</i>
<i>that my dad could be...</i>

52:58.634 --> 53:00.594
taken down by anything.

53:04.056 --> 53:06.225
<i>He was such a challenger,</i>

53:06.308 --> 53:09.895
I thought he was indestructible.
Thought he would live forever.

53:17.319 --> 53:20.531
I believed that up until the day he died.

53:25.577 --> 53:28.205
<i>The last thing that he did was...</i>

53:28.747 --> 53:31.041
<i>he wrote the words,</i>
<i>"I'm going to challenge this"</i>

53:31.125 --> 53:32.501
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

53:47.057 --> 53:48.308
[Diplo] <i> When I first met Steve,</i>

53:48.392 --> 53:50.310
<i>I spoke to him almost</i>
<i>every night about his dad</i>

53:50.394 --> 53:52.104
<i>because I was fascinated by it.</i>

53:53.021 --> 53:55.441
I was like,
where you come from is fucking crazy.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.695
<i>I think he's motivated</i>
<i>by whatever weird...</i>

53:59.778 --> 54:03.198
passion his father had. His father seemed
like an insane person too.

54:17.212 --> 54:18.338
[Matt] <i>He's an adrenaline junkie.</i>

54:18.422 --> 54:22.718
<i>Whether he is competing</i>
<i>as a snowboarder to cliff diving,</i>

54:23.635 --> 54:24.595
<i>skydiving,</i>

54:25.095 --> 54:26.680
he just loves adrenaline.

54:30.350 --> 54:34.146
<i>And the biggest high he gets</i>
<i>is the live performance.</i>

54:37.983 --> 54:41.612
[Steve] <i>Performing your music</i>
<i>and having that connection,</i>

54:41.695 --> 54:45.824
with those thousands of people,
that is the ultimate rush.

54:45.908 --> 54:48.869
And that is the truest of addictions.

54:53.248 --> 54:55.250
[Matt] <i>Steve's a relentless addict.</i>

54:55.334 --> 54:57.461
He jumps from addiction to addiction.

55:00.506 --> 55:03.133
<i>He gets obsessed with things.</i>
<i>Right now, it's health.</i>

55:03.217 --> 55:04.426
Thank God.

55:05.636 --> 55:09.306
I'd much rather be yelling at promoters
for not delivering alkaline water

55:09.389 --> 55:12.893
than yelling at promoters because
he needs another bottle of vodka.

55:16.563 --> 55:17.940
For a while, he was a big drinker.

55:28.242 --> 55:31.078
[Steve] <i>I was always nervous</i>
<i>when I would start DJing,</i>

55:31.161 --> 55:33.247
<i>and I would get drunk all the time.</i>

55:36.083 --> 55:38.460
I mean, I was drinking all the time.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.675
[Matt] <i>To the point</i>
<i>that me and Adam talked about</i>

55:44.758 --> 55:46.093
just a step below an intervention.

55:51.139 --> 55:53.809
Adam had been sober for a dozen years.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.938
<i>He was like the king of sobriety.</i>

56:00.607 --> 56:02.067
He's gotten so dark in his life

56:02.150 --> 56:06.363
from being so controlled
and consumed by drugs

56:06.446 --> 56:08.365
that he tried to take his life.

56:10.951 --> 56:14.413
<i>In one instance</i>
<i>that he did put the gun to his head,</i>

56:14.955 --> 56:16.790
<i>the latch didn't go.</i>

56:16.957 --> 56:21.503
It spoke to him in a way
that he needed to completely change.

56:23.964 --> 56:27.342
<i>It's crazy that you have to get</i>
<i>to that dark, deep place...</i>

56:27.676 --> 56:29.511
<i>in order for you to change.</i>

56:35.183 --> 56:38.687
<i>I get this BBM</i>
<i>from a poker friend of mine.</i>

56:41.398 --> 56:43.275
"Yo, did you hear about AM?"

56:46.486 --> 56:47.738
It hit me pretty hard.

56:49.072 --> 56:52.868
I remember closing the door
to my office and calling Steve back.

56:53.410 --> 56:54.786
And I just said that...

56:57.456 --> 56:58.957
"You know, Adam's dead."

57:01.585 --> 57:03.211
It was... [sighs]

57:09.509 --> 57:11.845
[Travis] <i>After he passed away,</i>
<i>it was like...</i>

57:13.263 --> 57:16.183
I can't believe I lost him.
You know, it was like...

57:18.810 --> 57:20.103
Uh...

57:25.567 --> 57:27.527
[Matt] <i>I remember</i>
<i>Steve had a show that night.</i>

57:28.987 --> 57:31.531
[Steve] <i>I didn't understand</i>
<i>how to express myself.</i>

57:31.615 --> 57:33.408
How to, like, to deal with it.

57:34.993 --> 57:37.537
<i>But there was this really dark place.</i>

57:46.046 --> 57:48.173
<i>And then I just played.</i>

57:50.133 --> 57:53.637
<i>And 30 minutes in,</i>
<i>I played this Daft Punk record.</i>

57:55.097 --> 57:59.434
<i>And Daft Punk was the artist</i>
<i>that me and AM, we bonded over.</i>

58:01.853 --> 58:04.314
That's when I just broke down.
I just broke down.

58:07.275 --> 58:11.279
I was crying like... I couldn't believe
I was crying and playing it and...

58:22.582 --> 58:26.628
I had a hard time DJing,
I couldn't... I had to cut my set short.

58:29.965 --> 58:33.760
That same moment with my father,
it was like it all kinda came out.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.856
He took it harder than almost
he took his father's passing.

58:47.107 --> 58:50.027
[Steve] <i>That was it for me</i>
<i>as far as drinking. I was done.</i>

58:52.738 --> 58:56.074
There's no reason why
the two very close people of my life died.

59:01.329 --> 59:04.750
I think about it still,
it's so shocking that he's gone.

59:13.383 --> 59:16.386
He's one of the best human beings
I actually ever met.

59:18.430 --> 59:24.227
<i>So I feel very grateful</i>
<i>to have had someone like that in my life.</i>

59:25.437 --> 59:28.774
[Travis] <i>There were so many other people</i>
<i>that he touched.</i>

59:28.857 --> 59:33.737
He was always so positive
and always helping everyone around him.

59:37.616 --> 59:39.618
[Steve] <i>He always said one thing,</i>

59:41.078 --> 59:42.996
<i>"Starve the ego, feed the soul."</i>

59:44.456 --> 59:47.084
I mean, that's one thing
everyone can live by.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.608
[Steve] <i>I needed to go through a disaster</i>
<i>like MSG not happening</i>

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:18.657
in order to see why
and what makes Steve Aoki.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:26.248
And that's LA. That's going back to LA,
going back to my roots.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.459
<i>All the people supporting me,</i>

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:32.504
those are the people
I really need to be cherishing

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.923
and I really need to be investing my time

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:38.009
and, you know, obviously,
this is a big show tour.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.559
[Eric] <i>What I loved when we collaborated</i>
<i>together when I was running...</i>

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.603
It was the most hilarious
fund-raiser I've ever done

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:52.399
because half of the people were your fans,
who had no idea who I was.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.192
The others were a bunch of my supporters

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.194
who probably had never heard
of Steve Aoki.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:59.573
And it was this mix of
the craziest combinations of people

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.618
suddenly finding champagne on their face
and cakes in their hair

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:05.579
and it's not just politics,

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:09.332
but getting involved in the city.
I love this friendship to do that.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:11.042
-Absolutely.
-If we can get your fans

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.503
to help be part of their city,
they're gonna love it.

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.589
That's exactly the vibe.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.091
I don't want this to be
an ordinary Aoki show.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:22.470
I want this to be on the streets of LA.
I want it to be free.

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.764
Downtown would be a hot place to do it

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.350
because the revitalization
that's going on,

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.269
especially in the old corridors.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.063
Spring Street,
where you guys have your office.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:36.526
Broadway, which is--
Broadway has all those old theaters.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.737
I don't know.
I think it would be a great place.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.113
That would be amazing.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:43.491
That's a win-win for everybody
and a homecoming for you.

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:44.951
Yeah, big time.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.329
Do you want me to call New York
and tell them the bad news?

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.663
I'm happy to if you need me to.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.248
My friend Bill de Blasio--

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:52.000
[Steve] If anyone can, you can.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.628
He's a great mayor,
but I can call and let him know

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.379
it's going to be LA this time.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:57.923
-Yeah. Good stuff.
-All right.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.508
Mayor, thanks so much.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:03.220
-All love, man. Really excited to do this.
-It's gonna to be great.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:11.186
<i>I'm Mayor Eric Garcetti,</i>

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:15.190

[man] <i>The famous DJ partnered</i>
<i>with LA Mayor Eric Garcetti</i>

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.574
<i>as a way to celebrate the city.</i>

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:27.327
<i>A free concert with a civic-minded twist.</i>

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.954
<i>They are calling it LAoki.</i>

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.830
<i>-Steve Aoki's here.</i>
-Steve Aoki.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.666
<i>-We're talking to Steve Aoki.</i>
<i>-Steve Aoki.</i>

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.125
-Steve Aoki.
<i>-Steve Aoki!</i>

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.086
My album came out Tuesday.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:37.879
<i>His album's called </i> Neon Future.

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:40.340
-Neon Future.
<i>-Number one on iTunes already.</i>

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.342
<i>This guy's created a global movement.</i>

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.843
[man] <i>Steve, thanks for coming.</i>

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.971
[man 2] <i>Thanks for being on AMP radio.</i>

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.180
Thank you for coming by, my G.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.556
Steve Aoki, everybody.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.059
[man 3] <i>Steve Aoki, ladies</i>

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:11.204
[Steve] <i>This is 100% the most unique place</i>
<i>I've ever done a show.</i>

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:17.460
<i>Every significant milestone</i>
<i>in my music career</i>

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.547
all stemmed from being in LA.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.306
<i>Whether it was Dim Mak Records,</i>
<i>to me starting to DJ,</i>

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:31.725
<i>starting to produce electronic music,</i>

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.228
that was all just being here.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:39.941
<i>This is about the culture that I represent.</i>

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.444
<i>Bringing back the parties that we did</i>

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:46.156
<i>at Cinespace, at Dim Mak Tuesdays,</i>
<i>at Banana Splits,</i>

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.451
and that underground element.

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:55.999
AM would absolutely love
to be part of this

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:59.210
<i>because he was all about giving back</i>
<i>to the community.</i>

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.798
As a parallel with that
and what we're doing here,

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:07.844
<i>we're taking over the streets.</i>

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.391
That's punk rock, man.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.731
[Matt] <i>Man, this is kind of crazy.</i>

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.649
[Steve] <i>What? What's happening?</i>

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.778
[Matt] <i>It's pretty crazy.</i>
<i>Shutting down the middle of downtown.</i>

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.115
-<i>You're happy with the productions?</i>
-[Steve] <i>Yeah.</i>

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:32.243
[Matt laughs]
When you go out there, it's pretty cool.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:36.373
If you stand on the stage, you can see
five sets of streets lamps

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:38.291
all blinking red
and yellow intermittently.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.793
[Steve] Yeah, that's very cool.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.045
-[Matt] It's like a street rave.
-Yeah.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:48.885
[music plays]

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.911
[women laughing]

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:17.789
[Steve] Hey, mom.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.629
It's okay, mom. Don't worry.

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.005
Don't worry.

<i>How you doing out there, Los Angeles?</i>

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:41.391

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:04.664
[Chizuru, in Japanese] <i>At first,</i>
<i>I was shocked when I saw him perform.</i>

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:10.878
<i>We never imagined</i>

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:19.636
<i>I think that Rocky</i>
<i>would be so proud of Steve.</i>

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:28.395
I'm sure that Steve would also...

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:34.736
want Rocky to see his accomplishments.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:54.130
[song playing]

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:06.768
I go to Steve's concerts and,
as his little sister,

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.812
I... I'm so proud of him.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:17.403
I can't even begin to imagine
what it would be like for my dad.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:25.370
[Matt] <i>You look at all the kids</i>
<i>in that family.</i>

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:27.747
<i>Somehow the black sheep, so to speak,</i>

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.999
is the one that is carrying
the Aoki name on.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.935

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.445
[Grace] That was amazing. I can't...
Look at this.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:25.656
-Daddy
-I know! I remember!

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:29.452
-I wish he could have seen you.
-Yeah. It's OK.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.704
But he sees you. Right?

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.415
I can feel your heart.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:36.834
Your heart is really there.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:41.130
I don't really like to think about it
because then I start crying too.

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.509
[Chizuru, in Japanese]
<i>Rocky would probably say...</i>

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:55.228
Rocky would probably say,
"That's my son."

<i>Would you raise your son or daughter</i>

<i>The tough love bit... that's his make-up.</i>

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:14.330
<i>That's how he is as a human being.</i>

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:18.501
I feel like I'm a big kid already,
so I'd actually...

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:19.627
I think I'd be a good dad.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:25.716
You know, I'll just be like
my little kid's best buddy.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:33.975
[Dan] <i>I definitely do see how</i>
<i>Steve considers his dad a hero.</i>

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:39.897
<i>The same drive that his dad had,</i>
<i>Steve inherited.</i>

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:45.069
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>Steve has a massive heart</i>

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:47.071
and he got that from his mom.

<i>You know, I have this inherent drive</i>
<i>to prove something to my father,</i>

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:06.007
but, over the course of my life,

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.010
when I think about
the most supportive person...

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.597
it would have to be my mother.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:17.059

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:19.854

[Steve] <i>If I needed that reassurance</i>
<i>and that motherly love,</i>

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:38.247
<i>I went back to my mom.</i>

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.464
<i>I made some</i>
<i>pretty wild decisions in my life</i>

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.968
that a parent would, you know,
probably walk away from

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.887
but she kind of stuck by me.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:03.314
[Devon] <i>When he became a DJ,</i>
<i>she was hugely supportive of him.</i>

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:07.610
<i>He was living in this crappy apartment.</i>

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:10.571
There wasn't really that much progress

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:14.951
and she never doubted him for a second.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:20.665
She had such blind belief in him,

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:22.792
in his potential.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:31.175

<i>Let's take over the world together,</i>
<i>one little step at a time."</i>

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:47.525
<i>You know, as a kid you need</i>
<i>your parents to reinforce your ideas.</i>

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.029
<i>Can't always be a tough guy.</i>

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.119
<i>I guess that's the hard part</i>
<i>about being a parent.</i>

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.163
<i>You know, you got to make</i>
<i>that decision, and it's...</i>

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:05.835
The decision that you make can affect
your child for the rest of their life.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.636
[man] <i>And they're puttin' it to him now.</i>

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.806
<i>He's got the hammer down,</i>
<i>and he's really going for it.</i>

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:22.435
I don't think I was
supposed to succeed as a DJ.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.979
<i>And somehow I'm in a place where</i>

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:29.900
I've kind of made it, but I feel like
there's a lot more to go for me.

[man] <i>Rocky Aoki</i>

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:43.039
I don't really know if I can chill out.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:45.499
<i>I don't know if I have the capacity.</i>

I got a lot more to do."
