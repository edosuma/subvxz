WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.978
Hey, Mr. Belvedere, there's two
guys outside with a giant box,

00:04.979 --> 00:07.019
and it's got "happy birthday"
written all over it.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.004
There it is.

00:09.005 --> 00:10.087
Hey, guys.

00:10.088 --> 00:12.073
Pay up, gentlemen.
She's sitting on the couch.

00:12.374 --> 00:13.214
Yeah, right, you won.

00:13.215 --> 00:14.400
Let me get a four.

00:14.403 --> 00:16.020
TGIF marathon tonight.

00:16.521 --> 00:18.067
- What?
- I can't take this any more.

00:18.070 --> 00:19.520
What is happening?

00:19.521 --> 00:21.121
I've actually been working on something.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.546
A résumé, maybe?

00:26.096 --> 00:28.533
Did I do that?

00:30.508 --> 00:32.668
I'm sorry. Did you just say
you were working on that?

00:32.668 --> 00:34.507
- It's Urkel!
- Urkel?

00:34.508 --> 00:35.550
Urkel.

00:35.551 --> 00:37.499
Urkel, Jess?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.512
- It's funny.
- Okay, look,

00:39.515 --> 00:41.528
It is perfectly fine to watch TV all day.

00:41.529 --> 00:43.512
- No, it is not.
- No, it's not.

00:43.515 --> 00:44.571
- But Urkel?!
- Come on.

00:44.574 --> 00:46.582
Not even in my darkest
moments did I do Urkel.

00:46.583 --> 00:48.623
Guys, that's crazy.
This is objectively hilarious.

00:48.624 --> 00:51.720
I can do any character from
an '80s sitcom. Quiz me.

00:51.721 --> 00:52.504
No.

00:52.507 --> 00:55.592
Alf, don't eat the cat!

00:57.529 --> 00:59.996
Get out of the city,
Cousin Larry Appleton.

01:01.512 --> 01:03.508
- I'm Frasier Crane.
- No!

01:03.959 --> 01:06.005
Jess, the men in suits here,
the professionals,

01:06.006 --> 01:08.846
- would like to know what the plan is.
- I'm a professional, too, pal.

01:08.847 --> 01:10.407
You're not. Please,
you work in a bar.

01:10.408 --> 01:12.768
It's a whole different thing.
I respect you. Just, please.

01:12.769 --> 01:14.566
I don't know what the plan is, Schmidt,

01:14.567 --> 01:17.520
but I love working
at the Casserole Shanty.

01:17.521 --> 01:20.507
Today I got a locker, and in 18 months,

01:20.508 --> 01:22.502
I'm gonna roll into
some sweet dental coverage.

01:22.503 --> 01:24.500
So, yeah, my job pretty much rules.

01:25.521 --> 01:27.524
Low on bean! Low on bean!

01:27.525 --> 01:30.537
I repeat: I'm low on bean!

01:30.538 --> 01:32.516
I'm good on bean!

01:32.517 --> 01:34.877
Would you like to know what
I did at my job all day today?

01:34.878 --> 01:37.278
- Don't say "crushed it."
- I'm gonna go with "crushed it."

01:37.279 --> 01:38.532
Funny enough, I crushed it.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.594
I crushed it all day today,
and then I crushed it some more.

01:41.595 --> 01:43.115
And then it asked me what I was doing,

01:43.116 --> 01:44.596
and I told it that I was crushing it.

01:45.076 --> 01:48.011
That's what I do on a daily basis, Jess.

01:48.012 --> 01:50.074
You used to inspire me.

01:50.075 --> 01:52.020
I mean, not specifically...

01:52.021 --> 01:54.141
because I find teaching
to be icky... but, you know,

01:54.142 --> 01:56.182
in a vague kind of
"Look at that go-getter in a...

01:56.183 --> 01:58.012
in a brightly colored sweater"
kind of way.

01:58.013 --> 02:00.074
What happened to the inspiring,
visor-less Jess?

02:01.096 --> 02:03.000
Hey, maybe that's her.

02:04.038 --> 02:07.087
Hey, we just moved in across the hall.

02:07.088 --> 02:09.027
I'm Chaz.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.999
This is Fife, Sutton and Brorie.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.029
What's up? Schmidt.

02:16.038 --> 02:18.021
Any-turds, just wanted
to give you a heads up

02:18.022 --> 02:20.062
that we're having some
people over to hang tonight

02:20.063 --> 02:23.038
- and it might get a little loud.
- I like where your head is at.

02:23.039 --> 02:25.008
We're gonna be there with bells on.

02:25.009 --> 02:27.058
Dolla-dolla bells, y'all.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.182
Well, it's just going to be
a bunch of young people.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.053
So...

02:35.054 --> 02:37.016
Hi. I live here, too.

02:37.017 --> 02:39.016
What are you names?
Schmidt!

02:39.017 --> 02:42.017
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ - ♪Who's that girl?♪
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync by Alice | www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:42.018 --> 02:44.003
♪ It's Jess. ♪
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync by Alice | www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:44.004 --> 02:45.054
So, when he said,

02:45.055 --> 02:47.082
"It's just going to be a
bunch of young people,"

02:47.083 --> 02:49.032
well, he must have meant, "You,"

02:49.033 --> 02:51.091
meaning me, fellow young person,

02:51.092 --> 02:53.053
"You'll feel right at home.

02:53.054 --> 02:57.016
And you two walking
corpses, stay away."

02:57.017 --> 02:59.004
You're six months younger
than me, Schmidt.

02:59.005 --> 03:01.004
- You're a corpse for sure.
- Behold.

03:01.007 --> 03:05.049
This actuarial table stops at age 99.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.971
But if you track my current trajectory,

03:06.972 --> 03:09.092
I'm clearly gonna live till
I'm 123 years old, so...

03:09.093 --> 03:11.095
Hello, robot sex.

03:11.096 --> 03:13.070
Is this accurate?

03:13.071 --> 03:15.735
No, no, no, Winston,
I spend $49.95 a month

03:15.736 --> 03:17.096
on a subscription to an inaccurate

03:17.097 --> 03:19.082
real-time actuarial service.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.087
Then I think I may have died
four years ago.

03:21.088 --> 03:23.091
Yeah?
That sucks.

03:23.092 --> 03:27.078
"African-American male,
life expectancy: 67 years"?

03:27.079 --> 03:28.088
Sounds about right.

03:28.089 --> 03:30.091
"Minus one year if you frequently question

03:30.092 --> 03:31.939
your career choice."
Check.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.700
"Minus one year
if your chosen field offers

03:33.701 --> 03:35.141
few opportunities
for advancement."

03:35.142 --> 03:36.062
Check and double check.

03:36.063 --> 03:38.999
I like getting older.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.040
I feel like I'm finally aging
into my personality.

03:44.062 --> 03:46.070
Keep this crap out of my yard!

03:47.097 --> 03:50.083
And turn that nonsense down!

03:52.083 --> 03:54.999
They never did get that Frisbee back.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.021
- I used that Frisbee as a dish.
- Seriously?

03:57.024 --> 04:00.042
- I used it for pistachios in my room.
- Not only am I the

04:00.045 --> 04:03.028
youngest person in this loft,
I'm also the most successful.

04:03.029 --> 04:03.855
Shut up, Schmidt.

04:03.856 --> 04:06.056
Are you honestly measuring
yourself like a little boy?

04:06.057 --> 04:08.137
I'm sorry that you're not
growing any more like me.

04:08.138 --> 04:09.978
And apparently,
I'm gonna be growing forever.

04:09.979 --> 04:11.579
I'm like a Jewish Peter Pan.
Petya Pan.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.009
Petter Pan. Pesach Pan.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.209
Why don't you take it down
a notch before this old man

04:16.211 --> 04:18.091
takes you outside and
makes you pick a switch?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.932
I'm like Snow Leopard.
You guys are like DOS.

04:19.933 --> 04:20.653
And as your elder,

04:20.654 --> 04:23.214
Can I give you a little advice, Schmidt?
Can we talk for a sec?

04:23.215 --> 04:23.415
Sure.

04:23.418 --> 04:25.698
- Yes, yes.
- 'Cause you've kind of gotten under my skin

04:25.699 --> 04:27.219
- A little bit.
- Shoot, Gran Torino.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.079
I'm gonna die so soon.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.040
Do you think that the
neighbors will want, like,

04:38.041 --> 04:39.081
four individual casseroles

04:39.082 --> 04:41.040
or, like, one large
party-size casserole?

04:41.041 --> 04:42.088
Yes, Jess, that's exactly

04:42.089 --> 04:45.016
what hip, trendy millennials
want to eat: casserole.

04:45.017 --> 04:48.078
Now come on, guys,
just tighten up, all right?

04:48.079 --> 04:51.008
- Think young. What the hell is that smell?
- It's Old Spice.

04:51.011 --> 04:52.731
- I'm smelling Old Spice?
- Yeah, and yes,

04:52.732 --> 04:55.092
It has "Old" in the title,
and yes, it's all over my body.

04:55.093 --> 04:57.157
- Okay, well, take it off.
- I'm wearing the Spice. The Spice is cool.

04:57.158 --> 04:58.998
It's not even a real
spice, man. Take it off.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.839
The Spice is coming back!
Everybody knows it!

05:00.840 --> 05:01.680
The guy on the horse!

05:01.681 --> 05:03.521
You can wear any spice.
Don't wear Old Spice!

05:03.522 --> 05:04.402
Classic cologne fight.

05:06.058 --> 05:07.092
- Guys!
- Shh!

05:08.092 --> 05:10.074
Hi.

05:10.075 --> 05:13.032
Zander and Raj went to Pate's thing,

05:13.033 --> 05:15.067
so tonight's been notched down
to a "chill hang."

05:15.068 --> 05:16.999
Cool.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.054
I'll just put these...

05:18.057 --> 05:21.008
Thanks for having us.

05:21.092 --> 05:23.087
No, can't do this.

05:23.088 --> 05:25.038
- What is up?
- Have fun, kids.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.061
Party hip-hop.
What's going on, kids?

05:27.062 --> 05:28.078
Let's party.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.078
What are you guys doing, what is that?

05:30.079 --> 05:33.003
Is that Top Gun? Look at that.

05:33.004 --> 05:34.484
Look at Anthony Eds, the "Goose" man.

05:34.485 --> 05:37.028
Unbelievable that he dies in a few scenes.

05:37.029 --> 05:38.049
Goose dies?

05:38.050 --> 05:40.011
Not cool, man.

05:40.012 --> 05:41.932
No, it's... Look, nobody
does an onscreen death

05:41.933 --> 05:43.045
like Anthony Eds.

05:43.046 --> 05:45.046
He's like the Hilary Swank of bald men.

05:46.088 --> 05:48.065
He's like the Hilary Swank of bald...

05:48.066 --> 05:49.083
Hold everything.

05:49.084 --> 05:51.061
Is that Cass Shant?

05:51.062 --> 05:53.999
Casserole Shanty?
That's where I work.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.080
Your chicken-broccoli
totally fuels my night bikes.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.088
I'm very happy to help.

05:57.089 --> 06:01.058
- Some of my friends don't appreciate it.
- No.

06:01.059 --> 06:03.050
You're just figuring it out, just like us.

06:03.051 --> 06:05.029
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:05.030 --> 06:06.079
I am figuring it out.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.024
Thank you, Brorie. I am.

06:08.025 --> 06:10.061
I'm just figuring it out, and that's okay.

06:11.062 --> 06:12.074
What do you guys do?

06:12.075 --> 06:13.675
- I work at home. - I'm a DJ.
- Well...

06:13.676 --> 06:15.076
Was I unclear about my night bikes?

06:15.077 --> 06:17.049
I work for a
single-national corporation

06:17.050 --> 06:19.066
called Associated Strategies.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.053
Moo...

06:21.047 --> 06:22.075
- Moo...
- I know. Yeah.

06:22.076 --> 06:23.156
Totally, Fife.
I get that.

06:25.054 --> 06:27.053
Moo...

06:27.054 --> 06:30.058
Moo...!

06:31.067 --> 06:32.227
Right? That's a thing, right?

06:32.228 --> 06:34.003
Yeah? Moo?

06:34.004 --> 06:35.075
Schmidt, you don't know...

06:37.046 --> 06:39.029
Jess.

06:40.067 --> 06:44.007
Did I do that?

06:47.993 --> 06:49.393
How did you just come up with that?

06:49.394 --> 06:50.314
Where did you get that?

06:50.315 --> 06:51.075
It just came to me.

06:51.076 --> 06:53.028
Where did that come from?

06:53.029 --> 06:54.050
I just thought of it.

06:54.051 --> 06:56.091
That's how she casseroles!

06:56.092 --> 06:58.071
What?

07:05.071 --> 07:06.566
Hey, Nana, Pop-Pop.

07:06.567 --> 07:08.047
You missed an unreal hang last night.

07:08.048 --> 07:10.070
Unreal with a capital ""

07:10.071 --> 07:12.057
Really?

07:12.058 --> 07:14.008
Those kids with the found furniture

07:14.009 --> 07:16.011
and no TV because it's cool?

07:16.012 --> 07:17.372
It's a different world over there.

07:17.373 --> 07:20.066
A world where it's okay to only
have a part-time job.

07:20.067 --> 07:23.074
A world where it's okay
that I'm still finding myself.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.074
A world where I have not one,
but two catchphrases.

07:26.075 --> 07:29.046
$500.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.057
How rude!

07:33.071 --> 07:34.087
How rude!

07:34.088 --> 07:36.045
Just take it!

07:36.046 --> 07:37.126
They think I made those up.

07:37.589 --> 07:40.037
There's just one tiny hitch.

07:41.038 --> 07:43.158
It's very awkward, and I
don't know how to say it...

07:43.159 --> 07:44.075
They hate Schmidt.

07:44.076 --> 07:47.003
So much.
How did you know?

07:47.004 --> 07:49.284
If I had a dollar for everybody
I couldn't hang out with

07:49.285 --> 07:51.054
because they hated Schmidt, I'd be rich.

07:51.055 --> 07:55.066
Like, fill my gas tank
all the way up rich.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.011
He was all over the map.

07:57.012 --> 07:59.032
He spent 20 minutes talking about aioli.

07:59.033 --> 08:00.353
Don't worry about it.
I'm on it.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.057
What do you mean, you're on it?

08:02.058 --> 08:04.057
You're gonna prank him,
aren't you? I-I knew it!

08:04.058 --> 08:06.015
I knew it!
You're gonna prank him.

08:06.016 --> 08:08.023
Hey, can I help you?
I'm really good with pranks?

08:08.024 --> 08:09.344
You may not help with the pranks.

08:09.345 --> 08:11.305
Why not, man? I'm the best
with the pranks, man.

08:11.306 --> 08:13.971
- They call me "Prank Sinatra."
- No, you call you Prank Sinatra.

08:13.972 --> 08:16.012
- Come... 'Cause I am.
- Winston, you're the worst

08:16.013 --> 08:17.173
at pranks in the whole world.

08:17.174 --> 08:18.414
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

08:18.415 --> 08:20.095
You either go way too small...

08:21.096 --> 08:22.078
Hey.

08:22.079 --> 08:26.016
Let's pour a little juice near her shoe.

08:26.017 --> 08:27.058
...Or you go way too big.

08:28.059 --> 08:32.061
Hey, let's hit her in
the throat with a ski.

08:32.062 --> 08:34.071
You don't have a pranking sweet spot.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.011
Speaking of...

08:39.054 --> 08:40.054
Are you limping?

08:40.054 --> 08:42.028
My hip is achy.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.349
I wonder if it's your shoes.
Did you try different shoes?

08:44.350 --> 08:46.031
I try on four different pairs of shoes

08:46.032 --> 08:48.023
with every outfit,
rain or shine. You know that.

08:48.024 --> 08:49.044
What did you do?

08:49.045 --> 08:51.036
Well, he could try on 100 different pairs.

08:51.037 --> 08:52.096
It's not going to matter.

08:52.097 --> 08:55.016
The left heel is an eighth
of an inch shorter

08:55.017 --> 08:56.033
on every single pair.

08:58.046 --> 09:00.007
This is so crazy, Nick.

09:00.008 --> 09:02.028
My God, you know what we should do?

09:02.029 --> 09:03.229
We should take those shavings,

09:03.230 --> 09:06.057
and then sprinkle them by his car.

09:06.058 --> 09:07.999
Let me just get this clear.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.054
- Take the little bit of dust
- Yeah, 'cause...

09:10.057 --> 09:14.004
- And go outside and put it near his car?
- Yes.

09:14.005 --> 09:15.445
- That's not a prank.
- Yes, it is.

09:15.446 --> 09:16.999
That's just kind of littering.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.880
- His whole ride to work,
- Okay, you're done.

09:18.881 --> 09:20.121
He'd be thinking, like, "What?"

09:20.122 --> 09:21.058
So we're pranking him

09:21.059 --> 09:23.095
so he thinks
while we're not around, "What?"

09:23.096 --> 09:25.049
It's too small.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.049
You've got to go bigger than that.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.061
Well, anyway,

09:28.062 --> 09:31.042
- I got to fill this up with pee.
- Ew! Why?

09:31.043 --> 09:32.611
So I can pour it all over Schmidt's bed

09:32.612 --> 09:34.052
and make him think he's incontinent.

09:34.053 --> 09:35.058
That's disgusting, Nick.

09:35.059 --> 09:38.053
Hey, sometimes up close, art is ugly.

09:39.054 --> 09:40.049
I got an idea.

09:40.050 --> 09:43.087
Instead of urine, we use acid.

09:43.088 --> 09:45.095
And put it on his face!

09:45.096 --> 09:47.067
All right?

09:50.033 --> 09:52.027
Jess, do these pants seem long to you?

09:52.028 --> 09:54.228
Nick picked them up from
the dry cleaner for me today,

09:54.229 --> 09:56.999
and I don't know,
I swear they seem longer.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.943
I think your pants look fine.

09:58.944 --> 10:00.904
Okay, Jess, tonight,
you're obviously gonna want

10:00.905 --> 10:01.625
to follow my lead.

10:01.626 --> 10:03.066
I don't know how to tell you this...

10:03.067 --> 10:06.020
Actually, I do:
They hate you.

10:06.021 --> 10:07.057
That's crazy.

10:07.058 --> 10:10.049
It is crazy...
how much they hate you.

10:10.050 --> 10:12.070
Watch. Every time
you say something,

10:12.071 --> 10:14.036
they're gonna change
the subject immediately.

10:14.037 --> 10:16.019
That's how you tell if people hate you.

10:16.020 --> 10:18.180
I'm pretty sure I know how
to crush it with the kids.

10:19.084 --> 10:21.057
Watch this.

10:21.058 --> 10:22.066
Hey, guys.

10:22.067 --> 10:24.003
What up, yo?

10:24.004 --> 10:26.004
Throw your damn hands up.
We hanging out tonight?

10:26.597 --> 10:28.024
Jess, I love your hair.

10:28.025 --> 10:29.562
- It is so good today.
- Yeah!

10:29.565 --> 10:31.049
Thank you!

10:31.050 --> 10:33.029
- Flowy. - Yes.
- Really curly.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.590
What do you guys think about the length

10:34.591 --> 10:37.038
of my sideburns? It's new.
Daring or gauche?

10:39.071 --> 10:41.016
I got my plane ticket home for Easter.

10:41.017 --> 10:42.337
Thank you for reminding me, Jess.

10:42.338 --> 10:44.003
Yeah. No, of course.

10:44.004 --> 10:45.604
I've got, like, a little calendar thing.

10:45.605 --> 10:47.061
You know, I've got a great,

10:47.062 --> 10:51.598
I've got a great
plane ticket guy that you...

10:51.599 --> 10:53.159
We're having another hang tonight Jess.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.480
Got some chokes, hula hoops,
sitar. You should come over.

10:55.481 --> 10:57.401
- Yeah!
- Yeah, no, like, that's the best idea.

10:57.402 --> 10:58.058
Totally.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:08.054 --> 11:11.007
You, too, Schmidt.

11:17.038 --> 11:19.029
Hey, I got to...
I got to take this.

11:20.812 --> 11:23.037
Ferguson? Is that you?

11:23.038 --> 11:25.053
Yeah, t-tonight?

11:25.054 --> 11:28.007
Well, I mean...

11:28.008 --> 11:29.015
I made plans with...

11:29.016 --> 11:30.075
Well, look,

11:30.076 --> 11:33.028
if that's the comptroller's
time line, then...

11:33.029 --> 11:35.010
that's the comptroller's time line.

11:35.011 --> 11:36.038
Well, hell, yes,

11:36.039 --> 11:38.070
send a car!

11:38.071 --> 11:41.028
Jess, do you want to
hula-hoop with me

11:41.029 --> 11:42.033
all night-slash-forever?

11:45.021 --> 11:47.032
Gosh.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.550
They hate me.

11:55.017 --> 11:57.377
Man, I've never seen you work
this hard at anything, ever.

11:57.378 --> 11:58.578
That's because I care so much.

11:58.579 --> 12:01.528
I set an alarm
for 5:00 a.m.

12:01.529 --> 12:04.010
so I could switch Schmidt's
fiber pills with placebos.

12:04.205 --> 12:05.765
Damn it, I want to care about something

12:05.766 --> 12:07.766
as much as you care
about ruining Schmidt's life.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.647
And where have you
been all night, young lady?

12:09.648 --> 12:12.511
Jumping around to
your hippity-hop?

12:12.512 --> 12:15.532
Taking your drug pills
and smoking your hash stick?

12:15.533 --> 12:17.813
I'm actually asking... I'm not
doing a thing right here.

12:17.814 --> 12:19.570
Those guys are so much fun.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.578
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been up

12:21.579 --> 12:26.524
for 48 hours, so I'm gonna just
sleep off an ass-ton of quinoa.

12:26.525 --> 12:29.045
No, there's no time for sleep!
Guys, here's what we got to do.

12:29.046 --> 12:31.006
We got to find the passion
that we have in life,

12:31.007 --> 12:32.511
and we got to hold on to it.

12:32.512 --> 12:33.872
- You're so right.
- Just like...

12:33.873 --> 12:35.520
I can't believe I'm saying this...

12:35.521 --> 12:36.567
just like Nick Miller.

12:36.568 --> 12:38.361
Why, look at that.

12:38.362 --> 12:39.882
I've never been an inspiration before.

12:39.883 --> 12:40.523
I don't like it.

12:40.524 --> 12:41.684
It's too much responsibility.

12:41.685 --> 12:43.537
Ay-ay-ay.

12:43.538 --> 12:45.532
I am cons-to-the-pizzo.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.516
Constipated.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.532
I'm constipated.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.516
Surprising.

12:52.517 --> 12:54.591
Here, sit down, relax, watch some TV.

12:54.592 --> 12:56.566
What's the chair doing over here?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.574
Just moved it.

12:58.575 --> 13:02.504
Gosh.

13:05.533 --> 13:06.853
Turn it down, man!
Turn it down!

13:06.854 --> 13:08.550
- Turn it... What?
- It's too loud!

13:08.553 --> 13:10.582
Schmidt, you're blasting
the TV, you maniac!

13:10.583 --> 13:12.528
You can hear that?

13:12.529 --> 13:14.591
It's blasting, Schmidt!
Jess is trying to sleep!

13:14.592 --> 13:17.529
- You can hear this?
- Yes.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.970
Well, you know what, you were right.

13:18.971 --> 13:21.499
They hate me, and I
know why they hate me, too.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.820
It's because I'm old, and
they're the future of humanity,

13:23.821 --> 13:25.591
a pan-ethnic,
pan-sexual hive mind,

13:25.592 --> 13:28.528
and they want nothing to do with me.

13:28.529 --> 13:29.809
They're not that great, Schmidt.

13:29.810 --> 13:30.890
Last night, Chaz and Sutton

13:30.891 --> 13:32.592
- got in a fight.
- A lovers' quarrel?

13:32.595 --> 13:34.520
Sutton and Chaz are not a couple.

13:34.521 --> 13:36.537
Chaz is with Fife;
Brorie's with,

13:36.538 --> 13:38.529
- the other broad.
- Actually,

13:38.530 --> 13:40.523
Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad,

13:40.524 --> 13:41.588
and Chaz is a floater.

13:41.589 --> 13:43.574
They're poly-amorous?
Damn it!

13:43.575 --> 13:45.554
Jess, you've got to help me

13:45.555 --> 13:48.575
- help them forget how old I am.
- You're not old.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.818
- Then how do you explain this?
- Use your legs, buddy.

13:50.819 --> 13:53.571
- Let me show you something.
- Gonna hurt your back.

13:55.596 --> 13:59.528
Look at this...
I'm freaking shrinking!

13:59.529 --> 14:01.289
I took a photo of the wall,
shrunk it down,

14:01.290 --> 14:02.770
made a copy at an architect's office.

14:02.771 --> 14:04.554
From there, it was just your basic

14:04.555 --> 14:06.520
spackle-and-silkscreen job.

14:06.521 --> 14:08.537
I don't care, but... yay.

14:08.538 --> 14:10.618
It's a weird life,
but it's where I'm at right now.

14:10.619 --> 14:11.567
Okay.

14:15.575 --> 14:18.516
Jess...
this is the hardest thing

14:18.517 --> 14:19.558
I've ever had to say.

14:20.558 --> 14:22.521
Please help me be cool.

14:24.529 --> 14:26.528
Say that one more time.

14:26.529 --> 14:29.557
Visor-wearing Jess,

14:29.558 --> 14:31.595
will you please help me be cool?

14:36.538 --> 14:37.579
Okay, listen up,

14:37.580 --> 14:39.520
I got 3.5 years to live.

14:39.521 --> 14:41.503
I can't be an assistant any more.

14:41.504 --> 14:43.503
I don't want to die.
I want to work.

14:43.504 --> 14:44.704
Honestly, I want to work here.

14:44.705 --> 14:46.541
But I got to follow my passion,

14:46.542 --> 14:49.516
much like a running back would want

14:49.517 --> 14:52.574
when given the ball,
and in the game of life,

14:52.575 --> 14:54.528
this job is the pigskin.

14:54.529 --> 14:56.583
And damn it, I'm in the red zone!

14:58.500 --> 15:02.503
And in summation, I feel...

15:02.504 --> 15:05.528
very good about what I just said.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.521
Hopefully, you do, too.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.512
Who wants to start an arcade fire?

15:17.579 --> 15:19.524
Schmidt.

15:19.525 --> 15:21.562
- What?
- What are you doing? This is not

15:21.565 --> 15:23.520
the outfit we talked about.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.525
- What? Rock and roll.
- You way overshot it.

15:25.528 --> 15:27.557
Look at that.
I'm being ironic.

15:27.558 --> 15:29.515
That's not ironic;
That's just a bad pun.

15:29.516 --> 15:30.636
And what are you doing here?

15:30.637 --> 15:32.542
Your arms are hot, but your neck is cold?

15:32.543 --> 15:34.520
Hey, look at me.

15:34.521 --> 15:35.721
If you guys keep a tight core,

15:35.722 --> 15:39.522
you can... your burpees
can look like this, too.

15:39.523 --> 15:40.883
When's the Olympics?
Right, guys?

15:40.884 --> 15:41.964
I'm gonna set a PR tonight.

15:41.965 --> 15:43.565
Well, you know,
he's not... he's not...

15:43.566 --> 15:45.517
Parkour.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.511
You got beer on her, man.

15:51.512 --> 15:53.561
Did I do that?

15:53.562 --> 15:55.521
Don't worry, my mom
can throw that dress in

15:55.522 --> 15:57.541
with my laundry next time she's here.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.549
Sorry.
Your mom does your laundry?

15:59.550 --> 16:01.525
Washer-dryer kind of
freaks me out, you know?

16:01.526 --> 16:03.545
It's just, like...

16:03.546 --> 16:05.503
washa-washa-washa,

16:05.504 --> 16:07.525
- guh-guh, guh-guh, -guh-guh-guh.
- On the noise.

16:07.526 --> 16:08.806
Okay, you know what?
It's fine.

16:08.807 --> 16:09.807
I'll-I'll wash it myself.

16:09.808 --> 16:11.562
- All right.
- Thank you, though.

16:11.565 --> 16:13.566
She's so iconoclastic and modern.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.517
And she even got our dishwasher to work.

16:15.518 --> 16:16.592
- I remember.
- You know,

16:16.595 --> 16:19.520
I mean, I just...
it wasn't that big a deal.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.574
It was just... I just...
I just turned it on.

16:21.575 --> 16:23.595
There was a button
that said "on."

16:23.596 --> 16:26.511
It's weird how the dishwasher
just lives under the counter.

16:26.512 --> 16:28.520
How come there's
no dish-dryer?

16:28.521 --> 16:29.583
Or un-washer.

16:29.584 --> 16:32.537
My God, you guys, are
we the dish un-washers?

16:32.538 --> 16:34.545
Why don't we just move to Prague?

16:34.546 --> 16:36.532
I need to focus on my art.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.561
You can totally focus
on your art in Prague.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.558
If we move to Prague, should I

16:40.559 --> 16:42.520
paint my nails black again?

16:42.521 --> 16:44.503
Hey, you guys,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.595
I can't hang out with you any more.

16:46.596 --> 16:48.525
- Why not?
- Because...

16:48.528 --> 16:50.566
Our entire relationship's built on a lie.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.499
Jess, what are you talking about?

16:52.500 --> 16:53.583
I did not make up...

16:53.584 --> 16:56.575
- "Did I do that?"
- Jess, please don't...

16:56.578 --> 16:58.562
- I have to introduce you to a...
- Don't do it.

16:58.565 --> 17:01.524
Little, adorable
African-American nerd.

17:01.525 --> 17:03.524
Don't press the
button. Don't...

17:04.559 --> 17:06.523
Jess, why would you

17:06.525 --> 17:07.523
do this to us?

17:07.525 --> 17:09.541
Who's "Steve Urclee"?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.949
Jess, what the hell was that?

17:15.950 --> 17:17.790
You were supposed to
teach me how to be cool.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.671
You did a terrible job.
Look what I'm wearing.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.152
You didn't listen to anything I said!

17:21.153 --> 17:22.579
I told you to stop trying so hard.

17:22.579 --> 17:24.557
I will never stop trying.

17:24.558 --> 17:26.538
I don't care if I have
to do a billion burpees.

17:26.539 --> 17:28.569
That is how you crush...
you never give up.

17:28.570 --> 17:31.516
That is the difference
between me and you, Jess.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.521
Is that what you think?
You think I just gave up?

17:35.522 --> 17:37.517
- Well...
- I was fired, Schmidt.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.557
Do you think I wanted to stop teaching?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.558
That's why I liked hanging
out with those kids...

17:41.559 --> 17:43.508
'cause they weren't
judging me all the time

17:43.509 --> 17:45.499
for not crushing it.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.300
- Okay...
- Do you think that I want to work

17:47.301 --> 17:48.524
At the Casserole Shanty?

17:48.525 --> 17:51.499
Do you know what the people
I work with call it?

17:51.500 --> 17:53.561
The Ass-erole Shanty.

17:58.533 --> 17:59.567
Just don't stop teaching.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.591
I mean, there's got to be something.

18:02.592 --> 18:05.592
I don't know, driver's ed, CPR...

18:05.595 --> 18:07.566
A smile class.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.553
My life sucks so much right now.

18:10.054 --> 18:12.503
But at least I'm not 23.

18:12.504 --> 18:13.584
At least I own a trash can.

18:14.551 --> 18:17.091
At least I can legally rent a car.

18:17.092 --> 18:20.503
At least I don't live in
a loft with three other...

18:20.504 --> 18:21.546
But you live with us.

18:21.547 --> 18:23.525
But I live you with guys.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.588
Jess?

18:28.504 --> 18:29.347
We don't care

18:29.348 --> 18:30.508
if you stole your catchphrase

18:30.509 --> 18:32.503
from some low-budget
Web series.

18:32.504 --> 18:34.541
We still want to hang out.

18:38.529 --> 18:41.528
Don't trust your government, kids.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.519
My God, it's the old man from the stairs.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.571
I thought he died.

18:44.572 --> 18:46.587
Let's get out of here
before his robe opens.

18:46.588 --> 18:48.748
He's gonna get his old on you!
Get out while you can!

18:48.749 --> 18:50.583
Hey, hey, Charles,

18:50.584 --> 18:52.515
The decrepit thing that just walked by,

18:52.516 --> 18:53.531
now, that is old, okay?

18:53.532 --> 18:54.932
And you can hate him for being old,

18:54.933 --> 18:57.007
but you cannot hate me.

18:57.008 --> 18:58.288
We don't hate you for being old.

18:58.289 --> 19:00.649
We hate you 'cause you're
a viciously unbearable ass-head.

19:01.571 --> 19:02.991
Seriously?

19:03.092 --> 19:06.507
That's...
Come here, that's...

19:06.508 --> 19:07.592
Get off! Ass-head!

19:07.593 --> 19:10.591
Ass-head! Yeah!

19:10.592 --> 19:12.554
- I'm not gonna drink it all.
- Guys,

19:12.557 --> 19:14.532
I... am an ass-head.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.502
They don't hate me because I'm old.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.063
They hate me because of my personality.

19:18.064 --> 19:19.525
I can totally change my personality.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.587
Congratulations, Schmidt,
that is... that's weird news.

19:23.588 --> 19:24.561
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:24.562 --> 19:27.499
you are looking
at a brand-new man.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.533
A man who has proved

19:28.534 --> 19:30.566
so capable of talking about so little

19:30.567 --> 19:32.528
for so long...

19:32.529 --> 19:35.520
is now the producer of his very own

19:35.521 --> 19:37.528
sports talk show.

19:37.529 --> 19:38.588
- No way!
- What?!

19:38.591 --> 19:40.507
That's right.
That's right.

19:40.508 --> 19:42.508
- Yeah, baby!
- It's halftime in America!

19:42.509 --> 19:43.550
Man, that's amazing!

19:43.551 --> 19:44.831
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:45.089 --> 19:48.561
2:35 to 5:35 a.m.

19:49.562 --> 19:50.802
Boom! Prime time
for truckers!

19:52.588 --> 19:54.562
- That's awesome. He's got something.
- Yes.

19:54.565 --> 19:57.486
In other news, I just spent three days

19:57.487 --> 19:59.527
trying to impress people
who don't own bed frames.

19:59.528 --> 20:01.048
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

20:01.049 --> 20:02.129
I spent the last three days

20:02.130 --> 20:03.650
pouring urine on a grown man's sheets.

20:03.651 --> 20:06.429
Can you imagine how much we would get done

20:06.430 --> 20:07.590
if we just focused our energy

20:07.591 --> 20:09.583
onto something
a little bit more worthwhile?

20:09.584 --> 20:12.500
- Not to mention the money we would save.
- I know.

20:12.501 --> 20:13.579
Wait, what money?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.460
I mean, I've been running
the numbers on this,

20:16.461 --> 20:17.781
but, you know, I think I spent...

20:17.782 --> 20:20.524
you know, $1,200 to $1,300.

20:20.525 --> 20:22.500
- What?!
- On these pranks, yeah.

20:22.503 --> 20:24.500
- What?!
- And I was under-budget, so...

20:24.503 --> 20:25.516
Under-budget?

20:25.517 --> 20:27.401
What, you think fake
contact lenses are free?

20:27.402 --> 20:29.082
- They are not, sister.
- Nick, you don't

20:29.083 --> 20:30.043
have that kind of money.

20:30.044 --> 20:30.644
I know I don't.

20:30.645 --> 20:32.005
Where are you gonna get that from?

20:32.006 --> 20:33.606
Doesn't matter.
I had to prank Schmidt.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.550
And I did.

20:36.525 --> 20:38.524
Holy crap.

20:38.525 --> 20:40.579
- I need a real job.
- Yeah, you do.

20:42.512 --> 20:43.579
Don't you ever prank me!

20:44.580 --> 20:46.499
Of course. You got it.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.489
You'll never see it coming.

20:49.490 --> 20:51.050
This is like the end of a horror movie.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.546
Or the beginning of a pranking movie.

20:52.547 --> 20:53.707
There are no pranking movies.

20:53.708 --> 20:56.545
Yet. Get out of here.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.546
You'll never see it coming.

21:02.592 --> 21:04.095
This prescription is blurry.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.541
Hi, Schmidt.

21:06.042 --> 21:07.802
Is that you in tailored,
grown-up clothing?

21:07.803 --> 21:09.554
Yeah. Mama's gonna
ride this blazer

21:09.555 --> 21:12.508
- all the way to a tutoring job.
- Thank goodness.

21:12.509 --> 21:14.629
I almost thought I was gonna
have to loan you money.

21:14.630 --> 21:17.499
Well, I said tutoring job,
not venture capitalist.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.020
- Proud of you nonetheless.
- Thanks.

21:24.092 --> 21:25.070
What the hell?

21:25.071 --> 21:28.432
Okay. All right, Nick,
very funny.

21:28.533 --> 21:30.020
Quite the prankster you are.

21:30.521 --> 21:31.507
Ha!

21:31.508 --> 21:33.504
I'm gonna hit your ass with a ski!

21:33.505 --> 21:35.579
- Winston?
- Get some.
