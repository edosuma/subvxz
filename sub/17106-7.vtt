00:00.381 --> 00:02.352
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:02.373 --> 00:05.361
She's awesome.
Hey, she should be part of our gang.

00:07.325 --> 00:10.333
You guys should call it a day.
Don't want to mess with perfection.

00:10.353 --> 00:12.385
Again?
Yippee.

00:12.405 --> 00:15.369
If you need someone to dance with,
I've got my costume right here.

00:15.385 --> 00:17.361
No. This one's mine.

00:23.325 --> 00:25.337
It tracks all of your out-of-class
activities

00:25.353 --> 00:26.389
for maximum time management.

00:26.405 --> 00:28.385
I'm freaking you out, aren't I?

00:28.405 --> 00:31.341
You've got your whole life
mapped out in front of you.

00:31.361 --> 00:34.321
I don't even know if I want to get
into the Company or not.

00:34.337 --> 00:35.681
Wait, so you've been lying to me?

00:35.701 --> 00:37.641
You don't want to be with me
long-term?

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:23.365 --> 01:25.401
Hang on, I'm just getting
the framing right.

01:28.317 --> 01:30.361
One of the things I like
best about being a dancer

01:30.377 --> 01:33.321
is that it's choreographed.

01:33.341 --> 01:35.341
You know where you're going to be
at all times.

01:36.393 --> 01:39.321
You know I trust your camera skills
completely but...

01:42.405 --> 01:45.369
Do you think the light
might be better over there?

01:45.389 --> 01:47.401
Every moment has been workshopped

01:48.317 --> 01:49.805
to make it as perfect as possible.

01:50.321 --> 01:52.341
Imagine if life was that way.

02:02.309 --> 02:03.361
If life was choreographed,

02:03.381 --> 02:05.341
you'd say the right thing
in every situation.

02:07.325 --> 02:08.369
Everyone would be in sync.

02:08.389 --> 02:11.377
It's cluttered.
It's dynamic.

02:11.393 --> 02:13.401
Dynamic equals high distinction.

02:14.017 --> 02:15.385
Not in a choreography assessment.

02:15.405 --> 02:18.373
You want it to be less speccy,
more well-crafted.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.325
Let's go from the top.

02:21.377 --> 02:24.361
I know it's supposed to be
that the fun is in the unexpected...

02:26.345 --> 02:30.381
..but seriously, how good would it be
if someone just gave you the steps?

02:34.345 --> 02:35.389
That's better.

03:02.341 --> 03:05.401
Ah! We have to get this right.
It's due Friday!

03:08.325 --> 03:09.369
Here.

03:16.365 --> 03:19.341
So, Kat.
So, Ben.

03:19.357 --> 03:21.341
Have you been to Luna Park lately?

03:21.361 --> 03:24.361
I was thinking we should do
a Sunday dodgem session.

03:24.381 --> 03:27.389
Oooh, I'm a fiend behind the wheel.
Samuel?

03:30.385 --> 03:33.381
That big clown face out the front
gives me nightmares.

03:39.325 --> 03:41.397
You know, like a...
a date type scenario.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.401
Oh, Benjamin Tickle,
you do flatter a girl.

03:48.345 --> 03:50.341
OK. I have to get to detention.

03:51.393 --> 03:53.341
Laters.

03:57.365 --> 03:59.361
How am I supposed to impress
a girl like Kat

03:59.381 --> 04:01.381
when she's used to Myles Kelly
levels of coolness?

04:01.401 --> 04:03.361
That guy's an Icy Pole
and I'm like a...

04:03.377 --> 04:05.321
Slushie?

04:05.337 --> 04:07.321
I've got to pull out the big guns.

04:07.341 --> 04:10.309
Find something that's going to
completely blow her away.

04:10.329 --> 04:12.365
Absolutely. Right after
you've worked on ideas

04:12.421 --> 04:13.968
for our choreography assessment.

04:16.404 --> 04:19.321
Two birds, one stone.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.401
Is that where people go out
and dance in public?

04:22.321 --> 04:24.341
Flash mobbing.
It's a whole new world movement.

04:26.325 --> 04:29.341
And Kat's going to see me
as the Icy Pole I am.

04:29.361 --> 04:31.361
So she's in?
I don't know.

04:31.377 --> 04:33.321
You haven't asked her yet.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.321
But I'm guessing you won't take no
for an answer.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.401
OK! We'll start off
with a quick barre.

04:38.317 --> 04:39.381
Briefing at lunchtime.

04:48.325 --> 04:49.381
Petit battement rising.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.389
Plie, pirouettes.

04:53.405 --> 04:56.361
Balance. Arms in fifth.

04:58.325 --> 04:59.381
Tara, what was that?

04:59.401 --> 05:01.361
Instead of scurrying off
behind the shed,

05:01.377 --> 05:03.321
you should be practising.

05:13.365 --> 05:18.321
Bourree en arriere
and Tara's out of time.

05:18.341 --> 05:21.405
Pas de bourree
and Tara's missed a step.

05:22.325 --> 05:25.349
Will someone else please mess up
so I can stop picking on her?

05:29.341 --> 05:32.341
So I've had some thoughts
on our choreography assessment.

05:32.357 --> 05:35.321
Our? Grace, it's due in two days.

05:35.341 --> 05:38.321
I've been working on a solo
with Ethan.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.321
Another one?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.781
You should feel honoured
to receive a Webster care package.

05:47.405 --> 05:50.361
Swap?
No can do.

05:50.381 --> 05:53.381
Your Dad knitted this
from Tupac's wool.

05:53.397 --> 05:55.381
Tupac?

05:55.401 --> 05:58.341
I wasn't going to shear a sheep
without giving her a name.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.361
Aw...
Don't.

06:00.377 --> 06:02.321
It's not a cute thing.

06:02.341 --> 06:04.321
Don't you two have somewhere
you should be?

06:04.337 --> 06:05.401
Class, perhaps?

06:06.321 --> 06:08.397
Um, we were just discussing
our assessment piece.

06:09.313 --> 06:10.397
I'd like to see it.

06:15.385 --> 06:17.337
Wait, there's a better bit.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.029
Sorry.

06:26.049 --> 06:28.361
You're both scholarship students.
Do you know what that means?

06:28.377 --> 06:30.321
That we're a power couple?

06:31.373 --> 06:34.321
It means that your training
is being supported by benefactors

06:34.341 --> 06:36.361
who want to know
their money is being spent well.

06:36.381 --> 06:38.381
We both really appreciate
our scholarships.

06:38.401 --> 06:40.361
Besides this assessment,
your exams are next week.

06:40.381 --> 06:42.401
I see no evidence
of you appreciating anything

06:43.317 --> 06:44.349
but each other.

06:44.369 --> 06:47.405
No, we're trying to create
a dance slash life balance.

06:48.321 --> 06:49.357
Don't push me, Christian.

06:49.377 --> 06:52.373
Your friendship can wait.
Your training cannot.

06:57.345 --> 06:59.321
Miss Raine's got you freaked,
hasn't she?

06:59.337 --> 07:01.321
No. Yes.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.301
We've been distracting each other

07:03.321 --> 07:05.101
and neither of us can afford
to lose our scholarships.

07:05.170 --> 07:07.059
That's not going to happen.
Exactly.

07:07.124 --> 07:10.284
Priority one is this choreography
assessment, then the exams

07:10.381 --> 07:13.321
and after that we can just pick up
where we left off.

07:13.337 --> 07:14.381
Where was that again?

07:14.401 --> 07:17.393
Miss Raine's right.
Relationships can wait.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.361
All we're doing is just
hitting pause for a bit.

07:22.325 --> 07:23.401
Right.
See you at lunch.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.341
Hey. You right?

07:31.405 --> 07:33.361
I just got paused.

07:48.365 --> 07:51.353
There, see?
It's all there underneath.

07:51.373 --> 07:53.341
We just have to strip back
the layers.

07:54.393 --> 07:56.341
Oh, subtext.

07:56.357 --> 07:57.401
Hey, Grace.

07:58.321 --> 08:00.349
The chemistry in this room -
out of control.

08:00.365 --> 08:02.361
I actually have goose bumps.

08:02.377 --> 08:04.321
What's she talking about?

08:04.341 --> 08:06.381
I get it. You're not ready
to go public yet.

08:08.365 --> 08:10.321
My lips are sealed.

08:12.365 --> 08:14.341
OK, that was weird.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.401
She has a warped imagination.
From the jump?

08:17.317 --> 08:18.361
Yeah. Sorry.

08:21.365 --> 08:24.321
Ah, do you want some music with that?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.381
Yes.

08:35.325 --> 08:37.381
So at 2:45pm,
we alight from the train.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.361
That's right,
I did use the word 'alight'.

08:39.376 --> 08:42.321
And at 2:53, we board the ferry.

08:42.341 --> 08:47.321
And then at 3:05, the passengers
have their minds blown.

08:48.373 --> 08:50.381
Hey, um, we should practise
our piece.

08:50.401 --> 08:53.321
I thought we weren't partners
anymore.

08:53.341 --> 08:56.353
What?
You're distracting me, Tara.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.361
How about we put this on its feet?

09:01.325 --> 09:02.397
Hey, nice work, partner!

09:04.385 --> 09:08.345
Oh. Oh, this is Ben's project
as well.

09:08.361 --> 09:10.341
Yeah, what, didn't I mention that?

09:12.345 --> 09:14.321
Kat, look, I'm so glad you're here.

09:14.341 --> 09:18.361
Want to help me demonstrate?
Yeah, I'd love to.

09:24.345 --> 09:26.341
I just need you to start
a bit closer.

09:30.385 --> 09:32.353
A bit closer again.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.381
One more.

09:38.385 --> 09:41.361
OK. So we'll start
with the basic time step. Ready?

09:41.377 --> 09:43.321
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:46.405 --> 09:48.153
I blame you for this.

09:48.173 --> 09:50.377
Well, I didn't know
you were so adverse to the Benster

09:50.397 --> 09:53.341
and those puppy dog eyes.
He's just like a puppy.

09:53.361 --> 09:57.361
They keep on pestering you until you
either play with them or kick them.

09:57.381 --> 10:00.313
So you're gonna kick the puppy?
I can't kick the puppy.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.321
I'll just have to let him down
gently. Again.

10:02.341 --> 10:04.321
Who are you saving yourself for
anyway?

10:04.341 --> 10:09.321
Christian is so infuriating.
What are you doing with this?

10:09.337 --> 10:10.401
Christian gave it to me.

10:11.321 --> 10:13.321
I just don't get it.
I just don't get him.

10:13.341 --> 10:16.333
Whoa. Deep breath, T.
Uh, he said you paused him.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.361
A little pre-exam hiatus.

10:18.377 --> 10:22.361
You actually used the word 'pause'?

10:22.381 --> 10:24.361
That's like precursor
for 'you're dumped'.

10:24.377 --> 10:25.913
But that's not what I meant.

10:25.933 --> 10:27.369
Yeah, but that's what
Christian heard.

10:27.385 --> 10:30.321
He's a snow dome.

10:30.337 --> 10:32.001
We like our metaphors today.

10:32.321 --> 10:35.401
Well, actually he's the snowman
inside the snow dome.

10:37.353 --> 10:39.341
All he's had his whole life
is snow storms.

10:39.361 --> 10:41.321
You know, his mum dying,
his dad taking off.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.321
What does that have to do
with focusing on exams?

10:43.341 --> 10:45.401
For the first time,
he begins to drop his guard.

10:46.317 --> 10:47.381
And what happens?

10:47.401 --> 10:50.401
Bam! Blizzard central
all over again.

10:54.345 --> 10:55.401
Christian?

11:50.385 --> 11:53.361
Hey.
Hey.

11:56.325 --> 11:58.381
So I need a take-back
because the last thing I want

11:58.397 --> 12:00.341
is to be on pause with you.

12:00.361 --> 12:03.381
Yeah? Well, you seemed pretty sure
before.

12:06.345 --> 12:08.901
Well, sometimes it's like my brain
is on fast forward

12:08.921 --> 12:11.341
and then, you know,
I just keep thinking and thinking

12:11.361 --> 12:13.001
but instead of things
getting clearer,

12:13.017 --> 12:14.361
they just get all blurry and...

12:14.377 --> 12:16.341
You should see someone about that.

12:21.325 --> 12:22.381
Can we hit play again?

12:22.401 --> 12:25.393
Because without you
my disk just keeps skipping.

12:27.345 --> 12:29.341
Keeps skipping. Keeps skipping.

12:29.361 --> 12:33.337
Keeps skipping, skipping, skipping,
skipping, skipping...

12:33.357 --> 12:36.321
Ethan and me -
are you off your meds?

12:36.341 --> 12:38.321
Just telling it like it is.
Stop!

12:40.325 --> 12:43.321
He's earnest, shiny
and he fell for Tara,

12:43.341 --> 12:45.001
so you can add weak-minded
to the list.

12:45.321 --> 12:48.321
Well, good. I hate it when friends
disappear because of some guy.

12:48.341 --> 12:50.401
Good? We can't even be
in the same room now.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.337
I'm going to fail my assessment.
We'll whip something up.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.349
I'm thinking we can harness
my recent Joy Division obsession.

12:59.401 --> 13:01.345
What do I tell him?

13:01.365 --> 13:04.321
Wasn't he just doing you a favour?
He'll cope.

13:10.405 --> 13:12.381
So, I like your new decorating.

13:14.405 --> 13:16.361
You two looked alike.

13:18.385 --> 13:20.341
We were alike.

13:22.325 --> 13:25.361
And your dad?
Ah, let's hope not.

13:28.325 --> 13:29.901
You must think about him, though?

13:30.021 --> 13:32.369
He hung around long enough
to change a couple of nappies

13:32.385 --> 13:34.341
and then he lost interest.

13:36.365 --> 13:39.365
Do you think if he'd stuck around you
wouldn't have these rejection issues?

13:39.381 --> 13:41.341
Rejection issues?

13:42.393 --> 13:44.921
I said 'pause' and you heard 'stop'.

13:44.941 --> 13:46.381
We could talk about that
if you want...

13:46.401 --> 13:49.309
No, I think we should flick
to a new channel.

13:55.405 --> 13:57.353
Ethan?

13:58.405 --> 14:01.397
I really appreciate all your help
but this isn't going to work.

14:02.313 --> 14:03.353
Yeah, totally agree.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.381
I've been watching these clips
of an ensemble

14:05.401 --> 14:08.341
who actually play with speed rates.
It's given me a really cool idea.

14:08.357 --> 14:09.401
Come, I'll show you.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.401
Ah, Kat.

14:21.317 --> 14:22.361
Hi.

14:22.381 --> 14:26.361
Hey. Um, look, if I knew
you were stopping by,

14:26.377 --> 14:29.341
I would have, um, put on some pants.

14:32.325 --> 14:34.097
Look, I just came to say that...

14:34.117 --> 14:35.997
Thank you so much
for the flash mob feedback today.

14:36.317 --> 14:38.361
You really have a unique way
of looking at things.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.357
I do?
Yeah.

14:41.377 --> 14:45.309
It's like everything you get involved
in is suddenly five times more fun.

14:46.405 --> 14:49.365
Oh, sorry, I cut you off before.

14:49.385 --> 14:52.401
I'll bring a camera tomorrow
so we have a spare.

14:53.321 --> 14:55.329
Great.
Goodnight.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.381
OK, stop there. Now we're going
to do exactly the same movements

15:09.401 --> 15:12.381
but this time
at a slower frame rate. OK?

15:12.397 --> 15:14.341
OK.

15:15.393 --> 15:17.341
Keep it fluid.

15:18.405 --> 15:20.361
That's it.

15:30.365 --> 15:32.361
Last chance to flash mob tomorrow.
You guys in?

15:34.365 --> 15:36.321
Yeah.
Get pumped!

15:37.385 --> 15:39.401
Uh, developpe.
OK.

15:40.317 --> 15:41.353
OK?

16:06.385 --> 16:09.341
You do know it's not really Bieber
in the chat room?

16:11.365 --> 16:14.321
Have you been eating MSG again?
What?

16:14.337 --> 16:16.361
You're all flustered.

16:16.377 --> 16:18.373
It's called rehearsal. Try it.

16:24.393 --> 16:28.361
One, two, three, four, five, six.
That's it.

16:28.381 --> 16:32.361
Just practise the chory
while we wait. Has anyone seen Kat?

16:32.377 --> 16:34.389
Yay, so Joy Division.

16:35.309 --> 16:37.321
Do you think it's too much
of a hipster cliche

16:37.337 --> 16:39.341
to do something with fixies?

16:39.361 --> 16:41.381
Was that English?
Good morning.

16:45.365 --> 16:47.321
I'll tell you later.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.381
Whoa, you're cyber-stalking
Christian's dad?

16:49.397 --> 16:51.405
Shush! You were right yesterday.

16:52.325 --> 16:54.321
All of his problems
go back to his dad leaving.

16:54.341 --> 16:56.321
I thought if we could meet him,
find out why...

16:56.341 --> 16:58.313
Is it shuffle tap or tap shuffle?
Shuffle tap.

16:58.329 --> 16:59.373
Shuffle tap.

17:01.365 --> 17:04.405
Amateur psychology needs to stop.
You're worse at it than I am.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.345
Sammy, you of all people should know
how much it would help

17:07.361 --> 17:09.325
to have some family support around.

17:09.345 --> 17:12.401
OK, nice link between me
and my parental issues

17:13.320 --> 17:15.201
but they're for me to work out,
no-one else.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.340
T, promise me you're going
to drop this, OK?

17:17.357 --> 17:19.401
OK, flashers, let's get flashing.

17:20.317 --> 17:22.201
In a strictly non-nude sense.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.381
OK, so after the dance we split up
and meet back at Observatory Hill.

17:25.401 --> 17:28.361
And no flash mob chat
while we're travelling.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.381
Right. I don't want
some random blowing our cover.

17:35.345 --> 17:38.321
Tap partner with spare camera
reporting for duty.

17:41.325 --> 17:43.321
You couldn't quite kick the puppy,
could you?

17:43.337 --> 17:44.381
Shut up.

17:53.325 --> 17:58.329
This is weird but we're both
focused. We're both ambitious.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.381
Sounds hot.

17:59.401 --> 18:03.361
We could be like the new Natasha
and Sebastian of the ballet world.

18:06.345 --> 18:08.001
Did I actually just say that?

18:16.405 --> 18:18.381
Houston, we have a problem.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.381
Sorry, do I know you?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.397
The ferries are on strike.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.317
We didn't authorise that code.

18:27.337 --> 18:30.389
No, no code.
The ferries are on strike.

18:30.405 --> 18:33.353
I don't believe in fairies.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.361
The ferry boats, Ben.
They're not running.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.353
No, but the assessment's
due tomorrow.

18:37.369 --> 18:39.381
Hey, this was pretty ambitious, OK?

18:39.401 --> 18:41.401
I'm sure they won't judge
if we go any simpler.

18:43.365 --> 18:45.341
Tell Ethan to start filming now.
Quick.

18:45.361 --> 18:47.401
Here?
Just do it. Go for launch now.

20:29.365 --> 20:31.361
Did we rock that train or what?

20:31.381 --> 20:35.361
I thought the point was to surprise
the public, not your dancers.

20:38.325 --> 20:40.401
Did you see that?
I am slushie no longer.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.997
I like not fighting with you.

20:45.017 --> 20:47.353
If I do something that annoys you,
then you should tell me.

20:47.373 --> 20:51.401
I mean it. And you shouldn't
keep stuff bottled up either.

20:53.385 --> 20:55.401
Full disclosure. That could work.

20:57.405 --> 21:01.341
In that case, there's something
I need to tell you.

21:15.385 --> 21:18.321
Sorry about before.
Huh?

21:18.341 --> 21:22.317
The whole teasing you and Abigail.
Totally juvenile.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.321
Ah, don't worry about it.

21:25.373 --> 21:27.381
Projection.
Excuse me?

21:29.033 --> 21:30.381
I think that's what it's called.

21:30.401 --> 21:32.381
When you accuse someone of feeling
a certain way

21:32.401 --> 21:35.341
but it's actually you
who has those feelings.

21:40.325 --> 21:41.381
Abi, wait!

21:44.313 --> 21:45.997
So the name on the back
of the photo,

21:46.017 --> 21:48.681
I put it into the search box and
there he was - your dad.

21:50.405 --> 21:52.349
Wow.

21:52.369 --> 21:55.313
I know. I never thought
that I'd actually find him.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.321
I didn't make a friend request
or anything

21:57.341 --> 21:59.341
but you could
and then if you want to meet him,

21:59.357 --> 22:01.381
I would totally come with you...

22:01.397 --> 22:03.329
Christian?

22:06.405 --> 22:08.381
Top up?
Yeah, sure.

22:08.401 --> 22:11.341
Oh, sorry!
It's just a foot, Ben. It'll keep.

22:11.361 --> 22:14.321
It's not just any foot. Here.
Whoa, Ben. Down, boy!

22:14.341 --> 22:16.361
No, I should go rinse it.
I should go rinse it.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.401
Please! Abi!

22:20.385 --> 22:22.401
I have no idea what just happened.

22:23.317 --> 22:24.361
I was talking to Ethan,

22:24.381 --> 22:26.381
trying to suss out
what was going on with you guys

22:26.401 --> 22:28.401
and then his tongue
was down my throat...

22:29.317 --> 22:30.361
Christian!

22:30.381 --> 22:32.901
Go away, Tara. I don't want to say
something I'll regret.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.361
Well, what about full disclosure?

22:34.381 --> 22:37.341
You think you're the only one
who can Google someone?

22:37.357 --> 22:39.313
I know where my dad is!

22:39.333 --> 22:41.369
I choose not to have anything to do
with him.

22:41.389 --> 22:43.381
Why? What if meeting him
fixed things?

22:43.397 --> 22:45.361
You mean fix me?

22:45.381 --> 22:47.381
Why are you always wanting
to change me?

22:49.365 --> 22:51.381
I just want you to be happy.
No, you don't.

22:51.397 --> 22:53.349
No, you want me to be different.

22:53.369 --> 22:57.309
The pie chart, the constant pressure
about my commitment.

22:57.325 --> 22:59.105
I can't even set up a camera right!

23:00.365 --> 23:02.361
I don't need your help, Tara.

23:02.377 --> 23:04.337
I'm fine without you.

23:09.337 --> 23:11.361
I forget that
when you're choreographing a ballet,

23:11.377 --> 23:13.321
there's a rehearsal period

23:13.341 --> 23:15.961
and everyone knows which part
they're supposed to play.

23:19.341 --> 23:22.321
In life, it's easy
to over-complicate things.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.401
Or try too hard to control
other people.

23:28.353 --> 23:30.309
You OK?

23:31.365 --> 23:33.321
I'm fine.

23:35.365 --> 23:37.401
And then there's a chance
you might be left alone

23:38.317 --> 23:39.381
in your own dance

23:39.401 --> 23:42.381
where you're the only one
who knows the steps.

23:52.365 --> 23:54.341
Good, Tara.
That's showing a lot more promise.
