01:35.356 --> 01:37.227
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.272
Please, stop.
She's gonna be okay.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.795
Is it there?

01:39.838 --> 01:42.232
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.713
Loretta, you can't smoke
at a hospital!

01:44.756 --> 01:47.281
There are sick people
everywhere, and newborns!

01:48.891 --> 01:51.111
-She awake yet?
-Not yet, honey.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.155
Where's Sharon?

01:52.199 --> 01:53.374
Oh, she's getting candy.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.245
-Oh, Mom.
-Hey!

01:55.289 --> 01:56.942
-Brother from another mother.
-Hey, man.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.335
She ain't awake yet.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.684
It's gotta be okay.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.295
-Where's Sharon?
-I'm right here.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.993
-Hey, Sis.
-Oh, my God!

02:04.036 --> 02:06.648
Hey, where are my Milk Duds?

02:06.691 --> 02:08.215
I forgot.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.912
Did you get Bea a balloon?

02:09.955 --> 02:12.001
I think it has a hole in it.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.959
It's okay maybe we can
exchange it later.

02:14.003 --> 02:18.050
What? What is wrong
with you guys? Bea is in a coma.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.575
And you guys are talking
about balloons and candies.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.054
I eat when I get nervous.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.187
We never should've let her
come back here.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.058
Honey, breathe.
Honey, breathe.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.756
Yeah, breathe.
You're not helping.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.279
-She's not helping?
-You know what, Loretta?

02:29.323 --> 02:31.542
Have you ever helped?
All you do is criticize.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.196
I've always felt trapped
in this family.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.894
But this is whole other level.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.680
Usually, when I need
to get away, I go for a run.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.987
I'd give anything to be able
to do that right now.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.207
Everyone, remain calm.

02:44.251 --> 02:47.210
Alright. Thank you.

02:47.254 --> 02:50.213
Now remember, just because
Bea can't hear us

02:50.257 --> 02:51.780
doesn't mean she can't feel us.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.608
Ben's right.
We should all say a prayer.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.567
Well, that won't work,
you're Jewish.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.613
Jewish people pray too,
Loretta.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.354
Well, not like Catholics.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.920
And Bea is a Catholic.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.358
-No, I'm not.
-By blood.

03:04.401 --> 03:07.970
Loretta, would you like
to say the prayer?

03:08.013 --> 03:11.887
-Yes, I would. Thank you.
-What's the point?

03:11.930 --> 03:14.150
If there is a God,
he's the one who put me here.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.067
Heavenly Father,

03:18.110 --> 03:21.853
we humbly beseech you
to look down on our Bea

03:21.897 --> 03:24.813
and rain a holy vengeance

03:24.856 --> 03:27.642
on the goddamn motherfucker
who put her in here.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.732
God doesn't have to worry
about that.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.429
'Cause when I catch who it was

03:32.473 --> 03:34.388
I'mma beat the crap
out of him.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.303
I mean, I got a second degree
black belt.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.261
-No, he doesn't.
-We don't really know.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.610
That someone did this
to her yet.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.873
Okay, this could've been
an accident.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.962
But I don't have any memory
of that night.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.268
Was it night?

03:45.312 --> 03:47.792
Loretta, I swear to God...

03:47.836 --> 03:49.707
I told you, that won't work.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.187
Maybe I can remember what
happened

03:51.231 --> 03:52.971
if I just think real hard.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.627
Okay, new plan.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.108
Maybe I should try
retracing my steps.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.197
But where do you start
when the thing you lost

04:01.241 --> 04:02.546
is your last memory.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.205
Oh! Guess we're starting
way back.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.468
My parents couldn't wait
to have a baby.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.428
I said my parents!

04:14.471 --> 04:15.820
Hello!

04:17.909 --> 04:19.520
Now, that's obviously not them.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.218
My parents!
Mis padres.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.612
The ones who gave me life.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.658
Growing up, I was told
my parents were special.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.181
When I got old enough,

04:29.225 --> 04:31.053
I realized that's the word
adults use

04:31.096 --> 04:34.099
when someone has a disability.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.058
My dad was born
without a disability

04:36.101 --> 04:38.452
but he got hit by
a drunk driver when he was 12.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.499
After that,
his body kept growing

04:42.543 --> 04:45.807
but his mind just kind of
stayed the same.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.418
Part of my mom's brain
never fully developed.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.247
The doctors said she'd never
be able to live on her own.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.683
Who's that?

04:52.727 --> 04:55.077
Oh, the neighbors
recommended him.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.035
He looks thirsty.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.602
Can I bring him some lemonade?

04:59.995 --> 05:02.345
Oh, sure, sweetie.
That's nice.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.695
Don't let her go out there.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.089
-Why not?
-Look at her.

05:07.132 --> 05:11.136
The part of her brain that makes
her horny is still working.

05:11.180 --> 05:14.139
Earl! She just wants
to give him something to drink.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.927
The guy is in a tank top
for crying out loud.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.022
You wanna go on a date?

05:28.589 --> 05:31.461
-Sure.
-I'm Sharon.

05:31.505 --> 05:32.767
I'm Derek.

05:37.641 --> 05:40.165
Ah, where are you going?

05:40.209 --> 05:42.254
To ask my mom
if I can go on a date.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.652
I can't sleep.

05:48.696 --> 05:52.177
-Yeah, me neither.
-She should be home by now.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.397
I can't believe
you let her go out with him.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.140
Everyone says he is
a very nice young man.

05:58.183 --> 06:01.099
And she needs to be around
people her own age.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.973
She's not twenty-one
on the inside, Peg.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.716
Well, neither is Derek.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.631
How do you know?

06:10.674 --> 06:12.372
Doris McAllister told me

06:12.415 --> 06:15.505
he had a really bad head injury
when he was a boy.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.333
Doris McAllister also told you

06:17.377 --> 06:20.945
that she saw Elvis
at a Piggly Wiggly.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.774
Well, Sharon deserves this.
She deserves to be happy.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.342
I know.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.606
Don't worry.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.129
They just went out for pizza.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.262
What's the worst
that could happen?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.881
I love you, Mrs. Johnson.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.840
I love you, Mr. Johnson

06:54.979 --> 06:57.808
He gave her my mother's ring.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.375
Oh! That's nice.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.554
So, um...

07:04.598 --> 07:06.426
How-how long was your drive
up from Vegas?

07:06.469 --> 07:08.645
-Ah, too long.
-It was, it was long.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.430
Oh, I could imagine.

07:14.477 --> 07:19.047
Well, you know, I think it's
pretty clear what we need to do.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.788
I agree.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.964
-We need to get them a divorce.
-Sharon needs to be sterilized.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.226
Excuse me.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.663
I said,
"Sharon needs to be sterilized."

07:26.707 --> 07:28.186
We can't let 'em procreate.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.579
Why on earth would we do that

07:29.623 --> 07:30.841
when we can just
get them a divorce?

07:30.885 --> 07:32.626
Absolutely not.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.062
Divorce is a sin.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.238
My son's not gonna go to hell

07:36.281 --> 07:38.066
because of your trollop
of a daughter.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.676
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-Excuse me?

07:39.720 --> 07:43.288
-I said, my son's--
-Yes, I heard you. I heard you.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.900
Look, everyone.
Just calm-calm down.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.467
Yeah, calm down.
Did you hear what she said?

07:47.510 --> 07:50.600
I-I did and...she has a point.

07:50.644 --> 07:54.691
Ah, it's just I don't think
they can take care of a child.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.345
Earl, we're not getting
Sharon spayed.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.694
She's not a goddamn poodle.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.000
What choice do we have?

07:59.043 --> 08:00.567
Oh, you can get
your son neutered.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.918
-Mom! That's awful.
-Well, that's my point.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.224
Your father's the one who wants
to get your sister sterilized!

08:06.268 --> 08:07.791
Ah, I just said
we should consider it.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.489
Well, sure,
if you want to get sued.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.620
Oh, shut up, Hal.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.622
No, I'm-I'm just saying.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.798
My cousin's a lawyer.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.366
Two years ago
he worked with a woman

08:17.409 --> 08:19.542
who sued her parents
for this very thing.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.023
They took the poor folks
for all they had.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.287
Well, then, that's-that's
definitely out of the question.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.115
-We can't afford that.
-Oh, my God, dad!

08:27.158 --> 08:28.464
If that's all you care about,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.118
why don't you move
to North Korea

08:30.161 --> 08:31.902
and let the government
do it for you?

08:31.946 --> 08:33.295
'Cause I'm not
a goddamn communist!

08:33.338 --> 08:34.905
Okay, sweetie, sweetie.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.691
Maybe we're all, you know,
getting worked up over nothing.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.781
You know, maybe Derek and Sharon
aren't even interested in sex.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.530
Grandma Peg wasn't great
at predicting things.

08:52.140 --> 08:55.447
-What should we name her?
-Bambi.

08:55.491 --> 08:58.363
Now you know what Bea
is short for.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.278
Yeah, that's a sweet name.

09:01.584 --> 09:04.544
-Hi there, Bambi.
-Hi, Bambi.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.850
My mother named me after her
favorite cartoon character

09:06.894 --> 09:08.722
and my father had no idea

09:08.765 --> 09:12.595
he was increasing my chances of
becoming a stripper ten-fold.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.903
That's kind of like a metaphor
for my whole childhood.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.383
But hey,
at least we were happy.

You see, I knew something like
this was gonna happen.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.783
Oh, please.
It could happen to anybody.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.828
But you remember
that time I almost sat on Joy.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.787
I'd have squashed her
if you hadn't been there.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.876

-Oh, stop it.
-Stop what?

10:21.925 --> 10:24.058
Pretending.
This is all pretend.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.189
And they're playing house.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.669
They are not playing house.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.149
Oh, Honey, I'm home!

10:30.107 --> 10:31.500
Where have you been?

10:31.543 --> 10:33.937
-Hi, honey.
-Oh, out looking for a job.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.157
I mean, we need to
get our own place.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.507
What?
Is that my brief case?

10:40.161 --> 10:41.684
What?
It's snake skin.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.295
Derek, Derek, no one
needs to move out.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.340
Oh, yes. We do.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.863
I mean...

10:46.907 --> 10:49.605
A man needs to provide a home
for his family.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.128
Right, Earl?

10:51.172 --> 10:53.304
-Is this your idea?
-No.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.916
Look, um, tell you what, Derek,

10:55.959 --> 10:58.309
if this is what you really want,
you know, when the time comes,

10:58.353 --> 11:00.660
we'll help you find
an apartment nearby

11:00.703 --> 11:01.835
you know when
Bea is little older.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.314
No, it cannot work.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.055
There ain't any jobs
around here.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.667
And, uh, I mean,
I want to be closer to mom.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.452
So, we're going to Vegas.

11:10.495 --> 11:13.063
-No! No one is going anywhere.
-Relax.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.805
You're not taking
Sharon to Vegas.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.459
Because you do not know
what's best for her.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.679
-Yes, I do.
-I can get a job at Hooters.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.724
-Good idea.
-No, you can't.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.466
You can't. You cannot take care
of Bea by yourself.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.730
Yes, I can. Bambi is my baby.
She is not yours.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.514
I know that, sweetheart.
I know, I know. Careful.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.734
You know what,
we don't need your help anymore

11:31.778 --> 11:33.736
or-or anyone else's.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.477
I can take care
of my own family.

11:37.479 --> 11:38.959
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.006
Why didn't you say something?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.617
I told you,
I'm not raising another kid.

11:45.661 --> 11:48.229
We've been raising Sharon
for 21 years.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.447
How can you be so selfish?

11:49.491 --> 11:51.014
Oh, get off your high horse.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.537
You knew, it was gonna
end up like this.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.756
What?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.845
You're the one that said
Sharon can date.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.934
You're the one who said
she can have babies.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.197
-I'm the one who tried to stop.
-I wanted her to have a--

12:00.241 --> 12:01.503
You wanted her out!

12:01.546 --> 12:03.200
I don't have a lot...
Oh, my God!

12:03.244 --> 12:04.767
How can you say that to me?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.073
-Well, listen.
-How can you say that to me?

12:06.116 --> 12:08.162
Don't make me the bad guy.

12:08.205 --> 12:11.252
Because I know
you feel relieved too.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.359
Hello?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.318
Are you Loretta Johnson?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.711
Oh, Lord, no.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.019
Okay, Peg Addleman?

12:39.062 --> 12:42.413
McDonald, I went back
to my maiden name.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.764
-Noted.
-And you are?

12:44.807 --> 12:46.461
I'm Mary.
Bea's social worker.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.332
What is she doing here?

12:48.376 --> 12:49.769
-Oh!
-Yes.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.771
Why-why does Bea have
a social worker?

12:51.814 --> 12:55.383
It's routine when minors
come in with injuries.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.342
I do my report and provide it
to the proper authorities.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.779
What do they think happened?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.519
Well, they think
it's likely an accident.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.957
What do you think?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.524
No, I just want to make sure
there's nothing else to it.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.008
I actually met Bea before.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.619
Seven years ago,
after the car accident.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.970
Ugh, they made
such a big deal out of that.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.363
That-that was just
a big misunderstanding.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.104
It's okay.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.932
I'm actually more interested
in what happened yesterday.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.500
Please, have a seat.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.197
Um, it's okay
that we do it here?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.895
I-I don't wanna leave Bea.

13:28.938 --> 13:33.464
Everybody else went home
to rest and change and...

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
But you stayed.

13:35.553 --> 13:39.383
Well, somebody had to.
And-and I-I wanted to.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.213
My-my ex-husband
was supposed to show up

13:43.257 --> 13:45.085
and he could've stayed
but you know...

13:45.128 --> 13:46.521
Surprise, surprise!

13:48.349 --> 13:50.612
Ex-husband.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.527
I-I don't know
how much help I'll be.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.311
I was in California yesterday

13:54.355 --> 13:56.705
that's where I live.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.315
That's okay. Um...

13:58.359 --> 14:00.361
Actually, I-I'd like to get
a bigger picture

14:00.404 --> 14:02.189
of Bea's life.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.843
For example...

14:03.886 --> 14:06.933
has she been getting along
with her parents lately?

14:06.976 --> 14:09.849
Oh, Derek and Sharon
had nothing to do with this.

14:09.892 --> 14:13.591
I'm not saying that,
that they do. Just, um...

14:13.635 --> 14:16.420
I know, Bea's childhood was
somewhat non-traditional.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.075
Oh, my God, You live in a van
with your parents one time

14:19.119 --> 14:20.947
and they never let it go.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.429
I mean, it was a nice van.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.823
Dad said the only time
he took money from grandpa

14:27.867 --> 14:29.172
was to buy it.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.262
♪ Here I go again

14:32.306 --> 14:35.526
♪ On my own

14:35.570 --> 14:40.749
♪ Goin' down the only road

14:40.792 --> 14:42.882
We moved into
this really neat community

14:42.925 --> 14:45.580
where my parents
could just be themselves.

14:45.623 --> 14:46.886
Look at this place.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.540
-Wow! Yeah.
-Huh?

14:49.584 --> 14:52.761
I think it was the first time
my mom had real friends.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.589
So, there was always someone
to watch me

14:54.632 --> 14:56.460
while my parents
went to look for jobs.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.698
When no one wanted
to hire my dad...

15:16.741 --> 15:18.178
he made his own opportunity.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.572
Say what you want
about my parents

15:21.616 --> 15:25.272
but when they actually commit
to doing something, they do it.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.942
Dad said living in that van
was the happiest we ever were.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.596
But he wanted us
to have a real home.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.642
And eventually,
we moved into one.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.125
Huh?

15:54.692 --> 15:57.434
Dad told me
we were happy in the van,

15:57.478 --> 16:00.524
but I remember being
really happy in the house.

16:02.483 --> 16:06.400

16:08.706 --> 16:11.622

17:08.070 --> 17:11.595
I liked that my parents trusted
me to take care of myself.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.815
Until they started trusting me
to do everything.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.252
I don't see
why this is so hard.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.732
I mean, okay.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.951
Look, next time
when you press the gas--

17:19.995 --> 17:22.215
-What are you doing?
-You said, "Press the gas."

17:22.258 --> 17:23.477
-I wasn't done!
-Don't yell at me!

17:23.520 --> 17:25.348
-I'm not yelling!
-Yes, you are.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.092
I don't wanna do this anymore.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.616
You said it would be fun
and it's not fun!

17:32.660 --> 17:34.357
You gotta learn to drive.

17:34.401 --> 17:35.576
I'm ten.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.581
What if there's an emergency
and I can't drive?

17:42.365 --> 17:43.584
What kind of emergency?

17:46.761 --> 17:50.199
I don't know.
What if my leg fell off?

17:51.287 --> 17:53.333
Or I drank too many beers?

17:53.376 --> 17:54.682
Why can't mom drive?

17:57.293 --> 17:59.817
Because your mama can't get
a license, that's why.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.216
Is that because she's retarded?

18:09.305 --> 18:10.915
Who told you that?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.221
Esther did.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.833
She told everyone at school.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.620
Your mama is not retarded.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.672
Are you retarded?

18:28.716 --> 18:31.110
No! Ain't nobody retarded!

18:43.339 --> 18:44.688
Look, if you...

18:45.820 --> 18:47.735
if you learn to drive...

18:51.042 --> 18:52.783
I'll get you
anything you want.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.704
Anything?

19:02.358 --> 19:05.144
Godzilla, sit.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.537
Good boy.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.713
Good boy.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.281
Okay, now let's tr...

19:13.761 --> 19:15.371
-Let's try "Stay."
-Bambi!

19:16.372 --> 19:18.331
My name is Bea!

19:18.374 --> 19:21.682
-Bea!
-What? I'm busy.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.684
Your mom needs help
getting dressed for work!

19:24.467 --> 19:25.773
Come on!

19:25.816 --> 19:26.991
Okay.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.646
Thanks.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.648
Let's go get mommy ready
for work.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.611
Where're you going?

19:37.654 --> 19:40.179
The track.
Bob's picking me up.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.529
But it's Saturday.

19:42.572 --> 19:46.185
Well, I'm not working.
I'm racing.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.056
What about my soccer game?

19:48.099 --> 19:50.189
Well, I'll come next weekend.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.758
Bye, Bea.

19:58.936 --> 20:01.200
Mom, what are you doing?

20:01.243 --> 20:02.505
Have you brushed your teeth?

20:02.549 --> 20:03.941
Yeah.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.116
Then why aren't you dressed?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.857
I'm getting a snack first.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.295
No, you're gonna be late
and you can't get fired again

20:09.338 --> 20:11.601
because dad's truck
isn't enough.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.126
Godzilla, leave it.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.813
Okay, let's go get dressed.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.254
Come on, Mom. I'll walk you to
the bus on the way to my game.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.432
Godzilla?

20:59.475 --> 21:00.650
Godzilla!

21:03.740 --> 21:05.873
Mom, did you go outside?

21:05.916 --> 21:08.528
Yeah. I wanted to see
if it was sunny out.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.225
Why didn't you just
look out a window?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.662
Godzilla!

21:14.360 --> 21:15.752
Godzilla!

21:19.278 --> 21:21.236
This is definitely an emergency.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.387
So, you have no idea
how this happened?

21:43.345 --> 21:44.999
Nope.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.479
You weren't driving?

21:47.610 --> 21:48.829
Lady, I'm ten.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.660
Did your dad tell you to lie?

21:53.703 --> 21:55.052
He definitely did.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.054
No.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.150
Can I see my dog now?

22:07.804 --> 22:10.416
You can get Godzilla back
when we're done.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.769
I don't want him back.

22:17.379 --> 22:21.035
Really? After you crashed
a car trying to find him?

22:21.078 --> 22:22.645
I told you. That wasn't me.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.391
I wanna say goodbye.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.222
I can't take care of him
and my mom.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.748
It's natural for a big sister

22:38.792 --> 22:40.533
to feel protective
of her little sister.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.404
And for an aunt to feel
protective of her niece.

22:42.448 --> 22:46.626
I think I just feel that
a little more intensely.

22:46.669 --> 22:47.931
Um...

22:47.975 --> 22:51.587
So, when Bea was born

22:51.631 --> 22:53.981
we wondered
if it wouldn't be better

22:54.024 --> 22:56.418
for everyone if we took her in.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.768
Right, right, but then we got
pregnant with the twins

22:58.812 --> 23:00.901
and, you know, as you
can imagine, our hands full.

23:00.944 --> 23:04.078
And Sharon was so good with Bea
when she was a baby.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.775
-She was, surely was.
-But...

23:05.819 --> 23:07.777
After the...

23:09.562 --> 23:13.087
car incident,
we revisited the idea

23:13.130 --> 23:15.655
and Bea came to stay
with us for the summer.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.225
Slice this up for you, buddy.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.184
Hey, good work
on the avocado toast by the way.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.707
-Thanks.
-It's good, right?

23:24.751 --> 23:27.188
Fruit's fresh today,
I love this farmer's market.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.798
Alright, here you go.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.800
So good.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.323
I, I know it's further

23:32.367 --> 23:35.109
but I'm gonna
go to this one the next time.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.633
Oh, those blueberries
are fantastic.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.244
These are organic and they're
like a, they're beautiful.

23:40.288 --> 23:43.030
So, like super concentrated
super--

23:43.073 --> 23:44.640
What's wrong with you guys?

23:46.686 --> 23:48.862
-Bea, why would you ask that?
-All the medicine.

23:48.905 --> 23:52.605
Oh! Honey, those are vitamins.
Would you like some?

23:52.648 --> 23:54.041
We don't want you to get sick
and there's been some

23:54.084 --> 23:56.522
really yucky stuff going around.

23:56.565 --> 23:57.827
I'm good.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.002
-Mom?
-Mm-hmm.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.830
Do I have tennis practice today?

24:00.874 --> 24:04.791
No. You have tutoring
and then therapy.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.228
Ow! Ow! I cut myself!

24:07.271 --> 24:08.490
Oh, alright.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.013
Is it bad?
Let me see.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.189
That's why we do it for you,
buddy.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.366
-Have to see the damage.
-Mama's on it.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.151
-How is it?
-Oh, it's a good one.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.719
-Yeah, is that a real one now?
-You're gonna be okay, look.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.851
-Your boo-boo buddy.
-That felt better?

24:21.895 --> 24:23.462
You'll be just fine.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.813
What's for dessert?

24:26.856 --> 24:28.815
We don't do dessert
for breakfast.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.381
Well, that fucking blows.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.217
Okay, um, you know what, Bea,

24:40.261 --> 24:41.958
I think we gotta talk about
some ground rules.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.264
Okay?

24:43.307 --> 24:45.658
So, we don't use foul language.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.790
We cover our mouth
when we belch.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.358
And in this house, kiddo,

24:50.401 --> 24:51.664
we wear pants at the table.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.317
I'm letting my boys breathe.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.844
Okay.
Why don't you guys go out?

24:57.887 --> 24:59.149
You guys are done, right?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.064
Let's go out and play.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.371
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, mom!

25:03.414 --> 25:05.982
And be careful on the steps,
please.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.810
Those steps are too steep.

25:07.854 --> 25:10.378
She's like a feral dog.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.901
-Ben!
-What?

25:11.945 --> 25:14.164
Y-you know what I found
her doing the other day?

25:14.208 --> 25:16.210
She was using Oreos
to train the boys

25:16.253 --> 25:17.864
to fetch the remote for her.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.999
You guys wanna go swimming?

25:23.043 --> 25:24.348
We're not allowed to swim alone.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.436
-Yeah.
-You're not alone.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.090
You're with me.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.657
Come on!
I know you want to.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.619
Please just try to
connect with her?

25:33.662 --> 25:37.666
I have. I really have.
I even gave her my lucky hat.

25:37.710 --> 25:41.061
Aww. You've had that hat
since college. That's so sweet.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.411
It's incredibly sweet.
Yeah, you know what she did?

25:43.454 --> 25:45.935
She threw it in her bag
and then flipped me off

25:45.979 --> 25:48.938
when I told her that
she couldn't borrow the car

25:48.982 --> 25:51.811
Bea, are you okay? Bea!

25:51.854 --> 25:54.596
Mom, dad, it's Bea.
Come quick!

25:54.640 --> 25:55.989
-She can't swim.
-Bea, I'm coming.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.687
-She can't swim.
-Hold on!

25:58.731 --> 26:00.167
Hey!

26:02.299 --> 26:04.780
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-I got you. I got you.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.956
-Are you okay? Oh, my God!
-You okay? You okay?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.089
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:09.132 --> 26:12.527
Bea, Bea, that was
incredibly dangerous.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.833
You understand me?
You could've drowned.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.096
-Ben? Ben?
-What were you thinking?

26:16.139 --> 26:17.271
-Huh?
-Ben?

26:17.314 --> 26:18.402
Uncle Ben, I...

26:18.446 --> 26:20.143
-What?
-Honey, it's okay.

26:20.187 --> 26:21.492
What?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.626
Okay.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.062
After I almost drowned

26:26.106 --> 26:28.151
my uncle did a total 180.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.849
It like, broke his brain

26:29.892 --> 26:31.677
that I had never been
taught how to swim.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.636
Or been to Disneyland
or had a piece of broccoli.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.160
He always convinced that
he and my aunt could save me

26:37.204 --> 26:38.640
from my sad childhood

26:38.684 --> 26:40.642
like they had saved me
from that pool.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.296
I got ya.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.907
Okay.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.169
I'm gonna call her.

26:50.347 --> 26:52.523
Bea coming to live with us
is the right thing.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.744
-Absolutely. Absolutely.
-Yeah.

26:55.788 --> 26:58.051
It's all about
how you present it.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.835
I'm sure your sister's gonna
understand.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.054
Yeah.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.411
Turns out, my mom didn't.

27:10.454 --> 27:14.197
She called 9-1-1 and told them
someone was trying to steal me.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.764
I over heard my aunt
tell the cops

27:15.808 --> 27:19.289
she just wanted me
to have a normal life.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.857
For my aunt and uncle,
that meant private school.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.859
Plank's constant is equal to

27:23.903 --> 27:27.428
6.63 times 10 to
the negative 34 joule seconds.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.735
At first, my dad refused
the tuition money.

27:29.778 --> 27:32.346
but Grandma Loretta
made him accept.

27:32.389 --> 27:34.087
She figured if I got
knocked up in high school

27:34.130 --> 27:37.873
like she did, at least
it would be by a rich kid.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.049
Bea, I'm still waiting
on those college applications.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.748
I know, I know,
never leave that till tomorrow

27:42.791 --> 27:46.055
what you can do today.
I'm on it, Mr. V.

27:46.099 --> 27:48.754
While my family was busy
worrying about my future

27:48.797 --> 27:51.104
I was just trying to
balance work, school

27:51.147 --> 27:52.801
and caring for my parents.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.977
There I was.

27:55.021 --> 27:58.154
You know, I was like
in the middle of the road.

27:58.198 --> 28:02.071
You know, like, half dead.

28:02.115 --> 28:06.510
And, uh, I was,
I was looking up at the sun.

28:07.947 --> 28:11.515
But, uh,
it-it-it wasn't the sun.

28:11.559 --> 28:15.258
No. It was the light.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.783
-It's true. He saw the light.
-Yeah.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.175
Yeah.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.264
Then when I woke up

28:21.308 --> 28:24.833
part of the car was, uh,
was on top of me

28:24.877 --> 28:27.140
and I just, felt it.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.707
I just, you know, I'm muscle.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.318
That thing
and I-I just threw it off.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.016
'Cause, you know,
even since I was a kid

28:34.060 --> 28:38.629
I was built like a,
you know, brick crap house.

28:41.241 --> 28:43.983
I don't know what this
has to do with my question.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.032
Well, you asked me...

28:50.076 --> 28:54.341
why I am not scared
or-or sad about Bea.

28:56.473 --> 28:57.910
That's because...

28:58.911 --> 29:00.695
you know, that day...

29:02.218 --> 29:04.655
Jesus told me
he had my back.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.138
And-and my Bea,
she's a part of me,

29:09.182 --> 29:11.401
so...

29:11.445 --> 29:13.099
you know,
he's got her back, too.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.230
Amen.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.318
That's me.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.451
A real child of God.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.670
Good evening and God bless.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.282
I'm selling tickets
for my school's fund raiser.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.806
The winner gets two tickets
to see Celine Dion

29:24.850 --> 29:26.808
and whoever sells the most
raffle tickets

29:26.852 --> 29:29.768
gets to go on our senior trip
to Disneyland for free.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.118
So, it's a win-win really.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.431
Hi, I'm selling raffle tickets
are you interested?

29:41.475 --> 29:43.738
-I'm interested in some band.
-They're for Celine Dion.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.696
And they are five dollars
for one raffle ticket.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.220
-Maybe we can go together?
-No.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.439
-No? Hey! I was gonna sell--
-What?

29:49.483 --> 29:50.789
There are like
a million pedophiles.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.182
Thanks. Sorry.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.798
I'm so sorry.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.366
This is all my fault.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.940
Are you Bea's doctor?

30:11.984 --> 30:16.205
No. I'm from child
and family services.

30:16.249 --> 30:19.513
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to Bea.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.341
Do you mind
if we talk for a second?

30:26.302 --> 30:28.609
So, Bea didn't tell you
where she was going?

30:28.652 --> 30:29.784
Nope.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.744
Feeling nervous.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.442
Nope.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.660
Guilty?

30:36.704 --> 30:39.489
No. Why would I feel guilty?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.143
Oh, I heard you tell Bea

30:41.187 --> 30:42.797
that you thought
it was all your fault.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.625
No, I didn't.

30:44.668 --> 30:47.193
Okay. I must've misheard.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.849
One more question.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.328
Does Bea drink?

30:52.372 --> 30:55.201
A little bit
too much sometimes?

30:55.244 --> 30:56.898
I'm not here
to get her in trouble but...

30:58.682 --> 31:00.380
she had quite a bit of
alcohol in her system

31:00.423 --> 31:01.468
when she was admitted and--

31:01.511 --> 31:03.078
No, no, no,
that's impossible.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.297
Bea doesn't drink.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.864
Her dad was hit
by a drunk driver

31:05.907 --> 31:07.691
so she was like,
totally against it.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.568
So, what do you all
do for fun?

31:14.611 --> 31:16.396
I don't know. Hang out.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.443
Any place in particular?

31:23.969 --> 31:25.927
I told you to wear
something warmer.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.974
Well, this outfit get helps me
get all the rich pedos.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.801
Can we please just go home?

31:30.845 --> 31:33.282
What? No. I have...
I barely sold any tickets.

31:33.326 --> 31:36.024
So, what?
Why do you care so much?

31:36.068 --> 31:38.635
Well, I heard Esther Lawrence
tell everyone at lunch

31:38.679 --> 31:40.420
that no one could sell more
tickets than her

31:40.463 --> 31:42.422
and I want everyone to know
what a lying bitch she is.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.946
-And then I want her to die.
-Bea!

31:44.990 --> 31:46.556
Okay, I don't want her to die.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.254
I just want her to get
chlamydia.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.344
What?
It's totally curable.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.215
She's probably already
had it before.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.000
Are you ever gonna
get over it?

31:55.043 --> 31:56.566
Nia, she called you
Kim Jong-un

31:56.610 --> 31:57.785
in front of
the whole football team.

31:57.828 --> 31:58.873
Yeah, thank you. I remember.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.005
I was there.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.228
Ugh, I'm gonna be late...

32:06.272 --> 32:07.403
for work.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.016

That singer is gay.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.550
-Oh, did you?
-Mm-hmm.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.988
What? It's true.
I saw it on bar's Facebook.

34:38.032 --> 34:41.818
Uh-huh. Yeah, and why do you
care if they're gay?

34:44.038 --> 34:45.561

Well, you know what I heard?

34:56.833 --> 35:01.708
I heard that your precious
Judge Judy is gay.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.580
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

35:19.726 --> 35:20.857
So am I.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.645
You seriously told them that?

35:25.688 --> 35:29.083
Yeah, you should've seen the
look on their faces.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.129
You wanna trade your apple
for my Ho-Ho's?

35:36.308 --> 35:39.311
Bea, we're in the same
astronomy class.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.182
Okay.

35:41.226 --> 35:44.185
I, ah, I noticed
you fell asleep.

-You were watching me sleep?
-No.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.278
I just, ah,
I thought, if you wanted,

35:50.322 --> 35:52.367
you could borrow my notes
from today.

35:52.411 --> 35:53.368
Oh.

35:56.545 --> 35:57.503
Thanks.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.597
You might as well be a lesbian.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.989
What's that supposed to mean?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.991
You just blew off Ethan Rivers.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.471
Who is Ethan Rivers?

36:09.515 --> 36:11.952
He moved here last week.
Everyone's talking about it.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.259
His parents own like all
the porta potties in Nevada.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.870
Oh, well, excuse me
for not dropping

36:16.913 --> 36:18.915
my panties right here
in the cafeteria.

36:18.959 --> 36:23.093
They say he had cancer as a kid.
Testicular.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.225
Heard he only has one ball.

36:25.357 --> 36:27.576
Really? One ball?

36:27.620 --> 36:29.448
With a smile like that,
who needs two?

36:30.536 --> 36:32.581
Huh.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.453
You think he'll be
at Esther's party?

36:34.496 --> 36:37.238
Youwant to go to
Esther's party?

36:37.282 --> 36:41.286
-So?
-I don't think we're invited.

36:41.329 --> 36:44.158
Well, you don't need
an invitation

36:44.202 --> 36:45.594
if you bring alcohol.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.684
How are we going to get alcohol?

36:50.556 --> 36:51.818
We're gonna get caught.

36:51.861 --> 36:52.993
Well, if we do, it's because

36:53.036 --> 36:55.865
you're drawing attention
to yourself.

36:55.909 --> 36:59.260
I'm sorry! I sweat when
I'm about to get arrested!

36:59.304 --> 37:01.567
We're not gonna get arrested.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.395
My mom is way over 21.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.396
It's fine.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.576
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.509
-Hi.
-Hey.

37:30.552 --> 37:34.339
-You wanna see my ID?
-No, I'm okay.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.340
Okay.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.693
-I like candy.
-It's good.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.999
If this works,
we will literally be

37:43.043 --> 37:45.350
the most popular people
at this party.

37:45.393 --> 37:46.916
That will be $29.70.

37:50.616 --> 37:54.054
Thank you. Oh, that's enough.

37:57.753 --> 38:00.190
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:00.234 --> 38:03.629
Your mom is awesome. I mean,
your house must be so fun.

38:03.672 --> 38:07.937
You get to eat whatever you
want, watch whatever you want,

38:07.981 --> 38:09.983
go to bed whenever you want.

38:11.811 --> 38:13.334
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.336
Your mom rocks.

38:20.863 --> 38:21.951
Okay! Be cool.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.392
What are you guys doing here?

38:27.435 --> 38:28.915
I just want you to know,
I totally forgot

38:28.958 --> 38:31.178
all about the time
you called me Kim Jong-il.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.832
It was Kim Jong-un.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.269
And this is kind of
an intimate gathering,

38:35.313 --> 38:38.359
so I'm gonna have to
ask you guys to leave.

38:38.403 --> 38:41.754
Huh, it's fine.
We'll leave.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.409
But we're taking our
beer with us.

38:44.452 --> 38:46.541
Yeah. And our hard seltzer.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.762
Ugh. Whatever.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.639
Tanaka's in the house!

38:57.683 --> 39:00.381
She pulled up with the drink.

39:00.425 --> 39:03.079
Babe, I told you she was cool.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.168
Here, let's get this on ice.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.786
Ooh. This is my nightmare.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.962
Hey, hey, what's your name?

39:16.005 --> 39:18.225
Uh, not interested.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.227
Wow, that's a very beautiful
name. Mine's Ty--

39:20.270 --> 39:22.316
Esther's older brother
who creeps around

39:22.360 --> 39:24.536
her high school parties because
he can't get laid in college.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.538
-Yeah. Oh, wow.
-Okay. I get laid plenty.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.235
-Well... good for you. Okay.
-Yeah.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.063
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay. Yeah.

39:30.106 --> 39:31.412
And, just let me know
when you get bored

39:31.456 --> 39:32.413
with all that
high school bullshit.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.856
What's going on?

39:40.900 --> 39:43.424
Apparently, Ethan told Andy that
he has a super strong stream

39:43.468 --> 39:45.383
and can literally pee over
the top of his Land Rover.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.689
So Andy bet him a hundred bucks
he couldn't. He's so funny.

39:50.823 --> 39:51.780
Whoo!

39:53.826 --> 39:56.481
Let's fucking go, dude!

39:56.524 --> 39:59.048
-Pay up!
-Okay, uh...

39:59.092 --> 40:02.008
-Seen enough of that.
-Okay.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.403
Hey, Bea. Over here.

40:07.579 --> 40:10.408
Hey. What's up?

40:10.451 --> 40:12.584
So, I have this problem I
thought you could help me with.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.935
See, I sold a ton of raffle
tickets for the fund raiser.

40:15.978 --> 40:18.894
Like, there's no way
anyone can catch up.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.809
And what's the problem?

40:20.853 --> 40:23.464
Well, I'm just so blessed

40:23.508 --> 40:25.074
that I didn't need
the free trip to Disney.

40:25.118 --> 40:26.511
So, I thought I could give it

40:26.554 --> 40:32.125
to someone less
fortunate...like you.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.741
-Excuse me.
-I made her cry.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.576
Oh.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.577
You scared me.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.059
Something wrong?

40:54.626 --> 40:59.065
Um, I think my cancer
might have come back.

40:59.108 --> 41:03.504
I just started bleeding
everywhere and, um...

41:03.548 --> 41:04.636
I don't really know
what's happening--

41:04.679 --> 41:06.768
Hey, hey, hey. We gotta...

41:06.812 --> 41:08.509
We gotta get you to a hospital.

41:08.553 --> 41:12.078
Yeah. I'll-I'll drive you.
Come on, okay. Come here.

41:13.122 --> 41:14.733
What are you doing?

41:14.776 --> 41:17.910
I want you to know what
it feels like to be a girl.

41:19.346 --> 41:22.262
There you go. Come on. Let's go.

41:28.573 --> 41:32.185
You know, it's-it's just
totally, it's not a big deal.

41:33.926 --> 41:34.883
What's not?

41:36.755 --> 41:38.931
Only having one-one ball.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.456
It is when everyone else
has two.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.633
Uh... Normally,
people have two, yes.

41:45.677 --> 41:47.896
Uh, that is true, normally.

41:47.940 --> 41:52.335
Um. But-but, who wants to
be normal, anyway, right?

41:52.379 --> 41:54.163
That's, that's boring.

41:55.991 --> 41:58.254
You think it would be boring
if I had two testicles?

41:58.298 --> 42:00.996
N-no, no, no, um...

42:01.040 --> 42:04.609
Uh, my.. Well, yeah. I mean
I-I-I don't know. Maybe kind of.

42:04.652 --> 42:09.048
It's just my point, my point
is that, it is not a big deal.

42:09.091 --> 42:13.095
To me. I don't-I don't care.
That's-that's all.

42:13.139 --> 42:15.402
This is not a big...
Don't even worry about it.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.883
It's not a big deal.
Pretty much.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.453
-Really it's not...
-Can we not talk?

42:32.288 --> 42:33.855
Mr. Rivers?

42:33.899 --> 42:35.857
I will give you two
some privacy.

42:35.901 --> 42:38.251
No, um, please don't.

42:40.775 --> 42:43.822
-Wonderful. May I continue?
-Ah, yes.

42:43.865 --> 42:48.043
Double wonderful. All your tests
came back normal.

42:48.087 --> 42:50.524
I suggest you follow up
with your oncologist,

42:50.568 --> 42:53.440
but I have no reason to believe
your cancer is back.

42:53.483 --> 42:54.746
What about all the blood?

42:54.789 --> 42:57.226
Looks like a case
of prostatitis.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.664
-Is that bad?
-It's not ideal.

42:59.707 --> 43:02.362
But it just means you
irritated your prostate.

43:02.405 --> 43:04.451
It can be caused by anything
from kidney stones

43:04.494 --> 43:05.844
to urinating too hard.

43:07.672 --> 43:09.456
What?

43:09.499 --> 43:12.590
Um, nothing. Nothing,
it's-it's fine.

43:12.633 --> 43:16.724
A guy bet him that he couldn't
pee over his car. So he did.

43:18.726 --> 43:20.554
How do I stop the bleeding?

43:20.598 --> 43:23.557
I suggest you start peeing in
toilets, like the rest of us.

43:27.474 --> 43:31.652
-I'm an absolute idiot.
-No, no.

43:31.696 --> 43:35.525
You know I gotta say,
you don't seem the "bro" type.

43:35.569 --> 43:37.876
But why would you get in
a literal pissing contest

43:37.919 --> 43:39.007
with Andy Reynolds?

43:41.488 --> 43:44.317
Making friends when you're new.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.972
I guess I'd rather be the guy

43:47.015 --> 43:50.279
who could pee over a car instead
of the guy with one ball.

43:50.323 --> 43:52.934
Yeah, I get it.

43:52.978 --> 43:55.197
You can't tell anybody
about all this.

43:55.241 --> 43:58.200
-You know that, right?
-I won't. I promise.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.201
Pinky swear?

44:00.333 --> 44:01.290
Pinky swear.

44:14.477 --> 44:15.435
Jesus!

44:16.479 --> 44:18.917
No. Just Loretta.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.877
- Are you the boyfriend?
- Uh...yeah.

44:26.751 --> 44:28.230
You're hiding something.

44:30.711 --> 44:32.844
-No, I'm not.
-Please!

44:32.887 --> 44:36.151
Loretta knows
when a man's lying to her.

44:36.195 --> 44:38.371
Ooh, except my second husband.

44:38.414 --> 44:41.722
But he was a sociopath,
diagnosed and everything.

44:41.766 --> 44:45.465
A real Ted Bundy type, but more
handsome. Know what I mean?

44:48.947 --> 44:50.035
Bea and I broke up.

44:51.732 --> 44:53.560
Wait a minute.

44:53.603 --> 44:54.953
Are your parents rich?

44:56.998 --> 44:57.956
Um...

44:59.435 --> 45:01.829
Y-yeah, yeah.

45:01.873 --> 45:04.353
In that case,
take my advice.

45:04.397 --> 45:07.313
Say you're sorry.
Whatever you did.

45:08.923 --> 45:11.143
Oh... okay.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.885
Thank you, Loretta.

45:19.412 --> 45:22.545
Ms. Johnson.
Can I talk to you?

45:22.589 --> 45:24.460
Am I gonna be interrogated now?

45:24.504 --> 45:26.941
Oh, no. No, it's
not an interrogation.

45:26.985 --> 45:30.902
Uh, I'd been there before.
It wouldn't be my first.

45:30.945 --> 45:34.470
I was framed once, when I was
singing at the Nugget.

45:34.514 --> 45:36.777
Oh. You sang
at the Golden Nugget?

45:36.821 --> 45:38.910
The Nevada Nugget in Reno.

45:41.216 --> 45:44.524
If it weren't for that
Burt Bacharach telling everyone

45:44.567 --> 45:46.918
I was passing bad checks...

45:48.006 --> 45:49.224

Actually, I-I'm good.

46:25.173 --> 46:27.828
But I would like to talk
to Bea's boyfriend.

46:27.872 --> 46:29.874
-Who?
-Bea has a boyfriend?

46:37.055 --> 46:39.231

Well, it is when you don't have
to pay for the Disney trip

49:19.347 --> 49:20.479
you begged me to go on.

49:20.522 --> 49:22.133
I can pay for Disney.

-It's not even a big deal.
-I'm not helpless, Ethan.

49:26.006 --> 49:27.529
Accepting help doesn't
make you helpless.

49:27.573 --> 49:29.967
Oh, wow.
That was deep.

49:32.447 --> 49:34.536

49:52.032 --> 49:56.080
Ahh! Please tell me
you didn't wear those in public.

49:56.123 --> 49:58.212
Well, what's wrong
with our outfits?

49:58.256 --> 50:01.215
Well, blowing past the fact that
you're both wearing sweat-suits.

50:01.259 --> 50:03.043
Mom's is an appropriation.

50:03.087 --> 50:05.872
And-and yours is
completely chauvinistic.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.354
I thought they were funny.

50:12.270 --> 50:15.273
Um, okay, um, I'll get that.

50:20.147 --> 50:24.064
Hi. Um,
What-what are you doing here?

50:24.108 --> 50:28.068
I came to apologize.
And I figured you'd be hungry.

50:28.112 --> 50:30.940
Oh, well, apology accepted.

50:30.984 --> 50:34.205
And I will see you
at school tomorrow.

50:34.248 --> 50:36.337
I didn't mean to make
you feel bad earlier.

50:38.252 --> 50:40.124
I don't feel bad.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.604
I just, you know,
feel different.

50:42.648 --> 50:46.304
My life is different than yours.

50:46.347 --> 50:48.132
Is that why you never
want me to come over?

50:48.175 --> 50:49.176
Yes.

50:49.220 --> 50:51.439
No. No.

50:51.483 --> 50:54.355
It's okay. Everyone's
embarrassed by their parents.

50:58.316 --> 51:00.100
-Hi!
-Hi!

51:00.144 --> 51:01.710
-Hey.
-Come on in, man.

51:01.754 --> 51:03.103
I'm Ethan.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.800
-I'm Sharon.
-Good to meet you guys.

51:04.844 --> 51:07.586
-Everyone, say hi.
-Sorry, there's a lot of pizzas.

51:13.157 --> 51:15.289
The man brought pizza, Bea.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.508
And he's very good-looking.

51:22.557 --> 51:24.864
-You believe in Jesus, Ethan?
-Oh, yeah.

51:24.907 --> 51:27.345
This is why I didn't
want you to come over.

51:27.388 --> 51:30.826
What? What's the matter
with talking about Jesus?

51:30.870 --> 51:33.264
-Ethan's Jewish, dad.
-It's-it's cool.

51:33.307 --> 51:37.268
I mean,
Jews can talk about Jesus.

51:37.311 --> 51:39.357
You know, he was a Jew. So...

51:44.623 --> 51:45.841
Jesus was a Jew?

51:48.757 --> 51:50.063
Oh.

51:54.807 --> 51:56.983
Well, I-I guess
it's good thing, you know?

51:58.158 --> 51:59.812
Grandma Peg ain't going to hell.

52:04.077 --> 52:05.470
Or me.

52:05.513 --> 52:07.254
Would be a shame
if you did, son.

52:08.429 --> 52:10.953
Hmm.

52:10.997 --> 52:11.954
Thank you.

52:16.002 --> 52:17.090
You're good.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.744
There was a little piece.

52:18.787 --> 52:19.745
Thanks.

52:21.616 --> 52:24.315
I guess they're done.
I guess they're done.

52:24.358 --> 52:25.316
-I'll help you clean up.
-Okay.

52:27.970 --> 52:28.928
Yeah!

52:31.191 --> 52:34.586
-Sorry about all that.
-Don't be.

52:36.457 --> 52:40.983
I-I think it's kinda cool
that your dad is so into Jesus.

52:41.027 --> 52:42.333
-You better?
-Yeah.

52:42.376 --> 52:43.943
Your dad is my inspiration.

52:46.685 --> 52:49.296
When I was sick...

52:49.340 --> 52:50.602
it might have been nice to have

52:50.645 --> 52:53.431
something like that
to believe in.

52:53.474 --> 52:55.476
Maybe it would have
been less scary.

At least not
when they're together.

53:08.228 --> 53:10.187
Oh, they always laugh.

53:10.230 --> 53:12.928

It's a little...

53:25.854 --> 53:28.988
It's a little stereotypical
teen for me.

53:29.031 --> 53:31.904
Generally-generally speaking.

53:31.947 --> 53:35.821
Well, this basic bitch
can't wait to go.

53:35.864 --> 53:41.870
-But, only if it's with you.
-Okay.

53:41.914 --> 53:45.787

Going to prom.

53:45.831 --> 53:47.311
Hey, Ethan, come on.
Get over here, man.

53:47.354 --> 53:50.270

54:31.355 --> 54:32.312
You work here?

54:35.272 --> 54:37.491
No, Esther,
I'm picking up your trash

54:37.535 --> 54:39.319
because I don't work here.

54:39.363 --> 54:40.625
I really think you should

54:40.668 --> 54:43.192
reconsider the free trip
to Disney.

54:43.236 --> 54:45.543
I wasn't really embarrassed
about anything anymore.

54:45.586 --> 54:46.544
You're right.

54:47.936 --> 54:49.982
Because I'm poor.

54:50.025 --> 54:54.769
So poor that sometimes I help
pay rent for the tiny house

54:54.813 --> 54:57.990
I live in
with my disabled parents.

54:58.033 --> 54:59.818
But you knew that
because you told everyone

54:59.861 --> 55:01.950
in fifth grade
that they were retarded.

55:03.691 --> 55:05.476
You may have more money
than me,

55:05.519 --> 55:06.868
but I have an IQ of one-forty,

55:06.912 --> 55:09.567
and the boyfriend
you wish you had.

55:09.610 --> 55:12.613
And I know that because Gina
said that you told everyone

55:12.657 --> 55:13.788
you'd let him finger you
in front of

55:13.832 --> 55:16.356
the whole football team
if he asked.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.184
She also let it slip
that you and Andy

55:18.227 --> 55:19.577
haven't had sex since
the party.

55:20.708 --> 55:22.057
So...

55:22.101 --> 55:23.276
-Hi.
-How you doin'?

55:27.628 --> 55:32.677
-Mmm. shall we?
-Sure.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.722
-Bye, ladies.
-Bye, Esther.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.075
-That's obviously not true.
-Really?

55:41.990 --> 55:43.644
Life was good.

55:43.688 --> 55:45.298
I made enough money
to go to Disney

55:45.342 --> 55:46.691
and buy a dress for prom.

55:48.388 --> 55:50.303
I was kicking ass at school.

55:51.522 --> 55:53.088
Track had never been better.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.789
And Ethan and I
were getting close.

55:57.832 --> 55:59.225
Wait, wait.

56:01.053 --> 56:03.142
I'm not losing my virginity
in the back of a car

56:03.185 --> 56:05.753
like every other woman
in my family.

56:05.797 --> 56:08.147
-Got it?
-Got it.

56:08.190 --> 56:09.540
Really close.

56:09.583 --> 56:10.541
Screw it.

56:20.377 --> 56:21.943
Good morning, Bea.

56:21.987 --> 56:24.076
I wanted to chat with you
about something.

56:24.119 --> 56:27.122
I swear that was not me
in the parking lot last night.

56:27.166 --> 56:30.169
I've-I've never even
been in a Land Rover before.

56:30.212 --> 56:33.259
What are you talking about?
You know what?

56:33.302 --> 56:35.261
-I don't wanna know.
-Good.

56:35.304 --> 56:38.264
I wanted to talk about your
feelings toward college.

56:38.307 --> 56:41.006
Who said I had any
feelings about it?

56:41.049 --> 56:45.053
Actions speak louder than words,
Bea. What are you doing?

56:45.097 --> 56:47.839
Looking for the motivational
poster you're reading from.

56:47.882 --> 56:50.276
Bea, I'm serious.
You have really good grades,

56:50.319 --> 56:53.322
good SAT scores, and I have to
hound you just to get you

56:53.366 --> 56:55.629
to finish your application.

56:55.673 --> 56:57.718
And now I see,
you've only applied

56:57.762 --> 57:01.200
to local community colleges.

57:01.243 --> 57:02.375
Why limit yourself?

57:05.944 --> 57:09.469
Look, I know things at home
look a bit different

57:09.513 --> 57:10.775
for you than most kids here.

57:10.818 --> 57:12.472
Well, then you should know then

57:12.516 --> 57:14.822
why my parents can't
afford most schools.

57:14.866 --> 57:18.391
I-I don't mean to overstep, but
perhaps whoever's helping you

57:18.435 --> 57:21.916
with tuition now, maybe
could help you with college?

57:21.960 --> 57:23.483
Ugh. The last thing I need is

57:23.527 --> 57:25.311
more charity from my
aunt and uncle.

57:25.354 --> 57:27.269
I mean, they already keep
a photo of me on their mantle

57:27.313 --> 57:30.490
next to the starving kid
in Africa they sponsor.

57:30.534 --> 57:31.491
Really?

57:33.014 --> 57:36.365
Um, maybe financial aid
is another option.

57:36.409 --> 57:38.890
Y-you know, with your grades
and extra-curriculars,

57:38.933 --> 57:40.979
you have a shot at getting
a really good package.

57:41.022 --> 57:43.503
Yeah, it's not just
about the money.

57:43.547 --> 57:47.376
Look, I gotta, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late.

57:47.420 --> 57:50.336
Ah, wait-wait-wait. Okay, okay.
Wait, just sit, alright?

57:52.251 --> 57:54.471
Alright, why don't we
just take a step back

57:54.514 --> 57:56.647
from reality for a second?

57:56.690 --> 57:58.126
If you could go to a school,

57:58.170 --> 57:59.911
anywhere in the world,
where would you go?

58:02.522 --> 58:04.350
Honestly, I don't know.

58:04.393 --> 58:06.831
I've never really seriously
thought about it.

58:06.874 --> 58:09.268
Okay. Um, what's your
favorite subject?

58:09.311 --> 58:13.054
Mm, I... Science.
I like astronomy a lot.

58:13.098 --> 58:16.710
That's a great start. I have...

58:16.754 --> 58:19.278
Where is it?

58:19.321 --> 58:22.803
Here are some great schools
with excellent science programs.

58:24.588 --> 58:25.937
Tips and tricks.

58:25.980 --> 58:27.329
I'd be more than happy to write

58:27.373 --> 58:28.592
a letter of recommendation
for you.

58:30.289 --> 58:34.032
Hmm. These are all really
good schools.

58:34.075 --> 58:36.121
You think
I could actually get in?

58:36.164 --> 58:38.123
Shoot for the stars,
you'll hit the roof.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.474
That's kind of a messed
up saying.

58:41.518 --> 58:43.781
Bea, a little more
energy and effort

58:43.824 --> 58:45.565
and I think you could
get into any place.

58:47.132 --> 58:49.482
You're an exceptional student.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.790
Thanks, Mr. V.
I'll think about it.

58:52.833 --> 58:56.097
Alright. Hey, exciting stuff.

58:56.141 --> 58:58.099
Yeah, well, well. Whatever.

58:59.710 --> 59:00.667
I guess.

59:13.027 --> 59:15.160

what you're gonna do

59:15.203 --> 59:17.031

to worry about right now

59:21.993 --> 59:24.778
to worry about the future.

59:24.822 --> 59:25.779
Why?

59:27.085 --> 59:29.696
I was just thinking...

59:29.740 --> 59:35.572
I don't really have like
a...goal in life.

59:35.615 --> 59:39.053

Well, I... You know, I think
you can do anything you want.

1:02:34.838 --> 1:02:37.275
Guys, here she comes.

1:02:37.318 --> 1:02:40.321
Hi. Uh, is there any way
you could buy us a six pack?

1:02:41.453 --> 1:02:42.410
You can keep the change.

1:02:57.817 --> 1:03:00.864
I'm sorry. Are you bored?

1:03:00.907 --> 1:03:03.301
I didn't say anything.

1:03:03.344 --> 1:03:04.302
Why are you mad?

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:08.872
I'm not mad, but it's like,
I haven't seen you in like

1:03:08.915 --> 1:03:10.264
a month and you said that you
didn't want to go to

1:03:10.308 --> 1:03:11.744
prom, and now you are,
and I didn't get a date

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:12.789
'cause you said that
we weren't gonna go

1:03:12.832 --> 1:03:14.268
and now I'm just like...stuck.

1:03:16.488 --> 1:03:19.534
Uh, I'm sorry.

1:03:19.578 --> 1:03:22.450
I wasn't planning on it,
it just...

1:03:22.494 --> 1:03:25.192
It just happened. What...

1:03:25.236 --> 1:03:26.280
what do you want me to do?

1:03:27.716 --> 1:03:30.676
-Don't go.
-Are you serious?

1:03:30.719 --> 1:03:32.591
Haven't you heard
of hos before bros?

1:03:32.634 --> 1:03:34.811
No. Because that's not a thing.

1:03:34.854 --> 1:03:38.075
-You're being ridiculous.
-Fine, then. I'll leave.

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:40.817
-Wait, you can't leave.
-Don't tell me what to do.

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:42.122
You're always telling
me what to do!

1:03:42.166 --> 1:03:43.950
What is that supposed to mean?

1:03:43.994 --> 1:03:45.473
Why don't you figure it out
while you walk home?

1:03:45.517 --> 1:03:47.475
-Fine, I will!
-Fine.

1:03:47.519 --> 1:03:50.304
And you know what?
For the record,

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:52.959
I don't think I'm the reason
you don't have a date to prom.

1:03:55.875 --> 1:03:57.529
Wait!

1:03:57.572 --> 1:03:59.444
I didn't mean it.

1:03:59.487 --> 1:04:00.445
Come back!

1:04:03.187 --> 1:04:05.232
Okay... What are you looking at?

1:04:09.062 --> 1:04:10.020
Oh.

1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:16.809
I didn't think I could feel
any worse in that moment.

1:04:18.942 --> 1:04:20.726
But everything happens
for a reason.

1:04:22.293 --> 1:04:23.642
Godzilla?

1:04:23.685 --> 1:04:26.166
Godzilla! My baby!

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:28.125
Hi. Hi.

1:04:30.562 --> 1:04:32.869
What're you,
what're doing here?

1:04:33.782 --> 1:04:34.740
Hey!

1:04:36.046 --> 1:04:38.265
Honey, I missed you.

1:04:38.309 --> 1:04:40.006
But at least
I could make this right.

1:04:40.050 --> 1:04:41.225
You're coming with me.

1:04:43.923 --> 1:04:47.492
My baby! Ah!
You're coming with me.

1:04:50.756 --> 1:04:52.105
You did the right thing.
I think we're...

1:04:52.149 --> 1:04:54.325
I think we're good now.
Go back to work.

1:04:57.850 --> 1:04:59.765
Where is my wife?
Where is my Sharon?

1:04:59.808 --> 1:05:01.898
I need you to calm down, sir.
Look, she was selling

1:05:01.941 --> 1:05:03.595
alcohol to minors,
and it wasn't the first time.

1:05:03.638 --> 1:05:04.944
-No, you can't arrest her!
-She was selling alcohol.

1:05:04.988 --> 1:05:06.467
She admitted to it.
We're gonna take her in.

1:05:06.511 --> 1:05:07.904
Look, you don't understand.
Look, you-you...

1:05:07.947 --> 1:05:09.253
Unless you wanna get
back there with her.

1:05:09.296 --> 1:05:11.081
Hey, put you're hand
behind your back!

1:05:11.124 --> 1:05:12.952
Look, she's not gonna
be good back there.

1:05:12.996 --> 1:05:14.693
-You gotta... Okay. Okay!
-Calm down. Hey.

1:05:14.736 --> 1:05:16.347
Look, she can't be there
alone, alright.

1:05:16.390 --> 1:05:17.739
-She won't be. You're goin'...
-I gotta go with her.

1:05:17.783 --> 1:05:19.132
Calm down.

1:05:19.176 --> 1:05:22.527
Okay, we're home.

1:05:26.661 --> 1:05:28.576
I'm sorry they didn't
take care of you.

1:05:30.578 --> 1:05:33.277
Ugh. You smell like hot trash.

1:05:34.713 --> 1:05:36.280
Hey, you guys.

1:05:36.323 --> 1:05:38.195
Look who I found.

1:05:39.674 --> 1:05:40.632
Hello?

1:05:42.416 --> 1:05:44.027
Oh. Okay.

1:05:49.815 --> 1:05:50.772
What?!

1:05:52.470 --> 1:05:53.427
What?!

1:05:55.255 --> 1:05:56.648
How much is bail?

1:06:16.537 --> 1:06:19.323
You know, I mean,
jail ain't that bad.

1:06:19.366 --> 1:06:23.849
The food was decent, right?
An-and-and you don't gotta work.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:27.896
Mom, can you turn the TV off?

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:31.161
I don't normally do this.
I really like you...

1:06:31.204 --> 1:06:33.728
We all need to have
a serious talk.

1:06:33.772 --> 1:06:38.124
You found him!
Oh, my good boy!

1:06:38.168 --> 1:06:40.344
He's back!
What a good boy!

1:06:42.868 --> 1:06:44.739
You are the best little boy.

1:06:44.783 --> 1:06:47.133
-Don't you dare run away again.
-Yeah.

1:06:47.177 --> 1:06:48.526
He didn't, mom.

1:06:51.094 --> 1:06:52.008
I gave him away.

1:06:53.705 --> 1:06:54.880
Well, why would you do that?

1:06:56.534 --> 1:06:57.491
I, uh...

1:06:59.580 --> 1:07:01.800
I wanted him to have
a real family.

1:07:05.543 --> 1:07:08.154
I mean, we are a real family.

1:07:11.288 --> 1:07:13.072
Right.

1:07:13.116 --> 1:07:14.552
Right.

1:07:14.595 --> 1:07:17.903
-And you're real parents?
-Yeah, we are.

1:07:19.948 --> 1:07:22.951
Well, real dads don't miss
their kid's track meets

1:07:22.995 --> 1:07:25.693
to race toy cars.

1:07:25.737 --> 1:07:28.957
And real moms don't steal
their kid's money

1:07:29.001 --> 1:07:30.307
and blow it on slots.

1:07:30.350 --> 1:07:32.744
And real parents
don't need their kids

1:07:32.787 --> 1:07:35.399
to bail them out of jail!

1:07:35.442 --> 1:07:38.271
You owe me five $500.

1:07:38.315 --> 1:07:40.056
That money was for me!

1:07:41.796 --> 1:07:44.103
I-I don't have five hundred
bucks, Bea.

1:07:44.147 --> 1:07:45.800
Well, then,
when do you get paid?

1:07:50.066 --> 1:07:51.023
Dad?

1:07:53.330 --> 1:07:56.550
The race track's been
kinda slow lately, you know.

1:07:57.856 --> 1:07:58.813
Wai-wait.

1:07:59.901 --> 1:08:02.034
Did... did they let you go?

1:08:04.689 --> 1:08:05.646
When?

1:08:08.693 --> 1:08:09.911
I don't know.
Like, a few months ago.

1:08:09.955 --> 1:08:11.435
Why didn't you tell me?

1:08:11.478 --> 1:08:13.132
Because I got a new job already.

1:08:13.176 --> 1:08:16.092
-Wh-where?
-At Lyft.

1:08:16.135 --> 1:08:18.572
I mean,
as soon as I fix my truck.

1:08:18.616 --> 1:08:20.618
Okay, okay...

1:08:20.661 --> 1:08:23.838
Between mom's paycheck,
and disability

1:08:23.882 --> 1:08:26.972
we should, we should fine
until you get a real job.

1:08:28.321 --> 1:08:30.149
Your mama ain't getting
disability.

1:08:30.193 --> 1:08:32.282
What? Why?

1:08:32.325 --> 1:08:33.674
Because I cancelled it.

1:08:33.718 --> 1:08:36.242
Oh! Do you know
how long it took me

1:08:36.286 --> 1:08:37.939
to get mom signed up for that?

1:08:37.983 --> 1:08:39.419
Why would you do that?

1:08:39.463 --> 1:08:41.378
Because your mother
is not disabled.

1:08:41.421 --> 1:08:44.859
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry,
I forgot. She's special!

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:48.776
Yes, she is.
We all are.

1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:52.171
My God!
Dad, that isn't a compliment!

1:08:52.215 --> 1:08:55.000
Do you not know
what that word means?

1:08:55.043 --> 1:08:57.959
Special is just the word
people use in this family

1:08:58.003 --> 1:09:02.050
because they can't admit that
you and mom are both retarded!

1:09:02.094 --> 1:09:04.357
-Ahh!
-Oh!

1:09:04.401 --> 1:09:06.403
Grandma Loretta was right.

1:09:06.446 --> 1:09:09.232
They never should've
let you have kids.

1:09:09.275 --> 1:09:11.843
We'd all be better off
if I wasn't alive.

1:09:23.246 --> 1:09:24.725
I'm not proud of what I said.

1:09:25.944 --> 1:09:26.901
But isn't it true?

1:09:27.989 --> 1:09:29.339
Do I even wanna wake up?

1:09:32.211 --> 1:09:35.780
What is that?
Is that "the" light?

1:09:35.823 --> 1:09:38.217
Am I dead? Because I was just
posing a question.

1:09:38.261 --> 1:09:41.220
I-I do. I-I want to wake up.

1:09:41.264 --> 1:09:44.876
Wait, where'd it go?
Am I going to hell?

1:09:47.095 --> 1:09:49.707
Jesus! That's bright.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:51.883
Well, her pupils are reacting.

1:09:51.926 --> 1:09:53.972
Ah! Thank you. I'm alive.

1:09:54.015 --> 1:09:55.365
I-is that a good thing?

1:09:56.844 --> 1:09:58.237
Would you all mind
taking a step back?

1:09:58.281 --> 1:10:00.761
-Yeah, give the man some space.
-Sorry.

1:10:02.676 --> 1:10:05.505
As I was saying, her pupils are
constricting, which is good.

1:10:05.549 --> 1:10:07.159
But I'd liked to see
quicker reactivity.

1:10:07.203 --> 1:10:08.508
Sorry, what does that mean?

1:10:08.552 --> 1:10:10.380
It's common in
traumatic brain injuries.

1:10:10.423 --> 1:10:12.817
She has a traumatic
brain injury?

1:10:12.860 --> 1:10:14.732
Oh, God! She's gonna end up
just like her father.

1:10:14.775 --> 1:10:16.864
-Hey!
-Ma... Ma, it's okay.

1:10:16.908 --> 1:10:18.518
Oh, God! I'm gonna
end up like my father.

1:10:18.562 --> 1:10:20.346
Will she?

1:10:20.390 --> 1:10:21.826
I don't know your medical
history, but if she does have

1:10:21.869 --> 1:10:23.567
a TBI, they range in severity.

1:10:23.610 --> 1:10:24.959
Some people make
a full recovery.

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:26.831
And some don't?

1:10:26.874 --> 1:10:27.919
It depends on the severity.

1:10:29.964 --> 1:10:32.663
-I'll check back soon.
-Thank you, doctor.

1:10:32.706 --> 1:10:34.621
My whole life, I've been
torn between wanting

1:10:34.665 --> 1:10:38.625
to get away from my parents
and wanting to care for them.

1:10:38.669 --> 1:10:40.192
Now, I can't do either.

1:10:40.236 --> 1:10:41.585
In our follow-up meeting
you said

1:10:41.628 --> 1:10:43.543
you wanted to apply to UCLA.

1:10:43.587 --> 1:10:46.416
But you never finished
your application.

1:10:46.459 --> 1:10:48.287
-Why?
-Because I'm not going.

1:10:54.598 --> 1:10:55.990
What does the poster
behind you say?

1:10:57.905 --> 1:10:59.690
"Hang in there, dood!"

1:10:59.733 --> 1:11:01.866
No, dood.
The one that says,

1:11:01.909 --> 1:11:04.738
"Don't be afraid to fail.
Be afraid not to try."

1:11:06.087 --> 1:11:07.872
I'm not afraid.

1:11:07.915 --> 1:11:08.960
And I have tried.

1:11:10.178 --> 1:11:12.180
But I can't...

1:11:12.224 --> 1:11:15.967
-You can.
-No, I mean, I can't leave.

1:11:17.490 --> 1:11:20.406
Ah... Nevada?
I-I don't understand, why?

1:11:20.450 --> 1:11:25.585
No, my parents, they... they
will literally die without me.

1:11:25.629 --> 1:11:27.631
Look... I...

1:11:27.674 --> 1:11:29.328
I know your parents
are going through

1:11:29.372 --> 1:11:30.808
some challenges,
but from what I understand--

1:11:30.851 --> 1:11:34.072
Okay, you-you don't
understand anything.

1:11:46.127 --> 1:11:48.086
Hey. Hey, you okay?

1:11:48.129 --> 1:11:50.001
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

1:11:50.044 --> 1:11:51.045
'Cause you're crying.

1:11:52.395 --> 1:11:53.613
Wanna ditch?

1:11:53.657 --> 1:11:55.528
-My parents aren't home.
-Okay.

1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:04.494
Holy shit.

1:12:04.537 --> 1:12:06.322
Oh, my God,
I can't breathe.

1:12:09.368 --> 1:12:11.283
-Gonna miss you, weirdo.
-Hmm.

1:12:14.417 --> 1:12:18.943
Hey... I'm still gonna come
visit you every weekend.

1:12:18.986 --> 1:12:20.684
Well, you won't have to.

1:12:23.251 --> 1:12:24.427
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

1:12:24.470 --> 1:12:27.604
-Was this break up sex?
-No. No.

1:12:29.997 --> 1:12:33.174
You won't have to visit
because

1:12:33.218 --> 1:12:34.480
I'm not going.

1:12:38.005 --> 1:12:39.572
You-you didn't get in?

1:12:42.619 --> 1:12:43.576
I didn't apply.

1:12:47.014 --> 1:12:49.103
I... I don't understand.

1:12:50.888 --> 1:12:51.845
Yeah, you wouldn't.

1:12:55.066 --> 1:12:56.023
I could try.

1:12:57.590 --> 1:12:59.679
I mean...

1:12:59.723 --> 1:13:03.596
I know you don't like talking
about feelings and shit, but...

1:13:05.032 --> 1:13:06.512
I wanna understand.

1:13:08.775 --> 1:13:13.867
While I was off being happy,
everything here went to shit.

1:13:13.911 --> 1:13:17.436
My parents are helpless
without me.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.221
Really? Did you change
your own diapers?

1:13:22.136 --> 1:13:23.834
No.

1:13:23.877 --> 1:13:27.185
Your parents took care of
baby Bea for a long time

1:13:27.228 --> 1:13:29.883
without any help from you.

1:13:32.233 --> 1:13:36.150
So, maybe, because...

1:13:36.194 --> 1:13:38.283
you do everything for them

1:13:38.326 --> 1:13:41.112
you've convinced yourself
that they're helpless.

1:13:43.027 --> 1:13:44.637
So...

1:13:44.681 --> 1:13:46.857
maybe, going to school

1:13:46.900 --> 1:13:48.641
is actually what's best
for everyone.

1:13:51.078 --> 1:13:52.036
I can't.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:55.648
I have to take care of them.

1:13:59.913 --> 1:14:01.654
And I could take care of you,
too...

1:14:02.568 --> 1:14:03.917
if you ever need me to.

1:14:07.617 --> 1:14:09.706

-I don't know.

sick again.

No, no, I don't...
I don't think that you will.

1:14:29.073 --> 1:14:31.510
I'm just saying that
if you did, I would...

1:14:31.554 --> 1:14:32.511
you know, be here.

1:14:39.562 --> 1:14:42.260

fantasy is that, Bea?

1:14:45.350 --> 1:14:48.832

you want my cancer to come back.

1:14:48.875 --> 1:14:52.531

I didn't say that.

every morning scared.

1:14:56.579 --> 1:15:00.539
So scared that sometimes
I can't even get out of bed.

1:15:00.583 --> 1:15:04.500
Because my first thought is,
what if I get sick again?

1:15:04.543 --> 1:15:09.374
So, you're here
just secretly hoping I do...

1:15:09.417 --> 1:15:12.159
Because what?

1:15:12.203 --> 1:15:14.422

reason to feel bad for you?

1:15:14.466 --> 1:15:16.816

1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:18.818

with problems.

with problems.

pitying me?

I think you like

1:15:29.916 --> 1:15:31.918
that you're smarter
than your parents.

1:15:31.962 --> 1:15:33.659
That way you get to be
in charge.

1:15:33.703 --> 1:15:35.139
And, I think you're scared

1:15:35.182 --> 1:15:36.532
to go to school because then you

1:15:36.575 --> 1:15:37.837
won't have anyone
to push around.

1:15:37.881 --> 1:15:39.447

parents as an excuse

going to use me as one.

1:15:43.843 --> 1:15:45.932
Wha... Where are you going?

1:15:45.976 --> 1:15:48.326
I fought really hard
to have a future.

1:15:48.369 --> 1:15:51.242
So, it's really messed up

1:15:51.285 --> 1:15:53.549

throwing theirs away.

1:15:53.592 --> 1:15:56.377

can't be part of that.

You weren't answering my calls.

1:17:25.292 --> 1:17:27.294

what to do, but...

as a joke?

Oh, well, baby girl!

Oh, God!

1:25:11.889 --> 1:25:14.587
-Oh, Bea! Oh, God!
-Bea!

1:25:14.631 --> 1:25:16.154
Bea, we're all here, honey.
We're all here.

1:25:16.198 --> 1:25:17.721
-We're so worried about you.
-Not me.

1:25:17.764 --> 1:25:19.505
I knew she'd pull through.

1:25:19.549 --> 1:25:23.161
Our family's harder
to kill than cockroaches.

1:25:23.205 --> 1:25:26.425
Honey... I'm so sorry
we haven't been in a way

1:25:26.469 --> 1:25:29.341
that we should've been,
but we're here now, okay?

1:25:29.385 --> 1:25:31.256
And, sweetie, we're gonna get
you the best physical therapist

1:25:31.300 --> 1:25:33.563
or-or, acupuncturist,
whatever you need.

1:25:33.606 --> 1:25:34.912
-Okay?
-Go get the nurse.

1:25:34.955 --> 1:25:36.043
-Go get someone.
-Oh, uh, Dr. Patel.

1:25:36.087 --> 1:25:37.349
Yes, Dr. Patel.

1:25:40.961 --> 1:25:42.224
I love you, Bambi.

1:25:43.399 --> 1:25:45.052
I love you, mom!

1:25:45.096 --> 1:25:47.664
I'm sorry if I scared you.

1:25:47.707 --> 1:25:49.056
I'm sorry, if I scared you.

1:25:50.623 --> 1:25:52.799
I was a little scared.

1:25:52.843 --> 1:25:54.758
So I just pretended
you were sleeping.

1:25:56.151 --> 1:25:57.456
That way I knew you'd wake up.

1:25:59.023 --> 1:26:00.894
But I didn't know when.

1:26:00.938 --> 1:26:03.854
So I went and get this
balloon for you

1:26:03.897 --> 1:26:06.465
as fast as I could so you
could have it when you woke up.

1:26:06.509 --> 1:26:08.511
But it had a hole,
and, now it's flat.

1:26:11.383 --> 1:26:13.255
That's perfect.

1:26:13.298 --> 1:26:15.431
Thank you, mom.

1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:20.131
-Hi, dad.
-Hi, Bambi!

1:26:23.265 --> 1:26:25.702
-There you are.
-Hi, mom.

1:26:25.745 --> 1:26:27.225
What you doin'?

1:26:27.269 --> 1:26:29.401
I'm editing Xander's
English final.

1:26:30.663 --> 1:26:32.665
Not that it's gonna help.

1:26:32.709 --> 1:26:34.450
Geek! Where's Ben?

1:26:36.408 --> 1:26:37.366
Uh...

1:26:39.803 --> 1:26:42.980
He had a pretty good
anxiety attack this morning.

1:26:43.023 --> 1:26:44.895
I think, just the stress
of everything.

1:26:44.938 --> 1:26:48.290
I gave him some of my Xanax,
and he passed out in the car.

1:26:50.292 --> 1:26:51.249
I... I...

1:26:53.382 --> 1:26:55.819
I always felt bad that
I was the one

1:26:55.862 --> 1:26:58.648
born without the disability.

1:26:58.691 --> 1:27:01.781
Sharon's life hasn't
been very easy now.

1:27:01.825 --> 1:27:04.262
But that hasn't stopped her
from enjoying it

1:27:04.306 --> 1:27:05.568
more than anyone I know.

1:27:06.308 --> 1:27:07.352
Hmm.

1:27:09.093 --> 1:27:10.529
-Yeah.
-And, Bea...

1:27:13.271 --> 1:27:15.360
Thank goodness.

1:27:25.805 --> 1:27:27.720
That's a lot of flowers.

1:27:29.722 --> 1:27:31.246
You can come in.

1:27:32.638 --> 1:27:34.727
I wasn't sure
if you'd want me to.

1:27:43.475 --> 1:27:44.868
Where's your rest
of the family?

1:27:44.911 --> 1:27:46.696
I sent them home.

1:27:46.739 --> 1:27:49.481
Grandma Peg hadn't showered
in, like, three days.

1:27:49.525 --> 1:27:51.222
Oh!

1:27:51.266 --> 1:27:52.789
It's not a record
or anything?

1:27:57.620 --> 1:27:59.274
Sit.

1:28:08.544 --> 1:28:11.547
I feel like...
this is all my fault.

1:28:13.244 --> 1:28:16.421
Well, you're gonna have to
take that up with Nia.

1:28:16.465 --> 1:28:20.338
Because she feels
like it's all her fault.

1:28:20.382 --> 1:28:23.950
And Uncle Ben
and Aunt Joy blame themselves.

1:28:23.994 --> 1:28:25.909
And Grandma Peg
and Grandma Loretta

1:28:25.952 --> 1:28:27.389
blame each other.

1:28:27.432 --> 1:28:29.347
So...

1:28:29.391 --> 1:28:30.696
Okay.

1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:33.569
Guess I'm off the hook.

1:28:33.612 --> 1:28:34.961
Yeah.

1:28:35.005 --> 1:28:37.007
How are you feeling?

1:28:37.050 --> 1:28:39.139
Okay.

1:28:39.183 --> 1:28:41.751
The doctor said that
there's no serious brain injury

1:28:41.794 --> 1:28:44.667
and I should make
a full recovery.

1:28:44.710 --> 1:28:46.582
I'm so glad you're okay.

1:28:49.411 --> 1:28:51.848
I put a lot of my shit on you.

1:28:51.891 --> 1:28:53.502
And that's not okay.

1:28:55.330 --> 1:28:57.723
Well, you weren't wrong.

1:28:57.767 --> 1:29:00.813
Yeah, but I got
pissed at you for...

1:29:00.857 --> 1:29:02.119
giving up on your dream

1:29:02.162 --> 1:29:04.991
when I still don't know
what I wanna do.

1:29:07.254 --> 1:29:09.605
But...

1:29:09.648 --> 1:29:11.607
I do know...

1:29:11.650 --> 1:29:12.999
I don't wanna break up.

1:29:15.001 --> 1:29:16.438
Me either.

1:29:27.274 --> 1:29:30.060
Sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1:29:30.103 --> 1:29:32.976
I just, uh,
I finished my report.

1:29:33.019 --> 1:29:34.412
And I wanted to say goodbye

1:29:34.456 --> 1:29:36.762
and good luck with everything.

focus on you for a while.

Not sure if I'm more
nervous about not getting in

1:34:00.504 --> 1:34:02.419
or getting in
and actually having to go.

you just gotta remember--

Please don't say,
"Hang in there."

1:34:20.089 --> 1:34:21.786

-Yeah, you were.

I can see your purse.

1:34:46.463 --> 1:34:48.073

1:34:48.117 --> 1:34:49.248
Nothing.

1:34:49.292 --> 1:34:50.554
Wait, you're crying.

1:34:50.597 --> 1:34:52.208

you something, Peg.

1:35:11.401 --> 1:35:13.316
I know...

my Derek ain't the same
he was before his accident.

1:35:17.407 --> 1:35:21.150
I say he is,
but... he ain't.

1:35:22.629 --> 1:35:26.155
Oh, he was gonna be a doctor.
Hmm!

1:35:26.198 --> 1:35:29.027
I know plenty of kids say that,
but he really was.

1:35:29.071 --> 1:35:32.074
He was gonna buy me
a big house, too.

1:35:34.337 --> 1:35:36.382
I guess
I didn't wanna admit

1:35:36.426 --> 1:35:39.603
that was never gonna happen.

1:35:39.646 --> 1:35:40.996
Or that Sharon...

1:35:42.475 --> 1:35:44.477
...would be
the right girl for him.

1:35:47.263 --> 1:35:48.743
But she is.

1:35:51.571 --> 1:35:54.792
Well, that's...
sweet of you to say, Loretta.

1:35:54.836 --> 1:35:56.794
And while we're apologizing...

1:35:56.838 --> 1:35:58.143
I-I'm not apologizing.
