00:11.452 --> 00:14.520
Tonight: James wears a stripey jumper.

00:14.720 --> 00:21.552
Richard drives a stripey Lamborghini,
and we name the greatest car maker in the world!!

00:29.452 --> 00:32.417
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:32.418 --> 00:33.697
Wow!

00:33.698 --> 00:34.698
Amazing!

00:35.222 --> 00:36.222
Now.

00:36.924 --> 00:42.060
As we know, as we know,
you can never get rid of a baddie, OK?

00:42.360 --> 00:46.800
No matter how much you kill them.
Remember Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction?

00:47.500 --> 00:52.684
She was stabbed, she was drowned,
half an hour later, reared up out of the bath.

00:52.784 --> 00:57.024
Then you got the Daleks, Blofeld, Peter Mandelson!

00:57.224 --> 01:02.936
They just keep coming back.
Then there's Top Gear's perennial baddie.

01:06.136 --> 01:11.660
Yes, it's the caravan.
Now as regular viewers of Dave will know

01:11.960 --> 01:16.060
we have, over the last 24 hours,
done our very best to rid the world

01:16.560 --> 01:24.428
of the caravan menace.
I think there's one more actualy.

01:27.028 --> 01:33.028
That is, I think you'll agree, sterling work in our battle
to free the road of these mobile traffic jams.

01:33.328 --> 01:39.300
Sadly, it's a battle we're losing.
There are now almost half a million caravans

01:39.500 --> 01:44.764
on UK roads, and the British are the most
prolific caravanning nation in Europe.

01:44.964 --> 01:49.020
A title we've held for almost four years,
according to the Caravan Council.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.964
In short, they're building them
faster than we can destroy them.

01:53.464 --> 01:57.904
So we need a scientific approach to getting them
off the roads, and I may have found that!!

03:04.732 --> 03:06.096
It worked!!

03:19.096 --> 03:24.452
What you're witnessing here, viewers, is the maiden
voyage of the world's first caravan air ship.

03:25.052 --> 03:28.204
I believe this is the solution to all our problems.

03:28.304 --> 03:33.076
There are only two ways to go caravanning:
you can have your two litre diesel

03:33.176 --> 03:36.940
Toe your caravan, obscure the view
of all the people you're annoying

03:37.040 --> 03:42.220
or you can bring it up. Here.
Everybody wins. Driving is more fun

03:42.320 --> 03:44.313
and caravanning is more exciting.

03:44.897 --> 03:45.897
However...

03:46.035 --> 03:51.156
As with all all cutting edge engineering
projects, there are teething problems.

03:51.256 --> 03:55.424
Normally, you drive along with your caravan
and your car and when you get to a caravan site,

03:55.524 --> 03:58.268
you have a car to use.
I don't of course, so I need

03:58.368 --> 04:03.556
somebody to take the car
to the caravan site for me.

04:03.756 --> 04:08.088
And for that, I'm calling on my old
caravan-destroying mate, Mr. Richard Hammond.

04:09.288 --> 04:11.924
Yes, and because it doesn't
have to log the caravan around

04:12.024 --> 04:18.628
it can be a nice car.

04:18.728 --> 04:21.296
This car will never, ever
hitch itself to a swift Rapide.

04:21.696 --> 04:26.860
It's a Lamborghini, probably the least
caravanish car company ever, and this

04:27.060 --> 04:36.036
is their new Gallardo Balboni, it's a tribute to
Valentino Balboni. Lamborghini most famous test driver

04:37.636 --> 04:43.700
Although he wore a cardigan to work, he was
a mentalist. And as a tribute to his mentalness,

04:43.900 --> 04:50.160
this particularly Gallardo is the most mental Lambo
there's been for a while. But more of that later.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.044
Because first, I shall ring James and offer
him some encouragement.

04:56.744 --> 05:01.092
Hammond? May.
That thing is going to crash, and burn

05:01.792 --> 05:05.860
and explode and you'll be scattered in a
million pieces across the English countryside.

05:06.260 --> 05:09.060
Don't be so defeatist. Anyway,
I've got an address for you.

05:09.744 --> 05:14.924
It's Hunter's Moon Caravan Club, which is
just outside wear ham in Dorset.

05:15.024 --> 05:18.576
I've made the booking. They are expecting an air ship,
and i'll take for lunch by the river.

05:18.976 --> 05:23.444
Right. See you in a bit.
Caravanning in a Lamborghini.

05:24.244 --> 05:26.436
I think he might actually
be on to something here.

05:33.036 --> 05:35.400
Let me tell you a bit about the caravan air ship

05:35.636 --> 05:40.500
It's 125 feet long, 110,000 cubic
feet of hot air holding it up

05:40.700 --> 05:45.476
and it's a very very ingenious solution, because
all the caravan attachments are still here.

05:45.576 --> 05:49.944
Instruments flip up out the table,
the gas burners go where the cooker would be,

05:50.044 --> 05:54.816
and can be used for cooking, the beds fit
where I'm sitting here. It is still a caravan,

05:54.916 --> 06:03.048
it's just a flying caravan.
It floats with the infinite blue. It's superb.

06:04.648 --> 06:08.620
Meanwhile, on the ground,
this was turning into the best drive

06:08.720 --> 06:10.633
to a caravan site ever.

06:10.634 --> 06:12.343
According to Top Gear research,

06:12.378 --> 06:17.068
37% of caravaners enjoy wife swapping.
Well Think what's gonna

06:17.168 --> 06:23.428
happen when the keys for this
baby come out the pot! Oh yeah!

06:23.528 --> 06:26.976
As I was saying, because this is a
tribute to their looniest test driver,

06:27.076 --> 06:31.068
Lambo ditched the usual four-wheel
drive for Gallardo and gone back to

06:31.468 --> 06:38.488
the hairy-chested rear wheel drive,
that makes it 120kg lighter

06:38.588 --> 06:43.208
all new steel brakes, instead of carbon ceramic
fancy ones. It's Lamborghini's punk album.

06:43.308 --> 06:46.858
Hammond, it's May!
- Oh Hello!! Your Alive!!

06:46.859 --> 06:49.291
How are you?
- I'm Very well. How's it going?

06:49.291 --> 06:53.397
Pretty good. Slight issue on the horizon, though.
- What?

06:53.446 --> 06:59.402
It's not the fastest aircraft in the world.
- How not quick is it?

06:59.403 --> 07:00.920
Well, top speed is about 17.

07:01.404 --> 07:08.412
70 miles an hour is not bad, in a straight line.
- No, 17 miles an hour.

07:08.512 --> 07:12.835
I think Dorset might be a bit far.
I've got a new address for you.

07:12.836 --> 07:17.231
Another address?
- Dale Acres caravan club site in Kent.

07:17.716 --> 07:20.922
Kent? Probably not my first choice of caravanning destination.

07:20.923 --> 07:22.539
I know, but it's not miles from here mate.

07:22.539 --> 07:25.081
I'll buy you an ice cream.
- I'll see you there.

07:27.057 --> 07:31.389
Right, campsite number two.
Here we come.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.461
It's now time for a spot of airborne lunch.

07:40.337 --> 07:44.981
This is unquestionably the most powerful cooker
ever fitted to a caravan.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.494
Very well cooked on one side.

07:55.085 --> 07:58.453
It's all part of the adventure of caravanning.

07:58.454 --> 07:59.454
Back to the Balboni.

08:02.298 --> 08:05.703
The thing is, the basicness makes it better to drive.

08:05.738 --> 08:08.376
The steering feels so much quicker

08:08.376 --> 08:10.894
because there's no four-wheel drive in the way

08:10.894 --> 08:16.400
and the gear change, the manual box feels
like it's shaking hands with an old friend.

08:20.053 --> 08:25.437
The only thing that isn't basic is price, because weirdly, this

08:25.537 --> 08:28.889
stripped out strictly functional costing Â£163,000, which is 18 grand

08:28.989 --> 08:33.951
dearer than the ordinary four-wheel drive one.

08:33.952 --> 08:36.820
So maybe less really is more.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.532
The Balboni propelled me towards our campsite in Kent.

08:43.727 --> 08:45.626
And then James rang again.

08:46.444 --> 08:47.444
Hello?

08:45.661 --> 08:49.035
Hello.
- Are you ringing from the grave?

08:49.036 --> 08:52.073
No, not at all. It's going marvellously up here, mate.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.871
You'd love it. There is one slight hitch, though.
- What is up now?

08:55.906 --> 08:58.045
The performance is slightly marginal.

08:58.145 --> 09:02.313
If I get ahead wind of more than 30 knots, I start to go backwards.

09:02.413 --> 09:06.487
You can't go into a wind of more than 30 knots?
- No.

09:06.488 --> 09:08.626
What is the wind speed now?

09:08.626 --> 09:12.883
It was 12.
- You're telling me you're being blown around Britain?

09:13.155 --> 09:15.240
It takes too long to get down to Kent

09:15.240 --> 09:18.159
so I will turn around and go the other way up to Suffolk.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.896
Right.

09:19.896 --> 09:21.638
Anyway, I've got an address for you.

09:21.639 --> 09:25.865
Why not book us into every caravan site in Britain before we left?

09:25.865 --> 09:30.409
Stop nit-picking, will you?

09:30.509 --> 09:35.893
What a norbert. If this air ship caravan
and scheme of his catches on,

09:35.993 --> 09:40.055
what we'll have is the skies full of air ships crashing into each other

09:40.055 --> 09:41.495
when the wind gets up

09:41.496 --> 09:45.753
And the roads full of cars crashing into each other
because they have to keep turn around.

09:54.389 --> 09:58.749
With the wind behind me, I headed for our new destination.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.469
Good morning, caravan club.
How can I help you?

10:01.469 --> 10:06.812
I was wondering if there were any pitches available
at the White House beach club this afternoon?

10:06.813 --> 10:09.488
What is your surname?
May. M A Y.

10:09.656 --> 10:13.130
Can I just ask if you have facilities for people arrive by air ship?

10:13.131 --> 10:18.746
By airship? Right okay, um..
You actually a member of this caravan club?

10:24.073 --> 10:31.984
Here I am in the village of - here, this village!
And it's somewhere I would never have seen.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.481
It's a really, really big tower over there.

10:36.516 --> 10:40.833
That's... well, that's clearly just a danger to caravaners.

10:40.933 --> 10:44.467
Look at it. Must remember to tell James about that.

10:44.467 --> 10:47.158
As As it turned out, at that moment,

10:47.159 --> 10:50.449
James had more than a tower to worry about.

10:51.679 --> 10:54.204
May Day, May Day, May Day.

10:54.205 --> 10:58.350
Norwich golf, papa golf, I'm about to enter your air space.

10:59.121 --> 11:04.552
Golf Tango to Papa Golf Nine, you're entering
an area of intense aerial activity.

11:04.552 --> 11:08.727
At the moment it is imperative that you remain clear -
well clear.

11:10.997 --> 11:16.136
Sorry, cannot comply, have no control
over air ship owing to wind conditions.

11:17.061 --> 11:19.296
Remain well clear.

11:19.764 --> 11:23.386
Norwich cannot comply.
- You have traffic left,

11:23.387 --> 11:26.920
11 o'clock, range of half a mile, fast moving. Similar left.

11:26.921 --> 11:29.042
Roger! Have visual.

11:29.971 --> 11:32.985
Further traffic in your right 3 o'clock.

11:39.620 --> 11:43.468
That's the news report and no news of a massive fireball burning over

11:43.468 --> 11:46.798
Northamptonshire or of people in the streets being hit by

11:46.798 --> 11:51.088
pieces of long burning hair and bad jumper.

11:51.089 --> 11:54.233
Anyway, I'm probably being pessimistic.

11:54.539 --> 11:59.566
I'm sure it is going very well.

12:00.761 --> 12:01.542
No!

12:01.542 --> 12:03.455
Stay where you are, man!

12:04.305 --> 12:06.515
I'm heading very close to the KLM City Hopper.

12:06.515 --> 12:10.075
Can you advise them to start abort take off?

12:10.076 --> 12:14.098
Papa Golf Nine, the police helicopter will surely be approach you.

12:15.013 --> 12:16.581
Police helicopter really not necessary.

12:16.582 --> 12:20.012
I will attempt to clear your zone at this altitude.

12:20.846 --> 12:22.026
Please don't call the police.

12:36.878 --> 12:39.139
He's not really aware of your intention,

12:39.139 --> 12:42.575
but you've strayed into the controlled air space of Norwich airport.

12:43.101 --> 12:46.568
I may be about to get a colossal aviation bollocking.

12:54.705 --> 12:57.921
Suffolk.. popular holiday destination.

12:58.911 --> 13:02.135
Just a few miles away now.

13:02.136 --> 13:04.760
James will have landed,

13:05.527 --> 13:06.527
set the van up,

13:04.795 --> 13:09.264
organised our little home from home,

13:09.265 --> 13:11.258
probably got the kettle on.

13:14.220 --> 13:17.479
With the rough of the sky cops still ringing in my ears.

13:17.479 --> 13:20.288
Finally, I reached a caravan site.

13:20.288 --> 13:24.330
I didn't know if it was the one I had booked into, but it would do.

13:24.855 --> 13:30.596
Here we go. The landing you won't even notice.
This is a lovely approach over the trees.

13:30.539 --> 13:34.540
This is a matter of a resting descent.
Little burst of gas.

13:35.038 --> 13:38.905
What I actually doing here is helping to realise the dreams

13:38.906 --> 13:41.379
that was held by many great man.

13:41.389 --> 13:46.019
People who envisaged the elegance of
the majesty of lighter-than-air flight.

13:46.020 --> 13:50.774
Zeppelin, Barnes Wallace, this is the man.

13:53.491 --> 13:54.491
A bit of drift.

13:55.640 --> 13:56.729
Drifting.

13:58.243 --> 13:59.690
This is difficult.

13:59.691 --> 14:01.747
Gas! Gas!

14:01.748 --> 14:03.487
It's going down.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.577
No!

14:10.969 --> 14:13.120
I may be going side way slightly!

14:15.860 --> 14:16.860
May Day!

14:18.774 --> 14:19.774
No!

14:21.253 --> 14:26.693
Bloody hell, stop! Stop! Stop!

14:36.924 --> 14:40.645
Papa Charlie echo, whiskey, echo, what?

14:40.646 --> 14:42.818
I think it has a lot of promise.

14:42.819 --> 14:46.026
James, airships have never worked?

14:46.027 --> 14:48.853
You can't land any aircraft that flies
by being full of hot air.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.129
I have been in a hot air balloon once,

14:51.130 --> 14:54.938
and  it landed by dragging itself side ways through a hedge

14:54.939 --> 14:58.635
in a field, I ended up jammed on the lady Mayoress in the basket.

14:58.981 --> 14:59.981
Long story, but I did it.

15:00.425 --> 15:03.105
I want to talk about lighter than air transport.

15:03.105 --> 15:05.483
I want to talk about the Lambo.

15:05.484 --> 15:06.582
Because.

15:07.013 --> 15:11.839
It is heroically daft, by going down from four-wheel to rear-wheel drive,

15:11.839 --> 15:16.089
it is bonkers, it is like free climbing rather than all the ropes and harness on.

15:16.090 --> 15:17.192
It's fabulous.

15:17.288 --> 15:21.845
Compared to, we must compare it, cause it's a rear-wheel drive, to a Ferrari 430?

15:21.845 --> 15:25.194
It is not as good, but it is better.

15:25.195 --> 15:26.766
I know what you mean.
It's the panther, it's the white stripe.

15:26.766 --> 15:28.756
Super car.
- It's just amazing.

15:28.757 --> 15:31.715
And of course you got to drive it a lot more than you thought,

15:31.715 --> 15:34.587
because of the freak weather conditions that blighted James,

15:34.587 --> 15:36.968
the light breezes.

15:39.243 --> 15:41.743
Light breezes? It was more like a Hurricane.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.423
Let's do the news.

15:46.424 --> 15:49.328
Now, the Danes have made announcement,

15:49.328 --> 15:51.355
they are going to start making a supercar.

15:51.356 --> 15:52.356
This is it.

15:52.357 --> 15:57.272
That is got a V8, supercharged and turbocharged,

15:57.272 --> 16:00.393
they say all of the components, where possible,

16:00.393 --> 16:04.753
are going to be made and  sourced by companies in Denmark.

16:04.753 --> 16:05.985
Really?
- Yes!

16:05.986 --> 16:08.135
Will it be made of bacon?

16:08.411 --> 16:11.718
Will it be lubricated with Lurpak? Cause that Danes.

16:12.211 --> 16:15.828
You know Bang & Olufsen? Beautiful Danish design,

16:15.828 --> 16:20.688
and inside it, as far as I'm aware, it's all Philips electronics?

16:20.689 --> 16:22.073
So that what it will be like.

16:22.283 --> 16:26.319
This will stop you buying pretty much everything they make, doesn't it?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.406
No,  I am a bit of a sucker for Bang & Olufsen.

16:28.407 --> 16:29.236
A bit?

16:29.237 --> 16:31.830
You have been in the new Audi?
New Audi got Bang & Olufsen speakers

16:31.831 --> 16:35.053
that rise up out of the dashboard when you turn the stereo on.

16:35.054 --> 16:37.703
I bet you're rising up with them.
- I am.

16:40.179 --> 16:43.391
It works like catnip on him, honestly if you give him a Bang & Olufsen stereo

16:43.391 --> 16:46.923
his front leg grab onto his chest and his back leg kicking like that.

16:46.924 --> 16:48.387
I love it! I love it!

16:48.388 --> 16:49.998
What's a catnip? What is catnip?

16:49.999 --> 16:51.539
Catnip, well if you got a cat.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.945
It's a herb you give to your cat and they just urghh!

16:53.946 --> 16:59.141
The only thing I want to give a cat is its name and address to my dogs.

17:03.048 --> 17:05.779
He said the other day when I said I was gonna sat my dog on his cat.

17:05.779 --> 17:07.538
Will he able to do it?

17:07.768 --> 17:11.569
Your gay dog comes around to see my cat.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.453
It would get its bloody head kicked in.

17:13.453 --> 17:16.523
The point is Bang & Olufsen brings me back to that car.

17:16.525 --> 17:19.526
Because I think that looks absolutely fanta...

17:19.527 --> 17:21.363
I don't care if it's made of bacon.

17:21.364 --> 17:23.765
What it's called?
- Bang & Lurpak.

17:24.980 --> 17:25.980
Now!

17:25.981 --> 17:27.894
I don't know if you saw the paper this week.

17:27.894 --> 17:32.486
A woman had a baby, while she was on her way to hospital in a Kia,

17:32.486 --> 17:37.565
they have called the baby Kia.

17:37.566 --> 17:40.471
It could have been worse, it could have been Proton.

17:42.247 --> 17:45.736
Because these people called their baby, Kia,

17:45.736 --> 17:49.932
Kia, the people who made the cars have actually given them a Kia car.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.854
We got the picture of the handover.

17:52.855 --> 17:56.432
This brings us on to a very important Top Gear, top tip.

17:56.433 --> 17:59.802
If you are on your way to hospital in Labour,

17:59.802 --> 18:04.412
and you're in a Kia, for God's sake get out.

18:04.413 --> 18:10.070
Let the child be Christened skip, bus stop, phone box, anything, just get out.

18:10.070 --> 18:14.009
I Christen this child, doorway of Currys.

18:14.009 --> 18:18.639
Because at least that way you get a free microwave and not a hidious car like that.

18:19.013 --> 18:21.675
I reckon this whole story and baby Kia here,

18:21.675 --> 18:24.278
it could spark a whole load of copy cats,

18:24.278 --> 18:27.132
cos a whole load of dads waiting until the due dates

18:27.133 --> 18:30.263
and then secretly hired a Lamborghini Murcielago

18:30.264 --> 18:35.100
and driving really slowly to hospital.
You alright darling, you can hang on.

18:35.101 --> 18:39.149
What are you called Pagani Zonda with the optional ceramic brake package?

18:40.239 --> 18:43.750
Now. Last weekend the three of us were in Middlesborough,

18:44.592 --> 18:46.736
on Saturday night we had to drive back to England,

18:46.737 --> 18:47.737
okay which mean going...

18:49.080 --> 18:50.973
You know what it mean.
Going down at the M1.

18:50.973 --> 18:55.126
The truth of the matter is all three of us had been away from home for six weeks,

18:55.126 --> 18:57.300
looking forward to seeing our families.

18:57.301 --> 19:03.599
Belting down the M1, you arrive in Leicestershire, and there is a 20-mile set of road works there.

19:04.213 --> 19:10.258
20 miles, which have average speed camera set at 50mph for the entire length.

19:10.258 --> 19:15.132
Traffic is light, there is no rain, it is three lanes, but you're forced to do 50.

19:15.345 --> 19:17.499
I don't know who the Minister of Transport is,

19:17.499 --> 19:21.469
but I want him to find the man who came up with that idea,

19:21.469 --> 19:22.958
go round to his office on Monday morning,

19:22.958 --> 19:25.606
and punch him really hard on the side of his head.

19:26.676 --> 19:31.149
Because if he doesn't, I'm going to find the man and attach him to a milling machine,

19:31.150 --> 19:35.293
and I'm gonna see if it is possible to turn a man's head into a perfect cube.

19:36.571 --> 19:38.545
Do you know why they have the 50mph speed limit?

19:38.546 --> 19:42.030
To protect the work force, who weren't there.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.578
They were in bed, where I wanted to be.

19:44.578 --> 19:47.541
I agree with you entirely. But the answer is not cubing people's heads,

19:47.542 --> 19:51.344
the answer is when the work force isn't there, do 70.

19:51.452 --> 19:52.889
Well you gonna just get nicked?

19:52.890 --> 19:54.851
No, but if everybody does 70.

19:54.851 --> 19:58.695
Who here would just do 70 through a set of road works with an average speed cameras?

19:59.092 --> 20:02.577
Nobody James. If you go charging through you just gonna get booked.

20:02.577 --> 20:06.066
But that's fine, you can test it.
Stay to 70 because that the speed limit.

20:06.066 --> 20:08.358
You take it to court in front of a jury,

20:08.358 --> 20:12.735
and you argue correctly that it is wrong to apply the 50mph speed limit,

20:12.735 --> 20:14.733
when there is nobody there to protect.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.250
So you are saying it is logic?

20:16.250 --> 20:17.303
It is logic.

20:17.304 --> 20:18.942
It is logic to kill Peter Mandelson.

20:18.943 --> 20:20.349
No it isn't.
- It is.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.014
It is, but you can't do it.

20:22.015 --> 20:24.642
Killing Peter Mandelson is a grey area,

20:24.642 --> 20:27.842
but doing 70mph on the motorway is an absolute.

20:27.842 --> 20:31.093
How many people went on the anti-war march?
A million, we went to war.

20:31.093 --> 20:35.652
How many people went on the countryside march?
400,000, and fox-hunting was still banned.

20:35.577 --> 20:37.875
The Government is not interested in the will of the people.

20:37.875 --> 20:41.568
Particularly if it is just one pedantic long-haired old Queen

20:41.569 --> 20:45.675
standing up in the court saying,
I did 70 because it's logical.

20:45.675 --> 20:48.107
You absolutely right. Speed limits in motorway can be a pain,

20:48.107 --> 20:50.910
and theres two solutions outlined for you.

20:50.911 --> 20:54.487
Revolution or cubing people's heads,

20:54.488 --> 20:57.446
or alternatively you could just leave a bit earlier.

20:57.446 --> 20:59.540
No, cube their heads.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.996
Leave five minutes earlier.

21:01.996 --> 21:04.542
It is not five minutes any way.
- It is five minutes a day.

21:05.196 --> 21:07.724
Anyone here from Leicestershire?
Is anyone here?

21:07.725 --> 21:08.725
How did you get here, Jesus!

21:10.366 --> 21:12.254
Jesus lives in Leicestershire.

21:12.255 --> 21:15.807
He's Jesus, come here, Jesus, come and talk to me.

21:16.086 --> 21:18.665
Congratulations.
- Thank you!

21:18.665 --> 21:22.829
It's slightly bigger news than the M1 but nevertheless let's gloss over the second coming,

21:22.829 --> 21:25.705
do you commute on the road?
- I go the back way.

21:25.705 --> 21:26.800
Because of that?
- Yeah.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.349
So how much does it add to your transport every day?

21:30.337 --> 21:31.551
Ten minutes, quarter of an hour.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.423
Ten minutes a day?
- Each way.

21:33.424 --> 21:34.647
Each way, five days a week?

21:34.937 --> 21:37.398
So that's an hour 40 minutes a week,

21:37.399 --> 21:40.094
the Government is stealing from Jesus.

21:41.940 --> 21:42.940
That's right.

21:44.190 --> 21:45.896
Thank you Jesus for showing up.

21:49.366 --> 21:53.594
Gordon Brown is stealing an hour and 40 minutes from Jesus.

21:54.048 --> 21:56.608
Any way, time to move on.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.276
Because last week we asked you to nominate

21:59.277 --> 22:01.994
the car-maker that you thought over the years

22:01.994 --> 22:04.874
has made the largest number of great cars.

22:04.875 --> 22:08.894
There have been a couple of quite interesting nominations,

22:08.895 --> 22:11.216
one was Matchbox.
- That was a surprise.

22:11.217 --> 22:12.410
Pretty clever actually I thought.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.714
The other was James May,

22:14.715 --> 22:17.678
he actually tied with Chrysler.

22:18.073 --> 22:20.802
It was weird cos he only ever made one great car, James,

22:20.802 --> 22:22.590
the Eagle Hamthrust.

22:24.245 --> 22:26.830
This is the top ten, as you can see we have Ferrari,

22:26.830 --> 22:31.409
Lamborghini, coming up now we have the top three, here they are.

22:31.410 --> 22:33.900
Thank you, automatic board.

22:33.901 --> 22:34.743
Cost a lot of money.

22:35.351 --> 22:39.526
And, in third place, according to you, the voters.

22:40.614 --> 22:42.316
BMW, third place.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.462
In second place, even though they made

22:44.463 --> 22:46.949
the worst car in the history of the world ever,

22:46.949 --> 22:49.752
the Beatle, it is VW.

22:49.753 --> 22:51.831
No applauding that.

22:52.591 --> 22:57.350
You can applaud this if you like, the winner is Ford.

22:57.351 --> 22:58.351
So that is it.

23:02.989 --> 23:05.918
The thing is, though, you're wrong.

23:06.492 --> 23:08.269
Ford hasn't won this at all.

23:08.270 --> 23:12.187
Because we reckoned Ford has made four great cars over the years.

23:12.221 --> 23:15.743
But the car company we think is at the top of this list has made seven.

23:16.335 --> 23:18.575
The car company we got in mind, okay,

23:18.575 --> 23:22.443
there were 350 million people watching last week's show

23:22.444 --> 23:24.064
when we asked you to vote.

23:24.064 --> 23:26.775
The number of people who voted for,

23:26.776 --> 23:29.493
what we think is the greatest car company in the world was nine.

23:30.228 --> 23:32.574
Not nine million. Just nine.

23:32.574 --> 23:35.280
Just nine. No ideas?

23:35.281 --> 23:36.895
Made some of the prettiest cars ever.

23:36.896 --> 23:38.653
Let me put it this way, okay.

23:38.950 --> 23:42.495
Mitsubishi has won the World Rally Championship once,

23:42.495 --> 23:45.156
Subaru three times, Ford three times,

23:45.156 --> 23:48.205
the company we have in mind won it ten times.

23:49.154 --> 23:52.672
No, silence. OK then, watch this.

23:55.977 --> 24:01.681
This is a collection of art, of madness, of brilliance.

24:02.030 --> 24:05.477
This is a collection of pornography,

24:05.478 --> 24:09.846
this is a collections of Lancias.

24:10.861 --> 24:17.763
But this annoyingly, is the Lancia people remember best of all, The Beta.

24:18.532 --> 24:24.259
It was made from steel so thin that on a windy day it would actually change shape.

24:24.260 --> 24:27.350
And it wasn't much cop in the rain either.

24:27.351 --> 24:29.057
I mean, this was fine yesterday,

24:29.057 --> 24:31.236
but then this morning we had a bit of a shower

24:31.236 --> 24:33.557
and now look at it.

24:36.143 --> 24:39.693
The fact is though, that all Lancias had problems.

24:40.093 --> 24:44.763
The Gamma, for instance, exploded every time you turned the steering wheel.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.631
And then, there was the Fulvia.

24:55.444 --> 24:58.435
It is a fantastic little car this.

25:00.001 --> 25:03.758
It's like driving a wroughty sorbet.

25:04.925 --> 25:08.774
With its clever V4 engine, Fulvia was actually the first Lancia,

25:08.775 --> 25:12.035
to win the World Rally Championship.

25:12.292 --> 25:14.306
The thing is, though, when all is said and done,

25:14.306 --> 25:19.887
it was a very small, 1.3 litre, front-wheel drive, two-door saloon car.

25:19.887 --> 25:25.799
But it cost when it was new, more than an E Type Jaguar.

25:27.289 --> 25:32.331
We forgave the Fulvia the silly price tag though, because what made it great,

25:32.331 --> 25:39.270
the same thing that made all Lancia's great, the way it looked.

25:39.796 --> 25:45.808
It really is as pretty as the sunseting over Charlize Theron.

25:48.752 --> 25:50.855
In its day, this was too.

25:50.856 --> 25:56.427
The streamlined Aprilia, the first car to be designed in a wind tunnel.

25:57.684 --> 26:01.187
Inevitably there were problems.
For example.

26:01.188 --> 26:03.611
The doors opened like this, that was lovely

26:03.611 --> 26:05.805
it meant getting in and out was very easy.

26:05.806 --> 26:07.453
However, when they were closed

26:07.454 --> 26:12.450
they didn't quite meet, so quite a lot of weather could get inside as you drove along.

26:12.747 --> 26:15.475
And it was only made with right-hand drive,

26:15.476 --> 26:17.908
which is fine fine in Britain and Sweden,

26:17.908 --> 26:21.205
which drove on the left at the time, but it was quite annoying everywhere else.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.658
And then there was the Monte Carlo.

26:28.343 --> 26:33.246
This was a wonderful car, a mid-engineed mini-Ferrari.

26:33.763 --> 26:36.327
But because it was actually a Lancia,

26:36.328 --> 26:41.040
the things that were right were balanced out by the things that were wrong.

26:41.607 --> 26:43.396
If you so much as looked at the middle pedal,

26:43.397 --> 26:45.673
the brakes would lock up and you would crash into a tree.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.779
Lancia took the thing very seriously,

26:48.779 --> 26:52.120
so much so they stopped production for two years

26:52.121 --> 26:54.333
whilst they looked for a solution.

26:54.333 --> 26:59.358
And they found one. What they did was remove the brake servo,

26:59.358 --> 27:01.826
so then it had no brakes at all.

27:03.969 --> 27:05.247
And...

27:09.556 --> 27:12.621
The Monte Carlo then was quite dangerous.

27:12.621 --> 27:14.360
But in that Lancia way,

27:14.361 --> 27:19.390
it was so pretty I wanted one more than I wanted my next breath.

27:24.430 --> 27:28.229
Sometimes, though, Lancia's lunacy did produce results.

27:29.332 --> 27:35.656
Did you know Lancia was the first car company ever to sell a car with a monocoque?

27:35.656 --> 27:38.345
They were the first to offer a five-speed gear box.

27:38.345 --> 27:43.656
First to sell a car with supercharging and turbocharging on the same engine.

27:43.656 --> 27:46.354
First to sell a car with a V6 engine.

27:46.839 --> 27:50.946
First to sell a car with an electric boot spoiler.

27:50.947 --> 27:53.875
They did all these significant mechanical firsts,

27:53.876 --> 27:57.088
yet still, if you say to anyone a Lancia,

27:57.089 --> 27:59.148
they just snigger and say they fall apart.

27:59.148 --> 28:00.864
I know, it is ridiculous.

28:02.058 --> 28:05.396
Holy moly, does the bumper come off?

28:05.397 --> 28:08.091
I believe it has.

28:08.707 --> 28:12.402
You need to define greatness, that is the important thing.

28:12.402 --> 28:15.725
Just because something is unreliable. Oh,

28:15.725 --> 28:18.877
it doesn't mean it isn't great.

28:18.878 --> 28:19.878
Stephen Hawkins, great bloke, even though a lot of him doesn't work.

28:24.797 --> 28:26.831
Yeah. I wouldn't break it to him like that.

28:26.831 --> 28:30.867
But the principal stands. The principle stands.

28:30.868 --> 28:34.925
Meryl Streep, everybody says she's a great actress,

28:34.925 --> 28:39.342
and then she appears in Mama Mia, the worst film ever made.

28:39.342 --> 28:42.160
She's still a great actress.

28:42.565 --> 28:45.142
Have you seen Mama Mia?
- Yes I have.

28:45.143 --> 28:46.821
You big girl.

28:47.673 --> 28:52.295
To prove even the tattiest Lancia is tougher than you might think,

28:52.832 --> 28:57.491
we have bought this 1982HPE.

28:57.492 --> 29:03.729
And I shall now drive it non- stop through the night on a rough rally stage.

29:06.668 --> 29:10.467
And I shall be racing, not racing, been told about that, dangerous,

29:10.467 --> 29:15.676
driving at the same time, on the same track in a similar vintage car.

29:15.676 --> 29:18.391
This Morris Marina.

29:18.392 --> 29:21.580
Right, Hammond, winner, last one still running.

29:21.817 --> 29:23.098
Fair enough.

29:23.099 --> 29:24.479
Let's do it!

29:35.543 --> 29:37.532
This is not a promising start,

29:37.533 --> 29:41.554
dispelling the myth that Lancias were not very good.

29:45.205 --> 29:48.280
Yes!
- Never doubted it.

29:49.305 --> 29:53.369
Obviously, the Marina won't work because this foul hateful things are hopeless.

30:04.547 --> 30:07.574
Now, you might be saying, it's a Morris Marina,

30:07.575 --> 30:09.114
a piano is going to fall on it.

30:10.259 --> 30:12.534
The more eagle eye viewer might have spotted it.

30:12.535 --> 30:14.389
I've taken a precaution.

30:14.389 --> 30:17.092
I bought a Marina which already are a piano landed on it.

30:17.093 --> 30:18.093
Job done!

30:19.079 --> 30:24.585
Since we're doing serious research, we agreed there would be no childish racing.

30:24.585 --> 30:26.881
I've hit Hammond!

30:26.882 --> 30:29.493
I've hit Hammond!

30:29.494 --> 30:30.494
That's OK, OK!

30:30.495 --> 30:36.795
Proving what a fine and strong breed of car the Lancia always was.

30:37.316 --> 30:41.049
I'm gonna hit Jeremy as he goes round this really difficult corner.

30:42.030 --> 30:47.106
He's got the outside there. He'll never get by, and he hasn't.

30:47.106 --> 30:50.023
But we're not racing, we're not racing.

30:52.106 --> 30:55.759
He's through. While I got my sun visor out of the way.

30:59.556 --> 31:05.409
For hour after hour, we continued continued to not race around the rally stage.

31:06.228 --> 31:12.091
As you can see. It's pretty close to dark, still literally no faults to report.

31:12.092 --> 31:13.896
Absolutely nothing.

31:14.468 --> 31:17.662
Eventually, after not racing some more,

31:18.989 --> 31:23.420
the Marina began to pull ahead.

31:24.317 --> 31:28.257
It's of course a well-known fact that a piano on the roof

31:28.257 --> 31:33.032
aids traction and gives you more speed on a rally-special stage.

31:33.505 --> 31:37.363
But then, predictably, it broke down.

31:38.016 --> 31:41.216
So I went to get some tools to try and fix it.

31:41.907 --> 31:46.017
There he is! It's Hammond! He's out! He's down!

31:55.067 --> 32:00.048
The Lancia soldiered on alone, but then I got a warning light.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.715
Literally.

32:01.716 --> 32:02.716
Oh no!

32:03.104 --> 32:04.104
Look!

32:04.864 --> 32:07.283
I can't see through through the flames!

32:07.284 --> 32:08.958
I've got to blow this out somehow.

32:10.264 --> 32:13.820
Maybe if I sped up like in Memphis Belle.

32:14.263 --> 32:15.263
Come on!

32:16.121 --> 32:19.901
No, that's not working. I can't see anything.

32:20.129 --> 32:25.067
No matter, though, because here's proof that Lancias are tough and strong,

32:25.067 --> 32:27.032
and dependable.

32:29.457 --> 32:30.430
So now,

32:30.431 --> 32:32.531
can we please move on.

32:37.752 --> 32:39.954
This is a Stratos.

32:39.954 --> 32:44.784
It had a 2.4 litre Ferrari V6 mounted in the middle.

32:44.785 --> 32:48.939
It was Italian, it was styled by Bertone

32:48.940 --> 32:52.276
and it was completely impractical. 

32:53.005 --> 32:56.301
It therefore ticked all the supercar boxes.

32:56.336 --> 33:04.197
But unlike any other supercar before or since, 
it wasn't designed to be parked in Monte Carlo.

33:04.419 --> 33:08.999
It was designed to get there like this.

33:10.881 --> 33:13.872
It's absurdly short wheel base meant it was agile,

33:13.872 --> 33:16.574
and the Ferrari power meant it was fast,

33:16.575 --> 33:21.391
so fast that it won the world rally championship three times.

33:23.608 --> 33:27.342
And joy of joys, they made 500 Stratoses.

33:27.343 --> 33:29.965
For people to buy.

33:39.235 --> 33:40.235
That's a proper noise.

33:41.573 --> 33:45.179
What a fantastic car!

33:47.082 --> 33:49.876
Of course, there were a few problems with it.

33:49.876 --> 33:54.073
Chief among which was a lack of space inside.

33:54.073 --> 33:57.970
A gynaecologist would get in here and go, "I'm at work!"

33:57.970 --> 34:03.853
It's like climbing into somebody else's giant red posing pouch.

34:03.853 --> 34:06.254
James May's!

34:06.255 --> 34:07.323
Time for a gear change.

34:07.719 --> 34:10.831
Stop touching my knee.
- You try changing gear.

34:11.681 --> 34:14.929
You got to. I'm going to change gear now.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.501
This will involve man touching.

34:18.271 --> 34:21.774
And the list of faults doesn't end with the tiny cockpit.

34:21.774 --> 34:25.231
Why did it give the passenger the pedals and the driver the wheels?

34:25.266 --> 34:27.828
I don't know. They're definitely over to the right-hand side.

34:27.828 --> 34:31.467
You're sort of sitting a bit sideways.

34:31.998 --> 34:36.812
These window winders, it's...
- Not very good.

34:37.780 --> 34:39.650
The other thing I really like as well is,

34:39.650 --> 34:43.591
you know a Porsche puts the rev counter right in front of you,

34:43.591 --> 34:47.379
Lancia in this put the oil pressure right in front of you. 

34:47.414 --> 34:49.034
What does that tell you?

34:49.616 --> 34:52.246
So, not perfect.

34:58.248 --> 35:01.946
But then you look at it and there's the thing,

35:01.947 --> 35:04.225
because it just sort of this.

35:06.272 --> 35:09.231
This is one of the best cars ever made.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.822
I would go with that.

35:10.822 --> 35:12.832
On the grounds of its achievement,

35:12.833 --> 35:16.373
but also that slightly more subjective thing of how gorgeous it looks.

35:16.785 --> 35:17.785
Stop doing that to my knee.

35:18.059 --> 35:19.501
Just move your leg.
- That was a stroke!

35:20.512 --> 35:22.171
Move it!
- I can't.

35:25.619 --> 35:28.418
After the Stratos, came the 037,

35:28.418 --> 35:33.464
the last two-wheel drive car to win the world rally championship.

35:35.845 --> 35:40.852
And the only two-wheel drive car to beat the mighty Audi Quattro.

35:47.055 --> 35:52.646
The thing is, though, no-one really remember the 037.

35:55.959 --> 36:02.715
Then there's the Thema 832, Lancia's answer to the BMW M5.

36:02.715 --> 36:04.778
No one really remembers this either,

36:04.779 --> 36:09.867
even though it had a fully fledged Ferrari V8 under the bonnet.

36:12.804 --> 36:16.838
We don't really remember any of Lancia's seven great cars,

36:16.838 --> 36:20.768
and all because of what happen in 1980.

36:23.155 --> 36:26.870
Lancia was forced by pressure from the media to spend a fortune

36:26.870 --> 36:33.177
buying back rusty Betas, scrapping them and giving their owners brand new cars.

36:33.277 --> 36:37.241
It was a PR disaster.

36:38.255 --> 36:41.995
In Britain, Lancia's reputation was ruined.

36:41.996 --> 36:47.316
And in 1994, they pulled out of the market altogether.

36:56.254 --> 37:02.262
However, before the most charismatic car maker of them all finally went,

37:02.262 --> 37:08.928
they left us with one final reminder of what they can do when they try.

37:15.945 --> 37:17.661
This is a Delta Integrale.

37:17.662 --> 37:19.660
A four wheel drive turbo charged rally car,

37:19.660 --> 37:24.785
that picked up where Fulvia and the Stratos and the 037 left off.

37:30.162 --> 37:34.521
This thing won the world rally championship six times on the trot

37:34.521 --> 37:36.867
- six times!

37:37.457 --> 37:41.673
And you can feel that DNA in here.

37:42.825 --> 37:46.512
The steering is so neat, precise.

37:50.922 --> 37:53.235
Feel it settles into a turn and just gripped

37:53.236 --> 37:55.758
just pulled itself back into a corner.

38:17.781 --> 38:20.334
Having learned their lesson with the Aprilia,

38:20.334 --> 38:25.600
Lancia weren't going to be stupid enough to make these in a right-hand drive,

38:26.237 --> 38:28.416
so they made them left-hand drive -

38:28.417 --> 38:31.239
only.

38:34.622 --> 38:36.992
Only Lancia.

38:37.767 --> 38:43.887
Despite this, a good one of these today is worth 25,000 pounds.

38:45.134 --> 38:47.437
And I'm not surprised.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.985
Because this is a very unusual Lancia.

38:52.020 --> 38:55.462
It wasn't very pretty,

38:55.463 --> 38:58.240
but, God, it was good.

39:08.606 --> 39:09.606
Unbelievable.

39:10.348 --> 39:14.086
I actually want one. I'm standing here thinking "I want that".

39:15.198 --> 39:19.028
What I love about Lancia is that they never once just said,

39:19.028 --> 39:21.153
"Let's just make a medium car".

39:21.154 --> 39:23.057
They were always doing experiments.

39:23.057 --> 39:25.926
Some of the experiments worked and some some didn't.

39:25.927 --> 39:27.240
That's the nature of it. They might take...

39:27.240 --> 39:30.449
Could we make an engine with seven-and-a-half cylinders.

39:30.549 --> 39:33.672
Or let's see if we can make the windows go up and down not with electricity,

39:33.673 --> 39:37.218
but with magic. Abracadabra! No, hasn't worked.

39:37.218 --> 39:38.272
But sell it anyway.

39:39.059 --> 39:40.891
And that's what made them so magnificent.

39:40.891 --> 39:43.291
They are still going today but now they are just

39:43.291 --> 39:46.583
a division of Fiat making things like this,

39:46.584 --> 39:49.290
which is neither very pretty nor very good.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.427
What it is in essence is a Fiat Bravo

39:51.427 --> 39:54.966
with Rio Ferdinand's face stuck on the front.

39:54.967 --> 39:56.116
But fear not.

39:56.116 --> 39:58.478
If you still hanker over the glory days,

39:58.479 --> 39:59.414
then later on in the show,

39:59.415 --> 40:01.889
we have something to warm the cockles of your heart.

40:01.889 --> 40:05.904
But now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

40:05.939 --> 40:09.437
My guest tonight is a broadcasting legend.

40:09.437 --> 40:12.674
He also has an astonishing collection of cars.

40:12.675 --> 40:16.231
I list for you here: Ferrari 599,

40:16.231 --> 40:23.043
Ferrari F40, Ferrari California, Ferrari Enzo, Ferrari 288 GTO,

40:23.043 --> 40:29.466
Ferrari 308 GTS, Ferrari 246 Dino, Ferrari 275 GTB quad cam.

40:29.467 --> 40:35.636
Ferrari 250 GT California short wheel base, Ferrari 250 GT California long wheel base.

40:35.636 --> 40:40.529
So, let's find out if there is any particular type of car he likes.

40:40.629 --> 40:42.388
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Evans.

40:44.049 --> 40:46.474
How are you?
Good going! How are you?

40:46.475 --> 40:49.007
Very well, you've grown up.
Chris Evans.

40:50.188 --> 40:52.024
Have a seat, mate. Have a seat.

40:53.906 --> 40:57.243
Presumably, you disagree with our greatest car verdict, then?

40:57.244 --> 40:58.768
Quelle surprise.

40:58.768 --> 41:02.217
Lancia. You don't believe that presumably, judging by your collection

41:02.217 --> 41:04.997
that there are particularly a brilliant maker of motor cars.

41:04.998 --> 41:07.544
What? A car falling to bits the best mark in the world?

41:07.545 --> 41:08.545
Yes!

41:08.546 --> 41:10.182
Are you mad? Are you mental?

41:10.183 --> 41:13.247
Lancia's only came in black and rust!

41:13.248 --> 41:16.156
I still stand by - There's more Lancia I like to..
- Oh come on!

41:17.432 --> 41:20.095
The number of Ferraris I would like to own now is one.

41:20.096 --> 41:22.511
What about the A60 Monza, what about the 750 Monza?

41:22.512 --> 41:25.389
What about the 850 Monza? What about the PF250?

41:25.390 --> 41:27.013
What about the four-cam?

41:27.014 --> 41:28.404
What about the...

41:29.108 --> 41:32.292
A lot of people write and complain this isn't a car show anymore.

41:32.292 --> 41:33.566
It is now!

41:34.792 --> 41:38.557
I love this enthusiasm. Why have you painted all yours white?

41:38.557 --> 41:41.542
Because I wanted them to match. I wanted them to be a work of art.

41:41.882 --> 41:45.921
I've got a white garage or "car house" as they're sometimes known.

41:46.205 --> 41:49.538
It's got a white piano in it, right?

41:49.539 --> 41:54.208
That plays itself, and there are these eight beautiful white Farrarris.

41:54.209 --> 41:55.481
And I've got them matching number plates.

41:56.686 --> 42:00.252
Which led you to that auction. When you bid for the Ferrari California.

42:00.253 --> 42:01.841
The James Coburn's car.
- Yes.

42:01.842 --> 42:03.597
This is terribly vulgar.

42:03.598 --> 42:05.419
How much did you pay for that?

42:05.419 --> 42:08.169
It was the most expensive car sold at auction in the world.

42:08.169 --> 42:10.456
When I bought it.
- Last year?

42:10.457 --> 42:13.415
A lot of millions?
- Yes, 12 millions dollars.

42:14.611 --> 42:17.538
How drunk were you?
- I wasn't drunk at all.

42:17.538 --> 42:22.744
The point is, I didn't go to buy the car. I went to buy a poster.

42:22.745 --> 42:23.827
I'm not joking! I'm not joking!

42:23.828 --> 42:25.446
I went to buy a poster, and...

42:25.676 --> 42:28.417
The 250 Spider came up on the stand,

42:28.418 --> 42:30.445
my second favourite car in the world

42:30.445 --> 42:32.915
because it was in my Top Trumps collection.

42:32.916 --> 42:34.049
As simple as that.

42:34.050 --> 42:36.878
Because that how this thing works and that's how life is sometime

42:36.878 --> 42:37.978
I thought I would go for it.

42:37.979 --> 42:40.221
Because I always wanted one. That was the best one in the world,

42:40.221 --> 42:42.407
James Coburn owned it for 28 years.

42:42.408 --> 42:45.561
He bought it because Steve McQueen, he met Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.

42:45.973 --> 42:48.799
Talking about this makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.101
It's all documented, I've got all the history

42:51.101 --> 42:54.208
and that baby is back in the garage at home.

42:54.209 --> 42:55.782
I show it to as many people as I can.

42:55.783 --> 42:56.535
Unbelievable.

42:56.536 --> 42:59.580
Now. I was listening to you the other day, listen to you everday

42:59.580 --> 43:03.231
whilst stuck in a traffic jam, and you've auctioned

43:03.231 --> 43:05.272
your entire collection of Ferraris,

43:05.273 --> 43:08.246
most of your collections of Ferraris, for Children In Need.
- Yes.

43:08.247 --> 43:09.662
So how does that work?

43:09.663 --> 43:12.567
People ring in and they were bidding?
- Yes.

43:12.568 --> 43:13.984
And then they can drive whichever one they want?

43:13.984 --> 43:18.312
What happen is, we take the seven highest bids on the day

43:18.312 --> 43:22.658
and they spend a four-day tour and during the four days,

43:22.793 --> 43:26.823
each person who's bid the amount of money gets to drive every single car.

43:26.823 --> 43:29.050
Isn't that terrifying from your point of view?

43:29.659 --> 43:32.752
It's only tin and rubber. And I think the great thing about this kind of cars.

43:32.787 --> 43:35.105
If anybody comes round to my house, whether they're fitting a carpet,

43:35.105 --> 43:37.622
do the garden, burgling,

43:38.353 --> 43:41.070
just before you take that, come and have a look at the cars.

43:41.105 --> 43:43.232
I think it's really important to share these cars with people.

43:44.895 --> 43:48.066
You don't know who's bid. You know their names.

43:48.067 --> 43:50.269
You could have any sort of ape turning up.

43:51.085 --> 43:52.818
Well, if you bid...

43:56.661 --> 43:59.436
You've got a book out.
"It's not what you think".

43:59.884 --> 44:01.290
Which is what it's called.
- Yes.

44:01.465 --> 44:04.456
And there's a list of everything at the beginning of every chapter.

44:04.457 --> 44:05.457
Top tens.
- The top tens.

44:05.458 --> 44:07.633
Which is great. A man loves the top tens.

44:07.634 --> 44:08.906
We like to quantify everything.

44:09.057 --> 44:11.739
But this car business, it does seem to me that cars,

44:11.739 --> 44:13.965
you sometimes claim you're not a car man,

44:13.966 --> 44:15.393
but you bloody well are.

44:15.394 --> 44:16.845
No, I'm definitely a car man.

44:16.845 --> 44:21.298
Behind my family, my job, maybe you're not not going to like this

44:21.299 --> 44:25.389
maybe golf, then I am a car man.

44:25.390 --> 44:27.454
Sometimes, if I'm away from home,

44:27.454 --> 44:29.345
the first thing I do, I get back home

44:29.346 --> 44:31.910
and I have to go to garage just to have a smell.

44:31.910 --> 44:34.702
I love it. The smell of petrol and leather,

44:34.702 --> 44:40.099
I love it to death. It's better than stuff I've never tried.

44:42.225 --> 44:43.911
Okay, now.

44:43.911 --> 44:46.228
When I first met you about a million years ago,
- Yes.

44:46.228 --> 44:49.124
you were definitely a Porsche man.

44:49.124 --> 44:51.575
You are having a laugh!
You have 968..

44:51.576 --> 44:54.927
You've lost your mind. You need to go to Venice -

44:55.143 --> 44:57.805
Did you have a 968?
- No.

44:57.806 --> 45:01.766
You did, convertible, Big Breakfast.
- I didn't have 968.

45:01.767 --> 45:05.977
It wasn't 968, cos 968 was Tiptronic and mine was manual.

45:06.012 --> 45:08.287
So it was a 944?

45:08.288 --> 45:12.588
It was a 944 drop top, 19 grand, it was a great car,

45:12.588 --> 45:16.380
but it was dull and boring because it was a Porsche.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.839
Obviously, the big news is,

45:18.839 --> 45:23.298
that Chris Evans -- broadcasting air waves so many years,

45:23.298 --> 45:26.669
is about to take over from the Terry Master.

45:26.669 --> 45:29.969
Has he given you any advice about morning stuff?

45:29.970 --> 45:32.121
How to get up earlier, that's gonna be the number one.

45:32.122 --> 45:36.041
Terry doesn't get up early, Terry gets up at 7 that's not a breakfast show.

45:36.041 --> 45:39.371
What time do you started?
- 7.00am.

45:40.057 --> 45:42.824
It is quite funny. Because you gonna have to pretend to be older than you actually are.

45:42.825 --> 45:45.342
No I'm not, because for somebody at 60.

45:45.343 --> 45:48.156
We had a request the other day, at somebody 60th birthday,

45:48.157 --> 45:50.831
they wanted Van Halen, because that is the music that was around when they were sixties.

45:50.832 --> 45:53.104
So we are okay, I mean there's quality tune about.

45:53.105 --> 45:57.114
You have Brian Johnson on the show, lead of AC/DC. 62 years old.

45:57.115 --> 45:58.656
It's all fine.

45:58.656 --> 46:01.040
It is all fine, we are all going to be, bye-bye generation

46:01.040 --> 46:04.806
we are going to be in our old people's home with Anarchy In The UK in our wheelchairs.

46:04.807 --> 46:08.073
We gonna have a wheelchair and we still gonna be doing that.

46:08.074 --> 46:10.146
I am the antichrist.

46:10.146 --> 46:11.120
Give me a wheelchair.

46:11.121 --> 46:13.683
I don't want any more Gracie Fields, just this.

46:15.824 --> 46:18.840
How did it go for you, out there today on our lap?

46:18.840 --> 46:24.050
Well I did my best, probably the worst weather there has ever been out there.

46:24.075 --> 46:27.485
The Stig, what a lovely man, he couldn't have been nicer,

46:27.485 --> 46:31.509
however, what I have decided to do, I have had a great time.

46:31.897 --> 46:35.147
I thought if I'm going to die, let me die today on this track.

46:35.147 --> 46:41.022
He did actually say, Chris has no sense of self-preservation.

46:42.436 --> 46:47.304
Anybody like to see some of Chris's practices.

46:46.796 --> 46:50.412
Let's have a look at some of these practice thing here.

46:50.413 --> 46:51.413
At the 50 mark, turning,

46:52.436 --> 46:56.100
off the brakes again, brake hard now, into in to second.

46:56.101 --> 46:58.156
This is the hammerhead.

46:58.156 --> 47:01.396
You're going out of control, go out of control.

47:03.648 --> 47:06.171
Nobody has ever spun there before.

47:06.172 --> 47:07.292
That's good.

47:07.293 --> 47:10.264
Watch this.
This is the last corner.

47:10.734 --> 47:11.703
Sideways.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.900
Nobody has ever spun there.
- Sideways at the cruise.

47:13.901 --> 47:17.458
Second last corner, everybody goes here,

47:17.458 --> 47:18.736
I'm impressed.

47:18.737 --> 47:21.280
You never even made it to the corner.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.614
I thought I would just go straight on here.

47:23.615 --> 47:25.459
That was brilliant.

47:25.756 --> 47:29.878
That is good bravery.

47:32.958 --> 47:38.063
But then, the lap happened for real.
Who wants to see it?

47:38.064 --> 47:39.064
Let's have a look.

47:41.670 --> 47:44.694
So you haven't learned your lesson, still going for brute force.

47:44.694 --> 47:47.400
Come on, hello family.

47:48.159 --> 47:49.159
Concentrate, man.

47:49.283 --> 47:52.316
Concentrate on the job in hand, that is wet.

47:52.317 --> 47:54.660
Good, it's Joe 90 mind the wheel.

47:54.661 --> 47:55.905
Cutting across the red and white.

47:55.905 --> 47:59.754
That is slippery. You're looking quite good though.

47:59.754 --> 48:01.858
You have never been good at anything like this in your life,

48:01.859 --> 48:03.629
try and have a go at this.
Come on!

48:03.629 --> 48:07.425
Have you never been good at anything?
- Not like this though.

48:07.709 --> 48:10.669
I'm with you, all sports are impossible.

48:10.670 --> 48:12.789
That is not bad.
- You have to nail hammerhead.

48:13.323 --> 48:18.391
You got to do this, even though your chin does look like a bum!

48:18.391 --> 48:20.719
This is Hammerhead, do we gonna get around this time?

48:20.720 --> 48:22.645
We have put cones out now when it's rain

48:22.646 --> 48:26.128
so Jonathan Ross doesn't get lost if he comes back,

48:26.510 --> 48:29.104
you're in the white lines, that looks slow but important for a quick time.

48:29.104 --> 48:30.518
Aim for the cameraman.

48:30.519 --> 48:31.257
Aim for the cameraman.

48:31.258 --> 48:32.258
Here the cameraman.

48:32.259 --> 48:33.259
Bad karma.

48:33.260 --> 48:36.417
Because I missed the gear aiming for the cameraman.

48:36.418 --> 48:39.990
There he is,
he getting a bit tired now.

48:41.317 --> 48:42.530
That's looking good.

48:42.531 --> 48:46.228
The smell of the clutch. Mmmm.

48:46.229 --> 48:48.368
But does it smell of victory?

48:48.368 --> 48:52.005
I'm being a bit chicky, I'm being a whussy into the final bend.

48:52.006 --> 48:53.073
Come on now!

48:53.073 --> 48:57.381
Cut the corner, just a bit. That's the trick. That's good.

48:57.827 --> 49:01.191
That's quite a lot. This one, cut it a lot.

49:02.069 --> 49:07.769
So an entirely new way across the line.

49:07.869 --> 49:12.390
Here we are. There's the board.

49:12.391 --> 49:13.694
There is the board.

49:13.694 --> 49:17.024
Where do you think? Obviously we will give you a wet lap there.

49:17.024 --> 49:19.123
We will put Chris Evans "wet" on it.

49:19.124 --> 49:20.969
Where do you think you have come?

49:20.969 --> 49:25.512
I don't think it's that impressive, but I did, I promise you I try my best,

49:25.512 --> 49:29.036
but I'm not gonna lean forward, I will try to be cool.

49:29.037 --> 49:31.269
We never had a guest who manage to stay just like that.

49:31.270 --> 49:34.658
I know, I tell you my heart is racing.

49:35.173 --> 49:40.881
You did it in one minute, quicker than Terry Wogan was.

49:41.342 --> 49:46.321
You are already the new fastest Radio Two breakfast show host we have ever had.

49:46.321 --> 49:47.703
In the last 40 years.

49:49.851 --> 49:55.104
You did it in one minute, forty.
- That's good.

49:55.105 --> 49:56.625
Eight point one.

49:56.625 --> 50:05.054
For a wet lap that's the third- fastest wet lap we have ever had.

50:05.687 --> 50:07.032
There's your ex.

50:07.033 --> 50:08.337
I'm just above her,

50:08.338 --> 50:10.528
but I'm not on top of her, just above her.

50:11.734 --> 50:12.461
Cos she's my ex.

50:12.462 --> 50:15.148
But we were accused of favouritism with her by David Tenant,

50:15.148 --> 50:17.531
who said that we only allowed her to cut corner

50:17.532 --> 50:19.707
because she was wearing a see-through top.

50:19.708 --> 50:22.202
And he was quite right of course.
- Completely right.

50:22.203 --> 50:26.560
But you cut corners as well.
- Next time I'm gonna wear a see-through top.

50:27.133 --> 50:30.435
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Evans. Best of luck.

50:32.345 --> 50:34.640
The new morning man.

50:34.641 --> 50:36.848
That is a good time, be proud of that.

50:41.118 --> 50:44.876
Earlier on in the show, we explained that Lancia,

50:44.876 --> 50:47.775
the greatest car company in the world,

50:47.776 --> 50:51.813
and just because of a few problems with rust 30 years ago,

50:51.813 --> 50:54.875
they are not available in the UK any more.

50:55.122 --> 50:57.739
The thing is though, as Jeremy as been finding out,

50:57.739 --> 51:01.817
you can still get one, sort of.

51:04.926 --> 51:09.926
This is a Lancia Stratos, except for one small thing,

51:09.927 --> 51:10.927
It isn't.

51:13.438 --> 51:16.532
It wasn't made in the 1970s in Italy,

51:16.532 --> 51:19.162
in fact, I don't know where it was made.

51:19.163 --> 51:21.544
In a shed in Nuneaton, probably.

51:23.319 --> 51:26.085
This, you see, is a kit car.

51:26.086 --> 51:30.191
Either you can pay someone to build it for you,

51:30.191 --> 51:34.140
or you can make it at home yourself, with a hammer.

51:35.037 --> 51:39.737
Apparently, if you're fairly competent that would take about 300 hours,

51:39.231 --> 51:44.869
obviously it would take me about 300 years, which is a very long time.

51:44.869 --> 51:50.230
But, there is an upside, an original Stratos would cost

51:50.230 --> 51:52.351
100,000 pounds, maybe more,

51:52.352 --> 51:56.399
that is 13,000 pounds.

52:01.413 --> 52:06.966
In theory that makes this the Hawk HF, the bargain of the century.

52:06.966 --> 52:11.450
The body is absolutely identical to the original,

52:11.451 --> 52:14.994
all the panels are completely interchangable.

52:16.473 --> 52:20.260
The interior too would be familiar to Lancia fans.

52:22.204 --> 52:26.238
The pedals are nowhere near where the bottom of my legs are.

52:26.512 --> 52:31.036
The steering wheel is perilously close to where my testis used to be,

52:31.036 --> 52:35.389
before the seatbelt jammed them up into my lungs.

52:35.493 --> 52:38.475
The gear lever acts like one of Bugs Bunny's ears,

52:38.476 --> 52:42.157
and one of the switches on the dashboard operates a fire extinguisher,

52:42.157 --> 52:45.702
since I don't know which one it is, I dare not touch any of them.

52:46.568 --> 52:50.575
The wiper has gone upside down,

52:50.575 --> 52:55.244
that wouldn't actually clear the rain from the window.

52:55.245 --> 52:57.744
Then there was a big noise.

53:00.270 --> 53:03.159
Wait a minute, what the hell? What was that?

53:03.160 --> 53:05.497
The front left brake had jammed on.

53:05.941 --> 53:10.471
I got to get this in to a workshop. Come on, come on.

53:11.048 --> 53:14.640
I took the car to Nigel, the resident mechanic at our track,

53:14.640 --> 53:17.570
and greeted him in the usual fashion.

53:17.571 --> 53:19.308
Have you got a hammer?

53:22.212 --> 53:26.780
That is scalding hot, as we can see on the thermal-images camera.

53:30.286 --> 53:33.338
He has just gone to answer the phone now.

53:33.339 --> 53:36.270
While we wait, I suppose I should explain

53:36.271 --> 53:40.251
the 13,000 pounds doesn't include the cost of an engine,

53:40.251 --> 53:41.551
you have to get one yourself.

53:41.551 --> 53:44.834
And you have a choice of two, you can either get Fiat's twin-cam,

53:44.835 --> 53:47.414
that you can buy used these day for about 5p,

53:47.415 --> 53:51.442
or for 600 quid, you can get the engine I have in this.

53:51.685 --> 53:55.644
Use this handle which is disguised as a spoiler to get the back up,

53:55.645 --> 53:59.806
and there you are Alfa's brilliant 3 litre V6.

54:00.467 --> 54:04.841
This actually produces more power than the Ferrari engine Lancia used.

54:05.374 --> 54:09.605
And with it the Hawk is faster, when it is working,

54:09.606 --> 54:13.057
which it will be, eventually.

54:17.237 --> 54:20.409
It is mended. Now I'm going to get back in.

54:20.409 --> 54:24.477
Which is a surprisingly elegant process if you're a mouse.

54:24.478 --> 54:25.960
You simply get one...

54:25.961 --> 54:28.195
No, that's not good.

54:28.195 --> 54:32.112
You sort of get over this roll bar, like this.

54:32.112 --> 54:36.924
Then you get your head in, it's probably easier to detatch your head first,

54:36.924 --> 54:39.600
and put it back on in the car.

54:40.644 --> 54:41.962
There we are. Whenever there, and

54:41.963 --> 54:45.240
Over there!
And then..

54:45.240 --> 54:48.980
You might want to cut the camera for this bit.

54:50.932 --> 54:53.757
I had intended at this point to check out the performance,

54:53.757 --> 54:59.642
but after the brake problem I had rather lost my nerve.

55:03.871 --> 55:07.891
0-60 takes less than five seconds

55:07.891 --> 55:14.399
and what I'm not going to do now is see where that acceleration stops.

55:14.660 --> 55:21.662
I really don't want to travel at 150mph in a car built in a shed by a man I have never met.

55:22.828 --> 55:24.435
This is 90 perhaps,

55:24.711 --> 55:27.278
that's, the wiper has gone.

55:28.569 --> 55:30.492
That is an important consideration,

55:30.492 --> 55:34.594
you have to bear in mind if you are thinking of buying a used kit car.

55:34.594 --> 55:35.750
You have to ask,

55:35.751 --> 55:40.137
was it built fastidiously by James May over a period of

55:40.137 --> 55:45.777
many hundreds of years, or was it built by a spanner, with a hammer?

55:47.845 --> 55:52.337
I mean, would you buy a kit car that I had built?

55:56.193 --> 55:58.612
Having chickened on the max speed run,

55:58.612 --> 56:04.260
I decided not find out what it is like flat out through the corners.

56:04.804 --> 56:07.297
Here we go, I'm going in,

56:07.298 --> 56:10.946
and here I am cornering not at all flat out.

56:12.011 --> 56:14.897
60, that's fine.

56:14.898 --> 56:18.707
Brakes, all three and three quarters of them are very squirrelly.

56:18.992 --> 56:22.007
The steering is very heavy, a lot of body roll.

56:22.453 --> 56:23.453
There we are.

56:24.260 --> 56:26.801
I think that's probably enough cornering now,

56:26.801 --> 56:28.910
we have done that, tick.

56:31.494 --> 56:36.159
Certainly then, the Hawk is only as good as the bloke who put it together.

56:36.159 --> 56:40.387
You will spend more time under it than in it, for example.

56:42.207 --> 56:46.843
I'm not going to pretend it is as good as an original Stratos either,

56:46.844 --> 56:55.213
but the same reason that a postcard of the Mona Lisa is not as good as Leonardo's.

56:55.683 --> 56:58.843
But one day your car will be working

56:58.508 --> 57:03.233
and you will see a reflection of yourself in a shop window as you go by,

57:03.233 --> 57:08.137
and trust me on this, that's gonna feel good.

57:08.137 --> 57:11.613
Because critically this looks like a Stratos.

57:11.614 --> 57:17.218
If we're honest, that's all we really want.

57:33.009 --> 57:36.033
I would like to build a kit car like that,

57:36.034 --> 57:37.984
cos I think it would be very therapeutic.

57:37.985 --> 57:39.054
It would be.

57:39.055 --> 57:42.813
You know what I mean. It is more satisfying to have something you have made yourself?

57:43.605 --> 57:45.848
I don't even like to eat a sandwich I have made myself,

57:45.848 --> 57:49.157
because it always has blood in it and bits of my fingers.

57:49.158 --> 57:50.158
But anyway.

57:50.525 --> 57:54.888
We must now find out how fast this car goes round our track,

57:54.888 --> 57:59.192
and of course that means handing it over to our tame racing driver.

57:59.192 --> 58:03.304
Some say his new Christmas range of fragrances,

58:03.305 --> 58:07.806
includes the great smell of Wednesday,

58:07.806 --> 58:11.475
and that he was turned down for the job of EU President,

58:11.475 --> 58:16.022
because his face is just too recoginsable.

58:16.023 --> 58:19.218
All we know is he's called The Stig.

58:20.152 --> 58:21.981
He's off, there he goes.

58:21.982 --> 58:24.031
I say listen to that noise.

58:24.031 --> 58:30.140
The Alfa V6 sounds, if anything, even better than the Ferrari V6.

58:30.297 --> 58:33.147
That's fantastic sound.

58:33.148 --> 58:35.147
What's happening here?

58:35.678 --> 58:38.052
Is he looking for the stereo, no,

58:38.053 --> 58:41.727
Stiggy what's gone wrong? He's broken down.

58:41.727 --> 58:44.570
How authentic is that?

58:44.571 --> 58:48.243
This is a scene familiar to any Lancia owner,

58:48.243 --> 58:51.582
look at him walking off, completing his journey on foot.

58:51.583 --> 58:54.267
There he is, not across the line.

58:54.268 --> 58:55.485
Now, okay.

58:55.716 --> 58:58.605
There is no way we were going to allow

58:58.606 --> 59:01.247
our first-ever DNF (Did Not Finish)

59:01.247 --> 59:04.032
on the board, to be a Lancia, no way.

59:04.033 --> 59:08.783
So we, mended the car, in a shed, okay,

59:08.783 --> 59:13.849
brought it back, it was here, this morning for The Stig to try again.

59:16.244 --> 59:18.646
Unfortunately it was raining this time.

59:18.646 --> 59:21.945
But the car has set off well, still making a fabulous noise,

59:21.945 --> 59:27.858
look at the rooster tails, stip dipping badly underbraking as the Stig turns in.

59:27.858 --> 59:32.227
Ooh!! I say that's a bit wide. Stiggy where are you going?

59:32.228 --> 59:35.685
He's got it back. Now that's amazing driving.

59:35.686 --> 59:38.917
He comes up to Chicago, locked up the front,

59:38.917 --> 59:43.759
back stepped out, this is wide he's gone. The Stig has spun.

59:43.759 --> 59:48.437
That's not going to stop him, he's still going on, look at that for determination.

59:48.437 --> 59:51.784
Stig obviously a Lancia fan as well as he comes up to the hammerhead,

59:51.784 --> 59:57.407
he has got it to turn in nicely, done better than Chris Evans there.

59:57.407 --> 01:00:01.280
Nice through with the whole beautifully-held slide.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.267
It's gone wrong, he's headed for the camera crew.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.437
I bet they were frightened. Here we go.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:08.178
Is he breaking down again?
No he isn't,

01:00:08.178 --> 01:00:11.777
that is not at all like a Lancia as he comes to the follow-through.

01:00:11.777 --> 01:00:14.996
He's definitely backed off of that, I can't say I blame him,

01:00:14.997 --> 01:00:18.482
as he heads now towards the tyres, building up speed,

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:20.247
not too much speed.

01:00:20.247 --> 01:00:23.613
He's coming down, crikey this is out of control now,

01:00:23.614 --> 01:00:26.110
but he has done it, he's round the second to last corner,

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:28.688
Oh no! He's gone again!

01:00:29.269 --> 01:00:31.340
That's what I call driving,

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.224
as he comes around Gambon, this time across the line.

01:00:36.723 --> 01:00:40.552
That is the best-looking lap we have ever seen.

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.717
I have to say one of the most exciting.

01:00:42.717 --> 01:00:45.743
Spectacular.
- Car control is phenomenal.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:53.219
But the time was, 1.48.2, which means it's also

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:57.924
the slowest slap we have ever had around the Top Gear test track.

01:00:57.925 --> 01:01:00.658
My.. Can you imagine how long it would take if he build it?

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:02.747
My god! It would not finish the lap by now.
Would they?

01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:05.064
No!
- Or now.

01:01:05.065 --> 01:01:08.487
Thank you! Anyway listen, next week we're on for a reason we don't understand,

01:01:08.488 --> 01:01:10.492
at 8.30.
- Or now.

01:01:11.785 --> 01:01:13.581
On that bombshell,
- Or now.

01:01:13.582 --> 01:01:17.809
it's time to end. Thank you so much for watching! Good night!

01:01:23.677 --> 01:01:24.677
Or now.

01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:45.579
Or now.
