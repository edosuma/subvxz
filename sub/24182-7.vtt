WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:14.389
[Alexa] 4:00 p.m. was naptime,
for me and babies and old people.

00:15.682 --> 00:19.019
But there's one thing I had
on the pudding-and-diaper crowd:

00:19.102 --> 00:21.521
when I woke up, Katie would be there.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.399
Usually Katie would be there.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.445
At some point.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.574
-[cries out]
-[thuds]

00:32.657 --> 00:33.950
Ouch!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.035
[grunts]

00:36.369 --> 00:37.370
Alexa?

00:37.454 --> 00:39.414
[yawns] Katie.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.291
[yawns] How long have you been here?

00:42.125 --> 00:44.461
OK, so, how did rehearsals go?
Tell me everything.

00:44.544 --> 00:48.214
Oh, OK. The craziest thing happened.
You know Emma, the girl playing the Nurse?

00:48.298 --> 00:49.340
Yeah.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.926
Well, a bat flew into the auditorium,

00:52.010 --> 00:55.138
smacked her right in the back of the head
and just knocked her off the stage.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.974
Yeah. She sprained her ankle
and had to get a rabies shot.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.434
[laughs]

01:00.935 --> 01:02.187
Oh, we're not laughing at that?

01:03.146 --> 01:06.858
Oh, that reminds me, the funniest thing
happened in sixth period.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.194
OK, so, Jeremy bent over and he fl--

01:09.277 --> 01:11.362
-[cell phone chimes]
-Ooh, it's Kendall.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.447
[laughs]

01:12.739 --> 01:14.240
-Seriously?
-[cell phone chimes]

01:14.324 --> 01:15.533
Oh, sorry.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.910
[laughs]

01:16.993 --> 01:19.537
-Look at this picture Beth just texted.
-Who's Beth?

01:20.246 --> 01:21.539
Is that an armpit?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.541
Oh, that's so Beth.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.668
Oh, sorry. So, what were you saying?

01:25.752 --> 01:28.880
-Oh. So, Jeremy bent over and he--
-[knocking]

01:28.963 --> 01:29.964
Hey, guys.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.759
You're into books, right?

01:32.842 --> 01:33.885
Uh... Y-Yes.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.011
Cool.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.222
I've got to find a classic
and write a report,

01:37.305 --> 01:39.641
but the only book in my room
was Curious George,

01:39.724 --> 01:41.392
which totally holds up, by the way.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.021
-Any ideas?
-Pride and Prejudice?

01:45.104 --> 01:46.898
Not prejudiced, can't relate.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.817
Um... The Grapes of Wrath?

01:48.900 --> 01:49.943
Hmm.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.779
I do love me some high-intensity wrath.

01:52.862 --> 01:53.988
And grapes.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.407
Thanks, Lex.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.660
That will be disappointing for him.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.377
Katie! Wherefore art thou, Katie?

02:49.460 --> 02:51.963
[chuckles] Save it for Verona,
Lord Capulet.

02:52.046 --> 02:52.964

02:53.423 --> 02:54.257
Hey, Alexa.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.550
[Alexa gasps]

02:55.633 --> 02:56.843
Dylan! [laughs]

02:56.926 --> 02:58.344
What's going on?

02:58.428 --> 02:59.762
[indistinct chatter]

03:00.305 --> 03:03.099
Nothing much. Hey, don't forget
that tutor session we have later.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.267
[laughs]

03:04.350 --> 03:08.479
Oh, my God, Dylan! You're so funny!

03:08.563 --> 03:10.356
That... wasn't really a joke.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.941
Oh, stop it!

03:13.484 --> 03:15.820
The Romeo and Juliet meeting
commenceth now.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.072
Commenceth now
the Romeo and Juliet meeting.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.492
-[girl] One of those dresses is for Katie.
-Katie, wait.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.745
Cast... only.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.872
Commenceth elsewhere.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.045
Have not saints lips,

03:32.587 --> 03:33.755
and holy palmers, too?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.590
Ay, pilgrim,

03:35.673 --> 03:37.425
lips that they must use in prayer.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.844
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh, that might be Scott!

03:39.928 --> 03:43.264
My boyfriend.
I haven't heard from him in a while.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.516
His cell phone's been in the shop.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.185
That's a thing.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.437
Keep acting.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.521
Uh...

03:50.605 --> 03:52.023
Saints do not move,

03:52.106 --> 03:53.983
though grant for prayers' sake.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.777
Then move not,

03:55.860 --> 03:57.528
while my prayer's effect I take.

04:00.865 --> 04:01.991
"And kiss."

04:02.075 --> 04:03.409
[Ryan chuckles]

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
Well, it wasn't Scott,

04:05.328 --> 04:07.664
but my much-younger sister's
getting married.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
[laughs]

04:09.916 --> 04:12.377
Great job, everyone... I think.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.837
Uh... Shouldn't we kiss in this scene?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.631
I-I mean, to practice for Friday.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.968
Or... do we even have to kiss at all?

04:20.051 --> 04:23.137
See, I'm not sure
how necessary it is to the story.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.056
It's Romeo and Juliet.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.351
Not all couples kiss these days,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.186
or come to the door to pick you up.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.231
Sometimes it's just
a couple of honks and you're off.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.694
Katie is really good.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.903
Oh, I know, right?

04:38.987 --> 04:41.823
People have been telling me,
but I just assumed they were being nice.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.158
I'm Bennett, Romeo's dad.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.410
Jennifer.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.995
Uh... Ryan's good, too.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.121
Eh.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.833
Ryan's pretty overwhelmed
with two days left.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.210
He asked about Katie coming over
to rehearse tomorrow.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.212
Oh, that's perfect.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.423
Your family should come over to our place.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.174
"Hosting rehearsal,"

05:00.258 --> 05:03.803
that sounds like something
from the volunteer list, doesn't it, huh?

05:04.262 --> 05:06.306
-Great. We'll bring pizza.
-Perfect!

05:06.389 --> 05:08.933
Will you bring one with veggies
so I don't have to make a salad?

05:09.017 --> 05:09.976
[chuckles]

05:10.310 --> 05:11.311
Great.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.655
Ooh! I'm so excited
to finally try this on!

05:22.739 --> 05:26.242
Oh, you're going to be a beautiful Juliet.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.661
Or maybe a headless ghost.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.746
[Lori laughs]

05:30.997 --> 05:34.500
Hey, sweetie! I thought I'd stop by
before class to see you.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.169
[Katie] If only you could.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.545
[Lori laughs]

05:37.795 --> 05:40.048
Yeah, I think you got here
two inches too early.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.758
[laughter]

05:42.633 --> 05:45.011
Neckline humor. That's... funny.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.931
Oh, Katie, in case you get hungry,
I made you a PB and J.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.643
Well, we were almost out of jam,
so it's more like a PB and "juh."

05:52.727 --> 05:53.811
[Jennifer chuckles]

05:54.103 --> 05:56.689
Lori brought me a turkey sub, but thanks!

05:56.773 --> 05:57.774
[grunts] Here.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.734
-Bye!
-Oh, wrong way.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.194
Oh. Bye, Mom.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.448
OK. I'll see you tonight, um...
or two inches later.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.699
[silence]

06:07.366 --> 06:08.743
Or whatever. Just...

06:09.410 --> 06:10.536
-[sighs]
-All right.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.791
Well, I still have a little bit of work on
my end, but then you'll be set to shine.

06:15.875 --> 06:20.505
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, hopefully.
I'm not sure that last scene was working.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.340
The kiss scene?

06:23.591 --> 06:24.425
Yeah.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.762
Is this your first kiss?

06:28.888 --> 06:30.056
Yeah.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.725
[groans] My first kiss
will be in front of an audience.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.894
You know, I-I barely know Ryan.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.771
Well, then don't count it.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.898
I had a first kiss that didn't count.

06:39.398 --> 06:42.902
Yeah. It was tenth grade
and he was a football player.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.278
His name was Zack, uh...

06:45.363 --> 06:47.073
It started with an "M."

06:48.324 --> 06:51.786
Anyways, I was cheering at a game
and I kicked him in the head.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.247
So I tried giving him CPR, um...

06:54.330 --> 06:55.540
but it didn't work.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.999
It was a sloppy mess.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.211
So... So this doesn't have to count?

07:00.294 --> 07:02.338
-Uh-uh.
-Thanks, Lori.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.551
So, was it good CPR at least?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.680
Well, I swallowed his mouth guard,
so I'd have to say no.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.853
OK, so the answer is: A, 21;

07:16.936 --> 07:18.604
B, -6; or...

07:19.439 --> 07:22.150
C, I'm secretly a superhero?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.570
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.865
Hey, pay attention! I'm important.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.994
Katie's posting pictures
of her Juliet dress.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.163
It's like, we get it already.

07:35.246 --> 07:39.125
I know, right? I mean, I look cute in
my Juliet dress, but I don't show it off.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.172
I just never see her.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.924
I'm sure she'll make a great Juliet.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.968
She could work a little on her Katie.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.386
Feeling left out?

07:50.970 --> 07:53.514
-Aren't you supposed to be tutoring me?
-Thank you.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.184
So the answer is: A, 21--

07:56.267 --> 07:58.186
[sighs] I just feel a little left out!

07:58.978 --> 08:00.354
You know, I could play the Nurse!

08:00.438 --> 08:02.690
[chuckles] OK, a girl sprained her ankle.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.692
It's a really funny story.
I'll tell you later.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.736
How about you do two more problems,

08:06.819 --> 08:09.197
then tell me how it's funny
when people hurt themselves?

08:10.364 --> 08:13.618
Hm. You know, clearly your superpower
isn't a sense of humor.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.084
And she was weaned--

08:22.168 --> 08:23.669
I never shall forget it--

08:23.753 --> 08:25.463
of all the days of the year,

08:25.546 --> 08:26.797
upon that day.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.341
Captivating!

08:30.593 --> 08:33.638
-Hey.
-Hey! Hey, thanks for coming by to see me.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.641
-No, I'm auditioning for...
-Sorry, can't talk. Working on my lines.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.934
...the Nurse.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.145
So?

08:41.229 --> 08:43.606
-You were great, but with your health--
-Please.

08:43.898 --> 08:44.857
I can do it.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.359
Well,

08:46.442 --> 08:49.612
my mind wants to say no,
but my heart wants to say...

08:49.695 --> 08:51.864
-[Lori] No!
-...also no.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.408
Mom, seriously?

08:54.492 --> 08:57.495
-You can't overexert yourself. I'm sorry.
-[Ms. Rogers gasps] Wait.

08:57.578 --> 08:58.913
I have the perfect job!

08:58.996 --> 09:00.540
She'll be able to sit the whole time,

09:00.623 --> 09:04.126
and it will be under the tutelage of one
of the most dynamic members of our team.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.048
Don't touch anything.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.510
Watch and learn, and maybe someday
you'll find a way to tame this...

09:13.177 --> 09:14.929
beautiful beast.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.308
Though I doubt it. This place is doomed
when the Garth-man graduates.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.440
I heard the vacuum. Is Grandma coming?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.653
Katie's friend and his parents
are coming over for dinner,

09:30.736 --> 09:32.446
so you've got to put on some pants, Jack.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.074
You can't just spring pants on someone.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.745
-They're coming soon and bringing pizza.
-Pizza! I can pants for pizza.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.038
[doorbell rings]

09:41.122 --> 09:43.874
Katie, get down here!
I'm being a theater mom!

09:45.084 --> 09:45.918
Hi.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.296
[chuckles] Welcome.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.381
-Thanks for having us.
-Hey, Ms. Cooper.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.884
Just... Just you two?
Where's uh... Romeo's mom?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.595
-[chuckles]
-We're separated.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.179
Oh. Oh.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.474
Well, more pizza and wine for us.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.601
[laughter]

10:01.684 --> 10:03.769
But we went crazy
and brought Indian food instead.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.271
[yells] What?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.276
I put on pants!

10:12.236 --> 10:13.070
OK.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.823
And what is that accent she's doing
for Lady Montague?

10:15.906 --> 10:16.991
I have no idea.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.703
[impersonates] It's like British
with a hint of Muppet, you know?

10:20.786 --> 10:24.081
Oh, this is fun! Theater war stories.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.167
[British accent]
You know, I played Eliza Doo--

10:26.250 --> 10:27.251
Mom!

10:28.919 --> 10:31.756
I just think when someone says
they're gonna bring pizza--

10:31.839 --> 10:33.090
Jack.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.969
-You and your pants are excused.
-Fine!

10:42.058 --> 10:43.059
[Bennett] Oh.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.817
Um... Well...

10:51.901 --> 10:53.819
Well, we have to rehearse.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.946
Oh, great! We can all take a part.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.408
Or we can go sit on the deck.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.744
Perfect. I'm tired of being Juliet.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.621
Although I do have the legs for it.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.707
[Ryan chuckles]

11:06.791 --> 11:09.960
-So um... where do you want to start?
-[clears throat] Um...

11:10.378 --> 11:12.838
-You know what we haven't practiced?
-Death scene.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.256
-The kiss.
-The kiss!

11:14.715 --> 11:15.800
Sure. Yeah, why not?

11:15.883 --> 11:19.470
I should probably apologize
in advance if it isn't... good.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.180
I haven't, uh...

11:21.263 --> 11:24.266
Oh, i-is this your first kiss?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.351
[Ryan scoffs]

11:25.434 --> 11:27.019
What? Come on!

11:27.686 --> 11:28.521
Yes.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.525
[chuckles] So... maybe...

11:32.608 --> 11:34.985
[clears throat]
...maybe, for the sake of the show...

11:35.069 --> 11:37.154
Yeah, yeah. Oh, for the sake of the show.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.906
For the show's sake. For the...

11:38.989 --> 11:40.408
Let's just do it, yeah?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.493
-OK.
-Um... Hmm.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.578
[door opens]

11:44.662 --> 11:45.955
[gasps] Lucas!

11:46.622 --> 11:47.623
[Lucas] Hey, Katie.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.334
Turns out Grapes of Wrath is a downer.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.629
You got any other ideas?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.881
Um... I'll go look. Yeah.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.634
Hey, man.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.718
Nice!

12:05.683 --> 12:07.184
Ryan seems like a sweet kid.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.728
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a little awkward.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.813
Awkward?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.731
Because it's your first kiss?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.400
-Mom.
-Are you a little nervous?

12:14.483 --> 12:15.943
Mom!

12:16.026 --> 12:18.737
Oh, honey. First kisses are a big deal.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.823
You know, my first kiss--

12:20.906 --> 12:23.826
I'm fine, Mom, OK?
Lori already talked to me about it.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.580
You talked to Lori about your first kiss?

12:27.663 --> 12:29.290
Yes. Yes, so I'm good.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.374
[Katie giggles]

12:31.542 --> 12:32.918
[knocking, door opens]

12:33.002 --> 12:35.254
Hey, neighbor.
Hey, listen, I broke my scissors--

12:35.337 --> 12:36.755
You stole my moment!

12:37.673 --> 12:39.717
You're a... moment stealer!

12:41.051 --> 12:43.637
-What?
-You know darn well what.

12:44.138 --> 12:47.475
Ever since you started doing the costumes,
you and Katie have been all,

12:47.558 --> 12:50.394
"two inches too late," and "turkey subs,"

12:50.478 --> 12:52.146
and "Jennifer's a jerk."

12:54.398 --> 12:58.110
-What are you talking about?
-Overreacting? I am not overreacting!

12:59.820 --> 13:02.114
OK, it's late and...

13:02.198 --> 13:04.366
your teeth are stained red,
so I'm gonna go.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.703
But I still need your scissors.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.872
-Well, I will go get them.
-Thank you.

13:09.955 --> 13:10.956
I heard that!

13:14.210 --> 13:16.378
Buddha, Buddha.
Gouda, Gouda, Buddha, Buddha.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.839
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.302
-Hey. I just wanted to--
-Huh? What?

13:23.594 --> 13:27.181
-I just wanted to tell you to break a leg.
-I'm sorry. Can we talk after the show?

13:27.848 --> 13:30.059
You want me to tell you to break a leg
after the show?

13:30.684 --> 13:32.186
[Katie groans]

13:32.269 --> 13:35.231
-Can you find a place to put these?
-Where do you want me--

13:35.314 --> 13:36.982
Oh, Agnes, where's my gold snood?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.653
[sighs]

13:44.615 --> 13:45.908
Is this going to be fun?

13:45.991 --> 13:48.285
It's kids doing Shakespeare,
don't get your hopes up.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.792
-Oh, Lori dropped something.
-Oh, Lori doesn't need our help.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.085
She can do it all.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.213
Mom, why is your eye twitching?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.557
-Are you OK? You look flushed.
-I'm fine.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.226
-Did she look flushed?
-Please don't pierce my Adam's apple.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.477
It's my moneymaker.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.691
Oh, thank you. Um...
Will you put it there?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.154
OK, then. I'll, uh...

14:24.572 --> 14:25.614
Jennifer, wait.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.118
Listen,

14:29.660 --> 14:31.662
I'm sorry if I stole your moment.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.455
It's just,

14:33.831 --> 14:35.040
with Alexa...

14:35.708 --> 14:37.334
we're always talking about her health.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.255
I don't get those fun talks,
like first kisses.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.423
Ow!

14:43.132 --> 14:44.925
-I'm sorry.
-That's OK.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.343
No one's talking to you.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.805
I'm just afraid
that I'm no longer around enough

14:49.889 --> 14:52.433
to have any impact
on my own daughter's life.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.435
Oh, honey, that's not true.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.228
Come here.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.982
This was beautiful.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.652
And a little painful.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.699
All right, thespians,
let's get ready to blow some minds.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.577
You're a high school lighting guy.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.661
That's right.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.955
God said, "Let there be light..."

15:15.539 --> 15:17.082
and there was Garth.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.586
[Katie] For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.881
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.549
O, then, dear saint,

15:25.633 --> 15:28.177
let lips do what hands do.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.720
They pray;

15:29.803 --> 15:32.348
grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.185
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.270
Then move not,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.648
while my prayer's effect I take.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.822
Ew!

15:50.699 --> 15:51.784
Whoa.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.661
Straw me.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.629
[slurping]

16:04.505 --> 16:05.506
[exhales]

16:05.589 --> 16:07.591
[flute playing]

16:12.262 --> 16:13.681
So, how do you like it so far?

16:14.098 --> 16:17.184
-There's more?
-Here, read the program.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.691
Look at all these parents who volunteered.
Did you know you're allowed to help, Mom?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.067
[sighs] Yeah.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.361
Hey, here's Katie.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.029
Oh, look, she thanked Lori.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.781
-Mm.
-And Garth.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.074
The lighting guy?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.536
Eighteen hours of labor
and she thanks the lighting guy.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.205
"And... Mom." That's you.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.748
What? What does it say?

16:39.832 --> 16:40.833
Eh, too long.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.588
"And, Mom,
watching you work so hard for our family

16:46.672 --> 16:49.717
is what's inspired me
to work so hard for this show.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.760
I wouldn't be who I am without you."

16:51.844 --> 16:53.137
[laughs and sniffs]

16:54.805 --> 16:56.306
That's right, I-I made an impact!

16:56.390 --> 16:57.391
[chuckles]

16:58.100 --> 17:00.310
Uh... Read the bio. I-I'm "Mom."

17:00.394 --> 17:01.603
[Jennifer laughs]

17:03.814 --> 17:05.274
Why is it so hot in here?

17:05.357 --> 17:07.359
[sighs] I'm sweating like crazy.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.153
[groans] Now I have to pee. Thanks!

17:09.737 --> 17:11.155
How is that my fault?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.115
You let me drink too much soda.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.700
Total rookie mistake.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.870
You can make up for it
by getting us snacks from backstage.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.788
Got to keep fueling the Garth-mobile.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.919
Eat up, Garth-mobile.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.630
Thirty seconds! Thirty seconds!

17:28.714 --> 17:30.799
Oh, Alexa! I'm so glad to see you.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.342
Me, too. You're doing great.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.137
-Some of the lighting cues have been off.
-What?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.098
Yeah, when they're off even a little bit,
it ruins my focus.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.808
I am barely hanging on out there.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.061
Places, everyone! Places!

17:42.144 --> 17:43.312
It's not my fault. Garth--

17:43.395 --> 17:45.689
I don't care whose fault it is,
just make it happen.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.488
Oh, I'll make something happen.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.326
[door handle rattles]

17:57.409 --> 17:59.036
[Garth] Hey. Hey!

17:59.787 --> 18:01.580
What are you doing in there? Let me in!

18:01.663 --> 18:03.373
-[banging on door]
-Let me in!

18:07.211 --> 18:08.045
Uh...

18:08.128 --> 18:10.464
Nurse, will you go with me into...

18:10.547 --> 18:11.757
Uh...

18:11.840 --> 18:13.592
...into my closet to help...

18:14.468 --> 18:16.970
me sort such needful ornaments...

18:17.054 --> 18:19.306
ornaments... ornaments...

18:19.389 --> 18:22.851
as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.689
No, not till Thursday.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.399
There is time enough.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.484
[banging on door]

18:30.567 --> 18:32.027
[Garth] I'm begging you!

18:32.111 --> 18:34.947
There might be college theater scouts
in the audience!

18:35.364 --> 18:37.616
[Katie] Come on, Alexa! Open the door!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.868
-[Katie groans]
-[Garth] Come on.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.871
Yes!

18:42.955 --> 18:44.123
[Garth sighs]

18:44.206 --> 18:47.084
I'm so sorry, Jezebel.
I should have never abandoned you.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.377
What are you doing?

18:48.460 --> 18:50.212
Sorry, tech crew only.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.172
Aren't you supposed to be on stage?

18:53.048 --> 18:56.093
If only thy Juliet were thee around...

18:56.343 --> 18:58.846
Ay, that would be goodeth.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.899
Oh, my gosh!

19:12.359 --> 19:14.278
[Garth groans]

19:15.279 --> 19:17.197
[sighs] You feel good about yourself?

19:19.491 --> 19:20.826
I licked those.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.086
For never was a story of more woe

19:31.170 --> 19:34.631
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.550
[Renaissance music playing]

19:37.176 --> 19:38.802
[cheering and whistling]

19:39.887 --> 19:41.096
They die?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.516
You didn't tell me they die!

19:48.228 --> 19:49.313
You were amazing!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.190
Ah.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.859
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you!

19:53.942 --> 19:55.694
Oh, thanks, Mom!

19:56.570 --> 19:59.072
Katie, nice job out there.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.866
Oh, hi! Thanks!

20:00.949 --> 20:02.284
I-I can't believe you came.

20:02.701 --> 20:06.371
Well, when I saw the posters of you
up in school, I suddenly realized,

20:06.455 --> 20:09.708
why read a whole book when I could just
watch the play and do my report on that?

20:09.791 --> 20:10.792
[Katie laughs]

20:10.876 --> 20:12.669
Yeah, cool. Cool, cool.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.217
-Good show, Katie.
-Uh... Yeah. Yeah, you, too.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.134
Katie.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.094
[Katie sighs]

20:21.178 --> 20:22.679
You were amazing out there.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.307
And I was definitely rooting against you.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.893
Oh. Uh... Thanks, Vanessa.

20:28.393 --> 20:32.481
-How did you memorize all those lines?
-Well, I mean, it took a ton of hard work.

20:32.564 --> 20:36.360
-But Alexa helped me almost every night.
-Oh, right. You're friends with her?

20:36.818 --> 20:38.862
Yeah, she's my best friend.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.864
Really? I never see you guys together.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.544
I'm the worst.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.756
Go on.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.842
I'm sorry, OK?

21:00.926 --> 21:03.303
I was so in my head wanting to be good,

21:03.387 --> 21:06.223
I-I didn't even realize
how rude I was being.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.183
OK, if it weren't for you,

21:08.267 --> 21:11.103
I never would have gone out for this play
in the first place.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.606
I'm glad you did. And you were great.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.817
I'm sorry, too.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.570
I was just feeling really left out
and I snapped.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.324
And you know the worst part
about not talking to you?

21:25.242 --> 21:27.577
I had no one to complain about you to.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.704
[Alexa chuckles]

21:28.787 --> 21:31.456
And, boy, did I have some stuff to say.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.541
[Katie laughs]

21:36.044 --> 21:37.587
Oh, you're... you're burning up.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.256
Uh... Lori?

21:41.049 --> 21:42.092
Honey?

21:43.051 --> 21:46.263
Yeah, you have a fever.
OK, it's no big deal. You know the drill.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.515
You have a fever,
you gotta be monitored at hospital.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.434
-OK.
-[Nathan] Hey, Katie.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.060
After-party at my house.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.604
I'm so proud of you.
Have a great time tonight.
