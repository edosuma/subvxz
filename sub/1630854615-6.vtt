00:07.048 --> 00:10.051
<i>Round 13.</i>
<i>Three minutes remaining.</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:25.608
I don't want you.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.350
Damn it!

01:44.854 --> 01:48.191
<i>There are two players</i>
<i>remaining until checkmate.</i>

01:51.236 --> 01:52.987
Miss?

02:01.871 --> 02:04.124
Nobody cared
about saving that kid.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.919
When given the option,
they sided with the Queen.

02:11.172 --> 02:14.717
They'll do whatever it takes not to die.
It's a fact.

02:15.927 --> 02:19.222
Nobody wants to see a child be killed.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.684
But in the end,
everyone wants to save their own skin.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.145
Each and every human being is that way.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.940
Then I guess…

02:31.401 --> 02:33.278
you've never met somebody

02:34.863 --> 02:36.614
that you really cared about.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.417
Fucking hypocrites like you
make me wanna throw up.

02:51.629 --> 02:55.049
If you really cared
about this kid so much,

02:56.050 --> 02:57.677
you'd die with him.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.390
But something tells me
you'll change your mind soon.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.642
You will.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.365
Are you okay?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.119
I promise

03:24.913 --> 03:27.081
I won't stop protecting you.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.713
<i>Round 14.</i>
<i>Challenger Team's turn beginning.</i>

03:34.297 --> 03:37.050
<i>This turn will last five minutes.</i>

03:38.009 --> 03:40.511
<i>Turn, start.</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:55.628
Usagi!

04:55.712 --> 04:57.088
Stay where you are!

05:04.554 --> 05:06.973
-You okay?
-I have an idea.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.141
Follow me.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.857
Ow!

05:31.164 --> 05:32.915
You all right?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.334
Did you see them?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.211
Okay, there isn't much time
left on the clock, so we have to--

05:37.295 --> 05:38.421
Run!

05:48.181 --> 05:50.266
Usagi. We need to capture five more.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.185
I saw people upstairs. Let's go!

05:52.268 --> 05:53.144
Wait!

05:53.644 --> 05:55.480
Let's go! Come on, Usagi.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.522
Wait.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.990
You guys…

06:07.075 --> 06:09.744
Do you really wanna
keep working for the Queen?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.789
Yeah, of course we do.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.916
We don't wanna die.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.127
If we keep playing for the Queen's side
and we win,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.754
then we can stay right here.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.257
If we're in this arena,
we don't need to play anything else.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.802
No getting hunted down or shot.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.764
You've gotta be kidding me.
Winning isn't the most important thing!

06:29.847 --> 06:31.849
Right now? Yeah. Yeah, it is.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.937
No. You're wrong about that.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.649
Listen.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.946
The most important thing
isn't just winning the game!

06:47.990 --> 06:49.867
It's getting back to our world.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.457
If all you really care about is winning,

06:57.333 --> 06:59.419
then sure, you're doing everything right.

06:59.502 --> 07:03.673
You're protected by the Queen,
and you can live in this world forever.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.844
But is that what you want?

07:09.512 --> 07:12.140
If our side wins, we can beat the Queen.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.767
If we beat every single face card game,

07:15.768 --> 07:17.311
then there's a chance…

07:17.395 --> 07:19.522
a chance we can get back home again.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.279
There's no going back there.
Ever.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.115
That world's all over.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.034
It's just over.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.663
These games have rules,
just like the rest.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.876
The face card guys,
if they lose, they get killed.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.044
Just like us.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.671
Which means if we beat them,

07:44.380 --> 07:46.048
then there won't be anyone else.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.469
This will all end
if we win every face card game.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.763
That's just a guess, man,
and nothing more.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.932
Yeah, a guess.

07:55.892 --> 07:56.767
And hope.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.605
Maybe hope is what we need to survive.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.440
I won't give up.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.819
Sure, you can extend
your lives here with the Queen.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.905
But what does that mean?

08:10.198 --> 08:13.868
Y-- you're spending the rest of your lives
killing each other.

08:17.705 --> 08:18.748
That's not a life.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.836
Why don't you take a chance with us?

08:29.675 --> 08:32.553
This place
isn't that different from our world.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.892
You guys want to go back
to our world so badly?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.103
That place sucked.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.190
Maybe…

08:46.484 --> 08:48.194
Maybe this one'll be better.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.581
Yeah.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.168
I thought the same until recently.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.548
Going back might not be all that great.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.011
But you know…

09:16.514 --> 09:18.599
I want to go back, I really do.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.648
I wanna make it back to our world.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.029
For all the pain and heartache
I lived with,

09:34.490 --> 09:36.158
I was born and raised there.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.413
And it made me who I am today.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.541
I miss that world.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.631
At times, it was unbearably lonely.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.263
But I believe it taught me kindness.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.016
That life that I had…

10:01.559 --> 10:04.020
I'm kind here because it made me that way.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.027
This world makes kindness easy to forget.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.578
I want to return.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.333
I want to give that life another shot.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.475
I…

10:44.143 --> 10:45.353
I wanna go back.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.358
I do.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.904
I want to return and see

10:56.280 --> 10:57.365
my family.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.759
Do you think…

11:19.220 --> 11:20.429
Could I start over?

11:24.892 --> 11:27.645
<i>Two turns remaining.</i>

11:27.728 --> 11:31.482
<i>Round 15 is the final one</i>
<i>for the Queen Team.</i>

11:31.565 --> 11:34.235
<i>This turn will last five minutes.</i>

11:34.819 --> 11:36.529
<i>Turn, start.</i>

12:02.471 --> 12:04.849
They have 14 on their side?

12:04.932 --> 12:07.476
We need to get back five people
for a majority.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.311
How do we do that in just one turn?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.605
The other side can win just by running.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.775
Okay, then.
We chase and catch them one by one.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.569
Wait.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.993
There's one more option.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.085
I want that guy on our side
before the game's over.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.588
And the woman?

12:38.674 --> 12:39.842
I don't want her.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.638
Let's teach her that fake virtues
have no place in this world.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.058
-Aah!
-Let's go!

12:53.647 --> 12:54.857
Come here!

12:58.235 --> 12:59.445
Stop running!

13:01.947 --> 13:03.908
Okay. Run!

13:15.377 --> 13:16.295
Down there!

13:17.296 --> 13:18.589
Stop running!

13:27.765 --> 13:29.892
We don't need you. Move!

13:34.188 --> 13:35.272
After her!

13:40.778 --> 13:42.363
-This way!
-All right!

13:53.123 --> 13:54.250
You, upstairs!

13:54.750 --> 13:55.584
Run.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.340
Over there!

14:03.592 --> 14:05.427
Found him!

14:06.095 --> 14:07.513
Woo-hoo!

14:07.596 --> 14:08.597
Faster!

14:21.277 --> 14:24.446
<i>Round 15 is ending shortly.</i>

14:24.530 --> 14:26.824
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

14:46.010 --> 14:47.386
Grab him!

14:54.476 --> 14:56.812
<i>Final turn, start.</i>

14:57.730 --> 14:58.606
Go!

15:05.279 --> 15:07.448
Arisu!

15:11.118 --> 15:12.578
They went that way!

15:18.042 --> 15:20.002
Get him!

15:20.085 --> 15:21.420
-Oh! Oh!
-We did it! Yeah!

15:21.503 --> 15:23.547
-I can't believe it!
-Fuck, yeah!

15:45.569 --> 15:47.071
-Yeah!
-Yes!

15:47.154 --> 15:48.322
We won!

15:49.114 --> 15:50.783
-This is incredible!
-We won!

15:53.535 --> 15:55.162
Yeah, we did so great!

15:55.829 --> 15:57.456
We pulled through!

15:57.539 --> 15:58.624
-Yes!
-We showed them!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.376
-We did it. We won.
-Yes!

16:01.293 --> 16:03.128
-Oh yes!
-That was so bad!

16:03.212 --> 16:06.298
-We pulled through. You pulled through!
-No, you were great!

16:06.840 --> 16:09.635
-Great! Well done! Well done!
-Yes!

16:19.311 --> 16:22.147
I don't know
how you convinced everyone.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.942
But congratulations,

16:25.025 --> 16:26.902
Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.197
When I go back,

16:31.699 --> 16:33.409
I'm not going to be alone.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.703
I'm leaving with my friends.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.163
They matter.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.667
That's what you think?

16:43.919 --> 16:46.296
You have way more freedom here, you know.

16:47.673 --> 16:51.427
This place is much more my scene
than that rigid world.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.138
You were players, weren't you?

16:55.222 --> 16:57.850
You were brought here to play,
just like us.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.601
You had to play the games.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.854
Well, am I wrong?

17:05.357 --> 17:07.860
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.529
-Once the games are done.
-Not before then?

17:12.072 --> 17:14.074
What'll we learn when they're all over?

17:16.076 --> 17:18.537
First you clear all the face cards.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.165
Then you'll know everything.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.834
Will we learn where we are?

17:23.917 --> 17:26.003
Can we go back to our world?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.550
You'll have to wait and find out, baby.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.970
-<i>Time is up.</i>
-Hey!

17:35.471 --> 17:39.266
<i>It is game over for everyone</i>
<i>on the Queen's Team.</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:43.604
I wanna live free until my last breath.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.483
See you later.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.284
I want to finish these games.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.870
I want the answer.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.208
But more than that…

18:48.252 --> 18:50.170
I wanna go back to our world.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.383
Both of us together.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.723
So do I.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.404
Hey, look.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.832
That smell…

19:29.126 --> 19:30.002
Did you fart?

19:30.794 --> 19:31.962
Of course not!

20:16.131 --> 20:17.216
Hot!

20:20.969 --> 20:21.970
Wow!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.181
It's a hot spring!

20:24.264 --> 20:25.682
There's a hot spring!

20:26.642 --> 20:28.727
Usagi! Look!

20:28.810 --> 20:31.021
-It's really a hot spring!
-Oh…

20:31.897 --> 20:33.815
The water's perfect over here!

20:33.899 --> 20:36.109
Really? Then let's get in!

20:36.944 --> 20:39.947
When's the last time we took a bath?
We can't pass this up!

20:40.530 --> 20:42.366
-Huh? Together?
-Huh…

20:43.450 --> 20:45.327
Huh? Oh…

21:05.472 --> 21:08.016
I could die right now and I'd be happy.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.730
I just wish that…

21:15.232 --> 21:17.734
the painful memories washed away
as easily as dirt.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.905
Yeah, I know.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.578
What's wrong?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.289
Usagi?

21:32.582 --> 21:33.625
Usagi?

21:35.794 --> 21:36.753
Hey!

21:37.671 --> 21:38.922
Usagi?

21:43.051 --> 21:44.386
That's not possible.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.181
They can't be real, can they?

22:07.743 --> 22:09.286
They're taking a bath too.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.082
Maybe they escaped from a zoo
or something.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.046
If we hadn't been brought here,

22:20.380 --> 22:21.882
we'd have never seen this.

22:23.759 --> 22:24.634
Yeah.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.723
You know what's kind of crazy?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.684
I'm feeling emotional.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.812
And I'm not entirely sure why.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.943
Right there with you.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.671
I'm sorry. I didn't see anything!

23:01.755 --> 23:05.133
Just elephants! I'm only looking at them.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.302
I love elephants.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.595
It's okay.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.140
You can stay.

26:02.686 --> 26:03.728
Found it.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.793
KIMIKO KUINA
ADMITTED: JUNE 2, 2021

26:50.400 --> 26:52.027
Mom, I wanna see you again.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.975
This makes me sick.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.146
All the work of some twisted fuck.

28:13.316 --> 28:16.027
Stuff like this
makes me lose hope for humanity.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.322
This person knew
they were gonna die.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.450
But they fought until the very end.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.163
They didn't give up hope.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.147
There's still hope here.

29:23.845 --> 29:28.057
SUPREME COURT

29:43.990 --> 29:45.200
Fascinating.

29:46.576 --> 29:49.120
So you were the King of Diamonds
all along.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.706
The Beach executive.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.875
Former Number Two.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.335
Kuzuryu.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.924
Why was the King of Diamonds at the Beach?

30:03.468 --> 30:04.886
I was curious.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.138
Undercover, then.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.143
<i>Difficulty, King of Diamonds.</i>

30:12.227 --> 30:15.230
<i>Game, Beauty Contest.</i>

30:17.816 --> 30:19.067
Let us begin.

30:34.666 --> 30:38.002
<i>Rules.</i>
<i>Contestants have three minutes</i>

30:38.086 --> 30:41.464
<i>to choose a number between zero and 100.</i>

30:42.215 --> 30:47.512
<i>The average of the numbers</i>
<i>everyone selected is multiplied by 0.8.</i>

30:47.595 --> 30:52.225
<i>The person who chose the number</i>
<i>closest to that result is the winner.</i>

30:53.434 --> 30:58.690
Multiply the average value
of what we all chose by 0.8.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.820
Whoever's number
is closest to that result wins.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.321
Hmm?

31:05.405 --> 31:09.075
Multiply the average value by 0.8?

31:10.326 --> 31:13.288
Why 0.8? What's 0.8 mean?

31:14.455 --> 31:15.540
I get it.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.294
Multiplying the average
by the fixed value of 0.8

31:19.377 --> 31:21.045
disrupts the scale's balance.

31:22.463 --> 31:23.673
That's why it's a game.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.259
0.8 is a drop.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.262
A single drop straight from heaven.

31:30.889 --> 31:34.142
<i>One point will be deducted</i>
<i>from the four losers,</i>

31:34.225 --> 31:36.644
<i>and the round is concluded.</i>

31:36.728 --> 31:42.317
<i>When a player reaches negative ten points,</i>
<i>they will receive a game over.</i>

31:42.400 --> 31:45.945
<i>The last player standing</i>
<i>will clear the game.</i>

31:46.029 --> 31:51.367
<i>However, every time a player</i>
<i>is eliminated, a new rule is added.</i>

31:51.451 --> 31:54.329
A new rule? What's with that?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.834
And nobody's explaining these scales.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.922
<i>Round one, start.</i>

32:17.894 --> 32:19.312
Hmm…

32:43.211 --> 32:45.922
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

32:47.966 --> 32:51.260
<i>The average of the numbers</i>
<i>chosen in the first round</i>

32:51.970 --> 32:54.180
<i>is 32.8.</i>

32:54.806 --> 32:58.434
<i>After multiplying this value by 0.8,</i>

33:00.269 --> 33:02.480
<i>the player closest to this number</i>

33:02.563 --> 33:04.357
<i>is Master Kuzuryu,</i>

33:05.024 --> 33:06.067
<i>the winner.</i>

33:12.490 --> 33:14.784
If everyone picked 40<i>,</i>

33:16.119 --> 33:17.996
then the average value

33:18.079 --> 33:20.039
would be 40, of course.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.792
Multiplying that by 0.8 is 32.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.586
Even if everyone anticipated that
and chose 32,

33:25.670 --> 33:29.173
multiplying the average value by 0.8
will yield a lower number.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.009
So that won't work.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.678
If everyone picks the same, that means

33:34.804 --> 33:37.348
getting stuck in a cycle and no one wins.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.435
So we can't do that. Nah.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.478
Ah, I understand.

33:42.562 --> 33:46.733
You just need to predict your opponents'
moves and be a few steps ahead.

33:46.816 --> 33:50.153
Mmm… This feels like a heart
more than a diamond.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.739
Hmm! We're reading each other.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.241
Whether you play poker or chess,

33:55.324 --> 33:58.661
in an intellectual game,
you have to read your opponent.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.456
Not reading their minds,

34:02.165 --> 34:03.958
but predicting their reasoning.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.085
Wouldn't you say?

34:08.379 --> 34:09.797
Huh, King?

34:11.424 --> 34:12.592
Their reasoning?

34:19.557 --> 34:20.933
You ignoring me?

34:23.603 --> 34:24.604
What's that?

34:25.354 --> 34:26.397
Water?

34:29.275 --> 34:31.360
That is sulfuric acid.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.572
-What?
-Oh, so you'll answer him…

34:35.907 --> 34:38.910
If someone reaches
negative ten points, the scales will tip.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.080
It'll melt our bodies.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.875
Best case, we end up horribly disfigured.

34:52.131 --> 34:53.424
Scales, well…

34:54.926 --> 34:56.469
Let me guess.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.513
The King of Diamonds is a lawyer.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.389
At least, he used to be.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.060
Yes, but that's in the past.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.853
That bad, was it?

35:06.896 --> 35:09.982
But even so, you selected this venue.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.821
Interesting game arena, the Supreme Court.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.282
This giant installation.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.786
The badge a lawyer wears
represents equality and fairness.

35:21.869 --> 35:25.623
All life, including yours,
is equally valuable.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.501
Is that what you wanna say?

35:28.584 --> 35:30.378
What you want us to understand?

35:32.713 --> 35:36.884
The scale will always tip
to whatever side has more gold.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.388
Not all life has the same value, you know.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.436
<i>Round two, start.</i>

35:48.146 --> 35:50.606
<i>Since 26 was the answer before,</i>

35:50.690 --> 35:53.401
<i>maybe I'll multiply that by 0.8 this time?</i>

35:54.026 --> 35:56.946
<i>No, everyone might be</i>
<i>thinking the same thing.</i>

35:57.029 --> 35:59.699
<i>Ah, maybe I'll multiply it by another 0.8?</i>

36:00.658 --> 36:02.827
<i>Suppose everyone chooses 100.</i>

36:02.910 --> 36:05.830
<i>The product after multiplying it by 0.8</i>
<i>would be 80.</i>

36:05.913 --> 36:09.417
<i>In order to win, picking a number</i>
<i>higher than 80 is pointless.</i>

36:09.500 --> 36:13.921
<i>If 80 is the highest average we can have,</i>
<i>multiplying it by 0.8 is 64.</i>

36:14.630 --> 36:19.010
<i>If the highest average is 64,</i>
<i>then multiplying that by 0.8 is 51.2.</i>

36:19.093 --> 36:20.219
<i>So 51.</i>

36:20.928 --> 36:23.890
<i>And we can go on and on,</i>
<i>getting closer and closer to zero.</i>

36:24.390 --> 36:26.392
<i>The law of the stock market is to invest</i>

36:26.475 --> 36:28.686
<i>in stocks that</i>
<i>everyone wants to invest in.</i>

36:29.478 --> 36:32.023
<i>You have to predict everyone's desires.</i>

36:32.106 --> 36:34.734
<i>The crux of this game</i>
<i>is to read a few steps ahead</i>

36:34.817 --> 36:36.694
<i>of everyone else's deductions.</i>

36:37.320 --> 36:41.866
<i>There are already equations that exist</i>
<i>to help read an opponent's rationality.</i>

36:41.949 --> 36:44.368
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

36:44.911 --> 36:48.664
<i>The average of the numbers</i>
<i>chosen in the second round</i>

36:48.748 --> 36:51.209
<i>is 16.6.</i>

36:51.292 --> 36:54.921
<i>After multiplying this value by 0.8,</i>

36:56.088 --> 36:58.466
<i>the player closest to this number</i>

36:59.342 --> 37:02.511
<i>is Master Kuzuryu, the winner.</i>

37:16.525 --> 37:18.653
You were even closer this time.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.490
<i>The number is getting smaller.</i>

37:22.573 --> 37:24.659
<i>So, what, we're supposed to pick zero?</i>

37:26.827 --> 37:29.247
<i>The rational conclusion</i>
<i>would be zero.</i>

37:29.747 --> 37:32.416
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>everyone will pick zero in the end.</i>

37:34.710 --> 37:37.588
<i>Picking zero</i>
<i>is the most rational choice.</i>

37:37.672 --> 37:41.550
<i>But the rational limit</i>
<i>is different for everyone</i>.

37:45.012 --> 37:46.138
Kuzuryu.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.641
What?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.394
I think I understand now.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.522
The thing that you're trying to measure…

37:56.816 --> 37:58.484
it's the value of life, isn't it?

38:02.238 --> 38:03.281
No, it's not.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.574
Then what are you doing?

38:06.784 --> 38:07.910
You can tell me.

38:20.339 --> 38:23.259
Perhaps we could propose
a new settlement figure?

38:23.759 --> 38:27.972
The contaminants that the factory dumped
actually did cause environmental issues.

38:28.055 --> 38:31.183
Twenty people in the surrounding community
died as a result.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.519
Diseases can be caused
by many factors.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.939
What proof is there
that our company is responsible?

38:39.859 --> 38:42.361
I heard that you were
an extremely talented lawyer,

38:42.445 --> 38:44.989
but it seems
you do not understand the law.

38:45.614 --> 38:49.201
Laws don't exist
to protect the weak from the powerful.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.038
Everyone is equal
in the eyes of the law, sir.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.289
That is naive.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.878
In order to save starving people,

38:58.961 --> 39:02.423
you first need the power
to influence the world's economy.

39:03.049 --> 39:07.053
Your principles are not enough to change
a world so full of contradictions.

39:07.803 --> 39:08.804
Let me ask you.

39:11.182 --> 39:15.978
What do you think we should do
to maintain a respectable, modern society?

39:19.106 --> 39:20.649
We need a justice system.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.694
A fair justice system
must exist at all levels.

39:24.862 --> 39:25.905
You mentioned…

39:26.405 --> 39:29.909
You mentioned the importance
of respecting the world's economy.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.454
But prioritizing economic growth
will create more inequality.

39:33.537 --> 39:34.747
-A wealth gap--
-No!

39:35.581 --> 39:39.377
Your duty as a lawyer
isn't to make sound arguments.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.754
Any fool is able to preach equality.

39:42.421 --> 39:46.926
Fairness and justice have no place
in a world more full of monsters than men.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.430
However, thanks to the power
of human imagination,

39:51.514 --> 39:54.308
we can make an unfair argument
sound fair and just.

39:55.017 --> 39:56.977
And you will do just that.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.814
It is your solemn duty
that is given to you by God.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.826
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

40:11.909 --> 40:14.412
<i>The results of the third round.</i>

40:17.540 --> 40:18.749
100?

40:18.833 --> 40:21.836
<i>The average of the numbers is 20.2.</i>

40:21.919 --> 40:24.880
<i>After multiplying this value by 0.8,</i>

40:24.964 --> 40:28.634
<i>the player closest to this number</i>
<i>is Master Daimon, the winner.</i>

40:28.717 --> 40:30.386
Huh? I won?

40:30.469 --> 40:31.429
I won?

40:31.929 --> 40:32.763
Ah! Yes!

40:33.389 --> 40:34.473
What's up, man?

40:35.599 --> 40:36.851
Why'd you do that?

40:37.518 --> 40:40.146
You picked 100.
That means you'll always lose.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.149
There's a zero percent chance of winning,
don't you know?

40:44.024 --> 40:46.944
I think all of you are overthinking this.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.823
That kind of stuff
just gives me a headache.

40:51.907 --> 40:53.409
So I blew it up.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.795
Wow, you're insane.

41:09.758 --> 41:13.554
<i>The winner of round six</i>
<i>is Master Chishiya.</i>

41:20.269 --> 41:22.897
<i>The winner of round seven is…</i>

41:24.106 --> 41:25.524
<i>…Master Daimon.</i>

41:28.819 --> 41:30.821
Oh yeah!

41:38.871 --> 41:41.749
I definitely don't wanna die like that.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.713
<i>I'm at minus nine points.</i>

41:47.796 --> 41:49.924
<i>If I miss any more, I die.</i>

41:50.424 --> 41:52.551
<i>My formula must be foolproof.</i>

41:57.139 --> 42:01.352
<i>What do I do? I'm so lost here.</i>
<i>I can't use the same strategy.</i>

42:02.353 --> 42:04.438
<i>I can't make a single mistake.</i>

42:04.939 --> 42:06.857
<i>The next time I lose, it's game over.</i>

42:08.234 --> 42:10.152
<i>Rationally speaking,</i>

42:10.903 --> 42:13.739
<i>the average</i>
<i>should be getting closer to zero.</i>

42:16.992 --> 42:19.119
<i>I bet he predicted this outcome.</i>

42:30.548 --> 42:33.008
<i>The winner of round ten is…</i>

42:34.009 --> 42:36.220
<i>…Master Kuzuryu.</i>

42:39.390 --> 42:42.935
<i>Two players</i>
<i>now have negative ten points.</i>

42:48.274 --> 42:51.819
<i>It is game over</i>
<i>for these participants.</i>

42:59.577 --> 43:03.163
Take this off! Someone!
I'll do anything!

43:03.998 --> 43:08.544
Don't! Ah! Take this off!
Hey! Take this off!

43:08.627 --> 43:09.670
What do you want, huh?

43:10.254 --> 43:12.089
You want money? Please!

43:12.172 --> 43:14.341
What can I do?

43:15.718 --> 43:18.220
Please, stop this! Just stop!

44:11.065 --> 44:13.484
Now, this is more like a face card game.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.363
Is this the equality you're after?

44:19.531 --> 44:22.076
<i>As two players were eliminated,</i>

44:22.159 --> 44:24.787
<i>two new rules will be added.</i>

44:24.870 --> 44:26.288
<i>Rule number one.</i>

44:26.372 --> 44:29.291
<i>If two or more players choose</i>
<i>the same number,</i>

44:29.375 --> 44:33.337
<i>they will be disqualified from the round</i>
<i>and will each lose one point.</i>

44:33.420 --> 44:35.005
<i>Rule number two.</i>

44:35.089 --> 44:36.965
<i>Choosing the exact correct number</i>

44:37.049 --> 44:41.303
<i>will cause the other players</i>
<i>to lose two points instead of one.</i>

45:08.163 --> 45:10.708
<i>Results for round 11.</i>

45:16.088 --> 45:18.132
All of us picked zero?

45:18.215 --> 45:23.345
<i>All three players picked the same number</i>
<i>and are disqualified from the round.</i>

45:23.429 --> 45:25.806
<i>All three players lose one point.</i>

45:25.889 --> 45:27.099
Huh?

45:27.182 --> 45:29.560
Everyone ended up
choosing the same number.

45:31.103 --> 45:35.065
<i>If that happens one more time,</i>
<i>it's game over for me.</i>

45:36.775 --> 45:39.570
<i>Round 12, start.</i>

45:50.205 --> 45:52.624
<i>Results for round 12.</i>

46:02.468 --> 46:05.679
<i>As the winner chose</i>
<i>the exact correct number,</i>

46:06.346 --> 46:09.516
<i>the other two players</i>
<i>will lose two points.</i>

46:12.102 --> 46:13.145
No way.

46:13.228 --> 46:15.981
No way! This can't be happening!
How did you…

46:17.524 --> 46:19.443
You saw my answer, didn't you?

46:19.526 --> 46:21.278
He cheated! He did!

46:21.361 --> 46:24.698
You did! How else would you be able
to know which number I chose?

46:24.782 --> 46:26.992
I knew it because I've been watching.

46:27.826 --> 46:31.455
At the start of the last round,
you had negative eight points,

46:32.039 --> 46:33.749
and I had negative nine.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.836
Even if you lost,
you'd still get another chance.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.714
So you took a risk,
thinking we'd eliminate each other.

46:40.798 --> 46:44.510
I thought about that,
and I figured you'd pick a random number.

46:44.593 --> 46:47.471
You want us to believe
you just guessed?

46:47.554 --> 46:48.472
Impossible!

46:48.555 --> 46:50.307
I knew what you thought we'd pick.

46:50.390 --> 46:52.935
Odds are we'd choose numbers under 50.

46:54.561 --> 46:56.855
<i>It's like he read my mind.</i>

46:57.689 --> 47:01.276
<i>The King was up by three points before.</i>

47:09.451 --> 47:12.454
<i>I couldn't catch up</i>
<i>if we chose the same number.</i>

47:17.793 --> 47:22.130
<i>But I still had a chance if I could</i>
<i>get them to pick the same number.</i>

47:27.344 --> 47:30.055
So you'd have to avoid
numbers under 50.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.766
And if you were going to do that,

47:32.850 --> 47:35.561
you'd have to avoid them
by a large margin.

47:36.144 --> 47:40.983
Even so, you wouldn't pick too high.
Ninety and up is too much.

47:41.066 --> 47:42.693
So over 50, under 90.

47:42.776 --> 47:46.154
When you ask people to guess a number,
a few things come to mind.

47:46.238 --> 47:48.115
Double digits, so they're out.

47:48.824 --> 47:52.494
Same thing with nice, round numbers
divisible by ten.

47:52.578 --> 47:56.081
When you put someone on the spot
and ask them to choose a number,

47:56.164 --> 47:58.458
they'll usually go for eights,
threes and fives,

47:58.542 --> 48:00.586
and some of those are prime.

48:00.669 --> 48:02.212
You'd try not to pick them.

48:02.296 --> 48:04.256
Not too many options left now.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.925
How do we narrow the list further?

48:07.009 --> 48:09.428
Some of these numbers we see every day.

48:09.928 --> 48:11.263
Game systems,

48:11.889 --> 48:13.473
movie titles,

48:13.557 --> 48:14.892
brand logos.

48:15.392 --> 48:17.019
Easy associations.

48:17.102 --> 48:20.856
By my count, that just leaves 62 and 74.

48:20.939 --> 48:22.691
No way to narrow it down.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.569
So I… Well,

48:26.612 --> 48:27.988
I got lucky.

48:29.531 --> 48:32.826
I knew
I shouldn't have picked 74.

48:34.620 --> 48:38.332
<i>A player now has negative ten points.</i>

48:41.251 --> 48:44.004
No, no. No. No, no!

48:44.087 --> 48:45.672
No! No, no!

48:45.756 --> 48:46.840
Don't!

48:46.924 --> 48:48.091
Please! Just let me go.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.260
I'll do anything! Let me go! Let me go!

48:50.344 --> 48:51.845
No!

49:07.653 --> 49:08.612
Well…

49:10.405 --> 49:13.200
She said that not all lives

49:13.909 --> 49:15.410
have the same value.

49:17.412 --> 49:19.164
Think she still believed it?

49:19.915 --> 49:21.792
Up until the bitter end?

49:26.088 --> 49:27.130
Tell me…

49:28.674 --> 49:32.386
Have you ever peered behind the curtain,
seen how the world really works?

49:35.138 --> 49:39.476
Watched children die because their parents
couldn't afford a few yen for medicine?

49:41.103 --> 49:44.523
Seen girls sold off
to pay for their parents' debts?

49:47.025 --> 49:50.445
Been powerless
to break the cycle of poverty?

49:54.408 --> 49:57.285
<i>A new rule is being added.</i>

49:58.495 --> 50:02.082
<i>If a player chooses zero as their number,</i>

50:02.165 --> 50:06.044
<i>the other player will win</i>
<i>if they choose 100.</i>

50:07.713 --> 50:09.047
A-ha.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.843
Since there's only two players
left in the game at this point,

50:13.635 --> 50:15.762
the one who picks closer to zero

50:15.846 --> 50:18.181
is inevitably going to be the winner.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.267
Just math.

50:20.350 --> 50:25.564
So if you pick zero each time, you'll win.
You're further from negative ten.

50:25.647 --> 50:27.941
But this new rule changes everything.

50:28.567 --> 50:29.943
I still have a chance.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.988
If you choose zero,

50:33.071 --> 50:35.240
I can win by choosing 100.

50:37.159 --> 50:39.870
But then if you think I'll choose 100,

50:41.538 --> 50:44.082
you can choose one, and you'll win.

50:45.834 --> 50:47.461
Three choices.

50:47.544 --> 50:50.297
It all comes down to three choices.

50:50.380 --> 50:53.133
Zero, one, and 100.

50:53.216 --> 50:56.011
Rock, paper, scissors.

51:00.807 --> 51:03.018
But I've only got one point left.

51:03.101 --> 51:06.146
If we tie,
that's game over for me, isn't it?

51:08.774 --> 51:10.942
The stakes couldn't be higher
if you tried.

51:15.155 --> 51:16.073
I get it.

51:16.865 --> 51:19.659
You're desperately trying
to make this fair.

51:20.619 --> 51:22.370
But why? Why bother?

51:25.749 --> 51:27.042
Hypothetically,

51:27.876 --> 51:31.046
if there were a million doses
of a vaccine for a disease,

51:32.672 --> 51:34.883
which million people would you save?

51:37.344 --> 51:38.804
Ahhh.

51:39.471 --> 51:40.847
I see it now.

51:42.641 --> 51:46.853
You don't wanna have to choose
who gets to live and who has to die.

51:48.146 --> 51:51.024
You don't want to determine
the value of a life.

51:51.900 --> 51:52.984
Exactly.

51:53.944 --> 51:56.071
How could I weigh all the variables?

51:56.863 --> 51:59.741
What makes one life worth saving

51:59.825 --> 52:01.284
and one worthless?

52:02.911 --> 52:04.079
How can I know?

52:06.957 --> 52:07.874
So,

52:08.917 --> 52:10.377
tell me what you think.

52:12.129 --> 52:15.090
If you had to answer
the question put before you…

52:16.800 --> 52:17.968
What I'd do?

52:18.051 --> 52:20.220
Give 'em to kids with no parents or money.

52:22.973 --> 52:23.974
You would?

52:24.057 --> 52:25.559
I would try to do that.

52:26.309 --> 52:28.687
But I wouldn't be the one to choose.

52:28.770 --> 52:29.938
It's about money.

52:30.605 --> 52:33.733
Because anyone with enough money
can choose a life's value.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.487
I bet you've seen it. Am I right?

52:38.196 --> 52:39.865
You've peered behind the curtain.

52:39.948 --> 52:40.991
I have.

52:41.950 --> 52:44.578
After an accident,
there was no settlement paid out.

52:45.370 --> 52:48.415
People died when they couldn't afford
the proper treatment.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.333
So you understand.

52:51.334 --> 52:53.879
Why do you bother
striving for justice at all?

52:53.962 --> 52:55.088
Because I must.

52:57.424 --> 52:59.342
Equality is something we fight for.

53:24.409 --> 53:27.037
Very good. You were great.

53:27.996 --> 53:29.664
Next week is the big day.

53:30.290 --> 53:31.583
You keep it up, okay?

53:34.586 --> 53:35.503
Yeah.

53:37.631 --> 53:39.090
Thank you.

53:40.675 --> 53:43.094
Doctor, thank you so much.

53:43.178 --> 53:44.888
Of course.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.058
-Excuse me.
-Yes, yes.

53:59.569 --> 54:01.947
Hayato's condition
is finally stable.

54:02.030 --> 54:05.200
And that means this next surgery
should save his life.

54:05.283 --> 54:07.118
Yes. About the surgery…

54:07.786 --> 54:08.912
Listen.

54:08.995 --> 54:11.665
There's been a change
to the transplant priority list.

54:11.748 --> 54:13.959
-You've made a change?
-Yes.

54:18.672 --> 54:20.882
This patient was just moved up the list.

54:25.220 --> 54:28.431
The grandchild
of a good friend of the director's.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.934
-And what about Hayato?
-Postponed.

54:31.851 --> 54:33.353
They're important.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.982
Their support keeps the hospital running.

54:40.193 --> 54:41.528
We don't have a choice.

54:42.279 --> 54:44.447
Medicine is all about this sort of thing.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.243
Now, go inform the patient's parents.

54:49.744 --> 54:51.162
But what do I say?

54:54.666 --> 54:57.794
You'll think of something.
He's your patient.

55:08.096 --> 55:09.431
Hayato…

55:21.192 --> 55:22.360
Well…

55:22.444 --> 55:24.821
Even if he got the transplant last week,

55:24.904 --> 55:27.157
there was a chance
he wasn't going to make it.

55:31.077 --> 55:32.412
This isn't my fault.

55:33.455 --> 55:37.250
You should know by now
your ideals aren't enough to save a life.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.424
That's clear.

55:46.634 --> 55:48.887
I'm not gonna carry it with me, sir.

55:51.681 --> 55:52.849
This is our job.

56:10.075 --> 56:11.868
SAKURAZAKA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

56:18.124 --> 56:21.044
PHYSICIAN
PEDIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY

56:27.258 --> 56:29.386
So, take care of it.

56:29.469 --> 56:30.387
Sir.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.610
How fascinating.

56:48.321 --> 56:50.698
Perhaps I was brought to this place

56:51.408 --> 56:53.743
so I could play this game with you.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.418
I'm going to choose 100.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.466
Why would you say that?

57:09.509 --> 57:11.177
Just giving you some help.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.847
Are you mad?

57:14.722 --> 57:16.850
You can't just tell me what you'll choose.

57:16.933 --> 57:20.145
Unless I select zero this round,
you've guaranteed your death.

57:24.232 --> 57:25.733
Sitting across from you

57:26.860 --> 57:29.279
is a man who is charging towards death.

57:30.947 --> 57:32.157
You have to decide.

57:33.074 --> 57:34.909
What value does this life hold?

57:36.202 --> 57:37.787
What value does my life hold?

58:23.082 --> 58:25.168
It's huge. Why bother?

58:28.087 --> 58:30.507
We lost everything
when we came here.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.722
To abandon our ideals would be mad.

58:46.606 --> 58:47.732
Ideals?

59:06.709 --> 59:07.919
Hey. Come on.

59:08.002 --> 59:11.756
What are you doing? Just go.

59:11.839 --> 59:12.966
I can't do that.

59:13.758 --> 59:17.136
In the last game I played,
a young man saved my life.

59:17.971 --> 59:20.890
Now it's my turn to save someone.
I have to pay it forward.

59:23.309 --> 59:24.894
You're not getting left behind.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.188
I'm choosing to fight for this.

59:31.025 --> 59:32.151
You're choosing?

59:34.529 --> 59:35.572
Now let's go.

1:00:00.263 --> 1:00:02.557
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:05.143
<i>The winner of round 13 is…</i>

1:00:06.936 --> 1:00:08.771
<i>…Master Chishiya.</i>

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:16.362
You actually selected zero?

1:00:25.371 --> 1:00:28.082
<i>Round 14, start.</i>

1:00:45.933 --> 1:00:49.812
<i>The winner of round 14 is Master Chishiya.</i>

1:01:00.948 --> 1:01:04.202
That's it then, isn't it?
Only one point left each.

1:01:04.285 --> 1:01:05.787
This is the last round.

1:01:10.792 --> 1:01:14.212
<i>Round 15, start.</i>

1:01:19.759 --> 1:01:20.802
So, then,

1:01:21.761 --> 1:01:22.970
can you do it?

1:01:27.308 --> 1:01:29.727
If you're finding it hard
to make your choice,

1:01:30.353 --> 1:01:31.771
you can just kill me.

1:01:32.855 --> 1:01:34.482
That's fair, don't you think?

1:01:36.442 --> 1:01:38.444
I cannot make that decision.

1:01:39.779 --> 1:01:42.949
Was that your aim the whole time,
Master Chishiya?

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:45.451
To make sure
that our scores ended up tied?

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:48.538
In a way.

1:01:50.289 --> 1:01:52.041
I wanted to witness this.

1:01:53.334 --> 1:01:56.003
I wanted to be around
for your final choice.

1:02:12.311 --> 1:02:15.022
If you pick one, you win.

1:02:28.703 --> 1:02:29.871
Ms. Momoka.

1:02:32.331 --> 1:02:34.375
Would you answer a question for me?

1:02:36.669 --> 1:02:38.129
You volunteered.

1:02:38.212 --> 1:02:39.881
Someone had to be the witch.

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:41.591
But that means killing yourself.

1:02:47.930 --> 1:02:49.223
Why would you do that?

1:02:51.434 --> 1:02:52.810
I did it for my ideals.

1:02:57.815 --> 1:03:00.067
The human heart is
a beautiful thing.

1:03:02.195 --> 1:03:04.071
Human life is precious.

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:06.491
I believe that, truly.

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:11.245
And when I look at my life,

1:03:12.121 --> 1:03:15.666
I know I've been able to survive
because of those ideals.

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:24.091
Your games and rules don't get to kill me.

1:03:26.636 --> 1:03:29.055
I'm not going to die because I lost.

1:03:31.849 --> 1:03:34.644
I'm doing this
to show you all that you're wrong.

1:03:36.020 --> 1:03:39.273
They're not going to kill each other
because they're not all bad.

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:49.408
If I'm destined to die here someday…

1:03:51.786 --> 1:03:54.163
then I get to choose how I walk that path.

1:04:01.003 --> 1:04:02.672
<i>I'm just one man.</i>

1:04:04.465 --> 1:04:06.384
<i>I don't know the value of a life.</i>

1:04:07.051 --> 1:04:08.427
<i>Or the meaning of one.</i>

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:14.475
And I don't think I ever will.

1:04:15.768 --> 1:04:17.645
I'll never be the one to decide that.

1:04:21.899 --> 1:04:24.193
But there's one thing
I'm able to decide now.

1:04:49.510 --> 1:04:52.179
<i>The final round is over.</i>

1:04:58.311 --> 1:04:59.937
So you made your choice.

1:05:01.522 --> 1:05:03.441
The value of a life can't be decided.

1:05:04.609 --> 1:05:05.902
Tell me why you did it.

1:05:11.699 --> 1:05:13.409
I did it for my ideals.

1:05:15.661 --> 1:05:17.371
<i>The winner is</i>

1:05:17.455 --> 1:05:19.040
<i>Master Chishiya.</i>

1:05:22.418 --> 1:05:25.671
<i>A player has reached negative ten points.</i>

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:29.216
<i>It is game over for that player.</i>

1:05:34.096 --> 1:05:36.599
It's nice to see
that you can actually smile.

1:05:38.017 --> 1:05:39.393
I'm finally free.

1:05:44.190 --> 1:05:46.067
I made my own choice.

1:05:48.110 --> 1:05:49.779
And based on my own ideals.

1:06:05.169 --> 1:06:06.587
It's all because of you.

1:06:20.059 --> 1:06:22.687
At last. It's our turn.

1:06:28.609 --> 1:06:29.527
What?

1:06:31.195 --> 1:06:32.613
That doesn't excite you?

1:06:36.158 --> 1:06:38.327
If I'm going to have a game to myself…

1:06:40.579 --> 1:06:42.039
I want it to be fair.

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:19.577
You quit while you were ahead.

1:07:20.453 --> 1:07:22.705
I gave you the chance to make that choice.

1:07:24.999 --> 1:07:26.542
I'm so jealous of you.

1:08:04.705 --> 1:08:08.959
GAME CLEAR
CONGRATULATIONS

1:09:07.643 --> 1:09:09.854
We've almost died
a thousand times.

1:09:10.938 --> 1:09:12.690
We could still die, any second.

1:09:16.152 --> 1:09:17.278
I don't believe it.

1:09:18.445 --> 1:09:20.865
It's a miracle we made it
as far as we have.

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:27.329
If it was a miracle that got us here,

1:09:29.165 --> 1:09:31.125
let's take the opportunity and fight.

1:09:33.836 --> 1:09:34.837
Me and you.

1:09:37.506 --> 1:09:38.382
Yeah.

1:10:11.582 --> 1:10:13.042
I'm going to make it home.

1:11:04.176 --> 1:11:06.887
For the future. For the me of tomorrow.
