Oh, no cousin,
I tied the last of it around

01:28.755 --> 01:30.290
my finger to remind me..

01:31.658 --> 01:34.294
..to buy dental floss.

the tip of your pen in the glob

02:37.591 --> 02:40.460

right back up inside itself?

‐ Yes, yes...we're friends.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.735
Mmm.

11:43.504 --> 11:45.071
I'm sorry I got so upset

11:45.105 --> 11:47.040
it's just that I am so nervous
about this lunch.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.242
Oh, I know, I know.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.377
‐ Can we take these off?
‐ Oh, okay.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.816
Appleton.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.117
Uh, yes, sir.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.084
Uh..

11:59.953 --> 12:01.988
Will you excuse us,
Bartokomous?

12:09.029 --> 12:10.263
Appleton, I..

12:14.467 --> 12:16.537
Appleton?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.304
Excuse us, Balki.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.213
I suppose you're wondering
why I'm taking you to lunch.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.082
Yes, as a matter of fact
I was, sir.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.451
Well, I didn't want to
tell you before because

12:31.484 --> 12:33.119
quite frankly,
you're a little high strung.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.821
You know,
I've noticed that myself.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.489
because there are that times
when I just think

12:36.523 --> 12:38.224
this man is just
gonna pop..

12:38.258 --> 12:40.326
I‐I‐I beg your pardon,
I couldn't help overhearing

12:40.360 --> 12:42.963
but I'll be right over here
in case anybody needs me.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.935
The other day..

12:51.905 --> 12:53.974
...Mr. Wainwright asked me
which of my reporters

12:54.007 --> 12:56.409
showed the most potential.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.012
And in a very weak moment
I mentioned your name.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.481
You told the publisher that?

13:01.515 --> 13:04.384
Yes, he wants to meet you,
so he's joining us for lunch.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.553
Be at the restaurant at 1:00.

13:06.587 --> 13:09.122
I'm meeting the publisher?
Mr. Bainwright?

13:09.155 --> 13:10.223
I mean Mr. Wainwright.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.424
I hope I get his name right.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.260
Oh, oh, oh, alright.
Listen to me.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.395
[laughs]

13:15.428 --> 13:16.997
Appleton...you're babbling.

13:17.030 --> 13:17.898
'Yes, sir.'

13:19.199 --> 13:21.367
Now, please,
don't do that at lunch.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.238
Balki, did you hear that?

13:25.271 --> 13:26.907
I'm having lunch
with the publisher.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.409
Well, of course I heard it,
I was standing right here.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.977
‐ Balki, take these off.
‐ Okay.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.546
‐ Hurry.
‐ Okay.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.581
‐ Alright, here, let me do it.
‐ Cousin, I know how do it.

13:34.615 --> 13:36.883
‐ I can do it quicker‐‐
‐ Cousin, I know how do it.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.987
The key broke.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.893
Well, now you've done it.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.229
[instrumental music]

13:54.968 --> 13:56.903
[instrumental music]

14:06.513 --> 14:08.949
Hello, I'm Marcel.
Your maitre d'.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.217
I'm Larry Appleton,
I'm with the Burns' party.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.919
I'll check on your table.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.255
Uh, perhaps you would like
to look at our menu?

14:19.593 --> 14:20.561
Thank you.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.300
Balki, we're in luck.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.603
Mr. Burns and Mr. Wainwright
aren't here yet.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.138
We'll sit at tables
that are next to each other.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.574
If we keep our hands
out of sight

14:33.607 --> 14:36.309
no one will know
we're handcuffed.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.179
Ah! Mr. Burns?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.414
No, this isn't Mr. Burns.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.549
This way, sir.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.017
I'll be with you
in a moment.

14:48.589 --> 14:51.958
We're not together but we'd like
to sit near each other.

14:56.597 --> 14:59.132
We get lonely easily.

15:01.702 --> 15:03.504
Of course.

15:03.537 --> 15:05.606
Here are two tables.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.307
Are they close enough?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.075
Yes, this is fine.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.354
I think things are going well,
don't you?

15:21.387 --> 15:24.490
Well, yes I do. Except that
I have no feeling in my thumb.

15:29.029 --> 15:29.930
Ahem!

15:29.963 --> 15:31.532
Oh, Appleton,
you got here early. Good.

15:31.565 --> 15:33.600
R.T., this is Larry Appleton.

15:33.634 --> 15:34.467
How do you do?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.336
Harry's been telling me
a lot about you.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.170
Oh, well.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.271
Harry, could we sit
at another table?

15:38.304 --> 15:40.373
I always sit in the no smoking
section, it's healthier.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.375
Ordinarily, I'd agree.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.014
Uh, but while I was waiting
for you I had a chance to study

15:48.048 --> 15:51.117
the air currents wafting,
wafting through the room.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.254
'And I noticed
that the smoke is being blown'

15:54.287 --> 15:57.023
directly into
the no smoking area.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.159
So, that while it may seem
that the no smoking section

15:59.192 --> 16:02.228
is healthier than the smoking
section, the truth is‐‐

16:02.262 --> 16:03.664
Appleton...you're babbling.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.366
Yes, sir.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.234
Why don't we sit
at another table?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.404
First time in a restaurant,
Appleton?

16:11.437 --> 16:12.438
Pull yourself together!

16:16.109 --> 16:17.077
Oh.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.017
You know, I think you handled
that rather well.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.418
Thank you.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.420
Alright, I'll sit there,
you sit there, come on.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.156
O‐oh! There's somebody sitting
at that table!

16:30.824 --> 16:32.492
Make friends.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.730
Uh, sorry about that
air current thing

16:36.763 --> 16:38.799
it's just that I'm so
nervous about meeting

16:38.832 --> 16:40.366
the paplisher of the publer.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.535
The peeblisher of the pobler.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.670
The publisher of the paper.

16:43.704 --> 16:45.338
Is it getting warm in here?

16:45.371 --> 16:47.608
Appleton, will you
for God's sake sit down!

16:47.641 --> 16:48.609
Yes, sir.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.014
Hello.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.619
Oh, Mrs. Van Wisser.

16:58.652 --> 17:01.788
Young man, are you being paid
to destroy me?

17:04.424 --> 17:07.560
If you aren't out of here
in ten seconds..

17:07.594 --> 17:09.194
...I am calling the police.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.637
Excuse me for just one moment.

17:17.671 --> 17:18.605
So, Larry, tell me

17:18.638 --> 17:21.340
when did you decide
to become a newspaper man?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.576
Well, an interesting story.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.578
I started out
as a photographer..

17:24.611 --> 17:25.345
Wo..

17:29.115 --> 17:31.417
Cousin, I've got to
talk to you.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.353
Balki, not now.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.822
Appleton,
what are you doing?

17:35.856 --> 17:38.692
I dropped a contact lens.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.127
Cousin, I'm sitting
with Mrs. Van Wisser

17:41.161 --> 17:45.265
and she has made it very clear
that she wants to dine alone.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.435
Cousin, I've got to
get out of here.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.739
‐ Balki, you can't.
‐ Yes, I can.

17:52.773 --> 17:54.274
Sorry, I just thought that..

17:54.307 --> 17:56.577
Oh, ah!
I'll‐I'll be right back.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.212
What are you doing?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.848
Cousin, if I don't get out
of here right now

18:01.882 --> 18:03.483
Mrs. Van Wisser
will call the police!

18:03.517 --> 18:05.218
Balki, if I don't go back
to that table

18:05.251 --> 18:06.553
I'm going to
lose my job!

18:06.587 --> 18:08.421
Leaving so soon?

18:09.355 --> 18:10.691
No, no.

18:10.724 --> 18:13.794
Uh, I was just looking
for a chair for my friend.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.195
Oh!
Here's one.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.132
Come on.
Just follow my lead.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.139
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi!

18:29.342 --> 18:30.644
Hi.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.346
Appleton, what in the hell
are you doing?

18:33.379 --> 18:34.347
Small world.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.682
I thought I saw
my cousin, Balki

18:35.716 --> 18:37.884
and well,
sure enough I did.

18:37.918 --> 18:39.753
Big deal, you work together.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.589
Yes, but he is such
an interesting man that if he's

18:42.623 --> 18:44.457
gone for more than a minute
your life gets boring.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.692
[chuckles]

18:45.726 --> 18:48.261
Uh, Mr. Wainwright,
Balki Bartokomous.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.663
A pleasure.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.270
Balki's from Mypos.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.305
An ambidextrous island.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.680
But, uh, where are
our manners?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.615
Uh, Balki,
won't you join us?

19:08.649 --> 19:10.383
‐ Oh, I couldn't possibly.
‐ Oh, please.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.785
Oh, no, absolutely
out of the question.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.720
‐ Oh, you must.
‐ It's simply
out of the question.

19:13.754 --> 19:15.589
‐ I insist.
‐ Well, just this once.

19:25.566 --> 19:27.734
Just where is Mypos,
Mr. Bartokomous?

19:27.768 --> 19:30.036
Well, it's in the Southeastern
Mediterranean.

19:33.907 --> 19:34.975
That's funny, I thought
I knew all the islands

19:35.008 --> 19:37.778
in the Mediterranean.
I was a war correspondent there.

19:37.811 --> 19:40.781
Well, um,
Mypos is very small.

19:40.814 --> 19:43.283
During the war it was used
for target practice.

19:44.985 --> 19:47.253
Would you like some food
of your own, Bartokomous?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.755
Oh, no, no, no.

19:48.789 --> 19:50.891
This is fine! So full.
This is fine.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.959
Oh, well, we enjoy
doing things together.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.630
Did I mention
that we're cousins?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.268
Were your parents
cousins, too?

20:08.975 --> 20:11.311
Is there something wrong
with your left hand, young man?

20:11.344 --> 20:12.613
I notice you don't use
it at all.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.981
No, no, I just..
I like to save it

20:15.015 --> 20:17.483
for...emergencies.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.888
‐ Emergencies?
‐ 'Yes.'

20:24.357 --> 20:25.258
Of course.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.495
But enough about me!

20:29.530 --> 20:31.031
Uh, why don't we just enjoy

20:31.064 --> 20:32.566
this delicious, uh, lunch?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.267
Uh, more bread,
Mr. Wainwright?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.269
Ooh! Oh,
I'm so sorry.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.438
I‐I‐I..

20:38.471 --> 20:41.775
Appleton, you'd better have
a good explanation for this!

20:41.808 --> 20:43.844
Oh! Oh! E‐explanation!

20:43.877 --> 20:45.311
Oh, you dood I be.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.281
You di dee boo.
You bet I do.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.983
This‐this could happen
to anyone.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.585
It happened to me.
It happened to him.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.754
Happened to the both of us.
Ever happen to you?

20:55.088 --> 20:57.524
Cousin...you're babbling.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.594
Well, nip feedle stip net.

21:04.698 --> 21:07.433
[instrumental music]

21:14.508 --> 21:15.475
[laughter]

21:16.610 --> 21:18.078
So, what could I do?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.714
I finished the Churchill
interview with my finger

21:20.747 --> 21:21.748
stuck in his brandy bottle.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.484
[all laughing]

21:24.518 --> 21:26.486
Well, it's a great pleasure
to meet you boys.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.793
Oh, you were right, Harry.

21:32.826 --> 21:34.961
He's a little high strung
but he's got potential.

21:37.998 --> 21:40.901
Appleton, I hope you realize
you're very lucky!

21:40.934 --> 21:42.803
Yes‐yes, sir,
I‐I know, sir. I know.

21:42.836 --> 21:43.837
I‐I..

21:45.939 --> 21:47.741
We're lucky Mr. Wainwright
has a sense of humor.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.944
Mmm, we're lucky we didn't have
to go to the men's room.

21:53.013 --> 21:53.980
Good point.

21:55.949 --> 21:57.784
‐ Cousin.
‐ What?

21:57.818 --> 21:59.419
I got to say something.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.355
None of this
would have happened if‐‐

22:02.388 --> 22:03.524
‐ I know.
‐ Cousin‐‐

22:03.557 --> 22:05.425
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.030
‐ None of this would have‐‐
‐ I know.

22:10.063 --> 22:12.966
You're going to say that none
of this would have happened

22:12.999 --> 22:15.468
if I had talked to you
when I was angry.

22:16.637 --> 22:19.472
I was wrong.
And I'm sorry.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.108
Oh, cousin,
that's very nice.

22:22.142 --> 22:23.977
That isn't actually
what I was going to say.

22:26.747 --> 22:28.949
What I was going
to say is

22:28.982 --> 22:31.585
none of this would have happened
if I had just been patient

22:31.618 --> 22:34.821
and waited for you to find
a time to talk to me.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.357
I was just trying to follow
my Myposian proverb.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.462
Well, Balki, nobody enjoys
a good Myposian proverb

22:42.495 --> 22:43.964
more than I do.

22:45.599 --> 22:48.902
But life is a little
more complicated in America.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.905
You might have to adjust
your proverbs.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.975
Well, I‐I guess they could use
some fine tuning.

22:55.008 --> 22:58.812
You know, on Mypos when we say
we have to talk right now

22:58.845 --> 23:00.847
it's not so much
a problem because

23:00.881 --> 23:04.551
there's really nothing
else to do.

23:07.721 --> 23:09.856
How was your lunch?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.457
What happened?

23:11.491 --> 23:14.027
You two guys look like
Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.565
Well, actually, you both look
like Tony Curtis.

23:21.134 --> 23:22.803
Oh, it's a long story.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.470
