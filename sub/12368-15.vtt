WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.628
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.711 --> 00:05.630
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.590
- THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.134
- OH, IT CERTAINLY IS.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.552
WHOEVER CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA

00:10.635 --> 00:12.637
OF JOINING A COUNTRY CLUB
IS A GENIUS.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.097
- IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

00:14.180 --> 00:17.892
- OH,
COMPLIMENT ACCEPTED.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.894
AH, THIS PLACE
SMELLS LIKE MONEY.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.271
OLD MONEY.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.107
THE KIND OF MONEY
MONEY CAN'T BUY.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.942
- LOOK AT THIS
MEMBERSHIP LIST.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.277
THEY'RE ALL RUBBER BARONS.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.612
FIRESTONE,
GOODRICH, GOODYEAR.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.114
- FORGET PORSCHES.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.659
WE COULD BE DATING MEN
WHO OWN THEIR OWN BLIMPS.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.121
- OOH, LOOK AT THIS NAME--
PRESTON VANDERBOSH III.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.330
YOU KNOW,
IF WE GET INTO THIS CLUB,

00:39.414 --> 00:41.791
I'M GONNA MARRY HIM
AND PEOPLE WILL SAY,

00:41.875 --> 00:43.668
"MELANIE VANDERBOSH,

00:43.752 --> 00:46.171
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT,
BUT ARE YOU REALLY HAPPY?"

00:46.254 --> 00:48.298
AND I'LL SAY,
"NOT ALWAYS,"

00:48.381 --> 00:50.842
IN A WAY THAT MEANS YES.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.969
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
<i>IF</i> WE GET IN?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.722
I'M A CELEBRITY, AND EVERYONE
LOVES CELEBRITIES.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.516
WE ARE AN ARISTOCRACY
CONSISTING OF THE TALENTED

00:58.600 --> 01:02.520
AND PEOPLE WHO GIVE BIRTH
TO QUINTUPLETS OR HIGHER.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.855
- AND I HAVE
MY ENGLISH ACCENT.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.525
IT'S THE PREFERRED ACCENT OF
SNOBBY PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.486
- YEAH,
ALL I HAVE IS ABC.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.781
ALWAYS BE CLEAVAGING.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.365
- HELLO, LADIES.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.658
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.494
- SORRY TO
KEEP YOU WAITING,

01:17.577 --> 01:19.871
BUT SOMEONE WAS WEARING
GRASS COURT SNEAKERS

01:19.954 --> 01:21.372
ON THE CLAY COURT!

01:21.456 --> 01:23.666
- OH, IT'S DISGUSTING.
- THE NERVE OF SOME PEOPLE.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.835
- I'M JAMESON LYONS.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.296
- HERE ARE
OUR APPLICATIONS.

01:28.379 --> 01:32.383
- OH, YES.
VICTORIA CHASE.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.719
"SPECIAL SKILLS--
ONCE FLEW IN A JET

01:34.803 --> 01:36.846
PILOTED BY JOHN TRAVOLTA."

01:36.930 --> 01:39.307
- I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DROPPED A CELEBRITY NAME.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.059
IT'S UNCOUTH.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.144
THE DALAI LAMA
TAUGHT ME THAT...

01:43.228 --> 01:46.481
IN THE BACK
OF JOHN TRAVOLTA'S PLANE.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.026
- THAT'S FASCINATING,
BUT WHO'S BOUNCING YOU?

01:50.109 --> 01:51.361
- OH, I BOUNCE.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.489
IT'S JUST THE WAY
I'M BUILT.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.157
I HOPE THAT WON'T BE
A PROBLEM.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.117
- YOUNG LADY, THIS IS
NOT AN APPLICATION

01:58.201 --> 02:00.578
TO WAIT TABLES AT HOOTERS.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.873
- "YOUNG" LADY.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.209
- TO JOIN THE CLUB,
YOU HAVE TO BE BOUNCED

02:06.292 --> 02:07.001
OR SPONSORED
BY A CURRENT MEMBER.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.586
DO YOU KNOW
ANY CURRENT MEMBERS?

02:08.669 --> 02:10.839
- I KNOW YOU.
CHARMING YOU.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.715
- [laughs]
YES.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.344
YEAH, WELL, ANYWAY,
THE RUBBER BALL IS COMING UP.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.347
IT'S A CHARITY EVENT,
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.391
PERHAPS YOU COULD MEET
SOME MEMBERS THERE.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.726
- THAT SOUNDS IDEAL.
COUNT US IN.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.937
- TICKETS ARE $5,000.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.230
- [laughs]

02:27.313 --> 02:28.898
MAYBE WE COULD PAY
WITH A RUBBER CHECK.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.734
[laughter]

02:31.818 --> 02:33.862
- [clears throat]

02:33.945 --> 02:36.656
- I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR 70 YEARS,

02:36.739 --> 02:39.409
AND IF YOU THINK THERE'S
A RUBBER JOKE I HAVEN'T HEARD,

02:39.492 --> 02:41.411
YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.

02:41.494 --> 02:45.665
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.
- CHEERIO!

02:45.748 --> 02:47.750
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE
GETTING INTO THIS PLACE

02:47.834 --> 02:49.085
IS IF WE GO TO THAT PARTY.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.795
- YEAH, BUT $5,000
A TICKET?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.380
- OH, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.425
YOU COULD BUY THREE PAIRS
OF SHOES FOR THAT.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.093
- BUT WE HAVE TO GO.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.761
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.388
THEY'VE BEEN THROWING
LAVISH PARTIES

03:00.471 --> 03:01.973
SINCE BEFORE WE WERE BORN.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.643
{\an1}- OH, I BET PRESTON VANDERBOSH
THE FIRST IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.145
- WAIT A MINUTE.

03:07.228 --> 03:11.566
IS IT ME, OR DOES THAT WAITRESS
LOOK LIKE A YOUNG ELKA?

03:16.195 --> 03:18.573
- YEAH, I WORKED THERE
WHEN I WAS IN MY TWENTIES.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.826
I HATE THAT PLACE,
AND I WAS FIRED

03:21.910 --> 03:24.495
WHEN MY BOSS HIT ON ME
AND I TURNED HIM DOWN.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.496
- NOW, NOW.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.040
YOU CAN'T JUDGE
THE ENTIRE CLUB

03:27.123 --> 03:31.336
BY ONE GUY WHO WORKED THERE
BACK IN THE 1800s.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.796
- YEAH, EVERYONE WE DEALT WITH
WAS VERY NICE.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.799
- JAMESON LYONS CALLED ME
A "YOUNG LADY."

03:36.883 --> 03:39.969
- JAMESON LYONS?
THAT'S THE MAN WHO FIRED ME!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.346
- I'M SORRY, ELKA,

03:41.429 --> 03:43.640
BUT WE ALREADY BOUGHT
TICKETS TO THE BALL.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.434
- FINE, GO.
SEE IF I CARE.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.229
- OH, POOR CINDER-ELKA.
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BALL.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.315
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE BALL.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.610
- I KNOW.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.154
- YOU KNOW THAT MAKES YOU
THE UGLY STEPSISTER.

04:10.249 --> 04:15.004
{\an8}- OH, I WONDER IF
PRESTON VANDERBOSH III IS HERE?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.255
{\an8}I KNOW, I'M GONNA
FIND HIS PLACE-CARD

04:16.339 --> 04:17.464
{\an8}AND PUT IT NEXT TO MINE.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.801
{\an8}- REMEMBER, THE IDEA
ISN'T TO MEET MEN.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.260
{\an8}IT'S TO GET BOUNCED,
SO WE CAN COME BACK

04:21.344 --> 04:22.845
{\an8}AND MEET MEN
WHENEVER WE PLEASE.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.389
{\an8}- OH, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

04:24.472 --> 04:28.142
{\an8}I DIDN'T RENT $200,000 EARRINGS
TO COME HOME EMPTY-HANDED.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.186
{\an8}- OH, ARE THOSE EARRINGS?

04:30.269 --> 04:33.022
{\an8}I THOUGHT YOU WERE DRESSED
AS A CHANDELIER.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.565
{\an8}- YOU KNOW,
THESE SEND THE MESSAGE

04:34.649 --> 04:36.859
{\an8}THAT I DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY
BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN,

04:36.943 --> 04:38.569
{\an8}AND THAT WAY,
THEY'LL LAVISH ME WITH GIFTS

04:38.653 --> 04:40.989
{\an8}THAT I "DON'T NEED."

04:41.072 --> 04:43.616
{\an8}- BARNABY GOODRICH,
IS THAT YOU?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.369
{\an8}- GOODRICH?
THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.664
{\an8}BOTH GOOD AND RICH.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.582
{\an8}- OKAY,
WHERE DO WE START?

04:51.666 --> 04:54.544
{\an8}- WELL, FIRST, I'VE DROPPED
MY USUAL LONDON COMMON ACCENT

04:54.627 --> 04:57.338
{\an8}AND ADOPTED THE MORE POSH
SLOANE RANGER ACCENT.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.676
{\an8}- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
- A TIGHTER BUTT CLENCH.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.804
{\an8}NOW, WHO MIGHT BOUNCE ME?

05:04.887 --> 05:07.223
{\an8}AH, DIGNIFIED OLDER WOMEN

05:07.306 --> 05:08.933
{\an8}ARE SUCKERS
FOR A BRITISH ACCENT.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.562
{\an8}TIME TO WORK MY CHARM.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.147
{\an8}EXCUSE ME.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.233
{\an8}ELKA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:17.316 --> 05:20.403
{\an8}- I'M HERE TO HUMILIATE JAMESON
FOR WHAT HE DID TO ME.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.280
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
THROW A DRINK IN HIS FACE?

05:22.363 --> 05:25.742
- NO, I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
FALL IN LOVE WITH ME,

05:25.825 --> 05:28.202
REVEAL MY TRUE IDENTITY,

05:28.286 --> 05:31.581
AND THEN THROW A DRINK
IN HIS FACE.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.792
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU?

05:34.876 --> 05:38.087
- WELL, HE WAS ATTRACTED TO ME
65 YEARS AGO,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.423
AND I'VE ONLY
GOTTEN PRETTIER.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.717
- OKAY.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.637
WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
KEEP IN MIND, I DON'T KNOW YOU.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.807
- OH, THIS NIGHT KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.353
- EXCUSE ME.

05:54.437 --> 05:59.358
I NOTICED YOUR BLUE EYES
FROM CLEAR ACROSS THE ROOM.

05:59.442 --> 06:04.614
- WELL, MY BLUE EYES
LIKE WHAT THEY SEE TOO.

06:04.697 --> 06:08.284
- I CAN'T HELP FEELING
I'VE MET YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.952
- DID YOU?

06:10.036 --> 06:13.331
- AH, YOU'RE
THE MYSTERIOUS TYPE, HUH?

06:13.414 --> 06:16.626
- OR AM I?

06:16.709 --> 06:20.963
- JAMESON LYONS.
- I'M...SABRINA.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.759
- OH, LIKE THE MOVIE?
- NO, LIKE THE TEENAGE WITCH.

06:24.842 --> 06:29.639
- OH, WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY
CASTING A SPELL ON ME.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.975
- JOY?
- COLIN?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.811
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.188
- DARE I SAY, SCROGGS,
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.649
- YOU CAN SAY IT,
BUT I'LL IGNORE IT.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.442
- YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU

06:41.526 --> 06:42.568
QUITE A BIT LATELY.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.488
- REALLY? AND YET I HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM YOU IN WEEKS.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.240
NO CALLS, NO TEXTS.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.158
- WELL, THERE IS
AN EXPLANATION.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.495
- HI, FIANCE.
[laughs]

06:52.578 --> 06:58.876
THAT IS SO MUCH FUN TO SAY.
FIANCE, FIANCE, FIANCE.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.294
- JOY, THIS IS PRESHI.
SHE'S MY--

07:00.378 --> 07:02.004
- FIANCEE?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.673
- FUN TO SAY, RIGHT?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.341
- WELL, IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU,

07:05.424 --> 07:08.094
AND CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.721
- THANKS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S
ANOTHER FUN WORD TO SAY?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.723
OINTMENT.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.017
SAY IT.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.185
- OINTMENT.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.688
- AH!
[laughs]

07:18.771 --> 07:21.691
ISN'T HE PRETTY?

07:21.774 --> 07:24.360
AND HE LOVES ME FOR ME,
NOT MY TRUST FUNDS.

07:24.443 --> 07:29.031
HE TOLD ME SO WHEN HE CONVINCED
ME NOT TO DO A PRENUP.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.533
THAT'S LOVE.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.493
- DARLING, WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND OUR TABLE?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.203
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THAT.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.539
- SAY "GOOD-BYE"
IN A BABY VOICE.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.832
- [high-pitched]
GOOD-BYE.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.917
- [laughs]

07:44.213 --> 07:47.550
- WELL, SHE SEEMS
LIKE A CATCH.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.552
- LOOK, IN A PERFECT WORLD,

07:49.635 --> 07:51.512
SHE WOULDN'T BE
WHO I'D BE WITH TONIGHT,

07:51.596 --> 07:53.556
BUT WE'RE BOTH BRITISH.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.894
YOU KNOW HOW FAST THIS THIN,
PASTY SKIN AGES.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.104
I WON'T BE A TV NEWS IDOL
FOREVER, JOY.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.772
THIS IS MY RETIREMENT PLAN.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.608
- SO YOU'RE MARRYING
FOR MONEY.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.276
VERY CLASSY.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.445
- I CAN SEE YOU'RE HURT.
- I AM NOT HURT.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.405
IT JUST SO HAPPENS,
I'VE MOVED ON AS WELL.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.240
- OH, IS THAT SO?
- YES.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.742
I'M SURE HE'S HERE
SOMEWHERE.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.619
- HELLO, JOY.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.625
- OPERA GUY?

08:20.708 --> 08:21.918
- PLEASE.

08:22.001 --> 08:27.131
IN PUBLIC,
CALL ME ARTIE FIRESTONE IV.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.926
- YOU'RE DATING
ARTIE FIRESTONE IV?

08:30.009 --> 08:35.056
- NO, I AM ARTIE FIRESTONE IV,
AND SHE IS DATING ME.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.599
RIGHT, SWEET CHEEKS?

08:36.682 --> 08:37.933
[slaps]
MMM!

08:38.017 --> 08:40.144
NOW DO ME.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.610
- DATING A FIRESTONE.
I'M IMPRESSED.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.987
AND MORE THAN
A LITTLE SURPRISED.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.781
- THE NIGHT IS FULL
OF SURPRISES.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.990
- WELL, IT'S GOOD THAT
WE'VE BOTH FOUND PEOPLE

08:53.074 --> 08:53.991
THAT MAKE US SO HAPPY.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.368
- WE'VE BOTH MOVED ON

08:55.451 --> 08:57.954
AND ARE HAPPY IN OUR
RESPECTIVE RELATIONSHIPS.

08:58.037 --> 09:04.126
- YOU TWO HAVE AN ODD WAY
OF SPEAKING.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.963
- REALLY?
A PLACE IN PARIS, YOU SAY?

09:07.046 --> 09:08.589
WELL, THIS IS DESTINY.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.967
J'ADORE PARIS.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.677
- IT'S JUST
A PIED-A-TERRE.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.262
I BOUGHT IT
FROM RICHARD CASWELL

09:14.345 --> 09:16.138
WHEN HE PURCHASED
HIS ESTATE ON THE RIVIERA.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.140
- ESTATE, YOU SAY?
- LOVELY PLACE.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.309
ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF
MY CASTLE IN SCOTLAND.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.396
- CASTLE, YOU SAY?

09:23.479 --> 09:25.982
- AH, HELLO.
- HI.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.275
OH, I'M SORRY.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.818
I'M SAVING THIS SEAT

THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, "WHY DO
YOU TALK SO MUCH, PRESHI?"

09:43.416 --> 09:47.003
AND, "WHY ARE YOU SITTING
SO CLOSE TO ME, PRESHI?"

09:47.086 --> 09:50.381
- WH--WHY ARE YOU SITTING
SO CLOSE TO ME?

09:50.464 --> 09:53.050

AND YOURS JUST STOOD RIGHT UP.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.518

IT WAS A PACKING CRATE.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.779
ARE YOU REALLY A FIRESTONE?
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.156
- PERHAPS
I CAN BEST EXPLAIN

10:15.239 --> 10:18.868
IN A POWERPOINT
DEMONSTRATION.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.204

10:22.288 --> 10:25.207

THE FIRESTONE FAMILY.

IN A FABULOUS MANSION.

[clears throat]

10:31.797 --> 10:36.552
NEXT SLIDE!

10:36.635 --> 10:39.221
AS A YOUTH,
I HAD A REBELLIOUS STAGE,

10:39.305 --> 10:41.474
AND I WAS CUT OFF
FROM THE FAMILY MONEY.

10:41.557 --> 10:47.813
BUT THEN, LAST YEAR,
AT THE AGE OF FORTY-NINE...TEEN,

10:47.897 --> 10:50.274
I WAS ONCE AGAIN GIVEN ACCESS
TO THE MONEY,

10:50.358 --> 10:51.776
WHICH HAS GIVEN ME ACCESS

10:51.859 --> 10:54.904
TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
AND TUXEDOS.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.740
SO NOW, INSTEAD OF
BEING BROKE AND CRAZY,

10:57.823 --> 10:59.909
I'M RICH AND ECCENTRIC.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.243

SHE'S SO DISTINGUISHED.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.145
SO POISED AND GRACEFUL.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.612

11:36.695 --> 11:39.657

AND DANCE MY WAY
INTO HER HEART.

11:50.876 --> 11:56.173
BUT ALAS, I CAN NEITHER
DANCE NOR SWEEP.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.052

TO DANCE,

12:00.136 --> 12:01.846
IF YOU BOUNCE ME
INTO THIS CLUB.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.973

BOUNCED.
