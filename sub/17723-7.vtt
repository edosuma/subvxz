00:19.119 --> 00:20.786
<i>Dads is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:23.122
Morning.
Morning, gang.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.391
Hump day! Let's do it.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.725
It's Monday.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.794
Yup.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.632
Well, I'm gonna take lunch.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.137
Oh, I had the worst night
last night.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.338
(groans) Me, too.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.507
I was visiting my sick aunt
in the hospital.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.841
Aw.
Yeah.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.810
I was at a play.
(loud groan)

00:44.812 --> 00:47.846
Yeah.
Plays are the worst.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.548
She's been upgraded to critical.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.051
Thanks for asking.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.820
So, the play, was it, uh,
bad Southern accents

00:54.822 --> 00:56.221
or bad British accents?

00:56.223 --> 01:00.025
Southern.
It was <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

01:00.027 --> 01:02.761
Gosh, it's just three hours of
people fake-fanning themselves.

01:02.763 --> 01:07.533
(Southern accent):
I declare it's so hot
on this tin roof..

01:07.535 --> 01:09.368
I can't tell you how many actors

01:09.370 --> 01:10.836
were drinking
from empty glasses.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.004
(Southern accent):
Oh, I'm really thirsty.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.205
I think I'm gonna drink

01:13.207 --> 01:16.175
from this big glass of nothing.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.376
I hate when
they pretend to drive

01:17.378 --> 01:18.544
and just steer way too much.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.879
Like every road is
constantly curvy.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.715
(laughing)

01:23.717 --> 01:25.517
The worst is when they,
when they walk down the aisles

01:25.519 --> 01:27.052
and they act to you.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.221
When I was a kid,
I went and saw <i>Godspell.</i>

01:29.223 --> 01:31.924
Uh, they tried to pull me
on stage and I punched Jesus.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.225
(laughs)

01:33.227 --> 01:35.294
Oh, you know what
else is terrible?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.362
This is a lightning storm.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.764
Oh, no!

01:38.766 --> 01:39.932
Oh, no, the thunder!

01:39.934 --> 01:42.401
You better get
your umbrella!

01:42.403 --> 01:43.569
Oh, my God.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.770
I think I'm gonna stay inside

01:44.772 --> 01:47.439
and just drink
from this big glass of nothing!

01:49.075 --> 01:52.277
Wow!
Did you see that lightning?

01:53.713 --> 01:56.448
I'm gonna call it a day
before the rains come.

01:59.886 --> 02:03.055
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:03.057 --> 02:05.057
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:05.059 --> 02:09.061
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:09.063 --> 02:11.096
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:11.098 --> 02:15.300
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:15.302 --> 02:19.838
¶ So many questions have I

02:19.840 --> 02:21.940
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:21.942 --> 02:24.576
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.682
I had so much fun at
that play last night.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.417
Didn't you?

02:32.419 --> 02:33.619
Yeah, I'm always so happy

02:33.621 --> 02:36.155
when I leave the theater.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.823
You know,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.992
I was thinking I might
audition for a play.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.094
(gasps):
That's a great idea!

02:44.430 --> 02:46.565
You should totally do that.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.434
Honey, honey...

02:49.436 --> 02:51.003
why the sudden need
to be interested in things?

02:51.005 --> 02:54.006
Don't I give you enough money
during the week?

02:54.008 --> 02:57.009
I just... I spend so much time
with housekeeping

02:57.011 --> 02:58.510
and with the kids.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.012
And you're so good at it.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.980
Keep it up.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.683
Warner, I could really use
a creative outlet in my life.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.884
Okay, 80 more dollars a week,

03:05.886 --> 03:08.820
but I can't go
any higher than that.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.056
Ooh, I could just come back
to work with you guys.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.224
No!
No!

03:12.226 --> 03:14.026
I thought so. Thanks, honey.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.594
Yeah, okay, um...

03:20.867 --> 03:22.367
So...

03:22.369 --> 03:24.536
working late...

03:24.538 --> 03:26.538
dinner, just
the two of us.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.340
It's kind of like a date.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.409
(slurping)

03:35.148 --> 03:37.983
Ah!

03:37.985 --> 03:40.219
This is work.
You are paying me to be here.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.287
That's a date in Vegas.

03:44.357 --> 03:47.059
Me hate you long time.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.361
See you tomorrow.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.362
It's a date.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.363
DAVID: Ow!

03:51.365 --> 03:53.031
Ow, ow, ow!
Hey! Hey!

03:53.033 --> 03:55.267
Ow, ow!
Hey, hey! Hey.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.835
What are you two
even doing down here?

03:56.837 --> 03:59.838
He disgusting pig-man.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.173
Come on, guys, come on,
whatever it is,

04:01.175 --> 04:02.341
I'm sure it's not
that a big a deal.

04:02.343 --> 04:05.010
I may have brought bedbugs
into our home.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.378
I will bite you!

04:06.380 --> 04:07.379
Eli!

04:07.381 --> 04:08.714
No, no!

04:08.716 --> 04:09.848
Eli.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.317
He not worth it, man.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.858
How did you even get bedbugs?

04:19.860 --> 04:22.794
Well, it may have happened
when I tried on fur coats

04:22.796 --> 04:25.864
at the thrift shop.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.532
Or when I took a nap

04:27.534 --> 04:30.869
on that couch near the Dumpster.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.304
Or when I was shirtless

04:32.306 --> 04:34.373
on the bus.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.910
Why did you do any
of those things?

04:38.912 --> 04:42.681
I'm a different guy
when I leave the house.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.700
David!

05:02.769 --> 05:04.136
That's my desk.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.406
Well, la-dee-da.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.814
What is going on?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.482
My father brought bedbugs
into our house,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.418
so we have to spend
the week here.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.586
Unless of course you'd like

05:21.588 --> 05:23.955
to have me to sleep
at your place.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.558
Sorry, my lease says "no kids."

05:30.797 --> 05:32.864
(cell phone ringing)

05:36.035 --> 05:37.536
Hi, honey.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.804
Hey, sweetie.
Guess what?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.205
What?

05:40.207 --> 05:41.940
I got the lead
in the play!

05:41.942 --> 05:44.609
(giggling)

05:44.611 --> 05:48.146
Oh, my God.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.815
I knew you'd be so excited.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.616
I need you to thank Eli for me

05:51.618 --> 05:53.652
because I wouldn't have done
this without his encouragement.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.986
Oh, yeah, he's right here.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.188
I-I'll thank him right now.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.255
Eli?

06:12.972 --> 06:16.007
Okay. Thanks for helping
me rehearse, baby.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.076
Yeah, it's the
perfect capper

06:18.078 --> 06:20.979
to a ten-hour workday.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.981
Okay, you play Casper.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.082
Casper.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.219
"A 30-something
headstrong Albanian.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.221
"He gives and takes
guff equally,

06:29.223 --> 06:32.858
making him guff-neutral."

06:32.860 --> 06:35.827
Okay.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.764
"Promise me you won't get mad,
dear Casper."

06:38.766 --> 06:41.500
"I can't promise that any more
than the hawk can promise

06:41.502 --> 06:43.502
the chicken to be true."

06:43.504 --> 06:44.603
(laughing)

06:44.605 --> 06:46.538
Seriously?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.106
Yes, seriously.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.207
Let's keep going, okay?
Okay.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.443
"I parked your scooter

06:51.445 --> 06:54.312
under a tree and got sap on it."

06:56.115 --> 06:58.350
"Don't gasp about past sap.

06:58.352 --> 06:59.851
"And don't grasp my arm

06:59.853 --> 07:02.020
like a rat bastard
pastor, Casper."

07:02.022 --> 07:04.089
Wow, that's gonna be
a tough line to learn.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.223
Yeah.
(quietly): Pastor...

07:05.225 --> 07:07.259
Uh, Camila, you know,
I'd love to do this,

07:07.261 --> 07:09.594
but I got laundry
and I got to make dinner

07:09.596 --> 07:10.929
and I got to reassure
our children

07:10.931 --> 07:13.465
that Mommy still
loves them, okay?
Well...

07:13.467 --> 07:15.200
we just started.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.968
I have to learn all these lines.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.037
I can help you, Camila.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.038
Really?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.039
Mm-hmm.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.774
Were you watching us
silently again?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.709
I've told you several times
to stop doing that.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.946
Well, I was supposed
to be playing golf,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.115
but they kicked me out
after I accidentally

07:30.117 --> 07:32.384
drove a ball
into a child's back.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.453
(chuckles)

07:34.455 --> 07:35.887
Casper, huh?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.490
Uh, by the way,
I'm passing a stone,

07:38.492 --> 07:41.660
so if I start
screaming, duck.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.912
Let me know if
I'm in your way.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.981
No, you're good.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.185
Hey.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.286
Hey.
Hey.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.521
Sorry I'm late.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.624
I was driving my kids
to preschool.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.993
I had to teach myself
how to change a dirty diaper

08:14.995 --> 08:17.062
on the side of the freeway.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.213
Thank you.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.454
Why did we have
to get here so early?

08:42.456 --> 08:46.057
Well, I like to marvel
at the curtain.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.362
That is one
hell of a curtain.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.398
Hey, hey...
that's my armrest!

08:53.400 --> 08:56.401
That's my armrest.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.237
Let's Rock, Paper, Scissor
for it.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.641
In Mexico,
is Donkey, Pistol, Sombrero.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.211
How does that work?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.479
Pistol shoot donkey,

09:07.481 --> 09:09.047
donkey stomp sombrero,

09:09.049 --> 09:11.483
sombrero cover pistol.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.418
All right.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.886
Ready?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.389
<i>Uno, dos, tres. </i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>

09:29.835 --> 09:32.837
Okay, your armrest.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.109
Well, it appears

09:38.111 --> 09:41.580
as though fate has thrown
us together again.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.215
We're a regular
Gnomeo and Juliet.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.384
Oh, ha-ha!

09:46.386 --> 09:47.619
It's only our second date,

09:47.621 --> 09:49.721
and already we sound like
an old married couple.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.022
Hey, don't try and fool me

09:51.024 --> 09:54.659
with the "vagina in the
popcorn trick," okay?

09:57.396 --> 09:59.230
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.066
We have some bad news.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.635
Our lead actor's been
in a serious car accident.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.903
Yes!
(crowd groaning)

10:04.905 --> 10:07.205
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.873
Sorry.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.942
So in the grand tradition
of show business,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.912
tonight's performance
is cancelled.

10:13.914 --> 10:17.115
I'm sorry.
(crowd groans)

10:17.117 --> 10:19.084
Congratulations, honey--
dream achieved!

10:19.086 --> 10:21.920
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.421
Crawford, hey!

10:23.423 --> 10:24.756
You rehearsed with me for hours.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.658
You know all the lines.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.792
Yeah, I do.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.960
I mean, sometimes
it's hard to tell

10:28.962 --> 10:31.997
where I end and Casper begins.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.399
Well, come on!

10:34.401 --> 10:36.134
Yeah, oh, go, go, Crawford.
<i>Andele. Andele.</i>

10:36.136 --> 10:37.302
Crawford, you should
totally do it.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.471
No, no, no, please...
(all encouraging Crawford)

10:39.473 --> 10:40.739
ELI:
Get up on stage!
Dad, Dad, please don't.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.740
Please don't, Dad.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.907
I'll do it.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.777
(applause)

10:48.981 --> 10:50.582
Great!

10:50.584 --> 10:52.851
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

10:52.853 --> 10:55.286
kindly join us
on a magical journey

10:55.288 --> 10:58.757
to 1960's North Dakota!

10:58.759 --> 10:59.858
(blows air)

11:02.795 --> 11:04.696
MAN:
Letters!

11:04.698 --> 11:07.465
Letters!

11:07.467 --> 11:10.035
Letter for you, sir.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.469
Don't. I will punch you.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.506
Ask Jesus.

11:24.383 --> 11:28.720
Sure is quiet out
here on the road.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.023
You know, sometimes
when it's late at night,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.192
I blame myself

11:34.194 --> 11:36.294
for the helicopter crash.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.997
Oh, God.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.066
Why did you take Alfred?

11:41.068 --> 11:44.035
I miss Alfred something fierce.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.739
I have loved you
since you were eight.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.289
What the hell kind
of play is this?

12:08.394 --> 12:11.463
A Thousand Kisses
Before Midnight?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.633
Well, that's one.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.112
So, other than that,
Mrs. Lincoln,

12:27.114 --> 12:29.948
how was the play?

12:32.218 --> 12:34.252
Look at it this way.

12:36.555 --> 12:37.889
What way?

12:37.891 --> 12:39.758
Drunk.

12:41.694 --> 12:42.961
Warner?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.963
Your father,
he give to your wife

12:44.965 --> 12:46.998
the ol' chorizo.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.870
This is not the answer.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.305
Mm-mm.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.374
Hey, guys, let's hear it

12:56.376 --> 12:58.042
for the hottest couple

12:58.044 --> 13:00.378
in show business!
(all cheering)

13:01.647 --> 13:03.314
Thanks, everybody.
Thank you, you guys.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.749
Thanks.
Sorry, I'm so sorry we're late.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.786
I had to stop for
some lip balm.

13:09.321 --> 13:10.488
Yeah, she had kind
of a rough go

13:10.490 --> 13:13.491
with the ol' San Francisco
whisker splitter.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.394
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.662
It means so much to me.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.330
But I just, I really
want to thank

13:19.332 --> 13:21.232
my wonderful husband
for all his support.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.334
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.237
No, no, no-no-no,
no-no-no-no, no.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.606
You kissed my dad.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.608
A thousand times.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.243
(laughing)

13:32.245 --> 13:34.612
It was a play.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.014
It's fake.
Yeah.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.117
He faked his tongue
in your mouth?

13:39.119 --> 13:42.520
Warner, we leave our libidos
in the dressing room.

13:42.522 --> 13:47.158
I doubt I was more
than 30% aroused.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.631
Camila, I... I knew this play
would screw up our lives.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.699
I'm-I'm sorry,

13:54.701 --> 13:57.202
but you have to stop.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.369
What? No, no!

13:58.371 --> 14:00.371
You encouraged me to do this.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.507
I was only pretend encouraging.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.375
I was acting!

14:04.377 --> 14:06.511
Oh, well, I was acting, too.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.980
Oh! Oh, so as long
as it's a play,

14:08.982 --> 14:10.315
we're allowed
to kiss anybody we want?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.449
That's the new rule?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.617
Ladies and gentlemen!

14:12.619 --> 14:14.652
A play called
Kissing Edna

14:14.654 --> 14:15.887
by Warner Whittemore.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.738
How do you like that?

14:33.740 --> 14:36.241
I like it good!

14:46.352 --> 14:48.753
(snoring softly)

14:48.755 --> 14:51.256
Girls suck, huh?

14:53.859 --> 14:55.927
Totally.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.866
Maybe I should
just apologize.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.368
No!

15:03.370 --> 15:05.003
No, no, no, no, no.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.906
Let me tell you, as
a never-married man,

15:07.908 --> 15:09.974
you hold all the cards.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.678
How do you figure?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
Well, because no one
is gonna want to

15:15.682 --> 15:20.018
marry a woman
with three kids.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.386
Okay, we have two kids.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.887
Damn it!
I almost said two.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.522
It's okay.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.623
It's just that,
you know,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.792
ever since my dad
moved in, I...

15:27.794 --> 15:28.960
I feel like my marriage

15:28.962 --> 15:30.628
is just getting
worse and worse.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.030
Hey, hey, hey.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.898
You can't blame your dad
for ruining your life.

15:33.900 --> 15:34.899
Dad,

15:34.901 --> 15:36.901
are you awake?

15:36.903 --> 15:38.970
(snoring)

15:41.307 --> 15:44.075
Our dads are totally
ruining our lives.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.643
It is a nightmare.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.644
Aha!

15:46.646 --> 15:49.213
(both scream)

15:50.983 --> 15:55.320
You fell for the old fake snore.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.588
You do that?

15:57.590 --> 16:00.325
I've been fake snoring
my whole life.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.093
That's how I found out

16:02.095 --> 16:04.162
my platoon was
planning to kill me.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.807
Hey.
Hey.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.008
What are you doing back here?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.476
I'm not staying.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.545
I just forgot my retainer.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.351
Okay, how long are
you going to keep
acting like this?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.419
How long are you going
to keep Frenching my dad?

16:30.322 --> 16:33.191
You know, if you
would have
rehearsed with me,

16:33.193 --> 16:34.993
it would have been
you Frenching me,

16:34.995 --> 16:37.128
but you couldn't
find the time.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.331
What time
do I have?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.101
I-I like the system we
used to have together.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.435
Oh!

16:44.437 --> 16:45.970
The one where
I do everything

16:45.972 --> 16:47.872
and you do nothing?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.107
There you go.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.274
Partners.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.310
Unbelievable.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.114
I've done everything
for five years.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.116
Okay.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.618
Okay, I know about
your naps, all right?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.021
Well, I know about you
parking down the street

17:03.023 --> 17:04.622
and waiting for
the kids' baths to be done

17:04.624 --> 17:05.823
before you come home.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.392
Oh! Great mother!

17:07.394 --> 17:08.693
Looking out
the window

17:08.695 --> 17:09.961
while your kid's
in the tub!

17:09.963 --> 17:11.496
Yeah! Right on!

17:11.498 --> 17:13.631
And what about
this pigsty, huh?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.800
It's like a tornado
came in here.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.335
Right here.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.404
This plate... it's like
I can't find anything!

17:19.406 --> 17:20.905
Okay.

17:20.907 --> 17:21.973
Okay, seriously,

17:21.975 --> 17:23.574
if you can't support me

17:23.576 --> 17:26.144
when I do one thing for myself,

17:26.146 --> 17:28.713
why are we even together?

17:29.715 --> 17:30.982
Tax purposes?

17:30.984 --> 17:32.517
Get out.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.318
Fine, I'm gonna...

17:34.320 --> 17:35.987
take my retainer
and go to the office

17:35.989 --> 17:38.322
and live with my friends.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.225
Say good-bye to the greatest man
you've ever loved.

17:44.696 --> 17:48.466
And never go to the bathroom
without a buddy.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.769
And always carry a flashlight.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.938
If you don't have a flashlight,

17:53.940 --> 17:56.007
you can buy one from my canteen.

17:58.444 --> 18:02.447
I also have candy bars,
$4.00.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.915
Four dollars?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.683
Five.
Five?

18:05.685 --> 18:08.352
Six.
You see how this works?

18:09.788 --> 18:10.955
I'm not hungry.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.257
And remember, the key
to drying your underwear

18:13.259 --> 18:15.093
is keeping them on that vent.

18:15.095 --> 18:18.262
It turns on every half hour.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.998
(whirring)

18:23.302 --> 18:25.770
It's also sort of
become the unofficial flag

18:25.772 --> 18:27.839
of our new office society.

18:29.908 --> 18:32.276
I can't believe
I have to live here.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.478
Are you kidding?

18:33.480 --> 18:34.612
This is a great life.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.613
Sleeping on the floor,

18:35.615 --> 18:37.949
vending machine
dinners.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.251
Hey...

18:40.253 --> 18:41.419
What are you
doing here?

18:41.421 --> 18:42.653
My parents have been staying

18:42.655 --> 18:44.489
in my one-room apartment
with me all week.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.823
Why don't they just
stay in a hotel?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.759
Asian.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.628
Why don't you just
stay in a hotel?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.164
Asian.

18:54.399 --> 18:57.568
Wait, why aren't you guys
at a hotel?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.071
Jewish.
Jewish.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.809
Warner.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.978
Dad, I've got nothing
to say to you.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.680
You know, it seems like
ever since that play,

19:09.682 --> 19:11.749
something is bugging you.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.421
You made out with my wife

19:17.423 --> 19:18.789
in front of everybody I know,

19:18.791 --> 19:20.491
and you keep doing it

19:20.493 --> 19:21.626
every night.

19:21.628 --> 19:25.062
And you've never
thanked me for it.

19:26.632 --> 19:27.832
You know, son, you...

19:27.834 --> 19:30.701
you have got to be more
attentive as a husband.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.304
My marriage didn't work out

19:33.306 --> 19:34.672
because I got in the way

19:34.674 --> 19:36.007
of what your mother wanted.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.508
What did she want?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.044
A divorce.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.480
Do you know
how-how gross it is

19:42.482 --> 19:45.049
to-to see your dad
kissing your wife?

19:45.051 --> 19:47.485
It's a... it's an image
I can't get out of my head.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.121
Okay, how about
this image, then?

19:50.123 --> 19:53.391
Your wife packing her bags
and leaving.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.561
Because that is exactly
what is going to happen

19:56.563 --> 19:58.796
if you don't let her
follow her dreams.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.868
I got to go apologize.
Mm-hmm.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.736
I guess there-there
are worse things

20:05.738 --> 20:08.940
than your dad
kissing your wife.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.742
Warner?
Yeah?

20:11.744 --> 20:14.645
I think I pregnant.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.589
So, how'd it
go at home?

20:24.591 --> 20:26.891
Good.
Things back on
track with Camila?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.059
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.393
Last night, I, uh...

20:29.395 --> 20:34.065
I actually kissed one
of my dad's mustache hairs

20:34.067 --> 20:36.167
out of my wife's mouth.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.836
(coughing)

20:40.505 --> 20:41.839
But I'm...

20:41.841 --> 20:43.908
I'm o... I'm okay.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.778
There's worse places
you could have found it.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.251
So, when are you... when are you
moving back upstairs?

20:53.253 --> 20:56.120
Tonight. Just have a few
loose ends to tie up here.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.189
(sighs)

21:02.094 --> 21:03.327
It's time.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.665
(bugle playing)

21:33.592 --> 21:35.660
(bugle continues playing)

21:37.496 --> 21:40.564
Take your hat off, jerk.
