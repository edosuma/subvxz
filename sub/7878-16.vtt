00:35.559 --> 00:37.127
Nice use of
letter E, Barry.

00:37.135 --> 00:38.569
I like that.

00:38.575 --> 00:40.209
Snot! Get your
head in the game!

00:40.277 --> 00:41.977
This is how we lose
men; good men!

00:42.045 --> 00:43.379
Sorry, Steve.

00:43.447 --> 00:45.948
She's just
so beautiful.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.466
Look at her.

00:47.534 --> 00:50.252
Are you digging for my heart
in there, tadpole?

00:50.320 --> 00:51.787
It's there.

00:51.838 --> 00:54.023
That's where it resides.

00:54.090 --> 00:55.691
Hey, you shouldn't be
worrying about girls

00:55.759 --> 00:56.959
for another ten years.

00:57.027 --> 00:58.294
You should be worrying
about blocks

00:58.361 --> 00:59.829
and making pee-pee
on the potty.

00:59.896 --> 01:01.564
Girls, this guy's
worried about!

01:01.631 --> 01:03.265
You're right,
Steve.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.934
You're always right.

01:05.001 --> 01:07.136
Interesting how
we've developed

01:07.204 --> 01:09.905
such a sophisticated
hierarchy at this young age.

01:09.973 --> 01:10.973
Shut up,
Barry.

01:11.041 --> 01:12.658
I'm at
the bottom.

01:17.814 --> 01:20.316
Snot!
Focus!

01:20.383 --> 01:22.585
I can't take it anymore!

01:22.652 --> 01:24.303
He doesn't treat her right!

01:24.371 --> 01:26.372
Why isn't he grabbing her tush?

01:26.456 --> 01:27.790
Give it a
rest, Snot.

01:27.858 --> 01:29.175
We have to focus
on what to do

01:29.242 --> 01:31.677
for our sixth annual
Best Friends Excursion;

01:31.745 --> 01:33.529
which some people
have misinterpreted

01:33.597 --> 01:34.997
since we printed
shirts that read:

01:35.065 --> 01:37.483
"Hardcore B.F.
Weekend."

01:40.353 --> 01:41.821
Now, as you know,

01:41.888 --> 01:45.173
every year we pool our leftover
baby-sitting and allowance money

01:45.225 --> 01:48.127
and use it to take a trip
together as best pals.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.145
And every year, I come up with

01:50.213 --> 01:51.580
something awesome
for us to do.

01:51.648 --> 01:53.966
Like the time we went
to Dennis Quaid's house.

01:56.636 --> 01:58.320
Do you boys
have any water?

01:58.371 --> 02:01.657
Cause I got some pills
I'd like to get put in me.

02:01.725 --> 02:02.908
Get out of here,
Randy!

02:02.993 --> 02:04.210
You get out of here now!

02:04.294 --> 02:05.411
Get!

02:08.681 --> 02:10.749
That was a
great trip.

02:18.458 --> 02:22.678
Expired. Expired. Expired.

02:22.729 --> 02:24.380
Should we just have a baby?

02:24.447 --> 02:26.448
I guess.

02:27.851 --> 02:30.719
I am here for the fair Hayley!

02:30.787 --> 02:32.254
Oh, God.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.691
Hayley, I love you!

02:35.759 --> 02:37.326
Oh, God.

02:37.394 --> 02:40.512
And I'm not leaving until
you say you love me back.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.348
No. I don't love you, okay?

02:42.415 --> 02:43.999
I'm married. Sometimes happily.

02:45.485 --> 02:46.952
I thought you might say that.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.705
But wait till you hear this!

02:50.907 --> 02:53.742
Aha! I hired a
12-piece orchestra

02:53.810 --> 02:55.511
to play your favorite song,

02:55.579 --> 02:58.430
"Gangsta's Paradise" by Coolio.

02:58.498 --> 03:03.719
♪ ♪

03:03.787 --> 03:06.021
Now what do you say?

03:06.089 --> 03:07.222
No.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.024
I thought
you might say that.

03:09.092 --> 03:12.294
But feast your eyes
on this!

03:14.214 --> 03:15.798
Aha-ha!

03:15.865 --> 03:16.949
Elephant.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.367
Your favorite animal.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.035
I rented it for you.

03:20.103 --> 03:21.937
Say you love me!
No.

03:22.005 --> 03:24.640
I thought
you might say that.

03:24.708 --> 03:28.644
But wait until you see
what's in the elephant's sack.

03:28.712 --> 03:30.546
Aha-ha!

03:30.614 --> 03:32.214
Batteries!

03:32.282 --> 03:33.849
Your favorite thing

03:33.917 --> 03:35.918
on your favorite animal!

03:35.986 --> 03:36.986
No.

03:37.053 --> 03:38.654
I thought you might say that.

03:38.722 --> 03:41.457
But wait until you see this!

03:47.247 --> 03:49.615
Aha-ha!

03:49.683 --> 03:51.934
What do you say now, my love?

03:52.002 --> 03:53.836
Go... away.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.672 --> 04:14.506
Snot, it's okay.

04:14.574 --> 04:16.942
You tried,
huh, big guy?

04:17.010 --> 04:19.244
No. It's not okay.

04:19.312 --> 04:22.598
It's never gonna be okay!

04:24.734 --> 04:26.101
If it makes you feel any better,

04:26.169 --> 04:28.270
I'm pretty sure
she has the herps.

04:28.338 --> 04:30.673
Yeah,
she does.

04:33.343 --> 04:36.745
Sam, you didn't turn Larry Tate
into a horse did you?

04:36.813 --> 04:38.947
Well...

04:42.886 --> 04:45.821
How great is <i>Bewitched?</i>

04:45.889 --> 04:48.090
I wish we lived
in the '60s.

04:48.158 --> 04:51.427
Men wore suits and drank
martinis all day long.

04:51.494 --> 04:52.795
Francine,
starting tomorrow,

04:52.862 --> 04:54.763
I want you to greet me at
the door with a martini

04:54.831 --> 04:55.831
when I get home from work.

04:55.899 --> 04:58.500
Stan, martinis
are pretty strong,

04:58.568 --> 05:00.669
and you're not much of a drinker.
What?!

05:00.737 --> 05:02.671
Just last week
at Sanders' barbecue,

05:02.739 --> 05:05.974
I poured a whole amber lager
down my mighty throat

05:06.042 --> 05:08.444
in just under two hours.

05:08.511 --> 05:11.413
All right. I guess
it does sound kind of fun.

05:11.481 --> 05:14.382
Oh! I <i>Dream of Jeannie</i>
is on next.

05:14.434 --> 05:15.968
Know what else
sounds fun?

05:16.036 --> 05:18.137
You start wearing see-through
pants and living in a bottle.

05:18.204 --> 05:20.139
The CIA has a great shrink ray.

05:20.206 --> 05:23.325
I'd carry tiny you around
and feed you grains of rice.

05:24.878 --> 05:27.413
Come on, do it.

05:30.116 --> 05:31.850
Snot, just pick up.

05:31.918 --> 05:34.903
I'm sorry Hayley rejected you,
but look at it this way:

05:34.971 --> 05:36.905
now that you've spent
all your bar mitzvah money

05:36.973 --> 05:38.941
trying to get her, you don't
have to worry about your mom

05:39.008 --> 05:40.809
stealing it out of
your account anymore.

05:42.212 --> 05:44.213
I am stressing out, Steve!

05:44.264 --> 05:45.631
My company just announced

05:45.698 --> 05:47.633
they're no longer
matching our 401Ks.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.768
My doctor gave me
a promotional stress ball,

05:49.836 --> 05:51.954
as if fidgeting
with some dumb ball

05:52.021 --> 05:53.956
will take the weight
of the world off my shoulders.

05:54.023 --> 05:55.107
Actually, it's helping a lot.

05:55.191 --> 05:56.591
Whatever, Roger.

05:56.643 --> 05:58.994
Snot just got his heart broken,
and I have to cheer him up.

05:59.062 --> 06:02.281
Hey... actually,
maybe you could help!

06:02.365 --> 06:05.084
You know, uh, put-put together
a teenage girl disguise.

06:05.151 --> 06:08.403
Laugh at his jokes, smile,
twirl your hair a little.

06:08.471 --> 06:09.838
Build his confidence.

06:09.906 --> 06:12.307
No, no. I can't just switch
personas like that.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.876
See, sometimes
certain characters

06:13.943 --> 06:15.444
just grab ahold of you,

06:15.512 --> 06:18.747
and, brother, they set up shop
in the depths of your soul.

06:18.815 --> 06:20.448
You get to go to Forever 21.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.235
Cigarette jeans!

06:31.995 --> 06:35.798
You gonna play that game
or just lean on it?

06:35.865 --> 06:36.865
Name's Jenny.

06:36.933 --> 06:38.433
Jenny Fr mdabloc.

06:38.501 --> 06:40.569
I'm Steve's cousin
visiting from Jersey.

06:40.637 --> 06:43.071
Yes! Y-Yes,
she is.

06:43.139 --> 06:44.323
I-I didn't mention
it because...

06:44.407 --> 06:45.724
No one's doing the math.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.459
Your hair,
it's curly.

06:47.527 --> 06:49.761
You should see it when
I wash it on Tuesdays.

06:49.829 --> 06:53.198
You're funny.

06:53.266 --> 06:56.168
Come on, boys. Let's give
these two a little space.

06:57.737 --> 07:00.205
So... buy me
a soda pop?

07:00.273 --> 07:03.041
I've only got enough
money for one Coke.

07:03.109 --> 07:05.310
Oh, that's so sweet.
We'll share.

07:05.378 --> 07:07.412
Or I'll just have it.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.519
So, basically, we all eat seven
spiders a year in our sleep.

07:15.255 --> 07:16.755
Snot? Are you okay?

07:16.823 --> 07:18.624
I almost didn't make it
to school.

07:18.691 --> 07:20.492
Oh, no, Jenny.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.627
What did she do?

07:21.694 --> 07:23.162
Oh, Steve!

07:23.229 --> 07:26.031
We went to Taco King, and
then we rode the Ferris wheel,

07:26.099 --> 07:29.134
then we went to the beach
and stayed up all night

07:29.202 --> 07:31.270
talking about our hopes
and dreams.

07:31.337 --> 07:33.305
Then I her!

07:33.373 --> 07:35.457
I finally did it, man.

07:35.525 --> 07:37.692
I'm not a virgin anymore.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.525
You slut!

07:57.593 --> 08:00.161
I have to say,
it was super relaxing

08:00.229 --> 08:02.113
being an innocent young girl
for a change.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.949
Innocent?! You did it
with Snot on the beach!

08:05.017 --> 08:06.100
Yeah, I did.

08:06.168 --> 08:08.052
Got sand all up
in my Jenny dress,

08:08.137 --> 08:09.637
not to mention my gopher hole.

08:09.705 --> 08:11.139
Oop, I mentioned it.

08:11.206 --> 08:14.208
You're an alien! How is that
even physically possible?!

08:14.276 --> 08:15.943
Well, you see, Steve,
just because I don't have

08:16.011 --> 08:18.045
your traditional
human genitalia...

08:18.113 --> 08:19.680
Nah... no!
My ears!

08:19.748 --> 08:21.682
I'm sorry I ever asked
you for this favor.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.201
I should've known
you'd take it too far.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.669
Yeah, you should've.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.938
You've known me for years,
Steve.

08:29.174 --> 08:31.859
So, you know, once you've
been intimate with a lady,

08:31.927 --> 08:33.227
you start to see it
everywhere.

08:33.294 --> 08:36.114
Like in the sideways mouth
of a bearded man...

08:36.181 --> 08:37.881
Ohhh...

08:39.150 --> 08:42.086
Hey, guys, so I
had a few pitches

08:42.154 --> 08:43.788
for our annual friends excursion.
I was thinking...

08:45.290 --> 08:46.791
And boobies!

08:46.859 --> 08:49.694
You know how desk lamps have
those little nubs at the top?

08:50.863 --> 08:52.046
If you turn that,

08:52.097 --> 08:54.182
you can have more light
to see the boobies.

09:06.311 --> 09:07.462
Oh, Steve.
You're home.

09:07.529 --> 09:10.932
I made bologna roll-ups
for Snot and your...

09:10.999 --> 09:12.233
cousin?
Mm, cousin.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.534
Cousin.

09:14.703 --> 09:16.187
You can have these, Steve.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.955
We have roll-ups of our own.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.925
Mmm...

09:21.009 --> 09:22.109
Yuck!

09:22.177 --> 09:23.795
Oh, hello, Hayley.

09:23.862 --> 09:26.631
I'm here visiting
my <i>girlfriend.</i>

09:26.698 --> 09:28.833
Ew.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.234
She's jealous.

09:30.302 --> 09:33.421
You're so classy.
Mmm...

09:33.489 --> 09:35.890
Um, what is going on here,
<i>Jenny?</i>

09:35.958 --> 09:38.726
I'll tell you what's going
on here: I like Snot.

09:38.794 --> 09:40.928
He's cute and he's funny
and he treats me nice.

09:40.996 --> 09:43.414
Reminds me of a
young Paul Reiser.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.766
He is <i>nothing</i> like
a young Paul Reiser.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.352
He's Rob Morrow,
on his best day.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.738
Listen, Jenny, I should
probably get home anyway.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.156
No... don't go.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.424
Mm... I don't
want to go.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.692
Then stay.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.577
I wish I could
stay forever.

09:56.645 --> 09:58.863
Promise me you'll visit
my dreams tonight.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.231
Oh, come on!

10:02.450 --> 10:04.485
Honey, I'm home!

10:04.553 --> 10:06.120
Hi, dear.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.722
Martini?
Perfect.

10:07.789 --> 10:09.473
Just like Darrin and Sam.

10:09.558 --> 10:11.225
So elegant.

10:11.293 --> 10:12.894
Cheers... darling.

10:17.349 --> 10:19.717
Stan, get in the car!

10:19.785 --> 10:23.855
Hada baga! Hada ba-gaga!

10:23.939 --> 10:26.107
Clearly you can't
handle your gin!

10:26.158 --> 10:27.992
Now get in, damn it!

10:28.076 --> 10:28.976
Vault!

10:30.495 --> 10:32.697
You see that, Harold?

10:32.764 --> 10:36.234
That man tried to put his
package into that mailbox.

10:36.301 --> 10:40.037
Maybe he
thought it was a female box.

10:41.456 --> 10:44.091
A fe... a female box...

10:44.159 --> 10:45.376
Oy.

10:49.665 --> 10:53.267
It's been nine years
since Judy died.

10:58.607 --> 11:00.308
It's sort of
weird, huh,

11:00.375 --> 11:01.909
hanging out at
your house, Snot?

11:01.977 --> 11:04.111
I mean, we-we usually
hang out at my place.

11:04.179 --> 11:07.281
Yeah. Stuff happens at other
people's houses, too, Steve.

11:07.349 --> 11:10.751
Don't go in there, huh?

11:10.819 --> 11:12.570
What are we watching?

11:14.856 --> 11:17.291
Well, Jenny, I think
you're watching us decide

11:17.359 --> 11:19.293
what we're gonna do for
our friends excursion.

11:19.361 --> 11:20.728
Okay, ready?

11:20.796 --> 11:24.131
You know how Baskin-Robbins
has 31 flavors?

11:24.199 --> 11:27.168
Get this: We try
every single flavor...

11:27.235 --> 11:30.171
in one day. Huh?

11:30.238 --> 11:31.639
Hmm...

11:31.707 --> 11:34.942
I was thinking we'd go
to Wild West Land.

11:35.010 --> 11:36.227
Yeah!
Yeah!

11:36.295 --> 11:39.263
And remember, boys,
there will be girls aplenty

11:39.331 --> 11:41.065
at Wild West Land.

11:41.133 --> 11:44.468
Take it from someone who's
getting sniz on the reg.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.405
Come on. 31 Flavors is
a much better idea

11:47.472 --> 11:49.040
than Wild West Land.

11:49.107 --> 11:51.275
Hey, whatcha thinkin'?

11:51.343 --> 11:54.211
I don't want to
tell in front of these guys.

11:54.279 --> 11:55.746
You want to tell me
over there?

11:55.814 --> 11:56.814
Yeah.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.283
Okay, let's go.
Okay.

12:00.902 --> 12:03.738
Hey, what are we
supposed to do?

12:03.805 --> 12:04.772
Well, I guess
we could...

12:04.840 --> 12:06.140
Not you, virgin!

12:13.715 --> 12:15.733
Do you know
what time it is?

12:15.801 --> 12:17.652
Nope. We were having
sex in the park,

12:17.719 --> 12:18.869
and I totally lost track.

12:18.937 --> 12:20.738
I must have been
making weird noises

12:20.806 --> 12:23.007
'cause a bunch of cats
wouldn't leave us alone.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.109
Had to throw
a couple cats.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.078
Roger, you have to stop this.

12:27.145 --> 12:28.045
I see.

12:28.072 --> 12:29.790
I know what's really
going on here.

12:29.857 --> 12:31.158
You can't stand
the fact

12:31.225 --> 12:32.442
that Snot's cool now,

12:32.510 --> 12:34.594
and you're no longer
king of the nerds!

12:34.662 --> 12:36.596
That's ridiculous!

12:36.664 --> 12:39.716
I mean sure there's been
an established hierarchy, but...

12:39.784 --> 12:41.485
What...
wh-what is that?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.487
Oh, this?
My stress ball.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.721
But there's
a crack in it.

12:44.789 --> 12:47.240
Uh-huh.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.076
Oh, my God, that's how
you and Snot have been...

12:50.144 --> 12:51.178
Relieving stress.

12:51.245 --> 12:52.813
Because this is
a stress ball.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.581
And trust me,
Snot's been relieving

12:54.649 --> 12:57.217
a lot of stress into
this thing.

12:57.285 --> 12:58.552
Good night!

13:09.597 --> 13:12.449
They went to Wild West Land
without me?

13:12.517 --> 13:14.400
Hey, Steve, I'm just
telling a few people,

13:14.452 --> 13:16.753
I'm making belt buckles now
if you want to buy one.

13:16.821 --> 13:17.687
Check it out.

13:19.957 --> 13:22.392
He's got red eyes
from smoking weed.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.995
I really can't believe
you're an educator, Brian.

13:25.062 --> 13:27.380
My job's mostly
administrative.

13:32.453 --> 13:33.870
Traitors!

13:33.938 --> 13:35.739
Last I checked,
friends excursions

13:35.807 --> 13:37.474
included <i>all</i>
of the friends.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.109
How could you come here
without me?

13:39.177 --> 13:40.677
Because you
hate Jenny,

13:40.745 --> 13:43.747
and you're jealous that I'm
getting sniz on the reg.

13:43.815 --> 13:45.348
Stop saying that!

13:45.416 --> 13:47.250
Sorry, Steve.
Snot's cooler.

13:47.318 --> 13:49.019
Okay, okay.

13:49.086 --> 13:50.720
Hey, Snot, heads up.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.738
What's this?

13:51.806 --> 13:52.772
A stress ball.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.609
Feel familiar?

13:55.676 --> 13:58.812
This is what Jenny was using
to fake sex with you.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.247
What?!

14:00.314 --> 14:02.082
She didn't do it with you
for real.

14:02.149 --> 14:03.616
You're still a virgin!

14:03.668 --> 14:05.185
Ohhh...

14:07.021 --> 14:09.256
Jenny, how could you?

14:09.323 --> 14:11.808
I'm sorry!

14:11.876 --> 14:13.410
You made a fool
out of me!

14:13.477 --> 14:16.462
I never want
to see you again.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.838
I need this now more than ever
for its intended purpose!

14:24.906 --> 14:27.007
<i>"Sons of Tucson,</i>
new on Fox"?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.208
When was this on?

14:28.276 --> 14:29.642
I watch Fox;
I never saw this.

14:41.270 --> 14:42.471
Please.

14:42.496 --> 14:43.679
Fine! Just go.

14:43.747 --> 14:46.599
Just-just ruin
two lives and go!

14:46.666 --> 14:48.234
Roger, I didn't
ruin your life.

14:48.301 --> 14:49.602
Jenny's not even real.

14:49.669 --> 14:51.771
But our love was!

14:51.838 --> 14:53.005
Snot loved Jenny

14:53.073 --> 14:54.540
and Jenny loved Snot.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.108
Ew.

15:00.547 --> 15:05.451
So, guys, let's hit
31 Flavors this weekend.

15:05.519 --> 15:07.069
What do you say, Snot?

15:07.137 --> 15:08.938
I'm thinking
of moving to Cheyenne

15:09.005 --> 15:11.006
to live with my uncle Pat.

15:11.091 --> 15:14.860
Look, I know you're upset,
but you had to know the truth.

15:14.928 --> 15:17.196
Trust me, it's best
for the group.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.265
You're right, Steve.

15:19.332 --> 15:20.599
You're always right.

15:24.604 --> 15:25.988
Again, just
want to mention

15:26.056 --> 15:27.857
I'm selling belt
buckles I made.

15:27.924 --> 15:30.876
I also got a line
of retro ones.

15:33.663 --> 15:35.965
Yep, that was the time.

15:36.032 --> 15:38.067
That was the music
of the time.

15:38.135 --> 15:39.902
The drug of the time?

15:39.970 --> 15:41.454
"Kyo-kyaine."

15:46.226 --> 15:48.561
Hey, where's my martini?

15:48.628 --> 15:50.029
You're not getting one.

15:50.096 --> 15:51.814
You can't handle your alcohol.

15:51.882 --> 15:53.382
Of course, I can.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.835
Yesterday I just had to
get the kinks worked out.

15:55.902 --> 15:57.169
Tonight I'm ready to live

15:57.237 --> 15:58.471
like a gentleman
of the '60s.

15:58.538 --> 16:00.623
Now, martini me, sweetheart.

16:00.690 --> 16:04.109
I tell you I was
in the best shape of my life.

16:04.177 --> 16:06.545
I was closer to God
than I've ever been,

16:06.613 --> 16:09.465
and I was flush
with cash.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.433
Stan, I really don't
want to talk

16:11.501 --> 16:12.768
about the fifth
grade anymore.

16:12.836 --> 16:14.036
Fine.

16:17.858 --> 16:19.758
How, how did you...?

16:19.826 --> 16:21.410
How did you do that?

16:21.478 --> 16:23.312
Do what?

16:23.380 --> 16:25.815
You passed out, and I
went and got you water.

16:25.882 --> 16:27.032
I barely blinked!

16:27.100 --> 16:28.884
And things then all changed

16:28.952 --> 16:30.352
like on <i>Bewitched.</i>

16:35.225 --> 16:37.493
Where did you get
that broom?

16:37.561 --> 16:41.063
Did you ride that broom
into the living room

16:41.131 --> 16:43.866
because you're a witch?!

16:54.561 --> 16:56.946
I'm married to a witch!

17:12.395 --> 17:16.147
<i>It's time you knew the truth.</i>

17:19.752 --> 17:22.788
Your father won't be
joining us for dinner.

17:22.856 --> 17:25.723
I'm sorry our horse-for-two
costume freaked him out, Mrs. S.

17:25.791 --> 17:28.193
Just bad timing, Jeff.

17:28.261 --> 17:29.361
It's a sex thing.

17:29.429 --> 17:30.846
I know, Jeff.

17:35.785 --> 17:36.986
Hey, Roger.

17:38.121 --> 17:40.890
Snot made me this.

17:40.957 --> 17:43.492
He made it out
of his Spanish worksheet.

17:45.695 --> 17:47.413
You really liked
him, didn't you?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.647
I did, I did.

17:48.698 --> 17:49.915
He was just really sweet.

17:49.983 --> 17:51.283
Roger, I'm sorry.

17:51.351 --> 17:53.869
I guess I did want
to be king of the nerds.

17:53.937 --> 17:56.605
But I'd rather have Snot happy
than be king of anything.

17:56.673 --> 17:58.607
I want Snot happy,
too, Steve.

17:58.675 --> 18:00.142
But it's too late now.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.493
Snot won't take me back

18:01.561 --> 18:03.796
after you revealed Jenny
was faking it with him.

18:03.863 --> 18:06.315
True, but I think
I just found a way

18:06.383 --> 18:08.517
for you to make him feel
like a man again.

18:08.585 --> 18:12.021
Ooh, how about you fill me in
over a couple of beers?

18:12.088 --> 18:13.355
Great, right?

18:13.423 --> 18:16.091
I had two party balls
implanted in my chest.

18:16.159 --> 18:17.593
One light beer,
one regular.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.694
Comin' at ya!

18:18.778 --> 18:20.679
Ahh! Stop it!

18:21.948 --> 18:22.865
Squirt.
No!

18:22.949 --> 18:24.316
Hey, stop it!
Squirt.

18:24.367 --> 18:25.651
Quit it!
Squirt, squirt.

18:25.702 --> 18:27.336
Aah! Squirt, squirt. Quit it!

18:33.376 --> 18:35.144
It's no good, Steve.

18:35.211 --> 18:37.313
Nothing's gonna cheer me up.

18:37.380 --> 18:40.182
You gonna use that street
lamp or just lean on it?

18:40.250 --> 18:41.700
You!

18:41.768 --> 18:43.168
Snot, please
hear me out.

18:43.236 --> 18:45.321
Yes, I tricked you
with a stress ball,

18:45.388 --> 18:47.306
and it was a rotten
thing to do.

18:47.374 --> 18:48.974
Extra rotten,
if you ask me!

18:49.042 --> 18:50.209
I know.

18:50.276 --> 18:52.094
But I did it because
I was saving myself

18:52.162 --> 18:53.395
for someone I loved.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.065
And I've realized that
that someone is you.

18:56.132 --> 18:58.767
I want to do it
for real tonight.

18:58.835 --> 18:59.802
What do you say?

18:59.869 --> 19:01.637
Make love to me again?

19:01.705 --> 19:04.073
For the first time?

19:10.313 --> 19:11.981
Come here, you!

19:14.701 --> 19:17.152
Wow, Snot, you're the man again.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.289
Until tonight, my love.

19:23.610 --> 19:25.344
Noooo...!

19:29.416 --> 19:32.017
She loved you, man.

19:32.085 --> 19:34.903
She loved you and you were
about to have sex with her.

19:34.971 --> 19:36.889
That's closer than any of us
have ever gotten.

19:36.956 --> 19:39.024
Yeah.

19:39.092 --> 19:41.160
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

19:41.227 --> 19:43.912
So, Steve, what
should we do now?

19:43.980 --> 19:47.216
What do <i>you</i> feel
like doing, big guy?

19:49.352 --> 19:51.320
Maybe we should go
to 31 Flavors.

19:51.388 --> 19:53.989
That sounds great.

19:54.057 --> 19:55.891
You know, things
aren't so bad.

19:55.959 --> 19:57.993
I've got good friends,
and I realized

19:58.061 --> 20:01.080
I can get over the death of a
girlfriend really quickly.

20:04.034 --> 20:05.367
What are you doing here?

20:05.435 --> 20:07.036
Come to pay respects

20:07.103 --> 20:08.837
to one of my best
characters ever.

20:08.905 --> 20:10.239
How'd you fake
her death, anyway?

20:10.306 --> 20:11.373
Oh, that was easy.

20:14.194 --> 20:15.677
Until tonight,
my love.

20:17.347 --> 20:19.431
<i>I can move really, really fast.</i>

20:53.249 --> 20:55.317
Noooo...!

20:56.519 --> 20:58.287
You sure can.

20:58.354 --> 20:59.321
I can.

20:59.389 --> 21:01.590
My underwear!

21:01.658 --> 21:03.292
Can I have those back?

21:03.359 --> 21:06.028
No. I already sold them
to that guy.
