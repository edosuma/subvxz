WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:04.770
My mother worked
for the CIA.

00:04.772 --> 00:05.738
(laughs)

00:08.376 --> 00:09.541
Forgive me.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.244
Pavel Volkoff,
my protégé.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.412
<i> He's a good man.</i>

00:13.414 --> 00:15.080
Can you help us?

00:15.082 --> 00:16.582
There's a "man of interest"
to us in Los Angeles.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.484
What's this man's name?

00:18.486 --> 00:19.785
Artem Fedor.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.720
Artem Fedor?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.526
(groaning)

00:27.528 --> 00:29.128
You had a sister.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.913
What happened to her?

00:30.914 --> 00:32.697
We used to sneak out,
down to the river.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.333
It swept her away.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.168
And she was buried
with my name...

00:36.170 --> 00:38.070
<i> Hannah Lawson.</i>

00:38.072 --> 00:39.405
Do you know who I am?
I think so.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.607
The reasons matter.
To me, they matter.

00:41.609 --> 00:45.644
Then I will tell it to you all
another time, everything.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.450
Here you are.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.585
Thank you, Jason.
You're welcome.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.155
I thought you were
quitting, Mary.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.957
Last pack, I promise.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.758
I'm pretty sure that's what
you said about the last one.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.193
And the one before that.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.562
And the one before that, yes.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.631
Don't you have any other
customers to take care of?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.566
Well, yeah, I do,
but you're my favorite.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.501
(chuckles)

01:09.503 --> 01:12.471
Hey, spare some
change, lady?

01:14.542 --> 01:17.443
Yes, I think I have
a few quarters.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.577
Quarters? I look like
a parking meter?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.746
Come on, give me cash.
Oh!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.347
Hey, hey, hey!
Get out of here, man.
What?

01:22.349 --> 01:23.615
Leave her alone.
What are you doing? Stop.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.650
I wanted to...
Just want...
No. What are you...

01:24.652 --> 01:25.851
Leave her alone, man.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.253
Come on, come on.
Just get moving.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.523
I'm sorry, Mary.
Are you okay?
Oh...

01:31.525 --> 01:35.127
Yes, thank you, Jason.
Thank you.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.395
Well, don't worry
about the bill, okay?

01:36.397 --> 01:38.564
It's on the house.
Okay.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.699
(sighs)

02:02.523 --> 02:04.723
¶ ¶

02:19.673 --> 02:21.206
(Kensi chuckles)

02:21.208 --> 02:22.307
Just promise me that
you're gonna restrain

02:22.309 --> 02:24.143
yourself this year,
okay, that's all.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.512
Restrain myself-- what
are you talking about?

02:26.514 --> 02:29.248
Last Thanksgiving,
you cooked three turkeys,

02:29.250 --> 02:31.350
ha-half a ton
of mashed potatoes,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.418
(laughing)
and enough gravy
to drown a horse.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.921
I was in a tryptophan coma
for two days.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.624
It wasn't the tryptophan.
It was a hangover.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.392
Ooh.
Mm-hmm.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.896
Hey, you care to join me
for Thanksgiving?

02:43.898 --> 02:45.931
It looks like I may
have an opening.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.299
Now you're trying to replace me?
I would love to,

02:47.301 --> 02:49.401
but my mom
and Mrs. Deeks will be

02:49.403 --> 02:50.602
cooking Thanksgiving dinner,

02:50.604 --> 02:51.737
so it's just the four of us.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.172
Fun.
Just the four of you?

02:53.174 --> 02:54.673
That sounds nice.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.275
Please, you couldn't
do Thanksgiving without me.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.311
I'm family.
I'm Uncle Callen.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.646
Yeah, well, you keep
complaining about the food,

03:00.648 --> 03:03.282
and Uncle Callen's gonna
get drowned in that gravy.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.950
(Kensi laughing)

03:04.952 --> 03:08.887
I miss this, you guys.
I really miss this.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.923
You'll be back in no time.
just keep at it.
Yeah.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.742
Speaking of which,

03:12.743 --> 03:14.560
I should get back to my first
torture session of the day.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.827
Who you torturing today?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.430
Oh, ho, ho, wow.
That's the best you got?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.898
I'm off my game.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.233
We need you back.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.535
Damn right you do.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.337
All right.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.538
Stay safe.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.640
See you boys later.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.915
Morning, fellas.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.250
Morning.
Good morning.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.220
So do either of you
recognize this guy?

03:41.222 --> 03:42.421
Artem Fedor.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.989
The man, the mystery.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.525
Our Russian contact,
Pavel Volkoff, had us

03:46.527 --> 03:47.859
apprehend him here in L.A.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.428
SAM: In turn,
he helped us break

03:49.430 --> 03:50.762
Arkady out of
prison in Russia,

03:50.764 --> 03:52.464
but that was months ago.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.532
Well, Fedor's
finally talking and

03:53.534 --> 03:54.866
he's got one hell of a story.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.603
In exchange for transfer
to minimum security,

03:57.605 --> 04:00.973
Fedor claims he has information
on an assassination.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.958
Meet Mary Reynolds.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.942
She's a retired dialect coach
from Studio City.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.663
CALLEN:
Dialect coach?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.382
Not your typical target
for an assassin.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.451
Fedor thinks someone
wants to kill this woman?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.419
Oh, according to him,
someone already has.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.255
Mary Reynolds has been
at St. Anne's Hospital

04:16.257 --> 04:18.824
for the past four days
with a mysterious ailment.

04:18.826 --> 04:22.294
As we speak, her blood's being
tested for poisons.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.396
So how do we figure into this?

04:24.398 --> 04:25.998
Granger wants you to talk to
Mary, see if she knows anything.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.968
Granger doesn't want us
interrogating Fedor?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.270
Actually, Deeks and Eric are
already there.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.272
I'm sorry, Eric?

04:33.274 --> 04:35.374
Because he's the one
who took Fedor down,

04:35.376 --> 04:37.042
he claims to have
a unique insight

04:37.044 --> 04:38.977
into what makes him tick.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.412
He three a flash ring
at the guy.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.947
He didn't do a psych profile.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.382
Oh, but he did.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.651
And it's 17 pages long.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.420
I think by page five,
Granger just wanted him

04:48.422 --> 04:50.322
to get out of here.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.357
Well, Fedor's in prison.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.059
How much trouble
can Eric get into?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.527
Mr. Fedor, Artem.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.397
Do you mind if
I call you Artem?

04:58.399 --> 05:01.333
I'm, uh, Detective Deeks,
LAPD, and this is, um...

05:01.335 --> 05:03.602
I think he knows who I am.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.404
Who is he?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.471
ERIC: Wise guy, huh?

05:06.473 --> 05:09.708
Maybe this will jog your memory.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.810
Whoa!
Is that a grenade?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.412
All right, come on.
Excuse me for a second.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.446
What are you doing, man?

05:14.447 --> 05:15.479
How did you even
get this in here?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.382
Wait, no, no,
it's fake, see?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.484
Jelly beans.
Okay.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.720
I don't care, you don't
bring a grenade,

05:21.722 --> 05:23.422
real or fake, into
an interrogation.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.441
What is wrong with you?

05:25.442 --> 05:27.459
My psych profile says
Fedor responds well

05:27.461 --> 05:29.027
to intimidation.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.594
We don't need to intimidate him.
You want to know why, Beale?

05:30.597 --> 05:32.431
Why?
Because he's cooperating.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.466
He called us, remember?

05:40.074 --> 05:42.107
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.543
Guess I kind of built
this moment up in my head

05:44.545 --> 05:45.811
for a long time.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.446
Just got a little...
Crazy.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.747
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.949
Sorry.
Sorry, Fedor.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.786
It was a joke, okay?
I remember you.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.888
For reals?
Yeah.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.090
I guess it's true
what they say, huh?

05:58.092 --> 05:59.591
Game recognizes game.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.959
Uh, jelly bean?
Stop that.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.861
Okay.
So, um,

06:02.863 --> 06:05.864
now that we've hit reset
and we're all besties,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.499
tell me about
Mary Reynolds.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.500
Why would someone
want to target her?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.469
ERIC: Yeah.
I don't know.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.537
Okay, come on, Artem.
if you want that transfer,

06:12.539 --> 06:13.672
we're gonna need
more than that.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.140
A lot more.
Beale!

06:15.142 --> 06:16.875
Sorry.
Listen.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.178
All I do know is
I was hired

06:19.179 --> 06:21.480
by someone in the Russian FSB--
the secret service--

06:21.482 --> 06:24.716
to find a woman
names Katerina Polunin.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.652
Now, I discovered she goes
by the name of Mary Reynolds,

06:27.654 --> 06:29.054
but before I could
track her down,

06:29.056 --> 06:30.589
you shot me.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.524
Stop pacing.

06:34.128 --> 06:37.796
You've been in prison
since February,

06:37.798 --> 06:40.165
so how did you know
she was targeted?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.500
I received
a phone call yesterday.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.702
They said my job
had been canceled.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.171
Katerina had been
neutralized.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.839
That's all they said.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.758
I don't know who
this woman is,

06:49.759 --> 06:51.676
but there are some very
powerful people in the FSB

06:51.678 --> 06:52.911
looking for her.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.546
That's interesting.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.448
CALLEN:
I'll call Sam.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.750
I don't understand.
My mother's name came up

06:58.752 --> 06:59.818
in some investigation?

06:59.820 --> 07:00.886
What does that mean?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.621
Well, we're not
exactly sure yet.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.456
Has she been able to speak?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.691
We'd like to ask her
a few questions

07:06.693 --> 07:09.094
Oh, you can try, but

07:09.096 --> 07:11.430
she's been so weak, sometimes
she doesn't even recognize me.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.931
Alexandra...

07:12.933 --> 07:15.634
Please, call me Alex.
Alex...

07:15.636 --> 07:19.504
Your mother, was she born
in the United States?

07:19.506 --> 07:21.440
Yeah, she was born
here in Los Angeles.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.974
Don't you guys
have databases

07:22.976 --> 07:25.177
for that information?

07:25.179 --> 07:27.979
Just double-checking.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.981
You notice anything
out of the ordinary recently?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.850
Had she been
acting differently?

07:31.852 --> 07:33.552
Uh...
(exhales)

07:33.554 --> 07:36.888
Well, besides the fact
that we're talking again, no.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.825
We, uh, had a falling out
years ago.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.827
This was gonna be our first

07:41.829 --> 07:43.929
Thanksgiving in years.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.031
Oh, damn it!

07:46.033 --> 07:47.466
I got to go.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.900
I'm working a lunch shift today.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.604
Hey, uh, I'll be
back later, okay, Mom?

07:52.606 --> 07:56.007
I'll bring you a slice
of cherry pie, huh?

07:57.544 --> 08:00.045
It's her favorite.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.013
Uh, excuse me.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.586
WOMAN (over p.a.):
Dr. Reuben, extension 2219.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.255
Dr. Reuben,
extension 2219.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.091
Mary.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.060
Mary, can you hear me?

08:20.567 --> 08:22.901
(speaking Russian):
Katerina...

08:26.907 --> 08:29.040
(strained breaths)

08:31.612 --> 08:33.111
Maybe Fedor's telling the truth.
(phone buzzes)

08:33.113 --> 08:35.146
Not just about her name.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.751
Nell just sent me
a message.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.753
Blood tests are in.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.790
They found polonium-210.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.895
FSB's poison of choice.

08:52.132 --> 08:56.801
That's what they used
to kill Litvinenko in 2006.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.571
She doesn't have long, G.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.218
(rasping breaths)

09:15.989 --> 09:17.055
(straining)

09:32.005 --> 09:34.239
So, Callen and Sam
checked out Mary--

09:34.241 --> 09:36.241
sorry, Katerina's house,

09:36.243 --> 09:37.876
and detected
radiation signatures

09:37.878 --> 09:39.177
in her bedroom
and her bathroom.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.012
So she was poisoned at home.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.213
Actually, those signatures
are more likely the results

09:42.215 --> 09:44.115
of polonium excreted
through her sweat.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.052
If you really want to
kill someone with Po-210,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.187
you got to inhale it
or ingest it.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.156
Checked out her
credit card statements,

09:51.158 --> 09:53.725
and every afternoon,
Katerina would stop by

09:53.727 --> 09:57.062
this bakery for a Danish
and a cup of tea.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.630
This was six days ago.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.365
First, this homeless man
distracts her,

10:00.367 --> 10:03.635
and then, watch this
sleight-of-hand swap.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.170
Cigarettes--
is nothing safe?

10:05.172 --> 10:08.006
I.D.'s on these two guys?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.775
Well, you can't see their faces,
but check out this guy's hand.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.011
He's got tattoos of
crosses on his knuckles.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.246
Means he spent time
in a Russian prison.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.681
Okay, I'm gonna go talk
to the waiter.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.049
Maybe he's seen
these guys before.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.185
And we should definitely check
for a radiation trail.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.220
I mean, chances are anything
the assassin touched

10:22.222 --> 10:23.989
will have a signature on it.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.724
We should check--
Oh, 'cause you want to

10:25.726 --> 10:27.392
come with me.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.928
No, that seems like
a good idea.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.913
I just thought that
Granger had mentioned,

10:31.914 --> 10:33.897
prior to this, that he maybe
wanted to get out of the office.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.900
Oh, well, Granger is
out of the office.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.235
He's out of the office all day.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.671
That's interesting,
he's out a lot lately.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.373
Where is Granger?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.074
This may come
as a surprise to you,

10:43.076 --> 10:45.944
but Granger doesn't really
share things with me.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.912
Not surprising.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.148
Hmm. So, you and me?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.250
Yeah, let's uh...

10:52.252 --> 10:54.753
let's saddle up,
shall we, pardner?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.388
And this pains me

10:56.390 --> 10:59.124
to even have to say,
but no grenades.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.126
They were jelly beans.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.194
(indistinct chatter)

11:09.336 --> 11:11.202
So, we didn't find any
more cigarettes inside.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.039
NEST team's on its
way to secure the scene.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.042
Good.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.010
You want to talk about it?

11:19.012 --> 11:22.213
Whatever's bothering you.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.915
You've been quiet
since the hospital.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.784
I don't know, it's just
something about the way

11:25.786 --> 11:26.785
Katerina looked at me.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.221
It was like she...

11:30.223 --> 11:31.256
I don't know.
Forget about it.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.324
(scoffs)
Wish I could.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.327
Radiation poisoning's
a bad way to go.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.829
Whoever she is,

11:37.831 --> 11:38.997
she didn't deserve this.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.700
(phone rings)

11:41.702 --> 11:43.334
Go ahead, Nell.
NELL: Hey, guys.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.136
So I found Katerina Polunin.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.405
She was born in Moscow in 1964,

11:47.407 --> 11:50.408
and lived there until
she vanished in 1988.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.976
SAM:
So let me guess.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.012
That's when Mary Reynolds
popped up in L.A.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.080
And you guessed right.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.314
All right.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.982
Let us know
if you find anything else.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.185
Will do.

12:00.187 --> 12:04.055
Okay, so in 1988, Katerina
fled the Soviet Union

12:04.057 --> 12:06.324
to start a new life in L.A.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.760
Why?

12:08.761 --> 12:11.195
And is that why she was targeted
all these years later?

12:12.199 --> 12:14.332
I have a theory.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.367
First we have to talk
to someone.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.369
And I don't think
you're gonna like it.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.374
I was wondering why I hadn't
seen Mary in almost a week.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.443
And you think
someone did this to her?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.345
We think a customer
may be involved.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.048
Have you seen somebody
here with, um...

12:30.050 --> 12:31.282
these tattoos?

12:31.284 --> 12:32.751
No.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.752
No, I don't think so.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.754
What about the homeless guy

12:35.756 --> 12:37.055
you threw out that morning?

12:37.057 --> 12:39.408
Him?

12:39.409 --> 12:41.760
Yeah, I-I think he lives
in the alley around the block.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.261
Usually harmless, though.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.964
Except for that day.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.399
Oh, uh, your partner,
does he have to do that?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.168
He's bothering
the customers.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.004
Oh, yeah, sorry about
that, I'll take care of it.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.005
Thanks for your help.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.540
Yeah.
Hey, um,

12:55.542 --> 12:58.276
is Mary gonna be all right?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.278
She's at St. Anne's Hospital.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.513
I'd visit her.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.249
ERIC:
<i> Ladies, relax.</i>

13:04.251 --> 13:07.118
You probably get more radiation
from your tanning beds.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.387
This is natural, jerk.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.889
Let's go, Portia.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.259
DEEKS:
Wow.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.361
Refresh my memory from ten
minutes ago, but didn't you

13:16.363 --> 13:18.396
say you were
gonna be discreet?

13:18.398 --> 13:21.099
Deeks, this table is hot.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.368
Agreed, but is it radioactive?
(alert noise)

13:23.370 --> 13:24.969
Well, not as much
as the cigarette.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.938
Found it on the sidewalk.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.174
Unfortunately,
that's all I that I found.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.575
Trail's gone cold, pardner.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.076
Maybe not.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.078
Follow me, kemosabe.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.381
(radiation detector noise)

13:36.383 --> 13:38.449
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.518
Yeah, but our
assassin has been here.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.220
Picking up some radiation.
(sniffs)

13:42.222 --> 13:43.822
Yeah, I'm picking up something.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.924
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's coming from right here.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.392
Beale, no, don't,
wait a minute, Beale...

13:47.394 --> 13:49.460
(screaming)

13:49.462 --> 13:51.296
Hmm. Huh.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.264
Dead homeless guy?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.365
Yeah.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.401
Dead homeless guy.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.404
ARKADY:
Wow, she's very beautiful.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.439
Is she single?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.141
Do we look like
a match-making service?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.176
Arkady, you helped a
lot of Soviet refugees

14:05.178 --> 14:06.544
find a home here in L.A.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.046
Is it possible

14:08.048 --> 14:11.316
that you helped Katerina
settle here back in '88?

14:11.318 --> 14:14.853
Like you say,
I helped many people.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.354
This is a waste of time.
No, I'm sorry.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.488
It was long time ago.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.591
My memory is not
so good anymore.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.028
Besides, it's not me
you should be asking.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.068
I only handled things
on this end.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.870
In Russia,

14:31.872 --> 14:34.205
it was all him.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.376
As far as we know,
he fled his farmhouse

14:38.378 --> 14:40.411
when we burned it in February.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.414
So unless you know
how to contact him....

14:43.416 --> 14:45.383
(TV screen beeps)
NELL: Guys?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.352
LAPD just responded
to Saint Anne's Hospital.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.587
Shots fired in Katerina's room.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.390
We're on our way.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.392
(TV beeps)

14:54.394 --> 14:56.361
You don't remember Katerina?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.495
Maybe she remembers you.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.330
You're coming with us.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.470
By the time we arrived
on the scene, it was all over.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.672
One suspect escaped,
another one dead.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.308
Both of them were armed.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.520
SAM:
No tattoos.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.489
What happened to the patient,
Mary Reynolds?

15:24.491 --> 15:26.991
They moved her to another
room so we could work the scene.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.459
Looked in bad shape, though.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.261
Doctor doesn't think
she'll wake up.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.430
What a shame.
I make trip for nothing.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.299
Good luck, my friends.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.367
Hold on, Arkady.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.038
If LAPD didn't shoot this guy,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.472
who did?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.574
That would be
suspect number three.

15:43.576 --> 15:47.679
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:47.681 --> 15:49.681
When we got here, he was just
standing over the body.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.349
Didn't say a word.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.016
Just dropped his gun
and surrendered.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.085
We ran his prints, but it's
like the guy doesn't exist.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.318
SAM:
You sure this is how
you want to handle this?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.654
CALLEN: Why, you don't think
he should be in that room?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.256
G, I'm not saying that I have a
problem putting him in there

16:32.258 --> 16:34.325
the guy did just kill someone,
I'm saying

16:34.327 --> 16:36.761
maybe you shouldn't
interrogate your own father.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.196
(door opens)
I have questions, Sam.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.131
Had 'em for a long time.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.067
And you will get your answers,
Mr. Callen.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.569
But right now, we have a

16:44.571 --> 16:46.270
case to solve.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.107
I understand that
this is personal.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.209
I know how to do my job, Hetty.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.731
I don't even know
what to call you.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.200
Garrison?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.502
Konstantin?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.203
Nikita?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.705
Father?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.207
(softly):
Not yet.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.181
Come to town, you don't want
to call your own son, huh?

17:30.183 --> 17:31.182
Grisha.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.484
In Russia, I made you a promise.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.786
The reasons.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.187
I will tell you.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.455
You can tell me
whatever you want.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.457
Will it be the truth?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.559
I don't know.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.660
'Cause the truth is
I don't know anything about you.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.397
(through speaker):
I don't know who you are.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.434
So why don't we start
with what I do know.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.370
1988, you helped a woman,
Katerina Polunin,

17:52.372 --> 17:54.422
escape from the USSR.

17:54.423 --> 17:56.473
Now, 28 years later, you're
found in her hospital room,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.342
standing over a man
you just killed.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.579
Who was he?

18:01.581 --> 18:05.783
He was sent by an FSB Officer
named Pavel Volkoff.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.786
You know him.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
He's helped us in the past.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.361
For a price, I'm sure.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.398
It may not have seemed it at the
time, but trust me when I say,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.466
you paid too much.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.467
What does he want?

18:22.469 --> 18:23.367
The usual.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.636
Power, money.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.405
As a young KGB Officer,

18:27.407 --> 18:28.773
Volkoff embezzled millions.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.510
He hid that money in an
account in his mistress' name.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.579
Katerina.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.881
So she stole the money
from Volkoff.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.183
Affairs are a messy business.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.519
But then,
so was the Soviet Union.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.489
The theft was
overshadowed by

18:44.491 --> 18:46.390
the collapse of the state.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.725
Forgotten.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.528
But not anymore.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.562
Volkoff's star

18:51.564 --> 18:53.965
is rising again.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.367
His enemies are looking
for dirt.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.370
If they can tie that money
to Katerina,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.471
Volkoff will be ruined.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.640
He will do anything
to stop them.

19:03.409 --> 19:07.411
Volkoff had us
arrest someone here.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.281
A man named Artem Fedor.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.216
He was working for
Volkoff's enemies.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.520
But when Fedor did not succeed,
they came to me.

19:15.522 --> 19:19.390
Asked me to find the woman I had
helped all those years ago.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.459
In return, I would be pardoned.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.862
So that's what this is, is it?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.864
That's why you're here?

19:29.335 --> 19:32.503
This is just a job for you.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.513
Well, now I know.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.648
(indistinct radio chatter)

19:43.650 --> 19:45.383
So guy's name is,
uh, Calvin Stokes.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.884
He's registered at
various homeless shelters.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.219
And according to the M.E.,

19:48.221 --> 19:49.854
his neck was snapped
about six days ago.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.956
Oh, same day
Katerina was poisoned.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.293
Meaning he was probably hired
by the assassin to distract her.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.828
Well, the waiter did say that
Calvin was usually harmless,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.197
so something had to
change his tune.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.198
Huh.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.567
Maybe a... $100 bill?

20:02.569 --> 20:03.734
That's a big note
for a homeless person.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.903
Or for any person,
for that matter.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.838
Wait a minute, why didn't
the assassin take it back?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.374
It was hidden in Calvin's shoe.
Ew.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.976
But cash is untraceable,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.244
and our assassin knew that.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.912
But you know what is traceable?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.697
Fingerprints.

20:16.698 --> 20:18.481
Boom. Nice. You got his I.D.?
No, but

20:18.484 --> 20:20.318
it's a new bill, so

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
when Nell ran the prints,
only two names came up.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.354
Hmm.
Uh, Calvin.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.822
Dead homeless guy.
Right.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.257
And a woman named Marsha Taylor.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.826
Now, she is a bank teller
in Mar Vista.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.895
So, when Nell scrubbed
the footage from her shift

20:30.897 --> 20:34.398
last week, she came up with...
the assassin.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.367
So you got his I.D.
No, got a fake I.D.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.869
Okay, Beale, what did you get?
Oh, his debit card.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.705
And it was just used at
a parking lot in Montrose.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.240
Can we go?
Giddyap.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.910
Oh, my God.
Nice work.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.395
I do not believe it.

20:47.396 --> 20:48.879
Pavel Volkoff is
an old friend of mine.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.982
I taught him
everything I know.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.651
Sounds like you taught
him a little too well.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.952
What does that mean?

20:54.954 --> 20:58.522
You're loyal to no one
but yourself, Arkady.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.591
You really expect
anything different

21:00.593 --> 21:02.960
from your prized pupil?

21:02.962 --> 21:05.363
I still have contacts at FSB.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.331
And I will be back
to prove you wrong.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.870
Thought he'd never leave.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.439
What have you found,

21:15.441 --> 21:16.574
Miss Jones?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.042
NELL:
Not much.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.509
Both the dead body
from the hospital

21:19.512 --> 21:22.280
and our assassin have been
completely backstopped.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.547
FSB?

21:23.549 --> 21:26.517
One would assume,
but I can't confirm it.

21:26.519 --> 21:27.885
Well, Volkoff would
make sure nothing

21:27.887 --> 21:29.353
could be traced back to him.

21:29.355 --> 21:30.454
What about Katerina?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.822
I did a complete
financial background.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.492
There is no evidence
of the amount of money

21:34.494 --> 21:37.328
your father was talking about
hidden anywhere.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.429
HETTY:
Thank you, Miss Jones.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.897
We're taking a lot
on faith here.

21:39.899 --> 21:40.931
I don't think
he's lying about the money

21:40.933 --> 21:42.633
but something's not adding up.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.968
The polonium.

21:43.970 --> 21:44.969
Why would Volkoff

21:44.971 --> 21:46.170
poison Katerina?

21:46.171 --> 21:47.370
Why not just kill her
immediately?

21:47.373 --> 21:48.873
And why wait

21:48.875 --> 21:50.541
six days to
finish the job?

21:52.612 --> 21:55.913
Unless... they were
buying more time.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.049
For what?

22:01.621 --> 22:03.020
Let me talk to him.

22:08.528 --> 22:12.763
Well, this is the assassin's
last known location.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.098
Getting a faint signature.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.450
There's a lot
of businesses

22:15.451 --> 22:16.801
around here.
Could be grabbing coffee,

22:16.803 --> 22:17.802
picking up laundry,

22:17.804 --> 22:19.804
or, God forbid,
doing CrossFit.

22:19.806 --> 22:20.971
Didn't you do CrossFit?

22:20.973 --> 22:23.441
That was Kensi,
but she talked about it

22:23.443 --> 22:24.909
so much it made me
feel like I did it.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.544
Hmm, first rule
of CrossFit,

22:26.546 --> 22:27.978
always talk
about CrossFit.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.013
Exactly.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.114
Now I'd give anything for her

22:30.116 --> 22:31.449
to be talking about that again.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.850
Kensi will be back
in the field.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.851
I'm sure of it.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.119
Thanks, man.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.620
No, Deeks.
Hmm?

22:36.622 --> 22:38.356
I'm serious.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.990
You know how I know Kensi
will be back in the field?

22:39.992 --> 22:42.526
Because I'm in the field.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.961
I mean, if you had said
that I'd be out here

22:43.963 --> 22:46.497
in-interrogating people
and throwing grenades,

22:46.499 --> 22:48.366
carrying a gun...
Okay, easy, partner.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.000
Put the gun, put the gun away.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.403
If you had said that
three years ago,

22:52.405 --> 22:53.671
I would have said,
"Impossible."

22:54.774 --> 22:57.007
But you guys,
you helped me.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.076
You supported me.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.945
That's what you're doing
for Kensi.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.514
So, yeah...

23:03.516 --> 23:06.083
she'll be back.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.551
Thank you.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.018
(gunshots)
All right, now you can
take your gun out.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.020
Stay to my left.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.021
Nell, we got shots fired!

23:11.023 --> 23:12.022
NELL:
Okay.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.792
Notifying LAPD, Callen and Sam.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.093
Down there.
Black Cow Café.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.795
Did you just say Black Cow Café?
(people screaming)

23:17.797 --> 23:18.896
Yeah, you want me
to pick you

23:18.898 --> 23:19.930
something up real quick?

23:19.932 --> 23:21.999
No, that's where

23:22.001 --> 23:24.034
Katerina's daughter,
Alex, works.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.469
MAN:
Move!

23:25.471 --> 23:28.072
(grunts)

23:28.074 --> 23:29.607
Federal agents!
Put it down!

23:30.810 --> 23:31.776
Down! Down!

23:32.745 --> 23:34.779
They got a hostage, Nell.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.114
Hang on.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.252
That's Alex.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.653
You know what would
be really helpful right now?

23:42.655 --> 23:44.488
Don't say grenade.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.157
Deeks, look out!

23:51.764 --> 23:53.063
Stay down.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.131
(shouts)

23:59.038 --> 24:00.938
(tires screech)

24:06.913 --> 24:07.978
Son of a bitch.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.971
Feel like we keep
arriving after the action.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.105
Full backstop?

24:35.107 --> 24:36.251
Yep.

24:36.252 --> 24:37.396
FSB strikes again.

24:37.397 --> 24:38.541
What about
the getaway car?
Nell's tracking it,

24:38.544 --> 24:40.544
but she thinks they
may have swapped vehicles.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.879
Where's Eric?
He get hurt?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.180
He's actually inside
interviewing witnesses.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.515
He did... great,

24:44.517 --> 24:45.716
actually.
He might've...

24:45.718 --> 24:48.686
kind of... sort of
saved my life.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.521
Maybe.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.256
Don't worry, Deeks.
We won't tell anyone.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.593
I get Volkoff going
after Katerina,

24:55.595 --> 24:57.928
but why her daughter?

24:57.930 --> 25:00.197
Maybe she knows
where the money is.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.849
And she's still working
as a waitress?

25:01.850 --> 25:03.500
'Cause I would be island hopping
in the Caribbean.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.668
Well, maybe Volkoff's
getting desperate.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.669
Hey, guys.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.105
Bulletproof Beale.
(sighs)

25:08.107 --> 25:09.206
Hear you saved
Deeks' life today.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.208
Ah, you know.
Maybe.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.543
(clears throat)
We got a problem.

25:12.545 --> 25:13.544
Just learned that Alex

25:13.546 --> 25:14.979
has a son.
He's five years old.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.515
He's in preschool in Glendale.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.516
If they're willing
to go after Alex,

25:18.518 --> 25:19.683
they might go after her son.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.784
CALLEN:
Go pick up the kid.

25:20.786 --> 25:21.785
Keep him safe.

25:21.787 --> 25:24.655
On it.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.524
Where would
Volkoff's men take Alex?

25:26.526 --> 25:28.526
FSB safe house?

25:28.528 --> 25:30.094
That's what I'd do.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.195
So, who do we
know that has

25:31.197 --> 25:33.230
connections
within the FSB?

25:33.232 --> 25:34.798
Seriously?

25:34.800 --> 25:35.866
Again?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.801
This isn't your
lucky day, is it?

25:37.803 --> 25:39.570
<i> Do you know</i>

25:39.572 --> 25:40.571
who I am?

25:42.808 --> 25:44.909
<i>Da.</i>

25:44.911 --> 25:47.578
You were Clara's handler.

25:47.580 --> 25:52.249
It's more than 40 years since
Callen's mother was killed.

25:54.854 --> 25:58.556
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of her.

25:58.558 --> 26:02.326
How different all
our lives would be

26:02.328 --> 26:06.597
if I'd just been able to
reach her on that beach.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.100
We are all to blame.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.272
If I had not tried
to recruit Clara, but I did.

26:15.274 --> 26:19.677
It was my job
as a KGB officer.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.079
But she ended up recruiting you.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.281
She was a very

26:24.283 --> 26:26.183
persuasive woman.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.953
And beautiful.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.621
Always helps.

26:30.623 --> 26:34.725
Is that why you
recruited Katerina?

26:39.031 --> 26:43.067
By '88, you were
working for the CIA.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.370
You were her handler.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.173
<i> Da.</i>

26:49.175 --> 26:51.742
I put Katerina's life in danger,

26:51.744 --> 26:53.944
that's why I had
to get her out...

26:53.946 --> 26:57.681
and she was safe... for awhile.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.754
I hate to tell you this...

27:03.756 --> 27:07.124
but Katerina died
less than an hour ago.

27:10.630 --> 27:14.765
There was no offer of pardon,
was there?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.936
This mission was
always personal.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.794
I wasn't

27:43.796 --> 27:45.829
able to save Clara,

27:45.831 --> 27:49.867
but I was able to save her son.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.004
Time for you

27:54.006 --> 27:58.375
to finish what
you started.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.363
Tomorrow
we'll try a short,

28:19.365 --> 28:20.798
light jog, but until then,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.900
let's work on your fine
motor hand skills.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.301
(laughs)

28:24.303 --> 28:25.436
Hello.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.304
You'd make a
fantastic bean counter.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.239
(laughs)

28:29.241 --> 28:31.041
I've got a treat for you two.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.776
Ew, that looks
disgusting,

28:32.778 --> 28:33.777
even for here.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.179
It's not to eat,

28:35.181 --> 28:36.780
it's for ADL practice.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.082
I'm sorry, what?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.483
Activities of
Daily Living.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.785
Have you not been
paying attention?

28:41.787 --> 28:43.987
Using a knife and fork is a
good exercise that requires you

28:43.989 --> 28:45.756
to use isolated
finger movements.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.357
So, we don't
have to eat this?
No...

28:47.359 --> 28:48.459
but you can if you want.

28:48.461 --> 28:49.860
Mm.
EMILY:
Bon appetite.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.031
Okay.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.907
That... is a very
ladylike grip

29:03.909 --> 29:05.876
you have there,
Special K.
Shut up.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.177
Is food good?

29:07.179 --> 29:08.812
(imitating caveman):
Chongo like.

29:08.814 --> 29:11.115
Nope.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.850
Yeah, you're definitely not
restaurant ready.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.021
(sighs)

29:18.023 --> 29:19.123
Really?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.824
Must be my awkward, Chongo grip.

29:20.826 --> 29:21.992
(whispering):
Sorry.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.097
Okay, seriously?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.482
You want a piece of this?

29:28.483 --> 29:29.866
Don't bite off more
than you can chew.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.937
Don't... don't.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.005
(chuckles)

29:42.014 --> 29:43.547
ARKADY:
I cannot help you.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.517
My contacts at FSB
have gone silent.

29:46.519 --> 29:47.851
Volkoff?

29:47.853 --> 29:50.387
I suspect.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.824
He has positioned himself
to head up FSB.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.125
That's a lot of power.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.527
Second only to Putin.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.862
People have
killed for less.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.097
Pavel has shown

30:00.099 --> 30:01.932
his true colors.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.967
He's not the man
I thought he was.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.904
Neither are you, Arkady.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.905
That's his way

30:07.907 --> 30:09.306
of apologizing.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.876
His way of ruining it.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.044
I appreciate it,

30:14.046 --> 30:15.045
my friend.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.246
I'm just sorry

30:16.248 --> 30:17.981
I could not do more.

30:22.521 --> 30:23.520
<i> We need another way</i>

30:23.522 --> 30:24.521
to find Alex.

30:24.523 --> 30:25.989
NELL:
Hey, Callen.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.057
Go ahead, Nell.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.894
Um, is your dad with you?

30:30.896 --> 30:31.929
Because...

30:31.931 --> 30:33.096
he is not in the boatshed.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.398
What?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.399
Where's Hetty?

30:35.401 --> 30:38.235
Right here, Mr. Callen.

30:38.237 --> 30:42.840
I'll explain later, but right
now we need to find your father.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.842
It appears he slipped away.

30:44.844 --> 30:49.346
I assume that you have prepared
for this eventuality?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.415
Activate tracker 7B.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.618
Um, sure.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.953
I'm on it.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.888
Did you put a tracker
on your dad?

30:57.890 --> 30:58.889
Have you met his dad?

30:59.925 --> 31:01.925
No.
If you had,

31:01.926 --> 31:03.926
you'd put a tracker
on him, too.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.363
<i> There's no way Hetty</i>

31:06.365 --> 31:08.198
let your father slip away
like that.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.199
Hell no.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.834
She released him.

31:10.835 --> 31:12.468
And she better have
a damn good reason.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.937
Sam, turn right.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.505
He's just around the corner.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.913
That's Alex.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.348
What the
hell's going on?

31:28.888 --> 31:31.088
Alex, are you all right?

31:31.090 --> 31:32.990
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Where's my son?

31:32.992 --> 31:33.991
He's safe.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.559
Where's you get this jacket?

31:35.561 --> 31:36.593
He gave it to me.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.929
He said it was
cold outside.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.163
He told them to let me go,
that he had

31:40.165 --> 31:41.498
what they were looking for.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.101
The money.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.403
Your dad had it all along.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.973
Hospital was an ambush.

31:49.975 --> 31:51.508
Volkoff poisoned Katerina
'cause he knew

31:51.510 --> 31:52.976
he could lure my dad out.

31:52.978 --> 31:56.280
Hetty knew he'd
lead us to Alex.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.115
He made a trade,
the money for her.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.217
Where'd they take you?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.619
Um, I don't know.
I don't know.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.222
They-they, they put a hood
over my head

32:05.224 --> 32:08.292
and dropped me off
about a block from here.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.260
Uh, I'm supposed to, um,

32:10.262 --> 32:13.096
call this number when I'm--
when I'm safe.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.197
(phone dialing)
You okay?

32:14.199 --> 32:15.198
Yeah.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.634
(line ringing)

32:21.941 --> 32:23.307
Are you safe?

32:23.309 --> 32:25.175
She's safe. Where are you?

32:26.145 --> 32:28.312
I am sorry, Grisha.

32:29.315 --> 32:32.215
I am sorry
I cannot keep my promise.

32:32.217 --> 32:35.419
I will be with your mother soon.

32:38.691 --> 32:39.957
(phone beeps)

32:58.110 --> 32:59.443
Here we go.
Here's your ride.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.978
ALEX:
Oh, thank God.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.145
SAM: You're gonna
go with him.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.380
(tires screech)

33:03.382 --> 33:05.048
(SUV door opens, closes)

33:05.050 --> 33:07.184
Alex, Detective Deeks.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.286
He'll take you
to your son.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.088
He's okay and he's very excited
to see you.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.589
(chuckles)
Come with me,
let's go.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.060
Nell, any luck
tracing that call yet?

33:17.062 --> 33:20.030
Yep, we've got it down
to a square mile.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.631
Eric's overlaying the tracker's
digital footprint

33:21.633 --> 33:23.166
to try to narrow it some more.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.002
Alex, wait up.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.303
How long ago did he
give you this jacket?

33:26.305 --> 33:28.138
Uh, 15, maybe 20 minutes?

33:28.140 --> 33:29.139
Did you get that?

33:29.141 --> 33:30.374
(typing)

33:30.376 --> 33:31.742
Got it.

33:31.744 --> 33:35.145
1724 Rohrman Street.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.255
CALLEN:
I see Garrison

33:45.257 --> 33:47.157
and two FSB agents.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.558
They look like they're
losing their patience.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.027
(grunting)

33:50.029 --> 33:52.262
He's not gonna
last much longer.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.297
The front door's gated.
By the time we break it down,

33:54.299 --> 33:56.033
he'll be dead.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.367
Yeah, we'll be next.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.136
I got an idea.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.604
You want to share it?

34:14.086 --> 34:15.152
(grunts)

34:20.225 --> 34:22.225
(automatic gunfire)

34:22.227 --> 34:23.727
We clear?

34:27.232 --> 34:29.232
<i>Da.</i> It is just the two of them.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.535
SAM:
I'll check it out.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.742
You took a big risk.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.344
Not so big.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.380
I trusted Hetty
would not let me go

34:43.382 --> 34:45.449
without tracking me.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.784
Yeah, well,

34:47.786 --> 34:50.454
I need to have a talk with her
about keeping secrets.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.622
Maybe you and I
need to have the same talk.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.358
The money--

34:55.360 --> 34:57.094
where is it?

34:57.863 --> 35:01.231
I told them the truth.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.201
They didn't believe me.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.203
Will you?

35:06.205 --> 35:08.472
Try me.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.340
The money is gone.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.142
I donated it decades ago--

35:12.144 --> 35:15.846
refugee charities,
peace organizations--

35:15.848 --> 35:17.747
people who really needed it.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.316
I was done with war.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.687
But somehow,
it is never done with me.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.260
KENSI:<i> You eat</i>
<i> your vegetables, Marine!</i>

35:30.262 --> 35:33.130
Eat the vegetables.
You are so dead.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.198
Okay, okay. You guys
are making a mess.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.333
Well, she started it.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.835
Yeah, but I
also finished it.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.804
You two are worse than a couple
of six year olds.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.172
Hi.
What's up brah?

35:42.174 --> 35:42.839
What's going on?
How's therapy?

35:42.841 --> 35:43.840
Uh, physically,

35:43.842 --> 35:45.709
she's improving,
but mentally,

35:45.711 --> 35:46.843
she's going
downhill fast.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.345
(whistles)

35:48.346 --> 35:49.846
Yeah, like you would know.
I'm really hungry,

35:49.848 --> 35:50.914
where would you like to go?

35:50.916 --> 35:51.915
I don't know,
it looks like

35:51.917 --> 35:52.916
you may have
already eaten.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.284
What?
Yeah.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.452
Carrot?

35:55.454 --> 35:57.587
(chuckles)
Cheers.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.394
DEEKS:
No. No, no, no, no.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.263
You can't slide it,
you got to pick it up.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.797
This is about 80L therapy,
all right, baby?

36:07.799 --> 36:09.232
Not checkers.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.471
So what's the story
with that guy?

36:14.473 --> 36:15.505
What guy?

36:15.507 --> 36:16.773
That guy from the...
you know,

36:16.775 --> 36:18.441
the guy, Sullivan,
from the hospital.

36:18.443 --> 36:20.277
What about him?

36:20.279 --> 36:21.444
I don't know,
you guys are

36:21.446 --> 36:22.679
just spending
a lot of time together.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.713
Yeah, why do you
think that is?

36:23.715 --> 36:24.714
We're stuck in a
hospital for months,

36:24.716 --> 36:27.317
doing therapy.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.653
Why, are you jealous?

36:29.655 --> 36:30.887
A little bit jealous?

36:30.889 --> 36:31.888
(chuckles)

36:31.890 --> 36:33.623
I was just curious.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.228
Crap!

36:38.230 --> 36:39.362
It's okay. It's fine, hey.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.630
Listen, I'll just reset it.

36:42.668 --> 36:43.867
I'm never
gonna come back.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.335
I can't even
dress myself,

36:45.337 --> 36:46.636
I can't pick up
a checkers piece,

36:46.638 --> 36:47.938
I can't do anything.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.472
Doctors said six months.
How long has it been?

36:49.474 --> 36:51.775
(exhales)

36:51.777 --> 36:52.776
Two?

36:52.778 --> 36:54.844
It's been two.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.613
You're only a third
of the way there.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.315
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.617
Besides, in all
my years as a cop

37:00.619 --> 37:02.219
and also as
an NCIS agent,

37:02.220 --> 37:03.820
I don't think I've ever had
to play checkers on a case.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.355
I think you'll be fine.

37:05.356 --> 37:06.889
Yeah, but you have
had to draw your gun.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.930
Let me see your hand.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.933
Not that hand,
your other hand.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.268
Oh, you mean my claw?
Yeah.

37:18.269 --> 37:19.602
This thing?
(chuckles)
Give me the claw.

37:19.603 --> 37:20.936
Oh, yeah.
Give me that sexy
little claw.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.239
I like a good claw,

37:22.241 --> 37:24.241
it's like dating a,
a sexy pirate.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.377
Okay, I shouldn't
have said anything.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.814
(sighs)

38:01.813 --> 38:04.914
(chuckles softly)

38:05.884 --> 38:07.717
HETTY:
Well, well.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.687
I was beginning to
fear the worst.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.657
I'm not dead yet, Henrietta.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.959
Not even close.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.296
Owen, no one
would blame you

38:19.298 --> 38:21.398
if you took
some time off.

38:22.367 --> 38:24.567
You know me better than that.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.969
And when

38:25.971 --> 38:28.905
I do go,

38:28.907 --> 38:30.807
it's not gonna be
sitting at home.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.412
Have you at least spoken
with your daughter?

38:35.414 --> 38:38.014
No. Not yet.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.621
Jones filled me in
on the events of the day.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.790
You know, that was one
hell of a gamble you took--

38:46.792 --> 38:48.825
letting Callen's father go.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.828
If he had died,
Callen never

38:51.830 --> 38:53.363
would have forgiven you.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.366
True.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.401
And I would have had to
live with that.

39:00.372 --> 39:04.374
But if I hadn't let
Callen's father save that girl,

39:04.376 --> 39:08.611
he would have had to live
with something far worse.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.650
So what's next?

39:13.652 --> 39:16.486
That's for Mr. Callen to decide.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.728
MAN: I'm so sorry
for your loss.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.796
(indistinct chatter)

39:38.944 --> 39:41.911
It is beautiful here.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.980
It is.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.886
Grisha, I intend to
keep my promise.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.721
You deserve

39:51.723 --> 39:54.023
to know the reasons,
why I wasn't

39:54.025 --> 39:55.024
part of your life.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.993
Or my sister's life.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.966
If you had been a
part of our lives...

40:02.968 --> 40:04.667
or her's...

40:05.637 --> 40:07.470
she might still be here.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.839
I could not be there for you,
not the way

40:09.841 --> 40:10.874
you needed me.

40:10.876 --> 40:11.975
Did you even try?

40:11.977 --> 40:13.977
The work I did spared no one.

40:13.979 --> 40:17.046
Least of all,
those closest to me.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.649
Better for everyone--

40:19.651 --> 40:22.051
for both of you--
that I sever all ties.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.555
Disappear from the world.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.592
Grisha, I don't expect
you to understand,

40:29.594 --> 40:31.995
or to forgive me, but you had

40:31.997 --> 40:34.063
a better chance
on your own.

40:36.501 --> 40:37.867
Uh, you're right.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.438
I don't forgive you.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.142
And I don't know
that I ever will.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.884
But I understand.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.787
I know the work
you did with Arkady

40:57.789 --> 40:59.656
with Arkady and the refugees,
you saved a lot of people.

40:59.658 --> 41:00.857
Not enough.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.592
Not the people I loved.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.994
Like your mother.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.996
(voice breaking):
And your sister.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.134
And Katerina.

41:22.914 --> 41:25.148
Volkoff poisoned Katerina
to lure you out.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.484
And when that failed,

41:27.486 --> 41:29.052
he knew to go after Alex.

41:32.757 --> 41:33.890
How long have you known?

41:33.892 --> 41:34.891
Not long.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.793
Before you fled Russia,

41:36.795 --> 41:40.129
I asked Arkady to look in
on Katerina.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.799
You've been in contact
with Arkady?

41:42.801 --> 41:46.102
It's how I learned
about her poisoning.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.205
And how I learned
that she had a daughter

41:49.207 --> 41:51.708
shortly after arriving
in the U.S.
