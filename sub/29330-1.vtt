What do you have in here,
a body?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.291
Mother, you know
I don't like dark humor.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.093
Now, can you please hustle?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.527
I need to make sure
I get the right bed

01:35.529 --> 01:37.629
before Fiona takes it
and hogs up all the sunlight.

01:37.631 --> 01:42.167
I'm trying, sweetie. It's just
this thing is really heavy.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.369
Perhaps, I don't know,
if you could help me a bit?

01:45.272 --> 01:46.338
Really?

01:46.340 --> 01:49.141
Can you imagine what would
happen if some of the girls

01:49.143 --> 01:52.211
saw me carrying luggage? Ew!

01:52.213 --> 01:56.381
I imagined they'd think
you were... considerate.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.651
Wrong. They'd think I'm weak.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.321
This is my last year at Next
Level, and I am not going to let

02:02.323 --> 02:03.722
any of the girls here
think for a second

02:03.724 --> 02:05.591
that they're as good as me.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.160
Well, obviously,
I'm more talented.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.596
But this is also about image.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.398
Do you think Beyonce
ever carried her own luggage?

02:13.400 --> 02:16.168
I think, uh,
Beyonce's bodyguards

02:16.170 --> 02:18.604
are slightly stronger

02:18.606 --> 02:20.272
than me.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.510
I am so glad
I got dad's core-strength genes.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.545
- You're such a complainer.
- Hey, missy.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.414
I have had it with your sass.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.616
I am not a servant.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.320
I'm your parent, and I deserve
to be treated as such.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.290
Fine. Let's go home.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.460
The academy can keep
your non-refundable deposit,

02:41.462 --> 02:43.629
and I'll spend the last two
weeks of summer reminding you

02:43.631 --> 02:46.465
of how much I hate you for
pulling the plug on my dreams.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.267
And for the rest of your life,

02:48.269 --> 02:51.703
instead of being the mother
of the next Selena Gomez,

02:51.705 --> 02:53.438

03:16.197 --> 03:19.464
I, uh, am going over your file.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.233
It's not so great.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.536
Wait, me?

03:26.674 --> 03:28.674
Yeah. Well,
there's nobody else in the room.

03:28.676 --> 03:32.211
So it's-it's...
Who else would I be talking to?

03:32.213 --> 03:34.646
I don't know, I thought
you were recording a vlog

03:34.648 --> 03:36.782
about boring old-guy stuff.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.318
Uh, no, this isn't a vlog, I...

03:39.320 --> 03:40.719
This is just an interview
between us.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.621
- An interview?
- Yeah.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.756
But you already accepted me.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.292
If you're gonna kick me out,
just hurry up and tell me

03:47.294 --> 03:50.295
so I can have my stepdad come
scoop me up before he gets too--

03:50.297 --> 03:51.530
No, no, no,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Kelly,

03:51.532 --> 03:52.798
we're not kicking you out.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.633
I just wanna make sure
that you're aware

03:54.635 --> 03:57.336
that <i> we</i> are all <i> aware...</i>

03:58.305 --> 04:01.607
of your... situation,
that's all.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.775
Are you talking about
how I was kicked out

04:03.777 --> 04:05.477
of that Performing Arts camp?

04:05.479 --> 04:08.580
Three.
Three Performing Arts camps.

04:08.582 --> 04:12.818
- No. No, I wasn't...
- Yeah. It's right here.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.555
And all three of them said
you were very disruptive.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.624
No, I-I was bored.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.560
- I believe you.
- You do?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.462
Yes, and I saw
your audition tape.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.732
You were fantastic!
I mean, phenomenal!

04:26.734 --> 04:30.535
- Well, you have good taste.
- Thank you.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.338
I do have to say, it is
the only reason you're here.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.842
Something tells me you're going
to be a real headache.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.278
You could try Tylenol.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.481
Look, Kelly, just do me a favor.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.484
Don't make me look like a fool
for giving away

04:45.486 --> 04:49.321
one of the most coveted
Performing Arts Academy spots

04:49.323 --> 04:52.291
in the United States to a girl

04:52.293 --> 04:56.428
who, at best, could be described
as spirited

04:56.430 --> 04:59.531
and at worst, could be described
as a problem child.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.533
I get it.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.603
I'm sure you don't need my help
to look like a fool, Bob.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.904
All right! See?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.839

would be a...

some more volume into my hair.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.022
All right.
Hi, everybody, how you doin'?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.024
Five bucks says he starts
with a lame dance joke.

12:40.026 --> 12:44.095
Okay. What kind of music
do ghosts listen to?

12:44.097 --> 12:47.332
[all] Soul music!

12:47.334 --> 12:48.933
[Bob] It's okay,
you've heard that one.

12:48.935 --> 12:52.003
What kind of performance
do cars make?

12:52.005 --> 12:54.339
[all] Brake-dancing!

12:54.341 --> 12:56.107
Okay. Movin' on.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.878
I wanna welcome you
to the 21st Annual

12:59.880 --> 13:03.348
Next Level Performing Arts
Academy session.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.552
If you're here right now,
you're chasing greatness.

13:07.554 --> 13:11.990
Our motto is that
superstars are not born...

13:13.260 --> 13:14.325
they're made.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.096
Shaped, sculpted.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.364
As many of you already know,

13:19.366 --> 13:24.068
this can be
a very competitive environment.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.570
You have to want it.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.274
You have to want to be the best.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.944
Every summer,
we pick one young lady

13:33.980 --> 13:37.916
and we name her... Miss Next.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.986
Remember, it does not matter
what your talent is.

13:41.988 --> 13:46.257
You just have to have... it!

13:46.259 --> 13:49.160
Cindy Stallings knows exactly
what I'm talking about.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.996
Cindy is going
for a record third straight

13:51.998 --> 13:54.599
Next Level Award title.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.367
Just like I told her
last summer,

13:56.369 --> 13:59.370
the competition is fierce.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.406
Good news, though,

14:02.242 --> 14:05.076
cream rises to the top.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.948
Now, normally, I give
my little talk right about now

14:09.950 --> 14:12.917
about who out there
is achieving greatness,

14:12.919 --> 14:16.387
striving after it.
I don't have to today.

14:16.389 --> 14:21.059
Ladies, it is my pleasure
to introduce to you now

14:21.061 --> 14:24.295
to a very close
personal friend of mine

14:24.297 --> 14:28.199
and recent Next Level winner.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.169
Would you help me bring out

14:31.171 --> 14:33.171
Jasmine Joel?

14:33.173 --> 14:36.174
[cheering]

14:38.411 --> 14:41.212
[inhales sharply]
Okay, okay. Settle down, guys.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.048
Don't get too excited. I mean,
you haven't tried the food yet.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.018
When I graduated here,
I was determined to do

14:47.020 --> 14:48.887
a couple of things with my life.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.190
One, I was going to change
my life with music.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.192
Two, I was going to try
and make a difference

14:54.194 --> 14:56.928
by giving something back
and never forgetting

14:56.930 --> 14:59.964
that it takes a team
to make a star shine brightest.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.467
So when Bob asked me to come
back and volunteer my time

15:02.469 --> 15:05.236
to help a new wave of girls
at Next Level,

15:05.238 --> 15:06.271
I jumped at the chance.

15:06.273 --> 15:11.442
So the question is,
which one of you is next?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.344
Because here
at this Performing Arts camp,

15:13.346 --> 15:16.481
you have just three weeks
to prove that you're a star

15:16.483 --> 15:18.383
or you're just passing through.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.184
So let's do it, girls.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.121
Stand up, stretch out,
and when I call your name,

15:23.123 --> 15:24.522

16:47.140 --> 16:48.573
- May I help you, boys?
- Hi.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.475
We're from Saint John's Prep.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.011
The new basketball camp
across campus.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.448
- Okay.
- Oh, we were on our morning run.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.183
And, uh, we heard some singing,

16:59.185 --> 17:01.119
so we thought we'd stop by
and check it out.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.321
Actually,
I don't even like basketball.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.357
I really just want to be...
a dancer, babe.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.026
- [indistinct chatter]
- [girl 1] What?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.794
- What's your name?
- Travis Perkins.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.628
Mr. Perkins, you have two things
going for you

17:11.631 --> 17:13.297
that I will always respect.

17:13.299 --> 17:16.501
Obviously, good looks.
What else?

17:16.502 --> 17:18.301
You can dance a little

17:18.304 --> 17:22.240
and you have
unwavering confidence.

Afraid I was born
with that affliction.

He thinks he's a lot better at
basketball than he actually is.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.050
- Let me ask you boys a question.
- [Conor] Shoot.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.185
When you're doing
your basketball

17:34.187 --> 17:36.054
and you're in the zone,
as they say,

17:36.056 --> 17:39.323
ready to make a, a basket
or whatever,

17:39.325 --> 17:41.392
would you like it if
a group of strangers barged in

17:41.394 --> 17:43.061
during your big moment?

17:44.397 --> 17:47.598
Then continue what you were
doing and go take a hike.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.401
I like your style.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.437
You ladies
are in good hands here.

- [clatters]

18:14.360 --> 18:15.426
[groans]

18:17.697 --> 18:19.564
There were boys
in the auditorium this morning.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.365
- Basketball players.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.600
The Saint John's kids.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.304
They are some top recruits.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.240
Wait, they bothered you?
They said something?

18:29.242 --> 18:30.575
What did they do?
Did they do something?

18:30.577 --> 18:32.577
I'm gonna take care of this,
this cannot happen

18:32.579 --> 18:34.645
and it will not happen
on my watch.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.582
I'm gonna call over there and
we're gonna nip this in the bud.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.351
This is not gonna happen again.
I'm very sorry about it.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.521
You girls need unobstructed
focus, plain and simple.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.690
I'm gonna handle this.
I'm sorry, I get it.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.892
- I get what you're sayin'.
- No.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.228
I want to invite them
to Show Night.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.631
- You do?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.433
The energy changed
when the boys were there.

18:55.435 --> 18:59.737
The girls were... shy, nervous.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.540
That's-tha... And now you think
that's a good thing?

19:03.476 --> 19:06.644
[sighs]
This is the first performance

19:06.646 --> 19:08.546
of the competition.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.648
Some of these girls
treat this academy like,

19:10.650 --> 19:13.484
like a slumber party, a safe
place to let their hair down.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.386
There's no pressure.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.625
Hm. Do you know
what pressure does to coal?

19:21.494 --> 19:25.263
Crushes it into fine, ashy dust.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.932
- It make diamonds.
- Makes diamonds.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.200
Mm-hmm.

19:29.202 --> 19:34.472
I have got to go get
a couple bags of coal.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.747
Legend has it, this man-beast
is drawn to music,

19:43.650 --> 19:46.317
but his true intention
is to steal little girls

19:46.319 --> 19:48.519
who wander into the woods alone.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.222
Every couple of years,

19:51.958 --> 19:53.758
a little girl gets taken,

19:53.760 --> 19:56.360
never to be heard from again.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.529
State troopers have done sweeps
when some of the locals

19:58.531 --> 20:01.332
complained
about this deranged townie,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.801
but nobody's been able
to catch him in the act.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.605
As a senior member
of this Performing Arts camp,

20:08.341 --> 20:10.508
I want to tell you all,

20:10.510 --> 20:12.610
be afraid,

20:12.612 --> 20:14.679
very afraid,

20:15.682 --> 20:19.283
of the monster, the myth,

20:35.501 --> 20:39.337
Ghost-night, girl-bonding.
But Forest Dude?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.672
Come on, that's got to be
the stupidest name

20:41.674 --> 20:43.774
I've heard in my life.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.445
Okay, free time's over.

Everybody get back
to your dorms.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.692
[Cindy] I don't even think
she's smart enough

21:01.694 --> 21:03.327
to know nobody likes her.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.496
She's friends with, like,
seven-year-olds.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.797
I heard she got kicked out
of her own school

21:06.799 --> 21:09.500
because, basically,
everyone hated her.

21:09.502 --> 21:12.370
Well, we tried to be nice,
but she obviously hates

21:12.372 --> 21:15.039
all of our traditions
and doesn't wanna be included.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.607
I think the best thing to do
from now on

21:16.609 --> 21:18.509
is just to ignore her.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.810

just can't catch anything.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.611
After the game, as reporters
flocked to the hoop,

21:53.613 --> 21:56.514
he said he's going to stop
playing basketball forever,

21:56.516 --> 21:57.782
because he's a hoop.

you're so ultra-competitive

22:32.785 --> 22:34.685
that you don't wanna make
friends with the other girls

22:34.687 --> 22:37.421

then you can't be a superstar.

people hide behind having fun

because they're afraid
to test themselves.

what it takes to be the best,

Yeah. Actually, I want to quit
after every other throw.

it drives me even more crazy

so much, I can't even breathe.

Go get 'em!
I'll keep the hoop company.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.722
Five, six, seven, eight.
Right, left, right.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.024
Left, right, left. You guys
just see how she did that?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.560
It was really big so that
everyone in the back can see it.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.662
And she added her hips
so that it's kind of her own,

23:51.664 --> 23:53.197
but still the choreography.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.933
Kelly, nice of you
to join us today.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.501
Are you gonna put some work in?

23:57.503 --> 23:58.636
[Kelly] I am.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.773
And, Jasmine,
if it's cool with you,

24:02.775 --> 24:04.775
I think I'm gonna go ahead
and win this whole

24:04.777 --> 24:06.977
Miss Next Level Award deal.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.980
[indistinct chatter]

24:35.942 --> 24:37.007
Lucy?

24:37.844 --> 24:38.909
What?

24:39.879 --> 24:41.712
Would you like to play Uno
with us?

24:41.714 --> 24:42.880
Yes.

24:44.550 --> 24:47.518
No. Definitely not.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.521
- Just leave me alone.
- Okay.

24:52.959 --> 24:57.561
Girls, everybody, gather around.
This is super important.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.797
You're not going to believe
this, Jasmine just told me

24:59.799 --> 25:01.599
that at this year's Show Night,
the boys

25:01.601 --> 25:02.833
from basketball camp
are invited.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.036
Yay! Yay...
No.

25:06.038 --> 25:10.741
T-that, that's terr-terrible.
Terrible thing.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.077
A bunch of cagers who don't know
anything about music or dance,

25:13.079 --> 25:16.881
at our big night?
I can't even think about it.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.849
But here's the good news.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.752
As your fearless leader,
I talked to Director Bob.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.890
He said that if you all sign
this statement saying

25:25.892 --> 25:27.725
you don't want the boys
at our Show Night,

25:27.727 --> 25:31.295
he can make this whole nightmare
just go away.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.731
What's wrong with a couple
of boys from the basketball camp

25:33.733 --> 25:34.865
coming to Show Night?

25:34.867 --> 25:35.866
They're not into music.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.568
How do you know?

25:38.304 --> 25:40.304
Girls, just ignore her.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.740
She's just trying to be
all different again.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.943
- What are you so afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.614
You've built this little world
where you boss everybody around,

25:50.616 --> 25:52.683
making anyone else
that doesn't agree with you

25:52.685 --> 25:55.719
feel like an outsider.
It's not about the boys.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.689
It's about you wanting control
once again.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.991
I think we should have
as many people at Show Night

26:00.993 --> 26:02.626
as we can fit.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.094
Isn't this whole
Performing Arts camp

26:04.096 --> 26:06.030
built on the idea
that you can chase your dreams

26:06.032 --> 26:07.898
to become superstars?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.734
'Cause I can promise you guys
one thing.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.770
If you're worried
about a couple of teenagers

26:12.772 --> 26:14.772
sitting in the audience
at Show Night,

26:14.774 --> 26:16.907
you're never gonna be able
to handle bringing your talent

26:16.909 --> 26:18.709
to the real world.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.112
Lucy, what are you doing?

26:23.749 --> 26:26.884
You haven't performed for one
second in the past three years.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.852
The only reason you're here
is because your mother

26:28.854 --> 26:31.722
sang some song in the '80s
that nobody remembers.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.991
Nobody even knows what you do.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.694
And now, all of a sudden,
you want a larger audience?

26:36.696 --> 26:40.764
I just thought it would be nice
if we had--

26:40.766 --> 26:41.832
You're pathetic.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.902
Fine, I was trying to save
some of you guys

26:44.904 --> 26:47.171
from embarrassing yourselves
in front of a larger crowd,

26:47.173 --> 26:49.840
but forget it,
you're on your own.

26:54.814 --> 26:58.048
Hey... thanks for speaking up.

26:59.085 --> 27:02.052
Look, I-I don't know what you do

27:02.054 --> 27:05.990
and it's your right
to dance or perform

27:06.859 --> 27:09.927
or whatever you do, o-or not.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.097
But if you ever want
to give it a try,

27:13.099 --> 27:15.633
I would love to see you
do your thing.

- Thanks, coach.
- No problem.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.194
I didn't know
you knew basketball.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.330
Yeah. Well, I'm kind of
impressive that way.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.001
Fine. Can I be honest?

Go ahead.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.104
I have no clue what I just said.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.139
I searched up basketball talk
on the Internet

30:09.141 --> 30:11.108

I was super smart.

You're still hiding
from the girls?

No. I, I came to thank you,
actually.

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:54.816
Glad to see you're all havin'
a wonderful time here tonight.

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.818
I, uh, I wanna take
this opportunity

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.455
to just... put a spotlight

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:03.725
on a couple
of very, very special girls.

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:08.463
Uh, this pint-sized ball of fire
is a giant on the stage

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:12.267
and I, for one, think she has
a tremendously bright future.

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:15.336
Give it up
for our fearless rookie,

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:17.805
Josie Parker!

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.375
Whoo! Go, Josie! You rock!

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:23.411
[audience cheering]

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:28.283
Thank you, everybody.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:30.551
[audience cheering]

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:32.487
[Bob] All right.

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:36.624
And how could we forget
about this next young gal

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.627
who consistently
exceeds expectations

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.497
each and every year?

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:45.466
Give it up
for our Miss Next winner

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:49.370
for a record-tying
third straight time,

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:52.307
Miss Cindy Stallings!

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:55.310
[audience applauding]

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:01.449
Wow. This is such a surprise.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:04.519
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.854
I just wanted to say
that it takes

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.624
a lot of hard work and courage.

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:13.328
And everybody in this room
made this possible by driving me

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.730
to be even better
than I thought I could be.

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:18.366
Thank you.

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:19.867
[audience cheering]

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.771
[vocalization]

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:33.815
Hey, Lucy, so I've been thinkin'
about all that you said,

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:36.551
well, haven't said, I guess.

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:37.719
I've been wondering
why I liked the fact that

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:38.953
you don't talk too much.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:40.822
The answer's simple.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:43.458
If I ask you out and say
that you're my girlfriend,

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.527
you won't say no.
So, there you have it.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.897
You're my girl now.
Here, let me get this for you.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.466
<i>♪ So nervous ♪</i>

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:53.701
<i>♪ You make me so careless ♪</i>

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.671
<i>♪ You bring out
the worst in me ♪</i>

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:58.606
<i>♪ We know it
'cause you're just young... ♪</i>

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:00.141
Thanks, girls.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:02.410
Next year
it could be you up there.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:04.846
But this is our last year.

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:06.714
Whatevs.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.684
So, I was thinking,
since it is our last night

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:13.454
at the Performing Arts camp,
let's go out with a bang.

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:14.589
What do you mean?

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.724
I think somebody needs to get

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.393
hot and spicy.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:20.728
- What? No!
- Yes, yes, yes!

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.730
Come on, it'll be so funny.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.932
[sighs] Who?

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:30.671
Just leave her alone, Cindy.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:33.541
You already won Miss Next.
She's not botherin' anybody.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:36.677
One little
end-of-the-year prank.

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:37.945
[chuckles] Come on!

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.952
Becky, you do the honors.

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:46.721
I wanna capture this moment
on my phone

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.623
so this special moment
lives forever.

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:50.691
I really don't think
we should do this.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:53.828
I'm sorry.
Did you say, "Think?"

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:58.933
No offense, Becks, but thinking
isn't really your thing.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.803
Now, if you wanna hang out
with me at all this summer,

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.971
I suggest you hurry up
and get this done.

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:16.684
Yay. You're back.

01:14:17.554 --> 01:14:18.920
What's up, Kelly?

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:23.524
Why are you recording me
on your phone?

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:25.593
I just wanted to capture
this beautiful evening

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:28.529
so I can remember all my girls
for the rest of my life.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:31.833
And I have to be honest, Kelly.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.768
Out of all the girls here,

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:35.870
you're definitely
the hottest one.

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:37.939
[Cindy chuckles]

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:42.877
I said, you're the hottest one!

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:50.051
[sighs] I said,
you're the hottest...

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.956
- [all gasping]
- Oh, my God!

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:57.091
- [all laughing]
- [boy 1] Oh, my God!

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:05.032
What was that?

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:08.569
Sorry, Cindy.
I guess I wasn't thinking.

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:10.905
[clatters]

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:14.575
Huh...

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:20.047
Uh...

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:23.618
[exhales sharply]

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.856
What's up, Becky?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.894
[sighs] Uh, hey.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:36.831
I, um, I'm really sorry

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.133
I was so mean to you before.

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:43.004
And I just wanted to say
you're an amazing performer

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:45.940
and I really appreciate what
you said to me on Show Night.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.043
And I really appreciate

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.813
that you just threw a bowl of
salsa on Cindy Stallings' head.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:54.749
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:57.885
I'm pretty sure everybody's
pretty excited about that.

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:03.024
Is it strange
that despite everything,

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:05.626
I'm really gonna miss
this place?

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:08.763
No, I think strange is
a pretty solid word for tonight.

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:11.899
- [Lucy] <i> Hi.</i>
- Hey, what's goin' on?

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.035
[Kelly] I don't know.
Let's go check it out.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:18.773
My name is... Lucy Rizzo.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:22.910
I've been comin' here
for five years,

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:26.347
but I've never really performed
or danced or,

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:30.184
or done much of anything,
really.

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:32.954
I think
it's about to get stranger.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.622
Um, I'm only here

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:38.659
because my mom
was a famous dancer

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:41.996
and my parents pay
a lot of money, so...

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:46.067
Um, anyway, um,

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:49.070
since this is my last year

01:16:49.072 --> 01:16:52.139
and I might not ever be
up on a stage

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:54.108
again in my life,

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.645
I thought
I would just give it a shot.

01:16:57.647 --> 01:17:00.848
So this is a little dance

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:05.720
that I used to dance
with my mom, so...

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:08.990
- Here I go.
- You go, Lucy!

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:10.825
That's my girlfriend.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.293
[chuckling]

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.134
Thank you. Uh...

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.210
Is this seat taken?

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:50.351
Did you see what they did to me?

01:19:50.353 --> 01:19:51.886
I did.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.855
The old hot and spicy.

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:56.190
Some things never change.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:20:00.060
I also saw the way you treated
a lot of these girls

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:01.862
the past few weeks.

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:06.200
I was just trying
to get in their heads.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:10.337
[sighs] Be a winner
and all that.

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.041
You remind me a lot of myself.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:17.211
When I first started
in the competitive song

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:20.114
and dance world,
I didn't want any friends.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:22.283
I treated everyone
like competition.

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:24.151
And you know what?

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:27.154
It showed in my music.
I was angry and tough.

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.190
And it lacked heart.

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:33.027
But the moment
I let that anger go

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:34.929
and realized
that music can bind us together

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.130
instead of tear us apart,

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:40.234
I started writing material that
really connected with people.

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:45.372
I think
you have a lot of talent.

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.844
It'd be a shame to waste it.

01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:58.252
[door opens]

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:03.958
- Kelly!
- What do you want, Conor?

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.326
You haven't answered
any of my texts,

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:08.062
and you've ignored me all night.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:10.064
- I don't get it.
- Why don't you go ask Cindy?

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:13.067
Cindy? Your weird roommate?

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:14.969
Why would I ask her?

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.403
Stop playing, Conor.

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:18.372
- I know you like her.
- What?

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:21.942
I saw you hugging her
and whatever.

01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:23.477
You're so two-faced.

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:26.881
No, she, she called me
to talk about you.

01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:30.150
So I went to your room,
and then she hugged me

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:31.485
for a straight five minutes.

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:34.021
It was really creepy.

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:38.492
- W-why are you smilin'?
- [chuckles]

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:41.328
- You are so lucky.
- How am I lucky?

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:43.964
Because Cindy is such a creep

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:46.166
that I actually believe you.

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:48.969
[laughs]

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.672
So you thought me and Cindy...

01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:53.941
She set me up, okay?

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:56.977
It looked pretty bad
from where I was standing.

01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:59.980
Okay. So this all
sort of makes sense now.

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:02.383
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:05.686
Hey, you wanna go make fun
of the way I dance?

01:22:05.688 --> 01:22:08.289
- It's pretty terrible.
- [chuckles] I would love to.

It was, uh...
It was a good, good, uh...

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.469
- Little surprise up there.
- Thanks.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:26.974
I was thinkin' it might be good
to expand the Next Level.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.345
To, well, the next level.

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:34.548
- What do you mean?
- Jasmine's experiment.

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:37.985
What if we started admitting
boys at Next Level as well?

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:41.455
You know, round out the group,
keep us girls on our toes.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.390
Yeah, you know...

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:47.461
I think that might be
a great idea.

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:50.230
I'm a genius!

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:52.232
You're a what?

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:57.104
Okay, guys, so I was behind you.

01:22:57.106 --> 01:22:58.305
And all of a sudden,
Cindy walked up

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.074
and I just threw the salsa
over her.

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:01.976
I don't even know what
came over me. I was just like...

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:03.310
I just did it.
It was, it was insane.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:06.046
- I, like... I did a YOLO!
- You did a YOLO.

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:08.749
- I did a YOLO or YOLO-ed?
- YOLO is just saying that...

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:11.185
We used to say
when we were little...

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.988
You probably don't know.
You know, like, you need to...

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.322
[indistinct chatter]

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:17.324

- What?

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:21.095
Come on, girls.

01:23:21.097 --> 01:23:24.098
You can't have salsa
without nachos.

01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:31.105
[all laughing]

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:35.175
Okay, I hate to give you credit,
but that one was pretty funny.

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.412
I'm sorry, everyone,

01:23:39.482 --> 01:23:42.616
about... everything.

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:46.120
Whoa! Did you just say
something kind?

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:49.490
I think she might be suffering
from salsa trauma.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:24:00.167
I'm sorry, too,
I guess I was just tired

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:02.336
of being pushed around
all the time.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:06.140
[Kelly] Look at us, it's
our last night at Next Level

01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:09.243
and we're all finally friends.

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:12.513

to perform in public anymore.

you would've beaten me

fair and square?

You're such a complainer.

Hey, missy,
I've had it with your sass.

01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:01.875
I'm not your servant.
I'm your mother.

01:33:01.877 --> 01:33:04.611

to be spoken to that way.

01:33:04.613 --> 01:33:05.845
Fine.

01:33:05.847 --> 01:33:07.681
You need to get control
of your daughter.

01:33:07.683 --> 01:33:09.015
I mean,
who taught you to parent?

01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:10.884
- You know what?
- I mean, if this were my kid...

01:33:10.886 --> 01:33:12.118
I'd be washin' her mouth out
with soap.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.653
I would never let her--

01:33:13.655 --> 01:33:16.056
I actually think
this may stem from you.

01:33:16.058 --> 01:33:19.926

It's that they're afraid of you.
