The Golden Girls...

00:43.200 --> 00:46.533
I'm going out tonight, with Stan.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.934
-No!
-Yes Ma, I really am.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.667
I believe you, I said no!

00:54.233 --> 00:55.467
Oh, what's the matter honey?

00:55.533 --> 00:57.100
Did you have a bad time with Ray?

00:57.166 --> 00:58.633
It wasn't Ray.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.100
His ex-wife Myra,
ran into the Chowderheads

01:02.166 --> 01:04.567
where we were eating
and started yelling at me.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.000
I tried to convince Myra
that he's just a friend

01:07.066 --> 01:08.400
but she won't listen.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.600
For some reason
she won't accept the divorce.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.500
I really feel threatened.

01:12.567 --> 01:13.600
Ma...

01:15.533 --> 01:18.333
Ma, Stan gave me an
engagement ring.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.300
I see. Excuse me.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.800
You marry this man,
and we're no longer family.

01:29.734 --> 01:33.767
You do this...
you are out of my life forever!

01:35.667 --> 01:40.367
(serene music playing)

01:59.433 --> 02:02.533
Dorothy, I don't know
if you'll recognize him

02:02.600 --> 02:04.233
without his leather apron,
but this is Errol.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.967
He's our shoe repair guy.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.900
I told him you're dying to
go out with him.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.333
Errol, sorry you made
the trip for nothing.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.133
My mother refuses to accept

02:14.200 --> 02:16.867
that I'm getting married
in three days.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.500
So, what are you doing tonight?

02:20.934 --> 02:22.500
Goodbye, Errol.

02:23.567 --> 02:24.734
Ma!

02:24.800 --> 02:25.767
He's perfect for you.

02:25.834 --> 02:27.834
He knows your shoe size,
and he doesn't care.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.967
Why didn't somebody
wake me up?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.433
The last time I walked into
your bedroom unannounced,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.867
some guy missed the trampoline
and almost killed me.

02:41.967 --> 02:43.500
That's exactly
the kind of thing

02:43.567 --> 02:45.033
I don't want you to say
this afternoon

02:45.100 --> 02:47.633
when we're interviewing
new roommates.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.767
It would be so much easier if she
didn't have to meet you people.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.834
I hope you find
somebody soon.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.633
Actually, you're going
to need two new tenants.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.200
I'm not living
with you and Stan.

02:58.266 --> 03:00.967
Yes you are, Ma. I want you with us.

03:01.033 --> 03:03.400
And besides,
you can't afford to live alone.

03:03.467 --> 03:04.934
Blanche is letting me
keep my room.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.767
I have an interview
with McDonald's today.

03:06.834 --> 03:09.767
If I can see over the counter,
I'm their new fry girl.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.767
-Oh...
-Rose, what happened?

03:15.834 --> 03:19.500
My brakes went out,
and the car wouldn't stop.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.934
My whole life flashed
before my eyes,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.667
and the Nuderflaken twins

03:23.734 --> 03:27.166
played a bigger part
than I had realized.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.166
That must
have been awful.

03:29.233 --> 03:33.567
Oh, it was. I don't know
any Nuderflaken twins.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.567
The mind is a powerful thing.

03:37.633 --> 03:40.333
Think of the 99% you don't use.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.166
Anyway, I stopped at a gas station.

03:44.233 --> 03:45.900
They gave me a ride home.

03:45.967 --> 03:49.066
Oh, by the way, Chuck says yo.

03:50.233 --> 03:52.800
Chuck from Arco
or Chuck from Shell?

03:52.867 --> 03:54.166
Shell.

03:54.233 --> 03:58.533
Big Chuck from Shell
or little Chuck from Shell?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.200
Blanche, I think you're
spending too much time

04:01.266 --> 04:02.800
at the full-service island.

04:06.033 --> 04:09.767
Boy, I think Myra
tampered with my brakes.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.967
Ever since I went to dinner
with her ex-husband,

04:12.033 --> 04:13.934
she's been out to get me.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.433
-(telephone rings)
-Oh!

04:18.500 --> 04:20.900
What if that's Myra? I--

04:20.967 --> 04:23.100
(ring)

04:24.834 --> 04:26.367
Hello?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.934
Hello?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.867
I can hear you breathing,
you devil!

04:30.934 --> 04:32.033
Why are you doing this to me?

04:32.100 --> 04:34.233
Here, here, here.
Just calm down.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.967
Let me handle this.

04:36.033 --> 04:38.400
Hello. This is Blanche...

04:39.533 --> 04:42.600
oh, Chuck. Yo!
Uh-huh.

04:45.800 --> 04:50.133
(mellow music playing)

04:50.200 --> 04:52.800
Oh, Dorothy,
push the doorbell.

04:52.867 --> 04:55.400
-The door's open.
-I know, but push it anyway.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
-(doorbell rings)
-(dogs barking)

05:04.900 --> 05:06.400
This is really amazing, Rose.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.000
Just the other day,
I was thinking,

05:08.066 --> 05:10.100
"Why doesn't our doorbell bark?"

05:12.900 --> 05:16.467
It's probably because
we didn't have a bark bell.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.166
I got it to keep Myra away.

05:18.233 --> 05:19.900
You really think
this is going to work?

05:19.967 --> 05:22.266
Oh, yeah. Look at the box.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.567
See how the burglar's running
away from the house?

05:25.633 --> 05:27.834
And he's saying, "Yikes!"

05:29.200 --> 05:30.900
Oh, here, honey.
This is for you.

05:30.967 --> 05:32.033
I'm afraid to open it.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.000
-What if it's from Myra?
-Oh, come on, Rose.

05:35.066 --> 05:37.233
What if it's got a deadly
black spider in it

05:37.300 --> 05:40.100
that's going to bite me
when I open it?

05:49.433 --> 05:50.533
There you are.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.066
You're wise. You're just wise.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.100
Oh, good, you're both here.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.767
I interviewed
a very sweet lady on the phone

06:01.834 --> 06:03.400
to be our roommate.
She'll be here soon.

06:03.467 --> 06:07.266
When she gets here,
please pretend to be nice.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.233
Well, this is good news.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.567
You've already turned down
about 12 people.

06:11.633 --> 06:14.867
They were either too thin,
too pretty, or too young,

06:14.934 --> 06:16.133
like you only want to live

06:16.200 --> 06:20.066
with a woman who has absolutely
no sex appeal whatsoever.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.233
You think we're dogs,
don't you?

06:35.133 --> 06:36.967
-(doorbell rings)
-(dogs barking)

06:45.467 --> 06:47.433
Now, that's too eerie.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.567
The dogs are on my tail again.
Run through the river.

06:52.633 --> 06:56.834
Ma, we've just
put in a new bell.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.433
It's to scare people.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.867
It'll never work.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.467
-Hello. Are you Truby?
-Yes. Blanche?

07:05.533 --> 07:07.633
-Yes. Come on in.
-Oh, thanks.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.100
-Meet everybody. That's Rose--
-Hello.

07:10.166 --> 07:13.667
That's Dorothy.
That's Sophia.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.800
-Won't you sit down?
-Yes, thanks.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.467
Well, who's the lucky bride?

07:18.533 --> 07:21.400
You must be referring to the
once and future Mrs. Yutz.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.200
My husband passed
just last summer.

07:26.266 --> 07:28.533
Oh...

07:28.600 --> 07:29.834
Passed what?

07:39.800 --> 07:42.166
A slow-moving Winnebago.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.033
Oh, I hate when I get stuck
behind one of those.

07:50.433 --> 07:53.533
He's dead, sweetie.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.300
But, hey, I'm used to it.
I put three in the ground.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.000
Well, what can I tell you?

07:59.066 --> 08:03.033
I like them old, rich,
and barely breathing.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.600
Why don't I show you
the rest of the house?

08:05.667 --> 08:08.867
May I ask how old you are?

08:08.934 --> 08:11.700
Oh, about as old as you are.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.867
To lose a husband that young...

08:20.133 --> 08:22.567
Ok... places!

08:26.000 --> 08:28.667
(humming "The Wedding March")

08:32.166 --> 08:35.867
Remember, teeny steps. We're
not Godzilla attacking the city.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.333
Ok.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.367
Dearly beloved,

08:46.433 --> 08:50.100
we're gathered here today to join
Dorothy and Stanley in blah, blah,

08:50.166 --> 08:52.767
followed by rings,
and into the vows.

08:56.734 --> 09:01.333
"Dorothy, I vow to you
that my love is pure."

09:04.900 --> 09:06.233
"I do vow too."

09:09.533 --> 09:12.567
"I vow that my love is strong."

09:12.633 --> 09:14.133
"I do vow too."

09:16.533 --> 09:19.333
"I vow that I will love no other."

09:19.400 --> 09:22.900
"I do--" my God, Stanley,
I feel like one of the Shirelles.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.700
"And most of all,

09:27.767 --> 09:31.467
I vow that my marriage
to my beloved Dorothy--"

09:31.533 --> 09:36.066
Stop. With God as my witness in
front of this entire congregation,

09:36.133 --> 09:38.266
I call an end to this wedding!

09:38.333 --> 09:40.667
Sophia, this is only the rehearsal.

09:41.834 --> 09:44.767
It is?
Pretend you didn't hear that.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.000
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:50.800 --> 09:55.633
(soft music playing)

09:55.700 --> 09:57.734
-(doorbell rings)
-(dogs barking)

10:02.433 --> 10:04.734
We're on the lanai.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.900
Rose, you've got to disconnect
those stupid dogs.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.433
But it's working.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.734
And besides,
I've already named them.

10:15.867 --> 10:18.300
Thanks for letting me
move in early.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.000
Great day for a wedding.

10:21.066 --> 10:24.600
Say, who tied those dead fish
to the back of the car?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.934
It's a St. Olaf tradition.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.333
You drive until you
can't stand the smell,

10:31.400 --> 10:33.000
and then that's where you live.

10:36.066 --> 10:37.567
Crazy or stupid?

10:37.633 --> 10:39.200
We think it's a mix.

10:49.100 --> 10:53.200
Hey, what's this?
I thought I canceled the flowers.

10:54.533 --> 10:56.900
I mean, it looks nice.

10:56.967 --> 10:59.967
You've got to stop this.
Now, you're hurting Dorothy.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.367
Don't you love her?

11:01.433 --> 11:02.433
Of course, I do.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.033
Then why are you doing this?

11:04.100 --> 11:06.834
She's making the biggest mistake
of her life.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.667
You don't know that.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.266
I know you're only
trying to protect her,

11:12.333 --> 11:15.200
but let me tell you
about a lesson I learned

11:15.266 --> 11:18.033
when I was a little girl
in St. Olaf.

11:18.533 --> 11:24.000
If you hold a bird gently,
the bird will stay.

11:24.066 --> 11:27.667
But if you squeeze the bird,
his eyes will bug out.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.600
And Mr. Pet shop owner
gets very huffy

11:37.667 --> 11:40.333
and won't let you
touch the birds anymore.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.533
And the mice, he won't let you in
the room with the mice--

11:44.600 --> 11:47.633
Rose, what is 8 times 6?

11:47.700 --> 11:49.567
Ok, now that
we have a few minutes...

11:57.400 --> 11:59.700
I think Rose made
two very good points,

11:59.767 --> 12:01.934
one, not all psychotics
are dangerous,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.800
and two, honey,
you have to let go.

12:04.867 --> 12:07.433
Dorothy's capable of
making her own decisions.

12:07.934 --> 12:10.166
Does any of this make
sense to you, Sophia?

12:11.567 --> 12:12.834
Not completely.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.867
I still think Rose has the capacity
to kill.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.967
Oh, Rose. Sorry, honey,
pencils down.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.166
I could have used
a pencil?

12:31.066 --> 12:34.166
Oh, you just look so beautiful.

12:34.233 --> 12:37.000
You know, this reminds me
of the day I married George.

12:37.066 --> 12:39.200
Oh, it was an exquisite wedding.

12:39.266 --> 12:41.700
Five hundred people
in that big, old church,

12:41.767 --> 12:43.767
and I didn't have
any underwear on.

12:46.567 --> 12:47.533
Why?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.700
I just felt it was
the right thing to do.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.533
My wedding was outdoors.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.567
February 12th,
I'll never forget it.

12:56.633 --> 13:01.900
Oh, I wore the most beautiful
white flannel wedding gown.

13:01.967 --> 13:04.667
It even had feet sewn in.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.433
Oh, when Stan and I were married...

13:09.500 --> 13:11.767
Stan was crying,
I was crying.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.100
Ma was crying.
All for different reasons,

13:14.166 --> 13:17.333
but if you didn't know us,
it looked touching.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.166
I'm getting married again.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.000
I've done this before.
Why am I so nervous?

13:24.066 --> 13:28.066
I'm always nervous at weddings,
weddings and funerals.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.500
I've been to so many of both,
I get mixed up.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.300
Same guest list,
same flowers.

13:32.367 --> 13:35.633
Handful of rice, handful of dirt.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.233
The only difference is,
after the funeral, it's ok to date.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.533
I'm beginning to like her.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.400
Me too.

13:50.467 --> 13:53.600
You're going to have
a lot of fun together.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.767
Aw, Dorothy,
nobody can replace you.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.100
Dorothy, I can't believe it.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.633
You're going to walk down
that aisle,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.700
and you won't be home tonight.

14:02.767 --> 14:06.133
Oh, I'm going to
miss you so much.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.934
The only thing that makes me
sad is leaving you and ma.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.066
Come on now.
We got to get you ready.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.533
-Do you have something blue?
-Do veins count?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.800
Oh...

14:20.567 --> 14:23.133
I want you to have this hankie
from St. Olaf.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.433
It's got a little blue embroidery
on it.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.400
"Sneeze here."

14:29.834 --> 14:31.500
And you need
something new.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.834
I have this other handkerchief
from St. Olaf.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.500
This one's never been used.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.166
Thanks again, Rose.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.934
And something borrowed.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.867
Dorothy, I want you
to have my best bracelet.

14:43.934 --> 14:46.333
Oh, Blanche, that's very sweet.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.033
It's just borrowing it,
you know.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.100
-I'll need it back.
-Ok.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.967
Slip it to me
right after the ceremony.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.867
-It's an antique.
-Give it to me.

14:57.367 --> 15:00.133
Dorothy, you're trembling.
Are you that scared?

15:00.200 --> 15:04.100
Yes, yes, I'm just as queasy
as I was at my first wedding,

15:04.166 --> 15:08.433
except that I'm pretty positive
this time it's not morning sickness.

15:11.100 --> 15:16.367
Oh, look, I'm probably just upset
because ma isn't going to be there.

15:16.433 --> 15:20.200
I just wish she could see Stan
the way I see him now.

15:20.266 --> 15:23.100
If she didn't love you,
she wouldn't be fighting so hard.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.767
I know.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.333
Let's see.
You got something borrowed,

15:27.400 --> 15:30.033
something blue, something new.
You need something old.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.166
Old enough?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.433
Oh, Ma...
oh, Ma...

15:40.166 --> 15:43.467
My little girl is getting married.

15:43.533 --> 15:47.500
Oh, Ma, I just wish you
weren't against this.

15:47.567 --> 15:50.166
Look how pretty you look.

15:50.233 --> 15:52.133
-Really?
-Yeah, beautiful.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.567
Remember the last time?

15:53.633 --> 15:55.900
We stayed up all night,
letting out that dress.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.066
Oh, Ma, you know
Stan has changed.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.667
I trust him now
for the very first time.

16:03.734 --> 16:06.533
Ma, I need your blessing.

16:06.600 --> 16:10.033
It's always hard to let your
children make their own decisions,

16:10.100 --> 16:13.200
but even though
I worry about you,

16:13.266 --> 16:16.433
you always do the right thing.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.533
-You have my blessing.
-Oh, Ma, thank you.

16:21.033 --> 16:22.266
You know, pussycat,

16:22.333 --> 16:26.867
we never had that mother-daughter
talk about sex.

16:26.934 --> 16:30.834
I've had sex more years
than I care to think about.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.266
I know.
I think you're doing it wrong.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.100
-(doorbell rings)
-(dogs barking)

16:40.066 --> 16:42.400
Sounds like the guests are arriving.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.633
Sophia.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.900
Alright. You've got a second chance,
but if you hurt my daughter again,

16:51.967 --> 16:54.467
I'll make you miserable
for the rest of my life.

16:54.533 --> 16:58.500
And if I lay off meat and dairy,
that could be as much as five years.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.300
-(doorbell rings)
-(dogs barking)

17:04.533 --> 17:06.300
I cannot take this
another minute.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.734
Oh...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.133
Oh, my God! It's Myra.

17:12.100 --> 17:14.734
This is who you've been
scared of?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.700
So you're Myra.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.400
Watch out.
She's dangerous.

17:18.467 --> 17:21.166
Ooh, I'm shaking.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.533
You get that too?

17:24.467 --> 17:26.266
What do you want, Myra?

17:26.333 --> 17:30.033
I just came to tell you I'm not
going to bother you anymore.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.934
You can have Ray,

17:32.000 --> 17:37.166
but you should know you're not the
only young blond bimbo in his life.

17:37.667 --> 17:41.166
I don't want your husband.
I never did.

17:41.233 --> 17:43.500
I understand that now.

17:43.567 --> 17:49.133
I think I was just afraid
of starting all over at my age.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.767
My daughter's checking me

17:50.834 --> 17:56.166
into a lovely retirement home
called Shady Pines.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.367
That's great.
Come on out to the lanai.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.266
I'll give you the lowdown
on Shady Pines,

18:01.333 --> 18:04.100
you know,
who does what for cigarettes.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.233
Here comes the
beautiful bride.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.800
Wow, look at you.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.667
You look perfect.

18:18.734 --> 18:20.033
Thank you.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.700
-Stanley, I'm a little scared.
-I'm not.

18:22.767 --> 18:25.533
I just feel this is so right.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.266
Stanley, I think we're going
to make it this time.

18:30.633 --> 18:32.333
Dorothy, I want you
to meet my best man

18:32.400 --> 18:33.600
Marvin Mitchelson.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.400
-Oh...
-Oh!

18:36.467 --> 18:37.367
Hello.

18:37.433 --> 18:41.100
Oh! How lovely to meet you.
What an honor.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.700
-The honor is mine, Dorothy.
-He's a lawyer.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.200
I know who he is.

18:46.266 --> 18:48.033
Oh, Stanley, I'm impressed.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.900
Yeah, well, since
I made all this money,

18:49.967 --> 18:52.367
you wouldn't believe
all the friends I have.

18:52.433 --> 18:54.734
How about this guy?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.934
Dorothy, you're every bit as lovely
as Stan said you were.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.900
Oh, why, thank you.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.066
Stanley.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.367
Yeah, right, listen,
Marv and I were talking,

19:06.433 --> 19:08.934
and you know how
persuasive he can be,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.033
and he said that I should

19:11.100 --> 19:14.200
and I thought that,
well, he's the lawyer,

19:14.266 --> 19:17.133
and that's what I'm paying
him for, so why don't you?

19:18.467 --> 19:19.867
Why don't I what?

19:19.934 --> 19:21.433
Just sign.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.133
It's nothing big.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.166
It's a little prenuptial agreement
that says...

19:27.867 --> 19:30.700
what's yours is yours,
and what's mine is mine.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.967
You want me to sign
a prenuptial agreement.

19:35.033 --> 19:39.800
You want me to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

19:39.867 --> 19:42.266
Stanley, whatever
happened to openness

19:42.333 --> 19:45.400
and honesty and trust,

19:45.467 --> 19:51.200
not to mention the 38 years that
I spent as your wife, your partner,

19:51.266 --> 19:54.400
the mother of your children,

19:54.467 --> 19:56.200
the woman
who held down two jobs

19:56.266 --> 19:58.500
while you were at home
staring at a matchbook,

19:58.567 --> 20:00.400
trying to draw winky?

20:03.233 --> 20:05.166
I told you she wouldn't go for it.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.767
I don't want your money.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.600
Marvin, give me the agreement.

20:10.033 --> 20:12.066
-(whap)
-Ouch!

20:14.367 --> 20:17.166
Weddings. Why do I always
get hit at these things?

20:17.233 --> 20:18.367
Get out, Stanley.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.567
Get out before I need a lawyer.

20:21.066 --> 20:23.133
I think you've got a case.

20:27.667 --> 20:30.600
But, Dorothy,
what about our guests,

20:30.667 --> 20:32.200
what about our
honeymoon in Aruba?

20:32.266 --> 20:33.500
Oh, I'd be too confused.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.467
Would I be using your money
or my money?

20:35.533 --> 20:39.133
-We could check with Marvin.
-I don't think so.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.667
But I love you. Do you
know what you're doing?

20:43.934 --> 20:47.600
Yes. Yes, I think
I'm doing the right thing.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.100
Please leave.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.300
I have an announcement
to make.

21:13.133 --> 21:17.000
I've decided not to make
the same mistake twice.

21:17.066 --> 21:18.333
I'm sorry.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.367
She turned him down.
Remember that.

21:28.467 --> 21:31.934
(calm music playing)

21:32.000 --> 21:34.033
If it's any consolation, Dorothy,

21:34.100 --> 21:37.533
what there was of your wedding
was very beautiful.

21:38.934 --> 21:40.934
And the album won't be
as bad as you think.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.066
The photographer
got some great shots

21:43.133 --> 21:45.700
of your friends leaving
with their gifts.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.066
I want to thank you
for not saying I told you so.

21:54.133 --> 21:57.333
When you're as right as I am,
you don't have to say it.

21:59.066 --> 22:01.500
Well, I finished unpacking.

22:01.567 --> 22:05.567
It's hard to get a lifeful of fun
into a substitute teacher's closet.

22:05.633 --> 22:07.633
Truby, honey, we have to talk.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.166
I know you signed a lease,

22:09.233 --> 22:12.500
but considering Dorothy's
tragic misfortune--

22:12.567 --> 22:16.600
I know, but could
I just stay a couple of days?

22:16.667 --> 22:18.867
I can't stand another
minute in a hotel.

22:18.934 --> 22:22.533
I know what you mean. If I have to
come up with one more fake name...

22:25.633 --> 22:28.300
Dorothy, I guess we're sleeping
together tonight.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.233
Ma, I have a better idea.

22:30.300 --> 22:34.500
In my suitcase,
there are two tickets to Aruba.

22:34.567 --> 22:37.400
I think Stan owes us
a little vacation, don't you?

22:37.467 --> 22:41.800
Aruba? I love Aruba.

22:41.867 --> 22:43.934
Where's Aruba?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.700
Ma, get going.
We have a plane to catch!

22:46.767 --> 22:47.600
We'll help.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.333
I have the very things
for you to take.

22:53.066 --> 22:57.600
Oh... this has always been
my worst nightmare.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.000
A wedding falling apart
at the last minute?

23:00.066 --> 23:03.000
No. Going on a honeymoon
with my mother.

23:13.967 --> 23:17.934
(theme music playing)
