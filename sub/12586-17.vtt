WEBVTT

00:41.166 --> 00:42.625
-

00:42.709 --> 00:45.587
Everybody, I have a listing.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.380
A listing?

00:47.464 --> 00:51.509
-Now, since the market is as tight
as an Englishman's cricket shoes,

00:51.593 --> 00:56.473
it's only fair this assignment go
to the employee I feel is most deserving.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.642
Me!

00:59.726 --> 01:00.727
Oh..

01:00.810 --> 01:02.437
Oh, and for the rest of you,

01:02.520 --> 01:06.232
if you're lucky enough to get a listing,
well, you'll now get two weeks to sell it.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.860
And if you don't, it goes back
to my top sales person...

01:09.778 --> 01:11.863
-Still me.
-Ohh...

01:16.659 --> 01:18.953
No, you don't!

01:21.247 --> 01:22.207
Sizemore Realty!

01:22.290 --> 01:26.252
This is Peggy Hill speaking!
But you can call me your realtor.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.635
Mashed potatoes and French fries?

01:33.718 --> 01:36.846
If it's bad news, Mom,
just let me have it.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.100
Let the starches flow like water!
I have a listing!

01:40.183 --> 01:41.851
-Way to go!
-Way to go, Aunt Peggy!

01:41.935 --> 01:43.228
Well, all right, Peggy.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.606
That's a pretty big deal considering
the rough housing market.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.774
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.651
But I only have two weeks
to sell the house

01:49.734 --> 01:52.403
or I will lose the listing
and maybe my job.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.532
No, no. You enjoy those fries, Bobby.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.535
Because I plan on staging the heck
out of this house.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.078
What's staging?

02:00.161 --> 02:01.746
It's like a home makeover.

02:01.830 --> 02:05.416
I fill the house with flowers, candles,
and nice furniture

02:05.500 --> 02:07.377
so people won't have a chance to imagine

02:07.460 --> 02:09.712
how bad it's gonna look
with their crap in it.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.298
I know what'll attract a big crowd!

02:12.382 --> 02:15.510
You can put in a Gap! People love The Gap.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.561
The last hose you'll ever buy!

02:24.644 --> 02:26.688
I've had to buy it three times!

02:26.771 --> 02:30.525
And I'm buying it again!
This is gonna be the one!

02:31.234 --> 02:33.027
Oh, God. Look who's here.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.113
That home inspector, Bud Ferguson.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.781
Where? Where is he?

02:40.577 --> 02:45.165
Bud Ferguson pushing a shopping cart
like a mere mortal!

02:45.248 --> 02:47.792
That jerk killed two
of our sales last month

02:47.876 --> 02:50.920
because the houses had
"structural problems."

02:51.004 --> 02:52.922
Like every house doesn't have those.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.634
It's Ferguson's job to be tough.
And he's darn good at it.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.388
Did you know he discovered faulty wiring
at Beau Chute's house

03:00.471 --> 03:02.640
through three layers of drywall?

03:02.724 --> 03:03.850
Of course we do.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.395
You fail a Ferguson inspection,
everyone in Arlen knows.

03:07.478 --> 03:11.316
Poor Chute was so humiliated
he had to move to a Dakota.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.902
His unsalable house still sits empty.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.196
Sad for him, sad for the house.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.208
I will sell this house by 1 p.m.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.442
Your open house starts in an hour.

03:54.525 --> 03:58.863
So what do you say you jump in the car
and go for a little spin around the state?

04:00.031 --> 04:03.201
Even if I was physically capable
of getting into an automobile,

04:03.284 --> 04:06.412
I ain't going nowhere with outsiders
in the house.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.289
They'll steal our stuffs.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.462
The open house was a disaster.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.422
That woman, she kept kissing

04:16.506 --> 04:17.924
her ferret on the mouth!

04:18.007 --> 04:19.759
I don't know who I felt worse for!

04:19.842 --> 04:22.637
Oh! Ugly people sure do ruin a lot.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.265
They've done studies with newborns.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.893
And if given the choice, babies
would rather go to pretty strangers

04:28.977 --> 04:30.395
than their own ugly parents.

04:30.478 --> 04:34.732
Well, obviously, babies are
not as stupid as they look. That's it!

04:34.816 --> 04:37.568
Nancy, that's what I need.
Beautiful people!

04:37.652 --> 04:40.446
If I populate the open house
with beautiful people,

04:40.530 --> 04:42.365
no one will notice the ugly ones!

04:43.449 --> 04:45.994
And who are the best looking people
in town?

04:46.077 --> 04:49.789
Well, librarians after they take off
their glasses and actors.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.208
I will go with the actors!

04:59.716 --> 05:03.720
Welcome, cast members of
the 142 Taylor Avenue open house.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.807
Right now you are a random assortment
of very good looking actors.

05:08.933 --> 05:13.229
But by next weekend's open house,
you will be a family.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.732
Sounds great. I hate my real family.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.152
So Madame Director,
what do you want us to do?

05:19.235 --> 05:23.156
Well. Huh... Um, why don't you act?

05:23.239 --> 05:26.492
If you want us to act, we need a script.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.412
We're not improv people.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.748
A script. Right, Melrose.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.916
Which means, I get to write one.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.669
I will write about how wonderful
the house is.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.755
People will fall in love with it.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.590
And bingo, it's sold.

05:40.673 --> 05:44.969
I'm just gonna have to dig deep into
my tortured soul to write this thing.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.512
I will call my mother.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.057
Frank, why don't you warm up the actors?

05:50.641 --> 05:53.102
All right, everybody. Let's warm up.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.646
Thirty-three minutes to cut a lawn.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.940
That's a personal best.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.361
LUANNE, BOBBY, and ACTORS:
Unique New York. Unique New York.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.071
-Unique New York.
-What the...

06:03.154 --> 06:04.822
Unique New York.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.449
Unique New York.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.701
-Unique New York.
-Hey, Dad, check it out!

06:08.785 --> 06:10.870
-New York...
-I'm an actor!

06:10.953 --> 06:12.830
Unique New York.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.382
Peggy, this is crazy.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.718
Using actors to sell houses
is a dumb idea.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.637
Hank, my job is on the line.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.472
I have to sell that freak house.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.391
And I have one week to write a script

06:31.474 --> 06:33.768
and get it up on its feet
before the open house.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.978
These actors are my only hope.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.232
But, Peggy, the boy, he's swaying.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.193
Hank, if, god forbid,
you were desperate to keep your job

06:42.276 --> 06:47.031
and had to peddle propane in
our living room, I would not object.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.951
All right, fine.

06:50.034 --> 06:53.913
But please don't ever compare acting
to propane again.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.375
Connections.

06:57.458 --> 07:02.630
This play is about how this house
has affected people's lives.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.216
Now let's do the scene between Luanne,

07:05.299 --> 07:08.136
her husband,
and emotionally distant father.

07:08.219 --> 07:12.473
And how they connect in this mid-century
kitchen with modern upgrades.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.934
I know this is way uncool.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.019
But can we do my scenes first?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.313
I've got a mattress commercial
this afternoon.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.733
-Oh, you got that?
-Good. Good.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.068
Okay, everybody.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.572
Let's do the scene in the walk-in
closet-slash-third bedroom.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.699
Okay, in this scene, Frank...

07:29.782 --> 07:34.954
Peggy, I know writer's word is gold.
But do I have to say this?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.373
"French doors"?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.626
"Doors" is fine. It's the other word.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.463
Okay. I do not know
what the French did to you.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506
But I will work around them.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.553
Fine. Kitchen scene. Hustle!

07:53.014 --> 07:54.640
Oh, God.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.808
Stay where you are, Hank.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.895
The actors have to get used
to working around the freaky people.

07:58.978 --> 08:03.858
Everybody, pretend Hank is a scary
old man with an oxygen tank.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.202
Girls, I've got good news and bad news.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.205
I'll start with the bad.
Your mother is dead.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.123
-Oh, no!
-Mother!

08:19.207 --> 08:22.668
But the good news is that
her memory will live on in this house.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.380
Its sturdy frame, just like hers,
and large bay windows,

08:26.464 --> 08:30.134
like your mother's big blue eyes
that will never open again...

08:32.261 --> 08:33.596
Father!

08:38.267 --> 08:39.894
Dangit, Dale. I told you

08:39.977 --> 08:41.312
the bed is off limits.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.732
"Don't sit on my bed."
"Don't try on my belts."

08:44.815 --> 08:47.193
You sure have a lot of rules, King Don't.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.361
Knock it off, Dale.

08:48.444 --> 08:52.114
I got enough problems with these actors
crawling all over my house.

08:52.198 --> 08:56.452
Eating imaginary bananas when real ones
are sitting right there in a bowl.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.080
I don't know what I'd do
if I had actors in my house.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.958
We'd probably play charades
late into the night.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.711
Then get drunk on sangria and practice
our Oscar speeches.

09:05.795 --> 09:10.550
I could rid you of your extremely
attractive pests, Hank.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.637
I won't say when. I will say scorpions.

09:16.597 --> 09:20.977
I'm not sure if it's the high
ceilings or the recessed lighting.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.939
-But this room makes me...
-It's a miracle, my love!

09:25.022 --> 09:26.607
Cut!

09:26.774 --> 09:29.402
Luanne, you entered too early again.

09:29.485 --> 09:33.030
Bobby says, "Makes me want to dance."
He dances.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.657
Then you rush in.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.992
Come on, people!

09:36.075 --> 09:39.537
We have got one week to get this right
or I will lose my job!

09:40.913 --> 09:42.206
Action!

09:42.290 --> 09:44.750
It's a miracle, my love!

09:44.834 --> 09:48.087
After fifteen years, we are pregnant.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.339
And I know exactly who's responsible...

09:51.090 --> 09:52.425
this house.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.014
Chris? What are you doing here?

09:58.097 --> 09:59.974
Interrupting my knitting group?

10:00.057 --> 10:01.851
I know what you're doing here.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.520
Using actors to sell houses.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.690
Brilliant.

10:07.773 --> 10:11.444
You're making real estate history, Peggy.
And I want to be a part of it.

10:11.527 --> 10:15.197
More specifically, I want a part in it.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.699
He's not even hot.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.035
It wouldn't be fair to just throw you in.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.204
See, these are professional actors.

10:22.830 --> 10:27.209
"All love the womb that
their first being bred.

10:27.293 --> 10:33.215
Then give my tongue like leave
to love my head."

10:34.884 --> 10:36.469
Well, you're my boss.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.681
Another guy, great.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.475
There goes my chimney monologue.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.603
Fine! I'll rewrite the freaking thing!

10:52.777 --> 10:55.071
You guys are still up?

10:55.154 --> 10:56.656
It's 11:30.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.909
Dad, Mom's been typing
for six hours straight...

10:59.992 --> 11:04.205
except for that fifteen minutes
when she just started crying.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.958
Hank, it is impossible
to please all my actors.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.879
But I just did!

11:11.962 --> 11:13.673
Oh, forgot to save.

11:18.969 --> 11:23.641
I was hoping you'd take the house back,
and maybe your old dad too?

11:23.724 --> 11:26.936
<i>I missed you so much,
Dad. Hug me.</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:29.689
Where is Melrose?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.025
<i>I'm calling from the set.</i>

11:33.109 --> 11:34.735
On the phone?

11:34.819 --> 11:37.279
Wait, okay. I can handle this.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.242
You are on the phone
because you are away at school.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.828
Melrose is away at college

11:43.911 --> 11:47.998
and is calling because she misses
her family. No, her home.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.208
Frank, go with it!

11:50.584 --> 11:53.003
Um, I know you're trying
to break the cycle

11:53.087 --> 11:55.840
of being the first one in the family
to graduate college.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.341
But we miss you.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.469
And more importantly,
the house misses you.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.188
Did everyone feel that? It was real.
And it was good.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.357
<i>I could even feel it here, Frank.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:16.652
Oh, my goodness!

12:16.736 --> 12:18.988
Well, we might actually pull this off.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.408
At this rate, tomorrow's dress rehearsal
is gonna be fantastic.

12:22.491 --> 12:26.537
Now, everybody, remember to bring friends
so it feels like a real open house.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.999
I love the theater! It's in me now!

12:31.292 --> 12:33.002
Spencer, the talk.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.881
Bobby, did you know I'm 35-years-old,

12:36.964 --> 12:40.551
and I spend my weekends in a sandwich
costume just to make rent?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.987
This is the story of a family.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.531
But it's not about the people
in the family.

13:02.615 --> 13:06.118
Nay, it's a story about
what keeps them together.

13:06.202 --> 13:10.039
This is the story of a house.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.373
Good lord.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.295
They told me you died in the war.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.463
I did.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.966
I saw the white light,
God, the whole nine.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.969
But while there,
I couldn't stop thinking about home.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.013
So I couldn't stay dead.

13:26.096 --> 13:30.392
You can start the party!
Cousin Joey has arrived!

13:30.476 --> 13:33.646
I didn't knock because I never do.

13:37.191 --> 13:43.405
Which is why doctors will never tell you
that homesick is the worst kind of sick.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.865
And one day,

13:44.949 --> 13:51.497
I will honor this house by becoming
the man she always knew I could be.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.012
Brava, Peggy. Brava!

14:07.096 --> 14:09.598
Again, this play idea, genius!

14:09.682 --> 14:11.559
I, however, have surpassed that genius

14:11.642 --> 14:15.771
and gone on to create a new level of
genius by inviting a client to the show.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.982
Oh, good. You are my target audience.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.525
Come on, how much did you love it?

14:19.608 --> 14:22.319
It was great. So great,
I made an offer on the house.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.739
I don't understand.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.200
I sold you a house that
you've never even seen?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.119
No, Peggy. That would make you a witch.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.871
He made an offer on this house.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.624
What? But this is my house.
It's not for sale.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.585
Even at 25K over asking price?

14:37.668 --> 14:40.462
-With a full cash deposit?
-Sold!

14:49.179 --> 14:51.891
I can't believe you've sold our house!

14:51.974 --> 14:54.560
I know! And for a very good price.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.646
Twenty-five K over asking in
a down market.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.567
Would you open it, Dad?
You know, autographs.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.777
Has this family gone insane?

15:03.861 --> 15:06.780
That's it! Bobby, open your own dang soda.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.575
Peggy, we're not moving. End of story.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.122
I am sorry, Hank.

15:15.205 --> 15:19.460
When I sold our house, I was drunk
on the powerful elixir that is fame.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.253
But we cannot back out of this sale.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.922
It will destroy my reputation,

15:23.005 --> 15:25.966
which after tonight,
is off the freaking charts.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.637
Well, that's just too bad.
I'm not selling this house, Peggy.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.932
But, Hank, there will be
a huge penalty if we back out.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
It could be ten thousand dollars.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.562
I'm not paying anything!
You have to get us out of this.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.980
End of discussion.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.567
Okay, Hank.
I will find a way to keep our house.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.447
Actors got us into this.
Actors will get us out.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.577
I do appreciate you letting me
see the place during the day.

15:53.661 --> 15:57.331
Pst. Yo, your loan payment's "L"
to the "ate."

15:57.414 --> 16:01.877
If you don't cough up the scrilla,
you'll have to answer to the Jets.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.467
Hey, I just moved in down the block.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.346
And I'm required by law to tell everybody
I'm a sex offender.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.432
Good lord!

16:15.516 --> 16:18.394
Just ignore them. They're actors.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.604
Sir, I'm gonna level with you.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.314
This is all a big mistake.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.191
Our home is not for sale.

16:24.274 --> 16:28.654
I have no interest in selling the house
where I raised my boy and my dog.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.992
See now? This is exactly
the kind of life I want.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.911
No! This is my life and you can't have it.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.999
Kill the train, Bobby.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.380
I'm gonna get some sleep.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.632
Unless you plan on selling the bed.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.761
You will regret that dig because I have
figured out a way to get out of the sale

16:52.845 --> 16:55.681
and protect my reputation
as super realtor.

16:56.432 --> 17:00.269
All we have to do
is not pass the inspection.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.313
There's no way this house
will fail an inspection.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.317
Sure it can. If we stage it
to make it look damaged.

17:07.401 --> 17:11.071
And our inspector is Ferguson.
So it will be easy to fail.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.116
Ferguson?
Your reputation can take the hit!

17:14.199 --> 17:17.286
Because there's no goddang way
I'm looking like a fool

17:17.369 --> 17:20.664
in front of the greatest inspector
of our generation.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.251
Hank, there isn't any other way.
We can't afford the penalty.

17:28.422 --> 17:32.051
Master craftsman versus master inspector.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.927
I wonder if you'll fight to the death.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.848
So we're definitely not gonna be friends
with Ferguson?

17:37.931 --> 17:39.933
Maybe we can be frienemies.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.144
A love/hate relationship's
the next best thing.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.604
I'm sorry, Bill.

17:43.687 --> 17:47.649
We're not gonna be anything with Ferguson
after I fail his inspection,

17:47.733 --> 17:49.902
and everyone in Arlen hears about it.

17:49.985 --> 17:54.823
Problem remains. How will you fail?
Your house is perfection.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.241
Well, you got me.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.285
I've taken such good care of my home,

17:58.368 --> 18:00.579
I don't even know
what a bad one looks like.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.251
This beam's rotting.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.754
And over there,
you've got your termite damage.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.297
And look what I can do.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.052
How is that even possible?

18:15.135 --> 18:17.012
That's nothing compared to this.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.350
Put some brown around the edges

18:21.475 --> 18:23.936
so it looks like
it's progressed to phase two.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.688
And Bobby, when your mom's done
with the ladder,

18:26.772 --> 18:31.443
replace our air filter with, uh,
Mister Dauterive's.

18:31.527 --> 18:36.448
Dad, if it makes you feel better,
I don't want to be an actor anymore.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.575
Thank you, son.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.259
Look at this place.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.845
My whole life has been a lie.

18:57.928 --> 19:01.181
Oh, I'm sorry, Hank.
I just got carried away.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.938
I'm gonna vomit.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.523
Be strong, Hank.

19:09.606 --> 19:13.026
Remember, this is the only way
to save our house.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.780
But if you need to, we could use
an extra carpet stain in Bobby's room.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.827
Doorbell doesn't work.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.246
It's not dangerous. But it is a violation.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.634
With all the home-improvement shows
these days,

19:37.718 --> 19:41.263
you'd think maintenance
wouldn't be such an alien concept.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.784
Oh, this is really horrible.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.662
I feel like your boxing manager.
And you've been beat up.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.874
And I have to cut your eye with a razor
so you can see.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.634
If I were a joking man, I'd say,
"Here's the damage." But I'm not.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.636
I'm gonna have to fail this house.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.056
It'd take a skilled craftsman
a thousand man hours to fix it.

20:24.139 --> 20:27.059
A thousand man hours?
That's, that's a lot of money!

20:27.142 --> 20:28.936
Sorry, folks. I'm out.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.567
Care to read my report, Mister Hill?

20:35.651 --> 20:39.655
No. I'll wait and read it
with everyone else in town.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.657
I'm thinking the master craftsman

20:41.740 --> 20:45.911
who destroyed this house should
have no problem repairing it.

20:46.745 --> 20:50.582
Uh, you're talking over my head here, sir.

20:50.666 --> 20:55.254
I'm... I'm just a bad homeowner.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.465
Mister Hill, only someone
with incredible skills

20:58.548 --> 21:02.177
could make such a well maintained home
appear so damaged.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.595
I'm impressed.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.312
<i>This is a house of healing.</i>

21:12.396 --> 21:16.775
<i>Uncle Jeb, you don't need that
oxygen tank to breathe in here.</i>

21:19.027 --> 21:21.280
<i>Yes, he does. Bobby,
put his mask back on.</i>

21:54.813 --> 21:57.399
-<i>Well, obviously, babies are
not as stupid as they look.</i>
