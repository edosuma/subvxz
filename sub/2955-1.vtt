Israeli and Ramirez moving forward

01:00.656 --> 01:04.527
with the insanity defense
that he chooses to establish.

01:04.927 --> 01:08.798
Four women and three men
were found shot to death in their home...

01:09.298 --> 01:11.090
Fire...

01:50.939 --> 01:53.909
There is no known motive for this crime.

01:54.009 --> 01:56.810
There is also very little
outward signs of the...

02:33.348 --> 02:36.516
She saw the body of a young man
laying right here...

02:39.454 --> 02:42.655
She saw the body of a young man
laying right here...

02:55.103 --> 02:59.305
Mental illness is the only... mental illness
is the only accurate explanation.

03:04.179 --> 03:07.313
She saw the body of a young man
laying right here...

03:09.384 --> 03:12.618
Now, this is a very tragic situation.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.809
Hey.

03:21.096 --> 03:22.498
Dude.

03:23.893 --> 03:26.899
Can you turn it down?
I can't hear myself think.

03:30.973 --> 03:33.505
You gonna get out
of this shit hole today, buddy?

03:37.145 --> 03:39.481
Come on, let's do
something interesting for once.

03:39.781 --> 03:42.017
I am doing something interesting.

03:42.117 --> 03:45.387
At lest 19,876 followers agrees.

03:45.487 --> 03:49.122
Followers. Come on.
See how normal people live.

03:56.965 --> 03:58.467
She's all right.

03:58.567 --> 04:01.401
Got a sexy little librarian thing going.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.007
I mean, come on,
she looks like such a nice girl,

04:05.107 --> 04:06.942
but you know, she gets
a couple of lemon drops in her,

04:07.042 --> 04:09.737
and then she wants it in the ass.

04:13.347 --> 04:15.284
Did you not see that?

04:15.684 --> 04:18.521
She just looked at you. Go say hello.

04:18.921 --> 04:22.922
That's your in, idiot. Go say hello.
What's wrong with you? Hey!

04:25.160 --> 04:27.229
That's the way you're gonna walk?

04:31.265 --> 04:32.390
How do you expect to ever get laid

04:32.490 --> 04:36.038
if the thought of talking to a chick
on the street makes you wet yourself?

04:38.182 --> 04:40.776
Oh, that's fine. I guess gettin' laid
just isn't everybody's bag, right?

04:40.876 --> 04:43.713
Good thing God
invented jerking off, right?

04:44.613 --> 04:47.082
Come on. I'm just bustin' your balls.

04:47.282 --> 04:49.916
I know homeless chicks
are more your speed anyway.

04:54.022 --> 04:56.455
Broadway Women's Shelter,
can I help you?

05:05.566 --> 05:06.602
Jim.

05:06.702 --> 05:10.405
Kevin, I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to just... should I just come back later?

05:10.505 --> 05:14.076
No, no. Just doin' exercises
for my sciatica.

05:14.176 --> 05:16.144
Give me a hand up, would ya?

05:16.945 --> 05:19.915
How ya been, young man?
It's been awhile.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.885
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

05:22.985 --> 05:24.753
You're fine?

05:24.853 --> 05:27.742
You're fine. What does fine mean?

05:29.291 --> 05:31.267
I'm good.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.630
Good. Good.

05:35.405 --> 05:38.065
Well, come on. Let me show you
what's goin' on out here.

05:40.935 --> 05:44.573
This is Wendy. You wanna show Jim
what's up with the computer?

05:44.673 --> 05:47.209
So, when you're done, come back
in the office. We'll settle up, okay?

05:47.309 --> 05:51.434
It's... don't worry.
Don't worry, it's no charge.

05:52.781 --> 05:55.851
- You sure?
- Yeah, no, don't worry. It's no charge.

05:56.251 --> 05:59.636
Jim's an old friend.
So don't abuse him too much.

06:05.127 --> 06:07.359
God, I hate this computer.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.966
Old friend?

06:11.266 --> 06:13.336
Oh, yeah, he likes to say that.

06:14.036 --> 06:15.768
You should sit here.

06:19.508 --> 06:21.617
I'll take this.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.099
Do you... how do you like...

06:27.199 --> 06:29.321
Right there. You see that,
the thing that's blinking?

06:29.421 --> 06:30.877
That's what keeps popping up.

06:31.177 --> 06:35.888
That's actually normal.
It's just got a mild case of bein' a PC.

06:37.291 --> 06:38.478
I like it, by the way.

06:39.861 --> 06:42.531
Working here.
I'm getting my master's in social work,

06:42.631 --> 06:45.332
so it's really awesome
getting to work with Kevin.

06:46.668 --> 06:48.122
Sorry.

06:50.205 --> 06:53.909
Hey. This is Jim. Hey, Pete.

06:54.009 --> 06:57.980
Yeah, Pete, I'm just with...
I'm just with another client right now.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.684
I'll just call you after.

07:02.184 --> 07:03.972
Sorry.

07:05.320 --> 07:09.524
- Hey, what was that?
- Just work. Just another client.

07:09.624 --> 07:15.164
Sorry, I meant your ring tone, the track.
Was that Aquatic Gabe?

07:15.764 --> 07:16.941
It's me.

07:18.633 --> 07:20.402
That's really cool.

07:21.002 --> 07:24.240
Sounds like something
you'd hear on UK1, doesn't it?

07:25.340 --> 07:27.676
- I meant that as a compliment.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:27.776 --> 07:30.679
And I like some of that...
some of the stuff they play on...

07:30.779 --> 07:32.581
Yeah, thanks.

07:32.681 --> 07:36.385
I have to go do something
in the kitchen right now. Are we good?

07:36.485 --> 07:38.186
- It's all good.
- Okay.

07:38.286 --> 07:41.923
- Okay, yeah, sorry...
- All right, I'll catch you later. Thank you.

07:42.023 --> 07:42.825
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:42.925 --> 07:44.593
Hey, Wendy, can we set up the tables?

07:44.693 --> 07:46.294
It's a...

07:46.394 --> 07:48.096
it's all good.

07:48.496 --> 07:50.999
It's all good.

07:51.099 --> 07:52.167
All good.

07:52.267 --> 07:55.937
...abnormalities present
in all sociopathic humans.

07:56.037 --> 07:57.806
The problem most critics have
with this approach

07:57.906 --> 08:03.345
is that it is derived from a medical model
that tends to rigidly classify all clients

08:03.445 --> 08:05.614
as sick, or not sick.

08:05.714 --> 08:08.550
- Well, some people are clearly sick.
- True.

08:08.650 --> 08:13.155
But that's not the point.
Who gets to define sick?

08:13.255 --> 08:16.692
Obviously, if he presents a potential danger
to himself, and/or others...

08:16.792 --> 08:19.828
Okay, but that's every human being
on the planet.

08:20.128 --> 08:21.706
Potential isn't destiny.

08:21.806 --> 08:25.172
And the moment you stigmatize
and isolate the quote, unquote, "sick,"

08:25.272 --> 08:28.703
you risk precipitating the exact danger
you were trying to avoid.

08:28.903 --> 08:30.405
Bullshit.

08:30.505 --> 08:34.076
- Hey, let's be respectful.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

08:34.176 --> 08:38.847
That is just academic dogma.
It has no real world relevance.

08:38.947 --> 08:40.749
You talk to anyone
in the clinical environment,

08:40.849 --> 08:44.486
and they'll give you a million war stories
about the nut jobs they've met.

08:44.586 --> 08:45.921
Some people are sick.

08:46.321 --> 08:51.560
And those people are more volatile
and dangerous than the rest of us, period.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.062
And with that brief exchange,
we shall...

08:54.162 --> 08:59.366
Whatever. He waxes his eyebrows.
How smart can he actually be?

09:03.771 --> 09:08.577
So, wait, she said she likes your music?

09:09.477 --> 09:12.647
You know what the odds are of meeting a girl
who's actually into that noise?

09:12.747 --> 09:15.417
Not... not very likely.
It's still sort of a niche market.

09:15.517 --> 09:19.454
That was a rhetorical question, my friend.
But my point exactly.

09:19.754 --> 09:22.591
We've gotta do something about this,
or you are never gonna get laid.

09:22.691 --> 09:24.126
I've been laid.

09:24.926 --> 09:26.892
You count that?

09:41.243 --> 09:44.313
Marlow! Marlow, come here, boy.

09:44.813 --> 09:47.415
Marlow! There you are, buddy.

09:47.515 --> 09:50.918
Sorry 'bout that. You probably
just scared him. He's pretty sweet.

09:53.922 --> 09:55.546
We'll walk that way.

10:08.703 --> 10:11.938
Can you imagine a chick
even walkin' into this place?

10:13.941 --> 10:16.609
I think your head
would explode with shock.

10:19.314 --> 10:22.384
Might figure out
what a social cripple you are.

10:22.484 --> 10:26.753
I mean, it's not like it's gonna happen
any time soon, but let's just say...

10:44.738 --> 10:47.440
You should ask that girl Wendy out.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.804
You listenin' to me?

10:54.649 --> 10:56.313
Wendy.

10:57.652 --> 11:01.123
She likes your music for fuck sake.

11:01.223 --> 11:03.097
She's not a freak.

11:04.058 --> 11:06.118
She's not even fat.

11:11.298 --> 11:13.266
I know how you do it.

11:15.669 --> 11:17.349
Brain Tree.

11:19.774 --> 11:22.375
Come on, Brain Tree, that's your in.

11:23.811 --> 11:26.348
That's it, you take her a CD.

11:26.448 --> 11:29.043
She said she wanted
to hear it, didn't she?

11:29.984 --> 11:31.907
So you just say...

11:32.387 --> 11:34.322
you're there droppin' off a CD for her,

11:34.422 --> 11:37.692
then you don't look like a freak stalker
walkin' in there for no reason.

11:37.992 --> 11:39.603
That's your in.

11:41.563 --> 11:44.194
Come on, man. What are you so afraid of?

11:45.600 --> 11:48.136
Hey, isn't this
what you're always talkin' about?

11:48.536 --> 11:51.571
Finding a nice, normal girl?

11:59.947 --> 12:03.385
Okay, put your fuckin' tampon in,
and let's go.

12:03.585 --> 12:07.620
Today's the day we snag you an actual,
real-life chick.

12:12.393 --> 12:15.029
For once in your life, try to be cool.

12:15.129 --> 12:18.371
Nothin' weird or desperate.

12:19.033 --> 12:20.934
You can do this.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.510
- Would you like some?
- Thank you.

12:28.610 --> 12:29.891
Okay.

12:31.713 --> 12:33.948
Hi. Thank you.

12:34.048 --> 12:36.785
How are ya? Nice to see you.

12:37.085 --> 12:38.899
Potatoes?

12:40.121 --> 12:41.656
There you go.

12:41.756 --> 12:43.458
Potatoes.

12:44.669 --> 12:48.395
I'll also have
whatever that brown stuff is.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.933
What are you doin' here?

12:57.271 --> 13:00.073
That's... Brain Tree is my stuff.

13:02.543 --> 13:05.814
That's really nice. I'll listen to it...

13:06.014 --> 13:07.427
later.

13:09.751 --> 13:11.519
So...

13:11.619 --> 13:13.841
sorry, I have to get back.

13:14.389 --> 13:18.960
Oh, God, yeah, sorry. Of course,
you have, you're... you're doing your...

13:19.060 --> 13:24.063
I did just wanna... I wanted to ask you
one other question really, really fast.

13:27.034 --> 13:29.547
I wanted to...

13:30.338 --> 13:32.309
Sorry.

13:33.608 --> 13:36.537
- Wanted...
- You wanna hang out with me some time.

13:37.912 --> 13:40.079
- Yes.
- When?

13:41.583 --> 13:44.552
I didn't have like a whole plan,
or whatever.

13:44.652 --> 13:46.101
Right.

13:46.821 --> 13:49.291
I'm not like a... not like a player.

13:50.091 --> 13:51.224
Do you know Launch?

13:52.794 --> 13:55.404
It's... well, my friend Mood
has a residency there,

13:55.504 --> 13:57.899
so if you... we could go
tomorrow night if you want.

13:57.999 --> 14:00.335
That's tomorrow night. How should we...

14:00.835 --> 14:03.171
- We could meet out front at 10.
- That sounds good.

14:03.271 --> 14:06.107
At Launch at 10, I'll see you...

14:06.207 --> 14:07.976
I'll see you at Launch
tomorrow at 10, Wendy.

14:08.076 --> 14:09.515
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:10.778 --> 14:14.182
The self-defense classes don't always do
what you think they're gonna do.

14:14.282 --> 14:16.618
It's just a self-defense class.
Can you teach it or not?

14:16.718 --> 14:19.124
These ladies don't necessarily need
any more encouragement

14:19.224 --> 14:21.689
to get themselves
into violent situations.

14:21.789 --> 14:25.193
Self-defense techniques got a funny way
of turning battery into murder.

14:25.293 --> 14:27.460
You know what I'm sayin'?

14:29.297 --> 14:31.294
You all right?

14:32.767 --> 14:35.703
- Yeah, yeah.
- Cool.

14:35.803 --> 14:38.673
Seriously, potatoes?
That's the best you could come up with?

14:38.773 --> 14:42.377
- She laughed.
- Yeah, she probably laughed at you.

14:42.477 --> 14:44.413
How many times do I have to tell ya,
chicks dig confidence.

14:44.513 --> 14:48.616
You can't keep goin' in there
all scared and awkward. Oh, Wendy...

14:49.551 --> 14:52.253
You let her ask you out.

14:52.353 --> 14:54.055
That's the worst part.

15:03.899 --> 15:08.003
You're a sad, pathetic,
little man, aren't you?

15:08.703 --> 15:10.710
Does that make you feel good?

15:10.810 --> 15:12.260
Come on, man.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.841
What's the point?

15:13.941 --> 15:15.377
Twistin' those little knobs.

15:15.477 --> 15:17.479
If you don't strap on a sack
nothing's gonna...

15:17.579 --> 15:21.049
I don't care how many little trolls online
think Brain Tree's a genius.

15:21.149 --> 15:24.152
You don't see it, right?
That's what it is with you.

15:24.252 --> 15:26.885
She's never gonna go for a social creep.

15:30.024 --> 15:31.485
Grow some fuckin' balls.

15:48.776 --> 15:50.912
All right, look.

15:51.012 --> 15:53.081
I'm sorry.

15:53.381 --> 15:55.825
I'm sorry to be such a dick.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.182
But trust me,

16:00.955 --> 16:05.291
that's the side you gotta show girls
if you want 'em to take you seriously.

16:19.107 --> 16:20.706
Wendy?

16:28.249 --> 16:29.865
Wendy?

17:42.390 --> 17:44.192
It's okay.

17:44.492 --> 17:46.691
Just a bad dream.

17:52.199 --> 17:54.525
You're gonna be fine.

17:55.336 --> 17:57.839
I'm here for you, man.

17:57.939 --> 17:59.729
I'm right here.

18:01.743 --> 18:04.037
Don't be scared.

18:04.946 --> 18:07.539
It's okay. You can talk to me.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.818
What are you so afraid of?

18:10.918 --> 18:13.152
Just leave me alone.

18:15.422 --> 18:18.034
If that's what you want.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.827
But I'm only here to help you.

18:29.637 --> 18:31.853
Check this out.

18:38.379 --> 18:40.946
I got 'em at the spy store.

18:42.515 --> 18:46.250
Just sits right in your little ear.

18:48.355 --> 18:50.627
How cool is that?

18:55.262 --> 18:57.431
- What's your biggest fear?
- What did you do?

18:57.531 --> 18:59.801
What's your biggest fear?

19:00.601 --> 19:05.606
Not knowing what to say
and looking like a complete idiot, right?

19:06.941 --> 19:08.939
Well, guess what?

19:10.244 --> 19:13.345
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.253
You don't have to worry.

19:23.190 --> 19:25.326
You can't see it.

19:25.426 --> 19:29.230
If you could see it, what good would that do?
Then everybody else could.

19:29.330 --> 19:33.198
That's why it's... way in there.

19:35.736 --> 19:37.870
Take it out!

19:46.213 --> 19:48.449
Please, take it out.

19:48.549 --> 19:50.616
Calm down.

19:54.554 --> 19:57.957
I am trying to help you.

20:00.493 --> 20:03.265
The only reason I'm here

20:04.065 --> 20:07.252
is to help you.

20:12.272 --> 20:13.958
Come on.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.979
Take your pills.

20:18.079 --> 20:19.816
It's all good.

20:21.615 --> 20:24.382
Take your pills, and go to sleep.

20:27.621 --> 20:30.989
I'll just sit here quietly
until you go to sleep.

20:35.696 --> 20:37.733
When you wake up...

20:38.766 --> 20:41.484
everything's gonna be better.

20:44.371 --> 20:48.341
This is good, Jim.
It's all gonna be okay.

20:57.018 --> 20:59.405
This is progress, Jim.

20:59.821 --> 21:03.722
Just trust me, okay?

21:04.324 --> 21:06.294
It feels weird.

21:06.394 --> 21:08.963
You're gonna be glad I'm with you.

21:09.363 --> 21:11.299
Just wait.

21:11.699 --> 21:14.588
You'll always know what to say.

21:15.069 --> 21:16.068
I'll show you.

21:22.343 --> 21:23.444
Can I help you?

21:23.544 --> 21:25.780
Yeah, you can blow me in the conference room,
but I'm sure that's not what you...

21:25.880 --> 21:27.381
I'm...

21:27.581 --> 21:29.700
Oh, you're the computer guy.

21:30.484 --> 21:32.218
Let me show you the server.

21:35.055 --> 21:36.891
Now be cool.

21:36.991 --> 21:41.996
I'm gonna show you how to be cool.
Just do what I say, and see the results.

21:42.496 --> 21:43.932
Trust me.

21:44.432 --> 21:47.002
Say, great shoes.

21:47.902 --> 21:49.103
Say it.

21:49.203 --> 21:51.239
Great shoes.

21:51.539 --> 21:54.046
Thanks, I just got 'em actually.

21:54.842 --> 21:57.245
Sorry, it's at the very end
of the building.

21:57.345 --> 22:00.679
You could fall and break your neck back here,
and no one would even notice.

22:02.984 --> 22:05.186
Don't laugh like an idiot.

22:05.286 --> 22:08.553
Say, this must be
where all the office hook-ups happen.

22:10.291 --> 22:11.259
Do it.

22:11.559 --> 22:15.560
Well, this must be
where all the office hook-ups happen.

22:16.730 --> 22:19.700
Seen its share of action, I've heard.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.535
I'll bet you have.

22:21.635 --> 22:23.245
I'll bet you have.

22:24.538 --> 22:27.373
You see that? That was flirting.

22:33.012 --> 22:35.249
- Hi.
- You startled me.

22:35.349 --> 22:36.655
Sorry.

22:38.586 --> 22:41.055
What are you doing?

22:41.155 --> 22:42.137
All right, say,

22:42.237 --> 22:45.927
sorry, you look so good tonight,
I lost my train of thought for a second.

22:46.927 --> 22:47.969
You ready?

22:50.397 --> 22:52.431
We're on the list, come on.

23:20.861 --> 23:22.545
This is my friend.

23:25.566 --> 23:30.037
Fuck yeah, Jim. Wendy's told me
a lot about you. Nice to meet you.

23:30.137 --> 23:32.273
I told him about Brain Tree.
I hope that's okay.

23:32.373 --> 23:34.075
Yeah, dude, I know your shit.

23:34.175 --> 23:36.947
Brain Tree,
your beats are sick, dude, wicked.

23:38.379 --> 23:40.915
Yeah, well maybe after the show,
we can all hang out.

23:41.015 --> 23:44.485
Maybe we can like swap tricks. Yeah?

23:45.085 --> 23:46.667
Okay.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.233
Look, I hope it's cool,
but I ripped a couple of your tracks

23:56.333 --> 23:58.733
and loaded them on to my playlist.

23:59.834 --> 24:02.971
I mean, if you want, you can jump back there,
maybe spin for a little bit.

24:03.971 --> 24:05.306
You have my music?

24:05.506 --> 24:08.009
Come on, get up there.
It's gonna be fun, I promise you.

24:08.609 --> 24:10.144
I don't really... I don't really DJ.

24:10.244 --> 24:12.847
Come on, dude. I primed them.
They're ready.

24:13.147 --> 24:16.951
- Trust me. This crowd's gonna love it.
- It's cool.

24:17.651 --> 24:18.666
Dude, get up there.

24:18.766 --> 24:22.220
You made the track. You might as well
drop it on 'em. Come on, bro.

24:27.995 --> 24:30.299
- How do you, drag this in?
- Bouncer?

24:31.699 --> 24:33.250
Okay, got it.

24:33.801 --> 24:35.483
Let it work.

24:46.180 --> 24:51.219
Yo, yo, yo. We gotta special agent
up in this motherfucker, tonight, all right?

24:51.619 --> 24:55.274
I want everybody
to make some noise for my man,

24:55.374 --> 24:57.134
Brain Tree.

24:57.458 --> 24:58.949
Drop it.

25:51.879 --> 25:56.317
I love the last track.
That was probably my favorite.

25:56.917 --> 26:00.154
And what was that sound?
You know the sound I'm talking about?

26:00.254 --> 26:03.224
The one that...
you're gonna laugh at me.

26:03.324 --> 26:05.180
The one that goes...

26:09.630 --> 26:14.199
I think... I think
you're talkin' about a rece.

26:15.568 --> 26:18.987
A rece. I'll have to remember that.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.108
Why do I love that so much?

26:21.208 --> 26:25.579
It's just noise, right? It's just
like a bunch of noise put together.

26:25.679 --> 26:27.652
Yeah, it's like... it's like
combining them.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.069
It's like finding the perfect blend
of sounds and when you find it,

26:31.169 --> 26:34.321
you just use 'em together,
and they sound like...

26:34.521 --> 26:37.592
like silence. I don't know,
it probably doesn't make any sense.

26:38.592 --> 26:41.159
It does, actually.

26:41.929 --> 26:45.065
Hey, I hope I didn't put you
on the spot earlier.

26:45.165 --> 26:49.737
I just feel like... you know,
your stuff is so good,

26:49.837 --> 26:52.306
and... and I know you have
a lot of followers online,

26:52.406 --> 26:56.674
but... I don't know, I feel like
you should be signed to a record label

26:56.774 --> 26:59.079
and like out there
playing shows and stuff.

26:59.179 --> 27:03.050
I know what you're saying
and stuff, but I don't...

27:03.150 --> 27:05.553
I just want people
to be able to listen to it.

27:06.253 --> 27:08.422
You know, I just want it
to be there if they need it,

27:08.522 --> 27:10.857
you know, like even if they
don't have any money.

27:12.025 --> 27:14.429
Like some people have all these...

27:15.062 --> 27:18.442
sounds in their head, and they just...

27:19.733 --> 27:21.561
I think the music helps.

27:22.603 --> 27:25.056
Is that why you do it?

27:25.773 --> 27:27.942
To get rid of the sounds in your head?

27:29.042 --> 27:31.679
Yeah. Yeah.

27:31.779 --> 27:34.078
It helps me be by myself.

27:35.715 --> 27:38.831
When I was a kid,
I hated being by myself, which is funny,

27:38.931 --> 27:43.616
because now I pretty much
only feel normal when I'm alone.

27:44.057 --> 27:46.460
That made me sound like such a loser.

27:46.560 --> 27:51.098
Wendy, you're like the farthest thing
from a loser I've ever seen.

27:51.198 --> 27:53.664
You just like to be alone.

27:55.135 --> 27:58.869
Enough with the nerd shit.
Just take her home.

28:00.807 --> 28:02.428
What?

28:03.243 --> 28:04.745
Nothing.

28:04.845 --> 28:08.057
Come on, just say it. Trust me.

28:09.483 --> 28:12.887
- Hey, would you mind walking me home?
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

28:13.787 --> 28:15.655
Sure.

28:26.365 --> 28:28.068
Thanks.

28:28.268 --> 28:29.536
I had fun.

28:29.636 --> 28:32.146
Yeah, me too.

28:47.154 --> 28:50.322
It's okay, sorry, I just...
I wasn't expecting that.

28:53.759 --> 28:55.594
I liked it.

29:42.141 --> 29:43.858
I just...

29:45.478 --> 29:47.804
- I just...
- That's okay.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.876
It's okay.

29:52.920 --> 29:57.122
This happens. Let me...
let me get you something, okay?

30:23.917 --> 30:25.794
Where are you going?

30:28.755 --> 30:32.924
I just think we should...
we should slow things down, okay?

30:40.200 --> 30:42.567
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.

30:43.337 --> 30:46.270
You jizzed in your pants?

30:47.540 --> 30:49.960
Are you kidding me? Are you 12?

30:50.377 --> 30:53.514
She barely even touched you,
and you jizzed everywhere?

30:53.614 --> 30:56.148
You know what she thinks of you now, right?
That you're a pathetic loser!

30:58.919 --> 31:02.256
I don't know how you can go on
being such a useless fuck nut.

31:02.456 --> 31:06.059
She's laughing at you.
She's mocking you to her friends,

31:06.159 --> 31:09.698
calling you a fucking limp dick loser,
premature ejaculator.

31:10.998 --> 31:13.667
She's laughin' at you, man.

31:13.767 --> 31:16.122
She's dyin' of laughter.

31:17.538 --> 31:19.039
What?

31:19.139 --> 31:21.431
You think chicks
don't talk about that shit?

31:22.309 --> 31:25.680
She's telling all of her friends
right about now.

31:26.380 --> 31:30.073
Probably five of 'em sittin' around
with their fucking lattes

31:30.173 --> 31:33.633
talkin' about you and your pin dick.

31:34.321 --> 31:37.158
You are a fuckin' embarrassment.

31:37.358 --> 31:39.888
Now everybody knows.

31:43.163 --> 31:45.732
He jizzed his pants.

31:45.832 --> 31:47.766
His pants.

31:48.535 --> 31:50.702
Dyin' of...

31:53.407 --> 31:55.040
Hello!

31:57.911 --> 31:59.577
Hello!

32:04.317 --> 32:05.752
What do you want?

32:05.852 --> 32:08.689
Can you just maybe turn down
your music a little bit, dude?

32:08.789 --> 32:11.129
You're not the only person
that lives here, you know.

32:11.258 --> 32:12.777
Fuck off.

32:13.394 --> 32:14.996
- Finally.
- Fuck you.

32:15.096 --> 32:17.368
You act like a fuckin' man.

32:19.066 --> 32:22.967
Tell me that didn't feel good,
standin' up for yourself.

32:54.368 --> 32:56.835
You gonna let this bitch
keep bossin' you around?

32:57.504 --> 32:58.970
Shut her mouth.

33:00.341 --> 33:04.411
Maybe then you'll be ready to fix
this fucked up situation you're in.

33:04.611 --> 33:08.356
You can't let these bitches
just go around town talkin' shit about you,

33:08.456 --> 33:12.321
callin' you a two-pump chump
premature ejaculator.

33:15.888 --> 33:18.813
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.326
We've gotten some noise complaints.

33:25.565 --> 33:27.232
Mind if we come in?

33:34.173 --> 33:36.006
- Anyone else in here?
- No.

33:39.378 --> 33:41.560
You been drinking tonight, sir?

33:42.549 --> 33:44.451
A little.

33:44.651 --> 33:46.561
Any drugs?

33:55.629 --> 33:58.892
- Oh, well I have a prescription.
- So you do.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.670
You got anything else?
Any weapons around here?

34:03.970 --> 34:06.917
No. I don't.

34:07.741 --> 34:10.078
Wait, I... I have a gun.

34:11.178 --> 34:14.781
It's just a... just a toy.
It's an air pistol.

34:14.981 --> 34:17.114
Mind if we have a look at it?

34:19.052 --> 34:22.020
You want... Oh, okay. Okay.

34:23.989 --> 34:26.858
- Okay, that's good. I got it. Thank you.
- Okay.

34:28.661 --> 34:31.331
I'll just... I'll just...
I'm just gonna sit down.

34:31.431 --> 34:33.263
- Please.
- Okay.

34:40.507 --> 34:42.786
What you got there, a 22?

34:43.710 --> 34:47.047
I don't... I don't really know about...
about guns at all.

34:47.848 --> 34:49.916
Twenty-two can do some real damage
if you're not careful.

34:50.016 --> 34:52.052
- Okay.
- What do you use it for?

34:52.152 --> 34:54.020
I... I don't.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.755
I don't even use it. I just...

34:57.991 --> 35:00.975
Well, I shot at targets
a couple times, but...

35:01.075 --> 35:05.063
it was, well, it was boring.
It's just like computer games.

35:09.068 --> 35:13.574
All right. Well, do yourself a favor,
and just keep the music down.

35:13.674 --> 35:15.442
If we have to come back,
we're gonna cite you

35:15.542 --> 35:17.044
for disturbing the peace,
you understand that?

35:17.144 --> 35:20.280
It's not... not really fair.
She would disturb me.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.657
- Sir.
- Okay.

35:24.017 --> 35:26.010
Keep the music down.

35:53.413 --> 35:55.282
Stop it.

36:20.139 --> 36:22.079
I just...

36:23.209 --> 36:26.413
Do you remember... Vermood, was talking,

36:26.513 --> 36:32.152
your friend was talking about having me
do the remix for him, so I did it.

36:32.252 --> 36:35.088
And... I think it's...
I think it's cool.

36:35.188 --> 36:39.426
If you have four minutes,
I came here to play it for you.

36:39.526 --> 36:41.827
Jim, I'm at work right now.

36:42.963 --> 36:44.111
Right.

36:44.765 --> 36:48.134
Well, I was just swingin' by. I'll...

36:48.234 --> 36:52.690
I'll just... there's one other thing,
if you don't mind,

36:52.790 --> 36:56.009
just real quick. I just...

36:56.509 --> 36:58.545
had a lot of fun the other...
the other night,

36:58.645 --> 37:01.813
and I wanted to know if you wanted
to hang out again sometime.

37:03.749 --> 37:06.885
I just don't want you
to think I'm a total loser.

37:18.565 --> 37:21.368
Do you think we could talk about this
in Kevin's office?

37:21.468 --> 37:23.877
It has nothing to do with that.

37:23.977 --> 37:27.574
It's... But I think
that you're a really great guy,

37:27.674 --> 37:30.777
and I think that you're super talented.
And if you're open to it...

37:30.877 --> 37:33.614
- She's lying.
- We could try being friends.

37:33.714 --> 37:35.146
Stop it!

37:37.884 --> 37:39.386
Jim, what's going on?

37:39.586 --> 37:42.322
- She's a fucking cunt.
- You're a fucking...

37:42.422 --> 37:44.490
You're a fucking cunt.

37:46.092 --> 37:49.218
- Fucking cunt.
- Fucking cunt.

38:12.853 --> 38:14.886
So, I'll see you at home?

38:44.217 --> 38:47.092
Cases like Jim's are the reason...

38:47.754 --> 38:49.314
that I stopped doing clinical work.

38:50.590 --> 38:52.859
He's schizophrenic.

38:53.059 --> 38:55.646
It's more than psychopathology.

38:56.229 --> 39:00.367
This isn't politically correct to say,
but there's a limit to...

39:00.667 --> 39:01.968
I am a man.

39:02.068 --> 39:05.169
- How much we can help people.
- I am a man.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.075
Shut up!

39:09.175 --> 39:13.423
There's some extreme cases
where no amount of talk therapy...

39:13.523 --> 39:15.204
will help a person recover.

39:16.116 --> 39:18.518
I mean, medication can help them
become more functional.

39:18.618 --> 39:19.528
Can I get the vodka?

39:19.628 --> 39:24.324
The real healing
is just not always possible.

39:24.424 --> 39:27.494
So, you're saying some people
are beyond help.

39:27.594 --> 39:31.666
Jim has been through horrors
that you can't begin to imagine.

39:32.766 --> 39:34.701
He obviously needs help.

39:34.801 --> 39:36.803
Needing it and wanting it
are two different things.

39:36.903 --> 39:40.987
No, men don't let lying cunts fucking tell
everyone how pathetic they are at sex,

39:41.087 --> 39:43.489
and they can't do anything right.
They can't even been touched

39:43.589 --> 39:47.446
without fucking cumming in their pants!
You piece of shit!

39:48.314 --> 39:49.649
You listen to me.

39:49.749 --> 39:51.284
- You know what you have to do.
- I don't know it.

39:51.384 --> 39:54.142
I am not gonna let you alone
until you do what you have to do.

39:54.242 --> 39:56.923
With all due respect,
I think that's complete bullshit.

39:57.123 --> 39:59.627
I'm sorry, I just... I...

40:00.727 --> 40:05.364
I just don't understand how you can decide
which cases are just too difficult.

40:39.165 --> 40:41.077
We'll see.

40:42.102 --> 40:44.403
We'll see what happens.

40:44.503 --> 40:46.239
- Hey, Jim.
- Okay, friend, we'll see what happens.

40:46.339 --> 40:47.922
- It's Kevin.
- We'll see.

40:49.742 --> 40:52.064
Whoa, Jim.

40:57.850 --> 40:59.927
- Jim, I...
- Shut up!

41:08.862 --> 41:11.361
The truth hurts too much.

41:13.133 --> 41:16.837
Go ahead, pussy.
Go ahead and let me see you do it.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.909
Let me see it.

41:23.009 --> 41:25.877
I wanna see if you have the balls.

41:28.014 --> 41:30.080
I don't believe.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.746
Pussy.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.599
You dumb fuck.

42:11.291 --> 42:14.042
You're never getting rid of me, Jim.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.218
Not as long as you need me.

42:17.463 --> 42:18.487
You got that?

42:20.533 --> 42:26.272
As long as you insist on being a fuckin'
vagina who lets people walk all over him,

42:26.572 --> 42:30.288
you'll need me to protect you,

42:30.910 --> 42:32.623
to show you what to do.

42:34.247 --> 42:36.136
You're a child, Jim.

42:37.283 --> 42:39.219
Scared.

42:39.319 --> 42:41.788
Helpless. Useless.

42:41.888 --> 42:43.890
Lonely little child.

42:45.725 --> 42:48.269
What would you do without me?

42:49.629 --> 42:51.664
Got no friends.

42:51.764 --> 42:55.825
No one loves you. No one gives a shit
about you except for me.

42:57.704 --> 43:01.457
No girl wants you
and your tiny little pin dick.

43:02.242 --> 43:06.844
You will never satisfy a woman.

43:57.096 --> 44:00.731
We haven't been able to lift
any good prints, unfortunately.

44:01.501 --> 44:04.905
- 20/20 mean anything to you?
- No clue.

44:05.005 --> 44:07.373
Well, you have any idea
who mighta done this?

44:07.473 --> 44:10.962
Sure, I got about eight or 900 suspects
in my old case files.

44:13.546 --> 44:16.148
We'll see what the lab says.
It could just be kids messin' around.

44:16.248 --> 44:19.553
I mean you never know.
But... I'll keep you posted, all right?

44:22.187 --> 44:23.957
You know,

44:24.057 --> 44:26.926
sometimes when we think
we're protecting somebody,

44:27.026 --> 44:29.796
but really, we're just makin' it worse.

44:30.496 --> 44:33.138
I'm just sayin' that as your friend.

45:01.127 --> 45:05.129
I don't wanna call the police on him,
I just want him to get the help he needs.

45:08.301 --> 45:12.238
You can't help what's inside of him.
No one can.

45:12.638 --> 45:14.963
You should know that.

45:18.611 --> 45:22.249
You know what really happened that day

45:23.783 --> 45:27.125
with his brother and the other boy?

45:27.820 --> 45:32.298
It wasn't his fault.
That's all that matters.

45:34.026 --> 45:37.130
Mrs. Whitman, Jim's illness
is only gonna get worse.

45:37.230 --> 45:40.466
- Thank you for your visit.
- You don't understand.

45:40.566 --> 45:43.269
I can't help him, unless I know
what really happened to him.

45:43.369 --> 45:48.208
You can't prove anything.
And you can't change anything.

45:48.308 --> 45:52.443
So, what is the point of digging
all that back up now?

45:53.579 --> 45:55.305
I don't want him to get hurt.

45:57.217 --> 45:59.684
Leave my son alone.

46:44.696 --> 46:46.563
Jim?

46:48.667 --> 46:51.037
Jim, this isn't cool.

46:51.837 --> 46:54.339
You can't just show up to my building.

46:54.941 --> 46:57.210
Did you listen to my remix?

47:00.812 --> 47:02.115
Oh, my God, what happened?

47:02.215 --> 47:05.817
I just... I think if you hear it,
I know you'll like it.

47:09.988 --> 47:12.323
Wendy, I don't feel so good.

47:15.894 --> 47:18.329
I don't feel so good.

47:28.006 --> 47:30.534
Why don't you just sit down?

47:31.211 --> 47:33.209
Have a seat.

47:37.148 --> 47:39.454
What happened to your ear?

47:39.919 --> 47:41.390
I had to make him stop.

47:43.389 --> 47:45.388
Make who stop?

47:46.892 --> 47:49.695
He says mean things to me all the time,

47:49.795 --> 47:53.713
and I... I can't make him stop.

47:54.866 --> 47:57.129
I don't know what to do.

48:00.672 --> 48:02.842
It's gonna be okay.

48:02.942 --> 48:06.276
He makes me so angry.

48:07.312 --> 48:09.133
He makes me so angry.

48:11.417 --> 48:14.619
You know, you don't have to respond
to him when he talks to you.

48:20.892 --> 48:23.721
And you don't need to be afraid of him.

48:29.168 --> 48:31.201
Shut up!

48:33.306 --> 48:36.576
Sorry, Wendy,
I didn't mean to make you afraid.

48:36.676 --> 48:41.907
I didn't mean to scare you. He just won't...
he just doesn't know you.

48:43.516 --> 48:45.227
No, you don't.

48:46.718 --> 48:50.123
Jim, I'm gonna be right back. I'm just gonna
go and get something to clean you up.

48:50.223 --> 48:52.990
Just some antiseptic and a towel, okay?

49:20.786 --> 49:23.099
What are you doing in there?

49:25.091 --> 49:26.937
Wendy?

49:28.194 --> 49:31.564
Jim, can you go back
in the other room, please?

49:32.364 --> 49:36.759
I have to go to the bathroom, and I'm not
gonna do it if you're standing right there.

49:37.270 --> 49:38.769
You're making me nervous.

49:44.277 --> 49:46.711
Go back in the dining room.

49:52.418 --> 49:55.686
I don't know... I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

49:57.422 --> 49:59.657
I didn't do anything.

50:01.427 --> 50:03.096
I didn't do anything.

50:03.896 --> 50:07.500
I didn't do anything. I don't know
what you're saying right now.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.683
Not now.

50:10.536 --> 50:14.474
No, I don't know
what you're fucking talking about!

50:14.574 --> 50:18.310
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

50:18.410 --> 50:20.111
Shut up! Shut up!

50:25.818 --> 50:29.092
No, no.

50:29.889 --> 50:31.303
No.

50:34.760 --> 50:37.097
Why did you do that?

50:37.397 --> 50:39.530
Why did you do that?

51:08.761 --> 51:10.430
Wendy.

51:10.830 --> 51:12.632
They locked him up,
and they won't let me see him.

51:12.732 --> 51:16.869
It's gonna be all right. This is probably
the best place for him right now.

51:16.969 --> 51:18.719
What happened?

51:20.640 --> 51:24.485
He came over. He was bleeding.

51:26.111 --> 51:29.478
I don't know. I tried to help.
I didn't know...

51:29.578 --> 51:33.419
- What to do, you know? He scared me.
- Yeah.

51:33.519 --> 51:37.657
I know what he's going through.
He's not... he's not a bad person.

51:37.757 --> 51:41.362
He's just... he's sick, right?

51:42.662 --> 51:44.564
Tell me we're gonna help.

51:44.664 --> 51:46.978
Let me see what I can do, okay?

51:48.868 --> 51:53.105
The police aren't gonna file any charges,
so he's just here for observation.

51:53.205 --> 51:55.775
- So, can I talk to him?
- I'm afraid not.

51:55.875 --> 51:58.944
He prefers not to see you.
He says you're not his doctor.

51:59.044 --> 52:02.448
I'm a social worker. I have a PhD.

52:02.548 --> 52:05.585
I had a private practice for 22 years.
Jim was a client.

52:05.785 --> 52:08.525
- And when was that?
- When he was 13.

52:09.922 --> 52:12.458
He suffered a psychological trauma.

52:12.558 --> 52:14.760
What kind of trauma?

52:15.160 --> 52:18.917
He was brutally tortured,
he and another boy.

52:20.466 --> 52:23.636
Sexually abused, drugged,
psychologically tormented.

52:24.136 --> 52:27.237
Perpetrator killed the other boy

52:27.337 --> 52:29.125
while Jim watched.

52:30.342 --> 52:32.900
Perpetrator was his half-brother.

52:33.445 --> 52:38.084
Jake fled the scene. Was never apprehended.
He just disappeared.

52:38.984 --> 52:42.222
I think even now Jim lives in terror
that he might come back.

52:43.322 --> 52:46.058
And does Jim discuss this fair with you?

52:46.158 --> 52:50.129
He... he's unable to talk about it.

52:50.229 --> 52:51.968
Which part?

52:53.532 --> 52:55.256
Any of it.

52:56.902 --> 52:59.467
Why do you think that is?

53:01.539 --> 53:05.973
Jim needs good psychiatric treatment,
not opinions.

53:06.979 --> 53:09.081
Thank you for your help.

53:09.181 --> 53:11.463
We'll take it from here.

53:33.472 --> 53:35.007
Damn.

53:35.107 --> 53:37.409
I missed all the good stuff.

53:37.509 --> 53:39.092
Good.

53:40.379 --> 53:42.649
Girl, we're going out?

53:43.349 --> 53:48.053
I don't think I can go out tonight.
I'm not feeling very social.

53:48.153 --> 53:50.690
Don't tell me that that freak
is actually getting to you.

53:50.790 --> 53:54.193
I'm fine. I just wanna be alone.

53:54.293 --> 53:56.596
Last night you didn't wanna be alone.

53:56.696 --> 53:59.064
Just wish I had that affect on men.

53:59.164 --> 54:02.316
Come on. Let's go out.

54:04.936 --> 54:07.270
I'm not going out tonight.

54:09.040 --> 54:13.977
Yeah. Whatever.
You know what, you are such a flake.

55:26.151 --> 55:27.387
Hey, it's me.

55:28.087 --> 55:29.755
Yeah, I...

55:30.355 --> 55:32.473
I need a favor.

55:39.664 --> 55:40.902
Hey, Jim.

55:41.002 --> 55:43.436
- Say hi.
- Hi.

55:43.536 --> 55:45.304
Can I talk to you for a few minutes?

55:45.404 --> 55:48.405
- Sure.
- Sure.

55:52.144 --> 55:54.146
You know why you're here?

55:54.246 --> 55:56.949
I guess I had a little melt down
last night, but I feel better.

55:57.049 --> 56:00.733
I guess I had a little melt down
last night, but I feel better.

56:01.386 --> 56:02.956
Good.

56:04.857 --> 56:06.626
Has this kind of thing happened before?

56:06.726 --> 56:10.329
- It wasn't violent or anything.
- Never anything violent.

56:10.629 --> 56:12.812
Did you hear voices?

56:13.532 --> 56:16.436
- Just one.
- Just one.

56:16.936 --> 56:19.171
Did you see a psychiatrist?

56:19.271 --> 56:22.297
- He put me on Thorazine.
- He put me on Thorazine.

56:23.509 --> 56:26.011
- And did it help?
- It did.

56:26.111 --> 56:27.813
But it also made me really depressed,

56:27.913 --> 56:31.417
and then he put me on Prozac,
and I couldn't masturbate.

56:32.918 --> 56:34.019
Also...

56:34.119 --> 56:37.490
- I couldn't masturbate.
- You couldn't get an erection.

56:37.690 --> 56:41.627
It's very common.
So you stopped taking your medication?

56:41.727 --> 56:42.895
- I did.
- I did.

56:43.395 --> 56:44.774
Seeing a psychiatrist now?

56:45.731 --> 56:47.700
Right now, I'm seeing you, doctor.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.810
That's funny, Jim.

56:51.670 --> 56:55.207
Here's what I'd like to do.
I'd like you to try a new medication.

56:55.307 --> 56:58.544
It has a lower incidence
of sexual side-effects.

56:58.644 --> 57:03.149
And just this year, they've introduced it
in a long, acting injectable form.

57:03.549 --> 57:05.250
How's that sound?

57:05.350 --> 57:08.320
Sounds great.
Shall we start the injections today?

57:08.420 --> 57:10.656
Well, we have to start you
on the pill form, first.

57:11.356 --> 57:14.159
And if we find that it's working for you
and there are no serious side-effects,

57:14.259 --> 57:17.597
than we can move you
to the more long-term treatment.

57:18.397 --> 57:20.141
Okay.

57:20.766 --> 57:22.120
Good.

57:22.401 --> 57:24.570
You can start on that right away.

57:24.670 --> 57:29.242
Dr. Dubrow? Are you planning
on keeping me the whole 72 hours?

57:29.942 --> 57:32.078
You know the drill pretty well?

57:32.578 --> 57:34.722
I guess I do.

57:35.614 --> 57:38.383
I never thought he was violent.

57:38.483 --> 57:41.854
The world is a nasty,
fucked up place, my friend.

57:41.954 --> 57:44.724
Nothing you can do to change that.

57:45.124 --> 57:47.493
Go easy on yourself.

57:47.593 --> 57:49.965
Well, I gotta do something.

57:50.963 --> 57:54.834
He's clearly volatile.
And a 72-hour hold isn't gonna help.

57:54.934 --> 57:59.242
He should be in long-term treatment
for his own good.

57:59.404 --> 58:01.440
Can't just keep him locked up.

58:01.540 --> 58:04.767
Gotta have a good reason.
Gotta have evidence,

58:05.467 --> 58:08.130
or a judge ain't gonna buy it.

58:09.481 --> 58:10.514
Thanks.

58:57.429 --> 59:00.366
Excuse me?
Can I help you with something?

59:02.801 --> 59:04.970
I know the people who used to live here.

59:05.070 --> 59:07.772
Yeah, but what can I do for you?

59:08.640 --> 59:11.470
I just... it's important.

59:13.545 --> 59:18.377
I'm not exactly sure
I can explain to you what... is...

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.621
Brilliant.

01:00:11.103 --> 01:00:13.172
You're a man.

01:00:13.272 --> 01:00:15.641
They think they can lock you down.

01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:18.074
They're the crazy ones.

01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:06.925
I know it was you, wasn't it? What did you do
with my dog, you son of a bitch?

01:01:07.025 --> 01:01:10.026
You're not gonna get away with this,
you fucking freak!

01:02:14.459 --> 01:02:18.227
Gary. You scared the shit out of me.

01:02:46.924 --> 01:02:48.436
Hey.

01:02:49.528 --> 01:02:51.480
What's up?

01:02:53.332 --> 01:02:55.134
I'm fine.

01:02:55.234 --> 01:02:56.816
I'm home.

01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:03.458
I don't... think I'm really up for that.

01:03:04.609 --> 01:03:06.442
No thanks.

01:03:09.281 --> 01:03:11.817
I'm not isolating.

01:03:12.117 --> 01:03:14.012
I'm not. I actually have plans.

01:03:15.187 --> 01:03:17.755
My sister's having people over.

01:03:28.066 --> 01:03:29.701
Okay.

01:03:30.201 --> 01:03:32.839
Look, I'll call you after.
I don't know, maybe I'll stop by.

01:03:34.339 --> 01:03:37.273
Okay. Talk to you later, bye.

01:06:08.826 --> 01:06:11.430
What is wrong with you?
You scared the shit out of everyone.

01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:14.165
- Sorry, I just got scared.
- Of what?

01:06:14.265 --> 01:06:15.400
Mommy, who's that?

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.969
Aunt Wendy got startled by a dog outside.
Go finish your movie.

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:25.310
What is going on?
Is that guy still bothering you?

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:29.848
No. No, I just... just... I'm stupid.
I got freaked out.

01:06:30.248 --> 01:06:32.657
Wendy has a stalker.

01:06:33.318 --> 01:06:34.719
I don't have a stalker.

01:06:34.819 --> 01:06:37.971
He showed up at her house
with blood coming out of his ear,

01:06:38.071 --> 01:06:39.991
because he had jammed something into it.

01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:41.626
- That's disturbing.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.826 --> 01:06:43.689
I want a stalker.

01:06:44.563 --> 01:06:47.545
Well, I'm just saying.
It's kind of a compliment.

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:50.854
One way to look at it.

01:06:53.036 --> 01:06:55.407
Guys, come on.

01:06:55.507 --> 01:06:59.611
It's not... it's not that funny, you know.
He has a serious condition.

01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:01.577
You're not kidding.

01:07:02.013 --> 01:07:04.082
- What?
- Yeah, what?

01:07:04.182 --> 01:07:07.652
- Well, I mean this is really hilarious...
- Deb.

01:07:07.752 --> 01:07:10.622
No. Don't do that. You wouldn't want
someone doing that to you.

01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:13.826
Oh, who cares?
They don't know him. It's fine.

01:07:14.426 --> 01:07:18.480
- We won't tell anyone.
- Yeah, we don't. Tell us.

01:07:22.866 --> 01:07:26.104
Relax. Just John and Alex
are comin' over for a drink.

01:07:26.204 --> 01:07:29.874
Come on, before those guys walk in here,
and you really get uncomfortable.

01:07:29.974 --> 01:07:33.112
- Say it.
- Yeah. Come on, say it.

01:07:34.112 --> 01:07:36.748
- Say it.
- No.

01:07:36.848 --> 01:07:38.515
Oh, for God sakes.

01:07:42.921 --> 01:07:45.830
And the moment she touched it,
he blew his wad.

01:07:50.662 --> 01:07:52.446
Please don't.

01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:05.884
Come on, that's not that funny.
A lot of guys have that happen.

01:08:06.845 --> 01:08:07.444
What?

01:08:12.384 --> 01:08:14.486
- Okay, everyone shut up now.
- Jim?

01:08:14.586 --> 01:08:16.621
- Shut up.
- Jim, we were just...

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.424
Shut up! Shut up!

01:08:19.624 --> 01:08:22.194
Just everyone please, shut up.

01:08:22.694 --> 01:08:26.929
Stop looking at me.
I said, stop looking at me!

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.670
We're gonna tie each other up now.

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.569
Mommy!

01:08:38.676 --> 01:08:42.581
It's okay, honey.
We're just playing a game down here.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.917
Stay upstairs and watch TV, okay?

01:08:46.017 --> 01:08:47.889
Okay.

01:08:49.487 --> 01:08:52.756
Please. Please, don't hurt my kids.

01:08:52.857 --> 01:08:54.582
Please.

01:09:02.866 --> 01:09:05.167
Shut up!

01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:49.656
Okay.

01:09:53.384 --> 01:09:55.220
No!

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.421
Motherfucker, motherfucker, no!

01:10:03.928 --> 01:10:06.531
- Do it. Kill her, too.
- I'll fucking kill you!

01:10:06.631 --> 01:10:12.005
You leave my kids alone!
Motherfucker, you motherfucker, no!

01:10:13.805 --> 01:10:18.176
Leave them alone! I'll fucking kill you!
You leave my kids alone!

01:10:18.276 --> 01:10:22.281
Deb, Deb shut up. Deb, don't talk to him.
Shut up, look at me, listen to me.

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:25.584
You fucking leave my kids alone,
you freak.

01:10:25.684 --> 01:10:27.953
- I will fucking kill you!
- Deb, stop!

01:10:28.153 --> 01:10:32.390
I will fucking kill you,
you motherfucker.

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:33.458
Freak!

01:10:33.658 --> 01:10:37.362
What did you do?
What did you do, you fucking freak?

01:10:37.462 --> 01:10:39.664
- Deb, look at me!
- Fuckin' tiny dick!

01:10:39.864 --> 01:10:42.901
- Deb, stop!
- Fuckin' piece of shit.

01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:46.472
- You leave my fuckin' kids alone.
- Shut up!

01:10:47.472 --> 01:10:50.339
Shut the fuck up!

01:10:53.912 --> 01:10:55.013
Jim.

01:10:55.113 --> 01:10:59.584
Cunt. She told everybody, you heard her.

01:10:59.684 --> 01:11:01.920
Jim, you don't have to do this.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.222
You don't have to do this,
you don't have to listen to him.

01:11:04.322 --> 01:11:07.358
You don't have to listen to what
he's telling you to do. You're a good person.

01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:09.961
You're different than him.
You're stronger than that.

01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:12.630
It's me, I'm your friend,
please listen to me.

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:16.134
What needs to be done.
Just do what needs to be done.

01:11:16.234 --> 01:11:18.860
- Jim? Jim?
- It's almost over.

01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:24.008
Jim, Jim, what are you doing?
What are you doing right now?

01:11:24.108 --> 01:11:26.056
Everybody, everybody, everybody.

01:11:29.146 --> 01:11:31.970
Hurt her. Hurt her.

01:11:32.684 --> 01:11:33.782
Hurt her.

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:38.690
Don't do that, don't do that, don't, no,
no, no, no, no, look at me. Don't do that!

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:42.491
Stop! Jim, no, no, no!

01:11:45.364 --> 01:11:48.032
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:11:48.132 --> 01:11:49.651
Jim!

01:12:26.937 --> 01:12:30.008
Hey, do me a favor and turn around.

01:12:30.108 --> 01:12:33.578
Sir, I need you to drop
what's in your hand.

01:12:33.678 --> 01:12:36.789
Sir, drop the shovel and turn around.

01:12:40.718 --> 01:12:44.764
Put your hands on your head.
Show me your hands!

01:12:54.299 --> 01:12:55.960
Holy shit.

01:13:03.007 --> 01:13:06.144
Jimmy, get out of here. Get out of here!

01:13:06.244 --> 01:13:08.143
Go home!

01:13:18.789 --> 01:13:21.025
- Please, just call the hospital.
- Look, we'll look into it.

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.094
- When?
- When homicide gets here.

01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:27.326
No you... Goddamn it! You're not
listening to me. You need to do it now!

01:13:28.599 --> 01:13:32.696
Why aren't you listening to me?
You need to do it now!

01:13:34.205 --> 01:13:36.004
God.

01:14:09.707 --> 01:14:12.808
Press the bottom button.

01:14:31.429 --> 01:14:33.903
You know what you're gonna do?

01:14:34.932 --> 01:14:36.562
Do it.

01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:48.430
Jim.

01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:51.764
I know what you're going through.

01:14:53.217 --> 01:14:55.848
I know more than you realize.

01:14:56.587 --> 01:14:58.890
You know I know.
That's why you're here, isn't it?

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.944
- Please, stop talking now.
- That's why you followed me here, right?

01:15:03.127 --> 01:15:08.048
You didn't just wander up to 3310
Washington Boulevard for no reason.

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:13.202
It's because you know I understand.
You... what are you...

01:15:14.772 --> 01:15:18.776
Jim, no! No, no, no, no!
Help me! Help me!

01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:21.098
- No! No!
- Help me, please!

01:16:03.321 --> 01:16:04.322
What are you...

01:16:04.422 --> 01:16:06.390
Jim, no! No, no, no!

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:10.827
Help me, help me, please, help me!
Help me!

01:16:13.998 --> 01:16:16.434
They'll be here soon.

01:16:16.534 --> 01:16:18.646
There's only one thing left to do.

01:16:46.997 --> 01:16:48.439
What are you doing?

01:16:49.233 --> 01:16:51.066
Jim, what are you doing?

01:16:57.742 --> 01:16:59.077
What are you doing?

01:16:59.777 --> 01:17:04.148
Jim, no, there's children upstairs!
Jim, think about what you're doing!

01:17:04.248 --> 01:17:06.183
Don't listen to what
he's telling you to do.

01:17:06.283 --> 01:17:08.650
Don't listen to what
he's telling you to do.

01:17:11.455 --> 01:17:14.256
Don't listen to him, Jim.

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:24.199
He's telling you it's gonna make...
it better, but it won't.

01:17:27.672 --> 01:17:29.340
That's not true.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.555
Nothing will make it better.

01:17:38.282 --> 01:17:40.118
This won't make you better.

01:17:41.118 --> 01:17:42.792
Please.

01:17:44.088 --> 01:17:46.022
It wasn't your fault.

01:17:48.858 --> 01:17:50.515
Some people are just sick.

01:17:52.996 --> 01:17:54.851
People like us, we're sick.

01:17:56.066 --> 01:17:58.013
We're damaged.

01:17:58.603 --> 01:18:00.438
There's no reason for it.

01:18:00.938 --> 01:18:02.973
She's lying.

01:18:03.173 --> 01:18:06.105
Drop the... Do it.

01:18:10.348 --> 01:18:13.751
Please don't...
please don't hurt the kids.

01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:15.857
It's not their fault, Jim.

01:18:16.757 --> 01:18:19.989
It's not their fault.
And it wasn't your fault.

01:18:25.595 --> 01:18:30.665
You killed him. You crazy, fuckin'...
You crazy, fuckin' freak.

01:19:25.222 --> 01:19:26.769
Do it.

01:19:28.792 --> 01:19:31.762
Do it. Do it.

01:19:31.962 --> 01:19:33.653
Fuck him up.

01:19:34.064 --> 01:19:36.631
He's gonna tell everyone.

01:19:44.675 --> 01:19:45.666
No!

01:19:55.052 --> 01:19:57.326
I'm sorry, Wendy.

01:19:58.756 --> 01:20:01.459
Please, believe me, Wendy.

01:20:02.259 --> 01:20:04.405
I'm sorry.

01:20:05.996 --> 01:20:09.433
He made me do those things. I'm so...

01:20:09.733 --> 01:20:11.157
Fuck you!

01:21:11.928 --> 01:21:14.432
This did play out some 24 hours ago.

01:21:14.532 --> 01:21:17.501
There is no known motive for this crime.

01:21:17.601 --> 01:21:22.209
There is also very little outward sign
of the horrific tragedy

01:21:22.309 --> 01:21:25.604
that took place in the back unit
of this apartment

01:21:25.704 --> 01:21:29.413
in the 3000 block of Washington
Avenue in Los Angeles.

01:21:29.513 --> 01:21:31.306
Here is what we do know,

01:21:31.406 --> 01:21:34.094
a white male in his 20s
entered the unit carrying

01:21:34.194 --> 01:21:38.889
what police are describing
as a home modified 22-caliber air pistol.

01:21:38.989 --> 01:21:41.025
The assailant went on a shooting spree,

01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:44.760
killing two and leaving one woman
critically injured.

01:22:17.026 --> 01:22:18.696
Can I come in?

01:22:18.796 --> 01:22:20.269
Sure.

01:22:21.532 --> 01:22:22.539
You...

01:22:24.768 --> 01:22:28.336
have you started seeing anyone yet?

01:22:29.338 --> 01:22:31.475
Therapist, or...

01:22:31.575 --> 01:22:34.078
What's a fucking therapist gonna do?

01:22:34.178 --> 01:22:38.115
Her friends are dead because of her.
You think therapy's gonna help that?

01:22:38.215 --> 01:22:40.718
It's important that you do,

01:22:41.018 --> 01:22:43.087
when you're ready.

01:22:43.487 --> 01:22:46.390
I know you know that,
but I just thought...

01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:48.631
that well...

01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.961
when you're ready.

01:22:51.061 --> 01:22:54.530
Tell this fucking retard
to get the fuck out of our house.

01:22:56.467 --> 01:23:00.891
I just want you to know I'm...
I'm not gonna give up on you.

01:23:01.939 --> 01:23:03.750
Okay, I won't... I won't do it.

01:23:06.076 --> 01:23:10.378
So, you may as well...
just get used to me being around.

01:23:14.885 --> 01:23:16.893
You hear that?

01:23:17.387 --> 01:23:19.758
Aren't we lucky.

01:23:20.224 --> 01:23:23.193
We're gonna be fine all on our own.

01:23:23.293 --> 01:23:28.099
You don't need him.
You don't need anybody, you have me.

01:23:28.999 --> 01:23:32.302
We can take care of ourselves just fine,

01:23:32.402 --> 01:23:34.905
and if he doesn't back off,

01:23:35.205 --> 01:23:38.477
we'll take care of him, too.
We'll take care of him, too.

01:26:34.818 --> 01:26:38.388
All right. Still very early
in this investigation, obviously.

01:26:38.488 --> 01:26:41.692
Though, this did play out
some 24 hours ago.

01:26:41.792 --> 01:26:44.561
There is no known motive for this crime.

01:26:44.761 --> 01:26:49.181
There is also very little outward sign
of the horrific tragedy

01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:53.234
that took place in the back unit
of this apartment.

01:27:08.618 --> 01:27:10.220
Here is what we do know,

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.990
a white male in his 20s
entered the unit carrying

01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:17.561
what police are describing
as a home modified 22-caliber air pistol.

01:27:17.661 --> 01:27:20.026
The assailant went
on a shooting spree, killing two,

01:27:20.126 --> 01:27:22.830
and leaving one woman
critically injured.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.823
This is a very tragic situation.
