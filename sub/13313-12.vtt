My cancer's going away.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.548
What are you talking about?

16:05.548 --> 16:09.135
The doctor did the MRI...
and the blood work,

16:09.135 --> 16:13.181
and it looks like
it's disappearing, basically.

16:13.181 --> 16:15.350
That's great, sweetheart.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.894
It's a miracle.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.189
Yesterday...

16:20.189 --> 16:23.274
I thought everything
was over.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.944
I thought I'd be dead
within a year.

16:25.944 --> 16:29.114
I thought that we'd never
be able to come home again.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.284
[chuckles]
And now look.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.121
We got a fresh start, Ray.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.213
Go back to sleep.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.595
[sighs]

16:56.225 --> 16:59.228
[glass clinks on table]

17:02.063 --> 17:03.982
[man on radio] You've been
out of the public eye

17:03.982 --> 17:05.358
for three weeks, since
the death of your sister.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.026
How has it impacted
your training?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.778
[Hector] I'm ready.
I'm strong.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.488
[man] You were knocked out
in less than two minutes

17:10.488 --> 17:12.407
last time, champ.
What really happened?

17:12.407 --> 17:15.034
[Hector] I wasn't in shape.
I wasn't prepared.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.953
[man] Vegas has you
as a four-to-one underdog

17:16.953 --> 17:19.164
in tomorrow's fight.
How do you feel about that?

17:19.164 --> 17:21.250
[Hector]
I don't care about the odds.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.793
Whittaker's predicting
another first round knockout.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.588
Last time, Whittaker
saw me at my worst.

17:26.588 --> 17:31.009
He's gonna need luck himself
to come out of the first round.

17:31.009 --> 17:34.053
Your sister's suicide
must be weighing heavily on you.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.055
Of course.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.807
When are you going to comment
on her allegations

17:37.807 --> 17:39.642
of a sexual relationship?

17:39.642 --> 17:41.227
[chuckles]

17:41.227 --> 17:43.105
Jessica, my love,

17:43.105 --> 17:45.440
can you send Stella
up here?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.860
[indistinct chatter]

17:48.860 --> 17:52.238
[Hector] Oh.
Tell 'em, Stella.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.160
[Stella] Do you know da story?
[Hector] No, what's the story?

17:56.160 --> 17:58.203
[Stella] You're gonna da-story
Whittaker.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.247
My daddy's gonna
da-story Whittaker.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.292
Yah!
[chuckles]

18:03.292 --> 18:06.170
Come on, friends,
you can't argue with this face.

18:06.170 --> 18:09.464
And my little girl, Stella,
mm, she is always right.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.050
I'm gonna da-story Whittaker.

18:12.050 --> 18:16.346
- [indistinct chatter]
- [woman] Hector, Hector...

18:16.346 --> 18:17.764
[Benito] Thank you for coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.099
We will see you
tomorrow night.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.897
- Morning.
- Morning, Dad.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.899
Morning.
We're late.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.950
- What's going on?
- [chuckles]

18:36.950 --> 18:39.410
Look what Bridget
just gave me.

18:39.410 --> 18:43.332
She got in.
She's going to NYU.

18:43.332 --> 18:45.333
There's an orientation
this weekend.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.126
Thought we could fly her
to New York.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.088
- When?
- Today.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.465
We can put her up
in a nice hotel.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.468
- Sure.
- [phone ringing]

18:57.804 --> 19:00.098
- Yeah?
- [Frank] I need you to come in.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.017
- I'm busy.
- Now.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.021
You should take her
to the airport.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.482
I know it would mean
a lot to her.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.484
Yeah, sure.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.740
[chuckles]

19:31.379 --> 19:35.258
So,
what's your fucking problem?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.260
[exhales deeply]

19:40.222 --> 19:42.932
Yo, when the fight's over,

19:42.932 --> 19:45.602
you gonna want me gone?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.397
Want you gone?

19:48.397 --> 19:50.565
After Hector wins
tomorrow night,

19:50.565 --> 19:53.985
I'm gonna put all my focus
into you.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.405
You're gonna be
the next Hector Campos.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.160
Yo, for real?

20:03.328 --> 20:06.873
Here's the keys to the club.

20:06.873 --> 20:10.168
Next time there's a banner
on that wall,

20:10.168 --> 20:12.795
it better have
your fucking picture on it.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.262
Morning.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.804
You're gonna look sharp.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.224
Yeah?
How's your dress?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.351
Kinda tight.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.187
I'm older than I was
when I bought it.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.105
I like you
in a tight dress.

20:31.105 --> 20:35.109
Well, that's what
you're gonna get.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.153
So, we're all set.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.655
I got pizzas and cookies

20:38.655 --> 20:40.281
and ice cream
and lots of booze.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.534
I don't know, you know.
What if he loses?

20:43.534 --> 20:47.830
If he loses,
it's even more important.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.083
Yo, thank you, Terry.

20:50.083 --> 20:54.337
I ain't ever had my own key
to nowhere before.

20:54.337 --> 20:57.423
You're like--
Come here, you're like--

20:57.423 --> 20:59.175
Yeah, uh, come on, kid.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.095
Get your fucking hands
off me.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.267
What the hell
was that about?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.937
I told him he's got
a place here, is all.

21:10.937 --> 21:15.108
Gave him his own key.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.317
You're a good man.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.903
Yeah.

21:18.903 --> 21:23.282
Well...

21:23.282 --> 21:25.284
you do too.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.746
- What?
- You got a place here.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.332
If you want it.

21:31.332 --> 21:34.919
With me.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.338
You already got me to wear
a fancy fucking dress.

21:37.338 --> 21:40.174
Let's just...start with that,
okay?

21:48.350 --> 21:50.309
All right, look here.
Yeah, you.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.519
Here.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.396
Yep, just--
just watch the fingers.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.689
Watch the fingers.
Here, I got another.

21:54.689 --> 21:55.982
- Mickey.
- One fucking bite.

21:55.982 --> 21:56.983
You gotta start listening
to the rules.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.484
There it is.
Here.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.528
If you want to stay here,
you need to stop feeding him.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.196
He slobbers all over
the place.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.323
You got the idea?
She gonna throw us both out.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.742
- Here, one more.
- Come on.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.327
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, out.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.662
Out you go.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.873
All right, look, see.
He did.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.624
You're right.
He slobbers on everything.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.251
Reminds me of me.

22:15.251 --> 22:18.547
Very loving, but he makes a mess
everywhere he goes.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.306
What?

22:28.306 --> 22:30.392
Bridget got into
NY-fucking-U.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.560
Oh!

22:32.560 --> 22:34.353
She's got
her mother's smarts.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.399
Little Abby genes
running around in there.

22:37.399 --> 22:41.819
[chuckles]
[sniffs]

22:41.819 --> 22:43.654
Good for her.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.243
[chuckles]

22:50.870 --> 22:53.164
Abby, my darling,

22:53.164 --> 22:55.875
by any chance,

22:55.875 --> 22:58.544
would you be interested
in giving me a loan?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.213
What for?

23:00.213 --> 23:03.800
I got an inside line
on a sure thing.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.803
Yeah, sure you do.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.262
I'm pawning everything.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.597
I'm pawning
my Sansui speakers.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.433
I'm pawning my--
maybe my watch.

23:12.433 --> 23:16.854
My vintage porn
is worth something.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.440
Look, it's really good odds.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.400
Maybe 30 to one.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.986
And, uh, if anything happens,

23:23.986 --> 23:27.281
we just have to make sure
the family is covered, don't we?

23:27.281 --> 23:30.827
Have money in the bank for those
beautiful children of yours.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.789
How much you talking about?

23:34.789 --> 23:37.124
Hundred thousand will do it.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.545
[scoffs] We don't got
that kinda cash around here.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.506
Okay.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.633
I understand.

23:44.633 --> 23:48.553
[Mickey sips drink]

23:48.553 --> 23:52.014
But I do got something
I'd like to get the fuck rid of.

24:07.822 --> 24:10.491
Sell it,
place the bet.

24:10.491 --> 24:14.078
- Sure.
- I'll split the money with you.

24:21.669 --> 24:22.670
[door buzzing]

24:22.670 --> 24:24.005
[phones ringing]

24:24.005 --> 24:26.007
[woman] FBI,
Los Angeles office.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.010
[indistinct chatter]

24:44.901 --> 24:47.862
We're wiring you
for the fight.

24:47.862 --> 24:51.490
It's gonna be loud,
so you need to be close to him.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.578
- You hear from Sonia?
- Of course.

24:54.578 --> 24:56.871
'Cause I haven't.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.498
Well, she's with her people.
I'm sure she's fine.

24:59.498 --> 25:03.336
You think?

25:03.336 --> 25:05.671
The camera and the microphone
are sewn into the shirt.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.298
Tomorrow night,
you meet us at the arena.

25:07.298 --> 25:09.508
We connect you
to the surveillance van.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.135
From that point on,
you get him to talk.

25:11.135 --> 25:14.972
We arrest him.
It's as simple as that.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.642
I wear this wire,
you give me back my files.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.936
You do this
and I'll forget everything.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.563
Hell, I'll personally move
your family to Idaho.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.525
We good?

25:29.403 --> 25:30.655
Thank you, Ray.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.657
Fuck you, Frank.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.706
Burnin' for Black,
right on.

25:40.706 --> 25:44.669
Black Liquorice
and Sweet White Cream.

25:44.669 --> 25:47.756
- There you go.
- Yeah, they're all classics.

25:47.756 --> 25:50.424
But this  one, look.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.761
This is a--
this is a famous painting.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.596
By, uh, a famous painter.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.014
Yeah, so?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.557
It's one of his early works.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.809
You can check it
on the Internet.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.268
It's worth 60 grand.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.687
I'll give it to you for 50.

26:02.687 --> 26:03.771
Look around, hmm.

26:03.771 --> 26:04.981
You see any fucking art here?

26:04.981 --> 26:06.482
Well you never know

26:06.482 --> 26:07.776
who a man might know.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.568
Businesses like this

26:09.568 --> 26:12.989
usually overlap with businesses
that are less formal, right?

26:12.989 --> 26:14.824
Yeah, well, I might, uh,

26:14.824 --> 26:18.619
know somebody.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.247
I'll tell you what.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.249
I'll give you all
this vintage smut

26:23.249 --> 26:25.418
plus the Sansui speakers.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.420
You give me a connection.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.214
- You give me a name.
- [exhales deeply]

26:30.214 --> 26:33.760
Hey, listen, I-I hate--
I hate to give away this stuff.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.553
I mean, I--I'm gonna miss it.

26:35.553 --> 26:39.598
This one, ooh-ooh.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.768
2000 and Cum:

26:41.768 --> 26:45.647
a Face Odyssey.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.523
That's a really good picture.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.858
Actors got some,
you know,

26:48.858 --> 26:50.609
they got some, uh,
chops.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.611
It's like you're really there.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.620
[car horn sounds in distance]

27:22.850 --> 27:24.852
[exhales deeply]

27:30.692 --> 27:32.860
May I come in?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.862
Sure.

27:50.252 --> 27:53.757
I've missed you
in confession.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.717
Yeah?
Well, you know, I've been busy.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.302
Yeah, yeah.
I've heard

27:58.302 --> 28:00.471
you're not going to
meetings anymore.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.523
What can I do for you,
Father?

28:13.818 --> 28:17.238
Hector called me.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.697
He asked for confession.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.866
Yeah?

28:23.828 --> 28:26.455
He told me about his sister.

28:26.455 --> 28:30.876
- And your arrangement.
- So?

28:30.876 --> 28:33.712
He doesn't want to lie
anymore, Ray.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.381
What's that supposed
to mean?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.716
He wants to fight tomorrow
to win,

28:37.716 --> 28:40.762
and then face the consequences
of his actions.

28:40.762 --> 28:45.266
Oh.
[chuckles]

28:45.266 --> 28:46.725
You tell him
that was a good idea?

28:46.725 --> 28:49.186
- I encouraged him.
- What happened, Father?

28:49.186 --> 28:52.481
You get a little call
from the Cardinal?

28:52.481 --> 28:55.067
Pope wants to see a Catholic
wearing the belt?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.111
You sound paranoid, Ray.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.613
Paranoid?

28:59.613 --> 29:01.115
And all of a sudden,
you come crawling out

29:01.115 --> 29:03.325
from the fucking floorboards
asking me to forgive

29:03.325 --> 29:04.535
a debt you don't know
anything about.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.745
A debt paid for in lies.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.164
