38:19.559 --> 38:22.929
That... that is an incredible story.

38:22.980 --> 38:26.992
Oh, freaking out a bunch
of wannabe Thrifty Towners?

38:27.017 --> 38:28.183
Hardly.

38:28.358 --> 38:31.702
- Self-sabotage at best, nothing more.
- No

38:31.727 --> 38:32.843
Why do you do that?

38:33.057 --> 38:34.556
Self-sabotage?

38:34.581 --> 38:36.047
No, self-deprecate.

38:36.072 --> 38:37.905
It's... it's almost every other sentence.

38:38.008 --> 38:43.628
Uh... some sort of self-defense mechanism.

38:43.653 --> 38:45.737
It makes me sad. [ Scoffs ]

38:45.762 --> 38:47.595
What the hell do I know?

38:47.879 --> 38:49.662
What the hell <i>do</i> you know?

38:49.687 --> 38:51.237
[ Both laugh ]

38:51.262 --> 38:53.851
And who the hell says
something makes them sad?

38:53.892 --> 38:54.858
Really?

38:54.883 --> 38:56.349
How about real men?

38:58.687 --> 39:00.487
[ Chuckles ]

39:00.522 --> 39:04.908
Look, I know dirtbags in
hotel bars the world over

39:04.943 --> 39:06.742
say this all the time,

39:06.810 --> 39:08.810
but I'm gonna say it,
and I'm gonna mean it.

39:09.031 --> 39:11.414
I bet the other dirtbags
don't say they really mean

39:11.450 --> 39:13.533
whatever it is you're about to say, though.

39:13.585 --> 39:17.663
I have never met anyone like you, ever.

39:17.873 --> 39:19.539
Take that literally.

39:19.541 --> 39:23.009
I've... I've never met
anyone with your life, ever.

39:23.045 --> 39:24.878
It's... it's amazing.

39:25.149 --> 39:27.099
And... and you are amazing

39:27.359 --> 39:29.716
for having dealt with it the way you have.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.768
I mean, I can't even begin to imagine

39:31.803 --> 39:33.386
how hard it's been for you,

39:33.438 --> 39:36.749
but you... By God, you've pulled it off.

39:38.815 --> 39:41.532
You are impressive, Amantha Holden.

39:41.557 --> 39:42.476
[ Chuckles ]

39:42.501 --> 39:44.167
And you're one hell of a trainee.

39:44.538 --> 39:46.738
- And you're going places, kid.
I can tell. - [Snorts]

39:52.624 --> 39:53.992
[ Chuckles ]

39:54.652 --> 39:58.320
Well, Mr. Forrest, uh [Chuckles]

39:59.315 --> 40:02.116
It has been lovely drinking
free booze with you.

40:02.141 --> 40:03.968
It has been lovely.

40:05.067 --> 40:06.656
But, uh...

40:07.756 --> 40:09.422
Think I'm gonna head on up.

40:09.474 --> 40:10.924
Yeah, yeah. Right.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.760
Me too, actually. Um...

40:18.593 --> 40:20.734
I didn't think it was relevant.

40:20.769 --> 40:23.062
You can't decide what's
relevant ever again.

40:23.271 --> 40:25.398
They're looking at modus operandi.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.157
George was shot.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.658
They are looking at motive,

40:28.693 --> 40:30.827
at... at someone who can't control himself,

40:30.862 --> 40:32.328
at revenge, at opportunity.

40:32.364 --> 40:35.281
When would I have had the opportunity, Jon?

40:35.333 --> 40:37.083
Are Teddy and Trey the
only people you've assaulted

40:37.127 --> 40:38.127
since you got out?

40:38.170 --> 40:39.953
Neither without provocation.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.337
Are they the only ones?

40:41.747 --> 40:43.506
Yes.

40:43.531 --> 40:46.292
When you get out of here, out of Dodge,

40:46.294 --> 40:48.461
you have got to get some help.

40:48.463 --> 40:51.297
You've got to see somebody
about your impulse issues...

40:51.349 --> 40:52.599
If we get you out of here.

40:52.634 --> 40:53.767
Of course.

40:53.802 --> 40:55.351
You can't do that to people.

40:55.387 --> 40:57.937
Whatever the provocation,
you can't do that to people!

40:57.973 --> 40:59.022
I'm sorry, Jon.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.307
I'm sorry to put you through this.

41:01.359 --> 41:03.526
You're not putting me
through anything, Daniel.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.811
It's not about me.

41:06.320 --> 41:09.699
Look, setting George
Melton aside for a moment,

41:09.734 --> 41:12.702
if you were ever convicted
of assault of another person,

41:12.737 --> 41:15.085
you would go back to jail for a long time.

41:15.598 --> 41:16.931
Do you understand?

41:17.209 --> 41:18.460
Sure.

41:18.485 --> 41:21.195
That's what you agreed to.
That's the deal you made.

41:21.429 --> 41:23.213
Would that be so bad?

41:23.248 --> 41:24.798
Yeah, it'd be bad! You know why?

41:24.833 --> 41:26.583
'Cause you haven't given this a chance.

41:32.005 --> 41:34.117
We'll pick it back up again tomorrow.

41:40.233 --> 41:41.749
How's your sister doing?

41:42.100 --> 41:44.317
I don't know. She's not here.

41:44.352 --> 41:47.020
She's in Macon... Some training thing.

41:47.022 --> 41:48.960
So she decided to take the job.

41:51.084 --> 41:53.000
Good for her.

41:54.696 --> 41:56.273
Well...

41:57.523 --> 41:59.117
Hang tough, buddy.

41:59.696 --> 42:01.070
Will do, Jon.

42:14.099 --> 42:16.216
[ Footsteps echoing ]

42:36.260 --> 42:37.813
What floor?

42:38.873 --> 42:40.205
Eight.

42:40.453 --> 42:42.320
Above the fray.

42:44.412 --> 42:45.812
[ Chuckles ] [ Elevator bell dings ]

42:54.253 --> 42:56.753
[ Elevator doors close, beeping ]

43:17.373 --> 43:19.540
[ Elevator bell dings ]

43:24.951 --> 43:26.804
Will you come to my room?

43:26.829 --> 43:28.495
I'd love to.
