about this right now,

you because your side

04:13.560 --> 04:15.527
of the country
slept already, huh?

04:15.562 --> 04:17.023
No, no, rest up, sweetheart.

rattlesnake and I kiss it,

04:29.543 --> 04:31.972
and then I kiss your mommy
in her naughty place.

04:32.007 --> 04:33.413

04:35.043 --> 04:37.043

04:48.727 --> 04:49.561
Hello?

04:50.597 --> 04:52.366
Hey.
- Hm, what?

04:53.094 --> 04:56.062
- You, who brought in?

04:56.097 --> 04:57.833
- Brought me in?

04:57.868 --> 05:00.671
- Somebody take care
of this perp, please.

05:00.706 --> 05:03.575
And locate Field Agent Jackson.

05:03.610 --> 05:05.610
- I am Field Agent Jackson.

05:11.552 --> 05:13.585
Yeah, I get that a lot.

05:14.753 --> 05:16.654
- Well, let's hope
looks are deceiving.

05:16.689 --> 05:19.019
I'm Case Officer Connolly,
this is my office.

05:19.054 --> 05:19.855
Get in it.

05:19.890 --> 05:22.759
(air whooshing)

05:24.994 --> 05:26.158
Jackson, I have a problem,

05:26.193 --> 05:27.797
which means now
you have a problem.

05:28.965 --> 05:30.701
There's a cartel kingpin
south of the border.

05:30.736 --> 05:33.671
He's a friend because
nothing really

05:33.706 --> 05:35.068
makes any sense anymore.

05:36.445 --> 05:38.445
So, the truckloads
of pure uncut cocaine

05:38.480 --> 05:41.712
he is trafficking in our
country, not a problem.

05:41.747 --> 05:43.109
This entrepreneur however,

05:43.144 --> 05:45.848
has branched out into
black-market medical supplies,

05:45.883 --> 05:48.851
and that is not bueno.
(fist knocking)

05:48.886 --> 05:49.819
- No esta bien.

05:51.658 --> 05:54.186
- See, our friend is pissing off

05:54.221 --> 05:56.562
some really scary people now.

05:56.597 --> 05:59.565
- Who's scarier than
the Mexican cartel?

05:59.600 --> 06:00.764
- American big Pharma.

06:01.767 --> 06:02.601
- Oh.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.737
Who do we work for again?

06:06.772 --> 06:08.739
- Contraband's already
in the country.

06:08.774 --> 06:09.872
They don't want it in Vegas.

06:09.907 --> 06:10.741
Vegas is a hub.

06:10.776 --> 06:12.204
Spreads out from Vegas.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.679
Remember the not bueno thing?

06:14.714 --> 06:15.780
That's where you come in,

06:15.815 --> 06:18.650
'cause I am told that you
like to do a lotta leg work.

06:18.685 --> 06:20.916
- You know this
is all BS, right?

06:22.249 --> 06:24.117
- I do.
- Hm.

06:24.152 --> 06:25.822
- And I don't care anymore.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.629
What about you, Jackson?

06:31.863 --> 06:32.862
Do you care anymore?

06:34.536 --> 06:35.700
- (inhales) I just
spent the last year

06:35.735 --> 06:36.866
and a half working the border.

06:36.901 --> 06:38.505
It's nearly six a.m.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.068
I'm just a tough ol' dog
looking for a bone to chew on.

06:43.006 --> 06:44.137
I couldn't give a damn.

06:45.514 --> 06:46.843
- Well, looks like
you're my girl.

06:46.878 --> 06:49.747
(pensive music)

06:52.686 --> 06:53.520
- Yay, me.

06:55.656 --> 06:58.118
(air whooshing)

07:02.861 --> 07:04.058
- Oh, hey bud.

07:04.093 --> 07:04.894
- Hey, Mom.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.767
I made cereal already.

07:11.001 --> 07:11.868
- We have milk?

07:11.903 --> 07:16.906
- Mm hm.

07:18.712 --> 07:19.744
(Holly grimaces)

07:19.779 --> 07:20.712
- That's debatable.

07:21.614 --> 07:24.177
- Grandma said a
curse word yesterday.

07:24.212 --> 07:25.046
- Oh, yeah?

07:26.621 --> 07:27.246
What'd she say?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.084
- I'm not falling
for that (laughs).

07:30.119 --> 07:31.723
- (laughs) Get your PT's?

07:31.758 --> 07:32.559
- [Shelby] Mm hm.

07:32.594 --> 07:33.725
- You take your enzymes?

07:33.760 --> 07:34.559
- Mm hm.

07:34.594 --> 07:36.959
- All right, you
get one free pass.

07:38.633 --> 07:39.962
- She said dumb ass.

07:39.997 --> 07:42.833
- Did she call you a
dumb ass or grandpa?

07:42.868 --> 07:43.702
- Grandpa.

07:44.903 --> 07:46.837
- Well, can't argue
with the facts.

07:56.882 --> 07:59.245
Ugh, I think this milk
went bad a long time ago.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.884
- [Shelby] Hm.

08:00.919 --> 08:01.720
- You do your homework?

08:01.755 --> 08:02.754
- [Shelby] Mm hm.

08:02.789 --> 08:03.623
- Okay.

08:05.154 --> 08:06.791
- Those came in this morning.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.091
(somber music)

08:17.331 --> 08:18.836
- I like this shirt on you.

08:18.871 --> 08:20.200
- Thanks.
- Matches your eyes.

08:20.235 --> 08:23.071
(engine rumbling)

08:25.108 --> 08:27.911
(upbeat music)

08:35.624 --> 08:36.590
- Whoa, hey.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.251
Hey, doofus, put that down.

08:38.286 --> 08:39.989
You're gonna throw
your back out.

08:40.024 --> 08:41.089
Let me, okay?

08:42.664 --> 08:43.256
Oh my God.

08:43.291 --> 08:46.259
(Holly laughs)

08:46.294 --> 08:47.296
I got it (grunting).

08:51.167 --> 08:52.705
- Yo, what's up?

08:52.740 --> 08:53.838
- Hey.

08:53.873 --> 08:55.235
I'm gonna be workin'

08:55.270 --> 08:55.702
Gonna be a great campaign.
- Good to see you.

08:55.737 --> 08:57.006
Welcome aboard.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.304
- Thanks, man.
- Good to have you here.

08:58.339 --> 08:59.679
- Appreciate it.
- You got everything you need?

08:59.714 --> 09:00.647
- [Zack] Yeah, I
think we're all good.

09:00.682 --> 09:01.373
- All set?
- Yeah.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.308
- You got it all, everything?

09:02.343 --> 09:03.111
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:03.146 --> 09:04.244
Excited to have you.

09:04.279 --> 09:05.685
Ready to go?
- Yeah, let's do it.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.279
- [Director] Okay,

09:06.314 --> 09:06.879

09:06.915 --> 09:07.984

09:10.790 --> 09:11.823

- All right, man.

09:11.858 --> 09:12.626
- Can't wait.

09:13.827 --> 09:14.826
- [Director] Yep.

09:14.861 --> 09:17.257
(upbeat music)

09:19.360 --> 09:20.766
- Bro, I'm tellin' you,

09:20.801 --> 09:22.295
I'm so done with these
stupid commercials.

09:22.330 --> 09:23.670
It's killin' my image.

09:23.705 --> 09:24.604
Should be starring
in the movies,

09:24.640 --> 09:26.805
not high ho and west
in the desert here.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.675
It's dry, man.

09:28.710 --> 09:29.874
Just get it done, all right?

09:29.909 --> 09:31.337
I'm tired of talking about this.

09:31.372 --> 09:33.977
(mellow music)

09:42.922 --> 09:43.756
- Heads up.

09:48.026 --> 09:49.058
You gotta take a bow.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.298
- Come on.

09:59.169 --> 10:00.399
- Okay.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.367
Hear me out.

10:01.402 --> 10:02.841
- [Tommy] Uh huh?

10:02.876 --> 10:05.173
- I'm thinking, I stay
with the compound set up,

10:05.208 --> 10:09.012
but get this, with
a '72 and a '91.

10:09.047 --> 10:10.442
I mean, how cool would that be?

10:10.477 --> 10:12.983
- Yeah, really cool,

10:13.018 --> 10:14.281
if you like lag.

10:14.316 --> 10:16.019
- Mm, not as much
as I like boost.

10:17.286 --> 10:18.725
What do ya think?

10:18.760 --> 10:20.793
You up for installing it?

10:20.828 --> 10:22.058
I'll make it worth your while.

10:22.093 --> 10:24.731
- I told you already, I
don't want your money.

10:24.766 --> 10:27.701
Working on a truck like this
is all the reward that I need.

10:28.968 --> 10:31.001
Besides, I'm startin' to
feel like you're an addict

10:31.036 --> 10:32.904
and I'm some sort of enabler.

10:32.939 --> 10:34.037
- 50/50.

10:34.072 --> 10:35.467
Split all racing wins.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.238
And that is my final offer

10:37.273 --> 10:38.404
and only because
you're my best friend.

10:38.439 --> 10:39.812
- Because I'm your best friend?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.715
- Mm hm.
- Okay, look, I'm on to you.

10:41.750 --> 10:42.947
You're only offering me half

10:42.982 --> 10:45.015
because you want to race
twice as often, right?

10:45.050 --> 10:46.885
Come on, tell me I'm right.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.150
Come on.

10:48.185 --> 10:50.449
Huh?
- All right, fine, maybe.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.285
But is that a yes?

10:51.320 --> 10:54.420
(Tommy laughs)

10:54.455 --> 10:59.425
(engine rumbling)
(mellow music)

11:03.904 --> 11:07.103
(mellow music continues)

11:18.820 --> 11:20.215
What are you doing?

11:23.924 --> 11:26.287
- Thought I heard an owl.

11:26.322 --> 11:28.124
It's a bad omen
south of the border.

11:29.556 --> 11:34.229
Lechuza, they say she's a
shape-shifting witch looking

11:34.264 --> 11:36.462
for revenge on the
people who wronged her.

11:37.498 --> 11:39.938
- (laughs nervously) Funny.

11:39.973 --> 11:41.203
Okay, can we do this already?

11:42.437 --> 11:43.304
- Such a hurry.

11:44.472 --> 11:46.538
You want to have a
look around the place?

11:46.573 --> 11:48.177
- Somebody's got to
keep the world spinning.

11:48.212 --> 11:49.046
- Yeah.

11:50.082 --> 11:52.544
You know, some people would say

11:52.579 --> 11:56.218
you're wary of being
associated with me.

11:57.419 --> 11:59.320
- Hm, a black-market
medical supply dealer

11:59.355 --> 12:01.190
hiding out in the desert?

12:01.225 --> 12:03.896
What could I possibly
be afraid of?

12:03.931 --> 12:06.063
Besides, you know I roll alone.

12:07.066 --> 12:08.098
- I do.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.968
A fiercely independent woman.

12:10.003 --> 12:10.902
- Fierce.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.564
Well, you try dealing
with a deadbeat ex

12:12.599 --> 12:14.401
who splits as soon as
you get knocked up,

12:14.436 --> 12:16.469
and not getting a little fierce.

12:16.504 --> 12:18.878
- I guess some men just
aren't made for manhood.

12:20.442 --> 12:25.445
Here, look, a free
gift for the kid.

12:27.053 --> 12:29.889
Think of this as a reward
for all your business.

12:33.356 --> 12:37.358
- Uh, Shelby is a boy.

12:37.393 --> 12:38.491
He doesn't play with dolls.

12:38.526 --> 12:40.163
- Oh, boys can't
play with dolls?

12:41.166 --> 12:42.066
(Holly laughs)

12:42.101 --> 12:43.562
- Look, this is a marionette.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.301
- No, that's a puppet, and a
particularly ugly one at that.

12:46.336 --> 12:48.204
- You know what? Just take it.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.076
- You really are the weirdest
outlaw in the world, Renzo.

12:52.111 --> 12:54.309
- Yeah?
- You know that, right?

12:54.344 --> 12:55.948
- Okay, well, exactly
how many other outlaws

12:55.983 --> 12:57.081
are you acquainted with?

12:57.116 --> 12:59.017
- Hm, wouldn't you like to know?

12:59.888 --> 13:00.513
Thank you.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.994
(door creaking)

13:09.029 --> 13:12.030
(siren wailing faintly)

13:12.065 --> 13:15.264
(Agent Jackson sighs)

13:15.299 --> 13:18.102
(pensive music)

13:20.370 --> 13:23.305
(glasses thudding)

13:27.311 --> 13:32.314
(music continues)
(car alarm blaring)

13:41.358 --> 13:45.327
- Do I look okay (laughs)?
- Breathe.

13:45.362 --> 13:47.494
- [Woman Character] Oh,
he shot me (laughs).

13:49.102 --> 13:51.234
- Big cough.
- [Man Character] I think we

13:51.269 --> 13:52.235
could work together here.
(Shelby coughing)

13:52.270 --> 13:53.940
Okay?
(woman character chuckles)

13:53.975 --> 13:55.667
You know, my enemy's the
enemy kinda thing, right?

13:55.702 --> 13:57.240
What do you say?

13:57.275 --> 13:57.974
- [Woman Character]
Am I the only one

13:58.009 --> 14:00.507
that stays in my freakin' lane?

14:00.542 --> 14:02.509
- [Man Character] Yeah, see,
I know where they're goin'.

14:02.544 --> 14:05.281
(toilet flushes)

14:11.421 --> 14:14.158
(pensive music)

14:18.164 --> 14:20.230
(Agent Jackson sighs)

14:20.265 --> 14:23.266
(liquid splashing)

14:26.106 --> 14:27.600
- Lady, I gotta go.

14:27.635 --> 14:28.601
- Mm, uh uh.

14:30.242 --> 14:31.472
No, I want you to stay.

14:33.608 --> 14:35.113
Come on, yeah.

14:35.148 --> 14:36.312
Come on, stay.

14:37.183 --> 14:38.215
Come back.

14:39.284 --> 14:40.283
Come back and then...

14:41.385 --> 14:42.285
That's a good boy.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.386
You stay right there.

14:46.225 --> 14:50.128
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

14:50.163 --> 14:50.997
Don't move.

14:52.166 --> 14:55.265
I just want you to stay and
talk to me for a little, 'kay?

14:59.172 --> 15:03.570
I just need you to
talk to me until

15:03.605 --> 15:06.111
the sun comes up and then...

15:07.774 --> 15:10.478
(Agent Jackson groans)

15:10.513 --> 15:13.283
I need you to, I need
you to distract me, okay?

15:13.318 --> 15:15.351
I just, uh, can you just be

15:15.386 --> 15:17.287
a little bit louder
than they are?

15:18.257 --> 15:20.356
Can you help me, be
just, uh, louder?

15:27.431 --> 15:30.432
(upbeat rock music)

15:31.600 --> 15:36.339
(music continues)
(engine revving)

15:46.351 --> 15:51.354
(music continues)
(revving continues)

15:58.330 --> 15:59.626
- I sent you to school, right?

16:01.267 --> 16:03.102
And when I sent you to school,

16:03.137 --> 16:05.236
they taught you how
numbers work, I assume?

16:05.271 --> 16:06.303
- Oh, boy, here we go again.

16:06.338 --> 16:08.173
- So, what is higher?

16:08.208 --> 16:10.274
150, or 190?

16:10.309 --> 16:12.441
Because right now, I'm kinda
hazy on the whole thing

16:12.476 --> 16:14.773
because I thought
this was a shakedown.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.478
I thought we were gonna
work our way up slowly

16:16.513 --> 16:18.612
on the speed and I thought
we had an agreement

16:18.647 --> 16:21.219
to keep our sponsor who's
been very good to us,

16:21.254 --> 16:23.155
happy by not blowin' up the bike

16:23.190 --> 16:26.125
they pay us to build or turn
it into some shiny lawn dart

16:26.160 --> 16:27.720
out there in the desert.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.557
- In order for it to
be a proper shakedown,

16:29.592 --> 16:32.098
you have to be willing
to shake things up.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.033
- She has a point.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.102
- [Holly's Dad] Slow down, girl.

16:36.137 --> 16:36.762
- [Holly] Can't hear ya.

16:36.797 --> 16:38.335
- I said slow down.

16:38.370 --> 16:39.369
- [Holly] I'm sorry, what?

16:39.404 --> 16:41.074
Can't, can't hear you.

16:41.109 --> 16:42.108
- Slow down.

16:43.309 --> 16:46.079
(engine revving)

16:52.582 --> 16:53.482
That girl's got
the wind up her ass

16:53.517 --> 16:55.253
since the day she was born.

16:56.322 --> 16:57.354
- Yep.

16:58.588 --> 16:59.389
Yep.

16:59.424 --> 17:02.425
(anticipatory music)

17:08.697 --> 17:11.632
(music continues)

17:13.273 --> 17:14.635
- Hello, Miss?

17:14.670 --> 17:16.274
Hey, excuse me.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.573
Excuse me.

17:18.608 --> 17:20.113
Hello.

17:20.148 --> 17:21.312
Hey, excuse me.

17:22.645 --> 17:24.315
Excuse me.

17:24.350 --> 17:25.118
Ma'am?

17:25.153 --> 17:26.284
Hello?

17:26.319 --> 17:28.451
Hey, you just
can't walk in here.

17:28.486 --> 17:31.322
These planes are worth
billions of dollars.

17:31.357 --> 17:34.193
- Right, I wouldn't wanna
ruin a billionaire's day,

17:34.228 --> 17:36.360
especially the
local TV evangelist.

17:36.395 --> 17:38.758
- Can we discuss
this in my office?

17:38.793 --> 17:43.400
- Well, as far as I'm
concerned, this is your office.

17:43.435 --> 17:45.270
- Look, I don't know
who you think you are

17:45.305 --> 17:47.272
but you have no
jurisdiction in here.

17:47.307 --> 17:49.307
- Actually, I do.

17:49.342 --> 17:51.639
You see, you're regional.

17:51.674 --> 17:55.643
That means TSA and CPP,
they can't get in the way.

17:55.678 --> 17:58.283
(chuckles) It's funny,
I actually competed

17:58.318 --> 18:00.285
in farmyard teenage
beauty pageants

18:00.320 --> 18:02.749
that had a tighter
managerial hierarchy

18:02.784 --> 18:05.554
than this glorified
desert lunchbox.

18:05.589 --> 18:06.357
- Screw you.

18:06.392 --> 18:07.457
I'm calling head office.

18:08.427 --> 18:09.723
- How 'bout this?

18:09.758 --> 18:12.198
I'm grounding everything
that's pointy,

18:12.233 --> 18:13.331
expensive and has two wings

18:13.366 --> 18:15.531
until I inspect
it front to back.

18:18.371 --> 18:19.403
- You're just mean.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.671
- If I were you, I'd get lost.

18:23.706 --> 18:24.837
That is, of course,
unless you would like

18:24.872 --> 18:26.410
to make things personal.

18:28.711 --> 18:29.809
- Bitch.

18:29.844 --> 18:31.778
- (smirks) Atta boy.

18:31.813 --> 18:34.913
(anticipatory music)

18:37.819 --> 18:39.687
(music fades)

18:39.722 --> 18:42.723
(keypad beeps)

18:42.758 --> 18:44.923
- Shelby, we're ready for you.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.629
(solemn music)

18:50.436 --> 18:51.864
- Hey, Carol, how you doin'?

18:51.899 --> 18:53.437
- I'm good, thanks.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.439
Listen, we've got a-

18:55.474 --> 18:56.341
- I know.

18:56.376 --> 18:57.738
I'm behind on bills.

18:57.773 --> 18:59.509
- Way behind.

18:59.544 --> 19:02.380
Look, all you have to do is
pay something each month.

19:02.415 --> 19:03.579
Any amount, all right?

19:03.614 --> 19:05.482
Just to show us you're
making an effort.

19:05.517 --> 19:06.549
That's all.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.881
- Yeah, I can do that.

20:08.646 --> 20:09.843
- [Renzo] It's that obvious?

20:11.484 --> 20:14.617
- Well, no gear and you look
like you've just seen a ghost.

20:15.851 --> 20:18.984
No, no, no, don't, don't
tell me there's no meds.

20:19.019 --> 20:21.327
- I saved what I could for ya.

20:21.362 --> 20:23.362
I know it's not that
much, just take it.

20:25.828 --> 20:27.465
Keep the money, keep the money.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.499
Just take it.

20:31.570 --> 20:33.504
- You're gonna get a new
supply in, though, right?

20:33.539 --> 20:34.802
- I don't know.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.870
I don't know.

20:36.905 --> 20:38.674
All the local pilots are
freaking out right now.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.511
If I can't get
supplies to Vegas,

20:40.546 --> 20:43.679
I break this chain,
everything stops, all right?

20:43.714 --> 20:45.714
I'm telling you now so
you can make other plans.

20:45.749 --> 20:47.914
- (scoffs) other plans.

20:47.949 --> 20:49.388
What other plans?

20:50.688 --> 20:52.490
I can't afford legal meds.

20:52.525 --> 20:53.590
And you're my only hookup.

20:54.824 --> 20:58.991
- All right, just
give me one week.

20:59.026 --> 21:02.401
Stay in contact and I'll do my
best to figure something out.

21:06.374 --> 21:09.375
It's the timing that's
the problem here, okay?

21:09.410 --> 21:10.607
There is a three-hour window

21:10.642 --> 21:11.674
to move everything
and that's it.

21:11.709 --> 21:12.675
The deal implodes.

21:14.910 --> 21:17.878
Don't give up on me
just yet, all right?

21:17.913 --> 21:19.385
We'll figure it out.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.882
(pensive music)

21:27.626 --> 21:30.660
(upbeat music)

21:30.695 --> 21:34.631
- That is a fuel pump rod
stuck in the block all right.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.667
(sighs) All right, great.

21:37.702 --> 21:39.537
- Oh, it wouldn't be
a proper job, Tommy,

21:39.572 --> 21:42.067
unless a two-minute job
turned into a two-hour job.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.442
- Mm hm.
(glasses clinking)

21:43.477 --> 21:44.674
- You can work it out?

21:44.709 --> 21:45.741
- Let's see.

21:46.944 --> 21:49.580
- At least we get to spend some
time together for once, huh?

21:50.715 --> 21:51.945
Because Shelby's been spendin'

21:51.980 --> 21:54.079
a lotta time with
his grandma lately.

21:54.114 --> 21:57.016
- Yeah, I've been pullin'
a lot of overtime, Dad.

21:57.051 --> 21:58.589
I have to get these hours in.

21:58.624 --> 21:59.425
- And you will.

22:00.659 --> 22:02.725
I'm gonna get you into
the union if it kills me.

22:02.760 --> 22:06.729
- Teamsters union has the
best medical packages.

22:06.764 --> 22:08.027
You got to compete, though.

22:08.062 --> 22:10.502
I mean, with the whole
gig economy and all that.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.405
- That's what
they're calling it.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.506
Well, as long as it's
all legit, right?

22:14.541 --> 22:15.507
Nothing illegal?

22:16.873 --> 22:18.708
Because I wouldn't want you
two out on the street racin'

22:18.743 --> 22:21.073
for pinks or anything
stupid like that.

22:22.483 --> 22:26.782
- Yeah, um, because that
would be very stupid.

22:26.817 --> 22:28.619
- Super stupid.

22:28.654 --> 22:31.556
- But hey, you know, at
least we're not doing

22:31.591 --> 22:32.854
the old Silver
Trails 300 anymore

22:32.889 --> 22:34.757
'cause that was really sketchy.

22:36.728 --> 22:38.662
- What's the Silver Trails 300?

22:38.697 --> 22:39.762
- Don't ask, Dad.

22:43.603 --> 22:44.734
- Okay, then, I won't.

22:46.705 --> 22:47.537
I think we can probably pry

22:47.573 --> 22:49.442
this out with a
ring spanner, Tommy.

22:49.477 --> 22:52.203
It's an old trick I used to
use in big-box Chevelle's.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.512
- All right.

22:53.547 --> 22:54.513
- You know what a
ring spanner is?

22:54.548 --> 22:55.910
- (laughs) Yeah, I know
what a ring spanner is.

22:55.945 --> 22:56.845
- You have a ring spanner Tommy?

22:56.880 --> 22:57.912
- Yes, I have a ring spanner.

22:57.947 --> 22:59.419
- Why don't ya go get it?

23:00.048 --> 23:00.882
Now.

23:02.248 --> 23:03.049
Thank you.

23:03.084 --> 23:06.492
(upbeat music playing)

23:07.792 --> 23:11.024
Hey, are you okay?

23:11.059 --> 23:12.498
- I'm good.

23:12.533 --> 23:15.226
No, I just figured
out what we needed.

23:15.261 --> 23:16.062
- [Holly's Dad] What?

23:16.097 --> 23:16.898
- More beer.

23:18.737 --> 23:19.835
- Now you're cookin'.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.673
- Pop.

23:22.708 --> 23:24.136
- That is why she's the
brains of the operation

23:24.171 --> 23:26.677
and you and I are not.

23:26.712 --> 23:28.943
(Holly laughs)

23:28.978 --> 23:31.209
(lid pops)
(air whooshing)

23:31.244 --> 23:33.585
(phone ringing)

23:33.620 --> 23:35.653
(pensive music)

23:35.688 --> 23:36.819
- Go for Jackson.

23:36.854 --> 23:37.919
- Jackson, Connolly.

23:39.087 --> 23:40.526
Listen, I was just
calling to tell you,

23:40.561 --> 23:42.759
you're doing a great
job with the planes.

23:42.794 --> 23:44.057
Surveillance says
that the runners

23:44.092 --> 23:45.828
are refusing to move product.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.666
I'm impressed.

23:48.701 --> 23:50.129
- Listen, the smugglers
will be back up

23:50.164 --> 23:52.769
and running before you
know so don't you worry.

23:52.804 --> 23:54.771
- Yeah, about that, I just
got a call from up top

23:54.806 --> 23:58.544
and apparently we're being
a little too effective.

23:58.579 --> 24:01.679
We're interfering with our
friends' other operations.

24:01.714 --> 24:03.175
I'm gonna need you to slow down.

24:03.210 --> 24:05.518
- Listen, I haven't even
gathered any evidence yet

24:05.553 --> 24:07.047
so I'll slow down once I
know this thing is shut down.

24:07.082 --> 24:09.720
- You'll slow down right
now like I just told you to.

24:09.755 --> 24:12.756
That is in order.
(boxes thudding)

24:12.791 --> 24:14.659
What the hell was that?

24:14.694 --> 24:15.286
- A box.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.255
Um, a box just fell.

24:18.764 --> 24:20.192
Okay.

24:20.227 --> 24:22.568
I'll get the paperwork
gathered up for you then.

24:22.603 --> 24:23.228
- Good.

24:24.737 --> 24:25.934
You do good work.

24:26.871 --> 24:27.903
You're an asset.

24:30.303 --> 24:33.139
(engine rumbling)

24:36.650 --> 24:39.717
(anticipatory music)

24:47.595 --> 24:49.859
(window thuds)

24:49.894 --> 24:51.124
- Jeez, Renzo.

24:51.159 --> 24:52.631
You scared the hell out of me.

24:52.666 --> 24:54.666
- You're the one
showin' up unannounced.

24:56.362 --> 24:57.834
- Got any bourbon in there?

24:57.869 --> 25:00.034
After that I could
use a stiff drink.

25:00.069 --> 25:03.037
- You should probably
call before you visit.

25:03.072 --> 25:07.272
- Well, I'm sorry to intrude
but I have a proposal for you.

25:10.981 --> 25:12.849
About a year ago, we
were working on this set

25:12.884 --> 25:15.313
with some really shady
investors from Vegas.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.787
They would have us run
things back and forth

25:16.822 --> 25:18.118
from there overnight.

25:18.153 --> 25:20.120
People, packages.

25:20.155 --> 25:21.957
We never knew who or
what we were moving.

25:21.992 --> 25:23.794
We just knew not
to ask questions

25:23.829 --> 25:25.763
and not to get
stopped by the cops.

25:25.798 --> 25:27.028
We had this system going.

25:27.063 --> 25:28.931
It was called the
Silver Trails 300.

25:30.099 --> 25:31.835
You have Route 62,

25:31.870 --> 25:34.706
we head east, swing up, 95,

25:35.841 --> 25:36.939
all the way to Vegas.

25:37.975 --> 25:38.809
300 miles.

25:38.844 --> 25:40.239
- Okay.

25:40.274 --> 25:41.911
Five hour drive, give or take.

25:41.946 --> 25:43.913
- If you're playing
by the rules,

25:43.948 --> 25:45.948
yeah, it's about five hours.

25:45.983 --> 25:47.851
But what most people don't
know is there's a gap

25:47.886 --> 25:50.348
in the state police shift
change at the border.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.955
You time it right, run it like
you mean it the whole way,

25:52.990 --> 25:55.254
average three
digits, no pit stops,

25:55.289 --> 25:56.695
you can make it in three hours

25:56.730 --> 25:58.323
and the cops'll never
know you were there.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.362
- You're suggesting you run
my contraband up the highway?

26:04.397 --> 26:05.803
- If it frees up this chain

26:05.838 --> 26:07.068
and keep things
moving, then yes.

26:08.104 --> 26:09.906
Unless you have a better idea?

26:09.941 --> 26:12.711
Because right now, it's my
little boy's life on the line.

26:12.746 --> 26:13.976
- I respect that, okay?

26:14.011 --> 26:16.847
But there is a massive
flaw in your plan.

26:16.882 --> 26:19.883
You wanna move a package,
a person in a sports car,

26:19.918 --> 26:21.313
that's easy, okay?

26:21.348 --> 26:23.414
But we're talking about a
weighty amount of product here.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.382
- Hm.

26:24.417 --> 26:25.757
Let me give you a tour.

26:30.060 --> 26:32.258
650 horsepower to the wheels.

26:32.293 --> 26:33.996
Over 1,000 foot
pounds of torque.

26:36.363 --> 26:39.166
Fuel tanks take the
best of 50 gallons easy.

26:39.201 --> 26:42.169
She'll run low elevens all day
long even in the midday heat.

26:42.204 --> 26:43.269
Oh, check this out.

26:46.373 --> 26:47.845
Load her up with five tons,

26:47.880 --> 26:50.375
she'll just lay back,
cackle and pull even harder.

26:52.918 --> 26:55.182
- Well, she's anything
but inconspicuous.

26:55.217 --> 26:57.085
- Oh, I'm not done yet.

27:00.057 --> 27:02.255
I don't like getting any
attention I don't want.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.962
On the streets, they
call her the Night Train.

27:07.163 --> 27:09.834
Personally, I like to
call her Black Bess.

27:10.837 --> 27:11.836
- Dick Turpin's horse?

27:11.871 --> 27:13.970
- (chuckles) What can I say?

27:14.005 --> 27:14.905
I like my highwaymen.

27:17.074 --> 27:19.910
Look, I want my fuel covered

27:19.945 --> 27:22.242
and I want the meds I
normally receive for free.

27:22.277 --> 27:23.914
I'll get your
medication to Vegas

27:23.949 --> 27:25.949
and I will make planes
look slow in the process.

27:27.348 --> 27:29.447
- You're making it
really hard to say no.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.822
- Then give me a yes.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.326
- Meet me on the access
road by the wind farm.

27:40.361 --> 27:41.833
(anticipatory music)

27:41.868 --> 27:44.000
Keeps the sky clear
of any helicopters.

27:44.035 --> 27:44.935
Speak to no one.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.937
My men'll know the drill.

27:46.972 --> 27:48.202
- [Holly] Will they be armed?

27:48.237 --> 27:49.973
- [Renzo] Assume
everyone you meet over

27:50.008 --> 27:51.777
the next 24 hours is armed.

27:52.978 --> 27:54.142
I wish I could go with you

27:54.177 --> 27:57.442
but Vegas has far
too many cameras.

27:57.477 --> 27:58.949
- [Holly] I think I'll be okay.

27:58.984 --> 28:01.050
I've done this a million times.

28:01.085 --> 28:03.019
- [Renzo] Not for
people like this.

28:04.022 --> 28:05.055
When you get to Vegas,

28:05.090 --> 28:08.321
you head to the loading
dock at the Westgate Hotel.

28:08.356 --> 28:10.356
Our contact loves to
live the high life.

28:11.458 --> 28:13.491
Again, talk to nobody.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.998
You'll be given
the money in a bag,

28:15.033 --> 28:17.033
you take it and you
head straight home.

28:17.068 --> 28:19.464
(dramatic music)

28:19.499 --> 28:20.905
Be careful.

28:20.940 --> 28:25.338
(music continues)
(train rattling)

28:32.050 --> 28:34.886
(music continues)

28:41.928 --> 28:44.764
(music continues)

28:51.234 --> 28:54.037
(mellow music)

29:01.948 --> 29:04.784
(music continues)

29:11.925 --> 29:14.552
(music continues)

29:21.968 --> 29:24.804
(music continues)

29:33.078 --> 29:36.112
(music continues)

29:37.247 --> 29:38.048
- Whoa!

29:38.083 --> 29:41.117
(music continues)

29:51.195 --> 29:54.064
(fist knocking)

29:56.167 --> 29:58.299
- Mr. Maxwell wants
to speak to you.

29:58.334 --> 29:59.432
- I have to get
back on the road.

29:59.467 --> 30:02.006
- It's nonnegotiable, honey.

30:03.141 --> 30:05.504
(mellow music)

30:14.020 --> 30:16.856
(music continues)

30:20.389 --> 30:22.224
(crowd chattering)

30:22.259 --> 30:23.621
(dice clattering)

30:23.656 --> 30:26.294
(all cheering)

30:26.329 --> 30:29.099
(Mr. Maxwell laughs)

30:29.134 --> 30:30.067
- Yes!

30:30.102 --> 30:32.201
- Somebody wanted to see me?

30:32.236 --> 30:34.907
(pensive music)

30:38.946 --> 30:41.210
(air whooshing)

30:41.245 --> 30:44.444
(gentle classical music)

30:48.681 --> 30:52.221
(Mr. Maxwell sighs)

30:52.256 --> 30:54.322
- I'm not a man who
likes to mince words.

30:55.523 --> 30:57.127
I like to tell it like it is.

30:58.460 --> 31:02.429
I like country girls.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.136
Y'all are a different breed.

31:07.601 --> 31:10.569
Women here, they're like
blowup dolls with a pulse.

31:12.276 --> 31:17.246
So, I was wondering if
you might wanna hang out,

31:18.645 --> 31:21.250
make a little extra,
have some fun?

31:21.285 --> 31:22.317
Hm?

31:24.255 --> 31:27.190
- (exhales) I'm
just here to drive.

31:29.326 --> 31:31.689
And I have a really long
night ahead of me, so I...

31:33.066 --> 31:34.494
- Can't blame a man
for asking, right?

31:35.332 --> 31:39.070
(Holly smirks softly)

31:39.105 --> 31:43.206
By the way, I wanted to
give you this, a bonus.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.144
We were in a tight
spot and I understand

31:47.179 --> 31:48.343
that you did the impossible.

31:49.511 --> 31:51.511
Consider it a personal
thank you from me.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.550
I also wanna give
you my cell number

31:58.718 --> 32:00.289
in case you run
into any trouble,

32:02.326 --> 32:03.622
or if you change your mind.

32:09.366 --> 32:10.167
- Thank you.

32:10.202 --> 32:11.135
- Hm.

32:12.435 --> 32:15.535
- Wait, I'm sorry, I'm gonna
need you to repeat that.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.009
- I said we just received word,

32:17.044 --> 32:18.505
another shipment
has reached Vegas.

32:18.540 --> 32:20.738
- Well, I hate to
say I told you so.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.081
- Not as much as I hate
to hear you say it.

32:23.116 --> 32:25.083
You're back on, Jackson.

32:25.118 --> 32:26.579
- Yeesh, I'm pullin' on
so many U-turns here,

32:26.614 --> 32:29.186
I'm beginning to think that
I'm competing in NASCAR.

32:29.221 --> 32:31.122
- We got a leak on
the receiving side.

32:31.157 --> 32:34.323
Apparently, the shipment
came in at night via train.

32:34.358 --> 32:35.753
- Via train?

32:35.788 --> 32:36.854
I'm not sure that adds up.

32:36.889 --> 32:40.428
Well, looks like I'm goin'
on another wild goose chase.

32:40.463 --> 32:41.627
- Okay, then, you do that,

32:41.662 --> 32:43.200
and Jackson, lose the attitude.

32:43.235 --> 32:44.795
Things change when
the information does.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.269
You should know that by now.

32:46.304 --> 32:47.567
- And you should try
to find someone else

32:47.602 --> 32:48.733
who's willing to run
around the desert

32:48.768 --> 32:50.174
doing your dirty work.

32:50.209 --> 32:51.274
Better yet, maybe
you should go after

32:51.309 --> 32:52.638
a big dog on your own turf

32:52.673 --> 32:54.607
rather than barking
at little ole me.

32:54.642 --> 32:55.608
- Just get it done.

32:56.776 --> 32:59.447
(pensive music)

33:07.325 --> 33:10.326
(music continues)

33:17.467 --> 33:20.435
(music continues)

33:27.675 --> 33:29.477
(music continues)

33:29.512 --> 33:31.479
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

33:31.514 --> 33:33.316
I bet with the beast like
that no one ever gives

33:33.351 --> 33:34.449
you crap on the road, huh?

33:35.749 --> 33:38.387
- Yeah, they do tend
to see me coming.

33:38.422 --> 33:40.092
- Hm, I should upgrade.

33:41.293 --> 33:43.557

Well, don't get too excited.

You saying I can't handle
it because I'm a girl?

35:27.366 --> 35:28.794

I just don't wanna see you
become a fully-fledged criminal.

35:33.933 --> 35:37.374

Maxwell gave me a bonus.

Handed it to me himself.

something in return.

turn down a gift like that?

36:42.606 --> 36:43.506

46:08.072 --> 46:10.941
Your stuff wasn't
stolen, doofus.

46:10.976 --> 46:11.810
It was hidden.

46:13.374 --> 46:14.406
She was trying to protect you.

46:14.441 --> 46:18.344
- (scoffs) My personal items?

46:18.379 --> 46:20.181
(Zack sniffs)

46:20.216 --> 46:22.018
- I don't know
anything about that.

46:22.053 --> 46:23.118
You know what?

46:23.153 --> 46:24.052
We're done here.

46:24.088 --> 46:25.516
We're finishing this
commercial without you.

46:25.551 --> 46:26.550
(Zack laughs)

46:26.585 --> 46:27.386
- You can't do that.

46:27.421 --> 46:28.618
- Watch me.

46:28.653 --> 46:29.553
I've been waiting for an excuse

46:29.588 --> 46:31.357
to fire your ass from day one.

46:32.525 --> 46:35.229
And hey, I bought
that jacket myself.

46:35.264 --> 46:36.329
- [Zack] That's mine.

46:38.036 --> 46:39.035
- [Tommy] Escort this jackass

46:39.070 --> 46:40.103
and get him off the set please.

46:40.138 --> 46:42.500
- Hey, congrats on your
Pinto commercial, Spielberg.

46:42.535 --> 46:44.634
I hope it's a hit.

46:44.669 --> 46:47.505
(director sniffs)

46:50.081 --> 46:52.950
(mellow music)

46:57.616 --> 47:00.551
(music continues)

47:13.236 --> 47:16.072
(engine rumbling)

47:17.504 --> 47:20.274
(energetic music)

47:28.086 --> 47:30.922
(music continues)

47:37.359 --> 47:40.195
(music continues)

47:47.567 --> 47:49.204
- [Radio Operator]
Try to sneak one more

47:49.239 --> 47:51.470
and then let's see a little
more (speaking faintly).

47:51.505 --> 47:52.306
(radio beeps)

47:52.341 --> 47:55.177
(energetic music)

48:03.121 --> 48:05.957
(music continues)

48:12.295 --> 48:14.526
(alarm beeping)

48:14.561 --> 48:19.498
(siren wailing)
(upbeat music)

48:27.640 --> 48:30.476
(music continues)

48:33.745 --> 48:36.482
(engine revving)

48:37.452 --> 48:40.288
(music continues)

48:41.588 --> 48:44.424
(tires squealing)

48:47.297 --> 48:49.330
(music continues)

48:49.365 --> 48:52.036
(siren wailing continues)

48:52.071 --> 48:54.137
(tires squealing)

48:54.172 --> 48:57.008
(music continues)

49:01.245 --> 49:03.707
(Holly exhales)

49:05.282 --> 49:08.316
(music continues)

49:11.519 --> 49:13.222
(indistinct radio chattering)

49:13.257 --> 49:14.652
(radio beeps)

49:14.687 --> 49:17.523
(music continues)

49:28.668 --> 49:30.272
- [Man] Boss wants to see you.

49:30.307 --> 49:33.374
(anticipatory music)

49:41.681 --> 49:44.517
(music continues)

49:51.196 --> 49:53.658
(line trilling)

49:57.565 --> 49:58.366
- [Shelby] Mom?

49:58.401 --> 49:59.532
- Hey.

49:59.567 --> 50:01.072
How you doin'?

50:01.107 --> 50:02.403
- [Shelby] I was sleeping.

50:03.439 --> 50:07.342
- I know, I just needed
to hear your voice.

50:08.642 --> 50:10.279
- [Shelby] Where are you?

50:10.314 --> 50:11.544
- I'll be home soon, bud.

50:13.416 --> 50:14.580
I'll be home soon.

50:14.615 --> 50:17.385
(mellow music)

50:19.290 --> 50:23.358
(dispatcher chattering faintly)

50:27.562 --> 50:30.398
(music continues)

50:36.406 --> 50:38.142
- [Agent Jackson] It's you.

50:38.177 --> 50:38.769
- Thanks, buddy.

50:38.804 --> 50:39.638
I owe you one.

50:40.608 --> 50:41.673
(Agent Connolly sniffs)

50:41.708 --> 50:43.345
(Agent Connolly exhales)

50:43.380 --> 50:45.479
(Agent Jackson sniffs)

50:45.514 --> 50:46.414
You on a stakeout?

50:48.319 --> 50:49.153
You undercover?

50:50.453 --> 50:52.321
Under the influence.

50:53.324 --> 50:58.261
- You know, you're a
real piece of work.

50:58.296 --> 50:59.462
(chuckles) Yeah.

50:59.497 --> 51:04.630
You see, you got one person
working alone with no resources,

51:05.732 --> 51:07.435
no leads that
actually go anywhere.

51:07.470 --> 51:12.110
And now (chuckles) I have to
search every pickup truck.

51:13.707 --> 51:15.410
(Agent Jackson chuckles)

51:15.445 --> 51:18.347
(sniffles) And boy, do we
love our pickup trucks.

51:19.548 --> 51:24.551
(sighs) You are asking
me to do the impossible.

51:25.752 --> 51:27.455
And to top it off (chuckles),

51:27.490 --> 51:30.425
you can't even decide
what that impossible

51:30.460 --> 51:31.690
thing is that you want.

51:35.234 --> 51:37.531
- Well, that's a sob story.

51:39.337 --> 51:44.340
- I just work and work and work.

51:47.411 --> 51:49.477
I just can't lay down roots.

51:49.512 --> 51:52.183
I can't make friends,
and for what?

51:52.218 --> 51:54.746
(laughs) To help people?

51:54.781 --> 51:58.519
The people that I want
to help can't be helped.

51:58.554 --> 52:01.423
They're just a lost cause,

52:01.458 --> 52:04.261
chronically
self-destructive (laughs).

52:05.528 --> 52:07.462
- Hey, there's somethin'
you know about.

52:09.532 --> 52:11.532
Self-destructive behavior.

52:11.567 --> 52:13.534
I mean, look, I'm not
makin' fun of PTSD.

52:13.569 --> 52:15.536
That's something serious.

52:15.571 --> 52:18.473
Yeah, I know about
your little incident.

52:18.508 --> 52:20.277
I read it in your
psych evaluation.

52:21.478 --> 52:22.110
Ooph.

52:23.348 --> 52:25.612
- You don't know what went down.

52:26.747 --> 52:29.451
(sighs) We knew
that the insurgents

52:29.486 --> 52:32.454
liked to pose as
civilians, okay?

52:32.489 --> 52:33.488
We knew that.

52:34.491 --> 52:35.754
You know?

52:35.789 --> 52:39.692
(sighs) We thought we
had good intelligence.

52:39.727 --> 52:43.630
They told us not to
leave any witnesses.

52:43.665 --> 52:45.731
They said, they said
that was an order.

52:46.602 --> 52:47.766
- That's right.

52:47.801 --> 52:50.373
It was in order, and
you follow your orders.

52:50.408 --> 52:51.374
That's what you do.

52:57.514 --> 52:59.448
You think you're the
only one who's figured

52:59.483 --> 53:01.417
out their working
for the machine.

53:04.752 --> 53:06.356
Yeah, I sleep fine at night.

53:10.593 --> 53:11.625
- You don't have to look them

53:11.660 --> 53:13.627
in the eyes every
night like I do.

53:13.662 --> 53:15.497
- Yeah, there it is.

53:16.665 --> 53:17.697
That's my girl.

53:18.964 --> 53:19.864
What is that, huh?

53:22.671 --> 53:24.440
Hm?

53:24.475 --> 53:25.309
Guilt?

53:27.071 --> 53:28.609
I don't see it that way.

53:29.843 --> 53:31.876
I think you love it,
I think you need it.

53:31.911 --> 53:33.548
I think you want
it because that's

53:33.583 --> 53:35.979
the only feeling that you
even can feel anymore.

53:38.390 --> 53:39.983
Dead inside.

53:40.018 --> 53:41.523
Oh, I can trust the guilt.

53:44.561 --> 53:45.989
That's why you work for me.

53:47.597 --> 53:49.333
And it ain't the paycheck.

53:51.865 --> 53:55.867
(Agent Jackson laughs)

53:55.902 --> 53:57.572
Or are you just scared?

53:58.872 --> 54:01.642
'Cause I mean, who's gonna
want a washed up old vet?

54:04.614 --> 54:05.910
I do.

54:05.945 --> 54:06.779
I do.

54:11.049 --> 54:13.522
(Agent Jackson exhales)

54:13.557 --> 54:17.823
We're gonna have a nice long
relationship, me and you.

54:25.404 --> 54:28.405
You know, town's,
uh, it's that way.

54:32.510 --> 54:33.806
(Agent Jackson's tongue clicks)

54:33.841 --> 54:36.611
(pensive music)

54:44.115 --> 54:46.654
(tires squealing)

54:46.689 --> 54:49.525
(music continues)

54:53.663 --> 54:56.334
(phone ringing)

54:59.966 --> 55:02.670
(Holly sighs)

55:03.706 --> 55:05.739
- Look, I got your
letters, okay?

55:05.774 --> 55:06.905
I'm working on it.

55:06.940 --> 55:08.577
I will get you the
money as soon as I can.

55:09.745 --> 55:10.909
I have to get back to work.

55:15.718 --> 55:18.587
(phone ringing)

55:19.887 --> 55:21.557
You'll get your money, okay?

55:22.659 --> 55:25.627
- [Mr. Maxwell] Oh, I
don't want your money.

55:26.696 --> 55:29.367
You know what I want from you.

55:30.601 --> 55:32.766
So, when are you gonna
pay me another visit?

55:33.670 --> 55:35.637
- How did you get my number?

55:35.672 --> 55:39.135
- Oh, I have my fingers and
a lot of pies, Miss McCord.

55:39.170 --> 55:42.413
I hope I see you
again in Vegas soon.

55:42.448 --> 55:45.713
I do so miss the
smell of the country.

55:48.718 --> 55:53.050
(glass clinks)
(upbeat music)

55:53.085 --> 55:55.756
(pensive music)

56:04.536 --> 56:05.832
(Holly sighs)

56:05.867 --> 56:08.703
(music continues)

56:13.743 --> 56:14.577
- Mom?

56:17.681 --> 56:18.944
Shelby?

56:18.979 --> 56:20.715
- [Renzo] Taking care
of that nasty bear.

56:20.750 --> 56:22.013
- [Shelby] Yeah, you nasty bear.

56:22.048 --> 56:24.719
- [Renzo] Wait, no,
he's not quite dead yet.

56:24.754 --> 56:25.951
- [Shelby] Okay.

56:25.986 --> 56:29.119
- Shelby, go check
on grandma, please.

56:29.154 --> 56:32.463
(anticipatory music)

56:36.700 --> 56:38.194
- Hey.

56:38.229 --> 56:39.734
- What are you doing here?

56:40.704 --> 56:42.165
- I did the math and you're due

56:42.200 --> 56:43.705
to run out of
antibiotics today so-

56:43.740 --> 56:45.740
- So, call.

56:45.775 --> 56:46.741
- (sighs) Come on.

56:47.843 --> 56:49.106
I called.

56:49.141 --> 56:50.481
You weren't picking up.

56:51.176 --> 56:53.847
Look, he needs his medication.

56:53.882 --> 56:55.046
So-

56:55.081 --> 56:56.520
- So you just come
into my house?

56:56.555 --> 56:57.653
- What do ya want me
to do, wait outside?

56:58.590 --> 56:59.820
I'm a wanted man.

56:59.855 --> 57:00.689
You know that.

57:01.857 --> 57:02.988
- How did you even
know where I lived?

57:04.563 --> 57:07.058
Oh, you had your boys
follow me home, didn't you?

57:07.093 --> 57:09.962
- Have you taken any more
money from our mutual friend?

57:09.997 --> 57:11.865
- Okay, listen, I
appreciate you stopping by

57:11.900 --> 57:15.231
and playing happy little
family with my son.

57:15.266 --> 57:17.233
I've hitched my wagon
to wild horses before

57:17.268 --> 57:19.939
and I've learned that
they always break free.

57:21.140 --> 57:22.678
Please leave.

57:22.713 --> 57:25.483
When there's business to
be done, I'll contact you.

57:28.213 --> 57:29.817
- You know what?

57:29.852 --> 57:31.984
Bad debts never take
care of good debts.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.792
Maybe it's you who's
the wild horse.

57:43.294 --> 57:45.965
(pensive music)

57:52.809 --> 57:54.072
- (grunts) There we go.

57:54.107 --> 57:54.908
(Tommy's head thuds)

57:54.943 --> 57:55.777
Ow. God!

57:56.912 --> 57:57.746
Ah!

57:58.947 --> 57:59.781
- Tough day?

58:02.049 --> 58:03.213
- Is there any other kind?

58:03.248 --> 58:04.082
- [Agent Jackson] Hm.

58:05.052 --> 58:07.151
- What can I help you with?

58:07.186 --> 58:10.726
- [Agent Jackson] You guys tune
diesel engines here, right?

58:10.761 --> 58:11.793
- That we do.

58:12.896 --> 58:16.325
We tune pretty much everything
except for pianos here.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.799
- Word on the street is you're

58:17.834 --> 58:19.768
the hottest tuning
shop in the state.

58:19.803 --> 58:22.606
- I don't know about
that but, yeah, we try.

58:22.641 --> 58:23.266
- Huh.

58:24.676 --> 58:25.939
Let me ask you a hypothetical.

58:27.074 --> 58:29.745
Could you take a
truck that can carry,

58:29.780 --> 58:31.813
say, four, maybe
five tons and soup

58:31.848 --> 58:34.178
that thing up so it
goes a 100 miles an hour

58:34.213 --> 58:36.818
for three hours
without stopping?

58:36.853 --> 58:37.951
Not even to refuel?

58:39.185 --> 58:42.923
- That is a very
specific request.

58:42.958 --> 58:47.961
Uh, but, yeah,
anything's possible.

58:48.931 --> 58:50.898
Can I ask why?

58:52.330 --> 58:57.333
- Well, I'm just
asking questions.

59:00.305 --> 59:01.777
Theorizing.

59:01.812 --> 59:02.877
- [Tommy] Theorizing.

59:02.912 --> 59:03.878
- Postulating.

59:05.211 --> 59:06.914
You know how it is.

59:09.083 --> 59:10.720
- Yeah.

59:10.755 --> 59:12.150
I know exactly how it is.

59:13.824 --> 59:18.959
(clicks tongue) Anyway, uh,
you are on private property.

59:20.226 --> 59:24.261
Unless you want to arrest
me, you gonna arrest me?

59:26.166 --> 59:27.396
No?

59:27.431 --> 59:28.837
Okay, then I guess I
don't have to answer

59:28.872 --> 59:30.806
anymore of your
dumb ass questions.

59:31.974 --> 59:34.975
So, why don't you get
lost and come back

59:35.010 --> 59:36.911
when you have some sort
of warrant or somethin'?

59:36.946 --> 59:39.947
(music intensifies)

59:42.347 --> 59:43.984
- [Agent Jackson] I'll
see myself out then.

59:44.019 --> 59:46.954
(music continues)

59:50.927 --> 59:53.862
- Look at my castle, Princess.

59:53.897 --> 59:54.830
Case closed.

59:54.865 --> 59:58.130
(dramatic music)

59:58.165 --> 59:59.769
- Now remember what I said,

59:59.804 --> 1:00:04.037
we're gonna start
off at 150, 1-5-0.

1:00:04.072 --> 1:00:05.874
And we're gonna
bring the speed up

1:00:05.909 --> 1:00:08.404
from there provided
she's steering on
your fingertips, okay?

1:00:08.439 --> 1:00:09.911
Understand?

1:00:09.946 --> 1:00:11.341
You can give me the stink
eye all you want, girl.

1:00:11.376 --> 1:00:12.914
You know I'm right.

1:00:12.949 --> 1:00:14.245

Cuts and bruises.

1:03:17.903 --> 1:03:19.166
You crash your bike
at 200 miles an hour

1:03:19.201 --> 1:03:21.036
and you walk away
with cuts and bruises.

1:03:21.071 --> 1:03:23.170
I don't know how
you do it, kiddo.

1:03:23.205 --> 1:03:25.106

1:03:33.083 --> 1:03:34.313

1:03:37.384 --> 1:03:41.958
So, you and me, we need
to have a conversation.

1:03:45.062 --> 1:03:48.932
The bike's a mess, but you can
bang metal back into shape.

1:03:48.967 --> 1:03:52.067
People (sighs), not so much.

1:03:53.235 --> 1:03:56.137
I was thinking, remember
your first go-cart?

1:03:57.107 --> 1:03:58.337
- Dad, not this story again.

1:03:58.372 --> 1:04:01.945
- (laughs) You were
eight years old.

1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:03.342
We spent months
building that thing

1:04:03.377 --> 1:04:05.146
and on the day that we finished,

1:04:05.181 --> 1:04:07.214
you take it to the
steepest hill in town.

1:04:07.249 --> 1:04:09.183
- The steepest
hill in the suburb.

1:04:09.218 --> 1:04:10.283
You always exaggerate.

1:04:10.318 --> 1:04:11.515
- It was the
steepest hill in town

1:04:11.550 --> 1:04:14.089
and you proceed to crash
it into a tree trying

1:04:14.124 --> 1:04:17.521
to prove to some kid that
you were the fastest.

1:04:17.556 --> 1:04:19.358
- He was a bully.

1:04:19.393 --> 1:04:21.624
His fat ass needed to
be taught a lesson.

1:04:21.659 --> 1:04:24.165
And remember, I crossed
the finish line first.

1:04:26.334 --> 1:04:29.368
And maybe if someone
had put a shoot on,

1:04:29.403 --> 1:04:30.941
I would've slowed down.

1:04:30.976 --> 1:04:33.240
- Oh, so that was my fault.

1:04:33.275 --> 1:04:34.109
I'm sorry.

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:38.179
- I'm not a kid anymore, Pop.

1:04:40.183 --> 1:04:41.677
- No, I know you're not.

1:04:44.055 --> 1:04:45.516
But you're still
the same person.

1:04:47.058 --> 1:04:47.958
Nothing's changing that.

1:04:47.993 --> 1:04:49.190
Nothing should change that

1:04:49.225 --> 1:04:52.996
because age takes
the edge off of ya.

1:04:54.725 --> 1:04:56.967
Makes you less curious,
less, I don't know,

1:04:58.267 --> 1:05:00.168
I guess it keeps ya from
doing stupid stuff, I guess,

1:05:00.203 --> 1:05:04.172
but I kinda forgot who you are.

1:05:05.373 --> 1:05:08.737
Tryin' to be a protective
parent and all that,

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:11.311
I forgot that you
are my daughter.

1:05:12.677 --> 1:05:13.478
You're born to run.

1:05:13.513 --> 1:05:14.380
It's in your blood.

1:05:15.515 --> 1:05:18.186
And I just want
you to know, Holly,

1:05:19.189 --> 1:05:21.090
I'm not standing in
your way any longer.

1:05:22.192 --> 1:05:23.686
You didn't crash and burn today

1:05:23.721 --> 1:05:24.787
because you pushed it too hard.

1:05:24.822 --> 1:05:28.526
You crashed because the
world can't keep up with you.

1:05:29.727 --> 1:05:31.331
And that's the way it should be.

1:05:33.104 --> 1:05:34.499
That's how we make a difference.

1:05:36.074 --> 1:05:39.042
That's what makes
some of us pioneers,

1:05:39.077 --> 1:05:41.407
and some of us just
sticks in the mud.

1:05:46.711 --> 1:05:48.447
- You have no idea how
much it means to me

1:05:48.482 --> 1:05:49.348
to hear you say that.

1:05:51.749 --> 1:05:54.420
- Believe me, I do
because I have fallen

1:05:54.455 --> 1:05:57.192
into that trap of slowing
down way too much myself.

Yeah, back then it was simpler.

1:10:06.443 --> 1:10:07.409
You got that right.

But back then, the sheriff
was on the side of the people.

1:10:12.482 --> 1:10:14.383
Today you just work

grand scheme of things,

1:11:30.692 --> 1:11:33.528
you're worth diddly squat
in the case like this.

1:11:33.563 --> 1:11:36.498
- [Mr. Maxwell] So, when are
you gonna pay me another visit?

1:11:36.533 --> 1:11:38.698
- [Renzo] Nothing in
life comes for free.

1:11:38.733 --> 1:11:41.063
Every favor comes with a debt.

1:11:41.098 --> 1:11:43.835
Every criminal act,
subject to karma.

1:11:45.509 --> 1:11:47.003
- [Holly's Dad] You're born
to run, it's in your blood.

1:11:48.413 --> 1:11:50.743
I'm not standing in
your way any longer.

1:11:50.778 --> 1:11:52.778
- Shelby, get your meds!

1:11:52.813 --> 1:11:55.011
(energetic music)

1:11:55.046 --> 1:11:55.880
Shelby, come on.

1:11:58.621 --> 1:11:59.389
Get in.

1:11:59.424 --> 1:12:00.654
Go.

1:12:00.689 --> 1:12:05.428
Put your seatbelt on.

1:12:05.463 --> 1:12:06.891
Seatbelt on?
- Uh, almost.

1:12:06.926 --> 1:12:07.892
- Put it on.

1:12:07.927 --> 1:12:10.730
(music continues)

1:12:17.574 --> 1:12:20.102
(music continues)

1:12:31.489 --> 1:12:34.556
(Holly's Dad grunts)

1:12:35.493 --> 1:12:37.691
(door slams)

1:12:39.090 --> 1:12:40.463
- You look like
you're in a hurry

1:12:40.498 --> 1:12:42.762
to get somewhere
you don't wanna go.

1:12:42.797 --> 1:12:45.798
- Yeah, we need to
wait for awhile.

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:48.801
- What did you do?

1:12:48.836 --> 1:12:49.736
- The right thing.

1:12:51.069 --> 1:12:54.070
- (sighs) Now you're
paying for it.

1:12:57.779 --> 1:12:59.911
- Dad, I need to know
Mom's gonna be okay.

1:12:59.946 --> 1:13:01.814
- (scoffs) You just
run and leave me

1:13:01.849 --> 1:13:04.113
with a pretty tough job,
don't ya think, Hol?

1:13:05.556 --> 1:13:06.786
Does this mean you and the boy

1:13:06.821 --> 1:13:09.184
are gonna be spending
more time together?

1:13:09.219 --> 1:13:11.692
- Yeah.

1:13:11.727 --> 1:13:13.760
- But you'll be
just fine, Holly.

1:13:15.258 --> 1:13:17.764
- I don't know if I need
to go right or left,

1:13:17.799 --> 1:13:18.963
forwards or backwards,

1:13:18.998 --> 1:13:22.901
but this isn't workin'
for me here, Dad.

1:13:22.936 --> 1:13:25.442
- It's not working for
a lot of people, Holly.

1:13:26.775 --> 1:13:31.778
(sighs) Listen, kiddo,
you gave it your best shot

1:13:33.144 --> 1:13:34.847
and I'm sorry it's all
uphill for your generation.

1:13:34.882 --> 1:13:37.113
But you do whatever
you need to do

1:13:37.148 --> 1:13:39.115
to even out the
playing field, hear me?

1:13:42.857 --> 1:13:46.859
- I guess we'll
(sniffs) keep in touch.

1:13:46.894 --> 1:13:47.728
- Okay.

1:13:49.765 --> 1:13:53.030
You know, I told
myself I came here

1:13:54.869 --> 1:13:57.837
for some spare parts
but I really think
I came here looking,

1:13:57.872 --> 1:13:58.772
I really think I
came you're looking

1:13:58.807 --> 1:14:00.037
for the man I used to be, Hol.

1:14:02.877 --> 1:14:04.547
And I'd rather lose
you for six months

1:14:04.582 --> 1:14:05.779
then have you lose
your edge forever

1:14:05.814 --> 1:14:07.011
because the last thing I want

1:14:07.046 --> 1:14:08.815
is my little girl slowing down.

1:14:12.216 --> 1:14:14.722
- I'm gonna go faster
than you've ever seen.

1:14:16.792 --> 1:14:19.694
- And I'm gonna be
cheering for you.

1:14:19.729 --> 1:14:23.225
(sniffs) For both of you.

1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:25.799
(Holly's Dad sighs)

1:14:25.834 --> 1:14:28.967
(sniffs) You know, Hol,

1:14:30.267 --> 1:14:33.202
ditch the 'burb soon as you can.

1:14:33.237 --> 1:14:34.610
It just don't suit you.

1:14:36.746 --> 1:14:37.547
- Deal.

1:14:37.582 --> 1:14:40.044
(solemn music)

1:14:45.887 --> 1:14:47.821
(engine rumbling)

1:14:47.856 --> 1:14:50.527
(pensive music)

1:14:57.767 --> 1:15:00.801
(music continues)

1:15:14.850 --> 1:15:15.750
- Hey.

1:15:15.785 --> 1:15:16.617
I'm gonna ask you something

1:15:16.653 --> 1:15:17.686
and you have to be
straight with me.

1:15:17.721 --> 1:15:18.280
- Always.

1:15:18.315 --> 1:15:19.919
What?

1:15:19.954 --> 1:15:21.349
- If I can't keep running
meds, what happens?

1:15:21.384 --> 1:15:23.824
- As long as there's
demand, the vacuum fills.

1:15:23.859 --> 1:15:25.694
If not by me than somebody else.

1:15:26.928 --> 1:15:28.763
Do you wanna quit? Is this
because of what I did?

1:15:28.798 --> 1:15:29.995
Because I'm sorry.

1:15:30.030 --> 1:15:31.227
Listen, I know I
crossed the line-

1:15:31.262 --> 1:15:33.064
- No, Renzo, this has
nothing to do with you.

1:15:33.099 --> 1:15:35.803
I kept taking the money and
now the feds are on to me.

1:15:38.203 --> 1:15:40.038
- So, you're leavin'?

1:15:40.073 --> 1:15:42.304
- Yeah, we're headed
straight for the border.

1:15:43.208 --> 1:15:44.614
Do you know if you can-

1:15:44.649 --> 1:15:45.945
- Get you meds in Mexico?

1:15:45.980 --> 1:15:46.946
Yeah.

1:15:46.981 --> 1:15:48.014
Look, I can make
sure Shelby gets

1:15:48.049 --> 1:15:50.851
the best healthcare he's
ever had in his life, okay?

1:15:50.886 --> 1:15:52.149
But there's no way you
get through a checkpoint

1:15:52.184 --> 1:15:53.755
if you're on a wanted list.

1:15:55.055 --> 1:15:55.889
Wait right there.

1:15:58.927 --> 1:15:59.761
- Good, bud?

1:16:03.899 --> 1:16:05.932
No, no, no, Renzo, I can't.
I don't know how to use it.

1:16:05.967 --> 1:16:08.671
- I know, I know, you don't
have to. I'm going with you.

1:16:08.706 --> 1:16:10.970
I can show you a way through
and I can protect you.

1:16:11.005 --> 1:16:13.170
- You don't have to do this
after what I said to you.

1:16:13.205 --> 1:16:15.876
- Truth be told I'd have
done this the day I met you.

1:16:16.945 --> 1:16:17.911
All right? Let's go.

1:16:21.851 --> 1:16:23.719
- Hey, you were right.

1:16:24.722 --> 1:16:26.282
I am the wild horse.

1:16:26.317 --> 1:16:27.855
- I know.

1:16:27.890 --> 1:16:29.351
(door slams)

1:16:29.386 --> 1:16:31.353
(engine rumbling)

1:16:31.388 --> 1:16:32.860
- Seatbelt on?
- Yeah.

1:16:32.895 --> 1:16:35.995
(anticipatory music)

1:16:44.038 --> 1:16:46.874
(music continues)

1:16:53.377 --> 1:16:57.918
(phone ringing)
(music continues)

1:16:57.953 --> 1:16:59.052
- Connolly.

1:16:59.088 --> 1:17:02.659
- You are not going to believe
who I'm tailing right now.

1:17:03.761 --> 1:17:05.354
Renzo Romeo.

1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:12.427
- You're on Renzo
Romeo right now?

1:17:12.462 --> 1:17:14.231
- (sighs) He's on a
nice little road trip

1:17:14.266 --> 1:17:15.463
with almost no protection.

1:17:15.498 --> 1:17:16.937
I mean, do you have
any idea how long

1:17:16.972 --> 1:17:18.070
I've been searching for
this guy and then boom,

1:17:18.105 --> 1:17:19.368
like that, he's in my lap?
- Yeah, okay.

1:17:19.403 --> 1:17:20.842
Hey, keep tabs on him.

1:17:20.877 --> 1:17:21.469
I'm gonna make a phone-

1:17:21.504 --> 1:17:22.712
- Tabs on him?

1:17:22.747 --> 1:17:23.944
No, I've got a team ready to go

1:17:23.979 --> 1:17:26.012
if these guys even think
of heading to Vegas.

1:17:26.047 --> 1:17:27.277
- Jackson, listen to me,

1:17:27.312 --> 1:17:29.048
you are not to lay a
hand on Renzo Romeo

1:17:29.083 --> 1:17:30.313
until I give you the all clear.

1:17:30.348 --> 1:17:32.150
Is that understood? I
have to make a phone call.

1:17:32.185 --> 1:17:33.888
There are politics involved.

1:17:33.923 --> 1:17:36.022
- Oh my God, I am so sick of
hearing about the politics.

1:17:36.057 --> 1:17:37.023
Just let me do my job.

1:17:37.058 --> 1:17:38.959
- And you let me do mine!

1:17:38.994 --> 1:17:41.192
You listen to what
I tell you to do.

1:17:41.227 --> 1:17:43.062
You follow my orders, you grunt!

1:17:50.170 --> 1:17:51.103
- Tommy?

1:17:52.106 --> 1:17:53.204
- [Tommy] Over here.

1:17:53.239 --> 1:17:56.405
(solemn music)

1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:57.274
- Tommy?

1:18:00.213 --> 1:18:01.751
What happened?

1:18:01.786 --> 1:18:04.083
Shelby, please, go
look at the bikes.

1:18:04.118 --> 1:18:05.513
Are you okay?

1:18:05.548 --> 1:18:06.921
Wow.

1:18:06.956 --> 1:18:07.988
- We haven't met yet.

1:18:09.387 --> 1:18:10.188
- Renzo.

1:18:10.223 --> 1:18:11.453
- [Tommy] Renzo.

1:18:11.488 --> 1:18:13.895
- Tommy, we have to get
you to the hospital.

1:18:14.557 --> 1:18:15.897
Who did this?

1:18:15.932 --> 1:18:17.261
- Some heavies.

1:18:17.296 --> 1:18:18.768
Showed up asking about you.

1:18:20.233 --> 1:18:22.035
They said they wanna
send a message.

1:18:23.467 --> 1:18:26.138
Needless to say I might've had
something to say about that.

1:18:28.505 --> 1:18:30.780
- You're the best guard dog
a girl could ever ask for.

1:18:30.815 --> 1:18:32.540
You know that?

1:18:32.575 --> 1:18:34.278
- Those were Maxwell's men.

1:18:34.313 --> 1:18:36.951
Looks like you got two
bounties on your head now.

1:18:38.284 --> 1:18:39.921
- I'm under the impression

1:18:39.956 --> 1:18:41.516
that you might be in a
spot of trouble (coughs).

1:18:43.289 --> 1:18:45.058
- You could say that.

1:18:47.128 --> 1:18:49.964
I think we're gonna lay
low in Mexico for awhile.

1:18:49.999 --> 1:18:51.130
- Oh, yeah?

1:18:51.165 --> 1:18:54.100
I'll have to come visit
once I feel better

1:18:54.135 --> 1:18:56.498
'cause I think you owe me a
truck load of tacos and beans.

1:18:56.533 --> 1:18:58.038
(Holly laughs)

1:18:58.073 --> 1:18:59.072
Ow.

1:18:59.107 --> 1:19:00.139
Yes, please.

1:19:01.076 --> 1:19:03.010
- If they were here
looking for you,

1:19:03.045 --> 1:19:05.848
why did they feel the
need to leave so fast?

1:19:05.883 --> 1:19:09.115
(tires squealing)

1:19:09.150 --> 1:19:10.215
- I have to go.

1:19:11.086 --> 1:19:12.118
- Then go.

1:19:13.319 --> 1:19:16.254
- I love you.

1:19:16.289 --> 1:19:17.992
- I love you.

1:19:18.027 --> 1:19:19.191
- [Holly] Come on.

1:19:19.226 --> 1:19:20.291
- I love you.

1:19:21.492 --> 1:19:23.195
- I'm waiting.

1:19:23.230 --> 1:19:25.362
We literally have
them surrounded.

1:19:25.397 --> 1:19:26.429
- You're good to go.

1:19:27.432 --> 1:19:29.036
Light 'em up if you have to.

1:19:30.138 --> 1:19:31.203
- There's a kid in there.

1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:33.172
- Mm hm.

1:19:35.176 --> 1:19:37.044
How terrible.

1:19:37.079 --> 1:19:39.915
(dramatic music)

1:19:42.051 --> 1:19:44.480
(door bangs)

1:19:56.593 --> 1:20:01.596
(horn honking)
(tires squealing)

1:20:03.633 --> 1:20:05.138
- Night Train, bitch (laughs).

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:07.107
- Secure the area.

1:20:07.142 --> 1:20:08.141
I'm on them.

1:20:08.176 --> 1:20:11.210
(dramatic music)

1:20:17.416 --> 1:20:20.252
(music continues)

1:20:29.230 --> 1:20:30.526
- [Holly] Hang on, Shelby, okay?

1:20:30.561 --> 1:20:31.560
Hang onto something.

1:20:31.595 --> 1:20:34.431
(music continues)

1:20:41.979 --> 1:20:42.912
- Okay.

1:20:42.947 --> 1:20:45.607
Please, tell me that
was intentional, yeah?

1:20:45.642 --> 1:20:48.478
(music continues)

1:20:57.522 --> 1:21:00.325
(music continues)

1:21:04.232 --> 1:21:06.199
(Agent Jackson grunts)

1:21:06.234 --> 1:21:07.662
- Sorry, Officer.

1:21:07.697 --> 1:21:09.136
Foot came off the brake.

1:21:13.142 --> 1:21:13.943
- Thanks, Dad.

1:21:16.343 --> 1:21:21.247
(engine revving)
(energetic music)

1:21:28.421 --> 1:21:31.257
(music continues)

1:21:33.393 --> 1:21:34.491
What the hell is that?

1:21:37.001 --> 1:21:37.560
- It's Maxwell's men.

1:21:37.595 --> 1:21:38.462
Go, go.

1:21:39.696 --> 1:21:41.531
- Shelby, get down on
the floorboard, okay?

1:21:41.566 --> 1:21:43.170
I need you to stay down.

1:21:43.205 --> 1:21:44.468
You gotta stay on the
floorboard, all right?

1:21:44.503 --> 1:21:48.307
(engines revving)
(music continues)

1:21:48.342 --> 1:21:50.210
- He'll kill us out here.

1:21:50.245 --> 1:21:51.079
Come on.

1:21:53.413 --> 1:21:55.182
You okay, kid?

1:21:55.217 --> 1:21:56.414
Stay down.

1:21:56.449 --> 1:22:01.254
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1:22:08.329 --> 1:22:09.195
- Hold on, Shelby.

1:22:09.230 --> 1:22:14.201
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1:22:19.505 --> 1:22:24.508
(revving continues)
(revving continues)

1:22:28.679 --> 1:22:33.682
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1:22:39.756 --> 1:22:44.759
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1:22:48.732 --> 1:22:50.039
I can't outrun that.

1:22:50.074 --> 1:22:51.535
I can't out run it.

1:22:52.439 --> 1:22:53.735
(gun cocks)

1:22:53.770 --> 1:22:55.011
- Keep it steady.

1:22:57.510 --> 1:22:59.345
- Shelby, stay down, okay?

1:22:59.380 --> 1:23:03.745
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:06.352
(shots firing)

1:23:09.126 --> 1:23:11.621
(engine revving)

1:23:14.362 --> 1:23:15.295
You okay?

1:23:15.330 --> 1:23:16.263
Are you okay?

1:23:16.298 --> 1:23:18.364
(pensive music)

1:23:18.399 --> 1:23:23.402
(Holly panting)
(Renzo panting)

1:23:30.279 --> 1:23:32.510
Well, you did say you'd
get us to the border.

1:23:33.711 --> 1:23:35.447
- I'm not stopping
there, all right?

1:23:35.482 --> 1:23:36.481
I'm comin' with you.

1:23:37.649 --> 1:23:40.254
- You wanna hitch
your wagon to this?

1:23:40.289 --> 1:23:41.816
- If you'll let me, yeah.

1:23:44.590 --> 1:23:47.393
- Well, prepare for your life
to get a whole lot wilder.

1:23:48.297 --> 1:23:50.528
- (sniffs) I can handle that.

1:23:52.433 --> 1:23:54.796
(pensive music)

1:23:54.831 --> 1:23:56.237
- Oh, that's bad.

1:23:56.272 --> 1:23:59.108
(music continues)

1:24:07.349 --> 1:24:10.383
(music continues)

1:24:17.392 --> 1:24:20.360
(music continues)

1:24:27.336 --> 1:24:30.436
(music continues)

1:24:45.486 --> 1:24:50.489
- Seems, uh, seems you
underestimated me, huh?

1:24:52.493 --> 1:24:55.890
You see, I've been
staking out this rat hole

1:24:55.925 --> 1:24:59.531
for over a year in
the hopes that maybe,

1:25:00.732 --> 1:25:03.601
maybe one day this
guy would pop up.

1:25:03.636 --> 1:25:06.736
(smirks) Look at you two.

1:25:06.771 --> 1:25:10.212
It's wild how things
come together, ain't it?

1:25:10.247 --> 1:25:11.345
- It is.

1:25:11.380 --> 1:25:12.907
Why don't you keep
that gun on me, huh?

1:25:12.942 --> 1:25:14.612
- Not a problem, Renzo.

1:25:14.647 --> 1:25:19.584
Oh, let's be honest, you're
not much of a threat, are you?

1:25:20.653 --> 1:25:22.224
- Try me.

1:25:22.259 --> 1:25:23.588
- I read every
report we have on you

1:25:23.623 --> 1:25:26.426
and you've never actually
had the guts to kill anyone.

1:25:28.397 --> 1:25:32.366
- And yet here I am, top
of your most wanted list.

1:25:33.864 --> 1:25:35.534
- Yep, here you are.

1:25:35.569 --> 1:25:38.933
You're a smuggler, okay?

1:25:38.968 --> 1:25:41.606
You wanna kill gang
bangers, have at it.

1:25:41.641 --> 1:25:43.641
You'd be doing me a favor.

1:25:43.676 --> 1:25:45.511
You start messing with
the economy, though,

1:25:45.546 --> 1:25:46.479
we got a problem.

1:25:47.348 --> 1:25:48.778
- Listen, I'll come
with you right now

1:25:48.813 --> 1:25:50.846
and they walk, all right?

1:25:50.881 --> 1:25:52.617
- You care about
their safety now?

1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:55.554
Is that right?

1:25:58.592 --> 1:25:59.492
How about this?

1:26:01.463 --> 1:26:02.891
You don't do
contracts, I get it.

1:26:04.862 --> 1:26:07.401
But you and I, we can
still make a deal.

1:26:07.436 --> 1:26:08.864
You testify that this guy forced

1:26:08.899 --> 1:26:10.569
you into this and
I give you my word

1:26:10.604 --> 1:26:13.506
you will be looked after,
new identity, house,

1:26:13.541 --> 1:26:16.245
everything the kid
needs, all taken care of.

1:26:18.579 --> 1:26:19.611
What do ya say?

1:26:24.816 --> 1:26:26.420
- I can do better than that.

1:26:27.753 --> 1:26:28.818
- [Agent Jackson] Oh, yeah?

1:26:30.327 --> 1:26:32.426
- You know, I've been thinking,

1:26:32.461 --> 1:26:35.495
you and I, we're kinda the same.

1:26:37.730 --> 1:26:39.598
You're tired, too, right?

1:26:39.633 --> 1:26:41.468
Because I'm exhausted.

1:26:43.439 --> 1:26:45.373
We're both running
as hard as we can.

1:26:47.344 --> 1:26:49.938
The only difference
is that I'm running

1:26:49.973 --> 1:26:50.872
towards something good,

1:26:52.481 --> 1:26:53.447
and I get the feeling
that you're running

1:26:53.482 --> 1:26:54.481
away from something bad.

1:26:58.850 --> 1:27:01.620
- (sniffles) Wow.

1:27:02.557 --> 1:27:04.623
All right, you got me there.

1:27:06.594 --> 1:27:08.363
- I can give you a bigger fish,

1:27:09.465 --> 1:27:11.696
somebody that's
actually worth chasing.

1:27:12.798 --> 1:27:15.502
And you said it
yourself, I'm a nobody.

1:27:16.703 --> 1:27:19.638
I'm diddly squat in
this case, remember?

1:27:20.839 --> 1:27:22.509
And you mean to tell
me that you signed up

1:27:22.544 --> 1:27:24.005
for this job so
that you could chase

1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:26.007
somebody smuggling
medical supplies?

1:27:27.043 --> 1:27:27.877
- Wow.

1:27:29.485 --> 1:27:32.046
(exhales) That is a hell
of a lot of psychoanalyzing

1:27:32.081 --> 1:27:33.487
you got goin' on there.

1:27:37.889 --> 1:27:38.921
Who are you offering?

1:27:41.794 --> 1:27:42.628
- Stay here.

1:27:48.537 --> 1:27:49.437
Maxwell.

1:27:49.472 --> 1:27:50.306
- Mm.

1:27:51.639 --> 1:27:52.671
Interesting.

1:27:54.477 --> 1:27:56.103
What ya got for me?

1:27:56.138 --> 1:27:57.271
- Are you gonna let us pass?

1:27:57.306 --> 1:28:00.646
- Maybe, it's hard to say
without seeing the goods first.

1:28:01.979 --> 1:28:03.946
- I want something from you.

1:28:03.981 --> 1:28:05.684
- [Agent Jackson] Hm.

1:28:05.719 --> 1:28:07.884
- I wanna know what it is
that you're running from.

1:28:07.919 --> 1:28:12.922
- (laughs) Did this just
become a therapy session?

1:28:13.793 --> 1:28:14.392
Is that what's happening?

1:28:15.630 --> 1:28:17.531
- Do you want Maxwell or not?

1:28:17.566 --> 1:28:19.962
(pensive music)

1:28:31.877 --> 1:28:34.746
- (sighs) I executed
a family in cold blood

1:28:34.781 --> 1:28:36.316
and I'm not proud of it.

1:28:40.182 --> 1:28:42.919
(sniffs) They told
me I had to do it

1:28:42.954 --> 1:28:44.690
because they messed up.

1:28:47.629 --> 1:28:49.057
They had bad intelligence.

1:28:50.764 --> 1:28:53.028
So, an innocent family
had to die at my hands

1:28:53.063 --> 1:28:58.066
and I get to look at them
every time I close my eyes.

1:29:07.649 --> 1:29:10.177
(Agent Jackson sniffs)

1:29:10.212 --> 1:29:11.915
Oh, damn it!

1:29:15.558 --> 1:29:16.392
There ya go.

1:29:17.021 --> 1:29:18.020
You happy now?

1:29:23.632 --> 1:29:26.666
- This is my son, Shelby.

1:29:29.165 --> 1:29:30.406
He's my everything.

1:29:32.168 --> 1:29:34.641
And by laws of science,
he shouldn't exist.

1:29:35.842 --> 1:29:36.643
But here he is.

1:29:38.746 --> 1:29:39.712
Nobody can explain it to me

1:29:39.747 --> 1:29:42.880
but I have my own little theory.

1:29:44.686 --> 1:29:48.655
I think that when something
innocent is killed,

1:29:49.856 --> 1:29:51.757
something pure takes its place.

1:29:53.860 --> 1:29:56.223
And it might help you
to see it that way, too.

1:29:56.258 --> 1:29:58.665
(soft music)

1:30:04.838 --> 1:30:08.004
(Agent Jackson gasps)

1:30:12.681 --> 1:30:14.549
Oh, damn.

1:30:14.584 --> 1:30:16.144
(Agent Jackson exhales)

1:30:16.179 --> 1:30:18.916
This is (sniffs), this is
pretty embarrassing (sniffs).

1:30:21.954 --> 1:30:24.625
(Agent Jackson groans)

1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:25.791
I sure hope whatever you have

1:30:25.826 --> 1:30:27.826
on Mr. Maxwell is worthwhile.

1:30:31.095 --> 1:30:34.569
- I've been going through
people's trash my whole life.

1:30:34.604 --> 1:30:37.770
So, trust me when I say I
know where to find dirt.

1:30:38.806 --> 1:30:41.642
(music continues)

1:30:44.141 --> 1:30:47.780
(Agent Jackson panting)

1:30:49.553 --> 1:30:52.180
(music continues)

1:30:56.593 --> 1:30:57.526
You did good, girl.

1:30:59.827 --> 1:31:00.760
You did damn good.

1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:04.225
Come on, bud.

1:31:09.870 --> 1:31:10.869
Hey.

1:31:13.808 --> 1:31:14.840
Give him hell.

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:17.513
(pensive music)

1:31:25.853 --> 1:31:27.853
(Agent Jackson sniffles)

1:31:27.888 --> 1:31:30.724
(music continues)

1:31:38.833 --> 1:31:40.228
(music continues)

1:31:40.263 --> 1:31:41.636
- [Agent Jackson] Connolly.

1:31:41.671 --> 1:31:44.298
(music continues)

1:31:53.815 --> 1:31:56.651
(music continues)

1:31:58.017 --> 1:32:00.787
(gentle music)

1:32:12.328 --> 1:32:13.899
- So, full disclosure,

1:32:15.067 --> 1:32:17.936
I kinda planned to cross
the border with ya,

1:32:17.971 --> 1:32:18.838
so I called ahead.

1:32:21.810 --> 1:32:22.974
- Now, that's cool.

1:32:27.882 --> 1:32:28.716
- How'd I do?

1:32:29.411 --> 1:32:30.718
- You did good.

1:32:30.753 --> 1:32:31.345
- Yeah?

1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:32.214
- Yeah.

1:32:34.383 --> 1:32:36.218
- Ugh, so not cool.

1:32:36.253 --> 1:32:38.825
(gentle music)

1:32:47.671 --> 1:32:50.298
(music continues)

1:32:52.973 --> 1:32:54.236
- Okay (laughs).

1:32:54.271 --> 1:32:56.843
(doors slamming)

1:32:56.878 --> 1:32:58.240
(Holly sighs)

1:32:58.275 --> 1:33:02.618
I was thinking maybe we could
slow things down a little.

1:33:04.721 --> 1:33:06.886
- Never gonna happen.

1:33:06.921 --> 1:33:07.722
(engine rumbling)

1:33:07.757 --> 1:33:08.921
Ready?

1:33:08.956 --> 1:33:09.790
- Ready.

1:33:11.992 --> 1:33:16.962
(singing in Spanish)
(upbeat Spanish music)

1:33:20.132 --> 1:33:21.329
Oh, yeah.

1:33:21.364 --> 1:33:25.971
(singing in Spanish)
(upbeat Spanish music)

1:33:31.242 --> 1:33:36.245
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:33:41.186 --> 1:33:46.189
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:33:52.065 --> 1:33:57.068
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:34:01.074 --> 1:34:06.077
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:34:11.755 --> 1:34:14.382
(music continues)

1:34:18.762 --> 1:34:23.765
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:34:28.167 --> 1:34:33.170
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:34:37.781 --> 1:34:42.784
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:34:48.154 --> 1:34:53.157
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:34:57.900 --> 1:35:02.903
(singing continues)
(music continues)

1:35:08.207 --> 1:35:11.043
(music continues)
