WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
Tunnel vision. That's our story.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.551
Target wasn't Lara Elliott.

00:09.634 --> 00:13.763
It was her boyfriend who was killed by
another jealous husband, Anton Shavar.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.349
Dangerous man,
the cops never looked into him.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.893
You should look into this one.
Carol Dubois.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.311
The insurance lady.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.273
Alibi or no alibi,
there is something off about her.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.900
<i>The guy you went to see</i>
<i>was your client?</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:29.529
Yeah. Jesús Menendez.
He's doing 15 years for murder.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.448
You asked me what my trigger was.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.617
<i>When he got sentenced, I just shut down.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.077
Pills helped me do it.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.539
Mr. Soto is charged
with human trafficking and slave labor.

00:39.622 --> 00:44.085
I want to get away from him.
I want a new start for my daughter.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.879
That missing money of Jerry's…

00:45.962 --> 00:48.548
What if the money was for a bribe?

00:48.631 --> 00:52.427
How'd you bribe a juror
months before there's even a jury panel?

00:52.510 --> 00:54.179
You planted somebody.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.347
<i>I'm an engineer</i>
<i>at Lockheed Martin.</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.475
I'm single and I live in Palos Verdes.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.351
It's juror number seven, isn't it?

01:00.435 --> 01:03.271
-All I know is he's paid for.
-I thought you had investors.

01:03.354 --> 01:07.442
I had a roommate in college
named Pavel Kosevich. I know.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.070
His father's name is Sergei Kosevich.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.572
This is not a man you fuck with, Mickey.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.742
That's why they're following me.
That's why my car is bugged.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.745
They need
my company's acquisition to go through.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.414
If I get convicted, that doesn't happen.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.626
They'll tie up every loose end
they have to. Do you understand?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.128
That means you, that means your family.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.440
Jesus.

01:48.525 --> 01:52.403
Well, nobody answered the front door.
So figured you were out here.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.866
What can't you tell me over the phone?

01:58.868 --> 02:03.665
I need something.
It has to stay between us. All right?

02:04.415 --> 02:07.919
Get caught, they'll take your
license away and that's just to start.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.879
Who do you need me to kill?

02:11.506 --> 02:12.924
No, I…

02:13.007 --> 02:15.677
No, Cisco, I want you to find out
everything you can

02:15.760 --> 02:17.303
about juror number seven.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.974
Well, that's not just dicey for me.
I mean, jury's anonymous.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.144
If they catch me doing this,
you could get disbarred.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.062
Well, don't let them catch you then.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.356
I'm out of options, Cisco.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.818
An old pile of dog shit
doesn't smell unless you step in it.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.070
And you didn't commit a crime, Mick.

02:34.154 --> 02:40.243
And how the hell could Jerry Vincent bribe
a juror before they even have a jury pool?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.620
I don't know. But he did. And Trevor knew.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.289
Well, then it's privileged.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.085
I mean, even if I find something,
aren't you prohibited from reporting it?

02:49.169 --> 02:52.839
Yes. Unless I know about a crime
that's about to be committed.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.133
Then I have to report it.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.801
The bribe's already been paid.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.053
Not bribery. Jury tampering.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.973
That only occurs
when the jury actually deliberates.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.560
If Jerry had gotten his continuance,

03:06.394 --> 03:09.189
it would be
a completely different jury pool.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.816
Is that why they whacked him?

03:11.900 --> 03:15.945
I'm telling you that's why I need to know
exactly what I'm dealing with.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.365
That's why I need to know
about juror number seven and this guy.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.671
Attorney-client privilege.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.965
Whatever you tell
your lawyer is confidential

03:36.049 --> 03:37.300
but everything has limits.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.053
If you tell me about a crime
you committed, I can't do anything.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.513
But if you tell me about
a crime you're going to commit

03:42.597 --> 03:45.183
and you're using
my services to pull it off,

03:45.266 --> 03:47.393
then I'm required
to do something about it.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.438
Makes sense in theory,
but don't you have a duty to yourself?

03:51.814 --> 03:54.734
What do you do
when reporting it might get you killed?

03:55.860 --> 03:58.947
-<i>This is Haller.</i>
-Had any epiphanies about that bribe?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.783
-Well, I just…
-<i>Haller.</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:03.701
Just…

04:06.913 --> 04:11.668
Listen, um… I think we're just
chasing our tails with this one.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.088
<i>-My investigator dug into it.</i>
-The biker with the beard?

04:15.171 --> 04:19.050
-Maybe Jerry bought a boat after all.
<i>-There's no fucking boat.</i>

04:19.133 --> 04:21.010
You holding something back from me?

04:21.094 --> 04:25.556
It occurred to me, if there is a bribe
in the Elliott case, it might benefit you.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.766
You know what, Griggs?

04:26.849 --> 04:30.728
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that. Gotta go.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.605
-Shit.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.691
Is something going on?

04:57.672 --> 05:00.591
Let's go. First day of trial.
I wanna beat the traffic.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.891
Um…

05:09.642 --> 05:10.852
Car's not starting.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.188
Did you notice anything
wrong with it yesterday?

05:15.982 --> 05:16.858
No.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.610
-No.
-Shit. Damn it.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.156
Let's take your car
and you can pick up the other Lincoln

05:23.239 --> 05:26.242
after you drop me off. All right?
Come on. Let's go.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.130
-What just happened?
-I'll explain later. Come on. Gotta hurry.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.764
Superior Court of the state
of California is now in session.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.392
County of Los Angeles. LA-213497.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.020
The People of California
vs. Trevor Elliott,

05:54.103 --> 05:56.647
the honorable
Judge James P. Stanton presiding.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.649
Please come to order.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.611
Mr. Golantz, opening statement.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.033
Members of the jury, good morning.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.245
I'm Jeffrey Golantz.
I'm a deputy district attorney.

06:12.955 --> 06:17.085
And we're all here today
to serve one objective. Justice.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.589
You're here to serve justice
by answering a simple question.

06:22.215 --> 06:27.095
Did the defendant, Trevor Elliott,
murder his wife and her lover?

06:27.970 --> 06:30.056
I'm here to provide you with that answer.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.517
Which is unequivocally, yes.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.893
Over the next few days,

06:33.976 --> 06:37.980
we'll show Mr. Elliott had both motive
and opportunity to commit this crime

06:38.064 --> 06:41.818
and we will present you with ample
evidence proving that he did so.

06:42.819 --> 06:47.073
We'll listen to the 911 call.
Hear from the deputies on the scene.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.951
Consider the defendant's every action.

06:51.119 --> 06:55.123
And by the end, I am confident that you
will come to the inescapable conclusion,

06:55.206 --> 06:57.375
that Trevor Elliott fired the gun

06:57.458 --> 07:00.586
that killed
both Lara Elliott and Jan Rilz.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.096
Let's start with a little background.

07:11.055 --> 07:14.684
Just who is Trevor Elliott, anyway? Well…

07:14.767 --> 07:16.769
Opening statements are special.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.605
Your chance to bond with the jury
right out of the gate.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.233
But go on for too long, you'll lose them.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.734
Mr. Elliott's company

07:23.818 --> 07:26.737
produced one of the best-selling
video games of all time.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.116
You will learn that he is a man
of unchecked power and wealth,

07:30.199 --> 07:33.744
unwilling to part with what
he considered to be his and only his.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.664
-And you'll also learn…
-That's not my style.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.207
I'm interested in quick jabs.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.794
Land your points,
plant some seeds, raise a few doubts.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.754
But always leave them wanting more.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.550
We will show you
the exact moment Mr. Elliott realized

07:47.633 --> 07:50.136
that his wife and her lover were together.

07:50.219 --> 07:53.764
The anger
and the humiliation that led him to…

07:53.848 --> 07:56.017
The other thing
about openings and closings,

07:56.100 --> 07:58.227
it's the only time
you can use a proving ground.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.147
-The what now?
-The space right in front of the jury box.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.941
The one spot where you can
address the jury face-to-face.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.277
Where the Mickey Haller
charm comes in handy.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.822
If they like me, they like my case.

08:09.906 --> 08:14.076
I'm all out of time here, folks.
But common sense will guide you.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.915
Now the defense will try to
sidetrack you with roadblocks to justice,

08:18.998 --> 08:21.667
but keep your eyes on the prize.

08:21.751 --> 08:26.714
You just remember, two people
had their lives stolen from them.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.592
We're here for them.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.345
Thank you.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.520
Mr. Haller?

08:42.855 --> 08:47.026
Well, Your Honor, that was…
That was quite an address.

08:47.109 --> 08:50.821
I wonder if we shouldn't give the jury
a few minutes to stretch their legs.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.869
-Just make your opening, Mr. Haller.
-Of course, Your Honor.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.915
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
My name is Mickey Haller.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.336
I'm a defense attorney.
This is my client, Trevor Elliott.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.173
I know you've heard some things about him.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.553
But I ask only, please keep an open mind
until you've heard everything.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.516
I'm gonna be brief today because what
I really want is to get to this evidence

09:18.599 --> 09:21.352
Mr. Golantz keeps promising.
For instance, the gun.

09:22.019 --> 09:26.190
Now, I counted six times
he used the word gun in his speech.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.525
Six times he told you

09:27.608 --> 09:32.655
Mr. Elliott used a gun to murder
his wife and an innocent bystander.

09:33.406 --> 09:37.535
What he didn't tell you six times
is the prosecution has no gun

09:37.618 --> 09:40.329
and no way to connect Mr. Elliott to a gun

09:40.413 --> 09:43.666
because Mr. Elliott
has never used or had one.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.794
You see, none of this
matters to the police

09:46.877 --> 09:50.423
because for them it's clear
that once the focus of the investigation

09:50.506 --> 09:55.052
turned to Mr. Elliott, that was it.
They didn't see anything else.

09:55.136 --> 09:59.098
And they never looked into
other potential suspects or evidence.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.600
They didn't care about that.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.768
They had their suspect.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.022
And they never looked back.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
this case is about tunnel vision.

10:10.526 --> 10:16.032
The focus on one suspect and the complete
lack of focus on anything else.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.703
I promise, once you get out of the other
side of the prosecution's tunnel,

10:20.786 --> 10:26.709
you will be squinting at the sunlight,
wondering where their case is.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.630
Thank you very much.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.523
Ah.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.985
-Carol, was it?
-Tell me something.

10:53.694 --> 10:57.323
-How do you sleep at night?
-Excuse me?

10:57.406 --> 11:02.912
You lawyers are all alike.
You use people to get what you need.

11:02.995 --> 11:07.166
Well, I'm going to
be here until the end

11:07.249 --> 11:10.544
to enjoy watching the jury
convict your client.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.796
He's a monster.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.048
He killed my friend.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.926
I'm actually not a lawyer.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.471
I'm just gonna go.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.771
Soto's girlfriend.
You think she'll come through?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.231
Yeah. She's a survivor.

11:30.314 --> 11:33.109
Tanya plays dumb,
but she keeps her eyes open.

11:33.192 --> 11:37.446
She sees everything. I just hope
your ex didn't screw up our deal.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.783
He protected his client.
Which means she's ready to go after Soto.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.451
Good. So am I.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.329
How's my favorite cop?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.539
That's a short list.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.377
Janelle signed off, with help
from the Victim's Compensation Fund.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.548
Relocation and support for an entire year.
You drove a hard bargain.

11:56.298 --> 11:59.927
That's why
you wanted me, right? Where's Hayley?

12:00.010 --> 12:03.639
Where she always is. Don't take it
personally, she speaks teenager now.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.185
Well, thanks for bringing her.
Thanks for bringing yourself, too.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.938
I'm happy to see you back on your feet.

12:11.772 --> 12:15.151
Ah, speaking of Tanya,
I need to see her later.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.613
-I gotta find a ride for Hayley to go to--
-I could take Hayley. If that would help.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.450
Sure, if it's not too much trouble.

12:22.533 --> 12:26.120
It's no trouble. And I, uh…
I kinda wanna get out of here.

12:26.954 --> 12:30.666
Maggie, if you're working late,
Lorna can bring her by my place later.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.212
-It's okay. You're buried, too. So…
-She can do her homework while I prep.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.424
Okay. We'll see how it goes.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.218
Um, thanks, Lorna.
I'll just… I'll tell her.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.806
Now, at this point, Mr. Elliott
had already led you through the house?

12:45.890 --> 12:49.351
Yes, my partner and I
asked him to retrace his steps for us.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.314
Deputy Murray, did you notice anything
unusual about Mr. Elliott's demeanor

12:53.397 --> 12:54.774
as he led you through the house?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.901
Objection. Calls for speculation.

12:56.984 --> 13:00.780
Overruled. It's the officer's
observations. He can speak.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.535
Well, the whole time we were there,
Mr. Elliott showed no emotion at all.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.871
Not when he stepped over
the boyfriend's body.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.956
Nor when he pointed out his wife's body.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.585
When he pointed her out, what did he say?

13:14.668 --> 13:18.380
He just said, "That's my wife.
I'm pretty sure she's dead."

13:18.464 --> 13:21.342
And did the defendant volunteer
any opinion or information

13:21.425 --> 13:22.802
as to who might have done this?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.887
No, only that he didn't do it.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.306
I'm sorry. What was that?

13:29.266 --> 13:33.312
Uh, on three separate occasions,
Mr. Elliott spontaneously stated

13:33.395 --> 13:34.980
that he did not kill anyone.

13:35.731 --> 13:40.236
So, without any emotion, he walks you
through his wife's murder scene,

13:40.319 --> 13:45.282
and then completely unprompted,
he insisted he didn't do it.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.409
Yes, three times.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.038
Thank you, Deputy. Nothing further.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.669
Cross examination?

13:58.671 --> 13:59.588
May I?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.843
Deputy Murray,

14:03.926 --> 14:08.973
now, at the time of this incident,
you were a rookie. Is that correct?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.975
That is correct.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.184
Don't be nervous.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.563
Despite what Mr. Golantz
may have told you, I don't bite.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.941
How long have you been on the force?

14:19.733 --> 14:22.111
Last week
was my one-year anniversary on patrol.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.821
Congratulations.

14:24.864 --> 14:29.535
So, Deputy, at this point in the day,
how long had you been on the scene?

14:29.618 --> 14:31.745
I would say, two minutes.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.582
But my body cam
would corroborate the exact time.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.167
Two minutes
and your partner has his gun drawn.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.545
Did he draw it as soon as you arrived?

14:40.421 --> 14:43.215
I don't recall.
I was focused on the defendant.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.467
Was Mr. Elliott
under arrest at this point?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.553
No, he was not.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.097
Why are you handcuffing him?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.019
He had voluntarily
agreed to be handcuffed.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.980
We had a potentially volatile situation

14:58.063 --> 15:00.900
and I explained it would be best
for his safety and ours

15:00.983 --> 15:03.819
if we could handcuff him
until we secured the premises.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.947
That was
a very well-rehearsed answer.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.199
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.160
Jury will disregard that last remark.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.622
Was Mr. Elliott aware
that he was not under arrest?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.457
Yes. We told him.

15:16.540 --> 15:20.711
Yet his hands
are being cuffed behind, not in front.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.255
We are not allowed to handcuff a sus--

15:24.798 --> 15:26.634
A subject in the front.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.720
A subject. What does that mean?

15:29.803 --> 15:33.265
A subject is anyone
involved in a murder investigation.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.894
-Someone who's arrested?
-Including that, yes.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.772
But again,
Mr. Elliott was not under arrest.

15:41.440 --> 15:47.363
Right. Deputy, at what point
did your partner put his weapon away?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.949
After we searched
and secured the premises.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.702
You mean, after Mr. Elliott walked you
through the entire crime scene?

15:54.787 --> 15:55.788
Correct.

15:55.871 --> 16:00.000
A man is being led through his own house
in handcuffs by two police officers,

16:00.084 --> 16:02.252
one of whom has his gun drawn,

16:02.962 --> 16:06.966
and you're saying it's odd this man would
feel the need to declare his innocence?

16:07.883 --> 16:12.388
-I… I guess it seemed odd, yes.
-You guess?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.307
Deputy, after securing the house,

16:15.391 --> 16:17.601
did you take
the handcuffs off Mr. Elliott?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.562
No. We placed him
in the back of the vehicle.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.899
It's against procedure to place a subject
in the vehicle without handcuffs.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.735
That's that word again. "Subject."

16:26.819 --> 16:28.946
All right, Deputy, so, if he wanted to,

16:29.029 --> 16:32.324
could he have opened the door
and gotten out?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.743
No, the doors have security locks.

16:35.369 --> 16:39.540
Okay, so, he was secured
in the back of a police car

16:39.623 --> 16:41.709
with his hands cuffed behind his back.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.710
That's right.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.004
But he was not under arrest?

16:45.796 --> 16:46.880
No, he was not.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.341
One more thing,

16:49.425 --> 16:51.885
you said when Mr. Elliott
walked you through the house,

16:51.969 --> 16:53.429
he showed no emotion.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.014
That's right.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.266
Are you a trained psychologist, Deputy?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.685
-Objection. Argumentative.
-Sustained.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.687
Rephrase the question.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.232
Deputy, do you believe there's
a correct emotional response to trauma?

17:07.568 --> 17:11.363
I would think that if someone
stumbled upon their wife's body

17:11.447 --> 17:15.409
after she'd been murdered,
they would at least react.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.078
React. How exactly?

17:19.663 --> 17:22.666
-Cry, maybe?
-Is one tear enough?

17:22.750 --> 17:26.170
What if somebody cries for, like,
five minutes and then laughs?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.922
Objection . Argumentative.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.341
Sustained. Counsel, move it along.

17:32.342 --> 17:37.181
Deputy, can you tell us why
you found my client's behavior unusual?

17:37.973 --> 17:41.060
Based on my experience,
I'd never seen anything like it.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.480
Oh. Of course, of course. Your experience.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.441
And on this day,
how long had you been on the job?

17:49.359 --> 17:50.903
Almost seven months.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.614
Were you even
through your probationary period?

17:54.823 --> 17:56.992
No, I was not.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.787
But you're sure he was not under arrest?

17:59.870 --> 18:00.871
I'm sure.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.124
No further questions, Your Honor.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.007
Hey. Excellent job.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.551
We've given our juror
something to work with.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.349
Deputy Murray,
how long prior to your arrival

18:20.432 --> 18:22.810
did the videographer
arrive at the murder scene?

18:23.435 --> 18:24.853
I'm not positive,

18:24.937 --> 18:28.148
but there's at least three minutes
of footage there before we arrived.

18:28.232 --> 18:33.153
Now, when you arrived,
did Mr. Elliott seem worried or panicked?

18:33.904 --> 18:35.823
No, he was very calm.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.117
What was he doing?

18:38.784 --> 18:42.871
I can't say for certain, but it looked
like he was scrolling through his email.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.164
For all he knows,

18:44.248 --> 18:46.667
my client was looking for news
about a killer on the loose.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.212
Sustained. The jury will not consider
that last response as evidence.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.048
Nothing further.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.318
How do you think I'm doing?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.236
Eh.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.364
That advantage you used to have.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.827
The automatic assumption
that cops are honest and trustworthy?

19:22.619 --> 19:23.787
Not so much these days.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.498
Yeah. If you had a different client,
I might agree.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.584
Nobody likes a rich, white douchebag.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.423
I'm glad you weren't
Trevor's lawyer from the start.

19:34.506 --> 19:38.010
You would have been smart enough
not to put that video in discovery.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.247
Have a nice day.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.292
-Your name?
-Tanya Cruz.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.428
I'll be right back.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.788
I thought you were coming alone.

20:47.871 --> 20:51.708
He changed his mind last minute.
Does he know about us?

20:51.792 --> 20:54.336
No, he doesn't. And we'll be quick.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.174
Tanya, my detective
is recording this for clarity

20:59.258 --> 21:00.926
because I can't act as a witness.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.763
We've agreed to the terms of your deal.
So, now it's your turn.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.015
Tell us what you know
about Soto's involvement

21:07.099 --> 21:09.559
in the murder of David Loresca
or any other crimes.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.648
Tanya?

21:15.691 --> 21:20.070
I had a friend
from Cebu City, like myself.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.572
She worked at one of his nursing homes.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.700
About two years ago,

21:24.783 --> 21:28.954
she went to an immigration lawyer
to ask about her rights.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.165
He wanted her to speak to the authorities.

21:32.249 --> 21:36.211
So… she asked
if I thought it was a good idea.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.632
-She asked some other people, too.
-And Soto found out?

21:40.716 --> 21:44.803
I expected him to be furious,
but he just told her not to do it again.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.473
That night I drove him to a flower shop.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.186
I waited in the car
for 30 minutes. I was worried.

21:55.063 --> 22:00.277
Then he came out
with some flowers for me and we went home.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.903
But the next day…

22:04.364 --> 22:09.411
my friend was gone.
He said he put her on a flight home.

22:09.494 --> 22:13.081
No one asked questions,
but I knew she was dead.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.044
I was just too scared to tell anybody.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.213
You're telling me now.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.474
Yes, I have an opening
on Thursday at 11:30.

22:33.852 --> 22:38.315
Tanya, did Soto say or do anything
to confirm he had your friend killed?

22:39.024 --> 22:39.858
I should go now.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.944
Is there a paper trail,
text messages, anything?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.071
No.

22:45.947 --> 22:50.243
But the night
before your witness was killed,

22:50.327 --> 22:52.579
I drove him to the same flower shop.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.917
Where is this place?

23:08.804 --> 23:09.805
You okay in there?

23:10.514 --> 23:14.226
If you're going to interrogate me about
everything that happens to my body,

23:14.309 --> 23:15.352
you can stay home.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.053
Did you get all that?

23:50.679 --> 23:53.348
How much do you wanna bet
Rover never made it to that farm?

23:58.395 --> 24:00.689
Nice. Keep passing.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.649
-Yes. Good.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.530
There we go. You got it.
You got it.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.490
Nice save, Haller.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.287
Hayley! Misha. Break it up.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.291
Hey! Get off me!

24:19.958 --> 24:23.462
Stop it! Stop. Now. Whoa!

24:23.545 --> 24:27.257
Stop. Hayley, go over there.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.926
You, stay right there.

24:30.594 --> 24:36.016
Now, breathe.
Hayley, apologize to… Marsha, is it?

24:36.099 --> 24:37.601
-It's Misha.
-I don't care.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.228
-Sorry.
-Great.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.565
Now, it's your turn.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.692
I'm sorry, too.

24:46.526 --> 24:50.447
Great! Now, go. Play soccer.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.574
I'm sorry. Who are you?

24:54.117 --> 24:56.328
I'm Hayley's ex-stepmother, that's who.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.540
Let's get back to it.
Come on, Hayley. Get it together.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.669
So, Detective Kinder,
could you tell us

25:04.753 --> 25:06.963
about your first interview
with Mr. Elliott?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.341
Yes, that was after we got to the station.

25:09.424 --> 25:12.636
He agreed to be cooperative.
So I began to question him.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.846
Would you say he was forthcoming with you?

25:14.930 --> 25:18.183
He answered all my questions.
But there were some omissions.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.267
Such as?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.061
He first stated that he didn't go

25:21.144 --> 25:23.396
anywhere in the house
aside from his bedroom,

25:23.480 --> 25:26.399
where he found his wife and Mr. Rilz.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.777
We later learned
he first checked the garage

25:28.860 --> 25:31.571
and found his wife's car.
He knew she was there.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.616
And were there other omissions?

25:34.699 --> 25:38.620
Yes. Mr. Elliott had told the deputies
that he called 911

25:38.703 --> 25:41.289
immediately after stumbling
onto the crime scene.

25:41.373 --> 25:46.711
When I factored in the time he left
his office, the timeline seemed off.

25:47.587 --> 25:51.841
So, I confronted him about it
and he admitted to having waited

25:51.925 --> 25:54.761
approximately five minutes
before calling 911.

25:54.844 --> 25:57.931
It's bad enough when a witness
is killing you, but even worse,

25:58.014 --> 26:00.517
when the prosecutor
uses them to run out the clock,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.686
because that witness who's killing you

26:03.353 --> 26:05.522
is the last thing the jury hears that day.

26:05.605 --> 26:09.150
-So, what can you do?
-Change the conversation.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.069
So, Detective Kinder, what, to you,

26:11.152 --> 26:13.572
was the significance
of Mr. Elliott's omissions?

26:13.655 --> 26:15.740
Objection. Calls for speculation.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.325
I'll allow it.

26:18.493 --> 26:21.871
To me, it was indicative
of deception by Mr. Elliott.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.666
I've been doing this
a lot longer than seven months.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.671
Thank you, Detective. Nothing further.

26:29.754 --> 26:33.258
Very well.
The jury will remember their admonition.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.219
-This court is recessed.
-Cross examination, Your Honor?

26:36.303 --> 26:37.804
At 4:27?

26:38.513 --> 26:41.182
It's just that Detective Kinder
is a very busy man.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.853
I have two brief questions.
I would hate to bring him back tomorrow.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.731
-Keep it brief.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.942
Detective Kinder,
at what point in the investigation

26:51.026 --> 26:54.446
did you determine that the primary target
of this double homicide

26:54.529 --> 26:57.032
wasn't Lara Elliott, but Jan Rilz?

26:59.117 --> 27:03.496
At no point did I consider Jan Rilz
to be the primary target.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.707
Wait, so you never questioned Anton Shavar

27:05.790 --> 27:08.501
about his violent encounters
with Jan Rilz?

27:08.585 --> 27:11.338
Or the restraining order
filed against him?

27:11.421 --> 27:14.633
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance. Where is this going?

27:15.342 --> 27:17.302
-Your Honor, may we approach?
-Now.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.767
Now, Your Honor.
Anton Shavar is the husband

27:23.850 --> 27:26.603
of another one of Jan Rilz's
private yoga clients.

27:26.686 --> 27:30.940
Now, there is evidence as to Mr. Shavar's
threatening encounters with Mr. Rilz.

27:31.024 --> 27:34.778
This is an obvious attempt to backdoor in
a third party culpability defense.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.488
He's trying to confuse the jury.

27:36.571 --> 27:40.492
This is an attempt to get to the truth
about who killed these two people.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.703
Now, the witness said
he hadn't even considered the possibility

27:43.787 --> 27:45.830
that Mrs. Elliott wasn't the target.

27:46.581 --> 27:48.083
Just two brief questions?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.795
I only have one follow-up, Judge.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.968
Objection overruled.
The witness may answer the question.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.845
May I ask for a read back, please?

28:02.305 --> 28:06.893
"So, you never questioned Anton Shavar
about his violent encounters with Jan Rilz

28:06.976 --> 28:09.396
or the restraining order
filed against him?"

28:10.563 --> 28:11.398
No.

28:13.149 --> 28:15.735
Did you question any of Rilz's
other private clients

28:15.819 --> 28:18.488
or their husbands,
their boyfriends about the murders?

28:19.489 --> 28:20.407
No.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.450
No further questions.

28:22.534 --> 28:26.204
But we reserve the right
to recall the witness at a later date.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.791
Very well. The witness is excused.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.793
And if there's nothing else…

28:33.336 --> 28:35.547
The jury will remember their admonition.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.048
This court is now recessed.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.408
Your father is worried sick about you.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.994
-Ever since--
-Yeah, I know.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.164
Their concern is annoying at this point.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.166
Well, they're your parents, Hayley.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.918
It's none of my business,
but don't they have a point?

29:14.002 --> 29:16.129
What happened today is nothing like you.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.506
That fight was not about my parents.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.717
Not about how I feel about them, anyway.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.968
Then what was it about?

29:23.845 --> 29:26.014
-Trevor Elliott.
-What?

29:27.223 --> 29:31.102
The girls at school think that because
my dad is representing a monster,

29:31.186 --> 29:34.481
he must be a monster.
And, you know, I try to just shut it out.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.024
But today, Misha said, quote,

29:36.107 --> 29:38.902
"Your dad is single-handedly
upholding the patriarchy

29:38.985 --> 29:42.405
and enabling abuse."
So, I took a swing at her.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.364
Hayley!

29:46.201 --> 29:48.787
You're lucky he doesn't
have to represent you after that.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.291
Yeah, I know. I just… There's no
discussion with the woke police.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.585
My dad is not a bad person.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.545
But it's hard
when he represents bad people.

29:59.005 --> 30:02.383
Look, here's the thing, who's to say
who the bad people are. Right?

30:02.467 --> 30:05.428
They're still people.
That's what the whole system is about.

30:05.512 --> 30:09.015
Everyone in that courtroom
is an entire world to someone else.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.975
Your mom's witness, he had a family,

30:11.059 --> 30:13.895
and your mom won't rest
until she catches who killed him.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.857
-Makes her a hero in my book.
-You think my mom is a hero?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.985
-Yes, I do. And so does your father.
-Yeah.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.195
And on the other side,

30:22.278 --> 30:26.533
everyone your father represents
is a person, too. Even Trevor Elliott.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.245
Your friends just see a rich guy
charged with killing his wife. I get it.

30:31.204 --> 30:35.041
But it's just day one of the trial,
and they've already judged him guilty.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.293
Yeah, and I wouldn't say
they're my friends.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.215
People are wrongly accused
and overcharged all the time.

30:42.298 --> 30:46.511
And your dad just wants
to make sure that one innocent person

30:46.594 --> 30:48.721
doesn't get thrown out with the bathwater.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.808
Even if he has to wade through
1,000 guilty people to find them.

30:52.725 --> 30:56.145
So he's a hero, too.
No matter what that dumbass, Misha, says.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.191
-So, why aren't you a lawyer?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.694
You make more sense
than both of my parents.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.321
I mean, come on.

32:00.209 --> 32:04.130
Hey, babe. Kind of in the middle
of something right now.

32:04.213 --> 32:07.383
I'm gonna do it.
I'm going back to law school.

32:07.467 --> 32:11.512
-That's fantastic.
-People out there are in need, Cisco.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.474
-I think I can help them.
-Absolutely.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.560
You, uh, gonna level with Mickey about it?

32:18.978 --> 32:19.812
Yeah.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.858
Well, if you need
a good investigator, I know a guy.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.820
-What're you doing in there?
-Gotta go.

32:27.904 --> 32:31.032
-I'm calling the cops.
-No, there's no need for that.

32:31.115 --> 32:34.994
My girlfriend and I had a fight
and she threw out my, uh…

32:35.912 --> 32:37.413
childhood bong.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.207
-What?
-You know, the…

32:41.209 --> 32:42.710
Have you seen it?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.879
Just get out of here. Now.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.511
Tags on both sides,
shop is clean.

32:51.594 --> 32:52.553
What does it tell you?

32:52.637 --> 32:55.098
-They're paying taxes to the gang.
-Yeah?

32:55.181 --> 32:56.307
Or they're part of it.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.979
You know, I gotta ask.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.356
The scumbags we put away,

33:04.774 --> 33:07.610
what the hell did you ever
talk about over dinner

33:07.694 --> 33:09.570
with a guy who defends them?

33:09.654 --> 33:11.364
It's not as simple as that.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.617
That said, there are reasons he's my ex.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.079
What about you? Why'd you call it quits?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.415
Shit. I don't know.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.626
Every night was like,

33:23.710 --> 33:27.672
"Do I sit in traffic for 80 minutes
to hear about my wife's students?"

33:27.755 --> 33:30.675
And then, I try to tell her about my day?

33:31.300 --> 33:34.679
And it's like she's speaking French.
I'm speaking Estonian.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.806
-This freaking job.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.393
Other people
have no idea what it does to you.

33:42.979 --> 33:47.567
Speaking of your ex,
I got a visit from Ray Griggs about him.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.944
-Detective Griggs? What about?
-I'm not sure.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.114
He must've looked into him.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.117
He knew I was up against him once.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.286
Trust me,
I'm not trying to do Haller any favors,

33:58.369 --> 34:01.539
but out of respect for you,
I figured I'd say somethin'.

34:01.622 --> 34:05.168
-Should Mickey be worried?
-No. Not if he hasn't done anything.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.504
Griggs is like a dog with a bone.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.382
And if there's something there,
that guy will dig it up.

34:14.135 --> 34:18.222
All right. I'll get the gang unit
ID these tags in the morning.

34:18.306 --> 34:22.685
It's BNG. I put two of 'em away
for homicide last year.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.604
I don't know
the rest of the players, though.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.774
Oh. Look at you.

34:29.358 --> 34:32.070
I got some friends
at Hollywood Division. They'll know.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.957
So, are you going to ask?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.336
Yeah, we'll talk about your fight.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.756
Not when I have to prepare for tomorrow.

34:59.180 --> 35:03.101
I wish you wouldn't take out your feelings
about my career on another girl.

35:03.184 --> 35:07.396
Contrary to what you believe,
not everything I do is because of you.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.150
-Yeah?
-Hey, Mick!

35:11.234 --> 35:12.068
It's open.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.456
-Hey. How you doin', Hayley?
-I hear you're marrying Lorna.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.458
What does that make us?

35:27.542 --> 35:30.670
Well, I'm the dad you call
when you need someone's legs broken.

35:30.753 --> 35:33.131
-All right. Hold that thought.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.760
Just so you know.

35:41.097 --> 35:45.226
Juror number seven's real name
is Glenn McSweeney.

35:45.309 --> 35:50.231
He lives in Van Nuys, definitely doesn't
work at Lockheed and he has a record.

35:50.314 --> 35:55.069
-I thought you lost your source in LAPD.
-You think that's gonna stop me?

35:56.070 --> 35:57.947
So, what about the other thing?

36:00.032 --> 36:03.452
This guy, Kosevich.
Officially, he made his money

36:03.536 --> 36:06.205
as one of Russia's first private bankers.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.958
Unofficially, he's got
his fingers in everything.

36:09.041 --> 36:13.296
Ties to Putin,
GRU, Russian mob, you name it,

36:13.379 --> 36:17.341
he's been accused of it,
including disappearing people.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.469
And it just so happens that his son

36:20.553 --> 36:23.556
was one of Trevor Elliott's
college roommates.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.391
I'm figuring you already knew that.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.979
-So what's the play?
-I don't know yet.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.481
The less you know, the better.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.568
I knew guys in the Road Saints,

36:36.235 --> 36:39.363
got to the point
where they couldn't get out of bed

36:40.198 --> 36:43.367
'cause they were afraid of
what they'd be asked to do that day.

36:44.619 --> 36:48.372
That you either
live that life or you don't.

36:48.456 --> 36:49.290
This guy?

36:50.333 --> 36:52.293
He lives that life. No problem.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.714
He went through
a shitload of trouble to fix a jury.

36:56.797 --> 37:00.676
So, you come along
and fuck his plan up, get a mistrial,

37:01.510 --> 37:04.889
you don't know
what he's gonna do to you or your family.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.558
I'm just saying.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.736
-Maggie?
-Hey.

37:18.819 --> 37:22.323
This is Detective Kyle Winters,
Detective Linda Perez.

37:22.406 --> 37:26.244
Either of you get a chance to work
with McFierce here, you won't regret it.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.412
I went up against your ex once.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.665
-Murder case.
-One I told you about.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.917
I'm sure you could both tell stories but…

37:33.000 --> 37:36.671
Of course. I brought Linda because
she used to work vice in Hollywood.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.881
-She knows all the players.
-You got anything?

37:38.965 --> 37:40.967
A name popped up, I think fits the bill.

37:41.050 --> 37:45.596
Alvin Aquino.
BNG ink, on parole for attempted murder.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.640
-Guess where he works?
-Namayan Flowers.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.393
I checked with Aquino's
parole officer. He'll play ball.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.728
-Thanks for this.
-Good luck.

38:27.221 --> 38:31.183
-How do you like your steak?
-Medium, but I'm fine, thanks.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.101
Medium?

38:33.644 --> 38:35.980
I figured. It's practical.

38:36.772 --> 38:38.107
Like a Lincoln.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.860
You gotta try some of this
black and blue though.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.487
1,800 degrees for one minute on each side.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.282
Outside it's a leather jacket,
but inside--

38:46.365 --> 38:49.452
Spare me the cooking lessons, Teddy.
You gonna help me or what?

38:49.535 --> 38:53.539
I like you, Counselor.
But I'm just gonna come out and say it.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.626
You already owe me. For Cisco.

38:58.294 --> 39:02.715
People who owe me too many times
tend to end up regretting it.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.677
But sure. Happy to help.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.596
-Thanks.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.389
It's time.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.734
All right.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.574
We're waiting for something?

39:30.284 --> 39:31.869
I know what this place is.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.581
What, you think I came here to buy drugs?

39:35.664 --> 39:38.167
It takes a schemer to know one,
you're scheming.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.503
That's not why we're here, Izzy.
All right?

39:40.586 --> 39:43.130
What was up with the car yesterday?
That whole gimmick?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.257
-You really wanna know?
-Yes.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.885
Somebody bugged my car.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.471
-Not this one. The other one.
-What?

39:50.554 --> 39:52.014
Well, you wanted to know.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.809
-What about this car?
-No, it's clean.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.477
Cisco sweeps it every day.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.647
-What if my car is bugged?
-It's not.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.108
Does Cisco sweep my car too?

40:04.193 --> 40:05.778
You let him break into my car?

40:05.861 --> 40:08.030
It's not really breaking in.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.282
What do you call it? Wait, hold on.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.993
-Who bugged your car?
-That's attorney-client privilege.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.830
Technically, you work for me, but…
Can we just…

40:15.913 --> 40:19.041
We're, like, an hour from downtown.
Can I explain on the road?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.126
Mmm-hmm.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.168
Thank you.

40:47.653 --> 40:51.449
I think Stanton's considering
my request for a directed verdict.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.493
-I'm sure.
-Should I be worried?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.503
Judge Stanton wants to see both
counsel in chambers immediately.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.338
Alone.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.186
Counsel, I'm gonna
ask you a few questions.

41:20.936 --> 41:23.814
First, I'd like to remind you both
of your duty of candor

41:23.898 --> 41:26.108
and your ethical responsibilities
to this court.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.776
-Absolutely.
-Of course.

41:28.611 --> 41:31.780
It's come to my attention that this court
has been the victim of jury tampering.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.574
-Jury tampering?
-Mr. Haller?

41:33.657 --> 41:36.243
Given what I've just said,
do you have anything you wish to add?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.078
Me? Why aren't you asking him?

41:42.666 --> 41:45.211
I received this last night via courier.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.839
"Judge Stanton, you should know that juror
number seven is not who you think he is

41:48.923 --> 41:50.257
and not who he says he is."

41:50.341 --> 41:52.092
"Check Lockheed, and check his prints."

41:52.176 --> 41:53.636
"He's got an arrest record."

41:54.678 --> 41:56.388
No indication as to who it's from.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.850
Okay. I'm sorry, Judge.
What's goin' on here?

42:00.601 --> 42:03.938
Juror number seven is supposed to be
a man named Rodney Bankland.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.941
But detectives
spoke with him this morning.

42:07.024 --> 42:09.068
Mr. Bankland never received a jury summons

42:09.151 --> 42:11.362
and he is not the man
who's been sitting on our jury.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.364
That man, it would appear, is an imposter.

42:13.447 --> 42:15.157
Did we get him when he came in?

42:15.241 --> 42:18.327
Oh, the plot thickens. Juror number seven
didn't show up this morning.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.745
Someone tipped him off.

42:19.828 --> 42:23.582
I can't imagine a scenario where jury
tampering would favor the prosecution,

42:23.666 --> 42:25.834
given the circumstances
of your predecessor.

42:25.918 --> 42:29.129
I'm insulted that you would think
I had anything to do with this.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.257
I would support any investigation.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.424
Very well.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.593
The circumstances warrant a mistrial,

42:34.677 --> 42:37.846
and after conferring with some colleagues,
I'm inclined to declare one.

42:37.930 --> 42:40.057
-My guess is that was the goal.
-Seriously?

42:40.140 --> 42:43.143
I will prove you wrong.
Your Honor, is that necessary?

42:43.227 --> 42:45.771
The integrity of this trial
has been compromised.

42:45.854 --> 42:48.107
If the jury had deliberated, I'd agree.

42:48.190 --> 42:51.068
But they haven't.
We can fill the slot with an alternate.

42:51.151 --> 42:54.822
To do anything else, it would further
damage my client in the public eye.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.784
Do the People have an opinion?

42:59.493 --> 43:02.538
I don't know anything about this,
but I'm confident I can win the case,

43:02.621 --> 43:04.039
no matter who's on the jury.

43:10.921 --> 43:14.466
Then I'll spend the day making sure
the other jurors are, in fact,

43:14.550 --> 43:17.303
who they're supposed to be,
and remain unaffected.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.848
We'll pick up trial tomorrow.
Good day, gentlemen.

43:25.311 --> 43:28.772
-What do you mean our guy didn't show?
-He must've been tipped off.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.317
The judge knows
and the sheriffs are all over it.

43:32.359 --> 43:34.945
-You did this, didn't you?
-Trevor, back off.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.489
-Do you wanna make a scene here?

43:42.661 --> 43:45.164
I had nothing to do with this, all right?

43:45.247 --> 43:48.500
Maybe it was your Russian friends
cutting bait. Maybe they fucked up.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.754
It doesn't matter, Mickey, because
these guys are not the type of people

43:51.837 --> 43:53.797
who own up to their fucking mistakes.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.799
Maybe juror number seven's dead.

43:55.883 --> 43:59.303
Did you think of that?
Maybe you and I are next.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.387
As long as we win,

44:00.471 --> 44:02.431
-you have nothing to worry about.
-That's…

44:02.514 --> 44:06.935
-Great. That's great.
-You never thought we could win this.

44:07.019 --> 44:10.105
Without our juror? Are you kidding?
I know how this looks.

44:10.189 --> 44:16.153
Trevor, we can win this. We can win
and we will. Fair and square. All right?

44:20.949 --> 44:23.827
There's one more exception
to attorney-client privilege.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.580
If my client's about to commit a crime,
I have to report it.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.166
Unless I can stop that crime
from happening.

44:29.249 --> 44:33.045
Then, it's no harm, no foul.
Nobody ever has to know.

44:33.128 --> 44:36.048
But how do you do that
without it blowing up in your face?

44:39.718 --> 44:41.720
<i>I'll meet</i>
<i>Hayley's counselor tomorrow.</i>

44:41.804 --> 44:43.639
Yeah, I wish I could be there, Mags.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.766
<i>There'll be plenty</i>
<i>for you after this trial.</i>

44:46.475 --> 44:48.519
By the way, anything new on Jerry's case?

44:48.602 --> 44:50.604
No, I don't know. Griggs is handling that.

44:50.688 --> 44:51.522
Yeah.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.484
-You talk to him lately?
-No, not really. Why?

44:55.567 --> 44:59.446
I don't know, I just… I remember he was
giving you some problems before, so…

44:59.530 --> 45:02.950
Mags, if there was a problem,
I'd handle it. All right?

45:03.033 --> 45:05.869
<i>I know. It's just, there's the normal way</i>
<i>to handle things,</i>

45:05.953 --> 45:07.246
<i>and there's the Mickey way.</i>

45:09.039 --> 45:11.291
-Have a good night, Mags.
-Good night.
