03:07.105 --> 03:08.106
<i>Front door!</i>

03:08.189 --> 03:09.524
I can't let it in
unless I see it.

03:09.607 --> 03:12.235
I know what the rules are. I'm just
asking if you can make an exception.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.279
There are no exceptions.
That's why we have rules.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.489
I know what a rule is.
I'm just telling you...

03:16.573 --> 03:17.824
You don't have an X-ray
machine back there?

03:17.907 --> 03:19.701
You don't have
an X-ray machine?

03:19.784 --> 03:20.952
No. I've got to see it.

03:41.973 --> 03:44.392
<i>I bet you're not
going to miss that drive.</i>

03:46.144 --> 03:47.854
Or the ambiance.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.065
I would've gone a lot further.

03:57.155 --> 04:01.492
You know, they gave me a
brochure on reintegrating.

04:01.576 --> 04:02.744
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.829
A social worker came by.

04:05.330 --> 04:07.123
What did he say?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.335
Go slow.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.255
We can go slow.

04:28.061 --> 04:29.646
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:30.188 --> 04:34.233
I just wanted to remind you that
I won't be coming in tomorrow.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.070
That's right.
It's the big day!

04:37.195 --> 04:39.405
You must be thrilled...

04:39.489 --> 04:40.573
Yeah.

04:40.657 --> 04:43.076
...and excited
and nervous and...

04:43.785 --> 04:46.454
And I wanted to thank you,
just for everything.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.122
You've been so understanding.

04:48.206 --> 04:51.876
Oh, I'm sure there's more to it
than what's on the news, so...

04:51.960 --> 04:55.797
I know, but to a lot of people
you say "insider trading,"

04:55.880 --> 05:00.134
and it may as well be murder.
You just stop existing.

05:00.218 --> 05:02.345
So, thank you for everything.

05:06.391 --> 05:08.893
I wasn't sure
what I should wear.

05:10.311 --> 05:13.106
I tried to find
something new to buy,

05:14.065 --> 05:16.317
but I couldn't find
anything that looked good.

05:16.401 --> 05:18.569
Honey, you look beautiful.

05:18.987 --> 05:22.407
And I can only imagine how
you're gonna look to him.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.092
Oh!
Oh, Mama.

05:42.593 --> 05:43.678
Oh.

05:44.220 --> 05:48.016
Come on. Let's get out of here
before they change their mind.

06:10.788 --> 06:13.124
I'm sorry.

06:22.091 --> 06:25.136
<i>Babe, you remember that
hedge fund manager I met inside?</i>

06:25.595 --> 06:27.430
Marshall Hellman?

06:28.431 --> 06:30.433
The Stanford guy?
Yeah.

06:30.767 --> 06:35.271
Super smart. He was in for some
tax thing, but he'll be out soon.

06:36.314 --> 06:39.942
He's got money in Dubai
and a lot of connections.

06:41.986 --> 06:44.072
I can get us back
to where we were, Em.

06:44.155 --> 06:46.616
I promise. I can
make that happen.

06:48.785 --> 06:50.286
Okay, baby.

07:06.844 --> 07:07.845
Thank you.

08:04.861 --> 08:06.821
I don't understand
what you're saying! Just relax!

08:06.863 --> 08:08.447
Hello.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.991
I'm Dr. Banks.

08:10.074 --> 08:13.286
This guy's on something, okay?
Listen, just relax!

08:13.369 --> 08:14.996
Officer.
This guy's on something.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.956
He came swinging at me.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.124
Stand back and
let me talk to him.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.293
He was trying
to hold up a taxi.

08:20.376 --> 08:21.669
You understand?
He came at me!

08:35.390 --> 08:37.602
Augustin? Augustin.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.565
He's fine.

09:08.216 --> 09:09.884
What is it?
What's going on?

09:09.967 --> 09:12.720
He saw his dead
father driving the taxi.

09:13.471 --> 09:14.472
What?

09:14.555 --> 09:17.808
He saw the ghost of his father.
He was a cabbie.

09:18.309 --> 09:19.727
So I was right.
He's nuts.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.729
No. It's grief.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.566
Just grief painting
pictures in his brain.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.318
He sees ghosts.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.075
He's Haitian. It's not
unusual for Haitians

09:34.158 --> 09:35.576
to see their loved ones
shortly after they die.

09:35.660 --> 09:38.663
Weird for me and you, but it's
perfectly normal for him.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.248
Right, what do you have next?

09:40.331 --> 09:44.585
MVA in bed eight, with minor head
trauma, in need of a consult.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.799
Double shift today?

09:49.882 --> 09:51.384
Better living
through chemistry.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.556
Miss Taylor.

09:57.682 --> 09:59.392
Yeah?
I'm Dr. Banks.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.520
Oh, they said I might
have a concussion,

10:02.603 --> 10:04.404
but I don't have to stay
here for that, right?

10:04.480 --> 10:07.400
Uh, we have to wait for the
CT scan results to know that.

10:07.483 --> 10:09.902
I have a couple of
questions for you.

10:10.695 --> 10:11.696
How's your head?

10:12.363 --> 10:13.614
It hurts.

10:13.698 --> 10:15.908
How was it before
you hit the wall?

10:17.034 --> 10:18.619
What do you mean?

10:18.703 --> 10:20.579
How have things
been going with you?

10:20.830 --> 10:22.540
Generally speaking.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.421
Why are you here?

10:29.255 --> 10:31.340
I'm a psychiatrist,
Miss Taylor.

10:31.841 --> 10:33.175
Normally,

10:34.385 --> 10:35.720
when people hit things
with their car,

10:35.803 --> 10:39.265
there are skid marks
on the pavement.

10:39.348 --> 10:43.144
A brick Wall's a pretty good
reason to use the brakes,

10:43.227 --> 10:44.353
turn the wheel.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.523
You didn't do that.
You went straight in.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.443
It says here the attendant
told the police

10:50.526 --> 10:53.821
you were pretty upset
before you got in the car.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.033
Now, the insurance company
are gonna check the brakes,

10:57.116 --> 10:59.076
but I prefer to just ask you.

11:01.412 --> 11:04.040
Did you try to hurt
yourself this morning?

11:17.386 --> 11:20.306
Do you still want to
try and hurt yourself?

11:21.098 --> 11:22.266
Emily.

11:25.728 --> 11:29.398
How do you feel about staying
here for a few days?

11:31.275 --> 11:32.443
Here?
Mmm.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.404
No, I can't stay here.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.283
Martin just got home and I
have to be there for him.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.868
Is that your husband, Martin?

11:40.951 --> 11:43.496
Yes, and he just
got out of prison.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.332
I have to be there, and I have a job.
I have to go into work.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.876
He doesn't make any money yet.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.171
Are you married?

11:52.755 --> 11:53.881
Yes.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.244
Okay, what if you
got out of jail

11:55.299 --> 11:57.635
or you were away for a long
time and you come home

11:57.718 --> 12:00.596
and your wife is in
the mental hospital?

12:01.180 --> 12:04.683
We waited for four years.
I can't stay here.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.562
I think you may have tried to hurt
yourself this morning, and...

12:08.646 --> 12:11.482
It was a mistake.
I lost it for a minute.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.777
I promise, that's not
going to happen again.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.114
Do you have an office?
Mmm.

12:18.197 --> 12:21.033
Well, I could come
see you at your office.

12:21.117 --> 12:22.438
I could come as
often as you want.

12:22.451 --> 12:25.079
I could come two
or three times a week.

12:25.496 --> 12:26.914
I was in therapy once before,

12:26.997 --> 12:30.835
and I remember that structure
really helps with hopelessness.

12:32.128 --> 12:34.922
I promise. I just
really want to go home.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.008
Okay. So we'll
release her to you,

12:38.092 --> 12:42.221
um, but I want to see her in my office this week.
That's the deal we made.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.723
I just had no idea this
was still going on.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.101
Oh, honey, I think she must have
been putting on a brave face.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.645
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid to tell me.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.772
I want to start her on this.
It's called an SSRI.

12:51.856 --> 12:55.192
It affects the neurotransmitter
in the brain called serotonin.

12:55.276 --> 12:57.111
<i>What does that do exactly?</i>

12:57.194 --> 13:01.157
<i>Basically, it helps stop the
brain from telling you you're sad.</i>

13:01.740 --> 13:04.952
<i>In a few weeks, she should
start to feel better.</i>

13:06.495 --> 13:08.914
No, of course.
Of course.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.378
It was soft. Absolutely,
it was soft in that first...

13:15.212 --> 13:17.590
But we are going
to tighten it up.

13:18.007 --> 13:20.050
Sure, that's what we do.

13:21.010 --> 13:25.222
Yeah. I think it'll be interesting
to regroup after the Dallas groups.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.559
Emily?

13:29.518 --> 13:30.769
Are you okay?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.538
Emily?

13:55.920 --> 13:57.129
Aww!

13:58.714 --> 14:00.382
What happened?

14:02.510 --> 14:03.719
Oh!

14:04.386 --> 14:06.722
These made me sick, too.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.226
I had better luck with Celexa.

14:17.066 --> 14:20.402
<i>I used to draw when I was a kid.
Mostly people, though.</i>

14:21.904 --> 14:24.615
Teachers and kids
from my class.

14:25.324 --> 14:27.117
Boys that I liked.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.994
Sometimes cats.

14:32.081 --> 14:34.792
I used to try and get
their faces perfect.

14:36.585 --> 14:40.297
That's why I came to New York, I
wanted to get into graphic design.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.008
I was taking classes
when I met Martin.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.510
How did that happen?

14:46.804 --> 14:51.225
I was working at this, uh, bar
downtown to help pay for school,

14:51.308 --> 14:54.311
and he kept coming in
after work.

14:54.562 --> 14:57.690
And he would just order the
most complicated drinks.

14:57.815 --> 15:00.359
Things that I had
no idea how to make.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.655
One night, he climbed
over the bar

15:04.738 --> 15:07.408
and offered to teach
me how to make them.

15:07.491 --> 15:11.996
And he ended up staying until we closed.
Then he asked me out.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.956
And you went.

15:15.666 --> 15:19.336
I didn't know who he was or what he did.
He was just...

15:20.504 --> 15:22.840
He was just this guy in a suit.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.594
And watched me
while I made drinks,

15:26.677 --> 15:29.638
and that made me
really nervous.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.017
Then he stared at me
like I was a painting.

15:34.518 --> 15:38.355
He had this beautiful sailboat,
and he took me out on it.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.524
Taught me how to ski.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.527
He swept me off my feet.

15:44.361 --> 15:49.033
Proposed to me in Maui that winter
and we were married by spring.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.412
How old were you?

15:54.371 --> 15:59.793
That was five years ago,
so I was 23.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.717
Time goes by so fast.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.222
Is this ever going to go away?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.976
You said you felt
depressed before.

16:16.185 --> 16:18.354
Did you see anyone
about it last time?

16:18.437 --> 16:22.274
Yeah. In Greenwich, Connecticut.
Victoria Siebert.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.402
I had to stop seeing her when
they took our house away

16:25.486 --> 16:28.197
and I had to move
back to the city.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.158
Do you mind if I contact
Dr. Siebert about your history?

16:31.241 --> 16:32.826
No, of course not.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.912
<i>- I saw her four years ago.</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:37.331
For a little over nine months.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.083
She didn't just have the
rug pulled from under her,

16:39.166 --> 16:42.378
she had the rug,
the home, the husband.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.588
Her entire life, gone.

16:45.756 --> 16:50.761
Even her health insurance. She
moved into the city to find work

16:50.969 --> 16:53.639
and I never heard
from her again.

16:53.931 --> 16:57.601
I'm glad she's seeing a man this time.
I think that will help.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.645
Why is that?

16:59.853 --> 17:02.356
Never felt seen by her father.

17:02.773 --> 17:06.276
Then her husband ends up in
jail and she's abandoned again.

17:07.111 --> 17:10.823
I'd be happy to see her have a
different kind of experience.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.076
She says you tried
her on medication.

17:14.159 --> 17:18.997
Oh, yes. Wellbutrin.
Prozac. Effexor.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.625
Really struggled.
Mmm.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.587
I remember she had problems with
sleep and nausea. Chills...

17:25.671 --> 17:28.214
I'm putting her on Zoloft, see
if she can tolerate that.

17:29.133 --> 17:31.593
Oh. Well, maybe she's a candidate
for one of these newer meds.

17:31.677 --> 17:34.138
Sometimes the newest thing
gives them confidence.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.350
They see the ads
on TV, they believe.

17:38.809 --> 17:41.562
I have a patient with
some similar issues.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.522
I put her on Ablixa.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.566
Welcome, everyone!
Thank you for coming.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.359
We'll be starting
the presentations soon,

17:47.443 --> 17:49.486
so if everyone can come
in and take a seat.

17:51.989 --> 17:55.993
You know, I may have some samples here.
Let me see.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.539
No. I must have
given them all away.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.584
Here! Have an Ablixa pen.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.712
Had it been
available back then,

18:06.795 --> 18:10.090
I would have prescribed it for
Emily after she miscarried.

18:10.174 --> 18:11.300
Miscarried?
Hmm.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.343
After he went to jail.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.512
She, uh, hasn't mentioned that.

18:15.596 --> 18:16.889
No?
No.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.265
Has he been released yet?

18:18.348 --> 18:19.933
A week ago.
Oh!

18:20.017 --> 18:21.818
Well, maybe that will
help turn things around.

18:21.894 --> 18:22.895
Hmm.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.982
Look, don't mention
anything to Carl or Kayla

18:27.065 --> 18:29.735
about Hellman. It'll
just make things easier.

18:33.322 --> 18:36.575
I still think Carl's the
one who went to the Feds.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.203
He probably gave
us these tickets

18:39.286 --> 18:42.164
because he feels shitty
about everything.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.294
I hope these things work.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.087
Hey.

18:51.590 --> 18:55.969
Look, if you don't feel up
to this, I can go by myself.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.640
I understand if you don't
want to see those people.

18:59.723 --> 19:00.933
<i>All right?</i>

19:01.016 --> 19:03.310
<i>But I got to get back out
there at some point.</i>

19:03.393 --> 19:06.522
<i>If I just sit here by
myself, I'm just gonna feel worse.</i>

19:06.605 --> 19:10.192
<i>I have to at least try.
Dr. Banks would want me to try.</i>

19:23.705 --> 19:24.748
Carl?

19:25.415 --> 19:26.750
Martin! Welcome back.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.210
How are you, sir?
Hi!

19:28.252 --> 19:29.795
Emily, good to see you.
Hi. Good to see you.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.922
Kayla, you remember
this beautiful lady here.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.006
Hi.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.133
Thank you so much
for having us.

19:35.217 --> 19:39.346
Oh, my, your dress is beautiful!
I love it. It's gorgeous.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.431
Thank you. We're so glad
you guys could come.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.517
It's our pleasure.
Thanks again.

19:46.270 --> 19:50.357
I'm going to go to the bar and get a drink.
Does anyone want anything?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.920
Is that such a good idea?

19:51.942 --> 19:54.403
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll be right back.

19:57.406 --> 19:58.740
She looks amazing!

19:59.116 --> 20:00.659
She's doing well.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.996
But going away is hard, and so
is coming back, for everyone.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.498
Martin, I just want to
say I wish I had done

20:06.582 --> 20:08.041
a better job of reaching out.
I really do.

20:08.125 --> 20:12.462
No. That's fine. It's the culture.
It's over now.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.383
Good evening, ma'am.
Can I get you something?

20:16.466 --> 20:18.802
Yes, a vodka seltzer, please.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.904
<i>There you go. Enjoy!</i>

20:36.987 --> 20:38.280
Thank you.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.998
Em. So, Martin
was just telling...

20:50.792 --> 20:52.586
Honey, what's wrong?

20:55.339 --> 20:57.007
I can't do this.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.014
You know, I went through a
very bad time last year.

21:05.349 --> 21:06.934
I found a lump.

21:08.185 --> 21:09.853
I just fell apart.
I was so depressed,

21:09.937 --> 21:13.190
and, uh, my doctor prescribed
something called Effexor.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.818
It really helped.

21:21.198 --> 21:23.325
Can you get Martin for me?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.079
Yeah.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.324
Hey.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.076
I'm sorry.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.162
I'm sorry!
I can't, I'm sorry.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.289
It's okay, it's okay.

22:11.790 --> 22:12.791
Come here.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.115
Not so close, ma'am!

23:29.618 --> 23:30.869
Thank you.

23:39.836 --> 23:43.548
Oh, the advantages of having a
husband who can write prescriptions.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.512
What are they called again?

23:48.595 --> 23:50.514
It's a beta blocker.
Hmm.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.352
Is it bad that I'm doing this?

23:55.685 --> 23:56.812
Everyone takes them.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.939
Lawyers, musicians.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.316
People going to
interviews for big jobs.

24:02.526 --> 24:04.111
It doesn't make you
anything you're not.

24:04.194 --> 24:07.697
It just makes it easier for
you to be who you are.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.744
It's between me
and two other people.

24:12.869 --> 24:15.789
A woman from Merrill and a guy from Citicorp.

24:15.831 --> 24:17.457
But Hazlitt says
I have the inside track.

24:17.541 --> 24:21.545
Sorry, D. I've got to return this.
It's an emergency.

24:22.212 --> 24:24.548
This girl is really struggling.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.969
Dr. Banks, I really
need to talk to you.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.053
Emily.

24:30.679 --> 24:33.014
Yeah. I just
got your message.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.058
I'm with my wife.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.564
I went to your office, but you weren't there.
So I came here.

24:41.690 --> 24:43.191
Could we just go talk?

24:44.067 --> 24:46.403
If it's an emergency,
I can admit you.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.321
No. I just, um...

24:51.032 --> 24:53.535
I was getting on
the subway and...

24:57.038 --> 24:59.708
And I was like
when I was in the car.

25:03.753 --> 25:06.506
I have to go to work.
I just need five minutes.

25:06.590 --> 25:08.925
You're going to go
to work after?

25:10.218 --> 25:11.928
Okay, five minutes.
Okay.

25:12.596 --> 25:13.847
I'm sorry.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.307
Call me after the interview.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.275
<i>Emily, I know this is hard.</i>

25:26.234 --> 25:29.029
<i>But the hopelessness you're
feeling is a symptom.</i>

25:29.112 --> 25:31.031
<i>We have to leave
that in the past.</i>

25:32.407 --> 25:34.826
A psychologist once said,

25:34.910 --> 25:37.537
"Depression is an inability
to construct a future."

25:37.621 --> 25:42.459
But you have a future.
At home with Martin.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.964
He's trying to start
a new business.

25:48.757 --> 25:51.635
With this guy Hellman
that he met in jail.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.970
How does that make you feel?

25:54.429 --> 25:56.306
I don't know.
I mean, he's trying.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.059
He's really trying
to make things better

25:59.142 --> 26:02.062
and I'm just not
helping at all.

26:02.771 --> 26:05.232
I mean, I'm trying, too.
I went...

26:07.108 --> 26:10.570
I went shopping to try and make
things more exciting for him.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.489
You are trying.

26:16.618 --> 26:20.038
I can't take the Zoloft anymore.
I can't. I'm dizzy.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.374
I can't sleep.
I have no sex drive.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.417
I understand that.

26:25.126 --> 26:27.462
This woman I work with,
Julia, she...

26:27.671 --> 26:31.383
She said she's on this other, new
medication, and it's really helping her.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.301
I thought maybe
I could try that.

26:38.181 --> 26:39.432
Taylor!

26:44.521 --> 26:46.356
Have you taken Ablixa before?

26:46.523 --> 26:47.649
No.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.484
Some of the side effects
may include

26:50.402 --> 26:54.614
<i>nausea, muscle weakness,
insomnia, change in appetite,</i>

26:54.698 --> 26:57.575
<i>dry mouth, irritation.</i>

26:58.076 --> 26:59.619
<i>Do you want to pay cash?</i>

26:59.703 --> 27:02.747
<i>There were court seats at
Knicks games, fishing trips</i>

27:02.831 --> 27:04.624
to Cape Cod.
It was crazy.

27:04.708 --> 27:07.711
One year, Warner-Lambert
took us to Hawaii.

27:08.044 --> 27:11.631
I gave a talk for five
minutes and played 36 holes.

27:11.715 --> 27:14.301
What did Pfizer have to pay
to make their whole thing go away?

27:14.384 --> 27:15.427
Two billion?

27:15.510 --> 27:17.846
Lilly paid over a billion to
settle the Zyprexa thing.

27:17.929 --> 27:21.141
Do we have to talk about this?
You're ruining my lunch.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.351
A certain rep,
who will remain nameless,

27:23.435 --> 27:25.186
gave me tickets
to the World Series.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.939
Got my son an autographed ball!
Hmm.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.691
If only I'd known
you liked baseball.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.526
Where was I for all this?

27:31.609 --> 27:34.154
Some British
boarding school, probably.

27:34.237 --> 27:37.949
Well, it's not a violation of the
pharma code to buy you doctors lunch

27:38.074 --> 27:40.952
as long as we talk about business
for at least five minutes.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.412
Ready? Go!

27:42.620 --> 27:46.333
We're starting a trial for our
new anti-anxiety drug, Delatrex.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.044
We're looking for a couple
of docs to consult.

27:49.127 --> 27:52.339
It's probably going to run for about a year.
Any interest?

27:52.422 --> 27:55.884
I'm out. I'm doing something for
the competition. Signed an NDA.

27:55.967 --> 27:58.470
You should cancel
her filet for that.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.222
I'm teaching next semester and
feeling a little overextended.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.350
How about you,
Dr. Banks? Too busy?

28:03.433 --> 28:07.103
Not as busy as my partners.
What do you need?

28:07.228 --> 28:09.228
<i>Getting warmer, but, no.</i>

28:10.440 --> 28:11.566
Uh...

28:12.692 --> 28:14.277
Thirty thousand?
Ah!

28:15.403 --> 28:17.155
Fifty thousand.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.531
Really? Wow.
Yes.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.824
Really.

28:19.908 --> 28:21.826
What do you have to do?

28:22.410 --> 28:26.664
Go to a few meetings, recruit
some patients, track some data.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.666
So you'll be even busier.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.959
Yes.

28:30.043 --> 28:34.214
But the flip side is

28:35.090 --> 28:37.384
that if, for instance,

28:37.467 --> 28:40.512
the buttons on this shirt

28:41.471 --> 28:43.431
suddenly fell off,

28:43.807 --> 28:46.518
I would be able
to buy a new one.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.479
Oh, I see.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.439
Mom?

28:51.815 --> 28:53.149
Mmm.

28:53.483 --> 28:57.112
Yes, honey! In here, sweetie.
Just unpacking.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.906
I was having a bad dream.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.408
Oh, love.
Oh!

29:01.491 --> 29:05.829
Honey, you're in luck. Jon
is very good with dreams.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.456
Yes, I am.
So, he's gonna help you.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.666
Back to bed, sweetie.

29:11.334 --> 29:13.837
Do I have to dream
when I sleep?

29:14.170 --> 29:16.339
Yeah, I'm pretty
much sure we all do.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.508
They don't all have to be bad.

29:19.509 --> 29:21.845
Albert Einstein, remember him?

29:21.928 --> 29:23.054
Yeah.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.266
He figured out
relativity in a dream.

29:26.349 --> 29:29.018
And Paul McCartney
wrote entire songs.

29:29.352 --> 29:33.356
And I dreamt of your mom before
I even met her.

29:34.524 --> 29:37.110
So what are you
going to dream about?

30:30.121 --> 30:33.875
Whoever makes this drug is
going to be fucking rich.

30:58.608 --> 30:59.776
Em!

31:01.945 --> 31:05.782
Em! It's the middle of the night.
Turn down the music!

31:10.620 --> 31:11.788
Em?

31:16.292 --> 31:18.336
Are we expecting someone?

31:21.631 --> 31:23.466
Em, can you hear me?

31:27.136 --> 31:29.222
What are you doing?

31:29.305 --> 31:32.016
<i>Can't she stop taking drugs?</i>

31:32.141 --> 31:34.143
Isn't there an alternative
approach... No!

31:34.477 --> 31:36.563
God, no.
I can finally sleep.

31:36.646 --> 31:39.148
I have some energy.
We had sex.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.819
It was like we were
actually together.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.080
Maybe something else
would do the same thing.

31:46.155 --> 31:50.076
Absolutely. There are
still other SSRI's, SNRI's.

31:50.159 --> 31:51.327
No.

31:51.661 --> 31:53.746
I've tried everything else.
You don't know, Martin.

31:53.830 --> 31:56.916
You've never had this. You
don't know what it's like.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.502
Okay? Every afternoon
it's like...

32:01.004 --> 32:03.381
It's like there's this
poisonous fog bank

32:03.464 --> 32:06.009
rolling in on my mind,
and I'm paralyzed.

32:07.176 --> 32:11.347
If I have to start over, I think
I should see a different doctor.

32:14.017 --> 32:16.644
I'm sorry you feel that way.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.855
I understand your frustration.

32:19.397 --> 32:22.108
What do we do?

32:22.191 --> 32:24.569
There are things we
can do to make this work.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.654
<i>Other medications
we add to the Ablixa,</i>

32:26.738 --> 32:28.406
<i>one is designed to
deal with sleepwalking</i>

32:28.489 --> 32:32.285
<i>while the Ablixa helps you get
a handle on your depression.</i>

32:32.368 --> 32:34.537
I'm going to Otisville today.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.541
They finally approved
me to see Hellman.

32:39.876 --> 32:43.254
He's thinking we might want
to set up shop in Houston.

32:44.213 --> 32:47.550
He's got a lot of
connections down there.

32:48.051 --> 32:50.470
I thought we were going to
move back to Greenwich.

32:52.263 --> 32:56.934
I'm sure that we can find
great people in Houston, too.

32:58.227 --> 33:03.066
I want to be totally clear that I am
being paid to participate in this study.

33:04.067 --> 33:06.527
If you don't want to take
part, I totally understand.

33:06.611 --> 33:09.405
There are other meds besides
Delatrex I can prescribe.

33:10.073 --> 33:12.742
So, my medication is free.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.516
I don't have to report it to my
insurance company or anything?

33:15.578 --> 33:19.957
For as long as you choose to be a part
of the study, your meds are free.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.918
Oh, that's great.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.671
We'll start today.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.898
<i>Emily, I don't understand.
It's almost 4:00.</i>

33:44.732 --> 33:46.401
<i>What happened?</i>

33:48.611 --> 33:52.281
I got on the train, and I
just forgot to get off.

33:55.576 --> 33:58.579
Martin is thinking
about moving us,

34:00.415 --> 34:01.916
and I'm just

34:03.584 --> 34:04.961
really...

34:07.463 --> 34:09.215
Go home, Emily.

34:10.091 --> 34:13.052
But you have to know
this can't happen again.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.097
It's not working for me.

34:58.556 --> 34:59.557
Hey.

35:02.602 --> 35:04.061
Hey. Hey.

35:04.854 --> 35:06.481
What's happening?

35:08.691 --> 35:11.360
They gave it to the guy
from Citicorp.

35:11.861 --> 35:14.030
Oh, I'm sorry, D.

35:15.364 --> 35:18.034
It's fucking hopeless.

35:42.433 --> 35:43.601
Emily?

35:46.437 --> 35:50.441
Hellman says you are
going to love Houston.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.528
What'd you get me?

35:56.280 --> 35:57.448
Em?

36:02.787 --> 36:03.955
Em?

36:06.624 --> 36:08.960
God damn it. Em?

36:09.126 --> 36:10.962
These fucking pills.

36:17.802 --> 36:18.928
Em.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.807
You sleeping again?

36:24.934 --> 36:25.935
Stop!

36:27.436 --> 36:28.521
Ahh!

36:43.578 --> 36:45.454
Em, call somebody.

36:46.747 --> 36:48.082
Help me.

36:48.457 --> 36:49.959
Call somebody.

36:51.460 --> 36:52.795
Help me.

37:59.236 --> 38:00.947
Did he hit you?

38:01.739 --> 38:03.366
Did he threaten you?

38:11.540 --> 38:14.710
Was anyone else here? Who
else was coming for dinner?

38:16.420 --> 38:17.755
What?

38:21.092 --> 38:23.260
I was asleep and I...

38:24.095 --> 38:27.181
I woke up and I saw him.
He wasn't...

38:27.264 --> 38:28.766
He wasn't moving.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.602
And that's all...
That's all I remember.

38:36.107 --> 38:37.400
<i>Dr. Siebert.</i>

38:37.608 --> 38:40.987
Hello, there. I'm sorry to bother you.
It's Jon Banks.

38:41.445 --> 38:42.947
It's about Emily.

38:43.072 --> 38:44.532
<i>Uh, there's been an incident.</i>

38:45.741 --> 38:46.993
<i>No sign of forced entry,</i>

38:47.076 --> 38:48.911
<i>nobody else on the
building security camera.</i>

38:48.995 --> 38:50.121
The prints on
the knife are hers.

38:50.204 --> 38:51.664
Where is her lawyer?

38:51.747 --> 38:55.042
She doesn't have one.
Just kept talking about you.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.670
No sign of struggle
on either one of them.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.046
She made the 911 call herself.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.757
We had an appointment last night
that she didn't show up for.

39:03.926 --> 39:05.469
When was the last
time you saw her?

39:05.553 --> 39:06.637
Four days ago.

39:07.096 --> 39:08.431
And what was she like?

39:11.267 --> 39:14.061
Any idea why the dinner table
was set for three, Dr. Banks?

39:14.145 --> 39:18.274
She doesn't remember anything
about a guest. Kids?

39:19.442 --> 39:21.610
No, she didn't have children.

39:22.111 --> 39:23.946
She was taking these.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.574
For depression, right?
I've seen the ads.

39:26.657 --> 39:28.367
She ever talk to you
about something like this?

39:28.451 --> 39:30.578
I'd like to speak to her,
if that's possible.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.204
You can talk to her at Rikers.

39:32.288 --> 39:34.707
It's possible, you see,
that she was asleep.

39:36.292 --> 39:37.418
What?

39:37.501 --> 39:38.586
She walks in her sleep.

39:38.669 --> 39:40.212
That's maybe why she
doesn't remember anything.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.214
It's a side effect
of this medication.

39:43.966 --> 39:46.802
She's had other episodes.

39:47.970 --> 39:50.473
She kills people
in her sleep, too.

39:55.978 --> 39:58.773
Stand up, please.
And turn around.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.276
<i>She ever tell you anything to</i>

40:02.359 --> 40:05.571
make you believe she could
be violent, or that he was?

40:05.654 --> 40:07.448
And before you answer that

40:07.531 --> 40:11.869
or tell me about some kind of
patient-doctor confidentiality thing,

40:12.661 --> 40:14.997
let's just think
about the future here.

40:15.998 --> 40:17.333
The future?

40:18.334 --> 40:21.337
Well, this goes one of
two ways, doesn't it?

40:21.670 --> 40:25.841
See, either she's a murderer or

40:26.884 --> 40:29.136
she's a victim of
her medical treatment.

40:29.845 --> 40:33.182
In which case, you're the
target of a big civil suit.

40:33.849 --> 40:37.186
<i>Either way,
someone gets punished.</i>

40:37.853 --> 40:40.231
<i>Her or you.</i>

40:43.192 --> 40:46.237
<i>The state's enjoyed working with
you in the past, Dr. Banks.</i>

40:47.071 --> 40:49.824
<i>I'd like to see you consulting
with us on this one.</i>

40:50.699 --> 40:53.035
This is different.

40:54.036 --> 40:55.204
Is it?

40:59.875 --> 41:02.545
I never want to see
another pill again.

41:04.046 --> 41:06.549
They want me to
take something else.

41:07.216 --> 41:09.510
Another pill to help me sleep.

41:13.722 --> 41:16.517
I don't understand
why this is happening.

41:21.230 --> 41:23.232
Is there any way that

41:23.899 --> 41:25.901
somebody else did it,

41:26.402 --> 41:28.404
and made it look like me?

41:32.283 --> 41:34.285
I don't think so.

41:37.079 --> 41:39.748
That's not what
the police are saying.

41:47.756 --> 41:49.842
I killed the wrong person.

41:52.636 --> 41:56.390
I don't know what else I could have done.
She wanted to stay on it.

41:56.473 --> 41:59.018
Jon. You can't
follow them around

41:59.101 --> 42:00.686
taking things
out of their hands

42:00.769 --> 42:02.855
they might use to
hurt themselves.

42:02.938 --> 42:06.192
We see them for an hour a day,
maybe a couple of times a week.

42:06.275 --> 42:08.027
I think they're
going to charge her.

42:08.110 --> 42:09.445
With what?

42:09.945 --> 42:13.616
You said she has no memory.
No criminal intent.

42:13.949 --> 42:15.576
They can't do that.

42:16.619 --> 42:18.621
<i>A man in Arizona.</i>

42:18.829 --> 42:20.664
He killed his wife,
threw her in the pool,

42:20.748 --> 42:23.209
took off his bloody clothes, put
them in the trunk of his car.

42:23.292 --> 42:25.711
Woke up the next morning,
no memory of it.

42:25.794 --> 42:28.088
Didn't even know she was dead until
they charged him with the crime.

42:28.172 --> 42:31.050
Neighbors even saw him
throw the body into the pool.

42:31.133 --> 42:33.636
He was acquitted last year.

42:34.970 --> 42:38.599
A woman bludgeoned her husband while
on vacation in Sanibel Island.

42:38.682 --> 42:42.102
They were both asleep at the time.
Another acquittal.

42:42.186 --> 42:45.147
I have to tell you, I have
been approached by the state

42:45.231 --> 42:46.732
to consult for them as well.

42:46.982 --> 42:48.651
I assumed as much.

42:49.026 --> 42:53.030
I am in a rather difficult spot here.
I hope you appreciate that.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.532
I know you are,
but if she goes away,

42:55.616 --> 42:56.617
this does not
look good for you.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.953
It just makes the whole
system look bad.

43:01.705 --> 43:03.958
She ever talk about
killing her husband?

43:04.041 --> 43:05.960
No. If she had, I would
have reported it.

43:06.669 --> 43:08.963
You spoke to any of the family?

43:09.046 --> 43:11.340
Martin's mother. She's
the one who hired me.

43:14.343 --> 43:16.178
We need your help.

43:21.517 --> 43:23.519
You want to talk about it?

43:29.024 --> 43:31.360
A patient of mine was arrested.

43:34.363 --> 43:36.031
For something bad?

43:36.365 --> 43:38.701
Yeah. Pretty bad.

43:42.705 --> 43:44.540
Did the person do it?

43:45.874 --> 43:47.584
Are they guilty?

43:52.548 --> 43:54.133
In this case,

43:55.050 --> 43:57.845
those are two very
different things.

44:38.761 --> 44:42.181
I was afraid you would never
want to see me again.

44:45.100 --> 44:49.605
I hope you know that if I could
trade places with Martin, I would.

44:50.105 --> 44:54.026
I would give anything if there were
someone who could make that deal.

44:54.109 --> 44:57.780
I just don't understand
how it happened. How?

44:58.781 --> 45:00.282
I don't know.

45:01.116 --> 45:04.787
I don't know. It doesn't fit for me.
It's like...

45:07.122 --> 45:09.291
It's like it never happened.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.835
But I don't understand it.

45:12.127 --> 45:15.964
You watch the commercials on
TV, people are getting better!

45:16.632 --> 45:19.927
I was getting better. Dr. Banks
was really helping me.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.805
But, he just got out

45:23.639 --> 45:25.516
and now he's gone.

45:26.517 --> 45:27.851
I know.

45:31.146 --> 45:33.148
Can I give you something?

45:34.525 --> 45:35.567
What?

45:35.651 --> 45:37.861
I want to make a statement.

45:45.202 --> 45:47.830
People need to know
what can happen.

45:48.831 --> 45:50.707
For Martin's sake.

45:51.542 --> 45:52.835
<i>"We go to doctors</i>

45:53.502 --> 45:55.212
<i>with our sadness</i>

45:55.295 --> 45:58.173
<i>and our faith in the hope they
will guide us toward health."</i>

45:59.216 --> 46:02.553
<i>"But instead I have gone
down a path toward a misery</i>

46:02.845 --> 46:05.097
<i>I never could
have imagined."</i>

46:05.514 --> 46:08.267
<i>"And I have taken
my loved ones with me."</i>

46:09.184 --> 46:13.730
<i>"My only hope is that no one
else follows me to this place."</i>

46:14.690 --> 46:17.651
<i>And again, this is a
note from your daughter-in-law.</i>

46:17.734 --> 46:18.777
<i>Yes.</i>

46:18.861 --> 46:20.946
<i>Who may face murder charges.</i>

46:21.029 --> 46:22.030
<i>Yes.</i>

46:22.364 --> 46:24.616
<i>For what a drug made her do.</i>

46:24.700 --> 46:29.496
<i>We invited a representative from
Sadler-Benelux, the makers of Ablixa,</i>

46:29.580 --> 46:31.290
<i>to come here this morning</i>

46:31.373 --> 46:34.001
<i>and discuss this very tragic
story, but they declined.</i>

46:34.084 --> 46:37.212
<i>However, our Dr. Peter Joubert,
in fact, a Manhattan psychiatrist</i>

46:37.379 --> 46:40.132
<i>who specializes in anti-depression
drugs like Ablixa,</i>

46:40.215 --> 46:41.300
<i>is here to discuss</i>

46:41.383 --> 46:43.051
<i>the dangers of
these side effects.</i>

46:43.135 --> 46:46.513
<i>Peter, if nothing else, this seems
a very troubling gray area.</i>

46:46.597 --> 46:50.476
<i>Josh, it is. And that is
why the FDA, in 2004,</i>

46:50.559 --> 46:53.562
<i>asked that anti-depressants come
with a black box warning...</i>

46:53.645 --> 46:54.980
Which one,
zucchini or asparagus?

46:55.063 --> 46:57.107
<i>...because their use was
associated with an increased risk</i>

46:57.191 --> 46:59.485
<i>of suicidality in
children and adolescents.</i>

46:59.568 --> 47:02.529
Zucchini or asparagus?
I don't know. Both.

47:02.613 --> 47:05.093
<i>That warning was expanded to
include young adults in their 20s.</i>

47:05.115 --> 47:07.951
<i>Peter, where's
the doctor in all this?</i>

47:08.035 --> 47:09.786
<i>What's his or her
responsibility?</i>

47:10.078 --> 47:12.331
<i>I'm sure people have
a lot of questions for him.</i>

47:12.831 --> 47:15.151
What about the permission
slip for the field trip?

47:15.209 --> 47:16.376
Do you have that?

47:16.460 --> 47:19.171
Did you remember?
Are you excited? What?

47:20.839 --> 47:23.175
- There he is! Dr. Banks!
- Did someone famous...

47:23.258 --> 47:25.427
How long have you been
seeing Emily Taylor?

47:25.511 --> 47:26.512
Seeing who?

47:26.595 --> 47:28.680
Did you know that your husband
was treating Emily Taylor?

47:28.764 --> 47:29.890
Take him out of here.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.016
What is happening?

47:31.099 --> 47:32.226
Go that way!

47:32.309 --> 47:33.310
What about this picture?

47:33.393 --> 47:34.603
Have you seen the front
page of the <i>Post</i> today?

47:34.686 --> 47:35.938
You have no comment
about any of this?

47:36.021 --> 47:37.856
No, not at the moment.

47:37.940 --> 47:39.024
Do you have any comment
at all about this?

47:39.107 --> 47:42.027
I have no comment. She's my patient.
That's all I can say.

47:42.110 --> 47:43.195
What's your relationship?

47:43.362 --> 47:45.906
I saw some press
people downstairs.

47:46.949 --> 47:48.784
I think they had cameras.

47:49.618 --> 47:51.370
Is that for you?

47:55.040 --> 47:56.708
There's a back stairway,

47:56.792 --> 47:59.711
if you'd be more comfortable
leaving that way.

48:03.715 --> 48:07.135
My wife never liked
me coming here.

48:09.721 --> 48:12.474
I'm worried she's
going to see something.

48:14.393 --> 48:16.603
It's going
to be a "thing."

48:17.062 --> 48:19.565
Was she the one
with the blonde hair?

48:20.065 --> 48:24.486
I think I saw her in the elevator.
She seemed totally normal.

48:24.570 --> 48:27.155
I'd really like to focus more
on what's going on with you.

48:27.239 --> 48:29.908
What was she taking? It's
not what I'm taking, is it?

48:29.992 --> 48:32.244
No. You're taking
something else.

48:33.412 --> 48:35.747
You'd...
You'd tell me, right?

48:36.248 --> 48:38.875
As part of the Office's
medical conduct review,

48:38.959 --> 48:41.670
we'll need to have access
to your charts and records.

48:41.753 --> 48:44.172
Current and past patients.

48:47.926 --> 48:50.596
Absolutely.
Whatever you need.

48:51.597 --> 48:55.934
You went to school
in the UK, at Durham.

48:56.018 --> 48:57.019
Mmm.

48:57.102 --> 48:59.896
What made you decide to
practice here in the States?

49:00.772 --> 49:04.693
Where I come from, if anyone
goes to see a psychiatrist

49:04.776 --> 49:07.446
or takes medication, the
assumption is they're sick.

49:07.529 --> 49:09.865
Here, the assumption
is they're getting better.

49:09.948 --> 49:11.116
I see.

49:12.451 --> 49:17.122
You first came in contact with Miss
Taylor after a suicide attempt.

49:18.707 --> 49:21.043
She drove her car into a wall.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.962
You decided not
to hospitalize her?

49:26.131 --> 49:29.301
She described her suicide
attempt as a mistake.

49:30.469 --> 49:33.055
And expressed a desire
to get better.

49:33.805 --> 49:35.891
Her husband wanted
her home as well.

49:36.016 --> 49:40.187
In addition, she had no
history of violent behavior.

49:40.812 --> 49:43.649
Driving a car into
a wall isn't violent?

49:45.400 --> 49:48.195
I didn't think she posed
a risk to others.

49:48.987 --> 49:51.156
I saw her regularly,
here in my office,

49:51.239 --> 49:53.909
and consulted with her
previous doctor as well.

49:53.992 --> 49:55.577
Dr. Siebert.
Hmm.

49:56.161 --> 49:57.996
I've spoken to her.

50:00.082 --> 50:03.460
You also do work at the
hospital, a number of shifts.

50:04.336 --> 50:06.004
Sometimes nights.

50:06.338 --> 50:09.508
And you said you're doing
pharmaceutical consulting.

50:10.342 --> 50:12.678
That's a pretty large workload.

50:14.262 --> 50:16.098
My wife lost her job.

50:16.348 --> 50:20.352
And we have a boy, my
stepson, in private school.

50:21.853 --> 50:24.398
I bought a new place
downtown, too.

50:26.942 --> 50:32.447
So, longer hours, higher volume
of patients, more stress.

50:47.045 --> 50:48.672
Anything else?

50:51.883 --> 50:54.970
I'll need to ask your
partners some questions.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.513
Of course.

51:00.016 --> 51:03.145
<i>They can't come after
you for any of this, right?</i>

51:04.146 --> 51:06.481
<i>No, that's not going to happen.</i>

51:06.898 --> 51:08.650
They don't blame me.

51:11.737 --> 51:13.905
I'm just an expert witness.

51:14.740 --> 51:17.743
Like I was on that case
with the kid from Uganda

51:17.826 --> 51:20.370
who couldn't
stop stealing stuff.

51:22.748 --> 51:26.835
They just need me to explain
things to the jury. That's all.

51:27.753 --> 51:30.589
So after the trial, it's over.

51:31.089 --> 51:32.424
Absolutely.

51:35.260 --> 51:37.929
<i>She was sad.
Very sad.</i>

51:38.013 --> 51:39.347
Every day.

51:41.016 --> 51:42.684
Did she say why?

51:42.934 --> 51:46.605
No. It is just
how she was.

51:46.688 --> 51:48.064
<i>Some people slip.</i>

51:49.441 --> 51:52.277
Some jump.
We keep an eye out.

51:53.612 --> 51:56.948
I remember her.
Right on the edge.

51:58.283 --> 51:59.951
She worried me.

52:00.619 --> 52:02.621
<i>What makes us human?</i>

52:02.954 --> 52:05.540
What differentiates us
from, let's say, insects,

52:05.624 --> 52:07.709
is that we have consciousness.

52:07.793 --> 52:11.963
An awareness of what we're
thinking and what we're doing.

52:12.297 --> 52:16.968
If, for example, I'm hungry,
lam consciously aware of that.

52:17.302 --> 52:20.889
And so, I go to the fridge
and I make myself a sandwich.

52:20.972 --> 52:24.142
So you intend to
make a sandwich.

52:24.226 --> 52:25.393
Yes.

52:27.479 --> 52:31.274
So, what you are saying
is that to have intent,

52:31.358 --> 52:32.734
we must also have
consciousness.

52:32.818 --> 52:34.694
Objection, Your Honor.

52:35.153 --> 52:38.573
The question calls for a legal
conclusion, not a medical one.

52:38.657 --> 52:39.908
Overruled.

52:40.325 --> 52:41.993
You may continue.

52:44.162 --> 52:46.081
Consciousness
provides a context,

52:46.164 --> 52:48.083
or meaning, for our actions.

52:48.166 --> 52:50.836
If that part of you
doesn't exist, then,

52:50.919 --> 52:53.922
basically, we are functioning
much like an insect,

52:54.005 --> 52:57.259
where you just
respond instinctively

52:57.342 --> 52:59.845
without a thought to
what your actions mean.

52:59.928 --> 53:01.680
And that part...

53:01.763 --> 53:04.641
That part that provides
meaning to action,

53:04.724 --> 53:06.268
does that exist
when we're asleep?

53:06.351 --> 53:07.936
No.
No.

53:09.771 --> 53:12.607
So, without consciousness,
how do we prove intent?

53:12.858 --> 53:14.693
I don't believe you can.

53:15.193 --> 53:16.514
<i>I think she'll take it.</i>

53:17.279 --> 53:21.283
But she does not walk out of the
hospital next week, or next month.

53:21.533 --> 53:23.118
She goes away for a while.
That's part of the deal.

53:23.201 --> 53:24.369
She'll have to agree to that.

53:24.452 --> 53:26.413
You think that'll work?

53:27.706 --> 53:30.750
I can get Dr. Banks to
help explain it to her.

53:31.376 --> 53:34.129
Here's what we're
prepared to live with.

53:34.212 --> 53:36.131
State agrees to an NGRI.

53:36.214 --> 53:38.967
We make a side agreement about
how long she's institutionalized

53:39.050 --> 53:41.386
before there's any sort of
hearing on her release.

53:41.887 --> 53:44.723
So I'm not guilty,
but I'm still going away?

53:44.806 --> 53:47.726
NGRI means Not Guilty for
Reasons of Insanity.

53:47.809 --> 53:49.644
You're not guilty of murder.

53:49.728 --> 53:52.439
You'll be moved to the Wards
Island Forensic Psychiatry Center

53:52.522 --> 53:53.565
for a period of time.

53:53.648 --> 53:54.733
But I can't leave.

53:54.816 --> 53:56.526
No, not for a while.

53:56.610 --> 53:58.445
You'll be under observation.

53:58.528 --> 54:01.573
I'm not crazy.
You know I'm not crazy.

54:02.073 --> 54:06.494
In my opinion, you are a victim
of circumstance and biology.

54:08.079 --> 54:09.998
Isn't your opinion
the one that counts?

54:10.081 --> 54:12.208
No, I'm just one doctor.

54:12.292 --> 54:15.003
It may help to have you examined
by another psychiatrist.

54:15.086 --> 54:16.922
We should get Dr. Siebert.

54:17.005 --> 54:19.166
She's known me for a lot
longer, and she could testify.

54:19.174 --> 54:22.928
Dr. Siebert's records have already
been submitted to the D.A.

54:23.011 --> 54:26.014
And you weren't in her care
at the time of the murder.

54:27.682 --> 54:31.770
But if I'm just a victim of
circumstance and biology...

54:33.438 --> 54:36.149
it was the Ablixa.
You told me I should stay

54:36.232 --> 54:39.361
on the Ablixa. I would never be
here if it weren't for that.

54:39.444 --> 54:43.448
Emily, if you take this plea, as soon
as a psychiatrist says you're ready,

54:43.531 --> 54:45.075
we'll apply for your release.

54:45.450 --> 54:47.118
What if I say no?

54:48.453 --> 54:50.622
Then we keep going.

54:51.289 --> 54:54.292
But they have a body, they have
your prints on the murder weapon,

54:54.376 --> 54:55.710
and they have you
at the crime scene.

54:55.794 --> 54:58.546
We can't argue that you
didn't do any of that, so,

54:58.630 --> 55:01.800
one day, it goes to the
jury and maybe they acquit,

55:01.883 --> 55:03.301
you walk out of
here on your own.

55:03.385 --> 55:05.345
Or maybe it goes the other way.

55:06.388 --> 55:08.390
Well, what do you think?

55:08.974 --> 55:10.475
I will tell you what I know.

55:10.725 --> 55:13.770
An NGRI defense is only
successful 1% of the time,

55:13.853 --> 55:16.314
and they are giving
you that today.

55:16.398 --> 55:17.482
<i>You're fucking kidding me.</i>

55:17.607 --> 55:20.986
Nobody here has ever had a bad result?
Nobody here has had

55:21.069 --> 55:23.154
a client react
to a side effect?

55:23.238 --> 55:26.574
Your arrogance here is breathtaking.
You take no responsibility?

55:26.658 --> 55:29.077
For her body's reaction
to a medicine?

55:29.160 --> 55:30.412
It only just came
on the market!

55:30.495 --> 55:32.872
She has come up in a number
of my sessions as well.

55:32.956 --> 55:34.666
It's become a part of
the environment here.

55:34.749 --> 55:36.793
I have clients who are afraid
to take their medications.

55:36.918 --> 55:39.038
We had the state board here.
It's on the nightly news.

55:39.087 --> 55:42.924
Look, I spoke with her lawyer and the D.A.
We worked it out.

55:43.008 --> 55:44.968
She's taking an NGRI.

55:45.051 --> 55:47.554
She's going to hospital for observation.
It's behind us.

55:47.637 --> 55:48.930
It's all gonna go away.

55:49.014 --> 55:51.516
Bullshit, Jon! It is
splashed all over you!

55:51.599 --> 55:54.102
It's going to follow
you around forever.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.937
And us, too, if we're
standing next to you.

55:56.021 --> 55:58.940
What does that mean? If
she's not guilty, why am I?

55:59.024 --> 56:00.650
Rational people may
look at it like that,

56:00.734 --> 56:02.902
but we don't see a great
many rational people here.

56:02.986 --> 56:04.067
You can see what I'm saying?

56:04.070 --> 56:07.032
We shouldn't even have to ask.
You should see what's happening.

56:07.115 --> 56:09.242
But that seems hard for you!

56:20.045 --> 56:22.130
Do you think I screwed up?

56:23.214 --> 56:24.799
I don't know.

56:27.886 --> 56:31.014
I noticed the Taylor woman
in the waiting room.

56:31.097 --> 56:32.640
She was very attractive.

56:32.891 --> 56:35.643
A wounded bird. Fragile.

56:36.561 --> 56:39.397
Would you have treated her
differently if she was a man?

56:39.481 --> 56:40.732
Gene.

56:41.399 --> 56:44.069
That's not what happened.

56:44.736 --> 56:47.572
Maybe it's time
for you to slow down.

56:48.073 --> 56:50.825
Your client load is down.
Get some cheaper space.

56:50.909 --> 56:52.660
Focus on what's
going on with you.

56:52.744 --> 56:54.245
Unbelievable.

56:55.747 --> 56:57.499
I received a letter, Jon.

56:57.665 --> 56:59.084
I haven't shared
it with anyone,

56:59.167 --> 57:01.836
but I think it
will likely surface.

57:02.170 --> 57:03.588
What kind of letter?

57:06.758 --> 57:09.594
It's about Alison Finn.

57:12.388 --> 57:13.890
<i>It was during my residency.</i>

57:13.973 --> 57:16.810
There was a walk-in clinic
at the university.

57:16.893 --> 57:19.312
I saw her maybe three times.

57:20.355 --> 57:21.856
She saw other people
there as well,

57:21.940 --> 57:25.193
called the suicide
line every other night.

57:25.276 --> 57:27.362
She was a
paranoid schizophrenic

57:27.445 --> 57:30.615
and a drug addict.
Very sick girl.

57:30.698 --> 57:32.075
She knew where you lived.

57:32.158 --> 57:33.159
She stalked me.

57:33.243 --> 57:35.870
The letter says you
took her to London.

57:36.371 --> 57:37.622
Never.

57:38.123 --> 57:39.791
Why are they writing this?

57:39.874 --> 57:41.876
Their daughter
committed suicide

57:41.960 --> 57:44.879
and left a very
graphic note, naming me.

57:45.964 --> 57:48.633
It never happened. Look.

57:49.300 --> 57:52.804
It's not unusual for there to be
emotional transference between

57:52.887 --> 57:54.722
a patient and a therapist.

57:54.806 --> 57:57.725
Had her perform
oral sex in your car?

57:57.809 --> 58:00.562
Never! It was a fantasy!

58:54.782 --> 58:57.493
<i>Depression can
take away your energy.</i>

58:59.662 --> 59:01.998
<i>It can steal away your time.</i>

59:50.505 --> 59:51.881
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

59:51.965 --> 59:53.716
<i>I had a patient who
was having an affair.</i>

59:53.800 --> 59:56.761
Came in here every week like
he was going to confession.

59:56.844 --> 59:59.847
Cried, repented.
Didn't stop.

01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:04.310
Then one day, he comes
in and says it's over.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:08.690
He's finally got a handle on his
issues, like some great epiphany.

01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:12.819
It was about six
or seven months later

01:00:12.902 --> 01:00:17.740
his wife turns up and says he has a
whole other family in another state.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.035
He'd been lying to her.

01:00:21.703 --> 01:00:23.496
And he was lying to me.

01:00:24.998 --> 01:00:29.335
The kids blamed me. The wife blamed me.
Even the patient blamed me.

01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:32.380
At times, I blamed me.

01:00:33.881 --> 01:00:39.137
The point is the cardiologist can
see it coming, the heart attack,

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.473
from the tests.
It's in the blood.

01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:45.893
But who can see the lies?

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:49.063
Or the past, or the sadness?

01:00:53.568 --> 01:00:56.404
You didn't tell me
you wrote the article.

01:00:57.572 --> 01:01:01.242
We were consulting on a
patient, not comparing résumés.

01:01:01.409 --> 01:01:03.953
It would have been
a little self-involved

01:01:04.037 --> 01:01:05.580
for me to mention it,
don't you think?

01:01:06.414 --> 01:01:08.833
It wasn't about me,
it was about Emily.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:12.420
Why didn't you tell me
about the sleepwalking?

01:01:12.754 --> 01:01:14.088
Me tell you?

01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:16.049
She told you about them.

01:01:16.758 --> 01:01:18.509
And you kept her on the Ablixa.

01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:20.762
It was a decision
you made, Jon.

01:01:22.597 --> 01:01:24.140
How did you know that?

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:25.224
Know what?

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:31.939
That she had more than one episode.
How would you know that?

01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:36.527
Did she have them when
she was your patient?

01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:39.113
I know because
it's in the news.

01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:41.449
That's how I know.

01:01:42.617 --> 01:01:44.243
Everyone knows.

01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:47.789
Everyone knows everything, Jon.

01:01:58.633 --> 01:02:00.510
Like that?
At that speed?

01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:02.720
No, faster than that.
Oh, faster than that.

01:02:02.804 --> 01:02:06.182
Yeah, and she was
carrying the seat belt.

01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:07.809
She was wearing the seat belt?
Are you sure?

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:09.143
Yeah, I saw it!

01:02:13.481 --> 01:02:16.818
<i>One moment, you're living high
on the hog, and the next moment,</i>

01:02:16.901 --> 01:02:20.238
you're visiting your hubby
in jail, eating ramen?

01:02:20.321 --> 01:02:22.407
Who wouldn't be depressed?

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.826
And then what happened...

01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:28.329
Oh, God, it's just so tragic.

01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:33.251
I've suffered from my own
depression, so I understand.

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:35.294
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:41.676
"Every afternoon, around 3:00, like
a poisonous fog bank rolling in

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:44.345
on my mind,
and I'm paralyzed."

01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:45.930
"A poisonous fog"?

01:02:46.055 --> 01:02:48.349
That's not me. It's William Styron.
Yes. William Styron.

01:02:48.433 --> 01:02:50.101
<i>Darkness Visible.
Darkness Visible.</i>

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:53.855
<i>There are times when I feel I
could have written it, but...</i>

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:56.649
<i>So is she</i>

01:02:56.858 --> 01:02:58.526
doing any better?

01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:00.361
I'm keeping an eye on her.

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:18.171
Excuse me.
Are you Julia?

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.215
Julia? Are you Julia?

01:03:23.384 --> 01:03:26.304
Sorry to disturb you.
Are you Julia? No.

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:28.139
Julia? Are you Julia?

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.724
No, I'm Joan.
Julia.

01:03:29.849 --> 01:03:31.976
Is there a... Are you Julia?
No, I'm Susan.

01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:33.339
Is there something else?

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:36.189
I wanted to speak
to her friend, Julia.

01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:40.234
Julia? I don't think we have
a Julia that works here.

01:03:40.693 --> 01:03:41.903
Really?

01:03:43.905 --> 01:03:44.989
Hey.

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:47.575
Look at this.

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:52.288
She knew all about airbags and seat belts.
Fucking commercial runs

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:55.374
on a loop in the lobby
where she works.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.962
Where were you? What?

01:04:00.922 --> 01:04:03.090
You forgot me at school.

01:04:03.591 --> 01:04:05.593
I was here.
I was doing this.

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:08.221
Honey, go to your room. Start your homework.
I'll be there in a minute.

01:04:08.304 --> 01:04:09.805
I'm sorry.

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:14.519
What is all this?
The Delatrex thing?

01:04:14.602 --> 01:04:16.562
No, look, I went to her office.

01:04:16.646 --> 01:04:19.607
There is no Julia at
work who takes Ablixa.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.568
What are you talking about?

01:04:22.652 --> 01:04:24.820
Why did she make up Julia?

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:29.784
I don't know.
Isn't she sick?

01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:33.621
I thought sick people
sometimes make things up.

01:04:37.124 --> 01:04:38.364
<i>So you're feeling better.</i>

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:42.129
<i>Yeah, much better.
I've been doing a lot of, um,</i>

01:04:42.255 --> 01:04:46.217
running on the treadmill here to try and
get in shape and stimulate serotonin.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.428
You're not feeling like
you're in a "poisonous fog"?

01:04:50.263 --> 01:04:51.430
No.

01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:53.599
No, not so much anymore.

01:04:55.268 --> 01:04:57.812
That phrase really
stuck with me.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:00.314
How did you come by it?

01:05:02.775 --> 01:05:04.986
I don't know, really. Um...

01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:07.530
I guess it's just...

01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:10.575
I guess that's how
I felt back then.

01:05:10.658 --> 01:05:13.369
You know, maybe I heard it
or read it somewhere.

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:19.000
Back on the boat with Martin, we used
to always see the fog rolling in.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:22.962
I'm sure a lot of depressed
people have felt that way before.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:28.467
The important thing is that I
think the fog is finally lifting.

01:05:28.676 --> 01:05:32.680
And I really think I'm going to
be ready to get out of here soon.

01:05:37.143 --> 01:05:40.396
I have to go, I'm sorry. I
have a meeting in the city.

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:46.485
Do you think maybe, uh, next time
you could stay a little longer?

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.156
It's just I don't have
any other visitors

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:53.868
and this is really all I
have to look forward to.

01:05:55.161 --> 01:05:57.830
What about your friend, Julia?

01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:01.000
Julia?

01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:04.003
Yes. From the ad agency.

01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:08.674
Oh, Julia. No, I worked
with Julia at the bar.

01:06:09.342 --> 01:06:13.179
I haven't heard from her
since everything happened.

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:16.515
I haven't heard
from most people.

01:06:21.062 --> 01:06:22.188
Are you okay?

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:30.529
I know what it's like to have your
entire life change out from under you.

01:06:32.365 --> 01:06:37.036
The only difference is, you didn't
do anything wrong and Martin did.

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:39.622
<i>So, the reason I called.</i>

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:43.186
I mean, with all the attention
in the paper on the Taylor case,

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.294
and with the ethics
probe and such,

01:06:45.378 --> 01:06:48.047
I wanted to tell
you that, um...

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.801
We need to ask you to
step off the study.

01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:53.524
I'm sure it's all blown
out of proportion,

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.680
but we can't have you
on the payroll now.

01:06:55.763 --> 01:06:57.682
I could be anonymous.

01:06:58.224 --> 01:06:59.892
Still do the work.

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:02.561
I'm real sorry.

01:07:02.895 --> 01:07:05.272
I feel horrible about this.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.070
Maybe you can be part of another
study when this is over.

01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:12.697
All right, then.

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.408
The funny thing is, with
Sadler-Benelux in the toilet,

01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:17.076
we're up like 30%.

01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:18.452
What?

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:22.998
The guys down on Wall Street are cashing
in because of what happened with Ablixa.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:25.251
Worked out super well for us.

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:27.294
<i>You can bet
on a stock to go down,</i>

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:29.797
<i>just like you can
bet on it to go up.</i>

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.716
A few days before 9/11,

01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:36.554
there was a huge surge in the
purchase of options of airline stock.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:39.181
No one knows why.
It's a complete mystery.

01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:42.435
But United fell 40%
after the planes crashed

01:07:42.518 --> 01:07:44.353
and people made a lot of money.

01:07:44.437 --> 01:07:45.604
And it isn't illegal.

01:07:45.688 --> 01:07:48.190
Thinking something's going
to happen isn't illegal

01:07:48.274 --> 01:07:50.693
Breaking the law to make it
happen is a different story.

01:07:50.776 --> 01:07:53.904
Jon, I know what insider trading is.
I used to work in finance.

01:07:53.988 --> 01:07:56.198
Sure, you do,
but, look. See!

01:07:57.491 --> 01:08:00.327
Hey. See what happened
at Sadler-Benelux

01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:02.079
right after Martin Taylor died.

01:08:02.163 --> 01:08:04.165
Down. Way down.

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:08.669
AziLyle, on the other
hand... up. Way up.

01:08:09.003 --> 01:08:11.881
She did it. She made
it happen, do you see?

01:08:11.964 --> 01:08:13.424
Do you see?
Ablixa was her idea!

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:16.510
But you prescribed it.
You did that.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.015
I got a job today.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.103
Huh? They offered me full time.

01:08:26.187 --> 01:08:28.397
I left you a message
this morning.

01:08:28.481 --> 01:08:31.192
I didn't hear. My phone was
off 'cause I was at the hospital.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.611
Hopefully with this and the consulting
money we can finally get back...

01:08:33.694 --> 01:08:37.363
No, the Delatrex thing is over.
It's gone.

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:40.033
They fired me.

01:08:41.202 --> 01:08:42.368
What?

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:45.038
When?
Today

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:49.376
That's why I have to make
this thing with Emily work.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.296
I'm not letting another
Alison Finn happen,

01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:53.421
so I'm fucking
fighting this time!

01:08:53.506 --> 01:08:55.424
I don't want to hear
about Emily or Alison.

01:08:55.508 --> 01:08:57.028
But this is starting
to make sense now!

01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:59.011
No, it's not making sense!

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:03.474
It doesn't make sense that you're
sitting here doing this all day long!

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.392
The case is over.

01:09:06.352 --> 01:09:09.145
The photographers are gone,
your partners are gone,

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:11.732
the Delatrex thing is now gone.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.319
You're the only one
that's still here.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.738
I just want to
know what happened.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:22.576
A woman you were treating
killed her husband.

01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:25.746
That's what happened.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:33.212
<i>But I already told the truth.</i>

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:36.131
That's what this
test will help to prove.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:37.758
How does it do that?

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:40.719
It helps to show your
true state of mind.

01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:44.765
Sodium amytal gives us a
window into someone's psyche.

01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.308
It lowers inhibitions.

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:50.104
We make a video of the test
and we show it to the judge.

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:54.525
It's just you know
how I feel about drugs.

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:57.570
Emily, this is the
fastest way out of here.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:00.698
What does it do to me?

01:10:00.781 --> 01:10:03.576
Initially, you'll
feel light-headed.

01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:08.455
And then you will get a
sense of well-being. Calm.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:12.543
After a few minutes, you'll probably
get drowsy and fall asleep.

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:14.336
What do you do while
that's happening?

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.880
I ask questions.

01:10:15.963 --> 01:10:19.633
You answer. You say whatever
you feel about what happened.

01:10:19.925 --> 01:10:22.678
What motivated you to come and
see me in the first place?

01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:25.139
My motivation was to
get over my depression

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:26.891
and to have a life
with my husband.

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:28.893
Then that's what
this will show.

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:31.103
What if I say something else?

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:34.565
What do you mean?

01:10:35.107 --> 01:10:39.403
I just mean, what if I say something
that makes my situation worse?

01:10:41.113 --> 01:10:45.451
You say anything you're not happy
with, I'll destroy the video.

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:52.708
How old are you, Emily?

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.251
Twenty-eight.

01:10:55.169 --> 01:10:56.712
Where are we?

01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:02.176
Wards Island
Psychiatric Forensic Center.

01:11:04.345 --> 01:11:06.680
What is the capital
of New York?

01:11:08.515 --> 01:11:09.850
Albany.

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:13.395
Do you know why you're here?

01:11:15.022 --> 01:11:17.191
Because my husband is dead.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:19.193
How did he die?

01:11:20.361 --> 01:11:23.864
They said I stabbed him,
but I can't remember.

01:11:25.366 --> 01:11:27.952
Did you want him dead? Did
you kill Martin on purpose?

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:29.203
No.

01:11:30.496 --> 01:11:34.708
I wanted us to sail away together
on the boat, all three of us.

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:37.544
The three of you?

01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:40.172
Madeleine.

01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:42.633
What happened to Madeleine?

01:11:43.884 --> 01:11:46.053
I lost her because I was sad

01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:50.015
and she didn't want to stay
inside a sad person anymore.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.563
He gave me so much and
then they took him away.

01:11:56.897 --> 01:11:59.233
I wanted to give
him a daughter.

01:12:00.234 --> 01:12:03.445
But you killed him.

01:12:05.072 --> 01:12:07.157
Were you angry with him?
Did you hate him?

01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:11.036
No. I never would have hurt him.
I loved everything about him.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.372
The way he smelled,

01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:16.625
his hands. Everything
about him, I loved.

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:18.669
Did you do it for the money?

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:20.254
Like he did?

01:12:23.257 --> 01:12:24.425
Emily.

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:28.220
I loved everything about him.

01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:31.015
<i>Emily, can you hear me?</i>

01:12:31.098 --> 01:12:32.099
<i>I can't remember.</i>

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.601
That's what she said in
her statement. She doesn't remember.

01:12:34.685 --> 01:12:35.769
She's lying.

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:37.604
What does her
falling asleep prove?

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:39.969
You have to destroy this. You're
torturing the poor woman.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:49.783
It's saline.

01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:53.203
I gave her saltwater.

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:54.329
What?

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:55.831
There was no drug.

01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:58.625
So, why did she pass out?

01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:02.796
You don't put in a performance
like that on saltwater.

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:06.383
Call the hospital.
Order a blood test.

01:13:06.467 --> 01:13:09.470
You won't find any
amytal in her system.

01:13:10.304 --> 01:13:12.765
She's been lying
this whole time.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.317
Destroy that.

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.028
No. Call the hospital.

01:13:26.695 --> 01:13:28.155
Order a blood test.
Not a chance.

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:30.657
We have her. Arrest her.
Dr. Banks...

01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:32.034
I want my life back!

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.452
Destroy it before
it destroys you.

01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:36.080
She knew the safety
features of the car...

01:13:36.163 --> 01:13:38.248
You don't want to say
that to me or to anyone.

01:13:38.373 --> 01:13:40.542
Another thing. Sadler-Benelux is down.
Stop talking, Dr. Banks.

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:42.086
Stop! It's too late! Millions
of dollars were made!

01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:44.922
No! You could have
worked with us! I asked.

01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:48.342
The verdict's in. It's too fucking
late for whatever that circus is

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:49.426
that you just showed me.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:51.637
You see, we can't
just start over.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.889
We have double jeopardy
laws in this country.

01:13:53.972 --> 01:13:55.599
Check her bank account.

01:13:55.682 --> 01:13:58.519
We did. We always do. Nothing.

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:02.397
No insurance policy, no stock
holdings, no inheritance from Martin.

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:03.482
She's not depressed.

01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:05.692
And you didn't catch it
and someone died.

01:14:07.486 --> 01:14:10.781
And I didn't catch it and
someone didn't go to jail.

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:12.199
We failed.

01:14:13.325 --> 01:14:16.120
See, that's what your little stunt proves.
If it proves anything,

01:14:16.203 --> 01:14:18.205
it proves we got beat.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.958
And that you lied to a woman

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:24.211
who's not guilty about what
you were putting in her arm.

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:26.685
Now, I don't know how
you feel about that,

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.133
but I would rather it
stay between you and me.

01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:32.803
You were never here.

01:14:33.345 --> 01:14:35.013
<i>Just come out there</i>

01:14:35.222 --> 01:14:38.142
and see her once. Please.

01:14:38.225 --> 01:14:40.060
She wasn't depressed.

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:42.271
I actually can prove it.

01:14:42.354 --> 01:14:44.106
Why would I examine her now?

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:46.650
Is that what you wanted to see me about?
Shit, Jon!

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:49.611
I solved it finally, on my own.
Just come see her.

01:14:49.695 --> 01:14:51.488
You're stuck in
some old place, Jon.

01:14:51.572 --> 01:14:53.157
I think you need someone
to help pull you out.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.118
I can refer someone good.
Are you still seeing her?

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:58.287
I'm consulting. I'm her
expert on this case.

01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:59.788
Well, that has to stop!

01:14:59.872 --> 01:15:03.073
You want to make it go away, you go out
to Wards Island and resign from the case.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.126
Step off.
I can't do that.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:06.336
Well, then it's not
going to go away.

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.964
Okay, you won't come and
see her with me? No.

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:10.424
Can I ask you something else?
What?

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:13.594
Some Adderall. Just a short
term, 20 milligrams.

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:16.930
That's why you called, isn't it?
I'm struggling

01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:20.517
to hold focus here, Gene. That's
what it's for, to help people focus.

01:15:20.601 --> 01:15:21.685
You want to focus on something,

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:23.562
focus on never
seeing her again.

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:30.152
<i>D, I've been thinking
about what you said.</i>

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:33.614
Look, you're right.
It's time to move on.

01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:36.116
I'm heading over to
Wards Island right now.

01:15:36.283 --> 01:15:38.368
<i>I'm not gonna see her again.</i>

01:15:59.056 --> 01:16:00.891
You went to see Emily.

01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:02.643
Damn right, I did.

01:16:03.894 --> 01:16:05.134
You could have called me first.

01:16:05.187 --> 01:16:06.563
She called me.

01:16:06.647 --> 01:16:08.357
She was very upset.

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:11.026
It was kind of a dramatic
stunt to pull on a woman

01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:14.196
who's already in a great
deal of emotional pain.

01:16:14.905 --> 01:16:17.407
I don't understand
your thinking.

01:16:20.035 --> 01:16:22.579
I'm trying to determine
her state of mind

01:16:22.663 --> 01:16:25.666
so I can chart the best
course of treatment.

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:27.167
"Treatment"?

01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:29.795
You gave an amytal
interview to a woman

01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:32.089
who's been declared not guilty.

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:34.424
I hope you learned something.

01:16:34.508 --> 01:16:35.842
Oh, I did.

01:16:36.426 --> 01:16:38.262
Quite a lot, actually.

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:42.849
I think she requires
more observation.

01:16:42.933 --> 01:16:44.643
And she'll need more
medication as well.

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:07.082
This is Dr. Siebert
on Bridge Street.

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:10.127
I'd like an envelope
delivered to Manhattan.

01:17:16.925 --> 01:17:18.010
Hey.

01:17:22.014 --> 01:17:23.598
Where's the little guy?

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:26.351
Fuck!

01:17:26.727 --> 01:17:28.478
I'm not going to
go to the police,

01:17:28.562 --> 01:17:30.564
or whomever one goes
to in this situation.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.774
I'm just going to go away.

01:17:33.525 --> 01:17:35.777
What? Wait! Hey, wait!

01:17:35.861 --> 01:17:37.029
Wait?

01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:40.407
Wait for this to happen again?

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.368
Another Alison or Emily?

01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:47.372
Oh, wow. See?

01:17:47.706 --> 01:17:50.375
Okay, these prove everything.

01:17:50.542 --> 01:17:52.085
She took these.

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:56.214
These were sent by a
friend of the husband's.

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:57.341
No, that's not true.

01:17:57.424 --> 01:17:59.092
Stay away from us.

01:18:00.385 --> 01:18:01.595
Wait! Dierdre!

01:18:03.221 --> 01:18:05.974
Dierdre. Dierdre,
wait a minute.

01:18:06.058 --> 01:18:08.226
No, Jon. Wait a minute.
Hello, love.

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:24.284
<i>You have two unheard messages.</i>

01:18:24.368 --> 01:18:25.619
<i>First unheard message.</i>

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:28.705
<i>Yes, Dr. Banks?
This is Jeffrey Childs</i>

01:18:28.789 --> 01:18:31.541
<i>from the Office of
Medical Conduct Review.</i>

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:35.670
<i>I have some questions about Alison Finn.
Can you call me at...</i>

01:18:36.797 --> 01:18:38.215
<i>Deleted.</i>

01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:41.885
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:44.805
<i>I'm sure you've received
my latest notes</i>

01:18:44.888 --> 01:18:47.224
<i>concerning the Emily
Taylor case by now.</i>

01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:49.851
<i>There is, I think you'll agree,</i>

01:18:49.935 --> 01:18:52.062
<i>a different course
of treatment to pursue</i>

01:18:52.145 --> 01:18:55.649
<i>that is in everyone's
best interest.</i>

01:18:55.732 --> 01:18:58.402
<i>Maybe we can meet
for a coffee? Thanks.</i>

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:01.446
<i>Saved.
End of new messages.</i>

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:04.574
<i>Check erased messages.
Press 1-9.</i>

01:19:05.492 --> 01:19:08.578
<i>You could get
national coverage on this.</i>

01:19:09.246 --> 01:19:11.248
"Shrinks fucking patients

01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:14.501
and manipulating them
into killing their spouses."

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.002
Hot stuff.

01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:20.173
I would say this would
ruin your practice.

01:19:20.424 --> 01:19:22.008
But wait.

01:19:22.092 --> 01:19:24.261
You don't have
a practice anymore

01:19:24.845 --> 01:19:28.682
or a wife or a kid,
I'm betting.

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:32.436
So what else can you lose?

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:36.606
Martha can certainly use those
in a wrongful death suit.

01:19:37.524 --> 01:19:39.359
State revoke your license, yet?

01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:43.947
I always tell my patients,

01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:46.950
"You know what the best predictor
of future behavior is?"

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:49.369
"Past behavior."

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:52.122
Well, you don't have
any more patients.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:55.959
The only problem with having
a crazy person for a partner

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:57.794
<i>"is they tend to stay crazy.</i>

01:19:58.545 --> 01:20:00.005
You should know
how difficult it is

01:20:00.088 --> 01:20:02.549
to cure a pretty girl
with daddy issues.

01:20:02.632 --> 01:20:05.677
Nice try, Jon.
I'm not buying it.

01:20:05.969 --> 01:20:08.305
Spend the fucking money now.

01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.641
Because they're
coming to take it back.

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:15.979
What are you talking about?

01:20:17.314 --> 01:20:18.815
You could go and ask her.

01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:21.735
Only she asked me to keep
you from seeing her.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.654
She told me everything.

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:34.164
Everything? No, I'll
tell you everything.

01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:36.666
You wouldn't be here if
you had nothing to lose.

01:20:36.917 --> 01:20:40.086
She already got a "not guilty" verdict.
You, on the other hand...

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:42.923
Fuck you! You get her out of
there right now, you hear me?

01:20:43.215 --> 01:20:46.218
You do that and you won't hear
from either one of us again.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.261
Yeah, you can go back
to chatting with

01:20:48.345 --> 01:20:50.430
rich white people
about their problems.

01:20:50.597 --> 01:20:53.600
She's cured,
as of right now, Jon.

01:20:54.351 --> 01:20:56.686
You're a fucking genius!

01:21:00.941 --> 01:21:04.277
<i>She's been
very agitated lately.</i>

01:21:04.361 --> 01:21:07.239
I think it best we
restrict her visitors.

01:21:07.614 --> 01:21:11.034
And no phone calls, either,
without notifying me first.

01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:13.620
She's been resisting
her medication as well.

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:16.164
Very confrontational
with the staff.

01:21:16.248 --> 01:21:18.041
She seems to be getting worse.

01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:19.876
Mmm. I was afraid of that.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.549
That's a mouth guard.

01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:29.386
It stops her smashing her
teeth, biting her tongue off.

01:21:29.636 --> 01:21:32.389
The current lasts
for about five seconds.

01:21:34.474 --> 01:21:36.434
They'll have administered
a paralytic agent,

01:21:36.518 --> 01:21:38.478
but they put a tourniquet
on the ankle, you see?

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:41.064
To make sure she
is having a seizure.

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:44.150
Keep your eye on that foot.

01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:48.446
It's actually been shown
to be remarkably effective

01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:49.770
for treating severe depression.

01:21:49.823 --> 01:21:52.242
None of the side effects
you get with pills.

01:21:52.325 --> 01:21:55.328
No idea what it might
do to a normal person.

01:21:55.912 --> 01:21:58.373
I also wanted to
give you another test.

01:21:58.456 --> 01:22:01.918
A personality inventory. Just a
series of true-or-false questions.

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:03.753
<i>First saved voice message.</i>

01:22:03.837 --> 01:22:05.714
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:08.133
<i>I'm sure you've received
my latest notes</i>

01:22:08.216 --> 01:22:10.427
<i>concerning the Emily
Taylor case by now.</i>

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:11.761
Not a very subtle tool,

01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:13.513
but the results will be
of interest to the board.

01:22:13.597 --> 01:22:15.557
<i>...a different course
of treatment to pursue</i>

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.683
<i>that is in everyone's
best interest.</i>

01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:18.935
They like hard data to look at.

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:21.813
Wait. What is she saying?

01:22:22.606 --> 01:22:23.773
Who?

01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:31.281
I don't think you should
be my doctor anymore.

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:33.450
I think you should
resign my case.

01:22:37.203 --> 01:22:39.623
Victoria's paying me
way too much for that.

01:22:40.457 --> 01:22:43.126
Out of your share, I assume.

01:22:44.628 --> 01:22:47.380
The shock treatment was her idea.
It damages the memory.

01:22:48.423 --> 01:22:52.510
It's in our best interest
that you start forgetting.

01:22:54.638 --> 01:22:56.890
Are you ready for your
treatment, Ms. Taylor?

01:23:01.478 --> 01:23:03.813
Oh, no, I scheduled
it for tomorrow.

01:23:14.407 --> 01:23:15.742
I need to use the phone.

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:17.827
You can be next.

01:23:22.499 --> 01:23:24.668
I need to call my lawyer now.

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:28.004
Are you going to be long?

01:23:28.338 --> 01:23:30.139
You going to be long?
I need to use the phone.

01:23:31.675 --> 01:23:34.344
Are you going to be long?
Isn't there a time limit?

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:36.513
I need to call someone. My
shrink is fucking with me.

01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:38.723
Can you get off now?

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.434
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor.
You've been restricted.

01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:43.687
By who?
By Dr. Banks?

01:23:43.895 --> 01:23:47.440
He's not my doctor anymore.
He attacked me. He's sick.

01:23:47.857 --> 01:23:49.567
Miss Taylor,
you need to step back.

01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:52.737
Get off the phone.
Get off the phone!

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:55.699
Miss Taylor, you need to relax.

01:23:58.034 --> 01:24:00.537
Get me Dr. Siebert!
This is bullshit!

01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:04.791
I shouldn't even be here! I'm not sick!
Get me Dr. Siebert! No! No!

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.543
Relax! Relax!

01:24:07.335 --> 01:24:09.254
No, I don't want it!
I don't want it!

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:12.215
Yes. Dr. Siebert?

01:24:12.882 --> 01:24:14.217
Dr. Banks.

01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:19.055
I've been thinking about our last conversation.

01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:20.557
Yes.

01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:23.727
An idea occurred to me.

01:24:24.436 --> 01:24:25.478
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:27.480
Maybe I am a genius.

01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:45.498
Hello there! Best we don't
talk inside, right?

01:24:45.582 --> 01:24:47.000
Talk about what?

01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:49.919
Uh, she wants to go before
the judge this week.

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:51.921
And what is she going to say?

01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:53.923
Well, it depends.

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:57.177
She could tell a long, sordid
story about her former shrink.

01:24:57.844 --> 01:24:59.971
Suggest the SEC investigate.
The whole story.

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:02.307
That would make national
coverage, wouldn't it?

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:05.852
And what do you get out of it?
Oh, I don't know.

01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:10.774
Peace of mind. Like
I said, it depends.

01:25:17.197 --> 01:25:18.364
No.

01:25:19.783 --> 01:25:21.284
No, no.

01:25:23.203 --> 01:25:26.539
This will be the last time we speak.
Okay?

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:32.295
You get her released, and we
go back to being strangers.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.217
Unless, of course, you want
to consult on other patients.

01:25:42.806 --> 01:25:43.973
No.

01:26:40.864 --> 01:26:43.700
The staff told me you were
having a difficult time.

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.706
So, I've added medication
that will help.

01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:03.303
If I tell you the truth,
do I have to take the pills?

01:27:06.723 --> 01:27:09.893
I won't be able to tell the
truth if I take any more pills.

01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:44.654
<i>Imagine everything
you ever wanted</i>

01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:47.156
<i>shows up one day and
calls itself your life.</i>

01:28:48.658 --> 01:28:51.744
<i>And then, just when you
start to believe in it...</i>

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:55.498
<i>Gone. And suddenly,
it gets</i>

01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:58.292
<i>very hard to imagine a future.</i>

01:28:58.918 --> 01:29:01.087
<i>That's depression, right?</i>

01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:15.852
<i>So I went to
see Dr. Siebert.</i>

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:19.063
<i>We talked about my childhood.</i>

01:29:19.147 --> 01:29:22.108
<i>About disappointment
and Mommy and Daddy.</i>

01:29:22.692 --> 01:29:24.861
<i>And I told her about Martin.</i>

01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:27.613
<i>And she told me that her
marriage with her husband</i>

01:29:27.697 --> 01:29:30.116
<i>had never been anything
but a meeting of minds.</i>

01:29:31.034 --> 01:29:33.870
<i>And minds start to
wander after a while.</i>

01:29:34.871 --> 01:29:38.207
<i>He had traded her in for a
younger model, so she was</i>

01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:41.711
<i>alone and lonely.
It didn't take much.</i>

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.215
<i>I think she always liked girls,</i>

01:29:46.299 --> 01:29:48.885
<i>she just never found one
she liked as much as me.</i>

01:29:52.055 --> 01:29:54.223
<i>She taught me how
to be depressed.</i>

01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:58.061
<i>What drugs had
which side effects.</i>

01:29:58.895 --> 01:30:01.564
<i>What symptoms went
with what diagnosis.</i>

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:03.983
<i>And I taught her
everything Martin</i>

01:30:04.067 --> 01:30:06.819
<i>ever told me about
derivatives and deals.</i>

01:30:08.071 --> 01:30:10.573
<i>The trades were in her name.
So I forgave Martin.</i>

01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:13.117
<i>I went to visit on the weekends</i>

01:30:13.201 --> 01:30:15.578
<i>and told him that
I would wait for him.</i>

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:34.430
<i>What do you doctors
call faking?</i>

01:30:34.514 --> 01:30:35.723
<i>"Malingering"?</i>

01:30:36.933 --> 01:30:38.601
<i>Such a funny word.</i>

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:42.814
<i>Girls learn to fake things
at a very early age.</i>

01:30:42.897 --> 01:30:46.359
<i>Probably around the same time
that boys are learning to lie.</i>

01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:55.618
<i>We needed everyone to see how much
I wanted it to work out with us.</i>

01:30:55.701 --> 01:30:57.703
<i>How much I loved my husband.</i>

01:30:58.287 --> 01:31:00.957
<i>And how terribly
depressed I was.</i>

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.337
<i>When did you
decide to kill him?</i>

01:31:06.462 --> 01:31:09.298
<i>It's not a decision
you make just once.</i>

01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:12.260
<i>You make it over
and over again,</i>

01:31:12.343 --> 01:31:14.679
<i>every time you
look at your life</i>

01:31:14.762 --> 01:31:17.932
<i>and you see the position you're
in and who put you there.</i>

01:31:18.015 --> 01:31:19.809
<i>And it all leads back to him.</i>

01:31:19.892 --> 01:31:23.187
<i>Each and every fucking
problem, every disappointment.</i>

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.857
<i>And you think to yourself,</i>

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:29.986
<i>"Maybe if he just goes away,
it'll all get better."</i>

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.629
<i>Everything would have
worked out perfectly</i>

01:31:48.713 --> 01:31:51.174
<i>if you had just disappeared
after the trial</i>

01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:53.676
<i>like you were supposed to.</i>

01:31:54.093 --> 01:31:55.428
<i>Why me?</i>

01:31:56.095 --> 01:31:58.264
Was it because of Alison Finn?

01:31:59.515 --> 01:32:03.186
That was just
a happy coincidence.

01:32:03.603 --> 01:32:05.855
A convenient distraction.

01:32:06.522 --> 01:32:07.523
It didn't have to be you.

01:32:07.607 --> 01:32:09.150
It could have been
you or anyone else

01:32:09.233 --> 01:32:11.277
who walked into my room
with a prescription pad.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.448
We didn't go looking for you,
we just looked at the world.

01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:24.332
<i>I read somewhere that
there's a difference</i>

01:32:24.415 --> 01:32:26.500
<i>between tears of joy
and tears of rage.</i>

01:32:26.584 --> 01:32:27.960
<i>Is that true?</i>

01:32:28.711 --> 01:32:30.880
<i>It's in the chemistry, but
you can't tell by looking</i>

01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:33.424
<i>they all just look like tears.</i>

01:32:43.476 --> 01:32:47.146
Hello? Hello, I think I need help!
I think my...

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:51.150
My husband's bleeding and I think he's...
I think he's been stabbed

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.987
and he's dead. He's dead,
I think he's dead.

01:32:55.321 --> 01:32:58.324
I think he's dead!
You need to send someone!

01:32:58.658 --> 01:32:59.992
Please!

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:11.671
You never did take
the Paxil, did you?

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:14.173
No.

01:33:14.423 --> 01:33:15.758
Or the Zoloft.

01:33:16.175 --> 01:33:17.343
No.

01:33:17.677 --> 01:33:19.345
Only the Ablixa.

01:33:20.179 --> 01:33:22.348
Didn't really do
anything for me.

01:33:26.185 --> 01:33:28.437
So, when did she
start paying you?

01:33:35.528 --> 01:33:39.365
She always knew you'd
turn on her someday

01:33:42.868 --> 01:33:44.704
like you did with Martin.

01:33:47.331 --> 01:33:50.835
Past behavior is the best
predictor of future behavior.

01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:54.171
That's what she said about you.

01:33:56.382 --> 01:33:59.677
And how long do you two
plan on keeping me here?

01:34:04.307 --> 01:34:07.643
Why would we ever
let you leave?

01:34:09.729 --> 01:34:11.063
Because

01:34:12.565 --> 01:34:14.734
maybe there's a better deal.

01:34:26.162 --> 01:34:29.665
<i>Over the course of her
confinement, I've come to the conclusion</i>

01:34:29.749 --> 01:34:32.460
<i>with a reasonable degree
of medical certainty</i>

01:34:32.543 --> 01:34:36.589
<i>that Emily Taylor is neither
mentally ill or dangerous</i>

01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:41.052
at this time. I believe
with the proper treatment

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.389
she is not a threat
to herself or others.

01:34:45.473 --> 01:34:47.975
In my opinion,
she's ready to move onto

01:34:48.059 --> 01:34:50.019
the next phase
of rehabilitation

01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:52.271
with ongoing supervision,
as outlined

01:34:52.855 --> 01:34:55.858
in the outpatient
order of conditions.

01:34:56.525 --> 01:35:01.030
The risk of relapse back into a
dangerous mental state is low.

01:35:02.365 --> 01:35:06.118
I've submitted to the court the
conditions under which I believe

01:35:06.202 --> 01:35:09.955
the order of confinement
may be rescinded.

01:35:11.123 --> 01:35:13.709
And do you, Ms. Taylor,
understand

01:35:13.793 --> 01:35:16.504
that if you violate the
terms of your release,

01:35:16.587 --> 01:35:19.382
I will have to issue a new
order of confinement?

01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:20.883
Yes, Your Honor.

01:35:44.073 --> 01:35:47.076
I text her like 20 times a day.

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:50.746
Zach, you're beginning
to see a pattern, right?

01:35:51.247 --> 01:35:55.418
Everyone leaves. It's not
a pattern, it's a fact.

01:35:55.751 --> 01:35:58.671
And how does this connect
to you being adopted?

01:35:58.963 --> 01:36:00.714
I think it started there.

01:36:01.257 --> 01:36:03.008
And now I'm making it happen.

01:36:03.092 --> 01:36:05.886
You know, I get scared that
people will leave and then

01:36:06.804 --> 01:36:11.392
I, uh,
end up making them leave.

01:36:11.475 --> 01:36:14.186
Excuse me, Dr. Siebert,
I think someone wants you.

01:36:17.106 --> 01:36:21.944
Uh, I'm sorry, Zach,
this is an emergency.

01:36:22.695 --> 01:36:24.405
We're gonna have to
pick this up next time.

01:36:24.488 --> 01:36:26.282
You didn't tell Banks
anything, did you?

01:36:26.365 --> 01:36:28.033
Of course not.

01:36:28.993 --> 01:36:31.662
How much did you have to
pay him to get me out?

01:36:31.996 --> 01:36:35.166
It doesn't matter. You're out.
It's taken care of.

01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:37.710
You didn't leave
me much choice.

01:36:38.419 --> 01:36:40.921
What did you do with
the rest of the money?

01:36:41.172 --> 01:36:42.840
Two accounts.

01:36:43.174 --> 01:36:45.843
Mine's in Dubai,
yours is in Grand Cayman.

01:36:49.472 --> 01:36:51.348
God.

01:36:53.017 --> 01:36:54.894
Are you sure you didn't
tell him anything else?

01:36:54.977 --> 01:36:56.312
Yes, I'm sure.

01:36:56.395 --> 01:37:00.733
Because there are SEC violations.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

01:37:01.025 --> 01:37:02.568
I'm exposed here.

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:04.028
Yes, you are.

01:37:04.111 --> 01:37:05.696
And I'm vulnerable.

01:37:09.533 --> 01:37:11.535
Oh, God, I missed you.

01:37:15.706 --> 01:37:19.210
You taught me to be
such a sad, sad girl.

01:37:21.045 --> 01:37:23.214
Do I look sad now?

01:37:27.718 --> 01:37:29.637
Do you remember the first time?

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.804
Yeah.

01:37:30.888 --> 01:37:32.556
Do you remember
how wet I made you?

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.641
Oh, yeah.

01:37:33.724 --> 01:37:35.559
Do you want to do that again?

01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:37.603
Yeah.

01:37:58.457 --> 01:38:00.292
What the fuck is that?

01:38:00.584 --> 01:38:02.920
You didn't leave
me much choice.

01:38:05.089 --> 01:38:06.757
Oh, my God.

01:38:13.097 --> 01:38:15.057
Dr. Siebert,
you're under arrest.

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.684
You're being charged
with conspiracy to

01:38:16.767 --> 01:38:19.103
commit murder and
securities fraud.

01:38:49.967 --> 01:38:53.429
...within the next 10 minutes.
I think she's just arrived.

01:38:53.512 --> 01:38:55.014
Yeah, she's here.

01:38:56.682 --> 01:38:58.183
And thank you.

01:39:04.565 --> 01:39:06.609
Here I am.
Cured at last.

01:39:06.692 --> 01:39:07.693
You're late.

01:39:07.776 --> 01:39:09.194
How long do I have to stay?

01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:18.203
I'm going to put you
on some medication.

01:39:18.662 --> 01:39:20.164
What?

01:39:20.914 --> 01:39:23.250
This is for Thorazine.

01:39:23.834 --> 01:39:26.211
It's a tranquilizer,
been around for years.

01:39:26.837 --> 01:39:28.255
You know the people
shuffling around

01:39:28.339 --> 01:39:30.924
like zombies with vacant
eyes in the prison ward?

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.968
They were on Thorazine.

01:39:34.178 --> 01:39:36.513
So this is for Depakote.

01:39:37.514 --> 01:39:40.017
It'll settle your mood,

01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:41.685
but hair loss

01:39:42.519 --> 01:39:43.854
is a side effect.

01:39:47.358 --> 01:39:48.525
What is this?

01:39:48.734 --> 01:39:50.653
As part of our arrangement,
I'll also be sending you

01:39:50.736 --> 01:39:52.279
to the Gramercy for urine tests

01:39:52.363 --> 01:39:55.491
to make certain you take your meds.
And I'm seeing you again

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:58.577
tomorrow, all right?
Try not to be late.

01:39:58.661 --> 01:40:00.496
Angry people are
frequently late.

01:40:00.579 --> 01:40:01.830
This is bullshit!

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:04.917
You sound angry. Have you
read the court order?

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.419
You have to obey the
terms of your release.

01:40:07.711 --> 01:40:09.380
Yeah, I'm here.

01:40:09.588 --> 01:40:13.384
Those terms mandate that if I
believe you are a danger in any way

01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:16.387
I need to send you back
to hospital immediately.

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.056
If I don't, I'm in
violation of the law.

01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:22.601
I got Siebert for you.
I'm a cooperating witness.

01:40:22.726 --> 01:40:25.479
"Very noncompliant..." The
deal was I testify against her

01:40:25.604 --> 01:40:27.445
and I get out. "...With
a history of violence."

01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:29.441
This isn't out, this is fucked!
"Dangerous."

01:40:29.608 --> 01:40:32.152
I think this needs
a new diagnosis.

01:40:32.236 --> 01:40:34.029
Based on what?
What did I do?

01:40:34.113 --> 01:40:35.364
To the question,

01:40:35.447 --> 01:40:38.117
"There are objects and creatures
all around us only I can see,"

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.326
you answered, "True."

01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:41.995
You filled that out!
Schizoaffective disorder.

01:40:42.079 --> 01:40:43.706
I think I need
to send you back.

01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:50.921
Mrs. Taylor!

01:40:55.092 --> 01:40:56.593
Emily Taylor!

01:40:57.594 --> 01:40:59.263
Miss Taylor, stop!

01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:06.437
Central,
we have a 330-20.

01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:09.106
No, he's lying!
He's lying!

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.609
I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
I promise I'm not sick!

01:41:12.693 --> 01:41:15.779
He's the sick one! He
just wants the money!

01:41:15.863 --> 01:41:17.865
No, I'm not sick, I promise!

01:41:17.948 --> 01:41:19.908
Don't bring me back,
I don't want to go back!

01:41:19.992 --> 01:41:22.870
I don't want to go back!
I don't want to go back!

01:42:38.362 --> 01:42:40.697
How are you doing today, Emily?

01:42:43.617 --> 01:42:44.952
Better.

01:42:48.247 --> 01:42:49.915
Much better.
