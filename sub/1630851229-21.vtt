Go to the ER at Atlanta General.

12:20.223 --> 12:22.465
-I'm the CEO.
-Surgeon.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.992
Go.

12:31.159 --> 12:32.667
How's she doing?

12:34.737 --> 12:38.465
We stabilized her enough
to go to the OR, but it's bad.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.595
This is related
to the Medicare fraud ring.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.338
Yes.

12:46.324 --> 12:48.558
Are we still keeping
that a secret?

12:49.511 --> 12:51.436
No.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.396
There's no need
for secrets anymore.

12:55.758 --> 12:58.943
Cade was a whistleblower.
She was working with the FBI.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.263
Blew open a mob operation.

13:02.265 --> 13:05.617
And they came for her.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.494
Okay, then.

13:09.848 --> 13:12.165
(monitor beeping rapidly)

13:15.020 --> 13:16.277
BELL:
We were just about to take her

13:16.279 --> 13:17.629
to the OR when her pressure
and sats dropped.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.964
We're behind on resuscitating
her with blood products.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.258
Well, let's get a pressure bag
on that blood.

13:25.363 --> 13:27.454
All right,
another unit going in.

13:27.456 --> 13:29.123
BELL:
There's no increase
in abdominal free fluid.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.384
She must be bleeding
somewhere else.

13:31.386 --> 13:33.036
CONRAD:
No blood in the chest tube.

13:33.038 --> 13:35.480
(beeping speeds up)

13:35.482 --> 13:37.223
She's desatting.

13:37.225 --> 13:39.567
Raise it to 100% on the vent.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.703
Temp?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.724
102.4.

13:54.726 --> 13:56.075
She wasn't febrile before.

13:56.077 --> 13:58.394
Stop the blood.

13:58.396 --> 13:59.729
Hawkins, she'll bleed out.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.080
No, she's not just losing blood.

14:01.082 --> 14:03.675
-Her body's also destroying it.
-Transfusion reaction.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.069
Yes, she tried to tell me
something about blood.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.587
She must have a rare type.

14:07.589 --> 14:10.073
And we can't take her
to the OR like this.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.908
Any more blood could kill her.

14:11.910 --> 14:15.019
♪

14:22.253 --> 14:24.420
-Okay, thanks.
-Talk to me.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.513
The blood bank confirmed it.
Severe hemolytic

14:26.515 --> 14:28.515
-transfusion reaction.
-Didn't she get O negative?

14:28.517 --> 14:30.535
Yes, and that would be fine
for most everyone else,

14:30.537 --> 14:32.261
but Cade reacted to it
because she has

14:32.263 --> 14:34.205
a very rare blood type: Rh null.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.449
Well, I hope they're prepping
Rh null for the OR.

14:36.451 --> 14:37.691
I mean, that's where
she needs to go now.

14:37.693 --> 14:39.452
We don't have any,
and I bet that no one else

14:39.454 --> 14:41.195
-in Georgia does, either.
-If you operate

14:41.197 --> 14:42.547
and can't transfuse her,
odds are, she won't

14:42.549 --> 14:44.624
-make it off the table.
-Yeah, but she's losing blood

14:44.626 --> 14:46.533
from her spleen and who knows
where else as we speak.

14:46.535 --> 14:48.461
If I sit on that,
she'll die, for sure.

14:48.463 --> 14:50.513
It's a risk we have to take.

14:51.783 --> 14:53.466
All right, here's the plan.

14:53.468 --> 14:55.393
You take her to the OR,
remove her spleen.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.303
Get in and out
as quick as possible.

14:57.305 --> 14:59.213
-Damage control.
-BELL: Yeah, I'll take
out her spleen

14:59.215 --> 15:00.398
and fix whatever else
could kill her,

15:00.400 --> 15:01.958
but this is
a temporary solution.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.101
And then bring her back to
the ICU, keep her abdomen open.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.403
Uh, so we're ready to get back

15:05.405 --> 15:07.296
into the OR as quickly
as possible.

15:07.298 --> 15:09.490
Once we get compatible blood.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.488
-You want me in there?
-No, there's no need.

15:15.490 --> 15:16.989
What we're doing right now
is just a Band-Aid.

15:16.991 --> 15:18.082
It's quick and dirty.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.584
But there will be
a much larger surgery

15:19.586 --> 15:21.477
to put all this back together
as soon as we get the blood.

15:21.479 --> 15:22.645
-I will need you then.
-All right.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.814
Let's get Dr. Devi to assist.
Is she here?

15:24.816 --> 15:26.424
-I wouldn't know.
-I'll page her.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.334
And I'll ask Billie to start
the hunt for compatible blood.

15:28.336 --> 15:30.094
Well, tell her
to pull out all the stops.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.337
I mean, I'll do
what I can in there,

15:31.339 --> 15:33.473
but that blood
is what's gonna save her.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.084
Bell's on deck.

15:37.086 --> 15:38.327
I need you in Cade's OR.

15:38.329 --> 15:39.829
I'll be there. Will she be okay?

15:39.831 --> 15:42.089
Don't ask questions. Just focus.

15:42.091 --> 15:44.258
The world doesn't stop.
I've got a patient.

15:44.260 --> 15:45.759
He's kicking up a fuss.

15:45.761 --> 15:48.521
He needs an expedited
lung transplant eval.

15:48.523 --> 15:50.264
-Can you do it?
-Well, I'm all yours

15:50.266 --> 15:52.858
until they find blood for Cade.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.343
Pulmonary fibrosis.

15:54.345 --> 15:56.621
Meets BMI criteria,
otherwise healthy.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.458
Jimmy Miller. The podcast host?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.610
-You've heard of him?
-Yeah. He's a nitwit.

16:03.612 --> 16:06.856
He's a performance artist.
Says anything to get attention.

16:06.858 --> 16:09.525
Anti-government, anti-gluten,
whatever sells at the moment.

16:09.527 --> 16:12.378
-Presently, he's anti-vax.
<i> -DEVON: Look,</i>

16:12.380 --> 16:14.455
all transplant recipients
need to be vaccinated.

16:14.457 --> 16:15.622
For the flu, hepatitis...

16:15.624 --> 16:18.718
Hepatitis, shingles,
polio, pneumonia,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.703
COVID, diphtheria,
pertussis, yada yada.

16:20.705 --> 16:23.889
AUSTIN:
After a transplant,
the meds we give you

16:23.891 --> 16:25.466
to keep you from rejecting
your new lungs

16:25.468 --> 16:28.060
also make it hard for your body
to fight off infections.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.487
DEVON:
Leaving you vulnerable

16:29.489 --> 16:31.138
to any number of things
that could destroy

16:31.140 --> 16:33.157
the precious lungs we give you.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.643
These are my risks
to reject or accept.

16:36.645 --> 16:37.903
I will take my chances.

16:37.905 --> 16:39.998
AUSTIN:
You can hold on
to your position,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.724
but the cost
is we can't list you.

16:41.726 --> 16:42.983
DEVON:
Transplant programs

16:42.985 --> 16:44.393
simply can't give
an organ to someone

16:44.395 --> 16:45.819
who refuses
the necessary vaccines.

16:45.821 --> 16:48.673
Look, there's got to be an
exception for a guy like Jimmy.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.509
-No exceptions.
-DEVON: We can explain
the science, right?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.160
There is no reason
to fear vaccines.

16:53.162 --> 16:56.756
They are the single greatest
success story in medicine.

16:56.758 --> 16:59.851
Prevention beats any treatment
by light-years.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.577
Yeah, this is about
my principles.

17:01.579 --> 17:03.187
AUSTIN:
Really? Is it
about your principles

17:03.189 --> 17:05.339
or is it about
remaining a hot topic?

17:05.341 --> 17:06.932
Hey, don't talk
like that to Jimmy.

17:06.934 --> 17:08.601
DEVON:
We're not forcing him
to do anything,

17:08.603 --> 17:10.603
but the bottom line is
you don't get a rare resource

17:10.605 --> 17:13.197
like new lungs
if you're not vaccinated.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.200
The risk of infection and death
are too high.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.427
Donated organs cannot
be wasted on patients

17:18.429 --> 17:20.538
-who will not live
to enjoy them.
-JIMMY: Hey.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.266
My mind is made up.

17:23.268 --> 17:26.627
I will never get vaccinated.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.055
I came as quickly as I could.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.115
OR 1.
Cade's already on the table.

17:39.117 --> 17:41.450
Bell needs
an extra set of hands.

17:41.452 --> 17:42.894
Look, I know this is not the
right time, but I'm guessing

17:42.896 --> 17:44.729
you heard about me
and Devon and I just,

17:44.731 --> 17:47.306
-I hope you're not angry.
-I'm not angry, I'm stressed.

17:47.308 --> 17:49.216
-We all are.
-It's not something I wanted.

17:49.218 --> 17:52.128
Leela, it's your business.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.297
And right now,
I'm focused on Cade.

17:54.299 --> 17:57.200
Of course.
That's where my focus is, too.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.487
Sorry for the delay.
I couldn't believe when I heard.

18:01.489 --> 18:04.307
BELL:
Well, she has lost
a lot of blood already,

18:04.309 --> 18:05.641
we have none to transfuse

18:05.643 --> 18:07.643
and when we open,
she will bleed more.

18:07.645 --> 18:11.071
Of course, we would
all prefer that Dr. Sullivan

18:11.073 --> 18:12.507
not bleed to death
on this table.

18:13.818 --> 18:18.221
So our goal is to keep
blood loss to a minimum.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.226
We have no reserve.

18:26.088 --> 18:28.106
All right, then.
10 blade to me.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.262
LEELA:
Damn it. No.

18:35.264 --> 18:37.740
(monitor beeping rapidly)

18:39.360 --> 18:41.619
BELL:
Dr. Devi, uh, take your hand

18:41.621 --> 18:43.604
and plunge it toward her back
to find her spleen.

18:43.606 --> 18:46.624
When you take it out,
the bleeding will slow.

18:48.536 --> 18:51.796
LEELA:
I'm-I'm where her spleen
should be. I can't find it.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.132
-JESSICA: Dr. Bell, take over.
-BELL: It's o-it's okay.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.092
Take the retractor.

18:59.697 --> 19:01.197
I got it.

19:01.199 --> 19:02.598
Okay, now clamp it.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.629
This is personal for all of us.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.130
That's all the more reason
not to panic.

19:10.132 --> 19:12.483
You've got this.

19:14.061 --> 19:16.070
Now staple it off.

19:19.217 --> 19:21.567
-Good.
-LEELA: Okay, spleen's out.

19:21.569 --> 19:23.143
The bleeding is slowing.

19:23.145 --> 19:24.495
CHU:
But the pressure's
still dropping.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.406
She had multiple gunshot wounds.
Run the bowel.

19:27.408 --> 19:28.908
-There might be a perf.
-BELL: Already on that.

19:28.910 --> 19:30.367
LEELA:
I see one.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.628
BELL:
Okay, we'll cut out
the damaged bowel.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.921
CHU:
We're getting cold here.
She's hypothermic.

19:41.923 --> 19:43.906
BELL:
Okay, that's all we can do.
We're out of time.

19:43.908 --> 19:45.241
There's no time
to repair the bowel.

19:45.243 --> 19:47.426
So we'll staple it off
on both sides.

19:48.596 --> 19:50.521
LEELA:
We're going to leave her bowel
in discontinuity?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.598
BELL:
We will reconnect it
when we come back later.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.675
Jessica, give me
all the lap pads you've got.

19:54.677 --> 19:57.028
Let's jam them in there.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.658
We have to stop the bleeding.

20:11.436 --> 20:15.454
No, I said Rh null.
Okay, I understand.

20:15.456 --> 20:17.790
Call me back
if you find any matches.

20:17.792 --> 20:19.533
-How is she?
-(sighs) Out of surgery.

20:19.535 --> 20:22.220
Alive, but barely.
Where are we with the blood?

20:22.222 --> 20:23.870
I called up and down
the East Coast. Nothing.

20:23.872 --> 20:26.373
Rh null is one of the rarest
blood types in existence.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.951
And even if we find blood,
who knows how far away it'll be.

20:28.953 --> 20:30.302
Seattle.

20:30.304 --> 20:32.471
I just got off the phone
with Cade's emergency contact--

20:32.473 --> 20:35.291
her father--
he is a peds surgeon

20:35.293 --> 20:36.976
at Seattle Children's.

20:36.978 --> 20:37.977
He has the same blood type.

20:38.646 --> 20:41.130
-When can he get here?
-He's taking the red-eye,

20:41.132 --> 20:42.481
and he's gonna land at 6:50 a.m.

20:42.483 --> 20:44.149
That means
she'll be without blood

20:44.151 --> 20:46.059
for the next 16 hours at least?

20:46.061 --> 20:48.395
BILLIE:
Cade knew she had
a rare blood type.

20:48.397 --> 20:49.914
Wouldn't she have
banked some of it?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.323
Yeah, but not here. I checked.

20:51.325 --> 20:52.975
BILLIE:
She wasn't planning

20:52.977 --> 20:54.252
on staying here long.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.995
Where's the last place
she worked?

20:55.997 --> 20:58.130
Atlanta General.

21:02.987 --> 21:04.320
How is she?

21:04.322 --> 21:06.171
LEELA:
(sighs) We managed a splenectomy

21:06.173 --> 21:07.840
and removed the perfed section
of the bowel,

21:07.842 --> 21:10.935
but she's lost too much blood
to do a definitive operation.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.162
So until then, her bowel
has to be disconnected.

21:13.164 --> 21:14.997
Her abdomen has to remain open.

21:14.999 --> 21:17.525
DEVON:
We're doing our best
to find blood.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.766
We have to figure out a way
to work in the same hospital.

21:25.768 --> 21:28.935
It's been less than 24 hours.

21:28.937 --> 21:30.288
It's gonna be hard,

21:30.290 --> 21:32.999
but we just have to stay focused
on being civil.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.544
I know we can do that.

21:47.532 --> 21:49.623
-How's she doing?
-She's a bloody mess.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.143
-They find the shooter?
-The FBI is still looking.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.960
Has your phone
been ringing off the hook?

21:53.962 --> 21:55.204
I'm trying to head that off.

21:55.206 --> 21:57.732
I have a press conference
in 20 minutes.

22:00.061 --> 22:02.394
I am so glad you were here

22:02.396 --> 22:04.488
to be the one
to handle Cade's surgery.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.616
Bullet wounds, FBI,
a doctor shot in the street?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.143
Life is fragile.

22:10.145 --> 22:13.622
-I'm so grateful for you.
-Oh, me too.

22:17.562 --> 22:20.654
You know, poor Cade. As far
as I can tell, she's got no one.

22:20.656 --> 22:23.341
Conrad's there for her.

22:24.159 --> 22:26.469
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:31.017 --> 22:34.000
-I can handle this.
-Well, we'll handle it together.

22:34.002 --> 22:36.428
All I'm saying
is I can run point

22:36.430 --> 22:38.764
if you want me to.

22:38.766 --> 22:40.524
I know this is nothing like Nic,

22:40.526 --> 22:42.267
but she is a friend
and a colleague

22:42.269 --> 22:43.936
that we want to save.

22:43.938 --> 22:46.530
-The situation's
got to be a trigger.
-No.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.515
Not even close.

22:48.517 --> 22:50.259
We can save Cade.

22:50.261 --> 22:52.444
-Okay. How?
-Billie was right.

22:52.446 --> 22:54.688
Cade did bank her own blood.
She moved it

22:54.690 --> 22:57.116
with her every time
she switched cities. There are

22:57.118 --> 22:59.359
two units at Atlanta General.
They're on the way now.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.286
Great news. Did you tell Bell

23:01.288 --> 23:03.105
to get the OR ready
for when it gets here?

23:03.107 --> 23:04.698
On my way to do it.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.626
All right. I'll stay here
and keep an eye on her vitals.

23:07.628 --> 23:11.296
Great. Remember, we have
to watch her drainage, too.

23:11.298 --> 23:12.873
Tells us what's going on
in her abdomen.

23:12.875 --> 23:16.394
-If it starts filling up
with blood...
-I know all this.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.689
I got it.

23:31.485 --> 23:32.910
The lockdown of Chastain's ER

23:32.912 --> 23:36.305
created tremendous stress
on the Atlanta hospital system.

23:36.307 --> 23:38.565
I'm relieved to say
that we are now open.

23:38.567 --> 23:41.660
But our ER doctor who was shot
is in critical condition.

23:41.662 --> 23:44.480
Dr. Voss, since you're refusing
to save Jimmy Miller's life,

23:44.482 --> 23:46.665
would you consider transferring
him to another hospital?

23:46.667 --> 23:48.241
-Jimmy Miller? I...
-REPORTER: What if someone

23:48.243 --> 23:49.427
made a directed donation?

23:49.429 --> 23:50.761
REPORTER 2:
How does Chastain respond

23:50.763 --> 23:52.930
to the accusation
that you are punishing Miller

23:52.932 --> 23:54.432
for being anti-vax?

23:54.434 --> 23:56.825
Are you denying a patient
life-saving organs

23:56.827 --> 23:58.510
-because you don't like
his politics?
-REPORTER 3: Are you?

23:58.512 --> 23:59.662
(reporters clamoring)

23:59.664 --> 24:02.255
I'm here to discuss
an act of violence

24:02.257 --> 24:04.275
against
a health care professional,

24:04.277 --> 24:06.259
not Chastain's policy,
which is consistent

24:06.261 --> 24:08.112
with policy
throughout the country,

24:08.114 --> 24:11.598
requiring vaccination
for transplant listing.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.433
-Is this a UNOS requirement?
-REPORTER: Jimmy Miller is

24:13.435 --> 24:16.436
the father of a young child.
Would you let him die?

24:16.438 --> 24:18.998
(reporters clamoring)

24:22.462 --> 24:25.296
-Who the hell is Jimmy Miller?
-He's a podcast host followed

24:25.298 --> 24:27.280
-by millions.
-Who apparently

24:27.282 --> 24:28.299
has been podcasting
from his room,

24:28.301 --> 24:29.708
painting himself as the victim

24:29.710 --> 24:31.527
of the deep state's
vaccine requirements

24:31.529 --> 24:32.544
for transplantation.

24:32.546 --> 24:35.030
He needs new lungs,
but he's anti-vax.

24:35.032 --> 24:36.640
Since we can't list him here
for a transplant,

24:36.642 --> 24:38.717
-I'd like to transfer him
someplace else.
-AUSTIN: Well,

24:38.719 --> 24:40.311
I called Atlanta General.
And, as with most hospitals,

24:40.313 --> 24:42.128
their rules
are the same as ours.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.223
What a circus.
On a day when we don't need

24:44.225 --> 24:45.557
any more chaos.
Look at this.

24:45.559 --> 24:47.226
<i> JIMMY:</i>

24:47.228 --> 24:48.560

24:52.066 --> 24:54.641
<i> Why? Because I won't</i>

24:54.643 --> 24:56.660

24:56.662 --> 24:58.570
<i> They say that</i>

<i> (coughing continues)</i>

25:13.161 --> 25:15.237
I can't breathe.

25:15.239 --> 25:18.349
He had a coughing fit
and couldn't recover.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.975
(Jimmy gasping)

25:21.412 --> 25:23.670
He needs a stat
portable chest X-ray. Call RT

25:23.672 --> 25:24.838
and get him on a noninvasive.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.190
And give him 40 of furosemide.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.267
Drying him out
a little bit won't hurt.

25:28.269 --> 25:29.585
Help him!

25:29.587 --> 25:31.253
Just wait outside the room.
We will update you

25:31.255 --> 25:34.323
as soon as we
get things settled, all right?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.159
I love you.

25:44.268 --> 25:45.709
All right, Jimmy.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.527
-Just take some deep breaths.
-AUSTIN: And this is

25:47.529 --> 25:48.695
gonna do some of the work
for you.

25:48.697 --> 25:50.130
It's gonna help you breathe.

25:50.958 --> 25:52.299
I lied before.

25:53.127 --> 25:54.552
Get me lungs.

25:55.129 --> 25:57.179
I'm vaccinated.

26:01.285 --> 26:03.561
Cade's banked blood is here.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.563
Just in time.

26:07.215 --> 26:08.566
There's one unit
in each of these.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.568
Help me open them up. Quick.

26:11.462 --> 26:13.279
-(grunts)
-They're frozen shut.

26:15.766 --> 26:17.132
Cade must have banked them

26:17.134 --> 26:18.701
a long time ago.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.289
Got it.

26:27.328 --> 26:29.753
All right.
Now let's warm 'em up.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.184
(beeping)

26:45.605 --> 26:47.688
The bags are leaking.

26:53.428 --> 26:55.279
We were careful.
How did that happen?

26:55.281 --> 26:58.741
Plastic must have cracked
when it thawed.

27:02.029 --> 27:03.269
Blood was frozen too long,

27:03.271 --> 27:05.122
and now all of it
is contaminated.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.499
Are we out of options?

27:09.069 --> 27:12.755
Both units lost? Okay,
just let me know what I can do.

27:13.782 --> 27:14.965
-He was lying.
-KIT: Who?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.859
Jimmy Miller. Podcast host.

27:16.861 --> 27:18.618
He's fully vaccinated.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.529
He blurted it out
when he couldn't breathe

27:20.531 --> 27:22.455
and felt what it's like
to be dying.

27:22.457 --> 27:24.867
Which means he technically
meets our transplant criteria.

27:24.869 --> 27:26.368
I even have
his vaccination records.

27:26.370 --> 27:27.978
That was his only barrier.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.313
We need to list him.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.540
We cure saints and sinners both.
Given the choice,

27:31.542 --> 27:32.983
we err on the side
of second chances.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.394
Yeah, but since we can't
reveal to anyone

27:35.396 --> 27:37.655
that he's vaccinated,
even his wife...

27:37.657 --> 27:38.897
The public is going to think

27:38.899 --> 27:40.491
that we're violating
our own rules.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.993
It doesn't change the fact
that he's now in compliance

27:42.995 --> 27:44.811
with our requirements.

27:44.813 --> 27:46.146
I'll deal
with the fallout later.

27:46.148 --> 27:47.998
We have far bigger problems.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.950
Cade's banked blood is unusable.

27:49.952 --> 27:52.836
-Oh, no.
-KIT: And the Red Cross
is coming up empty-handed.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.730
They're broadening their search,

27:54.732 --> 27:57.007
but we all know
how long that takes.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.736
What if we don't
give her blood at all?

28:00.738 --> 28:02.012
<i> KIT:</i>
<i> Devon is proposing</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:03.514
we use Hemoglobin 2.0.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.741
Yes. It is a blood substitute
synthesized

28:05.743 --> 28:07.926
from cow hemoglobin
that can carry oxygen

28:07.928 --> 28:10.187
-all around the body.
-BELL: Yeah,
I'm familiar with it.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.430
Supposed to save soldiers
in combat

28:11.432 --> 28:12.931
who didn't have access
to transfusion.

28:12.933 --> 28:14.391
-Key words, "supposed to."
-BELL: Yeah,

28:14.393 --> 28:15.859
exactly. I mean,
blood substitutes can be toxic.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.253
Kidney damage,
heart failure, death.

28:18.255 --> 28:19.363
And they're not approved
by the FDA.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.366
I'm not crazy about the idea,

28:22.368 --> 28:24.184
but Cade will die
if we don't do something.

28:24.186 --> 28:25.928
The anecdotal evidence
is promising.

28:25.930 --> 28:29.189
The Cleveland Clinic recently
used a similar blood substitute

28:29.191 --> 28:31.691
on a patient
with hemorrhagic shock.

28:31.693 --> 28:33.210
Saved her life.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.120
I can connect you
with the head of the company.

28:35.122 --> 28:37.864
-We're gonna need the FDA to get
us expanded access and fast.
-(tablet chimes)

28:37.866 --> 28:40.459
Slow down. Let's just take
a beat and talk this out,

28:40.461 --> 28:41.944
'cause the risks
are considerable.

28:41.946 --> 28:43.628
Her lactate's climbing to five.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.464
Crit is still falling,
and creatinine's up

28:45.466 --> 28:47.966
to two. I mean, what are we
waiting for, for her to code?

28:47.968 --> 28:49.451
Well, let's say
we give it to her

28:49.453 --> 28:51.787
and she dies
and the Red Cross comes through

28:51.789 --> 28:53.956
moments later
or her father arrives in time

28:53.958 --> 28:55.441
-to give blood.
-CONRAD: Every moment

28:55.443 --> 28:57.125
with a blood count this low
is another moment

28:57.127 --> 28:59.962
her organs aren't perfused.
Brain included.

28:59.964 --> 29:00.963
I'm with Conrad.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.130
It's a temporary solution,

29:02.132 --> 29:04.224
but we can't
just sit on our hands and wait.

29:04.226 --> 29:05.968
KIT:
All right.

29:05.970 --> 29:07.745
Let's get the process started.

29:09.898 --> 29:11.707
Okay.

29:18.573 --> 29:19.831
(knocking)

29:19.833 --> 29:20.924
Hey.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.167
What's the good word?

29:22.169 --> 29:24.077
We're gonna list you for lungs.

29:24.079 --> 29:25.429
Oh! Thank you, doctors.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.672
Jimmy, you were right.
They changed their minds.

29:27.674 --> 29:31.660
-Our policy hasn't changed.
-We only list patients
for transplant

29:31.662 --> 29:33.161
if they've been vaccinated.

29:33.163 --> 29:34.846
But you made an exception.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.756
Of course
they made an exception.

29:36.758 --> 29:39.151
-They felt
the public pressure and...
-AUSTIN: No exceptions.

29:40.428 --> 29:41.928
LOLA:
But if you didn't change
your policy

29:41.930 --> 29:44.448
or make an exception, then...

29:46.434 --> 29:49.845
(chuckles) Are you-are you
saying Jimmy's vaccinated?

29:49.847 --> 29:52.014
-We did not say that.
-HIPAA privacy rules

29:52.016 --> 29:53.198
prohibit the release

29:53.200 --> 29:54.607
of protected
health care information

29:54.609 --> 29:56.627
without consent.

30:02.026 --> 30:04.617
-Oh, my God.
-Uh, Lola, take it easy.

30:04.619 --> 30:06.528
I knew you lied
about a lot of things.

30:06.530 --> 30:09.381
It's like a game to you.
But you lied to other people,

30:09.383 --> 30:12.226
not to me.
At least, that's what I thought.

30:13.128 --> 30:16.129
Tell me the truth right now.

30:16.131 --> 30:19.107
Have you been vaccinated
all along?

30:23.564 --> 30:26.064
Jimmy Jr. got the measles

30:26.066 --> 30:27.215
because of you!

30:27.217 --> 30:30.160
No shots for your own son?

30:30.162 --> 30:33.313
He nearly died because
it turned into pneumonia.

30:33.315 --> 30:35.481
And I had a blood clot
from COVID,

30:35.483 --> 30:36.983
and I was in the hospital
for weeks,

30:36.985 --> 30:38.743
and you were vaccinated
the whole time,

30:38.745 --> 30:40.504
you son of a bitch!

30:41.732 --> 30:43.231
HIPPA doesn't apply to me.

30:43.233 --> 30:45.567
So the whole world will now know

30:45.569 --> 30:47.261
what a liar you are.

30:48.072 --> 30:49.237
Lawyer up.

30:49.239 --> 30:51.306
I'm divorcing you.

31:03.770 --> 31:07.422
Bet it'll be extra sore
with this many jabs.

31:07.424 --> 31:09.867
One vaccine down, five to go.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.184
Well, you're making
the right choice.

31:11.186 --> 31:12.928
Oh, I regret
I didn't make it sooner.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.930
At least
I can do my part to help.

31:14.932 --> 31:16.932
Stop some of the damage
he caused.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.543
"Vaccines: guess who got them?

31:19.545 --> 31:22.270
-Begins with 'J'
and ends with 'immy.'"
-(Lola chuckles)

31:22.272 --> 31:25.031
Plenty more to come.
I'm gonna get back at that man

31:25.033 --> 31:27.533
using the only language
he cares about.

31:27.535 --> 31:29.628
All right, hit me again.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.538
-CROWE: Dr. Conrad Hawkins?
-Yeah.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.540
I got your HB 2.0.
Just need to see your ID.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.635
Thank you
for getting here so quickly.

31:36.637 --> 31:39.396
You caught a break.
I was at Emory today.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.047
You're a first-time user, yes?

31:41.049 --> 31:42.733
Yeah, but I've read up on it.
Start slow.

31:42.884 --> 31:46.069
-Monitor her heart rate,
blood pressure.
-Pressure will shoot up quick.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.887
You don't want her
to stroke out.

31:47.889 --> 31:50.465
Once you give it, your lab
may refuse to run the samples.

31:50.467 --> 31:53.318
They'll say they're hemolyzed.
Tell them to do it anyway.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.728
Uh, ignore the crit.
Trust your hemoglobin.

31:55.730 --> 31:57.897
Don't look at her sat, either.
That's gonna drop.

31:57.899 --> 31:59.065
It's not real.

31:59.067 --> 32:00.475
Get a blood gas.

32:00.477 --> 32:02.419
-Text me with any questions.
-All right, will do.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.756
And, uh, don't forget to snap
a photo when she's better.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.983
I collect them.

32:07.985 --> 32:09.593
Thank you.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.911
-(alarms blaring)
-BELL: She's maxed out

32:11.913 --> 32:13.838
on norepinephrine
and vasopressin.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.990
I'll hang an epi drip.

32:14.992 --> 32:16.433
BELL:
All the pressors in the world

32:16.435 --> 32:17.993
aren't gonna do anything
if she hasn't got any blood.

32:17.995 --> 32:19.161
I'm gonna hang
another bolus of albumin.

32:19.163 --> 32:21.939
Maybe buy us some time.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.999
It's here.

32:24.001 --> 32:26.092
All right.

32:26.094 --> 32:28.654
Time to make a miracle, gents.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.992
All right.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.868
BELL:
Damn it.

32:43.870 --> 32:45.187
Her sats are dropping.

32:45.189 --> 32:46.612
It's not a real reading.

32:46.614 --> 32:49.858
The HB 2.0 interferes
with the probe's ability

32:49.860 --> 32:51.693
to measure her oxygen level.

32:51.695 --> 32:53.044
She's okay.

32:53.046 --> 32:54.972
Just wait.

33:01.129 --> 33:02.479
That's the best pressure
we've seen

33:02.481 --> 33:04.130
-all day.
-Okay, this is her window.

33:04.132 --> 33:06.733
I'll get the team
to meet me in the OR.

33:18.889 --> 33:21.581
They've got her, Conrad.

33:22.893 --> 33:24.626
I hope so.

33:28.323 --> 33:30.540
What are you most worried about?

33:31.251 --> 33:33.068
CONRAD:
That I decided on the HB 2.0

33:33.070 --> 33:34.511
too soon and she'll have
some complication.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.264
You didn't have any other
choice. We both know that.

33:38.666 --> 33:41.226
I'm very worried about Cade.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.003
(sighs)

33:44.005 --> 33:45.413
But I'm also worried about you.

33:45.415 --> 33:47.840
Devon already covered
that territory.

33:47.842 --> 33:50.085
I'm okay.

33:50.087 --> 33:52.029
Are you really?

33:53.257 --> 33:55.774
I think the question
everyone's thinking

33:55.776 --> 33:58.243
and no one is saying is...

33:59.112 --> 34:01.538
How personal is this, Conrad?

34:01.540 --> 34:05.333
-It's personal for all of us.
-That's not what I'm asking.

34:08.363 --> 34:10.338
Are you in love with Cade?

34:12.885 --> 34:15.135
No.

34:15.796 --> 34:17.679
Are you sure?

34:20.284 --> 34:22.100
No.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.520
What do you mean?

34:28.141 --> 34:30.716
She knew she had to leave,

34:30.718 --> 34:33.737
so we didn't go there.

34:35.056 --> 34:36.907
She put up barriers
to protect herself.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.700
So did I.

34:40.637 --> 34:43.729
What are your barriers?

34:43.731 --> 34:46.399
Ah, it's obvious.

34:46.401 --> 34:49.661
It always comes back to Nic.

34:49.663 --> 34:52.997
Something stops me,
and it's not just with Cade.

34:52.999 --> 34:55.575
It's with...

34:55.577 --> 34:59.513
It's with others, too.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.492
What stops you?

35:04.494 --> 35:06.919
I'm not sure.

35:06.921 --> 35:09.648
Am I protecting myself, maybe?

35:12.686 --> 35:15.019
'Cause I can't face
another loss like that.

35:15.021 --> 35:16.929
And-and...

35:16.931 --> 35:18.764
do I feel like
I'm cheating on Nic?

35:18.766 --> 35:20.659
I don't know. Um...

35:23.347 --> 35:25.697
All I know
is that whatever I feel

35:25.699 --> 35:27.666
only goes so far.

35:30.687 --> 35:32.379
And then the walls come up.

35:36.193 --> 35:39.010
Maybe you just need
a little push.

35:45.126 --> 35:46.626
How's it going?

35:47.479 --> 35:50.054
BILLIE:
(sighs) They're prepping her
as carefully

35:50.056 --> 35:51.706
as they can.

35:51.708 --> 35:54.025
But I think they're ready now.

35:58.231 --> 36:01.566
Those laps pads are all
that's staunching the bleeding.

36:01.568 --> 36:03.994
Pulling them out
could unleash a torrent.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.038
If it does, her survival
depends on that team.

36:09.984 --> 36:11.484
BELL:
Okay, on three.

36:11.486 --> 36:14.963
-AUSTIN: Let's do it.
-BELL: One, two, three.

36:17.417 --> 36:18.341
(alarm blaring)

36:18.343 --> 36:19.734
AUSTIN:
I need suction in here.

36:19.736 --> 36:20.993
BELL:
2-0 stick tie to me now.

36:20.995 --> 36:24.097
LEELA:
Stitch. Suction. More suction.

36:25.833 --> 36:28.018
AUSTIN:
All right, bleeding is coming
from the lesser sac.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.521
LEELA:
I need better retraction.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.856
CHU:
Our pressure isn't pretty, team.

36:32.858 --> 36:33.932
I'm giving
more blood substitute.

36:34.100 --> 36:35.750
BELL:
Damn it, the bowel's
more injured

36:35.752 --> 36:36.193
than anticipated.
I'm gonna try and save it.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.752
Stapler.

36:38.255 --> 36:40.030
-AUSTIN: We got a bleeder
at the head of the pancreas.
-LEELA: And at the stump

36:40.032 --> 36:41.272
of the splenic artery.
I need to tie it off.

36:41.274 --> 36:42.607
AUSTIN:
I'm dangerously close

36:42.609 --> 36:43.942
to the SMA. More suction.

36:43.944 --> 36:45.493
Come on, I need help here.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.261
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:08.785 --> 37:10.393
(footsteps approaching)

37:10.395 --> 37:12.954
She made it through the night?

37:12.956 --> 37:15.023
Yeah.

37:17.218 --> 37:19.051
LEELA:
Do you think she'll live?

37:19.053 --> 37:20.904
I don't know.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.465
But if she does,

37:23.467 --> 37:24.482
the question is

37:24.634 --> 37:27.318
is she gonna have
permanent brain damage?

37:28.580 --> 37:32.040
We're going to extubate her now.
We're gonna know more soon.

37:33.568 --> 37:35.585
I want to be hopeful,

37:35.587 --> 37:38.421
but she lost so much blood.

37:40.667 --> 37:44.986
That's a sickening thought,
given how Nic died.

37:44.988 --> 37:46.096
DEVON:
It's like he wants to

37:46.265 --> 37:49.724
relive what happened to Nic
and rewrite the ending.

37:52.846 --> 37:55.647
I wish we could rewrite
our ending.

38:04.007 --> 38:06.533
I never saw it coming.

38:11.623 --> 38:16.184
I want us to find ground
we can stand on somehow

38:16.186 --> 38:18.461
so we can work together.

38:21.449 --> 38:24.283
I can't imagine that right now.

38:24.285 --> 38:26.094
I guess we're both...

38:27.881 --> 38:29.639
...hurting.

38:43.046 --> 38:46.639
"Liar, liar,
super-vaxxed pants on fire."

38:46.641 --> 38:49.400
"How many people died
because he lied?"

38:49.402 --> 38:52.144
-(chuckles)
It's a temporary reaction.
-Yeah,

38:52.146 --> 38:56.057
well, dishonesty
is a self-inflicted wound.

38:56.059 --> 38:58.726
Sure, it brought you fame,
but the truth always comes out,

38:58.728 --> 39:01.396
and now you have to deal
with the reactions.

39:01.398 --> 39:03.414
They're talking about me.

39:03.416 --> 39:05.157
There's no such thing
as bad press.

39:05.159 --> 39:06.158
And I know
how to deal with this.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.677
They need a new villain.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.012
Lola will fill that bill.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.014
Ah, let me guess.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.074
Because she went public online

39:13.076 --> 39:14.926
and called you out
as vaccinated,

39:14.928 --> 39:17.354
-you're going to say
she's lying.
-You know how many people

39:17.356 --> 39:20.172
who say they're anti-vax
are really vaccinated?

39:20.174 --> 39:22.007
Do they all lie to their wives?

39:22.009 --> 39:23.585
I didn't lie to her.

39:23.587 --> 39:25.770
She's the liar, looking
for a big divorce settlement.

39:25.772 --> 39:27.555
Hell, she cheated on me.

39:27.557 --> 39:29.181
And that's what
you're gonna tell your audience.

39:29.183 --> 39:31.759
Yeah. And they'll believe me.

39:31.761 --> 39:33.036
Because they want to.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.262
Look, nobody cares anymore

39:34.447 --> 39:36.706
if you lie. They're happy
to believe pure fiction.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.765
Well,

39:37.767 --> 39:39.692
good doctors care, Mr. Miller.

39:39.694 --> 39:43.863
If we didn't, our patients
would die. Including you.

39:43.865 --> 39:46.274
There would be no such thing
as organ transplants.

39:46.276 --> 39:47.384
Blah, blah, blah.

39:47.386 --> 39:50.035
All you doctors want to do
is bully people.

39:50.037 --> 39:51.112
Do you always resort

39:51.297 --> 39:52.964
to personal attacks
when you lose an argument?

39:52.966 --> 39:55.374
You bet I do. Because it works.

39:55.376 --> 39:57.060
Well, I'm not here
to debate you.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.228
I have other patients
to tend to.

39:58.379 --> 40:00.805
I'm just here to let you know
that you cannot

40:00.807 --> 40:03.566
have a transplant at Chastain.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.461
Vaccines are not the only thing
you need to be listed.

40:06.463 --> 40:07.962
You also have to have someone

40:07.964 --> 40:09.464
who's willing to be
your caregiver

40:09.466 --> 40:12.391
for a year after the transplant.

40:12.393 --> 40:16.228
That would have been your wife.

40:16.230 --> 40:17.639
Well, I'll find someone else.

40:17.641 --> 40:20.992
Well, the thing is
it can't be someone you pay.

40:20.994 --> 40:22.810
That's what the rules say.

40:22.812 --> 40:26.071
It has to be someone
who actually cares about you.

40:26.073 --> 40:28.483
You think I don't have that?

40:28.485 --> 40:30.593
You tell me.

40:31.838 --> 40:33.488
(chuckles)

40:33.490 --> 40:35.080
You know what?
I am done with you.

40:35.082 --> 40:37.133
I'm gonna get myself
to another hospital.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.919
Yeah. Good luck with that,
Mr. Miller.

40:39.921 --> 40:42.147
Yeah. Mm.

40:50.765 --> 40:53.158
(monitor beeping steadily)

41:05.464 --> 41:07.672
Hey, partner.

41:15.307 --> 41:19.517
I can't tell you how happy I am
to hear those two words.

41:22.964 --> 41:26.191
You must have had some drama.

41:29.971 --> 41:32.137
Any pain?

41:32.139 --> 41:34.365
Not too much.

41:35.235 --> 41:37.885
I must be on some fine drugs.

41:37.887 --> 41:40.663
Well, I made sure of that.

41:49.749 --> 41:52.425
Thank you.

42:11.755 --> 42:14.197
It's good news.

42:22.690 --> 42:25.375
Your neuro exam is pristine,
Dr. Sullivan.

42:25.377 --> 42:27.210
And it makes me very happy
to say that.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.528
It'll be a long recovery,
but you're on your way.

42:29.530 --> 42:31.530
DEVON:
And we have more good news.

42:31.532 --> 42:33.791
More blood, your type,
just arrived downstairs.

42:33.793 --> 42:35.626
Your father's here.

42:35.628 --> 42:38.838
Just flew in from Seattle.
Came straight from the airport.
