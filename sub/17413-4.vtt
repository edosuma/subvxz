00:05.537 --> 00:07.905
- Ah!
- Home sweet home.

00:07.906 --> 00:11.871
Being on tour was amazing, but how
good does it feel to get off that bus?

00:11.872 --> 00:14.903
Surprise!

00:14.904 --> 00:17.809
- Welcome back!
- Thanks, dad.

00:17.810 --> 00:20.548
Uh, why does that sign
say "happy anniversary"?

00:20.549 --> 00:23.293
Oh, I found it in
the supply closet.

00:23.294 --> 00:27.529
Why spend money on new decorations
when it's the thought that counts?

00:27.530 --> 00:29.731
I guess that explains the
rotten jack-o'-lantern.

00:29.732 --> 00:31.565
Huh. Yeah.

00:31.566 --> 00:33.416
I missed you, Sweetie.

00:33.417 --> 00:36.334
Oh, I missed you too, Mr.
Dawson.

00:36.335 --> 00:38.334
I missed everything
in this place.

00:38.335 --> 00:41.328
I missed this cash register.
I missed this trumpet.

00:41.329 --> 00:44.340
I missed this random customer.

00:44.341 --> 00:45.407
You're back!

00:45.408 --> 00:47.261
Oh, it's so good to see you.

00:47.262 --> 00:49.422
You too.

00:50.677 --> 00:53.956
Put your arms down, buddy.
You're embarrassing yourself.

00:53.957 --> 00:56.506
Thanks so much for covering
for me while I was gone.

00:56.507 --> 00:59.374
Oh, sure, no problem. Working
with your dad was a blast.

00:59.375 --> 01:03.515
Oh. Well, thank you, Kira.

01:04.278 --> 01:08.281
Honestly... this was the
longest month of my life.

01:08.282 --> 01:10.707
Anyway, we have so
much to catch up on!

01:10.708 --> 01:12.985
Yeah, you wanna hear
all about my tour?

01:12.986 --> 01:16.087
I was talking to Ally.

01:16.088 --> 01:19.223
Okay, now you're starting
to embarrass me.

01:19.224 --> 01:20.707
Did you get all my postcards?

01:20.708 --> 01:22.719
Whoa. Since when are
you two a thing?

01:22.720 --> 01:25.904
Oh, we hung out a little before
I met up with you guys on tour.

01:25.905 --> 01:28.097
Turns out we have
a lot in common.

01:28.098 --> 01:30.758
I can think of one thing
you have in common.

01:30.759 --> 01:32.691
I'm talking about you, Austin.

01:32.692 --> 01:36.237
- Because you dated both Ally and K...
- I get it.

01:36.238 --> 01:38.818
Oh, hey, you guys wanna go to
the new beach club tomorrow?

01:38.819 --> 01:40.749
It's where the old Humpy's
Burger Bar used to be.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.108
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet!

01:42.109 --> 01:44.682
I could use a new hang. I'm
sick of this place already.

01:44.683 --> 01:47.211
I'm sick of this cash register.
I'm sick of that trumpet.

01:47.212 --> 01:49.213
I'm sick of this customer.

01:49.214 --> 01:51.909

just not there anymore.

03:00.773 --> 03:03.823
Yup, there's something
for everybody.

03:03.824 --> 03:06.915
Not to mention all
those fine honeys.

03:06.916 --> 03:10.391
Figures. I bring you to a beautiful beach
club and all you notice are the girls?

03:10.392 --> 03:12.222
Girls? I was talking
about the fine selection

03:12.223 --> 03:14.258
of honeys they have over
at the iced tea bar.

03:14.259 --> 03:16.359
Mm-mmm!

03:17.024 --> 03:18.448
Where did Trish go?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.880
- She'd love all this stuff.
- Hmm.

03:21.881 --> 03:25.255
Guess who got a job at
Shredders Beach Club!

03:25.256 --> 03:27.458
Really? We've been
here for two minutes.

03:27.459 --> 03:29.259
How did you get a job that fast?

03:29.260 --> 03:31.461
It's kinda my thing.

03:31.462 --> 03:34.397
You should see how
fast she loses jobs.

03:34.398 --> 03:36.713
Plus, Ally, did you
see that stage?

03:36.714 --> 03:39.203
Now that I work here, I'm
gonna try to book you a gig.

03:39.204 --> 03:40.842
That's a great idea!

03:40.843 --> 03:43.772
The grand opening party is Saturday night.
Maybe I can play that.

03:43.773 --> 03:46.177
Oh, totally. And it's
gonna be a luau.

03:46.178 --> 03:47.836
I love luaus...

03:47.837 --> 03:50.181

food, the clothes.

03:50.182 --> 03:53.374
Did you know tropical print is my
favorite after cheetah and leopard?

03:53.375 --> 03:55.186
Yes, I've seen your closet.

03:55.187 --> 03:57.884
Looks like a zoo
exploded in there.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.294
Let's hit the beach, Dez.

04:04.295 --> 04:06.872
This six-pack needs some sun.

04:06.873 --> 04:08.065
Yup.

04:08.066 --> 04:13.046
I got a one-pack that
could use some sun too.

04:13.271 --> 04:16.514
So, Ally, you never told
me what happened on tour.

04:16.515 --> 04:18.242
What's going on with
you and Austin?

04:18.243 --> 04:22.896
We had fun hanging out, but with
everything going on with our music...

04:22.897 --> 04:25.249
We thought it was best to just
stay friends for right now.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.285
I get it. You're focused
on your career.

04:27.286 --> 04:28.686
I'm focused on mine.

04:28.687 --> 04:30.876
Welcome to Shredders!

04:30.877 --> 04:33.125
I'm Hazel, the manager.

04:33.126 --> 04:36.889
Is there anything I can do to
make you guests more comfortable?

04:36.890 --> 04:38.430
Aren't you sweet!

04:38.431 --> 04:42.426
- Maybe some water.
- Oh! I don't mean you, silly.

04:42.427 --> 04:46.957
You work here. Oh! Here
is your official sponge.

04:46.958 --> 04:50.709
I'm sure you can find
something to wipe.

04:50.710 --> 04:53.560
Just that smile off her face.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.315
Sorry, Ally, looks like we can't
hang today like we planned.

04:56.316 --> 04:59.831
- That's okay. I've got Kira.
- Hmm.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.967
- Oh, wait, Trish.
- I know, I know.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.832
I want to hang with
you guys, too.

05:03.833 --> 05:06.878
No, I was wondering if you could
set up some beach chairs for us.

05:06.879 --> 05:10.479
Oh. I'll get right on that.

05:12.232 --> 05:15.167
Um, hey, Kira. I
love your swimsuit.

05:15.168 --> 05:17.088

05:35.034 --> 05:36.502
It's not a castle.

05:36.503 --> 05:40.091
It's a Yorkshire country manor
with adjoining stables.

05:40.092 --> 05:44.039
Yeah, that... that
was my second guess.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.398
Man, I missed the beach
while we were on tour.

05:46.399 --> 05:48.447
Oh, me too.

05:48.448 --> 05:52.588
The sun, the sand,
the treasure map.

05:53.039 --> 05:54.571
Did you just say,
"treasure map"?

05:54.572 --> 05:57.474
Did I just say, "treasure map"?!

05:57.475 --> 05:59.395
Whoa.

06:00.744 --> 06:02.386
Austin, look...

06:02.387 --> 06:05.745
A giant palm tree, a black rock.

06:05.746 --> 06:08.386
This map is leading to treasure
right here on the beach.

06:08.387 --> 06:09.917
Come on.

06:09.918 --> 06:13.028
You don't really think there's treasure
buried at the beach club, do you?

06:13.029 --> 06:14.829
This wasn't always a beach club.

06:14.830 --> 06:17.823
Remember what Mrs. Daniels
said in history class?

06:17.824 --> 06:20.064
"Wake up, Austin.
You're snoring again"?

06:20.065 --> 06:21.660
I mean before that.

06:21.661 --> 06:23.739
She said that 400 years ago,

06:23.740 --> 06:27.136
Ponce De Leon docked his ships
full of gold along this coastline.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.044
And then pirate Gasparilla
stole the treasure

06:30.045 --> 06:32.275
and buried it under
this very sand.

06:32.276 --> 06:34.725
Really? And you
believe all that?

06:34.726 --> 06:38.113
Trust me, there's booty
all over this beach.

06:39.361 --> 06:42.181
You said, "booty".

06:43.453 --> 06:46.159
- Oh.
- Excuse me, coming through.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.123
Trish, you are never
gonna believe this.

06:48.124 --> 06:51.020
Ally and I are taking a friendship
quiz and getting all the same answers.

06:51.021 --> 06:53.535
Watch. "You're
planning a vacation".

06:53.536 --> 06:58.133
"Do you, A; Jet-set to Tahiti or,
B; Go ice-fishing in Minnesota?"

06:58.134 --> 07:00.294

07:12.082 --> 07:13.779
Easy... "A".

07:13.780 --> 07:15.550
Movies make the
best first dates.

You don't have to hear the
guy yapping about himself.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.155

I pick "B".

each other's...

07:33.704 --> 07:37.002
Oh! Kira, did I ever tell you about
the time Trish and I went to the...

07:37.003 --> 07:38.915
- Fair.
- Actually, I was gonna say the...

07:38.916 --> 07:41.409
- Water Park.
- Art museum.

07:41.410 --> 07:43.477
And then Trish fell asleep
during a lecture on...

07:43.478 --> 07:45.738
Oil paintings? Stenciling?

07:45.739 --> 07:48.800
- Renaissance architecture?
- Exactly!

07:48.801 --> 07:51.836
Wow! It's like you can
read my thoughts!

Hey, have you guys
seen Ally anywhere?

08:22.159 --> 08:24.118
I think she went
swimming with Kira.

08:24.119 --> 08:27.644
Oh. Those two sure are connected
at the hip today, huh?

08:27.645 --> 08:33.544
Being all cutesy, and B.F.F.-ey, and some
might even say unbearably obnoxious.

08:33.589 --> 08:35.865
I think it's a-dorable.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.889
Yeah, they're like... Twinsies.

"Twinsies" is going to get hurtsies.

Look, you're Ally's B.F.F. and
the one who books her gigs.

No one can replace you.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.482
Hey, guys!

08:58.483 --> 09:00.939
I just booked Ally a gig
here at the beach club!

09:02.490 --> 09:06.090
I guess you can be replaced.

I'm so excited I get to sing at the
beach club luau tomorrow night.

09:17.163 --> 09:19.771

get a regular gig there.

- Ow!

09:35.448 --> 09:38.554
Sorry! Catch you guys later.

Do not ask us what we're doing
with all this digging equipment.

09:41.703 --> 09:43.704

we know where to look.

out what to wear tomorrow.

kinda jealous lately.

10:16.671 --> 10:18.739
Well, maybe I am a

You're spending so much time
with Kira and I barely see you.

10:21.831 --> 10:24.077

Kira borrow your shoes?

11:00.291 --> 11:02.092
I'm exhausted.

11:02.093 --> 11:04.428
We've been digging for hours
and we haven't made a dent.

11:04.429 --> 11:07.164
Must be something wrong
with our shovels.

11:07.165 --> 11:10.716
Try the metal detector again.

11:14.717 --> 11:20.057
Great Gasparilla's ghost. I
think we found something!

11:21.111 --> 11:22.678
Yes!

11:22.679 --> 11:24.612
Another metal detector.

11:24.613 --> 11:26.473
Woo!

11:26.625 --> 11:31.485
Great! Now we can find
nothing twice as fast.

11:34.357 --> 11:37.359
Aloha, and welcome to
paradise by the sea.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.262
Your evening of Polynesian
enchantment awaits.

11:40.263 --> 11:42.230
Here's your complimentary lei.

11:42.231 --> 11:44.918
Please enjoy the
all-you-can-eat seafood bar.

11:44.919 --> 11:48.745
Question; Is that all I can eat
now or all I can eat ever?

11:48.746 --> 11:51.834
Because I brought a to-go bag.

11:51.835 --> 11:53.755
Okay.

11:54.311 --> 11:56.379
How's your stupid
treasure hunt going?

11:56.380 --> 11:59.248
Not good. I'm exhausted.

11:59.249 --> 12:03.052
It'll all be worth it when we get our
hands on that sweet sweet booty.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.421
There's gotta be a better
way to phrase that.

12:06.661 --> 12:08.224
And what's with your feet?

12:08.225 --> 12:10.927
Oh, these? Thanks for noticing.

12:10.928 --> 12:13.133
I've rigged metal detectors
to the bottom of our shoes

12:13.134 --> 12:16.925
so we can schmooze and treasure
hunt at the same time.

12:19.436 --> 12:21.399
<i>♪ Trish!</i>

12:21.400 --> 12:24.307
Great news...
you're on pig duty.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.143
Don't forget... the
first rule of the pork;

12:27.144 --> 12:31.704
If you want great
taste, you gotta baste.

12:33.150 --> 12:36.731
If I'm ever that
happy, just smack me.

12:36.732 --> 12:39.255
Oh! Aloha, welcome.

12:39.256 --> 12:41.842
- Complimentary lei?
- Aw, thanks, Trish.

12:41.843 --> 12:44.671
- Mmm.
- I'm gonna go grab a front-row seat.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.668
Break a leg.

12:46.669 --> 12:49.706
Hey, Trish, do you mind telling
the Stage Manager I'm here?

12:49.707 --> 12:52.198
Oh, are you sure you wouldn't
rather have your new B.F.F.,

12:52.199 --> 12:54.270
and manager, and
personal stylist do it?

12:54.271 --> 12:57.828
Trish, we talked about this. There's
no reason for you to be jealous.

12:57.829 --> 13:02.878
Well, I am. I am sick of the Twinsies stuff
and I'm sick of waiting on you guys.

13:02.879 --> 13:05.700
I have more dignity than that.

13:05.701 --> 13:11.601
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
a giant pig to keep moist.

13:14.392 --> 13:19.432
Dez! These stupid shoes
are picking up something!

13:23.101 --> 13:25.002
Oh, false alarm.

13:25.003 --> 13:28.363
It's just a shrimp fork.

13:35.347 --> 13:39.007
Stop! You're ruining my luau!

13:39.627 --> 13:43.321
Well, your luau is on the
site of some very valuable...

13:43.322 --> 13:44.600
Buried treasure.

13:44.601 --> 13:48.081
What are you talking about?

13:48.127 --> 13:49.710
Show her the map, Dez.

13:49.711 --> 13:52.197
Read it and weep.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.490
An authentic treasure map
from pirate Gasparilla.

13:55.491 --> 13:59.204
This is a children's menu
from Humpy's Burger Bar...

13:59.205 --> 14:01.143
The restaurant that
used to be here.

14:01.144 --> 14:05.044
I find these all over the place.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.866
What?!

14:07.867 --> 14:11.906
But how do you explain the bloodstain
and the giant "X" marking the treasure?

14:11.907 --> 14:17.807
That blood is ketchup and the "X" is
a half-finished tic-tac-toe game.

14:19.936 --> 14:22.954
Aloha, everybody.
I'm Ally Dawson.

14:22.955 --> 14:25.297
Welcome to Shredders'
grand opening!

14:25.298 --> 14:28.178
Woo!

14:28.201 --> 14:30.036
Let's get this luau started.

14:31.652 --> 14:33.372
Whoa, Trish!

14:33.373 --> 14:35.041
Second rule of pork;

14:35.042 --> 14:40.622
If you don't want it to burn,
speed up the turn. Woo!

15:03.062 --> 15:06.105
Honey, are you okay?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.308
She's trying to say something.

15:08.309 --> 15:11.178
- Get this thing off me!
- Oh. We're on it.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.431
Ally, I'm so sorry!

15:20.432 --> 15:23.156
I can't believe you
ruined my performance!

15:23.157 --> 15:26.426
- You did this on purpose!
- What?! Why would I do that?

15:26.427 --> 15:30.847
You've been jealous this whole time and
now you're trying to get back at me!

15:30.848 --> 15:32.922
You're supposed to
be my best friend!

15:32.923 --> 15:35.201
I can't believe you'd
blame me for this!

15:35.202 --> 15:38.371
If you really think I'd stoop that low,
then maybe we're not best friends!

15:38.372 --> 15:41.732
Maybe we're not!

15:50.025 --> 15:52.961
Uh, why were all those
dogs chasing us?

15:52.962 --> 15:55.285
Maybe because I
smell like bacon?

15:56.391 --> 15:59.890
Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything,
but you do smell really good.

15:59.891 --> 16:01.871
Thanks?

16:01.872 --> 16:05.121
I can't believe Trish would humiliate
me in front of all those people.

16:06.107 --> 16:07.849
Maybe she didn't do it.

16:07.850 --> 16:11.753
Yeah, I'm sure that pig just
flew through the air by itself.

16:11.754 --> 16:14.489
You think? Because my
algebra teacher said

16:14.501 --> 16:17.248
she'd give me an "A"
if that ever happened.

16:17.249 --> 16:20.069
Sorry.

16:20.890 --> 16:22.891
I think you're wrong
about this one, Ally.

16:22.892 --> 16:24.926
Trish wouldn't do something
like that on purpose.

16:24.927 --> 16:28.229
Trust me, you haven't seen
the way she's been acting.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.576
But she's your best friend.

16:30.577 --> 16:36.477
I mean, sure, she can be mean, and
selfish, and heartless at times.

16:36.906 --> 16:40.341
- But...?
- Oh no, that... that's it.

16:40.342 --> 16:42.944
Ally, are you all right?

16:42.945 --> 16:47.225
Not really. I got in a fight with my
best friend and tackled by a flying pig.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.285
That was pretty funny. It's
actually trending on...

16:50.286 --> 16:53.132
- It's on the Internet?!
- No...

16:53.133 --> 16:56.058
Um, anyways, you shouldn't
be mad at Trish.

16:56.059 --> 16:58.893
I spoke to Hazel and it turns
out it was all an accident.

16:58.894 --> 17:02.331
- What do you mean?
- The motor on the spit went haywire.

17:02.332 --> 17:04.310
There was nothing Trish
could do to stop it.

17:04.310 --> 17:05.893
Really?

17:05.894 --> 17:08.836
Oh great. I just blamed
Trish for no reason.

17:08.837 --> 17:11.527
- What are you gonna do?
- First...

17:11.528 --> 17:15.564
I'm gonna get rid of this pig smell,
and then I'm gonna make it up to her.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.569
Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.358
You don't think Trish
is ready to forgive me?

17:19.359 --> 17:22.183
No, I don't think you should
get rid of that pig smell.

17:22.184 --> 17:25.723
It's really working for ya.

17:30.859 --> 17:32.960
This place looks great.

17:32.961 --> 17:35.588
Thanks for your help.
Trish is gonna love it.

17:35.589 --> 17:38.529
Whoa! Nice mountain!

17:38.720 --> 17:41.634
It's not a mountain.
It's Mauna Loa.

17:41.635 --> 17:44.748
- My second-favorite volcano.
- Hmm.

17:44.749 --> 17:50.561
- What's your favorite volcano?
- Mmm, I don't really have one.

17:50.562 --> 17:52.248
Nice touch, Dez...

17:52.249 --> 17:55.438
But please tell me it's not
actually filled with hot lava.

17:55.439 --> 17:57.953
Would I do something
that stupid?

17:57.954 --> 18:01.957
Do you really want
us to answer that?

18:01.958 --> 18:04.065
Here comes Trish!
Hurry, get ready!

18:04.066 --> 18:06.586
Oh. Oh.

18:07.727 --> 18:10.067
Aloha!

18:10.395 --> 18:14.848
And welcome to a very special
Hawaiian luau in your honor.

18:14.849 --> 18:16.772
What's all this?

18:16.773 --> 18:18.961
I wanted to make it up
to you for how I acted,

18:18.962 --> 18:21.916
and I know how much
you love luaus...

18:21.917 --> 18:23.616

I know you didn't do it on purpose and I'm
a terrible friend for thinking you did.

18:56.717 --> 19:00.727
I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have
been jealous of you and Kira.

19:00.728 --> 19:04.017
- I acted pretty stupid.
- You'll always be my best friend.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.885
Nothing can change that.

19:05.886 --> 19:08.946
I feel the same way.

19:09.122 --> 19:11.223

19:49.221 --> 19:51.266

It's not lava, it's salsa!

20:24.032 --> 20:26.967
