WEBVTT

00:00.697 --> 00:02.214
Good morning.

00:02.249 --> 00:04.355
Gabi, whatever you're making,
please make it for two.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.363
Oh, wow. Who's the lucky lady?

00:06.854 --> 00:08.054
Or gentleman.

00:08.055 --> 00:09.507
Let's not judge now.

00:09.508 --> 00:12.708
Gabi, this is my younger brother, Jake.

00:12.709 --> 00:14.396
- Jake, this is Gabi.
- Oh, hello.

00:14.397 --> 00:15.795
- (Both) Hi.
- Why didn't you tell me your brother

00:15.796 --> 00:17.160
- was coming? - I didn't know.

00:17.161 --> 00:20.017
Jake decided to show up at the
super conventional hour of 3:00 A.M.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.677
See, he marches to his own drum...

00:23.042 --> 00:24.841
which is funny because he's a drummer.

00:25.299 --> 00:26.499
Was...

00:26.500 --> 00:29.075
Then I was a forest ranger,
then I worked on an oil rig...

00:29.097 --> 00:30.813
then I was on a tuna boat...

00:30.814 --> 00:32.881
that ended up in Thailand where I...

00:35.115 --> 00:37.676
just hung out for a couple
months and now I'm here.

00:37.677 --> 00:39.744
And Jake's got big news.
He's found his calling.

00:40.089 --> 00:42.407
- Tell her. (Gasps)
- I want to be a chef.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.617
Wow! Well, good for you!

00:45.618 --> 00:48.327
Thanks! At first, I wanted to
be a cook, but then I thought,

00:48.338 --> 00:51.750
why not be a chef? It's like the
same thing, but with better pay.

00:54.604 --> 00:56.237
(Chuckles sarcastically)

00:57.128 --> 00:58.785
Actually, you know, it's not.

00:58.804 --> 01:01.551
It takes a lot of hard work
to be a professional chef.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.743
Oh, I know. I watched
<i>Ratatouille</i> on the plane.

01:05.544 --> 01:07.375
The answer is no.

01:07.376 --> 01:09.438
It's my wedding, too, and I want...

01:09.663 --> 01:11.247
Jake!

01:11.986 --> 01:13.437
What are you doing here?

01:13.444 --> 01:16.946
I heard someone was getting married,
and I want to see who I lost out to.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.891
My God.

01:19.991 --> 01:23.099
You're even cheek-bonier
than last time I saw you.

01:25.547 --> 01:26.785
This is, ah...

01:28.313 --> 01:29.513
Uh...

01:30.668 --> 01:31.868
Alan.

01:32.172 --> 01:33.619
I'm Elliot's fiance.

01:33.974 --> 01:35.791
Please never stand next to me in a photo.

01:37.153 --> 01:38.486
Gabala, quick question.

01:38.487 --> 01:41.388
Can you make appetizers for 100
people for our wedding Saturday?

01:41.389 --> 01:44.782
Uh, this Saturday, let me
check my schedule... yes!

01:44.784 --> 01:45.846
No.

01:45.847 --> 01:49.643
Our wedding's being covered by <i>In
Style</i> and <i>San Francisco Magazine.</i>

01:49.644 --> 01:51.436
It has to be classy.

01:51.864 --> 01:53.868
So you understand why
you can't do it, Gabi.

01:55.527 --> 01:57.957
Oh, you hush. She's adorable.

01:57.958 --> 01:59.170
And we're in a pinch.

01:59.171 --> 02:00.476
My mother's caterer...

02:00.477 --> 02:02.186
Tova Rosen...

02:02.813 --> 02:05.364
is doing the sit down dinner,
but we need cocktail apps

02:05.365 --> 02:08.580
that are chic and whimsical
and Tova is neither.

02:08.582 --> 02:11.094
Oh. Well, move over, Tova.

02:11.182 --> 02:14.763
'Cause, ah, chic and whimsical
cocktail apps are my specialty.

02:14.819 --> 02:18.069
Gabi, congratulations!
I'm very happy for you.

02:18.070 --> 02:19.875
And at the same time, a little concerned.

02:20.311 --> 02:23.559
Um, one week, 100 guests, that's
a lot of work for one person.

02:23.752 --> 02:24.952
A lot of work!

02:25.457 --> 02:27.451
(Whispering) Why are you crushing my dream?

02:28.566 --> 02:30.583
No! I'm not.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.914
I'm just suggesting, maybe...

02:32.965 --> 02:35.003
You hire a little extra help, my treat.

02:35.004 --> 02:36.507
Oh, that would be great. Thank you.

02:36.508 --> 02:37.852
Perfect. Jake, you got your first gig.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.487
- No!
- Yes!

02:39.822 --> 02:41.896
Uh, <i>scusi.</i>

02:42.124 --> 02:43.324
Um...

02:44.073 --> 02:46.527
You just heard how important this
wedding is to me do you really think

02:46.528 --> 02:48.682
that a drummer/forest ranger

02:48.683 --> 02:50.628
is really the right guy to be my assistant?

02:50.984 --> 02:53.173
Your boss/ the person
that pays you really does.

02:54.365 --> 02:55.797
Welcome, Jake.

02:57.334 --> 03:00.666
I am... I am excited/ not annoyed at all.

03:02.136 --> 03:03.420

03:23.871 --> 03:26.333
Okay, my stew is done.

03:26.384 --> 03:27.662
Best you'll ever have.

03:32.507 --> 03:34.028
Wow, that's, um...

03:34.083 --> 03:35.309
Something special.

03:35.343 --> 03:36.543
Told you.

03:38.203 --> 03:40.180
I think I got the cooking gene.

03:40.181 --> 03:41.381
Okay.

03:42.210 --> 03:45.563
Jake, you've obviously coasted
through life on your looks,

03:45.564 --> 03:48.145
but cooking is an acquired skill,

03:48.198 --> 03:50.981
ah, not genetic, and I
take it very seriously.

03:51.141 --> 03:52.808
You think I'm good looking?

03:56.197 --> 03:58.365
That's your takeaway? Okay, you know what?

03:58.416 --> 04:02.519
Why don't you run out and
get me some organic beets?

04:02.520 --> 04:03.720
Done.

04:04.539 --> 04:06.340
Where's the closest market?

04:06.374 --> 04:07.574
Oregon.

04:09.544 --> 04:12.546
You booked an 11 piece
band without consulting me?

04:12.548 --> 04:14.048
I want a DJ!

04:14.050 --> 04:18.869
You can't lay across a DJ's piano and
sing <i>Big Spender</i>, now can you?

04:21.690 --> 04:23.557
(Humming)

04:23.951 --> 04:25.951
I just picked up my dress for the wedding.

04:26.077 --> 04:28.526
Aw, now all you need is an invitation.

04:28.955 --> 04:30.647
He's such a kidder.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.400
Were you able to take care
of that engraving for me?

04:33.402 --> 04:37.454
Sure did. My cousin's dropping
off Elliot's ring later today.

04:37.674 --> 04:39.206
What are you two whispering about?

04:39.678 --> 04:41.088
Oh! Just that I love the dress

04:41.089 --> 04:42.408
- I picked out for her.
- Mm-hm.

04:42.409 --> 04:43.741
You picked out her dress?

04:43.742 --> 04:46.013
Is there any part of this
wedding you haven't controlled?

04:47.415 --> 04:49.928
He wanted it to match the
coral-colored guest book.

04:49.929 --> 04:52.001
Don't you know anything about gay weddings?

04:53.471 --> 04:54.671
Yes!

04:54.672 --> 04:57.341
And I'm sick of you making
all the decisions without me.

04:57.392 --> 04:58.667
It's my wedding, too.

04:58.668 --> 05:00.646
Oh, you're right, honey.

05:00.647 --> 05:02.349
Why don't you plan the honeymoon?

05:02.350 --> 05:05.182
Yay! I wanna go to Hawaii.

05:05.233 --> 05:06.664
'Cause you want to be a cliche?

05:06.715 --> 05:08.352
I am a gay man

05:08.403 --> 05:11.721
getting married in San Francisco!

05:11.722 --> 05:13.472
I am a freaking cliche!

05:16.860 --> 05:19.612
Yes! Lunch! Best part of the day.

05:25.337 --> 05:26.537
You like?

05:27.075 --> 05:29.076
I let your brother make it for you.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.404
Mmm.

05:32.964 --> 05:34.164
That's good.

05:35.263 --> 05:36.463
Is it, Josh?

05:36.464 --> 05:38.430
- Is it really?
- It's got a lot of potential.

05:38.981 --> 05:40.293
If it was a curry.

05:41.352 --> 05:43.387
But, look, Gabi, with your help...

05:43.438 --> 05:44.957
the stew can only get better.

05:45.057 --> 05:46.440
Can it, Josh?

05:46.474 --> 05:47.738
Can it really?

05:47.739 --> 05:50.432
Because this stew knows
nothing about cooking,

05:50.433 --> 05:53.503
and he's messing up my chance of one
of the biggest opportunities of my life.

05:53.504 --> 05:54.704
But, Gabi...

05:54.878 --> 05:56.947
The stew is my brother.

05:57.601 --> 06:00.301
I know, but I want to punch
him in the freakin' face!

06:00.302 --> 06:01.502
Okay, wait, Gabi.

06:02.323 --> 06:04.339
I know he's kinda all over the place,

06:04.340 --> 06:06.843
but it seems like he's finally
found something he's excited about.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.078
- Hm.
- Maybe this is his calling.

06:09.079 --> 06:11.696
Maybe you should try
another bite of his stew.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.074

06:20.770 --> 06:22.213
How long does it take to get beets?

06:22.214 --> 06:24.572
Well, once I realized Oregon was a joke,

06:24.607 --> 06:25.807
not that long.

06:27.916 --> 06:29.508
You're hating this. I can feel it.

06:29.509 --> 06:30.914
- I'm not hating it.
- You're hating

06:30.915 --> 06:32.115
- it.
- I'm hating it!

06:32.116 --> 06:34.486
Okay, I've been given the
biggest opportunity of a lifetime,

06:34.487 --> 06:37.851
and I'm spending the whole day
wasting it, training my boss's brother.

06:37.852 --> 06:40.649
Look, I get it. I'm sorry.
My brother made you hire me.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.600
If you want, I can leave right now.

06:42.601 --> 06:43.852
Oh, would you?

06:44.160 --> 06:45.827
But I really wanna learn from you.

06:45.885 --> 06:47.085
(Sighs) Why?

06:47.086 --> 06:48.361
Why me? I mean...

06:48.362 --> 06:52.398
Why not publicity? I'm sure Elliot would
be very happy to take you under his wing

06:52.399 --> 06:54.448
or any other body part.

06:57.106 --> 06:58.874
- Would you at least hear me out?
- Okay.

06:58.875 --> 07:01.623
Fine, but can you talk and roll
pasta dough at the same time?

07:02.205 --> 07:03.711
The thing is, Gabi,

07:03.844 --> 07:06.612
Josh thinks I'm a total flake
because I change jobs a lot.

07:06.613 --> 07:08.483
Yeah, well, that's kind of flaky.

07:08.484 --> 07:10.464
But, I swear this time's different.

07:10.465 --> 07:11.932
Mmm, that's what flakes say.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.893
I'm serious.

07:15.071 --> 07:17.039
I finally found something I really like.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.276
Okay, you're pushing too hard.

07:18.277 --> 07:20.439
- 'Cause I want you to believe me!
- On the dough.

07:23.215 --> 07:24.899
All right, this is gonna sound crazy,

07:24.900 --> 07:27.290
but when I was in Thailand, I
ended up living in a monastery.

07:27.291 --> 07:30.144
Oh! Don't they make you
take a vow of silence there?

07:31.138 --> 07:33.440
I don't know how you
decided to become a chef,

07:33.441 --> 07:36.425
but... and when I was in the monastery,
I got to help out in the kitchen,

07:36.426 --> 07:37.702
making food for the other monks,

07:37.703 --> 07:39.885
and you know, at first,
it was just another job...

07:39.907 --> 07:42.295
Mm-hm. Okay, that's good.
That's nice and gentle.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.760
Thanks.

07:45.928 --> 07:47.385
This is gonna sound really dumb

07:47.386 --> 07:49.123
to a professional chef like you but,

07:49.157 --> 07:50.572
you know, for me it wasn't...

07:51.026 --> 07:55.289
cooking that gave me the buzz, it was the
look on peoples' faces when they tasted...

07:55.541 --> 07:56.881
what I cooked.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.792
They can't talk, can they?

08:02.303 --> 08:05.105
I wish I could put into
words what that feeling was.

08:05.106 --> 08:08.646
No. No, I mean, I get it. That's
exactly how I fell in love with cooking.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.250
- Are you kidding?
- No,

08:10.251 --> 08:12.815
I never really met anybody that
understood that feeling before.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.630
Okay, you're almost
there, let me show you...

08:16.631 --> 08:19.010
ah, you have to push
down, but not too hard.

08:19.011 --> 08:21.175
Okay, the right amount of pressure is key.

08:21.288 --> 08:22.786
You gotta tell me, Gabi...

08:23.760 --> 08:25.488
When was your magical moment?

08:25.728 --> 08:26.989
Now... what?

08:30.466 --> 08:33.150
Whose face did you see eating your meal

08:33.152 --> 08:34.895
that gave you the feeling that...

08:35.118 --> 08:36.318
that we're talking about.

08:36.318 --> 08:38.835
Um, my dad.

08:39.573 --> 08:42.886
My mom and I, we used to watch Julia
Child together all the time, and...

08:43.179 --> 08:45.052
ah, when she died, I...

08:45.198 --> 08:47.130
made him one of Julia's recipes,

08:47.131 --> 08:49.500
and I will never forget
the look on his face.

08:49.501 --> 08:52.067
You know, I just wanted to cook forever.

08:59.726 --> 09:00.926
What was that?

09:00.927 --> 09:02.685
I'm sorry, I-I went with the moment.

09:02.686 --> 09:04.216
I don't know what got into me, but...

09:11.107 --> 09:12.307
Son of a bitch.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.588
Oh my God, Gabi!

09:17.153 --> 09:18.791
Today, after teaching my class,

09:18.792 --> 09:21.125
this mom came up to me and
said the sweetest thing.

09:21.420 --> 09:22.758
My spin class...

09:22.870 --> 09:24.462
worse than childbirth.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.716
Well...

09:26.750 --> 09:29.531
- well congratulations.
- Well, congratulations

09:29.532 --> 09:31.539
- to you, too.
- For what?

09:31.540 --> 09:33.785
For making it through the
entire day with Josh's brother.

09:33.961 --> 09:36.725
I didn't even know they
made knife-in-eye emojis.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.629
(Chuckling nervously)

09:41.048 --> 09:42.563
You know what's funny?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.986
Is that, you know, as the day went on,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.728
I really feel like I saw
a different side of him.

09:49.773 --> 09:51.708
You know, he's actually a really good...

09:51.742 --> 09:52.942
- kisser?
- Yeah.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.295
- He kissed her?
- Yeah.

09:56.297 --> 09:57.699
And she kissed him back,

09:57.700 --> 09:59.784
for, like, three and a half minutes!

10:01.560 --> 10:03.494
- That's sick!
- You're telling me.

10:03.496 --> 10:04.930
They were all over each other.

10:04.931 --> 10:06.171
I meant you!

10:06.566 --> 10:08.793
They were in my open concept living room!

10:10.394 --> 10:12.556
And the thing is, Yolanda,
seeing them together...

10:12.705 --> 10:14.137
It made me think I still...

10:14.540 --> 10:16.474
kinda might have feelings for Gabi.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.029
Kinda might?

10:18.636 --> 10:21.828
Joshua, are these feelings real

10:22.147 --> 10:24.447
or is this just some sibling rivalry?

10:24.448 --> 10:26.690
Real! Genuine.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.070
(Sighs) I think.

10:29.589 --> 10:30.789
You think?

10:31.102 --> 10:33.225
Well, you better be sure.

10:33.364 --> 10:36.896
- Because if you're not...
- There could be seismic repercussions.

10:37.026 --> 10:38.889
Gabi, Jake is Josh's brother.

10:38.890 --> 10:40.487
Yeah I know, but I can't help it.

10:40.488 --> 10:42.682
I mean, we have an amazing connection...

10:42.683 --> 10:45.512
- with food and with...
- Josh!

10:46.554 --> 10:49.114
- No, Gabi, it's too complicated!
- But...

10:49.115 --> 10:53.033
But no! Look, you're risking your
entire relationship with your boss,

10:53.034 --> 10:54.468
your career, and you're not even...

10:54.469 --> 10:56.731
100% sure how you feel.

10:56.765 --> 10:59.703
Gabi's not just some
toy Jake took from you.

11:00.378 --> 11:01.578
You're right.

11:02.231 --> 11:04.539
You're right. I won't do
anything until I know for sure.

11:04.704 --> 11:06.972
I won't do anything else
until I know for sure.

11:07.238 --> 11:09.475
But it's gonna be really hard because

11:09.476 --> 11:12.092
all I wanna do is stare into his eyes...

11:12.195 --> 11:13.644
Put him in a headlock...

11:13.670 --> 11:16.024
And just kiss him over and over again.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.706
Till he begs for mercy.

11:21.725 --> 11:25.320
Horrible, tasteless, disgusting, vile.

11:26.879 --> 11:29.663
But enough about your outfit.
These apps are actually delicious!

11:30.431 --> 11:31.883
Wow, thank you, Elliot.

11:32.151 --> 11:33.588
Don't get too excited.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.425
You're going to have to clear
these with the Jewish princess.

11:37.556 --> 11:38.891
Bye, Jake.

11:42.261 --> 11:43.945
Oh! Hey, guys.

11:43.998 --> 11:46.559
Josh, Elliot loved all of Gabi's apps.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.108
Uh-huh. Our apps.

11:48.109 --> 11:49.367
We're a team.

11:49.368 --> 11:51.199
- Stop!
- No, you stop it!

11:52.187 --> 11:53.992
Why don't you both just kinda stop?

11:55.739 --> 11:56.939
Hey, Jake,

11:57.008 --> 11:58.312
why don't you hang in my office?

11:58.313 --> 12:00.474
It's like Gabi's trying to
steal all our time together.

12:02.064 --> 12:04.828
After all these years and all these jobs,

12:04.829 --> 12:08.181
my Jake of all trades has finally
found his trade... cooking!

12:08.182 --> 12:10.658
Wow, I'm so glad I've proved myself to you.

12:10.659 --> 12:12.780
Proved yourself? Oh,
you did more than that.

12:12.781 --> 12:15.038
Look at me, I'm giddy. I'm downright giddy.

12:15.039 --> 12:16.923
Well, I got you to thank for it.

12:16.974 --> 12:18.858
You're the one who hooked me up with Gabi.

12:18.909 --> 12:21.609
(Laughing sarcastically) Yeah! I did that.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.116
So I've been thinking...

12:23.264 --> 12:25.607
What is the best way to get Jake farther

12:25.608 --> 12:27.035
and farther and...

12:27.275 --> 12:28.911
farther in his career?

12:29.113 --> 12:30.313
And then, it hit me.

12:31.505 --> 12:34.202
The Culinary Institute of America?

12:34.203 --> 12:35.842
That's the best cooking
school in the country.

12:35.843 --> 12:38.360
Jake, I pulled every string I could,
and I got you in for this semester.

12:38.361 --> 12:40.660
But, Josh, man, it's 36 grand.

12:40.661 --> 12:42.832
It's a little out of my price range by...

12:42.833 --> 12:44.033
36 grand.

12:44.725 --> 12:46.075
Consider it covered, bro.

12:47.242 --> 12:48.536
Are you serious?

12:48.806 --> 12:50.484
I-I...

12:50.954 --> 12:52.304
I don't know what to say.

12:52.650 --> 12:53.850
Your face says it all.

12:53.851 --> 12:57.025
You know, that year you spent studying
kabuki theater really paid off.

12:57.105 --> 12:59.221
Jake, you're my brother.

12:59.550 --> 13:01.868
I only invest in things I believe in 100%,

13:01.869 --> 13:04.048
and I'm 100% sure you should go away...

13:04.388 --> 13:05.857
There... to school.

13:06.526 --> 13:08.878
But it's in upstate New York
and it starts in two days.

13:08.879 --> 13:10.643
What... what am I gonna do?

13:10.763 --> 13:12.397
Jump on a plane tonight?

13:13.214 --> 13:14.414
Good point.

13:14.944 --> 13:17.033
Too bad you don't have... (Exclaims)

13:17.067 --> 13:18.392
A first class ticket.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.490
Ooh!

13:24.311 --> 13:25.511
(Knock on door)

13:30.347 --> 13:31.547
(Excitedly) Hey, you...

13:31.548 --> 13:32.748
(disinterested) Oh, it's you.

13:33.652 --> 13:35.253
That's the thanks I get?

13:35.254 --> 13:39.088
When you needed an extra oven to bake
your pot pies in, I was your best friend.

13:39.537 --> 13:42.872
Oh, I know, thank you. You're a life saver.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.538
Elliot's going to be so happy.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.435
Well, there's a downside to everything.

13:49.915 --> 13:51.270
Let me see...

13:51.271 --> 13:52.521
What are you looking for?

13:52.522 --> 13:56.835
Oh, nothing really. I don't want
to raise any red flags, but, ah...

13:56.957 --> 13:58.999
Have you seen a man's
wedding band around here?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.454
You lost Elliot's wedding ring?

14:00.455 --> 14:03.038
Uh-ah! It's only lost...
If I don't find it.

14:03.039 --> 14:05.554
Oh, my God! Well, when was the
last ah! It's time you saw it?

14:05.807 --> 14:07.253
"When was the last time I saw it?"

14:07.254 --> 14:10.286
(Laughs) You don't think I've thought,
"When was the last time I saw it?"

14:12.763 --> 14:14.330
When was the last time I saw it?

14:16.343 --> 14:18.828
I put it on my thumb because
I didn't want to lose it,

14:18.829 --> 14:20.981
and then I made your pot pies and...

14:22.650 --> 14:24.017
Oh, my damn!

14:25.014 --> 14:26.636
Good thing I'm hungry.

14:30.819 --> 14:32.694
- Hey, Jakey.
- Hey, Yolanda.

14:32.695 --> 14:33.895
Hi.

14:36.579 --> 14:38.347
- Hey!
- Hi.

14:39.331 --> 14:40.736
Um, I think it would be a...

14:40.805 --> 14:42.184
good idea if we talked about

14:42.236 --> 14:43.736
what happened yesterday.

14:43.737 --> 14:46.605
I think it would be a good
idea if we talked about

14:46.611 --> 14:50.054
the fact I got into the
Culinary Institute of America.

14:50.177 --> 14:52.087
What? Oh, my God, that's huge.

14:52.096 --> 14:54.819
That's impossible. How did that happen?

14:54.982 --> 14:56.845
I mean, er, congratulations.

14:56.846 --> 14:58.350
So, you think I should go?

14:58.351 --> 14:59.917
No! I mean...

15:00.302 --> 15:02.168
Yes, ah, why wouldn't you?

15:03.408 --> 15:05.783
Well, starting with yesterday...

15:06.604 --> 15:08.070
because of us.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.980
Not that we're already an "us,"

15:09.981 --> 15:12.169
but I feels like we might be
going in an "us" direction.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.287
That's really sweet. I feel that, too.

15:14.451 --> 15:17.187
Um, but you know what I also feel?

15:18.919 --> 15:21.229
Curious as to, ah...

15:21.230 --> 15:25.001
As to how you got into one of
the best schools in the country

15:25.002 --> 15:28.169
when you just decided you wanted
to be a chef, like, two days ago.

15:28.170 --> 15:29.581
So, ah...

15:30.307 --> 15:31.712
How did that happen?

15:32.323 --> 15:35.417
Well, Josh really believes in me,
and he gave me the money for tuition.

15:35.539 --> 15:38.265
Oh! He did?

15:39.011 --> 15:42.113
Yeah, and he had to pull
some strings to get me in.

15:42.546 --> 15:44.263
Pulling strings, is he?

15:45.206 --> 15:46.847
Yeah, I didn't even ask him.

15:46.848 --> 15:50.294
He's just so excited for me to go that
he came up with the whole plan himself.

15:50.473 --> 15:53.006
Coming up with plans, is he?

15:53.007 --> 15:55.299
What can I say? He's an amazing guy.

15:55.300 --> 15:59.114
(Laughing sarcastically)

15:59.115 --> 16:00.379
Is he?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.290
Is he?

16:09.008 --> 16:10.325
You saw us kiss.

16:10.359 --> 16:13.755
That's the only explanation for
your big sudden gesture to Jake.

16:13.756 --> 16:15.813
- Gabi...
- Don't Gabi me! Okay?

16:15.848 --> 16:17.639
You've been asking me for two days

16:17.640 --> 16:18.978
to take him on and teach him how to cook,

16:18.979 --> 16:21.653
and now you suddenly want
to send him 3,000 miles away?

16:21.687 --> 16:23.003
Interesting, Josh.

16:23.339 --> 16:25.514
Real interesting.

16:26.208 --> 16:27.408
Is it?

16:27.409 --> 16:29.332
He wanted to learn, you taught him,

16:29.333 --> 16:31.312
he showed progress, and how he's moved on.

16:32.101 --> 16:33.468
Don't make sense.

16:33.469 --> 16:35.341
That doesn't work with me.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.404
I know something's up.

16:37.405 --> 16:38.611
Oh, really? Like what?

16:38.612 --> 16:40.679
Like, you saw me with
Jake and you got jealous.

16:40.939 --> 16:43.980
Jealous? (Chuckles) Gabi, I'm
almost embarrassed for you.

16:44.943 --> 16:47.033
I did this because I care about my brother,

16:47.034 --> 16:48.459
and I thought you'd be happy.

16:48.681 --> 16:50.698
Now you get to work on
the wedding yourself,

16:50.733 --> 16:52.411
which is what you wanted.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.552
So instead of screaming at
the innocent party here...

16:54.554 --> 16:56.537
<i>moi...</i> why don't
you try focusing on that?

16:56.588 --> 17:00.274
Okay, okay. You're right. Alan and Elliot
are the most important thing right now.

17:00.465 --> 17:01.665
The wedding's off!

17:03.781 --> 17:06.733
(Sobbing) Why does everything happen to me?

17:09.207 --> 17:10.773
(Knocking on door)

17:10.809 --> 17:12.561
- Oh! Hey.
- Hey, Gabala.

17:12.563 --> 17:14.971
Thanks for bringing my stuff
from Elliot's place here.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.630
I couldn't bear to go to the
penthouse and see his face.

17:17.699 --> 17:21.036
Okay, one more step...

17:21.636 --> 17:22.836
And...

17:23.905 --> 17:25.526
Gabi's?

17:25.757 --> 17:28.525
Josh, you said we're
going to a steak house,

17:28.560 --> 17:30.428
not God's mistake house.

17:33.381 --> 17:35.115
(Both screaming)

17:35.448 --> 17:38.085
- What's he doing here?
- Oh, my God, this is a set up!

17:38.119 --> 17:39.412
(Both) Surprise!

17:40.088 --> 17:42.056
I don't know what you two are planning,

17:42.057 --> 17:43.672
but it's not gonna work.

17:44.507 --> 17:46.143
(Romantic music playing)

17:46.144 --> 17:49.311
- It's like a fairy tale!
- Pure enchantment!

17:50.501 --> 17:51.701
(Grunts)

17:51.820 --> 17:56.231
To think I would even consider marrying
someone so selfish and dramatic.

17:56.232 --> 17:57.714
Oh, I'm dramatic?

17:57.775 --> 17:59.245
Puhleeze!

17:59.569 --> 18:01.609
All I was trying to do was
make our wedding perfect.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.578
Exactly! "Our wedding."

18:03.600 --> 18:05.091
You didn't include me at all.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.846
What happened to the romantic
man I fell in love with?

18:10.053 --> 18:11.693
You're making me stress eat.

18:12.110 --> 18:13.310
Ow!

18:14.223 --> 18:15.474
What the hell is this?

18:16.539 --> 18:18.257
Oh, my God! You found the ring...

18:19.661 --> 18:21.154
That Alan planted.

18:21.930 --> 18:24.009
"Forever, my FMB."

18:24.033 --> 18:25.528
Fluffy matzo ball.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.934
I know I went a little
crazy with the wedding,

18:28.935 --> 18:30.942
but I would never forget you.

18:31.228 --> 18:33.446
I love you, fluffy matzo ball.

18:34.176 --> 18:36.438
And I love you, my yiddish yam.

18:38.745 --> 18:40.097
Wanna get outta here?

18:40.148 --> 18:41.683
Since the moment I walked in.

18:47.239 --> 18:48.872
I can't believe your plan worked!

18:48.873 --> 18:50.753
Yeah, well, I couldn't
have done it without you.

18:50.768 --> 18:53.001
And planting t rin in
the pot pie, I mean...

18:53.002 --> 18:54.242
Nice touch!

18:54.805 --> 18:56.125
We are a good team.

18:56.126 --> 18:57.383
I guess we are.

19:00.576 --> 19:02.975
Be a shame to let this
music go to waste, huh?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.317
May I have this dance?

19:07.301 --> 19:08.585
Okay.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.344
Gabi, there's something I want to tell you.

19:17.386 --> 19:19.116
There's something I want to tell you, too.

19:20.557 --> 19:23.464
These past couple of days
have been kinda crazy,

19:23.465 --> 19:25.917
and they've made me kinda crazy, and...

19:26.273 --> 19:28.664
I, um, I accused you of being jealous,

19:28.665 --> 19:30.407
when, really, all you were doing was

19:30.408 --> 19:32.106
looking out for your brother, so...

19:32.131 --> 19:33.331
I'm really sorry.

19:34.513 --> 19:35.713
Okay, your turn.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.418
Gabi...

19:39.211 --> 19:40.732
The real reason...

19:41.113 --> 19:42.670
I wanted my brother to go away...

19:45.213 --> 19:47.264
- is because I think I have...
- (Honking)

19:48.399 --> 19:50.226
- What the...
- (Jake) Gabi!

19:50.997 --> 19:52.540
Gabi, come out here!

19:53.472 --> 19:54.813
Oh, my God!

19:54.867 --> 19:56.560
_

19:56.624 --> 19:58.208
Is that my brother?

19:58.209 --> 19:59.757
Look at what I got for us!

19:59.846 --> 20:03.163
Oh, hey, Josh! I'm not going
to the culinary institute.

20:04.582 --> 20:07.500
I got this food truck
for me and Gabi instead!

20:07.832 --> 20:09.799
It's got my name on it!

20:11.505 --> 20:13.457
- What a piece of...
- I love it!

20:16.344 --> 20:17.544
(Exclaiming excitedly)

20:20.184 --> 20:21.565
The ring has to be here.

20:21.566 --> 20:22.766
I've looked everywhere else.

20:22.767 --> 20:24.499
Well, did you check the couch?

20:25.281 --> 20:27.249
My God! $100!

20:27.250 --> 20:29.001
That's more than my whole couch is worth.

20:30.804 --> 20:32.004
Note to self,

20:32.005 --> 20:33.302
start cleaning the couch.

20:35.842 --> 20:37.926
We should spend that on
something responsible.

20:37.978 --> 20:39.825
- Like paying bills?
- No.

20:39.846 --> 20:42.064
"Something responsible" is the
name of the horse I want to bet on.

20:42.065 --> 20:43.646
Girl, come on!

20:43.679 --> 20:48.383
