01:06.816 --> 01:08.234
Hello, ma'am.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.533
-Hello there!
-Hello, ma'am!

01:15.617 --> 01:17.869
-Hey. Go, Hurry along.
-Yes, ma'am.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.913
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you!

01:19.996 --> 01:21.498
Have a good day!

01:29.047 --> 01:30.090
But, Yeo-jeong,

01:30.965 --> 01:33.259
I'm not looking for a prince now.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.096
Rather than a prince,

01:36.679 --> 01:39.432
I need an executioner with me

01:39.516 --> 01:41.059
who can help me in the hunt.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.399
Thanks so much.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.611
GYODAE CAFE

01:57.367 --> 02:00.537
How is it a lowly fellow
would dare order the director around?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.665
But didn't you have
a nice walk through the park?

02:04.457 --> 02:06.167
-Is that your lunch?
-It's breakfast.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.837
Huh? Ah, come on now. What is this, even?

02:09.337 --> 02:11.506
-I know you're busy, but you have to eat.
-I'm on a diet.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.633
I want to lose four kilograms
and wear a bikini

02:13.716 --> 02:15.552
when I go on my Christmas trip to Guam.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.388
Ah, nice.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.305
Thank you.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.269
Mom, I've finally made my decision.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.021
-What?
-I don't wanna teach.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.023
Sure, that's fair.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.234
I want my own practice.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.819
That's great too,

02:32.902 --> 02:35.155
but you just decided that now?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.531
I knew a while ago.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.783
But I only decided
to tell you about it now.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.832
You're serious?

02:46.416 --> 02:47.250
Yeah, I am.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.216
Good.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.970
Honestly, I'm just happy you didn't
decide to stay in the military forever.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.430
This is a better plan.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.516
Where are you thinking?
Apgujeong? Cheongdam?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.809
Uh, no.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.894
In Semyeong.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.772
The person I'm interested in right now
lives in Semyeong.

03:10.982 --> 03:11.900
You have a girlfriend?

03:11.983 --> 03:14.068
Haven't gotten that far yet.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.322
This is what she's like, Mom.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.366
She's so calm, as if she's a still pond.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.286
But makes me feel like I'm in a storm.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.288
Does she fish?

03:25.371 --> 03:26.581
It's a metaphor, Mom.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.291
So, you're not doing this for money,

03:28.374 --> 03:30.627
or to help out
a medically underprivileged region.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.711
It's for a girl?

03:32.795 --> 03:36.257
-You write all that on your little letter?
-Oh, God.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.467
I'll write a new one, okay?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.344
Ow!

03:39.427 --> 03:40.762
You're embarrassing, you know?

03:41.638 --> 03:42.889
Are you sure you just eat salad?

03:48.394 --> 03:51.272
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>I believed in all the gods.</i>

03:53.024 --> 03:55.068
<i>I kneeled in front of them,</i>

03:55.652 --> 03:57.195
<i>praying for salvation.</i>

03:58.529 --> 04:01.241
<i>I was like a patient</i>
<i>with a terminal illness,</i>

04:01.324 --> 04:03.534
<i>latching onto the smallest bit of hope.</i>

04:04.702 --> 04:06.579
<i>I wonder where you are right now</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:08.122
<i>and what you're praying for.</i>

04:17.048 --> 04:20.051
Sew this into Ye-sol's bag
where she won't be able to see it.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.553
Make sure no one touches it.
Do it yourself.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.764
Thank you, Mom.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.599
Did you just find out…

04:28.393 --> 04:30.728
Ye-sol's homeroom teacher

04:30.812 --> 04:31.813
is that bitch?

04:33.439 --> 04:36.359
You're so incompetent.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.444
You should just go home.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.571
I'll take care of this myself.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.075
Whose son-in-law is it
that works in the Ministry of Education?

04:44.158 --> 04:45.326
Oh, stop that.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.414
What if you provoke her, and that bitch
starts to tell people what happened?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.582
What if everybody that I know finds out?

04:53.084 --> 04:54.294
I'm so scared, Mom.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.254
Why are you so scared
of a nobody like her?

04:56.337 --> 04:59.590
It's not her that I'm scared of.
I'm just scared for Ye-sol.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.968
If everyone finds out, Ye-sol will, too.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.015
She might not understand now,
but what if she grows up and finds out?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.559
I'm terrified of that.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.313
Yeon-jin.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.232
Look at me.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.736
Remember what I told you before?

05:20.820 --> 05:21.863
Never look back.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.991
You won't find solutions in the past.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.452
They're always in front of you.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.331
That's just what life is like.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.833
Got it?

05:54.354 --> 05:57.648
OCTOBER 31ST - NOVEMBER 6TH
FLIGHT SCHEDULE

05:59.692 --> 06:01.652
<i>That's when I realized</i>

06:02.153 --> 06:03.488
<i>that God doesn't exist.</i>

06:04.072 --> 06:05.406
<i>We're all just pretending.</i>

06:07.408 --> 06:08.576
<i>So, you know what?</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:11.996
<i>You should pray to me, Yeon-jin.</i>

06:13.956 --> 06:17.251
<i>I'm your only chance for salvation.</i>

06:20.088 --> 06:22.006
Wow, he's a handsome guy.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.550
Who's that?

06:24.634 --> 06:25.635
Boyfriend?

06:27.261 --> 06:29.180
-Can you get us coffee, Mr. Kang?
-Huh?

06:31.265 --> 06:33.810
-Oh, sure.
-I don't need a coffee.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.395
I don't mind.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.067
That's exactly your problem.
You only know when we tell you.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.987
Is there something
you want to talk to me about, Mr. Chu?

06:45.071 --> 06:47.657
No, not at all.
I've heard you're a great teacher.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.827
I just want to share
a cup of coffee.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.877
MS. KANG

06:59.961 --> 07:02.296
<i>Please call me, ma'am. It's urgent.</i>

07:03.423 --> 07:05.383
Is your boyfriend good to you?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.594
I bet he is, right?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.930
I dunno why, but I just assumed

07:11.013 --> 07:13.683
that you'd be into older men,
instead of some young boyfriend.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.394
Oh, unless you have both?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.231
Kidding.

07:23.192 --> 07:26.112
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Do I look like I have one?

07:26.195 --> 07:27.155
You really don't.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.490
Why?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.950
Oh, has nobody told you?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.911
Well, I won't say anything.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.875
I can just tell, you're very talented

07:40.126 --> 07:41.669
at saying things that piss people off.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.880
Just like you and creeping people out.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.797
Huh?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.301
Seriously, Ms. Moon.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.929
You should be very thankful right now
that you're a woman.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.391
Because if you were a man,
I would have smacked you.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.476
Oh, really?

07:57.852 --> 08:00.646
Well, you do look like
somebody who only fights women.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.820
I'm only kidding.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.199
You sounded cute
when you said that before,

08:11.282 --> 08:12.408
so I wanted to try it.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.463
I'm not sure
where Son Myeong-o…

08:26.005 --> 08:29.008
I've lost him a few times before,
when he rides his bike,

08:29.717 --> 08:32.553
but I could usually always find him

08:32.637 --> 08:34.430
by watching his apartment
for a few days or so.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.974
But after this day,
he hasn't been home or at the club.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.229
You last saw him
at the travel agency here?

08:41.312 --> 08:42.313
Yeah.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.816
What if he's back on their side now?

08:45.900 --> 08:46.901
For money, you know?

08:46.984 --> 08:49.362
Since he got
the plane ticket that day,

08:49.445 --> 08:52.198
and then he just left the country
the very next day.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.618
I'll check out the travel agency.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.623
Wait until the weekend.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.832
See what happens.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.750
Right.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.796
Unless he's been murdered,
it's not really in our best interest

09:06.879 --> 09:08.256
to disclose that he's gone missing.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.592
If he's actually been murdered,
you say? What?

09:14.470 --> 09:16.931
So, you really think
he might already be dead?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.766
It's definitely possible.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.060
-I'll contact you.
-Hold on!

09:21.727 --> 09:23.521
Um, did you…

09:25.690 --> 09:26.524
by any chance

09:28.609 --> 09:29.485
do that to him?

09:30.486 --> 09:32.113
You're asking if I killed him?

09:32.196 --> 09:33.030
Son Myeong-o?

09:33.656 --> 09:36.158
If you did, seriously,

09:36.242 --> 09:39.620
then I should know about it,
so I can prepare for whatever occurs.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.705
No, you don't.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.874
Even if I did,
you don't need to know about it.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.043
What?

09:46.127 --> 09:49.213
The deal that you and I made
at the beginning is a simple one.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.634
You do what I ask you to do,
and I do what you ask of me.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.803
That's all we need to do for each other.

09:58.055 --> 09:58.889
You and I,

10:00.099 --> 10:01.601
we've gotten too close, ma'am.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.884
Dad's home, Louis.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.181
I haven't been home in a really long time.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.433
I know. I'm sorry.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.861
What? Louis!

10:54.612 --> 10:56.072
Oh, shit.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.077
Why are you doing that, huh?

11:02.578 --> 11:05.081
I just apologized, didn't I?

11:06.707 --> 11:08.918
So you're mad because I haven't been home.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.881
What is this?

11:25.976 --> 11:26.852
Oh, shit.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.355
What the fuck?

11:31.732 --> 11:33.651
Motherfucker, where the hell are you?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.903
Guess that fucker was right here.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.322
God, that son of a bitch.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.032
No, not you.

11:42.952 --> 11:43.953
By the way, Louis…

11:46.831 --> 11:48.207
what did you do when he did this?

11:48.791 --> 11:49.917
Did you bite him?

11:50.000 --> 11:55.131
If you just watched it happen,
I'll be really… disappointed.

How can she expect people
to take her seriously

12:16.360 --> 12:18.070
when she can't even write her own scripts?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.447
Even newbies write their scripts.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.199
We have
another Jaepyeong Construction ad.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.369
Su-mi?

12:27.204 --> 12:29.373
Oh, what? Did you hear that?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.000
Well, you said it pretty loud.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.336
Well, they do say that truth is
louder in your ears, Yeon-jin.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.217
Hey, is this <i>The Newsroom</i>?

12:41.093 --> 12:42.136
Su-mi.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.513
You should listen
to our friend over there.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.433
She just said
that my husband gave us another ad.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.477
Don't you understand what that means?

12:49.560 --> 12:53.814
This little station only pays me
2.2 million won a month,

12:53.898 --> 12:58.736
but my husband is giving this place
220 million won, understand?

12:59.236 --> 13:00.905
I know that you're young.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.656
But how long will that last you?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.575
Until next year?
Or maybe the year after that?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.577
Oh my God, you little--

13:06.660 --> 13:09.872
I'm saying that no matter
how much fucking collagen that you use,

13:10.831 --> 13:13.042
you will never be able to be like me.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.419
You're just a young bitch.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.422
So, listen, Su-mi,

13:18.506 --> 13:21.133
I can convince them
not to renew your contract,

13:21.217 --> 13:23.177
so don't tempt me, all right?

13:30.309 --> 13:31.477
Please enjoy your meal.

13:32.937 --> 13:33.938
What about Dong-eun?

13:35.231 --> 13:36.148
Still nothing?

13:39.109 --> 13:43.197
Finding someone's private information,
it's not as easy as you might be thinking.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.451
Pulling up info requires
piggybacking onto other cases.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.164
JAE-JUN

13:53.290 --> 13:55.209
If it were easy, I'd do it.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.508
You know, the world has changed.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.010
It's not the same world as 18 years ago.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.347
That's why I'm not paying you
the amount I did 18 years ago.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.102
I heard you own a motel,
under your sister's name.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.521
A lot of customers?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.109
Thank you for asking.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.444
I meant to condescend.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.907
I've put some men on it.
I'll let you know when I get something.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.495
You seem way too busy, you know that?

14:35.457 --> 14:36.667
Thanks for your concern.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.753
I checked Myeong-o's ticket.

14:41.505 --> 14:45.134
He bought a one-way ticket
for Vladivostok, and nothing else.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.096
Then he didn't even board the flight
he got the one-way ticket for.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.725
And I checked the hotel he reserved too,
but it looks like a no-show.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.562
So he definitely didn't leave the country.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.605
Right.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.149
So, why'd you ask about him?
Is something wrong?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.109
Yeah.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.279
I'm not sure if the guy's just missing,

15:05.362 --> 15:07.990
or if I need to go get ready
for his funeral.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.536
I mean, you do have
a lot of black clothes.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.165
Yeah. I do.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.629
<i>Guess Myeong-o</i>
<i>has been snapped in half.</i>

15:22.379 --> 15:25.215
<i>Well, SD cards are expendable anyway.</i>

15:29.094 --> 15:30.095
<i>Now, I think</i>

15:30.763 --> 15:34.266
<i>I'll have to look for a real butterfly</i>
<i>that'll flap its wings for me.</i>

15:42.483 --> 15:44.860
<i>And I know a butterfly with silk wings</i>

15:44.944 --> 15:46.278
<i>that will help me</i>

15:46.362 --> 15:48.489
<i>brew up a hurricane, Yeon-jin.</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:02.586
The wires are all done!
Let's light them up now!

16:09.093 --> 16:11.887
Great work, everyone.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.934
We thank you on behalf of the city.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.187
Thank you for staying so late here, sir.
We truly appreciate it.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.022
Honestly, I would call it early, not late.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.024
Oh, yes, that's true.

16:25.901 --> 16:26.986
Great work with this.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.447
I want to commemorate this
and look around.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.615
Yes, of course.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.593
<i>Fuck, Myeong-o, come on.</i>

17:35.971 --> 17:37.681
<i>I'm out of ice and grass now.</i>

17:40.267 --> 17:41.935
<i>Where are you? Can we meet?</i>

17:42.436 --> 17:43.437
<i>Want to come over?</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:45.022
You wanna see me alone?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.106
<i>Why?</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:51.695
<i>Come on, read my text.</i>
<i>Fucking read it.</i>

18:07.628 --> 18:09.296
<i>Which ring looks better?</i>

18:09.379 --> 18:11.465
<i>The asshole</i>
<i>didn't come to work again today.</i>

18:11.548 --> 18:12.966
<i>And he stole my clothes and watches.</i>

18:13.050 --> 18:16.678
<i>Can you pick one out of these three?</i>
<i>Oh wow, really?</i>

18:16.762 --> 18:19.014
<i>-Which watches?</i>
-<i>Hey, I paid you in advance.</i>

18:19.598 --> 18:21.517
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>that you did something stupid.</i>

18:21.600 --> 18:22.601
<i>Business is business.</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:38.367
Would you like to look at another design?

18:38.450 --> 18:39.868
This stone might be too big.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.912
It could be uncomfortable
when you wear it.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.956
No way.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.625
I vastly prefer the big ones.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.420
I like everything big, you know?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.427
Tae-uk, hi!

18:57.511 --> 18:59.721
You're early!
I thought you were going to be late.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.432
I haven't managed to pick one out,
because they're so pretty.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.184
Five minutes, please.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.574
Yo, didn't I tell you
to wear high heels around me?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.493
You know I like it when you look tall.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.621
Even if you wear flats,
I won't look taller than you.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.582
Are you really
that embarrassed of my height

19:26.665 --> 19:29.126
No, my legs just hurt because of work.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.628
I'll wear heels next time.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.006
I'm not going to propose.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.842
You just want a bigger stone
than your friends, don't you?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.344
Here. That's the biggest one.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.224
Really? Wow!

19:44.308 --> 19:46.977
Oh, I love it!
God, it is bigger than the one she has!

19:49.104 --> 19:50.105
Oh, also,

19:50.814 --> 19:52.399
my mom wanted me to tell you.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.152
Don't suggest eating meat to her, okay?

19:55.235 --> 19:57.196
She's vegetarian, you hear me? Hmm?

19:57.696 --> 20:01.992
Yeah, I know. I don't like
eating meat that much, either.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.880
<i>Change directions!</i>
<i>Someone's following your car!</i>

20:14.963 --> 20:16.298
<i>They're right behind you!</i>

20:22.471 --> 20:25.766
-What are you doing driving behind me?
<i>-Listen, that's not important right now!</i>

20:26.433 --> 20:28.644
Ugh, I've been doing this every day,

20:28.727 --> 20:31.396
and I never considered
they might send someone to follow us.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.107
I'll just… I'll find a way
to lose them, okay?

20:34.191 --> 20:35.609
No, I'll do it.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.527
Make sure they don't notice you.

20:50.874 --> 20:51.708
Huh?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.060
You have a death wish?

21:52.644 --> 21:54.604
What the hell were you doing
with your brakes?

21:54.688 --> 21:56.690
I'm sorry about this. Are you guys hurt?

21:56.773 --> 21:59.234
Oh, my back. Ugh, my neck.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.320
What are you gonna fucking do now?

22:01.403 --> 22:02.738
We're pretty busy people.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.907
So, make your choice between
calling the cops or paying me in cash.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.909
I think you gave me the wrong options.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.330
You're supposed to call
your insurance now, not the police.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.499
If it's a rental car,
call where you rented it.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.255
Fucking shit. Well, aren't you smart.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.009
This is my favorite rental car, okay?

22:26.720 --> 22:28.347
And since you caused the crash,

22:29.306 --> 22:31.058
you should call the cops,

22:31.141 --> 22:33.101
or just give me some fucking cash now.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.562
'Cause this is crazy.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.608
I'm getting scolded on the street,
next to my broken car.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.903
Since we're both busy,
let's do this in cash.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.488
What's your bank number?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.157
That'd be a deposit.
I want you to give me cash.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.371
Give me your phone number.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.098
Meet me with cash when I call you.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.237
Did you get hurt anywhere? Let me see.

24:09.489 --> 24:12.200
Weren't you following Jung Jae-jun today?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.077
So why were you driving behind me?

24:14.744 --> 24:17.205
Why did you follow me, then?

24:18.748 --> 24:20.876
I mean, why would I be following you?

24:24.796 --> 24:27.215
Are you suspicious of me right now?

24:30.051 --> 24:31.428
I'm just being careful.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.597
Aren't you nervous too?

24:34.222 --> 24:37.851
I could go to your husband now
and tell him you asked me to kill him.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.812
I could just tell him
everything, whenever.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.731
I'm sure you must have thought about that.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.698
I saw Jae-jun
in front of the school where you work.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.450
He was watching Ye-sol.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.287
So, I happened to be there
because I was following him.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.914
And then I saw you drive by.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.709
I was so happy. Then I saw those people.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.508
I guess that I could worry about all that.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.262
But I wasn't thinking about that at all.

25:14.763 --> 25:15.764
I really wasn't.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.475
I was too busy with the camera,

25:18.558 --> 25:20.727
and then too busy focusing on driving.

25:24.898 --> 25:25.857
Get out with me.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.632
The restaurant that Jae-jun
goes to often is inside the market.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.634
I got cabbage and made kimchi.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.053
Eat it soon.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.639
I've been carrying it around.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.101
And, if you think about it,

26:01.768 --> 26:04.688
I could spill your secrets
to a lot more people, okay?

26:05.605 --> 26:07.732
Park Yeon-jin, Jeon Jae-jun, Lee Sa-ra.

26:09.776 --> 26:13.572
I was happy buying those cabbages.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.575
I started to dream, since we've met.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.829
Dreaming about dinner with Seon-a…

26:26.543 --> 26:28.962
And not a dinner
where you just scarf down your food.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.634
But a proper dinner, with stew and eggs,

26:35.552 --> 26:37.345
where you eat as slow as you want.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.641
That kind of dinner is my dream.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.187
I get so happy thinking about it.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.322
So you still have other thoughts, then?

26:56.239 --> 26:57.240
Hmm?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.369
Oh. I guess.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.500
Oh.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.669
I'm sorry.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.839
Oh, why am I like this?

27:15.842 --> 27:17.302
Because you're a good person.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.354
That was my fault. I'm sorry.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.441
Your dream will come true.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.945
And you're so kind,
but I can't take the kimchi.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.707
<i>The two of us</i>
<i>mostly call each other "ma'am."</i>

27:47.791 --> 27:49.125
<i>We're still so distant.</i>

27:51.378 --> 27:53.296
<i>But what else would we call each other</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:55.882
<i>as we plot people's deaths together?</i>

27:59.803 --> 28:01.763
<i>We know everything about the darkness</i>

28:02.722 --> 28:04.808
<i>that we plan to unleash, Yeon-jin.</i>

28:06.101 --> 28:08.269
<i>We know how dark it'll be in the end.</i>

28:13.441 --> 28:16.653
<i>The person</i>
<i>you're trying to reach is not available…</i>

28:16.736 --> 28:20.073
Is Yeon-jin not picking up?
Myeong-o's not answering, either.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.951
Maybe they're together somewhere.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.039
You don't know if you're the only guy
Yeon-jin's sleeping with.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.916
Watch your fucking mouth, okay?

28:29.999 --> 28:34.045
I'm just saying,
neither of them is answering their phones.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.256
-But whatever.
-Hye-jeong.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.886
If you want to be a bitch,
then do it right.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.182
You want to be
a successful bitch, don't you?

28:46.683 --> 28:48.143
You're so sloppy.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.275
I have to go now. I have a flight.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.368
Hey, you know Yeon-jin's daughter?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.580
-Ye-sol?
-What about her?

29:12.751 --> 29:13.918
Aren't those Yeon-jin's heels?

29:14.419 --> 29:18.506
I bought them for a flight to London.
I didn't know that she also had them.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.424
What about Ye-sol?

29:20.467 --> 29:21.676
Know when her birthday is?

29:22.469 --> 29:23.470
Ye-sol's birthday?

29:23.553 --> 29:24.721
Do you know or not?

29:24.804 --> 29:26.431
I don't know her exact birthday,

29:27.724 --> 29:30.852
but I know Yeon-jin's mother
set a date for her when she got pregnant,

29:30.935 --> 29:32.187
sometime before Chuseok.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.522
She thought it would bring wealth.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.191
Why do you care now?

29:36.900 --> 29:37.901
Huh.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.614
I wonder if she's my daughter.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.449
Man, you're insane!

29:46.493 --> 29:48.244
When the sun doesn't sink
below the horizon

29:48.328 --> 29:49.579
in the middle of the summer,

29:49.662 --> 29:52.081
in certain places,
it makes the nights look as bright as day.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.166
It's called a white night.

29:53.249 --> 29:54.083
Yeah, that's right.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.085
It makes it bright all day and night.

29:56.169 --> 29:59.547
Did you know that during white nights,
on the opposite hemisphere,

29:59.631 --> 30:02.592
people have to endure a "polar night"
where it stays dark all day?

30:03.301 --> 30:05.470
I would hate it
if nights lasted that long.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.807
The reason why they call this
a polar night instead of a dark night

30:08.890 --> 30:12.602
is because the nights are so long,
like the polar opposite of a white night.

30:13.228 --> 30:17.398
So, I ask the listeners, were your nights
white or polar during the past week?

30:18.024 --> 30:21.945
<i>I hope you'll get through any tough times</i>
<i>and polar nights throughout the next week.</i>

30:22.028 --> 30:23.238
<i>I'm Park Yeon-jin.</i>

30:23.321 --> 30:24.656
<i>I'm Kwang-hee.</i>

30:24.739 --> 30:28.117
<i>I'm here with everyone's</i>
<i>favorite forecaster, Park Yeon-jin,</i>

30:28.201 --> 30:29.577
<i>for the show </i>Crazy or Bright.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.538
<i>And we've just heard</i>
<i>some amazing stuff from her!</i>

30:31.621 --> 30:33.331
<i>We'll be back after some ads.</i>

30:48.179 --> 30:50.765
This location has
a very high ceiling,

30:50.849 --> 30:53.643
and it also has a skylight,
which lets in a lot of sunlight.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.271
And it looks even better at night.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.817
This looks great. I'll take this one.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.570
It's newly built,
right near a station.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.613
It's very nice, both day and night.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.657
There's a yoga studio and a gym here.

31:08.491 --> 31:12.161
If people hurt themselves working out,
you'll get some new patients.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.122
Your practice would be perfect here.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.915
What kind of doctor are you?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.959
It'd be perfect
if you were an orthopedic surgeon.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.377
I'm a plastic surgeon.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.795
Even better!

31:20.879 --> 31:24.090
I mean, they can get double-eyelid surgery
after their workout.

31:26.759 --> 31:27.969
I definitely want this place.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.305
You sure you're a doctor?

31:31.014 --> 31:32.181
-What?
-You're so eager,

31:32.265 --> 31:34.100
you might be trying to scam me.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.938
You're very handsome for a doctor.

31:39.022 --> 31:39.856
Ah.

31:40.732 --> 31:44.444
I don't usually brag about these things,
but my nickname is "Mr. Handsome."

31:45.320 --> 31:47.822
People don't believe
I'm a doctor with this face.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.657
I can't even bring up my Mensa membership,

31:49.741 --> 31:52.035
or that I skipped some grades
back in school.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.412
I liked it better
when you weren't talking.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.209
Here's your schedule,
and your mail.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.837
On the very top is
the express delivered one.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.464
What?

32:07.759 --> 32:08.760
Hmm.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.070
SON MYEONG-O

33:00.186 --> 33:01.187

SON MYEONG-O

33:02.730 --> 33:06.234
<i>The person</i>
<i>you're trying to reach is not available…</i>

33:07.527 --> 33:08.820
Who's here, you said?

33:13.741 --> 33:15.201
It's been a while.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.080
Around three years?

33:21.499 --> 33:24.836
At the opening of your father-in-law's
new building, I believe.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.048
Doesn't look like you're here to golf.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.676
I'm very curious what brought you here.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.013
I can't reach Mr. Son Myeong-o.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.599
Do you know where he might be now?

33:38.683 --> 33:40.810
Wow, you're looking for him as well?

33:43.479 --> 33:44.897
I can't reach him either.

33:45.690 --> 33:46.899
Why do you want to know?

33:55.199 --> 33:56.034
Want one?

33:56.117 --> 33:57.118
I don't care for it.

33:58.786 --> 34:01.164
Do you know
of any other way I can reach him?

34:03.249 --> 34:06.961
You didn't… tell me
why you're looking for him.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.046
It's private.

34:09.005 --> 34:09.964
Between him and me.

34:12.258 --> 34:14.719
If you have his address,
names of family members, anything…

34:16.679 --> 34:17.972
You get something from him too?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.517
I bet you did.

34:22.477 --> 34:23.394
What'd you get?

34:24.145 --> 34:25.855
How is he trying to threaten you?

34:26.731 --> 34:28.858
Well, what did you get from him, Mr. Jeon?

34:31.444 --> 34:32.779
This is going nowhere, so…

34:33.279 --> 34:36.824
Whoever finds him first
tells the other, okay?

34:37.950 --> 34:40.036
Don't you think you'll find him first?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.082
He's your friend, after all.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.208
He's not my friend.

34:48.586 --> 34:49.754
He was my lackey.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.844
Well, I should be going now.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.742
<i>The person</i>
<i>you're trying to reach is not available.</i>

35:19.826 --> 35:21.953
<i>Please record your message after the tone.</i>

35:22.036 --> 35:24.163
Hey, Myeong-o, you son of a bitch.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.333
So, I guess I'm not
the only one that you targeted?

35:29.252 --> 35:31.629
What do you have
to threaten Do-yeong with, huh?

35:33.172 --> 35:34.423
Is it some woman, or…

35:35.550 --> 35:36.551
or something else?

35:39.929 --> 35:44.725
If Ye-sol… is the fucking reason
Do-yeong and I are lumped together,

35:47.228 --> 35:49.689
I'm going to murder you,
you pathetic asshole.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.439
You can check out the bumper,

36:31.522 --> 36:34.275
and then pick up your key
and make your payment in the office.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.485
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

36:52.668 --> 36:56.464
<i>I just realized</i>
<i>that we never properly ended our match.</i>

36:57.548 --> 36:59.342
<i>We haven't counted our houses yet.</i>

38:17.837 --> 38:19.338
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.799
Are you okay?
Is something wrong? Can we help?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.301
Excuse me.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.723
Are you okay, ma'am?

38:43.362 --> 38:44.196
What?

38:46.699 --> 38:47.700
Come inside.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.375
Are you sick? What happened?

38:58.753 --> 38:59.628
Just come in.

39:05.968 --> 39:08.095
I don't have all of my furniture yet.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.515
Uh… let me get you some water.
You can sit here.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.685
What is this place?

39:20.983 --> 39:21.984
What's going on?

39:22.526 --> 39:24.111
Did I reach out at a bad time?

39:26.405 --> 39:27.656
Did you move here?

39:27.740 --> 39:29.241
My friend works out here,

39:29.325 --> 39:32.453
and he's making a ton of money,
so I came out here to practice, too.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.372
At least,
that's what I planned on telling you.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.457
Is it working?

39:39.460 --> 39:40.920
You want to count houses?

39:41.962 --> 39:43.881
I don't want to lose without a reason.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.218
I had a feeling that'd make you come here.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.304
How clever.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.351
You asked me before

39:56.060 --> 39:57.895
about where I'm headed, right?

39:59.522 --> 40:02.316
and the reason why I'm doing all this now.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.195
It's a long story,

40:08.447 --> 40:10.699
and there's really
nothing pleasant about it.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.330
Wanna hear?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.501
<i>There are</i>
<i>white and polar nights,</i>

40:20.584 --> 40:23.337
and my life has been a white night so far.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.715
It's always been bright.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.052
Yeah, of course.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.097
Why are you…?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.474
Wow!

40:37.184 --> 40:38.686
Are you going to a party, Mom?

40:38.769 --> 40:40.813
She's actually going to work.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.399
A super famous fashion awards ceremony.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.067
Wow, that's cool!

40:45.776 --> 40:46.610
Hmm?

40:47.653 --> 40:50.656
I can't wait to be
just like Mom when I grow up.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.742
I'm going to wear
all the pretty necklaces like she does,

40:53.826 --> 40:55.661
and a bunch of pretty dresses too!

41:01.625 --> 41:03.169
I want to try this one.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.503
It's so pretty.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.010
Oh, it's heavy.

41:11.093 --> 41:11.927
Hmm.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.722
Expensive jewelry, expensive watches,

41:14.805 --> 41:18.392
and expensive cars
and handbags are all heavy, you know?

41:19.226 --> 41:22.313
And expensive coats and dresses,

41:22.396 --> 41:23.647
expensive heels,

41:24.982 --> 41:25.983
are all light.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.443
You got it?

41:28.027 --> 41:29.111
I got it, Mom!

41:31.989 --> 41:32.990
Don't worry, Ye-sol.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.913
I'm not going to sink
below the horizon into a polar night…

41:43.250 --> 41:44.793
no matter what happens.

41:54.386 --> 41:55.804
TEST RESULTS
NAME: JEON JAE-JUN

41:55.888 --> 41:57.389
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.999%

41:57.973 --> 41:58.974
No wonder.

42:01.143 --> 42:02.686
That's why she's so cute.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.412
HA YE-SOL

42:22.331 --> 42:23.165
Excuse me.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.125
-Hello, Hye-jeong.
-Mmm.

42:25.626 --> 42:28.045
Someone from Information
left you something.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.257
-Did they find my phone?
-It's pretty thin.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.300
I don't think it's a phone. Here it is.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.594
-It was a rush delivery.
-What?

43:28.647 --> 43:30.316
I'm betting my whole life

43:31.191 --> 43:33.485
on getting revenge on all those people.

43:45.414 --> 43:48.709
So, you're not going… to stop?

43:50.419 --> 43:53.005
You're a better person
than those people, Dong-eun.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.009
I don't care about that.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.137
I get worse every day.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.014
Once you get your revenge,

44:03.724 --> 44:05.184
you will be ruined as well.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.121
I'm jealous of you, Yeo-jeong.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.375
Because your childhood
must have been sweet.

44:29.458 --> 44:31.627
You've grown up,
and you still have dignity.

44:32.586 --> 44:35.714
You can just go live your whole life
spouting cliches.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.637
Have you seen my scars before?

44:48.727 --> 44:49.728
Can you heal them?

44:58.862 --> 45:00.572
How long have you had these scars?

45:09.248 --> 45:10.999
Look at the face you're making now,

45:12.459 --> 45:13.961
after just seeing one arm.

45:15.462 --> 45:18.716
You still want me to stop this?

46:13.145 --> 46:14.980
There were
white nights sometimes,

46:16.190 --> 46:19.401
but most of my nights
felt like a polar night.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.535
They did this…

46:30.829 --> 46:31.830
to you?

46:34.333 --> 46:35.334
Did they?

46:36.502 --> 46:37.753
I'm already ruined.

46:38.545 --> 46:40.255
I have no dignity left.

46:41.465 --> 46:42.591
I need to do this.

46:44.218 --> 46:47.554
I want to stay faithful
to my rage and fury.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.152
I'll do it.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.573
I'll be your executioner.

47:10.744 --> 47:11.954
I'll join the hunt.

47:14.581 --> 47:15.749
Just tell me.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.085
What should I do first?

47:19.044 --> 47:20.212
What do you want next?

47:23.549 --> 47:24.550
Who can I…

47:27.511 --> 47:28.929
kill for you right now?
