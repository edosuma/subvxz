19:55.487 --> 19:57.823
When I first started back in the '70s,

19:57.823 --> 19:59.992
I was the only woman in the room.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.745
Just me and a bunch of

20:55.881 --> 20:58.967

what I was thinking was what if--

21:08.435 --> 21:11.772
it would be funny if
someone was bad at it.

21:11.772 --> 21:17.069
Like maybe Lawrence
who maybe does it in secret

21:17.069 --> 21:21.031

21:22.658 --> 21:23.867
- Oh!

21:24.785 --> 21:27.579
That actually really helps us
because then he'd be too hurt

21:27.579 --> 21:29.623

- Exactly,

21:29.623 --> 21:32.209

that he's a secret ballerina.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.460

- Lawrence as a ballerina
would be pretty funny.
