00:00.173 --> 00:04.006
Do yourself a favor, Higgins.
Call her dad and send her home.

00:05.178 --> 00:07.908
I'm standing here. Hello!

00:07.947 --> 00:09.642
- How many?
- Two.

00:10.516 --> 00:12.507
A band of two villains?

00:12.552 --> 00:14.918
Is there anything else you would like?

00:14.954 --> 00:16.615
Don't do that.

00:16.656 --> 00:19.181
I am not in the mood for a jail term today.

00:19.225 --> 00:21.420
- You were meant to kill me?
- Nothing personal.

00:21.461 --> 00:23.486
- No hard feelings, right?
- Wrong.

00:23.529 --> 00:27.465
Whatever else Sato may have become,
he's not a cold-blooded murderer.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.990
Closer, T.C.

03:09.879 --> 03:12.109
<i>Fate has
a nasty way of popping up</i>

03:12.148 --> 03:15.640
<i>and waggling its long, bony finger
under your nose.</i>

03:15.685 --> 03:18.984
<i>Sometimes it's a squeaker
at 70 miles an hour.</i>

03:19.021 --> 03:23.287
<i>Or a plane you missed that never
makes it back from the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

03:23.326 --> 03:26.955
<i>But whatever it is,
you always get the message.</i>

03:26.996 --> 03:30.523
<i>It's time to stop
taking your good luck for granted.</i>

03:42.878 --> 03:46.245
Morning, Higgins. Guys. Something wrong?

03:46.282 --> 03:49.012
Simply put,
you are not qualified for this work.

03:49.051 --> 03:52.077
Gee, Higgins, I don't think that's very nice.

03:52.121 --> 03:55.989
Look at my rows. They're even, they overlap.
I know how to mow a yard.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.291
To the untrained eye this may appear
to be just another suburban lawn.

04:01.330 --> 04:05.323
But we are standing on
a scientifically formulated carpet of bahia,

04:05.368 --> 04:07.836
Kentucky bluegrass and an African zoysia.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.531
<i>O</i> ne doesn't just mow it.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.403
Gee, Higgins.
I was just trying to do you a favor.

04:13.442 --> 04:18.038
I hope it can be saved. You were cutting
at least 30 degrees against the grain.

04:19.548 --> 04:20.879
Favor?

04:20.916 --> 04:25.512
Well, I figured it was time I paid back
some of the favors that I owe everybody.

04:25.554 --> 04:28.682
Even the score, balance my karma.
You know what I mean?

04:28.724 --> 04:32.660
Assuming you had some grasp
of a subtle Eastern concept like karma...

04:32.695 --> 04:36.654
I'm serious. Make me a list of the favors
I owe you and I'll take care of them.

04:36.699 --> 04:40.658
I already have a list.
What I don't have is a reason to believe you.

04:40.703 --> 04:42.864
You know that case I had?

04:42.905 --> 04:46.466
The guy from Maui who couldn't live
unless I found his wife for him?

04:46.509 --> 04:50.275
I'm not interested in listening
to another of your tawdry divorce cases.

04:50.313 --> 04:52.440
Well, I found her.

04:52.481 --> 04:55.279
In some kootch joint on Hotel Street.

04:56.752 --> 04:58.583
It was a heart-warming reunion.

04:58.621 --> 05:01.385
She had a gun, he had a gun

05:01.424 --> 05:04.188
and I had the hiccups
for six hours after the shooting.

05:04.794 --> 05:10.096
- A case of hiccups is hardly a revelation.
- No, I'm serious, Higgins.

05:10.132 --> 05:13.260
There I was, right between 'em,
and I didn't get a nick.

05:13.302 --> 05:16.032
I think it was some kind of gypsy's warning.

05:17.006 --> 05:21.204
Karma, gypsy warning.
I suppose your horoscope clinched it.

05:21.243 --> 05:23.837
Not my horoscope. This.

05:23.879 --> 05:26.746
Good God, that's horrible. What is it?

05:27.316 --> 05:31.116
It's a fortune cookie from
some takeout Sichuan food after the shooting.

05:31.153 --> 05:33.348
- I thought you had the hiccups.
- Read it.

05:39.695 --> 05:42.562
"A man of good fortune repays his reward."

05:45.034 --> 05:49.835
I agree. That's quite a coincidence.

05:49.872 --> 05:52.170
Magnum, are you serious about this?

05:52.208 --> 05:55.644
It isn't one of your silly attempts
to extract some favor from me?

05:58.647 --> 06:01.275
I swear.

06:01.317 --> 06:04.946
There is an errand you might be
perfectly qualified to perform.

06:07.490 --> 06:08.479
Thank you.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.459
<i>The only time Higgins ever thinks
I'm perfectly qualified for anything</i>

06:15.498 --> 06:17.762
<i>is when the thing is too heavy for him to lift</i>.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.462
<i>He could give me all the dirty jobs
he could think of.</i>

06:20.503 --> 06:22.562
<i>I was still going to keep my promise</i>.

06:22.605 --> 06:26.302
<i>It was time people remembered
they can trust Thomas Sullivan Magnum.</i>

06:26.342 --> 06:27.832
You don't trust me?

06:27.877 --> 06:31.813
Me not trust a man who carries around
a fortune cookie in his pocket?

06:31.847 --> 06:34.907
I'm serious, T.C.
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

06:36.385 --> 06:38.785
Which is why you need to borrow my van.

06:38.821 --> 06:43.520
No. You can't very well carry around
a 200-pound crate in a Ferrari, can you?

06:43.559 --> 06:48.019
Besides, I've got to finish this favor
for Higgins before I can do one for you.

06:48.564 --> 06:51.328
Think of everything
you want done around here.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.427
Make up a list of the gas bills I owe you.

06:55.137 --> 06:57.128
It's already made up.

06:57.173 --> 06:59.664
I'll wash it and wax it before I bring it back.

06:59.708 --> 07:03.303
I'll clean out those hamburger bags
and beer cans in the back.

07:03.345 --> 07:06.337
That's great, considering they're all yours.

07:09.485 --> 07:12.977
- I'll be your driver.
- My what?

07:13.022 --> 07:16.651
Your chauffeur for a day
in exchange for the van.

07:17.426 --> 07:19.724
- Will you wear a uniform?
- Don't push it.

07:19.762 --> 07:22.390
- The keys are in the van.
- Ha!

07:22.431 --> 07:26.527
- You won't regret this, T.C.
- Somehow I regret it already.

07:30.239 --> 07:33.106
<i>Mr. Akiola, come to receiving</i>.

07:42.985 --> 07:45.545
<i>Max, into the office on the double</i>.

07:47.857 --> 07:49.848
A little help?

07:52.761 --> 07:55.059
I could use a hand, somebody.

07:59.902 --> 08:02.735
<i>Get me a forklift on aisle 14</i>.

08:02.771 --> 08:04.762
Hello?

08:17.419 --> 08:19.353
Hey! Hey!

08:21.490 --> 08:23.515
- Hey!
- Hey.

08:25.561 --> 08:29.520
Hey. No riders, bro. Union rules.

08:29.565 --> 08:32.591
Not funny. I could have slipped.
Did you ever think of that?

08:32.635 --> 08:35.433
<i>Aisle 23, you're slowing up</i>.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.732
I've seen it happen.

08:36.772 --> 08:39.969
The warehouse is dangerous.
That's why guys like you stay out.

08:40.009 --> 08:42.169
Union rules.

08:42.211 --> 08:44.202
What is this?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.246
<i>O</i> ne crate of books from off the Boku Maru.

08:47.283 --> 08:49.581
That's right. That's the entry form. No duty.

08:51.387 --> 08:54.413
- Must be here someplace.
- Could you get it for me, please?

08:55.457 --> 08:57.618
You want me to get it?

08:58.561 --> 08:59.960
<i>O</i> K.

09:00.629 --> 09:04.190
<i>One brace to the loading dock.
Stack 'em on dock six.</i>

09:09.104 --> 09:11.470
<i>We need a supervisor in aisle 14</i>.

09:17.112 --> 09:18.602
My van's over there.

09:18.647 --> 09:21.810
Sorry. I can't take it past that line.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.681
- Union...
- Don't say it.

09:23.719 --> 09:26.119
Rules, bro.

09:33.896 --> 09:36.421
<i>Stanley, report to personnel right away</i>.

09:52.915 --> 09:55.782
- Where did you come from?
- In here.

10:03.158 --> 10:06.719
<i>O</i> K, son, you wanna tell me
what you were doing in that crate?

10:09.798 --> 10:12.733
- Hi, guys.
- Why don't you take a hike?

10:12.768 --> 10:14.429
- We'll take the kid.
- Wait.

10:14.470 --> 10:17.098
Hold it till somebody tells me
what's going on.

10:17.139 --> 10:19.198
We already told you once.

10:19.241 --> 10:21.937
- Please...
- Go on, get going.

10:23.712 --> 10:25.145
Wasn't very smart.

10:25.180 --> 10:28.445
Well, you know, sometimes
I get an impulse. I gotta go with it.

10:28.484 --> 10:30.918
Go with this.

11:10.693 --> 11:12.684
Don't be afraid. They're gone.

11:15.864 --> 11:17.855
Thank you, Higgins-san.

11:19.334 --> 11:20.801
Higgins-san?

11:21.570 --> 11:23.561
Yeah.

11:27.574 --> 11:31.635
I should have known better than
to believe you could manage responsibility

11:31.678 --> 11:33.669
for more than a few heartbeats.

11:33.714 --> 11:36.148
After two hours I gave up hope. After three...

11:36.183 --> 11:38.413
Relax, Higgins. I got your package.

11:38.452 --> 11:40.477
Before or after the barroom brawl?

11:40.520 --> 11:42.818
There wasn't any barroom brawl.

11:42.856 --> 11:45.324
Not exactly. Two men attacked me.

11:45.359 --> 11:50.092
Two men attacked you?
I trust the books arrived in good condition.

11:50.130 --> 11:51.290
Not exactly.

11:51.331 --> 11:54.562
- You're being intentionally obtuse.
- <i>O</i> btuse?

11:54.601 --> 11:56.728
- Vague.
- I know what it means!

11:56.770 --> 11:59.796
Why would two men suddenly attack you
over a crate of books?

11:59.840 --> 12:03.276
Maybe because
there weren't any books in it. Just her.

12:07.914 --> 12:09.745
This is Higgins-san.

12:18.558 --> 12:21.550
- I am Asani <i>O</i> zawa.
- I don't care who...

12:23.096 --> 12:25.929
- <i>O</i> zawa?
- Hai.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.028
Sato <i>O</i> zawa's daughter?

12:30.771 --> 12:32.068
Hai.

12:33.106 --> 12:35.097
Good Lord.

12:35.142 --> 12:38.509
I was aboard the freighter to Hawaii
for three weeks.

12:38.545 --> 12:42.504
- You were in that crate for three weeks?
- Not all the time.

12:42.549 --> 12:47.282
I paid some of the sailors to help me
and bring me food.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.379
They placed my crate where I had good air

12:49.423 --> 12:52.756
and I only had to stay inside
when the watch would change.

12:52.793 --> 12:58.322
Harrowing ordeal. I still can't believe
your father would keep you a virtual prisoner.

12:58.365 --> 13:00.959
Sato is a rigid man but not cruel.

13:01.001 --> 13:07.497
The pearls have changed him. He has
too much power for one man and he is old.

13:07.541 --> 13:09.702
He understands only the old way.

13:09.743 --> 13:11.734
He forbade me to marry an American

13:11.778 --> 13:15.407
and when I disobeyed
he drove my husband away with threats.

13:15.449 --> 13:20.148
From that moment
he could only think of me as mura hachibu.

13:20.854 --> 13:22.185
Which means?

13:22.222 --> 13:27.159
The words mean only to go to the eighth part
of the village where no one goes.

13:27.194 --> 13:29.185
But it is more.

13:29.229 --> 13:34.792
Mura hachibu is an extreme form
of social censure, a mental banishment.

13:34.835 --> 13:37.736
Although you live and work
among other people

13:37.771 --> 13:40.569
you are invisible, you don't exist.

13:40.607 --> 13:46.273
That is true. I could not bear it
so I posed as a pearl diver and escaped.

13:46.313 --> 13:49.146
Now I am free but I am in shame.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.908
Sato is the one to be ashamed.

13:54.221 --> 13:58.954
- What is your husband's name?
- Roy. Roy Chambers.

13:59.726 --> 14:03.218
He eluded my father
and sent money for my escape to Honolulu.

14:04.364 --> 14:06.355
So why involve Higgins in all this?

14:08.068 --> 14:12.004
My father has many allies.
They are certainly looking for me.

14:12.038 --> 14:14.302
Yo-yos at the dock.

14:14.341 --> 14:17.276
Despite all my care,
somehow they found me.

14:18.178 --> 14:21.409
You see why I could not risk
having Roy pick up the crate.

14:22.449 --> 14:27.079
But it has been said in my family
that Higgins-san is a man of honor

14:27.120 --> 14:29.680
who could be trusted.

14:29.723 --> 14:34.751
I am deeply touched.
You can have complete faith in our help.

14:34.795 --> 14:37.855
Forget it, Higgins.
You're not volunteering me for this.

14:37.898 --> 14:42.335
Magnum, can't you feel for this girl?
Don't you have any sympathy for her plight?

14:42.369 --> 14:45.861
Do yourself a favor, Higgins.
Call her dad and send her home.

14:45.906 --> 14:48.704
That would be unthinkable. She trusts me.

14:48.742 --> 14:51.438
So I heard. Take my advice. Do it anyway.

14:51.478 --> 14:55.107
I can think of about eight laws
we're breaking by letting her sit there.

14:55.148 --> 15:00.017
Incidentally, she has not been in the hold
of a Japanese freighter for three weeks.

15:00.053 --> 15:01.418
How do you know that?

15:01.454 --> 15:03.922
Even a cherry blossom wilts
after three weeks.

15:12.432 --> 15:14.923
I've considered our arrangement.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.201
What amusing workmanship.

15:19.239 --> 15:22.174
- I suppose you can do better.
- <i>O</i> f course.

15:22.209 --> 15:25.235
I put in a few turns as a batman, you know.

15:31.718 --> 15:36.382
Higgins, I am not going to help you
with Little Miss Cherry Blossom.

15:37.557 --> 15:41.493
Asani has been giving me
the most frightful account of her dilemma.

15:41.528 --> 15:46.022
Her father had her under guard
night and day on some godforsaken atoll.

15:46.066 --> 15:49.092
Refused to acknowledge her marriage.

15:49.135 --> 15:51.729
Nice guy, this friend of yours.

15:51.771 --> 15:55.434
I would have sworn that Sato
was incapable of such behavior.

15:55.475 --> 16:00.242
We have a bond dating back...
good heavens, nearly 40 years.

16:01.715 --> 16:04.548
I can only conclude
that time has changed him.

16:04.584 --> 16:09.851
Still, I owe him this much,
to see that his daughter is safe and happy.

16:10.490 --> 16:12.151
Higgins, send her home.

16:12.192 --> 16:14.854
Which means
taking her back to her husband.

16:14.895 --> 16:17.386
Straightforward
under normal circumstances.

16:17.430 --> 16:20.297
Nothing about any of this is normal.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.268
- She jumped out of a crate.
- Unorthodox, I admit.

16:23.303 --> 16:28.468
And then the yo-yos at that moment
just happened to show up to jump you, not me.

16:30.543 --> 16:32.807
I'm not admitting you're right but I concede

16:32.846 --> 16:35.212
the prudent thing might be
to leave Asani here

16:35.248 --> 16:37.409
and bring her husband back to Robin's Nest.

16:37.450 --> 16:40.886
- It's still dangerous.
- Precisely why I'm asking for your help.

16:40.921 --> 16:43.185
No.

16:43.957 --> 16:47.324
<i>I understood Asani was the product
of an ancient, genteel culture</i>

16:47.360 --> 16:52.161
<i>but I was a little surprised when
she hesitated to help me locate her husband.</i>

16:52.198 --> 16:56.601
<i>She said she was in my debt and wanted
to keep me from getting hurt again,</i>

16:56.636 --> 17:01.869
<i>but out of deference to Higgins I insisted
and finally she gave me his address.</i>

17:02.509 --> 17:07.878
<i>Only before picking up Roy, the new
Magnum had another debt to take care of.</i>

17:08.515 --> 17:09.675
Thanks, Keoki.

17:09.715 --> 17:11.877
Thomas, I want to shake your hand.

17:11.917 --> 17:14.614
For once you made a promise
and lived up to it.

17:14.654 --> 17:16.952
- Right on time too.
- Don't overdo it.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.652
It's positive reinforcement, my boy.

17:19.693 --> 17:21.819
I want this to be a pleasant experience.

17:21.861 --> 17:24.921
- This looks like a lot of work.
- And it's just from today.

17:25.765 --> 17:29.166
- These bar bills?
- Yep. Every one hot off a credit card.

17:29.202 --> 17:31.762
Although I hope it's not a hot credit card.

17:32.472 --> 17:35.873
Where's your sense of humor?
Sit down, I'll show you the ropes.

17:35.909 --> 17:39.777
You couldn't have picked a better time
to start paying back favors.

17:39.813 --> 17:41.872
My book-keeper just quit.

17:41.915 --> 17:45.681
- Why are these things all wet?
- I just told you, they're bar bills.

17:45.719 --> 17:50.122
- You are gonna do this for me, aren't you?
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

17:50.156 --> 17:54.115
You didn't happen to check on those
two guys who knocked me round the docks?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.526
Thomas, you just asked me that
an hour ago.

17:56.563 --> 18:00.465
Let me get started with you
and I'll make a few calls for you.

18:00.500 --> 18:05.767
This is either a huge bar tab or a girl's
phone number. I can't read any of these.

18:05.805 --> 18:09.206
They're signed by the same drunks
who spilled their drinks on them.

18:09.242 --> 18:12.507
- Are you gonna dilly-dally or help me?
- Absolutely.

18:12.545 --> 18:15.639
What's the hold-up? I got places to go.

18:15.682 --> 18:18.344
- What's he talking about?
- It's complicated.

18:18.385 --> 18:21.912
I had to ask T.C. a favor
in order to repay a favor to Higgins.

18:21.955 --> 18:24.480
Now I'm paying back T.C., but I'll get to you.

18:24.524 --> 18:26.014
What's he talking about?

18:26.059 --> 18:29.927
He is my chauffeur.
He has to drive me any place I wanna go.

18:29.963 --> 18:32.989
No. He's my book-keeper
and I got a ton of work for him.

18:33.033 --> 18:36.298
I'll get to everybody in due time.
In due time, Rick.

18:36.336 --> 18:38.964
Check on those two guys for me, will you?

18:39.005 --> 18:41.769
That'll cost you 30 minutes
on the adding machine.

18:41.808 --> 18:44.368
- Just put it on my tab.
- It's already put.

18:44.411 --> 18:46.641
Rick, I almost forgot your paper.

18:46.679 --> 18:47.976
<i>O</i> h, no!

18:49.049 --> 18:51.040
I'm sorry.

18:53.153 --> 18:56.020
I should have known
this "my driver" deal was a con.

18:56.056 --> 18:58.524
- I drove you, didn't I?
- Where you wanted to go.

18:58.558 --> 19:02.289
Relax, T.C.
We'll just pick this guy up and leave.

19:02.328 --> 19:05.525
<i>O</i> h, yeah? Ha!
If it's so easy, why am I here?

19:24.818 --> 19:27.082
Don't do that.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.111
Don't do... Look, I...

19:29.155 --> 19:32.022
I am not in the mood for a jail term today.

19:32.058 --> 19:36.620
He's supposed to be in here.
I just wanna find out why he isn't.

19:36.663 --> 19:41.566
If you get me busted for a B and E,
it'll cost you more than a day of chauffeuring.

19:41.601 --> 19:43.899
I just want you to know that.

19:51.044 --> 19:53.035
Check the kitchen.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.291
He's not in there.

20:16.336 --> 20:20.295
- This guy sure must travel light.
- Nobody travels that light.

20:27.881 --> 20:31.339
- Er... Thomas.
- I knew something was screwball.

20:34.721 --> 20:37.554
What do you want?
There's nothing here to steal.

20:37.590 --> 20:40.184
Unless you're funny for Formica.

20:40.226 --> 20:43.218
- Well...
- Actually, um...

20:44.998 --> 20:46.829
Did you want to rent the place?

20:48.368 --> 20:51.701
That's it. A one, maybe two-bedroom.
Nothing fancy.

20:51.738 --> 20:54.798
Wouldn't the fern look lovely
in the corner over there?

20:54.841 --> 20:58.436
You should have asked to see it first.
It might have been taken.

20:58.478 --> 21:02.505
My place is right downstairs.
It says manager on the door.

21:02.549 --> 21:06.007
That's me. I'm Mrs. Cheever.

21:06.052 --> 21:08.452
Well, it's nice to meet you.

21:08.488 --> 21:12.288
This place is just dandy too.
We're surprised it's not already taken.

21:12.325 --> 21:15.158
We thought a friend of ours
might have snatched it up.

21:15.195 --> 21:18.187
- Ray Chambers?
- You mean Roy Chambers.

21:19.165 --> 21:22.532
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen Roy for a few days.

21:23.970 --> 21:29.237
Now, we get first and last months',
plus security, plus...

21:29.275 --> 21:31.573
We'll take it. We'll take it.

21:34.614 --> 21:38.744
I'm confident we've encountered
a double-blind strategy. I've used it myself.

21:38.785 --> 21:40.776
Chambers is waiting elsewhere.

21:40.820 --> 21:46.918
Then why didn't that landlady come up with
another address or a secret handshake?

21:46.960 --> 21:50.054
She was instructed
to reveal what she knew only to Asani.

21:50.096 --> 21:53.293
Chambers might have been waiting
somewhere nearby.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.597
I say Asani and I go back there now.

21:55.635 --> 21:58.263
No, you don't, Higgins. It could be a trap.

21:58.304 --> 22:02.172
I told you, he may have moved
to elude my father's men.

22:02.909 --> 22:05.639
But I am worried
they may have found him already.

22:05.678 --> 22:08.579
The landlady merely said
she hadn't seen him.

22:08.615 --> 22:12.142
Forget what she said.
That whole setup was cockeyed.

22:12.185 --> 22:16.952
I got to go back to the docks where we know
there's two guys with something to tell us.

22:17.890 --> 22:20.916
- It is too dangerous.
- My dear, that's what we pay him for.

22:22.528 --> 22:23.688
Pay me?

22:25.098 --> 22:26.429
A figure of speech.

22:31.504 --> 22:36.305
<i>It was worth remembering that what got me
into this whole thing was a fortune cookie.</i>

22:36.342 --> 22:39.004
<i>Unfortunately they don't come
with instructions.</i>

22:39.045 --> 22:44.142
<i>No matter what they say, you have to figure
out what they really mean on your own.</i>

22:44.183 --> 22:46.674
<i>Which was still the way I felt about Asani</i>.

22:49.422 --> 22:51.413
Anybody here?

22:52.759 --> 22:56.251
<i>There's only one problem
with asking people questions on the docks.</i>

22:56.296 --> 22:58.856
<i>If they don't know you, they won't tell you</i>.

22:58.898 --> 23:01.264
<i>No good pointing out that if they knew you,</i>

23:01.301 --> 23:04.498
<i>chances are you'd know what they know
in the first place.</i>

23:04.537 --> 23:07.665
<i>They already know that and they don't care</i>.

23:07.707 --> 23:11.268
<i>The thing I wanted to ask those two thugs,
if I could ever find them,</i>

23:11.311 --> 23:13.336
<i>was who or what frightened them off</i>.

23:13.379 --> 23:17.839
<i>I like to think I can handle myself
but so far things hadn't been very tricky.</i>

23:30.029 --> 23:32.497
Help! Help! Anybody!

23:36.502 --> 23:38.493
I'm slipping!

23:50.064 --> 23:52.191
It was 1942, summer.

23:52.233 --> 23:55.202
I'd been transferred from North Africa
to New Guinea

23:55.236 --> 23:58.205
and attached
to the Australian Seventh Division.

23:58.239 --> 24:01.174
We were to push the enemy back
across the island,

24:01.208 --> 24:03.972
across a spine of mountains.

24:04.778 --> 24:08.111
100 miles in that terrible jungle.

24:08.148 --> 24:11.515
We called it the Kokoda Trail.
Ever heard of it?

24:12.753 --> 24:17.918
I have heard of the battles
for <i>O</i> kinawa and Saipan and Iwo Jima

24:17.958 --> 24:20.051
but never this Kokoda Trail.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.952
A place worth forgetting.

24:22.997 --> 24:25.465
It could rain an inch in five minutes.

24:25.499 --> 24:29.060
The mud was black, full of disease,

24:29.103 --> 24:32.732
and of course we were killing each other.

24:34.208 --> 24:36.301
Your father's men and my men.

24:36.343 --> 24:40.074
After six months we were all starving. Malaria.

24:41.248 --> 24:43.079
My platoon had been lost for a day

24:43.117 --> 24:47.144
when we stumbled across your father's squad
lying in a stand of kuani grass.

24:48.422 --> 24:51.220
Those who were still alive
were without ammunition.

24:51.258 --> 24:53.249
So were we.

24:53.294 --> 24:56.491
And... too weak even to use our bayonets.

24:58.532 --> 25:01.660
<i>O</i> r at least, we didn't.

25:04.104 --> 25:09.007
We had some rations to spare
and they had quinine for our fevers.

25:10.811 --> 25:16.044
That whole day, your father and I
did not exchange a single word.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.884
<i>O</i> ne day of reason
among so many of madness.

25:20.788 --> 25:24.383
I understand now
why he says he owes his life to you.

25:25.125 --> 25:27.059
And I to him.

25:32.166 --> 25:35.499
After the war I found him
in one of our prisoner camps.

25:36.403 --> 25:40.237
We talked then
and we have written over the years.

25:40.274 --> 25:45.211
We have never once yet spoken
of that day on the Kokoda Trail.

25:46.647 --> 25:50.811
Perhaps because he cannot bear the guilt
of squandering the new life you gave him.

25:51.785 --> 25:56.154
I would hardly say that. He's
an enormously wealthy and influential man.

25:57.691 --> 26:00.717
Yes. He has wealth and influence.

26:02.396 --> 26:04.455
But he no longer has the soul of a man.

26:05.499 --> 26:07.626
You're too harsh.

26:07.668 --> 26:12.867
Sato is capable of great understanding
and sympathy. I'm living proof of that.

26:12.906 --> 26:17.639
That's a very nice story, Higgins, but
you're letting all this nice food go to waste.

26:17.678 --> 26:21.614
Magnum, when will you learn the meaning of
the simple phrase "on time"?

26:21.649 --> 26:25.983
I'm sorry,
but I've been wrestling with my karma.

26:26.020 --> 26:30.616
I'm beginning to think it's so far out of whack
that I'll never get it right.

26:32.493 --> 26:35.826
- Did you find out about Roy?
- No.

26:35.863 --> 26:38.661
All I got was a sore shoulder
and a torn shirt.

26:38.699 --> 26:40.667
How did this happen?

26:41.802 --> 26:46.933
Your understanding and sympathetic friend
tried to have me killed on the dock.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.434
That just doesn't sound like Sato.

26:50.477 --> 26:54.345
That was a long time ago.
You've certainly changed. Maybe he has too.

26:54.381 --> 26:59.546
Whatever else Sato may have become,
he's not a murderer. I will never believe that.

27:00.854 --> 27:03.152
You must believe, Higgins-san.

27:05.059 --> 27:06.390
It could be true.

27:15.703 --> 27:19.230
<i>I woke up remembering an oriental curse</i>.

27:19.273 --> 27:22.436
<i>May you live in interesting times</i>.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.467
<i>I must have been thinking about Asani</i>.

27:24.511 --> 27:28.140
<i>She was a puzzle inside a riddle
tied up with a question mark.</i>

27:28.182 --> 27:31.117
<i>She said she'd come in a crate
but she probably hadn't.</i>

27:31.151 --> 27:33.585
<i>She said she had a husband
but maybe she didn't.</i>

27:33.620 --> 27:35.815
<i>Guys were after her but she got away</i>.

27:35.856 --> 27:40.919
<i>And then they tried to kill me. And that
was getting just a little too interesting.</i>

27:57.010 --> 28:00.912
- You cleaned up my place.
- I hope you are pleased.

28:00.948 --> 28:04.941
It is not much but it is something I can do
to repay your generosity.

28:04.985 --> 28:06.976
You didn't have to.

28:07.020 --> 28:10.547
I heard you speak last night of karma.

28:10.591 --> 28:13.458
I too share that belief,

28:13.494 --> 28:16.327
and as you have risked your life for me,

28:16.363 --> 28:18.354
I am in your debt.

28:19.967 --> 28:24.370
- I have mended your shirts and pants.
- Thank you.

28:24.404 --> 28:28.306
- I am afraid the pants will never be perfect.
- <i>O</i> h, that's <i>O</i> K.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.867
Batman Higgins got to 'em first.

28:33.847 --> 28:35.838
Excuse me.

28:38.485 --> 28:41.511
Hello. Morning, Rick. You got something?

28:42.589 --> 28:45.114
Great. I think
we should have a talk with them.

28:45.159 --> 28:48.060
You and T.C. hold on.
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

28:52.833 --> 28:58.567
Nothing on Roy but my friend thinks he's got
a line on our reception committee yesterday.

28:58.605 --> 29:03.201
I have made a bath for your shoulder.
And I will bring you some tea.

29:06.847 --> 29:09.145
Is there anything else you would like?

29:10.818 --> 29:15.721
- I said I think we're getting close to finding...
- I cannot ask you to do more in my behalf.

29:17.658 --> 29:19.751
There is no need to go.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.858
All of our actions have been futile

29:23.897 --> 29:26.092
so it is clearly now the time to wait.

29:30.003 --> 29:32.233
In Japanese we have a saying.

29:36.343 --> 29:39.073
Destiny is destiny.

29:39.913 --> 29:41.904
I have a saying for you.

29:43.684 --> 29:46.084
Ever hear of upping the ante?

29:47.054 --> 29:48.885
Well, it's like in poker.

29:48.922 --> 29:52.085
Yesterday somebody tried
to bluff me out of the game.

29:53.627 --> 29:55.720
But all I really did was raise the stakes.

29:56.730 --> 29:58.925
I do not know this poker.

30:02.703 --> 30:05.263
You may not know the card game but...

30:07.274 --> 30:09.333
I think you know how to play.

30:21.221 --> 30:23.917
You'd better give up
on this payback routine.

30:23.957 --> 30:26.790
You'll dig yourself in so deep
you'll never get out.

30:26.827 --> 30:29.125
Come on. These things run in cycles.

30:29.162 --> 30:33.292
Just bear with me.
Right now I'm in the "I need a favor" phase.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.324
Another favor.

30:35.369 --> 30:37.735
No word at all on Roy Chambers?

30:37.771 --> 30:41.172
No, sir, I didn't hear zip on that guy.
He must be extra clean.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.506
But these two, they were easy.

30:43.543 --> 30:48.344
Strictly low-rent knuckle-busters.
Cash-and-carry-you-away types.

30:48.382 --> 30:50.373
Well...

30:55.923 --> 30:59.290
I think we ought to have our discussion
with these guys in private.

31:05.565 --> 31:07.658
Give us about 20 seconds.

31:18.879 --> 31:20.540
Hi, guys.

31:22.316 --> 31:24.477
<i>O</i> ops. Scratch.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.778
<i>O</i> h...

31:28.822 --> 31:32.758
I know. I know
I should have waited till after your shot

31:32.793 --> 31:36.889
but, like I said, I get those impulses.

31:36.930 --> 31:40.661
You know what? I think you're gonna be sorry
you got this one.

31:40.701 --> 31:43.033
What, you don't wanna play?

31:43.070 --> 31:45.834
I thought we might play nine-ball
for a round of beers.

31:45.872 --> 31:49.205
- Did you?
- Well, we're tired of playing nine-ball.

31:49.242 --> 31:51.767
I wonder what else
we could use these sticks for.

31:51.812 --> 31:53.803
Rotation?

31:55.315 --> 31:57.306
Eight-ball?

31:58.919 --> 32:01.945
Hold that right there.
Gentlemen, don't make us use these.

32:01.989 --> 32:04.423
Yeah, I like to try and avoid loud noises.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.454
Move it. Come on, move it.

32:07.494 --> 32:11.225
- Careful. My friend has itchy trigger fingers.
- Move it.

32:12.966 --> 32:18.063
Thomas, I don't think you've been properly
introduced. Mr. Jansen and Mr. Harms.

32:18.105 --> 32:19.936
<i>O</i> h.

32:19.973 --> 32:21.941
We were deciding what game to play.

32:21.975 --> 32:23.966
How about 20 Questions? I'll start.

32:24.011 --> 32:28.448
First question.
Does the name Sato <i>O</i> zawa ring a bell?

32:31.118 --> 32:32.881
What about Roy Chambers?

32:32.919 --> 32:37.288
We don't know those names. We get
a phone call and some cash in an envelope.

32:37.324 --> 32:39.656
The first time it wasn't supposed to be you.

32:40.527 --> 32:43.860
- An English guy, Higgins.
- Yeah, it was supposed to be Higgins.

32:43.897 --> 32:46.730
Same number, ask for the girl,
rough you up, then split.

32:46.767 --> 32:49.964
- What about at the docks? The container.
- Another phone call.

32:52.072 --> 32:55.974
- You were supposed to kill me?
- Nothing personal. Doing our job.

32:56.009 --> 32:58.842
- So no hard feelings, right?
- Wrong.

32:59.379 --> 33:00.846
Everything <i>O</i> K?

33:02.716 --> 33:05.685
Uh... It was.

33:08.055 --> 33:12.492
- It is now.
- No, it's not. You still owe me 30 bucks.

33:12.526 --> 33:16.724
Yeah, and what about the 30
you guys owe me? I want it now.

33:16.763 --> 33:19.698
This is about the worst hustle
I've ever been in on.

33:19.733 --> 33:22.531
Hustle? Hustle! Yeah, that's it.

33:22.569 --> 33:25.231
We're never gonna work
with you guys again.

33:25.272 --> 33:28.833
You're supposed to have these guys
set up for us and what do you do?

33:28.875 --> 33:31.105
You shake down these clowns yourself.

33:31.144 --> 33:32.975
- Yeah.
- That's low.

33:33.013 --> 33:35.538
Yeah, who can you trust nowadays?

33:50.130 --> 33:54.089
<i>These things are supposed to get simpler
once you start finding things out.</i>

33:54.134 --> 33:56.193
<i>I say supposed to</i>.

33:56.236 --> 34:01.196
<i>But who would spend good money to
hire two guys for a game of bump and run,</i>

34:01.241 --> 34:03.835
<i>then hire them again to bump me off?</i>

34:03.877 --> 34:08.074
<i>Not Sato Ozawa. All he was supposed
to want was his daughter back.</i>

34:08.114 --> 34:09.980
<i>I say supposed to</i>.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.715
Hey, I found the guy...

34:14.987 --> 34:16.649
<i>O</i> h...

34:16.690 --> 34:19.591
That is getting desperate.

34:19.626 --> 34:25.326
I think pouring the stuff straight into your brain
is one of the seven danger signals.

34:25.364 --> 34:28.357
I'm holding you responsible,
criminally responsible,

34:28.400 --> 34:31.962
for allowing the security of this estate
to lapse into such disrepair

34:32.005 --> 34:35.235
that a band of villains could waltz in here,
bash me on the skull

34:35.275 --> 34:38.402
and spirit that girl away
without so much as a buzzer buzzing.

34:38.445 --> 34:41.539
- Asani's been kidnapped?
- Indeed. An hour ago, no more.

34:41.581 --> 34:45.039
My pride is far more battered than my flesh.

34:45.085 --> 34:48.953
I've allowed Sato's daughter
to be forcibly taken from my safekeeping.

34:48.989 --> 34:52.219
I repeat, you have failed
in your duties as chief of security.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.817
<i>O</i> h?

34:53.860 --> 34:57.296
What about the lads?
The good old trustworthy infallible lads.

34:57.330 --> 35:00.299
They must have got a chunk of somebody. No?

35:01.168 --> 35:05.332
This is no time for recriminations.
We must follow their demands to the letter.

35:05.372 --> 35:07.806
From the look of them
they were deadly serious.

35:07.841 --> 35:11.299
- You got a look? That's good. How many?
- Two.

35:12.345 --> 35:14.210
A band of two villains?

35:14.247 --> 35:17.011
Sufficient for the job
when a man has no warning.

35:17.050 --> 35:18.540
An agate-eyed oriental

35:18.585 --> 35:22.646
and a looming barrel-chested
lumberjacket type with a matted beard.

35:23.857 --> 35:26.826
- Which one hit you?
- What does it matter?

35:30.764 --> 35:33.995
They have Asani. All we can do is wait.

35:35.268 --> 35:37.736
They want Sato here
to negotiate for her.

35:37.771 --> 35:40.069
That's something. You were right about him.

35:40.106 --> 35:44.270
Sato is as much a victim as anyone else.
I was confident that would be the case.

35:44.311 --> 35:46.438
You call him? That's nasty.

35:47.581 --> 35:51.745
I've already spoken to Sato. He heard the story
and said my word was good enough.

35:51.785 --> 35:54.618
- He's flying in immediately.
- Cheer up.

35:54.654 --> 35:56.781
I feel a great sense of failure.

35:56.823 --> 35:59.724
No. There's time.
Maybe we can find her for him by then.

35:59.759 --> 36:03.354
We will do nothing of the kind.
Their demands were quite specific.

36:03.396 --> 36:05.227
No police, no interference.

36:05.265 --> 36:08.928
We will wait. Check the security system
and do nothing but wait.

36:08.969 --> 36:11.233
Is that clear?

36:13.607 --> 36:16.167
OK. You got it.

36:19.546 --> 36:22.276
We'll wait. Do nothing.

36:26.353 --> 36:30.551
<i>It took me five minutes to find where the
kidnappers had jumped the alarm circuits.</i>

36:30.590 --> 36:33.582
<i>Neat job, too.
Five more minutes and they were fixed.</i>

36:33.627 --> 36:38.428
<i>Then what was I gonna do? I couldn't just
sit there with all the pieces but no puzzle.</i>

36:38.465 --> 36:41.195
<i>I needed something concrete to go on</i>.

36:41.234 --> 36:43.566
<i>Or maybe someone on concrete</i>.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.041
You see him?

36:52.078 --> 36:54.069
<i>Yeah, I see him</i>.

37:02.622 --> 37:05.056
Give me the juice up.
I got a string on this boy.

37:31.078 --> 37:34.411
<i>He's headed toward Diamond Head
on Kalakaua, Thomas.</i>

37:34.454 --> 37:36.445
<i>It's got to be the zoo</i>.

38:41.187 --> 38:42.848
Hold it. Hold it right there.

38:42.889 --> 38:45.517
Just hold it.
I just wanna ask you a few questions.

38:45.558 --> 38:47.617
Don't touch him. Leave him alone.

38:47.660 --> 38:51.061
Honey... honey, it's all right. It's all right.

38:51.097 --> 38:54.498
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Let's start with you.

38:54.534 --> 38:57.230
Since you're the only guy
following me around,

38:57.270 --> 39:00.603
you probably already know who I am,
right, Ray... Roy?

39:00.640 --> 39:02.801
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

39:03.042 --> 39:07.741
You're here visiting the animals
while somebody kidnaps your wife.

39:07.780 --> 39:11.238
- What are you talking about?
- Asani. Someone kidnapped Asani.

39:11.284 --> 39:14.515
I don't understand. I am Asani.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.421
We thought you were working for Sato.

39:28.466 --> 39:33.529
I paid the man at the warehouse to call me
if anyone asked questions about Asani and I.

39:33.571 --> 39:36.005
- He helped you out before?
- That's right.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.702
I really did arrive
at that same warehouse in a crate

39:38.743 --> 39:41.268
only a week before you picked up my sister.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.542
- Your sister?
- Mioshi.

39:43.581 --> 39:45.845
My older sister by one year.

39:45.883 --> 39:50.343
- And a pretty good copy of you too.
- I'm sure she's the best copy she can be.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.482
Down to pretending to get to Hawaii
the same way Asani did.

39:53.524 --> 39:56.823
Physically we are alike
but we are much different people.

39:56.861 --> 40:00.820
She's more like my father. She needs power
and she knows how to get it.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.355
And how to use it.

40:02.400 --> 40:07.337
But why is it important for Mioshi
to make Higgins believe she was you?

40:07.371 --> 40:09.430
The illusion had to be perfect.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.464
Sato knows how Asani escaped

40:11.509 --> 40:14.967
so Higgins has to believe the same thing
in case they compare notes.

40:15.012 --> 40:18.004
- What's the point?
- <i>O</i> nce my father was strong.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.244
But now he is a frightened man.

40:20.284 --> 40:23.253
He's growing old
and feels vulnerable to his enemies.

40:23.287 --> 40:27.451
They are just as heartless as my sister
and they want his pearl beds.

40:27.491 --> 40:30.790
You see, Sato hasn't left his walls
or his guards for years.

40:30.828 --> 40:33.888
He thinks if he does he'll be killed.
He's probably right.

40:33.931 --> 40:38.265
There's only one man in this world he might
trust enough to persuade him to come out.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.963
- Higgins.
- Yes.

40:40.004 --> 40:43.201
If Higgins-san calls
believing there's a plot to kidnap me...

40:43.240 --> 40:46.073
He already did.
Your father's on his way to Hawaii.

40:46.110 --> 40:50.240
- Mioshi's going to kill him.
- I can't get through. I gotta get out there.

41:38.629 --> 41:42.463
Konnichiwa, Sato. Welcome to Hawaii.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.061
Hello, Jonathan.
It has been far too many years.

41:47.204 --> 41:52.005
I wish this reunion were for any reason other
than the one which has brought you here.

41:52.610 --> 41:57.343
- My regret is overwhelming.
- Please, no speeches of regret.

41:57.381 --> 42:03.149
The blame is all mine.
Later, if we wish, we may indulge in guilt.

42:03.187 --> 42:09.353
But first we must find my daughter
and for that I am dependent upon your help.

42:09.393 --> 42:12.658
You have that, of course.
Whatever I can do.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.358
For now, you can give me grace to wait.

42:15.399 --> 42:18.163
- Have you heard from the kidnappers?
- No.

42:18.202 --> 42:22.935
Their note said that we would be contacted.
We don't know precisely when.

42:24.408 --> 42:25.568
Asani?

42:33.884 --> 42:36.546
Mioshi. Mioshi.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.186
This is not Asani, Jonathan.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.752
This is Mioshi, my first daughter.

42:45.796 --> 42:51.826
She has used you to have me killed.
And to my shame, you will die as well.

42:52.803 --> 42:55.772
- You never left the grounds?
- <i>O</i> f course not.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.967
We had to wait for him to come to us.

42:58.008 --> 43:02.206
You speak as though
I were vermin to be exterminated.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.544
I can understand my enemies, but you...

43:04.582 --> 43:07.073
The pearls are not enough. I am your father.

43:07.117 --> 43:09.108
You are dead.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.348
All you have ever given me
is the touch of a dead man

43:13.390 --> 43:15.881
and the shriveled heart of a dead man.

43:16.794 --> 43:19.820
Nothing changes.

43:45.189 --> 43:46.850
Closer, T.C. Closer.

44:07.111 --> 44:09.443
There'll be no more killing here.

44:12.182 --> 44:13.706
Don't.

44:17.755 --> 44:23.489
If you had any honor left,
you would use this on yourself.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.312
I'm thinking of a verse.

44:53.357 --> 44:55.450
Since settling to earth.

44:55.492 --> 44:58.120
The high spirit of that kite.

44:58.162 --> 44:59.527
Is gone completely.

45:00.764 --> 45:02.789
A poignant haiku.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.267
But neither of us
has settled to earth just yet.

45:06.937 --> 45:08.268
Do you know this one?

45:09.206 --> 45:11.197
You summer grasses.

45:11.241 --> 45:14.142
Glorious dreams of great warriors.

45:14.178 --> 45:16.408
Now only in ruins.

45:19.350 --> 45:22.080
- Jonathan, there is so much...
- Not now.

45:23.287 --> 45:25.278
Let it become the past.

45:25.856 --> 45:28.586
There will be time enough
for us to talk about it then.

46:22.546 --> 46:26.004
I'm sorry. I thought
maybe now he would say something.

46:27.084 --> 46:31.020
Don't be sorry.
I am no longer murahachibu.

46:31.955 --> 46:33.286
He saw me.

46:54.044 --> 46:56.376
- Hi.
- Hi, guys. What's going on?

46:57.314 --> 47:00.306
- Not a lot.
- The kind of day to pay back your buddies.

47:00.350 --> 47:03.615
Mm-hm. Try and remember, Thomas.
Think of your karma.

47:03.654 --> 47:08.557
A week as a chauffeur.
In livery.

47:08.592 --> 47:11.527
And when you're done driving T.C. around,

47:11.562 --> 47:14.053
there's the book-keeping you owe me.

47:17.434 --> 47:18.594
What's this?

47:18.635 --> 47:21.297
A fortune cookie
I got with some Sichuan food.

47:21.338 --> 47:26.298
- That made you turn over a new leaf?
- A man of good fortune repays his reward.

47:26.977 --> 47:29.741
- Sounds good to me.
- That's my old fortune.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.839
<i>O</i> Id fortune?

47:31.882 --> 47:33.645
What's this?

47:33.684 --> 47:37.450
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta go.
I've got another friend in a lot of trouble.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.718
That's my new fortune.

47:43.694 --> 47:49.360
"Help me. I'm being held prisoner
in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."
