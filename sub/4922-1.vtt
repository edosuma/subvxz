02:38.300 --> 02:41.413
Truck looks great.
Must be a fortune here.

02:41.518 --> 02:44.336
I know, just not in front of him, OK?

02:44.440 --> 02:47.877
Fellas, what's going on?
I've been here too long.

02:47.982 --> 02:50.977
- Give us a minute.
- No. Check this out.

02:51.688 --> 02:56.140
You can't get no cleaner. These are
very popular with the children.

02:56.244 --> 02:59.514
This is a federal tax stamp.
You can't get no cleaner.

02:59.618 --> 03:02.476
You keep 'em
if it's such a great deal.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.481
I ain't from Detroit. I don't know
nobody who can handle a job this big.

03:06.586 --> 03:10.486
You're supposed to have the
connections. Do what you want to do.

03:10.591 --> 03:15.200
- It ain't easy to get rid of this.
- I know, but I'm a businessman.

03:15.305 --> 03:18.796
Warm up the truck.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

03:20.009 --> 03:22.041
- Here you go.
- You're a sharp kid.

03:22.145 --> 03:23.957
Thank you.

03:24.061 --> 03:28.589
Cousin, my man, don't dash yet.
This looks like $2,000, not $5,000.

03:28.693 --> 03:31.842
- Let me see.
- The deal is for 5,000.

03:31.946 --> 03:35.179
I told my people
there should be five grand.

03:35.283 --> 03:39.137
- They stiffed us.
- No, they stiffed you.

03:39.241 --> 03:43.644
You can't count on anybody.
But let's not hassle about it now.

03:43.749 --> 03:47.777
Take the two grand and on the next
score, I'll make it up to you.

03:47.881 --> 03:51.029
Don't jerk me off. This is bullshit.

03:51.133 --> 03:54.488
I need $5,000, not $2,000.
Don't do this to me.

03:54.592 --> 03:57.450
Come on, you ain't dealin'
with Johnny Bananas.

03:57.554 --> 04:00.207
I know I ain't.
Can I have my money?

04:00.311 --> 04:04.373
Can I say it slow for you?
I need $5,000. Read my lips.

04:04.478 --> 04:08.084
$5,000 is what I need.
I can't do nothing with that.

04:08.189 --> 04:11.591
You want to be an asshole,
smoke 'em yourself.

04:11.695 --> 04:14.440
I don't smoke Lucky Strike.
I smoke King Size Kent.

04:17.527 --> 04:20.197
Fuck this.
Nice doing business with you.

04:20.697 --> 04:22.518
What you doing here?

04:22.622 --> 04:26.229
Officer, you know what happened?
You ain't going to believe it.

04:26.333 --> 04:30.491
The truck just stopped. You got
some cables, you give me a jump?

04:32.334 --> 04:35.251
- Don't I know you?
- No, I'm from Buffalo.

04:39.216 --> 04:41.255
Break out some ID.

04:45.806 --> 04:48.095
Let's get the fuck outta here!

06:20.738 --> 06:21.780
Shit!

07:56.545 --> 07:58.372
Freeze, asshole!

08:07.306 --> 08:10.057
Foley, we should have known
it was you!

08:16.189 --> 08:18.221
Axel. Way to go!

08:18.325 --> 08:20.597
- I don't have time.
- Todd's after you.

08:20.701 --> 08:25.434
He said it's your worst fuck-up.
I don't think that's true.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.980
- He's not in there.
- I see that.

08:28.085 --> 08:32.611
If you'd busted them, maybe he
wouldn't be so mad, but you haggled.

08:32.715 --> 08:35.986
$2,000 wasn't enough.
They'd have known I was a cop.

08:36.091 --> 08:39.282
- Leave me alone.
- Don't go anywhere.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.039
- You asshole.
- I'm not saying you did wrong,

08:42.144 --> 08:45.708
but if you had busted them,
it would have been better.

08:45.812 --> 08:48.084
- Where you going?
- Out of here.

08:48.188 --> 08:50.667
- Big mistake. You want my advice?
- No.

08:50.771 --> 08:53.880
Go in there, talk to him.
He'll be right back.

08:53.985 --> 08:57.220
Jeff, get away from me.
I'm going to shoot you.

08:57.324 --> 09:01.350
- You know what I would do?
- Lighten up. I'm not listening. OK?

09:01.454 --> 09:04.059
You're making it a lot worse
for yourself.

09:04.163 --> 09:06.187
Look at this. Thank you, guys.

09:06.292 --> 09:08.525
Axel, you got a cigarette?

09:09.662 --> 09:13.946
- Did you write that one?
- Everybody knows about the truck.

09:14.050 --> 09:17.208
Will you listen to me?
I am not listening to you.

09:18.337 --> 09:20.574
Great. Real mature.

09:20.678 --> 09:24.535
I am not listening to Jeffrey,
but he's still talking.

09:24.639 --> 09:28.127
- I hate when you do that.
- Stop, then!

09:28.231 --> 09:31.841
- Is that fucking Foley in here?
- There's Todd, it's show time.

09:33.770 --> 09:35.469
Boss, I know...

09:35.573 --> 09:40.219
Where do you come off going
undercover without my authorisation?

09:40.323 --> 09:44.519
You want to play cowboy cop,
do it in someone else's precinct.

09:44.624 --> 09:48.908
- Want to hear my side of the story?
- What's your side of the story?

09:50.036 --> 09:52.068
Let's hear your side of the story.

09:52.172 --> 09:56.236
Do you know how much this stunt
of yours is going to cost this city?

09:56.341 --> 10:01.036
Cost isn't the issue. It's my blatant
disregard for proper procedure.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.452
You're damn right, wise-ass!

10:03.556 --> 10:06.958
The mayor called the chief,
he called the deputy,

10:07.063 --> 10:10.750
he chewed my ass out.
You see I don't have any of it left!

10:10.854 --> 10:13.797
Where the fuck d'you get
the cigarettes from, anyway?

10:13.901 --> 10:18.218
- From the Dearborn hijack.
- That bust went down last week.

10:18.322 --> 10:21.972
- That truck should be in the pound.
- I told you.

10:22.077 --> 10:25.227
- It's none of your business.
- This isn't my locker.

10:25.331 --> 10:28.769
Listen, Axel.
No more set-ups, you understand?

10:28.874 --> 10:31.399
You're a good cop
with great potential,

10:31.504 --> 10:33.944
but you don't know
every fucking thing.

10:34.048 --> 10:38.780
I'm tired of taking the heat for you.
Once more and you're on the street.

10:38.884 --> 10:40.910
- Do you understand?
- Look...

10:41.014 --> 10:43.295
Do you understand me?

10:44.426 --> 10:47.131
Yeah, I understand. Boss...

10:48.805 --> 10:52.085
Chief ain't chewed it all.
You still got some ass.

10:52.189 --> 10:56.680
Don't fuck with me, Axel.
Not now. Go on, go home.

12:24.362 --> 12:26.932
How you doing, man? How you doing?

12:27.036 --> 12:29.395
Still breaking in people's houses.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.567
What do you expect with that lock?
Buy a real lock.

12:32.672 --> 12:35.488
I got my pistol.
I'll shoot somebody.

12:35.592 --> 12:40.738
I can't afford no electric, close
my fridge. There's roaches in there.

12:40.842 --> 12:43.158
So what's up, man? Look at you!

12:43.262 --> 12:46.371
- When did you get out?
- Six months ago.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.293
And you're just coming to see me now?

12:49.398 --> 12:53.795
I got out early for good time and
I went to California, get some sun.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.924
I gotta show you something.

12:56.028 --> 12:59.471
I ain't seen you in two years, man.
What's up?

13:02.526 --> 13:04.347
10,000 Deutschmarks.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.561
- Deutschmark?
- Yeah.

13:06.665 --> 13:10.519
- What is that?
- They're bearer bonds. Untraceable.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.650
You stole 'em?

13:12.754 --> 13:16.276
- No.
- I don't want to hear it.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.826
- It's just good to see you.
- I missed you, man.

13:20.546 --> 13:23.370
- What were you doing in California?
- Working.

13:23.474 --> 13:25.496
- Working where?
- Guess.

13:25.601 --> 13:27.834
- I don't know.
- Beverly Hills.

13:29.388 --> 13:32.879
- What were you doing?
- You won't believe this.

13:32.983 --> 13:35.596
I was a security guard.

13:37.146 --> 13:39.720
Who'd hire you as a security guard?

13:40.733 --> 13:42.940
- Jenny Summers.
- Jenny Summers?

13:44.320 --> 13:46.351
I haven't seen Jenny in years.

13:46.456 --> 13:48.645
- What's she up to?
- She's doing great.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.895
She's manager of this art gallery.

13:50.999 --> 13:53.902
The Hollis Benton Art Gallery,
Beverly Hills.

13:54.006 --> 13:56.399
It's world famous. Ever hear of it?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.613
Yeah, I buy all my art there.

13:59.717 --> 14:01.742
Corner pocket, two cushions.

14:01.846 --> 14:04.784
- 50 bucks you don't make that shot.
- Bullshit.

14:04.889 --> 14:07.374
- 100.
- You got a bet.

14:15.811 --> 14:19.052
- What are you gonna do?
- You're as bright as always.

14:19.156 --> 14:23.010
20, 40, 60, 80, take it.
Have a party.

14:23.114 --> 14:25.973
Pleasure doing business with you.

14:26.078 --> 14:28.435
What the fuck you gonna do?

14:28.539 --> 14:30.940
Miss, two more Scotch and sodas.

14:35.539 --> 14:38.991
I got a great idea.
I got a great idea.

14:40.128 --> 14:42.536
Let's steal a car.

14:45.008 --> 14:47.039
Are you serious?

14:47.143 --> 14:50.581
I'm a fucking police officer.
I can't steal cars no more.

14:50.686 --> 14:53.710
How many times
have you stolen a car, man?

14:53.815 --> 14:55.848
A fucking Cadillac!

14:59.022 --> 15:03.731
Driving on the expressway
like two fucking maniacs.

15:06.571 --> 15:09.434
I remember you went to jail for that.

15:09.539 --> 15:14.234
- No, it was state school.
- That's jail when you're 15.

15:14.338 --> 15:18.197
That ain't jail, man. That's like
day camp compared to jail.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.045
How come you didn't tell on me
when you got caught?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.336
You don't know?

15:28.219 --> 15:30.544
- You don't know?
- No.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.715
Because I love you, man.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.480
One more round.

15:46.947 --> 15:50.731
Hold still. Mike, I gotta open
the door, OK? Balance yourself.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.151
Here we go, Mike.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.528
I'm opening the door now, OK?
Here we go.

15:58.633 --> 15:59.675
Axel!

16:05.674 --> 16:07.744
Hey, Mikey, where have you been?

16:07.848 --> 16:09.874
What's up, Zack?

16:09.978 --> 16:12.001
What have you got there, Mikey?

16:12.105 --> 16:14.138
What is this? Your laundry?

16:16.978 --> 16:19.425
I swear,
I was going to bring 'em back.

16:19.529 --> 16:21.969
- You got lost?
- No.

16:22.074 --> 16:26.313
I came to see my friend. I had 'em
with me. I figured, you know...

16:27.614 --> 16:31.648
- What you doing?
- What am I supposed to do, Mikey?

16:31.752 --> 16:36.482
There was a whole box of them. I
didn't think anybody'd miss a couple.

16:36.586 --> 16:38.567
I figured I'd take 'em...

16:38.672 --> 16:41.613
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:41.717 --> 16:43.751
No, shut up.

16:45.382 --> 16:48.467
- Man, please.
- Just shut up, Mikey.

16:51.972 --> 16:54.012
I swear...

16:56.352 --> 17:00.885
I swear, if you ever show
your face out there again...

17:00.990 --> 17:05.554
- Ever.
- I won't. I promise you. I'm sorry.

17:05.657 --> 17:09.643
I fucked up, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:09.747 --> 17:12.195
- Ever.
- I'm sorry.

17:38.061 --> 17:42.800
Axel, go to the hospital and get
that bump on your head checked out.

17:42.904 --> 17:46.399
- My head is all right, man.
- It's not a request, Axel.

17:58.749 --> 18:02.284
Boss. Boss...
Can I talk to you for a minute?

18:03.838 --> 18:06.285
I heard you got Rand on this case.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.662
He doesn't know the time of day.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.580
Don't mess with me.

18:10.684 --> 18:13.292
He hasn't left his desk in 12 years.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.214
At least he's had 12 years.

18:16.318 --> 18:21.720
Anyway, it's a homicide case and it
belongs to Rand. Go to the hospital.

18:21.824 --> 18:25.094
- Can I ask around a bit?
- Don't do a thing.

18:25.199 --> 18:28.268
You're skating on thin ice as it is.

18:28.373 --> 18:31.022
We're talking about a friend of mine!

18:31.126 --> 18:33.186
Yes, we are, aren't we?

18:33.290 --> 18:35.400
Let's take a close look at that.

18:35.504 --> 18:39.319
One, a hoodlum friend.
Two, a professional hit.

18:39.423 --> 18:41.696
Three, in a cop's apartment.

18:41.801 --> 18:44.491
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

18:44.595 --> 18:49.327
- Why a professional hit?
- I didn't just walk into this town.

18:49.431 --> 18:52.706
Whoever killed your friend
wasn't worried about you.

18:52.811 --> 18:56.629
If they were, you'd be lying
beside him in that meat wagon.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.967
Don't do a damn thing.
Stay out of this.

19:00.071 --> 19:04.053
I'm owed some vacation time.
I want to take my vacation now.

19:04.157 --> 19:06.309
Stay away from this case.

19:06.903 --> 19:09.987
I just need a little vacation,
that's all.

19:13.743 --> 19:17.438
All right, as soon as you finish
at the hospital, you're on vacation.

19:17.543 --> 19:19.359
Thank you.

19:19.463 --> 19:22.572
But if you decide
to butt into this case,

19:22.676 --> 19:26.370
it'll be the longest vacation
you ever heard of.

20:56.475 --> 21:00.509
- Checking in today, sir?
- That depends. This hotel expensive?

21:00.613 --> 21:04.187
Not for Beverly Hills.
Can I get your bags for you?

21:06.276 --> 21:09.147
Yeah, that's my bag
in the front seat.

21:19.665 --> 21:23.111
I'm sorry, sir, we just
have nothing available tonight.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.740
I suggest next time
you call for a reservation

21:25.845 --> 21:27.870
at least a week in advance.

21:27.974 --> 21:30.051
Thank you.

21:30.176 --> 21:32.413
- Hi.
- The nerve of some people!

21:32.517 --> 21:33.915
May I help you?

21:34.020 --> 21:36.211
You have a reservation
for Axel Foley.

21:36.316 --> 21:38.383
Let's see.

21:39.602 --> 21:42.843
I'm sorry, I don't see
anything under that name.

21:42.947 --> 21:47.565
Check Rolling Stone Magazine's
Axel Foley, that's what it is.

21:51.239 --> 21:54.396
No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley.
I'm sorry, sir.

21:54.500 --> 21:59.482
You probably just made a mistake.
Just give me another room.

21:59.587 --> 22:02.155
Sorry, sir,
but there are none available.

22:04.712 --> 22:08.619
Don't you think I realise what's
going on? Who do you think I am?

22:08.723 --> 22:11.496
If I was some hotshot
from out of town

22:11.600 --> 22:16.416
and you'd made a reservation mistake,
I'd be the first to get a room.

22:16.520 --> 22:20.294
I'm not some hotshot, I'm
a small reporter from Rolling Stone,

22:20.398 --> 22:22.796
here to do an interview
with Michael Jackson,

22:22.901 --> 22:25.721
that's gonna be
in every major magazine.

22:25.825 --> 22:29.391
I wanted to call it Jackson
Is Sitting On Top Of The World.

22:29.495 --> 22:32.562
Now I'll call it
Jackson Can Sit On Top Of The World

22:32.667 --> 22:36.270
But Not In The Beverly Palm Hotel
Cos There's No Niggers Allowed.

22:36.375 --> 22:41.070
Excuse me, sir, it seems
we have a last-minute cancellation.

22:41.174 --> 22:43.568
There is a room available, a suite,

22:43.672 --> 22:46.782
but I'll charge you
the single-room rate.

22:46.886 --> 22:49.621
Thank you. I'm sorry,
it's probably jet lag.

22:49.725 --> 22:51.831
- I understand.
- What's the rate?

22:51.935 --> 22:54.049
That'll be $235 a night, sir.

22:58.850 --> 22:59.893
Fine.

23:00.977 --> 23:04.008
- That'll be suite 1035.
- Thank you very much.

23:04.113 --> 23:06.146
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

23:07.068 --> 23:09.727
If Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

23:09.831 --> 23:10.874
Of course.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.584
- How you are doing?
- Hi.

24:15.688 --> 24:19.542
I'm fine. My name is Serge.
How can I help you?

24:19.646 --> 24:21.884
I'm looking for Miss Jenny Summers.

24:23.354 --> 24:26.884
It's very busy today.
You give me your name?

24:26.988 --> 24:30.512
- My name's Axel Foley.
- What it's pertaining?

24:30.617 --> 24:35.145
- I didn't understand.
- Pertaining, meaning, regarding...

24:35.250 --> 24:37.940
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.288
Donny.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.287
One moment.

24:43.834 --> 24:47.409
Donny, tell Miss Summers
that Ahmed Farley's here to...

24:47.513 --> 24:50.624
- No, Axel Foley.
- Ahmel... Ahwell...

24:52.217 --> 24:55.458
Foley's here,
he's an old acquaintance.

24:55.563 --> 24:57.375
Cover this up.

24:57.479 --> 25:00.713
It's like the breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

25:00.818 --> 25:03.468
- It's not sexy, it's animal.
- Not sexy at all.

25:03.573 --> 25:09.020
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, cocktail, espresso?

25:09.778 --> 25:10.971
No, thank you.

25:11.075 --> 25:14.517
I make it myself, with a lemon twist.
You should try it.

25:14.621 --> 25:17.063
No, I'm fine.

25:17.167 --> 25:21.106
- I see you look at this piece.
- How much would it go for?

25:21.210 --> 25:22.988
$130,000.

25:23.092 --> 25:25.403
- Get the fuck outta here.
- No, I cannot.

25:25.507 --> 25:27.738
It's a very important piece.

25:27.843 --> 25:30.784
- Ever sold one of these?
- Yesterday.

25:30.888 --> 25:35.122
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm serious. I sell it myself.

25:35.226 --> 25:36.957
What are you doing here?

25:37.061 --> 25:40.796
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. Hold on a second.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.384
Great. Excuse me, Serge.

25:45.189 --> 25:48.052
- What are you doing here?
- How you doing?

25:48.157 --> 25:50.720
It's good to see you.
How've you been?

25:50.824 --> 25:52.851
- Look at you!
- You like?

25:52.955 --> 25:55.183
Yeah. You're getting old.

25:55.288 --> 25:56.936
Fuck you.

25:57.041 --> 25:59.066
- What is this?
- A moustache.

25:59.170 --> 26:02.857
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.988
You have someplace we can talk?

26:05.092 --> 26:08.908
Yeah. Over there. Come on.

26:09.012 --> 26:11.536
- You've filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

26:11.641 --> 26:13.664
No, it looks good, though.

26:13.769 --> 26:15.637
Sit down.

26:17.514 --> 26:21.097
- I want to talk about Mikey.
- Is he in trouble again?

26:24.354 --> 26:26.440
He's dead.

26:28.525 --> 26:29.568
What?

26:30.360 --> 26:33.445
He came into Detroit
and somebody killed him.

26:36.074 --> 26:38.114
I don't believe this.

26:47.879 --> 26:51.462
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

26:54.761 --> 26:58.417
Mikey mentioned
that you helped him get a job.

26:58.522 --> 26:59.974
Yeah...

27:01.726 --> 27:04.929
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favour to me.

27:05.605 --> 27:09.188
- Who's this guy?
- His name is Victor Maitland.

27:10.318 --> 27:14.482
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

27:14.907 --> 27:17.030
I can't talk now,
I have to go upstairs.

27:17.326 --> 27:19.357
That's cool.

27:19.461 --> 27:23.360
I'll call you later on
and we'll get together and talk, OK?

27:23.464 --> 27:24.507
Sure.

27:26.377 --> 27:28.045
Be good.

27:36.428 --> 27:39.292
Hi. Delivery for Victor Maitland.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.753
I'll take it upstairs to him.

27:41.858 --> 27:44.004
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

27:44.108 --> 27:46.173
Deliveries should be left here.

27:46.278 --> 27:49.097
He has to get these flowers.
I'll go up myself.

27:49.202 --> 27:51.223
You're not supposed to.

27:51.328 --> 27:54.311
Floral delivery is my life.
I have to take it.

27:54.415 --> 27:57.685
- Who let you in?
- I let myself in.

27:57.789 --> 28:01.235
How you doing? I have some questions
about Michael Tandino.

28:03.582 --> 28:06.037
Speak to you later, darling.

28:09.087 --> 28:12.162
What, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr Tandino?

28:12.266 --> 28:16.037
He was my best friend. He visited me
in Detroit a couple of days ago.

28:16.141 --> 28:19.212
Soon after he got there,
someone killed him.

28:19.316 --> 28:22.004
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

28:22.108 --> 28:23.975
It's fucked up.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.939
And? What do you wish to know?

28:30.359 --> 28:34.138
- He worked for you, didn't he?
- Yes, yes, he did.

28:34.242 --> 28:36.558
Good gracious!

28:36.662 --> 28:40.148
I'm really sorry to hear this.
Would you like to sit down?

28:40.253 --> 28:42.942
Can I get you anything?

28:43.046 --> 28:47.491
- No, I'm all right.
- How on earth did this happen?

28:47.595 --> 28:50.338
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

28:53.634 --> 28:54.661
Yeah.

28:54.765 --> 28:59.427
I do hope the police have procured
some intelligent leads.

29:01.767 --> 29:04.222
Exactly what did Mikey do for you?

29:06.271 --> 29:08.727
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

29:09.524 --> 29:11.178
My name is Foley.

29:11.282 --> 29:14.806
Excuse me, Mr Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

29:14.910 --> 29:19.396
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

29:19.500 --> 29:23.484
So, if you'll forgive me,
I must get back to work.

29:23.588 --> 29:27.821
- All I want to know is...
- Please show Mr Foley to the door.

29:27.925 --> 29:30.366
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

29:30.470 --> 29:34.959
Get off me, man.
Get the fuck off me. Get off!

29:36.219 --> 29:38.840
Get the fuck off me, man. Get off!

29:41.182 --> 29:46.259
Get off me. Think I'm playing games?
I'm fucking somebody up.

29:55.990 --> 29:58.029
What the fuck is this shit?

30:02.162 --> 30:04.648
Did you see that?
I can describe them all.

30:04.753 --> 30:07.279
Put your hands
on the hood of the car.

30:07.383 --> 30:10.959
- What's with you guys?
- You heard him, sir. Do it now.

30:12.089 --> 30:14.997
What kind of shit is this?
Wait a second.

30:15.101 --> 30:18.500
You're arresting me
for getting thrown out of a window?

30:18.604 --> 30:21.082
I got thrown out of a window, man!

30:21.187 --> 30:23.222
Gun, partner!

30:23.810 --> 30:27.173
Sir, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

30:27.277 --> 30:29.886
Anything you say will be used
against you in court.

30:29.990 --> 30:32.347
You have the right
to have an attorney.

30:32.451 --> 30:34.475
I understand the rights.

30:34.579 --> 30:37.479
This is bullshit.
I got thrown out of a window.

30:37.583 --> 30:40.233
- Get in the car.
- What's the charge?

30:40.337 --> 30:43.773
Possession of a concealed weapon
and disturbing the peace.

30:43.877 --> 30:46.025
I got thrown out of a window!

30:46.129 --> 30:49.532
What's the charge for getting
pushed out of a car, jaywalking?

30:49.636 --> 30:51.454
This is bullshit!

30:58.387 --> 31:02.672
You know, this is the cleanest and
nicest police car I've ever been in.

31:02.776 --> 31:04.806
It's nicer than my apartment.

31:08.940 --> 31:14.639
Officers, if we see any movie stars
could you point them out to me?

31:14.743 --> 31:16.768
That's enough talking.

31:16.872 --> 31:19.023
OK, that's cool.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.956
This is nice.

31:33.340 --> 31:36.831
It's about time. I thought
you'd forgot me. I was hungry.

31:36.935 --> 31:41.719
I've never seen a cell with a phone.
Could I stay cos I ordered pizza?

31:45.686 --> 31:47.725
Somebody'll eat it.

32:08.001 --> 32:11.037
Have a seat right over there, please.

32:17.135 --> 32:21.503
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this
is my partner, Detective Rosewood.

32:21.607 --> 32:25.726
Do you always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

32:26.895 --> 32:30.803
Why didn't you say you were a police
officer when you were arrested?

32:30.907 --> 32:33.808
Where do you get off
arresting somebody

32:33.912 --> 32:36.101
for getting thrown out of a window?

32:36.205 --> 32:39.060
Six witnesses say you started
tearing up the place,

32:39.164 --> 32:41.197
then jumped out the window.

32:41.952 --> 32:45.193
You believe that? What the fuck
are you, cops or doormen?

32:45.297 --> 32:48.946
We're more likely to believe
an important local businessman

32:49.050 --> 32:51.074
than a foul-mouthed jerk.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.495
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

32:56.383 --> 33:00.247
- Watch your mouth.
- Don't square off on me.

33:00.351 --> 33:03.016
- Don't push me.
- Fuck you, man.

33:03.975 --> 33:05.644
Taggart!

33:07.354 --> 33:09.975
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

33:26.623 --> 33:27.874
Sir...

33:29.042 --> 33:31.795
I apologise for striking you.

33:32.922 --> 33:35.247
I have no excuse.

33:37.718 --> 33:39.621
Forget about it.

33:39.726 --> 33:44.210
I am Lieutenant Bogomil of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

33:44.314 --> 33:48.254
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

33:48.358 --> 33:50.175
Is this a joke?

33:50.279 --> 33:54.724
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

33:54.828 --> 33:59.474
Where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.438
No, I don't want to do that.

34:02.542 --> 34:06.065
In Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.027
Why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

34:09.132 --> 34:11.279
I'm on vacation.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.453
Then why were you
in Victor Maitland's office?

34:14.556 --> 34:18.130
I had to go to the bathroom.
It looked like a nice clean place.

34:21.138 --> 34:25.670
- Always take your gun on vacation?
- Don't know. Never been on vacation.

34:25.775 --> 34:28.714
But, in Detroit,
cops must always carry a firearm.

34:28.818 --> 34:31.759
If you want to carry a gun,
go back there.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.222
I really can't wait to get back.

34:34.326 --> 34:38.520
Is that so? I just spoke
to Inspector Todd in Detroit.

34:38.623 --> 34:40.856
Does that name ring a bell?

34:43.077 --> 34:46.696
- He's my boss.
- You may not be welcome back.

34:48.666 --> 34:51.574
He says you're
an outstanding young detective.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.237
I find that difficult to believe.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.159
It's true.

34:56.263 --> 35:00.469
He also says he nearly fired you.
I find that very easy to believe.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.212
What are you doing here?

35:04.316 --> 35:06.710
I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom

35:06.815 --> 35:09.091
and six guys threw me out a window.

35:09.195 --> 35:13.344
Inspector Todd gave me a message
for you. Wanna hear it?

35:13.448 --> 35:14.491
No.

35:14.610 --> 35:17.889
He says if you're here
investigating the Tandino murder,

35:17.993 --> 35:20.141
don't bother coming back.

35:20.246 --> 35:23.565
If we inform him
you are working on this case,

35:23.669 --> 35:25.700
he'll have you fired.

35:26.830 --> 35:29.067
One last time, what are you doing?

35:29.171 --> 35:31.197
I'm on vacation!

35:31.302 --> 35:32.871
Vacation.

35:33.420 --> 35:37.034
Rosewood, take Mr Foley
over to the courthouse

35:37.139 --> 35:39.581
and let him arrange for bail.

35:39.685 --> 35:41.747
Follow me, sir.

35:41.852 --> 35:46.140
I got to hand it to you guys,
you are extremely polite.

35:47.394 --> 35:50.311
Pretty good punch you got, Taggart.

35:54.359 --> 35:56.398
After you.

35:57.362 --> 35:59.447
After you.

35:59.739 --> 36:02.028
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

36:03.702 --> 36:05.566
Thanks for bailing me out, Jen.

36:05.670 --> 36:09.487
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

36:09.591 --> 36:13.785
- You don't mean that.
- No, I don't mean that.

36:13.889 --> 36:16.954
If it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be a waitress.

36:17.059 --> 36:21.705
The day Mikey got killed, he showed
up with a bag of German bearer bonds.

36:21.809 --> 36:24.667
I think he stole them
from whoever killed him.

36:24.772 --> 36:28.212
When I mentioned Mikey's name,
Maitland threw me out.

36:28.316 --> 36:33.594
You look like a hoodlum. You barge
into his office, carrying a gun.

36:33.698 --> 36:36.888
If I didn't know you,
I'd throw you out.

36:36.992 --> 36:38.807
Is this your car?

36:38.912 --> 36:41.852
No. In Beverly Hills
we just take the closest one.

36:41.956 --> 36:47.566
I remember you used to drive
that crappy blue Chevy Nova.

36:47.671 --> 36:49.901
What are you driving now?

36:50.005 --> 36:53.075
The same crappy blue Chevy Nova.

36:53.179 --> 36:56.449
Do you think it's too late
for me to study art?

36:56.553 --> 36:59.705
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

36:59.810 --> 37:03.664
You don't think he has anything
to do with Mikey's death?

37:03.768 --> 37:08.087
No, I was just poking around.
I don't think he did nothing.

37:08.191 --> 37:13.311
Victor is one of the top art dealers
in the US, he has been for ten years.

37:13.816 --> 37:15.856
I'm impressed.

37:20.073 --> 37:23.980
- What are you looking at?
- The cops, they're following us.

37:24.084 --> 37:26.579
What? Where?

37:27.580 --> 37:30.664
In the back, on the right.
Beige Ford.

37:59.488 --> 38:01.725
Can you believe this place?

38:01.829 --> 38:04.188
How can you afford this?

38:04.292 --> 38:06.732
They only charged me
the single-room rate.

38:06.836 --> 38:09.315
- How can you afford that?
- I can't.

38:09.419 --> 38:12.075
In the bathroom they got little robes

38:12.179 --> 38:14.488
with the hotel's initials on it.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.908
I love this place, I can't leave.

38:17.012 --> 38:19.327
- I'm going to steal one. Want one?
- No.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.759
You want some slippers?
I'm going to steal them, too.

38:23.346 --> 38:25.386
Excuse me, two seconds.

38:28.268 --> 38:32.968
Hello, room service?
This is Mr Axel Foley in suite 1035.

38:33.073 --> 38:36.427
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.601
I want you to deliver it
to this beige Ford on Wilshire.

38:39.705 --> 38:44.074
Send down one bay shrimp
salad sandwich. OK?

38:45.161 --> 38:48.774
Right. And is the cold poached salmon
in dill sauce tasty?

38:48.878 --> 38:53.528
OK, send one of those down.
And send down something for dessert.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.826
All right. Thank you.

38:55.930 --> 38:57.953
You're quite a sport.

38:58.057 --> 39:00.828
How long are you going to stay?

39:00.933 --> 39:03.382
Until I find out who killed Mikey.

39:06.057 --> 39:10.879
And I'm considering checking out
the warehouse where he worked.

39:10.983 --> 39:14.228
Really?
How you planning on getting in?

39:34.920 --> 39:37.073
- Good evening, sir.
- What is that?

39:37.177 --> 39:39.870
Late supper,
compliments of Mr Axel Foley.

39:39.974 --> 39:44.916
- Foley? How'd he know we were here?
- Because I let you drive.

39:45.021 --> 39:47.378
I need a couple of bananas. How much?

39:47.482 --> 39:52.714
The buffet plate is $12.50. You get
peaches, plums, oranges and bananas.

39:52.818 --> 39:55.768
All I need is a couple of bananas.

40:00.905 --> 40:03.186
Go ahead, take those bananas.

40:03.290 --> 40:05.359
Thank you.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.774
- I'm not eating that. Take it back.
- Certainly.

40:08.879 --> 40:10.911
This really looks great.

40:24.471 --> 40:28.220
- Could I get some extra mayo?
- Certainly, sir.

40:29.268 --> 40:31.426
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

40:32.479 --> 40:35.813
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

40:50.665 --> 40:53.121
What the hell are you doing?

41:03.678 --> 41:05.709
This the place?

41:05.814 --> 41:08.713
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I should do this.

41:08.818 --> 41:12.926
OK, but when you hear glass breaking,
don't get scared.

41:13.030 --> 41:16.188
It's just me kicking in the window.
Sit tight.

41:17.317 --> 41:19.856
All right. Come on, Axel.

41:42.468 --> 41:45.802
- What's happening, baby?
- Grow up.

42:00.070 --> 42:03.311
- Did you find something?
- Coffee grounds.

42:03.415 --> 42:04.458
So?

42:05.534 --> 42:07.898
You know what this is used for?

42:08.002 --> 42:10.358
People add hot water and drink it.

42:10.463 --> 42:14.785
I'll take this home, add hot water
and drink it in the morning.

42:29.225 --> 42:31.256
What are we hiding for?

42:31.361 --> 42:34.104
I wish you'd been with me last night.

42:35.023 --> 42:39.179
- What happened?
- We stopped in a joint for a drink.

42:39.283 --> 42:41.316
- Which one?
- A local joint.

42:42.322 --> 42:45.435
Some guy comes in,
sits a couple of stools away.

42:45.539 --> 42:49.689
He's got one of them eyes
that's going like this.

42:49.794 --> 42:53.028
I didn't know whether he was trying
to put the make on me.

42:53.132 --> 42:55.405
I thought I'd take you there tonight,

42:55.510 --> 42:59.168
let him have a shot at you
before I tore his head off.

43:09.475 --> 43:12.005
Let's go. I want to get out of here.

43:12.110 --> 43:15.222
- Just get off my back.
- Come on.

43:18.943 --> 43:20.819
I got it.

43:37.379 --> 43:41.163
- What the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later.

43:41.549 --> 43:43.370
Hurry up.

43:43.474 --> 43:45.954
- Give me the key.
- Ever driven a Mercedes?

43:46.058 --> 43:48.795
A car's a car.
I drive mine every day.

43:48.900 --> 43:52.758
- I'm driving, I've seen your car.
- Shit, that's cold.

44:00.528 --> 44:04.812
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

44:04.917 --> 44:07.060
- He distracted us.
- How?

44:07.165 --> 44:10.816
He sent us a late supper.
This waiter comes over...

44:10.920 --> 44:13.028
Billy, he gets the point.

44:13.132 --> 44:17.453
A late supper?
And what did you have, Rosewood?

44:18.796 --> 44:23.497
I think it was
a shrimp salad sandwich, sir.

44:23.601 --> 44:27.258
- A shrimp salad sandwich?
- Yes, sir.

44:29.975 --> 44:34.131
I want you two to go back
to the hotel and wait for Foley.

44:34.235 --> 44:37.842
If you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. Got that?

44:37.946 --> 44:40.515
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

44:41.778 --> 44:43.818
A late supper.

44:45.782 --> 44:48.108
We've got something for you, Billy.

44:49.161 --> 44:51.912
An anti-banana disguise.

44:55.083 --> 44:59.378
- It may come in handy.
- A little extra protection, Billy.

45:00.506 --> 45:02.546
Very funny.

45:04.636 --> 45:05.678
Let's go.

45:20.985 --> 45:24.817
- You take the car and go home.
- What about you?

45:25.740 --> 45:27.771
I want to find out about this place.

45:27.875 --> 45:30.020
It's a bonded warehouse.

45:30.125 --> 45:33.861
They hold our foreign shipments
till they clear customs.

45:33.965 --> 45:36.488
I'm going to check it out. Go home.

45:36.592 --> 45:40.531
Damn it, Axel.
I'm not going to bail you out again.

45:40.635 --> 45:42.299
Go home.

46:38.566 --> 46:41.650
How you doing?
Come here for a second, please.

46:43.613 --> 46:46.227
- Hi, you have a match?
- No smoking in here.

46:46.331 --> 46:50.186
I'm going to smoke when
I go outside. Thank you very much.

46:50.290 --> 46:52.522
- Is your supervisor here?
- In the office.

46:52.627 --> 46:54.736
- Will you get him?
- What's the problem?

46:54.840 --> 46:55.986
You security?

46:56.091 --> 46:59.535
Then you're the fucking problem.
Get your supervisor. Now.

47:00.338 --> 47:01.380
Now!

47:01.797 --> 47:02.840
OK.

47:09.806 --> 47:12.297
He didn't come back yet.

47:14.936 --> 47:17.551
What do we do now?

47:17.655 --> 47:19.316
We wait.

47:22.361 --> 47:23.403
OK.

47:23.570 --> 47:26.645
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor?

47:26.749 --> 47:29.897
- Yes. Who are you?
- Inspector Rafferty, US Customs.

47:30.002 --> 47:33.568
- Has all this gone through customs?
- No, this is the bonded area.

47:33.672 --> 47:37.360
Then tell me,
how can a black man, dressed like me,

47:37.464 --> 47:40.285
just march in and start poking around

47:40.389 --> 47:43.049
without being asked any questions?

47:44.258 --> 47:46.917
- I don't know.
- That's the answer I wanted.

47:47.022 --> 47:50.419
Give me your ID numbers.
Somebody's going to lose their job.

47:50.523 --> 47:54.505
- He gave me a match.
- You gave him a match?

47:54.609 --> 47:57.881
Listen. I do security checks
all over the nation.

47:57.986 --> 48:00.012
And apart from Cleveland,

48:00.116 --> 48:03.348
this place has the worst security
in the nation.

48:03.453 --> 48:06.352
Call your wives
cos we'll be here all night.

48:06.457 --> 48:09.689
We're gonna check the background
of every crate,

48:09.793 --> 48:11.778
starting with this one.

48:14.248 --> 48:19.032
It says here that by the time
the average American is 50,

48:19.136 --> 48:23.588
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

48:24.967 --> 48:26.998
Why are you telling me this?

48:27.102 --> 48:30.961
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

48:32.099 --> 48:34.555
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

48:35.311 --> 48:38.257
The inspector needs
the information on those bills.

48:38.362 --> 48:40.221
All the manifests, too.

48:40.325 --> 48:43.930
And records of all shipments
due into the same destination.

48:44.034 --> 48:46.265
- What's this about?
- Just do it.

48:46.369 --> 48:49.144
You got a warrant for this?

48:49.248 --> 48:53.776
You have a very big mouth, sir.
Are you hiding something from me?

48:53.880 --> 48:57.196
I bet that's your Porsche outside.
Is it?

48:57.300 --> 49:01.743
Would you like me to have the IRS
crawl up your ass with a microscope?

49:01.847 --> 49:04.995
It's not pretty.
I want you to know something.

49:05.100 --> 49:09.747
I want you all to know, I could
have 25 agents here in 15 minutes,

49:09.851 --> 49:14.170
to march in here, snatch your bond
and you'd be out of business,

49:14.274 --> 49:16.383
if you don't cooperate. Understood?

49:16.487 --> 49:19.148
We'll give you everything you need.

49:20.107 --> 49:23.015
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche, sir.

49:23.120 --> 49:27.322
You've nothing to worry about, then.
You all take me for a fool. Hurry!

49:34.246 --> 49:38.161
I notice you've been drinking
a lot of coffee lately.

49:39.961 --> 49:43.461
I think that's why
you have a hard time relaxing.

50:02.442 --> 50:07.310
Jesus Christ!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

50:07.414 --> 50:11.562
- What are you doing here so late?
- You're a cocky son of a bitch.

50:11.666 --> 50:14.524
If you're still mad
about the banana, I'm sorry.

50:14.628 --> 50:16.692
I needed some time to myself.

50:16.796 --> 50:20.737
I wish I'd seen your face
when the car conked out.

50:20.841 --> 50:23.912
Very funny. The lieutenant
docked us two days' pay.

50:24.016 --> 50:26.046
Get outta here!

50:28.636 --> 50:32.136
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

50:33.266 --> 50:35.555
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

50:36.352 --> 50:38.550
It was a joke, like the bananas.

50:38.655 --> 50:44.724
I know what it's like on a stakeout.
That food was from the heart.

50:44.828 --> 50:46.697
Bullshit!

50:47.323 --> 50:51.367
Why are we always arguing? We're all
cops. We should work together.

50:51.869 --> 50:53.689
We've all had a rough day.

50:53.794 --> 50:58.615
What do you say we go get something
to drink, make up and be friends?

50:59.418 --> 51:01.503
Forget it.

51:01.837 --> 51:06.909
OK, fuck it. I'm going to get
a drink. Follow me if you want.

51:07.013 --> 51:09.917
But I lost you once, I can again.

51:10.021 --> 51:13.707
Why don't we get something
to drink together? Let's be friends.

51:13.812 --> 51:17.299
- We don't drink on duty.
- OK. Fine.

51:17.404 --> 51:21.802
But listen. I found
the perfect place. I saw it today.

51:21.906 --> 51:26.268
It's perfect for you. It's
very conservative. You'll love it.

51:26.372 --> 51:28.818
It's nice. Trust me.

51:53.265 --> 51:55.502
- Hi. Can I get you something?
- Yes!

51:55.606 --> 51:59.841
Can I have a Scotch and soda?
What do you want?

51:59.945 --> 52:02.940
- Light beers for them.
- Two club sodas.

52:04.193 --> 52:07.517
You crack me up
with this "on duty" shit.

52:07.622 --> 52:11.658
Billy, you don't have to be
embarrassed if your dick is hard.

52:12.451 --> 52:15.981
Your dick is supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object.

52:16.085 --> 52:19.238
Taggart's dick is hard,
but he won't say. He's the boss.

52:19.343 --> 52:21.282
Boss's dick got to stay limp.

52:21.386 --> 52:24.379
I ain't on duty
so my dick can be hard.

52:26.300 --> 52:30.131
Taggart, look. I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

52:30.887 --> 52:33.712
- Billy! Give her this.
- No.

52:33.816 --> 52:36.380
Stuff that in her thing.
She'll go nuts.

52:36.852 --> 52:38.891
Excuse me.

52:40.647 --> 52:41.898
Billy.

52:44.318 --> 52:47.725
- What do you think?
- Coffee grounds. So?

52:47.829 --> 52:52.312
You guys don't know nothing
about nothing, do you?

52:52.416 --> 52:56.538
Make sure we get the right drinks.
I drink club soda, I'll throw up.

52:56.831 --> 53:00.081
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

53:23.442 --> 53:25.473
- She likes you.
- Think so?

53:25.577 --> 53:27.443
No doubt.

53:29.031 --> 53:32.447
Taggart... See that guy
over there in the black coat?

53:34.119 --> 53:37.194
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.

53:37.299 --> 53:40.575
It's June.
Isn't it hot for a long leather coat?

53:41.460 --> 53:43.491
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.043
Look at his partner.
They just came in.

53:49.051 --> 53:51.748
Something's getting ready to go down.

53:51.853 --> 53:55.043
- Go and cover that guy.
- What's going on?

53:55.148 --> 54:00.213
I'll check out this asshole at the
bar. Billy will make sure I behave.

54:00.317 --> 54:03.398
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

54:07.362 --> 54:09.401
No bullshit this time.

54:13.034 --> 54:15.276
Just sit tight, Billy.

54:42.315 --> 54:43.774
Philip!

54:44.275 --> 54:46.972
Man, what's happening, Phil?

54:47.077 --> 54:52.027
He said you don't come here no more,
but I said, "It's Phil".

54:52.616 --> 54:55.231
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!

54:55.335 --> 54:58.283
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!

55:00.959 --> 55:03.331
Everybody freeze!

55:03.837 --> 55:05.868
Turn around. Turn around!

55:05.973 --> 55:09.039
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!

55:09.143 --> 55:11.875
What's wrong?
What's all the hostility?

55:11.980 --> 55:14.917
- Get back.
- What's all this gun, man?

55:15.021 --> 55:17.046
You changed.

55:17.150 --> 55:19.218
Get back or I'll
blow your brains out.

55:22.814 --> 55:24.973
Police. Move and I'll kill you.

55:25.984 --> 55:28.607
Don't move! Turn over!

55:29.864 --> 55:33.021
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some cop. You know that?

55:33.126 --> 55:37.578
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

55:47.799 --> 55:49.209
Taggart.

55:50.385 --> 55:54.041
Would you explain why
you and Rosewood were in a strip bar

55:54.146 --> 55:56.963
out of our jurisdiction
while you were on duty?

55:57.067 --> 56:01.299
Before you chastise these officers,
there's something you should know.

56:01.403 --> 56:06.846
The only reason they were at a strip
bar is because they were tailing me.

56:06.950 --> 56:09.807
They were outside
wondering what I was doing.

56:09.911 --> 56:13.274
I was in having a good time.
I'm into those things.

56:13.993 --> 56:17.522
These guys waited outside
and the only reason they came in

56:17.626 --> 56:22.367
was because they saw two men with
bulges in their jackets going in.

56:23.043 --> 56:25.907
Well, these guys
were going to commit a robbery.

56:26.011 --> 56:30.373
They watched them, waited for them to
make their move, then foiled a crime.

56:30.478 --> 56:33.460
I did not know what was going on.

56:33.564 --> 56:36.630
I'm freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.

56:36.734 --> 56:41.631
I don't know what you teach them,
but they're not just regular cops.

56:41.735 --> 56:43.550
They're supercops.

56:43.654 --> 56:46.733
The only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

56:50.113 --> 56:52.782
Is this what really happened?

56:54.492 --> 56:56.161
No, sir.

56:56.619 --> 56:58.908
Would someone tell me what happened?

57:00.958 --> 57:02.418
Well...

57:03.210 --> 57:07.950
Foley invited us to this bar.
We accepted.

57:08.054 --> 57:10.995
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.

57:11.100 --> 57:13.752
And while we were there,

57:13.856 --> 57:16.126
Foley observed the two suspects

57:16.231 --> 57:18.255
casing the establishment.

57:18.359 --> 57:21.426
And before we knew what was going on,

57:21.530 --> 57:24.438
he'd already disarmed one of them.

57:25.566 --> 57:30.222
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrests, sir.

57:30.326 --> 57:34.606
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance,

57:34.711 --> 57:37.399
but if you want to practise
law enforcement,

57:37.503 --> 57:40.247
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

57:41.333 --> 57:43.864
I understand. I'm sorry.

57:43.968 --> 57:46.740
But before I go
I want you two to know,

57:46.845 --> 57:49.329
the supercops story was working.

57:50.425 --> 57:55.415
OK? It was working
and you guys just messed it up.

57:55.519 --> 58:00.047
I'm trying to figure you guys out,
but I haven't yet. But it's cool.

58:00.152 --> 58:03.643
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie
and it's all right.

58:09.904 --> 58:12.851
You guys are off the case.

58:12.955 --> 58:16.567
Foster, McCabe, your turn.

58:18.413 --> 58:21.782
- Don't lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.

58:23.793 --> 58:26.030
And you two...

58:26.134 --> 58:28.168
In my office.

58:45.607 --> 58:48.478
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?

58:49.486 --> 58:52.440
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.

58:57.661 --> 58:59.903
There he is.

59:16.014 --> 59:18.849
Morning, officers.
You the second team?

59:20.018 --> 59:22.049
We're the first team.

59:22.153 --> 59:24.676
We won't fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

59:24.780 --> 59:28.052
You won't fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?

59:28.156 --> 59:30.976
It should be more natural,
brother, like this.

59:31.080 --> 59:35.310
"I ain't falling for no banana in my
tailpipe." It's more natural for us.

59:35.415 --> 59:39.074
You've been hanging out
with this dude too long.

59:40.289 --> 59:43.788
I'm sorry, I'm just fucking with you.
That's funny to me.

59:44.585 --> 59:48.031
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.

59:48.136 --> 59:51.914
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?
- Yeah, I think so.

59:54.512 --> 59:57.587
I've seen enough.
You want something to drink?

59:57.691 --> 59:59.962
I got some stuff in the trunk.

01:00:00.066 --> 01:00:02.098
Excuse me.

01:00:13.657 --> 01:00:16.936
For a man on vacation,
you look like you're on a stakeout.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.863
Stakeout? No, no. I'm picnicking.
This is a picnic area.

01:00:29.423 --> 01:00:32.498
I've been shooting the shit
long enough.

01:00:32.602 --> 01:00:35.677
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

01:01:27.107 --> 01:01:29.147
What the hell's he doing?

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.407
Can you put this in a good spot?

01:02:30.511 --> 01:02:33.590
This shit happened
last time I parked here.

01:03:01.204 --> 01:03:03.607
May I help you?

01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:06.624
I'm looking for Victor Maitland.

01:03:07.419 --> 01:03:10.116
You realise that
this is a members only club?

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:13.205
I have to talk to Victor.
It's very important.

01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:16.208
- Victor Maitland, are you sure?
- Yes.

01:03:16.312 --> 01:03:19.839
Grey-haired gentleman.
Very dark skin. Capricorn.

01:03:20.892 --> 01:03:24.383
Why don't you give me the message
and I'll take it to him?

01:03:24.487 --> 01:03:29.679
OK. Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago...

01:03:29.783 --> 01:03:32.722
Tell him that
Ramon went to the clinic,

01:03:32.827 --> 01:03:35.850
and I found out that I have...

01:03:35.955 --> 01:03:37.980
herpes simplex 10.

01:03:38.084 --> 01:03:41.522
I think Victor should check himself
out with his physician

01:03:41.626 --> 01:03:44.575
before things start falling off
on the man.

01:03:47.418 --> 01:03:49.626
Perhaps you better tell him that.

01:03:51.924 --> 01:03:55.838
- I think that would be best.
- So do I.

01:04:11.443 --> 01:04:13.483
Hi, Victor.

01:04:15.656 --> 01:04:17.533
I'm back.

01:04:23.832 --> 01:04:26.157
Look, guys, don't even try it.

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:29.657
Why don't you
get the hell out of here?

01:04:29.762 --> 01:04:32.126
Get the fuck away from me, man.

01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:52.687
Very good, Victor. Could you teach
him to roll over and sit, too?

01:04:54.155 --> 01:04:56.602
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

01:04:56.706 --> 01:05:00.779
- Last time, I didn't get the chance.
- I've nothing to say to you.

01:05:01.162 --> 01:05:03.617
That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

01:05:04.874 --> 01:05:07.246
This is a very nice place, Vic.

01:05:07.835 --> 01:05:10.587
Hi. I like this. This is nice.

01:05:11.505 --> 01:05:14.590
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

01:05:17.136 --> 01:05:21.626
Victor, I know that you're into
a lot of crooked shit.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:25.171
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

01:05:25.275 --> 01:05:28.095
And when I find out for sure,

01:05:28.199 --> 01:05:30.343
I'm going to fuck you up real bad.

01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:32.473
Is that so?

01:05:32.577 --> 01:05:35.766
Now listen to me,
my tough little friend.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:39.726
I don't know
from under what stone you crawled

01:05:39.831 --> 01:05:43.273
or where you get
these ridiculous ideas about me,

01:05:43.377 --> 01:05:45.857
but it seems painfully obvious

01:05:45.962 --> 01:05:48.527
you haven't
the slightest fucking idea

01:05:48.631 --> 01:05:50.947
who you're dealing with.

01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:54.288
Now, my advice to you

01:05:54.392 --> 01:05:57.663
is crawl back to your little stone
in Detroit

01:05:57.767 --> 01:06:01.297
before you get squashed, OK?

01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:05.132
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.

01:06:05.236 --> 01:06:08.348
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

01:06:14.362 --> 01:06:16.236
Catch you later, Vic.

01:06:17.115 --> 01:06:19.154
I can't wait.

01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:35.005
Don't I know you guys?
You look so familiar.

01:06:37.469 --> 01:06:40.960
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:44.141
Why are you bothering
Victor Maitland?

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:51.010
I had a friend, Michael Tandino,
who used to work for him.

01:06:51.114 --> 01:06:55.569
Maitland had him killed. When I can
prove it you'll be the first to know.

01:06:57.949 --> 01:07:00.736
Forget what you can prove,
talk to me.

01:07:03.663 --> 01:07:08.153
OK. Listen. Everybody knows Victor
Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:11.448
But I poked around.
Art's not the only thing he deals.

01:07:11.552 --> 01:07:14.287
I saw some guys in his warehouse

01:07:14.392 --> 01:07:16.619
unloading a crate
of German bearer bonds.

01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:20.625
Michael Tandino had bonds
like this on him, coincidentally,

01:07:20.729 --> 01:07:22.753
when he was killed.

01:07:22.857 --> 01:07:25.629
Just because Maitland invests
in the same bonds

01:07:25.733 --> 01:07:27.758
doesn't mean he's a killer.

01:07:27.862 --> 01:07:30.885
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler,

01:07:30.989 --> 01:07:33.053
be it bonds, drugs or whatever.

01:07:33.157 --> 01:07:36.227
The crate I saw
didn't even pass through customs.

01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:38.936
Maitland is paying
to get his shipments out

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.853
before they're inspected.

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:45.403
When his guys get it, they take
the drugs or bonds out of the crates

01:07:45.507 --> 01:07:49.626
and they send it back before customs
even knows what's going on.

01:07:51.462 --> 01:07:55.408
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.

01:07:55.512 --> 01:07:57.750
But I found coffee grounds
everywhere.

01:07:58.928 --> 01:08:02.375
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:05.760
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.

01:08:06.436 --> 01:08:09.223
Very good. Now what do we do?

01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.730
Look, Detective Foley, I...

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.064
I'm sorry.
I'd really like to help you.

01:08:18.198 --> 01:08:20.645
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:24.859
but if your only evidence is coffee,
we can't get a search warrant.

01:08:24.964 --> 01:08:26.986
We can get around that.

01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:30.249
We don't "get around"
search warrants.

01:08:31.587 --> 01:08:35.578
Taggart, I want you
to start checking this out.

01:08:35.682 --> 01:08:38.953
Start with the LAPD,
the FBI and the Customs Service.

01:08:39.058 --> 01:08:43.087
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.

01:08:43.192 --> 01:08:45.462
We snoop around, he'll close down

01:08:45.567 --> 01:08:48.174
and get his shipments from elsewhere.

01:08:48.278 --> 01:08:52.305
Really? Is that what your
extensive experience tells you?

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:55.435
I haven't been on the force...

01:08:56.946 --> 01:08:57.988
Shit.

01:08:59.323 --> 01:09:02.075
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:07.321
The gentleman that crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

01:09:07.425 --> 01:09:11.194
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

01:09:11.299 --> 01:09:12.698
Yes, sir.

01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:15.871
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

01:09:15.975 --> 01:09:19.662
into a gross dereliction of duty

01:09:19.765 --> 01:09:22.670
at a striptease establishment?

01:09:22.774 --> 01:09:25.167
It's Rosewood, sir.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:27.144
Yes, sir.

01:09:27.394 --> 01:09:29.962
Is this the gentleman
who ruined the buffet

01:09:30.068 --> 01:09:31.890
at the Harrow Club today?

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:34.640
Yes, sir.

01:09:34.745 --> 01:09:39.612
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

01:09:43.703 --> 01:09:47.694
Lieutenant,
I'd like to see you in your office.

01:09:47.798 --> 01:09:49.667
Yes, sir.

01:09:53.004 --> 01:09:57.788
Is this the man who wrecked the
buffet at the Harrow Club today?

01:09:57.892 --> 01:10:01.751
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?

01:10:02.263 --> 01:10:04.303
Yes, he can.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:25.855
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

01:10:25.959 --> 01:10:27.986
watch him pack,

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.945
and escort him to the city limits.

01:10:31.049 --> 01:10:33.415
Then you can give him his gun back.

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:39.495
The two charges of disturbing the
peace have been dropped against you.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.080
But if you return to Beverly Hills,

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:44.417
the charges will be reinstated

01:10:44.521 --> 01:10:48.046
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:50.842
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:53.009
He seems to have enough...

01:10:53.113 --> 01:10:55.516
You want to tell that to the chief?

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:59.939
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

01:11:01.575 --> 01:11:03.900
Come on, Axel.

01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:25.250
Right. Let me check on that tomorrow
and get back to you.

01:11:25.355 --> 01:11:27.419
Thank you.

01:11:27.524 --> 01:11:29.677
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:34.435
- Sit down. I'm not interrupting?
- Of course not.

01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:37.682
There's a gentleman in town
from Detroit

01:11:37.786 --> 01:11:40.899
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

01:11:41.659 --> 01:11:46.398
He came by the office yesterday and
asked me all sorts of odd questions.

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.317
Excuse me, darling.

01:11:48.422 --> 01:11:50.901
I believe his name is Foley.

01:11:51.005 --> 01:11:53.154
Since you were a friend of Michael,

01:11:53.259 --> 01:11:56.533
I was wondering
if you knew the fellow.

01:11:56.637 --> 01:11:59.540
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.

01:11:59.644 --> 01:12:01.960
Really? Have you seen him lately?

01:12:03.847 --> 01:12:05.887
He came in yesterday.

01:12:06.642 --> 01:12:09.097
What? He came by here?

01:12:11.773 --> 01:12:12.816
And?

01:12:14.776 --> 01:12:18.109
He told me that Mikey
had been killed.

01:12:19.239 --> 01:12:21.611
Yes. Yes, I know.

01:12:24.369 --> 01:12:27.316
- And then?
- That's it.

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:31.246
He left and I haven't seen him since.

01:12:33.086 --> 01:12:36.449
Jenny, darling,
do you know where he's staying?

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:40.213
I have some information
which might be helpful for him.

01:12:43.597 --> 01:12:45.804
No, I have no idea.

01:12:55.067 --> 01:12:57.304
I hope I didn't disturb you.

01:12:57.408 --> 01:13:00.487
- No problem.
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?

01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:03.946
- That'd be lovely.
- Take care.

01:13:16.214 --> 01:13:20.960
I read the manifests. They're
expecting another shipment in today.

01:13:22.054 --> 01:13:23.457
Bogomil...

01:13:23.561 --> 01:13:27.878
This is a chance for me and you
to blow this case wide open.

01:13:27.982 --> 01:13:30.257
I wish I could, but I can't.

01:13:30.361 --> 01:13:31.404
Why?

01:13:32.272 --> 01:13:34.680
Because Bogomil would kill me.

01:13:39.696 --> 01:13:42.726
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery.

01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:46.566
It's easy. Jenny will let us in
Maitland's warehouse.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:48.861
The shipment arrives, we nail them.

01:13:48.965 --> 01:13:52.197
- How can you be sure it'll be drugs?
- I got a hunch.

01:13:52.301 --> 01:13:57.410
A technique by which many crimes
outside Beverly Hills get solved.

01:13:57.514 --> 01:14:00.582
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:05.460
He does everything by the book.
Is everybody in this town a robot?

01:14:05.565 --> 01:14:08.427
This thing is very personal to me.

01:14:10.269 --> 01:14:13.721
All he asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

01:14:14.524 --> 01:14:17.395
Now I'm going to screw that up, too.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:24.156
Billy, I love you.
I just fell in love with you.

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:29.194
Jenny, how are you?

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.236
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
Jenny Summers.

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:35.531
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

01:14:35.635 --> 01:14:37.616
That's Serge.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.578
Can you get my friend an espresso?

01:14:40.682 --> 01:14:43.083
You want it with a lemon twist?

01:14:44.722 --> 01:14:46.920
Sure, if it's no bother.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.758
No, don't be stupid.

01:14:49.862 --> 01:14:53.427
Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.887
He was acting real weird.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:59.151
Look, I want to get back
inside the warehouse.

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.977
How about I go with you?

01:15:02.082 --> 01:15:05.397
You work in a gallery.
You're not a cop.

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:09.816
If this has to do with Mikey's death,
I want to check it out.

01:15:09.921 --> 01:15:12.037
I don't have time to argue with you.

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:16.872
Let me get my keys
and we'll argue on the way.

01:15:20.509 --> 01:15:24.416
Billy, you sit here and observe.
Don't move till I get you.

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:28.631
- Why can't I come in?
- Cos you're a cop in this town.

01:15:28.735 --> 01:15:31.923
Without probable cause,
it's an illegal search.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:34.635
Didn't they teach you that
in cop school?

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:38.139
- I find some evidence, I'll get you.
- You can't...

01:15:38.244 --> 01:15:44.190
Be cool, all right? If anything
jumps off, I'll come and get you.

01:15:45.326 --> 01:15:48.733
Is there any chance
you'll let me go in by myself?

01:15:48.838 --> 01:15:50.870
No chance.

01:15:52.042 --> 01:15:54.284
Fuck. Come on.

01:16:40.258 --> 01:16:43.749
- Seems they've been already.
- What are you looking for?

01:16:43.853 --> 01:16:44.896
This.

01:16:45.179 --> 01:16:48.963
A crate from overseas that
hasn't passed through customs yet.

01:16:58.193 --> 01:17:00.519
What is that?

01:17:10.873 --> 01:17:12.110
Coffee?

01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:14.449
Yeah, it's coffee on top.

01:17:20.174 --> 01:17:23.331
But this ain't sugar.
Go get Rosewood.

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:25.717
Welcome to the party.

01:17:50.205 --> 01:17:52.577
It seems we have guests.

01:18:13.104 --> 01:18:16.852
How nice. I do like surprises.

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:31.244
Jeannette.

01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:39.045
I just can't tell you how
disappointed I am to find you here.

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:41.967
Shut up!

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.590
I don't want to hear it.

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:06.193
Take her to the car and wait for me.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.648
What are you going to do with him?

01:19:09.752 --> 01:19:14.030
You should be more worried about
what we're going to do with you.

01:19:14.134 --> 01:19:18.159
Don't worry. We've got cocaine and
coffee, we're going to have a party.

01:19:18.263 --> 01:19:21.867
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.

01:19:21.971 --> 01:19:23.793
Did you say something?

01:19:38.567 --> 01:19:41.438
If something happens to her...

01:19:43.113 --> 01:19:45.153
I'm all ears.

01:19:46.575 --> 01:19:48.615
I'll kill you.

01:19:49.745 --> 01:19:53.161
Really? That would be a neat trick.

01:20:05.345 --> 01:20:09.295
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?

01:20:12.394 --> 01:20:17.980
No. But I should have
taken care of you in Detroit.

01:20:23.947 --> 01:20:26.354
When I popped your little buddy.

01:20:33.207 --> 01:20:35.449
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:40.456
- Have a nice day.
- I'll try.

01:21:06.116 --> 01:21:07.784
Damn it.

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:12.247
Oh, boy.

01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:28.291
How's that little bump
on the head I gave you in Detroit?

01:21:28.396 --> 01:21:30.677
Healed up nice, I hope.

01:21:56.459 --> 01:21:57.704
Freeze!

01:22:11.183 --> 01:22:12.226
Thanks.

01:22:27.533 --> 01:22:32.150
Tell Taggart to check out
the warehouse. I'll explain later.

01:22:32.254 --> 01:22:35.237
Sergeant Taggart is here,
he wants to talk to you.

01:22:35.342 --> 01:22:36.363
Shit!

01:22:36.468 --> 01:22:39.364
Billy, what the hell is going on?

01:22:39.469 --> 01:22:43.535
- Sorry, Sarge, I can't talk now.
- What do you mean?

01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:48.289
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

01:22:48.393 --> 01:22:50.957
- He's not transmitting any more.
- Shit.

01:22:51.061 --> 01:22:55.425
- What's the matter?
- Billy's doing something dumb again.

01:22:55.529 --> 01:22:59.177
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.

01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:02.681
Right now, his car's heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

01:23:02.786 --> 01:23:06.390
- We were there this morning.
- What?

01:23:06.495 --> 01:23:08.937
Foley was looking over
Maitland's house.

01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:12.735
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:18.823
Check that place out, let me know
what's going on over there.

01:23:18.928 --> 01:23:20.959
Don't talk to anybody but me.

01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:45.305
Hold it, Foley. You're under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?

01:23:45.409 --> 01:23:48.313
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn't.

01:23:48.418 --> 01:23:52.904
Everything he said about Maitland
is right. He's kidnapped a woman.

01:23:54.664 --> 01:23:57.611
- Let's get her.
- What do you think I'm doing?

01:23:57.715 --> 01:24:01.994
- We'll have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.

01:24:02.098 --> 01:24:04.120
Stop. You're coming with us.

01:24:04.224 --> 01:24:07.715
I'm going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.

01:24:10.389 --> 01:24:14.335
Me, too. You can do what you want,
but I'm going in.

01:24:14.439 --> 01:24:16.838
This is really serious trouble.

01:24:16.942 --> 01:24:19.762
If you're lucky,
you'll just get fired.

01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:22.942
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.

01:24:31.035 --> 01:24:33.158
I'm sorry, Sarge. I've got to.

01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:40.253
Shit. Wait a minute.

01:24:53.934 --> 01:24:57.758
- What's that?
- Looks like East Gate.

01:24:57.862 --> 01:24:59.894
Punch it up.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.405
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:27.082
Where is everybody? Is Rosewood back?

01:25:27.186 --> 01:25:29.624
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?

01:25:29.728 --> 01:25:32.010
He took off about 10 minutes ago.

01:25:41.066 --> 01:25:43.097
Foley's on the grounds.

01:25:43.201 --> 01:25:47.737
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.

01:25:50.159 --> 01:25:53.030
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:26.066
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.

01:26:37.207 --> 01:26:38.875
Come on.

01:27:02.442 --> 01:27:07.264
- They must be away from the car.
- I can see that. Keep trying.

01:27:07.368 --> 01:27:10.448
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

01:27:14.454 --> 01:27:16.274
609 Palm Canyon Road.

01:27:16.378 --> 01:27:18.828
Who lives at that address?

01:27:21.962 --> 01:27:24.002
A Victor Maitland, sir.

01:27:27.217 --> 01:27:31.630
- Let's go around.
- Come on, we can do it. Come on.

01:27:37.061 --> 01:27:39.630
Ready, one, two...

01:27:39.734 --> 01:27:40.981
three!

01:28:11.221 --> 01:28:13.260
You all right?

01:28:16.434 --> 01:28:18.676
What the fuck am I doing here?

01:28:25.069 --> 01:28:26.737
Drop it!

01:28:35.621 --> 01:28:38.077
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

01:28:48.759 --> 01:28:51.584
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.

01:28:51.688 --> 01:28:54.134
I hate machine guns.

01:29:02.774 --> 01:29:04.651
Cover me.

01:29:17.831 --> 01:29:20.915
Go around front.
I'm going to check the back.

01:29:22.586 --> 01:29:27.997
We have a report of shots fired at
that location. 609 Palm Canyon Road.

01:29:28.102 --> 01:29:30.917
Put out a 998,
officers need assistance.

01:29:31.021 --> 01:29:33.043
- Undercovers on scene.
- Sir?

01:29:33.147 --> 01:29:38.045
I want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.

01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:41.809
- Damn! Let's go.
- Undercover officers at location.

01:29:50.865 --> 01:29:53.190
Police! You're all under arrest!

01:29:59.541 --> 01:30:02.115
Do that again, I'll shoot you myself.

01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:17.280
Know what I keep thinking about?

01:31:17.913 --> 01:31:20.535
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?

01:31:22.626 --> 01:31:26.126
Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:32.511
And the whole Bolivian army
is out in front of this little hut.

01:31:36.933 --> 01:31:39.685
I'm going to make you pay for this.

01:32:58.642 --> 01:33:00.516
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.

01:33:28.256 --> 01:33:30.712
Freeze it! Hold it right there.

01:33:33.928 --> 01:33:34.971
Shit!

01:33:53.532 --> 01:33:56.237
Be careful, old boy,
it might hit me.

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.420
Freeze!

01:34:24.398 --> 01:34:27.261
Police! You're all under arrest!

01:34:27.365 --> 01:34:33.148
Lay down your weapons and take
two steps back with your hands up!

01:34:38.286 --> 01:34:40.319
Very good.

01:34:40.423 --> 01:34:41.466
Great.

01:35:00.727 --> 01:35:02.841
What the hell's going on here?

01:35:02.945 --> 01:35:03.988
Shit.

01:35:04.188 --> 01:35:08.095
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.140
How come he isn't wearing cuffs?

01:35:11.244 --> 01:35:14.395
Well, he isn't actually
in custody, sir.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.233
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?

01:35:17.337 --> 01:35:20.613
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

01:35:22.041 --> 01:35:25.781
You have a report
that explains all this?

01:35:25.885 --> 01:35:27.755
Yes, sir.

01:35:28.338 --> 01:35:31.209
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

01:35:34.386 --> 01:35:38.210
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager
of Mr Maitland's art gallery,

01:35:38.314 --> 01:35:42.047
accidentally discovered
what she suspected was cocaine

01:35:42.151 --> 01:35:43.966
in the gallery's warehouse.

01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:48.560
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley.

01:35:50.612 --> 01:35:52.848
Detective Foley was, at the time,

01:35:52.953 --> 01:35:57.853
cooperating in a joint
Beverly Hills-Detroit investigation.

01:35:57.958 --> 01:36:02.275
Detectives Foley and Rosewood
proceeded to the warehouse

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:06.241
where Rosewood discovered
approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:11.798
Rosewood called for back-up
and I despatched our officers.

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:15.256
Sergeant Taggart
was the first on the scene.

01:36:16.055 --> 01:36:20.672
Believing a felony was in progress,
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,

01:36:20.776 --> 01:36:23.965
with Detective Foley present
only as an observer,

01:36:24.069 --> 01:36:26.383
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

01:36:26.487 --> 01:36:29.973
In defending ourselves,
we shot several suspects,

01:36:30.077 --> 01:36:32.524
including Mr Maitland.

01:36:36.158 --> 01:36:38.910
You expect me to believe that report?

01:36:40.329 --> 01:36:43.116
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

01:36:45.335 --> 01:36:50.293
Sergeant Taggart,
why don't you tell me what happened?

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.770
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, Chief.

01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:23.366
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

01:37:25.543 --> 01:37:27.364
Thank you, sir.

01:37:27.468 --> 01:37:30.241
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

01:37:30.346 --> 01:37:32.628
Yes, sir. First thing.

01:37:40.933 --> 01:37:43.341
You were lying your ass off.

01:37:46.814 --> 01:37:50.101
Go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at.

01:37:51.153 --> 01:37:53.276
Excuse me, sir.

01:37:57.868 --> 01:38:00.573
Could you do me a favour, sir?

01:38:01.997 --> 01:38:05.859
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:09.034
I just hoped you could
call Inspector Todd

01:38:09.139 --> 01:38:12.243
and straighten things out for me,
but that's all right.

01:38:12.347 --> 01:38:14.577
I'm out of a job. It's cool.

01:38:14.682 --> 01:38:16.830
I think I'll stay in Beverly Hills.

01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:20.014
I'm going to start
a private investigation company.

01:38:21.017 --> 01:38:23.676
I'll talk to Todd first thing.

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.590
- Really?
- You bet.

01:38:25.695 --> 01:38:26.737
Thank you so much.

01:38:35.115 --> 01:38:37.894
Hi, I'm Axel Foley
checking out of suite 1035.

01:38:37.999 --> 01:38:40.530
One moment, sir. I'll get your bill.

01:38:44.958 --> 01:38:48.903
Guys, you didn't have to come
to see me off, but I'm very moved.

01:38:49.008 --> 01:38:53.085
Bogomil ordered us to make sure
you got out of town.

01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:57.914
That doesn't matter. What matters
is that you came down here.

01:38:58.019 --> 01:39:01.171
I'm all choked up.
I've got a lump in my throat.

01:39:01.275 --> 01:39:04.047
Look a little misty yourself,
Taggart.

01:39:04.151 --> 01:39:06.214
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.

01:39:06.319 --> 01:39:10.304
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

01:39:10.408 --> 01:39:14.557
Get outta here.
Guys, that's the last straw.

01:39:14.661 --> 01:39:16.686
You guys are too nice.

01:39:16.791 --> 01:39:19.063
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?

01:39:19.167 --> 01:39:23.068
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.

01:39:23.172 --> 01:39:26.498
I have to have two of them, though.

01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:30.128
Billy, you saved my life.

01:39:31.006 --> 01:39:34.701
I'll never be able to repay you,
but as a token of my appreciation,

01:39:34.805 --> 01:39:37.287
I want you to have
this fine Beverly Palm robe.

01:39:37.391 --> 01:39:41.877
Each time you get in the shower,
think about our friendship.

01:39:41.981 --> 01:39:44.893
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.803
Thanks, Axel.

01:39:51.907 --> 01:39:56.558
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

01:39:56.663 --> 01:39:58.899
Billy, take care of the tab.

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:01.608
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.

01:40:01.713 --> 01:40:03.857
This is for you.

01:40:03.962 --> 01:40:07.041
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:11.754
I already have three of them
in my bag.

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:16.916
Thank you, sir.

01:40:17.021 --> 01:40:19.542
Not going to say goodbye?

01:40:19.646 --> 01:40:22.836
Aren't you tailing me
to the city limits?

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:25.798
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

01:40:25.902 --> 01:40:28.298
I was thinking
about stopping for a drink.

01:40:28.403 --> 01:40:32.099
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?

01:40:33.362 --> 01:40:36.936
I don't think so, Axel.
We're still on duty.

01:40:37.041 --> 01:40:40.311
I don't think
one beer's going to kill us, Billy.

01:40:40.416 --> 01:40:43.328
Right. Listen to Taggart. Lighten up.

01:40:43.914 --> 01:40:46.037
One drink's not going to kill us.

01:40:47.334 --> 01:40:51.574
But guys, if you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:55.995
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don't worry, just follow my lead.

01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:00.222
I know the perfect place.
You guys'll love it. Trust me.
