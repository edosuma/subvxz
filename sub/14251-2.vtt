01:06.199 --> 01:09.225
So, how's the newest addition
to our family?

01:09.302 --> 01:10.633
At the moment, she's stable,

01:10.703 --> 01:12.398
but the prognosis isn't clear.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.032
Her human physiology has
begun to reassert itself--

01:15.108 --> 01:18.976
respiratory system, neurological
functions, immune response.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.842
But those systems are swarming

01:20.914 --> 01:21.972
with Borg implants.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.676
There's a battle being
waged inside her body

01:24.751 --> 01:27.117
between the biological
and the technological,

01:27.187 --> 01:28.620
and l'm not sure
which is going to win.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.713
Well, it's time
we brought her up- to- date.

01:30.790 --> 01:31.882
Wake her.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.898
Captain Janeway.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.372
What have you...?

01:54.013 --> 01:58.416
The others;
l can't hear the others.

01:58.485 --> 01:59.782
The voices are gone.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.378
We had to neutralize
the neuro- transceiver

02:02.455 --> 02:04.252
in your upper spinal column.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.191
Your link to the collective
has been severed.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.923
You will return this drone
to the Borg.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.429
l'm afraid l can't do that.

02:12.499 --> 02:15.229
You will return this drone
to the Borg!

02:15.301 --> 02:17.098
lf l were to turn
this ship around

02:17.170 --> 02:18.933
and head back
into Borg territory,

02:19.038 --> 02:20.369
l'd be putting my crew at risk.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.873
l'm not prepared to do that.

02:21.941 --> 02:24.501
Try to understand.

02:24.577 --> 02:27.273
You have to stay
on board Voyager,

02:27.347 --> 02:29.872
but l'm offering you freedom
from the collective,

02:29.949 --> 02:31.143
and l assure you,
we'll do everything

02:31.217 --> 02:32.275
we can to help the transition...

02:32.352 --> 02:34.946
You will supply us
with a subspace transmitter

02:35.021 --> 02:37.615
and leave us
on the nearest planet.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.282
The Borg will come for us.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.519
lt's too late for that.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.993
Your human cells
are starting to regenerate.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.587
You won't survive
without medical care.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.327
We need nothing from you.

02:48.401 --> 02:51.495
We are Borg.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.038
We ar...

02:57.844 --> 02:59.869
This implant is being rejected
by the tissue underneath.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.607
lt's going to have
to be removed.

03:01.714 --> 03:04.444
You will suppress
the human immune system!

03:04.484 --> 03:06.247
l'm sorry, but the process
has gone too far.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.616
We've got to get you
to Sick Bay.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.917
No! We are Borg!

03:10.023 --> 03:12.457
We are Borg!

05:09.475 --> 05:11.443
This armor plating
is anchored to the skull

05:11.511 --> 05:13.274
with over 3 million
microconnectors.

05:13.346 --> 05:14.711
There's no time
to cut through them.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.011
l'm going to have to remove the
outer layer of the skull itself.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.814
Lieutenant, will you please
leave the surgical bay!

05:20.887 --> 05:22.752
This Borg is a security risk.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.789
She is heavily sedated.

05:23.856 --> 05:26.120
l assure you,
she's not going anywhere.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.089
Thank you.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.932
Kes, l want you to anesthetize
her cranial nerves.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.628
20 milligrams anetrizine.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.694
Yes, Doctor.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.176
Kes...?

05:44.243 --> 05:46.370
l don't know what happened.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.778
l looked at the hypospray,
and it just came to me.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.817
Have you been experimenting with
your psychokinetic abilities?

05:51.884 --> 05:53.283
No, not for months.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.981
But l have been feeling
a little strange lately--

05:56.055 --> 05:57.852
lots of energy, sleeping less...

05:57.924 --> 05:59.357
l can see why.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.087
Your serotonin levels are
62 percent above normal.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.789
lt's the telepathic centers
of your brain.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.492
They're in a state
of hyperstimulation,

06:07.567 --> 06:09.296
like they were a few days ago,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.701
when you were in contact
with Species 8472.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.534
Are they attempting
to communicate with you again?

06:13.606 --> 06:15.574
No.

06:15.641 --> 06:16.869
This time, it's different.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.342
l don't feel their presence
at all.

06:18.411 --> 06:21.608
Perhaps she's experiencing
an aftereffect of some kind.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.080
A reasonable diagnosis...

06:23.149 --> 06:24.411
for a security officer.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.884
l'll run a full
microsynaptic analysis,

06:26.953 --> 06:28.147
but it will have to wait.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.950
We should get back to our Borg.

06:43.469 --> 06:44.766
Come in.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.328
Ship's status report.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.308
We've got two teams on the hull
stripping off the Borg armor.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.866
They're working
around the clock,

06:51.944 --> 06:53.206
but it's still slow going.

06:53.279 --> 06:54.712
What about the warp drive?

06:54.781 --> 06:57.511
Torres is having problems
cleaning out the plasma relays.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.915
lt's disrupting
the antimatter reaction.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.546
Until she's got it fixed,
we're stuck at impulse.

07:02.655 --> 07:03.986
She's requesting all personnel

07:04.023 --> 07:05.547
with a level- 3
engineering rating or higher

07:05.625 --> 07:06.819
to lend a hand.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.656
Granted.

07:08.728 --> 07:09.820
Tactical update?

07:09.896 --> 07:11.864
Long- range sensors
are picking up

07:11.964 --> 07:14.831
residual transwarp signatures--
Borg vessels.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.369
They passed by
probably three days ago.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.531
So we're not
out of the woods yet.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.699
Having half our propulsion
system overrun by Borg implants

07:22.775 --> 07:24.072
doesn't make repairs
any easier.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.208
Seven of Nine
could help us with that.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.272
That might be true,
if she were willing,

07:30.349 --> 07:32.715
but she's not in
the most cooperative mood.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.152
That could change.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.588
l just have to reach her
somehow.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.488
Annika Hansen.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.258
Our Borg?

07:45.331 --> 07:47.128
lt took some digging

07:47.200 --> 07:48.565
through the Federation database,

07:48.634 --> 07:50.226
but l managed to find
a single entry

07:50.303 --> 07:52.203
in the records of Deep Space 4.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.703
Her parents were...
unconventional.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.971
They fancied themselves
explorers,

07:59.045 --> 08:00.535
but wanted nothing to do
with Starfleet

08:00.613 --> 08:01.545
or the Federation.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.309
Their names were last recorded

08:03.382 --> 08:06.783
at a remote outpost
in the Omega Sector.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.253
They refused to file
a flight plan.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.652
Apparently, they aimed
their small ship

08:12.725 --> 08:15.353
toward the Delta Quadrant,
and were never heard from again.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.554
For all we know,

08:16.629 --> 08:18.494
Annika and her parents
were the first humans

08:18.564 --> 08:21.032
the Borg ever assimilated.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.503
From what she's told me,
that was almost 20 years ago.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.596
So she was raised by the Borg.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.437
lt's the only life
she ever really knew.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.070
lf you were thinking of
bringing her into the fold,

08:33.145 --> 08:34.304
that might not be possible.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.907
What's the alternative--
toss her back to the wolves?

08:38.017 --> 08:40.144
Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.379
What is it, Doctor?

08:41.453 --> 08:42.580
Could you come down here,
Captain?

08:42.655 --> 08:45.351
We're having some...problems.

08:45.424 --> 08:46.516
l'll be right there.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.041
lt's like peeling an onion.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.439
Store it in a biostasis chamber.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.407
lt may still be active.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.009
lf you think
there's a risk, Mr. Tuvok,

09:14.086 --> 09:16.680
you can throw one of your little
force fields around the chamber.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.453
A prudent security measure...
for a Doctor.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.696
Report.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.755
l'm afraid we have
a decision to make--

09:26.832 --> 09:29.323
a difficult one.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.700
Her human immune system
has reasserted itself

09:31.771 --> 09:34.171
with a vengeance--
body armor, Borg organelles

09:34.240 --> 09:37.403
biosynthetic glands--
they're all being rejected.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.103
Her life is in danger.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.475
l have little recourse

09:40.546 --> 09:42.571
but to remove
the Borg technology.

09:42.648 --> 09:45.208
Which is the last thing
Seven of Nine would want.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.047
Hence, the difficult decision.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.553
lf a patient told me
not to treat them--

09:49.622 --> 09:51.556
even if the situation
were life- threatening--

09:51.624 --> 09:54.718
l would be ethically obligated
to honor that request.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.319
This is no ordinary patient.

09:57.396 --> 10:00.058
She may have been raised
by Borg,

10:00.132 --> 10:02.430
raised to think like a Borg...

10:02.501 --> 10:03.934
but she's with us now

10:04.003 --> 10:05.971
and underneath
all that technology,

10:06.072 --> 10:08.506
she is a human being--
whether she's

10:08.574 --> 10:11.441
ready to accept that or not.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.205
And until she is ready,

10:13.279 --> 10:16.271
someone has to make
the decisions for her.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.915
Proceed with the surgery.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.115
Aye, Captain.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.392
Kes.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.199
Let's begin
with the microtubule network

10:41.273 --> 10:43.104
embedded
in the esophageal tract.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.370
What's happening?

10:47.446 --> 10:48.879
l'm not sure.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.514
She's going into neural shock.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.711
l can't localize the source.

10:53.786 --> 10:56.220
Kes, try to stabilize
her motor cortex.

10:56.288 --> 10:57.778
Use a neuro sequencer.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.449
Kes, l said
to stabilize her cortex

11:01.527 --> 11:02.459
or we're going to lose her.

11:02.528 --> 11:03.256
Wait.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.422
l can see it.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.829
What?

11:06.899 --> 11:09.390
l think the problem
is in her colliculi.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.348
Yes...l can see it.

11:25.418 --> 11:29.855
A Borg implant-- it's pressing
against her trochlear nerve.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.152
Can you tell me
how we might remove it

11:32.224 --> 11:33.885
without severing the nerve?

11:33.959 --> 11:36.359
l think l can do more
than tell you.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.537
The implant is deteriorating.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.112
Her nervous system
is stabilizing.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.286
Nice work, Kes.

12:04.356 --> 12:06.517
Unconventional...

12:06.592 --> 12:08.321
but effective.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.572
They say the eye
is the window to the soul.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.545
ln this case,
it's a little bit more.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.639
l fabricated
this artificial organ

12:30.716 --> 12:32.946
to replace her eyepiece,
but l've had

12:33.018 --> 12:34.781
to retain some
of the Borg circuitry

12:34.854 --> 12:35.946
along the optic nerve.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.854
As a result, she'll have
increased acuity in one eye.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.983
Note how perfectly l've matched

12:41.060 --> 12:44.188
the pigment of the iris
to her human eye.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.287
Excellent work, Doctor.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.195
l admire
your attention to detail.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.734
When can l speak with her?

12:49.802 --> 12:52.771
She's out of immediate danger
and l don't plan to resume

12:52.838 --> 12:54.396
the extraction process
until tomorrow.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.441
l can wake her now
if you'd like.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.441
l would.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.175
How are you, Kes?

13:02.248 --> 13:03.738
l feel exhilarated, Captain.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.909
l've never been
so focused in my life.

13:05.985 --> 13:09.011
And my telepathic abilities are
stronger than they've ever been.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.818
Your performance today
was astonishing.

13:11.891 --> 13:15.190
However, your psychokinetic
powers are still undisciplined

13:15.261 --> 13:17.229
and, as a result, unpredictable.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.287
l feel like l'm in control.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.890
Nevertheless, you must
proceed with caution

13:21.967 --> 13:23.491
and with my assistance.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.059
What are you suggesting?

13:25.137 --> 13:29.073
A series of guided meditations
to help her explore the depth

13:29.141 --> 13:30.574
of these new abilities.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.632
Kes?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.974
l'm ready.

13:34.046 --> 13:38.380
Well, then, if you'll excuse us,
we should begin immediately.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.561
Ready when you are, Captain.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.634
Don't be alarmed.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.770
You're in Sick Bay.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.246
You're going to be fine.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.913
What have you done to me?

14:16.989 --> 14:19.514
Your body was rejecting
the Borg technology.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.559
You were dying.

14:20.626 --> 14:23.288
l'm sorry, but we had no choice.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.592
Those are dermaplastic grafts.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.723
They'll help
the regeneration process.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.637
Unacceptable.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.504
You should have let us die.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.084
l couldn't do that.

14:46.151 --> 14:48.847
This drone cannot survive
outside the collective.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.320
l beg to differ.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.516
Now that the Borg implants
are being excised,

14:52.591 --> 14:55.424
your human systems are free
to thrive and thriving they are.

14:55.494 --> 14:56.961
As a matter of fact, l...

15:00.065 --> 15:01.623
l want to help you,

15:01.700 --> 15:03.861
but l need to understand
what you're going through.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.062
Do not engage us

15:05.137 --> 15:07.264
in superficial
attempts at sympathy.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.466
lt's obvious
that you're in pain,

15:09.541 --> 15:10.565
that you're frightened,

15:10.643 --> 15:13.908
that you feel isolated, alone.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.470
You are an individual.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.712
You are small.

15:20.786 --> 15:25.416
You cannot understand
what it is to be Borg.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.585
No, but l can imagine.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.263
You were part
of a vast consciousness,

15:33.332 --> 15:36.062
billions of minds
working together,

15:36.135 --> 15:38.365
a harmony
of purpose and thought--

15:38.437 --> 15:40.598
no indecision, no doubts.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.803
The security and strength
of a unified will--

15:46.011 --> 15:47.808
and you've lost that.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.148
This drone is small now.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.914
Alone.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.989
One voice.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.856
One mind.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.995
The silence is unacceptable.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.326
We need the others.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.093
l can't give you
back to the Borg,

16:08.167 --> 16:09.464
but you're not alone.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.628
You're part
of a human community now--

16:11.704 --> 16:13.638
a human collective.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.903
We may be individuals,
but we live and work together.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.104
You can have some
of the unity you require

16:20.179 --> 16:21.874
right here on Voyager.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.075
lnsufficient.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.911
lt'll have to do.

16:31.156 --> 16:34.216
And the fact is,
this community needs you.

16:34.293 --> 16:37.126
The Borg modifications
you made to our vessel

16:37.196 --> 16:39.391
are disrupting our warp drive.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.456
We need your help
to remove them--

16:43.168 --> 16:45.898
your...expertise.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.768
Your cooperation.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.071
You must comply.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.377
All right.

16:59.451 --> 17:01.180
l think l've got
all the Borg garbage

17:01.286 --> 17:02.878
out of the plasma
intake manifold.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.219
Let's try reinitializing
the antimatter reaction.

17:13.165 --> 17:18.000
Matter/antimatter reaction
at 22 Cochranes and rising.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.002
Damn! What happened?

17:25.077 --> 17:28.273
lntake manifolds 1 1 and 13
are still blocked.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.507
This is like pulling weeds.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.071
You think you've got
them all out, and then...

17:31.150 --> 17:32.742
You have neglected
to remove the autonomous

17:32.818 --> 17:34.547
regeneration sequencers.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.078
Lieutenant Torres, Ensign Kim,
you remember Seven of Nine.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.284
How could we forget?

17:40.359 --> 17:42.452
We can't afford to delay
repairs any longer.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.656
So l've asked her to help us
remove the Borg modifications.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.722
She only has a few hours
before she returns to Sick Bay.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.495
l suggest you
put her to good use.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.160
You can start
with the plasma relays.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.430
They're in Jefferies Tube 13...

17:52.504 --> 17:55.098
Jefferies Tube
13- Alpha, Section 12.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.165
We fully recall
the engineering specifications

17:57.242 --> 17:58.300
of your vessel.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.937
Good. Can you also recall
the way it looked

18:01.013 --> 18:03.208
before you turned it
into a Borg circus?

18:04.450 --> 18:05.474
Yes.

18:07.186 --> 18:09.120
Well, now that the pleasantries
are over,

18:09.188 --> 18:10.382
why don't you get to work?

18:10.456 --> 18:12.583
l want updates every hour.

18:12.658 --> 18:15.058
Yes, Captain.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.400
The flame of the lamp
is fire disciplined--

18:24.470 --> 18:27.064
tamed and under control.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.836
lt is the appropriate focus
for the task ahead of us.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.809
How do we begin?

18:32.878 --> 18:36.712
l will attempt to guide you
in manipulating the flame

18:36.782 --> 18:38.215
at the subatomic level.

18:40.252 --> 18:45.189
Concentrate on the flame--
try to see past

18:45.257 --> 18:47.919
the surface...
past the light...

18:48.026 --> 18:50.654
to the patterns
of energy and matter.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.328
l can see the essence
of the fire.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.369
Good.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.428
Now, reach out with your mind

19:00.506 --> 19:01.564
and intensify the flame.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.549
l'm making it hotter,
brighter.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.752
Now, with your thoughts...

19:19.825 --> 19:21.019
reduce the flame.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.327
Excellent.

19:32.404 --> 19:36.306
You've never demonstrated
this level of control before.

19:36.375 --> 19:40.607
lt's as though l knew
what had to be done and...

19:43.415 --> 19:44.382
What's wrong?

19:44.449 --> 19:46.314
Something's happening.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.754
l can see further,
beyond the subatomic.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.683
Kes, there is nothing
beyond the subatomic.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.888
But l can see it, Tuvok.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.859
lt's a new level of reality.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.737
lt's beautiful.

20:11.443 --> 20:14.435
Perhaps we should stop for now.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.140
Wait a few seconds.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.080
l want to try to control it.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.756
Don't worry, Tuvok.

20:42.874 --> 20:44.808
What about these linkages?

20:44.876 --> 20:45.934
Every time l pull one out,

20:46.011 --> 20:47.478
another one
comes back in its place.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.810
Autonomous regeneration
sequencers.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.906
They function
to counteract resistance.

20:51.984 --> 20:52.973
Amazing.

20:53.051 --> 20:53.983
How did you come up

20:54.052 --> 20:55.383
with the pattern-
duplication design?

20:55.454 --> 20:56.716
We came up with nothing.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.688
The Borg assimilated
this technology

20:58.757 --> 21:00.884
in Galactic Cluster 3
from Species 259.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.325
l'm not interested
in a history lesson.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.828
How do we disable it?

21:04.896 --> 21:07.160
You must disconnect
each sequencer conduit

21:07.232 --> 21:08.699
at the insertion juncture.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.394
Why don't you two work
in the Jefferies tube?

21:10.469 --> 21:12.096
Start with the plasma relays.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.371
l'll start here.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.713
You said the Borg got this stuff
from Species 259.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.345
Who were they?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.485
l guess the Borg meet
a lot of people, don't they?

21:40.465 --> 21:41.659
Stupid question.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.740
So what's it like out there
in Galactic Cluster 3?

21:48.807 --> 21:51.537
Beyond your comprehension.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.043
Try me.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.713
Galactic Cluster 3
is a transmaterial energy plane

21:58.784 --> 22:01.753
intersecting 22 billion
omnicordial life- forms.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.223
Oh. lnteresting.

22:24.142 --> 22:26.042
Ensign Kim, your assistance.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.542
Captain, somebody's
trying to access

22:34.619 --> 22:36.416
the subspace transmitter.

22:38.757 --> 22:39.917
Captain, l don't know how,

22:39.991 --> 22:42.687
but she's erected some kind
of force field around the door.

22:42.761 --> 22:43.921
We can't break through it.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.326
She's bypassed
our security protocols.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.558
Disable the transmitter.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.463
lt's too late.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.002
lt's obvious your mental
abilities have progressed

22:52.070 --> 22:54.038
beyond this particular
Vulcan exercise.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.368
l suggest we...

22:58.443 --> 22:59.410
What is it?

22:59.478 --> 23:00.536
Something's wrong.

23:02.948 --> 23:06.008
The Borg is trying
to contact her people.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.581
Tuvok to Security Team 1.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.178
lntruder alert in Engineering.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.780
Wait.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.724
l think l can stop her.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.208
lt's over.

23:37.682 --> 23:38.774
Tuvok to Bridge.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.976
Status?

23:40.051 --> 23:42.178
There was some kind of explosion
in the Jefferies tube

23:42.254 --> 23:44.279
just as she was about
to initiate her transmission.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.756
We don't know what caused it.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.692
l believe l may
have the answer, Captain.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.105
l can tell by the expression
on your face,

24:01.206 --> 24:02.639
that you've got some bad news.

24:02.674 --> 24:05.074
l have no expression on my face.

24:05.143 --> 24:07.270
However, you are correct.

24:07.345 --> 24:09.836
The news on two separate fronts
is not good.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.179
l checked
the subspace bandwidths.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.912
At least a partial signal
was transmitted from Voyager.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.749
Enough for a Borg ship to track?

24:16.822 --> 24:17.754
Possibly.

24:17.823 --> 24:18.915
And the second front?

24:19.024 --> 24:22.255
l believe there's also
cause for concern regarding Kes.

24:22.327 --> 24:23.351
Explain.

24:24.429 --> 24:26.522
lnternal sensor logs show
that she destabilized

24:26.598 --> 24:28.759
the Jefferies tube
at the molecular level.

24:28.834 --> 24:29.892
The effect weakened

24:29.968 --> 24:31.663
the infrastructure
throughout the deck.

24:31.736 --> 24:35.137
She wishes to develop
her abilities further.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.698
l am not certain
it would be safe...

24:37.776 --> 24:39.368
for Kes or Voyager.

24:39.444 --> 24:42.140
l've got an Ocampan
who wants to be something more

24:42.214 --> 24:44.512
and a Borg who's afraid
of becoming something less.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.073
Here's to Vulcan stability.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.450
Wait for me.

25:02.801 --> 25:05.531
So this is human freedom.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.834
l've decided to keep you
in the brig

25:07.906 --> 25:10.875
until l'm certain
you won't try to harm us again.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.672
lf necessary, the Doctor
can treat you here.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.440
l honestly believed
you were going to help us.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.916
You were not deceived,
Captain Janeway.

25:19.985 --> 25:22.078
lt was my intention to help you.

25:22.153 --> 25:23.677
What happened?

25:23.755 --> 25:26.315
There was a chance
to contact the collective.

25:26.391 --> 25:27.756
l took advantage of it.

25:31.563 --> 25:35.829
Your attempts to assimilate
this drone will fail.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.392
You can alter our physiology,

25:38.470 --> 25:41.439
but you cannot
change our nature.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.599
We will betray you.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.768
We are Borg.

25:47.245 --> 25:50.681
l've met Borg who were freed
from the collective.

25:50.749 --> 25:53.946
lt wasn't easy for them
to accept their individuality,

25:54.019 --> 25:55.919
but, in time, they did.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.579
You're no different.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.284
Granted, you were assimilated
at a very young age

26:00.358 --> 26:02.019
and your transition
may be more difficult,

26:02.093 --> 26:04.653
but it will happen.

26:12.103 --> 26:18.474
lf it does happen,
we will become fully human?

26:18.543 --> 26:21.444
Yes, l hope so.

26:22.614 --> 26:26.141
We will be autonomous,
independent.

26:26.217 --> 26:31.484
That's what individuality
is all about.

26:31.556 --> 26:36.721
lf at that time, we choose
to return to the collective,

26:36.795 --> 26:38.990
will you permit it?

26:41.366 --> 26:44.301
l don't think
you'll want to do that.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.934
You would deny us the choice,

26:54.045 --> 26:56.070
as you deny us now.

26:56.147 --> 26:59.583
You have imprisoned us
in the name of humanity,

26:59.651 --> 27:00.982
yet you will not grant us

27:01.086 --> 27:03.350
your most"cherished"
human right--

27:03.388 --> 27:06.186
to choose our own fate.

27:07.392 --> 27:11.351
You are hypocritical,
manipulative.

27:12.764 --> 27:17.133
We do not want to be
what you are!

27:17.202 --> 27:18.669
Return us to the collective!

27:19.804 --> 27:22.204
You lost the capacity
to make a rational choice

27:22.273 --> 27:23.797
the moment you were assimilated.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.843
They took that from you.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.845
And until l'm convinced you've
gotten it back...

27:28.913 --> 27:31.313
l'm making the choice for you.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.874
You're staying here.

27:33.952 --> 27:37.820
Then you are no different
than the Borg.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.192
Talaxian champagne.

27:46.264 --> 27:48.027
Moon- ripened.

27:48.099 --> 27:49.930
Your favorite.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.935
Neelix, where did you get this?

27:52.037 --> 27:54.631
l put a bottle away...

27:54.706 --> 27:57.937
for a special occasion.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.978
Remember when we last
sipped this together?

28:01.046 --> 28:03.446
Three years ago.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.676
lt was when we first
arrived on Voyager.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.843
And do you remember
the toast l made?

28:07.952 --> 28:10.580
Yes.
"To the adventure."

28:10.655 --> 28:12.816
"To the adventure."

28:19.664 --> 28:21.791
When you left Ocampa,

28:21.866 --> 28:25.358
you said that your people
were being held back.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.870
That if you were
only given the chance,

28:26.938 --> 28:29.839
you could become
something so much more.

28:29.908 --> 28:31.876
And you have.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.036
l know things haven't worked out
exactly the way we planned.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.445
l was only holding you back.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.911
That's obvious to me now.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.283
No. l couldn't have come
this far without you.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.818
And l love you.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.453
l always will.

28:51.529 --> 28:53.827
lt's just, uh...

28:58.903 --> 29:01.667
My cooking.
You've always hated my cooking.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.208
That's exactly what it was.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.540
Ah...

29:09.614 --> 29:12.742
So tell me more
about what's happening to you.

29:12.817 --> 29:14.307
What does it all mean?

29:14.385 --> 29:18.651
l don't know, and that's
what makes it so exciting.

29:18.723 --> 29:20.247
lt's as if l can see
into a place

29:20.325 --> 29:26.389
where the distinction between
matter and energy and thought

29:26.464 --> 29:27.624
no longer exists.

29:27.699 --> 29:30.600
And that's only the beginning.

29:30.668 --> 29:33.034
l feel as if all the boundaries
within me

29:33.104 --> 29:34.435
are about to fall away.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.167
lt sounds...

29:39.811 --> 29:41.836
er...uh...interesting.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.710
l only have to look
at an object,

29:43.782 --> 29:46.910
gaze at it,
and l can begin to see...

29:46.985 --> 29:49.453
that the space between the atoms

29:49.521 --> 29:52.456
is being filled
with something else.

29:56.027 --> 29:57.722
Uh, Kes...

29:57.796 --> 30:00.390
l can see...l see...

30:05.436 --> 30:07.028
Uh, Kes, stop!

30:07.105 --> 30:08.072
No.

30:09.774 --> 30:10.798
Neelix!

30:12.443 --> 30:14.707
Captain, l'm picking up
some strange energy readings

30:14.779 --> 30:15.973
from Deck 2, the Mess Hall.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.947
Bridge to Neelix.
What's going on down there?

30:19.417 --> 30:20.509
Neelix, report.

30:20.585 --> 30:22.519
The bulkhead in that section
is coming apart.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.885
lncrease the structural
integrity field of Deck 2.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.014
Tuvok.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.489
l've run every conceivable
neural analysis--

30:59.557 --> 31:02.185
everything short
of dissecting the brain itself.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.659
Her telesynaptic
activity is increasing,

31:04.696 --> 31:07.096
but l don't know why,
or how to stop it.

31:07.165 --> 31:10.032
Have the ship's internal
sensors revealed anything?

31:10.101 --> 31:12.433
For 17. 4 seconds,
Kes's body went

31:12.503 --> 31:14.630
into a state of cellular flux.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.573
She began to destabilize
at the subatomic level.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.109
And for some reason,

31:19.177 --> 31:20.974
her atoms
reestablished their bonds

31:21.045 --> 31:22.478
and she was back in one piece.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.071
But what about the next time?

31:24.148 --> 31:25.638
Her condition is escalating.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.378
We must find
a way to suppress it

31:27.452 --> 31:29.443
or the last we'll see of Kes
could very well be

31:29.520 --> 31:31.750
her molecules blowing
through the ventilation ducts.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.485
Tuvok, enhance the structural
integrity fields

31:34.559 --> 31:35.719
throughout the ship.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.921
lf she has another incident,
l'd like to avoid a hull breach.

31:38.997 --> 31:43.957
Doctor, maybe it's time
we broaden our horizons.

31:44.035 --> 31:47.232
This appears to have gone
beyond medical science.

31:47.305 --> 31:49.205
We're into particle physics now.

31:49.274 --> 31:50.206
l'll try looking

31:50.275 --> 31:51.970
through the quantum
substructure database.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.511
Maybe it'll give me
some...inspiration.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.910
Keep me informed.

32:06.291 --> 32:10.489
Kes, until l can devise
another diagnostic procedure,

32:10.561 --> 32:12.358
you're free to return
to your quarters.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.058
Actually, l'd like to stay here,
help with the research.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.260
l don't want you
to overexert yourself

32:17.335 --> 32:20.327
and risk precipitating
another telepathic incident.

32:20.405 --> 32:21.702
Try to get some rest.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.071
Just let me stay a little while.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.906
l haven't seen you much
over the past few days.

32:26.978 --> 32:27.910
l miss you.

32:27.979 --> 32:31.437
All right, just for a while.

32:53.504 --> 32:54.698
Ensign Ayala to the Bridge.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.000
Go ahead, Ensign.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.905
You'd better come
down to the brig, ma'am.

32:59.510 --> 33:00.602
One.

33:03.281 --> 33:04.509
One.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.916
My designation
is Seven of Nine...

33:16.995 --> 33:21.227
but the others are gone.

33:21.299 --> 33:24.757
Designations are
no longer relevant.

33:27.305 --> 33:31.241
l am...one.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.971
Yes, you are.

33:34.078 --> 33:39.607
But l cannot function this way--
alone.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.616
You're not alone.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.277
l'm willing to help you.

33:44.389 --> 33:47.756
lf that's true,
you won't do this to me.

33:47.825 --> 33:50.726
Take me back to my own kind.

33:50.795 --> 33:54.891
You are
with your own kind-- humans.

33:54.966 --> 33:57.958
l don't remember being human.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.870
l don't know
what it is to be human.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.185
What are you doing?

34:17.255 --> 34:18.552
l'm coming in.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.716
l'll kill you.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.351
l don't think you will.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.447
Do you remember her?

34:54.525 --> 34:57.756
Her name was Annika Hansen.

34:57.829 --> 35:03.961
She was born on Stardate
25479 at the Tendara Colony.

35:04.035 --> 35:07.027
There's still a lot
we don't know about her.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.539
Did she have any siblings?

35:09.607 --> 35:10.767
Who were her friends?

35:10.842 --> 35:12.275
Where did she go to school?

35:12.343 --> 35:14.277
What was her favorite color?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.476
lrrelevant!

35:22.553 --> 35:25.044
Take me back to the Borg.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.454
l can't do that.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.257
So...quiet.

35:30.328 --> 35:31.454
One voice.

35:31.529 --> 35:35.932
One voice can be stronger
than a thousand voices.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.437
Your mind is independent now
with its own unique identity.

35:40.505 --> 35:43.167
You are forcing
that identity upon me.

35:43.241 --> 35:44.230
lt's not mine.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.935
Oh, yes, it is.

35:46.010 --> 35:48.376
l'm just giving you back
what was stolen from you--

35:48.446 --> 35:50.641
the existence you were denied,

35:50.715 --> 35:52.307
the child
who never had a chance.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.510
That life is yours to live now.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.247
l don't want that life!

35:57.321 --> 35:58.652
lt's what you are.

35:58.723 --> 35:59.849
Don't resist it.

35:59.924 --> 36:00.754
No!

36:07.732 --> 36:08.721
No.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.871
Captain's Log, supplemental.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.807
Warp drive is still off- line

36:20.878 --> 36:23.312
and we don't know whether
the Borg have detected us.

36:23.381 --> 36:26.817
Kes's psychokinetic abilities
continue to damage the ship's

36:26.884 --> 36:28.909
structural integrity,
and as a result,

36:29.020 --> 36:31.284
our defenses
have been compromised.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.883
Come in, Captain.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.352
You wanted to see me?

36:39.430 --> 36:42.831
Oh, Tuvok's meditation lamp.

36:42.900 --> 36:43.924
l was with him when he got it

36:44.001 --> 36:47.129
six years ago,
from a Vulcan master...

36:47.205 --> 36:49.696
who doubled the price when he
saw our Starfleet insignia.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.901
l'm sure it was
the logical thing to do.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.508
l've been thinking
about everything

36:58.583 --> 37:00.380
that's been going on...

37:00.484 --> 37:03.715
and l know what l have to do.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.021
lt's time for me
to leave Voyager.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.616
Oh, Kes...

37:09.694 --> 37:11.491
Something important
is happening to me

37:11.562 --> 37:12.756
and l want to explore it,

37:12.830 --> 37:14.457
but l can't stay here
any longer.

37:14.532 --> 37:15.863
l'm a danger to all of you.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.867
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.961
The Doctor's already working
on a new approach...

37:21.038 --> 37:22.835
Everybody thinks
that what's happening

37:22.907 --> 37:24.033
is a medical condition.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.871
That's not it at all.

37:26.010 --> 37:28.410
l'm going through
a transformation.

37:28.479 --> 37:32.609
l don't know how or why,
but every cell in my body

37:32.683 --> 37:37.211
is telling me that l'm changing
into something more.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.415
But what if it's not true?

37:39.490 --> 37:41.117
What if you're simply
being swept up

37:41.192 --> 37:43.456
in the excitement
of what you think is happening,

37:43.527 --> 37:45.427
but it's not real.

37:45.496 --> 37:48.932
On the basis of a feeling,
an intuition,

37:49.000 --> 37:52.163
you're asking me to let you go?

37:52.236 --> 37:55.228
Quite likely forever?

37:55.306 --> 37:57.570
Kes, l just can't do that.

37:57.642 --> 38:02.409
lt's my decision-- my fate.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.914
Would you really try to stop me?

38:07.485 --> 38:10.079
No.

38:10.154 --> 38:11.416
But argue with you,

38:11.489 --> 38:13.218
even plead with you
to reconsider?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.987
Absolutely,
for as long as it takes.

38:18.896 --> 38:21.763
lt won't work.

38:21.832 --> 38:24.494
Look at me, Captain.

38:24.568 --> 38:26.866
l'm the same Kes
you've always known.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.532
l haven't lost my judgment.

38:30.608 --> 38:34.510
l'm not under
some alien influence.

38:36.781 --> 38:40.911
l believe something crucial
is happening to me

38:40.985 --> 38:42.816
and l want to see it through.

38:45.089 --> 38:47.922
You've lived
most of your life here.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.756
Voyager has been your home...

38:52.630 --> 38:55.394
and you've been
a vital part of this family.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.500
Oh, l'm going to miss you.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.952
Now, all l have to do
is tell the Doctor.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.286
He's not going to be happy.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.052
lt's starting.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.565
Janeway to Bridge.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.792
Chakotay here.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.198
Prepare a shuttle for launch

39:31.268 --> 39:33.532
and have Tuvok
meet me on Deck 6.

39:33.604 --> 39:35.071
Captain?

39:35.139 --> 39:36.606
Kes is leaving us.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.441
Come on.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.610
Captain, l can't stop it.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.690
Janeway to Chakotay.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.522
Beam us directly
to the Shuttle Bay.

39:56.594 --> 40:00.155
The molecules in Kes's body
are destabilizing.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.926
lt's interfering
with the transporter.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.864
Captain, we can't get a lock.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.923
Acknowledged.

40:05.002 --> 40:07.402
Looks like we're going to have
to do this the hard way.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.341
What's happening?

40:18.416 --> 40:19.747
The hull is destabilizing.

40:19.817 --> 40:22.251
The molecular bonds
are breaking down.

40:25.322 --> 40:26.311
Tuvok...

40:32.463 --> 40:33.987
l can't keep going.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.432
l will attempt a mind- meld

40:38.502 --> 40:40.629
to help you delay
the transformation.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.673
Our minds are one.

40:46.143 --> 40:48.873
Our thoughts are one.

40:48.946 --> 40:52.245
Try to regain control...

40:52.316 --> 40:54.250
for a moment.

40:54.318 --> 40:56.752
Only for a moment.

40:56.821 --> 40:59.915
Only for...a moment.

41:04.962 --> 41:05.986
You must hurry.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.593
Hull breach on Decks 3, 4 and 5.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.763
Emergency containment fields.

41:14.839 --> 41:18.434
Janeway to the Bridge.
Kes is aboard the shuttle.

41:18.509 --> 41:19.669
lnitiate launch sequence.

41:19.743 --> 41:21.711
Acknowledged.

41:26.283 --> 41:28.945
Shuttle distance:
100, 000 kilometers.

41:29.019 --> 41:30.509
Speed: one- quarter impulse.

41:34.124 --> 41:35.386
Can you hail her?

41:35.459 --> 41:36.983
l've been trying.

41:37.061 --> 41:37.993
lt's happening.

41:38.095 --> 41:40.893
lt's happening to me.

41:40.965 --> 41:43.559
Her atomic structure
is completely destabilizing.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.236
My gift to you.

42:01.018 --> 42:01.916
Torres to Bridge.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.247
The warp core just came on- line.

42:03.320 --> 42:06.517
Matter/antimatter reaction
at 102 percent...

42:06.590 --> 42:08.785
1 10 percent?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.827
120!

42:14.632 --> 42:16.031
This can't be right.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.294
Our speed is...

42:17.368 --> 42:18.335
lt's impossible!

42:19.403 --> 42:20.427
We're coming apart!

42:28.779 --> 42:31.145
We've just dropped out of...

42:31.215 --> 42:32.546
whatever it was we were in.

42:32.616 --> 42:34.379
Systems coming back on line.

42:34.451 --> 42:35.975
On screen.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.151
Where are we?

42:40.224 --> 42:44.593
9. 5 thousand light- years
from where we just were.

42:48.098 --> 42:51.465
She's thrown us safely
beyond Borg space.

42:53.237 --> 42:55.705
Ten years closer to home.

43:19.563 --> 43:22.794
l've extracted 82 percent
of the Borg hardware.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.800
The remaining
bio- implants are stable

43:24.868 --> 43:27.166
and better than anything
l could synthesize

43:27.237 --> 43:28.397
at such short notice.

43:31.308 --> 43:33.333
lt is acceptable.

43:33.410 --> 43:35.469
Fashion, of course,
is hardly my forte.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.980
Nevertheless, l've
managed to balance

43:38.048 --> 43:41.347
functionality and aesthetics
in a pleasing enough manner.

43:41.418 --> 43:42.442
l also took the liberty

43:42.519 --> 43:44.146
of stimulating
your hair follicles--

43:44.221 --> 43:47.281
a vicarious experience for me,
as you might imagine.

43:52.363 --> 43:54.126
You'll have to spend
a few hours each day

43:54.198 --> 43:56.189
regenerating in a Borg alcove
until your human

43:56.266 --> 43:57.790
metabolism can function
on its own.

43:57.868 --> 43:59.631
We'll leave one operational.

43:59.703 --> 44:00.829
Understood.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.403
Let's see how things go
over the next few weeks.

44:04.475 --> 44:08.275
l'll consider granting you
access to the rest of the ship

44:08.345 --> 44:10.279
once l can trust
that you won't try

44:10.347 --> 44:12.212
to get us all assimilated again.

44:13.784 --> 44:15.115
lt will not happen again.

44:17.521 --> 44:20.149
Good.

44:20.224 --> 44:23.352
lf you need anything,
contact me.

44:27.798 --> 44:29.060
Red.

44:29.133 --> 44:30.600
What?

44:30.668 --> 44:34.069
The child you spoke of...
the girl.

44:34.138 --> 44:36.732
Her favorite color was red.
