WEBVTT

03:13.715 --> 03:16.108
That's good whiskey
you're wasting.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.982
Been away a few days, Tom.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.246
How'd you find me, Ranger?

03:23.290 --> 03:26.031
Hound got your scent
back at the ranch.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.599
Shit, I smelled you
from miles away.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.602
Who am I supposed
to have pissed off anyhow?

03:31.646 --> 03:35.389
Hey, you done violated
the conditions of your parole.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.912
Like hell I did.

03:38.130 --> 03:42.483
Assault, brandishing
a firearm in a public place.

03:42.526 --> 03:47.966
You stole a horse, rifle,
whiskey from your employer.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.490
You want me to go on?

03:49.533 --> 03:50.578
That's my rifle.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.493
What business do you have

03:52.536 --> 03:55.496
with a 10,000-dollar
plains rifle, Tom?

03:56.453 --> 03:59.108
Oh, saddle up son.
You're done.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.981
Try to run, I'll kill ya.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.941
Hunting to feed
my family, Ranger.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.030
Too bad it ain't
hunting season.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.686
And you're just
more trash

04:11.729 --> 04:14.079
from Terlingua County
like me, Tom.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.473
Stop pretending
to be what you ain't.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.649
<i>Tyree, you got your ears on, buddy? Where you at, partner?</i>

04:18.693 --> 04:20.129
About 15 miles south

04:20.172 --> 04:23.219
of Manse Point
over Alkali Flats.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.483
Just picked up Tom
that stole a horse and rifle

04:26.527 --> 04:28.485
and beat Joe Hansons.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.487
What can I do for you, Elmer?

04:30.531 --> 04:33.882
<i>10-65, old Mutual Bank
over here in Mount Verde</i>

04:33.925 --> 04:36.711
<i>got themselves held up
about a half hour ago.</i>

04:36.754 --> 04:38.452
<i>Four heavily armed gunmen</i>

04:38.495 --> 04:40.323
<i>driving one of them
off-road type rigs</i>

04:40.367 --> 04:42.499
<i>came in raising
all manners of hell.</i>

04:42.543 --> 04:45.981
<i>Got a 10-99 code on it.
Killed three officers.</i>

04:46.024 --> 04:48.549
<i>Even put old Ben Copper's boy
in the ER,</i>

04:48.592 --> 04:51.160
<i>so figured they'd be heading
your direction there, Alex.</i>

04:51.203 --> 04:52.422
<i>Watch your six, buddy.</i>

05:06.088 --> 05:08.351
<i>10-22, subjects are armed with automatic weapons.</i>

05:08.395 --> 05:10.353
<i>At present, no other units
are available to assist you.</i>

05:10.397 --> 05:13.356
10-24, we got eyes
on that 10-80.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.750
Avenue J, outside of El Paso.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.012
We are currently in pursuit.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.405
<i>10-22, to confirm,</i>

05:18.448 --> 05:21.146
<i>four subjects carrying AK-47s.</i>

05:21.190 --> 05:23.148
Left on Avenue 245.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.327
Whoo, they're coming in hot.
Watch it, watch it.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.416
Ooh, this sumbitch is flying.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.156
Come on, man,
you gonna lose 'em.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.914
<i>10-22,
we have a chopper inbound. ETA: 17 minutes.</i>

05:49.958 --> 05:52.003
Let's go. Gas, gas, gas!
Let's go!

06:06.191 --> 06:08.803
10-24, we lost 'em.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.587
They're heading
southbound on Terlingua.

06:11.588 --> 06:12.546
Shit.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.298
<i>10-22 has broken pursuit.</i>

06:26.342 --> 06:30.259
<i>Suspects were last seen headed
southbound on Terlingua Street.</i>

06:34.350 --> 06:35.960
One suspect has left
the vehicle.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.309
We are going to engage.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.616
"And there before me
was a white horse.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.749
Its rider was named Death

06:41.792 --> 06:43.272
and Hell...

06:43.315 --> 06:45.013
- ...so close behind Devil."
- Shit! Gun! Get out now!

06:52.194 --> 06:54.762
<i>10-22,
this is 10-24. Come in.</i>

06:54.805 --> 06:56.416
<i>Are you engaging the suspects?</i>

06:57.504 --> 07:00.420
<i>Shane, if you're there,
answer me.</i>

07:12.127 --> 07:15.478
They'll make the border
before the state police have a chopper off the ground.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
Yeah, wish I was with them.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.961
Creaky bastard like you

07:20.004 --> 07:22.093
creeping up
on a full-blood Tonkawa.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.966
Spot me.

07:25.009 --> 07:28.448
<i>Mexican police
ain't got a unit close enough to intercede.</i>

07:28.491 --> 07:29.710
<i>These boys should be considered</i>

07:29.753 --> 07:31.886
<i>extremely dangerous
there, partner.</i>

07:31.929 --> 07:33.627
<i>Proceed with caution
now, Tyree.</i>

07:35.759 --> 07:37.848
Hah. You gonna
shoot out their tires?

07:38.719 --> 07:40.155
It's half a mile away, Ranger.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.421
You're a good shot,
but that's impossible.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.780
That's six feet high.
Jesus, Alex.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.623
Goddamn! That's some
shooting there, Ranger.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.626
What happened? What the fuck happened?

08:32.947 --> 08:34.557
Shattered the block
and killed the engine.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.082
Takes a big round to do that.

08:51.313 --> 08:54.272
Save your ammo!
You're not getting a shot at that range.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.578
Are they shootin' at us?

08:59.756 --> 09:02.280
We shot at him,
so he shot back, you dumb fuck.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.547
I'm leaving you, Tom.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.288
You look after the horses,

09:11.333 --> 09:12.639
but know this,

09:12.682 --> 09:15.467
I care more about
that horse than I do you.

09:31.962 --> 09:35.270
I'll fire, you run,
then you cover me as I run.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.358
Let's fucking go.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.345
Agh! Fuck.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.659
Agh, fuck!

10:16.703 --> 10:18.356
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

10:49.039 --> 10:50.127
Alex.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.698
He's a wanted criminal, asshole.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.613
I don't care
if he lives or dies.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.833
Thanks a lot, brother man.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.752
You got me.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.743
Damn! Have I saw
a shooting like that before.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.528
Radio call said there
were four men, Ranger.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.834
You gonna go
after the other guy?

11:45.922 --> 11:49.404
Yeah, that other one
won't get far on his own.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.145
Now you'll be letting me go,
huh, Ranger?

11:52.015 --> 11:53.713
You going to jail, Tom.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.523
I did suggest he knock first.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.831
He was concerned since you
weren't answering your phone.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.661
That man is Special Agent
Derby of the FBI.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.446
British Intelligence.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.493
I take it you're
Ranger Alex Tyree?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.409
Major Edwards said
we could find you here.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.762
We'd like to come in
for a chat, if that's okay.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.250
You all right?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.427
Give me two minutes.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.651
British Intelligence?

13:46.695 --> 13:49.829
We're here with the approval
of your State Department.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.484
Special agent Derby
was tasked with making sure

13:53.528 --> 13:55.269
I didn't get into trouble.

13:55.312 --> 13:58.228
Well, he's lucky I didn't
shoot him through the door.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.840
You have a lot
of enemies, Ranger?

14:03.059 --> 14:05.366
I put people in jail.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.368
They tend to take
offense to that.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.850
I realize you have
a different way

14:10.893 --> 14:12.895
of handling things here, Ranger.

14:12.939 --> 14:16.333
And it can be quite
difficult to grasp from a desk in London, but...

14:17.291 --> 14:20.860
we're very aware of the elite
investigative skills

14:20.903 --> 14:24.124
of the Texas Rangers,
and we know what you do works.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.519
We're not some cowboy
operation, Agent Smith.

14:30.043 --> 14:34.438
We go by the book,
just like they do in London.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.963
I'm here because
Major Edwards said

14:37.006 --> 14:38.486
you're the best ranger
he's ever seen,

14:38.529 --> 14:42.229
so I've been sent to ask you
to go into Mexico

14:42.272 --> 14:43.404
and collect a prisoner.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.625
Federales won't allow
an official British or US extraction,

14:47.669 --> 14:49.932
but unofficially,
they've asked for you.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.282
You'll be there
as a private citizen.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.285
If anything goes wrong,
our association will be basically deniable

14:55.329 --> 14:56.939
in every conceivable way.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.768
It's been nice meeting you,
Agent Smith.

14:59.811 --> 15:00.987
Excuse me?

15:01.030 --> 15:03.467
You got the wrong moron, lady.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.339
Crossed the border myself.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.818
Federales laughed in my face

15:06.862 --> 15:09.082
when I told them I was there
to extradite a prisoner.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.868
I'm late for work.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.783
Carmen here will see you out.

15:14.826 --> 15:17.525
The prisoner in question
is the bank robber

15:17.568 --> 15:20.397
who killed the three deputies
in Esperanza County.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.532
What is he to you?

15:24.575 --> 15:27.013
His name is Declan McBride.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.579
Ex-provisional IRA

15:28.623 --> 15:31.495
wanted for a string
of terrorist activities

15:31.539 --> 15:33.671
on and off the British mainland.

15:33.715 --> 15:37.066
He's extremely vicious
and very resourceful.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.329
And if we don't move quick,

15:39.373 --> 15:42.419
he will find a way
to negotiate himself out prison.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.335
And what's an Irishman
doing robbing banks in Texas?

15:45.379 --> 15:48.512
Well, he's gone rogue,
charging a small fee to rob banks

15:48.556 --> 15:52.125
and passing the proceeds
to the worst criminal causes imaginable.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.910
Through his old partner,

15:54.954 --> 15:58.522
we found out he's planning
a job on the British mainland.

15:59.828 --> 16:03.092
I'm asking you to do this
on behalf of my country.

16:24.418 --> 16:28.378
The English agents
insulted my intelligence

16:28.422 --> 16:30.380
by attempting
to threaten me, Alex.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.862
I was tempted not to give him
an extradition at all,

16:33.905 --> 16:35.559
but then I thought of you.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.735
I remembered you helped me
with a situation

16:37.779 --> 16:40.129
that was very delicate.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.828
That small act
had large consequences.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.874
It made me indebted to you.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.354
Today I pay you back.

16:48.398 --> 16:51.227
The simple extradition
will be now a deportation,

16:51.271 --> 16:54.578
and the paperwork
is already filled out.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.579
Right.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.936
Thanks for the hospitality.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.634
Mexico's a lovely place.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.375
You're welcome.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.665
I can make it
worth your while if you drop me off here.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.058
Save your breath, partner.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.510
I'm sorry
about the police officers.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.338
Genuinely am,

17:58.381 --> 18:00.514
but I acted in the cause
of a greater good.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.995
How much more
of this is off-road?

18:04.039 --> 18:06.346
Less than ten miles,
we'll be at the border cross.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.000
Twenty minutes from there
we'll be in Nuevo Laredo.

18:09.958 --> 18:13.222
You know who led the first
successful revolution against colonial empire?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.094
Huh?

18:15.790 --> 18:17.183
George fucking Washington.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.838
See, justice is just
your perspective, Ranger.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.973
Elements working here are far
bigger than the two of us.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.758
You talk more than my ex-wife.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.369
Shame
of it is, Ranger,

18:30.021 --> 18:31.675
I think I'd have liked
going up against you.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.078
Good to see you again, boss.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.254
No injuries?

19:28.297 --> 19:29.603
Only my pride, brother.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.519
I told you, the bank robbery
was a bad idea.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.217
Next time I'll listen.
Go get that cop.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.096
That's our cue, Oleg.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.229
He's seen your face.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.491
Choose your battles.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.880
Two faces

21:12.923 --> 21:14.838
that warm the heart

21:14.882 --> 21:17.624
with memories of conflict past.

21:17.667 --> 21:22.150
We have walked through
the dark as friends.

21:24.631 --> 21:30.550
Which is better than to walk
through the light alone.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.336
Yuri.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.904
Declan. You will stay.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.122
I have food

21:39.123 --> 21:41.387
and Ukrainian vodka.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.954
My men are peasants
but they raid well.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.348
Come.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.133
We will toast to comrades lost.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.882
It is unwise to refuse
the generosity of Cossack,

21:59.970 --> 22:02.321
lest they change their minds.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.366
Appreciate the invitation.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.325
We're on the job
, brother.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.544
So it is business.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.807
Mm-hmm.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.251
So, gentlemen,

22:21.992 --> 22:26.736
Cold War
155-millimeter-long gun.

22:26.780 --> 22:30.610
It will fire
100-pound projectile

22:30.653 --> 22:32.829
14 miles on good day.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.265
And on a bad day?

22:34.309 --> 22:35.615
On bad day,

22:35.658 --> 22:38.748
it will be the nightmare
that ends your life

22:38.792 --> 22:40.315
before you hear the sound.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.318
Have your men deliver
to this address.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.581
I'll take it from there.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.675
You know,

22:55.417 --> 23:00.379
I worry that you will upset
many people with this toy.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.686
I like you, Declan.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.427
You are like brother.

23:06.167 --> 23:11.172
But when this job is over,
then so are we.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.139
I expected you to look worse.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.364
You got a lot of nerve, lady.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.235
You've every right
to be indignant.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.194
You were ambushed,
likely set up,

23:33.237 --> 23:37.503
but you did your job, and
thank God you're still alive.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.766
Thank God I'm alive.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.421
Ranger Daniels was a good man.

23:42.986 --> 23:45.902
He was a husband, father,

23:47.034 --> 23:49.340
and a damn fine lawman.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.039
He was also my friend.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.346
I'm sorry.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.435
Sorry?

23:58.393 --> 24:00.134
That ain't gonna cut it.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.528
But work with me, Tyree.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.225
Help me bring in McBride.

24:04.268 --> 24:07.054
You've seen him close-up,
talked to him.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.969
You know him better than
anyone else we have.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.536
I doubt that.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.886
You knew they were gonna try
to spring him, didn't you?

24:14.583 --> 24:18.152
Need to get yourself
another errand boy, lady.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.415
If I go after McBride,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.983
it's gonna be under my terms,

24:23.026 --> 24:25.725
with my men, and my rules.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.031
Just sit down, please.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.817
Ranger Tyree, please.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.907
You got one good reason
why I should help you?

24:33.950 --> 24:37.171
You want a reason,
I'll give you multiple reasons.

24:37.214 --> 24:40.914
The 1993 killings
of US servicemen in Somalia.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.351
The '98 bombings
of US embassies.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.701
The kidnapping of 16
Western tourists in Yemen

24:45.745 --> 24:47.486
- that same year.
- Yemen?

24:47.529 --> 24:52.142
All executed and planned
by a man named Aden Kashmiri.

24:52.708 --> 24:56.538
Now, we believe Kashmiri
has retained McBride's services

24:56.582 --> 24:58.279
for a substantial fee

24:58.322 --> 25:01.630
to cause or instigate
a terrorist event in London.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.808
McBride working for Kashmiri

25:05.852 --> 25:08.768
makes him the world's most
dangerous terrorist for hire.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.683
Keep talking.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.946
Help me track him down.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.600
Do what you do.

25:19.692 --> 25:22.390
Uh, the department
would have to sign off on it,

25:22.433 --> 25:26.437
and nothing really gels
around here that efficiently,

25:26.481 --> 25:27.438
so...

25:32.095 --> 25:34.489
You've already talked
to the major, haven't ya?

25:39.450 --> 25:40.582
Right.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.770
You remind me of my dad.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.427
He was a police detective
in London.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.168
We're in the East End.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.778
It used to be a rough area.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.652
He was killed on the job
when I was 17.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.220
Mm.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.613
Sorry to hear that.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.095
It was then and there I decided
to go into law enforcement.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.313
Ah.

26:16.357 --> 26:19.186
Switched college courses
to criminal science,

26:19.229 --> 26:21.971
was recruited straight
out of college by MI6.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.278
You did all right.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.237
He'd approve.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.718
Don't underestimate
McBride, Ranger.

26:30.676 --> 26:35.115
Declan is a sociopathic
murderer with a genius IQ.

26:35.158 --> 26:38.292
Misjudged him once.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.598
Won't happen again.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.382
I believe that.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.213
I should ask.

26:46.256 --> 26:49.956
Do you plan on even
remotely trying to blend in?

26:56.702 --> 26:59.139
I guess I could lose
the hat in London.

27:22.075 --> 27:25.644
Section Control Geddes.
Call me Chief Control

27:25.687 --> 27:28.298
or just Geddes.
We're informal here.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.432
- Who's "we"?
- The agency.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.652
We who ensure the security

27:33.695 --> 27:37.873
of the entire island nation
of Great Britain and it's Commonwealth.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.658
Glad you can join us.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.704
Alex Tyree.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.793
Nice hat, very subtle.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.361
I'll order you one.

27:47.404 --> 27:50.712
If you had to give a threat
assessment number out of ten,

27:50.756 --> 27:53.672
in your opinion, where
would Declan McBride sit?

27:53.715 --> 27:56.675
I don't rate 'em.
Just catch 'em and brand 'em.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.068
Mm. You actually talk like that.

28:00.461 --> 28:03.290
This asshole got away
from me once.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.422
I'll drop the boom
on him next time.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.991
You've been closer to him
than any living operative,

28:09.035 --> 28:11.080
you've spoken to him
and survived.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.996
That makes you
a temporary asset, Ranger.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.870
McBride is in London,
and it's our responsibility

28:17.913 --> 28:20.742
to see to it
that he doesn't leave.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.309
Is that clear?

28:22.352 --> 28:24.746
Yeah, I get your drift, chief.

28:24.790 --> 28:30.143
If you do something,
anything that reflects poorly on the agency,

28:30.186 --> 28:32.449
asset status terminated.

28:32.493 --> 28:33.799
You're on your own, son.

28:33.842 --> 28:37.106
Am I crystal fucking clear?

28:37.150 --> 28:38.542
I'm not your son.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.109
And I'm not your fucking daddy.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.416
Just answer
the question, cowboy.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.200
We understand, Control.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.028
Thank you for accommodating us.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.291
And we will do everything
in our power

28:48.335 --> 28:50.293
to respect the agency's wishes

28:50.337 --> 28:52.774
and the discreet nature
of our position.

28:52.818 --> 28:56.256
There'll be a detective
in the lobby, 7:30 a.m.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.823
He's your liaison.

28:57.866 --> 29:01.435
You are not permitted to move
around the city without him.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.786
That five-peso star
affords you no more rights

29:04.830 --> 29:07.702
than any other guest
to this city.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.574
Agent Smith,
you're in the UK now.

29:11.619 --> 29:14.100
Protocol is everything.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.405
Yes, Control.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.889
Okay. Seven and three-eighths.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.458
My hat size.

29:36.035 --> 29:39.038
Yeah?
Who said you could stop?

29:41.997 --> 29:43.956
You owe me more than that,
you lazy cunt.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.611
Always a sweet talker.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.798
You shouldn't have left me.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.844
You got what
shouldn't be gotten.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.460
I need your help, Angel.

30:15.639 --> 30:16.684
I know.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.775
Knew it when I saw you.
Knew it when you made love.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.605
Know it's the only reason
you're here now.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.530
Angel...

30:46.627 --> 30:48.411
Angel...

30:48.455 --> 30:50.022
Kid outside worships me.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.634
I give him kale and he'll
slice you into dozen pieces

30:53.677 --> 30:55.244
and throw you in the Thames.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.031
Shouldn't have done
what you did to me.

31:00.380 --> 31:03.209
Swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd fuck you back.

31:09.650 --> 31:10.869
So this is it?

31:13.741 --> 31:16.309
You turned on too many
old friends, me included.

31:20.443 --> 31:21.880
Now you can leave.

31:34.109 --> 31:37.939
Alex Tyree,
you're in room 207. Elevator's to the left.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.463
- Thank you.
- Wanna walk off the cab ride?

31:40.507 --> 31:43.510
As opposed to a massage?

31:43.553 --> 31:45.207
Luke will take
any luggage for you.

31:48.558 --> 31:49.690
Thank you, Luke.

31:49.733 --> 31:50.865
With pleasure, sir.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.345
Throw it on the bed.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.352
You call this April?

31:59.395 --> 32:02.050
Should've listened to Carmen
and wore a warmer jacket.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.574
So you staying at the hotel?

32:05.532 --> 32:07.229
Well, I lived in Langley
for three years.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.405
I don't keep a place
in the UK anymore.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.755
Stranger in your own town, huh?

32:14.019 --> 32:16.064
Geddes wants us to work
with his babysitter

32:16.108 --> 32:17.936
but they won't be here
till morning.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.940
This ain't a walk
for our health, is it?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.116
It's a long shot.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.248
There's a potential
intelligence source.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.207
- Taxi.
- Ah.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.560
Her name's Angel, ex-IRA,

32:33.603 --> 32:36.215
and she's got a real axe
to grind when it comes to McBride.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.565
Let's hope
she feels like talking.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.920
Nice company
you keep, Smith.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.141
People looking to stay
in our good grace, you know how it is.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.969
No, I don't. Not really.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.667
I'm many things to many people,

33:37.711 --> 33:40.670
and today,
I get to call in a favor.

33:42.803 --> 33:43.891
Mm-hmm.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.298
Long time, no see,
you British cunt.

33:59.341 --> 34:02.736
How are you anyway,
filthy Irish trollop.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.433
I was all right
until yous arrived

34:04.477 --> 34:06.914
stinking up my drinking space.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.437
Can I join you for a drink?

34:09.264 --> 34:11.919
Or is looking at your reflection
caused you to, you know,

34:11.962 --> 34:13.225
empty the bar already?

34:14.922 --> 34:16.489
You brought
your girlfriend here.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.361
Part of the States
you're from, yeah?

34:19.405 --> 34:20.667
Texas, ma'am.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.104
Great state of Texas.

34:23.148 --> 34:26.629
Well, you may want to invest
in some local wardrobe.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.718
You stand out like
a baller in sweatpants.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.026
I know what yous want, Smith.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.681
Hmm. Bad news travels fast.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.553
Get outta here.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.294
Give us some privacy,
you fucking apes.

34:39.338 --> 34:42.558
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.669
Don't screw me around, Angel.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.107
You know me better than that.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.503
Sit down. Sit down.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.811
He's here in town, for sure.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.901
You're not gonna find him
without my help.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.559
Why should I believe anything
you have to say about him?

35:26.602 --> 35:28.648
You're hardly
a disinterested party.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.040
I know what you're implying,

35:30.084 --> 35:31.999
but anything between
McBride and me died

35:32.042 --> 35:33.696
when he took my fucking eye.

35:33.740 --> 35:37.700
Hmm. 'Cause I heard he saved
your life after the attack

35:37.744 --> 35:38.832
where you lost your eye.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.226
You heard fucking wrong.

35:41.269 --> 35:45.273
You expect me to believe
that any animosity you have for McBride

35:45.317 --> 35:48.189
is motivation enough
to sully your reputation?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.020
- I want money.
- Ah.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.326
Cash money.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.197
Man's fucking dangerous.

35:56.241 --> 36:00.027
So in addition, I'll be wanting
three men released.

36:00.810 --> 36:03.248
Not parole, but released.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.164
These lads need a clean record
to get their year citizenship.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.167
So much harder since 9/11.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.607
You can appreciate that,
don't you, Ranger?

36:16.609 --> 36:17.871
You don't have anything.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.222
I can negotiate
a visa entry.

36:23.920 --> 36:28.925
And arrange for leniency,
customs and immigrations

36:28.969 --> 36:31.189
in extenuating
circumstances, you see.

36:32.625 --> 36:33.974
You have my word on it.

36:37.891 --> 36:41.024
<i>You'll find McBride
when you find Oleg.</i>

36:41.851 --> 36:45.159
<i>Checked in two days ago.
Room 27.</i>

36:45.203 --> 36:46.204
Right.

36:50.817 --> 36:51.905
Jesus.

36:57.606 --> 37:01.044
You sure take me
to the nicest places, Smith.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.785
Just make sure
you stay behind me.

37:02.829 --> 37:03.873
Ahh.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.270
McBride finds out I'm in town,

37:09.314 --> 37:13.970
he'll go Casper on us,
which gives us hours not days.

37:14.014 --> 37:17.496
And time is of the essence.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.326
What is that?

37:23.415 --> 37:26.156
They told me to leave
my .45 at home.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.811
You are just an observer
here, Tyree.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.465
Study shows it's a lot
more dangerous

37:30.509 --> 37:32.598
when law enforcement are armed.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.600
Weren't dangerous,
wouldn't need one.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.740
You think your sweet talking
Irish friend set us up?

37:45.437 --> 37:47.830
That's always a possibility.
Check that way.

38:24.476 --> 38:25.912
What a rat's nest.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.222
Football.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.386
This is CSI Smith.
We need backup.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.345
223 Green Street, Hackney.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.303
We have one armed suspect.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.522
Automatic weapon.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.785
He has a gun.
We are receiving fire.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.145
You should have killed me
when you had the chance, you motherfucker.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.557
Stop! Stop! You fucking freeze.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.647
Don't you fucking dare. Agh!

39:51.737 --> 39:53.956
Fuck! You okay?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.349
Go. Go.

40:03.183 --> 40:04.837
Hold it! Freeze!

40:12.714 --> 40:14.803
- You all right, mate?
- Tyree, cease fire! Civilian!

40:21.157 --> 40:22.811
Police! Drop your gun! Now!

40:22.855 --> 40:24.900
No! This is MCA
official business.

40:24.944 --> 40:27.816
We're on active assignment.
Check my ID. Check it.

40:40.829 --> 40:44.137
Technical branch
performed a digital forensic

40:44.180 --> 40:46.748
on the cell phone
you acquired, Smith.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.403
Belongs to Oleg Jakovenko,

40:49.447 --> 40:54.452
McBride's second in command,
a worthy target of opportunity.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.889
Tragic that you
let him slip away.

40:58.499 --> 41:02.372
If Jakovenko is in London,
then McBride's nearby.

41:02.416 --> 41:05.419
Give me access to the data,
let me find him, Control.

41:07.073 --> 41:11.338
An arresting officer
has already gone on record

41:11.381 --> 41:14.994
saying that someone
in a cowboy hat

41:15.037 --> 41:20.521
fired shots at a fleeing suspect
in a crowded area.

41:20.565 --> 41:25.657
Even allowing for certain
quaint West Texas customs,

41:26.484 --> 41:29.530
uh, wouldn't you agree that
that was quite reckless?

41:31.271 --> 41:33.360
Last time I saw him,

41:33.403 --> 41:36.276
he murdered my friend
and partner, chief.

41:39.192 --> 41:41.455
You don't forget a man
does that to you.

41:44.850 --> 41:48.897
Give me something that I can
take to the agency executive.

41:48.941 --> 41:52.118
Parliamentary council
is breathing down their necks.

41:52.161 --> 41:56.601
Nobody enjoys parrying
questions from Etonians

41:56.644 --> 41:59.647
with no concept
of field intelligence.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.956
They're actually already talking
about a possible scapegoat.

42:05.392 --> 42:07.699
Any reason I shouldn't
give them one?

42:07.742 --> 42:09.309
Ranger Tyree is the only asset

42:09.352 --> 42:11.833
that's seen Declan McBride
in person.

42:11.877 --> 42:14.096
We're British Intelligence.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.577
We have considerable
assets, don't we?

42:16.621 --> 42:17.970
Use them.

42:18.013 --> 42:20.973
Convince me that
you are the right team

42:21.016 --> 42:22.452
for this assignment.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.759
I need concrete evidence

42:24.803 --> 42:27.545
that McBride is operating
on British soil.

42:27.588 --> 42:29.808
<i>Ad colligenda bona.</i>

42:31.461 --> 42:32.550
Thanks, boss.

42:33.986 --> 42:38.120
And I will also need
a written report, Ranger Tyree,

42:38.164 --> 42:40.122
about yesterday's action.

42:43.735 --> 42:46.172
I wasn't sure what
I thought of you, chief.

42:46.215 --> 42:49.567
I'm just a simple
operative like you.

42:50.872 --> 42:52.439
Perhaps.

42:52.482 --> 42:56.312
I'm sure we're gonna get
along very, very well, Ranger.

42:56.356 --> 42:57.575
Mm-hmm.

43:36.439 --> 43:37.658
Count it.

43:37.702 --> 43:38.790
I trust you.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.400
Don't ever trust a terrorist.

43:40.443 --> 43:43.316
It's just... I need
the moneys, desperately.

43:43.359 --> 43:46.449
Mm. All men are desperate
one way or another.

43:47.842 --> 43:50.758
During the Troubles,
the British SAS,

43:50.802 --> 43:52.499
they had a Nemesis program

43:52.542 --> 43:55.502
where they take Republican
prisoners into the woods

43:56.155 --> 43:57.243
and disappear them,

43:58.592 --> 43:59.854
never to be seen again.

44:01.421 --> 44:04.598
I'm gonna give more to your
family than the British gave us.

44:37.239 --> 44:38.676
Join me for a drink, Ranger?

44:40.373 --> 44:42.375
My stomach's saying breakfast,

44:43.463 --> 44:44.856
but a drink will do.

44:54.387 --> 44:56.781
You got family in the UK?

44:58.565 --> 45:00.175
Scattered to the four winds.

45:03.526 --> 45:05.659
Mr. Smith, is he American?

45:07.443 --> 45:10.446
Oh. Mr. Smith was my father.

45:11.447 --> 45:15.234
Spend a lot of time in hotels,
so wedding ring's a deterrent.

45:15.277 --> 45:17.410
- Ah.
- I don't like small talk.

45:18.541 --> 45:22.720
Yeah. Tough to have a laugh
doing what we do.

45:25.940 --> 45:28.421
My ex-wife always wanted kids.

45:29.683 --> 45:32.860
I was never home long enough
to seal the deal.

45:34.644 --> 45:36.385
By the time I was ready,

45:37.691 --> 45:39.084
she'd already left me.

45:40.215 --> 45:42.914
Yeah, I wouldn't have
a relationship in this line of work.

45:42.957 --> 45:43.915
Mm.

45:45.351 --> 45:49.529
My father left a unfixable
void when he died.

45:50.573 --> 45:51.618
It's not fair.

45:54.577 --> 45:58.320
What would your next step be
if we were in Texas?

45:58.364 --> 45:59.408
Hunt him

46:00.366 --> 46:01.497
relentlessly.

46:03.412 --> 46:05.937
I convinced technical branch

46:05.980 --> 46:09.549
to share the data transcript
from Oleg's phone.

46:11.377 --> 46:13.118
We were able to trace a number.

46:14.554 --> 46:17.165
Initiative, Smith. I like it.

46:18.471 --> 46:19.907
Here's to that.

46:29.917 --> 46:31.919
Thank you
for your hospitality.

47:16.442 --> 47:18.270
They'll have
more reinforcements. We have to move!

47:20.925 --> 47:22.883
Get to the street
and don't look back. Go.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.048
Come on, let's have you.

47:57.091 --> 47:58.310
The woman shot me.

47:58.353 --> 47:59.485
Get the fuck in.

48:11.845 --> 48:16.415
It's gonna sting.

48:16.458 --> 48:18.112
- All right.
- Ugh.

48:18.156 --> 48:19.809
- You're tough.
- Mm.

48:20.723 --> 48:23.422
- There we go.
- They targeted us.

48:24.075 --> 48:25.772
That means we've got
their attention.

48:25.815 --> 48:28.296
Well, if he's smart,

48:28.340 --> 48:32.257
he'll cancel whatever plans
he has and break camp.

48:32.300 --> 48:33.562
Then we've lost him.

48:35.129 --> 48:37.827
You need to rest this arm.

48:37.871 --> 48:39.568
Your system's going into shock.

48:41.962 --> 48:45.923
You'll get sleepy,
but that's okay. I'll be here.

48:49.056 --> 48:50.579
All right, little press.

48:50.623 --> 48:52.886
Ah.

48:55.845 --> 48:56.890
Hm.

49:00.328 --> 49:01.939
You did good today.

49:03.723 --> 49:06.813
Went against him
when he had you dead to rights.

49:08.293 --> 49:10.948
Yeah, you saved my life.

49:12.384 --> 49:16.127
Gave, uh, them folks
a reason to run.

49:16.170 --> 49:20.087
Probably got yourself into
a lot of trouble with Control.

49:20.131 --> 49:22.089
That takes guts.

49:22.133 --> 49:24.222
With that little pistol too.

49:24.265 --> 49:26.311
Don't knock my little pistol.

49:26.354 --> 49:28.661
I'm gonna dig us up some grub,

49:28.704 --> 49:31.446
Shock wears off, it leaves
a hell of an appetite.

49:32.447 --> 49:34.319
Thank you, Ranger.

49:35.711 --> 49:36.756
Alex.

49:37.626 --> 49:39.411
Thank you, Alex.

49:39.454 --> 49:40.847
Don't want you coming after me

49:40.890 --> 49:42.675
with that little
pistol of yours.

49:51.292 --> 49:52.772
Ah. There you go.

49:57.603 --> 49:59.692
Here. Drink will make you
feel better.

50:01.737 --> 50:03.565
Here you go.

50:03.609 --> 50:05.654
Reggie, bring that down
to the man.

50:05.698 --> 50:07.308
Good boy.

50:19.625 --> 50:22.280
I have fond memories
of our time together, Declan,

50:22.323 --> 50:24.282
but I can't say I'm happy
about seeing you

50:24.325 --> 50:25.805
under these circumstances.

50:25.848 --> 50:27.067
We need to talk.

50:29.504 --> 50:30.636
In front of the boy?

50:30.679 --> 50:32.551
Ah, don't worry about him.

50:32.594 --> 50:35.249
Our special, sweet-minded boy.

50:35.293 --> 50:37.077
God chose to touch his mind.

50:39.123 --> 50:40.863
Declan...

50:40.907 --> 50:43.736
what you do now,
you do for the love of chaos.

50:44.345 --> 50:45.738
It's not what you were.

50:45.781 --> 50:47.740
We were part of something
bigger than us.

50:47.783 --> 50:51.918
There's a certain grace
in crusading for lost causes.

50:51.961 --> 50:53.876
I'm finished
with lost causes, doc.

50:56.401 --> 50:59.273
Reggie, give us
a song, will you?

50:59.317 --> 51:01.797
"The Foggy Dew." Good lad.

51:01.841 --> 51:03.669
I thought you said
he didn't talk.

51:03.712 --> 51:07.586
He doesn't talk,
but he does sing.

51:07.629 --> 51:13.548
<i>♪ As down the glen
one Easter morn ♪</i>

51:13.592 --> 51:18.249
<i>♪ To a city fair rode I</i>

51:19.076 --> 51:24.472
<i>♪ There armed lines
of marching men ♪</i>

51:24.516 --> 51:29.738
<i>♪ In squadrons passed me by</i>

51:30.522 --> 51:33.351
<i>♪ No pipe did hum</i>

51:33.394 --> 51:36.180
<i>♪ No battle drum</i>

51:36.223 --> 51:41.228

51:41.272 --> 51:47.104

51:47.147 --> 51:52.065
<i>- ♪ Rang out in the foggy dew</i>

51:52.109 --> 51:55.286
Good lad, good lad. Well done.

51:58.811 --> 52:00.247
Angel's been talking.

52:01.596 --> 52:05.383
Three of our men,
prisoners in Belmarsh Prison

52:05.426 --> 52:08.081
had their sentences exonerated.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.430
Word on the street...

52:11.084 --> 52:13.042
diplomatic pressure from above.

52:13.695 --> 52:15.349
If you got something to say,

52:16.220 --> 52:17.569
then you spit it out.

52:18.613 --> 52:20.180
You're on your own now, Declan,

52:20.224 --> 52:23.357
everyone is turning
against you, even her.

52:24.358 --> 52:25.490
Even your angel.

52:25.533 --> 52:26.839
You don't know anything.

52:26.882 --> 52:28.710
What I did for your friend
over there

52:28.754 --> 52:30.669
is my repayment
to the debt I owe you.

52:32.671 --> 52:34.151
When you leave here tonight,

52:36.849 --> 52:38.111
don't ever come back.

52:54.867 --> 52:55.911
Bingo.

53:02.962 --> 53:04.137
Oh.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.921
I found us some food,

53:05.965 --> 53:07.532
if you can call it that.

53:07.575 --> 53:08.620
Listen.

53:09.664 --> 53:12.014
I had a friend
dig a little deeper

53:12.058 --> 53:14.234
- on Oleg Jakovenko.
- Oh, yeah?

53:14.278 --> 53:16.889
Sentenced to 40 years
hard labor

53:16.932 --> 53:20.240
in Lukianivska Prison
for war crimes.

53:20.284 --> 53:21.981
Here, you should eat something.

53:22.024 --> 53:23.287
I don't eat pork.

53:23.330 --> 53:25.637
He escaped with McBride
and two other prisoners,

53:25.680 --> 53:27.378
and during the escape,

53:27.421 --> 53:29.945
Oleg killed the two guards
who were watching McBride.

53:31.338 --> 53:34.167
Yeah, sounds like
a real charmer.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.560
Oh, yeah.

53:35.603 --> 53:39.390
Interpol alert for Northern
Ireland, Libya, Iran,

53:39.433 --> 53:41.696
Chechnya, Bosnia, Rwanda.

53:41.740 --> 53:45.222
I mean, the list reads like
a soldier of fortune world tour.

53:46.048 --> 53:48.355
Look, McBride's
planning something.

53:48.399 --> 53:50.531
But why did he break cover
to kill you?

53:51.532 --> 53:53.230
Well, he ain't special.

53:54.231 --> 53:57.103
I bring him in,
head down over the saddle,

53:57.146 --> 53:59.497
just like any other horse thief.

54:00.628 --> 54:02.630
I forget that's how
you actually speak.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.982
I had an instructor
used to tell us,

54:07.026 --> 54:09.420
there's two types in this game.

54:10.421 --> 54:13.685
Those on the run,
and those doing the hunting.

54:15.077 --> 54:18.080
And, man, McBride's a man
on the run, that's all.

54:18.124 --> 54:19.560
Hmm.

54:19.604 --> 54:23.695
The address on the Ukrainian
cell phone could be nothing.

54:25.653 --> 54:26.698
Wanna go look?

54:32.878 --> 54:35.794
What could possibly
go wrong?

54:48.763 --> 54:51.462
I'm thinking maybe
this is McBride's safe house.

54:52.463 --> 54:53.899
We bust enough of 'em,

54:53.942 --> 54:56.989
think it'll get us back
in good graces with Control?

55:08.479 --> 55:11.569
Get off the phone.
Get off the fucking phone.

55:11.612 --> 55:12.918
- And who the fuck are you?
- Ah.

55:14.006 --> 55:15.834
- Get off the phone.
- What the fuck are you doing?

55:15.877 --> 55:18.271
- Get up.
- What are you-- Ow!

55:18.315 --> 55:21.361
Anya, who did you call?

55:21.405 --> 55:23.363
Fucking Tooth Fairy.
Who do you think?

55:23.407 --> 55:26.323
- He's upstairs.
- How did you know?

55:26.366 --> 55:29.978
Well, he's written
"Russian gangster, Room 212" right here.

55:30.022 --> 55:32.981
- Seriously?
- I did not fucking write that.

55:33.025 --> 55:34.809
Sit the fuck down.
Don't fucking move.

55:34.853 --> 55:35.941
Fucking hell.

55:40.293 --> 55:41.381
Yes, ma'am.

55:42.948 --> 55:44.689
Getting that déjà vu feeling.

55:44.732 --> 55:46.386
You wanna call for backup?

55:46.430 --> 55:47.692
Please.

55:47.735 --> 55:49.258
Don't touch any firearms.

56:03.664 --> 56:05.579
Did he really write
"Russian gangster"?

56:05.623 --> 56:08.147
No. I just wanted
to see his reaction.

56:09.714 --> 56:12.543
This is the only occupied room.

56:15.415 --> 56:17.461
Freedom fighting is many things,

56:18.462 --> 56:20.072
but glamorous it isn't.

56:33.215 --> 56:36.393
Irishman's tied
a tin can to our tail.

56:38.177 --> 56:40.832
Fuck. Fire escape?

56:40.875 --> 56:42.964
Nah, he'd have thought of that.

56:43.008 --> 56:44.052
So?

56:45.097 --> 56:46.577
We got the advantage.

56:47.447 --> 56:48.448
How's that?

56:52.147 --> 56:54.062
He thinks he got the drop on us.

56:54.106 --> 56:55.455
On my mother's,
I catched him.

56:55.499 --> 56:57.544
I won't tell him a word.
I promise.

56:57.588 --> 56:58.937
Please, they came
bowling in here.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.460
I didn't even get
a fucking chance to speak.

57:00.504 --> 57:02.027
They took my phone
off me and all.

57:02.070 --> 57:05.291
Oh, God!

58:04.568 --> 58:06.091
Have you stopped
shooting my men?

58:08.093 --> 58:10.182
Becoming very difficult
to find gunmen.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.881
But after these ones,
what am I gonna do?

58:13.925 --> 58:15.753
Put your fucking hands up!

58:23.761 --> 58:26.328
I knew you weren't dead
when I left you in desert.

58:27.591 --> 58:29.854
I told him it was a mistake
not to finish you.

58:31.159 --> 58:33.684
Will you
pass me a napkin, Ranger?

58:36.382 --> 58:37.557
Something in my eye.

58:53.007 --> 58:55.357
Why are you
with this outfit, Oleg?

58:56.881 --> 59:00.537
Discretion is like
the calcium in my bones, Ranger.

59:05.846 --> 59:07.848
You could help me
bring him in.

59:10.808 --> 59:13.767
When you're in Texas, we say,

59:14.899 --> 59:17.945
first to talk
is the first to walk.

59:18.685 --> 59:22.080
He's waited a long time
to see this city burn.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:56.887
- Stop!
- Government agent.

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.585
I got a government agent here.

01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:01.195
You do fine, easy fellas.

01:02:02.457 --> 01:02:04.155
One suspect.

01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:06.766
I have an injured suspect
wearing an IED explosive vest.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.289
We need a bomb squad here now!

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.682
Go get 'em, fellas.

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.097
An embarrassing result.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.751
Ah, we look good together.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.624
Uh, perhaps not
the kind of image

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:41.932
the agency is hoping to purvey.

01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:45.544
Can either of you give me
a reason why I don't punish you

01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:48.068
to the full extent
of my authority?

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:52.246
We except full responsibility
for the indiscretion, Control.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.162
An explanation will be outlined
in detail in my report.

01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:56.250
Mm-hmm.

01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:00.777
You've had a promising
career up to now, Agent Smith.

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:06.217
Expert in diplomatic
protocol and procedure.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.048
Frankly, I am shocked
by your reckless behavior.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.485
Having said that,

01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:17.358
evidence we recovered led us
to a nuclear scientist

01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:19.926
with a painkiller addiction.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.322
It seems that he sold a quantity

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:29.283
of high isotope
uranium 235 to McBride.

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:31.068
He's making a dirty bomb?

01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:34.375
We're putting every agent
in the field.

01:03:34.419 --> 01:03:38.597
Intel says McBride will be
ready to strike next week.

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:40.686
We need to get to work then.

01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:45.517
Eleven EOD has one
of your shooters in isolation.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.086
He was wearing a suicide vest
that failed to detonate.

01:03:49.129 --> 01:03:51.436
Fortune favors the bold.

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:54.961
Drop a logistics waiver
and get over there.

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:57.094
Quickish.

01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:07.017
Information on the
prisoner's family.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.714
Tell me
about the ordinance.

01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:10.324
Layered PD4 derivative,

01:04:10.368 --> 01:04:12.370
detonator enveloped
inside the accelerant.

01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:14.720
High pressure water cutter?

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:19.029
There's an RDX crystal
compound on the detonator,

01:04:19.072 --> 01:04:21.118
safeguards against tampering.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:23.816
I haven't seen anything this
advanced since the EOD school.

01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:28.603
Open the security door.

01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:31.563
I wish to talk to the prisoner.

01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:39.614
This guy hear us
through this thing?

01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:41.181
I can turn on two-way
for you, sir.

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:48.710
McBride talked you
into blowing yourself up.

01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:50.669
What's your family
think about that?

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:53.498
"Every soul shall
have a taste of death."

01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:55.892
"But only on the day
of judgment

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:57.894
shall you be paid in full."

01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:00.766
You know the words?

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:01.854
I do.

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:05.336
They are just
words to you.

01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:08.469
Gor. Gor.

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:11.298
How do we find Declan McBride?

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.213
You have your mission.

01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:16.869
Mine is to protect my family.

01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:21.178
Full diplomatic protection.

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:24.398
They'll be in a secure location
by tomorrow morning.

01:05:24.442 --> 01:05:25.573
You have my word.

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:31.492
He's gonna do it.

01:05:32.841 --> 01:05:33.973
I love them.

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.063
He has left.

01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:39.805
What?

01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:42.112
He spoke about finding
a glass skylight,

01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:45.985
a window from a tall building.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:48.466
When? Where?

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.207
Overlooking the river.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.166
The ancient clock.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:56.039
Where you don't buy hope.

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.171
Come what may.

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.567
Today is not the end of history.

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.005
No...

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.746
Oh, boy.

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:09.704
RDX relay has been engaged.

01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:13.360
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get out of there, Smith.</i>

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:14.535
Gor...

01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:16.450
Show them where
to find my family.

01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:17.712
Gor, can you disarm it?

01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:20.759
Gor, can you disarm it?

01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:23.980
Disarm it! Gor!

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.767
- Smith, get outta there.
- Gor!

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.161
<i>The agent needs
to exit the bomb bay now.</i>

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.872
What a waste.

01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:48.743
Not to his way of thinking.

01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:51.050
Delusions of grandeur.

01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:53.009
Hebephrenic schizophrenia.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:56.969
In Texas, we'd say not enough
cotton balls on a bush

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.319
to haul a full trailer
to the gin...

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:00.973
if you know
what I'm saying.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.716
Eh, he thinks
he's one of his heroes.

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:07.762
Michael Collins.
George Washington.

01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:10.765
Struggling against the British.
Wants fame.

01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:14.334
Mm, it's not much use
if you're dead or in prison.

01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:16.684
Mm, thought process
don't work like that.

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:21.994
McKinley's assassin bought
a pearl-handled revolver

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:26.694
so it would look nice
in a museum next to his photo.

01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:29.175
It's not next week.

01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:31.743
It's in two days.

01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:33.310
April 24th.

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.529
The Easter Monday uprising
against the British,

01:07:35.573 --> 01:07:38.315
April 24th, 1916.

01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:41.840
Ancient clock. Big Ben
near Houses of Parliament.

01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:43.668
He's gonna launch a dirty bomb.

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:44.799
Not bad.

01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:49.761
But you got there 'cause
of my comment about Michael Collins, didn't you?

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:51.632
Really?

01:07:58.248 --> 01:08:02.861
In 1954, French forces
suffered a defeat so definitive

01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:05.298
that they withdrew
all colonial forces

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.126
and quit the conflict
in Indochina.

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:09.868
To surprise the French,

01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.653
Viet men had attacked
from mountains overlooking the French positions,

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:15.917
dismantling their artillery
and carried on bicycles

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:18.137
on women's backs
up into the mountain.

01:08:18.181 --> 01:08:20.226
In front of me, Mr. Kashmiri,

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.099
is a 152-millimeter Howitzer

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.797
smuggled into the country
piece by piece.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.146
Reassembled

01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:29.366
and aimed directly
at the House of Parliament.

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:33.326
<i>You have performed your task
remarkably, Brother McBride.</i>

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:37.330
<i>Now I must ask you
to step away.</i>

01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:38.462
Step away?

01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:42.161
This is the single greatest
terrorist plot since 9/11

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.510
and you're asking me
to stand down

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:44.946
before the command performance?

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.514
<i>The threat is greater
than the act.</i>

01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:50.300
<i>Until it is proved that
we can do what we promise,</i>

01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:53.999
<i>we can negotiate our demands.</i>

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:55.174
Demands?

01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:58.873
You're just another
fucking politician.

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:01.006
<i>I am Aden Kashmiri!</i>

01:09:01.049 --> 01:09:02.573
<i>Your spiritual leader!</i>

01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:06.925
<i>You will do as I command
and stand down, McBride.</i>

01:09:06.968 --> 01:09:08.361
<i>Stand down!</i>

01:09:08.405 --> 01:09:11.538
<i>The blood of the prophet
runs in me. Don't do it!</i>

01:09:37.347 --> 01:09:38.739
I thought you'd quit.

01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:43.657
Killed Protestants in the name
of the Catholic faith.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.357
Buddhists in the name of China.

01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.881
Hindus in the name of Buddha.

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.491
I killed Christians
in the name of Islam,

01:09:51.535 --> 01:09:52.971
and now they ask me to stop.

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:02.285
Bloody religions.
To hell, them all.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.295
I'll drink to that.

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:18.431
The ranger will be coming.

01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:29.442
Time to finish old business.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:31.052
Let's go.

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.026
Chopper unit with FLIR

01:10:48.069 --> 01:10:50.376
discovered an off-the-charts
radium deposit.

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.988
Requires at least
50 pounds of isotope

01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:55.381
to give off a reading
that intense.

01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:56.556
Thanks, sir.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.602
I served in Kyrgyzstan
and Syria, Ranger.

01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.909
You don't see it.
You don't smell it.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:03.215
You don't hear it.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.173
It kills absolutely
and without warning.

01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:06.827
I am not sending
my men in there.

01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:08.742
- But I need to go in.
- Well, you can do as you wish,

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:10.527
but you're gonna have to wait
until the area's evacuated.

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.658
Evacuated?

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:13.486
I ordered a two-mile
radius evacuated,

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:16.489
and when it is,
I'm hitting that building with a JDAM explosive missile.

01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:19.187
I need time.
We need this guy alive.

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.886
He's our only link
to Aden Kashmiri.

01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:25.455
A JDAM missile
will take out the entire block.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:26.978
Give me two rocket launchers

01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:28.675
on the building
across the street,

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:30.024
and wait for my order.

01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:34.638
<i>I can give you 30 minutes, Smith,</i>

01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.857
<i>and then we're hitting
the building whether you're out or not.</i>

01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:37.945
<i>Am I clear?</i>

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.908
We need to be careful.

01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:46.040
We don't want McBride
triggering this thing.

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:49.305
We'll catch him
like a rabbit.

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:51.829
Cage will be on him
before he knows what hit him.

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.209
I'll take care of this guy.

01:12:25.602 --> 01:12:27.821
I'll go upstairs,
I'll wait for you.

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.715
Security building's
been breached.

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.983
By a tall piece of piss
wearing a ten-gallon hat.

01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.074
Oleg will take care of it.

01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:06.947
Move out.

01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:13.954
Ranger.

01:13:17.741 --> 01:13:18.959
We're getting old,

01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:23.007
and the men we break in
are just getting younger.

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.227
I drink vodka in the morning
to ease the pain of a long life.

01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:32.669
<i>Is that machine gun fire I'm hearing, Smith?</i>

01:13:32.712 --> 01:13:34.671
I need more time, lieutenant,
you gotta give me something.

01:13:34.714 --> 01:13:36.063
<i>You have 25 minutes left.</i>

01:13:47.684 --> 01:13:50.774
Modern ammunition
wait for no man, Ranger.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.650
We never finished our dance.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:00.174
This is ridiculous.

01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:02.350
Look at us.

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:06.137
Maybe. But you took my eye.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.792
Each time we meet,
you get the worst of it.

01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.099
Beginner's luck. Ha.

01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:16.103
Three times?
Throw in the towel, son.

01:14:16.147 --> 01:14:19.106
Maybe I got hit in the head
too many times, Ranger.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:24.329
But to get to him,
you must go through me.

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.233
Stay down, Oleg.

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:28.409
Not possible.

01:16:28.453 --> 01:16:30.586
It don't need to be like this.

01:16:49.779 --> 01:16:50.867
Fuck.

01:16:52.085 --> 01:16:53.652
What the fuck?

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:56.002
You look like you've
been hit by a truck.

01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:59.179
- I'm just an observer, Smith.
- Only that was like

01:16:59.223 --> 01:17:02.095
the fourth fucking time.

01:17:02.139 --> 01:17:04.707
Just need to catch my breath.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.273
Okay, I mean, take a minute,

01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:10.190
- but we kind of need to go.
- I'm good to go.

01:17:10.234 --> 01:17:11.539
You sure?

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.585
- Good to go.
- Okay, take this gun.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.588
We've got 20 minutes.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.895
McBride is dug in
on the seventh floor.

01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:22.899
Right.

01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:28.992
The raw isotope has now
impregnated the explosive.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:30.950
RDD is ready for
the final mission, sir.

01:17:35.912 --> 01:17:38.871
I don't expect allegiance from
any of you when the job's done.

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:42.658
I'll understand if you
and your men want to cut out.

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:45.356
We've spoken about it,
and we stand by you.

01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:50.927
No one else fucking has.

01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:55.279
Not women,

01:17:56.976 --> 01:17:58.064
family,

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.067
even friends.

01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:05.028
Yous the only ones that have.

01:18:07.378 --> 01:18:08.553
Well, then,

01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:10.947
Let's get to it, shall we?

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.487
All 11 targets painted, ma'am.

01:18:30.096 --> 01:18:31.619
<i>Ready to engage
at your command.</i>

01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:36.886
You're a hundred percent sure
you can neutralize the threat?

01:18:36.929 --> 01:18:38.757
<i>They have not armed
the uranium device.</i>

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:41.629
We can hit them now, but the
window closes if they arm it.

01:18:41.673 --> 01:18:43.153
We are on the sixth floor,

01:18:43.196 --> 01:18:44.807
so just keep
that fire localized.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.765
You may wanna brace
for this, Ranger.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:49.812
<i>Smith, you need to move.
Move now.</i>

01:18:50.682 --> 01:18:52.684
<i>We have two 84-millimeter
rocket launchers</i>

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.381
<i>ready to fire.</i>

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.687
Fuck!

01:18:56.688 --> 01:18:58.211
Engage the enemy, gentlemen.

01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.647
Fire!

01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:19.842
Hit it.

01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:23.557
Hold your fucking fire.
I'm coming out.

01:20:24.689 --> 01:20:25.821
I'm coming out.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.738
I'm throwing my gun.

01:20:30.782 --> 01:20:32.088
We've got him.

01:20:43.273 --> 01:20:47.625
Declan McBride, you're not
an easy man to find.

01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:51.324
Why don't you show me
them hands, son?

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:57.113
Here's two I prepared earlier.

01:20:57.156 --> 01:20:59.898
Shoot me. We'll salute
St. Michael together.

01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:02.335
Get on your fucking knees now.

01:21:02.379 --> 01:21:05.121
Careful, Ranger.
Put the gun down.

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:07.514
You may be suicidal.

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:09.952
Her? Not so sure.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:14.086
No matter how far
I have to track you,

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.566
whatever it takes,

01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:20.832
I guarantee I will not quit
until you're behind bars

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.312
or six feet under.

01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:25.619
Well, then...

01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:27.360
Good luck to you, Ranger.

01:21:35.716 --> 01:21:38.154
I repeat, he's on the run.

01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:00.219
<i>Lost sight
of McBride, Smith.</i>

01:22:00.263 --> 01:22:03.092
<i>Repeat. We do not have
eyes on the target.</i>

01:22:03.135 --> 01:22:05.529
<i>McBride is Charlie Foxtrot.</i>

01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:17.280
<i>Orwell said
that people sleep peaceably in their beds at night</i>

01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:20.979
because rough men, and
in our case, rough women,

01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:25.941
stand ready to do violence
on their behalf.

01:22:25.984 --> 01:22:29.335
The world owes you both
a great debt of appreciation,

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:33.949
and I want to thank you
on behalf of the agency.

01:22:35.646 --> 01:22:38.910
Agent Smith, you'll
return to your unit.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:42.131
Ranger Tyree, I assume
you'll be leaving us

01:22:42.174 --> 01:22:44.394
at your earliest convenience.

01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:46.744
Well, I am, and I will.

01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:49.442
Happy trails.

01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:51.618
I'll be checking my mail.

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.881
Seven and three-eighths
cattleman.

01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:55.274
You want boots to go with it?

01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:57.842
Just the hat, Ranger.

01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:05.458
You're not going home,
are you, Ranger?

01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:06.894
Ah, things...

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.680
ain't that simple.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.858
We're done. Good guys won.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:16.208
Got your payback.

01:23:19.559 --> 01:23:22.780
When Ranger Daniels
graduated from the academy,

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:26.523
married his high school sweetheart.

01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:33.008
At their wedding,
I promised her I'd look out for him.

01:23:35.445 --> 01:23:37.316
That promise ended
in the dirt,

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.538
side of the road
in Laredo County, so...

01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:46.238
I've got to make good on that.

01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:47.544
You're going after him?

01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:50.460
Don't reckon I have a choice.

01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:40.205
The DEA drone
over Sinaloa, Mexico

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:43.078
spotted what they think
is a smuggling outfit

01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.818
led by McBride.

01:24:44.862 --> 01:24:46.342
They have me
deep in another project,

01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:48.387
or I would be there with you.

01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:50.868
I'll send you all
the information we have.

01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:52.217
Good luck, Alex.

01:26:57.864 --> 01:26:59.301
Ranger Tyree.

01:27:00.476 --> 01:27:01.955
You come all the way
down here for me?

01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:06.003
It's the law of the jungle
out here.

01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:08.005
You ready to commit
to that, Ranger?

01:27:08.658 --> 01:27:09.920
Get your boots on.

01:27:19.973 --> 01:27:21.540
You gonna kill all of us?

01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:24.064
Well, I'd prefer not to.

01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:27.851
You're all on your lonesome.

01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:30.288
I asked you to get
your boots on.

01:27:31.637 --> 01:27:33.422
Don't make me repeat myself.

01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:37.034
Fine.

01:27:42.735 --> 01:27:44.128
That was foolish.

01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.390
Agh!

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.831
Don't you have a life, Ranger?

01:29:20.616 --> 01:29:23.532
There's two types
in this game, McBride.

01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:28.232
Those on the run,
and those doing the hunting.

01:29:30.103 --> 01:29:31.801
Dead or alive.

01:29:33.542 --> 01:29:34.934
Your choice.

01:29:42.202 --> 01:29:43.769
I thought so.

01:29:43.813 --> 01:29:48.165
Tie something around that leg.
Use it as a tourniquet.

01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:49.558
It's a long walk.

01:29:52.604 --> 01:29:54.301
You got this covered, Ranger?

01:29:54.345 --> 01:29:55.520
Chief.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.916
You're gonna find a mess
of deceased smugglers back yonder.

01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:01.874
Once again,
I'm indebted to you.

01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:04.268
Many people
will not think it so.

01:30:06.357 --> 01:30:09.578
I believe a man should always
celebrate a job well done.

01:30:10.187 --> 01:30:11.275
<i>Ciggaro?</i>

01:30:11.318 --> 01:30:13.799
I like your line
of reasoning, chief.

01:30:16.933 --> 01:30:19.762
All right.

01:30:19.805 --> 01:30:21.154
It might be
a better arrangement

01:30:21.198 --> 01:30:23.069
to have the Irishman
buried with his mules.

01:30:23.113 --> 01:30:24.767
You know, I'm right here, chief.

01:30:25.724 --> 01:30:28.335
Might just come
to that, Ignacio.

01:30:28.379 --> 01:30:31.121
I might suggest to stay
clear out of Mexico

01:30:31.164 --> 01:30:33.689
for a-- a decade or so.

01:30:53.883 --> 01:30:55.319
Adios, Ranger!

01:30:56.363 --> 01:30:58.453
And that's all
it took to take me down?

01:30:58.496 --> 01:31:00.585
One riot, and one
fucking ranger.

01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:02.326
Just doing my job.
