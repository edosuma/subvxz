02:44.520 --> 02:46.240
Straight to the morgue, sir?

02:46.760 --> 02:49.440
No. Take me to where it happened.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.320
Pont de l'Alma.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.360
There is no power
nor strength except by Allah.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.200
There is no power
nor strength except by Allah.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.040
We retrieved some of the princess' clothes

13:09.040 --> 13:10.480
from Mr. Dodi's apartment.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.560
Gifts she apparently bought for her sons,

13:14.240 --> 13:16.640
and a poem, engraved on a silver plaque.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.720
We believe
it was given to her by Mr. Dodi.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.640
It was a love for the ages.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.400
They were engaged to be married, you know.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.720
Dodi proposed to her last night.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.040
Return the possessions to her family.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.400
I will also write to both the royal family
and the Spencer family.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.480
This tragedy will bring us together.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.680
I am their brother in sorrow.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.280
Mr. President.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.600
Still nothing from the Palace?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.520
No.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.320
But we sent flowers?

28:09.200 --> 28:10.040
Yes.

28:10.920 --> 28:14.240
And letters and gifts? No word at all?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.080
No.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.280
And the poem I sent
to be placed in Diana's coffin?

28:20.400 --> 28:21.480
It was returned.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.040
Without acknowledgement.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.120
Why do they hate me?

28:40.240 --> 28:44.000
Is it the fate of Arabs
to always be hated by the West?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.360
Don't take it personally.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.280
How can I not?

28:54.680 --> 28:59.600
Look. There's no mention of you anywhere!

29:01.200 --> 29:03.160
It's as if only one person died.

29:04.840 --> 29:10.680
But in Cairo, Beirut, Baghdad,
across the whole Arab world,

29:11.960 --> 29:13.320
they are calling me a hero.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.400
You shouldn't look up to the West.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.280
Of course I look up to the West.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.280
You shouldn't.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.920
Exalted expectations are not fair.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.640
They can never be fulfilled.

29:43.280 --> 29:48.200
Did I have unfair expectations of you?

29:55.120 --> 29:58.160
Forgive me.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.760
Forgive me.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.360
For failing you.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.000
You were perfect.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
No, I wasn't.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.440
Be honest about who I was.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.400
Because wounds will only heal
with the truth.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.640
No, Dodi, no!

30:41.520 --> 30:43.240
Don't leave me!
