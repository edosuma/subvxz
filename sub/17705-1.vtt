08:51.042 --> 08:53.292
need to have with your employer.

08:53.334 --> 08:55.125
- Ah, I work for no man.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.751
I work for the Fleurs-de-Lis.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.709
- You work for

08:56.792 --> 08:58.709
the highest bidder.

08:58.751 --> 09:01.125
Samuel Grant,

09:01.167 --> 09:03.667
a wealthy American

09:01.167 --> 09:03.667
new to Montreal.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.709
- Grant is one of several men

09:03.709 --> 09:05.709
with whom I do business.

09:05.751 --> 09:07.417
- I wanna meet him.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.667
- (Small chuckle) No.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.500
Why would you want such a thing?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.334
- Do not overestimate

09:14.375 --> 09:16.334
your standing.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.167
You're just the middleman.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.792
- I cannot do business

09:21.000 --> 09:22.792
like this.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.167
- I guess I'll take my business

09:24.209 --> 09:25.334
to one of your competitors.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.250
- No, okay, okay!

09:27.292 --> 09:29.417
I'll speak to Grant.

09:29.459 --> 09:31.918
I'll try to set up a meeting,

09:31.959 --> 09:33.834
but he's going to ask

09:31.959 --> 09:33.834
what you have to offer.

09:33.876 --> 09:36.375
This amount of furs

09:33.876 --> 09:36.375
will not be enough.

(Woodpecker pecks)

09:38.125 --> 09:38.959
(Waves lap gently)

09:41.375 --> 09:42.542

09:44.209 --> 09:46.167
- The Cree?

09:46.209 --> 09:48.083
You have an agreement

09:46.209 --> 09:48.083
with them for trade?

09:48.125 --> 09:49.083
- I will.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.334
- Fine.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.292
But if you cut me out

09:53.375 --> 09:55.292
of this you...

09:55.334 --> 09:57.375
uh, you will, uh, very badly

09:55.334 --> 09:57.375

09:59.792 --> 10:01.459

Guard: Lord Benton is in some

10:18.709 --> 10:20.125

(Laughing)

26:23.542 --> 26:24.250
Uh...

26:26.834 --> 26:30.417
I-I need you to travel North

26:26.834 --> 26:30.417
with me up to James Bay.

26:30.459 --> 26:32.500
There's someone you should meet.

26:32.542 --> 26:34.459
- You asked me to meet with you

26:34.500 --> 26:36.417
so that you could ask me

26:36.459 --> 26:38.209
to meet with someone else?

26:38.250 --> 26:39.626
- Well, when you put it that way

26:39.667 --> 26:42.626
it seems somehow a bit silly,

26:42.667 --> 26:44.125
but, uh, this man

26:42.667 --> 26:44.125
is a special supplier

26:46.584 --> 26:49.626
looking for a particular

26:46.584 --> 26:49.626
type of buyer.

26:49.667 --> 26:52.209
- So why didn't you bring

26:49.667 --> 26:52.209
him here?

26:52.250 --> 26:53.584
- We have to go to him.

26:58.167 --> 27:00.250
- I pay you to meet with

26:58.167 --> 27:00.250
these suppliers

27:00.292 --> 27:01.584
so that I don't have to.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.292
Perhaps I should find

27:03.834 --> 27:05.292
someone else

27:05.334 --> 27:06.125
who understands what I need.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.334
Rivard: What, like a wife, eh?

27:14.417 --> 27:16.584
(Stutters)

27:16.626 --> 27:17.751
He will only speak with you.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.334
Mr. Grant, I would hate for

27:20.792 --> 27:23.334
you to miss an opportunity

27:23.375 --> 27:25.500
to make a lot of money.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.626
- And who is this supplier?

27:27.667 --> 27:29.000
- Declan Harp.

27:31.292 --> 27:33.709
Grant and Pond: (Chuckle)

27:33.751 --> 27:35.542
- The man who used to work

27:33.751 --> 27:35.542
for the Hudson's Bay Company

27:35.584 --> 27:37.584
and now steals from them?

27:37.626 --> 27:40.751
That's who you want me to meet?

27:40.792 --> 27:42.375
- It sounds bad when you put it

27:40.792 --> 27:42.375
like that.

27:42.417 --> 27:43.375
Grant: Does it?

27:46.959 --> 27:50.042
I've no intention of traveling

27:46.959 --> 27:50.042
into the wilderness

27:50.083 --> 27:52.417
to meet with a notorious

27:50.083 --> 27:52.417
cutthroat.

27:52.459 --> 27:54.834
You may leave me.

27:54.876 --> 27:56.959
- No, no, no! You two have much

27:54.876 --> 27:56.959
in common, Mr. Grant!

27:57.000 --> 27:58.459
You are both men on the rise!

28:00.751 --> 28:03.000

Harp's power is growing.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.209

- Also a guide.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.209
Call it a sideline,

31:17.250 --> 31:20.417

31:17.250 --> 31:20.417
this wild land, Michael Smyth.

31:20.459 --> 31:22.584
I can find whatever piece of

wilderness you're looking for.

31:25.334 --> 31:27.042
- Oh?

31:27.083 --> 31:29.000
- Goes by the name

31:27.083 --> 31:29.000
of Declan Harp.

31:29.042 --> 31:30.792
- Extremely unwise.

31:30.834 --> 31:34.125
Harp is a madman.

31:34.167 --> 31:36.209
- Maybe I should look

31:34.167 --> 31:36.209
for another guide then?

31:36.250 --> 31:39.250
- Wait a moment, my son.

31:39.292 --> 31:42.125
Are you sure you have enough

31:39.292 --> 31:42.125
silver to pay for a good guide?

31:42.167 --> 31:45.292
(Coins clink)

31:42.167 --> 31:45.292

32:07.417 --> 32:09.125

32:07.417 --> 32:09.125
paid for our ale,

And then some.

32:22.459 --> 32:23.792
- So you're a thief?

32:23.834 --> 32:26.167

32:26.209 --> 32:28.500
We all have one, you know.

32:28.542 --> 32:30.334
- Are you gonna rob me too

32:28.542 --> 32:30.334
when I turn me back?

32:30.375 --> 32:32.876
- Of course not!

32:30.375 --> 32:32.876
You have so little.

32:32.918 --> 32:35.042
Which is good,

32:35.083 --> 32:38.000
because it means you don't have

32:35.083 --> 32:38.000
the sickness yet.

32:38.042 --> 32:40.042
- The sickness?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.626
- When you put too much silver

32:40.083 --> 32:41.626
in the hands

32:41.667 --> 32:43.709
of the kinds of people

32:41.667 --> 32:43.709
who come here,

32:43.751 --> 32:45.292
it awakens something.

32:45.334 --> 32:46.209
- Drunkenness and thievery?

32:46.250 --> 32:48.918
- Yes...

32:48.959 --> 32:51.250
among other things,

32:48.959 --> 32:51.250
and a need for more.

32:51.292 --> 32:52.918
(Inhales sharply)

32:52.959 --> 32:55.834
Some people have

33:02.125 --> 33:03.334
- Yes, Miss Emberly.

33:06.125 --> 33:09.417
Coffin: Most think the sickness

33:06.125 --> 33:09.417
is about money,

33:09.459 --> 33:12.042
Michael.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.918
Some want more power,

33:14.959 --> 33:17.500

the power they have.

33:17.542 --> 33:19.292
When someone gains more,

33:19.334 --> 33:22.292
someone else has to lose it.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.375
You have to be careful here

33:25.834 --> 33:27.542
or you will get pulled in

33:25.834 --> 33:27.542
by the sickness too.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
And you have to know

33:33.042 --> 33:34.876
that going to the interior

33:33.042 --> 33:34.876

33:36.667 --> 33:39.459

33:50.626 --> 33:53.959
who can give it to you.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.959

38:35.834 --> 38:37.876

He seems to think I owe him

39:33.334 --> 39:35.959
money for a gambling debt.

you leave me passed out drunk.

What kind of priest are ya?!

39:39.542 --> 39:41.792
are you in need of?

Go home!

40:03.209 --> 40:05.209
that this is not

40:03.209 --> 40:05.209

40:14.792 --> 40:17.000

40:17.042 --> 40:18.751
This silver would get me home,

40:22.626 --> 40:24.459
I made a deal with Lord Benton,

I have no choice.
