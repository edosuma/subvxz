-NARRATOR:<i> Previously on</i> Boston Legal...
-You wanted to see me, Shirley?

00:03.920 --> 00:06.965
I'm very sorry,
but you won't be making partner.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.591
-(shouts)
-(all gasp)

00:08.675 --> 00:13.388
Jerry Espenson has been suffering
needlessly his entire life.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.849
Now he has a chance
to find a measure of peace.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.225
That's justice, Shirley.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.227
To friendship, my colleague.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.522
Right on my balcony?

00:23.398 --> 00:25.400
I don't want you on my balc--

00:25.483 --> 00:29.279
On... on any balcony, alone,
with that man.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.363
Okay.

Jerry. (chuckles) Always a surprise.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.316
Shirley.

01:07.192 --> 01:12.322
First, I bear no ill will towards you
for totally screwing me out of partner.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.783
Thank you, and, uh...

01:15.158 --> 01:18.328
no hard feelings here
for you trying to slit my throat.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.580
(sighs) I'm very embarrassed over that.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.790
Don't beat yourself up.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.376
Wha... what's on your mind, Jerry?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.005
I want my job back.

01:31.716 --> 01:35.345
I built myself a nice little practice.
Here's a list of clients.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.472
-Many are blue-chip.

01:38.098 --> 01:42.060
Having succeeded
in building your own firm,

01:42.143 --> 01:43.520
why would you wanna come back?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.480
I miss the camaraderie.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.857
(scoffs) Jerry, you never spoke to anyone.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.026
I've improved in that department.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.737
Wha... what is it really, Jerry?

01:52.821 --> 01:57.700
(exhales deeply)
Well, last week, I had a case.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.579
Against Clarence Bell, actually,
a lovely man who works here.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.624
I was rather ugly in the trial, cutthroat.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.584
I've become more and more aware

02:06.668 --> 02:10.505
that's what you must be sometimes
in order to win cases, which I can accept.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.175
But you have to be that way far too often

02:14.259 --> 02:17.137
in order to compete in the marketplace,

02:17.220 --> 02:20.765
whether it's poaching clients
or beating up vendors.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.269
It's a very cruel world out there.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.854
I hadn't noticed.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.357
I don't want to be that way.
It's not who I am.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.990
I'll tell you what,
I will think about this.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.660
Any request this outrageous
deserves attention.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.497
But I do have a rule of thumb
when I hire people.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.501
I need to be convinced
they could be happy here.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.962
Oh, I could be. Shirley, I assure you.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.464
Just the thought of getting
to come back here again

02:53.548 --> 02:54.674
puts a song in my heart.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.010
I actually walk about
singing it in my head.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.095
You... you sing a song in your head?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.597
(chuckles) Yes.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.683
-Could you hum a few bars?
-(chuckles)

03:04.350 --> 03:05.185
Very good.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.188
No, really,
I... I would like to hear the song.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.815

On what grounds
were you arrested, Mr. Kallah?

03:54.484 --> 03:57.070
I was suspected of having ties
to Al-Qaeda, which is ridiculous.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.365
I'm assuming
you're not an American citizen.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.033
-I'm British.
-Commie.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.536
My sister is an American citizen
through marriage.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.248
-I'm applying for citizenship.
-Are you on a no-flying list?

04:08.957 --> 04:12.126
I have been. Went to rehab.
They love me now.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.171
Why were you in Afghanistan
in the first place?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.881
I was there on a humanitarian effort,

04:16.965 --> 04:19.759
bringing food, medical supplies
to some impoverished villages.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.761
I was arrested
by US intelligence officers.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.388
And sent to Guantanamo.

04:24.889 --> 04:25.932
For two years.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.269
Who won the Super Bowl?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.355
It'll be on the test.
I'm just trying to help, son.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.275
Mr. Kallah, you're a Harvard-educated man,

04:35.358 --> 04:37.527
presumably, well-informed.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.113
If you've so much as bothered
to read the newspapers,

04:40.196 --> 04:42.323
which not everybody does, I grant you,

04:42.407 --> 04:45.159
it can interfere with leadership skills.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.704
You know, uh, suing for abuse
at Guantanamo

04:47.787 --> 04:49.080
is next to impossible.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.457
-Which is why I've come to you.
-Commie.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.128
I was tortured by agents
of the United States.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.171
I should get to sue the United States.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.215
I don't know
what tribe you're from, sport.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.675
But this is America.

05:00.758 --> 05:04.178
Human rights are so yesterday here.
Get with the program.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.308
What?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.728
Mr. Kallah, you can thank Denny Crane.
He's just persuaded me to take your case.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.743
Have you lost your mind?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.995
More times than I care to mention, Judge.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.205
And it seems like each time
with a different woman.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.457
Are you free for lunch?

05:33.708 --> 05:37.628
Mr. Shore, it would not be wise
to make sexual advances.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.047
I tend to accept them.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.883
Can we turn to the case?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.136
I've completely forgotten what it's about.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.140
Your Honor, perhaps
you could refresh me over lunch.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.685
It's about you suing the government
for Guantanamo abuses,

05:52.769 --> 05:56.105
bringing it in state court, no less,
instead of federal, where it belongs.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.649
And the courts have ruled
it doesn't even belong there.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.735
It's barred on jurisdictional grounds.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.863
My father used to say to me,
"Never accept no for an answer."

06:03.946 --> 06:06.032
Of course, he'd spank me
if I didn't accept it from him.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.992
-Do you spank, Your Honor?
-I jail.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.371
Thirty seconds as to why
I should entertain this lawsuit.

06:11.454 --> 06:15.124
Okay, I realize the jurisdictional
barriers are prohibitive,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.293
but, Your Honor,
we don't let little things like the law

06:17.377 --> 06:18.920
stand in our way in this great country.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.714
The law, for example,
recognizes the Geneva Convention,

06:21.798 --> 06:23.049
but we say the hell with it.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.260
The law has very strict regulations
on domestic wiretapping,

06:26.344 --> 06:27.345
we say the hell with it.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.514
The law says,
if you shoot somebody with a shotgun,

06:29.597 --> 06:32.308
mistaking him for a quail,
you really should call the police.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.269
-Mr. Shore.
-We're cowboys, Judge. We do what we want,

06:35.353 --> 06:37.855
whether it's starting wars,
changing daylight savings time.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.982
We like to play it fast and loose
in this country,

06:40.066 --> 06:41.359
making it up as we go along.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.693
You're not helping yourself.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.946
Your Honor, there's a rumor about you.

06:45.029 --> 06:45.988
Several, actually.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.990
But, the rumor I speak of
is that you give a damn.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.827
That's why I'm here.
If I'm wrong, no hard feelings.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.869
I'm still free for lunch.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.125
I will listen to your client
just to determine

06:57.208 --> 06:59.460
if I'll even accept this case
on jurisdictional grounds.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.379
You're not serious.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.713
Two o'clock. Adjourned.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.426
Don't you be taking
your pants off for her.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.095
-You read my mind.
-I'm serious, Alan.

07:09.178 --> 07:13.349
She's famous for telling lawyers
to drop trou in her chambers.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.476
And more times than not, they do it.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.396
I'll only be dropping trou for you.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.857
You are so sweet.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.609
Are you becoming a romantic, Alan?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.862
Well, now, that you mention it...

07:35.037 --> 07:37.832
(giggles) Oh, my God.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.377
Did you know
yellow roses were my favorite?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.795
I asked around.

07:43.212 --> 07:47.175
Six. You know,
I just lost six yellow roses.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.593
This is perfect.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.637
-I had a dozen in my office...
-Oh.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.016
And six mysteriously disappeared.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.018
-Hmm.
-And wow.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.520
-(chuckles)
-This is fate, I guess.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.523
You're the best.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.408
She's not good for you.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.285
-Why not?
-She just isn't.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.078
A woman knows these things. Trust me.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.830
Denny, you're not a woman.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.499
-Whatever.
-(scoffs)

08:19.582 --> 08:21.083
(sighs) I don't like her.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.503
-You're jealous.
-Not jealous.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.296
-Denny.
-It isn't that.

08:26.422 --> 08:30.635
(sighs) But it's where you'll be going now
for all of your sleepovers.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.178
Not all, I promise.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.640
Don't like you representing
a commie terrorist.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.809
-He's not a terrorist.
-Can't you just once be for this country?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.437
I am for this country.
I love this country.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.523
And can't you just once love George Bush?

08:43.606 --> 08:47.276
Well, that presents a slightly...
bigger challenge.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.071
But I'll tell you what,
invite him to go fishing with us.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.822
-The president?
-Why not?

08:51.906 --> 08:55.076
Well, I doubt he knows how to fish.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.161
Denny, he's leader of the free world.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.457
Surely, he must be capable
of outsmarting a salmon.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.878
No?

09:06.921 --> 09:09.465
I don't want you sleeping with that woman.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.553
And I don't want you attacking my country.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.848
-Stop looking at me.
-Denny.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.101
I know you're looking at me.
I asked you to stop.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.311
-Fine.
-Fine.

09:26.482 --> 09:31.112
Okay, I've thought about it.
And I still have a few questions.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.114
First...

09:35.992 --> 09:37.159
Really, Jerry?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.245
(gasps) Really.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.374
The best times of my life were here.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.835
Which part exactly?

09:45.918 --> 09:48.504
Being ostracized? Turned down for partner?

09:48.588 --> 09:51.632
The arrest for attempted murder?
I realize it was all good.

09:53.301 --> 09:57.054
Most office places,
everybody's mired in their computers

09:57.138 --> 10:00.182
or Blackberries, on their cell phones,
even in the bathrooms.

10:00.558 --> 10:04.604
Most exchanges take place
by e-mail, text message or IM.

10:04.687 --> 10:09.066
It's become such an impersonal universe.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.318
Here...

10:10.943 --> 10:13.529
everyone is so in each other's faces.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.116
I realize now, it's quite magical.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.327
Personally,
I could do with a little less magic.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.581
How joyous that you people
actually know one another.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.000
Could it be any more human?

10:26.083 --> 10:29.086
No matter where you look,
one's got mad cow.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.965
You've got the funny one
who salutes and does push-ups.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.926
There's the transvestite
and the girl who loves him.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.970
A dwarf who comes and goes.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.222
And how to begin to explain... Alan.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.265
(both chuckle)

10:42.516 --> 10:46.437
Certainly,
you can make room for one lawyer

10:46.896 --> 10:50.816
who keeps his hands
on his thighs and purrs.

10:53.944 --> 10:54.987
And then there's you...

10:55.488 --> 10:58.908
who's actually considering
rehiring a man who...

10:59.825 --> 11:02.328
held a serrated cake knife to your throat.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.999
Such compassion for forgiveness.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.170
That makes you the most human of them all.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.299
(sighs)

11:16.592 --> 11:17.718
Okay.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.554
First, that was very good.

11:21.722 --> 11:25.267
Second, it was actually mo... moving.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.855
Let me see
if I can run this up the flagpole.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.818
-Oh!
-It is not a yes yet, Jerry.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.112
But maybe I can cause
some of the others here

11:36.195 --> 11:37.613
to also lose their mind.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.156
-But--
-Thank you, Shirl!

11:39.240 --> 11:41.117
-It's Shirley. You can go now.
-Yeah.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.833
My hopes are so high,

11:48.916 --> 11:51.293
I have to do a higher hop
just to see them.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.295
I know the feeling.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.509
(gasps)

12:05.307 --> 12:06.434
(reporters clamoring)

12:07.143 --> 12:09.854
I'm sorry, I have no comment.
Denny, do you have any comment?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.439
(clamoring continues)

12:11.522 --> 12:14.650
I have nothing
against Guantanamo by the bay.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.236
I happen to like resorts.
And as for suing the country,

12:17.319 --> 12:19.655
well, I think it's wrong,
but the client paid the money.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.781
But let me say this.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.324
In no other country

12:22.408 --> 12:26.036
can you challenge a government
like you can in the US of A.

12:26.120 --> 12:30.374
And that's what freedom's all about,
the right to express unpopular opinions.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.670
Except if you have Arab blood,
then it's straight to Cuba you go.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.880
We're in a war here, guys. Come on.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.465
-REPORTER: Crane!
-Denny Crane.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.843
Did anybody tell you
why you were being arrested?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.888
No. I was grabbed, taken to a cell.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.223
A day later, I was interrogated.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.060
I was able to deduce from the questions
that I was believed to have connections

12:50.144 --> 12:51.771
to either Al-Qaeda or the Taliban.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.398
What evidence did they present
to support this suspicion?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.902
I have never, ever been presented
with any evidence.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.946
Two years later,
after being abused and tortured,

13:01.030 --> 13:02.031
I was released.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.283
There, again, no reason was ever given.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.036
-Did you have a lawyer?
-We were not allowed to have lawyers.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.457
You told them that you had been living
in the United States on a visa

13:11.540 --> 13:13.375
while attending Harvard University?

13:14.418 --> 13:15.586
They were not impressed.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.924
Mr. Kallah,
you've stated that you were tortured.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.969
Can you give us an example?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.306
I was beaten.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.309
Repeatedly deprived of sleep.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.271
I was forced to wear a hood over my head.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.273
Sometimes, for days.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.735
(sighs) I was sexually humiliated.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.278
How so?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.281
I'd rather not go into it.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.077
And what else?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.163
I was forced to lie in a fetal position...

13:52.081 --> 13:54.291
my eyes and my mouth duct taped.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.836
The worst part...

13:58.754 --> 14:00.381
was that we felt it was forever.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.301
We were never gonna be released.
We were never gonna get a trial.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.555
One man, Ali--

14:09.515 --> 14:10.474
A friend.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.768
He was arrested with me.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.022
What happened to your friend, sir?

14:19.233 --> 14:20.442
Finally, he couldn't take it.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.237
(sighs)

14:24.488 --> 14:25.447
He hung himself.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.117
ALAN: He committed suicide?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.620
The Pentagon called it
"manipulative, self-injurious behavior,

14:32.329 --> 14:36.292
an act of asymmetric warfare
engaged against the United States."

14:37.751 --> 14:39.086
Was your friend a terrorist?

14:41.463 --> 14:42.798
No, he was a doctor.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.681
-He tried to kill you.
-Not really.

14:50.764 --> 14:54.018
And let's face it,
we did sort of screw him.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.896
No, we denied him partnership,
which is our right.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.481
He pulled a knife, not his right.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.816
Look, I know it's nuts.

15:00.900 --> 15:05.237
But there were mitigating circumstances,
his Asperger's being one.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.323
He's become a pretty good litigator,

15:07.406 --> 15:10.034
and we're about to lose Denise
to maternity any day now.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.493
We could use the help.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.663
Let's just do it on a trial basis,

15:15.080 --> 15:19.251
if for no other reason
than to assuage my conscience.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.760
The charitable organization that you
worked for was based out of Pakistan?

15:28.552 --> 15:30.387
-Yes.
-You're aware that the organization

15:30.471 --> 15:32.264
has been linked to Al-Qaeda?

15:33.015 --> 15:35.267
When you're trying to do aid work
in a Taliban-controlled area,

15:35.351 --> 15:37.269
-deals have to be made.
-As in Al-Qaeda?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.438
The Taliban and Al-Qaeda
saw humanitarian efforts

15:39.521 --> 15:40.773
as part of the US offensive.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.276
We saw hungry kids.
We did what was necessary to feed them.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.364
So, would you describe yourself
as being cooperative

15:48.447 --> 15:51.283
with the officials
that detained you or... hostile?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.953
Well, I protested my innocence.
If you call that uncooperative--

15:54.036 --> 15:56.288
Thank you.
And, sir, you were initially detained

15:56.372 --> 15:57.706
by Afghani tribesmen, were you not?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.918
They turned you over to US authorities,
alleging that you were Al-Qaeda.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.837
Afghani tribesmen were offered
cash rewards to turn people in.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.299
The CIA had posters
promising millions of dollars.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.301
Afghani tribesmen
were surrendering their own mothers.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.928
Well, can you present any evidence

16:11.011 --> 16:13.055
that would prove
that you were not connected to Al-Qaeda?

16:13.639 --> 16:16.850
Can I prove a negative?
Are we being asked to do that now?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.236
(sirens wailing)

16:31.615 --> 16:33.200
You're making a big mistake.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.287
Tell me.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.833
Nobody cares.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.586
Guantanamo Schwantanamo. This is America.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.922
We don't care.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.675
Why is that, Denny?

16:50.134 --> 16:52.011
The United States is torturing people,

16:52.094 --> 16:54.805
denying them any semblance of due process.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.599
How did we suddenly become
a people who don't care?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.186
-9/11.
-(scoffs)

17:01.645 --> 17:05.607
9/11 just gives us carte blanche
to abolish human rights.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.817
How can that be so?

17:07.359 --> 17:10.362
First, it's so because God said so.
He told Bush.

17:11.822 --> 17:15.034
Second, we don't care 'cause it's
happening in some third world country.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.660
-(scoffs)
-We can't relate.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.579
It's happening in Cuba...

17:19.329 --> 17:21.582
a few hundred miles
off the coast of Florida.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.960
You remember Florida, Denny.
God told them to punch the wrong chad.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.671
Alan, today, it's help the Cubans.

17:27.755 --> 17:32.593
Tomorrow, it's let's go to Darfur
and help the Darfurians.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.136
We can't be there for everybody.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.764
That can't make sense, even to you.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.185
You want to make sense of it all?
Here it is.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.483
We don't care about human rights.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.984
That's the old America.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.987
Now we just don't want to get blown up.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.614
Simple as that.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.450
Eh, torture a few Cubans along the way.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.118
Big deal. They're not Americans.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.037
It's not happening here, so...

18:00.913 --> 18:01.914
we don't care.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.957
And the judge won't either.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.794
Oh, she's sexy. I'll give you that.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.171
And nasty too, I'll bet.
Think she's nasty?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.382
She's nasty.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.391
(lively music plays)

18:25.771 --> 18:28.357
(inhales deeply) You asked to see me.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.317
Yes.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.613
Take your pants off.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.699
-I beg your pardon?
-You heard me.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.745
Counselor,

18:41.829 --> 18:44.248
do you want me to consider
jurisdiction here or not?

18:46.375 --> 18:51.463
Do you mean to say you'll dismiss my case
if I don't drop my trousers?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.507
No.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.553
But most of the lawyers
are happy to do it, by the way.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.015
I called you in to tell you I'm allowing
the government to put on a witness.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.184
-An army colonel.
-To say what?

19:04.268 --> 19:05.602
The other side.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.274
He'll be taking the stand.
You officially have notice. That's all.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.445
Do most lawyers really
take their pants off for you?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.198
Why not? It's exciting.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.658
For them?

19:21.410 --> 19:23.203
Yes, actually.

19:23.787 --> 19:27.291
The thought of me looking at them,
perhaps getting aroused...

19:27.749 --> 19:29.168
it titillates them.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.005
Imagine for a moment
me looking at you, Mr. Shore,

19:34.006 --> 19:35.799
privately getting aroused.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.969
Perhaps,
I even give myself away with a look.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.638
Does it not excite you?

19:42.264 --> 19:46.101
Are you not getting a little thrill
just thinking about it right now?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.188
Not so little.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.442
4:00 p.m. Be on time.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.414
(scoffs)

20:08.040 --> 20:10.042
She asked you to drop your pants?

20:10.125 --> 20:12.211
She likes to play mind games.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.880
I think it's a way for her
to gain dominion over lawyers.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.298
-She wants me.
-Really?

20:16.381 --> 20:18.091
Yeah.
She's going through you to get to me.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.219
Alan, oh, she's a chess player.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.846
It's so obvious.
I'm three moves ahead of her.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.556
I want her, I'll say that.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.642
-She's so nasty.
-I want her.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.894
-You're already in a relationship.
-It's not fair.

20:28.977 --> 20:32.689
I'm very attracted to older women.
And this woman is particularly...

20:33.607 --> 20:35.025
Uh, she's there for me.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.778
All I have to do is go to her,
and I can have her, and I can't.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.572
That's why monogamy,
if it's not against mankind,

20:40.656 --> 20:42.658
is certainly against man.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.785
You've already got a judge.
Let me take this one.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.828
No, I don't want you compromising my case.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.498
-Me? Velvet glove, man.
-Stay away from her, Denny.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.959
And you're in a relationship too,
by the way, with Bethany.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.585
Well, it's on again, off again.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.254
Today, I'll make it off again. No problem.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.588
Stay away from Judge Folger.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.590
(groans softly)

20:59.591 --> 21:02.261
Good news is Paul Lewiston signed off.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.764
Potentially bad news, Denny.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.642
Denny? Denny likes me.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.270
He sometimes pats me on the head
like I'm a labradoodle.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.480
Denny has some issues, Jerry.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.484
It seems you've become close
with his special friend.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.488
-Alan?
-Denny doesn't like to share what's his.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.283
He doesn't even like
to share what's not his.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.453
-He sees you as a threat.
-That's ridiculous.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.332
Bottom line is I can't push this
through without Denny's okay.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.751
You and he need to have a sit-down.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.171
You need to convince him that...

21:39.047 --> 21:40.882
you're not out to steal his man.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.889
The public may not like Guantanamo.
They probably don't understand it.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.975
-But it's necessary.
-Why?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.436
Because it's the only way
we can successfully screen

21:52.519 --> 21:53.645
for terrorist threats.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.273
Do innocent people
get caught in the net sometimes?

21:56.356 --> 21:59.651
Sure, it happens. If so, we release them.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.989
-You didn't release Mr. Kallah.
-COLONEL: Mr. Kallah wouldn't cooperate.

22:04.072 --> 22:07.701
Because of that,
we couldn't successfully screen him.

22:07.784 --> 22:08.952
ATTORNEY: He says you tortured him.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.705
Discomfiture tactics are employed.
They happen to work.

22:11.788 --> 22:15.334
In this day, there's a paramount need
to get information quickly,

22:15.417 --> 22:17.419
before we have another attack like 9/11.

22:17.502 --> 22:21.923
And I might point out that since GTMO
and the application of the Patriot Act,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.593
we have not had another
such attack on American soil.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.928
The American public
should be grateful for that,

22:27.012 --> 22:30.640
instead of waving their arms about,
screaming "human rights."

22:31.683 --> 22:33.894
You just don't see
any gray area here, do you?

22:33.977 --> 22:36.021
You know the gray I see, Counselor?

22:36.104 --> 22:39.316
Fragments of human brains
that used to belong to our soldiers.

22:39.399 --> 22:43.278
What we do at Guantanamo
is designed to save their lives too.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.573
Oh, I've been waiting for that.
It's good for the troops. You win.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.409
Tell me, have you ever seen
any brain matter

22:49.493 --> 22:50.911
from a prisoner at Guantanamo?

22:51.453 --> 22:54.706
That is an offensive question.
I will not answer it.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.584
So, rounding up suspects
from various nations,

22:57.667 --> 23:01.046
interrogating them at facilities
in other countries or on ships,

23:01.129 --> 23:03.757
then sending them off
to a remote US Naval base

23:03.840 --> 23:05.634
that's been repurposed as a dumping ground

23:05.717 --> 23:08.804
for people whose civil rights
we'd really rather not consider,

23:08.887 --> 23:11.681
it's necessary, and it works. Excellent.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.394
I suppose the Boston Police Department
is necessary and effective as well,

23:15.477 --> 23:17.854
as are most other police departments
in this country.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.481
-Would you agree?
-I would.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.858
And if they were to arrest
an innocent man,

23:21.942 --> 23:25.362
torture him, hold him for two years,
they would be sued, and they'd pay.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.198
Why shouldn't the American government
compensate Mr. Kallah?

23:28.281 --> 23:30.534
COLONEL: Because this is different.

23:30.617 --> 23:34.162
We have to be overzealous
to have a chance against the terrorists.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.081
It's a war we already can't afford,

23:36.164 --> 23:38.166
and if we have to start
paying out judgments

23:38.250 --> 23:41.086
every time we get it wrong,
that means that more kids

23:41.169 --> 23:43.505
don't get the armor
and equipment they need.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.174
More kids die. More civilians die.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.343
Snide-ass.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.387
Move to strike. He's never seen my ass.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.347
Her Honor would like to,
so it's a sensitive--

23:52.431 --> 23:53.932
Mr. Shore.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.854
Under the Geneva Convention,
prisoners of war can't be tortured.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.731
-Isn't that right, Colonel?
-Uh, they're not considered prisoners.

24:02.315 --> 24:05.527
They're enemy combatants.
The Geneva Convention doesn't apply.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.404
They're not prisoners?

24:07.487 --> 24:09.156
They're more like criminals than soldiers.

24:09.239 --> 24:14.494
Criminals. Well, the Constitution
gives very specific rights to criminals.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.745
Am I correct?

24:15.829 --> 24:17.706
Uh, such as, uh, a lawyer, a trial--

24:17.789 --> 24:20.125
He is not a United States citizen.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.210
-The Constitution doesn't apply.
-ALAN: Ah!

24:22.294 --> 24:24.963
So no Geneva Convention, no Constitution.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.006
It all works out.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.716
Do they have any rights
we need to bother with?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.969
We are trying to defend
a country against terror.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.304
Oh, yes. For the good of the troops.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.347
-Mr. Shore.
-Yes, Your Honor.

24:34.431 --> 24:35.932
Chambers? Discipline?

24:40.604 --> 24:42.397
You think you're funny?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.066
It's just all this talk
of corporal punishment excites me.

24:45.150 --> 24:45.984
Does it not you?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.378
(sighs)

25:06.505 --> 25:07.589
Whatcha reading?

25:09.132 --> 25:12.010
Do you know what Cheney said
about the Guantanamo prisoners?

25:12.093 --> 25:15.055
He said they're living in the tropics,
they're all well-fed,

25:15.138 --> 25:17.474
they've got everything
they could possibly want.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.812
Has she asked you to drop your pants yet?

25:23.355 --> 25:25.941
-(laughs) What?
-Judge Folger.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.859
Has she asked you yet?

25:28.693 --> 25:29.528
(groans)

25:30.195 --> 25:31.404
(clears throat)

25:33.990 --> 25:35.408
Are you attracted to her?

25:37.410 --> 25:38.286
No.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.545
If I were attracted to her
or any other woman,

25:46.628 --> 25:49.005
would that be a problem?

25:52.425 --> 25:54.886
Of course you're gonna be attracted
to other women.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.890
And you can lust after
whomever you want...

26:00.934 --> 26:03.645
as long as you channel it toward me.

26:07.607 --> 26:08.984
(grunts softly)

26:11.570 --> 26:12.862
(groans softly)

26:14.281 --> 26:18.076
Actually, I do find Judge Folger
somewhat attractive.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.371
For, you know, an older woman.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.335
Fine. Glad to hear it.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.255
-You just said you wouldn't care.
-I don't.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.465
Fine. (sighs)

26:34.593 --> 26:37.721
-I would never act on it, of course.
-Good for you.

26:40.682 --> 26:44.394
-Gloria.
-Don't... touch me.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.912
-You get punished for being honest.
-Of course, you do.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.957
They key to any good relationship
is lying.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.584
-(scoffs)
-You tell her

27:07.667 --> 27:11.421
she's the only one you find attractive,
the only girl you want to sleep with,

27:11.504 --> 27:13.757
the only one you really want
to spend time with.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.760
All kinds of garbage
they can't possibly believe.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.928
Women count on us to lie to them.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.972
How else can they convince themselves

27:21.056 --> 27:23.683
that they still look young
if we don't help?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.144
Hello, Alan, Mr. Crane.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.146
Jerry, what brings you?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.523
I've reapplied for my old job.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.610
-I want to come back.
-What? Why?

27:34.152 --> 27:36.488
I miss it here.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.491
Mr. Crane, I was wondering
if we could speak.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.326
Call me Denny. No.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.702
JERRY: It would just take a minute.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.789
Shirley Schmidt has conditioned
my reentry on your opinion.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.540
I'll give it to you now. No.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.709
-Denny.
-He's too weird.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.545
-(purring)
-You see?

27:54.631 --> 27:56.341
We're off to court right now, Jerry.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.760
Denny will see you at 11:30.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.261
Thank you!

28:01.596 --> 28:05.058
-You disrespected me.
-You can see the man for five minutes.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.186
That isn't the point.
You overruled me in his presence.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.313
It's as if your friendship with him
means more than--

28:10.397 --> 28:12.982
Here we go. Denny, for God's sake...

28:18.571 --> 28:21.408
(sighs) Nobody knows
how to fight this war.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.870
It's like no other we've ever encountered.
The one thing that we do know is that

28:25.954 --> 28:28.415
we have to be extremely proactive
with our intelligence.

28:28.498 --> 28:31.167
It's the only way that we can prevent
another attack such as 9/11.

28:31.251 --> 28:34.337
That's why Guantanamo exists,
and it works.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.841
We've learned how bin Laden
has evaded capture.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.343
Now, we didn't get this stuff
by saying pretty please.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.095
Torture sometimes has to be used

28:42.178 --> 28:45.056
when you're talking about
saving the lives of the masses,

28:45.140 --> 28:47.308
both civilians at home
and soldiers abroad.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.686
Now, do innocent people
sometimes get captured?

28:49.769 --> 28:52.856
Yes. Mr. Kallah was evidently one.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.607
It was difficult to determine
that initially

28:54.691 --> 28:56.025
because he refused to cooperate.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.903
But, once it was so determined,
he was let go.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.573
The question here
is whether the government

29:01.656 --> 29:04.951
should be forced to stand trial
every time it makes a mistake.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.538
As Colonel Hegarty stated, that would
burden the war effort beyond measure.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.290
Not just financially but militarily.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.625
The... the discovery process alone

29:12.709 --> 29:14.836
would unearth information
that would aid the enemy.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.506
Come on, a little common sense here.
We're in a war, for God's sake.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.815
Your Honor, I believe a lawyer
should put his country before his client,

29:35.899 --> 29:37.776
and for that reason,
I'm gonna take the unusual step

29:37.859 --> 29:40.153
of asking you to dismiss
my client's lawsuit.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.031
-(scoffs) Objection. It's a trick.
-It's not a trick.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.201
Even though you argue, and I would agree,
that nobody knows how to fight this war,

29:46.284 --> 29:48.578
we should nevertheless defer
to the executive branch,

29:48.661 --> 29:50.997
who have indeed demonstrated
a particular expertise.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.373
I, for one, just can't wait to see
what they do next.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.876
Mr. Shore, I told you
I would not allow this case

29:54.959 --> 29:56.836
to become a political football.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.756
And I give you my word, Your Honor.
Not a single toss of the pigskin.

30:00.173 --> 30:03.301
And, by the way,
if one were to condemn Guantanamo,

30:03.384 --> 30:05.011
which I would never,
it certainly wouldn't be

30:05.094 --> 30:07.972
an indictment of just the administration
but of the entire Congress,

30:08.056 --> 30:09.891
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama included.

30:10.475 --> 30:15.063
Congress' silence can only be attributed
to consent, acquiescence, or disinterest.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.191
Take your pick. But it's at least safe
to say they don't much care.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.194
I should mention Joe Biden because he
wants people to know he's running too.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.362
Tell me why you care.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.783
I don't. I say dismiss. My client cares.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.368
But, come on, he's a whiner.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.412
So he got beat up a little,
duct taped, sexually violated.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.747
He never should've been over there

30:32.831 --> 30:34.791
offering humanitarian aid
in the first place.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.752
And then, what? He expects to be heard?
Get a trial, a lawyer?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.546
He wants the government to show evidence.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.131
We're in a war!
We need to make sacrifices!

30:45.552 --> 30:47.679
And we should start
with the little things, like human rights.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.181
I agree that the executive branch
has a particular expertise.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.516
In fact, I think they've been brilliant.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.352
Calling the prisoners
"enemy combatants" instead of prisoners,

30:54.435 --> 30:56.145
so we can end-run
the Geneva Convention and torture them.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.147
Brilliant! Basing the camp in Cuba

30:58.231 --> 31:00.608
so the Constitution
won't really get in our way. Brilliant.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.819
And under the Pentagon's
new draft guidelines--

31:02.902 --> 31:04.737
This is my favorite.
I'm sure it'll be yours.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.948
We'll have little tribunals in Guantanamo

31:07.031 --> 31:09.868
that'll allow suspects to be jailed
for life or even executed

31:09.951 --> 31:13.580
on evidence that would never be admissible
in civilian or military court.

31:13.663 --> 31:17.208
Imagine being able
to execute somebody on triple hearsay

31:17.292 --> 31:19.210
or on a totally coerced confession.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.628
-Brilliant.
-ATTORNEY: I object.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.796
If counsel doesn't want
to take this seriously--

31:21.880 --> 31:23.965
Why should I? Who does?

31:24.048 --> 31:26.217
The American public? The media?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.302
Who might give it mention,

31:27.385 --> 31:29.345
if only there weren't
so many starving actresses

31:29.429 --> 31:30.889
with drug problems to focus on.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.683
Congress?
Why should any of us take it seriously?

31:33.766 --> 31:36.561
We're torturing people.
We're holding them indefinitely.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.480
Many with no evidence,
giving them no trials, no lawyers.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.481
It's laughable.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.025
And then,
when they finally kill themselves,

31:42.108 --> 31:44.193
we call it
"manipulative, self-injurious behavior,

31:44.277 --> 31:46.946
an act of asymmetric warfare
waged against us."

31:47.030 --> 31:49.198
It's all very funny, very funny.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.285
Maybe the only reason
we aren't having a really good laugh

31:52.368 --> 31:55.288
is because the little GTMO tricks
have started popping up close to home.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.333
The recent revelations
of FBI abuses of the Patriot Act,

31:58.416 --> 32:00.001
all those bogus subpoenas

32:00.084 --> 32:02.503
and manufactured evidence
against American citizens.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.089
Maybe it's just ruined
some of the fun of GTMO.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.260
Oh, well. We're in a war!
We all need to lighten up a little.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.039
What are your intentions towards Alan?

32:38.665 --> 32:40.083
Denny, my friendship with Alan

32:40.166 --> 32:42.085
could not now
or ever be a threat to yours.

32:42.585 --> 32:45.129
Not to mention, I'm not going to do
anything to alienate you.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.590
You're senior patient-- Partner!

32:48.466 --> 32:50.093
(purring)

32:51.135 --> 32:55.139
Look, Shirley won't hire me
unless you okay it.

32:56.683 --> 32:57.725
(exhales)

32:59.185 --> 33:00.144
You still got the doll?

33:02.522 --> 33:03.523
Patty?

33:05.149 --> 33:06.776
I want to spend some time with her.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.529
-Forget it!
-I won't do anything untoward.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.115
Dinner? Maybe a movie?

33:13.157 --> 33:15.994
I give you my word, I will not touch her.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.121
No offense, but your word...

33:18.204 --> 33:20.498
I'll give you something of mine
that I hold dear.

33:23.001 --> 33:23.835
Please.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.130
Jerry, my new friend.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.217
One night.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.345
Welcome back to the team, son.

33:35.638 --> 33:36.472
Are you serious?

33:38.182 --> 33:39.809
-Truth is I've missed you.
-Oh!

33:40.601 --> 33:42.145
Thank you! (wheezes)

33:42.937 --> 33:45.189
Give me one of them little hops
on your way out.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.774
Thank you! Thank you!

33:46.858 --> 33:48.109
("'Til Your Fool Comes Home" playing)

33:48.192 --> 33:52.030
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

33:58.369 --> 34:00.079
FOLGER: They say, when people get scared,

34:00.163 --> 34:03.624
the first thing they'll give up
is their civil liberties.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.334
That's why, after 9/11,

34:05.418 --> 34:08.421
we were only too happy
to get frisked at airports.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.631
Some of us enjoyed it more than others.

34:11.507 --> 34:15.053
But when it gets to a point
where people are captured...

34:15.762 --> 34:16.804
then tortured...

34:17.430 --> 34:19.182
not because there is evidence,

34:19.265 --> 34:22.894
but rather,
just to see if there's evidence,

34:22.977 --> 34:26.814
when they are jailed in perpetuity,
afforded no trial,

34:26.898 --> 34:29.776
my God, the court has a duty to step in.

34:30.818 --> 34:33.362
The government's motion
to dismiss is denied.

34:34.405 --> 34:37.408
-(people chattering)
-(sighs) Oh, my.

34:40.995 --> 34:43.790
-Thank you, Mr. Shore.
-Thank you, Benyam.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.126
I wouldn't expect a jury to give you much.
I'd recommend settling.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.712
Not to mention,
this will probably be appealed.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.464
Yes, thank you so much.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.134
Uh, where's Mr. Crane?

34:57.678 --> 34:58.638
Oh, dear.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.431
Why are you here?

35:01.265 --> 35:03.226
I just wanted to salute your ruling.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.437
-Very ballsy.
-Thank you.

35:07.146 --> 35:07.980
You can go.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.566
-Anything else?
-No.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.237
-Nothing else at all?
-Nope.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.405
-Because if there is--
-Mr. Crane,

35:16.489 --> 35:17.740
please leave my chambers.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.035
Yes.

35:24.705 --> 35:25.540
Thank you.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.758
I forgot my briefcase.

35:38.886 --> 35:43.558
I just wanted to congratulate
you again on the ruling.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.226
Ballsy.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.644
Thank you.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.328
(elevator dings)

36:04.412 --> 36:08.708
So, Hands Espenson is officially back.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.419
I did a little checking.

36:11.502 --> 36:15.006
He's become an excellent litigator
and a solid citizen.

36:15.756 --> 36:16.674
We hope.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.805
Shirley, Paul, have a nice evening.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.274
-(knock on door)
-(door opens)

36:33.357 --> 36:34.734
Glor-- Oh.

36:34.817 --> 36:35.651
Alan.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.154
(chuckles)

36:40.031 --> 36:44.243
I'm new at this, uh, relationship game.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.371
And not so much new, I guess, as, uh...

36:47.455 --> 36:48.664
Rusty.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.667
Just so I'm clear.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.337
If I'm ever even...

36:55.296 --> 36:58.007
slightly attracted to another woman,

36:58.090 --> 36:59.675
I should just lie about that?

36:59.759 --> 37:02.094
-Through your teeth.
-Hmm.

37:03.930 --> 37:08.601
Really? Why would you tolerate
dishonesty from your partner?

37:08.684 --> 37:09.644
I wouldn't.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.897
If I ever catch you lying to me,
it's over.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.149
-Uh, but you just--
-No.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.193
It's very simple, Alan.

37:17.276 --> 37:20.988
When you tell me that you're not attracted
to anybody else but me...

37:22.448 --> 37:23.950
it needs to be the truth.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.427
I forgot how much they can befuddle you.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.763
Alan, would you listen to me
when it comes to women?

37:45.846 --> 37:48.266
-Can you do that, please?
-Why should I trust you?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.517
You're jealous of her.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.851
You'd be glad if it ended.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.146
-I'm not jealous of her anymore.
-You're jealous of Jerry.

37:54.230 --> 37:58.192
Well, women, I can compete against.
Other men...

37:59.193 --> 38:02.613
Let's face it.
You go for the soft, sensitive type.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.739
It's why I fell for you.

38:05.408 --> 38:09.996
Why are relationships with women
so much more complicated?

38:10.079 --> 38:12.123
Oh, women. Come on, Alan.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.542
Women have this hormone thing.

38:15.042 --> 38:20.089
Much as I love 'em, they're unstable,
which is why they can never be president.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.049
You don't think a woman
should ever be president?

38:22.133 --> 38:24.719
Oh, come on. Do you? In time of war?

38:24.802 --> 38:27.930
How would a woman handle a 9/11?
She'd cry.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.557
You think Hillary Clinton
would have cried?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.767
Well, uh, maybe not Hillary.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.936
-(chuckles)
-But she has a few chromosome issues.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.730
-Let's face it.
-What are you talking about?

38:35.813 --> 38:40.234
Alan, don't you ever look at her at times
and think, that's a guy?

38:40.318 --> 38:42.361
No, I find her...

38:42.445 --> 38:46.407
sexy in a "praying mantis
in a knee-length skirt" kind of way.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.992
You ever mentally undress her?

38:49.410 --> 38:51.954
(chuckling) I was talking
about my relationship issues.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.041
How did we get to mentally
undressing Hillary Clinton?

38:55.124 --> 38:58.252
-And so quickly, I might add.
-Because it's all related!

38:58.336 --> 38:59.920
I'm gonna tell you something
right here and now

39:00.004 --> 39:02.006
about women and a relationship.

39:02.089 --> 39:06.886
We would never be in Guantanamo
if it weren't for Hillary Clinton.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.974
I know the reason's obvious,
but give it to me just the same.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.231
Bill Clinton would never have lied
in the deposition.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.400
He wouldn't have risked impeachment.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.944
So, what if a sexual indiscretion
came to light?

39:24.028 --> 39:25.488
The public would have forgiven him.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.282
-But, Hillary...
-(scoffs)

39:28.366 --> 39:32.953
The reason he lied is because
he was afraid Hillary would find out.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.915
That's why he was impeached.
That's why Al Gore didn't win.

39:36.665 --> 39:39.168
And after all that
impeachment scandal crap,

39:39.251 --> 39:41.003
the public would've elected any fool...

39:41.087 --> 39:43.047
-(laughs)
-...other than a Democrat.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.174
-Cut to...
-(scoffs) George W.

39:45.257 --> 39:47.593
All because of a woman scorned.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.554
And... they're unstable.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.515
-All women?
-Every single one of 'em.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.433
-All shapes and sizes?
-Oh, the fat, the thin,

39:54.517 --> 39:55.726
the big, and the s...

39:59.063 --> 40:00.439
Oh, for God sakes.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.607
(exhales)

40:03.901 --> 40:05.444
All right, don't tell me.

40:05.778 --> 40:10.408
"Denny, I never want to see you again."

40:14.870 --> 40:16.122
(groans)

40:17.581 --> 40:20.042
The little ones are the most unstable.
Women.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.796
-Can't live with them.
-Can't take 'em quail hunting.

40:23.879 --> 40:24.922
Alan, you're best off with me.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.967
-I'm rock steady.
-Yes, you are.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.678
-Uncomplicated.
-Couldn't be simpler.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.846
Denny Crane.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.431
Denny Crane.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.559
(chuckles)

40:36.642 --> 40:38.310
(blues music plays)

40:53.117 --> 40:54.368
NARRATOR:<i> Next on</i> Boston Legal...

40:54.452 --> 40:56.954
Please do not tell me
that you've stolen the Stanley Cup.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.582
My name belongs on this cup.

40:59.665 --> 41:00.958
But you've never won it.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.793
DENNY:
I love it when the bride's knocked up.

41:02.877 --> 41:03.878
Everybody gossips.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.005
(yelling)

41:06.088 --> 41:07.756
-The head is coming!
-Oh, my God!

41:07.840 --> 41:10.301
You have about a half a minute
to tell me what's going on

41:10.384 --> 41:12.052
before those agents knock this door down.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.596
This is Maria and her son, Alberto.

41:13.679 --> 41:16.140
Maria's undocumented.
The church offered them sanctuary.

41:16.223 --> 41:18.976
This behavior will not be tolerated.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.394
I will fire you.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.562
There it is.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.984
(theme music playing)
