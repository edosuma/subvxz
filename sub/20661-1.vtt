02:49.878 --> 02:51.972
Liar!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.603
All Liar!

03:09.815 --> 03:11.863
Liar!

03:59.948 --> 04:01.541
What's going on?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.211
Courgette?

04:06.621 --> 04:09.591
Courgette, answer when mom calls!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.926
Hey, Courgette?

04:12.919 --> 04:13.920
Yes mom?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.680
Who is going to clean this up? Mummy?

04:16.839 --> 04:17.887
Courgette!

04:18.466 --> 04:19.935
This wasn't my intention.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.435
I'm sorry.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.268
What should I do with you?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.565
You'll regret this!

04:25.724 --> 04:28.068
Please don't, Mom!
This will hurt!

04:28.810 --> 04:30.312
No!

05:44.012 --> 05:50.082
MY LIFE AS A COURGETTE

05:57.182 --> 05:59.882
BRIGADE 3 - Reasons for engaging

06:02.445 --> 06:04.573
And how old are you, my boy?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.710
Nine.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.714
Was your mommy nice to you?

06:17.161 --> 06:18.261
Hm...yes.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.884
She drank a lot of beer.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.932
But her Potato fries were delicious,

06:23.028 --> 06:25.184
and sometimes we had fun.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.225
Yes.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.305
And sometimes not?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.817
All right. Where is your father?

06:33.101 --> 06:34.523
Here.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.696
And that's his chicken.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.451
Mom always said, he liked chickens very much.

06:47.866 --> 06:48.913
Good.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.391
I'll take you to a place

06:51.411 --> 06:53.268
where children like yourself,

06:53.288 --> 06:55.882
are without a daddy and a mommy.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.965
But I have a mom.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.471
Your mom is no longer there, Icare.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.803
My name is Courgette!

07:04.507 --> 07:05.850
Courgette...

07:06.718 --> 07:08.846
Did your mom call you that?

07:08.946 --> 07:09.946
Hm.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.360
My name is Raymond.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.613
Did your mom call you that?

07:18.713 --> 07:19.813
Yes.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.170
Shall we let your kite fly high?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.152
Come along, my boy.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.243
Good morning, Monsieur.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.076
Good morning, Madam Director.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.874
This is Icare.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.837
But he rather call him, Courgette.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.755
Courgette?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.337
That's what his mother called him,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.339
so it's important for him.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.055
Right, my little one, come on.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.596
Welcome to "The Fountains".

09:15.638 --> 09:17.231
Courgette.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.859
Don't worry...here you go.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.532
I'll come to see you.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.164
Goodbye, Madame.
Goodbye, Monsieur.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.597
Are you coming?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.103
Rosy will show you, your room.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.210
COURGETTE

10:02.310 --> 10:05.689
The big drawer is where you can put your things.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.065
Look here.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.781
I'll let you know. This is your bed.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.323
Is everything OK?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.580
Put your things. I'm waiting in the hallway.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.376
Good morning, Madame!

11:00.910 --> 11:04.915
Children, this is your new classmate:Icare.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.340
Courgette.
Oh, excuse me.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.590
Your new classmate:Courgette.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.976
Probably like Potatoes, at the Visage!
Quite, Simon!

11:18.261 --> 11:20.434
Quite, quite children!

11:21.347 --> 11:24.066
Thank you.
Well, I'll leave now.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.647
See you later, Monsieur Paul.
See you later.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.782
Sit down, my boy.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.654
Go on.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.874
The cow is a ruminant.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.419
This means that it ruminates.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.672
It eats the grass for the first time,

11:45.830 --> 11:52.128
but without chewing it.
Then it chokes it up and chews in peace.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.514
We don't know exactly, why the cow...

11:56.257 --> 11:58.656
Welcome to prison, Potato!

11:58.676 --> 12:01.475
Potatoes sit on hot coal!

12:19.322 --> 12:22.792
There's still a lot many pores in him
after so much drilling!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.329
Let me be, Simon!

12:28.331 --> 12:30.049
Get another chair!

12:32.210 --> 12:34.429
Why, Potato, why are you here?

12:34.712 --> 12:35.554
Huh?

12:35.797 --> 12:36.764
Come on! Tell me!

12:37.340 --> 12:38.808
Why were you brought here?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.053
Wait a moment! Those are Potatoes on your plate!

12:42.345 --> 12:43.688
Potato eats Potatoes!

12:44.347 --> 12:47.567
Isn't that bizarre? Potato is a cannibal.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.319
It's enough, Simon!

12:50.561 --> 12:54.486
Your parents threw you out. They wanted to get rid of you.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.861
A rotten Potato!

12:58.403 --> 12:59.325
Off the compost!

12:59.654 --> 13:00.621
Stop it!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.248
Keep your mouth shut!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.626
Look, Alice is on the vibration alarm.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.849
You and your plaster!

13:06.869 --> 13:09.122
That was Rosy. I had a headache.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.633
You're annoying with your fork!

13:16.754 --> 13:18.722
I'm getting out, why you are here?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.433
I'll get me out!

13:25.513 --> 13:26.935
Another autist!

13:40.945 --> 13:42.663
Time to sleep!

13:42.905 --> 13:44.782
Everyone get in the dorm!

13:44.949 --> 13:47.122
Good night, guys. Beautiful dreams!

13:47.285 --> 13:49.162
Go to bed right now!

13:51.414 --> 13:53.291
Courgette is already asleep.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.010
Ahmed, did you pee?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.505
Uh...I believe so.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.595
Do you believe so or did you?
I believe so.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.635
You're really crass, man!

14:03.801 --> 14:05.644
Yeah, you're really crass, man!

14:05.803 --> 14:08.898
Ahmed, the girl who wets her bed!
Quite!

14:09.182 --> 14:10.604
Come on!
He has hew me.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.776
Kisses to all and light off!

14:27.325 --> 14:29.419
Good night!
Thank you.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.422
Until tomorrow.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.555
Is Potato asleep?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.318
No, Potato isn't sleeping.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.106
Nor will his eye.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.981
The kite's really high!

15:32.348 --> 15:34.726
Let it go, please!

15:35.643 --> 15:37.611
Did you see how it flies?

15:38.312 --> 15:40.155
Hey! Let go!

15:40.314 --> 15:43.172
Oh yeah? And what else are you doing?

15:43.192 --> 15:46.162
And did you get your magic wand out, Harry Potato?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.414
Harry Potato? Such nonsense!

15:48.698 --> 15:51.247
Brawl, brawl!

15:51.451 --> 15:53.141
Do it all!

15:53.161 --> 15:54.788
Kung-Fu-Courgette!

15:54.954 --> 15:57.298
Never touch my kite again, am I clear?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.007
No, that's not clear.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.650
Do that once again, and I'll break your arm!

16:02.670 --> 16:04.152
Courgette has muscles!

16:04.172 --> 16:06.641
He's crazy! His types are really strong.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.020
We were playing soccer, he came from behind...

16:11.179 --> 16:12.396
and he tackled me.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.026
Courgette? Won't you saying anything?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.574
I want to go home to my mom.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.908
Please wait outside, Simon.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.301
That cannot be done, Courgette.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.011
Your mom is gone, she's in heaven.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.140
But here you will be fine.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.519
I promise you.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.609
Hey, Potato!?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.748
Courgette?

17:17.494 --> 17:19.497
My parents were on drugs.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.215
Both of them.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.174
The whole time.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.847
That's why I'm here.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.602
Tell me why you're here?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.109
I know all about it.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.441
I know it files through the heart.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.658
Do you see Bea? Her mother was expelled,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.536
to Africa, when Bea was at school.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.662
Jujube's mother keeps the fridge on.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.922
Click klack, Click klack...all the time.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.924
Or she is cleaning the toilet for weeks.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.482
She is a total lunatic.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.381
Come on, I'm here. Shoot!

18:09.630 --> 18:12.133
Ahmed's father got caught in a holdup.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.100
Do you believe that?

18:16.304 --> 18:19.023
In a gas station, to get him a Nike!

18:19.390 --> 18:21.017
Shall I call Rosy?

18:21.309 --> 18:25.439
Alice's father did nasty things, disgusting stuff.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.565
Don't know exactly what.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.407
Alice has nightmares every night.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.915
But, now he is in prison.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.045
I think, I killed my mom.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.517
But I didn't want that.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.810
Wasn't my intention.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.560
We are all the same.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.730
There's no one who loves us.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.972
So...in the morning we get up.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.726
And then Ahmed takes his time to pee.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.854
Then we wash ourselves.

19:42.139 --> 19:46.861
Except Simon. He always pretends to take a shower.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.907
And Jujube eats the toothpaste.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.902
His mother said, that it was healthy.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.867
There, the orangutan.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.414
The Gorilla.

19:58.510 --> 19:59.233
The Chimpanzee.

19:59.323 --> 20:03.419
Mr.Paul teaches us about people,
who were there before us.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.922
They lived, when there was no soap.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.958
They never showered.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.135
Like Simon!

20:11.502 --> 20:12.378
Monsieur!

20:12.795 --> 20:16.766
And then Jujube asks,
whether he could go to the first-aid room,

20:17.425 --> 20:18.768
because of the toothpaste.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.655
In the play time we play "Cro-Magnon People".

20:37.695 --> 20:40.574
Good. Excellent. Seems funny.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.666
Yes, it's funny.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.295
What is it, my boy?

20:52.585 --> 20:55.179
It wouldn't be so funny, hadn't you visit.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.932
You think I come here because I have to?

20:59.717 --> 21:01.449
Don't know, this is your job.

21:01.469 --> 21:05.895
No, this is not my job. I come here because I like you.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.650
I like you too.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.173
Oh! Hey!?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.241
They don't like policemen.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.613
Ahmed believes, you put his father in prison.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.334
Good morning, Madame!

21:25.910 --> 21:27.503
Mum!

21:27.661 --> 21:29.334
What does she want from me?

21:39.256 --> 21:40.974
Come on, wake up!

21:42.009 --> 21:43.852
Come on, I've got to go.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.558
Well...

21:45.971 --> 21:48.224
She sure is a rough brush!

21:51.024 --> 21:52.104
Oh! No!

22:13.332 --> 22:15.255
She will be safe in her room.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.514
My poor little treasure!

22:21.298 --> 22:22.766
It's hard, very hard!

22:23.551 --> 22:25.019
No, she's not here?

22:30.057 --> 22:32.151
Then she is safe in the yard.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.695
My name is Camille.
(My name is Courgette)

22:45.489 --> 22:46.911
My name is Courgette.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.421
Hey, newbie, tell me, why you are here?

22:57.585 --> 23:00.429
Are you the boss here?
Exactly.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.887
So everyone must obey you?
Yes. That's right...

23:04.466 --> 23:06.389
so that you can talk to girls.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.187
Good.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.538
I'm here...

23:12.558 --> 23:13.935
because of my mother.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.648
Every morning...

23:16.437 --> 23:17.905
I had to...

23:18.522 --> 23:21.366
dress like a dinosaur to go to school.

23:21.609 --> 23:22.485
Really?

23:24.153 --> 23:25.826
Hey, what's this nonsense?

23:26.238 --> 23:28.115
Watch out, don't laugh.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.673
I like dinosaurs very much.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.588
You are spastic!

23:43.380 --> 23:45.474
Bye, boss!

24:02.316 --> 24:04.785
Simon!
What is it, Sparrow?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.787
Can I ask you something?

24:07.029 --> 24:09.999
Do you know how things go?
What things?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.284
The thing with boys and girls...

24:13.077 --> 24:15.671
I know by heart, my parents had movies.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.923
It was quite devious.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.380
You move like this...

24:20.542 --> 24:23.386
and the girl also moves, and then...

24:23.545 --> 24:26.640
Bang!
As in? He explodes?

24:27.424 --> 24:30.598
Exactly, he explodes.
No! Seriously, Simon!

24:31.053 --> 24:33.727
I mean, you're totally intrigued.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.730
Man, I'm tired!
And the girl?

24:36.934 --> 24:39.904
She sweats totally and says, she agrees.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.073
She says, "Oh yes, yes, yes...", like that.

24:44.233 --> 24:44.825
Ah!

24:46.110 --> 24:47.828
How come you aren't saying anything, Courgette?

24:48.946 --> 24:49.913
Courgette?

24:50.197 --> 24:52.575
He has a crush, that's why.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.336
Really? Do you have a crush?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.330
That's just bull!

24:57.579 --> 25:01.254
You look miles on miles,
that you've a crush on Camille.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.929
I would just like to know, why she is here.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.140
Well, that's because of the thing with dinosaurs.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.064
I know why she is here.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.900
Do you really want to know?

25:25.149 --> 25:27.618
Are you sure?
Shh!

25:33.407 --> 25:36.206
And what if we get caught?
Do you want to know or not?

25:36.410 --> 25:37.252
Yes.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.962
Here, stop.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.182
I have it!

25:58.515 --> 26:00.358
Interesting.

26:01.769 --> 26:04.739
So...she killed a guy.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.657
Because he was in love with her.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.112
What?

26:09.068 --> 26:11.116
If I were you, I'd be careful.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.532
She has a problem with guys with vegetable seeds.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.621
The guy was called "A Carrot".

26:17.159 --> 26:19.787
Stop it!
Are you scared, huh?

26:21.830 --> 26:25.505
In real, her father killed her mother.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.879
Because she loved someone else.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.719
And then...

26:31.381 --> 26:34.009
He killed himself.
Show me.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.519
Camille saw it all.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.272
Here, look.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.393
Yes, that's right.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.861
It can be seen in her eyes,

26:45.854 --> 26:47.447
that she saw everything.

27:04.947 --> 27:10.447
CHILDREN'S WEATHER
Simon - Alice - Ahmed - Jujube - Bea - Courgette - Camille

27:10.547 --> 27:12.447
Camille? Camille?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.314
Jujube, look!

27:24.059 --> 27:25.982
This is called preparation.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.002
If Rosy and Monsieur Paul were in bed,

27:29.022 --> 27:33.619
she would sweat ten times more, and he would explode.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.496
Is that right, Simon?
That's right.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.704
Disgusting!
No, he's just in love.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.836
He presses her tightly, so that she doesn't run away.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.246
Oh yes!

27:44.872 --> 27:47.421
Children, ready for the first snow?

27:47.624 --> 27:49.592
Monsieur!
Yes, Ahmed.

27:49.751 --> 27:53.847
I have a question. Are you still healthy?

27:54.631 --> 27:55.848
What are you talking about?

27:56.133 --> 27:59.854
If he explodes, we didn't come for the snow.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.252
What's this? Tell me, Potato!

28:23.410 --> 28:25.162
Don't touch that!
He's an Alki!

28:25.454 --> 28:28.173
Give it back! That's my mom's keepsake.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.880
Don't touch that!
Calm down.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.788
Quite cold out here!

29:04.076 --> 29:05.919
Who is thirsty?
I am! I am! I am!

29:07.621 --> 29:09.089
Be good, alright?

29:13.210 --> 29:15.429
Your glasses are really cool!

29:16.588 --> 29:18.056
I even see myself in them.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.013
Did you want to try these on?
Yes!

29:22.719 --> 29:25.268
Wow! That's lovely!

29:25.472 --> 29:27.315
Why did you do that?

29:27.474 --> 29:28.691
Little thief!

29:29.101 --> 29:30.193
Where is your mother?

29:30.477 --> 29:33.071
Gone, with a man. She'll never see me again.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.107
And your father?
In prison.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.735
A thief and a liar!

29:39.403 --> 29:42.452
No, I'm not lying. Not lying Madame.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.991
Come on sweetheart. Let's go.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.379
I am not a liar. I don't lie!

29:53.834 --> 29:55.711
Come on!

30:20.819 --> 30:22.287
Cool!

30:22.446 --> 30:23.868
Watch out!

30:24.072 --> 30:26.541
We are faster than you.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.765
Look!

30:45.677 --> 30:47.784
His mummy is pretty.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.772
Maybe that's not his mom.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.012
(EISBAR BY GRAUZONE)

31:17.112 --> 31:18.212
* Ice bear *

31:21.812 --> 31:32.012
* I want to be a polar bear, in the cold polar *
* Then I would no longer scream *

31:32.812 --> 31:34.512
* Everything was so clear *

31:36.182 --> 31:45.912
* I want to be a polar bear, in the cold polar *
* Then I would no longer scream *

31:47.812 --> 31:48.912
* Everything was so clear *

32:23.775 --> 32:26.654
Hey, are you asleep?

32:29.573 --> 32:30.995
No.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.912
And you? Are you asleep?

32:36.580 --> 32:38.503
Neither am I.

32:42.752 --> 32:43.969
And you?

32:46.047 --> 32:47.890
Still haven't.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.523
Shh! Come on over!

33:04.858 --> 33:08.078
I have something for you. For your birthday.

33:08.236 --> 33:12.833
I had my birthday already.
Three months back we didn't know each other.

33:15.118 --> 33:18.543
I couldn't give you anything. Here.

33:23.103 --> 33:24.143
Wow!

33:32.427 --> 33:35.306
How did you know, when was my birthday?

33:36.181 --> 33:39.060
I went through Madame Papineau's office.

33:42.479 --> 33:45.449
Then you know everything.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.327
Uh...yeah.

33:50.278 --> 33:54.749
When my parents passed on,
I went over to my aunt's.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.503
She brought me here the other day.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.086
She is a nasty witch.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.093
When we were alone, she would cry on a stretch.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.975
Now...in here, the home it's good.

34:15.762 --> 34:20.063
Sometimes I dream it were still great
and I live with my mom.

34:21.351 --> 34:24.480
She still talks to herself and drinks beer.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.532
And I too, drink a lot.

34:29.150 --> 34:33.030
Fortunately, that this will never happen.

34:36.658 --> 34:40.288
Had I not come here, I would have never known you.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.022
Where had you been?

35:00.265 --> 35:02.393
Did you explode?

35:02.642 --> 35:05.834
We were in the snow, as we leave tomorrow.

35:05.854 --> 35:09.449
I don't want to go back! The snow was in my dream.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.201
That and the sledge.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.913
You lot! Let's snowball!
Girls versus boys!

35:18.052 --> 35:19.152
Watch out!

35:20.952 --> 35:22.670
We have no more ammunition.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.877
Hello, Raymond, I'm fine.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.710
Something great happened.

36:05.914 --> 36:10.090
Here, Ahmed, gently lay your hand on it,
then you can feel it.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.461
Rosy is expecting.

36:11.628 --> 36:12.925
Do you feel it?
Yes.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.466
That was Monsieur Pauls Pimmel's doing, I believe.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.725
We thought she went away.

36:19.636 --> 36:22.105
But she says, it would be our little brother.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.312
We will call him Spiderman.

36:25.102 --> 36:26.882
Spiderman! Spiderman! Spiderman...

36:27.227 --> 36:29.400
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.658
Oh, yes! I wanted to tell you something else...

36:33.942 --> 36:36.411
The new girl is called Camille.

36:37.821 --> 36:44.847
362, 363, 364, 365, 366...

36:44.953 --> 36:48.548
What is your record?
My record is 747.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.880
You're good.
My goal is 1000.

36:51.167 --> 36:55.343
I read the world record was 27,075.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.517
That girl jumped for 13 hours.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.394
Really? Not bad.

37:02.554 --> 37:07.708
347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352...

37:07.809 --> 37:09.811
3, 2, 1.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.565
Mum!

37:19.487 --> 37:21.535
What does she want here?

37:25.869 --> 37:27.667
Camille?

37:27.954 --> 37:31.424
I don't understand.
She refuses to see you.

37:31.524 --> 37:32.524
What!?

37:42.927 --> 37:45.535
I saw you, Spastic!
What are you doing?

37:45.555 --> 37:46.772
Nothing.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.691
What is in that letter?

37:49.476 --> 37:51.399
A letter from my mom.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.105
Open it up.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.615
I like to open letters, give it to me.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.999
Wow! An MP3 player!
You're so lucky!

38:04.282 --> 38:06.455
Is there a letter?
No.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.212
I'm sorry.

38:14.751 --> 38:15.673
Did she say that?

38:15.960 --> 38:18.088
Unfortunately...it's the shock.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.928
She wants her poor mother.
Don't betray...

38:21.257 --> 38:24.852
Yes. This tragedy was a terrible shock.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.353
Have patience.

38:26.596 --> 38:31.102
I will leave her here for as long as necessary,
until she crawls up to me.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.650
After the weekend then.
Hm.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.401
That's mean! Disgusting!

38:41.569 --> 38:42.786
Come on.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.283
What's wrong with you?

38:46.533 --> 38:50.037
We saw Camille's aunt. She is really nasty!

38:51.329 --> 38:54.503
Poor Camille! I don't want her to live with such a thing.

38:55.041 --> 38:59.262
Luckily she doesn't have to go.
But! Madame Papineau said...

39:00.547 --> 39:01.890
What?

39:18.356 --> 39:21.155
But...I don't understand.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.784
Why does she want you to live with you,
if you don't like her?

39:25.363 --> 39:28.913
Because of the money.
When I live with her, she gets a lot of money.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.714
If I am there, I'll kill myself.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.549
Or I'll kill her.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.556
I will not let you go.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.068
Mum!

40:00.398 --> 40:02.071
Are you ready? Are we going?

40:04.861 --> 40:07.364
I'm sorry...Yes. Yes. They don't like policemen.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.493
Wait here. I'll tell Madame Papineau about this.

40:18.583 --> 40:22.087
This is heavy!
Really heavy!

40:22.378 --> 40:23.675
Hurry up!

40:24.380 --> 40:27.429
Next time I'm spanking that kid!

40:32.263 --> 40:34.357
Your bag is huge.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.352
Here we go!

40:49.948 --> 40:52.167
Well, do you have anything to say?

40:53.076 --> 40:56.546
Like, about the girl, you had written...

40:56.704 --> 40:57.796
How is she like?

40:58.456 --> 40:59.378
Not bad.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.217
No more...?

41:01.417 --> 41:03.465
In your letter you did sound enthusiastic,

41:03.628 --> 41:05.130
her hair...

41:05.672 --> 41:07.640
her hair is soft,

41:07.924 --> 41:09.767
long...

41:10.301 --> 41:13.020
And she has eyes, the stomachache.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.102
What color are they?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.525
What is this circus?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.904
I wanted to take her with me.
Then you should have said so!

41:21.187 --> 41:22.188
Her aunt does not want her!

41:22.480 --> 41:24.903
We must turn around.
No!

41:25.108 --> 41:28.032
If I go back to my aunt, she would hit me.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.535
OK! OK!

41:32.323 --> 41:34.451
I still need to call the home.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.838
Yes?

41:39.372 --> 41:41.170
Yeah, well.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.794
Yes, Monsieur, good.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.009
I'll talk to her aunt.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.193
Are you alright, Courgette?

42:05.773 --> 42:07.491
I used to live there.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.487
Do you want to go?

42:46.064 --> 42:47.532
What is it?

42:51.402 --> 42:53.871
That is when my mother measured my height.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.658
That was when I was standing.

42:57.450 --> 43:00.044
That is when my father left.

43:00.787 --> 43:03.666
And that...I don't know any more.

43:05.249 --> 43:08.002
In any case you have grown beautifully.

43:13.802 --> 43:14.922
GHOST TRAIN

43:24.435 --> 43:26.062
Be careful, Raymond!

43:26.687 --> 43:28.314
Caution, head down!

43:42.620 --> 43:44.588
I'd be a bad cowboy.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.629
Give it to me.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.547
Wow! You are so cool!

43:52.839 --> 43:56.560
We had a gun at home.
Like in the Western?

43:57.844 --> 44:00.267
My father taught me how to shoot.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.066
He was...

44:06.185 --> 44:07.232
and...

44:08.521 --> 44:09.989
Yes, I know.

44:11.274 --> 44:15.620
We'd like to get the biggest teddy, Madame.

44:21.033 --> 44:24.879
Pretty, your children!
These are not my...

44:25.788 --> 44:27.085
Thank you.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.679
She left with Courgette.
Courgette?

44:37.216 --> 44:39.093
With Icare and a policeman.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.353
A courgette, a policeman? Why is that?

44:41.512 --> 44:44.732
She was hiding...A policeman who steals children!

44:45.016 --> 44:46.734
A great man!

44:47.018 --> 44:50.397
She was hiding in the car. He did not know.

44:50.897 --> 44:54.172
She did not want to spend the weekend with you.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.536
But she must spend the weekend with me!

44:56.819 --> 44:58.759
Where does this man live?
Be reasonable, madam.

44:58.779 --> 45:00.156
It's Camille's will.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.284
Since when do children have a will?

45:03.534 --> 45:04.877
I'll get her off him.

45:08.956 --> 45:11.004
Madam, excuse me! Excuse me.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.969
Could you please give this to Camille?

45:14.253 --> 45:15.470
What is this supposed to be?

45:16.130 --> 45:17.757
Eh... her lucky charm.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.350
She forgot.

45:23.179 --> 45:26.149
Ah, your fortune-teller! Of course!

45:30.049 --> 45:31.149
Yes!

45:35.858 --> 45:37.781
Is that you when you were young?

45:38.236 --> 45:41.331
No, this is my son.
You have a son?

45:41.739 --> 45:45.289
Yes, but he lives far away. I can't see him anymore.

45:47.495 --> 45:50.715
Sometimes the children leave their parents.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.256
Shall we continue the tour?

45:58.866 --> 45:59.866
Wow!

45:59.966 --> 46:03.561
This is a jungle!
I love to grow things.

46:10.726 --> 46:12.478
Are we sleeping here?

46:14.272 --> 46:16.240
Is that right?
Yes!

46:31.539 --> 46:34.088
Stop it!

46:41.257 --> 46:44.306
You know, on the bus...

46:46.220 --> 46:48.814
I hadn't slept.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.409
You are not in bed!

47:08.576 --> 47:10.544
And Ferkeleien will do it!

47:10.828 --> 47:13.172
Come on, baby, off we go home!

47:13.706 --> 47:15.504
A kidnapper boy, incredible!

47:15.791 --> 47:16.758
Let me go!

47:17.168 --> 47:19.525
Let her go, madam!
I'll report this.

47:19.545 --> 47:22.594
Camille did not want to see you. She has her reasons.

47:22.798 --> 47:26.268
I will report this!
She's coming with me!

47:26.552 --> 47:28.350
The judge will set you right.

48:06.842 --> 48:10.813
That wasn't a good idea. I am hallucinating.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.815
The French fries talked to me.

48:13.224 --> 48:17.855
And what does it say to you?
It said, "Eat me, eat me, fatso!"

48:18.145 --> 48:19.613
What's going on here?

48:20.022 --> 48:21.365
Didn't you eat?

48:21.524 --> 48:22.571
Don't you like the taste?

48:24.276 --> 48:27.371
We'll be on a hunger strike, until Camille returns.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.741
She will come back.

48:30.616 --> 48:34.746
The judge will decide,
whether her aunt may keep her or not.

48:45.005 --> 48:45.972
Dear Camille,

48:46.382 --> 48:49.101
Since you left, it's no longer funny.

48:49.635 --> 48:53.356
Our hunger strike was a riot.

48:54.765 --> 48:57.609
Beatrice's mother came by.

49:03.315 --> 49:04.988
Bea escaped with Rosy.

49:06.193 --> 49:07.410
I want to stay with you.

49:08.279 --> 49:11.032
And Ahmed has gone back to bed.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.387
What...

49:33.179 --> 49:35.273
1.2. 1.2.

49:35.931 --> 49:39.902
This is Simon. If you hear me, raise your arm.

49:40.102 --> 49:42.446
No, the other one.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.690
I'm sorry, that's a silly joke.

49:45.357 --> 49:47.576
Now that everything is so bad.

49:48.486 --> 49:51.330
Listen carefully.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.589
You're a witch just like your mother.

50:01.081 --> 50:03.550
Your nonsense is very convenient for me...Camille!

50:03.959 --> 50:05.927
for the Judge to like.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.264
You dug your own grave, dummy.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.988
Mr.Richter, I care for an excellent education,

50:25.272 --> 50:28.993
A healthy environment, comfort and above all, love.

50:29.777 --> 50:32.075
I love her like my own daughter.
Hm...mm.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.625
We understand each other, right?

50:38.160 --> 50:40.583
She doesn't seem very enthusiastic.

50:40.746 --> 50:44.216
That is understandable, after the trauma experienced...

50:44.500 --> 50:47.094
She certainly has the will to leave her mother.

50:50.506 --> 50:55.854
Camille, what do you say?
Would you like to go to your aunt?

50:56.262 --> 50:58.060
You will admit, after this incident

50:58.347 --> 51:00.224
I am rightly concerned, about her safety.

51:01.141 --> 51:04.270
Here, where ever anything goes under and over.

51:05.396 --> 51:07.524
You're a witch like your mother.

51:07.773 --> 51:09.775
With tear out, be ashamed!

51:10.067 --> 51:11.535
There is chaos in the home.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.537
This will not please the judge.

51:13.779 --> 51:14.530
Give it to me!

51:14.905 --> 51:16.657
Stop, stop!

51:17.283 --> 51:19.661
You dug your own grave, dummy.

51:33.382 --> 51:36.135
What are you dressed up like, Alice?
A pirate.

51:36.885 --> 51:39.388
And you?
A mummy.

51:39.930 --> 51:42.854
And you, Beatrice?
As Camille.

51:43.142 --> 51:46.066
What do you have for magic? Do you make vegetables to grow?

51:46.353 --> 51:49.086
What are you dressed like?
A Spastic?

51:49.106 --> 51:51.154
To be clear...who saved you?

51:51.734 --> 51:53.577
And he is disguised as a bull.

51:53.736 --> 51:55.909
For starters, I still don't like it.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.331
But I'll keep the cap.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.644
When are you coming back?
Soon.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.688
How soon?

52:22.973 --> 52:26.318
You know, I have spoken to the judge.

52:27.645 --> 52:31.115
I would like to be your host family.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.902
For you and Camille.

52:34.401 --> 52:37.200
Does that mean we're your guests?
Yes.

52:37.863 --> 52:41.367
And you will be like our family,
even though you are alone?

52:41.533 --> 52:42.250
Yes, I will.

52:42.785 --> 52:45.880
You get to go to my house.

52:46.038 --> 52:48.086
It will be your home.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.084
If you want to.

52:51.251 --> 52:55.472
Does Camille know?
Yes, the judge has spoken to her.

52:57.883 --> 53:00.557
What did she say?

53:01.261 --> 53:04.811
I don't know. Consider it between you both.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.313
You and Camille. Huh?

53:08.060 --> 53:10.859
That's it. See you soon, my boy.

53:12.189 --> 53:13.862
See you soon, Raymond!

53:33.168 --> 53:36.638
I wish to thank all. You saved my life.

53:37.047 --> 53:40.392
Especially Simon. Thank you.

53:41.677 --> 53:43.771
I would not have thought,

53:44.555 --> 53:48.901
that life could be so cool.
With you it's really cool here.

53:49.059 --> 53:52.029
We stay together all our lives!
Cool!

53:52.229 --> 53:54.903
No, it's not true. We can't stay together.

53:55.107 --> 53:58.452
Camille and Courgette are leaving. And the bull too!

54:10.792 --> 54:13.892

* Hi you the Tunisian *

54:13.992 --> 54:17.992
* Hey you Bangladesh *
* Hey you Greek people *

54:18.092 --> 54:21.617
* Hey you Chilean *
* Hey you the Malian p'tit *

54:21.717 --> 54:23.685
Hey, Simon!

54:26.346 --> 54:28.189
Simon...

54:30.100 --> 54:32.478
We're not leaving, Simon.

54:33.145 --> 54:35.694
We want to stay here.

54:37.399 --> 54:41.370
It would be unjust if we left.
It's nice here, all together.

54:43.155 --> 54:45.249
Simon...

54:51.163 --> 54:53.336
You must get away.

54:59.505 --> 55:03.931
It's rare someone adopts such great children like us.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.605
You must get away for us.

55:12.351 --> 55:14.149
Do you understand?

55:25.322 --> 55:28.292
A bull and a superhero hug each other!

55:28.450 --> 55:30.293
Is already crass, right?

55:33.956 --> 55:36.630
Simon, a bit further to the left!

55:37.125 --> 55:38.251
OK then.

55:39.795 --> 55:41.513
Don't move!

55:43.423 --> 55:45.721
Stop the nonsense!

55:47.928 --> 55:50.147
This is a real photo!

55:50.556 --> 55:53.901
Attention! Smile!

55:54.768 --> 55:57.692
Yes!

56:39.855 --> 56:42.825
So then, you already off, Super-Courgette?

56:48.030 --> 56:50.499
Goodbye!

57:04.630 --> 57:07.474
We're racing. Whoever comes last,

57:07.841 --> 57:10.185
washes my underpants till the end of his life.

57:10.285 --> 57:11.385
Alright! Go.

57:38.330 --> 57:41.755
This is the day with you, My children.

57:53.428 --> 57:55.146
Do you like it?

58:18.370 --> 58:21.169
You alright, Camille?
Yes.

58:21.456 --> 58:24.300
I don't know why I'm crying.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.634
Sometimes one cries because one is glad.

58:29.715 --> 58:31.638
Right, Raymond?

58:32.467 --> 58:34.060
Yes...

58:45.897 --> 58:47.240
Dear Simon,

58:47.524 --> 58:51.700
You said, Home is for the them,
who have no one to love.

58:53.905 --> 58:57.000
You were wrong. We haven't forgotten you.

58:58.660 --> 59:00.628
And others won't.

59:21.391 --> 59:23.393
He opened his eyes.

59:23.685 --> 59:25.779
He doesn't want to let go.

59:25.937 --> 59:28.110
What's his name?
Antoine.

59:28.273 --> 59:31.402
Nice name.
Spiderman would've been better.

59:31.568 --> 59:33.741
Will he stay here with us?

59:34.154 --> 59:35.280
No.

59:35.572 --> 59:38.166
Except, if you put him out.
Certainly not!

59:38.325 --> 59:40.748
Even if he is ugly?

59:40.952 --> 59:42.545
Even if he smells of poop?

59:42.704 --> 59:43.921
Even if he cries all the time?

59:44.289 --> 59:47.022
Even if he goes to bed?
Or cry lousy tunes?

59:47.042 --> 59:49.636
Even if he's stupid?
Or eat like a piglet?

59:49.795 --> 59:52.514
Even if he forgets his name and his feet stink?

59:53.381 --> 59:56.385
Even if he is unbearable
and constantly screaming?

59:56.676 --> 59:58.144
Even if he farts?

59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.602
Even if he scribbles on the walls?
Or wants to be goto Africa?

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:06.278
Even if...Even if he has a giraffe neck?

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.189
Even if he is punk?
