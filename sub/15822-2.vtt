00:12.500 --> 00:14.100
good morning.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.360
you know...

01:03.430 --> 01:05.400
we haven't spent any quality time

01:05.430 --> 01:06.630
in the guest room yet.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.930
really?

01:35.030 --> 01:36.030
oh! oh! oh!are you okay?

01:36.060 --> 01:37.430
i'm fine.just a back spasm.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.600
-are you okay?  -i'm fine. i'm fine.

01:38.930 --> 01:39.660
old football injury.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
shoot!

01:42.030 --> 01:43.700
i'll just let voicemail get it.

01:43.730 --> 01:46.500
no, i'm fine. please.go answer. you're vibrating.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.460
well...i was.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.300
hello?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.930
gabriel said it's a hit-and-run,

01:54.960 --> 01:57.030
so it should be an easy day.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.260
yes?

02:04.300 --> 02:06.960
maybe...we could meet back in the guest room --

02:07.030 --> 02:08.360
say around noon?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.800
noon?are you sure?

02:10.830 --> 02:11.960
oh, i'll be ready.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.260
i told you it's just a muscle spasm.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.730
really?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.900
do not doubt the fbi.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.100
i won't.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.660
working out some kinks,you know?

02:42.700 --> 02:45.100
yeah,it's a little rough.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.460
morning, sergeant.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.860
commander.hey.

02:48.900 --> 02:49.860
nice tie.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.100
thanks.

02:54.060 --> 02:56.730
good morning.oh, what a lovely day.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.730
is she all right?

02:58.760 --> 03:01.630
so, why are we here?

03:01.740 --> 03:04.840
uh, chief, at 6:10 this morning,a shop owner found

03:04.880 --> 03:06.980
what he described as a "dead homeless dude"

03:07.010 --> 03:08.840
in the alley behind his building.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.210
so, now priority homicide is handling "homeless dudes"?

03:12.240 --> 03:14.410
well, technically,he's not homeless.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.210
responding officers found a parole i.d. in his wallet

03:17.240 --> 03:20.240
saying he lives at a halfway house in north hollywood

03:20.280 --> 03:23.280
and that his name is roy wilkinson.

03:23.310 --> 03:24.580
they called me,

03:24.610 --> 03:28.740
and i thought it best to get priority involved.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.580
what is that smell?

03:31.610 --> 03:32.640
margaritas.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.210
one is never enough,two is too many,

03:35.240 --> 03:38.040
and 12 well, you're looking at  12.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.480
yeah. it looks like roy got hit by a car --

03:40.510 --> 03:42.840
coroner's investigator estimates

03:42.880 --> 03:45.380
the body's been here since 2:00 a.m.

03:45.410 --> 03:48.680
like i was saying,maybe roy passes out,

03:48.710 --> 03:51.040
a drunk driver heads down the alley,

03:51.080 --> 03:53.140
runs him over,and keeps going.

03:53.180 --> 03:55.340
there's no lights back here and no sign of skid marks.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.540
i've got officers searching the area for damaged cars

03:57.580 --> 03:59.310
and a few more knocking on doors

03:59.340 --> 04:01.380
to see if anyone's heard something.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.740
well, no one has answered my original question why is this a priority?

04:04.780 --> 04:09.110
chief, this speed bump is roy wilkinson.

04:09.140 --> 04:10.540
who?

04:10.580 --> 04:13.980
in 1999, roy wilkinson was convicted of manslaughter

04:14.010 --> 04:16.880
after killing his girlfriend, carly mayhan.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.180
it's amazing, commander --

04:18.209 --> 04:20.310
two pieces of bullshit in one sentence.

04:20.339 --> 04:22.310
first, carly wasn't his girlfriend.

04:22.340 --> 04:24.280
he picked her up in a bar.

04:24.310 --> 04:26.480
and, second,manslaughter, my ass!

04:26.510 --> 04:27.640
it was flynn's case.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.980
i think it's safe to say

04:29.010 --> 04:31.140
that he took issue with the jury's verdict.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.680
they should have put this guy in jail for life.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.540
instead,he only gets eight years.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.740
carly mayhan is davis mayhan's daughter

04:37.780 --> 04:38.880
the movie producer.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.480
it was all over the news.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.040
not in atlanta.

04:44.980 --> 04:49.080
somebody must have used roy's name on an open channel.

04:49.110 --> 04:54.240
well, chief johnson, you might want to tune in tonight,

04:54.280 --> 04:55.440
because i assure you

04:55.480 --> 04:57.380
every network is going to run with this story.

04:57.410 --> 05:00.540
well, commander, don't let me stand between you and the cameras.

05:02.610 --> 05:05.780
chief, i could do a thorough investigation right now.

05:05.810 --> 05:08.280
a murdering scumbag alcoholic passes out in an alley

05:08.310 --> 05:09.780
and gets run over by a car,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.380
leaving the world a much better place.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.210
i'll write it up,and we'll all be home by noon.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.980
look, i'd love to be done with this by noon.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.240
you have no idea

05:19.280 --> 05:21.780
how much i'd like to be done with this by noon.

05:21.810 --> 05:24.710
but we have a dead body,a bunch of nosy reporters,

05:24.740 --> 05:26.510
and somebody fled the scene.

05:26.540 --> 05:29.280
so nobody is gonna be done with anything by noon!

05:29.310 --> 05:32.940
now, who has the number for the halfway house?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.110
the place is run by a private foundation.

05:36.140 --> 05:37.680
they call it a re-entry center.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.140
this one is hooked up with the parole program at victorville.

05:41.510 --> 05:43.980
yeah, most of these slugs treat parole like a weekend pass.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.110
they don't even get unpacked before they're back into trouble again.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.540
i'm karen silva.i'm the manager here.

05:51.580 --> 05:52.540
can i help you?

05:52.580 --> 05:54.240
yes, ma'am.we're with the l.a.p.d.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.610
we wanted to talk to you about roy wilkinson.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.840
what happened?

05:57.880 --> 06:00.210
i'm afraid there's been an accident, ma'am.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.440
roy was hit by a car.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.140
roy's dead.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.210
oh, no.what happened?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.210
um, they found him in an alley early this morning.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.440
it appears he'd been drinking.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.180
poor roy.

06:12.210 --> 06:13.980
it's a shame he fell off the wagon.

06:14.010 --> 06:15.940
yeah,more like under it.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.310
you don't seem surprised.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.180
i've learned not to be surprised anymore.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.240
i thought roy was getting better.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.180
people just don't understand how hard it is for these men.

06:27.210 --> 06:29.210
hard for them?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.510
lieutenant...

06:30.540 --> 06:33.240
why don't you go interview sleeping beauty over there,

06:33.280 --> 06:35.410
while ms. silva shows us roy's room?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.580
that sound good?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.340
sure. come with me.

06:47.010 --> 06:49.140
this is roy's bunk.

06:52.510 --> 06:54.410
which one of these dressers is roy's?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.910
the one on the right.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.710
no family photos.

06:58.740 --> 07:01.180
roy was like most of the guys who wind up here.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.440
if he had any family,

07:02.480 --> 07:04.710
they didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore.

07:04.740 --> 07:06.610
how did, uh, how did roy get along with the other residents?

07:06.640 --> 07:08.710
well, i'm not here around the clock,

07:08.740 --> 07:12.240
but i would know if there were any problems.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.380
i did hear that someone on the outside was hassling him.

07:16.410 --> 07:17.480
who would that be?

07:17.510 --> 07:20.840
i asked him. he didn't want to talk about it.

07:28.410 --> 07:31.480
that's his one-year a.a. chip.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.980
he just got it.

07:34.010 --> 07:36.280
he was so proud.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.380
did did roy have a job?

07:40.410 --> 07:42.810
he just lost another one.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.940
do you think that might be one of the reasons

07:44.980 --> 07:48.610
why roy started drinking again after a year of sobriety?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.940
i've learned through experience that alcohol doesn't need a reason.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.710
i think these should cover everyone

07:58.740 --> 08:01.640
who's been in residence here for the last year and a half.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.480
thank you. if you think of anything else at all,please give us a call.

08:05.510 --> 08:06.880
yes, do.

08:06.910 --> 08:10.180
um, could you get us a copy of roy's death certificate?

08:10.210 --> 08:11.110
for...

08:11.140 --> 08:12.540
well, there won't be a funeral.

08:12.580 --> 08:15.210
they'll just cremate him unless somebody sees to the details.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.710
i don't think that's right.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.180
no, that doesn't seem right. i'll make sure we send one over.

08:19.210 --> 08:20.680
thank you.

08:20.690 --> 08:21.600
thank you, ms. silva.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.360
yes.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.400
hang on, lieutenant tao, o-one second.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.230
uh, what did he say about roy?

08:27.260 --> 08:29.300
quiet, kept to himself --

08:29.330 --> 08:32.500
you know, the usual homicidal-maniac routine.

08:32.530 --> 08:35.900
you can stay and talk to the rest of them.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.929
yes, lieutenant?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.159
right now?

08:52.930 --> 08:55.430
daniels called from the morgue.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.800
roy had both his femur bones crushed,

08:58.830 --> 09:00.330
plus cracked ribs

09:00.360 --> 09:02.930
and massive internal injuries to the chest.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.130
we assumed that when the front wheel went over the upper body

09:06.160 --> 09:08.160
that the rear wheel went over the legs.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.900
we've been running over all these dummies

09:09.930 --> 09:11.760
trying to figure out how roy managed to get

09:11.800 --> 09:13.630
two sets of injuries so close together.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.830
yeah, but the only way the tire patterns made any sense

09:15.860 --> 09:17.630
was that when the car ran over the body,

09:17.660 --> 09:19.400
it suddenly turned to the right.

09:19.430 --> 09:20.960
but the alley is too narrow.

09:20.990 --> 09:21.930
it would have hit the wall,

09:21.930 --> 09:23.430
and there's no paint marks anywhere.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.300
please. my head is about to explode.

09:25.330 --> 09:26.930
i assume you didn't bring us back down here

09:26.960 --> 09:28.900
just to catalog all the things you don't know.

09:28.930 --> 09:32.230
there's a trail of oil right down the middle of the alley.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.560
there's a lot of oil in this alley.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.200
there is, but not all of it's fresh.

09:37.230 --> 09:39.630
walk with me. please.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.000
this puddle of oil here,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.400
a few yards from the body,

09:51.430 --> 09:52.860
comes out of nowhere,

09:53.010 --> 09:53.990
which got me thinking --

09:54.100 --> 09:55.830
when the car ran over roy wilkinson,

09:55.860 --> 09:58.160
roy did a little damage to the car.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.860
maybe broke the oil pan.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.930
that's what i'm talking about.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.700
this spot here tells me maybe the driver stopped,

10:06.730 --> 10:09.260
got out, said, "oh, my god. what have i done?"

10:09.300 --> 10:10.800
then took off again.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.600
walk with me.

10:16.530 --> 10:18.830
so, now the car is leaking oil,

10:18.860 --> 10:22.100
and we can follow the oil trail like breadcrumbs.

10:22.130 --> 10:25.000
walk with me.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.300
shows us exactly where the car went.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.600
walk with me.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.900
walk with me.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.430
walk with me.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.430
the son of a bitch drove around the block--

11:06.390 --> 11:08.290
came back to finish the job.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.520
what's the vehicle ran over roy wilkinson

11:19.520 --> 11:20.140
roy wilkinson a second time,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.740
we were able to follow the oil trail around the block,

11:22.780 --> 11:24.780
but, unfortunately, onto the westbound 10,

11:24.810 --> 11:26.840
and then it was impossible to isolate it.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.710
well, at least now we know we have a murder.

11:28.740 --> 11:31.610
and now we know we're looking for a car with a damaged oil pan.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.280
and we've been checking with garages,

11:33.310 --> 11:34.740
tow companies, auto dealerships

11:34.780 --> 11:36.340
to see if anyone brought in a vehicle

11:36.380 --> 11:38.940
with this type of damage,but so far,nothing.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.540
i tracked down most of the residents.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.480
none of them admits to knowing much about roy.

11:42.510 --> 11:43.740
any of them own a car?

11:43.780 --> 11:46.080
well, there are two cars at the halfway house.

11:46.110 --> 11:49.710
one belongs to this guy -- jim francis.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.610
but supposedly he can't drive it,

11:51.640 --> 11:53.780
as he got his license suspended -- d.u.i.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.840
the other one is a datsun 210 --

11:57.140 --> 11:58.840
couldn't go over a pathway much less a person

11:58.880 --> 12:01.510
but i've got s.i.d. checking out both vehicles

12:01.540 --> 12:03.410
for any traces of roy juice.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.710
any word from roy's parole officer?

12:06.740 --> 12:08.480
his voicemail says he's out of town.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.940
comes back tomorrow.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.510
anything useful come out of commander taylor's press release?

12:12.540 --> 12:15.240
four calls saying "it is a good day,"

12:15.280 --> 12:17.680
a guy called and said that he killed roy wilkinson,

12:17.710 --> 12:19.340
though he claimed he shot him,

12:19.380 --> 12:23.110
an insurance agency, a couple of ambulance-chasing lawyers,

12:23.140 --> 12:25.980
and 13 people reporting reckless drivers.

12:26.010 --> 12:27.480
and a partridge in a pear tree.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.940
i think that we should follow up on all of them,please.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.410
and in the meantime, i think we should focus our efforts

12:32.440 --> 12:34.710
on trying to find a car with a newly broken oil pan.

12:34.740 --> 12:37.210
and, sergeant gabriel, just give me one minute.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.440
and i think

12:38.480 --> 12:40.940
that we should introduce ourselves to the mayhans.

12:41.940 --> 12:42.980
thank you.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.440
hello. you've reached fritz howard.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.140
leave a message, and i'll call you back.

12:47.210 --> 12:48.140
i'm so sorry, fritzi.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.610
my hit-and-run turned out to be

12:49.640 --> 12:52.540
a hit-and-run-around-the-block-and-then-hit-'em-again...

12:52.580 --> 12:53.880
and run.

12:53.910 --> 12:56.080
anyway, my entire day is shot.

12:56.110 --> 13:00.240
so i was hoping that we could reschedule our nooner

13:00.280 --> 13:03.640
to an eighter...or a niner.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.210
sergeant gabriel mentioned

13:07.240 --> 13:09.740
that you were about to go see the mayhans.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.210
i am.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.880
let's go watch some tv.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.710
carly mayhan's killer was found dead

13:22.740 --> 13:24.440
in what police say was a hit-and-run

13:24.480 --> 13:26.240
after spending eight years in prison.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.010
pick a channel --any channel.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.440
for davis mayhan, this is not

13:29.480 --> 13:31.880
the hollywood ending he would have envisioned,

13:31.910 --> 13:34.010
but perhaps it will provide closure.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.610
i can't help what they put on the news.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.210
but you can't ignore it.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.610
are you telling me i can't talk to two possible suspects?

13:40.640 --> 13:43.280
please. "persons of interest" is the correct phrase.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.640
and explain to me why the mayhans

13:45.680 --> 13:47.740
are more viable suspects than an entire halfway house

13:47.780 --> 13:49.780
full of recently released convicts.

13:49.810 --> 13:51.540
because the mayhans have a motive.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.940
look, my first interview with a sus--

13:54.980 --> 13:57.040
a person of interest is the most important,

13:57.080 --> 13:59.510
seeing how they react before they've had an opportunity --

13:59.540 --> 14:01.310
yes, thank you for the tutorial.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.710
now allow me to give you one.

14:02.740 --> 14:05.640
i, uh,i think i should go.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.940
no. no, no, sergeant.stay, please.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.040
i think it's important for you to understand

14:09.080 --> 14:10.310
how to strike a balance

14:10.340 --> 14:12.480
between what chief johnson does and what i do.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.680
because, you see,for all of her talents,

14:14.710 --> 14:16.940
your boss has a tin ear when it comes to politics

14:16.980 --> 14:18.540
and handling the media.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.810
while chief pope seems to think of nothing else.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.140
yeah,because, sergeant,

14:23.210 --> 14:25.710
when the media see her face at the mayhans',

14:25.740 --> 14:28.080
it will become impossible for chief johnson

14:28.110 --> 14:30.040
to run an investigation on her terms.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.040
well, thank you so much for the advice,

14:32.080 --> 14:34.280
but i would rather not give the mayhans time

14:34.310 --> 14:37.010
to consult an attorney or get their story straight.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.140
did you really get the impression there

14:39.180 --> 14:41.210
that i was offering you advice?

14:42.640 --> 14:45.240
sergeant, were you under that impression?

14:48.780 --> 14:50.040
no, sir.

14:52.540 --> 14:54.840
listen to me.

14:54.880 --> 14:59.740
if you speak with the mayhans,you will do so in my office.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.580
so you are ordering me to call the mayhans

15:04.610 --> 15:07.180
and invite them down here at their leisure?

15:07.210 --> 15:08.840
oh, no. no.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.240
i do not want you to call the mayhans.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.840
hey, laura.andy flynn.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.540
yeah, i'm fine. thank you.and you?

15:19.580 --> 15:20.980
oh, that's good.

15:21.010 --> 15:23.980
so, i guess you heard about today's fortunate events.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.580
well,that's why i called.

15:25.610 --> 15:27.680
i know how much this means to you and davis,

15:27.710 --> 15:29.080
and i would love it

15:29.110 --> 15:32.610
if the two of you could stop down at parker center today

15:32.640 --> 15:36.380
so we can catch you up on all the details of the case.

15:36.410 --> 15:39.240
cause you deserve to know.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.580
all right, great.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.140
okay. see you soon.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.140
anyone else you want me to lie to?

15:45.180 --> 15:48.040
thank you, lieutenant.i know that was unpleasant.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.840
but it's all for the best.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.110
for who?

15:51.140 --> 15:53.280
these people trust me, chief or they used to.

15:53.310 --> 15:55.310
and i'm hoping to eliminate them as suspects.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.910
let them bring a lawyer into this,

15:56.940 --> 15:58.380
it's just gonna drag on and on.

15:58.410 --> 16:00.980
that asshole strangled a 22-year-old girl

16:01.010 --> 16:02.540
while having sex with her,

16:03.380 --> 16:05.540
and the court only gave him eight years.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.110
now you want to drag these nice people

16:07.110 --> 16:08.110
through the mud over his death?

16:08.140 --> 16:10.180
sometimes good people are capable of bad things.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.880
there have to be consequences for that.

16:11.910 --> 16:14.980
when the guy getting run over is roy wilkinson,

16:15.010 --> 16:17.580
then the consequences ought to be a ticker-tape parade.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.110
we don't get to determine

16:19.140 --> 16:22.280
which victims are worthy of our attention, lieutenant.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.880
and we can't pick and choose

16:23.910 --> 16:26.480
which parts of the justice system we want to uphold.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.810
t-that's beautiful, chief.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.140
so, if you'll excuse me,

16:30.180 --> 16:32.310
i think i need to throw up a little.

16:38.610 --> 16:40.440
it's good to see you, andy.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.380
you too, laura.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.140
you're looking good. lose weight?

16:43.180 --> 16:44.880
yeah, well, i went vegetarian,

16:44.910 --> 16:47.680
but don't tell my friends back in jersey that, okay?

16:47.710 --> 16:50.210
uh, this is my boss, deputy chief brenda johnson.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.640
-hello. -and this is her boss, assistant chief will pope.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.080
-good to meet you. -how do you do?

16:54.110 --> 16:56.710
thank you so much for coming in to speak with us today.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.080
thank you. we know that you don't have to do this.

16:59.110 --> 17:00.910
so, i assume you've heard a little bit

17:00.940 --> 17:02.510
about what happened this morning.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.609
when the reporters started gathering on our lawn,

17:04.640 --> 17:06.040
we figured something was up.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.440
we heard it was a hit-and-run.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.310
there are facts that lead us to believe

17:09.339 --> 17:10.940
that roy wilkinson was murdered.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.339
facts?

17:12.380 --> 17:13.980
and if we don't get out ahead of this,

17:14.010 --> 17:17.240
we're afraid that the press might start jumping to conclusions.

17:19.180 --> 17:22.410
andy,what's she saying?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.180
um, i-i'd like to know if you and your wife

17:25.210 --> 17:28.680
have had any contact whatsoever with the victim

17:28.710 --> 17:29.880
prior to his death.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.110
a victim?

17:32.140 --> 17:33.210
mr. wilkinson.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.240
now he's the victim.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.040
the last time i saw that monster was in a courtroom,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.680
and he got an eight-year sentence

17:39.710 --> 17:41.940
for murdering my daughter.

17:41.980 --> 17:43.880
okay. good.

17:43.910 --> 17:46.210
now, just in order to dot our i's and cross our t's,

17:46.240 --> 17:49.810
we'd like to take a peek at your cars, if you don't mind.

17:52.010 --> 17:53.340
you're kidding.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.140
all right. it sounds like we're suspects.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.140
andy, do you think we're suspects?

17:57.140 --> 17:58.140
look, laura, davis

17:58.150 --> 18:00.150
i don't like this...

18:00.440 --> 18:03.140
listen, the more careful we are with this now,

18:03.180 --> 18:05.240
the less damage the press can do to your reputations.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.810
lieutenant flynn can come to your home

18:06.840 --> 18:08.980
in an unmarked car with a couple of our lab guys --

18:09.010 --> 18:11.440
no, that won't be necessary.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.740
you can't look at our cars --not without a search warrant.

18:14.780 --> 18:18.110
mr. mayhan, our intent here is not to upset you.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.140
too late.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.540
we really just wanted

18:20.580 --> 18:22.380
to eliminate you and your wife as suspects.

18:22.410 --> 18:24.140
you want to eliminate me as a suspect?

18:24.180 --> 18:25.080
all right, honey.

18:25.110 --> 18:26.840
was it a long, painful death?

18:26.880 --> 18:29.380
was he brutally tortured before he died?

18:30.680 --> 18:31.910
no.

18:31.940 --> 18:34.110
then it wasn't me.

18:41.940 --> 18:44.610
well,that went real well.

18:52.010 --> 18:53.840
fritzi,i've spent the entire day

18:53.880 --> 18:56.840
smelling a boozy corpse and getting yelled at.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.010
i'm not feeling very romantic.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.840
neither am i.

19:06.610 --> 19:08.640
how was your day?

19:08.680 --> 19:10.240
well, if you can't fall asleep,

19:10.280 --> 19:11.940
you ought to be able to watch tv.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.280
oh! this is ridiculous. i'm taking you to the doctor.

19:16.310 --> 19:17.540
no doctors!

19:17.580 --> 19:20.080
they're just gonna tell me what i already know --

19:20.110 --> 19:22.110
to stay at home,lie flat on my back,

19:22.140 --> 19:23.310
which i am trying to do.

19:23.340 --> 19:26.340
well, i can't just stand here and watch you suffer.

19:28.140 --> 19:31.880
w-what --what are you doing?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.340
what are those?

19:36.380 --> 19:37.680
they work for me.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.280
vicodin? where did you get vicodin?

19:41.310 --> 19:42.610
last year --for my procedure.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.180
i can't take your pills.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.780
well, fine.

19:45.810 --> 19:46.780
then i will call dr. leland

19:46.780 --> 19:47.780
and have him get you your own prescription.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.240
put the phone down,please.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.210
you are getting help --

19:50.240 --> 19:51.780
-you're not helping me. -yes, i am.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.110
stop!

19:53.140 --> 19:54.840
brenda. sweetie.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.940
i appreciate what you're trying to do,

19:58.010 --> 20:00.810
but giving vicodin to an alcoholic is not help.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.180
oh, right.

20:04.210 --> 20:05.410
i'm sorry.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.580
no pills. i don't know why i keep forgetting that.

20:07.610 --> 20:10.380
because you constantly dismiss addiction as a problem

20:10.410 --> 20:12.210
and we never talk about it ever.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.240
okay, fine. let's discuss it now.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.880
now? really? seriously?

20:16.910 --> 20:17.840
in the middle of the night,

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
while i'm lying on the floor in pain?

20:18.880 --> 20:19.810
oh, sorry. sorry.

20:21.910 --> 20:23.180
well, what can i do?

20:23.210 --> 20:25.440
get me your big bag of cookies,

20:25.480 --> 20:28.310
the remote to the television, and answer your phone.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.680
answer your --

20:32.710 --> 20:35.780
deputy chief johnson's line.

20:35.810 --> 20:37.340
may i ask who's calling?

20:37.380 --> 20:38.310
just a minute.

20:38.340 --> 20:39.580
detective daniels.

20:39.610 --> 20:40.740
ohh. at this hour?

20:40.780 --> 20:43.580
hello, detective daniels. you're working late.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.640
no reason to go home.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.480
uh, i just got off the phone

20:47.510 --> 20:49.710
with that insurance investigator --

20:49.740 --> 20:52.110
jim petersen of american omaha life.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.240
life?

20:53.280 --> 20:55.410
roy wilkinson had a life-insurance policy?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.640
ow! ohh! watch where you're going!

20:57.680 --> 20:59.980
uh, on the low end -- $80,000.

21:00.010 --> 21:03.210
petersen is gonna fax over the full policy tomorrow morning,

21:03.240 --> 21:05.810
but he did tell me over the phone

21:05.840 --> 21:08.680
the beneficiary is a...patricia simmons.

21:08.710 --> 21:10.680
ex-wife or ex-girlfriend?

21:10.710 --> 21:12.240
i'm not sure who she is.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.280
but i can tell you where she works.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.840
reporters have been calling here all day.

21:17.880 --> 21:18.840
please.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.940
thank you.

21:19.980 --> 21:22.910
i don't feel like talking to any of them.

21:22.940 --> 21:27.210
do you know one reporter tried to ride the bus with me?

21:27.240 --> 21:28.480
i mean, really.

21:28.510 --> 21:31.780
were you and roy close, ms. simmons?

21:31.810 --> 21:33.510
oh, i don't know.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.680
i'm not here every day.

21:35.710 --> 21:37.610
i-i volunteer a couple times a week,

21:37.640 --> 21:39.440
so i don't get a chance

21:39.480 --> 21:42.810
to get to know most of the men really well.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.510
i had no idea roy was the one

21:45.540 --> 21:49.840
that did all those awful things to that mayhan girl.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.580
he was kind to me.

21:52.610 --> 21:55.610
i was helping him with his g.e.d.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.580
i just...can't believe this.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.580
did roy ever talk to you about money?

22:00.610 --> 22:02.880
well, not really.

22:02.910 --> 22:05.310
other than to complain he didn't have any.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.780
he had enough to pay for a life-insurance policy,

22:07.810 --> 22:10.740
and he named you as the beneficiary.

22:10.780 --> 22:12.680
a-a what?

22:12.710 --> 22:14.780
life insurance.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.710
see?

22:16.740 --> 22:18.840
your name -- right here.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.940
why would he do that?

22:22.980 --> 22:25.310
you didn't know he was leaving you this money?

22:25.340 --> 22:29.410
no, not at all. roy didn't say a word.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.680
good lord.

22:30.710 --> 22:35.540
even my husband didn't leave me anything like that.

22:35.580 --> 22:39.810
oh, i-i don't feel right taking this.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.210
roy must have cared for you very much.

22:42.240 --> 22:46.310
well, i try to treat all of them like they were my own kids.

22:46.340 --> 22:49.310
did you ever get the sense that roy was drinking again?

22:49.340 --> 22:50.180
no.

22:50.210 --> 22:51.710
anything out of the ordinary

22:51.740 --> 22:54.240
happen recently that might have upset him?

22:54.280 --> 22:56.240
an argument? old girlfriend?

22:57.380 --> 22:58.780
there was something.

22:58.810 --> 23:02.880
a couple of weeks ago, someone sent him flowers.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.510
flowers?

23:04.540 --> 23:06.310
but they didn't make him happy.

23:06.340 --> 23:08.240
he just threw them out right away.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.380
do you know who sent them?

23:09.410 --> 23:10.340
no.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.310
or what florist they were from?

23:12.340 --> 23:13.380
no.

23:13.410 --> 23:16.080
but i took the flowers out of the trash

23:16.110 --> 23:19.140
and i brought them home.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.780
the arrangement was beautiful.

23:22.810 --> 23:24.810
still haven't found any cars in neighbourhood

23:24.810 --> 23:25.810
damaged to the oil pan,

23:25.840 --> 23:27.210
and s.i.d. says the two cars

23:27.210 --> 23:29.210
flynn found at the halfway house are clean.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.180
and as for those flowers,

23:31.210 --> 23:33.540
i'm coming up empty on roy's secret admirer.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.140
t-the flower business is nothing.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.410
i mean, r-roy probably had one of those wacko pen pals

23:39.440 --> 23:40.710
while he was in prison --

23:40.740 --> 23:43.240
you know, lonely ladies who love from a safe distance.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.710
yeah, but if we could tie those flowers to the mayhans,

23:45.740 --> 23:47.340
then that might give us enough

23:47.380 --> 23:49.480
to get a warrant to search their vehicles.

23:49.510 --> 23:53.010
baloney. i'm telling you --the flowers are a waste of time.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.010
but they're all we have to go on so far.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.110
so check the visitors logs

23:56.140 --> 23:58.010
for the prison and halfway house, please.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.810
and, lieutenant tao, i'd like you to get in touch

23:59.840 --> 24:01.440
with all the florists in the area.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.510
i want to know who sent those flowers.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.580
don't bother.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.980
and why would i not bother, lieutenant?

24:09.510 --> 24:11.440
i sent the flowers.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.810
please tell me why, lieutenant.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.310
because it's the anniversary of carly's death,

24:24.340 --> 24:27.080
and i wanted roy never, ever to forget what he had done,

24:27.110 --> 24:28.540
because i wasn't going to.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.710
so you sent him flowers?

24:30.740 --> 24:31.880
and a card.

24:38.010 --> 24:41.340
so, what did this card say?

24:44.180 --> 24:45.240
what did the card say?

24:45.280 --> 24:50.240
it said... "happy death day."

24:50.280 --> 24:52.340
that is just enough for a decent defense attorney

24:52.380 --> 24:55.180
to make you a suspect in roy's murder.

24:55.210 --> 24:57.010
chief, every year, this date hits me.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.680
i mean, don't you have a case

24:58.710 --> 25:00.680
that you took a little more personally?

25:00.710 --> 25:02.440
carly and her parents deserve justice.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.040
and whether you like it or not,

25:04.080 --> 25:05.840
roy wilkinson deserves the same.

25:09.940 --> 25:12.680
you do understand that the right thing for me to do

25:12.710 --> 25:14.440
is to take you off this case?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.880
please don't.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.540
the, uh, parole officer's here.

25:19.580 --> 25:20.980
thank you.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.880
i was up north, trying to find another one of my parolees

25:26.910 --> 25:28.580
who decided not to call in.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.040
jackass.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.610
so, what did i miss?

25:31.640 --> 25:34.540
i was hoping that you could give me some inside information

25:34.580 --> 25:36.010
on roy wilkinson.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.640
in your opinion, was he just another jackass?

25:39.940 --> 25:41.180
so-so.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.680
did you know that roy took out a life-insurance policy?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.610
he left the money to a ms. simmons

25:46.640 --> 25:47.780
at the halfway house.

25:49.410 --> 25:51.840
well, some ex-cons find jesus or mohammed.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.810
roy found an insurance agent.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.810
or an insurance agent found roy.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.710
did he have any enemies at the halfway house?

25:57.740 --> 25:58.710
no.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.910
any drinking buddies?

25:59.940 --> 26:02.310
no, no, no. roy always passed his drug tests.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.110
he was a regular at a.a. meetings.

26:04.140 --> 26:07.880
what would cause someone who's been sober for a year

26:07.910 --> 26:09.980
to start drinking again?

26:10.010 --> 26:13.140
you know, guilt, depression --usual stuff.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.810
i understand it was hard for roy to keep down a job.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.340
yeah. yeah. roy got fired a few times.

26:17.380 --> 26:19.210
why?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.580
well, as roy tells it,

26:20.610 --> 26:23.610
laura mayhan would show up wherever he was working,

26:23.640 --> 26:25.480
pass out newspaper clippings,

26:25.510 --> 26:27.710
telling his employer and the customers

26:27.740 --> 26:29.780
how roy had murdered her daughter.

26:29.810 --> 26:32.210
not a lot of businesses looking for that kind of p.r.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.740
so mrs. mayhan was harassing him?

26:34.780 --> 26:36.810
well, you know, you ask a judge -- no.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.240
i mean, mrs. mayhan was not breaking any laws.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.580
she could tell his employer any story she wanted.

26:42.610 --> 26:44.210
did you ask her to stop?

26:46.080 --> 26:49.210
you know, i've been doing this a long time,

26:49.240 --> 26:50.840
and here's the thing --

26:50.880 --> 26:53.910
not everyone stops when you tell them to.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.780
mrs. mayhan...

26:57.540 --> 26:59.880
...i don't think she wanted to stop.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.820
i understand.

27:08.850 --> 27:09.950
no, no, no, no, no.

27:09.980 --> 27:11.480
look, i'm being ordered to do this.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.920
i don't care whose fault it is.

27:12.950 --> 27:14.680
hey, guys, over here. they're here.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.920
is davis mayhan a suspect in the murder of roy wilkinson?

27:16.950 --> 27:19.720
do you have any new evidence here?

27:24.980 --> 27:27.880
congratulations. i've never seen you handle the press better.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.450
i didn't say a word to them.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.620
exactly.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.280
now that they've seen you here,

27:33.320 --> 27:35.120
i'm gonna have to give them something.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.980
i'll try and keep it vague, but i can tell you right now,

27:38.020 --> 27:39.220
lead on the story is

27:39.220 --> 27:41.220
"davis mayhan -- suspect in wilkinson murder."

27:41.250 --> 27:42.820
well, commander, given your media skills,

27:42.850 --> 27:44.350
i'm sure you'll find some handy way

27:44.350 --> 27:46.350
to spin this to our advantage.

27:46.380 --> 27:49.450
so, spin, commander. spin.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.450
our attorney's already been on the phone with your chief pope,

27:54.480 --> 27:56.920
and he did not authorize this search warrant.

27:56.950 --> 27:59.080
a judge authorized the search warrant.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.750
and none of this would have been necessary

28:00.750 --> 28:01.750
if you had simply cooperated

28:01.780 --> 28:04.050
and if your wife hadn't lied.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.650
what are you talking about?

28:06.680 --> 28:08.180
two days ago, you both assured me

28:08.220 --> 28:11.350
that you hadn't seen roy wilkinson since his sentencing,

28:11.380 --> 28:12.550
when, in fact,

28:12.580 --> 28:15.620
your wife has been following him and harassing him.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.050
that is ridiculous.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.180
laura.

28:21.550 --> 28:24.150
i wanted the world to know the truth about that man.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.720
roy thought that he could get a job

28:25.720 --> 28:26.720
and just go on with his life.

28:26.750 --> 28:27.750
oh, my god.

28:27.780 --> 28:28.980
i couldn't let that happen.

28:29.020 --> 28:31.150
you understand that whoever ran him over

28:31.180 --> 28:32.780
must have been following him.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.550
how else would that person have found him in that alley?

28:35.580 --> 28:40.320
i followed him in his car, but i did not kill him.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.920
roy didn't have a car, mrs. mayhan.

28:43.950 --> 28:45.620
of course he did.

28:47.150 --> 28:49.220
are you sure you remember clearly?

28:49.250 --> 28:51.350
maybe someone was giving him a ride.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.080
our lawyer said not to talk to anybody.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.720
don't talk to me like i'm 5 years old, ms. johnson.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.780
i know what roy wilkinson looks like.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.880
i remember every wrinkle on his face.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.980
and i remember the crappy, blue oldsmobile toronado

29:05.020 --> 29:07.380
with the old blue plates that he's been driving.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.550
and i remember the look in his eyes

29:09.580 --> 29:11.680
when he walked out of that courtroom.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
you think i don't remember?

29:13.750 --> 29:15.850
the truth is, i can't forget!

29:15.880 --> 29:16.950
do you happen to remember

29:16.980 --> 29:18.680
where you were the night he was murdered?

29:18.720 --> 29:20.120
that is enough.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.150
do you remember the license-plate number on this blue car?

29:22.180 --> 29:25.380
-5-g-b-k-92. -no. no.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.450
-5-g-b-k-92! -go back.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.880
-5-g-b-k-92! -please. sweetheart.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.850
-5-g-b-k-92! -go upstairs.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.380
-5-g-b-k-92! -please, don't.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.050
sweetheart.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.880
thanks for looking out for us, andy.

29:42.620 --> 29:46.250
s.i.d. said there's no damage, no sign of recent repair,

29:46.280 --> 29:48.950
no blood, no skin, no clothing from roy

29:48.980 --> 29:50.380
in any of their cars.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.980
can i go back to being a suspect now?

29:55.480 --> 29:58.280
5-g-b-k-9-2 does come back

29:58.320 --> 30:00.680
to a blue 1991 oldsmobile toronado.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.520
it's registered to a guy named jerry nemec.

30:03.550 --> 30:04.550
jerry nemec.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.950
yeah, he did seven years for robbery --

30:06.980 --> 30:08.220
died three years ago.

30:08.250 --> 30:11.250
now, the thing is, his registration is up to date,

30:11.280 --> 30:14.920
and his last known address --halfway house.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.280
maybe jerry nemec left his car to roy?

30:18.320 --> 30:20.420
no. roy was in prison when jerry died.

30:20.450 --> 30:22.950
they didn't live at the house at the same time.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.850
besides, this car never showed up in flynn's search.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.850
so where is it?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.000
well, maybe one of roy's buddies at the halfway house

30:29.080 --> 30:31.780
took it off his hands after he died.

30:31.820 --> 30:32.920
wait a minute.

30:32.950 --> 30:34.050
wait a minute.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.350
it says right here

30:35.380 --> 30:38.250
that jerry nemec was killed in a hit-and-run.

30:38.280 --> 30:43.250
and it looks like he had a life-insurance policy, too.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.380
who else at the halfway house

30:45.420 --> 30:46.920
has a life-insurance policy?

30:46.950 --> 30:48.380
thank you.

30:48.420 --> 30:49.580
jim francis?

30:49.620 --> 30:50.520
yeah.

30:50.550 --> 30:51.620
hi. i'm brenda.

30:51.650 --> 30:52.550
okay.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.950
i just have a few questions for you.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.180
okay.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.420
now, how long ago were you released from prison?

30:58.450 --> 31:01.050
uh...about eight months ago.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.080
and how long have you been in a.a.?

31:04.120 --> 31:07.420
about eight months...off and on.

31:07.450 --> 31:09.050
are you drunk right now?

31:10.380 --> 31:12.820
um, define "drunk."

31:14.750 --> 31:16.680
do you own a car,mr. francis?

31:16.720 --> 31:20.050
yeah, but my license is suspended.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.320
do you have any friends or family

31:21.350 --> 31:23.380
that chauffeur you around town?

31:24.580 --> 31:27.280
me and my family aren't exactly close.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.350
well, that explains

31:28.380 --> 31:30.180
why you haven't designated any of them

31:30.220 --> 31:32.550
as beneficiaries to your life-insurance policy.

31:34.450 --> 31:36.880
what life-insurance policy?

31:39.720 --> 31:41.380
that's not your signature?

31:43.620 --> 31:44.650
no.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.250
thank you.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.120
ladies.

31:55.150 --> 31:57.480
thank you so much for coming in.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.320
i would have come to you,

31:59.320 --> 32:00.320
but -- crazy day.

32:00.350 --> 32:03.680
any-old-how,i have copies for both of you

32:03.720 --> 32:06.680
of roy wilkinson's death certificate.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.950
you'll need this to collect the life-insurance policy

32:08.980 --> 32:09.980
that roy left you,

32:10.020 --> 32:12.050
and karen will need one for the mortuary.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.950
have you decided what kind of service you're gonna have yet?

32:14.980 --> 32:16.080
not yet.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.550
is it going to be like the one

32:17.580 --> 32:19.480
you arranged for jerry nemec?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.150
i'm sorry?

32:25.280 --> 32:26.320
oh, shoot.

32:26.350 --> 32:28.080
i forgot my glasses.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.850
i'll be right back.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.120
okay.

32:47.780 --> 32:49.220
karen: we have nothing to worry about.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.150
we didn't have anything to do with this.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.950
so, sergeant,you see how useful it is

32:54.980 --> 32:59.820
to observe a person's first reaction to information.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.250
ladies.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.050
they were here all along.

33:15.180 --> 33:17.150
sweetie,it only gets worse.

33:17.180 --> 33:18.680
oh,that's what i've heard.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.280
you both are so incredible.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.480
all the good you do for these men,

33:25.480 --> 33:26.480
it's not surprising

33:26.520 --> 33:29.380
that they'd want to do something nice in return.

33:29.420 --> 33:32.020
well, a good deed is its own reward.

33:32.050 --> 33:35.180
sure, but a good deed and a life-insurance policy is even better.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.450
it's such a coincidence

33:38.480 --> 33:42.020
that both roy and jerry died the exact same way --

33:42.050 --> 33:44.420
drunk and hit by a car.

33:44.450 --> 33:48.620
it's unfortunate that so many of these released criminals

33:48.650 --> 33:51.220
fall into the same destructive patterns of behavior.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.080
hold that thought.

33:59.450 --> 34:02.380
oh, mr. francis.thank you so much for waiting.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.180
excuse me one second.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.280
did you talk to him?

34:17.320 --> 34:19.350
no. why would i?

34:20.420 --> 34:23.650
chief, you haven't read them their rights.

34:23.679 --> 34:25.020
no.

34:25.050 --> 34:28.580
they haven't given me a reason to -- yet.

34:38.949 --> 34:40.550
thank you for your patience.

34:40.580 --> 34:42.650
i had to say goodbye to mr. francis,

34:42.679 --> 34:43.920
who i just interviewed.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.520
do you think that jim francis

34:45.550 --> 34:47.080
had something to do with roy's death?

34:47.120 --> 34:48.880
oh, i'm certain of it.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.050
and it's strange,you know?

34:50.060 --> 34:53.050
i mean about he and roy have so much in common

34:53.060 --> 34:56.050
exconvicts£¬no families£¬struggled with addiction

34:56.060 --> 34:59.050
and they both have life-insurance policies

34:59.060 --> 35:01.050
the only difference is

35:01.060 --> 35:04.050
jim francis doesn't have a car mark across his chest

35:04.060 --> 35:05.050
what?

35:05.060 --> 35:06.050
well don't you have to run him over

35:06.060 --> 35:08.050
before you can collect the life-insurance money?

35:08.060 --> 35:10.050
what is she saying patty?

35:11.060 --> 35:13.050
i will read you that

35:14.060 --> 35:17.050
roy wilkinson's life-insurance policy--$80,000

35:17.060 --> 35:19.050
beneficiary --patricia simmons.

35:19.060 --> 35:22.050
and roy had a second policy --$150,000.

35:22.060 --> 35:24.050
beneficiary -- karen silva.

35:24.060 --> 35:26.050
the new claim hasn't been made yet

35:26.060 --> 35:29.050
jerry nemec's policy--$80,000

35:29.080 --> 35:31.150
beneficiary --patricia simmons.

35:31.180 --> 35:33.680
and he had a second policy --$150,000.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.720
beneficiary -- karen silva.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.550
bill johnson,luther madison --

35:37.580 --> 35:39.380
four men in the past five years,

35:39.420 --> 35:42.550
all living at your facility,all with life-insurance policies

35:42.580 --> 35:44.950
naming one or both of you as beneficiaries.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.320
all from different companies,of course.

35:47.350 --> 35:49.650
and it doesn't take an expert to see

35:49.680 --> 35:52.850
that all of these policies are written in the same hand.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.750
no, no.you don't understand.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.580
there are no families to pay for it,

35:56.620 --> 35:58.320
the state won't pay for it,

35:58.350 --> 36:01.180
and it is not cheap to give a man a decent funeral.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.420
and we can't afford it on what we make.

36:03.450 --> 36:06.250
i-i'm a volunteer. all i've got is my social security.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.750
so, you identify the hardest cases...

36:08.780 --> 36:11.980
and we make arrangements --just in case.

36:12.020 --> 36:14.380
well, you've become awfully good at identifying men

36:14.420 --> 36:18.120
who are 366 days away from being run over in an alley,

36:18.150 --> 36:21.050
because that is the exact way that all of these men died

36:21.080 --> 36:23.480
one year after you take out a policy.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.120
coincidentally, one year is the same amount of time

36:26.150 --> 36:28.480
it takes for a life-insurance policy to vest.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.120
now...

36:30.150 --> 36:32.550
i know you killed roy wilkinson.

36:32.580 --> 36:36.150
my question is...

36:36.180 --> 36:40.050
why does jim francis only have one policy?

36:40.080 --> 36:43.080
why does only karen get to cash in on him?

36:46.820 --> 36:48.950
it says so right here.

36:52.650 --> 36:54.420
you greedy bitch!

36:54.450 --> 36:55.550
patty, shut up!

36:55.580 --> 36:57.520
you greedy hoo.

37:00.550 --> 37:01.580
not another word!

37:07.520 --> 37:09.620
not another word!

37:09.650 --> 37:10.920
you said we were done!

37:10.950 --> 37:12.350
i said shut your mouth!

37:12.380 --> 37:15.650
you both have the right to remain silent.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.580
sergeant, could you...

37:17.620 --> 37:19.120
anything you say

37:19.150 --> 37:21.020
can be used against you in a court of law.

37:21.050 --> 37:23.550
you have the right to an attorney.

37:23.580 --> 37:25.020
i'll get you!

37:25.050 --> 37:26.880
if you cannot afford an attorney,

37:26.920 --> 37:28.380
one will be appointed to you.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.020
i can afford an attorney!

37:30.050 --> 37:31.150
you got to be kidding me.

37:31.180 --> 37:32.550
-do you understand these rights? -yes!

37:32.580 --> 37:33.720
all right. come on.

37:33.750 --> 37:36.050
easy, easy!ladies, that's enough!

37:36.080 --> 37:38.220
come on! easy!aaah!

37:38.250 --> 37:40.250
calm down. sit down.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.580
these men were criminals!

37:41.620 --> 37:43.720
they were drunks!

37:43.750 --> 37:46.380
with free housing and three meals a day!

37:46.420 --> 37:49.450
and we were waiting on them,getting older by the minute!

37:49.480 --> 37:51.820
at the end of the week,i could hardly stand up!

37:51.850 --> 37:53.820
and you're worried about roy wilkinson?!

37:53.850 --> 37:56.480
no. i'm worried about your retirement plan.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.120
now, i'm gonna write one of you up for murder in the first degree

38:00.150 --> 38:01.920
and one of you as an accessory.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.280
whose name goes where?

38:13.120 --> 38:14.580
we got roy drunk.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.050
he didn't want to go to the bar at first.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.880
but you told him that one drink wouldn't hurt,

38:19.920 --> 38:22.280
and you gave him another and another

38:22.320 --> 38:25.350
until you could practically pour him into that car --

38:25.380 --> 38:26.580
jerry nemec's car.

38:26.620 --> 38:30.080
roy passed out in the backseat,just like jerry.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.720
just like all the others.

38:31.750 --> 38:34.980
but a man who can't move is heavy.

38:35.020 --> 38:37.980
so you put him on a blanket

38:38.020 --> 38:40.120
and you pulled him out of the car

38:40.150 --> 38:42.780
and dragged him into the middle of that alley?

38:42.820 --> 38:44.320
yes.

38:44.350 --> 38:46.150
you know, you're --

38:46.180 --> 38:48.850
you're making it sound a lot worse than it was.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.350
after we hit him,i just wanted to go home.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.520
but you stopped to make sure he was dead.

38:56.550 --> 38:57.920
was he?

38:57.950 --> 39:00.050
no.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.050
he was just moaning.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.380
karen pulled the car away.

39:04.420 --> 39:06.880
i thought we were leaving.i was so relieved.

39:06.920 --> 39:10.250
and then she drove around the block and she did it again!

39:12.250 --> 39:14.150
karen? anything?

39:14.180 --> 39:16.480
she's lying.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.250
that'll be up to a jury

39:21.280 --> 39:24.350
to decide which one of you is telling the truth.

39:24.380 --> 39:27.150
i got to say,i don't like your odds.

39:40.350 --> 39:41.640
i just told commander taylor to arrange a press conferrence

39:41.640 --> 39:43.570
for the first thing in the morning

39:43.870 --> 39:45.800
let the world to know the meihans has nothing to do with this

39:46.330 --> 39:47.650
if you don't mind i think richard will

39:47.780 --> 39:49.230
handle this one

39:52.320 --> 39:54.020
-yea okay. -thanks

39:55.050 --> 39:55.900
hey cheif

39:59.490 --> 40:00.220
