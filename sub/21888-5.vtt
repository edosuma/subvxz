12:03.932 --> 12:05.434
I mean, it's not really dinner.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.060
I'll take some crackers.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.438

I worked 12 hours today.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.647

Do you want something?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.746
maybe you had thought
about that before,

12:26.788 --> 12:30.083
maybe just prepared something
or made a phone call

12:30.125 --> 12:32.961
or pushed some fucking buttons
on the microwave.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.257
Okay.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.843
Your house, your rules.

to get you something?

Hmm?

12:46.057 --> 12:48.226
What I would like you to do...

12:48.268 --> 12:50.729
-Yeah? -...is maybe notice
that I'm here.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.440
Maybe notice that I work
12 hours a day.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.233
Maybe notice that
I'm putting in extra hours

12:55.275 --> 12:56.860
so maybe you could have
an acupuncture treatment

12:56.902 --> 12:58.904

Although, I'll tell you,
I believe it.

I mean, he can dance,
he can really dance.

you can't learn how to dance

Yes, I'm still doing it.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.593
I've been waiting for this
for months.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.844
-Hey...
-I told you about it.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.429
Listen, you got to stop it.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.182
It's ridiculous. Dressing up
like a woman? Shush.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.767
It's fun. I like to perform.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.018
What's so wrong with that?

18:22.060 --> 18:23.645
Okay, well, you go perform,

18:23.686 --> 18:26.815
but you're not taking
my car with you. (sniffs)

18:26.856 --> 18:28.316

18:28.358 --> 18:30.318
You call yourself a taxi.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.611

you been, baby?

get him off, Celine.

a little soft bone in your mouth

19:36.676 --> 19:39.012
is better than
sleeping on the street.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.515

until I figure things out?

19:42.557 --> 19:44.392

20:00.950 --> 20:02.952

20:08.041 --> 20:10.668
You have a pageant
to get ready for,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.462
so don't worry about
that old, crusty queen.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.297
Now, your wigs are set.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.965
And sooner or later,
you're gonna have to learn

20:16.007 --> 20:17.800
how to style
your own party hats.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.677
Otherwise, I'm gonna
start charging you.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.560
Did you see Miss Talia's
new titties? (scoffs)

20:27.602 --> 20:30.396
Girl, she got pumped
too much and too fast

20:30.438 --> 20:31.856
with that Turtle Wax.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.733
That shit's gonna
fall to her ankles.

get pumped, you come see me

20:35.985 --> 20:37.445

to the right girl.

-Right here, right here.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.087
Hey. Hey.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.797
It's gonna be all right.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.423
Okay?
