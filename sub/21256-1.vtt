maybe that's the stuff?

you might wanna get out of

- Just like I love you.
- You shoot him, your life will be ruined.

24:35.277 --> 24:36.310
Haven't I always taken care of you?

24:36.362 --> 24:37.644
- I know you're angry.
- You never took care of me!

24:37.646 --> 24:39.313
- I've always taken care of you.
- Of course.

24:39.365 --> 24:41.148
You used me!

24:41.200 --> 24:42.316
Pulling the trigger is not the answer,

24:42.318 --> 24:43.317
Diamond, okay?

24:44.403 --> 24:46.286
He's not worth it.

24:46.322 --> 24:47.488
I just...

24:47.540 --> 24:49.323
I just want this to be over.

24:50.659 --> 24:52.409
(Loud Knocking On The Door)

24:52.461 --> 24:53.544
- MAN: Open the door!
- It's Munchie...

24:53.579 --> 24:55.245
RUSSELL: How the hell
he know we're here?

24:55.297 --> 24:57.214
- DIAMOND: Okay.
- CALLIE: Go, go, go!

24:57.249 --> 24:59.216
- (Loud Knocking Continues)
- MUNCHIE: Open the damn door!

24:59.251 --> 25:00.384
No, stop, stop, stop.

25:01.420 --> 25:04.171
(Heavy Thumping)

25:04.223 --> 25:05.506
The bathroom. Bathroom!

25:12.181 --> 25:15.232
(Muffled Yelling)

25:22.358 --> 25:24.575
(Muffled Grunts And Thumps)

26:00.229 --> 26:01.562
STEF: I need back up
at the All-Star Inn,

26:01.614 --> 26:03.397
11743 Campo Verde Street...

26:04.434 --> 26:06.467
Hell no, we won't go!

26:06.519 --> 26:08.553
Hell no, we won't go!

26:08.605 --> 26:10.638
Hell no, we won't go!

26:10.690 --> 26:12.557
Hell no, we won't go!

26:12.609 --> 26:14.559
- CROWD: Hell no, we won't go!
- Let's go.

26:14.611 --> 26:16.727
- Come on, it's getting ridiculous
- CROWD: Hell no, we won't go!

26:16.729 --> 26:19.280
Hell no, we won't go!

26:19.315 --> 26:21.399
Hell no, we won't go!

26:21.401 --> 26:23.734
- CROWD: Hell no, we won't go!
- Don't fight back!

26:23.736 --> 26:25.536
Hell no, we won't go!

26:25.572 --> 26:27.538
Hell no, we won't go!

26:27.574 --> 26:29.624
Hell no, we won't go!

26:29.659 --> 26:31.709
Hell no, we won't go!

26:31.744 --> 26:34.378
- Let me out.
- No.

26:34.614 --> 26:36.947
I said, let me out.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.949
- This is illegal.
- No.

26:39.002 --> 26:40.835
Hell no, we won't go!

26:40.870 --> 26:42.837
Hell no, we won't go!

26:42.872 --> 26:44.672
Hey, get your hands off my sister!

26:44.707 --> 26:46.624
Hell no, we won't go!

26:46.626 --> 26:49.927
- Ahh! (Groans)
- (Crowd Chants Echo)

26:50.062 --> 26:52.062
Jesus,

26:52.115 --> 26:54.565
I promise.

26:54.617 --> 26:57.651
Nothing ever happened
between me and Emma. Ever.

26:58.104 --> 26:59.870
I love you, Jesus.

26:59.906 --> 27:02.006
I would never cheat on you.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.674
But, but...

27:05.595 --> 27:06.744
But you guys have been like,

27:06.796 --> 27:07.928
whispering...

27:07.964 --> 27:09.964
and-and-and-and looking at
each other, you know? Like...

27:09.999 --> 27:11.582
shooting each other glances.

27:11.634 --> 27:12.716
And you were touching her!

27:12.752 --> 27:13.918
When?

27:13.920 --> 27:15.920
When we were playing piano.

27:15.972 --> 27:18.589
- (No Dialogue)
- EMMA: He was just...

27:18.591 --> 27:20.115
showing me where to put
my fingers on the keys,

27:20.116 --> 27:21.516
because I am so bad at it.

27:21.811 --> 27:24.929
And... and anytime you saw us
looking at each other, we... we...

27:26.732 --> 27:28.983
We were just trying to
figure out how to help you.

27:37.109 --> 27:39.827
No, wait, because you guys were, I...

27:39.862 --> 27:43.614
I had a dream, and Emma told
me that you guys were together.

27:53.676 --> 27:55.009
Okay. I guess, just
because I had a dream,

27:55.044 --> 27:56.677
doesn't mean it actually happened.

28:00.933 --> 28:02.750
Well, that's...

28:02.785 --> 28:04.018
That's okay, I think that, uh...

28:04.053 --> 28:05.970
(Clears Throat)

28:05.972 --> 28:08.856
I think dreams are...

28:08.891 --> 28:11.942
our brains' way of trying to...

28:11.978 --> 28:13.811
put together all the stuff

28:13.863 --> 28:15.563
going on in our lives.

28:15.615 --> 28:16.780
You know, and it...

28:16.816 --> 28:18.983
Well, it sounds to me
like your brain was just...

28:20.653 --> 28:22.620
trying to put together a story as to why

28:22.655 --> 28:24.038
Brandon and Emma are so close.

28:26.075 --> 28:27.992
When the real reason is...

28:27.994 --> 28:29.827
how much they care about you.

28:37.720 --> 28:38.836
(Indistinct Conversations)

28:38.838 --> 28:40.638
(Concerned Sighs)

28:40.673 --> 28:42.056
Oh, sweetheart.

28:42.091 --> 28:43.974
Is it any better? Is it working?

28:44.010 --> 28:45.726
Yeah, mostly.

28:45.761 --> 28:48.062
Good, just keep rinsing them
and give me a few minutes,

28:48.097 --> 28:49.597
and I'll get you home, okay?

28:49.649 --> 28:50.681
Okay.

28:54.854 --> 28:56.570
Well, good job.

28:56.606 --> 28:57.622
You didn't want any negative press

28:57.674 --> 29:00.124
and now you have our students being
injured by our security guards.

29:00.316 --> 29:01.599
And whose fault is that, Lena?

29:01.601 --> 29:03.517
It was your kids that escalated things.

29:03.569 --> 29:06.270
Stratos announced to the
kids what was happening,

29:06.322 --> 29:07.605
Stratos put his hands on my daughter,

29:07.657 --> 29:09.273
that's who escalated things.

29:10.660 --> 29:13.527
When I found out that you wanted
to turn the school private,

29:13.579 --> 29:16.414
I really, truly tried to give
you the benefit of the doubt.

29:16.449 --> 29:18.416
I tried to convince myself that...

29:18.451 --> 29:20.451
even if it was misguided,
you at least believed

29:20.453 --> 29:21.752
you were doing something good for kids.

29:21.788 --> 29:23.587
For some kids, anyway.

29:23.623 --> 29:25.456
Then, after tonight, I
really see your true colors.

29:25.458 --> 29:27.341
- And all you really care about is...
- I'm sorry, Lena.

29:27.377 --> 29:29.593
Sometimes, as principal, you
have to make tough decisions.

29:30.797 --> 29:32.346
Okay?

29:32.382 --> 29:33.631
Uh...

29:33.633 --> 29:35.299
You know, the thing is...

29:35.351 --> 29:36.634
Drew, that...

29:36.636 --> 29:38.469
technically, like...

29:38.471 --> 29:40.471
technically, you're not the principal.

29:40.473 --> 29:42.440
I haven't resigned.

29:43.476 --> 29:45.309
And now I'm not going to.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.696
Hmm.

29:48.731 --> 29:49.814
Well,

29:49.816 --> 29:51.449
good luck with that.

29:52.485 --> 29:54.402
WOMAN: Protest broke up so, um...

29:54.454 --> 29:55.653
I'm headin' home.

29:55.705 --> 29:56.654
Where you at now?

29:57.707 --> 29:58.823
Okay yeah, I'll stop by.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.376
MUNCHIE: Hey, what you got to say, man?

30:02.412 --> 30:05.463
- RUSSELL: (Muffled Yelling)
- Huh, what you got to say? Huh?

30:05.498 --> 30:06.797
MUNCHIE: I'm sick and tired, bro!

30:06.833 --> 30:08.332
RUSSELL: I get it, I get it.

- (Gunshot)
- (Loud Thump On The Floor)

30:11.838 --> 30:13.721
- We have to get out of here.
- Okay.

30:13.756 --> 30:15.840
(Sirens Wailing)

30:22.432 --> 30:23.564
POLICE: Freeze, your hands up!

30:24.817 --> 30:27.435
Gun! She's got a gun!

30:27.487 --> 30:28.519
POLICE: Drop it!

30:28.521 --> 30:29.820
Oh, no, no, don't shoot, don't shoot!

30:29.856 --> 30:31.572
- Drop your weapon!
- Don't shoot!

30:31.607 --> 30:33.858
I said drop your weapon! I'm
not going to warn you again!

30:33.860 --> 30:36.777

- OFFICER ♪2: Drop it!

- Drop your weapon!

They're okay!

30:44.579 --> 30:46.579
Hold your fire! That's my daughter.

30:46.631 --> 30:50.416
Diamond, Diamond, sweetheart
you have to put the gun down.

30:50.468 --> 30:52.752
You have to put the gun
down on the ground okay?

30:52.754 --> 30:53.887
It's gonna be okay.

30:54.189 --> 30:55.855
Just put it down on the ground.

30:56.992 --> 30:59.192
That's it. That's it.

30:59.244 --> 31:00.860
Okay, Good job.

31:00.862 --> 31:03.029
- Now where is Russell?
- He's in there.

31:03.031 --> 31:04.831
- Okay, 119?
- Yeah.

31:04.866 --> 31:07.166
Okay, 119! Beware, the
suspect may be armed.

31:07.202 --> 31:08.868
Go, go, go, go. Go, go!

31:11.039 --> 31:12.839
Let me see your hands!

31:28.974 --> 31:30.223
My mom's gonna be here in a second.

31:37.899 --> 31:39.032
I'm sorry...

31:40.118 --> 31:41.317
that I didn't tell you.

31:42.904 --> 31:43.987
Not that I did it.

31:46.274 --> 31:47.815
You're just so messed up from everything

31:47.816 --> 31:49.016
- I didn't wanna...
- No, it's okay.

31:51.079 --> 31:52.245
No, I get it.

31:52.247 --> 31:54.831
I am sorry that I yelled at you.

32:01.923 --> 32:03.089
I just...

32:03.141 --> 32:05.008
I hope that...

32:05.060 --> 32:06.092
that we're okay.

32:07.262 --> 32:09.262
Of course we are.

32:09.264 --> 32:11.064
Of course.

32:25.113 --> 32:26.195
LENA: So what happened?

32:26.247 --> 32:29.165
Uh, Jesus had a, uh...

32:29.200 --> 32:31.951
pretty violent reaction from
finding out what Brandon did.

32:31.953 --> 32:33.169
You know, taking Emma to...

32:33.204 --> 32:34.871
What do you mean, violent?

32:34.923 --> 32:36.923
Well, we found him

32:36.958 --> 32:38.207
taking a baseball bat

32:38.259 --> 32:39.926
to some of Brandon's stuff.

32:39.961 --> 32:41.294
- LENA: Are you serious?
- Yeah.

32:41.346 --> 32:44.964
Jesus, you took a baseball
bat to Brandon's room?

32:44.966 --> 32:46.182
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:46.217 --> 32:49.936
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I... I... I... I didn't... I meant...

32:49.971 --> 32:51.187
Okay, I'm...

32:51.222 --> 32:53.306
I'm sorry, I'm sorry honey, I know...

32:53.308 --> 32:55.808
this is just a symptom of your TBI...

32:55.860 --> 32:57.071
But honey, we've got to figure out

32:57.072 --> 32:59.140
a better way for you
to express your anger.

32:59.147 --> 33:01.898
You can't just go
around destroying things.

33:01.950 --> 33:03.066
Destroying what?

33:45.326 --> 33:48.027
Ah, that was intense.

33:48.029 --> 33:49.028
Yeah.

33:50.081 --> 33:51.280
Uh, thanks for

33:51.332 --> 33:52.999
hanging in with me though all that.

33:55.870 --> 33:56.919
So...

33:58.173 --> 34:00.006
Still think you're heading to Tahoe?

34:02.210 --> 34:04.127
Not right now.

34:04.179 --> 34:05.845
Now I...

34:05.880 --> 34:07.930
kinda feel like Jesus
needs me, you know?

34:07.966 --> 34:09.132
Okay.

34:10.185 --> 34:12.217
So, what about you and Mariana?

34:16.107 --> 34:19.025
Oh, I can't believe this
happened to you honey.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.943
It's okay, I just...

34:20.978 --> 34:22.110
wish it did something.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.196
You know? I mean...

34:23.231 --> 34:25.031
the whole protest.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.282
Why even bother? We lost.

34:26.317 --> 34:27.867
(Tea Kettle Whistling)

34:27.902 --> 34:30.987
Well, it turns out it
might not be over after all.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.239
What?

34:33.241 --> 34:35.074
Why?

34:35.076 --> 34:37.909
Drew took the principal's
vote at the board meeting.

34:38.963 --> 34:41.130
- And?
- And Drew's not the principal.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.081
Not officially.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.833
Monte still is.

34:44.886 --> 34:47.170
- So...
- So that means the vote isn't valid.

34:55.929 --> 34:58.064
I never should have stormed
out of therapy like I did.

35:00.068 --> 35:02.018
Just... Just too much.

35:05.156 --> 35:08.024
And if I'm being honest, I don't
remember leaving you and Jesus

35:08.076 --> 35:10.026
alone overnight when you were babies.

35:10.078 --> 35:11.160
I'm kind of amazed that you do.

35:13.164 --> 35:16.115
Well, it was pretty traumatic. So...

35:16.167 --> 35:18.000
Right.

35:18.036 --> 35:19.118
Yeah, sure.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.125
But there are a lot of things I
don't remember from those days.

35:28.096 --> 35:31.998
And I know that I sometimes, would...

35:32.851 --> 35:34.800
leave you to go out and score drugs.

35:36.971 --> 35:39.138
So, as much as I hate to say it,

35:39.140 --> 35:41.307
I probably did what you said.

35:43.144 --> 35:45.111
I probably left you alone overnight.

35:48.283 --> 35:51.033
Just add it to the list of things
that I'll never be forgiven for.

35:52.987 --> 35:54.153
No.

35:54.155 --> 35:55.905
No, that's...

35:55.957 --> 35:57.156
That's not why I brought it up.

35:58.293 --> 36:01.961
I don't want you to beat
yourself up over it, I just...

36:03.998 --> 36:05.998
I just needed to know that you knew.

36:08.836 --> 36:11.254
I just wish there was
something I could do.

36:11.306 --> 36:13.005
I don't know, just...

36:13.007 --> 36:14.924
some way that I could

36:14.976 --> 36:16.809
make it up to you and your brother.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.180
Just take good care of Bella.

36:23.067 --> 36:24.934
That's enough.

36:24.986 --> 36:26.068
I promise.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.999
MEDIC: Coming through.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.877
Call me, okay? You don't
need to be doing this.

37:02.140 --> 37:03.889
(Sighs)

37:03.942 --> 37:05.224
I'm sorry.

37:06.861 --> 37:09.812
I never meant to get
Callie all mixed up in this.

37:09.864 --> 37:12.064
Yeah, I know. I know.

37:14.118 --> 37:17.236
At least now Russell can't
hurt you anymore, huh?

37:17.288 --> 37:21.123
We got you a bed at
Children of the Night.

37:21.159 --> 37:23.209
Home for girls trying
to get out of the life.

37:23.244 --> 37:26.162
Margo here will take you, just uh...

37:26.214 --> 37:28.798
We hope that you'll give it a chance.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.053
You ready?

37:41.062 --> 37:42.228
Thank you.

37:58.162 --> 38:00.112
(Police Radio Chatter)

38:23.971 --> 38:25.938
Troy Johnson confessed.

38:29.193 --> 38:30.810
What?

38:32.864 --> 38:34.897
He confessed to Martha's murder.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.239
What...

38:44.876 --> 38:46.075
Um... what does that mean?

38:48.830 --> 38:50.913
I don't know. I don't know.

38:50.965 --> 38:53.999
Hopefully it means that you'll
get your case dismissed, Callie.

38:57.255 --> 39:01.006
But you know, you almost didn't
stay alive long enough to find out.

39:07.932 --> 39:09.181
What's it gonna take, Callie?

39:09.183 --> 39:12.101
What's it gonna take for you
to start valuing your life?

39:16.240 --> 39:18.074
It's just, I don't know...

39:19.994 --> 39:22.027
what else to do, I don't...

39:24.916 --> 39:26.999
One of these days you're
not going to be so lucky

39:27.034 --> 39:29.201
and I'm not gonna be
able to just take you home

39:29.253 --> 39:31.871
because they're gonna be
taking your body to the morgue.
