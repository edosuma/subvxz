00:09.336 --> 00:12.963
Testing. Testing. One.
Two. Three. Testing.

00:15.243 --> 00:16.227
Damn it!

00:16.228 --> 00:18.306
Hank, careful with that, man.

00:18.307 --> 00:19.059
Sorry, man.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.550
Yo, here it is!

00:20.551 --> 00:22.330
- What?
- The review from last night's show.

00:22.331 --> 00:23.267
Do we want to hear it?

00:23.268 --> 00:24.952
Only if you like being
called the next Nirvana.

00:24.953 --> 00:26.180
Yeah, right.

00:26.181 --> 00:27.659
Dude, he's not kidding.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.573
"Holy Shemp's future is now.

00:29.574 --> 00:30.970
"They're about to
explode, just like

00:30.971 --> 00:33.819
one of singer Keith Blue's
signature screams."

00:33.820 --> 00:35.712
Yeah!

00:35.713 --> 00:38.895
Whoo! Did you hear that?
We're taking off, baby!

00:38.896 --> 00:41.073
Hey, hey, where's James?
They're comparing him to The Edge.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.345
Uh, he's probably still asleep.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.047
Let's go wake his ass up!

00:45.104 --> 00:46.372
Is this real?

00:46.373 --> 00:47.924
Jimmy!

00:47.925 --> 00:49.179
Come on. This is gonna be good.

00:49.637 --> 00:52.095
Wakey, wakey, Jimbo.
I'm coming in with a camera.

00:52.096 --> 00:52.797
Come on.

00:54.686 --> 00:55.649
Come on.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.227
I seriously hope his junk is
not flapping in the breeze

00:58.228 --> 00:58.822
like last time.

00:58.823 --> 00:59.622
Come on.

01:04.489 --> 01:06.964
Help! Help!

01:06.965 --> 01:09.574
Help me! Help me!

01:23.704 --> 01:25.055
Ryan, get rid of the cameras.

01:25.056 --> 01:27.141
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

01:27.142 --> 01:30.137
Hey, officer, we need
to lose these cameras.

01:30.138 --> 01:31.821
You know that. No press allowed.

01:31.822 --> 01:34.434
Uh, they're not press.
They're shooting some kind of movie.

01:34.435 --> 01:37.220
No, they're...they're filming a
documentary about the band.

01:37.406 --> 01:38.188
And you are?

01:38.189 --> 01:39.798
I'm...I'm Hank Rogers.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.592
I'm one of the roadies.

01:41.593 --> 01:42.809
You knew the victim.
All right.

01:42.810 --> 01:44.445
Well, I'm gonna need
a statement, okay?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.785
Are you kidding me?
They're in here, too?

01:46.786 --> 01:47.887
I asked them to leave,

01:47.888 --> 01:50.366
but he said that the director
told him to shoot all this.

01:50.367 --> 01:52.215
How'd you like to try to film
with a cracked lens, huh?

01:52.216 --> 01:52.975
- All right.
- Huh?

01:52.976 --> 01:54.211
Espo, just go get
their director.

01:54.212 --> 01:55.966
Tell him to get the
crew out of here.

01:56.136 --> 01:57.199
Hey, Esposito.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.212
Someone didn't get their coffee.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.653
What's this?

02:01.654 --> 02:04.088
They are making a
documentary on the band.

02:04.089 --> 02:05.573
Yeah, just ignore 'em.

02:07.062 --> 02:09.223
Richard Castle, novelist.

02:09.225 --> 02:11.721
My latest, "Frozen
Heat," in stores now.

02:11.722 --> 02:14.238
Have you met, uh, Nikki
Heat's inspiration...

02:14.239 --> 02:15.215
Detective Beckett?

02:15.216 --> 02:16.464
Lanie, what else do we know?

02:16.465 --> 02:17.902
Victim is James Swan.

02:17.903 --> 02:20.224
He's the lead guitarist
of Holy Shemp.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.050
They must be Three Stooges fans.

02:22.051 --> 02:23.652
Based on lividity,

02:23.653 --> 02:28.547
I'd say the time of death is
between 12:00 and 2:00 AM.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.927
Look at that.

02:29.928 --> 02:31.144
"Observe."

02:31.145 --> 02:33.520
An unheeded call to vigilance.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.932
So that's the murder weapon.

02:34.933 --> 02:37.030
Mm. It's a Gibson Les Paul.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.929
59 flame top if
I'm not mistaken,

02:38.930 --> 02:41.636
and I'm rarely mistaken.

02:44.818 --> 02:45.792
That's hot.

02:46.152 --> 02:47.195
Tell me about this guitar.

02:47.196 --> 02:49.240
Well, the flame top
is his favorite.

02:49.241 --> 02:50.556
Uh, last night after the show,

02:50.557 --> 02:53.272
I tuned it and I dropped
it off at his trailer.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.844
He likes to compose on it.

02:54.845 --> 02:56.971
All right.
Uh, what time was that at?

02:57.205 --> 02:58.625
It was around 11:30.

02:58.626 --> 03:01.177
All right.
Was, uh, he alone at the time?

03:01.178 --> 03:02.458
Yeah. Yeah.

03:02.459 --> 03:04.247
We chatted for a second.

03:04.248 --> 03:05.758
He's always really nice to me.

03:06.471 --> 03:07.892
It was all about the
music with him.

03:07.893 --> 03:10.501
Was there, uh, anyone hanging
outside the trailer,

03:10.502 --> 03:12.698
maybe someone you
didn't recognize?

03:13.123 --> 03:14.639
I saw a white van.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.670
It went around the block
a couple of times.

03:16.671 --> 03:18.111
Oh, did you get a plate number?

03:18.112 --> 03:19.377
I'm sorry.

03:19.378 --> 03:20.607
It was dark.

03:20.608 --> 03:22.925
All right.
Um, don't go anywhere.

03:25.470 --> 03:26.268
Yeah. No, I...

03:26.269 --> 03:27.421
you can't pull your funding.

03:27.422 --> 03:29.353
Yo. You the director?

03:29.354 --> 03:31.465
Yeah. Yeah, no.

03:31.466 --> 03:34.188
You...look, we are sitting
on gold here. Okay?

03:34.189 --> 03:36.232
This is part rock doc part, uh...

03:36.233 --> 03:37.253
This is a crime scene.

03:37.254 --> 03:38.955
You gotta get these
cameras outta here.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.483
All right.

03:40.484 --> 03:41.698
Look, I-I gotta go.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.808
Just call me if...if you
can get that thing.

03:44.781 --> 03:46.932
Look, you gotta help
me out here, okay?

03:46.933 --> 03:50.021
I-I've been following these
guys nonstop for three months.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.062
Not anymore.
Police procedure. Sorry.

03:52.063 --> 03:53.926
And if you've been
following the victim 24/7,

03:53.927 --> 03:55.340
I'm gonna need to
see that footage.

03:55.341 --> 03:56.783
Look, Detective.

03:57.801 --> 04:01.152
Look... I'm in a spot here.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.776
Okay, James Swan...

04:03.777 --> 04:05.394
was that band.

04:05.395 --> 04:08.320
With him gone, no one is
gonna care about these guys

04:08.321 --> 04:09.945
or want to see this film.

04:09.946 --> 04:13.476
So unless I can reinvent it
as some kind of thriller,

04:13.477 --> 04:14.946
you know, a hunt
for the murderer...

04:14.947 --> 04:16.587
people love that stuff.

04:16.776 --> 04:19.470
Listen to me, a guy's dead here.

04:19.471 --> 04:20.694
So if you don't get
rid of these cameras,

04:20.695 --> 04:21.634
I'm gonna break one over your...

04:21.635 --> 04:23.896
One second. Sorry.
Yeah, go ahead.

04:24.185 --> 04:25.918
Oh, great.

04:25.919 --> 04:26.613
Okay, hang on.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.543
I'm gonna give you to a detective.
Yeah.

04:36.436 --> 04:37.630
Hello.

04:37.631 --> 04:39.838
This was a crime of passion.

04:39.839 --> 04:41.798
There was an argument,
things got heated,

04:41.799 --> 04:43.858
the killer grabbed the
nearest heavy object,

04:43.859 --> 04:46.135
and felled poor Mr. Swan

04:46.136 --> 04:47.896
at the tragically young age of...

04:48.435 --> 04:49.290
How old was he?

04:49.291 --> 04:50.493
27.

04:50.494 --> 04:52.910
Wow. Another one for the club.

04:52.911 --> 04:53.695
What club?

04:53.696 --> 04:54.904
The 27 club.

04:54.905 --> 04:57.509
Memberships include
some of the greats...

04:57.510 --> 04:59.966
Jimi Hendrix, Jim
Morrison, Janis Joplin.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.340
The list is extensive.

05:01.341 --> 05:03.011
Castle, we kind of
need a different list,

05:03.012 --> 05:06.198
like who might have been in
this trailer last night.

05:07.337 --> 05:08.548
I think I know where to start.

05:08.549 --> 05:09.295
Lanie.

05:13.942 --> 05:15.610
Go, go, go, go.
Get outta here.

05:25.289 --> 05:27.324
Oh, my God. Thank you.

05:29.592 --> 05:31.771
The guy was a total genius.

05:31.772 --> 05:34.176
I followed the band
for six months

05:34.177 --> 05:35.693
trying to meet him.

05:35.694 --> 05:38.314
A couple weeks ago, James
and I got together,

05:38.315 --> 05:39.171
and every night since,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.631
I'd meet him in his trailer
right after the show.

05:44.757 --> 05:46.879
So you were in his trailer
when it happened?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.842
I guess. I mean, I, um,

05:48.843 --> 05:50.382
I-I don't remember anything.

05:50.383 --> 05:50.951
I'm sorry.

05:50.952 --> 05:53.479
How can you not remember?

05:53.480 --> 05:55.082
I passed out.

05:55.884 --> 05:57.290
I guess I...

05:57.853 --> 06:00.430
partied a little too
hard during the show.

06:00.431 --> 06:02.042
I'm sorry. I want to help.

06:02.043 --> 06:03.896
- Listen, Miss...
- Butterfly.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.597
Butterfly, this is
very important.

06:06.598 --> 06:09.501
Do you remember anything
about that night?

06:09.502 --> 06:11.035
Anything at all?

06:13.447 --> 06:15.323
In his trailer...

06:15.948 --> 06:17.521
I heard a horse.

06:17.522 --> 06:18.470
Um...

06:19.270 --> 06:21.176
A horse as in whinnying?

06:21.177 --> 06:21.872
No.

06:21.873 --> 06:25.074
I heard the sound
of horse hooves

06:25.075 --> 06:26.580
crunching in the snow.

06:26.581 --> 06:30.231
Like, crunch, crunch, crunch...

06:30.232 --> 06:33.086
Okay, can we, uh, just
focus on what happened

06:33.087 --> 06:34.764
just before you passed out?

06:34.765 --> 06:36.374
Did he seem like he was upset?

06:36.375 --> 06:38.025
Did he seem like he had
been fighting with anyone?

06:38.026 --> 06:39.339
Actually, the opposite.

06:39.340 --> 06:40.768
He'd been complaining a lot

06:40.769 --> 06:42.745
about the other guys
in the band recently,

06:42.746 --> 06:46.462
you know, the...the
arguments and the tension.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.037
But last night,

06:51.070 --> 06:53.552
he...he seemed happy, you know?

06:53.553 --> 06:57.099
Like...like he'd found
some kind of peace.

06:57.706 --> 06:59.582
I don't know if that girl
could swing a guitar

06:59.583 --> 07:00.863
with enough force
to kill anyone,

07:00.864 --> 07:02.904
but I still gotta check her
clothes for blood spatter.

07:02.905 --> 07:04.478
I'm more interested in
what the band members

07:04.479 --> 07:05.478
were fighting about.

07:05.479 --> 07:07.423
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
Huh?

07:07.424 --> 07:09.461
Get outta here now.
This is a police investigation.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.911
You have no right to be here.

07:10.912 --> 07:14.488
Uh, actually, that's not true.

07:20.726 --> 07:23.120
I'm sorry, Detective, but
it's out of my hands.

07:23.121 --> 07:26.369
- City hall has decided it's good PR.
- Wait. What about the case?

07:26.370 --> 07:27.515
They're gonna compromise
the investig...

07:27.516 --> 07:29.393
I feel the same way as you do,

07:29.394 --> 07:31.049
but a decision has been made,

07:31.050 --> 07:32.898
and I expect you
to comply with it.

07:32.899 --> 07:35.499
Fine. Then just have
them stay out of my way.

07:38.399 --> 07:42.149
Hi. Uh... welcome.

07:42.150 --> 07:43.698
I'm Captain Gates,

07:43.699 --> 07:45.438
head of the 12th precinct.

07:45.439 --> 07:49.505
In cooperation with the NYPD's
Public Affairs division,

07:49.506 --> 07:53.302
I am happy to grant you full
access to the department.

07:53.303 --> 07:55.729
I think you will
find everyone here

07:55.730 --> 07:58.584
more than accommodating.

08:11.609 --> 08:12.535
Welcome.

08:13.637 --> 08:14.538
Welcome.

08:14.539 --> 08:15.979
Come on.
What's the big deal?

08:15.980 --> 08:16.779
It'll be fun.

08:16.780 --> 08:20.188
Look, Castle, what I do here,
this is... mine.

08:20.415 --> 08:22.840
And just because they want
to invade my privacy,

08:22.841 --> 08:25.171
it doesn't mean that I
have to help them do it.

08:26.435 --> 08:27.823
Okay. Well, that may be.

08:27.824 --> 08:31.534
But... these cameras,
they're not going anywhere.

08:31.535 --> 08:33.148
They're gonna see something.

08:33.375 --> 08:36.687
I just want them
to see what I see.

08:37.855 --> 08:39.332
Hold on.
Why do you need our alibis?

08:39.332 --> 08:41.774
Because we understand that
there was some tension

08:41.775 --> 08:43.571
between Mr. Swan and the band.

08:43.572 --> 08:44.472
Of course there was tension.

08:44.473 --> 08:46.612
You spend every second together,
it's not always gonna be pretty.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.098
We've been together
for five years.

08:48.099 --> 08:50.146
Like, if you had any
idea the kind of crap

08:50.147 --> 08:52.340
that you go through trying to
make it in this business.

08:52.341 --> 08:54.159
It has a way of bonding people.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.893
Or making them really,
really sick of each other.

08:55.894 --> 08:57.558
Hey, we looked out for James.

08:57.559 --> 08:59.061
He was a middle-class
kid from Ohio.

08:59.062 --> 09:01.201
He didn't know what the hell he
was getting into with this life.

09:01.428 --> 09:04.116
Yeah. Well, we're still
gonna need statements

09:04.117 --> 09:06.162
about where you were last night.

09:06.692 --> 09:08.216
Fine. I was in my trailer.

09:08.217 --> 09:10.134
- I went there right after the show.
- Me, too.

09:10.135 --> 09:11.380
We were all in our trailers.

09:11.381 --> 09:12.409
All right, well, we have reports

09:12.410 --> 09:14.074
that there was a white
van in the area.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.774
Did James ever mention
anything about that?

09:15.775 --> 09:16.903
No.

09:18.194 --> 09:19.622
But he did think someone
was following him.

09:19.623 --> 09:21.273
Yeah, uh, it was a month ago.

09:21.274 --> 09:22.481
Right around the time
we played Ithaca.

09:22.482 --> 09:24.030
He w...he was acting
all paranoid.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.599
He was talking about
hiring extra security.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.987
Did he say who he was afraid of?

09:26.988 --> 09:29.556
No, but, um, he hadn't
brought it up recently,

09:29.557 --> 09:31.036
so I just assumed
everything was normal

09:31.037 --> 09:32.417
until he pulled that
stunt yesterday.

09:32.448 --> 09:33.802
- Yeah.
- What happened yesterday?

09:33.803 --> 09:35.715
He blew off our
1:00 band meeting.

09:35.926 --> 09:37.967
We didn't see him again
until sound check at 6:00.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.641
The guy never missed
a band meeting.

09:39.642 --> 09:41.000
Did he say where he was going?

09:41.001 --> 09:42.030
No.

09:42.031 --> 09:43.396
But I do know this,

09:43.397 --> 09:45.347
the camera guy that
was following him

09:45.348 --> 09:47.366
said that James ditched
him on purpose.

09:47.367 --> 09:50.659
So whatever he was doing, he
didn't want anyone to know.

09:51.396 --> 09:53.574
Yo. You guys got a sec?

09:55.056 --> 09:56.699
So, uh, I've been going through

09:56.700 --> 09:58.910
the documentary footage
of our victim.

09:58.911 --> 10:00.050
Check this out.

10:01.618 --> 10:02.815
Most guys will tell you that

10:02.816 --> 10:04.891
they, uh, they learned to
play guitar themselves.

10:04.892 --> 10:06.975
But I had a mentor.

10:06.976 --> 10:08.970
And...
and the guy was incredible.

10:08.971 --> 10:11.190
You...much better
than I'll ever be.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.894
What's he think of the band?

10:14.262 --> 10:16.146
You know, we lost
touch a ways back.

10:20.612 --> 10:22.384
There. You see that guy?

10:22.385 --> 10:23.815
That was taken over a month ago.

10:23.816 --> 10:25.088
These...

10:25.681 --> 10:27.462
are more recent.

10:28.498 --> 10:29.548
All right.

10:30.070 --> 10:32.055
B... just move back a bit.

10:32.056 --> 10:33.091
There we go.

10:33.381 --> 10:34.731
Boom. Boom.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.419
Boom. Boom.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.133
Yeah, it looks like our
vic had a stalker.

10:39.134 --> 10:40.276
Check out this one.

10:40.566 --> 10:42.307
This is from yesterday.

10:42.788 --> 10:44.273
Look what he's leaning against.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.185
A white van.

10:46.466 --> 10:48.701
We've got you now,
you son of a bitch.

10:52.428 --> 10:53.666
I'm sorry.
Can I even say son of a...

11:04.217 --> 11:06.068
So we blew up the picture
of the white van

11:06.069 --> 11:08.589
wide enough to get
a license plate.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.700
It's registered to an address
somewhere around here.

11:11.139 --> 11:11.935
Make a right up ahead.

11:11.936 --> 11:13.076
No, I'm going another way.

11:13.077 --> 11:14.347
What do you mean?
There's only one way.

11:14.348 --> 11:15.534
No, there's a different way.
There's a back way.

11:15.535 --> 11:16.176
There's no back way.

11:16.177 --> 11:17.706
Trust me. Trust me.

11:18.404 --> 11:19.647
I-I know how this might look,

11:19.648 --> 11:21.433
but we actually make
a pretty good team

11:21.434 --> 11:24.483
because we each have, uh,
different strengths.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.354
That's true.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.571
For example, I'm
former military,

11:27.572 --> 11:29.493
which makes me an
expert marksman.

11:29.494 --> 11:30.903
I'm usually first
through the door.

11:30.904 --> 11:33.696
Well, yeah, but somebody's gotta
know which door to go through.

11:33.697 --> 11:36.614
I'm a little bit more,
um, circumspect,

11:36.615 --> 11:37.986
uh, than my partner here.

11:37.987 --> 11:39.977
I'm kinda like the...the
nerve center of the team.

11:39.978 --> 11:41.623
But I'm definitely
the physical one.

11:41.624 --> 11:42.763
I stay in sick shape.

11:42.942 --> 11:44.497
Boom.
Have you been to the gun show?

11:44.498 --> 11:45.436
I'm just kidding.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.221
I'm just...seriously,
though, I'm in sick shape.

11:47.222 --> 11:48.925
Dude, what's with the shirt?

11:48.926 --> 11:50.401
It's really tight.
Did you change it?

11:50.402 --> 11:52.565
I... I spilled something on it.

11:54.111 --> 11:56.530
Ah, here it is.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.655
Slow approach.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.677
Stay close.

12:14.979 --> 12:16.463
I think he saw us.

12:21.985 --> 12:23.185
I got this.

12:31.147 --> 12:32.399
Let's go check out the van.

12:39.124 --> 12:40.786
What do we have here?

12:41.212 --> 12:42.490
Uh-oh.

12:44.941 --> 12:46.479
Pretty sure that ain't ketchup.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.951
Hey, is that our stalker?

12:47.952 --> 12:49.468
Ex-stalker.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.219
He won't be seeing
daylight any time soon.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.462
Uh, LT, could you
please take him

12:52.463 --> 12:53.954
to an interrogation room?
Thank you.

12:53.955 --> 12:55.231
You should watch
from observation

12:55.232 --> 12:57.032
while I tear this guy apart.

12:57.706 --> 12:59.884
So, uh, we like this guy?

12:59.885 --> 13:01.746
We found bloodstained
overalls in his van.

13:01.747 --> 13:02.780
We sent 'em to be tested

13:02.781 --> 13:04.384
to see if they match the
blood from our vic.

13:04.385 --> 13:06.768
Oh, they match. Trust me, bro.

13:06.769 --> 13:07.963
You won't have to worry
about this creep

13:07.964 --> 13:09.360
hurting anyone ever again.

13:09.361 --> 13:11.021
That's a gift from me to you.

13:11.022 --> 13:12.857
You're welcome, America.

13:17.064 --> 13:17.910
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:17.911 --> 13:19.531
A lot of nasty things
in your van, Joe...

13:19.532 --> 13:20.662
- I miss anything?
- Duct tape...

13:20.663 --> 13:21.585
No.
They're just getting started.

13:21.586 --> 13:23.838
- Rope, gasoline.
- Hey.

13:23.839 --> 13:26.500
You wanted to do nasty
things to James Swan.

13:26.501 --> 13:27.740
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.107
Oh, I think you do.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.691
I'm gonna give you a second...

13:31.651 --> 13:33.207
to get your facts straight.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.968
Ooh, the time-out.
That's a classic.

13:35.969 --> 13:39.315
Interrogation, it's
really an art form.

13:39.461 --> 13:41.831
I mean, Detective Beckett
here, she is a master.

13:41.832 --> 13:44.588
I have watched her
crack countless cases

13:44.589 --> 13:45.842
in this very room.

13:45.843 --> 13:47.809
You remember that guy
who killed his gardener

13:47.810 --> 13:49.480
because he cut his
roses too short?

13:51.222 --> 13:52.627
Found your overalls.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.753
They had Swan's
blood all over 'em.

13:54.754 --> 13:56.847
It's not his blood.
It's my blood.

13:57.089 --> 13:59.012
I cut myself when I was
working on my van.

13:59.013 --> 14:01.462
Oh, come on, Joe.
What, do you think we're stupid?

14:01.896 --> 14:05.094
We've got you on video
following him for weeks.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.802
We've got your van
at the crime scene.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.922
So why don't you cut the
innocent crap right now!

14:11.117 --> 14:12.945
You want me to admit it?
I admit it.

14:12.946 --> 14:14.886
I followed him. I did.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.817
I was just planning to grab him.

14:16.818 --> 14:19.850
And that's when your
plan went sideways.

14:19.851 --> 14:22.093
You tried to drag
him to your van,

14:22.094 --> 14:23.045
but he didn't want to go.

14:23.046 --> 14:24.157
That's not how it happened.

14:24.158 --> 14:25.816
- And that's when you got mad...
- That's not how it happened!

14:25.817 --> 14:26.914
That's when you got mad

14:26.915 --> 14:28.982
and that's when you
busted his head open.

14:28.983 --> 14:30.497
I didn't kill anybody.

14:30.498 --> 14:31.880
I just...

14:32.560 --> 14:34.097
I just...

14:34.366 --> 14:36.872
I just want my little girl.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.427
Your little girl?

14:43.334 --> 14:44.557
My daughter.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.144
She quit her job to
become a groupie.

14:47.145 --> 14:48.666
Threw her whole life away.

14:49.506 --> 14:51.868
I was afraid she was
gonna get pregnant.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.105
Or worse.

14:55.977 --> 14:58.227
All I wanted to do was grab him.

14:58.228 --> 14:59.557
I wanted to scare him a little.

14:59.558 --> 15:01.614
I wanted him to
stay away from her.

15:01.544 --> 15:02.499
Your daughter?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.651
Yes.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.519
I haven't seen her in weeks.

15:06.702 --> 15:08.517
I don't even know
if she's alive.

15:09.238 --> 15:11.796
Does she go by the
name of Butterfly?

15:13.815 --> 15:14.786
Yes.

15:14.787 --> 15:17.221
I think we can
help you find her,

15:17.380 --> 15:19.432
if it's okay with my partner.

15:20.575 --> 15:23.129
Well, looks like our stalker
was telling the truth.

15:23.130 --> 15:27.224
Prelim shows that the blood
on his overalls was his.

15:27.225 --> 15:28.443
Sorry, partner.

15:28.444 --> 15:29.676
Huh.

15:29.677 --> 15:32.400
Well, at least grabbing the
guy up wasn't a total bust.

15:32.401 --> 15:35.082
I don't know. It seems to be the
definition of a total bust.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.831
Well, it would've been if hadn't
just spoken to him in holding.

15:37.832 --> 15:40.127
Seeing as how he was
tailing our victim,

15:40.128 --> 15:42.613
he knew exactly where Swan was
on the afternoon of his death.

15:42.614 --> 15:43.974
Great. Where?

15:43.975 --> 15:45.573
He was at a bank in SoHo
and then he went into

15:45.574 --> 15:46.422
a residential building

15:46.423 --> 15:48.365
on the corner of
Lafayette and Broome.

15:48.366 --> 15:49.820
Yes, but why?

15:49.821 --> 15:53.020
Swan eluded his cameraman to
go on a clandestine errand,

15:53.021 --> 15:56.417
an errand so important,
he missed a band meeting.

15:56.418 --> 15:59.007
He was acting erratically, went
to the bank right beforehand.

15:59.008 --> 16:00.423
This all points to one thing.

16:00.424 --> 16:01.527
- Drugs.
- Dr-drugs.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.484
That's an interesting theory,

16:02.485 --> 16:04.044
but that is pure speculation.

16:04.045 --> 16:05.120
Actually, it's not.

16:05.121 --> 16:07.591
Pure speculation would
be Swan purchasing

16:07.592 --> 16:08.802
thermonuclear technology

16:08.803 --> 16:10.354
to have a scientist
make him an amplifier

16:10.355 --> 16:12.134
that went all the way to 12.

16:12.135 --> 16:13.282
This...

16:13.283 --> 16:15.113
musicians buying drugs...

16:15.114 --> 16:17.138
that's just Monday
morning crossword.

16:19.783 --> 16:22.863
I'll pull a list of tenants,
see if anyone pops.

16:23.613 --> 16:25.682
Lanie's got something
she wants us to see.

16:25.683 --> 16:27.336
Lanie. Who's Lanie?

16:29.556 --> 16:31.048
Uh...

16:31.347 --> 16:34.528
Uh, Lanie is our
medical examiner.

16:34.529 --> 16:36.456
And she works at the morgue.

16:36.457 --> 16:40.061
And she's got information
that she wants us to see,

16:40.062 --> 16:41.738
and we are keeping her waiting.

16:43.129 --> 16:45.241
- Still a little stiff.
- Certainly, she could tighten that up,

16:45.242 --> 16:46.575
but she's getting better.

16:46.576 --> 16:48.343
The victim's blood
panels came back.

16:48.344 --> 16:49.470
Let me guess.

16:49.568 --> 16:50.629
Drugs.

16:50.630 --> 16:54.996
Nope. This was one
clean-living rock star.

16:54.997 --> 16:58.636
In fact, it's not what
he put in his body,

16:58.637 --> 16:59.925
it's what he didn't.

16:59.926 --> 17:02.892
James had no
antibodies for polio.

17:02.893 --> 17:04.746
He never had the polio vaccine?

17:04.747 --> 17:07.950
Wait. Everyone born since the
early 1960s got that vaccine.

17:07.951 --> 17:08.829
That's what I thought.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.434
He also had no antibodies
for tetanus, measles,

17:11.435 --> 17:14.444
whooping cough... all
standard immunizations.

17:15.112 --> 17:16.182
What else?

17:16.422 --> 17:17.976
Isn't that enough?

17:17.977 --> 17:20.208
Lanie, usually if you have
something like this for me,

17:20.209 --> 17:22.243
you just call me over the phone.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.958
Well, I thought it
was worth the trip.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.372
Ryan, can you look into our
vic's medical records?

17:33.373 --> 17:36.305
I wanna find out why he
was never vaccinated.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.240
On it.

17:37.241 --> 17:38.879
Okay, I think I figured out

17:38.880 --> 17:40.958
why James Swan went
to that building.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.736
He knew a guy who lived
there... a Sam Spear.

17:43.737 --> 17:45.979
Dude has an outstanding
lawsuit against our vic.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.287
What kind of a lawsuit?

17:47.288 --> 17:48.555
Well, he claims that James

17:48.556 --> 17:49.885
stole one of the
band's songs from him,

17:49.886 --> 17:51.100
and James must have
thought he had a case,

17:51.101 --> 17:52.923
because when he
stopped at a bank

17:52.924 --> 17:54.091
on his way to see this guy,

17:54.092 --> 17:55.884
he took out 25 grand, cash.

17:55.885 --> 17:57.451
Sounds like he's trying
to settle out of court.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.089
Yeah, and I'm guessing
it didn't pan out.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.739
Sam Spear bought a ticket
to last night's show.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.575
So he was at the theater right
before Swan was killed.

18:04.576 --> 18:06.141
Time to pay this guy a visit.

18:06.142 --> 18:09.150
No. No, no, no.
I got this.

18:09.151 --> 18:10.950
You stay here and work on
your little research project,

18:10.951 --> 18:12.581
you being the nerve
center and all.

18:12.582 --> 18:13.852
Castle.

18:13.853 --> 18:14.695
Uh, you coming?

18:14.696 --> 18:16.282
No, I'm good.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.258
Wait up.

18:21.216 --> 18:22.906
It's not this one.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.334
Spear's in 3-M.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.512
You know, Detective Beckett
is not an unfriendly person.

18:29.513 --> 18:31.156
She's just got walls.

18:32.358 --> 18:35.103
Let's... let's call them layers.

18:35.104 --> 18:38.677
Layers upon layers
of uh, well, walls.

18:38.678 --> 18:40.818
But once you scale those walls...

18:40.819 --> 18:42.462
the effort is worth it.

18:42.463 --> 18:45.435
Castle.
Keep your voice down, please.

18:45.436 --> 18:47.823
All right. I've already had
one guy bolt on me today.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.430
Element of surprise is key.
See, I can be circumspect.

18:50.431 --> 18:52.129
Folks would be lost without me.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.708
He went the wrong way.

18:56.616 --> 18:58.672
Aah! Aah!

18:59.370 --> 19:01.015
It's 3-M. Spear's place.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.048
- Drop your weapon!
- You ready?

19:02.049 --> 19:03.598
Let her go right now...

19:03.599 --> 19:06.469
NYPD!
Nobody moves!

19:09.158 --> 19:10.828
- Get your hands up!
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:10.829 --> 19:11.864
Let me see your hands!

19:11.865 --> 19:13.284
What is this?

19:13.285 --> 19:14.871
Drop your weapon!

19:17.472 --> 19:18.918
It's just a bad movie.

19:18.919 --> 19:21.069
I'm just composing the score.

19:21.418 --> 19:22.504
This is all a misunderstanding.

19:22.505 --> 19:23.685
Let's review...

19:23.686 --> 19:26.095
you sued James Swan
over a song,

19:26.096 --> 19:28.003
and then he came to see
you about it yesterday.

19:28.004 --> 19:30.538
A few hours later, he was
killed right after his show.

19:30.539 --> 19:32.128
- What?
- A show that you attended.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.548
But we worked all that out.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.125
I...he was gonna give me half
the publishing for that song.

19:36.126 --> 19:37.376
I was gonna drop the complaint

19:37.377 --> 19:38.565
as soon as the
papers were signed.

19:38.566 --> 19:40.910
That doesn't explain the 25
grand he brought to you.

19:40.911 --> 19:44.036
25...I-I-I don't know
anything about that.

19:44.771 --> 19:46.234
Look, he wanted me
to write for him.

19:46.235 --> 19:47.323
It'd be pretty stupid

19:47.324 --> 19:49.391
to kill off an employer
in this job market.

19:49.392 --> 19:50.900
You were writing songs for him?

19:50.901 --> 19:53.271
Uh, yeah. Here. Uh, look.

19:54.286 --> 19:55.024
I-I already started.

19:55.025 --> 19:56.450
I got pretty far on that one.

19:56.451 --> 19:57.846
Let me see that.

19:58.773 --> 20:00.889
I do like the vocal
line on this.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.111
You read music?

20:03.112 --> 20:04.662
What, you think, because
I'm a cop, I can't sing?

20:04.663 --> 20:06.290
No, I think you can't sing
because I've heard you sing.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.628
That karaoke machine was busted.

20:07.629 --> 20:08.355
I'm gonna sing for y'all later.

20:08.356 --> 20:10.624
If this was just
about writing songs,

20:10.625 --> 20:11.625
why all the secrecy?

20:11.626 --> 20:13.844
He never said, but
I had my theories,

20:13.845 --> 20:15.160
especially because
this new stuff

20:15.161 --> 20:17.076
was such a musical
departure for him,

20:17.077 --> 20:18.042
as I'm sure you noticed.

20:18.043 --> 20:19.393
Yeah...just one sec.

20:19.394 --> 20:21.006
Taking the music in
a new direction,

20:21.007 --> 20:23.146
but he didn't want the
rest of the band to know.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.096
Of course.

20:25.097 --> 20:26.447
Swan was going solo.

20:26.448 --> 20:27.446
Makes sense.

20:27.447 --> 20:29.307
The director said that Swan
was the creative force

20:29.308 --> 20:30.133
behind the group,

20:30.134 --> 20:32.179
that if he left the band,
they would flounder.

20:32.180 --> 20:33.601
What if one of the other
members found out

20:33.602 --> 20:34.297
and confronted him?

20:34.298 --> 20:35.723
And they argued, and
things got ugly.

20:35.724 --> 20:37.312
Right. He wasn't about to stay.

20:37.313 --> 20:39.074
And they weren't about to
let him play George Michael

20:39.075 --> 20:40.191
to their Andrew Ridgeley.

20:40.192 --> 20:41.576
- Andrew who?
- Exactly.

20:41.577 --> 20:43.299
So they pick up a guitar...

20:43.300 --> 20:44.903
and wham!

20:47.768 --> 20:49.302
It's what I do.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.508
That's not bad.

20:50.509 --> 20:52.090
- It gives it weight.
- Yeah.

21:07.543 --> 21:09.259
* Those lips

21:09.293 --> 21:11.691
* those eyes

21:11.722 --> 21:15.682
* that smile was my demise

21:15.716 --> 21:19.128
* your mouth made promises

21:19.152 --> 21:23.402
* but your heart
was filled with lies *

21:23.434 --> 21:25.105
* lies

21:25.136 --> 21:29.128
* everything you said
was lies *

21:29.162 --> 21:31.430
* call me when you finish

21:31.448 --> 21:33.574
* lies

21:33.622 --> 21:37.707
* everything is always lies

21:37.746 --> 21:39.097
* wake up

21:41.491 --> 21:43.928
Got yourself a new guitarist.

21:44.321 --> 21:45.444
Trying someone out, yeah.

21:45.445 --> 21:46.801
Well, that was fast.

21:46.802 --> 21:48.236
Though I guess you
had this audition

21:48.237 --> 21:49.528
lined up already, didn't you?

21:49.529 --> 21:50.849
What are you talking about?

21:50.850 --> 21:52.100
Come on, Keith.

21:52.101 --> 21:53.964
You knew James was going solo.

21:55.126 --> 21:56.059
Is that true, man?

21:56.060 --> 21:57.403
No, of course not.
How would I know that?

21:57.404 --> 21:59.013
We met with a woman
from the record label.

21:59.014 --> 22:01.116
She says that she's
your girlfriend.

22:01.671 --> 22:03.665
She said that she had a
meeting on the books

22:03.666 --> 22:05.794
with James about
making some changes

22:05.795 --> 22:08.845
and that there were rumors that
he wanted to leave the band.

22:09.186 --> 22:12.494
All those years,
struggling side by side.

22:12.730 --> 22:15.691
And now success finally at hand,

22:15.692 --> 22:17.490
he wanted to take all
the glory for himself.

22:17.491 --> 22:19.116
I know I'd be mad.

22:19.687 --> 22:21.210
I'm not gonna stand here
and let you accuse me

22:21.211 --> 22:23.262
of killing one of my
best friends, all right?

22:27.851 --> 22:29.394
You hear that sound?

22:29.679 --> 22:32.561
Kind of like horse hooves
crunching on snow?

22:32.562 --> 22:35.557
Just like what Butterfly
heard in Swan's trailer.

22:36.498 --> 22:37.848
Look, we know he's got a temper,

22:37.849 --> 22:39.429
so if we can get
him angry enough...

22:39.430 --> 22:42.147
Actually, why don't you
talk to Keith yourself?

22:42.148 --> 22:42.875
Why?

22:42.876 --> 22:45.041
Because I want to give
you room to operate

22:45.121 --> 22:46.819
and strut your stuff.

22:49.033 --> 22:50.706
You got this.

22:52.063 --> 22:53.882
She's got this.

22:59.619 --> 23:01.010
Really, you gotta
film this, too?

23:01.011 --> 23:02.725
They can film whatever
they want, Keith.

23:02.726 --> 23:04.599
You signed a release.

23:05.821 --> 23:07.317
You're lucky the cameras
weren't rolling

23:07.318 --> 23:08.607
when you killed James Swan.

23:08.608 --> 23:10.343
Look, I already said,
I didn't kill him.

23:10.344 --> 23:11.437
Yeah, and you also said

23:11.438 --> 23:13.195
that you didn't know
that he was going solo

23:13.196 --> 23:15.044
and that you didn't see
him after the show,

23:15.045 --> 23:18.608
but I have a witness that
places you in his trailer

23:18.609 --> 23:20.701
at the time of death.

23:21.329 --> 23:23.184
All right, look, I did
go to his trailer. Okay?

23:23.185 --> 23:24.166
But it was like you said.

23:24.167 --> 23:25.338
I heard rumors that he
was cutting out on us.

23:25.339 --> 23:26.398
I went to see if it was true.

23:26.399 --> 23:28.230
And then after that,
you lost control.

23:28.231 --> 23:30.414
No, we just talked. Okay?

23:30.415 --> 23:32.226
And James denied it.
He said that he wasn't leaving.

23:32.227 --> 23:33.607
He said he was working
out something

23:33.608 --> 23:34.652
that'd be good for all of us.

23:34.653 --> 23:36.980
And what exactly was
this something?

23:37.753 --> 23:40.169
Look, I used to think
I knew that dude,

23:40.170 --> 23:41.845
but he hasn't been the
same since Ithaca.

23:41.846 --> 23:42.850
I am telling you,
something happened there.

23:42.851 --> 23:44.751
Keith, I'm not talking
about Ithaca.

23:44.752 --> 23:47.605
I am talking about what
happened in that trailer.

23:47.606 --> 23:49.025
We talked. I left.

23:49.026 --> 23:51.358
I went back to my trailer
for the rest of the night.

23:51.359 --> 23:53.643
I was with this girl.
You can ask her.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.429
What's her name?

23:55.649 --> 23:57.503
I don't remember her name.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.108
A phone number then?

23:59.109 --> 24:01.721
Anything so I can
get ahold of her?

24:01.726 --> 24:03.734
They come to me.

24:04.011 --> 24:06.875
Keith, you're gonna have to
do a lot better than that.

24:11.981 --> 24:13.885
Okay. All right.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.294
I may not remember her name...

24:18.150 --> 24:21.024
but I can prove that we
were together that night.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.569
Well, they were
together, all right.

24:28.709 --> 24:30.670
Tommy Lee's got
nothing on this guy.

24:30.671 --> 24:32.990
I like to check on the case
every once in a while.

24:32.991 --> 24:34.888
No point in chaining
myself to that desk

24:34.889 --> 24:37.239
when all the action
is right out here.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.508
You want action, check this.

24:38.509 --> 24:39.548
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:39.549 --> 24:42.488
This is inappropriate
workplace behavior.

24:42.489 --> 24:44.015
This is evidence, Sir.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.026
Our suspect's alibi
hinges on this.

24:46.027 --> 24:48.485
Oh. Oh.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.264
So does his story pan out?

24:50.265 --> 24:51.451
Yeah, it seems like he's covered

24:51.452 --> 24:52.941
for the entire
time-of-death window.

24:52.942 --> 24:55.512
I hope you're not going on the
time stamp on this video.

24:55.513 --> 24:57.299
That could be faked, you know?

24:57.300 --> 24:59.617
That's not the only thing
on this video being faked.

24:59.618 --> 25:01.192
TV's on in the background, Sir.

25:01.193 --> 25:02.497
And that is the
news, which means

25:02.498 --> 25:04.421
I can verify the time
stamp using that.

25:04.422 --> 25:05.519
Okay.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.622
Good job, everyone.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.794
Keep it up.

25:08.795 --> 25:11.028
No. Too easy.

25:11.029 --> 25:13.265
So it looks like we're
back to square one, huh?

25:13.266 --> 25:15.178
Well, I wouldn't say that.

25:15.179 --> 25:16.997
I was looking into our
vic's medical records...

25:16.998 --> 25:18.782
my little, uh, research project.

25:18.783 --> 25:21.226
Turns out, he has no records.

25:21.341 --> 25:24.944
Birth, medical, student
transcripts, nothing.

25:24.945 --> 25:26.693
The first time
James Swan pops up

25:26.694 --> 25:29.446
is when he was 17 when
he was hospitalized

25:29.447 --> 25:31.288
for a car accident
in Ithaca, New York.

25:31.289 --> 25:33.029
Why does Ithaca keep coming up?

25:33.030 --> 25:35.098
Because that's where he's from.

25:35.107 --> 25:37.299
I checked the address
in the ER records.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.301
Traced it to a 20-acre compound

25:39.302 --> 25:41.489
owned by the Church of
Worldly Enlightenment.

25:41.490 --> 25:43.154
Whoa, guys, wait a second.

25:43.155 --> 25:45.360
I've heard about this place.
It's a cult.

25:45.361 --> 25:47.077
That's why he doesn't
have any vaccinations

25:47.078 --> 25:48.497
and that's why he
doesn't have a family.

25:48.498 --> 25:49.632
He grew up in a cult.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.593
The only way to leave
was to escape.

25:51.594 --> 25:52.941
The compound is walled

25:52.942 --> 25:55.134
and the cult practices
strict obedience.

25:55.135 --> 25:57.985
Everyone tattoos the word
"Serve" on their forearm.

25:57.986 --> 25:59.542
"Serve."

25:59.628 --> 26:01.443
Remember James' tattoo?

26:01.738 --> 26:02.951
"Observe"?

26:02.952 --> 26:04.330
He must have added
the "O" and the "B"

26:04.331 --> 26:05.661
sometime after he got out.

26:05.662 --> 26:08.922
But when the band played Ithaca,
maybe somebody recognized him.

26:08.923 --> 26:09.757
Which is why he was afraid

26:09.758 --> 26:10.967
that someone was following him.

26:10.968 --> 26:12.523
James had reason to be afraid.

26:12.524 --> 26:14.610
John Campbell, the
cult's leader.

26:14.611 --> 26:17.273
The guy is a total psycho
with a violent past.

26:17.274 --> 26:18.533
He did ten years for murder

26:18.534 --> 26:20.685
before starting the
whole church scam.

26:20.686 --> 26:21.874
Do we know where
Campbell is now?

26:21.875 --> 26:23.408
Well, I can tell
you where he was.

26:23.409 --> 26:24.913
I checked passenger manifests...

26:24.914 --> 26:26.043
Let me see that.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.520
For all the nearby airports.

26:28.521 --> 26:30.905
He flew into JFK
two days ago.

26:31.064 --> 26:31.912
Yeah.

26:31.913 --> 26:34.620
Wait a second.
That's the day Swan died.

26:35.186 --> 26:38.026
So John Campbell was in town

26:38.625 --> 26:40.547
with a few days to kill.

26:41.922 --> 26:43.675
See what I did there?

26:43.907 --> 26:45.111
That was good.
Use that.

26:45.112 --> 26:46.394
Don't use the part where I
said, "See what I did there?"

26:46.395 --> 26:48.539
Cut that out.
Do a hard fade to black.

26:48.540 --> 26:49.563
Musical sting.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.046
Ba-da-da, ba-na-na-na...

26:56.664 --> 26:59.411
Hey. Are we close on
locating Campbell?

26:59.412 --> 27:01.900
Well, his picture is out to
all patrol cars citywide.

27:01.901 --> 27:04.586
And I've sent his photograph to
all the hotels in our database.

27:04.587 --> 27:06.472
Yeah, but the trouble
is, he uses aliases

27:06.473 --> 27:08.174
in order to stay off
the DEA's radar.

27:08.175 --> 27:09.661
Well, why's the DEA
interested?

27:09.662 --> 27:11.144
The Church of Worldly
Enlightenment

27:11.145 --> 27:13.354
isn't just your friendly
neighborhood cult.

27:13.355 --> 27:15.768
It's also a 20-acre pot farm,

27:15.769 --> 27:17.165
run by the 300-plus members,

27:17.166 --> 27:19.321
all for Campbell's
personal profit.

27:19.322 --> 27:20.688
Why don't the feds
shut him down?

27:20.689 --> 27:21.638
They've tried.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.803
Something about freedom
of religious expression.

27:23.804 --> 27:25.349
Can we get anything
else on the cult

27:25.350 --> 27:26.165
that can help us find him?

27:26.166 --> 27:28.715
Detective Beckett's working
an angle right now, Sir.

27:41.816 --> 27:42.672
Hey.

27:44.355 --> 27:44.997
Any luck?

27:44.998 --> 27:46.819
Yeah, I just got off the
phone with Cultwatch,

27:46.820 --> 27:48.033
and they're gonna hook
us up with someone else

27:48.034 --> 27:50.594
who escaped Campbell's compound.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.216
I was a kid,

27:55.549 --> 27:57.079
drifting.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.208
Campbell promised me meaning,

27:59.266 --> 28:01.338
a spiritual focus.

28:01.339 --> 28:03.969
But in return, he
took away everything.

28:03.970 --> 28:06.688
Uh, Caroline, are you worried
about these cameras,

28:06.689 --> 28:07.237
'cause if you want
to have them gone...

28:07.238 --> 28:09.025
No. Mnh-mnh.

28:09.717 --> 28:13.886
I want the world to know
what a monster this man is.

28:13.887 --> 28:16.334
How did Campbell react
when James Swan escaped?

28:16.335 --> 28:17.892
Oh, he was furious.

28:17.893 --> 28:19.443
He used to love James.

28:19.444 --> 28:21.458
That's why it was such a
betrayal when he left.

28:21.459 --> 28:23.700
I heard Campbell swear
he'd get revenge,

28:23.701 --> 28:25.517
no matter how long it took.

28:25.859 --> 28:28.192
Hey, guys, I think
I got something.

28:28.193 --> 28:29.710
The manager of the Widmark Hotel

28:29.711 --> 28:31.988
said that Campbell
checked in two days ago.

28:31.989 --> 28:32.772
Did you send a patrol car?

28:32.773 --> 28:34.197
He checked out the next morning.

28:34.198 --> 28:37.290
But guess who came to visit him
soon after he arrived there.

28:37.291 --> 28:38.576
James Swan.

28:38.577 --> 28:39.306
When?

28:39.307 --> 28:41.325
5:00 PM. The same night
that Swan was killed.

28:41.326 --> 28:43.784
He killed James.
I knew it.

28:43.785 --> 28:45.160
James was running from Campbell.

28:45.161 --> 28:47.056
Why would he agree
to meet with him?

28:47.057 --> 28:48.376
To buy his freedom.

28:48.377 --> 28:50.560
Let me guess. For $25,000?

28:50.561 --> 28:51.535
That's right.

28:51.587 --> 28:53.567
Do you have any idea where
we could find Campbell now?

28:53.568 --> 28:54.805
If he is in town,

28:54.806 --> 28:57.267
he might be at
this youth hostel.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.247
He recruits there.

28:59.248 --> 29:00.681
That's where I first met him.

29:00.682 --> 29:02.302
All right. Let's go get him.

29:14.452 --> 29:18.231
Excuse me. What are you doing?
What are these cameras for?

29:18.445 --> 29:20.296
We're looking for John Campbell.

29:23.787 --> 29:24.788
Um... no, sorry.

29:24.789 --> 29:26.364
There's no one
here by that name.

29:30.422 --> 29:32.028
Uh, excuse me.
That's a private room.

29:32.029 --> 29:34.542
And you can't go back there.
Excuse me.

29:34.543 --> 29:35.883
Mr. Campbell.

29:35.884 --> 29:38.148
We have a few questions
about James Swan.

29:41.374 --> 29:43.711
Mr. Campbell, where were you
between midnight and 2:00 AM

29:43.712 --> 29:46.032
the night that James
Swan was killed?

29:46.033 --> 29:48.126
I was in my hotel room.

29:48.127 --> 29:49.488
Can anyone vouch for that?

29:49.489 --> 29:50.925
Well, I was meditating.

29:50.926 --> 29:53.386
Solitude's a very important
part of my evening ritual.

29:53.387 --> 29:55.048
So that'd be a no.

29:55.049 --> 29:57.047
So what are you doing in town?

29:57.048 --> 29:58.765
Working for my church.

29:58.766 --> 30:01.246
Fund-raising, recruiting mostly.

30:01.247 --> 30:02.492
"Fund-raising"?

30:02.493 --> 30:04.404
Interesting term for
making James Swan

30:04.405 --> 30:05.623
pay you for his freedom.

30:06.393 --> 30:09.018
It's no secret that
James and I had met.

30:09.236 --> 30:11.102
But he certainly didn't
need to buy his freedom.

30:11.103 --> 30:11.954
We're all free.

30:11.955 --> 30:15.235
Mr. Campbell, we know that
James had 25 grand in cash

30:15.236 --> 30:16.893
with him when he
went to see you,

30:16.894 --> 30:19.610
and that he no longer had
that money once he left.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.588
James may have made a
donation to the church,

30:21.589 --> 30:24.695
but I make it a point not
to discuss those matters.

30:25.104 --> 30:28.432
Okay, so then why don't
we discuss Ithaca?

30:28.433 --> 30:32.010
About a month ago, James and
his band had a concert there.

30:32.011 --> 30:33.591
And he said that afterwards,
he was concerned

30:33.592 --> 30:34.900
that someone was
coming after him.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.901
Now I think that that
someone was you.

30:37.902 --> 30:41.038
I'm sorry, but I had no idea
James was in town last month.

30:41.039 --> 30:41.940
I don't think that's accurate.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.839
I think that you're upset
with him for cutting the cord

30:43.840 --> 30:44.714
with your church,

30:44.715 --> 30:46.456
- and so you started tracking him.
- That's not true.

30:46.457 --> 30:49.397
He gave you a donation so that
you would leave him alone.

30:49.398 --> 30:50.207
That's not true.

30:50.208 --> 30:52.338
But that wasn't enough, was it?
You wanted revenge.

30:52.339 --> 30:53.587
- No.
- So you followed him to his trailer...

30:53.588 --> 30:54.267
Enough.

30:54.268 --> 30:57.014
And then you killed
him in a fit of rage!

30:57.015 --> 30:58.210
Enough!

31:01.269 --> 31:02.873
Now if you have a
solid case here,

31:02.874 --> 31:04.352
then arrest me.

31:04.586 --> 31:06.255
Otherwise, we're done.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.445
You contact me again,

31:08.446 --> 31:11.238
and I will sue you for
religious persecution.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.325
Sir, we're sure
it was Campbell.

31:24.326 --> 31:25.127
He had motive,

31:25.128 --> 31:27.001
and he met with our victim
the day that he died.

31:27.002 --> 31:29.288
And he was lying through
his teeth about Ithaca.

31:29.289 --> 31:30.942
That's where Swan
got on his radar.

31:30.943 --> 31:32.092
Do you have any proof of that?

31:32.093 --> 31:32.915
No, not yet,

31:32.916 --> 31:35.156
but we're checking public
records and police reports

31:35.157 --> 31:36.605
from when the band was in Ithaca

31:36.606 --> 31:38.334
to see if there's a
link to Campbell.

31:38.335 --> 31:41.164
Well, I'm sure the DEA
will be delighted

31:41.165 --> 31:42.392
if you could help
get some infor...

31:43.388 --> 31:44.762
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.336
Gates.

31:49.034 --> 31:49.665
Oh.

31:49.666 --> 31:51.683
No, no, no.
DVDs will be fine.

31:52.858 --> 31:55.109
Well, I appreciate it,
Mr. Mitas.

31:55.291 --> 31:56.347
Okay.

31:58.564 --> 32:00.203
Our film director.

32:00.204 --> 32:02.302
As you know, it's important
that this project

32:02.303 --> 32:04.452
reflects well on the precinct.

32:05.005 --> 32:06.634
As I'm sure it will.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.177
But we did have

32:08.178 --> 32:10.995
a number of officers
watching a sex tape earlier.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.056
Still...

32:12.057 --> 32:14.424
to ensure that the
conduct of my people

32:14.425 --> 32:16.247
meets the highest
possible standard,

32:16.248 --> 32:18.704
Mr. Mitas is sending over
all the precinct footage

32:18.705 --> 32:19.599
for my review.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.394
All of the footage, Sir?

32:21.395 --> 32:22.807
Is there a problem, Detective?

32:22.808 --> 32:24.603
Yeah, no, no. Of course not.

32:24.744 --> 32:25.804
Okay.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.305
Well, she confirmed it.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.699
Well, that's the missing piece.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.319
You should tell Beckett.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.171
Unless you want to.

32:49.510 --> 32:50.212
Well...

32:50.374 --> 32:52.194
Uh, no, no.
You... you brought it home.

32:52.195 --> 32:55.346
Nah, but you were the one who
uncovered the whole cult thing.

32:55.347 --> 32:57.579
Right? I mean, this guy broke
the whole case wide open.

32:57.580 --> 32:59.236
Yeah, but this guy was the guy

32:59.237 --> 33:01.654
- who came up with the 25 grand, right?
- Yeah, but...

33:01.655 --> 33:03.047
Hey, Tango and Cash.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.695
Is there something you guys
want to tell us or not?

33:06.296 --> 33:08.027
- Do you wanna...
- Nah, go ahead.

33:08.028 --> 33:08.975
- All right.
- Yeah.

33:08.976 --> 33:10.073
Well, we were going
over police records

33:10.074 --> 33:11.434
for the night that our
vic was in Ithaca,

33:11.435 --> 33:12.468
but we found something else.

33:12.469 --> 33:14.943
A missing persons report
was filed by John Campbell

33:14.944 --> 33:17.036
the day after the
band left town.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.595
Someone went missing
from the cult?

33:18.596 --> 33:21.159
Yeah, a guy named Buck Cooper.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.695
We checked with Caroline
our Cultwatch contact.

33:23.696 --> 33:25.697
It turns out that Buck
was Swan's best friend

33:25.698 --> 33:27.188
from his days back in the cult.

33:27.189 --> 33:30.014
So that's what happened
in...in Ithaca.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.690
I mean, Swan went
back to the compound

33:32.691 --> 33:33.624
to break out his friend.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.243
That's the real reason
Campbell went after him.

33:35.244 --> 33:37.587
So the 25 grand wasn't
for Swan's freedom.

33:37.588 --> 33:38.905
It was for his friend's.

33:38.906 --> 33:42.010
This guy's testimony could
help us nail Campbell.

33:42.011 --> 33:43.750
We've been looking for him,
but he's not in the system.

33:43.751 --> 33:46.347
But Caroline was supposed
to send over a photo.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.441
There it is.

33:50.170 --> 33:53.421
Boom. Check it out.
We know that guy.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.367
It's the roadie I talked
to at the crime scene.

33:55.368 --> 33:56.669
Well, the key to
taking down Campbell

33:56.670 --> 33:58.487
has been under our
nose the whole time.

33:58.541 --> 34:01.026
I know I should've said
something earlier,

34:01.778 --> 34:03.893
it's just, James told me
to keep my head down,

34:03.894 --> 34:05.867
and then all of a
sudden, he was dead.

34:05.868 --> 34:07.148
And I didn't know what to do.

34:07.149 --> 34:09.065
It's okay, Buck.
You're safe now.

34:09.065 --> 34:10.327
I owe that man my life,

34:10.328 --> 34:12.574
and now I'm never gonna get
a chance to repay him.

34:13.574 --> 34:16.368
Actually, you... you
might be able to.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.400
You could help us nail
Campbell for his death.

34:20.706 --> 34:22.329
I wish I could, ma'am.

34:23.411 --> 34:26.129
Lord knows, that man's
done some terrible things.

34:26.536 --> 34:28.949
The trouble is, killing
James isn't one of 'em.

34:30.681 --> 34:32.668
When Campbell took the
money from James,

34:32.670 --> 34:35.032
he promised not to
bother us anymore.

34:35.166 --> 34:36.665
I needed to hear that myself.

34:36.666 --> 34:38.904
I needed to look
him in the eyes.

34:39.193 --> 34:41.251
You were with Campbell
when James was killed.

34:41.252 --> 34:42.982
So then Campbell couldn't
have killed James.

34:42.983 --> 34:44.297
But then who did?

34:44.297 --> 34:46.094
I wish I knew.

34:48.619 --> 34:51.675
Did he say anything to you
when you were in his trailer?

34:51.676 --> 34:55.687
He said that he was ready to
make things right for me.

34:55.998 --> 34:58.632
Uh... make things right?

34:58.633 --> 35:00.269
Didn't he already do that?

35:00.270 --> 35:01.569
Yeah, I thought so.

35:01.570 --> 35:04.677
James got me out of the cult.
James got me away from Campbell.

35:04.678 --> 35:06.836
He even gave me a
job in his band.

35:07.366 --> 35:08.732
All I ever did for the guy

35:08.733 --> 35:11.017
was teach him how
to play guitar.

35:11.548 --> 35:13.215
You were his teacher?

35:14.974 --> 35:15.930
Most guys will tell you

35:15.931 --> 35:17.437
they learned to play
guitar themselves,

35:17.438 --> 35:20.252
but I had a mentor, and...

35:20.253 --> 35:21.845
and the guy was incredible.

35:21.846 --> 35:23.602
You...much better
than I'll ever be.

35:23.603 --> 35:25.082
What's he think of the band?

35:28.159 --> 35:30.321
You know, we lost
touch a ways back.

35:30.611 --> 35:32.240
And, uh...

35:33.052 --> 35:35.026
sometimes I wonder
what he's up to.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.700
Don't you see?

35:39.334 --> 35:41.249
Everything we need
to solve this murder

35:41.250 --> 35:44.055
is right there in that clip.

35:44.056 --> 35:45.334
Do a hard fade to black.

35:45.335 --> 35:46.323
Musical sting.

35:52.814 --> 35:55.488
Buck Cooper was James Swan's
musical mentor, right?

35:55.489 --> 35:58.351
That's why, when the filmmaker
asked James about his past,

35:58.352 --> 36:01.317
he automatically thought of
his good friend Buck Cooper

36:01.318 --> 36:02.721
and how much he owed him.

36:02.722 --> 36:05.102
Which is when he decided to
rescue Buck from the compound

36:05.103 --> 36:06.381
and bring him on tour.

36:06.382 --> 36:08.388
But Buck as a roadie
didn't seem fitting.

36:08.389 --> 36:10.313
I mean, he was a better
musician than James was,

36:10.314 --> 36:11.376
by James' own account.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.295
That's what James meant

36:12.296 --> 36:14.170
when he told Buck he wanted
to make things right.

36:14.171 --> 36:16.010
He was talking about
bringing Buck into the band.

36:16.011 --> 36:17.277
Exactly.

36:17.278 --> 36:20.273
That was the change in direction
he kept talking about.

36:20.274 --> 36:22.614
It's why he told Keith it would
be good for all of them,

36:22.615 --> 36:24.398
because Buck is a
great musician.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.532
Only Swan didn't really
mean all of them,

36:26.533 --> 36:30.018
because if Buck was in, then
someone else was out. But who?

36:30.204 --> 36:31.966
Esposito, do you still
have that sheet music

36:31.967 --> 36:33.617
that, uh, Swan commissioned
from the songwriter?

36:33.618 --> 36:34.685
It's right here.

36:34.686 --> 36:35.811
Perfect.

36:35.812 --> 36:37.509
Working on the song a little.

36:37.510 --> 36:39.418
See, these aren't
run-of-the-mill power chords.

36:39.419 --> 36:41.363
You'd have to be pretty
good to play th...

36:42.683 --> 36:44.647
Especially this part.

36:52.573 --> 36:54.192
Yeah, I can play that.

36:54.193 --> 36:55.818
That's good news, Zeke.

36:55.819 --> 36:59.038
Because we just so happen
to have your bass guitar...

37:00.110 --> 37:01.594
right here.

37:01.805 --> 37:02.959
That's right in my face.
A little lower.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.351
Thank you, LT.

37:26.255 --> 37:28.114
All right. Fine.
I can't play it.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.004
That doesn't prove anything.

37:30.005 --> 37:31.099
No.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.673
But this does.

37:33.522 --> 37:36.107
This is a dry cleaning ticket
that we found in your trailer

37:36.108 --> 37:38.541
for clothes that you
dropped off yesterday.

37:38.839 --> 37:42.494
There are still flecks of
James Swan's blood on them.

37:51.854 --> 37:52.806
Do you know what it's like

37:52.807 --> 37:55.340
to play all those
crappy street fairs,

37:55.341 --> 37:56.446
live on nothing but
ramen noodles,

37:56.447 --> 37:58.484
sleep in a van for 14 months?

37:58.485 --> 38:00.605
And then he calls me to his
trailer after the show

38:00.606 --> 38:02.745
and tells me that I'm out?

38:03.043 --> 38:03.586
I admit,

38:03.587 --> 38:05.996
I might not be the world's
greatest bass player, but...

38:05.997 --> 38:07.876
No, but you sure can
handle a guitar.

38:07.877 --> 38:10.194
Oh, come on, man!
I didn't mean to kill him.

38:10.405 --> 38:11.714
We're finally about
to hit it big,

38:11.715 --> 38:13.786
and he wants to "Pete Best" me

38:13.898 --> 38:15.816
for some roadie?!

38:15.935 --> 38:16.632
I just...

38:16.633 --> 38:19.864
Ugh! I just lost it!

38:19.865 --> 38:22.627
Ugh! God!

38:22.831 --> 38:24.124
No.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.247
You know, Pete Best
was a drummer.

38:30.649 --> 38:34.177
I think Stu Sutcliffe would've
been a more apt comparison.

38:36.504 --> 38:39.589
I really appreciate what
you guys did for James.

38:39.870 --> 38:42.727
And I'm always gonna
appreciate that

38:42.728 --> 38:45.462
and... I know he does, too.

38:47.851 --> 38:49.288
You know, I, uh...

38:50.095 --> 38:51.486
have something for you.

38:52.718 --> 38:55.256
I think James would've
wanted you to have it.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.461
The bassline is a little tricky,

38:57.462 --> 38:59.483
but I think you might
be able to handle it.

39:00.831 --> 39:01.773
Hey.

39:02.796 --> 39:04.743
So it's true about Zeke?

39:04.744 --> 39:06.483
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

39:07.753 --> 39:09.542
This has not been a good week.

39:09.644 --> 39:11.288
Hey, um,

39:12.001 --> 39:16.142
I wanted to let you know, uh, we
need a new bassist, obviously,

39:16.143 --> 39:17.721
and I'm on my way to meet
some guys right now,

39:17.722 --> 39:20.700
but I guess James thought
you were pretty good.

39:21.691 --> 39:23.574
So if you want to come audition...

39:26.448 --> 39:28.386
Well, thanks, Keith. Yeah.

39:28.387 --> 39:29.121
Yeah, man.

39:29.122 --> 39:30.745
Listen up, everyone.

39:30.746 --> 39:33.890
I, uh, just wanted to
commend all of you

39:33.891 --> 39:35.360
on a job well done,

39:35.361 --> 39:38.693
as I always do at the
end of every case.

39:38.694 --> 39:41.225
It's what makes catching
the killer worthwhile.

39:41.226 --> 39:43.128
Which is strange, because
you think it would be

39:43.129 --> 39:45.055
catching the killer, but no.
It's...

39:45.056 --> 39:45.993
Uh, Sir.

39:45.994 --> 39:47.326
Uh, I'm sorry, Sir,

39:47.327 --> 39:49.476
about the, uh, the footage
that you were reviewing.

39:49.477 --> 39:51.726
Are you still working on that?

39:51.727 --> 39:53.283
No, I got through it.

39:53.284 --> 39:56.981
In fact, Detective Beckett,
Mr. Castle,

39:56.982 --> 39:59.020
my office, please.

40:10.735 --> 40:12.508
I'm sure you both
know why you're here.

40:12.509 --> 40:15.188
- Sir, if you could just let us explain.
- Oh, you'd better.

40:15.189 --> 40:17.935
Because I don't find
this very funny.

40:20.005 --> 40:22.401
I am proud to say
that I have the, uh,

40:22.402 --> 40:25.099
highest rate of solving
crimes here in New York City.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.049
That's due to... in
no small part...

40:27.050 --> 40:29.765
to my fine police
officers and detectives,

40:29.766 --> 40:32.388
who take their work
rather seriously.

40:32.389 --> 40:35.286
Uh, they live here
at the precinct.

40:35.287 --> 40:37.308
They dedicate their
entire lives.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.634
Uh, we are a close-knit family.

40:39.635 --> 40:41.021
Would you call that behavior

40:41.022 --> 40:43.608
appropriate for a
police precinct?

40:44.201 --> 40:45.270
- Uh, I...
- No.

40:45.271 --> 40:46.446
You're damn right.

40:46.447 --> 40:49.315
Just what kind of PR debacle
are you trying to inflict on me?

40:49.316 --> 40:50.222
I'm sorry, Sir.

40:50.223 --> 40:52.763
That's the, uh, footage
that you're talking about?

40:52.764 --> 40:54.843
- That...that's it?
- That's not enough?

40:54.844 --> 40:56.860
Is there something else I
should be looking for?

40:56.861 --> 40:59.318
Like something on that
tape they say is missing?

40:59.319 --> 41:01.579
- No. Not even... no, nothing.
- We... no, no.

41:01.580 --> 41:03.442
- No, there's...
- Oh, for the love of...

41:03.443 --> 41:06.730
What kind of foolishness
is going on out there?

41:07.405 --> 41:08.858
I need to view all of this tape.

41:08.859 --> 41:10.770
You understand? All of it.

41:10.771 --> 41:14.721
* Think of all the dreams
we've been chasing *

41:15.796 --> 41:18.191
* driving through the sunshine

41:18.277 --> 41:20.485
* driving through the rain

41:20.879 --> 41:22.635
* back out on the road

41:22.636 --> 41:24.025
* again

41:25.233 --> 41:27.084
* drive away, drive away

41:27.085 --> 41:30.165
* can't you hear it calling?

41:30.166 --> 41:32.319
* Roll away, roll away

41:32.320 --> 41:35.147
* it's a brand-new dawning

41:35.148 --> 41:37.220
* drive away, drive away

41:37.221 --> 41:40.139
* can't hear you it calling?

41:40.140 --> 41:42.187
* Roll away, roll away

41:42.188 --> 41:45.986
* it's a brand-new day

41:46.245 --> 41:49.110
* anyone can see
my heart's racing *

41:49.297 --> 41:50.837
See, I told you I could sing.

41:50.838 --> 41:52.523
- * But now the wait is over
- I taught him how to do that.

41:52.539 --> 41:53.570
* Now the wait is over

41:53.585 --> 41:55.819
- * and it's us against the world
- * and it's us against the world

41:55.820 --> 41:58.190
* When I think of all the time
I've been wasting *

41:58.222 --> 42:00.480
* I've been wasting

42:00.508 --> 42:02.838
- * I never would've made it...
- Come here.

42:02.839 --> 42:03.680
Come on.

42:04.926 --> 42:08.191
Look, I know I'm not the
easiest person on the planet

42:08.192 --> 42:08.969
to get to know,

42:08.970 --> 42:10.545
but you guys have been patient,

42:10.546 --> 42:12.755
and I've got something
to show you.

42:13.165 --> 42:14.082
It's a secret.

42:14.083 --> 42:15.668
Actually, Castle doesn't
even know about it.

42:15.669 --> 42:18.481
It's...it's this place
that I love to go to,

42:18.482 --> 42:19.432
and once you see it,

42:19.433 --> 42:22.274
I think you guys will understand
me a whole lot better.

42:22.275 --> 42:24.246
* That we've been chasing,
yeah *

42:24.247 --> 42:25.981
* I never would've made it

42:25.982 --> 42:26.823
Go ahead.
All the way to the back.

42:26.824 --> 42:28.341
* On my own

42:28.552 --> 42:29.071
Turn.

42:29.577 --> 42:31.477
* I never would've
made it home *

42:33.261 --> 42:34.362
Hey!

42:34.363 --> 42:35.070
Hey!
