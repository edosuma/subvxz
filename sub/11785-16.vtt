YOUR FAKE, USELESS VAULT.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.584
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO BE

38:53.915 --> 38:56.584
THE WORST INSURANCE-SCAM STORY

38:56.626 --> 38:57.585
I HAVE EVER HEARD.

38:57.627 --> 38:58.586
CUFF 'EM.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.088
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED!

39:00.130 --> 39:01.714
THEY WERE CON MEN!

39:00.130 --> 39:01.714
THEY PLAYED US!

39:01.756 --> 39:03.382
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:01.756 --> 39:03.382
TELL THAT TO A JUDGE.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.051
INSURANCE FRAUD

39:03.424 --> 39:05.051
IS A FELONY IN OREGON.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.053
-IT'S YOUR FAULT, B.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.053
-MY  FAULT?!

39:07.095 --> 39:09.222
"SHANGHAI TUNNELS.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.222
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?"

39:09.264 --> 39:10.890
THEY WENT TO YOU FIRST

39:09.264 --> 39:10.890
BECAUSE THEY KNEW

39:10.932 --> 39:12.600
THAT YOU WOULD BE

39:10.932 --> 39:12.600
DUMB ENOUGH TO BUY IT.

39:12.642 --> 39:13.977
Y-YOU'RE DUMB.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.691
HOW MANY RESTITUTION CHECKS

39:16.729 --> 39:19.691
YOU WRITING?

39:19.732 --> 39:23.528
UH, SO FAR, 200.

39:19.732 --> 39:23.528
I'VE GOT 100 TO GO.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.864
YOU GOT MAIL.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.406
I'M OUT, MAN.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.794
HOW?

39:39.836 --> 39:41.796
HOW COULD YOU HAVE POSSIBLY

39:39.836 --> 39:41.796
KNOWN THIS?

39:41.838 --> 39:43.631
I KNEW ENOUGH.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.633
I KNEW YOU HAD

39:43.673 --> 39:45.633
A COMPLICATED CON IN THE WORKS.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.136
AND I KNEW, AS LONG AS WE HAD

39:45.675 --> 39:48.136
THOSE THREE THINGS ON THE LIST

39:48.178 --> 39:50.138
AND THAT BARBARA MADSEN

39:48.178 --> 39:50.138
WAS DISTRACTED

39:50.180 --> 39:52.307
FROM ALL THAT GOLD PILING UP

39:50.180 --> 39:52.307
IN THAT USELESS VAULT,

39:52.349 --> 39:54.893
THAT WE HAD A SHOT AT

39:52.349 --> 39:54.893
TAKING OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.853
YOU NEVER COUNT ON

39:54.934 --> 39:56.853
THE PERFECT PLAN.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.314
THE PERFECT PLAN,

39:56.895 --> 39:59.314
IT HAS TOO MANY MOVING PARTS,

39:59.356 --> 40:02.108
AND IT'S...YOU GOT TO EXPECT

39:59.356 --> 40:02.108
THE PERFECT PLAN TO FAIL.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.609
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.278
THEN WHAT DO YOU COUNT ON?

40:05.320 --> 40:07.655
I COUNT ON

40:05.320 --> 40:07.655
THE SIMPLEST AND UGLIEST PLAN,

40:07.697 --> 40:10.825
NOT PLAN "A," NO, BUT, LIKE,

40:07.697 --> 40:10.825
PLAN "G," FOR EXAMPLE.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.828
I  START  WITH PLAN "G."

40:13.870 --> 40:15.788
NOW, THE QUICK, SIMPLE,

40:13.870 --> 40:15.788
UGLY PLAN

40:15.830 --> 40:18.499
THAT I KNOW IS GONNA WORK

40:15.830 --> 40:18.499
IF EVERYTHING GOES BAD.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.836
I JUST PRETTY IT UP

40:18.541 --> 40:21.836
A LITTLE BIT, ADD THIS AND THAT.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.505
I GAVE YOU A BACKUP PLAN.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.505
THAT'S ALL.

40:24.547 --> 40:28.385
YOU KNOW, HARDISON,

40:24.547 --> 40:28.385
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.720
PROUD?

40:30.762 --> 40:33.472
MY FIRST JOB

40:30.762 --> 40:33.472
COMPLETELY FELL APART.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.768
HEY...

40:36.809 --> 40:39.020
IT WAS A GOOD PLAN.

40:39.062 --> 40:42.690
IT WAS A SMART PLAN, CLEVER.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.404
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

41:20.895 --> 41:21.854
WHAT'S THIS?

41:21.896 --> 41:23.481
OH, UH, IT'S AN EVALUATION FORM.

41:23.522 --> 41:24.565
GOOD NIGHT, HARDISON.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.319
HEY, NATHAN.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.115
THANKS, MAN.
