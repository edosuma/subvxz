WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:06.555
- You got a date tonight?
- No.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.995
Aren't you gonna ask me if I do?

00:12.040 --> 00:14.349
Okay. You got a date tonight?

00:14.520 --> 00:16.750
Sure, rub my nose in it.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.270
Besides, I'd rather hang out
with you and Jake...

00:21.440 --> 00:24.477
...than engage in mindless conversation
with some strange woman...

00:24.640 --> 00:27.234
...in the desperate hope that
she might sleep with me.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.152
Me too.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.558
If we can't lie to each other,
who can we lie to?

00:34.720 --> 00:36.870
To family.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.038
- Who is it?
- It's Mom.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.679
Oh, odds.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.559
- Once, twice, three, shoot.
- Once, twice, three, shoot.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.472
Hey, Mom.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.312
No, I don't have a date tonight.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.471
Don't you wanna know about Alan?

00:58.800 --> 01:00.358
So, what's up?

01:00.520 --> 01:02.238
Yes, I got your message.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.992
I was gonna call you back, but...

01:04.760 --> 01:06.591
I was.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.318
I was.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.311
I was.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.359
Okay, I wasn't.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.679
I'm sorry.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.229
And do you wanna tell me
why you called?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.516
I said, I'm sorry.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.958
I am sorry. I am. I am.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.475
All right, I'm not.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.513
So, what's up? Tomorrow?

01:30.680 --> 01:33.672
Yeah, sure. One of us will be here.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.352
I'll be here.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.629
All right, gotta go. Love you.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.109
No, I'm not just saying that.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.759
I'm not.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.353
No, I'm not.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.759
Mom, we both know where this going.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.591
- Sorry to stick you with her.
- Yeah, sure.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.034
- I am.
- Right.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.519
- I am.
- Whatever.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.075
Okay, I'm not.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.679
Schmuck.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.834
For 30 years, every time I call odds,
he throws a two, and I'm the schmuck.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.555
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.718
- Here's the bill for Jake's class trip.
- Why give it to me?

02:12.920 --> 02:14.797
- So you can pay it.
- Me?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.871
What's the point of giving
child support...

02:17.040 --> 02:18.632
...if you don't support the child?

02:18.840 --> 02:20.637
Child support doesn't cover
class trips.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.831
- Says who?
- You wanna make an issue of this?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.276
Have your lawyer call mine. They can
decide who pays for class trips.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.074
Oh, I'm sorry. Class trips?

02:29.240 --> 02:31.959
I'm happy to pay for class trips.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.829
I thought you said "ass clips."

02:36.040 --> 02:37.473
What are ass clips?

02:37.680 --> 02:40.114
I don't know,
but I don't intend to pay for them.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.197
Goodbye, Alan.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.235
At least we settled who pays
for ass clips around here.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.158
Okay, Mom. Good talking to you.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.719
I'm gonna hang up now.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.757
Yes, I am.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.317
I am.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.309
Okay, I'm not.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.314
- Jake's here.
- Cool.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.869
It wouldn't kill you to talk to Mom
once in a while.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.514
We don't know that.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.229
- Besides, you lost fair and square.
- I don't think so.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.552
- I think you cheated.
- At odds and evens?

03:22.720 --> 03:25.553
How on earth does one cheat
at odds and evens?

03:25.760 --> 03:30.436
Don't give me that big, cow-eyed,
aw-shucks, Howdy Doody veneer.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.112
- What?
- You heard me.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.878
Yeah, I heard you...

03:36.040 --> 03:38.679
...and as long as we're
stringing random words together...

03:38.840 --> 03:40.398
...shoebox, MoonPie, Band-Aid.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.755
Let me tell you something, Alan,
and I say this with no agenda.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.993
I am not a judgmental person,
but you, you are a horrible little man.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.950
You smile, tell everybody
what they wanna hear...

03:53.120 --> 03:55.873
...but I know what goes on
inside your grinning puppet head.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.393
You don't have a clue what's going on
inside my puppet head...

03:59.560 --> 04:02.279
...because to know that,
you would have to be capable of...

04:02.440 --> 04:06.274
...perceiving the world that exists
beyond the tip of your penis.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.631
Don't talk about my penis.
You have not earned the right.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.796
You are a selfish man, Charlie.
You're a user.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.156
You just suckle from the teat of life
and you never give back.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.793
"Suckle from the teat of life"?

04:18.959 --> 04:21.394
Who are you,
Henry Wadsworth Pinhead?

04:21.600 --> 04:24.160
- You call me that because I'm right.
- I call you that...

04:24.320 --> 04:26.197
...because you can wear
a thimble as a hat.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.757
Hey, what's going on?

04:29.120 --> 04:31.918
- Nothing.
- Just hanging out.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.513
Cool.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.074

04:54.520 --> 04:56.317
You know, if you guys were queer...

04:56.480 --> 04:59.472
...we'd be what they'd call
an alternated family.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.077
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.193
I feel bad about last night.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.638
That's okay. I forgive you.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.793
I didn't apologize.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.111
Well, then I guess I'm just
a bigger man than you are.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.279
I'm kidding. Forget about it.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.118
Okay.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.477
- What do you wanna do with Jake?
- I don't know. How about a barbecue?

05:34.640 --> 05:39.077
Well, I'm sure the kid's delicious,
but I think I'd rather have hamburgers.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.711
Dad, check it out.
Mom bought me new shoes.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.792
- Very cool.
- Yeah, they were really expensive.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.912
- I'll bet.
- She said to give you the bill.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.952
What? Why do I get the bill?

05:51.160 --> 05:53.151
So you can give me a check
to pay her back.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.028
- Why?
- She doesn't trust me with cash.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.794
No. Why should I be buying
your shoes?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.195
You didn't. Mom did.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.192
This is so wrong. I send her
a child support check every month...

06:10.360 --> 06:14.114
...which is supposed to include things
like clothing, food, shoes.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.592
Alan, you're like an Alzheimer's victim
in a whorehouse.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.314
Excuse me?

06:22.520 --> 06:26.274
You're constantly surprised that
you've been screwed...

06:29.960 --> 06:31.837
...and you don't wanna pay for it.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.391
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.994
Did you drop off the dry cleaning
by the back door?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.474
That was dry cleaning?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.279
I thought you were throwing
that stuff out.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.595
You threw out my clothes?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.560
I gave them to my sister's husband, Earl.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.033
You gave three cashmere sweaters and
a new sport coat to your brother-in-law?

06:56.240 --> 06:59.038
Why shouldn't he have nice things?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.868
He's paid his debt to society.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.354
You have to get them back.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.835
I wish I could, but Earl's got
one withered arm...

07:07.000 --> 07:08.991
...and he had all
the left sleeves hemmed.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.431
Those were expensive clothes, Berta.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.392
Wanna take it out in trade, stud?

07:15.280 --> 07:18.397
Because this back brace snaps off
with the flick of a wrist.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.111
Okay, okay, that's the last straw.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.909
You have abused my good nature for too
long, and I am putting my foot down.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.552
Well, you let me know
how that works out for you.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.591
I guess we know
who's in charge around here.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.236
If I want your opinion,
I'll ask your ex-wife.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.920
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
Well, if I want your opinion...

07:45.080 --> 07:48.959
...I'll ask one of the dozens of women
you have meaningless casual sex with.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.116
Oh, ouch.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.595
- Hey, Uncle Charlie?
- What?

07:55.160 --> 07:57.390
- I love you.
- What did you do, Jake?

07:58.040 --> 07:59.314
I love you too, Dad.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.636
- What did he do?
- How am I supposed to know?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.478
Well, he's your knuckleheaded son.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.712
He's my knuckleheaded son now,
but when you're trawling for tail...

08:06.880 --> 08:09.474
...at The Home Depot,
he's your slow but adorable nephew.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.592
I might as well get one perk
out of having you sponge off me.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.320
- Sponge? Sponge?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.999
Well, let me tell you something.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.196
Take away your fancy house,
your fancy car...

08:19.360 --> 08:20.998
...your women,
and what have you got?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.918
A better-Iooking version of you.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.076
Have I mentioned how much
I hate you?

08:25.240 --> 08:27.071
Have I mentioned how much
I hate you?

08:27.280 --> 08:28.918
- Don't copy me.
- Don't copy me.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.672
- You're an idiot.
- You're an idiot.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.832
- I'm warning you, Charlie.
- I'm warning you, Charlie.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.235
How childish.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.956
Would you mind toasting my buns,
please?

08:47.080 --> 08:48.513
To your buns.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.555
You sicken me.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.919
Hey.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.798
- Hey, Rose.
- What's going on?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.831
Just making lunch.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.356
- Wanna join us?
- Maybe some other time.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.115
A little garlic butter is also a good way
to jazz up a hamburger bun.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.151
He's lucky all I'm doing is spitting.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.512
It doesn't take a master's in behavioral
psychology, which I happen to have...

09:21.680 --> 09:25.070
...to see that you and you brother
have unresolved fraternal conflicts.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.838
Gee, you think?

09:27.920 --> 09:29.990
I think it might be therapeutic
for you two...

09:30.160 --> 09:32.754
...to sit down with someone
and explore those conflicts.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.155
- You mean you?
- Well, I could refer you...

09:35.320 --> 09:38.949
...to the woman I talk to,
but she doesn't exist.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.792
So, yeah. Me.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.436
Let's see. Couples counseling for me
and Alan with you as the therapist.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.074
Why don't we just drop acid,
run out into the ocean...

09:47.240 --> 09:49.071
...and pretend we're dolphins?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.155
You're exhibiting
a lot of hostility, Charlie.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.311
You know what we psychologists
call that?

09:54.480 --> 09:56.118
- What?
- Hostility.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.033
Why would we need
more than one word for it?

10:00.680 --> 10:04.514
Rose, I appreciate your concern,
but Alan and I don't need therapy.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.188
Everything will work itself out.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.079
I'm just saying, I think
it would really help you guys...

10:21.240 --> 10:24.277
...if you could sit down
and share your feelings.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.274
We're fine, Rose.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.079
- Choke on it, princess.
- Bite me, bitch.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.437
I think he may have anticipated that.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.235
- How Freudian.
- It's not Freudian.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.711
But mine's bigger.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.876
It's a banana, you moron.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.039
It's not just about you and Charlie,
you know.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.475
There's that innocent little moppet
to consider.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.999
Moppet?

11:40.240 --> 11:43.550
I'm baking air biscuits.
Get them while they're hot.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.152
He may not be able
to process it now...

11:46.320 --> 11:49.039
...but he picks up on all
the negative emotion around here.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.238
Save yourselves, run for your lives!

11:53.840 --> 11:56.400
Okay, well, if you can
get Charlie to agree, I'll do it.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.478
- Good.
- And as a rule...

11:58.680 --> 12:01.035
...when says they're bad,
take his word for it.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.276
Oh, please, Alan. I grew up with
two older brothers and...

12:05.440 --> 12:07.715
Oh, my God!

12:11.240 --> 12:13.834
The only reason I let him live here
is because of Jake.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.274
Go on.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.670
He was a pain in the ass
when we were kids...

12:17.840 --> 12:21.355
...and now he's blossomed into
a three-fingered prostate exam.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.550
Have you considered the possibility
that since you're the older brother...

12:25.720 --> 12:27.551
...you harbor resentment
towards him...

12:27.720 --> 12:29.676
...for usurping Mommy's love
and attention?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.518
I'm sorry, have you met my mother?

12:32.160 --> 12:34.151
Okay, so that's a no.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.791
Please don't try to psychoanalyze me.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.197
Oh, Charlie.
Psychoanalysis takes years.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.555
I'm just messing around
inside your head.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.595
Have you ever considered
the possibility...

12:46.760 --> 12:49.593
...that you are the primary
male role model in Alan's life?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.792
And if his behavior is making you mad,
he learned it from you.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.509
So, in fact, you are making you mad.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.673
That's nuts.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.350
Just sit with it for a moment.
I think it's a pretty good insight.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.629
No, I'm gonna stick with nuts.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.832
And I don't wanna continue this.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.508
Do you feel you can't be
totally honest with me...

13:11.720 --> 13:13.358
...since we slept together?
- No.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.232
Why can't you be totally honest?

13:15.440 --> 13:18.034
- I can be totally honest with you.
- Really?

13:18.200 --> 13:20.077
How much did you like
having sex with me?

13:21.040 --> 13:22.996
Let's go talk to Alan.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.033
And they wouldn't give me a license.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.472
All right. Let the healing begin,
you pinhead.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.148
Can we refrain from
counterproductive name-calling?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.314
Such big words
from such a little head.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.072
Charlie, please sit down.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.675
Okay. Here are the ground rules.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.593
There will be no name-calling
and no interrupting.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.355
The purpose of this is
to air our feelings without judgment.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.636
- Alan, why don't you start?
- Why does he start?

13:55.840 --> 13:57.159
- Would you like to start?
- No.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.992
Then shut up.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.957
Alan, you'll go first.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.113
And begin with the phrase,
"I feel Charlie is 'blank.'"

14:06.840 --> 14:09.035
I don't think I can top that.

14:13.240 --> 14:18.109
Okay, I feel like Charlie is...

14:18.640 --> 14:20.278
...ashamed to have me as a brother.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.110
Well, there you go. Are we done?

14:23.680 --> 14:25.716
Charlie, you'll get your turn.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.075
When was the first time
you felt that way, Alan?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.678
I guess on the playground.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.229
The first day of kindergarten,
he told his friends...

14:33.400 --> 14:36.039
...that I was a shaved monkey
our mom won in a poker game.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.869
Charlie, why do you think you might
have said something like that?

14:44.200 --> 14:48.079
Well, I guess deep down...

14:48.240 --> 14:51.232
...I always wanted a shaved monkey.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.071
You promised Mom
you would look after me.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.994
I was 7 years old.
You can't trust a 7-year-old.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.317
You know how he looks after me?
He gave me wedgies.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.516
From kindergarten on,
I got daily wedgies.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.229
My butt cheeks didn't unclench
until my second year of college.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.195
At which point, a long stick slid out.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.999
Let's try a little role-playing.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.875
He put dog poop in my
<i>Mork and Mindy</i> lunchbox.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.875
Oh, will you please let that go?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.436
And by the way,
if you think it through...

15:23.600 --> 15:25.591
...we didn't have a dog.
- What?

15:25.760 --> 15:27.955
Mom told me to make you lunch,
I made you lunch.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.199
Oh, my God! Do you see...

15:30.360 --> 15:32.920
...what I have been dealing with
my entire life?

15:33.080 --> 15:36.755
The real genius was putting it
in a hot-dog bun.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.072
All through the second grade...

15:39.240 --> 15:41.834
...he would introduce me
as his ugly sister, Alana?

15:42.760 --> 15:46.548
That's because all through second grade,
you wore culottes.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.953
They were extra roomy Bermuda shorts.
I was prone to chafing.

15:52.600 --> 15:57.037
Charlie, how did you feel when you
were calling Alan a monkey or a girl...

15:57.240 --> 15:59.276
...or putting excrement in
his lunchbox?

16:00.240 --> 16:02.276
It's hard to describe.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.477
It was kind of a warm,
satisfied feeling.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.077
And why do you think
you felt that way?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.433
Because he was such a smartass.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.275
Straight A's, Mommy's favorite,
Daddy's boy, stepdaddy's boy.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.237
Somebody had to take him down a peg.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.354
- You were jealous of me.
- No, no.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.158
- I was annoyed.
- I don't believe it.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.276
- You were jealous.
- No, I wasn't.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.914
- Sounds like you were, Charlie.
- You can't take sides.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.798
- That's unprofessional.
- Professional?

16:27.960 --> 16:30.030
I'm just making this up as I go along.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.719
I'm drawing kitty-cats here.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.350
All these years,
you had to put me down...

16:37.520 --> 16:40.239
...because you secretly believed
that I was better than you.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.158
No, that's ridiculous.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.874
I knew I was better,
but I didn't think you knew.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.072
No, no, I didn't know that.
There was nothing to know.

16:48.280 --> 16:51.078
I don't buy it. You were
an emotionally wounded child.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.589
I wasn't wounded.
I was the wounder.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.591
He was the woundee.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.433
I was a mean, rotten brother.
You've gotta believe me.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.079
I tortured him.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.999
Once, I convinced him
the clothes dryer was a time machine.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.549
When he got out,
I was dressed in Pilgrim clothes...

17:05.720 --> 17:08.393
...and threatened to burn him
as a witch.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.595
And now I understand why
you did all those things.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.512
- And I forgive you.
- Don't forgive me.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.273
Hate me. Fear me.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.512
- Come here.
- No.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.233
- Come on. Give me a hug.
- No, forget it.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.118
- Would you rather hug me?
- What would be the point of that?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.676
It gets me hot.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.874
All right, if it'll put an end to all this,
one hug.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.034
Hey, what are you doing?

17:39.240 --> 17:43.597
Let's see how you like a wedgie.
Where's your underwear?

17:43.800 --> 17:46.951
I'm not wearing any,
but thanks for scratching my ass.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.871
- This turned out to be a nice weekend.
- Yeah. Go figure.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.110
Who would've thought Rose
would be right?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.992
Certainly not Rose.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.509
She was right.
We had a lot of baggage to clear up.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.518
- Yeah, and I'm glad we talked it out.
- Me too.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.673
You know, when all is said and done,
all we have in this world is each other.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.751
You, me and that methane cloud
you call a son.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.958
- It's Mom.
- Odds.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.350
That's okay. I got this one.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.988
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mom.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.310
Oh, that's Judith.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.359
No, I'm just sitting here, enjoying
the sunset with my favorite brother.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.192
Alan.

18:37.520 --> 18:41.399
I'm not lying. I'm not. I'm not.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.959
Okay, I am.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.993
Jake, your mom's here.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.476
- Hey, Judith, how's it going?
- I just had a flat tire on the freeway...

18:49.640 --> 18:52.518
...and called AAA, only to find
out I no longer have AAA...

18:52.680 --> 18:55.877
...because you no longer pay my dues.
- Excuse me, but we're divorced.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.076
- You pay that out of your alimony.
- No.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.038
Because you didn't, I had to stand
on the side of the road...

19:01.200 --> 19:04.033
...until a creepy man stopped
and offered to change my tire...

19:04.200 --> 19:05.599
...if I'd show him my breasts.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.951
Well, there you go.
I paid for your breasts.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.549
Okay, fine.
We'll let our attorneys figure out...

19:11.760 --> 19:13.990
...who pays for roadside service.
- No attorneys.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.798
- I'm happy to pay for it.
- Thank you.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.794
- Was that so hard?
- No. No, not hard at all.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.309
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, buddy.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.913
In fact, it was easy.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.755
All I had to do was bend over
and unclench.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.359
Okay, I said it.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.829
Mom, you just said I said it.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.437
- Have fun at school.
- All right.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.591
Charlie, wait up.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.990
- Did you make Alan's lunch?
- Yep.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.151
Hey, wait.
You forgot to kiss me goodbye.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.197
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.351
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.593
- Okay, I did.
- Charlie, wait up.
