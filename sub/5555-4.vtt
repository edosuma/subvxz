O lord...

00:07.414 --> 00:10.282
Am I on the right path?

00:10.317 --> 00:12.918
If so, please...

00:12.953 --> 00:14.938
give me a sign.

[Whirring, steam hisses]

00:56.696 --> 00:58.998
Nothing worse than bad coffee.

00:59.032 --> 01:01.233
Martha? Is everything okay?

01:01.268 --> 01:02.574
You tell <i>me,</i> kiddo.

01:02.594 --> 01:05.905
Last time we were together,
you and Richard were,

01:05.939 --> 01:07.273
uh, "ha ha," you know?

01:07.307 --> 01:09.141
And now,
just a few short weeks later,

01:09.176 --> 01:11.877
you and Richard are, uh
"pfft," you know?

01:12.946 --> 01:14.180
It's complicated.

01:14.214 --> 01:15.414
Mm.

01:15.448 --> 01:17.650
So were his last two divorces.

01:17.684 --> 01:19.118
Oh, God. Martha,
we're not getting a divorce.

01:19.152 --> 01:20.953
Well, call me old-fashioned,

01:20.987 --> 01:23.489
but don't married couples
live together?

01:23.523 --> 01:25.257
Yes, but i-it's complicated,

01:25.292 --> 01:27.326
and... and I'm working through
a few things.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.427
Richard told me that...

01:28.461 --> 01:32.198
right before he declared
he was going to win you back.

01:32.232 --> 01:36.302
Look, as you know,
my son is a lot of things...

01:36.336 --> 01:40.972
some of them good,
some of them not so good.

01:40.992 --> 01:46.212
But he is someone
you can <i>always</i> count on.

01:46.246 --> 01:49.181
And that is a rare thing, kiddo.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.151
[Cellphone rings]

01:52.185 --> 01:54.453
[Cellphone beeps] Beckett.

01:54.487 --> 01:55.861
Uh, yeah.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.324
All right.
I'll have detectives respond.

01:58.358 --> 01:59.391
[Cellphone beeps]

01:59.426 --> 02:01.860
Uh, Martha, I'm sorry.
Uh, there's a murder, and...

02:01.895 --> 02:03.796
Katherine, darling...

02:08.689 --> 02:11.807
Look, be honest with yourself

02:12.226 --> 02:14.506
and be honest with your husband.

02:18.511 --> 02:20.553
[Sighs]

02:20.947 --> 02:24.016
Ryan: Man, I thought
the second kid would be cheaper.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.951
But Jenny...
she wants all new stuff.

02:25.986 --> 02:28.721
You should see the baby stroller
that she picked out.

02:28.755 --> 02:31.357
Seriously, I might have to get
a second full-time job.

02:31.391 --> 02:34.059
Or you can make more money
from your <i>first</i> job.

02:34.094 --> 02:35.327
What, like overtime?

02:35.362 --> 02:36.328
No... promotion.

02:36.363 --> 02:38.697
Sergeant's exam is in a week.
Let's take it.

02:38.732 --> 02:41.066
A week?! When are we
gonna have time to study?

02:41.101 --> 02:42.067
How hard can it be?

02:42.102 --> 02:43.168
Sergeant Wilkie passed,

02:43.203 --> 02:45.537
and he's, like, a chromosome
away from a neanderthal.

02:45.572 --> 02:46.739
Maybe you're right.

02:46.773 --> 02:49.427
Okay, I'll call 1PP, sign us both up.

02:57.117 --> 02:58.490
Good morning.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.186
Allow me the pleasure
of introducing you

03:01.221 --> 03:04.723
to Dave Johnson, 52,
single GSW to the sternum.

03:04.758 --> 03:06.659
Killer popped him
while he was praying.

03:06.693 --> 03:07.793
[Groans]

03:09.220 --> 03:11.030
What? Did you guys
rehearse that?

03:11.064 --> 03:12.665
Former altar boys.

03:12.699 --> 03:15.200
Yeah. Probably an involuntary
reflex or something.

03:15.235 --> 03:17.536
Wound suggests he was shot

03:17.570 --> 03:19.538
between 8:00 and 11:00 p.m.
last night.

03:19.572 --> 03:22.608
Kind of late for a church to be
open to the public, isn't it?

03:22.642 --> 03:24.610
It <i>wasn't...</i>
<i>the sisters of the parish</i>

03:24.644 --> 03:26.378
said the place was locked
at 6:00,

03:26.413 --> 03:27.780
but discovered this morning

03:27.814 --> 03:29.615
that the front door
had been jimmied.

03:29.649 --> 03:32.117
So, what... Dave and the killer
broke in together?

03:32.152 --> 03:33.752
Doubt it... evidence shows

03:33.787 --> 03:36.055
that the killer snuck in
and shot Dave from behind

03:36.089 --> 03:39.058
what <i>was</i> a decorative
stained-glass window for prayer.

03:39.092 --> 03:40.309
Ah.

03:41.561 --> 03:42.895
Really?!

03:42.929 --> 03:46.298
[Clacking]
What is going on here?

03:46.333 --> 03:48.767
Ryan: Father, did you know Dave Johnson?

03:48.802 --> 03:53.105
Oh, yes.
He was a faithful parishioner.

03:53.139 --> 03:54.139
Do you have any idea

03:54.174 --> 03:56.208
what Dave was doing
at the church last night?

03:56.242 --> 03:57.209
Not a clue.

03:57.243 --> 03:59.645
Perhaps his wife knows.

03:59.679 --> 04:01.705
Have you spoken to Wendy?

04:01.725 --> 04:03.716
No. We haven't notified her yet.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.584
But what can you tell us
about Dave?

04:05.618 --> 04:07.419
Did... did he have any enemies?

04:07.454 --> 04:08.787
Oh, no.

04:08.822 --> 04:12.758
He was a good man,
a loving husband,

04:12.792 --> 04:15.561
and arguably
one of the greatest...

04:16.495 --> 04:17.995
Greatest what?

04:18.031 --> 04:21.500
Well, it's going to come out
sooner or later.

04:21.534 --> 04:23.068
[Sighs]

04:23.103 --> 04:25.771
Dave was one
of the greatest novelists

04:25.805 --> 04:27.473
of the last 50 years.

04:27.507 --> 04:29.475
Dave Johnson?

04:29.509 --> 04:31.944
Uh, I've never heard of him, father.

04:31.978 --> 04:35.514
That's because
he wrote under a pseudonym.

04:35.548 --> 04:37.649
Dad? Did you hear?

04:39.018 --> 04:39.840
Dad?

04:39.860 --> 04:41.787
It's my pony! You can't pet it!

04:41.821 --> 04:43.622
Your pony?

04:43.656 --> 04:45.812
What? Hey.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.995
What's up?

04:50.029 --> 04:50.996
[Sighs]

04:51.030 --> 04:52.598
P.J. Moffet's dead.

04:54.901 --> 04:58.103
P.J. Moffet was
one of my literary heroes.

04:59.439 --> 05:00.539
Mine too.

05:00.574 --> 05:02.908
Remember, I wrote that paper
about him in eighth grade.

05:02.943 --> 05:05.711
Every author dreams of writing
the great American novel,

05:05.745 --> 05:09.315
but P.J. Moffet actually did it.

05:09.349 --> 05:12.351
On his first try, too...
"The Butcherbird's Song."

05:12.385 --> 05:14.854
And in 25 years,
he never wrote another word.

05:14.888 --> 05:17.556
Just one book, then he
disappeared from public life.

05:17.591 --> 05:18.424
According to Twitter,

05:18.458 --> 05:19.992
he was murdered at St. Mark's on 3rd.

05:20.026 --> 05:21.193
That's wonderful.

05:21.228 --> 05:22.661
Dad, a little respect
for the dead.

05:22.696 --> 05:24.330
Not wonderful
that he was murdered...

05:24.364 --> 05:25.764
wonderful <i>where</i> he was murdered.

05:25.799 --> 05:27.059
St. Mark's...

05:27.079 --> 05:28.734
that's in the jurisdiction
of the 12th precinct,

05:28.768 --> 05:31.170
and I am an expert
on all things P.J. Moffet.

05:31.204 --> 05:32.938
So you're still going with
the "win Beckett back

05:32.973 --> 05:34.106
by working homicides
with her" plan?

05:34.141 --> 05:36.242
That's how I got her to
fall for me the first time...

05:36.276 --> 05:39.245
that and... when I kiss her,
I use the bottom...

05:39.279 --> 05:41.013
Dad, when it comes
to your sex life, how about

05:41.047 --> 05:43.215
we stick with the
"afterschool special" version?

05:44.551 --> 05:45.584
That's fair.

05:45.619 --> 05:47.253
Okay, so, what's going to be

05:47.287 --> 05:48.921
your way into the case
this time?

05:48.955 --> 05:52.091
Well, all I need is, uh...

05:52.125 --> 05:53.459
a client.

05:53.493 --> 05:54.760
You guys, Lanie called.

05:54.794 --> 05:56.395
No usable prints
from the crime scene,

05:56.429 --> 05:57.563
and no hits off ballistics.

05:57.597 --> 06:01.567
Yo, "The Butcherbird Song"
is still a popular novel, right?

06:01.601 --> 06:02.801
I mean, it's 25 years old,

06:02.836 --> 06:05.104
but our victim should still be
getting huge royalty checks.

06:05.138 --> 06:07.473
Yeah. It's required reading
in most high schools.

06:07.507 --> 06:09.542
Then why was he living
in a one-bedroom apartment

06:09.576 --> 06:11.810
and working as a janitor
for the past five years?

06:11.845 --> 06:13.712
I'll call the publisher,
have them confirm who he is.

06:13.747 --> 06:15.114
No need.

06:16.316 --> 06:17.949
We can do that for you.

06:19.753 --> 06:22.288
Uh... Castle,
what are you doing here?

06:22.322 --> 06:23.289
Meet my client.

06:23.323 --> 06:25.958
This is Wendy Johnson,
wife of Dave Johnson,

06:25.992 --> 06:28.494
also known as
famed novelist P.J. Moffet.

06:28.528 --> 06:30.129
We're here to make a statement.

06:30.163 --> 06:33.760
Well, we'll... escort her
to Captain Beckett's office.

06:37.270 --> 06:39.405
Your client, Castle?

06:39.439 --> 06:42.474
Please don't tell me
you ambulance-chased this woman.

06:42.509 --> 06:44.677
Beckett, that is
an outrageous accusation.

06:44.711 --> 06:47.479
I, as a member
of the writing community,

06:47.514 --> 06:49.648
merely went by her home
to offer my condolences.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.684
Hmm. And I suppose you told her
that you're a P.I.

06:51.718 --> 06:54.147
Who just happens to have
connections with the NYPD.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.155
The topic <i>may</i> have come up.

06:56.189 --> 06:58.521
You look gorgeous, by the way.

07:02.496 --> 07:05.030
Uh, we should go
and talk to your client.

07:05.799 --> 07:08.167
Wendy: We'd only been married
for eight months.

07:08.201 --> 07:10.269
[Chuckles lightly]

07:10.303 --> 07:12.817
I felt like I'd known him
my entire life.

07:14.207 --> 07:19.011
Probably because I grew up
just <i>loving</i> that book.

07:19.046 --> 07:21.480
Beckett: Uh, yeah,
about that, Mrs. Johnson...

07:21.515 --> 07:23.949
considering
your husband's success,

07:23.984 --> 07:25.918
why was he working as a janitor?

07:25.952 --> 07:27.753
Well, that was research
for a new book.

07:27.788 --> 07:30.322
A second P.J. Moffet novel?

07:30.357 --> 07:32.658
He was doing research
for over five years?

07:32.692 --> 07:33.459
Mm-hmm.

07:33.493 --> 07:35.161
Moffet was legendary

07:35.195 --> 07:38.831
for total immersion
in his subject matter...

07:38.865 --> 07:40.599
much like me with you.

07:40.634 --> 07:44.203
Uh, did you know that
before writing a single word

07:44.237 --> 07:46.605
of "The Butcherbird Song,"
Moffet spent seven years

07:46.640 --> 07:48.274
living as
a drug-addicted eskimo?

07:48.308 --> 07:49.875
It's true.

07:49.910 --> 07:52.878
He was extremely dedicated
to his craft.

07:52.913 --> 07:55.514
Even though
he owns a ranch in Wyoming,

07:55.549 --> 07:58.818
he insisted we live in Brooklyn
for authenticity.

07:58.852 --> 08:02.354
Why did he break into
St. Mark's church last night?

08:02.389 --> 08:04.223
I can only guess it was to pray.

08:04.257 --> 08:08.327
He had been
extremely troubled recently.

08:08.361 --> 08:10.129
Do you know about what?

08:10.163 --> 08:11.964
I think it had to be
his research.

08:11.998 --> 08:13.666
[Inhales sharply]
When Dave left,

08:13.700 --> 08:15.835
he told me he met with someone
that morning,

08:15.869 --> 08:16.902
and things got heated.

08:16.937 --> 08:17.903
And who did he meet with?

08:17.938 --> 08:21.373
He didn't say...
just that the man was dangerous.

08:21.408 --> 08:23.542
Well, what was
his new book about?

08:23.577 --> 08:25.845
Um, the mafia.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.717
Hey. Where's Castle?

08:32.751 --> 08:34.153
He took his client home.

08:34.187 --> 08:36.822
Remember, he doesn't work cases
with us anymore.

08:36.857 --> 08:40.226
Hey. So, I found out where
our vic was yesterday morning.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.895
According to his financials,
he took a cab ride to Brooklyn.

08:42.929 --> 08:44.330
Where was he dropped off?

08:44.364 --> 08:46.365
This guy's house...
Milton Cicero.

08:46.399 --> 08:48.167
Works in sanitation.

08:48.201 --> 08:49.735
Word is he's totally mobbed up.

08:49.769 --> 08:51.737
If our vic was
doing research for his book

08:51.771 --> 08:52.938
and he asked too many questions,

08:52.973 --> 08:56.175
Milton here might have gotten
suspicious and taken Dave out.

08:57.477 --> 08:58.444
Milton: Okay.

08:58.478 --> 09:00.846
He did come to my house,

09:00.881 --> 09:04.250
but I didn't kill him...
I swear.

09:04.284 --> 09:06.452
- So, how do you know him?
- I don't.

09:06.486 --> 09:08.420
He just came over, started
asking me all these questions.

09:08.455 --> 09:09.455
About what?

09:09.489 --> 09:10.890
Union kickbacks.

09:10.924 --> 09:13.292
He wanted to know
where all the money comes from.

09:13.326 --> 09:14.860
Say...

09:14.895 --> 09:17.429
You two have any idea
who he really is?

09:17.464 --> 09:20.266
- Yeah. He's P.J. Moffet, the novelist.
- Yeah.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.367
[Chuckles]

09:21.401 --> 09:23.369
P.J. What? The what?

09:23.403 --> 09:24.770
No.

09:24.804 --> 09:28.107
That is
Jimmy "two guns" O'Malley.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.810
Whoa. Wait. Wha... uh...

09:31.845 --> 09:32.845
The Irish mobster

09:32.879 --> 09:35.447
who ratted out his whole crew
back in the '80s?

09:35.482 --> 09:36.782
Bingo.

09:36.816 --> 09:39.485
He starts telling me
all about Witness Protection

09:39.519 --> 09:42.421
and how the feds gave him
a new name... Dave Johnson.

09:42.455 --> 09:45.124
Hold up... doesn't the mob
have a contract out

09:45.158 --> 09:46.892
on Jimmy "two guns'" life?

09:46.927 --> 09:48.561
Do they?

09:48.595 --> 09:50.729
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.931
Milton?

09:51.965 --> 09:54.099
Did you try to collect
on that reward?

09:54.134 --> 09:58.070
Don't tell me that you made
a call up to the mob in Boston.

09:59.139 --> 10:02.474
I didn't... <i>not</i> call them.

10:03.476 --> 10:04.510
Okay, bye-bye.

10:04.544 --> 10:05.644
[Telephone beeps]

10:05.679 --> 10:06.845
[Sighs]

10:06.880 --> 10:10.516
So, I just got off the phone
with P.J. Moffet's publisher.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.118
Our author
is still very much alive.

10:13.153 --> 10:16.188
Dave Johnson was lying
about who he was.

10:16.223 --> 10:17.389
Ryan: Yeah, we figured.

10:17.424 --> 10:21.126
So, Dave tells Milton that
he's Jimmy "two guns" O'Malley,

10:21.161 --> 10:23.996
and then Milton rats him out
to the Irish mob.

10:24.030 --> 10:25.631
Maybe our vic was a con man.

10:25.665 --> 10:27.266
And conning the wrong guy
got him killed.

Captain Beckett?

10:39.753 --> 10:41.087
Hey.

10:41.121 --> 10:42.154
You heard back from the FBI?

10:42.189 --> 10:44.227
Yeah, it's looking more and more
like the Irish mob

10:44.247 --> 10:45.567
are responsible
for Dave's murder.

10:45.587 --> 10:49.008
Meet Billy o'Rourke, a suspected
hit man from southie.

10:49.028 --> 10:51.738
Word on the street is he landed
at jfk yesterday afternoon.

10:51.758 --> 10:52.665
Is he still in town?

10:52.700 --> 10:54.133
Well, as of two minutes ago,

10:54.168 --> 10:56.135
he hadn't checked out
of the Biltmore Hotel.

10:56.170 --> 10:56.869
Okay.

10:56.904 --> 10:58.605
Go find espo and pick him up.

10:58.639 --> 10:59.680
Yeah.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.774
- Ryan?
- Hmm?

11:01.809 --> 11:03.043
Be careful.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.582
You got it.

11:15.189 --> 11:16.679
Yeah.

11:20.327 --> 11:21.427
[Door opens]

11:24.765 --> 11:26.199
Is he in there?

11:27.434 --> 11:29.135
All right, thanks.
Get out of here, kid.

11:33.107 --> 11:35.842
Castle: So, she's telling me
she needs space.

11:35.876 --> 11:37.911
I'm saying
that's a cry for help.

11:37.945 --> 11:39.913
O'Rourke: Yeah, Ricky.
I completely agree.

11:39.947 --> 11:41.014
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.315
Mm-hmm.

11:42.349 --> 11:44.150
[Guns cock] NYPD!

11:44.184 --> 11:46.452
Hey, guys! How are...
are you hungry?

11:46.487 --> 11:50.123
Uh, sorry. Neither of us
ordered pigs wrapped in kevlar.

11:50.157 --> 11:50.924
[Chuckles] Get out.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.825
On your feet right now, O'Rourke.

11:54.728 --> 11:56.629
Castle, how'd you get here?

11:56.664 --> 11:58.631
Uh, when I gave Dave's wife
a ride home,

11:58.666 --> 11:59.933
I saw a receipt
from yesterday...

11:59.967 --> 12:01.868
a rush dry-cleaning job
on Dave's jacket.

12:01.902 --> 12:03.269
The bill was charged
to this room.

12:03.304 --> 12:04.337
How did <i>you</i> get here?

12:04.371 --> 12:05.371
The FBI.

12:05.406 --> 12:07.106
Castle, this guy...

12:07.141 --> 12:08.775
he's a hit man
for the Irish mob.

12:08.809 --> 12:09.509
No!

12:09.543 --> 12:10.556
Well, yes, yes.

12:10.611 --> 12:11.978
But w-when you get to know him,

12:12.012 --> 12:13.279
he's actually
really a l-lovely person.

12:13.314 --> 12:14.848
You know, he's a...
he's a good listener.

12:14.882 --> 12:16.483
O'Rourke: Yeah.
Thank you for that.

12:16.517 --> 12:17.817
- Uh, very hospitable.
- There you go.

12:17.852 --> 12:19.753
And he actually told me
that Dave...

12:19.787 --> 12:20.987
Ricky, they're cops. Shut up.

12:21.021 --> 12:23.656
No, they're <i>my</i> cops, though.
These guys are okay.

12:23.691 --> 12:24.691
Just...

12:24.725 --> 12:26.826
guys, Billy's not your killer.

12:26.861 --> 12:27.827
Oh, you know this how?

12:27.862 --> 12:29.429
Billy told me.

12:29.463 --> 12:31.197
Ohhhh. Yeah.

12:31.232 --> 12:33.466
Oh, and did he also
cross his heart and hope to die?

12:33.501 --> 12:34.300
[Sighs]

12:34.335 --> 12:36.803
Billy, tell them
what you told me.

12:36.837 --> 12:37.604
Okay.

12:37.638 --> 12:39.973
Uh, let's say, uh,
hypothetically...

12:40.007 --> 12:41.341
Hypothetically.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.676
Uh, I came to town
to whack Jimmy "two guns"

12:43.711 --> 12:46.646
and, uh... hypothetically...

12:46.680 --> 12:48.181
I threw him
in the trunk of my rental

12:48.215 --> 12:50.316
and drove him out to the marsh
by the meadowlands.

12:50.351 --> 12:51.351
You know where that is.

12:51.385 --> 12:52.352
Only, just before...

12:52.386 --> 12:53.820
- hypothetically...
- Of course.

12:53.854 --> 12:56.322
I could put a bullet
through his brain, I realized

12:56.357 --> 12:59.025
the guy doesn't look
anything like Jimmy "two guns."

12:59.059 --> 13:02.295
Right? So Dave explains it's all
just a misunderstanding,

13:02.329 --> 13:04.030
that he's actually
P.J. Moffet...

13:04.064 --> 13:05.098
[Chuckling] Yeah.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.233
And he's telling everybody
he's Jimmy "two guns"

13:07.268 --> 13:09.335
so he can do research
for his new novel.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.336
Yeah, and I'm a <i>huge</i> fan.

13:10.371 --> 13:12.172
"The Butcherbird Song"...
it's my everything.

13:12.206 --> 13:14.040
Oh, please. That's...
I have a copy myself.

13:14.074 --> 13:15.008
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

13:15.042 --> 13:15.775
- Whoa!
- No, no!

13:15.810 --> 13:17.177
So Billy brings Dave back here,

13:17.211 --> 13:18.645
and he pays
to have his jacket cleaned.

13:18.679 --> 13:20.980
Yeah. He even
autographed the book for me.

13:21.015 --> 13:22.015
Huh?

13:22.049 --> 13:23.183
Oh, isn't that lovely?

13:23.217 --> 13:24.083
Oh.

13:24.118 --> 13:25.885
Oh, hate to burst your bubble,
though.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.188
He ended up not being
P.J. Moffet after all.

13:28.222 --> 13:29.722
Guy was a con man.

13:29.757 --> 13:30.824
- Come on!
- Really?! No!

13:30.858 --> 13:34.060
And, by the way, Castle,
no matter what you say here,

13:34.094 --> 13:34.994
it doesn't prove

13:35.029 --> 13:37.897
that your new bff, Billy,
didn't off Dave.

13:37.932 --> 13:40.533
No, it doesn't,
but his alibi <i>does.</i>

13:40.568 --> 13:42.168
Yeah. At the time of the murder,

13:42.203 --> 13:43.837
he was front row
at "The Lion King."

13:43.871 --> 13:46.773
Uh-huh. Arguably
the best musical in town.

13:46.807 --> 13:47.941
Yeah, well, you're not wrong.

13:47.975 --> 13:51.110
But tell them what you saw

13:51.145 --> 13:52.512
before you put Dave
in the trunk.

13:52.546 --> 13:53.880
- Hypothetically.
- Hypothetically.

13:53.914 --> 13:56.349
Yeah, before I snatched up Dave,
I saw him

13:56.383 --> 13:59.219
having this knockdown,
drag-out argument

13:59.253 --> 14:01.855
with some tall guy
outside his apartment house.

14:01.889 --> 14:03.890
So the guy says to Dave,

14:03.924 --> 14:06.059
"hey, you better come through,
like you promised,

14:06.093 --> 14:08.928
or there's gonna be
serious consequences."

14:11.398 --> 14:12.932
Admit it...
he's not so bad of a guy.

14:12.967 --> 14:14.968
[Sighs] Castle,
just because his alibi held

14:15.002 --> 14:17.203
and he paid for lunch doesn't
make him a great humanitarian.

14:17.238 --> 14:18.638
He kills people for a living.

14:18.672 --> 14:20.406
Yes, but without
people like him,

14:20.441 --> 14:22.375
people like us
would be out of a job.

14:22.409 --> 14:24.143
Now, what's our next move?

14:24.178 --> 14:25.745
Locate and identify
this mystery man?

14:25.779 --> 14:27.046
No. That's <i>our</i> next move.

14:27.081 --> 14:28.815
<i>Your</i> next move is to go home.

14:28.849 --> 14:30.783
Beckett doesn't want you
working the case. I'm sorry.

14:30.818 --> 14:31.885
No. Uh, I get it.
Totally understand.

14:31.919 --> 14:35.188
I'll circle back 'round
and, uh, update my client.

[Elevator bell dings, door

14:38.592 --> 14:41.194
- That's...
- Yeah. That's too much.

14:45.032 --> 14:46.099
[Knock on door]

14:46.133 --> 14:49.102
O Captain, my Captain.

14:49.136 --> 14:51.004
Carl. Hey.

14:51.038 --> 14:53.006
Thank you
for coming up from CSU...

14:53.040 --> 14:56.109
I need you to give me a rundown
of narcotic signatures...

14:56.143 --> 14:58.111
specifically heroin.

14:58.145 --> 15:02.415
Basically, every batch of heroin
is like a snowflake.

15:02.449 --> 15:04.117
No two are alike.

15:04.151 --> 15:06.986
To determine if samples
are from the same batch, we run

15:07.021 --> 15:09.789
a chromatographic impurity
signature profile analysis.

15:09.823 --> 15:10.657
Okay.

15:10.691 --> 15:13.826
Um, let's say
I have a sample of heroin

15:13.861 --> 15:15.662
and I compare it
to another sample,

15:15.696 --> 15:17.096
and that'll help me determine

15:17.131 --> 15:18.998
whether they originated
from the same source?

15:19.033 --> 15:20.500
Exactamundo.

15:21.231 --> 15:23.102
Thank you. That's all I needed.

15:25.984 --> 15:28.441
- What's up, Carl?
- Hey.

15:28.475 --> 15:30.543
Hey, what are you meeting
with CSU's narcotics guy for?

15:30.578 --> 15:32.312
You know, espo,
I do have other cases

15:32.346 --> 15:34.013
that I have to supervise.

15:34.048 --> 15:34.881
My apologies, Capitan.

15:34.915 --> 15:37.717
So, any luck
on finding that mystery man?

15:37.751 --> 15:40.019
Ryan's scrubbing street-cam
footage near David's apartment.

15:40.054 --> 15:43.122
But, yo, I think
we're missing something here.

15:43.157 --> 15:44.123
What do you mean?

15:44.158 --> 15:45.892
Well, if Dave was a scam artist,

15:45.926 --> 15:47.894
he is the oddest one
I ever heard of.

15:47.928 --> 15:49.985
I mean, yes, he was exhibiting
con-man behavior,

15:50.005 --> 15:51.698
but to what end?

15:51.732 --> 15:53.533
Uh, to rip people off.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.702
Who? His wife?

15:55.736 --> 15:57.003
She didn't come from money.

15:57.037 --> 15:58.838
The priest
took a vow of poverty.

15:58.873 --> 16:01.441
And the union guy... Dave never
asked him for a payoff.

16:01.475 --> 16:02.942
Okay, that's a good point.

16:02.977 --> 16:05.011
So what's the upside
to Dave's cons?

16:05.045 --> 16:06.079
[Knock on door] Hey.

16:06.113 --> 16:09.449
So, I I.D.'d our mystery man
who threatened Dave.

16:09.483 --> 16:12.852

He's a convicted scam artist.

16:14.555 --> 16:16.055
including one
with a deadly weapon.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.957
You know, maybe Eric and Dave
were working a con together

16:17.992 --> 16:19.559
and something went wrong.

16:19.593 --> 16:20.894
Any idea where Eric is now?

16:20.928 --> 16:22.796
Yeah. I pinged his cell.
We got a location.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.164
Let's go pick him up.

Yeah, this is Captain Beckett.

16:39.847 --> 16:40.914
Do we still have
the seized heroin

16:40.948 --> 16:42.081
from the Vulcan Simmons case?

16:42.116 --> 16:43.316
Hang on. Let me check.

16:43.350 --> 16:44.671
Yeah, I'll hold.

16:48.456 --> 16:49.556
Yes, we do.

16:49.590 --> 16:51.090
Good.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.992
That's all I needed.

16:57.131 --> 16:59.199
All right.
Well, thanks anyway for trying.

17:01.969 --> 17:05.238
There's no more slots open
for the sergeant's exam.

17:05.271 --> 17:06.105
Damn!

17:06.140 --> 17:08.575
Well, I guess
we're gonna have to wait

17:08.608 --> 17:10.276
till the next slot opens up.

17:10.310 --> 17:11.911
[Glass clatters] Yeah.

Whoa! Geez!

Castle.

17:29.964 --> 17:31.865
Hey.

17:31.899 --> 17:33.366
I was just going to that, uh...

17:33.400 --> 17:35.535
Just going to the bodega there.

17:35.569 --> 17:37.637
Pick you something up...
little slim Jim, yoo-hoo?

17:37.671 --> 17:39.439
Castle, how did you know
that we were here?

17:55.122 --> 17:56.222
Did you put this tracker on me

17:56.257 --> 17:57.423
when you gave me
that awkward hug?

17:57.458 --> 18:00.426
I have no idea what that is.
But I'll take it off your hands.

18:00.461 --> 18:02.228
Yeah, sure. Here you go.

18:03.464 --> 18:04.964
Oops.

18:04.999 --> 18:06.399
You know I can find that, right?

18:08.202 --> 18:09.969
Hey, guys. It's Eric.

18:15.801 --> 18:19.245
Bob: But I never really had
a fair shot in life, you know?

18:19.280 --> 18:21.147
Uh, my parents...

18:21.181 --> 18:25.385
they died in a plane crash
when I was a kid.

18:26.394 --> 18:28.321
That's a lie.

18:28.355 --> 18:30.890
Actually,
my parents live in Denver.

18:32.059 --> 18:33.526
Cleveland.

18:33.561 --> 18:36.029
Anyway, uh, my name's Steve.

18:36.063 --> 18:37.931

18:37.965 --> 18:39.232
Thanks, <i>Bob.</i>

18:41.035 --> 18:42.869
[Sighs]

18:42.903 --> 18:46.806
Before we close, friends,
today is a sad day,

18:46.840 --> 18:49.175
because we just lost
one of our own...

18:49.209 --> 18:51.277
Dave Johnson.

18:52.413 --> 18:56.921
His is a cautionary tale,
because last night...

18:57.318 --> 19:00.286
Dave's lies
finally caught up with him.

19:00.954 --> 19:04.490
Let's take a moment for Dave.

27:12.058 --> 27:14.326
I gave him spiritual guidance.

27:14.361 --> 27:16.328
And which part of that guidance

27:16.363 --> 27:19.098
included breaking and entering
at city hall?

27:23.437 --> 27:25.304
The blind priest just ran away.

27:28.675 --> 27:30.709
This cannot end well.

27:30.744 --> 27:32.378
- Hey!
- Hey, watch it!

27:32.412 --> 27:33.946
Huh.

27:35.415 --> 27:36.515
Should we...

27:36.550 --> 27:38.184
Damn it. Yes.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.025
What?!

27:46.059 --> 27:48.160
Beckett:
So, let me get this straight...

27:48.195 --> 27:51.597
you got parkoured
by a blind priest?

27:51.631 --> 27:53.866
I'd say the blindness
is under dispute.

27:53.900 --> 27:54.767
Uh-huh.

27:54.801 --> 27:56.602
And what about the fact
that he's 60?

27:56.636 --> 27:58.404
Was he faking his age, too?

27:58.438 --> 27:59.705
60 is the new 20.

27:59.739 --> 28:01.340
Did you call
just to bust my chops?

28:01.374 --> 28:02.508
Yeah. Pretty much.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.043
[Elevator bell dings]

28:05.479 --> 28:08.914
Um, all right, Speedy,
I got to go.

28:08.949 --> 28:10.783
Make sure
you stretch before bed.

28:10.817 --> 28:12.751
[Click, dial tone]

28:12.786 --> 28:14.086
They got the priest.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.120
How do you know?

28:15.155 --> 28:17.022
Beckett was having too much fun.

28:17.057 --> 28:17.923
Wait.

28:17.958 --> 28:20.526
Beckett was having fun...
with <i>me.</i>

28:21.661 --> 28:22.895
Score.

28:22.929 --> 28:25.397
Imagine how much fun she's gonna
have with the runaway priest.

28:25.432 --> 28:27.766
Arguello:
Can I be honest with you?

28:27.801 --> 28:30.035
I went blind
to get out of Tampa.

28:31.438 --> 28:33.939
It was miserable down there.

28:37.087 --> 28:40.479
The humidity
was just oppressive.

28:40.514 --> 28:44.083
When I learned that priests
with certain disabilities

28:44.117 --> 28:49.421
have their pick of assignments,
I-I didn't even hesitate.

28:51.157 --> 28:52.658
I don't understand
what any of this

28:52.692 --> 28:55.060
has to do
with Dave Johnson's murder.

28:55.095 --> 28:55.895
[Sighs]

28:55.929 --> 28:59.131
Dave's lying
was a terrible burden...

28:59.165 --> 29:02.601
one that he'd been carrying
since childhood.

29:02.636 --> 29:06.305
I offered him
a way to make amends.

29:06.339 --> 29:08.674
And this is you
still being honest?

29:08.708 --> 29:10.409
Yes.

29:10.443 --> 29:13.012
Dave's lying torpedoed
his accounting career.

29:13.046 --> 29:15.481
That's why he was working
as a janitor at city hall,

29:15.515 --> 29:18.884
pretending to be
a reclusive author.

29:20.220 --> 29:23.822
My parish was about to miss
a payment to the city,

29:23.857 --> 29:27.526
due to my...
mismanagement of funds.

29:27.561 --> 29:31.430
I simply asked Dave to
sneak into the accounting office

29:31.464 --> 29:35.367
and log the payment
into the computer as received.

29:35.402 --> 29:38.203
Ohhh! So this wasn't
about making amends.

29:38.238 --> 29:40.406
This was about helping <i>you.</i>

29:41.030 --> 29:44.543
When Dave was
hacked into the city budget,

29:44.578 --> 29:47.713
he found evidence
of a secret slush fund...

29:47.747 --> 29:50.950
$10 million siphoned
from social programs

29:50.984 --> 29:53.018
to line someone's pocket.

29:53.053 --> 29:56.121
It was a lie
Dave couldn't stomach,

29:56.156 --> 29:58.824
so he vowed to expose it.

29:58.858 --> 29:59.825
And you believe

29:59.859 --> 30:03.362
that whoever controlled
this alleged slush fund

30:03.396 --> 30:05.564
discovered Dave's intrusion?

30:05.599 --> 30:08.567
And they killed him for it.

30:12.005 --> 30:13.005
Ryan: So, what do you think?

30:13.040 --> 30:14.719
It tracks with what our victim
told his sponsor.

30:14.739 --> 30:17.151
And with Dave's questions
about union kickbacks.

30:17.171 --> 30:19.858
It doesn't matter.
It's non-actionable.

30:19.878 --> 30:22.280
There's no way we're gonna get
a subpoena for city hall

30:22.314 --> 30:24.816
based on hearsay
told to a not-blind priest

30:24.836 --> 30:26.541
from a pathological liar.

30:26.585 --> 30:27.485
I guess Dave was right...

30:27.519 --> 30:29.183
no one believes
the boy who cries wolf.

30:29.203 --> 30:30.077
Ryan: So what are you saying...
we give up?

30:30.097 --> 30:31.656
Because that's not
the Beckett that I know.

30:31.690 --> 30:32.957
No, I'm not saying
that we should give up.

30:32.991 --> 30:35.259
What I am saying is, I've been a
captain for about five minutes.

30:35.294 --> 30:36.728
If we take this to the D.A.,

30:36.762 --> 30:38.930
nobody's gonna
take me seriously <i>ever.</i>

30:38.964 --> 30:40.164
Okay. We'll get proof.

30:40.199 --> 30:41.532
Money's gone.

30:41.567 --> 30:43.368
Even if there <i>is</i>
<i>a secret slush fund,</i>

30:43.402 --> 30:45.937
the person controlling it
killed Dave to cover it up,

30:45.971 --> 30:48.039
buried the money deep,
covered his tracks.

30:48.073 --> 30:49.173
So what are we supposed to do?

30:49.208 --> 30:51.075
We do our homework.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.212
We find out who could pull off
a slush fund in the city budget,

30:54.246 --> 30:56.280
which means
we have to talk to someone

30:56.315 --> 30:58.416
with contacts and resources
in city hall.

30:58.450 --> 31:02.086
Someone who's best friends
with the mayor?

31:02.121 --> 31:04.222
Someone like... Castle?

31:05.958 --> 31:08.359
He's gonna be so smug
about this.

31:08.394 --> 31:12.263
I'm sorry. Did you say
you... needed my help?

31:12.298 --> 31:13.598
Castle.

31:13.632 --> 31:14.766
You heard her say it, right?

31:14.800 --> 31:16.434
- Dad, let it go.
- Thank you.

31:16.468 --> 31:18.937
Castle, do you have
the intel we need or not?

31:18.971 --> 31:20.838
[Laughs] Tell her.

31:20.873 --> 31:22.407
[Sighs]
When I was in middle school,

31:22.441 --> 31:24.108
dad did four months
of extensive research

31:24.143 --> 31:26.010
into the inner workings
of city finance

31:26.045 --> 31:27.078
for a novel he was writing.

31:27.112 --> 31:28.913
Yes, but then I realized
that that novel would be

31:28.948 --> 31:31.082
the most boring novel
in the history of novels,

31:31.116 --> 31:33.351
so I wrote a Derek Storm book instead.

31:33.385 --> 31:35.019
Okay, so, then,
you have a pretty good idea

31:35.054 --> 31:36.087
of which city officials

31:36.121 --> 31:38.356
would be able to hide
a $10 million slush fund.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.858
Yes,
and it's a pretty small list.

31:40.893 --> 31:42.727
The only people with access
to the entire budget

31:42.761 --> 31:45.063
are the comptroller,
the mayor's chief of staff,

31:45.097 --> 31:46.531
and the deputy chief.

31:46.565 --> 31:47.765
Stephen Reed...
the guy we met with.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.567
I know for a fact
that the chief of staff

31:49.602 --> 31:50.535
is in London with the mayor.

31:50.569 --> 31:51.869
Esposito: And I made
a few discreet calls.

31:51.904 --> 31:55.139
The city comptroller was at a
fundraiser when Dave was shot.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.108
Which means
Reed is our main suspect.

31:57.142 --> 31:58.810
Okay, so, how do we
get this guy?

31:58.844 --> 32:02.080
May I suggest
the "midnight run" stratagem?

32:02.114 --> 32:03.781
- The what?
- "Midnight run."

32:03.816 --> 32:05.883
It's one of the top five
buddy movies of all time.

32:05.918 --> 32:07.619
And you're suggesting
we base our legal strategy

32:07.653 --> 32:09.087
upon this buddy-cop movie?

32:09.121 --> 32:10.288
No, he's right. It could work.

32:10.322 --> 32:11.456
At the end of the movie,

32:11.490 --> 32:13.958
Robert de Niro tricks a mobster
into taking computer discs

32:13.993 --> 32:15.893
he thinks
contain evidence against him,

32:15.928 --> 32:17.895
and just by showing up
to take them,

32:17.930 --> 32:20.465
the mobster is committing
conspiracy to obstruct justice.

32:20.499 --> 32:22.133
If we can trick Reed
the same way,

32:22.167 --> 32:24.469
then we've got all the leverage
we need to expose the slush fund

32:24.503 --> 32:25.970
and go after him
for Dave's murder.

32:26.005 --> 32:29.107
But, Kate,
you can't be involved.

32:29.141 --> 32:29.907
Why not?

32:29.942 --> 32:30.775
Because if Reed isn't involved,

32:30.809 --> 32:32.610
then all this
blows up in our face,

32:32.645 --> 32:33.911
and you take the hit.

32:33.946 --> 32:35.113
And you don't need that.

32:35.147 --> 32:37.015
Let us shield you, Captain.

32:37.049 --> 32:39.117
[Sighs] Okay.

32:39.151 --> 32:41.986
I'm out... for now.

32:42.021 --> 32:43.187
Thanks.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.822
[Door opens]

32:45.791 --> 32:47.125
[Door closes]

32:47.159 --> 32:48.860
Okay, how do we do this?

32:48.894 --> 32:53.197
First, I'm gonna need to borrow
your blind priest.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.866
Mr. Reed?

32:54.900 --> 32:56.634
Mr. Reed!

32:56.669 --> 32:58.102
- Father.
- Oh!

32:58.137 --> 32:59.070
What are you doing here?

32:59.104 --> 33:01.472
Uh, your office told me
where to find you.

33:01.507 --> 33:03.508
Ah. Well, sorry, Father.

33:03.542 --> 33:05.376
I'm appointment-only,
even for the clergy.

33:05.411 --> 33:08.179
I don't think
you want your office to hear

33:08.213 --> 33:10.515
what we're about to discuss.

33:10.549 --> 33:13.051
Dave Johnson
was one of my flock.

33:13.085 --> 33:16.888
Who got fired for being
where he didn't belong.

33:16.922 --> 33:18.856
Yes, but while he was there,
Dave told me

33:18.891 --> 33:22.160
he stumbled across
your little secret account.

33:22.194 --> 33:25.063
Uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:25.097 --> 33:26.631
And, uh,
my hot dog's waiting, so...

33:26.665 --> 33:29.334
Dave was a cautious man,
Mr. Reed.

33:29.368 --> 33:31.703
He took proof of the account...

33:31.737 --> 33:33.071
proof that he left
on a thumb drive

33:33.105 --> 33:35.873
on the altar of my church
behind the chalice

33:35.908 --> 33:37.408
before he was killed.

33:37.443 --> 33:42.213
I give you this information
as a gift.

33:42.247 --> 33:45.149
If you were to make
the church's debt disappear,

33:45.184 --> 33:48.486
as a token of appreciation,

33:48.520 --> 33:51.189
well, the lord
would be grateful.

33:51.223 --> 33:52.824
Well... [Clears throat]

33:52.858 --> 33:56.027
Like I said... Father...

33:56.061 --> 33:58.262
I got no clue
what you're talking about.

33:58.297 --> 34:01.099
Don't ever come see me again.

34:01.133 --> 34:03.134
Bless you, my child.

34:03.802 --> 34:04.769
Think it worked?

34:04.803 --> 34:05.937
Of course it worked.

34:05.971 --> 34:07.038
We'll know tonight.

34:07.072 --> 34:08.072
That it worked.

34:28.293 --> 34:29.893
[Door opens]

34:29.928 --> 34:32.163
[Door closes]

34:49.248 --> 34:50.882
All right.

34:50.916 --> 34:52.315
You know what to do.

Are you sure about this?

34:54.152 --> 34:55.719
Go big or go home,

34:55.754 --> 34:58.790
except... in this case,
home might be jail.

Is that him?

35:18.377 --> 35:20.211
I don't know.

35:38.697 --> 35:40.298
It's got to be him.

Damn it!

35:55.881 --> 35:57.715
Where'd he go? We're screwed.

35:57.749 --> 35:59.317
Catching him
with that empty thumb drive

35:59.351 --> 36:00.952
was our whole conspiracy charge.

36:00.986 --> 36:01.953
Did it work?

36:01.987 --> 36:03.754
Did <i>what</i> work?

36:04.923 --> 36:07.191
Are you the one
that turned the lights out?

36:07.226 --> 36:08.526
I-I told her to do that.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.728
Why in the hell
would you do that?

36:10.762 --> 36:12.129
Well, I thought
our "midnight run" stratagem

36:12.164 --> 36:13.231
needed a little twist.

36:13.265 --> 36:15.833
Trust me, guys... if this works,
we're gonna have him

36:15.868 --> 36:18.035
on a whole lot more
than just obstruction.

36:18.070 --> 36:19.070
What if it doesn't?

36:40.978 --> 36:42.746
[Computer beeps]

36:44.181 --> 36:45.548
<i>Hi.</i>

36:45.583 --> 36:48.284

<i>The moment you plugged this

[Key clacking] By now, that virus
has searched <i>your keystroke history</i>

<i>Oops.</i>

37:05.202 --> 37:07.237
[Grunts]

37:12.643 --> 37:14.944
So, I guess we can add
destruction of city property

37:14.979 --> 37:16.327
to those charges.

37:19.807 --> 37:22.018
I didn't kill him.

37:22.052 --> 37:24.354
Why would I? He was a liar.

37:24.388 --> 37:26.136
Plus, I have an alibi.

37:26.156 --> 37:29.025
Oh, let me guess...
you were home, alone, asleep?

37:29.060 --> 37:31.561
No, I was out
playing poker with your boss,

37:31.595 --> 37:33.396
the police commissioner.

37:33.964 --> 37:35.899
Which means
your killer's still out there.

37:35.933 --> 37:37.901
So, what do we know?

37:37.935 --> 37:40.337
Dave Johnson...
he was a pathological liar

37:40.371 --> 37:42.439
who stumbled upon
a secret slush fund

37:42.473 --> 37:44.174
and then decided to expose it.

37:44.208 --> 37:46.609
And everyone connected to that
alibi'd out.

37:46.644 --> 37:48.578
So we've got nothing?

37:48.612 --> 37:52.382
No. We can safely assume
that Dave was killed over a lie.

37:52.416 --> 37:53.950
[Groans] Which lie, then?

37:53.984 --> 37:55.752
Well, if I was writing this,

37:55.786 --> 37:57.620
I would fall back on a theme.

37:57.655 --> 38:00.824
A lie is a betrayal of trust.

38:02.927 --> 38:05.862
And there is
no greater betrayal...

38:05.896 --> 38:07.597
than a lie in a marriage.

38:08.933 --> 38:09.866
Yeah, well, that might be,

38:09.900 --> 38:12.802
but Wendy thought
that Dave was P.J. Moffet.

38:12.837 --> 38:15.505
What if she found out he wasn't?

38:16.120 --> 38:18.875
You have this all wrong.
I didn't kill Dave.

38:18.909 --> 38:21.711
We found fragments
of stained glass in your car.

38:21.746 --> 38:25.315
It matches the broken glass
found in the church.

38:25.349 --> 38:27.183
[Chuckles]

38:30.121 --> 38:31.020
I only married Dave

38:31.055 --> 38:33.089
because he told me
he was a famous author.

38:33.124 --> 38:35.825
I-I just... I thought
I was gonna be living in luxury.

38:35.860 --> 38:39.954
And... and he insisted
that we live in poverty,

38:40.190 --> 38:41.831
even though he had millions.

38:41.866 --> 38:43.600
Only, he was lying.

38:43.634 --> 38:45.377
And you found out.

38:46.036 --> 38:47.804
You know,
what I don't understand is,

38:47.838 --> 38:49.773
why would you kill him?

38:49.807 --> 38:51.841
Why didn't you
just divorce the guy?

38:51.876 --> 38:54.411
Because he had to pay.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.312
For what he cost me.

38:56.347 --> 38:58.748
I could have married Ben Shapiro,

38:58.783 --> 39:00.984
the carpet king of Nassau County.

39:01.018 --> 39:05.955
But instead, I married a liar

39:05.990 --> 39:08.658
who ruined my life.

39:08.692 --> 39:10.093
[Sighs]

39:10.127 --> 39:12.829
Wendy Johnson,
you are under arrest

39:12.863 --> 39:15.064
for the murder of your husband.

39:18.469 --> 39:19.836
Wait. Wait!

39:19.870 --> 39:21.438
Oh.

39:21.472 --> 39:23.840
In a few days,
you're gonna receive an invoice.

39:23.874 --> 39:26.109
I'd appreciate prompt payment.

39:31.594 --> 39:33.283
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:33.317 --> 39:34.984
Hey, hey! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

39:35.019 --> 39:36.820
Listen. [Sighs]

39:36.854 --> 39:38.555
I'm gonna call 1PP,

39:38.589 --> 39:40.156
and I'm gonna ask them
to give you

39:40.191 --> 39:42.892
that last sergeant's exam slot
instead of me.

39:42.927 --> 39:44.327
I don't need your charity.

39:44.361 --> 39:45.195
It's not charity.

39:45.229 --> 39:46.830
[Scoffs] Hey!

39:46.864 --> 39:48.064
Hey, I did wrong by you.

39:51.035 --> 39:53.503
I'm trying to make amends here.

39:54.572 --> 39:57.040
Hey, bozos.

39:57.074 --> 39:59.309
Did it ever occur to you
that your captain

39:59.343 --> 40:02.011
could pull some strings
and get you <i>both</i> a slot?

40:03.848 --> 40:05.048
Did you?

40:05.354 --> 40:06.883
Yeah.

40:06.917 --> 40:08.583
And I expect you to pass.

40:09.753 --> 40:11.654
Good job today.

40:11.689 --> 40:13.223
- Thanks, Captain.
- Thanks, Captain.

40:17.962 --> 40:18.928
All right.

40:18.963 --> 40:20.029
Good luck, man.

40:24.935 --> 40:27.003
Castle?

40:34.204 --> 40:36.379
Relax. Doesn't mean anything.

40:36.413 --> 40:39.215
It's just a little
congratulatory coffee

40:39.250 --> 40:41.017
after solving a tough case.

40:56.166 --> 40:56.900
Wow.

40:56.934 --> 40:59.215
I can never make it like you.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.200
Even though you taught me how.

41:01.220 --> 41:02.505
That's 'cause I lied.

41:05.509 --> 41:08.659
There's a, uh...
Special ingredient.

41:08.679 --> 41:10.213
I kept it a secret.

41:10.790 --> 41:12.482
Really?

41:12.516 --> 41:13.583
What is it?

41:13.617 --> 41:15.118
Well, now, if I told you that,

41:15.152 --> 41:16.920
you might not need me anymore.

41:18.149 --> 41:20.423
Then don't tell me.

41:21.927 --> 41:23.560
And since we're being honest,

41:23.594 --> 41:26.029
there's something
that I have to tell you.

41:30.849 --> 41:32.468
I hated Moffet's book.

41:32.503 --> 41:33.703
What?! Wha...

41:35.706 --> 41:36.873
Why didn't you tell me?

41:36.907 --> 41:38.942
Because you gave it to me
when we first started dating,

41:38.976 --> 41:40.443
and I knew
it was important to you,

41:40.477 --> 41:43.112
so... I lied.

41:43.147 --> 41:44.247
[Chuckles]

41:45.215 --> 41:48.284
[Cellphone ringing]

41:48.859 --> 41:51.020
I'm sorry. I have to get this.

41:51.055 --> 41:53.189
[Ringing continues]

41:53.223 --> 41:54.090
Okay.

41:58.353 --> 41:59.796
Have a good night.

41:59.830 --> 42:01.464
[Ringing continues] You too.

42:06.637 --> 42:08.805
[Ringing continues]

42:11.938 --> 42:13.715
Vikram. Hey.

42:13.735 --> 42:15.211
Did you get the test results
on the heroin

42:15.245 --> 42:17.180
from the Vulcan Simmons case?

42:19.423 --> 42:20.850
Okay.

42:20.870 --> 42:22.218
Now we can get to work.
