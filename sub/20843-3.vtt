Announcer:
<i>Previously on "MasterChef."</i>

00:06.279 --> 00:08.450
<i>The 40 best</i>
<i>home cooks in America</i>

00:08.450 --> 00:11.089
<i>faced off</i>
<i>in the culinary challenges...</i>

00:11.089 --> 00:12.592
Watch very carefully.

00:12.592 --> 00:14.796
I'm only doing this once.

00:14.796 --> 00:16.466
<i>...of their lives.</i>

00:16.466 --> 00:19.105
This is the battle
of the tacos.

00:19.105 --> 00:20.608
‐ Salmon...
‐ Cupcakes.

00:20.608 --> 00:22.278
Oh, lord.

00:22.278 --> 00:24.616
‐ <i>In the end...</i>
‐ That is remarkable.

00:24.616 --> 00:27.822
‐ <i>only the very best...</i>
‐ It's delicious.

00:27.822 --> 00:30.528
<i>...claim the coveted</i>
<i>white apron</i>

00:30.528 --> 00:32.799
<i>and a place</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

00:34.736 --> 00:36.874
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:36.874 --> 00:39.211
‐ Gordon: <i>A grocery bag.</i>
‐ Christina: <i>You couldn't level</i>
<i>the playing field</i>

00:39.211 --> 00:40.815
anymore than
we have tonight.

00:40.815 --> 00:45.157
<i>The top 20 take on their first</i>
<i>mystery box challenge.</i>

00:45.157 --> 00:48.898
‐ This is pretty terrifying.
‐ Steady hand, Sam.

00:48.898 --> 00:50.935
‐ <i>They've won their aprons...</i>
‐ Why kebab?

00:50.935 --> 00:53.941
‐ <i>Now they fight...</i>
‐ Heather, just do what I do
and ignore them.

00:53.941 --> 00:56.547
‐ <i>...to keep them.</i>
‐ Is this a joke for you?

00:56.547 --> 00:59.251
Take it serious...
or take your apron off.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.333
( giggling )

01:23.333 --> 01:25.571
( cheering )

01:27.676 --> 01:29.846
Welcome, guys.
Come on down, please.
Let's go.

01:32.886 --> 01:34.723
It is amazing to be
in the top 20.

01:34.723 --> 01:37.729
Just last week I was
preaching in Detroit,

01:37.729 --> 01:40.768
<i>and today I'm in</i>
<i>the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:43.306
Yes! Let's go!

01:43.306 --> 01:44.776
I'm here to change my life.

01:44.776 --> 01:46.613
I'm 43 years old.

01:46.613 --> 01:49.251
I've raised my children.
I've been married before.

01:49.251 --> 01:52.224
I'm ready to do me now.
It's my turn.

01:52.224 --> 01:54.495
Dino:
<i>I thought I had a nice kitchen</i>
<i>back in Brooklyn.</i>

01:54.495 --> 01:56.432
But walking into this
MasterChef kitchen,

01:56.432 --> 01:59.940
it makes mine look
like a hot dog stand.

01:59.940 --> 02:02.211
<i>It's beautiful,</i>
<i>it's elaborate, it's detailed.</i>

02:02.211 --> 02:05.217
<i>There's pretty much</i>
<i>every piece of equipment</i>
<i>you could ever need.</i>

02:05.217 --> 02:06.553
<i>I want to go</i>
<i>"Edward Scissorhands" on it</i>

02:06.553 --> 02:08.858
and go crazy with everything
on my fingers.

02:08.858 --> 02:10.728
There's just so much things
I want to use in here.

02:12.899 --> 02:16.974
Welcome to the one and only
MasterChef kitchen.

02:16.974 --> 02:21.750
You are the top 20 home cooks
in all of America.

02:21.750 --> 02:25.490
America's next master chef
is standing in front of us
right now.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.931
And with that title
comes incredible prizes.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.570
For starters,
a quarter of a million
dollars.

02:31.570 --> 02:35.578
‐ And a guaranteed spot
on the next MasterChef cruise.
‐ Yes!

02:35.578 --> 02:38.416
And of course,
there's the greatest
prize of all‐‐

02:38.416 --> 02:40.922
the MasterChef trophy.

02:40.922 --> 02:43.426
‐ Christina: Yes.
‐ ( cheering )

02:43.426 --> 02:47.167
Yachecia:
Beautiful. Whoo!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.338
All right, home cooks,
there's only one way

02:49.338 --> 02:52.277
to kick off
this competition.

02:52.277 --> 02:55.116
The iconic
mystery box challenge.

02:58.858 --> 03:00.393
All of you,
at the count of three,

03:00.393 --> 03:02.431
lift your boxes.

03:02.431 --> 03:03.634
Whoo!

03:03.634 --> 03:06.607
Gordon:
One, two...

03:06.607 --> 03:09.411
three. Lift.

03:09.411 --> 03:12.518
‐ ( laughter )
‐ Grocery bag.

03:12.518 --> 03:13.787
All right.

03:13.787 --> 03:16.927
Gordon:
A brown grocery bag.

03:16.927 --> 03:21.837
Why don't you go ahead and see
what's inside your bags?

03:21.837 --> 03:25.343
‐ Ooh.
‐ Ooh la la.

03:25.343 --> 03:26.713
Broccoli...

03:26.713 --> 03:29.351
I imagine everything looks
pretty familiar.

03:29.351 --> 03:30.988
Oh, yeah.

03:30.988 --> 03:33.560
Christina:
And that's because these are
12 of the most common items

03:33.560 --> 03:36.399
found on any American
home cook's shopping list.

03:36.399 --> 03:37.869
Bananas...

03:37.869 --> 03:40.741
Your ingredients include
chicken breast, ground beef,

03:40.741 --> 03:43.814
‐ Rice...
‐ potatoes, canned tomatoes,

03:43.814 --> 03:46.586
‐ Bacon.
‐ Carrots, white cheddar cheese,

03:46.586 --> 03:49.859
green apples, and chocolate.

03:49.859 --> 03:54.335
You'll also have access
to the standard MasterChef
staple pantry box.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.372
Tonight, you'll have
just one hour

03:56.372 --> 03:59.345
to take the most
popular ingredients
across all of America,

03:59.345 --> 04:01.817
and make us
a phenomenal dish.

04:01.817 --> 04:04.121
Win this challenge,
and you will get

04:04.121 --> 04:07.127
a huge advantage
moving forward.

04:07.127 --> 04:11.369
Your 60 minutes starts now!

04:12.872 --> 04:15.143
Go!

04:15.143 --> 04:17.715
Larger measuring cups,
larger measuring cups...

04:17.715 --> 04:19.586
All right.
Let's get it going here.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.422
Right, tonight's first
mystery box challenge.

04:21.422 --> 04:24.261
A grocery bag. I mean,
some of the most incredible
products

04:24.261 --> 04:26.566
anywhere in America that
every home can recognize.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.403
Christina:
I mean, those are the basics.

04:28.403 --> 04:32.244
You couldn't level
the playing field any more
than we have tonight.

04:32.244 --> 04:34.381
This is so cool.

04:34.381 --> 04:35.885
So I'm doing
five things today.

04:35.885 --> 04:37.054
I'm making
the ultimate breakfast.

04:37.054 --> 04:39.559
Chicken apple sausage,
buttermilk biscuits and gravy,

04:39.559 --> 04:42.297
soft scrambled egg,
and a little hash browns.

04:42.297 --> 04:44.401
My grandmother always made
a really big breakfast

04:44.401 --> 04:45.905
every single solitary
time and so...

04:45.905 --> 04:49.579
I like the extra elements
so you're full.

04:49.579 --> 04:51.115
Never know how long
it's gonna be till lunch.

04:55.090 --> 04:59.566
I am making
a crispy‐skin, oil‐poached,
bacon chicken breast

04:59.566 --> 05:02.204
with broccoli
and an apple slaw.

05:02.204 --> 05:03.941
This is me paying homage
to my parents.

05:03.941 --> 05:08.216
They had this amazing
ability to feed four kids
within 20 minutes

05:08.216 --> 05:10.253
because they're doctors
and they got home very late.

05:10.253 --> 05:14.228
And they used to make this
all the time.

05:14.228 --> 05:16.298
I'm gonna make something
my kids love a lot.

05:16.298 --> 05:19.037
I'm gonna do
a curry chicken breast
over a bed of rice,

05:19.037 --> 05:22.244
and I'm gonna fry some
banana down in some flour.

05:22.244 --> 05:24.081
My husband's Indian,
so this is something

05:24.081 --> 05:26.152
that's traditional to him
that I make all the time.

05:26.152 --> 05:28.724
So I'm making this recipe
with love.

05:28.724 --> 05:31.897
Gordon:
Just under 40 minutes
to go, guys.

05:31.897 --> 05:35.403
Okay, so, Brien,
what is about your experience

05:35.403 --> 05:36.806
that makes you
such a competitor?

05:36.806 --> 05:38.510
I grew up
in Northern California,
a town called Redding,

05:38.510 --> 05:40.079
and we'd go fly fishing.

05:40.079 --> 05:43.085
My father, he'd
take me out fly fishing
almost every weekend.

05:43.085 --> 05:45.290
And we'd stop by
the local deli

05:45.290 --> 05:46.826
and get whatever we wanted.

05:46.826 --> 05:50.935
So I'm gonna be making
a deli‐inspired broccoli
and bacon slaw,

05:50.935 --> 05:52.304
<i>with a little fried chicken</i>

05:52.304 --> 05:55.945
and some fried potatoes
we have back home
called "jo jos."

05:55.945 --> 05:57.848
So it's gonna be an ode
to the fishing trip
with my father.

05:57.848 --> 05:59.719
I love it.
Keep your eye
on the prize.

05:59.719 --> 06:03.459
‐ Keep your eye
on that clock. Good luck.
‐ Thank you so much, chefs.

06:03.459 --> 06:05.096
‐ Right, Sam.
‐ Yes.

06:05.096 --> 06:06.165
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

06:06.165 --> 06:07.935
I'm making meatloaf
and mashed potatoes.

06:07.935 --> 06:08.937
I'm a creative
writing teacher,

06:08.937 --> 06:10.340
and this is one
of the things

06:10.340 --> 06:11.943
that they're always
serving in the lunch room,
and‐‐

06:11.943 --> 06:13.513
‐ Yes.
‐ The kids think
it's sort of icky,

06:13.513 --> 06:15.851
so I'm taking it up
like three notches.

06:15.851 --> 06:19.692
I'm also Jewish, and so we do
a lot of fried chicken skin.
We call it gribenes.

06:19.692 --> 06:20.961
And so I'm doing
some of that action too.

06:20.961 --> 06:22.364
Where's the skin going?

06:22.364 --> 06:24.201
I'm gonna use the skin
to garnish the mashed potatoes.

06:24.201 --> 06:26.205
‐ Very posh.
‐ Well...

06:26.205 --> 06:27.875
Yeah?

06:27.875 --> 06:29.712
Can't wait to taste
that crispy chicken skin.
Good luck.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.528
So, Heather,
talk to me about
your dish.

06:37.528 --> 06:40.868
Uh, my mom's Peruvian,
so I'm making some
Peruvian rice

06:40.868 --> 06:43.540
and, like, a Latin‐inspired
chimichurri sauce
for my chicken.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.909
And then
I'm gonna fry it up.

06:44.909 --> 06:46.378
‐ All right, I love it.
‐ Great. So what do you think

06:46.378 --> 06:48.717
about this idea
of this grocery bag?

06:48.717 --> 06:50.219
Well, we didn't have
a lot of money growing up.

06:50.219 --> 06:52.758
So my mom would try to make
whatever she could

06:52.758 --> 06:54.094
using the ingredients
that she had.

06:54.094 --> 06:55.731
And so it's gonna be
an ode to my mother.

06:55.731 --> 06:57.334
Outstanding.
Keep your eye on the prize.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.737
Absolutely.
Thank you guys so much.

06:58.737 --> 06:59.772
‐ Of course.
‐ Good luck.

06:59.772 --> 07:01.375
Thank you.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.780
Right, Mark.
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

07:03.780 --> 07:05.651
So I'm a powerhouse guy,
so I need to start

07:05.651 --> 07:07.354
with a good breakfast
in the morning.

07:07.354 --> 07:10.326
‐ So it's gonna be
pancakes, eggs, bacon.
‐ Breakfast.

07:10.326 --> 07:11.563
I'm gonna do
a caramel sauce,

07:11.563 --> 07:13.834
and then I'm gonna
do a potato latke.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.038
Right. Do you not get
intimidated with all this
talent around here?

07:16.038 --> 07:18.877
I feel incredibly ready
to win this whole thing.

07:18.877 --> 07:21.716
‐ The whole competition, Mark?
‐ I didn't come here
to lose.

07:21.716 --> 07:24.321
‐ Make this breakfast
a breakfast to remember.
‐ I will, sir.

07:24.321 --> 07:25.691
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.738
‐ Hey, Jennifer.
‐ How's it going today?

07:32.738 --> 07:34.207
Jennifer, Louisiana's
in the house with you, right?

07:34.207 --> 07:36.111
Yes, yes,
it definitely it is today.

07:36.111 --> 07:38.917
I'm actually doing
a blackened chicken
with étouffée sauce

07:38.917 --> 07:40.420
with a vegetable medley.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.558
So I'm kind of doing,
like, something salty

07:42.558 --> 07:43.960
and some sweet.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.864
All right, so what makes you
such a fierce competitor

07:45.864 --> 07:47.735
that's gonna beat all these
other 19 home cooks?

07:47.735 --> 07:49.371
I think it has to do
with since I was a kid

07:49.371 --> 07:50.607
I learned from
the best people,

07:50.607 --> 07:52.143
and then the people
in my family.

07:52.143 --> 07:54.247
You can't make up soul,
so...

07:54.247 --> 07:55.818
‐ That's true.
‐ Put it on a plate, girl.

07:55.818 --> 07:57.120
Yeah, I will.
I promise y'all.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.957
Thank y'all.

07:58.957 --> 08:01.863
Just over
five minutes to go.

08:01.863 --> 08:05.504
Let's get it on.

08:05.504 --> 08:06.706
Baby doll.

08:06.706 --> 08:08.844
Wow, I mean, first of all,
this is incredible

08:08.844 --> 08:10.581
because I've never seen
such intensity

08:10.581 --> 08:12.852
across the first
mystery box challenge.

08:12.852 --> 08:15.891
‐ Oops.
‐ Mark is doing his take
on an American breakfast,

08:15.891 --> 08:17.427
but he wants to sort
of elevate that take.

08:17.427 --> 08:19.397
‐ Okay.
‐ Ooh.

08:19.397 --> 08:22.805
Yachecia, she is doing
biscuits and gravy.

08:22.805 --> 08:24.074
But hold on,
she's gonna do

08:24.074 --> 08:25.744
a cheddar scrambled eggs
as well.

08:25.744 --> 08:29.552
You know, she just keeps on
giving and giving and giving
just to finish it.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.923
Jennifer is doing
a roast chicken breast

08:31.923 --> 08:34.227
‐ with a little Louisiana twist.
‐ Love it.

08:34.227 --> 08:36.900
Sam's attempting a meatloaf
across 60 minutes.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.068
Incredible.

08:38.068 --> 08:41.643
60 seconds remaining.

08:41.643 --> 08:44.247
Yeah. What?

08:44.247 --> 08:46.619
‐ Christina: Come on, guys.
‐ Come on guys, final minute.

08:46.619 --> 08:48.355
You got this,
you got this.

08:48.355 --> 08:53.165
Gordon:
You want to get your hands
on that huge advantage.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.606
‐ Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine, eight,

08:56.606 --> 08:59.779
seven, six, five,

08:59.779 --> 09:04.154
four, three, two, one.

09:04.154 --> 09:08.095
‐ Gordon: And stop. Well done.
‐ Christina: Hands in the air.

09:08.095 --> 09:11.401
Yeah! Nailed that!

09:11.401 --> 09:14.508
‐ Christina: All right.
‐ Well done.

09:14.508 --> 09:16.345
Now, tonight,
you were all given

09:16.345 --> 09:20.854
12 of the most popular items
on everyone's shopping list.

09:20.854 --> 09:24.127
As you know, we have
studied and tasted

09:24.127 --> 09:27.100
everything you've done
across the 60 minutes.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.672
Tonight, there were

09:29.672 --> 09:33.647
three dishes that stood out.

09:33.647 --> 09:36.318
‐ Sam,
‐ Good job, Sam.

09:36.318 --> 09:40.393
Heather and Mark.

09:40.393 --> 09:41.963
Head on up here,
let's go.

09:41.963 --> 09:44.300
I'm in a complete loss
for words.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.371
<i>I feel like Aladdin</i>
<i>on the carpet</i>

09:46.371 --> 09:48.342
<i>just floating</i>
<i>by my competitors.</i>

09:48.342 --> 09:49.712
I've got this.

09:49.712 --> 09:53.052
I'm gonna be getting
the advantage.

09:53.052 --> 09:55.423
Mark, Heather and Sam

09:55.423 --> 09:59.230
tonight,
you three stood out

09:59.230 --> 10:03.405
for all
the wrong reasons.

10:03.405 --> 10:07.748
All three of us
were hugely disappointed.

10:07.748 --> 10:11.622
Because all three
of your dishes were a mess.

10:22.611 --> 10:25.116
Mark, Heather and Sam.

10:25.116 --> 10:26.953
Tonight, you three

10:26.953 --> 10:29.925
stood out for

10:29.925 --> 10:34.100
all the wrong reasons.

10:34.100 --> 10:38.977
Because all three
of your dishes were a mess.

10:38.977 --> 10:41.114
Mark, Heather, Sam,

10:41.114 --> 10:44.755
you bottom three,
please head into
the wine room.

10:44.755 --> 10:47.528
This is pretty terrifying.

10:47.528 --> 10:50.466
I feel like I'm waiting
in the chairs outside
the principal's office.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.538
<i>My goose might be cooked.</i>
<i>It might be over already.</i>

10:52.538 --> 10:55.309
They might just come,
pull us out, chew us out,

10:55.309 --> 10:56.612
and send us home.

11:00.286 --> 11:03.492
All right, well now,
on to better news.

11:03.492 --> 11:05.797
Three home cooks
in particular

11:05.797 --> 11:08.302
really impressed us.

11:08.302 --> 11:12.578
The first dish
that really caught our eye,

11:12.578 --> 11:14.582
this dish had great
finesse around it.

11:14.582 --> 11:17.153
Showcasing those ingredients,
more importantly,

11:17.153 --> 11:18.756
MasterChef‐worthy.

11:18.756 --> 11:22.531
Please come down...

11:22.531 --> 11:23.766
Yachecia.

11:23.766 --> 11:24.969
( laughs )

11:24.969 --> 11:26.873
Yeah, mama.
You go, Yachecia.

11:26.873 --> 11:29.979
The first name called
is Yachecia!

11:29.979 --> 11:31.883
Yay! Hallelujah!

11:31.883 --> 11:33.553
Thank you, Jesus.

11:33.553 --> 11:35.456
<i>I spent my childhood</i>
<i>making biscuits with</i>
<i>my grandmother,</i>

11:35.456 --> 11:38.328
so I know I am making
Grammy proud.

11:38.328 --> 11:39.899
Right, describe
the dish, please.

11:39.899 --> 11:42.069
It is biscuits and gravy,

11:42.069 --> 11:44.207
with homemade chicken
and apple sausage,

11:44.207 --> 11:46.211
homemade buttermilk
pepper biscuit,

11:46.211 --> 11:48.215
crispy home fries underneath,

11:48.215 --> 11:50.085
and a soft scrambled
egg on top.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.756
So you do all that
and then three minutes to go

11:51.756 --> 11:53.993
decide to make
scrambled egg on the side.

11:53.993 --> 11:55.931
Is this what you're like
in general?

11:55.931 --> 11:58.703
Absolutely, because sometimes
I have to preach the sermons,

11:58.703 --> 12:00.573
sing the songs
and be the janitor.

12:00.573 --> 12:03.345
So we got to put it
all in there.

12:03.345 --> 12:04.848
Let's talk
about the biscuits.

12:04.848 --> 12:07.821
We couldn't believe how light
and exciting they were.

12:07.821 --> 12:09.725
Well, cold butter is my key.

12:09.725 --> 12:12.396
And then I didn't
have buttermilk,
so I had to make it.

12:12.396 --> 12:14.535
And added buttermilk to it.

12:14.535 --> 12:17.239
Really high temperature
for a short amount of time.

12:17.239 --> 12:20.513
‐ Wow, I mean, it's delicious.
‐ Thank you, sir.

12:20.513 --> 12:23.185
It tastes expensive,
yet it was made with
the staple ingredients.

12:23.185 --> 12:24.588
The biscuits are incredible.

12:24.588 --> 12:26.358
The potato underneath,
cooked beautifully,

12:26.358 --> 12:28.161
You know, but what
would I change?

12:28.161 --> 12:30.065
‐ Just a touch less cream
in the sausage.
‐ Okay.

12:30.065 --> 12:31.234
It's very rich.

12:31.234 --> 12:33.171
But the flavor's there.

12:33.171 --> 12:34.742
And if that's what you do
for breakfast,

12:34.742 --> 12:37.581
God knows what you do
for dinner.

12:37.581 --> 12:39.250
‐ Great job. Thank you.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.137
Hallelujah, right?

12:49.137 --> 12:51.074
Well, well, done.

12:51.074 --> 12:55.249
A lot of big flavor there
but none of those spices are
overpowering one another.

12:55.249 --> 12:58.422
I think your idea
of making buttermilk

12:58.422 --> 13:00.927
and enriching that dough
for the biscuits

13:00.927 --> 13:02.196
is really exceptional.

13:02.196 --> 13:04.902
If there's such a thing
tasting like 60 minutes,

13:04.902 --> 13:06.204
that's what it tastes like.

13:06.204 --> 13:09.912
‐ Excellent job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

13:09.912 --> 13:12.884
I mean, we didn't give you
chicken apple sausage.

13:12.884 --> 13:14.588
Talk me through
that sausage.

13:14.588 --> 13:15.723
I took the chicken breast

13:15.723 --> 13:18.095
and ground it up
with some spices,

13:18.095 --> 13:19.397
fresh dill, apples,

13:19.397 --> 13:21.735
and flavored it up
with a little bit
of cayenne,

13:21.735 --> 13:23.573
give it a little kick,
a little heat.

13:23.573 --> 13:25.075
That dish is delicious.

13:25.075 --> 13:27.379
The eggs add a great
light, fluffy richness

13:27.379 --> 13:30.319
to an otherwise rather dense
sausage gravy there.

13:30.319 --> 13:32.991
But you took the most basic
grocery store ingredients

13:32.991 --> 13:34.895
and you literally
churched them up.

13:34.895 --> 13:36.331
Yes.

13:36.331 --> 13:37.399
You knocked it out
of the park.

13:37.399 --> 13:41.241
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Nice job.

13:41.241 --> 13:43.345
Nice job, Yachecia.

13:43.345 --> 13:45.850
Thank you.
( exhales )

13:45.850 --> 13:49.190
The second dish
that we would like
to examine further

13:49.190 --> 13:52.998
is from a home cook
who really stayed true
to their home roots.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.968
This person made
Louisiana proud,

13:54.968 --> 13:57.173
come on down,
Jennifer.

13:57.173 --> 14:01.916
( cheering )

14:01.916 --> 14:04.888
Who would ever think
that a debt collector
from Louisiana would be

14:04.888 --> 14:08.061
part of the top three
of the first mystery box
challenge.

14:08.061 --> 14:09.965
Really?
( giggles )

14:09.965 --> 14:12.837
<i>I'm so excited,</i>
<i>it's just a dream</i>
<i>come true for me.</i>

14:12.837 --> 14:14.273
Aarón:
Jennifer, talk to me
about your dish.

14:14.273 --> 14:16.679
It's a blackened
chicken breast,

14:16.679 --> 14:19.150
with étouffée sauce,
runny egg

14:19.150 --> 14:20.520
with cinnamon potatoes.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.591
Where do you learn
to present food this way?

14:22.591 --> 14:25.997
Make carrot ribbons
and garnish with such
sophistication.

14:25.997 --> 14:28.101
Every day I come home
and my husband and I,

14:28.101 --> 14:31.274
I'll look at the refrigerator
and I'll try to make something
with what I have.

14:31.274 --> 14:34.648
So I feel like that this
is my art on a plate.

14:34.648 --> 14:37.119
I'm able to express myself
when I cook.

14:37.119 --> 14:40.893
That is truly a blackened
piece of chicken breast.

14:40.893 --> 14:43.331
All the specks
of the wonderful dried herbs

14:43.331 --> 14:46.237
and the spices kind of
just be part of that crust.

14:46.237 --> 14:48.475
Look at that chicken cook.
Like, that's perfect.

14:48.475 --> 14:49.811
‐ Oh, that looks good.
‐ It's cooked...

14:49.811 --> 14:51.548
‐ Yeah, that looks good.
‐ It does look good, right?

14:51.548 --> 14:55.890
‐ That's what's up.
‐ That's what's up, dude.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.226
Like they say in Louisiana,

14:57.226 --> 14:58.696
"That ain't
nothing nice, baby."

14:58.696 --> 15:01.301
All right? Yeah, you right.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.837
The sauce is rich.

15:02.837 --> 15:04.340
When it blends
with the yolk of the egg

15:04.340 --> 15:05.810
it's really
something special.

15:05.810 --> 15:08.683
The carrots, they have a little
bit of the acidic vinegar to it.

15:08.683 --> 15:10.185
Parsley, great choice of herb.

15:10.185 --> 15:12.524
Man, keep cooking like that

15:12.524 --> 15:15.028
‐ you're gonna go far.
‐ Thank you, I appreciate that
so much.

15:19.036 --> 15:20.372
‐ That chicken's
cooked beautifully.
‐ Thank you.

15:20.372 --> 15:22.176
‐ I appreciate that.
‐ Crisp, fragrant.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.848
All those wonderful herbs
that you want from down south.

15:24.848 --> 15:26.184
It's you on a plate.

15:26.184 --> 15:28.154
And it's so nice to see
that level of finesse

15:28.154 --> 15:30.693
so early on
in the competition
which we're not used to.

15:30.693 --> 15:32.564
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.735
Is this real?
Thank you.

15:34.735 --> 15:37.707
Good job, Jennifer.

15:40.713 --> 15:41.749
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you.

15:41.749 --> 15:44.621
The third dish
that we want to taste

15:44.621 --> 15:48.061
is from a home cook
who kept it simple

15:48.061 --> 15:50.566
but delicious.

15:50.566 --> 15:54.240
So good,
they named him twice.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.814
Brien O'Brien,
please step forward.

15:57.814 --> 15:59.083
Good job, Brien.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.655
This dish doesn't just represent
Northern California,

16:01.655 --> 16:03.191
it also represents my father,

16:03.191 --> 16:04.594
my Irish heritage,

16:04.594 --> 16:05.997
<i>everything that</i>
<i>I grew up with,</i>

16:05.997 --> 16:07.199
this is me on a plate.

16:07.199 --> 16:08.368
My father would be proud,

16:08.368 --> 16:10.205
and I know
I got a winning dish.

16:10.205 --> 16:12.544
All right, Brien O'Brien
what did you make?

16:12.544 --> 16:15.550
Well, today,
I made a fried chicken

16:15.550 --> 16:19.290
with a broccoli
and bacon slaw,

16:19.290 --> 16:21.695
and fried potatoes
I like to call "jo jos."

16:21.695 --> 16:23.465
What did you season
that chicken with?

16:23.465 --> 16:25.435
Um, the flour had
salt, pepper.

16:25.435 --> 16:27.874
There was some smoked paprika

16:27.874 --> 16:29.544
and some cayenne
for a little kick.

16:29.544 --> 16:30.713
What did you do
with the French fries‐‐

16:30.713 --> 16:32.884
‐ or the Jimmys, Johnnys.
‐ Jo jos.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.554
‐ Jo jos.
‐ ( laughs )

16:34.554 --> 16:36.658
I also gave those
a quick dredge

16:36.658 --> 16:37.927
just to give them
a a little crunch.

16:37.927 --> 16:38.996
Threw those in
the fryer as well

16:38.996 --> 16:40.666
and ended it
with a little salt.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.804
Talk to me about
that broccoli slaw.

16:42.804 --> 16:45.977
Started off with the bacon,
then I made my own aioli

16:45.977 --> 16:48.782
turned that into a dressing
with a little vinegar
and some sugar

16:48.782 --> 16:51.287
I threw some
Granny Smith apples in there

16:51.287 --> 16:53.993
and of course
the broccoli.

16:53.993 --> 16:57.266
I can't get over
the crispiness

16:57.266 --> 16:58.368
of that dredge.

16:58.368 --> 17:00.540
The way that you
perfectly have every bit

17:00.540 --> 17:01.975
of that chicken breast
covered.

17:01.975 --> 17:04.146
It's crunchy, it's crispy,
it's flavorful.

17:04.146 --> 17:06.317
I think that your french fries,
or your jo jos,

17:06.317 --> 17:08.421
are smart,
they're rustic.

17:08.421 --> 17:10.560
The acidity from
this broccoli slaw

17:10.560 --> 17:12.664
is a really smart
counterbalance.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.335
Would have loved for you
to slice those shallots down
a little bit more.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.505
Like show off
the knife work

17:16.505 --> 17:18.174
if you're going to keep it
somewhat simple.

17:18.174 --> 17:19.911
But all in all,

17:19.911 --> 17:21.682
it's a pretty
untouchable dish.

17:21.682 --> 17:23.519
‐ Nice job.
‐ Appreciate it.

17:30.198 --> 17:32.537
Chicken's delicious.
Got it evenly coated.

17:32.537 --> 17:34.173
Got it evenly colored
as well.

17:34.173 --> 17:36.143
You sort of clogged
my arteries up with
the fried chicken

17:36.143 --> 17:38.348
and then opened my veins up
with the slaw.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.452
I love what you've done
with that rustic charm.

17:40.452 --> 17:41.788
It needs a bit of color.

17:41.788 --> 17:43.826
'Cause you've got
that fried chicken, fries,

17:43.826 --> 17:46.030
it's all the same
sort of coat of paint.

17:46.030 --> 17:49.036
But you delivered something
that has got great flavor.

17:49.036 --> 17:51.040
And you've shown
great skill.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.545
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you.

17:53.545 --> 17:55.549
Good job, Brien.

17:55.549 --> 17:57.820
‐ Bring it in, buddy.
‐ Thanks guys.

18:03.331 --> 18:06.638
Three outstanding dishes,
let's get that right.

18:06.638 --> 18:09.009
But tonight,
there can only be
one winner

18:09.009 --> 18:13.284
of this first
mystery box challenge.

18:13.284 --> 18:14.954
The dish of the night...

18:17.960 --> 18:19.396
Congratulations...

18:30.920 --> 18:33.024
The dish of the night

18:33.024 --> 18:35.361
was cooked by...

18:35.361 --> 18:36.698
Congratulations...

18:39.537 --> 18:41.675
Brien O'Brien.
Well done.

18:41.675 --> 18:43.044
Nice job, B. O. B.

18:43.044 --> 18:45.415
Winning the first
mystery box solidified

18:45.415 --> 18:47.887
my number one ranking
in this competition.

18:47.887 --> 18:49.356
Nice job, Brien.

18:49.356 --> 18:51.628
Those other competitors can
throw a target on my back

18:51.628 --> 18:52.930
'cause all I gotta say is,

18:52.930 --> 18:55.401
"winner, winner,
chicken dinner."

18:55.401 --> 18:57.707
Uh, Brien, you're now safe
from elimination.

18:57.707 --> 18:59.409
‐ Great start.
‐ Thank you.

18:59.409 --> 19:00.980
All three of your
dishes tonight

19:00.980 --> 19:03.484
displayed some
serious skills.

19:03.484 --> 19:06.758
We're not ready to risk
losing any of you three yet.

19:06.758 --> 19:09.931
All three of you are safe
from elimination.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.335
‐ ( all cheering )
‐ Yes! Woo!

19:12.335 --> 19:14.406
‐ Come here, guys.
‐ ( giggling )

19:14.406 --> 19:16.177
Oh ( bleep ).

19:16.177 --> 19:17.613
Oh, thank you, Lord.

19:17.613 --> 19:19.684
Actually, tonight,
for the first time ever,

19:19.684 --> 19:23.357
there was so much talent
across all of those dishes

19:23.357 --> 19:25.361
that all of you are safe.

19:25.361 --> 19:27.132
( all cheering )

19:27.132 --> 19:31.541
That's right,
the entire kitchen,
minus the wine cellar,

19:31.541 --> 19:35.415
are safe from elimination.

19:35.415 --> 19:36.483
That's not good for us.

19:36.483 --> 19:39.489
All 17 of you,
head on up to the balcony,

19:39.489 --> 19:42.395
‐ let's go.
‐ Yes!

19:42.395 --> 19:44.934
I was on cloud nine
just a few days ago.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.138
when I found out
I got that white apron.

19:47.138 --> 19:48.742
Oh, no.

19:50.846 --> 19:53.184
I've worked
really hard to be here.

19:53.184 --> 19:55.288
And it all might be
taken away right now.

19:55.288 --> 19:58.194
It's a pretty rough
feeling down here.

19:58.194 --> 20:00.365
All right, right now,
it's time to learn the fate

20:00.365 --> 20:02.503
of our bottom three
home cooks.

20:02.503 --> 20:04.006
Please come on out.

20:04.006 --> 20:06.010
Let's go.

20:16.063 --> 20:18.000
Okay. Mark, Heather, Sam.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.508
Each of these dishes
are way off.

20:21.508 --> 20:23.044
60 minutes to come up
with something

20:23.044 --> 20:24.212
with ingredients
that you know

20:24.212 --> 20:25.883
on a daily basis.

20:25.883 --> 20:27.385
Right now we're concerned.

20:27.385 --> 20:30.391
These do not
show us potential,

20:30.391 --> 20:32.395
skill, technique.

20:32.395 --> 20:33.832
You can't be happy
with them, can you?

20:33.832 --> 20:35.536
No.

20:35.536 --> 20:37.405
( sighs ) Mark...

20:37.405 --> 20:38.909
let's talk.

20:38.909 --> 20:41.447
The pancake, it just,
it has problems.

20:41.447 --> 20:43.050
It's undercooked.

20:43.050 --> 20:46.524
Seeing raw apple and raw banana
just stuck on the plate

20:46.524 --> 20:48.562
is like the finesse
isn't there.

20:48.562 --> 20:51.133
The hash brown,
it almost looks like
a piece of meat.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.703
I know what you can do.

20:52.703 --> 20:54.974
I watched you make
the most beautiful,
delicious ravioli

20:54.974 --> 20:56.711
that won you that apron.

20:56.711 --> 21:00.051
And it feels like
a completely different
home cook made this dish.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.255
I feel like it was
the fourth quarter
with two minutes left

21:02.255 --> 21:04.192
and I ran out on the field
without my helmet

21:04.192 --> 21:06.865
or my jockstrap.

21:06.865 --> 21:10.004
And I left both
my proteins my table.

21:10.004 --> 21:13.745
It's underwhelming
and disappointing
to say the least.

21:13.745 --> 21:17.018
Heather, I'm just,
I'm baffled.

21:17.018 --> 21:18.588
Describe to me
what happened here.

21:18.588 --> 21:20.859
Um, I tried to work
with all the flavors

21:20.859 --> 21:23.632
that my mother
cooked with from Peru,

21:23.632 --> 21:26.270
with a lot of the herbs
and a lot of the spices.

21:26.270 --> 21:28.374
It didn't turn out
the way that I wanted.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.710
I just think, for me,

21:29.710 --> 21:31.581
it came down
to the fundamentals.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.252
You cooked it meat side down,
instead of skin side down.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.589
It's dry as a bone.

21:35.589 --> 21:38.260
You have no sauce.
You didn't peel the carrots.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.732
So they're completely
muddy and dirty.

21:40.732 --> 21:43.070
You know, you mentioned your mom
and you mentioned Peru,

21:43.070 --> 21:45.174
and when you say that
with such conviction,

21:45.174 --> 21:47.011
then you serve me that,

21:47.011 --> 21:49.116
it's a complete travesty

21:49.116 --> 21:50.586
to all the great
Peruvian cooks

21:50.586 --> 21:52.422
that I call friends
and colleagues.

21:55.696 --> 21:58.668
‐ Sam, you look pissed.
‐ I don't like the way
my dish looks.

21:58.668 --> 22:01.641
That doesn't look anywhere
near like a meatloaf.

22:01.641 --> 22:04.045
Just bland, horrible.

22:04.045 --> 22:06.316
But the one issue
I have with you is,

22:06.316 --> 22:07.418
you need to pay attention.

22:07.418 --> 22:09.790
A meatloaf needs time
to cook, right?

22:09.790 --> 22:11.761
That's an insipid burger.

22:11.761 --> 22:13.397
But above all that,

22:13.397 --> 22:15.736
that sauce was disgusting.

22:15.736 --> 22:18.274
You're blowtorching
a can of tomatoes.

22:18.274 --> 22:19.610
Young man, you gotta stop
getting carried away

22:19.610 --> 22:21.246
with all of the frills.

22:21.246 --> 22:22.583
I don't give a rat's ass

22:22.583 --> 22:24.754
about the chicken skin
on top of the mashed potatoes.

22:24.754 --> 22:26.624
‐ What was the hero tonight?
‐ It was supposed to be
the meatloaf.

22:26.624 --> 22:28.027
Well, it wasn't.

22:28.027 --> 22:30.498
And you gotta start
taking this seriously.
Got me?

22:30.498 --> 22:33.137
Yes, chef.

22:33.137 --> 22:35.976
Uh, all three of you
are now staring elimination
in the face,

22:35.976 --> 22:38.280
and all three of you
need to prove

22:38.280 --> 22:40.786
that you are good enough
to stay in this competition,

22:40.786 --> 22:42.523
because these three dishes
have no place

22:42.523 --> 22:44.226
in the MasterChef kitchen.

22:44.226 --> 22:47.398
Now, if you were given
the chance to start
this challenge over,

22:47.398 --> 22:48.969
you think you could
do it better?

22:48.969 --> 22:51.006
‐ Yes.
‐ Without a doubt.

23:06.103 --> 23:07.539
Gordon:
Do those bags look familiar?

23:07.539 --> 23:08.975
‐ Yes, they do.
‐ Yes, Chef.

23:08.975 --> 23:11.046
All three of you,
pick up your bag

23:11.046 --> 23:13.217
and head back
to your station.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.386
Let's go.

23:14.386 --> 23:15.722
Yes.

23:15.722 --> 23:17.960
You got it.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.229
Oh, boy. Here we go.

23:19.229 --> 23:22.168
<i>All of a sudden</i>
<i>the adrenaline starts pumping,</i>

23:22.168 --> 23:24.205
and it's like
I'm back in high school

23:24.205 --> 23:26.577
getting ready to, like,
hit the wrestling mat,

23:26.577 --> 23:28.915
<i>and I'm ready to wrestle</i>
<i>for my redemption.</i>

23:28.915 --> 23:31.721
Let's see what's inside
those grocery bags, guys.

23:39.269 --> 23:40.706
Gordon:
That's right.

23:40.706 --> 23:44.346
You have the exact same
ingredients as you did earlier,

23:44.346 --> 23:49.189
as well as a fresh
staple pantry box.

23:49.189 --> 23:52.228
We're giving you a chance
for culinary redemption.

23:52.228 --> 23:54.099
Christina:
Elimination is on the line,

23:54.099 --> 23:55.736
and you need to prove
you listened

23:55.736 --> 23:57.405
and that you can act
on the feedback

23:57.405 --> 23:59.209
that we just gave you.

23:59.209 --> 24:01.279
It can be an entirely
new dish

24:01.279 --> 24:04.018
or a much,
much better version

24:04.018 --> 24:06.858
of the dish that
landed you in this mess
in the first place.

24:06.858 --> 24:09.597
Because you've already
had one attempt at this,

24:09.597 --> 24:11.934
we're gonna ramp
things up a little.

24:11.934 --> 24:14.005
Last time, you had one hour.

24:14.005 --> 24:18.046
This time you'll only
have 45 minutes.

24:18.046 --> 24:22.221
Let us down again
and you will be going home.

24:22.221 --> 24:26.229
That could mean one of you,
two of you,

24:26.229 --> 24:28.434
or all of you.

24:30.471 --> 24:32.108
‐ Wow.
‐ Wow.

24:37.619 --> 24:40.592
In front of you, you have
the exact same ingredients

24:40.592 --> 24:43.598
as you did during tonight's
mystery box challenge.

24:43.598 --> 24:47.739
Let us down and you
will be going home.

24:47.739 --> 24:51.179
That could mean
one of you, two of you,

24:51.179 --> 24:54.854
or all of you.

24:54.854 --> 24:56.824
‐ Wow.
‐ Wow.

24:58.193 --> 24:59.195
Ready?

24:59.195 --> 25:00.364
‐ I'm ready.
‐ Ready.

25:00.364 --> 25:01.667
Born ready.

25:01.667 --> 25:06.309
Your 45 minutes starts...

25:06.309 --> 25:08.413
now.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.986
‐ All right, guys.
‐ Come on.

25:10.986 --> 25:13.323
( sighs )

25:13.323 --> 25:16.263
Guys, this is
a "MasterChef" first.

25:16.263 --> 25:17.799
We've never given
home cooks

25:17.799 --> 25:20.070
the same ingredients
to work with again.

25:20.070 --> 25:21.974
Whether they make
the same dish

25:21.974 --> 25:23.176
or whether they make
a brand new dish,

25:23.176 --> 25:25.447
what we're
really testing here

25:25.447 --> 25:26.951
is can they learn
from their mistakes?

25:29.590 --> 25:31.293
This is so nerve‐racking.

25:31.293 --> 25:32.596
‐ Way to go.
‐ Yeah, keep it up.

25:32.596 --> 25:33.865
Keep it up.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.267
Being a nurse, I do well
under pressure.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.806
I'm showing the judges
that I'm a fighter,

25:37.806 --> 25:41.346
I don't give up easy,
and that I really wanna win
this competition.

25:41.346 --> 25:42.849
If I were Heather,

25:42.849 --> 25:44.787
maybe come back and attack
that chicken breast
in a different way.

25:44.787 --> 25:46.624
The other element
of Heather's dish

25:46.624 --> 25:48.226
that was lacking
was a sauce,

25:48.226 --> 25:49.730
something to kind of
bring it all together.

25:49.730 --> 25:51.366
I would try
to really show us

25:51.366 --> 25:52.803
that I took complete notice

25:52.803 --> 25:53.972
of what your comments
had to bear.

25:53.972 --> 25:58.246
Where is it,
getting more‐‐ ugh!

25:58.246 --> 25:59.917
Come on, Mark.
Pick it up.

25:59.917 --> 26:02.756
Um, I've been in this position
in my life before.

26:02.756 --> 26:06.664
Pressure is my...
middle name.

26:06.664 --> 26:09.536
Mark's dish was just such
a poor showing of 60 minutes.

26:09.536 --> 26:11.674
A flabby pancake?

26:11.674 --> 26:13.310
This is an elimination
challenge.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.780
If you aren't
pushing yourself,

26:14.780 --> 26:15.849
I'm not interested
in having you

26:15.849 --> 26:16.951
in this kitchen any longer.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.723
Aarón: Agreed.

26:19.723 --> 26:23.230
This is where I prove that
I learn from my mistakes.

26:23.230 --> 26:25.401
That's what separates
good students from bad students.

26:25.401 --> 26:28.173
I'm a creative writing
teacher from Washington, DC,

26:28.173 --> 26:30.578
and that's what I ask from
my students in the classroom,

26:30.578 --> 26:31.914
and that's what I need
to give today.

26:31.914 --> 26:33.316
Sam, big letdown for me.

26:33.316 --> 26:35.689
I mean, anyone
that starts a meatloaf

26:35.689 --> 26:36.857
with 20 minutes to go,

26:36.857 --> 26:38.761
having cooked the potatoes
and the garnish, crazy.

26:38.761 --> 26:40.899
If I was Sam, I would not
be going back to meatloaf.

26:40.899 --> 26:44.606
If he his, then it needs
to be in the oven now.

26:44.606 --> 26:48.447
Christina: All right, guys.
Nearly 30 minutes to go.

26:48.447 --> 26:50.785
Keep hustling.

26:50.785 --> 26:52.121
( exhales )
Right.

26:52.121 --> 26:53.891
Sam,
tell me about the dish.

26:53.891 --> 26:55.427
Um, I'm making the same dish,

26:55.427 --> 26:57.599
but I'm trying
to solve the problems
that you asked me to do.

26:57.599 --> 27:01.272
‐ Meatloaf in the oven?
‐ Uh, not yet.

27:01.272 --> 27:02.709
So you've started
the sauce again.

27:02.709 --> 27:05.047
‐ Well, that's the glaze.
‐ But stop.

27:05.047 --> 27:06.216
What takes
the longest to cook?

27:06.216 --> 27:09.188
Uh, the meatloaf,
but the meatloaf and the glaze

27:09.188 --> 27:10.992
go in at the same time, no?

27:10.992 --> 27:13.330
But get the meatloaf in
and glaze it as it cooks

27:13.330 --> 27:15.902
so you kill two birds
with one stone.

27:15.902 --> 27:16.904
Yes, chef.

27:16.904 --> 27:18.741
Are you okay?

27:18.741 --> 27:19.777
I'm doing the best
I can.

27:19.777 --> 27:21.112
Then move your ass.

27:21.112 --> 27:23.049
I'm working, Chef.
I'm working.

27:27.191 --> 27:28.460
‐ Heather.
‐ Yes?

27:28.460 --> 27:30.297
Here you are for redemption.
Talk to me about your dish.

27:30.297 --> 27:32.602
I'm making a chicken kabob

27:32.602 --> 27:33.805
with a little vinaigrette

27:33.805 --> 27:35.875
with broccoli slaw
and carrot slaw,

27:35.875 --> 27:38.981
and I'm gonna grill the chicken
on little wooden skewers,

27:38.981 --> 27:40.384
but I'm brining it first.

27:40.384 --> 27:42.388
Okay, this is all or nothing
for you, Heather.

27:42.388 --> 27:44.458
Absolutely.
I will not let you
down, sir.

27:48.266 --> 27:49.770
He moving in slo‐mo.

27:49.770 --> 27:51.072
He is moving slow‐mo.

27:51.072 --> 27:53.109
‐ All right, Mark.
‐ Hello, Christina.

27:53.109 --> 27:54.345
So what are you making?

27:54.345 --> 27:56.984
Because I didn't execute
the pancake properly,

27:56.984 --> 27:58.353
basically totally boned it,

27:58.353 --> 28:00.992
I'm gonna go back
to the 28 sweep and nail that,

28:00.992 --> 28:03.898
execute the pancake,
put chocolate chips
in it instead,

28:03.898 --> 28:06.236
and I'm gonna do baked eggs
in the oven this time.

28:06.236 --> 28:08.574
If you don't execute
the basic play first,

28:08.574 --> 28:09.877
then why try to do
the flea flicker?

28:09.877 --> 28:12.281
What's with all these
football analogies?

28:12.281 --> 28:14.252
Uh, I was an athlete
back in the day,

28:14.252 --> 28:16.422
and that's how I deal
with this.

28:16.422 --> 28:18.126
All right.
Keep your eye on the clock.
You got this.

28:18.126 --> 28:20.230
All right, thanks,
Christina.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.301
What in the hell
is he doing?

28:24.305 --> 28:25.575
Why would you do that?

28:25.575 --> 28:28.246
15 minutes remaining.
Come on.

28:28.246 --> 28:29.750
( claps )

28:29.750 --> 28:31.754
‐ Get it, girlfriend.
‐ Thanks, guys.

28:31.754 --> 28:34.927
Right. So Sam's gone
for the meatloaf again.

28:34.927 --> 28:37.464
First thing he started
was the glaze.

28:37.464 --> 28:39.770
I've got no idea how
he's gonna pull this off.

28:39.770 --> 28:41.039
( clattering )

28:41.039 --> 28:42.107
Ooh.

28:42.107 --> 28:43.611
I'm looking at Heather,

28:43.611 --> 28:45.213
and, you know, if Heather
really nails that chicken

28:45.213 --> 28:46.449
by brining it

28:46.449 --> 28:48.386
and that chimichurri
really has a chance
to bloom,

28:48.386 --> 28:50.625
I think she has a chance
to kind of get over that hump.

28:50.625 --> 28:53.129
Mark is also
remaking his dish.

28:53.129 --> 28:55.233
He's making chocolate‐chip
pancake instead

28:55.233 --> 28:58.741
of the pancake that he made
earlier with the caramel sauce.

28:58.741 --> 29:00.545
I don't know
if you guys feel this way,

29:00.545 --> 29:02.816
but for me, it looks like
Mark doesn't care.

29:02.816 --> 29:05.822
I might wanna
switch up here...

29:05.822 --> 29:07.191
I'm not saying
he's checked out,

29:07.191 --> 29:08.828
but I don't look at him
and think that,

29:08.828 --> 29:10.430
"Wow, this guy's desperate."

29:10.430 --> 29:12.101
Oh, this is so hard to watch.

29:12.101 --> 29:13.370
It is. Really, it is.

29:13.370 --> 29:16.042
Just over
ten minutes remaining.

29:16.042 --> 29:18.380
Starting to smell good
in here.

29:18.380 --> 29:19.850
Right, Heather,
how are we doing?

29:19.850 --> 29:21.019
Doing all right, sir.

29:21.019 --> 29:23.724
We brine chicken
to impart flavor,

29:23.724 --> 29:25.561
and it normally takes
sort of 24 hours

29:25.561 --> 29:26.864
to brine a chicken.

29:26.864 --> 29:28.400
Why would you attempt
to do it in 45 minutes?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.137
Because I wanna try
to get it nice and moist.

29:30.137 --> 29:32.474
You're grilling it now
with no fat on there.

29:32.474 --> 29:34.145
It's gonna get even drier.

29:34.145 --> 29:36.750
Brush the chimichurri
onto the chicken

29:36.750 --> 29:37.852
as you're cooking it,

29:37.852 --> 29:40.057
therefore it stays
a little bit moist.

29:40.057 --> 29:41.593
‐ Okay, will do.
‐ Yeah?

29:41.593 --> 29:44.031
You still got
eight minutes to go,
and you can bring this back.

29:44.031 --> 29:46.603
I'm trying. I'm trying.

29:46.603 --> 29:47.906
You know what
you can do, Heather?

29:47.906 --> 29:50.377
Just do what I do
and ignore them.

29:50.377 --> 29:52.214
( gasps )

29:52.214 --> 29:55.555
Somehow I don't think
that's the best strategy,
Mark.

29:55.555 --> 29:58.259
‐ Young man, is this
a joke for you?
‐ No.

29:58.259 --> 30:00.263
‐ Is this just a big show off
for your mates?
‐ No.

30:00.263 --> 30:01.567
No, well, take it serious,
or take your apron off.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.735
I am taking it seriously.

30:02.735 --> 30:04.873
Take it serious
or take your apron off.

30:06.442 --> 30:07.444
What is going on here?

30:07.444 --> 30:09.983
What is Mark doing?

30:16.295 --> 30:19.135
Brush the chimichurri
onto the chicken

30:19.135 --> 30:20.337
as you're cooking it.

30:20.337 --> 30:22.942
Will do. I'm trying.

30:22.942 --> 30:24.513
You know what you can do,
Heather?

30:24.513 --> 30:26.683
Just do what I do
and ignore them.

30:26.683 --> 30:28.521
( gasps )

30:28.521 --> 30:31.359
Somehow I don't think
that's the best strategy,
Mark.

30:31.359 --> 30:33.631
‐ Young man,
is this a joke for you?
‐ No.

30:33.631 --> 30:35.500
‐ Is this just a big show off
for your mates?
‐ No.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.803
No, well, take it serious,
or take your apron off.

30:36.803 --> 30:37.939
I am taking it seriously.

30:37.939 --> 30:41.547
Take it serious
or take your apron off.

30:41.547 --> 30:42.882
What is going on here?

30:42.882 --> 30:44.151
What is Mark doing?

30:44.151 --> 30:47.124
This is embarrassing.

30:47.124 --> 30:48.627
Eboni:
<i>Are you serious?</i>

30:48.627 --> 30:51.533
Mark does not care about
this competition whatsoever.

30:51.533 --> 30:55.073
<i>Mark thinks the world</i>
<i>stops for him.</i>

30:55.073 --> 30:57.979
Not today, baby.
Hmm‐mm.

30:57.979 --> 30:59.415
Two minutes to go.

30:59.415 --> 31:02.655
All of you, you need
to have your dish completed

31:02.655 --> 31:05.595
down on the front,
under the two minutes.

31:05.595 --> 31:06.763
Those fries look good.

31:06.763 --> 31:09.501
Gordon:
75 seconds to go.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.040
‐ Let's go, let's go.
‐ Strong finish.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.877
Gordon: Wow,
Mark's down already.

31:13.877 --> 31:15.615
Now he doesn't have
anything to do.

31:15.615 --> 31:17.484
Mark, you still
got one minute.

31:17.484 --> 31:21.292
‐ Mark.
‐ I'm‐‐ I'm working on it.

31:21.292 --> 31:24.465
Christina:
Come on, guys.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.503
‐ Raw banana.
‐ Oh, God, don't do
the raw banana.

31:26.503 --> 31:28.406
20 seconds remaining.

31:28.406 --> 31:30.978
‐ Christina: Steady hand, Sam.
‐ Come on, Sam.

31:30.978 --> 31:32.982
Come on, now.

31:32.982 --> 31:35.053
Aarón:
Come on, Heather, let's go.
Finishing touches.

31:35.053 --> 31:39.696
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

31:39.696 --> 31:42.935
five, four, three,

31:42.935 --> 31:44.371
two, one, and stop.

31:44.371 --> 31:48.279
‐ Well done.
‐ All right!

31:48.279 --> 31:51.953
Sam and Heather are phenomenal,
top‐notch chefs,

31:51.953 --> 31:53.624
<i>but I'm here to compete.</i>

31:53.624 --> 31:55.293
<i>I'm here to win this,</i>
<i>and I wanna prove</i>

31:55.293 --> 31:57.297
I have every right
to be here.

31:57.297 --> 31:59.268
Let's start with Sam.

31:59.268 --> 32:02.341
So earlier you cooked
a meatloaf.

32:02.341 --> 32:05.213
You got a mashed potato
topped with crispy skin

32:05.213 --> 32:06.583
and then
there was carrot slice.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.520
‐ Yes.
‐ Um, describe
the dish, please.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.194
Um, meatloaf,
mashed potatoes, and carrots.

32:12.194 --> 32:15.433
The meatloaf has ground bacon,
smoked paprika,

32:15.433 --> 32:16.937
and homemade ketchup.

32:16.937 --> 32:19.509
Mashed potatoes have corn,
bacon grease,

32:19.509 --> 32:21.045
and some cheddar cheese
in it,

32:21.045 --> 32:24.084
and then carrots with sugar,
apple cider vinegar,

32:24.084 --> 32:25.721
then I finished it
with some dill.

32:25.721 --> 32:28.359
Visually, it's not
the prettiest meatloaf.

32:28.359 --> 32:29.763
I was running out of time,

32:29.763 --> 32:32.635
and I figured having it
on the plate a little messy

32:32.635 --> 32:34.773
was better than not having it
on the plate at all.

32:34.773 --> 32:36.576
A meatloaf in 45 minutes

32:36.576 --> 32:39.749
is virtually impossible
to get it done correctly.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.485
Did you not think about just
completely changing the dish?

32:41.485 --> 32:43.089
You know,
like I ask of my students,

32:43.089 --> 32:44.091
I wanna learn
from what I did.

32:44.091 --> 32:45.493
If I made something new,

32:45.493 --> 32:47.164
I might make a whole bunch
of brand new mistakes.

32:47.164 --> 32:48.332
Okay, let's taste it.

32:48.332 --> 32:50.805
You try some of the meatloaf
off before you...

32:50.805 --> 32:51.907
Yes, I did.

32:51.907 --> 32:53.176
I thought it needed
a little more salt,

32:53.176 --> 32:54.344
and I thought it needed
a little more pepper.

32:54.344 --> 32:56.015
Um, so here's the thing.

32:56.015 --> 32:59.923
A, does it taste better
than the meatloaf earlier?

32:59.923 --> 33:01.325
Yes.

33:01.325 --> 33:03.362
B, the sides,
does that taste better?

33:03.362 --> 33:04.465
Yes.

33:04.465 --> 33:06.903
I think with you
it's about prioritizing.

33:06.903 --> 33:08.907
Teach yourself
a little bit of discipline

33:08.907 --> 33:10.143
by pacing yourself.

33:10.143 --> 33:12.982
‐ It needs some work, right?
‐ Yes, chef.

33:12.982 --> 33:16.422
Thank you.

33:16.422 --> 33:17.925
All right, Sam,

33:17.925 --> 33:20.731
so think about
teaching creative writing,

33:20.731 --> 33:23.336
you think about the formation
of a story, right?

33:23.336 --> 33:24.606
Yeah.

33:24.606 --> 33:26.776
How do you think about
composing that first dish,

33:26.776 --> 33:28.614
and how did you think about
composing this dish?

33:28.614 --> 33:30.651
Um, with the first dish,

33:30.651 --> 33:33.289
I think I had, like,
middle, beginning, end

33:33.289 --> 33:34.859
all mixed together,

33:34.859 --> 33:36.863
so I knew that,
if nothing else,

33:36.863 --> 33:39.602
I wanted to get my beginning,
my middle, and my end in there.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.840
I think there might still be
one or two spelling mistakes,

33:41.840 --> 33:43.544
but I'm hoping that I, like,

33:43.544 --> 33:45.446
went up
at least one grade here.

33:45.446 --> 33:48.854
So visually it doesn't look
like a MasterChef‐worthy

33:48.854 --> 33:51.158
piece of meatloaf,
but it tastes delicious.

33:51.158 --> 33:52.562
You hit all the points.

33:52.562 --> 33:54.498
That ground bacon in there
is smart.

33:54.498 --> 33:57.003
The mashed potatoes
are a drastic improvement.

33:57.003 --> 33:58.807
I don't know about
the dill and the carrots

33:58.807 --> 34:01.011
with the other flavors
you brought in.

34:01.011 --> 34:02.480
It's definitely
a better‐written story.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.086
Is it good enough to keep you
in this kitchen?

34:05.086 --> 34:08.259
‐ We'll have to see.
‐ Thank you.

34:08.259 --> 34:09.862
All right.

34:09.862 --> 34:12.500
Heather,
remind me what was that
first dish you made for us?

34:12.500 --> 34:15.941
I initially made
a pan‐seared chicken breast

34:15.941 --> 34:16.943
with chimichurri.

34:16.943 --> 34:18.112
How did you change it?

34:18.112 --> 34:20.450
Talk to me a little bit
about the dish.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.955
I made a chimichurri
chicken kabob

34:22.955 --> 34:25.293
with some cilantro,
a vinaigrette,

34:25.293 --> 34:27.698
and I made french fries
to go with the kabob.

34:27.698 --> 34:30.036
This, for me, looks more
like that Peru

34:30.036 --> 34:32.407
that you were talking about,
the anticuchos.

34:32.407 --> 34:34.579
and automatically it looks
like it's a lot moister.

34:34.579 --> 34:38.720
You can see
some of that juice
kinda running off.

34:38.720 --> 34:42.595
Look. Night and day.

34:42.595 --> 34:44.565
‐ This is delicious.
‐ Thank you.

34:44.565 --> 34:45.734
There's a great
amount of crunch.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.437
The vinaigrette
is very well‐balanced.

34:47.437 --> 34:49.174
Your chimichurri,
great flavor.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.445
Next time you do it,
don't throw your herbs
in there.

34:51.445 --> 34:53.950
Chop your herbs
so you have bigger chunks

34:53.950 --> 34:55.353
and more of the perfume
of the herbs.

34:55.353 --> 34:56.355
Okay.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.627
But well done. Thank you.

34:58.627 --> 35:01.365
Thank you.

35:01.365 --> 35:02.902
All right, Heather.

35:02.902 --> 35:05.541
Now you took some risks
by choosing to take
a chicken breast

35:05.541 --> 35:06.976
and turn it into a kabob.

35:06.976 --> 35:08.547
Most people leave it whole
for a reason.

35:08.547 --> 35:10.684
It's lean, it doesn't
have a lot of fat,

35:10.684 --> 35:11.920
and the kabob
is sort of like,

35:11.920 --> 35:13.189
you know,
it's a cheaper way

35:13.189 --> 35:15.226
to eat an off‐cut
of the chicken,

35:15.226 --> 35:17.363
so why choose
to skewer it?

35:17.363 --> 35:19.167
Having it on the kabob
with the sauce on the side

35:19.167 --> 35:21.573
just seemed like an easier
thing for you to eat.

35:21.573 --> 35:24.211
There's heat, there's flavor.

35:24.211 --> 35:27.685
Visually, the dish
is far more appealing.

35:27.685 --> 35:30.691
Flavor of the chicken
is definitely an improvement.

35:30.691 --> 35:33.362
Is it enough to keep you
in this competition?

35:33.362 --> 35:37.103
‐ We'll have to see.
‐ Thank you.

35:38.907 --> 35:40.443
Mark.

35:40.443 --> 35:42.480
Big question, do you feel
you've done better

35:42.480 --> 35:44.317
than you did earlier?

35:44.317 --> 35:48.225
Yes, in all aspects of it.

35:48.225 --> 35:50.998
Right.
Describe the dish please.

35:50.998 --> 35:53.435
I've got
a chocolate‐chip pancake

35:53.435 --> 35:55.273
dusted with powdered sugar.

35:55.273 --> 35:58.680
I've got baked eggs
with heavy cream
on the bottom,

35:58.680 --> 36:00.349
bacon, cheddar cheese,

36:00.349 --> 36:01.619
parsley, and cilantro.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.389
The combination
of the chocolate pancake

36:03.389 --> 36:05.861
with the coddled eggs
with the bacon,

36:05.861 --> 36:06.896
how does that work?

36:06.896 --> 36:08.967
I've got sweet and savory,

36:08.967 --> 36:11.539
so I've got
salt from the bacon.

36:11.539 --> 36:15.581
I've got the salt
that I added to the baked egg.

36:15.581 --> 36:19.054
It blends.

36:20.056 --> 36:22.093
That is tough
to look at.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.001
No.

36:26.001 --> 36:29.642
Mark, are you just going
through the motions?

36:29.642 --> 36:31.846
Is this the best breakfast
you've ever cooked?

36:31.846 --> 36:33.950
Yes.

36:33.950 --> 36:36.255
I successfully completed
the 28 sweep,

36:36.255 --> 36:39.929
and I think
I scored a touchdown.

36:39.929 --> 36:42.100
Oh, no.

36:48.980 --> 36:52.353
Mark...

36:52.353 --> 36:54.291
That is tough to look at.

36:54.291 --> 36:55.827
( inhales )

36:55.827 --> 36:57.965
Are you just going
through the motions?

36:57.965 --> 37:00.469
Is this the best breakfast
you've ever cooked?

37:00.469 --> 37:04.177
Yes. I successfully
completed the 28 sweep,

37:04.177 --> 37:08.018
and I think
I scored a touchdown.

37:08.018 --> 37:10.289
What a douche.

37:10.289 --> 37:12.493
Oh, no.

37:12.493 --> 37:16.301
Here's the thing, Mark.

37:16.301 --> 37:18.005
You know‐‐
tastes quite nice.

37:18.005 --> 37:19.542
They're cooked beautifully.

37:19.542 --> 37:23.048
But my big question
is did you maximize
those 45 minutes?

37:23.048 --> 37:24.217
Yes.

37:24.217 --> 37:25.954
But with 90 seconds left,

37:25.954 --> 37:27.858
you just waltzed up,
put your plate down.

37:27.858 --> 37:32.000
So are you hungry enough
to become America's
next MasterChef?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.335
I'm starving.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.471
( laughs )

37:39.882 --> 37:42.755
All right, Mark, how long
did you bake these eggs?

37:42.755 --> 37:44.224
Uh, 15 minutes.

37:44.224 --> 37:46.061
And then that bacon
you put in uncooked.

37:46.061 --> 37:47.263
Correct.

37:47.263 --> 37:48.933
Why not sear the bacon
off beforehand?

37:48.933 --> 37:51.038
The amount of time
that it's in there for

37:51.038 --> 37:52.106
with the heavy cream,

37:52.106 --> 37:53.610
it should cook the meat
fully through

37:53.610 --> 37:55.446
in that period of time.

37:55.446 --> 37:57.250
The pancake
is cooked properly,

37:57.250 --> 37:59.755
which was a big point
of contention previously.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.926
You got rid
of the poorly‐made
caramel sauce.

38:01.926 --> 38:03.362
You got rid
of the hash browns.

38:03.362 --> 38:04.698
It's really just a matter

38:04.698 --> 38:07.136
of whether a chocolate‐chip
pancake and baked eggs

38:07.136 --> 38:10.209
is worthy
of this competition.

38:16.221 --> 38:17.925
Gordon:
Mark, Heather, Sam,

38:17.925 --> 38:20.864
all three of you,
please come 'round
to the front

38:20.864 --> 38:24.705
and give us
a moment to discuss
those in more detail.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.021
So, listen, I mean,
there was a vast improvement.

38:33.021 --> 38:34.290
You have Mark, you have Sam,

38:34.290 --> 38:36.863
both chose to kinda
go in a similar route

38:36.863 --> 38:38.566
and make improvements
to their dish.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.136
‐ Gordon: Very smart.
‐ Christina: All right, Sam.

38:40.136 --> 38:42.741
It looked mediocre,
but it was better.

38:42.741 --> 38:44.110
He just needs
more confidence.

38:44.110 --> 38:47.551
Now, Mark, I just can't
help but look and say,

38:47.551 --> 38:49.320
"This dish for 45 minutes?"

38:49.320 --> 38:50.657
Gordon: Heather,
I'm slightly nervous about.

38:50.657 --> 38:52.426
You don't put a breast
on a kabob,

38:52.426 --> 38:54.264
however the chicken
did taste better.

38:54.264 --> 38:55.767
‐ Aarón: Yes.
‐ Chimichurri was delicious.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.938
We can send one home,
we can send two home,

38:57.938 --> 39:00.442
or we can send
all three home.

39:07.256 --> 39:09.895
Christina:
Now you all won
those white aprons

39:09.895 --> 39:11.364
and a place
in this competition,

39:11.364 --> 39:14.137
but not everyone can stay
in this kitchen forever.

39:14.137 --> 39:18.478
We're looking for one
American MasterChef.

39:19.782 --> 39:21.552
Gordon: Tonight,
Mark, Heather, and Sam,

39:21.552 --> 39:24.758
we wanted to see an improvement
across those dishes.

39:24.758 --> 39:28.065
Some of you stuck to your guns,
some of you changed your ways.

39:32.173 --> 39:33.475
So who's going home tonight?

39:36.782 --> 39:39.087
Gordon: Sam.

39:42.661 --> 39:43.696
And Heather.

39:43.696 --> 39:45.634
Make your way
to the balcony.

39:45.634 --> 39:49.173
( cheers and applause )

39:49.173 --> 39:51.011
Off you go.

39:51.011 --> 39:53.315
You showed us enough.

39:53.315 --> 39:55.052
‐ Good job, guys.
‐ Yes, good job.

39:55.052 --> 39:56.121
Congratulations.

39:56.121 --> 39:57.691
What a relief.

39:57.691 --> 39:59.528
I've been waiting to walk
up those balcony stairs

39:59.528 --> 40:02.199
<i>for what feels like</i>
<i>about seven semesters.</i>

40:02.199 --> 40:04.237
<i>I'm gonna continue</i>
<i>to improve,</i>

40:04.237 --> 40:06.842
<i>and my next dish is gonna be</i>
<i>better than my last one.</i>

40:06.842 --> 40:08.178
I've just gotten started.

40:08.178 --> 40:10.850
I've got a lot of great food
left to show everybody.

40:10.850 --> 40:14.858
Mark, tonight's second attempt
of your American breakfast

40:14.858 --> 40:16.762
wasn't good enough.

40:16.762 --> 40:19.735
We felt that you hadn't
utilized the time properly.

40:19.735 --> 40:22.273
We didn't feel that hunger.

40:22.273 --> 40:23.943
And, more importantly,

40:23.943 --> 40:27.450
I personally don't think
you are quite ready

40:27.450 --> 40:29.521
to become America's
next MasterChef.

40:29.521 --> 40:31.057
Thank you,
all three of you.

40:31.057 --> 40:32.627
I appreciate
the time and energy

40:32.627 --> 40:34.230
and the investment
that you put in me,

40:34.230 --> 40:37.103
and I'm sorry that the return
wasn't there for you both.

40:37.103 --> 40:41.612
Mark, please take your apron
to your station and go home.

40:41.612 --> 40:42.981
Good night.

40:42.981 --> 40:45.452
‐ Good luck, Mark.
‐ Good luck, Mark.

40:45.452 --> 40:48.659
Mark:
<i>As a competitor, it totally</i>
<i>sucks that I'm leaving,</i>

40:48.659 --> 40:50.597
but I'm not leaving
something behind.

40:50.597 --> 40:55.072
<i>This has given me a whole new</i>
<i>love and passion for cooking,</i>

40:55.072 --> 40:58.579
and I get to share it
with my wife and my kids

40:58.579 --> 41:01.919
and my loved ones,
and that means a lot to me.

41:04.858 --> 41:06.428
<i>I'm so proud of myself</i>
<i>right now</i>

41:06.428 --> 41:09.066
<i>that if I had two arms</i>
<i>attached to my back,</i>

41:09.066 --> 41:10.570
I'd be patting myself
on the back.

41:10.570 --> 41:12.473
I mean,
I'd be hugging myself.

41:12.473 --> 41:14.711
<i>And that's truth.</i>
<i>Straight up.</i>

41:19.822 --> 41:20.890
Announcer:
<i>Next week...</i>

41:20.890 --> 41:22.426
Whoo‐hoo!

41:22.426 --> 41:24.096
I think that may
be David Hasselhoff.

41:24.096 --> 41:26.769
<i>The competition</i>
<i>kicks into high gear...</i>

41:26.769 --> 41:28.973
Gordon:
<i>Our lifeguards are arriving.</i>

41:28.973 --> 41:30.008
Whoo!

41:30.008 --> 41:31.010
<i>And it's sink or swim...</i>

41:31.010 --> 41:32.146
Don't fall apart now.

41:32.146 --> 41:33.783
<i>As the top 19...</i>

41:33.783 --> 41:35.252
Gordon: Let's go.
Red team, blue team.

41:35.252 --> 41:37.356
<i>...face their first</i>
<i>team challenge of the season.</i>

41:37.356 --> 41:38.458
Beautiful.

41:38.458 --> 41:40.496
‐ <i>Who will save the day?</i>
‐ Yay!

41:40.496 --> 41:41.699
We got the best fish
over here!

41:41.699 --> 41:43.870
<i>And who will be</i>
<i>lost at sea?</i>

41:43.870 --> 41:45.707
Gordon:
What have they done?
It's not even cooked.

41:45.707 --> 41:47.343
You might as well
take your aprons off

41:47.343 --> 41:48.478
and go home now.

41:48.478 --> 41:50.449
Congratulations,
blue team.
