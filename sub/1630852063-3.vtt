WEBVTT

00:31.320 --> 00:33.360
Hello, welcome to Top Gear.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.240
It's a very exciting show tonight,
as we're doing something

00:37.240 --> 00:38.680
we haven't done in a while.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.120
It's time to dust off
the old suitcase and work out

00:41.120 --> 00:45.240
what colour passport we need
because we're off abroad.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.800
CHEERING

00:47.800 --> 00:51.000
See, a while back, we got talking
about the noble tradition

00:51.000 --> 00:53.320
of the great British expedition.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.840
Scott of the Antarctic,
Ranulph Fiennes,

00:55.840 --> 00:58.080
cruising with Jane MacDonald.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.040
Proper pioneering British stuff.

01:01.040 --> 01:04.280
And it got us wondering on a budget
of a few thousand quid,

01:04.280 --> 01:07.800
which would be the best British cars
to take on an expedition.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.200
So we each went out and bought one.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.960
However, the world being
how it was back in July,

01:12.960 --> 01:14.840
there wasn't many options on offer,

01:14.840 --> 01:17.760
but we did find one place -
a land not far from home -

01:17.760 --> 01:21.440
with all the terrain you need
to test an expedition vehicle.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.520
So we packed our bags
and shipped our cars...

01:24.520 --> 01:25.960
..to Iceland.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.600
Whoohoo.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.280
Wild, rugged,

01:39.280 --> 01:41.800
and breathtaking to behold,

01:41.800 --> 01:45.680
this isolated mound
of volcanic rock

01:45.680 --> 01:48.640
in the middle
of the North Atlantic Ocean

01:48.640 --> 01:51.360
packs more landscape
onto its shores

01:51.360 --> 01:54.400
than countries ten times its size.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.120
To test the mettle of a budget
British expedition vehicle,

02:00.120 --> 02:04.480
Iceland is the ultimate
proving ground.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.520
Look at the colours!

02:06.520 --> 02:08.000
Greens.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.680
Have you ever seen
a glacier that big?

02:09.680 --> 02:12.120
I've not, no. I've eaten a few.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.480
To be honest, I can't believe
Flintoff's not here.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.040
He would love this.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.680
Unfortunately, the day before
we travelled,

02:20.680 --> 02:23.320
Flintoff had been forced
to self-isolate,

02:23.320 --> 02:25.200
so couldn't join the trip.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.080
Oh, I spy shipping containers.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.040
But while Fred hadn't made it,
his wheels had.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.880
Do you know this is the thing.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.400
How have they got there?
Who's brought them in?

02:46.840 --> 02:50.800
Now, obviously, these are sealed up.
Yeah.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.440
It's a bit like looking
in someone's mail list.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.880
But I think it's what
he would have wanted.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.680
Shall we open his up?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.720
I'll open.
You say what lies within.

02:59.720 --> 03:04.080
Yes. Ah, of course.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.640
He's gone classic.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.880
Oh!

03:08.880 --> 03:10.960
It's a manual!

03:12.040 --> 03:14.200
I've never driven
a manual Range Rover before.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.640
A diesel manual.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.360
Classic. Classic.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.160
Wow. Get over here.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.000
He was always going
to go with that, weren't he?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.480
It's a diesel to start with.
That's very rare.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.240
These are very desirable,
and it's a Manuel.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.520
Well, look at the wand on that!

03:29.520 --> 03:30.920
This is a lovely car.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.840
I mean, it's the choice.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.280
When most people go,
"Well, it's an expedition.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.680
"It's off road. I'm going to go one
of these." But it's a bit obvious.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.480
I know it is a bit obvious,
but it's good.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.000
It's a great solution.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.200
Tell you what, Pad, it's got
the velour upholstery as well.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.640
I'm jealous.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.440
If he's not here to drive that,

03:47.440 --> 03:49.560
and I prefer that to mine,
can I have that?

03:49.560 --> 03:51.320
Well, I'm already bored with this

03:51.320 --> 03:53.120
because it's just
the obvious choice.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.360
And you're learning prepositions -
"bored with."

03:55.360 --> 03:58.000
Before you met me, you'd have said
"bored of."  Prepositions.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.560
That's...  You see, you're learning.
I've learned another word there.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.400
You're not mangling
our language any more.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.120
Ha-ha-ha!

04:06.440 --> 04:08.560
There it is. Oh!

04:08.560 --> 04:10.760
I'm so pleased about this.

04:21.280 --> 04:26.360
The Vauxhall Chevette.  Yes.  Look
at it, Paddy.  I used to have one.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.640
Did you?
Not the rally version.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.160
Wide arches.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.840
White mini lights.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.200
Massive!
Look at those fog lights.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.280
Doesn't say expedition!

04:36.280 --> 04:38.360
Why not?  Well, it's a rally car.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.880
It's got knobbly tyres.
It'll get me anywhere.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.040
It will get you anywhere.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.280
But I suspect in this,
give it an hour,

04:45.280 --> 04:47.120
you won't be happy.  Why not?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.440
Look at the terrain
we're going to be going over!

04:49.440 --> 04:51.120
You're going to be so uncomfortable
in that.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.480
Look at the lights!

04:52.480 --> 04:54.240
It's got spotlights.
It's got nice lights.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.200
Yeah. It's fantastic.
And it says...Lombard RAC Rally.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.200
Let's have a look inside.
Come on.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.520
I used to love mine back in the day,
but my mine was comfortable.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.120
Oh, Paddy, this is...

05:06.120 --> 05:08.080
This might be the best car
I've had on this show

05:08.080 --> 05:09.440
and I normally have the best cars.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.680
What?!

05:10.680 --> 05:12.760
Look at the wheel arches!

05:12.760 --> 05:14.560
Look at the wheel arches.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.120
Hang on, I've got to get out
for this. Did you just say...

05:17.120 --> 05:19.200
Because I need to just clarify this.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.880
..the Vauxhall Chevette is the best
car you've had on this show.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.200
You know you've said something
wrong, there, don't you?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.680
Look at it!
Do you want to retract that remark?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.400
It's brilliant.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.720
What I'm going to do now
is introduce you

05:32.720 --> 05:34.800
to a little bit of class.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.440
Have we got a guest presenter?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.160
Oh, oh, dear.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.920
Hey.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.960
Oh, he has.  Come on. Hey.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.000
Here we go.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.640
It starts.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.760
Ooh.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.240
Have I nailed it
or have I nailed it?

06:08.240 --> 06:10.080
One of my least favourite things

06:10.080 --> 06:12.200
is admitting when you've done
something right.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.520
I enjoy these moments.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.720
And how good does it look
on off road tyres?

06:15.720 --> 06:18.440
Fantastic! It's just...

06:18.440 --> 06:20.400
This. The Silver Shadow for me...

06:20.400 --> 06:23.360
is just... It's everything.
It's class. It's opulence.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.320
It's just special, innit?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.120
How can you
saying the word, "opulent"

06:27.120 --> 06:30.640
make opulent sound not opulent?
Opulent.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.240
It just doesn't sound opulent
when you say it.  Why not?

06:33.240 --> 06:34.880
Sounds like an ointment
you put on a toe.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.040
This car was built on adventure.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.320
First World War British Army

06:42.320 --> 06:45.040
used these in Egypt and Jordan
all over the place.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.480
Not Shadows, they didn't.

06:46.480 --> 06:50.280
Lawrence of Arabia owned
eight of them.  Not Shadows.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.240
Look, you're living off a heritage
this doesn't live up to.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.720
This is a 1970s machine.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.840
These weren't adventure cars, these
were for weddings and pop stars.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.560
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.440
Just hold on one moment there.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.600
Now I knew you'd come at me
with the wedding thing.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.520
Yeah.  And I'm going
to give you a little factoid now

07:06.520 --> 07:09.360
because this is something the great
Chris Harris will not know.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.160
Now come down the front here.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.080
The Spirit of Ecstasy.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.320
Take two fingers.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.800
Where are you going with this?
Take two fingers.

07:18.800 --> 07:24.200
Now, take those fingers and just
stroke them on her frontage.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.720
What am I... Is this a wind up?

07:26.720 --> 07:29.560
No, just give it
a little - a little caress.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.960
Now...

07:30.960 --> 07:35.560
..if they are smooth,
it's been used as a wedding car

07:35.560 --> 07:40.200
because the ribbon wears them down.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.600
If they're pert, not a wedding car.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.200
What are you feeling?

07:45.200 --> 07:47.120
Wrong.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.120
They're pert. They are.
Not a wedding car.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.360
They're in great shape.  And do you
know what else as well, Christopher?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.600
Have a look in the back.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.360
No back seats.
I've had them taken out.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.960
Expedition...a little bit lighter.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.480
Basically, what you're looking
at here...  Yeah.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.600
..is the Rolls-Royce
of expedition vehicles.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.720
Oh, God!

08:07.720 --> 08:08.960
That's what you're looking at.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.920
Only you and I could have come
on an expedition

08:10.920 --> 08:12.760
and leave behind the one
that's going to be any good.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.480
Exactly.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.720
Shall we get in?  Yes.  Come on.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.280
Here we go.

08:19.280 --> 08:24.880
So our Flintoff-less
two car adventure was under way.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.600
Oh, lovely.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.880
Expedition time.

08:29.880 --> 08:34.280
First up, we've been told to explore
the island's wild coastline.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.040
And if the whole point
of our mission was to discover

08:39.040 --> 08:42.760
strange new worlds,
then it's fair to say Iceland

08:42.760 --> 08:45.840
was getting straight down
to business.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.560
Look at that landscape!

08:47.560 --> 08:52.640
This is just flat, black,
volcanic rock and sand

08:52.640 --> 08:53.920
all the way out to the sea.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.840
This place is unlike
anywhere else on the planet.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.840
Look at the greens on the right,
Chris.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.400
We're following in the footsteps

09:01.400 --> 09:04.480
of great British adventurers
here, aren't we?

09:04.480 --> 09:09.080
Unfortunately, for Harris, though,
the whole point of our mission

09:09.080 --> 09:11.840
was actually to see
how our cars coped

09:11.840 --> 09:14.000
with Iceland's rugged landscape.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.360
And the early news
from the Chevette...

09:18.360 --> 09:21.120
Oof.
..was as predicted.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.360
Ooh.  Oh, oh, oh.

09:23.360 --> 09:27.360
Urgh. What have I done here?

09:27.360 --> 09:30.880
Are you feeling every single divot
in that car?

09:30.880 --> 09:35.360
Oh, come on, then. Tell me
just how comfortable it is in there.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.600
It is heavenly in here.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.320
Just because you're going
on an adventure doesn't have to mean

09:46.320 --> 09:48.200
you're going to be uncomfortable.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.480
Oh, I'm too hot in here
and I'm feeling quite sick already.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.360
I mean, looking at Chris's car,
he's not very comfortable.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.200
He's got the door open
for a kick off

09:58.200 --> 10:00.840
because he's getting gassed out
by the petrol.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.600
Why be like that?
Why be like Chris Harris?

10:06.960 --> 10:09.960
You want to travel in a bit
of style, a bit of class.

10:09.960 --> 10:14.240
This car is fantastic, and it's got
all the mod cons on it as well.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.960
I mean, granted these days
they're not mod cons,

10:16.960 --> 10:20.640
they're more old cons but, back
in the day, were cutting edge.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.400
It's even got
a Philips tape deck on it.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.840
Oh.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.280
Everything OK, Christopher?

10:30.720 --> 10:32.600
It's very fumy.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.040
This could be
a psychedelic experience

10:35.040 --> 10:38.360
once I've had a few more
of these fumes.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.240
Right. Here we go.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.560
Always a good sign
letting the fumes out.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.240
Just sorting my wardrobe, Pad,
nothing to worry about.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.320
You just sit tight.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.040
Now, then, the Vauxhall Chevette,

10:57.040 --> 11:02.160
not just the UK's
best-selling hatchback 1975 to '78.

11:02.160 --> 11:07.520
No, this Chevette
is even more special

11:07.520 --> 11:10.920
because apart from being noisy
and fumy and hot,

11:10.920 --> 11:13.600
in becoming a rally car,
it's been given

11:13.600 --> 11:15.600
a 2-litre twin carb engine

11:15.600 --> 11:20.080
and the gearbox is from racing
specialists Quake.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.160
This car's gear shift.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.640
Oh, it reminds me of every single
supercar that's got paddles

11:27.640 --> 11:29.120
as been completely wrong.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.960
This is joyous. Snick, snick, snick.

11:31.960 --> 11:36.480
Straight cut gears one to three,
fourth... If we go to fourth.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.440
That's second, that's fourth.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.440
Fourth is quiet.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.000
I need to get into fourth gear
for a bit of peace and quiet.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.480
And when it comes
to peace and quiet...

11:49.680 --> 11:53.800
..that is something
Iceland does very well.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.160
Oh, this is a lovely little road.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.920
Look at this!

12:13.920 --> 12:17.040
Ooh. It smelt gorgeous then.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.360
Now, with the fumes in your car,
Chris, you won't be able

12:21.360 --> 12:25.960
to appreciate this,
but these flowers smell beautiful.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.320
OK.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.040
OK.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.760
Aha! That's unpleasant.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.880
So let's talk about power,
Christopher.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.240
What's the Vauxhall croquette
packing?

12:37.240 --> 12:40.080
100 horsepower,
courtesy of a Ford Pinto.

12:40.080 --> 12:44.160
The Silver Shadow's got
a 6.75 litre V8,

12:44.160 --> 12:48.520
and it's packing
a massive 200 horsepower, Chris.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.880
There's no way
that's got 200 horses.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.960
I reckon at least a third of them

12:53.960 --> 12:56.080
have been packed off
to the glue factory.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.680
Well, we'd soon see

12:59.680 --> 13:03.360
because a few more miles
down the old dusty trail,

13:03.360 --> 13:05.200
we were soon to discover

13:05.200 --> 13:10.640
that when Iceland isn't doing
peace and quiet...it's doing this.

13:17.600 --> 13:23.080
Yes, this favourite local pastime
is sand drag racing.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.960
And since this is how Iceland's
petrolheads decide whose wheels

13:27.960 --> 13:31.200
are fastest over the black stuff...

13:31.200 --> 13:33.240
Look at some of this!

13:33.240 --> 13:36.520
To see whether our intrepid
explorers were anything

13:36.520 --> 13:38.520
like fit-for-purpose,

13:38.520 --> 13:42.640
we've been told to go
and get stuck in ourselves.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.440
Ah! That's right.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.720
They're having a look around.
Royalty's here.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.920
The Silver Shadow.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.360
And a little blue thing.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.360
Getting out of this
with any dignity isn't easy.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.120
Oh.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.760
Why do we always turn up
to these things underequipped?

14:04.240 --> 14:07.600
Look at that!
That's interesting.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.240
A T-shirt over the jumper.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.160
Right, let's have a look round.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.240
So it's what...90 metres drag strip?

14:18.240 --> 14:20.320
Yeah. Oh, all happening.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.520
What's that all about?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.000
Why would you want to do that?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.480
I wouldn't, so let's
forget about that. Drag racing.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.080
Yeah.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.280
Oh!

14:35.680 --> 14:37.880
They've named this after you.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.560
Well, nearly.
What's the brake horsepower?

14:42.720 --> 14:45.640
A thousand.  A thousand.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.320
A thousand.  On sand.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.800
Would you sit in that?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.000
No!

14:51.000 --> 14:54.800
Essentially what you're
sitting in, there is a rocket.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.080
How much power does this have?

14:58.320 --> 15:01.360
1,200.  1,200.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.120
1,200.  How much power is that?

15:05.120 --> 15:08.640
Can easily be 2,000.  2,000.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.440
Is this one of the fastest cars
on the island?  Yeah.  It is.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.800
Yeah.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.720
Did you just ask if the 2,000 brake
horsepower drag...drag racer

15:16.720 --> 15:18.400
is one of the fastest cars on the
island...

15:18.400 --> 15:19.920
What do you expect the answer to be?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.120
There's probably...
There's a faster Corolla over there.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.640
There must be a nut job
that's got 4,000.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.280
You know what they're like
round here! Right.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.760
Wow.  I want to watch
one of these go.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.680
Can you get in it and show us how
fast it goes?  Yeah.  Yes.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.440
Oh, come on, then.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.000
Here they go.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.520
That is absolutely ridiculous.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.960
And with the second biggest result
of the day

15:54.960 --> 15:58.560
going to our new friend,
Icelandic Batman,

15:58.560 --> 16:01.400
it was time for the main event.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.680
Chris, I've got to say,
after watching those drag races,

16:06.680 --> 16:08.320
these people here,
I think they're going to be

16:08.320 --> 16:09.960
a little bit underwhelmed.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.560
What! After a 2,000 horsepower
nitrous dragster,

16:12.560 --> 16:14.040
why would they be disappointed

16:14.040 --> 16:16.200
watching a Silver Shadow
bury itself?

16:18.160 --> 16:20.840
But, just to add to the spectacle,

16:20.840 --> 16:25.280
the producers had decided
to make this drag a three-way.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.040
What's that doing here?

16:31.680 --> 16:34.080
And what's he doing driving it?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.960
He must have been double jabbed.

16:39.120 --> 16:44.840
And that meant, with a special treat
lined up for the winner,

16:44.840 --> 16:49.840
the first ever budget British
expedition vehicle foot race

16:49.840 --> 16:51.880
was on.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.640
We're away.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.280
Oh, my God.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.560
Can I get a bit more traction?

17:03.240 --> 17:05.280
Stig's going well.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.520
Now, we've got some power.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.520
Now the Chevette comes into its own.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.400
34, 36.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.200
I've got him.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.160
# Get it on, bang a gong

17:17.160 --> 17:19.080
# Get it on. #

17:19.080 --> 17:21.080
I'm nowhere near him.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.760
The victor's the little Corvette.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.280
That was ridiculous.
That was the slowest race ever.

17:36.760 --> 17:41.120
Well, congratulations, we all knew
what the outcome were going to be,

17:41.120 --> 17:43.560
but it was nice to see you
go over the finish line.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.760
As ever, when someone wins,
they've got to get on the podium

17:46.760 --> 17:48.400
and reap the rewards.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.440
What rewards?

17:52.160 --> 17:53.360
Why do they always dress me?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.400
I always end up looking
like a complete idiot.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.560
You'll be all right.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.480
Ignore that - that frayed bit.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.960
There's a massive knot
in that one, look.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.360
OK, guys, here we go.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.680
Is this it? Are we doing it?
Are we doing it?

18:05.680 --> 18:07.600
All right.
Paddy, get over that way.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.920
We're doing it. Go on, Chris.

18:09.920 --> 18:14.160
Oh, BLEEP this
for a game of soldiers.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.280
Ready?  Yes.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.080
Go on, Chris. Oh, Jesus!

18:19.080 --> 18:23.040
Agh!  I can't run. My leg's off.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.640
Oh, Paddy!

18:25.640 --> 18:28.040
Go on, Chris.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.960
There she goes.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.160
Agh! Blimey.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.520
McGuinness!

18:37.520 --> 18:39.920
How high up are we now?

18:39.920 --> 18:42.720
Now I think it's around 300 metres.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.840
Wow, OK.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.040
Now what's happening?
Is the rope OK?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.640
Pad, he's taken the rope away.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.080
What do I do?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.040
Enjoy it.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.880
We're really high up.
Really, really high up.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.920
It wasn't all bad news
for Harris, though.

19:01.920 --> 19:06.800
The view up here
is absolutely outrageous.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.640
Because once he'd finally touched
down, and we were on our way again,

19:11.640 --> 19:14.440
at least he could get back
to enjoying

19:14.440 --> 19:18.520
the luxurious comfort
of his Vauxhall.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.120
How is the briquette?

19:22.120 --> 19:25.040
This car makes so many noises.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.680
Every single stone
that goes up inside the wheel arch

19:27.680 --> 19:29.520
makes a massive bang.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.640
The engine makes
a huge amount of noise.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.520
The tyres make a noise,
but above all of it

19:34.520 --> 19:36.600
is the whine
from the straight cut gears.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.000
It takes over everything.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.600
Just...can you ask, why have
you got the straight cut gears?

19:42.600 --> 19:46.960
Because they give me much faster,
more satisfying gearshifts.

19:46.960 --> 19:51.280
We're driving. We're pottering
around Iceland for God's sake.

19:54.800 --> 19:59.480
And when it comes to pottering
around Iceland, one of our cars

19:59.480 --> 20:02.720
really was in a class of its own.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.280
I know I've said it before,
I'm going to keep saying it.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.760
This car was proper cutting edge.
Back in the day,

20:09.760 --> 20:12.840
the Silver Shadow was one of
the most advanced cars

20:12.840 --> 20:14.160
in the world.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.160
It had magic hydraulic suspension,
and everything was electric.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.120
It showed the world
what we were capable of.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.160
Little things like this...
Now, THIS is an absolute treat.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.320
Look at this. When you put the radio
on, watch the aerial.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.560
HE CHUCKLES: Look at that!

20:31.560 --> 20:33.440
Isn't that amazing?

20:34.440 --> 20:37.640
Aw, I miss things like that. The old
aerial pops up.

20:37.640 --> 20:41.160
When you turn the radio off,
down it goes.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.600
Look at that.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.200
Oh, God.

20:47.080 --> 20:51.120
RADIO: Hold on a second. Slight
technical. Won't be a moment.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.320
Aerial issues.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.480
Here we go.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.280
I've got a hole where my radio was.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.680
I've got two wires. And you're
worried about your electric aerial?

21:04.320 --> 21:05.360
That's the one.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.400
Just to be clear, if a slightly
sticky aerial is the only thing

21:12.400 --> 21:15.520
you can complain about on
your expedition,

21:15.520 --> 21:18.200
that, my friends, is called winning.

21:19.760 --> 21:24.920
And over in the Courgette, it had
been the straw that finally

21:24.920 --> 21:26.440
broke Harris.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.120
# Oh, the straight-cut gears
are lovely

21:29.120 --> 21:31.360
# Oh, the straight-cut gears are
lovely

21:31.360 --> 21:34.320
# No, they're not
They're really horrible

21:34.320 --> 21:36.120
# Wah!

21:37.200 --> 21:40.000
# Wah-wah! #

21:40.000 --> 21:41.840
I'll come straight out with it, Pad.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.720
This car is ridiculous.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.440
PADDY CHUCKLES

21:45.440 --> 21:47.600
Could we stop so I can phone Fred

21:47.600 --> 21:50.080
and maybe rent his Range Rover
off him?

21:53.440 --> 21:55.400
Sadly, though, we couldn't.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.600
Because it was time for the next
stage of our expedition testing

22:00.600 --> 22:01.720
to begin.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.720
And since successful expeditions
aren't only about the fitness

22:06.720 --> 22:08.600
of the vehicles,

22:08.600 --> 22:12.000
before heading back into the wild,
we'd been told

22:12.000 --> 22:17.040
we'd be trying out another of
Iceland's favourite pastimes.

22:17.040 --> 22:21.800
This one designed to see
if we were also

22:21.800 --> 22:22.960
match fit.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.840
Yes, the Strong Man contest.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.520
Us two up against some very
large locals,

22:33.520 --> 22:39.200
led by the world's tenth strongest
man, Eythor Ingolfsson Melsted.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.840
Here we go.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.360
How do you do a hard walk?

22:43.360 --> 22:44.520
Do that with your arms.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.960
How are you?  Hey, guys.  How are you?

22:49.080 --> 22:50.680
Can I ask a couple of questions?

22:50.680 --> 22:52.440
How much do you weigh?

22:52.440 --> 22:54.360
I'm around 145 kilos.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.880
How much can you lift,
sort of weight?

22:57.880 --> 23:00.280
I deadlift 300, to 70kg.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.800
3...  Whoa, that's a lot.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.760
Now, we're going to do some
warm-up.  What, here?

23:04.760 --> 23:06.520
Yeah.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.720
Now, somewhere in the middle
of this frankly hateful exercise...

23:10.720 --> 23:12.000
Come on, let's go!

23:12.000 --> 23:13.760
We are going!

23:13.760 --> 23:15.400
..it was revealed that McGuinness

23:15.400 --> 23:19.320
and I would be competing together
over three rounds

23:19.320 --> 23:21.480
with a vehicular theme.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.080
Oh, God.  20 push ups.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.080
Come on.  Oh, God.  All the way down.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.720
Come on!  I'm going!

23:29.880 --> 23:34.520
And that meant we'd be kicking off
with the tyre flip,

23:34.520 --> 23:37.840
where our strongman opponent
would be the fresh-faced

23:37.840 --> 23:40.160
Kristjan Jon Haraldsson.

23:41.960 --> 23:46.080
All right, guys!
In three, two, one...

23:46.080 --> 23:47.400
BEEP!

23:48.640 --> 23:50.360
Come on, McGuinness.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.480
GRUNTING

23:52.480 --> 23:53.640
McGuinness, come on!

23:55.400 --> 23:58.040
One more, Chris!  Ready?  Yeah!

23:59.600 --> 24:02.200
YELLING

24:06.240 --> 24:08.920
I think Flintoff
would have been proud of that.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.280
A surprise early win for Britain.

24:12.280 --> 24:16.120
And next up was the car walk.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.080
But with Kristjan back for
revenge,

24:19.080 --> 24:23.320
this one did need a bit
more practise.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.080
Three, two, one, go!

24:27.080 --> 24:28.560
So, we're going on the "go"?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.120
Yeah.  Right.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.640
You ready?  I just lifted it!

24:34.200 --> 24:35.240
Go!

24:36.720 --> 24:39.560
Kristjan, I don't know if you've
ever seen Top Gear,

24:39.560 --> 24:41.880
but it's probably better just
putting an engine in it

24:41.880 --> 24:42.920
and driving it, son.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.720
Lost on him. Let's just do it.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.520
All right, guys, are you ready?

24:50.520 --> 24:53.320
No!  Three, two, one!

24:57.920 --> 24:59.520
Are you ready?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.080
GRUNTING
Oh, BLEEP!

25:02.640 --> 25:04.240
Paddy, stop it! Paddy!

25:04.240 --> 25:05.600
BEEP!

25:07.800 --> 25:09.280
Come on, Pad!

25:10.440 --> 25:11.600
Yes!

25:13.040 --> 25:15.600
I can't quite get up there.
Thank you.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.480
1-1, then.

25:19.480 --> 25:23.840
And for the decider, Eythor
himself will be stepping up

25:23.840 --> 25:26.960
for the fearsome truck pull.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.160
Or to make it even vaguely
a contest,

25:30.160 --> 25:34.720
the truck versus two much
lighter cars...

25:34.720 --> 25:36.480
..pull.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.760
Hey, we're up against the big
lad now!

25:38.760 --> 25:42.200
This is for Team GB.  Tenth strongest
man in the world

25:42.200 --> 25:46.000
versus the tenth funniest
man in the world.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.320
And the smallest man in the world.
Shut up!  Right.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.600
OK, guys, are you ready?

25:51.600 --> 25:53.560
Three, two, one.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.120
WHISTLE BLOWS

25:55.120 --> 25:56.240
Get down!

25:57.240 --> 26:00.640
Go, go, go. We've got it.
We've got it.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.080
Come on!
Keep going, Chris.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.560
Suddenly, Harris's stripped-out,
lightweight Chevette wasn't looking

26:07.560 --> 26:10.320
like such a bad choice after all.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.640
Keep it going. Little steps.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.600
Look at me feet.
Come on, son.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.080
Keep going.  I can't do much more.
Keep going!

26:18.080 --> 26:21.680
And with the big, heavy
lorry digging its heels in,

26:21.680 --> 26:26.960
it turned out the soft Icelandic
turf was also on our side.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.920
WHISTLE BLOWS

26:31.320 --> 26:33.920
PANTING

26:33.920 --> 26:35.040
Are we done here?

26:37.560 --> 26:38.760
Eythor!

26:40.160 --> 26:43.520
Oh! Every respect, sir.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.880
Oh! That... How you guys
do that,

26:47.880 --> 26:49.640
I'll never know.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.360
Oh, thank you so...

26:51.360 --> 26:54.760
But I think the main thing is...
The real winners were us.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.520
He's right. It is us.
Well done!  Yes!

26:58.720 --> 27:01.000
Right! A protein shake.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.280
See you on the other side.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.640
Ooh, I'm seeing colours.

27:08.720 --> 27:12.600
Now, having proven we could also
handle anything Iceland

27:12.600 --> 27:14.320
could throw at us...

27:14.320 --> 27:18.400
..ish, the time had come to point
our two-car convoy

27:18.400 --> 27:22.360
towards the island's wilder,
more remote, interior.

27:24.520 --> 27:29.840
From here on out, tarmac roads would
be a distant memory.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.000
Whoa!

27:31.000 --> 27:34.160
The expedition testing was back
in full swing...

27:35.280 --> 27:37.040
..with our next obstacle being...

27:38.360 --> 27:39.400
..water.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.800
RADIO: How's the little Chevette?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.840
All right, this is a bit
more serious.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.680
This is not good.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.800
Fear not, my little friend.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.640
This is where the Rolls-Royce
comes into its own.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.040
Here we go.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.880
Stay close, Croquette.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.280
It might get moist.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.960
Here we go. Straight in. Come on!

28:09.960 --> 28:12.200
Come on, Silver Lady!

28:12.200 --> 28:15.480
Oh! Not a problem!

28:15.480 --> 28:17.720
A lot of smoke coming out of
the bonnet, though.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.320
How's he getting on?

28:24.480 --> 28:25.800
Go on, son.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.360
She's stuck.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.920
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.600
Come on, little Chevette!

28:50.600 --> 28:53.080
Yes!
RADIO: Is that the little Croquette?

28:53.080 --> 28:54.520
No turning back now!

29:01.000 --> 29:03.600
LAUGHING

29:13.640 --> 29:15.320
Never in doubt, Patrick.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.360
Whoa!

29:20.160 --> 29:21.960
Oh!

29:21.960 --> 29:23.320
Now we're expeditioning.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.240
Look at that up in front of us
there, Chris.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.640
Oh, now, that over there,

29:33.640 --> 29:36.920
would you say - is that a volcano,
Christopher?

29:36.920 --> 29:39.840
That is the most active volcano
on the island.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.680
That is Hekla.

29:45.880 --> 29:50.880
Just one of the many active
volcanoes that have shaped Iceland's

29:50.880 --> 29:53.080
volatile, unstable landscape.

29:54.760 --> 30:00.800
Hekla itself forms part of a 25-mile
long volcanic ridge that last

30:00.800 --> 30:03.360
erupted 21 years ago.

30:04.560 --> 30:07.760
The fact that its next eruption
is now considered by many

30:07.760 --> 30:11.840
to be overdue only made it all
the more predictable

30:11.840 --> 30:15.800
that this was where we'd been told
to head to spend the night.

30:16.960 --> 30:21.680
Everywhere you look in this place,
there's evidence of some massive

30:21.680 --> 30:25.240
force of nature having smashed
the landscape to bits,

30:25.240 --> 30:27.800
or flattened it, or blown it up.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.080
It's just so wild.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.960
I was never sure if wilderness were
my thing, but I've got to say

30:33.960 --> 30:36.000
I am absolutely loving this.

30:37.840 --> 30:40.760
Look at the change of scenery now,
on the right-hand side.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.440
Did you see that sign we just
passed, son?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.680
Only four-by-fours allowed
on this road.

30:51.680 --> 30:55.520
I feel like one of them
Great British explorers heading

30:55.520 --> 30:58.560
off into unchartered territories.

30:58.560 --> 31:02.320
Captain Cook, Scott of
the Antarctic, Shackleton.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.280
You know they all died on their
voyages, don't you, buddy?

31:08.040 --> 31:13.080
And Captain Cook had a boat, not
a Rolls-Royce!

31:13.080 --> 31:15.400
Maybe. But, to be fair,

31:15.400 --> 31:17.080
if he'd had the Chevette,

31:17.080 --> 31:19.600
he'd almost certainly

31:19.600 --> 31:21.800
have died sooner.

31:21.800 --> 31:26.040
Oh! Why did I choose
this bloody car?

31:26.040 --> 31:28.040
Why did I choose this bloody car?

31:28.040 --> 31:31.880
How are you feeling about your
choice now, honestly?

31:31.880 --> 31:33.080
Terrible.

31:33.080 --> 31:37.760
Not to worry, though, because just
a few more easy miles up the road...

31:37.760 --> 31:38.920
Whoa!

31:38.920 --> 31:44.920
..we finally reached our overnight
refuge, at the foot of a volcano.

31:46.120 --> 31:50.040
That's a lava field behind it.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.000
This is right in the firing line.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.560
Oh, there's a picnic table
there, a little basket.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.680
Oh.

32:07.240 --> 32:10.320
Have you got a spare coccyx?
I'm broken.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.240
I don't think I'll ever tire of
seeing you getting out of that car.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.880
Oh.  Look at this, though, eh?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.280
What a spot, Patrick.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.840
Little picnic. Job's a good 'un.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.920
Fortnum and Mason's hamper.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.080
Oh, let me see.  Other hampers
are available.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.400
Oh, don't, don't.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.040
Of course.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.480
BLEEP. Don't.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.280
Every hard-working expedition
needs its rations.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.720
BLEEP me.

32:38.720 --> 32:44.480
And ours was a selection of
traditional Icelandic delicacies.

32:46.520 --> 32:47.720
No!

32:47.720 --> 32:50.320
How are you even touching that?
They've taken the brain out. Look,

32:50.320 --> 32:52.360
you see its tongue and its teeth
here.  Oh!

32:52.360 --> 32:54.880
Let's get a fork out and have a go
at it. Come on.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.040
How do you get in it?
That looks good, in there.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.160
What's that?  Well, that looks good
there.  Buried goose!

33:01.520 --> 33:02.800
No, no, Chris.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.560
That's pretty good.  You're on
your own.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.800
I've got some crunchy nutters
in the car.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.560
Ram's testicles.  Where?  There.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.120
They're an odd shape.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.800
I'm going to try a bit of testicle
on bread.  You're not.

33:13.800 --> 33:14.960
Why not?

33:14.960 --> 33:18.560
Oh! No, no, no!

33:20.200 --> 33:21.760
It's got a real, salty hit to it.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.840
Urgh!

33:24.600 --> 33:28.600
To be honest, I think
I've had my fill for the day.

33:28.600 --> 33:32.200
The only trouble is, it's about
half ten at night.

33:32.200 --> 33:36.000
It's broad daylight.  Can I tempt
you with some mutton?  No, no, no.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.240
Uh, I've just noticed,
no curtains.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.400
Great.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.720
I don't know whether to say
goodnight or good morning,

33:47.720 --> 33:49.360
but, anyhow, see you in a bit.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.720
Oh, that's good gear, Pad.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.760
Get out!

34:03.760 --> 34:05.600
THEY LAUGH

34:08.880 --> 34:12.920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:19.640 --> 34:24.800
Fred, the one time we really needed
you - lifting stuff and eating

34:24.800 --> 34:26.520
horrendous things, where were you?

34:26.520 --> 34:28.360
Genuinely, I'm gutted I
wasn't there.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.240
You know what I'm most gutted about?
I didn't get a chance to drive

34:31.240 --> 34:33.520
that Range Rover.  Yeah.  And it was
a lovely choice, Fred,

34:33.520 --> 34:34.840
but if I'm nit picking,

34:34.840 --> 34:37.480
you could have gone for the
three-door because the late

34:37.480 --> 34:39.520
great Charles Spencer King...
On the plus side,

34:39.520 --> 34:41.200
you did swerve three days of that.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.800
I suppose self-isolating isn't
too bad after all. Anyhow,

34:44.800 --> 34:47.560
it's time to move on and talk
about this -

34:47.560 --> 34:49.480
the Chevrolet Camaro.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.640
Actually, my Chevrolet Camaro.
Which used

34:51.640 --> 34:54.400
to be my Chevrolet Camaro.
I know, Chris. I know.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.760
Kaching.
No shame whatsoever.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.360
The point is, I've always been
a sucker for fast American cars,

35:00.360 --> 35:03.080
but I had to admit, they're not
built for British roads.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.040
They're not refined. And the
steering wheel's on the wrong side.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.080
But now there's an American sports
car that promises to solve all that.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.320
Here it is.

35:19.320 --> 35:24.080
The all-new Chevrolet Corvette.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.000
For the first time ever,

35:26.000 --> 35:29.040
it's got its engine behind
the driver,

35:29.040 --> 35:32.680
and it's got its steering
wheel on the right.

35:34.800 --> 35:40.280
This all-American hero is starting
to look a lot like one of your fancy

35:40.280 --> 35:42.000
European sports cars.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.280
The question is - does it go
like one?

35:48.280 --> 35:51.200
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.200
Knock it down a couple of gears.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.400
And...

35:59.240 --> 36:01.720
Oh! There she goes!

36:01.720 --> 36:03.240
She flies!

36:05.040 --> 36:07.840
Oh, my word. 100mph already!

36:11.080 --> 36:14.360
Nought to 60
in just over three seconds.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.680
184mph top speed.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.080
That isn't sports car fast.
That's supercar fast.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.560
This is one quick car.

36:32.920 --> 36:37.800
And that's thanks to Chevy's
6.2 litre, small-block V8,

36:37.800 --> 36:41.360
making over 480 horsepower.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.760
I love it!

36:45.760 --> 36:49.000
Only the Americans can put
the word "small" anywhere

36:49.000 --> 36:50.800
near a six litre engine.

36:51.880 --> 36:52.920
Bonkers!

36:55.080 --> 36:59.160
The thing is, though, American
sports cars have never struggled

36:59.160 --> 37:01.760
with going fast in a straight line.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.880
The problem's always been corners.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.680
And when you do reach a corner in
your Corvette,

37:12.680 --> 37:13.720
you discover...

37:16.800 --> 37:18.880
..it is brilliant!

37:20.720 --> 37:22.480
Oh, whoa!

37:24.760 --> 37:27.240
HE LAUGHS

37:30.680 --> 37:34.720
Old Corvettes, we'd have been in
a wrestling match on track,

37:34.720 --> 37:37.160
but this one is with you.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.760
It's a whole other fighter.

37:44.760 --> 37:49.320
The gearbox is a fancy
dual-clutch paddle shift.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.960
You can even have clever magnetic
shock absorbers.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.480
And having the engine behind
the driver means you're right

37:59.480 --> 38:01.800
in the thick of it. You know

38:01.800 --> 38:03.680
exactly what's going on,

38:03.680 --> 38:06.760
and what's going on is all good!

38:16.960 --> 38:20.480
And it's the same story inside.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.440
Sitting in an American car

38:22.440 --> 38:26.440
has traditionally been a cheap
and cheerful experience.

38:26.440 --> 38:29.800
But the Corvette's interior
is anything but.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.880
There's leather everywhere.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.080
There's screens and cameras
everywhere.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.560
There's even one in the rear view
mirror.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.440
And look at this. Press this,

38:39.440 --> 38:42.600
it records your driving, overlaid
with data on how fast

38:42.600 --> 38:46.040
you're going and the G-force.
It does the whole lot.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.240
And it's got a pop-out roof, so it's
a convertible, too.

38:50.240 --> 38:54.040
Seriously, you've got everything you
need in here, and it doesn't feel

38:54.040 --> 38:55.560
cheap and cheerful.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.720
It feels expensive and cheerful.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.000
So, how expensive is
the new Corvette?

39:06.440 --> 39:08.120
Well, that depends.

39:09.440 --> 39:14.360
See, in America, these cars start
at $60,000.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.400
That's £45,000.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.080
£45,000 for a nearly 500 horsepower,

39:22.080 --> 39:23.320
mid-engine sports car.

39:25.480 --> 39:29.560
I know Corvettes have always been
about bang for your buck.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.840
But that's an absolute steal.

39:34.160 --> 39:38.520
If you can't pay in bucks, though,
it's not quite such good news.

39:39.800 --> 39:45.280
The Corvette we get over here
starts at 75 grand.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.840
This one has tested...

39:49.200 --> 39:50.440
..85 grand.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.040
Come on, America!

39:54.040 --> 39:55.760
We gave you the English language.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.440
We gave you the internet.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.760
We gave you...James Corden.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.280
And this is how you repay us?!

40:06.920 --> 40:08.520
But here's the thing.

40:08.520 --> 40:13.960
Even at that price, this car
is still a total bargain.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.520
Nothing else,

40:18.520 --> 40:23.040
nothing else you can buy in the UK
right now gives you this much

40:23.040 --> 40:25.760
performance for your pound,

40:25.760 --> 40:27.520
this much car for your cash.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
Pound for pound for fun!

40:33.120 --> 40:34.640
This is right up there.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.560
I'm struggling to find something
I don't like.

40:47.720 --> 40:49.360
HE LAUGHS

40:49.360 --> 40:50.560
Come on!

40:56.000 --> 40:57.360
I'm a Northerner.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.640
I love a bargain!

41:00.160 --> 41:02.680
Stick some gravy on it, I'm sold!

41:12.920 --> 41:16.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:19.760 --> 41:21.720
Look at his face. Look at him!

41:21.720 --> 41:25.040
Not a happy chappy.  What's wrong
with you?  OK.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.680
This could go on a while,
but I'll keep it short.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.640
It looks like two cars sewn together
in the middle. Doesn't look right.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.760
It's not coherent, there's too much
volume back here.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.640
But most importantly, I don't want
a mid-engine Corvette.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.440
It should be an American muscle car,
front end to rear wheel drive.

41:38.440 --> 41:42.000
I'm going to put it in terms that
you'll understand - biscuits.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.600
Oh, right.  Jaffa Cakes.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.480
Yes.  A Jaffa Cake should have
marmalade orangey stuff in it.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.840
Not one of these new ones
with cherry or lime.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.280
I want to know what I'm getting.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.840
American muscle car.
This is trying to be a Ferrari.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.880
It's trying to be European.
He has got a point.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.480
But, listen, there's plenty of
muscle car fans out there.

41:57.480 --> 42:01.560
So, Fred, would you keep the Camaro
or trade up to the Corvette?

42:01.560 --> 42:03.120
Do you know what?

42:03.120 --> 42:06.040
I like this car, but I love
that one.

42:06.040 --> 42:09.480
Yes, Fred!  When we put them nose
to nose, I've not even

42:09.480 --> 42:11.120
looked at this.  Yeah.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.800
It's just all about that for me.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.280
I love that car.
Paid over the odds, but love it.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.040
LAUGHTER

42:17.040 --> 42:20.520
Right, now it's time to do something
else we've not done for a while.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.400
We're going to put this car
around our track in the hands

42:23.400 --> 42:25.120
of The Stig.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.240
Engine in the middle means more
weight over the rear wheels,

42:34.240 --> 42:36.360
which means better traction
off the line.

42:40.040 --> 42:43.520
Sounding great, normally
aspirated V8.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.120
It's greasy out there. Stig reckons
these sorts of conditions

42:46.120 --> 42:48.360
can cost at least three or four
seconds a lap.

42:50.040 --> 42:54.360
You can see the suspension almost
fighting the roll there.

42:54.360 --> 42:57.480
Through Chicago. Looks flat
and fast.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.080
Stig working his way through
the eight-speed box.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.240
No, manual option
on this Corvette.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.760
Breaking hard at the Hammerhead.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.360
Not so much stability on the brakes.

43:07.360 --> 43:10.320
Really fighting to keep the car in
a straight line

43:10.320 --> 43:12.880
Using all of the tarmac.
A little bit of grass, too.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.000
Down into the Follow Through.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.240
And he had a little bit of a brake
there! Unusual for The Stig.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.720
Second-to-last, the most difficult
corner, pick your entry point.

43:25.720 --> 43:29.400
He's fighting it all the way
in little steering inputs.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.920
Through Gambon now, what's he going
to do? Bit of grass.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.520
Over the line.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:38.080 --> 43:40.120
So, it's a damp lap.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.080
What do you think?  I'm thinking it's
got to be faster

43:44.080 --> 43:45.880
than the M3.  OK.

43:45.880 --> 43:48.000
It was a damp lap.  Pressure's on.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.520
The time was

43:49.520 --> 43:53.800
1:21.7.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.240
There it is.

43:55.240 --> 43:57.000
AUDIENCE OOHS

43:57.000 --> 43:59.800
OK.
Just under the F-Type.  Damp time.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.440
Damp time.  And this is the top of
the board, isn't it?

44:02.440 --> 44:05.560
Well...  We've tested a lot
more cars, haven't we, Pad?

44:05.560 --> 44:07.800
I have thought of this, gentlemen.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.640
What do you mean you've thought
of it?  I've knocked this up today.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.720
HANDLE SQUEAKING AND LAUGHTER

44:12.720 --> 44:14.440
Oh, now, Patrick!

44:14.440 --> 44:16.000
Eh?  You've excelled yourself here.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.440
Needs a bit more WD-40, I've got to
be honest.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.640
I'm liking that, Pad.  Won't be
a minute.

44:20.640 --> 44:24.400
Still going.  So, it could be about
four seconds quicker.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.280
Here we go. Boom.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.800
It's sort of Honda NSX speed,
isn't it?

44:28.800 --> 44:31.120
You've just pointed
somewhere you can reach.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.960
LAUGHTER

44:33.960 --> 44:37.320
So, there you go. Mid-table, not
relegation.

44:37.320 --> 44:40.160
And now it's time to get back to our
big Iceland adventure,

44:40.160 --> 44:42.000
where Fred was still stuck in the UK

44:42.000 --> 44:44.800
and our British expedition
vehicles were about to be put

44:44.800 --> 44:46.360
to the ultimate test.

44:51.960 --> 44:55.560
With the Icelandic summer
and its never-ending daylight

44:55.560 --> 44:57.960
waking us bright and early...

44:57.960 --> 44:59.320
Look at that.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.840
..it was time to find out

45:00.840 --> 45:04.760
what the last leg of our mini
expedition had in store.

45:06.320 --> 45:09.400
Good night's sleep, that, Pad.
Surprisingly nice, that.

45:09.400 --> 45:10.760
Oh, challenge!

45:16.520 --> 45:20.840
"Iceland is the home of proper
expedition vehicles.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.560
"To see how adventurous your cars
really are,

45:23.560 --> 45:26.120
"you will now race against the king
of the locals."

45:30.160 --> 45:31.280
Oh, God.

45:33.520 --> 45:38.320
This absolute monster is
a Ford F-150 pick-up,

45:38.320 --> 45:43.040
modified by Icelandic off-road
legends, Arctic Trucks.

45:46.440 --> 45:49.880
Their vehicles have been used to
conquer some of the most hostile

45:49.880 --> 45:51.280
terrains on the planet.

45:54.400 --> 45:58.560
But as if that wasn't enough of an
unfair advantage, their latest

45:58.560 --> 46:03.160
creation would, of course,
be driven by The Stig.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.800
This is a problem.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.640
The ultimate expedition machine,

46:10.640 --> 46:12.480
driven by the ultimate driving
machine.

46:14.080 --> 46:20.160
And we're racing him in a Chevette
and an old Silver Shadow.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.560
Yeah.  Right.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.120
And then there was the race route.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.400
Continuing to follow the rough
tracks that coursed

46:30.400 --> 46:33.080
through the Icelandic interior,

46:33.080 --> 46:35.680
we'd have to find our way to
the edge

46:35.680 --> 46:37.560
of the Raudhaskal crater.

46:38.960 --> 46:43.320
The finish line was just 20
odd miles away, but as part

46:43.320 --> 46:47.120
of the Hekla volcanic ridge, it lay
at the heart of one

46:47.120 --> 46:50.320
of the world's most active
volcanic regions.

46:51.320 --> 46:55.040
So, to give us at least a fighting
chance,

46:55.040 --> 46:58.200
we'd get a 30 minute head start.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.240
Just long enough, the producers
reckoned, for us to reach

47:01.240 --> 47:03.440
the finish line first,

47:03.440 --> 47:08.800
if our budget Brits didn't,
as they put it, die trying.

47:14.480 --> 47:17.000
Right, rally, boy.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.560
We're a team on this. Don't
be shooting

47:19.560 --> 47:22.240
off in the old Croquette and leaving
me for dead.

47:24.320 --> 47:28.040
Here we go.  Three, two, one.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.080
Go!

47:34.800 --> 47:37.200
What's he doing? What's he doing?

47:37.200 --> 47:38.560
What are you doing?

47:38.560 --> 47:40.440
My strategy is the faster I go,

47:40.440 --> 47:41.960
I reckon the faster you'll go.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.920
Oh! Now we're moving.

47:47.040 --> 47:50.400
All kinds of stones thrown
at the Silver Lady!

47:51.920 --> 47:55.280
So, with just half an hour to get
as far ahead of The Stig

47:55.280 --> 47:59.840
as possible, apparently teamwork
had gone straight out the window.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't see
a thing!

48:04.040 --> 48:07.520
But having spent the whole trip
waiting for Harris's Chevette

48:07.520 --> 48:10.240
to make any kind of sense,

48:10.240 --> 48:13.880
it was at least nice to be there
for the big moment.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.680
Woo! What a fantastic bit of road.

48:22.920 --> 48:26.160
Finally! My choice is paying
dividends.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.720
This is driving!

48:30.600 --> 48:32.880
There he is. Go on, Harris!

48:34.720 --> 48:37.360
The Chevette is still so agile.

48:37.360 --> 48:38.640
Straight-cut gears!

48:42.160 --> 48:43.280
This is fun!

48:45.880 --> 48:47.240
Oh, she's singing!

48:48.440 --> 48:49.760
Oh, she is singing.

49:01.280 --> 49:05.320
While Stig bided his time
before the hunt began,

49:05.320 --> 49:09.560
with "Chrissi Makinen" pulling away
fast, it was all me and my Shadow

49:09.560 --> 49:11.760
could do to hang on to the back
of him.

49:13.480 --> 49:16.320
Oh, flat chat down here. Come on!

49:17.560 --> 49:18.720
Whoa!

49:20.240 --> 49:21.440
Oh, BLEEP.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.960
Phwoar, that one crept up on me.

49:28.720 --> 49:32.760
I can still see that little
Croquette's dust in front of me.

49:33.880 --> 49:34.920
Come on.

49:46.360 --> 49:48.120
This is rallying old-school.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.200
They used to do hundreds of miles
like this.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.280
No notes, just driving on site.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.120
Crest.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.400
Whoa. Big jump.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.520
Oh, sugar.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.560
Feels like my left suspension is
a bit different to my right.

50:26.040 --> 50:28.040
This looks a bit jumpy.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.480
Oh!

50:31.360 --> 50:35.000
She's moving about is the girl.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.400
Oh!

50:38.760 --> 50:43.840
How often are you going to get
the chance to take a Silver Shadow

50:43.840 --> 50:46.440
rallying in Iceland?

50:48.320 --> 50:52.280
Up ahead, though, it was quickly
becoming clear that my approach

50:52.280 --> 50:57.200
to rallying in Iceland
had been a little overenthusiastic.

50:58.760 --> 51:02.360
Moving down to third and I think
the Chevette's not very happy!

51:03.640 --> 51:05.480
Engine's bogged down.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.600
Either that or I'm losing power.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.280
I could be.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.840
I want to be going quick.

51:14.840 --> 51:18.240
But I'm trying to get the car round
in one piece as well.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.800
It's literally like rallying on
the moon!

51:22.840 --> 51:25.240
Oh, my engine's not sounding
very good now.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.880
We've got engine issues, I think.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.160
Can't see Pad, I don't know where
he is.

51:35.400 --> 51:38.240
And then things got worse.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.040
Caution there.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.160
Oh.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:46.920 --> 51:49.680
Not very clearly signposted.

51:49.680 --> 51:54.400
It turns out, on those rough tracks
that cut across the Icelandic

51:54.400 --> 51:57.560
backcountry, missing a turn is easy.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.560
Almost as easy, in fact,

52:01.560 --> 52:03.880
as grinding to a halt altogether.

52:08.840 --> 52:10.000
I'm stuck.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.520
Still, it's not like we were
being chased.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.520
Yes.

52:28.520 --> 52:33.160
Our 30 minutes were up and Stig
was on the hunt.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.160
Oh, I can see him. There he is.

52:51.480 --> 52:54.360
Is he stopped? Oh, my God, he's
stopped. What's he doing?

52:54.360 --> 52:56.120
Have you stopped? What's going on?

52:58.200 --> 52:59.720
The directions weren't very clear.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.960
I went straight on and now
I can't get moving.

53:03.080 --> 53:05.240
I'm going to nudge up to you,
ready?

53:10.920 --> 53:11.960
Oh.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.640
We're off!

53:16.240 --> 53:19.400
A lovely bit of rescue service from
the roller there!

53:19.400 --> 53:21.960
Teamwork makes the dream work.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.920
The plucky Brits
might have been back on the move,

53:26.920 --> 53:30.240
but as Stig smashed across the plane
somewhere behind us...

53:31.920 --> 53:36.400
..soon it was the Shadow's turn
to start feeling the pressure.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.760
Jesus, it's bumpy here, Chris!

53:44.440 --> 53:48.320
I think I've lost power steering or
I've got a puncture.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.920
Lost power as well. Bloody hell!

53:49.920 --> 53:53.000
Philips is hanging out the tape
deck. Get in!

53:56.960 --> 54:00.520
Come on, Pad. Get that roller going.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.880
Slowing down a bit on me.
Come on, girl!

54:04.160 --> 54:08.360
This is where The Stig will gain
valuable time

54:08.360 --> 54:11.480
on us, cos he'll go over those rocks
like they're nothing,

54:11.480 --> 54:13.720
like they're popping candy.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.200
Some of these crests are
a bit blind.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.080
Watch out for the ridges
coming up! It's got...

54:36.840 --> 54:39.600
Big lump down the middle.
Be careful, all right?

54:39.600 --> 54:41.080
Oh, that looks a bit ominous.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.080
Oh!

54:44.080 --> 54:45.480
Oh-ho!

54:47.240 --> 54:50.000
Go on, the Silver Lady!

54:50.000 --> 54:51.120
Cheers, pal.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.080
The landscape had been taking
its toll.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.800
It's getting hot in here now.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.360
Come on, old girl.

55:09.360 --> 55:13.240
But our cars were still just about
hanging on.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.400
Raudhaskal was now just six
miles away.

55:19.120 --> 55:23.560
And as we began the final push,
round to the crater's edge,

55:23.560 --> 55:25.000
the real question was...

55:26.120 --> 55:27.680
..where was our pursuer?

55:30.600 --> 55:32.240
Can't see The Stig.

55:33.280 --> 55:34.320
Still can't see him.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.440
Can't see the Stig, pal!

55:38.480 --> 55:40.600
Oh, we're down to three now.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.000
I've only got three cylinders, so
you'll have to bear with me.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.080
My engine's dying.

55:45.840 --> 55:47.720
Come on, come on.

55:51.920 --> 55:54.080
I can't see The Stig... Oh, Jesus,
he's here!

55:57.240 --> 55:58.360
Oh, no.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.160
That's a big rock!

56:02.160 --> 56:03.320
Oh, God!

56:04.480 --> 56:07.800
Go, Pad. Come on, Pad.

56:10.040 --> 56:14.120
Hold on, Silver Shadow! Come on!

56:16.200 --> 56:17.920
It's going to be tight.

56:19.640 --> 56:22.640
Come on, come on, the Shadow!

56:24.280 --> 56:26.400
Come on, Pad. Keep up, mate!
Come on, Pad.

56:26.400 --> 56:27.920
We're going to drag you along.

56:29.800 --> 56:30.840
He's on me!

56:33.560 --> 56:35.000
Come on, Paddy McGuinness!

56:36.400 --> 56:37.960
I'm here, son!

56:37.960 --> 56:39.280
He's right on me.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.600
Argh! Get round.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.840
Oh!

56:47.600 --> 56:48.960
Go on, get up there!

56:48.960 --> 56:50.520
Come on, the roller.

56:51.800 --> 56:52.840
We have got him!

56:55.240 --> 56:57.440
Oh! Made it!

56:57.440 --> 56:59.120
Yeah! What?!

57:00.760 --> 57:02.320
CHUCKLING

57:08.960 --> 57:10.000
Oh!

57:11.280 --> 57:12.800
Wow!

57:12.800 --> 57:15.680
We've done it, son!  Wow.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.080
Woo!

57:17.080 --> 57:20.520
We've just raced to the top
of a volcano.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.040
I'll tell you what...

57:23.080 --> 57:24.920
There he is!

57:24.920 --> 57:26.720
Good work.  Never in doubt.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.280
There he is.

57:28.280 --> 57:29.320
Oh!

57:31.000 --> 57:32.240
Look at that.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.360
That is immense.

57:37.760 --> 57:40.040
That over there, all lava.

57:41.480 --> 57:44.000
Do you know that?
That's unbelievable.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.840
I love the way this is
a voyage of learning for you.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.400
Oh, drink it in.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

58:00.200 --> 58:02.560
Found a volcano.  Wow.

58:04.520 --> 58:09.160
What a trip. Great cars,
unbelievable scenery, and we beat

58:09.160 --> 58:11.880
The Stig to the top of the volcano.
It was fantastic.

58:11.880 --> 58:13.600
The only thing missing was you,
big man.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.920
I'm still gutted. I would love to
have been there.

58:15.920 --> 58:18.040
I've got serious FOMO. Serious.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.600
What about the cars? Little
soldiers, both of them.  Yes.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.600
Widebody Chevette, Fred.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.280
Look at that.  Yeah.

58:24.280 --> 58:27.720
Well, it's time to decide who bought
the best car.

58:27.720 --> 58:30.000
Obviously, Chris, you're going
to go with the Croquette.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.160
Yes.  Yeah.

58:31.160 --> 58:33.960
And I'll go for the Silver Lady,
which means casting vote's

58:33.960 --> 58:36.320
yours, Fred, and I bet you're going
to go with Chris,

58:36.320 --> 58:37.600
cos it's his Chevette.

58:37.600 --> 58:40.000
"Ooh, it's Chris's Chevette."
LAUGHTER

58:40.000 --> 58:41.640
Really?  "Ooh!"

58:41.640 --> 58:44.360
All right, then. On the one hand,
I'm looking at a blue car

58:44.360 --> 58:46.480
with a big white dot on the bonnet.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.920
Yep.  This one, I'm looking at
a national treasure,

58:49.920 --> 58:53.360
an institution. Something
with better class, well-built,

58:53.360 --> 58:55.480
obviously unlike the driver.

58:55.480 --> 58:58.880
So, for that reason, I'm going
Rolls-Royce.

58:58.880 --> 59:00.800
Sorry, Chris. Rolls-Royce!

59:00.800 --> 59:03.360
I can't believe it! I can't
believe it!

59:03.360 --> 59:05.120
I love a Royce, I love them!

59:05.120 --> 59:06.720
Double teapot.  Pathetic.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.640
That's it for tonight, but more good
stuff next week.

59:09.640 --> 59:12.320
The big lad becomes a qualified
racing driver.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.520
The little lad drives a DeLorean.

59:14.520 --> 59:17.840
And I drive a car worth £4 million.

59:17.840 --> 59:20.480
Thanks so much for watching.
See you, then. Goodnight!

59:20.480 --> 59:24.600
CHEERING AND APPLAUE
