What do you want?

03:42.133 --> 03:44.501
I'm here about the room.

03:45.567 --> 03:48.300
No pets, no parties,

03:48.367 --> 03:50.067
no loud music.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.434
This is a quiet building.

03:51.501 --> 03:55.167
I'm a grad student at
the university, doing my thesis.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.234
I just need a quiet place
to study.
Student?

03:58.300 --> 04:01.200
Then I'm gonna need an extra
month's rent in advance.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.534
Well, I can't afford
another month's rent.

04:03.601 --> 04:05.968
Aw, come on, man.
I really need this apartment.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.067
Well, I don't like
rentin' to students.

04:08.133 --> 04:11.801
Young people--
they have no respect.

04:11.868 --> 04:14.434
[grunts]
This one's on welfare already.
[baby cries]

04:14.501 --> 04:17.200
And she owes me
two month's rent.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.233
Hey, you know anybody
who needs a place?
No.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.267
Ah.
[sniffs]

04:24.667 --> 04:27.634
[grunts]
This is the room.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.968
[door creaks]

04:39.100 --> 04:43.467
There's a $100 security deposit
for damage to the furnishings.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.868
And it's not refundable.

04:49.634 --> 04:52.501
Ya ain't gonna find
any cheaper than this.

04:52.567 --> 04:54.868
Yeah, I know.

04:54.934 --> 04:56.534
I'll take it.

05:14.634 --> 05:16.033

Ah, are you all right?
[baby screams]

08:13.968 --> 08:17.167
Do you need help?
Hel-- Hello?

08:17.234 --> 08:20.734
It won't stop!
It won't go away!
Oh, God!

08:20.801 --> 08:22.901
It won't leave us alone!

It's okay, it's okay.
It's gone now.

08:36.833 --> 08:40.267
Don't let it come back.
Please, just help me.
All right, I'll help you.

08:40.333 --> 08:44.100
It's okay.
I'll be right back.
Where are you going?

08:55.300 --> 08:57.667
Mr. Dumbrowski.
What do you want?

08:57.734 --> 09:00.400
The woman upstairs
was attacked by a large rat.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.067
Is that what all
that screamin' was about?

09:03.133 --> 09:04.734
I thought somebody was dying.

09:04.801 --> 09:09.234
You tell her that she better
keep it down, and th-th-that
kid of hers, too!

09:09.300 --> 09:10.734
Whoa! It almost bit
the baby.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.667
You gotta get
exterminators in here.

09:12.734 --> 09:16.501
Right. So she can claim
that her kid ate rat poison
and then try to sue me!

09:16.567 --> 09:19.868
This house is infested
with rats! I can hear them
in the walls.

09:19.934 --> 09:24.000
Hey! You put him up
to this, Masurewicz, huh?

09:24.067 --> 09:26.334
Is this more
of your nonsense?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.601
Look, I saw it
attack her and the baby.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.968
Come on, man--

09:31.033 --> 09:32.934
You gotta do something
about the rats.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.534
[exhales]
This house is over
300 years old.

09:36.601 --> 09:38.467
Of course it has rats.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.868
Every building in this
godforsaken neighborhood
has rats!

09:42.934 --> 09:46.400
Here. You fix it.
Wha--

09:46.467 --> 09:50.000
[door opens]
[Masurewicz]
Mister...

09:51.601 --> 09:54.901
You saw a rat?
Yeah.

09:54.968 --> 09:56.834
A big one?

09:57.901 --> 09:59.467
Yeah.

09:59.534 --> 10:01.701
With a face?

10:03.734 --> 10:05.234
A human face?

10:09.234 --> 10:11.133
Uh, I don't know
what you mean.

10:32.234 --> 10:34.200
That should do it.
Are you sure?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.300
Yeah. It won't get
back in that way.

10:36.367 --> 10:39.567
Well, maybe somewhere else.

10:39.634 --> 10:42.667
[sighs] 
I don't see any other place
it could fit through.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.000
[sighs]

10:44.067 --> 10:45.667
Well, thank you.
You're safe now.

10:45.734 --> 10:47.934
You're a hero.
[chuckles]

10:48.000 --> 10:50.367
No, I'm Walter Gillman.
I just moved in next door.

10:50.434 --> 10:54.367
Oh, uh, Frankie.
Well, Frances...Howard.

10:54.434 --> 10:56.300
And this is Danny.
[baby coos]

10:56.367 --> 10:57.901
Hi.

10:57.968 --> 10:59.934
Hi, fella.
[Danny coos]

11:01.334 --> 11:04.267
He likes you.
[Danny coos]

11:05.534 --> 11:08.133
[chuckles]
Can I make you some tea?

11:08.200 --> 11:12.200
Ah, no, no, that's okay.
I gotta get back
and study, so...

11:12.267 --> 11:13.801
Oh. Oh, you're a student.

11:13.868 --> 11:16.601
Yeah. Grad student
at the "U".

11:16.667 --> 11:19.534
One day this guy's 
gonna get a college degree.

11:21.267 --> 11:24.868
[softly]
Yeah, you're all right, baby.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.767
[Frances chuckles]
Okay.

11:27.834 --> 11:28.901
Okay.

11:31.968 --> 11:33.133
So, uh...

11:36.267 --> 11:40.200
Hey, thanks again
for the, uh--
Yeah.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.133
Bye.

11:53.968 --> 11:56.267
[rustling sound]

12:01.801 --> 12:03.167

12:09.234 --> 12:11.133

[wind gusting]

12:45.767 --> 12:47.234
[rat]
Hey, there.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.400
Hey, there.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.534
[gasps]

12:53.601 --> 12:56.767
She's coming.
She's coming for you.

12:56.834 --> 12:58.300
Mm-hmm.

12:58.367 --> 12:59.934
[shouts]

13:04.000 --> 13:05.534

13:31.801 --> 13:33.567
[loud knocking]

13:42.968 --> 13:44.367
[whispering]
Who is it?

13:44.434 --> 13:46.601
It's me, Frankie.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.901
Hey.

13:51.968 --> 13:53.734
Are-- Are you okay?

13:53.801 --> 13:56.701
Ah, yeah. Yeah,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.667
Well, I thought I heard--

13:58.734 --> 14:00.467
It sounded like
somebody screamed.

14:00.534 --> 14:04.300
It's nothing.
A nightmare, you know.
Oh.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.133
Hope I didn't wake the baby.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.501
No, he slept through
a rock concert once.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.267
Are you sure
that you're okay?

14:13.334 --> 14:16.167
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine, really, yeah.
Hmm...

14:17.834 --> 14:19.567
[Walter]
No problem.

14:19.634 --> 14:21.968
Okay. Uh...

14:22.033 --> 14:24.434
How about that
cup of tea?

14:26.234 --> 14:27.834
So, what are you studying?

14:27.901 --> 14:30.534
Working on something
called string theory.
Oh.

14:30.601 --> 14:34.167
It's totally non-Euclidean.
One of its propositions is,
that everything that we know

14:34.234 --> 14:36.834
that exists,
exists on one plane,
we call them membrane.

14:36.901 --> 14:41.367
And we know, by calculations,
there are of a number of other
membranes on the universe.

14:41.434 --> 14:44.601
Somewhere as many as 11
dimensions, but my bookshelves,
I think, so far,

14:44.667 --> 14:48.968
that at certain angles,
two membranes can intersect.

14:49.033 --> 14:52.167
And if you know where
they cross and how
to recognize those angles,

14:52.234 --> 14:55.400
you can go from one universe
to the other.

14:55.467 --> 14:58.367
Huh.
[chuckles] 

15:00.367 --> 15:03.467
So...you're packing?

15:03.534 --> 15:07.267
I'm a little
behind on the rent,
so Dumbrowski's evicting us.

15:07.334 --> 15:09.267
We're leaving in the morning.

15:09.334 --> 15:15.100
Where you gonna go?
There are, um, places.

15:15.167 --> 15:18.767
I need to get a job soon
and we'll find
a better home than this.

15:19.934 --> 15:21.434
How much do you owe him?

15:23.567 --> 15:27.801
No, I'm not taking your money.
I can lend you the money.
It's not a big deal.

15:27.868 --> 15:30.234
I don't even know you.
Look...

15:32.100 --> 15:33.501
Here, 50 dollars.

15:33.567 --> 15:36.067
I bet he'll let you
stay another week for that.

15:36.133 --> 15:37.868
You're a student.
You can't afford that.

15:37.934 --> 15:40.200
Or why would you be living
in this rat hole?

15:40.267 --> 15:43.334
I grade papers for
this professor and he pays me.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.701
It's just for a week...
till you get that job.

15:46.767 --> 15:49.567
So Danny doesn't have to go
to one of those places.

15:54.601 --> 15:56.167
[sighs] 

15:56.234 --> 16:01.567
[exhales]
With this and what I've got,
he might let us stay.

16:01.634 --> 16:05.734
But I'm paying you back
by next week.
All right.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.133
Would you like another cup?
Ah, no. No, no.
That's okay.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.200
I gotta finish those papers
and I gotta study and...

16:14.267 --> 16:15.601
Oh.
Yeah, I better go.

16:18.667 --> 16:22.033
Well, uh, good night, then.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.300
And...thank you.

16:25.367 --> 16:28.133
Yeah. Yeah.
Good night.

16:34.467 --> 16:35.968
[sighs] 

16:51.367 --> 16:54.167
[loud bang]
[man chanting]

16:56.467 --> 16:58.968
Oh, God!

16:59.033 --> 17:02.434
[loud bang]
[man chanting]

17:15.501 --> 17:17.133
[sighs]

17:31.968 --> 17:33.300
Excuse me.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.501
[continues chanting]

17:35.567 --> 17:37.200
Sir!

17:40.067 --> 17:41.534
Excuse me!

17:43.067 --> 17:44.434
[kisses]

17:46.601 --> 17:48.634
You saw it.

17:49.868 --> 17:52.767
The rat...
with a face?

17:52.834 --> 17:54.434
That was a dream.

17:54.501 --> 17:55.934
No dream.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.033
You-- You put
the idea in my mind.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.667
I went to sleep
and dreamt it.

18:00.734 --> 18:03.267
It is her familiar.

18:03.334 --> 18:06.234
She is hunting you.
Who?

18:06.300 --> 18:08.000
Who are you talking about?

18:08.067 --> 18:11.834
The witch. Did you
see her in your dream?

18:11.901 --> 18:16.467
Look, uh, I just need
some quiet in this house
so I can study.

18:16.534 --> 18:19.734
Can you please pray
a little more quietly?

18:19.801 --> 18:21.634
She is coming for you.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.033
Yeah, well, I don't
believe in witches, okay?

18:24.100 --> 18:26.467
You will.

18:26.534 --> 18:27.834
[sighs]

18:27.901 --> 18:29.234
Please.

18:30.734 --> 18:35.400
No, I gotta go study.
I seen her,
the demon bitch...

18:35.467 --> 18:37.334
many times.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.968
What are you trying
to say to me, huh?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.734
Hmm.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.601
No.
I come to this house,

18:47.667 --> 18:49.701
like you, a young man.

18:49.767 --> 18:51.767
Poor man.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.634
Is cheap, is quiet.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.734
But this house...

18:58.868 --> 19:00.534
is evil.

19:03.801 --> 19:05.400
I lived where you live.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.334
Huh.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.234
Then...I have dreams,

19:10.300 --> 19:12.934
like you.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.067
Then...

19:16.834 --> 19:19.901
What-- Then you--
You saw the witch?

19:19.968 --> 19:21.801
Her eyes--

19:23.267 --> 19:26.167
I still see her eyes.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.467
She made me do
terrible things.

19:31.534 --> 19:34.067
Then why stay
in this house?

19:34.133 --> 19:37.701
I work, I pray
to stop her.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.067
Here.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.000
Take this.

19:46.067 --> 19:48.267
Come on, man.
Look, no thanks.

19:48.334 --> 19:52.734
It was just a dream.
No, no.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.667
No dream.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.601
Walter, hey. Can you
do me a favor, please?

20:20.667 --> 20:23.934
Sure. What?
I just got a call
about a job interview.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.634
Can you just watch Danny for me,
for maybe an hour or two?

20:27.701 --> 20:28.667
Uh...

20:29.767 --> 20:31.200
Okay.
Yeah?

20:31.267 --> 20:35.200
But I never babysat before.
You'll be great.
He loves you.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.467
Look who it is, Danny.
[Danny coos]

20:38.534 --> 20:41.100
Hey, so what happens
if he has to be--

20:41.167 --> 20:44.901
No, no, I just changed him
and I fed him
and he should be fine.

20:44.968 --> 20:46.367
He's a good boy.
Okay.

20:46.434 --> 20:48.467
I promise you,
I won't be too long.

20:48.534 --> 20:51.467
I just--
I really need this job.

20:51.534 --> 20:55.334
I'll be able to pay you back.
Don't worry.
I'll be glad to watch him.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.167
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

20:58.234 --> 20:59.701
[kisses]
Bye, baby.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.567
Wish me luck.
Yeah, good luck.

21:01.634 --> 21:04.934
Bye. You boys have
a good time.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.901
See ya.

21:10.934 --> 21:12.734
[Danny coos]

21:16.634 --> 21:20.934
So, I'll tell you a secret
if you promise not
to tell your mom.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.434
I think she likes me.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.367
I think I like her.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.400
[Danny crying softly]

21:36.467 --> 21:39.267
It's okay.
It's okay, fella.

21:39.334 --> 21:40.868
[quietly]
It's okay.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.634
I'll take care of you.

22:11.067 --> 22:12.567
[sighs]

22:21.434 --> 22:23.100

24:02.367 --> 24:03.567

25:30.434 --> 25:32.100
[panting]

25:44.100 --> 25:46.501
[panting]
Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:47.901 --> 25:49.133
Oh, God.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.434
[Danny cries]

25:52.501 --> 25:53.968
Danny!

26:00.200 --> 26:02.100
[grunts]

26:02.167 --> 26:04.601
Walter?
[Danny screams]

26:04.667 --> 26:06.501
Danny!

26:09.000 --> 26:11.367
It's okay, baby.
Hey, honey.

26:11.434 --> 26:12.701
It's Mama.
[sighs]

26:12.767 --> 26:15.601
You're all right.
What happened?

26:15.667 --> 26:19.167
I don't know. I just--
I fell asleep for a second.

26:19.234 --> 26:22.534
Where? Why did you leave him?
I didn't!

26:22.601 --> 26:24.367
I mean, I nodded out
right there.

26:24.434 --> 26:28.000
Right there.
Are you on drugs?

26:28.067 --> 26:32.200
[Danny cries]
Shh, shh.
Everything's okay.

26:34.501 --> 26:39.434
I need to borrow some flour.
Flour? Why?

26:39.501 --> 26:43.868
The only explanation for 
what happened is I-I must
have been sleepwalking.

26:43.934 --> 26:47.133
Sleepwalking?
[panting]
Look.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.334
I've been having weird dreams.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.534
I mean, like, really,
really intense dreams.

26:53.601 --> 26:57.000
And I think maybe I've started
to walk in my sleep.

26:59.033 --> 27:00.901
[groans]

27:05.434 --> 27:10.234
Oh, look I-I don't know what
happened, but I promise you,
I would never leave Danny alone.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.934
Okay? I would never
leave Danny alone.
Please believe me.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.501
What do you need
the flour for?

27:28.534 --> 27:30.400
There.

27:30.467 --> 27:35.067
Now, if I get out of bed,
even if I'm not conscious of it,
I'll leave a trail.

27:36.801 --> 27:39.634
Maybe you should
see a doctor?

27:39.701 --> 27:42.434
I mean, to help you
with these dreams.

27:42.501 --> 27:45.434
Wha-- You mean a psychiatrist?

27:45.501 --> 27:47.701
We all need help
sometimes, right?

27:47.767 --> 27:50.467
Yeah, well, in the morning
I'll know for sure.

27:51.934 --> 27:53.534
So will you.

27:56.267 --> 27:59.300
Well, I'll see you
in the morning, then.

28:01.501 --> 28:03.167
Good night.

28:27.767 --> 28:29.033
[groans]

29:13.367 --> 29:15.100

29:19.601 --> 29:20.901

[rustling sound]

29:35.400 --> 29:37.701
[deep exhale]

29:37.767 --> 29:40.534
Just a dream.
It's just a dream.

29:45.601 --> 29:48.133
[wind gusting]

29:50.701 --> 29:52.767
[quick footsteps]

30:34.300 --> 30:36.801

30:45.868 --> 30:47.501
[eerie exhale]

30:59.834 --> 31:01.701
[loud thud]

31:23.968 --> 31:25.234
Sign.

31:33.534 --> 31:34.701
[hisses]

31:34.767 --> 31:36.133
[groans]

31:46.234 --> 31:49.767

[indistinct whispers]

31:54.200 --> 31:56.067

Sign!

31:58.167 --> 32:00.334
[eerie laugh]

32:00.400 --> 32:02.467

Oh, my God.

32:25.701 --> 32:27.234
[moaning]
Oh, my God.

32:38.567 --> 32:41.000
Oh, my God!

32:41.067 --> 32:43.000
[winces]

33:49.033 --> 33:50.667
Oh, my God.

33:50.734 --> 33:51.667
Oh, my--

33:57.234 --> 33:59.200
[exhales]

34:04.968 --> 34:08.467
What are you doing here?
[gasps]

34:08.534 --> 34:10.601
This is a restricted area.

34:10.667 --> 34:13.601
The rare book room
is always locked.

34:13.667 --> 34:17.167
How did you get in?
I don't know.

34:17.234 --> 34:22.000
But how did you get
this book?

34:22.067 --> 34:26.367
No one has permission
to see the Necronomica.
No one!

34:27.634 --> 34:29.868
Who let you in?
Please, I--

34:29.934 --> 34:31.534
[yells]

34:31.601 --> 34:34.833
[gasping]
Security!

34:34.900 --> 34:36.333
Wait a second!
[yells]

34:36.400 --> 34:37.601
Help!

34:37.667 --> 34:39.467
Security!

34:55.400 --> 34:57.334
[panting]
Walter, what's wrong?

34:57.400 --> 34:59.901
Get Danny and leave now!
What? Why?

34:59.968 --> 35:01.701
'Cause he's in danger.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.634
From who?
What kind of danger?
The dreams!

35:04.701 --> 35:07.801
They're real.
The witch and the rat.
You've seen the rat!

35:07.868 --> 35:10.133
Walter, you're scaring me.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.968
They want Danny
for some sick ceremony.

35:12.033 --> 35:13.968
They need a child
to sacrifice!

35:14.033 --> 35:16.400
Listen to me.
You have to stop this now.

35:16.467 --> 35:19.400
Your have to see a doctor
and get medication.
You're not thinking straight.

35:19.467 --> 35:22.667
No, no! It's real!
It's in the book
in the library!

35:22.734 --> 35:25.167
The walls in my room--
the membranes meet.
That's how they get in.

35:25.234 --> 35:27.667
They're hiding in
another universe!
Get help.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.834
No!
Hey! Walter!

35:29.901 --> 35:31.701
Look! Look, you believe!

35:31.767 --> 35:35.133
You believe that he needs help,
that he needs protection.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.834
You need to take him
away from here, from me.
I have nowhere else to go.

35:38.901 --> 35:41.901
I can't afford any place else.
Get a hold of yourself.

35:41.968 --> 35:45.701
They want me to do it!
To take him!
I don't know why. Look!

35:45.767 --> 35:50.033
Oh, God, what did
you do to yourself?
Listen to me.

35:50.100 --> 35:53.367
If I go to sleep again,
I don't know if
I can protect him.

35:53.434 --> 35:57.501
I don't know if I can
control myself. They want me
to kill your son!

35:57.567 --> 36:00.100
That's enough!
Get away from him!

36:00.167 --> 36:02.601
Get out of here now
or I'm calling the police!
Listen--

36:02.667 --> 36:04.400
Get out, now!
Wait a minute!

36:04.467 --> 36:06.000
Walter, no!

36:09.234 --> 36:10.968
Oh!

36:15.834 --> 36:18.801
[knocking]
[Man]
Hello?

36:22.767 --> 36:24.934
Hello!

36:31.467 --> 36:33.868
It's old Joe.

36:33.934 --> 36:36.167
I bring coffee
from my country.

36:36.234 --> 36:40.501
It's very strong.
Thanks.

36:40.567 --> 36:42.367
Mmm.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.267
You are having the dreams?

36:46.334 --> 36:49.634
They're not dreams.
They're real.

36:49.701 --> 36:52.200
She has come.

36:52.267 --> 36:54.467
Your soul is in peril.

36:54.534 --> 36:55.801
Look.

36:55.868 --> 36:58.634
I think I figured it out,
how she does it.

36:58.701 --> 37:01.434
Witches were astrologers, huh?

37:01.501 --> 37:03.434
They use science.

37:03.501 --> 37:06.200
She must have discovered
the intersection.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.334
She goes back and forth
between dimensions.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.133
If I can find the secret
to the intersection,

37:11.200 --> 37:14.868
I can trap her and that thing
in the other universe,
I can stop her!

37:14.934 --> 37:19.467
You cannot stop her.
She has marked you.

37:19.534 --> 37:23.400
She has made you her man!
Well, I have to stop her!

37:23.467 --> 37:28.133
If she comes back again,
I can't fight her!
You must run away, now!

37:28.200 --> 37:30.367
No. If I run,
she'll take Danny.

37:30.434 --> 37:32.601
She can take him, yes.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.667
But she needs a human soul,
a man, to make the sacrifice.

37:36.734 --> 37:41.300
To complete the ritual,
the devil, he does not
thirst for blood,

37:41.367 --> 37:44.000
he thirsts for souls!

37:44.067 --> 37:46.234
Well, then I have
to stop her now.

37:46.300 --> 37:49.100
I tried to stop her.

37:49.167 --> 37:52.434
I prayed and I prayed.

37:52.501 --> 37:55.267
I should have run,
run away,

37:55.334 --> 37:59.634
and then,
I-I wouldn't...have--

38:03.000 --> 38:04.601
You killed a child,
didn't you?

38:10.901 --> 38:13.000
Children.

38:13.067 --> 38:17.033
I-- I killed...children.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.334
She made me.

38:23.434 --> 38:25.033
Look.

38:28.167 --> 38:29.501
Look.

38:29.567 --> 38:31.400
[heavy sigh]

38:34.000 --> 38:38.100
Why didn't you turn yourself in?
Why didn't you tell someone?

38:39.334 --> 38:41.200
I did.

38:42.267 --> 38:43.868
They wouldn't believe me.

38:45.467 --> 38:47.200
Here.

38:54.467 --> 38:58.334
God have mercy
on your soul.

39:20.434 --> 39:22.334
[grunts]

39:30.801 --> 39:32.400
[Man, yelling]
Hey!

39:32.467 --> 39:34.667
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

39:37.701 --> 39:41.033
Don't hit me.
I-I'll call the cops.

39:41.100 --> 39:42.667
Don't hit me!

39:51.567 --> 39:53.400

43:28.267 --> 43:30.667

43:32.701 --> 43:34.667
Kill him!

43:34.734 --> 43:36.167

43:36.234 --> 43:38.400
You kill him!
Kill, kill, kill!

43:38.467 --> 43:41.868

Soon, you kill him.
[Danny screams]

46:46.400 --> 46:47.667
Walter, open the door!

46:49.701 --> 46:52.968
[chants in foreign language]

46:56.334 --> 46:58.100
[crying]
Walter!

46:58.167 --> 47:00.968
Walter!

47:01.033 --> 47:05.567
Walter's inside!
Open the door!
Gillman! Gillman!

47:05.634 --> 47:08.801
Damn you!
You're in trouble now!

47:10.167 --> 47:11.567
Go on!
Danny!

47:11.634 --> 47:13.234
[Walter]
Oh, God.
[Frances yells]

47:16.834 --> 47:18.968
Danny?

47:23.133 --> 47:25.167
[gasps]

47:27.133 --> 47:30.467
[crying]

47:30.534 --> 47:35.868
[shouting]
Why? Why did you do this
to Danny?

47:41.834 --> 47:46.400
She'd wait until
I was asleep.

47:46.467 --> 47:48.767
And then she'd come.

47:48.834 --> 47:52.734
She found the intersection.

47:52.801 --> 47:55.400
[Woman]
The intersection?
Yes!

47:55.467 --> 48:00.067
Of universes. That's how
she'd get into my room
and then disappear.

48:00.133 --> 48:05.000
Now, this woman
would just disappear?
[shouts] Yes!

48:05.067 --> 48:08.133
That's what happens
when you travel
through space and time!

48:08.200 --> 48:10.501
And is this why
you killed the baby?

48:10.567 --> 48:13.734
The evil witch
cast a spell--
No! No!

48:13.801 --> 48:16.701
I already told you!
I did not kill Danny!

48:16.767 --> 48:20.300
Yes, you told us.
The rat did it.

48:20.367 --> 48:24.267
The rat with the human face.
[whimpers]

48:24.334 --> 48:26.968
Now, Walter, listen to me.

48:27.033 --> 48:30.234
You threatened
the child's mother.

48:30.300 --> 48:33.701
You were caught
with the body.
[whimpers]

48:33.767 --> 48:36.033
You were covered
with the child's blood.

48:36.100 --> 48:39.033
You've got to face
what you did.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.534
I tried! I tried
to save him!

48:43.234 --> 48:45.834
I killed the witch.
She's still there--
her body must be!

48:45.901 --> 48:47.868
I'm telling you the truth!

48:47.934 --> 48:50.901
[crying]
Why won't you listen to me?

48:59.601 --> 49:02.634
That's classic
paranoid-schizophrenia,

49:02.701 --> 49:05.200
brought on by the stress
of graduate school, I imagine.

49:05.267 --> 49:07.734
Is he competent
to stand trial?

49:07.801 --> 49:11.267
He's intelligent
but he's completely psychotic.

49:11.334 --> 49:14.434
He can't face what he's done.
He probably never will.

49:14.501 --> 49:16.934
Either way, he's going
to be locked up for life.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.701
I wanna do better than that.

49:21.367 --> 49:23.234
I'm not sure
you're gonna like this.

49:23.300 --> 49:26.701
What have you got?
We've recovered
skeletal remains,

49:26.767 --> 49:29.934
full and partial,
of over 70 bodies.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.601
All of 'em are children.

49:31.667 --> 49:36.200
Some of them are infants
less than a year old.
Jesus!

49:36.267 --> 49:38.834
Our Mr. Gillman's
been a very busy boy.

49:38.901 --> 49:41.000
So, uh, what's the problem?

49:41.067 --> 49:44.834
All of the remains
we've tested so far
are at least 30 years old.

49:44.901 --> 49:49.534
The oldest are from over
300 years ago.
What?

49:49.601 --> 49:53.767
And the boy, Danny,
has what appears to be animal
bites on the side of his neck.

49:53.834 --> 49:56.801
And the DNA-- It's--

49:56.868 --> 49:58.868
Gillman's?
No.

49:59.801 --> 50:01.801
We can't identify it.

50:03.367 --> 50:05.567
It's not like anything
we've ever seen before.

50:07.534 --> 50:08.701
And then, there's this.

50:13.467 --> 50:15.067
So what are you saying?

50:15.133 --> 50:19.000
Well, none of this
makes any sense unless
you believe his story.

50:19.067 --> 50:21.501
What story?
The witch and the rat?
Yeah.

50:21.567 --> 50:26.300
None of this exonerates Gillman.
No, but we've got to disclose
this to the defense.

50:26.367 --> 50:29.868
Go ahead.
Who's going to believe him?

50:42.100 --> 50:44.067
[sighs]

51:16.901 --> 51:18.167
[cries]

52:12.033 --> 52:15.033
[Man screams]

52:22.133 --> 52:25.000
Gillman!
[screams]

52:25.067 --> 52:27.834
Doctor! Doctor!

52:29.667 --> 52:31.601
[gasps, chokes]

52:38.968 --> 52:40.167
What's wrong?

52:41.934 --> 52:43.767
[all gasp]

52:43.834 --> 52:46.467
[rat growling]
[screams]

52:49.868 --> 52:51.734
[rat chuckles]

52:52.901 --> 52:54.467
[gasps]

52:54.534 --> 52:56.868
[weak groan]

53:09.167 --> 53:10.567
Jesus.

53:17.968 --> 53:19.434
[crow screeches]
