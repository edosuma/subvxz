22:59:00.163 --> 00:02.756
The Simpsons

00:06.386 --> 00:07.469
D'oh!

00:09.000 --> 00:15.074

00:23.444 --> 00:27.948
Ah, there's nothing better
than relaxing with
my favorite magazine.

00:31.869 --> 00:35.872
Oh, they're showing
the filling now.
Can they do that?

00:37.542 --> 00:38.959
What the hell is that?

00:40.878 --> 00:44.214
Rainbows. Tank tops.
Empowerment.

00:44.298 --> 00:47.217
This is the
gay pride parade!
Woo-hoo!

00:48.469 --> 00:51.513
We're here!
We're queer! Get used to it!

00:51.597 --> 00:54.641
You do this every year!
We are used to it!

00:54.976 --> 00:56.226
Spoil sport!

01:01.524 --> 01:02.733
Uh...

01:02.817 --> 01:06.903
Oh, honey. Think pink!
Look, a salute to safe sex.

01:14.662 --> 01:16.413
We're gay.
We're glad.

01:16.497 --> 01:18.248
But don't tell
Mom and Dad.

01:18.458 --> 01:21.334
Wouldn't it be great
if that man and woman
got together?

01:21.419 --> 01:24.129
Cool! It's Lesbians
of the Caribbean!

01:24.213 --> 01:27.924
Yo, ho, ho
It's an alternative
lifestyle for me

01:32.472 --> 01:36.683
Oh, a salute to brunch!
Wave to brunch, Maggie.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.942
Oh, look at those abs.
Everyone here has a six-pack

01:46.027 --> 01:47.819
and I'm the only one
with a keg.

01:47.904 --> 01:49.529
Oh, God! Cover up!

02:10.050 --> 02:11.760
That's it!
We're out of here!

02:17.350 --> 02:19.810
Four tickets
for Shenani-Goats!

02:19.894 --> 02:21.853
Why is this movie PG-13?

02:21.938 --> 02:25.482
"It may contain
brief rudeness,
adult explosions,

02:25.566 --> 02:27.526
"and scenes with
Garry Shandling. "

02:31.531 --> 02:34.741
These are so easy.
It's obviously Tom Hanks.

02:38.246 --> 02:39.246
Who?

02:39.330 --> 02:42.666
Otm Shank.
He is India's answer
to Brian Dennehy.

02:43.584 --> 02:45.252
Otm Shank.

03:04.897 --> 03:05.939
Uh-oh.

03:19.287 --> 03:21.621
Come on!
Show the movie!

03:23.082 --> 03:25.876
Justin's soccer team
was in last place...

03:27.795 --> 03:31.214
You suck!
No wonder your parents
are getting divorced!

03:31.299 --> 03:33.800
...until they
dug up a new player.

03:34.468 --> 03:37.596
Ed O'Neill is Soccer Mummy.

03:37.847 --> 03:38.972
PLAYING)

03:39.056 --> 03:41.349
I feel good

03:42.560 --> 03:45.896
Go, Soccer Mummy!
You taught me to
believe in myself!

03:45.980 --> 03:48.148
I feel good

03:51.652 --> 03:52.652
Uh-oh!

03:52.778 --> 03:55.071
The professor said
not to let him get a boner!

03:59.869 --> 04:01.244
I'm laughing!

04:01.329 --> 04:03.663
But it's a laugh
of impatience!

04:03.748 --> 04:04.789
Show the movie!

04:08.961 --> 04:12.255
So many previews.
So many previews.
So many previews.

04:12.340 --> 04:15.133
And now,
our feature presentation.

04:16.344 --> 04:20.471
If that's a phrase
you like to hear,
then you'll love Movie Call!

04:23.684 --> 04:25.268
Start the movie!

04:25.353 --> 04:28.772
Start the movie!
Start the movie!

04:28.856 --> 04:30.690
Start the movie!
Start the...

04:30.775 --> 04:32.067
They're out of control!

04:32.151 --> 04:33.735
Well, if we wanted
to live forever,

04:33.819 --> 04:35.820
we wouldn't
have become ushers.

04:44.413 --> 04:47.540
Stop the madness!
Start the movie!

04:47.625 --> 04:50.043
Maybe we should
try to calm Dad down.

04:50.127 --> 04:51.544
I prefer to egg him on.

04:51.629 --> 04:54.381
Hey, Dad, has
the movie started yet?

04:57.843 --> 04:59.636
Homer, you're going
to get in trouble.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.346
I'm not scared
of those ushers.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.598
What are they gonna do?
Advance on me?

05:05.476 --> 05:07.644
This ends here!

05:14.068 --> 05:17.404
And so,
for helping to KO
litter in our community,

05:17.738 --> 05:20.907
I hereby dedicate this statue
of Drederick Tatum!

05:21.742 --> 05:23.785
Litter is my most
treacherous foe.

05:23.869 --> 05:25.412
I would like to
eat its children.

05:26.789 --> 05:28.415
So long, suckers!

05:33.546 --> 05:36.881
My mouth.
My beautiful mouth!

05:37.842 --> 05:38.967
Excellent bout.

05:39.051 --> 05:41.094
Now we go party.

05:43.681 --> 05:46.182
Homer, you've suffered
a broken jaw.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.851
Broken jaw!

05:50.938 --> 05:53.106
He won't be able to talk
for quite some time.

05:53.190 --> 05:56.735
I've wired his jaw shut.
It's all explained
in this pamphlet.

05:58.988 --> 06:00.321
Hmm.

06:00.406 --> 06:04.034
Oh, dear!
You can't eat solid foods!

06:04.118 --> 06:05.535
Those are his favorites!

06:05.619 --> 06:07.495
I can't eat solid food!

06:09.874 --> 06:11.041
Stop it, Homer!

06:11.125 --> 06:12.834
Oh, don't worry.
On a man his size,

06:12.918 --> 06:14.586
that just provides
sexual release.

06:29.810 --> 06:30.810
Uh-oh.

06:35.524 --> 06:37.734
Hey, Dad,
I'm gonna make
a human yo-yo.

06:37.818 --> 06:40.445
If you object,
clearly say no.

06:40.529 --> 06:43.198
No!
No objections, eh?
That's great.

06:46.327 --> 06:48.578
Milhouse,
you ready to imitate
that Jackass show?

06:48.662 --> 06:51.372
All those disclaimers
made me want to do it more!

06:54.835 --> 06:56.461
Oh, yeah!

06:58.255 --> 07:03.009
Hey, Duff lovers!
Does anyone in
this bar love Duff?

07:03.135 --> 07:04.511
Hey, it's Duffman!

07:04.595 --> 07:06.721
Newsweek said you died
of liver failure.

07:06.806 --> 07:10.266
Duffman can never die!
Only the actors who play him!

07:10.684 --> 07:11.768
Oh, yeah!

07:11.852 --> 07:14.938
You must be here for the
Duff Trivia Challenge.

07:15.022 --> 07:16.856
That's right,
local distributor.

07:16.941 --> 07:20.485
One of you could win
a lifetime supply of Duff!

07:22.363 --> 07:24.155
Okay, chug monkeys,

07:24.532 --> 07:27.200
"What beverage
brewed since ancient times

07:27.284 --> 07:29.953
"is made from
hops and grains?"

07:30.246 --> 07:32.705
How about ancient
hop grain juice?

07:32.873 --> 07:35.333
Beer! Beer! Beer!

07:35.543 --> 07:37.585
Wait, wait, wait.
Homer's trying to
make a guess.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.295
Beer, beer, beer!

07:41.423 --> 07:44.843
What are you doing?
You're getting some kind
of booze all over me!

07:46.512 --> 07:50.181
Time's up!
The answer is beer!

07:50.432 --> 07:52.725
Ooh. Duff luck.

07:52.935 --> 07:54.394
I never would've
figured that out.

07:54.478 --> 07:57.397
That's the kind of thing
you just gotta know.

08:04.029 --> 08:07.240
I am not gonna make you
another sparerib smoothie.

08:07.449 --> 08:11.035
Most people with
their jaws wired shut
don't gain weight.

08:19.712 --> 08:22.797
"How was your day?"
Do you really want to know?

08:22.882 --> 08:23.840
Uh-huh.

08:23.924 --> 08:25.842
Well, let's see.

08:26.260 --> 08:30.471
I was in the kitchen
counting the corncobs
on the curtains,

08:30.556 --> 08:34.267
when who should
ring the doorbell
but Ned Flanders.

08:38.355 --> 08:41.357
It seems he wants to
ban culottes in the schools.

08:42.568 --> 08:46.279
Pardon my French,
but sometimes that
man's a goofy-doofy.

08:46.447 --> 08:48.406
Marge thinks
Flanders is annoying.

08:48.490 --> 08:51.159
This marriage
just got interesting.

09:00.461 --> 09:03.004
She's so cute.

09:18.812 --> 09:19.812
Ah!

09:24.318 --> 09:25.318
Uh-oh.

09:31.659 --> 09:33.952
You want to know
what happened?

09:35.496 --> 09:36.746
Really?

09:40.084 --> 09:43.670
We were playing foursquare
and I called no double taps,

09:43.754 --> 09:45.505
and Ralph double taps.

09:45.589 --> 09:50.343
And I said, "You're out,"
and he says, "I can do
a summersault,"

09:50.678 --> 09:53.054
which had nothing
to do with anything!

09:53.138 --> 09:54.264
Aw!

09:54.348 --> 09:57.558
Maybe a hug
will cork her cry hole.

09:57.935 --> 09:59.978
Thanks for listening, Dad.

10:05.734 --> 10:07.277
We gotta coordinate
on this thing.

10:07.361 --> 10:08.528
Uh-huh.

10:10.155 --> 10:11.447
So the substitute
teacher comes in

10:11.532 --> 10:14.117
and says
her name is Mrs. Doody,

10:14.201 --> 10:17.537
and everyone's
looking at me like,
"Take it, Bart. Run with it. "

10:17.621 --> 10:20.748
Then it hits me.
I've become a clown.

10:21.709 --> 10:25.295
A class clown.
And it sickens me.

10:25.754 --> 10:28.256
Wow,
Bart has feelings.

10:28.340 --> 10:29.924
Mrs. Doody.

10:30.718 --> 10:34.262
Three wars back
we called sauerkraut
"liberty cabbage,"

10:34.346 --> 10:37.056
and we called
liberty cabbage "super slaw!"

10:37.141 --> 10:40.935
And back then,
a suitcase was known
as a Swedish lunchbox.

10:41.145 --> 10:43.604
'Course,
nobody knew that but me.

10:44.898 --> 10:47.275
Anyway, "Long story short"

10:47.609 --> 10:51.279
is a phrase whose origins
are complicated and rambling.

10:52.906 --> 10:56.826
You know,
tomorrow is the Annual
Springfield Formal Event.

10:57.244 --> 11:01.539
We weren't going to go
after last year's
unpleasantness.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.668
That donkey is such
a bad influence on you.

11:05.753 --> 11:08.421
But breaking your jaw
has made you so sweet.

11:08.505 --> 11:09.714
Maybe we can go.

11:09.798 --> 11:10.923
Mmm-hmm.

11:11.550 --> 11:14.927
Mmm. I better polish
those jaw wires
for tomorrow.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.734
A formal!

11:30.110 --> 11:33.780
The one place
you can wear a tiara
and not look crazy.

11:33.906 --> 11:35.156
Uh-huh!

11:35.240 --> 11:37.950
So, how are we
enjoying the festivities?

11:40.788 --> 11:44.248
Yes. The music is
from southern Hungary.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.918
That's quite an ear.
Have some money.

11:49.338 --> 11:51.547
Your husband is
quite the gentleman.

11:51.632 --> 11:53.758
Most people laugh
at my googly eye.

12:01.934 --> 12:03.726
Well, I've never
seen a man

12:03.811 --> 12:06.020
politely pass up
so many hors d'oeuvres.

12:06.730 --> 12:10.650
My husband,
Maxtone Witherball,
has already had three shrimp!

12:11.235 --> 12:13.236
Someone's done
her henpecking.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.657
You two are quite the couple.
You must dine with us
at Toad Hall.

12:18.659 --> 12:19.992
Thank you.

12:31.672 --> 12:35.842
This has been
one of the most magical
evenings of my life.

12:36.677 --> 12:38.469
I'm horny.

12:39.513 --> 12:43.266
I don't know what you said,
but I'm sure it
was beautiful.

12:43.434 --> 12:46.310
Oh, Homer. This is
the kind of night

12:46.395 --> 12:48.688
I thought we could
never have together.

12:48.856 --> 12:50.523
Incident-free.

12:57.698 --> 12:58.698
Mmm-mmm.

13:06.707 --> 13:08.958
Oh, Homer,
drop by my office tomorrow

13:09.042 --> 13:11.294
and I can remove
those jaw wires.

13:11.378 --> 13:14.046
You'll be just the way
you used to be.

13:17.009 --> 13:20.887
And Reverend,
I'll put in those
pec implants on Thursday.

13:21.305 --> 13:22.513
Super.

13:28.562 --> 13:31.939
Homer,
your breath smells terrible.

13:32.024 --> 13:34.817
I'll have to
take off my shoes
to cover the odor.

13:34.902 --> 13:36.277
Nicely done.

13:36.445 --> 13:39.530
And when I couldn't talk,
I learned to listen.

13:39.615 --> 13:42.074
I learned so much
about my family.

13:42.326 --> 13:43.993
You'd be surprised
how much you hear

13:44.077 --> 13:45.703
if you just listen
once in awhile.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.580
Really? Let's try it.

13:47.873 --> 13:51.459
Hello?
Yeah. I'd like to arrange
for an escort, please.

13:52.419 --> 13:57.423
To where?
How about Orgasmville!
You... Hello? Hello?

13:58.926 --> 14:00.176
Oh! Hey.
How you doing?

14:00.260 --> 14:01.594
I was just
telling all the guys

14:01.678 --> 14:04.180
how losing
the power of speech
made me a better man.

14:04.264 --> 14:05.806
I couldn't agree more.

14:05.891 --> 14:08.184
You're today's modern,
enlightened man,

14:08.268 --> 14:09.727
the kind
we television producers

14:09.811 --> 14:11.771
have been booking
since the mid '70s.

14:11.855 --> 14:13.189
Hey, what are you
doing in here?

14:13.273 --> 14:14.607
I'm an alcoholic.

14:14.691 --> 14:16.776
Homer, will you appear
on my show?

14:16.860 --> 14:18.528
Sure thing, alky.

14:21.406 --> 14:23.407
Welcome to Afternoon Yak.

14:24.743 --> 14:28.746
Today we will meet a man
who couldn't open his mouth,

14:28.830 --> 14:31.165
so he learned to
open his heart.

14:31.458 --> 14:34.126
Please welcome
Homer and Marge Simpson.

14:37.297 --> 14:39.257
So, Marge, tell.

14:39.550 --> 14:42.885
What's it like
kissing a man with
a mouth full of metal?

14:42.970 --> 14:45.471
My boyfriend has
a metal tongue stud.

14:45.556 --> 14:47.723
Who cares
what's on his tongue,

14:47.808 --> 14:49.934
as long as he's
a stud where it counts!

14:50.269 --> 14:52.270
I'm talking downtown!

14:53.897 --> 14:57.149
Marge,
what was Homer like
before he broke his jaw?

14:57.317 --> 15:00.319
Well, he would eat
all the time.

15:00.404 --> 15:01.529
We'd be making love

15:01.613 --> 15:04.865
and he'd have a mouth full
of Hershey's Miniatures.

15:04.992 --> 15:06.617
Krackel was my favorite.

15:06.702 --> 15:09.829
I hope that was
the only miniature
in the bedroom.

15:09.913 --> 15:11.789
I'm talking downtown!

15:13.750 --> 15:16.669
And before
he broke his jaw
he never listened,

15:16.753 --> 15:19.672
but now he takes to heart
everything I say.

15:21.049 --> 15:22.758
Well, as much
as humanly possible.

15:24.177 --> 15:26.846
Well, Marge told us
when you didn't listen,

15:26.930 --> 15:29.599
it led to weckless,
criminal behavior.

15:29.725 --> 15:32.143
He did such crazy things.
Roll the clip.

15:32.269 --> 15:35.062
Ostrich burgers!
Get your ostrich burgers!

15:35.147 --> 15:36.314
I'll take one.

15:36.398 --> 15:38.566
Okay. You pick one out
and I'll punch it to death.

15:38.650 --> 15:39.692
Hmm.

15:40.944 --> 15:43.321
Hey there,
little sweet...

15:47.951 --> 15:49.619
Dude, I thought
we were friends!

15:51.038 --> 15:52.788
Well, I'm not proud
of that clip.

15:52.873 --> 15:57.335
Homela, it's easy to change,
but what's hard is
not changing back.

15:57.794 --> 16:01.797
Do you promise not to
revive your weckless,
weckless ways?

16:02.049 --> 16:05.801
I don't know.
The Demolition Derby
is next month.

16:06.094 --> 16:10.139
Please, Homie?
No more craziness?
For me?

16:10.432 --> 16:13.893
Well, okay.
For you, I'll be
as dull as Dilbert.

16:13.977 --> 16:18.356
Very good. Our next topic,
"My Son Still Wets the Bed. "

16:19.524 --> 16:22.068
You told me we were
going to Red Lobster!

16:27.032 --> 16:30.534
Hmm. All clean,
just the way I left it.

16:30.619 --> 16:32.119
I'm gonna kill you!

16:32.204 --> 16:34.538
Well, so much for
the new Homer.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.625
What's going on?

16:37.918 --> 16:39.251
We're rehearsing a play.

16:39.461 --> 16:43.339
Yes, and I was
merely reading the title,
I'm Gonna Kill You.

16:43.757 --> 16:46.509
Oh. It's just
a false alarm.

16:46.593 --> 16:49.387
Yep. Nothing to get
excited about.

16:49.471 --> 16:52.431
Well, I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

16:53.517 --> 16:56.018
Professor Van Doran,
so good to see you.

16:56.603 --> 16:59.063
Ah. Rehearsing
a play, I see.

17:01.274 --> 17:06.278
This place is so dull.
The 911 button is
covered with dust.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.531
I just poured myself
a new glass of milk.

17:08.615 --> 17:10.616
The old one sat out
for a little while.

17:10.701 --> 17:11.701
Are you coming to bed?

17:11.785 --> 17:13.160
It's 7:30.

17:13.244 --> 17:15.954
Marge, I could stand here
and argue with you,

17:16.039 --> 17:19.959
but then I'd have to get
a new glass of milk.
Good night, honey.

17:20.292 --> 17:22.336
Boy, things are
going really good.

17:22.421 --> 17:24.922
Good, good, good, good,
good, good, good!

17:25.464 --> 17:26.464
Hmm.

17:26.550 --> 17:29.468
Look at that freckle.
I should dig that out.

17:32.097 --> 17:34.682
Good. Good.
That feels good.

17:40.063 --> 17:43.232
This place
is so boring!

17:43.692 --> 17:46.235
If somebody doesn't do
something interesting,

17:46.319 --> 17:48.696
I'm gonna have to!
But what?

17:55.162 --> 17:56.912
The Demolition Derby?

17:56.997 --> 17:59.582
Oh, that'll scratch my itch.

18:02.002 --> 18:06.338
Marge? Marge is gone!
But at least the Demolition
Derby form is...

18:07.424 --> 18:09.383
What? No!

18:19.436 --> 18:21.896
Ooh, listen to
all that revving!

18:21.980 --> 18:24.273
Drivers,
start your engines!

18:28.570 --> 18:30.696
Vendors,
start your gouging!

18:31.239 --> 18:32.948
I'll pay anything!

18:33.033 --> 18:35.409
And now,
smashie-smashie!

18:39.706 --> 18:41.540
Looking good, Mrs. S.

18:43.210 --> 18:46.754
Uh-oh. Come on, old girl.
Show them what you got.

18:48.590 --> 18:49.715
Whoa!

18:53.553 --> 18:56.013
Catch you later, radiator!

18:56.348 --> 19:00.392
Oh, my God. I hit someone.
Then I taunted him.

19:00.894 --> 19:02.436
I've never felt more alive!

19:06.441 --> 19:09.902
What was I thinking
trying to feel alive?
Forget that!

19:13.406 --> 19:17.201
Don't hurt me!
I'm not like you people!
I'm loved!

19:20.080 --> 19:22.122
I caught a head!

19:22.207 --> 19:25.084
Oh, dang!
It's been scooped out.

19:29.798 --> 19:32.758
Go around! Go around!

19:36.429 --> 19:37.513
There she is!

19:39.391 --> 19:41.517
Dad, you've gotta
do something!

19:41.601 --> 19:44.019
But bold moves are
no longer my forte.

19:44.104 --> 19:46.063
She could get hurt!

19:46.189 --> 19:48.190
What do I do?
What do I do?

19:48.567 --> 19:50.317
Wait, I know.
Beer here!

19:50.402 --> 19:51.402
Sure, sonny.

20:03.123 --> 20:05.875
This beer's deliskous.
I'm gonna saves me wife.

20:05.959 --> 20:08.210
Now, let's get this show
on the road.

20:10.755 --> 20:12.339
So many dings.

20:14.301 --> 20:16.135
Quit banging my wife!

20:18.972 --> 20:20.472
A man
on a donkey!

20:20.557 --> 20:22.516
Never in my six
weeks on the job

20:22.601 --> 20:24.476
have I seen
the likes of this.

20:30.775 --> 20:34.695
Looks like
I needs some fuel for me mule.
Gas for me ass.

20:44.164 --> 20:47.374
Looks like a little angel.
Now to save me Marge!

20:49.210 --> 20:51.337
Homer, save me! Save me!

20:59.054 --> 21:02.014
He saved her!
Isn't it great to have
the old Dad back?

21:02.140 --> 21:04.683
I thought you
liked the new Dad.
Whatever.

21:08.438 --> 21:12.775
This family
needs a live wire,
but it's just not me.

21:13.026 --> 21:16.403
That's okay, Marge.
You're a good wet blanket.

21:16.696 --> 21:18.739
The kind I like
wrapped around me.

21:18.823 --> 21:19.949
Aw!

21:21.910 --> 21:24.453
When
Homer's jaw was crushed,
crushed, crushed,

21:24.537 --> 21:27.247
his life took
a nitro-burning funny turn!

21:27.332 --> 21:30.376
Oh, yeah!
It's important to
grow, grow, grow,

21:30.460 --> 21:34.254
but if you take it
to the max, max, max,
it's gonna get ugly!

21:34.422 --> 21:35.798
In the mud!

21:36.305 --> 21:42.760
