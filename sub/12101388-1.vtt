00:17.540 --> 00:19.810
<i>My name is Travis Wolfe.</i>

00:20.945 --> 00:23.113
<i>I'm 22 years old.</i>

00:23.146 --> 00:24.815
<i>Film student in Hollywood.</i>

00:26.484 --> 00:27.951
<i>Chasing my dreams.</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:30.889
<i>Everyone has a story.</i>

00:32.021 --> 00:33.158
<i>This one's mine.</i>

00:41.731 --> 00:43.467
Yo, Trav, are you cool?

00:46.003 --> 00:47.438
Everything straight, man?

00:51.341 --> 00:52.876
Look, man, someone
sleeping on the couch,

00:52.909 --> 00:55.646
it's not a great look with
a new roommate, you know?

00:55.679 --> 00:57.948
I'm only here
another week, anyways.

00:57.981 --> 01:00.518
You're still going to the
screening, though, right, huh?

01:00.551 --> 01:02.954
Come on, dude, our film's
on the big screen.

01:03.653 --> 01:04.822
I'm not done editing.

01:04.855 --> 01:06.790
And you kicking me out
isn't really helping.

01:06.823 --> 01:08.959
Why'd he have to move in
a week early?

01:08.992 --> 01:10.494
I mean the dude,
he's paying his rent,

01:10.528 --> 01:11.896
he offered to pay half mine.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.599
Any idea where you can go?

01:15.299 --> 01:16.568
I'll figure it out.

01:21.906 --> 01:23.875
Hey, I'll see you
at that party, huh?

01:25.509 --> 01:26.878
Hey, drive safe, buddy.

02:51.161 --> 02:52.796
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

03:08.277 --> 03:09.813
Wow, these are dope.

03:09.847 --> 03:13.016
Thanks, they're for my
new spring collection.

03:14.852 --> 03:16.753
I want to take more photos.

03:17.987 --> 03:19.056
Make more stuff.

03:20.390 --> 03:21.626
You should.

03:25.695 --> 03:27.598
Is your, uh, manager around?

03:28.465 --> 03:29.634
Nope.

03:30.266 --> 03:31.969
Gone for the afternoon.

04:22.452 --> 04:23.420
Excuse me.

04:24.987 --> 04:26.624
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
need the table.

04:26.656 --> 04:27.924
It's our busiest time.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.575
Hey, Travis, how are you?

04:45.608 --> 04:46.877
Good, how are you?

04:48.377 --> 04:50.014
So how's the editing coming?

04:50.680 --> 04:52.515
I recut a few scenes.

04:52.548 --> 04:54.050
Oh, well, let's see it.

04:54.084 --> 04:55.252
Sure.

04:56.552 --> 04:58.355
I really think
you're gonna like it.

04:59.389 --> 05:02.759
Spent a lot of hard work on it.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.766
I'm excited to see it.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.802
<i>If you want to get
to the root of my story,</i>

05:12.836 --> 05:16.107
<i>then you have to go back
to the day I was born.</i>

05:19.942 --> 05:25.216
<i>Never give up your passion,
passion what makes the man.</i>

05:39.930 --> 05:41.999
You're not
identifying the speaker?

05:42.699 --> 05:44.068
It's more about his words.

05:46.336 --> 05:47.571
Why do you make that choice?

05:47.603 --> 05:49.973
You haven't been following
that convention up until now.

05:50.007 --> 05:52.009
It just felt like
the right thing to do.

05:54.343 --> 05:56.947
And why the fuck did you
film half of this in VHS?

05:56.980 --> 05:58.415
I like the aesthetic.

06:00.016 --> 06:02.286
Irony is not an aesthetic.

06:04.954 --> 06:06.990
So what do you want me to do?

06:09.091 --> 06:10.827
All your classmates
are finished.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.029
You're the only one
screwing around.

06:13.062 --> 06:15.098
Do you even know why you
want to make this film?

06:15.132 --> 06:17.802
Because, these are real people,

06:17.834 --> 06:19.870
but we treat them
like they're invisible.

06:22.839 --> 06:24.407
I know what that feels like.

06:26.910 --> 06:30.248
This... this doesn't
show me that.

06:36.286 --> 06:39.589
If I don't have a finished film,
a good finished film,

06:39.622 --> 06:42.894
in my hands by the time I start
the screening on Friday...

06:47.430 --> 06:48.800
you don't graduate.

07:07.184 --> 07:09.420
<i>Is this
what failure looks like?</i>

07:13.023 --> 07:15.860
<i>I'm learning the grass
isn't always greener,</i>

07:17.394 --> 07:19.062
<i>especially in Hollywood.</i>

07:23.399 --> 07:24.935
<i>Do I have what it takes?</i>

07:26.403 --> 07:28.906
<i>I don't even have a place
to sleep tonight.</i>

07:38.649 --> 07:41.018
<i>They say,
"Write what you know,"</i>

07:41.050 --> 07:43.887
<i>only problem is,
I don't know shit.</i>

08:09.478 --> 08:10.647
Fuck!

08:16.253 --> 08:17.321
Fuck!

08:49.785 --> 08:51.121
Yo.

08:51.687 --> 08:53.090
Hey.

08:57.527 --> 08:58.996
That your new stuff?

08:59.629 --> 09:00.965
Yup.

09:03.033 --> 09:04.402
Looks pretty hot.

09:05.668 --> 09:07.038
Thanks.

09:08.371 --> 09:10.274
Don't get a big head
or anything.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.535
<i>I swear, Travis,</i>

10:12.568 --> 10:16.105
<i>you'd have lost your head
by now if it wasn't attached.</i>

10:16.139 --> 10:18.142
I'll get a new phone
once I get home.

10:18.774 --> 10:20.376
<i>Just be careful driving.</i>

10:20.409 --> 10:22.212
<i>Did you finish
your project yet?</i>

10:25.816 --> 10:27.317
Yeah, it's all done.

10:27.350 --> 10:30.320
<i>You know I wish I could
be there to see your movie.</i>

10:30.352 --> 10:32.923
<i>I told you I would
put you through college.</i>

10:32.956 --> 10:34.758
<i>Even though
what you got a degree in</i>

10:34.791 --> 10:36.360
<i>wasn't my first choice,</i>

10:36.393 --> 10:39.696
<i>I know you're gonna do
something special one day.</i>

10:39.729 --> 10:41.198
<i>I've got your room all ready.</i>

10:41.230 --> 10:43.133
<i>Don't do too much.</i>

10:43.166 --> 10:45.269
<i>I don't even know
how long I'll be staying.</i>

10:45.302 --> 10:47.604
<i>You're always
in a rush, Travis.</i>

10:47.636 --> 10:49.272
<i>But where are you going?</i>

10:53.176 --> 10:54.645
<i>Good question.</i>

10:55.511 --> 10:57.113
<i>Why am I leaving?</i>

10:58.447 --> 10:59.616
<i>I love LA.</i>

11:04.019 --> 11:08.058
<i>In a city of millions,
I found Kristen.</i>

11:09.259 --> 11:11.829
<i>I don't even know how
to tell her I'm going home.</i>

11:17.433 --> 11:21.704
<i>I read in the '50s,
the air was so polluted,</i>

11:21.738 --> 11:24.508
<i>people had to wear gas masks
walking through downtown.</i>

11:26.676 --> 11:27.610
<i>That's fucked up.</i>

11:29.278 --> 11:31.081
<i>You know what's
even more fucked up?</i>

11:32.481 --> 11:33.884
<i>In the '40s,</i>

11:33.917 --> 11:37.019
<i>95% of Los Angeles
was off-limits</i>

11:37.052 --> 11:38.822
<i>to Blacks and Asians
to live in.</i>

11:40.590 --> 11:43.127
And you wonder why
it is like it is now.

11:47.029 --> 11:49.198
Before my parents died,

11:49.231 --> 11:51.434
I asked them
why they moved here.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.803
What'd they say?

11:55.138 --> 11:57.173
They didn't have an answer.

11:57.206 --> 12:00.577
Said my brother Bobby and I
would understand some day.

12:01.912 --> 12:03.379
What do you think now?

12:04.514 --> 12:09.153
I think that maybe
they'd still be alive

12:09.186 --> 12:11.155
if they'd never moved here,

12:11.187 --> 12:13.323
but my life would be
completely different.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.397
What about you,
you got any fam out here?

12:22.198 --> 12:23.867
My uncle, somewhere.

12:24.934 --> 12:27.036
Never really met him, though.

12:27.070 --> 12:29.473
He and my mom
had a beef for some shit.

12:31.140 --> 12:32.575
Let me see your phone.

12:43.052 --> 12:44.388
That's him.

12:46.655 --> 12:49.192
My mom said once
he had so much money,

12:49.225 --> 12:50.693
it all went to his head.

12:52.162 --> 12:55.132
Think she was just mad
'cause we were struggling.

12:55.164 --> 12:56.799
Maybe you should
reach out to him.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.569
He'd be happy to see you.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.506
I doubt it.

13:32.101 --> 13:33.269
I can teach you.

13:33.302 --> 13:34.571
I'm a pretty...

13:34.604 --> 13:36.307
- What's wrong?
- What the fuck?

13:36.773 --> 13:37.908
Where's my car?

13:42.678 --> 13:43.746
Fuck.

13:43.779 --> 13:44.981
Damn, man.

13:46.515 --> 13:48.651
My car got towed,
everything was in there.

13:49.152 --> 13:50.621
Fuck, I'm so stupid.

13:50.653 --> 13:51.955
- Okay.
- Damn.

13:55.591 --> 13:57.693
My hard drive, my computer.

13:57.726 --> 13:58.828
<i>Fuck.</i>

14:00.964 --> 14:03.200
<i>What about that uncle?</i>

14:03.232 --> 14:05.401
- Robin Reynolds.
- Wait, no, don't. Please.

14:07.437 --> 14:08.972
I think this is him.

14:09.739 --> 14:11.542
<i>3033 Crest Hill Drive.</i>

16:09.759 --> 16:10.793
Can I help you?

16:14.831 --> 16:16.800
Carolyn Wolfe.

16:21.804 --> 16:22.839
What about her?

16:24.374 --> 16:25.576
I'm her son.

16:28.677 --> 16:29.679
Travis?

16:48.064 --> 16:49.566
Last time I saw you,

16:52.535 --> 16:55.172
you must have been this tall.

16:58.273 --> 17:00.643
<i>Hey, buddy,
excited about our meeting.</i>

17:00.676 --> 17:02.711
<i>Don't hesitate to bring
me any and every idea</i>

17:02.744 --> 17:04.146
<i>you've got in that brilliant...</i>

17:07.217 --> 17:08.152
Are you married?

17:10.086 --> 17:11.121
Nope.

17:13.556 --> 17:14.724
Kids or anything?

17:16.358 --> 17:18.127
Just me, myself, and I.

17:22.198 --> 17:23.066
That's cool.

17:24.366 --> 17:26.470
What has your mother
told you about me?

17:28.704 --> 17:29.905
Not much.

17:29.939 --> 17:32.142
I know you guys haven't
talked in a while.

17:32.474 --> 17:33.543
That's it?

17:34.943 --> 17:37.146
She mentioned you
worked in Hollywood.

17:37.946 --> 17:38.815
Made a lot money.

17:40.282 --> 17:42.652
I produced a few TV shows.

17:44.686 --> 17:46.189
Looks like you did okay.

17:48.958 --> 17:51.228
Industry ain't
like it used to be.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.200
I got lucky.

17:57.099 --> 17:58.836
Product of my time.

17:59.935 --> 18:02.338
There was a day when
just being a Black man

18:02.372 --> 18:03.473
with a good head
on your shoulders

18:03.506 --> 18:05.476
could get you
somewhere in this town.

18:26.162 --> 18:28.498
What are you out here chasing?

18:28.530 --> 18:31.134
You, uh, a singer or something?

18:32.134 --> 18:34.738
I'm actually about to
graduate film school.

18:35.238 --> 18:37.274
Congratulations.

18:37.307 --> 18:39.976
Joining the rest of the people
with meaningless degrees,

18:40.009 --> 18:43.180
searching for meaningless
answers to meaningless questions.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.316
Least we can do is try, right?

18:46.348 --> 18:47.783
Yeah, I used to think like you,

18:47.817 --> 18:49.553
and then I got my
first residual check.

18:54.190 --> 18:56.259
How about we have a drink?

18:56.291 --> 18:59.695
To you... completing something
you set out to do.

18:59.729 --> 19:02.266
I mean, that's got to be
worth celebrating, right?

19:03.700 --> 19:06.569
I mean, I have to finish my
film before I can graduate.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.306
Oh, close enough.

19:28.324 --> 19:29.225
Fuck.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.798
That is a dirty martini
you're drinking,

19:34.830 --> 19:37.667
and I make the meanest
one this side of the 405.

19:38.634 --> 19:40.804
Sorry, I'm not
much of a drinker.

19:53.182 --> 19:54.183
Damn.

19:56.118 --> 19:57.253
You look just like him.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.155
Who?

20:02.258 --> 20:03.360
Your father.

20:05.394 --> 20:06.997
I heard that my whole life.

20:13.001 --> 20:15.305
You know, I introduced
your pops to Carolyn.

20:16.838 --> 20:18.808
She never really
talks about him.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.613
She seems... scarred.

20:24.113 --> 20:27.150
She said that sometimes
people have a sickness

20:27.750 --> 20:28.817
that they can't get rid of

20:28.851 --> 20:30.621
no matter how hard they try.

20:32.154 --> 20:37.626
You know, this family
reunion has been really nice,

20:37.660 --> 20:40.730
but, um, it's not a good time.

20:40.762 --> 20:42.665
I'm pulling together
some projects

20:42.699 --> 20:45.402
for a big meeting
that I have next week.

20:45.434 --> 20:48.070
So why don't I just see you out

20:48.104 --> 20:50.173
and maybe the two of us,
we can get together...

20:50.205 --> 20:52.007
My car got towed...

20:52.040 --> 20:53.842
and I had a lot of
important shit in there.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.913
I know it sounds crazy, but
I'm a little short on cash...

20:57.913 --> 21:00.115
I just need, like, $500.

21:00.148 --> 21:01.217
I can pay you back.

21:01.817 --> 21:02.985
I promise, man.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.093
Man, fuck it.

21:14.262 --> 21:15.231
500.

21:20.903 --> 21:22.538
Thank you,
I promise I'll pay you back.

21:22.571 --> 21:23.739
Yeah.

21:23.772 --> 21:24.874
Good luck, Travis.

21:24.906 --> 21:26.409
Maybe we could, um...

21:28.243 --> 21:29.111
Okay.

21:35.651 --> 21:36.619
You got that?

21:36.652 --> 21:37.721
Yeah.

21:38.386 --> 21:39.255
Hungry.

21:39.821 --> 21:40.890
Yeah, me too.

21:43.392 --> 21:47.197
You know, today is Mom and Dad's
anniversary of moving here.

21:50.365 --> 21:54.604
One of these days,
I'm gonna buy that place back.

21:54.636 --> 21:56.338
It still reminds me of them.

21:57.405 --> 21:59.174
Omma behind the counter.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.511
Umpa stocking the aisles
with Pepero

22:01.544 --> 22:03.278
and Melona bars.

22:03.311 --> 22:05.048
Playing hide and seek
in the back.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.182
I'd always found you
near the Pixy Stix.

22:09.085 --> 22:10.086
Oh, it's open.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.020
Are you nuts?

22:12.054 --> 22:13.857
You know what I have in there.

22:14.856 --> 22:17.326
I don't want to
have to live like you.

22:19.362 --> 22:21.098
Why do you do this shit?

22:22.330 --> 22:23.899
What am I supposed to do?

22:24.967 --> 22:26.503
Life didn't give us anything.

22:27.970 --> 22:30.140
You're gonna get
yourself killed...

22:32.508 --> 22:33.809
or the both of us.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.983
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.753
This is your life.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.461
We don't always get to choose.

25:17.906 --> 25:19.174
Can't believe
you got her number.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.076
She's definitely the
hottest chick in there, right?

25:21.109 --> 25:23.278
Yeah, how'd you trick her
with those shitty dance moves?

25:23.311 --> 25:24.179
Oh, this one?

25:27.415 --> 25:29.985
Everything eventually
runs its course, boys.

25:30.519 --> 25:31.453
I'm saying, my man...

25:31.487 --> 25:33.957
film was the art form
of the 20th century.

25:34.990 --> 25:36.358
I don't even know what's next.

25:36.392 --> 25:38.861
VR, AR, holograms.

25:38.894 --> 25:40.262
Just bring on that
virtual pussy, man.

25:40.296 --> 25:42.532
You would be into that,
you sick fuck.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.436
We're losing the essential,
though, man.

25:46.469 --> 25:47.836
The essential what, dude?

25:47.869 --> 25:50.405
It's telling a story, bro,
there's a million ways you can do that.

25:50.439 --> 25:53.643
All that other stuff is
speaking a different language.

25:53.675 --> 25:55.912
Movies, cinema, whatever
the fuck you want to call it,

25:55.944 --> 25:57.947
that has its own way
of communicating.

25:58.713 --> 26:00.182
What do you know, anyway?

26:00.215 --> 26:02.384
You're gonna work at some
big time studio, huh?

26:03.551 --> 26:06.054
Okay, first off, my dad
got me this job, all right?

26:06.087 --> 26:07.990
And he pulled some pretty
big favors to do so.

26:08.023 --> 26:09.758
Look, I'm not trying to be
an asshole over here.

26:09.791 --> 26:11.059
Yeah, at least
you'll be a paid one.

26:11.093 --> 26:12.595
Oh, yeah, that's funny.

26:12.627 --> 26:13.795
You guys think I'm psyched

26:13.828 --> 26:15.498
about waking up at
7:00 a.m. every day?

26:15.530 --> 26:16.499
Sellout.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.400
Okay, yeah, you guys
want to shit on me now?

26:18.433 --> 26:20.903
When you guys are done
being "starving artists,"

26:20.935 --> 26:21.903
come holla at me.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.374
Cinema is a reflection.

26:24.406 --> 26:25.875
I mean, there's
no other art form

26:25.907 --> 26:28.176
in which we can see
so much of ourselves.

26:28.210 --> 26:30.413
Hey, speaking of,
what's up with your film?

26:30.445 --> 26:31.347
Still editing.

26:31.814 --> 26:32.682
Damn, bro.

26:33.182 --> 26:34.884
You're not done yet?

26:34.916 --> 26:36.718
You know the screening's
Friday, right?

26:36.751 --> 26:38.887
Yeah, I heard Baker flunked,
like, three people last year

26:38.921 --> 26:40.222
who didn't finish on time.

26:40.256 --> 26:41.291
Oh.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.601
Oh, I think I definitely
pulled a hammy back there.

26:52.634 --> 26:53.635
Jeez Louise.

26:55.604 --> 26:56.572
Let's get an Uber.

26:56.605 --> 26:58.307
Done.

26:58.339 --> 27:00.175
Man, you think I can stay
over your place tonight?

27:00.209 --> 27:03.046
I mean, I'll be super quiet.
I just need a place to work.

27:05.181 --> 27:06.750
Uh, I would, normally, um...

27:08.851 --> 27:12.155
But, you know, my new roommate's
kind of a dick right now.

27:12.188 --> 27:15.258
It's just not a good night,
you know?

27:16.692 --> 27:18.060
Ooh, that's us, baby.

27:18.394 --> 27:19.095
All right.

27:19.127 --> 27:20.362
Yo, later, dude.

27:22.798 --> 27:23.732
For you, beautiful.

27:33.576 --> 27:35.478
<i>Reflections?</i>

27:35.510 --> 27:36.613
<i>Fuck reflections.</i>

27:37.278 --> 27:38.647
<i>I've wasted too much time.</i>

27:39.981 --> 27:42.518
<i>Fear sucks.</i>

27:42.550 --> 27:45.187
<i>Being afraid,
what did it get me?</i>

27:56.198 --> 27:59.736
<i>Had six months,
now I got five days.</i>

28:20.221 --> 28:23.091
<i>Oh,
here comes trouble.</i>

28:24.292 --> 28:25.694
<i>Good to see you,
good to see you.</i>

28:25.728 --> 28:27.196
<i>Good to see you too, brother.
Come on up.</i>

28:27.229 --> 28:28.465
<i>What is this, new paint?</i>

28:30.199 --> 28:32.634
What can I get you,
you want some coffee or...

28:32.667 --> 28:33.902
Come on, man.

28:33.935 --> 28:35.337
What am I, a soccer mom?

28:35.371 --> 28:37.105
All right, I've got
the perfect thing for you.

28:37.138 --> 28:38.173
I've got the perfect
thing for you.

28:38.207 --> 28:40.042
My uncle just sent this to me.

28:40.075 --> 28:41.644
- Ah.
- It is amazing.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.044
It's an old family recipe.

28:43.077 --> 28:45.682
Straight from Uncle Art.

28:47.148 --> 28:48.383
- Uncle Art.
- Uncle Art.

28:48.416 --> 28:50.686
To a hit, man,
to a fucking hit.

28:51.854 --> 28:53.722
So listen, I am really glad

28:53.756 --> 28:56.092
that we could have
this sit down together

28:56.125 --> 28:58.394
because I was
reviewing your account

28:58.426 --> 29:02.964
and there's not a lot of money
to move around, my friend.

29:02.998 --> 29:07.870
So we need to get you into
something that's gonna be solid

29:07.903 --> 29:10.239
and that's gonna be a rainmaking

29:10.271 --> 29:13.141
proposition for you,
for a while.

29:13.174 --> 29:14.242
What are you trying to say?

29:14.276 --> 29:16.312
We've known each
other for 20 years.

29:16.345 --> 29:21.116
I am a serious producer,
a serious writer.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.886
It's so different then
when <i>Daddy Oh</i> was around.

29:23.919 --> 29:25.388
I don't care where you find it,

29:25.421 --> 29:29.592
I don't care who you find it
with, you need a fucking hit.

29:29.625 --> 29:32.827
You need hit that appeals
to today's market,

29:32.861 --> 29:34.430
to today's young people.

29:34.462 --> 29:36.932
You need something that's
gonna cause a sensation,

29:36.965 --> 29:38.567
you need, like,
the hashtags to be

29:38.601 --> 29:40.636
- going nuts over your work.
- Oh, my God.

29:40.669 --> 29:43.172
You're talking to me
about fucking hashtags?

29:43.204 --> 29:46.509
Yeah, I am.
Hashtag, you're broke.

29:46.541 --> 29:49.211
You need a hit,
and you need a hit now.

29:49.244 --> 29:51.947
I get it, Wallace.

29:53.848 --> 29:55.717
I get it.

31:26.075 --> 31:28.611
Yo, where you going
in such a hurry?

31:28.644 --> 31:32.114
I'm gonna meet
Sophia for lunch, so.

31:32.146 --> 31:34.250
Hey, thanks for cleaning up
the place.

31:34.282 --> 31:35.684
Looks nice.

31:35.718 --> 31:37.452
No worries.

32:24.866 --> 32:27.369
If you can have
a conversation with anybody,

32:27.403 --> 32:29.338
who would it be?

32:31.240 --> 32:32.407
Anybody?

32:32.441 --> 32:35.510
Yeah, doesn't matter
if they're alive or dead.

32:38.747 --> 32:41.016
My dad.

32:41.048 --> 32:44.354
I'd ask him why I wasn't enough
to stick around.

32:45.820 --> 32:48.690
All I ever wanted to do
was make him proud.

32:51.894 --> 32:54.697
I'm sure he'd be so proud
of you right now.

32:56.731 --> 32:59.601
What about you?
Who'd you talk to?

33:00.969 --> 33:03.038
Myself in ten years.

33:04.506 --> 33:05.975
I'd ask how I got here.

33:06.008 --> 33:12.280
How I became this famous
and successful designer.

33:16.018 --> 33:18.988
You know what? I believe it.

33:25.359 --> 33:27.195
Whoa.

33:27.229 --> 33:29.331
This post got, like,
12,000 likes

33:29.364 --> 33:30.466
since I last checked.

33:30.499 --> 33:33.536
See,
you're already famous.

33:43.144 --> 33:46.648
You should come through
to the rooftop tomorrow night.

33:46.682 --> 33:47.682
For sure.

33:51.252 --> 33:53.655
Um, I'll
see you later, yeah?

33:53.688 --> 33:55.056
Yeah.

34:03.798 --> 34:05.668
Hey, your little sis got
a thing for dark meat, huh?

34:05.701 --> 34:08.137
Shut the fuck up, man.

34:15.110 --> 34:16.445
Hey. Hey!

34:16.478 --> 34:18.313
Yo, who was that?

34:18.347 --> 34:19.782
None of your fucking business.

34:19.815 --> 34:22.150
Don't disrespect me
like that, huh?

34:22.184 --> 34:24.652
I'm the one that's putting
a roof over your head.

34:24.686 --> 34:27.123
You think I need you?

34:30.224 --> 34:32.393
Omma and Umpa
would be so ashamed

34:32.427 --> 34:33.695
to know what you're doing
right now.

34:33.728 --> 34:35.431
I'm doing what
we need to get by,

34:35.463 --> 34:37.632
and they would understand that.

34:37.666 --> 34:39.467
That includes protecting you
and this place.

34:39.501 --> 34:42.038
You know, I'm not gonna
caught slipping like them.

34:51.512 --> 34:53.748
I don't got time for this shit.

35:47.768 --> 35:49.404
Think you can handle this?

35:49.438 --> 35:51.407
I got you.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.775
- You sure?
- Yeah.

35:58.713 --> 36:00.715
Better have my fucking money
next week.

36:32.447 --> 36:33.615
What do you think?

36:33.648 --> 36:36.518
I think
you're wasting my time.

36:36.550 --> 36:39.121
If this is a joke,
I'm not laughing.

36:43.190 --> 36:44.726
You told me your mother,

36:44.760 --> 36:46.795
she made some major sacrifices
for you to be here.

36:46.827 --> 36:49.431
What is she gonna think
if you don't graduate?

36:49.463 --> 36:51.400
That's not really an option.

36:51.432 --> 36:53.835
Well, it's gonna take
more than this.

36:56.804 --> 36:59.140
- Who else has seen this?
- Just you.

37:00.474 --> 37:02.478
You don't have anybody
who can give you

37:02.510 --> 37:04.313
some honest feedback?

37:13.655 --> 37:16.925
<i>Never give up your passion,</i>

37:16.958 --> 37:19.894
- <i>passion what makes the man.</i>
- Okay.

37:19.927 --> 37:22.097
All right, I've...
I've seen enough.

37:25.567 --> 37:29.170
Why is it all grainy like that?

37:29.204 --> 37:32.074
I like the aesthetic.

37:32.106 --> 37:33.909
It's not a good one.

37:40.748 --> 37:42.851
You're hitting it kinda hard.

37:44.786 --> 37:47.423
Oh, so because I judged you,
you want to judge me now.

37:47.456 --> 37:48.757
Look, I'm just saying.

37:48.789 --> 37:52.795
No, you're not saying anything,
that's the problem.

37:52.827 --> 37:54.195
What didn't you like about it?

37:54.228 --> 37:56.164
What didn't I like
about it?

37:56.197 --> 37:57.498
The whole thing.

37:57.532 --> 37:59.501
I mean, I... I moved
to Beverly Hills

37:59.534 --> 38:01.003
to get away from trash
like that.

38:01.036 --> 38:02.471
You think you're better
than them?

38:02.503 --> 38:04.139
I didn't get here by accident.

38:04.172 --> 38:04.873
I worked hard work,

38:04.905 --> 38:06.240
and made sacrifice,

38:06.273 --> 38:08.342
something you probably wouldn't
know a damn thing about.

38:08.376 --> 38:09.611
You don't know anything about me

38:09.643 --> 38:11.746
or what I've been through.

38:19.387 --> 38:22.291
What I do know...

38:22.324 --> 38:26.028
is that this is
a dog-eat-dog business.

38:26.061 --> 38:28.530
Ain't nobody gonna
give you anything.

38:28.563 --> 38:31.800
And ain't nobody got time
for amateur hour.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.670
You need to polish this up

38:34.702 --> 38:37.306
and get thicker skin.

38:37.338 --> 38:40.174
And you look like you could use
a good night's sleep.

38:40.208 --> 38:44.346
I got a spare bedroom upstairs,
you're welcome to stay.

38:47.382 --> 38:48.650
I got some friends coming by

38:48.682 --> 38:51.286
later on this evening,
for a little party.

38:53.822 --> 38:56.025
I'm sure they'd get
a kick out of meeting my nephew.

39:01.195 --> 39:05.500
As you can see, we've got
someone joining us this evening,

39:05.534 --> 39:07.869
and it's a very special someone.

39:08.936 --> 39:10.972
This is my nephew, Travis.

39:12.673 --> 39:15.210
Hey, Travis.

39:15.242 --> 39:17.211
- How special!
- Nephew.

39:17.244 --> 39:19.114
Travis is a filmmaker,

39:19.146 --> 39:21.682
and he's about to graduate
from college.

39:21.715 --> 39:23.585
- Good for you.
- Wow.

39:23.617 --> 39:25.186
What type of movies do you do?

39:25.219 --> 39:26.554
Uh, documentaries.

39:26.588 --> 39:29.591
Oh, you're in the... you're
in the right space, buddy.

39:29.623 --> 39:31.058
It's really hot right now.

39:31.092 --> 39:33.262
What's your subject matter? What are you...

39:33.295 --> 39:36.063
So the first one that I'm working on
now is about the homeless community.

39:36.097 --> 39:40.369
Oh, that's... that's amazing,
no ever talks about that

39:40.402 --> 39:43.371
and it's happening
all around us. That's cool.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.641
Let's all raise a glass.

39:45.673 --> 39:47.376
- Absolutely.
- To Travis.

39:47.409 --> 39:49.611
- Yes, to Travis.
- To my nephew, Travis.

39:49.643 --> 39:52.180
Thank you.

39:52.213 --> 39:53.581
Thank you.

39:53.614 --> 39:55.317
- Yeah, well done.
- Cheers.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.719
Congrats, man.

39:59.054 --> 40:00.822
So what's
going on with your love life?

40:03.023 --> 40:04.393
- That is a good question.
- Yeah.

40:04.425 --> 40:07.596
We have not heard about
for quite some time.

40:07.628 --> 40:09.664
There's nothing to tell.

40:09.697 --> 40:13.100
- Back me up.
- Like, it's time to date, time to date,

40:13.134 --> 40:15.137
time to date, time to date.

40:15.170 --> 40:16.605
I need a refill, anyone else?

40:16.637 --> 40:18.472
- Yeah, he needs a refill now.
- No, you don't.

40:18.505 --> 40:21.409
Oh, now he needs a refill.

40:21.443 --> 40:23.345
Uh-huh, as soon
as we start talking about...

40:23.378 --> 40:25.914
Goodbye, Mr. Refill, goodbye.

40:25.947 --> 40:27.816
I can't believe he...

40:27.849 --> 40:30.652
Did I piss him off?
He's not still sensitive

40:30.684 --> 40:32.587
about that, is he?

40:32.621 --> 40:35.123
It's so long since Henrietta.

40:35.155 --> 40:37.192
So how close are
you to your uncle?

40:37.224 --> 40:39.427
You guys are pretty
close, right?

40:40.295 --> 40:43.932
Uh, we actually
just reconnected.

40:43.965 --> 40:45.434
- Really?
- Oh, you're kidding.

40:45.467 --> 40:47.135
- Yeah.
- How long ago?

40:48.003 --> 40:49.838
Uh, couple of days.

40:49.871 --> 40:53.108
Does your mom know
that you're visiting your uncle?

40:53.141 --> 40:55.309
'Cause he never
talks about her.

40:55.342 --> 40:57.211
I didn't even know
that he had a sister

40:57.244 --> 40:59.914
- until a few years ago.
- Or a nephew.

40:59.947 --> 41:02.384
But we love to meet you.

41:08.690 --> 41:10.592
Your friends are pretty cool.

41:10.625 --> 41:11.960
Good people.

41:11.992 --> 41:14.962
That can be hard to
come by in this city.

41:14.996 --> 41:16.898
When was the last time
you went back home?

41:18.599 --> 41:21.036
Twenty years.

41:21.068 --> 41:23.639
That must have been
around the time my dad died.

41:24.706 --> 41:26.307
It was.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.809
At this point, that place
is more in the vicinity

41:28.842 --> 41:31.646
of my imagination
than an actual memory.

41:35.115 --> 41:38.019
But I do remember
one thing, though.

41:39.753 --> 41:41.989
You didn't talk much.

41:42.023 --> 41:44.259
But you loved ice cream.

41:44.291 --> 41:46.929
Didn't matter the flavor.

41:46.961 --> 41:48.896
That's all you would
eat for a while.

41:48.929 --> 41:51.299
Memory is a funny thing.

41:52.867 --> 41:55.170
You remember anything
about your father?

41:56.036 --> 41:59.073
- Uh-uh.
- He was a good guy.

42:00.407 --> 42:03.311
Real cool.

42:03.344 --> 42:05.680
No sense at all
when it came to mathematics

42:05.713 --> 42:07.583
or books or anything like that,

42:08.849 --> 42:12.086
but you put a paintbrush
in is hand...

42:12.119 --> 42:15.356
he could make magic.

42:16.690 --> 42:18.559
Like what?

42:18.592 --> 42:22.096
Not really people too much.

42:22.130 --> 42:26.168
He was always painting
his own universe.

42:28.536 --> 42:30.539
What happened to them?

42:32.106 --> 42:35.009
Your mother,
she burned them all.

42:38.179 --> 42:40.581
Why would she do that?

42:40.614 --> 42:45.086
It's not easy to go through
what she did.

42:46.554 --> 42:48.856
People are capable
of all sorts of things

42:48.889 --> 42:51.626
under the right circumstances.

42:57.498 --> 43:02.036
Hey, I want
to show you something.

43:15.416 --> 43:17.152
Your father gave this
to me the day I left

43:17.184 --> 43:19.020
to come to California.

43:19.054 --> 43:22.557
Your mother never got her hands
on this one.

43:50.918 --> 43:52.920
It's like...

43:52.954 --> 43:56.258
everything about him was erased,

43:57.291 --> 44:00.094
wiped away
like he was never there.

44:42.036 --> 44:43.271
Looking for something?

44:45.572 --> 44:47.708
I see you got
the nosiness of your mother.

44:47.742 --> 44:51.113
Sorry,
I didn't mean to go through your stuff.

44:53.481 --> 44:55.851
- What time is it?
- It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

44:56.416 --> 44:57.385
Oh, shit.

44:59.019 --> 45:00.788
Thank you for letting me
crash here last night.

45:02.090 --> 45:03.392
It was nice having you here.

45:06.894 --> 45:08.329
Think I can leave
my computer here?

45:10.664 --> 45:13.434
I'm going downtown and
it's kinda sketchy.

45:13.467 --> 45:15.837
I don't want anything to happen
to my film before I finish it.

45:18.672 --> 45:20.208
The key is in the lockbox.

45:20.742 --> 45:23.245
The code is 2870.

45:23.277 --> 45:26.647
- Got it.
- Make sure you put it back.

45:26.681 --> 45:27.749
No problem.

45:29.918 --> 45:31.553
Guess I'll see you later.

45:31.585 --> 45:32.687
Sure thing, nephew.

45:34.054 --> 45:35.356
Keep working.

45:35.923 --> 45:37.125
What?

45:37.157 --> 45:38.426
On your film.

45:38.992 --> 45:40.594
You got something there,

45:40.628 --> 45:42.631
but you have to bring
the heart out of it.

45:44.032 --> 45:45.267
Gotcha.

46:20.702 --> 46:22.237
Speaking of
being all about that,

46:22.269 --> 46:23.538
you haven't even
brought up the girl.

46:23.570 --> 46:25.172
Well, you
know, I'm a gentleman.

46:25.206 --> 46:26.807
- Uh-huh.
- She's very cool, seriously.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.143
- I think I'm gonna hang out...
- Hey.

46:28.175 --> 46:29.543
- Bullshit.
- Yo, what's up?

46:29.577 --> 46:31.112
- Hey.
- Yo, there he is.

46:31.144 --> 46:32.813
You missed the
bruncheon, dude.

46:32.847 --> 46:34.216
Was Baker pissed?

46:34.248 --> 46:37.284
Oh, I don't know, not any more
than he usually is, the sad fuck.

46:37.318 --> 46:38.386
Yeah, but don't sweat,
though.

46:38.418 --> 46:39.587
It's not like you
did the film, anyway,

46:39.621 --> 46:40.689
so technically you
don't have to be

46:40.722 --> 46:43.258
- at the "graduation luncheon."
- Oh, burn!

46:43.291 --> 46:44.426
Look, I'll get it done.

46:44.458 --> 46:45.826
- All right.
- Yeah, you will.

46:45.860 --> 46:47.596
Let's fucking celebrate,
huh, what do you say?

46:47.628 --> 46:49.730
Whoo, whoo! A.J.: You know
I'm just kidding with you, right?

46:49.764 --> 46:50.999
Get it.

47:47.121 --> 47:48.389
Okay.

47:48.422 --> 47:49.556
- So, so, so, so, so?
- Spit it out.

47:49.590 --> 47:52.559
Oh, my gosh, I just
got the most amazing DM.

47:52.592 --> 47:53.394
Huh?

47:53.427 --> 47:54.663
- From who?
- I'm going to New York.

47:54.695 --> 47:56.730
- Oh, my God.
- Or I may go to New York, maybe.

47:56.764 --> 47:58.800
- What?
- This designer wants me to work for him.

47:58.833 --> 48:00.035
Wait, wait, back up.

48:00.068 --> 48:02.103
"Maybe"? But "maybe"?

48:02.135 --> 48:04.605
Yeah, I don't know if
I want to go yet.

48:04.639 --> 48:07.008
- There's so much going on here.
- That is fucking amazing.

48:07.041 --> 48:08.143
You have to go.

48:08.175 --> 48:09.244
- I don't know.
- Right?

48:09.277 --> 48:10.378
You're gonna go.

48:10.411 --> 48:12.146
She's gonna go.
We're gonna visit her.

48:12.179 --> 48:13.847
We're gonna visit her.
We're gonna go.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.518
- You're gonna...
- I am freaking on top of the world right now.

48:16.550 --> 48:18.485
Oh, my God.

48:18.518 --> 48:19.820
Did you tell Travis?

48:20.755 --> 48:21.890
Tell me what?

48:21.922 --> 48:23.090
Hi!

48:23.123 --> 48:24.326
What's going on?

48:26.360 --> 48:28.063
Let's go over there,
I have something to tell you.

48:36.269 --> 48:38.873
- I got an email today.
- What?

48:38.905 --> 48:40.041
Some designer saw my stuff

48:40.074 --> 48:42.311
and he wants me to come
work for him in New York.

48:42.643 --> 48:43.411
What?

48:43.443 --> 48:45.079
- I know.
- That's dope.

48:45.112 --> 48:46.380
Thank you.

48:47.748 --> 48:53.487
I was thinking
that you can come with me.

48:53.521 --> 48:56.725
You make films and
I make clothes...

48:58.492 --> 49:01.628
You want me to move
to New York with you?

49:01.661 --> 49:03.597
I mean, what's your
plan for the future?

49:04.030 --> 49:04.932
For us?

49:07.268 --> 49:08.503
I haven't really
thought about it.

49:08.536 --> 49:10.304
I mean, so much
has been happening.

49:10.338 --> 49:12.641
I got to focus on myself,
not you.

49:15.275 --> 49:16.411
Hey, hey.

49:30.324 --> 49:31.827
I didn't mean what
I said earlier.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.928
Yes, you did.

49:37.565 --> 49:39.835
If there's anything I care
about right now...

49:41.101 --> 49:42.036
it's you.

49:44.271 --> 49:47.107
You got to let someone
into your universe,

49:47.141 --> 49:50.778
or else you'll
just be all alone.

50:11.932 --> 50:13.034
Yo, lover boy.

50:14.402 --> 50:15.470
I'm talking to you.

50:22.909 --> 50:24.678
Did you have a good
time with my sister?

50:27.347 --> 50:28.750
I'm gonna be very clear.

50:30.518 --> 50:31.786
Stay away from her.

50:33.019 --> 50:34.088
I don't ask twice.

50:34.688 --> 50:36.356
What do you want from me?

50:36.389 --> 50:39.226
- I want you to leave and never come back.
- Why?

50:39.260 --> 50:40.528
You don't even know me.

50:40.561 --> 50:42.998
I know a kid like
you killed my parents.

50:44.030 --> 50:46.934
Walked into their store
and shot them.

50:49.269 --> 50:51.972
And I know they
never hurt anybody.

50:52.005 --> 50:55.911
So if you come back here
again, I'm gonna hurt you.

50:58.144 --> 50:59.181
You understand?

51:03.184 --> 51:04.219
Keep walking.

51:27.574 --> 51:29.043
<i>I fucked up
with Kristen,</i>

51:30.177 --> 51:31.646
<i>can't fuck up this film.</i>

51:33.047 --> 51:34.249
<i>I'm way too close.</i>

51:35.215 --> 51:36.750
<i>No more distractions.</i>

51:56.971 --> 52:00.942
<i>I have to finish this,
find the truth.</i>

52:02.043 --> 52:06.581
<i>Like my dad, I got to
make my own universe.</i>

52:13.920 --> 52:14.955
Oh, shit.

52:14.989 --> 52:17.826
Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

52:18.291 --> 52:19.527
It's okay.

52:21.228 --> 52:22.597
I finished my film.

52:22.630 --> 52:24.898
That's wonderful.

52:24.931 --> 52:27.034
And I really appreciate
you letting me crash here.

52:27.467 --> 52:28.670
Helped a lot.

52:28.702 --> 52:30.572
Well, I'm really glad
I could help.

52:32.672 --> 52:35.309
You should come
to my screening.

52:35.342 --> 52:36.577
Most people have
their family there,

52:36.610 --> 52:38.279
but my mom couldn't make it.

52:40.715 --> 52:43.785
Yeah, um...
I'll check my schedule,

52:43.818 --> 52:46.621
but I really can't
promise anything.

52:49.523 --> 52:52.193
But hey, I got
something to celebrate.

52:53.628 --> 52:54.896
I think you'll dig it.

53:05.438 --> 53:07.274
Once, I knew these two people.

53:08.509 --> 53:09.677
What people?

53:12.012 --> 53:14.715
These people, they were
in love with each other.

53:16.684 --> 53:18.086
Both about the same age.

53:19.186 --> 53:20.322
Close to your age now.

53:23.123 --> 53:27.628
One of them was
wild and reckless.

53:29.597 --> 53:32.801
The other one was
more sensitive, shy.

53:35.869 --> 53:37.170
Most of the time
they spent together,

53:37.204 --> 53:41.276
it was just doing
ordinary regular stuff,

53:43.744 --> 53:44.946
but it always felt like

53:44.978 --> 53:47.081
it was the most important
thing in the world.

53:49.483 --> 53:51.086
Sounds like they were happy.

53:52.085 --> 53:53.420
They were.

53:53.454 --> 53:54.823
They were really happy.

54:04.798 --> 54:06.134
<i>What is happiness?</i>

54:07.902 --> 54:09.304
<i>I came here to find it.</i>

54:15.876 --> 54:19.814
<i>Los Angeles, endless city.</i>

54:19.847 --> 54:24.786
<i>I barely made a dent
until I met this girl</i>

54:24.818 --> 54:27.021
<i>and realized she
was all I needed.</i>

54:30.224 --> 54:32.661
<i>I've learned so much
in the past few days.</i>

54:33.460 --> 54:34.962
<i>I've still got a lot to learn.</i>

55:01.322 --> 55:02.757
I know I screwed up.

55:11.297 --> 55:13.166
I understand you're upset.

55:13.199 --> 55:14.702
You should be.

55:16.402 --> 55:19.306
It was stupid, what I said,
but it's not how I feel.

55:23.911 --> 55:25.213
And that's what scares me.

55:29.682 --> 55:31.318
This is scary for me, too.

55:33.186 --> 55:35.456
If I let you go to
New York without me,

55:37.056 --> 55:39.493
it'll be the biggest
mistake of my life.

55:44.764 --> 55:45.933
Really?

55:48.802 --> 55:50.438
There's no a doubt in my mind.

56:07.554 --> 56:10.357
So, how are we gonna do this?

56:12.259 --> 56:14.329
New York is a city
of hustlers, right?

56:15.896 --> 56:17.365
We'll hustle.

56:17.398 --> 56:20.300
I'll sell my car as
soon as we get there.

56:20.333 --> 56:22.736
That should give us enough
cash to get started.

56:22.769 --> 56:25.105
I'm supposed to start in a week.

56:26.139 --> 56:27.342
I'll drive fast.

56:37.518 --> 56:39.487
<i>Miss Randall
said she may be able to get you</i>

56:39.519 --> 56:41.355
<i>some shifts
in the deli section.</i>

56:41.387 --> 56:44.192
<i>I told her you were
good with your hands.</i>

56:44.224 --> 56:45.759
Don't go making any
commitments for me.

56:45.793 --> 56:47.961
I didn't go to film
school to make sandwiches.

56:47.994 --> 56:49.262
<i>I can see it now,</i>

56:49.295 --> 56:52.332
Ham and Cheese
<i>directed by Travis Wolfe.</i>

56:55.402 --> 56:57.304
Why didn't you tell
me he was a painter?

56:58.572 --> 56:59.440
<i>Who?</i>

57:01.375 --> 57:02.277
My dad.

57:03.077 --> 57:04.479
<i>Who told you that?</i>

57:05.378 --> 57:06.346
Uncle Robin.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.916
<i>How did
he get in contact?</i>

57:08.949 --> 57:10.284
<i>Is he bothering you?</i>

57:11.418 --> 57:12.553
<i>Travis, listen to me.</i>

57:12.585 --> 57:14.421
<i>Your uncle is a very sick man.</i>

57:14.454 --> 57:15.690
<i>Stay away from him.</i>

57:15.722 --> 57:16.891
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

57:16.923 --> 57:18.826
Yeah, I hear you.

57:18.858 --> 57:21.461
<i>You always think you
know everything, but you don't.</i>

57:24.998 --> 57:27.500
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, asshole, look.

57:27.534 --> 57:28.736
You're gonna sign on the line.

57:28.768 --> 57:30.370
You're forgetting something.
You know what you're forgetting?

57:30.403 --> 57:32.806
That we don't fucking
need you, all right?

57:32.840 --> 57:34.809
We don't need you,
my guys got scripts

57:34.842 --> 57:36.210
falling out the fucking door,
all right?

57:36.242 --> 57:39.145
We're gonna walk away
if you don't agree to this.

57:39.179 --> 57:40.548
Can Michelle get you anything?

57:40.581 --> 57:42.182
Coffee? Water?

57:42.215 --> 57:44.018
From what I hear, our cocktails
probably aren't up to your standards.

57:44.652 --> 57:46.519
All right, all right, look.

57:46.552 --> 57:47.922
- I'm okay.
- I got a meeting,

57:47.954 --> 57:49.155
so I got to go.

57:49.188 --> 57:51.125
Just sign on the line and
send it over, that's it.

57:53.393 --> 57:55.495
Well, it's nice to
finally meet you.

57:55.896 --> 57:56.965
Face to face.

57:58.132 --> 58:00.434
Hope you don't mind we're
doing it at the house.

58:00.467 --> 58:02.836
It's much more
comfortable this way, right?

58:02.869 --> 58:05.205
Oh, I know you and Simms went way
back, all the way to the beginning.

58:05.239 --> 58:07.007
And we were sorry
to see him go.

58:07.041 --> 58:10.278
But moving forward, I am thrilled to
start building some new projects with you.

58:11.010 --> 58:12.146
Successful ones.

58:13.614 --> 58:14.481
So am I.

58:15.882 --> 58:17.717
Man, I was watching an episode

58:17.751 --> 58:19.320
of <i>Daddy Oh</i> on
YouTube the other day,

58:19.353 --> 58:21.255
'cause I was, like,
five when that came out.

58:21.288 --> 58:22.222
Ah.

58:22.255 --> 58:24.357
That shit was really funny.

58:24.391 --> 58:25.360
You wrote all that?

58:25.960 --> 58:27.161
All by myself.

58:27.894 --> 58:28.963
Incredible.

58:30.530 --> 58:34.501
Not today, but one day,
we should think about remaking that.

58:34.534 --> 58:36.836
Package it up with an
influencer in the lead,

58:36.869 --> 58:38.906
I could see people
eating it up.

58:39.639 --> 58:40.607
An influencer?

58:41.742 --> 58:43.244
Not important,
we'll figure it out.

58:46.981 --> 58:50.151
So what have you
got for me today?

58:51.418 --> 58:54.922
Well, I've been working
on something really special.

58:54.954 --> 58:56.423
And if we can get the
networks interested,

58:56.456 --> 58:59.125
I can dive right into
a full pilot script.

58:59.159 --> 59:01.528
Okay, I like what you're thinking.
Tailored approach.

59:01.561 --> 59:03.931
No sense in pitching to
everybody all over town.

59:03.963 --> 59:05.032
Keep going.

59:05.298 --> 59:06.266
Okay.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.103
Set in the mid-'70s.

59:09.135 --> 59:11.806
Upper class family
living in Harlem.

59:11.838 --> 59:14.074
The richest block
in the neighborhood.

59:14.108 --> 59:16.744
The father, he owns
a funeral home.

59:16.777 --> 59:18.144
They bury all the
most prominent people

59:18.177 --> 59:19.512
in the neighborhood there.

59:19.545 --> 59:23.616
Each episode deals with a
different funeral and family,

59:23.650 --> 59:26.487
and the father having to cater
to their whims and issues.

59:28.355 --> 59:29.356
So it's a comedy.

59:30.824 --> 59:32.259
Elements of comedy.

59:32.291 --> 59:34.228
But also a drama, and action.

59:35.628 --> 59:36.730
So what's the story?

59:43.836 --> 59:44.706
Uh...

59:46.106 --> 59:48.543
Maybe I can develop the idea
a little bit more.

59:49.909 --> 59:51.346
Marinate on it.

59:52.179 --> 59:53.648
What else you got for me?

59:56.050 --> 59:58.185
Ah, come on, Robin.

59:58.217 --> 59:59.786
You haven't had a
show on television

59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.789
since I graduated high school.

01:00:02.822 --> 01:00:05.058
I'm gonna be completely
honest with you.

01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:08.094
After Simms retired,

01:00:08.128 --> 01:00:10.298
nobody at the agency
wanted to take you on.

01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:12.500
But I stepped up.

01:00:12.532 --> 01:00:15.068
But if we're gonna
continue this relationship,

01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:17.571
you got to give me
something to work with.

01:00:25.846 --> 01:00:28.048
What's this?

01:00:28.081 --> 01:00:30.917
It's a presentation video

01:00:30.951 --> 01:00:33.153
that I'm working on,
but it's rough.

01:00:35.222 --> 01:00:37.525
<i>If you want
to get to the root of my story,</i>

01:00:37.557 --> 01:00:40.527
<i>then you have to go back
to the day I was born.</i>

01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:42.929
I love the VHS look.

01:00:42.963 --> 01:00:44.331
It's very '90s.

01:00:44.364 --> 01:00:46.434
<i>Never give up your passion.</i>

01:00:46.467 --> 01:00:47.601
You know what?

01:00:47.634 --> 01:00:49.336
That's it.

01:00:49.369 --> 01:00:52.039
I knew you still had
some genius left in you.

01:00:52.072 --> 01:00:53.974
I know exactly how
we can package this.

01:00:54.007 --> 01:00:56.710
Uh, premium cable, maybe?

01:00:56.742 --> 01:00:57.978
Totally not what I was thinking.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.880
Look, frame it like
a reality show.

01:01:00.914 --> 01:01:02.450
Maybe a competition.

01:01:03.016 --> 01:01:04.684
Oh, write this down.

01:01:05.452 --> 01:01:08.255
Who can survive on the streets?

01:01:08.288 --> 01:01:11.291
Ordinary, normal people
but made homeless.

01:01:11.324 --> 01:01:12.393
Steve was just telling me

01:01:12.425 --> 01:01:13.827
that competitions
shows are back in.

01:01:15.228 --> 01:01:17.230
Is all the media on this drive?

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.636
Yeah, everything's there.

01:01:23.804 --> 01:01:25.139
Michelle!

01:01:26.206 --> 01:01:27.775
Run this over to the office.

01:01:27.807 --> 01:01:28.842
Have them take it down to post

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:30.277
and slap some
titles on it, okay?

01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:32.378
I'll email the creative.

01:01:32.411 --> 01:01:34.714
This is gonna be like
<i>Survivor</i> on crack.

01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:38.719
I love it!

01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:40.420
You fucking did it, man!

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.822
You did it!

01:01:41.855 --> 01:01:43.623
I had my reservations about you,

01:01:44.724 --> 01:01:46.226
but you pulled it off this time.

01:01:47.427 --> 01:01:49.195
We'll see if they like it,
we'll see if they like it.

01:01:49.228 --> 01:01:51.098
It could make some money,
could make some big money.

01:02:02.909 --> 01:02:04.811
Nephew, you're back.

01:02:04.844 --> 01:02:05.778
Have a seat.

01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:06.813
You want a drink?

01:02:06.847 --> 01:02:07.848
More ice cream?

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.282
No, I'm good.

01:02:09.315 --> 01:02:14.254
Hey, I feel like we're just
getting to know each other.

01:02:14.288 --> 01:02:16.757
What do you think about
staying for a little while?

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:18.992
You could take over one
of the bedrooms upstairs.

01:02:19.025 --> 01:02:20.193
I appreciate the offer,

01:02:20.226 --> 01:02:22.663
but I made a promise
that I should keep.

01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.264
Suit yourself.

01:02:24.297 --> 01:02:26.566
Hey, I was looking for my
hard drive, have you seen it?

01:02:28.702 --> 01:02:30.438
I had a meeting with
my new agent today.

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.139
I showed him some of your film.

01:02:33.172 --> 01:02:37.010
Guess what? He loved it.

01:02:37.043 --> 01:02:38.211
Nothing's in stone yet,

01:02:38.244 --> 01:02:41.848
but I feel like we
can sell the concept

01:02:41.882 --> 01:02:43.217
to a production company.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.518
The concept of what?

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.721
The concept of a reality show.

01:02:47.353 --> 01:02:49.355
Homeless in Hollywood.

01:02:49.389 --> 01:02:50.657
They were so excited,

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:52.393
they wanted your hard drive
right then and there.

01:02:52.425 --> 01:02:54.194
They're doing a rough cut on it
right now as we speak.

01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:55.162
My film was on there.

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:56.463
You have to get it back.

01:02:56.496 --> 01:02:58.398
Sure, as soon as they
finish working their magic.

01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:00.833
I need it now,
the screening is tomorrow.

01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:01.902
Well, I can't get it right now.

01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:02.869
Don't you got a another copy?

01:03:02.902 --> 01:03:04.605
No, that's the only one.

01:03:05.739 --> 01:03:08.476
I gave up everything
to finish this film.

01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:11.778
Forget about your
little student film.

01:03:11.811 --> 01:03:13.146
This is the big leagues.

01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:15.415
I'm talking about
a network show,

01:03:15.449 --> 01:03:17.351
with you as the
executive producer.

01:03:17.384 --> 01:03:18.552
We could be in this together.

01:03:18.585 --> 01:03:20.853
Without that film,
I can't graduate.

01:03:20.887 --> 01:03:22.557
My mom wasted all her money.

01:03:23.356 --> 01:03:25.525
Are you stupid?

01:03:25.559 --> 01:03:28.629
There'll be plenty of money
once the deal goes through.

01:03:28.661 --> 01:03:31.331
She was right about you,
you are fucked up.

01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:32.865
All you care about is yourself,

01:03:32.898 --> 01:03:36.203
your Hollywood friends,
and your fucking alcohol.

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.653
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:42.936
Nah, I got you.

01:04:42.969 --> 01:04:44.572
I know the perfect girl.

01:04:45.806 --> 01:04:47.307
We can trust her.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.708
She's family.

01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:52.880
I'll hit you up
when I get back in town.

01:04:55.882 --> 01:04:57.885
I'm not getting
involved in your shit.

01:05:00.753 --> 01:05:02.022
I'm not asking.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:05.725
Don't worry about it.

01:05:05.759 --> 01:05:07.961
I'll let you know
when I get back in town.

01:05:09.663 --> 01:05:10.664
Where you going?

01:05:11.264 --> 01:05:12.333
Vegas.

01:05:12.365 --> 01:05:13.634
I'll be back tomorrow night,

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:15.802
and make sure
this place is locked down.

01:05:17.103 --> 01:05:18.137
We set?

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:19.506
Most def.

01:05:20.172 --> 01:05:21.741
The fuck you say?

01:05:21.775 --> 01:05:22.675
Huh?

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:24.711
I'm not gonna let you
fuck this up!

01:05:25.244 --> 01:05:26.681
You understand?

01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:33.688
You're driving. Let's go.

01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:52.873
God damn, what the?

01:05:54.007 --> 01:05:55.309
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.510
Can I borrow your camera?

01:05:56.543 --> 01:05:58.112
I'll give it back at
the screening tomorrow.

01:05:58.144 --> 01:06:00.347
- No.
- Look, man, I need it now!

01:06:09.722 --> 01:06:10.925
Stay here.

01:06:15.929 --> 01:06:17.297
Here.

01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:18.598
You're gonna want these, too.

01:06:22.835 --> 01:06:24.038
Yo, Trav.

01:06:25.905 --> 01:06:27.375
You want some help?

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.815
Okay.

01:06:43.088 --> 01:06:46.059
And we are rolling.

01:06:48.027 --> 01:06:49.495
My name is Travis Wolfe.

01:06:49.528 --> 01:06:51.398
I'm 22 years old.

01:06:52.398 --> 01:06:54.601
I've always been alone.

01:06:54.634 --> 01:06:57.637
And I learned if you don't
expect much from other people,

01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.839
then they can't disappoint you.

01:07:01.641 --> 01:07:02.876
I don't know how
I ended up here,

01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:05.979
but I know it's exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

01:07:06.012 --> 01:07:11.419
When you hit rock bottom,
the only place to look is up.

01:07:19.259 --> 01:07:20.527
Wow.

01:07:24.998 --> 01:07:26.434
Yeah, good job, man.

01:08:37.103 --> 01:08:38.470
No cream, little sugar.

01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:40.207
Thanks.

01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:41.240
How's it going?

01:08:41.274 --> 01:08:42.676
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:47.747
<i>My name is Travis Wolfe.</i>

01:08:55.453 --> 01:08:56.856
<i>I've always been alone.</i>

01:08:57.457 --> 01:08:58.658
<i>Always been alone.</i>

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.694
<i>When you hit rock...</i>

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.002

01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:15.009

<i>but I know I'm exactly

01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:43.435
Think I should bring my 97s?

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.971
Most definitely.

01:09:50.243 --> 01:09:53.647
It's not gonna be the
same without you around.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.283
Bitch, don't get all
sentimental on me now.

01:09:56.315 --> 01:09:58.618
It's just happening so fast.

01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:03.324
Sure about it, right?

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:08.628
I mean, life moves fast.

01:10:10.529 --> 01:10:12.164
But seriously, guys,
thanks for holding on

01:10:12.198 --> 01:10:13.500
to my stuff for me.

01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:15.135
Don't worry, you best know

01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:17.003
I'm gonna be rocking your shit
when you're gone.

01:10:17.037 --> 01:10:18.005
Okay.

01:10:18.872 --> 01:10:20.273
And I'm gonna
sleep on your couch

01:10:20.305 --> 01:10:23.275
when I come visit you in
New York, once you blow up.

01:10:24.677 --> 01:10:26.512
Let's just hope you stop
snoring by then, okay?

01:10:26.546 --> 01:10:28.215
Shut up.

01:10:30.449 --> 01:10:32.586
I'm gonna put the rest
in here, okay?

01:10:32.618 --> 01:10:34.121
Wait!

01:10:35.454 --> 01:10:36.989
What the fuck?

01:10:37.023 --> 01:10:38.626
Where'd you get
all that money?

01:10:41.094 --> 01:10:42.096
Um...

01:10:43.296 --> 01:10:45.465
<i>Homelessness has gone up.</i>

01:10:45.497 --> 01:10:47.701
<i>There are over 55,000...</i>

01:10:49.969 --> 01:10:51.904
<i>There are over 55,000 people...</i>

01:10:51.938 --> 01:10:53.974
I know this marvelous hike
up off Reseda.

01:10:54.006 --> 01:10:55.041
Bye.

01:10:55.074 --> 01:10:56.109
You a hiker?

01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:58.979
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:59.011 --> 01:11:00.380
I get a hike vibe from you.

01:11:00.412 --> 01:11:02.048
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:02.082 --> 01:11:03.850
- Is that what we're... Okay.
- Yeah, I'll take you on a hike.

01:11:03.882 --> 01:11:05.484
I'll hit you up
after the screening.

01:11:05.518 --> 01:11:06.987
- Okay, bye.
- All right, bye.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.722
<i>Anywhere they can find shelter.</i>

01:11:08.755 --> 01:11:11.658
<i>Next to overpasses,
tents on the sidewalk,</i>

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:13.460
- <i>inside their cars.</i>
- Almost done?

01:11:13.493 --> 01:11:15.162
<i>It can happen to anybody.</i>

01:11:16.395 --> 01:11:17.764
Trav?

01:11:17.796 --> 01:11:19.098
Yeah, almost.

01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:41.487
Ta-da.

01:11:49.194 --> 01:11:51.163
<i>Hey, Robin.</i>

01:11:51.197 --> 01:11:52.532
<i>Bad news.</i>

01:11:52.564 --> 01:11:57.470
<i>The rest of the team isn't so
warm on the homeless project.</i>

01:11:57.503 --> 01:11:59.139
<i>Everybody's so PC these days,</i>

01:11:59.171 --> 01:12:01.340
<i>so I don't know
how much traction</i>

01:12:01.373 --> 01:12:03.577
<i>I'm gonna be able
to get on this one.</i>

01:12:03.609 --> 01:12:05.377
<i>But brush your shoulders off,</i>

01:12:05.411 --> 01:12:06.546
<i>we'll get them on the next one.</i>

01:12:12.318 --> 01:12:13.487
Fuck.

01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:16.990
Fuck.

01:12:47.554 --> 01:12:48.855
Kristen.

01:12:50.122 --> 01:12:51.357
Kristen.

01:12:52.158 --> 01:12:54.094
Kristen, you okay?

01:13:19.685 --> 01:13:21.020
Motherfucker.

01:13:21.054 --> 01:13:22.456
Have you seen my car keys, dude?

01:13:24.756 --> 01:13:26.826
Oh, here we go.

01:13:26.859 --> 01:13:28.427
I'm gonna leave right now, man.

01:13:28.461 --> 01:13:29.896
You gonna make it on time?

01:13:29.929 --> 01:13:31.163
I'm right behind you.

01:13:31.197 --> 01:13:32.265
All right.

01:13:32.297 --> 01:13:34.333
Hey, whatever you got,
it's good enough, all right?

01:13:34.367 --> 01:13:35.269
I know it.

01:13:37.203 --> 01:13:39.105
Hey.

01:13:39.137 --> 01:13:41.207
Seriously, man,
thank you for everything.

01:13:43.676 --> 01:13:45.245
Just get it there on time, dude.

01:13:45.278 --> 01:13:46.746
You got this, man.

01:13:59.425 --> 01:14:00.860
Excuse me.

01:14:03.529 --> 01:14:04.965
Oh, thank you.

01:14:08.935 --> 01:14:10.304
Excuse me.

01:14:12.438 --> 01:14:13.440
Hi.

01:14:13.472 --> 01:14:14.274
Oh, hey.

01:14:14.306 --> 01:14:15.975
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

01:14:16.009 --> 01:14:17.476
Good, you got a lot of luggage.

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:18.878
Oh, I know.

01:14:18.912 --> 01:14:21.648
I hope people don't mind
I'm taking up a lot of space.

01:14:29.956 --> 01:14:31.591
Where is she?

01:14:31.623 --> 01:14:33.792
- What?
- I said, where is she?

01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:34.793
What are you talking about?

01:14:34.827 --> 01:14:36.829
Where is she?

01:14:36.863 --> 01:14:38.030
- You're coming with me.
- Whoa.

01:14:38.064 --> 01:14:39.365
- What you doing, man?
- Hey!

01:14:40.899 --> 01:14:43.603
- What the fuck?
- Get in there, now.

01:14:43.636 --> 01:14:45.239
- Now!
- Ugh!

01:14:47.206 --> 01:14:48.641
God damn it, Bobby!

01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:14.401
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:23.677
Calm down!

01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.078
Fuck! Fuck!

01:15:26.112 --> 01:15:28.282
You need to tell me
where she is right now!

01:15:28.914 --> 01:15:30.617
Where is she? Come on!

01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:31.650
I'm not gonna hurt you,

01:15:31.684 --> 01:15:33.552
I'm just asking you,
where is she?

01:15:46.865 --> 01:15:47.766
Damn.

01:16:14.993 --> 01:16:17.197
You're gonna tell me
exactly where she is.

01:16:20.298 --> 01:16:21.234
Now.

01:16:22.368 --> 01:16:23.370
Fucking render!

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:26.206
Shit.

01:16:32.645 --> 01:16:33.813
Where's Travis?

01:16:33.845 --> 01:16:35.514
I don't know,
he should be here.

01:16:38.184 --> 01:16:40.520
Hey, what'd she say?

01:16:41.119 --> 01:16:43.222
Okay, well...

01:16:43.256 --> 01:16:45.191
Welcome students,
friends, and family

01:16:45.224 --> 01:16:47.260
to a very special evening...

01:16:49.061 --> 01:16:50.296
Do you know what's
gonna happen to me

01:16:50.328 --> 01:16:51.864
if I don't give them the money?

01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:53.600
You know what they're
gonna do to me?

01:16:53.632 --> 01:16:55.300
They're gonna kill me!

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:57.037
They're gonna kill me, man!

01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:59.072
Just tell me where she is!

01:17:00.305 --> 01:17:01.674
They're gonna come after her.

01:17:03.676 --> 01:17:06.713
She's at Travis' screening.

01:17:06.746 --> 01:17:08.248
- Movie screening.
- What?

01:17:30.603 --> 01:17:32.038
A tremendous
amount of work

01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:33.405
goes into what you'll
see here tonight.

01:17:33.439 --> 01:17:36.142
A lot of blood,
sweat, and tears.

01:17:36.175 --> 01:17:37.844
Thank you again,
folks, for coming.

01:17:37.877 --> 01:17:39.546
I want to let you know
a little about

01:17:39.578 --> 01:17:40.712
what you'll see tonight.

01:17:40.746 --> 01:17:41.980
The films you're about to see

01:17:42.014 --> 01:17:43.083
are really the
cream of the crop

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:44.050
of our program.

01:17:44.082 --> 01:17:45.984
Only the best of the best

01:17:46.018 --> 01:17:47.353
are going to be
shown here tonight,

01:17:47.386 --> 01:17:49.022
and just know that
these students

01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:50.523
have worked tremendously hard

01:17:50.555 --> 01:17:52.591
to bring you everything
you're about to see...

01:18:04.403 --> 01:18:06.405
Did he put this in her head?

01:18:06.439 --> 01:18:08.374
- What?
- Did he put this in her head?

01:18:08.407 --> 01:18:09.375
No!

01:18:09.408 --> 01:18:10.910
I don't know what kind of things

01:18:10.943 --> 01:18:12.011
that they're gonna
do to us, okay?

01:18:12.043 --> 01:18:13.313
She's going to New York.

01:18:14.713 --> 01:18:16.815
She got a job offer,
she starts next week,

01:18:16.849 --> 01:18:18.251
she's going to New York.

01:18:19.618 --> 01:18:20.619
Fuck.

01:18:20.653 --> 01:18:23.155
Get ready for a
very special evening,

01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:24.524
sit back and enjoy...

01:18:24.556 --> 01:18:27.359
Okay, we're gonna start
tonight's feature presentation

01:18:27.393 --> 01:18:29.261
with a very special film.

01:18:29.295 --> 01:18:30.430
I'd like you to sit back

01:18:30.462 --> 01:18:32.532
and really enjoy
this first picture

01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:34.333
from one of our
graduates, Simon Turner.

01:18:34.367 --> 01:18:36.402
- This better be good.
- Simon has already secured

01:18:36.435 --> 01:18:39.439
employment at one of the
major studios in town.

01:18:39.471 --> 01:18:41.140
Let's get right to it, folks.

01:19:27.686 --> 01:19:30.055
<i>Homelessness
has gone up 75%</i>

01:19:30.088 --> 01:19:32.759
<i>in Los Angeles
over the last six years.</i>

01:19:35.795 --> 01:19:38.532
<i>It's a crisis, an epidemic.</i>

01:19:39.798 --> 01:19:42.868
<i>The largest single group
of unsheltered people</i>

01:19:42.902 --> 01:19:45.672
<i>in America is here in LA.</i>

01:19:47.172 --> 01:19:50.275
<i>Next to overpasses,
tents on the sidewalk,</i>

01:19:50.309 --> 01:19:51.511
<i>inside their cars.</i>

01:19:52.944 --> 01:19:57.183
<i>There are over 55,000 people
that live on the streets,</i>

01:19:57.716 --> 01:19:59.351
<i>and I'm one of them.</i>

01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:08.193
Fuck, how could she
do this to me, man?

01:20:08.226 --> 01:20:11.530
She stole it.
My sister stole it.

01:20:28.546 --> 01:20:30.482
That was
unbelievable, right?

01:20:32.585 --> 01:20:33.619
Hey, bro.

01:20:33.653 --> 01:20:34.621
Here he is.

01:20:34.654 --> 01:20:36.289
Yo.

01:20:36.322 --> 01:20:38.358
- Brought the house down.
- Powerful stuff.

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:40.594
That was dope, man.
It's powerful stuff.

01:20:41.226 --> 01:20:42.327
You know, we never knew

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.895
you were going
through it like that.

01:20:43.929 --> 01:20:45.398
Why didn't you say something?

01:20:46.364 --> 01:20:47.699
It was the only way
I knew how to.

01:20:47.733 --> 01:20:50.235
Well, son of a bitch,
you said it well.

01:20:50.269 --> 01:20:51.871
Yeah, you did.

01:20:51.904 --> 01:20:52.639
We're proud of you, bro.

01:20:52.671 --> 01:20:54.239
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah, really.

01:20:54.273 --> 01:20:55.341
- Hey.
- Oh, okay.

01:20:55.373 --> 01:20:56.675
There she is.

01:20:58.243 --> 01:21:01.313
So fucking proud of you!

01:21:01.346 --> 01:21:02.814
- You did it.
- You liked it?

01:21:02.847 --> 01:21:03.983
It was fucking amazing.

01:21:04.015 --> 01:21:05.083
Yeah? Thank you.

01:21:05.117 --> 01:21:06.853
Thank you so much.

01:21:06.886 --> 01:21:07.887
Are you ready for New York?

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.221
Yes.

01:21:09.255 --> 01:21:10.856
- We're doing it.
- Got all the bags?

01:21:24.002 --> 01:21:25.904
Come here.

01:21:27.472 --> 01:21:29.908
Thank you.

01:21:29.942 --> 01:21:31.610
Yeah.

01:21:51.596 --> 01:21:53.365
Didn't expect to see you here.

01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:57.437
Well, here I am.

01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:00.740
And I'm really glad
I got to see your film.

01:22:00.773 --> 01:22:02.742
It was impressive.

01:22:02.774 --> 01:22:05.377
You found that truth
that I was talking about.

01:22:08.814 --> 01:22:12.018
Travis, I owe you an apology
for taking your film.

01:22:14.587 --> 01:22:17.357
I've put my needs above
others for far too long,

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:22.429
and I'm really sorry
if I disappointed you.

01:22:25.698 --> 01:22:29.502
You also deserve to know
what happened to your father.

01:22:30.435 --> 01:22:32.505
Oh, yeah, well,
maybe some other time.

01:22:32.805 --> 01:22:33.907
No.

01:22:37.243 --> 01:22:38.645
Now's the time.

01:22:47.485 --> 01:22:50.422
You know those two people
that I was telling you about,

01:22:51.724 --> 01:22:52.792
they were happy.

01:22:57.195 --> 01:22:58.430
But then things changed.

01:22:59.998 --> 01:23:02.769
One of them got an opportunity,
across the country.

01:23:04.703 --> 01:23:06.673
The other one had a family,

01:23:09.307 --> 01:23:10.877
had a son.

01:23:13.546 --> 01:23:15.014
We were in love, Travis.

01:23:16.748 --> 01:23:19.818
Your father and I,
we were in love.

01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:26.725
I've never loved
anyone more in my life.

01:23:29.728 --> 01:23:32.164
But we couldn't be together
and it killed him.

01:23:32.965 --> 01:23:34.534
And it destroyed me.

01:23:36.135 --> 01:23:37.003
Travis...

01:23:38.837 --> 01:23:39.938
I'm sorry.

01:23:43.809 --> 01:23:44.844
I'm sorry.

01:24:07.298 --> 01:24:08.501
Shit.

01:24:12.938 --> 01:24:15.208
I can't believe you
would steal from me.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.242
Your own brother!

01:24:16.274 --> 01:24:17.406
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:24:17.408 --> 01:24:19.144
After all I sacrifice.

01:24:20.311 --> 01:24:21.547
For you!

01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:23.749
Did he put you
up to this, huh?

01:24:23.782 --> 01:24:24.951
I didn't know
about anything!

01:24:24.984 --> 01:24:26.152
I don't believe you.

01:24:26.185 --> 01:24:27.420
- Relax, man.
- I won't let you!

01:24:27.453 --> 01:24:28.521
Relax.

01:24:28.554 --> 01:24:29.788
Now you're gonna
try and take my sister?

01:24:29.822 --> 01:24:31.724
- Now, just relax.
- I won't you let you, man!

01:24:31.756 --> 01:24:33.058
- I won't let you!
- Bobby, no!

01:25:51.302 --> 01:25:52.838
<i>Life.</i>

01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:55.742
<i>You can't write this script.</i>

01:25:56.774 --> 01:25:58.677
<i>The end of a scene</i>

01:25:58.711 --> 01:26:01.247
<i>is the beginning of
the next act.</i>

01:26:04.048 --> 01:26:06.985
<i>The trick is to
keep moving forward.</i>
