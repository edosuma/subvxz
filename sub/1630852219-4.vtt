00:43.213 --> 00:47.493
I'll ask you a few questions,
for clarification.

00:47.613 --> 00:51.693
I want to remind you
that you are under oath.

00:51.813 --> 00:57.973
You have sworn to speak the truth
and not withhold any information.

00:58.093 --> 01:00.493
Like the DA just asked you:

01:00.613 --> 01:03.413
On June 15, 2016...

01:03.533 --> 01:08.253
you stated that the suspect
present here, Annalisa Magliocca...

01:08.373 --> 01:12.533
was responsible for the death
of Mario Cantapane.

01:12.653 --> 01:15.413
According to you, the motive
for that murder was...

01:15.533 --> 01:21.653
the extramarital relationship you had
with the victim. Can you confirm this?

01:21.773 --> 01:23.813
I never said that.

01:23.933 --> 01:26.053
Could you please speak up a bit?

01:27.453 --> 01:29.533
I never said that.

01:29.653 --> 01:32.653
We have a signed statement from you.

01:41.093 --> 01:43.173
Do you recognize your signature?

01:46.293 --> 01:47.693
That's mine.

01:47.813 --> 01:49.453
I couldn't hear that.

01:49.573 --> 01:51.293
That's mine.

01:51.413 --> 01:54.773
Why did you sign something
you didn't say?

01:54.893 --> 01:56.853
I didn't read the statement.

01:56.973 --> 02:00.733
So the police altered your statement...

02:00.853 --> 02:03.133
or: what it says here is not true?

02:14.693 --> 02:16.853
No, your Honor, it's not true.

02:40.533 --> 02:43.133
- I have to go to the toilet.
- Go ahead.

03:06.093 --> 03:08.573
The other half, as promised.

03:14.853 --> 03:20.253
This place is crawling with cops, but are
you sure that I can go outside safely now?

03:20.373 --> 03:22.173
I swear it.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.373
Where are you going?

03:32.133 --> 03:36.373
It doesn't matter where I go.
I need to get far away from here.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.533
Don't forget your promise.

04:04.493 --> 04:08.493
Translated by: NederSubs

04:22.373 --> 04:23.773
Hi Gennaro.

04:24.773 --> 04:26.373
Hi GegÃ¨.

04:26.493 --> 04:28.773
So, what did you want to tell me?

04:35.653 --> 04:40.373
- My dad gave you that watch, right?
- Yes, for my graduation.

04:42.253 --> 04:46.493
- All Savastanos had one.
- I never took it off.

04:46.613 --> 04:49.813
That way I feel like I belong to a family.

04:51.853 --> 04:55.653
Only an orphan thinks
that family is a good thing.

05:05.173 --> 05:09.333
There is news from a friend of mine,
I wanted to tell you.

05:09.453 --> 05:13.453
- Has the shipment arrived?
- Tomorrow morning at seven o'clock.

05:14.893 --> 05:18.813
Arrange a berth for a 20-meter ship,
in Cala Galera.

05:18.933 --> 05:20.333
Consider it done.

05:20.453 --> 05:25.613
The ship is called Esperanza,
it sails under the Panamanian flag.

05:25.733 --> 05:28.453
I'll take care of it.
What about the payment?

05:28.573 --> 05:31.533
Cash. I need money to wage war.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.813
Who's buying buys outside of the System?

05:53.893 --> 05:56.053
Tomorrow morning, at the pier...

05:57.213 --> 06:00.933
I want to find a bottle of champagne.
Chilled.

06:26.173 --> 06:29.013
- Is this piece of junk yours?
- Yes.

06:29.133 --> 06:32.293
We're going to change that.
I'll buy you a new one.

06:34.693 --> 06:38.133
- Don't you worry.
- I do worry. Do you know why?

06:38.253 --> 06:41.093
I don't want to get tetanus
in your car.

06:42.453 --> 06:47.093
Tell that asshole Gennaro Savastano
that I want to see him immediately.

06:47.213 --> 06:50.093
Fire up this limousine
and bring me home.

06:56.453 --> 06:57.973
Thank you for coming here again.

07:13.693 --> 07:16.853
Ever since you're back,
he's been practicing to walk.

07:16.973 --> 07:20.493
Although he seems drunk,
because he doesn't walk straight.

07:20.613 --> 07:23.533
Did you hear that?
She called you a drunk.

07:23.653 --> 07:26.133
Hand him over to me,
I want to try something.

07:27.173 --> 07:29.253
Come here, you handsome.

07:29.373 --> 07:33.013
Come on, handsome grandson.
Let's see.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.333
- What are you doing?
- He loves wine.

07:36.573 --> 07:38.653
- What does it matter?
- It's unhealthy.

07:38.773 --> 07:43.413
- Why? I raised you with it.
- Stop it.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.413
He'll sleep very well.

07:58.453 --> 08:00.053
Hello, tell me.

08:08.813 --> 08:11.853
- Is that bitch out already?
- She wants to see you now.

08:11.973 --> 08:15.613
- What does she want?
- Your agreement is no longer valid.

08:16.693 --> 08:21.333
- She's gone crazy, she wants war.
- She, alone, versus me?

08:21.453 --> 08:24.933
She says she'll get everyone to join her
if she wants to.

08:25.053 --> 08:28.893
Always with that phone,
we can't even eat quietly for once.

08:29.013 --> 08:31.133
Your husband is a real businessman.

08:34.493 --> 08:37.413
Tell that whore
that I'll be there tonight.

08:37.533 --> 08:41.212
But not on her property,
I don't want any hassle.

08:46.013 --> 08:47.693
Wave at your father.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.453
- Do you really have to go to Naples?
- What can I do?

09:12.773 --> 09:16.213
Naples train station

10:13.293 --> 10:16.053
- A cup of coffee.
- One coffee at the bar.

10:21.093 --> 10:22.533
Here you go.

10:31.893 --> 10:36.013
- Tomorrow at 7 am you'll leave with Pietro.
- Where to?

10:36.133 --> 10:38.893
- To here.
- And you?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.933
Don't worry,
I'll come as soon as I'm done.

10:55.773 --> 10:57.893
Your father has become a problem.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.453
And I have to solve that problem.

11:07.453 --> 11:09.093
Come back soon.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.653
Say goodbye to daddy.

11:25.453 --> 11:27.693
Yes, the ship is called Esperanza.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.133
Exactly.
20 meters, tomorrow around 7:00 am.

11:34.893 --> 11:37.133
So the berth is arranged?

11:39.013 --> 11:40.653
Perfect, thanks.

11:42.093 --> 11:46.373
- How much stuff is there on board?
- 100 kilos, around five million.

11:46.493 --> 11:47.933
And our agreement?

11:48.053 --> 11:53.053
- It's hard. I can't get to his companies.
- What the fuck are you saying?

11:53.173 --> 11:57.053
You set up those companies
to channel my money away.

11:59.293 --> 12:01.093
Yes, I set them up.

12:03.773 --> 12:06.293
That is why they're unassailable.

12:09.413 --> 12:14.333
I'd never want
that because of those fucking companies...

12:14.453 --> 12:19.133
the people you love the most
get seriously hurt.

12:22.373 --> 12:24.893
I'll make sure it's okay.

12:25.013 --> 12:27.093
That's the spirit.

12:28.813 --> 12:31.013
We'll wait for that ship...

12:32.093 --> 12:35.293
and then it's over
for that asshole Gennaro.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.653
And then you'll come working for me.

13:30.133 --> 13:32.333
What's up, Bomba?

13:33.973 --> 13:37.333
She probably still wants to kill us,
because of her son.

13:37.453 --> 13:39.933
And we haven't forgotten about Track.

13:43.853 --> 13:46.573
Memory is important...

13:46.693 --> 13:51.693
but don't forget what shape we were in
last year, after the war.

13:51.813 --> 13:56.053
If we're going to wage war again,
we'll all get killed.

13:56.173 --> 13:59.773
I know that, but I can't help it.

13:59.893 --> 14:02.133
I can still see his face.

14:03.533 --> 14:06.093
I understand, Bomba...

14:06.213 --> 14:09.973
but he's looking at you now and saying:
Think carefully about what you'll do.

14:32.053 --> 14:34.413
Hi Gennaro. Weapons?

14:54.253 --> 15:00.173
- Annalisa. I'm happy you're free.
- I doubt that, Gennarino.

15:00.293 --> 15:03.453
- I thought it smelled like sewer...
- Ugly whore.

15:08.053 --> 15:11.293
We can better keep the dead
in the cemetery...

15:11.413 --> 15:13.933
otherwise we'll also end up there.

15:14.053 --> 15:17.733
And where do we end up
if we follow you?

15:17.853 --> 15:19.933
I lost a son.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.533
And now you think I'll be your maid?

15:23.653 --> 15:25.853
I shit on your money.

15:27.453 --> 15:29.413
It was convenient for you
when you were in jail.

15:29.533 --> 15:32.613
In there,
even shit looks like chocolate.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.373
Tell me, what do you want?

15:38.493 --> 15:40.173
Independence.

15:42.813 --> 15:44.533
Is that what you want?

15:45.853 --> 15:47.933
Yes, and do you know why?

15:48.053 --> 15:51.053
The only thing you can give me now,
is trouble.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.173
That is not true.

15:55.293 --> 15:58.693
I can still give you the only thing
you need:

15:58.813 --> 16:01.373
The best coke in the world.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.253
Or can't I?

16:03.373 --> 16:07.013
You are the only one in the Alliance
that I respect.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.973
Do you know why?

16:09.093 --> 16:12.573
Because you've earned it
with your own blood.

16:12.693 --> 16:15.013
That's why
I want to treat you differently.

16:17.293 --> 16:18.813
How do you mean?

16:22.093 --> 16:27.253
I let you keep your neighborhood and you
do what you want, if you give me a cut.

16:32.173 --> 16:34.093
- How much?
- 30 percent.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.693
Think about it.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.373
- I will think about it.
- Great.

16:45.013 --> 16:47.533
Ciro Di Marzio...
do you know anything about him?

20:01.253 --> 20:03.253
Look at this.

20:03.373 --> 20:06.133
I can no longer look at that ugly hair.

20:06.253 --> 20:09.653
Don't worry,
I'll make you beautiful again.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.213
Just hurry up.

20:13.773 --> 20:16.133
So, what do you think?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.373
What shall I say to Gennaro?

20:20.533 --> 20:22.253
That 30 percent is too much.

20:23.253 --> 20:25.653
I think 25 percent is also feasible.

20:27.733 --> 20:29.413
So I should accept it?

20:31.173 --> 20:35.733
For the time being. You need to
become stronger, and then we'll see.

20:36.813 --> 20:40.613
But how do we become stronger
when I'm still under Gennaro?

20:42.053 --> 20:45.333
You have to overcharge him.

20:45.453 --> 20:50.093
First you are at 25 percent,
otherwise the deal is off.

20:50.213 --> 20:52.333
And then you give him only 20 percent.

20:55.413 --> 20:58.973
How would he ever find out?
He's always in Rome.

20:59.973 --> 21:02.013
Besides, he trusts me.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.733
You're a really smart girl.

21:04.853 --> 21:08.253
You should have married my Lello...

21:08.373 --> 21:10.893
not that ugly slut Marinella.

21:12.373 --> 21:15.813
You can't choose your family,
but you can choose your friends.

21:26.613 --> 21:29.413
we have been together for so long

21:29.533 --> 21:32.213
we will never part

21:32.333 --> 21:35.053
we are the children of Vesuvius

21:35.173 --> 21:37.613
one day it will erupt

21:37.733 --> 21:40.493
you and I, our whole life together

21:40.613 --> 21:43.173
I cannot live without you

21:43.293 --> 21:45.973
when I'm dead,
I'll watch you from heaven

21:46.093 --> 21:48.733
sing a nice song at my funeral

21:51.813 --> 21:55.653
Turn that shit down.
It bothers the others.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.653
Carmela, we are having fun.

21:57.773 --> 22:01.213
Let Maria go,
she is working for me now.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.653
Don't be boring.

22:03.773 --> 22:06.213
Look at that.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.053
Where have you been?

22:08.173 --> 22:11.093
If it were up to you,
I would come only tomorrow.

22:11.213 --> 22:13.853
- Cantonese has been arrested.
- By the police?

22:13.973 --> 22:15.853
For that hassle at the stadium.

22:15.973 --> 22:20.013
- It's nothing, he'll be out tomorrow.
- We're going to get him now.

22:24.293 --> 22:25.733
Fire 'em up.

23:56.933 --> 23:58.413
How did you find me?

23:59.533 --> 24:02.693
Everyone knows
where the grandson of Santo lives.

24:05.933 --> 24:07.573
What can I do for you?

24:09.253 --> 24:13.853
I have five kilos of that stuff
that you didn't buy in Bulgaria.

24:16.013 --> 24:17.413
Interested?

24:22.093 --> 24:23.573
Certainly.

24:34.213 --> 24:36.533
Will you come back tomorrow
for the money?

24:38.333 --> 24:41.053
If it's real this time.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.470
That ugly bitch Cianel...

24:51.310 --> 24:53.310
I know her like the back of my hand now.

24:54.670 --> 24:56.870
The point is that she said yes.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.830
That's one less thing to worry about.

25:02.830 --> 25:05.590
I heard that my brother found work.

25:09.990 --> 25:11.550
Thank you.

25:37.990 --> 25:39.390
Hey guys.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.510
Come, we're going to sea.

26:20.390 --> 26:25.630
Yes, the ship has arrived.
No, I don't think Gennaro is here.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.390
What do we do now?

26:32.390 --> 26:33.910
Okay.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.190
- What is this?
- Go inside.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.390
- Who are you?
- Move it.

26:45.510 --> 26:47.150
- What do you want?
- Go inside.

27:12.310 --> 27:14.630
- Tell me, where is the stuff?
- What stuff?

27:14.750 --> 27:16.710
You're wasting my time.

27:16.830 --> 27:21.070
- There's nothing here, this is a mistake.
- There's nothing here.

27:21.190 --> 27:23.190
- See?
- Come with me.

27:24.630 --> 27:27.470
What the fuck do you mean,
it isn't here?

27:29.350 --> 27:30.950
Fuck you.

27:33.230 --> 27:34.750
Motherfucker.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.710
My family has nothing left,
except for this shithole.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.350
They didn't let us keep anything.

28:28.470 --> 28:30.270
They took everything from us.

28:31.590 --> 28:34.430
But one day we'll be back,
bigger than ever.

28:36.550 --> 28:39.470
This is the first down payment, 20,000.
Count it.

28:41.030 --> 28:42.590
Not necessary.

28:47.270 --> 28:49.190
Wait. Where are you going?

28:50.310 --> 28:53.550
I have to tell you something
about my family.

28:55.910 --> 28:59.630
Do you know how Santo
started smuggling?

28:59.750 --> 29:02.230
He was homeless and was starving.

29:03.350 --> 29:06.190
One day he stole an American's car...

29:06.310 --> 29:08.270
and there was $30,000 in it.

29:08.390 --> 29:10.110
Lucky him.

29:12.310 --> 29:16.790
His mate Stregone was with him,
he was also just very little.

29:16.910 --> 29:19.990
He came up with the idea
of smuggling cigarettes.

29:21.270 --> 29:23.110
And so the empire began.

29:24.310 --> 29:26.030
What are you saying?

29:29.790 --> 29:31.950
There are two things that matter
in this world:

29:33.390 --> 29:35.470
Happiness and friends.

29:40.750 --> 29:45.110
Good times are over, Enzo.
The world has changed.

29:45.230 --> 29:48.430
Fine, but we could use your brain.

29:52.910 --> 29:57.630
You think we're a bunch of losers,
but we fear nothing and no one.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.270
Join us.

30:19.230 --> 30:20.950
There they are.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.310
Give us a hand.

30:56.990 --> 30:58.670
Hurry up.

32:06.270 --> 32:07.670
Here, Bomba.

32:14.510 --> 32:17.230
Take the shipment
to the plastic depot.

32:17.350 --> 32:19.270
I see you tomorrow morning.

32:19.390 --> 32:22.670
- Where are you going?
- To a new Calabrian contact.

32:22.790 --> 32:24.190
Be careful.

32:36.670 --> 32:39.510
Biagio, the stuff is inside.
It's ready tomorrow.

32:44.950 --> 32:47.950
- Have you changed your mind?
- I don't know.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.630
What's the problem?

32:51.750 --> 32:54.990
The problem is
that you don't sell to us usually.

32:55.110 --> 32:57.670
But I have to expand my territory.

32:57.790 --> 32:59.830
And your price has also changed.

33:00.990 --> 33:03.470
Mate, why do you almost
give it away for free?

33:11.350 --> 33:15.550
Without you, I would've been killed
in Germany, just like Mico.

33:15.670 --> 33:18.430
You warned me
and this is me saying thank you.

33:21.470 --> 33:23.310
What are we going to do?

33:27.750 --> 33:29.150
Great.

34:03.110 --> 34:04.510
Hello, GegÃ¨.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.270
What are you doing here?

34:12.469 --> 34:13.870
Take a seat.

34:18.070 --> 34:19.790
Are you afraid of me or something?

34:23.030 --> 34:24.949
I said, take a seat.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.870
You must be exhausted.

34:47.230 --> 34:49.190
You always work long hours.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.910
Now that you have a new boss.

35:09.870 --> 35:13.910
I had no choice.
Avitabile threatened Silvano.

35:14.030 --> 35:17.190
What do I care about that guy
that is fucking you in the arse?

35:23.830 --> 35:28.350
You ratted me out to Avitabile
and he doesn't even give you bodyguards.

35:35.510 --> 35:38.390
Did you think
I wouldn't come looking for you?

35:40.870 --> 35:46.110
Gennaro, you have to believe me. The money
is safe, Avitabile can't get to it.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.870
You said you belonged to the family.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.230
That's why I let people tail you.

35:59.510 --> 36:03.670
If there's one thing I learned,
it's that you can't trust family.

36:12.190 --> 36:13.590
Forgive me.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.270
Please forgive me.

36:22.190 --> 36:24.430
Your companies are safe.

36:27.270 --> 36:29.190
That's all I could do.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.630
The watch.

38:11.470 --> 38:15.070
- Hey?
- Azzurra, how are you?

38:16.070 --> 38:18.990
I already told you, everything is fine.

38:19.110 --> 38:22.510
- And Pietro?
- He's sleeping.

38:23.790 --> 38:26.710
Have you spoken to your father?
Do you know where he is?

38:26.830 --> 38:30.270
No, I came here, that's all I know.

38:30.390 --> 38:31.790
Everything alright?

38:32.870 --> 38:36.390
Yeah, fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

38:37.390 --> 38:38.870
Good night.

38:41.350 --> 38:44.670
That bastard
took everything away from me.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.670
And now I'm going to
take everything back, step by step.

38:47.790 --> 38:49.670
And I'll start with you.

38:52.070 --> 38:56.030
If I hadn't picked you up,
where would you have gone?

38:59.070 --> 39:02.390
- Nowhere.
- Bullshit.

39:02.510 --> 39:06.750
If my men had come a little later,
where would you be now?

39:06.870 --> 39:10.150
Were you on the run?
Did you want to screw me over as well?

39:11.750 --> 39:13.270
Do you know what I thought?

39:13.390 --> 39:17.910
Maybe that asshole would've locked me up,
and you'd know about it.

39:18.030 --> 39:19.990
Did you do it together?

39:20.110 --> 39:25.030
I have nothing to do with it, I swear.
I have nothing to do with it.

39:25.150 --> 39:27.230
Let me go, you're hurting me.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.590
Make sure he's quiet.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.150
Quiet.

40:41.190 --> 40:43.910
- Guys.
- Gennaro.

40:44.030 --> 40:46.630
- Look what I brought with me.
- Beer?

40:46.750 --> 40:48.830
- Thanks.
- Open it.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.630
- Can I have your lighter?
- Yes.

40:57.230 --> 40:59.070
We have to toast.

41:00.110 --> 41:02.270
- Give it to me.
- Didn't you have one already?

41:02.390 --> 41:04.190
- A toast to what?
- Our health.

41:04.310 --> 41:05.950
Money.

41:06.070 --> 41:07.750
To us, boys.

41:16.710 --> 41:20.670
I can't trust anyone, only you two.

41:22.630 --> 41:25.630
But I need to know if you have my back.

41:27.190 --> 41:28.910
We have your back.

41:29.030 --> 41:30.950
- Sure?
- Sure.

41:32.670 --> 41:34.070
Come here.

41:40.270 --> 41:42.470
There is a lot of money coming.

41:43.750 --> 41:45.150
Come with me.

42:16.910 --> 42:18.830
Prepare the transfer.

42:20.110 --> 42:22.190
What the hell?

42:22.310 --> 42:24.150
Who are you?

42:24.270 --> 42:27.310
- Shut up.
- Move one inch and I'll shoot.

42:27.430 --> 42:29.030
Take it easy.

42:29.150 --> 42:32.070
- Hands to yourself.
- Get in the car.

42:33.710 --> 42:36.950
- Take it easy.
- Where are you taking him?

42:37.070 --> 42:38.790
Don't worry.

42:48.910 --> 42:51.190
Tell me who sent you.

42:51.310 --> 42:54.070
Tell me who is sending you.

42:57.470 --> 43:00.910
Stop the car. Why?
Stop the car.

43:48.150 --> 43:50.750
Come on, walk. Move it.

44:02.590 --> 44:04.670
On your knees.

44:04.790 --> 44:06.430
On your knees.

45:43.310 --> 45:46.990
Tell me,
do you think Avitabile is a bitch?

45:57.470 --> 46:00.350
Why do you think
you can fuck with him?

46:29.750 --> 46:31.150
Poor fellow.

46:39.910 --> 46:42.790
Do you know why I had you brought here?

46:43.950 --> 46:47.550
To show you how retarded you have been.

46:47.670 --> 46:53.310
Do you really think the Calabrians
would choose your side?

46:53.430 --> 46:55.750
Against us all?

46:55.870 --> 46:59.550
Do you know why I came here?
Do you know why?

47:01.470 --> 47:03.630
To kill you myself.

47:07.190 --> 47:09.710
But you are the father of my grandson.

47:11.350 --> 47:13.470
The husband of my daughter.

47:15.150 --> 47:17.230
But one thing I know for sure:

47:17.350 --> 47:19.790
From now on
you're not worth anything anymore.

47:20.830 --> 47:24.590
You will no longer sell drugs
in the center of Naples.

47:26.070 --> 47:29.990
You're not going to sell anyone
drugs anymore, you know why?

47:30.110 --> 47:32.830
The new supplier only talks to us.

47:34.110 --> 47:37.190
We beheaded your friend in Honduras.

47:42.630 --> 47:45.110
Did you want to take away what's mine?

47:45.230 --> 47:47.750
Now you have nothing left.

47:47.870 --> 47:52.230
I reported you anonymously to the
Serious Fraud Office for money laundering.

47:52.350 --> 47:56.950
During their research they have frozen
everything: the companies and the money.

47:57.070 --> 47:59.310
You have absolutely nothing...

47:59.430 --> 48:03.750
so just crawl back into your sewer
and stay there.

48:03.870 --> 48:07.510
If you take one step outside of
Secondigliano, I'll destroy you.

48:09.350 --> 48:10.990
But most of all...

48:12.550 --> 48:14.830
You no longer have a wife and child.

48:16.990 --> 48:19.190
You can't do that to me.

48:19.310 --> 48:21.710
They are my flesh and blood.

48:21.830 --> 48:23.910
You don't deserve her.

48:25.630 --> 48:28.310
So she'll come back to me.

48:28.430 --> 48:31.230
I will let you live.
Lonely, like a dog.

48:32.310 --> 48:35.030
You didn't deserve her.

48:35.150 --> 48:38.630
If you don't earn something,
you lose it.

48:38.750 --> 48:40.150
Go ahead.

49:24.790 --> 49:28.110
If I find out
that he came looking for you...

49:28.230 --> 49:30.350
and you know I will...

49:31.510 --> 49:34.990
I swear to the Holy Virgin
that I'll cut off his head.
