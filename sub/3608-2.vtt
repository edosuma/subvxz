00:02.001 --> 00:03.836
Previously on Lost:

00:04.421 --> 00:06.589
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.642
- We have to fire the flare.
- It doesn't make...

00:17.726 --> 00:21.521
Look, are you gonna give me the damn
gun, or am I gonna have to take it?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.775
Please, God!

00:28.153 --> 00:30.154
It's coming back! It's coming back!

00:34.952 --> 00:39.288
- We're gonna have to take the boy.
- What? What did you say?

00:39.373 --> 00:41.999
The boy. We're gonna have to take him.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.130
Hey! Hey! What...

00:47.214 --> 00:49.173
Dad!

00:52.136 --> 00:54.220
Dad! Help me!

00:54.304 --> 00:56.472
- Walt!
- Help me, Dad!

01:04.480 --> 01:05.898
No, no, no...

01:05.983 --> 01:08.609
Stop it! Stop it! We can't!

01:16.827 --> 01:20.997
Locke found a... a hatch in the ground.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.918
The sun comes up in three hours
and we're all gonna see that happen.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.504
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?
Together.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.925
- John, what are you doing?
- I'm going in.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.429
Locke's going into that thing,
whether you like it or not.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.098
I'm going to the hatch.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.934
- Live together, die alone, right?
- Right.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.321
John!
I think there's something down here!

02:07.211 --> 02:10.463
Dad, please! Dad!

02:10.547 --> 02:12.548
Walt!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.509
Oh, no!

02:15.302 --> 02:18.387
Walt! Walt!

02:19.014 --> 02:20.723
- Walt!
- Mike!

02:24.311 --> 02:26.020
Sawyer!

02:26.104 --> 02:29.565
- Jin!
- Michael! On fire!

02:31.068 --> 02:33.569
- Michael!
- Walt!

02:34.029 --> 02:35.279
Mike!

02:37.616 --> 02:41.744
Walt! Walt!

02:54.633 --> 02:59.762
Hang on, Mike!

03:01.098 --> 03:02.598
- Hang on!
- Walt!

03:16.488 --> 03:21.242
Mike.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.453
Mike! Mike!

03:35.132 --> 03:36.799
Kate!

04:25.349 --> 04:26.599
Mike!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.918
- Where's Walt?
- I don't know.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.420
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

04:57.130 --> 04:59.840
Where the hell is my son?

04:59.925 --> 05:01.550
Walt!

05:07.224 --> 05:09.433
How'd you hurt your leg?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.479
- Got hit by a car.
- Ow.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.106
Yeah.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.067
So, this is the paperwork
your ex-wife sent over...

05:18.151 --> 05:22.738
She's not my ex-wife, man.
She's just Walt's mother.

05:24.116 --> 05:28.035
She... Susan, she just got a job
in Rome with her boyfriend.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.079
They want to take Walt with them.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.457
Don't worry, I'm gonna take
real good care of you, Mr. Dylan.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.459
Dawson.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.962
Right. Sorry. Dawson.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.008
So this boyfriend,
this is this guy Brian Porter?

05:42.092 --> 05:43.884
Yeah. Why? What's it say?

05:43.969 --> 05:49.849
It seems that Susan wants you to
relinquish your rights as Walt's father

05:49.933 --> 05:54.103
- so that Mr. Porter can adopt him.
- She wants me to sign my son away?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.440
It's the only way they can proceed
with the adoption, yeah.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.650
Listen, if you sign this document,

05:59.735 --> 06:03.612
legally he'll be no different than
any other kid you pass on the street.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.700
You'd be giving up your paternal rights.
All of them.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.952
So then, can I stop her from going?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.371
Well,
I guess we could file an injunction

06:12.456 --> 06:18.044
- so she couldn't leave the city, but...
- Yeah, that. That. I want to do that.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.628
Right.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.632
Mr. Dawson,

06:23.759 --> 06:27.344
the fact that you came in through
these doors tells me something.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.640
It tells me that I'm the best
that you can afford.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.686
If we go forward with this,
it's gonna take money.

06:35.771 --> 06:39.148
A lot of it. Even at my rates.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.653
This is David and Goliath,
so I gotta ask you,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.822
are you sure you wanna do this?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.576
They're not taking my son away.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.497
Walt!

06:59.503 --> 07:02.922
- Mike! You should save your energy.
- They took my son!

07:03.006 --> 07:06.717
Yeah, I saw. Onto a boat, which means
he's not in shouting distance!

07:06.802 --> 07:09.095
- You don't know that!
- I got a good sense.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.097
Even if he was,
there's nothing you can do.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.183
If he can hear me, he knows I'm alive,

07:14.309 --> 07:17.770
that I'm coming for him,
that I'm going to get him back!

07:17.854 --> 07:20.981
Right now, all I got is that
maybe my son can hear me...

07:21.066 --> 07:23.818
- Does that make any sense to you?
- Yeah.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.951
Walt!

07:51.471 --> 07:52.972
Kate!

09:16.765 --> 09:18.724
Kate.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.769
- John?
- Easy, easy, easy.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.520
Behind you.

09:27.317 --> 09:33.822
Are you him?

09:38.787 --> 09:43.749
Jin!

09:46.127 --> 09:48.420
I thought we had to save our energy.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.759
Yeah, well,
Jin's still out there in the water,

09:53.843 --> 09:57.179
so if it's OK by you
I'm gonna keep shoutin' a while.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.352
- Feeling guilty.
- What?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.481
You made me fire that flare.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.819
I made you fire...

10:12.320 --> 10:14.196
What, this is my fault?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.490
They took my son.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.119
They found us, took Walt,
because you made me fire the flare.

10:20.203 --> 10:23.622
Well, at least Walt is on a boat.
Probably wrapped in a blanket

10:23.707 --> 10:26.875
- with a cup of cocoa while we're on...
- Get off my raft.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.460
- What?
- Get...

10:30.130 --> 10:31.922
What the hell was that?

10:56.948 --> 11:00.576
I see you managed to hold on
to your best friend, there.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.536
Thing ain't gonna work anyway.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.496
- It'll work.
- You were underwater.

11:04.581 --> 11:08.625
What do you know about guns anyway,
Hoss? It'll work.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.843
If the bullets are dry,
the powder's dry. If the powder's...

11:23.850 --> 11:26.518
What the hell is that?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.604
It's a shark.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.484
It's only a shark.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.946
"It's only a shark?" That's supposed
to make me feel better?

11:38.031 --> 11:41.784
Well, I guess I know why the shark
is hanging around. Your shoulder.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.495
Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then.

11:46.373 --> 11:50.334
You suddenly forget what happened?
Why I got shot?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.337
- What?
- How about a little gratitude here?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.216
I mean, how about, "Thank you?"

11:57.300 --> 12:01.345
Thank you? For what?
For you trying to save your own ass?

12:05.642 --> 12:09.770
You want me off this raft? You got it!

12:44.681 --> 12:47.307
I was trying to save your damn kid.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.522
Let's talk about Walt, shall we,
Mr. Dawson?

12:55.233 --> 12:57.484
Sure. OK.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.279
When was the last time
you actually saw your son?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.867
- About a year ago.
- It was 14 months, actually.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.120
- Is that a question, Lizzy?
- Why is that, Mr. Dawson?

13:09.247 --> 13:13.792
- Why so long?
- Susan took him to Amsterdam. For work.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.795
- You didn't have a problem with that?
- Excuse me?

13:16.880 --> 13:20.632
Well, since she's now going to Rome
and you're filing an injunction,

13:20.717 --> 13:24.887
- it just seems a little inconsistent.
- Incon... No.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.930
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Don't...

13:27.015 --> 13:29.475
She took him, though.
I didn't want her to go.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.978
- You said there was nothing I could do.
- And you didn't, did you?

13:33.062 --> 13:36.773
- He's not gonna answer that.
- Because there is no answer.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.109
You were in an accident recently?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.071
Yeah.

13:43.156 --> 13:47.242
You had several surgeries,
spent weeks in a private hospital room,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.578
extensive rehabilitation.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.124
- Who paid for all that, Mr. Dawson?
- I didn't ask you for anything.

13:54.209 --> 13:58.670
Could the record reflect Mr. Dawson
acknowledged Miss Lloyd paid his bills?

13:58.755 --> 14:01.548
Susan, tell them
that I didn't ask you...

14:01.633 --> 14:04.968
Please don't address my client directly.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.013
Do you know what Walt's
first words were, Mr. Dawson?

14:08.097 --> 14:10.724
- I'm sorry, what?
- His first words.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.185
Do you know what they were?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.686
I...

14:15.104 --> 14:17.648
No. I... I wasn't there.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.109
Do you know what his favorite food is?

14:23.279 --> 14:24.446
- Do you...
- No.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.698
OK. This is unnecessary...

14:27.242 --> 14:28.534
No.

14:28.618 --> 14:32.704
Well, for someone who wants
to retain his paternal rights so badly,

14:32.789 --> 14:36.041
you don't seem to know much
about your son, Mr. Dawson.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.211
I'm his father.

14:39.295 --> 14:43.131
I'm sorry, could you say that louder,
please? Just for the record?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.093
I'm his father.

14:59.023 --> 15:03.986
Are you crazy? You gonna take
the bullet out with your bare hands?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.822
You got a better idea?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.825
Then go to hell.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.832
Never gonna be able to do it
by yourself.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.377
- I thought we parted ways.
- We're caught in the same current.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.797
He's still talking.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.218
Come on...

16:05.214 --> 16:07.633
You got a Band-Aid?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.727
Are you? Are you him?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.068
Yes.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.782
Yes, I am.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.748
I can't believe it. You're finally here.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.378
Well, here I am.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.178
Who's she?

16:58.726 --> 17:01.019
She's with me.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.358
What did one snowman
say to the other snowman?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.326
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.287
Get rid of the knife. You're not him!

17:27.797 --> 17:32.134
- We didn't come here to hurt you.
- Yeah? Then why did you come?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.803
We were in a plane crash.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.723
Were you now? And when was that?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.308
Forty-four days ago.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.729
Forty-four days?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.905
Move.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.921
- How long have you been down here?
- Shut it.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.807
Tie him up.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.768
Do it!

18:23.853 --> 18:26.646
Wait, wait, you're tying up
the wrong person.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.775
- How's that, brother?
- It's pointless to tie me up.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.612
I'm not dangerous.
But her? She's a fugitive.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.287
What does that make you, then, brother?

18:42.371 --> 18:46.374
I'm a regional collections manager
for a cardboard manufacturer.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.376
Boxes, primarily.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.839
All right then, Box Man. Tie her up.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.052
- Don't you dare touch...
- Hey!

18:57.136 --> 18:59.095
You be a good girl, right?

19:01.766 --> 19:05.185
- What do you think you're doing?
- What's best for all of us.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.442
Right, bring her here.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.236
Hey, John...

19:14.320 --> 19:17.572
- Hey, wait! Hey!
- Shut it.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.241
Wait!

19:23.037 --> 19:26.081
You're kiddin', right?
You're going back?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.876
- Yeah.
- What about all that stuff you said

19:29.961 --> 19:33.255
about waiting until morning
and watching the sun rise?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.590
I changed my mind.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.431
What do you suppose all that's about?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.101
I reckon Jack's
gonna do something heroic.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.270
What?

19:49.105 --> 19:52.816
You always try to be funny when
you don't want to answer a question.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.610
"Try" to be funny?

19:58.614 --> 20:00.699
What's this?

20:06.831 --> 20:09.666
- I found it in the jungle.
- You found it?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.127
Yeah. Be careful...

20:12.253 --> 20:15.380
Be careful with it.
Here, hey, take Aaron.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.884
Come here. There you go.

20:18.968 --> 20:23.471
You gotta be careful with it, you know,
it's the Virgin Mary. She's holy.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.849
I didn't realize you were so religious.

20:27.059 --> 20:32.105
I'm not. It's just, you know,
it might come in handy.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.984
Be a nice thing to have around.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.539
It wasn't the flare.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.836
I said it wasn't the flare.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.090
Those people that did this...

21:01.093 --> 21:04.846
At first I thought they were fishermen
or pirates or something.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.850
Then I got a good look at their boat.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.686
You know anything about boats, Mike?

21:13.022 --> 21:15.941
Boat like that wasn't built
for the open ocean.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.069
Water's coming over the side
the first little squall.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.446
Maybe got a range of a hundred miles.

21:21.530 --> 21:26.785
Nope. A boat like that had to have
left port from somewhere close.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.996
Like the island.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.918
French chick said the Others
were coming for the kid.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.754
I think they came, Mike.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.841
- What?
- He's the one they wanted,

21:41.926 --> 21:44.094
why I got a bullet in my shoulder.

21:44.178 --> 21:47.305
Hell, Bluebeard blew us up
because they wanted your kid.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.767
- You saying this is my fault?
- Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.812
They took him because of you.
They were sailing away!

21:53.896 --> 21:57.148
They found us because
they were looking for us! For Walt!

21:57.233 --> 22:01.361
- Don't ever say his name again, ever!
- What you gonna do? Splash me?

22:44.530 --> 22:47.991
- Look. I know...
- Shut up!

22:50.119 --> 22:52.245
Don't even...

22:52.329 --> 22:58.126
You have no idea what it's like
to care for somebody else.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.639
Hi.

23:15.186 --> 23:19.856
- Where are your lawyers?
- I told them I wanted to talk.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.233
Just you and me.

23:22.318 --> 23:26.154
- But if you want yours, I understand.
- No. It's OK.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.414
I think you're gonna win.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.252
Excuse me?

23:41.337 --> 23:46.216
In court. I think you're going to keep
me from leaving the country with Walt.

23:46.300 --> 23:50.178
But I just have to ask you why.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.140
- Why what?
- Why are you doing this?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.727
- He's my son.
- Since when, Michael?

23:57.812 --> 24:00.939
Look, I know you don't care
about what's best for me,

24:01.023 --> 24:03.900
but in Rome
I'll be a senior partner at the firm.

24:03.984 --> 24:06.569
I'll be able to give Walt
anything he needs.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.823
You're still on disability, Michael.
You can't work.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.991
You're about to be evicted.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.078
- Got your lawyers checking up on me?
- Of course I did.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.665
Just like you had your lawyers check up
on me. Nobody's winning.

24:18.749 --> 24:21.042
Then stop.

24:22.545 --> 24:27.006
Michael, the first thing you need to do
is take care of yourself.

24:28.926 --> 24:32.720
You need to get healthy, you need to get
back on your feet financially

24:32.805 --> 24:35.098
so you can get back
to pursuing your art.

24:36.559 --> 24:39.310
You have rare talent as an artist,
Michael.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.855
But how are you going to do that,
any of that,

24:42.773 --> 24:45.024
and still be a part of Walt's life?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.487
I'll do it by doing it.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.740
Walt is my responsibility too.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.743
Then let him go.

24:57.830 --> 25:02.250
Because it's not about you or me.
It's about him.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.848
I don't want to go to court, Michael.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.643
So please, just...

25:22.771 --> 25:25.064
...let him go.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.795
The pilot said
we had lost radio contact,

28:33.879 --> 28:37.048
but by then we were already
a thousand miles off course.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.717
Any search teams
would've given up weeks ago.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.678
So you were traveling
from Sydney to Los Angeles?

28:42.763 --> 28:43.971
Yes.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.891
So the world is still out there?

28:46.975 --> 28:49.602
Yeah, as far as I know.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.855
Could you tell me your name?

28:56.693 --> 28:58.778
My name?

29:01.281 --> 29:02.615
My name is Desmond.

29:04.118 --> 29:06.411
Desmond, I'm John.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.747
You should know
the gun is really unnecessary.

29:09.832 --> 29:13.960
Oh, yeah? So I should just hand it
over to you then, should I?

29:17.965 --> 29:20.258
How many of you are there?

29:20.342 --> 29:24.429
Forty-three. But four sailed out
this morning on a raft.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.180
A raft?

29:27.516 --> 29:30.893
That simulated sunlight,
is that because you never leave?

29:30.978 --> 29:33.479
Is there another way out?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.899
How many of your group have gotten sick?

29:37.025 --> 29:41.195
- Sick?
- Sick. As in ill. As in dead.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.031
Is that why it says "quarantine"
on the hatch?

29:44.116 --> 29:48.286
- Answer the question!
- No one has... No one, no one is sick.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.553
Get up.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.477
Move.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.854
Stand right there.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.901
Do you know how to use this, Box Man?

30:20.068 --> 30:23.321
- Haven't seen one of those in 20 years.
- Do you know how?

30:23.405 --> 30:24.697
- Yes.
- Sit.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.410
Right, now listen carefully.

30:29.495 --> 30:33.623
Type in exactly what I tell you.
Understand? Exactly. Nothing else.

30:33.707 --> 30:38.002
Four... eight... 15...

30:41.507 --> 30:44.050
- Do you hear that?
- What?

30:45.802 --> 30:49.263
What'd you just put in?
What number did you just put in?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.682
- Fifteen.
- Right, 16...

30:52.392 --> 30:54.936
...23... 42...

30:55.896 --> 30:57.939
Now press "execute."

31:08.534 --> 31:10.618
- What's gonna happen?
- Just push it.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.049
Kate!

31:25.801 --> 31:27.802
- Locke!
- Who the hell is that?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.472
That would be Jack.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.785
Who is he?

31:53.453 --> 31:56.664
His name is Jack. He's our doctor.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.791
What's he doing here?

31:59.626 --> 32:02.837
To be honest with you,
I'm a little surprised to see him.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.759
Your doctor has a gun, brother.

32:11.013 --> 32:12.763
Move.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.195
Make one sound and I'll shoot.
Move!

32:40.709 --> 32:43.210
Jack! Jack!

32:45.255 --> 32:46.714
Jack!

32:48.133 --> 32:50.676
I wouldn't do that, Jack.

32:52.554 --> 32:57.600
- Where's Kate? What the hell did you...
- Move and I kill him.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.894
- Put the gun down.
- Where's Kate?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.771
- Jack, it's OK.
- I said drop it!

33:01.855 --> 33:03.689
- Where's Kate?
- She's fine. Put down...

33:03.774 --> 33:05.441
I'm not putting down anything...

33:07.069 --> 33:09.945
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

33:11.281 --> 33:15.326
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke? Is this your destiny?

33:15.410 --> 33:18.329
- "All roads lead here?"
- Calm down.

33:19.623 --> 33:23.584
Lower your gun, or I'll blow
his damned head off, brother.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.681
You!

34:05.335 --> 34:07.294
What the hell is that?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.966
It's part of the raft,
one of the pontoons.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.011
Stop paddling.

34:16.096 --> 34:20.725
Hey, stop it! You're putting a strain on
the vines. It's going to break us up.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.353
Damn it, you're gonna sink us!

34:26.773 --> 34:28.107
Sawyer!

34:31.152 --> 34:33.487
- Climb up!
- I do and we both sink.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.784
I'm going for the pontoon.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.750
Don't be an idiot.

34:47.293 --> 34:50.755
You see that toothy son of a bitch,
you aim and squeeze. Got it?

34:50.839 --> 34:52.005
Got it.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.150
Come on! Come on, come on!

35:37.302 --> 35:45.684
Sawyer!

35:56.029 --> 35:58.322
Gimme your hand!

36:26.184 --> 36:28.352
There he is. Do you see him?

36:29.396 --> 36:30.521
Hi.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.359
- Hey.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

36:35.443 --> 36:39.530
Packing's been a disaster and the plane
leaves first thing in the morning.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.157
Sure. No problem.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.457
Hey, do you wanna say hi, Walt?

36:51.585 --> 36:53.794
Hi, Walt. I'm...

36:55.797 --> 36:57.715
I'm...

36:59.885 --> 37:04.346
Hey, this is for you, man.
He like bears?

37:05.098 --> 37:07.975
Yes. Sure. He's just really shy.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.564
Hey, little man.

37:13.648 --> 37:19.069
Well, I guess I can't call you that,
I mean, because look how big you are.

37:20.780 --> 37:26.327
So you and I, we're not gonna
see each other for a while, Walt.

37:28.788 --> 37:32.833
But you are gonna have a great life.

37:34.085 --> 37:38.339
I know your mommy, she's going
to take real good care of you.

37:39.925 --> 37:44.011
And Brian is gonna take
good care of you too.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.640
But you know what?

37:47.724 --> 37:53.437
I just want you to know
that no matter where you go, I...

37:56.566 --> 37:58.692
That your daddy...

37:59.945 --> 38:05.032
Yeah, your daddy,
he loves you very, very much.

38:06.368 --> 38:09.036
And I always will.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.332
Always. OK?

38:19.589 --> 38:23.217
- I'm sorry, he's...
- No. It's OK.

38:26.096 --> 38:27.721
It's OK.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.143
Hey, here.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.563
Just, you know...

38:38.108 --> 38:40.693
Let him know it's from me sometime, OK?

38:43.446 --> 38:45.114
OK.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.537
Goodbye, Michael.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.127
Yeah. Bye.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.802
You all right, Mike?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.809
It's my fault.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.229
What?

39:59.814 --> 40:02.191
I never should have brought him
on the raft.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.035
I'm gonna get him back.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.251
I'm gonna get back my son.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.644
How about that?

40:40.772 --> 40:43.023
Current brought us back.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.362
We're home.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.386
Jin?

41:15.515 --> 41:17.641
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

41:31.447 --> 41:36.368
- Others! Others!
- What?

41:36.452 --> 41:38.078
Others.
