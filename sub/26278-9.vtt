01:26.655 --> 01:28.521
Whiskey please, bartender.

01:36.010 --> 01:37.657
Thanks.

01:44.524 --> 01:46.291
Hear you're looking for Nomi.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.639
Straight to the point.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.958
- How'd you hear that?
- Doesn't matter.

01:52.433 --> 01:53.864
What matters is...

01:53.989 --> 01:57.349
do you want to know where she is or not?

01:57.749 --> 01:59.227
Yes, I do.

02:01.281 --> 02:04.291
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

02:09.431 --> 02:11.187
So how much do you want?

02:14.100 --> 02:17.339
- Go home.
- No. Not until I find her.

02:17.392 --> 02:19.452
Well... That's the wrong answer.

02:30.691 --> 02:33.840
That's enough.

03:15.189 --> 03:18.133
Thomas! Good Lord!

03:18.779 --> 03:20.310
Are you all right?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.391
Come in, come in.

03:23.340 --> 03:25.961
Come on. Come on!

03:27.087 --> 03:28.784
I need a drink.

03:32.530 --> 03:35.893
- I found out something.
- What?

03:37.093 --> 03:39.767
I think our daughter is still alive.

03:48.957 --> 03:51.493
_

04:11.953 --> 04:13.714
Thomas Brackenreid.

04:14.018 --> 04:17.305
Sarah Johnston. It is you.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.589
- How many years has it been?
- Almost twenty.

04:21.069 --> 04:22.543
You look well.

04:23.050 --> 04:25.243
You were never much of a liar.

04:31.194 --> 04:33.382
- Shall we?
- Sure.

04:36.494 --> 04:40.385
- Um... Some tea?
- Why not?

04:47.205 --> 04:49.900
Friendly crowd.

04:50.025 --> 04:52.488
No better than a lot of places.

04:58.092 --> 05:01.811
So... How is your life in Toronto?

05:01.849 --> 05:05.077
Until now, uncomplicated.

05:06.492 --> 05:09.475
- I'm sorry for this.
- For what?

05:11.119 --> 05:13.056
For this.

05:20.502 --> 05:22.674
Her name is Nomi Johnston.

05:23.645 --> 05:25.439
She's my little girl.

05:27.179 --> 05:28.998
And she's missing.

05:30.823 --> 05:32.963
I'm sorry, Sarah.

05:35.450 --> 05:37.777
And she is your daughter.

05:39.352 --> 05:40.953
It's the truth.

05:41.828 --> 05:44.181
I would not lie to you about this.

05:45.830 --> 05:48.280
You have to help me find her.

05:49.246 --> 05:50.831
No, I don't.

05:50.885 --> 05:53.034
I've no one else to turn to.

05:53.159 --> 05:55.004
Neither does she.

05:55.794 --> 05:58.078
We're not talking about this here.

05:58.321 --> 05:59.846
Come on.

06:00.716 --> 06:02.445
Come on.

06:06.015 --> 06:07.904
You say she's been missing a month?

06:08.029 --> 06:10.376
- You told the local police?
- Of course.

06:10.392 --> 06:11.758
What did they do?

06:11.843 --> 06:15.020
They looked around for a couple
of days, asked a few questions.

06:15.089 --> 06:17.597
- Then they stopped.
- Did they find anything?

06:17.629 --> 06:19.614
If they did, they
never told me about it.

06:19.739 --> 06:22.299
Well, if they can't find
her, why do you think I can?

06:22.326 --> 06:23.799
I have to hope.

06:24.348 --> 06:25.875
I don't know this town.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.845
I don't even know you. Or her.

06:27.893 --> 06:30.337
- I don't even know if any of this is true.
- It is.

06:30.364 --> 06:32.808
Even if it is true, why
should it matter to me?

06:32.878 --> 06:35.845
Once upon a time we meant
something to each other.

06:35.893 --> 06:38.428
Once upon a time is a long time ago.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.489
Are you not coming?

06:44.624 --> 06:46.497
I can't help you.

06:47.954 --> 06:49.769
Please.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.186
I'm going home.

07:01.787 --> 07:03.570
Sod it.

07:08.848 --> 07:10.630
And his bag is gone.

07:10.657 --> 07:12.845
It's not like him at all
to just get up and leave.

07:12.861 --> 07:15.786
- Well, he did go off to the Amazon that time.
- Panama.

07:15.845 --> 07:19.346
This is different. He took
off in the middle of the night.

07:19.394 --> 07:23.093
He left me a note saying that
he was working on something.

07:23.163 --> 07:25.639
- Then he is.
- And what is it?

07:25.681 --> 07:28.687
Mother! I told you not to come in here.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.574
I don't care what you told
me. And I am your mother.

07:31.601 --> 07:33.560
Look, if he left, he did for a reason.

07:33.576 --> 07:36.320
- And he will come back.
- Your son is right.

07:36.736 --> 07:39.425
Mrs. Brackenreid, you can go home.

07:39.447 --> 07:41.480
I am sure the Inspector
will call in presently

07:41.496 --> 07:43.354
and the moment he does,
we will notify you.

07:43.386 --> 07:46.919
Go home, mother, it
will be fine. Please.

07:47.106 --> 07:49.070
Would you like your son to escort you?

07:50.789 --> 07:53.549
I can make my own way home, thank you.

07:58.036 --> 08:00.422
John, don't worry about your father.

08:00.449 --> 08:02.477
I'm sure everything will be all right.

08:03.501 --> 08:05.017
Thank you, sirs.

08:16.465 --> 08:18.248
Scotch, please.

08:22.715 --> 08:24.316
Could I have another?

08:24.561 --> 08:27.294
- This is the last one.
- Well, you're right about that.

08:27.336 --> 08:28.863
Until the next one.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.014
Young lady, can I have a word?

08:32.268 --> 08:34.323
You can meet me at
Camille's if you'd like.

08:34.366 --> 08:37.446
- I've finished working for today.
- I have a question for you.

08:38.321 --> 08:40.696
Have you ever seen
this young girl before?

08:42.073 --> 08:43.525
No.

08:43.717 --> 08:46.225
- Tell me the truth.
- I said no.

08:46.350 --> 08:47.935
You think we all know
each other? Is that it?

08:47.959 --> 08:49.390
No, I think you're lying.

08:49.657 --> 08:52.703
- Leave me alone.
- I will, when you tell me the truth.

08:53.463 --> 08:56.114
You will leave her alone now.

08:56.633 --> 08:58.764
You and your friends, get out.
You've had enough for the night.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.106
- But he was...
- Hey!

09:00.128 --> 09:01.665
We just got here!

09:06.356 --> 09:07.749
Wait for me.

09:08.571 --> 09:11.287
- You too.
- When I'm ready.

09:11.656 --> 09:13.678
I'm looking for this young girl.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.333
Has she ever been in here?

09:15.387 --> 09:17.442
If you're looking for a
floozy, you won't find one here.

09:17.463 --> 09:18.781
I'm not.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.761
Her name is Nomi Johnston,

09:20.787 --> 09:23.963
she's been missing about a month.
Now please, take another look.

09:28.073 --> 09:30.890
She might have been in here
once or twice. I don't know.

09:38.274 --> 09:39.542
Thomas!

09:39.616 --> 09:41.084
If you want me to help,

09:41.286 --> 09:44.179
I need to know everything
there is to know about Nomi.

09:44.723 --> 09:46.260
Thank you.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.534
I haven't done anything yet.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.960
<i>She would never be in a
bar. Or any public house.</i>

09:58.232 --> 10:01.082
Her mother was no stranger
to bars and public houses.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.466
I did not raise her to be me.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.499
Perhaps she turned into that anyway.

10:05.624 --> 10:08.304
She did not. She is a good girl.

10:08.694 --> 10:12.896
- Good girls don't run away.
- She was taken. She did not run away.

10:12.922 --> 10:15.478
How would you know?
You ran away from me.

10:16.097 --> 10:18.761
- That was different.
- I had to.

10:18.793 --> 10:20.416
Without a bloody word.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.653
I was carrying your child.

10:23.868 --> 10:26.989
What would that have done
to you if I had stayed?

10:27.090 --> 10:30.674
A young man with a black child?

10:31.267 --> 10:33.860
Your life would have been
over before it started.

10:34.264 --> 10:36.389
I left you because I loved you.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.704
You should have told me.

10:40.103 --> 10:42.526
I did what I thought
was best for all of us.

10:42.773 --> 10:45.328
You moved on. So did I.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.980
Does she know about me?

10:48.370 --> 10:51.781
- No.
- And who is that fair to?

10:53.605 --> 10:55.933
It's fair to a ginger haired policeman

10:55.954 --> 10:58.688
who didn't need a bastard
child showing up at his door.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.723
That's who.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.464
- Any news, sir?
- Not as of yet.

11:08.762 --> 11:10.967
Do you think anything
has happened to him?

11:11.805 --> 11:14.602
George, gather as many
Constables as you can.

11:14.612 --> 11:16.538
Check all the train
stations and livery yards.

11:16.539 --> 11:18.225
Someone has to have seen him.

11:20.205 --> 11:22.559
I'm sure there's a
simple explanation, John.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.311
- I'm going as well.
- Of course.

11:28.418 --> 11:30.414
Who is she? Tell me about her.

11:30.713 --> 11:33.590
She was going to be
something. Not like her mother.

11:33.633 --> 11:36.147
You raised a child. On
your own. That's something.

11:36.158 --> 11:38.501
- And now I've lost her.
- Not yet.

11:38.554 --> 11:40.353
Where can I start looking?

11:40.577 --> 11:43.332
She was enrolled in
a secretarial school.

11:43.341 --> 11:46.474
She dreamed about wearing fancy
clothes and working in an office.

11:46.516 --> 11:48.837
It was ridiculous. But she didn't care.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.839
She was going to do it.

11:52.061 --> 11:54.210
Tell me what happened
the day she went missing.

11:54.404 --> 11:57.655
She was on her way to the school.
At least that's what I thought.

11:57.697 --> 11:59.800
When I woke up she wasn't here.

11:59.811 --> 12:02.853
I went to the school and
Mr. Jenkins, her teacher,

12:02.901 --> 12:04.550
said she never showed up.

12:04.609 --> 12:06.381
I told the police right away.

12:06.506 --> 12:09.599
- And they found nothing?
- I already told you that.

12:10.261 --> 12:12.913
They said they looked
everywhere they could.

12:12.951 --> 12:15.011
Then they didn't do anything more.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.032
I talked to everybody she knew,
Tom, but no one knew anything.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.298
It was like she fell off
the face of the earth.

12:31.953 --> 12:34.150
She was an exceptional student.

12:34.251 --> 12:36.137
Miles ahead of all the others.

12:36.586 --> 12:38.357
I liked her dearly.

12:38.789 --> 12:41.894
She had hopes and I had hopes for her.

12:41.925 --> 12:43.533
What does that mean?

12:43.576 --> 12:47.135
I wanted Nomi to make
something of herself.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.212
I had been trying to get her a position.

12:49.430 --> 12:51.784
I made inquiries on her behalf,

12:52.180 --> 12:56.118
people of the right
mind to consider her.

12:56.182 --> 12:59.406
I don't usually do that for my students.

12:59.422 --> 13:01.247
Why did you do it for her?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.412
Because she was black.

13:05.906 --> 13:07.907
Most businesses, they won't...

13:08.151 --> 13:10.341
hire a girl like Nomi, but...

13:10.721 --> 13:12.662
she deserved a chance.

13:12.737 --> 13:17.588
I knew that if the right employer
would just meet with her, they...

13:18.404 --> 13:20.129
they'd take her on.

13:20.658 --> 13:23.132
Did anything unusual happen
on the night she went missing?

13:23.812 --> 13:25.851
Not other than the fact that...

13:25.872 --> 13:27.820
she didn't show up for class.

13:28.439 --> 13:30.139
She never missed one.

13:30.462 --> 13:32.975
I joined the police
to look for her, sir.

13:33.205 --> 13:35.478
I looked every day and night until I...

13:35.603 --> 13:39.482
had to admit to myself
that it was... pointless.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.550
Which of these were her friends?

13:42.903 --> 13:44.611
She didn't have many.

13:44.736 --> 13:48.024
- She must have had some?
- Yes.

13:49.959 --> 13:53.374
That was her desk there.
No one has taken it.

13:53.412 --> 13:56.065
They pray for her
return as much as I do.

14:03.419 --> 14:07.619
She sat next to me for almost a
year. Never missed a day. Until...

14:08.134 --> 14:10.918
Did she say anything to you in
the days before she disappeared

14:10.948 --> 14:14.022
- that struck you as odd?
- No. Not a thing. I've thought about it too.

14:14.641 --> 14:16.328
But she's not dead.

14:16.386 --> 14:17.506
How do you know that?

14:17.702 --> 14:19.124
Because she can't be.

14:19.419 --> 14:20.722
She was going to take on the world.

14:20.739 --> 14:22.439
A person like that just doesn't die.

14:23.048 --> 14:24.581
I'm afraid they do, son.

14:24.816 --> 14:26.271
Every single day.

14:26.814 --> 14:28.697
I looked high and low for her.

14:28.907 --> 14:31.478
I talked to everyone she
knows. There is no one like her.

14:31.568 --> 14:33.390
She was going to be
the next Madame Walker.

14:33.428 --> 14:36.370
- Who?
- The first black lady to make a million dollars.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.091
And Nomi was going to do the same.

14:38.564 --> 14:40.443
Carry a torch for her, did you?

14:42.617 --> 14:45.314
- No, sir.
- Are you sure about that?

14:45.482 --> 14:48.317
- Maybe she rejected you. You got angry.
- No!

14:48.774 --> 14:51.481
I had none of those
kinds of feelings for her.

14:51.908 --> 14:54.876
She... She and I were too much alike.

14:54.910 --> 14:56.529
What's that supposed to mean?

14:57.886 --> 15:00.666
We're both outsiders, sir.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.171
Please don't make me say any more.

15:06.503 --> 15:08.211
I saw you in the bar.

15:08.488 --> 15:10.512
I saw you as well.

15:10.909 --> 15:14.074
Getting fresh with Florence.
I wasn't getting fre...

15:14.428 --> 15:16.112
What were you doing there?

15:16.213 --> 15:18.890
The three of us you
saw, we're taxi dancers.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.117
Colette's Dance Hall across the street.

15:21.218 --> 15:24.495
We sometimes go there for a
drink after we finish work.

15:24.517 --> 15:26.822
If only to get off our feet for a while.

15:26.923 --> 15:29.525
Do you ever get involved
in any funny business?

15:29.576 --> 15:31.612
I keep my nose clean, sir.

15:31.737 --> 15:34.163
I dance only to pay for my schooling.

15:34.187 --> 15:36.549
- Did Nomi ever accompany you there?
- Where?

15:36.596 --> 15:38.291
To the bar. To the dance hall.

15:38.308 --> 15:41.475
- To wherever there's funny business.
- Nomi? No.

15:41.501 --> 15:43.358
Then how did she pay for this place?

15:43.529 --> 15:45.378
She worked at a laundry.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.495
I tried to tell her dancing
was easier money, but

15:48.572 --> 15:51.863
she told me her mother would box
her ears if she ever found out.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.657
Were she and her mother close?

15:53.703 --> 15:57.114
Nomi confessed to me she
found her mother overbearing.

15:58.028 --> 16:02.250
I think that's what happens when
ladies have to raise one on their own.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.028
What do you think
happened to your friend?

16:06.476 --> 16:09.475
A good girl like her? Nothing good.

16:09.513 --> 16:12.996
You drop your guard and the
whole world will swallow you up.

16:14.055 --> 16:16.928
Or it gets too much for
you and you say goodbye.

16:17.355 --> 16:18.819
Would she do that?

16:21.082 --> 16:23.712
To everyone she kept a brave face...

16:26.216 --> 16:29.610
... but she despaired she would
never get anywhere in this world.

16:33.753 --> 16:35.658
She was a good worker.

16:35.683 --> 16:38.752
- Many customers like her.
- Not all?

16:39.446 --> 16:43.135
- Some of the wives didn't.
- They have good reason?

16:43.193 --> 16:45.168
She was a pretty girl.

16:45.189 --> 16:49.838
And... old wives don't
like pretty girls.

16:50.147 --> 16:52.451
I know that only too well, Mr. Lee.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.398
Which of the husbands had a
particular interest in her?

16:55.845 --> 16:58.115
There was a man fond of her.

16:58.145 --> 16:59.359
What was his name?

17:00.375 --> 17:01.835
Doctor Stanfield.

17:02.219 --> 17:04.435
And how did he show this fondness?

17:04.854 --> 17:08.846
He brought his laundry here every
week so he could talk to her.

17:08.971 --> 17:10.759
Did Miss Johnston like him?

17:11.570 --> 17:13.731
He promised her a new life.

17:13.773 --> 17:15.699
What is not to like about that?

17:17.685 --> 17:19.234
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

17:24.653 --> 17:26.326
Yes, I know who she was.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.242
Worked at the laundry
that cleans my shirts.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.561
- So you know she went missing.
- Ran off is more like it.

17:31.830 --> 17:33.422
Why would you say that?

17:34.332 --> 17:36.061
Why should I answer you, sir?

17:36.151 --> 17:39.121
Because I'm a police officer.

17:39.635 --> 17:41.185
Now why do you think she ran off?

17:41.245 --> 17:43.780
- She was that type of girl.
- What type of girl?

17:43.866 --> 17:45.612
Big for her britches.

17:45.737 --> 17:49.642
- And no angel. Ha! Ha! Ha!
- I've heard the same said about you.

17:52.086 --> 17:53.826
You watch your words, sir.

17:54.130 --> 17:57.209
We're only having this
conversation because I choose to.

17:57.268 --> 17:59.910
Do you have any idea where
she may have run off too?

18:00.123 --> 18:03.278
Certainly not. I am not the
type of man who associates

18:03.294 --> 18:05.167
with people of low character.

18:05.391 --> 18:07.264
And she is of low character?

18:07.483 --> 18:10.386
Yes. As is most of her race.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.478
I don't care for that kind of talk.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.066
I'm not concerned about what
you care or care not for.

18:15.109 --> 18:16.624
So you won't help me.

18:17.371 --> 18:18.898
I can't help you.

18:23.173 --> 18:26.781
But you might want to visit an
establishment called the Raven's Ledge.

18:27.053 --> 18:30.085
It opens when the
decent are safely in bed.

18:31.189 --> 18:32.822
Shall we?

18:45.743 --> 18:47.841
Whiskey please, bartender.

18:54.955 --> 18:56.460
Thanks.

19:00.852 --> 19:02.651
Hear you're looking for Nomi.

19:06.322 --> 19:09.778
- I found out something.
- What?

19:10.112 --> 19:12.567
I think our daughter is still alive.

19:18.006 --> 19:20.242
Why do you think that?

19:20.367 --> 19:23.092
Someone sure as hell
doesn't want me to find her.

19:23.444 --> 19:25.260
Or find out who took her.

19:25.445 --> 19:27.126
Or killed her!

19:27.931 --> 19:30.088
I need be honest with you, Sarah.

19:31.145 --> 19:33.936
She may not be the kind
of girl you think she is.

19:34.710 --> 19:36.401
You don't say that.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.540
Have you heard of the Raven's Ledge?

19:40.282 --> 19:42.070
I've heard.

19:42.508 --> 19:45.155
It was people from
there who did this to me.

19:45.689 --> 19:47.439
They knew her.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.954
Maybe they were just
trying to scare me off or...

19:52.055 --> 19:54.564
or get me to stop looking for her.

19:55.058 --> 19:56.933
I don't know.

20:01.726 --> 20:03.732
You are not leaving!

20:05.584 --> 20:07.095
Sit.

20:10.468 --> 20:12.203
I'm gonna clean you up.

20:26.061 --> 20:28.351
I didn't mean to wake you.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.299
It's all right.

20:30.705 --> 20:32.375
How are you feeling?

20:32.567 --> 20:33.987
Well...

20:34.067 --> 20:37.697
I wish I could say you
should see the other fellow.

20:37.931 --> 20:40.696
Still strong as brass.

20:41.123 --> 20:43.439
A little tarnished.

20:55.090 --> 20:57.108
Thank you for coming.

20:58.138 --> 21:00.321
I really didn't know where else to turn.

21:01.031 --> 21:03.225
If she's alive, I'll find her.

21:05.289 --> 21:07.629
She gets a lot from you I think.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.625
- Like what?
- She's stubborn.

21:11.662 --> 21:13.669
Some would call her pigheaded.

21:14.069 --> 21:17.240
But she knows right
from wrong. I know that.

21:19.215 --> 21:21.143
How do you know that's me?

21:22.091 --> 21:24.146
Because that's who you were

21:24.984 --> 21:28.250
all those years ago and still are.

21:30.913 --> 21:32.311
Sometimes...

21:32.978 --> 21:35.357
I think I made a bad decision.

21:37.884 --> 21:40.360
I should have been selfish.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.665
You never really gave me a chance.

21:44.934 --> 21:46.978
No, I didn't.

21:47.661 --> 21:52.018
And in all these years I've
never met another like you.

22:00.029 --> 22:01.689
Sarah?

22:04.091 --> 22:07.475
Sarah, don't. Come on.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.826
No. No.

22:19.068 --> 22:21.470
I have a different life now.

22:21.571 --> 22:24.345
I have a wife. Two good
sons. I'm happy in it.

22:25.860 --> 22:27.723
I know. I just...

22:27.995 --> 22:30.056
I feel so alone.

22:30.079 --> 22:32.046
And if Nomi's gone...

22:32.580 --> 22:34.272
If she's alive,

22:34.742 --> 22:36.316
I'll find her.

22:52.882 --> 22:55.108
- Closed.
- I don't care.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.475
- I was in here last night.
- Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

22:58.806 --> 23:02.673
I was standing right there. A man
came and spoke to me. Who was he?

23:04.888 --> 23:06.435
How would I know?

23:08.235 --> 23:09.708
Who was he?

23:10.241 --> 23:12.862
If I had any idea I'd tell you.

23:13.529 --> 23:16.458
- Don't lie to me.
- I have no reason to lie.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.129
I'd never seen that man before.

23:18.161 --> 23:20.141
Just like I'd never seen you before.

23:20.578 --> 23:23.984
And so you know, what you two do
to each other matters nothing to me.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.100
Take your hands off my shirt.

23:33.744 --> 23:35.249
Constable Crabtree!

23:35.324 --> 23:38.019
- John, I'm afraid I haven't heard anything yet.
- I have.

23:38.035 --> 23:39.667
Someone spotted a man
who looked like my father

23:39.689 --> 23:42.010
- boarding a train a few days ago.
- "Looked like"?

23:42.021 --> 23:44.912
I know, I know. But the train
was heading to St. Mary's.

23:44.935 --> 23:46.566
- And?
- My father was stationed there

23:46.587 --> 23:48.052
for a short time, back
before he met my mother.

23:48.069 --> 23:49.768
I'll wager that's where he is.

23:49.802 --> 23:52.455
- There's a lot "ifs" here.
- I know, but...

23:53.065 --> 23:54.372
I have to go.

23:54.497 --> 23:56.183
You're sure your mother
doesn't need you here?

23:56.207 --> 23:58.965
She might, but what if
my father needs me more?

24:00.097 --> 24:02.304
- John...
- Don't try and stop me.

24:02.329 --> 24:04.750
John! Don't do anything stupid!

24:07.855 --> 24:09.055
What happened?

24:10.062 --> 24:11.706
Look at this.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.482
"I'm well.

24:17.567 --> 24:20.159
I'm leaving town so
please stop looking for me.

24:20.184 --> 24:22.464
It will only end badly
if you do. Love, Nomi."

24:22.537 --> 24:23.959
When did this arrive?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.614
When I came home from
work, it was in my door.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.509
There's no postmark.
Probably hand delivered.

24:29.966 --> 24:31.345
Did the neighbours see anyone?

24:31.353 --> 24:33.911
- If they did, they're not saying.
- Would they lie?

24:33.970 --> 24:35.221
I don't think so.

24:35.396 --> 24:38.286
- They know what she means to me.
- "I am leaving town."

24:38.312 --> 24:40.323
That's good news. That
means she's still here.

24:40.409 --> 24:43.547
It doesn't mean anything.
That is not her handwriting.

24:43.572 --> 24:47.471
- Are you sure?
- I taught her myself! I'm sure.

24:50.725 --> 24:52.172
"J.S.S."?

24:56.250 --> 24:58.863
Uh... Jenkin's Secretarial School?

24:59.191 --> 25:00.600
I'll be back.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.705
Why didn't you tell me?

25:03.786 --> 25:05.763
Because you would have
told him not to go.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.918
- Am I wrong?
- He's a boy.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.267
He's a decent copper,
sir. And sir, his...

25:10.297 --> 25:12.052
His father is missing.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.814
I mean, I don't know if I could
have stopped him even if I wanted to.

25:14.865 --> 25:17.354
Why does John think his
father's gone to St. Marys?

25:17.380 --> 25:19.411
He said something about the
Inspector spending time there

25:19.415 --> 25:22.225
- as a younger man. Should we go?
- No.

25:22.712 --> 25:24.346
- No?
- No.

25:24.518 --> 25:26.786
If the Inspector had wanted
us to know about this,

25:26.795 --> 25:28.153
he would have told us.

25:28.191 --> 25:30.018
He has his right to privacy.

25:30.035 --> 25:32.418
- Sir, I've just let his son go.
- You did.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.258
I wouldn't have.

25:35.061 --> 25:38.648
- Do we tell Mrs. Brackenreid?
- We shall tell nobody.

25:39.451 --> 25:41.654
I'll telegraph the police there

25:41.667 --> 25:44.924
to ensure nothing has happened
to him, but we stay here.

25:47.550 --> 25:48.932
- Sir?
- You heard me, George.

25:48.962 --> 25:51.320
Sir, I... I disagree with this.

25:51.486 --> 25:53.177
And I have heard you.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.913
This letter came from this school.

26:03.464 --> 26:04.975
I... I didn't write it.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.849
I never said you did.

26:07.349 --> 26:10.210
I want handwritten samples
from every one of your students.

26:10.219 --> 26:11.819
This paper could have
come from anywhere.

26:12.093 --> 26:14.980
- From their houses, the suppli...
- Everyone.

26:15.105 --> 26:16.747
This is good news, isn't it?

26:17.383 --> 26:19.407
This could mean that Nomi is alive.

26:20.189 --> 26:22.183
Or it may just be an
attempt to call me off.

26:22.209 --> 26:23.476
Are you that type?

26:26.529 --> 26:28.711
I find out you're hiding anything,

26:29.035 --> 26:30.918
you'll find out everything

26:30.952 --> 26:32.754
you need to know about me.

26:39.981 --> 26:42.978
Oh, excuse me. Can you help me?

26:44.016 --> 26:45.425
Well,

26:45.959 --> 26:49.528
it seems clear the girl
does not want to be found.

26:50.433 --> 26:52.265
- And that's that?
- Well...

26:53.567 --> 26:56.637
I mean, the girl is of legal
age. She can do as she pleases.

26:56.762 --> 26:58.340
And what if she didn't write the letter?

26:58.353 --> 27:00.052
Do you have reason to believe that?

27:00.121 --> 27:03.190
- Her mother thinks she didn't.
- What mother would?

27:03.566 --> 27:05.005
If I were you,

27:05.073 --> 27:07.498
- I would stay out of family business.
- Bloody hell.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.303
It never ends well.

27:10.905 --> 27:12.959
And if the girl is being
held against her will?

27:13.236 --> 27:16.776
Then she couldn't very well have
delivered that letter, could she?

27:17.314 --> 27:19.615
Youngsters all reach to an age

27:19.632 --> 27:22.053
when they never need
their parents anymore.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.982
Both parties seldom
agree on when that is.

27:25.221 --> 27:27.279
What do you know about the
chap who runs the school?

27:27.322 --> 27:29.666
- I know he is a good man.
- And that's it?

27:29.952 --> 27:32.462
I questioned him after
the girl's disappearance.

27:32.587 --> 27:35.254
I'm confident he had no involvement.

27:35.609 --> 27:36.997
What if you're wrong?

27:37.979 --> 27:39.473
I failed her.

27:43.751 --> 27:46.309
Perhaps if I can find out
who wrote that letter...

27:46.373 --> 27:48.349
That's the closest thing
to a clue that we have.

27:50.808 --> 27:52.388
Are you expecting anybody?

27:52.725 --> 27:55.287
No. No one comes here.

28:05.863 --> 28:07.259
Father...

28:11.798 --> 28:14.497
Sarah, pour the boy a drink.

28:14.544 --> 28:16.439
I think he is going to need one.

28:17.793 --> 28:19.257
Come in.

28:21.268 --> 28:23.881
So I have... a sister or something?

28:24.820 --> 28:28.049
Your father knew nothing
about her or any of this.

28:28.471 --> 28:31.225
- On my word!
- That's the truth, John.

28:34.616 --> 28:36.071
So, is she dead?

28:36.605 --> 28:38.129
I don't think so.

28:38.942 --> 28:42.377
Then why not leave her alone?
Isn't that what she said she wanted?

28:42.407 --> 28:44.824
She's my girl. I can't...

28:45.596 --> 28:46.950
Just go home, John.

28:47.035 --> 28:48.845
- Tell your mother...
- Tell her what?

28:48.884 --> 28:50.878
Tell her that I have a sister
that I never knew about?

28:50.891 --> 28:52.106
Is that what you want me to say?

28:52.130 --> 28:54.619
- I know this is a lot to take...
- What? That you are a liar?

28:54.744 --> 28:56.634
- I never knew!
- So you say.

28:58.594 --> 29:01.101
John, Sarah! Get out, now! Go!

29:15.029 --> 29:17.075
They said you could go back inside.

29:17.143 --> 29:18.321
Go with her.

29:36.793 --> 29:38.249
Father?

29:40.426 --> 29:42.143
Let's get inside.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.818
You should just go home.

30:15.681 --> 30:18.771
No. Nomi is alive.

30:18.896 --> 30:20.795
If she wasn't, no one
would have done this.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.554
You're just hoping.

30:25.462 --> 30:27.485
No. What my father says makes sense.

30:27.511 --> 30:29.471
They are trying to scare
us into not looking.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.025
There's something else.

30:33.024 --> 30:34.706
One of the men who beat me up,

30:34.831 --> 30:36.358
I think he was a copper.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.359
What would the police want with my girl?

30:41.239 --> 30:43.942
Maybe she knew something the
police don't want to get out.

30:45.061 --> 30:46.691
Then we're done.

30:47.122 --> 30:48.942
It's one thing to look for my daughter,

30:48.967 --> 30:51.665
another altogether if the
police don't want her found.

30:51.729 --> 30:53.223
Sarah...

30:53.488 --> 30:54.692
Sarah!

30:55.806 --> 30:57.117
It's never done.

30:58.513 --> 31:00.940
Perhaps she was witness to
something the police did?

31:02.389 --> 31:04.213
It might not be the whole force, John.

31:04.559 --> 31:07.403
Maybe someone close to the
police bought himself an officer.

31:07.467 --> 31:09.750
Nomi didn't know anyone like that.

31:10.015 --> 31:11.420
She went to school,

31:11.545 --> 31:14.648
worked in a laundry. She
doesn't know anyone important.

31:14.691 --> 31:16.050
You might be wrong.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.905
John, first thing tomorrow morning,

31:18.952 --> 31:21.339
go to the secretarial school
I was telling you about.

31:21.403 --> 31:24.058
There's some handwriting
samples I need you to collect.

31:26.697 --> 31:28.401
What about tonight?

31:33.776 --> 31:35.617
That's the man I was talking about.

31:36.112 --> 31:37.751
I've seen him.

31:38.003 --> 31:40.019
- No!
- Why not?

31:40.023 --> 31:41.773
You confront him, we get nothing.

31:41.799 --> 31:44.381
- He hurt Nomi.
- We don't know that.

31:44.411 --> 31:46.469
All we know is that
he might be involved.

31:46.594 --> 31:48.907
If he did anything to her, he'll pay.

31:57.338 --> 31:58.871
Any luck?

31:59.217 --> 32:01.014
No one in this class wrote that letter.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.290
- It was that doctor.
- I don't think so. A woman wrote this. Left handed.

32:04.328 --> 32:07.291
If I was to guess, I would say that
English is not their mother tongue.

32:07.312 --> 32:08.768
How do you know this?

32:09.041 --> 32:11.433
I don't know it. It is a theory.

32:13.572 --> 32:15.332
Didn't you say one of
your daughter's friends

32:15.344 --> 32:18.115
- had an odd sounding name?
- Lydia Jodoworski.

32:18.435 --> 32:20.240
Perhaps she wrote this.

32:20.283 --> 32:21.859
- But she was in the class.
- No, she wasn't.

32:21.876 --> 32:23.808
There is not a single
letter signed with that name.

32:23.832 --> 32:25.514
She never provided a sample.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.164
You taught him well.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.491
It had very little to do with me.

32:34.074 --> 32:36.584
This Lydia may have had something
to do with Nomi's disappearance.

32:36.605 --> 32:39.444
- You said those two were friends.
- She was a dance hall girl.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.848
She hung about with all sorts
of disreputable characters.

32:41.865 --> 32:43.692
This doctor was a
disreputable character?

32:43.713 --> 32:45.242
They come in all guises, John.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.603
Say that Stanfield wanted
to get his hands on Nomi,

32:47.612 --> 32:49.230
maybe Lydia helped that happen.

32:49.273 --> 32:51.326
Steered her to a place
where he could take her.

32:51.451 --> 32:52.680
That's horrible.

32:53.051 --> 32:56.241
You carry on doing this job, you're
going to see a lot more horrible.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.072
No, wait here.

33:03.961 --> 33:06.881
<i>I don't believe it!</i>
They are best friends.

33:08.593 --> 33:10.625
Here's something Lydia wrote.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.559
It's her hand. She wrote the letter.

33:17.684 --> 33:19.741
Every day she was out looking for her.

33:20.189 --> 33:22.175
- Every day!
- Where does she live?

33:22.436 --> 33:25.276
- I should tell the police.
- No, you shouldn't.

33:25.335 --> 33:27.896
You should tell me. And if you don't,

33:28.021 --> 33:30.573
I'll have to assume that
you're mixed up in this somehow.

33:39.291 --> 33:42.122
Should be around this corner.
You're gonna wait outside.

33:42.247 --> 33:45.054
- What if you need help?
- I can handle a young girl.

33:45.259 --> 33:48.252
- And what if someone else is there?
- I'll handle them as well.

33:49.302 --> 33:50.498
That must be it.

33:50.566 --> 33:52.756
Keep an eye out. Be careful.

34:07.734 --> 34:10.112
- Get out of here!
- I will

34:10.663 --> 34:12.340
when I get some answers.

34:12.699 --> 34:15.380
- Where's Nomi Johnston?
- I don't know. Why would I?

34:15.400 --> 34:16.813
Don't play stupid with me.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.025
You sent her mother a note
telling her to back off.

34:19.150 --> 34:20.554
- I didn't...
- Don't lie.

34:20.576 --> 34:21.576
Or you'll be on the first boat

34:21.592 --> 34:24.202
back to whichever hellhole you
came from. Now where is she?

34:24.710 --> 34:27.561
- I don't know!
- Don't lie to me, girl.

34:28.264 --> 34:30.784
Where is she? Where
did she go? Anything.

34:31.178 --> 34:34.136
- I don't know! Leave me alone!
- Don't you turn your back on me!

34:34.158 --> 34:37.047
- This is over when I say it is.
- Let go of her!

34:37.100 --> 34:39.201
Please just let go of her!

34:44.145 --> 34:46.139
He never stopped talking to me.

34:47.377 --> 34:50.998
He'd bring in his laundry and
say terribly wrong things to me.

34:52.402 --> 34:53.858
I smiled.

34:54.670 --> 34:56.197
I needed the work.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.575
He even offered me money
once, but I said no.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.057
What happened?

35:02.262 --> 35:03.995
I was on my way to class,

35:04.120 --> 35:06.208
almost at the door when he appeared.

35:07.510 --> 35:09.854
He grabbed me and tried to pull me away.

35:10.580 --> 35:13.001
I tried to fight with
him but he was too strong.

35:13.126 --> 35:14.910
But then Lydia showed up.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.822
I hit him from behind.

35:17.947 --> 35:20.610
He fell to the ground. He never saw me.

35:20.631 --> 35:22.287
Why didn't you say anything?

35:22.305 --> 35:24.649
- We went to the police.
- Yes, we did.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.625
And you know who was already there?

35:26.672 --> 35:28.137
Archibald Stanfield.

35:28.619 --> 35:32.287
He was telling them he
was attacked. By Nomi.

35:32.412 --> 35:33.978
Didn't you dispute this?

35:34.444 --> 35:36.472
I could tell they were friends.

35:36.638 --> 35:39.033
- I knew who the police would believe.
- You didn't know that.

35:39.050 --> 35:42.138
- Oh, I knew.
- I told her not to say anything more.

35:44.588 --> 35:45.809
Why?

35:47.764 --> 35:49.122
Two months ago,

35:49.242 --> 35:52.103
people from the government sent
two of her friends back home.

35:52.837 --> 35:54.438
For no reason at all.

35:55.193 --> 35:58.208
Besides, between Mr.
Stanfield and myself,

35:58.276 --> 36:00.333
I knew who's side the
police would be on.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.623
You did, did you?

36:01.973 --> 36:03.442
I'm not stupid.

36:04.386 --> 36:06.452
And why are you here anyway?

36:10.201 --> 36:11.657
I'm the police.

36:12.245 --> 36:13.650
And I'm listening.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.242
So why the letter?

36:16.750 --> 36:18.496
I didn't know she sent it.

36:18.978 --> 36:22.009
- Why did you send it?
- Because she was worried.

36:22.185 --> 36:23.600
And she wouldn't stop looking.

36:23.601 --> 36:25.582
You could never leave
if she kept looking.

36:25.599 --> 36:27.981
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Well, I did.

36:28.032 --> 36:29.492
She needed to stop.

36:29.830 --> 36:32.020
Is that why you tried
to burn her house down?

36:32.041 --> 36:35.004
- What? No.
- Burn her... What are you talking about?

36:36.135 --> 36:38.782
- Oh, Lord! Is Mother all right?
- Yes. She's fine.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.994
- Take me to her.
- The police will arrest you.

36:41.015 --> 36:42.762
I don't care. I'm going.

36:43.881 --> 36:45.657
And who are you anyway?

36:48.313 --> 36:50.768
I think that's a question
that your mother should answer.

37:07.236 --> 37:08.564
Nomi!

37:09.247 --> 37:10.571
Nomi!

37:10.972 --> 37:12.372
Nomi!

37:16.168 --> 37:17.757
I'm sorry, Mother.

37:17.945 --> 37:20.079
You're safe. You're safe!

37:20.365 --> 37:22.202
Get these two to a hotel.

37:22.327 --> 37:25.442
- Where are you going?
- Less you know the better, son.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.308
- You again.
- The way I see it,

37:35.355 --> 37:37.260
you got some of your boys to beat me up,

37:37.486 --> 37:38.911
now you get the same back.

37:38.976 --> 37:41.847
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You sent me to that bar.

37:41.972 --> 37:43.928
You sent some men to warn me off.

37:45.657 --> 37:48.159
- Try proving that.
- I can't,

37:48.381 --> 37:50.554
especially considering
one of them's a copper.

37:50.679 --> 37:54.212
- Then perhaps you just best go home.
- Oh, you think so?

37:54.999 --> 37:58.385
- You lay one hand on Nomi Johnston again...
- Again?

37:58.810 --> 38:01.980
I know what you bloody well
did. You tried to violate her.

38:02.002 --> 38:05.000
- So she says.
- Well, I found her and I believe her.

38:05.039 --> 38:07.063
And the way I see it is
you know that's the truth,

38:07.085 --> 38:09.801
that's why you've been looking so
hard for her. Because you're scared.

38:09.813 --> 38:12.401
- Scared?
- Then why didn't you want me looking for her?

38:12.435 --> 38:13.895
You wanted that so much

38:13.917 --> 38:16.042
you even tried to burn
her mother's house down.

38:16.346 --> 38:18.835
- Prove it!
- I can't.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.268
And that's the stupid
thing about all this.

38:21.294 --> 38:22.792
You didn't have to do any of it.

38:23.236 --> 38:25.670
No one's gonna take the word
of a coloured girl before yours.

38:25.696 --> 38:27.745
No one except me.

38:30.643 --> 38:31.806
What do you want?

38:31.831 --> 38:34.214
I want you to leave her
and her mother alone.

38:34.339 --> 38:37.189
They say nothing. You say nothing.

38:37.753 --> 38:39.350
If I do that,

38:40.088 --> 38:41.518
is it done?

38:41.681 --> 38:42.910
Not quite.

38:43.316 --> 38:46.237
- You're the law!
- Not here. Not in this town.

38:46.263 --> 38:48.346
Right now, I'm just a father.

38:56.452 --> 38:58.787
If I knew I had a child, I
never would've abandoned her.

38:59.650 --> 39:02.424
And if you did, would you
have married Miss Johnston?

39:02.979 --> 39:04.688
I suppose I would have.

39:06.251 --> 39:08.985
- What?
- Then there never would have been me.

39:10.753 --> 39:12.593
So what do you say to Mother?

39:12.897 --> 39:15.266
Before I knew about the girl,
I would have said nothing.

39:15.283 --> 39:16.321
But now,

39:17.115 --> 39:18.306
I don't know.

39:18.738 --> 39:20.467
How do you think she'll take it?

39:20.809 --> 39:22.564
Just give me a minute, John.

39:23.226 --> 39:25.276
You will be getting on the train?

39:25.489 --> 39:26.848
Of course I will.

39:39.054 --> 39:41.273
My mother said you didn't know about me.

39:42.051 --> 39:43.511
I believe her.

39:43.797 --> 39:44.958
Thank you.

39:45.765 --> 39:48.695
Everyone I've talked to about you
says you are a fine young woman.

39:48.972 --> 39:51.151
Ambitious. Clever.

39:51.236 --> 39:54.003
I'm all of those things.

39:56.065 --> 39:58.357
It's a little hard to believe, isn't it?

40:01.009 --> 40:02.768
Will I ever see you again?

40:03.891 --> 40:05.236
Depends on what you want.

40:05.710 --> 40:07.547
But if you ever do need any help,

40:07.747 --> 40:09.037
I'll be there.

40:11.650 --> 40:13.366
Mother never said anything about you

40:13.379 --> 40:16.167
except that you were a fine man.

40:16.342 --> 40:19.929
- You're mother's a liar.
- Let me make my own judgments.

40:30.488 --> 40:31.936
Good?

40:46.150 --> 40:47.644
Thanks.

40:59.461 --> 41:01.537
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.402
You didn't need to know.

41:04.039 --> 41:07.125
I didn't need to know
that you had a daughter?

41:08.885 --> 41:11.613
I only found out myself
a couple of days ago.

41:12.467 --> 41:14.966
And this other woman, what about her?

41:15.679 --> 41:17.310
She's from my past.

41:17.510 --> 41:19.039
I'm entitled to one.

41:19.713 --> 41:23.051
She whistles and you run to her.

41:23.590 --> 41:25.577
Her child was missing, Margaret.

41:25.594 --> 41:27.959
You didn't know that
when you went to her.

41:29.590 --> 41:31.913
You just left me without a word.

41:33.130 --> 41:35.030
Maybe I didn't want a scene like this.

41:35.043 --> 41:36.597
A scene?

41:36.669 --> 41:39.645
That's what you think this is? A scene?

41:40.144 --> 41:41.745
You lied to me.

41:43.351 --> 41:44.789
I just didn't tell you everything.

41:44.815 --> 41:47.381
That's the same thing
as a bloody lie, Thomas.

41:47.958 --> 41:49.478
What do you want, Margaret?

41:52.181 --> 41:53.390
I...

41:54.697 --> 41:56.447
I want you to leave.

42:23.345 --> 42:25.501
Why'd you let my son go down there?

42:27.064 --> 42:29.583
George didn't tell me that
John knew where you were

42:29.592 --> 42:31.671
until it was too late to stop the boy.

42:32.695 --> 42:34.966
He's got some brass in
him, I'll give his that.

42:35.424 --> 42:37.314
Helped sort out the whole mess as well.

42:37.899 --> 42:40.495
It's a good thing he's learning
from you and not his old man.

42:41.524 --> 42:43.498
Thank you for keeping my confidence.

42:44.541 --> 42:46.578
I would expect the same from you.

42:48.990 --> 42:51.518
And the child? She's yours?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.413
Oh, yes.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.911
Bright lass. And no,

42:56.351 --> 42:57.926
I never knew a thing about her.

42:58.712 --> 43:00.057
If I had...

43:00.775 --> 43:03.558
Oh! My life would have been different.

43:05.788 --> 43:08.204
How did Mrs. Brackenreid
take to the news?

43:08.409 --> 43:09.745
She threw me out.

43:12.085 --> 43:14.732

- She'll get over it.

43:16.099 --> 43:17.209
Yes.

43:17.538 --> 43:18.900
I'm sure she will.

43:22.978 --> 43:25.001

43:26.808 --> 43:28.575
It's been a hard couple of days.
