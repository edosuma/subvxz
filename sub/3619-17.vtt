WEBVTT

00:05.527 --> 00:07.007
Ready?Mm-hmm.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.922
Surprise.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.359
Wow.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.447
Isn't it great?

00:12.621 --> 00:13.622
Um...

00:13.796 --> 00:17.843
it's... it's something.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.455
You hate it.
No, no.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.065
I don't hate anything.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.327
It's just, um...

00:23.501 --> 00:26.417
the dining room
and the living room

00:26.591 --> 00:28.419
and, you know, when you
rearranged the kitchen

00:28.593 --> 00:30.639
I did kinda hate that.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.206
Piper, you're always
complaining about what
a mess it is up here.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.991
Yeah, I know, but it's an attic

00:35.165 --> 00:37.080
and it's supposed to be messy.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.822
Sweetie, it's not that I
don't appreciate you helping

00:39.996 --> 00:42.085
around the house,
because I do, really.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.044
It's just, um...

00:44.218 --> 00:46.176
it's just a little much.Well, you know,
I just...

00:46.350 --> 00:48.309
shuffled some things around.

00:48.483 --> 00:51.834
"Shuffled"?
You call this shuffling?

00:52.008 --> 00:54.054
Honey, you built things.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.143
You-you hung things.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.101
You bagged things.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.408
I mean, what is this?

01:00.582 --> 01:02.714
Uh, those are corks.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.499
You know, for the
potion bottles.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.370
You know how you leave 'em out
and they get brittle.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.851
And that doesn't seem
like overkill to you?Ahem.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.724
I'm just trying to help.

01:12.898 --> 01:16.206
I know, honey,
and, um, that's very sweet.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.295
But you know, I kind of liked
the attic messy.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.080
At least I knew
where everything was.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.344
Where did you find that?

01:23.518 --> 01:24.780
Under some
blankets.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.782
Why?

01:26.956 --> 01:29.480
I just... I haven't
seen it in years.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.962
Is it wet?
Um...

01:33.136 --> 01:35.834
well, it needed
some touch-ups.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.359
Have you gone crazy again?

01:38.533 --> 01:39.969
Look, this isn't
easy for me.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.014
I know, sweetie. I know.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.756
You've been a whitelighter,
an Elder, an Avatar...

01:44.930 --> 01:47.411
Don't remind me.The point is

01:47.585 --> 01:49.239
if it's magical, you've done it,

01:49.413 --> 01:52.024
so it's not gonna be easy
to adjust to life without powers

01:52.199 --> 01:54.070
overnight.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.159
And tackling all
these projects is...

01:56.333 --> 01:57.987
a little obsessive.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.423
Well, what am I supposed to do?

01:59.597 --> 02:00.990
Huh? I can't orb.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.210
I can't go to the
Elders for information.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.386
I just want to fit in.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.518
I know.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.172
But brittle corks?

02:09.346 --> 02:12.697
Okay, I guess maybe
that was a little much.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.613
Look, there is no
how-to book on this, okay,

02:15.787 --> 02:17.311
but we're gonna get
through it together.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.487
Besides, this is
what we wanted.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.445
Normal.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.361
I guess I didn't expect
normal to be so hard.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.363
Well, you can't force it.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.931
And you don't need to.
We've got plenty of time.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.115
Demon! Ah!

02:39.289 --> 02:40.769
PIPER:
Oh, no, you don't.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.949
Still think
we've got plenty of time?

02:47.123 --> 02:48.777
[groans]

02:55.958 --> 02:58.003
Did you warn them?

02:58.178 --> 03:00.180
Just as you've instructed.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.143

04:46.764 --> 04:49.332
Trying to ID the demon.

04:49.506 --> 04:50.855
That's not what I mean.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.248
Why aren't you sitting
down? You got hit.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.381
Yeah, but it's just a scratch.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.426
Well, I think this crescent
might be tribal.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.601
You're not listening to me.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.473
You're not vanquishing anybody.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.605
Why not?

05:01.779 --> 05:03.520
Well, for one thing,

05:03.694 --> 05:05.696
because you can't
self-heal anymore.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.220
Hunting demons is too dangerous.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.700
Okay, well, you can't
self-heal either,

05:09.874 --> 05:11.049
and it doesn't stop you.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.486
Yeah, but I can
blow things up.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.444
Yeah... I noticed.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.272
Leo...
Look,

05:16.446 --> 05:17.839
I don't know why you're
making such a big deal

05:18.013 --> 05:19.841
out of this.A demon tried to kill you.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.757
Okay, well, demons try
to kill us almost every week.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.541
What do you want me to do,
go hide in Magic School?

05:24.715 --> 05:25.542
It's a thought.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.109
I was kidding.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.763
Well, I'm not.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.504
Look, it's great that you
gave up your powers

05:30.678 --> 05:32.767
to be with us and everything,

05:32.941 --> 05:34.290
but things are gonna
have to change.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.770
You've only got
one life to live

05:35.944 --> 05:37.641
and I'd like you to
start taking care of it.

05:37.815 --> 05:41.384
Okay... well, I didn't become
mortal to go run and hide.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.212
I'm staying put.
Leo, please.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.387
I made up my mind.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.609
Ow.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.350
Well, I have to
clean it, don't I?

05:50.524 --> 05:51.916
WYATT:
Da-da.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.309
LEO:
Hey, little guy.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.750
Hey. Hey, look.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.012
Everything's okay.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.754
Look, see? It's just
a scratch, okay?

06:03.928 --> 06:06.235
It's nothing.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.068
Oh, come on, come on.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.113
Advanced magical orbing.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.638
Tuesdays or Thursdays?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.468
Busy?

06:21.642 --> 06:23.339
Exactly what I need.
Would you please

06:23.513 --> 06:24.514
throw that at the calendar?

06:24.688 --> 06:26.603
What? No!

06:26.777 --> 06:27.822
Look, a demon...
No, no, no.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.301
You don't understand.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.651
I have been doing
these schedules all week

06:30.825 --> 06:32.348
and I'm going insane.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.132
That's exactly what I need
to make my decisions.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.264
Would you just please
throw it, throw it?

06:35.438 --> 06:37.092
Fine.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.708
Fridays! Brilliant.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.928
I'm glad to see
the future of magic

06:47.102 --> 06:49.234
is in such capable hands.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.497
Just trying to keep
things lively.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.150
What's up?

06:52.324 --> 06:54.457
A demon attacked Leo.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.155
What? Is he okay?

06:57.329 --> 06:58.679
He's fine, but I
need you to scry

06:58.853 --> 07:00.376
with that thing and
then vanquish the demon.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.597
I'd do it myself, but I have
to get home and protect Leo.

07:03.771 --> 07:04.946
Why didn't you
just bring him here?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.643
He's being stubborn.

07:06.817 --> 07:09.124
So I had to set some crystals
to keep him safe.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.821
He let you do this?

07:10.995 --> 07:13.476
He doesn't know.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.436
I think there's something
you're not telling me, missy.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.003
Leo and I are just
having a little trouble

07:19.177 --> 07:21.615
adjusting to him
being human again.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.095
That would be a big adjustment.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.836
We are also gonna have
to adjust to the fact

07:26.010 --> 07:28.273
that he can't heal us anymore.Or himself.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.754
And I don't want
to keep forcing Wyatt

07:30.928 --> 07:32.974
to tap into his powers
before he's ready.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.280
Why not? He healed you before.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.847
Yeah, with some help,
but we can't keep

07:37.021 --> 07:38.327
traumatizing him like that.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.633
I mean, we've got
to find another way.

07:41.765 --> 07:42.853
So, you can handle all this?

07:43.027 --> 07:44.855
Absolutely.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.509
Uh, you might want
to call Phoebe.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.685
That thing is probably
from some sort of tribe.

07:48.859 --> 07:49.773
Got it.

07:49.947 --> 07:50.948
All over it.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.341
Thanks for the help.

08:00.175 --> 08:03.352
I have assembled
my fiercest warriors.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.659
They better be as capable
as you claim.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.357
The Charmed Ones
will be here soon.

08:08.531 --> 08:12.709
The Charmed Ones
are coming here?

08:12.883 --> 08:14.537
As soon as they scry
with your crescent.

08:14.711 --> 08:17.322
Why do you think I told
you to leave it behind?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.586
[laughs]

08:19.760 --> 08:23.590
So you're luring them
into a trap...

08:23.764 --> 08:25.940
to destroy them.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.769
You think I can destroy them
with one small tribe?

08:30.118 --> 08:32.947
No wonder demons always perish

08:33.121 --> 08:34.557
at the hands of those witches.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.518
Well, then what exactly
is your plan?

08:40.650 --> 08:43.044
Your troops and I are
gonna keep them busy

08:43.218 --> 08:44.915
while you return
to the manor

08:45.089 --> 08:47.483
to locate the spiritual
nexus and with it...

08:47.657 --> 08:49.224
the Shadow.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.097
No demon has been able
to harness the power

08:53.271 --> 08:54.446
of the Shadow before.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.144
Don't get ahead
of yourself, Craven.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.494
You're only gonna
find the nexus.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.062
You won't have time
for anything else.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.414
And you're sure
no one will be home?

09:05.588 --> 09:08.896
Well, that's why you wounded
their former whitelighter.

09:09.070 --> 09:12.203
If I know these witches,
and I do,

09:12.377 --> 09:14.466
they're gonna strike back
with the full Power of Three,

09:14.641 --> 09:16.904
but they won't do that
unless Leo is somewhere safe.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.645
So, yes,

09:18.819 --> 09:21.125
the manor will be empty.Well, you see,

09:21.299 --> 09:23.258
I only ask
because it seems that, uh...

09:23.432 --> 09:26.087
those that help you
don't always...

09:27.001 --> 09:29.133
...survive.

09:30.961 --> 09:35.096
But you attacked at
their home and lived.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.141
Few can boast that.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.189
Take your positions.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.321
We're about to have company.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.242
Split infinitive,
I don't think so.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.422
You know, you should
really call before
you do that.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.337
Look, a demon attacked Leo and
Piper wants us to take him out.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.165
You think you have
enough potion?

10:01.339 --> 10:03.124
It's better safe than sorry.
Come on. We should go.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.430
Why do you seem excited
about this?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.911
Well, because we need
to protect our brother-in-law

10:08.085 --> 10:10.305
and because we should
make a statement.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.048
Because I'm really
cooped up in Magic School.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.832
All right, let me
just go tell Elise.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.663
Hey, boss, column's done.
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:20.837 --> 10:21.969
Oh, no, you don't!

10:22.143 --> 10:23.927
This time, I've got
a family emergency

10:24.101 --> 10:25.799
which means I need you to get
the evening edition out.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.192
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. What?

10:28.366 --> 10:29.585
What about Dillard?

10:29.759 --> 10:30.760
Isn't he
your #2 guy?

10:30.934 --> 10:32.153
Richard is out sick.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.590
Okay, but I'm just
an advice columnist.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.113
I mean, surely you're

10:36.287 --> 10:37.985
skipping some rungs
on the ladder here.

10:38.159 --> 10:41.336
Don't sell yourself short,
Phoebe; I have faith in you.

10:41.510 --> 10:42.729
Besides, you owe me.

10:42.903 --> 10:43.947
Just think of all
the times I've covered

10:44.121 --> 10:45.296
for your family
emergencies.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.254
Yeah, but that was different.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.690
How so?

10:47.864 --> 10:48.909
Well, because they
were my emergencies.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.258
[gasps]

10:50.432 --> 10:51.781
So your life is more
important than mine?

10:51.955 --> 10:53.391
No, that's not what I meant.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.566
Good.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.744
I'm sure you'll do
a fantastic job.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.136
Uh...
Phoebe.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.921
Just who
I was looking for.Who are you?

11:01.095 --> 11:02.574
Tom Taylor, copy editor.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.402
Listen, I got to cut Bauer's
column down to 1,500 words

11:04.576 --> 11:05.621
and he's threatening
to kill me.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.928
Give me a sec. Wh...Excuse me.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.756
Phoebe, Elise said
I should talk to you.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.410
Really?
Yeah, it seems we've
oversold an ad space.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.934
Well, okay. Elise...

11:14.108 --> 11:15.152
[clears throat]
Excuse me.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.153
Just...Hi.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.154
Um, yeah, hi.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.069
Um, Phoebe...

11:19.243 --> 11:20.331
Okay.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.332
WOMAN:
Phoebe.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.030
[woman talking]

11:23.204 --> 11:24.466
That's the attic. Very good.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.772
That's where we are right now.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.599
What's this right here?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.123
That's Mommy and Daddy's room,
right.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.167
[squeals]

11:30.341 --> 11:31.691
[giggling]:
Yeah.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.649
Right there, very good.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.564
Hey.

11:35.738 --> 11:36.739
Hey.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.785
Everything all right?Yeah.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.308
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

11:40.482 --> 11:41.875
Well, you know,

11:42.049 --> 11:44.094
seeing as how a demon tried
to k-i-l-l you.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.095
Right.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.184
Uh, well, I'm fine.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.838
Why are you so defensive?

11:49.012 --> 11:50.535
I don't know.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.061
I guess maybe I feel
like I have something to prove.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.933
Leo, I was just trying
to protect you.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.936
I-I know, but you know,
you don't need to.

12:00.110 --> 12:03.897
Yeah, obviously, I do.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.376
Piper, wait.

12:07.639 --> 12:11.687
Okay, me and Mommy have to have
a grown-up conversation, okay?

12:11.861 --> 12:14.516
I'll be right back.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.741
Okay, we have
ten minutes.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.307
What? I told them
I'd be right back.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.266
Well, it's gonna take
what it's gonna take.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.920
Yeah, I know,
but I have a deadline.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.096
Do you know how much work
goes into one edition?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.532
And I can't believe
Elise just dropped...

12:30.706 --> 12:31.968
Phoebe, focus.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.102
Okay, so now
what do we do?

12:35.276 --> 12:37.844
Uh, I don't know.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.324
Greetings.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.065
Zankou.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.153
What are you doing here?

12:43.327 --> 12:44.589
Paige,
what is he doing here?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.026
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.245
Where's your other sister Piper?

12:48.419 --> 12:49.507
Why do you want to know?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.292
I have my reasons.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.772
Okay, look, you know,
we'd love to stay and chat,

12:52.946 --> 12:54.861
but we have business
that we need to attend to.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.863
I know.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.040
It's going to take longer
than ten minutes.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.175
Why are you so mad at me?

13:05.349 --> 13:08.091
Because you're gonna get
yourself killed, that's why.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.094
Okay, well, I, I can,
I can handle myself.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.661
Really?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.445
The way you handled
yourself this morning?

13:14.619 --> 13:17.405
Yeah, uh, you know,
I could have handled that.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.928
How?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.800
You know, I-I would have
thought of something.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.889
Well, I'm so glad you would
have thought of something,

13:23.063 --> 13:25.108
and now I don't
have to worry.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.807
Okay, it was good
that you were there,

13:27.981 --> 13:29.243
but that doesn't
give you the right

13:29.417 --> 13:31.680
to hide crystals
behind my back.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.464
I was just trying
to protect you.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.292
Okay, well, I'm supposed
to protect you.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.817
Is that what all
this is about?It's part of it.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.122
Look, it's my instinct

13:39.296 --> 13:40.645
to protect you, Piper.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.517
You know, and the reason
I don't hide from demons

13:42.691 --> 13:43.735
is because I've never had to.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.172
I realize that.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.608
Okay, well, Wyatt doesn't,
you know,

13:46.782 --> 13:48.044
and now he's seen me get hurt

13:48.218 --> 13:49.698
and I don't want that
to hurt him.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.484
Okay, look, we are going
to get through this.

13:53.658 --> 13:57.053
I know we are, but you yourself
said it was going to take time,

13:57.227 --> 13:59.708
which means
I'm gonna make mistakes,

13:59.882 --> 14:02.842
okay, and when I do,
I need you to be supportive.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.801
You know,
not drown the plants.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.587
Well, I guess we all
have our own ways

14:09.761 --> 14:10.719
of dealing with things.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.199
Guess so.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.596
What are you doing here?

14:21.208 --> 14:22.731
Dining room.I see where he went.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.428
Stay here.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.181
[whispering]:
Wyatt.

14:46.668 --> 14:47.712
Wyatt, get upstairs.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.328
Leo!
[screams]

14:55.329 --> 14:56.460
Ah.

14:56.634 --> 14:57.766
Ah.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.641
[grunting]

15:03.815 --> 15:04.642
Leo?

15:04.816 --> 15:06.470
Yeah.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.428
Are you okay?

15:07.602 --> 15:08.820
Yeah.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.779
No, I don't want
to let Wyatt see.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.215
PIPER:
Honey,

15:12.389 --> 15:14.914
uh, why don't
you go upstairs?

15:15.088 --> 15:16.393
Mommy and Daddy are fine.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.482
Sweetie,
what's the matter?

15:18.656 --> 15:20.484
What is he doing?

15:30.059 --> 15:31.931
LEO:
What just happened?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.499
Uh-oh.

15:43.594 --> 15:44.944
Why is he doing this?

15:45.118 --> 15:46.684
And why now? I have
a paper to put out.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.469
Oh, I'm sure that factored into
his decision-making process.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.210
I don't understand;
how do we go

15:50.384 --> 15:53.604
from a demon attacking Leo
to Zankou attacking us?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.998
Well, maybe because Leo's
mortal, he's making his move.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.352
Don't be shy, ladies.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.355
You knew this day would come.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.791
Take one of these.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.097
Paige, we have to
get back to Piper,

16:08.271 --> 16:09.707
and I have to
get back to work.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.145
I... want to let 'em know
we're in the game.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.757
One sister is still
at the manor.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.280
I know.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.543
I have the other two
pinned down.

16:19.717 --> 16:20.892
[phone rings]

16:21.067 --> 16:22.938
Would you shut
that frigging thing off?

16:23.112 --> 16:25.288
I'm sorry, but you gotta
admire the range, huh?

16:25.462 --> 16:26.811
We're in the Underworld.
That's pretty good.

16:26.986 --> 16:27.856
[phone continues ringing]

16:28.030 --> 16:30.076
You're making this too easy.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.427
[phone continues ringing]

16:39.563 --> 16:40.521
Looking for us?

16:43.872 --> 16:45.352
You missed.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.267
Okay, that's our cue.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.098
[sighs]

16:52.272 --> 16:54.100
So much for your plan.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.104
Gather the remaining tribe.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.020
This may still work.

17:07.591 --> 17:08.810
PIPER:
Wyatt.

17:08.984 --> 17:11.987
You need to make
Mommy and Daddy big again.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.512
Maybe he can't hear us.

17:15.686 --> 17:16.818
Ow!

17:16.992 --> 17:18.080
What happened?

17:18.254 --> 17:19.864
I don't know.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.607
I think Wyatt put some kind of
force field on the doll house.

17:23.781 --> 17:24.913
Wyatt.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.393
Let us out of here.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.438
Yeah, we, we know you were
only trying to help,

17:28.612 --> 17:30.440
but Daddy needs to get
to the hospital.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.225
Shh... you're just
going to scare him,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.749
and that's probably why he put
us in here in the first place.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.403
To protect us.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.926
Great. We're supposed
to be protecting him.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.015
[sighs]
Okay.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.410
Let me handle Wyatt;
this requires a mother's touch.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.020
Wyatt Matthew Halliwell!

17:45.194 --> 17:47.153
You will stop this nonsense
right now!

17:47.327 --> 17:49.590
Wow, first time
you used his full name.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.418
Well, it sounds better
when I'm scolding him.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.420
You know, I-I don't think
he understands what's going on.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.987
All he knows is a demon just
tried to kill his dad again.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.338
Well, I don't understand
why anyone would attack you.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.428
It's not like you're a
threat to anyone anymore.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.951
Well,
what I don't understand:

18:03.125 --> 18:05.519
how does a demon think
the house would be empty?

18:05.693 --> 18:08.478
Well, we're not going to figure
out anything from inside here.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.611
At least the furniture
is comfortable.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.701
You know, for toy furniture.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.007
Where'd you get
this dollhouse anyway?

18:16.182 --> 18:17.139
Grams made it.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.793
She made it?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.664
Well, I didn't know
she was a witch back then,

18:20.838 --> 18:24.364
so obviously she used
some sort of magic.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.280
It's... pretty perfect.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.586
Almost perfect.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.805
[loud walking]

18:30.979 --> 18:32.459
What's that?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.417
Wyatt and Chris,
what are you doing up here?

18:34.591 --> 18:35.592
PIPER:
Paige.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.247
Paige, down here.

18:38.421 --> 18:39.292
Where's your mommy
and daddy?

18:39.466 --> 18:40.858
Huh?

18:41.032 --> 18:41.729
I saw what happened
downstairs.
Paige.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.122
Okay.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.212
Ow!

18:46.386 --> 18:48.170
[groaning]:
Oh...

18:48.344 --> 18:49.650
PAIGE:
All right, babies,

18:49.824 --> 18:50.955
we're gonna go to Magic School

18:51.130 --> 18:53.915
until we can figure out
what happened.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.922
I see he's just as stubborn
as someone else I know.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.541
Well?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.369
The house is clear.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.980
[scoffs]
Yes, well,

19:16.155 --> 19:18.418
that's what you said
the last time.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.637
A slight miscalculation,

19:20.811 --> 19:23.945
but the plan was to get them
out of the manor and they are.

19:24.119 --> 19:27.340
Probably circling their
broomsticks in Magic School.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.690
So I'm going back
for the nexus?

19:29.864 --> 19:32.083
Except this time,
I'm coming with you.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.215
Follow me.

19:43.704 --> 19:47.229
Ah, the Charmed Ones'
ancestral home.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.100
How do we know
this isn't a trap?

19:50.145 --> 19:51.320
We don't.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.017
That's why I asked
for reinforcements.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.324
Give the command.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.847
Spread out.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.066
Find the nexus.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.158
PIPER:
How are we gonna get
out of here?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.116
LEO:
We can't. It's useless.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.250
That's all you've got
for me?

20:08.424 --> 20:09.860
We're just supposed
to sit here

20:10.034 --> 20:11.732
and do nothing while you bleed
to death on the couch?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.864
What do you want me to say?

20:14.038 --> 20:16.258
I can't self-heal anymore.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.259
Without a doctor...

20:17.433 --> 20:19.914
You used to be a doctor.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.046
Yeah, like 60 years ago.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.961
Well, start acting
like one!

20:24.135 --> 20:27.008
Come on, Leo, you have to stop
focusing on what you can't do

20:27.182 --> 20:28.923
and think about
what you cando.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.925
Come on. Improvise.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.014
All right.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.322
Grams used to like to sew,
right?

20:36.496 --> 20:37.845
Yeah...

20:38.019 --> 20:39.847
Where?

20:40.021 --> 20:45.026
Wyatt's bedroom used to be
her sewing room. Why?

20:48.725 --> 20:50.597
Okay.

20:50.771 --> 20:51.902
Now what?

20:52.076 --> 20:53.730
Needle and thread.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.254
Excuse me?

20:55.428 --> 20:57.125
Don't worry.
I'll walk you through it.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.692
Walk me through what?

20:59.780 --> 21:00.650
Oh, no.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.043
No, no, no.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.958
You're the one who said
to improvise.

21:04.132 --> 21:07.657
Well, since when
does anybody listen to me?

21:07.831 --> 21:09.529
You can do this, Piper, okay?

21:09.703 --> 21:12.053
Let's prove to Wyatt we can
handle whatever's thrown at us.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.751
Mm-hmm.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.623
All right, just, uh,

21:16.797 --> 21:18.973
pull the skin together
and stitch it through.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.280
Sure... easy
for you to say.

21:21.454 --> 21:22.281
I'm ready. Do it.

21:22.455 --> 21:23.412
Are you sure?

21:23.586 --> 21:25.109
Hurry.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.636
[groans]

21:29.810 --> 21:31.333
Elise, where have you been?

21:31.507 --> 21:33.379
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.294
ELISE:
That's funny. I've been trying
to avoid you all day.

21:35.468 --> 21:36.773
Oh, that's a good one.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.471
Listen, I kind of
need to get out of here,

21:38.645 --> 21:40.734
'cause there is
a little crisis at home.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.040
Oh it's always life and death
with you Halliwells.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.085
Can I freshen up those

21:44.259 --> 21:45.826
drinks for you?Drinks?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.959
What drinks?Yes, thank you.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.005
Wait a minute. What exactly
did you say your emergency was?

21:51.179 --> 21:52.354
I didn't.

21:52.528 --> 21:55.662
I'm so sorry about that,
Richard.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.404
This moron is trying

21:58.578 --> 22:00.014
to take a butcher knife
to my column.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.538
Okay, well, what seems
to be the problem?

22:02.712 --> 22:04.366
Obviously, besides
the butcher knife.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.715
Phoebe,

22:05.889 --> 22:07.195
like I told you,
it's a great story,

22:07.369 --> 22:09.023
really it is, it's
just a bit bloated.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.067
Bloated?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.504
I'll show you bloated.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.722
No, no, you know what?
Please, please,

22:12.896 --> 22:14.376
please don't.Look, lady,

22:14.550 --> 22:15.551
I've been working the beat

22:15.725 --> 22:16.987
in this town for 22 years,

22:17.161 --> 22:18.859
and no Ivy League
trust funder

22:19.033 --> 22:20.513
is going to tell me
how to write the news.

22:20.687 --> 22:21.992
No...
Fashion editor,
sorry to interrupt.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.167
Uh...

22:23.342 --> 22:25.735
but our so-called film critic

22:25.909 --> 22:27.737
has been drinking coffee

22:27.911 --> 22:29.391
out of my teacup.You know, I don't know

22:29.565 --> 22:31.045
what Jordan's so
worked up about,

22:31.219 --> 22:32.960
it's a two-and-a-half star
coffee mug at best.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.311
Phoebe, uh,
we got to go.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.922
Yeah, I know, I know.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.446
And I want to get Zankou
as much as you do.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.056
Where's Piper?That's the problem.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.449
Piper and Leo have vanished.

22:43.623 --> 22:44.711
What do you mean?
What about the boys?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.103
The boys are fine.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.583
We just have to find
their parents.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.411
Let me ask you a question.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.239
Did we ever push the deadline
for the evening edition?

22:51.413 --> 22:52.283
No.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.024
Then it would be called

22:54.198 --> 22:55.417
the sometime-in-the-middle-
of-the-night edition.

22:55.591 --> 22:56.549
All right,
you know what?

22:56.723 --> 22:58.551
I am going to go
into my office

22:58.725 --> 23:00.857
for a very important
conference call.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.598
No interruptions.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.400
Oh, goodness.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.053
Hope you guys got a discount
on all that leather.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.272
ZANKOU:
That's something

23:24.446 --> 23:26.013
I admire about you ladies.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.233
Always a clever remark
at the face of danger.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.888
Though I'm insulted.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.022
Don't you think I warrant
the Power of Three?

23:35.196 --> 23:37.198
Does he know
where Piper is?

23:37.372 --> 23:38.678
No.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.507
How would he know about
her nail appointment?

23:41.681 --> 23:43.378
Well, you'd think
she'd be at Magic School

23:43.552 --> 23:45.075
attending to her husband.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.948
Yeah, well, she didn't want
to pay the cancellation fee

23:48.122 --> 23:48.949
for the nail appointment.

23:49.123 --> 23:49.863
You're lying.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.387
Somehow "the Power of Two"

23:52.561 --> 23:53.954
just doesn't have
the ring to it.

23:57.087 --> 23:58.001
[yells]

24:04.660 --> 24:05.879
Now what?

24:06.053 --> 24:07.620
LEO:
Tie it off and-and cut it.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.273
Scissors.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.716
Aren't you happy
you became a mortal?

24:16.890 --> 24:19.109
Well, at least
now we can grow old together,

24:19.283 --> 24:20.415
like every other couple.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.025
That is if we
survive this.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.419
Wyatt's so worried he
practically locked us up

24:24.593 --> 24:25.812
and threw
away the key.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.640
Well, I'll just have
to prove to him

24:27.814 --> 24:29.685
that I can take care
of myself and my family.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.774
Yeah, it would help
if we were reinstated

24:31.948 --> 24:33.384
to our former size.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.568
What's he doing here?

24:42.742 --> 24:45.701
Post guards here
and throughout the manor.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.008
As soon as they find their
sister, they'll be back,

24:48.182 --> 24:50.140
and we'll need to fend them off
for as long as possible.

24:50.314 --> 24:51.838
You mean if we're
to find the nexus?

24:52.012 --> 24:53.274
The nexus?
Where are

24:53.448 --> 24:54.710
Phoebe and Paige?

24:54.884 --> 24:56.582
I want more than just
to find the nexus now.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.497
I want to release
the Shadow.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.977
Harness its ultimate power.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.458
Can you do that?Well, now

25:03.632 --> 25:06.505
that evil has taken over control
of the manor, I can.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.510
And I will.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.350
PIPER:
I can't believe
we've been miniature

25:26.525 --> 25:28.483
for two hours and demons
take over the house.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.485
If Zankou taps
into the nexus...

25:30.659 --> 25:32.356
We're not going to
let that happen.
Oh, yeah?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.010
How? We're three inches tall.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.664
Well, we're going
to get to The Book

25:35.838 --> 25:37.231
and we're going to contact
Phoebe and Paige.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.276
Uh... that Book?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.191
'Cause...

25:41.365 --> 25:44.107
A: we're trapped.
And B: even if we weren't,

25:44.281 --> 25:46.196
those demons could squash us
with one foot.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.458
Stay calm.
Oh,

25:47.633 --> 25:49.025
now you're telling me.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.810
Look, Wyatt didn't put us
in here to get hurt.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.507
He put us in here
to protect us.

25:52.681 --> 25:55.075
There has to be something
we're overlooking.

25:55.249 --> 25:57.077
Blasting doesn't work.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.644
Yeah, I noticed.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.776
All the doors,
the windows are sealed.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.952
Listen, how did you play
with the dollhouse

26:03.126 --> 26:04.214
when you were little?

26:04.388 --> 26:05.607
What do you mean?

26:05.781 --> 26:08.305
I mean, I mean, it's,
it's a toy, right?

26:08.479 --> 26:10.743
I think you've lost
a little too much blood.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.092
No, listen to me.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.007
If it's a toy,
it must open somehow.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.270
Either the roof opens up or the
doors swing open or something.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.446
I don't know.
That was a lot of years ago.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.361
Well, it might be our only shot.
You need to think.

26:20.535 --> 26:23.277
I think it swung open.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.366
Where?

26:28.456 --> 26:31.024
Here.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.217
Damn it.

26:50.391 --> 26:51.261
Blast it.

26:51.435 --> 26:52.785
Blasting doesn't work.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.264
Well, maybe the force shield

26:54.438 --> 26:55.614
only covers the windows
and the doors.

26:55.788 --> 26:56.658
So you know...

26:56.832 --> 26:57.790
Do it.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.059
Now what?

27:06.233 --> 27:08.452
Follow me.

27:25.469 --> 27:26.906
I believe we've loc...

27:27.080 --> 27:28.516
Do you have any idea

27:28.690 --> 27:32.302
how upset Piper was
when her sister died?

27:32.476 --> 27:34.740
I'm sorry...Listen to this:

27:34.914 --> 27:36.872
"Prue was always the strong one.

27:37.046 --> 27:40.789
"Now that she's gone, I don't
know if we'll have the strength

27:40.963 --> 27:42.225
"to keep fighting for good...

27:42.399 --> 27:44.140
or if it's even
worth it."

27:44.314 --> 27:45.664
Yes, well, if only...

27:45.838 --> 27:47.578
Humans are slaves
to their own emotions.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.494
And the strongest emotion
is love.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.584
That's why Piper didn't
leave her husband's side

27:53.759 --> 27:54.716
to fight us.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.457
That was my miscalculation.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.589
They would go
through hell

27:58.764 --> 28:00.330
to stay together.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.897
[clears throat]

28:02.071 --> 28:04.770
What is it?

28:04.944 --> 28:07.163
I believe
we have found the nexus.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.311
Oh you got to
give me one sec.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.834
Any luck with Piper?

28:26.008 --> 28:27.706
No, I have scried
the entire universe

28:27.880 --> 28:29.490
and there's no sign of her.
Will you please just come back

28:29.664 --> 28:30.883
to Magic School with me now?Give me just

28:31.057 --> 28:33.233
two minutes.Our sister is missing.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.843
And there are 50 jobs
on the line

28:35.017 --> 28:36.715
if the paper does not come out.Well,

28:36.889 --> 28:38.760
you can cancel
the subscription to our house

28:38.934 --> 28:40.109
if the demons don't get out.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.894
Just give me one minute.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.594
[whistles]

28:48.117 --> 28:49.249
Okay...

28:49.423 --> 28:50.990
check this out.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.731
You think I'm going to let
"Ask Phoebe" rewrite me?

28:52.905 --> 28:54.036
Read now. Bitch later!

28:54.210 --> 28:55.690
Okay?

28:55.864 --> 28:58.084
So you oversold the space.
Let me see the ads.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.086
Shrink 'em and
print them both.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.652
We can't do that.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.219
The advertisers were promised
a certain size.

29:03.393 --> 29:04.612
Well, then make

29:04.786 --> 29:06.135
the font bigger.
And if they complain,

29:06.309 --> 29:08.398
send them a bottle
of Cristal on my tab.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.270
Actually, on Elise's tab.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.141
What do you think?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.143
It works.That's what

29:14.317 --> 29:16.624
I like to hear. Who's next?

29:18.626 --> 29:20.541
First, my teacup.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.108
Now he's on my computer.

29:22.282 --> 29:23.196
You know what?

29:23.370 --> 29:24.458
Isn't this kind of obvious?

29:24.632 --> 29:25.633
What?

29:25.807 --> 29:27.853
He likes you.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.774
Any other questions?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.906
No? Okay.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.735
I will be in my
office in a meeting.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
Oh, can you believe
those guys?

29:43.956 --> 29:46.045
At least they're not
prepubescent.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.568
Paige, Piper, demons.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.835
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

29:54.009 --> 29:54.967
The nexus...

29:55.141 --> 29:56.882
The nexus is neutral,

29:57.056 --> 30:00.711
controlled
by whomever controls the manor.

30:00.886 --> 30:04.759
The Shadow is
the ultimate power.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.283
It could destroy us all.

30:07.457 --> 30:13.115
Well, then if I'm wrong,
it's been a pleasure.

30:20.775 --> 30:24.083
"Natum adai necral...

30:24.257 --> 30:27.782
daya intay layok."

30:43.885 --> 30:45.931
Good must still be present
in the manor.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.671
No, no, no,

30:47.846 --> 30:49.412
that's not possible; you
expelled the witches yourself.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.153
Only two.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.763
That means the third one

30:52.938 --> 30:54.243
must still be here.

30:54.417 --> 30:57.420
That's probably what
they came here for.

30:57.594 --> 31:00.293
So what do we do?

31:01.555 --> 31:03.862
We find her.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.780
Are you okay?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.173
Oh, my arms are
a little sore,

31:11.347 --> 31:12.958
but I'm not the one
with a hole in my back.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.263
All right...

31:14.437 --> 31:15.874
let's tweak the
scrying spell

31:16.048 --> 31:17.614
so Phoebe and Paige
know where we are.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.268
Don't you think
they've scried already?

31:19.442 --> 31:20.313
Well, if they did,

31:20.487 --> 31:22.097
it wouldn't have worked.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.533
Wyatt's shield on the dollhouse
would have protected us.

31:23.707 --> 31:24.970
It must be
the same reason

31:25.144 --> 31:26.406
Zankou didn't know
where we are.

31:26.580 --> 31:27.798
And now that we're out?

31:27.973 --> 31:29.235
We have to hurry.

31:29.409 --> 31:32.542
All right, help me
flip these pages.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.022
Wait. I got a better idea.

31:34.196 --> 31:35.676
What?
Look out.

31:48.950 --> 31:49.951
Think they noticed?

31:50.125 --> 31:51.561
I don't know.

31:51.735 --> 31:52.867
Hope this works.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.956
It has to.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.959
Okay, this whole calling
a lost witch stuff

31:58.133 --> 31:59.613
is much harder
without The Book.

31:59.787 --> 32:00.831
Maybe we didn't
scry hard enough.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.224
Should we try again?

32:02.398 --> 32:03.573
I told you it didn't work.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.227
Okay, okay,
you know what?

32:05.401 --> 32:08.013
It says a pinch of rosemary,
Paige, a "pinch."

32:08.187 --> 32:09.275
Sorry. I just
wasn't paying attention.

32:09.449 --> 32:10.929
Well, I'm glad

32:11.103 --> 32:12.800
to know the future of magic
is in such good hands.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.584
People have been telling me that

32:14.758 --> 32:15.846
a lot lately.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.155
Oh, my God, are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

32:20.329 --> 32:22.984
Yeah, and I don't
believe it.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.160
Wha...
What?

32:25.334 --> 32:27.423
That's our house.

32:27.597 --> 32:28.685
Piper must be there.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.078
Or it's a trap.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.080
Huh, but scrying
is witch-to-witch stuff.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.690
It has to be her.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.475
Okay, but the house is
crawling with demons.

32:35.649 --> 32:36.955
How are we
gonna find her?

32:37.129 --> 32:39.000
One way to find out.

32:39.174 --> 32:41.176
Oh, God.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.625
We've got to get past
the guard.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.888
Fine, but we can't
use any more magic.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.499
Otherwise, Zankou
will sense us.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.762
Can't use magic?
What do you call orbing?

33:01.936 --> 33:04.199
Okay, fine. Then we
won't use any more magic.

33:04.373 --> 33:06.201
I have an idea.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.247
She's here.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.684
She's here.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.904
I know she's not alone.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.341
Speed the search.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.560
We've got company.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.258
Yes.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.609
Yes, sir, but we may have
already found Piper.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.266
[groans]

33:27.440 --> 33:28.832
[groans]
[groans]

33:29.007 --> 33:31.226
Oh!
Okay, that was a
really great plan.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.054
Well, I didn't
use magic, did I?

33:33.228 --> 33:34.273
Where do we begin?

33:34.447 --> 33:37.276
The Book.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.626
[groaning]

33:41.628 --> 33:43.195
Piper, where are you?

33:43.369 --> 33:44.892
[door squeaking,
Phoebe gasps]

33:45.066 --> 33:47.808
Looking for these?

33:59.559 --> 34:00.951
The mighty
Charmed Ones.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.737
The most famous witches

34:03.911 --> 34:04.912
of all time.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.087
So many demons

34:06.261 --> 34:07.262
have tried
to kill you.

34:07.436 --> 34:08.394
What do you see?

34:08.568 --> 34:09.264
Demons.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.526
And now that

34:10.700 --> 34:13.051
the moment is here,
it's almost...

34:13.225 --> 34:14.095
anticlimactic.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.444
Maybe for you it is.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.272
Perhaps you'd like to go first.

34:17.446 --> 34:18.882
PHOEBE:
Hold on.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.494
You need us...
to open the nexus.

34:21.668 --> 34:24.192
Nice try.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.672
Shall I start with you instead?

34:25.846 --> 34:28.631
No, because you need us
to get the Shadow.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.808
I'm listening.

34:31.982 --> 34:32.809
What are they doing?

34:32.983 --> 34:34.159
They're stalling!

34:34.333 --> 34:35.856
Just

34:36.030 --> 34:37.336
kill them, and evil will control
the nexus this time.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.815
PAIGE:
This time?

34:38.989 --> 34:40.556
What do you mean?
You've tried before?

34:40.730 --> 34:42.732
PHOEBE:
I bet they lost
some demons, too.

34:42.906 --> 34:45.431
Yeah, we've had some experience
with the nexus.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.259
They're lying!

34:47.433 --> 34:48.608
ZANKOU:
No.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.871
I read Piper's diary.

34:52.481 --> 34:55.397
I guess I'll need to make her
big again for you to do this.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.399
Zankou, they just
want you

34:57.573 --> 34:59.401
to restore the
Power of Three.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.100
What's that compared to
the power of the Shadow?

35:02.274 --> 35:05.103
So, what isin it for you?

35:05.277 --> 35:06.843
We live to fight another day.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.585
And if we do die, we go down
kicking and screaming.

35:09.759 --> 35:10.717
I'm not leaving you.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.632
You have to.

35:12.806 --> 35:15.025
If Zankou gets the Shadow, then
we'll never be able to stop him.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.679
The Shadow won't know
where to go.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.203
Look, I might have
lost my powers,

35:18.377 --> 35:20.814
but I didn't lose
what I know about magic.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.208
Trust me. Do what he wants.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.001
Hey, put me down!

35:34.175 --> 35:35.611
You try anything...

35:35.785 --> 35:37.135
PIPER:
Damn it! I said
put me down!

35:37.309 --> 35:40.181
And you will lose the love
of your life.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.401
[squeaking, thudding]

35:47.667 --> 35:50.017
Any idea how
we're gonna get
out of this one?

35:50.191 --> 35:52.150
No, but I'm hoping
Leo does.

Proceed.

I told you
we should have killed them.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.083

36:56.257 --> 36:59.869
Never tell me I told you so.

37:07.529 --> 37:08.617
Leo?

37:10.140 --> 37:11.533
Leo, you don't want this.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.056

Say the spell.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.435
Yeah, I'm all right.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.175
What happened?

37:45.350 --> 37:46.438
Well, the Shadow couldn't choose
between Zankou's evil

37:46.612 --> 37:47.830
or the Power of Three,

37:48.004 --> 37:49.963
so it went to the only
neutral territory--

37:50.137 --> 37:51.965
me.

37:52.139 --> 37:54.881
See, I told you it was a good
thing you gave up your powers.
