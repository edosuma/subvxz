00:36.038 --> 00:37.842
Dad, I'm freezing.

00:37.843 --> 00:39.149
Don't worry, kids.

00:39.150 --> 00:42.934
These wool socks and down
parkas will keep you warm.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.407
We wouldn't be in
this trouble if you'd just

00:48.408 --> 00:49.737
paid the heating bill !

00:49.738 --> 00:52.198
I thought global warming
would take care of it.

00:52.199 --> 00:54.342
Al Gore can't do
anything right.

00:54.368 --> 00:56.082
I got some old
magazines to burn.

00:56.365 --> 00:57.720
Popular Science.

00:58.933 --> 00:59.889
Redbook.

Costume catalogue.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.254
Next item.

01:05.339 --> 01:06.252
No ! ! ! ! !

01:11.956 --> 01:14.662
Mom, I didn't know
you went to college !

01:14.675 --> 01:16.442
Yeah, you always said
that after high school,

01:16.445 --> 01:19.670
Dad "blessed" you with
the unplanned miracle of me.

01:19.686 --> 01:23.313
Hey, parents are allowed
to keep some secrets.

01:23.378 --> 01:25.210
Like which kid's
their favorite !

01:25.328 --> 01:26.280
It's Lisa.

01:27.735 --> 01:32.543
You know, Mom and Dad
are almost 40, and Bart is ten.

01:33.455 --> 01:36.370
That means you didn't have him
until way after high school.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.052
Yeah, what happened while
I was chillin' in Dad's junk ?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.060
There is a part of our past that

01:41.067 --> 01:43.223
we haven't told you kids about.

01:43.245 --> 01:45.043
A turbulent part.

01:45.077 --> 01:47.411
Come on.
More turbulent than now ?

01:47.428 --> 01:49.483
We're in every kind of therapy.

01:49.488 --> 01:52.342
Things happened between your mother
and me that we're not proud of.

01:52.366 --> 01:55.962
It was the middle of a wild decade
known as the 1990s.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.741
The '90s ? Never heard of it.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.973
Oh, it was a wonderful time.

01:59.977 --> 02:02.402
The Iraq war was over
once and for all,

02:02.408 --> 02:05.363
a struggling Matt Groening
created Futurama,

02:05.585 --> 02:07.902
and young people
believed in their dreams,

02:07.926 --> 02:11.701
thanks to a TV show
called Melrose Place.

02:12.438 --> 02:13.960
<i>Your mother and I were dating,</i>

02:13.968 --> 02:15.333
<i>and we had just moved into</i>

02:15.336 --> 02:16.940
<i>our first apartment together.</i>

02:21.308 --> 02:23.281
Luann, a picture of
you cheating on me

02:23.288 --> 02:25.020
is downloading
onto my computer.

02:25.046 --> 02:27.871
I'll know who you were with
in less than six hours !

02:27.927 --> 02:29.730
Unless someone
picks up the phone.

02:29.745 --> 02:31.282
No, no, no, no ! Oh !

02:31.915 --> 02:33.463
<i>We didn't have a lot of money,</i>

02:33.468 --> 02:35.271
<i>but we were young and in love.</i>

02:37.208 --> 02:37.990
Oh !

02:37.996 --> 02:40.142
I'm afraid it's
Top Ramen again.

02:40.158 --> 02:41.083
With you, baby,

02:41.085 --> 02:43.661
Top Ramen tastes
like Cup O' Noodles.

02:46.378 --> 02:51.253
You know, these IKEA foam
futons do Velcro together.

02:51.918 --> 02:53.313
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

02:53.326 --> 02:55.152
I'm not ready
to do that yet.

02:55.196 --> 02:56.902
I want to wait
until I'm married,

02:56.918 --> 02:58.210
or at least really drunk.

02:58.287 --> 02:59.211
I understand.

02:59.218 --> 03:02.122
We should follow the lead
of today's celebrity role models.

03:02.136 --> 03:03.791
Sonic The hedghog says
"Wait until marriage".

03:03.875 --> 03:05.252
<i>Like all young people,</i>

03:05.256 --> 03:06.460
<i>I had a musical dream,</i>

03:06.468 --> 03:08.592
<i>a dream called inoffensive urban light</i>

03:08.596 --> 03:10.283
<i>hip-hop smooth grooves.</i>

03:10.288 --> 03:12.723
Okay, everyone,
let's warm up our harmonies.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.220
<i>Homer</i>

03:14.225 --> 03:15.371
<i>Lenny</i>

03:15.378 --> 03:16.333
<i>Carl</i>

03:16.337 --> 03:17.890
<i>Lou the Cop</i>

03:19.996 --> 03:24.811
<i>I'll make rub to you
Show respect for you</i>

03:24.918 --> 03:30.183
<i>Hug so safe and strong
Backrub all night long !</i>

03:30.185 --> 03:32.590
<i>I'll make rub to you !</i>

03:32.608 --> 03:35.473
<i>But our happiness
was about to unravel</i>

03:35.475 --> 03:37.981
<i>just like Kevin Costner's career:</i>

03:37.997 --> 03:40.103
<i>because of the postman.</i>

03:40.575 --> 03:42.031
You applied to college ?

03:42.038 --> 03:43.310
Why didn't you tell me ?

03:43.325 --> 03:44.551
I did tell you.

03:44.568 --> 03:46.420
I thought you were
telling me you wanted

03:46.426 --> 03:48.990
to apply yourself to
making a collage.

03:49.005 --> 03:50.612
And as I recall,
I was against it.

03:50.616 --> 03:52.523
I can't believe I got in.

03:52.527 --> 03:54.503
It's like a dream come true.

03:54.966 --> 03:57.233
An expensive dream.

04:01.376 --> 04:04.002
Oh, baby, you deserve
every last bit of it !

04:04.005 --> 04:05.163
I can get the money,

04:05.228 --> 04:07.841
but it'll mean swallowing
my pride and working for...

04:07.988 --> 04:09.443
my dad !

04:10.476 --> 04:12.173
Well, Well, Well, 

04:12.176 --> 04:15.801
look who's come crawling back
to work for your old man.

04:15.815 --> 04:17.523
What do you need
the money for ?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.123
Medicine ?

04:19.128 --> 04:20.221
None of your business.

04:20.245 --> 04:22.060
Now give me a job
at your business.

04:22.067 --> 04:22.893
You're dead !

04:22.896 --> 04:24.313
Die ! Die ! Die !

04:24.316 --> 04:25.300
Suck my beam !

04:26.745 --> 04:29.192
Okay, all right !
Time's up !

04:35.038 --> 04:36.913
This counts as your break.

04:36.915 --> 04:39.000
<i>But Marge's education was worth</i>

04:39.008 --> 04:41.950
<i>all the pistol-whipping in the world.</i>

04:42.127 --> 04:44.562
This place is just
like the brochure:

04:44.565 --> 04:46.321
Autumn leaves.

04:46.326 --> 04:47.950
Bull sessions.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.271
And that is why

04:49.276 --> 04:51.761
The Lord of the Rings
can never be filmed.

04:51.817 --> 04:54.702
Fraternity pledges
in their beanies.

04:54.735 --> 04:57.821
I think I'm gonna like it here.

05:00.585 --> 05:04.243
So, have you all bought the required
textbooks for this class ?

05:05.196 --> 05:05.723
Good.

05:05.835 --> 05:07.760
Now throw them all away !

05:11.685 --> 05:14.531
Everything you think you
know about history is a lie.

05:14.546 --> 05:17.260
For example:
the Founding Fathers.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.522
What did they have in common ?

05:18.525 --> 05:19.511
They defied a king ?

05:19.516 --> 05:21.912
They created a system
of checks and balances ?

05:21.958 --> 05:22.753
Wrong !

05:22.755 --> 05:26.520
They were all white, Protestant,
property-owning males.

05:28.927 --> 05:30.242
Evil

05:32.868 --> 05:37.902
Are you saying that America was
founded on misconceptions ?

05:38.177 --> 05:39.123
Who said that ?

05:44.906 --> 05:47.983
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

05:49.255 --> 05:52.623
<i>Fall semester,</i>
<i>you just got interesting.</i>

05:53.505 --> 05:54.833
The bridges of
Madison county.

05:56.178 --> 05:58.773
This book sucks so much.

05:58.777 --> 06:01.952
Homie, my mind has been
opened in so many ways !

06:01.958 --> 06:04.120
Did you know that
every US president

06:04.127 --> 06:06.273
has been a straight white man ?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.890
Even Walt Disney ?

06:07.907 --> 06:11.110
And did you also know that history
is written by the winners ?

06:11.116 --> 06:11.610
Really ?

06:11.627 --> 06:13.482
I thought it was
written by losers.

06:16.656 --> 06:17.701
If you think that,

06:17.718 --> 06:19.251
you should meet my
new professor.

06:19.258 --> 06:23.183
Professor August has shown me
a side of the world I never knew.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.651
Professor August, eh ?

06:24.658 --> 06:26.992
Who is he, somegray-haired
old bookworm ?

06:27.548 --> 06:29.040
Uh, not exactly.

06:29.046 --> 06:29.842
Marge,

06:29.848 --> 06:32.681
I hope I'll be seeing you
tomorrow during office hours.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.563
Uh, 3:00 to 5:00, right ?

06:36.596 --> 06:38.771
If my beads are parted,
come right in.

06:38.818 --> 06:40.453
I will !

06:43.105 --> 06:44.822
To the faculty club !

06:48.635 --> 06:50.690
I never heard that noise before.

06:50.693 --> 06:51.769
Are you sick ?

06:53.047 --> 06:56.279
Hmm. I wonder what's on your mind.

07:01.628 --> 07:03.585
Okay, I relate your pilot light.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.071
Now I just need to do a
little work on the thermostat.

07:06.268 --> 07:08.371
Would you like me to
tell you a story while I work ?

07:08.377 --> 07:10.620
One about a woman
I loved and lost ?

07:10.625 --> 07:12.750
We're in the middle of
our own story, thank you.

07:12.755 --> 07:15.563
Right. No one wants to hear
about the gasman's girl.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.501
"Just shut up, monkey man,
and make the gas flow. "

07:18.508 --> 07:21.061
Anyway,
I was growing to admire

07:21.065 --> 07:23.592
my professor more and more.

07:23.806 --> 07:26.070
...so that's why
instead of "X-X",

07:26.076 --> 07:29.233
I think of the female genes
in a more positive light....

07:30.826 --> 07:32.152
Plus-Plus.

07:33.716 --> 07:37.070
Professor, do you think
white male scientists

07:37.077 --> 07:40.870
have marginalized the
contributions of the Third World ?

07:40.878 --> 07:41.691
Great question.

07:41.706 --> 07:43.661
And the answer is "of course. "

07:43.698 --> 07:46.072
Could a tribe of bushmen
have invented penicillin ?

07:46.076 --> 07:47.382
Maybe they already have.

07:47.386 --> 07:48.712
But no one asked them.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.820
No one asked them.

07:57.015 --> 08:01.593
Oh, Elaine, will you ever find
someone who's sponge-worthy ?

08:01.608 --> 08:05.513
Professor August says the situation
comedy is a doomed genre.

08:05.516 --> 08:06.882
Here's what I say to that:

08:06.896 --> 08:07.730
no soup for you !

08:07.737 --> 08:10.582
Because I am "master of my domain".

08:10.585 --> 08:12.243
Newman.

08:12.247 --> 08:14.671
I wish you would support my comments.

08:14.677 --> 08:17.331
Hey, I worked hard all day
to pay for your education.

08:17.337 --> 08:19.022
Can't I get all Zima'd up and have

08:19.028 --> 08:21.431
my best girl put salve
on my laser burns ?

08:22.048 --> 08:24.432
Are the lasers supposed to burn you ?

08:24.448 --> 08:26.112
Apparently if all the kids fire

08:26.115 --> 08:28.511
at your stomach at once, it adds up.

08:44.177 --> 08:49.183
<i>Closing time open all the doors</i>

08:49.196 --> 08:53.813
<i>and let you out into the world...</i>

08:56.217 --> 08:59.641
Marge, your art project for
"protest studies" is very impressive.

09:02.347 --> 09:04.522
Thank you, Professor August.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.293
Oh, please, I'm your advisor.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.460
Call me Steffan.

09:09.887 --> 09:11.270
Oh, thanks.

09:11.277 --> 09:13.522
It-it's just a note
from my boyfriend.

09:13.525 --> 09:14.382
Let me guess:

09:14.387 --> 09:15.730
he's a high school flame

09:15.735 --> 09:17.223
who's preventing you
from flowering.

09:17.228 --> 09:18.801
Homer's perfect for me !

09:18.808 --> 09:20.112
Just look at this note:

09:20.147 --> 09:22.022
"I miss you. "Aww.

09:22.136 --> 09:24.942
Actually, Marge, if I may
deconstruct that letter.

09:24.945 --> 09:26.742
When he writes "I miss you,"

09:26.747 --> 09:29.611
"I" is the subject
and "you" is the object.

09:29.618 --> 09:31.730
You are his object.

09:31.735 --> 09:33.491
But Homer's so supportive.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.722
He's paying for me
to go to college.

09:35.728 --> 09:37.142
He's paying for you ?

09:37.145 --> 09:38.440
Like he owns you ?

09:38.448 --> 09:40.402
I'm sorry, but that is oppression.

09:40.406 --> 09:43.442
Well, I know you'd never say
anything that isn't objective...

09:43.447 --> 09:45.243
Marge, your assignment is
to think about

09:45.247 --> 09:47.342
what I've said about
your relationship.

09:47.346 --> 09:48.571
When is it due ?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.890
Before it's too late.

09:50.976 --> 09:52.492
Steffan !

09:53.238 --> 09:54.251
Marge ! Marge !

09:54.256 --> 09:55.311
Where are you ? !

09:56.775 --> 09:59.893
Are you by that
Joan Miro Statue ?

09:59.906 --> 10:01.762
lt's "Juan" Miro !

10:01.775 --> 10:03.410
Stupid townie !

10:04.546 --> 10:07.212
Hey, it's townies like me
that cook your food and

10:07.215 --> 10:08.140
clean your bathrooms !

10:08.147 --> 10:11.953
If you did the former better
we'd use the latter less.

10:13.075 --> 10:14.551
That's it, townie !

10:14.556 --> 10:15.221
Run !

10:15.267 --> 10:17.170
Run back to your town !

10:17.177 --> 10:20.311
Marge, this dreamcatcher
was given to me by a warrior

10:20.316 --> 10:23.422
of the Lakopane tribe,
a tribe ruled by women.

10:23.427 --> 10:25.422
I think it has already
caught my dream.

10:29.986 --> 10:31.722
What the hell is
going on here ?

10:31.727 --> 10:32.581
Chanting ? !

10:32.588 --> 10:34.513
Homer !
You're embarrassing me !

10:34.568 --> 10:36.982
Marge, what are you doing
in this crazy college ?

10:36.986 --> 10:39.310
This place is nothing
like Animal House !

10:39.315 --> 10:42.953
I smashed a beatnik's guitar
and he sued me for damages !

10:43.118 --> 10:44.883
Successfully !

10:44.886 --> 10:46.392
Homie, go home.

10:46.397 --> 10:47.961
We'll talk about this later.

10:47.968 --> 10:48.693
Fine !

10:51.337 --> 10:52.292
Slam !

10:59.166 --> 11:00.242
I can't do it !

11:00.305 --> 11:01.921
Our harmony-laden R&B doesn't

11:01.928 --> 11:03.651
make sense in this cruel world.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.582
I'm taking our music to
the next level :

11:05.626 --> 11:09.892
Guitar Rock Utilizing
Nihilist Grunge Energies.

11:09.895 --> 11:12.533
Or, as I call it: Grunge !

11:12.536 --> 11:14.833
We are Sadgasm,

11:14.838 --> 11:16.531
and this song is called...

11:16.536 --> 11:18.602
"Politically Incorrect. "

11:27.107 --> 11:30.372
Pain is brown

11:31.066 --> 11:34.271
Hate is white

11:35.295 --> 11:38.322
Love is black

11:39.648 --> 11:42.430
Stab the night

11:44.777 --> 11:47.113
Kingdom of numb

11:48.895 --> 11:51.082
Closet of hurt

11:52.985 --> 11:55.553
Feelings are dumb

11:57.217 --> 11:59.603
Kisses are dirt...

11:59.647 --> 12:00.602
Kurt ? Kurt ?

12:00.628 --> 12:01.521
It's Marvin !

12:01.547 --> 12:03.781
Your cousin, Marvin Cobain !

12:03.786 --> 12:05.640
You know that new sound
you're looking for ?

12:05.646 --> 12:06.953
Well, listen to this !

12:11.236 --> 12:12.753
Marge ! Marge !

12:15.977 --> 12:17.193
Hey, Marge.

12:17.198 --> 12:20.153
Homer, your music is
so angry and bitter.

12:20.155 --> 12:21.733
Now why would I be angry and bitter ?

12:21.736 --> 12:23.711
Because I'm paying for
you to make goo-goo eyes

12:23.718 --> 12:25.680
at some smooth-talking professor ?

12:25.687 --> 12:27.073
Well, here's a question for you:

12:27.076 --> 12:30.360
why should I stay with a man
who resents how I've flowered ?

12:30.365 --> 12:32.271
Well, if you feel that
way maybe you can find

12:32.288 --> 12:34.531
someone who wants to
nurture the new you,

12:34.535 --> 12:37.273
maybe someone a little
older and more sophisticated,

12:37.276 --> 12:40.423
who can take you to
Europe during the summer.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.281
- Fine by me.
- D'oh !

12:46.538 --> 12:48.812
Hey. Will you sign my boobs ?

12:48.837 --> 12:49.690
Yeah.

12:50.007 --> 12:51.691
Marge come back.

12:55.756 --> 12:58.923
Mom, why did you stop talking
for two and a half minutes ?

12:58.926 --> 13:00.460
It seemed like 20.

13:00.468 --> 13:01.213
Whatever.

13:01.217 --> 13:03.382
Homer and I had the wrenching task

13:03.387 --> 13:05.722
of dividing up a shared life.

13:06.656 --> 13:09.663
Okay, I'll keep the LPs,
and you take the CDs.

13:09.666 --> 13:11.941
I'll take the typewriter;
you take the computer.

13:11.948 --> 13:15.021
I'll take the Enron stock;
you take the Microsoft stock.

13:15.028 --> 13:15.902
And, um...

13:15.907 --> 13:18.212
Who gets... Cutie-puss ?

13:18.727 --> 13:20.900
I just want a tentacle.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.003
<i>I was so depressed,</i>

13:36.108 --> 13:38.750
<i>I spent all my time in a bar.</i>

13:38.778 --> 13:40.000
Gimme a beer, Moe.

13:40.005 --> 13:41.472
I don't sell booze no more.

13:41.496 --> 13:43.242
This is a cigar bar now.

13:44.667 --> 13:46.472
Fine. Cohiba me.

13:48.348 --> 13:49.303
Leave the humidor.

13:54.847 --> 13:56.440
I don't feel so good.

14:01.987 --> 14:03.570
I wasn't trying to steal your watch.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.510
I-I was just comin' on to ya.

14:05.517 --> 14:08.573
Okay, let's go back
to my place.

14:08.808 --> 14:09.700
Oh, boy.

14:10.447 --> 14:13.041
Ready to take my personal
tour of Springfield's

14:13.046 --> 14:15.813
most wheelchair-unfriendly
restaurants ?

14:15.815 --> 14:17.260
I sure am !

14:17.265 --> 14:19.603
I want your knowledge inside me.

14:25.018 --> 14:28.320
Seeing Marge always
reminds me of Marge.

14:31.877 --> 14:34.741
Now where will I get my oxygen ?

14:41.806 --> 14:45.132
Razorblade of apathy

14:45.657 --> 14:48.823
Shave me with your irony

14:49.905 --> 14:51.811
Shave me !

14:52.025 --> 14:54.062
Shave me !

14:57.795 --> 15:00.681
Have you really read
all of these books ?

15:00.686 --> 15:03.521
Morally, I couldn't display
them on shelves if I hadn't.

15:03.525 --> 15:04.901
But I watch sports as well,

15:04.906 --> 15:06.733
just like a regular man.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.071
Good Goddess !

15:09.078 --> 15:12.391
The Patriots deep
in Redskin territory.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.852
This isn't entertainment;

15:13.855 --> 15:15.373
it's genocide !

15:19.055 --> 15:21.382
Why don't we put on some music ?

15:21.515 --> 15:22.891
Shave me !

15:23.538 --> 15:24.513
No ! No !

15:24.525 --> 15:26.072
I need whale songs !

15:26.165 --> 15:27.081
Oceans of the sea

15:33.435 --> 15:36.042
Marge, may I compliment
your appearance ?

15:36.045 --> 15:37.070
Yeah, sure.

15:37.075 --> 15:38.693
You look lovely.

15:38.726 --> 15:40.660
If I were to approach you for a kiss,

15:40.667 --> 15:42.922
would you construe
that as harassment

15:42.926 --> 15:44.381
or give your willing consent ?

15:44.388 --> 15:46.363
Consent, of course.

15:46.365 --> 15:48.772
Ah. Continuing in that line of thought,

15:48.888 --> 15:51.720
may I kiss your mouth with my mouth ?

15:51.725 --> 15:53.550
Just do it already !

15:55.377 --> 15:59.202
<i>I had finally realized
every rock star's dream:</i>

15:59.208 --> 16:01.032
<i>hating being famous.</i>

16:06.685 --> 16:08.452
Why aren't I happy ?

16:08.455 --> 16:11.500
I'm the hottest grunge
artist on Mucous Records.

16:11.506 --> 16:13.841
Weird Al is doing
a parody of my song.

16:13.845 --> 16:17.493
Raisin bread with applesauce

16:18.065 --> 16:21.490
Tony Danza, he's the boss

16:22.298 --> 16:24.250
Brain freeze !

16:24.448 --> 16:26.492
Brain freeze !

16:26.637 --> 16:28.702
Brain freeze !

16:28.808 --> 16:30.753
Brain freeze !

16:31.898 --> 16:35.600
He who is tired of Weird
Al is tired of life.

16:38.138 --> 16:39.323
Look at that lighthouse.

16:39.327 --> 16:43.392
That's the ultimate expression of
phallocentric technocracy,

16:43.398 --> 16:45.162
violating Mother Sky.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.593
I thought they were just
tall so boats could see them.

16:47.597 --> 16:48.330
No, Marge.

16:48.338 --> 16:50.662
Everything penis-shaped is bad.

16:52.616 --> 16:54.273
Look, a wedding !

16:54.888 --> 16:57.590
Slavery is alive and
well in Springfield.

16:57.597 --> 16:59.530
You oppose marriage ?

16:59.538 --> 17:02.740
Marge, marriage has
oppressed women for centuries.

17:02.746 --> 17:03.921
But, Steffan,

17:03.926 --> 17:06.281
I would like to get married someday.

17:06.295 --> 17:10.730
Oh, Marge, it's statements like that
make people say women are stupid.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.430
It's statements like that that...

17:12.508 --> 17:13.422
are mean !

17:13.488 --> 17:14.910
Well, it may sound mean,

17:14.916 --> 17:17.010
but I'm just trying
to help you evolve.

17:17.026 --> 17:19.742
Oh, evolve yourself,
Professor Jerk !

17:19.748 --> 17:22.531
Or should I say,
Associate Professor Jerk !

17:26.435 --> 17:30.192
I only got denied tenure because
my department head is an idiot !

17:30.257 --> 17:33.673
Der, duh, what did
you say about me ?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.311
I'm sorry, Professor Moose.

17:35.327 --> 17:38.092
You're about to get your PhD...

17:38.125 --> 17:40.131
Pound Head Down.

17:50.548 --> 17:54.463
<i>Spread yellow gunk
on my pancake heart</i>

17:54.557 --> 17:57.963
<i>Country-churned girl
in my grocery cart...</i>

17:57.965 --> 18:00.432
Could he be singing about me ?

18:02.896 --> 18:03.842
He is !

18:04.188 --> 18:06.082
<i>I paid for her dreams</i>

18:06.117 --> 18:08.011
<i>She taught me to cry</i>

18:08.058 --> 18:09.521
<i>Like watery knives</i>

18:09.848 --> 18:11.790
<i>Like rain from my eyes</i>

18:13.395 --> 18:17.321
<i>I can't believe you're not mine</i>

18:20.866 --> 18:24.611
<i>I can't believe you're not mine</i>

18:24.987 --> 18:26.752
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

18:28.548 --> 18:30.602
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

18:32.325 --> 18:34.552
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

18:35.946 --> 18:37.981
<i>Mar-ge-rine !</i>

18:39.706 --> 18:41.892
<i>Mar-ge-rine !</i>

18:41.915 --> 18:45.681
He loves me so much
after what I did to him.

18:48.115 --> 18:51.072
We interrupt this "Bleak Block"
to bring you a breaking story.

18:51.075 --> 18:54.283
Grunge trailblazer
Sadgasm have broken up.

18:56.587 --> 18:58.361
Reclusive front man
Homer Simpson has

18:58.368 --> 19:00.613
holed himself up in his
mansion, as rumors swirled

19:00.615 --> 19:03.201
about an out-of-control
narcotics addiction.

19:03.205 --> 19:04.970
This is Kurt Loder reporting from...

19:05.006 --> 19:05.770
the '90s.

19:06.497 --> 19:08.792
No, narcotics !

19:14.998 --> 19:16.680
Oh, my God, you're a junkie !

19:16.718 --> 19:18.053
I need it...

19:18.056 --> 19:19.690
I'm getting you off this stuff.

19:19.706 --> 19:21.101
But I need it !

19:21.108 --> 19:22.631
No, you don't !

19:27.206 --> 19:29.592
<i>Unfortunately, as I later learned,</i>

19:29.596 --> 19:30.783
<i>that wasn't heroin.</i>

19:30.788 --> 19:31.820
<i>It was insulin.</i>

19:31.828 --> 19:34.290
Homer really did
need those injections.

19:34.295 --> 19:37.980
I had become diabetic from
drinking too many Frappuccinos.

19:39.196 --> 19:42.051
Homie, I got so caught
up in the world of college

19:42.058 --> 19:44.833
that I forgot how
important your love was.

19:44.838 --> 19:47.262
Can you find it in your
heart to take me back ?

19:47.268 --> 19:48.331
Of course.

19:48.337 --> 19:52.110
The thing that stood between us
the '90s is almost over.

19:52.115 --> 19:52.853
You're right.

19:52.927 --> 19:55.110
But I'm worried about
what's on the horizon:

19:55.115 --> 19:57.452
reality shows, Britney Spears,

19:57.455 --> 20:00.150
the suspicious number
of home runs being hit...

20:00.158 --> 20:03.260
At least we know there'll never be
a president worse than Bill Clinton.

20:03.275 --> 20:06.740
Imagine, lying in a
deposition in a civil lawsuit.

20:06.748 --> 20:09.290
That's the worst sin a
president could commit.

20:09.296 --> 20:11.403
There'll never be
a worse president.

20:11.416 --> 20:12.141
Never.

20:12.257 --> 20:13.010
Never.

20:13.356 --> 20:15.223
<i>With the '90s drawing to a close,</i>

20:15.226 --> 20:17.313
<i>and the Sydney Olympics
to look forward to,</i>

20:17.316 --> 20:19.002
<i>our love rekindled.</i>

20:19.007 --> 20:20.623
<i>And one moonlight night,</i>

20:20.638 --> 20:23.753
<i>I finally had fun at
a mini-golf course.</i>

20:27.695 --> 20:29.011
<i>Homer, stop !</i>

20:29.075 --> 20:31.843
You don't have to tell
the kids everything !

20:32.298 --> 20:33.770
What did I miss ?
How did it end ?

20:33.778 --> 20:35.192
You two ever get back together ?

20:35.196 --> 20:37.790
Yep, that professor couldn't
keep me and Marge apart.

20:37.795 --> 20:40.882
I mean, unless he had been
a little nicer at the beach.

20:42.086 --> 20:45.290
Well, that professor did
teach me one good lesson:

20:45.298 --> 20:47.801
Homie is where my heart is.

20:49.088 --> 20:50.892
And once we were back together,

20:50.898 --> 20:54.080
I was to happy ever to grunge again.

20:55.666 --> 20:56.912
Townies.
