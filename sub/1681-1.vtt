00:02.620 --> 00:05.586
Kids, there is something
I wish my dad told me.

00:05.828 --> 00:08.761
The longest pause
you will ever experience in your life

00:08.881 --> 00:10.978
is the one that follows
asking the question...

00:11.098 --> 00:12.384
Will you marry me?

00:13.295 --> 00:16.893
Your brain goes into overdrive,
imaging every possible response.

00:17.914 --> 00:18.814
No.

00:19.554 --> 00:20.777
Oh, God, no.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.065
You want me to marry...

00:26.658 --> 00:27.498
No.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.677
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't.

00:30.917 --> 00:31.713
Mark Johnson,

00:31.832 --> 00:34.812
the quarterback from your high school
football team, already asked me.

00:34.932 --> 00:36.191
What's up, Turd?

00:36.886 --> 00:37.966
It's Ted!

00:39.309 --> 00:40.469
But if you're lucky,

00:40.589 --> 00:44.184
she may answer with the single
greatest word in the English language.

00:44.695 --> 00:45.507
Yes.

01:00.732 --> 01:03.361
Stella and I spent that summer
happily engaged.

01:04.051 --> 01:06.248
Marshall was still coping
with unemployment.

01:06.368 --> 01:07.542
What are you doing?

01:09.706 --> 01:11.648
Lily threw herself
into her painting.

01:11.879 --> 01:13.211
What are you doing?

01:14.500 --> 01:17.023
Barney was rehabilitating
from his bus accident.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.607
What are you doing?

01:19.912 --> 01:22.940
And well, Marshall just kept coping
with unemployment.

01:26.218 --> 01:27.597
What are you doing?

01:28.959 --> 01:33.264
And Robin continued to uphold the high
journalistic standards of Metro News 1.

01:33.874 --> 01:38.805
Is your favorite brand of dental floss
poisoning your entire family?

01:39.092 --> 01:41.468
Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking...

01:42.199 --> 01:43.081
Tooth.

01:45.962 --> 01:48.044
Okay, I officially hate my job.

01:48.377 --> 01:52.306
I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who
shows up at night and scares people.

01:52.538 --> 01:54.748
I'm the bogeyman
with a teleprompter.

01:57.815 --> 01:59.860
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

01:59.981 --> 02:02.730
That's hilarious!
Great joke, Robin, great joke.

02:02.995 --> 02:05.957
Barney, no offense to Robin,
but that wasn't that funny.

02:06.117 --> 02:08.572
Are you kidding?
That was a great joke.

02:08.692 --> 02:11.226
It's smart, funny, beautiful,
the whole package.

02:11.346 --> 02:13.788
It's everything you're afraid
to let yourself want.

02:14.431 --> 02:15.593
In a joke.

02:18.049 --> 02:20.172
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

02:21.227 --> 02:22.083
Classic.

02:24.224 --> 02:27.766
Okay, what is so urgent
that you called me and begged me

02:27.887 --> 02:30.501
to come over at 7:22 in the morning?

02:30.621 --> 02:34.030
I could tell you knew something
was up with me, and you're right.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.290
But I can't tell you what it is.
I should tell you, but I can't!

02:37.410 --> 02:40.880
I have to. I never will! I'm going to.
Let's just drop it. What's up with you?

02:41.768 --> 02:43.035
Barney, just say it.

02:46.491 --> 02:48.130
I think I'm in love with Robin.

02:49.150 --> 02:52.164
Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas
for Stella's wedding shower.

02:52.284 --> 02:53.784
Does she like to cook?

02:55.282 --> 02:56.823
Actually, I don't know.

02:57.121 --> 02:58.801
What's her favorite color?

02:59.854 --> 03:01.380
Don't know that either.

03:01.750 --> 03:04.113
- Well, does she have any hobbies?
- Yes.

03:04.232 --> 03:06.794
She's exactly the kind of person
who would have hobbies.

03:07.073 --> 03:08.573
And interests, too.

03:09.130 --> 03:10.815
I am one lucky son of a bitch.

03:10.935 --> 03:11.799
Dude,

03:11.919 --> 03:14.353
you don't know anything
about the woman you're marrying.

03:14.513 --> 03:15.407
What?

03:15.528 --> 03:17.024
You're crazy! I know plenty.

03:17.296 --> 03:18.730
What color are her eyes?

03:19.905 --> 03:22.370
The color of the ocean
after a storm.

03:22.530 --> 03:23.623
Which is?

03:26.454 --> 03:27.409
Beautiful.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.341
I don't believe it.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.569
I thought you called me over here
to uncuff you from your sex swing again,

03:33.690 --> 03:35.302
but you're in love?

03:35.891 --> 03:37.150
That is so sweet!

03:37.311 --> 03:38.625
It's not "sweet."

03:38.745 --> 03:40.658
It's like a disease.

03:40.818 --> 03:43.580
I slept with Robin one time
and I caught feelings.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.377
I caught feelings bad.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.567
I used protection and everything.

03:48.569 --> 03:52.140
Barney, you don't "catch" feelings,
you just have them.

03:52.445 --> 03:54.768
- And they're good.
- They're terrible!

03:55.046 --> 03:57.157
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

03:57.502 --> 04:00.343
She's all I think about.
I close my eyes, I see Robin.

04:00.463 --> 04:02.705
I, I hear a song;
it reminds me of Robin.

04:02.865 --> 04:03.641
Morning.

04:03.761 --> 04:06.498
I sleep with that chick,
I'm thinking about Robin.

04:07.472 --> 04:10.346
Okay, so I don't know
every single detail about Stella.

04:10.614 --> 04:12.731
What's really about?
Do you not like her or something?

04:12.852 --> 04:15.899
No, Ted, I like Stella lot.
She's a Mets fan.

04:16.060 --> 04:16.779
Really?

04:16.899 --> 04:19.291
It's just that everything with you
has moved so fast.

04:19.411 --> 04:21.267
You've only known
each other a few months.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.724
Don't you think maybe you should
slow things down a little bit?

04:23.844 --> 04:26.024
- Get to know each other better?
- I'll have a whole life

04:26.145 --> 04:27.737
time to get to know her better.

04:27.856 --> 04:30.680
Right now,
I know the one thing that I have to:

04:31.491 --> 04:32.546
that I love her.

04:32.666 --> 04:33.963
You love her?

04:34.251 --> 04:36.374
Barney, how can you be in love,

04:36.494 --> 04:38.781
and still be sleeping
with anything that moves?

04:40.020 --> 04:41.865
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

04:42.143 --> 04:43.577
That's like saying,

04:43.697 --> 04:46.351
"How can an ant carry
"20 times its body weight,

04:46.471 --> 04:48.455
but root beer floats
are still delicious?"

04:48.575 --> 04:50.055
Are the two even related?

04:50.215 --> 04:51.178
Really?

04:51.510 --> 04:53.857
Barney, you're going to have
to stop screwing around

04:53.978 --> 04:55.675
if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.094
"Boyfriend"?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.288
I don't want to be
Robin's boyfriend.

05:01.699 --> 05:03.333
Well, what do you want, then?

05:03.493 --> 05:05.839
I don't know.
I just want to be with her.

05:06.327 --> 05:07.416
All the time.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.645
I want to hear about her day
and tell her about mine.

05:10.991 --> 05:13.856
I want to hold her hand
and smell her hair.

05:15.178 --> 05:17.363
But I don't want to be
her stupid boyfriend.

05:18.182 --> 05:20.096
Barney, what you just described

05:20.375 --> 05:23.749
is a relationship between
a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

05:24.002 --> 05:26.048
And a pretty clingy one at that.

05:26.607 --> 05:29.290
Look, Lily, are you going to help me out
with this or not?

05:29.410 --> 05:31.303
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

05:31.423 --> 05:35.131
I see a confused, little kid in the
corner trying to eat the lefty scissors,

05:35.251 --> 05:37.290
I gotta help the poor,
little bastard.

05:37.559 --> 05:39.978
But only if you stop
sleeping around.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.025
Deal?

05:42.208 --> 05:43.085
Deal.

05:43.245 --> 05:44.313
Coming up next,

05:44.434 --> 05:48.940
is your local ice cream man actually
driving a roving meth lab on wheels?

05:49.491 --> 05:51.171
Stay tuned for the full...

05:52.721 --> 05:53.625
Scoop.

05:53.746 --> 05:54.761
Really?

05:59.892 --> 06:03.693
I know dudes think it's girlie
for a guy to cook, but us ladies?

06:04.199 --> 06:06.592
- We find it mighty sexy.
- Really?

06:06.953 --> 06:07.887
You know...

06:08.574 --> 06:10.103
My grandma taught me how.

06:10.223 --> 06:12.003
- Oh, yeah, she did.
- Yeah.

06:12.123 --> 06:15.235
I had a lot of time after school
to watch her cook because

06:15.503 --> 06:16.823
I wasn't good at sports.

06:17.715 --> 06:19.204
I'm on fire right now.

06:24.193 --> 06:25.759
Delicious. What's in this pesto?

06:26.026 --> 06:28.945
Oh, you know, the usual:
basil, garlic, olive oil,

06:29.065 --> 06:31.186
but can you guess
my secret ingredient?

06:31.547 --> 06:32.464
Peanuts.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.278
Yes. How did you know that?

06:40.955 --> 06:43.462
- OK, let's my think, what else?
- You know what, sweetie?

06:43.622 --> 06:46.312
I woke up so early
and I had a really long day at work.

06:46.431 --> 06:48.946
And there was that whole thing
where you tried to kill me.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.527
Can we please just go to sleep?

06:50.648 --> 06:53.212
No, I clearly need
to know more about you.

06:53.498 --> 06:55.403
Let's do firsts. First kiss?

06:56.086 --> 06:57.682
Dale Harris, second grade.

06:57.949 --> 07:01.124
You're talking like peck on the cheek
or a full-on passionate making out?

07:01.284 --> 07:04.163
- Passionate making out.
- OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.

07:04.535 --> 07:05.932
First time you had sex.

07:06.052 --> 07:07.891
- Dale Harris, second...
- Stop it.

07:08.012 --> 07:10.061
Billy Devito,
sophomore year of college.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.087
Prude.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.534
Molly McKenzie,
junior year of high school.

07:13.655 --> 07:14.506
Slut.

07:15.444 --> 07:17.617
Robin just needs
to see this new see of you.

07:17.932 --> 07:19.955
- So just call her up?
- Just call her up.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.568
It's...

07:25.716 --> 07:26.674
Hi, Robin.

07:28.759 --> 07:31.105
She wasn't there.
I left a voice mail.

07:31.265 --> 07:33.301
You left a voice,
but it wasn't male.

07:34.103 --> 07:35.399
Barney, I don't get it.

07:35.519 --> 07:37.902
You've called a million girls
a million times.

07:38.021 --> 07:39.663
Yeah,
but those were just booty calls.

07:39.783 --> 07:42.003
On a booty call,
you barely even have to talk.

07:42.642 --> 07:45.303
Around 9:00 p.m., you say...
Hey, baby, it's Barney.

07:45.422 --> 07:47.238
You busy tonight? Sweet.

07:47.358 --> 07:49.515
See you in half an hour? Can't wait.

07:50.013 --> 07:52.502
But the later it gets,
the fewer words you need.

07:52.622 --> 07:54.391
Barney. Busy? Sweet.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.444
And by 3:00 in the morning...

08:03.188 --> 08:04.072
Sweet.

08:05.393 --> 08:06.723
A question mark?

08:06.843 --> 08:08.893
You got laid off a question mark?

08:12.118 --> 08:14.822
It's no worse
than your super-obvious code words.

08:16.471 --> 08:18.425
- Rhinoceros.
- We have to go.

08:19.928 --> 08:21.711
Great. Now we need a new code word.

08:23.261 --> 08:25.894
Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin.
What do I do?

08:26.127 --> 08:27.976
No-no-no-no, aah!
Robin...

08:28.268 --> 08:29.972
Great to hear from you.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.191
To what do I owe the pleasure?

08:32.479 --> 08:35.267
You called, went, and hung up.

08:35.385 --> 08:36.517
What do you want?

08:36.636 --> 08:37.746
Help me!

08:38.436 --> 08:40.191
Just ask her something.

08:41.541 --> 08:43.466
How are you feeling today?

08:43.940 --> 08:44.885
Fine.

08:45.005 --> 08:46.495
Something personal.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.190
At what age
did you first get your period?

08:52.187 --> 08:53.947
Did you just ask me
about about my period?

08:54.106 --> 08:55.492
No, I did not.

08:57.068 --> 08:58.759
Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.

08:58.879 --> 09:00.468
Just ask her out.

09:02.183 --> 09:04.504
Robin, I was wondering if...

09:06.967 --> 09:08.519
Nothing. Gotta go. Bye.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.766
That was just a practical joke.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.689
I'm not really in love with Robin.

09:14.809 --> 09:16.853
You should've seen
the look on your face.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.563
There's cameras right there
and there and there.

09:21.028 --> 09:24.844
What a legendary prank that
we're never going to speak of again.

09:30.554 --> 09:31.378
Gross.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.997
- First movie you ever saw.
- Benji,1981.

09:38.242 --> 09:40.878
I watched it recently
with Lucy and I just thought,

09:40.998 --> 09:43.593
"Oh, that dog is so dead right now."

09:44.910 --> 09:45.926
What about you?

09:46.046 --> 09:48.980
My dad took me to an old drive-in
to see the original Star Wars.

09:49.569 --> 09:51.777
You know,
I've actually never seen Star Wars.

09:51.938 --> 09:54.240
She's never seen Star Wars?!

09:54.401 --> 09:56.051
Ted, the only people in the universe

09:56.171 --> 09:58.399
who haven't seen Star Wars
are the characters,

09:58.519 --> 10:00.121
and that's 'cause they lived them.

10:00.241 --> 10:03.401
- That's 'cause they lived the Star Wars.
- You've got to calm down.

10:03.532 --> 10:06.260
I told you. You didn't know
this girl well enough. What if...

10:06.707 --> 10:09.877
- you show it to her, she doesn't like it?
- Dude, it's just a movie.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.537
Star Warsis your all-time
favorite movie,

10:12.657 --> 10:14.964
and whether or not Stella likes
it is actually important.

10:15.084 --> 10:17.498
It's like, it's a test
of how compatible you guys are.

10:18.665 --> 10:19.793
It's just a movie.

10:19.956 --> 10:21.675
It's just a movie!

10:21.875 --> 10:25.654
<i>121 awesome minutes later</i>

10:26.662 --> 10:28.255
If Stella doesn't like this movie,

10:28.375 --> 10:30.100
- I can't marry her.
- You can't.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.690
- You want to watch it again?
- I do.

10:39.350 --> 10:41.543
Where are the boys?
I thought this was a group thing.

10:41.663 --> 10:44.409
I lied. They're not coming
and I'm about to leave.

10:44.529 --> 10:45.489
Why?

10:45.610 --> 10:46.457
Because...

10:46.616 --> 10:49.170
they're not in love with Robin,
and neither am I.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.712
I mean, she's great and sweet.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.557
I'm not going to pretend
that I haven't noticed her body,

10:54.677 --> 10:56.937
but this is off topic.
Good luck.

10:57.097 --> 10:58.697
Wait, wait, I
can't do this.

10:58.816 --> 11:00.850
She'll never take me seriously.
She thinks I'm some

11:01.022 --> 11:02.239
womanizing idiot.

11:02.753 --> 11:04.773
We both know
you're more than that.

11:05.324 --> 11:07.685
How Robin the Barney
I met the other day.

11:08.215 --> 11:10.900
You mean the insecure,
touchy-feely she-male

11:11.020 --> 11:13.099
who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?

11:13.789 --> 11:15.577
Ted hit that for over a year.

11:16.727 --> 11:17.772
Wish me luck.

11:19.152 --> 11:21.374
I just thought it'd be fun
to watch a movie tonight,

11:21.494 --> 11:24.558
and since you've never seen Star Wars,
I figured why not?

11:24.925 --> 11:25.970
No big deal.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.652
It's pretty good.

11:28.028 --> 11:29.547
Sounds like a plan.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.059
I'm just grab a beer.
You want one?

11:37.179 --> 11:39.175
The movie's already started, so...

11:39.687 --> 11:42.658
It's some words flying through space.
I'm not going to read that anyway.

11:42.818 --> 11:43.786
Oh, my God.

11:43.945 --> 11:45.403
Off to a bad start.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.007
What are you doing down there?

11:48.127 --> 11:50.582
I'm making sure my best friend
is marrying the right woman.

11:50.703 --> 11:52.011
That's what I'm doing.

11:52.130 --> 11:54.107
What are you doing,
hiding behind the couch?

11:54.227 --> 11:55.478
You need to get a job.

11:57.548 --> 11:58.923
I really do, don't I?

12:00.983 --> 12:02.105
So, Robin...

12:03.051 --> 12:04.413
tell me about your day,

12:04.740 --> 12:08.091
and not just what happened,
how you felt about what happened.

12:09.227 --> 12:11.665
- What?
- I'm not looking to problem-solve,

12:11.784 --> 12:13.349
I'm just looking to listen.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.440
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?

12:18.235 --> 12:19.993
You're being super nice. It's...

12:20.114 --> 12:21.913
freaking me out. Be...

12:22.604 --> 12:24.978
gross, be inappropriate.
Be Barney.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.673
I'm being Barney,

12:27.427 --> 12:29.931
and I think tonight's going to be

12:30.051 --> 12:32.037
de... wait for it... lightful.

12:33.470 --> 12:34.470
Delightful.

12:35.346 --> 12:36.348
Right.

12:40.152 --> 12:42.326
So I went
to the chiropractor yesterday.

12:42.486 --> 12:45.792
That guy bent me over the table
and pounded me for a good hour.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.374
Is insurance going to cover that?
Sometimes they don't.

12:52.036 --> 12:53.082
That's it?

12:56.982 --> 12:58.664
Today I was at the dentist.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.970
That guy drilled me

13:01.475 --> 13:02.803
all day long.

13:03.655 --> 13:05.124
He drilled me hard.

13:06.078 --> 13:07.855
He filled all of my cavities.

13:08.357 --> 13:09.468
Come on, man.

13:10.026 --> 13:12.706
- Your teeth look fantastic.
- Who are you?

13:21.328 --> 13:22.329
What?

13:23.368 --> 13:24.370
Nothing.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.054
You were staring
at me.

13:28.626 --> 13:30.425
You look really beautiful tonight.

13:32.239 --> 13:34.556
You don't look
so bad yourself, mister.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.543
Great scene, great scene.

13:39.254 --> 13:40.909
Star Wars fun fact number seven...

13:41.069 --> 13:42.847
George Lucas based
the film's structure

13:42.967 --> 13:45.168
on Akira Kurosawa's
The Hidden Fortress.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.341
He also owes a debt to Campbell's work
with comparative mythology.

13:48.501 --> 13:50.576
Yeah, Ted,
I'm losing wood over here.

13:50.696 --> 13:51.955
What's going on?

13:52.238 --> 13:53.239
Nothing.

13:54.712 --> 13:55.725
Wait, it's

13:55.995 --> 13:58.655
really important to you
that I like this movie, isn't it?

14:02.239 --> 14:05.042
I'm not gonna like it with you
staring at me the whole time.

14:05.337 --> 14:07.737
Go to your room
and I will come get you when it's over.

14:07.857 --> 14:08.859
Go.

14:15.925 --> 14:17.429
Should I leave, too?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.910
What part, what part?

14:27.960 --> 14:28.995
Thanks.

14:30.190 --> 14:31.189
Nothing?

14:31.434 --> 14:32.762
Not even a glance?

14:33.014 --> 14:36.577
Even I was thinking about rocking
a motorboat on those bad boys.

14:36.902 --> 14:38.530
What the hell is wrong with you?

14:39.533 --> 14:42.818
I don't always want to be that guy.
Sometimes I want to be someone

14:42.938 --> 14:44.837
you can have
an actual conversation with.

14:46.039 --> 14:49.016
Now, tell me something about you
that I don't know yet.

14:49.698 --> 14:50.557
Seriously.

14:55.606 --> 14:57.673
There's a job opening
at a new cable network

14:57.793 --> 14:59.702
that would be perfect for me...

15:00.593 --> 15:04.284
completely legit world news, interviews
with people who matter...

15:05.932 --> 15:08.426
- but I decided I'm not going to apply.
- Why not?

15:08.795 --> 15:10.033
Because I'm a joke.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.271
I'm just the scary news lady
from some stupid local news channel.

15:14.420 --> 15:16.069
We both know you're more than that.

15:17.398 --> 15:18.824
Promise me you'll apply.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.916
- It's not as easy...
- Promise me you'll apply.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.685
I promise.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.120
She's up to the scene
where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape

15:33.240 --> 15:35.790
- from the Death Star's trash compactor.
- Great scene.

15:36.414 --> 15:37.531
Greatscene?

15:40.311 --> 15:42.310
Okay, we should have just heard...

15:46.883 --> 15:49.473
but Stella didn't make a peep.
I'm gonna take a look.

15:58.813 --> 16:00.829
She's not even watching.
She's texting.

16:01.421 --> 16:04.212
- I'll tell her you still want to be friends.
- I don't believe this.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.756
I believe, she knows this is important
to me. She's blatantly...

16:11.053 --> 16:13.107
"Stop watching me, jackasses."

16:14.782 --> 16:17.133
- To taking chances.
- To taking chances.

16:20.533 --> 16:23.982
You know, Robin, there's actually something,
I do want to talk to you about.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.369
- Last call.
- Of course it is.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.722
- One more for the road?
- Yeah, why not?

16:29.276 --> 16:30.452
Hold that thought?

16:33.257 --> 16:34.258
I will.

16:42.938 --> 16:44.452
- I loved it.
- Yes!

16:45.370 --> 16:48.077
I am marrying a woman
who is not only hot

16:48.198 --> 16:50.436
but loves Star Wars.
That's the dream.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.500
- What was that?
- I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me

16:55.620 --> 16:57.653
through the space-time continuum.
We did it.

16:57.772 --> 17:00.833
We did it,
you masturbating little bastard.

17:01.135 --> 17:02.711
Champagne for everybody.

17:05.903 --> 17:07.035
It was so good.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.877
- You hated it, didn't you?
- It's so stupid. First of all,

17:09.998 --> 17:13.108
how do they understand that walking bear
they hang around with all the time?

17:13.269 --> 17:14.821
- Wookiee.
- He goes...

17:16.707 --> 17:18.550
They're all like,
"That's a good point, Bear,

17:18.671 --> 17:20.586
- "let's try that."
- He's a Wookiee,

17:20.705 --> 17:23.691
and his kind is actually
more intelligent than they appear.

17:26.383 --> 17:28.507
That is Ted's favorite movie
of all time.

17:28.628 --> 17:30.965
He watches it
when he's home sick with the flu.

17:31.085 --> 17:34.017
He watches it on rainy
Sunday afternoons in the fall.

17:34.373 --> 17:35.949
He watches it on Christmas Eve.

17:37.228 --> 17:40.133
Ted watches Star Wars
in sickness and in health,

17:40.254 --> 17:42.045
in good times and in bad.

17:43.223 --> 17:46.749
Do you really think that you can pretend
to like a movie that you actually hate

17:47.115 --> 17:48.596
for the rest of your life?

17:53.318 --> 17:54.319
I do.

17:56.235 --> 17:57.786
Then, Ted's a lucky guy.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.792
Bear.

18:07.923 --> 18:09.322
So, here's the deal.

18:09.442 --> 18:12.060
April, have... you met Barney?

18:15.359 --> 18:18.164
April just finished her shift,
she's looking to blow off some steam.

18:20.363 --> 18:22.274
Would you excuse us for one sec?

18:23.585 --> 18:26.081
- What are you doing?
- You were so nice to me tonight,

18:26.201 --> 18:28.518
I wanted to return the favor,
wingwoman-style.

18:29.882 --> 18:31.107
So, as I was saying,

18:31.268 --> 18:33.632
Barney is the Yankees'
new second-baseman.

18:33.752 --> 18:37.690
And Barney, April asked if tomorrow,
you could hit a goal for her

18:38.007 --> 18:39.665
during the baseball match.

18:40.056 --> 18:41.838
You can't make this stuff up.

18:42.827 --> 18:44.486
So, you two kids have fun.

18:47.572 --> 18:49.479
So are you...
nervous about the game?

18:49.639 --> 18:51.609
Yeah, I'm nervous
for the other team

18:52.804 --> 18:54.700
'cause when I step
up to that plate...

18:57.460 --> 18:59.375
I am not a New York Yankee.

19:00.538 --> 19:03.192
Any other night, I would probably try
to convince you that I am, but I'm not.

19:03.311 --> 19:06.655
I'm just some guy who's in love
with the girl that just left,

19:07.204 --> 19:09.742
and she's never going
to feel the same way.

19:12.044 --> 19:13.442
So I'm just going to go.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.135
And that was it.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.914
I'm so sorry, Barney.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.528
You can't give up.

19:21.649 --> 19:24.929
You know, it may take some time,
but once Robin sees the new you...

19:26.176 --> 19:29.732
When my family gets to Yankee Stadium,
are the tickets under your name or mine?

19:29.892 --> 19:32.384
My name, and tell your
nephews to bring their mitts.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.325
They're going to be
in foul ball country.

19:36.865 --> 19:40.045
Come on.
The Robin stuff was completely true.

19:41.332 --> 19:42.552
Damn it, Barney.

19:42.672 --> 19:44.784
I mean, for the last time,

19:44.904 --> 19:46.914
you can't... you can't

19:47.162 --> 19:49.214
be in love with Robin
and still be sleeping

19:49.334 --> 19:51.203
with every bimbo on the planet.

19:51.436 --> 19:52.990
You have to choose right now.

19:55.231 --> 19:56.621
- I choose bimbos.
- What?

19:57.862 --> 20:01.075
Bimbos make me happy.
Bimbos make me feel alive.

20:01.781 --> 20:05.433
Bimbos make me want
to pretend to be a better man.

20:05.910 --> 20:09.563
This whole thing with Robin was just
a fling, but at the end of the day,

20:09.683 --> 20:11.068
my heart belongs to bimbos.

20:12.006 --> 20:14.827
This is just a defense mechanism,
because

20:14.948 --> 20:18.083
you're afraid of getting hurt.
You're just confused.

20:18.244 --> 20:19.882
Oh, I'm not confused.

20:20.622 --> 20:22.174
You know who is confused?

20:22.676 --> 20:23.675
Bimbos.

20:24.037 --> 20:26.768
They're easily confused.
It's one of the thousand little things

20:26.887 --> 20:28.251
I love about them.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.555
I love their vacant,

20:30.771 --> 20:34.527
trusting stares, their sluggish,
unencumbered minds,

20:35.121 --> 20:37.013
their unresolved daddy issues.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.005
I love them and they love me.

20:40.821 --> 20:44.478
Bimbos have always been there for me,
through thick and thin.

20:45.158 --> 20:47.313
Mostly thin.
B- man don't do thick crust.

20:47.472 --> 20:48.440
What up?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.734
See you, Barney.
