02:07.640 --> 02:09.756
Well, just make some phone calls,
yeah.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.753
Armand Greer, Pete Harris,
the usual gang of idiots.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.354
l wanna know
who's still talking to me.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.637
Yeah, well, make it about 8:00.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.519
Give me time
to take a long hot bath.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.592
Okay, l'll see you then, baby.
All right, bye.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.757
- Christine?
- Yeah.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.953
- You know, l liked her.
- She is real easy to like.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.232
So, what do you think
about the limo, huh?

02:31.400 --> 02:32.389
Just like the old days.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.472
Oh, l don't know.
l'm not really too fond of the old days.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.517
Well, it was just a little gift
from my attorneys,

02:37.680 --> 02:39.318
so we might as well enjoy it.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.314
How did you swing this?

02:41.480 --> 02:43.072
l thought you didn't have
a shot at parole

02:43.240 --> 02:44.798
for at least another couple years.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.269
l don't honestly know, son.
The lawyers worked something out.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.637
- l just packed my bags and ran.
- So, what are you going to do now?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.394
Long-term, who knows?
Short-term, we party.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.758
Call your friends, whoever you want.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.559
We'll call room service,
have Ricardo fix something up.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.871
Give me a chance to forget
l lost the last two years of my life.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.238
l'm glad you're out.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.038
Me too, son.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.872
Me too.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.596
Looks like we have company.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.399
Yeah, everybody turned out
for their favourite felon.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.516
Let me handle this.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.354
Was there a financial transaction
involved in your sudden release?

03:33.520 --> 03:34.714
l don't have that kind of money.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.598
What about the lawsuits
pending against you?

03:36.760 --> 03:38.990
How will you compensate
the people that allege you stole?

03:39.160 --> 03:40.912
Talk to my lawyers.
l've been out of touch.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.150
What's the first thing you'll do
now that you're free?

03:43.320 --> 03:44.594
l'm going to Disneyland.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.352
l'm gonna spend some time
with my son.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.956
- Mr. McKay, what about the--?
- That's it, guys. l'll talk to you later.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.511
l thought you meant it
when you said you loved me.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.989
- l did.
- Oh, but you don't anymore?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.914
- This is not about love, Jackie.
- Then what is it about?

03:58.080 --> 04:01.231
l like women, okay?
l can't help myself.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.870
A 1 9-year-old dental hygienist
is hardly a woman.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.112
- l told you. That's over.
- Only because you're bored with her.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.989
Okay, so l'm a bastard.
What do you want from me?

04:12.160 --> 04:15.709
l want you out of my sight.
Go be with your bimbo.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.552
l'm sorry, Kelly.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.471
lt's not your fault.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.637
l mean, l like your dad.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.155
He's always been really cool to me,
you know?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.390
l just can't believe
he'd do something so tacky.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.038
Yeah, well, believe it.
He did the same thing to my mother.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.953
lt was just
a different dental hygienist.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.555
Only my mother didn't have
the guts to throw him out,

04:35.720 --> 04:38.678
so she moved to Portland
and started a new life.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.718
When it comes to throwing guys out,
my mom's got a lot of practise.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.799
l just feel bad for Erin.
l mean, she's just a baby.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.948
At least she's too young
to really know what's going on.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.155
Until she gets old enough

04:50.320 --> 04:52.675
to start wondering
where her daddy's at.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.516
lf Mel and Jackie crash and burn,
what are we gonna do?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.435
We're the kids.
We'll do what we're told.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.711
That's easy for you to say.
You get to stay here.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.757
What about me? Where do l go?

05:04.920 --> 05:07.070
l mean, the only reason my mom
agreed to let me live here

05:07.240 --> 05:10.073
is because my dad convinced her
he'd make a good home life for me.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.798
David, you'll still have a home.

05:11.960 --> 05:16.317
Come on, in a bachelor pad
in the marina with his latest girlfriend?

05:16.800 --> 05:18.392
No, thanks.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.672
We'll figure something out.
l promise.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.958
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.350
- <i>Hi, how's your dad?</i>
- Are you kidding? He's great.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.238
He's having a party tonight
at the Bel Age.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.038
- Why don't you come over?
- l don't know.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.351
David and l are kind of dealing
with some heavy family stuff.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.351
Tell him to come too.
l'm inviting everybody.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.238
All right, hold on.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.275
Dylan's dad's having a party tonight.
Do you wanna go?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.479
l can't. l've gotta go to Donna's

05:46.640 --> 05:49.154
and try and study
for my chem. midterm.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.551
You go. l think it'd do you some good
to get out of the house for a little while.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.392
No kidding.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.998
- l'll be there. What time?
- Eight o'clock?

05:58.160 --> 06:00.116
Great. Bye.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.756
<i>Mr, McKay,</i>
<i>was there a financial transaction</i>

06:04.920 --> 06:06.592
<i>involved in your sudden release</i>
<i>from prison?</i>

06:06.760 --> 06:08.591
- <i>l don't have that kind of money,</i>
- Right.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.079
Two years on a ten-year sentence.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.958
The guy hardly even has time
to write a book.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.712
Dad, you don't even know the guy.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.791
Don't tell me
you're gonna defend him.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.509
He's a liar and a crook
and God knows what else.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.033
Why do you hate Jack McKay
so much?

06:21.200 --> 06:22.997
Everyone makes mistakes.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.152
Brenda, it's beyond mistakes.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.595
Hello? Oh, hi, Dylan.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.190
Oh, yeah, she's right here. Hang on.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.314
Hi, l just saw you on television.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.514
Tonight?

06:44.440 --> 06:47.671
Okay. Are you at the hotel now?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.036
l'll call you back. Bye.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.236
Where are you going, young lady?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.631
- Out.
- Brenda.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.950
They're having a party
for Dylan's father at the Bel Age.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.314
Dylan invited me and l'm going.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.232
No, l'm sorry, you're not.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.794
l don't believe it. The war
is starting all over again, isn't it?

07:04.960 --> 07:07.520
Brenda, this is not about Dylan.
His father is another story.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.240
l don't want you going anywhere
near this man, do you understand?

07:10.400 --> 07:11.958
Dad, it is only a party.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.352
Brenda, Jack McKay went to jail
for insider trading,

07:16.520 --> 07:18.670
but that is only the tip of the iceberg.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.274
He was involved
in money laundering, bribery,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.192
and he's got Mob connections,
for God's sake.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.440
Honey, l don't ask you for much,

07:26.600 --> 07:29.831
but, please,
trust your old man on this one.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.513
So you're heading over
to the Bel Age?

07:40.680 --> 07:42.830
Dylan said it's gonna
be a pretty happening scene.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.390
Oh, come on, even without Magic,
l'd still rather be at a Lakers game.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.834
Are you sure you can't get away?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.514
Look, l've got two tickets
at centre court, floor level.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.989
No, can do, chief. Duty calls.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.914
Sanders, get out of here.
You're not spending any money.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.552
So you wanna get in on a little bet
before you go down to the game?

08:00.720 --> 08:02.790
- Cleveland's looking pretty good.
- First of all,

08:02.960 --> 08:05.520
l do not bet against the Lakers.
Ever, okay?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.750
And second of all, how many times
do l have to tell you

08:07.920 --> 08:09.273
that basketball is a sucker's bet?

08:09.440 --> 08:12.000
Well, maybe for you, sonny,
but l follow the game.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.390
- l'm practically a maven.
- Yeah.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.233
Talk to me tomorrow
when l'm $1 00 richer, buddy boy.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.590
Hey, Nat, would you do me a favour?

08:20.760 --> 08:23.035
Would you call Duke
and put a buck on Cleveland for me?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.918
Brandon, isn't that kind of steep?

08:25.080 --> 08:26.911
No, they're only giving the Lakers
two points.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.152
- Oh, two points.
- Nat, it's easy money.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.318
There's no such thing, pal.
Stay loose.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.078
Andrea, you've had your head buried
in these magazines for an hour.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.037
What could possibly be
so interesting?

08:42.200 --> 08:44.634
Steve, what do you think
about redheads?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.395
Redheads? Do you know
what they say about redheads?

08:47.560 --> 08:48.595
What?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.353
They have red hair.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.513
<i>V</i> ery funny.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.114
What about blondes?
Do you like blondes?

08:56.280 --> 08:59.397
Well, isn't that a silly question?
Come on, Andrea, this is California.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.994
Blondes are like the state flower
or something.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.878
That's not what l meant, Steve.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.234
l know what you meant, Andrea.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.233
l think you'd look great as a blonde.
Why don't you go for it?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.597
But l couldn't.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.949
- No, l mean, it's just too radical.
- Maybe radical is what you need.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.874
You think so?

09:18.040 --> 09:19.473
The more radical-er the better.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.477
Steve, there's no such word
as ''radical-er.''

09:23.640 --> 09:27.349
lt's not a word. lt's an attitude.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.272
You know what l'm saying?

09:42.760 --> 09:45.911
- Hi.
- Oh, Kel. Hey, you look great.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.991
l was beginning to think no one
was gonna show.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.309
l'm the only one?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.870
So far, yeah. Everyone else
was busy or so they said.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.634
l guess it's not that big of an honour
to meet Jack McKay.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.552
None of his so-called friends
showed up either.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.153
There are more waiters than guests.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.878
Well, David had to study, really.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.996
Yeah, Steve had to go
to a basketball game.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.720
Brandon had to work.
l forget what Andrea's reason was.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.154
But Bren said she'll be here.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.954
- She can't make it either.
- She said she was coming.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.315
l know. She didn't call you back?

10:14.160 --> 10:16.754
No. What?

10:17.400 --> 10:18.833
She wanted to come, really.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.195
Her dad made a big deal,
you know how it is.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.352
- Yeah, unfortunately, l do.
- Dylan.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.670
Hey, it's not important.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.038
You're here.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.429
So when are you gonna introduce me
to your father?

10:32.600 --> 10:34.670
Come on. He's gonna love you.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.592
You know you've been
in the joint way too long

10:36.760 --> 10:38.512
when you start reading
the prison newsletter

10:38.680 --> 10:41.035
for tips on how to decorate your cell.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.798
Hey, Dylan, come on over here.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.234
You remember Mickey Ga <i>rw</i> ood,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.550
- greatest lawyer in the west.
- Good to see you again.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.678
Listen, whatever you did
to get my dad out of there, thanks.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.596
- This is my friend, Kelly Taylor.
- A very beautiful Kelly Taylor.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.113
Thank you. lt's nice to meet you.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.952
Great taste, kid.
Just like your old man.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.712
Well, you better behave yourself,
Jack.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.632
- This is Christine.
- Hi.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.995
- Hi, Kelly, nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.037
Well, l better be going, Jack.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.111
Oh, Mickey, come on,
you just got here.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.713
l gotta be in court at 8 tomorrow.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.836
Oh, that's right.
Okay, well, let me show you out.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.399
- Bye, Christine.
- Bye, Mickey.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.437
Pleasure meeting you, Miss Taylor.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.318
Jack's entourage isn't as big as it was
in the old days.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.711
Your father had a lot more money
in the old days.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.792
<i>With just over 22 seconds left to play</i>
<i>in overtime,</i>

11:28.960 --> 11:31.315
<i>the Cavs holding on</i>
<i>to a slim three-point lead,</i>

11:31.480 --> 11:32.595
Come on, come on, Cavs.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.671
Let's hold them here.
Let's hold them here.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.559
- Brandon.
- Hang on, Bren.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.950
- Look, l need to talk to you.
- Can it wait?

11:40.120 --> 11:41.792
No. Kelly went to the party
at the Bel Age.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.996
- That's nice.
- Brandon.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.515
Come on, Cleveland.
Hold them here. Just hold them.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.238
Why are you rooting
against the Lakers?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.470
l'm not rooting against them,
l'm betting against them.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.835
Look, l understand why dad
wouldn't let me go to the party,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.149
but with Kelly being there--

11:54.320 --> 11:56.356
Come on, Cleveland.
Come on. Come on.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.509
Brandon.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.629
- What are you doing? Give me that.
- l need to talk to you.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.553
After the game l'll talk to you
as long as you want, Bren. l promise.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.314
What is it with you, anyway?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.948
Why are you betting on
all these basketball games?

12:10.120 --> 12:13.157
Because it's fun and it makes
it interesting, and l like it, okay?

12:13.880 --> 12:15.791
l don't smoke. l don't drink.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.598
l'm sleeping my way
through my senior year.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.751
l don't have a girlfriend.
l'm bored out of my head.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.195
This gives me little pleasure
and it's making me some money.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.634
So, what's the big deal?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.353
Oh, excuse me. Sorry l asked.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.593
<i>Goes in strong,</i> B <i>all's tipped,</i>
<i>Looking around, Perkins picks it up,</i>

12:30.760 --> 12:32.239
No, no, no.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.154
<i>A, C, Green dribbling from downtown,</i>
<i>No, Can't seem to find his</i>--

12:37.960 --> 12:39.791
Yes, we have some caviar,

12:39.960 --> 12:43.714
some smoked salmon
and pig-meat pizza.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.269
No, thanks, l'm not very hungry.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.718
Are you okay?
You don't sound so good.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.319
Stuff's going down at home.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.357
Looks like my mom's
gonna be single again.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.478
You're kidding me. l mean, l really
thought those two would make it.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.676
Unfortunately, so did my mother.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.633
- Are you okay?
- l guess so.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.395
Think l'd be used to it by now,
l've been through it enough.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.715
l just wish they'd stop fighting,
get on with the divorce.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.953
You wanna stay here
with me tonight?

13:21.840 --> 13:23.319
l can't do that.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.072
Why not?

13:25.640 --> 13:26.959
You know why not.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.272
Okay, but l've got an idea.
Let's go swimming.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.514
- Swimming?
- Yeah.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.749
l don't have a suit.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.150
So the shops are open downstairs,
we'll buy you one.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.514
lt's too cold.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.240
Kelly, the pool's heated
and l'll keep you warm.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.789
What about your father?

13:45.960 --> 13:48.110
He's got his own blonde.
He's busy. He'll never miss us.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.430
Come on. Let's go.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.870
Remember the last time
we went swimming in this pool?

14:02.400 --> 14:03.958
Mark What's-His-Name
almost drowned.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.758
He was so wasted at your party.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.150
Yeah, the good old days.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.357
l sort of remember.
l'm lucky l remember anything.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.399
This was a good idea.

14:13.840 --> 14:18.038
- l'm full of good ideas.
- Oh, l bet you are.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.913
- Don't do it unless you mean it.
- l mean it.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.632
You're in trouble then.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.355
Don't do that if you don't mean it.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.669
l mean it.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.353
Well, you're in trouble now.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.669
Dylan, what if Brenda
had come tonight?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.273
She didn't.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.113
So is that how you made up your mind,
because she's not here?

15:11.280 --> 15:13.032
Maybe.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.190
Mel and my mom are breaking up
because he was fooling around.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.113
l just can't feel that great
about being the other woman.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.953
Look, it was you two that gave me
the dumb ultimatum.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.157
You said choose. l chose.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.912
l chose you.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.117
l want you. l've always wanted you.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.037
lf we're gonna make it,
we have to tell Brenda the truth.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.312
We can't make
the same mistake again.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.313
Fine. No problem.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.476
No, l mean we have to tell her
about the summer.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.355
Kelly, telling Brenda about us
fooling around this summer,

15:49.520 --> 15:51.158
it's not gonna help anything.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.435
l know, but she's my friend.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.034
l owe it to her
to tell her the truth, you know?

15:59.200 --> 16:00.679
So do you.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.359
Okay.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.309
Donna, thank you so much.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.198
Without you,
l wouldn't know where to start.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.713
l can't afford those fancy salons.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.711
l figured, ''Who should l call?
Of course, Donna.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.518
She's an expert
at this kind of stuff.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.148
She knows exactly what to do.''
And here you are. lt's perfect.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.594
Have you picked out a colour yet?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.193
No, l don't want a colour,
not all over.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.875
l want one of those little...
You know, those little streaky things.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.314
- Highlights.
- Yes, highlights.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.391
- Do you know how to do that?
- Of course l do.

16:41.560 --> 16:45.394
l was thinking of--
l don't know, something a little--

16:45.560 --> 16:47.312
l don't know,
something a little blonde.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.790
No, no, no. Red would be much better
with your skin tone.

16:50.960 --> 16:51.949
Are you sure?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.270
Yeah, what are you worried about?

16:54.440 --> 16:55.509
l don't know.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.910
- You don't have to do it.
- No. lt's time for a change.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.308
lf l'm gonna go off to Yale,

16:59.480 --> 17:01.516
l'm not gonna go there looking
like some geek.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.830
- Andrea, you are not a geek.
- Yeah, well,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.069
going to that spa with you guys
taught me something.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.674
Beauty may be skin deep,
but it's no sin to be beautiful.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.159
Good.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.551
Still, l don't know.
lt's such a big change.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.395
Andrea, it's not plastic surgery.
lt's a hair colour.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.233
lf you don't like it,
you'll change it back.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.277
You make it sound so easy.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.839
Well, it is. Trust me.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.912
You're gonna be gorgeous,
here and at Yale.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.954
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.155
Take care.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.949
- Shouldn't we wait for Christine?
- No, no, let her sleep.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.270
Nice spread.
Who's picking up the tab?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.950
Well, you might as well know.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.917
Between the fines and the lawyers,
l'm wiped out.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.640
But l did stash a little bit away
where no one could find it.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.631
- Just a little bit?
- Just a little.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.030
Just a little, not much,
so enjoy it while it lasts.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.679
What are you gonna do
when it runs out?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.273
l'm gonna make some more,
that's what.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.718
You make it sound pretty easy.
lt's not the '80s anymore.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.396
So you're a financial expert now,
is that it?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.516
No, far from it.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.477
Well, maybe you ought
to become one.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.637
That trust fund of yours
is pretty hefty, Dylan.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.360
Might as well know what you're doing
when it comes to investments.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.078
l'm not interested in investments.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.912
Besides,
Jim Walsh takes care of all that.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.509
ls he doing a good job?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.877
- l get a cheque every month.
- l know, but is he doing a good job?

18:22.040 --> 18:25.350
l wouldn't worry. l mean, l'm sure
it's very safe, very conservative.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.635
That's just the way Jim is.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.837
l'm sure he is, Dylan,
but is he doing a good job?

18:30.320 --> 18:33.073
- l don't know.
- That's exactly what l'm talking about.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.789
Did you read this?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.712
''Jack McKay's release
from federal prison

18:38.880 --> 18:40.996
only marks the end
of his criminal prosecution.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.913
Over 300 lawsuits have been filed
in civil court,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.878
the first due to come
to trial in the next three months.''

18:47.040 --> 18:49.554
Jack McKay's gonna be a busy man.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.479
Wonder how much dough
he's got stashed away.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.709
Paper says he's broke.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.156
- Morning, honey.
- Hi.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.880
Brandon already left for school.
Want me to give you a ride?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.109
No, thanks, l'll walk.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.633
Brenda,
are you mad about last night?

19:07.760 --> 19:10.320
As a matter of fact, yes.
Kelly went to the party.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.550
Apparently, her mother
didn't have a problem with her

19:12.720 --> 19:13.994
meeting the evil Jack McKay.

19:14.440 --> 19:18.228
Honey, Kelly's mother has a lot
of other things on her mind right now.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.799
And you're not Kelly Taylor.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.555
l know l'm not.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.993
Excuse me.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.713
Hello?

19:30.720 --> 19:33.837
Well, yes, he is.
Just a minute, please?

19:34.360 --> 19:37.591
Jim, it's Jack McKay.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.949
- Hello.
- <i>Mr, Walsh?</i>

19:48.120 --> 19:50.350
- Speaking.
- l just wanted to introduce myself

19:50.520 --> 19:52.750
to the man who's been taking care
of business for my son.

19:53.640 --> 19:54.629
What can l do for you?

19:54.800 --> 19:57.268
Well, l just thought we ought
to get together, you know?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.998
The sooner the better.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.149
All right.
Why don't you call my office?

20:02.320 --> 20:03.639
My secretary can set something up.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.552
Terrific, okay, l'll look fo <i>rw</i> ard to it.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.676
- <i>Goodbye, Mr, McKay,</i>
- Goodbye, Mr. Walsh.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.119
- What did he want?
- A meeting.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.553
- About Dylan's money?
- He didn't say.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.672
Dad, what's going on?

20:22.840 --> 20:25.035
First of all, l don't know.
And second of all,

20:25.200 --> 20:28.351
business between me and a client
is confidential.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.676
Mom, l don't like this.
l'm really worried about Dylan.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.434
Honey, l'm sure your father
will look out for Dylan.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.033
That's what a trustee does.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.156
Look, you heard what dad said.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.153
Jack McKay is a very powerful guy.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.958
And if you were him
and you were broke

20:46.120 --> 20:47.394
and your son had all that money,

20:47.560 --> 20:49.630
wouldn't you want
to get your hands on it?

20:53.440 --> 20:54.634
What happened, Dad?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.876
l blew it, David.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.276
So that's it?
That's all you can say?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.596
There's nothing more to say.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.955
l'm going apartment hunting
this afternoon.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.596
So it's definitely over?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.469
David, l tried.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.758
l really tried, but l have a problem
with monogamy.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.876
l can't just be with one woman.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.314
l made a big mistake

21:19.480 --> 21:21.710
and now l have to pay
the consequences.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.639
This feels like deja vu.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.432
David, l'm sorry. l am really sorry.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.190
l wish that you didn't have
to go through this,

21:31.520 --> 21:34.318
but we have some details
we have to work out.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.913
l'm not moving to Portland, Dad.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.638
Who said anything about Portland?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.957
l'll get a two-bedroom
here in Beverly Hills.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.792
You can stay here
until you graduate in June.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.791
- Oh, that's real big of you.
- David.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.473
What about Erin?

21:45.640 --> 21:48.632
Look, l will always be Erin's father.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.233
And you will always be
Erin's brother.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.311
Oh, come on, when,
on Sundays at the zoo

21:52.480 --> 21:54.869
with all the other divorced dads?
That's not enough for me.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.119
David, l'm sorry.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.998
l don't understand
why l have to lose a sister

21:59.160 --> 22:01.720
because you can't keep your hands
off some girl in a white uniform.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.395
David...

22:03.560 --> 22:05.039
Look, l gotta go to school.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.430
l hope you find
a real nice apartment, Dad.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.350
l think you look great
in your bathing suit.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.192
Thank you.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.154
l mean, you're just beautiful
all around, you know?

22:25.320 --> 22:27.151
Would you stop? We're at school.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.073
Oh, Kel.
Listen, Kel, my dad really liked you

22:30.240 --> 22:32.276
and he wanted me to invite you
to dinner again tonight

22:32.440 --> 22:34.635
with Christine, him, myself.
What do you think?

22:34.800 --> 22:37.360
- l don't know.
- Well, didn't you have a good time?

22:37.520 --> 22:41.593
Yeah, yeah, l did.
l just-- l couldn't sleep last night.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.432
- l kept thinking about Brenda and--
- Hey.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.794
How are we gonna tell her?
What are we gonna tell her?

22:48.160 --> 22:51.789
Kel, that's not really the kind of thing
that you rehearse.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.151
She's right there.
You can tell right now if you want to.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.833
Hi, guys. How was the party?

22:59.320 --> 23:01.072
lt was fine.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.470
Dylan, look,
l'm really sorry l couldn't come.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.359
- lt's okay.
- l just had to study, that's all.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.395
Right.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.074
Listen, l'm late for class.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.519
Kelly,

23:19.920 --> 23:22.115
you didn't tell Dylan
what my dad said, did you?

23:22.280 --> 23:23.474
No, of course not.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.678
l should have been there.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.910
Dylan needs friends right now.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.116
Especially friends
who understand how bad it is

23:31.280 --> 23:32.395
between him and his father.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.879
You've met Dylan's dad?

23:34.360 --> 23:35.918
Yeah, the first time Dylan and l
went out,

23:36.080 --> 23:37.274
he took me back to the Bel Age.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.399
Jack started screaming
and Dylan went right for the bottle.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.395
Well, either Dylan's stronger
or Jack's a lot mellower,

23:44.560 --> 23:46.391
because it wasn't
anything like that last night.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.949
Jack told the funniest story
about how they used to order up

23:49.120 --> 23:51.793
ten banana splits from Room Service
and see who could eat the most.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.592
Well, l don't think
all of Dylan's memories

23:54.760 --> 23:55.954
are quite that adorable.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.231
Well, he wants to give
his dad a chance.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.913
And l think that's great.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.917
Yeah, l guess. l'll talk to you later.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.113
You should have been there
last night.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.236
l'm telling you, l was sitting
behind Jack Nicholson.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.039
l'm just glad the Cavs covered
the spread those last few minutes--

24:17.200 --> 24:19.031
Hey, guys,
glad you could make it last night.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.714
Thank you very much. Remind me
to return the favour sometime.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.750
Dylan, if l'd known
it was that important to you--

24:24.920 --> 24:26.512
You'd have gone
to the game, anyway, Steve.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.190
Hey, l'm sorry, man,
l just couldn't get off work.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.713
Oh, it's okay. l know how it is.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.440
l mean, Nat couldn't possibly get by
without you for one night.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.955
- Come on, Dylan.
- l know what you're talking about.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.712
Your dad doesn't want you
or your sister

24:37.880 --> 24:40.872
within 50 feet of my old man.
He's a convicted felon.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.389
lt's not true.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.198
Nice to know
who your friends are.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.152
Dylan.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.118
Okay, that's the last piece.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.875
- Now we wait 20 minutes and wash.
- Okay.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.598
You look like a human Jell-O mould.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.320
One more comment like that
and you're out the door, all right?

25:11.480 --> 25:14.358
l don't care how l look now.
lt's later that l'm worried about.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.193
lf your hair turns out the colour
of that stuff, you're in big trouble.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.679
You're a big help.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.673
l'm sorry. l shouldn't even be here.
l should be at home packing.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.398
David, it's not gonna happen
that fast.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.994
Yes, it is. As soon as he finds a place,
he's moving.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.152
David, look, l might sound naive,

25:32.320 --> 25:34.880
but why can't you just stay
with Kelly and Jackie?

25:35.400 --> 25:38.312
Andrea, you are naive.
Jackie is divorcing my father.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.038
She's not gonna want me around.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.998
l'd be nothing but a reminder
of all the rotten things he did to her.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.516
That is not true. Jackie likes you.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.591
She knows this isn't your fault.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.557
Trust me, she wouldn't go for it.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.917
And even if she did,
my dad wouldn't allow it.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.838
Well, how do you know
if you don't ask?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.752
She's right.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.108
Brandon, just got a soda delivery in.
Would you help Willie?

26:06.280 --> 26:08.794
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Hey, did Duke stop by yet?

26:08.960 --> 26:11.793
- What?
- Duke. He owes me 1 00 bucks.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.831
Oh, God, Brandon.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.355
l forgot to place the bet.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.958
You forgot?

26:20.560 --> 26:21.549
l feel terrible.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.631
l mean, you know,
things got so busy last night.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.594
l forgot to call. l'm sorry.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.633
l don't believe it.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.519
- You sure he forgot to place the bet?
- Steve, don't even think it.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.796
Well, did he ever forget
to place a bet when you lost?

26:44.120 --> 26:46.475
Here take this. This is the hundred
you would have won.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.153
Nat, l can't take that.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.476
Come on, l feel terrible.
Let me make it up to you.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.119
Okay.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.395
But not with money.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.399
Okay, what do you want?

26:58.240 --> 26:59.798
l want Duke's phone number, Nat.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.032
l'm a big boy. lt doesn't make sense
for you to be booking my bets for me.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.428
Oh, l don't know, Brandon.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.079
Come on, Nat,
it's just a phone number.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.276
l'm not going to be passing it out
around school.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.874
That's not what l'm talking about.

27:11.040 --> 27:15.397
You letting me book your bets,
l get to keep an eye on you.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.711
But on your own,

27:17.880 --> 27:18.949
it makes me nervous.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.873
Nat. Nat, it's me here.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.396
Brandon Walsh. Honours English.
Never been late for work.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.232
- Boy Scout.
- Boy Scout.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.833
What are you worried about?

27:31.880 --> 27:34.189
Thank you for agreeing to meet
with us so quickly, Mr. Walsh.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.873
No problem.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.589
What can l do for you?

27:38.760 --> 27:40.352
Well, l just have some questions.

27:40.680 --> 27:41.999
Dylan and l have talked it over

27:42.160 --> 27:45.072
and Dylan wants to explore
his legal options vis-a-vis the trust.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.871
l want my dad
to manage my money, Jim.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.192
That's not possible.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.877
Given that your father was convicted
on federal racketeering charges,

27:58.360 --> 28:00.749
his current legal status, l'm afraid,
would preclude him

28:00.920 --> 28:03.309
from serving
as a licensed money manager

28:03.480 --> 28:05.072
or a competent trustee.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.595
l'm not talking about
managing the trust, Mr. Walsh.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.796
l am talking about
dissolving the trust.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.796
l think Dylan's mother
may have a problem with that.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.475
She established an irrevocable trust,

28:16.640 --> 28:19.313
whereby the money will stay there
until Dylan's 21 st birthday.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.353
Dylan,

28:22.920 --> 28:25.514
how about letting Mr. Walsh and me
have a couple minutes alone?

28:29.560 --> 28:31.039
All right.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.949
Mr. Walsh,

28:47.160 --> 28:49.310
l want to thank you very much
for looking after my son

28:49.480 --> 28:52.597
when l wasn't around,
but now that l'm here,

28:52.760 --> 28:55.069
well, l'm afraid your services
are no longer necessary.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.190
- You can't fire me.
- You're right, Mr. Walsh, l can't.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.396
But you and l both know
it only takes three signatures

29:02.560 --> 29:04.312
to open up
that so-called irrevocable trust

29:04.480 --> 29:06.516
and release all that money.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.995
Yours, my ex-wife's and Dylan's.

29:10.040 --> 29:14.989
And if lris signs, you can hardly stand
in the way, can you, Jim?

29:15.760 --> 29:18.513
l cannot, in good faith, support this.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.240
You're talking about protecting him
from his own father.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.912
Perhaps.

29:25.640 --> 29:29.235
l feel fairly certain that your ex-wife
will never go along with this.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.868
Well, why don't we just call her
and find out?

29:33.080 --> 29:34.752
l mean, after all,
l think l know lris McKay

29:34.920 --> 29:36.433
just a little bit better than you do.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.879
Jim?

29:41.680 --> 29:44.035
Hey, Bren,
have you seen my calculator?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.395
What would l be doing
with your calculator?

29:46.560 --> 29:47.788
l left it on my desk.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.799
l haven't been in your room,
Brandon,

29:50.960 --> 29:53.030
and l would appreciate it
if you stay out of mine.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.794
All right, l'll bite. What's the matter?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.473
Nothing.
l'm surprised you're studying.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.437
lsn't there a basketball game on
or something?

30:00.440 --> 30:02.510
Look, Bren,
l'm sorry l blew you off last night,

30:02.680 --> 30:05.399
but the game went into overtime.
Forgive me.

30:06.680 --> 30:07.954
Yeah, sure.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.271
Bren, just because dad wouldn't let
you go to Dylan's little party,

30:11.440 --> 30:12.998
don't take it out on me.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.989
l could have gone to that party
if l wanted to.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.957
Then why didn't you?

30:19.720 --> 30:20.914
What if dad's right?

30:22.920 --> 30:25.593
What if Dylan's father is,
like, a major bad guy?

30:27.680 --> 30:29.079
Yeah, l know what you mean.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.674
l was actually kind of glad
l had to work last night.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.031
You know, no matter how close
Dylan and l got,

30:36.200 --> 30:38.839
there was always a part of him
that l could never understand.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.752
And now with his father
back in the picture,

30:41.920 --> 30:43.478
it seems like he's even more distant.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.992
Yeah, l know.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.713
Maybe the rich are different.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.479
Sparkling cider. Don't let anybody say
l'm corrupting my son.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.358
What are we toasting to, anyway?

30:59.520 --> 31:02.876
We are toasting to you and me.
My brains, your money, sky is the limit.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.198
Aren't you being a little premature?
lris hasn't signed anything yet.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.875
Oh, she'll sign, Dylan.
Believe me, she'll sign.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.349
Would y'all excuse me?
l just need to finish my hair.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.794
lt looks finished to me.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.669
Oh, what do men know, anyway?
Excuse me.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.199
Hello.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.594
Hang on.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.193
l'm gonna take this
in the other room.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.033
Just make yourselves comfortable.
lt'll just take a minute.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.520
lt sounds like your meeting
with Brenda's dad went very well.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.159
lt depends who you talk to.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.753
My dad,
he hears what he wants to hear.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.319
lt's all up to my mom.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.755
You don't sound very enthusiastic
about the whole thing.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.868
l just care more about my old man
than l do the money.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.600
lf this will bring us closer,
l'll go along for the ride.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.516
Listen to me,
l told you l'm doing the best l can.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.829
These things take time.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.149
Are you ready?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.469
Yeah, honey, l'll be right out.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.076
- Just keep them entertained, okay?
- Okay.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.948
Look,
l told you everything is under control.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.395
Yes, we will get the money out
of the trust. A deal's a deal.

32:05.560 --> 32:08.757
Now, you back off
until you hear from me, you got that?

32:09.080 --> 32:10.354
Good.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.079
l had a very good time tonight.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.708
l told you so.
Although l would like to try it

32:27.880 --> 32:29.791
without my dad and Christine
sometime.

32:29.960 --> 32:33.873
Kind of like to get you alone,
all to myself.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.956
lt's getting a little late. You sure
you don't wanna stay with me?

32:42.440 --> 32:45.238
No. l've promised myself
not until we tell Brenda.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.077
Which we had the perfect opportunity
to do today at school.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.236
What if she stops
talking to me again?

32:53.680 --> 32:54.749
What do you want?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.911
You wanna pretend
there's nothing going on between us

32:57.080 --> 32:59.150
just so Brenda
will keep talking to us?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.274
No.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.433
So we'll tell her tomorrow.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.992
Together, after school.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.749
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.912
Where have you been?

33:29.080 --> 33:30.274
Do you know what time it is?

33:31.720 --> 33:34.871
Yeah, l told you l was going out
with Dylan and his father for dinner.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.678
Till 2:00 in the morning?

33:38.760 --> 33:40.273
Since when do you wait up?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.709
l wasn't really waiting up.
l couldn't sleep.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.279
Did Mel leave?

33:49.440 --> 33:53.558
Yeah, he's staying in a hotel
until he can find an apartment.

33:53.720 --> 33:54.835
Probably with his girlfriend.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.070
Mom, l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have gone out tonight.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.630
No, no, no. lt's bad enough
you have to go through this at all.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.439
l don't want you putting your life
on hold because of me.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.552
Did you have fun?

34:06.560 --> 34:07.993
Yeah, l did.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.435
l can't believe Dylan and l
are finally together.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.150
Well, at least one of us
is lucky in love, huh?

34:15.320 --> 34:16.753
Yeah, l guess so.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.797
What about Brenda?

34:20.120 --> 34:21.757
She doesn't know yet.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.954
Come here. Oh, come here.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.992
David.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.193
Oh, l'll go get a bottle.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.509
l already got one.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.388
Well, thank you.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.428
You don't have to thank me.
She's my sister, too, you know?

34:40.880 --> 34:44.190
Yes, she is.
And you're doing a great job.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.554
l'm already starting to miss it.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.597
Her crying in the middle of the nights,

34:48.760 --> 34:51.558
her smiling in the morning
while she's spitting Cream of Wheat.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.632
Mom, why does David have to go?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.638
He doesn't.

35:03.960 --> 35:07.430
- What?
- Erin is your sister.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.797
Her home is your home.
You can stay as long as you like.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.353
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah, l do.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.352
Me too. You belong here.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.397
Well, what about my parents?
What do l tell them?

35:19.320 --> 35:20.912
l'll talk to Mel.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.832
God knows he owes me something.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.195
l think it's time l start collecting,
don't you?

35:36.320 --> 35:38.197
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.717
- Can l talk to you for a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.916
Do you wanna go to a movie tonight
or something?

35:44.080 --> 35:46.833
l can't, Bren,
l've got plans with my dad.

35:49.320 --> 35:52.118
- Well, maybe another night, then.
- Maybe.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.831
Dylan, what's the matter?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.230
Nothing. l just got
a lot of things on my mind.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.110
Look, if it's because l didn't go
to the party, l'm sorry,

36:00.280 --> 36:02.350
but let's not let your dad and my dad
come between us.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.557
lt's just business, Bren.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.159
Okay.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.878
l better get to class.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.711
- Well?
- lt looks great.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.758
- You look gorgeous.
- You think so?

36:28.920 --> 36:32.356
- Stunning.
- Oh, thanks, you guys. l gotta go.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.436
Donna, her hair
doesn't look any different.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.319
What? lt looks highlighty.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.553
Well, whatever you say,
l didn't see it.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.191
Then why'd you tell her
how gorgeous she looked?

36:44.360 --> 36:46.112
My dad always taught me
that beautiful women

36:46.280 --> 36:47.633
like to be told that they're smart,

36:47.800 --> 36:50.075
and smart women
like to be told that they're beautiful.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.593
So, what am l?

36:51.760 --> 36:54.513
You're smart and beautiful.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.269
Do me a favour, David.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.954
Don't take anymore advice
from your father about women, okay?

37:00.120 --> 37:01.917
- Okay.
- Thanks.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.150
How'd you do last night
with all that action going on?

37:04.320 --> 37:05.878
l did pretty well.
Thank you, my friend.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.270
l'm meeting Dukie later on tonight
to pick up my winnings.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.635
One hundred American dollars.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.109
Now, do you still think basketball's
a sucker's bet?

37:13.280 --> 37:15.669
As a matter of fact,
yes, l do, Brandon.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.348
Hi, guys.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.829
- Hi, Andrea.
- Hi, Andrea.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.754
- Bye, Andrea.
- Hey, Steve.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.638
Why don't you stop by
the Peach Pit later on?

37:26.800 --> 37:28.279
Help me count all my cash.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.789
Yeah.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.111
So, Steve,
you notice anything different?

37:36.120 --> 37:38.680
- You got new glasses?
- No.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.432
A new vest?

37:41.120 --> 37:42.348
No.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.919
You did it, huh?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.352
So you like it?

37:50.840 --> 37:52.751
What? What did she do?

37:53.080 --> 37:55.958
Well, it's definitely not that radical,
but it looks good on you.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.109
Thank you, Steve.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.437
What did you do? What did she do?

38:00.400 --> 38:01.879
Nothing.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.997
Men.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.509
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.758
Listen, B, l want to apologise to you

38:24.920 --> 38:26.956
for busting your chops
about that party thing.

38:27.720 --> 38:31.156
That's okay. l probably
could have twisted Nat's arm.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.469
The truth is, l didn't.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.272
Anyway, you don't have to prove to me
anything about our friendship.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.793
Man, you've already done that.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.076
Yeah, same here.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.638
Look, l don't think you're gonna be
seeing me around your house much.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.873
Why? What's going on?
Are you okay?

38:50.200 --> 38:53.192
l'm fine. lt's just l don't think Bren's
gonna want to see me for a while

38:53.360 --> 38:55.032
or talk to me
or hear anything about me.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.714
And l didn't want you to think
that l was avoiding you.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.440
So it's finally over, huh? Again.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.513
Yeah, this is it.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.313
Okay.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.233
Do me a favour?

39:10.360 --> 39:13.193
Look out for your sister, man.
She'll need it.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.559
Hi.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.995
- Hi.
- What's going on?

39:28.160 --> 39:29.878
We need to talk to you.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.952
Come on in.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.191
Why don't we take a walk instead?

39:37.400 --> 39:39.038
Let me get my jacket.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.788
Okay, let's go.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.593
Brenda, please try to understand
how much you mean to us, all right?

39:58.760 --> 40:01.479
l know this is hard for you, Bren.
lt's hard for all of us.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.790
Don't touch me.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.993
Dylan, you have made your choice

40:06.160 --> 40:08.276
l have to live with that
and l should've seen it coming,

40:08.440 --> 40:11.432
but l don't have to listen to it anymore.
l'm going home, okay?

40:11.600 --> 40:13.909
No, Brenda, we need to tell you
something else.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.832
Well, l don't wanna hear it.
l've heard enough.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.115
You're gonna have to, Bren,

40:17.280 --> 40:19.635
because neither of us
can stand to lie to you anymore.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.470
This summer,
while you were in Paris--

40:23.840 --> 40:26.434
Look, l told you
l was with a girl, right?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.113
Kelly was the girl.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.152
l thought you guys
were my friends?

40:33.760 --> 40:35.398
l loved you. l trusted you both.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.710
- Brenda, please.
- We didn't plan this, Bren.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.758
No, of course you didn't plan it, Dylan,
you just let it happen.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.431
And you lied to me, both of you,
for months and months.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.797
When l broke up with you,
you made it seem

40:47.960 --> 40:50.599
like Kelly was just some girl
you picked to go out with.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.910
You made it seem so innocent,
like it was my fault.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.913
Neither of us wanted to hurt you.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.476
You didn't care
about how l felt at all, Kelly.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.153
That's not true.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.755
- Did you two sleep together?
- No.

41:06.760 --> 41:07.909
And why should l believe you?

41:08.080 --> 41:10.310
Because it's the truth.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.316
Why are you doing this to me?

41:13.480 --> 41:15.755
Because we owe it to you, Bren.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.753
Don't you think that we all owe
ourselves something more than this,

41:18.920 --> 41:20.751
that we can start again
from some place honest?

41:20.920 --> 41:23.718
Honesty? ls that what you think
this is about, Dylan?

41:24.600 --> 41:26.511
l don't think so.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.395
Look, l hate you both.
Never talk to me again.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.151
She'll be all right.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.278
l hope so.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.159
Will we?
