She says I have

03:37.384 --> 03:39.386

03:39.427 --> 03:41.180
she shows a film

No. I don't think I can sleep.

What's the problem?

06:18.253 --> 06:20.839
It's me and Steve.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.008
I mean, you should see

06:23.050 --> 06:27.846
You have to pry 'em apart

06:27.888 --> 06:30.098
Steve and I

06:27.888 --> 06:30.098
used to be like that.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.767
We never wanted

06:30.140 --> 06:32.767
to be apart for a minute.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.102
Well, you know, it's normal

06:34.144 --> 06:36.563
for a relationship

06:34.144 --> 06:36.563
to go through stages.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.023
I mean, the first stage

06:36.604 --> 06:38.023
is always hot

06:38.065 --> 06:39.900
because it's new.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.568
And when it's not so new?

06:41.609 --> 06:42.694
Well..

06:42.736 --> 06:43.737
...then you have to find out

06:43.778 --> 06:44.946
if you have more going on

06:44.988 --> 06:46.573
than just the initial

06:44.988 --> 06:46.573
attraction.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.325
You'll find out if

06:46.614 --> 06:48.325
you have the same interests.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.744
Yeah, but you and Uncle Jesse

06:48.367 --> 06:50.744
have been together forever

06:50.785 --> 06:52.954
and you're still hot

06:50.785 --> 06:52.954
for each other.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.123
That's one of our interests.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.257
Deej, Come on.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.257
It's gonna be a great party.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.675
I can't. Steve's gonna

07:03.298 --> 07:05.675
call from L.A.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.011
Besides, I would feel

07:05.717 --> 07:08.011
weird by myself.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.638
You won't be by yourself.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.638
You'll be with us.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.599
You'll be making out

07:10.680 --> 07:12.599
all night.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.559
Well, we'll need

07:12.640 --> 07:14.559
a spotter.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.979
I'll pass.

Then at least come

07:18.021 --> 07:19.439

Yeah. We're gonna climb

07:46.674 --> 07:48.260
notes on this, sweetie.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.262
You know how every week Joey

07:48.302 --> 07:50.262
goes and he buys

07:50.304 --> 07:52.973
those lottery tickets and thinks

07:50.304 --> 07:52.973
he's gonna make the big score?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.267
Well this time, we're gonna

07:53.014 --> 07:55.267
make him think that he did.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.852
Well, that's kind of cruel.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.687
Exactly.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.649
Now, your mission, should

07:59.729 --> 08:02.649
you choose to accept it

08:02.690 --> 08:04.484
is to tape the lottery show

08:02.690 --> 08:04.484
tonight

08:04.525 --> 08:06.486
and then we're gonna go out

08:04.525 --> 08:06.486
and get the same numbers

08:06.527 --> 08:08.655
and then I'm going to switch

08:06.527 --> 08:08.655
that ticket with Joey's ticket.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.449
And then the next time Joey sits

08:08.696 --> 08:10.449
down to watch the lotto drawing

08:10.490 --> 08:12.033
we play the tape.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.786
The numbers match exactly,

08:12.075 --> 08:14.786
he thinks he's a zillionaire

08:14.828 --> 08:17.580
and it's shaft city.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.666
Then we tell him

08:17.622 --> 08:19.666
he didn't win

08:19.707 --> 08:22.085
and laugh at him,

08:19.707 --> 08:22.085
like he laughed at us.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.712
No, no, no, no.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.712
We laugh much harder.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.888
Well, it looks like you're

08:31.386 --> 08:33.888
my Saturday night dates.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.973
What do you want to do?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.058
I want to play farmer.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.978
Come on, D.J.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.897
You be a goat.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.649
Be a goat.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.278
I'm a go-o-oat.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.571
I'm a go-o-oat.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.408
[telephone ringing]

08:55.202 --> 08:57.120
Hello-o-o-o.. Ahem.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.499
- Hello?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.499
- 'D.J?'

09:00.540 --> 09:02.709
Steve. How's L.A.?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.085
It's incredible, Deej.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.586
They took us to this

09:04.127 --> 09:05.586
beautiful restaurant

09:05.628 --> 09:06.629
here in Beverly Hills.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.382
There are stars everywhere.

09:08.423 --> 09:12.260
Listen to this. I actually met

09:08.423 --> 09:12.260
Tom Cruise's dental hygienist.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.678
And I've been seeing

09:12.302 --> 09:13.678
the greatest films

09:13.720 --> 09:15.389
by these awesome directors.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.850
Deej, I can't tell you, it's

09:15.430 --> 09:18.850
been so amazingly stimulating.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.268
'So, well, what have

09:18.892 --> 09:20.268
you been up to?'

09:21.853 --> 09:25.732
Well...I've been making

09:21.853 --> 09:25.732
really neat goat sounds.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.153
Excuse me.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.910
Do you mind

09:35.033 --> 09:36.910
if I use the phone?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.037
My flip phone died.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.706
D.J.!

09:41.748 --> 09:44.125
Suzanne Somers

09:41.748 --> 09:44.125
just touched me.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.213
I gotta go, okay?

09:45.877 --> 09:48.213
I love this town!

09:49.423 --> 09:50.465
Steve?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.342
It's all yours, Miss Somers.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.843
Oh, and if I may say so

09:53.885 --> 09:55.470
thanks to that Thighmaster

09:53.885 --> 09:55.470
of yours

09:55.512 --> 09:57.472
my mom's got the cutest buns

09:55.512 --> 09:57.472
on the whole block.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.973
Really?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.101
How nice for your dad.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.562
Thanks.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.562
Thank you.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.024
I stayed home for that?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.776
What am I doing with my life?

10:09.817 --> 10:11.736
I don't know.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.990
Well, I'm not waitin'

10:13.863 --> 10:15.990
around for anybody.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.159
I'm going to that party.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.287
Bye-bye, D.J.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.956
Have fun.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.749
I intend to.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.548
Okay, tonight,

10:28.669 --> 10:31.548
I'm babysitting..

10:31.590 --> 10:33.758
...but tomorrow

10:31.590 --> 10:33.758
is a brand-new day.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.063
Kimmy, you're doing great.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.189
You must be part mountain goat.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.732
Could be.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.651
You know,

10:49.774 --> 10:51.651
when my grandfather got mad

10:51.692 --> 10:53.987
he used to lower his head

10:51.692 --> 10:53.987
and ram people.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.574
Oh, D.J.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.534
- Uhh!

10:57.616 --> 10:59.534
- Oh!

10:59.576 --> 11:01.495
Doesn't she just

10:59.576 --> 11:01.495
crack you up?

11:01.536 --> 11:04.205
Yeah. Remind me to laugh

11:01.536 --> 11:04.205
if we ever make it back down.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.000
Whoa.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.919
We're really high.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.172
Aren't you guys

11:09.961 --> 11:12.172
scared at all?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.299
I'm too dumb to be scared.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.717
Okay, just a little more

11:16.759 --> 11:18.761
and we'll be at the top.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.138
We're going up that?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.931
It's a lot easier

11:20.180 --> 11:21.931
than it looks.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.350
And there's hand and footholds

11:21.973 --> 11:23.350
all the way up.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.977
'Just follow me.'

11:29.272 --> 11:31.690
I love this view!

11:31.732 --> 11:33.943
I could watch him

11:31.732 --> 11:33.943
climb all day.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.904
Kimmy!

11:36.946 --> 11:39.407
Forget the view! You almost

11:36.946 --> 11:39.407
fell off the mountain!

11:40.325 --> 11:42.160
Yeah, but what a way to go.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.621
'You girls comin' up?'

11:44.663 --> 11:46.831
Be right there, lover boy!

11:49.292 --> 11:50.877
I can't move.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.046
I'm too scared.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.964
Why did I ever do this?

11:55.006 --> 11:57.217
Well...you said you didn't

11:55.006 --> 11:57.217
wanna be stuck at home

11:57.258 --> 11:58.968
while Steve's out

11:57.258 --> 11:58.968
sharing phones

11:59.010 --> 12:01.888
with the rich

11:59.010 --> 12:01.888
and the sexy.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.765
Yeah, but I don't wanna be stuck

12:01.929 --> 12:04.765
on this ledge, either.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.601
Deej, you gotta

12:04.807 --> 12:06.601
face this fear.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.811
I mean, what's the worst

12:06.643 --> 12:08.811
that could happen to you?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.938
Well..

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
...I could fall

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
and be splattered

12:13.149 --> 12:14.568
into thousands of little pieces

12:14.609 --> 12:16.444
on these very hard

12:14.609 --> 12:16.444
pointy rocks.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.821
There you go.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.501
A hand, please.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.753
Kimmy!

12:34.795 --> 12:36.631
- D.J., I've got you. Here.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.631
- Oh!

12:36.673 --> 12:38.717
Give me your hand.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.051
- Ahh.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.051
- Whoo.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.345
Deej, you did it!

12:42.387 --> 12:45.348
I did do it!

12:42.387 --> 12:45.348
I conquered my fear!

12:47.141 --> 12:48.935
God..

12:48.976 --> 12:50.144
Look at this view!

12:50.186 --> 12:52.647
'It's, uh..

12:50.186 --> 12:52.647
You can see forever!'

12:52.689 --> 12:54.107
This is spectacular!

12:54.148 --> 12:56.317
I feel like I'm on top

12:54.148 --> 12:56.317
of the world!

12:56.359 --> 12:58.319
Deej, will you stop yakkin'?

12:58.361 --> 13:00.238
You're killing the mood.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.409
I can't believe

13:01.906 --> 13:04.409
I almost missed this.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.620
You know,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.620
in some weird way

13:06.661 --> 13:08.663
Kimmy, I couldn't have

13:06.661 --> 13:08.663
done this without you.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.374
Hey, you taught me how

13:08.705 --> 13:11.374
to shave my pits.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.211
What goes around

13:13.126 --> 13:15.211
comes around.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.847
Hi, D.J.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.100
Steve. What are you

13:26.889 --> 13:29.100
doing here?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.728
Oh, nothing.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.728
Just waiting around..

13:31.770 --> 13:33.438
...for about three hours!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.523
I came home today.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.523
We had a date, remember?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.692
Oh, it's Saturday.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.319
You're home from L.A.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.861
I don't know what

13:39.360 --> 13:40.861
happened to this week.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.238
I've been so busy.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.616
Well, thanks. It's nice

13:42.280 --> 13:44.616
to know you missed me.

13:44.658 --> 13:48.453
Oh, I'm sorry. I've just been

13:44.658 --> 13:48.453
doing so much stuff.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.038
You know, I even got to hang out

13:48.495 --> 13:51.038
with Steph and Michelle.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.124
'I forgot how much

13:51.080 --> 13:53.124
I liked them.'

13:53.166 --> 13:55.251
Did you forget

13:53.166 --> 13:55.251
you had a boyfriend?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.796
No..

13:57.836 --> 14:00.173
...but my whole life doesn't

13:57.836 --> 14:00.173
revolve around you.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.509
Yeah. It revolves around us.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.597
Uh, we'll be upstairs

14:05.261 --> 14:07.597
if you need us.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.268
You know, I know

14:10.308 --> 14:12.268
what this is about.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.895
You're trying to get back at me

14:12.310 --> 14:14.895
for going to L.A.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.898
Steve, I'm not trying

14:14.937 --> 14:17.898
to get back at you.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.818
Man, you share one phone

14:17.940 --> 14:19.818
with Suzanne Somers

14:19.859 --> 14:22.570
and you think you're

14:19.859 --> 14:22.570
Mr. Hollywood.

14:22.612 --> 14:26.115
I cannot believe that you are

14:22.612 --> 14:26.115
jealous of me and Suzanne.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.660
Jealous?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.328
Steve..

14:30.370 --> 14:31.871
...go home.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.250
Okay, alright.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.250
I'm goin' home.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.336
But it's not because

14:36.292 --> 14:38.336
you told me to!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.547
It's because my mom said

14:38.378 --> 14:40.547
not to be late for dinner.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.967
And I don't intend to be!

14:47.762 --> 14:50.473
Okay, Joe-Joe. Time for

14:47.762 --> 14:50.473
the big lottery drawing.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.891
Okay, Michelle,

14:50.515 --> 14:51.891
turn off the TV

14:51.932 --> 14:53.476
and then turn on the tape.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.730
Joey, Joey,

14:53.518 --> 14:56.730
be with your family

14:56.771 --> 14:58.439
the people who love you.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.816
What's everybody doing here?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.108
You guys are always tellin' me

14:59.858 --> 15:01.108
how dumb I am

15:01.150 --> 15:02.694
for buying lottery tickets.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.111
Oh, not today, Joey.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.655
We are here to cheer you on.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.324
Yeah. It is your lucky day,

15:05.697 --> 15:08.324
buddy.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.618
Michelle, turn the sound up.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.119
(male announcer on TV)

15:10.660 --> 15:12.119
'And here are the numbers

15:10.660 --> 15:12.119
in this week's'

15:12.161 --> 15:15.122
'Super Lotto

15:12.161 --> 15:15.122
$50 million jackpot.'

15:15.164 --> 15:16.541
'Fourteen.'

15:16.583 --> 15:17.958
Hey, I actually got one.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.168
'Five.'

15:19.210 --> 15:20.336
Yes.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.504
'Twenty nine.'

15:21.546 --> 15:22.672
Yes.

15:22.714 --> 15:23.840
'Forty one.'

15:24.340 --> 15:25.592
Yes.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.634
'Twenty three.'

15:26.676 --> 15:28.177
Oh, my God, yes!

15:28.219 --> 15:29.804
'And the last number is..'

15:29.846 --> 15:31.013
'...six!'

15:31.055 --> 15:32.807
Yes! Yes! Yes!

15:32.849 --> 15:34.434
'I won! I did it! I'm rich.'

15:34.475 --> 15:35.852
Oh, Michelle!

15:35.894 --> 15:37.978
I think I'll buy a ranch,

15:35.894 --> 15:37.978
a big ranch

15:38.020 --> 15:40.147
and I'll get you that pony

15:38.020 --> 15:40.147
you always wanted.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.275
Ah, forget the pony.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.275
I'll buy you a horse.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.569
A big horse, a big

15:42.316 --> 15:44.569
10-foot-tall horse

15:44.611 --> 15:45.945
with a golden saddle!

15:45.986 --> 15:47.697
Ha ha ha ha!

15:47.739 --> 15:49.407
'I'm a 50 millionaire.'

15:49.449 --> 15:50.658
- Yes!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.658
- Joey, Joey, Joey, this is--

15:50.700 --> 15:51.868
This is.. It's incredible.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.286
I wanna touch it.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.286
I wanna feel it

15:53.327 --> 15:54.412
I want to smell this puppy.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.830
Hey, I said it was

15:54.454 --> 15:55.830
his lucky day.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.624
- Let me smell the puppy.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.624
- Guys, careful.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.083
- I smelled the puppy first.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.083
- I smelled the puppy second.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.501
'Hey, come on.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.501
You're being a baby.'

16:00.543 --> 16:01.795
Guys, don't rip it.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.795
Don't rip it.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.755
- Will you just let go of it?

16:01.836 --> 16:03.755
- Fine!

16:03.797 --> 16:04.839
'My money!'

16:04.881 --> 16:06.215
My $50 million!

16:06.257 --> 16:08.301
- No!

16:06.257 --> 16:08.301
- No, no, no!

16:08.342 --> 16:09.803
Joey. Joey!

16:09.844 --> 16:12.472
- You'll burn your hand!

16:09.844 --> 16:12.472
- I'll buy a new one!

16:12.513 --> 16:14.557
Joey, Joey, Joey, face it.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.100
It's gone.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.686
Gone?

16:18.728 --> 16:20.062
Yeah.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.314
Now, Joey

16:21.355 --> 16:23.733
you know what they say..

16:23.775 --> 16:25.902
[in unison]

16:23.775 --> 16:25.902
April fools!

16:27.236 --> 16:28.488
What?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.656
Gotcha!

16:30.573 --> 16:32.533
You mean

16:30.573 --> 16:32.533
this was a joke? I..

16:32.575 --> 16:34.285
But I saw it on TV.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.663
No, no, no. See, we taped the

16:34.327 --> 16:36.663
drawing from last week, right?

16:36.704 --> 16:38.205
We went out, we bought

16:36.704 --> 16:38.205
those numbers

16:38.247 --> 16:39.749
and we switched that ticket

16:38.247 --> 16:39.749
with your ticket.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.376
But there's

16:40.750 --> 16:42.376
no tape in there.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.211
Well, sure there is. I put it

16:42.418 --> 16:44.211
in there this morning.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.965
I pressed

16:44.253 --> 16:46.965
the "play" button.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.967
I'm telling you guys,

16:47.006 --> 16:48.967
there's no tape in there.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.761
I took it out this morning

16:49.008 --> 16:51.761
to clean the heads.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.597
We were watching

16:51.803 --> 16:54.597
the real show.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.141
Have mercy.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.141
Joey's ticket actually won!

16:58.142 --> 17:00.269
- The fireplace!

17:00.311 --> 17:02.229
Oh, God. Oh..

17:03.648 --> 17:05.608
Man!

17:05.650 --> 17:08.194
There's nothing

17:05.650 --> 17:08.194
but ashes in there.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.822
Well, gang,

17:08.235 --> 17:10.822
you know what they say..

17:10.864 --> 17:13.157
...April fools!

17:10.864 --> 17:13.157
Ha ha ha ha!

17:13.199 --> 17:14.993
- What?

17:13.199 --> 17:14.993
- Huh?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.161
The tape was in there

17:15.034 --> 17:17.161
the whole time.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.875
Oh, that knucklehead

17:19.163 --> 17:21.875
got us again.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.250
Here's a little hint.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.378
Next time, don't label it

17:23.292 --> 17:25.378
"Joke on Joey."

17:26.587 --> 17:27.881
Oops.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.595
Gang, next time,

17:31.425 --> 17:34.595
don't mess with the king.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.808
Heh heh heh!

17:49.903 --> 17:52.279
[in unison]

17:49.903 --> 17:52.279
April fools!

18:03.917 --> 18:05.251
Hey.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.879
What are you doing up?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.006
I'm just having some tea

18:07.921 --> 18:10.006
and thinking.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.425
Oh, what a coincidence.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.594
I was just thinking

18:12.466 --> 18:14.594
about having some tea.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.597
So, uh..

18:18.681 --> 18:20.767
You okay?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.352
Steve and I had a fight.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.729
Oh.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.817
It just feels like we're not

18:26.856 --> 18:29.817
on the same wavelength anymore.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.153
Is that how it felt when

18:31.151 --> 18:33.153
you and Vicky broke up?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.907
Well, yeah.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.451
Sometimes people

18:37.241 --> 18:38.451
in relationships

18:38.492 --> 18:41.704
just go off

18:38.492 --> 18:41.704
in different directions.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.164
Yeah, I think that's the problem

18:41.746 --> 18:44.164
with me and Steve.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.668
When I was on that mountain

18:47.710 --> 18:49.754
something inside of me

18:47.710 --> 18:49.754
changed.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.633
I just realized that I've been

18:51.171 --> 18:53.633
with Steve so long

18:53.674 --> 18:55.676
that I was forgetting

18:53.674 --> 18:55.676
who I was.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.097
Hmm.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.308
Well, maybe you

18:59.138 --> 19:02.308
have to, you know

19:02.349 --> 19:04.602
talk to Steve and try

19:02.349 --> 19:04.602
to make him understand

19:04.644 --> 19:06.520
how you're feeling.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.607
You're right.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.109
You know, it's nice

19:09.649 --> 19:11.109
having these talks

19:11.150 --> 19:13.444
without being in trouble.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.654
If it'll make you

19:13.486 --> 19:14.654
feel any better

19:14.695 --> 19:17.323
I could ground you

19:14.695 --> 19:17.323
for a couple weeks.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.742
- You're the best.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.742
- Oh, I am, aren't I?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.918
Well, what do you think?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.087
I think that there should

19:28.960 --> 19:31.087
be an elevator there.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.298
Steve, come on,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.298
look around.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.217
Don't you feel

19:35.257 --> 19:37.217
exhilarated?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.928
Don't you feel

19:37.259 --> 19:38.928
overwhelmed?

19:38.970 --> 19:41.388
Don't you feel

19:38.970 --> 19:41.388
anything?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.390
Well, you know,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.390
I feel like a chili dog.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.269
Forget it.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.188
Deej,

19:47.311 --> 19:49.188
I was just kidding.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.231
No, but I'm serious.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.860
What's the problem?

19:54.401 --> 19:56.195
It's us.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.822
You know, it's like

19:56.236 --> 19:57.822
somebody let the air

19:57.864 --> 19:59.157
out of our relationship.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.660
Don't you feel it?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.203
Well..

20:04.244 --> 20:05.746
Well, I'll admit that things

20:04.244 --> 20:05.746
aren't like

20:05.788 --> 20:07.165
they used to be at the beginning

20:07.206 --> 20:09.625
but, but hey, I was willing

20:07.206 --> 20:09.625
never to bring it up.

20:11.169 --> 20:14.881
Not talking about it is not

20:11.169 --> 20:14.881
gonna make it go away.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.383
You know, there's something

20:14.922 --> 20:17.383
missing between us.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.721
I know.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.683
I was thinking

20:23.056 --> 20:25.683
about that in L.A.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.186
We're not connecting

20:25.725 --> 20:28.186
like we used to, you know

20:28.227 --> 20:29.520
but, you know,

20:28.227 --> 20:29.520
we still have fun

20:29.562 --> 20:31.397
we get to hang out,

20:29.562 --> 20:31.397
we talk to each other.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.523
Yeah, but..

20:32.565 --> 20:34.274
...where's the heat?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.402
I mean, where's that passion

20:34.316 --> 20:36.402
that we used to have?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.281
I mean, what you're talking

20:38.779 --> 20:41.281
about is a friendship.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.327
It's not a romance.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.748
So what are you saying,

20:46.662 --> 20:48.748
we should break up?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.168
That's a scary thought.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.128
I know.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.715
It scares me too.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.301
I mean, you're the first guy

20:59.050 --> 21:01.301
that I ever loved.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.182
You know, but..

21:06.224 --> 21:08.935
...climbing this mountain

21:06.224 --> 21:08.935
was really scary

21:08.976 --> 21:11.645
until I actually did it

21:11.687 --> 21:13.856
and then it was incredible.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.364
I understand, Deej.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.283
I mean, you're

21:22.406 --> 21:24.283
my first love too

21:24.324 --> 21:26.202
but we can't

21:24.324 --> 21:26.202
stay together

21:26.244 --> 21:29.038
just 'cause we're

21:26.244 --> 21:29.038
afraid to break up.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.373
Yeah, because if we did

21:31.415 --> 21:34.627
we could both be missing out

21:31.415 --> 21:34.627
on other incredible things.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.130
Yeah, but we'd lose something

21:34.668 --> 21:37.130
incredible too..

21:37.588 --> 21:38.631
...us.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.300
No, we'll never lose us

21:41.341 --> 21:43.510
and we'll always be friends.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.556
I hope so, 'cause..

21:48.766 --> 21:50.977
...you're the best friend

21:48.766 --> 21:50.977
I ever had.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.954
Did we just break up?

22:11.455 --> 22:13.540
Yeah, I think so.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.836
What's next?

22:18.171 --> 22:19.630
I guess we should, um..

22:19.672 --> 22:23.467
...we should just head down

22:19.672 --> 22:23.467
and face the world.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.306
But, uh...

22:28.346 --> 22:30.348
Is it okay if we, uh,

22:28.346 --> 22:30.348
take the trail this time?

22:31.309 --> 22:32.643
Sure.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.485
'Deej, are you coming?'

22:41.527 --> 22:43.570
Go ahead.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.570
I'll catch up.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.198
Are you sure?

22:45.239 --> 22:47.825
Yeah. I just need a minute.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.785
I'll be okay.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.669
I'll be okay.
