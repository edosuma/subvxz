00:32.000 --> 00:33.200
OH, DR. TAYLOR.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.100
ALAN, AMY, I WANT YOU
TO MEET CHARLIE MARKMAN.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.200
HE'LL BE TAKING OVER
YOUR CHILD'S CASE.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.800
OK.
WHY AREN'T YOU--

00:40.800 --> 00:43.300
DR. MARKMAN IS A NEONATAL
PULMONARY SPECIALIST.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.033
HE HAS FAR MORE EXPERIENCE
THAN I DO, AND--

00:46.033 --> 00:47.934
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
OUR DOCTOR ANYMORE?

00:47.934 --> 00:51.734
Dr. Taylor: AMY, THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING MORE I CAN DO.

00:51.734 --> 00:53.667
I PROMISE YOU,

00:53.667 --> 00:55.200
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.600
IS OUR BABY
GOING TO DIE?

01:00.600 --> 01:01.467
NO.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.500
I DON'T KNOW.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.867
Y-YOU DON'T KNOW?

01:07.867 --> 01:10.233
HE HAS
A RESPIRATORY INFECTION

01:10.233 --> 01:12.700
BECAUSE THE EARLY LOSS
OF AMNIOTIC FLUID

01:12.700 --> 01:15.867
COMPROMISED
HIS STERILE ENVIRONMENT.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.033
SO WHEN CAN WE
TAKE HIM HOME?

01:18.033 --> 01:21.667
WE'RE GOING TO ADMINISTER
A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS

01:21.667 --> 01:23.100
FOR THE NEXT 10 DAYS.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.200
AND THEN
WE CAN TAKE HIM HOME?

01:25.200 --> 01:28.600
AND THEN WE'LL SEE
WHERE WE ARE.

01:30.734 --> 01:33.000
YOU KNOW, I THINK
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.100
I HOPE SO.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU HOPE SO?

01:36.200 --> 01:38.700
YOU THINK SOMETHING
BAD'S GONNA HAPPEN?

01:38.700 --> 01:41.700
SOMETHING BAD
HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.600
I KNOW. I JUST--I WANT YOU
TO MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.100
HOW DO I DO THAT?

01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
JUST...
BE HERE WITH ME.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.200
I'M SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.100
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T
FEEL LIKE YOU ARE.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.667
NO, I WANT US TO BE
CORY AND TOPANGA AGAIN,

01:56.667 --> 01:59.867
BECAUSE THEN
EVERYTHING IS OK.

01:59.867 --> 02:01.033
HERE.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.600
HOW DOES HOLDING YOUR HAND
MAKE EVERYTHING OK?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.800
I JUST WANT US TO BE
THE WAY WE USED TO BE.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.600
VALENTINE'S DAY USED
TO BE SUCH A BIG DEAL
TO YOU.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.834
WHAT'S VALENTINE'S DAY
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

02:10.834 --> 02:12.600
AND I WAS THE ONE WHO
DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD HANDS,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.300
BUT--BUT YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO SAID

02:14.300 --> 02:16.600
THAT HOLDING HANDS
IS LIKE TOUCHING SOULS.

02:17.834 --> 02:19.900
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

02:19.900 --> 02:22.500
I SAID THAT YEARS AGO
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.000
I REMEMBER
EVERYTHING YOU SAID

02:24.000 --> 02:26.400
BECAUSE IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO ME.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.700
WHY DON'T YOU SAY STUFF
LIKE THAT ANYMORE?

02:28.700 --> 02:30.700
CORY, LOOK AROUND YOU.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.967
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
WHERE YOU ARE?

02:32.967 --> 02:34.800
TAKE MY HAND.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.233
WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.
THIS IS REAL.

02:37.233 --> 02:38.867
THE REALITY IS
THAT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

02:38.867 --> 02:40.400
IS BACK THERE
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.400
NO. REALITY
IS THIS HAND.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.000
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU USE US

02:45.000 --> 02:47.300
TO HIDE FROM
THE REST OF LIFE, CORY.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.934
I DON'T LIKE IT
THAT YOU'RE NOT
TOPANGA ANYMORE.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.834
WHAT?

02:53.834 --> 02:55.400
TOMMY DRIBBLES
DOWN THE BACKCOURT.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.834
HE FAKES LEFT.
LEFT. TOMMY, LEFT!

02:58.834 --> 02:59.667
IT IS LEFT.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.233
OH, RIGHT, SORRY. OK.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.567
HE FAKES LEFT.
HE SHOOTS!

03:02.567 --> 03:03.767
HE SCORES!

03:03.767 --> 03:06.100
THEY WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP!

03:06.100 --> 03:08.200
THEY WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP!

03:08.200 --> 03:09.600
AND AS A REWARD,

03:09.600 --> 03:11.000
TOMMY GETS TO CARRY
ERIC'S SUITCASE

03:11.000 --> 03:14.500
DOWN TO THE CAR!

03:14.500 --> 03:16.000
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.033
OHHH.

03:17.033 --> 03:20.967
WHY DON'T YOU GET
BIG GIRL TO CARRY IT?

03:20.967 --> 03:23.767
'CAUSE BIG GIRL
IS WITH THE RAT, TOMMY.

03:23.767 --> 03:26.767
IS THAT
WHY YOU'RE SO SAD?

03:26.767 --> 03:29.000
NO. I'M NOT SAD,
ACTUALLY. THAT'S--

03:29.000 --> 03:31.200
IT'S THE FARTHEST
THING FROM MY MIND.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.500
WELL, SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING YOU.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.900
YOU'RE ACTING
DIFFERENT.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.867
YEAH? HOW DO I
NORMALLY ACT?

03:36.867 --> 03:38.734
BLLLBBBLLLBB!

03:41.133 --> 03:43.500
HI, BIG GIRL.
HI, RAT.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.400
HEY, TOMMY.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.834
ERIC, LOOK, MAN,
WE TOLD YOU, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS, OK?

03:48.834 --> 03:50.133
OH, ERIC,
PLEASE DON'T MOVE OUT.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.900
THIS ISN'T WHAT
WE WANTED TO HAPPEN.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.300
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO, GUYS.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.600
NO, NO, NO.
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

03:54.600 --> 03:56.233
IS NOT EVEN THINK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

03:56.233 --> 03:57.500
ERIC, YOU SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE HERE.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.834
YOU SHOULD BE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.200
PANCAKES?!

04:00.200 --> 04:01.500
WHAT?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.400
THE INTERNATIONAL
HOSPITAPANCAKES?

04:03.400 --> 04:05.567
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY THERE,
RACHE? HMM?

04:05.567 --> 04:08.400
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.867
OH, NOTHING. HA HA!

04:10.867 --> 04:13.400
I DON'T WANT TOMMY TO
KNOW ABOUT THE HOSPITAL.

04:16.934 --> 04:19.567
WHO'S IN
THE HOSPITAL?

04:19.567 --> 04:22.100
SEE WHAT
YOU JUST DID? HUH?

04:22.100 --> 04:25.734
LOOK, I MEAN, I DON'T
WANT THE KID TO KNOW
ABOUT THE BABY, ALL RIGHT?

04:25.734 --> 04:27.500
KID'S GOT NO FAMILY.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.867
HE COMES OVER HERE
ONCE A WEEK

04:28.867 --> 04:30.467
TO HANG OUT WITH
HIS BIG BROTHER ERIC.

04:30.467 --> 04:32.500
THE KID DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THIS.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.767
THE KID
WANTS TO KNOW

04:33.767 --> 04:36.967
WHO'S IN THE
HOSPITAL, ERIC.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.400
ALL RIGHT, LITTLE MAN.
COME HERE.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.000
OK, TOMMY, UM, SEE,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.600
I'VE GOT THIS NEW
LITTLE BROTHER.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.867
BUT, YOU KNOW, DON'T WORRY.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.367
'CAUSE YOU'RE STILL
MY LITTLE BROTHER, TOO.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.300
BUT, UM, SEE,
THIS NEW LITTLE GUY,

04:49.300 --> 04:52.133
HE'S, UH,
HE'S PRETTY SICK.

04:52.133 --> 04:53.600
CAN WE
GO SEE HIM?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.900
YOU WANT
TO GO SEE HIM?

04:55.900 --> 04:57.900
IF HE'S
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER,

04:57.900 --> 05:00.233
THEN ISN'T HE MY
LITTLE BROTHER, TOO?

05:11.100 --> 05:14.100
HI. HOW'S THE BABY?

05:14.100 --> 05:16.000
NO CHANGE.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.300
I'M REALLY SCARED,
ANGELA.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.800
I FEEL SO BAD
FOR EVERYBODY.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.600
HOW'S CORY
HANDLING IT?

05:24.600 --> 05:25.967
HE'S NOT.

05:25.967 --> 05:27.600
HE'S NOT EVEN
DEALING WITH IT.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.700
ALL HE CAN TALK ABOUT
IS HOLDING HANDS

05:29.700 --> 05:31.567
AND MAKING EVERYTHING
GO AWAY.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.033
LIKE JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE TOGETHER

05:33.033 --> 05:35.400
WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY
PROTECTED FROM LIFE.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.734
WHAT IS THAT? WE'RE NOT
KIDS ANYMORE, ANGELA.

05:38.734 --> 05:39.867
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

05:39.867 --> 05:41.600
YOU'RE HANDLING IT
VERY MATURELY.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.800
THANK YOU.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.867
IT'S NOT
A COMPLIMENT.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.867
ANGELA.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.700
I'M NOT 12 ANYMORE.

05:51.700 --> 05:56.000
AND WHEN I WAS, I WAS
LIKE THE STRANGEST KID
IN THE UNIVERSE.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.133
OH, WELL, YOU STILL
GOT SOME STRANGE IN YOU.

06:00.133 --> 06:03.100
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
THIS ONE TIME,

06:03.100 --> 06:06.900
I WAS TRYING TO HELP
CORY WITH THIS POEM
WE HAD FOR SCHOOL,

06:06.900 --> 06:10.300
NOT JUST THE WORDS OF IT,
BUT THE ESSENCE BEHIND IT.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.667
I WENT OVER TO HIS HOUSE.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.133
HE READ THE POEM,

06:14.133 --> 06:19.734
AND I DANCED...
ALL AROUND HIS KITCHEN.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.500
AND I PUT LIPSTICK
ALL OVER MY FACE.

06:24.500 --> 06:28.033
AND WHY DO WE REMEMBER
THAT STORY SO WELL?

06:28.033 --> 06:33.300
'CAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT WAS THE MOMENT
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH ME.

06:35.767 --> 06:39.000
BOY, YOU KNOW, HE ALWAYS
USED TO BE THE ONE

06:39.000 --> 06:40.734
BRINGING ME
BACK TO REALITY.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.567
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

06:43.567 --> 06:45.567
OH, HONEY, YOU DID.

06:45.567 --> 06:49.700
YOU'RE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE
IN HIS LIFE, TOPANGA.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.233
HE NEEDS YOU
TO TAKE HIS HAND,

06:52.233 --> 06:53.600
DANCE AROUND HIM,

06:53.600 --> 06:57.767
HELP HIM THROUGH
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

06:57.767 --> 07:00.934
BABY, WITHOUT YOU,
ALL HE HAS IS REALITY.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.767
OH, BOY.

07:08.767 --> 07:11.100
DO I NOT
CHERISH TOPANGA?

07:11.100 --> 07:13.934
OH, HERE WE GO
INTO CORYLAND.

07:16.734 --> 07:20.000
DID I NOT RAISE HER
AND BRING HER INTO MY HOME?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.600
WHO TALKS LIKE YOU?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.400
YOU KNOW, I GO TO YOU,
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GETTING.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.600
"HELLO, MR. MATTHEWS."

07:26.600 --> 07:28.367
HERE'S
YOUR SENSIBLE ADVICE.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.500
I'M ON MY WAY.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.400
YOU ARE MY SENSIBLE,
GO-TO GUY.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.800
OK, BUT SHE IS...

07:34.800 --> 07:37.600
NOT WHAT SHE USED TO BE.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.767
WHAT DID SHE USED
TO BE, MR. MATTHEWS?

07:39.767 --> 07:41.867
NOT SENSIBLE.
SHE WAS TOPANGA.

07:41.867 --> 07:47.700
NOW SHE'S PHYLLIS MUNSON
FROM PISCATAWAY, NEW JERSEY.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.867
TOPANGA LAWRENCE
IS ONE OF THE BEST
PEOPLE I KNOW.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.734
I KNOW. SO WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO HER?

07:53.734 --> 07:55.500
YOU'VE KNOWN HER
AS LONG AS I HAVE.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.800
SHE'S GROWING UP, CORY.
SO ARE YOU.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.200
WHY DOES SHE
HAVE TO GROW NOW?

08:00.200 --> 08:02.800
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

08:04.667 --> 08:06.934
DO YOU WANT TO GO SEE
HOW YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
IS DOING?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.367
YEAH.

08:10.367 --> 08:11.734
WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

08:12.900 --> 08:14.100
YEAH.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.767
MY HOMEWORK'S GOING
TO BE UNBELIEVABLY
LATE THIS WEEK.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.200
YEAH, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.567
HEY, KAREN, PAUL.

08:30.567 --> 08:33.200
HOW'S SHE DOING TODAY?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.600
SHE'S A LITTLE
BETTER TODAY.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.133
SHE HAS
MUCH BETTER COLOR,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:37.133 --> 08:39.100
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
SHE LOOKS GREAT.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.800
YEAH, SHE DOES.
SHE LOOKS GREAT.

08:47.367 --> 08:49.033
MICHAEL.

08:50.967 --> 08:52.567
HOW'S YOUR SON?

08:52.567 --> 08:55.000
I THINK
HE SMILED AT ME.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.767
HEY.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.200
SAY ONE FOR
MY BOY, WILL YOU?

09:02.200 --> 09:04.000
OH, THESE
ARE FOR ALL OF US.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.300
COME ON, KID.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.967
LET'S GET BETTER
AND OUT OF HERE.

09:19.967 --> 09:22.100
WE'VE GOT A MUCH
BETTER PLACE
FOR YOU AT HOME.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.033
COME ON, KID.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.200
JOSHUA.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.767
WHAT?

09:29.767 --> 09:32.000
I DECIDED ON JOSHUA.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.667
THEN JOSHUA
IS HIS NAME.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.200
JOSHUA GABRIEL MATTHEWS.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.867
GABRIEL MEANS
"HE WHO GOD PROTECTS."

09:43.867 --> 09:46.600
WELL, HOW'S JOSHUA
DOING TODAY?

09:49.200 --> 09:52.800
THE DOCTOR SAYS
WE SHOULD TALK TO HIM.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.600
HE SAID WE SHOULD TELL HIM
WHO WE ARE.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.400
HEY, JOSHUA.

10:10.233 --> 10:11.900
I'M YOUR FATHER.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.467
AND I LOVE YOU.

10:13.467 --> 10:17.000
AND I WANT YOU
TO GET BETTER
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.667
COME ON...

10:18.667 --> 10:20.200
JOSHUA...

10:21.567 --> 10:22.800
GABRIEL.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.734
COME ON, GOD.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.200
SEE, BUDDY,
HE'S STILL HERE.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.400
OK. TIME TO TAKE YOU
BACK NOW, TOMMY.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.834
ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK
AFTER YOU DROP ME OFF?

10:42.834 --> 10:44.133
YEP, I'M GOING TO COME
RIGHT BACK HERE,

10:44.133 --> 10:45.567
AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM
ALL ABOUT YOU.

10:45.567 --> 10:46.767
I'M GONNA TELL HIM

10:46.767 --> 10:48.233
HOW YOU SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY WITH HIM.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.834
HE KNOWS I DID.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.000

11:13.000 --> 11:16.800
CORY, I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE REALLY DISTANT.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.033
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

11:22.033 --> 11:23.667
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

11:23.667 --> 11:25.967
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.734
WHY NOT?

11:27.734 --> 11:29.467
BECAUSE WE CAN'T
GO THROUGH LIFE TOGETHER

11:29.467 --> 11:32.600
IF YOU EXPECT ME
TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE
WHAT'S REAL FOR YOU.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.600
WELL, YOU USED
TO BE ABLE TO.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.300
WE WERE KIDS!
NOTHING BAD EVER HAPPENED!

11:38.300 --> 11:39.500
THE WORST THING
THAT HAPPENED

11:39.500 --> 11:41.233
WAS THAT YOUR POP-TART
FELL ON THE GROUND.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.300
MM-HMM.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.934
AND YOU HELD IT UP
TO THE SKY,

11:43.934 --> 11:47.367
AND YOU SAID,
"GOD MADE DIRT.
DIRT WON'T HURT." RIGHT?

11:47.367 --> 11:48.767
BUT IT WAS STILL DIRTY.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.600
YEAH, BUT I ATE IT ANYWAY.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.233
I DIDN'T HAVE TO, BUT I DID
BECAUSE YOU SAID TO.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.900
NOW, I WANT YOU TO MAKE
EVERYTHING BETTER, TOPANGA.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.500
WE CAN'T HAVE
THAT RELATIONSHIP ANYMORE.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.934
WHY?
I'M NOT LIKE THAT
ANYMORE.

11:58.934 --> 12:00.066
WHY NOT?

12:00.066 --> 12:02.567
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.300
CORY, THIS IS BAD.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.133
THERE ISN'T ANYONE
WHO CAN MAKE IT BETTER.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
CORY!

12:12.400 --> 12:14.100
SHAWNY!

12:14.100 --> 12:15.400

OHHH!

12:17.700 --> 12:19.767
LOOK, EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.767
YOU THINK?

12:21.767 --> 12:23.400
I KNOW.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.734
I TRIED TO REACH YOU GUYS
AT THE DORM, MAN.

12:32.734 --> 12:34.000
ANGELA TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I DROVE BACK
AS FAST AS I COULD.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.500
HI, MR. FEENY.

HOW'S THE BABY?

12:41.967 --> 12:44.400
IT'S REALLY SERIOUS,
SHAWN.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.900
NO, HE'S GOING
TO BE FINE.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.367
HE'S SO SMALL.
HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME
BREATHING,

12:49.367 --> 12:51.100
AND HE CAN'T FIGHT
THE INFECTION.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.500
HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.367
WILL YOU PLEASE
TALK TO HIM?

12:56.367 --> 12:57.900
I CAN'T GET THROUGH
TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.867
YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

12:59.867 --> 13:02.100
OK, LET ME
HANDLE THIS.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.367
MAN, ARE WE
GOING TO HAVE FUN
WITH THIS KID.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.600
THE KID'S GOING
TO BE OUR SLAVE.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.734
I'M GOING TO TEACH HIM
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

13:08.734 --> 13:12.000
THEN I'LL BAIL HIM
OUT OF JAIL.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.200
MR. FEENY, WILL YOU
SAY SOMETHING TO THEM?

13:14.200 --> 13:16.100
HEY, MR. FEENY, I THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

13:16.100 --> 13:17.367
ANOTHER MATTHEWS
TO TEACH.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.600
MAYBE HE'LL
HAVE A KID LIKE ME
TO SIT NEXT TO.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.900
HE WON'T HAVE TO.
WHY NOT?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.400
YOU'LL
STILL BE THERE.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.800
WAAH! OUCH!

13:23.800 --> 13:25.667
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SAY ANYTHING TO THEM?

13:25.667 --> 13:26.600
YES. YES, I AM.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.300

YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.200

I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.967
HEY, SHAWN.

HEY, MR. MATTHEWS.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.567
HI, SWEETIE.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.867

13:39.867 --> 13:45.033

SITTING WITH HIM
AND TALKING TO HIM,

13:59.367 --> 14:00.967
AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT,

14:00.967 --> 14:03.500
IT'S UP TO JOSH.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.100

IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
IF YOU WENT IN

14:06.100 --> 14:07.500

TO YOUR BROTHER, TOO.
