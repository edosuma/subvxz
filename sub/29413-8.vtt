WEBVTT

00:10.445 --> 00:11.881
MALCOLM:
Hey, Pop.

00:11.924 --> 00:12.838
How was bowling?

00:12.882 --> 00:14.492
Terrible.

00:14.536 --> 00:18.192
I threw the game-winning strike.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.454
Why is that bad?

00:19.497 --> 00:21.151
Because my partner Ernie
sprained his wrist

00:21.195 --> 00:23.719
giving me a high five.

00:23.762 --> 00:27.027
What kind of clown celebrates
with his rolling hand?

00:28.463 --> 00:31.118
Yeah, you know,
everybody knows

00:31.161 --> 00:33.903
that it's either finger pistols
or a delicate...

00:33.946 --> 00:36.427
hip bump.

00:36.471 --> 00:40.214
Anyway, it's too late for me
to find another partner,

00:40.257 --> 00:42.607
so I'm gonna have to forfeit
the championship game.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.305
Well, I could be your partner.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.177
Like I said, I'm gonna have to
forfeit the championship game.

00:47.221 --> 00:50.050
Calvin, I'm serious,
I'm pretty solid.

00:50.093 --> 00:52.356
You know, back in high school,
I spent every Saturday night

00:52.400 --> 00:54.750
bowling with my mom and...

00:54.793 --> 00:56.360
and her special friend Rick.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.408
Wait, what you mean,
her boyfriend?

01:00.451 --> 01:02.062
No.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.238
They just hung out
and had sleepovers.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.285
Oh. Okay. Yeah.
Oh. Okay.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.157
Look, man,
I appreciate the offer,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.289
but I'm going up against the
toughest team in the league.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.638
Ah, come on, Pop.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.510
You've lost to them for
four years in a row now.

01:15.553 --> 01:18.513
At least this year if you lose,
you can blame Dave.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.080
Rick always did.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.387
You know what, fine.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.388
Practice starts tomorrow.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.303
Yes.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.262
Time to start warming up
the glutes.

01:33.397 --> 01:35.269
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:35.312 --> 01:36.357
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.406
This is exciting.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.017
It's like I'm at the NBA Finals
with LeBron.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.369
Not 'cause you're black;
'cause you're good.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.459
And I'm with Weird Al.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.896
Not because you're white;
because you're weird.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.421
So you only come
to cheer Calvin on?

01:57.465 --> 01:58.466
You don't bowl with him?

01:58.509 --> 02:00.207
Gemma, there
are two things

02:00.250 --> 02:01.599
that Tina Butler
doesn't do:

02:01.643 --> 02:03.384
wear rented shoes

02:03.427 --> 02:05.473
and stick her fingers in
other people's balls.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.779
No.

02:07.823 --> 02:11.435
And just like that,
I no longer bowl either.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.698
So we're gonna
go get some snacks.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.135
You guys want something?

02:15.178 --> 02:17.180
Ooh, some nachos would be great.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.182
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.444
You haven't earned it yet.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.446
Nachos are for winners.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.927
Ooh, nachos
sound good to me.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.189
Well, that's because you
haven't seen the hands

02:26.233 --> 02:27.364
of the man that
makes the nachos...

02:27.408 --> 02:29.497
Please, Tina,
you already ruined bowling.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.976
Don't take nachos
from me, too.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.502
All right.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.552
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

02:41.596 --> 02:44.207
Dave, I thought you said
you knew how to bowl?

02:44.251 --> 02:46.383
Oh...
you mean like this?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.130
Ha, ha!

02:54.174 --> 02:55.784
Stee-rike!

02:55.827 --> 02:57.351
Well, all right!

02:57.394 --> 02:58.613
You canbowl.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.876
Yeah. Tell that to Rick.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.317
Hey, this isn't
the snack bar.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.666
Gemma, as a
Christian woman,

03:08.710 --> 03:10.451
I cannot let you
eat those nachos.

03:13.541 --> 03:16.108
This is why we're here.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.632
Dance Floor Party?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.808
I used to love this game.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.723
Check out the high scores.

03:23.725 --> 03:26.858
T-Booty, T-Booty,
T-Booty, T-Booty.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.120
Oh, my God!

03:28.164 --> 03:29.861
You're T-Booty.

03:29.905 --> 03:33.387
The "T" stands for Tina, and
the "Booty" speaks for itself.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.651
So you want to play?

03:36.694 --> 03:37.869
Oh, no.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.480
It's been forever.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.961
I don't want to embarrass myself
in front of your famous booty.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.659
Oh, come on. Who cares?

03:44.702 --> 03:47.096
It's just us. There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.445
Okay.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.534
But you might not want
to stand near me.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.580
When I get going, I lose
track of my elbows.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.585
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Time for the dance party!

04:01.545 --> 04:02.546
Come on, girl,
don't be shy.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.765
Throw them 'bows!

04:03.808 --> 04:06.246
Come on.
There you go.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.862
Hey, big brother.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.733
Why do you always come here
to do laundry?

04:15.777 --> 04:17.605
Your building has a washer
and dryer.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.607
What's wrong with
you, Malcolm?

04:19.650 --> 04:21.478
I can't ask Mama to drive
all the way over there

04:21.522 --> 04:22.653
to do my laundry.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.397
Oh, whoa-ho-ho.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.269
Those kicks are fire.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.401
I know, they are
limited editions.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.622
From the ankle down,
I'm fly as hell.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.364
Limited editions?

04:37.407 --> 04:38.887
Aren't you the one always
ragging on people

04:38.930 --> 04:40.497
for blowing their money
on frivolous things?

04:40.541 --> 04:42.282
Oh, man,
that was Broke Malcolm.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.413
You're talking
to Money Malcolm.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.588
Nice to meet you.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.982
It's nice to
meet you, too.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.853
Tell Broke Malcolm I'll
see him again next week.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.900
Look, stop hating.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.424
Now that I'm making some money,
I deserve a few nice things.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.339
Well, yeah, but if you ever
want to move out of here,

04:56.383 --> 04:58.298
you should start
investing your money.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.647
What you mean,
like in stocks?

04:59.690 --> 05:03.303
No, thanks. Money Malcolm
is about stacks.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.652
Are those all singles?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.436
Maybe.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.569
I'm not talking
about stocks, man.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.919
The real money's in
cryptocurrency--
like Bitcoin.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.182
Oh, I don't trust
that Internet money, man.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.097
Seems like a scam.Oh, well,

05:15.140 --> 05:16.577
last week
I tripled my investment.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.969
Well, then you hold this.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.188
I'm-a look for quarters
in the couch.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.767
Boom!

05:32.810 --> 05:35.813
Three in a row!
That deserves a hip bump.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.555
Well, get your skinny ass
over here and get to bumping.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.169
LaTonya,

05:44.213 --> 05:46.041
is that Calvin Butler?

05:46.084 --> 05:48.609
Sure is.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.567
And it looks like he's dancing
with his accountant.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.268
Uh, Calvin,
who are they?

05:56.312 --> 05:57.792
Those are the Pink Ladies.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.620
That's who we're playing
for the championship.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.536
They're the most vicious team
in the league?

06:02.579 --> 06:04.059
Don't let the pink fool you.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.540
If the devil bowled a 210
and wore a girdle,

06:06.583 --> 06:08.759
that's what he'd look like.

06:09.673 --> 06:13.460
210? You better
try 235, sucker.

06:14.678 --> 06:15.940
How did they
even hear that?

06:15.984 --> 06:18.682
What part of the devil
don't you understand?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.861
What happened to
your partner Ernie?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.863
His ex-wife
shoot him again?

06:27.082 --> 06:28.388
Yes.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.696
But he also hurt
his wrist.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.263
Oh.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.744
Well, I'm his new partner
Dave Johnson.

06:36.787 --> 06:37.745
Ain't nobody
ask your name.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.447
They already got
their game faces on.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.884
No, they was born with
them stank faces.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.549
Wow, you're still going?

06:59.593 --> 07:02.813
Yeah! I can't believe how easily
this came back to me.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.165
Well, good for you.AUTOMATED VOICE: New high score!

07:07.209 --> 07:09.298
Wait, what?

07:09.341 --> 07:11.735
Look at that--
I just beat your high score!

07:11.779 --> 07:13.476
What? Th-That's
not possible.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.869
Oh, yes, it is!

07:14.912 --> 07:16.000
Check it out, T-Booty.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.698
G-Cutie in the house!

07:20.744 --> 07:21.789
All right, Calvin,

07:21.832 --> 07:23.704
show the Pink Ladies
who we are.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.183
I know who you are:

07:25.227 --> 07:27.098
a broke-ass
Crockett and Tubbs.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.973
Face it, you're never
gonna beat us, Calvin.

07:32.016 --> 07:35.019
Or should I say
Wrong Way Butler?
Ooh!

07:36.934 --> 07:37.979
Wrong Way Butler?

07:38.022 --> 07:39.197
What are they
talking about?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.417
Nothing. It's just
some old news.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.897
Like their wigs.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
No, he didn't.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.119
Yes, he did.

07:49.251 --> 07:52.646
Show us what you got,
Wrong Way.
Oh.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.126
BOTH :
Wrong Way! Wrong Way!

07:55.170 --> 07:57.477
Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

07:57.520 --> 07:59.653
Wrong Way! Wrong Way!

07:59.696 --> 08:02.264
Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

08:02.307 --> 08:04.266
Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

08:04.309 --> 08:05.615
Ooh!
Gutter ball!

08:05.659 --> 08:08.313
Calvin,
what just happened?

08:08.357 --> 08:09.880
This is your fault.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.013
You must have tweaked my hip
on our last celebration bump.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.581
Wha...?
That makes no sense.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.670
The entire move
was designed for safety.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.021
Hey, Wrong Way,

08:20.064 --> 08:21.718
instead of bowling,

08:21.762 --> 08:23.807
why don't you
and your math tutor

08:23.851 --> 08:25.417
go work on
some equations.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.551
I got one.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.988
You plus you
plus a bowling ball

08:31.032 --> 08:33.208
equals two chumps
and a bowling ball.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.603
Well, you plus you

08:36.646 --> 08:38.953
equals two
women that...

08:38.996 --> 08:40.563
need to work on
your manners.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.651
Mm-hmm.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.915
And another gutter ball.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.788
That's it.

08:47.831 --> 08:48.789
I'm going home.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.355
What?Practice is over.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.357
Calvin, we can't leave now.

08:52.401 --> 08:55.665
You finally hit them
with an insult I understand.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.759
Hey, Tina.
How was your walk?

09:02.803 --> 09:03.934
It was great.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.762
Just getting
my cardio on.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.895
Wasn't yesterday so fun?

09:07.938 --> 09:10.158
I still can't believe
I beat your high score.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.638
Girl, that was 24 hours ago.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.769
I have two grown sons.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.945
Ain't nobody thinking
about that game.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.861
Ooh, hey, Tina,
can I ask you a question?

09:17.905 --> 09:19.950
I don't know,
she just got lucky!

09:21.343 --> 09:22.866
Are you talking
about the Pink Ladies?

09:22.910 --> 09:26.740
Of course. Like, what else
would I be talking about?

09:26.783 --> 09:28.306
'Cause yesterday
at the bowling alley,

09:28.350 --> 09:30.265
they kept calling Calvin
"Wrong Way Butler."

09:30.308 --> 09:31.701
What's that all about?

09:31.745 --> 09:34.748
Ooh, yeah, that's a touchy story
from high school.

09:34.791 --> 09:37.272
Calvin would kill me
if I told you.Oh, I get it.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.404
It was the night
of the big championship game.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.929
Calvin was the star linebacker.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.931
So, on the last play,

09:43.974 --> 09:46.760
he picked up a fumble, ran it
all the way to the end zone.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.544
That's awesome.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.938
It was the wrong end zone.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.157
Oh...
Oh...

09:54.463 --> 09:56.683
He must have been
so humiliated.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.814
He was.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.381
I mean, everyone
forgot about it,

09:59.424 --> 10:01.731
but those Pink Ladies,
they never let him live it down.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.341
That is terrible.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.126
It's bad enough
to lose the game,

10:05.169 --> 10:07.084
but to have someone
rub it in?

10:07.128 --> 10:10.087
Yeah. Can you imagine?

10:10.131 --> 10:12.437
It was such a long time ago,
though.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.875
Not to him. He still won't
admit that it bothers him.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.441
I don't blame him.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.313
Who wants to hear
about their defeat

10:18.356 --> 10:21.664
over and over
and over again?

10:21.708 --> 10:22.796
I know, right?

10:30.804 --> 10:32.109
Hey, Dave.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.763
Here's the hammer you
wanted to borrow.

10:33.807 --> 10:37.506
Now, you hold it with this end,
and you hit it with this end.

10:39.813 --> 10:40.814
Calvin, wait.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.599
It's two steps, Dave.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.603
All right, look, I lied.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.345
I'm not really building
a Victorian-style birdhouse

10:50.388 --> 10:51.825
with a veranda.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.830
I got you over here...

10:56.873 --> 10:58.875
to show you this.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.139
Where the hell you get that?

11:02.183 --> 11:06.143
Tina told me the story
behind Wrong Way Butler.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.144
She told you that?

11:07.188 --> 11:08.842
Yes, she did.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.714
Including how the other team
voted you MVP.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.761
Well, it's none
of your business.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.806
And I threw that trophy
in the trash can.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.461
Okay, C-Calvin, Calvin.
Calvin, look.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.464
The only way that you are
going to get past this

11:22.507 --> 11:24.901
is by forgiving yourself.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.862
This young man
is hurting.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.603
And the only person
that can heal him

11:31.647 --> 11:32.909
is you.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.999
You do know I'm still
holding a hammer, right?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.568
Calvin, pl-- I-I'm trying
to help you out here.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.483
Please just
give this a shot.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.398
Fine. Look...

11:44.747 --> 11:46.706
I forgive you
for the terrible,

11:46.749 --> 11:48.708
life-changing
mistake you made

11:48.751 --> 11:50.927
when you became friends
with Dave.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.365
Calvin, you cannot win
in the present

11:54.409 --> 11:56.541
if you do not let go
of the past.

11:56.585 --> 12:00.807
Now, tell this kid
that he's a winner.

12:00.850 --> 12:04.941
Tell this kid
that he deserves love.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.944
Tell him that it is not
his fault. Tell him that...

12:07.988 --> 12:09.641
You're not here anymore,
are you?

12:16.474 --> 12:18.259
Hey.
Hey.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.782
Have you looked
at Bitcoin today?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.088
No. Why?

12:21.131 --> 12:22.916
I lost half my money, Marty.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.179
Now I'm about to lose
half my foot up your ass.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.615
Well, hey. O-Okay.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.747
All right.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.400
Calm down. Okay, look.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.881
Cryptocurrency
goes up and down all the time.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.014
Look. Look at the graph.
It's already going back up.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.930
Oh, thank God, man.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.714
Oh, my bad.
My phone was upside down.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.632
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
lose all my money.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.199
No, it's gonna be okay, man.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.504
No, it's not.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.071
I ain't never gonna move
out of here.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.812
I'm gonna die in a twin bed.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.467
Look, this is my fault
for getting you into this.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.947
Let me buy you out.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.122
Really?
Yeah, man.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.558
You're my big brother.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.907
Oh, thank you,
baby bro.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.693
Hold up.
This is half of what I gave you.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.087
Yeah, I'm paying you
current market value.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.832
Oh, cool. Look at that.
It just went down again.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.923
Calvin, are you sure
you're ready for this?

13:13.967 --> 13:15.751
Look, I told you,
the only thing

13:15.795 --> 13:17.971
that's messing me up
is being distracted

13:18.014 --> 13:21.322
by Thing One and
Thing Two over there.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.498
That's why I brought these.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.414
Noise-canceling headphones?

13:26.457 --> 13:27.807
That's right.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.330
Instead of listening
to those hyenas,

13:29.373 --> 13:31.027
I'm gonna have Peaches
on the left

13:31.071 --> 13:32.681
and Herb on the right.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.338
You sure you got those on
the right way, Calvin?

13:37.381 --> 13:39.253
No, no, he got
'em on backwards,

13:39.296 --> 13:41.342
like the way he runs.

13:43.953 --> 13:46.086
Well, the joke
is on you.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.391
They're stereo
headphones,

13:47.435 --> 13:49.741
so the audio quality
is exactly the same

13:49.785 --> 13:51.874
no matter which way
you wear them.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.050
Ain't nobody talking
to you, Khaki Pants.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.228
Wrong Way!

13:58.272 --> 14:00.317
BOTH:
Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

14:00.361 --> 14:02.363
Wrong Way! Wrong Way!

14:02.406 --> 14:04.495
I can't hear you,
so I can only assume

14:04.539 --> 14:07.281
you're saying something stupid.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.984
One pin!

14:15.028 --> 14:17.378
He must have been
practicing.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.468
You know, you two
are meaner than Rick

14:20.511 --> 14:21.861
after Mom started having
sleepovers with Doug.

15:04.425 --> 15:09.473

it's the thrill of the fight ♪

15:09.517 --> 15:13.347

15:45.379 --> 15:47.729
I'm so glad
you wanted to play again.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.818
I got the feeling you
were kind of upset

15:49.861 --> 15:51.211
about me having
the high score.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.821
Oh, I'm not upset.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.128
Because you don't
have it anymore.

15:59.262 --> 16:02.744
You snuck back here without me
just to beat my high score?

16:02.787 --> 16:04.789
I didn't sneak back.
I just so happened to be here

16:04.833 --> 16:07.096
at 10:00 a.m. with a pocket
full of quarters and a...

16:07.140 --> 16:09.229
body full of talent.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.016
Okay. So it's like that?

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
Guess it is.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.324
Oh. Then maybe
we should take this

16:17.367 --> 16:18.455
to the next level.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.546
You talking head-to-head?

16:22.590 --> 16:25.245
I'm talking foot-to-foot.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.205
Well, you better
get ready,

16:29.249 --> 16:30.902
'cause I'm about
to bring the pain.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.513
Right after I go
to the bathroom.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.254
I had a large iced tea.Oh.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.436
Oh, man.

16:42.479 --> 16:45.787
Malcolm, did you get out of
Bitcoin at the right time.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.485
For me!

16:51.488 --> 16:53.316
That is good for you,
little brother.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.102
What, you're not jealous?Oh, not at all.

16:56.145 --> 17:00.715
Because I took my money
and invested it in swag.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.587
Oh. More shoes.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.067
: Yeah.Oh, well, look at that.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.677
Welcome back, Broke Malcolm.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.245
That's very funny.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.856
You see, these bad boys
are all sold out.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.337
So, if you look online,
they're already worth double.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.686
Really? Double?

17:15.730 --> 17:18.428
Why would anybody...
Oh, I like those.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.346
Well, look at that--
they happen to be in your size.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.913
How much?
$300.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.655
$300? The box says $150.
There's no way I'm paying that.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.831
$325.
Malcolm, that's not
gonna work on me.

17:29.874 --> 17:30.875
$350.
Sold!

17:35.489 --> 17:37.447
Last ball, Wrong Way.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.883
You're about to lose.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.842
Look, Calvin,

17:40.885 --> 17:42.974
I have done all I can
to keep us in this,

17:43.018 --> 17:44.367
but we need a strike.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.065
So, if you want
to win this,

17:46.108 --> 17:48.110
you are gonna have
to forgive yourself.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.851
Oh, not this again.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.723
Look, I'm gonna be
younger you.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.029
Talk to me.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.119
Dave, I barely like
talking to you

17:57.163 --> 17:58.990
when you're you.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.908
Older Calvin,
it's time to forgive me.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.695
I was only 16 when I ran
the wrong way in that game.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.566
I'm not doing this
with you, Dave.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.133
Oh, you know what?
Maybe you're right.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.961
Maybe I don't
deserve forgiveness.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.005
What?
Yeah, I mean,

18:14.049 --> 18:16.138
I did let the
whole school down.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.097
That's ridiculous.
Come on.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.360
No, it's not.
I mean, I blew it.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.101
Me-- Wrong Way Butler.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.059
Everyone was counting on me.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.976
That's only because you were
the best player on the team.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.934
Yeah, but...

18:29.978 --> 18:32.154
how could I have done
something so stupid?

18:32.198 --> 18:34.025
I mean, what a boneheaded play.

18:34.069 --> 18:37.551
So what? You still won us
the championship the next year.

18:37.594 --> 18:40.684
And you were voted prom king
as a junior.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.646
I guess I was kind of
big man on campus.

18:45.689 --> 18:46.995
You're damn right you were.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.823
You're damn right you were.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.131
That was Dave saying that.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.655
Whoa.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.657
How do you feel?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.528
I feel pretty good.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.051
I feel great.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.706
I feel like kicking
some Pink Lady ass.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.361
Oh, here he goes.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.233
Uh-oh, I hope someone
knows the Heimlich,

19:07.276 --> 19:09.670
'cause he about to choke.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.977
For your information,
I do know the Heimlich.

19:13.021 --> 19:16.067
I'm also certified
in water safety.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.113
Why are we even
talking to you?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.636
You're not even
his real partner.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.248
Wrong. He is my
real partner.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.206
He's also my friend.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.556
Best friend.
Okay, look.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.820
Slow down a little
bit, Dave, okay?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.432
Wrong Way!

19:32.475 --> 19:34.347
BOTH:
Wrong Way! Wrong Way!

19:34.390 --> 19:36.262
Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

19:36.305 --> 19:39.265
Wrong Way! Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

19:39.308 --> 19:41.919
Wrong Way! Wrong Way!

19:41.963 --> 19:44.139
Wrong Way!
Wrong Way!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.489
Wrong Way!

19:52.713 --> 19:55.106
Calvin, you did it!
We won!

19:55.150 --> 19:57.152
That's right, and
more importantly,

19:57.196 --> 19:59.894
broke-ass Oprah and
Gayle over there lost.

20:01.156 --> 20:04.464
Whatever.
We'll see you two next year.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.206
Not if your cholesterol has
anything to do with it.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.949
It is time for a
celebration dance, baby.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.777
♪ You gotta get it,
you gotta go. ♪

20:15.301 --> 20:16.606
I'm about to
pass it to you.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.955
Come on!Here it is.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.001
Ah, I caught it!

20:20.044 --> 20:21.785
Go, man.
Get it, Dave.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.787
Okay.

20:23.831 --> 20:24.788
Pass it back, man.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.007
It feels too good!

20:26.050 --> 20:27.226
I'm keeping it!

20:37.279 --> 20:39.847
You're looking pretty tired
over there, G-Cutie.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.414
Oh, oh! Are you kidding?

20:41.457 --> 20:43.198
I'm just getting started.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.157
Guys, great news--
we won the tournament.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.637
I got two grown
sons, Dave.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.770
Ain't nobody thinking
about your tournament.

20:49.813 --> 20:52.033
Oh, hold on, Tina.
Don't talk to Dave like that.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.165
Zip it, Calvin!
We're battling here!

20:55.384 --> 20:56.777
Guess we can get
some nachos.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.257
You said they're
for winners.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.259
Hell yeah. Let's go
fill this thing up

21:00.302 --> 21:02.086
with some chips
and cheese.
