WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.804
Tonight, founder of
billion-dollar jewelry

00:03.904 --> 00:06.807
phenomenon Kendra Scott
joins the Tank.

00:06.907 --> 00:09.109
I'm a brand builder.
I want you to dream big,

00:09.209 --> 00:10.511
and I think
I can help you get there.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.746
I only go big or I go home.
O'Leary: Yeah!

00:12.846 --> 00:14.448
Smash the competition!

00:14.548 --> 00:16.250
Ohh!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.785
I built this company
for $50 and a skateboard.

00:18.886 --> 00:22.089
If something goes wrong at
all, you're out of business.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.359
We just need expertise.
We've made so many mistakes.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.262
It's a huge cash-suck.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.363
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.998
- Whoa!
- Oh!

00:31.098 --> 00:33.667
Yes.
Thank you
for this opportunity

00:33.767 --> 00:35.269
to swim with the Sharks.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.879
First in the Tank
is a way to have holiday fun

00:45.979 --> 00:47.881
without the stress and mess.

00:56.123 --> 00:59.159
Hi. My name's Daryl
Braithwaite, a. k. a. "Big D."

00:59.259 --> 01:01.194
I'm from the big "D" of Texas.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.696
That's right-- Dallas.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.364
- Whoo-whoo!
- Alright.

01:04.464 --> 01:07.701
I am seeking $300,000 for 10%
of my company.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.803
Sharks, every Halloween,

01:09.903 --> 01:12.639
millions of people gather
around the table to bond

01:12.739 --> 01:15.075
over the joys
of carving jack-o'-lanterns.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.945
but that quickly turns
into tears and frustration.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.013
Why?
Because the most dreaded part

01:20.113 --> 01:24.151
of the pumpkin-carving
experience is...

01:28.155 --> 01:29.523
Oh, my goodness.

01:31.124 --> 01:34.428
...the sticky, slimy,
cold, wet mess!

01:34.528 --> 01:35.829
You end up feeling like this.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.464
Until now, Sharks.

01:37.564 --> 01:40.801
Let me introduce you
to the game-changing solution--

01:40.901 --> 01:45.038
the Pumpkin Glove Scraper!

01:45.138 --> 01:48.942
Our super-long glove goes
all the way up past the elbow,

01:49.042 --> 01:50.811
even on Big D's arms,

01:50.911 --> 01:53.180
to eliminate you having
to experience

01:53.280 --> 01:57.951
that sticky, slimy, cold,
wet mess that everyone hates.

01:59.419 --> 02:03.590
And our powerful serrated
scraper attached to the fingers

02:03.690 --> 02:05.258
allows you
to thoroughly scoop out

02:05.359 --> 02:08.695
every last string of that
disgusting orange guts,

02:08.795 --> 02:11.865
all while keeping your hands
nice and clean--

02:11.965 --> 02:13.667
and your arm also.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.035
Sharks...

02:17.170 --> 02:18.639
...with two kid-friendly--

02:18.739 --> 02:20.207
Sharks...

02:20.307 --> 02:21.708
"With two kid-friendly."

02:21.808 --> 02:23.343
Sharks...

02:23.443 --> 02:25.012
Oh, garbage.
I apologize here.

02:25.112 --> 02:25.946
That's okay.
You can start--

02:26.046 --> 02:27.114
Whew!
Don't fall.

02:27.214 --> 02:30.450
I'm not starting over!
We're doing this!

02:30.550 --> 02:33.787
Um, with sizes
for kids and adults,

02:33.887 --> 02:36.790
each kit comes
with an additional latex glove,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.792
two kid-friendly knives--

02:38.892 --> 02:41.361
so when the scraping is done,
you can begin the fun.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.998
Sharks, we believe it's all
about the experience.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.467
It's time to clean out
the mess of pumpkin carving,

02:47.567 --> 02:49.069
smash the competition...

02:49.169 --> 02:50.337
Ohh!

02:50.437 --> 02:53.440
...with the
Pumpkin Glove Scraper!

02:56.543 --> 02:58.011
Now, that's a Texas-sized

02:58.111 --> 02:59.713
presentation right there.
That's right.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.616
O'Leary:
Big D, $300,000 for 10%?
I can smell it.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.951
$3 million scooper scraper.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.553
I only go big or I go home.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.723
Yeah. So you must have
some huge sales.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.558
I've got some fantastic sales.
Well?

03:11.658 --> 03:13.260
We just started,
actually, our business.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.197
We finally just got our
shipment of product the end of 2021,

03:17.297 --> 03:20.600
the last week of September
and the first week of October.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.569
Wow. Just in
the nick of time.
Just in the nick of time.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.338
But the problem is, is we were
hoping to get it a lot sooner.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.642
But from the end of September
to December 31st,

03:28.742 --> 03:33.280
we sold $58,000 in sales,
3,600--

03:33.380 --> 03:34.614
Take a deep breath,
Big D.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.982
Thank you.
Catch your breath.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.484
Big D's so excited and
passionate about this.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.253
I just love it. So--
Okay, so, 58K in 2021.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.689
Okay.
58K in 2021.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.625
2022, this year,
we've done $52,000,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.394
from January till now,

03:47.494 --> 03:49.096
and 6,400 units.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.231
Okay. So there's not much
growth there, is there?

03:51.331 --> 03:52.599
Well, it's 'cause
it's not Halloween yet.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.167
I'm impressed
that you're selling it

03:54.267 --> 03:56.436
not in the Halloween
time period.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.038
So, explain that to me.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.040
We went to our
first trade show in Las Vegas,

04:00.140 --> 04:01.641
and everybody
kept coming up--

04:01.742 --> 04:03.243
"You guys are the hit
of the show."

04:03.343 --> 04:05.345
A big buying group
came over to us and said,

04:05.445 --> 04:07.080
"Will you come in two weeks
to D. C.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.682
to our big buyer presentation?

04:08.782 --> 04:11.785
We'll guarantee you to be
in front of 60 stores to
pitch."

04:11.885 --> 04:13.887
And I sold over 90%
of all those stores.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.021
They're like, "Daryl,
this is amazing.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.389
You're incredible.
You're a genius."

04:16.490 --> 04:19.159
Nobody who is a genius dumps
that stuff on their head.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.929
Hey, you never know what
you're getting with Big D.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.064
Amen to that.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.599
That's why
you have sales now

04:25.699 --> 04:27.334
for this fall's season. Correct.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.669
So, what does
one kit cost?

04:29.770 --> 04:32.806
One kit costs, if you buy it
in the retail stores, $9.99.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.408
Online, we sell
from $12.99 to $15.99.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.676
And what did it
cost you to make?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.613
The adult/kid combo
cost me $1.78.
Wow.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.581
How did you come up
with this idea?

04:41.681 --> 04:42.716
This is my family.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.718
We love Halloween moments
and traditions.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.820
We love going
to the pumpkin patch.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.722
Every single year, the kids go

04:48.822 --> 04:50.924
and they get the biggest
pumpkin possible,

04:51.024 --> 04:52.292
put it in the cart, boom.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.761
We get home,
and they're all happy, excited.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.197
Dad starts cutting off
the top of the pumpkin.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.331
Then they start going in.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.066
Then all the kids
are like, "Ew, gross!"

05:00.167 --> 05:02.335
My kids are running
around the house...

05:02.435 --> 05:04.738
Yeah, you're doing
it yourself.
...like crazy,
touching all the stuff.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.140
My wife's freaking out.
The kids are crying.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.909
This picture right here, okay?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.177
This is my son, Parker.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.046
This picture right here
is the absolute moment

05:13.146 --> 05:14.481
that I had my "aha" moment.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.951
It hit me like, "Oh, my gosh.
That's it."

05:18.051 --> 05:19.920
Now, is this
your full-time job?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.656
It's not. So, my background
is in medical sales.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.624
I've been bootstrapping
and working hard at night

05:24.724 --> 05:26.159
and weekends.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.327
But with medical sales,

05:27.427 --> 05:29.129
I understood really quickly
that I needed,

05:29.229 --> 05:31.565
when I got married,
to have a job to really help--

05:33.066 --> 05:35.302
that helps pay the bills,
right? That helps pay the bills.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.204
O'Leary: You're asking
for a $3 million valuation.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.540
How do I get my 300,000
pumpkin seeds back?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.843
There is nothing on the market
that competes with this.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.011
I have a patent
that was issued June 15th.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.647
I actually filed it
on Halloween day in 2017.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.316
You did?
On Halloween day.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.484
I've got two more
utility patents pending.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.286
My patent is a broad patent.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.222
One of my partners
is a patent attorney,

05:55.322 --> 05:56.456
so he's helped me button
up all the edges.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.457
Oh,
you have partners?

05:57.557 --> 05:58.758
Yes, I have partners.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.093
How many dollars have you
raised towards this?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.194
And how much
have you spent?

06:01.294 --> 06:03.230
We have put about $850,000
into this.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.200
Yeah. $850,000.
$850,000?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.835
Yep.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.146
All Sharks are still in,

06:20.247 --> 06:22.749
but they are shocked
by the huge amount of money

06:22.849 --> 06:23.950
Big D has invested

06:24.084 --> 06:25.752
in his
pumpkin-carving accessory,

06:25.852 --> 06:27.654
Pumpkin Glove Scraper.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.890
We have put about $850,000
into this.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.493
Yeah. $850,000.
$850,000?

06:33.593 --> 06:34.527
Well, let me tell you why.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.663
I've only put in
about $20,000.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.698
I have a partner that's funded
the rest of the money.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.634
How much of the company
do you own?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.902
I own 70%.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.637
So, my second partner--
he's the financial backing.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.572
He's like, "Daryl, I believe
in you. Let's go."

06:45.672 --> 06:47.507
Well, we first started out
building our machine,

06:47.607 --> 06:50.143
so I've got a machine
that I built to make this.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.179
I can make 6,500 of them a day
over in China.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.749
The problem is, COVID hit,

06:55.849 --> 06:57.384
and they--
they made it so that,

06:57.484 --> 06:58.685
"Hey, the only way
we'll do this

06:58.785 --> 07:00.820
is if you'll order
300,000 gloves."

07:03.690 --> 07:05.292
That sounds like
a horror movie right there.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.459
Yeah.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.428
So, your thing
to your guy was,

07:08.528 --> 07:10.096
"Look, big money guy,

07:10.196 --> 07:11.631
I'm gonna sell through
these quickly,

07:11.731 --> 07:13.466
and the minute
I sell through them,

07:13.566 --> 07:14.935
I'll give you
your money back"?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.903
Correct.
He put in another $300,000.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.338
I'm gonna pay him back
a dollar a unit once

07:18.438 --> 07:19.706
we start becoming profitable
'cause he wants to see--

07:19.806 --> 07:21.374
Kevin!
Whoa!

07:21.474 --> 07:23.743
Wait, wait, Big D,
did I hear a dollar a unit?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.178
He's
speaking your language.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.780
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding!

07:26.880 --> 07:29.215
No, no, Mr. Wonderful.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
O'Leary: Whoa!

07:29.316 --> 07:30.884
Whoa.
Because now I know

07:31.017 --> 07:32.919
how the money guy's
getting his money back.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.587
That's only on that $300,000.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.855
Only if he can sell it.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.524
You know,
often in business,

07:37.624 --> 07:40.627
the challenge is money
can highlight your weaknesses.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.795
Sure.
Right?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.196
And that's what
I call the power of broke.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.632
You can make the same
mistakes with $10,000

07:45.732 --> 07:48.068
as you can
with $800,000, right?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.737
And what puts small businesses
and startups out of business

07:50.837 --> 07:53.873
is actually called over
- funding. They borrow too much.

07:53.974 --> 07:58.511
They buy 300,000 units
when they need 1,000 units.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.246
I think this is
a prime example of that.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.448
I'm out.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.716
Thank you. Appreciate it.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.150
You know, look,
I love this product.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.820
I think it's very, very
innovative, super cool.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.922
Thank you.
I am the Halloween queen.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.992
We have carving contests
at our company, at my house.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.159
I love this.

08:13.259 --> 08:14.127
I think this is
such a great--

08:14.227 --> 08:15.662
I will be a consumer,

08:15.762 --> 08:18.031
but your numbers
just aren't adding up to me.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.967
I think you've taken on way
too much risk too early.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.303
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.738
Yeah, D,
that's your issue, right?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.273
You're gonna learn,
like every startup does,

08:27.374 --> 08:28.508
about their product,

08:28.608 --> 08:29.976
but you're so bought in--

08:30.076 --> 08:31.845
Yep. Yep.
right?--
on inventory.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.147
If something
goes wrong at all,

08:34.247 --> 08:35.682
you're out of business.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.418
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.020
Thank you. Appreciate it.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.654
O'Leary: Big D...
Yes?

08:41.755 --> 08:43.323
...I wish you'd come in here
asking for

08:43.423 --> 08:44.591
a lot less than 300K

08:44.691 --> 08:46.459
because I love the idea.

08:46.559 --> 08:47.894
You know, I could have got
behind it,

08:47.994 --> 08:50.063
but 300K is serious dough.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.698
Yeah.
I love you.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.533
Thank you.
But 300K is too much.

08:53.633 --> 08:54.801
I'm out.
Thank you.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.403
Ohh, big D.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.605
And then there was one.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.006
Whoa.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.809
Listen, I think
this is the best solution

09:02.909 --> 09:04.511
I have ever seen...
Yeah!

09:04.611 --> 09:07.547
...for a Halloween pumpkin
carving product.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.482
Halloween is
my favorite holiday...

09:09.582 --> 09:11.317
Yes!
and, um, I think...

09:11.418 --> 09:12.719
Don't let him down.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.021
...that there are
a lot of positives to this.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.856
Thank you.
But there are
some big negatives.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.692
Okay.
One is, you bought

09:19.793 --> 09:22.762
way too much inventory
before you had sales.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.564
That is something
that can really hang you.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.267
And you don't know
how fast that'll go...

09:27.367 --> 09:30.036
Yeah.
...or if it's gonna take
a long time.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.506
To come in for $300,000
for a 10% ask--

09:33.606 --> 09:35.608
just $300,000 alone, right?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.777
Yeah. Well, that's why I need
your guys' expertise in this.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.880
I cannot imagine
digging out of this hole.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.282
And so, while I love it

09:42.382 --> 09:44.517
and it's great innovation...
But--

09:44.617 --> 09:45.785
...I am so sorry.
I'm just trying to get--

09:45.885 --> 09:47.987
I am out.
Ugh! Lori.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.422
Thank you. Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.623
- Big D.
- Big D!

09:50.723 --> 09:51.825
Good luck, Big D.
We'll see you, Big D.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.327
You're amazing.
Be careful.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.364
I'm sad because I truly
believe with the connections,

09:58.465 --> 09:59.833
the mentorship
from the Sharks,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.801
this thing's ready
to just blow up.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.136
And that's what I was
hoping today.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.038
I didn't get it, but
I'm gonna continue to persevere

10:05.138 --> 10:06.106
like I always have.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.540
When something--
you get knocked down,

10:07.640 --> 10:09.709
you get back up,
and you continue to go.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.946
But I truly believe this was
a fantastic opportunity.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.151
In season 13,
we saw Emily Castro

10:18.251 --> 10:20.520
and Melissa Harrington
make a deal with Lori Greiner

10:20.620 --> 10:22.956
for their seafood
delivery service Fish Fixe.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.924
I want 33.3%.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.126
I don't want you
doing it for that.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.160
I don't care
what you want.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.261
Yeah, I do.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.430
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 25%.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.298
You have a deal!
Boom!

10:32.398 --> 10:34.400
Let's see
what they're up to now.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.102
Last year
when pitched the Sharks,

10:36.202 --> 10:39.038
we had done $820,000
in sales,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.141
but only $20,000 of that
was hitting our bottom line.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.143
We had
a major logistics issue.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.812
We were shipping out of Texas,
and we were getting crushed

10:45.912 --> 10:48.581
on our margins to the
East and West Coast customers.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.383
Before we went
on "Shark Tank,"

10:50.483 --> 10:51.918
we started to
solve that problem,

10:52.018 --> 10:53.553
and we identified
a logistics partner

10:53.653 --> 10:55.054
that would help us
get set up

10:55.155 --> 10:56.322
on the East
and West Coast,

10:56.422 --> 10:58.424
but everything went south.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.626
They had made promises

10:59.726 --> 11:01.261
that they couldn't hold up
on their end.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.663
We had over 400
canceled orders.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.231
It was devastating.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.666
Okay, what are
we gonna do?

11:06.766 --> 11:08.801
Lori and her team
really gave us great advice.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.937
"Stay transparent
with your customers.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.305
Find resolutions."

11:12.405 --> 11:15.275
We spent every waking moment
behind a computer,

11:15.375 --> 11:16.576
doing customer service.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.144
We would just claw back
and say,

11:18.244 --> 11:20.046
"Please, just give us
an opportunity."

11:20.146 --> 11:22.248
And then we had to
establish a new relationship

11:22.348 --> 11:24.884
with another company that
would help us get back on track.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.486
Even with
all of these problems,

11:26.586 --> 11:29.289
we've now hit $1.1 million
in sales

11:29.389 --> 11:31.624
since airing on "Shark Tank"
less than a year ago.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.660
When you're honest
with your customers,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.062
the loyalty grows
even stronger.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.931
Emily and Melissa
are the entrepreneurs

11:38.031 --> 11:40.333
that I dream of because
they don't know the word "no"

11:40.433 --> 11:41.868
and they do whatever it takes.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.637
If they need to talk to me
or anyone or get anything done,

11:44.737 --> 11:46.072
they get it done.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.173
When you're
buying seafood,

11:47.273 --> 11:48.942
you want a company
you can trust.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.710
And that's what
Fish Fixe is.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.111
Our new campaign.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.413
Do you love it?
I love it.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.114
My advice
for a young entrepreneur

11:55.215 --> 11:56.950
is to build a business
that's scalable

11:57.050 --> 11:59.819
by putting the right systems
and people in place.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.988
We are so excited for
where Fish Fixe is today.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.224
We're finally back
in the kitchen making recipes.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.226
We have the support
of an amazing team,

12:06.326 --> 12:09.329
and we're finally able to
spend more time with our families.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.376
Next up is a reinvention

12:23.476 --> 12:26.312
of an everyday workout accessory.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.290
Hi, Sharks. I'm Millie.
And I'm Taylor.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.192
We're best friends living
in New York City,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.628
and we're here
asking for $100,000

12:41.728 --> 12:43.630
for 10% equity
in our company.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.732
Sharks, over the past
few years,

12:45.832 --> 12:48.301
our lives have changed
in so many ways,

12:48.401 --> 12:49.435
from the way we work...

12:49.535 --> 12:50.837
To the way we work out.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.139
Our living rooms
have become our local gyms.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.408
Our bedrooms have turned
into boot camps.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.976
Our mat-based workouts

12:57.076 --> 12:59.379
are no longer just
a yoga class to wind down.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.482
We're doing sculpts, Pilates,
and strength training,

13:02.582 --> 13:04.817
and our yoga mats-- they're
just not supportive enough,

13:04.917 --> 13:07.053
and they add no extra value.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.855
Our exercising
has evolved,

13:08.955 --> 13:10.623
but our yoga mats haven't.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.558
Well, roll over,
yoga mats.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.193
It's time for an upgrade.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.828
Introducing Stakt!

13:15.928 --> 13:18.131
A mat with a unique
foldable design

13:18.231 --> 13:21.868
that unlocks a new level
of versatility for any exercise.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.604
When the Stakt mat
is fully unfolded,

13:24.704 --> 13:26.739
it acts just like
a standard yoga mat,

13:26.839 --> 13:29.142
except it's better
'cause it always lays flat

13:29.242 --> 13:30.443
and it's twice as thick.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.912
If you're in need of some
extra support, we got you.

13:33.012 --> 13:36.416
Fold your Stakt mat
once or twice

13:36.516 --> 13:39.852
and get that much-needed
extra cushion for your joints.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.921
Or fold Stakt up entirely,

13:42.021 --> 13:44.190
and it transforms
into a block

13:44.290 --> 13:47.894
that can be used
for tricep dips,

13:47.994 --> 13:51.397
incline exercises,
such as planks or pushups,

13:51.497 --> 13:55.501
lunges,
and so much more.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.171
Sharks, Stakt was born
out of a love for sweating

13:58.271 --> 14:00.139
and the need for adaptation.

14:00.239 --> 14:03.142
So, which of you wants
to give us stacks of money

14:03.242 --> 14:05.411
and help us take over
the fitness industry

14:05.511 --> 14:07.046
with Stakt?

14:07.146 --> 14:08.348
Good job.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.550
So, you each have a Stakt mat
in front of you.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.151
It also comes with
a carrying strap

14:12.251 --> 14:14.020
so you can easily take it
with you on the go.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.722
Now, I'm in the gym
all the time.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.523
Yeah, right!
Practically every day.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.225
I've seen lots of...
Is that where you keep
your snacks-- the gym?

14:19.325 --> 14:21.794
...foldable mats,
lots of foldable mats.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.529
What is unique about this?

14:23.629 --> 14:26.232
So, when we think about
the foldable mat space,

14:26.332 --> 14:28.634
there's sort of two kind
of mats out that, right?

14:28.735 --> 14:30.203
So, there's the big
gymnastic mats

14:30.303 --> 14:31.804
that are essentially
pieces of cushion

14:31.904 --> 14:33.973
that are held together
by vinyl.

14:34.073 --> 14:37.276
And those mats are heavy.
They're expensive.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.113
They're also not the right
material for yoga or sculpt.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.381
You know,
they're not grippy.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.515
They're not nimble.
You can't take them--

14:42.615 --> 14:44.684
What about the classic
rolled mat,

14:44.784 --> 14:48.121
which you see so many people
carrying, you know, around?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.689
Of course. Yeah. Yeah.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.990
Kind of why
we created this.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.492
So, to give you
some background,

14:52.592 --> 14:55.061
Taylor and I met about
10 years ago in college.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.064
And we've been best friends.
We've been roommates.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.066
And we've always been
into fitness,

15:00.166 --> 15:01.534
but it wasn't really
till the pandemic

15:01.634 --> 15:03.202
when we started working out
a lot more

15:03.302 --> 15:05.471
for our mental health
and our well-being.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.107
And we realized
we were using a yoga mat,

15:08.207 --> 15:11.077
but neither of us
were necessarily doing yoga,

15:11.177 --> 15:12.945
and half the time,
we were rolling up our mats

15:13.045 --> 15:15.415
for extra support
or we were using a block

15:15.515 --> 15:17.850
or something to really enhance
the workouts we were doing.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.952
And so we found that there
was, you know, room in the market

15:20.052 --> 15:22.121
for not only
a more supportive mat,

15:22.221 --> 15:24.023
but also a mat
to add that versatility.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.259
And what's great about this
is it folds,

15:26.359 --> 15:28.961
and it can really act
as a second piece of equipment

15:29.061 --> 15:30.863
and really enhance
and modify the workout.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.833
I'm curious to know the price,
like what it costs you

15:33.933 --> 15:35.201
and then
what you sell it for.

15:35.301 --> 15:39.872
The mat itself in a box
with the strap costs us
$14.90.

15:39.972 --> 15:43.109
It lands to us at $21.50,

15:43.209 --> 15:44.877
and we sell it for $86.

15:44.977 --> 15:45.978
O'Leary: $86.
Yeah.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.046
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

15:47.146 --> 15:50.616
Everything is D-to-C
through our website,

15:50.716 --> 15:52.652
and everything's been
through creating content

15:52.752 --> 15:54.053
and really building
a community.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.355
Let's say it has merit, alright?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.491
It has merit, for sure.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.326
Show us sales.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.395
So in the six and a half
months that we've been selling,

16:02.495 --> 16:05.264
we've done a little
over $110,000 in sales.

16:05.364 --> 16:07.967
That's not bad.
And we haven't put any money
into marketing.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.869
That's better.
So yeah.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.205
I'm signing up for Pilates
now, alright?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.507
And I don't have a mat,
and I go online.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.075
What are the price points
I'm gonna be presented with.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.310
Yes, let me
take you through it.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.413
So the yoga mat industry
is segmented by materials.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.116
This is an EVA foam.
It's non-toxic. It's non
- porous.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.052
We compete
in the premium segment, right?

16:26.152 --> 16:30.590
We're competing with mats that
cost anywhere from $70 to
$130.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.693
We're at $86, right on
the low to mid end of that.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.529
There are mats-- $30, $35--

16:36.629 --> 16:39.098
that are made from
something called PVC.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.533
It's a toxic material,

16:40.633 --> 16:43.603
and it's something we really
haven't been highlighting.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.938
This mat doubles
as a piece of equipment, right?

16:46.038 --> 16:47.139
That's what this was
born out of.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.275
And your visuals are really
good for that, yeah.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.878
Okay, and how much of your own
money is into this business?

16:51.978 --> 16:55.114
We each put in a bit
over $25,000 from our savings.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.251
Okay, what else do you do?
Is your full-time gig?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.553
So right now,
we both have full-time jobs

17:00.653 --> 17:01.854
just to fund the business.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.023
So my background is in sales,
and I've worked at start-ups

17:04.123 --> 17:05.291
for my entire career,

17:05.391 --> 17:06.792
so I really experienced
firsthand--

17:06.893 --> 17:08.461
What kind of start-ups?

17:08.561 --> 17:11.764
All over the place--
restaurants,

17:11.864 --> 17:13.132
dentists, and doctors,

17:13.232 --> 17:16.269
and most recently,
with experiential retail.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.337
Alright, and Taylor?

17:18.437 --> 17:21.974
So my background
professionally, I have worked
in product

17:22.074 --> 17:24.644
for the last six years
on the fintech side.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.945
What kind of product?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.080
It's a portfolio risk
and analytics solution

17:28.180 --> 17:29.715
for fixed-income debt.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.951
You work in
financial services?

17:32.084 --> 17:35.054
I do, in fintech, yeah.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.924
So Millie and Taylor,
I see the viability here,

17:38.024 --> 17:40.393
but I really just don't know
much about this market.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.794
And listen, there could be

17:41.894 --> 17:42.962
a million other kind of mats
out there.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.131
I made my career
over T-shirts.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.532
There's millions
and millions of T-shirts,

17:46.632 --> 17:49.635
but I think there probably
would be more Sharks up here

17:49.735 --> 17:51.470
that would be of
more value to you.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.306
But I wish you luck.
I like it.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.640
But unfortunately,
I don't think I can help you.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.108
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.777
Thank you
for this opportunity.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.046
So I invested in a company
called Bala.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.881
They created
an entire community

18:01.981 --> 18:04.216
around high-end
fitness equipment.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.185
But my concern
is competing with Bala.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.453
I would be working
against myself,

18:07.553 --> 18:09.455
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

18:09.555 --> 18:10.389
Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.757
- Yeah.
- You know, look,

18:11.857 --> 18:14.627
I love yoga.
I think this is a great idea.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.395
I love the idea of
for your knees.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.131
Unfortunately for me,
I have a mat and I've used

18:19.231 --> 18:21.934
the same mat for two years.
I don't see this as a product

18:22.001 --> 18:23.469
that I'm going to
continue to re-buy,

18:23.569 --> 18:26.238
so you're always going to have
to be acquiring new customers.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.474
I really don't see the
longevity of this being something

18:28.574 --> 18:30.109
that would work for me
to be involved.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.511
So for that reason,
I'm out.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.514
Alright,
what are you doing, Lori?

18:35.615 --> 18:36.749
What are you doing,
Kevin?

18:36.849 --> 18:38.951
I don't know.
This is a very difficult deal.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.187
That best part of this deal
are you two.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.054
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.189
But I'm sorry, this is not

18:43.289 --> 18:45.124
a business for me.
I'm out.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.828
Listen,
I like this mat a lot.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.596
I think is the best mat
I've ever seen,

18:50.696 --> 18:52.298
and I've gone through
a lot of them.
Thank you.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.733
This one's fantastic.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.334
Thank you.
I'm going to make you
an offer.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.804
Thank you.
Now, because you guys are
so, so newbie,

18:58.904 --> 19:00.373
I'm going to give you
$100,000,

19:00.473 --> 19:01.874
but I'd like 15%,

19:01.974 --> 19:04.610
but I would like
$1 back per unit sold

19:04.710 --> 19:06.912
until I recoup my $100,000.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.315
Oh.
We will blow this up.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.750
I'm worth it.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.291
We appreciate
your offer.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.493
Well, I guess
while we're here,

19:20.593 --> 19:21.594
be fair to the whole panel,

19:21.694 --> 19:23.095
just want to see
if the conversation--

19:23.195 --> 19:26.365
Listen, guys,
I see a little clock in my head.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.401
It's going, "Tick, tock."

19:28.501 --> 19:30.836
Okay, Lori, do you mind
if Millie and I take a minute?

19:30.936 --> 19:32.238
Take a minute.
Maybe 10 seconds.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.206
Okay.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.849
Okay.

19:43.949 --> 19:44.884
Lori.
Yes.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.886
Thank you
so much for your offer.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.221
Our concern with the royalties
is that it's really gonna

19:49.321 --> 19:51.657
siphon the growth
that we need right now

19:51.757 --> 19:54.260
to kind of hit
with this momentum.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.563
Would you be willing
to do $100,000 for 20%?

19:57.663 --> 19:59.832
Oh. See, the reason
why I did that,

19:59.932 --> 20:01.300
you guys have
a lot of margin.

20:01.400 --> 20:06.605
So really, a dollar, when
you're making like $50 apiece

20:06.706 --> 20:09.475
or more, doesn't really--
it doesn't really hurt.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.944
But if you really want me
in it to win it,

20:12.044 --> 20:13.913
how about 25% equity,

20:14.013 --> 20:16.048
which I'm not going to see
unless we sell this company

20:16.148 --> 20:18.451
or unless we make
a lot of sales.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.754
That's a $400,000
valuation, guys.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.522
Yeah.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.124
Wow.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.229
Would you do...

20:30.329 --> 20:33.499
$150,000 for 22.5%?

20:33.599 --> 20:34.734
- Mm.
- No.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.970
I mean, my plan is to blow out
so many of these,

20:38.070 --> 20:40.339
we won't need it.
Stand your ground, guys.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.341
That's the cheap valuation.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.744
O'Leary:
So, you have to decide.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.345
She's removed the royalty. Yeah.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.814
Now...
You could go back to it.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.183
You know--
And that was at 15%.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.918
That's right.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.855
Okay.
We have another offer here.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.556
Okay.
$100,000.

20:57.656 --> 20:58.924
Yes.
15%.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.460
Yes.
Give you a 35-cent royalty.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.264
75 cents and you got it.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.869
You have a deal.
Whoo!

21:09.969 --> 21:11.670
Alright.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.372
I like it.
Thank you, guys.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.674
- Congrats.
- Thank you guys so much.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.209
Lori's going to be
a great partner.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.210
Can't wait to
work together.

21:18.310 --> 21:19.078
We're gonna blow it up.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.446
Let's do this.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.181
Bye, buys.
Congrats, guys.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.783
Thank you. Congrats.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.854
We're so happy!

21:28.954 --> 21:30.589
This means everything to us.

21:30.689 --> 21:33.926
We are so excited to take
Stakt to the next level.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.828
There is a royalty component
to the deal.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.864
But it's okay.
Lori is so worth it.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.845
Next in the Tank
is an ancient food

21:52.945 --> 21:54.713
with modern health benefits.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.269
<i>Ba, ba, ba, baaa!</i>

22:19.471 --> 22:21.974
Hi, Sharks, how you doing?
My name's Kheedim Oh.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.943
I'm the founder
of Mama O's Premium Kimchi,

22:24.043 --> 22:25.544
based out of New York City.

22:25.644 --> 22:28.447
And to the left of me
is a living legend,

22:28.547 --> 22:30.416
my mom, Mama O.

22:31.884 --> 22:32.985
Hi, Sharks.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.186
Hi.

22:34.286 --> 22:37.223
Along with my beautiful
and very pregnant wife, Amy,

22:37.323 --> 22:38.691
who could not
be here today,

22:38.791 --> 22:41.894
we are the owner/operators
of Mama O's Premium Kimchi.

22:41.994 --> 22:46.131
We are seeking $250,000
for a 10% equity stake.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.701
So Sharks, everyone knows
kimchi is delicious,

22:48.801 --> 22:50.970
but did you also know
it's super nutritious?

22:51.070 --> 22:54.406
Kimchi is an Asian super food
from Korea.

22:54.506 --> 22:58.544
It is naturally fermented
and is full of probiotics.

22:58.644 --> 23:00.346
That's right.
Kimchi is health food,

23:00.446 --> 23:02.681
but more importantly,
it tastes incredible,

23:02.781 --> 23:04.383
and not just
with Korean food either.

23:04.483 --> 23:05.951
Kimchi goes great
with hamburgers,

23:06.051 --> 23:08.921
hot dogs, mac and cheese.
The list goes on.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.957
What makes our kimchi the best
is our authentic

23:12.057 --> 23:13.259
Korean mom recipe...

23:14.827 --> 23:16.195
...kept fresher
than other brands

23:16.295 --> 23:17.763
by our
innovative packaging.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.565
In addition, we invented

23:19.665 --> 23:22.134
the first and most complete
homemade kimchi kit.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.236
What used to take
over three hours,

23:24.336 --> 23:25.905
now you can do
in less than 10 minutes

23:26.005 --> 23:28.073
because all the grinding,
mixing, measuring,

23:28.173 --> 23:31.076
juicing, chopping, and
shopping is already in the jar,

23:31.176 --> 23:32.678
just like my mom
used to make,

23:32.778 --> 23:35.347
and it comes out perfect
every time.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.783
It's a lot easier
than you think.

23:37.883 --> 23:41.787
So, Sharks, who's interested
in fermenting some money

23:41.887 --> 23:45.524
while augmenting your tummy
with Mama O's Premium Kimchi?

23:45.624 --> 23:47.259
Good job.
I love kimchi.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.827
Daymond,
if you wouldn't mind,

23:48.928 --> 23:50.996
as a fellow New Yorker,
would you help Mama O

23:51.096 --> 23:53.132
make some kimchi on stage
using our kit?

23:53.232 --> 23:55.668
Absolutely.
It will be an honor.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.605
<i>Annyeonghaseyo.
Annyeonghaseyo.</i>

23:59.705 --> 24:00.406
Hi, Daymond.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.074
Today, you're going to turn

24:02.174 --> 24:04.743
this Mama O's
Premium Kimchi kit

24:04.843 --> 24:07.079
to Mama O's Premium Kimchi.

24:07.179 --> 24:10.015
It's like sex education,
but spicier.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.919
Please put on
these rubber gloves.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.555
Thank you.
You normally need rubber gloves

24:16.655 --> 24:18.057
during sex education.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.124
Or for kimchi.

24:19.224 --> 24:20.659
You start with a head

24:20.759 --> 24:24.396
of Napa cabbage,
called <i>baechu</i> in Korean.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.031
<i>Baechu.</i>
Alright.

24:26.131 --> 24:29.468
I've already cut one
and brined overnight.

24:29.568 --> 24:32.805
Next, add one jar
of kimchi paste.

24:32.905 --> 24:37.876
Scoop it out with your
fingers, as much as you can
take out.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.378
Okay, that's enough.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.046
That's it? Okay.
That's enough.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.548
Now let's mix.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.483
Just gently toss it.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.686
Gently, tenderly, lovingly.

24:47.786 --> 24:49.655
I'm getting turned on, Daymond.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.091
That's it.
It's ready for fermentation.

24:52.191 --> 24:56.328
It is? Okay.
But some of us enjoy
just-made-fresh kimchi

24:56.428 --> 24:58.664
and eat it like salad.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.566
- Oh!
- Aww, that's sweet.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.334
Grandma.

25:02.434 --> 25:06.071
Now we put it in
the kimchi jar,

25:06.171 --> 25:08.307
and it looks like this.

25:08.407 --> 25:09.975
So what is this
right here?

25:10.075 --> 25:11.377
This is an air lock

25:11.477 --> 25:15.280
that makes your kimchi breathe
while it's fermenting.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.116
You're so amazing.
Thank you.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.151
I feel so
warm and fuzzy now.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.185
Aww.

25:20.285 --> 25:21.453
Daymond, first of all,
thank you.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.822
Sharks, you have a sample
of what we're offering.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.357
We have four
different kimchis,

25:25.457 --> 25:27.860
the kimchi paste,
and the kimchili hot sauce,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.728
which I didn't even mention
in the pitch yet.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.263
I thought it was only
just one type.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.165
Actually, there are hundreds
of types of kimchi... Okay.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.800
...but the one
that most people know

25:34.900 --> 25:36.935
and familiar with
are Napa cabbage.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.839
We have the original,
vegan version, a mild version--

25:40.939 --> 25:42.374
Did you try the--
The spicy's-- Whew.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.809
I was about to warn you about
the super spicy, yeah.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.511
That extra super spicy
is like whoa.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.547
Oh.
It's really hot.

25:48.647 --> 25:50.082
I want to know
about you guys.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.950
Like, how did you come up
with this idea?

25:52.084 --> 25:55.821
I needed some kimchi for
myself. And I live in New York.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.990
My folks live in Maryland,
so it's too far

25:58.090 --> 25:59.525
to go to Maryland
and bum a jar.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.362
So I would bring it back in
this exact cooler, our family cooler.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.931
And back then, I would wheel
it home on my skateboard.

26:06.031 --> 26:07.733
Wow.
So I asked my mom

26:07.833 --> 26:09.101
to teach me
how to make it.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.937
And then I was buying some
ribs, and the butcher's like,

26:12.037 --> 26:14.740
"Oh, eat that with some kimchi
and rice, eating like a king."

26:14.840 --> 26:18.310
So I said to him, "You know,
I sell this stuff." I didn't.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.646
And he said,
"I want to start carrying it."

26:20.746 --> 26:23.348
Now we are nationwide
through Whole Foods.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.817
Whole Foods. Wow.
We just got into--

26:24.917 --> 26:27.052
How much does it cost to make
and how much do you sell it
for?

26:27.152 --> 26:31.190
It costs us $2.65
to make a bag of kimchi,

26:31.290 --> 26:33.592
and it retails
from $8.99 and up.

26:33.692 --> 26:37.062
And the kimchi kit,
we make them for $8.25,

26:37.162 --> 26:39.264
and we wholesale for $20.

26:39.364 --> 26:40.666
So tell us
about your sales.

26:40.766 --> 26:44.336
Our top line sales
for last year was $815,000.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.938
- Wow. That's good.
- Nice. Okay.
- Good job.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.773
And what will sales be
this year?

26:47.873 --> 26:50.576
This year we are
projecting $1,000,000.

26:50.676 --> 26:51.877
And how much
will you make?

26:51.977 --> 26:53.745
25%.
Good for you.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.180
And is the majority of
your sales right now

26:55.280 --> 26:58.550
coming through Whole Foods
or is-- or direct to
consumer?

26:58.650 --> 27:02.754
We do almost zero online
sales. We have our own website.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.423
Really?
But that's--
that's not our focus.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.126
But we also partner
with Williams-Sonoma.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.660
Have you been in there
a long time?

27:08.760 --> 27:10.662
Probably about
eight years now.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.031
So why aren't
your sales higher?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.334
I built this company for $50
and a skateboard.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.470
So building it up,
I have zero outside investors.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.605
I've done
everything myself.

27:19.705 --> 27:20.806
So let me
re-ask the question,

27:20.906 --> 27:22.641
because you've got
the distribution.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.343
So what's holding you back
from being

27:24.443 --> 27:26.712
a $2 million,
$3 million, $5 million
company?

27:26.812 --> 27:28.947
Because I always thought the
way that businesses work

27:29.047 --> 27:31.517
is you-- you make money
in the business

27:31.617 --> 27:33.452
and then you can
hire more people

27:33.552 --> 27:34.753
instead of getting
any outside funding.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.688
Well, you are making money.
I'm assuming you pay yourself?

27:36.788 --> 27:38.090
Or is that part of
the $250,000?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.192
So I don't pay myself.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.327
I've invested the money
back into the business.

27:42.427 --> 27:43.829
Got it. Okay.
That makes more sense.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.598
So first of all, you started
this with $50 and a skateboard.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.600
I'm a mom.
I have sons.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.769
How does this
make you feel, Mama O,

27:50.869 --> 27:53.539
to see your son build
something like this?

27:53.639 --> 27:56.441
I am proud of him.
But more than anything,

27:56.542 --> 27:59.845
I am thankful
that he is an honest,

27:59.945 --> 28:04.249
hard-working entrepreneur
who is passionate about kimchi.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.187
He single-handedly
runs the kimchi business.

28:08.287 --> 28:12.891
Now, two years ago,
he met Amy and got married.

28:12.991 --> 28:15.961
They're expecting
their first baby next month.

28:16.061 --> 28:19.932
And Amy has lots of experience
in food business.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.569
She quit her well-paying job
and joined our company.

28:23.669 --> 28:29.308
So now we are a dream team
at the cusp of fantastic growth.

28:29.408 --> 28:33.212
So with your backing,
the sky's the limit.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.448
- Oh, I love that so much.
- That's really beautiful.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.252
You can't bring Mom like--
that's un-- That's unfair.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.486
You have $1 million
in sales.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.088
You know, I look at it
and say to myself,

28:43.188 --> 28:45.090
"You have to educate people
about what this is."

28:45.190 --> 28:47.759
And I think over time, as
people become much more concerned

28:47.859 --> 28:48.961
about healthy foods,

28:49.061 --> 28:50.596
this is gonna fit
in that category. Yeah.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.197
The hardest job
of this is actually

28:52.297 --> 28:54.066
getting people to try it.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.769
It's not for me, guys.
I'm sorry. I'm out.

28:57.869 --> 29:00.205
You guys, one of the hardest
things an entrepreneur has to do

29:00.305 --> 29:02.407
is determine when to add
their first employee,

29:02.507 --> 29:04.576
because you have to give up
a little bit of control

29:04.676 --> 29:06.445
when you try to go
for growth like that.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.114
But after eight
or nine years,

29:09.214 --> 29:12.150
there had to have been an
opportunity for you to do this.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.518
I just don't think
you're gonna be confident,

29:13.619 --> 29:15.120
and I think it's gonna
be hard for an investor

29:15.220 --> 29:19.725
to work with you,
so for those reasons, I'm out.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.593
As much as
I love you both

29:21.693 --> 29:23.362
and as much
as I love kimchi,

29:23.462 --> 29:26.265
and I think it's really spot
on for the future,

29:26.365 --> 29:28.233
it's just not
investable for me.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.769
And I'm sorry.
I'm out.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.704
Thank you.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.606
Your story
was so inspiring.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.743
And, Mama O, you are
one of a kind, truly.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.578
But if I'm gonna invest
in something,

29:39.678 --> 29:41.680
I got to be able to,
like, really stand behind it

29:41.780 --> 29:44.750
and sell it,
and I'm not a kimchi person.

29:44.850 --> 29:48.587
For that reason,
I just can't invest that amount.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.156
O'Leary: Daymond,
you're the last Shark.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.492
Tough one, because I--

29:53.592 --> 29:55.594
You've sold a good amount
over the years,

29:55.694 --> 29:58.363
but why do you feel
that you're ready to change

29:58.463 --> 30:00.565
the way you've been operating
with your family?

30:00.666 --> 30:02.634
Mm-hmm.
Why is this the time?

30:02.734 --> 30:05.003
We're-- We're expecting a
baby next month,

30:05.103 --> 30:06.972
so that's another mouth
to feed.

30:07.072 --> 30:08.240
Uh...

30:08.340 --> 30:11.977
Sharks, please,
if I may say something.

30:12.077 --> 30:13.578
Mama O's Kimchi Company

30:13.679 --> 30:18.650
needs money for capital
investment and expanding.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.986
That's why you came to
"Shark Tank," Mama O.
That's right.

30:21.086 --> 30:25.290
But not only money,
but your expertise,

30:25.390 --> 30:28.994
your direction,
your guidance, your support.

30:29.094 --> 30:32.964
I would like to have someone
to come in and teach us

30:33.065 --> 30:35.967
and then lead us
to that big market.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.136
That's why we are here.

30:38.236 --> 30:41.206
Well, I'm on the fence.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.809
And I think it's really
because of Mama O.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.878
She's--
She's definitely just amazing.

30:46.978 --> 30:48.780
I'm gonna have to trust,
I think, my gut.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.149
I'm not obsessed
with the product.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.918
I'm just obsessed
with the culture--

30:53.018 --> 30:55.253
You and Mama O,
and I--

30:55.354 --> 30:56.788
I hope I don't regret it.
No, you know what?

30:56.888 --> 30:59.224
I hope I do regret it,
but unfortunately, I'm out.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.094
Good luck, guys.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.897
Thank you for this opportunity
to swim with the Sharks.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.000
- Good luck.
- Congrats.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.474
Do I think the Sharks
made a mistake today?

31:15.574 --> 31:16.641
Absolutely.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.211
Mama O: Well,
the important thing

31:19.311 --> 31:25.417
is that we stay healthy
and love each other.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.053
100%.
That's the most
important thing.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.435
Next up
is a tool to help you

31:43.535 --> 31:47.172
become king or queen
of your own castle.

31:52.978 --> 31:55.380
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kevin Lane.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.783
And I'm Laurie Lane from
New Milford, Connecticut.

31:57.883 --> 32:02.854
We are seeking $350,000
for 10% equity in our company,

32:02.954 --> 32:04.956
Create A Castle.

32:05.056 --> 32:07.025
Everybody loves to vacation
at the beach.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.728
I know that I could lay in the
sun for hours with our daughter.

32:09.828 --> 32:11.997
Our son would stay in the
water all day if we let him.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.832
And if you're anything
like my husband here,

32:13.932 --> 32:16.601
you like to spend hours

32:16.701 --> 32:18.837
and hours
ignoring his family,

32:18.937 --> 32:21.139
building the most elaborate
sand castles.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.842
But it's impossible
to build a real sand castle

32:23.942 --> 32:26.378
using the traditional
fill-and-flip buckets.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.280
The wet sand sticks
in the bucket.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.182
Even at its best,
it just looks...

32:30.282 --> 32:31.683
boring.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.286
That's why we invented
Create A Castle,

32:34.386 --> 32:37.189
revolutionary split-mold
sand castle kits

32:37.289 --> 32:39.691
that allow you to build
elaborate sand structures

32:39.791 --> 32:41.226
in no time at all.

32:41.326 --> 32:44.629
Just buckle it,
pack it, unbuckle it

32:44.729 --> 32:48.934
and, well,
create a castle.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.704
Our pro kit includes a 10-inch
cylinder for the base.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.207
A corbel to add a new
level of intricacy.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.176
A stackable 6-inch piece
for additional height.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.413
A ridge battlement brick form
to add to the towers.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.382
And a window cutter to edge
out elegant windows.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.052
Then sit back, relax,
and enjoy the admiration

33:07.152 --> 33:08.420
of everyone on the beach.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.989
So, Sharks, who wants to
create an empire with us

33:11.089 --> 33:14.292
bringing families together
one castle at a time with...

33:14.392 --> 33:16.595
Create A Castle?

33:16.695 --> 33:18.363
I have six kids.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.799
I'm a mom and bonus mom
to six kids, okay?

33:20.899 --> 33:22.167
Alright.
That's awesome. Awesome.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.036
So we spend a lot of time
on the beach, and I love this.

33:25.136 --> 33:27.405
Is there anything
like this out there?

33:27.506 --> 33:29.441
I feel like
I've seen something similar.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.109
Nothing like this.
We're unique

33:31.209 --> 33:34.079
in the fact that we split--
so the molds split in half,

33:34.179 --> 33:36.515
but they also are stackable
on the right kind of sand.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.216
You built
that entire castle?

33:38.316 --> 33:39.651
Yeah.
How long did that take?

33:39.751 --> 33:41.887
That took me
under two hours.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.121
Wow.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.256
O'Leary: I see a patent.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.624
Do you want to
tell us about that?

33:45.724 --> 33:46.858
Yeah, so go ahead.
We have--

33:46.958 --> 33:49.361
Yeah, we have
12 patents worldwide.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.495
- 12?
- 12?

33:50.595 --> 33:51.796
- Wow.
- 12.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.265
Does your patent--
You believe that protects you

33:53.365 --> 33:55.767
against anybody who wants to
start splitting their toys
open?

33:55.867 --> 33:56.968
We have--
We have broad coverage.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.538
It scales up and down.
That's why we're going down

33:59.638 --> 34:02.040
into the indoor line now
as well.

34:02.140 --> 34:06.444
Alright, guys, look, this is
a very, very seasonal product.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.013
It works in the snow.

34:08.113 --> 34:09.714
- Oh.
- Wow.

34:09.814 --> 34:12.884
Thank you,
Mr. Wonderful. Perfect.

34:13.018 --> 34:15.320
So, yeah, so it does--
It works year round.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.956
We figured that out
the first year we did it.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.791
And you can stack
like crazy.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.326
It's like Elsa's castle
in the winter.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.061
That's it.
We've built it.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.429
See?

34:24.529 --> 34:26.298
I was about to say,
who wants a castle in a
winter?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.867
But Elsa, yeah. Elsa.

34:28.967 --> 34:30.635
So, guys,
what are the price ranges?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.837
What's the least
and what's the most?

34:32.938 --> 34:35.106
So, we go the tool kit
that we have there,

34:35.206 --> 34:36.975
the small box,
that's $10,

34:37.075 --> 34:39.511
and then the pro kit
retails for $50.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.212
What's your landed cost
on those?

34:41.313 --> 34:43.114
The little one
is landed at $2.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.483
The pro kit,
that costs us $9.45.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.085
So what did you sell
last year?

34:47.185 --> 34:49.621
You're imputing a value
of $3.5 million on this.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.290
Last year,
we did $600,000.

34:52.390 --> 34:54.826
And then this year,
we are doing $3 million.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.061
- Whoa!
-$3 million?!

34:56.161 --> 34:57.696
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa!

34:57.796 --> 34:58.897
- How did that just happen?
- Are you kidding me?

34:58.997 --> 35:00.065
What happened?

35:00.165 --> 35:01.700
We landed Costco Canada
as well as Sam's Club.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.001
And Sam's Club.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.337
On the $600,000
in sales last year,

35:05.437 --> 35:06.738
what did you make
on that?

35:06.838 --> 35:09.641
We were actually
negative $100,000.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.010
We lost money last year.
Why?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.145
And that was really due
to the shipping costs

35:14.245 --> 35:15.847
were like 5X
what we had budgeted.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.349
Because of COVID.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.251
Yeah. Like, we used to
get a container in for,

35:20.352 --> 35:21.820
you know, $4,000 to $6,000,

35:21.920 --> 35:23.221
and, you know, a couple of
our containers last year

35:23.321 --> 35:24.990
were $25,000.
- Right.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.257
And the $3 million
in sales,

35:26.358 --> 35:28.493
including the Costco
and Sam's Club order,

35:28.593 --> 35:29.928
what do you think
you'll make on that?

35:30.028 --> 35:32.831
This year, we're gonna make
about $300,000.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.966
What is your margin
to Costco then?

35:35.066 --> 35:38.603
The margin we made,
about 27% to 32% margins.

35:38.703 --> 35:39.804
So that's part of
your challenge, yeah.

35:39.904 --> 35:41.039
It was definitely a lot less, yeah.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.508
Okay. What are you
looking for help for?

35:43.608 --> 35:47.112
'Cause right now, it looks
like you are scaling really well.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.613
I understand
you need to reduce costs,

35:48.713 --> 35:50.615
but what else
are you looking for?

35:50.715 --> 35:54.285
I think mostly we need,
you know, with the capital

35:54.386 --> 35:56.955
that we're asking for,
to invest into more product.

35:57.055 --> 36:00.291
And we just need expertise.
We've made so many mistakes.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.360
And we're expanding
into a whole--

36:02.460 --> 36:04.663
We want to open up
a whole licensing version.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.431
A what?
A licensing version.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.000
- Did you say "Daymond"?
- Ohh.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.202
O'Leary: You're looking
for $350,000.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.672
I'm gonna assume
that's primarily for
inventory. Yes.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.007
And you're trying to figure
out the Costco order

36:16.107 --> 36:18.843
translating into
a US Costco order, correct?

36:18.943 --> 36:20.045
'Cause a lot of people
test up in Canada.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.379
Are you sure?
Yeah, not necessarily.

36:21.479 --> 36:22.881
Are you sure that you can
make money off of that order?

36:22.981 --> 36:24.282
Yeah.
Not necessarily.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.117
I mean, we've learned a lot
getting into the big-box
stores.

36:26.217 --> 36:28.019
O'Leary: Are you going to make
money on the Costco order?

36:28.119 --> 36:29.120
'Cause they're gonna ask you

36:29.220 --> 36:31.022
for some co-op advertising
as well.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.957
Right. For--
That and markdowns.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.726
Yeah. Yeah.
You know, we know--

36:34.826 --> 36:37.462
And they have the right
to return the last 15% of it?

36:37.562 --> 36:39.097
Yes. So--
Okay, so we've all--

36:39.197 --> 36:41.566
Sounds like you've had
returns and markdowns.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.068
Yes. Yes.
We've been experiencing that. Yep.

36:43.168 --> 36:45.904
And that's that's impacted
your 27% margins even worse.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.272
Yes.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.807
Yeah, guys, I think there's
too much of an emphasis

36:48.907 --> 36:50.575
on sales
rather than profits.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.445
Every entrepreneur gets really
hype about doing business

36:53.545 --> 36:55.346
with big-box retailers.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.449
But the reality is
it's just gonna

36:57.549 --> 36:59.718
take more and more cash,
like you found out.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.887
And so, you know, chasing
margin and profits is good.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.222
Chasing sales, in my mind,

37:04.322 --> 37:07.392
particularly in these
uncertain days, is bad.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.195
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.730
Okay.
O'Leary: Guys, guys,
let me tell you where I'm at.

37:11.830 --> 37:12.997
I'm looking at
the business model

37:13.098 --> 37:14.532
strictly-- strictly
as an investment.

37:14.632 --> 37:17.168
Anytime it's $350,000,
that's serious capital.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.804
I'm not even gonna beat you up
on the $3.5 million valuation,

37:19.904 --> 37:21.039
although I should.

37:21.139 --> 37:22.273
It's in my DNA to do that.

37:22.373 --> 37:23.475
But I'm gonna hold back

37:23.575 --> 37:25.176
'cause I'm under
anger management this year.

37:25.276 --> 37:28.580
So at the end of the day,
it's not investable yet

37:28.680 --> 37:31.516
because the business model
isn't nailed down.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.285
My sense is to dump
the low-end completely,

37:34.385 --> 37:35.687
raise the prices 30%,

37:35.787 --> 37:38.523
sell only on
your own website direct.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.291
Otherwise you're never
gonna make any money.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.060
I'm out.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.394
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.396
Listen, I-I don't
agree with what he just said.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.499
Your price point,
I think, is excellent.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.035
And I have always found I like
to make products for the masses.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.571
I like to make things
where everybody can afford

37:53.671 --> 37:55.774
and enjoy it.
But I think for me,

37:55.874 --> 37:57.475
it's not something
that I want to invest in.

37:57.575 --> 38:00.278
I don't invest in
everything that I like.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.781
You're doing everything right,
and I wish you good luck,

38:02.881 --> 38:04.516
but I'm out.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.888
I absolutely love
this product.
Thank you.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.590
It brings me joy.
And I love your price point.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.592
And I actually totally
disagree with Kevin.

38:14.692 --> 38:18.263
I think you want a balance
of wholesale and retail.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.198
Now, coming from
a retailer myself

38:20.298 --> 38:23.034
who sells in omni-channel--
I sell wholesale,

38:23.134 --> 38:24.736
I sell direct to consumer online,

38:24.836 --> 38:26.471
and I have my own
retail stores--

38:26.571 --> 38:28.940
I think you can do it
very thoughtfully.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.675
Now, some of
the discount retailers,

38:30.775 --> 38:33.511
I will agree with Kevin,
can absolutely kill you.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.713
So be thoughtful
about where you go.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.516
But I think
you've got a home run.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.418
I'm going to give
you an offer.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.320
I'm gonna give you
your $350,000,

38:42.420 --> 38:45.356
but I don't think
your valuation's $3.5 million.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.859
Okay.
You lost $100,000 last year.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.694
So I don't see
the $3.5 million.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.496
But I do see that
there's going to be

38:51.596 --> 38:53.865
great potential
and opportunity.

38:53.965 --> 38:57.335
I'd like to give you
$350,000 for 20%,

38:57.435 --> 39:00.071
and I think I can help you
with that omni-channel,

39:00.171 --> 39:02.106
which I do think is gonna
help you build the business

39:02.207 --> 39:03.641
the way you want to build it.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.743
Okay.
Awesome.

39:07.478 --> 39:10.515
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.329
Three
Sharks are out.

39:24.429 --> 39:29.334
Kendra has made an offer
of $350,000 for a 20% stake

39:29.434 --> 39:31.836
in Kevin and Laurie's
sand castle toy,

39:31.936 --> 39:35.240
Create A Castle.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.876
I think I can help you
with that omni-channel,

39:37.976 --> 39:39.944
which I do think is gonna
help you build the business

39:40.044 --> 39:41.779
the way you want to build it.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.583
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

39:45.683 --> 39:48.319
I like this,
but Mark has a valid point.

39:48.419 --> 39:51.856
You know, this is gonna be
your personal decision, right?

39:51.956 --> 39:55.727
Do you raise the price,
stay online,

39:55.827 --> 39:57.862
and, you know, net more,

39:57.962 --> 39:59.931
or do you want to go big?

40:00.031 --> 40:02.467
Do you bring in a Shark
and you go big?

40:02.567 --> 40:06.371
But if you go big,
it's a huge cash-suck.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.739
Massive.

40:07.839 --> 40:11.676
So I'm only interested in this
for the licensing aspect.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.778
That's a personal decision,
but I will give you

40:13.878 --> 40:17.448
the $350,000 for 25%.

40:17.548 --> 40:19.317
And licensing is the key. Okay.
Awesome. Thank you.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.319
You know, look,
I disagree with Daymond.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.788
I don't think this is
just a licensing play.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.423
And I don't see why
you guys can't be

40:25.523 --> 40:27.091
the next big toy manufacturer.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.426
So that's what
I want to do.

40:28.526 --> 40:29.694
I want you to dream big,

40:29.794 --> 40:30.828
and I think I can
help you get there.

40:30.929 --> 40:31.963
By the way,
when I say dream big,

40:32.063 --> 40:34.565
I'm talking about big.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.634
So--
What do you want to do?

40:39.837 --> 40:44.509
Would you guys ever work
together with the licensing?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.144
I would love to work with her,
but in this area,

40:46.244 --> 40:48.279
I'm the most successful
licensing guy up here.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.914
That's my area.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.250
And I'm a brand builder.
I built my own brand,

40:52.350 --> 40:54.719
right, from the ground up
out of my extra bedroom.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.054
O'Leary: So I'm gonna
interpret that for you.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.855
They said, no, they don't
want to work together.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.190
What do you want to do?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.059
You can counter.

41:07.398 --> 41:08.733
You want to counter?
Yeah.

41:08.833 --> 41:12.770
Would you be interested
at 15%?

41:12.870 --> 41:16.708
I'd like to stay at 20%.
Okay.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.942
I'm gonna let you
make the call.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.979
She makes the decisions.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.649
What do you think?
Do you want to do the license,

41:24.749 --> 41:26.351
or do you want to do--
build the brand?

41:26.451 --> 41:29.253
It's up to you.

41:29.354 --> 41:32.490
I respect both of you--
all of you guys anyways.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.125
Absolutely.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.661
But I think we're gonna go
with Kendra at the 20%.

41:36.761 --> 41:37.862
- Whoo!
- Congrats.

41:37.962 --> 41:39.197
I'm sorry, Daymond.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.332
Let's make some
sand castles together.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.267
Oh, bad choice.

41:43.368 --> 41:45.870
- So exciting. So exciting.
- Thank you.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.772
Yay! Oh, my God.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.474
- Let's go!
- Congrats, guys. Well done.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.242
Thank you. Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

41:51.342 --> 41:54.345
Sorry, Daymond.
Thank you so much.

41:54.445 --> 41:56.414
One of the reasons we went
with Kendra is,

41:56.514 --> 41:58.649
from the get-go,
when we walked in there,

41:58.750 --> 42:00.585
she was so excited
about the products

42:00.685 --> 42:02.487
and totally
was invested in us

42:02.587 --> 42:04.389
and, you know, talked about
the beach and her kids.

42:04.489 --> 42:06.691
So we knew she would be
the perfect fit for us.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.160
- I love this product.
- It's very cute.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.329
I love it, and I'm gonna
use it with my kids.

42:11.429 --> 42:12.463
That's a massively--

42:12.563 --> 42:13.965
- Don't do it.
- Ohhh.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.566
That's a bad deal.

42:15.666 --> 42:19.003
Oh, you know, I mean,
I just-- I just think--

42:19.103 --> 42:21.706
I think they're
a bad judge of character.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.574
I'm gonna go try
to build it back up.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.043
Ohh.
Go ahead. We'll wait.
