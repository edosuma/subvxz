we are liars?

20:35.737 --> 20:39.310
Are you saying something's
wrong with my body?

20:41.783 --> 20:44.220
'Cause I'm wondering
where you get the confidence

20:44.354 --> 20:46.425
to be so revealing
with your, um...

20:46.559 --> 20:48.328
stupidity?

As your host, I want to say

23:04.033 --> 23:07.106
thanks for coming,
so I could show you all how

23:07.173 --> 23:09.277
strongly I feel about the ball

23:09.344 --> 23:11.649

How could you embarrass me

23:40.339 --> 23:41.676
-like that?
-Embarrass you?

23:41.776 --> 23:44.447
You're not the one
bowing in six-inch heels...

23:44.515 --> 23:46.318
to a dude named Thatcher.

23:46.418 --> 23:47.921
You have not wanted
anything to do

23:47.988 --> 23:49.525
with this ball
since the beginning.

23:49.591 --> 23:52.430
Yeah, because all of this
does not make me happy.

23:52.531 --> 23:55.402
Rescuing horses does,
taking care of them,

23:55.469 --> 23:57.541

anyone else who will.

23:59.812 --> 24:01.481
NICKY:
Geeg, there you are.

24:01.549 --> 24:03.285
Did you, did you tell her
to do that?

24:03.385 --> 24:04.922
GIGI:
Of course not.

24:04.989 --> 24:07.293
Well, I told her
that she should try

24:07.360 --> 24:09.030
to make you understand
how she was feeling.

24:09.097 --> 24:11.167
Great, now all of Austin
knows how she feels.

24:11.267 --> 24:12.470
Why, why would you do that?

24:12.571 --> 24:14.007
You don't listen to her, Nicky.

24:14.107 --> 24:16.478
It's my fault. I can see why
you two are so close.

24:16.545 --> 24:18.048
Are you serious?

24:18.148 --> 24:19.818
I was doing this to help you.

24:19.885 --> 24:21.622
By turning my daughter
against me?

24:21.656 --> 24:22.858
How is that helping me?

24:22.958 --> 24:24.595
I was trying to make sure
that she wouldn't

24:24.662 --> 24:26.331
spend the rest of her life
resenting you.

24:26.398 --> 24:27.701
'Cause I know
what it's like to have

24:27.768 --> 24:29.370
a mom who only cares about

24:29.470 --> 24:31.575
looking normal
instead of being normal.

24:31.676 --> 24:34.080
Or how you look
instead of what you feel.

24:34.147 --> 24:35.349
I thought you would do

24:35.416 --> 24:37.219
a better job
with your kids than Mama did.

24:38.288 --> 24:39.457
But I guess I was wrong.

24:39.525 --> 24:41.227
(Gigi sighs)

24:44.267 --> 24:46.304
NICKY:
Hey.

24:47.073 --> 24:49.344
I'm sure this is
a poorly-timed question,

24:49.444 --> 24:51.716
-but are you all right?
-(scoffs)

24:52.984 --> 24:55.523
Can you get me
out of here, please?

24:55.623 --> 24:57.928
Isn't this your house?

24:58.930 --> 25:00.399
Rewind.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.938
What I meant to say is "yes."

25:12.524 --> 25:14.895
(door closes)

25:16.398 --> 25:18.235
What did you do?

25:18.301 --> 25:20.239
I...

25:20.305 --> 25:23.011
ordered every dessert
on the menu.

25:24.347 --> 25:27.153
Not the response
I was going for.

25:27.219 --> 25:29.725
I can't eat that.

25:31.662 --> 25:33.533
I don't eat that.

25:33.599 --> 25:36.104
Why not live a little?

25:36.171 --> 25:37.741
Mmm!

25:37.841 --> 25:39.410
Ooh.

25:39.477 --> 25:41.247
Oh, it's so good.

25:41.381 --> 25:42.918
Come on, try and let go.

25:42.984 --> 25:45.590
-It's not as hard as you think.
-I beg to differ.

25:46.826 --> 25:48.395
If I don't hold on tight
to everything,

25:48.462 --> 25:49.832
then it all falls apart--
my family,

25:49.898 --> 25:51.969
my kids...

25:52.036 --> 25:54.006
my legacy.

25:54.140 --> 25:55.677

26:17.721 --> 26:20.794
(clears throat)
...what's going on?

26:21.662 --> 26:24.434
That blood you found
in Clive's car is mine.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.804
What?

26:27.006 --> 26:29.878
Clive was a hound dog,
you know that.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.586
The night he went missing,
I confronted him

26:33.686 --> 26:37.126
about the way that...
he treated Nicky.

26:37.226 --> 26:39.230
Things got physical.

26:39.297 --> 26:41.034
How physical?

26:41.134 --> 26:43.205
Well, I beat
the hell out of him.

26:43.271 --> 26:45.008
But, I mean, he was fine.

26:45.075 --> 26:47.446
Wasn't nothing a couple shots
of whiskey wouldn't fix.

26:47.547 --> 26:49.383
That drop of blood

26:49.518 --> 26:52.891
now makes you the primary
suspect in his disappearance.

26:52.924 --> 26:54.962
That's why
you ain't gonna run it.

26:55.028 --> 26:57.133
It's... (laughs)
It's material evidence.

26:57.233 --> 27:00.339

I can't just sit on it.

27:00.439 --> 27:01.709
You can.

27:01.775 --> 27:03.378
And you will.

27:03.478 --> 27:04.948
Let me explain something here.

27:05.015 --> 27:08.455
This case involves multiple
law enforcement agencies.

27:08.523 --> 27:10.593
My hands are tied.

27:10.627 --> 27:13.699
I suggest you figure out
a way to untie them.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.637
What are you asking here?

27:15.703 --> 27:17.641
You want me to just trash

everything that I've built?

27:19.745 --> 27:21.816
You have everything

27:21.916 --> 27:24.521
you've built because of me.

Let's not forget

you were just trying to help.

29:32.209 --> 29:35.015
And Tatum agreed to finish
the ball, so thank you.

29:36.284 --> 29:39.490
But with everything that's
going on, I haven't exactly been

29:39.558 --> 29:41.194
mother of the year.

29:41.294 --> 29:43.365
It's a wonder,
with the role model we had.

29:43.465 --> 29:45.570
No matter what you say, Mama
would never fly off the handle.

29:45.637 --> 29:46.772
She'd always be in control.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.343
It's easy when you don't have
the burden of a conscience.

29:49.410 --> 29:52.249
You're a better mother
than she ever was anyway.

29:52.316 --> 29:53.919
Even to me.

29:54.755 --> 29:56.124
You remember what she did

29:56.190 --> 29:58.028
the night I came out to her?

29:58.128 --> 29:59.397
No.

29:59.463 --> 30:01.568
You must've blocked that out.

30:02.737 --> 30:04.440
NICKY:
This isn't right.

30:04.508 --> 30:06.411
DOTTIE:
You don't get to tell me

30:06.477 --> 30:07.681
what's right, Nicolette.

30:07.747 --> 30:10.118
You can make me do
whatever you want, Mama.

30:10.185 --> 30:12.456
I want to be just like you,
but Gigi's different.

30:12.524 --> 30:16.297
She's a wonderful person, and
I won't let you break her down.

30:19.838 --> 30:21.875
As rough as Mama was on you,

30:21.975 --> 30:23.879
I never once saw you stand up
for yourself.

30:23.946 --> 30:25.382
But you always stood up for me.

30:26.217 --> 30:29.591
And as much as I hate
that Violet Crown,

30:29.658 --> 30:33.766
it reminds me how lucky I am
to have a sister like you

30:33.866 --> 30:35.469
watching over me.

30:35.536 --> 30:38.341
Hey. Hey.

30:39.343 --> 30:41.047
And I always will.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.153
Speaking of which,

30:44.220 --> 30:45.990
that reporter
at the pool party...

30:46.057 --> 30:47.727
-She was out of line.
-Yes,

30:47.794 --> 30:49.263
but...

30:49.330 --> 30:50.733
fame, it gives you
a kind of power

30:50.800 --> 30:52.403
and it's very intoxicating.

30:52.469 --> 30:54.173
You should enjoy it.

30:54.206 --> 30:56.545
But you got to be careful
that you don't...

30:56.612 --> 30:58.014
What?

30:58.849 --> 31:00.352
Turn into Mama.

31:00.419 --> 31:01.922
Mm-hmm.

31:02.824 --> 31:04.326
Oh. Yeah.

31:04.393 --> 31:05.429
Wow.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.134
(insects trilling)

31:08.201 --> 31:10.873
(chuckles softly)
This is a fairy tale.

31:13.211 --> 31:15.516
(sighs) Are you sure
I'm not gonna fall asleep

31:15.616 --> 31:17.486
and wake up back in Albuquerque?

31:17.554 --> 31:19.423
It's all real.

31:21.127 --> 31:23.431
And you're
exactly where you belong.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.503
Here.

31:26.471 --> 31:27.507
With me.

31:28.642 --> 31:29.945
Hmm.

31:30.011 --> 31:31.648
We have to go to the Deb Ball.

31:31.749 --> 31:34.320
If anyone deserves
the Violet Crown,

31:34.420 --> 31:35.489
it's you.

31:35.623 --> 31:38.662
Seems like the Deb Ball
is important to both of us.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.469
My family's counting on me.

31:43.471 --> 31:45.710
Forget about the pressure
from your family.

31:45.810 --> 31:48.883
