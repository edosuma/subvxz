WEBVTT

00:10.793 --> 00:14.328
I think that people
would feel this presence.

00:15.260 --> 00:18.670
I got scratched down the middle of my back.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.701
This guy has got (bleep) issues.

00:21.731 --> 00:24.142
Well, he pulls out his
pistol, shoots him five times

00:24.172 --> 00:25.637
in the chest.

00:26.588 --> 00:29.592
I'm scared for myself,
for our whole family.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.896
He's really creepy.

00:33.151 --> 00:35.730
He's a sociopath.

00:36.485 --> 00:38.568
Something bad's going to happen.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.837
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.427
There's panic.

00:42.457 --> 00:43.996
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:44.026 --> 00:45.347
I see dead people.

00:45.377 --> 00:47.416
They all died horribly.

00:47.446 --> 00:48.751
I speak to dead people.

00:48.781 --> 00:50.619
Get out of here.

00:50.649 --> 00:52.087
And they speak to me.

00:52.117 --> 00:53.587
Vicious.

00:53.952 --> 00:56.992
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.022 --> 00:58.827
It doesn't matter where
you are. I'll find you.

00:58.857 --> 01:00.362
I rely on my partner.

01:00.392 --> 01:01.830
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.999
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.029 --> 01:05.584
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:05.614 --> 01:08.870
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.238
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:10.268 --> 01:12.107
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.137 --> 01:13.570
This is not good.

01:13.605 --> 01:15.394
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.424 --> 01:17.462
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.492 --> 01:19.498
Until the very end...

01:19.528 --> 01:20.832
I want my life back.

01:20.862 --> 01:22.918
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:22.948 --> 01:24.447
Is he trying to kill her?

01:24.533 --> 01:25.749
Or time to get out.

01:25.779 --> 01:27.356
Oh, my God.

01:27.386 --> 01:29.138
This is going to kill us.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:43.819 --> 01:45.007
I'm in Coupland, Texas.

01:45.037 --> 01:47.587
It's a small city just outside of Austin.

01:48.707 --> 01:53.193
I got called in by a mother
of two who sounded really bad.

01:53.312 --> 01:54.466
She got married a couple of years ago

01:54.496 --> 01:55.801
and moved in with her new husband.

01:55.831 --> 01:58.453
Then, all hell broke loose.

01:58.483 --> 01:59.699
She's scared for her kids,

01:59.785 --> 02:03.153
she's scared for herself
and she's just plain scared.

02:03.238 --> 02:05.989
She told me she's got
no one else to turn to.

02:11.296 --> 02:12.429
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.531 --> 02:15.732
I clear the house of
any leading information,

02:15.817 --> 02:18.802
removing family photos
and other personal items

02:18.937 --> 02:22.105
that may influence her findings.

02:22.207 --> 02:26.259
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:33.452 --> 02:35.285
Last night,

02:35.370 --> 02:41.524
I had an encounter with
a dead person, a male.

02:41.626 --> 02:43.365
My shirt was kind of lifted

02:43.395 --> 02:46.896
and my stomach was, like, caressed.

02:46.998 --> 02:51.768
It was inappropriate, and
the touch was very cold.

02:56.074 --> 02:58.830
There's two females that are alive,

02:58.860 --> 03:02.879
who think, he's some kind of a perv.

03:02.998 --> 03:06.471
He is the main person here

03:07.936 --> 03:10.478
who's causing problems for the living.

03:16.528 --> 03:17.782
Well, Sharon, I'm glad I'm here

03:17.812 --> 03:19.150
because listening to you on the phone

03:19.480 --> 03:22.980
and how scared you guys are
here was real concerning to me.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.185
What's going on?

03:25.237 --> 03:27.291
Well, we're being terrorized in our home.

03:27.321 --> 03:28.694
Okay, what are we talking about?

03:28.724 --> 03:31.327
From being pushed and shoved

03:31.357 --> 03:35.729
to a lot of things that
are a lot worse than that.

03:35.814 --> 03:36.868
When you say a lot worse,
you're talking about?

03:36.898 --> 03:38.732
Being touched intimately.

03:43.363 --> 03:44.355
It's okay.

03:44.385 --> 03:45.310
Yeah, I mean, there's
things that are just...

03:45.340 --> 03:46.645
it's just horrible.

03:46.675 --> 03:49.309
Things are happening in
our house, at this point.

03:49.384 --> 03:51.290
And it's just I'm scared for myself

03:51.320 --> 03:54.193
and for our whole family.

03:55.257 --> 03:57.524
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

03:57.626 --> 03:59.409
This is why we took the case.

03:59.528 --> 04:01.027
We're at a breaking point.

04:01.113 --> 04:02.557
I told my husband, I was like,

04:02.587 --> 04:04.503
"I'm done. I can't do this."

04:04.533 --> 04:05.987
Now, who exactly are you living here with?

04:06.017 --> 04:08.084
Here is a photo of our family.

04:08.136 --> 04:09.391
There's myself,

04:09.421 --> 04:12.005
and my husband J.D., our son Nicholas,

04:12.090 --> 04:16.810
our only daughter, Madelyn,
and our middle son, Jacob.

04:16.894 --> 04:19.646
I understand you got married recently.

04:19.731 --> 04:22.182
Did you and J.D. buy this place together?

04:22.267 --> 04:25.090
No, he built the home in 2006.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.958
And now how long have you been living here?

04:26.988 --> 04:29.428
We've lived here for the last two years.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.290
Now, when did it start getting
really bad for you guys?

04:32.320 --> 04:33.765
Not until about seven months ago.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.167
- Seven months ago?
- Mm-hmm.

04:35.197 --> 04:37.235
Is everybody on this
photo having experiences?

04:37.265 --> 04:39.816
It's mostly the women in the house.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.239
It's me, it's my daughter.

04:41.269 --> 04:44.237
We're the ones being
physically attacked in the home.

04:44.339 --> 04:46.923
Like, you don't even
want to change clothes,

04:47.042 --> 04:49.047
because if like... if
there were a peeping Tom

04:49.077 --> 04:52.011
in your window watching you.

04:52.097 --> 04:54.113
I'm just ready for this to be over.

04:54.715 --> 04:56.416
This has been a nightmare for us.

04:59.254 --> 05:02.522
The dead guy who touched
me last night is in here.

05:02.624 --> 05:04.924
This guy's not good.

05:05.076 --> 05:07.909
I feel like he's in here a lot.

05:08.613 --> 05:13.249
It makes you feel like
you're being studied.

05:13.351 --> 05:17.053
I think that people
would feel this presence.

05:17.155 --> 05:22.125
This... like you're under
a microscope or something.

05:25.547 --> 05:28.648
He's really creepy.

05:28.733 --> 05:31.284
I don't think he has a conscience.

05:36.591 --> 05:39.843
This is the most active
place in the whole house.

05:39.961 --> 05:44.469
We've seen, like, a black
mass, kind of like a cloud.

05:44.499 --> 05:46.672
- Okay.
- Another time, laying in the bed,

05:46.702 --> 05:49.307
I sat straight up when I saw him.

05:49.337 --> 05:51.550
And it was a man standing
at the end of my bed.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.445
And it was like he had on a trench coat

05:53.475 --> 05:54.970
and almost like a fedora hat.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.376
And how often are you seeing him?

05:56.478 --> 05:59.012
Pretty much all the time.

05:59.304 --> 06:00.352
Anything else going on in here?

06:00.382 --> 06:03.983
I got scratched... this burn
down the middle of my back.

06:04.085 --> 06:06.152
And my husband lifted my shirt

06:06.238 --> 06:09.589
and he was like "You've
got a huge scratch down..."

06:09.619 --> 06:12.492
It was right, perfect in
between my shoulder blades.

06:12.522 --> 06:14.394
- Nothing else could have caused that?
- Nothing.

06:14.479 --> 06:15.895
No cats or anything running around here?

06:15.925 --> 06:17.363
Un-uh.

06:19.696 --> 06:21.503
There's something burning.

06:23.705 --> 06:25.493
Yeah, like a burning sensation

06:25.523 --> 06:30.543
with, like, little prickles of heat.

06:30.629 --> 06:33.652
I'm gonna assume that
somebody in this location

06:33.682 --> 06:34.953
is having this experience

06:34.983 --> 06:38.818
and it is associated with
this younger dead male.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.421
It's possible somebody is getting cut.

06:41.523 --> 06:47.894
There is this physical agitation
that's happening to somebody.

06:51.833 --> 06:55.501
All right, ls there anything else going on?

06:55.604 --> 06:59.973
One night we were in bed, and I woke up

07:00.003 --> 07:02.625
and I could feel two
hands around my throat.

07:02.655 --> 07:03.709
I was being choked.

07:03.739 --> 07:05.250
And I could feel the thumbs

07:05.280 --> 07:08.281
especially just pushing down so far.

07:08.311 --> 07:12.485
And I was just, like...
and could not breathe.

07:12.620 --> 07:13.742
You sure it wasn't a nightmare?

07:13.772 --> 07:17.140
I was wide awake, sitting
there trying to wake my husband.

07:17.258 --> 07:20.343
But that was your breaking
point was getting choked?

07:20.428 --> 07:22.996
No, that one wasn't.

07:23.098 --> 07:24.464
What was?

07:24.566 --> 07:31.571
We were in bed and it felt
like something running its nail

07:31.656 --> 07:33.745
along the backside of my leg.

07:33.775 --> 07:35.909
I was touched...

07:37.772 --> 07:39.612
very intimately touched.

07:39.642 --> 07:40.863
Did it feel like a man's hands,

07:40.893 --> 07:42.387
or could you even tell what it felt like?

07:42.417 --> 07:43.483
I knew it was a man.

07:43.513 --> 07:44.617
Okay.

07:44.647 --> 07:45.518
That was my breaking point,

07:45.603 --> 07:48.021
because I was like,
"If it'll do that to me,

07:48.123 --> 07:50.556
what could it do to my daughter?"

07:50.642 --> 07:52.492
We have got to get help.

07:52.627 --> 07:54.394
We have to get help.

07:57.265 --> 08:01.000
This younger dude, he's being nasty.

08:01.102 --> 08:06.622
He's saying that this (bleep) deserves

08:08.565 --> 08:10.510
whatever he's doing to her.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.715
I feel a lot of choking right away,

08:15.817 --> 08:17.583
a lot of pressure in the head.

08:17.613 --> 08:18.690
Really bad.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.354
Pressure in the jaw really bad.

08:21.423 --> 08:24.924
Having the breath knocked out of you often.

08:30.701 --> 08:33.005
So, Mattie, I was talking
to Mom and she was telling me

08:33.034 --> 08:35.534
about what you guys are
going through in here.

08:35.587 --> 08:36.587
You're how old now?

08:36.639 --> 08:37.905
I'm about to turn 15.

08:38.006 --> 08:39.890
Mom said you've been having experiences.

08:40.009 --> 08:42.009
I'll be laying in bed and, you know,

08:42.039 --> 08:46.613
and my door will be
open and I'll see, like,

08:46.715 --> 08:50.810
a shadow figure just walk
past my door, like, real quick.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.205
It looks like a shadow,
but, you know, more 3D.

08:55.324 --> 08:56.993
Like, in a month it probably

08:57.023 --> 08:58.413
would happen about two times.

08:58.443 --> 09:00.849
And you're positive it's
not somebody walking past.

09:00.879 --> 09:02.134
I'm positive.

09:02.164 --> 09:04.270
I hate to even ask you this,
but is there anything else?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.071
I was laying down in my bed

09:06.101 --> 09:08.791
and I got up to go to the
kitchen to get a drink,

09:08.821 --> 09:11.805
and right as I was about
to walk out of my door...

09:11.835 --> 09:15.397
the frame of my door, I got
shoved back into my guitars

09:15.427 --> 09:17.394
that are right by the foot of my bed.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.500
And it cut me.

09:18.530 --> 09:19.835
There was blood.

09:19.865 --> 09:20.702
That night when I got pushed,

09:20.732 --> 09:23.683
I just sat in my bed and I cried.

09:23.713 --> 09:26.121
How much do you and Mom
talk about this stuff?

09:26.151 --> 09:29.286
She's told me a lot...
everything, honestly,

09:29.388 --> 09:30.821
that's happened to her.

09:30.923 --> 09:32.144
And it does scare me,

09:32.174 --> 09:36.015
because if it's willing to
do that to her who, you know,

09:36.045 --> 09:38.345
- has her husband by her side,
- Right.

09:38.375 --> 09:40.836
then what could happen to me

09:40.866 --> 09:42.217
when I'm on the other
side of the house, alone?

09:42.247 --> 09:45.419
- Right.
- So, that definitely scares me.

09:48.524 --> 09:50.591
I know he's in here a lot.

09:54.580 --> 09:55.946
This living person

09:55.976 --> 10:00.984
might be influenced by
this dead man's behaviors.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.294
He's a sociopath.

10:06.324 --> 10:11.595
So, he wants to be in
control, be in charge.

10:11.680 --> 10:16.199
He is just staring me the (bleep) down.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.826
So, J.D., I was talking to your wife

10:44.856 --> 10:46.527
and she was telling me
about the horrific things

10:46.557 --> 10:47.628
that are going on here.

10:47.658 --> 10:50.192
At the beginning, it was
fine before my wife moved in.

10:50.377 --> 10:53.195
And after she moved in,
everything just started

10:53.225 --> 10:55.686
getting weirder and weirder.

10:55.716 --> 10:56.971
Were you having any experiences

10:57.001 --> 10:58.939
before all this other
stuff started happening?

10:58.969 --> 11:00.919
A little bit. My grandma died.

11:01.038 --> 11:04.362
Every once in a while I'd
turn and I'd just see...

11:04.392 --> 11:05.674
I'd just see her standing there.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.931
I just chalked it up being that.

11:06.961 --> 11:08.332
I paid it no nevermind. Okay.

11:08.362 --> 11:10.212
And when did she pass?

11:10.468 --> 11:11.947
Two and a half years ago.

11:12.249 --> 11:13.562
Okay, did she live close by?

11:13.592 --> 11:15.284
My grandma lived right behind us.

11:15.369 --> 11:16.285
- She did?
- Yep.

11:16.387 --> 11:17.920
I got a picture of her.

11:21.592 --> 11:23.208
How old was she when she passed?

11:23.327 --> 11:24.415
- 89.
- Okay.

11:24.445 --> 11:26.562
Do you mind if I ask what she died of?

11:26.680 --> 11:28.219
- She hit her head on the sink.
- Okay.

11:28.249 --> 11:29.882
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.667
- Were you close with her?
- Yes, sir.

11:31.786 --> 11:34.019
Now, how often do you
think you see grandma?

11:34.121 --> 11:35.888
Almost every week. Really?

11:35.990 --> 11:38.524
Is she kind of, like, looking over you.

11:38.609 --> 11:40.359
I believe so.

11:45.132 --> 11:46.965
What the hell?

11:47.068 --> 11:53.138
The feeling I'm getting
is somebody with a cane.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.775
I think it's a female.

11:56.827 --> 11:58.727
Older female, maybe.

11:58.829 --> 12:02.498
And I'm getting something
weird with the head.

12:05.036 --> 12:07.369
Maybe it's stroke or something.

12:07.471 --> 12:11.106
She is often confused.

12:19.150 --> 12:21.022
So now, what about experiences
after your wife moved in,

12:21.052 --> 12:22.874
did you have anything happen?

12:22.904 --> 12:25.325
Yeah, one night I had a
picnic table in the back

12:25.355 --> 12:28.012
and I go out there at night and sit on it.

12:28.042 --> 12:30.715
And I just see all these
shadows coming in and out.

12:30.745 --> 12:31.849
What did they look like?

12:31.879 --> 12:33.184
Army men.

12:33.214 --> 12:36.754
Then I look over here
and I see, like, Indians.

12:36.784 --> 12:39.384
And look over here and cowboys.

12:39.470 --> 12:40.813
I mean, so you're seeing
all kinds of things.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.659
Yes, sir.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.177
I mean, were you drinking out there?

12:43.207 --> 12:45.424
- No, sir.
- Okay.

12:45.509 --> 12:47.993
I've never dealt with this before.

12:48.023 --> 12:51.836
I'm worried about them hurting
the kids and everything.

12:51.866 --> 12:53.699
I just want it gone.

13:03.811 --> 13:11.750
I do feel like there are
a lot of bodies... around.

13:14.421 --> 13:16.588
Somehow they're trapped with their bodies.

13:16.690 --> 13:21.109
They're able to reach
out and call for help.

13:24.064 --> 13:29.134
There's one specific guy who is dead.

13:29.236 --> 13:31.870
And he is old.

13:31.972 --> 13:34.373
He's around, like, 1900.

13:34.458 --> 13:37.376
And he was a tough, tough guy.

13:37.461 --> 13:40.251
He's bad off here, trapped.

13:40.281 --> 13:43.220
And he is, I think,

13:43.250 --> 13:46.557
the strongest one of these people,

13:46.587 --> 13:49.388
as far as reach... being able to reach out.

13:49.473 --> 13:51.423
He's, like, the main mummy.

13:59.366 --> 14:00.298
How old are you?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.438
10.

14:01.468 --> 14:03.774
I understand that you might
have seen a couple scary things

14:03.804 --> 14:05.042
in the house here.

14:05.072 --> 14:06.471
Can you tell me about one of them?

14:06.507 --> 14:10.381
Whenever I'm sitting in
the living room watching TV,

14:10.411 --> 14:12.583
I just see this person out
of the corner of my eye.

14:12.613 --> 14:14.919
It's a black figure.

14:14.949 --> 14:16.515
And then it glared at me.

14:16.617 --> 14:17.783
I looked at it.

14:17.865 --> 14:20.493
And then right when I
turned around, it went away.

14:20.523 --> 14:22.568
And how do you know it was glaring at you?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.436
I just saw the eyebrows go down.

14:24.466 --> 14:26.744
- Like that?
- Like that.

14:26.774 --> 14:28.941
So, what else scared you in the house?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.664
On the other side, in the dining room,

14:30.694 --> 14:32.194
there was a white figure.

14:32.224 --> 14:36.064
This one just came closer
to me and just stared at me.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.533
And I looked at it and it went away.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.085
Are you scared to stay here?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.386
Mm-hmm.

14:41.538 --> 14:43.372
So, there's a lot of beds in here.

14:43.474 --> 14:44.945
Where do you... where would you sleep?

14:44.975 --> 14:46.942
- This one.
- Up on top here?

14:47.027 --> 14:48.276
Okay.

14:48.362 --> 14:51.029
I just really don't like
sleeping in my bedroom alone.

14:51.115 --> 14:52.281
Okay.

14:56.954 --> 15:03.825
There's one person in
here who is being targeted

15:03.928 --> 15:07.362
by the dead that aren't able to rest.

15:07.464 --> 15:10.899
They are talking all the time

15:11.001 --> 15:13.919
to the person that's in the top bunk.

15:14.038 --> 15:17.673
It's too much for this person.

15:17.775 --> 15:20.442
It's a lot of information.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.344
What kind of information?

15:22.446 --> 15:28.784
This person is seeing
the old man from outside.

15:28.869 --> 15:34.339
Well, he's mummified, but
it's, like, a corpse screaming.

15:34.425 --> 15:39.594
Open mouth, kind of hanging,
crooked and emaciated.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.465
And he's, like, getting
in bed with the person.

15:44.090 --> 15:45.072
That creeped me out.

15:45.102 --> 15:46.298
I don't...

15:46.837 --> 15:50.205
That's some weird (bleep).

16:08.436 --> 16:10.444
First thing I do when
I start an investigation

16:10.474 --> 16:12.240
is pull the property deed.

16:12.342 --> 16:13.708
Turns out one family,

16:13.738 --> 16:16.728
the Stebers, owned the
property for over 53 years.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.352
And when I contacted a genealogist

16:18.382 --> 16:21.472
to look into it for me, she
said their time on the land

16:21.502 --> 16:23.735
was filled with death and heartbreak.

16:31.311 --> 16:33.600
Dr. Alexander, thanks
for helping with my case.

16:33.630 --> 16:34.913
I appreciate that.

16:34.943 --> 16:37.115
Now, what can you tell me
about the Steber family?

16:37.217 --> 16:40.118
In about 1867,

16:40.220 --> 16:43.888
Michael Steber came over from Bohemia,

16:43.918 --> 16:46.468
which is part of Czechoslovakia now.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.877
- Okay.
- He was 17 years old.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.895
Then he gets married.

16:50.998 --> 16:54.849
He marries Rosa in 1871.

16:56.906 --> 16:58.009
So, when did they wind up

16:58.039 --> 17:01.140
- on my client's property?
- ln 1892.

17:01.292 --> 17:03.247
All right, now, you mentioned tragedy.

17:03.277 --> 17:04.409
So, what happened?

17:04.511 --> 17:09.915
In 1895, Michael vanished.

17:10.017 --> 17:13.551
The family looked for him,
neighbors looked for him.

17:13.654 --> 17:18.194
He disappeared at the age of
45 and was never seen again.

17:18.224 --> 17:19.758
What about suspects?

17:19.843 --> 17:23.310
Well, there was one possible suspect.

17:23.430 --> 17:25.868
That was John Henry, his stepson.

17:25.898 --> 17:26.571
Why?

17:26.602 --> 17:30.001
Because he and his father
used to argue bitterly.

17:30.103 --> 17:31.975
Okay, but no body, so no
charges were ever brought up?

17:32.005 --> 17:34.728
No charges were ever brought against him.

17:34.758 --> 17:35.979
Okay, Michael is missing.

17:36.009 --> 17:38.115
He's never found. What
happens to the property?

17:38.145 --> 17:41.830
Well, in 1909, the land
is transferred to Rosa.

17:41.932 --> 17:44.766
She turns it over to her
son shortly thereafter.

17:44.852 --> 17:46.373
This is the stepson they thought
might have had something to do

17:46.403 --> 17:48.103
with his disappearance, right? Yes.

17:48.188 --> 17:49.738
What do I need to know about him?

17:49.823 --> 17:53.875
In 1926, he dies of stomach cancer.

17:53.911 --> 17:54.910
Who gets the property now?

17:54.995 --> 17:57.312
His son, George. How did it go for George?

17:57.397 --> 18:00.382
Not all that lucky for George.

18:00.467 --> 18:04.408
In 1940, George had a number of daughters,

18:04.438 --> 18:07.277
and three of them went
up to the swimming hole.

18:07.307 --> 18:07.996
Okay.

18:08.026 --> 18:12.733
And the youngest one,
Helen, went in swimming.

18:12.763 --> 18:15.363
And she started to struggle.

18:15.465 --> 18:20.919
The two oldest sisters
jumped in to help save her.

18:21.038 --> 18:22.571
Aw, look at that.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.601
Victims.

18:24.441 --> 18:27.275
Both of the older sisters died.

18:27.377 --> 18:30.345
Geez. What a shame.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.747
And here is the newspaper clipping.

18:35.385 --> 18:36.823
And that's where everybody swam.

18:36.853 --> 18:38.091
That was the big swimming hole.

18:38.121 --> 18:40.194
Okay, so, this can't be the
only drowning deaths there?

18:40.224 --> 18:42.029
I don't know if there are other drownings,

18:42.059 --> 18:44.298
but I do know in 1921

18:44.328 --> 18:48.179
there was a flood and
hundreds of people died.

18:53.537 --> 18:58.212
I'm hearing something
about a lake to my left,

18:58.242 --> 19:02.077
which is really weird,
considering where we are.

19:02.179 --> 19:04.145
Then I hear, "Cemetery."

19:04.248 --> 19:08.028
So, I'm thinking that there are bodies

19:08.058 --> 19:11.219
in or very near the water.

19:11.321 --> 19:13.622
And somehow they're mummified.

19:16.627 --> 19:18.799
And there were kids, little kids.

19:18.829 --> 19:21.735
Like, from 5 to 10, I would say.

19:21.765 --> 19:23.965
And they were singing
"Ring Around the Rosie."

19:24.101 --> 19:25.884
What the (bleep) was done to them?

19:28.623 --> 19:32.456
I can't figure out other
than it being some kind

19:32.486 --> 19:37.312
of pressure in the chest and upper back,

19:37.414 --> 19:40.231
like maybe drowning.

19:40.350 --> 19:41.850
Weird.

19:41.952 --> 19:43.451
What?

19:43.587 --> 19:47.422
I heard someone say,
"The children perished.

19:47.524 --> 19:49.291
It was bad."

19:52.429 --> 19:54.917
I've got to find out more
about this massive flood

19:54.947 --> 19:58.316
and how it might have
affected my client's property.

19:58.402 --> 20:00.018
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

20:00.137 --> 20:02.304
who said it was one of the
biggest natural disasters

20:02.389 --> 20:04.306
in the town's history.

20:12.883 --> 20:15.350
Randy, what can you
tell me about this flood?

20:15.452 --> 20:19.020
It actually started Friday
the 9th of September, 1921.

20:19.072 --> 20:20.522
It was caused by a tropical storm

20:20.552 --> 20:22.412
that had moved inland into Mexico

20:22.442 --> 20:24.409
and then moved north into Texas

20:24.494 --> 20:27.362
and just poured rain onto the county

20:27.447 --> 20:29.786
for a day and a half, two days.

20:29.816 --> 20:32.289
It dumped at least 38 inches of rain.

20:32.319 --> 20:34.048
The creeks rose by 40 feet.

20:34.078 --> 20:35.558
What are we talking, as far as devastation?

20:35.588 --> 20:36.297
What happened?

20:36.327 --> 20:38.478
You can see on some photos that we did find

20:38.508 --> 20:40.942
- some of the aftermath.
- Wow.

20:41.044 --> 20:43.528
Just from a few days after.

20:43.647 --> 20:47.515
The floor waters came in
at such a sudden surge,

20:47.601 --> 20:49.439
a lot of people had to cut their way out

20:49.469 --> 20:51.358
through the roof of their homes.

20:51.388 --> 20:54.689
Farm houses, livestock, people...

20:54.719 --> 20:56.863
Anything in its path was just swept away.

20:56.893 --> 20:58.760
So, there would have been
just pandemonium and panic?

20:58.938 --> 21:00.000
Correct.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.152
Now, I know that Brushy
Creek is like 500 feet

21:02.182 --> 21:03.236
from my client's property.

21:03.266 --> 21:05.122
So, that area had to get destroyed.

21:05.152 --> 21:07.702
Oh, absolutely.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.255
Statewide, of the bodies
that were recovered

21:10.340 --> 21:15.247
that we know of, there were 224
that perished in the flooding.

21:16.315 --> 21:18.669
Geez. So, how did it impact my property?

21:18.699 --> 21:20.365
How many people died in that area?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.618
- There were at least 93 bodies recovered.
- Wow.

21:23.704 --> 21:25.466
So, we're talking more
than a third of the bodies?

21:25.496 --> 21:26.239
Correct.

21:26.269 --> 21:28.406
The greatest concentration
of deaths did occur

21:28.508 --> 21:30.809
within that Williamson County area.

21:35.272 --> 21:37.816
Something about these bodies,

21:37.846 --> 21:41.352
they want the house to be torn down.

21:41.382 --> 21:43.688
I don't know why.

21:43.718 --> 21:45.491
How many bodies?

21:46.226 --> 21:48.026
There are quite a lot.

21:48.056 --> 21:52.187
At least 20 to 50 maybe.

21:52.654 --> 21:54.716
Do you know how they died?

21:54.746 --> 21:57.945
Something with that weird
pressure (bleep) and water.

21:57.975 --> 21:59.509
I don't (bleep) know.

21:59.539 --> 22:01.109
Okay.

22:01.139 --> 22:03.530
Most of them died badly.

22:23.183 --> 22:24.621
Now that I know the original owners

22:24.651 --> 22:26.023
of Sharon and J.D.'s property

22:26.053 --> 22:28.236
suffered from mysterious
death and heartbreak

22:28.266 --> 22:30.655
and that a flood killed dozens in the area,

22:30.685 --> 22:33.658
I need to know if there's anything else.

22:33.688 --> 22:35.816
Searching through old
records, I find an article

22:35.846 --> 22:38.413
about a young war vet named
George Williams who murdered

22:38.515 --> 22:41.449
a retired farmer right next
to my client's property.

22:43.372 --> 22:45.378
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police chief

22:45.408 --> 22:48.593
who's gonna tell me all
about this bizarre case.

22:53.714 --> 22:55.880
This homicide, what happened?

22:56.316 --> 23:00.819
May the 1st, 1959, we've
got two guys headed to work.

23:00.904 --> 23:03.669
Kelly Frederick picks up George Williams,

23:03.699 --> 23:05.012
who's a buddy of his.

23:05.042 --> 23:06.041
They work together.

23:06.071 --> 23:08.443
George Williams lived hand to mouth.

23:08.473 --> 23:10.517
Didn't have a car, couldn't
drive himself to work,

23:10.547 --> 23:12.781
had to depend on a friend to get him there.

23:12.811 --> 23:15.150
This morning though,
after he gets in the car,

23:15.180 --> 23:18.125
George Williams pulls a
pistol, a.32 caliber revolver,

23:18.462 --> 23:20.027
and forces Kelly Frederick

23:20.057 --> 23:22.524
to drive him to a little country road

23:22.554 --> 23:25.093
next to your client's property.

23:25.123 --> 23:27.062
And he says, "Get out of the car."

23:27.094 --> 23:29.166
So Kelly gets out of the car

23:29.196 --> 23:30.667
and George Williams steps out of the car

23:30.697 --> 23:32.831
and begins to shoot at him, unprovoked.

23:32.861 --> 23:34.488
Well, Kelly Frederick
figures, "The only way

23:34.518 --> 23:35.655
I'm getting out of this alive

23:35.685 --> 23:37.702
is to get back in the car and drive away."

23:37.732 --> 23:39.165
Okay, now, that's not the guy
that gets murdered, though.

23:39.195 --> 23:39.838
No.

23:39.868 --> 23:42.257
So, George Williams ducks off the road.

23:42.287 --> 23:44.909
He approaches a retired
farmer, Charlie Heise.

23:44.939 --> 23:46.161
67 years old,

23:46.191 --> 23:48.246
out having a little
fishing fun in the morning.

23:48.276 --> 23:50.187
"Need a ride to Austin."

23:50.217 --> 23:51.333
Heise says, "Where do you live?"

23:51.363 --> 23:52.250
He said, "Well, I live in Austin.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.558
That's why I need a ride down there."

23:54.588 --> 23:56.660
Heise doesn't respond quick enough.

23:56.690 --> 23:57.973
Williams pulls out his pistol,

23:58.003 --> 24:00.110
shoots him five times in the chest.

24:00.683 --> 24:02.299
So, George Williams takes the keys

24:02.329 --> 24:05.269
out of his pocket, goes up, steals the car,

24:05.299 --> 24:07.132
heads west to Austin.

24:07.217 --> 24:09.000
24 hours later, he's in custody.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.008
They immediately bring him back.

24:11.038 --> 24:13.076
And there's your picture
of George Williams.

24:13.106 --> 24:16.358
May the 3rd, he also
gives a full confession.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.389
In the confession, did
he say anything about,

24:18.419 --> 24:19.976
like, what his motivation was?

24:20.006 --> 24:21.148
Never said a word.

24:21.178 --> 24:23.429
I thought I read somewhere
that he was a vet.

24:23.459 --> 24:25.352
He was. He'd gone to the Korean war.

24:25.382 --> 24:27.736
He called nine witnesses in his trial.

24:27.936 --> 24:30.811
All nine witnesses said
when he came back from Korea,

24:31.213 --> 24:32.228
he was different.

24:32.258 --> 24:33.313
What happened with the trial?

24:33.343 --> 24:35.582
Well, he was found
guilty, sentenced to death.

24:35.612 --> 24:39.180
He was executed July the 8th, 1960.

24:41.134 --> 24:45.437
They take him in at 12:02
A.M. to the death chamber,

24:45.572 --> 24:48.073
shave his head, put a
wet sponge on his head,

24:48.141 --> 24:51.348
put a metal cap over the
top of that, strap it down.

24:51.378 --> 24:53.078
Put a rubber ball in his mouth,

24:53.163 --> 24:56.549
and they ran about 50,000
volts through his body.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.238
At 12:05, they threw the switch.

24:58.268 --> 25:01.976
At 12:09, he was pronounced
dead in the chair.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.728
And, of course, interestingly enough,

25:04.758 --> 25:08.498
his death certificate
says legal electrocution.

25:09.346 --> 25:11.001
Now, look at that.

25:11.798 --> 25:13.020
He was only 30.

25:13.050 --> 25:14.050
Right.

25:20.524 --> 25:24.542
This guy has got (bleep) issues.

25:24.644 --> 25:33.518
And he is good at holding
that information in tight.

25:33.548 --> 25:35.058
This dangerous sociopath

25:35.088 --> 25:38.022
is trying to block me from
seeing who he really is,

25:38.052 --> 25:41.793
but I'm starting to get some
clues about who he was in life.

25:41.895 --> 25:44.785
He's one of those people
that looks older than he was.

25:44.815 --> 25:46.281
And how old would you say he was?

25:46.311 --> 25:51.669
Late 20s, early 30s at the most.

25:51.772 --> 25:53.844
So, you know when he's from?

25:53.874 --> 25:55.723
He's recent.

25:55.842 --> 26:00.645
One thing is that he was
in financial ruin, I think,

26:00.747 --> 26:02.847
at the time of his death.

26:02.949 --> 26:06.317
There was something weird with his mouth

26:06.420 --> 26:08.019
and I can't place it.

26:08.121 --> 26:12.056
He's one of those people

26:12.086 --> 26:16.694
that would make you feel very
uncomfortable around them.

26:16.724 --> 26:20.704
He was really intense when he was alive.

26:20.734 --> 26:25.244
A very good actor of emotions, you know?

26:25.274 --> 26:27.706
Because he doesn't really have any.

26:27.808 --> 26:29.696
That's, I think, why he's still here.

26:29.726 --> 26:31.376
Like, he likes it.

26:31.478 --> 26:33.812
He doesn't have to pretend anymore,

26:33.842 --> 26:36.915
so he's got free rein.

26:43.740 --> 26:44.744
During my walk,

26:44.774 --> 26:48.476
I saw a sociopath terrorizing
women in the house.

26:48.506 --> 26:49.749
I'm meeting with this sketch artist

26:49.779 --> 26:52.413
to draw him as he appeared in life.

26:52.443 --> 26:55.655
His chin is kind of shorter than average,

26:55.685 --> 26:59.554
and his forehead is smaller than average.

26:59.656 --> 27:02.028
He's pretty buff.

27:02.058 --> 27:06.661
Very piercing, large, round eyes.

27:06.763 --> 27:08.796
Next, I described a disturbing scene

27:08.826 --> 27:10.770
I saw in a little boy's room.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.884
They kind of looked mummified.

27:12.914 --> 27:15.208
So, they're buried in the ground.

27:15.238 --> 27:17.744
A long, stretching arm and hand,

27:17.774 --> 27:21.559
like, coming from the corpse's head area

27:21.645 --> 27:24.679
to the kid in the bed.

27:29.177 --> 27:30.952
Is this what you saw?

27:33.506 --> 27:34.756
Yes.

27:52.948 --> 27:55.725
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:55.755 --> 27:56.904
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:56.934 --> 28:00.132
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

28:01.278 --> 28:03.044
Amy, I'd like you to meet J.D.

28:03.146 --> 28:06.481
He had this house custom
built back in 2006.

28:06.566 --> 28:09.072
Now, everything was pretty
quiet until he married Sharon

28:09.102 --> 28:12.587
here about two years ago when
she moved in with her kids.

28:12.672 --> 28:16.241
Now, we got a photo here
of the nuclear family.

28:16.326 --> 28:19.611
So, this is nick, her son who is 16.

28:19.729 --> 28:21.763
This is Mattie who is 14,

28:21.848 --> 28:26.000
and this is J.D.'s son, Jacob, who is 10.

28:26.102 --> 28:29.237
The activity really got amped
up about seven months ago?

28:29.339 --> 28:30.039
Right.

28:30.069 --> 28:32.531
And it turned violent.

28:33.059 --> 28:36.344
Now, things are so bad here that
Sharon doesn't sleep at night.

28:36.446 --> 28:39.213
She thinks the entire family
is in danger, and she's praying

28:39.316 --> 28:43.384
that we find a way to help
her get out of this hell.

28:43.486 --> 28:44.824
Did you have any...

28:44.854 --> 28:48.395
or your children have any
prior paranormal experiences

28:48.425 --> 28:49.629
before moving?

28:49.659 --> 28:51.392
Yes. Okay.

28:51.478 --> 28:53.761
When the children were small,

28:53.847 --> 28:56.603
we were about 45 minutes from here

28:56.633 --> 29:00.335
and we had experiences in that home.

29:00.420 --> 29:03.237
They've been dealing with
this their whole lives.

29:07.510 --> 29:09.065
When I got here,

29:09.095 --> 29:13.620
what I was seeing was
a large body of water,

29:13.650 --> 29:15.400
I'm assuming a lake.

29:15.485 --> 29:20.827
I was feeling this horrible pain,

29:20.857 --> 29:23.791
and it felt like pressure on my chest,

29:23.893 --> 29:26.149
feeling like it was being compressed.

29:26.179 --> 29:28.713
It was really bad.

29:28.954 --> 29:33.401
I also saw a lot of people.

29:33.503 --> 29:35.368
I would say there was
about 20 to 50 of them.

29:35.398 --> 29:43.678
And it seemed like they
were somehow mummified.

29:43.813 --> 29:47.782
These people, more than
likely, died pretty badly.

29:47.918 --> 29:50.068
And I was equating the water

29:50.186 --> 29:52.904
and the pressure with maybe drowning.

29:53.023 --> 29:55.478
Brushy Creek is literally
less than 500 feet

29:55.508 --> 29:57.697
from the property here.

29:57.727 --> 30:00.057
Now, back on September 9, 1921,

30:00.087 --> 30:01.334
you guys had a natural disaster here

30:01.364 --> 30:04.115
that was one of the biggest
in the county's history.

30:04.234 --> 30:06.106
This neighborhood was ground zero

30:06.136 --> 30:09.976
for a giant storm that came in.

30:10.006 --> 30:13.458
You had 38 inches of rainfall
in a matter of 24 hours.

30:13.577 --> 30:16.633
The creek levels rose up 40 feet.

30:16.805 --> 30:20.698
I got a couple of pictures
from when it happened.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.107
Wow.

30:22.137 --> 30:26.254
Now, statewide, they recovered 224 bodies.

30:26.356 --> 30:30.642
In this area alone,
they recovered 93 bodies.

30:30.727 --> 30:33.761
But the toll is probably
a lot higher than that.

30:36.866 --> 30:38.418
Now, you mentioned anxiety.

30:38.448 --> 30:39.603
You deal with anxiety on

30:39.633 --> 30:41.040
- a daily basis, right?
- Yeah.

30:41.070 --> 30:44.338
You can feel that
pressure push down on you.

30:44.368 --> 30:46.146
You feel that down on your chest,

30:46.176 --> 30:48.926
where you have to go
outside to get away from it.

30:52.615 --> 30:54.649
Okay, so what else did you
see on the walk-through?

30:56.686 --> 30:58.886
So, when I came in inside

30:59.055 --> 31:03.518
and I went to the bedroom
with the bunk beds, in there,

31:03.548 --> 31:06.199
the dead that are in the ground...

31:06.229 --> 31:10.064
you know, the mummified dead
are... mentally reaching out

31:10.150 --> 31:13.801
to someone very much specifically in there.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.803
She's talking about Jacob's room.

31:15.889 --> 31:18.723
There's this one guy, one
of the mummified people,

31:18.842 --> 31:22.910
and he is manifesting in the bedroom there.

31:22.996 --> 31:25.085
You're pretty sure he's,
like, probably a flood victim?

31:25.115 --> 31:28.266
Yeah, and I actually saw him

31:28.296 --> 31:31.157
standing in the bedroom
at the end of the bunk bed

31:31.187 --> 31:34.994
looking over to the person
that's in the top bunk,

31:35.024 --> 31:37.492
trying to communicate with that person.

31:39.796 --> 31:44.339
So, I saw this person, like,
seeing very brutal scenes.

31:45.147 --> 31:48.858
Blood and guts and, like,
pain and, like, suffering

31:48.888 --> 31:53.207
and all of this information
from all of these dead people.

31:53.293 --> 31:55.276
Jacob won't sleep in his bedroom,

31:55.361 --> 31:58.284
and he's the top bunk.

31:58.314 --> 32:00.353
He's like, "Dad, I don't want
to sleep in there no more.

32:00.383 --> 32:01.454
Something's not right.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.072
I just don't want to sleep in there."

32:03.102 --> 32:04.552
I think he's scared.

32:04.582 --> 32:05.789
Okay.

32:06.589 --> 32:11.058
Well, I had a sketch artist
do a sketch of what I saw.

32:15.469 --> 32:17.052
Oh, what the (bleep)?

32:20.019 --> 32:21.736
Are you kidding me?

32:23.990 --> 32:26.107
Now, look, it's gonna be
hard for you to see, but...

32:26.192 --> 32:27.909
Holy crap.

32:34.130 --> 32:36.334
Oh, my poor baby.

32:58.057 --> 33:00.258
It's not malicious.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.894
He just wants his message out there.

33:06.166 --> 33:08.731
As a father myself, I
would... Couldn't even imagine.

33:08.761 --> 33:09.905
Yeah.

33:09.935 --> 33:13.437
Tell me how to protect them.

33:13.540 --> 33:16.224
That does bring me to an individual

33:16.309 --> 33:19.110
who is in the house who is not good.

33:20.803 --> 33:24.170
This person is a younger male

33:24.200 --> 33:27.818
and he's absolutely a sociopath.

33:27.937 --> 33:31.489
He does make people feel
like they're being watched.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.975
I did get that he can be very physical

33:34.060 --> 33:36.277
with people in the house.

33:36.379 --> 33:39.146
And I got that he really
likes the purple bedroom.

33:39.282 --> 33:42.483
Mattie, her daughter, well, she got pushed.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.336
He is in there a lot.

33:45.455 --> 33:48.222
The thing that he was doing to me was...

33:48.252 --> 33:54.128
um... a burning sensation across my chest.

33:54.213 --> 33:56.364
And I did feel like this was happening

33:56.394 --> 34:00.751
or has happened to somebody in the house.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.837
I went into the master bedroom,

34:02.922 --> 34:06.674
and then I immediately got
the sensation of being choked.

34:06.704 --> 34:10.444
Um, and I felt like he wouldn't...

34:10.530 --> 34:14.041
this dead guy wouldn't let
go of the female in there.

34:14.071 --> 34:17.674
Oh. She just pretty much
described just about everything

34:17.704 --> 34:18.775
that you told me.

34:18.804 --> 34:20.905
- Yeah, one night in bed,
- Okay.

34:20.935 --> 34:26.210
I woke up to two hands
around my neck, strangling me.

34:26.599 --> 34:28.016
Now, you talked about the burning thing.

34:28.047 --> 34:29.786
Now, Sharon, you've been scratched.

34:29.815 --> 34:30.960
- It felt like a burning.
- Yes.

34:30.991 --> 34:33.417
- Yeah.
- It was just burn down the middle

34:33.520 --> 34:35.091
of my back, between my shoulder blades.

34:35.121 --> 34:38.494
And I was like, "Something
just scratched me. It burns."

34:38.524 --> 34:42.261
And it was just excruciating pain.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.284
She's also been inappropriately touched...

34:45.315 --> 34:46.759
- Yeah.
- You know, as well.

34:46.789 --> 34:49.717
Yeah, I can see this guy doing that.

34:49.917 --> 34:53.643
Woken up in the middle of
the night to a hand on me.

34:54.704 --> 34:56.980
And I'm just, like...
hugged up next to my husband

34:57.010 --> 34:58.197
and we'll just sit there and pray together.

34:58.227 --> 35:00.127
And you can't get it off of you.

35:00.229 --> 35:02.051
Is he some kind of a perv?

35:02.081 --> 35:05.602
Um, obviously, he's focused on the women.

35:06.744 --> 35:09.837
So, any idea who this
sociopath was when he was alive?

35:09.939 --> 35:12.406
I think he was really in his 20s or 30s,

35:12.492 --> 35:14.175
but he looked older.

35:14.277 --> 35:17.792
He's very quiet, very reserved,

35:17.822 --> 35:20.715
um, but I think he had
his moments where he would,

35:20.745 --> 35:26.087
like, lose it and kind of go crazy.

35:26.189 --> 35:29.595
He was in some type of financial ruin

35:29.625 --> 35:31.514
when he died and, also,

35:31.544 --> 35:33.433
there was something with his mouth.

35:33.463 --> 35:38.430
And I think it has something
directly to do with how he died.

35:39.219 --> 35:41.285
You said the guy was young,
in his late 20s, right?

35:41.371 --> 35:42.820
- Maybe early 30s.
- Mm-hmm.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.193
And a sociopath. Oh, yeah.

35:44.223 --> 35:45.995
There was a murder
connected to the property,

35:46.025 --> 35:47.838
but it was back in '59.

35:47.868 --> 35:49.043
There was a guy named George Williams

35:49.073 --> 35:50.277
who was a Korean War veteran.

35:50.307 --> 35:53.731
When he was 28 years old,
he worked as a laborer.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.689
And every day for two months
straight, this guy Williams

35:56.719 --> 35:59.120
would get picked up by
this guy Kelly Frederick

35:59.222 --> 36:01.055
to carpool to work.

36:01.124 --> 36:04.692
But on May 1st, 1959, he snapped.

36:04.827 --> 36:06.787
He had him pull over to
the side of the road here,

36:06.817 --> 36:10.865
right by your house and
pulled a.32 revolver on him.

36:10.950 --> 36:14.535
Kelly Frederick, he escapes
and he took off with the car.

36:14.620 --> 36:18.205
So, now this guy Williams
is walking around out here.

36:18.291 --> 36:22.493
And Brushy Creek, he sees this
poor guy Charlie Heise fishing.

36:22.523 --> 36:25.479
And he walks up to him and
says he needs a ride to Austin.

36:25.581 --> 36:28.871
But before poor Charlie had
a chance to respond to him,

36:28.901 --> 36:31.819
he put five bullets in
his chest and killed him.

36:31.954 --> 36:34.255
Williams is tried, convicted.

36:34.340 --> 36:35.456
Wow.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.976
By July 8th, 1960, he's electrocuted.

36:42.498 --> 36:44.877
I actually have his death certificate here.

36:44.907 --> 36:48.035
It was legal electrocution.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.553
But when she said it was
trouble with the mouth,

36:49.583 --> 36:52.373
I know they put the ball gag in there.

36:52.403 --> 36:55.042
They strap them down so they
don't bit their tongues off.

36:55.072 --> 36:57.933
Now, I was able to
track down his department

36:57.963 --> 36:59.029
of corrections photo.

36:59.059 --> 37:01.165
There's a chance this
could be the guy you saw?

37:03.981 --> 37:04.981
Nope.

37:06.686 --> 37:09.790
I did have a sketch done of the guy I saw.

37:16.816 --> 37:17.865
You're right.

37:17.967 --> 37:19.500
That's not him.

37:19.530 --> 37:20.668
Oh, my god.

37:20.753 --> 37:23.003
- But I've seen him before.
- Wait a minute.

37:23.033 --> 37:25.005
Is this the guy you see in your bedroom?

37:25.091 --> 37:26.300
Yes.

37:26.909 --> 37:29.369
This guy will stare at you.

37:31.224 --> 37:33.236
He'll sit back in the shadows.

37:33.266 --> 37:35.333
He sits back in the shadows.

37:38.202 --> 37:44.798
This person gets off on
watching and stalking,

37:44.828 --> 37:46.911
terrorizing the females.

37:47.086 --> 37:49.919
And, unfortunately, I think he
might have formed an attachment

37:49.949 --> 37:54.001
and followed you from a previous home.

37:54.087 --> 37:55.329
Wow.

37:57.824 --> 38:00.925
Sharon called us in desperation
because of what happened to her.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.282
The physical, the inappropriate touching.

38:03.312 --> 38:06.335
She was afraid it was gonna
possibly happen to Mattie next.

38:06.365 --> 38:09.200
Yeah, I'm worried about that, yeah.

38:09.285 --> 38:11.802
Because I think this
sociopath tagged Mattie

38:11.832 --> 38:14.171
when she was a child.

38:14.350 --> 38:16.624
When was her birthday? April.

38:16.742 --> 38:17.844
April.

38:19.062 --> 38:23.164
Which would be seven months ago.

38:23.354 --> 38:25.499
That's exactly when things
got bad for you guys.

38:25.585 --> 38:28.602
Yeah, that makes sense.

38:28.738 --> 38:32.556
She's at a particular point in her life

38:32.748 --> 38:37.383
that's very appealing to him.

38:37.413 --> 38:38.805
Mm-hmm.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.791
Sick. Sick.

38:59.606 --> 39:01.306
So, Sharon, you've been choked,

39:01.336 --> 39:04.242
scratched, inappropriately touched.

39:04.344 --> 39:06.878
Both your kids are living in fear.

39:06.963 --> 39:08.829
J.D., your house turned into a war zone.

39:08.859 --> 39:09.969
Yeah.

39:10.891 --> 39:12.583
But at least now we
know why it's happening.

39:12.967 --> 39:13.823
Right.

39:13.853 --> 39:15.358
The big question is,

39:15.388 --> 39:18.189
how do we fix it so we go back
to our happy and normal life?

39:18.593 --> 39:21.092
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to my partner, Amy.

39:23.107 --> 39:25.969
So, I think there's two main things

39:25.999 --> 39:27.771
that need to be dealt with.

39:27.801 --> 39:30.636
First is the dead people outside,

39:30.666 --> 39:34.411
because that is effecting your son.

39:34.591 --> 39:36.863
These dead people,
obviously, they need help

39:36.893 --> 39:38.898
and they need to be released.

39:38.928 --> 39:44.332
So, the best thing to
do is to bring in someone

39:44.417 --> 39:47.635
who is a psychic knower.

39:47.737 --> 39:49.871
Now, someone who has that ability

39:49.901 --> 39:53.480
can come in and really
assess what they are.

39:53.510 --> 39:54.675
Once they do that,

39:54.778 --> 39:58.179
they'll know exactly what
to do to move them on.

40:00.917 --> 40:01.949
All right, so, what about this jerk

40:02.051 --> 40:04.285
that's perving on everybody?

40:04.387 --> 40:07.422
Now, what I would like you to do for him

40:07.452 --> 40:11.648
is to find a demonologist.

40:11.678 --> 40:15.936
Because sociopaths, to me,
are demons in the flesh.

40:15.966 --> 40:20.635
These people that are
like this are not human.

40:20.874 --> 40:25.809
So, this demonologist will
come in and will do an exorcism

40:26.709 --> 40:28.516
to get rid of him.

40:32.906 --> 40:34.488
He's freaking out a little bit.

40:34.518 --> 40:39.387
So, it might take several sessions.

40:39.682 --> 40:43.708
In the meantime, this is black salt.

40:43.915 --> 40:46.416
So, what I want you to do
is every night before bed,

40:46.446 --> 40:49.947
you sprinkle this all
the way around each bed.

40:50.083 --> 40:54.221
That's what will keep
him from breaking through

40:54.251 --> 40:56.571
and physically attacking.

40:56.673 --> 40:59.891
Well, you look totally different
from the first time I met you.

40:59.959 --> 41:02.399
I feel at peace right now.

41:02.429 --> 41:03.666
There's, like, resolution.

41:03.696 --> 41:06.247
I mean, there's a solution.

41:06.332 --> 41:08.249
Whatever it takes to get everything

41:08.334 --> 41:11.169
out of the house and
take care of my family.

41:11.304 --> 41:12.720
I'm all for it.

41:12.750 --> 41:13.927
We can do this.

41:13.957 --> 41:15.206
We can do this.

41:15.308 --> 41:16.641
Nothing is gonna hurt my kids.

41:16.671 --> 41:18.609
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

41:18.639 --> 41:21.813
I really hope Sharon
and J.D. follow my advice

41:21.915 --> 41:24.932
and deal with the evil
surrounding their family.

41:25.018 --> 41:27.985
With the help of a psychic
knower and demonologist,

41:28.071 --> 41:30.960
they'll be able to free the
dead and banish the sociopath

41:30.990 --> 41:34.241
that's been terrorizing them for so long.
