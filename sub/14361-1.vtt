00:04.447 --> 00:06.547
<i>(Frankie) Back to school.</i>

00:06.835 --> 00:09.354
<i>Time to leave the carefree</i>
<i>memories of summer behind</i>

00:09.465 --> 00:11.280
<i>and buckle down for another year.</i>

00:11.371 --> 00:12.360
Here we go again.

00:12.457 --> 00:15.679
Ugh. Do we have to?
I'm not ready.

00:16.087 --> 00:17.349
Can't we go back to June,

00:17.482 --> 00:20.190
when the whole summer was
stretched out in front of us?

00:20.308 --> 00:22.403
(Scoffs) You got no memory
for pain, Frankie.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.091
You sure you wanna go back there?

00:24.365 --> 00:27.152
Well, we were very hopeful
when it started.

00:27.985 --> 00:30.057
(Birds chirping) _

00:31.755 --> 00:32.911
You smell that?

00:33.061 --> 00:35.178
I'm telling you, something's
dead in this car.

00:35.298 --> 00:36.212
It goes away in the winter,

00:36.305 --> 00:37.548
but it reactivates in the summer.

00:37.645 --> 00:40.505
No, no. The grass, Mike.
Fresh-cut grass.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.733
If it's fresh-cut,
you know it's not ours.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.535
Doesn't it just
take you back, though?

00:44.632 --> 00:45.829
That's it right there.

00:45.970 --> 00:48.048
You know, it's just that thing,

00:48.149 --> 00:50.953
that feeling of summer that
you can't describe,

00:51.054 --> 00:53.181
you know, "this."

00:53.980 --> 00:54.406
(Sighs)

00:54.492 --> 00:56.097
We should have
an amazing summer, Mike.

00:56.204 --> 00:57.712
Let's have an amazing summer.

00:57.809 --> 01:00.389
Yes, let's, my darling.
With our travel budget

01:00.490 --> 01:01.871
of whatever's in the couch cushions,

01:01.970 --> 01:03.298
the world is our oyster.

01:03.407 --> 01:05.519
Ugh. It's not just
about money, Mike.

01:05.656 --> 01:07.792
I mean, don't you remember
summer as a kid?

01:08.055 --> 01:10.347
Going to drive-in movies,
playing ghost in the graveyard

01:10.449 --> 01:12.100
till your folks called you inside?

01:12.196 --> 01:14.457
- Oh, yeah. That was a real summer.
- Yeah.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.465
I could kill a whole day

01:15.563 --> 01:17.352
just smacking a tennis ball
against the house

01:17.491 --> 01:22.329
and lying on my back,
in the yard, doing this...

01:23.365 --> 01:24.448
(Squeaks)

01:24.789 --> 01:26.786
Love that.
Still can't do that.

01:26.901 --> 01:29.670
Ah, it's not hard, Frankie.
It's all in the thumbs.

01:29.763 --> 01:31.207
You gotta use your thumbs.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.871
<i>Meanwhile, our kids were busy</i>

01:32.980 --> 01:35.119
<i>using their thumbs for other things.</i>

01:35.255 --> 01:37.117
(Cell phones and video game beeping)

01:37.464 --> 01:38.940
(Scoffs) Look at this.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.167
Unh-unh.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.738
Come on. Turn 'em off.
(Beeping stops)

01:41.851 --> 01:44.567
You're not spending your whole
summer staring at screens.

01:44.683 --> 01:46.048
(Axl, Brick, and Sue groan)

01:48.623 --> 01:49.426
(Turns TV on)

01:49.531 --> 01:51.781
<i>- (Man) I'm going in!</i>
- That goes for the TV, too.

01:51.907 --> 01:53.462
(Axl, Brick, and Sue groan)

01:54.786 --> 01:56.474
<i>Whoa! Careful!</i>

01:59.354 --> 02:00.693
Out.

02:00.818 --> 02:03.077
(Axl, Sue, and Brick groan)

02:03.911 --> 02:06.843
Well, I don't see any kids
zombied out all over my couch,

02:06.965 --> 02:08.625
so my talk must've done something.

02:08.728 --> 02:10.198
Well, don't get too excited.

02:10.279 --> 02:11.904
I just busted them huddled
in the garage,

02:11.999 --> 02:14.351
watching the old black and white
TV with the cracked screen.

02:14.447 --> 02:15.589
Are you serious?

02:15.685 --> 02:16.907
What is wrong with them?

02:17.012 --> 02:18.484
I-I told them to go outside.

02:18.624 --> 02:20.411
Oh, my gosh.
You told them something,

02:20.504 --> 02:23.183
and they didn't do it?
Maybe those weren't our kids.

02:24.457 --> 02:25.739
I don't get it.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.154
When I was a kid, I ate supper
with one foot on the floor.

02:28.252 --> 02:29.687
I couldn't wait to get outside.

02:29.951 --> 02:31.639
And I didn't even need any toys.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.522
All I needed was a stick and a rock.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.405
How do you think I got 'em
out of the garage?

02:35.534 --> 02:36.302
(Chuckles)

02:36.396 --> 02:38.037
They really are pathetic, Mike.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.257
All they care about is getting
100,000 coins

02:40.358 --> 02:42.429
for Farmville or Pac-Man

02:42.533 --> 02:43.947
or whatever it is they're playing.

02:44.116 --> 02:45.929
I'm pretty sure they're not
playing Pac-Man.

02:46.068 --> 02:48.390
Yeah, the point is,
Axl's gonna be a senior.

02:48.528 --> 02:51.072
This might be the last summer
we're all together as a family.

02:51.173 --> 02:53.172
I just don't want them
clicking it away.

02:53.322 --> 02:55.077
We have to reactivate them,

02:55.563 --> 02:58.008
kind of like that smelly
dead thing in the car.

03:00.085 --> 03:01.112
Ugh!

03:01.576 --> 03:02.939
This is so pointless.

03:03.081 --> 03:04.263
It's our summer.

03:04.365 --> 03:06.253
I mean, they're the ones forcing
us to go to school all year.

03:06.337 --> 03:07.524
This is our time to unwind

03:07.629 --> 03:10.373
howsoever and with whatsoever
we choose, right?

03:10.474 --> 03:13.989
Totalmundo. That's not a thing
people really say, is it?

03:14.119 --> 03:16.218
- No.
- Well, I might try to start it.

03:16.470 --> 03:19.447
I wouldn't. I know dad acted
like this was his idea,

03:19.551 --> 03:21.152
but this has mom written all over it.

03:21.279 --> 03:22.718
If they're all of a sudden
gonna start caring,

03:22.810 --> 03:24.599
I'd appreciate
a little heads-up.

03:24.656 --> 03:26.281
Brick, what are you doing?

03:26.402 --> 03:27.935
You didn't kill another pet, did you?

03:28.094 --> 03:30.037
No, I don't even have
a pet right now.

03:30.205 --> 03:31.645
Do I?

03:32.303 --> 03:33.641
I'm planting a tomato.

03:34.144 --> 03:35.177
That's weird.

03:35.289 --> 03:36.505
I found it in my backpack.

03:36.604 --> 03:38.758
- Oh, that's much more normal then.
- I must've left it in there

03:38.881 --> 03:40.891
from when we were learning
about photosynthesis.

03:40.992 --> 03:42.827
Ah! That sounds like
a school word, Brick.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.380
It's summer.
Leave the learning inside.

03:44.532 --> 03:46.067
(Front door opens and closes)

03:46.220 --> 03:48.275
Hey, guys. Your dad and I
were talking...

03:48.528 --> 03:50.121
Ugh! Why?

03:50.234 --> 03:53.349
(Sighs) And we've come up
with a fun summer thing

03:53.458 --> 03:54.713
for the whole family.

03:54.820 --> 03:55.586
Adoption?

03:55.690 --> 03:56.683
Just say the word.

03:56.848 --> 03:58.214
Look, we've been watching you three,

03:58.346 --> 04:00.420
and, uh, I gotta tell you, it's sad.

04:00.817 --> 04:02.230
We're sad for you.

04:02.821 --> 04:04.942
You got no clue
of what a fun summer is.

04:05.048 --> 04:08.881
And to that end, we are going to...

04:09.560 --> 04:10.579
a drive-in!

04:10.697 --> 04:11.903
- I get fries.
- No fair.

04:12.021 --> 04:12.909
You always call fries first

04:13.015 --> 04:15.222
- and them mom makes us share.
- I want my own fries!

04:15.341 --> 04:17.555
No, not a drive-thru,
you fools.

04:17.649 --> 04:20.086
We're talking about
a drive-in movie.

04:20.178 --> 04:21.450
Movie! They're letting us
watch a movie!

04:21.560 --> 04:24.073
No. Stop.
Nobody's going inside.

04:24.179 --> 04:26.282
Your mom and I are taking you
to a fun summer thing,

04:26.393 --> 04:27.475
and it's only 2 bucks a car,

04:27.585 --> 04:29.499
and it's called
a drive-in movie.

04:29.608 --> 04:31.154
(Gasps) Is that like the ride
at Disney World

04:31.269 --> 04:32.859
where you're actually in the movie?

04:32.967 --> 04:34.093
We're going to Disney World?!

04:34.198 --> 04:37.465
Nobody's going to Disney World.
Nobody's in the movie.

04:37.592 --> 04:41.851
Ugh. It's about giving
you people some... this.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.321
They have no appreciation
of "this."

04:44.414 --> 04:45.370
(Sue) I don't get it.

04:45.465 --> 04:46.919
Why would we drive somewhere
to watch a movie

04:46.927 --> 04:48.464
when we can just watch a movie here?

04:48.596 --> 04:50.774
I-I just don't understand
what we're doing.

04:50.903 --> 04:53.794
Yeah, I'm with Sue-pid. Sounds
like a waste of gas to me.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.371
Totalmundo.

04:55.488 --> 04:56.559
The car isn't moving.

04:56.665 --> 04:59.295
You're... you're... you're sitting
in, like, a parking lot.

04:59.662 --> 05:01.110
You're not making this sound fun.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.985
So we're not allowed
to watch a movie here,

05:03.102 --> 05:04.799
but we can watch one outside?

05:04.910 --> 05:06.748
Do you guys get this?
I-I don't get it.

05:06.850 --> 05:10.079
There's nothing to get.
Your dad and I were talking...

05:10.183 --> 05:11.788
- I told you this was all her.
- It's not all me!

05:11.929 --> 05:14.881
Your dad and I had
an insane idea <i>together</i>

05:15.002 --> 05:16.318
that we could all do something

05:16.424 --> 05:18.356
that we thought
was fun when we were younger.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.859
Oh, no. Here it comes.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.774
More tales of life on the prairie.

05:21.894 --> 05:23.635
Fine. You win.
We'll play tennis.

05:23.747 --> 05:25.201
And I'll stay here with my tomato.

05:25.380 --> 05:27.153
(Whispers) To-mah-to.

05:27.270 --> 05:30.021
Nobody stays. Everybody,
put on your shoes and let's go.

05:30.128 --> 05:31.794
Or you could put on your PJs.

05:31.963 --> 05:33.375
(Axl, Sue, and Brick) What?

05:33.471 --> 05:34.768
'Cause you'll be in the car.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.281
I don't get it.
Why are we still in the car?

05:38.366 --> 05:40.400
- I thought we nixed that.
- What are we even talking about?

05:40.508 --> 05:42.007
I'm really, really confused.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.232
Okay.

05:43.964 --> 05:48.709
Imagine a giant iPhone
that you can drive up to.

05:50.493 --> 05:51.656
I'm listening.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.781
Ooh! Check this out.

06:15.105 --> 06:16.376
Yeah. Hi. I'll have
a large fries and...

06:16.377 --> 06:17.446
Axl.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.665
Let him order. He'll figure it
out soon enough.

06:19.782 --> 06:21.645
Look at this, you guys.

06:21.762 --> 06:23.921
It's a triple feature...
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"

06:24.034 --> 06:26.285
"Fiddler on the Roof,"
and "Serpico."

06:26.996 --> 06:28.589
Mm. 2 bucks a car.
It makes sense.

06:28.762 --> 06:30.807
I've never even heard of
any of those movies.

06:30.922 --> 06:33.058
You never said they were
gonna be <i>old</i> movies.

06:33.174 --> 06:35.001
They're not old.
They're classic.

06:35.101 --> 06:36.463
"Classic" is code
for "lame."

06:36.624 --> 06:37.609
I mean, how could it not be?

06:37.715 --> 06:39.206
The first one has "chitty"
right in the title.

06:39.218 --> 06:41.519
Oh, look! There's a playground
up there.

06:41.639 --> 06:43.714
And after you play on that,
when the movie starts,

06:43.813 --> 06:44.876
you come back to the car.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.586
If I leave the car,
I'm never coming back.

06:46.694 --> 06:48.872
Hey, look. The couple in the car
next to us are wrestling.

06:49.015 --> 06:49.860
Oh.

06:49.925 --> 06:52.291
Hey! Family night!
(Honks horn)

06:52.927 --> 06:54.790
Axl, switch with me.
I can't see behind dad.

06:54.899 --> 06:55.899
Pfft.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.398
Axl, I think you're gonna
really like "Serpico."

06:57.417 --> 06:58.724
It's got Pacino in it.
Remember the coach

06:58.738 --> 07:00.946
- from "Any Given Sunday"?
- Oh, yeah? Cool.

07:01.098 --> 07:02.993
Great football movie.
Oh, hey, that reminds me.

07:03.093 --> 07:04.754
The, uh, scout from Southern
called again.

07:04.879 --> 07:06.796
I think he knows
another school's after you.

07:06.910 --> 07:09.022
- Axl, switch with me.
- It's tough to pick.

07:09.142 --> 07:10.970
I mean, East Indiana's
got hotter chicks,

07:11.102 --> 07:12.888
but Southern's are supposed to
be sluttier, so...

07:13.004 --> 07:14.409
(Honks horn) Family night.

07:14.525 --> 07:16.187
Dad, can you duck down
when the movie starts?

07:16.270 --> 07:17.393
Hang on. You know, Axl,

07:17.498 --> 07:19.998
maybe we can visit both campuses
again later in the summer.

07:20.104 --> 07:20.577
Dad.

07:20.578 --> 07:22.468
I still can't believe we're
choosing between two schools.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.579
(Laughs) I know, for Axl.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.291
Dad, I am not gonna be able
to see when I'm behind you.

07:25.299 --> 07:26.939
(Frankie, Axl, Brick, and Mike
talking at same time)

07:27.034 --> 07:27.976
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

07:28.073 --> 07:29.881
(Axl) Guys, I'm trying to
listen to what they're saying.

07:29.882 --> 07:30.589
Axl, switch with me!

07:30.618 --> 07:31.884
Get your freak leg
off of me, sue! God!

07:31.885 --> 07:33.149
Dad's not listening to me! What...

07:33.259 --> 07:34.903
Okay, guys. Hey, guys.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

07:35.028 --> 07:36.447
Hey! Why don't you all go
to the swing set?

07:36.563 --> 07:38.035
Uh, 'cause I'm not 6.

07:38.138 --> 07:39.328
Not a suggestion.

07:39.596 --> 07:40.585
- Ugh!
- Go.

07:40.684 --> 07:41.784
Come on.

07:42.611 --> 07:45.515
<i>(Music playing over speaker)</i>

07:45.677 --> 07:46.789

07:47.042 --> 07:49.483
Why do I feel like this was
more fun when we were kids?

07:49.616 --> 07:51.671
Because when we were kids
we didn't have kids?

07:51.761 --> 07:52.765
Ah.

07:55.492 --> 07:57.463
(Squeaking)

08:03.009 --> 08:04.709
Axl, do I have anything on my butt?

08:04.887 --> 08:05.760
No, you're good.

08:08.034 --> 08:09.394
God, this is lame.

08:09.506 --> 08:11.756
Every year, they go through
some kind of midlife crisis.

08:11.869 --> 08:13.963
Thank God their lives are
more than halfway over.

08:14.107 --> 08:16.450
By the way, nice job getting us
kicked out of the car, Sue.

08:16.584 --> 08:19.841
It wasn't my fault. I was trying
to get dad to listen to me,

08:19.954 --> 08:23.746
but he only wanted to hear you
go on and on about football.

08:23.854 --> 08:25.412
Well, that's 'cause I'm his favorite.

08:26.059 --> 08:29.212
What? You are not
dad's favorite, Axl.

08:29.331 --> 08:30.527
(Chuckles) Okay.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.472
Nobody is anybody's favorite.

08:33.573 --> 08:35.518
Parents don't have favorite kids.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.784
Sure they do. Everybody's got
a favorite everything.

08:37.924 --> 08:39.222
- What's your favorite fruit?
- Banana.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.488
- Favorite group?
- One Direction.

08:40.605 --> 08:41.907
- Favorite movie?
- "Fiddler on the Roof."

08:41.938 --> 08:42.832
You haven't seen it yet.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.410
Yeah, but I have a really good
feeling about it.

08:45.099 --> 08:47.140
See? You think parents
don't have a favorite kid?

08:47.282 --> 08:48.982
Everybody has a favorite everything,

08:49.092 --> 08:51.408
and in this family,
the favorite kid is me.

08:51.612 --> 08:54.449
(Scoffs) Ha. That's hilarious.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.534
Why would <i>you</i> be their favorite?

08:56.635 --> 08:59.477
You cause them so much stress,
you get bad grades,

08:59.586 --> 09:01.428
you do dumb things with your friends.

09:01.567 --> 09:04.595
There is no way
you're they're <i>favorite.</i>

09:04.728 --> 09:06.838
Oh! There <i>is</i> way!

09:07.099 --> 09:08.382
I'm their firstborn.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.112
I was born when they still
had love to give.

09:10.228 --> 09:11.518
Well, actually, I'm the baby,

09:11.616 --> 09:13.194
so I'm pretty sure I'm the favorite.

09:13.304 --> 09:16.186
You're a loser who misses
a tomato. I win.

09:16.436 --> 09:19.336
Believe what you want,
but in every book, every movie,

09:19.441 --> 09:21.364
the baby is always the favorite.

09:21.708 --> 09:23.102
Not when he's an accident.

09:23.266 --> 09:25.102
That is not true. Sue!

09:25.227 --> 09:27.371
They called you "Oops"
till you were 3.

09:27.562 --> 09:30.633
Look, there is two of you,
and I am the only girl.

09:30.743 --> 09:32.479
Everyone knows girls are easier.

09:32.596 --> 09:34.525
I am so, so nice.

09:34.653 --> 09:36.740
I think it's pretty clear
who the favorite would be

09:36.847 --> 09:39.142
if they had a favorite,
which they don't.

09:39.249 --> 09:41.331
Sue, think about it.

09:41.431 --> 09:43.772
What do you really contribute
to this family?

09:44.012 --> 09:46.200
I mean, Oops is freakishly smart,

09:46.334 --> 09:48.604
I got recruiters all wanting
a piece of the ax,

09:48.715 --> 09:52.910
and hmm, what has Sue Sue Heck
really brought to the party?

09:53.043 --> 09:55.337
Nothing but the huge rust stain
on her butt.

09:55.590 --> 09:56.970
Axl!

09:57.741 --> 09:59.523
Look, clearly, you two
didn't fulfill them,

09:59.639 --> 10:00.795
and they were forced to keep going

10:00.896 --> 10:02.892
until they got what
they wanted... moi.

10:03.014 --> 10:05.252
You don't know anything.
Neither of you.

10:05.346 --> 10:07.295
Parents don't have favorite kids!

10:07.402 --> 10:09.396
I'm sorry! They just don't!

10:09.976 --> 10:11.159
Least favorite says "what."

10:11.263 --> 10:12.182
What?

10:12.297 --> 10:13.475
(Laughs)

10:13.713 --> 10:14.619
See, it's funny

10:14.724 --> 10:16.481
because he said
"least favorite says 'what, '"

10:16.583 --> 10:18.393
and then you repeated "what" and...

10:18.497 --> 10:20.483
Don't nerd up my joke, Brick.
Just let it lie.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.222
- (Sighs) This is nice, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.312 --> 10:29.421

10:30.984 --> 10:32.144
(Mouth full) I don't know.

10:32.823 --> 10:34.074
Let's worry about
why we don't do it more

10:34.200 --> 10:36.350

Okay?

10:36.793 --> 10:37.862
Good plan.

10:39.408 --> 10:41.523
Okay, I get the seat behind mom.

- Mm.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.143
How can you tell?
Is that the sound?

10:56.272 --> 10:58.328
It's so crackly. Oh, my God.
I can barely hear it.

10:58.452 --> 10:59.930
- Turn it up. Up! Up! Up!
- Okay.

11:00.046 --> 11:01.382
I think I missed the beginning.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.794
The credits are my favorite part.

11:02.922 --> 11:04.530
Can someone rewind it?

11:04.852 --> 11:07.834

civilization up close, isn't it?

11:08.132 --> 11:09.702
Do you guys have favorite kids?

11:09.991 --> 11:12.124
Mm. I like those Donahues.

11:12.461 --> 11:15.093
No, of us.
Mom, I really want to know this.

do you guys have favorites?

11:20.441 --> 11:21.899
Honey, don't be ridiculous.

11:22.054 --> 11:24.897
Parents love all their kids
infinitely.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.904
If there's infinite love,
then it's not possible to love

11:28.035 --> 11:31.179
one more than the other, because
infinite love is infinite.

11:33.169 --> 11:34.470
(Mouth full) Guess I'd say Axl.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.053
- (Gasps) Dad!
- Mike!

11:36.165 --> 11:37.462
What?

11:37.663 --> 11:38.564
Well, no, sure,

11:38.667 --> 11:40.566
the infinite stuff your mom said...

11:41.443 --> 11:43.226
Yeah, but, I mean, if I had to pick,

I'm just saying,
East Indiana State is closer.

You gotta consider that.

We still don't know how much
they're gonna play you,

12:55.567 --> 12:56.843
(Mouth full) I don't want
to be closer.

12:56.937 --> 12:58.974
I wanna be as far away
from you people as possible.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.429
It's like when Tevye decided
his town was too small,

13:02.537 --> 13:04.728
so he went on the flying car
to New York to become a cop.

13:06.322 --> 13:08.172
You do know that's
three separate movies?

13:09.255 --> 13:11.049
Dad, I know you're aware

13:11.181 --> 13:13.330
that since the incident
at the drive-in,

13:13.443 --> 13:15.424
I've kinda been freezing you out.

13:15.666 --> 13:16.884
Mm-hmm?

13:17.132 --> 13:18.831
I guess I just sorta felt
like Serpico

13:18.948 --> 13:20.875
when his toymaker friend
betrayed him,

13:20.986 --> 13:22.922
you know, before the pogrom guys
burned down the wedding.

13:23.057 --> 13:24.582
Again, three separate movies.

13:24.732 --> 13:27.614
My point is, I think I was
blaming you, but I realized

13:27.730 --> 13:30.122
I have to shoulder
the responsibility as well.

13:30.330 --> 13:33.475
Of course it would make sense
that Axl would be your favorite.

13:33.592 --> 13:35.642
You spend more time with him,
and he's a boy and everything,

13:35.767 --> 13:37.121
and I've gotta own that.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.396
Sue, he's not my favorite.
It's just a dumb thing I said.

13:40.504 --> 13:43.667
Owning it. But it's not enough
just to own it.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.278
I have to fix it,

13:46.397 --> 13:48.879
and that's why I'm hereby
declaring this

13:49.709 --> 13:52.195
the summer of Sue and dad!

13:53.039 --> 13:54.285
Wow!

13:54.394 --> 13:56.147
That's a... big book.

13:56.242 --> 13:59.110
Yes, it is, and you and I are
gonna fill every single page

of our summer together.

14:02.190 --> 14:03.508

14:19.373 --> 14:22.346
<i>Mike realized that more and more.</i>

14:24.046 --> 14:24.595

14:24.695 --> 14:26.668
B-L-U-E. Pick a number.

14:26.802 --> 14:29.134
- Three.
- One, two, three. Pick a higher number.

14:29.249 --> 14:30.730
- Four.
- One, two, three, four.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.207
So then Spencer came back
and was like,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.015
"are you guys going
to the pool?"

14:34.122 --> 14:35.830
and carly thinks
he was asking her out,

14:35.938 --> 14:38.089
but he did say "guys,"
so I'm not sure.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.216
What do you think, dad?

14:39.329 --> 14:41.670
Brad's at tap camp, so I really
need a man's opinion.

14:41.872 --> 14:43.882
Uh...

14:44.596 --> 14:46.459
It's called pass the candle,

14:46.571 --> 14:48.661
and it's a really cool
trust exercise.

14:48.773 --> 14:51.399
We do it at slumber parties
all the time.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.234
I just shared with you

14:53.522 --> 14:55.733
that I don't really like
the feel of sticky tape.

14:56.052 --> 14:59.998
Now it's your turn to share
something with me.

15:02.446 --> 15:03.812

15:03.927 --> 15:05.970
Wait.

15:06.288 --> 15:07.493
Yes.

15:07.897 --> 15:08.955

15:12.987 --> 15:15.225

15:37.715 --> 15:41.169
It turns our your favorite son
failed a class.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.964
- What?
- Well, I can explain.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.333
All right,
the first half of the year,

15:44.338 --> 15:45.516
I didn't even know I was taking it.

15:45.629 --> 15:46.904
I thought I had a free period,

15:47.025 --> 15:49.545
then everyone was too far ahead,
and I was totally lost.

15:49.697 --> 15:50.985
In <i>English?</i>

15:51.088 --> 15:52.579
That shouldn't even be a requirement.

15:52.943 --> 15:54.370
I've been speaking it,
like, half my life.

15:54.481 --> 15:56.072
How long were you planning
on hiding this from us?

15:56.207 --> 15:57.926
I swear, I was gonna tell you
right after

15:58.030 --> 16:00.762
I did something good,
but nothing good happened, so...

16:00.776 --> 16:02.027
If you're gonna sit around this house

16:02.028 --> 16:03.127
waiting for good things to happen,

16:03.232 --> 16:05.096
you got a long wait, mister.

16:05.986 --> 16:07.152
What's going on?

16:07.296 --> 16:09.249
Is Axl in some kind of trouble?

16:09.366 --> 16:12.135
Uh, yeah, your brother may not
be going to college.

16:12.246 --> 16:14.998
Chillax. I got, like,
two schools fighting over me.

16:15.204 --> 16:17.600
Not if you don't finish
high school, you don't.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.021
You know, my report card was
quite good.

16:20.144 --> 16:22.018
I could maybe tack it up here
on the fridge

16:22.136 --> 16:23.889
for you to peruse at your leisure.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.548
It's not that big of a deal.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.737
It's one class.
I can just take it next year.

16:28.033 --> 16:31.454
No, you can't. You've got
a full course load as it is.

16:31.571 --> 16:32.608

16:32.720 --> 16:34.248

16:34.369 --> 16:35.577

16:35.700 --> 16:37.831
to see if I can even get you
into summer school!

16:37.932 --> 16:40.369
No! No school in summer.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.171
Those things together are
an oxymoron.

16:42.271 --> 16:43.568
Whoa.
I think I used it right.

16:43.662 --> 16:45.031
See? I know this stuff.

16:45.132 --> 16:46.416
The passing grade is
just a formality.

16:46.510 --> 16:47.821
Please. Don't make me go
to summer school.

16:47.855 --> 16:49.413
What about
the... the... the... the "this"?

16:49.534 --> 16:51.134
Huh? You said that was
very important.

16:51.237 --> 16:53.033
I'll go outside right now
and hit tennis balls.

16:53.169 --> 16:56.680
Since <i>I</i> got good grades,
I could go do that.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.635
Dad, care to join me?

16:59.466 --> 17:00.811
(Camera shutter clicks)

17:01.515 --> 17:04.647
Okay, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

17:04.934 --> 17:07.553
You are going to go to summer school,

17:07.657 --> 17:10.083
and you are going to excel,
or I am gonna reach under

17:10.183 --> 17:13.421
that bed of yours and choke you
with whatever else I find there!

17:13.499 --> 17:15.663
God. That's so typical.

17:15.797 --> 17:16.973
You just focus on the one bad thing

17:17.082 --> 17:19.262
and completely ignore
all the C's and D's.

17:20.253 --> 17:21.483
(Sighs)

17:28.512 --> 17:31.628
Oh, my God. Summer school's
even lamer than real school.

17:31.881 --> 17:34.464
Now they expect me to memorize
a dumb raven poems

17:34.577 --> 17:36.242
that barely even rhyme.
I mean, I could write

17:36.349 --> 17:38.746
a billion times better one
than this right now.

17:39.682 --> 17:42.191
Summer blows. Away it goes.

17:42.307 --> 17:43.489
It's totally sucky...

17:43.612 --> 17:46.274
Something that rhymes
with "sucky."

17:46.591 --> 17:48.422
I think Poe can rest easy
another day.

17:48.778 --> 17:51.300
This is good, guys.
We got here early.

17:51.407 --> 17:53.196
We staked out a really good spot.

17:53.310 --> 17:56.843
Ooh! Yeah, baby!
I love me some fireworks!

17:56.987 --> 17:58.727
Nothing says summer like fireworks.

17:58.852 --> 18:00.473
Still in there swingin', huh, pally?

18:00.603 --> 18:01.885
- Mm-hmm.
- Gotta hand it to us.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.562
A lesser family would've given up.

18:03.745 --> 18:05.685
<i>Is</i> there a lesser family?

18:06.630 --> 18:08.211
Ugh.
There's barely anyone here.

18:08.403 --> 18:10.336
That's because everybody
with lesser parents

18:10.431 --> 18:12.888
are in their houses,
glued to their screens,

18:13.020 --> 18:15.861
and we are having a nice picnic.

18:15.992 --> 18:17.094
Who's got the blue bag?

18:17.480 --> 18:19.293
(Mike, Sue, Axl, and Brick)
You forgot the blue bag?

18:19.396 --> 18:21.518
No, I absolutely did not forget
the blue bag.

18:21.641 --> 18:23.166
I pulled it out of the trunk.

18:27.262 --> 18:29.194
Relax. I probably set it
next to the car.

18:29.284 --> 18:30.711
I'll just go back and get it.

18:31.031 --> 18:32.728
Dad, I made up a bunch of questions

18:32.824 --> 18:33.941
for us to ask each other.

18:34.061 --> 18:36.921
I call it "the summer
of Sue and dad survey,"

18:37.040 --> 18:39.967
which when abbreviated
spells "so sad," but it's not.

18:40.082 --> 18:42.150
It's the opposite of that.
It's happy.

18:42.686 --> 18:43.380
Mm.

18:43.944 --> 18:45.149
How long is this gonna last?

18:45.349 --> 18:47.707
Your daughter loving you?
I don't know.

18:48.543 --> 18:50.404
Okay, question one...

18:50.998 --> 18:54.476
Which character on "Glee" do you
most identify with and why?

18:54.829 --> 18:56.805
Dad, wanna go toss a football around?

18:56.932 --> 18:59.914
Yes.
I think better when I move.

19:00.044 --> 19:00.638
Ooh.

19:00.729 --> 19:02.891
All right, dad, going wide!

19:03.674 --> 19:04.383
(Mike) Good catch!

19:04.459 --> 19:06.014
You're trying way too hard
with dad, Sue.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.289
It's getting embarrassing.

19:07.406 --> 19:09.365
Uh... (Scoffs) I think
the collage I made

19:09.492 --> 19:11.983
of us making collages
would beg to differ.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.552
I have made a lot of good headway.

19:14.799 --> 19:15.891
Found it.

19:16.410 --> 19:18.976
A few things fell out,
but this chicken is good.

19:19.124 --> 19:19.875
Mmm.

19:19.971 --> 19:21.414
So you're not dad's favorite.

19:21.598 --> 19:23.545
Move on.
I've made peace with it.

19:23.719 --> 19:24.614
(Mouth full) Oh, come on.

19:24.717 --> 19:26.225
Are you guys still
talking about this?

19:26.380 --> 19:29.906
Look, your dad says stuff,
he doesn't think,

19:30.011 --> 19:32.307
there's no favorites,
he loves you all the same.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.626
(Mike) How about this kid?
That's my boy!

19:35.085 --> 19:37.724
Axl, get off of dad's shoulders.
It's time to eat.

19:37.815 --> 19:39.369
(Axl) - All right! Whoo!
(Mike) - Great pass!

19:39.520 --> 19:41.504
Mmm. Triangle watermelon.

19:41.890 --> 19:42.836
My favorite.

19:43.174 --> 19:46.824
See? What'd I tell you? Fruit,
kids, parents, everything.

19:47.036 --> 19:48.200
Parents?

19:48.485 --> 19:50.885
Hells, yeah, parents.
I got favorites.

19:50.998 --> 19:53.892
Like, in terms of you two,
hands down, dad's my favorite.

19:54.054 --> 19:56.102
Axl, we shouldn't do this.

19:56.221 --> 19:58.345
It only ends up
hurting people's feelings.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.165
It's okay, Sue.
I have pretty thick skin.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.228
I mean, of course Axl's gonna
say dad's his favorite.

20:02.340 --> 20:03.386
Dad picked him.

20:03.497 --> 20:04.695
They're in cahoots.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.376
I'm not in cahoots with anyone.

20:06.494 --> 20:09.075
(Scoffs) This is a silly
discussion to even be having.

20:09.196 --> 20:11.873
Everyone has their own opinions.
Right, guys?

20:12.831 --> 20:14.662
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.702
No. Go on, Brick.

20:16.814 --> 20:17.918
I think we're all very interested

20:18.026 --> 20:19.141
in what you have to say.

20:19.239 --> 20:20.831
Look, you have a lot of things
in your favor.

20:20.948 --> 20:22.300
I'm not saying it wasn't
a tough call,

20:22.415 --> 20:23.851
but I gotta go dad.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.499
Dad?

20:25.787 --> 20:27.317
This guy right here?

20:27.436 --> 20:29.009
You're the one that nags them.
That's all.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.399
That's the only reason
they're picking me.

20:30.402 --> 20:32.402
This is you defending me?
The nag defense?

20:32.749 --> 20:34.256
You do nag us a lot.

20:34.356 --> 20:35.222
(Sue) No, you guys.

20:35.325 --> 20:37.579
Stop.
You can't just discount mom.

20:37.692 --> 20:38.941
Mom is there for us.

20:39.059 --> 20:41.032
She does a lot of things for us.

20:41.159 --> 20:42.405
Yeah...

20:42.539 --> 20:44.581
Think about it.
How much does she really do?

20:44.750 --> 20:46.225
I mean, she doesn't cook us
that much food.

20:46.334 --> 20:47.984
Then again, do we really want her to?

20:48.086 --> 20:49.545
This chicken's pretty rank.

20:49.905 --> 20:51.047
(Mouth full) I like it.

20:51.135 --> 20:52.131
That is true.

20:52.231 --> 20:54.087
Your after-school
pickup record's a little spotty.

20:54.192 --> 20:55.405
She's not the most reliable.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.917
She did leave me
at wrestlerette practice

20:57.012 --> 20:59.217
so late the janitor went home
and my hair froze.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.731
It was one time.
I fell asleep.

21:01.843 --> 21:02.789
Come on. You were going

21:02.900 --> 21:04.590
in the right direction
there before, Sue.

21:04.694 --> 21:06.528
Just stand up for yourself
and your beliefs.

21:06.634 --> 21:08.673
Yeah, just say it, Sue.
Who's your favorite?

21:08.787 --> 21:10.687
I am not gonna do this.
I am not gonna participate

21:10.791 --> 21:13.118
in anything that's just gonna
end up hurting mom's feelings.

21:13.221 --> 21:14.290
(Gasps)

21:15.455 --> 21:16.590
I'm sorry, mom.

21:16.707 --> 21:18.230
I am so, so sorry.

21:18.385 --> 21:21.760
It's just that it's
the summer of Sue and <i>dad.</i>

21:22.174 --> 21:23.356
Wow.

21:23.974 --> 21:26.075
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.

21:26.316 --> 21:27.974
So you're not their favorite parent.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.021
You're a solid second place.

21:30.866 --> 21:33.023
- Eh.
- Eh?

21:33.136 --> 21:35.497
Mrs. Donahue sends Sean with
extra cookies for my lunch.

21:35.613 --> 21:36.676
Hang on. This is wrong.

21:36.802 --> 21:38.571
None of us are being fair
to mom here.

21:38.728 --> 21:40.581
Maybe if you made your case.

21:40.919 --> 21:44.108
Oh, please.
I am not gonna make my case.

21:45.072 --> 21:46.212
(Mouth full) Okay, fine.

21:46.404 --> 21:49.540
First of all, I'm the one that
does all things kid-related.

21:49.673 --> 21:51.034
I sign all your permission slips,

21:51.151 --> 21:52.679
I run out and get you poster board,

21:52.802 --> 21:55.492
I clean that cesspool
you call a backpack.

21:55.623 --> 21:56.391
Frankie, don't do this.

21:56.484 --> 21:58.117
Oh, I'm doing it.
Do you know

21:58.218 --> 22:01.088
all three of your heads
were unnaturally large,

22:01.215 --> 22:03.228
thanks to your giant
favorite parent over here's

22:03.326 --> 22:04.655
weird genetic quirk?

22:04.762 --> 22:07.675
And that after 27 months
of carrying you people around,

22:07.788 --> 22:10.404
I can no longer sneeze or laugh
or jump in the bouncy house

22:10.526 --> 22:11.992
without peeing?

22:12.192 --> 22:13.512
They don't really need to know that.

22:13.610 --> 22:15.024
Okay. What about tonight?

22:15.165 --> 22:16.542
Who's the one
that got us out of the house,

22:16.695 --> 22:19.157
that packed the blue bag
full of tasty chicken,

22:19.260 --> 22:21.416
and searched the newspapers
for the best park

22:21.543 --> 22:23.420
with the best view
of the best fireworks,

22:23.519 --> 22:27.056
all so we could create one
stinking memory of <i>"this"?</i>

22:27.161 --> 22:29.810
Well, if anybody's
still confused, it was me.

22:30.055 --> 22:31.405
Me, me, me.

22:31.508 --> 22:34.418
So just lie down, stop talking,
and start watching,

22:34.531 --> 22:38.102
because nothing says summer
like fireworks!

22:45.175 --> 22:48.727
(Fireworks explode in distance)

22:48.843 --> 22:51.991
Nobody... say...
anything.

23:01.279 --> 23:02.848
<i>As July turned into August,</i>

23:02.973 --> 23:04.230
<i>the only healthy relationship</i>

23:04.323 --> 23:07.064
<i>left in the house</i>
<i>was Brick and his tomato.</i>

23:07.890 --> 23:10.839
<i>It grew so big he needed</i>
<i>to find support for it.</i>

23:11.866 --> 23:12.901
(Frankie) Brick!

23:13.017 --> 23:15.180
<i>And then he found other support</i>
<i>for it.</i>

23:16.078 --> 23:17.204
(Sue) Brick!

23:18.834 --> 23:20.884
<i>I'd like to say we were</i>
<i>making the same progress</i>

23:20.985 --> 23:22.383
<i>on our summer...</i>
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

23:22.469 --> 23:24.552
<i>But I wasn't throwing in</i>
<i>the towel just yet.</i>

23:24.677 --> 23:27.745
Guys, come on.
It's a beautiful day out there,

23:27.868 --> 23:30.656
and I'm about to show you
some real fun.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.230
Guess what I used to do
when I was a kid.

23:32.361 --> 23:33.921
Ride dinosaurs?

23:34.125 --> 23:36.198
Yes, 'cause I'm a billion years old.

23:36.328 --> 23:38.048
Come on. You're gonna love it.

23:38.995 --> 23:40.326
(All groan)

23:42.586 --> 23:43.854
Ta-da!

23:44.480 --> 23:46.122
What are we supposed to do?

23:46.302 --> 23:47.614
Run through it.

23:48.264 --> 23:49.241
Why?

23:49.362 --> 23:50.551
Because it's fun.

23:50.682 --> 23:52.010
Come on. I'll show you.

23:52.710 --> 23:53.969
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

23:55.094 --> 23:56.472
What do you do now?

23:56.627 --> 23:58.146
You run through it again, like...

23:58.266 --> 24:02.521
Whoa! Whoa! It's cold,
but exhilarating.

24:02.761 --> 24:04.012
I don't get it.

24:04.137 --> 24:05.047
- Please stop.
- Me neither.

24:05.056 --> 24:06.916
No, try it.
Listen if your clothes get wet,

24:07.030 --> 24:09.454
I won't freak out on you
like your dad would.

24:09.611 --> 24:11.810
Come on.
It's... it's spontaneous.

24:11.911 --> 24:13.245
Just... Whoo!

24:13.339 --> 24:14.725
You can go slow

24:15.022 --> 24:17.165
or you can go fast. Aah!

24:17.877 --> 24:19.329
Skip...

24:21.366 --> 24:22.857
You can go backwards.

24:23.635 --> 24:24.885
Whoo! Ooh.

24:24.977 --> 24:26.804
You can pretend like you're
leaping into another dimension.

24:32.464 --> 24:33.328
Oh, sure.

24:33.423 --> 24:35.910
If your dad suggested it,
you would do it.

24:36.179 --> 24:38.848
Well, I'm not playing
this popularity contest.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.565
Yeah, I'm not.

24:40.719 --> 24:41.482
You know, Brick,

24:41.572 --> 24:43.732
I always thought you and I
had a special bond. Hmm?

24:43.925 --> 24:46.922
Mother and son...
no stronger bond on earth.

24:47.031 --> 24:49.487
Really? I thought you believed
in infinite love.

24:49.908 --> 24:51.676
Well, yes,

24:51.886 --> 24:54.298
infinite love
while also understanding

24:54.456 --> 24:57.895
that you might have a special
connection to one person

24:58.069 --> 25:01.705
or parent more than the other.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.046
And here's the thing.
I know you probably felt

25:04.151 --> 25:05.964
the pressure to say dad was
your favorite

25:06.083 --> 25:08.738
'cause that's the way the whole
family seemed to be leaning,

25:08.860 --> 25:10.410
but honestly,

25:10.543 --> 25:13.069
I think it takes real character

25:13.188 --> 25:16.238
to speak out and express
your own feelings,

25:16.375 --> 25:19.442
and I think that you have
that kind of character.

25:20.650 --> 25:21.945
Mom, you're better than this.

25:22.047 --> 25:23.967
I'm not, though, Brick.
I'm really not.

25:24.059 --> 25:26.480
This is killing me. How could
you pick dad over me?

25:26.590 --> 25:28.100
He says it's okay if my socks
don't match.

25:28.196 --> 25:29.958
But it's not! Because people
will think you're weird,

25:30.094 --> 25:33.371
and I'm only telling you that
'cause I love you more than dad.

25:33.591 --> 25:34.807
It's 'cause he's tall.

25:34.912 --> 25:36.815
People love tall people.
I've seen the studies.

25:36.924 --> 25:38.239
Look, to be honest,

25:38.336 --> 25:40.673
I think the fireworks thing
really set you back.

25:40.824 --> 25:43.771
I mean, you literally robbed us
of fire in the sky.

25:43.962 --> 25:45.835
Plus, we all got sick
from your chicken.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.808
That was a month ago. What,
are you guys keeping score?

25:48.939 --> 25:51.292
32 to 10. And if it was up
to Axl and Sue,

25:51.409 --> 25:52.749
you'd only have 4 points.

25:52.869 --> 25:54.068
(Sighs)

25:56.913 --> 25:58.626
- Brick, does dad know you're...
- Oh, don't worry.

25:58.756 --> 26:01.018
They're not dad's. I found them
on the playground.

26:02.963 --> 26:04.195
(Sighs)

26:04.612 --> 26:05.655
All right.

26:07.626 --> 26:10.563
So, uh, listen,
just off the top of my head,

26:10.734 --> 26:12.870
you know, totally unrelated
to this discussion,

26:13.186 --> 26:14.676
summer's almost over.

26:14.896 --> 26:16.045
So if there's anything,

26:16.185 --> 26:19.140
anything at all
that you wanted to do,

26:20.126 --> 26:22.820
I'd certainly do my best
to try and make it happen.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.316
Really?

26:24.437 --> 26:25.740
Well, actually,

26:25.931 --> 26:28.178
I read that the River County fair is

26:28.285 --> 26:29.934
having a big tomato contest.

26:30.138 --> 26:31.513
The winner gets a trophy

26:31.634 --> 26:33.724
and a shout-out
on the River Soil web site.

26:33.868 --> 26:37.189
Ugh. Brick,
it's three hours away.

26:37.577 --> 26:39.393
It'll probably get you 20 points.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.718
(Sighs) Fine.

26:43.194 --> 26:44.582
(Gasps) Dad, so glad you're home.

26:44.718 --> 26:46.499
I got markers, stencils, and jewels,

26:46.602 --> 26:48.174
and I thought we could
each make a page

26:48.273 --> 26:50.104
for the "summer of Sue and dad" book,

26:50.204 --> 26:51.878
but we don't know
what the other is doing,

26:51.971 --> 26:53.647
and then we dedicate 'em
to each other.

26:53.754 --> 26:56.582
Hang on, Sue.
Axl, what are you doing?

26:56.899 --> 26:58.835
I am pen face.

26:59.088 --> 27:00.007
(Laughs)

27:00.137 --> 27:01.847
Well, be book face
and start studying.

27:01.945 --> 27:03.591
You got a lot of material
to cover by Friday.

27:03.684 --> 27:06.326
Uh, how many times have <i>you</i>
taken eleventh grade English?

27:06.411 --> 27:07.455
'Cause I've taken it twice now,

27:07.593 --> 27:09.800
so I think I know
a little bit more than you.

27:09.923 --> 27:11.476
Dad, glitter glue or sharpie markers?

27:11.626 --> 27:13.140
Oh, is that so? Okay.

27:13.244 --> 27:14.380
Let's take a little quiz.

27:14.754 --> 27:16.539
In the first act
of "Death of a Salesman,"

27:16.699 --> 27:18.000
which character...

27:18.104 --> 27:19.528
Death.

27:19.901 --> 27:23.146
(Sighs) Death isn't even
a character, Axl.

27:24.364 --> 27:25.324
That's fine.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.527
I guess we'll just sit here
and go over this together.

27:27.939 --> 27:30.302
<i>And it was at that moment,</i>
<i>Sue realized...</i>

27:30.421 --> 27:32.933
<i>Attention didn't have to be positive,</i>

27:33.674 --> 27:34.949
<i>and maybe negative attention</i>

27:35.094 --> 27:37.435
<i>was better than no attention at all.</i>

27:37.971 --> 27:41.169
<i>So Sue set out to explore</i>
<i>her dark side.</i>

27:41.605 --> 27:43.510
<i>Well, dark for Sue.</i>

27:43.927 --> 27:45.456
<i>She used Mike's razor...</i>

27:45.602 --> 27:46.662
(Gasps) Ah!

27:47.861 --> 27:49.603
Not using a coaster.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.149
Nope. Hot day, too.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.636
Whatevs.

27:56.825 --> 27:58.712
<i>She didn't wind up the hose...</i>

28:04.198 --> 28:05.766
<i>And worst of all...</i>

28:05.889 --> 28:07.909
Going to bed without my headgear,

28:08.059 --> 28:09.227
even though the orthodontist

28:09.319 --> 28:11.257
totally recommends
I wear it at night.

28:12.751 --> 28:15.180
But I don't care. Whatevs.

28:17.407 --> 28:19.778
<i>So as we headed into</i>
<i>the final few days of summer,</i>

28:20.000 --> 28:22.164
<i>we were all frustrated,</i>

28:22.279 --> 28:24.932
<i>but we had one more chance</i>
<i>to salvage the summer...</i>

28:25.024 --> 28:26.556
<i>the River County fair.</i>

28:27.218 --> 28:29.892
(Thump) Hey, gentle
on the bumps, please.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.711
I can't believe this. I finally
finish my last English paper

28:32.837 --> 28:34.844
while we're pumping gas,
and instead of taking me out

28:34.953 --> 28:36.093
or buying me a reward,

28:36.192 --> 28:39.462
I'm stuck chauffeuring a tomato
to a loser fest.

28:39.584 --> 28:40.682
This is a big deal.

28:40.794 --> 28:42.893
There was a whole write-up
about last year's.

28:43.009 --> 28:44.251
Listen to this...

28:44.922 --> 28:48.271
"As gawkers lined past
the table full of tomatoes,

28:48.423 --> 28:49.879
they were heard to exclaim,

28:50.010 --> 28:52.772
'well, I never saw anything
like this, '

28:52.935 --> 28:56.131
and 'I think this one's
gonna be a winner.'"

28:56.244 --> 28:57.269
Aah!

28:57.378 --> 28:58.816
Axl, come on.

28:58.966 --> 29:01.078
This could be our last summer
together as a family.

29:01.227 --> 29:02.750
Don't you want to get some of "this"

29:02.872 --> 29:04.882
before you're out there
dealing with all that?

29:04.982 --> 29:06.610
Oh, my God.
Isn't "this" over yet?

29:06.762 --> 29:08.526
It's not this. It's "this."

29:08.617 --> 29:10.986
Well, I want to do this, this, and...

29:11.126 --> 29:12.690
(Imitates gunshot) This.

29:13.718 --> 29:16.555
You know, dad, I'm not surprised
you wanted to drive together

29:16.658 --> 29:18.676
so you could talk to me alone.

29:20.274 --> 29:22.652
What are you talking about?
I had to stop at work first,

29:22.769 --> 29:24.448
and you said
you wanted to come with me.

29:24.824 --> 29:27.720
I get it.
I've been out of control.

29:28.364 --> 29:31.151
I'm sure you're very
disappointed in my behavior.

29:31.959 --> 29:34.890
Well, you've been sort of
annoying with that scrapbook.

29:35.012 --> 29:36.471
No, it's good you're intervening now,

29:36.578 --> 29:38.124
'cause I am at a crucial point
in my life

29:38.240 --> 29:39.924
where I could go either way.

29:46.081 --> 29:47.034
♪ Do-do-do-do ♪

29:47.136 --> 29:49.253
♪ do-do-do-do ♪

29:53.268 --> 29:54.051
I mean,

29:54.185 --> 29:55.375
I stopped taking my multivitamins,

29:55.479 --> 29:57.326
so I don't know
where that's gonna lead.

29:57.489 --> 30:00.179
Yep. Probably got a lot
of attention headed my way,

30:00.300 --> 30:02.449
and not the good kind.

30:05.661 --> 30:06.466
<i>(Cheering on radio)</i>

30:06.614 --> 30:08.254
I've done some bad things, dad.

30:08.372 --> 30:09.452
Bad things.

30:09.550 --> 30:10.815
Yesterday I was at a health fair,

30:10.921 --> 30:12.458
and there was a booth
with a basket of chapstick,

30:12.475 --> 30:13.276
and I took one.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.075
Maybe they weren't even free.

30:15.224 --> 30:16.515
I don't know.

30:16.629 --> 30:18.984
They could've been for sale,
and I just shoplifted.

30:19.113 --> 30:20.248
Whatevs.

30:21.016 --> 30:22.223
Oh, God. Oh!

30:25.883 --> 30:28.316
I think I'm gonna throw up.

30:28.496 --> 30:30.964
You didn't eat the ham sandwich
that was in that towel, did you?

30:31.182 --> 30:32.573
I'm just nervous.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.967
I heard there's out-of-towners
from Des Moines coming in,

30:35.092 --> 30:37.028
and they had above-average
rainfall this year.

30:37.225 --> 30:39.302
Axl, let us out.
I gotta give Brick some air.

30:39.403 --> 30:41.149
Just park the car and meet us
at the funnel cake stand.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.871
Don't say "funnel cake."

30:43.297 --> 30:44.739
(Whispers) Funnel cake.

30:45.709 --> 30:46.502
Oh.

30:47.783 --> 30:49.151
You here for the demolition derby?

30:49.472 --> 30:51.029
Uh, yeah. Sure.

30:51.139 --> 30:53.094
Okay. This way.

30:53.482 --> 30:55.253
(Engine idling)

31:05.876 --> 31:09.181
What the...
Hey! Get back here!

31:09.358 --> 31:10.746
(Car engine revs)

31:11.793 --> 31:12.917
Are you kidding me?

31:13.923 --> 31:15.741
This is the worst parking lot ever.

31:16.090 --> 31:17.936
I'm gonna need your insurance card!

31:23.114 --> 31:24.825
<i>(Man over PA)</i>
<i>Who's gonna win this time?</i>

31:25.000 --> 31:26.195
<i>(Speaks indistinctly)</i>

31:29.629 --> 31:31.363
<i>Number 11...</i>
<i>(Speaks indistinctly)</i>

31:33.095 --> 31:35.585
<i>(Carnival music playing)</i>

31:40.921 --> 31:44.185
This worked out just the way
you wanted, didn't it, Axl?

31:44.336 --> 31:45.802
You saw that he was a champion,

31:45.929 --> 31:47.696
and you couldn't take
that somebody else

31:47.813 --> 31:49.440
was gonna get the glory.

31:49.688 --> 31:52.361
You are a small, small, petty man.

31:52.468 --> 31:54.345
God, Brick, it was an accident!
What about my car?

31:54.455 --> 31:56.700
Who drives a car into
a demolition derby by mistake?

31:56.792 --> 31:57.957
At least I placed fourth.

31:58.062 --> 31:59.840
If it wasn't for sergeant
smashup, I would've medaled.

31:59.943 --> 32:01.401
Listen, everybody,
just take a breath.

32:01.506 --> 32:02.544
This is nothing we can't work out

32:02.660 --> 32:04.326
over a couple
of fried snickers, okay?

32:04.431 --> 32:06.260
Last Sunday, in church,
when the priest told us

32:06.368 --> 32:08.652
to pray for the poor, you know,
I-I prayed for the rich.

32:08.785 --> 32:10.961
That's just the way my brain is
working these days.

32:11.153 --> 32:15.171
I cannot believe that you would
do something so moronic.

32:15.282 --> 32:16.527
As I said, we could all use a minute.

32:16.621 --> 32:18.915
Let's just get a fried pie,
a couple fried marshmallows.

32:19.021 --> 32:21.070
There's a fried butter stand
right in there. Come on.

32:21.178 --> 32:22.529
Oh. The car.

32:22.986 --> 32:24.461
Axl, I said we're not
talking about...

32:24.557 --> 32:27.105
No, my paper's in that car!
My final paper I need to turn in

32:27.218 --> 32:29.123
to pass
my stupid summer school class!

32:29.700 --> 32:31.303
- Damn it, Axl!
- Axl, are you kidding?!

32:31.455 --> 32:33.245
I ate unwashed fruit!

32:33.364 --> 32:34.090
(Frankie) Wait!

32:34.182 --> 32:35.386
Well, I'm not helping.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.543
Hey! Wait!

32:36.619 --> 32:37.956
No, I'm not gonna help go get it,

32:38.049 --> 32:39.134
even if somebody asks me...

32:39.983 --> 32:41.368
- Stop! Come back!
- (Frankie) Wait!

32:41.495 --> 32:42.534
To.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.877
<i>As Sue watched the family take off,</i>

32:46.075 --> 32:48.607
<i>she realized that whether</i>
<i>she joined us or not,</i>

32:49.094 --> 32:50.518
<i>no one would notice.</i>

32:51.062 --> 32:53.855
<i>The only way she was gonna</i>
<i>get our attention was to...</i>

32:54.242 --> 32:55.707
<i>disappear.</i>

33:08.859 --> 33:11.616
<i>So Sue walked the midway</i>
<i>for what seemed like forever,</i>

33:12.821 --> 33:14.405
<i>trying to get lost,</i>

33:15.102 --> 33:16.867
<i>but hoping to be found.</i>

33:24.988 --> 33:26.120
Hi.

33:26.249 --> 33:27.649
Uh, my name is Sue Heck.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.795
Has anyone tried to find me yet?

33:30.247 --> 33:32.602
No. I don't think so.

33:32.945 --> 33:34.115
Are you lost?

33:34.233 --> 33:35.712
Well, no, not yet.

33:36.050 --> 33:37.649
But probably soon.

33:39.675 --> 33:41.440
I'll just wait over here.

33:49.052 --> 33:51.580
(Laughter and cheering in distance)

33:53.209 --> 33:56.100
So if someone was trying to find me,

33:56.427 --> 33:58.960
<i>this</i> is where'd they come.
Correct?

33:59.560 --> 34:00.962
Yes.

34:01.096 --> 34:02.625
Okay.

34:10.045 --> 34:11.922
Are you here
'cause you're in trouble?

34:12.070 --> 34:13.243
Oh. No. No, no, no, no.

34:13.362 --> 34:14.755
I-I'm a nice girl. (Chuckles)

34:14.913 --> 34:16.976
Oh. See?

34:17.693 --> 34:19.197
<i>(Carnival music plays in distance)</i>

34:23.953 --> 34:26.784
You know, it's a really crowded fair,

34:26.893 --> 34:28.417
so sometimes it takes them a while

34:28.521 --> 34:30.100
to notice you're missing.

34:30.907 --> 34:31.543
(Door opens)

34:31.659 --> 34:33.210
Oscar, thank God!

34:33.395 --> 34:35.817
Oh. That was the longest
four minutes of our lives.

34:35.917 --> 34:37.750
We don't know what we would've
done without you.

34:37.853 --> 34:39.712
Never do that to us again.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.668
All right. Let's get
some ice cream. (Chuckles)

34:53.143 --> 34:55.130
It's ringing. (Chuckles)

34:56.594 --> 34:59.379
If you guys are home,
um, this is Sue,

34:59.538 --> 35:03.110
and I'm still at the fair, so...

35:03.238 --> 35:05.273
(Mike) Hi. We lost something
very important.

35:05.438 --> 35:07.015
Our son's English paper.

35:07.130 --> 35:08.934
It was in one of the cars
they hauled away to the dump.

35:09.045 --> 35:10.690
We tried to chase it down,
but we couldn't catch it,

35:10.705 --> 35:12.322
and then we went
to the demolition derby arena,

35:12.437 --> 35:13.533
but they told us to come here.

35:13.647 --> 35:16.663
I need that paper. I can't take
junior English a third time.

35:16.792 --> 35:18.077
I just can't.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.762
I'm just an hourly hire.
Sorry.

35:21.097 --> 35:22.785
(Sighs)

35:24.403 --> 35:26.626
Sue, we're all tired
from running around,

35:26.743 --> 35:28.799
but this is no time to sit.
Let's go.

35:35.651 --> 35:38.089
<i>With Axl's car demolished,</i>
<i>his paper gone,</i>

35:38.226 --> 35:41.280
<i>Brick's tomato squashed,</i>
<i>and Sue in a dark place,</i>

35:41.422 --> 35:43.828
<i>the end of summer was a bust.</i>

35:44.191 --> 35:45.770
<i>There weren't enough foods on a stick</i>

35:45.882 --> 35:47.513
<i>to turn this thing around.</i>

35:48.038 --> 35:50.250
- Anybody wanna check out the fun house?
- No.

35:50.487 --> 35:51.823
4-H beef show?

35:51.950 --> 35:52.875
No.

35:52.983 --> 35:54.971
The cheesy side dish judging contest?

35:55.086 --> 35:56.245
No.

35:56.524 --> 35:59.815
Frankie, can we just pull
the rip cord on this thing?

35:59.952 --> 36:02.124
Let's just admit that
our amazing summer was a bust

36:02.251 --> 36:04.964
and hope fall is
a little kinder to us.

36:04.979 --> 36:06.593
I was at lost and found,
and no one knew I was gone.

36:06.594 --> 36:07.807
I just wanna go home.

36:07.912 --> 36:10.743
Fine. I was just trying
'cause that's what you wanted.

36:10.856 --> 36:13.238
If you're done, I'm done.
Let's just go to the car.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.254
- (Frankie) Really?
- I don't believe this.

36:38.379 --> 36:40.039
I always remember where I park.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.401
I hope you guys are
deducting points for this.

36:42.522 --> 36:44.967
I think it was near a white van.
Sue, do you remember?

36:45.178 --> 36:47.282
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

36:47.397 --> 36:49.985
I'm tired and emotionally
drained. Where's the car?

36:50.095 --> 36:53.509
I don't know. Sue was talking
a lot when we parked.

36:53.710 --> 36:54.961
Nice going, dad.

36:55.428 --> 36:56.882
Oh, yeah? Really?

36:56.988 --> 36:59.219
Well, at least I got a car
to drive home in.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.489
Oh, ho, like you've never
accidentally driven your car

37:01.591 --> 37:03.474
into a demolition derby before.

37:03.577 --> 37:05.350
No. You know what, Axl?
I haven't.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.215
God, you've been so grumpy all day.

37:07.330 --> 37:10.102
- Gee. I wonder if there's a reason why.
- I don't know what you want me to say.

37:10.227 --> 37:11.600
I'll save up for a new car.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.431
This isn't about the car,
Axl. This is about you.

37:14.592 --> 37:16.400
<i>Of course</i> it is.

37:16.511 --> 37:18.259
Do you realize that if you
would've gotten hurt,

37:18.376 --> 37:20.725
you could've kissed your
football scholarship good-bye?

37:20.914 --> 37:22.788
You gotta start being smart.

37:22.923 --> 37:24.391
I try, but it's not that easy.

37:24.515 --> 37:26.203
Well, I'm tired of being smart
<i>for</i> you.

37:26.310 --> 37:28.469
This is your entire future here,
and you're playing games

37:28.586 --> 37:30.632
with your report card
and almost getting killed.

37:30.748 --> 37:33.572
You're 18. It's time for you
to start doing the thinking.

37:33.725 --> 37:36.085
I always think I'm very responsible.

37:36.208 --> 37:38.429
You don't know how lucky you are
to have a scholarship.

37:38.829 --> 37:41.050
I'd have killed to play ball
in college.

37:41.167 --> 37:44.301
He doesn't care. He has no
respect for people or produce.

37:44.410 --> 37:46.526
Oh, that was not my fault.
All right, you blame mom

37:46.629 --> 37:48.107
for dragging us here
in the first place.

37:48.221 --> 37:49.927
Hey, me, your nonfavorite,

37:50.024 --> 37:52.404
was fine with you watching TV
all summer.

37:52.505 --> 37:54.490
He's the one that wanted you off it.

37:54.601 --> 37:56.143
I would've preferred TV
to coming here.

37:56.269 --> 37:58.472
Oh, you're the one
that wanted "this."

37:58.577 --> 38:00.145
I was just trying to give it to you.

38:00.264 --> 38:03.379
Oh, no. No, this has nothing
to do with "this."

38:03.497 --> 38:04.951
The only reason we're here is

38:05.076 --> 38:06.809
'cause you wanted
to suck up to Brick.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.279
That's right. I know
all about the 20 points.

38:09.448 --> 38:11.327
Well, I'm done with summer.

38:11.475 --> 38:14.776
But this was supposed to be
the summer of Sue and dad!

38:14.881 --> 38:16.882
Sue! Enough already.

38:16.982 --> 38:19.064
I love you, damn it.
I shouldn't have to say it.

38:19.238 --> 38:20.363
(Camera shutter clicks)

38:22.555 --> 38:25.500
(Explosions)

38:26.421 --> 38:28.640
(Crowd cheering)

38:30.931 --> 38:35.101
<i>So it turnout it's impossible</i>
<i>to stay mad during fireworks.</i>

38:35.220 --> 38:36.421
<i>You just can't.</i>

38:36.540 --> 38:38.776
<i>It's literally fire in the sky.</i>

38:38.876 --> 38:40.394
- (Sue) Oh!
- Oh!

38:41.207 --> 38:42.631
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

38:43.461 --> 38:46.573
- Oh, that's pretty.
- The pinwheel ones... I love those.

38:46.686 --> 38:47.564
Me, too.

38:47.697 --> 38:49.011
- Oh!
- Oh!

38:50.740 --> 38:53.521
<i>The thing is, you can't force</i>
<i>a great summer.</i>

38:54.732 --> 38:56.706
<i>It just happens.</i>

38:59.906 --> 39:01.540
Wait. I think I got it.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.149
(Blows air)

39:03.374 --> 39:04.926
Make sure your thumbs are right.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.383
It's all in the thumbs.

39:06.946 --> 39:07.725
(Squeaks)

39:07.834 --> 39:09.133
- Hey.
- Epic.

39:09.246 --> 39:10.458
(Laughs)

39:18.460 --> 39:20.534
<i>I gotta say, of all our summers,</i>

39:20.709 --> 39:23.410
<i>that one might've ended up</i>
<i>being my favorite.</i>

39:23.555 --> 39:25.486
<i>Not that I have any favorites.</i>
