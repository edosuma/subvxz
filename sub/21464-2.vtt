00:07.341 --> 00:10.970
<i>You tell yourselves
that you're the ones in control.</i>

00:11.887 --> 00:16.767
<i>They obey you, your technology,
your machines.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:21.939
<i>But what would you do without
your car, your telephone?</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:25.818
<i>What if all the airplanes
just stopped?</i>

00:28.612 --> 00:31.449
<i>Ten years ago,
computers were expensive toys.</i>

00:32.658 --> 00:35.828
<i>Today, civilization as we know
would fall apart without them.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:41.833
<i>You live in terror of a blackout,
a computer crash,</i>

00:41.834 --> 00:44.628
<i>a car that won't start,
a phone that doesn't ring.</i>

00:45.671 --> 00:48.006
<i>So you construct your lives,</i>

00:48.007 --> 00:50.593
<i>your whole society
so that won't happen.</i>

00:52.511 --> 00:55.723
<i>Everything revolves around
their needs, not yours.</i>

00:56.599 --> 00:59.560
<i>They buzz, you jump.
They beep, you answer.</i>

01:00.186 --> 01:03.898
<i>So ask yourself--
who's really in control?</i>

01:05.149 --> 01:08.444
<i>You or them?</i>

01:35.930 --> 01:38.139
Hey, we just got handed
a 56-page manifesto

01:38.140 --> 01:39.474
from the most elusive
criminal in the world,

01:39.475 --> 01:41.267
something so important
he wants both <i>The Post</i>

01:41.268 --> 01:43.228
and <i>The Times</i> to have it,
and I just want five minutes

01:43.229 --> 01:44.687
in the lab to read it.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.064
I'll gown up,
I'll look over their shoulders.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.315
It's five minutes.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.109
There's a system here,
a process,

01:49.110 --> 01:52.195
a process that begins with
a complete forensic analysis--

01:52.196 --> 01:55.532
thorough, unhurried, uncorrupted
by meddling rubberneckers.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.075
Yeah, I know, but
it's a big break in the case,

01:57.076 --> 01:58.660
and I'm here to be
a word guy, all right?

01:58.661 --> 02:00.829
You are here to wait
and to do what you're told.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.872
A big break in this case comes
when we pull a fingerprint

02:02.873 --> 02:05.793
off one of those pages,
when we find another Nathan R.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.711
A single strand of hair
would be far more valuable

02:08.712 --> 02:11.549
than anything you are gonna get
from reading the guy's rant.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.425
Well, "Dad, it is I"--
he got that from reading.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.136
Yeah, case friggin' closed.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.470
We wait for forensics--

02:17.471 --> 02:19.640
a month, a year,
however long it takes.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.476
And meanwhile, if you want
to see some real police work,

02:23.060 --> 02:24.436
step inside.

02:26.564 --> 02:29.440
Fitz, dude, you got to check this out.
It's friggin' sweet.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.400
You're up.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.112
We analyzed the postal stream
of the whole West Coast,

02:33.279 --> 02:36.489
and we traced the path
of every Unabom letter and package

02:36.490 --> 02:38.075
from the moment
it dropped into a mailbox

02:39.034 --> 02:42.036
to sorting and distro to final delivery,

02:42.037 --> 02:44.247
where we identified
two critical choke points.

02:44.248 --> 02:48.835
So, if Unabom decides to keep
dropping his mail in the Bay Area,

02:48.836 --> 02:51.171
there's a 95% chance
that it will be sorted

02:51.172 --> 02:52.797
through one of these two facilities.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.550
Meaning that we train
those handlers and sorters

02:55.551 --> 02:57.969
to identify a Unabom package.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.931
Then we could intercept
every bomb en route.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.601
Never have to worry about
a Unabom package again.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.519
Cool, right?

03:06.270 --> 03:08.147
Yeah.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.441
You still want to tell us about
"Dad, it is I"?

03:12.359 --> 03:15.529
Okay. Logistically
what are we talking about here?

03:16.280 --> 03:19.575
Okay, so you see
945 A and 945 B?

03:19.992 --> 03:21.785
Those are the checkpoints
right here...

03:22.620 --> 03:26.290
"Dad, it is I" tells us
he likes word games and puzzles

03:27.166 --> 03:29.543
and that he thinks
he's smarter than everyone

03:29.877 --> 03:32.420
and that he can be
sneaking on by us.

03:32.421 --> 03:36.716
Which it's kind of true,
'cause no one here noticed,

03:36.717 --> 03:40.638
'cause you all
underestimated him.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.933
He has problems talking to people.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.852
That's why he resorts to cyphers.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.814
And he's probably got Daddy issues.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.944
Now, I got all this
from a one-page letter.

03:56.362 --> 03:59.615
Imagine what I would get
off a 56-page manifesto.

04:03.619 --> 04:04.536
Oh, yeah.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.997
Now, that's my partner,
right there.

04:08.374 --> 04:12.127
You'll get your 56 pages
after forensics is finished.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.711
Goodbye.

04:16.215 --> 04:17.716
Yeah, it's Cole.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.428
What?!

04:23.013 --> 04:23.847
Where?

04:25.099 --> 04:27.308
I opened a letter
from the Unabomber.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.935
You work at
the <i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:30.104
You're the only person
who touched this?

04:30.312 --> 04:31.938
I'm just an editorial intern.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.400
I just open letters to the editor
as they come in.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.235
But I-I could have died.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.112
I could have been, like,
blown up or something.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.489
Yeah, but you weren't,
and a lot of people might be,

04:41.490 --> 04:43.366
so count your blessings
and shut up.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.618
<i>- What do you got?</i>
- Chief, you ready?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.621
<i>It's bad."Warning--
the terrorist group FC,</i>

04:48.622 --> 04:50.456
<i>"called 'Unabomber' by the FBI,</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:54.043
<i>"is planning to blow up an airliner
out of Los Angeles International Airport</i>

04:54.044 --> 04:56.297
<i>"sometime during the next six days.</i>

04:56.547 --> 04:58.923
"To prove that the writer
of this letters knows something

04:58.924 --> 05:03.928
about FC, the first two digits
of their identifying number are 55."

05:03.929 --> 05:05.263
<i>Is that number a match?</i>

05:05.264 --> 05:06.432
<i>What's the number he sent</i>
The Times?

05:08.517 --> 05:11.061
What's the authentication number
FC sent <i>The Times?</i>

05:14.440 --> 05:16.900
553254394.

05:18.986 --> 05:19.987
It's him.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.905
Trisha, get Director Freeh
on the phone,

05:22.906 --> 05:26.159
LAPD commissioner, FAA,
and alert Janet Reno's office,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.413
and make it clear we have
a potential mass-casualty situation.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.832
When a letter arrived
at a San Francisco newspaper

05:32.833 --> 05:34.876
threatening to blow up an airliner...

05:34.877 --> 05:37.795
They say it bears all the marks
of the Unabomber.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.548
Federal officials believe
the sender is the terrorist

05:40.549 --> 05:42.300
who has been sending bombs...

05:42.301 --> 05:44.677
The Unabomber appears
to be ready to strike again.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.349
This time the threatened target
is a jetliner flying out of Los Angeles.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.226
Frederick Benjamin Isaac Wood,
FBI Wood.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.145
Uh-huh, but those
were planes with depleted fuel tanks.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.688
- Return address 549...
- Here we're talking about

05:55.689 --> 05:57.732
fully fueled jetliners
within a shrapnel radius

05:57.733 --> 05:59.984
of an explosive device
of unknown size and power.

05:59.985 --> 06:00.902
How much fuel is in a 747
that's about to take off?

06:00.903 --> 06:05.156
Phil, now tell me where we are
on refraction beam scanners.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.992
Uh-huh. Right.
So now you see--

06:07.993 --> 06:09.369
No, it's got to be mobile.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.996
You can't bring items into
the airport to be scanned.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.373
Jesus, Phil.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.416
You got to do it on the runway.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.960
We got to just do it plane by plane.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.796
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, 2-1-breach...

06:19.004 --> 06:20.923
Lucas. Hey, can I--
can I borrow your pen, please?

06:21.090 --> 06:23.424
Thank you. 2-1-3.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.885
We're at about 30%,
but it looks like

06:25.886 --> 06:28.680
all the big databases
are up and searchable.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.434
IRS, USPS...

06:33.894 --> 06:34.978
Social Security?

06:50.786 --> 06:52.286
Do you realize what this means?

06:52.287 --> 06:55.706
This is gonna be the first major case
solved by computer.

06:55.707 --> 06:56.708
If this is the guy.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.169
There's no if,
it's driven by the data.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.132
Think about all the data
the government has on its citizens.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.051
Addresses, employment,
military, census.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.346
Eighty years of data,
250,000,000 people,

07:10.347 --> 07:12.140
but you can't do anything with it

07:12.141 --> 07:15.268
because it's scattered across
dozens of different systems.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.896
That's why I built the MPP,
to bring all that data together

07:18.897 --> 07:21.607
in one place for the first time.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.777
I mean, look,
FC's authentication number

07:24.236 --> 07:26.488
looks a lot like
a Social Security number, right?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.199
So I did a search.
And it's a match.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.577
The number belongs
to an Alan Meeks.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.579
40-year-old white male.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.290
Then I crunched the USPS data.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.877
Look where Meeks has been
living for the past 30 years.

07:40.461 --> 07:45.048
Oakland, San Francisco,
Salt Lake City, Sacramento.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.178
It's all the key locations
associated with Unabom activity.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.345
Where is he now?

07:51.346 --> 07:52.514
He's already in custody.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.058
They arrested Meeks right here.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.019
Recognize the place?

07:58.187 --> 08:00.147
Yeah, RenTech, it's the site
of the Hugh Scrutton bomb.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.232
The Unabomber's first kill

08:02.733 --> 08:04.443
returning to the scene of the crime.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.236
They're getting Meeks ready
for interrogation right now,

08:07.237 --> 08:09.072
and I got to know, if Meeks
is the Unabomber,

08:10.115 --> 08:11.742
what was he looking for here?

08:21.251 --> 08:23.587
<i>Why'd you come back?
Why this place?</i>

08:24.087 --> 08:25.963
<i>Computer rental store.</i>

08:25.964 --> 08:28.216
<i>Computers. Technology.</i>

08:28.217 --> 08:29.968
<i>What did these people
symbolize to you?</i>

08:38.143 --> 08:41.312
<i>You got to work early,
you didn't expect them to be there.</i>

08:41.313 --> 08:43.398
<i>10 seconds, 20 seconds--
that's all you needed.</i>

08:50.072 --> 08:53.033
<i>But she looked, and suddenly
the Unabomber was flesh and blood.</i>

08:55.786 --> 08:59.664
<i>A man, not a concept, and that's
why this scared you so much.</i>

08:59.665 --> 09:01.375
<i>That's why you stopped for six years...</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:02.709
Hey, Hugh?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.840
Phyllis, do you have that invoice

09:09.841 --> 09:11.760
from Phoenix Games and Hobbies?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.721
I'm trying to get this stuff
out the door before we open.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.682
Phyllis?

09:17.516 --> 09:18.850
Are you in the bathroom?

09:29.152 --> 09:32.948
<i>Even though it felt good
to finally succeed.</i>

09:47.588 --> 09:50.131
He was reliving it, savoring it.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.759
Which he never got to do in '85
because of the eyewitness.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.098
Meeks is ready!
Let's get over there.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.934
This could really be him.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.397
"Pure wood."
Read 'em and weep, Fitzy.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.857
That's the Unabomber.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.650
T-H-E-N.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.237
"Thicker than water."
It's not him.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.615
It's a spelling mistake.
So what?

10:15.324 --> 10:16.949
You get drunk,
you get a tattoo--

10:16.950 --> 10:18.326
I don't remember seeing
a spelling mistake

10:18.327 --> 10:19.161
in all those letters.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.246
Does this guy look like
the author of a manifesto

10:22.247 --> 10:24.249
entitled "Industrial Society
and its Future"?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.293
He sure does to me.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.341
Here's the thing, I don't think
you meant to kill anybody,

10:32.716 --> 10:34.592
I think you just wanted
to send a message,

10:34.593 --> 10:35.844
to scare them a little.

10:36.011 --> 10:39.472
I definitely didn't mean to kill anyone,
that's for damn sure.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.349
Look, I believe you.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.185
But these guys, they don't.
And they're hard asses.

10:44.186 --> 10:48.230
So tell me how to stop LAX.
Help me help you.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.441
What's LAX?

10:49.608 --> 10:50.900
If you make this hard for me...

10:50.901 --> 10:52.109
- I didn't mean to kill anybody.
- I will make your life

10:52.110 --> 10:54.654
- a living nightmare.
- I can't take back what I did,

10:54.655 --> 10:56.614
and I'll live with this
the rest of my life.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.325
I paid my debts to society.

11:01.119 --> 11:04.081
Wait. Excuse me?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.458
Eight years,
Iowa State Pen.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.462
I came out a changed man.
I-I learned my lesson.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.715
I never drove drunk again.
Not once, I swear.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.806
Meeks was in jail half the time
the Unabomber was active.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.349
How come that wasn't in my file?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.769
We pulled everything we could--
Cali, Federal.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.311
You're telling me you don't have

11:27.312 --> 11:29.690
Iowa Bureau of Prisons
records in your MPP?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.193
Didn't we do this before?

11:33.860 --> 11:34.945
It's just for our files.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.326
Here.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.495
What's "pure wood"?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.081
Pure Aryan Peckerwood.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.000
There ain't no jungle-bunny
blood in these veins.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.587
Right. Thicker than water, right?

11:53.338 --> 11:55.549
- Thicker than what?
- Thicker than water.

11:55.841 --> 11:59.052
"Wudder"? Well, where
the hell you from?

11:59.594 --> 12:02.723
Who talks like that?
Y'all hear that, "wudder"?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.516
Christ.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.520
Fitz, let's go.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.148
<i>The extraordinary
precautions come</i>

12:12.149 --> 12:14.567
<i>because a letter was mailed
to a San Francisco newspaper</i>

12:14.568 --> 12:16.820
<i>from a man the FBI calls
the Unabomber.</i>

12:17.070 --> 12:17.988
Anything?

12:18.488 --> 12:20.948
Wudder under the bridge.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.576
Damn.
You heard that, too?

12:23.577 --> 12:24.745
What Fitz has with his hoagie.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.747
Wudder?

12:27.539 --> 12:29.040
Tabster, stone cold.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.541
Come on. Philly.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.834
Fitz, Burkhardt,
conference room.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.962
I've never heard you say pierogi,
but you do say wudder.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.630
Water. Water.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.675
I like wudder.
It's part of who you are.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.095
So, one word, one tiny slip,
and you think you know who I am?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.223
Are you seriously pissed off?

12:46.141 --> 12:46.975
About what?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.770
I say one word slightly wrong,
and you can all peg me

12:50.771 --> 12:52.022
as the Philly street cop
out of his depth.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.316
Fitz! Now!

12:57.235 --> 12:59.196
Dude! Are you serious?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.575
So, you can read it.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.953
Yeah? What is this?

13:07.454 --> 13:10.414
The forensic report.
300 pages that say we found nothing.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.958
No, not the report, the document.
His document, his manifesto.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.085
They're over there.
No one else wanted one.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.003
What?

13:16.004 --> 13:17.797
Well, you're talking about
three different dossiers,

13:17.798 --> 13:20.050
and I don't have them, so--

13:21.092 --> 13:22.302
Hold on a second.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.304
For 17 years, the Unabomber
has been trying to say something

13:25.305 --> 13:26.848
with these bombs,
trying to send us a message,

13:27.265 --> 13:29.559
and now he lays it out,
everything he's been trying to tell us,

13:30.143 --> 13:31.770
and you don't want to take
the time to read it?

13:32.062 --> 13:34.606
We're dealing with a major
airport shutdown here,

13:35.315 --> 13:38.777
so write up a three-page synopsis,
clean, no typos,

13:39.110 --> 13:40.320
and we'll give it a look.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.239
Yep. All right.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.909
New Unabom letter sent to <i>The Times.</i>

13:46.910 --> 13:47.953
What?

13:48.203 --> 13:49.663
New York is faxing it through.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.540
Jesus!
Greg, I got to go!

13:53.959 --> 13:55.126
Look at page 3.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.011
Is this guy jerking us around
or what?

14:05.387 --> 14:07.388
"Since the public
has a short memory,

14:07.389 --> 14:10.307
"we decided to play
one last 'prank'

14:10.308 --> 14:12.560
"to remind them who we are.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.771
"But, no, we haven't tried
to plant a bomb

14:15.772 --> 14:18.024
on an airliner."

14:18.817 --> 14:20.818
Recently is in parentheses.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.237
Freeh, on phone:
<i>He says it's a prank.</i>

14:23.280 --> 14:25.282
Yes, sir. One last prank.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.075
<i>And we're certain
it's from the Unabomber?</i>

14:29.286 --> 14:30.661
It's been authenticated, sir.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.123
It is definitely from the Unabomber.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.584
And we will get you
our recommendation.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.211
<i>What if he's just trying
to get our guard down?</i>

14:38.587 --> 14:40.337
<i>He's got a bomb
in one of those planes,</i>

14:40.338 --> 14:42.549
<i>just waiting for us to clear them
for takeoff, and then boom.</i>

14:42.841 --> 14:44.341
<i>We get another Lockerbie
on my watch</i>

14:44.342 --> 14:46.219
<i>because I took a serial bomber
at his word.</i>

14:47.554 --> 14:50.472
Personally, I think
this whole manifesto thing

14:50.473 --> 14:51.349
could be a red herring.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.183
We're dealing with a dummy here,

14:53.184 --> 14:55.519
an airline mechanic
with a G.E.D., max.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.064
So, who's to say he didn't
retype somebody else's essay

14:59.065 --> 15:02.109
to throw us off the scent,
to draw us down blind alleys,

15:02.110 --> 15:06.196
to keep us away from the real leads
in the real world, forensics?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.657
Sir, now that the manifesto
has cleared forensics,

15:08.658 --> 15:10.993
I think it's imperative that
our agents read this document.

15:10.994 --> 15:11.912
Okay, stop.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.499
The Unabomber has threatened
to blow an airplane out of the sky.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.712
I've got four senators
and Janet Reno on my call sheet,

15:20.879 --> 15:23.255
asking me whether
to believe this letter,

15:23.256 --> 15:26.175
where he says he's going to kill
a few hundred innocent people,

15:26.176 --> 15:29.387
or this one, where he says
the bomb threat is just a prank.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.305
So, I'm not reading anything else.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.515
I'm reading this and trying to decide

15:33.516 --> 15:35.976
whether LAX can reopen for business.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.187
And if I make the wrong call,

15:38.188 --> 15:40.439
a few hundred people are
gonna be blown out of the sky.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.025
So give me a profile
that answers that question.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.070
If not, that's a stack of papers.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.364
These are human lives.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.240
Got it?

15:50.241 --> 15:52.619
Okay. What do we got?

15:57.248 --> 16:00.085
Dude, have you read this?
In the manifesto? Listen.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.545
"In modern society, all that's
required of you is obedience."

16:03.546 --> 16:05.422
Isn't that exactly what Cole said?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.133
The manifesto has to wait.
There are lives at stake.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.177
bomb threat, prank.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.137
Which one's the truth?

16:13.556 --> 16:16.226
How could we
possibly know that?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.779
You know, Fitz, whatever it is
you're going through,

16:28.780 --> 16:30.322
it didn't start two years ago.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.825
It didn't start with this case.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.119
It happened long before the Unabom.
It must have.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.206
I know.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.544
I just don't know when
I started to feel so powerless.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.963
Hey, we all feel that way.
Everyone does.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.090
If everybody feels that way,
what do we do about it?

16:47.424 --> 16:48.882
Nothing.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.135
We like it.

16:51.136 --> 16:55.432
We like feeling trapped, crushed.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.810
I guess freedom is far more
terrifying than slavery.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.645
But there's nothing to do.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.314
It's life. You suck it up and you live.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.984
That's not--that's not life.
That's not living.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.069
That's sleepwalking.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.906
Watching TV, eating trash,

17:12.240 --> 17:16.202
working to--to become something
for someone else.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.287
And nobody does anything about it.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.289
Nobody even tries.
Nobody except for Ted.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.167
Yeah, but, Fitz,
he's the Unabomber.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.505
He's evil.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.261
Just down here.

17:45.982 --> 17:46.816
You gonna be okay?

17:48.401 --> 17:49.402
I don't know.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.032
I have to go in there,
I have to face him.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.750
Go.

18:35.406 --> 18:39.077
<i>Is there a bomb on a plane, FC,
or is it a prank?</i>

18:48.503 --> 18:51.047
<i>Boss needs these reports clean.
No typos.</i>

18:52.298 --> 18:53.800
<i>Cole wouldn't be happy, FC.</i>

19:16.114 --> 19:17.448
<i>Excessive soldering.</i>

19:28.793 --> 19:30.211
This is the original letter.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.005
Look, he punched
right through the paper,

19:32.630 --> 19:34.841
not just crossing out his mistakes--
obliterating them.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.594
Profilers talk about
signatures versus M.O.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.179
M.O. is everything necessary
to complete the crime,

19:40.180 --> 19:41.598
but signatures are the extras.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.975
They reveal the psychology,
the character.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.145
Damn. Like correcting
the hell out of that letter.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.438
Yeah, that's right.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.149
But, uh, the RenTech bomb,

19:51.816 --> 19:54.360
the forensic report says something
about excessive soldering.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.738
His signature, definitely.

19:57.572 --> 19:58.573
How do you know that?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.244
Don't worry.
It's just a mock-up.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.789
But it's the exact copy of the way
that bomb looked before it blew up.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.917
You built this?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.545
What's wrong with you?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.631
You sure you're
not the Unabomber?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.676
And all this is forensic evidence?

20:19.886 --> 20:22.722
Yes, sir.
I built this and a few others.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.556
Bosses thought it was
a waste of time,

20:24.557 --> 20:25.850
but I learned a lot by doing it.

20:26.601 --> 20:30.395
He carves "FC" on the most
indestructible component of each bomb--

20:30.396 --> 20:32.731
the part that he's sure
will survive the blast.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.816
Just to make sure
we know it's him.

20:34.943 --> 20:37.277
Like the excess soldering,
he just floods all the connections

20:37.278 --> 20:38.446
like he's trying to hide them,

20:38.821 --> 20:40.322
then there's tons of extra epoxy

20:40.323 --> 20:43.076
all at the joints
that no one seemed to report.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.495
Totally unnecessary.
Just slathered it on.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.413
Signatures. Not M.O.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.084
He didn't want anyone
to see the cracks.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.925
What's your name again?

20:59.259 --> 21:00.468
Ernie Esposito.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.596
Thanks, Ernie.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.068
This is my analysis
on the LAX bomb threat.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.153
It's clean, no typos,
lots of big words.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.115
Janet Reno will read it,
and she'll be impressed by you.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.450
What's the bottom line?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.745
Well, in my opinion, it's a prank.

21:28.663 --> 21:29.998
There's no bomb at LAX.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.376
FC cares about his reputation,
his credibility.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.503
He's ashamed of his mistakes,
and he tries to obliterate them.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.755
He tries to hide
all the joints in his bombs

21:38.756 --> 21:41.091
so we don't see the work.

21:41.092 --> 21:44.011
He's obsessed with presenting
this perfect public image.

21:44.012 --> 21:47.014
He wants to be seen as intelligent,
as logical, as superior.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.016
But it's a...

21:48.349 --> 21:50.517
It's a fragile self-image,
because he's really just afraid

21:50.518 --> 21:52.395
that everyone's
gonna see his flaws.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.149
Now, the bomb threat,
that services his need for power.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.608
You know,
he enjoys making us squirm,

21:58.609 --> 22:01.279
but his reputation,
that's the most important thing he has.

22:01.904 --> 22:05.615
And he's not gonna give us
the ammunition to go to the press

22:05.616 --> 22:07.409
so they can hold up something
that he wrote and say,

22:07.410 --> 22:09.871
"This guy's untrustworthy,
he's a liar.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.957
"He's a bloodthirsty lunatic
who has no credibility

22:13.958 --> 22:15.335
and will say anything
to kill people."

22:16.669 --> 22:20.173
It's just all my opinion, but,
um, you know, I can back it up.

22:20.506 --> 22:24.260
Including the physical evidence,
I--I stand by it.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.931
The thing about Fitz--
he's no BS-er,

22:29.390 --> 22:30.933
for better or for worse.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.979
Okay, we're gonna read it
and pass it up the chain.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.732
Thanks for this.

22:38.149 --> 22:41.194
This might cross Janet Reno's desk,
so stay close.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.200
You listen to me,
you get a gold star.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.827
A little obedience is all it takes.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.454
I think FC says that
in the manifesto, too.

22:52.455 --> 22:55.750
You can put that
in your three-page summary.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.503
Leadership tips from the Unabomber.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.264
Now we dig in.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.771
Let's go for the big picture.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.356
He wrote 56 pages,

23:19.357 --> 23:21.317
laying out his philosophy
of the modern world.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.904
He called it
"Industrial Society and its Future."

23:25.571 --> 23:27.365
We call it his manifesto.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.451
So, he sends the bombs as messages.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.286
He's struggling to make himself heard.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.455
So, what's the message?

23:35.206 --> 23:36.289
Technology sucks?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.958
All right, technology sucks.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.585
And we are basically screwed.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.880
The Unabomber just opened
a door into his mind.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.757
We need to step through it, so...

23:45.675 --> 23:46.759
Opening line...

23:47.593 --> 23:50.053
"The Industrial Revolution
and its consequences

23:50.054 --> 23:51.889
have been a disaster
for the human race."

23:52.140 --> 23:54.724
Technology was supposed to
set us free, but it doesn't.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.269
Like the car thing.
Cars were invented, and then,

23:57.270 --> 23:59.689
we're all suddenly free
to go wherever we want.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.025
But then, basically, it becomes
mandatory to have a car.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.360
So, instead of becoming more free,
we become more limited,

24:05.361 --> 24:06.486
more constrained.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.157
I mean, every city and society
is all rearranged around cars

24:10.158 --> 24:12.909
until you can't even buy food
without driving somewhere.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.119
I mean, they forced upon us.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.705
Yeah, TV seemed harmless, too,
before we flipped them around.

24:16.706 --> 24:19.583
We put CCTV cameras everywhere
and turned it into a tool to watch us.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.793
We can't even drive fast
if we're in a hurry

24:21.794 --> 24:23.378
or slow if we want to chill out.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.173
We started in charge.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.259
Now we're slaves
to our own technology.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.928
"Human beings are being
permanently reduced

24:31.929 --> 24:34.765
"to engineered products
and mere cogs in the social machine,

24:35.725 --> 24:38.686
"deprived of dignity,
autonomy, and freedom.

24:39.645 --> 24:43.023
"The only option available
to us is obedience.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.151
"We're being turned into caged rats,

24:46.402 --> 24:48.612
"distracted from the maze
by the meaningless cheese

24:48.613 --> 24:50.114
"we're running after.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.284
"Status, promotion, money, nicer cars,

24:53.701 --> 24:55.495
"bigger houses, more TVs,

24:56.120 --> 24:59.332
"blasted with entertainment,
adjusted with therapy and Prozac

24:59.957 --> 25:02.251
"till you don't even want
to be free anymore.

25:03.127 --> 25:07.088
Or if you can't be adjusted,
the psych ward."

25:10.510 --> 25:11.969
"Or prison."

25:17.433 --> 25:20.394
"The only alternative,
the only hope for us,

25:21.062 --> 25:23.313
the only way to break free..."

25:26.025 --> 25:27.527
"is to blow the whole thing up."

25:34.534 --> 25:35.743
I'm ready.

25:51.092 --> 25:52.593
Kaczynski, you ready?

26:00.476 --> 26:02.853
Ted, as your attorney,
I'm begging you to reconsider this.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.897
Do not go in there alone
with Fitzgerald.

26:06.315 --> 26:09.442
It is unthinkably reckless
for the defendant in a capital case

26:09.443 --> 26:10.986
to, A--
talk with the arresting agent,

26:10.987 --> 26:13.072
and B--
do so without counsel present.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.367
This is a huge risk for you.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.077
And there's no reason to take it.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.537
Let me come in there with you.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.247
I'll stay out of the way,
just observe,

26:22.248 --> 26:23.415
and be ready to step in.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.254
I'll be in the next room
the whole time.

26:28.462 --> 26:29.629
All you need to do
to end the interview

26:29.630 --> 26:31.132
is to ask for me, okay?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.434
We need
a guilty plea from Ted.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.019
This is our only shot.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.313
You're our only shot.

26:47.732 --> 26:48.649
Right.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.153
Give us a second.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.664
We know Ted Kaczynski's
the Unabomber,

27:04.665 --> 27:05.833
but we can't go to trial.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.878
This case hangs on so many
different technicalities.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.922
If we go before a jury,
if we roll that dice...

27:14.008 --> 27:15.635
These are dangerous,
uncertain times.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.429
Look at Waco. Look at O.J.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.098
Even the Menendez brothers
hung their juries.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.560
The Unabomber has an I.Q. of 168.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.604
Think about that--168.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.815
If Ted Kaczynski goes to trial,
he could walk.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.691
If he walks, he disappears.

27:31.692 --> 27:34.027
If he disappears,
he's back in action.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.988
Only this time,
we'll never find him.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.408
The guilty plea is the only way
to make sure that doesn't happen.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.203
Listen, Fitz.

27:44.205 --> 27:48.793
I think Ted asked for you because
he recognized a kindred spirit.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.379
Play into that.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.466
Make him feel smart,
understood, sympathized with.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.885
Build a connection,
but stay opaque.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.928
Don't give him too much.

27:59.929 --> 28:02.598
He knows you as well
as you know him. Better.

28:03.391 --> 28:06.226
He's gonna be probing you
for weaknesses all the time,

28:06.227 --> 28:07.812
looking for anything
to go against us.

28:12.233 --> 28:14.192
Get him talking,
build a connection,

28:14.193 --> 28:16.487
then start to steer him
towards the guilty plea.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.366
You're trying to help him,

28:21.367 --> 28:23.118
trying to save him
from the electric chair.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.495
You're his only friend,
but do it gently.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.706
Don't spook him, okay?

28:27.707 --> 28:29.374
Get him there.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.113
Okay.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.672
Agent Fitzgerald?

29:20.092 --> 29:23.095
I am so glad to make
your acquaintance at last.

29:30.686 --> 29:31.937
Ellie, on phone: <i>When would be
a good time for you?</i>

29:32.605 --> 29:35.316
<i>I already talked to Kim
about taking the days.</i>

29:35.524 --> 29:38.109
<i>Nancy says she can cover for me,
and Mom would watch the boys.</i>

29:38.110 --> 29:42.740
<i>So, just tell me when,
'cause I took it.</i>

29:43.574 --> 29:45.117
Good to hear it.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.036
That's great.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.624
<i>Uh, why don't you just call me back</i>

29:51.791 --> 29:54.125
<i>- when I won't be just talking to myself?</i>
- Oh, no. No, no.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.087
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm listening. I am.

29:58.547 --> 30:01.342
It's just, you know...

30:03.469 --> 30:04.595
you know...

30:07.765 --> 30:08.933
<i>What's going on with you?</i>

30:13.813 --> 30:15.147
<i>I'm just gonna call you back.</i>

30:18.317 --> 30:19.944
Okay.
Okay, bye.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.132
Um, that's for today.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.969
Fitz. Right now.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.516
Janet Reno, on speaker:
<i>Well, we've looked at the FAA reports,</i>

30:51.517 --> 30:54.519
<i>LAPD
and, uh, airport briefings,</i>

30:54.520 --> 30:57.063
<i>read the material
S.A.C. Ackerman sent.</i>

30:57.064 --> 30:59.148
<i>Based on what we've seen, uh,</i>

30:59.149 --> 31:02.527
<i>A.G.'s office is good to sign off
on reopening LAX.</i>

31:02.528 --> 31:05.655
<i>- How about you, Bill?
- FAA is good with that.</i>

31:05.656 --> 31:09.826
<i>FBI Director Freeh here.
I'll confirm that from our end</i>

31:09.827 --> 31:12.412
<i>and give the green light
to flight control.</i>

31:12.413 --> 31:14.706
<i>Flight control,
I see the green light here,</i>

31:14.707 --> 31:16.166
<i>good to reopen runways.</i>

31:16.959 --> 31:18.627
<i>First plane should be up
momentarily.</i>

31:19.211 --> 31:21.087
Flight control,
this is S.A.C. Ackerman,

31:21.088 --> 31:23.132
permission to stay on the line?

31:23.966 --> 31:24.800
<i>Affirmative, Agent.</i>

31:26.635 --> 31:30.388
The Unabom device that almost
blew up American Airlines 444

31:30.389 --> 31:34.852
was triggered by an altimeter
set to blow up at 20,000 feet.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.025
<i>American flight 7 is airborne.</i>

31:44.737 --> 31:46.572
<i>United 732 airborne.</i>

31:49.575 --> 31:51.994
<i>TWA one-niner-niner airborne.</i>

31:59.793 --> 32:03.088
<i>This is American flight 7.
We are climbing to 15,000 feet.</i>

32:03.756 --> 32:05.424
<i>Climbing to 20,000.</i>

32:05.966 --> 32:07.676
<i>Checked in uniform, 7.</i>

32:08.135 --> 32:09.637
<i>We're approaching 10,000.</i>

32:11.639 --> 32:13.974
<i>KLM 206, we're climbing now.</i>

32:16.769 --> 32:21.690
<i>- KLM 206, cruising altitude, over.
- Approaching cruising altitude.</i>

32:22.566 --> 32:25.318
<i>American flight 7,
we're at 25,000,</i>

32:25.319 --> 32:29.530
<i>- reaching cruising altitude now.
- Approaching cruising altitude, over.</i>

32:40.960 --> 32:43.169
<i>All clear. All clear.</i>

32:43.170 --> 32:44.253
<i>You hear that, Agent?</i>

32:44.254 --> 32:46.631
Loud and clear.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.758
Thank God.

33:08.696 --> 33:09.904
You made the right call.

33:09.905 --> 33:10.906
I shouldn't have made any call.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.700
All those people on the plane,
and it was based on what,

33:13.701 --> 33:15.077
on some letters?

33:15.619 --> 33:17.204
It was the right call.

33:22.668 --> 33:26.087
You really think you can get
something good out of this manifesto,

33:26.088 --> 33:27.089
something worthwhile?

33:28.048 --> 33:29.883
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I can.

33:31.885 --> 33:34.138
Okay. I'm giving you an office.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.390
And a team, if you want it.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.145
Maybe you'll even read
the manifesto now.

33:41.478 --> 33:44.481
I will. We all will.

33:44.982 --> 33:47.901
Actually, I already tried to read it.
Oh, no, I did.

33:48.068 --> 33:52.031
But, come on, end notes
and all these dead sentences.

33:52.614 --> 33:53.866
Who writes like this?

33:57.036 --> 33:58.287
Who writes like this?

34:03.167 --> 34:04.793
Fitz?

34:28.817 --> 34:30.152
Who writes like this?

34:42.539 --> 34:45.250
When I say "wudder,"
you learn everything about me.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.754
One tiny word, one tiny mistake,

34:49.880 --> 34:52.465
and you can tell I'm from Philly,
blue-collar, local school,

34:52.466 --> 34:53.549
fan of Dave Schultz.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.052
Just like when you say "bruh,"

34:55.344 --> 34:57.012
it could only be from
San Francisco, right?

35:01.100 --> 35:05.646
What if there's a "wudder" or a "bruh"
in here, in the manifesto?

35:06.814 --> 35:09.358
I mean, how do we even
start to look for that?

35:12.069 --> 35:13.445
I don't know.
Read it again.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.906
Oh, boy.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.200
Get some coffee on then, bruh.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.550
<i>Agent Fitzgerald.</i>

35:46.353 --> 35:47.646
Long way from Montana.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.731
Oh, yeah, well,

35:51.233 --> 35:54.235
most people carry their cage
with them wherever they go.

35:54.236 --> 35:57.321
At least if I remain
disgusted by this place,

35:57.322 --> 35:58.991
I know I'm still alive.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.701
Still free in here.

36:02.035 --> 36:02.911
So why me?

36:04.121 --> 36:06.539
Why you? You wrote the document
that put me in here.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.791
Your linguistic analysis
of the manifesto

36:08.792 --> 36:10.042
got them the search warrant,

36:10.043 --> 36:11.460
the search warrant
got them the evidence--

36:11.461 --> 36:14.423
The document that
put you in here, you wrote.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.847
I am becoming very well-acquainted
with your work.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.725
It is the product
of great imagination.

36:25.726 --> 36:28.477
What I really appreciate about you

36:28.478 --> 36:32.024
is that most people take language
for granted, but not you.

36:33.901 --> 36:36.194
You saw it differently,
and that is the first step

36:36.195 --> 36:38.906
toward becoming free--
a shift in perspective.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.242
Manifesto, for instance.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.786
I never liked that moniker.

36:45.787 --> 36:48.247
It makes it sound like
an unconsidered rant,

36:48.248 --> 36:51.250
and you and I both appreciate

36:51.251 --> 36:54.378
the power and specificity of words.

36:54.379 --> 36:58.550
Manifesto versus article,
insanity versus enlightenment,

36:59.384 --> 37:03.180
mental breakdown versus
on extended leave from active duty.

37:04.848 --> 37:09.436
You have had a change
of life circumstance,

37:09.686 --> 37:12.231
since your work on
the Unabom case, am I wrong?

37:12.940 --> 37:13.774
Yeah, I have.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.567
Because of what I allegedly wrote?

37:16.610 --> 37:18.654
- Yeah.
- What was it?

37:19.238 --> 37:20.656
Just between us.

37:22.491 --> 37:23.700
When did it all click?

37:28.330 --> 37:29.373
No?

37:30.165 --> 37:34.127
Well, for me, uh,
it all began in Chicago.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.381
One day, this mockingbird began
singing in the backyard there,

37:37.589 --> 37:40.217
you know, that puffed-up confidence,
just belting out his song,

37:40.425 --> 37:44.178
and...I began to realize

37:44.179 --> 37:46.723
that the mockingbird
is singing the car alarm.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.935
Ba-beep, ba-beep.
You know the one?

37:50.310 --> 37:53.521
Rrr, rrr....
And I--I just sat there,

37:53.522 --> 37:57.276
listening to that poor, dumb bird
for maybe an hour straight, thinking,

37:58.068 --> 37:59.151
"What have we done?"

37:59.152 --> 38:02.823
How wrong that was,
and it stuck with me.

38:03.031 --> 38:06.325
I kept coming back to it,
just trying to figure out

38:06.326 --> 38:09.204
where in the world
we had gone so wrong

38:09.663 --> 38:11.665
that it had ended up here.

38:15.669 --> 38:17.045
For me, it was the part about driving.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.427
Every time I got in the car,
I thought about it.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.179
The more I drove,
the more it made sense.

38:30.892 --> 38:33.186
Like, there was this one night
I was driving home from work,

38:34.062 --> 38:36.857
and there was nobody on the street--
I mean, nobody.

38:37.399 --> 38:38.775
And I'm sitting at a red light,

38:39.568 --> 38:41.445
just waiting, waiting.

38:46.158 --> 38:49.036
And there's no cars anywhere.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.333
But, still, I sat there.
I obeyed.

38:56.585 --> 38:59.170
That's when I realized
it's not about technology,

38:59.171 --> 39:01.340
it's not about machines.

39:01.590 --> 39:04.550
It's about what they're doing to us.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.886
It's about what they're doing to us,
what they do to our hearts,

39:06.887 --> 39:08.220
'cause our hearts
are no longer free.

39:08.221 --> 39:10.473
- And you wanted to be free.
- Right.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.434
You wanted your human dignity,
your autonomy.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.603
- Yeah. But --
- Everybody wants that.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.189
People want it so badly,
they're dying by the thousands every day,

39:18.190 --> 39:20.816
just trying to salvage
some of their humanity.

39:20.817 --> 39:21.735
- Okay--
- Think about this:

39:22.486 --> 39:25.654
More people have died from suicide
in just the time we've been talking

39:25.655 --> 39:27.741
than I allegedly killed
in my entire career.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.369
More people died
from anti-depressants,

39:31.370 --> 39:33.287
plastic surgery, fast-food.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.041
Why--w-why is everybody
so terrified of me?

39:37.626 --> 39:39.419
And ask yourself this question:

39:40.462 --> 39:44.591
Why are these men in suits
so desperate to prove that I'm crazy?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.053
I will tell you.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.639
It's because they know that I'm right.

39:52.516 --> 39:53.683
I'm awake.

39:54.518 --> 39:55.685
<i>- They're asleep.
- Yeah.</i>

39:55.977 --> 39:58.229
<i>And they're terrified they might
have to wake up, too,</i>

39:58.230 --> 40:01.524
<i>and turn off their cellphones
and their TVs</i>

40:01.525 --> 40:03.359
<i>and their video games</i>

40:03.360 --> 40:06.279
and face themselves
the way that you and I have.

40:08.657 --> 40:09.950
You and I?

40:10.117 --> 40:11.118
You and I.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.371
Ted, I came here 'cause
I believe in what you wrote.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.123
Good.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.959
I think you asked me here
'cause you need an ally

40:19.960 --> 40:21.127
to help save your life,

40:21.128 --> 40:22.712
so you can spread your message
and change things.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.550
Really change things. Right?

40:27.259 --> 40:28.217
Right.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.553
Now, I've gone through all your options.
I think a guilty plea--

40:30.554 --> 40:31.388
No.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.932
No.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.144
<i>And he was doing so well.</i>

40:37.978 --> 40:41.605
<i>I can talk about my options
with any one of these Barbary apes</i>

40:41.606 --> 40:43.024
<i>watching through the cameras.</i>

40:44.359 --> 40:46.027
But I chose you

40:46.528 --> 40:49.865
because I thought you were different.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.244
Next time,

40:55.245 --> 40:58.497
you might bring me some
writing paper and some stamps.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.374
They're so stingy in here,

41:00.375 --> 41:02.377
and I have so much
correspondence.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.255
It's really quite overwhelming.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.259
Thank you.
