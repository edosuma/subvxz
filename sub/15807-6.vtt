01:22.650 --> 01:25.150
skipper, why don't we
get gilligan to help us
with this well?

01:25.218 --> 01:28.086
Gilligan help?
Professor, you've been
out in the sun too long.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.487
All he'd have to do
is dig.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.789
He can't do
anything wrong
if he's just digging.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.257
Yeah? Ha ha ha!

01:32.326 --> 01:34.593
Well, alright.
Let's find out.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.128
Gilligan!

01:36.196 --> 01:38.863
Now, uh, nothing
pretentious, gilligan.
You understand?

01:38.932 --> 01:42.367
A simple, flowing,
15-room mansion,
right, lovey?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.202
I mean, 4 baths,
you understand?

01:44.271 --> 01:46.771
And we'll have the--
the servants' quarters
will be over there.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.740
Gilligan!
That's the skipper.
I gotta run.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.275
No, you'll do
nothing of the sort.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.711
You see, we're planning
the howell hills estate.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.679
And you don't want
to get into trouble
with the skipper, dear.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.714
Lovey, we are no longer
on shipboard.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.650
You see, now,
this is exactly the way

01:58.719 --> 01:59.985
I want the little
estate built.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.353
You see--
gilligan!!

02:01.422 --> 02:02.520
I gotta go.
Later.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.955
Stand your ground,
gilligan.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.323
If I do,
I'll be buried in it.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.758
Let the boy
go, dear.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.461
He is no longer
a boy, lovey.
He is a man.

02:09.529 --> 02:10.294
Skipper: Gilligan!
I'm a boy.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.663
Uh, skipper,

02:11.732 --> 02:13.264
you're interrupting
a business conference.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.466
Besides, you're standing
in the powder room.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.234
Powder room?
Business conference?

02:16.303 --> 02:19.004
Gilligan, will you get
over there and start
digging?
Aye, aye, sir.

02:19.073 --> 02:19.971
Come back here,
gilligan.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.072
Get going,
gilligan.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.240
Come back here,
gilligan!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.208
Get going,
gilligan!

02:23.276 --> 02:24.676
Come back here!

02:24.745 --> 02:25.577
I gave him
an order!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.278
And I gave him
a job!

02:27.347 --> 02:28.446
I wish
i were twins.

02:28.515 --> 02:29.548
Maybe we should
toss a coin.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.650
Coin?!
I mean
a bill.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.351
Look, I'm having
enough trouble
running this island

02:33.420 --> 02:34.953
without a mutiny!

02:35.021 --> 02:37.188
Who told you
that you're running
this island?

02:37.257 --> 02:38.590
I am the skipper!

02:38.659 --> 02:39.858
At sea
you're the skipper!

02:39.927 --> 02:42.860
On land, I am
chairman of the board!

02:42.929 --> 02:44.496
Professor,
will you tell
these people

02:44.565 --> 02:46.030
who is in charge
of this island?

02:46.099 --> 02:47.966
Well, actually,
no one is.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.334
No one?!
No one?!

02:49.402 --> 02:51.202
Good heavens,
this is anarchy!

02:51.271 --> 02:52.704
It is not!
I am in command!

02:52.773 --> 02:54.472
No,<i> I</i> am running
this island!

02:54.541 --> 02:55.907
Gentlemen,
gentlemen.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.042
I've got an idea.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.610
I've got an idea.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.679
Why don't we vote?
You know,
like an election.

03:01.748 --> 03:02.948
An election?

03:03.017 --> 03:03.982
An election!

03:04.051 --> 03:05.617
That's wonderful!
Yes!

03:05.686 --> 03:07.553
I'll spend millions
on my campaign.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.586
That's unfair!

03:08.655 --> 03:10.088
You're right.
It <i> is</i> unfair.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.757
Instead,
I'll buy the votes.
Let me see...

03:21.368 --> 03:23.034
And I know that
it's going to be

03:23.103 --> 03:24.603
a good, clean,
hard-fought battle
right down to the wire.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.238
That's right,
professor.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.706
There's no room
for dirty politics
on this island.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.140
I think we
can always make
a little room

03:29.209 --> 03:30.775
for something
like that,
eh, professor?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.811
Just one thing--
let's get this election
over with

03:32.880 --> 03:34.579
as soon as possible
so we can all get back
to work on the well.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.080
That's fine with me,
professor.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.549
I'm ready
for that election
any time now.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.151
Wait a minute,
captain.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.117
When are you
coming out

03:40.186 --> 03:41.453
of your
smoked-filled hut

03:41.522 --> 03:43.121
and really
face the issues,
huh?

03:43.189 --> 03:44.256
What issues,
Mr. howell?

03:44.324 --> 03:45.957
Well, I'm sure
you'd like to know

03:46.026 --> 03:48.326
what my learned opponent
thinks, for example,
of slum clearance,

03:48.395 --> 03:50.128
of tide land
oil drilling,

03:50.197 --> 03:52.030
of free
school lunches!

03:52.099 --> 03:53.699
I would like
to meet him

03:53.767 --> 03:56.634
in face-to-face debate
on public transportation,

03:56.703 --> 03:59.137
coconut conservation,
and high-rise dwellings.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.772
Now, see here--
now, wait a minute.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.308
You're going to have to
face up to the issues,
captain,

04:03.376 --> 04:05.644
and you better
give them some thought.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.479
In the first place,
who's gonna ask

04:07.548 --> 04:09.481
a lot of stupid
questions like that?

04:09.549 --> 04:10.849
<i> Mrs.</i> howell.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.352
And I beg of you,
dear friends,

04:14.421 --> 04:16.488
do not place
one more burden

04:16.555 --> 04:19.625
on the fragile shoulders
of our dear gallant captain,

04:19.692 --> 04:22.160
who lies sleepless
in his bed at night--

04:22.228 --> 04:26.131
uh, uh, sleepless
in his bed at night,
uh...

04:26.200 --> 04:27.132
Ridden with guilt.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.232
Thank you. Yes. Yes.

04:28.301 --> 04:29.801
Ridden with guilt.
Uh-huh.

04:29.870 --> 04:33.471
Ridden with guilt
about the shipwreck,
which was his fault.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.041
Ridden with guilt
about the loss
of the transmitter,

04:36.109 --> 04:37.675
which was his fault.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.645
Filled with shame
about his lack of qualities
of leadership,

04:40.714 --> 04:42.413
which was
his mother's fault.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.883
What this island needs
is a president like me--

04:45.952 --> 04:50.121
one who is brave, true,
loyal, devoted,
and faithful,

04:50.190 --> 04:52.357
and above all, modest.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.559
And I say to you,
don't change leaders
in mid-ocean!

04:55.628 --> 04:57.662
Elect me first president--

04:57.731 --> 04:59.731
the man who's first
at sea, on land,

04:59.799 --> 05:01.967
and first father
of your island.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.738
That was great,
skipper.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.173
You really think so,
gilligan?

05:08.241 --> 05:10.208
Yeah. Only, can we vote
for George Washington?

05:10.277 --> 05:11.509
George Washington?

05:11.578 --> 05:12.677
Isn't that who you
were talking about?

05:12.745 --> 05:14.913
No, gilligan,
i was talking about me!

05:16.917 --> 05:18.684
Why <i> should</i> people
vote for me?

05:18.752 --> 05:19.751
I don't know.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.418
Well, think!

05:20.487 --> 05:22.086
Uh...Uh...
I got it.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.422
Because you're the
skipper, and you'll
threaten them.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.524
Yeah! Oh, no,
that won't work.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.758
Works with <i> me.</i>

05:27.827 --> 05:29.260
Well, but
you're different.
I am?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.730
Well, certainly.
You're my crew.
I can threaten <i> you.</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:34.732
I've got to woo
the voters.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.334
You don't woo me.
I'd rather
be threatened.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.804
Not you, gilligan!
The girls.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.810
Ginger. Are you home?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.514
[Warmly]
Hello, skipper.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.382
Lovely flowers
for a lovely lady.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.417
Oh, gee,
they're lovely.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.886
Ooh! Those
are the flowers

05:54.955 --> 05:57.189
the professor said
are poisonous.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.356
Poisonous?

05:58.425 --> 05:59.357
Poisonous?!

05:59.426 --> 06:00.859
Yii!
Aaahh!

06:03.430 --> 06:04.496
Shame on you.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.463
Well, what
did I do?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.098
Tried to buy my vote.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.266
Well, I did nothing
of the kind, Mary Ann.

06:09.335 --> 06:11.869
It's
perfectly proper for
a presidential candidate

06:11.938 --> 06:13.437
to want to hire
a secretary.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.607
At $50,000 a year?

06:15.675 --> 06:17.675
Well, good secretaries
are hard to find.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.777
I'm not even
a good secretary,
Mr. howell.

06:19.846 --> 06:22.146
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even a secretary.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.415
I'm only a clerk.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.249
A clerk! Oh, a clerk!

06:25.318 --> 06:26.684
Well, in that case,
100,000.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.587
Uh, group insurance,
uh, fringe benefits.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.790
I am not
going to insult
your intelligence

06:31.859 --> 06:33.691
by attempting
to bribe you.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.494
Gee, Mr. howell,
i don't see

06:35.562 --> 06:37.462
what one thing has
to do with the other.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.696
Are you suggesting
that perhaps

06:38.765 --> 06:40.665
you, uh,
could be bribed?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.503
Everybody says I've
got an open mind.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.537
Ginger,
off this island,

06:46.606 --> 06:48.773
I'm a very wealthy
and important man.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.209
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of
buying Hollywood.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.477
Hollywood?!

06:52.545 --> 06:54.179
Yes. Don't you think
you ought to have

06:54.248 --> 06:56.314
a star on your
dressing room door?

06:56.382 --> 06:58.016
Oh, gee,
Mr. howell...

06:58.085 --> 07:00.118
I mean,
Mr. president...

07:03.223 --> 07:04.156
Gilligan.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.492
[Warmly] Hello.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.161
Who you talking to?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.062
You.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.163
Me?

07:12.232 --> 07:14.432
You're the only one
here, aren't you?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.167
Yeah, but
I'm just me.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.636
I know.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.038
But you've never been
so friendly to me before.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.173
There's always
a first time
for everything...

07:22.242 --> 07:23.508
Isn't there?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.210
I must be dreaming,
huh?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.511
Pinch yourself
and see.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.511
Yeah.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.214
Ow! No, I'm here.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.184
And I just remembered--
I'm campaigning.
Vote for the skipper.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.251
Gilligan?

07:33.320 --> 07:34.786
Yeah?

07:34.855 --> 07:35.453
Come here.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.354
Huh?

07:36.422 --> 07:38.223
Come closer, gilligan.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.193
Gilligan,
would you do me
an extra special favor?

07:42.428 --> 07:44.262
Vote for howell.

07:44.331 --> 07:44.962
[Thud]

07:45.031 --> 07:45.897
Ooh.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.846
"Don't change
skippers."

08:01.915 --> 08:03.515
Oh, gilligan,
get me the paint can.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.749
Yes, sir.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.393
Gilligan, you can't
just walk on the water!

08:15.462 --> 08:17.061
No, skipper,
I'm walkin'
on this board.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.263
See?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.731
Oh. Well,
the board ends there.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.065
Don't step out there.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.234
No, sir.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.802
Oh, Gill--oh!

08:28.375 --> 08:29.640
Gilligan,
my boy,

08:29.709 --> 08:31.509
have you
ever thought
about yourself?

08:31.578 --> 08:33.111
Have I ever
thought what
about myself?

08:33.179 --> 08:33.945
What--what
i mean is, uh,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.446
what you want
to be in life.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.881
Oh, sure. Sometimes
i lie awake at night,
and I think

08:37.951 --> 08:39.885
if I try real hard
and obey the skipper's
orders,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.619
maybe someday
I'll be a junior
petty officer.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.556
Gilligan, how
would you like to be
secretary of the Navy?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.125
Secretary of the Navy?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.493
You gotta be kidding.
I don't even know
how to tie a knot.

08:49.562 --> 08:50.461
You're just
being modest.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.731
No, I'm not. Look.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.066
Well, I mean,
whoever heard

08:56.135 --> 08:57.835
of the secretary
of the Navy tying
his own knots?

08:57.904 --> 09:00.037
I'll assign some
able-bodied seaman

09:00.106 --> 09:01.973
to perform
such menial chores
for you.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.441
Where are we gonna find
an able-bodied seaman?

09:03.509 --> 09:05.643
It--here
comes one now.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.178
Gilligan,
why are you
talking to howell?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.012
I'm sorry,
skipper.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.481
Don't
be afraid,
gilligan.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.149
In a few hours,
he'll be working
for you.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.083
What?!

09:12.151 --> 09:13.084
He means--

09:13.153 --> 09:14.185
what i
mean is, when
i am president,

09:14.253 --> 09:15.120
gilligan
is going to be

09:15.188 --> 09:17.455
secretary
of the Navy.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.423
Secretary of the Navy?

09:19.492 --> 09:20.492
Gilligan is
going to be sec--

09:20.560 --> 09:22.994
[laughing]

09:25.031 --> 09:26.464
Well, why aren't
you laughing, gilligan?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.698
[Laughs]

09:27.767 --> 09:29.601
I was thinking
how nice it would be

09:29.670 --> 09:31.169
to have someone
to tie my shoelaces.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.047
Alright, folks.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.750
7 pieces of paper
have been initialed
by all 7 of us.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.552
These are
the official ballots.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.820
Now think carefully
before marking them,

09:48.889 --> 09:51.322
because what you write
on your ballot counts.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.358
Now, who wants
to vote first?

09:53.427 --> 09:54.859
I do.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.428
Women and children
first, that's
what I stand for.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.528
See what I mean?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.662
Who wants
a president

09:58.731 --> 10:00.631
who would
let children vote?

10:00.700 --> 10:01.733
I'll vote first,
professor.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.034
Ginger,
you're next.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.037
A star is born.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.108
What was
all that about?

10:10.177 --> 10:11.710
Inside joke.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.817
Gilligan, I want you
to get in there
and vote,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.953
but before you do,
i want you
to think about

10:22.022 --> 10:23.555
all the things that
I've done for you.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.755
Aye, aye, sir.

10:24.824 --> 10:25.656
Oh, wait a minute,
gilligan.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.525
On second thought,

10:27.594 --> 10:30.795
maybe you better
not think about
<i> all</i> the things.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.764
Remember, once
you pull that cord,

10:32.832 --> 10:34.599
no man can tell you
how to vote,

10:34.667 --> 10:36.901
Mr. secretary.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.021
Quiet down,
now, everybody.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.656
There you are,
professor.

10:58.725 --> 10:59.890
Gilligan,
you're shivering.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.426
I--I'll be alright
in a m-m-minute.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.795
Alright,

11:03.863 --> 11:06.798
now,
the first ballot...

11:06.866 --> 11:09.700
Is for...

11:09.769 --> 11:10.534
The skipper!

11:10.603 --> 11:11.970
Yay!

11:12.038 --> 11:13.837
This will
keep you warm,
little buddy.

11:13.906 --> 11:16.607
The second ballot...

11:16.676 --> 11:17.575
Is for Mr. howell.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.145
Oh, yay!

11:22.615 --> 11:25.717
Mr. secretary,
warmsy-warmsy.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.285
The third ballot is...

11:27.353 --> 11:28.753
For the skipper!

11:28.822 --> 11:30.822
Who now leads 2 to one.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.823
The fourth ballot...

11:32.892 --> 11:34.559
Is for Mr. howell.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.560
Oh, yippee!

11:36.629 --> 11:38.529
Isn't that exciting?
Now it's 2 all.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.966
The fifth ballot is...

11:42.034 --> 11:45.737
A write-in vote for...

11:45.805 --> 11:47.005
Gilligan?

11:47.074 --> 11:48.306
Let me
see that!
Let me see that!

11:50.276 --> 11:53.377
Why, that's
lovey's handwriting.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.645
Oh, yes, it is.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.947
I decided
that it was time

11:56.015 --> 11:57.849
you let somebody else
run everything.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.584
Then we could
have that honeymoon

11:59.653 --> 12:01.953
you've been promising me
all these years.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.755
Why,
you romantic
schemer, you.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.257
Later. Election.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.327
The vote is tied
at 2 and 2.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.628
And one
for gilligan.

12:10.697 --> 12:11.729
Well, I hardly think
it's necessary

12:11.798 --> 12:12.730
to mention that,
Mary Ann.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.831
Certainly,
Mary Ann.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.501
The sixth ballot
is for...

12:16.569 --> 12:17.468
Gilligan.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.704
Gilligan
is my man, too.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.206
The vote
still stands
at 2 votes

12:21.274 --> 12:22.807
for the skipper
and 2
for Mr. howell.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.742
And 2 write-in votes
for gilligan.

12:24.811 --> 12:28.613
The deciding vote...

12:28.682 --> 12:29.546
Is missing.

12:29.615 --> 12:30.982
Missing?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.883
Oh, yeah.
I've got it
right here.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.085
What's the matter,
gilligan?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.920
Isn't our ballot box
good enough for you?

12:35.988 --> 12:37.588
I was afraid
it might get wet.

12:37.657 --> 12:38.756
That means
that I win.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.158
That means
<i> I'm</i> elected.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.259
I'm sorry,
gentlemen.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.126
You've both lost.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.394
Well, that's
impossible.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.396
Well,
then who is
president?

12:48.634 --> 12:50.201
Gilligan?

12:54.741 --> 12:56.307
President gilligan.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.322
Gilligan,
what are you doing?

13:12.391 --> 13:13.390
I was cleaning up
the white house.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.559
Give me that broom.

13:16.763 --> 13:17.862
Is this
any sort of a job

13:17.930 --> 13:18.629
for the president
to be doing?

13:18.698 --> 13:19.897
I don't know.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.498
I've never been
a president before.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.601
Look, skipper,
i didn't mean
to win the election.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.236
Honest, I was
on your side.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.837
There's no need
to apologize.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.006
I just came
by here to offer
my congratulations.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.674
Now, people have
made their choice,

13:30.743 --> 13:32.410
and whether it's
right or wrong,
we're stuck with it.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.477
Well, maybe we
ought to count
the votes again

13:33.546 --> 13:34.612
to make sure I won.

13:34.681 --> 13:35.947
There's no need
to do that, either.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.748
Howell and i
have counted 'em
4 times already.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.249
Well, I sure
feel awful
about winning,

13:39.318 --> 13:40.685
especially
when I wasn't
even running.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.686
The fact is
you did win, gilligan,

13:42.755 --> 13:44.055
and that's
why I'm here.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.790
I can hardly
call myself a friend

13:45.858 --> 13:47.392
if I didn't give you
a word of warning.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.993
A word of warning?
About what?

13:49.062 --> 13:50.328
The power seekers.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.897
Men who'll seek you out,
call themselves friends,

13:52.966 --> 13:55.032
they'll flatter you,
they'll Fawn on you.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.500
These men are dangerous.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.003
All they want
is a high position
in your government.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.137
These men are
not to be trusted,

14:00.206 --> 14:01.205
and you've got
to guard against them.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.573
Guard against
them? How?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.842
Well, that's
where I come in.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.277
You just
leave it to me.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.379
That's part of my job
as second in command.

14:08.447 --> 14:11.215
I can't tell you who
these men are, but--

14:11.284 --> 14:12.783
here comes
one of 'em now.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.086
I just stopped by
to offer you

14:15.155 --> 14:16.921
my heartiest
congratulations

14:16.989 --> 14:19.223
on your rather
shocking victory.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.825
Yeah, it was kind
of a surprise
to me, too.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.494
Yes, well, the way
i look at it, uh,

14:23.563 --> 14:25.330
could have been worse.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.664
You're finished,
howell.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.865
The president
and I are busy

14:27.934 --> 14:28.966
setting up a new
administration.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.834
Well, that's
exactly why I'm here.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.570
That's exactly
what I thought.

14:32.638 --> 14:33.671
Oh--oh,
Mr. president,

14:33.739 --> 14:34.939
before I,
uh, forget,

14:35.008 --> 14:38.108
here's
a, uh, small but
terribly expensive

14:38.177 --> 14:40.111
little token
of my esteem.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.579
A box of
esteemed tokens.
Thanks, Mr. howell.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.747
No, no, no.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.949
You see, they're
solid gold cuff links.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.084
You--you'll have to
have your wrists pierced.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.219
Mr. howell,
i don't know
how to thank you.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.855
That's what he's
just about to tell
you, gilligan.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.590
Well, I don't
expect thanks.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.958
I came by
to pay my respects

14:54.027 --> 14:55.459
and to offer
my humble service

14:55.528 --> 14:58.329
to whatever high office
the president
might designate.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.397
Howell, I must admit,
I'm surprised
by your attitude.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.067
The leader's wish
is but my command.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.469
Well, then here.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.103
You can start
by cleaning up
the white house.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.405
That ought to be
humble enough.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.939
Just exactly who
do you think you are?

15:09.008 --> 15:10.408
I'm the
vice president.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.776
The vice president.
Well, how did you
get that job?

15:11.844 --> 15:13.944
By getting here
before you did!

15:14.013 --> 15:15.313
Do you want
your cuff links back?

15:15.381 --> 15:16.781
Do you think
I'm the kind of man

15:16.850 --> 15:17.982
who would take back
a bribe, sir?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.250
It's a nice gift.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.484
I could give you
something in return.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.186
Well, I expect to get
something in return.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.322
What exactly
do you have open?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.257
Do you know how
to make a good knot?

15:26.326 --> 15:28.892
Uh, skipper, what
kind of job can we
give Mr. howell?

15:28.961 --> 15:31.094
Well, we have
the secretary
of labor,

15:31.163 --> 15:32.162
the secretary
of defense,

15:32.231 --> 15:33.531
secretary
of state.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.099
Yeah, you could be
one of the secretaries.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.066
You know how to take
shorthand and typing?

15:36.135 --> 15:37.701
No. You see,
Mr. president,

15:37.770 --> 15:39.069
I think with
my background,

15:39.138 --> 15:41.639
the ideal job for me
would be chief justice

15:41.708 --> 15:42.973
of the supreme court.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.508
But that's a very
important position.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.277
Have you had any
legal experience?

15:46.346 --> 15:49.313
The government has
convicted me 6 times
on anti-trust suits,

15:49.382 --> 15:52.583
and I've been
investigated every year
for income tax evasion.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.453
Oh, well, that's
good enough for me.
How about you, skipper?

15:55.521 --> 15:57.889
Well, any man can
stay out of jail with
a record like that's

15:57.958 --> 15:59.323
got to know something
about the law.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.824
Indeed I do.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.027
Now, the first thing
on my agenda...

16:03.096 --> 16:07.097
Is to investigate a plot
to overthrow the government.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.532
What plot to overthrow
the government?

16:08.601 --> 16:11.269
The one I started
right after the election.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.102
Ha ha ha!

16:12.171 --> 16:13.571
See you at
the inaugural luau,

16:13.639 --> 16:14.572
Mr. president.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.276
It is my honor

16:19.345 --> 16:20.444
to introduce to you

16:20.513 --> 16:22.112
a man known
to us all,

16:22.181 --> 16:24.782
a man respected
for his courage,

16:24.851 --> 16:26.117
his dedication
of duty,

16:26.185 --> 16:27.284
his leadership.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.220
A true giant
among men.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.823
Our president,
gilligan!

16:31.891 --> 16:34.625
Yeah,
Mr. president,
bravo, bravo.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.161
Speech, speech.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.063
Ladies and gentlemen
and honored guests,

16:39.132 --> 16:41.165
I accept the
responsibility that
you've given me--

16:41.234 --> 16:43.701
come on, everybody,
eat! Please, while
it's still hot.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.602
Oh, I'm sorry,
gilligan.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.436
I mean,
Mr. president.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.604
That's okay,
folks, uh,

16:46.672 --> 16:47.905
you go ahead
and finish dinner.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.173
I just--i just
jotted down

16:49.242 --> 16:51.942
a few things I wanted
to say, and--

16:52.011 --> 16:53.411
it was right here
a minute ago.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.148
Mr. howell, excuse me,
but that napkin,

16:57.216 --> 16:58.349
I think
it's my speech.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.450
Oh, yes.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.953
First of all--

17:03.022 --> 17:05.122
uh, would you pass me
that guava sauce?

17:05.191 --> 17:06.089
Sure, Mr. howell.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.025
Shot of it,
please.

17:08.094 --> 17:08.826
Thank you.
You're
welcome.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.027
Now...

17:10.096 --> 17:11.429
Would you pass
this down, please?

17:11.497 --> 17:13.262
Thank you.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.099
It's hot.
Here, professor.

17:16.169 --> 17:16.934
Thank you,
gilligan.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.301
You're welcome.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.470
Well, now down to
the important business.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.239
As you all know,
our water supply
is getting short

17:22.308 --> 17:24.241
and we have
to pitch in
and build a well.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.310
Oh, I wish who knew
who cooked these
jellied sand dabs.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.712
Oh, I did,
Mrs. howell.
Do you like them?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.013
Oh, they're
delicious.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.180
Thurston,
you must try them.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.682
You'd believe
you were at Antoine's.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.951
Oh, yes,
you must try my
jellied sand dabs.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.486
Now about
the jellied sand--

17:35.555 --> 17:36.854
I mean, about
digging the well.

17:36.922 --> 17:37.754
Now look, folks,

17:37.823 --> 17:39.123
if we all pitch in,

17:39.192 --> 17:42.026
I figure we can dig
that well in one day--

17:42.095 --> 17:43.427
this is
the best meal
I've had

17:43.496 --> 17:44.895
since I've been
on the island.

17:44.964 --> 17:45.929
Thank you,
skipper.

17:45.998 --> 17:46.930
I've gotta
take a walk.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.134
[All talking]

17:56.309 --> 17:58.308
We have
to have fresh water,

17:58.377 --> 18:00.745
please,
Mr. and Mrs. howell.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.879
Professor, professor,

18:01.948 --> 18:03.314
as secretary
of agriculture,

18:03.382 --> 18:04.948
I think it's necessary
that you should find out

18:05.017 --> 18:06.551
where we
should dig the well.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.426
[Shell sounds]

18:25.438 --> 18:26.670
You rang,
Mr. president?

18:26.739 --> 18:27.871
Yeah, Mrs. howell.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.839
It's almost
after 4:00.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.140
Has anybody come
to see me?

18:30.209 --> 18:31.809
No, they haven't,
Mr. president.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.911
Maybe somebody stopped by
while you were away
from your desk.

18:33.980 --> 18:37.114
I haven't left that
oil drum all day,
Mr. president.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.549
What's my schedule
for tomorrow?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.017
I'll check here.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.285
Well,
there's nothing
in the morning,

18:42.354 --> 18:43.754
but in
the afternoon,

18:43.823 --> 18:45.957
you haven't
got anything.

18:46.025 --> 18:46.857
What time is
my cabinet meeting?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.025
5:00,

18:48.093 --> 18:49.660
but the
vice president
canceled it.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.028
He had
a fishing date

18:51.096 --> 18:52.062
with the
chief justice.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.296
Where's the rest
of my cabinet?

18:53.365 --> 18:55.165
Oh, they're
all swimming
in the lagoon.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.801
All except
the secretary

18:56.869 --> 18:57.801
of health
and welfare.

18:57.870 --> 18:58.603
Good,
what's she doing?

18:58.671 --> 18:59.770
Her hair.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.740
Well, somebody's
gotta dig that well.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.509
You're right,
Mr. president.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.245
You're
absolutely right.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.287
Skipper,
you got a minute?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.788
Sure, gilligan,
come on in,

19:17.857 --> 19:18.855
uh, that is,
Mr. president.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.324
Skipper, I need
your help.

19:20.392 --> 19:21.658
I'm worried.
I'm real worried
about that well.

19:21.727 --> 19:22.693
You look worried.

19:22.762 --> 19:23.861
I do?

19:23.930 --> 19:24.862
You sure do,
and frankly,

19:24.931 --> 19:25.563
I've been worried
about you.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.797
You have?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.065
Yes, but I don't
want you to worry
about that.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.266
You've got enough
to worry about

19:29.335 --> 19:30.634
without worrying
about the way you look,

19:30.703 --> 19:32.202
which is terrible.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.303
Really?

19:33.372 --> 19:34.238
But, gilligan,
never mind that.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.739
Take a look
at this hut.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.642
Now, does this
look like the office
of a vice president?

19:37.710 --> 19:38.976
No, skipper,
it doesn't.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.145
It is beneath
our dignity, isn't it?

19:41.213 --> 19:42.112
Yes, sir,
it is.
Right.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.246
Right.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.181
Now can you help me
with this junk?

19:44.249 --> 19:45.182
Sure,
skipper,

19:45.251 --> 19:46.083
but about
the well.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.084
Skipper?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.719
What seems
to be the problem?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.187
Well, skipper,
our old water supply
is running low,

19:50.256 --> 19:51.621
and we gotta dig
a new well quick.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.591
That's not too heavy
for you, is it?

19:53.660 --> 19:54.391
[Weakly] Uh, no.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.859
Just put this rope
on there,

19:55.928 --> 19:58.129
and, uh, if you
would step over
in the corner here,

19:58.198 --> 20:00.731
we'll put it right
in that corner, that's it.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.999
There we go, gilligan.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.433
About the water
situation, sir.

20:03.502 --> 20:04.935
Oh, you're
having a problem
with the water?

20:05.004 --> 20:07.204
Yeah, skipper,
same problem.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.972
Wait a minute,
gilligan.
Yeah?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.541
I got an idea.
Yeah?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.476
I think I'll put
my desk over here.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.111
Would you bring
this back over and
put it on this wall?

20:14.180 --> 20:15.646
Whatever you
want, skipper,

20:15.714 --> 20:17.414
but we gotta
make a decision
about the well.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.749
Now, uh,
Mr. president,

20:18.817 --> 20:20.250
have you made
any decisions
about the well?

20:20.319 --> 20:21.585
Uh-huh.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.520
And what are you
going to do?

20:23.589 --> 20:25.021
I'm gonna drop
these boxes.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.290
Ooh!

20:26.359 --> 20:27.791
I'm gonna go see
the chief justice...

20:27.860 --> 20:28.826
Oh, gilligan!

20:28.894 --> 20:30.361
About the well.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.601
[Gasps]

20:37.670 --> 20:39.302
I hate to disturb
you, chief justice.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.105
Oh, that's alright.
Never too busy to talk

20:41.174 --> 20:42.273
to the--the president.

20:42.341 --> 20:43.474
I want to ask you
your opinion

20:43.543 --> 20:44.575
about that well
we have to dig.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.610
Oh, the well!
I've been lying here

20:46.679 --> 20:48.646
and giving that
a lot of consideration.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.982
<i> Now, the similar case of</i>
<i> Fletcher vs. Bronson,</i> you see,

20:52.050 --> 20:57.054
the municipal court
upheld a previous ruling
and found for the defendant.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.922
And even after
the case was appealed,

20:58.991 --> 21:00.590
the court refused
to reverse the decision

21:00.659 --> 21:02.425
in spite of the new evidence.

21:02.494 --> 21:05.095
I've taken all of that
into consideration.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.630
What have you
decided to do?

21:06.699 --> 21:10.301
And I've decided to give it
a little more thought.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.036
Nighty night.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.374
Hi. I hate
to barge in like this,

21:17.443 --> 21:18.575
but I figure
maybe you can help me.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.243
I went to see
the vice president first,

21:20.312 --> 21:22.012
but he was so busy
fixing up his office
that he couldn't help me.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.313
And I went to see
the chief justice
of the supreme court,

21:23.382 --> 21:24.649
but he got
a lot of problems, too.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.116
I mean, in the case
of <i> Fletcher and Bronson,</i>

21:26.185 --> 21:27.685
they even had to appeal it,
and it got very complicated,

21:27.754 --> 21:28.919
so I was hoping there was
something you could do.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.887
[Panting]

21:29.956 --> 21:31.555
Well, let me see.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.124
There must be
something I could do.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.626
About--about the well.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.170
Gilligan: I'm gonna
make this meeting
as short as possible.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.872
I know we've
all had a busy day.

21:47.940 --> 21:48.672
[Slurring]
Hear! Hear!

21:48.741 --> 21:49.973
Unless the well is finished,

21:50.042 --> 21:51.375
we're gonna run out
of drinking water.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.110
That's very true,
Mr. president.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.279
We certainly
do need a well!

21:55.348 --> 21:56.614
That's exactly
my thinking, skipper.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.482
And we're behind you
all the way, Mr. president.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.784
You're the best
president we
ever elected.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.284
Thanks, ginger.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.154
I mean, even if
i don't get a star

22:03.222 --> 22:04.922
on my dressing
room door.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.123
Uh, we're
with you, sir.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.925
Well, then how about
helping me dig the well?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.293
Well, I can't
help you, Mr. president.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.894
I'm in the midst
of settling a strike.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.196
What strike?

22:12.265 --> 22:13.564
Oh, the secretary
of health and welfare

22:13.632 --> 22:14.832
won't help me
in the kitchen anymore.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.200
Well,
I'm not on strike.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.768
I have my own
work to do now.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.469
How can i
wash the dishes
and build a hospital

22:19.538 --> 22:20.638
at the same time?

22:20.706 --> 22:22.006
A hospital? What for?

22:22.075 --> 22:23.441
We don't even have a doctor!

22:23.509 --> 22:24.975
Well, but when
the hospital's
finished,

22:25.044 --> 22:26.476
I'm going to build
a medical school.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.878
Don't count on me, sir.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.514
I'm involved
in a very serious
judicial matter.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.149
What are you working
on now, Mr. howell?

22:32.217 --> 22:33.517
Your
impeachment!

22:33.586 --> 22:34.818
What? You're trying
to impeach the president?

22:34.887 --> 22:36.353
On what grounds?

22:36.422 --> 22:40.524
Well, he accepted
a bribe from a power-mad
favor seeker!

22:40.593 --> 22:41.759
I never gave him a dime!

22:41.828 --> 22:43.059
Well, I did!

22:43.128 --> 22:44.795
I gave him a pair
of solid gold cuff links!

22:44.863 --> 22:46.830
That's a pretty
serious charge,
Mr. howell.

22:46.899 --> 22:47.932
Do you have
any witnesses?

22:48.000 --> 22:48.832
Well, I certainly do!

22:48.901 --> 22:49.867
I happen
to have 5 of them!

22:49.936 --> 22:50.834
That's impossible!

22:50.902 --> 22:52.269
I was the only
one in the room

22:52.338 --> 22:53.470
at the time that
he took the bribe!

22:53.539 --> 22:55.706
Aha! There you are!
Thank you very much!

22:55.775 --> 22:58.408
I'm gonna call you
as a witness at
the impeachment proceedings.

22:58.477 --> 22:59.943
What do you want
to impeach a president

23:00.012 --> 23:01.478
that's doing
such a good job for?

23:01.547 --> 23:04.815
Oh, nonsense!
There's no water
down there!

23:04.884 --> 23:06.350
Mr. howell,
i have had it.

23:06.418 --> 23:07.784
You don't
have to impeach me!

23:07.853 --> 23:08.986
I quit!

23:21.667 --> 23:23.266
Quiet down
now, folks.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.969
President gilligan
would like to say
a few words.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.002
Thank you.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.471
First of all,
i want to thank you

23:27.540 --> 23:28.371
for attending
this cabinet meeting.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.773
[All chuckle]

23:29.842 --> 23:31.809
And now that we've
solved the water problem,

23:31.878 --> 23:33.410
I think we
ought to get to work
on our next project:

23:33.478 --> 23:34.911
A lookout tower.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.715
Lookout tower?
That's an excellent
idea, Mr. president.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.850
Oh, you mean
a high-rise
sort of thing?

23:39.919 --> 23:41.585
That sounds
marvelous.
What is it?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.287
If we build
a real tall lookout tower,

23:43.356 --> 23:44.454
a ship or a plane
might spot us,

23:44.523 --> 23:45.589
and we'd be rescued.

23:45.657 --> 23:48.358
[All shout agreement]

23:48.427 --> 23:50.728
We could
be rescued.
Good, good!

23:50.797 --> 23:52.463
Well, I'm glad
you all like the idea.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.432
I have the bamboo poles
and vines right there.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.499
And we can begin
construction right now.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.700
Mr. howell--

23:56.769 --> 23:57.968
no, I have to go,
Mr. president.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.736
A lot of cases
on the docket.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.605
Supreme court
decisions can't
wait, you know.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.706
Mrs. howell?

24:02.775 --> 24:03.841
Uh, I have to go
and take dictation

24:03.910 --> 24:04.708
for Mr. howell.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.776
Professor,
do you think--

24:05.844 --> 24:07.211
I'm sorry,
Mr. president,

24:07.279 --> 24:08.512
I've got
a scientific
report to finish.

24:08.580 --> 24:09.713
Mary Ann?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.181
I think I'd better
check the food supply.

24:11.249 --> 24:12.383
Ginger, do you--

24:12.451 --> 24:14.317
I have to
wash my hair,
gilligan.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.686
Skipper,
do you think--

24:15.755 --> 24:17.555
well, that's just
the idea, Mr. president.

24:17.623 --> 24:18.788
You done some wonderful
things for the island,

24:18.857 --> 24:20.523
and everybody
is behind you 100%.

24:20.592 --> 24:21.691
Oh, I sure hope
i can get reelected.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.960
Oh, I'm sure
you will be!

24:23.029 --> 24:25.395
Ha ha!
Do a good job,
gilligan.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.064
Now, we all...

24:42.214 --> 24:43.681
¶ Now this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

24:43.749 --> 24:45.215
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

24:45.284 --> 24:47.751
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

24:47.820 --> 24:49.786
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

24:49.855 --> 24:51.788
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

24:51.857 --> 24:53.791
¶ will do their very best ¶

24:53.859 --> 24:55.893
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

24:55.961 --> 24:57.928
¶ in the tropic island nest ¶

24:57.997 --> 24:59.229
no phone...
No lights...

24:59.298 --> 25:02.599
¶ No motorcars,
not a single luxury ¶

25:02.668 --> 25:04.734
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:04.803 --> 25:06.837
¶ it's primitive
as can be ¶

25:06.906 --> 25:08.939
¶ so join us here
each week, my friends ¶

25:09.007 --> 25:11.241
¶ you're sure to get a smile ¶

25:11.310 --> 25:13.677
¶ for 7 stranded castaways ¶

25:13.746 --> 25:15.880
¶ here on gilligan's isle ¶

25:16.305 --> 25:22.474
