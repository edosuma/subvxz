        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.571 --> 00:07.506
     I got something to add     
      to the conversation.      

00:07.540 --> 00:09.008
    If a 100-megaton warhead    

00:09.042 --> 00:10.509
    detonated over the city     
        of Boston,              

00:10.543 --> 00:11.844
the results                     

00:11.878 --> 00:12.978
            would be so horrific

00:13.013 --> 00:15.280
    that the survivors          
      would envy the dead.      

00:18.385 --> 00:21.153
    We weren't having           
     a conversation, Cliff.     

00:23.023 --> 00:25.557
  Well! Then food for thought.  

00:25.625 --> 00:27.092
      (theme song begins)       

00:31.297 --> 00:33.565
    ¶ Making your way

00:42.976 --> 00:46.812
      ¶ Wouldn't you like       
         to get away? ¶         

00:47.914 --> 00:50.849
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go ¶  

00:50.884 --> 00:54.853
    ¶ Where everybody

01:39.699 --> 01:40.966
        Hi, guys.               

01:41.034 --> 01:42.334
Hey, there he is!               
                      All right,

01:42.435 --> 01:43.669
                 a star is born!
            The man of the hour.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.137
    Oh, Woody!                  

01:45.171 --> 01:47.439
 Woody, you opened last night   
in <i>Arsenic and Old Lace.</i>        

01:47.474 --> 01:49.608
Why didn't you tell me          
so I could go?                  

01:49.642 --> 01:51.610
      I did tell you, Miss Howe.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.512
            I told you dozens   
                  of times and I

01:53.580 --> 01:55.247
          sent you an invitation
                    with a cute,

01:55.281 --> 01:56.782
                  little cartoon
              of me drawn on it.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.417
            You said you were   
            going to be there   

01:58.451 --> 02:00.352
        and I reserved a seat   
    for you in the front row.   

02:00.420 --> 02:03.155
    Oh!                         

02:03.189 --> 02:05.858
Then I was sick.                

02:07.527 --> 02:09.193
                  Oh, I'm sorry.
         Are you feeling better?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.630
Hmm, so-so.                     

02:13.133 --> 02:15.467
        Well, it's probably best
     you didn't come last night.

02:15.502 --> 02:16.869
         I've still got         
    to iron out a few bugs.     

02:17.003 --> 02:18.037
                          CLIFF:
                 Well, all I can

02:18.071 --> 02:19.872
tell you, Woody,                
is that Ma loved the play.      

02:19.906 --> 02:21.507
Yeah, I mean, there's           
something about the idea        

02:21.541 --> 02:23.776
of sweet old ladies being       
cold-blooded murderesses.       

02:23.810 --> 02:26.245
Just seemed to tickle her       
          funny bone.           

02:26.279 --> 02:27.446
            (laughs)            

02:27.480 --> 02:29.848
        All the way home        
 she just laughed and laughed.  

02:29.883 --> 02:32.518
        Matter of fact,         
    I woke up at 3:00 a.m.,     

02:32.585 --> 02:35.387
and there she was sitting in my 
    room in a rocking chair     

02:35.422 --> 02:37.656
    rocking back and forth,     
         staring at me          

02:37.691 --> 02:41.126
      and making this low,      
    guttural chuckle.           

02:41.161 --> 02:43.095
Boy, does she love the theater. 

02:44.764 --> 02:46.331
        Hi, guys.               

02:46.366 --> 02:48.167
                     Carla, your
                 psychic called.

02:48.201 --> 02:51.003
    Madame Lazora called me?    

02:51.037 --> 02:52.838
  Yeah, she's coming by today.  

02:52.872 --> 02:55.874
  Madame Lazora is coming by?   

02:55.909 --> 02:58.677
      Maybe she just wants      
         to say hello.          

02:58.712 --> 03:00.479
      Oh, no, no, no, no.       

03:00.513 --> 03:01.580
     You don't understand.      

03:01.614 --> 03:04.483
     Madame Lazora does not     
        just say hello.         

03:04.517 --> 03:07.353
  She must have had a horrible  
premonition of me getting       

03:07.387 --> 03:09.488
      hurt or killed or...      

03:09.522 --> 03:11.056
          or pregnant.          
                            Hmm.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.493
     Look, Carla, if you're     
really concerned what this      

03:14.527 --> 03:16.829
     charlatan has to say,      
  why don't you just call her?  

03:16.863 --> 03:18.097
Yeah, you're right, Doc.        

03:18.131 --> 03:19.965
I might as well just            
get it over with.               

03:21.534 --> 03:22.601
Wait a minute.                  

03:22.669 --> 03:24.370
What if she was calling me      

03:24.404 --> 03:27.339
    to warn me to keep away     
        from telephones?        

03:27.374 --> 03:29.274
    What if she's seen          
         a vision of me         

03:29.309 --> 03:31.877
      horribly disfigured       
    in a telephone accident?    

03:33.146 --> 03:34.813
            Carla, don't        
        be ridiculous.          

03:41.221 --> 03:42.488
                Woody, you okay?

03:42.522 --> 03:44.790
    Oh, I don't know,           
         Mr. Peterson.          

03:44.858 --> 03:45.858
        Uh, this is bad.        

03:45.892 --> 03:47.192
        I can't breathe.        

03:47.227 --> 03:48.761
         I can't move.          

03:48.795 --> 03:50.696
Hey, Woody, your review is out. 

03:50.764 --> 03:51.797
            It is?!             

03:51.831 --> 03:53.799
    Oh, boy! Oh, boy!           

03:53.833 --> 03:55.334
    I can't wait to read it!    

03:55.368 --> 03:57.636
        I'm gonna make copies   
        and send them to my mom!

03:59.205 --> 04:01.206
        Oh, here, here.         
Here you read it, Mr. Peterson. 

04:01.241 --> 04:02.841
     I'm too nervous.           

04:05.512 --> 04:07.146
            Well, he likes it!  

04:07.180 --> 04:08.580
      Hey!                      
              "A charming romp."

04:08.682 --> 04:10.315
                     "A charming
                          romp"!

04:10.350 --> 04:12.217
    He likes the cast.          
    "A deft ensemble."          

04:12.252 --> 04:14.053
         Ooh, good!             
                "Deft ensemble."

04:14.087 --> 04:15.587
Uh, what does                   
he say about me?                

04:15.622 --> 04:17.589
          And he sort           
    of goes on and on.          

04:19.024 --> 04:20.993
      No, no, go ahead, read it.
                  I can take it.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.899
     "Woody Boyd is weak."      

04:28.968 --> 04:32.471
"Weak"? Is that all?            

04:32.572 --> 04:34.440
          Not handsome and weak?

04:37.043 --> 04:39.011
        Well, Woody, you know   
                  what they say,

04:39.045 --> 04:41.046
     "There's no such thing     
          as bad press          

04:41.081 --> 04:42.748
     as long as they spell      
    your name right."           

04:42.782 --> 04:46.885
Actually, it says               
"Woody Doyb is weak."           

04:52.425 --> 04:54.293
    Oh, Madame Lazora.          

04:54.327 --> 04:56.462
  I sense the tortured anguish  

04:56.496 --> 04:59.465
    of many lost souls          
     screaming for release.     

04:59.499 --> 05:00.466
Uh, that's probably me.         

05:00.500 --> 05:02.801
I had kielbasa                  
for breakfast.                  

05:05.138 --> 05:06.538
                  Madame Lazora,
                    let me go   

05:06.606 --> 05:08.374
 get Carla; she's gonna want to 
      see you right away.       

05:08.408 --> 05:09.541
  She's been kind of worried.   

05:09.576 --> 05:11.510
 I sensed she would be worried. 

05:11.544 --> 05:13.145
            How did she know?   

05:13.179 --> 05:14.146
            Amazing.            

05:14.180 --> 05:15.314
(burps)                         

05:15.348 --> 05:17.149
        Oh, Carla.              

05:17.183 --> 05:18.951
Darling, I must talk to you.    

05:18.985 --> 05:19.985
        Please sit down.        

05:20.020 --> 05:21.086
Sam, just stay with me.         

05:21.121 --> 05:22.321
I'm really scared.              
        All right. Okay.        

05:22.355 --> 05:23.555
     All right, here we go.     

05:23.590 --> 05:25.791
Just tell me it's going         
to be quick and painless.       

05:25.825 --> 05:27.393
             I don't understand.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.195
You don't foresee a hideous     
disaster in my future?          

05:30.263 --> 05:32.998
             Of course I do, but
        that's not why I'm here.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.335
Oh, then why?                   

05:36.369 --> 05:38.137
        I have decided to retire

05:38.171 --> 05:40.239
             and move to Florida
         at the end of the year.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.008
                    I see myself
                  on Miami Beach

05:43.043 --> 05:45.844
             with those muscular
                    cabana boys.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.247
    See? I told you there's     
    nothing to worry about.     

05:48.281 --> 05:50.449
"Nothing to worry about"?       

05:50.483 --> 05:52.084
     Madame Lazora has been     

05:52.118 --> 05:54.687
my spiritual advisor            
since I was 17 years old.       

05:54.721 --> 05:56.789
Without her my life would've    
been a complete disaster.       

05:56.823 --> 05:57.956
    Honey, I thought your...    

05:57.991 --> 05:59.558
Well, it could                  
have been worse.                

06:00.960 --> 06:02.728
Sam, you're                     
smothering me here.             

06:02.762 --> 06:04.196
Get the lady a drink.           
                 You...         

06:04.230 --> 06:06.298
        I'd like a beer, please.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.267
Oh, wow, she read my mind.      

06:12.038 --> 06:13.572
Madame Lazora,                  

06:13.606 --> 06:15.741
         if you retire,         
what am I supposed to do?       

06:15.775 --> 06:17.109
Who am I going to turn to?      

06:17.143 --> 06:18.777
    Who are all your clients    
    going to turn to?           

06:18.812 --> 06:19.978
                You.            

06:20.080 --> 06:22.448
     And why me?                

06:22.515 --> 06:25.784
          Because Princess Katya
            said it would be so.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.720
Princess Katya said that?       

06:27.787 --> 06:28.954
(gasps)                         

06:29.055 --> 06:31.090
Sam, did you hear that?         

06:31.124 --> 06:34.326
Princess Katya has              
chosen me to take over          

06:34.361 --> 06:35.928
for Madame Lazora.              
              Ah.               

06:35.962 --> 06:37.129
  Well, who's Princess Katya?   

06:37.330 --> 06:38.764
She's Madame Lazora's           

06:38.865 --> 06:39.965
spirit guide.                   

06:40.000 --> 06:41.633
Her contact                     
from the other side.            

06:41.701 --> 06:46.271
 Katya, she was a 17th-century  
    Romanian princess,          

06:46.306 --> 06:48.640
         very much misunderstood
                     in her day.

06:48.708 --> 06:52.277
 The villagers hammered a mask  
    lined with spikes           

06:52.312 --> 06:54.346
  onto her face and burned her  
         at the stake.          

06:54.381 --> 06:57.916
  And to this day, that woman   
still keeps her sense of humor. 

06:59.552 --> 07:01.086
     Well, you, you've got      
        to admire that,         

07:01.121 --> 07:02.154
        don't you?              

07:03.423 --> 07:06.658
Princess Katya thinks           
I have spiritual gifts?         

07:06.726 --> 07:07.793
                She knows.      

07:07.894 --> 07:09.495
                    And tonight,

07:09.562 --> 07:12.531
                  when I return,
                 all the secrets

07:12.565 --> 07:14.500
             of the spirit world
        will be revealed to you.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.035
        Well, why can't         
      we start right now?       

07:16.069 --> 07:18.103
                I have to get   
            my teeth cleaned.   

07:18.138 --> 07:20.673
    We all have many lives,     
but only one set of teeth.      

07:24.377 --> 07:26.945
 Whoa! I'm gonna be a psychic!  

07:26.980 --> 07:28.747
 Who could have predicted that? 

07:31.251 --> 07:33.652
         (Carla sighs)          

07:33.687 --> 07:35.454
     I guess I better start     
          practicing.           

07:36.523 --> 07:37.923
Sam, I'm going                  
to read your mind.              

07:37.957 --> 07:39.925
Okay? Think of something.       
                      Right now?

07:39.959 --> 07:41.460
Yeah.                           
                     Okay.      

07:41.494 --> 07:43.028
                          CARLA:
                        Okay.   

07:44.364 --> 07:45.964
You're thinking                 
about your car.                 
                    Nope.       

07:48.034 --> 07:49.468
You're thinking                 
about some babe.                

07:49.502 --> 07:50.769
                     Nope.      
Oh, wait a minute.              

07:50.804 --> 07:52.271
Give me a minute.               
I can do this.                  

07:52.305 --> 07:53.706
          Just give me a chance.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.007
                    (sighs)     

07:55.041 --> 07:56.375
                 You're thinking
                about your hair.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.976
      Nope.                     

07:58.011 --> 07:59.278
                Come on, Sam,   
            that's everything   

07:59.312 --> 08:00.612
        you ever think about!   

08:02.315 --> 08:03.682
That's not true.                
I think about other things.     

08:03.817 --> 08:05.084
                Yeah? Like what?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.251
Well, I was thinking            
about what happened             

08:06.286 --> 08:07.653
at the end                      
of <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>          

08:07.687 --> 08:09.488
I fell asleep.                  

08:09.522 --> 08:11.990
        Uh, uh, Sammie,         
             Chuck Heston       

08:12.025 --> 08:14.560
    found the decayed ruins     
of the Statue of Liberty.       

08:14.627 --> 08:16.662
      What are you saying?      

08:16.696 --> 08:19.365
      You're saying he was      
on Planet Earth the whole time? 

08:19.399 --> 08:20.332
             Whoa!              

08:23.503 --> 08:25.571
Man, I wasn't even close.       

08:25.605 --> 08:27.072
I guess I'm just                
fooling myself.                 

08:27.107 --> 08:30.042
What a prize dork,              
thinking I had the power.       

08:30.076 --> 08:31.110
                    Oh, come on,
                 just 'cause you

08:31.144 --> 08:32.378
                didn't get it   
                 the first time?

08:32.412 --> 08:33.645
     Come on, let's do it again.
What's the use?                 

08:33.679 --> 08:35.481
            Come on, I wasn't   
                  concentrating.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.715
  We both weren't concentrating.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.150
        Now, let's-- come on,   
                    let's do it.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.385
Okay. I'm going                 
to do it one more time.         

08:41.554 --> 08:43.288
Just... you've got              
to just relax though,           

08:43.323 --> 08:44.423
        Sam, okay?              

08:44.457 --> 08:45.591
                 All right, mmm.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.993
I see something.                

08:48.028 --> 08:49.828
    It's you.                   

08:49.863 --> 08:51.330
And you're young.               

08:51.364 --> 08:53.265
And, uh, it's summer.           

08:53.299 --> 08:55.601
And there's an animal, a pet.   

08:55.669 --> 08:57.236
You had a pet,                  
didn't you, Sam?                

08:57.303 --> 08:58.604
              Yeah, yeah, I did.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.873
And you loved him very much.    

09:00.907 --> 09:02.007
        Yeah, I did love him.   

09:02.042 --> 09:05.010
Suddenly this is                
all so clear!                   

09:06.980 --> 09:09.782
      Frasier, I see you,       

09:09.816 --> 09:11.316
        as a young boy,         

09:11.351 --> 09:14.219
    reading all those books     
  and not having any friends.   

09:19.993 --> 09:22.795
        Norm, I see you,        

09:22.829 --> 09:25.664
having lots of friends          
and not reading any books.      

09:28.501 --> 09:31.136
And, Cliff, I see you.          

09:31.171 --> 09:32.571
(shudders)                      

09:36.409 --> 09:38.210
         Sam. Sam, there's more.
Yeah?                           

09:39.946 --> 09:41.647
                     That pet...

09:41.681 --> 09:44.883
                 It's a Labrador
                  named Sparkey!

09:44.918 --> 09:46.952
    And he's running to a woman.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.487
            It's your mother!   

09:48.521 --> 09:50.089
        Her black hair is waving

09:50.123 --> 09:51.457
in the wind!                    
Oh, my God!                     

09:51.591 --> 09:53.325
          This is so incredible!
    Huh?!                       

09:53.360 --> 09:54.927
    Madame Lazora was right!    

09:54.961 --> 09:56.228
          I am gifted!          

09:56.262 --> 09:57.529
          I am a seer!          

09:58.698 --> 10:00.499
                Marry that girl.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.269
         Quit that job!         

10:04.304 --> 10:06.939
    I have the power!           

10:11.077 --> 10:12.978
How do you explain              
that, Dr. Crane?                

10:13.046 --> 10:15.581
  Why ask me, Woody? I mean...  

10:15.615 --> 10:17.483
      Do I know something       
    that no one else knows?     

10:17.517 --> 10:19.485
I mean, we all saw              
what we saw.                    

10:21.221 --> 10:23.288
            I mean, do you enjoy
            having me explain   

10:23.323 --> 10:24.757
              every little thing
                that happens?   

10:24.791 --> 10:26.658
You know, I mean,               

10:26.693 --> 10:28.394
                  "Let's ask the
             esteemed Dr. Crane.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.461
         Yeah, see, he'll know."

10:29.496 --> 10:30.729
         Well, I'm sorry, Woody.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.031
    I have no answer for you!   

10:32.098 --> 10:35.267
Frankly, I'm,                   
I'm downright scared.           

10:35.301 --> 10:37.936
To tell the truth, I got,       
I got a little creeped out      

10:37.971 --> 10:39.471
 when she got that dog's name.  

10:39.506 --> 10:41.306
             Frasier, Frasier...

10:41.341 --> 10:42.775
                 Calm down, man,
                      I, I lied.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.443
              I just didn't want
        to hurt her feelings.   

10:44.477 --> 10:45.811
                  I knew that.  

10:47.514 --> 10:49.248
                 Sam, can I have
                    a, a scotch?

10:59.926 --> 11:00.926
         Oh, excuse me.         

11:01.027 --> 11:02.728
        I'm-I'm looking         
        for Woody Boyd.         

11:02.796 --> 11:03.662
                         Oh, no!

11:03.697 --> 11:04.863
    What is it?                 

11:04.898 --> 11:07.766
It's my director,               
Lee Bradken.                    

11:07.834 --> 11:09.068
Uh, is Woody Boyd here?         

11:09.102 --> 11:10.769
        WOODY (quietly):        
     Tell him I'm not here.     

11:10.804 --> 11:12.771
                  I'm sorry, Mr.
         Bradken, he's not here.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.007
How did you know                
my name was Bradken?            

11:15.041 --> 11:16.775
             WOODY:             
 Tell him it was a lucky guess. 

11:16.810 --> 11:17.943
                    Lucky guess.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.145
Who's that person               

11:20.180 --> 11:22.915
crouching by the side           
of your leg?                    

11:22.949 --> 11:26.051
             WOODY:             
     Okay, give me a minute     
          on this one.          

11:29.622 --> 11:31.290
Woody, what do you mean         

11:31.324 --> 11:33.525
by saying you're not going      
to do the show tonight?         

11:33.560 --> 11:34.793
        Okay, I'm sorry,        
          Mr. Bradken.          

11:34.828 --> 11:36.228
    You're too smart for me.    

11:36.262 --> 11:38.864
      Not that my partner       
     gave me a lot of help.     

11:41.067 --> 11:44.603
          It's just, I read that
    scathing review, and I...   

11:44.637 --> 11:46.972
            I just don't think I
        can face an audience.   

11:47.040 --> 11:49.608
I'm not saying your performance 
        was weak, Woody,        

11:49.642 --> 11:52.111
  but if it was-- and it was--  

11:52.145 --> 11:54.813
then maybe,                     
that's because, as an actor,    

11:54.848 --> 11:58.050
    you're afraid to examine    
    your-your own feelings.     

11:58.084 --> 12:00.452
Here, I want you                
to do an exercise.              

12:00.487 --> 12:03.088
Write down                      
your true feelings              

12:03.123 --> 12:05.824
as they come                    
to you, okay?                   

12:05.859 --> 12:09.895
Now, how do you feel            
right now?                      

12:09.929 --> 12:11.930
                    I feel weak.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.301
Not what other people           
tell you to feel.               

12:16.336 --> 12:17.936
    Do you really feel weak?    

12:17.971 --> 12:20.773
                  I feel strong.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.142
      Darned right you do.      

12:23.176 --> 12:25.210
And how do you feel             
about that critic?              

12:25.245 --> 12:26.478
                    Am angry.   

12:26.546 --> 12:28.647
So? How are you gonna get even? 

12:28.682 --> 12:30.949
                TP his house.   

12:34.120 --> 12:35.521
              No.               

12:35.555 --> 12:37.756
 By giving the best performance 
         you can give.          

12:37.791 --> 12:40.359
Look, I talked the critic       
into coming back tonight, Woody.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.927
If you can change his mind,     

12:41.961 --> 12:43.495
he'll say so                    
in tomorrow's column.           

12:43.563 --> 12:46.999
  Now, Woody, how do you feel   
    about going on tonight?     

12:47.033 --> 12:49.101
                     Feel great!

12:49.135 --> 12:51.236
      And how do you feel       
about your fellow actors?       

12:51.271 --> 12:53.138
                  Am better than
                other actors.   

12:54.774 --> 12:56.508
Well, Woody...                  

12:56.543 --> 12:57.976
            Can direct better   
                than Bradken.   

12:58.011 --> 13:00.145
Hey, hey, hey,                  
hey, hey!                       

13:00.180 --> 13:02.114
        You've still got        
    a long way to go.           

13:02.148 --> 13:03.816
I'll see you tonight.           

13:06.286 --> 13:09.755
    "Is jealous of my youth     
        and good looks."        

13:14.427 --> 13:16.328
  Guys, it's gonna be so cool   

13:16.396 --> 13:18.530
     being a spiritualist.      

13:18.565 --> 13:20.866
                        REBECCA:
                             Oh.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.067
                     Poor Carla.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.469
It's gonna break her heart      

13:23.503 --> 13:25.838
when she sees                   
that she can't read the future. 

13:25.872 --> 13:27.840
            Well, she must be   
             able to, Miss Howe.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.342
         She filled out her time
        card for the whole week.

13:30.377 --> 13:35.080
    She's gonna work 80 hours   
         between now and Friday!

13:35.115 --> 13:37.116
                  That is eerie!

13:39.119 --> 13:41.820
Are you ready to receive        
the spirit of Princess Katya?   

13:41.855 --> 13:43.422
                You bet I am.   

13:43.456 --> 13:46.258
            I can't wait to quit
             this penny-ante job

13:46.292 --> 13:48.160
    and start doing something   
            I'm more suited for.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.862
Excellent. Now,                 
all we need                     

13:49.896 --> 13:52.731
is a nice, quiet, dark place    
where we won't be disturbed.    

13:52.766 --> 13:54.366
          No problem. I'll clear
            out the poolroom.   

13:54.401 --> 13:55.901
        Good.                   

13:55.935 --> 13:58.704
        Hey, isn't that Michelle
            Pfeiffer out front?!

13:58.738 --> 14:00.506
     (overlapping chatter)      

14:01.875 --> 14:04.076
             And who's she with,
                 Kevin Costner?!

14:04.110 --> 14:05.744
                         Where?!

14:05.779 --> 14:07.713
            Where?!             

14:11.551 --> 14:12.718
          Hey, Sammy?           

14:14.187 --> 14:15.220
                Catch you later.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.522
                    When you see
                    me again,   

14:16.556 --> 14:17.923
          I'm gonna be          
on a higher astral plane.       

14:18.058 --> 14:19.024
Yeah, wait.                     

14:19.059 --> 14:20.926
         Come... Wait.          
     Hold on a second here.     

14:20.960 --> 14:23.095
You're not... You're not serious
about quitting Cheers, are you? 

14:23.129 --> 14:25.464
Because if you are...           
                No, you don't   
                have to tell me.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.132
                      I can read
                      your mind.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.735
              You're afraid that
         we're gonna grow apart,

14:29.769 --> 14:31.570
             and we're not gonna
             be friends anymore,

14:31.604 --> 14:33.305
                    because I'll
                be a psychic,   

14:33.340 --> 14:35.040
                 and you'll be a
                lowly bartender.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.476
Honey, you remember when        
you-you were reading my mind?   

14:37.510 --> 14:40.612
Well you-you didn't get         
as much right as you thought.   

14:40.647 --> 14:42.581
                  Oh, yeah? What
                did I get wrong?

14:42.615 --> 14:44.850
Everything.                     

14:44.884 --> 14:47.586
                  But everything
                was so clear!   

14:47.620 --> 14:50.456
             Well, okay, maybe I
          didn't read your mind,

14:50.523 --> 14:52.391
            but I was definitely
        reading somebody's mind,

14:52.425 --> 14:54.560
because those images            
were as clear as day.           

14:54.594 --> 14:55.961
                 Come on, Carla.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.163
Okay. All right.                

14:58.198 --> 15:00.566
Who here had a mother           
with black hair                 

15:00.600 --> 15:03.002
and a Labrador retriever?       

15:05.505 --> 15:06.739
        Come on!                

15:06.773 --> 15:08.807
I can't be the only one!        

15:08.842 --> 15:10.776
Oh!                             

15:15.548 --> 15:16.982
                (sing-songy):   
                          Carla!

15:17.017 --> 15:19.151
                  Princess Katya
              and I are waiting.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.587
Madame Lazora,                  
I-I can't do this.              

15:21.621 --> 15:25.257
I'm sorry, but I am just not    
cut out for this kind of stuff. 

15:25.291 --> 15:26.425
              Are you telling me

15:26.459 --> 15:28.260
             that Princess Katya
            and I are wrong?!   

15:28.294 --> 15:29.528
I'm telling you that            

15:29.562 --> 15:31.497
                I don't have any
                 psychic powers.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.365
                I mean, I tried!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.501
 Problem is, you have no faith, 

15:35.535 --> 15:38.303
    and without faith,          
    you are not worthy          

15:38.338 --> 15:40.272
      to house the spirit       
    of Princess Katya.          

15:40.306 --> 15:43.709
I had such high hopes           
for you,                        

15:43.743 --> 15:46.245
     but now you're nothing     
  but an empty disappointment.  

15:46.279 --> 15:47.646
    Farewell forever, Carla!    

15:47.681 --> 15:51.483
        (in deep voice):        
         Lazora, <i>halt!</i>          

15:51.518 --> 15:53.519
                I am Princess   

15:53.553 --> 15:55.054
             Katya.             

15:55.088 --> 15:58.390
    I am inside Carla.          

16:00.160 --> 16:02.227
        (normal voice):         
              Oh!               

16:02.262 --> 16:03.796
         What happened?         

16:03.830 --> 16:06.198
Carla, you had faith,           
and it happened!                

16:06.232 --> 16:07.966
                It did?!        

16:08.001 --> 16:09.368
            I did it!           

16:09.436 --> 16:11.570
                I did it!       
Yes! Yes!                       
You're a natural!               

16:11.604 --> 16:14.073
And more and more, you will     
be able to see the spirits      

16:14.107 --> 16:15.474
of the dead are                 
all around you!                 

16:15.508 --> 16:18.844
And very soon, you will see them
lingering in the shadows        

16:18.878 --> 16:21.013
            of this very bar,   
                just as I do.   

16:21.047 --> 16:24.116
         Oh. That's just Lilith.
    Everyone makes that mistake.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.250
              Oh.               

16:29.789 --> 16:34.860
All the tools you will need     
are here in this carved box.    

16:34.894 --> 16:39.531
Precious crystals--             
windows to the unseen future.   

16:39.566 --> 16:44.236
The tarot cards--               
ancient diviners of fortune.    

16:44.304 --> 16:46.705
The I Ching coins--             

16:46.740 --> 16:48.774
symbols of Oriental wisdom.     

16:48.808 --> 16:51.710
The moist towelettes.           

16:51.745 --> 16:54.847
You get a lot of trade          
off the street in this business.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.015
     (door bells tinkling)      

16:56.049 --> 16:57.182
                            MAN:
                Hello? Hello?   

16:57.217 --> 16:58.851
         (door closes)          
          What's that, a spirit?

16:58.885 --> 17:01.286
No, no, no. That's Bob,         
your first client.              

17:01.354 --> 17:03.555
I'll never forget               
my first client.                

17:03.590 --> 17:05.190
                     Who was it?

17:05.224 --> 17:07.259
    Bob.                        

17:07.292 --> 17:10.095
            Madame Lazora, I-I'm
    really not ready for Bob.   

17:10.130 --> 17:11.430
Oh, don't worry.                

17:11.464 --> 17:12.731
I'll be here with you.          

17:12.766 --> 17:15.233
  There's just one more piece   
         of information         

17:15.268 --> 17:17.435
  you need to fully understand  
    your mission here.          

17:17.503 --> 17:19.805
            Look, Madame Lazora,
        you don't understand.   

17:19.839 --> 17:21.940
            I have a terrible   
             confession to make.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.576
                Back in the bar,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.945
        Princess Katya didn't   
        really enter my body.   

17:27.981 --> 17:31.950
    I was just faking it so that
      I wouldn't disappoint you.

17:31.985 --> 17:34.019
                I don't have any
                 psychic powers.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.688
      I am just an awful person.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.755
I hope you don't hate me.       

17:36.790 --> 17:39.358
                  Oh, Carla, I'm
                 so proud of you

17:39.392 --> 17:41.393
          for having the courage
        to be honest with me.   

17:41.428 --> 17:43.629
                Oddly enough,   
                    this relates

17:43.663 --> 17:45.497
            to the information I
          was about to give you.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.433
    What's that?                

17:47.500 --> 17:48.967
        I'm a complete fraud.   

17:49.002 --> 17:53.472
    Now, we just have time to   
      work on your spooky voice.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.606
    What?                       

17:54.708 --> 17:55.674
              Your <i>spooky</i> voice.

17:55.709 --> 17:58.210
            You have to learn   
                to speak lower--

17:58.244 --> 18:01.447
talk more                       
from the diaphragm.             

18:01.481 --> 18:03.449
                 You're a fraud?

18:03.483 --> 18:06.085
          All these years you've
             been leading me on?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.686
              Hi.               

18:07.721 --> 18:10.622
Oh, hello, Bob.                 

18:10.657 --> 18:13.625
I want you to meet              
your new spiritual advisor--    

18:13.660 --> 18:15.694
      Madame Carla.             

18:15.762 --> 18:17.262
      Hello, Madame Carla.      

18:17.330 --> 18:19.598
          Hello, Bob.           

18:20.567 --> 18:23.602
Madame Carla...                 

18:23.636 --> 18:25.771
study Bob's aura.               

18:27.240 --> 18:28.974
Tell me,                        

18:29.009 --> 18:30.676
what do you see?                

18:30.744 --> 18:33.178
                     Can you see
                      something?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.614
Yeah, I can see something.      

18:35.648 --> 18:37.616
I can see that you're a sucker, 

18:37.650 --> 18:38.984
a big dope.                     

18:39.052 --> 18:41.153
             For 20 years you've
            been forking over   

18:41.187 --> 18:44.390
        your hard-earned cash   
         to a sleazy con artist.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.458
     You have been taken in     
        by the cheapest,        

18:46.493 --> 18:48.327
 most obvious scam in the world 

18:48.361 --> 18:50.162
    just because you wanted     
         to believe it.         

18:50.196 --> 18:54.366
         I see that you         
     should wise up, chump.     

18:54.434 --> 18:56.201
(door closes)                   

18:56.302 --> 18:58.604
That will be $50, please.       

19:10.350 --> 19:12.117
Yow, I wonder what's wrong      
          with Carla.           

19:12.152 --> 19:13.719
          (chuckling):          
    We all know what's wrong    
          with Carla,           

19:13.753 --> 19:15.854
      but I'm the only one      
 with enough courage to say it. 

19:15.889 --> 19:17.089
        Not enough bran.        

19:17.123 --> 19:19.091
         (Cliff yelps)          

19:21.561 --> 19:22.728
        Hey, everybody.         

19:22.796 --> 19:24.563
    Hey, Woody, how'd it go?    

19:24.631 --> 19:26.832
        Oh, it was              
a great performance, Sam,       

19:26.866 --> 19:28.067
  and I actually got a chance   

19:28.101 --> 19:30.135
        to talk to that         
    critic afterward,           

19:30.170 --> 19:33.339
and he said that                
I was much improved.            

19:33.373 --> 19:34.273
                Well.           
                There you go.   

19:34.307 --> 19:35.341
SAM:                            
Well, I can't wait              

19:35.375 --> 19:36.775
    to go see you next week.    

19:36.810 --> 19:39.945
     Oh, well, no, actually     
  I'm not in it anymore, Sam.   

19:39.979 --> 19:41.213
         What happened?         

19:41.247 --> 19:45.117
  Well, the other actors read   
my notebook and got upset.      

19:45.185 --> 19:48.187
          Well, Woody,          
 people can be very sensitive.  

19:48.221 --> 19:49.822
  Well, I think they're being   
    a little oversensitive.     

19:49.856 --> 19:50.956
  I mean, come on, Dr. Crane,   

19:50.990 --> 19:52.257
      I mean, if you read       
         in my notebook         

19:52.292 --> 19:54.293
    that you were a snobby,     
      know-it-all windbag,      

19:54.327 --> 19:55.627
      would you be upset?       

19:55.662 --> 19:57.596
          Yes, I probably would.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.264
              Oh.               

19:59.299 --> 20:00.699
          (page tears)          

20:02.869 --> 20:06.538
    (playing "Greensleeves")    

20:09.542 --> 20:12.311
I guess someone ought           
to go talk to Carla, huh?       

20:13.780 --> 20:15.714
                    Allow me.   

20:25.458 --> 20:27.993
Carla, would you like           
to talk about it?               

20:28.028 --> 20:28.994
                No.             

20:29.029 --> 20:30.629
Well, then,                     
would you like me               

20:30.663 --> 20:33.499
to show you the correct         
fingering for "Greensleeves"?   

20:35.068 --> 20:36.702
            She's a fake.       

20:36.736 --> 20:38.504
                Madame Lazora   
                     is a fraud.

20:38.538 --> 20:42.641
        All these years she's   
        been nothing but a fake.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.710
I am sorry, Carla.              

20:44.744 --> 20:46.545
I don't suppose this            
is an appropriate moment        

20:46.579 --> 20:48.213
  to say "I told you so."       

20:48.248 --> 20:50.849
         No, this is the perfect
            moment to say it.   

20:50.884 --> 20:53.385
     I told you so.             

20:53.420 --> 20:54.853
             I can't believe it.

20:54.888 --> 20:57.523
I know I can, but then          
again, I did tell you so.       

20:57.557 --> 21:00.426
            All right, just give
          me a minute to wallow.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.761
I'm sorry.                      

21:02.796 --> 21:04.963
                      I mean, if
                she's a fake,   

21:04.998 --> 21:07.132
    then everything's a fake    

21:07.167 --> 21:10.102
         and everything         
  I ever believed in is wrong.  

21:12.105 --> 21:14.373
    I guess that's it.          

21:14.407 --> 21:15.441
     I've got nothing left.     

21:15.475 --> 21:17.176
        Game over.              

21:17.210 --> 21:21.847
Carla, Madame Lazora            
is just one individual.         

21:21.881 --> 21:22.915
Don't give her                  
the power                       

21:22.949 --> 21:24.717
to destroy                      
your entire belief system.      

21:26.820 --> 21:28.887
You know,                       
the mystic world                

21:28.922 --> 21:33.158
that's given you so much        
comfort may very well exist.    

21:33.193 --> 21:34.760
 You don't really believe that. 

21:34.794 --> 21:36.395
Of course I do.                 

21:36.429 --> 21:38.297
Although if, if it doesn't      

21:38.331 --> 21:41.967
I-I'm logging in right now      
to say "I told you so."         

21:43.069 --> 21:46.538
The truth is,                   
no one knows.                   

21:46.573 --> 21:48.707
    What's your point?          

21:48.742 --> 21:52.544
That you should profit          
from this experience.           

21:52.579 --> 21:54.880
You've graduated                
from Madame Lazora.             

21:54.914 --> 21:56.749
You've become                   
a stronger Carla--              

21:56.816 --> 21:58.851
a smarter Carla--               
one who's learned.              

21:58.885 --> 22:00.753
                You want to know
              what I've learned?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.521
                    I've learned
                    that a woman

22:02.555 --> 22:05.624
     with a funny voice and some
        fancy scarves can charge

22:05.692 --> 22:07.893
any stupid idiot 50 bucks       

22:07.927 --> 22:10.562
        just to tell him        
     what he wants to know.     

22:12.332 --> 22:14.033
              Hey.              

22:14.067 --> 22:15.100
    What is it, Carla?          

22:15.301 --> 22:17.670
         I got a scarf.         

22:20.206 --> 22:23.208
        (in deep voice):        
    I can do a spooky voice.    

22:23.276 --> 22:24.777
        Now, now, Carla.        

22:24.844 --> 22:27.880
                  Gather around,
                      everybody,

22:27.914 --> 22:31.417
          and I will tell you of
        the future for 50 bucks.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.018
        Carla, no.              

22:33.053 --> 22:33.919
                You're right.   

22:33.953 --> 22:35.621
                60 bucks.       

22:35.689 --> 22:38.424
                  Gather around,
                  gather around.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.359
                Thanks, Fras.   

22:42.128 --> 22:44.630
            Well...             

22:44.664 --> 22:47.700
 I guess my work here is done.
