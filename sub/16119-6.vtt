00:04.405 --> 00:09.977
*

00:10.010 --> 00:11.545
Would you like a drink
while you wait?

00:11.579 --> 00:14.215
Uh, yeah, just a little
more water, please.

00:14.248 --> 00:21.222
*

00:30.231 --> 00:31.999
* La la la la la la

00:32.032 --> 00:39.006

00:39.039 --> 00:41.109
* La la la la la la

00:41.142 --> 00:42.610
Van.

00:42.643 --> 00:46.947
*

00:46.980 --> 00:49.283
(whispering)
Hi, baby.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.019
How are you?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.254
Oh, it's good to see you.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.288
Oh, you too, honey.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.623
You smell good.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.858
-What is that?
-It's Boucheron.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.293
Oh, okay.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.294
I'm gonna try that.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.596
It smells good.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.598
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-No, no, no.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.900
I know you're a working girl.
Don't worry, it's fine.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.970
(giggles)

01:10.003 --> 01:11.739
It's good to see you.
You look really good.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.707
Oh, thank you.
You too.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.276
-Yeah, I like your hair.
-Really?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.877
-Yeah, yeah, it's cute.
-Thanks.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.212
Looks better than
the last time.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.281
Did you go to that shop
I told you to go to?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.649
-Fernando's?
-No.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.451
I went to this place
that I found in Midtown.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.119
Yeah, you should've
went to Fernando's.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.920
Girl, I'm telling you,
he's the best.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.222
He's the best.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.391
-He will fix those roots.
-Hmm.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.760
-Mm-hmm.
-How much does Fernando charge?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.329
-Oh, well, he ain't cheap.
-Okay.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.631
Well, who's paying for yours?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.000
Because I actually
have to pay for mine.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.569
Van, come on.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.937
Come on.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.174
I don't know if you remember
what that's actually like.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.108
Okay, okay.
Okay.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.477
Good evening, ladies.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.078
Can I get you
anything else to drink?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.080
Yeah, actually,
I would like some wine maybe.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.582
Like a Chardonnay.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.684
Why don't we do, like,
a bottle of something?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.252
Do you have something sweet?

01:58.286 --> 01:59.753
-Riesling's good.
-Okay, yeah.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.322
Let's do a bottle of that.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.957
Van, good? Great.
Okay.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.626
-Are you two ready to order?
-Yeah, um...

02:05.659 --> 02:07.295
-I mean, I am, if you are.
-Yeah, it's fine.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.929
I just didn't
want to hold us up.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.431
No, it's fine,
don't worry about it, go ahead.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.132
I'm gonna have
the pad Thai with chicken.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.601
-Excellent.
-Okay.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.969
And, um, I'll go ahead
and do the snapper

02:16.003 --> 02:17.137
and snake bean salad.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.672
-Great choice.
-Yup, great.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.973
-Thanks.
-Be right back.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.675
Thank you.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.477
Oh, Van.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.348
(both laugh)

02:27.381 --> 02:29.116
I'm so glad
I got to catch you.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.618
Yeah, I know.
I know.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.853
-When do you leave tomorrow?
-9:00.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.121
-Oh.
-Yeah.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.023
Damn, that's a short trip.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.025
When did you get in?
You got in, what, yesterday?

02:38.058 --> 02:40.394
-No, day before yesterday.
-You flew Delta?

02:40.428 --> 02:42.363
No, private.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.032
-Oh.
-(laughs)

02:45.065 --> 02:46.367
I mean, yeah.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.202
Yeah, but it wasn't, like,
the nice p.j.,

02:48.236 --> 02:50.238
it was like one of
those rent-a-p.j.'s.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.572
I'm leaving on Delta, though.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.006
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.375
Where you gonna go?
You gonna go home?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.310
Uh, no well, back to New York,

02:56.344 --> 02:57.645
check out this
apartment I like

02:57.678 --> 02:59.146
and then to London.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.648
-London?
-Yep.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.516
-Wow.
-Yeah.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.685
And you're gonna go
with a friend, or--

03:04.718 --> 03:08.021
No, just a special
NBA player friend.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.657
Okay.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.925
I got it, but it's not
the same NBA player...

03:11.959 --> 03:13.694
-Oh, no, girl.
-That you're visiting here?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.263
No, mm-mm, no.
Mm-hmm.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.565
I mean, London's okay,
I guess.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.233
Just too much rain.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.101
Makes my hair frizzy.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.070
Oh, but I love Paris.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.438
Girl, have you been?

03:24.472 --> 03:25.673
I went last month.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.841
Look, let me show you.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.109
Okay, look, look.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.713
There I go in Versailles,
looking like...

03:32.746 --> 03:34.382
looking like
black Marie Antoinette.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.183
(laughs)

03:36.216 --> 03:38.085
It's beautiful.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.787
-Yeah.
-You look beautiful.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.555
You know, you should
come with me next time.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.956
-Girl.
-It'll be fun.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.525
-It'll be fun!
-I have a daughter.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.459
-I can't leave.
-Oh.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.194
That's cute.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.897
You know, sometimes I wish
I had a kid, but then I'm like,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.766
ugh, God no.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.902
You know, I guess when the time
is right, I'll have a kid.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.470
Yeah, I'm sure.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.372
I'm sure as soon as
you find the right guy.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.740
*

03:59.773 --> 04:02.109
-Yeah, the right guy.
-Mm-hmm.

04:02.142 --> 04:05.145
I guess.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.481
-So how have you been?
-So, how's your mom?

04:07.515 --> 04:10.384
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.752
You go, I'm sorry.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.288
How've you been?
I haven't seen you.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.657
I'm, um, I'm busy.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.125
-Yeah?
-I'm busy.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.560
I'm good.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.895
Well, you look great.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.931
-You do, I'm serious.
-Thank you.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.999
Oh, I ran into
Kerry Clopton.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.468
You remember her,
from fifth grade?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.069
- Yeah.
-You know, the girl.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.139
She look like she got a rake
dragged across her face.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.774
(laughs)

04:33.807 --> 04:36.243
On Facebook, it said
she was in a car accident.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.814
*

04:40.848 --> 04:42.650
Here we are.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.752
You know,
can I actually get

04:44.785 --> 04:46.420
some chopsticks
when you get a chance?

04:46.454 --> 04:47.821
-Um...
-Of course.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.691
Yeah, I don't think
we got any.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.926
-Chopsticks?
-What?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.528
Thai people don't use
chopsticks.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.129
(laughs)

04:56.163 --> 04:57.531
I mean, well,
Americans think they do

04:57.565 --> 04:59.433
because they're Asian,
but they don't.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.702
-I just like chopsticks.
-Oh, okay.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.804
Okay.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.139
So what are you doing
after this?

05:06.173 --> 05:09.309
This dude I know, he's having
some, like, listening party--

05:09.343 --> 05:11.812
It sounds cool, but I can't.
I have Lottie.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.314
Oh, come on, Grandma.
Come on, it'll be fun.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.483
I also have work
in the morning.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.050
Yeah, and I have a flight.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.686
-Look, call Earn...
-I'm not calling Earn.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.953
And then have--why?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.889
I don't know, he's busy.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.025
Yeah, I see his Snapchat
sometimes, and he looks...

05:25.058 --> 05:28.829
he looks busy.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.330
Wait, are you...

05:30.364 --> 05:32.332
are you still seeing him?

05:32.366 --> 05:34.001
We have a daughter.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.904
I mean, I still go out, but--
is he living with you?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.872
When he can afford to, yes.

05:38.906 --> 05:42.543
Mmm.
(giggles)

05:42.576 --> 05:44.745
Y'all are funny.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.180
You two are funny.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.882
(laughs)

05:48.916 --> 05:50.350
Oh, okay.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.319
I mean, you used to make fun
of girls like you.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.222
You realize that, right?

05:55.255 --> 05:57.090
No, I'm serious, Van.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.427
You know, you really need
to think about your value.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.663
-I'm sorry?
-Like, what is your value?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.097
Wait, what are you
asking me right now?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.165
Like, why are you
messing around

06:05.198 --> 06:06.166
with this broke-ass nigga?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.935
-Whatever.
-Van.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.903
I know what my worth is.
I don't want to be out here

06:09.937 --> 06:11.739
dating a million football
players--that's your style.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.240
Hey, hey, look.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.509
Women need to be valuable.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.078
Black women
have to be valuable.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.747
Come on, the NBA players
I fuck with,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.381
they fuck with me because
I provide a service,

06:21.415 --> 06:23.617
and I am worth it.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.286
I am cultured, intelligent,
and beautiful.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.688
And that is hard--Van!

06:27.721 --> 06:30.924
Look at me.
That is hard to come by.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.127
That kind of black and white
mentality might work for you,

06:34.161 --> 06:36.797
but for those of us who don't
live on whether a linebacker

06:36.830 --> 06:38.432
-swipes left or right...
-That's not what I'm talking--

06:38.466 --> 06:40.868
On my goddamn ass,
then there's a gray area.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.103
Stop, Van, he's running
around on you, girl.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.072
-Oh, so what?
-What you mean, "So what"?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.307
So what? You don't think
that I'm going out on dates?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.976
You don't think
that I'm running around?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.711
You don't think that I ever
decline his calls

06:50.744 --> 06:52.312
because I have some guy
wrapped around me

06:52.345 --> 06:53.380
with his tongue down my throat?

06:53.413 --> 06:56.049
I mean, come on!
Really?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.319
("The Masquerade"
by George Benson)

06:59.352 --> 07:01.054
Here we go.

07:01.088 --> 07:06.794
*

07:06.827 --> 07:08.496
Enjoy.

07:08.529 --> 07:15.503
*

07:22.843 --> 07:27.014
* Are we really happy here

07:27.047 --> 07:31.118
* With this lonely game
we play *

07:31.151 --> 07:33.687
*

07:33.721 --> 07:38.358
* Looking for words to say

07:38.391 --> 07:39.693
(camera shutter clicks)

07:39.727 --> 07:44.097
*

07:44.131 --> 07:47.768
* Searching but not finding

07:47.801 --> 07:50.771
Oh, Kevin's here.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.606
-Wait, what?
-Kevin's here.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.974
He's taking us
to the listening launch.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.208
Jayde.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.810
He's got a friend
for you, too.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.945
Cute.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.613
(laughs)

07:59.647 --> 08:01.281
-Hey, baby, how you doing?
-Wait, what?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.850
-Hey, boo.
-Come on, sit down.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.818
-This is my boy, CJ.
-Hey.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.854
-How's it going?
-Hi.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.188
Dang, you looking good.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.658
- You too.
-Well, listen.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.459
-Um, y'all finished, though?
-Yeah.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.127
'Cause we're gonna get ready
and get out of here.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.696
-I'll take the check.
-Okay.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.064
So, hey, sweetheart.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.899
What's your name?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.300
Vanessa.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.336
Vanessa.
Okay, okay.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.138
Well, you're looking beautiful.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.807
I'm talking fine
like shine, girl.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.242
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
okay?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.844
Wait, wait, you're gonna take
your jacket to the bathroom?

08:30.878 --> 08:31.879
Mm-hmm.

Hi.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.005
I'm sorry.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.773
Van, I'm sorry.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.942
I just wanted to hang out
with my girl tonight,

09:01.975 --> 09:03.343
and I messed up.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.712
I did, okay?
I know I did.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.113
I'm sorry,
please don't leave.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.715
It's fine,

Come on, let's just go to
this listening party

09:09.316 --> 09:11.184
for, like, five minutes.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.087
I told you,
I don't feel like it.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.355
It'll be like old times.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.590
Exactly.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.125

in old times,

09:18.158 --> 09:20.527

with the uglier dudes?

Oh, my God.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.364
Okay, CJ is not that bad.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.199
Seriously, I mean,
yeah, he's like--

09:26.233 --> 09:28.268
he's like a lawyer
or something.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.370
I think.
(laughs)

09:30.403 --> 09:32.706
I'm more valuable
than that shit.

Hold on.

Okay, your whole life

-I have a drug test today.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.627
Girl, you smoked yesterday.

-Girl, I'm being serious!
-Me, too.

I don't know
the protocol for this.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.166
I never had a job where
smoking wasn't encouraged.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.268
I don't know,
can you ask someone?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.237
Yeah, let me ask
a friend from the Hawks.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.239
I mean, they get tested,
and he smokes nonstop.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.341
Can you hurry? Because I got
to be at work in two hours.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.475
I'll hurry, all right?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.644

How's Jayde?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.060
She's good.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.864

You don't have to do that.

an extra hour of sleep in?

14:33.974 --> 14:37.277
Oh, uh, is it business?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.812

set up that meeting, you know?

aren't going anywhere, though.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.359
* Hit it

19:19.392 --> 19:21.027
* Good God hit it and quit it

19:21.060 --> 19:23.396
*

19:23.430 --> 19:24.397
* You can shake it

19:24.431 --> 19:25.498
Van.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.633
Alicia, hey.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.235
You running ISS today?

19:28.268 --> 19:31.804
Uh, yes, I'm supposed to.
Yeah.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.072
I got Tobias right now.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.741
You want to know
what this boy did?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.843
-Jamilah Hall?
-Here!

19:36.876 --> 19:38.845
-Forrest Hunt?
-Here.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.548
Tobias Walner?

19:41.581 --> 19:42.849
Tobi--

19:42.882 --> 19:45.785
(indistinct chatter)

19:49.922 --> 19:52.191
-Why was he in white face?
-I don't even know.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.860
But he gonna get enough
of fucking with me.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.528
-I know that.
-Um...

19:55.562 --> 19:57.897
Okay, just send him to
Mr. Halford 'cause he loves him.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.566
Somebody needs
to come get him.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.768
I can't do it, Van;
I'm not going to jail today.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.937
Bring Mr. Halford down, and he
will walk him to ISS, okay?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.606
Girl, I got to go.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.208
He gonna get enough.
Watch.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.064
Okay.
Just...

20:36.002 --> 20:38.938
(heartbeat thumping)

20:44.243 --> 20:47.146
(heartbeat continues thumping)

20:54.086 --> 20:56.055
(groans)

20:56.088 --> 20:57.424
Ugh!

20:57.457 --> 21:00.360
(heartbeat continues thumping)

21:04.263 --> 21:06.032
(school bell rings)

21:07.300 --> 21:10.202
(heartbeat continues thumping)

21:13.606 --> 21:16.242
(balloon pops)

21:16.275 --> 21:17.810
Fuck!

21:22.281 --> 21:23.516
(intercom buzzes)

21:23.550 --> 21:24.951
Vanessa's here.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.786
Please send her in.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.991
Morning, Ms. Keifer.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.160
I wanted to have
a quick chat with you.

21:34.193 --> 21:37.029
-I didn't receive your sample--
-I smoked weed.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.867
Okay.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.170
Well, urine samples
aren't sent off.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.105
The county can't afford
quarterly drug tests

21:46.138 --> 21:49.308
for its employees,
so after the first one,

21:49.342 --> 21:52.879
they're really just to keep
people on their toes.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.948
Listen, everybody smokes weed.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.351
The system isn't made
for these kids to succeed,

21:58.385 --> 22:00.620
and you got to
shake it off somehow.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.522
-I get it.
-(sighs)

22:04.591 --> 22:06.826
But unfortunately,
you have admitted the use

22:06.859 --> 22:08.961
of an illegal substance
to a superior,

22:08.995 --> 22:11.898
so I've got to fire you.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.733
To cover my own ass,
as well as the school's.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.202
You understand.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.237
Okay, let's say we had
this conversation Friday.

22:18.270 --> 22:23.543
That'll give you the week to
get your things together, okay?

22:23.576 --> 22:26.813
You all right?

22:26.846 --> 22:29.582
Come here.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.718
Yeah, you are.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.486
Whoo!

22:33.520 --> 22:36.188
You are loud.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.625
I mean,
it's all in your hair.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.424
(cell phone buzzes)

23:23.436 --> 23:25.438
(school bell rings)

23:29.676 --> 23:31.110
Hey, Mike.
