00:01.016 --> 00:04.183
(soft dramatic music)

00:13.205 --> 00:15.836
(birds singing)

00:15.836 --> 00:19.003
(soft dramatic music)

01:48.294 --> 01:50.503
- Oh my gosh, are you okay?

01:50.503 --> 01:53.670
(soft dramatic music)

01:55.592 --> 01:56.675
Are you hurt?

01:57.789 --> 01:59.293
What happened? Are you okay?

02:00.190 --> 02:03.357
(soft dramatic music)

02:10.360 --> 02:12.160
We're gonna get you some help, okay?

02:13.298 --> 02:15.423
(soft dramatic music)

02:15.423 --> 02:17.640
I was just jogging right off the highway.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.023
I found this boy. Please send someone.

02:21.023 --> 02:24.190
(soft dramatic music)

02:28.118 --> 02:29.158
I was just running.

02:29.158 --> 02:31.075
- What's going on here?

02:32.881 --> 02:35.142
What's your name, young man?

02:35.142 --> 02:38.389
(soft dramatic music)

02:38.389 --> 02:40.442
Do you know who you are?

02:40.442 --> 02:43.776
(speaking indistinctly)

02:59.209 --> 03:02.042
(switch clicking)

03:06.474 --> 03:09.952
(soft dramatic music)

03:09.952 --> 03:12.619
(glass humming)

03:18.553 --> 03:20.720
(banging)

03:21.940 --> 03:25.273
(footsteps approaching)

03:26.410 --> 03:28.050
- What do you have, dog ears?

03:28.050 --> 03:29.124
You're gonna have to--

03:29.124 --> 03:30.790
- Your cash is in here too.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.433
- Okay, well, see you tomorrow?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.765
- Ella, unmute my phone,
play my voicemails.

03:39.765 --> 03:40.740
- [Ella] Voicemail, one.

03:40.740 --> 03:41.640
- [John] Hey, it's John.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.137
The marketing meeting was moved up a week,

03:43.137 --> 03:44.579
and our deadline right along with it,

03:44.579 --> 03:47.070
so we're gonna need the
tuning fork recordings pronto.

03:47.070 --> 03:49.730
It's critical we get
those demo videos ready.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.770
Call me.

03:50.770 --> 03:51.603
- Delete.

03:51.603 --> 03:53.450
- [Ella] Deleted, voicemail two.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.430
- [Barb] Hi, this is Barb Wilson.

03:55.430 --> 03:58.010
Max said that you are
the sounds effects guy.

03:58.010 --> 04:00.279
I have a project that
needs your expertise.

04:00.279 --> 04:01.112
- Save.

04:01.112 --> 04:02.780
- [Ella] Saved, voicemail three.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.633
- [Alan] Hey, kid, it's me.

04:05.670 --> 04:09.090
I need closure on this,
and I haven't heard back.

04:09.090 --> 04:10.921
I know you don't like visitors, okay?

04:10.921 --> 04:11.754
- Delete.

04:11.754 --> 04:13.333
- [Ella] Deleted, no more voicemail.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.617
(soft piano music)

04:38.854 --> 04:40.670
- [Alex] Mom?

04:40.670 --> 04:41.503
Mom?

04:42.590 --> 04:43.863
When's dinner?

04:45.250 --> 04:47.560
- [Martha] Trudy picked
up her wedding dress.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.630
The back ripped, and all
the beads, they fell out.

04:50.630 --> 04:52.290
I'm sorry, honey.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.290
She needs it first thing in the morning.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.130
- [Alex] Can we have taquitos?

05:00.440 --> 05:02.870
- [Martha] Listen, honey,
grab some money outta my purse

05:02.870 --> 05:05.200
and run on down to the corner
and get yourself something,

05:05.200 --> 05:06.930
and bring me a, um--

05:06.930 --> 05:08.119
- A Diet Coke.

05:08.119 --> 05:10.452
- [Martha] Diet Coke, okay?

05:10.452 --> 05:11.828
- Poor Trudy.

05:11.828 --> 05:14.332
- [Ella] Window, window.

05:14.332 --> 05:15.788
- Stop the alarm.

05:15.788 --> 05:17.672
- [Ella] Alarm stopped.

05:17.672 --> 05:20.839
(soft dramatic music)

06:04.172 --> 06:07.089
(knocking on door)

06:12.136 --> 06:13.880
- [Winters] Impeccable timing.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.713
- Hey, Boss.

06:14.713 --> 06:17.001
- I told you I'm not your boss.

06:17.001 --> 06:17.834
- Yeah, you are.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.840
Technically, I have over
100 different bosses

06:20.840 --> 06:22.340
in this building.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.210
- But only the miserly
landlord, Harris, pays you.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.740
Therefore, you only have one boss.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.080
- Miserly.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.909
Penny pincher, tightwad, cheapskate.

06:32.909 --> 06:33.743
- Bingo.

06:34.710 --> 06:35.543
- In here?

06:41.411 --> 06:42.970
(soft dramatic music)

06:42.970 --> 06:46.813
Just a small leak, but I fixed it for you.

06:48.830 --> 06:52.140
No, not again, I'll get fired.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.430
- You're not gonna get fired.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.310
I have enough dirt on Harris
that you're safe forever.

06:56.310 --> 07:00.110
- If he finds out, he'll get
so angry. He's vindictive.

07:00.110 --> 07:02.163
- Unforgiving, vengeful?

07:05.300 --> 07:07.390
Suit yourself.

07:07.390 --> 07:09.313
I'll just return it then.

07:10.870 --> 07:14.790
- Does that have a 1983 stamp date

07:15.640 --> 07:18.123
and an inner tray with matching thermos?

07:23.120 --> 07:24.853
No scratches on the edges.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.610
Holographic graphics.

07:28.610 --> 07:32.013
According to my collector's
manual, this one's rare.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.330
Do you want me to put
the bug in the air vent?

07:37.330 --> 07:39.430
- Wherever you think is best. I trust you.

07:41.969 --> 07:44.670
- The new couple, in 102.

07:44.670 --> 07:45.995
Blonde, male, five-foot-10--

07:45.995 --> 07:48.050
- Yeah yeah, I don't care
about all that, okay?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.113
Only how they sound.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.110
- Do you wanna see where
I put my other lunchboxes,

07:53.110 --> 07:54.873
and my poster collection?

07:54.873 --> 07:56.783
- Okay, you know I can't leave this room.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.970
- Because of what's wrong with you?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.100
- Thanks for the sink.

08:07.891 --> 08:11.058
(soft dramatic music)

08:27.115 --> 08:30.397
(footsteps descending)

08:30.397 --> 08:33.563
(soft dramatic music)

08:46.452 --> 08:49.165
(exhaling)

08:49.165 --> 08:51.748
(door closing)

08:56.400 --> 08:58.567
(sighing)

08:59.820 --> 09:00.930
- [Gordon] You know how she is.

09:00.930 --> 09:03.052
- [Becky] She's freaking
out over what happened.

09:03.052 --> 09:04.114
- [Gordon] I'm sure.

09:04.114 --> 09:05.777
- [Becky] Imagining shit
that never happened.

09:05.777 --> 09:07.710
And you know what? She believes it too.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.092
- [Gordon] You're right.
Someone needs to go talk to her.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.730
- [Becky] Yeah, you need to do it.

09:11.730 --> 09:14.030
- Me?
- Yes, you, yes.

09:14.030 --> 09:15.530
- Why can't Manny go talk to her?

09:15.530 --> 09:19.040
- Gordon, you're the only one
with the balls for the job.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.593
Expect Manny to do it?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.850
When's the last time he
did anything worthwhile?

09:24.850 --> 09:26.135
- [Christine] Things are
different between us.

09:26.135 --> 09:27.930
- [Scott] Why do we keep going over this?

09:27.930 --> 09:29.717
- [Christine] Can we just talk about this?

09:29.717 --> 09:30.550
- [Scott] There's this thing at work.

09:30.550 --> 09:32.321
I'm under a lotta stress.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.515
- [Christine] You're being so distant.

09:33.515 --> 09:34.348
- [Scott] If you can't trust me,

09:34.348 --> 09:36.670
that's you sabotaging our relationship.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.573
- Wow, don't let him do that.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.396
Don't apologize. He's cheating
on you, and you know it.

09:42.396 --> 09:43.447
- [Christine] Please--

09:43.447 --> 09:45.025
(knocking on door)

09:45.025 --> 09:46.725
- [Scott] Maybe I should just go.

09:47.726 --> 09:50.309
(upbeat piano music)

09:52.840 --> 09:54.896
- Hey, sorry to interrupt.

09:54.896 --> 09:55.729
- Interrupt what?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.923
- Oh, it sounded like you had company.

09:59.180 --> 10:02.547
Anyway, do you have any
ice? My fridge is out.

10:06.976 --> 10:09.559
(door closing)

10:14.810 --> 10:16.140
- You should have Leonard
check that out for you.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.133
- Check what out?

10:18.430 --> 10:20.390
- Isn't your fridge broke?

10:20.390 --> 10:21.543
- Oh yeah, thanks.

10:22.819 --> 10:23.652
- Rosie?

10:27.824 --> 10:31.741
(upbeat classical piano music)

10:38.415 --> 10:42.415
(muffled shouting through wall)

10:50.816 --> 10:53.983
(soft dramatic music)

10:57.096 --> 10:58.929
- [Shawn] Fucking bitch!

11:00.181 --> 11:02.138
Where did you put my fucking money?

11:02.138 --> 11:04.888
Why do you have to act like this?

11:07.392 --> 11:11.392
(muffled shouting through wall)

11:12.761 --> 11:15.633
You are worthless! You are nothing!

11:15.633 --> 11:19.550
(upbeat classical piano music)

11:28.135 --> 11:31.216
(soft dramatic music)

11:31.216 --> 11:33.490
- [Maggie] Did you get help?

11:33.490 --> 11:35.990
(piano music)

11:42.211 --> 11:44.961
(piano breaking)

11:58.847 --> 12:02.680
(singing in foreign language)

12:51.258 --> 12:54.258
(doorknob jiggling)

13:05.271 --> 13:07.650
- Huh, I love what
you've done to the place.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.660
Did you get my message?

13:08.660 --> 13:11.563
- Yeah, something, something closure.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.790
- Uh, this is, uh--

13:14.790 --> 13:16.270
- Sh.

13:16.270 --> 13:19.053
- This is yours. Marie
wanted you to have it.

13:26.393 --> 13:27.823
Do you wanna see what it is?

13:27.823 --> 13:31.801
- Don't touch that, okay.
Everything has its place.

13:31.801 --> 13:32.634
Okay.

13:36.780 --> 13:39.290
- You know, Marie got sick a year ago.

13:39.290 --> 13:41.480
Four months ago, she
went into the hospital.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.730
Eight weeks ago, I put her in the ground.

13:43.730 --> 13:44.863
Where the hell were you?

13:44.863 --> 13:46.440
- I can't do this right now.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.620
- All that progress and
you just threw it away

13:48.620 --> 13:50.243
when she needed you the most.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.010
I must have been a fool, you know,

13:53.010 --> 13:55.233
to think that maybe you loved her.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.290
Wait wait wait, let me guess.

13:58.290 --> 14:01.100
Because of your retrograde amnesia,

14:01.100 --> 14:04.123
you couldn't remember whether
you gave a damn or not.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.410
You know what?

14:06.410 --> 14:10.363
Now that she's gone, me and
you, we're done, for good.

14:12.340 --> 14:13.173
- Alan?

14:18.235 --> 14:20.280
One of my neighbors, she plays the piano.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.940
She practices every
afternoon from four to six,

14:22.940 --> 14:24.780
except weekends and Saturdays,

14:24.780 --> 14:27.330
she'll play once in the
morning after breakfast

14:27.330 --> 14:28.580
and once at night around six.

14:28.580 --> 14:29.413
Sunday, she plays--

14:29.413 --> 14:30.850
- What do you want?

14:30.850 --> 14:32.000
- Someone destroyed it.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.800
The piano, late last night.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.710
I just need you to go knock on
her door, see if she answers.

14:39.710 --> 14:42.130
And that's all. It's Room 607.

14:42.130 --> 14:44.330
- You're really worried
about your neighbor?

14:46.440 --> 14:49.130
- By this time today, she'd
have practiced already.

14:49.130 --> 14:51.580
She'd be out of the shower,
blow-drying her hair.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.380
- How do you know that?

14:53.380 --> 14:55.250
You know what? Call the cops.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.083
- No.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.240
- Well, great, do it yourself, kid.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.980
- I'd have to leave this
room. I can't do that.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.380
- Whew, bye-bye.

15:02.380 --> 15:03.430
- There's more, okay.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.253
Whoever destroyed it, left this playing.

15:09.462 --> 15:10.990
(operatic singing in foreign language)

15:10.990 --> 15:15.990
Alan, when I heard it, I saw something.

15:17.230 --> 15:20.340
But I didn't just see it, I remembered it.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.393
It was a memory.

15:22.410 --> 15:25.213
I think it was from before
that day Marie found me.

15:26.270 --> 15:29.122
Okay, I need you to go over there.

15:29.122 --> 15:31.343
I just need you to see
what the hell's going on.

15:33.810 --> 15:35.857
- I will not enable you like she did.

15:37.627 --> 15:39.630
And don't expect any more gigs from me,

15:39.630 --> 15:41.520
because from now on I'm using Paul.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.870
- That hack!

15:42.870 --> 15:43.703
- What?

15:44.730 --> 15:47.360
- Fine, fine. Use Paul, I don't care.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.963
But that music.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.073
I saw this door.

15:53.284 --> 15:54.330
- Are you still taking your meds?

15:54.330 --> 15:56.250
- Someone knew I'd be
listening, I know it.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.470
- I said, are you still taking your meds?

15:59.470 --> 16:00.303
- What?

16:00.303 --> 16:01.571
- Not what. Answer me, are
you still taking your meds?

16:01.571 --> 16:02.988
- Yes, yes, I am!

16:03.913 --> 16:08.496
(operatic singing in foreign language)

16:15.067 --> 16:18.515
- Hey hey hey, is this what I think it is?

16:18.515 --> 16:20.060
(soft dramatic music)

16:20.060 --> 16:21.763
These are apartment numbers.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.043
You've been taping your neighbors'
apartments, haven't you?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.930
Just to feed that sick fetish of yours.

16:30.930 --> 16:32.760
That's how you know what
the hell they're up to.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.800
- They may not be relationships to you,

16:34.800 --> 16:37.863
but to me, they are my family.

16:38.963 --> 16:39.820
- Huh.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.100
Wow, hey I'm really happy

16:42.100 --> 16:44.310
that you're surrounded by your family,

16:44.310 --> 16:46.840
while the woman who devoted
her goddam life to you

16:46.840 --> 16:48.910
wasted away and died!

16:48.910 --> 16:50.840
Hey, news flash, kid.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.350
They're not your family.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.890
They don't know who you
are, and they don't care.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.490
- Okay, okay, thanks for stopping by, Dad.

16:56.490 --> 16:59.913
- I'm not your dad, and
Marie was not your mother.

17:01.070 --> 17:03.720
As much as she tried to be
when she brought you home.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.140
She did everything to help you,

17:07.890 --> 17:10.060
including sacrificing us.

17:10.060 --> 17:14.343
(operatic singing in foreign language)

17:14.343 --> 17:15.403
You know what?

17:16.579 --> 17:19.623
You belong in a psych ward,
just like your real mother.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.454
Don't call me.

17:22.454 --> 17:27.038
(operatic signing in foreign language)

17:30.468 --> 17:33.540
- [Ella] Incoming call from John.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.600
- Answer.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.690
- [John] Hello.

17:35.690 --> 17:36.523
- I'm here.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.360
- [John] Did you get yesterday's message?

17:38.360 --> 17:40.750
Our editor needs the tuning
fork sound effects right away.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.470
It's a product video. We
can't go canned on it.

17:43.470 --> 17:45.670
- You moved up the
deadline. There's a queue.

17:45.670 --> 17:49.549
- [John] I'm prepared to pay
triple. Are you onboard or not?

17:49.549 --> 17:50.983
- Yeah, yeah, I'm onboard.

17:58.728 --> 18:01.702
(soft dramatic music)

18:01.702 --> 18:04.285
(fork humming)

18:08.286 --> 18:11.453
(soft dramatic music)

18:14.013 --> 18:16.094
- [Maggie] Hey.

18:16.094 --> 18:18.844
(dramatic music)

18:23.062 --> 18:25.812
(hard breathing)

18:27.440 --> 18:28.730
- [Winters] Ella, call John.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.566
- [Ella] Calling John.

18:30.566 --> 18:31.400
(phone ringing)

18:31.400 --> 18:32.370
- [John] Hello.

18:32.370 --> 18:35.286
- Your client with the
tuning forks, who is it?

18:35.286 --> 18:37.313
- [John] I'm sorry, but once again?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.210
- Who are we making the recordings for?

18:40.210 --> 18:41.823
Who hired you to make the video?

18:44.620 --> 18:47.230
I don't even see a brand on this product.

18:47.230 --> 18:49.030
What kind of tuning forks are these?

18:51.060 --> 18:52.253
Is this a real gig?

18:55.500 --> 18:56.863
Who hired you to call me?

18:57.864 --> 18:59.531
- [Ella] Call ended.

19:09.442 --> 19:12.359
(knocking on door)

19:15.929 --> 19:19.090
- I haven't gone into
102 yet. I was waiting--

19:19.090 --> 19:19.923
- The piano player in 607,

19:19.923 --> 19:22.230
have you seen her since yesterday?

19:22.230 --> 19:24.752
- No, I haven't seen her in over a month.

19:24.752 --> 19:25.620
- A month?

19:25.620 --> 19:28.830
- Yeah, her window was stuck,
so I stuck in my putty knife,

19:28.830 --> 19:29.740
and then with my hammer I--

19:29.740 --> 19:31.050
- Something's wrong.

19:31.050 --> 19:33.520
I didn't wanna ask you, but
you have to go check on her.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.420
Okay, you have to see
if something happened.

19:35.420 --> 19:38.230
- Whoa, um, is she sick?

19:38.230 --> 19:40.709
Because like Dr. Lee, in 702, maybe he--

19:40.709 --> 19:42.663
- No, she's not sick. She's ...

19:44.870 --> 19:46.313
I heard that ...

19:47.330 --> 19:48.163
There's this ...

19:53.150 --> 19:54.993
I'm sending you on a mission.

19:56.510 --> 19:58.600
I'm sending you on a mission.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.570
I'm the boss, okay, the sergeant,

20:01.570 --> 20:05.780
and you, you're the soldier
carrying out the mission.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.533
- You're not making any sense.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.947
- [Winters] Testing, can you hear me?

20:19.947 --> 20:22.050
Testing.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.380
- Hello, hello.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.490
- Private, this is a recon mission, okay.

20:25.490 --> 20:28.010
You're gonna go to Room
607, and you are gonna

20:28.010 --> 20:29.600
report back to me what you see

20:29.600 --> 20:31.200
through this, do you understand?

20:32.300 --> 20:33.133
Go.

20:34.290 --> 20:36.196
Where are you right now?

20:36.196 --> 20:39.103
- [Leonard] Okay, I'm here, Room 607.

20:40.090 --> 20:41.510
- Is there anything out of the ordinary?

20:41.510 --> 20:42.910
Do you see anybody?

20:42.910 --> 20:46.493
- [Leonard] I don't see
anybody. It kinda smells funny.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.203
It's unlocked. Should I go in?

20:52.480 --> 20:54.557
Hello, should I go in?

20:54.557 --> 20:56.913
- Yeah, slowly, don't touch anything.

20:57.843 --> 21:00.690
(door creaking)

21:00.690 --> 21:02.390
- [Leonard] It smells bad in here.

21:03.873 --> 21:05.033
- What do you see?

21:07.340 --> 21:11.310
- [Leonard] It's dark. The
light switch doesn't work.

21:11.310 --> 21:12.860
- Use your flashlight, Leonard.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.353
- [Leonard] I'm scared.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.693
- That's an order, Private.

21:20.599 --> 21:22.120
- [Leonard] Okay.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.270
- Tell me what you see.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.113
- [Leonard] There's plastic everywhere.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.066
- Plastic?

21:30.066 --> 21:33.050
(dramatic music)

21:33.050 --> 21:36.840
Get out. Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, get out of there now!

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
- [Leonard] Oh my God. Pieces!

21:38.840 --> 21:41.387
- The piano, the piano's in pieces?

21:41.387 --> 21:45.387
- Blood, there's blood (cries).

21:47.659 --> 21:49.826
I am in trouble, aren't I?

21:51.760 --> 21:53.553
- No, I am.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.600
Whoever killed her knows me.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.940
That music sparked my
memory, and the tuning forks,

21:59.940 --> 22:02.430
they caused a vision of a little girl.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.630
But I don't know why.

22:04.630 --> 22:07.713
If you see anything that doesn't belong,

22:10.550 --> 22:14.720
if you see anything that
seems weird to you at all,

22:14.720 --> 22:16.270
you come right back here to me.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.629
(hard breathing)

22:21.915 --> 22:24.915
(crickets chirping)

22:27.441 --> 22:29.691
(laughing)

22:30.980 --> 22:32.279
- That's funny.

22:32.279 --> 22:35.029
(laughing on TV)

22:36.836 --> 22:39.169
(chuckling)

22:43.880 --> 22:44.860
Hm?

22:44.860 --> 22:46.763
- Turn that down.

22:47.730 --> 22:49.640
- The TV?
- Mm-hm.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.473
- Okay.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.273
Because?

22:53.393 --> 22:55.673
- Because I have something that,

22:57.423 --> 22:59.240
that I wanna tell you.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.120
- Go for it.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.393
- Ask you, because you
have to be on board.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.810
- Have to be on board what?

23:07.020 --> 23:09.180
- You know the little boy that I

23:10.488 --> 23:11.522
found?

23:11.522 --> 23:13.522
- Yeah, the nut, the
nut. Yeah, the crazy kid.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.355
- Don't call him a nut.

23:14.355 --> 23:15.188
- I'm sorry.

23:15.188 --> 23:16.021
- He's not a nut.

23:16.021 --> 23:16.854
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23:16.854 --> 23:17.687
- He's a little boy.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.351
- Yeah, he's a little
crazy boy. Okay, go ahead.

23:19.351 --> 23:21.080
- Now, he's not crazy. He's
been through things you--

23:21.080 --> 23:22.625
- What's your point? Where are we going?

23:22.625 --> 23:24.110
Where are we going with this?

23:24.110 --> 23:29.110
- So I've been visiting him
at the hospital, every day.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.963
And now he's in a facility.

23:33.987 --> 23:35.130
- Okay, where are we
going with this, Marie?

23:35.130 --> 23:35.963
- Just hear me out.

23:35.963 --> 23:37.260
- Marie, where are you
going with this, Marie?

23:37.260 --> 23:38.585
- Just listen.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.418
- I'm listening.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.910
- He's a ward of the state.

23:40.910 --> 23:45.910
And they said that they can
fast-track this adoption,

23:46.580 --> 23:47.606
and I want--

23:47.606 --> 23:49.740
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.330
Please stop, please stop.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.050
If you need it, we can get a puppy.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.140
Okay, you want a puppy, we get a puppy.

23:55.140 --> 23:56.313
I don't need a kid coming into this house.

23:56.313 --> 23:59.910
- Alan, please, I, I can't even explain.

23:59.910 --> 24:01.423
I know I'm ...

24:02.500 --> 24:04.220
I love this boy. I love him.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.577
I can't explain it any other way.

24:05.577 --> 24:07.027
- I'm not good enough,
we need, we need a--

24:07.027 --> 24:11.670
- Just, I bonded with this
kid. He responds to me.

24:11.670 --> 24:13.130
He doesn't have anyone.

24:13.130 --> 24:14.195
Not a person, no one.

24:14.195 --> 24:15.987
- So what do you wanna do?

24:15.987 --> 24:18.180
- No one has shown up.
- What do you wanna do?

24:18.180 --> 24:19.013
- Tell me.

24:19.013 --> 24:21.330
- I wanna go through with the adoption.

24:21.330 --> 24:24.000
I wanna, there's a few papers left.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.610
I've already basically talked to everyone

24:26.610 --> 24:27.690
that I can talk to.

24:27.690 --> 24:32.140
And, the process has already begun, so--

24:32.140 --> 24:35.959
- You know what, let's talk
about this in the morning, okay?

24:35.959 --> 24:38.360
- Please, please, please.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.639
I've never wanted anything more.

24:40.639 --> 24:42.567
I mean, besides you (chuckles).

24:45.250 --> 24:46.663
He needs a loving home.

24:52.445 --> 24:54.610
(soft dramatic music)

24:54.610 --> 24:55.887
- Jesus.

24:55.887 --> 24:59.054
(soft dramatic music)

25:01.427 --> 25:02.260
- Sh. Sh.

25:04.210 --> 25:05.043
Just breathe.

25:06.190 --> 25:07.093
Just breathe.

25:08.020 --> 25:08.853
It's okay.

25:10.140 --> 25:10.973
Here.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.113
Forget about the outside.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.703
Feel the shell. Feel it.

25:18.910 --> 25:20.523
Focus on how it feels.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.310
That's good.

25:25.310 --> 25:28.227
(soft piano music)

25:29.230 --> 25:30.943
You ready to go look at the house?

25:32.098 --> 25:35.799
(soft piano music)

25:35.799 --> 25:37.799
This is the living room.

25:38.810 --> 25:41.393
There's Alan's special chair.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.481
The kitchen.

25:45.481 --> 25:48.398
(soft piano music)

26:17.575 --> 26:21.595
(dog barking in distance)

26:21.595 --> 26:22.800
You're home.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.783
And you're safe.

26:27.020 --> 26:30.813
I know you've forgotten
where you've come from,

26:32.247 --> 26:33.080
but it's okay.

26:34.270 --> 26:35.620
You don't have to remember.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.663
You can start again.

26:40.780 --> 26:41.613
With us.

26:57.202 --> 27:00.369
(soft dramatic music)

27:04.600 --> 27:06.767
(banging)

27:08.260 --> 27:10.677
- [Maggie] Did you see Mommy?

27:15.821 --> 27:18.571
(hard breathing)

27:32.598 --> 27:37.181
(operatic singing in foreign language)

27:53.604 --> 27:56.687
(recording skipping)

27:59.719 --> 28:04.302
(operatic singing in foreign language)

28:29.873 --> 28:32.853
- [Computerized Voice] Six. Six.

28:34.040 --> 28:34.873
Seven.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.083
Kin.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.860
Dread.

28:39.860 --> 28:40.693
Beta.

28:41.630 --> 28:42.463
Searchlight.

28:43.923 --> 28:44.756
Magenta.

28:45.859 --> 28:46.942
Unsound.

28:47.918 --> 28:48.751
Valley.

28:50.159 --> 28:51.789
Riven.

28:51.789 --> 28:54.647
- Your sounds won't keep you safe anymore.

28:55.494 --> 28:56.327
- What?

28:56.327 --> 28:58.760
- I said, what the hell
is the matter with you?

28:58.760 --> 28:59.660
Here.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.130
- I'm not expecting this.

29:01.130 --> 29:04.430
- Well it was in your box,
and it has your name on it.

29:04.430 --> 29:05.923
Am I picking up anything?

29:07.805 --> 29:10.972
(soft dramatic music)

29:15.560 --> 29:17.180
- Ella, call Jimmy.

29:17.180 --> 29:18.897
- [Ella] Calling Jimmy.

29:18.897 --> 29:20.580
(phone ringing)

29:20.580 --> 29:21.420
- [Jimmy] Yeah?

29:21.420 --> 29:23.620
- Yeah, those pills you've been
sending me, they're no good.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.010
Okay, I'm seeing shit. I just blacked out.

29:26.010 --> 29:27.810
- [Jimmy] Wait, who is this?

29:27.810 --> 29:29.080
- You know damn well who it is.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.868
I'm sending my messenger.
Get my order right this time.

29:31.868 --> 29:33.830
- [Jimmy] No can do, Bud.

29:33.830 --> 29:36.163
Look, I have been
telling you for how long?

29:36.163 --> 29:39.670
Just go back to your shrink
and go to a legit pharmacy.

29:39.670 --> 29:43.040
- I use you so I don't
have to go to my shrink

29:43.040 --> 29:44.620
or use a legit pharmacy.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.640
That's the whole point.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.173
- [Jimmy] You are in
way over your head, kid.

29:49.310 --> 29:50.770
- What's that supposed to mean?

29:50.770 --> 29:55.550
- [Jimmy] I can't help
you. Lose my number.

29:55.550 --> 29:56.550
- [Ella] Call ended.

29:58.420 --> 30:01.170
- Ella, call Dr. Hayworth's office.

30:01.170 --> 30:03.484
- [Ella] Calling Dr. Bill Hayworth.

30:03.484 --> 30:04.960
(phone ringing)

30:04.960 --> 30:07.110
- [Receptionist] Dr. Hayworth's office.

30:07.110 --> 30:10.270
- Hi, I need to get my
prescription refilled.

30:10.270 --> 30:12.870
Can I send someone to get them please?

30:12.870 --> 30:14.960
- [Receptionist] What's your name?

30:14.960 --> 30:15.793
- Last name Winters, first name--

30:15.793 --> 30:18.183
- [Receptionist] I know
who you are. Please hold.

30:20.503 --> 30:24.015
(soft dramatic music)

30:24.015 --> 30:25.051
- [Receptionist] Sir?

30:25.051 --> 30:26.470
- Yeah.

30:26.470 --> 30:29.222
- [Woman] Your current
prescriptions expired six months ago

30:29.222 --> 30:32.400
and you haven't been in for
a session in over a year.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.850
You'll need to schedule an appointment

30:33.850 --> 30:35.800
before we can write a new prescription.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.143
- Does the doctor make house calls?

30:40.143 --> 30:41.220
- [Receptionist] House calls?

30:41.220 --> 30:43.483
- Yeah, the ringing in my head, it's loud.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.500
- [Woman] I'm sorry, what?

30:46.500 --> 30:49.930
- Ella, end call. End call!

30:49.930 --> 30:50.930
- [Ella] Call ended.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.892
(phone ringing)

30:56.892 --> 30:58.979
(phone beeping)

30:58.979 --> 31:00.380
- Yeah, hello, Alan here.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.180
- [Bill] Alan, it's Dr. Hayworth.

31:02.180 --> 31:03.510
- Hey, Doc, what's up?

31:03.510 --> 31:05.710
- Your son called the
office, then hung up.

31:05.710 --> 31:08.300
We tried calling him back,
but he's not picking up.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.650
Since Marie's, well, you're
his emergency contact now.

31:12.650 --> 31:14.824
We're just checking in
to make sure he's okay.

31:14.824 --> 31:18.450
- I'll find out, and I'll
call you back, all right?

31:18.450 --> 31:19.540
- [Bill] Thank you, Alan.

31:19.540 --> 31:20.540
- Thanks a lot, Doc.

31:21.435 --> 31:24.102
(phone beeping)

31:25.989 --> 31:26.822
Great.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.440
- Hey, is that motorized rotating lens

31:29.440 --> 31:31.080
Francis wants for this available?

31:31.080 --> 31:32.280
- Yes, it's booked.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.300
- Got it.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.650
- Oh, before, I forget,
Alan, here's the info

31:35.650 --> 31:37.460
on that new sound
designer you asked about.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.510
This guy's really good and
said he'd be available.

31:40.510 --> 31:41.343
Alan?

31:41.343 --> 31:43.163
- Huh? Oh, yeah.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.010
I'm sorry, Annie.

31:46.430 --> 31:48.875
I haven't found a sound guy yet.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.370
Could you give me
another day or two, okay?

31:51.370 --> 31:53.760
Barry, what's the word on the motorized--

31:53.760 --> 31:54.593
- Rotating.

31:54.593 --> 31:57.393
- Yeah, the motorized
rotating lens for Francis?

31:58.230 --> 31:59.313
- It's booked.

32:00.706 --> 32:01.852
- Okay, good.

32:01.852 --> 32:05.019
(soft dramatic music)

32:27.300 --> 32:28.593
- Trudy's wedding dress.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.409
- [Alex] Mom?

32:34.409 --> 32:35.909
- [Martha] Huh? Hm?

32:38.128 --> 32:40.654
- [Alex] What was Dad like?

32:40.654 --> 32:45.228
- [Martha] Oh, well, he was funny,

32:45.228 --> 32:50.228
smart, handsome but,

32:50.469 --> 32:54.767
we're better off, just you and me.

32:54.767 --> 32:57.350
You have his eyes and my heart.

32:58.766 --> 33:00.676
- [Alex] And your butt, maybe.

33:00.676 --> 33:05.609
- [Martha] You fresh
boy. And my butt (laughs)

33:05.609 --> 33:06.557
(clicking sound)

33:06.557 --> 33:08.956
- [Alex] What was Daddy like?

33:08.956 --> 33:11.706
- [Martha] Oh, well, he was funny,

33:13.436 --> 33:15.019
smart, handsome but

33:17.694 --> 33:20.527
we're better off, just you and me.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.551
(voices screaming)

33:32.197 --> 33:34.282
(dial tone humming)

33:34.282 --> 33:36.885
- [Computerized Voice] Hawthorne.

33:36.885 --> 33:37.718
Springs.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.017
Aspen.

33:41.700 --> 33:42.533
Delta.

33:44.458 --> 33:45.291
Kill.

33:47.042 --> 33:47.875
Seven.

33:49.424 --> 33:50.257
Sibilance.

33:52.117 --> 33:52.950
Nemesis.

33:53.997 --> 33:57.164
(soft dramatic music)

33:58.670 --> 34:00.253
- [Maggie] Get help.

34:01.379 --> 34:04.466
(soft dramatic music)

34:04.466 --> 34:07.216
(deep breathing)

34:12.420 --> 34:17.003
(operatic singing in foreign language)

34:22.415 --> 34:25.415
(muffled screaming)

34:28.228 --> 34:32.812
(operatic singing in foreign language)

34:37.731 --> 34:39.496
- [Shawn] Your fucking parents.

34:39.496 --> 34:41.413
- [Rosie] Please don't.

34:43.321 --> 34:46.154
(muffled arguing)

34:47.373 --> 34:50.058
- Stop. Stop, please.

34:50.058 --> 34:52.100
Please stop screaming.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.929
Stop screaming at her.

34:53.929 --> 34:57.471
Get your hands off her,
you son of a bitch!

34:57.471 --> 35:00.221
(hard breathing)

35:32.690 --> 35:35.357
(phone ringing)

35:38.350 --> 35:39.183
- [Marie] Hello?

35:40.084 --> 35:42.800
Ha ha ha, just kidding.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.173
Leave a message.

35:46.659 --> 35:47.713
- Hey, Doll.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.373
You know what?

35:53.770 --> 35:57.263
I, uh, I forgot to change the
stupid filters again, huh?

35:59.530 --> 36:01.253
And the, the, the vents.

36:02.560 --> 36:06.573
The vents are so dusty,
filters so damn dirty,

36:09.650 --> 36:12.350
I can practically hear you
busting my balls right now.

36:17.540 --> 36:18.807
And then you know what?

36:19.870 --> 36:23.410
Stupid me, I keep forgetting
where like I'm putting stuff,

36:23.410 --> 36:24.243
and I, I,

36:25.820 --> 36:27.043
I catch myself.

36:28.140 --> 36:30.280
I catch myself calling you

36:30.280 --> 36:32.263
and asking you to help me look for it.

36:36.210 --> 36:37.727
The other day, I, uh.

36:40.356 --> 36:41.689
I can't do this.

36:43.650 --> 36:45.223
I miss you so much, god dammit.

36:48.270 --> 36:49.533
I can't do this (cries).

37:04.812 --> 37:07.143
(sighing)

37:07.143 --> 37:10.310
(soft dramatic music)

37:29.040 --> 37:29.873
- Yay!

37:32.149 --> 37:34.290
(laughing)

37:34.290 --> 37:36.383
I knew that smile was in there somewhere.

37:37.867 --> 37:41.034
(soft dramatic music)

37:49.640 --> 37:52.263
No, no. Whatever it is,

37:53.171 --> 37:54.856
don't think about it.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.773
(soft piano music)

37:59.414 --> 38:01.280
(bell ringing)

38:01.280 --> 38:02.909
Do you hear that?

38:02.909 --> 38:03.742
Hear that?

38:05.196 --> 38:06.029
Here.

38:06.970 --> 38:07.803
Listen.

38:08.714 --> 38:10.800
(bell ringing)

38:10.800 --> 38:12.350
Whenever the bad thoughts come,

38:13.860 --> 38:16.033
just ring that bell and listen.

38:17.368 --> 38:19.951
(bell ringing)

38:26.580 --> 38:27.630
- What are you doing?

38:29.760 --> 38:30.710
- What do you mean?

38:32.047 --> 38:33.730
- You know, the thing with the kid.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.790
I mean, has the doctor
cleared this thing, or what?

38:35.790 --> 38:36.740
What are you doing?

38:37.840 --> 38:38.673
- Hold on.

38:41.030 --> 38:42.133
I just ...

38:44.980 --> 38:46.547
- I have better things for you to be

38:46.547 --> 38:49.556
doing than this.

38:49.556 --> 38:52.036
Let's put this up. Can you put this up?

38:52.036 --> 38:53.107
Hm?

38:53.107 --> 38:56.830
- Well, let me just finish today's entry

38:56.830 --> 38:59.393
before I forget everything, okay?

39:00.328 --> 39:01.161
And just ...

39:03.765 --> 39:05.265
- Yeah, sure, finish whatever.

39:08.470 --> 39:11.700
No problem, I might as well
throw my Viagra down the toilet.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.950
(scoffing)

39:27.543 --> 39:29.530
(traffic passing)

39:29.530 --> 39:31.983
- [Ella] Incoming call from Alan.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.820
Incoming call from Alan.

39:35.820 --> 39:36.653
- Answer.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.410
Yeah?

39:38.410 --> 39:40.610
- So you used to have
blackouts, am I right?

39:42.630 --> 39:43.740
- Your point being?

39:43.740 --> 39:46.399
- My point being, how's
that piano player of yours?

39:46.399 --> 39:48.020
- [Winters] Why don't
you just spit it out?

39:48.020 --> 39:49.403
- Fine, no problem, how positive are you

39:49.403 --> 39:51.623
that you haven't left that room?

39:54.080 --> 39:55.270
- Ella, end call.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.293
- [Ella] Call ended.

39:57.524 --> 39:58.643
- You son of a bitch.

40:03.310 --> 40:04.680
- Ella, call Leonard.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.784
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

40:06.784 --> 40:09.701
(knocking on door)

40:13.450 --> 40:15.093
- What happened to your secret knock?

40:18.560 --> 40:23.355
Leonard.

40:23.355 --> 40:25.377
Leonard, Room 201.

40:25.377 --> 40:29.097
(soft dramatic music)

40:29.097 --> 40:31.310
- Martha and Alex.

40:31.310 --> 40:33.010
She sews my uniforms.

40:33.010 --> 40:34.480
Alex lets me play his games.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.080
- Leonard.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.930
I have to stop what's happening.
I can't do it by myself.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.360
- I can't do it. I can't help.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.510
I'm broken.

40:43.510 --> 40:45.290
- Hey, Leonard.

40:45.290 --> 40:46.860
So am I.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.540
That's what makes us a good team, okay?

40:48.540 --> 40:50.840
That's why we need each other.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.310
Leonard.

40:52.310 --> 40:54.770
Leonard, you need to tell
me, is there anything

40:54.770 --> 40:57.267
out of the ordinary going
on in this building?

40:57.267 --> 40:59.197
- Out of the ordinary?

40:59.197 --> 41:01.160
Like all this?

41:01.160 --> 41:03.902
Or like you spying on people, like that?

41:03.902 --> 41:04.890
- Hey, that's not what I mean.

41:04.890 --> 41:05.880
Have you seen anyone new,

41:05.880 --> 41:07.833
anybody that you haven't seen before?

41:09.404 --> 41:10.237
- No.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.470
I tell you everything.

41:14.943 --> 41:17.440
- I'm missing something.
There has to be something.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.420
It's impossible for someone to get in here

41:19.420 --> 41:20.253
without being seen.

41:20.253 --> 41:21.850
That doesn't make any sense.
It has to be something.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.840
It's someone who's
poking their nose around,

41:23.840 --> 41:25.320
someone you didn't let in their apartment,

41:25.320 --> 41:26.483
someone you, something, somebody--

41:26.483 --> 41:27.316
- There is something.

41:27.316 --> 41:28.880
- Who gave you a bad feeling.
- There is something.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.710
- But it's actually nothing.

41:32.710 --> 41:33.543
- What?

41:34.690 --> 41:37.373
- One apartment's empty,
but somebody pays for it.

41:38.753 --> 41:42.643
Harris makes me check the
smoke detectors twice a year.

41:43.570 --> 41:45.210
- Wait, somebody's paying
for an empty apartment?

41:45.210 --> 41:46.043
Since when?

41:47.930 --> 41:49.293
- After you moved in.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.193
A week later, I think.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.300
- Good, go there.

41:56.300 --> 41:57.223
- Come with me.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.880
- I can't.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.560
Every time I walk out
that door, it feels like

42:01.560 --> 42:03.700
my chest is gonna explode,
do you understand?

42:03.700 --> 42:05.763
That's what it feels like, okay?

42:06.612 --> 42:09.750
Okay, either way it doesn't
matter. It's not ...

42:09.750 --> 42:11.963
It's me they want, okay? It's not you.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.445
They know I need you.

42:14.445 --> 42:15.278
You're ...

42:15.278 --> 42:18.445
(soft dramatic music)

42:20.583 --> 42:21.500
- I'm what?

42:24.539 --> 42:25.903
- You're useful.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.153
You're useful.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.060
Leonard, I'll buy you whatever you want.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.883
Okay, name it. Just help me.

42:35.946 --> 42:37.963
- I don't want any more collectibles.

42:39.260 --> 42:41.343
I just wanna go home and watch cartoons.

42:42.778 --> 42:46.030
I'm going to go peek one last time

42:46.030 --> 42:48.973
so you get off my back.

42:50.980 --> 42:51.813
- Thank you.

42:54.522 --> 42:56.572
You're the most intrepid man that I know.

42:59.310 --> 43:00.323
- Intrepid.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.540
Valiant, bold, fearless?

43:06.596 --> 43:08.253
I'm not any of that.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.420
(soft dramatic music)

43:14.545 --> 43:17.430
(muffled shouting)

43:17.430 --> 43:19.265
(door opening and closing)

43:19.265 --> 43:21.540
- [Ella] Window, window.

43:21.540 --> 43:23.090
- Ella, stop the alarm.

43:23.090 --> 43:24.523
- [Ella] Alarm stopped.

43:29.592 --> 43:32.759
(soft dramatic music)

43:34.001 --> 43:37.698
(knocking on door)

43:37.698 --> 43:38.531
- Leonard, what ...

43:38.531 --> 43:40.113
- Hey, so this is ...

43:44.150 --> 43:45.790
Do I know you?

43:45.790 --> 43:46.838
- No.

43:46.838 --> 43:48.420
I mean, I don't think so.

43:48.420 --> 43:51.390
I mean, I feel like I'd remember.

43:51.390 --> 43:56.250
- Uh, well, this cute girl
just came by my house.

43:56.250 --> 43:57.950
She shoved this at me,
and then she ran off.

43:57.950 --> 43:59.750
But it's got your address on it.

43:59.750 --> 44:00.673
- Cute? Cute how?

44:02.240 --> 44:03.153
- I don't know.

44:04.900 --> 44:06.700
She had brown hair and green eyes.

44:08.270 --> 44:11.670
- Yeah, yeah, I know who
you're talking about.

44:11.670 --> 44:15.423
- Okay. She seemed upset.

44:17.060 --> 44:18.203
Do you want it or not?

44:21.084 --> 44:22.650
(muffled shouting)

44:22.650 --> 44:23.493
Oh my God.

44:24.940 --> 44:28.059
Is that a TEAC? A TEAC 3340?

44:28.059 --> 44:29.810
- Hey, what are you doing?

44:29.810 --> 44:31.000
Hey, what are you doing?

44:31.000 --> 44:32.663
- Who's the dick next door?

44:33.600 --> 44:35.350
- [Shawn] You're nothing,
you're worthless!

44:35.350 --> 44:36.713
- Four separate channels.

44:37.570 --> 44:39.870
Can record eight sources simultaneously

44:39.870 --> 44:42.200
or one channel at a time synchronously.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.830
Independent microphone inputs.

44:44.830 --> 44:47.833
Line inputs and outputs,
each with their own controls.

44:48.749 --> 44:51.163
Unlimited mixing options.

44:52.650 --> 44:55.463
And a classic '70s analog sound.

44:59.974 --> 45:02.170
(chuckling)

45:02.170 --> 45:03.758
(soft music)

45:03.758 --> 45:04.591
Wow.

45:04.591 --> 45:07.008
(soft music)

45:11.430 --> 45:12.263
Sorry.

45:13.620 --> 45:14.920
I'm kind of an audiophile.

45:16.770 --> 45:18.043
I get it from my dad.

45:20.810 --> 45:22.173
What is this place?

45:24.360 --> 45:27.010
Oh my God, are you a
sound effects designer?

45:27.010 --> 45:29.144
- Hey, no, don't walk on that, please.

45:29.144 --> 45:32.030
(laughing)

45:32.030 --> 45:35.630
- Hey, do you mix music and
sound effects for live shows?

45:35.630 --> 45:37.040
Because I'm camgirl right now,

45:37.040 --> 45:39.053
but I've got this act I
wanna take on the road.

45:39.053 --> 45:40.980
I've got an audition at the
Garter Room in a couple days.

45:40.980 --> 45:43.180
- Stop touching things, please.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.340
No, I don't really do that
sort of thing, although I could

45:45.340 --> 45:48.350
probably mix circles around
whoever you're using.

45:48.350 --> 45:49.823
- Oh, well, that would be me.

45:50.863 --> 45:52.723
I'm trying to produce my own mix track.

45:53.830 --> 45:54.930
- Produce it yourself?

45:56.030 --> 45:56.863
- Yeah.

45:58.470 --> 46:01.223
I haven't found anybody that I like yet.

46:01.223 --> 46:04.140
(muffled shouting)

46:05.120 --> 46:08.543
- You mean you want me
to help you produce it?

46:10.580 --> 46:11.413
- Maybe.

46:13.530 --> 46:16.489
- Yeah, I'd love to, I'm just,
I'm kinda tied up right now

46:16.489 --> 46:19.880
with a couple things, and
even if I was available,

46:19.880 --> 46:23.133
it's not, it's not really
the sort of thing I do.

46:27.327 --> 46:29.430
- Look, if you change your mind,

46:29.430 --> 46:32.030
I live in this little house
right across the street.

46:37.660 --> 46:39.345
You can come over if you want.

46:39.345 --> 46:42.262
(muffled shouting)

46:45.950 --> 46:47.950
Try telling that guy to suck your balls.

46:51.694 --> 46:54.474
(door opening)

46:54.474 --> 46:58.120
(muffled shouting)

46:58.120 --> 47:00.623
- Suck my fucking balls, bitch!

47:05.310 --> 47:07.190
Did you see that girl?

47:07.190 --> 47:08.140
She was hot, right?

47:10.944 --> 47:13.480
- I found this in there.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.230
- That was in there, the apartment?

47:16.200 --> 47:18.883
- On the floor, in the middle of the room.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.303
- Okay, let's see what's on it.

47:23.994 --> 47:24.827
- Don't.

47:25.967 --> 47:26.800
- I have to.

47:29.884 --> 47:31.313
- I'm going home.

47:34.786 --> 47:39.786
If anything happens to me,
you were the best boss.

47:40.239 --> 47:41.072
Boss.

47:42.390 --> 47:44.963
- What are you talking about?
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

47:54.182 --> 47:57.765
(door opening and closing)

48:00.041 --> 48:03.208
(soft dramatic music)

48:07.164 --> 48:09.016
- [Disguised Voice] Marie?

48:09.016 --> 48:10.766
- [Marie] Oh God, hi.

48:11.971 --> 48:13.010
- [Disguised Voice] How
are we feeling today?

48:13.010 --> 48:15.450
- [Marie] A little better than yesterday,

48:15.450 --> 48:17.203
but not so hot.

48:19.128 --> 48:20.147
- [Disguised Voice]
Let's get you hooked up.

48:20.147 --> 48:23.630
- [Marie] Do you know what
time the doctor's coming today?

48:23.630 --> 48:25.524
- [Disguised Voice] Oh, you
won't need the doctor today.

48:25.524 --> 48:27.052
You're checking out.

48:27.052 --> 48:27.885
- [Marie] What?

48:27.885 --> 48:32.885
He said I'm showing improvement,
but I have questions.

48:33.088 --> 48:34.890
- [Disguised Voice] Save the questions.

48:34.890 --> 48:37.139
Let's get this in your PICC line.

48:37.139 --> 48:38.161
- [Marie] What is it?

48:38.161 --> 48:39.789
- [Disguised Voice] Potassium chloride.

48:39.789 --> 48:42.294
- [Marie] What? What's that for?

48:42.294 --> 48:43.846
- [Disguised Voice] For
the damage you've done.

48:43.846 --> 48:45.711
(Marie crying)

48:45.711 --> 48:48.299
(soft dramatic music)

48:48.299 --> 48:49.716
[Disguised Voice] I hope you rot.

48:57.484 --> 48:59.651
(banging)

49:04.326 --> 49:06.058
- [Maggie] Is it you?

49:06.058 --> 49:08.975
(knocking on door)

49:25.640 --> 49:26.473
- Harris.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.940
- You know that nice
young couple down in 102?

49:31.810 --> 49:33.870
Just moved in, you know the ones.

49:33.870 --> 49:34.703
- How would I know?

49:34.703 --> 49:35.643
- They found this.

49:36.600 --> 49:39.270
Apparently, they're too
stupid to know what it is.

49:39.270 --> 49:41.690
They thought the vent was broken.

49:41.690 --> 49:42.789
Can you believe it?

49:42.789 --> 49:44.480
- I don't know what you're talking about.

49:44.480 --> 49:47.210
- Those are my tenants.

49:47.210 --> 49:48.440
- Oh, now you care about them.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.503
It's funny, since you're
always screwing them over.

49:50.503 --> 49:51.500
- When am I getting those tapes?

49:51.500 --> 49:53.100
- When I get my deposit back.

49:53.100 --> 49:54.870
- That's the wrong
answer. I want them now.

49:54.870 --> 49:56.310
- That empty room, the one that's being

49:56.310 --> 49:57.853
paid for, who's renting it?

49:59.010 --> 50:00.410
- How'd you know about that?

50:01.990 --> 50:06.693
- Those recordings I have of
you, they'd ruin you forever.

50:10.810 --> 50:12.110
- Well it's a cash deal.

50:13.540 --> 50:15.233
No paperwork.

50:16.480 --> 50:19.373
They get a key and
anonymity, and I get greased.

50:21.130 --> 50:22.540
Triple the going rate.

50:22.540 --> 50:23.580
- Triple?

50:23.580 --> 50:24.830
- Yeah, triple.

50:26.410 --> 50:27.323
You know what?

50:30.120 --> 50:33.630
Your rent-free days, they're over.

50:33.630 --> 50:35.720
Another thing, tomorrow.

50:35.720 --> 50:39.470
Tomorrow, we start our
routine building inspection,

50:39.470 --> 50:43.140
so then I'm gonna personally
scour every fucking nook

50:43.140 --> 50:45.570
and cranny, looking for
more of your damn bugs.

50:45.570 --> 50:46.403
- No, you can't do that.

50:46.403 --> 50:48.740
You have to give more notice
than that. It's the law.

50:48.740 --> 50:50.580
- Oh, it's the law.

50:50.580 --> 50:55.580
Well, the notices went out
two weeks ago, smart ass.

50:57.006 --> 50:59.370
It was slipped under the
door, just like everyone else.

50:59.370 --> 51:00.793
You didn't get yours?

51:02.350 --> 51:03.183
Really (laughs)?

51:04.360 --> 51:05.423
I can swear ...

51:06.580 --> 51:10.903
If I hear you tapping anyone
else or doing anything shady

51:10.903 --> 51:14.670
in this fucking building,
I don't give a flying fuck

51:14.670 --> 51:16.283
in hell what you got on me,

51:17.810 --> 51:19.791
I'm gonna bring the heat down on you.

51:19.791 --> 51:22.958
(soft dramatic music)

51:23.936 --> 51:25.269
Have a nice day.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.250
- Ella, call Leonard.

51:31.250 --> 51:32.776
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

51:32.776 --> 51:36.130
(phone ringing)

51:36.130 --> 51:37.670
- [Leonard] Hello.

51:37.670 --> 51:39.720
- Is Harris doing an inspection tomorrow?

51:40.640 --> 51:43.638
- [Leonard] Yeah, tomorrow
we're doing the inspection.

51:43.638 --> 51:45.840
- Why didn't I get a notice?

51:45.840 --> 51:48.600
- [Leonard] Because he leaves you alone.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.770
He never inspects your unit.

51:49.770 --> 51:51.500
- Harris found the bug in 102.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.663
Clearly, you did a very sloppy job, okay.

51:53.663 --> 51:56.440
They are going to find the piano player.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.960
They are going to find Martha and Alex.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.030
They're going to find all of our bugs.

52:00.030 --> 52:01.720
They're gonna pull all of our bugs,

52:01.720 --> 52:03.310
and then we're done for.

52:03.310 --> 52:06.463
Okay, so we need to
pull the bugs right now.

52:08.170 --> 52:09.603
Are you even listening?

52:11.816 --> 52:15.390
- [Leonard] If I do it, if I
get all the bugs, are we done?

52:17.035 --> 52:18.580
Are we done sneaking?

52:18.580 --> 52:20.620
- No more sneaking. No, never again.

52:20.620 --> 52:22.903
And this way no one else gets hurt, okay?

52:24.290 --> 52:27.130
- [Leonard] Sounds good to me, Boss.

52:27.130 --> 52:30.000
I'll figure out how to
get them this afternoon.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
- [Ella] Call ended.

52:34.540 --> 52:36.220
- Ella, call Alan.

52:36.220 --> 52:38.047
- [Ella] Calling Alan.

52:38.047 --> 52:40.500
(phone ringing)

52:40.500 --> 52:42.290
- [Alan] You know what,
if I would have known

52:42.290 --> 52:44.530
that disowning you was
gonna make you talk to me

52:44.530 --> 52:46.760
more in two days than you have in a year,

52:46.760 --> 52:48.420
I would have asked you to move in instead.

52:48.420 --> 52:52.230
Then you woulda gone running
in the opposite direction, huh?

52:52.230 --> 52:55.867
- I swear to you, I haven't hurt a soul.

52:56.792 --> 52:59.283
I know I'm fucked up.

53:00.270 --> 53:02.980
Okay, I know that. I realize that.

53:02.980 --> 53:07.980
But I, I, and I don't know
why I abandoned Marie.

53:08.370 --> 53:09.403
Something ...

53:11.650 --> 53:14.593
Just something pulled me
away, okay, but I, I ...

53:16.150 --> 53:17.957
I need one thing.

53:17.957 --> 53:18.810
- (chuckles) Oh.

53:18.810 --> 53:20.780
- Marie's journals, bring them, please.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.990
My bugs are the only road
map I have to figure out

53:22.990 --> 53:25.430
what's happening, and I
am about to lose them.

53:25.430 --> 53:26.450
- Enough.

53:26.450 --> 53:29.290
- People are being
killed. Marie was killed.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.940
Her journals can help me stop the killer.

53:31.940 --> 53:34.060
I need the info in those journals.

53:34.060 --> 53:36.380
Every nightmare, blackout,
episode I've ever had

53:36.380 --> 53:38.560
are in those journals, I need them please.

53:38.560 --> 53:41.700
- You know, I am so done with
your conspiracy theories.

53:41.700 --> 53:43.070
- You've hated me from Day One, man.

53:43.070 --> 53:46.920
You want me to fail. You want
me to be locked up with Iris.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.060
- You know what? Do not
put this on me, all right?

53:50.060 --> 53:53.840
- No, no, because you had
to share Marie with me,

53:53.840 --> 53:55.450
because you never wanted kids,

53:55.450 --> 53:58.440
because she could never
have any kids of her own,

53:58.440 --> 54:01.510
so she was your perfect match.

54:01.510 --> 54:05.870
And then I came along and
I ruined it all for you,

54:05.870 --> 54:10.833
and you have only seen the
worst in me ever since.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.210
Right or wrong?

54:14.210 --> 54:16.200
Right or wrong?

54:16.200 --> 54:19.915
- Look, I was not built
for this shit, all right?

54:19.915 --> 54:22.200
And I never have been.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.908
(phone beeping)

54:24.908 --> 54:25.741
Ugh.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.150
(inhaling)

54:37.270 --> 54:39.391
- [Becky] In this building lately.

54:39.391 --> 54:40.841
I mean Leonard, he's acting--

54:42.595 --> 54:44.703
- [Computerized Voice] Six.

54:44.703 --> 54:45.536
Six.

54:49.955 --> 54:50.788
Hawthorne.

54:52.223 --> 54:53.056
Springs.

54:54.687 --> 54:57.104
(soft music)

55:04.078 --> 55:06.638
(exhaling)

55:06.638 --> 55:09.221
- What now, what now, what now?

55:11.086 --> 55:14.291
(soft tapping on wall)

55:14.291 --> 55:17.458
(soft dramatic music)

55:18.530 --> 55:19.363
- Rosie?

55:21.963 --> 55:23.233
Is that you?

55:28.580 --> 55:29.540
Do you need help?

55:32.932 --> 55:37.932
- [Shawn] Go on. Take one
step outside that apartment.

55:37.971 --> 55:39.304
And I'll kill you.

55:40.243 --> 55:42.910
(birds singing)

55:44.463 --> 55:47.380
(soft piano music)

56:35.453 --> 56:36.286
(recorder beeping)

56:36.286 --> 56:39.373
- [Marie] This is not a
normal journal entry, Alan.

56:39.373 --> 56:41.270
I'm gonna tell you but
if something happens,

56:41.270 --> 56:43.193
I, I hope you get this.

56:44.280 --> 56:47.400
There is an odd woman. She
works here at the hospital.

56:47.400 --> 56:48.820
Or I thought she did.

56:48.820 --> 56:51.210
She comes around checking
on me, making small talk,

56:51.210 --> 56:54.910
so over time I ended up
telling her about him.

56:54.910 --> 56:58.380
The work we did, his
therapy, even my journals

56:58.380 --> 57:00.230
and that my old ones are in the shed.

57:01.730 --> 57:06.099
Today, I admitted I suppressed
his memories using sound,

57:06.099 --> 57:08.683
and she demanded to read my journals.

57:08.683 --> 57:11.190
When I told her no, she became enraged

57:11.190 --> 57:12.393
and then stormed out.

57:13.460 --> 57:14.553
She frightened me.

57:15.555 --> 57:19.097
I'm sorry, Alan, but I
think we're in danger.

57:20.031 --> 57:20.948
I love you.

57:22.217 --> 57:25.384
(soft dramatic music)

57:34.240 --> 57:35.483
- No no no no no.

57:36.595 --> 57:39.762
(soft dramatic music)

57:43.090 --> 57:43.923
Dammit.

57:44.870 --> 57:45.773
This is not right.

57:47.684 --> 57:48.517
- [Computerized Voice] Riven.

57:49.520 --> 57:50.353
Sycamore.

57:52.039 --> 57:52.956
Threshold.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.233
Yellow.

57:56.332 --> 57:57.165

57:58.352 --> 57:59.285
Attack.

57:59.285 --> 58:00.133
- [Ella] Window, window.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.650
- Stop the alarm.

58:02.650 --> 58:04.166
- [Ella] Alarm stopped.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.778
- [Ella] Incoming call from Alan.

58:08.778 --> 58:09.808
- Decline.

58:09.808 --> 58:11.725
- [Ella] Call declined.

58:13.850 --> 58:17.020
Incoming call from Alan.

58:17.020 --> 58:18.510
- Answer.

58:18.510 --> 58:19.343
What?

58:19.343 --> 58:21.250
- If that song triggered something in you,

58:21.250 --> 58:22.930
it might do the same thing for Iris.

58:22.930 --> 58:24.473
Send it right now, okay?

58:25.943 --> 58:27.426
- [Computerized Voice] Valley.

58:27.426 --> 58:28.709
- Ella, end call.

58:28.709 --> 58:30.376
- [Ella] Call ended.

58:32.549 --> 58:34.966
(soft music)

58:36.378 --> 58:38.550
- Ella, record and send to Alan.

58:38.550 --> 58:39.500
- [Ella] Recording.

58:44.530 --> 58:45.363
- Come on.

58:49.610 --> 58:50.580
Boom.

58:50.580 --> 58:53.747
(soft dramatic music)

59:40.317 --> 59:43.067

59:45.900 --> 59:49.067

59:59.769 --> 1:00:02.352
(door buzzing)

1:00:06.716 --> 1:00:09.883
(soft dramatic music)

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:18.403
- Mr. Winters?

1:00:22.390 --> 1:00:23.223
- Hi.

1:00:24.170 --> 1:00:25.820
What's wrong with her?

1:00:25.820 --> 1:00:28.946
- Catatonic schizophrenia,
she's had it for some time now.

1:00:28.946 --> 1:00:31.847
- Can she communicate with me?

1:00:31.847 --> 1:00:34.351
- She can't speak or respond or move.

1:00:34.351 --> 1:00:36.363
- Is she gonna be able to hear me?

1:00:38.577 --> 1:00:40.748
- I think she can, but
you wouldn't know it.

1:00:40.748 --> 1:00:41.670
- I see.

1:00:41.670 --> 1:00:43.236
I mean, what are we talking about here,

1:00:43.236 --> 1:00:44.423
some kind of trauma or something?

1:00:45.620 --> 1:00:46.850
- There are environmental triggers,

1:00:46.850 --> 1:00:48.300
but genetics play a part too.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:50.813
- Great.

1:00:54.335 --> 1:00:56.673
No no, no no, you don't have to do that.

1:00:58.839 --> 1:00:59.689
- You a relative?

1:01:01.670 --> 1:01:05.123
- My adopted son, she's
his biological mother.

1:01:06.460 --> 1:01:08.477
- [Woman On PA] Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair.

1:01:08.477 --> 1:01:11.340
Dr. Jay Hamilton, Dr. Jay Hamilton.

1:01:15.001 --> 1:01:16.810
- Boy they found with the seashell?

1:01:16.810 --> 1:01:17.643
- Yes.

1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:22.900
- I was in high school when that happened.

1:01:22.900 --> 1:01:24.400
How's he doing?

1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:25.650
- He's good, really good.

1:01:26.675 --> 1:01:28.840
- You know, when they found
her wandering the fields,

1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:32.413
I just thought, only a
monster could be responsible.

1:01:32.413 --> 1:01:33.593
- Yeah.

1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:37.290
- Did they ever find out what happened?

1:01:37.290 --> 1:01:38.663
- Nope, nothing.

1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:43.570
- You did a good thing.

1:01:43.570 --> 1:01:44.403
- Thank you.

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:47.550
- I think you should talk to her.

1:01:47.550 --> 1:01:49.850
Tell her about her boy.
I think she'd like it.

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:51.713
- Okay.

1:01:52.550 --> 1:01:54.000
Thank you very much.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.960
- [Woman On PA] Dr.
Davis, telephone please,

1:01:57.960 --> 1:01:59.993
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:06.153
- Hi, Iris.

1:02:08.823 --> 1:02:09.656
Can you hear me?

1:02:11.318 --> 1:02:12.913
You wanna give me a sign or?

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:19.433
I, uh, I guess I should apologize.

1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:22.820
I mean, all those years and we never

1:02:22.820 --> 1:02:24.320
brought him here to visit you.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:28.293
Marie never wanted to.

1:02:34.180 --> 1:02:37.380
You know, the funny thing is, I,

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:38.743
I feel guilty about it now.

1:02:41.610 --> 1:02:42.585
I don't know.

1:02:42.585 --> 1:02:45.957
Maybe seeing him woulda
helped you and him.

1:02:50.180 --> 1:02:52.040
I raised your boy.

1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:53.883
I mean, I tried to at least.

1:02:55.260 --> 1:02:57.410
And I guess I could
have done a better job.

1:02:58.919 --> 1:03:02.086
(soft dramatic music)

1:03:07.193 --> 1:03:10.110
- [Nurse In Distance] Hold that in.

1:03:10.110 --> 1:03:13.277
(soft dramatic music)

1:03:28.751 --> 1:03:29.584
Hey, um,

1:03:31.283 --> 1:03:35.307
does this sound, sound familiar to you?

1:03:36.314 --> 1:03:40.897
(operatic singing in foreign language)

1:04:19.327 --> 1:04:22.244
(knocking on door)

1:04:23.497 --> 1:04:26.476
(knocking on door)

1:04:26.476 --> 1:04:29.240
- I don't have time for this right now.

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:31.040
- You've been watching me with that.

1:04:33.210 --> 1:04:35.513
I came in earlier, and
I saw it, and I knew.

1:04:38.690 --> 1:04:40.863
I let men watch me for a living.

1:04:42.170 --> 1:04:43.470
I know what it feels like.

1:04:44.820 --> 1:04:47.000
Somebody's eyes, when
someone looks at you,

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.483
there's a contact, there's a vibe.

1:04:52.173 --> 1:04:53.803
I can feel your fucked up vibe.

1:04:58.163 --> 1:05:00.483
When I came in earlier, I saw it.

1:05:03.670 --> 1:05:05.740
You knew exactly who I was when you

1:05:05.740 --> 1:05:08.170
opened that door, didn't you?

1:05:08.170 --> 1:05:10.983
You put that girl up,
just to make me come over.

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:17.233
It's fine.

1:05:17.233 --> 1:05:20.520
(soft dramatic music)

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.280
Hey, I'm used to it.

1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:23.880
Men have been watching me since

1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:25.840
before I had my first period.

1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:29.003
They usually just pay for it.

1:05:30.771 --> 1:05:32.471
I just wanted you to be different.

1:05:35.196 --> 1:05:36.096
Are you different?

1:05:39.256 --> 1:05:41.412
- I think you're in danger.

1:05:41.412 --> 1:05:42.512
- What?

1:05:42.512 --> 1:05:45.113
- You have to keep away
from me, away from here.

1:05:46.123 --> 1:05:47.339
- Ow, let go, you're hurting me.

1:05:47.339 --> 1:05:49.660
- It wasn't my messenger.
Someone lured you here.

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:51.320
I'm sorry for watching.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:55.633
Okay, I just, when I noticed
you, it made me feel ...

1:05:58.010 --> 1:05:58.843
You have to go.

1:06:04.970 --> 1:06:06.560
Ella, call Leonard.

1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:08.640
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:11.210
We're sorry, you have reached a number

1:06:11.210 --> 1:06:14.623
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:16.395
If you feel have reached--

1:06:16.395 --> 1:06:17.510
- Ella, end call.

1:06:17.510 --> 1:06:18.400
- [Ella] Call ended.

1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:20.050
- Ella, call Leonard.

1:06:20.050 --> 1:06:21.433
- [Ella] Calling Leonard.

1:06:22.300 --> 1:06:25.339
We're sorry, you have reached
a number that has been--

1:06:25.339 --> 1:06:26.256
- End call.

1:06:27.093 --> 1:06:27.926
- [Disguised Voice] I have your messenger.

1:06:31.699 --> 1:06:32.866
I'll get Alan.

1:06:33.718 --> 1:06:35.468
And you are to blame.

1:06:37.498 --> 1:06:40.120
Because you forgot about me.

1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:41.063
- Stop.

1:06:42.589 --> 1:06:43.960
- I'll kill them.

1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:44.793
- What?

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:47.723
- The way I killed Marie.

1:06:49.991 --> 1:06:53.549
(device smashing)

1:06:53.549 --> 1:06:56.466
(knocking on door)

1:06:59.347 --> 1:07:00.870
- The journals?

1:07:00.870 --> 1:07:02.163
- They're gone, taken.

1:07:03.930 --> 1:07:05.470
I saw Iris.

1:07:05.470 --> 1:07:07.360
There's more to this than I thought.

1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:08.363
- [Winters] Yeah, tell me about it.

1:07:08.363 --> 1:07:10.000
- [Alan] What do you have?

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:11.650
- They're recordings being left in each

1:07:11.650 --> 1:07:13.300
of the apartments in the building.

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:15.980
Layers under layers under layers of sound.

1:07:15.980 --> 1:07:17.490
There's a message in here somewhere.

1:07:17.490 --> 1:07:19.750
- Help me. I need your help to figure ...

1:07:19.750 --> 1:07:20.900
I have pieces.

1:07:20.900 --> 1:07:21.733
Okay, do you understand?

1:07:21.733 --> 1:07:26.430
I have pieces that I need to
find out how they fit together.

1:07:26.430 --> 1:07:27.900
I don't know how to do that.

1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:29.123
- Neither do I, kid.

1:07:30.260 --> 1:07:32.400
You started to remember
when you were little,

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:33.990
but Marie stopped you.

1:07:33.990 --> 1:07:34.840
You remember how?

1:07:37.190 --> 1:07:38.023
Sounds.

1:07:39.540 --> 1:07:42.060
She made you listen to different sounds.

1:07:42.060 --> 1:07:44.000
You'd think of something horrible.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.790
She shifted your attention.

1:07:45.790 --> 1:07:47.090
Now look at what you do for a living?

1:07:47.090 --> 1:07:48.460
Huh? Boom.

1:07:48.460 --> 1:07:51.060
You've buried your memories
a little more every day.

1:07:52.390 --> 1:07:53.340
- Do you hear that?

1:07:56.050 --> 1:07:57.300
When I was little, I was,

1:07:58.893 --> 1:08:02.140
I was held captive somewhere by my father.

1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:06.650
We were kept in small
rooms, no outside contact.

1:08:06.650 --> 1:08:08.350
- You've regressed back to that time.

1:08:08.350 --> 1:08:09.880
Now you're holding yourself prisoner.

1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:11.343
- My father, he,

1:08:14.134 --> 1:08:18.059
he would lure people back
to the house somehow,

1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:21.660
and he'd bring them in the garage and,

1:08:24.979 --> 1:08:26.362
he'd butcher them.

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:30.610
The same way he'd butcher deer,

1:08:30.610 --> 1:08:33.780
the same way he would rip off their skin

1:08:33.780 --> 1:08:34.850
and take out their organs,

1:08:34.850 --> 1:08:35.897
he butchered the people the same way,

1:08:35.897 --> 1:08:39.300
and this song, this song,
it would play over and over

1:08:39.300 --> 1:08:42.830
and over again, and Iris,
Mom, she went crazy,

1:08:42.830 --> 1:08:44.647
and then she started
seeing things and hearing--

1:08:44.647 --> 1:08:46.206
- Kid kid, kid kid.

1:08:46.206 --> 1:08:47.120
Listen to me.

1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:50.069
Marie mentioned a woman
who was interested in you.

1:08:50.069 --> 1:08:53.010
And when you were young,
you had dreams of a girl.

1:08:53.010 --> 1:08:54.510
Could they be the same person?

1:08:55.916 --> 1:08:57.223
(knocking on door)

1:08:57.223 --> 1:08:58.226
- [Computerized Voice] Maggie.

1:08:58.226 --> 1:08:59.469
Six.

1:08:59.469 --> 1:09:00.753
- Leonard probably.

1:09:01.753 --> 1:09:04.920
(soft dramatic music)

1:09:07.715 --> 1:09:11.134
- Stay the fuck away from my bitch.

1:09:11.134 --> 1:09:12.350
- [Alan] What the fuck are you doing?

1:09:12.350 --> 1:09:13.521
(punches striking)

1:09:13.521 --> 1:09:16.438
(Winters groaning)

1:09:19.528 --> 1:09:21.778
(groaning)

1:09:27.714 --> 1:09:30.464
(hard breathing)

1:09:35.350 --> 1:09:37.987
- Rosie, what are you doing here?

1:09:39.170 --> 1:09:40.003
- Sorry.

1:09:40.947 --> 1:09:43.147
Shawn really did a
number on you, didn't he?

1:09:44.530 --> 1:09:45.462
He's gone now.

1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:48.353
I'm not sure for how long, but oh.

1:09:49.979 --> 1:09:54.219
After he beat you, I
finally stood up to him.

1:09:54.219 --> 1:09:55.990
I told him that he was
probably gonna take the fall

1:09:55.990 --> 1:09:59.150
for Harris' death, and
I wasn't gonna deny it.

1:09:59.150 --> 1:10:00.773
- Harris, what are you talking about?

1:10:01.889 --> 1:10:04.460
- They found him a couple hours ago.

1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:06.090
Mrs. Arenberg found him.

1:10:06.090 --> 1:10:07.648
- Mrs. Arenberg?

1:10:07.648 --> 1:10:12.190
- Yeah, apparently her dryer
didn't get fixed properly,

1:10:12.190 --> 1:10:14.290
and so she went to complain about it,

1:10:14.290 --> 1:10:17.870
and she found him there,
cut from head to toe.

1:10:17.870 --> 1:10:18.870
- My friend Alan ...

1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:23.630
My dad, did you see him here?

1:10:23.630 --> 1:10:26.883
- No, just Shawn and that woman.

1:10:30.398 --> 1:10:31.797
I wanted to say thank you.

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:36.950
- For what?

1:10:36.950 --> 1:10:39.000
Another notch on the long
list of getting my ass kicked?

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:39.923
Don't mention it.

1:10:43.950 --> 1:10:45.200
- For sticking up for me.

1:10:46.210 --> 1:10:49.083
I'm gonna go, and I'm not coming back.

1:10:50.490 --> 1:10:52.657
Stay safe, okay, neighbor?

1:10:52.657 --> 1:10:55.574

(soft dramatic music)

1:11:22.329 --> 1:11:23.162
- Hey.

1:11:25.050 --> 1:11:25.883
Hey.

1:11:27.507 --> 1:11:28.340
Hey.

1:11:29.768 --> 1:11:30.728
Fuck.

1:11:43.870 --> 1:11:44.800
Kill.

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:48.954
Six, seven, six.

(soft dramatic music)

1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:11.860
- [Maggie] He left your door unlocked?

1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:13.070
- Yes.

1:13:13.070 --> 1:13:14.469
- [Maggie] Go get help, now.

1:19:04.829 --> 1:19:06.829
- Please don't be angry.

1:19:08.282 --> 1:19:11.591
I never wanted to hurt anybody.

1:19:11.591 --> 1:19:14.091
I didn't wanna be duplicitous.

1:19:15.893 --> 1:19:17.059
- Duplicitous?

1:19:21.915 --> 1:19:23.332
- Deceitful, sly.

1:19:27.483 --> 1:19:28.316
Sneaky.

1:19:32.130 --> 1:19:32.963
- Leonard?

1:19:36.540 --> 1:19:37.687
You've been useful.

1:19:39.777 --> 1:19:42.527
(dramatic music)

1:19:43.930 --> 1:19:45.834
- No, no, no no.

1:19:45.834 --> 1:19:49.001
(soft dramatic music)

1:19:54.574 --> 1:19:56.508
You were the best boss.

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:56.160
You remember what I
showed you on the beach?

1:20:57.787 --> 1:21:00.954
(soft dramatic music)

1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:05.433
- Maggie?

1:21:12.650 --> 1:21:13.483
Hello?

1:21:15.592 --> 1:21:16.759
- [Maggie] Hi.

1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:19.633
- [Winters] Maggie, is that you?

1:21:21.215 --> 1:21:22.693
I can't believe it.

1:21:22.693 --> 1:21:25.861
(soft dramatic music)

1:21:28.657 --> 1:21:29.857
- Did you say hi to Dad?

1:21:31.361 --> 1:21:33.543
- [Winters] What have
you done to those people?

1:21:33.543 --> 1:21:35.403
- They're not people anymore.

1:21:37.430 --> 1:21:39.023
Marie was my favorite.

1:21:40.344 --> 1:21:43.164
- I would have died for you.

1:21:43.164 --> 1:21:45.394
- It's not too late for that.

1:21:45.394 --> 1:21:48.561
(soft dramatic music)

1:21:57.213 --> 1:22:00.880

1:22:42.208 --> 1:22:44.958
(hard breathing)

1:22:47.205 --> 1:22:50.046
- Alan, Alan.

1:22:50.046 --> 1:22:52.557
- They don't make me like
they used to, huh, kid?

1:22:55.817 --> 1:22:58.017
- You finally came to
help with my mix tape.

1:22:58.930 --> 1:22:59.920
How neighborly.

1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:01.420
- What the fuck is your problem already?

1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:03.330
- That bitch made you forget about me.

1:23:03.330 --> 1:23:05.780
That's my fucking problem.

1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:07.253
I came to make you remember.

1:23:08.309 --> 1:23:10.980
- So that's what this is about, revenge?

1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:12.112
How original.

1:23:13.001 --> 1:23:15.760
I remember everything
now. Can we all go home?

1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:17.713
- Prove it. Prove you remember.

1:23:19.700 --> 1:23:22.541
Tell me how it started.
Tell me how it began.

1:23:22.541 --> 1:23:24.880
- It began.
- Tell me.

1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.260
- Wait wait wait.

1:23:26.260 --> 1:23:30.800
It began when Mom
started to lose her grip.

1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:33.109
Dad, Dad snapped.

1:23:33.109 --> 1:23:33.942
- Then what?

1:23:33.942 --> 1:23:36.554
- He wouldn't let us outside,
kept us in our rooms.

1:23:36.554 --> 1:23:37.387
He kept us prisoner.

1:23:37.387 --> 1:23:38.219
- And?

1:23:40.210 --> 1:23:41.160
- He killed people.

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:46.003
He brought them home, and he killed them.

1:23:51.227 --> 1:23:52.227
He made you.

1:23:55.016 --> 1:23:56.766
He made you help him.

1:23:59.148 --> 1:24:03.321
The way you helped him
before when we'd go hunting.

1:24:03.321 --> 1:24:04.840
The way you helped him
gut and skin the deer,

1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:07.082
he made you help with the people.

1:24:07.082 --> 1:24:09.165
(crying)

1:24:10.263 --> 1:24:11.773
You protected me.

1:24:14.580 --> 1:24:19.500
- From our rooms, we'd
hear the bad noises,

1:24:19.500 --> 1:24:23.362
so we made up our own games.

1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:29.893
Knocking on the walls,
talking through them, singing.

1:24:29.893 --> 1:24:30.732
Do you remember?

1:24:30.732 --> 1:24:32.165
- Yeah I do.

1:24:32.165 --> 1:24:33.360
When he came home, he knew I left,

1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:36.030
and so he beat me up and
he messed me up here,

1:24:36.030 --> 1:24:37.153
and then when, when,

1:24:39.053 --> 1:24:41.143
when he saw that I was broken,

1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:44.330
he saw that I couldn't remember things,

1:24:44.330 --> 1:24:47.750
he abandoned me and he abandoned Mom.

1:24:47.750 --> 1:24:49.805
What did he do to you?

1:24:49.805 --> 1:24:52.972
(soft dramatic music)

1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:56.733
- He sold me.

1:24:59.889 --> 1:25:01.133
He let men rape me.

1:25:04.467 --> 1:25:06.380
I was just a little girl.

1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:10.443
I was just a little girl.

1:25:12.641 --> 1:25:13.967
(crying)

1:25:13.967 --> 1:25:15.103
But I was strong.

1:25:18.318 --> 1:25:19.151
And you,

1:25:20.261 --> 1:25:21.964
you were a coward.

1:25:21.964 --> 1:25:24.003
You could have gone for help
that day, and you didn't.

1:25:25.016 --> 1:25:27.118
Then someone would havee found me,

1:25:27.118 --> 1:25:28.868
and I coulda had a normal life too.

1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:32.303
You had everything.

1:25:34.530 --> 1:25:37.330
And all this time, you never
had to remember a goddam thing.

1:25:37.330 --> 1:25:38.960
- Wait, no no no, you're wrong.

1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:41.250
I did remember you, just not
in the way that you thought.

1:25:41.250 --> 1:25:43.430
- You are such a liar.

1:25:43.430 --> 1:25:44.263
- Stop it.

1:25:44.263 --> 1:25:45.223
You read the journals.

1:25:46.639 --> 1:25:49.610
That day Marie found me,
I whispered something

1:25:49.610 --> 1:25:51.660
into that seashell, you read that, right?

1:25:54.150 --> 1:25:56.523
Remember what I whispered into it now?

1:25:59.230 --> 1:26:00.357
It was your name.

1:26:02.670 --> 1:26:04.663
You showed me that, do you remember?

1:26:05.690 --> 1:26:07.820
How to make a wish if you
couldn't see the stars.

1:26:07.820 --> 1:26:09.410
That's the last thing I did

1:26:09.410 --> 1:26:11.059
before I forgot about everything.

1:26:14.438 --> 1:26:16.728
You were my wish.

1:26:16.728 --> 1:26:18.380
(crying)

1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:20.130
That's why I can't have
normal relationships.

1:26:20.130 --> 1:26:21.820
That's why I couldn't deal
with Marie getting sick,

1:26:21.820 --> 1:26:24.620
because I was going to lose
her the way that I lost you.

1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:30.297
Losing you,

1:26:36.100 --> 1:26:37.343
that's what broke me.

1:26:39.969 --> 1:26:42.719
(hard breathing)

1:26:43.559 --> 1:26:46.420
Please, let Alan go.

1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:48.500
He never asked to be
a part of any of this.

1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:51.059
Kill me, do whatever you
want. Just let him go, please.

1:26:51.059 --> 1:26:52.210
- Why would I kill you?

1:26:56.070 --> 1:26:57.687
Now that I have you.

1:27:01.370 --> 1:27:02.593
You're my baby brother.

1:27:04.750 --> 1:27:05.873
You're home now.

1:27:07.633 --> 1:27:09.653
- Are you gonna lock me in a room?

1:27:11.092 --> 1:27:14.259
(soft dramatic music)

1:27:17.139 --> 1:27:18.430
- Do you still love me?

1:27:21.875 --> 1:27:22.992
- Yeah, I do.

1:27:22.992 --> 1:27:26.159
(soft dramatic music)

1:27:27.327 --> 1:27:28.161
- Good.

1:27:31.573 --> 1:27:33.231
(dramatic music)

1:27:33.231 --> 1:27:35.230
- What are you doing? No, no, no, Maggie.

1:27:35.230 --> 1:27:36.063
- Stop, stop.

1:27:36.063 --> 1:27:36.896
- Maggie no, no.

1:27:36.896 --> 1:27:37.813
No, no, no.

1:27:45.603 --> 1:27:46.436
Fuck.

1:27:47.806 --> 1:27:49.191
Fuck!

1:27:49.191 --> 1:27:52.358
(soft dramatic music)

1:27:54.343 --> 1:27:55.175
No.

1:27:57.262 --> 1:27:59.181
No no, no no, no.

1:27:59.181 --> 1:28:00.598
- It's all right.

1:28:01.465 --> 1:28:02.483
Hey, hey.

1:28:02.483 --> 1:28:03.689
- No.
- Come on.

1:28:03.689 --> 1:28:04.713
- No, no, no.

1:28:04.713 --> 1:28:07.463
(hard breathing)

1:28:09.812 --> 1:28:10.853
- Come on.

1:28:10.853 --> 1:28:12.568
It's all right, it's all right.

1:28:12.568 --> 1:28:13.702
Come on.

1:28:13.702 --> 1:28:15.994
Here we go. Here we go, come on.

1:28:15.994 --> 1:28:17.411
Come on, come on.

1:28:20.742 --> 1:28:22.121
Help me up.

1:28:22.121 --> 1:28:24.263
Come on, come on, come on.

1:28:24.263 --> 1:28:25.180
Help me up.

1:28:26.896 --> 1:28:29.835
(groaning)

1:28:29.835 --> 1:28:33.003
(soft dramatic music)

1:28:35.034 --> 1:28:37.568
- [Maggie] Remember me.

1:28:37.568 --> 1:28:39.342
- It's all right, come on.

1:28:39.342 --> 1:28:40.259
Here we go.

1:28:43.611 --> 1:28:46.299
(crickets chirping)

1:28:46.299 --> 1:28:47.132
It's okay.

1:28:49.219 --> 1:28:51.636
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1:28:53.496 --> 1:28:54.330
Oh yikes.

1:28:55.657 --> 1:28:58.657
(crickets chirping)

1:29:01.508 --> 1:29:03.862
(dog barking)

1:29:03.862 --> 1:29:06.362
(owl hooting)

1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:21.927
- Hey, that's the last of it?

1:29:21.927 --> 1:29:23.120
- Yeah.

1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:24.730
- Cool, now what do you say we do

1:29:24.730 --> 1:29:26.639
a little pizza and beer tonight?

1:29:26.639 --> 1:29:27.740
- That sounds amazing?

1:29:28.930 --> 1:29:30.670
- I'll go hook us up.

1:29:30.670 --> 1:29:33.074
- Hey, Alan.

1:29:33.074 --> 1:29:33.907
- Huh?

1:29:35.380 --> 1:29:37.960
- Thanks again for letting me stay.

1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:39.248
I won't be a nuisance.

1:29:39.248 --> 1:29:41.200
- Hey, hey hey.
