IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.436 --> 00:05.639
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.409
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.442 --> 00:10.278

00:10.311 --> 00:11.712

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.617
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.153
HELP, HELP!

00:19.187 --> 00:20.754
ANTHONY, WHAT'S WRONG?
ANTHONY, BABY, WHAT HAPPENED?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.156
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:22.190 --> 00:23.424
[growling]

00:23.457 --> 00:26.594
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.796
HONEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST YOUR SILLY AUNT NIKKI.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.631
TAKE A PILL, ERICA.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.100
WE'RE JUST PLAYING.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.767
[growls]

00:33.801 --> 00:35.503
OH, NO, ANTHONY.
WAIT, NO.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.071
NO, THAT'S ICKY.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.239
LET ME SEE.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.607
PIZZA'S ON THE WAY UP.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.142
HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY PURSE?

00:41.175 --> 00:42.176
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE A GUEST HERE.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.177
YOU DON'T PAY.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.412
OH, BUT, DADDY.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.214
OH, ERICA, DON'T ARGUE
WITH YOUR FATHER.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.848
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S ALREADY UP
'CAUSE I'M KICKING HIS ASS.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.618
HEY, LANGUAGE.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.620
OH, HEY, ANTHONY.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.622
PINCH HIT FOR GRANDMA.
I'M GONNA GO GET OUR DINNER.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.823
OKAY, IT'S ME AND YOU, BUDDY.
IT'S ME AND YOU.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.125
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.093
GO AHEAD.
YOU GOT NOTHING.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.561
YOU GOT NOTHING.
OKAY, THERE'S NO WAY--

01:00.594 --> 01:02.563
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.566
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE PERSON
WITH THE PIZZA.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.468
CAN--CAN I HELP YOU?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.837
IT'S ME.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.072
EXCUSE ME?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.777
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.817
OH, MY GOD, MOM.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.123
IT'S HEATHER.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.135
(Freeland)
Heather Hallander.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.371
VANISHED FOUR YEARS AGO
WHEN SHE WAS 14.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.139
THIS IS HER ENTIRE
MISSING PERSON'S FILE?

01:45.173 --> 01:47.608
YEAH, 450,000 KIDS
RUN AWAY EVER YEAR.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.210
TEENAGER DON'T WANT
TO BE FOUND,

01:49.243 --> 01:50.278
THERE'S NOT MUCH
WE CAN DO.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.479
WHY DID SHE RUN AWAY?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.314
SHE DIDN'T,
BUT THAT'S HOW IT LOOKED.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.548
THE WEEK SHE DISAPPEARED

01:54.582 --> 01:55.849
SHE WAS FIGHTING
WITH HER PARENTS.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.285
THEY WERE PLANNING
TO SHIP HER OFF.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.286
(Stabler)
REFORM SCHOOL?

01:58.319 --> 01:59.853
FAT CAMP.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.322
NOT AN OUNCE OF FAT ON HER
ANYMORE THOUGH.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.160
WENT ON A FOUR-YEAR
KILLER DIET,

02:06.194 --> 02:09.163
BEING HELD
AS A SEX SLAVE.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.683
SHE'S BACK
IN HER OLD ROOM.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.485
WE LEFT IT EXACTLY
LIKE IT WAS,

03:04.518 --> 03:06.754
SO HOPEFULLY
THAT'LL HELP.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.659
HEATHER, SWEETHEART,

03:11.692 --> 03:13.927
THE POLICE ARE HERE
TO SPEAK TO YOU.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.429
(Heather)
I ALREADY TALKED
TO THE POLICE.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.431
HAS SHE GIVEN YOU
ANY DETAILS?

03:17.465 --> 03:18.732
NO.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.867
EXCUSE ME.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.436
HEATHER,
IT'S DETECTIVE OLIVIA BENSON.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.372
I KNOW THIS IS PAINFUL
TO TALK ABOUT,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.874
BUT RIGHT NOW
THE TIME IS CRITICAL.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.443
WHY WON'T
SHE COOPERATE?

03:29.477 --> 03:30.478
NIKKI, PLEASE,
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.545
YOU'RE HEATHER'S SISTER?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.546
THE SCREW-UP
MIDDLE CHILD,

03:32.580 --> 03:33.814
NOT THE SAINTED
OLDER ONE.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.349
(Mrs. Hallander)
NIKKI.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.718
HEATHER'S DISAPPEARANCE
WAS VERY HARD ON NIKKI.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.420
'CAUSE IT WAS ALL
MY FAULT, RIGHT?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.322
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

03:41.355 --> 03:42.656
ASK HEATHER.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.858
ASK HER WHAT I CALLED HER
TO MAKE HER CRY

03:44.892 --> 03:46.827
AND RUN OUT THE DOOR,
NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.463
NIKKI, STOP IT.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.333
I USED TO CALL HEATHER
"HEIFER."

03:52.366 --> 03:54.535
I NEVER BLAMED YOU, NIKKI.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.870
NOT ONCE. I SWEAR.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.038
SHE'S ALREADY SHOWERED.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.340
(Nikki)
THREE TIMES.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.543
HOPE NOBODY ELSE
NEEDED HOT WATER.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.816
I WAS FIRST CHAIR CLARINET.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.286
HE GRABBED ME THE DAY
BEFORE THE SPRING CONCERT.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.754
WHO GRABBED YOU,
HEATHER?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.889
A MAN.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.458
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.360
I DON'T KNOW.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.894
WERE YOU WITH HIM
THIS WHOLE TIME?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.563
YEAH.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.532
IN FOUR YEARS, YOU MUST
HAVE CALLED HIM SOMETHING.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.404
HE MADE ME CALL HIM "DADDY."

04:30.438 --> 04:32.072
WHERE DID HE KEEP YOU?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.941
IN A CONCRETE ROOM.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.509
DO YOU KNOW WHERE?

04:35.543 --> 04:36.610
DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS?

04:36.644 --> 04:39.913
I DON'T KNOW.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.949
HEATHER,
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.520
HE WAS DRUNK.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.323
FORGOT TO PUT THE PADLOCK
ON THE DOOR, SO I RAN.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.758
SO IT WAS SOMEWHERE
IN THE CITY?

04:50.791 --> 04:53.861
I CAME OUT
INTO A BASEMENT,

04:53.894 --> 04:55.496
UP SOME STAIRS,
AND ONTO THE STREET.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.830
I RAN UNTIL I COULDN'T
RUN ANYMORE.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.866
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHICH WAS I WAS GOING

04:58.899 --> 05:00.668
UNTIL I GOT
TO THE PARK.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.405
WHAT IS THAT HE
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED YOU?

05:07.541 --> 05:09.042
YESTERDAY.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.846
OKAY, WE NEED TO GET YOU
TO A HOSPITAL

05:12.880 --> 05:15.549
SO YOU CAN GET EXAMINED
BY A DOCTOR.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.884
THEN WE'D LIKE YOU
TO COME ALONG WITH US,

05:16.917 --> 05:21.389
SEE IF YOU CAN LEAD US BACK
TO WHERE HE KEPT YOU.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.991
ARE THOSE THE CLOTHES
YOU WORE?

05:24.024 --> 05:25.626
YEAH.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.132
DO YOU HAVE YOUR UNDERWEAR?

05:32.165 --> 05:35.703
HE NEVER LET ME WEAR ANY.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.273
(Benson)
HOW DID HE GET YOU?

05:40.307 --> 05:45.145
(Heather)
AFTER I RAN OUT
OF THE APARTMENT,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.847
I CRIED FOR, LIKE,
THREE BLOCKS.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.016
AND THEN I NOTICED A MAN
WAS WALKING NEXT TO ME.

05:49.049 --> 05:53.053
HE SAID I WAS TOO PRETTY
TO BE CRYING.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.423
WE GOT TO HIS VAN,
HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING

05:55.456 --> 05:57.691
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.159
(Benson)
YOU WENT INTO THE VAN?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.728
(Heather)
NO, HE PUT A HANDKERCHIEF

06:00.761 --> 06:03.631
OVER MY MOUTH WITH SOME KIND
OF CHEMICAL ON IT.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.634
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER
BEFORE I WOKE UP.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.737
(Benson)
WHERE WAS THAT?

06:09.770 --> 06:12.072
(Heather)
ON A CONCRETE FLOOR.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.042
IT WAS PITCH BLACK.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.445
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY CLOTHES ON.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.981
I STOOD UP AND FELT
ALONG THE WALLS,

06:21.014 --> 06:22.716
SCREAMING FOR HELP.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.151
I GOT TO A METAL DOOR

06:24.184 --> 06:28.121
AND STARTED POUNDING ON IT.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.623
THERE WAS A MATTRESS.

06:29.657 --> 06:33.861
I LAID DOWN ON IT
AND CRIED.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
I MUST'VE FALLEN ASLEEP.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.498
I WOKE UP
WHEN HE CAME IN.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.767
HE PUT A COMBINATION LOCK

06:39.800 --> 06:42.770
ON THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.038
HE GOT ON TOP OF ME.

06:45.072 --> 06:49.710
I KICKED AND SCREAMED
AND HIT.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.013
HE SAID HE'D COME BACK
WHEN I WAS READY TO BE SWEET.

06:53.046 --> 06:57.551
HE SAID IF I COULDN'T BE NICE
HE'D LET ME STARVE TO DEATH.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.053
I THOUGHT I MADE IT
ABOUT A WEEK WITHOUT EATING.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.692
HE SAID IT WAS ONLY
TWO DAYS.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.760
(Stabler)
HE KEPT YOU IN THIS ROOM
THE WHOLE TIME?

07:09.162 --> 07:11.665
YEAH.

07:11.699 --> 07:15.669
WERE THERE
ANY WINDOWS?

07:15.703 --> 07:16.937
NO.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.773
RUNNING WATER?

07:19.807 --> 07:23.544
JUST ONE OF THOSE
OLD-TIME BATHTUBS

07:23.577 --> 07:24.778
WITH THE LEGS.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.580
CLAW-FOOT TUB.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.915
IT WASN'T HOOKED UP
TO ANYTHING THOUGH.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.218
HE, UH--

07:31.251 --> 07:32.720
WHEN HE WANTED ME
TO BATHE MYSELF

07:32.753 --> 07:35.188
OR BRUSH MY TEETH,
HE'D LOWER A GARDEN HOSE

07:35.222 --> 07:39.493
DOWN THROUGH A HOLE
IN THE CEILING.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.795
WHAT DID YOU USE
FOR A TOILET?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.833
A LAWN CHAIR

07:45.866 --> 07:48.869
WITH THE SEAT CUT OUT
OVER A BUCKET.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.644
CAN I GO NOW?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.679
I JUST REALLY WANT TO BE
WITH MY FAMILY.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.782
HEATHER, WE KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.685
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT HE
COULD SNATCH ANOTHER GIRL

08:04.718 --> 08:06.720
TO REPLACE YOU.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.823
CAN YOU HANG IN THERE WITH US
JUST A LITTLE LONGER?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.792
MAYBE HELP US FIND HIM?

08:15.295 --> 08:17.197
THIS IS THE FIRST SPOT
I REMEMBER KNOWING WHERE I WAS.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.700
WHICH WAY'D
YOU COME FROM?

08:19.733 --> 08:22.736
DID YOU CROSS
FIFTH AVENUE?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.605
DO YOU REMEMBER
SEEING A FOUNTAIN?

08:24.638 --> 08:26.006
NO.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.308
NO.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.711
I CAME FROM OVER THERE.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.749
I REMEMBER
THE GREEN AWNING.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.851
I COULD SMELL THE FLOWERS
AS I RAN BY.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.052
ARE YOU SURE IT'S THIS ONE?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.821
A LOT OF THESE PLACES
SELL FLOWERS.
NO, I'M POSITIVE.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.656
I TURNED DOWN
AT THE CORNER.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.893
THERE'S A FUNERAL HOME
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.827
IT'S ONLY SIX OR SEVEN
BLOCKS FROM HERE.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.929
AND IT WAS WHAT, LIKE,
A BROWNSTONE?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.731
I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS DARK.
I JUST RAN.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.299
DID HE WEAR ANY KIND
OF UNIFORM?

08:52.332 --> 08:54.134
ANYTHING WITH
A BUSINESS NAME ON IT?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.803
NO.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.938
DID HE HAVE A GUN?
NO.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.673
YOU THINK I'M DISGUSTING

08:59.707 --> 09:01.842
FOR NOT ESCAPING SOONER,
DON'T YOU?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.176
HEY.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.178
I DON'T THINK THAT
AT ALL.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.347
I DREAMED ABOUT FINDING
SOMETHING TO STAB HIM WITH

09:07.380 --> 09:09.917
EVERY TIME HE WAS ON ME,
BUT WHEN HE CAME IN THAT ROOM

09:09.950 --> 09:11.619
HE PUT THE COMBINATION LOCK
ON THE DOOR.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.820
HE SAID IF ANYTHING
HAPPENED TO HIM,

09:12.853 --> 09:13.821
I'D DIE DOWN THERE.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.923
(Stabler)
NO FUNERAL HOME.

09:15.956 --> 09:16.857
WHAT?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.025
NO, THERE HAS TO BE.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.192
WELL, IT'S OKAY.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.260
MAYBE IT'S ANOTHER
BLOCK DOWN.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.328
NO, IT WAS ON
THE SAME BLOCK.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.063
MAYBE WE WENT THE WRONG WAY
BACK AT THE SUBWAY.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.865
[tires squealing,
horns honking]
AHH!

09:24.898 --> 09:26.934
HEATHER, HEATHER, CALM DOWN.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.336
I CAN'T DO THIS.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.771
WHY DON'T WE GO
BACK TO THE CAR.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.805
LET'S GO BACK TO THE CAR.
I JUST--

09:31.839 --> 09:33.807
WE'RE GONNA SIT SOMEPLACE QUIET
FOR A SECOND.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.242
NO WORRIES.
OKAY?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.110
CAN WE JUST DO THIS
TOMORROW?

09:37.144 --> 09:38.646
I JUST,
I WANT TO SEE MY FAMILY.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.913
I WANT TO GO HOME.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, YES.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.215
PLEASE, I JUST WANT
TO SEE MY MOM.
OKAY.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.687
WE'LL PICK YOU UP TOMORROW
AT 9:00, OKAY?
OKAY.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.689
IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN,

09:48.722 --> 09:52.025
HEATHER, I WANT YOU
TO CALL ME ANY TIME.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.794
SORRY I WAS SO USELESS.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.063
IT'S HARD TO THINK.
MY BODY ACHES.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.865
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAID YOU HAVE
QUITE A VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY

09:57.898 --> 09:59.032
FROM LACK OF SUNLIGHT.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.801
Heather Hallander!

10:00.834 --> 10:02.102
HEATHER, OVER HERE!
OVER HERE!

10:02.135 --> 10:03.203
HARRIS FROM THE LEDGER.
COME ON.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.071
DID HE JUST TAKE
MY PICTURE?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.939
HEATHER, CAN I GET
A QUICK STATEMENT?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.240
CALL DCPI, THEY'LL
GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.241
DO YOU HAVE ANY WORDS
FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH--

10:08.275 --> 10:09.910
ARE THEY GONNA
PRINT MY PHOTO?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.645
NOT IF HE HAS
A CONSCIENCE.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.813
HEATHER,
WHAT WAS THE LOWEST POINT

10:12.846 --> 10:13.981
OF YOUR FOUR YEARS
IN CAPTIVITY?

10:14.014 --> 10:14.715
YOU TAKE A STEP
IN THAT BUILDING,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
I'LL ARREST YOU
FOR TRESPASSING.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.284
YOU, BE A HUMAN BEING.
ERASE THE PHOTOS.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.351
WHAT WORLD
DO YOU LIVE IN?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.287
CUTE, MIDDLE-CLASS
WHITE GIRL

10:20.320 --> 10:22.122
HELD AS A SEX SLAVE.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.123
THE STORY'S HUGE.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.258
I ASKED YOU NICE ONCE.
COME ON.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.127
I'M ASKING YOU NICE.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.229
SON OF A BITCH.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.965
THAT'S A SHAME.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.267
LOOKS EXPENSIVE.

10:34.301 --> 10:39.306
$4,595 FOR ONE
35mm DIGITAL CAMERA.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.375
AND THE LEDGER IS DEMANDING
DISCIPLINARY ACTION

10:42.409 --> 10:43.911
BE TAKEN AGAINST YOU.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.178
I NEVER TOUCHED
THE GUY.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.014
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THE VULTURES GOT A PHOTO

10:47.047 --> 10:48.215
OFF THEIR MEMORY CARD.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.183
"SEX SLAVE
AND THE CITY."

10:50.217 --> 10:51.819
CLASSY.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.887
USED TO BE NO ONE WOULD EVER
PUBLISH A RAPE VICTIM'S PHOTO.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.689
WELL, THAT WAS BEFORE
NEWSPAPERS STARTED GOING

10:55.723 --> 10:56.990
THE WAY OF THE DODO.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.827
I'M SURE READERSHIP
WILL BE UP TODAY.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.794
SORRY, CAPTAIN,

11:00.828 --> 11:02.963
I'VE GOT HEATHER HALLANDER'S
SISTER OUT HERE,

11:02.996 --> 11:03.897
AND SHE'S NOT TOO HAPPY.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.133
SHE WANTS TO TALK
TO THE PERSON IN CHARGE.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.870
LET HER IN.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.371
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.774
HASN'T MY SISTER
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH TORTURE?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.943
HAS HEATHER SEEN IT?
NO.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.344
I CALLED MY PARENTS
AND TOLD THEM

11:17.377 --> 11:19.046
TO MAKE SURE
SHE DIDN'T.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.914
GOOD; I PROMISE YOU
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

11:20.948 --> 11:22.249
TO KEEP THE PRESS
AWAY FROM HER TODAY.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.483
SHE IS SCARED TO DEATH

11:23.516 --> 11:25.352
SAFE AT HOME
WITH HER OWN FAMILY.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.821
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
DRAGGING HER THROUGH THE CITY?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.890
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND
HER ABDUCTOR.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.925
YOU'RE WORSE THAN
THE MISSING PERSON'S DETECTIVE.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.161
ALL HE EVER DID
WAS CALL US ONCE A MONTH

11:34.194 --> 11:35.963
TO SEE IF WE'D
HEARD FROM HER.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.198
I HAD TO START MY OWN WEBSITE
ASKING FOR TIPS.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.768
DID YOU GET ANY
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.702
NO.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.042
I WAS AT THE APARTMENT
THE DAY IT HAPPENED.

11:49.076 --> 11:53.113
SHE RAN RIGHT BY ME
OUT THE DOOR.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.315
I SHOULDA GONE AFTER HER.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.424
(Benson)
THAT WAS HEATHER'S FATHER.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.459
SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL.
DRIVE-ALONG'S OFF.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.796
SHE SAW THE PAPER.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.030
THEY TRIED
TO KEEP IT FROM HER,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.198
BUT THE SISTER NIKKI
SLIPPED HER A COPY.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.066
THE BRAT SISTER
ISN'T HELPING AT ALL.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.235
YOU ASK ME, WE BRING NIKKI
IN HERE FOR A SIT-DOWN.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.236
WHAT ARE YOU,
A SOCIAL WORKER NOW?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.938
HARDLY.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.073
THE DAY HEATHER RAN OUT
AFTER NIKKI CALLED HER FAT,

12:20.107 --> 12:22.209
MOM SENT THE BRAT AFTER HE
TO APOLOGIZE.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.476
NIKKI NEVER FOUND HEATHER.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.912
YEAH, SO SHE CLAIMS.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.046
NIKKI WAS 16 YEARS OLD.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.281
WHAT'D SHE DO, SELL HER
YOUNGER SISTER AS A SEX SLAVE?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.183
NO, BUT MAYBE SHE SAW HER
GET IN THE VAN.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.284
AND NEVER SAID ANYTHING?

12:31.318 --> 12:34.321
NIKKI ADMITTED THAT
SHE TORMENTED HER LITTLE SISTER.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.323
MAYBE SHE WAS GLAD
TO SEE HER GO.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.792
PARENTS SAID THAT SHE'S BEEN
ON A DOWNWARD SPIRAL EVER SINCE.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.861
SOUNDS LIKE GUILT TO ME.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.095
OR ACTING LIKE A TEENAGER.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.464
ANYTHING BACK
FROM FORENSICS?

12:44.497 --> 12:46.399
SCARRING FROM
LONG-TERM SEXUAL ABUSE,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.001
BUT NO DNA
IN THE RAPE KIT.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.103
WELL, HEATHER SCRUBBED
HERSELF CLEAN.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.872
WE KIND OF EXPECTED THAT.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.106
THE LAB FOUND SEMEN
ON THE DRESS.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.042
THEY'RE WORKING UP
A DNA PROFILE NOW.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.043
IF WE'RE LUCKY, THE PERV'S
ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.377
(Munch)
HANG ON.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.279
GUYS, I GOT A TIP
FROM A CONCERNED CITIZEN.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.314
DIVINE INTERVENTION.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.819
(Father Mike)
I WAS CONFLICTED WHETHER
TO CALL YOU OR NOT.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.520
I PRAYED FOR GUIDANCE,

13:07.554 --> 13:10.090
AND THEN I FLIPPED
A COIN.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.893
LISTEN, FATHER, YOU POINT US
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

13:12.926 --> 13:15.228
WE'LL KEEP IT BETWEEN US
AND THE CONFESSIONAL.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.297
THE SEAL OF THE CONFESSIONAL
IS SACRED

13:17.330 --> 13:19.599
AND ABSOLUTE.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.035
IT'S NOTHING I HEARD.
IT'S SOMETHING I WITNESSED.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.271
IN THAT CASE,
IT'S KOSHER.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.011
THIS GIRL,
I'VE SEEN HER BEFORE.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.512
WHERE?

13:32.545 --> 13:34.247
AT MASS
THE LAST FOUR SUNDAYS.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.548
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS HEATHER?

13:35.582 --> 13:36.950
DID YOU TALK TO HER?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.051
I TRIED.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.020
IN A SEA OF FACES, THE ONES
IN TRUE SPIRITUAL CRISIS

13:40.053 --> 13:41.421
ALWAYS STAND OUT.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.124
I WANTED TO TALK TO HER,
BUT THEY ALWAYS CAME LATE

13:44.157 --> 13:46.559
AND THEN LEFT IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE SERVICE.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.128
THEY?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.063
AN OLDER GENTLEMAN.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.999
50s.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.167
HE'S ATTENDED OVER
THE YEARS INTERMITTENTLY.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.870
DO YOU HAVE HIS NAME
AND ADDRESS?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.106
HE'S NOT ON
OUR MEMBERSHIP ROLLS.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.241
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
DROPPING A DIME,

14:01.274 --> 14:05.879
BUT THE PAPER SAID
ANOTHER GIRL COULD BE AT RISK.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.447
WOULD IT HELP
IF I TALKED TO HEATHER?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.182
THANKS, FATHER,

14:09.216 --> 14:13.020
BUT WE NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN
REPORT A CONFESSION.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.555
HEATHER, THE MAN
THAT WAS HOLDING YOU,

14:15.588 --> 14:17.324
DID HE EVER
TAKE YOU OUTSIDE?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.126
NO, NEVER.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.128
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.234
WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO CATCH YOUR ABUSER.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.936
THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO REASON

14:28.969 --> 14:31.338
FOR YOU TO HOLD BACK
ANY IMPORTANT DETAILS.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.543
LIKE WHAT?

14:36.576 --> 14:40.047
LIKE ST. FRANCIS CATHEDRAL.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.551
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:49.456 --> 14:53.093
BASED ON YOUR REACTION,
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU DO.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.362
SOMEBODY SAW YOU THERE.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.097
THEY SAW YOU
WITH AN OLDER MAN.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.132
THEY'RE LYING.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.668
I REALLY WANT
TO HELP YOU.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.170
BUT I CAN'T

15:03.203 --> 15:04.571
UNLESS YOU'RE HONEST
WITH ME.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.705
I WANT YOU TO GO NOW.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.041
HEATHER, PLEASE,
LISTEN TO--

15:08.075 --> 15:09.209
GO!

15:09.242 --> 15:11.078
HE RAPED ME

15:11.111 --> 15:12.279
EVERY DAY.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.281
HE STOLE MY CHILDHOOD
FROM ME.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.149
AND IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME,

15:16.183 --> 15:19.486
THEN GET OUT!

15:19.519 --> 15:21.554
OKAY.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.128
WELL, OUTBURSTS OF RAGE
AREN'T UNHEARD OF

15:28.161 --> 15:29.462
IN A SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIM.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.597
IF SHE WAS ABUSED.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.000
WELL, FOR ALL WE KNOW
SHE RAN OFF WITH A BOYFRIEND.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.567
WHEN IT'S TIME TO COME HOME
AND FACE THE MUSIC,

15:34.601 --> 15:37.404
SHE CONCOCTS A STORY
THAT GETS HER SYMPATHY.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.272
BUT EVEN IF IT WAS
A BOYFRIEND, SHE WAS 14.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.307
IT'S STILL STAT RAPE.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.709
AND THE DOCTOR CONFIRMED
A VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.611
SHE WAS DEFINITELY
LOCKED UP AWAY

15:44.644 --> 15:46.179
OUT OF THE SUN FOR YEARS.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.480
(Munch)
NOT NECESSARILY.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.149
WHEN THE HOLE FORMED
IN THE OZONE LAYER,

15:49.182 --> 15:50.483
SKIN CANCERS INCREASED,

15:50.517 --> 15:53.120
OPENING UP BILLION-DOLLAR
DERMATOLOGY

15:53.153 --> 15:56.289
AND SUNSCREEN INDUSTRIES,
WHICH IN TURN HAVE CAUSED

15:56.323 --> 15:58.358
A MINI-EPIDEMIC
OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCIES.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.660
SO OUR CHANCES
ARE BONE DISEASE

16:00.693 --> 16:02.095
OR SKIN CANCER.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.296
YOU CAN'T WIN.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.332
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
MODERATION.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.333
OKAY, DOC,
WAS SHE ABDUCTED OR NOT?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.135
I WOULDN'T RULE IT OUT.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.769
EVEN WITH THE LIES ABOUT
HER FIELD TRIPS TO CHURCH?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.171
AFTER FOUR YEARS,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.706
HE'S ESTABLISHED
TOTAL DOMINATION OVER HER.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.443
HEATHER'S PROGRAMMED
TO FOLLOW ORDERS BLINDLY

16:16.476 --> 16:17.677
AND WITHOUT QUESTION.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.247
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF HIS POWER
IS TAKING HER OUT IN PUBLIC.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.248
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
BOTHER ME.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.515
I MEAN,
HE TOOK HER TO A CHURCH.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.251
YOU GOT 200 PEOPLE THERE,
IT'S A SANCTUARY.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.286
WHY NOT SCREAM,
ASK FOR HELP?

16:26.319 --> 16:29.556
BECAUSE HIS CONTROL OVER HER
WAS SO COMPLETE SHE COULDN'T.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.324
I ONCE WORKED A CASE
IN ROCHESTER

16:31.358 --> 16:32.725
WHERE THE PERP
TOOK A VICTIM

16:32.759 --> 16:34.327
WHO HE HAD KEPT
FOR TWO YEARS

16:34.361 --> 16:35.262
TO A KARAOKE BAR.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.264
THEY GOT UP AND THEY SANG
A SONG TOGETHER.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.465
NO ONE SUSPECTED.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.334
HEATHER IS SAFE NOW.
WHY ISN'T SHE HELPING?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.270
EXTREME STOCKHOLM SYNDROME.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.472
SHE'S BONDED WITH HER CAPTOR
AS A SURVIVAL MECHANISM

16:45.505 --> 16:48.475
AND NOW HAS THIS MISGUIDED
NEED TO PROTECT HIM.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.343
[phone rings]

16:50.377 --> 16:52.312
DETECTIVE BENSON.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.316
WHERE ARE THEY TAKING HER?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.385
I'M ON MY WAY.

16:58.418 --> 17:02.255
HEATHER SLIT HER WRISTS.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.456
HEATHER HALLANDER.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.158
THEY'RE BRINGING HER IN NOW.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.194
SHE'S TACHY AT 160.
LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.328
GRAB A SUTURE KIT.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.396
WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL
NOW, HONEY.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.663
EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.665
DO YOU KNOW HER BLOOD TYPE IN
CASE WE HAVE TO TRANSFUSE HER?

17:12.699 --> 17:13.800
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.135
"A."
WE'RE BOTH TYPE "A."

17:15.168 --> 17:17.104
TYPE AND CROSS
THREE UNITS OF "A."

17:17.137 --> 17:19.139
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT HERE.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.315
GOOD MORNING.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.084
HEARD YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER TODAY.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.653
YEAH, LIFE'S GREAT.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.524
HEATHER, I'M SORRY.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.627
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.264
I DIDN'T DO THIS
'CAUSE OF YOU.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.366
THEN WHY DID YOU DO IT?

17:46.399 --> 17:49.836
'CAUSE ALL THESE YEARS
I DREAMED

17:49.869 --> 17:54.441
OF BEING BACK WITH MY FAMILY.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.144
I'M A FREAK.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.113
I'M NEVER GONNA BELONG
ANYWHERE.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.815
HEATHER, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.353
YOUR FAMILY COULDN'T BEAR
TO LOSE YOU AGAIN.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.687
NOBODY'S COMFORTABLE
AROUND ME.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.122
NIKKI HATES ME.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.691
MY MOM CAN'T EVEN
LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.593
LISTEN TO ME, YOU'RE HAVING
A HARD TIME ADJUSTING.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.896
IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE TIME.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.765
AND COUNSELING.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.770
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.309
I KNOW YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IT RIGHT NOW,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.444
BUT BRINGING
YOUR ABUSER TO JUSTICE

18:31.478 --> 18:36.216
IS GONNA GO A LONG WAY
IN HELPING YOU HEAL.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.252
NOW YOU MAY HAVE BLOCKED OUT
SOME DETAILS,

18:39.286 --> 18:42.855
BUT YOU JUST TELL ME
WHEN YOU REMEMBER, OKAY?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.692
HEATHER?

18:47.727 --> 18:50.497
OKAY.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.765
HEATHER'S STABLE NOW,
BUT I'M PUTTING HER

18:52.799 --> 18:54.634
ON A 72-HOUR PSYCH HOLD
FOR EVALUATION.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.903
NOW, YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING
TO TRACK DOWN HER ABDUCTOR.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.407
YEAH, THE NURSES SHOWED ME
THE STORY IN THE LEDGER.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.475
WE CAN'T FIND HIM
WITHOUT HER.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.810
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S FOR HER OWN SAFETY.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.345
WHEN SHE WAS ON PAINKILLERS,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.347
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING
THAT COULD HELP US?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.216
NO.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.618
ANYTHING THAT SEEMED OFF?

19:21.628 --> 19:23.530
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S RELEVANT,

19:23.563 --> 19:25.198
BUT WHEN WE DETERMINE
A CHILD'S BLOOD TYPE

19:25.232 --> 19:27.267
THROUGH THEIR PARENTS,
WE ALWAYS PULL THE MOTHER ASIDE

19:27.300 --> 19:28.968
TO MAKE SURE THE FATHER
IS THE FATHER.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.370
IN CASE MOM CHEATED.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.971
AND MRS. HALLANDER
TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.540
THEY'RE BOTH TYPE "A,"

19:33.573 --> 19:35.508
WHICH MEANS HEATHER
CAN ONLY BE TYPE "A."
RIGHT.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.477
GOOD THING WE ALWAYS CONFIRM
WITH A RAPID AGGLUTINATION TEST

19:37.510 --> 19:40.947
TO COVER OUR ASSES
AGAINST MALPRACTICE.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.916
HEATHER IS TYPE "B."

19:43.950 --> 19:45.952
SHE'S NOT THEIR CHILD.

19:55.728 --> 19:56.829
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, THEY
SAID HEATHER WASN'T ADOPTED.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.965
MAYBE MRS. HALLANDER STEPPED OUT
FOR A LITTLE STRANGE.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.233
SHE DIDN'T.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.568
DR. MANNING SAID
WITH HER BLOOD TYPE

20:01.601 --> 20:03.470
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE GAVE BIRTH TO HEATHER.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.537
THAT LEAVES ONE POSSIBILITY--

20:04.571 --> 20:06.473
HEATHER IS NOT HEATHER.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.608
(Benson)
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.743
HOW COULD HER OWN FAMILY
NOT RECOGNIZE HER?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.512
THE AGE DIFFERENCE HELPED.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.314
WEIGHT LOSS DIDN'T HURT.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.248
HOW MANY OF THOSE
BEFORE-AND-AFTER PICTURES

20:15.282 --> 20:16.916
IN THE DIET ADS
DOES THE BIKINI MODEL

20:16.949 --> 20:19.018
EVEN LOOK LIKE THE LADY
IN THE MUUMUU?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.453
I'M NOT CONVINCED
IT ALWAYS IS.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.588
BUT CHECK THIS OUT.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.424
WHEN I OVERLAY THE PHOTOS,

20:24.457 --> 20:26.593
THE FOREHEAD IS LARGER.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.862
IN ONE,
THE JAW LINE'S SQUARE.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.031
IN THE OTHER ONE,
IT'S OVAL.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.566
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW A MOTHER WOULDN'T KNOW

20:33.600 --> 20:34.834
HER OWN CHILD.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.603
YEAH, BUT MRS. HALLANDER
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THIS GIRL

20:36.636 --> 20:37.837
UNTIL SISTER ERICA

20:37.870 --> 20:39.939
SAW THAT TATTOO
ON HER WRIST.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.375
MUNCH, ZOOM IN ON THE INK.
PUT 'EM UP SIDE BY SIDE.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.616
LOOKS THE SAME TO ME.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.551
EXCEPT THEY'RE MIRROR IMAGES.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.453
ON THIS ONE,
THE STEM CURVED TO THE RIGHT.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.589
ON THIS ONE,
IT CURVES TO THE LEFT.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.491
GIRL'S A CON ARTIST.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.428
THEN WHY WOULD SHE TRY
TO KILL HERSELF?

21:01.461 --> 21:03.396
MAYBE SHE KNEW
THE GAME WAS UP.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.331
WHO'S GONNA BREAK IT
TO THE HALLANDERS

21:04.364 --> 21:06.333
THAT THEIR REAL DAUGHTER'S
STILL MISSING?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.967
LET ME TALK
TO HEATHER FIRST.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.002
LIV, SHE'S NOT HEATHER.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.977
(Heather)
HI, OLIVIA.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.846
MY DAD THINKS
I SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE

21:19.879 --> 21:21.681
SO HE DROPPED OFF
THESE STUDY GUIDES

21:21.714 --> 21:22.849
TO GET ME STARTED.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.451
THAT'S NICE.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.755
IS THAT MY CLARINET?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.022
IT IS.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.691
I THOUGHT, UH--

21:31.724 --> 21:32.992
THOUGHT YOU COULD PLAY
SOMETHING FOR ME.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.628
I DON'T THINK
I'D REMEMBER HOW.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.929
YOU WERE FIRST CHAIR.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.665
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
PUTTING IT TOGETHER

21:38.698 --> 21:40.633
AND SEE WHAT COMES BACK?

21:42.702 --> 21:45.638
I--I DON'T REALLY FEEL
LIKE IT RIGHT NOW.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.344
MUSTA GOTTEN THAT TATTOO
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.979
WHAT'S THE STORY?

21:53.012 --> 21:55.415
THERE'S NO STORY.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.616
I JUST GOT IT.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.018
WHERE?

22:01.621 --> 22:04.524
TATTOO PARLOR.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.660
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.996
THE BOY NIKKI WAS DATING

22:10.029 --> 22:13.533
BOUGHT A KIT ON EBAY.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.769
THEY CONVINCED HEATHER
TO LET HIM GIVE HER A TATTOO.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.605
THE HALLANDERS
WERE FURIOUS.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.640
NIKKI NEVER SAW
THE BOY AGAIN.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.041
HEATHER WAS GROUNDED
FOR A MONTH.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.444
I'M HEATHER.
I'M HEATHER.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.746
WHEN HEATHER
WENT MISSING,

22:26.779 --> 22:29.549
THE LAB TOOK DNA
FROM HER TOOTHBRUSH.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.652
WE'RE GONNA RUN THE DNA
FROM YOUR RAPE KIT.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.021
IN A FEW DAYS
WHEN THE RESULTS COME BACK,

22:35.054 --> 22:38.691
WE'RE GONNA
COMPARE THE TWO.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.630
I'M SO SORRY.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.731
WHO ARE YOU?

22:44.764 --> 22:45.832
NOBODY.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.634
WAS ANY PART
OF YOUR STORY TRUE?

22:47.667 --> 22:48.868
THE BASEMENT?
THE RAPE?

22:48.901 --> 22:51.103
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST FORGET IT?

22:51.137 --> 22:53.640
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
TELL ME.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.476
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
THE REAL HEATHER?

22:56.509 --> 22:57.644
NO, NO, I DON'T.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.679
I JUST SAW HER
ON THE INTERNET,

22:59.712 --> 23:00.813
AND WE HAD
THE SAME HAIR.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.449
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.451
BECAUSE--
BECAUSE I NEEDED A FAMILY

23:04.484 --> 23:05.618
AND THEY NEEDED A DAUGHTER.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.454
IT DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.689
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO THESE PEOPLE?

23:15.662 --> 23:17.096
THAT RANCID BITCH.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.665
I KNEW IT.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.666
YOU KNEW
IT WASN'T HEATHER?

23:19.699 --> 23:21.100
NOT FOR SURE.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.902
BUT I KNEW
SHE CAME BACK WRONG.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.671
THERE WAS
A CONNECTION MISSING.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.805
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY FAULT.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.206
I THOUGHT I WAS
A BAD MOTHER.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.608
(Erica)
WHO IS SHE REALLY?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.610
WHAT'S HER NAME?

23:30.643 --> 23:31.944
WE DON'T KNOW,
AND SHE'S NOT TALKING.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.713
HER PRINTS AREN'T
IN THE SYSTEM.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.582
SHE DIDN'T ACT
LIKE HEATHER AT ALL.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.883
BUT WE JUST ASSUMED
IT WAS BECAUSE

23:36.916 --> 23:38.785
OF WHAT SHE'D BEEN THROUGH.

23:38.818 --> 23:39.852
SHE KNEW SO MANY DETAILS.

23:39.886 --> 23:40.820
WELL, SOME SHE GOT
FROM THE INTERNET.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.089
OTHERS FROM HEATHER'S ROOM
AFTER SHE GOT HERE.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.791
YOU KNOW, FROM SCRAPBOOKS,

23:44.824 --> 23:45.825
ALBUMS.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.660
AND OUR HEATHER,

23:47.694 --> 23:50.029
WHERE IS SHE?

23:50.062 --> 23:52.732
I'M SORRY,
THERE'S NO NEW INFORMATION.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.701
THAT PIECE OF GARBAGE
KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.603
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.737
SHE KNEW WAY TOO MUCH.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.572
SHE MUST HAVE MET HEATHER.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.674
WE DON'T THINK SO.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.910
SO WHO'S PAYING FOR THE COMFY
HOSPITAL ROOM SHE'S SITTING IN?

24:03.943 --> 24:06.713
NOT OUR INSURANCE.
SHE ISN'T EVEN A RELATIVE.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.648
THERE HAS TO BE A LAW AGAINST
WHAT SHE'S DONE, RIGHT?

24:08.681 --> 24:11.183
THERE IS, BUT WE BELIEVE
SHE'S AN EDP.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.752
WHAT'S THAT?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.186
AN EMOTIONALLY
DISTURBED PERSON.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.922
I DON'T CARE IF SHE'S
THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.726
WE WANT HER ARRESTED NOW.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.063
(bailiff)
DOCKET ENDING 26041,

24:24.096 --> 24:26.533
THE PEOPLE V. JANE DOE.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.934
ONE COUNT
IDENTITY THEFT.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.235
ONE COUNT FRAUD.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.670
HOW DOES YOUR CLIENT PLEAD?

24:30.703 --> 24:32.505
NOT GUILTY,
YOUR HONOR.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.206
PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.142
(Judge Andrews)
COUNSELOR, CONTROL YOUR CLIENT.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.844
AS TO THE MATTER OF BAIL?

24:37.877 --> 24:39.546
PEOPLE REQUEST 20,000.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.514
WHY NOT A BILLION?
MY CLIENT INDIGENT, YOUR HONOR.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.750
SHE HAS NO FAMILY,
NO FRIENDS.

24:43.783 --> 24:44.751
NO NAME.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.818
PERHAPS IF THE DEFENDANT
PROVIDED US WITH ONE,

24:45.852 --> 24:48.688
THE PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER HER
LESS OF A FLIGHT RISK.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.557
YOUNG LADY,

24:50.590 --> 24:52.058
THIS NICE PROSECUTOR
IS OPENING A DOOR FOR YOU.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.726
WOULD YOU CARE
TO TELL THE COURT

24:53.760 --> 24:55.061
YOUR NAME?

25:03.570 --> 25:06.606
YOU REALIZE THAT DOES
MAKE IT HARDER TO TRUST YOU.

25:06.639 --> 25:07.774
YOUR HONOR,
MY CLIENT IS CURRENTLY UNDER

25:07.807 --> 25:09.108
A 72-HOUR PSYCH HOLD.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.309
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.578
THEN LET'S MAKE SURE
SHE DOESN'T.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.012
BAIL IS SET AT 20,000.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.681
THE DEFENDANT
IS ORDERED TO COMPLETE

25:14.714 --> 25:16.783
HER PSYCHIATRIC
EVALUATION

25:16.816 --> 25:18.250
AT THE BELLEVUE
PRISON WARD

25:18.284 --> 25:20.219
AND THEN BE TRANSFERRED
TO THE TOMBS FOR PROCESSING.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.721
THE TOMBS?

25:21.754 --> 25:23.222
COURT OFFICER,
ESCORT THE DEFENDANT.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.624
(Heather)
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.025
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
MONEY FOR BAIL?

25:26.058 --> 25:27.026
NEXT CASE.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.394
WAIT, SHE KNOWS WHERE
MY SISTER HEATHER IS.

25:28.427 --> 25:31.598
YOU HAVE TO MAKE HER TELL US.
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO THE PROSECUTOR.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.833
PLEASE, JUST PUT HER UNDER OATH
RIGHT NOW AND MAKE HER TELL.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.901
ERICA, SHE DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.769
IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF
IN MY COURTROOM,

25:36.803 --> 25:38.337
I'LL HAVE YOU REMOVED.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.740
PLEASE, DON'T LET HER LEAVE
THIS ROOM WITHOUT TELLING US.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.808
ERICA, WE'LL TALK
AFTER COURT.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.309
NO, ASK HER!

25:43.342 --> 25:45.111
COURT OFFICERS,
REMOVE THIS WOMAN.
WAIT, WAIT.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.946
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US?
WE TOOK YOU INTO OUR HOME.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.214
WE TRUSTED YOU.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.849
WHERE IS HEATHER?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.819
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HER?
YOU HAVE TO TELL US.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.659
I KNOW SHE KNOWS.

25:59.692 --> 26:00.960
SHOW HER WHAT YOU FOUND.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.695
OKAY.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.864
THIS GIRL NEEDED TO ASSUME
A NEW IDENTITY.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.799
FIRST, SHE LOGS ON
TO THE AMERICAN CENTER

26:06.833 --> 26:09.001
FOR LOST AND EXPLOITED
CHILDREN WEBSITE.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.003
SHE ENTERS "FEMALE,"
"NEW YORK,"

26:11.037 --> 26:13.305
AND "MISSING WITHIN
FOUR YEARS."

26:15.708 --> 26:17.810
THERE'S SO MANY.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.178
SHE CURSORS DOWN
UNTIL SHE FINDS ONE

26:19.211 --> 26:21.981
SHE CAN FEASIBLY
PASS HERSELF OFF AS.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.215
HEATHER.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.817
SHE GOOGLES HER

26:24.851 --> 26:27.954
AND FINDS YOUR WEBSITE.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.922
YOU'VE BEEN BLOGGING
ABOUT HER FOR YEARS.

26:29.956 --> 26:33.359
FRIENDS HAVE LOGGED ON
AND SHARED STORIES ABOUT HER.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.994
SHE PRINTS A CLOSE-UP
OF HER TATTOO

26:35.027 --> 26:37.163
AND GETS THE SAME ONE.

26:37.196 --> 26:40.199
SHE GOT ALL THE INFORMATION
SHE NEEDED FROM ME,

26:40.232 --> 26:43.269
NOT HEATHER.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.905
(Benson)
WAIT, CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.406
PERFECT.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.341
I'D LIKE YOU TO FAX ME OVER
THE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.343
ERICA, I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT WE'RE TAKING OVER

26:51.377 --> 26:52.879
YOUR SISTER'S CASE

26:52.912 --> 26:56.649
AND WE'LL BE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIND HER.

26:56.683 --> 26:57.817
THANK YOU.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.752
EL.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.021
WE CALLED EVERY TATTOO PARLOR
IN THE CITY.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.156
SHE GOT A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER
AT TITO'S TATS.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.391
OKAY, BUT WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

27:05.424 --> 27:08.027
SHE ALREADY ADMITTED
THAT SHE MADE EVERYTHING UP.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.829
I KNOW THIS GIRL
WAS ABUSED.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.931
THE MAN WITH HER
PAID WITH A CREDIT CARD.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.432
HIS NAME IS CARL VASKO.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.134
HE MATCHES
THE PRIEST'S DESCRIPTION

27:15.167 --> 27:17.003
OF THE MAN THAT
WAS WITH HER AT CHURCH.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.905
SO IF HE'S HER ABUSER,
WHY WOULD HE BUY HER A TATTOO

27:18.938 --> 27:20.406
SO SHE COULD POSE
AS SOMEONE ELSE?

27:20.439 --> 27:23.743
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S GO ASK HIM.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.646
[loud knocking]

27:29.215 --> 27:31.350
WHATEVER YOU'RE SELLING,
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.252
WE'RE NOT SELLING.
WE'RE COLLECTING...YOU.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.722
CARL VASKO, WE HAVE
A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.289
ARREST?
WHAT THE HELL FOR?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.925
OH, LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.192
REMEMBER HER?

27:43.095 --> 27:45.131
GOT A RUNNER!

27:45.164 --> 27:47.433
(Stabler)
RUNNER!

27:52.104 --> 27:54.340
VASKO, STOP!

27:58.277 --> 27:59.746
WE GOT A DROPPER.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.314
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.716
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.452
[glass breaks]

28:06.485 --> 28:08.220
LIV?!

28:11.791 --> 28:14.493
LIV?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.028
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:16.062 --> 28:17.897
I THOUGHT I SAW VASKO
GO THIS WAY.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.365
WELL, HE TRIED
TO EVADE ARREST.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.833
AND ANYTHING WE FIND DURING
THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME

28:20.867 --> 28:22.969
IS FAIR GAME.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.437
THAT'S THE STEEL DOOR
SHE DESCRIBED.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.793
WALLS HAVE GOT TO BE
18 INCHES THICK.

28:50.396 --> 28:54.166
SHE COULDA BEEN TRAPPED
DOWN HERE HER WHOLE LIFE.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.936
NO ONE WOULD HAVE EVER
HEARD HER SCREAM.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.845
(Cragen)
WHAT, ARE YOU WAITING
FOR AN INVITATION?

29:05.878 --> 29:07.413
JUST THOUGHT WE'D GIVE VASKO
A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.281
I THINK HE'S FAMILIAR
WITH THE TACTICS

29:09.315 --> 29:10.783
OF BREAKING SOMEONE.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.418
ALL YOU'RE GIVING HIM
IS TIME TO LAWYER UP.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.186
WE'RE BUYING
OURSELVES SOME.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.554
(Stabler)
YOU GOT SOMETHING?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.556
IT'S TOO SOON
FOR DNA RESULTS.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.259
SO I RAN AN INDIVIDUAL
SPECIFIC AUTO-ANTIBODIES TEST

29:20.292 --> 29:21.928
ON MR. VASKO.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.529
IT'S NOT ADMISSIBLE
IN COURT YET,

29:23.562 --> 29:25.431
BUT IT ONLY TAKES
TWO HOURS.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.099
WELL, HOW DID WE GET
A COURT ORDER

29:27.133 --> 29:28.300
FOR HIS DNA ALREADY?

29:28.334 --> 29:29.468
WE DIDN'T NEED ONE.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.270
VASKO RAN,
FIN CLOTHESLINED HIM,

29:31.303 --> 29:33.305
BLOODIED UP HIS NOSE
ON FIN'S SLEEVE.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.107
AND FIN WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO PASS IT ALONG TO ME.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.543
HE'S A MATCH FOR THE SEMEN
ON YOUR GIRL'S DRESS.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.945
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.579
HOLD ON.
I'M NOT FINISHED.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.248
I DID GET THE DNA RESULTS

29:42.281 --> 29:43.950
FROM YOUR JANE DOE'S
RAPE KIT.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.151
SHE'S NOT HEATHER.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.553
WE FIGURED THAT ONE OUT
OURSELVES.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.421
DID YOU KNOW HER NAME
IS KRISTEN VUCELIK?

29:49.455 --> 29:51.891
WHAT, SHE'S IN THE SYSTEM?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.860
NO, IN CODIS.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.361
SHE WAS ABDUCTED IN OHIO
SIX YEARS AGO.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.829
HER MOTHER MARCIE

29:56.863 --> 29:59.231
WAS CERTAIN IT WAS
A PARENTAL KIDNAPPING

29:59.265 --> 30:02.068
BY HER EX-HUSBAND,
CARL VUCELIK.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.336
AKA CARL VASKO.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.571
HE CHANGED HIS LAST NAME.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.840
AND THEN HELD HIS OWN DAUGHTER
IN A DUNGEON

30:07.874 --> 30:11.610
TO RAPE HER
FOR SIX LONG YEARS.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.545
I'M A GOOD MAN.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.915
I MEAN, I PAY MY TAXES.
I GO TO CHURCH.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.249
I DO VOLUNTEER WORK.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.550
I MEAN, I'M A PILLAR
OF THE COMMUNITY.

30:18.584 --> 30:19.886
JUST ASK ANYONE.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.088
HOW 'BOUT
YOUR EX-WIFE MARCIE?

30:25.424 --> 30:28.895
MARCIE'S A SHRIEKING,
MAN-HATING, BALL-BUSTING BITCH.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.629
I KNOW THAT TYPE.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.298
THEN WHY DID THE COURT
AWARD HER SOLE CUSTODY

30:32.331 --> 30:34.166
OF KRISTEN
AFTER THE DIVORCE?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.534
BECAUSE SHE FILLED
THAT SWEET LITTLE GIRL'S HEAD

30:35.567 --> 30:37.569
WITH LIES ABOUT ME.

30:37.603 --> 30:38.905
YEAH, AND I'M SURE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY BASELESS.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.339
LOOK, ARE YOU GONNA
LET HIM TALK

30:40.372 --> 30:42.208
OR ARE YOU GONNA KEEP UP
WITH THE SMART-ASS REMARKS?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.209
SCREW YOU.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.410
LET THE MAN TELL HIS STORY.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.616
LOOK, SHE WAS RAISING KRISTEN
TO BE A SHREW JUST LIKE HER.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.384
I COULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.886
YOU KNEW KRISTEN WOULD BE
BETTER OFF WITH YOU?

30:53.920 --> 30:54.954
EXACTLY.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.588
I SAW THE LOVELY LITTLE
RUMPUS ROOM THAT YOU MADE

30:56.622 --> 30:57.656
FOR HER IN YOUR BASEMENT.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.525
I COULDN'T LET HER WHORE
OF A MOTHER TAKE HER BACK.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.427
I HAD TO HIDE HER.
YEAH, FOR SIX YEARS.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.462
HOW LONG TILL YOU STARTED
RAPING HER?

31:06.432 --> 31:09.168
KRISTEN'S A GOOD GIRL NOW.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.503
SHE WOULD NEVER SAY
A WORD AGAINST ME.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.606
YOU REALLY THINK YOU HAVE
COMPLETE CONTROL, DON'T YOU?

31:14.640 --> 31:18.144
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY
AFTER SHE ESCAPED.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.946
THERE WAS NOTHING
TO ESCAPE FROM.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.348
KRISTEN WAS FREE TO LEAVE
AT ANY TIME, BUT SHE DIDN'T.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.582
WELL, HE IS RIGHT.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.951
I MEAN, THE LAST MONTH

31:24.984 --> 31:26.085
SHE DID HAVE FULL ACCESS

31:26.118 --> 31:27.619
TO THE HOUSE
AND THE COMPUTER.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.957
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.491
THERE'S ALWAYS
THAT LITTLE PIECE

31:32.524 --> 31:34.093
OF THEIR MOTHER
THAT'S LEFT IN THEM.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.228
HOW DID SHE
MANIPULATE YOU

31:36.262 --> 31:38.230
INTO GETTING HER
THAT TATTOO?

31:38.264 --> 31:40.666
IT WAS MY IDEA.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.501
SHE SHOWED ME A PICTURE.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.635
I WANTED HER TO HAVE IT
FOR GOOD LUCK.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.037
WELL, IT WORKED.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.006
SHE NEEDED IT
TO PASS HERSELF OFF

31:47.039 --> 31:48.941
AS ANOTHER PERSON.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.609
SHE RAN AWAY
TO ANOTHER FAMILY.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.245
COMPLETE STRANGERS
ARE BETTER THAN YOU,

31:53.279 --> 31:55.447
YOU DISGUSTING PIECE
OF FILTH.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.451
WHERE'S KRISTEN?

31:59.485 --> 32:00.686
I'D LIKE TO SEE HER.

32:00.719 --> 32:01.553
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU

32:01.587 --> 32:04.556
CASTRATED
WITH A RUSTY STEAK KNIFE.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.959
NEITHER ARE GONNA HAPPEN,
BUT WE CAN BOTH DREAM.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.694
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
I THINK YOU NEED A SICK DAY.

32:08.727 --> 32:09.828
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
ON THE RAG.

32:09.861 --> 32:12.364
TOUCH ME AGAIN, AND I WILL
SUE YOU FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.235
THAT WAS A LITTLE
TOO CONVINCING.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.337
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.638
ELLIOTT'S GONNA SUCKER
A FULL CONFESSION

32:19.671 --> 32:20.672
OUT OF THAT IDIOT.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.174
WHILE YOU DO WHAT?

32:22.208 --> 32:24.176
KRISTEN'S
72-HOUR PSYCH HOLD IS UP.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.677
I GOTTA GET THE HALLANDERS
TO DROP THE CHARGES

32:25.711 --> 32:27.346
BEFORE SHE'S TRANSFERRED
TO THE TOMBS.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.981
LIV, I CHECKED.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.649
KRISTEN'S ALREADY
ON HER WAY THERE.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.718
WELL, I GOTTA GET HER OUT.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.420
MUNCH AND FIN WENT TO TALK
TO THE HALLANDERS.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.288
WHERE'S GREYLEK?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.657
SHE'S TRACKING DOWN JUDGE
ANDREWS AT A BLACK TIE EVENT.

32:38.690 --> 32:39.658
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT BASEMENT.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.961
I CANNOT LET THIS GIRL
SIT IN A CELL ALL NIGHT.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.201
(Benson)
IT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS,

32:49.235 --> 32:52.138
BUT I'M GONNA
GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

32:52.171 --> 32:55.474
I ALWAYS KNEW
I'D DIE IN A CELL.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.477
KRISTEN, I KNOW IT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE IT,

32:58.510 --> 33:01.413
BUT THIS NIGHTMARE
IS OVER.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.682
YOUR FATHER'S GOING TO PRISON,
NOT YOU.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.185
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.287
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S GOOD
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.322
OH, KRISTEN,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.527
IS THAT WHY
YOU CUT YOUR WRISTS?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.233
[sniffles]

33:21.267 --> 33:23.035
ALL THOSE YEARS
IN THE BASEMENT,

33:23.069 --> 33:24.670
ALL I DREAMED ABOUT
WAS GETTING OUT

33:24.703 --> 33:28.307
AND BEING PART
OF A REAL FAMILY,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.109
HOW PERFECT
LIFE WOULD BE.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.081
IT'S NEVER PERFECT.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.818
BUT IT WILL GET BETTER.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.054
NIKKI KEPT HINTING
THAT SHE KNEW

33:42.088 --> 33:43.589
THAT I WASN'T
THE REAL HEATHER,

33:43.622 --> 33:45.124
AND I WAS AFRAID
THAT IF THEY FOUND OUT

33:45.157 --> 33:46.558
THEY'D KILL ME.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.328
I'D ESCAPE A RAPIST
JUST TO BE MURDERED?

33:49.361 --> 33:53.332
BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
YOU DID ESCAPE.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.800
HOW?

33:57.436 --> 33:59.505
I GAINED HIS TRUST.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.146
HE STARTED LETTING ME OUT
INTO THE HOUSE LAST SUMMER,

34:07.179 --> 34:08.647
AND WHEN
I DIDN'T TRY AND RUN

34:08.680 --> 34:10.782
HE STARTED GIVING ME
MORE FREEDOM.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.518
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
ESCAPE THEN?

34:12.551 --> 34:13.785
BECAUSE HE SAID

34:13.819 --> 34:17.423
THAT IF I TRIED ANYTHING
HE'D KILL ME.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.825
IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO WORK UP THE COURAGE,

34:19.858 --> 34:23.862
AND I FINALLY DID.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.497
WHY DIDN'T YOU TURN HIM IN?

34:25.531 --> 34:27.133
'CAUSE THE HALLANDERS

34:27.166 --> 34:30.702
ALREADY THOUGHT
THAT I WAS THEIR DAUGHTER.

34:30.736 --> 34:34.240
IF I TOLD, EVERYONE WOULD KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T BELONG.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.578
PLUS...

34:39.611 --> 34:42.148
HE'S MY FATHER.

34:49.788 --> 34:53.091
KRISTEN, WHY DIDN'T YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR MOTHER IN OHIO?

34:55.194 --> 34:58.130
MY MOM DIED THREE YEARS AGO.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.602
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

35:03.635 --> 35:07.406
HE SHOWED ME THE ANNOUNCEMENT
IN THE PAPER.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.578
KRISTEN, THAT WAS FAKE.

35:15.181 --> 35:18.817
YOUR MOTHER'S ALIVE.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.820
AND SHE HASN'T STOPPED LOOKING
FOR YOU ALL THESE YEARS.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.559
[buzzer sounds]

35:48.914 --> 35:51.583
KRISTEN?

35:51.617 --> 35:53.685
KRISTEN.
MOM.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.721
[both sobbing]

36:05.931 --> 36:07.933
GOOD NEWS, THE SLAVE MASTER'S
NOW THE PRISONER.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.302
CARL VUCELIK WAS DENIED BAIL
AT ARRAIGNMENT.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.371
HE'S SITTING IN
A COZY LITTLE CELL IN RIKERS.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.805
I HEAR YOU TWO BONDED.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.275
OH, YEAH,
WE'RE GONNA STAY PEN PALS.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.976
KRISTEN AND HER MOM ARE GOING
BACK TO OHIO TODAY.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.478
I'M GONNA LET THEM KNOW
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

36:19.511 --> 36:20.812
ABOUT CARL ANYMORE.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.283
MARCIE,
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON CALLING.

36:24.316 --> 36:27.919
WHEN IS SHE DUE BACK?

36:27.953 --> 36:31.323
UH, I WILL CHECK
RIGHT NOW.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.824
SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO KRISTEN?

36:32.858 --> 36:34.560
SHE TOLD HER MOTHER
THAT SHE NEEDED

36:34.593 --> 36:35.994
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
BEFORE SHE LEFT.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.831
HALLANDERS ARE THE ONLY
PEOPLE SHE KNOWS.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.867
HER FLIGHT LEAVES IN AN HOUR.
SHE NEVER CAME BACK.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.371
NO, SHE DIDN'T COME HERE.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.772
WELL, HAS KRISTEN TRIED
TO CONTACT YOU AT ALL.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.308
NO.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.877
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE THAT DAY IN COURT.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.645
ANTHONY, GO IN THE OTHER ROOM
AND WATCH TV.

36:53.679 --> 36:54.946
OKAY, MOMMY.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.283
MOM, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:57.316 --> 36:58.684
WE WERE ACROSS THE STREET
IN THE PARK.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.287
I SAW KRISTEN
LEAVE HERE WITH NIKKI.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.021
NO, NIKKI
WAS IN HER ROOM.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.956
SHE COULDN'T HAVE HEARD
ANYTHING THAT KRISTEN

37:04.990 --> 37:06.958
SAID TO US.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.361
YOU SAID THAT SHE HADN'T
BEEN HERE.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.463
WHY ARE YOU LYING TO US?

37:14.300 --> 37:15.534
(Stabler)
MRS. HALLANDER.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.570
WHAT DID KRISTEN
TELL YOU ABOUT NIKKI?

37:18.604 --> 37:19.971
(Erica)
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MOM,

37:20.005 --> 37:22.341
YOU'VE MADE EXCUSES FOR NIKKI
HER ENTIRE LIFE.

37:22.374 --> 37:23.742
WHAT HAS SHE DONE NOW?

37:27.313 --> 37:29.348
KIRSTEN CAME HERE...

37:31.383 --> 37:33.051
TO TELL ME THAT NIKKI

37:33.084 --> 37:35.821
HAD SAID SOME BAD THINGS
TO HER.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.022
WHAT?
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.794
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.530
SHE--

37:44.563 --> 37:46.832
NIKKI SAID THAT

37:46.865 --> 37:50.302
SHE KNEW...

37:50.336 --> 37:52.003
THAT SHE WASN'T HER SISTER.

37:55.341 --> 37:56.775
AND THAT SHE HAD BETTER LEAVE

37:56.808 --> 38:00.846
BEFORE THE SAME THINGS
HAPPENED TO HER

38:00.879 --> 38:04.082
THAT HAPPENED
TO THE REAL HEATHER.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.452
[gasps]

38:06.485 --> 38:08.987
OH, MY GOD.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.056
NIKKI KILLED HEATHER?

38:11.089 --> 38:14.025
OH, ERICA.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.462
I AM SO SORRY.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.729
YOU KNEW?

38:17.763 --> 38:19.331
YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.667
NO, NO, NOT UNTIL
MUCH LATER.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.435
BUT, SWEETHEART,

38:23.469 --> 38:26.872
WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?
OH, MY GOD.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.907
HEATHER WAS GONE.

38:28.940 --> 38:32.778
I COULDN'T LOSE
TWO DAUGHTERS.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.514
IF SHE DOES ONE THING
TO HARM KRISTEN,

38:35.547 --> 38:36.682
YOU'RE GOING AWAY

38:36.715 --> 38:39.385
AS AN ACCESSORY
TO THAT MURDER TOO.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.519
WHERE DID SHE TAKE HER?

38:40.552 --> 38:43.389
I DON'T KNOW.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.424
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE NIKKI KILLED HEATHER?

38:51.630 --> 38:52.931
(Kristen)
PLEASE, DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.800
I BELIEVE YOU.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.602
NO, YOU HAVE TO CLIMB
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP

38:56.635 --> 38:59.438
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE REAL HEATHER.

38:59.471 --> 39:00.606
(Benson)
KRISTEN!

39:00.639 --> 39:01.607
DON'T DO IT, KRISTEN.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.409
(Nikki)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:03.442 --> 39:04.342
KRISTEN, COME DOWN
OFF THE LADDER.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.412
I WAS JUST SHOWING HER THE VIEW.
TELL THEM.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.380
NO, SHE TOLD ME
THAT I HAD TO COME.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.615
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.916
SHE'S LYING.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.751
NIKKI, LET HER GO.
DON'T MAKE THIS ANY WORSE.

39:12.784 --> 39:13.619
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.454
SHE CAME HERE
OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

39:15.487 --> 39:16.922
JUST LIKE HEATHER DID?
STAY BACK.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.424
YOU MADE HEATHER
CLIMB THAT LADDER.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.658
YOU PUSHED HER
INTO THE STACK.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.760
NO, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.029
STOP IT.
WE KNOW THE TRUTH.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.866
SHE CAUGHT ME DOING DRUGS.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.135
SHE WAS GONNA TELL
MOM AND DAD.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.369
KRISTEN, COME DOWN.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.777
NIKKI, I NEED YOU
TO COME DOWN FROM THERE.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.113
LISTEN TO ME,

39:42.147 --> 39:44.049
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOURSELF.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.084
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS DOING IT.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.686
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.154
NO, NIKKI, DON'T.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.155
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

39:50.188 --> 39:53.825
YOU'VE ALWAYS HATED ME.
THE WHOLE FAMILY HAS.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.894
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.796
NIKKI, PLEASE.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.434
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU TOO.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.706
COME ON DOWN.

40:32.097 --> 40:36.602
THE POLICE GAVE UP LOOKING
FOR HEATHER A LONG TIME AGO.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.940
WHY DID YOU PICK US?

40:43.975 --> 40:46.945
