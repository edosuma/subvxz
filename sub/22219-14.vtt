<b> <i>male announcer: This season</i> </b>
<b> <i>on "Ink Master,"</i> </b>

00:03.537 --> 00:05.839
<b> <i>it's Peck versus NuÃ±ez.</i> </b>

00:05.839 --> 00:07.307
<b> <i>On the last episode...</i> </b>

00:07.307 --> 00:09.743
<b>- We just have to send</b>
<b>one of those boys home</b>

00:09.743 --> 00:12.379
<b>and we guarantee that there's</b>
<b>a woman in the finale.</b>

00:12.379 --> 00:14.948
<b> <i>announcer: Teams were even</i> </b>
<b> <i>as the artists battled</i> </b>

00:14.948 --> 00:18.285
<b> <i>for the advantage</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the flash challenge.</i> </b>

00:18.285 --> 00:20.153
<b>- The hell are we gonna do,</b>
<b>dude?</b>

00:20.153 --> 00:22.756
<b>- Uh-oh, what are they doing?</b>

00:22.756 --> 00:24.758
<b>And that's the team</b>
<b>I did not want to win.</b>

00:24.758 --> 00:27.160
<b>- Well, it's good for me</b>
<b>if they win.</b>

00:27.160 --> 00:28.829
<b>- Do we even need</b>
<b>to go deliberate?</b>

00:28.829 --> 00:29.830
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- We have a pretty</b>

00:29.830 --> 00:31.164
<b>clear-cut winner today.</b>

00:31.164 --> 00:33.166
<b>- Now is the time for us</b>
<b>to lead a charge.</b>

00:33.166 --> 00:36.537
<b>- Why try to save anybody?</b>
<b>Everybody's getting [bleep].</b>

00:41.608 --> 00:44.111
<b> <i>to fire on the females.</i> </b>

00:44.111 --> 00:45.879
<b>- Kelly.</b>

00:45.879 --> 00:46.880
<b>- Nikki.</b>

00:49.516 --> 00:52.519
<b> <i>- Kevin and Nate want to see me</i> </b>
<b> <i>and Nikki go head-to-head</i> </b>

00:52.519 --> 00:55.789
<b>because this might be</b>
<b>their only opportunity</b>

00:55.789 --> 00:57.624
<b> <i>to get one over on the girls.</i> </b>

00:57.624 --> 00:59.226
<b>- My vote is for Nikki.</b>

00:59.226 --> 01:00.961
<b>- Oh, Jesus Christ, really?</b>

01:00.961 --> 01:02.596
<b>- You can't be mad</b>
<b>at this [bleep].</b>

01:02.596 --> 01:07.067
<b>- I can roll my [bleep] eyes if</b>
<b>I want to roll my [bleep] eyes.</b>

01:07.067 --> 01:10.938
<b> <i>announcer: In the elimination,</i> </b>
<b> <i>Ryan, Nikki, and Kevin</i> </b>

01:10.938 --> 01:12.239
<b> <i>were the bottom three.</i> </b>

01:12.239 --> 01:13.340
<b>- Ryan...</b>

01:13.340 --> 01:14.608
<b> <i>- The darkness</i> </b>
<b> <i>under the eyes--</i> </b>

01:14.608 --> 01:16.143
<b> <i>it got</i> </b>
<b> <i>a little bit too dark,</i> </b>

01:16.143 --> 01:18.879
<b>and you dramatized the little</b>
<b>peak in his lip too much.</b>

01:18.879 --> 01:21.381
<b>- On accuracy day, those are</b>
<b>the things to point out.</b>

01:21.381 --> 01:22.749
<b>- Nikki...</b>

01:22.749 --> 01:24.451
<b> <i>- You put that highlight</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the top of the lip.</i> </b>

01:24.451 --> 01:26.220
<b>It gives it a lipstick feel.</b>
<b>- This looks like</b>

01:26.220 --> 01:27.554
<b>Little Miss Teen Toddler.</b>

01:27.554 --> 01:28.922
<b>- Kevin...</b>

01:28.922 --> 01:31.091
<b>- What I'm missing in your face</b>
<b>is your liner.</b>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.560
<b>I've been in your ear</b>
<b>from day one, but I can't</b>

01:33.560 --> 01:34.962
<b>get you to change your ways.</b>

01:34.962 --> 01:37.497
<b>- Anyone with eyes, I feel like,</b>
<b>would say that mine</b>

01:37.497 --> 01:40.100
<b>looks more like the picture</b>
<b>than Nikki's does.</b>

01:40.100 --> 01:42.669
<b>- I wanted to do it as accurate</b>
<b>to that photo as possible.</b>

01:42.669 --> 01:44.371
<b>- Yeah, whatever--</b>
<b>- Yours isn't gonna look</b>

01:44.371 --> 01:46.473
<b>like your child.</b>
<b>- It's still gonna look like</b>

01:46.473 --> 01:48.175
<b>a good tattoo</b>
<b>on a 40-year-old man.</b>

01:48.175 --> 01:49.643
<b>- You know your tat--</b>
<b>Okay, really?</b>

01:49.643 --> 01:51.311
<b>- Whatever, whatever.</b>
<b>- Calm down, right?</b>

01:51.311 --> 01:52.846
<b>- No, you calm down.</b>
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

01:52.846 --> 01:56.383
<b>- The judges have decided,</b>
<b>Kevin, you do not have</b>

01:56.383 --> 01:58.452
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

<b>- I knew there was</b>
<b>a possibility that Kevin</b>

03:08.555 --> 03:11.225
<b>was gonna crap the bed, man,</b>
<b>and he did,</b>

03:11.225 --> 03:13.060
<b>and I'm pissed about it.</b>

03:13.060 --> 03:15.062
<b>- Nikki should have gone home--</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

03:15.062 --> 03:16.230
<b>- But...</b>
<b>- But now we're</b>

03:16.230 --> 03:17.764
<b>down to just two.</b>
<b>- Yep.</b>

03:17.764 --> 03:21.602
<b>- I'm worried about those girls,</b>
<b>as a three person team,</b>

03:21.602 --> 03:23.470
<b>trying to run stuff around here.</b>

03:23.470 --> 03:25.072
<b>- Well, it's happening,</b>

03:25.072 --> 03:27.074
<b>- You want to be</b>
<b>three girls and one guy?</b>

03:27.074 --> 03:29.376
<b>- Pff, no.</b>
<b>- We can't let it happen.</b>

03:31.111 --> 03:32.880
<b>- This alliance</b>
<b>has been crucial.</b>

03:32.880 --> 03:35.582
<b>There are five people left,</b>
<b>and our alliance</b>

03:35.582 --> 03:37.851
<b>is three out of the five.</b>
<b>- I know.</b>

03:37.851 --> 03:40.787
<b>- Yeah, Nikki and I make up</b>
<b>the entirety of Team NuÃ±ez.</b>

03:40.787 --> 03:42.222
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>- And I don't think</b>

03:42.222 --> 03:45.092
<b>it's ever been more girls</b>
<b>in the house than guys ever.</b>

03:45.092 --> 03:47.828
<b>- Never.</b>
<b>No matter what the outcome is</b>

03:47.828 --> 03:50.664
<b>there will be one woman</b>
<b>in the finale.</b>

03:50.664 --> 03:52.366
<b>- I want to populate</b>
<b>that finale.</b>

03:52.366 --> 03:53.534

<b>Only five of you remain--</b>

04:07.648 --> 04:10.817
<b>Three on Team Peck</b>
<b>and Two on Team NuÃ±ez.</b>

04:10.817 --> 04:14.555
<b>You are all very close</b>
<b>to earning $100,000,</b>

04:14.555 --> 04:18.291
<b>a feature in "Inked" magazine,</b>
<b>and the title of Ink Master.</b>

04:18.291 --> 04:20.560
<b>- Ahh.</b>
<b>- Also on the line</b>

04:20.560 --> 04:23.330
<b>is a guest spot at Chris' shop,</b>
<b>Hand Crafted,</b>

04:23.330 --> 04:26.166
<b>in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,</b>
<b>or Oliver's shop,</b>

04:26.166 --> 04:29.303
<b>Elm Street Tattoo,</b>
<b>in Dallas, Texas.</b>

04:29.303 --> 04:32.673
<b>Today, we have</b>
<b>a very special guest judge.</b>

04:32.673 --> 04:36.243
<b>Tattooing around the world</b>
<b>for the last 28 years,</b>

04:36.243 --> 04:37.978
<b>he's the author</b>
<b>and illustrator</b>

04:37.978 --> 04:41.582
<b>of his own line of art books:</b>
<b>Chris Garver.</b>

04:41.582 --> 04:44.585
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

04:44.585 --> 04:46.920
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

04:46.920 --> 04:49.089
<b> <i>- Chris Garver is definitely</i> </b>
<b> <i>someone I look up to.</i> </b>

04:49.089 --> 04:50.924
<b>He's got a lot of respect</b>
<b>in the industry.</b>

04:50.924 --> 04:52.092
<b>- Thanks for coming.</b>

04:52.092 --> 04:53.827
<b>- I've been tattooing</b>
<b>since 1988.</b>

04:53.827 --> 04:55.829
<b> <i>I'm known for being versatile,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I like to do</i> </b>

04:55.829 --> 04:57.264
<b> <i>large scale work.</i> </b>

04:57.264 --> 04:59.233
<b> <i>There's five people left in</i> </b>
<b> <i>this competition,</i> </b>

04:59.233 --> 05:02.436
<b>and what I'm really hoping</b>
<b>to see is great style</b>

05:02.436 --> 05:03.937
<b>and really good aesthetics.</b>

05:05.506 --> 05:07.040
<b>- As the numbers get smaller,</b>

05:07.040 --> 05:10.244
<b>this competition</b>
<b>is only gonna get more brutal.</b>

05:10.244 --> 05:14.181
<b>And, once again,</b>
<b>there is no flash challenge.</b>

05:14.181 --> 05:18.418
<b>We are moving directly into</b>
<b>the next elimination tattoo.</b>

05:18.418 --> 05:20.921
<b>- This is absolutely insane.</b>

05:20.921 --> 05:24.691
<b> <i>No opportunity for skull picks</i> </b>
<b> <i>this close to the finale</i> </b>

05:24.691 --> 05:26.260
<b>is petrifying.</b>

05:26.260 --> 05:29.396
<b>- Today, we're testing</b>
<b>consistency.</b>

05:29.396 --> 05:32.432
<b>- Without consistency, a tattoo</b>
<b>can get all out of whack.</b>

05:32.432 --> 05:34.668
<b> <i>Things won't match, things</i> </b>
<b> <i>won't be blended the same.</i> </b>

05:34.668 --> 05:36.303
<b>All of your flaws will show.</b>

05:36.303 --> 05:40.073
<b>- For this elimination tattoo,</b>
<b>you must make your canvases</b>

05:40.073 --> 05:43.644
<b>super human,</b>
<b>by transforming them</b>

05:43.644 --> 05:45.879
<b>into cyborgs.</b>
<b>- Ooh.</b>

05:45.879 --> 05:47.447
<b> <i>- Cyborg tattoos?</i> </b>

05:47.447 --> 05:50.117
<b>I've been trying</b>
<b>to avoid these for years.</b>

05:50.117 --> 05:54.121
<b>- A cyborg has mechanical parts</b>
<b>incorporated into their body</b>

05:54.121 --> 05:56.089
<b>to enhance their capabilities.</b>

05:56.089 --> 05:59.726
<b>Your canvases want</b>
<b>gears, pistons, cogs,</b>

05:59.726 --> 06:02.563
<b>pulleys, and other mechanisms</b>
<b>where joints and muscles</b>

06:02.563 --> 06:03.897
<b>would exist.</b>

06:03.897 --> 06:06.300
<b> <i>- Biomechanical tattoos</i> </b>
<b> <i>are always really harsh</i> </b>

06:06.300 --> 06:09.403
<b>and rigid, and I don't even know</b>
<b>where to start</b>

06:09.403 --> 06:11.038
<b>on designs like this.</b>

06:11.038 --> 06:14.308
<b>- And there's no better</b>
<b>test of consistency</b>

06:14.308 --> 06:18.445
<b>than working with other artists</b>
<b>on multiple tattoos.</b>

06:18.445 --> 06:22.916
<b>So, once again, it's Team Peck</b>
<b>versus Team NuÃ±ez.</b>

06:22.916 --> 06:26.220
<b>All the members of your team</b>
<b>must tattoo your canvas</b>

06:26.220 --> 06:28.889
<b>at the same time.</b>

06:28.889 --> 06:30.791
<b>You're being judged as a team.</b>

06:30.791 --> 06:34.928
<b>That means you win as a team</b>
<b>or you lose as a team.</b>

06:34.928 --> 06:37.064
<b>- It's hard as hell</b>
<b>to tattoo with somebody else</b>

06:37.064 --> 06:39.633
<b>tattooing next to you,</b>
<b>much less two other people.</b>

06:39.633 --> 06:41.101
<b>It's gonna be a nightmare.</b>

06:41.101 --> 06:43.904
<b>- But that's not all.</b>
<b>- Why would it be?</b>

06:43.904 --> 06:47.207
<b>- Every hour,</b>
<b>you must switch tattoos,</b>

06:47.207 --> 06:50.878
<b>proving your consistency</b>
<b>by seamlessly picking up</b>

06:50.878 --> 06:53.080
<b>where the last artist left off.</b>

06:53.080 --> 06:55.382
<b>- Aw, man, this is going to be</b>
<b>a [bleep] pain in the ass.</b>

06:55.382 --> 06:57.618
<b> <i>All of us have</i> </b>
<b> <i>very different styles,</i> </b>

06:57.618 --> 07:00.287
<b> <i>and Nate's line work sucks.</i> </b>

07:00.287 --> 07:02.256
<b>If we don't show consistency</b>
<b>in these tattoos,</b>

07:02.256 --> 07:03.724
<b>we're going to lose.</b>

07:03.724 --> 07:07.361
<b>- In a competition this tight,</b>
<b>every part of every tattoo</b>

07:07.361 --> 07:09.162
<b>will be closely examined.</b>

07:09.162 --> 07:12.399
<b>- You guys, this is it.</b>
<b>One of Oliver's team members</b>

07:12.399 --> 07:15.035
<b>is going to the live finale</b>
<b>because we only have two.</b>

07:15.035 --> 07:17.771
<b>There are no two better</b>
<b>tattooers that I could think of</b>

07:17.771 --> 07:19.840
<b>to have work together</b>
<b>to have the same style</b>

07:19.840 --> 07:22.276
<b>and really pull this off.</b>
<b>You two have to make it.</b>

07:22.276 --> 07:25.412
<b>We are not losing.</b>
<b>Knock them off.</b>

07:25.412 --> 07:27.347
<b>- Team work challenge.</b>
<b>Historically through</b>

07:27.347 --> 07:30.484
<b>this competition, Team Peck</b>
<b>has been the stronger team.</b>

07:30.484 --> 07:32.953
<b>Let's keep that up.</b>
<b>Work together, work smart,</b>

07:32.953 --> 07:36.056
<b>use each other's strengths</b>
<b>to help each other's weaknesses.</b>

07:36.056 --> 07:38.058
<b>Consistency is the challenge.</b>

07:38.058 --> 07:40.694
<b>- To determine which team gets</b>
<b>to assign the canvases,</b>

07:40.694 --> 07:43.463
<b>you are now gonna draw skulls.</b>

07:43.463 --> 07:46.266
<b>On the bottom</b>
<b>of one skull is an "X".</b>

07:46.266 --> 07:49.636
<b>Get the "X", and your team</b>
<b>will get to pick your canvas.</b>

07:49.636 --> 07:52.873
<b>Nate, because you won the last</b>
<b>elimination tattoo,</b>

07:52.873 --> 07:56.810
<b>Team Peck will get to</b>
<b>draw for the "X" first.</b>

07:56.810 --> 07:58.212
<b>- Get a good one.</b>

07:58.212 --> 08:01.215
<b> <i>[suspenseful music]</i> </b>

08:01.215 --> 08:04.384
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

08:04.384 --> 08:05.452
<b>- "X".</b>

08:05.452 --> 08:06.553
<b>- Booyah!</b>
<b>[laughter]</b>

08:06.553 --> 08:08.922
<b>- Yeah.</b>

08:08.922 --> 08:10.190
<b>- It's on now.</b>

08:10.190 --> 08:12.059
<b>- We can't catch a break.</b>

08:12.059 --> 08:15.362
<b>- Congratulations, Team Peck.</b>
<b>Your team has the power</b>

08:15.362 --> 08:17.898
<b>to pick your canvas.</b>

08:17.898 --> 08:19.333
<b>Let's meet your canvases.</b>

08:19.333 --> 08:22.336
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

08:22.336 --> 08:24.738
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

08:24.738 --> 08:26.907
<b>Team Peck, pick your canvas.</b>

08:26.907 --> 08:28.642
<b> <i>- It's important that we get</i> </b>
<b> <i>a good canvas</i> </b>

08:28.642 --> 08:31.245
<b> <i>because Team NuÃ±ez</i> </b>
<b> <i>definitely has the advantage.</i> </b>

08:31.245 --> 08:33.780
<b>There's only two of them.</b>
<b>It's much easier for them</b>

08:33.780 --> 08:36.049
<b>to flip flop back and forth</b>
<b>and match styles.</b>

08:36.049 --> 08:37.251
<b>- So what do you want to get?</b>

08:37.251 --> 08:38.652
<b>- I wanna get</b>
<b>biomechanical tattoos</b>

08:38.652 --> 08:40.821
<b>on my thighs and forearms,</b>
<b>even thinking about</b>

08:40.821 --> 08:44.391
<b>incorporating some weapon parts</b>
<b>in there, some gun parts.</b>

08:44.391 --> 08:46.059
<b>- Are you willing to</b>
<b>go for black and gray?</b>

08:46.059 --> 08:48.095
<b>- I'd like color,</b>
<b>but if the detail's there,</b>

08:48.095 --> 08:49.530
<b>black and gray will work.</b>

08:49.530 --> 08:51.398
<b>- Do you have a preference</b>
<b>whether it's two thighs</b>

08:51.398 --> 08:53.433
<b>and a forearm or two forearms</b>
<b>and a thigh?</b>

08:53.433 --> 08:56.470
<b>- I'm a lot about symmetry,</b>
<b>so two thighs.</b>

08:56.470 --> 08:58.672
<b>- What are you gonna get?</b>
<b>- I want biomechanical tattoos</b>

08:58.672 --> 09:02.009
<b>as well on my forearms</b>
<b>and thighs or calves.</b>

09:02.009 --> 09:04.678
<b>- Front of the calves or back?</b>
<b>- Front.</b>

09:04.678 --> 09:06.013
<b>- Like the shin?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

09:06.013 --> 09:08.081

<b>- Two shins at the same time?</b>

09:09.416 --> 09:10.918
<b>- You wanna go color</b>

09:10.918 --> 09:13.120

<b>- Nothing's gonna</b>

09:13.120 --> 09:15.155
<b>change your mind?</b>
<b>- Nope, not even.</b>

09:15.155 --> 09:16.890
<b>- We really need</b>

09:16.890 --> 09:18.125
<b>easy to work with.</b>

09:18.125 --> 09:21.094
<b>If we get this canvas,</b>

<b>- No brainer in this one, right?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

09:23.764 --> 09:25.232
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- If we do the guy,</b>

09:25.232 --> 09:27.768
<b>he said he wants symmetry, so we</b>
<b>would only want his thighs.</b>

09:27.768 --> 09:30.804
<b>- Well, we can split</b>
<b>this [bleep], right?</b>

09:30.804 --> 09:33.607

09:33.607 --> 09:36.143

<b> <i>and do the best possible</i> </b>

09:39.079 --> 09:41.315

09:41.315 --> 09:42.816
<b>get a break on this.</b>

09:42.816 --> 09:47.621
<b>- He seems like he's more</b>

09:47.621 --> 09:49.056
<b>Let's do it.</b>

09:49.056 --> 09:51.859
<b>- All right, Team Peck,</b>
<b>which canvas do you choose?</b>

09:51.859 --> 09:53.927
<b>- We pick the gentleman.</b>

09:53.927 --> 09:57.731
<b>- All right, that means that</b>
<b>Team NuÃ±ez will get the lady.</b>

09:57.731 --> 09:59.733
<b>You'll have six hours</b>
<b>as a team</b>

09:59.733 --> 10:03.270
<b>tattooing at the same time</b>
<b>to transform your canvas</b>

10:03.270 --> 10:05.939

10:12.913 --> 10:15.048
<b>Let's go over here.</b>
<b>- All right, let's do it.</b>

10:15.048 --> 10:18.018

10:18.018 --> 10:21.455
<b>One of their guys is already</b>

10:21.455 --> 10:23.023
<b>So if only two of you</b>

10:23.023 --> 10:24.958
<b>I want to make sure</b>
<b>I make that.</b>

10:24.958 --> 10:26.660

10:26.660 --> 10:29.429
<b>One bad-ass, huge,</b>

10:29.429 --> 10:31.632
<b>that's one big tattoo</b>

10:31.632 --> 10:34.301
<b>- That would be really cool.</b>

10:34.301 --> 10:37.871

10:37.871 --> 10:40.908
<b> <i>Only having two tattooers today</i> </b>
<b> <i>that have a very similar style</i> </b>

10:40.908 --> 10:42.209
<b>is a definite advantage.</b>

10:42.209 --> 10:44.011
<b>- I thought we would have</b>
<b>a disadvantage</b>

10:44.011 --> 10:46.246
<b>'cause we're missing one person,</b>
<b>but this is better.</b>

10:47.714 --> 10:50.784
<b>- Just pick three different,</b>
<b>cool views that look mechanical,</b>

10:50.784 --> 10:53.754
<b>and then incorporate them</b>
<b>into the background.</b>

10:53.754 --> 10:56.623
<b>This being the consistency</b>
<b>challenge, all the line work</b>

10:56.623 --> 10:58.458
<b>needs to look clean</b>
<b>and the same,</b>

10:58.458 --> 11:00.727

<b>to get really involved</b>

11:00.727 --> 11:03.163

11:22.649 --> 11:24.184

<b>you have six hours to transform</b>
<b>your canvas into a cyborg.</b>

11:39.600 --> 11:42.436
<b>Remember, every hour,</b>

<b> <i>- Today's tattoo is a good test</i> </b>

12:04.291 --> 12:05.893

17:17.012 --> 17:20.015
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

17:20.015 --> 17:26.954
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

17:29.524 --> 17:31.727
<b>- Today, you had to</b>
<b>show consistency</b>

17:31.727 --> 17:36.298
<b>tattooing cyborg tattoos.</b>
<b>Remember, you're being judged</b>

17:36.298 --> 17:38.667
<b>as a team.</b>
<b>Let's see how you did.</b>

17:38.667 --> 17:40.469
<b>Team Peck, let's start with you.</b>

17:42.003 --> 17:45.474
<b>- Looking at the three tattoos,</b>
<b>they all have a consistent feel.</b>

17:45.474 --> 17:47.375
<b> <i>But there are</i> </b>
<b> <i>a couple of differences.</i> </b>

17:47.375 --> 17:50.345
<b> <i>The one with the trigger--</i> </b>
<b> <i>It looks like the smoothest</i> </b>

17:50.345 --> 17:53.982
<b> <i>of the three, it has a much</i> </b>
<b> <i>softer, powdery feel to it.</i> </b>

17:53.982 --> 17:56.318
<b>That's the one that's the most</b>
<b>open and the most readable.</b>

17:56.318 --> 17:58.754
<b> <i>Your other tattoos</i> </b>
<b> <i>have a lot of small,</i> </b>

17:58.754 --> 18:00.689
<b> <i>tucked away pieces</i> </b>
<b> <i>that are in there.</i> </b>

18:00.689 --> 18:03.759
<b> <i>The left leg is a lot heavier,</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot blacker, and a lot deeper</i> </b>

18:03.759 --> 18:06.528
<b> <i>in your outlines as opposed to</i> </b>
<b> <i>the other leg.</i> </b>

18:06.528 --> 18:09.531
<b> <i>Those outlines are thin.</i> </b>
<b> <i>There's a lot of wobbles.</i> </b>

18:09.531 --> 18:11.967
<b>- One thing I was unsure about</b>
<b>is, like, what is ripping out?</b>

18:11.967 --> 18:15.003
<b> <i>Is that supposed to be skin,</i> </b>
<b> <i>or plywood ripped open?</i> </b>

18:15.003 --> 18:17.005
<b>- For the skin rip?</b>
<b>- Oh, is that skin?</b>

18:17.005 --> 18:19.174
<b>- Yeah, what he asked us for</b>
<b>was almost like</b>

18:19.174 --> 18:22.310
<b>a striped, slashed,</b>
<b>sort of like a claw look.</b>

18:22.310 --> 18:23.879
<b>- I mean it looks like</b>
<b>you definitely did</b>

18:23.879 --> 18:26.348
<b>what he asked for,</b>
<b>and sometimes</b>

18:26.348 --> 18:27.849
<b>that can be a little bit</b>
<b>dangerous.</b>

18:27.849 --> 18:30.285
<b>- This is that type of skin rip</b>
<b>that has that tendency</b>

18:30.285 --> 18:32.687
<b>to look like bark.</b>
<b>It'll look cracked instead of</b>

18:32.687 --> 18:35.924
<b> <i>looking torn and flexible,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but the way you designed it</i> </b>

18:35.924 --> 18:37.325
<b> <i>and laid it out,</i> </b>
<b> <i>this is a design</i> </b>

18:37.325 --> 18:39.327
<b> <i>that can appeal to people</i> </b>
<b> <i>whether they know</i> </b>

18:39.327 --> 18:41.029
<b> <i>what this imagery is or not.</i> </b>

18:41.029 --> 18:43.598
<b>So I think it's a crowd-pleaser</b>
<b>all around.</b>

18:43.598 --> 18:44.599
<b>- Thank you.</b>

18:44.599 --> 18:47.602
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

18:47.602 --> 18:48.904
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

18:48.904 --> 18:51.073
<b>- Next up, Team NuÃ±ez.</b>

18:51.073 --> 18:54.876
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

18:54.876 --> 18:56.645
<b>- I think it's</b>
<b>a pretty good tattoo,</b>

18:56.645 --> 18:59.614
<b>but, I mean, I don't see</b>
<b>any kind of mechanical.</b>

18:59.614 --> 19:02.584
<b> <i>It doesn't say cyborg to me.</i> </b>
<b> <i>I would also say that</i> </b>

19:02.584 --> 19:05.754
<b>I don't think that the forehead</b>
<b>matches the rest of the skull.</b>

19:05.754 --> 19:07.823
<b> <i>It looks really smooth,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and it doesn't have</i> </b>

19:07.823 --> 19:11.526
<b> <i>as much texture, dimension</i> </b>
<b> <i>as the lower part of the face</i> </b>

19:11.526 --> 19:12.761
<b> <i>or the bottom of the jaw.</i> </b>

19:12.761 --> 19:14.696
<b>- That was a difficult tattoo.</b>

19:14.696 --> 19:16.598
<b>- In all honesty,</b>
<b>I truly believe</b>

19:16.598 --> 19:18.533
<b>that we gave her</b>
<b>a good tattoo,</b>

19:18.533 --> 19:20.602
<b>but it might have</b>
<b>gotten away from us.</b>

19:20.602 --> 19:24.439
<b>- Gotten away from you how?</b>
<b>Because the challenge was:</b>

19:24.439 --> 19:28.343
<b>transform your canvas</b>
<b>into a cyborg.</b>

19:28.343 --> 19:30.679
<b>- That's probably</b>
<b>what got away from us.</b>

19:30.679 --> 19:32.347
<b> <i>- When we take that,</i> </b>
<b> <i>you know, we can go down</i> </b>

19:32.347 --> 19:34.416
<b> <i>the route of biomech,</i> </b>
<b> <i>which we definitely did.</i> </b>

19:35.951 --> 19:39.154
<b>- It's a little more</b>
<b>bio-organic, heavy on the bio.</b>

19:39.154 --> 19:40.522
<b>- Light on the mech.</b>

19:40.522 --> 19:42.157
<b>Zero on the mech.</b>
<b>- That's why I'm trying</b>

19:42.157 --> 19:44.025
<b>not to talk right now.</b>
<b>- Well, I got a lot</b>

19:44.025 --> 19:45.594
<b>to talk about on this tattoo.</b>

19:45.594 --> 19:46.628
<b>- Oh, I know.</b>

19:46.628 --> 19:48.497
<b>- First of all, this strategy</b>

19:48.497 --> 19:50.532
<b>to turn your canvas</b>
<b>into a cyborg,</b>

19:50.532 --> 19:53.335
<b>and you give her a skull</b>
<b>in a cavernous setting,</b>

19:53.335 --> 19:55.804
<b> <i>I can see maybe</i> </b>
<b> <i>a little bit of bio,</i> </b>

19:55.804 --> 19:59.040
<b>but I don't see even a drop</b>
<b>of mech in this at all.</b>

19:59.040 --> 20:02.911
<b>So biomech is out,</b>
<b>cyborg is out.</b>

20:02.911 --> 20:05.247
<b>Consistency from</b>
<b>one leg to the other--</b>

20:05.247 --> 20:07.115
<b> <i>I don't think the skull</i> </b>
<b> <i>and the jaw bone</i> </b>

20:07.115 --> 20:09.951
<b> <i>look consistent in any way.</i> </b>
<b> <i>The bottom jaw looks</i> </b>

20:09.951 --> 20:12.888
<b> <i>like a totally separate thought</i> </b>
<b> <i>that doesn't go along</i> </b>

20:12.888 --> 20:14.656
<b>with the skull at all.</b>

20:14.656 --> 20:16.491
<b>I mean, you look at</b>
<b>the side of the jaw</b>

20:16.491 --> 20:19.261
<b>that's closest to us.</b>
<b>It's really thin,</b>

20:19.261 --> 20:21.563
<b> <i>and the one in the background,</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's super thick.</i> </b>

20:21.563 --> 20:24.266
<b> <i>It makes it hard for me</i> </b>
<b> <i>to know that's a jaw.</i> </b>

20:24.266 --> 20:26.268
<b> <i>From a distance,</i> </b>
<b> <i>it looks like just</i> </b>

20:26.268 --> 20:29.071
<b>a red oil rag</b>
<b>being thrown down a cave.</b>

20:29.071 --> 20:30.705
<b>- It was the most</b>
<b>stressful tattoo,</b>

20:30.705 --> 20:32.340
<b>I think, either of us</b>
<b>have done here.</b>

20:32.340 --> 20:33.575
<b>- We had some issues.</b>

20:33.575 --> 20:35.277
<b>Behind the skull,</b>
<b>we were supposed to have</b>

20:35.277 --> 20:37.279
<b> <i>all that weird,</i> </b>
<b> <i>connective biomech tissue.</i> </b>

20:37.279 --> 20:39.281
<b> <i>What you missed is just</i> </b>
<b> <i>doing those weird shapes</i> </b>

20:39.281 --> 20:41.049
<b>that we talked about doing,</b>
<b>and then coloring</b>

20:41.049 --> 20:43.085
<b>the same way you colored.</b>
<b>That would have been fine.</b>

20:43.085 --> 20:44.686
<b>You would have had it.</b>

20:44.686 --> 20:46.621
<b> <i>Problem is that we didn't</i> </b>
<b> <i>hit the look of the metal,</i> </b>

20:46.621 --> 20:48.924
<b> <i>and we didn't hit the look</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the biomech tissue</i> </b>

20:48.924 --> 20:50.425
<b>behind the skull.</b>

20:50.425 --> 20:52.794
<b>The things we talked about</b>
<b>got lost in translation.</b>

20:52.794 --> 20:54.996
<b>- What I will say in terms</b>
<b>of consistency here,</b>

20:54.996 --> 20:57.799
<b>it does look like</b>
<b>one artist did both tattoos.</b>

20:57.799 --> 20:59.134
<b> <i>The line weights</i> </b>
<b> <i>are consistent,</i> </b>

20:59.134 --> 21:00.535
<b> <i>shading is consistent.</i> </b>

21:00.535 --> 21:04.072
<b> <i>I do see remnants of</i> </b>
<b> <i>that biomechanical style</i> </b>

21:04.072 --> 21:06.241
<b>with these rock formations</b>
<b>that are coming out,</b>

21:06.241 --> 21:08.710
<b>so I see that as being</b>
<b>a consistent element there.</b>

21:08.710 --> 21:11.079
<b>So there are consistent</b>
<b>elements here,</b>

21:11.079 --> 21:12.914
<b>and that is one of the things</b>
<b>we're testing for.</b>

21:18.887 --> 21:20.756
<b>All right,</b>
<b>Team Peck and Team NuÃ±ez,</b>

21:20.756 --> 21:23.425
<b>this week there is no</b>
<b>jury of peers.</b>

21:23.425 --> 21:26.728
<b>The decision is completely</b>
<b>up to the judges.</b>

21:26.728 --> 21:29.131
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>
<b>We will call you back</b>

21:29.131 --> 21:31.466
<b>once we've reached a decision.</b>

21:35.537 --> 21:36.972
<b>- I think we got it.</b>
<b>- Got it.</b>

21:36.972 --> 21:38.840
<b>- I mean, hands down, dude.</b>
<b>We hit the challenge,</b>

21:38.840 --> 21:41.476
<b>we did a good tattoo,</b>
<b>it looks consistent.</b>

21:41.476 --> 21:43.145
<b>- I don't think they had any</b>
<b>cyborg piece</b>

21:43.145 --> 21:44.946
<b>of anything in theirs.</b>

21:44.946 --> 21:47.082
<b>- If it goes down</b>
<b>how it should go down today,</b>

21:47.082 --> 21:48.784
<b>we're gonna win this one,</b>
<b>and they're gonna</b>

21:48.784 --> 21:50.519
<b>have to battle it out.</b>
<b>- It's gonna be huge.</b>

21:50.519 --> 21:52.521
<b>- I'd rather see Nikki go.</b>

21:52.521 --> 21:54.489
<b>She's just more versatile,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

21:54.489 --> 21:56.825
<b>- I mean, one of them gone</b>
<b>makes it a whole lot easier</b>

21:56.825 --> 21:58.727
<b>to think about</b>
<b>being in the top three.</b>

21:58.727 --> 22:00.829
<b>- Hell yeah.</b>

22:00.829 --> 22:02.998
<b>- It sucked tattooing</b>
<b>on the opposite team.</b>

22:02.998 --> 22:04.566
<b>It [bleep] sucked.</b>

22:04.566 --> 22:07.469
<b>- There's no doubt</b>
<b>that we are going to the bottom.</b>

22:07.469 --> 22:09.237
<b>There's no doubt</b>
<b>that me and Kelly</b>

22:09.237 --> 22:10.839
<b>are gonna tattoo</b>
<b>against each other,</b>

22:10.839 --> 22:12.641
<b>and it sucks knowing</b>
<b>that there's tattooers</b>

22:12.641 --> 22:14.743
<b>like [bleep] Nate still here.</b>

22:14.743 --> 22:16.378
<b>- But--</b>
<b>- I'm gonna be home before</b>

22:16.378 --> 22:17.779
<b>that mother[bleep]?</b>

22:17.779 --> 22:19.281
<b>- Nikki--</b>
<b>- That's what upsets me.</b>

22:19.281 --> 22:21.717
<b>- You don't even know if--</b>
<b>You're jumping the gun--</b>

22:21.717 --> 22:23.685
<b>- You don't even know--</b>
<b>- Because it's obvious.</b>

22:23.685 --> 22:25.520
<b>- If you're going home.</b>
<b>- It's not obvious.</b>

22:25.520 --> 22:27.355
<b>- It's not obvious, Nikki.</b>
<b>We don't know what's</b>

22:27.355 --> 22:29.057
<b>going to happen.</b>
<b>Think about our alliance,</b>

22:29.057 --> 22:30.892
<b>think about what we're</b>
<b>here fighting for.</b>

22:30.892 --> 22:33.261
<b>- Well, if I tattoo</b>
<b>against Kelly,</b>

22:33.261 --> 22:36.631
<b>it would be insane</b>
<b>for either of us to go home.</b>

22:36.631 --> 22:37.899
<b>- Insanity.</b>

22:43.701 --> 22:46.704
<b> <i>[intense music]</i> </b>

22:46.704 --> 22:48.139
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

22:48.139 --> 22:49.607
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>today we are testing</b>

22:49.607 --> 22:52.343
<b>consistency</b>
<b>with cyborg tattoos.</b>

22:52.343 --> 22:54.913
<b>It's Team Peck</b>
<b>against Team NuÃ±ez.</b>

22:54.913 --> 22:56.681
<b>- I think there's</b>
<b>some consistency issues</b>

22:56.681 --> 22:58.416
<b> <i>with Team NuÃ±ez's tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>for sure.</i> </b>

22:58.416 --> 23:01.019
<b> <i>The skull versus the jaw,</i> </b>
<b> <i>not consistent</i> </b>

23:01.019 --> 23:03.488
<b> <i>in the slightest bit.</i> </b>
<b> <i>Quality of the black shading</i> </b>

23:03.488 --> 23:05.290
<b> <i>and quality of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the saturation of the red</i> </b>

23:05.290 --> 23:07.358
<b> <i>at the top of the head</i> </b>
<b> <i>is nowhere near the same</i> </b>

23:07.358 --> 23:08.626
<b> <i>as it is at the bottom,</i> </b>

23:08.626 --> 23:10.094
<b>and on top of that--</b>
<b>- But does it look like</b>

23:10.094 --> 23:11.930
<b>the same tattooer</b>
<b>did both tattoos?</b>

23:11.930 --> 23:14.232
<b>- Um...</b>
<b>- It does.</b>

23:14.232 --> 23:16.067
<b>- Team NuÃ±ez did</b>
<b>a pretty good job</b>

23:16.067 --> 23:17.635
<b>of making it look</b>
<b>like one artist did it,</b>

23:17.635 --> 23:21.005
<b>but how important is following</b>
<b>the theme of the challenge?</b>

23:21.005 --> 23:22.707
<b>- Very important.</b>
<b>- Massively important.</b>

23:22.707 --> 23:25.076
<b>- They could have done</b>
<b>any tattoo that they wanted to.</b>

23:25.076 --> 23:27.579
<b> <i>- The thought pattern here</i> </b>
<b> <i>was to do one big design</i> </b>

23:27.579 --> 23:29.881
<b> <i>that spanned across,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but the connective tissue</i> </b>

23:29.881 --> 23:32.383
<b> <i>was the biomech</i> </b>
<b> <i>background filler.</i> </b>

23:32.383 --> 23:34.285
<b>And so that was really</b>
<b>where the girls were like,</b>

23:34.285 --> 23:35.920
<b>yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it,</b>
<b>we got it, we know, we know.</b>

23:35.920 --> 23:37.455
<b>And they never did it.</b>

23:37.455 --> 23:38.690
<b>- Waaah!</b>

23:38.690 --> 23:40.191
<b>- Why would you--</b>
<b>- Please make a state--</b>

23:40.191 --> 23:41.860
<b>- Why would you create--</b>
<b>Why would you make a bunch</b>

23:41.860 --> 23:43.294
<b>of plywood</b>
<b>with machinery under it?</b>

23:43.294 --> 23:44.963
<b>That's "waaah" too.</b>
<b>- It's not a real human.</b>

23:44.963 --> 23:46.931
<b>It's fake skin.</b>
<b>- From a distance,</b>

23:46.931 --> 23:49.400
<b> <i>that guy looks like</i> </b>
<b> <i>he's got ripped up old jeans.</i> </b>

23:49.400 --> 23:51.135
<b>- This is a clear winner.</b>
<b>- This is your team.</b>

23:51.135 --> 23:52.737
<b>- I know, but there's</b>
<b>a clear winner.</b>

23:52.737 --> 23:56.407
<b>- As far as hitting the cyborg</b>
<b>challenge, Team Peck crushed it.</b>

23:56.407 --> 23:57.542
<b>How about on consistency?</b>

23:57.542 --> 23:59.210
<b>- Well, I can make</b>
<b>a strong case--</b>

23:59.210 --> 24:01.412
<b>- Well, you need a strong case</b>
<b>'cause your team [bleep] up.</b>

24:01.412 --> 24:02.647
<b>- I disagree.</b>
<b>- I know you do--</b>

24:02.647 --> 24:04.015
<b>- Talk to me about how you</b>
<b>disagree--</b>

24:04.015 --> 24:05.617
<b>- Because you disagree</b>
<b>because it's your team,</b>

24:05.617 --> 24:07.085
<b>you wanna lawyer up--</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

24:07.085 --> 24:08.753
<b>- But to have one whole leg</b>
<b>that's just nothing</b>

24:08.753 --> 24:10.121
<b>but a wet rag floating</b>
<b>in a cave.</b>

24:10.121 --> 24:11.422
<b>- It's a skull.</b>

24:11.422 --> 24:13.858
<b>- There's nothing cyborg</b>
<b>about that tattoo.</b>

24:15.493 --> 24:17.328
<b>- One of us is going home.</b>
<b>- Yep.</b>

24:17.328 --> 24:20.632
<b>- And that's the reality of it.</b>
<b>- Neither of us deserve to go.</b>

24:20.632 --> 24:22.767
<b>- It should be Nate.</b>
<b>Nate should be the one</b>

24:22.767 --> 24:24.202
<b>going home</b>
<b>before me or Kelly.</b>

24:24.202 --> 24:25.904
<b>- That's a bold statement.</b>

24:25.904 --> 24:27.939
<b>- It's bold, but you've also</b>
<b>been pretty bold as [bleep]</b>

24:27.939 --> 24:29.607
<b>with what you've said</b>
<b>about tattooing.</b>

24:29.607 --> 24:32.076
<b>- I'm playing the underdog.</b>
<b>That was my strategy.</b>

24:32.076 --> 24:34.612
<b>Play it mediocre.</b>
<b>- You're not even trying</b>

24:34.612 --> 24:36.614
<b>to put out</b>
<b>your best possible work?</b>

24:36.614 --> 24:39.350
<b>- It makes no [bleep] sense.</b>
<b>- I have had not one</b>

24:39.350 --> 24:41.653

<b>They're people.</b>

24:44.889 --> 24:46.858
<b>- Everybody gets</b>

24:46.858 --> 24:49.260

24:49.260 --> 24:51.629
<b>I've tattooed, and it sucks</b>

24:54.365 --> 24:55.967

24:55.967 --> 24:58.136
<b>- No, I think you're pretty</b>
<b>[bleep] jaded at this point.</b>

24:58.136 --> 24:59.737
<b>- You can twist it</b>

24:59.737 --> 25:01.573
<b>- It's not a [bleep] twist.</b>
<b>You know it's the truth.</b>

<b>- It's not, it's not how it is.</b>
<b>- Yeah, you--you said</b>

<b>- Y'all hit it.</b>
<b>In the cyborg element,</b>

25:29.667 --> 25:32.303
<b>you've shown a lot of mechanical</b>

25:32.303 --> 25:34.305

25:34.305 --> 25:35.840

25:35.840 --> 25:38.543

25:38.543 --> 25:40.678
<b>- This means that</b>

26:15.313 --> 26:18.416
<b>Team Peck, because you won</b>

26:18.416 --> 26:22.353

26:39.571 --> 26:40.538
<b>That's my vote.</b>

26:45.043 --> 26:47.178
<b>We're gonna go with</b>

26:47.178 --> 26:48.613
<b>- Any style.</b>
<b>- In four hours?</b>

26:48.613 --> 26:50.415
<b>- I'll take it.</b>
<b>- It's fine.</b>

26:50.415 --> 26:52.383
<b>- We just felt like</b>

26:55.353 --> 26:56.721

<b>This hurts,</b>
<b>but this is the game.</b>

27:10.168 --> 27:13.137
<b>- Since consistency</b>

<b>of this tattoo,</b>
<b>I'd make sure that</b>

27:14.806 --> 27:18.243
<b>whatever her headdress is,</b>
<b>or her hair, matches the face,</b>

27:18.243 --> 27:20.745

27:20.745 --> 27:22.213

27:22.213 --> 27:24.516
<b>One little flaw</b>

29:59.593 --> 30:02.863
<b>pretty traditional,</b>
<b>red rose, green.</b>

30:02.863 --> 30:05.766

<b> <i>I love Nikki, I love her</i> </b>

33:53.078 --> 33:56.147

35:24.102 --> 35:26.204
<b>- Overall, I love it,</b>

35:26.204 --> 35:28.473
<b>I love the look of it</b>

35:28.473 --> 35:31.109
<b> <i>It's just a great drawing.</i> </b>
<b> <i>For me, where you lose</i> </b>

35:31.109 --> 35:33.678
<b>some of the structure</b>
<b>is in the headdress.</b>

35:33.678 --> 35:36.448
<b> <i>The blending is not</i> </b>
<b> <i>as well-executed</i> </b>

35:36.448 --> 35:38.517
<b> <i>as in the hair</i> </b>
<b> <i>and in the face.</i> </b>

35:38.517 --> 35:41.286
<b>- I intentionally tried</b>
<b>to let it breathe.</b>

35:41.286 --> 35:43.054
<b>- It doesn't quite</b>
<b>match the face.</b>

35:43.054 --> 35:45.257
<b> <i>It could have had</i> </b>
<b> <i>a little more depth in the back</i> </b>

35:45.257 --> 35:48.527
<b>'cause it looks almost the same</b>
<b>as the front and the top.</b>

35:48.527 --> 35:51.329
<b>- I don't mind the headdress</b>
<b>because it looks like fabric.</b>

35:51.329 --> 35:53.965
<b>She's gorgeous,</b>
<b>and I think that</b>

35:53.965 --> 35:58.770
<b>there is a consistency</b>
<b>not only in your application</b>

<b>of your line work</b>

<b>Super happy for you.</b>

36:09.447 --> 36:14.085
<b>- Kelly.</b>
<b>Team Peck offered up any style.</b>

36:14.085 --> 36:16.588
<b>Why did you choose</b>
<b>this particular direction?</b>

36:16.588 --> 36:19.791
<b> <i>- I haven't known you guys</i> </b>
<b> <i>to love new-school,</i> </b>

36:19.791 --> 36:22.427
<b> <i>but it's what I love</i> </b>
<b> <i>more than anything.</i> </b>

36:22.427 --> 36:25.697
<b> <i>She's a gypsy girl,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but she's bummed out,</i> </b>

36:25.697 --> 36:28.333
<b> <i>and her makeup's running,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and she's spooky,</i> </b>

36:28.333 --> 36:30.101
<b>and that's what I am.</b>

36:30.101 --> 36:32.103
<b>- I think this</b>
<b>is a pretty immaculate tattoo.</b>

36:32.103 --> 36:35.674
<b> <i>I mean, it's really hard</i> </b>
<b> <i>for me to point out anything</i> </b>

36:35.674 --> 36:38.510

<b> <i>is technically wrong with it.</i> </b>

36:38.510 --> 36:41.713
<b> <i>The line work is flawless,</i> </b>
<b> <i>there's a lot of consistency</i> </b>

<b> <i>Yeah, I'm not, like,</i> </b>

36:44.049 --> 36:45.951
<b>even crazy about</b>
<b>new-school tattoos,</b>

36:45.951 --> 36:47.385
<b>but I really like this one.</b>

36:47.385 --> 36:50.288
<b>- What I like about it the most</b>
<b>is the color palette.</b>

36:50.288 --> 36:52.090
<b> <i>This gray-ish tone</i> </b>
<b> <i>that's off of the person's</i> </b>

36:52.090 --> 36:54.693
<b> <i>natural skin tone,</i> </b>
<b> <i>very soft, very smooth.</i> </b>

36:54.693 --> 36:56.394
<b>- Beautiful work</b>
<b>in the head wrap.</b>

36:56.394 --> 37:00.398
<b> <i>It's blended so nicely, high</i> </b>
<b> <i>gloss and really bright.</i> </b>

37:00.398 --> 37:02.734
<b>The only area</b>
<b>that I would really say</b>

37:02.734 --> 37:06.071
<b>has any inconsistencies</b>
<b>is gonna be the jewels up top.</b>

37:06.071 --> 37:09.140
<b>The shapes of each one</b>
<b>aren't exactly perfect,</b>

37:09.140 --> 37:12.344
<b>but overall I think you both</b>
<b>did beautiful tattoos.</b>

<b>You both did</b>

37:28.660 --> 37:30.562

37:30.562 --> 37:34.032

<b>I mean, it's--I identify with</b>

37:34.032 --> 37:35.534
<b>the style that Nikki did</b>
<b>a lot more,</b>

37:35.534 --> 37:40.772
<b>but Kelly did such a great job</b>
<b>on every aspect of her tattoo.</b>

37:40.772 --> 37:42.908
<b> <i>- But if you look at</i> </b>
<b> <i>the face versus face,</i> </b>

37:42.908 --> 37:46.178
<b> <i>you're instantly more drawn</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the beauty of Nikki's face.</i> </b>

37:46.178 --> 37:48.113
<b>If you just look at</b>
<b>rose for rose,</b>

37:48.113 --> 37:51.716
<b> <i>artistically and technically,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I like Kelly's rose better.</i> </b>

37:51.716 --> 37:54.586
<b>- I'm opposite you--</b>
<b>I like Nikki's rose</b>

37:54.586 --> 37:55.787
<b>better than Kelly's.</b>

37:55.787 --> 37:57.589
<b>- If you look at</b>
<b>these scarves...</b>

37:57.589 --> 37:59.257
<b> <i>- Saturation versus</i> </b>
<b> <i>saturation, Kelly--</i> </b>

37:59.257 --> 38:00.659
<b> <i>- Kelly's--Kelly's got</i> </b>
<b> <i>the scarf.</i> </b>

38:00.659 --> 38:02.727
<b>- Yeah, Kelly gets the scarf.</b>
<b>I mean, the consistency</b>

38:02.727 --> 38:04.429
<b>throughout is gonna be</b>
<b>a big part of it,</b>

38:04.429 --> 38:06.164
<b>and that's the challenge.</b>
<b>- That's what I'm saying.</b>

38:06.164 --> 38:07.599
<b>- It's--It's two</b>
<b>different styles,</b>

38:07.599 --> 38:09.267
<b>and you gotta take</b>
<b>your own personal likes</b>

38:09.267 --> 38:10.902
<b>and dislikes out of it,</b>
<b>and you look at</b>

38:10.902 --> 38:13.104
<b>technically applied.</b>
<b>It's hard to find very many</b>

38:13.104 --> 38:15.240
<b>technical mistakes</b>
<b>in Kelly's tattoo at all.</b>

38:15.240 --> 38:17.342
<b>- There's--It's not easy</b>
<b>to find a technical mistake</b>

38:17.342 --> 38:18.610
<b>in Nikki's either.</b>

38:18.610 --> 38:20.078
<b>- They both look like</b>
<b>they're just</b>

38:20.078 --> 38:23.215
<b>printed onto that skin.</b>
<b>I mean, you guys picked</b>

38:23.215 --> 38:24.883
<b>this challenge,</b>
<b>what do you think?</b>

38:24.883 --> 38:26.218
<b>- That's not for me to decide.</b>

38:26.218 --> 38:27.352
<b>- Who do you guys think won?</b>

38:27.352 --> 38:28.520
<b>- I think Kelly won.</b>

38:28.520 --> 38:29.855
<b>- I don't know.</b>
<b>I would tattoo it</b>

38:29.855 --> 38:32.491
<b>more like Nikki,</b>
<b>but I liked Kelly's</b>

38:32.491 --> 38:36.461
<b>consistency in that tattoo.</b>
<b>It's immaculate.</b>

38:36.461 --> 38:38.029

38:38.029 --> 38:40.532
<b>Who is going home?</b>

38:40.532 --> 38:42.501
<b>- I mean, if I only look</b>
<b>at Nikki's face,</b>

38:42.501 --> 38:44.402
<b>it's hard to vote her home</b>
<b>off of that tattoo.</b>

38:44.402 --> 38:46.705
<b> <i>That is a [bleep]</i> </b>

38:48.039 --> 38:49.708
<b>I'm voting for Kelly.</b>

<b>One vote for Nikki,</b>
<b>one vote for Kelly.</b>

38:56.047 --> 38:58.717
<b>- Kelly's is just immaculate,</b>
<b>and Nikki's--</b>

38:58.717 --> 39:01.086
<b>the headdress just</b>
<b>falls a little bit short.</b>

39:01.086 --> 39:03.622
<b>I think I'm gonna have to</b>
<b>vote for Nikki too.</b>

39:03.622 --> 39:05.557

39:05.557 --> 39:06.591

39:08.226 --> 39:10.128
<b>I gotta vote for Nikki.</b>

39:10.128 --> 39:11.530
<b>It's crazy.</b>

<b>Nikki, you do not have</b>

<b>what it takes</b>
<b>to be Ink Master.</b>

39:18.837 --> 39:20.805

<b>on my team, I would have you</b>

<b>over and over and over.</b>
<b>I love watching you tattoo.</b>
