-[groaning]

00:50.759 --> 00:52.135
[grunting]

00:54.388 --> 00:55.305
[moaning]

00:55.847 --> 00:57.558
I think I just broke my butt.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.268
Were this an actual battle, Trollhunter...

00:59.351 --> 01:03.814
you would have just been deprived
of your right leg, three fingers...

01:03.897 --> 01:05.107
[gasping]

01:05.190 --> 01:06.441
and your gronk-nuks.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.278
Sorry, I guess I'm just
a little distracted tonight.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.362
[yelping, grunting]

01:10.445 --> 01:13.448
Bular will use your distraction
as an opportunity...

01:13.532 --> 01:15.367
to cleave your head from your shoulders.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.203
-Oh.
-What has you distracted this night?

01:18.287 --> 01:20.289
-You wouldn't understand.
-[roaring]

01:20.372 --> 01:23.667
I am a son of the former Trollhunter,
Trollhunter.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.044
I'm a little preoccupied
about kissing Claire.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.671
I don't understand.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.923
The school play, <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

01:30.007 --> 01:33.802
We're rehearsing the kissing scene
and I have to kiss her tomorrow.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.012
Kissing?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.223
What is this kissing?

01:38.307 --> 01:41.768
When two people like each other,
they put their mouths together.

01:41.852 --> 01:45.147
And depending on how much
you like them, the longer the kiss.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.024
-Sometimes for hours.
-[groaning]

01:47.107 --> 01:49.401
Disgusting.
Killing sounds easier.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.363
Draal, I really like her.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.658
If I blow our first kiss,
I might not get a second, or a third.

01:56.742 --> 01:57.868
You're afraid.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.202
I know, I know.

01:59.286 --> 02:05.626
The first rule, "Always be afraid."
But that's with Trolls, not girls.

02:05.709 --> 02:09.378
Girls are, like, the opposite of Trolls.

02:09.463 --> 02:13.216
I once had similar stirrings
for an Impure.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.469
I know of something that may help.

02:15.552 --> 02:19.348
If these "girls" require you
not to be afraid...

02:19.431 --> 02:21.475
then you need a Grit-Shaka.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.768
Is that a protein shake?

02:22.851 --> 02:25.562
A Grit-Shaka is a totem
used by the Gumm-Gumms.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.190
If you wear it, it banishes
all cowardice...

02:28.273 --> 02:30.400
makes you fierce and ready for battle.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.360
Hmm...

02:31.443 --> 02:33.445
You wouldn't happen to have
one of these, would you?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.280
Hmm...

02:35.364 --> 02:37.532
-[bell ringing]
-[cooing to baby]

02:38.700 --> 02:40.410
-[giggling]
-<i>Qué precioso.</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:41.870
Boo!
[gasping]

02:41.953 --> 02:43.288
<i>Sí, guapo.</i>

02:43.372 --> 02:45.916
-Hello.
-[cell phone ringing]

02:47.042 --> 02:48.794
This is Councilwoman Nuñez.

02:48.877 --> 02:49.920
[blowing raspberry]

02:50.003 --> 02:51.338
What's that?

02:52.464 --> 02:53.757
It's just...

02:53.840 --> 02:56.551
We are meeting today
to activate the Eyestone.

02:56.635 --> 03:00.013
You mean, we're gonna finally be able
to talk to the big honcho?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.181
Oh, I can't.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.558
Your prize pupil did a number
on me new home

03:03.642 --> 03:05.685
and now I can't leave the house.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.062
You've been exposed!

03:07.145 --> 03:08.730
What was I supposed to do?

03:08.814 --> 03:11.108
The fleshbags used a Gaggletack on me!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.651
Bular will be upset.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.653
This could be a good thing!

03:14.736 --> 03:16.905
They think I'm helping them.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.199
-I've learned things.
-Like?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.493
Yes, I'll be happy to go.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.579
Mr. Six-Eyes
and Big Scary Name...

03:24.663 --> 03:25.789
Blinky and Aaarrrgghh.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.624
Yeah.
The big one don't talk much...

03:27.707 --> 03:30.043
but the smart one's
certainly taken to the boy.

03:30.127 --> 03:34.089
You should've seen how he stood up for him
against the old goat man.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.924
Mr. Trollmarket.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.510
Vendel?
Wait, you've been to Trollmarket?

03:38.593 --> 03:41.221
[chuckling]
They take me all the time now.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.515
From now on, you report only to me.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.852
Perhaps there are some things
Bular doesn't need to know.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.813
Go ahead and do that.
Enjoy your day.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.315
Who is a lovely adorable baby?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.901
Wish they could stay
that age forever, right?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.405
[blowing raspberry, giggling]

03:58.488 --> 04:01.158
Mr. Strickler's out today,
so I'm subbing.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.327
He asked me to fill in
to teach you some history.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.539
So without further ado,
I present <i>Gun Robot 3!</i>

04:07.998 --> 04:10.625
-[cheering]
-<i>Gun Robot 3.</i>

04:11.418 --> 04:13.628
So, today's the big day.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.214
El smoocho, doth yonder.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.716
Got any breath mints?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.091
I got sweaty palms.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.385
What if I do it weird?

04:20.469 --> 04:21.553
What if I can't breathe?

04:21.636 --> 04:22.929
Look at her.
Look at her!

04:23.013 --> 04:25.515
How can she be so calm?
[sighing]

04:25.599 --> 04:27.642
Don't act coy, C-Bomb.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.519
I know it's all you're thinking about.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.480
It's just acting, Mare.
Nothing more.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.357
Nothing more than a little of this.
[blowing kisses]

04:34.441 --> 04:36.318
-[giggling]
-Mary!

04:39.237 --> 04:42.365
What you two need
is a little chemistry lesson.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.367
Chemistry?
Wait, Mary, don't!

04:44.451 --> 04:47.204
Coach Lawrence?
Jim took my seat.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.997
Lake, give her back her seat.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.875
[man in film]
<i>Look out! Left flank!</i>

04:51.958 --> 04:54.085
Hey! Weirdo.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.629
<i>Gun Robot right around the side!</i>

04:55.712 --> 04:57.672
<i>We're losing men too fast!</i>

04:57.756 --> 04:59.007
[chuckling]

04:59.090 --> 05:00.675
<i>I'm by myself.</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:03.220
[whispers] Talk to her!

05:03.929 --> 05:05.680
[inhaling]

05:10.894 --> 05:13.355
<i>You're more than a hired gun, Gun Robot.</i>

05:14.397 --> 05:16.900
<i>You're also my friend.</i>

05:17.359 --> 05:19.736
[Gun Robot] <i>I am just Gun Robot.</i>

05:19.820 --> 05:21.321
[gasping]

05:21.404 --> 05:22.572
[cracking neck]

05:24.616 --> 05:25.450
So...

05:26.201 --> 05:27.953
this is awkward, right?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.329
Stage kiss.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.541
And they say comedy is hard.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.042
I know, right?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.210
Can you believe it?

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
It's like the whole school
is suddenly interested in our play.

05:37.796 --> 05:41.341
Full disclosure,
Toby even gave me breath mints!

05:41.424 --> 05:43.301
[giggling, snorts]

05:43.385 --> 05:45.637
-[laughing]
-Whoa!

05:45.720 --> 05:47.347
Hey, Mary!

05:47.430 --> 05:48.974
You got a date for the play?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.141
You do now.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.102
I'm in the play, you dork.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.353
Don't gross me out.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.688
Noted.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.022
[man] <i>You shot me!</i>

05:56.106 --> 05:58.108
[groaning]

05:58.275 --> 06:00.360
These things are like bear traps.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.990
Whoa, you opened your locker
on the first try!

06:05.073 --> 06:07.242
Tobes, it's the Grit-Shaka.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.868
That thing has a name?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.412
It's like a courage totem.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.539
Draal gave it to me
for the kissing scene today...

06:12.622 --> 06:14.124
and, oh, man, Tobes!

06:14.207 --> 06:16.835
You should've heard me with her in class!

06:16.918 --> 06:18.253
I was killing it!

06:18.336 --> 06:20.589
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry. Time out, time out.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.550
Draal, our Draal,
is helping you with chicks?

06:23.633 --> 06:28.096
It's supposed to make you brave,
but, man, I am feeling really good!

06:28.179 --> 06:30.307
It makes me feel like I can do anything.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.518
Wow.
It made you cool.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.521
Huh. I'm not just cool, Tobes.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.273
I'm crispy.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.734
-High-five!
-[groaning] Whatever.

06:40.817 --> 06:41.693
Crispy?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.155
So, what's the special, Judy?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.699
Besides that lovely smile on your face.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.117
Chicken Surprise.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.077
[gasping] Chicken Surprise?
No one orders that.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.706
-It's like a death sentence!
-Bring on the surprise!

06:54.789 --> 06:56.291
-[groaning]
-[gasping]

06:57.626 --> 06:59.085
Make it two?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.129
-[toilet flushing]
-[groaning]

07:01.212 --> 07:02.964
I feel horrible.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.050
Whoo! I feel cleansed!

07:05.133 --> 07:06.176
What should I do now?

07:07.594 --> 07:08.887
[breathing heavily, farting]

07:08.970 --> 07:10.931
-Oh, no!
-[stomach rumbling]

07:12.223 --> 07:13.391
Everything hurts.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.772
And that is how you solve for "x."

07:20.315 --> 07:23.193
Well, I admire your gusto,
Mr. Lake...

07:23.276 --> 07:25.487
but that is not remotely correct.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.156
And this isn't your class.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.950
Ms. Janeth,
she is not married, no?

07:30.033 --> 07:30.867
[whistling]

07:30.951 --> 07:32.619
This is the Teacher's Lounge, Señor Lake.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.538
-Students are forbidden.
-Which is exactly why I'm here.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.874
Testing limits, breaking rules, plus...

07:38.667 --> 07:41.419
ah... best java in school.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.047
Thing is, I don't even like coffee.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.091
<i>¡Hasta luego!</i>

07:46.174 --> 07:47.717
[whistling]

07:47.801 --> 07:49.052
Hey, Claire, have you seen Jim?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.387
I kinda lost track of him.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.514
Yeah, what's going on?
Everyone's talking about him.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.600
He's been all over school
making a spectacle of himself.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.602
-[loudspeaker blaring]
-<i>Hey, everybody, Jimmy Lake here.</i>

07:57.686 --> 08:01.398
<i>Just a quick reminder for everybody</i>
<i>to keep it crispy.</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:03.942
<i>Also, I taught myself</i>
<i>bass guitar in the band room.</i>

08:04.025 --> 08:06.820
<i>-This one goes out to my Juliet.</i>
-[gasping]

08:06.903 --> 08:10.323
-[playing bass]
<i>-When our lips meet, fireworks!</i>

08:10.407 --> 08:12.409
[teacher] <i>How'd you get in here?</i>
<i>Give me that thing!</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.202
[Jim] <i>You can't stop the passion, man!</i>

08:14.285 --> 08:16.287
<i>-You can only fuel the fire!</i>
-[groaning]

08:16.371 --> 08:17.622
[teacher]
<i>Yeah? Watch me!</i>

08:17.706 --> 08:19.290
This is bad.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.675
We've been waiting.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.635
Are we quite ready?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.636
Then let's party.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.056
[gasping]
The Eyestone!

08:35.140 --> 08:38.393
The last piece, it is complete.
[chuckling]

08:50.155 --> 08:51.406
[giggling]

08:51.990 --> 08:54.242
[laughing]

08:58.329 --> 08:59.456
It doesn't work.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.958
Bular, patience.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.430
[gasping]

09:20.018 --> 09:22.437
[everyone gasping]

09:25.607 --> 09:26.983
Son!

09:27.567 --> 09:29.611
[screaming, panting]

09:29.694 --> 09:31.112
Father.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.907
His voice is so scary.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.661
Father, your release from exile
will soon be at hand...

09:38.745 --> 09:39.662
Your dark excellence.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.623
-I am humbly in your service.
-[growling]

09:41.706 --> 09:45.335
Killahead is nearly complete
and you soon will be free.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.630
This pleases me, Stricklander.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.633
You have done well.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.801
You hum--
[gasping]

09:52.884 --> 09:55.637
Father, the mantle of Trollhunter
has fallen to a human.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.932
And this Impure has ordered me
not to harm the boy...

09:59.015 --> 10:03.186
Your Excellence, killing a human child
will bring too much scrutiny down upon us.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.522
And he has forbidden me
to take the Amulet from him.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.275
Lord Gunmar, until the Bridge is complete,
it is ill-advised to--

10:09.359 --> 10:10.902
Enough!

10:10.985 --> 10:12.570
[groaning]

10:12.654 --> 10:18.535
You make my exile even all the more
intolerable for your bickering.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.206
Stricklander is correct.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.958
Nothing is more important

10:25.041 --> 10:29.587
than preventing our plan from
being discovered by our enemies.

10:29.671 --> 10:34.801
But from now on, my son
will be giving the orders.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.427
[chuckling]

10:36.511 --> 10:39.931
I will speak with my son, alone.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.015
Now!

10:42.058 --> 10:45.228
As you wish, Your Greatness.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.569
-[chuckling]
-[snarls]

10:55.280 --> 10:58.741
What has become of Stricklander?

10:58.825 --> 11:02.120
He appears to have grown soft.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.455
In his human guise,
he has become the boy's teacher.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.584
I believe he has affection for the child.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.128
You question his loyalties?

11:10.211 --> 11:11.921
I do, Father.

11:13.423 --> 11:18.011
If his heart has turned, we must know.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.470
Test him.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.889
With pleasure.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.808
[Blinky] Higher.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.101
Just a little higher.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.436
Arms hurt.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.980
Focus on how much Master Jim's
arms will hurt

11:29.063 --> 11:31.107
should this training equipment
malfunction.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.191
Blinky! Blinky!
Wingman!

11:32.275 --> 11:33.568
We've got trouble!

11:33.651 --> 11:35.278
It's Draal.
I mean, it's Jim.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.113
-But it's Draal's fault.
-Did Draal kill him?

11:37.196 --> 11:40.158
Never should have consented to Draal
supplementing Master Jim's training.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.160
He didn't kill him.
He gave him something.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.495
It's like a totem.
A "great shake" or something.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.664
-It's making Jim crazy.
-Crazy?

11:46.748 --> 11:48.166
Yeah!
It's like he's drunk or something.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.419
He's completely without fear
or impulse control.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.463
And he's totally "crispy."

11:53.546 --> 11:56.299
Tobias, this totem,
was it a Grit-Shaka?

11:56.382 --> 11:59.010
-Yes! That's it!
-No fear.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.471
That's how it works on Troll physiology.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.681
But how will it act on a human?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.225
Oh, be some other name.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.269
What's in a name?

12:08.353 --> 12:11.606
That which we call a rose,
by any other name would smell as sweet.

12:11.689 --> 12:15.109
Not as sweet as thee, milady.

12:15.193 --> 12:20.114
And Romeo is here
and ready to bring the thunder.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.909
That's not the line, Jim.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.329
Yeah,
I had a few thoughts about the script.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.122
You rewrote Shakespeare?

12:28.206 --> 12:30.917
I punched up the comedy,
amped up the action...

12:31.000 --> 12:34.462
added a little more,
<i>je ne sais quoi</i>, romance.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.547
He rewrote Shakespeare.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.675
-Oh. A car chase.
-What?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.843
After a few hundred years,

12:40.927 --> 12:42.762
the play was just feeling
a little dated, you know?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.430
And what's with all the deaths?

12:44.514 --> 12:47.183
Gosh!
What is this, a tragedy?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.061
Be that as it may, Mr. Lake...

12:50.144 --> 12:53.815
we've spent months
rehearsing the "dated" pages.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.985
So, how about we do it
the way it was originally written?

12:57.068 --> 13:00.196
Sure. What say we bore
the audience with your acting.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.156
[groaning]
What's going on?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.033
You used to be the nicest guy.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.954
Now you're throwing parties,
trashing my house, and now this?

13:08.037 --> 13:08.955
Nice.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.081
This isn't you, Jim.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.833
It's me.
It's totally me!

13:11.916 --> 13:13.376
Just the better me.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.920
Well, it's not better.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.380
I know you think you're being cool...

13:17.463 --> 13:18.464
You're right.
You're right.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.676
I'm not cool.
I'm crispy!

13:21.759 --> 13:23.553
-What?
-[yelping]

13:24.971 --> 13:27.515
Call it what you want,
but you're being a jerk.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.225
No kiss then?

13:30.309 --> 13:32.729
No skin off my back!
Didn't want it anyway!

13:32.812 --> 13:35.314
Aw! What about the car chase?

13:35.398 --> 13:39.527
Give me a tattoo of a broken heart.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.864
With a crack in the middle.
And make it weep.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.615
Cease this madness!

13:44.699 --> 13:46.743
Hey!
Perfect timing, buds!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.037
Let's all get tats! [laughs]

13:49.120 --> 13:51.080
Fellowship!
High-five?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.458
If you would give us a moment.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.211
Great Gronka Morka,
it's even worse than you said.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.297
Master Jim, the Grit-Shaka.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.174
Ha, ha! Cool, right?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.509
I mean, crispy.

14:03.593 --> 14:07.180
I was thinking more along the lines
of "unholy" and "disturbing."

14:07.263 --> 14:09.557
-Dangerous!
-That, too.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.436
Master Jim, that is a Gumm-Gumm totem,
reason enough to be wary of it.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.190
But the fact that you are a human
makes its effects unpredictable!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.442
And that necklace
is not a good look for you.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is this? An intervention?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.653
If need be.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.655
Well, need not be!

14:24.739 --> 14:26.866
I'm fine.
I am better than fine.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.036
And if you want the Grit-Shaka,
you're gonna have to take it from me.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.663
[sighing] Come on, Jimbo.
We don't have to go there.

14:32.747 --> 14:37.418
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

14:37.502 --> 14:39.087
Holla!

14:41.422 --> 14:42.465
[moaning]

14:43.883 --> 14:45.093
Or maybe we do.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.302
That's right! Uh-huh!

14:46.386 --> 14:47.345
I just went there!

14:47.970 --> 14:50.056
-[growling]
-Be gentle with him.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.558
-[laughing]
-[roaring]

14:52.642 --> 14:54.394
[yelling]

14:54.477 --> 14:55.603
A-ha!

14:55.686 --> 14:57.313
Grit-Shaka has changed him, indeed.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.440
Master Jim was never this nimble.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.900
I mean, this is terrible!

15:00.983 --> 15:01.818
Jim!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.529
Master Jim, I beg you,
do not lose yourself.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.656
Lose?
I found myself!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.324
And I wasn't even looking for me.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.702
The Grit-Shaka's effect on you is false,
which makes it dangerous.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.704
You should always be afraid!

15:13.788 --> 15:16.624
-If Bular attacked you in this state...
-Hiyah!

15:16.707 --> 15:19.544
...you would not be able
to defend yourself.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.546
Oh, yeah?
I'll show you.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.674
I'm not afraid of Bular!
I'm not afraid of anything!

15:25.258 --> 15:27.427
Wait a minute.
[laughing]

15:29.178 --> 15:31.055
[gnomes cheering]

15:31.973 --> 15:33.641
[screaming]

15:34.725 --> 15:36.018
[yipping]

15:36.102 --> 15:37.353
Scum of the Earth!

15:38.771 --> 15:41.149
I'll show you!
I'm not afraid of anything!

15:41.232 --> 15:44.193
I... I...
I will fight Bular.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.154
I will end him today!

15:46.237 --> 15:47.488
-[cheering]
-Jim!

15:47.572 --> 15:48.990
That went poorly.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.702
Fortunately, Jim has no means
by which he can locate Bular.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.370
That's not exactly true.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.914
NotEnrique!
Have you seen Jim?

15:57.707 --> 15:58.958
Hey!
Get away!

15:59.041 --> 16:00.209
You're gonna blow me cover!

16:00.293 --> 16:02.670
Come on! Did you tell Jim
where Bular's hiding?

16:02.753 --> 16:07.091
If a bloke wants to commit suicide,
who am I to stand in his way?

16:07.175 --> 16:08.384
Where did he go?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.927
I can't hear you.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.346
I've got stinky sweat socks.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.806
Haven't been washed all week.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.224
Give me, give me, give me!

16:15.308 --> 16:16.976
Now, tell me where Jim is!

16:22.231 --> 16:26.068
[chuckling]
I'm not afraid of you, Bular.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.653
NotEnrique said we'd find him
in the sewers.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.655
I'll scout from above
while you and Aaarrrgghh search below.

16:29.739 --> 16:30.823
Good idea.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.037
Jim, where are you?

16:36.871 --> 16:38.664
Hey, Bular!

16:41.334 --> 16:42.793
Yo, Bular!

16:45.046 --> 16:46.964
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you better scurry.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.343
-Bular!
-[growling]

16:50.426 --> 16:55.306

16:59.101 --> 17:00.102
Jim?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.103
Bular!

17:01.187 --> 17:02.480
Master Jim.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.273
Master Jim!
Master Jim!

17:05.358 --> 17:07.193
-Where are you?
-Bular!

17:07.276 --> 17:10.695
It is I, the Trollhunter!

17:10.780 --> 17:14.200
Your nemesis challenges you!

17:14.282 --> 17:15.409
[Toby]
Jim?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.743
Jim!

17:16.827 --> 17:19.288
[overlapping chatter]

17:19.372 --> 17:21.582
Jim! Jim!

17:27.880 --> 17:28.756
A-ha!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.261
Bular.

17:33.344 --> 17:37.223
-[muttering]
-[chuckling]

17:37.306 --> 17:40.059
There you are, you ugly Troll!

17:40.142 --> 17:43.479
Let's see how tough you are
without cars to throw at people, shall we?

17:45.523 --> 17:46.983
I saw the Bridge.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.111
I know what you and your pals are up to.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.197
But it ends tonight, baby!

17:53.281 --> 17:55.199
A Grit-Shaka!
[chuckling]

17:55.283 --> 17:59.078
Now I understand why you are
so quick to race to your death.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.788
Excuse you!

18:00.871 --> 18:02.915
I'm not racing anywhere.

18:02.999 --> 18:07.795
And the only "death" tonight
is gonna be your pride!

18:07.878 --> 18:08.879

19:01.474 --> 19:02.558
Good.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.269
The fear will tenderize your flesh.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.064
You'll taste...
Mmm...

-[Toby] Jim!

What's going on?

19:12.777 --> 19:14.236

You can do it!

19:48.312 --> 19:50.189
[groaning]

19:50.272 --> 19:51.315
I can't reach!

19:51.399 --> 19:53.275
The armor!
It's too heavy, Tobes!

19:53.359 --> 19:57.822
Pathetic that you meet your end
in a sewer, Young Atlas.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.450
Atlas too carried the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.285
Watch yourself, Young Atlas.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.538

Now!

20:42.116 --> 20:43.701
I lost the Grit-Shaka.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.621
But I can still be brave.

Also, you've been a real turd today.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.068
And I smell like one, too.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.779
[sighing]

21:19.862 --> 21:21.822
Thanks for saving my neck.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.282
I owe you one.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.700
Yeah, great.

Just don't ever say "crispy" again.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.870
Deal.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.499
-[car honking]
-[woman] Hey! Move it!

21:31.582 --> 21:33.501
[panting]

21:33.584 --> 21:35.544
[growling]

21:35.628 --> 21:37.171
[chuckling]

21:37.254 --> 21:38.589
You did what?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.925
I called him Young Atlas.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.260
But I call him that.
Me, alone!

21:43.344 --> 21:45.554
You should have seen his face.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.723
He'll know I'm working with you.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.475
He'll know I'm a Changeling.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.353
Of all the idiotic things you've done,
you imbecile...

21:52.436 --> 21:55.314
[Gunmar]
I gave the order.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.400
Call it a test.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.904
Oh, a t-- A test?

22:01.987 --> 22:04.448
To lead him to you.

22:04.532 --> 22:09.662
So that when the time comes,
you will kill the boy...

22:09.745 --> 22:12.748
<i>and free me with his Amulet.</i>
