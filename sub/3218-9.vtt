00:02.245 --> 00:03.490
Dad's gone now.

00:03.663 --> 00:05.455
He wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:05.624 --> 00:08.077
What do you say we kill some
evil sons of bitches and raise hell?

00:10.753 --> 00:12.995
That knife.
What kind of blade can kill a demon?

00:13.172 --> 00:15.459
Yesterday, I'd have said
there was no such thing.

00:17.008 --> 00:18.716
Won't stop a demon,
if that's what you think.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.462
Who are you?

00:23.181 --> 00:24.211
That smarts a little.

00:24.389 --> 00:26.963
- What do you want?
- Want me to help you out or not?

00:28.018 --> 00:31.517
The second you find out this Ruby
is a demon, you go for the holy water.

00:31.688 --> 00:33.644
- You don't chat.
- No one was chatting.

00:33.814 --> 00:36.899
- Why didn't you send her to hell?
- She told me she could help you.

00:37.068 --> 00:38.562
She knows
what your weakness is: Me.

00:38.736 --> 00:39.898
Think something's wrong
with my brother?

00:40.071 --> 00:42.607
No. Demons lie.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.690
Last I checked,
Dean's still going to hell.

00:44.866 --> 00:46.859
Everything in its own time, Sam.

00:47.035 --> 00:50.450
You'll have to do things that
go against that gentle nature of yours.

00:50.621 --> 00:52.993
On the bright side,
I'll be there with you.

00:53.165 --> 00:58.241
That little fallen angel
on your shoulder.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:14.141 --> 01:19.480
That was just a terrible, terrible party.

01:21.565 --> 01:24.980
But there was this one
really beautiful woman there.

01:25.985 --> 01:28.856
- You should've gone home with her.
- I did.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.360
Mm.

01:35.327 --> 01:38.078
- I need a few minutes.
- All right.

01:38.246 --> 01:40.404
There's a bottle of '89 in the fridge.

01:40.581 --> 01:41.660
Good.

02:26.705 --> 02:28.532
Oh, God.

02:38.757 --> 02:40.085
What the...?

02:42.803 --> 02:44.048
Paul?

02:46.264 --> 02:47.342
What is it?

02:47.515 --> 02:49.009
It's my teeth...

02:51.435 --> 02:53.677
- Janet!
- Help me!

03:33.097 --> 03:35.173
She was so scared.

03:36.225 --> 03:39.094
I couldn't do anything to stop it.

03:40.645 --> 03:44.144
And I've talked to the police
and I've talked to the medical examiner.

03:44.315 --> 03:45.430
No one can explain it.

03:45.607 --> 03:48.276
Well, that's why they
put the call in to us, Mr. Dutton.

03:48.610 --> 03:50.686
But the CDC,
that's disease control, right?

03:50.862 --> 03:52.606
What do you think, it's some virus?

03:52.781 --> 03:55.022
We're not ruling out anything yet.

03:55.241 --> 03:58.194
- Mr. Dutton, did Janet have any enemies?
I'm sorry?

03:58.369 --> 04:01.453
- Anyone have a reason to hurt her?
- Wait. What...?

04:01.622 --> 04:04.326
What are you saying?
That somebody poisoned her?

04:04.916 --> 04:08.616
We have to cover every base here.
But, I mean, what kind of poison?

04:08.795 --> 04:11.997
- You think a person could've done this?
Would anyone want to?

04:12.172 --> 04:16.122
What? No. No. There's no one
that could have...

04:19.803 --> 04:21.464
Mr. Dutton?

04:22.014 --> 04:24.054
Uh, everyone loved Janet.

04:29.771 --> 04:31.479
Okay. Thank you very much.

04:31.648 --> 04:34.565
We've got everything we need.
We'll get out of your way now.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.273
Dude seem a little evasive to you?

04:41.448 --> 04:44.283
I don't know. I was under a sink
pulling this out.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.701
Hex bag.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.028
- Oh, gross.
- Yeah.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.829
Bird bones, rabbit's teeth.

04:50.998 --> 04:54.283
This cloth is probably cut
from something Janet Dutton owned.

04:54.793 --> 04:56.251
So we're thinking witch.

04:56.419 --> 04:59.835
Uh, yeah, and not some
New Age Wiccan water dowser either.

05:00.006 --> 05:02.330
This is Old World black magic, Dean.

05:02.508 --> 05:04.631
I mean, warts and all.

05:10.181 --> 05:12.257
- I hate witches.
- Ha.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.509
Always spewing their bodily fluids
everywhere.

05:14.685 --> 05:17.307
- Pretty much.
- It's creepy. It's downright unsanitary.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.480
Yeah. Well, someone definitely had it out
for Janet Dutton.

05:20.649 --> 05:22.725
Yeah, someone who snuck in
and planted the bag.

05:22.901 --> 05:26.270
What are we thinking, looking for
some craggy old Blair Bitch in the woods?

05:26.446 --> 05:29.731
Could be anyone. Neighbor, coworker,
man, woman. That's the problem.

05:29.907 --> 05:32.742
- They're human like everyone else.
- How we gonna find them?

05:32.910 --> 05:34.190
This wasn't random.

05:34.370 --> 05:37.073
Someone in Janet Dutton's life
had an ugly ax to grind.

05:37.247 --> 05:39.239
- Find the motive...
- We find the murderer.

05:39.415 --> 05:40.826
Yeah.

05:58.599 --> 06:00.343
Amanda.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.134
- Hey, Amanda!
- Oh, Elizabeth. Hi.

06:05.313 --> 06:07.638
Sorry. I've got a thousand things
on my mind.

06:07.816 --> 06:09.807
Are you okay, sweetie?

06:10.442 --> 06:11.853
You didn't come to book club.

06:12.027 --> 06:14.862
Yeah. Sorry. I was gonna call.
I just... I got busy. You know?

06:16.907 --> 06:19.942
But I'm fine. Really, I am. Thanks.

07:43.274 --> 07:47.141
This dinner was cooked for you,
Paul Arthur Dutton.

07:49.196 --> 07:51.271
Now you're going to eat it.

08:41.573 --> 08:42.654
Check the car.

08:45.453 --> 08:48.158
- Sam?
- Got it!

09:07.305 --> 09:09.879
- You okay?
- What the hell is happening to me?

09:10.058 --> 09:12.300
Someone murdered your wife.
They're trying to kill you.

09:12.477 --> 09:13.675
That's impossible.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.807
If we hadn't been following you,
you'd be a doornail right now.

09:16.981 --> 09:18.890
- Now, who wants you dead?
- Ugh.

09:19.066 --> 09:21.355
- Come on. Think.
- There's a woman...

09:21.527 --> 09:24.278
- Okay, a woman? Okay.
- An affair. A mistake.

09:24.696 --> 09:27.899
She was unbalanced, blackmailing me.
I put an end to it a week ago.

09:28.074 --> 09:29.901
- What's her name?
- Wha...?

09:30.076 --> 09:33.111
- What could she have to do with...?
- Paul, what is her name?

09:55.682 --> 09:58.172
No. No.

10:00.686 --> 10:01.765
No!

10:40.070 --> 10:41.778
That's a curve ball.

10:41.946 --> 10:43.441
Yeah.

10:58.795 --> 11:01.286
Three per wrist, vertical.

11:01.464 --> 11:03.338
She wasn't fooling around.

11:12.681 --> 11:13.796
Yeah.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.596
Looks like she was working
some heavyweight evil here.

11:16.769 --> 11:18.049
Yup.

11:20.522 --> 11:22.229
Oh, God!

11:24.317 --> 11:26.938
Frigging witches.
Seriously, man, come on.

11:27.528 --> 11:29.567
We know
where she got the rabbit's teeth.

11:29.738 --> 11:32.858
<i>Paul sure knows how to pick them.
It's like Fatal Attraction.</i>

11:33.033 --> 11:34.361
- Yeah.
- Why does a rabbit...

11:34.534 --> 11:36.574
...always gets screwed on the deal?

11:37.162 --> 11:39.035
Poor little guy.

11:39.580 --> 11:43.494
You know what I don't get, Dean? If she
was so bent on revenge, why do this?

11:43.667 --> 11:45.210
Well...

11:45.378 --> 11:48.580
...she got Janet Dutton,
thought she'd finished off Paul.

11:48.755 --> 11:51.625
Decided to cap herself,
make it a spurned lover's hat trick.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.543
Maybe.

11:54.427 --> 11:58.044
This doesn't look like a TV room
of a bright and stable person, you know.

11:58.222 --> 12:00.926
No. But then...

12:06.187 --> 12:08.144
...there's this.

12:10.024 --> 12:12.728
Another hex bag? Come on.

12:17.614 --> 12:20.982
Looks like we got a hit, huh?
Little witch-on-witch violence?

12:21.158 --> 12:22.356
I guess.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.821
I'd like to report a dead body.
309 Mayfair Circle.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.783
My name? Yeah, sure. My name is...

12:32.210 --> 12:34.617
Why are witches ganking each other?

12:34.796 --> 12:38.377
I don't know. But I think maybe
we got a coven on our hands.

12:48.140 --> 12:49.385
All right, all right.

12:49.975 --> 12:51.434
I'm going.

12:51.602 --> 12:54.092
I'm not fooled by your little book club,
by the way.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.263
I know what you get up to
when I'm gone.

12:56.439 --> 12:58.231
It's all dish and gossip.

13:00.610 --> 13:04.108
- Hi, Ron.
- Oh, hello, Elizabeth.

13:04.363 --> 13:06.984
When's the last time anyone
actually brought a book?

13:07.157 --> 13:09.197
Good night, Ron.

13:09.409 --> 13:11.318
All right.

13:14.872 --> 13:16.247
He doesn't know?

13:16.415 --> 13:18.989
- You didn't tell him?
- About Amanda?

13:20.585 --> 13:23.372
I think that's book-club business,
don't you?

13:24.547 --> 13:27.038
- Thank you, Tammi.
- Police just took away her body.

13:27.217 --> 13:30.798
- We're gonna pretend it didn't happen?
We loved Amanda.

13:30.969 --> 13:32.168
It's true.

13:32.346 --> 13:36.841
But we know
that she was a little, well, unstable.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.258
- Also true.
And we have to face it...

13:39.435 --> 13:42.057
...she probably killed Janet Dutton.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.898
People just don't spit out their teeth
all of a sudden.

13:45.941 --> 13:47.186
We have to stop.

13:48.735 --> 13:51.309
We have to stop book club.
This has all gone too far.

13:51.488 --> 13:54.441
Elizabeth, just take a deep breath.

13:54.615 --> 13:56.323
Calm down.

13:56.492 --> 13:58.401
We can't stop.

13:58.577 --> 13:59.656
But people are dying.

13:59.829 --> 14:02.532
Ahh. Amanda killed herself, yes...

14:02.705 --> 14:06.074
...and, yes, she killed Janet.

14:06.251 --> 14:09.287
Awful, awful business, of course.

14:09.462 --> 14:12.379
But that's all over now.

14:12.839 --> 14:16.458
And think about
what book club has gotten us, hmm?

14:16.635 --> 14:19.207
Your husband's promotion.

14:19.387 --> 14:22.222
That little trip to Hawaii that you won.

14:22.848 --> 14:24.640
And what about me?

14:24.809 --> 14:27.678
My home pottery business
is finally taking off.

14:27.852 --> 14:30.426
And you wanna just stop?

14:31.022 --> 14:33.098
Do you wanna stop?

14:35.859 --> 14:38.433
Okay, now, come on.
We don't have much time.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.399
Ron gets back from his fantasy football
in an hour.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.576
<i>Book of Shadows, we kneel before you.</i>

14:53.750 --> 14:57.000
<i>Let us serve your master
as you serve us.</i>

14:57.170 --> 15:00.289
<i>Book of Shadows,
we kneel before you.</i>

15:00.464 --> 15:02.291
<i>Let us serve your master...</i>

15:09.847 --> 15:12.635
You must have a green thumb.
Excuse me?

15:12.809 --> 15:16.012
Getting these herbs
to grow out of season like this.

15:16.187 --> 15:17.929
It's quite impressive.

15:18.105 --> 15:20.263
I'm sorry. I should have
introduced myself first.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.397
I'm, uh, Detective Bachman.

15:22.567 --> 15:24.690
- This is Detective Turner.
- Hi.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.312
We're following up
on Amanda Burns' death.

15:27.488 --> 15:29.813
Going around
talking to her neighbors and stuff.

15:29.990 --> 15:32.778
But didn't she...?
I mean, she killed herself, right?

15:32.952 --> 15:34.113
Maybe. Maybe.

15:34.285 --> 15:36.444
We heard you were friends
with the deceased.

15:36.621 --> 15:38.329
Yeah, I guess so.

15:38.706 --> 15:41.280
Do you have any idea
about her practices?

15:41.543 --> 15:43.949
- I'm sorry. What practices?
Her house was littered...

15:44.128 --> 15:47.378
...with satanic paraphernalia.
- A regular black Sabbath.

15:47.548 --> 15:50.797
No. That...
But she was an Episcopalian.

15:51.759 --> 15:54.879
Well, then we're pretty sure
she was using the wrong Bible.

15:57.139 --> 15:58.799
Elizabeth.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.388
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.268
Uh, Renee, these are detectives.

16:04.437 --> 16:05.813
They say Amanda was...

16:05.981 --> 16:07.723
- She was practicing...
- Sorry, detectives.

16:08.482 --> 16:11.151
You can tell that Elizabeth
is a little upset.

16:12.486 --> 16:13.684
Of course, Miss...?

16:14.071 --> 16:17.984
Mrs. Renee Van Allen.

16:19.742 --> 16:21.616
Would you like me to spell it for you?

16:21.786 --> 16:23.364
I'll get by, thanks.

16:24.746 --> 16:29.076
This Amanda business
has been hard for Liz, for all of us.

16:29.251 --> 16:31.824
Yeah, I mean,
you think you know a person...

16:35.005 --> 16:37.710
Well, I guess we all have secrets,
don't we?

16:40.511 --> 16:42.835
Well, thanks. Um, we'll be in touch.

16:43.304 --> 16:44.882
Have a nice day.

16:45.056 --> 16:46.716
Bye.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.237
I'm already sold
on that Elizabeth chick.

17:04.406 --> 17:06.280
You see that victory garden of hers?

17:06.657 --> 17:09.030
Belladonna, wolf's bane, mandrake.

17:09.743 --> 17:12.414
Not to mention that flinch
when we mentioned the occult.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.069
Well, she's definitely had
a good run lately.

17:15.249 --> 17:19.080
Gone up a few tax brackets,
won almost too many raffles.

17:19.795 --> 17:22.084
The kind of thing black magic
always helps with.

17:22.256 --> 17:23.335
Yeah.

17:23.506 --> 17:25.249
I don't think she's alone either.

17:25.425 --> 17:28.758
Looks like Mrs. Renee Van Allen...

17:28.928 --> 17:32.011
...won every craft contest
she entered in the past three months.

17:32.180 --> 17:35.134
A regular Martha Stewart, huh?
Except for the devil worship.

17:35.433 --> 17:38.802
I'm thinking that was the coven
we met back there, minus one member.

17:38.979 --> 17:41.136
Amanda was clearly going
off the reservation.

17:41.313 --> 17:43.140
Think they killed her
to keep up appearances?

17:43.607 --> 17:46.442
- Seems like an appearance kind of crowd.
- Yeah.

17:46.610 --> 17:49.444
If they killed a nutjob,
should we, uh, thank them or what?

17:49.988 --> 17:53.606
They're working black magic too, Dean.
They need to be stopped.

17:54.284 --> 17:55.659
Stopped like "stopped"?

17:57.536 --> 17:59.861
- They're humans, Sam.
- They're murderers.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.371
Burn, witch, burn.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.328
The hell?

18:21.975 --> 18:24.844
- Ruby?
- Sam, listen to me, there's no time.

18:25.018 --> 18:27.225
- What are you talking about?
- Get out of town.

18:27.688 --> 18:29.396
So this is Ruby, huh?

18:30.149 --> 18:31.606
- Never had the pleasure.
- Dean.

18:31.774 --> 18:34.479
- Was hoping you'd show up again.
- Point that thing somewhere else.

18:34.652 --> 18:38.602
- Ha-ha-ha. Right.
- Sam, please. Go.

18:38.781 --> 18:40.405
Get in the car. Don't look back.

18:40.574 --> 18:42.899
- Why? I don't understand.
Hey, hot stuff.

18:43.076 --> 18:44.903
We can take care
of a few kitchen witches.

18:45.078 --> 18:49.241
I'm not talking about witches,
you jackass. Witches are whores.

18:49.415 --> 18:51.288
I'm talking about who they serve.

18:54.628 --> 18:56.335
Demons.

18:57.755 --> 19:00.709
- They get their power from demons.
Yeah.

19:00.883 --> 19:02.508
And there's one here. Now.

19:02.969 --> 19:05.637
- What, you mean besides you?
It knows you're in town.

19:05.804 --> 19:07.962
It's gonna come.
It's more than you can handle.

19:08.140 --> 19:10.428
Oh, come on. What is this, huh?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.474
Tell me
you're not listening to this crap.

19:12.644 --> 19:14.968
Put a leash on your brother
if you wanna keep him.

19:15.146 --> 19:17.138
- Dean, look, just chill out.
- No. No.

19:17.314 --> 19:20.232
She's messing with your head.
God knows why. That's who they are.

19:20.401 --> 19:22.689
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Shut up, bitch.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.186
I'm sorry, why are you part
of this conversation?

19:25.363 --> 19:27.984
Maybe because he's my brother,
you black-eyed skank.

19:28.158 --> 19:30.529
Oh, right.
You care about your brother so much.

19:30.701 --> 19:33.026
That's why you're checking out,
leaving him alone?

19:33.203 --> 19:34.828
- Shut up.
Let me save him...

19:34.997 --> 19:36.407
...since you won't be here.

19:36.582 --> 19:38.040
- I said, shut up!
- Dean, no!

19:58.850 --> 20:00.927
What the hell were you thinking?

20:01.103 --> 20:03.012
What? What the hell was I thinking?

20:03.188 --> 20:06.805
She's a demon. Period. All right?
They want us dead, we want them dead.

20:06.983 --> 20:10.815
Funny, I remember that demon chick in
Ohio. Casey? You didn't want her dead.

20:10.987 --> 20:13.477
Well, she wasn't stringing me along
like a fish on a hook.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.529
No one's stringing me along.

20:16.783 --> 20:21.491
Look, I know it's dangerous,
that she is dangerous.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.405
But like it or not, she's useful.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.620
No. We kill her before she kills us.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.119
Kill her with what?

20:27.292 --> 20:30.376
- The gun she fixed for us?
- Whatever works.

20:30.545 --> 20:34.412
Dean, if she wants us dead,
all she has to do is stop saving our lives.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.464
We have to start looking
at the big picture.

20:36.634 --> 20:39.634
Start thinking in strategies
and moves ahead.

20:39.803 --> 20:43.753
It's not so simple.
We're not just hunting anymore.

20:43.932 --> 20:45.212
We're at war.

20:48.352 --> 20:49.811
Are you feeling okay?

20:49.979 --> 20:52.470
Ugh. Why are you always
asking me that?

20:52.648 --> 20:55.352
Because you're taking advice
from a demon, for starters.

20:55.525 --> 20:58.098
You seem less and less worried
about offing people.

20:58.278 --> 20:59.688
It used to eat you up inside.

20:59.862 --> 21:01.238
What has that gotten me?

21:01.823 --> 21:03.814
Nothing.
It's what you're supposed to do.

21:03.991 --> 21:07.442
We're supposed to drive in the
frigging car and argue about this stuff.

21:07.619 --> 21:09.528
You go on about the sanctity of life.

21:09.871 --> 21:13.239
Wait. So you're mad
because I'm starting to agree with you?

21:14.709 --> 21:17.745
No, I'm not mad. I'm...

21:18.045 --> 21:21.330
I'm worried, Sam,
because you're not acting like yourself.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.424
Yeah. You're right. I'm not.

21:23.591 --> 21:24.836
I don't have a choice.

21:25.135 --> 21:26.593
What is that supposed to mean?

21:27.429 --> 21:29.753
Look, Dean, you're leaving, right?

21:30.681 --> 21:34.381
And I gotta stay here
in this craphole of a world.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.102
Alone.

21:36.602 --> 21:38.180
So the way I see it...

21:38.354 --> 21:41.225
...if I'm gonna make it,
fight this war after you're gone...

21:41.399 --> 21:43.890
...then I gotta change.
- Change into what?

21:45.110 --> 21:46.937
Into you.

21:48.738 --> 21:50.316
I gotta be more like you.

21:57.079 --> 21:59.914
- What's going on with you?
- I don't know.

22:01.083 --> 22:04.118
- Ow! Sam, something's wrong.
- What?

22:04.293 --> 22:05.752
Bunch of knives inside of me.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.414
- Dean?
- Son of a bitch.

22:07.588 --> 22:08.869
- Dean.
- Unh.

22:10.549 --> 22:14.297
The coven, man.
It's gotta be the coven. Unh.

22:14.469 --> 22:16.462
Okay, don't worry.

22:39.241 --> 22:40.901
Dean, I can't find it.

22:42.619 --> 22:44.326
No.

22:50.251 --> 22:52.208
Sam, what are you doing?

22:52.627 --> 22:53.790
Sam.

22:54.170 --> 22:57.006
Sam! Unh!

23:14.564 --> 23:17.565
Oh, my God!
TAMMl: Aah! Aah!

23:17.732 --> 23:20.769
- Let him go.
- Let who go? What are you doing?

23:20.944 --> 23:22.937
- You're insane.
- Lf you know about me...

23:23.113 --> 23:26.113
...then you know about this gun.
You're killing my brother.

23:26.282 --> 23:28.405
Let him go. Get away from the altar.

23:28.576 --> 23:30.319
- What?
- Now!

23:39.002 --> 23:40.626
You wanna kill me?

23:40.795 --> 23:42.539
Get in line, bitch.

23:57.226 --> 24:00.392
Stop calling me bitch.

24:00.562 --> 24:02.056
Go.

24:05.316 --> 24:09.479
- What? We weren't hurting anyone.
- We don't even know your brother.

24:09.653 --> 24:11.942
Stop the spell. Or die.

24:13.323 --> 24:14.866
- Five seconds.
- What?

24:16.577 --> 24:18.734
- Four.
- No, please. Please don't kill us.

24:18.911 --> 24:21.237
We were just getting Renee
a lower mortgage rate.

24:24.625 --> 24:28.408
Next time you point that gun at me,
I'm not gonna disappear. Understand?

24:31.548 --> 24:33.172
You saved my life.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.538
Don't mention it.

24:34.925 --> 24:37.048
What was that stuff?

24:37.678 --> 24:39.552
God, it was ass.

24:39.722 --> 24:41.761
It tasted like ass.

24:42.390 --> 24:44.963
It's called witchcraft, short bus.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.721
You're the short bus, short bus.

24:51.898 --> 24:54.734
Okay. Maybe it's not you.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.358
Or you.

25:03.075 --> 25:04.190
Maybe it's you.

25:05.661 --> 25:08.614
I don't know what he's talking about.
What are you talking about?

25:08.788 --> 25:12.620
All of you, everyone in your little coven,
you've all had runs of good fortune.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.168
Newsworthy good fortune.

25:14.335 --> 25:15.663
Except for you, Tammi.

25:17.337 --> 25:20.089
Why is that?
You didn't want anything for yourself?

25:20.257 --> 25:22.713
Or is it because you're getting
what you wanted?

25:22.885 --> 25:25.457
Like these women's souls.

25:25.845 --> 25:29.048
I can't. I'm not... I told you.

25:37.439 --> 25:40.190
Nice dick work, Magnum.

25:40.692 --> 25:44.819
Let my brother go.

25:44.987 --> 25:47.656
What's wrong?
Couldn't find my hex bag?

25:48.532 --> 25:49.859
Sorry, sweetheart...

25:50.033 --> 25:53.318
...but your brother's lungs
should be on the floor by now.

26:03.211 --> 26:04.955
You're in a lot of trouble, Sam.

26:19.850 --> 26:22.258
Tammi, what's wrong with your eyes?

26:22.436 --> 26:24.428
Tammi, what are you doing?

26:25.021 --> 26:26.930
Renee, shut your painted hole.

26:27.774 --> 26:29.398
What?

26:29.776 --> 26:32.064
I will... You can't...

26:32.236 --> 26:34.359
Not in my house, Tammi Benton.

26:38.492 --> 26:40.649
Look, you got me.

26:41.035 --> 26:43.241
- Let the girl go.
- Wait your turn, young man.

26:45.623 --> 26:46.821
Oh, my God.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.867
Shh. Lizzie.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.036
It's okay.

26:52.671 --> 26:53.916
You're not Tammi.

26:54.089 --> 26:56.876
No, but I'm wearing her meat.

26:57.424 --> 27:00.342
I had to break the ice with you girls
somehow.

27:00.803 --> 27:02.048
You killed Renee.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.798
Renee, Amanda.

27:05.974 --> 27:09.389
That's what happens to witches
who get voted off the island.

27:09.978 --> 27:12.017
- Who are you?
- Ha.

27:12.188 --> 27:14.393
Funny story, actually.

27:14.564 --> 27:17.649
Remember all those dark,
demonic forces you prayed to...

27:18.235 --> 27:20.986
...when you swore your servitude?

27:21.154 --> 27:23.193
Just who did you think
you were praying to?

27:23.364 --> 27:25.985
This... This isn't... It can't be.

27:26.158 --> 27:29.610
Oh. What did you think it was?
Make-believe?

27:29.787 --> 27:31.410
Positive thinking?

27:31.579 --> 27:32.742
<i>The Secret?</i>

27:33.123 --> 27:35.495
No. It was me.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.039
You sold yourself to me, you pig.

27:40.546 --> 27:43.333
All I had to do was bring one good book
to book club...

27:43.507 --> 27:45.998
...and you ladies lined up
to kiss my ass.

27:46.176 --> 27:48.927
No. No. We didn't know.

27:49.345 --> 27:53.806
Oh, yes, you did.
You knew every step of the way...

27:54.141 --> 27:57.426
...and now your ever-living souls
are mine.

27:58.186 --> 28:00.262
Comments? Questions?

28:02.107 --> 28:03.731
Mm.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.105
Sammy Winchester, wow.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.274
Right here in our little town.

28:09.446 --> 28:13.657
You know, my friends and I,
we've been looking for you.

28:14.325 --> 28:18.572
Why? Oh, right, because I'm supposed
to lead some piss-poor demon army.

28:18.746 --> 28:20.240
No, not at all.

28:20.415 --> 28:22.121
You're not our messiah.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.082
We don't believe in you.

28:24.751 --> 28:28.120
But there's a new leader rising
in the West.

28:28.296 --> 28:30.668
A real leader.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.631
That's the horse to bet on, Sam.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.548
The one who's gonna tear
this world apart.

28:37.054 --> 28:39.509
Thing is, this demon...

28:39.681 --> 28:41.673
...doesn't like you very much.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.387
Doesn't want the competition.

28:51.817 --> 28:52.979
Nothing personal.

28:53.443 --> 28:55.649
It's a PR thing.

28:56.112 --> 28:57.985
So bye-bye.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.296
Two for one. Lovely.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.921
Wait.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.807
Please.

29:29.975 --> 29:31.137
I just...

29:32.269 --> 29:33.893
...came to talk.

29:34.062 --> 29:36.185
You made it out of the Gate.

29:36.356 --> 29:39.806
Impressive.
It was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?

29:39.984 --> 29:41.941
Doors out of hell
only open for so long.

29:42.111 --> 29:43.439
What do you want, Ruby?

29:44.780 --> 29:46.653
I've been lost without you.

29:47.574 --> 29:49.696
Take me back.

29:50.410 --> 29:52.449
That's why
I led the Winchesters here.

29:56.623 --> 29:58.746
<i>- I told you so.
They're for you.</i>

29:58.917 --> 30:00.826
As a gift.

30:01.003 --> 30:02.662
Really?

30:03.337 --> 30:05.745
Let me serve you again.

30:06.298 --> 30:08.256
I've wanted it.

30:08.592 --> 30:10.252
I've wanted you...

30:10.428 --> 30:12.550
...for so long.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.090
You were one of my best.

30:24.022 --> 30:27.059
But then again,
you always were a lying whore.

31:07.894 --> 31:11.725
You're really telling me you threw in your
chips with Abbott and Costello here?

31:22.198 --> 31:24.274
Come on. Get up.

31:26.744 --> 31:29.234
I said, get up.

31:37.378 --> 31:39.916
We've been here before, haven't we?

31:40.464 --> 31:41.496
Hmm.

31:44.009 --> 31:46.215
She didn't tell you?

31:46.803 --> 31:48.214
Pretty mortifying, I guess.

31:49.055 --> 31:50.964
She was one of mine.

31:51.308 --> 31:55.007
I turned her out a long, long time ago.

31:55.519 --> 31:57.642
Ruby, here, was a witch.

31:58.188 --> 32:00.725
Of course that was
when you were human.

32:05.987 --> 32:08.608
Oh, didn't want your friends
to know...

32:08.781 --> 32:12.398
...that all those centuries back
you sold yourself to me?

32:12.576 --> 32:15.660
Embarrassing, I guess.

32:15.829 --> 32:17.157
But don't worry, love.

32:17.330 --> 32:19.322
No secrets where you're heading,
remember?

33:55.541 --> 33:57.035
Go.

33:59.502 --> 34:01.874
I'll clean up this mess.

34:05.133 --> 34:06.711
Come on.

34:11.597 --> 34:13.257
Go.

35:17.629 --> 35:21.461
So the devil may care after all.
Is that what I'm supposed to believe?

35:23.259 --> 35:24.800
I don't believe in the devil.

35:25.928 --> 35:27.256
Wacky night.

35:29.515 --> 35:31.721
So let me get this straight.

35:31.933 --> 35:35.717
You were human once. You died,
you went to hell, and became...

35:36.103 --> 35:37.895
Yeah.

35:40.690 --> 35:42.599
How long ago?

35:43.234 --> 35:45.607
Back when the plague was big.

35:46.321 --> 35:49.938
So all of them, every damn demon...

35:50.449 --> 35:51.777
...they were all human once?

35:55.704 --> 35:57.447
Every one I've ever met.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.283
Well, they sure don't act like it.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.783
Most of them have forgotten
what it means.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.167
Or even that they were.

36:05.588 --> 36:07.793
That's what happens
when you go to hell, Dean.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.082
That's what hell is.

36:11.259 --> 36:13.299
Forgetting what you are.

36:14.595 --> 36:17.133
A philosophy lesson from a demon.
I'll pass, thanks.

36:17.306 --> 36:19.263
It's not philosophy.

36:19.433 --> 36:21.473
It's not a metaphor.

36:21.644 --> 36:24.050
There's a real fire in the pit...

36:24.229 --> 36:26.186
...agonies you can't even imagine.

36:26.564 --> 36:28.687
<i>No, I saw Hellraiser. I get the gist.</i>

36:30.193 --> 36:34.236
Actually, they got that pretty close.
Except for all the custom leather.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.244
The answer is yes, by the way.

36:44.664 --> 36:48.494
- Sorry?
- Yes, the same thing will happen to you.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.668
Might take centuries...

36:51.836 --> 36:55.419
...but sooner or later,
hell will burn away your humanity.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.916
Every hell-bound soul...

36:59.093 --> 37:02.462
...every one
turns into something else.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.180
Turns you into us.

37:04.348 --> 37:07.217
So, yeah.
Yeah, you can count on it.

37:14.064 --> 37:16.555
There's no way of saving me
from the pit, is there?

37:19.152 --> 37:20.812
No.

37:24.949 --> 37:27.440
Why did you tell Sam that you could?

37:28.160 --> 37:29.619
So he would talk to me.

37:30.870 --> 37:35.199
You Winchesters can be pretty bigoted.
I needed something to help him get past...

37:35.375 --> 37:36.573
The demon thing?

37:39.294 --> 37:40.788
It's pretty hard to get past.

37:44.049 --> 37:46.088
Look at you...

37:46.510 --> 37:48.585
...trying to be all stoic.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.346
My God, it's heartbreaking.

37:51.764 --> 37:54.136
Why are you telling me all this?

37:54.850 --> 37:56.641
- I need your help.
- Help with what?

37:56.810 --> 37:58.518
With Sam.

37:59.813 --> 38:02.304
The way you
stuck that demon tonight...

38:02.607 --> 38:04.065
...that was pretty tough.

38:04.608 --> 38:07.775
Sam's almost there but not quite.

38:07.945 --> 38:09.902
You need to help me get him ready...

38:11.031 --> 38:12.608
...for life without you...

38:12.782 --> 38:16.115
...to fight this war on his own.

38:20.789 --> 38:22.413
Ruby.

38:24.876 --> 38:27.118
Why do you want us to win?

38:31.632 --> 38:33.838
Isn't it obvious?

38:35.386 --> 38:36.465
I'm not like them.

38:38.137 --> 38:39.929
I don't know why. L...

38:40.098 --> 38:43.383
I wish I was, but I'm not.

38:44.686 --> 38:46.227
I remember what it's like.

38:46.853 --> 38:48.016
What what's like?

38:49.940 --> 38:51.767
Being human.
