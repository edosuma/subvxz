00:06.000 --> 00:08.840
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
Are you OK?

00:45.440 --> 00:47.000
-Are you OK?
-My briefcase.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.520
Help me! I need my briefcase!

00:51.600 --> 00:53.520
-Help me!
-Sir!

01:04.840 --> 01:05.680
It's all good!

01:07.680 --> 01:08.760
He let go of it.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.520
Thank you so much.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.680
-Make sure nothing's missing.
-Yes.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.320
It's all here. Thank you, truly.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.360
You're welcome.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.440
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day, Lucas.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.320
You're taking huge risks by doing this.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.200
You're aware

01:46.040 --> 01:48.480
that this could cost you your career?

01:49.360 --> 01:51.160
Might not be such a bad thing.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.800
Phones aren't allowed.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.440
-Just in case Albert calls me back.
-Albert?

01:57.440 --> 01:58.280
Fontan.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.440
The Interior Minister. He's a friend.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.680
Mr. Pellegrini…

02:07.440 --> 02:10.320
You are in custody for fraud and perjury.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.560
Answer our questions.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.360
So, the insurance contract
for the necklace?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.440
You should talk if you know something.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.560
I don't.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.680
I have done nothing wrong.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.960
After the necklace was stolen in 1995,

02:30.040 --> 02:33.160
you received 118 million francs
in insurance.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.960
You'd intended to sell it
for three times that.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.000
-A lot of money.
-So what?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.280
I don't decide the art market prices.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.920
Besides, I gave the insurance money back.

02:48.080 --> 02:48.920
This man.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
Do you know him?

02:50.680 --> 02:51.640
Of course I do.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.880
He stole the necklace,
just like his father back then. Diop.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.400
Is Diop his real name?

03:01.720 --> 03:03.280
His name is Assane Diop.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.400
We arrested him in Normandy.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.760
He managed to escape.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.760
What about him? Do you know him?

03:21.080 --> 03:24.120
It's a simple question. Do you know him?

03:24.200 --> 03:26.120
I'm thinking. Is that allowed?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.360
I meet many people.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.880
He was arrested with a firearm.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.080
Purchased under a fake name,

03:35.160 --> 03:37.520
with an address in Paris, near Pigalle.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.960
We discovered that you own that apartment.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.760
So? I own many properties across Paris.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.320
I don't know my tenants' names.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.840
He used a fake name. Do you know why?

03:48.920 --> 03:49.760
Ask him.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.600
We will.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.320
We believe he tried
to kidnap Diop's son in Normandy.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.400
Who is this guy?

04:03.480 --> 04:05.160
How long have you known him?

04:05.240 --> 04:07.400
You should answer our questions.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.480
Otherwise, you'll be in hot water.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.480
Yes, hello?

04:18.560 --> 04:20.240
Nice of you to call me back.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.480
Yes.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.640
I'll put him on.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.120
The Interior Minister wants to talk
to you.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.640
Yes? Hello, Mr. Minister.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.000
He says we don't have enough
to keep Pellegrini in custody.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.400
-We have to let him go.
-That's an abuse of power.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.640
At least we have the name
of the guy we've been looking for.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.200
Assane Diop.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.000
-Are you OK?
-My father's been released.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.400
That was predictable.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.160
He knows people.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.600
-What did you make me do?
-Calm down.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.160
It'll be OK.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.960
He'll find whoever talked to the police.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.880
And that wasn't you.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.760
The cop your mother spoke to
is a good guy. He won't talk.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.080
My father always gets what he wants.
Even from good guys.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.720
-I have to cancel the concert.
-No.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.720
You can't.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.600
I can't damage the foundation.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.000
-If you cancel, he'll get suspicious.
-I'm sure he knows.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.560
Juliette…

06:01.920 --> 06:04.280
It will allow you to raise a lot of money

06:05.280 --> 06:07.680
for the foundation and these kids' future.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.080
Don't abandon them.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.880
You can't let them down now.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.400
If you do, your father wins.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.560
-You're a good girl, Juliette.
-Yeah…

06:18.640 --> 06:19.480
Yes.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.720
-Sorry, I have to take this.
-Go ahead.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.240
Hey.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.600
It'll be OK. All right?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.080
-Yes.
-See you later.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.760
Fabienne Bériot was buried in Lille.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.120
I called the morgue. I said
that I wanted to pay for the funeral…

06:48.880 --> 06:52.280
-Someone had already taken care of it.
-Sure, it's not free.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.800
She didn't have any friends.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.520
I asked for the person's coordinates,
in order to thank them.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.360
-They gave me his name.
-Diop.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.880
No. B.T.A. Férel.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.040
A company based in Saint-Ouen.
An antique dealer.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.440
Benjamin Ferel.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.960
He specializes in gemstones.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.800
Good work.
Proof that Diop isn't working alone.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.200
He's probably sent the police after me.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.240
-I--
-Put him under surveillance.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.080
If he knows Diop, he'll lead us to him.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.480
-Let's do that.
-I'll set it up.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.640
No. Leonard will handle it.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.200
Diop is his case.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.320
Give him the details.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.520
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.400
Pascal.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.800
He has a lot to be forgiven for.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.240
This is a golden opportunity for us.

07:53.000 --> 07:53.840
How so?

07:55.360 --> 07:56.360
Shut the door.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.320
-Hello?
-I need you. It's urgent.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.120
-Why?
-I can't do it anymore.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.960
He barks
every time someone says "Pellegrini."

08:09.040 --> 08:11.120
-He's at it again.
-Stop saying his name.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.840
I tried. He figured it out.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.280
The other day,
all I did was think of Pellegrini.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.960
He barked.
He can read my mind.

08:21.040 --> 08:21.960
He's scaring me.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.400
I'll take him back. Meet me at my place.

08:25.080 --> 08:25.920
Thanks.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.040
I'm taking you back to your dad. Come on.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.280
You and Assane have a child.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.240
-Raoul. Is that right?
-Yes.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.520
-So, you know where he lives.
-No.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.360
You don't know where he lives?

08:58.200 --> 08:59.320
Listen…

08:59.400 --> 09:02.360
Assane is a rather discreet person,
you might say.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.880
You see him regularly?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.360
"Regularly" isn't part of his vocabulary.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.640
You're going to wipe that smirk
off your face.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.040
This is a police station.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.520
We're not playing around.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.840
-Who were the guys outside your building?
-Guys?

09:20.920 --> 09:24.000
Waiting for your son.
They made me take him to the Hyatt hotel.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.520
What did they look like?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.360
Undercover police officers.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.520
Did you check if they were?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.120
Are you serious? Of course I did.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.880
No one was sent to keep an eye on you.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.320
-Listen…
-Who were they?

09:44.760 --> 09:47.880
Sir, I would really love to help you,
but I…

09:47.960 --> 09:49.560
I have nothing more to say.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.240
These last few days have been hard on me.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.400
I'm just happy to have my son back.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.640
We'll post men outside your place,
in case Assane comes back.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.200
If you want.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.600
He won't be back.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.880
I don't want him to see my son.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.800
Yeah. It's a great place.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.560
Do you want some old Lupin editions?

10:22.640 --> 10:25.040
-I like The Blonde Lady.
-I do too.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.280
-Anything else?
-I don't know…

10:27.360 --> 10:28.520
The Jewish Lamp.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.880
That's a great one.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.280
Awesome confrontation
between Sholmes and Lupin.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.200
Yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:35.920
You all right?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.040
I feel like
your messes are never going to end.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.120
It's getting better.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.720
-It's almost over.
-You always say that.

10:45.800 --> 10:46.680
No.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.680
You speak like your mother.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.880
Is she with you?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.480
No, I'm telling you, Dad.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.920
I have to go. See you.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.840
Love you.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.120
-Come on, J'accuse!
-Go on!

11:19.160 --> 11:20.280
J'accuse!

11:20.880 --> 11:23.480
-He's happy to see me.
-Not as happy as I am.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.600
So, J'accuse?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.120
You two don't get along, is that it?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.880
I said she couldn't cancel.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.840
-The children's future depends on it.
-You made her feel guilty.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.960
No, I mean it.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.520
We shouldn't prevent Juliette
from doing a good thing.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.560
-I'm leaving.
-See you later.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.920
Pellegrini!

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Right. Good luck.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.880
Hello?
There's a fight at 12A, Trudaine Avenue.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.680
Sounds violent. Send someone.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.800
The owner of the place
is called Assane Diop.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.320
Thanks.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.480
Hello?

14:55.080 --> 14:55.920
Yes…

14:57.920 --> 14:58.760
Writing it down.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.240
PASCAL - IT'S DONE

15:14.240 --> 15:15.400
12A TRUDAINE AVENUE

15:16.200 --> 15:17.040
Thanks.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.880
Yes! We have Diop's address.
12A Trudaine Avenue.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.720
Belkacem! What's the address?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.040
Shit! Come on!

15:27.880 --> 15:28.840
It's ready!

15:34.520 --> 15:35.360
J'accuse?

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
Looks like it.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.440
Come on.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.400
Come on! Let's go!

16:23.080 --> 16:25.400
-I'll go in front!
-I'll take the stairs.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.960
Let's return to today's main story.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.360
A man found murdered
in the heart of Paris.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.600
The police are looking…

16:38.720 --> 16:39.560
Claire!

16:39.640 --> 16:41.840
…for witnesses
to find the owner of the flat.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.360
He's the main suspect in this case.
He's suspected of other crimes.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.880
Yes? What?

16:46.960 --> 16:49.520
-Notably, stealing the Queen's necklace.
-Look.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.760
The suspect has been identified.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.760
According to the police,
it is a man named Assane Diop.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.960
An emergency number has been created

16:58.040 --> 17:01.400
for anyone
with information about this fugitive.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.480
Resources are dedicated to
finding this individual.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.000
The most wanted man in France tonight.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.360
Assane, call me back right away.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.000
He's the guy who was arrested
and released.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.720
We were supposed to question him.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.080
Yeah.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.880
Looks like Diop struck first.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.280
Look what I found.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.440
The Louvre pen.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.160
Just look at him.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.800
He's like a kid.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.040
Laugier.

18:06.120 --> 18:06.960
Be right back.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.480
Hey? Stay focused, Guédira.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.960
-Give us the room.
-Yes, sir.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.480
-Shut the door.
-Of course.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.800
-How did we find this?
-We got lucky.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.640
Someone reported a fight.
Probably a neighbor.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.120
He must have hurried off.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.240
Good work, Laugier.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.440
Listen, Laugier. Sensitive case.
I don't want people hearing about it.

18:40.200 --> 18:44.440
I'd like us to restrict access
to the evidence in this case.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.480
Only you and I will have access to it.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.520
-Understood.
-Very well.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.320
Reach out to me once you've secured it.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.320
-I'm not taking the dog back.
-You haven't heard?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.200
-What?
-You need to leave.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.400
They know. Get your things. Go fast.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.240
-Yes?
-Where are you now?

20:03.960 --> 20:06.200
I don't know. I'm walking.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.200
-Are you being followed?
-Don't think so.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.880
They found my flat when they followed you.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.960
So, make sure.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.680
Shit, yes. There's a guy behind me.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.200
I'm not sure.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.880
OK. Don't turn around.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.480
And be discreet. Stay calm.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.240
Don't run. Don't panic.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.120
Is there a bench?

20:35.360 --> 20:37.680
-There's a bus stop.
-Perfect. Go there.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.160
-Are you sitting down?
-Yes.

20:44.840 --> 20:45.680
Is he gone?

20:46.440 --> 20:47.280
No.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.560
-Is he sitting next to you?
-Yes.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.400
-Can he hear what you're saying?
-Yes.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.600
Listen. A guy was killed in my place.
Chances are that guy is the murderer.

21:00.520 --> 21:04.560
He might go after you, but don't worry.
He won't do anything here.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.480
Reassuring.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.080
Is there a bus?

21:10.000 --> 21:10.840
Yes.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.680
Get on it.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.480
-OK.
-He will get up when you do.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.920
-He's going to let you get on first.
-OK.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.720
Hello.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.640
Walk to the back.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.520
Right before the bus leaves
and the doors close,

21:43.400 --> 21:44.240
you get off.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.200
OK.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.240
Now!

21:58.520 --> 22:00.360
All good. I got off.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.400
He's gone.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.320
I know.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.080
Shit!

22:07.440 --> 22:09.000
-What now?
-Now…

22:10.320 --> 22:11.160
We disappear.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.880
SUBWAY

22:22.360 --> 22:25.320
You'll see. It's going to be awesome.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.440
-Enjoy the tour. Bye.
-Bye.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.080
-Hello. So…
-Two student tickets.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.680
-Shouldn't you be at school?
-No…

22:44.160 --> 22:46.880
It's for our history presentation
about the catacombs.

22:48.040 --> 22:48.880
Sure.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.880
OK. So, you need a map.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.320
So many tunnels.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.960
-The ones the public has access to.
-There are more?

22:58.040 --> 22:59.000
Let me show you.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.240
A cataphile drew this a few years ago.

23:03.320 --> 23:07.240
These are the tunnels on your map
that everyone has access to.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.080
And these are other tunnels,

23:09.160 --> 23:11.000
which this specialist mapped out.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.320
They have never been visited
because it's dangerous.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.920
Can we borrow it?

23:18.400 --> 23:20.720
OK. But you bring it back. Promise?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.000
Of course, madam.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Don't go in there. It's dangerous.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.040
-No, don't worry.
-Of course.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.080
-Right. Enjoy the tour.
-Thanks.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.360
-Good day.
-Good day.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.320
Bring it back, OK?

23:32.880 --> 23:34.000
Hello.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.640
Two tickets?

23:45.560 --> 23:48.600
MURDER AND ROBBERY IN FRANCE
PORTRAIT OF A PUBLIC ENEMY

23:48.680 --> 23:50.360
THIEF, MURDERER, MASTER OF ESCAPE

23:53.400 --> 23:54.520
What's up with you?

23:55.920 --> 23:56.800
ELUSIVE

23:58.760 --> 24:02.720
You spent your time trying to tell us
that Diop was the new Lupin.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.640
Now that we agree with you,
you're depressed.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.240
That's the issue.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.480
I don't know if I'm right.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.560
I don't know if this guy's Arsène Lupin.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.880
Of course. It's obvious.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.400
He's obsessed with him.
The books, the costumes.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.760
Commits the same crimes.
Just missing the top hat, the monocle.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.200
You know about Lupin now?

24:32.080 --> 24:34.720
Seriously. You were right from the start.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.560
If you were an expert,
you'd know the issue.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.520
-The guy we're looking for can't be Lupin.
-Why?

24:43.920 --> 24:44.880
Lupin doesn't kill.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.880
He's a gentleman burglar.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.680
That's in the books, Guédira.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.000
Lupin may not be a murderer, but Diop…

24:53.720 --> 24:54.760
Well, Diop is.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.240
Finally,
the manhunt for Assane Diop is ongoing.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.320
-There's no trace of the fugitive.
-I don't know.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.680
The man, described as cunning,
continues to evade the police.

25:05.760 --> 25:10.240
The drama surrounding the manhunt
of Assane Diop has France on pins.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.400
Investigators are hoping
to resolve this within days.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.120
Sorry.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.440
If someone finds us here…

25:30.680 --> 25:33.480
Where did you find that phone?
Did you steal it?

25:34.080 --> 25:36.560
Playing with fire.
You don't even know the PIN.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.080
The guy was around 50…

25:38.160 --> 25:41.120
So, that would be 1970… 1971…

25:41.200 --> 25:44.720
Or 1969…

25:44.800 --> 25:48.080
-There. Look.
-Are you serious? I can't believe this…

25:48.800 --> 25:50.640
We were due some good luck.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.080
B.T.A FÉREL, ANTIQUE DEALER
DIOP'S ACCOMPLICE

26:27.640 --> 26:29.720
We're looking for his phone number.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.760
Checking his bank account,
online transactions.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.360
-Whatever helps locate him.
-Laugier.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.320
Good. Keep it up.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.600
-Is the evidence in a secure place?
-Yes.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.120
Perfect. I have some information for you.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.320
A shop at the flea market.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.320
We think Diop was fencing goods there.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
OK. I'm on it.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.480
We need to check an address.
Belkacem, with me.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.120
-Guédira, you stay.
-What?

26:57.200 --> 26:59.240
-I need you here.
-But…

27:02.480 --> 27:05.280
-He's Diop's accomplice.
-Where is he?

27:05.360 --> 27:07.520
He must have left a clue somewhere.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.280
Get this to the lab.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.640
-OK.
-Thanks.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.560
Old sneakers, a hair dryer,
there's nothing here, dammit!

27:22.280 --> 27:23.840
I think I found something.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.040
Over here.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.720
There's a code. Figure it out.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.640
Come on!

27:42.360 --> 27:45.320
ASSANE DIOP:
THIEF, MURDERER AND MASTER OF ESCAPE

27:51.760 --> 27:54.360
-What are you doing?
-Commenting on the news.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.920
Stop it! We need to get out of Paris!

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
-I'm wanted for murder.
-Exactly!

27:59.080 --> 28:00.880
Running away means
admitting guilt.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.200
I'm not guilty.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.320
I was framed like my dad.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.880
Our plan for the Châtelet will prove
I'm innocent.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.920
We didn't do all this for nothing.
We're ready.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.040
We'll be safe here until the show.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.640
Even if I tried to convince you,
you'd end up doing whatever you want.

28:19.720 --> 28:20.560
Exactly.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.560
We need to find number 12.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.680
Calm down.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.920
Stop drinking coffee.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.120
It's too much. Makes you nervous.

29:11.720 --> 29:12.800
What do we do?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.120
It's closed.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.680
ARSÈNE LUPIN VERSUS HERLOCK SHOLMES

29:33.640 --> 29:34.480
You all right?

29:36.600 --> 29:38.720
-What are you reading?
-Arsène Lupin.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.880
Dad gave it to me.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.440
Aren't you a little old?

29:43.560 --> 29:44.400
No.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.760
-What's it about?
-Depends on the book.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.040
OK. The one you're reading?

29:49.880 --> 29:50.880
The Blonde Lady.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.880
About an escape.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.640
Police! Nobody move!

30:02.320 --> 30:03.640
Shit, what is this…

30:03.720 --> 30:05.000
Is that it?

30:05.080 --> 30:08.560
Thanks to the blonde lady,
Lupin has the plans to the buildings.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.880
He's one step ahead.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.520
Still warm. They were here not long ago.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.760
Can't believe it.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.640
He escapes
whenever he's about to get caught.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.000
His accomplices too.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.480
No matter where he is…

30:30.040 --> 30:31.400
he always gets away.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.080
Damn. What the hell is this?

30:46.240 --> 30:48.680
Sounds good. I should give it a go.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.120
NEW ARTICLE ABOUT ASSANE DIOP

31:29.200 --> 31:31.400
THIEF, MURDERER AND MASTER OF ESCAPE

31:45.560 --> 31:47.880
ONE MINUTE AGO

32:04.040 --> 32:05.600
What are you telling me?

32:13.880 --> 32:15.440
No. The…

32:15.520 --> 32:17.160
The plam… The…

32:17.760 --> 32:19.480
The lamp.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.920
The lamp.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.960
Je…

32:25.040 --> 32:26.760
The lamp… The Jewish lamp!

32:26.840 --> 32:29.200
THE JEWISH LAMP

32:31.320 --> 32:32.960
The Jewish Lamp.

32:33.040 --> 32:33.880
OK.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.440
Oh, shit.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.560
Hey? Stay focused, Guédira.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.400
Thank you.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.400
What the hell is this?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.160
Boss.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.600
What do we do?

33:46.200 --> 33:47.040
Let's go.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.360
Come on.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.440
Come on, Belkacem.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.120
Come on.

34:12.840 --> 34:13.680
Dammit.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.600
Boss!

34:16.680 --> 34:18.480
I think there's someone there.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.640
…the remains of more than
six million people from the cemeteries.

34:30.720 --> 34:31.920
Police! Nobody move!

34:32.000 --> 34:33.720
OK. Sorry.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.160
Have you seen a tall Black man,

34:36.240 --> 34:37.880
short hair, probably armed?

34:38.720 --> 34:40.360
You mean Assane Diop?

34:41.640 --> 34:44.320
-You get here through Denfert-Rochereau?
-Yes.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.960
We need backup
near the Catacombs in the 14th district.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.200
Call reception. No one comes down.

34:50.840 --> 34:51.680
OK.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.720
Don't let people in anymore.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.920
Assane Diop is reportedly inside.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.160
The Catacombs are now closed.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.520
Move along. We are closed!

35:04.080 --> 35:06.000
The Catacombs are closed.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.760
Go home. Clear the area.
This is an emergency.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.040
-Not there.
-Sure?

35:41.120 --> 35:43.360
-We've been walking a while.
-I'm sure.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.240
-Shit!
-Come on, Belkacem.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.040
I heard them. We gotta move.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.080
They're getting closer.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.320
You recognize it now?

36:18.400 --> 36:20.400
Yeah. Well done.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.720
It's here.

36:46.880 --> 36:47.760
OK.

36:59.760 --> 37:03.040
Go on. Come on.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.400
This is so dope.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.400
It's this way.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.360
-We're going in.
-OK.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.200
-You OK?
-Yeah.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.400
Halfway there.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.840
This way! Come on!

38:42.720 --> 38:44.040
Look where it took us.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.480
Come on. Hurry up.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.320
-Here.
-It might be useful someday.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.720
Let's go.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.280
Ben.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.560
For the blonde lady.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.320
Here, madam. Like we promised.

39:37.960 --> 39:38.960
Thanks again.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.920
What is this thing…

40:11.800 --> 40:12.640
Dammit.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.200
Yes!

40:18.920 --> 40:20.320
To the origin of the world.

40:21.800 --> 40:22.680
Money.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.280
Yes?

40:26.360 --> 40:27.200
Sir?

40:30.640 --> 40:31.920
Dumont.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.480
Can we speak in private?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.760
We're all friends here.

40:40.840 --> 40:41.840
Have a seat.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
Sit down.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.920
So, tell me.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.680
We've gathered Assane Diop's things.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.360
All that could lead back to us
is in a secure location.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.440
-We just have to destroy it.
-Good.

41:07.040 --> 41:07.880
OK.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.480
What is this?

41:20.520 --> 41:21.360
Damn.

41:33.680 --> 41:37.760
And any charges held against you
will be dropped.

41:38.640 --> 41:39.840
Perfect, Dumont.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.160
Absolutely perfect.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.400
You need to remain careful.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.760
My men are asking questions.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.520
I feel they're getting close.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.040
What is this?

42:22.200 --> 42:23.520
Relax, Dumont.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.400
You only need to attend the concert.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.000
Enjoy the moment…

42:32.680 --> 42:34.120
The money is coming.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.920
The beginning of a new life.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.760
No…

42:46.360 --> 42:48.200
You want to write, right?

42:48.880 --> 42:50.360
He wants to write a book.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.040
You can quit your job and get to it.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.800
You deserve it, Dumont.

43:19.120 --> 43:22.680
I really thought
we were going to get caught this time.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.640
Yet here we are. We did it, Ben.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.440
Yeah.

43:30.280 --> 43:34.360
In 1911 the Théâtre du Châtelet featured
the first stage adaptation of Lupin.

43:34.440 --> 43:35.320
Really?

43:38.800 --> 43:40.480
Tomorrow, it'll be our turn.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.280
Our last show.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.520
We'll be done with Pellegrini.
