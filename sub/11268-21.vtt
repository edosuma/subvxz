 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.571 --> 00:06.438
                You know, I keep
             having this feeling

00:06.506 --> 00:08.007
    I'm forgetting something.   

00:08.074 --> 00:10.009
Well, do you have               
the night deposit?              

00:10.076 --> 00:11.343
            Yeah, right here.   

00:11.411 --> 00:14.013
Did you put the extra           
cash in the safe?               

00:14.080 --> 00:15.681
            Yeah. Yeah, yeah.   

00:15.749 --> 00:16.682
     I know.                    

00:16.750 --> 00:17.716
                     What?      

00:17.784 --> 00:19.018
You didn't call the             
beer distributor.               

00:19.085 --> 00:20.686
            No, I asked Woody   
                     to do that.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.554
            Ah, all right. I'll,
                I'll call him   

00:22.622 --> 00:23.689
         in the morning, myself.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.557
             Oh, oh, wait, wait.
             I know what it is. 

00:25.625 --> 00:26.759
              I know what it is.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.932
              Good night, Sammy.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.334

01:50.343 --> 01:52.411
                Interesting     
            little article here.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.447
    It says that the average    
     human being only uses      

01:55.515 --> 01:56.982
    17% of his brain.           

01:58.351 --> 02:00.419
        Boy. You realize        
        what that means?        
                      NORM: Mmm?

02:00.487 --> 02:03.022
We don't use a full, uh...      

02:03.089 --> 02:05.491
              64%.              

02:07.394 --> 02:09.161
Some don't use even more.       

02:10.896 --> 02:12.431
        (laughing)              

02:12.499 --> 02:14.767
         All right. Who let     
        Woody read "Ziggy"?     

02:17.103 --> 02:18.003
     (laughing)                 

02:18.071 --> 02:19.338
                You realize he's
                gonna be useless

02:19.406 --> 02:21.173
        for the next 15 minutes.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.776
    (thuds)                     

02:25.845 --> 02:28.347
    Woody, take your break.     

02:28.415 --> 02:30.482
        (laughing)              

02:30.550 --> 02:32.885
Frasier, for                    
the last time,                  

02:32.952 --> 02:34.887
are you going to accompany      
me and Frederick                

02:34.954 --> 02:37.690
to my great-uncle's             
birthday celebration or not?    

02:37.757 --> 02:40.259
                 Lilith, the man
              is going to be 98.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.894
        He won't know whether   
            I'm there or not.   

02:41.961 --> 02:43.362
             You could introduce
                 him to a chair.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.899
          You'd get the same dim
         flicker of recognition.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.233
Frasier, that is unkind.        

02:48.301 --> 02:50.669
My uncle has all his            
faculties intact.               

02:50.737 --> 02:53.072
        Yes. Which explains     
         why whenever he sees me

02:53.139 --> 02:54.373
        he calls me "Colonel"   

02:54.441 --> 02:57.476
    and breaks into a rousing   
         chorus of "Over There."

02:58.645 --> 03:00.546
All right, you                  
don't have to come.             

03:00.613 --> 03:02.414
Now, while I'm                  
away, I need you                

03:02.482 --> 03:03.749
to water the plants,            

03:03.817 --> 03:05.517
pay the paperboy and            
take the garbage out            

03:05.585 --> 03:07.986
on Tuesday nights. I've         
written it all down for you.    

03:08.054 --> 03:10.155
          Lilith, you don't have
    to treat me like a child.   

03:10.223 --> 03:12.991
Of course not, Frasier.         
Oh. Please remember--           

03:13.059 --> 03:14.593
don't open the door             
to strangers.                   

03:16.062 --> 03:17.663
                    Lilith.     

03:17.731 --> 03:19.331
Well, Frasier, there            
is a precedent set.             

03:19.399 --> 03:22.935
We lost our stereo that day.    

03:23.003 --> 03:24.236
    Well, he <i>looked</i> friendly.   

03:24.304 --> 03:25.771
     He needed to use the phone!

03:25.839 --> 03:27.506
          It was 3:00           
    in the morning, darling.    

03:27.574 --> 03:29.375
            People have flats at
            3:00 in the morning!

03:29.442 --> 03:31.210
He was wearing a ski mask.      

03:33.413 --> 03:35.547
                I won't open the
              door to strangers.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.418
      Oh. One other thing.      

03:39.486 --> 03:41.553
 Mmm, yes. Anything, my angel.  

03:41.621 --> 03:44.189
 Would you stop by the lab and  
  pick up a short-haired rat--  

03:44.257 --> 03:46.325
I.D. number 17-A?               

03:46.393 --> 03:47.326
                Oh, Whiskers.   

03:47.394 --> 03:49.028
Yes. I call him that            

03:49.095 --> 03:51.030
because his whiskers            
are so pronounced.              

03:51.097 --> 03:52.231
Get it?                         

03:52.298 --> 03:55.100
Whiskers-- Whiskers.            

03:56.803 --> 03:59.772
    Humor is all about making   
     those connections, darling.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.077
          Hey, Mayday!          

04:05.145 --> 04:06.345
          Hey, Mitch!           

04:06.413 --> 04:07.379
Heads up!                       

04:07.447 --> 04:08.414
                 Hey, everybody.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.481
     This is Mitch Ganzell.     

04:09.549 --> 04:10.916
                        NORM:   
                            Wow!

04:10.984 --> 04:12.785
        We used to pitch        
      together on the Sox.      

04:12.852 --> 04:14.219
                     Best arm in
                    baseball.   

04:14.287 --> 04:16.321
            Want to touch it?   

04:16.389 --> 04:17.555
(laughs)                        

04:17.624 --> 04:19.224
Good to see you, Sam.           
                 Yeah, you, too.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.259
How long's it been?             

04:20.326 --> 04:22.428
            Oh, I don't know.   
            What? 14, 15 years. 

04:22.495 --> 04:23.595
CARLA:                          
Hey!                            

04:23.663 --> 04:25.631
It's Ganzell! Hey!              
(laughing)                      

04:25.699 --> 04:26.632
    (grunts)                    

04:26.700 --> 04:28.667
Oh, Carla,                      
you still got it!               

04:28.735 --> 04:30.669
             Yeah, and you can  
            still have it.      

04:32.505 --> 04:33.672
              Sit down.         

04:33.740 --> 04:35.207
            What are you        
            doing in town?      

04:35.275 --> 04:37.676
Well, I don't know if you've    
been keeping track of the Sox   

04:37.744 --> 04:40.012
but they're really hurting      
for relief pitchers.            

04:40.080 --> 04:41.680
Yeah, they got <i>nobody.</i>          
                         I know.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.349
So, I'm thinking of             
making a comeback,              

04:43.416 --> 04:45.451
try out for the farm team,      
work my way back up.            

04:45.518 --> 04:47.252
             (laughing):        
         No, really, Ganzell.   

04:47.320 --> 04:48.754
     What is it, family reunion?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.289
I'm serious.                    

04:50.357 --> 04:52.224
Heck, I'm not                   
that old.                       

04:52.292 --> 04:54.360
To be honest with you,          
I really miss the game.         

04:54.427 --> 04:56.228
Anyway, tryouts                 
are tomorrow.                   

04:56.296 --> 04:57.763
I'm goin' for it.               

04:57.831 --> 04:58.797
What do you think, Sam?         

04:58.865 --> 04:59.865
Am I really crazy?              

04:59.933 --> 05:01.200
        No! You're not crazy.   

05:01.267 --> 05:02.568
                 You kiddin' me?
            You're fantastic.   

05:02.635 --> 05:04.303
    If anyone can make          
     a comeback, it's you.      

05:04.371 --> 05:05.304
    You were the best.          

05:05.372 --> 05:06.638
             Excuse me a second.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.608
    Carla, uh... g-get Mitch    
     a drink on the house.      

05:11.011 --> 05:13.579
      Better make it a big      
    glass of reality.           

05:13.646 --> 05:16.982
(laughing)                      

05:17.050 --> 05:18.984
                     Sammy!     

05:19.052 --> 05:20.019
              Sammy, Sammy, Sam?

05:20.086 --> 05:21.954
              I thought you said
            he was the best!    

05:22.022 --> 05:24.289
You kidding me? He sucked.      

05:26.459 --> 05:28.627
      We used to call him       
         <i>"Mrs.</i> Ganzell."        

05:30.063 --> 05:32.131
I was ten times                 
better than he was,             

05:32.198 --> 05:33.399
  and he's making a comeback.   

05:33.466 --> 05:34.667
Can you believe that?           

05:34.734 --> 05:36.568
                Yeah. You're    
                right, Sammy.   

05:36.636 --> 05:38.203
        You should be the one   
            back in baseball.   

05:38.271 --> 05:39.471
  Oh...                         
                    Yes, sir.   

05:39.539 --> 05:41.573
        You should be the one   
    getting back in the game.   

05:41.641 --> 05:42.775
Well, I'm not saying I want to, 

05:42.842 --> 05:44.176
    but I sure as hell          
        could, you know.        

05:44.244 --> 05:45.411
Well, the only                  
reason I got out                

05:45.478 --> 05:46.645
of the game in                  
the first place                 

05:46.713 --> 05:48.013
is I was drinking               
and all that, you know,         

05:48.081 --> 05:49.181
and I'm not                     
doing that anymore.             

05:49.249 --> 05:50.416
  I've still got my arm. Hell,  

05:50.483 --> 05:53.052
    I'm in as good a shape      
    as I was when I was 18.     

05:53.119 --> 05:55.254
                      Same here.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.158
         No, really! I tell you,
                Sammy, I can fit

05:59.225 --> 06:01.760
        in the same clothes I   
        wore in high school.    

06:03.430 --> 06:04.463
             Matter of fact, uh,

06:04.531 --> 06:07.232
            if I'm not mistaken,
            these are them.     

06:07.300 --> 06:08.767
 You know-- wait a second here. 

06:08.835 --> 06:10.402
This is not                     
crazy. You know?                

06:10.470 --> 06:12.738
  I mean, look at Nolan Ryan.   
        He's what-- 45?         

06:12.806 --> 06:14.373
                There you go.   
He's still                      
pitching in the majors.         

06:14.441 --> 06:16.208
If he can do it,                
I can do it.                    
                        Sure.   
              Sure.             

06:16.276 --> 06:17.676
        What do you guys        
    think? Seriously.           

06:17.744 --> 06:20.312
Well, Sammy, uh, we, we'd       
     love for you to do it.     

06:20.380 --> 06:24.883
    I mean... well, it'd        
    give us back our lives.     

06:24.951 --> 06:26.719
What do you... what do you mean?

06:26.786 --> 06:27.953
        Sammy, it's no secret   

06:28.021 --> 06:29.555
            we've been living   
         vicariously through you

06:29.622 --> 06:31.190
                for the past    
                several years   

06:31.257 --> 06:32.658
            and lately, frankly,

06:32.726 --> 06:35.260
                 it's... gotten 
                 kind of boring.

06:36.629 --> 06:37.796
     That bad, huh?             
                        CLIFF:  
                        I mean, 

06:37.864 --> 06:38.897
         we've actually         
         been thinking          

06:38.965 --> 06:40.866
          about living          
vicariously through Phil.       

06:42.469 --> 06:45.204
So I get my socks               
out of the dryer                

06:45.271 --> 06:47.673
and one of them's missing.      

06:47.741 --> 06:50.142
Hey, guys. Whoa, whoa.          
Wait a second. Wait.            

06:50.210 --> 06:51.944
      Wait, wait. I'm back      
    in the game, all right?     

06:52.012 --> 06:52.978
This is all gonna change.       

06:53.046 --> 06:53.946
                        NORM:   
                      All right!
         All right.             

06:54.014 --> 06:54.747
    Yeah?                       
              Hey!              

06:54.814 --> 06:55.681
    All right.                  

06:55.749 --> 06:57.349
         Thanks, guys.          

06:57.417 --> 06:59.218
                 Oh, brother.   
            This is terrific.   

06:59.285 --> 07:00.419
What?                           

07:00.487 --> 07:02.388
                You want to play
                baseball again, 

07:02.455 --> 07:03.922
                 fulfill your   
                 little fantasy.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.457
                 Well, why don't
                 we all do that?

07:05.525 --> 07:09.395
     I mean, why don't I go back
    to my high school prom? Huh?

07:09.462 --> 07:11.563
            Maybe I'd have      
            a <i>pretty</i> dress.     

07:13.066 --> 07:14.933
                Maybe I wouldn't
                weigh 300 pounds

07:15.001 --> 07:17.803
         and be on tetracycline.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.672
                  Sammy. Don't  
                  listen to her.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.540
            You want something, 
          you have to go for it.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.775
                If I didn't     
                  feel that way,

07:22.842 --> 07:24.843
        I'd still be sitting way
        over there by the piano.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.514
     Take it easy, Mayday.      

07:28.581 --> 07:30.382
        Yeah. Hey. Whoa.        
Hold on a sec here, Mitch.      

07:30.450 --> 07:31.583
         Uh, about those tryouts

07:31.651 --> 07:32.618
                    you were    
                  talking about.
         Yeah.                  

07:32.686 --> 07:34.253
                Are they, uh,   
              open for anybody? 

07:34.320 --> 07:35.621
    Oh, sure. Why?              

07:35.689 --> 07:37.423
         Well, you know, hearing
    you talk got me thinking.   

07:37.490 --> 07:38.457
          You know, maybe, uh...

07:38.525 --> 07:39.858
                maybe I got a   
                couple of years 

07:39.926 --> 07:40.859
          left in this arm, huh?

07:40.927 --> 07:41.860
          I mean, what the hell?

07:41.928 --> 07:43.629
                If you can do   
                it, I can do it.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.997
      (laughing)                
      Hey, Sammy,               

07:45.065 --> 07:46.432
there's a little bit            
of difference here.             

07:46.499 --> 07:47.466
I was a good pitcher.           

07:47.534 --> 07:48.434
            Oh, give me a break.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.835
            You stunk it up     
                  out there.    

07:49.903 --> 07:50.969
Oh, like hell I did.            

07:51.037 --> 07:52.638
I was every bit                 
as good as you.                 

07:52.706 --> 07:54.139
                  Oh, give me...
                  Come on, man! 

07:54.207 --> 07:56.675
  On your <i>best</i> days you couldn't
        get it across the plate.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.010
Well, at least I                
could <i>see</i> the plate.            

07:58.078 --> 07:59.178
                Hey, go to hell!

07:59.245 --> 08:00.212
Oh, you go to hell!             

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
                 (mutters)      

08:01.348 --> 08:03.582
        (both laughing)         

08:03.650 --> 08:05.517
          Whee! Gosh! It's great
         to be back in the game.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.519
Listen, if we both make the     
team, let's room together.      

08:07.587 --> 08:09.154
        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!   

08:09.222 --> 08:10.322
                      All right.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.523
                I'll see you.   

08:18.031 --> 08:20.299
            Well, Whiskers,     
            this is Cheers.     

08:22.035 --> 08:23.402
    Cheers, this is Whiskers.   

08:24.637 --> 08:26.872
                  So, uh, Doc...

08:26.940 --> 08:29.742
         living the old carefree
          bachelor life, huh?   

08:29.809 --> 08:31.176
                  (laughs) Yeah.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.644
              Yeah, I betcha    
            with your wife away,

08:32.712 --> 08:34.645
            if you wanted to,   
            you could, uh...    

08:34.714 --> 08:36.648
              do a little, uh...
                swinging, eh?   

08:38.717 --> 08:41.320
Yes. There's nothing young      
women find more attractive      

08:41.388 --> 08:44.890
than a middle-aged man          
with a rat in a cage.           

08:44.958 --> 08:46.325
                I hear you, Doc.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.193
    Yeah.                       

08:49.662 --> 08:52.698
So, uh, has Sam returned        
from his tryout yet?            

08:52.766 --> 08:54.333
                Oh, he should be
            back anytime now.   

08:54.401 --> 08:55.467
I'm telling you guys,           

08:55.535 --> 08:57.703
he's setting himself up         
to be disappointed.             

08:57.771 --> 09:00.639
He's going to walk in here      
feeling like a big loser.       

09:00.707 --> 09:03.609
What makes you think Sam's      
as big a loser as you are?      

09:03.677 --> 09:06.278
    Excuse me, Carla,           
    but I did not say           

09:06.346 --> 09:08.647
    that he was as big          
        a loser as I am.        

09:10.550 --> 09:13.352
I am merely trying to point out 
the fact that he's older,       

09:13.420 --> 09:15.788
     and there are better,      
    faster, younger players.    

09:15.855 --> 09:17.823
Yeah, well I think that         
you're gonna be surprised,      

09:17.891 --> 09:19.058
'cause Sam's gonna              
make this team.                 

09:19.125 --> 09:20.225
            Right, guys?        

09:20.293 --> 09:22.795
              Right, of course--
             he's Mayday Malone.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.763
Yeah, but, uh, hold on there,   
     Normie, what if he doesn't?

09:24.831 --> 09:26.065
Thought about that?             

09:26.132 --> 09:28.133
        A thing like that can   
          really hit a guy hard.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.769
        Yeah, he'll probably,   
         uh, storm back in here,

09:30.837 --> 09:32.271
                go in the office
             and lock himself in

09:32.339 --> 09:34.640
     and, uh, maybe start taking
          inventory of his life,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.208
peruse over                     
the setbacks,                   

09:36.276 --> 09:37.876
            the humiliations,   
                the wrong turns,

09:37.944 --> 09:40.112
            and all the while   
             fashioning his belt

09:40.180 --> 09:41.380
         into a makeshift noose.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.048
          I mean, we've all done
             it a hundred times.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.185
You okay, Cliff?                

09:46.252 --> 09:47.619
                    What are you
                  asking <i>me</i> for?

09:47.687 --> 09:48.787
                Sam's the one   
            with the problem.   

09:50.523 --> 09:52.424
Hello, Miss Howe.               
You know, with, uh,             

09:52.492 --> 09:54.193
          Sam on the road       
         playing pro ball,      

09:54.260 --> 09:55.527
        I guess it's between    
             you and me         

09:55.595 --> 09:56.962
        as to who gets          
          to run the bar.       

09:57.030 --> 09:58.630
             Of course, the only
            experience I have   

09:58.698 --> 10:01.266
is that I've been               
the assistant bartender here    

10:01.334 --> 10:02.968
for the past six years.         

10:03.036 --> 10:06.305
Well, I will let my             
record speak for itself.        

10:06.373 --> 10:08.407
                 Yes!           

10:08.475 --> 10:10.242
                    Hey, wait   
                    a minute.   

10:10.310 --> 10:11.443
                  Wait a minute!

10:11.511 --> 10:12.811
            Carla's been here   
                    the longest.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.313
        If anyone should take   
            over, it's Carla.   

10:14.381 --> 10:15.514
Oh, no, no, no,                 
not me.                         

10:15.582 --> 10:16.648
     I'm the kind of person     

10:16.716 --> 10:18.283
    that doesn't like           
        responsibility.         

10:18.351 --> 10:20.252
     What are you talking about?
        You have eight children.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.588
        Well, I wouldn't        
     if I were responsible.     

10:24.557 --> 10:25.624
Well, I'd love                  
to stick around                 

10:25.692 --> 10:27.092
and see how things              
turned out for Sam,             

10:27.160 --> 10:29.328
but it's time Whiskers          
and I hit the road.             

10:29.396 --> 10:31.497
    Oh, Dr. Crane, before you   
        go, can I see him first?

10:31.564 --> 10:32.498
                    I love rats.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.133
                 We used to have
                a lot of them   

10:34.200 --> 10:35.501
                on the farm back
                     in Hanover.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.902
                Kept the barn   
                free of cats.   

10:39.673 --> 10:43.308
Woody, meet Whiskers.           

10:43.376 --> 10:45.144
Oh, my God, he's gone!          

10:45.211 --> 10:48.147
              Wow, that's a neat
            trick, Dr. Crane.   

10:50.283 --> 10:52.451
         Now do it with a bunny.
No!                             

10:52.519 --> 10:54.586
     Oh, no, Woody, you've      
    got to help me find him!    

10:54.654 --> 10:56.455
      If Lilith comes back      
  and I haven't got Whiskers,   

10:56.523 --> 10:57.690
             I'm dead meat!     

10:57.757 --> 10:59.124
You know, Dr. Crane,            
once, back in Hanover,          

10:59.192 --> 11:00.292
I wanted to catch some rats     

11:00.360 --> 11:01.694
and I started                   
playing a flute                 

11:01.761 --> 11:03.362
and a bunch of them             
followed me out of town.        

11:04.631 --> 11:06.832
And some children, too.         

11:06.900 --> 11:09.268
  Oh, wait, was that a movie?   

11:11.071 --> 11:12.871
      No, no, it happened.      

11:14.708 --> 11:16.108
        Whiskers!               

11:16.176 --> 11:17.743
        Here, Whiskers!         
        Whiskers!               

11:17.811 --> 11:19.211
                You know,       
              there's a lot     

11:19.279 --> 11:21.246
        of misunderstanding     
            about rats...       

11:21.314 --> 11:23.082
or <i>Rodendus vermicitis,</i>         

11:23.149 --> 11:24.683
as they're called               
in Latin.                       

11:24.751 --> 11:26.185
                    It turns out

11:26.252 --> 11:28.354
our long-tailed friend          
wasn't, after all, responsible  

11:28.421 --> 11:29.621
            for the dreaded     
                bubonic plague  

11:29.689 --> 11:30.756
                 as alleged     
              through history.  

11:30.824 --> 11:32.424
                    No, sir.    

11:32.492 --> 11:35.194
It's caused by an animal        
called the bubon.               

11:35.261 --> 11:37.062
                That's right.   

11:37.130 --> 11:39.365
        And the threat,         
 by the way, is still with us.  

11:39.432 --> 11:43.836
 So if anybody does see a bubon 
contact your local authorities. 

11:43.903 --> 11:46.939
    How about if we just see    
            a boob?             

11:50.610 --> 11:54.213
    Hey, guys, you're looking   
    at the two newest members   

11:54.280 --> 11:55.914
    of the Red Sox farm team.   

11:55.982 --> 11:59.218
         (all cheering)         

11:59.285 --> 12:01.253
              Who says you can't
             go home again, huh?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.188
                That would be   
                    Vera, Sammy.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.890
         Congratulations, Sammy.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.658
                 We all knew you
                    could do it.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.427
             Yeah.              
        Hey, hey, buddy.        

12:08.495 --> 12:10.429
 Let me have some water there,  
            will ya?            

12:10.497 --> 12:12.531
             Hey, you were great
                      out there.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.500
Oh, you, too.                   
You were fantastic.             

12:17.103 --> 12:19.705
        Whiskers!               

12:19.773 --> 12:21.073
Come on, Sam, we're late        
for our appointment             

12:21.141 --> 12:22.174
with the team doctor.           

12:22.242 --> 12:23.642
            Right behind you,   
                          Mitch.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.044
                    We are gonna

12:25.145 --> 12:27.413
        put the Red Sox         
back on the map, I'm tellin' ya.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.414
(screams)                       

12:28.481 --> 12:32.217
        (grunting)              

12:32.285 --> 12:35.187
Oh, my arm, my arm!             

12:36.990 --> 12:38.290
My arm! My arm!                 

12:38.358 --> 12:39.291
      Relax, I'm a doctor.      

12:39.359 --> 12:40.893
    Just remain still.          

12:40.960 --> 12:43.629
                Try not to move.
             Now tell me exactly
                  what happened.

12:43.697 --> 12:46.265
I saw a rat and I               
fell down the stairs.           

12:46.332 --> 12:47.266
                  A rat?!       

12:47.334 --> 12:50.002
Where?! Whiskers!               
Whiskers!                       

13:00.847 --> 13:02.448
 Hey, Wood, what's in the mail? 

13:02.515 --> 13:06.852
  Oh, just the usual. A couple  
 subpoenas from that Mitch guy. 

13:08.521 --> 13:11.390
Oh, hey, it's a postcard        
from Sam.                       

13:11.458 --> 13:13.025
                      All right.
              Oh, read it.      

13:13.093 --> 13:15.227
  "Greetings from New Britain,  
          Connecticut,          

13:15.295 --> 13:17.396
home of Shade Leaf Tobacco      
         and Carions."          

13:17.464 --> 13:19.698
    No, read what Sam wrote.    

13:19.766 --> 13:21.600
    That is what Sam wrote.     

13:21.668 --> 13:23.769
                Boy, oh, boy,   

13:23.837 --> 13:26.839
            the thought of Sammy
          out there on the mound
              chucking 'em down.

13:26.906 --> 13:27.940
Yeah.                           

13:28.008 --> 13:29.608
            What I wouldn't give
            to see that, huh?   

13:29.676 --> 13:32.411
No, it's only                   
a $30 train ride.               

13:32.479 --> 13:34.880
            Well, that's what   
                I wouldn't give.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.153
    Well, I finally resigned    
         myself to it.          

13:41.221 --> 13:42.654
We've tried                     
everything.                     

13:42.722 --> 13:44.223
         There's no way         
we're gonna find Whiskers.      

13:44.290 --> 13:47.760
A priceless, highly-trained     
laboratory animal;              

13:47.827 --> 13:51.563
virtually irreplaceable,        
so I went by the pet store      

13:51.631 --> 13:54.033
and dropped 99 cents            
on this guy here.               

13:55.402 --> 13:57.069
Well, what the hell?            

13:57.137 --> 13:59.938
They were gonna feed him        
to the boa constrictor anyway.  

14:00.006 --> 14:01.774
    What's all this other stuff?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.109
Oh, I snuck this out            
of the laboratory.              

14:04.177 --> 14:05.577
See, I've got exactly           
48 hours                        

14:05.645 --> 14:08.514
to teach this guy here          
everything that his             
predecessor knew.               

14:08.581 --> 14:09.915
      How are you gonna do that?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.617
Well, if-if you would,          
Rebecca...                      

14:11.685 --> 14:16.155
with a series of mazes and      
other such similar devices.     

14:16.222 --> 14:19.858
You see, lower forms of         
intelligence can be trained     

14:19.926 --> 14:22.728
to perform simple actions       
by rewarding them with food     

14:22.796 --> 14:25.364
when they perform correctly,    
or punishing them               

14:25.432 --> 14:28.334
with electrical shocks          
when they perform incorrectly.  

14:28.401 --> 14:30.302
        Hey, look at that, Norm,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.671
          I pushed down a lever,
                      got a nut.

14:35.775 --> 14:39.178
Hey!                            
I got a shock!                  

14:39.245 --> 14:41.714
    I got another nut.          

14:42.716 --> 14:44.216
    Ow! Hey!                    

14:45.585 --> 14:47.152
    A shock!                    

14:47.220 --> 14:49.254
    Oh, wait a minute. Let me   
        push your lever down.   

14:49.322 --> 14:50.856
              Hey!              

14:51.991 --> 14:54.259
             I got a shock, too!

14:54.327 --> 14:56.195
Oh! That's a mean               
little sucker!                  

14:56.262 --> 14:58.897
     Ah, one of these times     
  it's bound to give us a nut.  

14:58.965 --> 15:00.733
                      Ow!       

15:07.741 --> 15:09.074
                Here comes Paul.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.509
Huh? Oh. Hey, hey, Paul.        

15:10.577 --> 15:11.477
        Paul.                   
                  Huh?          

15:11.544 --> 15:13.112
    Listen, uh, do me           
    a favor, will you?          

15:13.179 --> 15:15.014
      Will you, uh, press       
one of those levers there       

15:15.081 --> 15:16.315
          and see what          
    happens, will ya?           

15:16.383 --> 15:18.684
     It isn't some kind of trick
            or something, is it?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.386
Oh!                             
        What?                   

15:21.488 --> 15:24.390
      Hey, I got a peanut.      
         Thanks, guys.          

15:29.229 --> 15:31.096
Which, uh, lever did he press?  

15:31.164 --> 15:33.065
                I thought you   
                  were watching.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.868
Aw, it's probably...            

15:35.935 --> 15:38.103
              Ah!               

15:38.171 --> 15:40.072
    Frasier, I'm home.          

15:40.140 --> 15:41.440
            Darling!            

15:41.508 --> 15:43.308
  Look, Whiskers, it's Mommy.   

15:43.376 --> 15:44.543
        Oh.                     

15:44.611 --> 15:45.644
    Look, hon, it's Whiskers.   

15:45.712 --> 15:47.279
You brought him                 
to the bar?                     
                      Well, yes.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.282
            I didn't want to let
             him out of my sight
            for a single minute.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.051
        I mean, you entrusted   
            me with his care,   

15:52.118 --> 15:53.619
        and I took that trust   
                 very seriously.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.954
That's not Whiskers.            

15:56.022 --> 15:57.623
                Of course it is.

15:57.691 --> 15:58.624
No, it isn't.                   

15:58.692 --> 16:01.326
            Yes, it is. Have you
                gone mad, woman?

16:01.394 --> 16:04.129
        I'm telling you, I swear
          to you that this, this
                rat is Whiskers!

16:04.197 --> 16:06.799
My Whiskers was clever          
and bright-eyed.                

16:06.866 --> 16:08.901
This rat is sluggish            
and slow.                       

16:08.968 --> 16:10.469
            Well, he missed you.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.708
            I missed you. I'm...
         sluggish and slow, too.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.779
Also, Whiskers responds         
to the sound of my voice.       

16:20.847 --> 16:23.582
This specimen shows no sign     
of recognition whatsoever.      

16:23.650 --> 16:27.052
Whiskers?                       
Whiskers?                       

16:27.120 --> 16:28.721
See? No response.               

16:28.788 --> 16:30.656
Where's my rat, Frasier?        

16:30.724 --> 16:32.491
                         Lilith,

16:32.559 --> 16:34.259
              as a scientist and
                as your husband,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.762
             I swear to you that
        this rat is Whiskers.   

16:36.830 --> 16:38.630
             And I must tell you
            I'm a little hurt   

16:38.698 --> 16:40.866
         by your accusation that
        I might try to fool you.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.335
      I look you straight in the
          eye and I swear to you

16:43.403 --> 16:44.503
        that this rat here is...

16:48.608 --> 16:50.242
            He's on my shoulder,
                    isn't he?   

16:50.310 --> 16:52.111
Come here, Whiskers.            

16:52.178 --> 16:54.747
                 Surprise! I got
                Whiskers a mate!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.551
          Oh, you lucky rat. Oh!

16:59.619 --> 17:02.521
            Now he has female   
                  companionship.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.124
Do I have female companionship? 

17:05.191 --> 17:07.291
Not for a long, long time.      

17:08.862 --> 17:11.030
      Nice going, mister.       

17:11.097 --> 17:15.099
Let's see if you're as sluggish 
    in the snake cage.          

17:23.143 --> 17:25.243
MAN:                            
Great game, Sam!                
You still got that arm!         

17:25.310 --> 17:26.244
(people cheering)               

17:26.311 --> 17:28.012
        Thanks, fellas!         

17:28.080 --> 17:29.648
  I was pretty good, wasn't I?  

17:29.716 --> 17:31.917
            Oh, man.            

17:33.720 --> 17:35.487
        (mutters)               

17:36.656 --> 17:38.257
            Oh, God!            

17:38.324 --> 17:39.224
    (knocking at door)          

17:39.292 --> 17:41.026
                             Oh!
             Sammy?             

17:41.094 --> 17:42.061
            Oh, hey.            

17:42.128 --> 17:44.163
                Aah! Hey-hey!   

17:44.230 --> 17:45.164
                Hey!            
        Carla, huh?             

17:45.231 --> 17:46.432
        What are you doing here?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.767
Ah, I came down                 
to see the game.                
You were great!                 

17:48.835 --> 17:50.369
Yeah, I was kind of good,       
        wasn't I?               

17:50.437 --> 17:51.670
    Yeah.                       

17:51.738 --> 17:53.072
            Who's taking care   
                     of the bar?

17:53.139 --> 17:54.473
Rebecca.                        
                     Oh, my God!

17:54.541 --> 17:56.408
Aw, I was just kidding.         
No one.                         

17:56.476 --> 17:58.077
            Ah, ah.             

17:59.579 --> 18:01.480
             You scared me there
                for a second.   

18:01.548 --> 18:03.082
Oh, Sammy, I...                 
seeing you up there...          

18:03.149 --> 18:04.083
                        Yeah?   

18:04.150 --> 18:05.084
...it was so inspiring!         

18:05.151 --> 18:07.152
I mean, you're better than ever.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.420
                    Thank you.  
You know,                       

18:08.488 --> 18:10.522
      everybody at the bar      
    is just so proud of you!    

18:10.590 --> 18:12.458
Look at you.                    

18:12.525 --> 18:13.459
        You look great!         

18:13.526 --> 18:14.860
You're pitching terrific!       

18:14.928 --> 18:16.829
        Yeah, I was kind of good
            out there, wasn't I?

18:16.896 --> 18:17.830
Yeah!                           

18:17.897 --> 18:20.799
  Hey, Monday, how's it going?  

18:20.867 --> 18:23.802
    Fine. Fine, Slim.           

18:23.870 --> 18:26.171
    Actually, it's Mayday, Slim.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.373
Mayday.                         
Yeah, uh...                     

18:27.440 --> 18:28.941
          Kid around a lot...   

18:29.109 --> 18:30.209
That's my friend                
Carla Tortelli.                 

18:30.276 --> 18:31.210
My roommate Slim.               

18:31.277 --> 18:32.244
        Hey.                    
            Nice to meet you.   

18:32.312 --> 18:33.312
You, too, Slim.                 

18:33.380 --> 18:34.913
                Say, by the way,
                 bunch of us are

18:34.981 --> 18:36.548
              going out for beer
            and pizza, you know,

18:36.616 --> 18:38.050
              get a little wild,
        do a little partying?   

18:38.118 --> 18:39.385
                 You interested?

18:39.452 --> 18:42.821
        Oh, thanks, but I'm here
    to visit my friend Sammy.   

18:42.889 --> 18:44.990
Sam, you got another clean shirt
         I can borrow?          

18:45.058 --> 18:46.358
Yeah, sure, go ahead.           

18:46.426 --> 18:50.262
Not that one.                   
Naw, go ahead.                  

18:50.330 --> 18:51.363
        Holy cow!               

18:51.431 --> 18:53.332
Feel free to get undressed      
        in front of me.         

18:53.400 --> 18:54.600
         Oh, I'm sorry.         

18:54.668 --> 18:56.935
    Oh, no, I mean, holy cow,   

18:57.003 --> 18:58.971
      feel free to get undressed
                 in front of me.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.642
 Hey, Sammy! Great game, baby!  

19:03.710 --> 19:04.977
          (chuckling)           

19:05.045 --> 19:07.346
                        Whoo!   

19:07.414 --> 19:08.781
Oh, here we go,                 
here we go!                     

19:08.848 --> 19:11.216
    Whoo! All right, fellas!    
          Whoa! Whoa!           

19:11.284 --> 19:12.618
          Oh, gotcha, gotcha!   

19:12.686 --> 19:15.487
Go, go, go, go, go, go!         

19:15.555 --> 19:18.057
      Time out! Time out!       

19:18.124 --> 19:20.626
         (all laughing)         

19:20.694 --> 19:22.528
Catch ya later, Midday!         

19:22.595 --> 19:24.496
            Mayday.             
 It's actually... it's Mayday!  

19:24.564 --> 19:26.331
                (laughs)        

19:26.399 --> 19:27.700
    Oh, you guys, man!          

19:27.767 --> 19:31.070
         I'll catch up          
     with you clowns later!     

19:31.137 --> 19:33.972
                Oh, they seem   
            like a fun bunch,   
                    huh, Sam?   

19:34.040 --> 19:35.607
Oh, they're                     
the best, yeah.                 

19:35.675 --> 19:37.309
That's, that's baseball.        

19:37.377 --> 19:38.911
That's what it's all about.     

19:38.978 --> 19:40.879
  And God, I hate it so much.   

19:43.049 --> 19:45.451
Get me out of here, Carla,      
please!                         

19:45.518 --> 19:46.518
                    What are you
                  talking about?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.020
Who am I kidding?               
I hate this!                    

19:48.088 --> 19:49.588
I mean, they,                   
they throw pillows!             

19:49.656 --> 19:51.256
They snap their towels!         

19:51.324 --> 19:54.026
And that's not funny.           
That's just dangerous.          

19:57.130 --> 19:59.565
Did you see that one guy        
pat my butt?                    

19:59.632 --> 20:00.799
I mean, that's not right.       

20:03.503 --> 20:06.071
            Come on. Hey, Sammy,
                     lighten up!

20:06.139 --> 20:07.773
Hey, hey, cut it out,           
will you?                       

20:07.841 --> 20:09.942
This thing's got zippers!       

20:10.010 --> 20:12.144
    What is wrong with you?!    

20:12.212 --> 20:13.846
Nothing's wrong with me, Carla. 
        I'm fine.               

20:13.913 --> 20:18.283
      It's just... I don't think
        I like baseball anymore.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.519
            You know, it's a,   
          it's a kids' game now.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.087
      And I'm not a kid anymore.

20:22.155 --> 20:27.159
             You know, I thought
                 it was gonna be
                 like old times.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.460
You know, that's the problem.   

20:28.528 --> 20:30.462
             It, it was <i>exactly</i> 
                 like old times.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.231
             You know, I've done
          all this stuff before.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.133
            It's just not me.   

20:34.200 --> 20:36.835
Maybe you should give it        
a little more time, Sammy.      

20:36.903 --> 20:38.971
I mean, you've only been here   
a few weeks.                    

20:39.039 --> 20:40.406
 Hey, look, you can't quit now. 

20:40.607 --> 20:41.607
     I'm not gonna let ya!      

20:41.675 --> 20:42.975
        Come on, Carla.         

20:43.043 --> 20:45.377
      You've supported me       
in all my other decisions,      

20:45.445 --> 20:47.312
                except for maybe

20:47.380 --> 20:49.214
      you know, going out       
         with Diane...          

20:50.517 --> 20:53.285
      And selling the bar       
and hiring Rebecca, and...      

20:53.353 --> 20:57.322
              you know, deciding
              to have a kid with
             her and everything.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.726
    What the hell kind of friend
                are you, anyway?

21:00.794 --> 21:04.596
        Oh, Sammy, even though I
    really think you quitting   

21:04.664 --> 21:07.599
         is a bonehead decision,
         I want you to be happy.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.703
Come on. Let's pack your bags   
        and I'll drive you home.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.404
    I, I don't have anything    
            to pack.            

21:12.472 --> 21:15.474
    The guys borrowed all my    
  clothes, even my underwear.   

21:15.542 --> 21:17.910
             Let's just get     
        out of here, okay?      

21:17.977 --> 21:20.646
  If you're really, really sure.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.682
  We just don't have anything   
        in common.              

21:23.750 --> 21:25.884
  It's not like I can ask them  
          to grow up,           

21:25.952 --> 21:28.220
      any more than I can,      
    well, stay a kid.           

21:28.288 --> 21:29.521
You know what I mean?           

21:29.589 --> 21:31.924
            Oh, God.            
          Here we go.           

21:33.326 --> 21:35.294
Hey, Sammy.                     

21:35.362 --> 21:36.995
                 Hey, Slim.     

21:37.063 --> 21:39.365
I thought you guys were gonna go
        barhopping, huh?        

21:39.432 --> 21:42.501
      We figured we should      
    spend a night in.           

21:42.569 --> 21:43.736
            Really?             

21:43.803 --> 21:45.004
Yeah.                           

21:45.071 --> 21:46.772
                After all, we're
             in training, right?

21:46.840 --> 21:51.143
  You mean, you guys just want  
     to sit around and talk     

21:51.211 --> 21:53.379
     and maybe watch a little TV
                and hang out?   

21:53.446 --> 21:55.647
Well, sure, if, uh,             
that's okay with you.           

21:56.916 --> 21:59.518
    Yeah, yeah, that's fine.    
             Yeah.              

21:59.586 --> 22:02.121
Yeah, we thought we'd just come 
    back to the room,
