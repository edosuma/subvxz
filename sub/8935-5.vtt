WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:01.067
evergreen forest,

00:03.870 --> 00:06.139
quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.176
That is until Bert
raccoon wakes up.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.011
Yahoo!

00:14.047 --> 00:14.881
Whoo-hoo!

00:16.783 --> 00:17.617
Yikes!

00:23.656 --> 00:25.792
Luckily he
has some good friends

00:25.792 --> 00:27.160
to help him out.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.836
Life would be simple in
the forest except for:

00:38.038 --> 00:39.739
Cyril Sneer.

00:43.009 --> 00:45.345
And his life would
be simple except for:

00:46.346 --> 00:47.113
The Racoons.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.065
It seems like long
weekends are a time

01:05.065 --> 01:07.167
when everyone heads
for the country.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.170
But for Bert raccoon
and his friends,

01:10.170 --> 01:13.306
a long weekend is a
time for adventures

01:13.306 --> 01:15.442
in their own backyard.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.244
And Bert Raccoon,
champion race driver

01:18.244 --> 01:21.915
shatters the lap record as
he rounds the final turn,

01:21.915 --> 01:26.052
and screams down the
home straight away!

01:26.052 --> 01:27.587
Hooray yeah!

01:27.587 --> 01:29.456
What a race!

01:29.456 --> 01:32.559
And the winner,
Turbo Bert Raccoon!

01:34.661 --> 01:36.629
Boy, she's a beaut!

01:36.629 --> 01:37.964
Thanks, Cedric.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.300
It took me two months
of delivering papers

01:40.300 --> 01:41.935
to save up for it,

01:41.935 --> 01:45.605
and worth every penny
if I do say so myself.

01:46.573 --> 01:47.841
Have a good weekend, Burt.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.110
Wouldn't have
any other kind, Ralphie!

01:51.044 --> 01:52.946
Enjoy your camping trip!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.814
Now you behave
yourself Bentley,

01:54.814 --> 01:56.683
and do what your
sister tells you.

01:56.683 --> 01:57.884
Sure mom.

01:57.884 --> 01:58.818
Bye
guys! Bye, Bentley!

01:58.818 --> 01:59.819
See you later.

01:59.819 --> 02:00.753
Have fun.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.756
Okay guys,

02:03.756 --> 02:06.059
have we got a great
weekend lined up or what?

02:06.059 --> 02:07.460
Boy you said it, Bert.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.461
Yeah!

02:08.461 --> 02:10.430
Fishing, hiking, swimming.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.532
And what better
way to kick it off,

02:12.532 --> 02:14.734
than with one of Bert Raccoon's

02:14.734 --> 02:17.403
mega peanut butter sandwiches?

02:18.271 --> 02:19.572
Come on.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.741
I thought
you'd never ask.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.310
Gee, Burt, when do I
get a turn on the car?

02:24.310 --> 02:25.845
Right after lunch.

02:25.845 --> 02:28.815
We'll eat, then I'll show you
how to work the radio control.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.217
I already know how.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.820
Hey, Cedric, you want
a peanut butter milkshake

02:33.820 --> 02:36.322
or a peanut butter
float for dessert?

02:40.660 --> 02:44.197
And here's Bentley raccoon,
champion Formula One driver.

02:48.735 --> 02:49.969
Oh, no! Stop!

02:53.239 --> 02:54.874
Surprise!

02:54.874 --> 02:56.276
Look out!

02:56.276 --> 02:57.810
Ahh!

03:00.413 --> 03:01.714
Oh, no.

03:04.284 --> 03:08.321
My car, my beautiful car.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.193
Come on, don't daddle!

03:13.193 --> 03:15.128
Hup to, hup to, hup to!

03:15.128 --> 03:16.362
Faster, faster!

03:16.362 --> 03:17.997
You'll feel disaster!

03:17.997 --> 03:20.266
Hup to, hup to, hup to.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.769
quit whining you puffy porkers.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.604
It'll do you the world of good.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.105
No, Snag, noooo!

03:27.574 --> 03:31.277
That's it boy, keep
giving Snagarooni incentive.

03:31.277 --> 03:35.081
We'll work him down to a
fine sleek physique yet.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.583
Ha ha!

03:36.583 --> 03:38.751
Couldn't we just enter Snag
in the overweight division?

03:38.751 --> 03:40.086
You out of your mind?

03:40.086 --> 03:42.989
Snag's a blue point
ridge back retriever.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.758
He's going to win the cash
prize for best of show,

03:45.758 --> 03:48.695
or you three will
get the worst of me!

03:48.695 --> 03:49.529
Kupish?

03:53.499 --> 03:54.901
Back off, Snag!

03:57.470 --> 04:00.573
Lady Baden-Baden's
dog show's only two days

04:00.573 --> 04:02.775
from now and Snag
better be ready.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.277
I'll check back in a few hours,

04:04.277 --> 04:06.212
so keep on trotting, boys.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.581
Ha ha ha!

04:09.949 --> 04:11.985
Three bucks,
three lousy bucks.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.186
Look, Bentley.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.722
You don't have to pay
me back right now.

04:15.722 --> 04:16.823
Oh yes I do.

04:16.823 --> 04:18.758
I pay all my debts.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.896
Hey Lisa?

04:23.896 --> 04:25.365
No way!

04:25.365 --> 04:26.833
But you don't even know
what I'm going to say.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.701
You want me to
give you money to pay

04:28.701 --> 04:30.870
for Bert's car and
the broken window?

04:30.870 --> 04:32.672
And I said no way.

04:32.672 --> 04:33.673
Oh fine.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.641
Nice sister.

04:34.641 --> 04:35.975
It was your fault Buster,

04:35.975 --> 04:37.176
So you pay for it.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.045
Thanks for nothing.

04:39.045 --> 04:42.248
Hey watch it, little buddy,
or you'll break another one.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.550
How about this?

04:44.550 --> 04:46.219
I'll split my paper
route with you

04:46.219 --> 04:48.254
and in just a couple of months-

04:48.254 --> 04:50.256
That's forever.

04:50.256 --> 04:51.924
I'll make
you a deal, Bentley.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.227
Do my chores for
the next two months.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.162
And I'll give you the money
and we'll call it square.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.096
No, thanks.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.531
I wouldn't wanna put you out.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.333
I can take care of this myself.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.136
Okay Mr. Independence,
have it your way.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.070
I'm off to work.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.805
Dinner's in the fridge.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.707
So um.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.609
Bert, I wouldn't
mind some privacy.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.177
I've got things to think about.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.579
Sure. I, I understand.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.449
No, I'll just walk
Lisa to the museum.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.959
Colonel Jethro
Smith's genuine treasure map.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.362
Uncover wealth beyond
your wildest dreams!

05:29.362 --> 05:32.465
Send just $2 for your own
deluxe personal treasure map,

05:32.465 --> 05:35.034
and you'll discover
treasures in your backyard!

05:36.836 --> 05:40.106
Wow! What
a place to work!

05:40.106 --> 05:41.307
Oh yes I,

05:41.307 --> 05:43.509
I know it's terrible, but,

05:43.509 --> 05:47.680
but one of these days I'll
get around to sorting it all.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.284
No, I mean, it's fabulous.

05:51.284 --> 05:52.518
Oh, well!

05:53.886 --> 05:55.988
Very kind of you to say so.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.290
So what am I doing
today Professor?

05:57.290 --> 05:58.725
Labeling the jewel collection?

05:58.725 --> 05:59.959
Polishing the ancient armor?

05:59.959 --> 06:02.962
Oh much, much better
than that, Lisa my dear.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.932
Oh, no today you'll be filing!

06:06.833 --> 06:08.501
Filing? All of it?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.003
Yes, yes!

06:11.003 --> 06:12.872
Well, you needn't do all
of it today, of course.

06:12.872 --> 06:17.877
But we we've got treaties and
building plans, legal papers-

06:18.978 --> 06:22.782
Oh here, these are
detailed maps and charts

06:22.782 --> 06:26.018
of the entire evergreen forest.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.520
Exciting isn't it?

06:29.422 --> 06:30.957
They are invaluable, you know.

06:30.957 --> 06:34.627
Oh my. Would you file them
under E, for Evergreen?

06:34.627 --> 06:37.296
Or F, for forest?

06:37.296 --> 06:40.666
Hmm. Oh well, have fun my dear.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.101
I'll get right
on it, professor.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.203
Oh, I like your
attitude, Lisa.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.606
You will go far. Yes, far.

06:46.606 --> 06:50.109
My brother went far,
never did fight.

06:50.109 --> 06:54.580
Yeah. Far all right.
Far into the night.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.549
What a mess.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.750
Oh!

06:57.750 --> 07:00.119
So I guess Bentley's
pretty mad at me.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.621
Well, you know-

07:01.621 --> 07:03.756
I've been working
here for a month to save

07:03.756 --> 07:04.957
for a brand new pair of

07:04.957 --> 07:07.727
super foam power surge
basketball shoes.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.129
And he wants me to just
hand that money over to him!

07:10.129 --> 07:11.397
Just like that!

07:11.397 --> 07:13.299
Selfish little brat.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.735
Ah, take it easy on
the little guy, Lisa.

07:15.735 --> 07:19.138
He's just, you know, a kid.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.973
And well, kids get in trouble.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.408
Yeah. Well it's his trouble.

07:22.408 --> 07:23.910
Not mine.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.546
If you don't mind Bert, I'm
going to be a little busy.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.783
I guess I know
when I'm not wanted.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.151
Anywhere.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.085
See you Lisa.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.357
I'm falling apart.

07:38.357 --> 07:41.561
If you stop now,
you'll be torn apart.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.895
Oh! He's gaining!

07:48.634 --> 07:50.403
Snag may not be trimmed
down for the dog show,

07:50.403 --> 07:55.408
but if we don't lose him soon,
he's going to trim us down!

07:57.543 --> 08:00.580
In here boys, it's
our only chance!

08:15.094 --> 08:17.530
That's it boys, we're safe!

08:18.798 --> 08:21.434
Maybe, but I know
one thing for sure.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.268
What?

08:23.269 --> 08:24.337
We're lost.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.672
Oh.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.746
Bentley,
are you gonna finish

08:33.746 --> 08:34.914
this breakfast or what?

08:34.914 --> 08:37.316
Nah, throw it away.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.151
Hey, good morning.

08:39.151 --> 08:41.654
Anything for Bentley
Raccoon, Esquire?

08:41.654 --> 08:42.922
Hey Bentley.

08:42.922 --> 08:43.956
I'm off work.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.892
Bentley?

08:45.892 --> 08:46.826
This is it.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.462
Thank you Colonel Jethro Smith.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.730
What have you got there?

08:50.730 --> 08:52.965
None of your bees wax.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.768
Fine. I'll be at
the museum working.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.870
Which is something you'd
better think about,

08:57.870 --> 09:00.206
unless you're just planning to
forget about the broken car,

09:00.206 --> 09:02.508
and the broken window.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.110
Sure, sure.

09:05.411 --> 09:08.147
Look out easy
money, here I come.

09:09.582 --> 09:13.352
Okay. Bentley.
Well, some other time then.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.854
Bentley's busy,

09:14.854 --> 09:17.723
So it looks like it's just
you, me and the fish, Bert.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.692
Just about
done here, Cedric.

09:19.692 --> 09:20.626
Hey Broo,

09:20.626 --> 09:22.295
what do you think of this poach?

09:24.830 --> 09:26.566
Yeah, me too.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.335
Lady Baden-Baden
said she'd pick up

09:29.335 --> 09:31.437
the dog show posters later.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.105
I'll just leave her a note.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.842
Hi Pop, what's up?

09:36.842 --> 09:39.912
Larceny, grand
theft, pooch-napping!

09:39.912 --> 09:41.147
That's what's up.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.349
I want this plastered
all over the front page

09:43.349 --> 09:45.017
of your alleged newspaper.

09:45.017 --> 09:48.521
"Wanted: three
pigs for the theft

09:48.521 --> 09:52.458
of one blue point
ridge back retriever.

09:52.458 --> 09:55.461
Answers to the name of Snag"

09:55.461 --> 09:58.965
Generous reward for
any information?

09:58.965 --> 10:01.267
But Pop, your kidding, right?

10:01.267 --> 10:03.903
Does this look like the
face of a kidder, son?

10:03.903 --> 10:05.972
Those three perfidious porkers

10:05.972 --> 10:08.374
made off with my
champion show dog.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.875
They've been gone all night,

10:09.875 --> 10:11.911
probably across
the border by now.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.179
Ah, come on Cyril.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.947
There must be some
other explanation.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.683
Who can explain the
mental workings of a pig?

Log of the
Bentley Expedition.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.789
Colonel Jethro Smith's map
has led me to the entrance

10:23.789 --> 10:25.958
of the endless echo caverns.

10:25.958 --> 10:30.830
Somewhere in there lies a
secret to success and treasure.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.866
How long
have we been down here?

10:35.334 --> 10:36.669
Forever.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.105
Let's face it. We're doomed.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.008
Finished.

10:42.008 --> 10:44.343
Food for worms.

10:47.780 --> 10:52.184
We'll I never see the
light of day again!

Trolls! Ah!

11:05.231 --> 11:08.234
The cavern is full
of strange sounds.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.103
I can only assume it's the wind.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.324
Help!

12:40.726 --> 12:42.661
Bentley! We're saved!

12:44.330 --> 12:47.166
Aww Bentley, my hero!

12:47.166 --> 12:48.734
You've come to take me home.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.705
Oh, oh, oh, thank
you. Thank you.

12:55.074 --> 12:55.875
Help!

13:00.212 --> 13:01.847
I'm interrupting this program

13:01.847 --> 13:04.250
to bring you a public
service announcement.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.018
Have you seen these hoodlums?

13:06.018 --> 13:09.622
These hard-bitten miscreants
are wanted for dog napping.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.657
Any information as
to their whereabouts

13:11.657 --> 13:14.093
should be forwarded
to Sneer Central.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.529
He's taken his backpack,
sweater and flashlight,

13:16.529 --> 13:18.097
and his tape recorder.

13:18.097 --> 13:20.766
Only told us was he
didn't wanna go fishing.

13:20.766 --> 13:22.268
It's all my fault.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.803
I should have given
him the money.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.737
Come on.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.071
We gotta think logically.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.874
Now, where would Bentley
go needing a flashlight

13:28.874 --> 13:30.576
in broad daylight?

13:30.576 --> 13:32.578
Some place dark?

13:32.578 --> 13:35.748
With no electricity.
The Caverns?

13:35.748 --> 13:37.249
He knows better.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.252
Besides why on earth would
he go there by himself?

13:40.252 --> 13:42.154
For treasure!

13:42.154 --> 13:43.389
Listen to this.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.392
"Congratulations on
your wise decision

13:46.392 --> 13:49.195
to purchase one of
Colonel Jethro Smith's

13:49.195 --> 13:51.764
authentic personalized
treasure maps."

13:51.764 --> 13:53.032
It's a scam.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.101
The pigs sent away for
one in Mudman Comics.

13:56.101 --> 13:59.071
Pop confiscated it
and spent three days

13:59.071 --> 14:02.174
wandering around the
endless Echo Caverns.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.976
Oh Bentley.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.244
According to the map,

14:05.244 --> 14:07.446
that tunnel should
lead us out of here.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.014
It's worth a try.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.553
Oh! Another dead end!

14:15.888 --> 14:19.425
Oh, I wish you
wouldn't use that word.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.926
This doesn't make sense.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.361
Colonel Jethro's map says-

14:22.361 --> 14:25.764
Oh no!
Not Colonel Jethro!

14:25.764 --> 14:28.267
Why? What's wrong with Col-

14:31.403 --> 14:32.805
It's Snag!

14:32.805 --> 14:35.608
Oh, he's still out to get us!

14:35.608 --> 14:37.843
Get up here, Bentley!

14:37.843 --> 14:38.844
Ahh!

14:51.891 --> 14:53.692
I know it's
in here somewhere.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.661
The map's over 50 years old,

14:55.661 --> 14:57.162
but it's still the
most detailed map

14:57.162 --> 14:58.764
of the caverns ever made.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.532
Here it is.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.101
Well what are we wearing for?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.969
Let's hit the caverns!

15:06.605 --> 15:07.439
Oh dear.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.241
Sorry Professor!

15:09.241 --> 15:11.377
Where are you going
with that document?

15:11.377 --> 15:12.945
Sorry, no time to explain!

15:12.945 --> 15:15.514
You come back here right now,

15:15.514 --> 15:18.183
Or you're in a packet
of trouble, young lady!

15:18.183 --> 15:19.451
I say a packet!

15:22.154 --> 15:24.123
I'm coming.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.625
Please.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.795
Snag! My little Snagaroni!

15:29.795 --> 15:31.363
Good boy!

15:31.363 --> 15:34.099
What did those rotten
reprobates do to you?

15:34.099 --> 15:35.434
Oh, who cares?

15:35.434 --> 15:39.305
My blue ribbon, blue
point, oh my Snagaroons!

15:39.305 --> 15:41.640
We'll still win first prize.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.377
Hey, sit! Maladjusted mutt!

15:45.377 --> 15:48.047
Come back here you
cantankerous canine!

15:50.015 --> 15:51.684
Don't you wanna be a champion?

15:55.321 --> 15:56.689
Think of the prestige!

15:56.689 --> 15:58.057
Think of the money!

15:58.057 --> 16:00.192
Bentley!

16:00.192 --> 16:01.627
Answer us!

16:01.627 --> 16:03.095
Where are you?

16:03.095 --> 16:04.697
What if he's not
even down here?

16:04.697 --> 16:05.931
What if he is?

16:05.931 --> 16:08.767
We'll find him,
Lisa. I promise.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.236
Let's have another
look at that map.

16:11.236 --> 16:15.107
Get back here,
you flea-bitten flig!

16:15.107 --> 16:16.175
Snag?

16:16.175 --> 16:18.143
Get back here!

16:18.143 --> 16:19.211
Pop?

16:19.211 --> 16:20.312
Pop! Hey Pop!

16:22.147 --> 16:23.649
Good boy.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.883
Stay.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.151
Sit.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.019
Now. Lie down.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.554
Pop!

16:28.554 --> 16:29.421
Oh, hello son.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.292
What in the name of
spelunking are you doing here

16:33.292 --> 16:34.793
at this hour?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.463
Those overfed oinkers aren't
down here with you, are they?

16:37.463 --> 16:38.964
It's Bentley Mr Sneer.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.699
We think he's down
here somewhere.

16:40.699 --> 16:41.533
Lost.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.568
What is it, boy?

16:42.568 --> 16:43.469
Is it Bentley?

16:43.469 --> 16:44.770
Bentley!

16:44.770 --> 16:45.971
Bentley, answer me!

16:45.971 --> 16:48.107
Lisa! Come on,
we gotta stay calm.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.942
We've gotta think!

16:49.942 --> 16:51.710
Darn stupid kid.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.046
It'll take us days
to get to him.

16:54.046 --> 16:57.082
We don't have days.
We've got hours.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.317
What do you mean?

16:58.317 --> 17:00.652
Bentley's in
there, we're out here.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.021
This is the only way in,

17:02.021 --> 17:05.691
and this marks the
path of a stream.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.460
It must connect up with
Evergreen Lake somewhere.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.130
If there used to be a
stream flowing through here,

17:11.130 --> 17:13.432
where's all the water gone?

17:15.734 --> 17:17.069
We're sunk!

17:18.237 --> 17:20.806
We're nothing but shark food!

17:22.574 --> 17:25.677
Oh dear!

17:25.677 --> 17:26.512
Oh mom!

17:27.946 --> 17:30.315
Things haven't
worked out quite as planned.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.384
This might be the last
entry for a while.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.354
The air is getting bad.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.922
I must conserve oxygen.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.092
You don't even know

17:40.092 --> 17:42.528
if there is an underwater
entrance down here.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.063
There's gotta be!

17:44.063 --> 17:47.399
That underground stream
comes from somewhere, Pop!

17:47.399 --> 17:51.270
The map, says the caverns
go right out under the lake.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.738
All right.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.575
Just, just be careful Cedric
and bring Bentley back,

17:56.575 --> 17:59.511
because I wanna have a
serious chat with that boy.

18:22.201 --> 18:26.839
I was just thinking, if
we all drank a lot of water,

18:27.706 --> 18:29.341
maybe the level would drop.

18:30.542 --> 18:34.746
That's the dumbest
idea I've ever heard!

18:36.048 --> 18:37.883
Log of Bentley Expedition.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.453
Pressure is finally
beginning to take its toll.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.189
Hey! Look!

18:46.058 --> 18:47.826
Excuse me.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.863
Yes! We're saved!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.498
Bentley, you little idiot!

18:52.498 --> 18:54.133
Just wait till I
tell mom and dad!

18:54.133 --> 18:58.604
Well, I, boy, am
I glad to see you!

18:58.604 --> 19:01.773
You're looking pretty
good yourself, sis.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.809
What are
you three doing here?

19:03.809 --> 19:06.578
Drowning! Get us outta here!

19:06.578 --> 19:07.746
All right, everybody!

19:07.746 --> 19:09.148
let's share our tanks!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.315
Buddy system!

19:10.315 --> 19:11.984
Lisa, you take Bentley.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.218
I'll take two of the boys

19:13.218 --> 19:15.087
and you get the other one, Bert.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.622
Just breathe easy, Bentley.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.969
Bentley, my boy!
Cedric, are you all right?

19:30.969 --> 19:32.404
Piece of cake, Pop.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.572
Just fine.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.873
Thank you Mr. Sneer.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.942
Ha ha! Great.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.411
Uh, we're fine too, boss.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.747
What in the
name of water buffaloes

19:41.747 --> 19:43.081
are you doing here?

19:43.081 --> 19:43.916
Well, well, uh-

19:45.017 --> 19:46.251
Skip it!

19:46.251 --> 19:48.654
I'll deal with you water
logged warthogs later.

19:48.654 --> 19:49.922
Get in the boat.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.458
Well, I'll just
follow behind the boat,

19:53.458 --> 19:54.726
if you don't mind. Ha ha.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.364
Honestly, Bentley, I
don't know anyone else

19:59.364 --> 20:00.933
with a brother like you.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.168
The things I have
to put up with.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.803
Yeah, I know.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.005
Good thing I've got
a sister like you.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.175
Sometimes we all look

20:10.175 --> 20:12.411
for the easy way
out of our problems.

20:12.411 --> 20:15.881
But as Bentley found
out, making easy money is

20:15.881 --> 20:19.117
usually a lot more
difficult than it looks.

20:19.117 --> 20:21.587
I always knew you
were the best puppy, Broo!

20:21.587 --> 20:25.290
And now you've got
the award to prove it.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.092
Sit, Snag! Heel, boy!

20:30.095 --> 20:31.563
Darn mutt!

20:31.563 --> 20:34.066
I've got 15 minutes to
turn him into a show dog.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.100
He's up next!

20:36.835 --> 20:39.171
I wouldn't get
your hopes up, Pop.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.174
Hi, Mr Sneer. Thanks
for getting me this job.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.043
It's sure a lot easier than
getting money the easy way.

20:45.043 --> 20:47.279
Always. When this wraps up,

20:47.279 --> 20:49.681
there are a few things you
could do around the mansion,

20:49.681 --> 20:50.716
If you're up for it.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.317
You bet, Mr. Sneer.

20:52.317 --> 20:55.354
At this rate you'll get
a new car in no time, Bert.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.189
Not to mention the window.

20:57.189 --> 21:01.159
Oh, Mr Sneer, we're
almost ready for your dog.

21:01.159 --> 21:04.029
A blue something or other?

21:05.797 --> 21:08.000
He's just about ready.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.536
So young lady, I'll expect
you for work as usual,

21:11.536 --> 21:12.504
this afternoon?

21:12.504 --> 21:13.772
Yes, sir.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.974
And I'm sorry about the map.

21:15.974 --> 21:19.278
Oh, no harm done, my dear.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.913
I have a little
brother too, you know?

21:21.913 --> 21:24.349
Yeah. Funny things, brothers.

21:26.852 --> 21:30.355
Oh, that it! Hold him
Mr Sneer, hold him!

21:30.355 --> 21:33.425
Bring your dog to the ring!

21:35.994 --> 21:38.930
Last call for Cyril
Sneer and Snag!
