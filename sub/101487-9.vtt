01:23.959 --> 01:26.643
It's Christmas time.

01:26.662 --> 01:28.478
Yeah, Lois, I knew
it was Christmas a week ago

01:28.539 --> 01:31.665
when the "O" in the PornHub
logo became a wreath.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.317
-Same.
-Nice.

01:33.377 --> 01:34.985
Listen, there's a lot of work
to be done

01:35.003 --> 01:37.654
to make this place look festive,
and unlike most years,

01:37.756 --> 01:40.340
where I do everything,
this year I want you all

01:40.434 --> 01:42.083
to help
with the Christmas chores.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.844
Come on, Lois.
You know the deal around here.

01:43.996 --> 01:46.830
We split everything zero-100,
like most couples.

01:46.849 --> 01:48.423
And I also have another request.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.167
I'd like
to finally get a present

01:50.227 --> 01:52.093
from the heart this year.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.946
Not just
some defective clothing item

01:54.139 --> 01:56.022
Peter got on clearance
at Marshalls.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.266
But you love The Roling Stons.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.952
Now, to make sure
you don't forget your chores,

02:00.121 --> 02:01.678
I've made you each a list.

02:01.738 --> 02:04.514
And I want all
of these completed by tomorrow.

02:04.533 --> 02:07.351
Sorry. I can't do chores.
My trick elbow is acting up.

02:07.369 --> 02:09.962
-Is that your card?
-No.

02:10.155 --> 02:12.673
Oh, boy,
it's worse than I thought.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.623
Why are we doing our Christmas
shopping at the strip mall?

02:21.725 --> 02:23.717
'Cause we ran out
of gas out front.

02:23.869 --> 02:25.869
You got
to get that gas gauge fixed.

02:25.929 --> 02:28.038
Look, Chris, did you want
the gas gauge fixed,

02:28.056 --> 02:29.464
or did you want a year
of Quibi?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.299
The gas gauge.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.485
I'm sure we can find everything
on Mom's list here.

02:33.637 --> 02:35.303
It doesn't look so bad.

02:35.364 --> 02:39.491
If this place doesn't have Baby
Yoda toys, I swear to God...

02:39.660 --> 02:42.402
I'll probably buy something
with Spider-Man on it.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.979
Okay, guys, now before
you can shop at a strip mall,

02:45.040 --> 02:46.981
you have
to use the free-standing ATM

02:47.042 --> 02:48.575
that's chained to a pole

02:48.727 --> 02:51.128
and not affiliated
with any known bank.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.732
Good. It's taking
an extra-long time

02:55.792 --> 02:58.068
to read the card and probably
stealing the number.

02:58.128 --> 03:01.847
Select "yes"
to pay $15 fee. No brainer.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.407
Perfect.
Now I can't read the screen,

03:03.467 --> 03:05.333
'cause the glare is so bad.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.910
And it's not giving me
my card back.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.929
-(phone ringing)
-Hello?

03:09.081 --> 03:10.355
Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.708
Not anymore?
Well, thanks for telling me.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.360
Look, there's a card
and nice paper store.

03:15.553 --> 03:19.198
Let's go walk around it slowly
and let out tiny farts.

03:19.391 --> 03:21.849
-(door bells tinkle)
-(soft instrumental music plays)

03:21.952 --> 03:24.536
Hmm. Nice, thick card stock.

03:24.729 --> 03:25.946

03:26.098 --> 03:27.855
Ah, yes,
that's a very bright white.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.857

03:29.919 --> 03:31.359
Ooh, Century Gothic font.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.694
(loud, rumbling,
gas expulsion)

03:32.755 --> 03:36.531
Miss, this store
is for tiny farts only.

03:36.592 --> 03:40.052
There's a Lids next door
for that sort of thing.

03:42.448 --> 03:44.781
Welcome to the strip mall
H&R Block.

03:44.841 --> 03:46.225
Yes, I'd like to do my taxes.

03:46.418 --> 03:49.119
-How much does H charge?
-$59.

03:49.221 --> 03:50.896
Hmm. How much does R charge?

03:51.089 --> 03:52.789
$59.

03:52.891 --> 03:56.718
Does R know H has a side thing
going with M? H&M?

03:56.779 --> 03:58.462
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:58.522 --> 04:00.388
Is H back from lunch yet?

04:00.449 --> 04:02.908
Sorry. He said he was held up
with a client.

04:03.101 --> 04:06.319
You were with M again,
weren't you?!

04:06.472 --> 04:07.804
What? No, I wasn't.

04:07.823 --> 04:09.939
Then why are you wearing
a designer-looking shirt

04:09.959 --> 04:11.399
at a fraction of the cost?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.234
Maybe I<i> wanted</i> to get caught.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.088
I told you what I'd do
if I ever caught you cheating.

04:16.281 --> 04:18.298
This is on you!

04:19.584 --> 04:22.427

04:22.579 --> 04:24.337

I was just taking a pee.
