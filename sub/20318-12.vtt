Do you think the police 
are here again? 

00:30.182 --> 00:31.853
- Bet 10 bucks? 
- What will be the time? 

00:31.854 --> 00:34.275
Do not worry, 
who's counting? 

00:34.365 --> 00:36.301
- 2 minutes and 50. 
- 2:50 minutes? 

00:36.302 --> 00:38.033
- Is counting. 
- I count it. 

00:38.034 --> 00:40.179
- Shooting of weapon? 
- That is why we sent. 

00:40.224 --> 00:43.206
- Apartment 14B. 
- Is the apartment of Leslie. 

00:43.259 --> 00:45.523
- Did you hear anything? 
- No, are locks to factories, 

00:45.575 --> 00:48.322
the walls have double 
layer of concrete. 

00:49.822 --> 00:51.556
She placed another lock. 

00:51.557 --> 00:53.038
People do not 
can do that. 

00:53.039 --> 00:54.962
- Can open? 
- No. 

00:54.963 --> 00:57.223
- What her name? 
- Leslie. 

00:58.358 --> 01:00.242
Leslie, are the paramedics, 
is listening to us? 

01:00.243 --> 01:02.899
Here is Osman Bey. We 
Police forced entry to. 

01:02.900 --> 01:04.980
Can you imagine if you have a 
a guard dog inside? 

01:06.215 --> 01:09.422
I'm scared. 

01:09.466 --> 01:11.594
Yes, we. 

01:11.918 --> 01:13.756
- Oz, we have come. 
- They want hope. 

01:13.757 --> 01:15.304
- There may be a sniper. 
- There is no shooter. 

01:15.305 --> 01:17.257
- Shooter? 
- Ok. 

01:17.258 --> 01:18.848
No, was the caretaker. 

01:18.849 --> 01:21.268
- We can not wait. 
- Not Toby! 

01:30.652 --> 01:33.597
Oz, she lost much blood. 

01:33.652 --> 01:35.329
We do not have permission 
to declare the death. 

01:35.330 --> 01:38.123
We did everything we could 
until the ambulance. 

01:38.175 --> 01:40.317
It was six months ago. 

01:40.378 --> 01:42.364
The details are still 
clear in your mind. 

01:42.365 --> 01:44.367
Yes, unfortunately. 

01:44.419 --> 01:47.262
No further 
questions.

The game of Rogers

01:53.967 --> 01:56.629
Mr. Lynch, as 
is getting late 

01:56.656 --> 01:58.859
I would re 
for 10h in the morning, 

01:58.909 --> 02:01.141
where you can ask. 

02:01.201 --> 02:02.762
Thank you, Your Honor. 

02:02.763 --> 02:05.713
What madness, it seemed an episode 
of Law & Order in real life. 

02:05.933 --> 02:07.898
Be honest with me, 
Do I look like a fool? 

02:07.899 --> 02:10.413
The promoter was trying to 
it seems stupid. 

02:10.481 --> 02:12.766
It is the work of 
defense lawyers. 

02:12.814 --> 02:14.532
I was not the only, 
you were too. 

02:14.533 --> 02:16.202
You know I never 
change my expression. 

02:16.203 --> 02:18.301
You saw my face in game, 
I am like a rock. 

02:18.337 --> 02:20.337
It may be that. 

02:20.345 --> 02:22.559
We have a 1014 to meet 
Liberty in the Jefferson. 

02:22.610 --> 02:24.610
- Really? 
- Yes 

02:44.239 --> 02:45.688
What is going on here? 

02:45.689 --> 02:47.990
The guy came up here. 
Seems to be agreed, 

02:48.028 --> 02:49.662
but does not speak anything. 

02:49.663 --> 02:52.366
Sir, can you hear me? 

02:52.400 --> 02:55.539
Are you in pain? 
Oz, bring the stretcher. 

02:56.026 --> 02:59.351
How are you? I am Toby. 
I take care of you. 

02:59.839 --> 03:03.819
- I know you. 
- Yes, I am a paramedic. 

03:03.885 --> 03:07.667
Toby. 
Are you sure? 

03:07.719 --> 03:09.975
What is your name? 

03:11.867 --> 03:14.499
I do not know. 

03:14.745 --> 03:18.338
I do not know my name.

Quality is irreplaceable! 

03:57.160 --> 03:58.881
- It is the unknown. 
- He came for 24 hours, 

03:58.882 --> 04:00.487
and not 
remember who he is? 

04:00.488 --> 04:02.358
No idea. 
No wallet, 

04:02.359 --> 04:04.768
- No keys, shadow. 
- How is he? 

04:04.814 --> 04:06.814
Some injuries 
in the head by accident. 

04:06.817 --> 04:09.622
No apparent trauma to his head. 
I have to do more tests. 

04:09.657 --> 04:11.657
Okay. 

04:12.260 --> 04:14.325
How is the trial? 

04:14.370 --> 04:16.738
It is only the 
preliminary hearing, 

04:16.772 --> 04:18.909
be questioned today. 

04:18.935 --> 04:20.557
And is it for now. 

04:20.558 --> 04:23.178
And how is the rest 
of your week? 

04:23.218 --> 04:24.859
You want out? 

04:24.860 --> 04:28.404
You are free. 
You want out? 

04:28.478 --> 04:31.123
- Maybe I call you? 
- Maybe I call you? 

04:31.124 --> 04:32.524
- Okay. 
- Or you can ... 

04:32.525 --> 04:34.525
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 

04:49.599 --> 04:52.513
Excuse me, the audience 
first became a circus? 

04:52.551 --> 04:54.912
Yes, deaths of celebrities 
are generally well. 

04:55.066 --> 04:56.723
What is the bid of Peter Garvin? 

04:56.724 --> 04:58.798
Producer of many disks 
and many problems too. 

04:58.799 --> 05:01.383
Since illegal possession 
to tax evasion. 

05:01.413 --> 05:03.159
That is why he needs 
a very good lawyer? 

05:03.160 --> 05:05.078
Yes, it is an event 
so enough. 

05:05.079 --> 05:06.884
He loves both the headlines 
as Rolex him. 

05:06.885 --> 05:09.779
E cream for the USA 
eyes of 100 dollars. 

05:10.003 --> 05:13.159
Mr. Logan, it was stated 
who entered the apartment 

05:13.202 --> 05:15.820
Leslie Cahill of the force. 
This information shall? 

05:15.989 --> 05:17.750
Making yes. 

05:17.751 --> 05:21.832
As entered the apartment 
Leslie of the night in question? 

05:21.880 --> 05:23.880
She placed a second 
lock on the door, 

05:23.931 --> 05:27.007
and the caretaker 
did not have the key. 

05:27.039 --> 05:28.891
How come? 

05:28.892 --> 05:31.486
I used a fire extinguisher 
to break the lock. 

05:31.487 --> 05:33.122
Toby, no! 

05:33.123 --> 05:35.244
The protocol is not expected 
by strengthening police 

05:35.277 --> 05:37.547
when there is a shot of bullet? 

05:38.080 --> 05:41.426
Do not think, just respond. 

05:41.471 --> 05:44.246
My partner was in 
phone calling the police. 

05:44.298 --> 05:46.170
The police want to wait. 
There may be a sniper. 

05:46.171 --> 05:47.760
- There is no shooter. 
- Shooter? 

05:47.761 --> 05:49.737
Talk with him. Okay, 
get in touch. 

05:49.738 --> 05:51.404
I thought we had 
time to expect them 

05:51.405 --> 05:53.001
We are 
save her life. 

05:53.002 --> 05:55.690
That is what we were trying 
how to save someone's life? 

05:55.733 --> 05:58.489
Yes, this is the description 
of our work. 

05:58.542 --> 06:00.997
Toby, do not act as smart, 
he will rip you in half. 

06:01.063 --> 06:04.489
Mr. Logan, which has 
find that she was alive? 

06:04.538 --> 06:06.538
Leslie, are the paramedics, 
is listening to us? 

06:06.557 --> 06:08.818
We need police 
for forced entry. 

06:08.888 --> 06:11.722
I'm scared. 

06:12.487 --> 06:15.483
- Mr. Logan? 
- Yes, excuse me, I ... 

06:17.163 --> 06:18.754
I have heard her crying. 

06:18.755 --> 06:20.662
When you entered, 
she was crying? 

06:20.663 --> 06:22.483
No, she was unconscious. 

06:22.484 --> 06:25.658
Indeed, it was more than 
unconscious that was not? 

06:27.574 --> 06:30.578
This is his report 
the incident? 

06:30.998 --> 06:32.754
Yes, my partner completed the. 

06:32.755 --> 06:34.762
- And you signed? 
- Yes, I signed. 

06:34.822 --> 06:37.277
Could read? 

06:37.494 --> 06:40.338
The victim is cold, 
without pulse or beat. 

06:40.390 --> 06:41.875
Code 5, Toby. 

06:41.876 --> 06:43.451
And her heart was stopped? 

06:43.452 --> 06:46.937
There are documented cases of 
people back to life. 

06:46.991 --> 06:49.100
What do you want? 

06:56.037 --> 07:00.256
When there are no signs of life, 
should not move at the scene. 

07:00.257 --> 07:01.742
There were signs of life. 

07:01.743 --> 07:04.747
You should expect 
the police, correct? 

07:04.787 --> 07:07.426
I thought I could save it. 

07:07.465 --> 07:09.707
Based on what? 

07:11.251 --> 07:14.247
It is cold. 

07:14.287 --> 07:18.239
Mr. Logan? On what basis 
you move the victim? 

07:18.287 --> 07:20.759
Training, instinct, I guess. 

07:20.804 --> 07:23.163
So you broke the 
apartment of the victim, 

07:23.213 --> 07:26.719
dragged its furniture, 
walked on top of her blood, 

07:26.779 --> 07:29.552
leaving his tracks, 
probably destroyed 

07:29.587 --> 07:32.288
which probably would 
the footprint of the killer, 

07:32.331 --> 07:35.003
and all this based on what? 

07:35.427 --> 07:38.898
Feeling. 
No more questions. 

07:38.939 --> 07:40.725
Already resuscitated 
victims previously. 

07:40.726 --> 07:44.058
You are excused, Mr. Logan. 

08:15.447 --> 08:17.668
- Cut 
- We were in the middle of recording, 

08:17.681 --> 08:19.818
Peter and Leslie not 
were understood, 

08:19.859 --> 08:21.925
it was clearly changed. 

08:21.969 --> 08:24.361
She was not able 
focus on music. 

08:25.322 --> 08:27.267
I can not hear, 
the music was low. 

08:27.268 --> 08:29.054
How not heard? 
You are drunk? 

08:29.055 --> 08:31.840
And at some point, 
things get hot. 

08:33.289 --> 08:37.192
You are pathetic, 
its stupid bitch. 

08:42.630 --> 08:45.131
I knew that Mr. Garvin 
has a gun? 

08:46.190 --> 08:49.104
Yeah, I saw her. 

08:52.527 --> 08:54.989
This is the gun? 

08:55.799 --> 08:58.569
Looks like it. 

09:08.010 --> 09:11.682
They discussed, 
she threw a drink on it and left. 

09:11.683 --> 09:13.469
And Mr. Garvin? 

09:13.470 --> 09:16.527
He left about 50 minutes later. 

09:18.281 --> 09:20.406
Lawyer. 

09:20.451 --> 09:25.064
When Mr. Garvin was 
although, he said you would? 

09:25.109 --> 09:27.026
No, it said. 

09:27.027 --> 09:29.864
- This is the gun? 
- Exactly. 

09:29.894 --> 09:31.867
Registered to Peter Garvin. 

09:31.868 --> 09:33.352
The find in a can 
garbage, the middle block 

09:33.353 --> 09:35.458
the apartment of Leslie Cahill. 

09:35.483 --> 09:39.302
The bullet from this gun? 

09:39.340 --> 09:41.826
Yes 

09:41.877 --> 09:46.347
Why are you so sure that 
Mr. Garvin pulled the trigger? 

09:46.411 --> 09:48.606
- Because the victim said. 
- The victim? 

09:48.607 --> 09:50.159
According to 
Registered telephone, 

09:50.160 --> 09:53.746
she called her sister to 
12:02, then at 12:43, 

09:53.781 --> 09:55.346
the night he was killed. 

09:55.347 --> 09:58.546
It is the telephone registration 
that it? 

09:58.695 --> 10:01.189
- Yeah. 
- What filth! 

10:01.946 --> 10:03.904
Thank you, Detective Marks. 

10:03.905 --> 10:05.979
Mr Lynch. 

10:06.881 --> 10:09.563
Detective Marks, how long 
Homicide was in when 

10:09.599 --> 10:12.308
was assigned to the 
Cahill murder? 

10:12.704 --> 10:14.216
Few months. 

10:14.217 --> 10:15.985
So to say that you are 
relatively new to 

10:15.986 --> 10:18.806
such 
police investigation? 

10:18.990 --> 10:22.594
I was well trained and prepared 
it does mean. 

10:22.642 --> 10:26.841
What I meant is that 
a new researcher 

10:26.878 --> 10:28.996
could be ignored 
some facts. 

10:29.038 --> 10:31.563
Objection. The lawyer 
is speculating. 

10:31.617 --> 10:33.296
Maintained. 

10:33.297 --> 10:37.885
You can say that this was a 
case, detective? 

10:37.938 --> 10:40.351
All homicides have 
their problems. 

10:40.404 --> 10:43.805
Problems such as the scene 
contaminated crime. 

10:43.864 --> 10:47.978
The scene of the crime was 
contaminated, detective? 

10:49.142 --> 10:50.766
The paramedics did 
work in accordance with ... 

10:50.767 --> 10:53.848
The scene of the crime was 
contaminated? 

10:53.921 --> 10:57.737
- The paramedics ... 
- Yes or no? 

11:05.603 --> 11:07.888
Yes 

11:08.599 --> 11:11.233
No more questions. 

11:11.316 --> 11:15.055
Has no case. Lack of 
evidence, there we go. 

11:15.106 --> 11:18.566
I would draw 
Rebecca Cahill. 

11:19.760 --> 11:24.018
She is beautiful, as her sister. 

11:24.656 --> 11:26.335
See, he has not. 

11:26.336 --> 11:28.836
- He should not ... 
- He tried to save her? 

11:28.907 --> 11:31.754
Leslie called me earlier 
that night, 

11:31.784 --> 11:34.328
and told me about the fight 
with Peter, 

11:34.374 --> 11:36.507
and told me that he had 
heard enough, 

11:36.543 --> 11:39.144
and was ready 
to leave him. 

11:39.180 --> 11:42.224
To leave the life of 
lies he fed. 

11:43.201 --> 11:46.979
So off she said, 
because he was in the door and 

11:47.024 --> 11:49.563
that I would return. 

11:49.786 --> 11:52.932
And to turn again, 

11:52.933 --> 11:56.417
Garvin said he shot her. 

11:56.458 --> 11:59.223
And who needed help. 

11:59.286 --> 12:01.232
And you have no reason 

12:01.233 --> 12:03.274
- To doubt of your sister? 
- Objection. 

12:03.327 --> 12:05.086
- She was dying! 
- Objection. 

12:05.087 --> 12:06.568
Leads to a conclusion. 

12:06.569 --> 12:08.251
Maintained. 

12:08.252 --> 12:12.379
You are doing well. 
Just not exaggerating. 

12:12.839 --> 12:14.839
She needed to die. 

12:14.855 --> 12:18.299
- What does she want? 
- Sorry. 

12:18.382 --> 12:21.110
I hate lawyers. 

12:21.171 --> 12:24.140
No more questions. 

12:24.190 --> 12:26.945
Lawyer. 

12:29.003 --> 12:31.467
Mrs. Cahill. 

12:31.542 --> 12:35.481
It is true that his sister had 
problems with drugs and alcohol? 

12:35.924 --> 12:37.533
Thanks to Peter Garvin, yes. 

12:37.534 --> 12:40.088
And it was amended 

12:40.136 --> 12:44.380
- The night of the recording? 
- No! Not when I spoke with her. 

12:44.748 --> 12:47.458
What difference does it make if it 
was a little drunk? 

12:47.519 --> 12:51.419
The musicians of the recording 
testified that they were 

12:51.458 --> 12:55.093
traveling, I think that is the 
word when USA cocaine. 

12:55.151 --> 12:56.988
She was well when I 
I spoke with her. 

12:56.989 --> 13:00.225
I was very angry, 
but was not, you know ... 

13:00.262 --> 13:02.194
she was well. 

13:02.195 --> 13:05.031
That was less than 1 hour 
after Peter Garvin 

13:05.059 --> 13:08.568
tried to calm her and 
she threw wine in it. 

13:08.624 --> 13:11.939
He has not attempted to calm her. 
He threatened. 

13:11.983 --> 13:15.870
Not according to the 
in the recording. 

13:15.957 --> 13:18.649
Well, was not the 
she said. 

13:18.702 --> 13:23.168
Ms. Cahill has a 
problem with Mr. Garvin? 

13:23.217 --> 13:25.259
I hate that motherfucker. 

13:25.324 --> 13:28.644
All my sister wanted 
was writing songs. 

13:28.708 --> 13:31.289
- Be a singer. 
- It was not what I asked. 

13:31.374 --> 13:34.089
He promised everything. 

13:34.137 --> 13:36.952
- You hate Peter Garvin? 
- He lied to my sister, 

13:37.007 --> 13:40.112
the betrayed, has become addicted to 
in drugs, then killed her. 

13:40.146 --> 13:43.510
Yes, I hate him. 

13:45.132 --> 13:46.846
Hates him enough to 
lying in court? 

13:46.847 --> 13:48.347
Objection. I do not know where 
lawyer is going with this 

13:48.348 --> 13:50.657
- Type of question. 
- The record shows 

13:50.658 --> 13:52.537
there were 2 calls made to 

13:52.538 --> 13:55.280
Rebecca Cahill's cell 
the sister, but what 

13:55.309 --> 13:58.859
record does not show is the 
content of these conversations. 

13:58.945 --> 14:01.352
This is something that simply 
we must accept that 

14:01.398 --> 14:04.889
young lady who clearly 
shows hatred for my client. 

14:04.936 --> 14:07.402
She told me that Peter Garvin 
shot it. 

14:07.452 --> 14:10.161
- He is the reason it is dead. 
- Okay. 

14:10.219 --> 14:13.646
You do not have to rely 
everything for them. 

14:13.994 --> 14:17.316
The question, Ms. Cahill, who is 
we do not know what she said. 

14:17.365 --> 14:20.832
The case against my client is 
entirely circumstantial. 

14:20.893 --> 14:23.191
Has no 
concrete evidence. 

14:23.237 --> 14:27.345
Still have the paramedics who 
destroyed the crime scene. 

14:27.452 --> 14:30.475
The testimony of a sister 
and emotional problems that 

14:30.519 --> 14:34.038
not cooperating with anyone, 
including research, 

14:34.070 --> 14:38.787
placed at the scene of Peter Garvin 
crime with a gun in hand, 

14:38.830 --> 14:41.138
and a murder in the head. 

14:41.177 --> 14:43.500
And she knows that? 

14:43.578 --> 14:45.912
Heard of the lips 
a woman dying. 

14:45.958 --> 14:49.941
The rate of blood alcohol 
of 1.5 and cocaine, 

14:49.961 --> 14:53.243
and heroin in his body. 
And the prosecution is asking us 

14:53.287 --> 14:56.467
to condemn a man for 
a first degree murder? 

14:56.508 --> 14:59.940
Sorry. All that 
I can do now is 

15:00.370 --> 15:02.847
ask the court to withdraw 
all charges 

15:02.888 --> 15:06.777
against my client based on 
total lack of evidence. 

15:06.816 --> 15:09.402
Let me remind you, Mr Lynch, 
it is a 

15:09.436 --> 15:12.504
preliminary hearing. 
Save for your showzinho 

15:12.505 --> 15:14.661
the trial of the jury. 

15:14.699 --> 15:17.500
With all respect, Your Honor, 
if it is pro jury. 

15:17.537 --> 15:21.036
Enough, Mr. Lynch. 

15:25.500 --> 15:26.981
Have a good day, man. 

15:26.982 --> 15:29.020
Later. 

15:29.920 --> 15:32.433
Hey, how are you? 

15:33.425 --> 15:35.920
Is far 
comfortable here. 

15:35.958 --> 15:39.519
In fact, I am not. 
Perhaps you could have a table ... 

15:39.557 --> 15:42.461
balls would be relaxing 
well, if I could order. 

15:42.462 --> 15:44.068
It is funny. 

15:44.069 --> 15:46.188
Then the judge will 
file the case? 

15:46.238 --> 15:47.819
I said, do not worry 
with that. 

15:47.820 --> 15:50.240
Lynch wants to avoid the jury. 
The judge did not close anything. 

15:50.277 --> 15:53.130
Fielder or more witnesses, 
more conclusive evidence. 

15:55.657 --> 15:58.518
Can I have this chair? 

16:02.259 --> 16:04.259
- Comfortable? 
- Yes 

16:04.599 --> 16:07.913
Yesterday, the court heard a 
thought of a guy 

16:07.960 --> 16:11.646
who had thoughts and 
strangers on Rebecca. 

16:11.690 --> 16:13.806
As Rebecca was not 
speaking the whole truth. 

16:13.846 --> 16:15.834
That she was lying. 

16:15.835 --> 16:18.171
Toby, you know the procedure, 
says the guy who is, 

16:18.208 --> 16:19.756
and I assume. 

16:19.757 --> 16:23.331
- Yes 
- I understand this time? 

16:25.359 --> 16:29.380
You know, like I said, 
maybe I will find before. 

16:29.438 --> 16:32.822
Let's hope so, because 
Rebecca is all we have. 

16:43.965 --> 16:47.011
Oi. Remember me? 
I am Dr. Fawcett 

16:47.039 --> 16:49.714
Absolutely. 
Between.

16:51.105 --> 16:53.930
We are with the results of 
examinations and your brain is 

16:53.953 --> 16:56.299
slightly swollen by 
accident, but nevertheless 

16:56.329 --> 16:59.700
- You will be fine. 
- Accident? 

16:59.965 --> 17:03.348
Yes, you got hit 
by a car. 

17:04.185 --> 17:05.789
Was anyone else hurt? 

17:05.790 --> 17:07.903
No, just you. 

17:07.923 --> 17:12.297
Had a problem of 
memory before the accident? 

17:13.038 --> 17:15.698
I think not. 

17:15.838 --> 17:18.219
Some things 
are confused, why? 

17:18.252 --> 17:21.297
Well, I have 
some more tests. 

17:22.446 --> 17:25.548
Okay. Bright. 

17:28.561 --> 17:31.381
Like Emily Dickinson? 

17:32.721 --> 17:36.847
"Hope" thing made of feathers 
Which is perched in the soul, 

17:36.894 --> 17:42.107
And sings a sound without words, 
And it never stops, 

17:46.650 --> 17:49.859
- This is beautiful. 
- I know all her poems. 

17:49.892 --> 17:52.861
- That is good. 
- Sorry, I forgot your name ... 

17:52.862 --> 17:55.239
Okay, is Olivia. 

17:55.318 --> 17:57.494
- Olivia? 
- Yes 

17:59.598 --> 18:01.244
See you later. 

18:01.245 --> 18:03.700
Sure. 

18:11.863 --> 18:13.899
Well, think Liv is Alzheimer's. 

18:13.942 --> 18:16.462
- What will they do with it? 
- I do not know. 

18:16.638 --> 18:18.224
And you? Did you 
with it? 

18:18.225 --> 18:20.339
- I did not get anything. 
- You entered the mind 

18:20.374 --> 18:22.449
a dead girl, 
but not this guy? 

18:22.484 --> 18:24.841
- Not that I make the rules. 
- Mr. Bey! 

18:24.881 --> 18:27.166
Mr. Bey, you are officially 
out of service. 

18:27.167 --> 18:29.078
- I know. 
- While in court, 

18:29.113 --> 18:30.858
is off. 

18:33.199 --> 18:37.158
6 months to discuss the board 
their actions as crack 

18:37.186 --> 18:40.036
apartment that the woman 
before the police arrive. 

18:40.078 --> 18:41.642
Guess what, gentlemen. 

18:41.643 --> 18:43.114
Now they are 
doing again. 

18:43.115 --> 18:45.005
- You are kidding. 
- Are you kidding me? 

18:45.006 --> 18:47.931
- Handle a scene of crime? 
- We tried to save her life. 

18:47.975 --> 18:50.036
Look, you do not need 
I say that. I know. 

18:50.079 --> 18:52.735
I said that 
those bureaucrats. 

18:53.044 --> 18:55.880
Listen, you can count on me. 

18:56.307 --> 18:59.618
Good job. 

19:00.521 --> 19:03.232
Can you hear me 
this thing? 

19:04.299 --> 19:06.224
We can hear you. 

19:06.225 --> 19:09.357
It happened the way that my 
partner told what happened. 

19:09.406 --> 19:12.463
What we do not know 
the actions of Mr. Logan, but 

19:12.509 --> 19:14.751
his intentions. 

19:14.795 --> 19:17.910
Why he invaded 
apartment of Ms. Cahill? 

19:17.964 --> 19:22.281
Well, as Toby, Mr. Logan, 
said. It is part of the work. 

19:22.877 --> 19:25.299
Then you rate the 
behavior of Mr. Logan 

19:25.342 --> 19:31.050
- As impulsive or unstable? 
- No, no. Not. 

19:31.504 --> 19:33.822
I ask because ... 

19:33.823 --> 19:38.725
this report provided by 
your supervisor, you describe 

19:38.761 --> 19:41.181
the behavior of 
your partner ... 

19:41.220 --> 19:46.520
often 
impulsive and unstable. 

19:46.571 --> 19:49.344
That was different. 

19:49.399 --> 19:52.935
This was before I found 
it would help. 

19:53.539 --> 19:58.542
And you heard the same requests 
of aid that Mr. Logan heard? 

19:59.110 --> 20:02.163
I mean, you hear? 
Hear it? 

20:02.616 --> 20:04.616
Yes 

20:09.752 --> 20:11.752
Mr. Bey? 

20:12.397 --> 20:16.819
Well, hear is ... 
Him .. 

20:17.567 --> 20:21.267
Toby has a good hearing, and 
listening better than me. 

20:21.268 --> 20:23.093
Thank you. 

20:23.094 --> 20:25.135
No more questions. 

20:27.715 --> 20:29.177
Knew he was lying. 

20:29.178 --> 20:30.718
Say anything 
to conceal. 

20:30.719 --> 20:32.119
I would enter the 
in my house. 

20:32.120 --> 20:34.120
You can not trust anyone. 

20:34.612 --> 20:36.792
No heat, 
was not so bad. 

20:36.793 --> 20:39.385
Mad? 
It seems that I was humiliated. 

20:39.386 --> 20:41.957
They are lawyers, man. 
They are evil. 

20:44.499 --> 20:49.093
She was so beautiful, 
had to die. 

20:52.274 --> 20:55.411
It is your fault, it should 
have tried more. 

21:00.866 --> 21:02.801
Oz, who is this guy? 

21:02.802 --> 21:06.046
- I do not know, never seen him before. 
- He saw us. 

21:06.576 --> 21:08.880
- What? 
- In the apartment of Leslie. 

21:12.922 --> 21:14.922
Gerrard Street with 
main, please. 

21:35.860 --> 21:37.574
When we were in 
Leslie's apartment, 

21:37.575 --> 21:38.998
he saw in the camera. 

21:38.999 --> 21:41.883
- What is the Leslie? 
- Top floor, 3 left. 

21:41.884 --> 21:43.285
- Here? 
- Yes 

21:43.286 --> 21:45.330
He must live in 
other side of the courtyard. 

21:45.331 --> 21:47.524
In observing 
the same floor. 

21:48.750 --> 21:50.155
Thank you. 

21:50.156 --> 21:53.055
- Yes, okay. 
- What to do? Knocking on doors? 

21:53.056 --> 21:55.964
- Yes, fight the doors. 
- That is the man? 

21:57.124 --> 21:59.154
Is. 
Hi! Hi, how are you? 

21:59.155 --> 22:01.376
- Okay? 
- What do you want? 

22:01.377 --> 22:04.383
The saw in court today, I 
know why you left so fast. 

22:04.384 --> 22:06.817
- It is a crime. 
- No, not a crime. 

22:06.818 --> 22:09.466
I was just wondering 
the reason for being there. 

22:09.499 --> 22:11.499
You knew the Leslie? 

22:14.278 --> 22:16.237
I do not think is in your account. 

22:16.238 --> 22:18.737
Yeah, if you know something 
about the murder. 

22:18.987 --> 22:21.519
- Okay, I gotta go. 
- What is a camera? 

22:21.520 --> 22:23.490
- How cool! 
- I can get! 

22:23.491 --> 22:26.225
Sorry, the door was open, 
I thought we were invited ... 

22:26.390 --> 22:28.762
Are the zoom lenses? 
How can it? 

22:28.763 --> 22:31.287
What do you want? 

22:31.288 --> 22:33.515
I wonder their relationship 
with Leslie here. 

22:34.213 --> 22:36.213
I do not know what 
you mean. 

22:39.468 --> 22:41.496
It was a pretty girl. 

22:42.938 --> 22:44.665
I could not stop. 

22:44.666 --> 22:48.186
I could not stop what? 
Pursue it? See it? 

22:48.187 --> 22:50.111
Not to pursue. 

22:50.112 --> 22:53.273
- You can go up there! 
- Toby will see this. 

23:03.322 --> 23:05.841
Looks like someone 
went well occupied. 

23:06.672 --> 23:08.672
You saw what happened? 

23:09.242 --> 23:10.676
If I had linked 
for emergency, 

23:10.677 --> 23:13.178
we arrived on time, 
and we could have saved it! 

23:13.904 --> 23:15.511
Toby, wait! 

23:15.512 --> 23:17.498
- We are not policemen. 
- Okay, we are not policemen. 

23:17.499 --> 23:19.449
This guy who saw 
was or was himself. 

23:19.450 --> 23:21.850
It is not our function. Already 
are trouble enough. 

23:21.851 --> 23:23.851
Easy. 

23:30.849 --> 23:33.530
His name is Gerald Cooper, 
is professional photographer, 

23:33.531 --> 23:36.238
Obviously this place 
is twice the studio. 

23:39.232 --> 23:41.232
That she was wearing 
the night he was murdered. 

23:41.427 --> 23:43.856
Or it is suspected or is 
our only witness. 

23:43.857 --> 23:45.515
Anyway, 
you scared him away. 

23:45.516 --> 23:47.964
In our defense, 
he scares easily. 

23:48.110 --> 23:50.418
Next time, talk 
before me, understood? 

23:50.419 --> 23:52.266
Yes, Detective. 

23:52.267 --> 23:54.267
Can we go? 

23:56.243 --> 23:58.243
She is always so angry? 

23:58.661 --> 24:01.148
According to police, no one is 
looking for a person 

24:01.149 --> 24:02.600
that looks like 
the unknown. 

24:02.601 --> 24:04.001
And the business of Emily Dickinson? 

24:04.002 --> 24:05.674
I talked to the schools, are not 
looking for a teacher 

24:05.675 --> 24:08.650
English and or poetry. 
All tests were negative, 

24:08.651 --> 24:10.161
- Must be Alzheimer ... 
- I leave. 

24:10.162 --> 24:11.576
t 
imagine anything else. 

24:11.577 --> 24:13.489
- I do not want to stay here. 
- Sir, need to calm down. 

24:13.490 --> 24:14.893
- No. 
- Lord ... 

24:14.894 --> 24:16.894
I will go! 

24:17.510 --> 24:19.180
Where you going? 

24:19.181 --> 24:21.650
Okay. Come on, all is well. 

24:21.699 --> 24:23.651
All is well. 

24:23.652 --> 24:25.057
- Ok. 
- I know you. 

24:25.058 --> 24:27.007
Yes, I brought you here. 

24:27.008 --> 24:29.488
Brought me here? 

24:33.486 --> 24:35.503
No, let's go back 
for your bed. 

24:36.875 --> 24:38.875
Come on. 

24:40.118 --> 24:42.659
Has a wife? Children? No? 

24:42.752 --> 24:46.007
- But you know me? 
- Yes, but you were younger. 

24:46.008 --> 24:49.252
The know by sight. 
The eyes have not changed. 

24:52.964 --> 24:55.611
Keep going. 

24:57.266 --> 25:00.204
- We can not stop. 
- What we can not stop? 

25:02.099 --> 25:04.949
We do not have much time 
before they ... 

25:07.383 --> 25:09.383
Before they what? 

25:10.540 --> 25:12.782
The door is closed 
suddenly. 

25:12.783 --> 25:17.407
And I, I lost. 

25:43.874 --> 25:47.386
Charlie, still 
nothing of pervert? 

25:47.387 --> 25:50.016
Nobody saw him, 
family or friends. 

25:50.017 --> 25:51.972
His name is Gerald Cooper? 

25:51.973 --> 25:54.949
God, is it all? 

25:55.050 --> 25:57.200
Yes, in different 
periods of time. 

25:57.201 --> 25:59.691
- From any other person? 
- If has not saved any, 

25:59.692 --> 26:02.061
run the cameras, 
microchips, computers, 

26:02.062 --> 26:04.271
- Did not find anything. 
- None of the Garvin? 

26:04.272 --> 26:06.272
No. 

26:06.332 --> 26:07.732
Maybe he was not there. 

26:07.733 --> 26:10.229
- No play. 
- I was joking. 

26:10.946 --> 26:13.135
- Here are the revelations. 
- Thanks. 

26:18.584 --> 26:20.634
Pictures of that night. 

26:24.456 --> 26:26.280
I do not think Lynch 
was wrong. 

26:26.281 --> 26:28.283
- Really? 
- And what has to Cooper, 

26:28.284 --> 26:30.286
I do not think she is talking 
the truth about the phone call. 

26:30.287 --> 26:31.850
It? 

26:31.851 --> 26:33.851
In fact, I know 
she was lying. 

26:34.924 --> 26:37.355
- Acknowledges the person in question? 
- Yes, it is Leslie. 

26:37.356 --> 26:39.084
Taken digitally 
that night. 

26:39.085 --> 26:41.085
By far, Ben expanded. 

26:42.128 --> 26:44.011
It is Rebecca? 

26:44.012 --> 26:45.806
Everyone thought it was Leslie, 
likely to Cooper, 

26:45.807 --> 26:47.807
but it was Rebecca, 
look at the time. 

26:47.865 --> 26:50.557
Was there at the time it would 
at home talking with Leslie, 

26:50.558 --> 26:52.558
and calling the emergency. 

26:54.594 --> 26:56.540
What we found? 

26:56.541 --> 26:57.955
What is he doing here? 

26:57.956 --> 27:00.561
I asked to come. He has 
a connection with the girl. 

27:00.608 --> 27:02.697
If you do not mind. 
Thanks. 

27:03.288 --> 27:05.288
Thank you. 

27:12.619 --> 27:15.877
You know that the case against Peter 
Garvin is circumstantial. 

27:15.878 --> 27:17.878
The defense was 
right about that. 

27:18.082 --> 27:21.642
Their credibility is 
that we have stronger. 

27:23.636 --> 27:26.679
Leslie told me was ... 
he ... 

27:26.680 --> 27:30.386
who shot her. 
So what we need? 

27:30.387 --> 27:32.387
Do not believe me now. 

27:33.337 --> 27:35.489
We have 
another witness. 

27:35.490 --> 27:39.141
- And I have found one. 
- God. 

27:39.324 --> 27:41.269
Looks like your sister 
was an admirer 

27:41.304 --> 27:43.223
across the courtyard. 

27:43.258 --> 27:45.695
He photographed 
every night. 

27:45.696 --> 27:47.615
My God, 
he saw what she did? 

27:47.616 --> 27:50.798
He saw everything, Rebecca. 
You were there. 

27:51.102 --> 27:53.102
What she did, Rebecca? 

27:59.212 --> 28:01.929
Peter Garvin no shot 
in his sister, is not it? 

28:03.198 --> 28:05.228
If you're hiding 
something we 

28:05.229 --> 28:08.037
perhaps to cover up 
their involvement. 

28:09.758 --> 28:15.427
Rebecca, if you lie under 
oath, we need to know. 

28:15.428 --> 28:17.778
- No. 
- If you tell us the truth now, 

28:17.779 --> 28:19.796
maybe we will 
wangle. 

28:23.461 --> 28:25.534
What happened 
that night, Rebecca? 

28:25.911 --> 28:27.602
You do not understand. 

28:27.603 --> 28:29.885
Peter Garvin 
destroyed my sister. 

28:30.272 --> 28:32.773
He may also have tight 
the trigger that night. 

28:33.707 --> 28:35.707
Who was it? 

28:51.127 --> 28:53.407
After her fight with Peter, 

28:54.553 --> 28:56.635
my sister was inconsolable. 

28:56.636 --> 28:58.677
Never seen her like that. 

28:58.877 --> 29:01.404
Talk by 
phone for a while ... 

29:06.543 --> 29:08.952
and then she hung up. 

29:08.953 --> 29:11.264
I went down there to 
see how she was. 

29:11.345 --> 29:15.463
When I arrived there, 
she had been killed. 

29:17.652 --> 29:19.652
She left a note. 

29:20.333 --> 29:22.333
It was ... 

29:22.642 --> 29:24.699
truly pathetic. 

29:25.081 --> 29:29.459
She said she loved Peter 
and could not live without it. 

29:30.658 --> 29:32.455
Thus armed against him? 

29:32.456 --> 29:36.055
He abused the insecurities 
it, the viciou on drugs. 

29:36.056 --> 29:38.441
Was responsible 
for what happened. 

29:38.442 --> 29:40.299
And I wanted him to pay. 

29:40.300 --> 29:42.416
So get rid of the ticket, 

29:42.482 --> 29:45.886
and tried to make 
appeared to have him. 

29:49.213 --> 29:52.748
Cleaned the gun, and played in a 
place where it found. 

29:54.009 --> 29:56.139
And the phone records? 

29:56.140 --> 29:58.476
I called the cell 
her to the man. 

30:00.005 --> 30:03.595
I wanted to make sure 
I was a witness. 

30:03.646 --> 30:05.646
To say it was him. 

30:05.682 --> 30:09.663
I repent. 
He deserved to pay. 

30:10.838 --> 30:13.681
And now? 

30:16.066 --> 30:18.849
Gone, Toby. I met 
with the judge in the morning. 

30:18.850 --> 30:20.387
Right and Rebecca? 

30:20.388 --> 30:23.395
I think they are negotiating. The 
government does not want to go after her. 

30:23.423 --> 30:27.123
Okay, the truth is more 
important to go after her. 

30:27.362 --> 30:31.060
- Toby, thanks. 
- Sure. 

30:31.120 --> 30:33.137
No problem. 

30:33.304 --> 30:34.796
- Hi Liv. 
- Oi. 

30:34.797 --> 30:37.791
- The unknown recalled? 
- No, but look at it. 

30:37.792 --> 30:39.355
What is this? 

30:39.356 --> 30:41.922
A daily and you are the 
only to it. 

30:41.962 --> 30:45.246
It is perhaps because I was the first 
he saw after the accident. 

30:45.275 --> 30:48.200
Maybe he is trying 
remember much of anything. 

30:48.229 --> 30:50.400
Go see it. 

30:50.439 --> 30:52.810
Want me to talk to him? 

30:52.919 --> 30:54.627
You want. 
Want to come with me? 

30:54.628 --> 30:56.901
I can not. 
I have a surgery. 

30:56.923 --> 30:59.608
Logan, you have a 
connection of the emergency. 

30:59.643 --> 31:03.434
He seems very agoniado, 
seems you have something to do. 

31:04.550 --> 31:06.587
Hallo. 

31:07.882 --> 31:12.295
It is the paramedic who 
was in my apartment? 

31:12.327 --> 31:14.803
Mr. Cooper? 

31:15.583 --> 31:19.375
- I saw everything. 
- What do you see? 

31:21.940 --> 31:24.431
Garvin was. 

31:24.464 --> 31:27.784
Mr. Cooper, where are you? 
You can come here and talk. 

31:27.818 --> 31:33.432
No. I want to be with her. 

31:33.468 --> 31:36.694
Mr. Cooper, stop the 
you're doing. 

31:39.268 --> 31:44.019
- I could not connect. 
- Tell me where you are. 

31:44.063 --> 31:45.718
We have succeeded. 

31:45.719 --> 31:48.139
It was my fault. 

31:48.333 --> 31:52.242
She is dead 
why not call. 

31:53.480 --> 31:58.275
I do not want nobody knows. 

31:59.098 --> 32:01.922
Mr. Cooper. Hello? 

32:01.963 --> 32:04.238
- We have achieved? 
- Okay. 

32:38.923 --> 32:40.781
- Get a mattress. 
- Right now. 

32:40.782 --> 32:42.351
It is. Here. 

32:42.352 --> 32:45.687
- Why did this? 
- I'll call the unit. 

32:45.725 --> 32:48.703
Cooper. You must help us. 

32:48.733 --> 32:52.677
Remember what he saw. Stay with me. 

32:58.727 --> 33:01.392
Are you sure that it 
was with the gun? 

33:01.990 --> 33:05.658
Saw this, Cooper. 

33:10.319 --> 33:12.826
- Gavin shot in Leslie. 
- Really? 

33:12.880 --> 33:17.220
Come on, the reinforcement will take care 
it. Why did it, Cooper? 

33:19.238 --> 33:23.790
Look, do not discuss with me. 
Just touch the way I want. 

33:23.840 --> 33:26.940
I will return to court and when, 
we get it. 

33:26.976 --> 33:28.536
Will not work. 

33:28.537 --> 33:30.690
You are the composer 
and I am the producer. 

33:30.723 --> 33:34.441
Just write and I say 
what will work. 

33:35.490 --> 33:38.632
Am I interrupting? 
He said he could enter. 

33:38.679 --> 33:41.710
I thought that would in court. 

33:41.759 --> 33:43.628
Change of plans. 

33:43.629 --> 33:47.330
A neighbor saw the window 
Leslie coming with the gun, 

33:55.820 --> 33:57.992
the two fighting it, 
until you got 

33:58.015 --> 34:01.484
and threw well in 
middle of the rack, 

34:03.740 --> 34:05.952
and deploy the weapon in her hand. 

34:05.986 --> 34:09.525
His bail was revoked. 
You come with me. 

34:41.839 --> 34:45.577
- Hi, I received your message. 
- Hello Thank you for moving here. 

34:45.605 --> 34:47.605
Sure. What is he saying? 

34:47.614 --> 34:50.221
You are confused. 
Talking about you. 

34:50.243 --> 34:53.398
- Speaking his name. 
- I think he knows me. 

34:53.428 --> 34:57.696
Yeah. Where to stay 
it a bit would help. 

34:59.238 --> 35:01.579
- Sure. 
- Thanks. 

35:07.420 --> 35:10.428
Oi. 

35:13.425 --> 35:17.432
Toby. I forgot. 

35:17.453 --> 35:19.700
Reminded of what? 

35:22.016 --> 35:25.936
You are the son of Maya. 

35:25.997 --> 35:30.758
You have the gift, 
as she was. 

35:36.008 --> 35:39.973
Come on, Maya, it's time. 

35:42.903 --> 35:45.546
I mean, my mother. 

35:45.640 --> 35:50.386
- Mom? 
- Maya. I was speaking it. 

35:50.650 --> 35:54.779
Maya. 
I remember. 

35:59.741 --> 36:04.227
- You were taking us. 
- Maya changed his name. 

36:04.269 --> 36:08.704
Yes To take us where? 

36:11.386 --> 36:14.122
What is your name? 

36:19.331 --> 36:24.389
Do not worry, William. 
Everything will be fine. 

36:26.342 --> 36:31.543
William. 
My name is William. 

36:32.716 --> 36:35.497
William. 

36:36.870 --> 36:39.797
You know me. 

36:40.271 --> 36:43.417
I know you. 

36:45.890 --> 36:48.023
Thank you.
