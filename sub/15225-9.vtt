01:20.067 --> 01:21.868
Yes. Yes, Mr. McKenzie.

01:21.901 --> 01:23.868
Oh, yes. I understand, sir.

01:23.901 --> 01:25.234
Certainly.

01:25.267 --> 01:27.968
When your wife comes in,
tell her you're not here.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.367
Yeah. Very good, sir.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.367
Oh, uh, by the way, uh, Mr.
McKenzie, have I ever told you

01:33.400 --> 01:38.334
that you have
a magnificent telephone voice?

01:38.367 --> 01:42.901
Uh, well, have I told you today?

01:42.934 --> 01:44.701
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

01:44.734 --> 01:46.067
I'm sorry.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.400
I was under the impression
you <i>liked</i> it kissed.

01:50.434 --> 01:51.601
Bye-bye.

01:51.634 --> 01:52.601
Oh, hi, Elaine.

01:52.634 --> 01:53.634
Hi.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.367
Hey, listen, I got
a couple new exercises

01:55.400 --> 01:56.467
in that class I'm taking.

01:56.501 --> 01:57.734
Oh, the pantomime class.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.501
Yeah, you know, this mime
stuff, it's really helping me

02:00.534 --> 02:02.400
in my, in my stage
presence, you know?

02:02.434 --> 02:04.167
You want to see
a couple exercises?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.167
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.767
Now, this is called
"Man Walking."

02:11.267 --> 02:12.767
That's a
man walking,
all right.

02:12.801 --> 02:13.767
Yeah? Yeah?

02:13.801 --> 02:15.267
Hey, I got one.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.801
Okay.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.834
Tony, what is that
supposed to be?

02:22.868 --> 02:25.767
That's "A Man
Standing in Garage."

02:25.801 --> 02:29.367
No, that's "Dumb Man
Standing in the Garage."

02:29.400 --> 02:31.267
I love this.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.434
A duel of wits
between unarmed opponents.

02:34.467 --> 02:36.667
BOBBY:
Hey, Elaine,
you want to see

02:36.701 --> 02:37.934
some more?
Want to see another one?

02:37.968 --> 02:39.868
Oh, yeah, yeah,
come on.
Okay, this is a classic.

02:39.901 --> 02:42.400
This is called
"Man in Glass Cubicle." Okay?

03:07.767 --> 03:09.801
When did they
put that in here?

03:12.467 --> 03:14.434
No, no, no. Jim, uh,
this is pantomime.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.200
It's just an exercise from
Bobby's acting class.

03:17.234 --> 03:18.901
Oh... I see.

03:18.934 --> 03:21.834
Can he hear us in there?

03:24.334 --> 03:26.567
Ignatowski, why
don't you try

03:26.601 --> 03:30.033
renting out that vacant
lot between your ears?

03:30.067 --> 03:31.334
Okeydoke.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.934
M-Mrs. McKenzie.

03:43.801 --> 03:45.767
( <i>slamming thud</i> )

03:45.801 --> 03:48.234
( <i>nervous laughter</i> )

03:48.267 --> 03:50.701
Don't you look lovely today?

03:50.734 --> 03:52.300
Thank you, Louie.

03:52.334 --> 03:55.701
Eh... thank <i>you.</i> Thank you
for coming into the garage

03:55.734 --> 03:57.901
and brightening up my day.

03:57.934 --> 04:00.033
Is my husband in?

04:00.067 --> 04:01.968
Uh... Mr. McKenzie?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.968
Uh, no, no, no. I'm
afraid, I'm afraid

04:04.000 --> 04:05.467
that you, uh,
you just missed him.

04:05.501 --> 04:07.467
Uh, as a matter of fact,
he just left here

04:07.501 --> 04:09.300
with a couple
of business associates...

04:09.334 --> 04:11.501
Louie, if I find out
that you're lying

04:11.534 --> 04:13.167
I'm gonna roll
up your tongue

04:13.200 --> 04:15.300
and stick a toothpick
through it.

04:15.334 --> 04:18.100
( <i>stammers</i> ):
What was the question again?

04:18.132 --> 04:21.067
Is my husband in?

04:21.100 --> 04:24.067
( <i>chuckles</i> )
Oh, <i>your</i> husband's in.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.501
Yeah! I-I-I-I lost my head.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.734
Uh, would you like me
to call him

04:28.767 --> 04:30.667
and tell him
you're coming up?

04:30.701 --> 04:34.367
No. I want to surprise him.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.901
See, if he knew I was here,
that bloated gasbag

04:36.934 --> 04:38.968
would be escaping
out the back window.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.400
Well-well, I think I speak
for the rest of us

04:42.434 --> 04:46.534
when I say I hope that you
and that bloated gasbag

04:46.567 --> 04:49.334
patch up that little tiff
you're having.

04:49.367 --> 04:50.300
Ooh, ha-ha!

04:50.334 --> 04:52.701
Ooh, boy!

04:52.734 --> 04:54.033
( <i>cackles</i> )

04:55.167 --> 04:57.100
What's so funny, Louie?

04:57.133 --> 04:59.634
It's happening again.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.834
"Mrs. McKenzie's revenge."

05:01.868 --> 05:03.534
Oh...

05:03.567 --> 05:06.868
I picked up a touch of that
in Mexico one summer.

05:06.901 --> 05:08.868
Shut up.

05:08.901 --> 05:10.434
Now, listen here.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.534
I'm going to tell you a story

05:11.567 --> 05:12.834
that I think you're
going to like.

05:12.868 --> 05:16.634
It doesn't happen very often,
but every now and then

05:16.667 --> 05:19.667
Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie
have a fight

05:19.701 --> 05:22.334
and they go at it
hammer and tong,

05:22.367 --> 05:23.834
as you can well imagine.

05:23.868 --> 05:27.767
Well, as soon as it's over,
she comes out of that door

05:27.801 --> 05:29.767
swoops down here

05:29.801 --> 05:33.000
and picks out some poor,
unsuspecting cabby

05:33.033 --> 05:36.200
and invites him home to dinner.

05:36.234 --> 05:37.701
Oh, my God.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.834
That's the most horrifying
story I've ever heard.

05:39.868 --> 05:42.000
Shut up, will you?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.000
All right, it's not dinner

05:44.033 --> 05:47.667
that she wants
to take him home for.

05:47.701 --> 05:50.334
What she's really
interested in

05:50.367 --> 05:52.767
is a little mattress magic.

05:52.801 --> 05:54.834
( <i>imitating</i>
 <i>mattress squeaking</i> )

05:56.701 --> 05:58.701
Come on.

05:58.734 --> 05:59.968
Louie, this sounds like

06:00.000 --> 06:02.701
one of your little
sweaty fantasies.

06:02.734 --> 06:04.033
( <i>Louie chuckles</i> )

06:04.067 --> 06:05.734
I mean, why would
she pick a cabby?

06:05.767 --> 06:08.000
Well, she wants to
humiliate her husband.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.701
And what better
way to do that

06:09.734 --> 06:12.300
than to fool around with
one of his employees?

06:12.334 --> 06:14.467
But wait a minute, you haven't
heard the worst part yet.

06:14.501 --> 06:16.934
Once she's done
with the poor jerk

06:16.968 --> 06:20.200
she goes right to her
husband and tells him.

06:20.234 --> 06:22.701
As soon as McKenzie
hears about it

06:22.734 --> 06:26.033
it's bye-bye to that dumb cabby.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.601
You mean the guy loses his job?

06:27.634 --> 06:29.234
No.

06:29.267 --> 06:30.934
I mean...

06:30.968 --> 06:33.000
he vanishes.

06:33.033 --> 06:35.000
( <i>imitates whooshing</i> )

06:35.033 --> 06:37.300
Like he was never born.

06:37.334 --> 06:39.934
I can't even find
his records the next day.

06:39.968 --> 06:42.200
All a guy has to do
is turn her down.

06:42.234 --> 06:43.501
No, no, no, no, no.

06:43.534 --> 06:44.834
Not with this dame.

06:44.868 --> 06:47.234
I mean, with her,
even if you don't,

06:47.267 --> 06:48.767
she tells her husband you did.

06:48.801 --> 06:51.434
Either way, you're
history. ( <i>grunts</i> )

06:51.467 --> 06:53.133
I don't believe this, Louie.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.634
Well, you better
believe it, Banta,

06:55.667 --> 06:58.534
because she always picks
the young, good-looking ones.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.400
( <i>chuckles</i> )

07:00.434 --> 07:02.667
The way I figure it,
either you

07:02.701 --> 07:05.067
or Wheeler
are doomed.

07:05.100 --> 07:09.133
I'm hoping she notices
Wheeler's got the better nose.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.801
You know, Louie, I hate to
deprive you of your pleasure,

07:11.834 --> 07:13.634
but I'm not buying
any of this.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.701
Oh, no?
No.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.834
Well, neither did
Curly Melnick.

07:16.868 --> 07:19.000
He scoffed at me, too.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.133
And the last time
I saw Curly,

07:21.167 --> 07:24.801
he was walking out that door,
wearing his best suit

07:24.834 --> 07:27.033
on his way
to Mrs. McKenzie's.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.634
( <i>chuckles</i> )
But don't feel bad.

07:29.667 --> 07:33.167
It must have been worth it,
because I hear he died

07:33.200 --> 07:36.667
with a smile on what
was left of his face.

07:36.701 --> 07:38.434
( <i>chuckles</i> )

07:39.567 --> 07:41.534
Elaine, could this
be true?
I don't know...

07:41.567 --> 07:43.400
I don't think so.
Tony, this is
Louie talking.

07:43.434 --> 07:44.667
Don't take anything
seriously.

07:44.701 --> 07:45.667
ELAINE:
Yeah, of course.

07:45.701 --> 07:47.534
Oh, boy, am I tired.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.467
I've never been so tired
in all my life.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.734
I just drove a double shift,

07:52.767 --> 07:54.701
and I'm dead on my feet.

07:54.734 --> 07:55.701
( <i>yawns</i> )

07:55.734 --> 07:57.000
Hey, Alex
would know.

07:57.033 --> 07:58.734
Alex would know
about this.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.334
Oh, yeah.
Hey, hey, Alex?

08:00.367 --> 08:02.033
Yo.
Louie's been trying
to scare us

08:02.067 --> 08:04.601
with some crazy story
about Mrs. McKenzie's revenge

08:04.634 --> 08:06.167
and Curly Melnick.
Is that true?

08:06.200 --> 08:09.234
 MRS. McKENZIE:
We'll just see about that,
you wart head!

08:09.267 --> 08:10.567
( <i>door slams</i> )

09:05.400 --> 09:09.334
Uh... Mrs. McKenzie?

09:09.367 --> 09:12.100
Would you, uh, like
me to introduce you

09:12.133 --> 09:15.501
to one of these
handsome young gentlemen?

09:17.167 --> 09:19.167
Well, you could tell me
one thing, Louie.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.734
What's that?

09:20.767 --> 09:24.567
Well, I'm-I'm planning
this little dinner party for two

09:24.601 --> 09:26.367
tonight at my place.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
Oh, how delightful.

09:29.801 --> 09:31.968
I was wondering, could you come?

09:36.767 --> 09:39.501
Make it about 8:00, okay?

09:39.534 --> 09:42.067
( <i>garbled muttering</i> )

09:42.100 --> 09:43.567
Mrs...

09:43.601 --> 09:45.701
Wh...

09:45.734 --> 09:47.868
Why-Why me, Mrs. McKenzie?

09:49.801 --> 09:54.334
Because if my fooling around
with somebody halfway decent

09:54.367 --> 09:56.934
upsets my husband...

09:56.968 --> 09:58.701
this'll kill him.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.901
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

10:18.934 --> 10:20.133
( <i>mutters</i> )

10:20.167 --> 10:22.901
( <i>ringing continues</i> )

10:22.934 --> 10:24.567
( <i>mutters</i> )

10:31.901 --> 10:33.567
Hello?

10:33.601 --> 10:34.968
No, there's no Sheila here.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.901
You got the wrong number.

10:36.934 --> 10:38.400
What?

10:38.434 --> 10:40.400
Yes, of course it's my number.

10:40.434 --> 10:42.100
There's no Sheila here.

10:42.133 --> 10:44.734
What?

10:44.767 --> 10:45.901
Yes...

10:45.934 --> 10:48.868
Of course I know...

10:48.901 --> 10:50.234
Look, I...

10:50.267 --> 10:52.934
I'm telling you,
you got the wrong n...

10:52.968 --> 10:55.234
There never has been
a Sheila here.

10:55.267 --> 10:56.767
Look, I'm very sorry,

10:56.801 --> 10:59.100
but I really have
to get some sleep.

10:59.133 --> 11:02.367
Look, there doesn't have
to be a Sheila... hold on.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.534
Hey, Sheila!

11:03.567 --> 11:05.100
( <i>high-pitched voice</i> ):
Yeah?

11:05.133 --> 11:06.868
( <i>normal voice</i> ):
You want to talk to Joyce?

11:06.901 --> 11:07.868
( <i>high-pitched</i> ):
Who?

11:07.901 --> 11:09.200
( <i>normal</i> ):
Joyce.

11:09.234 --> 11:10.834
( <i>high-pitched</i> ):
Oh, tell her I'm busy.

11:10.868 --> 11:12.267
I can't talk to her...

11:12.300 --> 11:14.434
( <i>normal</i> ):
She's busy.
She'll call you later.

11:22.567 --> 11:25.100
( <i>muttering</i> )

11:25.133 --> 11:27.033
( <i>door opening</i> )

11:28.434 --> 11:30.667
Rieger!

11:30.701 --> 11:31.767
Rieger!
Hmm?

11:31.801 --> 11:33.267
Rieger, Rieger!

11:33.300 --> 11:35.367
Rieger, wake up,
wake up! Wake up!

11:35.400 --> 11:36.634
Sheila?

11:36.667 --> 11:38.834
I-I didn't want to...
I didn't want to wake you

11:38.868 --> 11:40.934
with a phone call in the middle
of the night,

11:40.968 --> 11:42.734
'cause I know how jarring
that can be.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.868
That's very thoughtful.
How did you get in?

11:44.901 --> 11:45.934
It wasn't easy.
Hmm...

11:45.968 --> 11:48.200
I-I-I tried to pick the lock,
but it was too tough.

11:48.234 --> 11:49.868
Oh, that's nice to know.

11:49.901 --> 11:51.300
So I had to break it.
Mm-hmm.

11:51.334 --> 11:54.000
I-I knew if I knocked,
you wouldn't have let me in.

11:54.033 --> 11:55.501
You're right.
Come on, Rieger.

11:55.534 --> 11:57.734
Rieger, look at me.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.701
Look at me, Rieger.
I'm a mess.

11:59.734 --> 12:01.534
You know why I look this way?

12:01.567 --> 12:04.934
Yeah. Genetics.

12:04.968 --> 12:06.000
No, no.

12:06.033 --> 12:07.901
I've been drinking, Rieger.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.834
Oh, I see.
You know why
I've been drinking?

12:09.868 --> 12:11.834
I don't know and I
don't care, Louie.

12:11.868 --> 12:15.000
I've been drinking
because I'm facing death.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.501
Oh, come on, Louie.

12:16.534 --> 12:18.501
What are you
talking about?

12:18.534 --> 12:21.868
Mrs. McKenzie
picked me this time.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.367
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:28.033 --> 12:30.801
Now this might be
worth waking up for.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.400
Rieger, I'm trapped.

12:32.434 --> 12:34.467
I'm cursed. I'm doomed.

12:34.501 --> 12:35.901
Oh, come on, Louie.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.067
There must be some mistake.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.734
Why would she pick you?

12:38.767 --> 12:41.834
Come on, admit it--
you're no Curly Melnick.

12:41.868 --> 12:43.601
Then again,
neither is he anymore.

12:43.634 --> 12:44.601
Rieger...

12:44.634 --> 12:46.767
she picked me
because she really wants

12:46.801 --> 12:48.901
to rub her husband's
nose in it this time.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.234
Ah, that's a good choice.

12:51.267 --> 12:52.467
Come on, Rieger,
you got to help me.

12:52.501 --> 12:53.567
You got to help me.
All right.

12:53.601 --> 12:55.634
You help everybody else
in the garage.

12:55.667 --> 12:56.734
You got to help me.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.400
I know I help
everybody else,

12:58.434 --> 13:01.000
because they're
nice people and
deserving of help.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.167
( <i>imitates bawling</i> )

13:02.200 --> 13:04.501
"They're nice people

13:04.534 --> 13:06.868
If I wasn't about to die,
I'd be sick.

( <i>sighs</i> )

13:08.334 --> 13:09.767
Rieger!
( <i>snores</i> )

13:09.801 --> 13:12.968
Mrs. McKenzie wants my goodies.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.868
What am I going to do?

13:14.901 --> 13:16.367
Come on.
( <i>mutters groggily</i> )

13:16.400 --> 13:17.934
Rieger! Rieger,
Rieger, Rieger!
Hmm?

13:17.968 --> 13:19.868
All right, all right.
All right, all right.

13:19.901 --> 13:22.033
All right, all right.
Let's take a look
at your problem.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.367
All right.
Great, great.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.534
Let us examine
your options.

13:25.567 --> 13:26.534
My options.

13:26.567 --> 13:27.534
Options, yeah!

13:27.567 --> 13:29.567
I love how you do this.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.367
I got it.
What? What?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.601
You call her up,
tell her you're sick,
you can't make it.

13:33.634 --> 13:36.467
Genius! The man is a genius!

13:36.501 --> 13:37.634
No, wait, wait, wait!

13:37.667 --> 13:39.033
That won't work.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.133
She saw you in the pink
of health

13:40.167 --> 13:41.467
this morning.
She'll never believe it.

13:41.501 --> 13:43.868
Not for a second.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.200
What? What?

13:48.234 --> 13:49.634
What? What?

13:49.667 --> 13:51.801
I got it!
Hmm? What?
What? You got it?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.801
You jump the gun.
You go to Mr. McKenzie himself,

13:53.834 --> 13:54.834
and tell him everything.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.334
That's it!

13:56.367 --> 13:58.367
That is it!
( <i>raucous laughter</i> )

13:59.934 --> 14:01.801
Wait, wait a minute!

14:01.834 --> 14:03.467
That won't work, either.

14:03.501 --> 14:05.200
It won't?
No, he'll kill
you right there

14:05.234 --> 14:07.367
in his office for telling
stories about his wife.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.367
He'd tear me limb from limb.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.367
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:11.434 --> 14:12.701
I don't know...

14:12.734 --> 14:14.567
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

14:14.601 --> 14:16.033
Come on. Come on.
Think. Think.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.033
Wait a minute!

14:17.067 --> 14:18.367
Whoo!

14:18.400 --> 14:20.300
Why didn't I
think of this before?

14:20.334 --> 14:22.200
( <i>laughs</i> )
Why didn't you
think of it?

14:22.234 --> 14:25.667
She picked you because you're
loathsome and despicable, right?

14:25.701 --> 14:26.934
Right!
So, all we got to do

14:26.968 --> 14:29.033
is find someone more loathsome
and more despicable.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.167
Ahhhh!
( <i>growling</i> )

14:35.234 --> 14:36.567
Louie, there is one answer.

14:36.601 --> 14:37.601
What, what, what?

14:37.634 --> 14:38.801
You're a dead man.

14:40.634 --> 14:43.100
No, no. Rieger, Rieger.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.434
Bye-bye.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.067
Oh, no. Oh, no.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.067
No, no, I'm not finished,
Rieger.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.734
Oh, no, no, no.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.834
Louie De Palma is a survivor.

14:53.868 --> 14:57.167
I'm going to come out of this
thing, you bet. ( <i>grunts</i> )

14:57.200 --> 15:00.534
Who was it that said,
"I shall return"?

15:03.567 --> 15:05.200
Curly Melnick.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.534
( <i>groaning</i> )

15:12.968 --> 15:15.968
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

15:30.067 --> 15:31.634
Now, look here,
Mrs. McKenzie.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.133
I thought about this a lot,

15:33.167 --> 15:35.767
and I want to get
one thing straight right now.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.701
There is no way
in the world

15:37.734 --> 15:39.434
that you are going
to seduce me.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.067
I want you!

15:50.234 --> 15:52.667
Come in, Louie.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.234
What am I doing?

15:54.267 --> 15:56.133
This is crazy.
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

15:56.167 --> 15:57.934
I... I don't think
there's any reason

15:57.968 --> 15:59.901
for us to beat
around the bush.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.267
I mean, there is no
chance of anything

16:02.300 --> 16:04.033
happening between
you and I.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.667
I mean, look at it from my side.

16:06.701 --> 16:10.501
I have nothing but loyalty
for my employer, Mr. McKenzie,

16:10.534 --> 16:13.801
who happens to be
one of the finest human beings

16:13.834 --> 16:17.267
who it has been my pleasure
to meet in this life.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.701
He can't stand the sight of you.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.868
Then I'll have his woman.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.467
This is crazy, no!

16:30.501 --> 16:32.000
Mrs. McKenzie,
you don't want me.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.300
Oh, yes, I do.

16:33.334 --> 16:34.367
Oh, no, no.

16:35.534 --> 16:37.000
No, listen, you
only picked me

16:37.033 --> 16:39.133
because I was at the
bottom of the barrel.

16:39.167 --> 16:42.534
Oh, Louie, that's not true.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.767
No, I-I find you
very attractive.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.200
You do?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.167
Yes.

17:04.867 --> 17:08.800
Well... what do you find
attractive about me?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.634
Your eyes.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.467
You have nice eyes.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.901
Both of them?

17:49.133 --> 17:51.167
( <i>mutters</i> ):
No, Mrs. McKenzie.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.200
There is no way that your
mere kisses are going to...

17:54.234 --> 17:55.567
sway me.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.767
What is that scent?

18:08.801 --> 18:11.100
That's "Pleasuree."

18:11.133 --> 18:12.167
Pl...

18:12.200 --> 18:13.334
Pleasuree.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.834
It's very expensive.

18:15.868 --> 18:18.334
Oh, it should be.

18:18.367 --> 18:21.033
Poor people shouldn't
smell like that.

18:29.701 --> 18:31.501
Let's go into the bedroom.

18:31.534 --> 18:34.267
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.167
No, Mrs. McKenzie, please.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.033
Please don't make me
go in there, please.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.834
Please...

Louie...

18:46.901 --> 18:48.367
Please...

18:48.400 --> 18:50.901
Your palms are getting
little sweat marks

18:50.934 --> 18:52.901
all over my gown.

18:56.601 --> 18:58.868
Are you going to come
into the bedroom with me?

18:58.901 --> 19:01.767
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh-ho-ho, no!

19:01.801 --> 19:04.300
Oh, no. You don't get me
in there.

19:04.334 --> 19:06.300
No, sirree. Oh, no.

19:06.334 --> 19:09.300
Because I know
if I stay out here, I'm safe.

19:09.334 --> 19:12.067
Once I get in there,
I'm a dead man.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.534
But I'm not coming hither.

19:48.567 --> 19:51.367
No, thank you, Mrs. McKenzie.

Okay, Louie,
if that's how you feel.

20:24.634 --> 20:26.234
I've reconsidered.

No.

No, we mustn't.
Why not?

20:50.767 --> 20:51.734
We'll regret it.

No, we won't.

It's morally wrong.

We can't do this,

Oh, yes, we can.

No, no, I have

What?

I have a war wound.

Really?
Yes.

What war?
Yeah.

I can't remember.
I had my memory

23:17.133 --> 23:19.701
Hey, Bobby, you want to go
have a drink at Mario's?

23:19.734 --> 23:21.100
Uh, no, man, I
got a mime class.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.400
I've got to practice
some exercises.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.901
I'll see you later, okay?

23:23.934 --> 23:25.434
Catch you later.
Okay.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.634
( <i>sighs</i> )

23:58.734 --> 24:00.868
Oh, wait a minute.

24:00.901 --> 24:02.133
Huh!

24:02.167 --> 24:04.467
I see what's
going on here.

24:04.501 --> 24:06.834
This is mime stuff, right?

24:06.868 --> 24:09.000
Hey! Right, Jim.

24:09.033 --> 24:13.734
I may be slow,
but once I catch it, it sticks.

24:13.767 --> 24:15.200
Well, see you tomorrow.

24:15.234 --> 24:16.234
Okay.

24:22.767 --> 24:24.200
Bobby, when the hell

24:24.234 --> 24:26.734
are you going to get
this thing out of here?

24:29.367 --> 24:32.133
Uh, I got some people
coming to pick it up
in the morning, Jim.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.434
Yeah, it's getting
to be an eyesore.

24:40.434 --> 24:44.167

Night, Mr. Walters.
