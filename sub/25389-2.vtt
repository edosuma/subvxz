00:01.400 --> 00:04.198
CAMILA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.230 --> 00:05.788
Don't let our daughter
become you.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.195
CAMILA: Don't.
-(grunts)

00:07.240 --> 00:09.208
I want that bitch dead
just as much as you do.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.798
Isabela, don't talk like that.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.307
TERESA: After our shipment
comes in,

00:12.340 --> 00:13.898
we'll have too much cash
to run With.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.703
Oleg promised me a meeting
with the banker,

00:15.740 --> 00:17.640
Rocco de la Pea,
who can help us launder it.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.309
And for all my magic tricks,
I charge 5%.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.181
Today I'm moving
30 kilos a week.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.983
Do you want to wait
until I've doubled that

00:25.020 --> 00:27.215
-to negotiate with me?
-Four points it is.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.080
BOAZ: It's my business now.
The only reason I'm giving you

00:29.130 --> 00:31.325
a cut is because Epifanio
was a gentleman.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.191
You're not giving me anything.

00:33.230 --> 00:36.358
I'm receiving a part of the cut
because I am the governor.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.925
Devon, I need your help
to get the coke.

00:38.970 --> 00:40.494
DEVON: The product has been
delivered in full.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.939
James arranged it.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.268
I have an offer to make.
Come work with us.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.607
Ah.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.677
We need their permission
to move on Boaz.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.769
I want your focus on Teresa.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.949
Put all your sicarios
on the ground in Valleta.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.447
CAMILA: I want blood.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.209
(explosion)

00:56.250 --> 00:57.683
(tense music)

00:57.720 --> 00:59.779
(tires squealing)

00:59.820 --> 01:01.959
Get in the car.
Now!

01:01.990 --> 01:03.924
*

01:03.960 --> 01:05.427
(knocking)

01:05.460 --> 01:08.020
MARK: Hey, come on in, buddy.
(laughs)

01:08.060 --> 01:09.391
He's here, honey.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.625
Honey, this is Trevor.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.035
Pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Douglas.

01:13.070 --> 01:14.594
Oh, call me Diane.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.868
So good to finally meet you.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.367
Ever since you started
at the plant,

01:17.410 --> 01:19.401
all I hear about is
Trevor this and Trevor that.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.600
Tell you the truth,
I was starting

01:20.640 --> 01:22.301
to get a little jealous.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.045
(laughs) Well, down at
the plant, all we ever hear

01:24.080 --> 01:25.274
is how luclq this guy is
to have you.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.073
(chuckles)
You're sweet.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.281
Well, I hope you brought your
appetite with these flowers.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.618
-Yes, ma'am.
MARK: Come on in.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.153
Lord, we'd like to give thanks
for our meal

01:34.190 --> 01:36.158
and for everyone gathered here.

01:36.190 --> 01:39.057
We ask that You provide for all
those less fortunate than us.

01:39.090 --> 01:42.821
And we ask that You bless this
food and our time together,

01:42.870 --> 01:44.667
in Jesus' name.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.395
ALL: Amen.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.499
Looks beautiful.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.405
So, Trevor,

01:50.440 --> 01:53.238
Mark tells me you used to work
for a commodities broker.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.235
That's right.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.168
That sounds exciting.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.508
Commodity training.
What's that like?

01:58.550 --> 02:00.245
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

02:00.280 --> 02:01.440
(macaw caws)

02:04.450 --> 02:05.781
(grunts)

02:05.820 --> 02:07.412
It's murder.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.429
Markets are volatile, and
the competition's cutthroat.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.348
MARK:
Sounds like manufacturing.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.958
At the end of the day,
it's all down

02:14.000 --> 02:15.956
-to supply and demand, right?
-That's right.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.628
DIANE: So tell us_about
your family. Any snbllngs?

02:18.670 --> 02:21.298
I had a little sister, but she
passed away when we were young.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.537
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:24.570 --> 02:28.176
What about your folks?
Are they still with us?

02:28.210 --> 02:30.007
It's just me.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.617
Well, you should know that
everyone who sits at this table

02:33.650 --> 02:35.777
is considered family.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.448
Ladies,
why don't we show Trevor

02:38.490 --> 02:40.458
how we welcome family
around this house?

02:40.490 --> 02:41.684
I'll do it.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.483
MARK: All right,
thank you, Suzie.

02:44.930 --> 02:47.398
* This little light of mine

02:47.430 --> 02:50.069

-Not now.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.669
Where are they?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.540
I don't know.
I can't see them.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.478
Then maybe we lost them.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.512
(engines rewing)

03:15.560 --> 03:18.654
*

03:18.690 --> 03:19.691

Diga.

TERESA (over phone): Pote.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.628
WOMAN: (gasps, grunts)

04:01.670 --> 04:03.137
What's wrong?
Are you all right?

04:03.170 --> 04:04.467
They found us.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.102
POTE: Where are you?

04:06.140 --> 04:08.028
-I'll come to you.
TERESA: No, there's no time.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.377
JAMES: Hold on.
-Who's that?

04:09.410 --> 04:10.604
TERESA: I can't explain now.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.311
Meet me
at the safe house, okay?

04:12.350 --> 04:13.908
Teresita . ..

04:16.120 --> 04:17.212

Give me your gun.
Hurry.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.438
I just saved your life.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.185
You want to save yours?

*

05:50.950 --> 05:53.748
Very impressive, Gobernadora.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.008
When we're up and running,

05:55.050 --> 05:57.587
we're gonna house
over 200 orphans.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.316
A worthy tribute
to Epifanio.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.214
Yes.

06:02.260 --> 06:05.149
But is it enough
to silence our detractors?

06:05.190 --> 06:06.555
It's a first step.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.160
Second is to capture
Epifanio's killer.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.998
We have her in our sights
in Malta.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.339
My men are closing in
as we speak.

06:14.370 --> 06:15.997
Good.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.338
Tonight that dog is gonna
breathe her last breath.

06:18.370 --> 06:20.509
And tomorrow we'll celebrate

06:20.540 --> 06:22.440
with the opening
of the orphanage.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.869
Yes, well, I suggest
we await confirmation

06:24.910 --> 06:25.945
before celebrating.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.242
CAMILA: We await nothing.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.215
If she's in Malta,
it's already done.

*

06:52.070 --> 06:53.537
TERESA: How did you find me?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.933
Would you mind pointing that
somewhere else?

06:54.980 --> 06:57.744
Answer the question.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.145
There's a contract out

06:59.180 --> 07:00.818
on someone they call
"La Princesa."

07:00.850 --> 07:02.818
I did some digging,
found out this princess

07:02.850 --> 07:04.386
is moving
Bolivian coke.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.650
So I followed the sicarios
hoping to help.

07:06.690 --> 07:07.952
-That's bullshit.
-It's the truth.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.184
Why would you do that?

07:10.330 --> 07:13.788
The last time we met,
you offered me a partnership.

07:13.830 --> 07:15.195
And you tried to kill me.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.125
IfI really wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.535
You know that.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.102
Are you working for Camila?

07:23.140 --> 07:25.404
-Parted ways a while back.
-Answer the question.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.772
No, I'm not working for Camila.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.075
I know you have another gun.
Give it to me.

07:32.110 --> 07:39.118
*

07:40.820 --> 07:42.014
Get out of the car.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.687
-What are you doing?
-Do it slowly.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.027
Get out.

07:46.060 --> 07:52.693
*

07:52.740 --> 07:54.298
Open the trunk.

07:54.340 --> 08:01.337
*

08:04.480 --> 08:06.448
Those are not for you.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.368
Who, then?

08:08.420 --> 08:11.218
I figured I had to subdue Pote
just to get a word in with you.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.457
Get a zip tie.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.378
(groans)

08:17.260 --> 08:21.299
-Tie yourself up.
-(sighs) Teresa.

08:21.330 --> 08:28.236
*

08:28.270 --> 08:30.204
Get in.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.037
It's not smart.
There are people after--

08:32.070 --> 08:33.935

08:35.440 --> 08:36.668
(cheers and applause)

08:36.710 --> 08:39.679

08:39.720 --> 08:41.210

Playing)

08:41.250 --> 08:42.717
(speaking Spanish)

08:42.750 --> 08:46.413
(bull bellows)

08:46.450 --> 08:49.157
BOAZ: Yeah!

08:49.190 --> 08:50.282
Whoo!

08:53.700 --> 08:55.452
(audience gasps)

08:57.370 --> 08:59.998
That's what a campen
looks like.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.907
I've always admired
the courage of the matador.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.567
Matador?

09:04.610 --> 09:06.430
Matador?
I'm talking about the bull.

09:08.310 --> 09:09.948
And he's killed
three matadors this month.

09:09.980 --> 09:12.949
He's won me a lot of money.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.369
So what do you
want to talk about,

09:15.420 --> 09:17.718
without Camila?

09:17.750 --> 09:19.047
Heroin.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.955
I have a supplier
in Tamaulipas.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.514
Take a look around, General.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.187
This is my bullring.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.118
I don't need to mess around
with selling chiva

09:26.160 --> 09:29.095
when I wipe my ass
with $100 bills, pap.

09:29.130 --> 09:32.190
Yes, but not before
Camila takes her cut.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.767
My supplier will front us
all the heroin we need.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.802
We send it north through our
regularly scheduled shipments.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.398
I don't know.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.328
As much as I hate giving
that bitch her pinch...

09:42.750 --> 09:44.445
Did you know your familia

09:44.480 --> 09:47.210
held a private meeting
with the Colombians yesterday?

09:47.250 --> 09:49.718
Huh?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.638
They didn't mention it.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.317
And neither did she.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.453
Do you think she's trying
to move against me?

09:55.490 --> 09:57.822
Camila is like an alley cat.

09:57.860 --> 09:58.986
And you know what they say...

10:00.800 --> 10:02.995
That's why we need
to make our own moves.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.793
When the heroin business
IS up and running,

10:04.830 --> 10:06.969
we won't need her or Reynaldo.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.232

10:11.270 --> 10:12.259
Hmm.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.679
As, Gobernadora?

10:26.720 --> 10:28.187
Gracias.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.393
Is that...

10:36.730 --> 10:39.119
(chuckles)
Pablito.

10:39.170 --> 10:42.037
Dad gave him to me
on my fifth birthday.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.004
How'd you remember
what he looked like?

10:44.040 --> 10:46.361
I'm the one
that picked him out.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.200
I used to love that bear.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.640
I slept with him every night
until I was 12.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.218
Well, maybe now he can help
these poor children sleep,

10:57.250 --> 10:59.013
hopefully feel safe.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.479
What?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.157
Something's different
about you.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.624
You're, like,
glowing or something.

11:07.660 --> 11:09.457
I'm just excited
about the opening.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.628
(chuckles)
No, it's not that.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.092
-Tell me.
-It's nothing.

11:16.270 --> 11:18.204
You found her.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.538
You found Teresa.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.048
-Isabela.
-When is it happening?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.742
When will she get
what's coming to her?

11:25.780 --> 11:29.238
Tell me.
I have the right to know.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.646
Today.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.578
(foreboding music)

11:33.620 --> 11:34.712
Good.

We have breaking news

11:47.470 --> 11:50.598
regarding this morning's
bomb explosion in Valleta.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.234
Eyewitnesses captured
footage of suspects

11:53.280 --> 11:56.738
fleeing in a high-speed chase
that erupted in gunfire.

Are you all right?
Where are you?

12:14.260 --> 12:16.524
I'm okay.
I just got to the safe house.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.096
POTE (over phone):
I stopped by the apartment

12:18.130 --> 12:19.939
to grab our things.
How did you get away?

12:19.970 --> 12:21.767
-James.
-What?

12:21.800 --> 12:24.030
TERESA (over phone):
He's here. He helped me.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.708
Is he working for Camila?

12:25.740 --> 12:27.401
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.976
POTE: Where is he now?

12:29.010 --> 12:30.307
In the trunk.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.717
Attagirl.
I'm leaving now.

Keep him on ice
until I get there.

I am a blessed man,
indeed.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.105
Here.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.674
Speaking of which,

13:40.720 --> 13:42.813
you have been a real godsend
to the company.

13:42.850 --> 13:45.114
-Just doing my job.
-Oh, bullshit.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.959
I've been watching you.

13:46.990 --> 13:50.687
You know, Harold
is about to retire.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.459
I've got my eye on you
for his position.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.151
What?
No.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.952
There must be other people
more qualified.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.628
Hey, I believe in you, Trevor.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.889
Besides, we're family now,
right?

MARK: Of course,
of course we can.

Ah.

Yeah.

DEVON (over phone):
How we looking in Texas?

14:16.620 --> 14:18.247
JAMES (over phone):
We made a mistake.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.315
This can't be the guy
who hijacked our shipment.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.918
You're sure?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.518
JAMES: I've searched every inch
of the office,

14:23.560 --> 14:25.084
and I'm at the house now.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.496
Can't find a single thing
that connects him.

14:27.530 --> 14:29.020
It just doesn't fit.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.425
Why take a chance?

14:30.470 --> 14:31.767
Get it done.
Tonight.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.336
JAMES: Did you hear
what I said?

14:33.370 --> 14:35.065
I found nothing.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.590
DEVON: Maybe he's just good
at covering his tracks.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.528
Either way, we need
to mitigate our risks.

14:38.570 --> 14:41.004
Otherwise, everything we've
built over the last four months

14:41.040 --> 14:42.109
could be lost.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.368
I know.

14:43.410 --> 14:44.900
This one doesn't feel right.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.542
DEVON: Feeling's got
nothing to do with it.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.242
You want to run
your own outfit, get It done.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.545

this woman.

everyone's seen it.

That's why you
shouldn't be calling me.

TERESA (over phone):
The police are on their way,

23:15.290 --> 23:16.951
and I know you have people
on your payroll.

23:16.990 --> 23:20.118
If I go down, you don't collect
your commission.

you'd be losing?

-Who was that?
-Rocco de la Pea.

23:38.410 --> 23:39.968
You have a $10-million bounty
on your head,

23:40.010 --> 23:41.375
and you just gave up
our location.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.069
Don't need you to lecture me.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.486
The last time I saw you,
you were shooting at me.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.112
As I recall,
you and your merry men

23:47.150 --> 23:48.458
attacked me
at the train depot.

23:48.490 --> 23:49.809
The El Santo coke
belonged to me.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.327
And it was for me to take.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.123
No, you walked away
from the business.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.151
Camila was trying to kill me,
and you betrayed me.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.122
Uh, I didn't betray you.
I was protecting you.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.390
I didn't want your protection.
And I don't trust you.

23:59.430 --> 24:00.738
You don't trust me?

24:00.770 --> 24:02.169
You're only alive
because of me.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.565
No, I'm alive because of me.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.009
Well, that's what you think.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.837
You put a tracking device
in Tony's Gameboy

24:06.870 --> 24:09.179
and sent sicarios after me.
Do you not remember that?

24:09.210 --> 24:10.848
I tried to make Camila
let you go.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.245
That's why I wasn't
at the cabin.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.304
She didn't trust me
to kill you.

24:13.350 --> 24:14.669
Why should I believe you?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.017
JAMES:
Since the first day we met,

24:16.050 --> 24:17.586
I've been trying
to keep you alive.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.110
And whether you want
to believe it or not,

24:19.150 --> 24:21.516
I'm still trying to.
But you have to trust me.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.585
You want me to trust you?
I don't even know you.

JAMES: In Malta.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.600
They serve French bread.
They teach yoga.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.179
Are you kidding?

27:00.210 --> 27:02.246
No, I saw it on CNN.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.283
"Top ten places to do time."
Malta was number four.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.019
Who was number one?

27:09.060 --> 27:12.120
Sweden. The prisons

But I barely know you.

how you fight.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.474
And maybe that's all there is.

You can't help me.
I'm the one you want.

I'm Teresa Mendoza.
The bounty's for my head.

Sorry he couldn't let you in
on our secret earlier,

29:43.380 --> 29:45.746
but he couldn't risk
tipping his partner.

29:45.780 --> 29:48.749
Well, his ex-partner.

Teresa, you're not
out of the woods yet.

The governor of Sinaloa

You should have known

30:35.330 --> 30:37.992
there's no place on Earth
you were safe from me.

30:38.030 --> 30:40.828
When my men
are through with you,

30:40.870 --> 30:43.566
you're gonna regret
the day you were born.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.239
I only regret not killing you
along with Epifanio.

30:46.270 --> 30:49.535
CAMILA: (chuckles)
Ay, Teresita.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.741
That was always your problem.

30:51.780 --> 30:54.977
You never knew
who to trust.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.410
And there was only ever one way
for this to end for you.

TERESA: I don't understand.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.025
People like Camila
only understand

31:47.070 --> 31:50.562
the language of death
and destruction.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.568
She reached out
shortly after you.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.237
I played along to protect you.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.374
So now that I've done
what you asked for,

31:57.410 --> 32:00.379
I believe a renegotiation
of our previous terms

32:00.410 --> 32:02.640
would be in order,
hmm?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.819
You want your 5%?

32:04.850 --> 32:09.480
I think 6% would be fair,
given the circumstances.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.489
Now, can we consummate?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.896
-Yes.
-Good.

32:14.930 --> 32:16.795
But first I need to find Pote.

It's Teresa.
Ah, it's okay.

Teres--Teresita.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.498
It's okay.

35:21.950 --> 35:25.909
I'm not going any--anywhere.
(groans)

35:25.950 --> 35:27.417
Gonna get you a doctor.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.987
No, no.

-It better.

It's the most expensive
carne asada we'll ever eat.

36:33.950 --> 36:36.316
Lost his last bout.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.521
Nothing left to do
but to eat him.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.222
I have just the thing
to cheer you up.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.234
Payment for our first
load of heroin.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.443
Best part is,
no kickbacks to Camila.

Tasted just like tripas.

You think that's funny?

Wait till you taste
the pozole recipe

I've got cooked up
for Camila.

38:09.450 --> 38:11.486
How is he?

38:11.520 --> 38:12.885
Asleep for now.

38:13.890 --> 38:15.118
You all right?

38:17.790 --> 38:19.257
They tortured him
like an animal,

38:19.290 --> 38:20.882
but_he wouldn't
give me up.

38:22.530 --> 38:24.225
He knows you'd do the same.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.020
I'm not that strong.

38:28.070 --> 38:29.867
Yeah, you are.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.902
Men like Pote follow strength.

38:33.070 --> 38:35.174
You're as strong as they come.

38:35.210 --> 38:37.075
You proved that
last night.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.568
Why did you come back?

Really?

JAMES: After I split
from Camila,

38:49.590 --> 38:51.182
I was working
with Devon Finch.

38:51.220 --> 38:53.484
It was good for a while.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.896
Till someone hijacked
our shipment.

38:55.930 --> 38:58.660
I hunted down
the people responsible, but...

39:00.230 --> 39:02.869
There was one guy left
who Devon suspected.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.761
He was an outlier.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.378
I had my doubts, but...

39:10.410 --> 39:12.446
Devon wanted him
taken out.

39:14.450 --> 39:16.111
(grunts)

39:18.420 --> 39:20.308
Stop struggling.

39:20.350 --> 39:22.215
I don't want to hurt
your family.

You always said
there was a different way.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.744
But now...

I want to do things
differently.

So I'm asking you...

39:52.150 --> 39:53.708
Please, let me in.

39:56.160 --> 40:00.256
If we do this,
it's not a partnership.
