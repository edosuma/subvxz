{\an3}David, I don't know
how you eat that stuff

02:31.276 --> 02:32.402
or where you put it.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.113
Well, I'm a growing boy,
and I need the sugar rush

02:35.196 --> 02:37.574
if I'm going to get through
my first period math class.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.909
{\an4}(children's song plays)
Can you say
"sugar rush"?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.077
{\an3}Try that.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.537
Please, don't
get her started.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.746
Oh, by the way,

02:43.830 --> 02:44.414
{\an3}the real estate people
are coming today,

02:44.497 --> 02:46.374
so make your
beds, okay?

02:46.457 --> 02:47.584
{\an3}DAVID:
Sure.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.252
David, did you eat
the last banana?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.587
Yeah, I guess so.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.630
{\an4}KELLY:
Oh, that's just great.
Thank you

02:52.714 --> 02:54.299
very much. I was saving
that banana for my breakfast.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.093
{\an5}(baby crying)
What am I, a
mind reader?

02:57.176 --> 02:59.596
{\an6}JACKIE:
Don't mind
her, David.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.930
She's just getting in

03:01.014 --> 03:02.765
{\an3}the last moments
of immaturity

03:02.849 --> 03:03.308
before she turns

03:03.391 --> 03:05.435
18 years old.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.936
{\an3}DAVID:
Would you like

03:07.020 --> 03:08.688
half of my jelly donut?

03:08.771 --> 03:10.481
No, I don't want half
of your jelly donut.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.900
{\an1}(phone ringing)
I want my banana.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.610
{\an5}JACKIE:
I can make you some eggs.
Hello.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.236
I don't want eggs.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.613
I know.
You want a banana.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.115
{\an1}That's all right.
I shouldn't be eating anyway.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.284
Donna, we can't talk
about this now.

03:21.367 --> 03:21.868
{\an3}Okay. I'll
ask her.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.453
{\an3}I'll see you
at school.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.455
All right, bye.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.915
Ask me what?

03:26.998 --> 03:28.625
Oh, not you.

03:28.708 --> 03:29.918
Don't mind me.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.127
I just live here.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.670
{\an3}JACKIE:
Oh, honey, wait.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.880
About your birthday.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.300
I was thinking, um, maybe just
a small dinner tomorrow night

03:37.383 --> 03:39.427
{\an3}with the three of us,
Donna and Dylan.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.137
Whatever.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.182
{\an3}Donna wants
to know

03:44.265 --> 03:45.808
if we can throw
the party here.

03:45.892 --> 03:46.476
David, I told
you, we can't.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.436
Not with real estate brokers

03:48.519 --> 03:49.520
{\an1}and buyers in
and out all the time.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.439
{\an5}(babbling)
I know. It's
just as well.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.525
{\an3}The way she just bit my head
off, I don't even know why

03:54.609 --> 03:57.779
{\an3}we're throwing her a birthday
party in the first place.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.364
{\an1}Oh, she'll be okay.
She just woke up

03:59.447 --> 04:01.449
{\an1}on the wrong side
of the bed this morning.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.117
{\an1}Listen, you just
find a place,

04:03.201 --> 04:05.954
{\an1}and I'll pay
for whatever the party costs.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.168
(students chattering)

04:12.251 --> 04:14.379
I still don't get why
we can't do it at your house.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.714
I told you.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.882
{\an1}My mother's not going
to Santa Barbara anymore.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.343
So, she'll be there.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.346
It's not like we're playing Spin
the Bottle in the living room.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.390
David, my mother's idea of
a birthday party are six guests,

04:25.473 --> 04:27.976
{\an1}all girls,
and a birthday cake

04:28.059 --> 04:30.186
in the shape of your age.
No, thank you.

04:30.269 --> 04:31.354
So, what are we

04:31.437 --> 04:32.522
supposed to do, then?

04:32.605 --> 04:33.398
I mean, the party's tonight,
and you've already invited

04:33.481 --> 04:35.858
{\an3}half the
free world.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.360
I'll think of something.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.444
Look, just cover for me, okay?

04:42.490 --> 04:45.660
(sighs):
Oh, man.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.662
{\an1}So, how's
the writing coming?

04:47.745 --> 04:49.038
It's coming.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.666
Look, I know how hard
it is to get started.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.668
{\an1}It can be a real
struggle at first,

04:53.751 --> 04:55.503
{\an1}but I know it's going
to be great.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.130
{\an3}No, I mean, it's
really coming.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.214
Really?
Yeah.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.217
{\an3}Once I get to typing, I
just can't stop, you know?

05:01.300 --> 05:03.594
{\an3}I just keep doing it and
doing it and doing it.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.680
{\an4}Whoa. We should all
have it so tough.
Yeah.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.849
Listen, you guys,
we have a slight problem with

05:07.932 --> 05:08.558
Kelly's party--
like, no place to have it.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.559
{\an3}DYLAN:
Good.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.853
I hate surprise parties.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.230
It's like having a job interview
on your birthday.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.523
{\an4}Yeah, when have you ever had
a job interview?
(laughs)

05:15.606 --> 05:17.442
Look, you guys,
why don't we just do it

05:17.525 --> 05:20.278
at the Peach Pit,
like we first thought of?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.863
{\an6}Well, there's always
the Walshes.
Bad idea.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.072
Hi, guys.
Kel.

05:23.156 --> 05:23.573
{\an3}Hi. How
you doing?

05:23.656 --> 05:27.076
Fine.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.997
I, uh... I got to get
to AP English.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.415
I'll see ya.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.584
Yeah. Me, too.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.585
Bye.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.171
{\an1}So, uh, have you
seen Brenda?

05:38.254 --> 05:38.963
No.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.216
{\an1}Oh, well, I have
to go find her. Bye.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.426
(laughs)

05:43.509 --> 05:44.510
Something I said?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.640
{\an4}STEVE:
Brandon,
you promised me.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.060
{\an1}Come on, I told
the producers we'd be there.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.811
{\an1}And it's a favor
for my mom.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.438
{\an3}Steve, it's just
not my thing, okay?

05:55.521 --> 05:58.441
Since when are gorgeous girls
not your thing?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.984
{\an1}Brandon,
we made the cut.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.611
{\an1}We've already been
accepted as contestants.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.571
Look, I just don't
want to meet girls

06:03.654 --> 06:05.448
{\an1}on a game show called
<i>Love At First Sight,</i> okay?

06:05.531 --> 06:06.657
{\an1}BRENDA:
Better do it, Brandon.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.618
May be your
last chance

06:08.701 --> 06:10.078
to get a date this year.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.037
{\an3}Oh, yeah?
And when was

06:11.120 --> 06:12.538
{\an3}the last time you went
out on a date, huh?

06:12.622 --> 06:15.958
Hi, guys. Bye, guys.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.627
{\an1}Brandon,

06:17.710 --> 06:20.129
{\an1}these are going
to be the most awesome girls

06:20.213 --> 06:22.256
we have ever seen.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.134
{\an1}Each and every one of them
have been hand-picked

06:25.218 --> 06:28.012
{\an1}by dirty old men
who call themselves producers.

06:28.096 --> 06:28.930
Picture it, Brandon.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.475
{\an1}Girls with legs
all the way to their neck.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.393
Not an ounce
out of place.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.145
They're perfect.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.356
{\an3}KELLY:
Perfect, huh?

06:38.439 --> 06:39.524
There's no such thing
as perfect.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.363
{\an1}(sighs)
Listen, Bren,

06:45.446 --> 06:47.532
{\an1}I know it's last minute,
but I was wondering

06:47.615 --> 06:49.992
if we could do this party thing
at your house.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.161
Donna, just leave me
out of this, please.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.454
I'm not exactly prepared

06:53.538 --> 06:54.539
{\an3}to give Kelly a surprise
party right now, okay?

06:54.622 --> 06:56.582
{\an5}But you are coming,
right?
Yeah.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.127
{\an3}I'll definitely be there.
Just tell me where.

06:59.210 --> 06:59.502
(sighs)
Where else?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.712
The Peach Pit.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.217
(indistinct chatter)

07:10.596 --> 07:12.890
{\an3}Hi.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.225
Chip?

07:14.308 --> 07:16.519
{\an3}No, thanks.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.021
{\an3}Dylan, have
you noticed

07:19.105 --> 07:21.190
anyone acting weird
around here lately?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.525
{\an1}Like who?

07:22.608 --> 07:24.152
{\an3}Like David.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.695
David <i> is</i> weird.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.697
{\an3}And Donna.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.699
And Brandon and
Steve and you.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.160
I'm not acting weird.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.661
I'm just reading a book.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.163
I don't know.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.207
{\an6}I just feel
like something
weird's going on.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.544
{\an1}Are you still
taking those things?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.087
Yeah. So?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.214
{\an1}So, maybe you ought
to eat something.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.049
{\an3}I think you're
missing the point.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.556
Vitamins, fiber...

07:53.639 --> 07:57.268
What's phenylpropanolamine?

07:57.351 --> 07:58.853
I don't know.

07:58.936 --> 08:02.190
{\an3}I guess it's the stuff
that makes you lose weight.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.108
{\an1}How many of these
are you taking?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.943
{\an3}Just like it
says on the box.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.361
One before each meal.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.738
{\an3}I did read
the directions.

08:08.821 --> 08:09.739
You sure they're good for you?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.741
{\an3}Dylan,

08:11.824 --> 08:13.576
{\an3}they're over-the-counter
appetite suppressants.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.578
{\an3}You can buy them
anywhere.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.039
{\an3}You are the last person
I would expect

08:18.122 --> 08:18.998
{\an3}to be turning
into my mother.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.708
{\an1}I just don't like to see you
starving yourself.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.755
{\an3}Mmm, happy?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.716
Kel...

08:28.799 --> 08:31.469
Just get off my back.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.095
Look, I'm not on your back.

08:33.179 --> 08:33.763
Then let's just drop it.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.806
What about tonight?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.642
What about tonight?

08:37.725 --> 08:40.102
I'll pick you up about 8:30.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.230
Okay.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.533
Brandon, this is
your last chance.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.700
{\an1}I'm calling the producer
this afternoon.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.577
{\an1}Do I tell him one
or do I tell him...

08:56.661 --> 08:57.620
Look, Steve...
Tell him two.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.497
What?

08:59.580 --> 09:00.623
{\an3}I think you
should do it.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.917
{\an3}You do?
Andrea,

09:03.000 --> 09:03.960
{\an1}you are the last person
in the world

09:04.043 --> 09:07.296
{\an1}I'd expect to tell me
to go do a sexist game show.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.923
Excuse me, what
makes it sexist?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.299
The girl gets to pick

09:10.383 --> 09:11.842
{\an3}which guy she wants
to go out with.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.261
Sounds like fun.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.346
{\an3}Besides, it might help
to fill page three.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.264
{\an1}STEVE: Well,
there you have it,

09:16.347 --> 09:18.140
the Andrea Zuckerman seal
of approval.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.475
What more could you ask for?

09:19.558 --> 09:20.851
Well, what about Kelly's party,
huh?

09:20.935 --> 09:21.811
Did you forget about that?
It's tonight.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.689
No, I have not forgotten
about Kelly's party,

09:24.772 --> 09:26.482
but it doesn't start until 9:00.

09:26.565 --> 09:27.692
The taping will be through
by 7:00, easy.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.694
{\an3}Brandon,
go for it.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.572
Don't you have a class to go to
or something?

09:33.656 --> 09:34.865
{\an3}(laughing)

09:34.949 --> 09:36.367
{\an3}Good-bye,
Brandon.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.827
{\an3}I hope you can handle this
crisis of conscience.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.662
(laughing)

09:39.745 --> 09:41.330
Why are you holding out on me?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.581
I don't get it.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.583
Steve, I just don't think
it's a good idea

09:44.667 --> 09:46.502
for us to do this together,
okay?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.671
I get it.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.714
You're afraid
I'm gonna show you up.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.674
You're afraid one
of those babealicious

09:51.757 --> 09:53.718
women are gonna choose me

09:53.801 --> 09:56.470
{\an3}over you.
You see,

09:56.554 --> 09:58.180
Steve, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.015
{\an3}You get a charge
out of this.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.142
{\an3}You can't stop
competing with me.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.351
{\an1}Brandon,
it's a game show.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.519
{\an1}You're supposed
to compete.

10:03.602 --> 10:04.103
Except you take
things like this

10:04.186 --> 10:04.854
way too seriously, man.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.981
I do not.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.482
All right, what
about the twins

10:08.566 --> 10:09.608
{\an3}on the beach this
summer, huh?

10:09.692 --> 10:11.736
{\an5}I'm a legend
because of that.
Yeah, you are, okay

10:11.819 --> 10:13.362
{\an3}but what about Brooke?
What about Nikki?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.406
{\an3}I'm not gonna get into some
sort of jealousy trip

10:15.489 --> 10:15.906
with you over a
television show.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.200
It's not worth it.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.369
Okay, I see your point, but...

10:20.453 --> 10:21.662
that probably won't happen.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.705
{\an1}It won't even come up,
Brandon.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.831
We probably won't even
be on the same panel.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.000
{\an3}And how do you
know that?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.252
{\an1}Because there's gonna
be dozens of guys there...

10:28.336 --> 10:30.004
and more importantly,

10:30.087 --> 10:33.549
{\an1}there's gonna be dozens
of girls.

10:33.632 --> 10:34.759
{\an1}You'll have a
terrific time, Brandon.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.886
I personally
guarantee it.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.098
{\an3}You promise I won't
regret this?

10:41.182 --> 10:42.558
Regret it?

10:42.641 --> 10:46.228
{\an1}My man, you're gonna fall
in love at first sight.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.399
Okay, okay.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.650
I'll do it.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.235
{\an1}Dude, we're gonna have
such a killer time.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.488
{\an1}I'll pick you up
at a quarter to 5:00.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.827
(sighs)

11:07.833 --> 11:09.752
{\an3}What's the matter,
Kelly?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.754
You tell me.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.173
Tell you what?

11:14.256 --> 11:15.383
You see that?

11:15.466 --> 11:15.758
David, Donna
and Andrea.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.802
So?

11:17.885 --> 11:20.805
{\an1}So they're talking
about me again.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.972
Kelly, it's just
your imagination.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.015
{\an1}Come on,

11:23.099 --> 11:24.934
Steve, just tell me
what's going on.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.437
If I tell you,

11:28.521 --> 11:30.147
{\an1}you've got to promise
no one will know

11:30.231 --> 11:31.941
that it was me
that told you.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.401
Okay, I promise.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.611
Just tell me.

11:35.694 --> 11:36.070
It's about your birthday.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.988
{\an1}Oh, God.
Come on.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.282
{\an1}Donna's planning
a surprise party for you.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.785
{\an1}Practically the entire class
is going to be there.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.787
{\an5}I told Donna I didn't
want a party. I told
Dylan and my mother

11:44.870 --> 11:47.289
that I di...
Calm down, calm down.

11:47.373 --> 11:47.998
{\an1}You do this
to yourself all the time.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.418
{\an1}Remember
when you were 16?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.795
{\an5}You made a big deal
about telling your
mom how you didn't

11:52.878 --> 11:55.339
{\an1}want a sweet 16 party,
so she didn't make you one.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.300
{\an1}Then you got furious
at her.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.844
{\an3}I know, but
that's different.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.972
{\an3}This is a surprise party,
and I hate surprise parties.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.599
What's going on here?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.310
{\an1}This is not the Kelly Taylor
I know and love.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.104
{\an3}Well, maybe I
just don't feel

12:10.187 --> 12:12.148
like being Kelly
Taylor right now.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.817
(sighs)

12:14.900 --> 12:15.568
I'm gonna go home.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.362
Want me to walk
you to your car?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.823
{\an1}No, that's all right,
I'm fine.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.160
{\an1}I-I just--
I want to go.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.870
{\an1}You're going
to be there, right?

12:25.953 --> 12:27.663
{\an3}I wouldn't miss
that for the world.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.956
Good, 'cause you're,
like, the only person

12:29.039 --> 12:32.543
{\an1}in this whole place
I can trust right now.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.506
{\an1}Great news.
We're on.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.341
Peach Pit, 9:00.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.343
{\an5}Great.
It's going
to be perfect.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.094
{\an1}I can't wait
to see Kelly's face

12:42.178 --> 12:44.722
{\an1}when she walks
through that door.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.474
{\an1}STEVE:
Yeah, me, too.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.381
♪ ♪

13:35.648 --> 13:38.817
{\an1}The house has five bedrooms,
four and a half baths.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.779
{\an1}The kitchen, of course,
has been completely renovated.

13:41.862 --> 13:42.863
Hi, Kelly.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.907
{\an1}This is
Jackie's daughter.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.409
{\an3}She goes to West
Beverly Hills High.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.537
{\an1}I was just telling
Mr. Browers here what a great,

13:49.620 --> 13:51.413
uh, school that is.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.414
I wouldn't know.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.208
I just dropped out.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.960
(scoffs)

13:58.003 --> 14:00.756
Do you mind not smoking
in my house?

14:03.801 --> 14:07.054
{\an1}This would be
your room, honey.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.055
What do you think?

14:08.138 --> 14:10.057
It's perfect.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.892
{\an1}Would it be all right
if I opened

14:11.976 --> 14:13.352
{\an6}the closet?
JACKIE:
Oh, of course.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.604
Go right ahead.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.897
(gasping):
Oops.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.608
{\an3}Oh, your daughter has
such beautiful clothes.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.235
Expensive clothes.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.570
{\an1}Oh,

14:22.653 --> 14:25.531
{\an3}Becky, maybe we should get
you something like this.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.408
{\an6}KELLY:
Or maybe she'd
like to try it on

14:27.491 --> 14:30.119
{\an6}while she's here,
although I don't think
red is your best color.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.495
{\an6}JACKIE:
Kelly, what are
you doing home?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.288
Gee, I thought I
still lived here.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.790
{\an3}This is our house,
isn't it, Mom?

14:34.873 --> 14:36.542
{\an1}Yes, but maybe
not much longer.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.501
{\an1}Well,

14:37.585 --> 14:38.794
it is a beautiful house.

14:38.877 --> 14:39.962
Thank you.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.130
{\an3}And we're selling
it real cheap,

14:41.213 --> 14:42.965
{\an3}so why don't you
just take it?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.425
Take everything
while you're here.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.009
Need some new jeans, new shoes,

14:45.092 --> 14:47.011
new underwear?

14:47.094 --> 14:48.137
Why don't you just help yourself
to my closet?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.097
{\an4}Kelly.
What?
You like

14:50.180 --> 14:51.432
this sweater?
Take it, it's yours.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.641
{\an3}JACKIE:
Okay, that's enough.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.642
How about some

14:53.726 --> 14:54.810
new CDs?
A new life?

14:54.893 --> 14:55.811
Why don't you take my boyfriend?

14:55.894 --> 14:58.355
{\an3}We're not getting
along that well anyway.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.649
{\an5}I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to...
Honey, come on.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.984
{\an1}Kelly, I want you
to apologize

15:02.067 --> 15:03.485
{\an1}to Mrs. Brower
and her daughter right now.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.987
{\an3}Did I say
something wrong?

15:05.070 --> 15:05.988
{\an1}(sighs)

15:06.071 --> 15:07.948
{\an1}Thank you
very much.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.033
You're welcome.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.666
Oh, damn it.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.264
{\an5}STEVE:
I wonder
where all the girls are.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.141
{\an1}I don't know,
Steve,

15:34.224 --> 15:36.143
{\an1}probably locked in a
soundproof booth somewhere.

15:36.226 --> 15:39.688
{\an1}Okay, everybody, listen up.
Hi, my name is Bobby

15:39.772 --> 15:41.732
Pandolfo.
I'm the contestant coordinator

15:41.815 --> 15:43.692
{\an1}here at
<i>Love At First Sight.</i>

15:43.776 --> 15:45.527
{\an1}I recognize a lot
of you.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.322
Glad to see you shaved
and got a haircut. (laughs)

15:48.405 --> 15:49.573
{\an1}Okay.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.659
{\an1}Now, we're going
to be taping six shows

15:51.742 --> 15:53.535
here today,
so everybody'll get a chance.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.204
I'm here to teach you how
to play our game.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.205
{\an3}STEVE:
Excuse me, Bobby,

15:56.288 --> 15:59.249
where are all the girls?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.376
{\an1}Down, boy!

16:00.459 --> 16:01.502
{\an1}(laughing):
Okay, no,

16:01.585 --> 16:03.962
they're all back in makeup
getting even more gorgeous

16:04.046 --> 16:05.422
than they already were
when they got here.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.716
{\an1}Okay? Now, for this practice
round, gentlemen,

16:07.800 --> 16:09.551
I'll play the part
of your dream date.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.554
And, uh, everybody ready?

16:12.638 --> 16:13.847
ALL:
Yeah.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.099
{\an1}Gentlemen,
is that the enthusiasm

16:15.182 --> 16:17.935
you're going to show
these beautiful babes, huh?

16:18.018 --> 16:21.605
I said... is everybody ready
to play <i> Love At First Sight?</i>

16:21.689 --> 16:22.272
ALL:
Yeah!

16:22.356 --> 16:23.232
{\an1}(chuckling):
Okay, all right.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.069
Uh... Steve, how about we start
with you?

16:27.152 --> 16:30.239
Let's start out
with something simple.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.409
How far do you like
to go on the first date?

16:36.495 --> 16:37.746
{\an3}(laughs)

16:37.830 --> 16:38.872
Well, that depends.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.084
{\an3}I mean, uh, can you say
that sort of thing on TV?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.210
No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.421
Now, if a girl asks you
how far you

16:45.504 --> 16:48.757
{\an5}like to go on the
first date, a good
answer might be,

16:48.841 --> 16:50.300
uh... (laughs)

16:50.384 --> 16:51.301
Santa Barbara.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.302
Get it?

16:52.386 --> 16:54.304
{\an6}Okay.
(quietly):
This is really bad.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.764
{\an1}All right,
next question.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.308
Uh, Steve, where is
the most unusual place

16:58.392 --> 17:02.604
{\an1}you've ever kissed
a girl?

17:02.688 --> 17:03.397
The belly button!

17:03.480 --> 17:06.191
(laughing):
The belly button.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.276
You've played this before.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.152
{\an5}Did you
hear that?
Steve, this is too lame.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.154
Come on, I'm great at this.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.448
I got to go
to the head.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.991
Hurry up.

17:14.074 --> 17:14.782
One more, one more.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.952
Steve, if you were
a vegetable...

17:17.035 --> 17:19.079
Zucchini.

17:21.039 --> 17:23.584
(coughs)

17:23.666 --> 17:24.460
{\an1}Excuse me.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.463
{\an3}Do you know where
the ladies' room is?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.464
No, not really.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.465
I-I'm sorry.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.383
{\an3}I, I thought
you worked here.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.134
No.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.261
Are you a contestant?

17:34.344 --> 17:36.180
Sort of.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.640
{\an1}I kind of got roped
into this.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.933
Me, too.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.226
So you're a contestant, too?

17:41.310 --> 17:43.145
{\an3}Yeah.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.480
{\an3}I guess we probably
aren't supposed

17:44.563 --> 17:45.647
to be talking
to each other.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.316
{\an3}I could wind up your
dream date or something.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.318
I wouldn't complain.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.070
Me, either.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.990
By the way, I'm
Celeste Lundy.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.283
Hi, Celeste,
I'm Brandon.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.868
Brandon Walsh.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.661
{\an1}Brandon,
they're looking for us.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.287
They want to split us up
into groups.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.330
{\an1}Okay.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.166
{\an1}Uh, I guess
I'll see you later.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.167
Whoa, who's this?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.335
{\an1}Oh, sorry.
Steve, Celeste.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.336
Celeste, Steve.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.545
{\an4}Hi.
STEVE:
Hello.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.297
{\an3}Well, good
luck, Brandon.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.841
You, too, Steve.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.259
BOTH:
Thanks.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.140
{\an5}That's what I
call a dream date.
Oh, yeah.

18:20.224 --> 18:24.645
{\an3}In fact, I think I'm falling
in...<i> Love At First Sight!</i>

18:24.728 --> 18:25.854
Oh!

18:25.938 --> 18:26.355
{\an1}Oh, you're gonna have
a great time, you jerk!

18:26.438 --> 18:28.232
{\an1}Come on!

18:32.236 --> 18:34.738
(grinder whirring)

18:34.822 --> 18:36.740
{\an3}Did they make
an offer?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.200
{\an1}No, they didn't,
and I seriously doubt

18:38.283 --> 18:40.369
we'll be seeing them
in the near future.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.329
I'm sorry.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.540
Yeah, you should be.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.834
{\an1}Whatever possessed you to be
so awful to those people?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.544
I don't know.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.878
I mean, I, I walked in

18:49.962 --> 18:52.381
and I saw total strangers going
through my closet.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.675
Kelly, what am I supposed to do?
Tell every prospective buyer

18:54.758 --> 18:56.718
{\an1}that your room is off limits?
How about we start

18:56.802 --> 18:59.888
{\an1}by telling your broker
not to smoke in the house?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.266
{\an1}How about we start by changing
your attitude right now?

19:02.349 --> 19:05.519
{\an1}Or maybe we should just take
the house off the market

19:05.602 --> 19:06.520
and declare bankruptcy.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.229
How about
if I never say anything

19:07.312 --> 19:09.731
about anything ever again?

19:09.815 --> 19:13.026
That is exactly
what I am talking about.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.445
Practically every conversation
we have had for the last month

19:15.529 --> 19:19.616
has ended in some kind of snide
remark, and I'm sick of it.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.451
So am I.

19:21.535 --> 19:26.415
(sobbing): My life is a total
mess and nobody understands.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.749
{\an1}Honey,

19:27.833 --> 19:30.878
I know you're going
through a rough patch

19:30.961 --> 19:31.420
with the divorce and the move.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.755
We all are.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.967
{\an1}I hate to see you
so moody all the time.

19:37.050 --> 19:37.926
You're not a kid anymore.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.596
You're going
to be 18 years old tomorrow.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.932
{\an1}You got to try and cope
with some of these things.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.059
Don't remind me.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.728
Is that what's bothering you?

19:47.811 --> 19:51.106
I don't know.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.524
Maybe.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.735
This, too, shall pass.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.447
(doorbell rings, Jackie sighs)

19:58.530 --> 20:00.908
I hate open houses.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.763
(talking indistinctly)

20:24.723 --> 20:27.476
{\an3}Okay, listen
up, everybody.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.810
{\an3}If I call
your name out,

20:28.894 --> 20:30.145
that means you are
a contestant

20:30.228 --> 20:31.813
on the first show
we'll be taping here today.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.107
Okay, girls for show
number one will be...

20:34.191 --> 20:35.943
Adrienne Mitchell.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.819
{\an3}Why don't you come
right down here?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.488
And Cynthia Pratt.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.489
{\an3}Don't you
look lovely?

20:40.572 --> 20:44.284
{\an3}And Celeste Lundy,
come on down.

20:46.244 --> 20:49.623
{\an3}Dude, this is definitely
the panel I want to be on.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.624
{\an3}Okay,

20:50.707 --> 20:52.668
{\an1}male contestants
for show number one.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.961
Our friend Steve Sanders,

20:54.044 --> 20:57.005
uh, Mark Garfield--

20:57.089 --> 21:00.467
hi-- and last but not least,
Brandon Walsh.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.345
(Steve and Brandon chuckling)

21:03.428 --> 21:04.554
{\an3}Well, what
do you know?

21:04.638 --> 21:06.515
{\an3}We're on the
same show.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.433
Hmm.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.356
{\an1}Mom, do we have
any wrapping paper?

21:14.439 --> 21:17.192
{\an3}Yeah, sure, hon, it's right
on the window seat over there.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.485
What have you got there?

21:18.568 --> 21:20.862
A, uh, birthday present
for Kelly.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.698
Oh, what did
you get her?

21:22.781 --> 21:23.699
A sweater.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.741
She'll probably return it.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.537
{\an1}Well, you don't sound
very enthusiastic about it.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.330
{\an3}You know,
they asked me

21:30.414 --> 21:32.416
{\an3}if they could have
the party here.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.293
{\an1}Well, it would have been
okay with me.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.213
{\an3}Yeah, but it wouldn't
have been okay with me.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.006
But you are going.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.216
{\an1}I mean, you're still
friends, right?

21:41.299 --> 21:43.218
Yeah.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.387
Well, Brenda,
you're trying.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.888
I know you are.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.557
Well, a party is
a party, right?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.392
Right.

21:50.475 --> 21:54.312
{\an3}You know who I was
thinking about today?

21:54.396 --> 21:56.398
Totally out of the blue?

21:56.481 --> 21:57.691
Darla.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.567
Darla Hansen.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.569
{\an3}What's she up to?
I don't know.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.363
Probably getting ready to go
to the University of Minnesota

22:03.447 --> 22:04.531
just like everybody else
back home.

22:04.614 --> 22:05.949
Do you ever talk to her?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.452
{\an3}Not since her sister
got married.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.203
I mean, we were so close.

22:10.287 --> 22:10.746
I just kind of let her go.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.416
Well, distance is hard.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.959
{\an3}No, it's more
than that.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.627
I mean, when we moved here,

22:17.711 --> 22:20.422
Beverly Hills made everything
back home seem so small,

22:20.505 --> 22:22.340
so insignificant.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.301
But I'm starting to realize
that I miss those guys,

22:24.384 --> 22:25.635
you know, all my old friends.

22:25.719 --> 22:29.556
Well, you've made a lot of good
friends, here, too, sweetie.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.853
Yeah, but still,
I think I'll give Darla a call,

22:34.936 --> 22:36.646
see what's going on
in the real world.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.774
(chuckles)
Good.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.613
(sighs)

22:44.696 --> 22:46.073
So, is she ready?

22:46.156 --> 22:48.283
{\an3}She's been getting dressed
for the past hour.

22:48.366 --> 22:49.910
DYLAN:
Yeah.

22:49.993 --> 22:52.579
Honey? Dylan's here.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.956
{\an1}KELLY:
Oh, my God.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.625
Honey, what's the matter?

22:56.708 --> 22:59.878
I can't find my other red shoe.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.671
This is just perfect.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.632
So, wear another pair.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.841
{\an3}It doesn't matter.
Does it?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.093
{\an4}KELLY:
It's like nothing I do
is right...

23:06.176 --> 23:08.428
I can't even find anything
in my own house.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.763
{\an1}Kelly...

23:10.722 --> 23:13.141
I'm not going.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.810
{\an3}Because of a pair
of shoes?

23:14.893 --> 23:15.977
No.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.938
Because I'm not going, okay?

23:18.021 --> 23:18.980
Thanks for coming.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.148
Now, bye-bye.
Honey...

23:20.232 --> 23:21.358
See you later.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.401
(sighs)

23:23.485 --> 23:25.153
DAVID:
<i>Where'd you get this thing?</i>

23:25.237 --> 23:26.488
<i>It's for, like,</i>
<i>a five year old.</i>

23:26.571 --> 23:28.198
{\an1}It's cute.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.491
{\an1}Besides, Kelly still sleeps
with her teddy bear.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.369
Yeah, well, Renfro's getting
a little ragged.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.162
(door bell jingles)

23:34.246 --> 23:35.539
How's that?

23:35.622 --> 23:37.541
A little higher on your side,

23:37.624 --> 23:38.959
{\an1}Donna.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.502
Bren, you're early.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.671
I thought you guys might need
some help.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.469
Okay, Adrienne.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.304
This is your last question.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.682
Brandon...
if you were an animal,

23:53.765 --> 23:57.686
would you be a tiger,
a puppy or a shark?

23:57.769 --> 24:00.188
(audience giggling)

24:00.272 --> 24:01.690
{\an3}Uh...

24:01.773 --> 24:04.693
I don't know, uh, uh,

24:04.776 --> 24:08.405
I guess I'd be a, a puppy.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.490
Oh, Brandon, you dirty dog.

24:10.574 --> 24:10.824
{\an1}HOST:
Okay, Celeste.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.659
{\an1}You're up.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.327
{\an1}CELESTE:
This is for...

24:14.411 --> 24:15.954
Steve.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.706
If you could take
just three things

24:17.789 --> 24:20.876
to a desert island,
what would they be?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.211
Sunscreen,

24:23.295 --> 24:26.548
a cellular phone, you.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.757
(audience laughs)

24:27.841 --> 24:28.717
{\an1}HOST:
Ooh, sounds serious.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.679
{\an1}Next question,
Celeste.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.681
{\an1}This is
for Brandon.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.850
{\an1}Pretend
you're a famous

24:36.933 --> 24:38.518
plastic surgeon,

24:38.602 --> 24:41.229
and you can transplant parts
of any of the three of us

24:41.313 --> 24:42.856
from one to the other.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.774
Make the perfect woman.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.650
That, that's,
that's a tough one,

24:45.734 --> 24:48.028
you're all very beautiful girls.

24:48.111 --> 24:49.613
I think if I had to
rearrange anything,

24:49.696 --> 24:55.076
I'd, uh... I'd make you all
look like Celeste.

24:55.160 --> 24:55.744
(audience laughs and applauds)

24:55.827 --> 24:57.787
{\an3}Well, I guess
we know

24:57.871 --> 24:59.706
{\an1}who Brandon has
his eye on.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.417
And we'll be back
for more <i> Love at First Sight</i>

25:02.500 --> 25:02.834
right after this.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.212
Don't go away.

25:05.295 --> 25:05.754
(applause and whistling)

25:05.837 --> 25:07.881
What are you doing?

25:07.964 --> 25:09.174
What do you mean,
what am I doing.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.551
{\an5}I'm playing
the game.
No, you're not
playing the game.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.135
You're horning in on Celeste.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.762
{\an3}So, that's
the game.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.096
Steve, I can't help it

25:15.180 --> 25:16.640
if we're both hot
for the same girl.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.266
{\an3}I knew this would happen.
No, you didn't

25:18.350 --> 25:19.434
know this was
gonna happen.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.393
{\an3}I knew this was
gonna happen.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.937
{\an6}I told him;
you wouldn't
listen to me.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.104
That's because
you're a puppy.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.273
(audience applauds)

25:25.357 --> 25:26.858
HOST:
Hi, and we're back

25:26.942 --> 25:28.151
for our final,
lightning round

25:28.235 --> 25:29.361
{\an3}which will determine
which lucky couple

25:29.444 --> 25:32.948
{\an1}gets to go on our <i> Love</i>
<i>at First Sight</i> dream date.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.325
(applause)

25:36.034 --> 25:37.953
(door closes)

25:38.036 --> 25:39.788
She's getting dressed.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.790
{\an3}(sighing):
Thanks.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.960
{\an3}It must require a
mother's touch, huh?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.169
{\an3}What'd you
tell her?

25:46.253 --> 25:48.171
I calmed her down...

25:48.255 --> 25:50.632
and then I did what mothers
always do.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.717
I found her shoe in the hamper.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.804
Maybe I'm getting good at this

25:55.887 --> 25:57.764
{\an1}in my old age.
Mm-hmm.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.780
(knock at door)

26:13.863 --> 26:15.782
Knock, knock.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.075
Come in.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.870
How do I look?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.664
{\an3}Phew, you
look perfect.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.332
Love the shoes.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.418
{\an3}Let's go.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.976
♪ Baby, gonna pick you up
tonight... ♪

26:44.936 --> 26:46.688
Hey, how you doing?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.189
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.191
{\an3}Hey, Nat.
Hello, my darling.

26:50.275 --> 26:50.984
Hello, man.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.653
Uh, you guys,
it's almost 9:30.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.155
{\an1}Shouldn't they be here
by now?

26:55.238 --> 26:55.905
Donna just went
to call Jackie.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.824
Kelly sure has a
lot of friends.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.826
{\an3}The natives are
getting restless.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.995
{\an3}Where's the guest
of honor?

27:03.330 --> 27:05.373
{\an1}I talked to Jackie;
they just left the house.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.917
{\an3}Okay, yo, listen
up, everybody!

27:08.001 --> 27:09.377
{\an3}Hey!

27:09.461 --> 27:11.379
Kelly should be here
in about ten minutes.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.465
(cheering and applause)

27:15.467 --> 27:16.593
{\an1}HOST:
All right.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.887
{\an1}Steve and Brandon have
both picked Celeste.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.430
{\an1}Mark has chosen
Cynthia.

27:20.513 --> 27:22.432
{\an1}And now it's
the girls' turn.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.059
So, let's see
if we have a match.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.226
Cynthia, who have you chosen

27:25.310 --> 27:28.063
{\an3}for your
dream date?

27:28.146 --> 27:29.606
Cynthia picked Steve.

27:29.689 --> 27:30.899
{\an1}All right,
there's no match there.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.525
Now Adrienne, you
weren't selected

27:32.609 --> 27:34.402
{\an3}which means you'll
already be returning

27:34.486 --> 27:35.070
{\an1}in our next group
of contestants,

27:35.153 --> 27:37.072
{\an1}but let's see
who you picked,

27:37.155 --> 27:38.573
just for fun.

27:38.656 --> 27:39.741
Brandon.

27:39.824 --> 27:40.950
{\an1}And finally,
Celeste.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.703
{\an1}A very popular lady
right now.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.872
Celeste, have you fallen
in love at first sight?

27:45.955 --> 27:47.540
Yes.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.751
{\an1}So, who is it,
Brandon or Steve?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.878
Steve.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.421
{\an1}All right,
we have a match!

27:53.505 --> 27:54.464
Celeste and Steve!

27:54.547 --> 27:55.799
Are we in <i> Love</i>
<i>at First Sight?</i>

27:55.882 --> 27:57.967
(applause and whistling)

27:58.051 --> 28:01.096
{\an1}Well, Steve, are you ready
for your dream date?

28:01.179 --> 28:02.514
Yes, sir.

28:02.597 --> 28:02.931
{\an1}How 'bout you,
Celeste?

28:03.014 --> 28:04.891
I sure am.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.267
Well, you both sound
pretty enthusiastic.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.478
And I know you're going
to have a great night.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.773
And of course, we want
to hear all about it.

28:11.856 --> 28:12.982
So, Celeste,
take notes,

28:13.066 --> 28:14.442
{\an1}because we want to hear
everything.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.110
{\an3}Well, you look
like you're ready

28:15.193 --> 28:16.945
{\an3}to plant a big
one right

28:17.028 --> 28:18.196
{\an1}on that gorgeous kisser
of his,

28:18.279 --> 28:19.614
{\an4}right here
and right now.
Mm-hmm.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.699
{\an1}Well, go on.
Go for it.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.536
{\an1}HOST:
Whoo! All right!

28:24.619 --> 28:25.245
(applause and whistling)

28:25.328 --> 28:26.830
{\an1}Right now
we have a limousine

28:26.913 --> 28:29.958
{\an1}waiting outside
our studio,

28:30.041 --> 28:30.792
{\an3}ready to whisk Steve
and Celeste away

28:30.875 --> 28:32.001
on their <i> Love</i>

28:32.085 --> 28:34.462
{\an1}<i>at First Sight</i>
dream date.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.630
Now?

28:35.713 --> 28:36.339
{\an1}Right now,
Steve.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.091
Tell 'em what they've won, Don.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.634
DON:
Steve and Celeste will speed

28:39.717 --> 28:40.969
from our studios in Hollywood

28:41.052 --> 28:43.930
to Santa Monica's fabulous
Beachfront Oasis Resort

28:44.013 --> 28:45.473
and Hotel,

28:45.557 --> 28:48.643
where they will dine as guests
of <i> Love at First Sight...</i>

28:48.726 --> 28:49.519
I can't do this tonight,

28:49.602 --> 28:51.604
I've got a birthday party
to go to.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.939
{\an5}...overlooking the beautiful
Santa Monica bay.
Hey!

28:53.022 --> 28:54.983
The two of you, you make
a great looking couple.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.943
Right down here.
Look, I can't do this tonight.

28:57.026 --> 28:57.986
I have other plans.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.530
{\an1}What do you mean
you have other plans?

29:00.613 --> 29:01.406
I mean I have
other plans.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.032
{\an1}Nobody said anything to me
about tonight.

29:03.116 --> 29:06.202
I can't do this.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.705
Steve, you signed
the release forms.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.123
{\an1}Didn't you,
didn't you read it, huh?

29:10.206 --> 29:13.126
No time to get
cold feet now!

29:13.209 --> 29:14.836
Listen, if you don't want
to go through with this,

29:14.919 --> 29:16.087
that's okay.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.339
No, no it's not okay.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.467
Do you know how much this
"dream date" set us back, huh?

29:20.550 --> 29:21.885
{\an3}You're going, you're
gonna have a great time.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.471
{\an6}And you're gonna
come back and tell
us all about it.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.889
Look, my job is on
the line here, bud.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.892
{\an3}So just shut up and
get in the car.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.153
{\an3}KELLY:
Are you hot?

29:40.236 --> 29:42.155
It is so hot.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.740
No, it's not.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.158
It's freezing, Kel.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.576
{\an1}(sighs)

29:48.620 --> 29:51.873
{\an1}My heart is beating
so fast.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.917
{\an3}What is it?
Something you ate?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.502
Hardly.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.504
{\an3}It's probably those
diet pills, Kel.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.880
I told you.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.882
{\an1}They're over the counter,
harmless nothings.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.550
{\an1}I'm just really
stressed out

30:02.634 --> 30:04.552
about this whole
birthday thing.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.554
{\an3}What whole
birthday thing?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.223
{\an1}Nothing.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.015
Who told you?

30:09.098 --> 30:10.892
{\an1}Nobody.
I figured it out

30:10.975 --> 30:12.936
{\an1}on my own.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.354
All the whispering
behind my back had

30:14.437 --> 30:15.438
to mean something.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.232
That's why you were so stressed
out about what to wear

30:17.315 --> 30:18.066
{\an6}tonight.
Well, I couldn't look
like a slob

30:18.149 --> 30:20.944
{\an3}at my own birthday party.
Kel,

30:21.027 --> 30:22.070
you never look like a slob.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.031
Do you remember

30:25.114 --> 30:26.407
in the second grade,

30:26.491 --> 30:28.701
Mrs. Doveetch make me "King
for a Day" on my birthday.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.079
Yeah, you looked very cute
in your little crown.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.413
{\an3}Yeah,

30:32.497 --> 30:33.915
but it was also Kathy Collen's
birthday.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.583
So she got the wand,
I got the crown,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.252
{\an3}and we had to agree
on what all

30:37.335 --> 30:38.711
of our royal commands
were gonna be.

30:38.795 --> 30:39.254
It was awful.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.965
Brenda told me once

30:42.048 --> 30:43.132
that she asked her parents
to move her birthday

30:43.216 --> 30:46.135
so she wouldn't have to share it
with Brandon anymore.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.096
So, I guess none of us are very
good at sharing.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.892
Do you think
she'll be there tonight?

30:52.976 --> 30:54.185
Yeah, of course she will be.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.524
Hey.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.070
Hey, hey, did I make it?

31:04.153 --> 31:05.613
{\an1}Yeah, but they'll be here
any minute.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.282
{\an1}(car honking horn)
Oh, that's them!

31:07.365 --> 31:08.408
{\an1}That's Dylan's
signal.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.951
{\an1}Everyone hide,
hide!

31:10.034 --> 31:11.244
Move, move, move.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.120
{\an3}Get down!

31:12.203 --> 31:14.122
{\an1}Get down.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.416
Okay, okay, cool.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.296
{\an3}Kelly, you sure you're ready
to go through with this?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.798
{\an1}I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.800
{\an3}All right.

31:25.883 --> 31:28.636
ALL:
Surprise!

31:28.720 --> 31:30.722
(cheering and applause)

31:32.890 --> 31:33.808
Thank you.

31:33.891 --> 31:35.143
What are you guys doing here?

31:35.226 --> 31:36.811
{\an1}It's your 18th
birthday.

31:36.894 --> 31:37.228
{\an1}I couldn't just
let it go.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.063
Happy Birthday.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.983
{\an3}I didn't think you guys
were gonna show up.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.443
Man, what happened?

31:43.526 --> 31:45.528
{\an1}Traffic.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.991
Kelly, Happy Birthday.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.618
Thanks.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.791
So, how's the
birthday girl?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.793
Very surprised.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.837
Where's Steve?

32:02.920 --> 32:04.839
{\an3}He got the girl behind
door number three.

32:04.922 --> 32:06.174
{\an1}(chuckles)

32:06.257 --> 32:08.051

sweetie.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.232
The cake's supposed to be
at midnight.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.235

of your dreams?

34:48.418 --> 34:50.129
I thought so.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.922
And then she found Steve.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.341
Too bad.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.134
But it will make great copy.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.678
{\an5}Jordan, would you
do me a favor?
Hmm?

34:57.762 --> 35:00.139
{\an3}Would you tell your friend
here that not every one

to end up in her newspaper?

35:02.266 --> 35:04.227

Excuse me, Kel.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.531
{\an1}Kelly, are you okay?
Yeah.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.450
Yeah, I'm sorry,
did you need the sink?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.285
Yeah.

I'll be out in just a minute.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.923
{\an1}Okay.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.372
(whimpers)

36:06.455 --> 36:10.418
{\an3}18 candles and
one for good luck.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.253
Uh, David, will you
go get the lights?

36:12.336 --> 36:13.754
{\an1}Oh, we can't do
the cake thing yet.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.256
Kelly's in the bathroom.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.299
Well, it's almost midnight.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.383
We'd better do it before people
start to leave.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.260
I'll go get her.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.553
No, it's all right, I will.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.054
{\an3}You finish the cake.
Okay.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.932
Should we light it?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.434
Uh, yeah, go ahead.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.270
I'll be right there in a minute.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.938
I just have to get Kelly.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.940
Oh, my God, Kelly!

36:33.024 --> 36:34.901
Brandon, Nat, call 911!

36:35.860 --> 36:37.778
Kelly.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.446
{\an1}Oh, my God,
Kelly, come on.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.448
Kelly, wake up.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.824
Kelly, wake up!

36:41.908 --> 36:43.951
{\an1}Hurry up!

36:58.174 --> 37:01.093
{\an1}I've never seen anyone
finish dinner so quickly.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.470
I told you I'd
get you here.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.014
{\an1}Are you sure you won't
come in with me?

37:05.097 --> 37:06.390
No, they're your friends.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.811
Thanks, Celeste.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.979
For everything.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.814
Go on, maybe you
can get in there

37:13.898 --> 37:14.315
{\an3}before Kelly blows
out her candles.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.693
Can I call you?

37:17.777 --> 37:19.987
You'd better.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.461
(engine starts)

37:52.311 --> 37:53.980
Nat, where is everybody?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.356
What happened?

37:56.399 --> 37:57.942
I got some bad news.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.908
You know, I knew she was taking

38:05.992 --> 38:08.536
too many of those
stupid diet pills.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.246
Plus the fact
that she apparently

38:10.329 --> 38:12.164
hasn't eaten anything
in, like, two weeks.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.166
I should've thrown them away.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.376
{\an3}DONNA:
It's not your fault.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.544
None of us did anything.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.587
{\an3}BRANDON:
Do you guys think maybe

38:18.671 --> 38:21.007
she has anorexia or, uh...

38:21.090 --> 38:22.008
Bulimia?

38:22.091 --> 38:24.010
{\an1}Yeah.
Has anybody seen

38:24.093 --> 38:26.053
her binge, throw up,
anything like that?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.222
I haven't,
what about you, Donna?

38:28.306 --> 38:29.890
No, me either.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.017
Bren?

38:31.642 --> 38:34.854
We haven't been spending
too much time together lately.

38:38.774 --> 38:40.234
(door opens)

38:43.279 --> 38:44.655
What'd the doctor say?

38:44.739 --> 38:46.991
Well, she's gonna be fine.

38:47.074 --> 38:49.118
Jackie's in there with
the doctor right now.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.120
{\an3}He said we could
see her pretty soon.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.581
{\an1}Well, I-I think I'm
gonna go to the coffee shop.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.082
Does anyone want to come?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.375
We will.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.418
{\an1}DAVID:
Yeah, me, too.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.045
{\an3}It's better than
waiting around here.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.550
D, you coming down?

39:04.633 --> 39:07.094
No, man, I think I, uh,
I'm just gonna stay right here.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.137
You guys go ahead, though.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.222
I think I'll stay, too, Brandon.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.308
Cool.

39:13.642 --> 39:14.727
{\an3}You know, most
of the time

39:14.810 --> 39:18.606
Kelly and I don't even know
if we're friends anymore.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.610
Maybe I should just go home.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.278
No, Bren, stay.

39:24.361 --> 39:26.364
{\an1}I know she'll
want to see you.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.329
{\an1}I still don't understand
how this happened.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.289
I thought these things
are supposed to be safe.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.457
You can buy them
in the supermarket.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.584
They generally are,

39:38.667 --> 39:39.835
if they're used properly.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.796
But Kelly's been taking
as much as twice,

39:41.879 --> 39:42.755
possibly three times

39:42.838 --> 39:46.467
{\an1}the normal dosage
for a couple of weeks now.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.968
Combined with too much
caffeine and no food,

39:48.052 --> 39:49.428
{\an1}her heart
couldn't handle it.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.430
But I feel fine now.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.681
You got off easy.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.600
I've seen much worse problems:

39:54.683 --> 39:57.311
kidney damage, even strokes.

39:57.394 --> 39:59.730
Honey, what could possibly

39:59.814 --> 40:02.149
{\an1}have possessed you
to do this to yourself?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.651
{\an3}I didn't do
anything to myself.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.152
{\an3}I went on a diet,
that's all.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.155
A starvation diet that
could have killed you.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.824
But I'm fine now.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.158
Right, Doctor?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.535
Well, I don't see any
need for you to stay

40:12.618 --> 40:13.494
in the hospital after tonight,

40:13.577 --> 40:18.499
but I want you eating,
young lady.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.168
{\an1}A balanced,
sensible diet.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.297
And I want you to consider
getting into some kind

40:25.381 --> 40:27.842
of professional support system.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.718
How 'bout if I just promise
to pig out a couple of times?

40:29.802 --> 40:33.180
This is no joke, Kelly.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.892
You're not in real trouble yet,
but you're on your way.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.895
Now, the hospital

40:39.979 --> 40:40.604
has a very good
eating disorder group.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.524
I don't have an eating disorder.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.194
{\an1}Honey, I think you
should consider what

40:47.278 --> 40:48.362
{\an1}Dr. Tarica
is suggesting.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.406
What, spend an hour in a circle

40:50.489 --> 40:52.825
with a bunch of girls groaning
about food? No, thank you.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.577
{\an6}JACKIE:
It's okay, we'll
talk about it later.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.714
Guys, she can
see you now,

41:06.797 --> 41:09.216
{\an3}but it's late, so
just for a minute, okay?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.634
Go ahead in.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.388
{\an6}DYLAN:
Kelly.
BRENDA:
Hi, Kel.

41:14.471 --> 41:15.598
{\an6}DONNA:
Leave it to you,
Kel, to know how

41:15.681 --> 41:17.558
to get attention
on your birthday.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.268
I told you I didn't
want a party.

41:22.354 --> 41:24.273
Steve.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.399
Hey, is Kelly all right?

41:25.482 --> 41:26.442
{\an3}She's okay, Steve,
she's okay.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.818
Wh-Where is she?
She's, uh, in 105.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.201
The paramedic was very cute.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.744
Yeah, how was all that
mouth-to-mouth, Kel?

41:36.827 --> 41:39.496
I had mouth-to-mouth?

41:39.580 --> 41:41.707
{\an5}DYLAN:
Don't get excited, I don't think
"very" is the word.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.334
Oh he was "very."

41:43.417 --> 41:44.752
You better get out of here

41:44.835 --> 41:45.711
before the nurses
have me arrested.

41:45.794 --> 41:48.923
Bye, Kel.
See you later, Kel.

41:49.006 --> 41:49.965
Take care, good night, Kel.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.217
Thanks, Donna.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.760
Feel better, okay?

41:52.843 --> 41:54.595
{\an3}You picked a hell of a place
to have a birthday party.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.722
Steve, you came.

41:56.805 --> 41:57.765
I wouldn't miss your birthday.
Oh.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.601
You didn't tell them
I told you, did you?

42:00.684 --> 42:02.811
No, of course not.

42:04.980 --> 42:05.814
{\an1}JACKIE:
I hate to break this up,

42:05.898 --> 42:09.860
but, uh, it is time
to say "good night."

42:09.944 --> 42:10.778
{\an3}Good night, Kel.
Feel better, sweetheart.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.447
Feel better,
you look good.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.407
Bye.
Bye.

42:15.491 --> 42:17.409
{\an1}Bye, guys.
Bye.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.287
Uh, Dylan, could you leave us
alone for a minute?

42:20.371 --> 42:21.413
{\an1}Is that okay?
Sure.

42:21.497 --> 42:24.083
Come on, Dylan, why don't you
buy me a cup of coffee?

42:30.547 --> 42:32.800
You scared me.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.761
Don't worry, I'm fine.

42:35.844 --> 42:38.305
In fact, it looks like
I'm going to live,

42:38.389 --> 42:39.807
so you can't have Dylan back.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.642
Kelly, we all have to stop

42:41.725 --> 42:43.686
making ourselves nuts
about the past.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.856
But, Kelly, please,

42:47.940 --> 42:49.483
if you were trying
to punish yourself...

42:49.567 --> 42:50.484
Brenda, I really

42:50.567 --> 42:52.319
think you're overreacting.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.821
I just took too many diet pills.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.782
Why is everybody acting like
I tried to commit suicide?

42:56.865 --> 42:59.034
I'm not saying that.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.828
All I'm saying is that
no matter what's happened,

43:00.911 --> 43:04.123
I love you.

43:05.624 --> 43:06.750
Even though you don't
always know it,

43:06.834 --> 43:10.462
{\an1}and even though
I don't always show it.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.173
So don't ever let it
happen again, okay?

43:13.257 --> 43:13.841
Okay.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.682
Call me tomorrow, I'll take you
out for ice cream.

43:21.765 --> 43:22.766
{\an3}Ha, ha.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.362
Okay?

43:35.446 --> 43:36.822
Yeah, everything's okay.

43:39.658 --> 43:40.743
Thank you.

43:42.494 --> 43:44.538
Good night, Bren.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.066
You doing all right?

44:12.149 --> 44:14.193
Yeah, I guess I am.

44:15.986 --> 44:19.907
{\an1}It's after midnight,
so happy birthday.

44:19.990 --> 44:20.908
Thanks.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.910
{\an3}Dylan?

44:22.993 --> 44:25.871
Hmm?

44:25.954 --> 44:28.540
Thanks for staying.

44:28.624 --> 44:31.001
Where else would I want to be?

44:38.884 --> 44:41.887
Get some sleep, okay?
