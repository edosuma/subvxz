PASTOR:
Do not lose heart.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.556
Though outwardly we are wasting away...

41:57.724 --> 42:01.935
...inwardly we are being renewed
day by day.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.857
For our light and momentary troubles...

42:07.025 --> 42:13.405
...are achieving for us an eternal glory
that far outweighs them all.

42:14.616 --> 42:18.952
We know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed...

42:19.120 --> 42:21.914
...we have a building from God...

42:22.081 --> 42:27.794
...a house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.

42:28.213 --> 42:32.174
For God has given us the spirit
as a guarantee.

42:32.342 --> 42:35.594
And as long as we are at home
in the body...

42:35.762 --> 42:38.764
...we are away from the Lord.

42:39.224 --> 42:42.768
We walk by faith, not by sight.

42:43.311 --> 42:47.272
And so fix our eyes not on what is seen...

42:47.440 --> 42:50.150
...but what is unseen.

42:50.318 --> 42:53.654
For what is seen is temporary...

42:53.821 --> 42:56.615
...what is unseen...

42:56.783 --> 42:58.450
...eternal.
