00:01.836 --> 00:03.460
<i> - Last year,</i>
<i> a competition was created</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.629
<i> to test the nation's</i>
<i> best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:08.007
<i> Thousands responded,</i>
<i> and this year,</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.925
<i> craftsmen</i>
<i> from all over the country</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:11.802
<i> and all walks of life</i>
<i> have come forward</i>

00:11.846 --> 00:13.971
<i> for their chance</i>
<i> to claim the title.</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:15.556
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.807
- I want to win!

00:16.851 --> 00:18.267
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.977
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.312
<i> Now the Forge returns</i>
<i> with challenges</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.773
<i> unlike anything</i>
<i> ever seen before.</i>

00:24.817 --> 00:26.650
You'll be using this.

00:26.694 --> 00:30.154
<i> Skill and ingenuity</i>
<i> will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:32.156
<i> Some will rise</i>
<i> to the challenge.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:34.616
<i> Some will fall,</i>
<i> but only the best</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:37.286
<i> will be crowned</i>
<i> "Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.580
<i> and take home $10,000.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.624
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:49.298
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

00:49.341 --> 00:50.299
<i> - My name is Nathan Zimmerman.</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:52.259
<i> I'm 25 years old.</i>

00:52.303 --> 00:54.636
I think I'm a bit of an outlier
in the knife-making community.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.346
<i> I tend to be the youngest one</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:57.848
<i>and I take a lot of inspiration</i>

00:57.892 --> 01:00.476
<i> from video games</i>
<i> and fantasy novels.</i>

01:00.519 --> 01:02.311
<i> - My name is Ben Abbott.</i>

01:02.354 --> 01:05.022
I've been making blades since
I was about 13 years old.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.815
I was born
in Worcester, England.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.318
<i> When I saw all the cool</i>
<i> armor and weapons and stuff,</i>

01:09.361 --> 01:11.820
I just decided to start
making it for myself.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.572
<i> - My name's Tom McGinnis.</i>

01:13.616 --> 01:15.657
I'm 73 years old

01:15.701 --> 01:17.868
<i> and I love knife-making.</i>

01:17.912 --> 01:20.871
<i> I made my first knife in 1958.</i>

01:20.915 --> 01:24.833
I'm an old duck,
but I'm gonna hang tough.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.335
<i> - My name is</i>
<i> Brent Stubblefield.</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:28.420
I made my first knife
about eight years ago.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.172
<i> What I get out of</i>
<i> being a bladesmith</i>

01:30.216 --> 01:32.049
<i> is the satisfaction of knowing</i>

01:32.093 --> 01:36.845
I'm making a piece that could be
passed down for generations.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.348
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.934
You are here to engage
in three rounds of competition,

01:41.977 --> 01:44.770
specifically designed
to test every aspect

01:44.814 --> 01:47.397
of your edged weapon-making
capabilities

01:47.441 --> 01:49.858
from design to the forge

01:49.902 --> 01:51.360
to fit and finish.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.362
After each round,
you will present your work

01:53.405 --> 01:55.197
to our panel of expert judges.

01:55.241 --> 01:58.367
Internationally known
Mastersmith J. Neilson.

01:58.410 --> 02:02.579
Next, world-renowned swordsmith
David Baker.

02:02.623 --> 02:07.376
And last, edged weapon
specialist Doug Marcaida.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.254
They will decide which of you
is the "Forged in Fire" champion

02:10.297 --> 02:14.049
and leaves here
with a check for $10,000.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.717
In your first round
of competition,

02:15.761 --> 02:18.929
you'll be using...

02:18.973 --> 02:20.389
this.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.392
It's a welded pile
of various metals.

02:23.435 --> 02:26.854
Your challenge is
to salvage the metal you need

02:26.897 --> 02:28.397
from this pile

02:28.440 --> 02:31.150
to forge a signature blade
of your own design,

02:31.193 --> 02:34.278
turning them into
fully-functional weapons.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.779
<i> - It's just a pile of junk.</i>

02:35.823 --> 02:37.281
Not just a pile of junk.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.074
It's welded together.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.076
<i>I don't know what kind of steel</i>
<i> these things are</i>

02:41.120 --> 02:43.078
<i> and what they were used for.</i>

02:43.122 --> 02:44.997
- Your weapons
will then be tested

02:45.040 --> 02:47.416
<i> chopping through a dowel,</i>

02:47.459 --> 02:49.418
<i> and slicing fish.</i>

02:49.461 --> 02:53.130
The blades themselves must fall
within the following parameters:

02:53.174 --> 02:55.257
<i> the length of the blade,</i>
<i> not including the tang,</i>

02:55.301 --> 02:59.094
<i> must be between</i>
<i> 11 and 13 inches.</i>

02:59.138 --> 03:00.762
<i> The overall length</i>
<i> of your weapon</i>

03:00.806 --> 03:04.099
<i> must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:04.143 --> 03:05.601
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:05.644 --> 03:07.436
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.272
You will have three hours
to salvage your steel

03:10.316 --> 03:12.274
and forge your blades.

03:12.318 --> 03:15.694
Bladesmiths,
your time starts now.

03:15.738 --> 03:18.447
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

03:18.490 --> 03:20.782
- This challenge,
it's really all about the edge.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.659
Your edge geometry
and your edge retention.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.163
- Well, it'd be nice to see some
well defined choppers here.

03:26.207 --> 03:30.083
That truly hacking,
slashing shape.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.627
<i> - I decided to go with</i>

03:31.670 --> 03:34.463
<i> a BladeSports-style</i>
<i> chopper sort of thing.</i>

03:34.506 --> 03:36.298
<i> I know it's gonna be</i>
<i> cutting that's needed</i>

03:36.342 --> 03:38.300
instead of thrusting,
so I don't see the point

03:38.344 --> 03:39.468
of putting a tip on the knife.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.637
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

03:41.680 --> 03:43.513
- Ah-ha.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.016
<i> I'm making a camp blade/seax.</i>

03:46.060 --> 03:49.853
<i> A seax was a fighting weapon</i>
<i> from the Vikings or Saxons.</i>

03:49.897 --> 03:52.314
Pretty much does exactly
what I'm hoping what mine will

03:52.358 --> 03:55.150
which is cut and slash
and tear.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.985
<i> I decide to do</i>
<i> the San Mai construction.</i>

03:57.029 --> 03:58.487
<i> San Mai construction</i>
<i> is essentially</i>

03:58.530 --> 04:00.197
<i> two pieces of softer steel</i>

04:00.241 --> 04:02.908
on either side of a center core
of hardened steel.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.369
I think it'll be
a little something special.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.038
<i> - I'm making</i>
<i> a big competition knife.</i>

04:08.082 --> 04:10.332
<i> It's designed</i>
<i> for heavy chopping,</i>

04:10.376 --> 04:12.668
<i> and it'll also cut</i>
<i> real thin material</i>

04:12.711 --> 04:14.670
like playing cards.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.338
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

04:16.382 --> 04:18.799
The best advice I have
for anyone wanting

04:18.842 --> 04:23.387
to get into knife-making
is don't quit your day job.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.849
- I draw out a bowie and a seax
because I really feel like

04:27.893 --> 04:29.685
<i> they're gonna be great</i>
<i> in the testing,</i>

04:29.728 --> 04:31.812
<i> but I'm just gonna let</i>
<i> the forging process</i>

04:31.855 --> 04:34.773
take me in the direction
that the knife wants to go.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.858
<i> For me, the hardest part</i>
<i> of this challenge</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:39.528
is going to be
to decide what to use

04:39.571 --> 04:41.947
<i> and then turn it</i>
<i> into a nice billet.</i>

04:41.991 --> 04:45.075
- Bladesmiths,
your ten minute design period

04:45.119 --> 04:47.035
is now closed.

04:47.079 --> 04:50.664
Your three hour forge time
starts...now.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.709
<i> [rock music]</i>

04:53.752 --> 04:55.127
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

04:55.170 --> 04:56.712
- There's a lot
of steel there, J.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.381
How much of that is
actually usable in a blade?

04:59.425 --> 05:03.260
- It's probably at least
30, 35% of what's there.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.637
<i> - There's a square pipe,</i>
<i> there's a ball bearing,</i>

05:05.681 --> 05:07.431
<i> powdered metal,</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:11.518
but I'm thrilled there's
a piece of lawn mower blade.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.728
- Look at that.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.396
Tom knocked
a piece of steel out

05:14.440 --> 05:15.731
in about half a second.
- Oh, yeah. Bing, bang, boom.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.900
- I know how to work it.
I know how to harden it.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.403
- I'm very worried about getting
the right amount of steel

05:21.447 --> 05:23.447
to use for my knife.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.324
<i> I know the lawn mower blade's</i>
<i> gonna give me enough steel,</i>

05:25.367 --> 05:27.701
<i> and it pops right off.</i>

05:27.745 --> 05:29.953
- Aside from just
the hardenable steel,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.913
we've got some wrought iron,
we've got some mild,

05:31.957 --> 05:33.248
we've got some horseshoes.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.374
- I pick the lawnmower blade.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.584
[clangs]

05:35.627 --> 05:37.419
Nice.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.796
- Ben's going for
multiple pieces of steel here.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.757
<i> - I also take the angle iron</i>

05:41.800 --> 05:43.800
so that I can weld
the lawnmower blade

05:43.844 --> 05:45.135
<i> inside the angle iron</i>
<i> to make</i>

05:45.179 --> 05:47.304
<i> a San Mai construction.</i>

05:47.348 --> 05:49.765
- I decide to use
the lawnmower blade.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.433
<i> You know,</i>
<i> it's a nice, big slab.</i>

05:51.477 --> 05:52.934
<i> I know I'll plenty.</i>

05:52.978 --> 05:54.978
If anything,
I'll have to cut some off.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.105
- So, every single one
of our smiths

05:57.149 --> 05:59.274
has chose a mower blade.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.276
- I mean, it's good,
harden-able steel.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.527
It's--that's the safe choice.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.529
It is semi-flat already.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.323
But a lot of metal to move.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.283
- It might be a challenge
to draw it out,

06:08.327 --> 06:11.453
and shape a blade out of it.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.955
- Aah, crap.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.123
Oh.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.209
- Tom has a chunk of steel.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.796
Tom's got the entire blade.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.174
- I got started out
like a monkey.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.467
Aw, [bleep].

06:25.511 --> 06:28.428
Hot steel on the floor.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.180
<i> But there's no excuse.</i>

06:30.224 --> 06:33.433
A good knife maker ought
to be able to walk in any shop

06:33.477 --> 06:35.310
and make a blade.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.396
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

06:37.439 --> 06:38.814
- Yeah!

06:38.857 --> 06:40.232
My strategy
going into this challenge

06:40.275 --> 06:43.860
is not spend too much time
on one thing.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.155
<i> The first thing is just</i>
<i> turning this big honking blade</i>

06:47.199 --> 06:48.907
into a knife billet.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.659
- Now, Brent looks like he's
got some pretty good control

06:50.702 --> 06:52.244
on Big Blu there.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.496
<i> - I've never used</i>
<i> a power hammer before,</i>

06:54.540 --> 06:56.123
<i> and it is wonderful.</i>

06:56.166 --> 07:00.085
It enables you to move steel
at a superhuman level.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.586
It is just like hammering,

07:01.630 --> 07:04.339
but you can do it
at the speed of Superman.

07:04.383 --> 07:08.844
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

07:08.887 --> 07:10.470
- We're going now, man.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.347
- Ben's going the extra mile

07:12.391 --> 07:14.266
by adding some angle iron

07:14.309 --> 07:16.685
to create what you call
a San Mai,

07:16.728 --> 07:20.397
which is basically sandwiching
unhardenable outer steel

07:20.441 --> 07:21.690
onto a hard core.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.024
<i>- I do the San Mai construction</i>

07:23.068 --> 07:26.153
because it is
a sexy-looking blade,

07:26.196 --> 07:27.529
makes a very tough blade.

07:27.573 --> 07:28.530
You will never
crack the whole thing.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.031
It'll never break in two.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.199
- Ben's taking that angle iron,

07:31.243 --> 07:33.535
folding it into,
like, a metal taco,

07:33.579 --> 07:37.747
and he's gonna insert the good
steel core inside that way.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.249
All right, here we go.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.293
Just open the taco.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.919
- Oh!

07:42.963 --> 07:44.296
Oh, you don't want
to touch that.

07:44.339 --> 07:49.885
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

07:49.928 --> 07:51.178
- Damn.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.888
Your giant brass balls
are showing.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.222
- [giggles]

07:54.266 --> 07:56.057
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

07:56.101 --> 07:57.392
<i> - My strategy</i>
<i> going into this competition</i>

07:57.436 --> 07:59.561
is forge thick, grind thin.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.063
- Nathan has
a large chunk of steel

08:02.107 --> 08:03.064
to be playing with.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.900
- Big piece of steel.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.568
<i> - I'm doing a basic shaping</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

08:06.612 --> 08:08.737
<i> I'm going</i>
<i> back and forth between</i>

08:08.780 --> 08:11.239
<i> hammers and the press</i>
<i> and the power hammer</i>

08:11.283 --> 08:14.075
<i> and trying to get</i>
<i> this big piece of steel moved</i>

08:14.119 --> 08:16.661
to where I need
to get it moved to.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.914
<i> I figure I can fix</i>
<i> the rest of it on the grinder,</i>

08:18.957 --> 08:20.415
and just rip all the material
off of that

08:20.459 --> 08:23.126
<i> where I'm more comfortable.</i>

08:23.170 --> 08:24.753
- Bladesmiths!

08:24.796 --> 08:28.256
You have only two hours left
to finish your work.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.091
- Whoo!
Brother.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.761
Only two hours.

08:32.804 --> 08:36.598
To forge
the world's greatest blade.

08:36.642 --> 08:39.226
- We've got
a lot of sparks flying.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.644
- Oh!

08:40.687 --> 08:41.770
- I got sparks reaching
all the way over here.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.396
Awesome.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.607
I'm ready.
- [laughs]

08:45.651 --> 08:48.610
- San Mai technique allows me
to quench before everybody else.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.153
<i> After I harden it,</i>

08:50.197 --> 08:52.072

<i> to finish the blade</i>

09:01.333 --> 09:03.375
Put your name on it yet?
[giggles]

09:03.418 --> 09:04.960
- Got the oldest smith
and the younger smith

09:05.003 --> 09:07.379
right next to each other,
chatting it up a little bit,

09:07.422 --> 09:09.214
hurling sparks
across the shop.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.423
That's great.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.971

with a torch.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.390
- Tom's got the cutting torch
out there.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.850
- Yes!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.143
First time we've seen this

- That's great.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.646
I've been waiting
for somebody to do this.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.981
- So have I.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.941
- That's gonna give Tom
a hard edge

09:27.985 --> 09:29.484
and a soft spine.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.653
- I'm gonna do
a differential heat on it,

09:31.697 --> 09:34.406

09:58.890 --> 10:00.432
<i> Put a rough profile</i>

- Whoa.
- Whoa.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.898
In the oil.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.984
So Nathan has quenched.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.653
- Not in the wa--don't do it in
the w--don't do it, don't do it.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.363
Agh.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.532

<i> ¶ ¶</i>

10:20.245 --> 10:21.453
Ugh.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.704
Nathan doing that quench
in the oil

10:22.748 --> 10:24.039
and then going
right into the water

10:24.082 --> 10:25.415
does not bode well.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.750
Not letting it cool off enough,

10:26.793 --> 10:28.209
putting it in the water,

10:28.253 --> 10:29.836
there's a good possibility

10:29.880 --> 10:33.548
he put a bunch of stress
fractures in that right now.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.884
- Oh.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.218
I think I'm [bleep].

10:37.262 --> 10:39.888
- Huh?
- I think I'm [bleep].

10:44.853 --> 10:46.770
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

10:46.813 --> 10:49.022
- Oh.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.357
I think I'm [bleep].

10:50.400 --> 10:52.359
- Huh?
- I think I'm [bleep].

10:52.402 --> 10:55.695
- Got some head-shaking from
Nathan going on in the corner.

10:55.739 --> 11:00.200
- I think I got cracks
all over mine.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.285
There's like
a [bleep] billion.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.038
- So Nathan has a crack

11:05.082 --> 11:07.040
almost all the way across

11:07.084 --> 11:08.917
the edge of the blade.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.251
- I certainly don't have time

11:10.295 --> 11:11.878
to forge another blade
at this point.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.421
Bunch of cracks.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.091
So I had this idea
that I can just grind it out

11:16.134 --> 11:17.759
and leave a chunk
at the edge.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.552
It might grind out.
I don't know.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.970
- Yeah, grind 'em out.
You'll be all right.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.931
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:22.974 --> 11:24.974
- As I'm grinding the blade,
I'm having an internal argument

11:25.018 --> 11:27.394
of whether or not
I want to etch it.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.063
<i> Etching it</i>
<i> will really make it pop,</i>

11:30.107 --> 11:32.565
<i> but I'm also a little bit</i>
<i> nervous that if I etch it,</i>

11:32.609 --> 11:35.902
it will really show off
any weld flaw.

11:35.946 --> 11:40.657
<i> Finally I decide</i>
<i> I'm just going to go for it.</i>

11:40.701 --> 11:43.910
- So,
Ben is etching his blade.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.245
<i> - I pull it out.</i>

11:45.288 --> 11:47.664
I look at it,
and you can see,

11:47.708 --> 11:49.749
<i> clear as day,</i>

11:49.793 --> 11:51.960
the weld line
is solid and nice.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.420
<i> I'm very happy.</i>

11:53.463 --> 11:55.922
- You have 15 minutes
to finish you work.

little finish clean-up sanding.

I wish he'd just get done
with it and quench.

12:06.977 --> 12:10.478
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

12:10.522 --> 12:13.273
- I quench.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.442
<i> I pull out the blade</i>
<i> from the quench,</i>

12:15.485 --> 12:18.278

12:18.321 --> 12:19.821
<i> This is not good.</i>

I just have to go with it.

<i> - I'm kind of worried that</i>

13:10.832 --> 13:13.541
- Bladesmiths,
your first round challenge

13:13.585 --> 13:16.711
was to salvage steel
from a pile of welded scrap

13:16.755 --> 13:19.297
to forge a signature blade
of your own design.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.509
Now it's time for the judges
to inspect your work.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.470
Brent, please present
your weapon to the judges.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.430
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

13:27.474 --> 13:29.057
<i> - You got this</i>
<i> nice and lean</i>

13:29.100 --> 13:30.642
<i> before you went</i>
<i> to a grinder.</i>

13:30.685 --> 13:32.685
<i> You've almost got</i>
<i> an edge on there,</i>

13:32.729 --> 13:35.814
and the style design--
it looks great.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.440
- J.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.026
- Well, Brent, you got
quite a warp in this blade.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.153
<i> - Did not have time</i>
<i> to take it out.</i>

13:42.197 --> 13:44.906
<i> - Went back to the grinder</i>
<i> after the heat treat</i>

13:44.950 --> 13:46.741
and clean this up
as opposed to

13:46.785 --> 13:49.035
trying to fix that warp
in that amount of time.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.203
- That's right.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.996
- Okay.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.082
Why?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.458
- I didn't want to present

13:55.502 --> 13:58.878
a dirty, scaly,
greasy blade.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.255
- I don't mind
dirty and greasy...

14:00.298 --> 14:01.464
- Mm-hmm.
- But I like straight blades.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.009
- Indeed.
- All right, thank you.

<i> - Well, Tom, you've</i>
<i> definitely got a chopper here.</i>

14:11.101 --> 14:13.309

<i> have been dying to see</i>

<i> somebody actually doing</i>
<i> an edge quench with a torch.</i>

14:16.106 --> 14:18.022
You want to tell me
what your mindset with that?

14:18.066 --> 14:20.233
- Well,
I made it tough enough

14:20.277 --> 14:22.652
to cut a quarter-inch bolt
in two.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.613
[soft laughter]

14:25.657 --> 14:27.949
- Thank you.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.784
- Saw you do
a lot of hand work.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.579
Wound up putting just
a little bit of a curve in there

14:32.622 --> 14:35.123
<i> and fighting</i>
<i> that one spot,</i>

14:35.166 --> 14:36.749
<i> but, altogether,</i>

14:36.793 --> 14:39.168
looks good, feels good.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.587
- Ben.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.172
Please present your blade
to the judges.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.924
<i> - You know, Ben,</i>

14:44.968 --> 14:46.426
<i> you decided to go more complex</i>
<i> than everybody else</i>

14:46.469 --> 14:48.303
<i> on the round one challenge.</i>

14:48.346 --> 14:49.762
<i> Kudos for that.</i>

14:49.806 --> 14:51.347
<i> And you still had time</i>
<i> to acid etch it,</i>

14:51.391 --> 14:53.308
<i> bringing up these layers.</i>

14:53.351 --> 14:54.934
Beautiful.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.102
- Well done, sir.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.604
- Dave.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.523
- Now, you've got a bit
of a bend in that blade.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.317
<i> - Yeah, a tiny bit, yeah.</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:04.277
<i> - Why didn't you deal with</i>
<i> that bend at all?</i>

15:04.321 --> 15:05.945
<i> - To be honest,</i>
<i> as I kept looking at it,</i>

15:05.989 --> 15:08.531
it was straight and then
I was just grinding it,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.325
and I think I actually
ground a belly in it.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.868
- Oh, you--you dished it?
Okay.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.245
Looks good.
- Thank you.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.790
- Nathan, you're up next.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.876
<i> - Well, Nathan,</i>
<i> quite a large chunk of steel</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:21.794
<i> to work with</i>
<i> right off the bat.</i>

15:21.838 --> 15:23.463
<i> But you did</i>
<i> work it down nicely</i>

15:23.506 --> 15:25.632
and you got it moving
quite well,

15:25.675 --> 15:29.177
but apparently we had
an issue here.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.304
- Yeah, a pretty large crack
showed up.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.306
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

15:33.350 --> 15:34.974
<i> - You did one of the things</i>

15:35.018 --> 15:36.851
<i> that gives all of us</i>
<i> the chills up here.</i>

15:36.895 --> 15:38.478
You quenched in oil,

15:38.521 --> 15:40.688
and then went pretty much
immediately to the water

15:40.732 --> 15:42.774
with steel that was still hot

15:42.817 --> 15:46.110
and that's where
the cracking issue happens.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.405
I can see two large cracks

15:49.449 --> 15:51.616
<i> going across the spine.</i>

15:51.660 --> 15:53.993
<i> A few smaller ones,</i>
<i> and plus, we've actually got</i>

15:54.037 --> 15:57.330
lateral cracking
going right down here.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.790
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:58.833 --> 16:02.085
- That's--that's
a very big issue.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.503
- Doug.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.171
- Well, Nathan,
you knew what the test was,

16:05.215 --> 16:06.506
you built something for that.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.174
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.218 --> 16:12.095
- But you can't deny
that the cracks are in there

16:12.138 --> 16:14.389
on this particular blade.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.225
There are so many,
I would not feel comfortable

16:17.268 --> 16:19.519

16:19.562 --> 16:21.187

17:31.426 --> 17:33.676
You can use that time
to address any flaws or issues

17:33.720 --> 17:36.262
that the judges identified
in your blades

17:36.306 --> 17:38.931
but keep in mind,
the time runs out,

17:38.975 --> 17:41.434
one of you must
surrender his weapon

17:41.478 --> 17:42.935
and leave the Forge.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.937
Good luck, bladesmiths.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.106
Your time starts now.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.941
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

17:48.985 --> 17:51.110
- [imitates gunshot]

17:51.154 --> 17:52.862
And they're off to the races.

17:52.906 --> 17:56.115
- All of our smiths
have already pre-drilled

17:56.159 --> 17:57.950
holes onto their tang,

17:57.994 --> 18:01.079
so I really want to see some
beautiful, finished handles

18:01.122 --> 18:03.289
on these blades.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.957
- I choose the red micarta.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.459
It's a really strong material.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.002
I know it's going to be
a really strong handle.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.463
<i> But first thing I want</i>
<i> to get out of the way</i>

18:10.507 --> 18:12.298
is to fix the issues

18:12.342 --> 18:14.133
that the judges had
with the knife.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.136
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

18:17.180 --> 18:20.681
- Looks like Ben might actually
be addressing his blade issue.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.600
<i> - I could kill two birds</i>
<i> with one stone.</i>

18:22.644 --> 18:24.185
<i> I could grind it</i>
<i> more straight</i>

18:24.229 --> 18:26.145
and I could also
take off some of the weight

18:26.189 --> 18:28.189
that they had issue with.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.066
- Very nice to see him
take that down.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.068
Right now, it is
really blade-heavy.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.320
- Yeah.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.988
<i> - As it gets</i>
<i> a little trimmed down,</i>

18:36.032 --> 18:38.658
it starts to feel
racy and sexy and fast.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.160
I really think it's gonna be
a heck of a chopper.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.870
- Gonna make
a pretty handle here.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.541
All about the fit and finish.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.167
- Brent's got
the alternative ivory

18:48.211 --> 18:50.419
plus a blue piece
of spacer material.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.088
- And brass, too,
it looks like.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.173
Put a brass guard on.
- Yeah.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.716
<i> - When it comes</i>
<i> to fit and finish,</i>

18:55.760 --> 18:58.052
I'm kind of a little bit
of a perfectionist.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.513
<i> I've decided to make</i>
<i> a composite handle</i>

19:00.557 --> 19:02.181
<i> out of more</i>
<i> than one material</i>

19:02.225 --> 19:05.935
so that I can show the judges
what I'm worth.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.186
- Oh, that would be nice.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.771
The black brass,
the blue, the white.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.191
- But Brent has such an extreme
curve, and that blade,

19:12.235 --> 19:14.902
I want to see him
straighten that out.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.238
<i> - I know it's a gamble</i>
<i> to heat the blade again</i>

19:17.282 --> 19:19.824
<i> in order to straighten</i>
<i> the blade.</i>

19:19.868 --> 19:21.033
<i> I'm a little concerned,</i>

19:21.077 --> 19:22.368
but I know I have to push it

19:22.412 --> 19:23.870
to get to the next round.

19:23.913 --> 19:30.918
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

19:30.962 --> 19:33.462
- Have you noticed the color
in the center of Brent's blade?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.590
- Yes, I did. Yeah. Yeah.
- [laughs]

19:35.633 --> 19:37.550
There's little to no hardness

19:37.594 --> 19:39.260
right in the center
of Brent's blade now.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.221
- Grays and blacks
you really don't want to see.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.223
- I--I just can't look
at Brent's blade anymore.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.266
Ugh.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.978
- I know, it's a worry.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.731
And Tom is shaping
right there.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.066
- Yeah. Tom's moving
right along.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.443
- There's a lot more
to knife-making

19:55.486 --> 19:57.570
than just heating
a piece of steel,

19:57.614 --> 20:00.114
sticking it in oil.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.908
- I see a lot
of sparks over there.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.576
- I hope he's keeping it cool.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.119
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:05.163 --> 20:07.997
There he goes.
Good, he's cooling it.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.166
What we've seen throughout
this competition

20:10.210 --> 20:13.252
with Tom is smart work.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.421
- Well, when you've got
that many years experience,

20:15.465 --> 20:19.091
you learn to work smarter
instead of harder.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.595
- Bladesmiths, you have
90 minutes remaining.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.138
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:24.182 --> 20:27.475
- Man, that went faster
than the hot rakes round.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.143
- As long as I can
get this handle on,

20:29.187 --> 20:30.394
I'll have
a functional weapon,

20:30.438 --> 20:33.105
and that's what
I'm looking for.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.440
- That's a cool-looking handle,

20:34.484 --> 20:36.234
if he contours that correctly.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.153
- Mm-hmm, that'd be
very nice.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.655
<i> - I've got to get</i>
<i> the handle shaped</i>

20:40.698 --> 20:42.365
so that I can smooth it out
and polish it

20:42.408 --> 20:45.785
<i> so I can move on to get</i>
<i> the blade looking better.</i>

20:45.828 --> 20:47.620
I got the bend out
earlier, which I was

20:47.664 --> 20:49.288
really excited about.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.831
I feel like
it's quite straight now.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.833
- [laughter]

20:52.877 --> 20:54.460
Looks like
a very sporty handle.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.462
- We'll see
if the blade's still soft,

20:56.506 --> 20:59.048
it's gonna be a sporty car
without any tires.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.299
- It's coming out pretty.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.176
- I just find it
hard to comprehend

21:02.220 --> 21:03.678
that Brent has no idea

21:03.721 --> 21:07.473
that he's got
a soft center.

21:07.517 --> 21:08.641
- Ah.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.519
That's what I was afraid of.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.229
That ain't gonna work.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.856
- Yeah, Tom's been
mucking around with these pins

21:15.900 --> 21:17.191
for a while now.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.485
I think he's trying
to get them out.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.861
It's hard to read Tom

21:20.905 --> 21:23.990
because he doesn't
get flustered.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.158
- Punch 'em out with these.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.660
- It's all hidden
under the moustache.

21:27.704 --> 21:28.828
It's there, though.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.998
- I had a pin grind off.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.875
I'm having to change 'em out.

21:34.919 --> 21:38.838
May not go.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.506
That looks like crap.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.342
<i> This is not working out</i>
<i> very well.</i>

21:43.386 --> 21:44.719
There's no knocking
the front one out

21:44.762 --> 21:46.846
<i> without ruining</i>
<i> the whole handle,</i>

21:46.889 --> 21:50.349
and I don't have enough time
to start over.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.018
Whoa.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.399
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

21:58.443 --> 22:03.029
- I had a pin, uh,
grind off.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.864
I'm having to change 'em out.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.741
There's no knocking
the front one out

22:06.784 --> 22:08.659
without ruining
the whole handle,

22:08.703 --> 22:12.330
and I don't have
enough time to start over.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.914
Whoa.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.750
- Oof, and thank God
that was just a screwdriver,

22:15.793 --> 22:17.209
Not a knife or a finger.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.295
- Hope we got on that--
got that on slo-mo.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.881
- That ain't coming out,
I know.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.550
That front one
may just have to be--

22:24.594 --> 22:27.762
I choose to just go ahead
and leave one bolt in it

22:27.805 --> 22:29.555
without the head
of the screw showing.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.891
It'll be functional
and everything,

22:31.934 --> 22:35.144
but it won't be
like I wanted it.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.813
I'm anxious to see
how it holds up.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.565
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:39.609 --> 22:41.150
- It's gonna get
a little dusty, y'all.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.735
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:42.779 --> 22:44.737
<i> - I want the handle</i>
<i> to feel like</i>

22:44.781 --> 22:47.448
you're not gonna lose control
of it if you start swinging.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.408
- It worries me
a little bit

22:49.452 --> 22:51.786
that Ben's handle
is so small

22:51.829 --> 22:53.579
compared to his knife.

22:53.623 --> 22:57.750
Hopefully he's taken
a lot of weight off of that.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.127
- I paid attention when
I shook the hands of the judges

23:00.171 --> 23:02.755
<i> and tried to size up</i>
<i> what kind of hands they had,</i>

23:02.799 --> 23:05.049
<i> so I think if it feels</i>
<i> comfortable to me,</i>

23:05.093 --> 23:06.634
<i> it'll feel comfortable</i>
<i> to them.</i>

23:06.677 --> 23:08.511
- Five minutes!

23:08.554 --> 23:09.595
- Whoo, Lord.

23:09.639 --> 23:12.598
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:12.642 --> 23:16.394
This is a lot of blade
to sharpen.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.438
<i> I want to just put</i>
<i> a final sheen onto the handle,</i>

23:19.482 --> 23:21.023
so I decided,

23:21.067 --> 23:22.233
<i> ah, I know</i>
<i> where there's some grease.</i>

23:22.276 --> 23:23.776
- Ah, love it.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.319
<i> - I just took some</i>
<i> from inside of my nose</i>

23:25.363 --> 23:28.989
and put it on the handle
and it made a nice polish.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.575
- Ten, nine,

23:31.619 --> 23:33.786
eight, seven,

23:33.830 --> 23:35.621
six, five,

23:35.665 --> 23:37.373
four, three,

23:37.417 --> 23:39.500
two, one.

23:39.544 --> 23:43.796
Time's up, gentlemen,
please stop working.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.090
- It's a hell of a time.
[laughs]

23:46.134 --> 23:48.300
- I don't know.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.469
<i> - I'm not feeling</i>
<i> as confident as I was</i>

23:50.513 --> 23:52.346
that I'll go to round three.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.140
<i> I hope they're really</i>
<i> blown away by the handle,</i>

23:54.183 --> 23:56.225
but they may be
a little concerned

23:56.269 --> 23:58.894
that it's a little light
or lighter than the others.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.856
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

24:01.899 --> 24:04.150
- Smiths, welcome
to our strength test,

24:04.193 --> 24:05.651
the dowel chop.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.153
I'm gonna take
each of your blades

24:07.196 --> 24:08.487
and attempt to chop through

24:08.531 --> 24:09.780
these three
different-sized dowels.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.366
I'll be doing ten chops
for each blade.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.993
Ben, you're up.
Are you ready?

24:14.036 --> 24:15.161
- I hope so.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.829
<i> I'm extremely nervous</i>

24:16.873 --> 24:18.372
<i> to see how it's going to do</i>
<i> in the test.</i>

24:18.416 --> 24:19.748
<i> I've seen J.</i>
<i> swing a knife before,</i>

24:19.792 --> 24:23.878
and he can really
hurt some stuff.

<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:32.221 --> 24:35.514
<i> [inquisitive music]</i>

24:35.558 --> 24:38.058
- You did blow through that
first dowel pretty easily,

24:38.102 --> 24:40.352
and you got about halfway
through the second one as well.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.022
You do have
a couple burrs on your edge,

24:43.065 --> 24:45.733
so maybe it's not quite as hard
as we would have liked,

24:45.776 --> 24:48.611
but it did perform
very well.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.238
<i> [rock music]</i>

24:51.282 --> 24:52.615
<i> Tom, you're up.</i>
<i> You ready?</i>

24:52.658 --> 24:55.034
- I'm ready, sir.

24:55.077 --> 25:03.042
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:05.922 --> 25:07.546
- Your edge held up beautifully.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.715
Got right through
that first dowel no problem,

25:09.759 --> 25:11.133
and I'd say probably

25:11.177 --> 25:12.885
a third of the way
through the second one.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.387
Good job.
- Thank you.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.806
<i> [inquisitive music]</i>

<i> - Brent, it's your turn.</i>
<i> Are you ready?</i>

25:18.893 --> 25:20.476
- Let's do it.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.062
My blade came out more thin
than the other blades,

25:23.105 --> 25:26.607
<i> so I'm a little concerned</i>
<i> my blade will bend or break.</i>

25:57.848 --> 26:00.015
- Brent, you went through
that first dowel no problem.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.976
Bit nicely into
the second one,

26:02.019 --> 26:05.396
but we definitely
have waves in the blade.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.898
Your edge
is not straight anymore.

26:07.942 --> 26:11.819
You got
some serious ripples.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.280
I'm gonna pass you off
to Doug.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.032

if your weapon held its edge,

26:17.076 --> 26:18.659
I will cut through
this fish.

- Well, Ben,
as you can see,

26:32.508 --> 26:35.801
it sliced nicely
all the way through.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.344
Your handle construction,

26:37.388 --> 26:40.139
a little on the smaller side
but it felt good.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.974
This, sir, will cut.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.018
- Awesome.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.854
- Tom, it's your turn.
You ready?

26:46.897 --> 26:49.982
<i> - I feel like my blade</i>
<i> will hold up real well.</i>

26:50.026 --> 26:52.568
It'll cut
what it's supposed to cut.

26:52.612 --> 26:59.491
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:59.535 --> 27:01.660
- Well, Tom, cut nicely.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.705
You actually got also a very
good recovery on your blade.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.707
For this test, sir,
it will cut.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.334
- Thank you.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.502
- Brent, you're up. You ready?
- Yes, indeed.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.505
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

27:13.549 --> 27:18.093
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:20.262
- Brent,
sliced through cleanly.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.390
The balance feels good
'cause it's a lighter blade.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.559
Your handle construction,
though beautiful,

27:25.603 --> 27:27.561
a little bit
on the slippery side, though.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.813
Overall though,
it will cut.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.774
- Yes.

27:31.817 --> 27:32.858
<i> [tense music]</i>

27:32.902 --> 27:34.360
- Bladesmiths,

27:34.403 --> 27:37.029
unfortunately only two of you
may move forward

27:37.073 --> 27:39.198
in to the final round
of competition.

27:39.241 --> 27:42.117
It's time for one of you
to leave the forge.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.704
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:45.748 --> 27:49.041
Brent, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.126
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

27:51.170 --> 27:53.295
- Brent, you came
into the second challenge

27:53.339 --> 27:55.881
with an extreme warp
in your blade.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.216
<i> When you went to straighten,</i>

27:57.259 --> 27:59.093
<i> you heated up</i>
<i> the center section</i>

27:59.136 --> 28:01.053
<i> and you lost</i>
<i> a lot of your hardness.</i>

28:01.097 --> 28:02.388
<i> It's a cardinal sin.</i>

28:02.431 --> 28:04.473
When heating that spine,
you let that heat travel

28:04.517 --> 28:06.558
all the way to the edge,
and that really puts

28:06.602 --> 28:08.560
the strength of your blade's
edge in question.

28:08.604 --> 28:12.231
You can see it compacting on
the edge from the strength test,

28:12.274 --> 28:15.067
and that's why
we have to let you go.

28:15.111 --> 28:18.070
- Brent,
please surrender your weapon.

28:18.114 --> 28:20.072
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:20.116 --> 28:22.366
<i> - I'm pretty disappointed</i>
<i> that I'm eliminated,</i>

28:22.410 --> 28:24.827
but ultimately, I agree
with the judges' decision.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.621
<i> My blade took the most damage</i>
<i> during the testing,</i>

28:27.665 --> 28:29.331
<i> and that cutting edge</i>

28:29.375 --> 28:32.501
<i> is the most important,</i>
<i> critical part of the blade.</i>

28:32.545 --> 28:34.795
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:34.839 --> 28:37.089
- Ben, Tom,
congratulations.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.133
You've made it to
the "Forged in Fire" final.

28:39.176 --> 28:40.801
When you came here,

28:40.845 --> 28:42.761
we asked you to use
our equipment and our tools

28:42.805 --> 28:45.431
to forge a signature blade
of your own design,

28:45.474 --> 28:48.350
and now we're sending you
back to your home forges

28:48.394 --> 28:53.272
to re-create
an iconic weapon from history:

28:53.315 --> 28:54.606
the khanda.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.191
- Whoo!

28:56.235 --> 28:58.610
-<i> The khanda is a sword</i>
<i> that gained popularity</i>

28:58.654 --> 29:00.988
<i> in medieval India</i>
<i> during the Gupta period</i>

29:01.031 --> 29:03.907
<i> between 320 and 550 AD.</i>

29:03.951 --> 29:06.785
<i> The word khanda is derived</i>
<i> from the Sanskrit word</i> khand,

29:06.829 --> 29:10.873
<i> meaning to break,</i>
<i> divide, cut, or destroy.</i>

29:10.916 --> 29:12.958
<i> Its wide, thick,</i>
<i> straight blade</i>

29:13.002 --> 29:14.960
<i> was not only used</i>
<i> for thrusting,</i>

29:15.004 --> 29:17.296
<i> but also as</i>
<i> a hacking weapon.</i>

29:17.339 --> 29:20.299
<i> When a Rajput warrior</i>
<i> was surrounded by the enemy,</i>

29:20.342 --> 29:22.593
<i> he would pull out the khanda</i>
<i> and fight to the end</i>

29:22.636 --> 29:24.636
<i> while swinging the blade</i>
<i> with both hands,</i>

29:24.680 --> 29:27.181
<i> taking down as many enemies</i>
<i> as he could</i>

29:27.224 --> 29:30.684
<i> in an honorable last stand.</i>

29:30.728 --> 29:34.521
It has to be an authentic,
working replica

29:34.565 --> 29:36.565
of that deadly weapon.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.317
- The mystery weapon's
a khanda.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.486
<i> I think it's</i>
<i> a real do-able blade.</i>

29:40.529 --> 29:42.863
<i> I believe I can produce one.</i>

29:42.907 --> 29:44.573
- The blades themselves
must fall within

29:44.617 --> 29:46.074
the following parameters:

29:46.118 --> 29:47.284
the length of the blade

29:47.328 --> 29:50.245
must be between
29 and 31 inches,

29:50.289 --> 29:53.332
and they must also
include a khanda guard.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.543
- I'm extremely nervous having
to do a sword of that length,

29:56.587 --> 29:58.629
knowing that they're gonna
put it through its paces

29:58.672 --> 30:01.215
and I have to make something
pretty, tough,

30:01.258 --> 30:03.091
and...tough.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.094
- Gentlemen, you will have
five days at your home forge

30:06.138 --> 30:07.805
to complete this challenge.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.890
After the five days,
you will return to this forge

30:09.934 --> 30:12.601
and present your khandas
to our judges

30:12.645 --> 30:17.022
who will then put them through
a series of brutal tests.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.565
Only after those tests
are completed

30:18.609 --> 30:20.359
will they declare
one of you

30:20.402 --> 30:22.236
the "Forged in Fire" champion

30:22.279 --> 30:25.781
and the recipient
of the $10,000 check.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.866
Bladesmiths, good luck.

<i> [rock music]</i>

30:32.414 --> 30:33.372

30:33.415 --> 30:34.873
-<i> So it's day one.</i>

30:34.917 --> 30:37.376
<i> My strategy going into</i>
<i> building this blade</i>

30:37.419 --> 30:39.419
<i> is that I'm going to make</i>
<i> a couple of test blades.</i>

30:39.463 --> 30:42.047
We're just making a smaller
billet of the same Damascus

30:42.091 --> 30:44.466
so I can test out
some heat treating options

30:44.510 --> 30:46.093
and see how tough
I can make it,

30:46.136 --> 30:47.678
'cause if anything breaks
I'd rather it be

30:47.721 --> 30:49.680
this than the real one.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.431
<i> The most crucial part</i>
<i> of this build</i>

30:51.475 --> 30:53.267
<i> is whatever I have to do</i>
<i> to get it through the testing.</i>

30:53.310 --> 30:54.601
<i> I can make the prettiest thing</i>
<i> in the world.</i>

30:54.645 --> 30:56.562
If it snaps in two,
I'm gonna lose.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.231
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

30:59.275 --> 31:00.816
[bleep]

31:01.819 --> 31:03.235
That's horrible.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.571
Perfectly horrible.

31:05.614 --> 31:06.738
See the size of those grains?

31:06.782 --> 31:07.906
They're like grains of sugar.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.241
That's what we don't want.

31:09.285 --> 31:10.409
And you saw how easily
it snapped.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.577
See if we can fix it.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.912
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:13.956 --> 31:15.914
<i>- It feels good to be back home</i>

31:15.958 --> 31:19.209
<i> where I have my own equipment.</i>
There we go.

31:19.253 --> 31:21.962
Today I'm gonna try and get
the shapes of the guard

31:22.006 --> 31:24.506
and gettin' the blade ground.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.174
<i> The blade we had to make</i>

31:26.218 --> 31:29.344
<i> is designed</i>
<i> for fightin' double-handed</i>

31:29.388 --> 31:31.179
and it had
a big D-guard on it

31:31.223 --> 31:34.600
<i> and I'd never done that.</i>

31:34.643 --> 31:38.437
It's quite a awesome blade.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.939
This blade is
a lot about balance

31:40.983 --> 31:43.984
and not being heavy,
but being strong.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.612
I've got to lighten
this blade way up.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.447
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:48.490 --> 31:51.867
This is perfect.
A flaw in the steel.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.625
That's bad news for this.

<i> and shaped.</i>

32:07.009 --> 32:08.634
<i> I got a lot of things</i>
<i> I have to get done,</i>

32:08.677 --> 32:10.969
and it's crucial that
all of them get done today

32:11.013 --> 32:12.429
because I'm
running out of tomorrows.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.639
[exhales sharply]

32:13.682 --> 32:15.641

32:23.359 --> 32:24.733
<i> Very excited</i>
<i> about that.</i>

32:24.777 --> 32:27.527
That makes for
a very tough blade.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.279
<i> Now I have to dive into</i>
<i> the handle.</i>

32:29.323 --> 32:31.156
<i> The handle is nothing like</i>
<i> I've ever seen before.</i>

32:31.200 --> 32:33.325
There's a lot of parts and they
all have to fit together

32:33.369 --> 32:35.160
and they're confusing handle.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.209
Seems to be going
real good,

32:42.252 --> 32:44.044
<i> and I'm gonna try</i>
<i> and get the handle</i>

32:44.088 --> 32:46.838
<i> all put together before noon.</i>

32:46.882 --> 32:49.216
<i> I'm gonna have to look</i>
<i> at a picture again</i>

32:49.259 --> 32:51.218
to see what kind of handle
I'm gonna end up

32:51.261 --> 32:52.636
putting on this blade.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.680
<i> It's all I got to go by.</i>

32:54.723 --> 33:00.686
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:00.729 --> 33:05.273

<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:06.777 --> 33:09.027
Big mistake.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.196
The D-guard should be here,

33:11.240 --> 33:13.365
and I got it over here.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.201

<i> in a style that</i>
<i> I've never even seen before,</i>

33:34.638 --> 33:36.555
let alone made before.

33:36.598 --> 33:37.931
<i> Hardest part</i>
<i> of making this handle</i>

33:37.975 --> 33:39.433
<i> is to get it all</i>
<i> to fit just right,</i>

33:39.476 --> 33:41.309
<i> 'cause it is a complex handle.</i>

33:41.353 --> 33:43.687
<i> It's a lot of parts</i>
<i> that have to angle just right.</i>

33:43.731 --> 33:45.105
It's a lot more difficult
than I thought it would be.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.107
<i> I wrapped the handle</i>
<i> in leather.</i>

33:47.151 --> 33:49.651
<i> It'll bulk out the handle</i>
<i> and make it more comfortable</i>

33:49.695 --> 33:52.529
<i> so that it really kind of</i>
<i> holds your hand snugly</i>

33:52.573 --> 33:54.573
<i> and feels really good.</i>

33:54.616 --> 33:56.450
Holy cow.

What a long journey.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.412
I am super proud
of this weapon.

34:00.456 --> 34:02.539
I don't know how big
of a bag of tricks Tom has,

34:02.583 --> 34:04.082
but mine's pretty full,

34:04.126 --> 34:05.751

<i> ¶ ¶</i>

34:06.920 --> 34:08.754

<i> I had several things wrong</i>
<i> with the D-guard yesterday.</i>

34:11.842 --> 34:13.383
I got it fixed,

34:13.427 --> 34:16.303

<i> and tempered this blade</i>

<i> I'm grinding my blade</i>

it's way too soft.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.227
I'm gonna have to
re-harden this.

34:24.271 --> 34:27.314
There's a lot can go wrong
with the quench.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.690
Your blade can crack.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.068

35:13.403 --> 35:15.028
welcome back to the Forge.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.489
You've had five days at home
to work on your khandas.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.157
Ben, how did it go?

35:19.201 --> 35:21.076
- It's the longest blade
I've ever made,

35:21.120 --> 35:23.328
<i> and the grinding</i>
<i> was challenging,</i>

35:23.372 --> 35:24.871
<i> but, uh,</i>

35:24.915 --> 35:26.498
<i> I'm pretty happy</i>
<i> with the heat treat.</i>

35:26.542 --> 35:30.335
I'm excited to see--
well, some of the testing.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.711
- Tom, how'd it go?

35:31.755 --> 35:35.257
- Well, it was more
than a challenge.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.009
<i> I spent a lot of time</i>
<i> on the guard.</i>

35:38.053 --> 35:41.179
<i> The artwork isn't what</i>
<i> I'd like for it to be,</i>

35:41.223 --> 35:44.683
but I was thrilled to get
to bring a blade back to test.

35:44.726 --> 35:48.145
- Well, gentlemen,
your weapons look fantastic,

35:48.188 --> 35:50.605
but looks are secondary
to performance.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.858
We will now be putting
each of your weapons

35:52.901 --> 35:54.985
through three tests.

35:55.028 --> 35:57.529
Doug?

35:57.573 --> 35:59.739
- Bladesmiths,
this is a kill test.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.200
To test the lethality
and function of your weapon,

36:02.244 --> 36:04.911
I will take your weapon
and deliver three vertical chops

36:04.955 --> 36:07.205
and then a slice.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.707
Ben, you're up.
You ready?

36:08.750 --> 36:11.459
- Guess so.
Let's do this.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.961
I'm a little bit nervous.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.171
There's a lot
of bones in there,

36:14.214 --> 36:16.381
but the sword
is made to cut,

36:16.425 --> 36:18.383
so let's see it cut.

36:18.427 --> 36:26.474
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

36:29.104 --> 36:31.396
- Well, Ben, the damage
that your blade did

36:31.440 --> 36:35.275
cut about six inches deep
into both shoulders,

36:35.319 --> 36:37.569
and right through
the spine.

36:37.613 --> 36:38.945
On the horizontal slice,

36:38.989 --> 36:40.614
it pretty much cut
all the way through.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.408
It's got a good feel.

36:43.452 --> 36:47.329
This, sir, will kill.
- Thank you.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.288
- Tom, it's your turn.
You ready?

36:48.332 --> 36:49.581
- I'm ready.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.458
I don't like losing at all.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.585
I like to win.

36:53.629 --> 36:56.421
<i> In the kill test,</i>
<i> I think it's do-able.</i>

36:56.465 --> 36:59.257
I really do.

36:59.301 --> 37:06.681
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

37:08.310 --> 37:11.269
- Tom, it definitely cut in
about six inches deep

37:11.313 --> 37:12.938
on the shoulders

37:12.981 --> 37:16.608
and about eight inches
into the spinal column.

37:16.652 --> 37:19.319
It cut halfway through
into the carcass.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.321
Also feels good in balance

37:21.365 --> 37:24.157
with the downward
vertical slice.

37:24.201 --> 37:27.619
There was a slight bend
that's happening to your blade,

37:27.663 --> 37:29.329
but...

37:29.373 --> 37:32.499
it will kill.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.919
Bladesmiths,
this is the sharpness test.

37:35.963 --> 37:37.963
I will slash across
these bungee cords.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.631
If your blade is sharp,

37:39.675 --> 37:41.174
it should cut
all the way through.

37:41.218 --> 37:43.843
If not, it may just push it
aside or bounce off.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.971
Ben, you're up.
Are you ready?

37:46.014 --> 37:48.306
- Sure.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.642
<i> At this point, I'm nervous.</i>
<i> I don't know.</i>

37:50.686 --> 37:52.477
I don't know if I'm gonna
cut through all of them

37:52.521 --> 37:53.770
or if I'm gonna bounce off.

37:53.814 --> 37:56.314
<i> I have no idea.</i>

37:56.358 --> 38:04.281
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

38:04.324 --> 38:05.740
[bleep]

38:05.784 --> 38:08.660
- Well, Ben,
your sword started to cut.

38:08.704 --> 38:09.744
It cut a little bit,

38:09.788 --> 38:12.831
but it did not cut through.

38:12.874 --> 38:16.167
It feels good
on the slice.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.837
The handle is
very comfortable in the hand,

38:18.880 --> 38:21.006
but once again,
it didn't cut through,

38:21.049 --> 38:24.718
so it brings into question
the sharpness.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.011
Tom, it's your turn.
You ready?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.471
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

38:28.515 --> 38:31.182
<i> - I really feel comfortable</i>
<i> going into the test,</i>

38:31.226 --> 38:34.185
<i> and I know this blade's</i>
<i> gonna cut.</i>

38:34.229 --> 38:35.812
I'm ready.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.531
- Tom, it's your turn.
You ready?

38:46.575 --> 38:48.616
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.619
<i> [tense music]</i>

38:51.663 --> 38:56.374
- Ooh.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.043
- Well, Tom,

38:58.086 --> 39:01.379
it did cut a little bit
into the bungee cord,

39:01.423 --> 39:02.756
but then, as you can see...
- Yeah.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.507
- The transference of energy
went all the way

39:04.551 --> 39:06.051
back to the blade.
It wasn't sharp enough

39:06.094 --> 39:10.555
to cut through,
and it bent your blade

39:10.599 --> 39:12.140
<i> which brings to question</i>
<i> the heat treatment</i>

39:12.184 --> 39:13.808
<i> you did on your blade.</i>

39:13.852 --> 39:15.769
- Cut around corners now.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.979
- It'll cut around corners
this time, right?

39:18.023 --> 39:20.607
But, this particular case,

39:20.650 --> 39:23.151
it will not cut, sir.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.403
<i> - When you don't have your</i>
<i> hardening and tempering right</i>

39:25.447 --> 39:28.406
on the blade,
you don't have anything.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.075
- Gentlemen,
both of your weapons failed

39:30.118 --> 39:31.576
in the sharpness test.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.037
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

39:34.081 --> 39:36.456
Historically in battle,
blades bend.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.292
Tom, we'd like to give you
the opportunity

39:39.336 --> 39:40.794
to straighten your blade,

39:40.837 --> 39:43.254
so that you can continue
with this fight.

39:43.298 --> 39:46.716
However, we will be taking
that bend into consideration

39:46.760 --> 39:48.176
when it comes
to final judging.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.761
- I understand.

39:49.805 --> 39:54.307
Shoulda left it thicker,
but I'm not a quitter.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.934
<i> I'm gonna fight</i>
<i> to the end.</i>

39:55.977 --> 39:58.937
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

39:58.980 --> 40:01.523
- Okay, Tom,
you've straightened your blade.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.817
We can continue
with testing.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.151
Dave.

40:05.195 --> 40:08.321
- Gentlemen,
this is the strength test.

40:08.365 --> 40:11.783
I'm gonna take five chops
into these copper pipes

40:11.827 --> 40:14.619
and see how far through
we can split.

40:14.663 --> 40:19.165
Ben, are you ready?
- Not at all. Yes.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.877
The last thing I would bring
to a plumbing job is a sword,

40:22.921 --> 40:25.338
<i> so I'm just nervous</i>
<i> that, uh,</i>

40:25.382 --> 40:28.091
the blade'll break,
just snap in two.

40:28.135 --> 40:31.052
[exhales sharply]

40:31.096 --> 40:34.055

40:38.353 --> 40:39.436
[exhales]

40:40.856 --> 40:42.480
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

40:42.524 --> 40:44.482
- Well...

40:44.526 --> 40:49.070
Ben, it's still one piece,
but barely.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.906
And the--the dimensions
of your guard here

40:51.950 --> 40:54.325
on my hand are perfect.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.078
Your blade,
it's held up beautifully.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.872
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.457
- So, Tom, your turn.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.167
- Okay.
- All right.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.003
<i> - I'm really nervous</i>
<i> about the pipe cut.</i>

41:05.046 --> 41:07.505
I should have spent more time
on my blade,

41:07.549 --> 41:09.841
'cause that's what counts
in the end.

41:09.885 --> 41:11.509
- Now Tom, we do have
that bend in your blade

41:11.553 --> 41:13.178
and we know there's at least
a soft section of that.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.679
- Yeah.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.639
- So as I'm cutting,
if I feel that there's

41:16.683 --> 41:18.475
a point where it's unsafe,

41:18.518 --> 41:20.018
I'm just gonna stop,
all right?

41:20.061 --> 41:22.187
- Okay.

41:22.230 --> 41:29.444
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:29.488 --> 41:31.321
- So Tom,
what happened is we lost

41:31.364 --> 41:33.364
a piece of the guard
right there.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.408
- With the broken guard
and the bend earlier,

41:35.452 --> 41:38.036
I feel it's unsafe
to continue.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.371
All right, thank you, Tom.
- Mm-hmm.

41:40.415 --> 41:41.414
<i> I'm disappointed.</i>

41:41.458 --> 41:42.916
I know I could do better,

41:42.959 --> 41:45.126
<i> but that's what happens</i>

41:45.170 --> 41:47.045
when you don't
use your time right.

41:47.088 --> 41:50.173
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

41:50.217 --> 41:52.550
- Gentlemen,
in just five days,

41:52.594 --> 41:54.511
you've both done
an amazing amount of work

41:54.554 --> 41:56.012
on your khandas,

41:56.056 --> 41:58.515
but in this arena,
there can only be one

41:58.558 --> 42:00.225
"Forged in Fire" champion.

42:00.268 --> 42:03.770
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

42:03.813 --> 42:05.396
Ben...

42:05.440 --> 42:07.774
you are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.442
<i> [upbeat rock music]</i>

42:09.486 --> 42:10.985
Tom, unfortunately,

42:11.029 --> 42:13.112
your weapon
did not make the cut.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.614
- Tom, as I said before,

42:14.658 --> 42:17.242
<i> your attention to detail</i>
<i> was spot-on.</i>

42:17.285 --> 42:19.244
<i> It's just</i>
<i> that heat treat problem,</i>

42:19.287 --> 42:21.746
<i> with that blade</i>
<i> bending the way it did,</i>

42:21.790 --> 42:24.082
well, that's why
we have to let you go.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.293
- Tom, please surrender
your weapon.

42:27.337 --> 42:30.755
<i> - Well, I got to meet</i>
<i> some real nice craftsmen,</i>

42:30.799 --> 42:32.257
and, uh, I learned.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.093
<i> Don't let your age</i>
<i> slow you down.</i>

42:35.136 --> 42:36.803
<i> You don't know</i>
<i> how long you got.</i>

42:36.846 --> 42:38.763
- Ben, congratulations.

42:38.807 --> 42:40.306
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion

42:40.350 --> 42:43.101
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.978
Good job.
- Thank you.

42:45.021 --> 42:47.438
- Most people get
guard sizing all wrong,

42:47.482 --> 42:50.608
and the khanda has
a deceptively small guard.

42:50.652 --> 42:51.818
<i> You just hit it</i>
<i> out of the park.</i>

42:51.861 --> 42:53.653
- Thank you.

42:53.697 --> 42:55.613
<i> It feels amazing to be the</i>
<i> "Forged in Fire" champion.</i>

42:55.657 --> 42:58.616
It's a wonderful validation
of a long time of knife-making

42:58.660 --> 43:00.326
<i> and I made new friends.</i>

43:00.370 --> 43:02.453
I made ten grand, right?

43:02.497 --> 43:03.788
What more could you ask for?

43:03.832 --> 43:07.500
