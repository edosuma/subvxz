01:15.089 --> 01:19.079
That's… that's Greta Post.
Remember, from the female <i>Tool Time</i> ?

01:19.169 --> 01:22.919
- Yes. I do, Al.
- I think she wants me to ask her out.

01:23.010 --> 01:25.569
- How do you know that?
- She sent this backstage.

01:25.649 --> 01:29.159
It's got perfume on it,
and she's dotted her I's with hearts.

01:29.250 --> 01:33.240
- That is serious, Al. Go ask her out.
- I-I can't do that.

01:33.329 --> 01:36.520
- I'll ask her out for you.
- No. No. No, Tim.

01:37.609 --> 01:38.879
- No.
- Oh, relax.

01:38.970 --> 01:41.960
I was just going to go say,
"Greta, you melt Al's tool belt"

01:42.050 --> 01:45.280
Please. I'd like to do this
at my own pace.

01:45.369 --> 01:47.440
You don't have a pace.
You barely have a pulse.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.599
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

01:52.290 --> 01:57.359
Ladies and gentlemen, Binford Tools
is proud to present <i>Tool Time</i>.

01:59.530 --> 02:04.280
Hi, everybody, and welcome to <i>Tool Time</i>.
I'm Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor.

02:04.369 --> 02:07.440
Of course, this is
Al "the Available Man" Borland.

02:11.329 --> 02:13.889
Hey, Al, why don't you tell everybody
what's on the program today?

02:13.970 --> 02:17.639
All right. Today we'll be…

02:17.730 --> 02:23.440
we'll be showing you three easy steps
in how to build patio furniture.

02:23.530 --> 02:27.720
- Al, that will be on Friday's program.
- Today is Friday.

02:27.809 --> 02:31.510
No, today is Thursday,
the day that precedes Friday.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.440
Thursday? Thursday?

02:33.530 --> 02:36.359
He's right. That's right.
It's the day after Wednesday.

02:36.450 --> 02:40.359
Good golly. Looks like Al's got
a bit of that spring fever, huh?

02:40.450 --> 02:45.470
And spring is the time that a young man's
fancy turns to love and outdoor lighting.

02:45.569 --> 02:48.919
Yes, outdoor lighting can enhance
the back yard in a variety of ways.

02:49.010 --> 02:51.360
For example,
this is the type of lighting

02:51.400 --> 02:54.800
you want in your back yard
if you have a pool.

02:56.530 --> 03:01.280
And this is the type of lighting you want
if you have a patio.

03:02.609 --> 03:07.399
And this is the type of lighting you want
if you have a big monument.

03:13.770 --> 03:17.159
All right, Al, why don't we show the folks
the variety of lighting they can use.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.879
Coming right up, Tim.

03:18.970 --> 03:24.839
With this variety of lighting, you and your
family can romp through the back yard…

03:25.930 --> 03:29.159
pulling shards of glass
out of your bloody feet.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.639
Cut. Cut.
Let's reset and we'll take it from the top.

03:32.730 --> 03:36.760
- Al, come on. Get a hold of yourself.
- I'm sorry. I just…

03:36.849 --> 03:41.040
I caught Greta's eye and I got flustered,
but I'm fine now.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.800
I'm blocking her out of my mind.
There. She's gone.

03:43.889 --> 03:47.240
All right, get a broom.
Help me clean this up. We'll start again.

03:53.849 --> 03:57.240
- Hey, guys. What are you studying?
- Exponents and square roots.

03:57.329 --> 04:02.399
Ooh, math. I was a whiz in math
when I was in school.

04:03.129 --> 04:08.720
Do you suppose they call those square
roots because they're just not cool?

04:09.329 --> 04:11.710
- Dad?
- Uh-huh.

04:17.250 --> 04:21.599
- Jill, are you still digging through boxes?
- Tim, it's called spring cleaning.

04:21.690 --> 04:26.040
Jill, it's called "lug it away". You go through
the box, you pull out stuff, you say:

04:26.129 --> 04:29.399
"Oh, doesn't this bring back
fond memories?"

04:29.970 --> 04:34.559
Then you put it right back in the box
and have me lug it away.

04:34.649 --> 04:38.680
- Here, you big lug. Lug this.
- What's the magic word?

04:38.770 --> 04:41.599
No, that's "thank you".
"Please" is…

04:45.210 --> 04:49.119
Oh, honey, doesn't this
bring back fond memories?

04:49.210 --> 04:52.720
Look at this. This is us together
at that college spring dance.

04:52.809 --> 04:55.190
God. Look how long my hair was.

04:56.169 --> 04:58.879
Boy, was I ever a stud.

04:58.970 --> 05:02.800
Yeah. I think the operative word
there is "was".

05:04.089 --> 05:07.869
- I think I found your long hair.
- My fall. Let me see that.

05:07.970 --> 05:10.720
Don't touch it.
Look, it's moving…

05:19.169 --> 05:21.079
Saved!

05:21.169 --> 05:24.599
- What is this stuff?
- I don't know.

05:26.089 --> 05:28.000
- What's this?
- Nothing.

05:28.089 --> 05:31.359
- Looks like a diary.
- It's just my diary from college.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.639
There's nothing
that would interest you in here.

05:33.730 --> 05:39.559
Really? Hey, what about that steamy night
in Saugatuck we spent, huh?

05:39.649 --> 05:42.639
There might be one short paragraph.

05:42.730 --> 05:47.750
I bet it says something like.
"Tonight, I saw paradise."

05:47.849 --> 05:52.000
"And it was a very small island."

05:53.450 --> 05:56.720
How about our first date?
That's got to be in there. Read me that.

05:56.809 --> 06:00.760
Well. I have to admit
you swept me off my feet.

06:00.849 --> 06:06.240
That strolling violinist. The way you
climbed up to the second-floor dorm room

06:06.329 --> 06:09.559
and just stuck that note on my window…

06:09.649 --> 06:12.680
Whoa. I didn't do that.

06:12.770 --> 06:16.919
Yeah. You remember,
it was that same night that…

06:17.010 --> 06:18.760
Oh.

06:18.849 --> 06:20.399
Never mind.

06:25.690 --> 06:27.440
Hi, guys. What's so funny?

06:27.530 --> 06:30.240
Oh, nothing.
Just a naked baby picture of Brad.

06:30.329 --> 06:34.159
Let me see that.
Which end is his face?

06:35.809 --> 06:39.879
It's hard to tell.
They both look like they're smiling.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.319
- Where'd you guys get this?
- In that box of Mom's old stuff.

06:43.409 --> 06:45.790
Mom's old stuff, huh?

06:45.889 --> 06:48.559
You didn't see
a pink book in there, did you?

06:48.649 --> 06:51.639
You mean Mom's diary.
Yeah, it's under the pictures.

06:51.730 --> 06:55.720
This is your Mom's personal stuff. I don't
want you going in here without asking.

06:55.809 --> 06:58.109
- You hear me?
- OK.

06:59.409 --> 07:02.079
Don't go in.
That's personal things of people's.

07:02.169 --> 07:07.240
Stay out of their personal things.
You don't ever go in there.

07:09.210 --> 07:11.669
- What are you doing?
- Don't do that to me.

07:11.770 --> 07:16.480
- You were reading my diary.
- I was not. I didn't have enough time.

07:16.569 --> 07:19.129
I'm gonna take this
and put this someplace safer.

07:19.210 --> 07:21.510
I'll get it.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.440
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Randy.

07:24.530 --> 07:26.520
Hi, Al. Come on in.

07:27.649 --> 07:29.839
What's going on?

07:31.970 --> 07:37.760
I just wanted to apologize to you, man
to man, for screwing up on the show today.

07:37.849 --> 07:41.260
Well, Al, I accept your apology,
man to man.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.950
Hit the deck and give me 20.
Right now!

07:44.050 --> 07:46.720
I'm kidding, buddy.

07:46.809 --> 07:49.960
- Oh, hi, Al.
- Hi, Jill.

07:50.050 --> 07:53.159
I suppose Tim mentioned to you
how I embarrassed myself today.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.359
- No.
- You didn't?

07:54.450 --> 07:58.520
I embarrassed myself today
in front of Greta Post.

07:58.609 --> 08:03.000
- Greta Post?
- Yeah. She was on the female <i>Tool Time</i>.

08:03.089 --> 08:10.240
She wore a blue denim shirt on top of a
soft-pink T-shirt and silver dangle earrings.

08:10.329 --> 08:14.159
Blond hair, kind of shoulder-length,
with a dimple on her left…

08:14.250 --> 08:16.399
Al, it's not a police line-up.

08:17.409 --> 08:21.000
I remember Greta Post. She was adorable.
You should ask her out.

08:21.089 --> 08:22.760
- Well, I…
- He couldn't.

08:22.849 --> 08:25.230
- No.
- Why not?

08:25.329 --> 08:28.399
- Well, she's…
- She's something special.

08:31.450 --> 08:34.318
- So you feel a little nervous?
- Yeah.

08:35.770 --> 08:38.328
- You want some iced tea?
- Please.

08:38.409 --> 08:40.039
Yeah, thanks.

08:41.289 --> 08:47.200
It's just whenever I start to get serious
about a girl, it always ends up she says:

08:47.290 --> 08:50.990
"Gee, Al, I really like you,
but why can't we just be friends?"

08:51.089 --> 08:52.720
That must hurt.

08:52.809 --> 08:55.960
You know what your problem is?
You're too darn nice.

08:56.050 --> 08:58.720
I'm just trying to be
sensitive to their needs.

08:58.809 --> 09:02.040
I hate hearing that. Women always say
they want a sensitive man.

09:02.129 --> 09:05.359
Then they end up running off
with a kick boxer named Dolph.

09:05.450 --> 09:08.280
Women like primitive,
raw, wild men -

09:08.369 --> 09:11.040
a man with the sensuality of outdoors,
that kind of guy.

09:11.129 --> 09:13.720
The only reason I married you
is because you're so sensitive.

09:13.809 --> 09:16.599
Now, what's that supposed to mean?

09:19.409 --> 09:22.800
Al, don't listen to him.
Listen to me.

09:22.889 --> 09:29.399
Ask her out, take her some place to dinner
where you feel comfortable and relaxed.

09:29.490 --> 09:31.599
Maybe I could take her
to my mother's house.

09:31.690 --> 09:33.200
No, Al.

09:33.290 --> 09:38.409
Don't take her to your Mom's house
unless she's out of town.

09:41.050 --> 09:44.440
Oh, look, I got an idea. Why don't you
bring her over here Saturday night?

09:44.530 --> 09:46.800
We're just gonna have a cookout,
you know, just the family.

09:46.889 --> 09:49.079
Well, I wouldn't want to be any trouble.

09:49.169 --> 09:51.800
A little late for that, isn't it, Al?

09:51.889 --> 09:54.450
Shut up, Tim.
It's no trouble.

09:54.530 --> 09:58.309
You'll be relaxed, and that way
she'll get to see the real Al.

09:58.409 --> 10:01.599
A sad, lonely, broken man.

10:03.849 --> 10:06.149
I'm kidding, buddy.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.440
- Jeez! Watch it!
- Greta's here.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.960
- Great. Go ask her out.
- I was thinking maybe after the show…

10:17.050 --> 10:21.879
No, no, Al. Go ask her now. Tell her you
don't want to be just friends. Listen to me.

10:21.970 --> 10:26.559
Buck up. Show some mettle, man.
Don't ask her out. Tell her you're going out.

10:34.490 --> 10:36.319
- Greta.
- Yes, Al?

10:36.410 --> 10:38.439
Let's go out.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.439
- I'd like that.
- Good.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.240
- Al!
- Yeah?

10:43.330 --> 10:44.999
When?

10:45.649 --> 10:51.399
Oh, uh, gee… I don't know.
Whatever's convenient for you.

10:51.490 --> 10:54.720
If you'd like to check your calendar,
get back to me…

10:54.810 --> 10:57.720
- I'm happy to go out whenever you want.
- Whenever you want is fine…

10:57.810 --> 11:01.640
Greta. Tomorrow night, barbecue.
Taylor house. Six o'clock.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.999
That's perfect, Al.

11:04.089 --> 11:05.680
Good going, buddy.

11:05.769 --> 11:07.560
!.

11:07.649 --> 11:10.439
I'm free tonight.

11:10.530 --> 11:14.359
Well, uh… Gee, tonight's
not good for me, but maybe…

11:14.450 --> 11:16.439
Al, Al.

11:21.769 --> 11:24.439
Gather around, my sons.

11:26.249 --> 11:31.269
- What's up. Dad?
- Tonight, we put a carcass on the grill.

11:31.370 --> 11:37.359
oil up our bodies, put our loincloths on and
celebrate the first barbecue of the season.

11:38.490 --> 11:45.039
And you'll notice Daddy-o here has a
20-gallon steel cylinder filled with propane.

11:45.129 --> 11:50.560
I've increased the outlet valve of this mice.
Which means we'll be cooking with what?

11:50.649 --> 11:53.319
The fire department?

11:53.410 --> 11:56.120
Randy, Mark, get in here
and clean up this mess!

11:56.209 --> 11:58.999
You guys are in trouble.

12:00.609 --> 12:03.720
Well, Tim, beautiful spring day.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.399
How is the enchanting maiden Jill?

12:06.490 --> 12:08.200
"Enchanting maiden"?

12:08.289 --> 12:13.359
Just waxing poetic, Tim. I can't help it.
It's springtime - love is in the air.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.910
- Can you smell that?
- Does it smell like sausage?

12:18.010 --> 12:21.709
I'm talking about pollen
wafting from stamen to stigma.

12:21.810 --> 12:26.749
Looking to create new flowers,
fly, little pollen, fly. Create new life.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.120
Pollinate and propagate. Get down.

12:29.209 --> 12:32.990
Tim! I thought you said
you were gonna help me!

12:34.410 --> 12:37.200
There's the enchanting maiden now.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.600
See ya, Wilson.

12:43.089 --> 12:44.760
You bellowed, my maiden?

12:44.850 --> 12:48.160
Yeah, Al and Greta
are gonna be here in an hour, and…

12:51.129 --> 12:53.640
Would you put these boxes
in the garage for me?

12:53.729 --> 12:57.560
You bet.
Randy, give me a hand, will you?

12:57.649 --> 13:00.359
- My diary's not in there.
- I'm not looking for your diary.

13:00.450 --> 13:04.560
I saw you not looking for it.
You're not gonna find it because I hid it.

13:04.649 --> 13:07.160
And if by some chance you do find it.

13:07.249 --> 13:11.879
swear to me that you will not touch it.

13:11.970 --> 13:15.589
I swear on my son's head.
I will not touch your diary.

13:15.689 --> 13:17.160
And if I do…

13:17.249 --> 13:19.680
may he go bald.

13:21.930 --> 13:24.120
Right. Dad.

13:26.410 --> 13:30.680
- So. looks like you lost that diary forever.
- Really, hotshot?

13:30.769 --> 13:33.229
Take a look in the dryer.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.120
- There's nothing there.
- Look in the lint trap.

13:42.649 --> 13:44.319
Wow! How'd you know that?

13:44.410 --> 13:48.399
That's where she always hides stuff
she doesn't want me to find.

13:48.490 --> 13:51.800
- Here.
- No, no, no. I promised I wouldn't touch it.

13:55.930 --> 14:00.789
But that doesn't stop you from putting it out
and accidentally opening it up.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.319
Wait a second.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.970
This could be worth something.

14:07.370 --> 14:09.640
I could tell Mom about this.

14:09.729 --> 14:13.600
And I could duct-tape you to a ceiling fan
and force-feed you liver.

14:13.689 --> 14:16.800
How's "August 22. 1974"?

14:18.410 --> 14:20.839
Now, don't you read that. Back off.

14:20.930 --> 14:24.240
Oh, you can read this one.
This is cute. This is sweet.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.160
"Today I met the man I'm gonna marry."

14:27.249 --> 14:29.240
"Dan Lyons…?"

14:30.410 --> 14:33.080
Who the hell is Dan Lyons?

14:33.810 --> 14:36.039
Captain of the debate team.

14:36.129 --> 14:39.519
I told you, never go into your mother's
personal things. Ever, ever, ever!

14:39.609 --> 14:41.879
- Nice try, Tim.
- Ever!

14:41.970 --> 14:45.510
- You're in big trouble now. Dad.
- You're pathetic.

14:45.609 --> 14:48.640
And I'm upset.
You were gonna marry Dan Lyons?

14:48.729 --> 14:54.039
Come on, Tim, it was a long time ago. It
was way, way before I fell in love with you.

14:54.129 --> 14:56.430
- How "way"?
- Way, way before you.

14:56.530 --> 14:59.160
- Am I even in the book?
- No way.

14:59.249 --> 15:04.160
Of course you are. You're just not looking
in the right place. It was April…

15:04.609 --> 15:07.959
That's it. There.

15:08.050 --> 15:10.959
"Tonight I met the biggest…"

15:11.609 --> 15:14.479
- "Jerk."
- "..on campus.'

15:14.569 --> 15:17.919
Tim Taylor.
So, it was love at first sight, huh?

15:18.010 --> 15:20.240
Come on, Tim.
The first time I saw you.

15:20.330 --> 15:23.870
you were hanging from the roof of
the girls' dorm, swinging through the air

15:23.970 --> 15:29.959
with panties on your head, going.
"Send out the virgins to wax my loins."

15:34.050 --> 15:36.160
Oh, yeah.

15:39.850 --> 15:43.039
- Let me see it.
- face it. That was when we fell in love.

15:43.129 --> 15:47.959
No, it was not. Spring weekend
was when we fell in love. See here. Look.

15:48.050 --> 15:50.430
"Spring weekend was wonderful."

15:50.530 --> 15:56.479
"Friday I went to a movie with Tim, and
Saturday we went to the spring dance."

15:56.569 --> 15:59.760
"Tim spilled his boilermaker
down the front of my dress."

15:59.850 --> 16:05.039
- It wasn't my fault.
- "He can't dance, but he's a great kisser."

16:05.129 --> 16:10.600
"I know that Tim Taylor
is definitely the guy I'm going to marry."

16:10.689 --> 16:13.879
- See?
- "Him or Mitch Newon."

16:14.810 --> 16:19.039
That dress looks very pretty.
The color goes great with your skin tone.

16:19.129 --> 16:20.959
Well, thank you.

16:21.050 --> 16:25.800
Gee. I'm not used to getting all these
compliments in a house full of boys.

16:25.890 --> 16:28.680
I'm sure Bradley compliments you.

16:28.769 --> 16:30.720
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16:30.810 --> 16:35.200
Bradley is the one exception.
Where is he?

16:35.289 --> 16:38.280
He said he was gonna change his shirt
and wash up for dinner.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.479
Jennifer…

16:40.569 --> 16:43.760
you must come to this house more often.

16:46.689 --> 16:52.720
Yeah. The men are ready. Clean, preened,
ready to fill our spleens. Let's eat.

16:53.729 --> 16:56.359
- Jennifer, you want to go outside?
- Sure.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.319
- Something I said?
- Dad!

17:01.490 --> 17:03.789
What's with the kid?

17:03.890 --> 17:07.479
Well, Al and Greta, those mo wild
lovebirds, ought to be here any minute.

17:07.569 --> 17:11.560
- I hope it all goes well tonight.
- I think it's gonna go great.

17:11.648 --> 17:15.800
- I had a pep talk with Al on the phone.
- Oh. God. What did you tell him?

17:15.890 --> 17:21.280
I told him to go easy on that Mr Nice Guy
stuff, and if she says. "You're so sensitive".

17:21.369 --> 17:24.160
he should stand up for himself and
show her he's got some hair on his chest.

17:24.249 --> 17:25.680
Oh, Tim.

17:25.769 --> 17:29.080
Love is about to blossom.

17:29.169 --> 17:32.160
Come in, come in, come in.

17:32.249 --> 17:34.879
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's Al?

17:34.970 --> 17:36.189
I don't know.

17:36.289 --> 17:40.039
- Well, um, come on in. Sit down.
- Didn't you guys come together?

17:40.129 --> 17:43.830
Yeah. But I got out
and he just drove off.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.600
Greta, what happened?

17:45.689 --> 17:51.120
Well, we were on our way over here,
and we were having a nice talk.

17:51.209 --> 17:54.200
I told him he was a very sensitive man.

17:54.649 --> 17:57.240
Oh, no!

17:57.330 --> 18:00.999
Then he ripped open his shirt and said:

18:01.089 --> 18:03.760
"Hey. I've got hair on my chest."

18:07.970 --> 18:11.479
I started laughing
because I thought he was joking.

18:11.569 --> 18:17.640
Then his face turned red and he asked me
to get out, and that's when he drove off…

18:17.729 --> 18:19.959
howling.

18:29.450 --> 18:31.439
Hi, Al.

18:33.169 --> 18:34.839
Hi, Tim.

18:34.930 --> 18:37.800
How'd you know I was here?

18:39.649 --> 18:44.560
There's only mo places you go when
you're upset, and your mom wasn't home.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.439
It's her bingo night.

18:46.530 --> 18:50.720
I think when Greta decided to go out with
you, she kinda figured you'd be with her.

18:50.810 --> 18:53.999
I couldn't. I did what you said -

18:54.089 --> 18:58.319
I howled at the moon. I showed her the
hairs on my chest, and she laughed at me.

18:58.410 --> 19:01.560
You weren't actually supposed to show her
your chest. It's just a figure of speech.

19:01.649 --> 19:05.999
I'm not a wild man, Tim.
I'm not like you. I'm a nice guy.

19:07.850 --> 19:12.200
- Well, thank you.
- Well, that didn't… You know.

19:13.850 --> 19:17.959
I just… I wish there was a way
I could apologize to Greta.

19:18.050 --> 19:21.240
- I think there is, Al. Greta.
- She's here?

19:21.330 --> 19:24.870
- Yes, she's here.
- Oh, no! No!

19:26.729 --> 19:28.319
Hi, Al.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.200
Greta.

19:33.769 --> 19:36.399
I'm sorry I showed you my chest hairs.

19:37.410 --> 19:41.109
That's OK. I didn't really look.

19:42.209 --> 19:46.680
I… I guess this came about because
I'm very nervous about going out with you.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.640
You're nervous? I'm nervous too.

19:49.729 --> 19:52.959
- What do you have to be nervous about?
- Because…

19:53.050 --> 19:55.200
I've never been out
with a celebrity before.

19:55.289 --> 19:57.919
Well, me neither.

19:58.930 --> 20:01.310
- You mean me?
- Yeah.

20:02.249 --> 20:04.039
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.

20:04.129 --> 20:09.319
Well. I… I can see how that could
make you nervous. A celebrity.

20:10.810 --> 20:16.519
But you shouldn't let that bother you.
After all. I'm only an assistant celebrity.

20:23.769 --> 20:27.519
Boy. I wish… I wish we could
start this whole night over.

20:27.609 --> 20:29.399
Why don't we?

20:31.930 --> 20:34.640
There's something you need to know.

20:34.729 --> 20:37.519
If we go out on a date.

20:39.050 --> 20:42.640
I'm not interested in
being just good friends.

20:42.729 --> 20:46.959
I'm interested in
being something more.

20:49.330 --> 20:50.959
Me too.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.439
Oh.

21:01.729 --> 21:02.709
Tim!

21:02.810 --> 21:04.999
Yeah. I'm right here.
Jill's with me.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.229
Hi.

21:06.330 --> 21:11.800
Oh, gee, Jill…
I… I'm sorry I ruined the dinner.

21:11.890 --> 21:14.269
No, no, you didn't ruin the dinner.

21:14.370 --> 21:19.439
Maybe the mo of you should go off
somewhere together and enjoy yourselves.

21:19.530 --> 21:22.089
That's a good idea.

21:22.169 --> 21:24.200
Do you like bingo?

21:24.289 --> 21:27.039
Oh. I love bingo.

21:27.129 --> 21:29.720
That's wonderful.

21:32.609 --> 21:34.879
Bye'Bye!

21:36.609 --> 21:38.600
Thank you.

21:39.810 --> 21:41.680
You know.
I think she actually likes him.

21:41.769 --> 21:46.479
Oh, Tim. I told you.
Women love men that are sensitive.

21:46.569 --> 21:50.519
Don't start this now. You didn't marry me
because I was a sensitive man.

21:50.609 --> 21:54.039
- Yes. I did.
- Give me one example.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.150
OK. I will.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.430
Do you remember that spring weekend
when we went to the movies…

22:01.519 --> 22:05.630
and we went to Sangren Hall
and saw Doctor Zhivago?

22:05.720 --> 22:11.509
You know that scene when Lara and Dr
Zhivago say goodbye at the train station?

22:11.599 --> 22:17.150
I looked over at you and you had
a single tear roll down your cheek.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.230
That is when I fell in love with you.

22:21.519 --> 22:24.430
That was such a sad scene.

22:24.519 --> 22:27.710
- That's not why I was crying.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

22:28.599 --> 22:31.750
You finished all of my Milk Duds.

22:33.319 --> 22:37.950
Just the thought of that just
brings up so many bad memories.

22:40.799 --> 22:42.630
When are we gonna eat?
I'm starving.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.670
Yeah. Dad said the propane tank
would make it go faster.

22:45.759 --> 22:49.269
Just be patient.
He's doing the best he can.

22:49.359 --> 22:52.710
- Tim, how's it going out there?
- Great, honey. Just great.

22:52.799 --> 22:57.509
That… that new valve is really
forcing the gas right out of this thing.

22:57.599 --> 22:59.710
Holy…!.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.869
Who wanted that well-done chicken?

23:08.319 --> 23:10.779
This could be worth something.

23:12.359 --> 23:15.069
I could tell Mom about this.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.829
And I could duct-tape you
to a ceiling fan…

23:20.640 --> 23:22.990
I could tell Mom about this.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.829
And I could…

23:28.305 --> 23:34.400
