06:28.417 --> 06:30.667
without clean underwear before.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.000
You know, and I am sure

06:33.041 --> 06:34.875
Unique Excursions

06:33.041 --> 06:34.875
will take care of us.

06:34.917 --> 06:35.792
Am I right?

06:35.834 --> 06:37.208
Yeah, that's the spirit.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.709
Yeah, we're Harpers.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.625
And the Harpers don't let

06:38.750 --> 06:40.625
anything ruin their vacation.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.417
Yeah! Bring it in.

06:42.917 --> 06:46.291
[All]

06:42.917 --> 06:46.291
Whoa, Harpers!

06:46.333 --> 06:47.583
Whoa, it's the Harpers.

06:47.625 --> 06:48.750
[All]

06:47.625 --> 06:48.750
Robin!

06:48.792 --> 06:50.083
[Anne]

06:48.792 --> 06:50.083
We are so happy to see you.

06:50.834 --> 06:51.625
Me too.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.542
So here's the thing.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.834
You know how you need money

06:54.375 --> 06:56.834
to run a company?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.834
Well, apparently

06:56.875 --> 06:58.834
we don't have any,

06:58.875 --> 07:01.792
so I regret to inform you

06:58.875 --> 07:01.792
that your vacation is over.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.750
[all protesting in confusion]

07:03.792 --> 07:06.458
But all we got to see was

07:03.792 --> 07:06.458
the baggage carousel.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.750
[Robin]

07:06.500 --> 07:07.750
Well, that's fun.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.917
Anyhoo, on a completely

07:07.792 --> 07:09.917
unrelated note

07:09.959 --> 07:12.291
I have to go catch a flight

07:09.959 --> 07:12.291
to Mexico, so adios.

07:12.834 --> 07:15.500
[all speaking at once]

07:16.458 --> 07:18.375
Okay, a little hiccup,

07:16.458 --> 07:18.375
but hey,

07:18.417 --> 07:20.166
we're still in Hollywood, right?

07:18.417 --> 07:20.166
You know, we're already here,

07:20.208 --> 07:21.792
so we might as well

07:20.208 --> 07:21.792
make the best of it.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.000
You know what?

07:21.834 --> 07:23.000
You are right again, honey.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.709
Nothing is gonna

07:23.041 --> 07:24.709
stop this family

07:24.750 --> 07:26.375
from having a great vacation.

07:26.417 --> 07:28.375
All right, toss me my wallet,

07:26.417 --> 07:28.375
and let's get out of here.

07:28.417 --> 07:29.458
All right.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.500
Um, this isn't my bag.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.041
No problem.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.041
Is my wallet in that bag?

07:36.959 --> 07:37.750
It is not.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.000
Wait a minute.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.000
So we're in Hollywood

07:41.041 --> 07:43.125
with no clothes, no money,

07:41.041 --> 07:43.125
and nowhere to go?

07:51.083 --> 07:52.166
[Anne]

07:51.083 --> 07:52.166
I'll go talk to the airlines

07:52.208 --> 07:53.875
and see if maybe

07:52.208 --> 07:53.875
they can get us home.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.083
No, let's not give up yet.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.208
Wait a minute.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.542
The owner of this bag

07:57.250 --> 07:59.542
probably has Dawn's bag, right?

08:00.291 --> 08:01.959
Maybe there's something inside

08:00.291 --> 08:01.959
that'll tell us who they are,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.667
and we can get Dawn's bag back!

08:04.542 --> 08:05.417
Okay.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.375
Oh!

08:06.417 --> 08:07.041
Breath spray.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.041
Smoke pellets?

08:08.458 --> 08:09.208
A key.

08:09.792 --> 08:10.875
Clean underwear?

08:10.917 --> 08:12.500
Dibs!

08:12.542 --> 08:13.875
Ooh.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.083
"Do not pull."

08:16.083 --> 08:19.000
It says

08:16.083 --> 08:19.000
"Do not pull."

08:19.542 --> 08:20.625
Oh, here's

08:19.542 --> 08:20.625
something.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.875
It's a reservation for someone

08:21.458 --> 08:23.875
named Dave Olschewski

08:23.917 --> 08:25.291
for the Magic Castle

08:23.917 --> 08:25.291
today at noon.

08:25.750 --> 08:26.792
The Magic Castle.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.083
That's the premier showcase

08:28.125 --> 08:29.917
for top magicians

08:28.125 --> 08:29.917
from around the world!

08:30.792 --> 08:33.750
Maybe we should go there and see

08:30.792 --> 08:33.750
if he shows up with the bag?

08:35.417 --> 08:37.041
You know,

08:35.417 --> 08:37.041
just saying.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.959
Actually that's not

08:37.083 --> 08:38.959
a bad idea.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.208
Tom, what do you think?

08:40.250 --> 08:41.625
I think it's settled.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.792
To the Magic Castle!

08:47.083 --> 08:49.917
Oh, we've been

08:47.083 --> 08:49.917
walking for hours.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.291
So thirsty!

08:54.166 --> 08:56.083
Come on, Anne.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.083
We're almost there.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.041
I'm pushing

08:56.125 --> 08:58.041
just as hard as I can!

08:59.959 --> 09:02.959
Look, it's the Magic Castle!

09:03.417 --> 09:04.125
[Tom]

09:03.417 --> 09:04.125
Oh!

09:05.542 --> 09:06.291
Check it out.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.041
Someone's flying a drone.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.083
Hollywood has everything.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.625
Yeah, yeah.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.625
People are magical. Things fly.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.834
Now, let's find Olschewski

09:14.667 --> 09:16.834
and get my bag back.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.083
I saw that guy

09:18.917 --> 09:20.083
at the airport.

09:20.667 --> 09:21.625
[Ricky]

09:20.667 --> 09:21.625
He's got your bag.

09:21.667 --> 09:22.959
He bumped into me.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.333
That must have been

09:23.000 --> 09:24.333
when our bags got switched.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.291
[Nicky]

09:24.375 --> 09:25.291
Then he must be Olschewski.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.750
Let's go!

09:25.333 --> 09:26.750
Come on,

09:25.333 --> 09:26.750
go, go, go!

09:26.792 --> 09:27.709
[Tom]

09:26.792 --> 09:27.709
Oh, ow, wow.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.792
That's a big hill.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.792
Come on. Go.

09:28.834 --> 09:29.458
Whoo!

09:35.083 --> 09:37.041
Excuse me, where's the guy

09:35.083 --> 09:37.041
who just came in here?

09:37.667 --> 09:38.667
No one came in here.

09:38.709 --> 09:39.875
[Tom]

09:38.709 --> 09:39.875
Do you have any water?

09:39.917 --> 09:41.834
But that's impossible.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.834
We saw him walk in.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.542
Cold water, warm water,

09:41.875 --> 09:43.542
wet sponge?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.125
Sorry, sir, all the beverages

09:43.583 --> 09:47.125
and sponges are inside.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.458
Then we'd like to go

09:47.166 --> 09:48.458
inside, please.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.875
Yes, we would.

09:49.917 --> 09:52.125
I'm afraid nobody's allowed in

09:49.917 --> 09:52.125
without a reservation.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.959
Reservation.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.458
Dad, you have

09:55.000 --> 09:56.458
a reservation.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.417
Yes.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.291
I have a reservation?

09:58.792 --> 09:59.875
Ricky, get the reservation.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.709
Ha, the reservation.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.583
One reservation

10:01.750 --> 10:03.583
coming right up.

10:03.625 --> 10:04.792
Iugh.

10:04.834 --> 10:05.834
Whoops.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.291
The reservation.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.458
Mr. Olschewski.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.458
Welcome back.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.500
That's right.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.500
That's me.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.375
Mr. Olschewski.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.208
Yeah.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.291
Well, I'm sure you remember

10:18.333 --> 10:20.041
that there is

10:18.333 --> 10:20.041
a dress code for adults,

10:20.917 --> 10:23.458
but I see here

10:23.500 --> 10:26.083
that you left your jacket

10:23.500 --> 10:26.083
on your last visit.

10:32.875 --> 10:33.750
How did it fit

10:32.875 --> 10:33.750
in there?

10:33.792 --> 10:36.083
It's not even wrinkled.

10:36.583 --> 10:37.959
This is the Magic Castle.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.542
You may all go in.

10:41.083 --> 10:41.834
I'll check your bags.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.750
[Anne]

10:41.875 --> 10:42.750
Thank you.

10:43.667 --> 10:44.834
In where?

10:44.875 --> 10:46.458
Don't worry.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.458
I got this.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.333
Open sesame!

10:53.166 --> 10:56.917
Dude, you are way cooler

10:53.166 --> 10:56.917
in Hollywood.

10:58.417 --> 10:59.875
[Harpers]

10:58.417 --> 10:59.875
Wow!

11:00.667 --> 11:05.291
[playful music]

11:09.959 --> 11:12.000
This place is amazing.

11:12.041 --> 11:15.041
It is, but we have to find

11:12.041 --> 11:15.041
Olschewski and get my bag back.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.542
Maybe we should split up.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.083
Nicky, Dicky, go with Mom.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.083
I'll go with Ricky and Dad.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.166
Dad?

11:22.583 --> 11:24.417
They made him disappear.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.917
He's right there.

11:27.291 --> 11:27.959
- Keep 'em coming.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.750
Okay, good luck, honey.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.959
You too.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.959
Let's go, boys.

11:31.375 --> 11:32.834
[Tom]

11:31.375 --> 11:32.834
You wouldn't by any chance

11:31.375 --> 11:32.834
have any dental floss

11:32.875 --> 11:34.500
back there, would you?

11:32.875 --> 11:34.500
I got a thing in my teeth.

11:34.542 --> 11:35.792
There he is!

11:34.542 --> 11:35.792
Come on, Dad.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.542
- Oh, sorry. I'm cool.

11:40.208 --> 11:45.166
[suspenseful music]

11:48.375 --> 11:49.417
He went in there.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.417
Come on!

11:50.709 --> 11:51.917
[Tom]

11:50.709 --> 11:51.917
Go, go, go!

11:51.959 --> 11:53.208
And now for my next trick

11:53.625 --> 11:56.500
I shall make three people

11:53.625 --> 11:56.500
interrupt my show.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.917
[laughter]

11:59.375 --> 12:00.041
Whoops.

12:00.542 --> 12:01.750
The Great Billini!

12:01.792 --> 12:03.000
I've read all your books.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.625
And we're really sorry

12:03.041 --> 12:04.625
to interrupt,

12:04.667 --> 12:06.333
but we're looking for a man

12:04.667 --> 12:06.333
who just came in here.

12:06.375 --> 12:07.917
You know, kind of thin.

12:06.375 --> 12:07.917
Carrying a bag?

12:10.333 --> 12:11.041
Ta-da!

12:11.083 --> 12:14.000
[applause]

12:14.041 --> 12:15.041
No, not him.

12:16.291 --> 12:18.166
While we're here could you

12:16.291 --> 12:18.166
pull something out of my teeth?

12:19.417 --> 12:20.625
I just got a little

12:19.417 --> 12:20.625
something in there.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.959
Let me see what I can do.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.959
Just one second.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.834
[choking sounds]

12:23.834 --> 12:25.834
[coughing]

12:25.875 --> 12:28.166
[applause]

12:29.709 --> 12:30.750
No, that's not it,

12:29.709 --> 12:30.750
but could I?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.250
Yes.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.166
No, this man

12:33.125 --> 12:35.166
was wearing a--

12:35.208 --> 12:36.250
No, actually the only people

12:36.291 --> 12:38.542
to interrupt my show

12:36.291 --> 12:38.542
are you guys,

12:38.583 --> 12:41.500
which means that you get

12:38.583 --> 12:41.500
to help me in my next trick.

12:41.542 --> 12:42.875
You know, we really

12:41.542 --> 12:42.875
don't have any time to--

12:42.917 --> 12:43.959
We can spare a minute.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.291
Here we go.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.291
A regular deck of 98 cards.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.417
You know what we call this?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.417
Showing off.

12:48.458 --> 12:51.041
Ooh, hang on.

12:48.458 --> 12:51.041
Got it. Ha!

12:51.500 --> 12:53.417
No, actually I need you to take

12:51.500 --> 12:53.417
the cards and take out any--

12:53.458 --> 12:54.041
Wait, wait.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.542
[coughs]

12:55.583 --> 12:57.625
[laughter]

12:58.208 --> 12:59.959
Take out any card

12:58.208 --> 12:59.959
that you want.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.083
And then for you,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.083
I have this.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.834
This is a very

20:06.542 --> 20:07.709
We don't even use 'em.

20:07.750 --> 20:08.792
Don't even like

20:07.750 --> 20:08.792
to drive.

20:07.750 --> 20:08.792
Never.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.000
Wish I didn't

20:08.834 --> 20:10.000
have thumbs.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.333
Overrated.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.333
What is the point?

20:11.792 --> 20:13.375
I'm not here

20:11.792 --> 20:13.375
to play games, Olschewski.

20:13.417 --> 20:14.291
Dang it.

20:14.667 --> 20:15.667
Playing games

20:14.667 --> 20:15.667
was our last hope.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.458
There's got to be

20:16.250 --> 20:18.458
some way out of this.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.333
Ricky?

20:20.375 --> 20:21.709
Oh, sure.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.291
When it involves a puppet show

20:21.750 --> 20:23.291
or getting the stain

20:23.333 --> 20:25.375
out of a jersey you've

20:23.333 --> 20:25.375
got all the answers.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.792
I know what to do.

20:28.834 --> 20:31.417
It's time to bring

20:28.834 --> 20:31.417
a little punch to this party.

20:31.875 --> 20:32.542
Dicky, no.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.083
Dicky, yes.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.834
All I need are the smoke pellets

20:35.125 --> 20:37.834
from Olschewski's bag.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.291
Dicky, don't do

20:39.000 --> 20:40.291
anything stupid.

20:40.709 --> 20:44.041
Stupid is my middle name.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.166
[Dawn]

20:44.083 --> 20:46.166
Don't you dare.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.166
Don't you dare. I swear!

20:50.208 --> 20:52.083
[Tom]

20:50.208 --> 20:52.083
Listen, Gayle, tell you what.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.166
You let us go...

20:55.083 --> 20:57.500
the second we get

20:55.083 --> 20:57.500
back to Boulder,

20:57.542 --> 20:59.250
12 pack of tube socks

20:57.542 --> 20:59.250
coming your way.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.083
And that is

20:59.875 --> 21:02.083
just the beginning.

21:02.542 --> 21:03.917
Honey, don't--

21:03.959 --> 21:05.750
Let the man respond

21:03.959 --> 21:05.750
to the offer.

21:05.792 --> 21:06.667
[Anne]

21:05.792 --> 21:06.667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.542
Raccoon!

21:11.709 --> 21:12.500
Hey, tough guys,

21:14.291 --> 21:16.667
today's forecast is

21:14.291 --> 21:16.667
cloudy with a chance...

21:17.417 --> 21:19.166
of pain.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.208
[grunts]

21:26.709 --> 21:28.083
What?

21:28.125 --> 21:28.834
[Goon]

21:28.125 --> 21:28.834
Oh!

21:31.500 --> 21:34.417
Oh!

21:34.458 --> 21:36.125
Hey, Olschewski,

21:34.458 --> 21:36.125
control your kid.

21:36.542 --> 21:37.792
Do you have kids,

21:36.542 --> 21:37.792
Gayle?

21:41.041 --> 21:44.625
Looks like we should

21:41.041 --> 21:44.625
call this a tie.

21:45.625 --> 21:46.458
[Gayle]

21:45.625 --> 21:46.458
What the--

21:45.625 --> 21:46.458
Waht the--

21:47.166 --> 21:48.667
Run! Go, go!

21:49.458 --> 21:50.959
[Tom]

21:49.458 --> 21:50.959
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:52.083 --> 21:53.000
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:57.834 --> 21:59.208
My job must be done here,

21:59.250 --> 22:01.792
because it's time to...

21:59.250 --> 22:01.792
punch out!

22:02.458 --> 22:03.083
[Dawn]

22:02.458 --> 22:03.083
Come on!

22:03.125 --> 22:04.333
Oh.

22:04.375 --> 22:05.291
Ah!

22:05.333 --> 22:07.041
[tires screech]

22:10.291 --> 22:13.208
That. Was. Awesome!

22:15.375 --> 22:17.375
- Woah.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.375
- I was so scared.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.375
- [Dicky]

22:15.375 --> 22:17.375
That was close.

22:17.417 --> 22:18.417
[Nicky]

22:17.417 --> 22:18.417
Who were those people?

22:18.458 --> 22:19.250
[Ricky]

22:18.458 --> 22:19.250
What's going on?

22:20.208 --> 22:21.542
[Tom]

22:20.208 --> 22:21.542
Okay. I think we lost 'em.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.125
Let's just call the police.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.875
[cell phone rings]

22:23.166 --> 22:24.875
It's Gayle's phone.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.000
Not it!

22:27.041 --> 22:27.875
[Ricky]

22:27.041 --> 22:27.875
Don't give it to me!

22:27.917 --> 22:28.709
I don't want it.

22:28.750 --> 22:29.625
Hey, I don't want it either.

22:29.667 --> 22:30.750
[Nicky]

22:29.667 --> 22:30.750
No, no. Seriously?

22:31.834 --> 22:33.041
<i>[Man]</i>

22:31.834 --> 22:33.041
<i>Hello?</i>

22:33.083 --> 22:33.750
Should I answer?

22:34.959 --> 22:36.709
<i>[Man]</i>

22:34.959 --> 22:36.709
<i>Yes, this is the CIA.</i>

22:37.417 --> 22:38.917
How can they hear me?

22:38.959 --> 22:40.500
<i>[Man]</i>

22:38.959 --> 22:40.500
<i>You're whispering very loudly,</i>

22:40.875 --> 22:43.208
<i>We need to get</i>

22:40.875 --> 22:43.208
<i>your family to safety.</i>

22:43.250 --> 22:44.917
How did you know

22:43.250 --> 22:44.917
we had this phone?

22:44.959 --> 22:48.125
<i>[Man]</i>

22:44.959 --> 22:48.125
<i>Ma'am, we're the CIA.</i>

22:44.959 --> 22:48.125
<i>Now you can't go to the police.</i>

22:48.166 --> 22:49.583
<i>They've been infiltrated</i>

22:48.166 --> 22:49.583
<i>by Gayle's men.</i>

22:49.625 --> 22:52.083
Wait, what is going on?

22:49.625 --> 22:52.083
Who is Gayle?

22:52.125 --> 22:53.959
Yeah. Who's Olschewski?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.375
<i>[Man]</i>

22:54.000 --> 22:55.375

[dial tone]

23:06.709 --> 23:07.458
[beeps]

23:08.208 --> 23:09.625
Wow. We finally caught

23:08.208 --> 23:09.625
a break, huh?

23:09.667 --> 23:10.667
[Ricky and Dicky]

23:09.667 --> 23:10.667
Yes.

23:10.709 --> 23:12.250
Drive fast, Tom.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.166
[tires screech]

23:13.208 --> 23:15.875
[hurried, tense music]

23:15.917 --> 23:19.500
[GPS Woman]

23:15.917 --> 23:19.500
Turn left on North

23:15.917 --> 23:19.500
Windsor Boulevard.

23:22.083 --> 23:24.417
You have reached

23:22.083 --> 23:24.417
your destination.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.959
[All]

23:26.000 --> 23:27.959
Whoa.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.417
[Anne]

23:28.000 --> 23:30.417
Paramount Pictures?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.417
This is so exciting!

23:33.250 --> 23:34.458
[laughing]

23:35.125 --> 23:36.125
Okay.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.583
Gate's not opening.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Why isn't the gate opening?

23:42.625 --> 23:44.083
Okay. All right, all right,

23:42.625 --> 23:44.083
all right.

23:44.834 --> 23:45.667
Here's the plan.

23:51.083 --> 23:51.709
Run for it!

23:51.750 --> 23:52.834
Dad, wait!

23:53.333 --> 23:55.709
I've got some

23:53.333 --> 23:55.709
Hollywood magic of my own.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.709
Watch and learn, boys.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.709
Mom, glasses.

23:57.750 --> 23:58.750
Oh.

23:59.291 --> 24:00.208
Be right with you.

24:00.792 --> 24:01.792
Hi.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.750
Yoo-hoo,

24:02.250 --> 24:04.750
my fellow Hollywooder.

24:04.792 --> 24:07.208
Yes, it's me, Dawn Harper,

24:04.792 --> 24:07.208
the famous movie actor.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.875
[giggles]

24:07.625 --> 24:09.875
Please, no autographs.

24:09.917 --> 24:14.667
Anyway, I'm here for a very

24:09.917 --> 24:14.667
important meeting with Steve...

24:16.166 --> 24:17.375
Paramount,

24:17.417 --> 24:18.834
so if you would just be a doll

24:18.875 --> 24:20.208
and open the gate

24:18.875 --> 24:20.208
that'd be divine.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.792
[giggles]

24:22.125 --> 24:23.291
"Divine?"

24:22.125 --> 24:23.291
Seriously?

24:23.333 --> 24:24.417
We're doomed.

24:26.542 --> 24:27.250
Oh!

24:27.291 --> 24:28.542
Much obliged.

24:29.834 --> 24:30.500
[Anne]

24:29.834 --> 24:30.500
We're in.

24:30.542 --> 24:31.792
[Ricky]

24:30.542 --> 24:31.792
We're saved!

24:31.834 --> 24:33.208
[Dicky]

24:31.834 --> 24:33.208
Yeah, but what are we

24:31.834 --> 24:33.208
supposed to do

24:33.250 --> 24:34.625
while Dawn's here in a meeting

24:33.250 --> 24:34.625
with Steve Paramount?

24:35.333 --> 24:37.166
[all groan]

24:41.542 --> 24:42.917
[Tom]

24:41.542 --> 24:42.917
Where is this guy?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.250
His text said to meet him

24:42.959 --> 24:45.250
right at this bench.

24:48.291 --> 24:49.750
Oh, my gosh.

24:48.291 --> 24:49.750
That's Jack Griffo.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.000
[Nicky]

24:51.250 --> 24:53.000
He's walking this way!

24:53.041 --> 24:54.208
[Dicky]

24:53.041 --> 24:54.208
He's getting closer.

24:54.250 --> 24:55.667
He's sitting down.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.583
I'm talking right to him.

24:58.667 --> 24:59.417
Hi.

24:59.709 --> 25:00.583
[all gasp]

25:00.959 --> 25:01.959
No need to gasp.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.208
[gasps]

25:02.000 --> 25:04.208
You're the guy on the phone.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.041
You're our contact?

25:05.625 --> 25:08.333
But you're Max Thunderman.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.291
I mean, you know,

25:09.500 --> 25:11.291
the kids watch the show.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.917
We love it.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.917
We do.

25:13.291 --> 25:14.417
That's just my cover.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.333
In real life,

25:15.500 --> 25:17.333
I work for the CIA.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.333
I'm here to help,

25:17.750 --> 25:19.333
all right?

25:19.375 --> 25:20.834
So just hand me

25:19.375 --> 25:20.834
over the thumb drive,

25:20.875 --> 25:22.041
and I'll take care

25:20.875 --> 25:22.041
of everything else.

25:22.709 --> 25:23.875
We don't have

25:22.709 --> 25:23.875
the thumb drive.

25:24.709 --> 25:26.083
[chuckles]

25:26.125 --> 25:27.458
Look, Harpers, I don't know

25:26.125 --> 25:27.458
who you're working for,

25:27.500 --> 25:29.208
but I want that drive.

25:29.250 --> 25:30.625
We don't work

25:29.250 --> 25:30.625
for anybody.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.750
[Anne]

25:30.667 --> 25:32.750
We own a sporting goods shop.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.750
Oh, can we interest you

25:32.792 --> 25:34.750
in some half-off tube socks?

25:36.166 --> 25:37.792
Ex-nay on the tube socks-ay.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.333
Give me the drive, old man.

25:40.375 --> 25:41.208
Aah.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.041
Guys, I don't think he

25:41.834 --> 25:44.041
really works for the CIA.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.917
I'm gonna give you

25:44.500 --> 25:45.917
three seconds.

25:46.667 --> 25:47.667
Things are gonna get ugly,

25:49.291 --> 25:51.625
and with this face

25:49.291 --> 25:51.625
it's not easy.

25:54.125 --> 25:55.125
Three, two--

25:55.166 --> 25:56.375
He's counting.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.333
Wait. I have it right here.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.959
Are you sure you really want it?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.542
Yes. Give it to me.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.875
All right.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.875
One thumb drive coming right up!

26:05.917 --> 26:07.000
Ahh!

26:07.041 --> 26:08.125
[Dawn]

26:07.041 --> 26:08.125
Run!

26:08.166 --> 26:09.750
[Tom]

26:08.166 --> 26:09.750
You just blinded

26:08.166 --> 26:09.750
Max Thunderman!

26:10.667 --> 26:12.166
[Anne]

26:10.667 --> 26:12.166
Dawn, I can't believe

26:10.667 --> 26:12.166
you did that!

26:12.208 --> 26:12.834
Nice work!
