01:38.473 --> 01:44.151
<i>Here I go
Going down, down, down</i>

01:44.313 --> 01:47.066
<i>My mind is a blank</i>

01:47.649 --> 01:52.826
<i>My head is spinning
Around and around</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:59.246
<i>As I go deep into
the funnel of love</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:08.170
<i>It's such a crazy, crazy feeling</i>

02:08.336 --> 02:10.931
<i>I get weak in the knees</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:16.354
<i>My poor old head is a reelin'</i>

02:17.137 --> 02:23.315
<i>As I go deep into
the funnel of love</i>

02:26.688 --> 02:32.536
<i>I tried and I tried,
to run and hide</i>

02:33.111 --> 02:38.789
<i>I even tried to run away</i>

02:39.201 --> 02:44.799
<i>Ya just can't run
From the funnel of love</i>

02:45.707 --> 02:50.884
<i>It's bound to get ya someday</i>

02:54.049 --> 03:01.775
<i>Deep into the funnel of love</i>

03:03.225 --> 03:09.153
<i>Deep into the funnel of love</i>

04:06.163 --> 04:07.756
Ian.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.209
- Adam, man, how are you?
- Hey.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.919
- Is this the Supro?
- Yeah.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.800
It's a beautiful one, man.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.678
I hope you're gonna like
it because these Supros,

04:16.882 --> 04:20.011
they're getting harder and
harder to find, you know?

04:20.218 --> 04:22.687
You get one, but the
pickups are messed up.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.607
You get one, the neck is
messed up or something.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.309
Oh, Shit.

04:27.517 --> 04:31.488
Adam, you want me to take off my
shoes? I think I stepped in some mud.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.988
- Ian, I really wouldn't bother.
- All right.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.699
The Supro.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.877
1959, man.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.633
- Really nice, Ian. Thank you.
- Cool.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.467
All the electronics, everything,
are original, of course.

04:59.674 --> 05:04.521
- I plugged them in, made sure they work.
- Just what the doctor ordered,

05:04.721 --> 05:06.689
as they say.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.774
I shall call him William Lawes.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.699
It's a male?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.527
This one is, yeah.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.621
Who's William Lawes?

05:21.822 --> 05:25.201
Oh, just some old
17th-century English guy.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.125
Wrote some great funeral music.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.167
Then, during the English Civil War,

05:33.667 --> 05:37.422
he was casually shot dead
by a Parliamentarian.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.430
Oh.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.096
That sucks.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.936
Adam, check this one out, man.

05:51.184 --> 05:56.111
- This one...
- Is a very strange Hagstrom from 1960.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.316
- Swedish.
- Yeah.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.028
- Look at this thing.
- Heh, heh.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.411
Look at the back.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.496
- Mother of toilet seat.
- Heh, heh.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.003
Seriously, man.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.842
Wow.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.217
And this one...

06:20.463 --> 06:22.557
Check this out.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.513
It's a Silvertone.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.470
From the very early '60s.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.773
With an amp built into
the case. Fantastic.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.065
Right?

06:31.266 --> 06:32.859
Yeah.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.811
And...

06:37.314 --> 06:41.820
Oh, that's a lovely
Gretsch Chet Atkins.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.246
Mm-hm.

06:45.864 --> 06:49.994
6120, Double Cutaway.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.248
Heh.

06:55.457 --> 06:59.132
I once saw Eddie Cochran
play one of these.

06:59.461 --> 07:03.591
Though he had the front pickup
modified to a Gibson P-90.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.854
Wait. You actually saw
Eddie Cochran play?

07:10.138 --> 07:12.186
Yeah, on YouTube.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.021
Oh, right.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.351
Of course, man.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.398
Hey, you.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.774
- I have something special for you.
- Hey. We have what you need.

08:06.611 --> 08:11.242
I know you don't wanna play live,
I know you wanna remain anonymous,

08:11.449 --> 08:14.373
but you being so reclusive
and everything...

08:15.370 --> 08:19.671
is probably only gonna make people
more interested in your music.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.502
Yeah.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.050
What a drag.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.807
Listen, Ian. There is
something you can do for me.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.565
Anything. Yeah,
anything. What is it?

08:39.769 --> 08:41.736
I need a bullet.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.111
A very special bullet.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.615
Really? I got you that box of
shells with the .38 last year.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.617
I know, the .38.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.871
I need a .38-caliber
bullet but made of wood.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.586
A wooden bullet? Seriously, man?

08:56.786 --> 09:00.165
And made from the hardest and
most dense wood you can find.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.918
I'd suggest ironwood, lignum vitae.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.345
Maybe snakewood,
<i>Piratinera guianensis.</i>

09:05.545 --> 09:09.470
Or possibly African blackwood,
<i>Dalbergia melanoxylon.</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:11.642
Find someone who can
make it for me?

09:12.093 --> 09:13.720
Yeah, but could you just...?

09:13.928 --> 09:16.397
Could you repeat the last couple?

09:16.598 --> 09:20.148
Ironwood, lignum vitae.
Snakewood, <i>Piratinera guianensis</i>

09:20.351 --> 09:23.696
or blackwood, <i>Dalbergia
melanoxylon.</i>

09:23.897 --> 09:26.116
<i>Dalbergia...</i>

09:27.233 --> 09:28.951
Okay.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.578
Yeah, I mean, I think I know
someone, but what the hell for?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.918
It's for a...

09:37.285 --> 09:39.128
A project.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.082
A secret art project.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.793
Okay, cool, cool.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.254
All right, let me think. Um...

09:50.381 --> 09:52.304
Thank you, Adam.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.230
The shell casing should be brass,
but the bullet has to be wood.

09:57.639 --> 10:01.269
- You just want one?
- Just the one, yeah.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.064
Okay, cool.

10:07.565 --> 10:12.162
Uh, anything else weird or
interesting you might need?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.740
There's a warehouse sale.

10:14.948 --> 10:20.296
This guy's selling all these Sovtek amps,
germanium resistors, Soviet tubes.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.839
I thought I might check
it out, see if you...

10:23.039 --> 10:26.168
No, I'm good. Thank you.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.340
Okay.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.552
Can I use your bathroom
before I head out?

10:31.756 --> 10:35.101
Uh, I'm afraid it's
still out of order.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.974
Still? I'm gonna get someone...

10:37.178 --> 10:39.146
- Don't bother.
- It's really no bother.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.020
No!

10:44.352 --> 10:45.820
Look, Ian, I, uh...

10:46.020 --> 10:50.571
I'm gonna fix it myself. I just
haven't gotten around to it yet.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.826
Please, feel free to
piss in the garden.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.071
Bilal.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.592
So...

12:35.463 --> 12:38.091
Tell me, how is he, really?

12:38.299 --> 12:40.927
My teacher is fragile,

12:41.135 --> 12:44.105
but he has a strong spirit.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.605
He's in such good hands.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.774
He's my family.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.114
And I protect...

12:53.982 --> 12:56.701
Protect his secrets.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.581
And yours too.

14:49.222 --> 14:53.022
Actually, hospital management
no longer considers it overtime.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.024
Yes.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.426
Mistress mine.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.474
There's only an hour
before sunrise.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.272
I'm well aware of that, my dear.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.271
Is that the really good stuff?

15:34.475 --> 15:35.818
Yes, Eve.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.941
From the French doctor?

15:38.688 --> 15:39.985
Precisely.

15:41.107 --> 15:45.533
So how is the fabulous
Christopher Marlowe tonight?

15:45.736 --> 15:49.866
I told you a thousand times,
never call me that name in public.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.496
Oh.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.712
You nutcase.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.332
I can keep a secret.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.258
You should know that.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.631
But I ask you,

16:00.835 --> 16:05.716
the most outrageously delicious
literary scandal in history...

16:05.923 --> 16:09.393
Dear Eve, that was
four centuries ago.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.347
You've been wearing that
weskit for four centuries.

16:12.555 --> 16:17.311
I was given this in 1586, and
it's one of my favorite garments.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.440
Are you saying that we're never
gonna let the cat out of the bag?

16:23.941 --> 16:28.037
Can't we drop the odd
hint here and there?

16:28.613 --> 16:32.243
It would cause such
thrilling chaos.

16:32.658 --> 16:37.209
I think the world has enough chaos

16:37.538 --> 16:40.212
to keep it going for the minute.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.760
You spoilsport.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.722
Hm.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.295
I see you...

17:46.691 --> 17:49.114
I see you.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.784
Jesus Christ.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.169
You scared the shit out of me.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.586
I've sort of been
expecting you recently

18:05.793 --> 18:09.218
for some reason, uh, doctor...

18:09.422 --> 18:11.800
Uh, Dr. Faust.

18:12.008 --> 18:16.354
It's good to see you
again too, Dr. Watson.

18:31.235 --> 18:37.789
You know, uh, this whole setup
is a bit unnerving for me.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.912
Wouldn't you consider meeting

18:41.120 --> 18:43.623
somewhere outside the
hospital sometime

18:44.415 --> 18:47.840
instead of just
appearing unexpectedly

18:48.044 --> 18:51.514
like a phantom?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.012
That would require prearrangement.

18:54.216 --> 18:58.892
Yeah, and it would be safer for me.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.224
I like to come to the source.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.606
Besides, the mutual jeopardy
makes me feel safer.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.312
If you'll excuse me.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.649
I don't have any spare time.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.983
Right.

19:11.192 --> 19:16.164
Well, then, let me get
you what you desire,

19:16.364 --> 19:20.790
uh, Dr. Strangelove.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.763
Type O <i>negativo.</i>

19:46.560 --> 19:48.028
Mm-hm.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.449
By the way, that stethoscope

19:55.653 --> 19:58.247
of yours

19:58.447 --> 20:00.791
is for all practical
purposes, an antique.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.085
It's from the 1970s.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.208
Maybe even the '60s.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.585
Is it?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.705
Cat gotta be from Cleveland.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.698
Yeah.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.283
Adam.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.119
Eve.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.370
<i>Hey, darling.</i>

24:53.784 --> 24:55.832
- I wanna see you.
<i>- I wanna see you too.</i>

25:01.709 --> 25:05.054
<i>What is that? That you scrabbling
about with all your wires</i>

25:05.254 --> 25:09.851
<i>- and knobs, my little pack rat?</i>
- Yeah, one second. I just...

25:10.050 --> 25:11.142
I just...

25:14.555 --> 25:15.727
<i>Hello.</i>

25:15.931 --> 25:17.774
There you are.

25:17.975 --> 25:20.228
<i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

25:21.854 --> 25:24.482
<i>- What is it? You look tired.</i>
- Do I?

25:26.859 --> 25:30.329
- Hm.
<i>- I guess I am, a little, yeah.</i>

25:30.946 --> 25:33.244
<i>Any supply problems?</i>

25:33.449 --> 25:34.951
No.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.246
<i>So, what is this, then?</i>

25:50.841 --> 25:54.266
<i>Can you tell your wife
what your problem is?</i>

25:57.723 --> 25:59.691
<i>It's these zombies</i>

25:59.892 --> 26:02.315
and the way they treat the world.

26:05.189 --> 26:08.693
I just feel like all the sand's
at the bottom of the hourglass,

26:08.901 --> 26:09.948
or something.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.575
<i>Time to turn it over, then.</i>

26:13.489 --> 26:16.618
<i>Oh, my liege lord.</i>

26:16.825 --> 26:19.169
<i>We've been here before.</i>

26:19.369 --> 26:20.666
<i>Remember?</i>

26:20.871 --> 26:24.671
<i>You missed all the real fun, like
the Middle Ages, the Tartars,</i>

26:24.875 --> 26:26.548
<i>the Inquisitions.</i>

26:26.752 --> 26:29.221
The floods, the plagues.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.441
<i>Well, how about your music?</i>

26:40.641 --> 26:42.143
I seem to be...

26:43.977 --> 26:46.856
<i>Writing a lot of
funeral music. Heh.</i>

26:47.606 --> 26:51.656
<i>Oh, my darling. Why don't you
just come here and kiss me?</i>

26:52.194 --> 26:54.572
<i>You used to love Tangier.</i>

26:54.780 --> 26:56.748
<i>You loved the music.</i>

27:02.538 --> 27:04.540
Oh, fuck.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.505
All right.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.135
I'll come.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.514
But I can't believe you're
doing this to me again.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.846
It's just the traveling

27:19.054 --> 27:20.556
<i>that's such a drag.</i>

27:22.349 --> 27:23.441
Eve...

27:25.227 --> 27:27.195
<i>I love you so much.</i>

27:28.021 --> 27:31.116
<i>I'll take that for the journey.</i>

29:30.894 --> 29:31.941
Fucking hell.

31:01.485 --> 31:06.662
Yes. And is there a possibility of a
night flight from Tangier to Paris?

31:07.240 --> 31:08.537
Yes, that would work.

31:08.742 --> 31:13.168
And then flying the following night
from Paris to Detroit, is that correct?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.669
Wonderful.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.875
Name of Fibonacci.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.411
- Hey, I hope this isn't a bad time.
- Hm.

33:11.615 --> 33:15.791
I wanted to come right away
because I have that thing for you.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.674
Wooden bullet, .38 caliber.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.763
It's cocobolo.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.851
<i>Dalbergia retusa.</i>

33:32.385 --> 33:34.228
For your art project.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.395
Guy made it for me,
no questions asked.

33:37.599 --> 33:41.399
He said the wood was so dense
that it sinks in water.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.573
And I think they make
guitars out of it too.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.238
Both are true, yeah.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.403
It's perfect.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.828
Thank you, Ian.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.952
No problem, man.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.917
You know, for a zombie,

33:56.243 --> 33:57.290
you're all right.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.711
Thanks.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.169
Please.

34:09.589 --> 34:13.014
Oh, no, man. You already paid
me so much the other time.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.391
- It's okay.
- Ian, please.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.937
You bought my car and everything.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.773
Thank you, Adam.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.690
Uh...

34:27.690 --> 34:31.411
Anything else you might need, man?
Anything you want me to get you?

34:31.987 --> 34:36.208
There were some rock 'n' roll kids
here last night, ringing my doorbell.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.909
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:38.118 --> 34:42.168
How do they know where you live?
No one fucking lives out here.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.299
I don't know, but it's not cool.
We talked about this.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.252
I know. I know we did, man.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.964
It's not cool at all. It's completely
fucked up. How would they...?

34:51.880 --> 34:54.350
All right, I know. Don't worry.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.179
I'm gonna spread some
rumors, very cautiously,

34:57.387 --> 35:00.857
about where you might live and
just throw them way off track.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.520
Whatever you need to
do, please do it.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.072
Just take care of it.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.240
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.739
Look, I'll see you later.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.788
I've got something I need to do.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.000
You know...

35:28.627 --> 35:31.050
I had a dream...

35:32.672 --> 35:36.267
about your infamous
little sister last night.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.513
You had a dream about Ava?

35:39.721 --> 35:42.065
What sort of a dream, Kit?

35:43.642 --> 35:45.144
Kit?

35:46.811 --> 35:48.063
What?

35:48.271 --> 35:50.365
Oh, sorry. I...

35:51.274 --> 35:53.823
- Sorry. I drifted away for a minute.
- Heh, heh.

35:54.027 --> 35:57.531
- You were miles away.
- Heh, heh.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.791
- Italy, actually.
- Ha, ha, ha.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.415
Few hundred years ago.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.707
Was he painfully good-looking?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.551
- What?
- Ha, ha, ha.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.049
Uh...

36:12.462 --> 36:15.841
Look, I know I don't
have to say this to you,

36:16.716 --> 36:19.185
but please be cautious.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.730
I couldn't bear it if...

36:22.972 --> 36:25.976
I couldn't bear it if
something happened to you.

36:28.144 --> 36:32.240
Frankly, I don't understand why
you don't live in the same place

36:32.440 --> 36:35.410
because you can't live
without each other.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.331
Anyway, give my regards to that

36:41.116 --> 36:45.587
suicidally romantic scoundrel.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.710
Do you really think he is?

36:47.914 --> 36:51.464
Scoundrel? Heh, heh. Yes.

36:53.336 --> 36:56.306
Well, let's hope
he's just romantic.

36:57.257 --> 37:01.353
Even so, I mainly blame
Shelley and Byron

37:01.553 --> 37:05.353
and some of those French assholes
he used to hang around with.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.983
Oh, I wish that I had met
him before I wrote <i>Hamlet.</i>

37:10.895 --> 37:16.322
He would have provided the most
perfect role model imaginable.

38:09.621 --> 38:13.546
<i>Love alters not, with his
brief hours and weeks</i>

38:13.750 --> 38:17.345
<i>But bears it out even
to the edge of doom</i>

38:17.545 --> 38:20.674
<i>If this be error and upon me proved</i>

38:20.882 --> 38:25.262
<i>I never writ, nor no man ever loved</i>

38:30.350 --> 38:32.068
Marlowe.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.277
Ow. Shit.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.358
Oh, man.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.115
I'm a mess.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.701
Excuse me.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.955
Oh, la, la. Let me get
you something for that.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.963
Thank you.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.812
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning
our descent into Detroit Metro Airport.</i>

39:15.019 --> 39:17.898
<i>We thank you for flying
with us on Air Lumiere</i>

39:18.106 --> 39:20.529
<i>and hope to see you again soon.</i>

40:15.455 --> 40:17.924
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.885
Oh.

40:29.594 --> 40:32.347
<i>Mephitis mephitis.</i>

41:40.999 --> 41:42.717
My lady.

41:53.803 --> 41:55.430
May I?

42:42.810 --> 42:45.905
I love what you've
done with the place.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.453
I love your newest music too.

42:53.029 --> 42:56.624
It made me think of when you gave that
string quintet to Schubert. Remember?

42:56.824 --> 43:00.419
- Hm.
- And he presented it as his own.

43:00.620 --> 43:03.123
Yeah, but I asked him to do that.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.635
And I only gave him the adagio.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.798
Just to put something out there.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.725
Is that why you released
this new stuff?

43:15.885 --> 43:17.558
I needed a reflection.

43:19.347 --> 43:23.602
To see if it would
echo back before...

43:23.935 --> 43:25.778
Before what?

43:28.356 --> 43:30.484
Oh, Adam.

43:32.902 --> 43:37.658
You always have the convenience of the
zombies to blame when you get low.

43:38.825 --> 43:40.668
What about all your heroes?

43:40.868 --> 43:41.915
I don't have heroes.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.622
No?

43:43.830 --> 43:46.299
What about your blessed scientists?

43:46.499 --> 43:48.422
The scientists?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.879
Well, look at what
they've done to them.

43:51.087 --> 43:53.636
Pythagoras, slaughtered.

43:54.090 --> 43:55.683
Galileo, imprisoned.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.726
Copernicus, ridiculed.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.680
Poor old Newton, pushed
into secrecy and alchemy.

44:00.888 --> 44:03.232
Tesla, destroyed.

44:03.432 --> 44:08.029
His beautiful possibilities
completely ignored.

44:08.646 --> 44:11.365
And they're still bitching
about Darwin, still.

44:13.276 --> 44:15.404
So much for the scientists.

44:18.364 --> 44:21.914
And now they have
succeeded in contaminating

44:22.118 --> 44:25.042
their own fucking blood,
never mind their water.

44:25.580 --> 44:29.301
Yeah, well, if we're
gonna have a litany

44:29.500 --> 44:32.174
of all the zombie
atrocities of history,

44:32.378 --> 44:34.972
we'll be here till
the sun comes up.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.724
The sun is coming up.

44:46.309 --> 44:49.404
Shall I tell you again about
spooky action at a distance?

44:50.354 --> 44:52.197
Einstein's theory of entanglement.

44:53.900 --> 44:57.871
Yeah. I love the way you tell it.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.414
But not now.

45:00.615 --> 45:03.289
We don't wanna be up all day.

45:04.702 --> 45:05.749
Eve?

45:06.162 --> 45:07.334
Hm?

45:08.915 --> 45:12.920
Can you tell me how
old this guitar is?

45:13.502 --> 45:14.845
I think it's an L2

45:15.046 --> 45:18.801
but I've never been able
to date it exactly.

45:23.346 --> 45:24.768
Aw.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.984
She's a pretty one.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.394
A Gibson.

45:31.604 --> 45:33.652
1905.

45:34.315 --> 45:35.862
She is old.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.911
Yes, my darling, but you
know your dressing gown

45:39.111 --> 45:42.957
- is at least a century older.
- Is it?

45:43.157 --> 45:44.500
Yeah.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.134
So this is your wilderness.

46:44.093 --> 46:46.061
Detroit.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.978
Everybody left.

46:53.894 --> 46:56.898
- What's that?
- It's the Packard plant

46:57.106 --> 47:00.701
where they once built the most
beautiful cars in the world.

47:02.278 --> 47:03.996
Finished.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.707
But this place will rise again.

47:06.907 --> 47:09.831
- Will it?
- Yeah.

47:10.036 --> 47:11.834
There's water here.

47:13.414 --> 47:16.759
And when the cities in
the South are burning,

47:18.711 --> 47:21.510
this place will bloom.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.407
Do you wanna see the Motown Museum?

47:43.611 --> 47:46.615
Although it's not much to
look at from the outside.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.909
I'm more of a Stax girl myself.

47:52.828 --> 47:56.708
Actually, there is something
I could show you.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.798
It's not far.

48:05.508 --> 48:06.930
There.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.808
That's Jack White's house.

48:10.012 --> 48:13.186
Oh. I love Jack White.

48:13.516 --> 48:16.315
- That's where he grew up.
- Oh.

48:16.644 --> 48:18.612
Little Jack White.

48:19.230 --> 48:20.982
Nice.

48:25.403 --> 48:28.577
Do you know he's actually
his mother's seventh son?

48:30.241 --> 48:32.209
That figures.

48:37.581 --> 48:40.881
And this is the famous
Michigan Theater.

48:41.794 --> 48:44.422
They built it back in the 1920s.

48:44.630 --> 48:46.974
A huge sum of money.

48:47.425 --> 48:50.304
It's built, ironically,
on the exact same site

48:50.511 --> 48:54.391
as Henry Ford made his
very first prototype.

48:57.226 --> 49:00.901
They used to be able to seat
over 4000 people in here.

49:01.105 --> 49:02.903
It's fantastic.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.235
For what? For concerts?

49:05.443 --> 49:07.696
Concerts and as a movie house.

49:07.903 --> 49:09.701
Can you imagine?

49:11.115 --> 49:14.335
Mirrors used to reflect
the chandeliers.

49:16.996 --> 49:20.876
And now a car park.

49:38.851 --> 49:41.445
There goes your queen, playboy.

49:45.232 --> 49:49.032
By the way, your hero, Christopher
Marlowe, sends his love.

49:49.236 --> 49:51.409
I don't have heroes.

49:51.906 --> 49:54.659
And I know what you're doing.
Trying to distract me.

49:54.867 --> 49:57.290
Now, no more talking.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.208
- Did you play chess with Byron?
- Eve, please.

50:02.416 --> 50:03.884
No, I want to know.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.338
You love telling me these
things and I love to hear them.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.181
So, what was he like?

50:09.381 --> 50:13.261
- Frankly, he was a pompous ass.
- Ha, ha, ha.

50:13.636 --> 50:16.560
Why am I not surprised?

50:18.474 --> 50:19.691
And what about Mary?

50:19.892 --> 50:22.771
What was Mary Wollstonecraft like?

50:23.646 --> 50:27.241
Come on, tell me.
What was she like?

50:27.942 --> 50:30.570
- She was delicious.
- Heh, heh.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.698
I'll bet she was.

50:34.573 --> 50:37.292
Talking of delicious,
I have a surprise.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.245
An experiment.

50:39.662 --> 50:42.916
- That doesn't work, by the way.
- No, it does. I plugged it in.

50:51.507 --> 50:54.807
- What is that?
- O-negative.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.601
That's delicious.

50:59.598 --> 51:01.020
Blood on a stick.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.977
On a stick.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.277
- That's not bad.
- Very refreshing,

51:07.481 --> 51:11.236
especially when
you're in a hot spot.

51:12.987 --> 51:15.911
Checkmate, my darling.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.080
Eve, you're ruthless.

51:18.284 --> 51:19.957
You're brutal.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.504
I'm a survivor, baby.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.292
It was all the bloody talking.

51:32.798 --> 51:34.892
You got to hear this one.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.307
It's Charlie Feathers.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.441
Do you know it?

51:50.941 --> 51:53.569
1956.

51:53.986 --> 51:55.488
"Can't Hardly Stand it."

51:56.947 --> 51:58.039
Yeah.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.992
<i>Runnin' around</i>

52:00.200 --> 52:03.295
<i>I can't hardly stand it</i>

52:08.500 --> 52:10.173
Shit.

52:22.264 --> 52:23.811
Oh.

52:24.016 --> 52:27.111
What a lovely place.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.360
<i>Vitis vinifera</i>, hello.

52:37.488 --> 52:41.163
Look at that. Fucking zombie shit.

52:41.367 --> 52:44.496
The grid. It's so antiquated.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.626
I mean, what century is this?

52:46.830 --> 52:50.130
Tesla had light bulbs you didn't
even have to plug in in 1895.

52:50.334 --> 52:54.305
- But it's not even connected.
- Yeah, I disconnected all that.

52:59.843 --> 53:03.893
Oh, what a hidden
treasure, my darling.

53:04.098 --> 53:05.395
Did you make that?

53:05.599 --> 53:09.149
Well, I cobbled it together
from bits and pieces.

53:09.353 --> 53:12.607
It's beautiful.
You're an alchemist.

53:12.815 --> 53:18.413
I just need to check the
charges and the connections.

53:18.612 --> 53:21.536
All right, this might
need recalibration.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.999
Are these the antennae?

53:26.912 --> 53:28.539
Yeah.

53:28.747 --> 53:33.548
They're receiving electrical
information from the atmosphere.

53:33.752 --> 53:37.507
- From outer space.
- They get converted into energy

53:37.715 --> 53:39.843
- by this dynamo here.
- Mm.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.927
Hang on. Let me just see this.

54:02.281 --> 54:03.999
<i>Amanita muscaria.</i>

54:05.492 --> 54:07.335
How odd.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.498
- Adam?
- Yeah?

54:11.707 --> 54:14.085
Have you noticed these?

54:15.711 --> 54:16.837
Yeah.

54:19.715 --> 54:21.217
Fly agaric.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.393
They're behaving rather strangely.

54:23.594 --> 54:26.188
- You know, this is not their season.
- I know.

54:26.388 --> 54:30.188
They kind of appear and then disappear
and then reappear, those caps.

54:30.392 --> 54:34.317
I guess they're receiving information
from the atmosphere like my antennae.

54:35.189 --> 54:39.319
Just goes to show, we don't
know shit about fungi.

54:39.818 --> 54:43.163
Even though life on this planet
couldn't exist without them.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.618
You know, you guys
shouldn't really be here.

54:48.243 --> 54:50.496
Not until the autumn.

55:03.467 --> 55:04.889
Evening.

55:05.093 --> 55:08.347
What's going on, my love?
Are we playing doctors?

55:08.555 --> 55:11.308
I am. I have to go out
for about an hour or so.

55:11.517 --> 55:14.737
- Am I not included?
- Not this time.

55:14.937 --> 55:18.612
1968. Surely you could
do with a newer one.

55:18.816 --> 55:21.035
Have you ever used this on anyone?

55:21.235 --> 55:26.366
Dr. Faust? Right.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.253
What is it, my darling?

55:32.496 --> 55:36.797
I had a dream about your sister.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.967
Not a good one, then.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.799
Well, I suppose it
could've been worse.

55:44.550 --> 55:46.678
But not by much.

55:50.931 --> 55:53.775
- Back in a flash.
- I hope so.

55:54.226 --> 55:57.150
Good luck with the surgery, doctor.

56:10.117 --> 56:16.170
June 23rd, 1868.

56:17.124 --> 56:19.252
Our third wedding.

56:20.168 --> 56:22.341
We look so young.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.378
Marlowe.

57:28.987 --> 57:31.331
<i>Dalbergia retusa.</i>

57:36.411 --> 57:39.210
This has been newly made.

57:55.055 --> 58:00.357
You're looking awfully
pale there, Dr. Caligari.

58:00.560 --> 58:03.939
Maybe you need to get a
little more sunlight.

58:04.147 --> 58:08.823
Vitamin D deficiency can
have serious consequences.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.274
Fresh blood, baby.

58:42.394 --> 58:44.317
What's this about?

58:44.521 --> 58:49.027
Just tell me that you're having trouble with
one of the others. Please tell me that.

58:50.485 --> 58:52.738
I don't see any others.

58:53.572 --> 58:54.744
Ever.

58:58.410 --> 59:00.003
Okay.

59:11.465 --> 59:13.968
Don't ever fuck around like that.

59:14.176 --> 59:17.521
Just playing a part in your story.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.188
It's the zombies I'm sick of.

59:23.435 --> 59:27.235
And their fear of their
own fucking imaginations.

59:27.439 --> 59:30.363
My darling, that's true.

59:32.402 --> 59:33.449
Meanwhile...

59:35.405 --> 59:39.126
just tell me what's so not
frightened about that.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:19.288
How can you have lived for so
long and still not get it?

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:25.251
This self-obsession,

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.925
it's a waste of living...

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:35.516
that could be spent
on surviving things,

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.801
appreciating nature,

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.855
nurturing kindness and friendship.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.900
And dancing.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:54.994
You've been pretty
lucky in love, though,

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.701
if I may say so.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.500
<i>Somebody tell me</i>

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.752
<i>What does this man got</i>

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.300
<i>He makes me feel</i>

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:54.799
<i>What I don't wanna feel</i>

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:57.847
<i>Somebody tell me</i>

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.849
<i>What has this man got</i>

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.223
<i>He makes me give</i>

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.101
<i>What I don't wanna give</i>

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.807
<i>On solid ground</i>

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:10.026
<i>I feel myself sinkin' fast</i>

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.316
<i>I grab ahold</i>

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:15.323
<i>But I don't think it's gonna last</i>

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:18.702
<i>I'm slowly losin' my ground</i>

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.121
<i>Slowly sinkin' down</i>

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:25.705
<i>Trapped by this thing
they call love</i>

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.041
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:33.759
<i>Hooked on this thing called love</i>

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:38.764
<i>Hooked on this thing called love</i>

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.765
<i>Somebody tell me</i>

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.013
<i>What does this man got</i>

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.516
<i>He makes me cry</i>

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.064
<i>Lord, I don't wanna cry</i>

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:49.891
<i>He calls me up</i>

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.357
<i>And I tell 'em to
say that I'm not in</i>

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.693
<i>Then I cry all night</i>

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.529
<i>If he doesn't call again</i>

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.987
<i>I'm slowly losin' my ground</i>

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.573
<i>Slowly sinkin' down</i>

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:08.789
<i>Trapped by this thing
they call love</i>

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.079
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.335
<i>I'm trapped</i>

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.676
<i>I can't help myself</i>

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:19.296
<i>I'm hooked on you baby</i>

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:21.381
<i>I just can't help it</i>

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:27.020
<i>I can never be happy
Loving no one else</i>

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:31.100
<i>Oh, baby
I love you</i>

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.111
It's a full moon.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.987
Did you know that there's
a diamond up there

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.573
the size of a planet?

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.876
It's a white dwarf. It's the
compressed heart of a star.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.629
And it's not only a
radiant diamond,

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:01.760
but it also emits the
music of a gigantic gong.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:07.978
A diamond that emits the music

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.182
- of a gigantic gong.
- Gigantic gong.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.275
Where is it?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:20.108
It's just 50 light-years away
in the constellation Centaurus.

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:21.817
Hm.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:26.329
I wonder what it sounds like.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:53.273
I have to tell you something.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:58.486
I also had a dream about my sister.

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:04.117
As did Marlowe before
I left Tangier.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:06.453
I think she's looking for us.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.121
Fuck.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:12.993
Well, I mean, it's
been quite some time.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:14.919
Yeah, not long enough.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.129
Shouldn't she be sleeping
in a coffin somewhere?

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:23.302
With a wooden stake shoved in?

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.380
- Adam, she's my sister.
- Is she now?

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:29.468
Well, we are related by blood.

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.916
I didn't leave these lights on.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.424
That's your music.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.840
Ava.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.838
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:54.227
Oh, my God, it's so
great to see you.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.767
Mm.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.397
You're still so beautiful.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.986
May I?

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.738
My amazing sister, I've missed you.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:14.868
- Did you get my message?
- I might have. I had a dream.

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.701
Oh, how cool. It worked.

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:20.458
There's your spooky
action at a distance.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.539
Yeah, well, spooky action anyway.

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:24.875
What are you guys talking about?

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.085
You do know that it's very bad luck

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:30.843
to cross a threshold
without being invited?

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.762
Are you still afraid of garlic?

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:37.267
I'm not talking about
myths here, Ava.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:42.351
You know it's also bad luck to listen
to someone's music without invitation?

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:45.316
My God, I love it, Adam.
It's totally brilliant.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.522
- Can I get a download?
- No.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.233
So?

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.411
- You just passing through Detroit?
- Yeah.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.488
No, I mean, I came to see you.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.907
I've been living in L.A.

01:07:58.116 --> 01:07:59.663
Great.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.999
Zombie central.

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:04.919
Are you alone?

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:06.841
No.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.920
I'm here with you guys.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.883
Fuck. Well, you can't stay here.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.223
- Adam.
- No fucking way.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.600
- Not after last time.
- Oh, Adam, it's been 87 years.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:24.192
What? When?

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:26.611
Are you still upset
about that Paris thing?

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:31.741
Well, are you okay?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.488
Yeah, but I'm...

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:36.867
I'm really, really, really hungry.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.497
Do you maybe have something?

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.667
Could you smell it all
the way from L.A.?

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.627
Come on.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.636
Ava.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.808
I just wanna see where you keep it.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.511
No.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:10.397
It is so amazing to see you.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.863
We're gonna have so
much fun together.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.957
She drank a hell of a
lot of our O-negative.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:29.006
I know.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:34.300
But she's been traveling,
and that fries you, you know?

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.388
It'll be all right.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.721
It's always a bit
weird with family.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:53.948
Where's she sleeping, though?

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:57.402
I put her in that little
bedroom downstairs.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.827
Which little bedroom?

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:02.032
You know, the little
one down the corridor.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:09.129
I'll have to put my tapes
in the bloody safe now.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.675
Don't worry. Go to sleep now.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:16.095
She's out cold, and
it's getting light out.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:19.640
You can do all that
when we get up tonight.

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:23.178
Just think of that
magical musical diamond

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:27.607
in the sky. It's above us now.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.922
Eve? Adam?

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:54.501
- What is it, Ava?
- Can I come in?

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.302
No.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.551
Isn't it time to get up?

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:03.263
Darling, can't we sleep
a little longer?

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.892
But it's dark out already.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.942
I'm starving.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:14.896
Go away. We're still sleeping.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:19.655
In a little while, we'll all get up and
have breakfast together, all right?

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.827
Some more of that good stuff?

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.952
- Sure.
- Where do you keep it?

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:30.628
You go and get dressed and
we'll bring you some, all right?

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.330
Okay.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:36.049
- Peekaboo.
- Ugh.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.298
I see you.

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:01.781
<i>Come in, little girl.</i>

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:06.705
<i>Let me do it.</i>

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:12.002
<i>Soul Dracula.</i>

01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:25.341
- What the hell is this?
- Heh, heh.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:30.723
Oh, this is from French
television, 1975.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.987
- Hey.
- You're pressing your luck, Ava.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:43.034
Why did you turn it off? I love
that. I found it on YouTube.

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:45.111
Of course, you did.

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.697
Unh. I don't feel well.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:50.909
What is it, sweetheart?
You think it's all the traveling?

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:53.745
- Maybe.
- It's probably blood poisoning.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.206
- Don't joke, Adam.
- I'm not.

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.668
Are you taking care of your
nutrition? You have to be careful.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:03.801
- There's a lot of contamination around.
- I try.

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:07.805
Hey, you guys fed without me.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.773
Take it easy. Shit.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.891
- My God, that is good. I want more.
- No, you've had more than enough.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.308
This is pure shit.

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.888
You're gonna drain our whole
fucking supply, so take it easy.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.689
Fine.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.109
I wanna hear some of your music.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.187
No. I told you, it's private.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:05.324
Oh, yeah? Well, how come
I heard it in L.A. then?

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:06.992
What? Where'd you hear it?

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.745
In, like, an underground
music club.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.497
I don't believe you.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.074
So don't.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:18.038
- How did you know it was mine, then?
- Oh, come on, I could tell immediately.

01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:22.170
I might have been born at night,
but I wasn't born last night.

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:40.105
Fine. Then I'm gonna go out.
I wanna hear some music.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:44.530
- Good idea. Go out.
- Oh, but I wanna go with you two.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.107
No.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.613
You're so fucking boring.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:51.571
Bet he never takes you
out, ever, right?

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:54.077
Well, no, we do go for a drive,

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.283
- from time to time.
- Oh, a drive.

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.961
Well, that's exciting.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:02.040
I mean, go somewhere
where there's music.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.504
Don't you wanna go, Eve?

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:06.131
Well, I wouldn't mind.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.758
We are in Detroit.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.177
- Yeah!
- No.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.009
Adam's gonna take us out.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.936
No, Adam is not going
to take you out.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.943
All I need

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.327
We're all the same

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.847
Yeah.

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:41.147
- They're awesome. They're so good.
- They were great.

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:54.114
You all have such
awesome gloves, man.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:57.071
Where, uh...? Where'd you...?
Where'd you get them?

01:16:57.988 --> 01:16:59.706
- Hey, Ian.
- Scott.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.705
- How's it going?
- How are you?

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:04.879
- It was the Danny & the Darleans gig.
- I think so, yeah.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:08.128
- I got something for you. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.130
Yeah.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.850
- That was great. Awesome.
- So good, yeah.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:21.304
- So you remember about that 12-inch?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:24.015
- Let me... Let me go grab it.
- Okay, cool.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.660
- Check it out, man. Triple black, man.
- Whoa.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:45.370
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:48.047
- 180 gram vinyl?
- 180 gram, man.

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.966
- Amazing.
- Yeah. No printing anywhere.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.420
Yeah, that's awesome, man.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.675
So mysterious.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.765
Thanks, man.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.151
Nice meeting you.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:14.615
Wow, man, this is... This
is so great, you know?

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:18.991
I couldn't get this guy to just come
out and see some live music, you know?

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.698
- Did you like it, Adam?
- Yes.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:25.251
- Adam, you wanna meet White Hills?
- No.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:28.125
Cool, man. I read you.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.308
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's so rude of me.

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:52.736
Could I get you a beer or anything,
Eve? You know, something to drink?

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:55.360
I'm Ava. She's Eve.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.740
I'm so sorry. Eve, can
I get you something?

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:02.493
- A beer?
- No, thank you, nothing.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:07.076
Ava? Oh, very nice.
You brought your own.

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:09.787
What is that? Jagermeister?

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.248
- Where did you get that?
- At home.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:16.048
- "At home"? You mean at my house?
- Yeah. Want some?

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.970
- No.
- I'll have some.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:40.026
Do you think I could
get in on that? Just...

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.032
- Sure, Ian.
- Cool.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:46.828
Whoa, man. Heh.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:50.662
That was like some
martial-arts-type shit.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:54.840
Man, this guy is just...
He's amazing, man, you know?

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.293
- He's brilliant.
- He is brilliant.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:00.675
Do you know I can't tell anyone
about him? How weird is that?

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:04.474
Like, I had to sign a confidentiality
agreement and everything.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.891
That's your music.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.908
Are you gonna dance
with me, rock star?

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:29.743
- What? Now?
- Yeah.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.106
Eve, we gotta go. Right now.

01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:58.813
All right. Just cool it.

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:02.400
Okay? Don't draw attention
to yourself. Just go easy.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.369
- Ava.
- Hm?

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.605
Ava.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:39.194
Adam, think we could
hear your new stuff?

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:40.772
Now is not a good time.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.949
Seems like a great time.
We're all here, you know?

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:50.699
Yeah, I got you. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. I'm just getting excited.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.829
Me too.

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:55.498
Adam?

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:01.501
Adam, could I have that
flask back, please?

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.555
No, Ava. No more tonight.

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:10.847
- I'm just really thirsty.
- We should all just go to bed.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.855
I mean, it's getting light out,
and I think it's time to retire.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:17.524
- Well, do you wanna share some of this?
- Hm.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.351
Ian.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.064
I think, um... I think
it's time for you to go.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.282
- Yeah.
- He's gonna go

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:30.283
- as soon as he's finished his little beer.
- Yeah, I should... I should get going.

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:32.535
Yeah, he's gonna go
in just a second.

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:37.119
An excellent idea. Good night, baby.
Good night, Ian. Very nice to meet you.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:40.797
- I hope to see you again.
- Yeah, I sure hope so.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:43.421
You're leaving soon, right?

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.925
Yeah. No, I'm... I'm going, man.

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.653
Yeah, it's...

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.286
- I'm gonna...
- Heh, heh.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.161
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:17.163
Really? Heh.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.628
Uh...

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:29.881
Peekaboo. I see you.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.264
Peeka... Peekaboo.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:44.358
Don't even dare say it.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.439
Hm.

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:51.110
- Is it dark outside?
- Yeah.

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:55.614
What are you doing with this?

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:58.496
I've filled a little
something for Ava.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.625
- Oh, fuck.
- I'm gonna go and check on her.

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:07.210
But you're right, darling.
She's got to go.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:10.637
- I need you all to myself again.
- Hm.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.470
Good idea.

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:15.972
Before it's too late.

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:29.527
Mm. Well, I guess I'm
getting up, then.

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:40.625
Ava?

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:52.012
Ava?

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:28.378
Fuck.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:31.918
Ow.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.966
- Eve.
- This is the bloody 21st century.

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:38.721
Oh, I didn't mean to.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.895
He was just so cute.
Now I feel sick.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.769
What do you expect? He's
from the music industry.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.522
Oh, just back off.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:25:59.950
You drank Ian.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:04.160
- Adam...
- You drank Ian.

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.292
Sorry.

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:12.004
We can sort this. Ava is leaving.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:15.588
Just get off me, Eve.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:20.051
How many times?

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:23.102
I don't mean to. Ow!

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:24.767
Let go.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:29.943
What the fuck? That's my stuff.

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:31.736
Get the fuck out of my house.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:38.402
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Go back and rot in fucking L.A.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:42.789
You know what you guys are?
You're condescending snobs.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:45.617
You have no fucking idea.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.870
Fuck you!

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:52.833
Go fuck each other!

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:10.396
Oh, my love.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.771
He seemed like such
a lovely fellow.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.444
Why couldn't she just
have turned him?

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:23.701
- Can anybody link you two?
- Are you joking?

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.497
We were all out
together last night.

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:31.171
So much for that
confidentiality agreement.

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:34.504
Where's his car?

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:36.802
He left it down by
the club. Remember?

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:40.006
Yeah, well, it'll be
gone in a day or two.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:48.809
Look what she did to my Gibson.

01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:50.891
The 1905.

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:57.276
Wow.

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:02.282
How beautifully made it is inside.

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:05.410
Yeah.

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:26.969
Have you got a bit of old carpet?

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:30.313
Behind the sofa.

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:40.195
Shall we?

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.158
Yeah.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.999
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Yep. Okay, you got it?

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:55.297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:59.176
- No, his feet first.
- Feet first. Put his feet in first.

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:01.879
- Just bend the knees.
- Yep.

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.973
- Careful with his head.
- Ooh!

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:10.145
All right.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.932
What are we gonna do with him?

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:58.022
I mean, it's not like in the old
days when we could just chuck them

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:01.400
in the Thames alongside all the
other tubercular floaters.

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.323
Any other ideas?

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:54.412
<i>Canis latrans</i>. How lovely.

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:57.419
I think they're clocking you.

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:00.964
Yeah. They're all over Detroit.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.961
Come on, Eve.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.028
Don't even ask.

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:29.735
Ready?

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:01.233
That certainly was visual.

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:15.906
Hello? Good evening. I would
like to book two flights

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:19.163
from Detroit to Tangier,
traveling at night.

01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:23.208
Who is it?

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.669
Some rock 'n' roll zombie kids.

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:30.257
They're onto me.

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.760
Yes, well, be grateful
it's not the police.

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:37.269
Yes, I'm still here.

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:40.187
Thank you. Yes.

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.564
Two tickets, first class, leaving
and arriving at night, please.

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:47.738
Yes, I'm sorry.
I know it's complicated.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.607
Connecting through London?

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.401
No, no, I'm sorry.
London's no good.

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:58.707
Yeah. Is there another connection?

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:04.872
Madrid. Madrid's fine.

01:33:05.205 --> 01:33:07.458
Yes, two travelers. No luggage.

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:09.801
What about all my instruments?

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:13.380
My darling, the world is full
of beautiful instruments.

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:17.263
I'm gonna find you a magical
instrument in Tangier.

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:19.306
Yes, just carry-on.

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:21.729
Can you carry on blood?

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:23.227
Kit has the best stuff.

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.813
As soon as we arrive.

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:29.563
Yes, credit card.
Which would you like?

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:32.698
Yes.

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:38.781
The names of Stephan Dedalus
and Daisy Buchanan.

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:41.453
Chet Atkins.

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:44.160
Dates of birth...

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:01.347
Do you need something?

01:36:18.147 --> 01:36:20.991
I have something very
special for you.

01:36:29.867 --> 01:36:32.086
Not far to go now.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:33.834
Come on.

01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:45.243
Shit, Marlowe, where are you?

01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:53.743
Adam.

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:02.461
Ow.

01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:05.388
Ow. What was that for?

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:07.340
Come on.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:11.765
Where are we?

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:17.521
Did you find Marlowe?

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:21.275
No, but we've got to go find him.
You've got to get up. Come on.

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:25.575
If I can even fucking walk.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:03.981
Psst. I have something
very special for you.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.735
I have what you need.

01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:08.572
Not what I need.

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.199
Oh, fuck. Kit.

01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:03.168
Bilal.

01:40:03.372 --> 01:40:05.215
- Madame Eve.
- Bilal.

01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:10.178
Monsieur Adam.

01:40:10.379 --> 01:40:11.426
Bilal.

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:14.134
Come in. Come in, please. Come in.

01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:20.853
Madame Eve,

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:24.273
my teacher is not well.

01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:29.027
This is a very, very bad situation.

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:31.237
Very bad.

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:35.121
You... You look not good.

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:38.788
Please. Please.

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:54.390
This way.

01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:05.902
Well, well.

01:41:06.477 --> 01:41:09.572
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:23.499
You look like shit.

01:41:27.415 --> 01:41:29.918
My old darling.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:38.847
Oh, yeah.

01:41:40.303 --> 01:41:43.102
What a piece of work is a man.

01:41:44.181 --> 01:41:47.025
What is this quintessence of dust?

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:52.482
What happened, Kit?

01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:08.836
This is the very last
of the good stuff.

01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:33.280
No more good French doctor.

01:42:38.152 --> 01:42:40.826
I got some bad stuff.

01:42:42.782 --> 01:42:45.160
Contaminated.

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:49.255
Avoid the hospital here.

01:42:54.627 --> 01:42:57.255
You still been scratching
away, though, Kit.

01:42:57.463 --> 01:42:58.806
Well, you know...

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:02.685
here and there over the centuries.

01:43:06.222 --> 01:43:08.065
Bilal.

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.526
Bilal...

01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:20.320
is an excellent writer in
his own right, you know.

01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:23.239
Maybe not yet.

01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:28.291
Humility gets you nowhere.

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.962
There's the proof of that.
Heh, heh, heh.

01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:38.805
Illiterate zombie philistine.

01:43:42.383 --> 01:43:45.136
The game paid off, though, Kit.

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:48.601
You still got the work out there.

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:51.559
Never had much choice.

01:43:51.976 --> 01:43:53.899
It was all...

01:43:55.354 --> 01:43:57.652
so political.

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:02.571
Anyway, I was supposed to be...

01:44:03.487 --> 01:44:05.114
dead.

01:44:08.617 --> 01:44:10.745
And now...

01:44:12.204 --> 01:44:15.128
at last...

01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:20.588
I shall be.

01:45:53.806 --> 01:45:56.104
Oh, Eve.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:44.857
Oh, look at that shit.

01:46:56.785 --> 01:46:59.129
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

01:47:09.048 --> 01:47:11.517
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

01:47:15.804 --> 01:47:18.353
I'm gonna get you that present.

01:47:19.892 --> 01:47:22.315
Give me all your money, baby.

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.698
Come on.

01:47:44.917 --> 01:47:46.419
Now...

01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:50.556
you're gonna stay here. Okay?

01:47:50.756 --> 01:47:54.806
And I'm gonna go around the
corner just for a minute.

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:58.765
No funny business.

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:09.775
- Okay.
- Hm.

01:51:28.974 --> 01:51:31.272
Eve, this bird is fantastic.

01:51:31.476 --> 01:51:34.195
Yasmine. She's Lebanese.

01:51:34.396 --> 01:51:36.740
I'm sure she'll be very famous.

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:39.068
God, I hope not.

01:51:39.401 --> 01:51:41.870
She's way too good for that.

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.123
Come on, baby.

01:51:51.622 --> 01:51:53.841
Look at the bowl.

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:04.427
<i>Dalbergia retusa</i> ?

01:52:04.635 --> 01:52:05.807
Hm.

01:52:21.235 --> 01:52:23.363
It's beautiful.

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:28.409
Thank you.

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:51.189
Eighty-two percent of
human blood is water.

01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:54.142
Have the water wars started yet?

01:52:54.351 --> 01:52:56.353
Or is it still about the oil?

01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:59.565
Yes, they're just starting now.

01:53:00.524 --> 01:53:05.030
They only figure it out
when it's too late.

01:53:07.531 --> 01:53:10.455
How much of the human
body is water?

01:53:10.951 --> 01:53:12.919
Fifty-five to 60 percent.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:16.044
And how much of the
Earth's surface?

01:53:17.416 --> 01:53:20.420
Well, 70 percent is ocean and...

01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:23.214
then there are lakes and...

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:25.386
And the rivers.

01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:48.033
Oh.

01:53:49.531 --> 01:53:51.329
Fuck.

01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:54.124
I'm barely still here.

01:53:56.121 --> 01:53:58.590
We're finished, aren't we?

01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:25.192
Tell me now about entanglement.

01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:29.409
Einstein's spooky
action at a distance.

01:54:29.613 --> 01:54:32.617
Is it related to quantum theory?

01:54:33.116 --> 01:54:34.584
Mm.

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:40.212
No, I mean, it's not a
theory, it's proven.

01:54:40.582 --> 01:54:42.630
How does it go again?

01:54:44.336 --> 01:54:47.306
When you separate an
entwined particle

01:54:47.506 --> 01:54:51.477
and you move both parts
away from the other,

01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:54.479
even at opposite ends
of the universe,

01:54:54.679 --> 01:54:58.024
if you alter or affect one,

01:54:58.225 --> 01:55:02.150
the other will be identically
altered or affected.

01:55:02.562 --> 01:55:04.314
Spooky.

01:55:04.523 --> 01:55:07.902
Even at opposite ends
of the universe?

01:55:08.402 --> 01:55:10.325
Yeah.

01:55:15.117 --> 01:55:17.415
Is that what we're thinking?

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.456
Adam, really.

01:55:21.665 --> 01:55:24.965
So fucking 15th century.

01:55:27.129 --> 01:55:30.554
They are deliciously beautiful,
though, aren't they?

01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:36.354
What choice do we have, really?

01:55:36.805 --> 01:55:39.729
We're just gonna turn
them, though, right?

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:43.312
How romantic of you.

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.699
I get the girl, though.
