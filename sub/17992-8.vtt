Announcer: Previously on
"Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood".

00:04.971 --> 00:06.840
{\an8}You're going to put your
energy into this bitch?

00:06.906 --> 00:08.842
{\an8}I've got to sit back and
watch you work with her?

00:08.908 --> 00:11.444
{\an8}I made up my mind, yeah,
that's what I'm going to do.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.345
{\an8}How does that sound, John?

00:12.412 --> 00:12.912
{\an8}Is it good?

00:12.979 --> 00:13.613
{\an8}Good.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.881
{\an8}Is this the Berg record?

00:14.948 --> 00:16.383
{\an8}His hook, his beat, my heart.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.885
{\an8}I'm taking it he hasn't
heard these lyrics yet.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.620
{\an8}Friends don't write [bleep]
four songs about

00:20.687 --> 00:23.089
{\an8}[bleep] four-page letters and
all this other [bleep].

00:23.156 --> 00:24.124
{\an8}There's a rap for that.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.759
{\an8}You can't use any
of my material.

00:25.825 --> 00:26.760
{\an8}You started
working with Teairra.

00:26.826 --> 00:27.427
{\an8}Who, my boo?

00:27.494 --> 00:28.428
{\an8}That's your boo now?

00:28.495 --> 00:34.834
{\an8}I believe in her more
than I believe in you.

00:34.901 --> 00:36.169
{\an8}[bleep] play with me.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.171
{\an8}[bleep] out of here.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.540
{\an8}Get these fake
ass Louis glasses.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.009
{\an8}You got my assistant fired
because you had to try to add

00:43.076 --> 00:45.979
{\an8}her to some kind of interview
[bleep] that you had going on.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.113
{\an8}How did I get her fired?

00:47.180 --> 00:48.314
{\an8}Because I asked her to?

00:48.381 --> 00:49.149
{\an8}She's fired.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.250
{\an8}Can you get him
out of here please?

00:50.316 --> 00:51.751
{\an8}[bleep] you and
[bleep] security.

00:51.818 --> 00:52.819
{\an8}Get your [bleep].

00:52.886 --> 00:54.354
{\an8}If this is how you
want to do this [bleep].

00:54.421 --> 00:55.855
{\an8}You gotta go.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.223
{\an8}Broadcaster 1: Ray J was
arrested in Beverly Hills

00:57.290 --> 00:58.758
{\an8}on Friday night.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.994
{\an8}Broadcaster 2: Cops said that
Ray J became combative and spit

01:01.060 --> 01:02.996
{\an8}in one of the officers' faces.

01:03.062 --> 01:06.232
{\an8}I'm thinking you're dealing with
something you can't control.

01:06.299 --> 01:09.436
{\an8}I don't got a drinking problem,
but I got a problem with people

01:09.502 --> 01:11.771
{\an8}[bleep] with me
when I'm drinking.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.673
{\an8}Made me feel like you're
going to lead him off.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.809
{\an8}Why do you feel like
you can trust her?

01:15.875 --> 01:18.178
{\an8}I'm not going to say
I can fully trust her.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.879
{\an8}Waitress: Calling from
the Capital Grill in Miami.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.215
{\an8}I just wanted to confirm
your dinner reservation.

01:22.282 --> 01:25.218
{\an8}You got a Miami area
code calling you for dinner

01:25.285 --> 01:27.187
{\an8}reservations and you
can't explain where it is.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.388
{\an8}You're not
catching me at anything.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.656
{\an8}I did catch you.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.690
{\an8}You didn't catch me in anything.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.891
{\an8}Don't act like I haven't.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.294
{\an8}I don't care if Maderas's
daughter has an issue with you,

01:34.360 --> 01:36.729
{\an8}I want you to be
the face of my club.

01:36.796 --> 01:37.997
{\an8}You said he said
he loved you, right?

01:38.064 --> 01:39.065
{\an8}We both did.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.867
{\an8}The only reason I even
said it is because my hair

01:40.934 --> 01:42.535
{\an8}was being pulled.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.804
{\an8}I feel like you lied to me and
I feel like you embarrassed me.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.306
{\an8}I'm washing my hands
of our relationship.

01:46.372 --> 01:48.141
{\an8}You're not an angel,
you're out there partying.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.542
{\an8}I'm not an angel, but I
didn't do [bleep] to you,

01:49.609 --> 01:51.411
{\an8}but you and Masika,
you [bleep] a lot and

01:51.478 --> 01:54.013
{\an8}you didn't even allow
her to respect me.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.349
{\an8}Get rid of all his
[bleep] and close the door.

01:56.416 --> 02:06.392
{\an5}♪♪

02:06.459 --> 02:31.017
{\an5}♪♪

02:42.328 --> 02:45.064
I finally got this record mixed
and mastered for Teairra,

02:45.131 --> 02:48.067
so you know what, I wanted to do
something extra special for her.

02:48.134 --> 02:51.871
Hey, you got my favorite
fruit up in here in this space?

02:51.938 --> 02:54.307
In my mind it's all
about presentation.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.109
Sometimes it helps
when you throw a little

02:56.175 --> 02:57.911
icing on that cake.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.078
See, T.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.213
Oh, you got
champagne, everything.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.481
Have a glass.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.750
Okay, yay.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.519
Oh, thank you, I appreciate it.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.321
I walk in today and it's

03:09.656 --> 03:12.625
{\an5}He's doing the most, but
it's strictly business for me.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.895
I'm ready to hear what kind of
musical magic we've created.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.730
Okay, let's toast
before we hear it.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.432
We toast to an incredible mix.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.101
I don't want have no
negative energy around us,

03:22.168 --> 03:23.236

So, me and Teairra Marie
were making beautiful music.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.914
{\an5}Everybody's not a fan of it.

04:41.981 --> 04:45.718
{\an5}I went and told Hazel that
TT is my boo, my bae,

04:45.785 --> 04:47.920
and the [bleep] went
buck wild on me.

04:47.987 --> 04:51.424
Hazel and TT are no longer cool,
but I gotta give her a heads up

04:51.491 --> 04:53.960
just in case Hazel
come gunning for her.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.628
I'm saying, girl, Hazel.

04:55.695 --> 04:56.562
What happened?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.464
She has a serious
problem with the fact

04:58.531 --> 04:59.966
of me and you
working together.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.803
You are her enemy and I should
never be working her enemy.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.773
She was just saying you're a bum
bitch and you're this and that.

05:06.839 --> 05:07.974
Who me?

05:08.041 --> 05:08.975
Yeah.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.677
She didn't say none of
that [bleep] to my face.

05:10.743 --> 05:14.580
So, if she's saying all that
[bleep] right now to you because

05:14.647 --> 05:16.783
you're working with me,
that's some [bleep] and

05:16.849 --> 05:17.950
I don't appreciate it.

05:18.017 --> 05:18.885
I'm not going to lie.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.820
Hazel's just mad because
Berg is showing me

05:20.887 --> 05:22.255
any piece of attention.

05:22.321 --> 05:24.924
It's not my fault that I'm
getting serenaded with roses

05:24.991 --> 05:28.227
and wine and a song just for me.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.929
Don't blame it on me, honey,
that your relationship

05:29.996 --> 05:31.164
was imaginary.

05:31.230 --> 05:34.834
It's not like we [bleep], so
what's the point of being upset

05:34.901 --> 05:39.105
about us working together and
having chemistry when we come

05:39.172 --> 05:41.674
to the studio and do
what we're doing?

05:41.741 --> 05:44.377
You're a talented writer and
producer and I'm a talented

05:44.444 --> 05:49.582
singer, so let's [bleep] all
that [bleep] to the wayside and

05:49.649 --> 05:53.086
[bleep] focus on our musical
marriage and [bleep] all the

05:53.152 --> 05:55.321
other [bleep], because if a
bitch is talking [bleep] about

05:55.388 --> 05:57.990
me, then [bleep]
her, I don't care.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.559
Am I wrong?

05:59.625 --> 06:00.860
No, you're right.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.128
Okay, it is what it is.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.597
If that's how she feels, then I
ain't got nothing nice to say

06:04.664 --> 06:05.932
about her either.

♪♪

06:16.042 --> 06:22.882

06:22.949 --> 06:24.317
{\an5}I'm still tight
about the situation that

06:24.383 --> 06:25.651
{\an5}happened with Berg.

06:25.718 --> 06:29.555
After I just put my heart
into this record, what do I get?

06:29.622 --> 06:31.057
More [bleep].

06:31.124 --> 06:33.159
And he [bleep] dumped
all my [bleep] into the

06:33.226 --> 06:34.494
middle of the street.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.696
So, I'm going to take my ass
to the gym and work out and

06:36.763 --> 06:40.433
hopefully get this [bleep] out
of my system once and for all.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.435
That was a good workout.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.437
It was like intense.

06:44.504 --> 06:48.107
You didn't really seem like you
was into it that much though.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.443
{\an8}Things getting crazy in Hazel's
world and you heard me record

06:50.510 --> 06:52.311
the record that Berg gave me.

06:52.378 --> 06:56.482
So, I play him the record and
this little [bleep] was like,

06:56.549 --> 06:58.251
"I ain't [bleep] with that.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.118
I don't like that.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.186
I ain't going to
[bleep] cosign that."

07:00.253 --> 07:02.388
He just like snapped on
me and I'm like, "Pause."

07:02.455 --> 07:03.790
He didn't like
what you were saying?

07:03.856 --> 07:05.525
He definitely
didn't like the lyrics.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.426
He said he wasn't going to
cosign it, wanted to take the

07:07.493 --> 07:09.095
record back about me.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.231
Then he keeps throwing up all
this Teairra stuff like,

07:12.298 --> 07:13.900
"She a better artist
than you, she a better look,

07:13.966 --> 07:14.667
that's my boo."

07:14.734 --> 07:15.802
He said, "That's my boo."

07:15.868 --> 07:16.869
I said, "Boo, like what?"

07:16.936 --> 07:18.938
He like, "I mean,
I'm not [bleep] her."

07:19.005 --> 07:22.275
I mean, when I call
somebody my boo, that's my boo.

07:22.341 --> 07:25.111
I don't call [bleep] my
boo unless we booing up.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.546
I can only sit here
and take so much.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.282
I felt like it was just
coming negative insults, insult,

07:29.348 --> 07:30.516
insult, downgrade.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.853
He grabs me,
trying to restrain me.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.421
Then hops out the car
and throws my bag all

07:35.488 --> 07:37.023
over the streets, girl.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.692
Are you mad because he took your
record back, because he gave

07:39.759 --> 07:42.895
Teairra a record, or because
they might be [bleep] around?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.530
I think it's a
combination of the three.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.432
I think it's fraud,
fraud and even more fraud.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.734
You all about the girl code,
I'm all about keeping it 100.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.836
Me and Berg talk.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.470
I see the girls he
be running with.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.139
He laughs, he makes jokes.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.341
So, for me, just knowing him how
I know him and how close

07:55.408 --> 07:56.876
that we are.

07:56.943 --> 07:57.977
I didn't even know that
y'all were that close,

07:58.044 --> 07:58.978
that's what's so crazy.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.213
We were always close.

08:00.279 --> 08:03.115
We actually digressed our
friendship because

08:03.182 --> 08:04.350
of your relationship.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.252
I didn't want to be
in the middle of it.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.155
I knew that Berg and Masika were
friends, but it's kind of funny

08:09.222 --> 08:11.657
how she's acting
like they're besties.

08:11.724 --> 08:15.494
I find it kind of odd because he
ain't never mentioned it to me.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.865
He's done so much to
you over and over again.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.434
You've let it slide and let it
go at this point you gotta be

08:21.500 --> 08:24.437
like the big
person and [bleep] it.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.639
Because he gonna keep
doing it if you let him.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.741
I'm walking away, I'm
done with the situation.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.610
I'm like, "Good luck."

08:30.676 --> 08:33.946
And I think that's
what's best for both of us.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.648
But you know,
speaking of frauds,

08:35.715 --> 08:37.416
I told you about my photoshoot.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.150
I got the pictures back from it.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.953
Let me see.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.655
We're going to be doing a
billboard, an unveiling party.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.124
I would love for you to come.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.693
Woo.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.761
Damn.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.029
Titties looking right.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.531
You should come, relax, let your
hair down, have a drink and just

08:52.598 --> 08:54.600
forget about all the [bleep].

08:54.667 --> 09:01.440
This Berg, this Teairra,
all the [bleep], [bleep] it.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.843

Since the last time
I saw Amanda,

everything I suspected
to be true was true.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.958
{\an5}She swore up and down she wasn't
going to this dinner in Miami,

09:19.025 --> 09:21.060
which technically was the truth
because this dude

09:21.127 --> 09:23.062
is right here in LA.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.332
I'm driving down the street,
minding my own business and who

09:26.399 --> 09:30.803
pulls up on the side, not only
Amanda, but her and the dude.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.939
Meanwhile she's
ignoring my calls.

09:33.005 --> 09:35.341
Of course I'm hurt,
but I'm also angry.

What's up?

Nothing, what's going on?

09:39.045 --> 09:40.613
A lot.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.214
What?

09:42.281 --> 09:44.116
You going to sit here and act
stupid like you don't know?

09:44.183 --> 09:45.384
I've been trying to call you and
talk to you for a couple of days

09:45.451 --> 09:47.186

the [bleep] already,

tried to call me.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.557
What happened when
I tried to call you?

09:51.624 --> 09:52.758
I didn't answer.

09:52.825 --> 09:53.726
Exactly, why?

09:53.793 --> 09:54.560
Because I didn't see
that you were calling?

09:54.627 --> 09:56.162
Because where were you?

09:56.228 --> 09:57.530
I was having
breakfast with a friend.

09:57.596 --> 09:58.798
With a friend, right.

09:58.864 --> 10:02.468
I leave and see you driving down
the street with this [bleep].

10:02.535 --> 10:03.502
Like you was in your car.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.538
I was driving right next to you.

10:05.604 --> 10:08.741
Yes, I was on the way
to breakfast with my friend

10:08.808 --> 10:10.776
{\an5}and who happens to pull up
right next to me?

10:10.843 --> 10:11.744
{\an5}Drew.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.212
I mean, what are the chances?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.649
I've been avoiding Drew because
I know he hates this dude.

10:16.716 --> 10:17.817
I just didn't want to tell him.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.685
I didn't want to deal with
the arguing back and forth.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.320
So, whatever was [bleep] up and
how it happened, I'm sorry,

10:21.387 --> 10:23.956
but you have been acting really
weird, you have been

10:24.023 --> 10:24.991
acting really distant.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.192
You've just been acting strange.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.194
If I don't answer the phone,
it's okay to go see another

10:28.260 --> 10:29.428
[bleep], pick him up
and go to breakfast?

10:29.495 --> 10:31.630
No, I was going to tell you that
we were going to breakfast,

10:31.697 --> 10:32.598
if he's just a friend.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.000
I didn't even see.

10:34.066 --> 10:34.834
Why are you playing this game?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.102
I'm not playing any game.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.870
I'm not playing any game and I
understand it was [bleep] up and

10:37.937 --> 10:39.372
I understand it hurt you and
I'm sorry, but there was nothing

10:39.438 --> 10:41.140
from it, it was just breakfast.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.141
Really?

10:42.208 --> 10:43.509
It was the same [bleep]
you cheated on me with.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.044
You feel like that's cool?

10:45.111 --> 10:46.679
Like it's just a breakfast.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.914
Let me go [bleep] a bitch
tomorrow and then go

10:48.981 --> 10:50.416
have breakfast with her
a few weeks later.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.118
Let's see how you
feel about that.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.453
I've been dealing with Amanda's
inability to disconnect from

10:54.520 --> 10:56.322
this dude for way too long.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.225
I don't know where she gets it
in her mind to think that it's

10:59.291 --> 11:01.127
okay to have a friendly
breakfast with any dude,

11:01.193 --> 11:02.895
let alone this one.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.830
You dealing with this
[bleep] is not okay with me.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.198
And if you're going to continue
to deal with him, even be his

11:06.265 --> 11:08.401
friend, then I'm cool on you,
I don't need to be with you

11:08.467 --> 11:10.202
because you consistently are
dealing with the

11:10.269 --> 11:11.337
same [bleep], y'all.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.672
The same [bleep].

11:13.739 --> 11:14.640

11:14.707 --> 11:15.574
Do you want to be with him?

11:15.641 --> 11:16.675
Because you can be with him.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.310
I don't need the permission
from you, it's not that,

11:18.377 --> 11:19.478
I don't want the
permission from you.

11:19.545 --> 11:20.713
I want things to work out
with you because I love you.

You gonna have to show
something, I'm not going to

All right, so that's

Teairra is my girl and after her
relationship with Ray J, I know

12:32.318 --> 12:35.087
she knows a thing or two
about being broken hearted.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.090
So, it's time to catch up on my
newly single status and fill her

12:38.157 --> 12:40.759

I have my titties
out tonight because.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.638
Because?

It's been a while
since I've had them out.

you happy, honey.

out because I'm single.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.592
Wait a minute, back it up.

Remember last time I was telling
you that if I find out about him

13:16.395 --> 13:18.063
and Masika I'm
going to be pissed off.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.932
So, what happened?

13:19.999 --> 13:21.867
I popped up at her photoshoot.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.836
She was talking about how she
flew to Vegas more than,

13:23.903 --> 13:25.838
he told me twice.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.673
I said, "Have you
guys been having sex?"

13:27.740 --> 13:29.175
She told me they [bleep].

13:29.241 --> 13:31.510
And you know, he's
still denying it.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.713
We were broken up, like just
being a man and owning up to it,

13:34.780 --> 13:35.614
you know.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.649
Like with Princess,
I told you before.

13:36.715 --> 13:37.850
Like come on, bitch.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.285
He lied to me.

13:39.351 --> 13:40.519
And I just feel like at this
point I just have to move

13:40.586 --> 13:42.454
on with my life.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.323

back and forth with Nikki

13:44.390 --> 13:46.325

13:46.392 --> 13:49.828
But I'm happy that she's learned
the truth and she's moving on.

Kuddos to you, bitch.

13:51.997 --> 13:52.765
You?

13:52.831 --> 13:54.099
What the hell
have you been doing?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.734
I told you I was
going to work with Berg.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.336
Oh, so how did that go?

13:57.403 --> 13:58.370
I walked in.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.206
Do you see this right here?

14:00.272 --> 14:02.474
This ain't got nothing
on what was going on.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.177
Roses, candles, I
wasn't even ready at all.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.446
So, he's never told
you he liked you before?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.181
I still don't think it's that.

14:09.248 --> 14:10.649

In denial about what?

14:11.951 --> 14:13.285
You know he likes you.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.486
He's not going to do all that
extra stuff for someone

14:14.553 --> 14:17.089
he don't want to impress.

14:17.156 --> 14:20.826
You know what, I'm flirtatious
anyway, so that is what it is,

14:20.893 --> 14:23.829

focus on my career.

Berg pushing up on me was a
little left field and right now

14:35.841 --> 14:37.176
I'm just not on that.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.846
I'm totally focused on my music

16:18.811 --> 16:20.245
to [bleep] come over.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.182
I know he's not happy with the
sad, sad, tragic turn of events

16:23.248 --> 16:25.884
that have happened in my life,
however I'm working hard at

16:25.951 --> 16:28.053
my company and at my
music, I have faith that

16:28.120 --> 16:31.357
something huge is
on the horizon.

16:31.423 --> 16:34.827
My main reason on bringing you
here though was we're trying

16:34.893 --> 16:37.162
to build on this own
co-parenting thing.

16:37.229 --> 16:40.399
Is this like a house -- are
you and Amanda going to be

16:40.466 --> 16:42.935
like moving in together?

16:43.001 --> 16:45.237
You know, that was the plan,
but being that we're on a little

16:45.304 --> 16:47.673
break right now, that's
not my focus at this time.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.875
Why a break?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.477
I mean, I just.

16:51.543 --> 16:55.781
That's not a subject I feel like
I have to discuss it with you.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.049
You don't have to discuss it.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.386
I respect your privacy, but I
will say maybe she's not ready

17:00.452 --> 17:05.257
to assume responsibility
for someone else's child.

17:05.324 --> 17:06.525
I get it.

17:06.592 --> 17:10.128
I'm not asking her to assume any
responsibility more than asking

17:10.194 --> 17:13.365
to know that she's
committed to this situation.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.768
I don't like Amanda, so I can't
say I'm sad or surprised to

17:15.834 --> 17:18.137
hear that she and Drew are
having problems.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.772
But I'm going to refrain from
being a mean girl since Drew

17:20.839 --> 17:23.876
and I are trying to make moves
in a positive direction.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.377
And for now, I will
also refrain from,

17:26.444 --> 17:29.481
"I told you so, thought
she was all that.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.516
Sike!"

17:30.582 --> 17:33.352
So, what's going on
with your business thing?

17:33.419 --> 17:37.356
Well, my investor decided
to be a little butt hole.

17:37.423 --> 17:40.426
I'm sitting on a gold mine,
a rocket ship full

17:40.492 --> 17:41.660
of hot [bleep].

17:41.727 --> 17:47.466
Now I've got to find
$130,000 to finish my prototype.

17:47.533 --> 17:51.770
And speaking of which, you
did say if I needed help.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.306
You're asking me for help
with some heated [bleep]?

17:54.373 --> 17:57.509
When I said help, I was
referring to your music career

17:57.576 --> 18:00.612
and you singing and
that whole thing.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.715
You should rather it be hot
[bleep] than me being a little

18:03.782 --> 18:06.885
porn hooker humping
it up for dollars.

18:06.952 --> 18:09.655
This seems a little
ridiculous right now.

18:09.721 --> 18:12.357
It seems a little ridiculous
because you don't understand it.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.792
Three snaps to the money, honey.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.761
Let's get it.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.697
Now, Moniece knows damn well
I'm not about to cut her no type

18:18.764 --> 18:22.100
of check, so I'm not tripping,
but I do know well enough that

18:22.167 --> 18:24.703
this visit has ran its course
and it's time to get the hell up

18:24.770 --> 18:26.939
out of here if it's
going to go left.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.006
What do you feel
about this place?

18:28.073 --> 18:28.640
This area?

18:28.707 --> 18:29.708
I think it's cute.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.577
This school, let's
stick to that right now.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.446
I'm excited about the third
bedroom because if anything ever

18:34.513 --> 18:37.783
happens to me, I know I can come
here and be safe and

18:37.850 --> 18:39.585
snuggle with my muffin.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.953
You might need somewhere else.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.821
Maybe I'll get you
a room with him.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.523
What?

18:44.590 --> 18:50.229
No, you can't
abandon your baby mama.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.697
What if something happened
to me and I was like,

18:51.763 --> 18:53.298
"Oh, my God, Drew."

18:53.365 --> 18:55.033
I'm going to be like,
"Word, you can call your mama."

18:55.100 --> 18:56.301
But I didn't have
a baby with them.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.936
I had a baby with you.

18:58.003 --> 18:59.705
We don't have to do all
that, we can be cool.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.306
We humped the [bleep] up.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.642
We were banging
like two wild animals.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.644

keep it like that.

19:05.711 --> 19:08.947

together, don't run from it.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.048
What is your problem right now?

19:10.115 --> 19:12.417
Don't run from it, baby
daddy, you know you love me.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.521
Stop, stop, you want to
get thrown in the pool?

thrown in the pool?

19:16.588 --> 19:19.191

go down together.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.125

{\an5}So, I've been trying to get to
know Hazel lately and be

20:03.769 --> 20:04.970
{\an5}a good friend to her.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.240
{\an5}In the interim I have completely
neglected my real friend Berg,

20:08.307 --> 20:10.475
{\an5}who I've known way before Hazel.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.078
So, I don't know, I need to take
a few steps back and listen to

20:13.145 --> 20:15.113
Berg's side of things before
I just jump into Hazel's

20:15.180 --> 20:17.282

Hey.

Clearly there is no relationship

20:24.523 --> 20:26.825
bottom line is I miss my friend.

20:26.892 --> 20:27.960
What's new, dawg?

20:28.026 --> 20:29.528
Been hanging out with
your girlfriend, Hazel.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.530
Stop that.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.832
She told me what you
said about the record.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.034
The lyrics were messed up.

20:36.101 --> 20:40.505
She sounded a mess and you
politely dusted her belongings

20:40.572 --> 20:42.608
in her bag all over
Hollywood Boulevard.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.343
I shouldn't have
dumped her purse out.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.612
It was petty and I regret it,
but I don't know

20:46.678 --> 20:47.980
what's going on.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.481
I feel like Martin Lawrence in
a "Thin Line Between

20:49.548 --> 20:50.649
Love and Hate".

20:50.716 --> 20:51.883
[laughter]

20:51.950 --> 20:54.820
I gave her the song like you
give a dog a treat because you

20:54.886 --> 20:56.421
don't want them to
keep bugging you.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.457
That's what kind of
situation it was.

20:58.523 --> 21:02.761
She said that you're calling
Teairra your boo or something?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.596
I knew that would get under
her skin a little bit and deeper

21:04.663 --> 21:08.166
than that, that is my boo.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.569
I spend more time and talk to
her more than I talk to Hazel,

21:10.636 --> 21:11.837
so that's my boo.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.815
You know, roses.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.685

rocking with me, but she's all

21:26.752 --> 21:29.287
about business and I'm not
going to worry about that.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.256
I'm just moving to the next
chick in the pentagon

21:31.323 --> 21:33.525

21:33.592 --> 21:35.861
You're not going to
let her have the record?

21:35.927 --> 21:37.129
What?

21:37.195 --> 21:38.964
That would ruin my credibility
as a songwriter and producer.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.332

21:40.399 --> 21:41.667
She played me the record.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.769
And what were your
thoughts and opinions on that?

21:43.835 --> 21:44.636
I love the track.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.305
I love the hook.

21:47.372 --> 21:51.977
I do feel like Hazel's
verse was a little struggly.

21:52.044 --> 21:56.715
I feel like it was a
direct hit at your situation.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.484
And from what she's telling
me this whole time is

21:59.551 --> 22:00.686
you're leading her own.

22:00.752 --> 22:05.424

Struggly is not the word,

Like, I'm trying to let Hazel
know, I'm not clearing the song.

22:12.764 --> 22:14.166
I haven't cleared you.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.334
There's nothing clear about us.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.537

her come in, you know.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.390

and attack the song if you're

22:41.326 --> 22:43.228
feeling it like that, you
said you was feeling it.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.664

amazing, but I just feel like

22:53.705 --> 22:57.175

33:43.755 --> 33:45.189
{\an5}over our differences, but
what I do know is Moniece

33:45.256 --> 33:46.924
{\an5}is getting on my last nerve.

33:46.991 --> 33:48.359
I didn't get to say everything
I wanted to about the

33:48.426 --> 33:51.429
last meeting, but things are
definitely about to change.

33:51.496 --> 33:52.163
Hello.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.765
Hey, how are you?

33:53.831 --> 33:55.533
All right, how are you?

33:55.600 --> 33:58.369
{\an5}I got a text from whore Amanda
saying she wants to meet up and

33:58.436 --> 34:00.304
{\an5}I don't know what the hell
she could possibly want from me

34:00.371 --> 34:03.107
since she and baby
daddy aren't even together.

34:03.174 --> 34:06.277
So, I'm going to be a nice girl
and I'm going to hear her out so

34:06.344 --> 34:09.480
later on down the line I don't
get blamed for ignoring her.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.016
I called you here today because
I've been hearing that you've

34:13.083 --> 34:15.186
been saying like slick little
comments and house hunting with

34:15.253 --> 34:18.889
Drew, which I think is
completely unacceptable.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.927
So, you feel like me showing up
when he was house hunting

34:22.994 --> 34:24.161
was inappropriate?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.897
I just feel like your comments
like, "Oh, I'm going to move

34:25.963 --> 34:28.466
into this bedroom", are
extremely inappropriate.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.902
I can jokingly say
whatever I want.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.704
He was a man that I was
[bleep] and engaged to.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.072
As a woman you should
understand that it's not okay.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.674
I don't think it's funny
and I don't think it's cute.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.076
And I think that's
something that you should get.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.911
Sweet sister
[bleep] has some nerve.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.581
I had a baby with Drew and I
will talk to him and joke with

34:43.648 --> 34:46.484
him however I so choose.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.518
Besides, when I made one simple
request that Amanda reach out

34:48.585 --> 34:52.190
to me when she was alone with my
son, she couldn't be bothered.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.091
So, why should I give a
flying [bleep] what this

34:54.158 --> 34:55.193
bitch has to say?

34:55.259 --> 34:57.395
I now only care for the
emotional well being

34:57.462 --> 34:58.896
of my child.

34:58.963 --> 35:03.868
I understand from Drew you
have commitment issues

35:03.935 --> 35:07.138
and so my concern is the
in and out, in and out.

35:07.205 --> 35:09.674
When you break up with Drew,
you break up with Cameron.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.075
Me and Drew have done this a
hundred times and taken a break

35:11.142 --> 35:12.410
a hundred thousand times.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.911
Oh, so you've broken up
with Cameron a hundred times.

35:13.978 --> 35:14.846
No.

35:14.912 --> 35:16.013
It's not about.

35:16.080 --> 35:16.881
It is about Cameron.

35:16.948 --> 35:17.748
No, it's not.

35:17.815 --> 35:18.950
It's solely about Cameron.

35:19.016 --> 35:22.186
I feel like you shouldn't be
around Cameron at all until

35:22.253 --> 35:24.789
you're really
ready to be a mother.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.057
That's [bleep].

35:26.123 --> 35:27.391
Moniece, that makes no type of
sense and you're delusional if

35:27.458 --> 35:28.759
you think that's normal.

35:28.826 --> 35:29.861
Don't call me that.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.562
Don't call me [bleep].

35:31.629 --> 35:34.699
What you are going to do is
respect me as Cameron's mother.

35:34.765 --> 35:35.700
No.

35:35.766 --> 35:36.901
If you can't respect me.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.704
If you can't respect me and
me and Drew's relationship.

35:39.770 --> 35:40.938
I don't have to respect you.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.240
I don't have to
respect you then.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.741
Do you take Cameron
to school every day?

35:43.808 --> 35:44.709
Do you take him
dinner every night?

35:44.775 --> 35:45.676
I'm telling you,
don't take me there.

35:45.743 --> 35:46.544
I'm telling you
don't take me there.

35:46.611 --> 35:47.512
Do you make him a
bath every night?

35:47.578 --> 35:48.779
I'm telling you
don't take me there.

35:48.846 --> 35:51.249
When that happens, I'll give you
all the respect in the world.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.085
The fact that I haven't come
across this table and knocked

35:54.151 --> 35:56.287
you clear into
yesteryear, honey,

35:56.354 --> 35:59.657
I done caught the spirit, Jesus.

35:59.724 --> 36:00.625
Will he do it?

36:00.691 --> 36:02.527
Yes, he will.

36:02.593 --> 36:04.896
I think sometimes you can
be a little delusional.

36:04.962 --> 36:06.464
Stop saying that.

36:06.531 --> 36:07.632
I'm not going to stop saying
that because I really,

36:07.698 --> 36:09.000
truly feel.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.368
If you're not going to
stop talking [bleep]

36:10.434 --> 36:11.302
and disrespecting me.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.504
I do feel sometimes
you are delusional.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.573
And I just set that boundary
and said don't call me [bleep].

36:15.640 --> 36:16.507
I didn't call you [bleep],
I said you were

36:16.574 --> 36:17.909
delusional sometimes.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.511
I don't want to hear
anything that's not my name.

Wrinkle-stilskin is skating
on really thin ice with me.

36:23.614 --> 36:26.584
I'm trying to hold it
together because I need answers.

36:26.651 --> 36:29.086
Are you together, or
are you not together?

36:29.153 --> 36:32.523
Drew was telling me, "I was
dating a woman who I don't

36:32.590 --> 36:35.793
feel is ready to
be here forever."

36:35.860 --> 36:39.497
We're working on it and now I'm
ready to deal with it and

36:39.564 --> 36:41.632
I've weighed out all the options
and weighed out your crazy ass

36:41.699 --> 36:43.935
and weighed out Cameron.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.237
I've told you about talking to
me like you've lost your

36:46.304 --> 36:47.305
ragged ass mind.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.639
You're clearly not
understanding, so I need

36:50.608 --> 36:53.077

crazy and delusional, Moniece.

36:53.144 --> 36:53.844
