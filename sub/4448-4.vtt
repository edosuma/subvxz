WANTS TO GO SKINNY‐DIPPING?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.662
‐ IN WHAT ALTERNATE
MEXICAN UNIVERSE

08:57.662 --> 08:59.330
DO DRUG DEALERS
SUGGEST SKINNY‐DIPPING?

08:59.330 --> 09:01.166
‐ PEOPLE ARE INTO WEIRD SH‐‐.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.084
‐ I DON'T THINK YOU WANNA
GO SWIMMING WITH THESE, BABY.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.461
‐ WHAT ABOUT, LIKE,
NAKED TWISTER?

09:04.461 --> 09:05.628
‐ I'M NOT HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.130
‐ COME ON, JAKES!
‐ GET HIM INKED

09:07.130 --> 09:08.590
AND GET DOWNSTAIRS.
‐ JAKES?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.508
JAKES, I LOVE YOU, MAN.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.302
‐ YOU'RE STUPID.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.636
‐ YO.
‐ WHAT?

09:13.636 --> 09:16.056
‐ WE SHOULD DO A CHUPACABRA
ON MY LEFT BUTT CHEEK.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.474
RIGHT?
‐ SHUT UP.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.808
‐ YOU KNOW
WHAT THOSE ARE, RIGHT?

09:18.808 --> 09:27.317
‐ LAY FLAT.
‐ [chuckles]

09:27.317 --> 09:28.693
‐ CHRIST, MAN.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.321
DID A NUMBER ON YOU, HUH?

09:31.321 --> 09:34.199
‐ STAY HERE.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.658
‐ JESUS. LOOK AT HIS EYE.

09:35.658 --> 09:39.370
‐ YEAH, IT'S UGLY,
BUT IT'S GOOD FOR US.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.914
‐ GOOD FOR US HOW?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.665
‐ WELL, BELLO'S BURNING
HIS OWN LIEUTENANTS.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.750
IT MEANS HE'S CONVINCED
WE DIDN'T

09:43.750 --> 09:46.211
SELL HIM OUT TO BOBBY MOI.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.756
COME ON.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.966
FUTURE REFERENCE, MAN,
I LIKE THIS PLACE

09:51.966 --> 09:53.134
MUCH BETTER
THAN YOUR WAREHOUSE.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.928
‐ [chuckles]

09:54.928 --> 09:57.305
YOU AND ME BOTH.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.640
FRISK THEM.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.476
‐ I'LL SAVE YOU 30 SECONDS
AND A BROKEN HAND.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.144
‐ AH.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.437
‐ IS THAT A PROBLEM?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.814
‐ NO.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.899
GIVEN THE INTRODUCTION,

10:07.899 --> 10:10.735
I UNDERSTAND THE WARINESS.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.986
‐ COOL.

10:11.986 --> 10:12.987
SO WHAT'S GOOD HERE?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.572
‐ DON'T SIT.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.825
TODAY I WANT TO SPEAK
TO YOUR FRIEND.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.910
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.454
‐ NOT AT ALL.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.457
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.293
[pats back]

10:27.293 --> 10:30.046
‐ [clears throat]

10:30.046 --> 10:31.589
[exhales]

10:31.589 --> 10:34.759
‐ SO YOU ARE A MARINE.

10:34.759 --> 10:39.430
WHEN I WAS 18,
I JOINED THE NIGERIAN ARMY.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.308
A YEAR LATER,
THE PRESIDENT ABACHA WAS DEAD.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.813
I WAS REWARDED FOR MY SERVICE
WITH EXILE.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.523
‐ SOUNDS LIKE YOU PICKED
THE WRONG SIDE.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.860
‐ AH, I AM THE ONE
SIPPING THE CHAMPAGNE NOW.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.944
[both chuckle]

10:52.944 --> 10:55.905
‐ SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.323
‐ BUSINESS.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.161
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A PIT BULL IN HIS FIRST FIGHT?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.579
‐ I HAD BULLDOGS
GROWING UP.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.997
‐ AH, WELL,
THEN I'LL TELL YOU,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.415
IT'S NOT A PRETTY THING.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.083
THEY HAVE THE TEETH.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.128
THEY HAVE THE MUSCULARITY.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.631
BUT THEY HAVE NOT QUITE YET
LEARNED HOW TO FIGHT.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.885
MY RECRUITS
ARE QUITE SAVAGE,

11:16.885 --> 11:20.221
BUT THEY LACK
THE PRACTICAL SKILL.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.141
‐ YOU WANT ME
TO TEACH THEM TO SHOOT?

11:23.141 --> 11:26.477
‐ THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE
THEIR WQBs.

11:26.477 --> 11:33.151
‐ THEIR WHAT?
WHAT'S WQB?

11:33.151 --> 11:34.819
‐ WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO PUT A BULLET

11:34.819 --> 11:36.404
IN YOUR STOMACH?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.156
‐ THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.492
‐ SEE, LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.828
HOW IS IT AS A MARINE
WHO SERVED,

11:43.828 --> 11:50.126
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A WQB IS?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.587
‐ YOU MEAN A PIZZA BOX?

11:52.587 --> 11:54.631
IT'S THE LOWEST LEVEL
OF MARKSMANSHIP.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.759
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE
SAY "WQB"

11:57.759 --> 11:59.302
SINCE FIRST WEEK OF BOOT.

11:59.302 --> 12:04.974
‐ UH‐HUH.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.643
THEY CALL IT A PIZZA BOX?

12:06.643 --> 12:08.228
‐ IT'S A SQUARE.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.437
THE NAME'S ASININE,

12:09.437 --> 12:14.609
BUT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
CALL IT.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.570
‐ MY BOYS SHOULD
HAVE THEIR PIZZA BOXES.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.322
IT PAYS QUITE WELL.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.200
‐ IF I'M IN, SHOULD I EXPECT
TO HAVE A GUN

12:22.200 --> 12:23.743
POINTED AT ME
EVERY TIME WE MEET?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.203
‐ [chuckles]

12:25.203 --> 12:27.372
I PRAY THAT
THIS IS THE LAST TIME.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.332
[both laugh]

12:29.332 --> 12:31.376
‐ I'M IN.
‐ GOOD.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.899
EDWARD WILL
GET YOU THE DETAILS.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.276
[footsteps approaching]

12:56.276 --> 12:57.944
‐ HEY, PAULIE.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.320
WHAT'S THE WORD?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.488
‐ GETTIN' A DRINK.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.533
‐ RUM'S USUALLY
YOUR MORNING DRINK.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.368
‐ YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

13:05.368 --> 13:07.328
THE DOG BITES AT ALL HOURS.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.663
‐ WHAT'S UP?

13:08.663 --> 13:09.914
YOU WANNA TALK OR WHAT?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.457
‐ NO. WOULD YOU
LIKE A DRINK?

13:11.457 --> 13:12.834
‐ I'M GOOD.
WHERE'S MIKE?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.585
‐ MIKE IS MAKING A DEAL
WITH BELLO.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.462
‐ YOUR BELLO?
‐ MM‐HMM.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.715
FIRST REAL MEET‐AND‐GREET
WITH A GUY

13:18.715 --> 13:20.717
I'VE BEEN CHASING
FOR THREE MONTHS‐‐

13:20.717 --> 13:22.343
‐ AND THE KID
SNAKES IT FROM YOU.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.804
‐ WELL, I MEAN, HE DIDN'T
REALLY SNAKE IT FROM ME.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.472
BELLO JUST WANTS HIM
TO PLAY DRILL SERGEANT

13:26.472 --> 13:28.433
WITH HIS GREENHORNS.
‐ OH, GOOD FOR MIKE.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.393
‐ THE KID WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAVE TO CARRY IT ON HIS OWN.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.811
‐ OH, MY GOD.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.271
HONEY, IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED
ABOUT HIM,

13:33.271 --> 13:34.355
WHY AREN'T YOU
SITTING AT COMMAND?

13:34.355 --> 13:37.317
‐ THERE'S A TEAM ON HIM.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.985
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.278
‐ WHAT IS MY PROBLEM,
CHARLIE?

13:40.278 --> 13:42.155
‐ YOU GOT
QUARTERBACK SYNDROME.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.990
YOU DON'T THINK
ANY OF US CAN WIN

13:43.990 --> 13:45.533
UNLESS YOU'RE
LEADING THE CHARGE.

13:45.533 --> 13:49.037
‐ WELL, I MEAN, TOM BRADY
HAS QUARTERBACK SYNDROME.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.872
AND HE ALSO HAS
THREE CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.749
‐ YEAH, AND ELI'S GOT TWO
AND HE'S FOUR YEARS YOUNGER.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.417
YOU PATS FANS MAKE ME SICK.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.044
‐ UH, YOU WERE
MAKING A POINT I THINK?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.879
‐ YEAH, OKAY.
MIKE'S CLOSER TO BELLO

13:57.879 --> 13:59.213
THAN ANYONE'S EVER BEEN,
RIGHT?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.215
‐ YEAH.
‐ OKAY.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.258
SO WHAT ARE YOU
MORE INTERESTED IN,

14:02.258 --> 14:03.718
THE YARDS OR THE RING?

14:03.718 --> 14:06.512
COME ON.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.640
‐ [sighs]

14:09.640 --> 14:10.892
‐ YO, SLOW DOWN, BRO.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.226
‐ WE'RE ALREADY LATE, MAN.
‐ SO WHAT?

14:12.226 --> 14:14.312
‐ SO WHAT IS THIS AIN'T
A COSTUME PARTY, JOHNNY.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.064
IT'S A DRUG BUY.
‐ [scoffs]

14:16.064 --> 14:17.732
IT'S A WEED BUY.
SO IT'S BASICALLY LEGAL, RIGHT?

14:17.732 --> 14:19.150
‐ YEAH, WELL,
UNTIL IT'S LITERALLY LEGAL,

14:19.150 --> 14:21.152
WE DO OUR JOB.
‐ ALL RIGHT, LANCELOT.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.237
YOU SOUND LIKE MIKE NOW, BRO.
‐ HEY, MAN.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.990
BEFORE I MET HER,
ASHIKA PEARL

14:25.990 --> 14:28.159
LIT A CROP ON FIRE
UP IN HUMBOLDT.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.495
SHE WATCHED SIX RIVAL GROWERS
BURN TO DEATH.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.705
SO PLEASE EXCUSE ME
IF I TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.416
‐ ALL RIGHT,
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.709
YO, "ASHIKA"?
WHAT IS THAT?

14:36.709 --> 14:37.960
‐ INDIAN.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.670
‐ INDIAN LIKE RAIN DANCE
OR BELLY DANCE?

14:39.670 --> 14:40.838
‐ BELLY DANCE.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.340
‐ BUT SHE'S WHITE THOUGH,
RIGHT?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.383
‐ YEAH. SHE FOUND BUDDHA,
DECIDED TO CHANGE HER NAME.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.843
‐ YO, THAT'S
A NATION OF ISLAM THING,

14:45.843 --> 14:47.637
CHANGING YOUR NAME.
‐ SHE'S CRAZY, ALL RIGHT?

14:47.637 --> 14:49.180
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
‐ IS SHE HOT THOUGH?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.723
TELL ME THE TRUTH.
‐ YEAH, I GUESS.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.391
YO, JOHNNY,
CAN WE JUST DO THIS FAST?

14:52.391 --> 14:54.685
SET A DEAL, AGREE TO TERMS,
AND MAKE THE BUST.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.521
I DON'T WANNA BE HERE
LONGER THAN I HAVE TO.

14:56.521 --> 14:57.688
‐ YOU GOT IT, BRO.
YES, SIR.

14:57.688 --> 15:04.445
‐ DUDE, DON'T DO THAT SH‐‐.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.822
‐ YOU'RE LATE.
‐ I KNOW.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.532
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T FIND MY KEY‐‐

15:07.532 --> 15:09.826
‐ DALE JACOBS, AHH.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.661
YOU BEAUTIFUL
SON OF A BITCH.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.995
‐ ALL RIGHT.
‐ MM.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.789
MWAH.
‐ OKAY.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.166
‐ TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE
EUROPEAN, WILL YA?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.836
‐ ALL RIGHT.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.504
‐ ANYWAY,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.005
‐ YEAH. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.341
SO THIS IS THE GUY
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.136
ASHIKA, JT.
‐ JT, HUH?

15:28.136 --> 15:29.554
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

15:29.554 --> 15:31.597
‐ WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT MY STORY IS?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.474
‐ JUST CHILL, MAN, OKAY?
SHE'S‐‐

15:33.474 --> 15:34.684
‐ I AIN'T GOT
NO STORY, B.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.310
DALE SAYS YOU COULD
HOOK ME UP, HERE I AM.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.312
‐ IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?
‐ YEAH, I, UM‐‐

15:38.312 --> 15:40.565
I HEARD YOU WERE
BACK IN BUSINESS.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.483
‐ ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THINGS.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.652
‐ [scoffs] OTHER SIDE
WHERE THE MONEY'S AT.

15:44.652 --> 15:48.322
‐ SWEETHEART, I DON'T NEED
VOCATIONAL ADVICE

15:48.322 --> 15:50.074
FROM SOME LOW‐LEVEL BANGER
SELLING DITCH WEED

15:50.074 --> 15:51.284
OUT OF HIS EL CAMINO.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.869
‐ OH, YEAH?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.704
I DON'T NEED NO LIP
FROM SOME UPPITY '60s

15:54.704 --> 15:56.706
THROWBACK YOGA MAT GRINGA
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT‐‐

15:56.706 --> 15:58.666
‐ HEY!
YO, CHILL, ALL RIGHT?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.586
‐ SHE SHOW ME SOME RESPECT,
I'LL CHILL.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.630
I DON'T NEED THIS SH‐‐, MAN.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.757
‐ YOU USED TO KEEP
BETTER COMPANY.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.968
‐ I SWEAR, I DID NOT KNOW

16:08.968 --> 16:10.553
HE WAS GONNA
ACT UP LIKE THAT.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.764
‐ YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
ALWAYS A GOOD ONE.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.349
AND I TRUST YOU,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

16:15.349 --> 16:18.686
ABOUT YOUR AMIGO OVER THERE.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.439
‐ NO, I GET IT.
JUST, UH, YOU KNOW,

16:21.439 --> 16:22.815
GIVE HIM ANOTHER SHOT,
ALL RIGHT?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.817
HE'LL BEHAVE, MY WORD.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.694
‐ ALL RIGHT.
COME OUT TO THE FARM TOMORROW,

16:26.694 --> 16:29.780
AND MAYBE
I'LL HELP YOU OUT.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.073
‐ OKAY.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.491
‐ MAYBE.

16:32.491 --> 16:38.706
‐ IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.625
‐ WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.335
‐ WHAT WAS WHAT?
‐ "WHAT WAS WHAT"?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.128
YOU ALMOST BLEW MY CASE.
‐ I DIDN'T BLOW NOTHING.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.630
I JUST I COULD
HELP YOU GUYS OUT BY‐‐

16:45.630 --> 16:47.089
‐ NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO THINK.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.133
YOU ARE ENLISTED TO FACILITATE
A D. E. A. INVESTIGATION...

16:49.133 --> 16:51.594
‐ COME ON NOW.
‐ NOTHING MORE.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.179
‐ WHEN REPORTS GOT FBI
UP IN THE HEADER,

16:53.179 --> 16:54.555
THEN YOU CAN FRONT
LIKE A STREET THUG.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.973
‐ HOLD UP, HOLD UP.
YOU GUYS SEE THIS, RIGHT?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.142
I CAN'T BE LONGO AND GET PUNKED
BY SOME HIPPIE CHICK.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.144
‐ YOU'RE A FEDERAL AGENT
WITH A HENNA TATTOO.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.896
‐ OKAY, OKAY, LOOK.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.940
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.107
WE'LL GO
TO THE FARM TOMORROW.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.484
WE'LL GET EYES
ON THE OVERGROWTH, OKAY?

17:06.484 --> 17:08.653
‐ YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.820
‐ SORRY, BABY.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.822
‐ DON'T EVEN. DON'T EVEN.

17:11.822 --> 17:22.750
‐ [chuckles]

17:22.750 --> 17:23.876
‐ HEY, HEY.
[knocks]

17:23.876 --> 17:25.795

37:09.102 --> 37:10.478
‐ WE ARE THE INQUISITION.
‐ OKAY.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.397
CAN WE GET RIGHT TO
THE "WITHOUT FURTHER ADO" PART?

37:12.397 --> 37:16.735
‐ WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
LET'S ENJOY SAUCE NIGHT, KIDS.

37:16.735 --> 37:20.488
[overlapping chatter]

37:20.488 --> 37:22.782
‐ HEY, UH, IS IT A COINCIDENCE
THAT SAUCE NIGHT

37:22.782 --> 37:25.618
HAPPENS TO FALL ON THE WEEKEND
THAT I HAVE THE DISHES?

37:25.618 --> 37:27.454
‐ NOBODY HERE'S
THAT DEVIOUS, MIKE.

37:27.454 --> 37:29.080
‐ I HAVE A DATE AFTER THIS.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.373
‐ YEAH?

37:30.373 --> 37:31.958
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.209
THAT LITTLE
EAST COAST NUMBER, HUH?

37:33.209 --> 37:34.627
‐ YEAH.
‐ YEAH.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.337
I'M SURE THE DISHES
WILL BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.298
‐ YOU SURE?

37:38.298 --> 37:39.716
‐ AM I SURE THE DISHES
WILL BE HERE

37:39.716 --> 37:40.967
WHEN YOU GET BACK?
YEAH.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.721
‐ NO, I MEAN, THANKS.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.514
[phone chimes]

37:46.514 --> 37:50.018
[indistinct chatter]

37:50.018 --> 37:52.103
BRIGGS?
‐ YEAH?

37:52.103 --> 37:54.898
‐ IT'S BELLO.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.483
WE HAVE TO GO, DON'T WE?

37:56.483 --> 37:58.485
‐ YEP, DISHES CAN WAIT.
BELLO CAN'T.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.653
HEY, GUYS, WE GOTTA RUN.
WE GOT BUSINESS, OKAY?

38:00.653 --> 38:02.280
‐ WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
‐ WHAT?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.573
‐ ALL RIGHT, MAN.
‐ [speaking Spanish]

38:03.573 --> 38:10.288
‐ ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA EAT YOUR FOOD.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.500
‐ A LITTLE LATE
TO BE GETTING STARTED.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.960
‐ NEVER HAD TO FIRE YOUR WEAPON
IN THE EVENING?

38:15.960 --> 38:19.506
‐ YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
NOWHERE NEAR THAT LESSON YET.

38:19.506 --> 38:25.804
‐ TODAY I TEACH THE LESSONS.

38:25.804 --> 38:31.643
BRING HIM OUT.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.355
THEY SAY POWER
IS A MATTER OF PERCEPTION.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.273
I'VE ALWAYS DISAGREED
WITH THAT.

38:37.273 --> 38:41.277
WE DON'T PERCEIVE POWER.
WE REMEMBER IT.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.488
YOU UNDERSTAND?

38:43.488 --> 38:46.115
MAYBE YOU DON'T.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.868
YOU CAN'T THREATEN
THE HAND

38:48.868 --> 38:51.579
IF YOU HAVEN'T
REDDENED THE FACE.

38:51.579 --> 38:55.083
‐ HE IS WORKING
WITH THE FEDS, BOSS.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.626
I FOLLOWED HIM.

38:56.626 --> 38:59.295
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
THEY BRING ME IN.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.297
‐ TELL ME ABOUT THE FEDS.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.967
‐ THEY DRAG ME
OUT OF MY FLAT

39:03.967 --> 39:09.138
AND THEN MADE UP A LIE
I WAS WORKING WITH BOBBY MOI.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.890
‐ BUT YOU WEREN'T WORKING
WITH BOBBY MOI,

39:10.890 --> 39:12.642
WERE YOU, EDDIE?
‐ OF COURSE NOT, BOSS.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.477
OF COURSE NOT.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.354
‐ THE FEDS, THEY MADE UP
ALL THOSE LIES ABOUT YOU.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.439
‐ LIES, ALL LIES.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.817
‐ YEAH. AND THEN
YOU CALLED YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.193
‐ YES.

39:22.193 --> 39:26.698
‐ AND TOLD HER YOU WERE
GOING TO ARIZONA.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.993
‐ I DID NOT
TELL THEM ANYTHING.

39:29.993 --> 39:40.712
‐ YOU WERE ON THE BUS,
EDWARD!

39:40.712 --> 39:45.425
ARE YOU WORKING
WITH THE FBI?

39:45.425 --> 39:47.385
‐ NO.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.929
‐ I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.474
HE IS NOBODY.

39:53.474 --> 39:58.688
HE IS NO ONE.

39:58.688 --> 40:10.742
‐ GIVE ME YOUR GUN, MICHAEL.

40:10.742 --> 40:17.081
LET HIM GO.

40:17.081 --> 40:21.127
‐ I AM GOING
TO TAKE YOUR EYE,

40:21.127 --> 40:23.546
YOU PIECE OF TRASH.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.798
‐ THIS IS GOING TO END

40:25.798 --> 40:59.958
ONE OF TWO WAYS.

40:59.958 --> 41:08.841
‐ DON'T!

41:08.841 --> 41:10.259
‐ GO! GO NOW!

41:10.259 --> 41:11.803
‐ [exhales]

41:11.803 --> 41:13.262
OH, MY GOD.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.305
‐ WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.433
THAT'S WARREN.

41:17.433 --> 41:45.878
‐ NOW HE HAS HIS PIZZA BOX.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.130
‐ HI.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.008
HI THERE, STRANGER.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.677
‐ I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
‐ NO SWEAT.

41:52.677 --> 41:56.264
I WAS OVERDUE
FOR SOME SOLO BOOZING.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.849
HOW WAS THE SAUCE?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.392
‐ WHAT?

41:59.392 --> 42:00.727
‐ YOUR THING?

42:00.727 --> 42:03.771
YOU DIDN'T GO?

42:03.771 --> 42:08.901
‐ I, UM...

42:08.901 --> 42:10.403
[exhales]

42:10.403 --> 42:14.615
‐ HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

42:14.615 --> 42:16.492
‐ THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.910
‐ OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU HURT?

42:17.910 --> 42:20.830
‐ NO. I SAW IT.

42:20.830 --> 42:24.250
‐ DID THE PERSON‐‐
‐ YEAH.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.085
‐ CHRIST.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.795
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
GO HOME.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.089
‐ WE HAVE A DATE.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.759
‐ MIKE, GO.

42:32.759 --> 42:40.349
COME ON, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA BE GOOD COMPANY ANYWAY.

42:40.349 --> 42:41.976
‐ THANK YOU.

42:41.976 --> 43:22.141
‐ [softly] OF COURSE.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.143
‐ [sighs]

43:24.143 --> 43:26.687
YOU WANT A HAND WITH THOSE?
‐ NO.

43:26.687 --> 43:32.068
I THINK I ACTUALLY
WANNA BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

43:32.068 --> 43:36.739
‐ I SEE
THEY LEFT YOU A PLATE.

43:36.739 --> 43:39.367
‐ I THOUGHT
THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS.

43:39.367 --> 43:45.540
‐ AH. CHARLIE LIKES YOU.

43:45.540 --> 43:49.043
‐ HEY, BRIGGS.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.213
WHY DON'T YOU EAT IT?
I DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE.

43:52.213 --> 43:55.049
‐ NO, MAN,
JUST HEAT IT UP TOMORROW.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.760
‐ NO, YOU MISSED
SAUCE NIGHT TOO.

43:57.760 --> 44:01.597
‐ YEAH.

44:01.597 --> 44:11.858
IT'S JUST SAUCE, MIKE.
