29:46.086 --> 29:47.435
Principal dimly's
coming through.

29:47.438 --> 29:48.336
Uh-oh.

29:48.338 --> 29:49.870
Oh, hi, daddy.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.938
Looky.

29:52.807 --> 29:55.274
I want to know
who did this,

29:55.276 --> 29:56.987
or I'm going to--

29:56.988 --> 29:58.699
[whispering] Pass this over
to vice principal sludge.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.411
I'm going to pass this over
to vice principal sludge.

30:00.414 --> 30:01.413
Rollo, you take over.

30:01.415 --> 30:02.714
It's the 4 girls

30:02.716 --> 30:05.750
lying next to
the statue. Hello.

30:06.085 --> 30:10.153
Rollo: You, you,
you, and you,

30:10.155 --> 30:11.988

30:14.025 --> 30:15.157
You started it, clumsy.

30:15.159 --> 30:18.160
I tripped. Excuse me,
princess perfect.

30:18.162 --> 30:19.961
That is so like you.

30:19.963 --> 30:21.963
You've always been
the queen of denial.

30:21.965 --> 30:23.181
Do you know what?

30:23.182 --> 30:24.398
Neither one of you ever
thinks anything through.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.199
It's always me having
to pick up the pieces.

30:26.201 --> 30:29.168
That's interesting.
We haven't talked in 2 years,

30:29.170 --> 30:31.770
ever since you dumped us
to be queen of the dorks.

30:31.772 --> 30:34.139
Me? You haven't
spoken to any of us

I didn't stop talkin' to you.
You stopped talkin' to me.

30:42.147 --> 30:43.373
Really?

30:43.374 --> 30:44.600
What are you
talking about, Sasha?

30:44.601 --> 30:45.827
At least we don't
buy our friends

30:45.828 --> 30:47.054
with our daddy's
bank account.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.281
Only because
you don't have a dad

30:48.286 --> 30:49.418
or a bank account.

30:49.420 --> 30:51.920
Stop it!

All of you,
just stop it.

31:00.964 --> 31:04.365
I can't believe
you said that to cloe.

31:04.367 --> 31:06.533
That's ok.

31:06.535 --> 31:09.302
No, it's not.

31:09.304 --> 31:11.170
When your parents
got divorced,

31:11.172 --> 31:12.471
cloe and her mom
were totally there

31:12.473 --> 31:16.474
for you. Don't
forget that, Sasha.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.010
Cloe, I'm sorry.

31:20.012 --> 31:23.179
I can't believe
I said that.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.248
What happened to us?

31:26.250 --> 31:27.916
It's ok.
We were a team.

31:27.918 --> 31:29.384
We always had
each others' backs.

31:29.386 --> 31:32.019
Seriously, like when
you canceled your ski trip

31:32.021 --> 31:33.653
to help cloe
study for finals.

31:33.655 --> 31:35.554
That's what friends do.

31:35.556 --> 31:36.988
And what about you, yas?

31:36.990 --> 31:39.023
Remember you completely
crushed those girls

31:39.025 --> 31:42.292
that used to slam jade
before she grew into her ears.

31:42.294 --> 31:45.261
Well, she would have
done the same for me.

31:45.263 --> 31:46.161
Big deal.

31:46.163 --> 31:47.495
It is a big deal.

31:47.497 --> 31:50.898
Friendship
is a big deal.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.434
Why aren't we
friends anymore?

31:54.436 --> 31:55.601
I can't even remember.

31:55.603 --> 31:59.304
It's the cliques.
We're all in them.

31:59.306 --> 32:01.439
That's just
how high school works.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.973
Sasha,
you're a cheerleader,

32:02.975 --> 32:04.124
cloe's a jock,

32:04.125 --> 32:05.274
and, jade,
you spend your time

32:05.277 --> 32:07.543
between the science
and home ec geeks.

32:07.545 --> 32:09.511
They're not geeks.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.646
They're really
interesting people.

32:11.648 --> 32:14.015
Yeah, but I would
never know that,

32:14.017 --> 32:16.484
because I'm not
in your clique.

32:16.986 --> 32:19.453
So what do we do?

32:19.455 --> 32:21.021
We have to
take control

32:21.023 --> 32:23.390
of our lives,
of our friendships.

32:23.392 --> 32:24.958
It's our own fault.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.193
We can be friends
with each other

32:27.195 --> 32:29.495
and do our
own thing, right?

32:29.497 --> 32:31.363
Ok.

32:31.365 --> 32:33.749
How?

32:33.750 --> 32:36.134
We be ourselves,
just like we used to be.

32:36.136 --> 32:38.536
I miss my girls.

32:38.538 --> 32:39.537

32:59.253 --> 33:00.952
I can't believe them.

33:00.954 --> 33:02.520
This is all your fault,
Cameron, because if you

33:02.522 --> 33:04.722
hadn't walked over and
talked to that soccer joke,

33:04.724 --> 33:06.390
I wouldn't have had
to take action,

33:06.391 --> 33:08.057
and then daddy's bust
would not have been broken,

33:08.060 --> 33:09.592
and those bimbettes
wouldn't be in detention

33:09.594 --> 33:12.628
and back together, creating
anarchy in my kingdom.

33:12.630 --> 33:14.529

Not that good.

1:06:50.079 --> 1:06:52.046
You looked great
on the big screen.

1:06:52.048 --> 1:06:54.415
Oh, don't remind me.

1:06:54.417 --> 1:06:55.616
So humiliating.

1:06:55.618 --> 1:06:58.318
Yeah, don't let it
get to you.

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:00.186
Consider the source.

1:07:07.361 --> 1:07:09.728
[Scoffs] Excuse me.
Yasmin, get back to work.

1:07:09.730 --> 1:07:12.330
That is not what
I am paying you for.

1:07:12.332 --> 1:07:15.333
No fraternizing
with my guests.

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:19.003
Meredith: Oh, you have
got to be kidding me.

1:07:19.005 --> 1:07:21.505
Shoo. Go, go, go, go.

1:07:24.543 --> 1:07:25.575
Excuse me.
Aah!

1:07:25.577 --> 1:07:28.477
[Whistles] Jumbo,
come here, boy.

1:07:28.479 --> 1:07:30.245
Go. Go, jumbo, go.

1:07:30.247 --> 1:07:31.346
[Trumpets]

1:07:31.348 --> 1:07:33.081
Oh, my gosh.

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:36.317
Well, if isn't cloe,
the klutzy clown.

1:07:36.319 --> 1:07:38.485
You're fired.
Now clean up

1:07:38.487 --> 1:07:40.253
this disgusting mess
before my guests see it.

1:07:40.255 --> 1:07:43.222
Cameron, what are you doing?
Get up.

1:07:43.224 --> 1:07:44.690
Cameron.

1:07:45.192 --> 1:07:50.395
Cameron. Cameron,
get me a drink.

1:07:51.231 --> 1:07:54.398
Get your own drink.

1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:55.665
What?

1:07:55.667 --> 1:07:57.066
Cameron!

1:07:57.068 --> 1:07:59.268
[Trumpets]

1:07:59.470 --> 1:08:02.237
Thanks a lot, jumbo.

1:08:02.239 --> 1:08:03.571
Whaah!
Whoa!

1:08:03.573 --> 1:08:05.639
[Guests gasp]

1:08:09.111 --> 1:08:11.311
Ohh! Aah!

1:08:11.313 --> 1:08:14.446
[Laughter]

1:08:17.117 --> 1:08:18.416
What are you looking at?

1:08:18.418 --> 1:08:21.118
Stop it. Stop it!

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:22.836
[Silence]

1:08:22.837 --> 1:08:24.553
This is my mtv
<i> super sweet 16</i> party.

1:08:24.556 --> 1:08:28.558
Everybody go back to your
assigned tables immediately!

1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:30.626
Aah!
Whoa!

1:08:30.628 --> 1:08:34.028
[Laughter]

1:08:35.197 --> 1:08:36.529
Thank you.

1:08:36.531 --> 1:08:39.265
[Trumpets]

1:08:39.267 --> 1:08:40.466
Aah!

1:08:40.468 --> 1:08:42.534
[Laughter]

1:08:44.504 --> 1:08:46.737
[Grunts]

1:08:46.739 --> 1:08:48.405
Meredith,
are you ok?

1:08:48.407 --> 1:08:50.073
Do you need
a hand?

1:08:50.075 --> 1:08:51.774
I--I can get you
a towel.

1:08:51.776 --> 1:08:53.576
I know cpr.

1:08:53.577 --> 1:08:55.377
Look at me! You guys
have ruined everything!

1:08:55.379 --> 1:08:57.345
There was gonna be a cake

1:08:57.347 --> 1:09:00.748
and dancing and
an amazing goody bag.

1:09:00.750 --> 1:09:03.083
But now the party's over.

1:09:03.085 --> 1:09:05.718
You've ruined it
for everyone!

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:07.586
You--you...

1:09:07.588 --> 1:09:09.254
Brats!

1:09:09.256 --> 1:09:11.756
Hi, mtv. This is
the best party

1:09:11.758 --> 1:09:15.559
I have ever been to
in my whole life!

1:09:15.561 --> 1:09:17.093
Happy Birthday,
Meredith.

1:09:17.095 --> 1:09:18.794
[Elephant trumpets]

1:09:22.366 --> 1:09:25.433
Yasmin: Well, she's
brought back the cliques.

1:09:25.435 --> 1:09:28.469
Cloe: Ok. So what
do we do now?

1:09:28.471 --> 1:09:29.369
Um, Sasha.

1:09:29.371 --> 1:09:30.954
Hey, Bethany.

1:09:30.955 --> 1:09:32.538
So, uh,
we've been talking,

1:09:32.540 --> 1:09:34.139
and, um, you're
a really great cheerleader,

1:09:34.141 --> 1:09:37.242
and--and we really want you
to be a part of the team,

1:09:37.244 --> 1:09:39.844
but if--if you don't
wanna hang out with us,

1:09:39.846 --> 1:09:41.791
then maybe you don't have

1:09:41.792 --> 1:09:43.737
the right kind of school spirit
for the job.

1:09:43.738 --> 1:09:45.683
So you're saying if I'm
not a part of your clique,

1:09:45.685 --> 1:09:47.551
I'm off the squad?

1:09:47.553 --> 1:09:50.153
Think about it.

1:09:53.491 --> 1:09:54.991
Hey.

1:09:54.992 --> 1:09:56.492
You either need to spend
more time with us,

1:09:56.494 --> 1:09:58.727
or we need to cut you
from the roster.

1:09:58.729 --> 1:10:02.163
Dexter, don't be that guy.

1:10:02.165 --> 1:10:05.166
I'm afraid that's
not up to me.

1:10:05.835 --> 1:10:09.670
We had a real
chemistry, jade.

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:12.672
I'm not doing it.

1:10:12.674 --> 1:10:14.306
Come on, yas.
Get over it.

1:10:14.308 --> 1:10:16.541
Jade: The only way to get
everyone back together

1:10:16.543 --> 1:10:17.975
is to win the talent show.

1:10:17.977 --> 1:10:20.194
Meredith wins
every year.

1:10:20.195 --> 1:10:22.412
You're the only one that
can break her streak.

1:10:22.414 --> 1:10:23.897
Maybe so,

1:10:23.898 --> 1:10:25.381
but I'm still
not doing it.

1:10:25.383 --> 1:10:27.282
Next subject,
please.

1:10:27.284 --> 1:10:29.317
A chicken.
[Clucking]

1:10:29.319 --> 1:10:32.486
Fine. That's me,
<i> El pollo</i> yasmin.

1:10:32.488 --> 1:10:34.588
Look, if you sing,
I'll spin.

1:10:34.590 --> 1:10:35.989
Really?
Yeah.

1:10:35.991 --> 1:10:37.390
No.

1:10:37.391 --> 1:10:38.790
Come on.
We'll all help you.

1:10:38.793 --> 1:10:40.259
You'll sing,
I'll choreograph,

1:10:40.261 --> 1:10:41.426
cloe'll splash
the background

1:10:41.428 --> 1:10:43.561
with her video bling,
and jade will--

1:10:43.563 --> 1:10:45.996
what, add numbers
faster than anyone?

1:10:45.998 --> 1:10:47.831
2,147.
3,268.

1:10:47.833 --> 1:10:49.799
5,415. Big whoop.

1:10:49.801 --> 1:10:51.300
Hello, fashion diva.

1:10:51.302 --> 1:10:52.534
We're gonna
need costumes.

1:10:52.536 --> 1:10:53.985
Now you're talkin', sister.

1:10:53.986 --> 1:10:55.435
And we're gonna need
backup singers, too.

1:10:55.438 --> 1:10:56.604
And dancers!

1:10:56.605 --> 1:10:57.771
Why stop there?
We should get everyone

1:10:57.772 --> 1:10:58.938
who Meredith shot down
to perform with us.

1:10:58.941 --> 1:11:00.640
Perfect! Then you
don't need me.

1:11:00.642 --> 1:11:02.642
[Sighs] Ok,
how 'bout this?

1:11:02.644 --> 1:11:04.644
The winner gets
a scholarship.

1:11:04.646 --> 1:11:07.913
Know anyone who
might need that?

1:11:07.915 --> 1:11:10.382
Cloe.

1:11:10.917 --> 1:11:12.850
[Sighs] Ok, fine.

1:11:12.852 --> 1:11:13.717
[Squeals]

1:11:13.719 --> 1:11:15.351
But only for cloe.

1:11:15.353 --> 1:11:16.819
But I still can't do it.

1:11:16.821 --> 1:11:18.320
All three: Why?!

1:11:18.322 --> 1:11:21.890
Because we don't
have a name.

1:11:21.892 --> 1:11:23.324
Well, well, well,

1:11:23.326 --> 1:11:25.826
if it isn't
the "brats."

1:11:25.828 --> 1:11:26.827
Heh heh.

1:11:26.829 --> 1:11:27.661
Brats.

1:11:27.663 --> 1:11:29.429
Cloe, you're a genius.

1:11:29.431 --> 1:11:30.830
I am?

1:11:30.832 --> 1:11:31.797
All three: Brats!

1:11:31.799 --> 1:11:33.865
Yeah!
[Laughter]

1:11:33.867 --> 1:11:37.969
Daechelle: ¶ ooh, yeah ¶

some great images

1:12:05.027 --> 1:12:07.627
for the talent show that
I took of the mimes.

1:12:07.629 --> 1:12:09.428
¶ Stand your ground,

1:12:16.452 --> 1:12:18.469
¶ Remember saints and
heroes gone before ¶

1:12:18.471 --> 1:12:20.637
what do you think?

1:12:20.639 --> 1:12:22.339
That looks good.

1:12:22.340 --> 1:12:24.040
¶ In your demon's eyes ¶

1:12:24.042 --> 1:12:27.943

1:12:31.047 --> 1:12:32.079
[Groans in pain]

1:12:32.081 --> 1:12:33.980
Ahh!
You're in.

1:12:33.982 --> 1:12:35.514
Sasha: 5, 6, 7...

1:12:35.516 --> 1:12:36.982
Stop!
You're killing us.

1:12:36.984 --> 1:12:38.984
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California...

1:12:38.986 --> 1:12:40.051
Boring.

1:12:40.053 --> 1:12:42.820
¶ Be fearless ¶

1:12:42.822 --> 1:12:44.855

Horrible.
You're in.

1:12:46.992 --> 1:12:50.893
¶ And know that

1:12:53.831 --> 1:12:55.964
¶ Nothin' is impossible... ¶

1:12:55.966 --> 1:12:57.565

1:13:16.783 --> 1:13:17.882
hey, sweetheart.

1:13:17.884 --> 1:13:19.934
Hi, dad.

1:13:19.935 --> 1:13:21.985
Uh, aren't you supposed
to be at mom's tonight?

1:13:21.988 --> 1:13:23.504
[Gasps] Oh, dad,

1:13:23.505 --> 1:13:25.021
I'm so exhausted,
I completely forgot.

1:13:25.024 --> 1:13:26.723
You know what?
You go on to bed.

1:13:26.725 --> 1:13:27.824
I'll call mom.

1:13:27.825 --> 1:13:28.924
And I just wanna
tell you somethin'.

1:13:28.927 --> 1:13:30.726
I'm really proud of you.

1:13:30.728 --> 1:13:31.893
You are?

1:13:31.895 --> 1:13:33.144
Yeah.

1:13:33.145 --> 1:13:34.394
You and your friends
have put aside

1:13:34.397 --> 1:13:37.464
all your differences
and made it work.

1:13:38.033 --> 1:13:40.467
Thanks, dad.

1:13:40.468 --> 1:13:42.902
Maybe one day, you and mom
will do the same thing.

1:13:42.904 --> 1:13:46.071
Yeah. Maybe.

1:13:49.776 --> 1:13:51.742
Meredith: Bratz?

1:13:51.744 --> 1:13:53.710
[Scoffs] Oh, no.
No way. Nuh-uh.

1:13:53.712 --> 1:13:54.844
I don't think so.

1:13:54.845 --> 1:13:55.977
They ruined
<i> my super sweet 16.</i>

1:13:55.980 --> 1:14:00.481
I am not going to let them
ruin my talent show.

1:14:02.785 --> 1:14:05.235
Hello, yasmin.

1:14:05.236 --> 1:14:07.686
So you see, it's really
in your best interest

1:14:07.689 --> 1:14:09.121
to drop out
of the talent show,

1:14:09.123 --> 1:14:11.022
or I'll be forced
to go public

1:14:11.024 --> 1:14:13.758
with all these
embarrassing flaws that I have

1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:15.092
right here on your friends--

1:14:15.094 --> 1:14:18.662
Sasha, jade, and
particularly clover.

1:14:18.664 --> 1:14:19.880
Cloe.

1:14:19.881 --> 1:14:21.097
Same thing.
I'm pretty sure cloe

1:14:21.099 --> 1:14:23.132
wouldn't want
the entire student body

1:14:23.134 --> 1:14:26.568
to know that when her mother
worked for us,

1:14:26.570 --> 1:14:29.070
things just disappeared.

1:14:29.072 --> 1:14:32.406
Poor girl.
How terribly pitiful.

1:14:32.408 --> 1:14:34.107
You are so devious.

1:14:34.109 --> 1:14:36.409
Thank you.

1:14:36.411 --> 1:14:38.444
I mean, I hate to do it,

1:14:38.446 --> 1:14:41.146
but you can certainly
see my predicament

1:14:41.148 --> 1:14:42.614
and yours.

1:14:42.616 --> 1:14:44.482
Can't you?

1:14:44.484 --> 1:14:46.300
How pathetic.

1:14:46.301 --> 1:14:48.117
I can't believe you.
You spend half your time

1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:49.652
documenting dirt
on everyone else.

1:14:49.654 --> 1:14:51.487
You really need
to get a life.

1:14:51.489 --> 1:14:54.590
Oh, I have one,
and it is fabulous.

1:14:54.592 --> 1:14:56.692
Save it.

1:14:56.694 --> 1:14:58.760
Just leave cloe alone.

1:25:15.448 --> 1:25:18.149

1:25:18.151 --> 1:25:20.351
Judges,

1:25:20.353 --> 1:25:21.352
Wait a minute.

1:25:21.354 --> 1:25:22.786
There's still
one more act.

1:25:22.788 --> 1:25:26.222
Uh, no. The show is over,
with a capital "over."

1:25:26.224 --> 1:25:27.356
Hey, listen.
The girls signed up.

1:25:27.358 --> 1:25:30.225
They deserve
the right to perform.

1:25:30.227 --> 1:25:31.159
He's right.

1:25:31.161 --> 1:25:32.260
Meredith: Oh, please.

1:25:32.261 --> 1:25:33.360
I know the rules,
but thanks anyway.

1:25:33.363 --> 1:25:35.696
Hey, those are my parents
you're talkin' to.

1:25:35.698 --> 1:25:38.131
You will not
disrespect them like that.

1:25:38.133 --> 1:25:39.900
Have you considered
anger management?

1:25:39.902 --> 1:25:41.835
Oh, Meredith, bag it.

1:25:41.837 --> 1:25:42.869
Introduce us, cloe.

1:25:42.871 --> 1:25:46.205
Wait. Are you sure
you wanna do this

1:25:46.207 --> 1:25:48.273
to your friends, yasmin?

1:25:53.179 --> 1:25:55.479
Well, then,
it is my responsibility

1:25:55.481 --> 1:25:58.065
as your student body
president

1:25:58.066 --> 1:26:00.650

1:26:03.688 --> 1:26:05.354
[Beep]

1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:11.793
Exhibit "a,"
the fashionista.

1:26:11.795 --> 1:26:14.529
I say imposterista.

1:26:14.531 --> 1:26:18.566
She lies to her parents,
to her teachers,

1:26:18.568 --> 1:26:19.733
and to you.

1:26:19.735 --> 1:26:22.435
This is who
you think she is.

Here's the dealio.

1:26:28.308 --> 1:26:31.509
I'm not either of those girls
Meredith showed you.

1:26:31.511 --> 1:26:37.481
I'm both. I love science
and math and my parents...

1:26:37.483 --> 1:26:38.715
A lot,

1:26:38.717 --> 1:26:40.750
but I have
a passion for fashion.

1:26:40.752 --> 1:26:42.718
It's how I express
who I am,

1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:45.654
and if I can't do that,
I'm nobody.

1:26:45.656 --> 1:26:49.524
I want everyone in my life
to accept that. Sorry.

1:26:49.526 --> 1:26:51.425
Pathetic, isn't it?

1:26:51.427 --> 1:26:54.561
Well, nowhere
as pathetic as this.

1:26:54.563 --> 1:26:57.230
Exhibit "b,"
the soccer jock.

1:26:57.232 --> 1:26:59.832
All-American girl?
The perfect daughter?

1:26:59.834 --> 1:27:03.969
You decide. When her mother
desperately needed a job,

1:27:03.971 --> 1:27:08.539
my family was kind enough
to offer her employment

1:27:08.541 --> 1:27:09.773
as our maid.

1:27:09.775 --> 1:27:12.208
And how did her daughter
repay this kindness?

1:27:12.210 --> 1:27:17.713
By stealing my favorite,
most beloved Dolly.

1:27:17.715 --> 1:27:21.450
Ow. It still hurts.

1:27:21.452 --> 1:27:22.851
Look, it's true.

1:27:22.853 --> 1:27:25.353
My mom did clean
Meredith's house.

1:27:25.355 --> 1:27:29.389
She would do anything
to provide for us.

1:27:30.258 --> 1:27:32.725
My mom...

1:27:34.261 --> 1:27:36.494
My mom is my hero.

1:27:38.264 --> 1:27:40.964
[Mouths words]

1:27:40.966 --> 1:27:43.299
But I never
took your doll.

1:27:43.301 --> 1:27:44.400
Actually, I did.

1:27:44.402 --> 1:27:46.769
You were using it
as a doorstop.

1:27:46.771 --> 1:27:48.837
I eavesdropped
on my sister,

1:27:48.839 --> 1:27:50.305
and then I betrayed her.

1:27:50.307 --> 1:27:52.807
Yasmin, I'm very sorry.

1:27:52.809 --> 1:27:54.975
Most of my friends think
I'm a tough jock,

1:27:54.977 --> 1:27:58.712
but I been takin' ballet
since I was 5.

1:27:58.714 --> 1:28:00.714
And you know what?
I like it.

1:28:00.716 --> 1:28:01.548
[Applause]

1:28:01.550 --> 1:28:04.617
I cheated on my pop quiz

1:28:04.619 --> 1:28:06.819
and my midterm

1:28:06.821 --> 1:28:09.188
and my final.

1:28:09.189 --> 1:28:11.556
I'm bubbie, and I am
a chocoholic.

1:28:11.559 --> 1:28:13.525
All: Hi, bubbie.

1:28:13.527 --> 1:28:15.494

1:28:15.495 --> 1:28:17.462
