That was fast.

01:21.614 --> 01:22.649
MAGNUM:
Yeah,

01:22.715 --> 01:24.484
a lot less security
than I expected.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.453
And I expected you to lie

01:26.519 --> 01:28.621
about how many security guards
you had to take out.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.623
(chuckles)
Remember in Shakhty

01:30.690 --> 01:33.226
when he took out
a pack of insurgents?

01:33.293 --> 01:35.195
Why do we have to keep having
this conversation?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.496
Three is a pack.

01:36.563 --> 01:39.532
Okay, White Knight.
Whatever you say.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.469
You see the painting?

01:42.535 --> 01:43.870
Yeah.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.605
Actually,
there's a few paintings.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.640
Hang on. Just to be clear,

01:47.707 --> 01:49.409
is it a pack of paintings?

01:49.476 --> 01:51.878
Funny.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.558
Found it.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.560
Retinal scanner and all.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.529
So far, so good on the intel.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.131
You got the baggie?

02:11.197 --> 02:12.565
Unfortunately, yes.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.702
And it is disgusting.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.639
(scanner whirring)

02:28.648 --> 02:30.383
You got to be kidding me.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.751
What's the matter?

02:32.552 --> 02:33.686
It's empty.

02:33.753 --> 02:34.721
Well, maybe our intel

02:34.787 --> 02:36.155
wasn't so good after all.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.591
Maybe security was light
for a reason.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.693
Ah, somebody
could've gotten here first,

02:40.760 --> 02:43.263
taken out a few guards,
emptied the safe.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.740
Yeah, yeah. If that's the case,

02:53.806 --> 02:55.875
they're probably long gone
by now.

02:55.942 --> 02:59.279
Meet me back at the checkpoint
in 90 seconds.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.558
(grunting)

03:38.518 --> 03:39.752
Drop it.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.255
And take off the mask.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.570
Who are you?

03:57.637 --> 03:59.539
The name's Belle.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.641
T.R. Belle.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.610
"And as the White Knight
studied Belle,

04:03.676 --> 04:06.879
"the corner of his mouth
lifted up ever so slightly.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.982
"It was a self-satisfied grin,

04:09.048 --> 04:11.551
"and once Belle had seen it,
she wanted nothing more

04:11.618 --> 04:13.653
"than to wipe it off his face

04:13.720 --> 04:15.355
with her foot."

04:15.421 --> 04:16.556
ETHAN:
Wow.

04:16.623 --> 04:17.991
That is what I call
an introduction.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.959
I'm loving this book.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.959
(chuckles)

04:20.026 --> 04:21.561
Yeah. I mean,

04:21.628 --> 04:23.563
Robin sure knows
how to spin a good yarn.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.597
I'll give him that.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.566
What's wrong?

04:26.633 --> 04:30.269
I mean, sure, the plot is...

04:30.336 --> 04:31.904
It's diverting.

04:31.971 --> 04:35.408
It's just the way
that Robin describes T.R. Belle.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.976
She's cold.

04:37.043 --> 04:40.413
Aloof and judgmental.
Controlling.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.581
Come on, it's just a book.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.616
T.R. Belle
is definitely not you.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.385
I know,
but she was inspired by me.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.819
Well, the parts of her

04:46.886 --> 04:48.821
that are you, I can totally see.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.823
I mean, she's brilliant.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.592
Strong. Witty.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.394
Go on.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.729
(chuckles)
Decisive.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.464
Athletic.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.299
Sexy.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.200
And?

05:01.267 --> 05:04.604
And about to be
deservedly frustrated.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.872
Huh.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.573
Did not see that one coming.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.610
No, no, no, it's just I, uh,
I really need to split.

05:10.677 --> 05:11.944
Patients
are starting to line up.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.447
Hey, are you sure
you don't want to join me?

05:14.514 --> 05:15.882
I'm only two counties over.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.617
I, uh, have to fly
the other doctors

05:17.684 --> 05:18.885
to Bartolimo in the morning.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.787
(chuckles)
It's funny

05:20.853 --> 05:22.789
how we traveled
halfway around the world

05:22.855 --> 05:24.857
just to, uh, video chat.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.026
Well,
it's what we signed up for.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.429
Go where the help is needed.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.031
You are the best.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.467
All right, get to it.

05:34.534 --> 05:37.070
I have over 200 more pages

05:37.136 --> 05:40.039
of bittersweet overanalyzing
to do.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.574
All right.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.943
Have fun. I miss you.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.280
Bye.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.280
(computer chimes)

05:51.517 --> 05:53.753
I wonder what Magnum thinks.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.023
Honestly, it's not as good
as his last one.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.692
I really hope Robin
hasn't lost his touch.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.127
That's a bit extreme.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.696
I think it lacks the realism
of his earlier stuff.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.866
Oh, yeah, like the one where
you parachuted from outer space.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.067
TC: (chuckles)
I think he's just

06:08.134 --> 06:10.603
a little bit jelly
because the White Knight

06:10.670 --> 06:12.071
ends up being upstaged

06:12.138 --> 06:14.941
by T.R. Belle.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.941
That's ridiculous.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.110
I don't know,
I think TC has a point here.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.044
You think I'm jealous

06:18.111 --> 06:20.012
because a character
loosely based on me

06:20.079 --> 06:23.616
gets upstaged by a character
that's loosely based on Higgins?

06:23.683 --> 06:25.685
I mean, come on.
I think it's great Robin

06:25.752 --> 06:26.986
finally put a woman in the mix.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.821
Yeah, totally.
I mean, up until now,

06:28.888 --> 06:30.556
the White Knight books
have been a total sausage fest.

06:30.623 --> 06:31.691
TC:
That's true.

06:30.623 --> 06:31.691
(door closes)

06:31.758 --> 06:33.760
RICK:
Speaking of beautiful women

06:33.826 --> 06:35.995
crashing a sausage fest...

06:33.826 --> 06:35.995
Very funny.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.065
Oh, my God. Isn't
the book amazing?

06:36.062 --> 06:39.065
Uh,

06:39.132 --> 06:40.433
yeah. Parts of it.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.968
Did you get to chapter nine yet?

06:42.034 --> 06:43.136
No. Why?

06:43.202 --> 06:45.104
That's when you hook up
with Juliet.

06:46.539 --> 06:48.574
I definitely did not read that,

06:48.641 --> 06:50.009
but, uh, thank you
for the image.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.945
(chuckles) Don't blame me.
Mr. Masters wrote it.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.680
Well, I'm definitely gonna skip
that chapter.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.682
Good idea. It's pretty steamy.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.950
(chuckles)
Anyway,

06:58.017 --> 06:59.952
I need background checks
on some new staff.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.420
You got it, boss.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.420
Okay.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.956
But, uh, first,
I got to run.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.925
I got to go meet a client.
I'll see you guys later.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.794
Oh, oh, oh. I just, uh, put in

07:07.860 --> 07:09.529
some new ti plants
near the main house.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.097
Try not to trample through them

07:11.164 --> 07:12.965
next time the lads
are chasing you.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.834
Okay. I'll be sure
to watch where I step

07:14.901 --> 07:17.203
next time I am running
for my life. (chuckles)

07:20.807 --> 07:22.742
Higgins has been gone
for five months,

07:22.809 --> 07:25.611
so it's not surprising
that we all miss her.

07:25.678 --> 07:29.448
Still, I got to say, it's nice
being a lone-wolf P.I. again.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.617
No one to answer to,
and I get to pick all the cases,

07:31.684 --> 07:34.187
so it doesn't have to be
about chasing the money.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.622
Case in point,
I got a call yesterday

07:36.689 --> 07:38.825
from a struggling single mom
named Jenny Liu.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.494
Not a lucrative case,
but rewarding.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.730
And I admit, I kind of have
a soft spot for single mothers,

07:44.797 --> 07:48.067
having been raised
by one myself.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.139
How you doing?

07:53.206 --> 07:54.540
Thomas Magnum.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.008
I have an appointment
with Jenny.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.911
I'm Dan, Jenny's father.
And she's not here.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.582
That's odd.
She confirmed just yesterday.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.517
I don't know anything
about that.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.787
Well, do you have any idea
when she'll be back?

08:04.584 --> 08:07.787
I wish

08:07.854 --> 08:09.689
I did. She didn't come home
from work last night.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.191
Are you telling me
she's missing?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.729
Look, I'm sorry. I have to go.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.729
Hold on.

08:17.797 --> 08:18.831
I think I can help.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.199
How?

08:20.266 --> 08:22.068
Who are you, exactly?

08:22.134 --> 08:24.237
Someone who knows
how to find people.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.007
♪ ♪

08:45.658 --> 08:48.194
DAN: When I couldn't reach Jenny
on her cell, I called the hotel

08:48.261 --> 08:50.062
where she works on the
overnight cleaning crew.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.697
I talked to one
of her coworkers.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.299
He said he hadn't
seen her in weeks.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.101
But as far as we knew,

08:55.167 --> 08:56.969
she was still going to work
every night.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.071
Is there anything else
about Jenny

08:59.138 --> 09:00.306
that might be helpful to know?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.209
Has she been
in any kind of trouble

09:03.276 --> 09:06.212
or get into
any recent altercations?

09:08.247 --> 09:10.816
A few years ago,
Jenny moved to Vegas

09:10.883 --> 09:12.952
to be a dealer at a casino.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.687
It was a good job

09:14.754 --> 09:16.822
till she fell in
with the wrong crowd,

09:16.889 --> 09:20.092
and she developed a pretty
serious drug problem.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.261
She came home to get help.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.564
I thought she was clean,
but now...

09:25.631 --> 09:27.033
You think
she's been using again.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.101
Or up to something illegal.

09:29.168 --> 09:32.138
She already has a record
for theft.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.040
(exhales)

09:34.106 --> 09:36.575
You mind if I hang on
to that photo?

09:37.209 --> 09:40.713
Pap, you said Mommy
would be back now.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.281
Where is she?

09:43.382 --> 09:46.686
Uh, you must be Emma.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.887
My name's Thomas,

09:47.954 --> 09:50.156
and I'm a friend of your mom's,
and we were supposed to have

09:50.222 --> 09:52.191
a meeting today,
but she didn't make it.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.760
That just means
I have to go find her.

09:55.728 --> 09:56.829
Don't worry,

09:56.896 --> 09:58.164
I will.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.299
And she'll be back home
in no time.

10:00.366 --> 10:01.834
Promise?

10:01.901 --> 10:03.035

10:55.287 --> 10:57.056
I'm looking for a missing woman
named Jenny Liu.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.059
I need anything you can find

MAGNUM: Yeah, you know what?

11:27.319 --> 11:29.455
I'm right there with you.
I mean, I-I only heard about it,

11:29.522 --> 11:32.191
but I'm definitely gonna skip
that chapter.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.293
In fact, I might even tear
those pages out. I have

11:34.360 --> 11:36.162
no idea what Robin was thinking.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.763
I'm talking
about my introduction.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.099
Wh-Why?
What are you talking about?

11:40.933 --> 11:42.701
Uh... n-nothing.

11:42.768 --> 11:45.104
Uh, so,
about those financials...

11:45.171 --> 11:48.240
Just, uh, send me
Ms. Liu's info.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.209
Of course. Thanks, Higgy.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.944
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.180
Can you make sure you get back
to me at a reasonable hour?

Well, it's a surprise.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.398
I could give you a hint,
but that would ruin...

12:12.465 --> 12:15.067
Five Coco Puffs
from Liliha Bakery.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.002
How'd you know? Why five?

12:17.069 --> 12:19.872
That box is the size they use
for their half dozen order,

12:19.939 --> 12:21.807
but there's a small
chocolate smudge on the edge,

12:21.874 --> 12:23.008
so I'm guessing
you ate one.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.744
Also, Coco Puffs
are half off today, and...

12:32.918 --> 12:34.520
to put out a BOLO
on a woman named Jenny Liu.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.889
She's been missing
since last night.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.090
Also,

12:38.157 --> 12:39.291
I'd like you to ping
her cell phone

12:39.358 --> 12:40.826
so I can track
her last location.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.095
Well, she needs to be missing
for 48 hours.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.130
You know that.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.798
Did I say "last night"?

12:45.865 --> 12:48.134
I did say "last night."
I meant two nights ago.

It's a rehab facility.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.881
Okay. Thank you.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.483
Can you give us
a minute, please?

21:58.550 --> 22:00.352
Thanks.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.989
(sighs)
We'll work on IDing the perps.

22:05.691 --> 22:06.758
What is it?

22:06.825 --> 22:07.926
It's a long shot,

22:07.993 --> 22:10.429
but I might know
how to find Jenny.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.964
How?

22:10.495 --> 22:12.964
Just gonna follow my gut.

22:13.031 --> 22:15.467
That's your plan?
Follow your gut?

22:15.534 --> 22:16.968
It's code for "You
don't want to know

22:17.035 --> 22:18.770
but I'll keep you in the loop."

22:17.035 --> 22:18.770
LIA:
Oh.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.405
Got it.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.040
Here.

22:22.841 --> 22:26.011
Oh, hold on. All right,
is this... this me right here?

22:26.078 --> 22:28.580
EMMA:
Yeah.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.580
And I'm guessing

22:28.647 --> 22:29.981
I'm bringing Mommy home?

22:30.048 --> 22:31.616
Well,

22:31.683 --> 22:32.851
you're really talented,

22:32.918 --> 22:35.854
and I got to say, I love it.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.889
Thank you.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.889
(chuckles)
You're welcome.

MAGNUM:
When you're the only child
of a single parent,

22:42.928 --> 22:44.596
a special bond is formed.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.665
My mom left this world
way too early,

22:46.732 --> 22:48.500
but at least
she was around long enough

22:48.567 --> 22:50.001
to usher me into adulthood,

22:50.068 --> 22:52.370
and I'm thankful every day
for that.

22:52.437 --> 22:54.706
Emma deserves the same thing,
which is why

22:54.773 --> 22:57.109
I need to do whatever it takes
to find Jenny.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.545

23:03.081 --> 23:05.383
I'm on my way to see Rick. Why?

23:06.017 --> 23:07.552
I need a favor.

23:07.619 --> 23:10.122
Yes. I know, for once, it is I

23:10.188 --> 23:11.623
that needs a favor from you.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.025
We are
through the looking glass,

23:14.092 --> 23:15.594
as they say.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.963
But I'm dealing
with a rather urgent situation

23:18.029 --> 23:19.664
for which I require some help.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.767
What kind of help?

23:19.731 --> 23:21.767
HIGGINS:
Operational support.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.603
Intel. I tried tapping
my MI6 resources,

23:24.669 --> 23:26.671
but they were abruptly cut off.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.039
Which was odd.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.642
What do you need me to do?

23:32.144 --> 23:34.045
M.E. pulled slugs
from our vics.

23:34.112 --> 23:35.814
Bullets came
from two different guns,

23:35.881 --> 23:37.082
which means two shooters.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.550
Or one shooter with two guns.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.852
I think you've seen too many
John Woo movies.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.188
Plus,
entry wound angles indicate

23:43.255 --> 23:44.189
two triggermen.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.791
M.E. also put T.O.D.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.859
between 11:30 and midnight.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.528
Now the good news.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.630
A surveillance camera
in the alley

23:51.696 --> 23:54.166
tagged one of the shooters
around 11:45.

23:54.232 --> 23:57.202

I just talked to my guy
at Navy Intel,

24:04.176 --> 24:06.077
and he's got a location
on the Wangari boys.

Hey,

24:09.915 --> 24:11.716
you want to thank me?
You pass this information on

24:11.783 --> 24:14.219
to the Kenyan Army so they
can get the vaccines back.

24:15.053 --> 24:16.855
I don't see that as an option.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.690
Yeah, that's

flying doctors around Kenya

24:23.295 --> 24:24.596

24:24.663 --> 24:27.232
You need
something more than that.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.235
I just don't think you should be
taking unnecessary risks.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.637
You don't have to worry, Thomas.
I can handle myself.

24:32.704 --> 24:35.807

24:43.081 --> 24:45.016
Hey, guys.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.651
Thomas. Hi.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.653
Hey, pal.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.653
Sorry to interrupt.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.223
Uh, can I borrow him

24:51.289 --> 24:52.958
He's all yours.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.059
Thank you.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.126
All the guys at the table

24:55.193 --> 24:56.494
were high rollers.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.494
Yeah.

24:56.561 --> 24:57.963
Not a lot of people
on this island

24:58.029 --> 24:59.097
run games at those stakes.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.166
I can ask around,
see who set it up.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.667
Yeah, I'm just hoping
after what happened,

25:02.734 --> 25:04.603
Jenny reaches out
to whoever hired her.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.738
I'll get right on it.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.738
Thanks.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.840
(phone vibrating)

25:09.908 --> 25:11.042
Gordie.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.510
Got an ID
on one of the shooters.

25:12.577 --> 25:13.812
Name's Patrick McGowan.

25:13.879 --> 25:16.281
He's a hit man for hire.
According to the Feds,

25:16.348 --> 25:17.816
he works
with his brother Sean.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.651
They both got in from Philly
three days ago.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.519
Okay, well,
I'm thinking a couple hitters

25:21.586 --> 25:22.754
from Philly
aren't gonna fly to Hawaii

25:22.821 --> 25:24.055
to knock over a poker game,
right?

25:24.122 --> 25:25.290
So, what are we thinking?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.058
They were after
one of the players

25:27.125 --> 25:28.526
but used the robbery as a cover?

25:28.593 --> 25:30.228
LIA:
That was our initial thought.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.297
But then we pulled location data
from Patrick's cell,

25:32.364 --> 25:33.899
and get this.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.534
He was outside Jenny's house
yesterday afternoon.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.670
He was also near the gas station

25:38.737 --> 25:40.105
where she filled her car
last night.

25:40.171 --> 25:41.273
So she was their target.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.074
That's what it looks like.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.043
They must've tailed her
to that alley,

25:45.110 --> 25:46.811
then followed her
inside the building,

25:46.878 --> 25:48.880
having no idea
she'd be in a room

25:48.947 --> 25:49.915
with several armed men.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.017
Uh, question now is
what these guys were doing

25:52.083 --> 25:53.885
going after Jenny
in the first place.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.253
I don't know,
but my gut tells me

25:55.320 --> 25:56.288
it's got something to do
with the reason

25:56.354 --> 25:57.822
she wanted to hire me.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.024
We figure that out,

25:59.090 --> 26:01.860
maybe we find our killers.

practically a coworker.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.199
I've worked hard

Looks like Jenny was trying
to get ahold of a guy

28:05.850 --> 28:08.153
named Barry Costigan.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.153

I don't know, but they were
at Clear Path together

28:09.821 --> 28:12.457
around the same time.
I guess they were pretty close.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.992
Jenny was starting
to get worried

28:14.059 --> 28:16.761
because he wasn't responding
to texts or phone calls.

28:16.828 --> 28:20.165
Maybe she wanted to hire
you to track him down.

28:16.828 --> 28:20.165
Yeah.

29:13.852 --> 29:14.819
Hello?

29:14.886 --> 29:18.289
Juliet Higgins.
Your reputation precedes you.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.424
And this is?

29:19.491 --> 29:22.160
Call me Eve. I'm with...

29:19.491 --> 29:22.160
MI6.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.028
I couldn't trace the call,
but I recognize

29:24.095 --> 29:27.298
the firewall that prevented me
from doing so.

29:27.365 --> 29:29.434
To what do I owe the pleasure?

29:29.501 --> 29:31.903
I'm calling
about your recent mission.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.539
Beg your pardon?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.774
To recover the vaccines.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.979
You of all people shouldn't be
surprised by our capabilities.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.114
I'm just...

29:43.181 --> 29:45.316
surprised
that you bothered to monitor

29:45.383 --> 29:47.185
something so insignificant.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.354
We only did so after you tried
to access our system

29:49.420 --> 29:51.523
for information
on Joseph Wangari.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.224
And had you been successful,

29:53.291 --> 29:55.059
you may have discovered
that the gang you incapacitated

29:55.126 --> 29:57.228
actually provides us
with key intel

29:57.295 --> 29:58.997
on terror groups in Kenya.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.933
Well...

30:02.000 --> 30:03.434
Sorry about that.

30:03.501 --> 30:05.937
No, you're not.
But you should be.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.106
Because while you managed
to conceal your identity,

30:08.173 --> 30:10.808
word is they're determined
to find you.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.077
And when they do,
they'll want retribution,

30:13.144 --> 30:14.579
which means
that your little recovery op

30:14.646 --> 30:16.514
may have put
the entire medical community

30:16.581 --> 30:18.816
you've been working with
in harm's way.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.452
Fortunately for you,
we can fix that

30:21.519 --> 30:23.254
and guarantee their safety.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.356
In exchange for what?

30:25.423 --> 30:28.092
Well, for starters,
you'll need to leave Kenya.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.360
Immediately.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.062
"For starters"?

30:31.129 --> 30:33.965
Meaning that there's
something else that you want.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.935
Yes.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.506
Hey.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.341
He's not a cop, right?

30:41.573 --> 30:43.341
No.

30:43.408 --> 30:44.909
I'm a private investigator,

30:44.976 --> 30:47.178
and I only care
about finding my client.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.917
I moonlight as a card dealer
for a guy named Devin Sykes.

30:52.984 --> 30:55.253
He set up last night's game,
and then he went underground

30:55.320 --> 30:56.955
after he heard
what happened.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.924
I was supposed to deal
last night,

30:59.991 --> 31:01.926
but I asked Jenny to fill in.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.129
I feel awful.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.129
RICK:
No,

31:05.196 --> 31:07.599
it's not your fault, Keana.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.599
MAGNUM:
No, he's right.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.168
But maybe you can help

Yeah. The number
to Jenny's burner

31:15.607 --> 31:17.108
that she used
for the poker game.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.510
Text it to me. I'll ping it.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.510
MAGNUM:
Yeah.

31:21.346 --> 31:23.982
Any luck with Costigan?

31:21.346 --> 31:23.982
No.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.384
And even if we could locate him,
he won't be of much help.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.953
Why? What do you got?

31:26.451 --> 31:28.953
KATSUMOTO:
The McGowan brothers

31:29.020 --> 31:31.422
paid him a visit two days ago.
Gave him a beatdown,

31:31.489 --> 31:33.024
shot him
and hauled away the body.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.525
And how'd you come up with that?

31:34.592 --> 31:36.294
Well, we saw it happen.

31:36.361 --> 31:39.664
Costigan had a motion-activated
treat dispenser that allowed him

31:39.731 --> 31:41.566
to monitor and feed his cat
while he was away.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.668
It captured
most of the encounter on video.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.303
What'd they want with Costigan?

31:45.370 --> 31:47.505
People in rehab
tend to reveal secrets

31:47.572 --> 31:49.107
that they otherwise wouldn't,

31:49.173 --> 31:51.976
and Jenny shared one
with Costigan at Clear Path.

31:52.043 --> 31:53.911
Told him she witnessed
the murder of a drug dealer

31:53.978 --> 31:56.381
when she was living in Vegas
and never said anything.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.616
And the trigger puller
had ties to the Philly mob.

31:58.683 --> 32:01.185
Had no idea
Jenny was in that room.

31:58.683 --> 32:01.185
MAGNUM: All right.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.187
So, let me guess.
Costigan was hard up for cash.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.956
He tries to blackmail
the shooter,

32:05.023 --> 32:07.225
so then they send the McGowans
to deal with him.

32:07.292 --> 32:08.993
And to figure out how the hell
he knew what he knew.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.195
So, he turns in Jenny,
the very person

32:11.262 --> 32:14.165
who was worried enough about him
to hire me.

32:14.232 --> 32:15.466
Some friend.

32:15.533 --> 32:16.934
