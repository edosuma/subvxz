08:05.116 --> 08:07.798
- Hello you.
- Hi.

08:09.568 --> 08:12.203
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?

08:14.436 --> 08:15.539
Sleepy.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.777
When did you come here?

08:18.888 --> 08:20.523
I've been here since.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.045
What do you mean?

08:23.658 --> 08:25.285
Since this morning.

08:26.064 --> 08:27.547
We've seen each other.

08:27.991 --> 08:29.634
- Today?
- You don't remember?

08:30.236 --> 08:31.338
No.

08:31.364 --> 08:32.935
You're so sleepy.

08:34.316 --> 08:35.760
Sorry.

08:35.943 --> 08:38.252
Nice to see you fast asleep.

08:40.950 --> 08:43.180
Have you been sitting there?

08:43.220 --> 08:44.823
I looked at the photos.

08:54.615 --> 08:56.749
That's beautiful.

09:00.878 --> 09:01.988
This one..

09:02.768 --> 09:04.204
This is new.

09:04.426 --> 09:05.672
Very beautiful.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.451
I dreamed about the dog.

09:21.105 --> 09:24.518
The dog was hit by a car
while trying to enter my house.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.804
I let him die.

09:27.829 --> 09:30.653
Juan picked it up
and I took it to the vet.

09:32.941 --> 09:35.559
The doctor said the dog was very sick.

09:36.303 --> 09:40.294
Either he gets a blood transfusion
or is euthanized.

09:41.811 --> 09:44.497
I asked him to leave it there
while I got home.

09:45.303 --> 09:47.175
To talk it over with Juan.

09:50.874 --> 09:52.842
That night
I started to feel...

09:53.578 --> 09:55.175
...all of these symptoms.

09:57.789 --> 09:59.889
And I forgot the dog.

10:03.332 --> 10:05.228
And now I only
dream about it.

10:09.411 --> 10:11.669
You think the dog cursed me?

10:20.912 --> 10:23.213
You want me to check on him?

10:31.434 --> 10:33.668
When I saw that dog out there...

10:34.667 --> 10:37.909
...I thought:
Gosh, people can be that cruel.

10:41.292 --> 10:44.244
Then I did
the same with the dog.

12:07.251 --> 12:08.732
Who is infected?

12:11.025 --> 12:12.144
Not!

12:13.404 --> 12:15.856
I've transferred
the sick to the lab.

12:18.109 --> 12:20.870
Don't use this bus card again.

12:22.795 --> 12:25.326
My bank card has also expired.

12:33.192 --> 12:36.104
How long will they be
doing construction next door?

12:36.842 --> 12:39.103
There is no construction next to the house.

12:39.808 --> 12:42.597
I heard it, early in the morning.
No!

12:42.622 --> 12:43.836
When it's still dark.

12:43.861 --> 12:46.026
Maybe it's not far from home.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.151
Possible.

12:54.495 --> 12:57.170
Can you think of a
poem about mushrooms?

13:02.200 --> 13:05.265
What is something that
comes from this living being?

13:07.433 --> 13:09.765
The smell of a virus.

13:09.933 --> 13:13.032
Rotten perfume.

13:14.942 --> 13:19.108
Write a poem about bacteria.

13:25.447 --> 13:26.764
Continue.

13:29.633 --> 13:32.865
Swollen wounds.

13:33.300 --> 13:36.532
Molecular perspective.

13:37.044 --> 13:40.986
Want to dance without an organ.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.199
You inspire me.

13:49.771 --> 13:51.856
More poetry for books.

13:53.017 --> 13:55.183
Can you help translate
to English?

13:55.620 --> 13:57.265
With my lousy Spanish?

13:57.469 --> 14:01.265
Your Spanish is perfect for poetry.

14:32.429 --> 14:34.302
Does this need to be signed?

14:34.968 --> 14:37.607
Yes, especially death certificates.

14:38.606 --> 14:41.059
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

14:53.150 --> 14:55.086
It's a loan.

14:58.628 --> 15:00.499
Transfer of money.

15:03.212 --> 15:05.100
Sign here.

17:46.054 --> 17:52.032
Wood expands and absorbs water and
whatever is around it.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.499
It is hydroscopic.

17:54.524 --> 17:57.332
Wood is a hydroscopic material.

17:57.795 --> 17:59.232
Here we can see...

17:59.987 --> 18:05.799
... how much pressure does the
ring need for a few days ...

18:07.433 --> 18:13.632
... for the material to stick,
to last a long time.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.099
With a low-quality tool, it
will peel off.

18:17.466 --> 18:19.532
Small cracks appear.

19:08.204 --> 19:10.032
Excuse me.

19:10.386 --> 19:12.265
Hernan?
Already?

19:13.639 --> 19:16.065
Jessica. Pleased to meet you.
I also.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.899
I'm Juan's friend.

19:18.066 --> 19:19.799
Yes, of course.

19:19.966 --> 19:22.656
Thank you for coming to see me.
Does not matter.

19:22.688 --> 19:24.902
- I studied with Professor Juan.
- I know.

19:26.228 --> 19:28.215
Can you wait a minute
while I finish this?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.132
Sure, you want me to wait outside?

19:30.152 --> 19:33.072
Not. Here, please.
OK.

19:40.218 --> 19:41.397
Please.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.592
So...

21:36.566 --> 21:38.865
...your voice isn't a song?

21:38.939 --> 21:40.356
No.

21:40.725 --> 21:42.465
It's a sound.

21:43.716 --> 21:45.999
Hard to explain.

21:46.541 --> 21:48.732
Where did you hear that?

21:49.415 --> 21:51.165
In a room.

21:55.066 --> 21:57.465
Like...

22:00.860 --> 22:05.499
...concrete balls...

22:06.483 --> 22:08.565
...the big one,...

22:08.915 --> 22:14.199
... who fell into a metal well ...

22:15.935 --> 22:20.499
... surrounded by sea water.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.165
Perhaps that is impossible.

22:31.367 --> 22:32.532
No, no.

22:33.947 --> 22:37.465
Actually, after Juan called,
I prepared some tracks.

22:37.510 --> 22:38.899
- Really?
- Yes.

22:48.391 --> 22:51.765
How big is the concrete ball?

22:52.875 --> 22:54.272
How big?

23:06.157 --> 23:08.236
Then his voice lowered.

23:12.347 --> 23:15.517
It might sound different to me.

23:17.991 --> 23:19.038
Good.

23:21.649 --> 23:23.220
Listen this.

23:37.117 --> 23:40.432
The echo is different.

23:41.146 --> 23:43.732
More metal.

24:01.197 --> 24:02.965
More...

24:06.800 --> 24:08.532
... "earth."

24:10.543 --> 24:11.781
That..

24:14.027 --> 24:16.658
More down to earth.

24:18.007 --> 24:20.346
That..

24:20.870 --> 24:25.375
Like the roar of ...

24:26.122 --> 24:28.018
... the center of the Earth.

24:31.515 --> 24:32.760
Sorry.

24:35.744 --> 24:37.332
Let me try something.

24:41.759 --> 24:44.932
This is a collection...

24:44.958 --> 24:47.132
...movie sound effects.

24:56.341 --> 24:59.460
An attack on the stomach
while wearing a hooded jacket.

25:00.309 --> 25:01.309
What's that?

25:01.651 --> 25:02.928
Is that his voice?

25:09.990 --> 25:11.365
How about this?

25:11.486 --> 25:14.600
The body was hit by the blanket
and then hit by the wood.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.311
Which one ...?
That one.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.644
Fine.

25:28.071 --> 25:30.665
Yes, that's close.

25:32.602 --> 25:36.865
I will import it.

26:45.064 --> 26:46.732
Yes, there he is.

26:58.471 --> 27:01.499
Sorry. But maybe something more...

27:03.558 --> 27:04.932
...round.

27:06.072 --> 27:07.133
Fine.

27:20.433 --> 27:22.965
Look at this mountain.

27:31.319 --> 27:33.199
And now listen to this.

27:43.548 --> 27:45.398
Maybe heavier?

27:47.215 --> 27:48.215
More...

27:48.588 --> 27:49.857
...bas?
Ya.

27:49.882 --> 27:50.945
Good.

28:20.003 --> 28:22.398
This is between 60 and 100 Hz.

28:35.135 --> 28:40.699
The bass depends on what
you use to hear the sound.

28:43.133 --> 28:49.032
On the chorus,
on the television set, in the cinema,...

28:50.276 --> 28:52.532
...or with a sound system like this.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.499
I don't know.

29:40.932 --> 29:42.019
Good.

29:43.335 --> 29:44.765
Let me save it first.

29:54.521 --> 29:56.765
Excuse me, what was your name earlier?

30:05.391 --> 30:06.859
What was your name?

30:10.654 --> 30:11.725
Jessica.

31:53.949 --> 31:55.232
Can I help you?

31:56.468 --> 31:57.599
Excuse me?

31:59.110 --> 32:00.898
I have to go into that room.

32:01.547 --> 32:04.165
Oh, sorry. Yes.

32:11.002 --> 32:13.132
Thank you.
You're welcome.

32:16.215 --> 32:17.342
Let me help.

32:20.493 --> 32:21.566
Thank you.

32:28.255 --> 32:31.032
I don't have the key to lock it
and my team hasn't arrived yet.

32:31.057 --> 32:32.200
It's okay.

32:41.666 --> 32:43.265
You work here?

32:43.919 --> 32:45.332
No, my sister...

32:45.491 --> 32:49.411
My sister..
she's a patient in the treatment room.

32:50.530 --> 32:52.121
I'm sad too.

32:53.927 --> 32:55.149
This is the morgue?

32:56.601 --> 32:58.045
You can say that.

32:59.879 --> 33:01.811
You want to come in and have a look?

33:02.620 --> 33:03.683
Yes?

37:05.347 --> 37:08.347
<i>Hong Kong Restaurant
"Authentic Chinese Food"</i>

40:30.769 --> 40:35.699
Right mandibular condyle
indicates joint damage.

40:56.117 --> 40:58.648
Can you guess
if this is a boy or a girl?

41:04.287 --> 41:05.492
Man?

41:19.080 --> 41:21.635
This ... is a girl.

41:22.254 --> 41:23.587
Young girl.

41:24.595 --> 41:27.571
He was found in a tunnel
under a construction site.

41:29.903 --> 41:32.797
I'm leaving tomorrow
to join the retrieval team.

41:37.178 --> 41:40.228
It is probably 6000 years old.

41:43.188 --> 41:44.536
Hole?

41:46.670 --> 41:47.831
Yes.

41:48.685 --> 41:50.373
Maybe because of the ritual.

41:51.266 --> 41:54.602
They pierced his head
to cast out evil spirits.

42:03.585 --> 42:05.014
Feel it.

43:23.952 --> 43:25.382
Yes, this is it.

43:37.943 --> 43:39.899
I mix my voices.

44:34.647 --> 44:36.750
It's very touching.

44:37.813 --> 44:41.665
I was touched by your interpretation.

44:42.537 --> 44:43.600
Thank you.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.832
There is a little melody to my song.

44:49.124 --> 44:50.532
I have a band.

44:51.266 --> 44:53.999
Punk genre, electronic.

44:54.512 --> 44:56.699
What is your band name?

44:57.075 --> 44:59.632
The Depth of the Delusional Ensemble.

45:04.205 --> 45:05.403
Sorry.

45:06.277 --> 45:07.816
I didn't mean to laugh.

45:08.186 --> 45:10.321
That's a good name.

45:10.503 --> 45:13.250
- Yes?
- Yes. That's good.

45:18.824 --> 45:19.866
Thank you.

45:25.046 --> 45:29.965
Perhaps this song could be
one of your tracks later?

45:30.931 --> 45:34.132
Why not? That would be great.

45:34.749 --> 45:40.332
This song has some unique acoustic
and psychological aspects.

45:41.544 --> 45:43.799
I will write you as a collaborator.

45:56.377 --> 45:58.567
Delusional Depth.

46:07.344 --> 46:08.693
Come on.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.032
Have you ever been to Tokyo?

46:13.431 --> 46:14.965
Yes, why?

46:15.835 --> 46:17.365
I want to go there.

46:20.573 --> 46:22.932
I don't know what it's like:
the people, the...

46:23.100 --> 46:25.346
...the architecture.
It's so beautiful there.

46:25.371 --> 46:26.765
Really?Yes.

46:29.308 --> 46:30.732
I want...

46:32.628 --> 46:34.532
Concerts in Japan?

46:37.381 --> 46:38.632
You never know.

46:41.995 --> 46:44.532
How much interest
do you want to save?

46:44.614 --> 46:47.499
Several hundred, different types.

46:47.833 --> 46:49.399
This is for the farm.

46:49.578 --> 46:53.032
If onsite cold storage is required,...
Yes.

46:53.200 --> 46:57.265
...we can provide you with designs
and colors according to your taste.

46:57.766 --> 47:00.510
This is our cold storage equipment,...

47:00.535 --> 47:03.699
...designed especially for flowers.

47:03.960 --> 47:07.332
This one is local.
And this one is from Holland,...

47:07.365 --> 47:09.265
...in terms of the technology used.

47:09.349 --> 47:10.865
They look the same.

47:11.977 --> 47:15.032
This one "preserves"
flowers better.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.832
Survives about 30% longer.

47:20.033 --> 47:22.332
In here, time stops.

47:24.406 --> 47:28.532
All coated with
with Nano-Seal...

47:28.783 --> 47:32.632
...which prevents all kinds of fungi
and other pathogens.

47:33.172 --> 47:35.032
Do you have a distributor in Medellin?

47:35.100 --> 47:37.065
Yes, we have.

47:39.387 --> 47:40.832
Be careful.

47:42.101 --> 47:45.032
The cooler is assembled here.

47:45.232 --> 47:48.365
It is a mower.

47:50.296 --> 47:54.799
For cold storage on site...
Let me think.

47:56.382 --> 48:01.132
I have a client from last year.
What's his name..

48:02.461 --> 48:06.999
I gave you the address of a farm
not far from Bogota,...

48:07.389 --> 48:10.165
...so you can see how it works.

48:10.471 --> 48:15.199
I heard their sales skyrocketed
when they started using our coolers.

48:15.257 --> 48:16.999
Can I?
Sure?

48:20.510 --> 48:22.065
I know where this is.

48:22.114 --> 48:26.532
I will prepare the offer letter.
Please have a look.

48:26.557 --> 48:28.499
We can meet up front.

48:28.557 --> 48:29.899
Thank you.
Excuse me.

48:32.493 --> 48:34.332
Thank you.
Does not matter.

48:38.318 --> 48:41.265
He said there was a farm
in Guasca...

48:41.940 --> 48:45.039
...and they have a similar cooler.

48:48.793 --> 48:50.499
I can take you there.

48:51.333 --> 48:53.265
Good, thank you.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.499
But it's a two hour trip, right?

48:58.594 --> 48:59.666
Ya.

49:00.033 --> 49:01.665
But I can drive fast.

49:06.375 --> 49:09.165
I don't think I can afford it.

49:16.796 --> 49:18.232
I can help you pay.

49:21.665 --> 49:24.865
I want to help you buy a
cooler for your orchid.

49:33.139 --> 49:34.233
Why?

49:36.187 --> 49:38.565
I've always wanted
a big cooler.

49:48.547 --> 49:50.065
I have some savings.

49:57.375 --> 49:59.965
Are you offering me a loan?

50:01.066 --> 50:02.499
Not really.

50:08.478 --> 50:09.699
So what?

50:12.749 --> 50:14.865
For a farm in Medellin?

50:18.241 --> 50:19.333
Why not?

50:22.964 --> 50:24.932
Shall we go back to the shop?

51:33.952 --> 51:36.107
What do you mean?

51:37.460 --> 51:39.099
Protect me from what?

51:40.066 --> 51:42.532
Probably from the way you work.

51:43.640 --> 51:47.932
Your relationship with your job.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.365
Or leave..
Hi!

51:55.017 --> 51:56.017
Hi!

51:56.072 --> 51:57.660
Hi.

51:58.310 --> 52:02.120
I didn't expect to meet you,
what a sweet surprise.

52:02.152 --> 52:03.295
Hei.

52:04.306 --> 52:05.630
What do you want to drink?

52:05.655 --> 52:06.678
How are you?

52:06.703 --> 52:08.076
Very good.

52:08.496 --> 52:09.726
Baguslah.Yes.

52:09.925 --> 52:11.433
I'm out today.

52:12.901 --> 52:16.015
Andres kept saying that he
would meet me at the hospital...

52:16.040 --> 52:17.499
...so I have to
get up quickly.

52:17.500 --> 52:18.563
Who?

52:19.143 --> 52:20.230
Andres.

52:20.389 --> 52:21.841
He texts me every night.

52:21.866 --> 52:23.132
Good evening.

52:23.533 --> 52:25.799
Hello. Thank you.

52:27.239 --> 52:28.644
Which Andres?

52:29.112 --> 52:30.239
Dentist.

52:31.850 --> 52:34.667
Andres the Dentist
died last year.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.910
No, Jessica,
she's alive and well.

52:37.935 --> 52:39.006
Yes.

52:42.779 --> 52:44.565
What do you eat?
What's good here?

52:44.959 --> 52:47.109
This ossobuco is delicious.
Really?

52:47.166 --> 52:48.435
- Want a taste?
- Yes.

52:48.460 --> 52:50.309
Leftovers on your fork.

52:53.936 --> 52:55.586
Delicious.

52:59.790 --> 53:02.732
I mean, the way you work.
Your relationship to the job.

53:02.797 --> 53:08.765
If you can put some distance...
or a different mindset.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.841
Or leave it.
Leave your job.

53:11.866 --> 53:13.799
No, I will not leave my job.

53:18.689 --> 53:21.125
Why did he have to change jobs?

53:23.839 --> 53:28.824
With our local search team,
our current job...

53:29.584 --> 53:32.390
...is investigating
a tribe...

53:32.671 --> 53:35.266
... who lives in the middle of the Amazon jungle.

53:36.199 --> 53:38.763
They are called
inland people.

53:39.316 --> 53:41.719
They are unreachable...

53:41.744 --> 53:43.554
...they choose
to be unreachable.

53:43.684 --> 53:45.607
But people also believe
they are dangerous...

53:45.629 --> 53:49.594
...so people
never approach them.

53:50.350 --> 53:53.286
We heard that the elder of the tribe...

53:53.429 --> 53:56.375
...at night,
they sit together...

53:56.400 --> 54:00.469
...and with their minds,
they started to make some sort of...

54:00.839 --> 54:02.766
I don't know what it's called...
Like a spell?

54:02.791 --> 54:04.930
Yes. Right, like a spell...

54:05.166 --> 54:07.448
...to intercept people
from approaching them.

54:08.261 --> 54:11.994
Juan thinks that's
what makes me sick.

54:15.671 --> 54:17.234
So you think...

54:17.962 --> 54:20.869
...that has nothing to do
with the dog?

54:21.539 --> 54:22.798
What dog?

54:24.606 --> 54:25.862
You remember?

54:25.927 --> 54:28.202
The dog you told me about?

54:29.386 --> 54:31.591
Oh, that dog!
Of course.

54:32.448 --> 54:34.233
Right, it could be the dog.

54:34.336 --> 54:38.366
It could be that dog or that tribe.
Can be anything.

54:38.391 --> 54:42.961
Tell me about a man who wanted to
build a road in the forest.

54:42.986 --> 54:44.065
Tell me what happened to him.

54:44.159 --> 54:49.281
Yes.. there is someone
who wants to build a road...

54:49.306 --> 54:52.947
...to traverse the Amazon
from end to end...

54:52.972 --> 54:55.772
...so he wanted to cut down the trees,...

54:55.797 --> 54:58.144
...for easy access...

54:58.145 --> 55:00.732
...because he's
trading illegally.

55:00.757 --> 55:03.948
Animal skins,
plants, and so on.

55:03.968 --> 55:05.960
He gathered
a group of people...

55:06.138 --> 55:08.931
...to help him
build this road.

55:09.357 --> 55:10.729
Then..

55:14.189 --> 55:15.356
Yes?

55:16.435 --> 55:18.530
They started building roads...

55:18.827 --> 55:20.974
...and they start to get deeper...

55:20.999 --> 55:24.939
...but when it reached a point,
the people who helped him,...

55:24.958 --> 55:27.259
...doesn't want to work anymore
then left.

55:27.402 --> 55:30.086
So, they left ..

55:30.111 --> 55:33.133
The other thing he wanted to do
was colonize those people...

55:33.216 --> 55:35.554
...so he stayed...

55:35.579 --> 55:37.774
...and continue with one person.
With his sister.

55:37.856 --> 55:40.805
The two of them went inside, then disappeared.
They disappeared.

55:41.725 --> 55:43.336
Ya, ya.

55:43.918 --> 55:46.845
They both disappeared, no one
knows if they are still alive or not.

55:46.870 --> 55:48.925
I think they're dead.

55:49.013 --> 55:50.140
According to me.

55:50.325 --> 55:52.428
They were probably dead,
of course.

55:55.920 --> 55:59.442
So, I don't know. But I didn't really
go in there, did I?

55:59.467 --> 56:01.300
I was just investigating...

56:01.625 --> 56:05.109
...about the tribe.
- But you made contact.

56:07.495 --> 56:08.924
Not really.

56:09.690 --> 56:11.849
But you did make contact.

56:12.448 --> 56:14.284
With the stories you investigated.

56:14.367 --> 56:16.454
I still don't know
what to order.

56:19.039 --> 56:20.632
The menu is big.

56:22.200 --> 56:25.532
What are you drawing, honey?
Orange?

56:26.885 --> 56:31.117
No, this...

56:32.250 --> 56:33.965
Grapefruit.
Yes.

56:34.004 --> 56:37.628
Really grapefruit?
- It's from the book I gave him.

56:37.922 --> 56:40.665
Tomorrow we are going to the market
to buy grapefruit.

56:40.690 --> 56:42.532
But they can't talk.

56:42.557 --> 56:44.665
He's not three years old anymore, Juan.

56:44.674 --> 56:47.682
Is there a grapefruit dish
on the menu?

56:47.811 --> 56:49.412
Nothing, Jess.

56:52.420 --> 56:54.761
I think I'll
just order the ossobuco.

56:55.752 --> 56:56.983
Good.

56:59.746 --> 57:03.496
Are you going to practice
with the others tomorrow?

57:03.888 --> 57:06.516
Yes of course.
I have to go back...

57:06.947 --> 57:09.371
...as soon as possible,
since I'm out for a few days.

57:09.923 --> 57:12.612
We have little time
to prepare.

57:12.899 --> 57:14.759
You're all right, right?

57:21.130 --> 57:22.606
Who knows.

58:32.780 --> 58:34.199
Excuse me.

58:34.351 --> 58:35.899
Is Hernan here?

58:36.550 --> 58:37.665
Hernan?

58:38.375 --> 58:42.099
Hernan, audio engineer...

58:43.232 --> 58:45.065
...who works upstairs?

58:46.846 --> 58:48.265
In the <i>mixing</i> room ?

58:48.401 --> 58:51.032
No, no one named Hernan
works there.

58:52.274 --> 58:56.632
What do you mean Pablo?
In the <i>mix</i> , there is Pablo or Luis.

59:02.166 --> 59:03.332
Thank you.

59:08.815 --> 59:11.499
He is about 30 years old.

59:11.958 --> 59:14.699
No, almost 30 years.

59:17.088 --> 59:19.298
About this high.

59:19.929 --> 59:21.399
Short brown hair.

59:23.294 --> 59:24.565
Do you have the picture?

59:26.459 --> 59:27.798
No.

59:37.698 --> 59:39.665
Forget it. Thank you.

59:39.793 --> 59:40.933
All right.

1:07:13.604 --> 1:07:16.798
The excavation site is
still a bit down.

1:08:59.462 --> 1:09:00.632
Depth..

1:09:01.010 --> 1:09:02.465
31.

1:09:03.923 --> 1:09:05.332
35.

1:09:06.708 --> 1:09:08.932
And bone size..

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:13.332
39 centimeters long.

1:10:12.993 --> 1:10:15.024
You hear that bell ringing?

1:10:18.878 --> 1:10:20.596
Animal bell.

1:10:30.438 --> 1:10:32.541
I think I'm going crazy.

1:10:35.556 --> 1:10:37.016
You?

1:10:37.827 --> 1:10:39.341
I also.

1:10:42.145 --> 1:10:44.327
That's not the worst thing.

1:10:58.499 --> 1:11:00.284
I composed a poem!

1:11:02.638 --> 1:11:03.911
Poetry...

1:11:04.142 --> 1:11:05.808
...about sleepless nights.

1:11:13.068 --> 1:11:15.013
Beyond the petals...

1:11:17.168 --> 1:11:19.668
... and fast-waving wings ...

1:11:26.442 --> 1:11:28.631
...the wind blows...

1:11:30.175 --> 1:11:32.770
... and fade the shadows.

1:11:38.988 --> 1:11:40.131
Next?

1:11:43.050 --> 1:11:44.502
Only that.

1:12:04.021 --> 1:12:05.159
See.

1:12:38.074 --> 1:12:39.565
Do you feel pain?

1:12:44.279 --> 1:12:46.332
Sometimes, when it's high,...

1:12:47.066 --> 1:12:51.365
...blood pressure can make
a popping sound.

1:12:52.764 --> 1:12:54.799
It was not a popping sound.

1:12:54.851 --> 1:12:56.499
Not a popping sound?

1:12:59.510 --> 1:13:01.532
What kind of pillow are you using?

1:13:02.002 --> 1:13:06.065
I wear different ones
because I travel a lot.

1:13:08.415 --> 1:13:10.899
You must wear an orthopedic pillow.

1:13:11.865 --> 1:13:14.232
To travel.
Yes, maybe.

1:13:16.452 --> 1:13:18.232
Do you sleep well?

1:13:19.103 --> 1:13:20.532
I don't sleep.

1:13:21.780 --> 1:13:23.732
You're not sleeping?

1:13:29.585 --> 1:13:32.099
Maybe it was a hallucination.

1:13:32.785 --> 1:13:33.999
I don't think so.

1:13:36.706 --> 1:13:42.065
Whether your father, mother,
or any other family member...

1:13:42.148 --> 1:13:45.199
...have a medical problem?

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:47.465
Mental health problems?

1:13:53.187 --> 1:13:54.297
Not.

1:13:58.066 --> 1:13:59.599
And your husband?

1:14:07.935 --> 1:14:12.199
In this city, there are many people
who suffer from hallucinations.

1:14:17.757 --> 1:14:20.965
Maybe I just need something
to relax?

1:14:24.678 --> 1:14:26.065
Pil?

1:14:29.041 --> 1:14:31.399
You asked me for Xanax?

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:35.832
No, no.

1:14:38.566 --> 1:14:39.832
Perhaps, yes.

1:14:43.278 --> 1:14:47.465
This type of drug is quite addictive.

1:14:49.395 --> 1:14:51.999
Not a real healer.

1:14:52.577 --> 1:14:55.365
Judging from you, I guess...

1:14:55.901 --> 1:14:58.532
...you can get addicted.

1:14:59.639 --> 1:15:00.646
Why?

1:15:00.671 --> 1:15:01.899
Anyway ...

1:15:02.417 --> 1:15:04.632
...that will make you lose empathy.

1:15:05.231 --> 1:15:08.532
You will no longer be moved
by the beauty of this world.

1:15:10.612 --> 1:15:13.132
Or the sorrow of this world.

1:15:16.619 --> 1:15:18.799
Jesus is with you.

1:15:24.227 --> 1:15:25.366
Read.

1:15:33.174 --> 1:15:35.332
You know Salvador Dali?

1:15:36.285 --> 1:15:37.321
Yes?

1:15:38.809 --> 1:15:41.399
There is a picture of him
on display at the reception.

1:15:41.424 --> 1:15:42.599
I saw it.

1:15:44.633 --> 1:15:48.065
Salvador Dali understands the
beauty of our world.

1:15:53.587 --> 1:15:54.899
But...

1:15:55.190 --> 1:15:57.732
...don't you think
he consumed something?

1:15:59.578 --> 1:16:02.383
No, I don't think so.

1:16:03.843 --> 1:16:05.599
Certainly not.

1:18:35.518 --> 1:18:36.812
Are you okay?

1:19:36.695 --> 1:19:38.699
I know where you live.

1:19:40.336 --> 1:19:41.400
Time?

1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:45.632
At Eduardo's house.

1:19:49.466 --> 1:19:51.232
His father used to run a cinema.

1:19:55.279 --> 1:19:56.965
His brother is a detective.

1:20:20.106 --> 1:20:22.465
Are you the anthropologist
from Bogota?

1:20:23.074 --> 1:20:25.932
No, I was just passing through.

1:20:26.178 --> 1:20:27.665
I live in Medellin.

1:20:34.547 --> 1:20:36.632
I never leave this town.

1:20:37.531 --> 1:20:38.572
Never?

1:20:43.988 --> 1:20:45.865
I remember everything.

1:20:46.655 --> 1:20:48.965
Jadi aku mencoba membatasi
apa yang kulihat.

1:20:55.110 --> 1:20:59.032
Makanya aku tak pernah menonton
film atau televisi.

1:21:01.596 --> 1:21:04.399
Kau melewatkan beberapa hal bagus.

1:21:07.319 --> 1:21:08.400
Seperti apa?

1:21:11.301 --> 1:21:12.899
Seperti olahraga.

1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:15.765
Sepak bola.

1:21:20.156 --> 1:21:22.765
Kurasa sepak bola
tidak akan membantuku.

1:21:24.982 --> 1:21:26.532
Mungkin musik?

1:21:27.432 --> 1:21:28.799
Berita.

1:21:30.456 --> 1:21:32.399
Acara memasak.

1:21:33.329 --> 1:21:34.865
Miss Universe.

1:21:39.196 --> 1:21:41.265
Sudah banyak kisah saja.

1:21:50.046 --> 1:21:51.532
Seperti batu ini..

1:21:59.238 --> 1:22:00.832
Aku mendengar seseorang.

1:22:05.166 --> 1:22:06.865
Dia istirahat makan siang.

1:22:11.058 --> 1:22:13.499
Dua orang temannya memukulnya...

1:22:14.137 --> 1:22:15.999
...dan mencuri liontinnya.

1:22:20.009 --> 1:22:21.399
Salah satu dari mereka berkata,...

1:22:22.096 --> 1:22:23.165
..."Hei.. Psst!

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.465
Ayo ambil makanannya juga.

1:22:26.595 --> 1:22:28.032
Kelihatannya lezat."

1:22:32.198 --> 1:22:34.632
Mereka mengambil tasnya dan kabur.

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:42.499
Dia dihajar lagi,
karena mengikuti mereka.

1:22:43.811 --> 1:22:45.299
Kau mengenalnya?

1:22:46.042 --> 1:22:47.105
Tidak.

1:22:49.557 --> 1:22:52.599
Itu terjadi dahulu sekali,
tapi getarannya...

1:22:54.364 --> 1:22:56.980
...tertanam di sini, di batu ini.

1:23:15.262 --> 1:23:18.599
Batu ini adalah bagian dari batu besar
yang dia duduki.

1:23:23.388 --> 1:23:26.132
Bebatuan, pepohonan, beton...

1:23:26.237 --> 1:23:28.299
...mereka menyerap semuanya.

1:23:29.982 --> 1:23:33.232
Aku juga bisa merasakan getaran
yang tersimpan di tubuhku.

1:23:35.879 --> 1:23:38.199
Aku ingat semua yang telah kumakan.

1:23:38.313 --> 1:23:40.299
Cuaca yang melanda kami setiap harinya.

1:23:43.322 --> 1:23:46.865
Gerakan tanganku ini,
pada ikan ini.

1:23:49.329 --> 1:23:51.199
Kusadari...

1:23:53.632 --> 1:23:56.265
Aku tak berkeinginan untuk
pergi ke mana pun.

1:23:59.569 --> 1:24:01.532
Pengalaman itu berbahaya.

1:24:08.213 --> 1:24:11.432
Pengalaman melepaskan kebingungan ganas
di kenanganku.

1:24:14.724 --> 1:24:16.665
Jadi aku menanam tumbuh-tumbuhan.

1:24:17.486 --> 1:24:18.865
Aku membersihkan sisik ikan.

1:24:30.227 --> 1:24:31.465
Bolehkah?

1:24:45.605 --> 1:24:46.700
Terima kasih.

1:24:57.914 --> 1:24:59.665
Aku Jessica.

1:25:00.316 --> 1:25:01.499
Hernan.

1:25:25.045 --> 1:25:27.065
It is a howler monkey.

1:25:33.373 --> 1:25:35.799
Their leader is not happy.

1:25:39.081 --> 1:25:42.132
He wanted to leave,
but the others refused.

1:25:45.429 --> 1:25:47.841
Do you understand monkey language?

1:25:47.921 --> 1:25:49.024
Ya.

1:25:52.566 --> 1:25:55.765
In a few minutes, the
sun will hit the mountain.

1:26:05.366 --> 1:26:06.899
I remember...

1:26:10.612 --> 1:26:12.265
...space.

1:26:14.146 --> 1:26:15.765
We are looking for...

1:26:18.100 --> 1:26:19.532
...then I was born.

1:26:23.058 --> 1:26:25.099
I don't seem to understand.

1:26:28.264 --> 1:26:30.499
We were previously in outer space
with the others.

1:26:33.837 --> 1:26:35.599
I saw two lovebirds,...

1:26:36.313 --> 1:26:37.932
...and I was born.

1:26:54.766 --> 1:26:57.832
This is a fine human invention.

1:26:59.718 --> 1:27:01.032
What is it?

1:27:01.321 --> 1:27:03.299
Some pills.

1:27:03.613 --> 1:27:07.899
I managed to get it
from a hard-to-ask doctor.

1:27:09.383 --> 1:27:11.632
I think you will like this pill.

1:27:18.008 --> 1:27:19.799
But isn't that yours?

1:27:21.526 --> 1:27:23.665
I don't think that will help me.

1:27:40.986 --> 1:27:43.103
I heard a voice.

1:27:45.603 --> 1:27:50.832
But now I want to hear
more.

1:28:11.455 --> 1:28:13.132
That's weird.

1:28:17.798 --> 1:28:20.565
I only remember when I was a baby.

1:28:24.850 --> 1:28:26.965
My mom's blouse.

1:28:30.622 --> 1:28:34.532
My nose felt hot at that time.

1:28:39.304 --> 1:28:42.665
I heard a very loud voice.

1:28:44.955 --> 1:28:47.099
And I cried.

1:29:58.835 --> 1:30:01.899
You remember your dreams too?

1:30:04.915 --> 1:30:06.049
No.

1:30:08.142 --> 1:30:09.292
I..

1:30:14.268 --> 1:30:16.532
Our people never dream.

1:30:19.410 --> 1:30:21.432
What happens when you fall asleep?

1:30:25.542 --> 1:30:26.899
None.

1:30:34.552 --> 1:30:36.432
Can you show me?

1:30:38.136 --> 1:30:39.421
Now?

1:30:39.446 --> 1:30:41.199
Yes, sleep.

1:32:37.692 --> 1:32:38.733
Hernan?

1:37:31.619 --> 1:37:32.965
Would you like some water?

1:37:36.714 --> 1:37:38.082
No.

1:37:42.189 --> 1:37:43.599
How?

1:37:45.650 --> 1:37:47.324
What?

1:37:48.768 --> 1:37:50.565
Death.

1:37:56.339 --> 1:37:57.878
Not bad.

1:38:02.142 --> 1:38:03.832
I just stopped.

1:40:27.409 --> 1:40:30.065
That story is my favorite.

1:40:30.169 --> 1:40:31.573
Really?

1:40:32.645 --> 1:40:33.716
Yes.

1:40:37.719 --> 1:40:38.833
Sorry.

1:40:52.804 --> 1:40:54.465
Would you like it?
Yes.

1:40:57.066 --> 1:40:58.499
I made this myself.

1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:07.565
With my herbs.

1:41:08.919 --> 1:41:10.299
It feels so strong.

1:41:26.807 --> 1:41:30.132
This brings me close
to what you call a dream.

1:41:32.236 --> 1:41:33.442
Ya.

1:41:34.652 --> 1:41:36.965
Another great human invention,...

1:41:38.017 --> 1:41:39.965
...even made by you.

1:41:52.861 --> 1:41:54.065
Can I?

1:41:56.853 --> 1:41:57.965
Ya.

1:42:30.203 --> 1:42:31.499
Be careful.

1:42:32.036 --> 1:42:34.132
You see the stain in the corner?

1:42:34.425 --> 1:42:35.832
That's my blood.

1:42:36.433 --> 1:42:38.632
The knife is from the blender.

1:44:27.734 --> 1:44:32.632
At that time I was hiding under the bed.

1:44:36.786 --> 1:44:38.865
With others.

1:44:43.882 --> 1:44:46.832
We can hear everything.

1:44:52.318 --> 1:44:54.532
They are looking for us.

1:45:01.065 --> 1:45:04.565
They searched for us all night.

1:45:21.427 --> 1:45:23.265
I'm here.

1:45:43.575 --> 1:45:46.732
The blanket is also blue.

1:45:53.626 --> 1:45:55.565
My mother...

1:45:56.706 --> 1:46:01.832
He touched and straightened my fingers,
one by one.

1:46:04.709 --> 1:46:08.832
He put my palm
to his lips.

1:46:14.659 --> 1:46:18.165
I leaned my head against the pillow.

1:46:20.675 --> 1:46:25.499
I moved my head
from side to side.

1:46:29.700 --> 1:46:31.965
My nose is burning.

1:46:34.349 --> 1:46:36.699
The skin is peeling off.

1:46:43.890 --> 1:46:47.432
Shadows on the ceiling.

1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:08.599
You read my memory.

1:47:22.260 --> 1:47:24.632
I'm like a hard disk.

1:47:35.268 --> 1:47:37.132
And somehow...

1:47:41.394 --> 1:47:43.665
...you are the antenna.

1:48:02.408 --> 1:48:04.265
It was dark.

1:48:07.456 --> 1:48:12.365
It was 4 in the morning, and I had to pee,
but I couldn't.

1:48:17.586 --> 1:48:21.299
So I went there, under the bed.

1:48:38.261 --> 1:48:40.899
I'm not here, am I?

1:48:52.826 --> 1:48:53.826
No.

1:49:01.472 --> 1:49:02.699
I'm here.

1:49:54.657 --> 1:49:56.399
Why are you crying?

1:50:03.048 --> 1:50:05.432
That's not your memory.

1:50:24.278 --> 1:50:26.132
This sound...

1:50:28.476 --> 1:50:30.765
...I keep hearing it.

1:50:34.492 --> 1:50:36.232
Is that your memory too?

1:51:10.096 --> 1:51:11.399
Ya.

1:51:23.339 --> 1:51:26.032
But that was before our time.

1:53:31.902 --> 1:53:35.032
<i>Let's get some food too.
It looks delicious.</i>

1:53:35.394 --> 1:53:37.732
<i>No, don't do it.</i>

1:53:39.990 --> 1:53:41.799
<i>Stop it.</i>

1:53:42.370 --> 1:53:44.704
You <i>bastard!</i>

1:56:15.934 --> 1:56:17.418
<i>Wait!</i>

1:56:18.093 --> 1:56:19.338
<i>Come on!</i>

1:56:23.327 --> 1:56:25.127
<i>There, to the streets.</i>

2:02:20.287 --> 2:02:25.299
<i>The earthquake at the Machin Volcano
10 km away, was at level 2,...</i>

2:02:25.454 --> 2:02:27.098
<i>...</i> 2km <i>down.</i>

2:02:28.494 --> 2:02:33.465
<i>Acoustic Surveillance System,
3 km down, reports at level 3.</i>

2:02:35.481 --> 2:02:38.144
<i>Colombian Institute of Archaeology and History
in Bogota...</i>

2:02:38.169 --> 2:02:40.139
<i>...was notified.</i>

2:02:41.322 --> 2:02:43.305
<i>And the search for the location of the rock debris...</i>

2:02:43.330 --> 2:02:46.899
<i>...was proposed last week
by Santiago Andres Gomez.</i>

2:02:48.750 --> 2:02:51.565
<i>The pile is dumped
in the tunnel dump.</i>

2:02:53.730 --> 2:02:55.932
<i>But I didn't see it
with my own eyes.</i>

2:02:58.254 --> 2:03:01.865
<i>The rocks may contain
traces of arsenic and copper...</i>

2:03:01.952 --> 2:03:05.399
<i>...if it rains,
it can lead to water contamination...</i>

2:03:05.467 --> 2:03:07.299
<i>...in the bottom area.</i>

2:03:10.559 --> 2:03:13.232
A <i>grave with the remains of two people.</i>

2:03:13.328 --> 2:03:16.699
<i>And bones from
unidentified animals .</i>

2:03:17.376 --> 2:03:20.932
<i>There are no signs of equipment,
or they are disassembled.</i>

2:03:24.881 --> 2:03:28.199
<i>Unfortunately, one of his skulls was crushed
by the tunneling machine,...</i>

2:03:28.237 --> 2:03:30.932
<i>...along with possibly
some body parts.</i>

2:03:32.490 --> 2:03:36.065
<i>From the parts, it is not clear
whether the skull was perforated.</i>

2:03:37.893 --> 2:03:41.665
<i>We removed
the sixth and seventh left ribs.</i>
