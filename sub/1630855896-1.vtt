[celia pants]

01:00:46.902 --> 01:00:48.226
How did you find me?

01:00:52.465 --> 01:00:53.774
Where is she?

01:00:54.393 --> 01:00:55.859
Where's evie?

01:01:00.248 --> 01:01:01.448
Tell me she's alive.

01:01:02.142 --> 01:01:03.450
What happened to your head?

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:08.372
Your brother came after me.

01:01:15.914 --> 01:01:17.338
[sighs]

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.634
I've let this go too far.

01:01:20.669 --> 01:01:22.135
Celia: This restaurant.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.522
It was your family's?

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:28.558
Yes, it belonged to my father.

01:01:30.662 --> 01:01:34.414
He was a-- a very proud man

01:01:34.449 --> 01:01:38.068
And then when the customers
stopped coming, he, um...

01:01:39.538 --> 01:01:41.238
Well, he started drinking...

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:45.024
And he kept on drinking
and drinking,

01:01:45.026 --> 01:01:48.787
Until eventually,
it drowned him.

01:01:49.856 --> 01:01:52.499
Leaving all his debt to you

01:01:52.534 --> 01:01:54.217
And your brother, renzo.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:57.087
He is the one with the talent.

01:01:57.122 --> 01:02:01.049
Me, I inherited
none of my father's craft...

01:02:01.868 --> 01:02:04.611
Only his pathetic charm.

01:02:04.646 --> 01:02:07.806
[somber music playing]

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.815
That day at the station...

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.776
Why did you choose me?

01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:24.698
People that can afford
to go to these schools...

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.367
They tend to come from money.

01:02:29.062 --> 01:02:32.622
But then you realized
evie was the bigger prize?

01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:38.628
[scoffs]

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.885

01:02:54.279 --> 01:02:55.562
Hello?

01:02:58.508 --> 01:02:59.691
Rosabella?

01:03:05.132 --> 01:03:06.364
<i> Rosa: Izzy.</i>

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.685
I've been trying to reach celia.

01:03:10.762 --> 01:03:12.787
I haven't heard from her
since yesterday,

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.206
I've been worried sick.

01:03:14.933 --> 01:03:16.917
And I know she paid you a visit.

01:03:17.802 --> 01:03:19.419
She's-- she's gone.

01:03:20.038 --> 01:03:21.137
<i> Izzy: Where did she go?</i>

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:23.540
Why isn't she answering
my calls?

01:03:23.575 --> 01:03:26.009
[heavy breathing]

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:29.513
She's in trouble, isn't she?

01:03:32.067 --> 01:03:33.716
Rosa, listen to me.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.520
What happened between us,
it's far behind us.

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:38.914
Whatever's happening now,

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:41.274
You are the only one there
who can help.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.110
What-- what-- what...

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.364
What if I'm not enough?

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.329
I said so many things
I regret back then, but...

01:03:55.148 --> 01:03:57.256
What I regret most is

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.151
How it turned
the two of you into strangers.

01:04:00.228 --> 01:04:03.588
<i> The two dearest people</i>
<i> in my world.</i>

01:04:04.216 --> 01:04:06.716
I need to know you're both okay.

01:04:11.907 --> 01:04:14.057
Well, I will make sure of it.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.561
I promise.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.037
What good's it going to do
if you just spend

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.606
The rest of your lives
on the run?

01:04:29.682 --> 01:04:32.683
No, no renzo, he says
that we can change our names

01:04:32.761 --> 01:04:36.246
And, I don't know,
start again somewhere else.

01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:39.132
He is the main suspect

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:42.794
In the disappearance
of another student last month.

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:45.130
[scoffs]

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:48.008

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:51.094
I... [laughs nervously]

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:54.330
Okay, he, um,

01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:57.392
He told me
it was an-- an accident.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.689
Okay, look.

01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:07.318
My brother has no intention
of letting evie go.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.029
He is going to make her...

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.448
Disappear.

01:05:12.968 --> 01:05:14.117
No, no, no.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:17.728
What-- you-- you can't--

01:05:17.806 --> 01:05:19.489
There's still time, okay?

01:05:19.565 --> 01:05:22.500
You-- you have to tell me
where she is!

01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:27.405
Okay, look, if I, um--

01:05:27.482 --> 01:05:30.574
Look, if I--
if I take you to her--

01:05:30.652 --> 01:05:33.169
Look, you have to
promise me no police.

01:05:33.246 --> 01:05:34.971
You have to promise me
that you'll let me try

01:05:35.006 --> 01:05:37.932
And talk to dante to--
to try and get through to him

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.184
One-- one last time.

01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:42.187
Okay.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.982
Just take me to her now.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.069
[thudding]

01:05:51.597 --> 01:05:53.365
- You brought others.
- Celia: No.

01:05:54.176 --> 01:05:55.992
- No, I came on my own.
- You...

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.429
You brought the police!

01:05:59.464 --> 01:06:01.388
You lied to me! You betrayed me!

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.108
Listen to me,
I'm telling you the truth.

01:06:04.186 --> 01:06:07.520
I came here
to find evie on my own.

01:06:07.555 --> 01:06:10.173
Yeah, well it's too late
for that now.

01:06:11.042 --> 01:06:13.009
It's too late for everything.

[breathing shakily]

01:06:19.634 --> 01:06:22.227

Aunt rosa, what are you doing?

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:30.743
- Oh, I just had to come.
- Here, here.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.896
Celia, I wanted to help,

01:06:33.973 --> 01:06:35.139
But I-- I fell--

01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:37.033
- Oh, god.
- Hey, I got you.

01:06:39.145 --> 01:06:41.070
Yeah, we'll clean you up,
come inside.

Is evie here? Did you find her?

01:06:43.758 --> 01:06:46.317
[sighs] no, she's still gone.

01:06:46.427 --> 01:06:48.712
- She's not here.
- I'm sorry.

[door clicks closed]

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.572
Rosa: I don't think I'm cut out

01:06:59.607 --> 01:07:01.850
For this cloak and dagger stuff.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.563
You should have gone
after him and left me.

01:07:06.598 --> 01:07:10.775
No. You're hurt.
I can't leave you.

01:07:12.287 --> 01:07:15.530
I'm so sorry, celia.
I'm nothing but a curse to you.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.409
After all these years,
you finally see me as I am.

01:07:29.354 --> 01:07:30.962
I was 24.

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:35.875
I was in my last year
of art college...

01:07:36.536 --> 01:07:38.278
Trying to finish
my final painting

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.554
On a deadline...

01:07:41.049 --> 01:07:43.307
But everything
was going wrong that night,

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:47.228
Even the power was out,
because of a-- a nasty storm.

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.672
And that was the night

01:07:49.749 --> 01:07:53.109
Your mom
finally asked me to babysit.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:58.364
- I don't remember.
- You were quite young.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.624
When you were sleeping I, um...

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.294
I went to check on you and...

01:08:12.497 --> 01:08:13.880
To kiss you good night...

01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:18.802
But...

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.640
But... [sobs]

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.102
But what?

01:08:32.258 --> 01:08:36.194
I left my candle
on the bed table...

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:39.614
When I kissed your cheek.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.493
[sighs]

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.373
A breeze blew in
from the storm...

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:52.836
And...

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:58.675
The drapes, they...

01:09:01.012 --> 01:09:02.728
They caught fire.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.097
[rosa sniffs]

01:09:05.717 --> 01:09:10.186
To this day,
I don't know what came first.

01:09:12.507 --> 01:09:15.525
Remembering I left
the candle by your bed...

01:09:17.045 --> 01:09:18.636
Or hearing the alarm.

01:09:18.713 --> 01:09:21.406
[rosa sobbing]

01:09:25.144 --> 01:09:26.911
Aunt rosa.

01:09:28.223 --> 01:09:30.164
You could've died.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.499
You-- [cries]

01:09:32.878 --> 01:09:34.294
You could've died.

01:09:36.748 --> 01:09:38.590
But I didn't die.

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.843
I'm here, I'm fine.

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:47.423
What?

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.018
And mom never forgave you?

01:09:50.912 --> 01:09:53.730
Oh, she did eventually.

01:09:54.749 --> 01:09:56.649
But I couldn't forgive myself.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:09:59.903
I couldn't face anything.

01:10:00.772 --> 01:10:02.447
I ran away.

01:10:04.275 --> 01:10:05.608
[sniffling]

01:10:05.685 --> 01:10:06.910
Mom...

01:10:07.929 --> 01:10:11.164
Had just said
that you left to find yourself.

01:10:11.866 --> 01:10:13.416
You think I left my...

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:15.960
My home, my family...

01:10:16.938 --> 01:10:19.839
Traveled halfway around
the world to find myself?

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.133
No. [scoffs]

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.096
No, I came here to hide.

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:31.935
And then,

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.811
Out of the blue...

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.732
You show up at my door.

01:10:38.718 --> 01:10:43.112
I thought maybe this time
I could make it right.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.909
[celia chuckles]

01:10:49.137 --> 01:10:50.453
You have.

01:10:52.898 --> 01:10:54.207
You have.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.408
I guess I always knew

01:11:04.486 --> 01:11:06.970
That one day
I would end up at your door.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.139
Oh, celia.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.810
Thank you.

01:11:21.185 --> 01:11:22.527
Wait a minute.

01:11:24.705 --> 01:11:26.447
- Celia: Hmm?
- Just wait.

01:11:29.677 --> 01:11:30.827
Celia: What?

01:11:33.698 --> 01:11:36.182
I recognize
this-- this warehouse.

01:11:36.217 --> 01:11:38.710
You think that's where
they're keeping evie?

01:11:39.612 --> 01:11:42.213
I'm not sure,
but it's not far from here.

01:11:44.109 --> 01:11:45.925
Then if you're up for it...

01:11:49.397 --> 01:11:50.847
Let's go find out.

01:11:57.296 --> 01:11:58.438
<i> Matteo: Renzo?</i>

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.232
Renzo?

Matteo.

01:12:41.766 --> 01:12:42.982
Evie.

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.028
Hey. Wait. What are you doing?

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.589
Uh, I'm letting you go.

01:12:49.624 --> 01:12:52.441
Letting me go?
Is-- is the ransom paid?

01:12:52.518 --> 01:12:53.776
No, no, no, no.

01:12:53.853 --> 01:12:55.536
It's too late
for that now, okay?

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:56.946
Too late?

01:12:57.022 --> 01:12:59.165
So, why--
why are you freeing me?

01:12:59.784 --> 01:13:01.125
[evie groans]

01:13:02.319 --> 01:13:05.838
Look, because if I--
look, if I don't...

01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:09.509
My brother,
he's going to kill you.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.795
All right.

01:13:15.466 --> 01:13:18.684
- What's wrong?
- Oh, um...

He, uh...

01:13:21.547 --> 01:13:24.399
He said--
he said it was ketamine.

01:13:27.462 --> 01:13:28.902
I'm sorry.

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:31.738
Listen, let me, um--
let me help you, okay?

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.149
- Yeah.
- Okay, you okay?

01:13:33.225 --> 01:13:35.952
- Yeah. [groans]
- matteo: It's just this way.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.513
Renzo, what do you have?

01:13:56.491 --> 01:13:58.516
