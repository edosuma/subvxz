WEBVTT

02:57.845 --> 02:59.411
Can I help you, love?

02:59.413 --> 03:00.612
I made a reservation.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.248
Mrs. Wright, yeah?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.716
Yeah.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.852
Righto. Single person occupancy
for two nights,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.820
breakfast included,
correct-a-mundo?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.556
I requested a twin bed.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.424
Ah, you did.
I have to warn you though.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.560
Extra guests
do incur a surcharge.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.694
I understand.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.197
Hey, you might get lucky. Ha!

03:18.199 --> 03:21.633
Oh, room 531.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.835
Bridal suite.
Best view in the house.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.271
See? Lucky already.
Shall I show you up?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.406
No, thanks. I can manage.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.874
- Sure?
- Yeah.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.212
Well, your funeral.
Anyway, welcome to Scarborough.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.348
I hope you enjoy your stay
at the Metropole.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.985
What floor?

04:12.987 --> 04:14.019
Fifth.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.887
That's a coincidence.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.565
So what room you get then?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.574
Is it sea-facing?

04:35.576 --> 04:38.677
Yeah.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.612
Can I see it?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.909
Jeez...

08:21.802 --> 08:24.970
That's not why
I brought you here.

08:24.972 --> 08:29.107
What'd you
bring me here for then?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.009
To talk.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.811
What's there to talk about?

08:32.813 --> 08:35.212
You know, us.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.282
What this is.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.217
Yeah, but I know what this is.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.650
What floor are you on?

09:45.652 --> 09:46.785
Fifth.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.188
That's a coincidence.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.770
<i>Door is closing.</i>

10:23.790 --> 10:26.124
So what room
did you get then?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.360
Is it sea-facing?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.934
Can I see it?

10:44.878 --> 10:46.878
That's not why
I brought you here.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.015
Why did you bring me here then?

10:50.017 --> 10:53.051
- To talk.
- What's there to talk about?

10:53.053 --> 10:54.919
You know, us.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.921
What this is.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.057
I know what this is.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.332
What are you doing? No.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.072
Leave it.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.235
Ouch.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.170
The state of me!

12:22.442 --> 12:24.943
You know you can't
show anyone.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.311
I'm not stupid.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.980
I know. It's just...

12:30.517 --> 12:31.850
I worry.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.853
Why? Don't you trust me?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.488
It's not that.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.289
I know.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.024
You could lose your job.

12:40.026 --> 12:43.061
It's much more serious
than that.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.431
If anybody says anything...

12:46.433 --> 12:49.300
I'm not going to tell anyone.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.070
Your secret is safe with me.

12:52.072 --> 12:56.141
But I do own you now.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.977
Yeah, I'm sure that weirdo
at reception suspects.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.378
Sod him!

13:00.380 --> 13:02.847
I'll give him something
to write home about.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.449
Oh, yes!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.785
Stop it!

13:06.787 --> 13:08.920
- Beth!
- Ohh!

13:08.922 --> 13:10.555
- Oh, yes!
- I'm serious.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.491
Shh!

13:13.493 --> 13:15.226
Listen.

13:15.228 --> 13:18.196
Promise you won't shout, hmm?

13:20.867 --> 13:22.967
- Oh, yes!
- Stop!

13:22.969 --> 13:24.569
Listen, I'm serious.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.137
Shh!

13:27.440 --> 13:30.375
Oww! Oww!

13:30.377 --> 13:32.177
Oww!

13:32.179 --> 13:33.244
Aah!

13:33.246 --> 13:34.412
Ohh!

13:36.183 --> 13:37.882
Aah!

13:37.884 --> 13:39.984
I'm sorry.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.979
Are you in a huff?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.380
No.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.489
Bear thinks you are.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.192
Yeah, well, Bear's wrong.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.162
Beth's got a lovely present
that will cheer you up.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.997
Oh! Oh!

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
Isn't it me supposed
to give you a present?

14:28.001 --> 14:30.335
My birthday's not till Sunday.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.372
Close your eyes.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.608
Close your eyes!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.917
Open.

14:51.892 --> 14:52.891
Is this a joke?

14:52.893 --> 14:54.025
Don't you like it?

14:54.027 --> 14:55.460
Beth!

14:55.462 --> 14:57.595
That's not the point.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.632
Where am I going to keep it?

15:00.634 --> 15:02.100
I don't know. School?

15:02.102 --> 15:05.069
Where? In my office?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.671
Sure.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.107
The office I share
with Mr. Bentley?

15:09.109 --> 15:12.543
The office I have tutorials in
with your classmates?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.412
- I didn't think about that.
- No.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.347
I'm always the one thinking.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.182
All right. Sorry!

15:18.184 --> 15:21.986
You never do.

15:21.988 --> 15:26.090
I'm the one planning,
risking everything.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.027
All right, stop it.
You're doing my head in.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.297
I don't care what people think.
I'm not ashamed.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.098
I'm not ashamed of you.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.333
I'm sorry, B.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.104
It's a lovely photo.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.341
You can keep it in a drawer.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.043
What would be the point?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.011
To look at.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.183
I'm sick of hiding.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.452
Then don't.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.619
Ouch! The state of me.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.425
You know you can't show anyone.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.594
Yeah, I know.
I'm not stupid.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.230
I know. It's just...
I worry.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.464
Why? You not trust me?

17:14.467 --> 17:16.099
It's not that.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.336
Yeah. I know you said
you'd lose your job.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.606
It's much more serious
than that.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.776
- If anyone said anything.
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.477
Secret's safe with me.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.480
But I do own you now.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.088
I'm sure the weirdo
at reception suspects.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.290
Sod him. I'll give him something
to write home about.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.661
Stop it.

17:43.663 --> 17:47.532
Daz!

17:47.534 --> 17:49.634
I'm serious!

17:49.636 --> 17:51.669
Promise you won't shout.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.773
I'm serious!

17:55.775 --> 17:57.341
Get off!

17:58.344 --> 17:59.344
Sorry, I...

18:21.501 --> 18:23.734
You in a huff?

18:23.736 --> 18:25.503
No.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.842
Deer thinks you are.

18:30.844 --> 18:34.212
- Well, Deer's wrong.
- Yeah, well...

18:34.214 --> 18:36.334
Daz's got a lovely present
to cheer you right up.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.420
Isn't it me supposed
to get you a present?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.288
Birthday's not till Sunday.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.492
Close your eyes.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.360
No, come on, close them.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.363
And keep 'em closed.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.838
Open.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.510
Is this a joke?

19:06.546 --> 19:09.147
What, you don't like it?

19:09.149 --> 19:11.549
Daz, that's not the point!
Where am I gonna keep it?

19:11.551 --> 19:13.184
Don't know. School?

19:16.456 --> 19:17.522
What, in my office?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.891
Yeah, sure.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.660
The office I share
with Mr. Lynch?

19:22.662 --> 19:26.364
The office I have tutorials in
with your classmates?

19:26.366 --> 19:28.666
- I hadn't thought of that.
- No, you don't.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.601
- Sorry.
- I'm always the one thinking.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.370
- Right.
- The one planning.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.739
I don't care what anyone thinks.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.541
I'm not ashamed.
I'm not ashamed of you.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.782
I'm sorry.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.817
It's a lovely photo.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.821
Look, you could just, you know,
keep it in a drawer.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.790
What would be the point?

19:52.792 --> 19:56.327
Well, to look at it.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.529
I'm sick of hiding.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.564
Well, don't.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.030
Pssst!

21:06.032 --> 21:08.032
Hey, start walking.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.834
- What?
- Just get moving now.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.870
Daz, what is it?

21:12.872 --> 21:14.639
- Just bumped into Mr. Scott.
- What?

21:14.641 --> 21:16.774
- Yeah, walking down the street.
- Did he see you?

21:16.776 --> 21:20.411
Yeah, he stopped and had a chat
like we go way back.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.046
Wanted to know
what I was doing here.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.948
- What did you say?
- I said I was with friends,

21:23.950 --> 21:25.516
but the look he gave...

21:25.518 --> 21:26.751
What look, like what?
Show me!

21:26.753 --> 21:29.353
Like... I don't know.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.455
I was on my way out of the
newsagents, and there he was.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.424
I right froze.
I was like, "Right, sir."

21:33.426 --> 21:34.792
I don't know. The look he gave.
He knows.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.460
He doesn't know.
He does. He knows.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.329
He doesn't know. He can't!

21:38.331 --> 21:40.898
No, he must know that I'm...
I'm only joking!

21:40.900 --> 21:43.334
Oh, you shit!
You little shit!

21:43.336 --> 21:46.003
Just getting back at you!

21:46.005 --> 21:48.005
- I can't believe you did that!
- Excuse me, sir.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.940
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.842
You'd better run for your life!

21:56.482 --> 21:58.049
That was not funny.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.954
That was properly mean.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.690
No!

22:05.692 --> 22:07.758
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.894
You fool!

22:09.896 --> 22:12.330
What would the headmaster
be doing in Scarborough?

22:12.332 --> 22:14.098
It's not funny!

22:14.100 --> 22:16.500
- Yeah, it is.
- It's not funny.

22:25.044 --> 22:29.647
- Oh, God!
- It was funny. It was.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.090
It's right beautiful.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.392
The sun is shining.
Sea birds are singing.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.861
Yeah. Headmaster's on the prowl.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.430
You're never going to believe
anything that I say ever again.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.431
Uh, no!

22:47.433 --> 22:48.666
- No?
- Nah.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.801
- Never?
- Never.

22:50.803 --> 22:54.538
What if I said that I loved you,
would you believe that?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.440
- Don't be stupid.
- I'm not.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.576
You are.

22:58.578 --> 23:02.713
Well, maybe I am, but it doesn't
mean I'm lying, does it?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.982
Can we change the subject,
please?

23:04.984 --> 23:08.552
Sure. Bye!

23:08.554 --> 23:09.787
Beth! Will you come...

23:16.696 --> 23:19.497
That's thoughtful of you.
Did you steal it?

23:19.499 --> 23:21.499
No. It was free.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.801
- Oh, yeah?
- I could pay though.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.069
Why? You got money?

23:25.071 --> 23:29.073
Yeah. Well, not here,
but yeah.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.176
Oh, right. I see.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.945
- Can you swing us a tenner?
- Oh, God!

23:34.947 --> 23:36.947
Come on.
You know I'm good for it.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.186
Go on, then.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.704
Oh, shit.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.514
See? That's a big bicep,
that is.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.016
Oh, get over yourself.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.852
I'll go again.
I'll get bigger this time.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.893
I'm just gonna continue...

24:25.832 --> 24:27.598
- Yay!
- Yeah!

24:29.569 --> 24:30.835
Ready.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.570
Get 1,000 now.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.209
Oh, what happened?

24:38.211 --> 24:40.010
Well, uh, next time.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.713
I could do better
if I wanted to.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.948
We could...

24:43.950 --> 24:45.850
- We could...
- What about that?

24:45.852 --> 24:47.952
- We should go.
- Go on.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.790
I think we bust it.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.826
What are you doing,
you daft girl?

24:55.828 --> 24:58.128
I'm turning you
into a mummy.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.640
So did your parents never
take you to the seaside then?

25:09.642 --> 25:12.176
No. I wanted to go.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.278
Seen pictures and that.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.280
Got family in Brighton,
actually.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.082
- Brighton?
- Yeah.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.918
Never been down though.
We're not really close.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.786
- I don't wanna go.
- Why not?

25:22.788 --> 25:23.854
It's cold!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.523
What about you?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.691
What's your family like?

25:27.693 --> 25:29.760
Oh...

25:29.762 --> 25:32.630
Haven't seen them for a while.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.698
What, you don't like them?

25:36.836 --> 25:39.770
My mum wouldn't talk to me
for a quite a long time.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.639
Why?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.107
I don't know.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.876
Did she not want you
to be a teacher?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.812
She was all right with that.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.248
I don't know.
Families, you know.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.783
Yeah.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.302
I won. Gotcha.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.641
Smile.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.679
Hmm.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.021
Why do clouds
sometimes move so fast

26:31.023 --> 26:34.058
and sometimes
don't move at all?

26:34.060 --> 26:36.060
I don't know.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.263
There must be something
inside of them.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.698
The wind?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.199
No, that's too easy.

26:42.201 --> 26:45.069
Must be like pressure
or atmosphere.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.973
Why make it more complex
than it is?

26:50.643 --> 26:52.843
Scientific gas?

26:54.313 --> 26:57.848
It could just be the amount
of rain inside of them.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.350
I don't know.

26:59.352 --> 27:00.618
You're the teacher.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.620
Art teacher.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.922
You should take more notice
in your geography class.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.790
Why would I listen
to Miss Robson

27:06.792 --> 27:09.093
when I can just watch you
across the quad?

27:35.354 --> 27:37.688
- Ow!
- Don't be such a girl.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.858
Don't be such a boy!

27:40.860 --> 27:43.761
Right.
That's the truth hat.

27:43.763 --> 27:47.398
You spill your guts
or your fill your guts.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.899
I really don't like seafood.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.301
Well, better tell
the truth then.

27:51.303 --> 27:55.906
Am I the best shag
you've ever had?

27:55.908 --> 27:57.107
Oh.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.679
All right.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.783
Have... Have you...

28:05.785 --> 28:08.318
ever shagged a student before?

28:09.722 --> 28:12.056
No. No!

28:14.794 --> 28:17.161
Um...

28:17.163 --> 28:18.862
Do you love me?

28:23.803 --> 28:25.903
Well...

28:25.905 --> 28:27.271
I do.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.950
What's the big joke?

29:12.952 --> 29:15.119
You wouldn't get it.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.054
Is it from Sam?

29:17.056 --> 29:18.489
Sam?

29:18.491 --> 29:20.124
You've forgotten him already?

29:20.126 --> 29:21.759
I know who he is.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.994
You still see him?

29:23.996 --> 29:26.296
We're in the same year.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.398
I meant...

29:28.400 --> 29:30.868
- I know what you meant.
- Well?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.372
Not really.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.407
What's that supposed to mean?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.811
Why are you so interested?

29:43.315 --> 29:44.848
I'm not.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.918
Are you jealous?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.253
Don't be ridiculous.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.221
- Yes, you are.
- Of a 16-year-old?

29:51.223 --> 29:53.023
Well, you're having sex
with a 16-year-old,

29:53.025 --> 29:55.259
so why can't you be
jealous of one?

29:55.261 --> 29:57.961
Anyway, you're the one
with a girlfriend.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.029
You're so immature.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.197
Surprise!

30:03.369 --> 30:04.868
Eww.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.508
You all right?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.579
Oh, God. Wow.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.082
That was intense.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.485
It's that seafood, isn't it?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.220
Don't know.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.889
- Maybe.
- Shit, I'm sorry.

30:25.891 --> 30:28.225
Do you want to go back
to the hotel?

30:28.227 --> 30:30.928
And I can get something
for your belly, if you like.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.097
It's all right.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.499
I'll go.

31:26.185 --> 31:30.087
Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Wright?

31:30.089 --> 31:32.155
How are you enjoying your stay
at the Metropole so far?

31:32.157 --> 31:33.624
Oh, great.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.626
Are you satisfied with service,
the room, etcetera?

31:35.628 --> 31:37.060
Yes, quite happy.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.362
- You clear about our policy?
- Sorry?

31:38.364 --> 31:41.198
- The terms of your stay.
- Yes, yeah.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.567
Anything you'd like
to add or mention?

31:43.569 --> 31:45.335
No. It's all good, thanks.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.070
There was someone
asking for you earlier.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.505
I told him you were out.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.141
Oh, okay, thanks.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.643
Seemed like a nice boy.

31:57.182 --> 31:58.348
Shit.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.222
Aha!

32:05.224 --> 32:07.457
Thumb's up.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.226
- What for?
- Ah, come on.

32:09.228 --> 32:13.030
No need to be bashful.
She's quite the find.

32:13.032 --> 32:16.166
- What are you talking about?
- Your secret is safe with me.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.135
I don't know what you mean.

32:18.137 --> 32:21.605
I bet she's quite a handful,
your niece.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.574
Shit.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.279
Hey, you're alive.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.447
What the hell?

32:31.684 --> 32:34.451
Are you mad?
What did you tell him?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.653
He caught me sneaking past.
I had to say something.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.689
- Shit.
- Why are you so stressed?

32:38.691 --> 32:42.059
There's a small matter of
having to declare extra guests.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.528
And there's probably a clause
somewhere about not accepting

32:44.530 --> 32:47.331
teachers who are having affairs
with their pupils.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.700
It's fine.
I said I was your nephew.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.234
- What?
- I'm joking.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.302
For God's sake.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.470
My niece?

32:53.472 --> 32:55.272
That's what he said to say.

32:55.274 --> 32:58.542
He said if I was discreet,
we could come to an arrangement.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.177
Fuck.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.179
The guy's not right.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.583
What exactly did you tell him?

33:06.585 --> 33:09.019
No.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.054
I want you to remember
absolutely everything he said

33:11.056 --> 33:12.689
and everything you told him.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.458
Jesus, relax!

33:14.460 --> 33:17.160
He's just a dirty old pervert
who wanted a grope.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.129
You've no idea, do you,
how serious this all is.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.664
What did you say to him?

33:20.666 --> 33:25.302
Uh, I don't know,
that we were on a school trip.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.471
- What?
- I'm joking!

33:27.473 --> 33:30.674
Are you insane?
Are you insane?

33:30.676 --> 33:33.276
- You're joking now?
- I can't help it. I'm nervous.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.512
Tell me what he said, Beth!

33:35.514 --> 33:38.382
All right!

33:38.384 --> 33:41.018
I was trying to sneak past
reception without him seeing me,

33:41.020 --> 33:43.153
and he called me back,
and he asked where I was going.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.188
Said I'm meeting somebody
on the fifth floor.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.025
And he said, "Who?"
I said, "None of your business."

33:48.027 --> 33:52.295
He said it was, especially if I
was doing business on his turf.

33:54.299 --> 33:57.100
Do you know...
Do you realize what he was...

33:57.102 --> 33:58.402
I know what he meant.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.437
He was proper all over me,
like all smarmy,

34:00.439 --> 34:03.473
so just I told him
what he wanted to hear.

34:05.744 --> 34:08.311
I told him
that it was my first time,

34:08.313 --> 34:10.179
and I picked you up in a pub,

34:10.181 --> 34:12.248
and you told me
to meet you at this hotel.

34:12.251 --> 34:16.053
And then he asked how much
I was charging, so I said 50.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.521
He said that I could get
way more

34:17.523 --> 34:20.190
and to make sure
that you paid me upfront.

34:20.192 --> 34:24.161
Why? What on earth
possessed you?

34:24.163 --> 34:26.596
Magic.
What do you call it

34:26.598 --> 34:28.264
when you're pointing
at something over there,

34:28.266 --> 34:30.734
but it's really about
is right here?

34:30.735 --> 34:31.768
Misdirection.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.637
See?

34:33.639 --> 34:36.606
The last thing he's expecting
is a teacher and a pupil.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.210
This can't go on.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.846
- What do you mean?
- Us.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.382
Which part?

34:46.385 --> 34:47.385
All of it.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.853
It's over.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.766
Beth.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.237
Beth, just wait, okay?

35:07.239 --> 35:08.772
What?

35:10.409 --> 35:11.842
Can't end it like this.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.643
Can't we?
I thought that you just had.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.379
Come on.
You know how I feel about you.

35:16.381 --> 35:18.548
- It's just... It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.251
You made it complicated.
You made it weird.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.752
We go away from everything
and everyone,

35:22.754 --> 35:24.287
and you're still weirding out.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.790
I know, I know.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.459
I want to be with you.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.728
And then I'm terrified
of what it means.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.797
Don't go! I love you.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.666
No, you don't. Don't say that.
It doesn't make sense.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.236
- It does.
- So then leave her.

35:39.238 --> 35:43.507
Be with me.
Leave school with me. I will.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.879
I'm gonna ask you
to marry me.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.449
What?

35:52.451 --> 35:55.752
When I get back.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.420
You can't.

36:00.425 --> 36:03.260
It's the right thing to do.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.829
You came here knowing?

36:05.831 --> 36:06.831
It's for the best.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.702
I won't let you.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.738
- You can't stop it, Beth.
- You want to bet?

36:14.740 --> 36:17.174
I've got pictures that could be
all around school tomorrow.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.742
Wedding off. Done.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.178
- You wouldn't.
- Try me!

36:22.381 --> 36:24.548
- You couldn't.
- Are you sure?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.568
I've taken them.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.839
Are you lost in there?

37:29.848 --> 37:30.914
You all right?

37:33.885 --> 37:36.453
I may look busy, but you can
still use me for sex,

37:36.455 --> 37:38.255
if you like.

37:43.695 --> 37:44.995
Do you...

37:48.333 --> 37:51.768
Do you ever think
about the future?

37:51.770 --> 37:54.304
Daz?

37:54.306 --> 37:56.840
Yeah, sure, I mean,
I wanna get me A-levels

37:56.842 --> 37:58.842
and go to college like you.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.748
Why do you want to do that?

38:04.750 --> 38:08.485
Just don't want to end up
like my mum and dad.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.619
What's wrong with that?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.788
They can't stand each other.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.760
Yeah, but they're still together
though, aren't they?

38:16.762 --> 38:18.762
Yeah, but he's
a womanizing bastard,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.764
and she hates his guts.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.035
So why don't they split?

38:27.506 --> 38:28.672
Don't know.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.376
I suppose they must have
their reasons.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.712
Yeah, but stupid ones,
if you ask me.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.381
Like if you're that unhappy
that you'd shag someone else,

38:38.383 --> 38:41.484
then why are you with
the person in the first place?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.854
It's not as simple as that,
is it?

38:44.856 --> 38:46.990
No, but it is.
It's black and white.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.959
He's a bastard. He can
get away with it, so he does.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.728
And he don't respect her.
I mean, how can he?

38:51.730 --> 38:54.097
And if you don't have respect,
then, you know...

38:54.099 --> 38:55.732
Then what's the point?

38:58.337 --> 39:00.337
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't...

39:02.708 --> 39:03.807
Don't be.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.680
- I meant what I said.
- Apology accepted.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.783
No. What I said earlier.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.686
When I said I loved you.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.957
Do you love me?

39:36.108 --> 39:37.607
Do you love me?

39:43.648 --> 39:44.781
Daz...

39:44.783 --> 39:46.983
You can't say it, can you?

40:13.545 --> 40:14.778
What?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.880
- Can we talk?
- What?

40:18.717 --> 40:20.550
We need to talk.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.920
Isn't that what you say
to someone when you dump them?

40:26.725 --> 40:28.725
I don't think this can work.

40:29.728 --> 40:30.960
Funny that.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.028
Seemed okay last night.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.496
"Yes, Daz. More, Daz.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.799
Never felt like this
before, Daz.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.468
This is really difficult for me.

40:38.470 --> 40:41.204
What? Two guys on the go.
That the problem like?

40:41.206 --> 40:43.706
- Don't bring him into it.
- Right.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.775
So it's okay for you
to nag me about my ex,

40:45.777 --> 40:47.777
but I can't even bring up
your current boyfriend?

40:47.779 --> 40:49.045
Right, I get it.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.480
I'm sorry.
I was out of order.

40:50.482 --> 40:52.215
I shouldn't have
said anything.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.517
What's he like?

40:54.519 --> 40:56.219
- Daz.
- It's a simple question.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.455
What is he like?

40:58.457 --> 41:01.024
Is he like me?

41:01.026 --> 41:03.226
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.096
How old is he?

41:07.098 --> 41:08.131
Fifty.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.132
Fifty?!

41:09.134 --> 41:10.133
Four.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.236
Fifty-fucking-four!

41:13.238 --> 41:15.505
At least he'll be dead soon.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.173
That's the least
of our problems.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.641
What, the age or him?

41:18.643 --> 41:20.543
The age, him, everything.

41:20.545 --> 41:22.178
- Well, then leave him.
- It's not as simple as that.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.713
Well, it is to me.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.782
You don't understand.
You can't.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.117
- Why? Because I'm a kid?
- I didn't say that.

41:28.119 --> 41:31.955
Don't fucking patronize me.
I'm the one who chased you.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.823
For fuck's sake!

41:36.561 --> 41:38.828
I'm pregnant, okay?

41:48.273 --> 41:49.672
Are you sure?

41:49.674 --> 41:52.041
I've never skipped one before.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.147
And you did a test?

42:00.585 --> 42:02.519
I'm sure, okay?

42:02.521 --> 42:04.554
I was gonna tell you.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.026
How long has it been?

42:12.597 --> 42:14.030
Weeks?

42:14.032 --> 42:16.232
Months? Fuck's sake.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.704
It's quite a lot to take in,
that's all.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.706
I bet. Poor you.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.943
Of course.
Look, I'm sorry. I mean...

42:31.750 --> 42:33.182
- How are you?
- Don't worry.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.252
I'm not gonna fuck up
your perfect life.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.659
So it was the first time we...

42:45.564 --> 42:48.164
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

42:48.166 --> 42:50.733
What's the point?
You don't want it, do you?

42:52.003 --> 42:54.137
That's what I thought.

42:54.139 --> 42:56.039
Beth...

42:56.041 --> 42:59.175
I'll do, you know,
whatever you need.

42:59.177 --> 43:01.945
I don't want anything from you.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.014
So you've decided?

43:05.016 --> 43:07.617
Yep. Bye-bye, baby.

43:07.619 --> 43:09.285
Bam.

43:09.287 --> 43:12.722
How can you think like that?
It's a life inside of you.

43:12.724 --> 43:16.326
It's not even got a heart.
It's just a... a thing.

43:16.328 --> 43:18.628
Hey, that's my thing
and your thing.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.863
It's gonna be incredible,
with hands and feet.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.699
Daz, stop, please!

43:22.701 --> 43:25.134
They will lock me up.
I will go to prison.

43:25.136 --> 43:28.371
- For loving someone?
- Yes!

43:28.373 --> 43:31.240
They don't care about that.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.676
They care about the law.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.947
I'm your teacher,
for God's sake. It's illegal.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.149
Forget school then.
It's never taught me anyway.

43:40.151 --> 43:42.719
We can leave, be together,
start over.

43:42.721 --> 43:45.922
It's too late.

43:45.924 --> 43:48.124
It won't take a genius to work
out when the baby was born

43:48.126 --> 43:50.293
and when you made me pregnant.

43:51.830 --> 43:53.763
Why are you smiling?

43:53.765 --> 43:55.898
Just what you said,
"When you made me pregnant."

43:55.900 --> 43:57.200
It sounds boss-like.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.268
Daz, please, be serious.

43:59.270 --> 44:00.937
Look, I love you.

44:00.939 --> 44:02.739
I love you, and you're
gonna have my baby.

44:02.741 --> 44:04.007
I'm not.

44:06.711 --> 44:09.112
I'm having a termination
as soon as we get back.

44:10.815 --> 44:11.814
You serious?

44:11.816 --> 44:14.050
Deadly.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.351
Don't I have a say in this?

44:15.353 --> 44:16.853
No.

44:18.356 --> 44:19.422
It's my body.

44:20.425 --> 44:22.425
Yeah. It's my baby.

44:24.863 --> 44:26.996
I can't breathe in here.

44:32.971 --> 44:35.905
It's simple.
We leave together.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.774
New place, new start, new life.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.109
- No one's gonna know.
- Where would we go?

44:40.111 --> 44:41.277
Anywhere.

44:41.279 --> 44:42.412
What would we live on?

44:42.414 --> 44:44.881
- Breast milk.
- Oh, stop it.

44:44.883 --> 44:47.817
Oh, my God.
They're gonna be epic!

44:47.819 --> 44:50.219
Okay, so how are you
gonna provide for me

44:50.221 --> 44:51.354
now that I'm all knocked up?

44:51.356 --> 44:52.889
I told you. I've got money.

44:52.891 --> 44:54.757
My nan set me up
a SuperSaver years ago,

44:54.759 --> 44:56.759
so now after all that growth,
we'll be good.

44:56.761 --> 44:58.127
For how long?

44:58.129 --> 45:00.163
- Forever.
- That's a long time, Daz.

45:00.165 --> 45:01.898
I'll be old and wrinkly
before then,

45:01.900 --> 45:03.166
and you'll be back
with Sam Woods.

45:03.168 --> 45:05.068
No. Her tits are too small.

45:05.070 --> 45:06.936
Stop it now, Daz.

45:07.939 --> 45:10.306
This isn't a joke.

45:10.308 --> 45:13.743
Do you know how long
we've spent together?

45:13.745 --> 45:15.044
In each other s company?

45:15.046 --> 45:16.813
I don't care.

45:16.815 --> 45:18.781
I added it all up.

45:18.783 --> 45:20.116
All those lunch hours,

45:20.118 --> 45:22.852
that afternoon away
before this weekend?

45:22.854 --> 45:25.221
Two-and-a-half days.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.223
Two-and-a-half days, Daz.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.225
So?

45:29.227 --> 45:31.294
That's the sum total
of our relationship.

45:31.296 --> 45:35.264
It's the best two and a half
days of my life.

45:35.266 --> 45:38.468
I've been with the same man
for the past 20 years.

45:38.470 --> 45:40.236
Well, five minutes
of something wonderful

45:40.238 --> 45:42.839
is better than a lifetime
of nothing special.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.894
I want to go on that.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.880
This is my favorite food.

46:25.216 --> 46:26.282
Sugar?

46:32.090 --> 46:34.457
It's like your coat.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.225
It's like your hair.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.487
One more. One more!

47:12.197 --> 47:13.462
Bye-bye.

47:18.436 --> 47:19.569
Yay!

47:37.889 --> 47:40.056
I think I missed
my last train.

47:41.059 --> 47:43.926
The room's all paid for.

47:43.928 --> 47:45.461
We never checked out.

47:47.465 --> 47:50.466
Oh, you have
such a way with words.

48:28.439 --> 48:31.073
We tried for years
to have a child.

48:34.612 --> 48:36.913
The tests said it was him
with the problem.

48:39.484 --> 48:41.918
I got stuck.

48:41.920 --> 48:45.688
Just had to accept that...

48:45.690 --> 48:49.191
motherhood was something
that happened to other women.

48:49.193 --> 48:51.294
You're a mother now.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.134
Did you mean
what you said before?

48:58.136 --> 48:59.602
What?

49:02.040 --> 49:04.206
The baby.
Can you see yourself?

49:04.208 --> 49:06.409
Jesus Christ!
How many times? Yes!

49:08.079 --> 49:10.146
It's just with me,
it'd be so complicated.

49:10.148 --> 49:12.148
I want it with you.

49:12.150 --> 49:14.617
Your baby, my baby,
together.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.519
We could get married.

49:16.521 --> 49:18.354
And what if someone
found out?

49:18.356 --> 49:20.356
Why would they?

49:26.264 --> 49:29.098
When I was at school,

49:29.100 --> 49:31.734
a teacher fell in love
with one of the pupils.

49:34.539 --> 49:37.406
It got out,
and they had to leave.

49:37.408 --> 49:40.009
Well, did they leave together?

49:40.011 --> 49:42.378
Yeah, they did.

49:42.380 --> 49:45.314
So what's your point?
They won.

49:48.453 --> 49:51.721
It can be a lonely place.

49:51.723 --> 49:53.723
Can you imagine no one
wanting to know you?

49:53.725 --> 49:56.525
Well, I don't want
to know them.

49:59.297 --> 50:01.397
We'd have to leave everything.

50:01.399 --> 50:03.466
Everyone.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.368
I'm ready.

51:06.697 --> 51:09.065
Sorry I've been such a dick.

51:17.308 --> 51:18.841
Floss fingers.

51:59.784 --> 52:02.218
Did I say I loved you?

52:06.591 --> 52:08.757
I think you might have
snuck one in mid-argument,

52:08.759 --> 52:13.262
so technically,
I'm not sure it counts.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.500
Well, I do.

52:17.502 --> 52:20.402
Do what?

52:20.404 --> 52:22.271
Love you.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.513
Aiden, I know that you like
looking at my naked body,

52:30.515 --> 52:33.516
but can I put some clothes on
'cause I'm freezing my tits off?

52:54.839 --> 52:57.173
Is it weird saying my name?

52:59.777 --> 53:02.778
I could never call a teacher
by their first name.

53:06.284 --> 53:09.418
Speaking of names, Aiden,

53:09.420 --> 53:12.354
you still haven't told me
what your girlfriend's is.

53:17.795 --> 53:19.595
Christine.

53:21.866 --> 53:23.966
So what do you call her?

53:23.968 --> 53:26.802
Christie? Tina?

53:29.640 --> 53:31.373
Chris.

53:31.375 --> 53:34.343
Bloke's name, isn't it?

53:34.345 --> 53:37.613
Yeah, and Sam's a girl's name.

53:39.951 --> 53:42.251
What does she look like?

53:43.721 --> 53:44.820
Me?

53:47.892 --> 53:50.292
Show me a picture of her.

53:51.896 --> 53:54.396
I don't want to go there.

53:56.334 --> 54:00.469
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
You don't do pictures.

54:12.850 --> 54:14.617
There's fireworks!

57:39.457 --> 57:40.956
Your face!

57:45.496 --> 57:47.129
So?

57:47.131 --> 57:49.131
What?

57:49.133 --> 57:51.800
Don't I get a present?

57:51.802 --> 57:54.970
Who says you don't?

57:54.972 --> 57:58.040
There's nothing in your bag,
and I looked everywhere else.

57:58.042 --> 58:00.676
I didn't find anything there.

58:00.678 --> 58:02.244
I got you a card.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.813
Pffft!

58:04.815 --> 58:07.182
There might be clues in it.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.817
Where is it?

58:32.910 --> 58:36.178
"Ask and it shall be given.
You seek, and you shall find.

58:36.180 --> 58:39.882
Knock, and it shall be
opened unto you. Ask."

58:39.884 --> 58:42.518
I told you about the card.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.053
Seek, and you found it, right?

58:45.055 --> 58:46.255
Knock?

58:52.963 --> 58:53.962
Bye-bye.

58:53.964 --> 58:54.997
Bye!

58:54.999 --> 58:56.198
Buh-bye.

59:02.606 --> 59:04.840
Yeah, come in.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.045
Where is it?

59:19.957 --> 59:21.623
Milady.

59:51.655 --> 59:54.590
Your very first "A" from me.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.093
Do you like it?

59:58.095 --> 59:59.628
I proper love it.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:07.669
"I don't know how.
I don't know when.

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:11.173
But wait and you'll see.
I will be part of your world."

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.942
It's from <i> The Little Mermaid.</i>

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:18.914
My little mermaid.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.652
Happy birthday.

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.020
Thanks.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.767
I'm starving.

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:41.837
I'm gonna have everything.

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.305
What are you having?

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:44.806
I'll have yours too.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.408
Hi.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:49.244
Could I have the straight
out of bed breakfast

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:50.846
with black pudding

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:53.281
and the pancakes
with maple syrup

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.784
and a coffee, please.

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.285
Or a tea.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:00.656
No, I'll have a coffee,
please.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:01.890
And for you?

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:03.258
I'll have a Bloody Mary.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.994
- But make that a virgin, love.
- What?

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.063
Just play along, okay?
Just one day, right?

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:10.232
And then you can do
whatever you want.

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.667
Deal?

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:14.870
Deal.

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:16.271
Then you can
kill me unborn child!

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:17.739
For God's sake!

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.416
You go first.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:35.023
Actually, no.

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:03.385
- Don't even think about it.
- Yeah, but we made a deal.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:06.755
Well, this wasn't
part of it, was it?

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:08.924
I just don't want my kids
to end up with flipper hands.

01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:10.959
Oh, Daz, shut up.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.828
And it ages your skin.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.830
I swear I'm gonna deck you!

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:55.237
I want the baby.
I really want it.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:59.141
Beth, me too.

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:00.175
Really?

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.013
You have no idea
what this means to me.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.551
Thought it was never possible.

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:11.853
You've just got to choose
the right woman.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:13.121
It's easy with me.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:15.190
I know. It's mad.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:20.428
We had fertility tests
back months ago.

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:24.399
Couldn't even open the envelope.

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:26.301
- Why?
- Until you do,

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:29.337
there's still a chance that
things are gonna be okay, right?

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:32.407
Well, now you know.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.154
This is amazing. This.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:51.893
But I can't have a kid now,
all right?

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:54.296
Beth, listen to me,
please, listen.

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:56.398
Look, I want this,
I promise you.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.466
If you have the kid now,

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.602
people are going to ask
so many questions.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:03.305
I'll say it's someone else's.

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:07.142
Like who?

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.377
I don't know. Sam's.

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:11.513
And he'll just...

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:17.986
Did you two...

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:21.289
Yeah, at Mikey Parker s party.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:25.126
Okay.

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:26.394
It was before you.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:27.996
But you said that...

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.474
Can't do that to someone.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.646
I promise.

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:48.083
I promise we'll have a child
together, okay? Soon.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.919
Who knows?
Maybe we'll have loads.

01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.995
Let's have them freely.

01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:02.631
With a father
who can be there.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:08.637
What do you think?

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:43.171
I'll do it if you leave her.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.311
- Okay.
- No more faffing.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:52.147
I want you to do it proper.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:54.382
I promise.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.384
So do it.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.354
I will.

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:02.023
Call her.

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:03.692
- Beth.
- Now.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.532
What, do you need more time to
wriggle out of this one as well?

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:14.536
You meant what you said, yeah?
So do it.

01:06:24.014 --> 01:06:26.581
You really want me to do this
in front of you?

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:44.399
Yeah, hey, it's me.

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:47.769
Sorry I missed you earlier.
I didn't hear the phone.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.538
No.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:55.143
I know.

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:03.385
Yeah, I know what we discussed.

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:06.521
Yeah, I know I promised.
I said I would do it.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:10.058
I thought I could...

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.260
but I can't do it.

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:18.099
Sorry, Chris.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:23.571
No, it's something else.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:28.376
It's hard for me
to say this to you, but...

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:34.382
Yeah, she is.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:41.256
Two months.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:31.840
Animal.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:49.323
What would be
the best name for a dog?

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:53.328
I don't know. What would be
the best name for a dog?

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:56.898
It's not a joke. I'm actually
asking. I don't know.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.666
What about him?

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:01.569
I reckon it's "Lad."
I'm a lad factory.

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.171
I was thinking, right?

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.140
I just can't wait
to start traditions.

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:08.475
You know, like take him places,
tell him stories about us and...

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:12.346
Daz, stop, please.

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:14.448
What?

01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:17.452
I can't.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:21.389
I can't hear you play daddy
anymore.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.591
- Being this...
- You think I'm playing?

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.295
I want this more than you,
remember?

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:32.700
You have no idea
how difficult this is.

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:41.408
I was pregnant once.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.849
I got rid of it
just like that.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:55.223
'Cause I thought
it was what he wanted.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:58.793
What are you
talking about, Beth?

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:01.930
I can't have this child,

01:10:01.932 --> 01:10:04.832
no matter how much
I might want it.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:07.936
I don't get you. Why can't you
just do whatever you want?

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:10.738
Because you're just a kid!

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:15.877
You don't know any better!

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.713
And you shouldn't have to.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:52.447
Steady.

01:10:52.449 --> 01:10:54.449
Beth, you'll make yourself sick.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:04.826
Ooh. Is that her again?

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.428
When is she gonna get it?
You've lost him. Get over it.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.497
Don't gloat.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:11.799
You got what you wanted.
Be gracious.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:15.436
Well, turn your phone off
because she's ruining my day.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.776
I want to see the show!

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:30.385
Just put your head
through the hole in the rope.

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.619
No, show me!

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.920
You want me to show you
how to do it?

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.555
Oh, yes.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:36.624
- It's quite simple.
- Show me how to do it!

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.626
Just put your head
through there.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.928
- Through here?
- And I will pull the rope.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.498
No, not your foot.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.600
That's the way to do it!

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:47.869
That's the way to do it!

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:48.903
Yeah, it's me.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:05.920
It's me, Beth.

01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:10.825
Chris opened the letter.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:16.631
I can't have children.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:20.401
How could you make up
something like that?

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:23.705
I wasn't gonna keep it.
That was the deal, wasn't it?

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:27.375
For God's sake, Beth!

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:30.511
This isn't a game!
This is real! This is my life!

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:35.550
I had to do something,
or you're never gonna leave her.

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:37.685
So you lied?

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.355
You lied about a baby.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.790
And then you would've lied
when you...

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.759
How can I ever trust you, Beth?

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:47.495
Don't say that. Yes, you can.
I love you.

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.497
It's the only thing
that I think about,

01:12:49.499 --> 01:12:51.132
how happy we're gonna be
together.

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.401
The wedding that we're
gonna have, my dress.

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:54.569
- Everything.
- Beth...

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:56.104
It's gonna be in Greece.

01:12:56.106 --> 01:12:58.740
All in white. I've decided.
Just you and me.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:01.609
I've seen the place on the
television, and it's beautiful.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.611
And we can live there together.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.446
And the children
that we're gonna have,

01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:07.548
I've got their names
and everything.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.485
Beth, I can't have kids, okay?

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:12.520
- That's bollocks!
- Beth...

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:14.655
That's her, not you.
She's old.

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:17.425
I can give you children.
I know I can.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.760
Beth!

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.433
- Just stop.
- I'm sorry.

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:27.835
No, stop, okay?

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.771
I'm sorry.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:32.774
I'm sorry.
Please don't leave me.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:36.477
Please! Don't leave me.
I'm sorry.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:38.713
Please.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:39.947
Ow!

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:41.582
- Don't.
- No.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.751
I'm sorry.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:54.729
Why don't you go back
to the hotel?

01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:55.963
I just need to...

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.199
- I'll come.
- No. It's fine.

01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:00.868
I just need to...
clear my head, you know.

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:02.437
Okay.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.442
So I'll see you later.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:09.811
- What?
- Give me the keys.

01:14:51.855 --> 01:14:53.921
How was it?

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:56.190
It was good, thanks.

01:14:58.795 --> 01:15:02.029
Did you get some thinking done?

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:05.032
Yeah, I did.

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:07.735
What did you get?

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.906
It's a pregnancy test.

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:14.742
I can see that.

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:24.151
I'd like to be sure.

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:29.056
Don't you love me anymore?

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:32.193
There's a lot at stake here.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.596
And I've given up a lot.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.267
And I haven't?

01:15:39.269 --> 01:15:41.135
Have you?

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:47.608
I just want there
to be any doubt,

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:50.111
even the slightest between us.

01:15:54.817 --> 01:15:56.817
I know what the result will be.

01:15:56.819 --> 01:15:59.820
I'm sure you do.
I just want to as well.

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:07.862
It'll test positive.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:14.802
Is it Sam s?

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.147
Hello? Excuse me, love.

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:27.748
Excuse me, wait up.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.984
Yes. I've had someone
staying here.

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:31.319
Can we deal with this later?

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:33.321
It's about your husband.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.924
- My what?
- He called this morning.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.693
Several times.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.796
Did you tell him I was here?

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:43.731
Well, he asked to be
put through to you.

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.766
- I assumed...
- Yeah, of course.

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.902
He was... how shall I say...

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.770
asking about
your present company.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.639
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:53.341
Yeah, it's fine.

01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:55.843
I don't know the nature of your
relationship with your guest...

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:57.311
What the fuck is it to you?

01:16:57.313 --> 01:16:59.213
We'll have none of that language
here, young man!

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:01.882
Thing is, love, we don't want
to get involved in anything.

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:04.619
So why you sticking your nose
in other people's business?

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.187
We'll get our stuff, okay?

01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:08.155
I think that would be best.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:10.224
- Why is he asking...
- Come on, come on.

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.693
I didn't say nothing to him,
the little shit.

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:21.035
Why are you so upset?

01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:22.703
I didn't tell him.

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:24.005
Tell him what?

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.873
It's all a mistake.
A big mistake.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:27.408
What was I thinking?

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.677
He knows.
Of course he knows.

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:32.046
What are you talking about?
He knows what?

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:39.053
He knows because
I've been here before.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.190
The same hotel.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.228
Exact same room.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:51.432
When I was at school,

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:53.901
I came here with Aiden.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.206
He brought me here.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.942
Aiden, you've got to believe me.
I didn't plan none of this.

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:03.944
- It just happened.
- Yeah, sure.

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:05.713
Please!
He doesn't mean anything.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:08.015
- It's you that I want.
- Why did you sleep with him?

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.950
To get back at Saskia.
That's all.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:12.420
He doesn't mean anything.
It was just sex.

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:14.188
How can sex not matter to you?

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.223
How can it mean
so little already?

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:18.192
It was just once before you.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:22.129
You had her and me.
It didn't stop you loving me.

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:24.365
I don't know who you are.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:27.001
No, please!
We're meant to be together!

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:30.271
- I'll die if we don't!
- Grow up.

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:32.339
I'm going downstairs
to settle the bill.

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:35.309
I'll see you outside in five.
Five minutes!

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:36.911
I won't wait.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:49.857
So how did you find
Scarborough?

01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:52.093
- Full of surprises.
- Well, there you go.

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:53.494
First of many trips then?

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:55.062
It's unlikely.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.965
Sorry to hear that.
Any particular reason?

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:01.235
Here's the extra.

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:06.907
For the guest.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.943
Oh, that's not necessary.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:12.213
I'd feel better
if you took it.

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:15.116
What, like things are clearer
when you pay for them?

01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:33.968
Daz.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:38.305
Daz, wait, please!

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.550
- Please listen to me.
- Get off of me!

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:53.020
- Please let me explain.
- It's a bit late now.

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:54.922
I tried to tell you, I did,
in my own way!

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:56.457
By saying you knew a girl
at school who fucked a teacher?

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:58.292
I'm supposed to know
that was you?

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.061
I'm sure you're right.
I should've told you.

01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:03.063
I just didn't know how to.

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:05.166
So this is
your thing then, Beth?

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:08.002
Teachers and pupils?
You get off on that shit?

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.476
I've only ever been with him.

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:20.548
Just Aiden.

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:22.550
Why me?

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:24.552
What, am I just a little fucking
science experiment to you?

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:25.986
No, Daz, please,
don't think that!

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:27.188
Don't touch me.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:34.094
How old were you?

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:39.300
I was sixteen.

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:44.038
That's fucked up.

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:11.398
This is your train.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.967
Aren't you coming?

01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:16.403
I think we should
travel separately.

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:18.339
Okay.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:20.374
I'll take the next one.

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:25.346
I so want the baby
to be yours.

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:28.549
You should get on.

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:32.253
Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:34.355
I'll get rid of the baby.
Anything.

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:36.357
Stop.

01:21:36.359 --> 01:21:38.359
You think that's what you want,
but it isn't.

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:43.097
- It is. I'll prove it. I will.
- Just leave it, okay?

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:45.466
Come on.

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:47.334
It's for the best.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.541
Thanks.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:01.415
Just get on the train, Beth.
Please.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:04.085
We should go.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:13.160
Look, I think we should travel
separate-like.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.998
I'll, uh...

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.600
see you at school.

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:23.637
Go back to how we were
before-like, okay?

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:28.208
Right.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:29.276
I love you.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:09.209
Hi. Is that Christine?

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.213
You don't know me.
My name is Beth.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.115
And I'm in Mr. Pott's
art class.

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:17.451
Sorry to disturb you
in the middle of the day,

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:20.054
