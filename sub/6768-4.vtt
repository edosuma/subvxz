00:05.046 --> 00:07.048
I know this isn't
her home anymore.

00:07.132 --> 00:10.760
{\an3}That's okay.
It's just temporary.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.720
She'll love it.

00:11.803 --> 00:12.846
{\an1}Good.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.931
Oh, they're here.

00:17.642 --> 00:18.601
{\an3}DONNA:
Hi.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.602
Ah!

00:19.686 --> 00:21.271
I'm so glad to see you.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.356
Hello, Winston.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.774
Come on, Kelly,
let's sit down.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.861
Mom, I'm fine.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.617
So, anything look familiar?

00:34.701 --> 00:35.910
You.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.912
Yeah.

00:39.038 --> 00:41.082
You're that handsome guy

00:41.166 --> 00:43.501
{\an3}that waited by my hospital
bed day and night.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.796
That's right.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.173
That's a nice dress.

00:48.256 --> 00:52.427
{\an1}But I do miss the gown
with the tie in the back.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.640
Hey, you broke out!

00:58.391 --> 00:59.976
{\an1}Beautiful flowers
for you.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.519
Oh, thank you.
They're pretty.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.313
Hey, in case someone
tells you different,

01:03.396 --> 01:05.315
I'm the thoughtful one.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.150
This is so sweet of you,

01:07.233 --> 01:09.152
{\an3}and I'm sure Kelly's
really glad to see you,

01:09.235 --> 01:10.779
but she needs to rest.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.156
Yeah, we're gonna go.
But we'll come back later, okay?

01:13.239 --> 01:15.283
{\an3}Feel good.
Thanks.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.495
{\an1}I'll, uh...
I'll call you later.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.288
Okay.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.415
Let's get you settled, honey.
I'll put these in some water.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.126
Okay.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.962
{\an3}Kel, your bedroom's at
the end of the hall.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.422
{\an1}Okay. Thanks.
Okay?

01:31.424 --> 01:32.842
I don't get it, Brandon.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.513
How come she didn't come
home to you or her mom?

01:36.596 --> 01:38.348
This is the only place
she remembers living.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.390
Oh, Brandon...

01:39.474 --> 01:41.559
She's gonna get better, man.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.645
{\an3}Things are gonna get back
to the way they were.

01:43.728 --> 01:47.315
She's not wearing my ring.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.192
The one on the chain.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.071
She must have taken it off.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.405
Come on.

Hey.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.190
You know, I'd always fix
the pillows a certain way

03:52.273 --> 03:55.777
and then you'd come and
you'd fix them this way.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.446
{\an3}You're starting to
remember things.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.281
{\an3}I know you don't
realize it, but you are.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.451
We were good friends,
weren't we?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.286
Yeah, the best.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.245
{\an1}I know.

04:06.329 --> 04:10.041
I don't "remember-know,"
I just sort of know.

04:10.124 --> 04:13.962
It's like that with some people.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.339
But I'm really having
to just trust my instincts.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.300
Otherwise, it gets
really overwhelming.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.219
Well,
that's the best way to go.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.430
I feel really close
to Valerie, too.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.183
On the other hand,

04:27.266 --> 04:28.893
don't be afraid
to question those feelings.

04:32.397 --> 04:37.068
Donna... did I love Brandon?

04:38.277 --> 04:40.780
I mean, did I really love him?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.740
Yes.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.659
I try to remember how it felt.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.661
{\an3}It's hard to
remember feelings.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.038
You got to just feel it.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.373
Yeah.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.541
(door opening
and footfalls approaching)

04:51.624 --> 04:53.876
Kelly, hey.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.253
{\an3}You look good, girl.
Oh, hi.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.212
What are you doing here?

04:56.295 --> 04:57.755
They released me this morning.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.215
Oh, what were
you in for?

04:59.298 --> 05:01.050
{\an3}DAVID:
The hospital,

05:01.134 --> 05:02.010
{\an1}not jail.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.469
This is my stepsister,

05:03.553 --> 05:06.097
{\an3}and, uh, this is
my girlfriend Donna.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.391
{\an1}This is Devin Taggart
from Cain Was Able.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.518
It's a band. They're playing
at the After Dark this week.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.561
{\an1}Mm...

05:11.644 --> 05:13.229
I sure wish you
would've called.

05:13.312 --> 05:15.481
Well, it was so late,
I didn't want to wake you.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.233
I left a message this morning,
but you were out.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.402
Yeah, I was getting
the house ready for Kelly.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.903
{\an3}She's gonna be
staying for a while.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.240
Um... I-I told Devin

05:24.323 --> 05:26.367
he could crash here before
he goes back to Los Feliz.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.536
David,
it's Kelly's first day home.

05:29.537 --> 05:32.290
He just, he got in a fight
with his girlfriend.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.042
Hey, really, look,

05:34.125 --> 05:35.418
{\an1}I won't be long.
Just point me to the shower.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.003
{\an1}It's down the hall,
I think.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.963
{\an3}You know what? You can
crash in Clare's old room.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.423
{\an3}It's the first
door on the left.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.925
Thanks.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.928
Don't be mad, okay?
I really need this.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.639
Donna, I don't mind.
Really.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.435
Just help me make the bed.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.442
{\an3}(groans) Look, you got a full
house here; I'm gonna...

05:59.525 --> 06:00.777
So let's take a walk.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.570
I don't think it's
such a good idea.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.448
I mean, last time we did that,
it wasn't such a crowd-pleaser.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.284
{\an1}That's the good thing
about amnesia.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.203
{\an1}I have no idea who I'm
supposed to please,

06:10.286 --> 06:11.788
so I just please myself.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.915
(chuckles)
Okay.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.797
{\an1}Your friends must be happy
you're back on the mainland.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.131
I can't speak for them.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.509
No? How about your family?

06:24.592 --> 06:27.303
Well, I thought
I'd treat this

06:27.387 --> 06:29.138
{\an3}like it was a brand-new
town, you know?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.182
{\an3}Give it the benefit
of the doubt.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.184
I like the way
you look at life.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.311
I try not to look.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.646
{\an3}(wry laugh)

06:36.729 --> 06:38.272
{\an3}Maybe I should be
more like you--

06:38.356 --> 06:41.442
{\an3}stop worrying
about the past,

06:41.526 --> 06:44.112
{\an3}start focusing on
what I'm going to do,

06:44.195 --> 06:45.655
where I'm going to live.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.324
You lived with Brandon.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.452
{\an3}I used to.

06:51.536 --> 06:55.456
Look, Kelly, I like you,
but we're nothing alike.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.208
I mean, you've got
a good life here.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.335
I can see that.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.419
Can't you?

07:02.421 --> 07:04.632
I'm trying.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.509
{\an1}I know it must be scary
to wake up

07:06.592 --> 07:09.345
and find out you lived
with a guy you don't even know.

07:11.305 --> 07:14.517
They say we love each other.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.437
I just don't remember
what it was like.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.357
How it works.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.235
How I mix that with...

07:24.318 --> 07:26.779
feelings you might be having
for someone else.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.614
You think about what you'd lose.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.283
I know it's hard to do that

07:30.366 --> 07:33.202
if you can't remember
what you've already had.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.704
But don't you want to know?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.539
Of course I do.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.875
{\an1}Well, I mean, isn't that
what you really want--

07:38.958 --> 07:40.751
to figure things out
with Brandon?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.218
Yeah.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.804
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Mrs. Harvey loved the suit,</i>
<i>hated the cocktail dress.</i>

07:51.888 --> 07:52.889
{\an1}Okay.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.099
So I thought I could try
something more like this.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.267
{\an1}All right.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.852
{\an3}By the way, I got
a new client.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.770
You ever heard of
Cooper Hargrove?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.063
Cooper Hargrove?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.273
Where do I know that name?

08:02.356 --> 08:04.734
Is he some, like, old aerospace
millionaire or something?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.736
{\an3}I don't know.
I never met him.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.406
But he needs a party planned
for 200 of his closest friends.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.909
{\an3}Now, I know it's not personal
shopping, technically.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.535
{\an1}But he's paying us, right?
No sweat.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.078
{\an1}You know,
running the After Dark

08:16.162 --> 08:17.705
{\an1}was like hosting
one big, long party.

08:17.788 --> 08:18.831
Yeah, we'll work
on it tomorrow.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.209
Turns out that a client of
mine in Mandeville Canyon

08:21.292 --> 08:22.418
is a clothing manufacturer;

08:22.501 --> 08:24.045
wants to look at my
work this afternoon.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.504
{\an1}Mm! A career job!
You go.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.298
Yeah.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.257
STEVE:
<i>We guarantee the</i> Beverly Beat

08:28.341 --> 08:31.177
<i>is the best advertising</i>
<i>you'll ever get.</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:33.721
Yeah, thanks, anyway.

08:35.514 --> 08:37.767
(groans)

08:37.850 --> 08:40.186
{\an3}We're not going to make
it on sales, Bran.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.440
We've got 60 grand
in accounts receivable.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.401
We got one shot
to make this work.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.779
{\an3}I gotta buy some prime
home delivery lists.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.282
Hit our target audience
on their doorstep,

08:53.366 --> 08:54.617
their haunts, everywhere.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.578
Hey, Bran,
are you with me on this?

08:57.662 --> 09:01.958
Here's the problem, Steve:
I...

09:02.041 --> 09:03.751
I got ideas;
I got tons of ideas,

09:03.834 --> 09:06.796
but we got no statement
holding this paper together.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.465
We got nothing
that sets us apart.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.969
{\an1}Kel.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.971
{\an4}Hi.
STEVE:
Hi, Kel.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.305
Am I interrupting?

09:16.389 --> 09:17.723
No, no, come on in.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.311
It's after 6:00.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.021
I thought maybe
you'd be done.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.273
Is everything okay?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.525
Yeah... yeah.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.193
I just need
to be with you.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.447
I thought maybe we could have
dinner when you're through.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.367
I'm through.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.663
{\an1}You get back on the phone--
sell, sell, sell.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.206
{\an1}STEVE:
Yeah, go, go, go.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.676
Whew...

09:53.759 --> 09:56.470
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.848
How can I not hire you?
What?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.474
Just because we aren't ready
to start our in-house design,

10:00.558 --> 10:01.559
I'm going to let you
walk out of here?

10:01.642 --> 10:03.769
{\an1}I don't know.
Hell, no.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.479
I'm going to buy
these designs piecemeal.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.356
I don't believe this.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.650
Finance works for me,
not the other way around.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.320
Maybe we can structure

10:12.403 --> 10:14.655
some sort
of freelance thing as well.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.073
I'll call you next week.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.326
Oh, this is
such a big break for me.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.201
Thank you so much,
Mr. Parish.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.204
I believe in raw talent.
Mmm.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.415
Diane will show you out.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.666
Oh, that's okay.
I know the way.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.045
{\an1}Oh.
(laughing)

10:29.128 --> 10:31.380
Thanks.
Don't forget your book.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.923
Oh.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.550
I may be tempted to steal
from it if you leave it.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.427
Yeah.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.054
Thanks.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.849
Bye, Donna.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.353
(man speaking in Spanish
in distance)

10:49.565 --> 10:50.900
{\an3}Excuse me.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.777
{\an1}It hurts,
it hurts, Eluvia.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.195
Marta, come quick.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.363
Oh my God, your arm.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.906
Wait!

10:56.989 --> 10:59.033
(girl and her mother continue
conversing in Spanish)

11:06.332 --> 11:07.708
Are you okay?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.585
{\an3}Did you get that from
working on the steam press?

11:11.003 --> 11:12.254
We have to get her
to a doctor.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.339
No help; I do.

11:20.012 --> 11:20.971
Wait.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.771
{\an3}Okay, living room's
over there.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.190
{\an5}Kitchen's over
there, dining...
I'd like to see our room.

11:33.901 --> 11:34.777
You sure?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.946
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.992
It's your home.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.786
How long have you lived here?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.413
Eight years.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.956
{\an3}We moved here from...
Minnesota, I know.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.291
Ah, you listened.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.460
Such a good date.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.175
This is it.

12:03.222 --> 12:07.184
{\an3}This, uh, this
wallpaper over here...

12:07.268 --> 12:11.272
this was the wallpaper, uh...
you picked out

12:11.355 --> 12:12.773
and, uh, you know, at first,

12:12.857 --> 12:14.442
{\an3}I didn't like it
but, uh, you know,

12:14.525 --> 12:16.819
{\an3}it's kind of starting
to grow on me.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.654
I think maybe you should, uh,

12:18.737 --> 12:20.448
{\an3}wallpaper the
whole house with it.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.825
{\an1}Yeah, you wallpaper
my car...

12:22.908 --> 12:24.368
wallpaper me...

12:29.290 --> 12:30.666
Kel?

12:38.090 --> 12:41.302
I thought if I just...

12:41.385 --> 12:42.678
saw our room...

12:42.761 --> 12:45.681
{\an3}Hey, it's okay;
there's no pressure here.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.142
{\an1}I can't be here, Brandon.
I have to go.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.477
No, no, Kel, wait.
No, now.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.854
Just take me home, okay?
Now.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.699
{\an3}Val, whatever you do,
don't tell Hargrove

13:03.782 --> 13:06.535
{\an3}we've never planned
a party before, okay?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.370
MAN (in distance):
...it was only a little late...

13:08.454 --> 13:10.498
{\an5}MAN 2:
I don't need your excuses.
Listen to me...

13:10.581 --> 13:12.166
{\an1}Thank you.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.918
{\an1}Where's this
guy's assistant?

13:14.001 --> 13:16.212
Look at Hargrove-- he can't
treat people like that.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.881
I'm telling you...!

13:18.964 --> 13:20.257
You know, 200
hand-written invitations.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.383
I mean, can you sue
for tendonitis?

13:21.467 --> 13:24.428
You know, I think we should
really pad Hargrove's bill.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.223
I wouldn't pad the bill,
if I were you.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.517
About dessert...

13:29.600 --> 13:30.351
What, Hargrove's cheap, too?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.228
Too? In addition to what?

13:32.311 --> 13:34.230
Did you see him torturing
that poor chef over there?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.440
(arguing continues)

13:36.524 --> 13:37.816
She doesn't mean
to criticize your boss.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.237
Excuse me, Mr. Hargrove?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.572
{\an1}KELLY:
You're Hargrove?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.573
Oh, no.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.867
{\an1}Uh, yes?
There's a call for you.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.410
HARGROVE:
I'll be right there.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.913
{\an3}Frederick--

13:50.996 --> 13:53.040
the older gentleman--
my assistant.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.584
We're fired, right?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.253
{\an3}No, you're doing
a great job.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.546
Dessert menu looks great.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.256
Why don't you come

14:00.339 --> 14:02.758
to the party tonight
and enjoy it?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.468
Oh, we couldn't.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.054
I mean, at least I can't.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.264
Um, neither can I.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.473
I have previous plans.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.933
But thanks.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.269
Um, I hope I didn't offend you.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.436
Oh, you didn't.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.021
Not for lack of trying, though.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.277
Okay, he's nice.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.486
He's handsome.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.988
He's rich, you turned him down.
Why?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.365
I know. What a shock, huh?

14:26.448 --> 14:28.909
You must really
have it bad for Noah.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.369
Mm-hmm.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.627
{\an3}I think you guys have
some great ideas,

14:38.711 --> 14:43.465
but I've got another offer
with an established paper, so...

14:43.549 --> 14:45.175
{\an1}So take it.
Brandon?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.468
What? Let's be honest here.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.345
{\an1}We don't even know if
we're going to go press.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.472
{\an1}We can pay you for this issue,
but there's no money

14:50.556 --> 14:51.473
in the till for the next one.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.809
All we can offer you
is more input in this job

14:53.892 --> 14:55.436
than you've ever had in any job.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.604
Take it or leave it.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.316
I'll take it.
You will?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.151
{\an3}Yes, I mean,
you're honest.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.527
That's the point of
journalism, right?

15:03.611 --> 15:06.405
And besides, I like you guys.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.617
I say let's give it a shot.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.993
Great. Welcome aboard.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.995
{\an1}By the way, we only
have half the ads

15:13.078 --> 15:14.622
and three-quarters of the
articles ready for layout.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.539
{\an1}STEVE:
And, uh,

15:15.623 --> 15:17.374
we still need a printer,

15:17.458 --> 15:19.168
and the deadline's
end of the day tomorrow.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.169
We all make coffee.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.503
We all answer phones.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.423

15:26.425 --> 15:27.509
If one of us gets sick,

15:27.593 --> 15:29.511
{\an1}the other two
promise to visit.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.805

Yeah, but for how many days?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.407

Carly, what are

one long name.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.888
"Carly-What-Are-You-Doing-Here."

16:54.972 --> 16:56.557
{\an1}That's a mouthful.
Just a nickname

socialize like
a real girl.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.769

go find someone

word is "no."

in the neighborhood.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.363

to catch up on biz

He told me you were
working down here.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.330
{\an1}Yeah, I've been working
on her all week.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.706
The owner's out of town.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.459
{\an1}He wants her seaworthy
by the time he gets back.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.883
This is the shirt you wore
when we went swimming, remember?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.093
Yeah.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.344
Brought some
stuff over.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.680
{\an3}I figured I'm spending
so much time here,

I might as well
just crash here.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.684
Yeah, I get it-- you're busy.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.563
{\an1}So I'm taking her
for a test run tonight.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.148
{\an1}You know, while
the water's calm.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.445
I'll catch you later.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.906

19:17.990 --> 19:19.533

It's not Kelly.
Then what is it?

Why are you treating me
like this?

23:08.762 --> 23:10.806
I mean, what can she

23:10.889 --> 23:12.474
mean to him
if you're feeling half

23:12.557 --> 23:14.059
of what I'm feeling
when I'm with you?

23:14.142 --> 23:15.811
Look, it's enough,
all right?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.687
I'm warning you.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.147
Where was she, where was she

23:19.231 --> 23:20.816
the night you made love
to me, huh?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.317
{\an3}Hawaii?

23:22.400 --> 23:24.194
{\an3}Then why did
you move here?

23:24.277 --> 23:26.488
And if she's here, then why were
you living in Hawaii?

23:26.571 --> 23:29.658
She was here.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.536
Past tense?

23:33.787 --> 23:35.831
What... what, she dumped you?

23:35.914 --> 23:38.166
Look, just get out of here
and leave me alone.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.334
{\an3}Okay, so, Noah Hunter,
Mr. Stud

23:39.417 --> 23:41.044
got dumped. So what?

23:41.128 --> 23:43.672
I wish she had dumped me.

23:43.755 --> 23:47.300
Oh... oh, so, so you dumped her.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.512
{\an3}Okay, you broke
her heart.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.013
You know what, Noah?
Get over it, okay?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.515
Get on with your life.
She'll live.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.183
No, she won't live, okay?!

23:55.267 --> 23:56.518
She won't ever live again!

23:56.601 --> 23:59.354
{\an1}She won't ever...
open her eyes again!

24:00.480 --> 24:03.650
I lost control
of the car...

24:03.733 --> 24:06.820
She's bleeding, and her...

24:06.903 --> 24:10.532
We're up here running away from
my family and my friends!

24:10.615 --> 24:15.370
All I want is for someone to
just come by and help her.

24:15.453 --> 24:19.708
Just help her.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.542
Oh, my God.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.086
Not that I...

24:23.170 --> 24:24.629
She died?

24:26.965 --> 24:30.677
Here?

24:30.760 --> 24:33.388
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.015
Look, just leave me alone!

24:35.098 --> 24:37.434
Get out of here!

24:41.313 --> 24:43.315
{\an1}Damn you!
Get out of here!

24:58.121 --> 24:59.706
(people conversing in Spanish)

25:09.174 --> 25:10.258
Hi. Excuse me.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.301
{\an3}Do you remember me?
I'm Donna Martin.

25:11.384 --> 25:11.968
{\an3}I was wondering
what happened

25:12.052 --> 25:13.178
{\an3}to that girl
that got burned.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.054
She better.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.722
Can I talk to her?
You make trouble.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.098
{\an3}No, please,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.100
will you please wait?
Look, she's way too small

25:19.184 --> 25:20.602
to be operating
that big steam press.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.604
That's why she got hurt.
How old is she?

25:22.687 --> 25:24.272
She work hard. Now no work.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.357
And doctor bills.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.567
{\an3}Well, the owner should be
paying workman's comp.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.278
{\an3}They can't get away with
less in this country.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.573
How many hours a day
do you work?

25:35.033 --> 25:36.785
Look, minimum wage
is $5.15 an hour.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.411
How much do they pay you?

25:38.495 --> 25:41.790
{\an1}Not enough to lose job
because of you.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.920
(sighs)

25:49.881 --> 25:51.716
STEVE:
Okay, this one's mine.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.301
{\an1}Nat, Carly,
this is Terri Spar,

25:53.385 --> 25:54.636
{\an4}Hi, Terri.
our fearless
production manager.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.679
Hi. Nice to meet you.

25:55.762 --> 25:56.638
Nice to meet you, too.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.139
{\an3}Thanks for the sandwiches.
Appreciate it.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.266
So this is <i> Beverly Beat?</i>

25:59.349 --> 26:00.767
Do you have time
to show us around?

26:00.850 --> 26:02.686
{\an1}Well, I'd like to,
but we're on a deadline.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.812
Maybe some other time?

26:03.895 --> 26:05.021
Sure. That'd be great.
Whenever.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.736
{\an3}So, uh, you gonna get this pup
out the door tonight?

26:11.820 --> 26:12.946
We have to.
We got a deadline.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.615
I've got all the ads I can,
and now it's up to Brandon.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.783
It's in his corner now.

26:16.866 --> 26:17.826
That's not
what you just told Carly

26:17.909 --> 26:19.619
when you sent her back
to <i> her</i> corner.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.663
{\an3}Hey, Carly.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.164
{\an1}They got you
making deliveries?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.833
Yes, these are
some busy boys.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.043
Mm-hmm. Excuse me.
Okay.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.503
Brandon.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.046
{\an3}Hey, Donna.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.799
Hey, I think
I got a story for you.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.342
Is it short?
I'm on a deadline.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.678
Well, I'll make it fast
and hope it has a happy ending.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.221
What do you know
about sweatshops?

26:40.640 --> 26:42.642
I'm listening.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.478
{\an1}NAT: Luckily, some girls
don't know how

26:45.562 --> 26:46.688
to take no for an answer.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.649
{\an1}She sure is good
at saying it, though.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.026
Meet you down at the car.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.777
I'll be right there.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.617
(exasperated sigh)
I don't get this.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.579
Uh, just because I don't want to
date you, we can't be friends?

27:02.662 --> 27:04.706
I didn't think you wanted me
hitting on you

27:04.789 --> 27:05.832
because you don't date.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.334
Because of Zach.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.710
And then, all of a sudden,

27:08.793 --> 27:10.587
I see you out at some bar.
What's that?

27:10.670 --> 27:12.922
I have a kid.
I'm not a shut-in.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.382
Oh, okay, I see.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.551
Well, why don't you want
to go out with me, then?

27:16.634 --> 27:20.388
Because... I'm not your type.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.223
And I don't think that

27:22.307 --> 27:24.726
you're right for me either
because of-of Zach.

27:24.809 --> 27:27.270
So what kind of guy gets
to date you?

27:27.354 --> 27:30.065
I'm just wondering,
as a friend.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.859
Well, I mean, he doesn't have
to be rich or anything,

27:32.942 --> 27:34.944
just stable, patient,

27:35.028 --> 27:35.904
responsible...

27:35.987 --> 27:37.364
That word again.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.741
So how come you're not
with some Mr. Responsible?

27:39.824 --> 27:42.369
Actually, I would be tonight,
but my mom's sick

27:42.452 --> 27:43.787
and I don't have a sitter.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.747
A date? Is this serious?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.457
No, it's only the first date.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.542
I mean,
he's just some guy I met.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.086
Well, if Mr. Right comes
knocking at the door

27:51.169 --> 27:52.670
like some census taker,
you better answer it.

27:53.671 --> 27:54.798
I'll watch Zach for you.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.133
Oh, no, thank you, really.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.259
It's, it's nice, but...

27:58.343 --> 28:00.261
No, really,
I'll watch him for you.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.264
I'll be done here
in an hour or so,

28:03.348 --> 28:04.766
for better or for worse,

28:04.849 --> 28:06.810
{\an1}and, well, I'll be giving you
a shot at marital bliss.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.604
{\an1}Think of me
as your fairy godmother.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.731
{\an3}That image is too good
to pass up.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.150
7:00? You know the place?

28:14.234 --> 28:14.943
Yeah.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.069
{\an3}BRANDON:
Do you remember?

28:16.152 --> 28:17.946
{\an3}Do you have the address
of the building somewhere?

28:18.029 --> 28:20.281
One hour to deadline, guys.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.742
{\an1}Look, we got to do something
to help these people.

28:22.826 --> 28:23.618
We will-- next issue.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.286
With more information,

28:25.370 --> 28:26.830
{\an3}okay?
Okay.

28:47.725 --> 28:51.646
Brandon said you came by.

28:51.729 --> 28:53.314
So you're just taking off?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.442
Going back to Hawaii?

28:55.525 --> 28:56.901
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.071
So you're just going
to keep going backwards?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.157
Look, I'm just taking a job,
okay?

29:02.240 --> 29:03.533
Away from me.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.912
What was her name?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.211
Beth.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.676
Her name...

29:21.759 --> 29:22.677
{\an3}I think
you should go.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.845
Don't tell me to go.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.056
Don't say anything
you don't mean.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.643
{\an3}Look, I don't... I can't
do this, all right?

29:30.727 --> 29:32.520
I don't...

29:32.604 --> 29:34.689
I don't want to do this.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.859
But you do.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.444
You can't help it.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.531
Neither can I.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.717
Hey.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.676
{\an3}You like?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.719
Oh, yeah, it's gorgeous.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.387
{\an3}Oh, good.
Put it on.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.264
{\an3}Hurry up.
Don't ask any questions.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.269
{\an1}All right.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.896
{\an1}Take that.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.942
Let's jump to the back.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.112
{\an1}Does your mom always take
this long to get ready?

30:25.323 --> 30:28.034
Wow, you look beautiful...

30:28.117 --> 30:31.287
{\an1}uh, said the Fairy Godmother
to Cinderella.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.747
{\an3}Bed, 8:00.

30:32.830 --> 30:33.748
8:15

30:33.831 --> 30:34.916
And no arguing.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.084
I didn't say a word.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.585
No, I meant with Zach.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.586
He'll win, won't you?

30:40.338 --> 30:42.382
Uh, do I look okay?

30:45.134 --> 30:46.886
Um, I don't want
Kurt to come in.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.097
It's too confusing for Zach.
You know, the whole date thing?

30:49.180 --> 30:50.390
So don't even
get into it.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.559
Mommy's friend's here.
Give it up.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.233
Bye, sweetie.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.651
So you're clear
on everything?

31:01.734 --> 31:04.320
Oh, yeah. If I get confused,
I can always refer

31:04.404 --> 31:05.947
to the three pages
of typed notes

31:06.030 --> 31:08.157
{\an1}you left me.
Bye, guys. Have fun.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.784
{\an3}CARLY:
Thanks.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.250
(goofy voice):
I guess it's just you and me.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.085
Who said that?

31:19.168 --> 31:21.796
Who?

31:21.879 --> 31:24.465
I bet your mom wishes

31:24.549 --> 31:26.634
she was here with us

31:26.718 --> 31:28.469
instead of that old
what's-his-name.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.097
I wish she was out with you.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.474
Oh, buddy...

31:33.558 --> 31:35.810
Buddy, give me some skin.

31:35.893 --> 31:37.604
{\an1}Let me see your Belly Man.
(laughs)

31:37.687 --> 31:40.940
{\an3}How did you pull
this off?

31:41.024 --> 31:43.985
With a little help
from your friends.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.653
{\an3}You guys have
a good time now.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.655
{\an1}Yep, knock
yourselves out.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.157
Thanks, guys.

31:51.618 --> 31:55.163
{\an3}Hey, look, um...
I gotta get to the club.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.123
But tomorrow...

31:57.206 --> 31:59.834
{\an3}the deck,
the day, the night...

32:01.419 --> 32:02.837
...they're ours, all right?

32:02.920 --> 32:04.047
Just you and me.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.299
Okay.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.678
{\an3}Cheers.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.181
And to you.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.390
{\an3}Thanks.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.731
I've been thinking about you.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.901
{\an1}I started
to really remember things.

32:24.984 --> 32:30.698
And I just sort of get them
mixed up with who you are now.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.327
I've been, uh...
remembering you, too.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.704
When you were

32:36.788 --> 32:41.501
lying there in the hospital,
I'd look at you,

32:41.584 --> 32:44.712
and things would
just kind of hit me.

32:44.796 --> 32:45.922
Like what?

32:46.005 --> 32:48.675
Little things.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.760
Like how you hang your stockings
in the shower to dry...

32:52.512 --> 32:54.055
...the first time we danced.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.557
When was that?

32:56.641 --> 32:59.394
It was a high school dance.

33:00.853 --> 33:05.566
You see, I don't dance, so you
dragged me onto the dance floor.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.194
We were just friends then.

33:08.277 --> 33:12.657
But I put my arms around you.

quietly in background)

we just kind of stood there.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.637
{\an3}Like this.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.305
{\an3}(chuckles)

33:36.389 --> 33:38.433

Mm-hmm.

33:58.661 --> 33:59.912
STEVE:
And no kiss.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.330
Well, get
in your car, buddy.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.832
Save your self-respect.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.293
That, my good boy,
was a total date wipeout.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.838
You've got to get in
your bed right away.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.172
All right.
Go.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.844
Hi.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.638
Hi, dear.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.516
How was your date?

34:20.600 --> 34:21.809
He sells insurance

34:21.893 --> 34:24.478
and gambles his salary
in Las Vegas.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.607
A walking, snoring oxymoron.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.650
So much for Mr. Responsible.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.152
Zach's in bed?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.487
Oh, yeah.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.322
He went right in--
no complaints.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.697
Hmm.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.415
{\an3}He sure is cute
when he's asleep.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.139
{\an3}Did you have a
good night, Zach?

35:00.223 --> 35:02.517
{\an3}Yeah?

35:02.600 --> 35:03.643
Did Steve behave himself?

35:06.479 --> 35:07.730
Anything broken?

35:07.814 --> 35:10.525
Toys? Glassware? Bones?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.652
{\an3}(Steve chuckling)
You sure?

35:12.735 --> 35:14.403
{\an3}It's your last chance
to blame Steve.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.531
He was a good boy.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.532
{\an1}CARLY:
Yeah?

35:17.615 --> 35:19.450
So are you.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.870
Good night, sweetheart.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.918
He must've just woke up.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.219
Thank you...

35:38.302 --> 35:39.554
{\an3}for a really
great evening.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.806
{\an1}Well, how about
a kiss good night?

35:41.889 --> 35:43.891
{\an3}I'll give one to
Zach for you.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.208
Brandon was here.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.293
They did it.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.545
{\an1}Is that the paper?
Let me see.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.257
{\an3}KELLY:
Look, he's lead editorial.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.440
I love you.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.567
I love you, too. I do.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.741
Kelly?

36:41.824 --> 36:43.993
Mom, where's my...
Kelly, what is it?

36:44.076 --> 36:47.413
I'm missing something.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.916
But I know what it is.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.428
{\an1}Oh, Val,
here's your paycheck.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.013
And Cooper Hargrove called.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.307
{\an1}He thought we did
a great job on the party.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.518
He specifically
asked for you.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.520
{\an1}Well, I should be happy
about it.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.189
{\an1}I should want
to go out with him.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.357
{\an3}By the way,

37:14.440 --> 37:16.984
Kelly had an incredible night
with Brandon last night.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.319
So if you're worried about Noah,

37:18.402 --> 37:20.112
I'd say the playing field
is wide open.

37:20.196 --> 37:23.616
Have you ever slept on a boat?

37:23.699 --> 37:25.368
Yeah, my parents'--
a bunch of times.

37:25.451 --> 37:26.953
Did you ever feel
a little cramped?

37:27.036 --> 37:28.496
Well, it's a pretty big.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.664
But you wouldn't want
to live there, right?

37:29.747 --> 37:32.708
I don't know.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.211
But Noah...
he just loves it.

37:37.254 --> 37:39.465
You know, I ran out on him
this morning because...

37:39.548 --> 37:41.842
because I wanted him too much.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.386
Maybe you're just scared.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.470
{\an3}He's poor.

37:44.553 --> 37:47.390
He has no ambition.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.350
But why do I want him?

37:51.394 --> 37:55.272
Look, Val, I don't know
exactly what makes you happy...

37:55.356 --> 37:58.859
but if you're lucky enough
to find it, hold on to it.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.321
Speaking of which,

38:02.405 --> 38:04.865
{\an1}I have an actual date
with David tonight, so...

38:04.949 --> 38:07.368
So, in other words...

38:07.451 --> 38:08.536
same advice as before:

38:08.619 --> 38:11.038
"Just don't wreck it."

38:11.122 --> 38:13.082
You can do that, can't you?

38:13.165 --> 38:14.542
Honestly?

38:14.625 --> 38:18.045
I don't know.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.522
♪ I feel the pressure cooker
burning in my soul ♪

38:36.605 --> 38:38.566
♪ Something's grabbed

38:38.649 --> 38:40.568

{\an3}Hey, hey, guys, um...
Can...?

38:48.576 --> 38:51.579
{\an3}(turns music off)
Do you mind?

38:51.662 --> 38:53.956
{\an3}Thanks.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.708
{\an3}Oh, great.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.256
Hey, Donna,
come on in.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.341
Thanks.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.512
Look, they-they just
showed up, all right?

39:08.596 --> 39:09.764
I didn't ask them to stay.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.433
Where's Kelly?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.477
She left a note.
She went somewhere with her mom.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.270
She said she wasn't
going to be back today.

39:16.353 --> 39:18.606
Oh, so we could actually have
the whole afternoon alone?

39:18.689 --> 39:20.483
You did want
to be alone with me.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.358
(groans)

39:21.442 --> 39:23.778
Yeah,
but what am I supposed to do?

39:23.861 --> 39:25.696
Tell them to leave.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.324
Donna, they could sign with
an established manager tomorrow.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.452
Hey, guys, I'm gonna send Billy
to get some more beer.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.661
Do you need anything?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.413
No, I have dinner
right here.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.249
Chilean sea bass,
new potatoes, champagne...

39:37.333 --> 39:39.752
We're just gonna
stay in tonight.

39:39.835 --> 39:40.961
Ah, don't cook. We'll order in.

39:41.045 --> 39:41.962
Is Thai okay with you guys?
I'm buying.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.173
Won't your girlfriend be angry?

39:44.256 --> 39:45.424
Okay, so I'll invite her.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.928
Uh, why don't you get started on
those contracts, all right?

39:49.011 --> 39:51.972
Well, congratulations.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.100
You're now in bed
with these guys.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.309
(sighs heavily)

39:55.393 --> 39:57.853
I'd rather be in bed with you.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.025
I'll... I'll-I'll ask them
to leave.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.986
You can't do that.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.446
I know that.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.823
You know that, too.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.950
I love you.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.496
DEVIN: Listen, I know
what I'm signing okay?

40:15.579 --> 40:17.498
{\an3}Didn't you hear me?
No one's gonna Jew me down.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.291
No one's gonna Jew
me down, all right?

40:19.375 --> 40:21.335
{\an3}Just trust me, I know what
I'm doing, all right?

40:21.418 --> 40:22.503
Just get over here.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.680
You missed a great
dinner party last night.

40:32.763 --> 40:36.183
And I appreciated you
calling to follow up.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.019
Well, it was really nice of you
to extend a second invitation.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.606
Well, I got the feeling
maybe you were off the market.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.402
But I thought it was worth
a second try.

40:46.485 --> 40:47.528
Well worth it.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.531
Well, I like someone
who's not afraid of a challenge.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.117
Missed opportunities,
that's all I'm afraid of.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.996
I bet nothing scares you.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.664
Really?

40:58.747 --> 41:01.750
Well, you'd be surprised.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.884
{\an3}(laughing)

41:09.967 --> 41:11.260
{\an1}We did it!

41:11.343 --> 41:13.512
{\an3}You rule, Terri!
We did it.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.514
{\an3}And Brandon--
taskmaster,

41:15.598 --> 41:16.724
{\an3}editor, word king,
thesaurus--

41:16.807 --> 41:19.351
you got it all, man!
Now all we have to do is

41:19.435 --> 41:21.562
the same thing next week,
only better.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.230
{\an1}Oh, and faster.
(phone rings)

41:23.314 --> 41:25.858
<i>Beverly Beat</i> Sales.

41:25.941 --> 41:28.569
{\an3}Yes, yes, there is space
in the next issue.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.905
Perhaps you could, uh...

41:30.988 --> 41:32.573
{\an3}You would?
Monthly rate, yeah.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.241
{\an3}You know what?
Why don't you come in?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.451
We're right here on...

41:35.534 --> 41:36.952
You know where it is!

41:37.036 --> 41:38.454
{\an3}Great.
Thank you very much.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.414
(phone rings)

41:40.498 --> 41:41.624
{\an1}STEVE:
Hello?

41:41.707 --> 41:43.375
{\an3}STEVE:
Yes, as a matter of fact,

41:43.459 --> 41:44.627
{\an1}there is space
in the next issue.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.794
Perhaps you'd
like to, uh...

41:47.171 --> 41:49.590
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.550
{\an3}I know how you are
when you're writing.

41:51.634 --> 41:55.721
The way you push your chair
back and pull on your ear.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.100
You remember?

42:00.184 --> 42:01.644
I remember you.

42:03.646 --> 42:05.564
I reached for my ring...

42:07.900 --> 42:09.443
...for <i> our</i> ring...

42:09.527 --> 42:10.945
but I didn't have it.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.780
You have it.

42:14.573 --> 42:17.618
{\an3}It's all coming
back to me, Brandon.

42:20.037 --> 42:24.625
{\an3}But without you, I feel
more lost than ever.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.894
You know what, Kel?

42:45.854 --> 42:47.982
{\an1}The next time
I put this on you,

42:48.065 --> 42:50.901
{\an1}I want it to be
for the rest of your life.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.617
Can we go home?
