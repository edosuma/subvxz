Door‐to‐door, less is more.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.209
‐ I don't knows about that.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.793
Door knockings could be
all sorts of awkwards.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.005
‐ No, it's a great opportunity to catch up
on your small town banter as well.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.549
You ever notice you never get
a straight answer out of anybody

08:27.549 --> 08:29.968
in a small town
when you ask 'em how they're doing?

08:29.968 --> 08:31.136
I like that.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.096
‐ Door knocking can become
hostile as well.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.183
Like if it's suppertime,
or folks are busy getting busy. [chuckles]

08:36.183 --> 08:38.393
‐ That's why there needs to be
a strategy in place, Dary.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.603
‐ Go on.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.523
‐ Urgency.
‐ I'm listening.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.024
‐ Dary, give me your wallet real quick.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.319
‐ See?
‐ See what?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.570
‐ Take it back.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.365
Dary, give me your wallet.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.784
‐ But you just gave it back to me.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.118
‐ Dary, give me your wallet real quick.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.622
‐ See?
‐ I believes I do.

08:58.622 --> 09:02.459
‐ By adding "real quick"
to the interaction, it creates urgency.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.877
So people are less prone to think.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.129
They just do.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.506
‐ That is incredible. Wow.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.508
I mean, the urgency was right there.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.760
‐ And I just gotta get‐‐
‐ Dary, shut the fuck up real quick.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.762
Point and proof.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.849
Well...

09:18.350 --> 09:19.726
Hick‐talk, start the clock.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.939
‐ Penny for your thoughts, Jim?

09:23.939 --> 09:26.441
‐ I was just thinking I ought to change
the runner on my skid steer.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.570
‐ Sorry, no. I meant,
can you spare a penny or two?

09:29.570 --> 09:31.405
‐ I can spare one, two, three,
looking at four dollars...

09:31.405 --> 09:33.448
[auctioneer calling]

09:33.448 --> 09:35.158
Sold! But it don't come free.
What for?

09:35.158 --> 09:37.911
‐ I'm collecting for Don Cherry's
Pet Rescue Foundation.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.913
‐ I give annually to Noah's Bark.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.666
‐ Get off your wallet, Dickskin.
‐ It's Dickins!

09:42.666 --> 09:44.251
‐ What's in your jeans, Dickskin?

09:44.251 --> 09:47.004
‐ It's a good thing this Dickskin's
got thick skin, Gail.

09:48.881 --> 09:49.882
What's the damage?

09:49.882 --> 09:51.466
‐ Two‐dollar highballs.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.136
But for you, call it a buck 99.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.139
‐ Keep the change.
Your tip.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.184
Tip's my favorite part.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.476
‐ That's insane.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.022
GAIL:
I'd like to Aaron Taylor his Johnson.

10:05.022 --> 10:05.981
‐ What?

10:05.981 --> 10:08.567
‐ I'd like to Dwayne "The Rock"
his Johnson.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.320
‐ [sighs] Well, at least you got a penny
for his thoughts.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.199
‐ This'll get the rig rolling.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.619
Listen up, y'all!

10:18.619 --> 10:21.371
Buck 99 highballs till midnight.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.372
Bonnie!

10:22.372 --> 10:24.249
‐ Grab your friends, buy a round!

10:25.459 --> 10:27.294
‐ That's one strategy, Katy‐Kat.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.379
‐ That's a drop in the bucket, though.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.589
Pun intended.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.758
‐ You okay with a little white lie,
Miss Katy?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.177
‐ A little white lie never hurt anyone.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.261
GAIL: Here's the scoop.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.514
Most people like to give

10:38.514 --> 10:42.017
'cause it makes them, mm, feel good.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.603
So we gotta be penny‐wise,

10:44.603 --> 10:45.979
make it easy for 'em.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.147
‐ 'Kay.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.566
‐ Not everyone one gives a shit
about animal rescue.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.403
You got the Thibodeaus and their kind
dragging sick cows around the yard

10:53.403 --> 10:55.155
by a loader and chain, for fuck's sakes.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.573
‐ Fuck you, Thibodeau.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.908
‐ Believe it or not,

10:57.908 --> 11:00.744
some folks aren't too warm
to that fella Don Cherry either.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.204
‐ He's a national treasure.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.415
‐ So, you got to make up a new charity

11:05.415 --> 11:09.127
that pulls, mm, on their heartstrings,

11:09.127 --> 11:11.755
and it'll open up... [pops lips]

11:11.755 --> 11:13.674
...their purse strings.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.051
‐ That's a tad bit <i>scheisty</i>, Gailer.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.970
‐ Who you doing this for?
‐ The animals.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.055
‐ They won't tell.
‐ That's true.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.015
‐ And, this just in: it's fucking pennies.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.393
‐ A little white lie never hurt anyone.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.896
‐ Hey, get off your wallets,
you sousy fucks!

11:27.896 --> 11:29.231
‐ Yeah, you sousy fucks!

11:29.231 --> 11:30.357
‐ Fuck!
‐ Fuck!

11:30.357 --> 11:31.775
GAIL: Fuck!
‐ Fuck!

11:31.775 --> 11:33.443
‐ Hey, you want a drink?

11:35.737 --> 11:36.780
‐ Hello.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.948
‐ I should say.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.992
‐ Good morning to you.
‐ And to you.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.952
‐ It's my chest, isn't it?

11:41.952 --> 11:43.745
‐ Sorry?
‐ My chest?

11:43.745 --> 11:46.373
Just picked it up from a garage sale.
Real conversation piece.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.168
‐ Mm‐hmm.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.878
‐ Same with my jugs.
‐ What's that?

11:50.878 --> 11:54.214
‐ My grandpa makes moonshine,
which those are perfect for.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.509
Can you imagine my grandpa and his buddies
sucking on these jugs?

11:57.509 --> 11:58.802
ALL: No.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.637
‐ How are you now?
ALL: Goods, and youse?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.890
‐ Are you two staring at my girls?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.474
‐ No.
‐ No. Oh, look at you, ceiling.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.185
What's up? You is.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.898
‐ Look, I got some questions for you.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.149
‐ I got some answers.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.443
‐ You ever seen
any of those <i>Naked Gun</i> movies?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.653
‐ No.
‐ No? Okay.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.280
‐ <i>Hot Shots?</i>
‐ Strike <i>deux.</i>

12:18.280 --> 12:20.157
‐ Is that right? Okay.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.075
Well, how do you feel about pet rescue?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.785
WOMAN: How do you feel
about these puppies?

12:25.329 --> 12:27.956
Just rescued these tits a few weeks ago.
‐ [puppies whimper]

12:27.956 --> 12:29.625
Give 'em a little kiss.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.376
‐ The tits?
‐ What else?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.545
WAYNE:
I better not.

12:33.545 --> 12:39.259
Say, I'm collecting so that more...
tits get homes.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.302
‐ What's the charity called?

12:40.302 --> 12:41.595
‐ You ever hear of the United Wayne?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.639
‐ Cute.
‐ Well, I'm just kidding around.

12:43.639 --> 12:46.099
It's actually Don Cherry's
Pet Rescue Foundation.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.393
‐ Good guy, that Don Cherry.
‐ Oh, he's a great guy.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.812
‐ My papa loves him.
Same last name actually.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.899
‐ So, you would call him...?
‐ Papa Cherry.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.734
‐ Yes.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.611
Never seen <i>Airplane!?</i>
<i>Airplane 2?</i>

12:57.611 --> 12:59.571
‐ Strike three.
‐ Oh, that's something.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.115
All right, well,
before I head back to the dugout,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.867
can I grab your spare pennies real quick?

13:03.867 --> 13:05.118
‐ Yeah, I've got a couple of big cans.

13:05.953 --> 13:09.414
A couple big cans that I use for bookends,
but you can have 'em.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.250
‐ Okay.
‐ Here.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.210
You know you'd have these tits
in your hands sooner than later.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.088
‐ No, I didn't, but here they are.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.260
WOMAN: Just wait here,
and I'll bring out my big cans.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.887
‐ That is... incredible.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.681
‐ What, the whole "real quicks" thing?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.474
‐ Well, among other things.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.643
‐ In wrestling terms, that's what we call
a pins in under a minutes.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.145
Or in pro wrestling terms,
what we'ds call a squash match.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.772
‐ She's never seen <i>Airplane!</i>

13:38.527 --> 13:40.237
‐ And one.
WOMAN: Come here.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.489
Hello. Hi.
‐ And two.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.868
[Wayne mutters]

13:45.868 --> 13:47.744
‐ Before you go,
let me get my girls out for you.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.790
Would have been rude of them
not to say goodbye.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.626
Have a great day.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.670
‐ You also have a great day.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.173
[whistles]

13:59.173 --> 14:01.341
‐ That was like taking penny candies
from a babies.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.385
‐ It was kind of...

14:04.344 --> 14:05.679
kind of something, eh?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.139
‐ Dary, give me your beer real quick.

14:12.561 --> 14:16.023
‐ [sighs]
Thanks for supporting the YMCHay.

14:16.023 --> 14:20.110
Word Vision puts books in the hands
of people that need them most.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.571
Thank you.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.908
I'm collecting for Uniself,
to send myself to University,

14:25.908 --> 14:27.826
'cause I need it.

14:28.911 --> 14:29.870
[mouths]
Thank you.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.831
Ladies, hey. Spare your pennies?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.917
Help send kids to Camp Whatchamacallit.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.505
‐ How's it going, pretty kitty?

14:39.505 --> 14:40.923
‐ Well, the dudes are giving steady,

14:40.923 --> 14:43.467
but all the girls are giving me
is stink eye.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.428
‐ Maybe you should arrange
a little something for the ladies.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.308
‐ Gail force strikes again.
Good thinking.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.603
Boys, MoDean's.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.355
'Cause I need backup.

14:56.855 --> 14:57.814
Stat.

14:59.525 --> 15:00.484
[knocking]

15:02.903 --> 15:05.280
‐ Well, well, well,
look at what the cat dragged in.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.865
‐ That's better than
what the cat coughed up.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.243
‐ Right before curiosity killed it.
‐ [both laugh]

15:09.243 --> 15:10.702
Your toesies must be frozies.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.412
‐ Just like my nosies.
How are you now?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.039
‐ Well, I'm about two points
above average.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.749
‐ Well, two is better than one,
last time I checked.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.543
‐ It's a beautiful day out.
Too nice.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.128
‐ Well, I'd complain,
but who would listen? [chuckling]

15:20.128 --> 15:21.338
‐ My wife, Barb, would.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.968
She was an amazing listener.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.932
‐ Tell you what, I'm collecting
pennies for the United Wayne real quick.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.184
‐ Give me a sec.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.020
‐ Tell you what, I'll give you two.
‐Two's better than one.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.025
Here you go.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.861
I was collecting these for Noah's Bark,

15:43.861 --> 15:45.863
but you can have 'em for,
uh, what's it called?

15:45.863 --> 15:47.406
‐ Well, call it the United Wayne.

15:47.406 --> 15:49.199
‐ The United Wayne, of course.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.285
‐ Well, can't thank you enough,
so I'm not gonna try.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.954
‐ Wouldn't even ask you to.
‐ Well, I do take requests.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.207
‐ Well, you could turn up the heat
a couple notches for us.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.792
[both laugh]

15:58.792 --> 16:00.502
‐ Too much fun.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.337
[sighs]

16:03.589 --> 16:05.674
‐ "United Wayne."

16:05.674 --> 16:07.509
He's so full of shit his eyes are brown.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.219
WAYNE:
Your toesies must be frozies.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.470
‐ Just like our nosies.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.139
‐ Let's gosies.
‐ Can confirm.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.308
‐ What's that, Barb?
‐ [car door closes]

16:14.308 --> 16:15.684
Oh, it's no one.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.061
I'll draw you a bath.

16:23.859 --> 16:25.986
‐ Hey, Katy‐Kat.
‐ Came as fast as we could.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.946
‐ If I had a penny
for every time I heard that...

16:27.946 --> 16:31.158
KATY:
Boys, I need you to go table to table,

16:31.158 --> 16:33.869
collecting all the pennies
from all the ladies.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.162
‐ What?
‐ Why?

16:35.162 --> 16:37.539
‐ What is this, W‐fucking‐5?
Do as you're told.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.625
Work those women.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.503
Make up a charity
that tugs on their heartstrings

16:42.503 --> 16:44.421
and loosens up their purse strings.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.798
‐ I don't know.
That sounds a bit <i>scheisty</i>, boys.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.342
‐ It's Mennonite scheisty, bro.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.302
‐ This just in: it's fucking pennies.

16:50.302 --> 16:52.304
KATY: And a little white lie
never hurt anyone.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.347
‐ Yeah, still, we...

16:55.849 --> 16:57.809
Mm... mm.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.438
We'll go talk to girls, boys.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.940
‐ Pennies only.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.900
‐ I'm looking at dimes.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.486
BOTH: Yes, we can.

17:08.946 --> 17:10.948
‐ Is anyone interested in contributing

17:10.948 --> 17:13.992
to the Dollar Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.454
‐ McMurray.
‐ Wayne.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.082
‐ Wayne.
‐ McMurr‐‐ Let's...

17:20.082 --> 17:22.000
Let's just slow this down okay?
I'm gonna start.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.627
‐ And what, say nothing?

17:24.711 --> 17:25.879
‐ McMurray.
‐ Present.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.297
