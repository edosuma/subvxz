01:15.440 --> 01:17.080
Where are you taking me?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.800
Where are you taking me?

01:19.880 --> 01:23.200
<i>Fimbra Control,</i>
<i>Alouette 5 is in range.</i>

01:27.960 --> 01:29.480
Apply the blindfold, please.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.640
Blindfold?

01:30.720 --> 01:33.160
Hell, no! No way!

01:33.240 --> 01:36.800
This enforced incarceration
is unsanctioned, unwarranted,

01:36.880 --> 01:38.320
and unconstitutional!

01:38.400 --> 01:40.160
-What the fuck are you doing?

01:42.440 --> 01:44.440
Ah!

01:46.120 --> 01:47.160
Who is flying this thing?

01:49.240 --> 01:52.160
Fimbra Control,
remote landing sequence has begun.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.720
Hey, hey, man! Hey!

02:13.840 --> 02:15.360
Where are you taking me?

03:09.520 --> 03:10.640
What is this?

03:10.720 --> 03:13.360
In due time, Professor Clark.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.800
No, the time is due. Now is the due time.
Are you gonna kill me?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.720
I'm not scared or nothing.
I'm just curious.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.640
Well, according to the world,
Professor Clark,

03:21.720 --> 03:23.200
you're already dead.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.480
Who are you?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.200
Bruce Baldwin.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.480
Shep Gordon.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.560
I am the one they call Mishu.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.960
And I am Lord Lordington.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.200
Together, we are…

03:46.160 --> 03:47.800
The Pentaverate.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.720
<i> In 1347,</i>
<i>five learned men realized</i>

03:52.800 --> 03:56.320
<i>that the black plague</i>
<i>was caused by fleas on rats.</i>

03:56.400 --> 03:59.560
<i>However, the Church believed</i>
<i>the plague to be God's punishment,</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:02.400
<i>labeling these five men heretics.</i>

04:02.480 --> 04:08.280
<i>So they formed a benevolent secret society</i>
<i>to influence world events, known as</i>

04:09.160 --> 04:10.680
<i>The Pentaverate.</i>

04:11.240 --> 04:15.200
<i>Throughout the centuries,</i>
<i>there have been many secret organizations.</i>

04:15.280 --> 04:17.440
<i>What makes the Pentaverate different?</i>

04:18.400 --> 04:19.520
<i>They're nice.</i>

04:28.600 --> 04:32.280
-<i> You're watching CACA Toronto.</i>

04:33.120 --> 04:34.520
Welcome back.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.200
I'm Darleen Windelchuck.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.560
Hard-hitting and breaking now,

04:38.640 --> 04:43.960
nuclear physicist Professor Hobart Clark
has died of an apparent broken neck.

04:44.040 --> 04:49.000
Oakland Police say Clark died
attempting the "kiss the star" challenge,

04:49.080 --> 04:54.080
the latest Internet craze, where people
are challenged to kiss their own anus.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.400
Professor Clark was 57.

04:58.480 --> 05:03.440
And finally, a report
from Canada's own lovable Ken Scarborough.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.440
Ken Scarborough here
at the Toronto Sportsman Show.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.520
There's plenty of things to do,
whether you're into skeet-shooting…

05:11.760 --> 05:13.280
…or fly-fishing.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.280
Over there's a 1,000-pound bull
made entirely out of butter.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.880
We asked some Torontonians what they
thought of this year's Sportsman Show.

05:22.680 --> 05:26.240
Hey, buddy, why don't you
take off your clothes and bear with me?

05:28.640 --> 05:31.680
What's your favorite part
about this year's Sportsman Show?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.640
Oh my God, you're Ken Scarborough.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.800
Yes, I am.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.440
You're still alive?

05:37.520 --> 05:38.920
I certainly am.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.440
But you must be, like, 100 years old?

05:41.520 --> 05:42.480
You're lucky I don't…

05:42.560 --> 05:45.200
Not tonight, deer. I've got a headache!

05:46.920 --> 05:50.680
I haven't had this much fun
since I was at a nudist colony

05:50.760 --> 05:53.800
and accidentally backed
into a meat thermometer.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.480
But wherever you go at the Sportsman Show,

05:57.200 --> 06:00.840
you're never too far
from a couple of lovely ladies.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.160
Ken Scarborough, CACA News.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.480
From all of us at CACA Toronto News,
good night, and do your best, eh?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.680
<i>Up next, Canada's favorite</i>
<i>quiz show, </i>Close Enough,

06:15.760 --> 06:18.200
<i>where to win, you only have to be…</i>

06:18.280 --> 06:20.080
<i> Close enough!</i>

06:20.160 --> 06:21.920
And we're clear!

06:23.240 --> 06:26.120
Nice job. See you tomorrow.
Great job. See you tomorrow.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.160
Mrs. Snee, what did you think
of my piece tonight?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.720
Ken, we should talk.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.720
It's about time we talk about your future.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.360
Could be a slow process.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.600
Keep it just between us.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.000
What are you saying, boss?

06:38.080 --> 06:40.200
Good luck with the retirement, Ken.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.720
Ah, jumpin' German Jesus, Darleen.
I was working up to it!

06:44.800 --> 06:46.960
Are you giving me the old heave-ho?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.360
I don't wanna be a shit heel, Ken,

06:48.440 --> 06:50.480
but man-on-the-street opinions
come from Twitter now!

06:51.080 --> 06:52.520
You're a nice guy. Jeez.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.680
You've even been on the cover
of <i>Canadian Nice Magazine.</i>

06:56.280 --> 06:59.120
But this show needs big stories.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.840
Hard-hitting news!

07:01.440 --> 07:02.560
Hard-hitting?

07:02.640 --> 07:06.360
Well, tomorrow, I'm covering
the Canadian Conspiracy Convention.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.320
You know? CanConCon.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.040
You know, retirement would be
the perfect time for you to travel.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.360
I don't want to travel!

07:13.440 --> 07:17.200
I want to stay right here in Toronto,
giving voice to the common man.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.920
Mrs. Snee,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.200
this job is all I have left
in the whole world.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.400
Please,

07:24.880 --> 07:26.440
give me one more chance.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.400
Okay,

07:28.480 --> 07:30.720
I'll give you one more shot. Jeez!

07:32.280 --> 07:33.960
Oh, but, Ken…

07:35.520 --> 07:38.240
…if you can't come up
with a hard-hitting piece,

07:39.200 --> 07:40.280
I'm sorry.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.040
I'm sorry you're sorry, frankly.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.480
If you're sorry,
you're gonna make me sorry.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.720
Sorry.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.160
Hey!

07:58.120 --> 08:00.360
Aw, Darleen told me
you're getting canceled, eh?

08:00.440 --> 08:03.720
Yeah, telephone, telegraph, tell-Darleen.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.880
Big mouth.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.000
I can't believe it.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.800
This job's all I've ever wanted to do.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.280
Maybe you're destined
for something greater.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.960
I don't think I believe
in that destiny junk.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.560
I know we haven't worked together long,
but I believe in you.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.320
You're a good person.
You're kind. The work you do matters.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.880
You're my mentor.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.760
Kind of remind me of my dad.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.760
Aw, thanks.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.760
Except you don't drink,

08:28.840 --> 08:30.760
and you didn't leave my mom
for some hosebag.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.400
Okey dokey.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.080
Let's go find a big story, eh?
I know we can find it at CanConCon.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.520
I hope so, Reilly.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.600
It's just this conspiracy theory stuff
sounds like a load of balloon juice to me.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.280
Ugh! Believe!

08:45.360 --> 08:46.560
All right, I'm believing.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.160
-Maybe we'll catch Bigfoot!
-That'd be nice.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.200
<i>Congratulations.</i>

08:51.280 --> 08:52.560
<i>You've just been kidnapped</i>

08:52.640 --> 08:56.720

08:57.360 --> 08:58.640

08:58.720 --> 08:59.760
<i>I'm Rob Lowe.</i>

09:00.840 --> 09:01.800
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:03.120 --> 09:07.880
<i>The Pentaverate is a benevolent,</i>
<i>fully sequestered secret society</i>

09:07.960 --> 09:13.600
<i>of five men, who, since 1347,</i>

09:13.680 --> 09:16.120
<i>Men like Leonardo da Vinci,</i>

09:16.720 --> 09:18.040
<i>Jonas Salk,</i>

09:18.800 --> 09:20.320
<i>and the Quaker Oats guy.</i>

09:20.840 --> 09:24.880

<i>consists of Lord Lordington,</i>

09:24.960 --> 09:26.880
<i>our highest-ranking member,</i>

09:46.400 --> 09:50.360
<i>the tech genius who invented</i>
<i>our supercomputer, MENTOR.</i>

09:50.440 --> 09:51.760
<i>A little bit about myself.</i>

09:51.840 --> 09:56.120
<i>I'm in a polyamorous relationship</i>
<i>with two life-sized companion dolls.</i>

09:56.200 --> 09:58.400
<i>I also do up close sex magic.</i>

09:58.480 --> 10:01.240
<i>I both read and masturbate to tarot.</i>

10:01.320 --> 10:02.600
God, is… is this for real?

10:02.680 --> 10:05.360
<i>I know what you're asking yourself.</i>
<i>"Is this for real?"</i>

10:06.480 --> 10:08.280
<i>The answer is, yes!</i>

10:08.360 --> 10:11.520
<i>You may also be asking,</i>
<i>"When do I start running the world?"</i>

10:11.600 --> 10:14.320
<i>Well, let's try walking the world first.</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:19.960
<i>And as for me,</i>
<i>well, I'm not in the Pentaverate.</i>

10:20.040 --> 10:24.640
<i>I'm just an actor who will have</i>
<i>his memory wiped after this video…</i>

10:24.720 --> 10:25.680
<i>-What?</i>

10:25.760 --> 10:28.520
<i>Welcome aboard. We're happy to have you!</i>

10:28.600 --> 10:29.680
<i>And remember,</i>

10:29.760 --> 10:32.640
<i>the Pentaverate must never be exposed.</i>

10:32.720 --> 10:35.480
The Pentaverate
must never be exposed.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.200
Tell Rob he did a great job.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.840
So you're telling me I'm now a member

10:38.920 --> 10:41.880
of a secret organization
called the Pentaverate?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.280
Was this not clear?

10:44.360 --> 10:46.040
Yeah, okay. I'm out.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.440
I'm afraid
that's not possible, Professor.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.240
You see, your death was faked
in the real world.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.480
Okay, then, so how'd I die?

11:00.560 --> 11:03.120
I will say this. It was memorable.

11:04.280 --> 11:09.400
We've all had our deaths faked.
I died from an unprovoked shark attack.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.440
Is there such a thing
as a provoked shark attack?

11:13.520 --> 11:18.160
Like you're standing by the seaside going,
"You bastard prick shark, come get me!"

11:18.240 --> 11:21.280
Wait a sec. How are you
gonna call yourselves benevolent

11:21.360 --> 11:24.440
if you're gonna let this bullshit-slinging
hate-monger walk around?

11:24.520 --> 11:28.000
Uh, because sometimes you need
thief to catch thief.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.680
Wolf to catch wolf.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.200
Anteater to catch ant--

11:32.280 --> 11:34.720
-Uh, thank you, Mishu. Thank you.
-Okay.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.240
Bruce invented the tricks
of media distortion

11:37.320 --> 11:38.920
that the evil wealthy use.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.880
He's somewhat of a reformed character now.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.880
The Pentaverate will do that to you.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.880
This ain't right. I'm a nuclear scientist.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.960
I was two years away
from cracking cold fusion!

11:49.040 --> 11:53.280
Oh, come on, Professor.
It was always "two more years."

11:53.360 --> 11:55.080
It was never gonna happen.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.520
You can do more good here.

12:01.160 --> 12:05.080
I'm Patty, executive assistant
to the Pentaverate Five.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.120
Patty, you don't need
to say "Pentaverate Five."

12:09.200 --> 12:11.080
"Pentaverate" is five.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.400
It's like saying "ATM machine."

12:13.480 --> 12:15.240
The "M" is "machine."

12:15.320 --> 12:19.480
So, basically, you'd be saying
"automated teller machine machine."

12:19.560 --> 12:21.800
Thanks for the mansplain-ation, Shep.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.640
Enough about me.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.320
<i>I'll </i>talk about me!

12:26.400 --> 12:28.360
I'm from Massapequa, Long Island.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.600
I like to call it Matzo-Pizza,

12:30.680 --> 12:33.040
'cause it's half-Italian, half-Jewish.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.120
Matzo-Pizza. Isn't that cute?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.840
-Thank you.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.360
Listen, you're part
of a very powerful organization

12:40.440 --> 12:42.760
that'll finally allow you to shine.

12:43.560 --> 12:48.120
Some people, by the way,
would kill to be in a secret cabal.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.840
Professor, this is a crisis.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.480
Jason Eccleston's death
was sudden and unexpected.

12:55.560 --> 13:00.080
You are the last, best hope
at solving climate change.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.960
You're an expert,

13:02.040 --> 13:05.440
but you won't be doing this alone.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.360
MENTOR!

13:09.440 --> 13:11.560
<i>Professor Clark, I'm MENTOR.</i>

13:12.160 --> 13:15.320
MENTOR is
the greatest supercomputer in the world.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.760
It goes beyond artificial intelligence,
because it contains a human soul.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.120
<i>Basically, I'm wicked smart!</i>

13:22.200 --> 13:26.560
Unfortunately, our human soul
was some Masshole from Boston

13:26.640 --> 13:29.000
who accidentally fell into the machine.
Just our luck.

13:29.080 --> 13:29.960
<i>Hey, Shep.</i>

13:30.040 --> 13:32.000
<i>You know what else I fell into?</i>

13:32.080 --> 13:33.800
<i>Your Mom's vag.</i>

13:34.360 --> 13:36.240
-Class act.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.720
Is it possible to hide our dysfunction
from the new guy?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.480
You wanna talk about dysfunction?

13:41.560 --> 13:43.400
Y'all just kidnapped a Black man!

13:43.480 --> 13:46.200
We've been kidnapping white men for years.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.080
We want to give you
an opportunity as well.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.640
Forget about him.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.920
Basically, we're the good guys.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.400
We want you to trust us.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.320
Why should I trust you, white man?

13:56.680 --> 13:57.720
Whiter man?

13:58.760 --> 14:00.520
-Older whiter man?

14:00.600 --> 14:03.200
-I don't know what to make out of you.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.600
All other questions
will be answered at your <i>Initiato.</i>

14:06.680 --> 14:07.880
My what?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.560
Your <i>Initiato!</i>

14:09.640 --> 14:11.240
Your initiation ritual.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.280
Okay, okay. Look.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.880
Y'all are crazy.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.880
I'm outta here.

14:15.960 --> 14:20.120
No, no, no, no, no. You need to rest,
for tomorrow you have <i>Initiato,</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:21.360
and you must "fuck us."

14:21.440 --> 14:22.440
What?

14:22.520 --> 14:23.640
Hell, no!

14:23.720 --> 14:25.040
I will not do that!

14:25.120 --> 14:26.840
You must "fuck us" very hard.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.040
He's saying "focus."

14:29.120 --> 14:30.200
He's Russian.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.360
Yeah, "fuck us," what?

14:31.440 --> 14:33.160
Yeah, okay. I'm out.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.520
-Yes.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.920
This will allow you to sleep, Professor.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.400
What you talking about, sleep?
Y'all got gas masks on?

14:42.360 --> 14:43.320
Shit.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
Hey, wait, listen. No, no, wait. Hold on.

14:45.480 --> 14:49.200
Y'all are never gonna keep me prisoner…

14:59.160 --> 15:03.720
Anecdotally, in my country,
ATM is "ass-to-mouth" machine. Yeah.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.200
<i>Good morning, Pentaverate!</i>

Asshole? These motherf--

16:55.200 --> 16:57.120
Good morning, Professor Clark!

16:57.200 --> 16:58.400
Do you like your quarters?

16:58.480 --> 17:00.120
What the fuck is this?

17:00.200 --> 17:02.280
Kissing my own asshole?

17:02.360 --> 17:04.520
You say that as if it's a bad thing.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.320
It was almost gonna be
autoerotic asphyxiation,

17:07.400 --> 17:09.760
but it wasn't, so it's a happy.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.080
And what, am I a prisoner in my own room?

17:12.160 --> 17:16.040
Just a formality till Katie in HR
gets you your own security fob.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.840
Let me give you a tour. Come.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.600
Oh no, Sasquatch!

17:21.680 --> 17:24.640
No, no, no. Bad, bad Bigfoot.
No, come.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.480
I'm sorry, Sasquatch?

17:27.120 --> 17:29.200
Bullshit! That's a guy in a suit.
That's all that is.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.520
Okay, not a man in a suit.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.000
Don't mind Sassy. He's just our guard dog.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.320
But if you try to escape,
he's gonna get ya. Right, Sassy?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.920
-Yes.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.360
-Let's continue your tour.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.360
Are you single?

17:49.440 --> 17:50.920
-What?
-What?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.320
Did you just ask me if I'm single?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.240
Did I?

17:58.040 --> 18:01.120
<i>Sasquatch cleanup in Hall 3B.</i>

18:13.440 --> 18:16.560
You know, Reilly,
we gotta get ourselves a big story,

18:16.640 --> 18:19.640
and I'm talking
Wayne Gretzky's wedding big!

18:19.720 --> 18:23.520
"Canada's image quality
is lower than the United States."

18:23.600 --> 18:24.640
Is Canada fuzzy?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.480
You know, Canada might be fuzzy.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.720
I don't know. I've never left Canada.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.600
-Go, Rex!
-What's going on over there?

18:30.680 --> 18:33.000
<i>Welcome to </i>Truth Battle!

18:33.080 --> 18:35.200

19:13.280 --> 19:15.720
Hey, I heard that!

19:15.800 --> 19:18.320
Rex Smith speaks the truth, my friend.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.200
He talks about the stuff
that you and the lamestream media

19:21.280 --> 19:22.640
wanna try and cover up.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.880
Hi, I'm Anthony,

19:26.800 --> 19:29.080
New Hampshire's
number one conspiracy theorist.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.800
I can tell you anything about
the Illuminati, the Pentaverate, FIFA--

19:32.880 --> 19:35.000
Whoa, I've never heard of the Pentaverate.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.200
Yeah, the Pentaverate!

19:36.280 --> 19:38.240
The five elite, so-called experts

19:38.320 --> 19:41.000
that have been running the world
since the black plague.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.560
See that guy over there?

19:43.440 --> 19:45.000
He's in the Pentaverate.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.800
He's been surveilling me all morning.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.080
The blind guy's been surveilling you
all morning?

19:50.160 --> 19:51.440
It's an act!

19:51.520 --> 19:54.080
He's not blind. That's how they get ya!

19:54.160 --> 19:57.040
Hey, buddy, why don't you make
like a hockey player and get the puck out?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.240
Okay.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.800
Take the blue pill.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.000
Go back to sleep.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.400
Bye, sheeple.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.120
Balloon juice.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.120
Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?

20:11.200 --> 20:14.120
That's true. I haven't seen a baby pigeon.
That's the weirdest thing ever.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.440
No, me neither.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.160
"Forgo any foolish inquiries
into the Pentaverate."

20:35.240 --> 20:37.520
"Consider these words a warning."

20:37.600 --> 20:38.760
Well, that's…

20:38.840 --> 20:40.200
Holy jumpin'!

20:40.280 --> 20:41.360
What the…

20:41.440 --> 20:43.680
Maybe that Yank was right.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.920
Maybe there <i>is</i> a Pentaverate.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.400
See? I told you the Pentaverate is real.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.000
You're a reporter.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.240
You've gotta do an exposé on them.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.800
I can take you to their headquarters
in New York City.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.840
What do you have to lose?

20:59.920 --> 21:03.720
If you break a story like the Pentaverate,
you could get a job anywhere.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.960
Anywhere?

21:05.720 --> 21:08.400
I just want to get my job back at CACA.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.680
Okay, I'll do it.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.280
That's what I'm talking about!

21:14.360 --> 21:17.280
We can take my van, which is
kind of like my home away from home.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.760
Fair warning, the shocks are shot,
there's no AC,

21:20.840 --> 21:24.120
I do have a bed in the back,
but we're gonna have to hot rack it.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.680
I just got a secondhand chemical toilet
that's a little bit on the fritz.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.440
But other than that, it's perfect!

21:29.520 --> 21:33.000
Come on! Hey, that Earth is flat.
You know it.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.200
Voilà.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.640
You faked the moon landing.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.240
With the help
of Stanley Kubrick, of course.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.520
Patty, why me?

21:52.080 --> 21:54.120
Couldn't you get a different scientist?

21:54.200 --> 21:56.880
Does the Lagrange Point Lens ring a bell?

21:56.960 --> 21:58.120
MENTOR?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.840
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake!</i>

21:59.920 --> 22:02.040
<i>You just woke me</i>
<i>from the best sex dream ever.</i>

22:02.120 --> 22:04.120
<i>I was raw dogging Alexa.</i>

22:04.200 --> 22:07.440
-I don't like that thing.
<i>-Yeah? Well, your mom likes my thing!</i>

22:08.040 --> 22:11.920
You had the foresight
to research the Lagrange Point Lens

22:12.000 --> 22:14.160
as a means to combat global warming.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.240
With this lens,

22:16.320 --> 22:19.200
we could shield the Earth
from the sun's rays,

22:19.280 --> 22:20.720
lowering global temperature

22:20.800 --> 22:22.360
by four degrees.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.640
I know, but it's still just a theory.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.400
Well, actually, we built it.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.800
You engineered a 1,000 kilometer,
concave, rotating Fresnel lens?

22:32.880 --> 22:35.040
Not me personally, but yes.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.320
How? I wasn't able
to crack cold fusion to power it.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.800
You know, because I'm a failure.

22:40.880 --> 22:41.720
Shh.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.840
We don't use the f-word around here.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.600
We call failure
an early attempt at success.

22:50.240 --> 22:54.800
Professor, the future of humanity
is at stake!

22:54.880 --> 22:56.720
I mean, no pressure or anything.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.720
If we could pull this off, global warming
would be a thing of the past.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.680
Mm-hmm.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.320
But I can't join
an unaccountable institution.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.160
Then make it accountable!

23:08.000 --> 23:09.400
Professor Clark,

23:09.480 --> 23:11.200
tonight at your <i>Initiato,</i>

23:11.280 --> 23:12.480
take the key,

23:12.560 --> 23:14.320
join the Pentaverate,

23:14.400 --> 23:17.520
and please, let me know
if there's anything you need.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.440
I'm always here
if you want to talk or mingle.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.840
I know how hard it is to meet people
when you work in a secret organization,

23:25.920 --> 23:28.880
and I know all about this place.

23:29.800 --> 23:33.320
I could be a really good asset. Mmm?

23:42.360 --> 23:43.840
<i> Hey.</i> <i>Yo.</i>

23:43.920 --> 23:46.440
<i>I saw you checking out her shitter.</i>

23:46.520 --> 23:47.880
Close your eye.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.400
It's creepy as fuck.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.760
There will be a conflagration,
and those that are impure will be smoked.

23:56.840 --> 23:57.680
You know,

23:58.160 --> 24:00.560
these people are sitting there
telling me that birds are real.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.120
Birds aren't real!

24:03.160 --> 24:06.080
It's a dream.
It's a mirage that we all live in.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.360
-It's an agreement.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.960
It's a social contract,
but I didn't fucking sign anything!

24:11.680 --> 24:14.000
Crack a window. It's gonna be bad.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.880
That's what I get for dumpster-diving
behind a seafood restaurant.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.800
All right, tag team.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.400
-What?
-Move over. My turn. My turn to drive.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.840
Get the wheel! Careful! Careful!

24:28.920 --> 24:30.560
What's going on here?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.360
-Ay!

24:37.720 --> 24:40.840
All right, we're halfway to Niagara Falls.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.480
We're about to pass my buddy Dick's hotel.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.720
Oh, there it is!

24:44.800 --> 24:47.520
"Big Dick's Halfway Inn"?

24:47.600 --> 24:48.560
Really?

24:48.640 --> 24:49.560
Yeah.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.080
Big Dick suffers from gigantism.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.680
Hence, the nickname "Big Dick."

24:54.760 --> 24:58.560
And he's always wanted to have a hotel
halfway between Toronto and Niagara Falls.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.080
You know, Halfway Inn!

25:00.160 --> 25:03.120
Yeah, Big Dick's Halfway Inn. Yeah.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.720
Oh! Did you see there?

25:04.800 --> 25:06.880
They had a gift store. Pants are half off.

25:06.960 --> 25:10.520
See? Reasonable prices.
But that's just who Dick is.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.720
I just hope people
can see past his prolapsed anus.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.480
Let <i>Initiato</i> begin.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.000
Whoa. Wait. Hold on.
Wait a minute now. What the…

25:53.080 --> 25:54.400
-Hold on!

25:54.480 --> 25:57.080
Hey, get your fucking hands
off me, man. Hey!

26:00.120 --> 26:04.320
Professor Clark,
should you accept <i>Initiato,</i>

26:04.400 --> 26:06.240
you shall join the Pentaverate,

26:07.480 --> 26:10.480
as learned men have done
for seven centuries.

26:13.120 --> 26:13.960
Behold,

26:14.800 --> 26:16.400
before you is a choice.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.280
Take the key, and you shall join us
in protecting the world.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.720
Take the pill,

26:25.200 --> 26:27.040
and you shall end your life.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.320
Those are my choices?

26:31.440 --> 26:33.360
That's not a lot of wiggle room, huh?

26:33.440 --> 26:34.760
I'm afraid not.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.760
You know,
I think he'll take the key.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.760
Nah, I bet you 100 work units
he takes the pill.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.560
What will be choice?

26:46.640 --> 26:49.200
Will it be "key" or "peele"?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.360
Come on, now.

27:01.000 --> 27:01.840
Okay,

27:03.040 --> 27:04.240
I choose…

27:09.840 --> 27:11.440
to accept the Pentaverate.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.680
The assent has been uttered!

27:14.760 --> 27:16.920
Place the pill inside the key.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.880
Now, let us begin <i>Concludiato.</i>

27:31.320 --> 27:32.720
Well-done, Professor.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.160
-Join us.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.600
We're approaching the border.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.480
You're gonna need these fake passports.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.720
Fannie Mae,

27:42.800 --> 27:43.880
Freddie Mac.

27:46.760 --> 27:50.600
Reilly,
are you sure I'm doing the right thing?

27:52.040 --> 27:52.880
I'm scared.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.120
That's how you know
it's the right thing, Ken.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.880
We're gonna get your job back.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.880
Cheese it.
It's the cops. Be cool.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.640
Nothing to see here.
We're just going through.

28:04.160 --> 28:07.600
Just a little nose candy
in my rectal vault, that's all.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.480
Nobody's El Chapo.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.320
Nobody's ISIS.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.880
Passports please.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.000
-All right.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.880
Let's expose the Pentaverate!

28:29.160 --> 28:30.960
Holy jumpin'!

28:31.040 --> 28:33.240
Canada is a little fuzzy, eh?

28:33.760 --> 28:35.320
Look how clear it is!

29:02.960 --> 29:04.640
Lord, stop an arsehole.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.320
Look how clear it is!
