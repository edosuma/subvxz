WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:04.700
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON. HITTING HER?

00:04.700 --> 00:06.528
YOU THINK HE
ACTUALLY HITS HER?

00:06.528 --> 00:07.877
JUST LOOK AT WHAT'S
BEEN HAPPENING
WITH HER, MAN.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.139
BECAUSE, MAN,
IF THAT'S TRUE...

00:09.139 --> 00:10.619
GRIFFIN, WE'VE
BEEN OVER THIS.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.882
SHE COMES HOME FROM SCHOOL
ACTING LIKE THEY BROKE UP.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.666
I MEAN,
AND HER ARM'S HURT.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.494
SHE MAKES UP
SOME BOGUS STORY

00:16.494 --> 00:17.626
ABOUT BEING
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.280
LISTEN, I'VE WATCHED THEM,

00:19.280 --> 00:21.412
AND THERE'S NO SIGN
OF ANYTHING--

00:21.412 --> 00:22.370
WHAT BOGUS STORY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS BOGUS?

00:22.370 --> 00:23.675
I WENT OUT TO LOOK
AT THE CAR.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.850
THERE'S NO DENT
WHERE SHE SAID
SHE GOT HIT.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.244
I'VE WATCHED THEM--
A LOT--

00:27.244 --> 00:29.290
AND ALL I SEE IS,
IS THEY'RE...

00:29.290 --> 00:30.900
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.294
AND MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU,

00:33.294 --> 00:36.036
WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
TO SIGN YOUR DIVORCE PAPERS.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.994
THEY ARE? YOU ARE?

00:37.994 --> 00:40.170
YOU THINK
I LIKE THIS,
CHARLIE? HUH?

00:40.170 --> 00:41.824
YOU THINK IT'S FUN
FOR ME TO LOOK
AT YOU GUYS

00:41.824 --> 00:43.521
AND SEE THAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

00:43.521 --> 00:44.783
"POOR STUPID
GRIFFIN.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.655
CAN'T GET OVER
JULIA."

00:46.655 --> 00:47.699
HEY, MAN.
NOBODY'S SAYING...

00:50.311 --> 00:51.964
I MEAN, WHAT IF
IT'S POSSIBLE?

00:51.964 --> 00:54.054
REALLY, LET'S JUST
FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.577
BECAUSE IF IT'S
AT ALL POSSIBLE--

00:55.577 --> 00:57.405
BAILEY, IT'S NOT.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.016
COME ON. SHE'S, LIKE,
THE STRONGEST ONE
OF ALL OF US

01:00.016 --> 01:02.105
AND THE SMARTEST.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.541
THE IDEA THAT SHE WOULD
LET SOMEONE HIT HER--

01:03.541 --> 01:06.283
Sarah: IT COULD HAPPEN.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.459
IT COULD.

01:08.459 --> 01:09.852
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:09.852 --> 01:14.074
THERE'S THIS WOMAN
IN MY VICTIMS GROUP,

01:14.074 --> 01:17.077
YOU KNOW, WHO I THOUGHT
WAS A COUNSELOR.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.904
SHE WAS ALWAYS
ON HER CELL PHONE

01:18.904 --> 01:21.255
AND TELLING EVERYBODY ELSE
WHAT THEIR PROBLEM WAS.

01:21.255 --> 01:24.649
BUT DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHY SHE WAS THERE?

01:24.649 --> 01:27.522
SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE
HER SECRETARY--

01:27.522 --> 01:30.307
THIS GUY THAT SHE WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH--

01:30.307 --> 01:32.048
WAS BEATING HER.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.571
BEATING HER SO BADLY

01:33.571 --> 01:35.660
THAT SHE HAD TO MISS GIVING
HER ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

01:35.660 --> 01:37.488
FOR BEING HEAD
OF HER SALES DIVISION.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.708
THE BRUISES, SHE, UM...

01:39.708 --> 01:42.493
SHE COULDN'T
COVER THEM UP ANYMORE.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.756
NO AMOUNT OF MAKEUP
WOULD DO IT.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.023
I'M GONNA
TALK TO HER.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.678
BAILEY.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.679
NO. SHE CAN HATE ME
IF SHE WANTS TO,

01:54.679 --> 01:56.899
BUT I'M GONNA ASK HER.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.248
SHE'LL PROBABLY SAY NO.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.902
OK. YOU'LL SEE,
RIGHT?

01:59.902 --> 02:02.122
JUST TALK TO HER.
YOU'LL SEE.

AND COCA-COLA CLASSIC

02:42.292 --> 02:43.293
GUESS WHO.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.294

02:44.294 --> 02:46.296
OK. NOT WHO. WHAT.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.689
MY VERY TARDY
BOYFRIEND?

02:47.689 --> 02:49.299
OK. NOT WHAT. WHY.

02:49.299 --> 02:52.084
A VERY GOOD REASON,
I HOPE,

02:52.084 --> 02:53.956
FOR LEAVING ME
ALONE AND BORED
FOR HALF THE MORNING.

02:53.956 --> 02:57.177
SORRY. CORRECT ANSWER
WAS VALENTINE'S DAY,
STUPID.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.830
NOT FOR 48 HOURS.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.616
WHO YOU CALLING STUPID,
STUPID?

03:01.616 --> 03:03.879
SEE, BUT THAT'S
A NORMAL PERSON'S
VALENTINE'S.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.663
YOU, YOU GET
MORE THAN THAT.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.709
YOU GET THE VALENTINE'S
WEEKEND

03:07.709 --> 03:11.756
WITH A SPECIAL
OPENING CEREMONY
SO BREATHTAKING

03:11.756 --> 03:14.455
YOU NEED
TO BE BLINDFOLDED
TO GET THE FULL EFFECT.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.065
NED.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.285
NO HANKY,
NO SURPRISE.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.722
YOUR CHOICE.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.028
OK, BUT NOT TOO TIGHT,

03:23.028 --> 03:24.421
AND DON'T TAKE ME THROUGH
THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.075
I WORK WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.076
OK.

03:27.076 --> 03:27.990
COME ON.

03:29.818 --> 03:33.474
SO ALL OF THEIR
CALIFORNIA LOCATIONS.

03:33.474 --> 03:36.346
THAT'S GOTTA BE--
HOW MANY HOTELS
IS THAT?

03:36.346 --> 03:39.480
7. AND THEY WANT
A RESTAURANT
IN EVERY ONE.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.829
THAT'S...

03:40.829 --> 03:42.439
THAT COULD BE HUGE.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.354
WELL, IT'S JUST A BID.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.487
THEY'RE ASKING ME
TO MAKE A BID
FOR THE BUSINESS.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.664
AND YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME BECAUSE...

03:49.664 --> 03:51.666
WELL, I NEED A PACKAGE--

03:51.666 --> 03:53.972
NOT JUST NUMBERS,
BUT FACES.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.800
SUCCESSFUL FACES.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.195
AND I THINK, THEY MEET YOU,
THEY FEEL YOUR PASSION,

03:59.195 --> 04:01.197
THEY SEE HOW YOUNG
YOU ARE.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.938
BEING 20,
THAT'S A GOOD THING?

04:02.938 --> 04:04.983
YOUNG IS HOT.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.944
BAILEY, THIS IS THE CHANCE
OF A LIFETIME HERE.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.294
NO. I KNOW.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.513
IT'S JUST...

04:12.513 --> 04:14.384
YOU AND I HAVEN'T
ALWAYS SEEN

04:14.384 --> 04:16.299
EYE-TO-EYE
ON EVERYTHING.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.258
I'M NOT HANDING YOU
SOMETHING ON A PLATTER.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.825
THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH
AND RISKY.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.436
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

04:22.436 --> 04:24.655
I'VE SEEN
HOW HARD YOU WORK,

04:24.655 --> 04:26.701
AND I THINK MAYBE
A PIECE OF THIS

04:26.701 --> 04:28.355
IS WORTH A PIECE OF THAT.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.796
Dr. Baring:
POLICE REPORTS,

04:34.796 --> 04:36.580
DOCTORS' FILES,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.800
TEXAS
SOCIAL SERVICES.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.280
IS THERE ANY
OVERVIEW IN HERE?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.325
UH...NO.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.848
NOT REALLY.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.895
I GUESS I SHOULD, UH...

04:46.895 --> 04:50.464
UM, BASICALLY...

04:50.464 --> 04:55.120
DAPHNE'S MOTHER LOCKED HER
IN THE BASEMENT
AND DISAPPEARED.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.297
LEFT HER THERE WITH NO
FOOD OR WATER

04:57.297 --> 04:59.995
AND JUST...TOOK OFF
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

04:59.995 --> 05:03.041
AND, UM, THE NEIGHBORS
STARTED TO WORRY

05:03.041 --> 05:04.782
BECAUSE THE LIGHTS
HAD BEEN LEFT ON

05:04.782 --> 05:08.177
AND DAPHNE'S MOM HAD
LEFT HER ALONE BEFORE.

05:08.177 --> 05:13.617
SO AFTER 3 OR 4 DAYS,
SOMEONE BROKE A WINDOW.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.619
IT'S ALL THERE
IN THE POLICE REPORT.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.492
WHO'D SHE STAY WITH
AFTER?

05:18.492 --> 05:21.190
COUSINS, GRANDMOTHER,
ALL DIFFERENT FAMILY.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.931
18 MONTHS.
THEN HER MOM CAME BACK.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.585
THERE WERE SOME HEARINGS,

05:24.585 --> 05:26.848
SOME COURT-ORDERED
PARENTING CLASSES,

05:26.848 --> 05:31.026
AND THEN SHE GOT
DAPHNE BACK.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.465
SO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

05:35.465 --> 05:36.640
I MEAN, DOES IT MAKE
SENSE TO YOU

05:36.640 --> 05:38.425
THAT SHE'D BE THE KIND
OF PERSON THAT...

05:38.425 --> 05:39.687
THAT WOULDN'T WANT KIDS?

05:42.254 --> 05:44.692
WELL, FROM WHAT
YOU'VE JUST SAID,

05:44.692 --> 05:46.520
A GIRL LIKE DAPHNE--
3 YEARS OLD,

05:46.520 --> 05:49.871
HER MOTHER LEAVES HER,
LEAVES HER LIKE THIS--

05:49.871 --> 05:52.743
I'D BE AMAZED
IF SHE TRUSTED ANY
EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT,

05:52.743 --> 05:53.788
NEVER MIND WITH A BABY.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.616
REALLY?

05:55.616 --> 05:58.749
WE CALL IT PRIMARY
ATTACHMENT AVERSION.

05:58.749 --> 06:02.840
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL,
SHE'S A CLASSIC CASE.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.754
REALLY.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.806
ANTHRO 12. OK.
YOU WERE SAYING?

06:11.806 --> 06:13.198
IT'S A LONG SHOT,
FOR SURE,

06:13.198 --> 06:14.809
LIKE ANY NEW BUSINESS IS,

06:14.809 --> 06:16.593
BUT YOU CAN'T BEAT
THE LOCATION.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.290
WE'D BE PARTNERED
WITH THESE HUGE HOTELS--

06:18.290 --> 06:20.510
REALLY DEEP POCKETS
AND A CAPTIVE CLIENTELE.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.599
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S...

06:22.599 --> 06:24.209
NOTES FOR MY TAKE-HOME.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

06:24.209 --> 06:27.256
YEAH, SO DEFINITELY,
LET'S CELEBRATE.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.084
I MEAN, LET'S NUKE UP
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.738
WELL, TONIGHT I CAN'T

06:30.738 --> 06:32.870
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO
SEE JULIA WITH CHARLIE.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.524
RIGHT, RIGHT.
OF COURSE.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.005
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE
HAVING LUNCH INSTEAD.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.487
LUNCH. I CAN'T.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.966
I CAN'T.
I'VE GOT, UM...

06:41.966 --> 06:43.620
MEDIEVAL CIV, I KNOW.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.665
WHICH IS WHY I'M GONNA
DRIVE YOU TO CLASS,

06:44.665 --> 06:46.231
SO I CAN DRIVE YOU BACK.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.885
SO WE CAN HAVE
A RIDICULOUSLY
EXTRAVAGANT,

06:47.885 --> 06:49.321
EXPENSIVE LUNCH
AT LE CHEVRE

06:49.321 --> 06:52.412
WHERE I'VE ALREADY
MADE RESERVATIONS.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.630
REALLY?

06:53.630 --> 06:54.936
REALLY.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.112
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S--NO.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.940
NO.
NO?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.420
I FORGOT.
CHARLIE CALLED,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.247
AND HE'S GOT A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT
OR SOMETHING.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.684
YOU HAVE
TO PICK UP OWEN.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.207
NOW? I DO?

07:07.644 --> 07:10.821
WELL, WHO AM I GONNA
CELEBRATE WITH?

07:10.821 --> 07:13.694
SIT UP STRAIGHT, O.
YOU'RE IN A NICE
PLACE HERE.

07:13.694 --> 07:16.174
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE,
BAILEY?

07:16.174 --> 07:18.089
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
PRACTICING MY DRIBBLE.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.178
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
COACHING ME.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.571
IT'S A SPECIAL
OCCASION, O.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.356
WELL, WHY AREN'T WE
AT SALINGER'S THEN?

07:24.356 --> 07:25.967
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
A SPECIAL OCCASION
IF I HAVE TO WORK.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.622
SO HAVE SOME MORE...
HAVE SOME MORE CAVIAR.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.493
IT TASTES LIKE
MUSHED-UP SEAWEED.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.886
NO, IT DOESN'T.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.454
I'VE HAD MUSHED-UP
SEAWEED, BAILEY.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.194
IT TASTES
JUST LIKE THIS.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.979
OK. HERE.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.242
JUST LET ME TELL YOU

07:40.242 --> 07:42.418
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT
THIS OCCASION, OK?

07:44.725 --> 07:47.467
OUR FAMILY
HAS A TRADITION

07:47.467 --> 07:49.381
OF BEING IN
THE FOOD BUSINESS,

07:49.381 --> 07:51.383
AND YOUR BIG BROTHER
IS ABOUT--

07:51.383 --> 07:53.385
MUSHROOMS! GROSS.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.952
I'M GONNA GAG.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
PSYCH ME, CODY.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.393
I NEED PSYCH.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.612
OK.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.963
THE CROWD IS HUSHED
AS MASTER BOWLER STU

08:05.963 --> 08:10.228
PREPARES TO THROW
HIS PATENTED
DESTRUCTO-MAMA.

08:10.228 --> 08:13.231
ADORING WOMEN OF ALL
SHAPES AND SIZES

08:13.231 --> 08:15.103
COME FROM EVERY CORNER

08:15.103 --> 08:16.757
TO SEE THE WONDER BOY
BOWL.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.460
OH, YEAH.
YES!

08:24.460 --> 08:26.462
TOLD YA.
ALL I NEEDED
WAS PSYCH, BABY.

08:28.769 --> 08:29.987
CLAUDIA, YOU'RE UP.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.424
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.035
NOT PLAYING.

08:34.035 --> 08:34.818
COME ON, YOU'RE
ON RAFF'S TEAM.

08:34.818 --> 08:35.863
HE ALREADY WENT.
YOU'RE UP.

08:37.647 --> 08:38.822
CAN I TALK TO YOU
A SECOND?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.046
I CAN'T BOWL.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.656
I TOLD YOU THAT,
LIKE, 6 OR 7 TIMES.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.049
EVERYONE SAYS THAT,

08:48.049 --> 08:50.051
BUT THEY LOVE IT
WHEN THEY TRY.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.879
CODY, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE A DATE.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.402
AND I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,

08:53.402 --> 08:54.925
BUT MY IDEA OF A DATE
IS WHEN 2 PEOPLE GO OUT

08:54.925 --> 08:57.188
AND DO SOMETHING
THAT BOTH OF THEM
WANT TO DO.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.060
STU AND RAFF ARE
MY BUDS, YOU KNOW.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.844
I ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD TIME
WHEN I'M WITH THEM,

09:00.844 --> 09:02.672
SO I THOUGHT,
IF THEY COME ALONG,

09:02.672 --> 09:04.805
YOU'D HAVE A GOOD TIME.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.371
COME ON, BRO.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.547
IS SHE GOIN' OR NOT?

09:10.506 --> 09:11.942
GUESS NOT, HUH?

09:19.994 --> 09:21.996
I JUST FEEL SO BAD.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.781
OK. BUT,
CHARLIE, WHY?

09:24.781 --> 09:26.174
I MEAN, IF IT'S
LIKE YOU SAID,

09:26.174 --> 09:27.523
IF IT LETS HER
OFF THE HOOK...

09:27.523 --> 09:30.178
THE STUFF I SAID TO HER.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.920
I MEAN, HERE SHE WAS
HATING BEING A MOTHER

09:32.920 --> 09:35.183
AND HATING HERSELF
FOR FEELING THAT WAY,

09:35.183 --> 09:37.402
AND ALL I COULD DO
WAS PUSH HER.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.187
CHARLIE--

09:39.187 --> 09:40.797
AND ALL THIS TIME

09:40.797 --> 09:41.929
THERE WAS STUFF
TO EXPLAIN IT,

09:41.929 --> 09:44.453
STUFF THAT COULD HELP HER.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.760
HELP HER?

09:46.760 --> 09:48.631
IF SHE SAW WHAT WAS
IN THAT FILE,

09:48.631 --> 09:50.459
IF SHE KNEW THE STUFF
THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER.

09:50.459 --> 09:54.028
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS
IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA?

09:54.028 --> 09:56.552
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD DO?

09:56.552 --> 09:57.597
I DON'T KNOW.

09:59.903 --> 10:03.428
I MEAN, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
SHE JUST WASN'T CUT OUT
TO BE A MOTHER.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.995
SHE WAS MISSING A GENE
OR SOMETHING.

10:04.995 --> 10:08.259
BUT--BUT NOW I CAN SEE
THAT THIS...

10:08.259 --> 10:10.087
THE TROUBLE SHE HAD,
IT WASN'T HER.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.307
IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED TO HER.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.265
AND MAYBE SHE'D START
TO SEE IT THAT WAY, TOO.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.615
MAYBE SHE'D START
TO FEEL OK ABOUT--

10:15.615 --> 10:18.182
ABOUT STUFF THAT
FELT WRONG BEFORE.

10:18.182 --> 10:21.055
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE--LIKE...

10:21.055 --> 10:22.796
ABOUT BEING
WITH DIANA?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.188
LIKE BEING WITH DIANA.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.886
LIKE BEING HERE.

10:25.886 --> 10:29.672
ALL OF IT. YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE COULD...

10:29.672 --> 10:31.239
MAYBE WE COULD
BE A FAMILY AGAIN.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.721
HEY.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.940
HEY, KIDDO.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.028
HI.

10:39.247 --> 10:42.206
SO, IS IT TIME?

10:42.206 --> 10:43.381
IT'S TIME.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.166
I GOTTA...

10:45.166 --> 10:48.517
I'LL, UH, SEE YOU LATER.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.127
BYE.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.833
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.618
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.663
JULES.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.055
JULIA, WE DON'T.
OK? WE DON'T.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.709
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE
THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE,

11:06.709 --> 11:07.754
BECAUSE YOU
CAME OVER HERE
TO TALK TO ME.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.670
GRIFFIN WAS JUST...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.846
HE WAS REALLY
SURE ABOUT IT.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.456
GRIFFIN IS JEALOUS.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.110
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

11:16.110 --> 11:18.547
DON'T YOU SEE THAT'S WHY
HE WOULD DO THIS?

11:18.547 --> 11:20.331
YES, WE DO, BUT--

11:20.331 --> 11:21.724
NO. DON'T BLAME GRIFFIN
FOR THIS,

11:21.724 --> 11:23.160
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONES
STANDING HERE.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.075
YOU'RE THE ONES ASKING ME
IF MY BOYFRIEND BEATS ME,

11:25.075 --> 11:27.251
AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO ANSWER THAT, HUH?

11:27.251 --> 11:29.906
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CONVINCE YOU
THAT HE ISN'T?

11:29.906 --> 11:32.648
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING THAT WE
DO TOGETHER?

11:32.648 --> 11:34.302
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT WE SAY WHEN WE FIGHT?

11:34.302 --> 11:35.956
'CAUSE WE DO FIGHT,
IF THAT'S OK.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.784
JULIE, NOBODY'S
ASKING--

11:37.784 --> 11:39.133
OR IS THAT NOT ENOUGH?
YOU WANNA KNOW
HOW WE MAKE UP?

11:39.133 --> 11:40.221
YOU WANNA KNOW
ABOUT THE SEX?

11:40.221 --> 11:41.178
JULIA, THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.878
OK? THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.061
THIS JUST REALLY HURTS.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.540
YOU KNOW?

11:55.540 --> 11:58.413
'CAUSE WHILE YOU GUYS
ARE HAVING BABIES

11:58.413 --> 11:59.588
AND MANAGING
RESTAURANTS,

11:59.588 --> 12:05.028
NED IS THERE FOR ME
EVERY SECOND--

12:05.028 --> 12:07.248
WORRYING ABOUT ME
AND TAKING CARE OF ME

12:07.248 --> 12:08.597
LIKE NO ONE HAS SINCE...

12:08.597 --> 12:11.513
GOD, SINCE MOM AND DAD.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.607
SO MAYBE INSTEAD
OF INSULTING NED,

12:18.607 --> 12:20.740
YOU SHOULD BE
SAYING THANKS.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.360
NO, I--

12:32.360 --> 12:34.014
NONE OF IT.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.103
I DON'T WANT
HIS MONEY, MARTHA.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.888
IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF DIVORCE.
THAT'S NOT WHY I HIRED YOU.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.240
LOOK, IF IT'S YOUR FEE
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT,

12:43.240 --> 12:46.678
I HAVE OTHER EXPENSES
TO TAKE CARE OF FIRST--

12:46.678 --> 12:48.332
JUST, YOU KNOW,
MOVING EXPENSES, BUT--

12:51.074 --> 12:55.078
WELL, I'LL GET A JOB.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.777
I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT IT THROUGH YET,

12:57.777 --> 13:01.302
BUT OBVIOUSLY I HAVE TO.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.478
I'M ON MY OWN NOW, SO..

13:03.478 --> 13:05.088
SO I'LL...

13:05.088 --> 13:07.047
I'LL DO WHAT
I HAVE TO DO.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.095
OK, CAN WE JUST...

13:12.095 --> 13:13.967
CAN WE JUST
GET THIS PART DONE?

13:15.533 --> 13:16.447
OK.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.276
OK.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.891
CHARLIE?

13:26.457 --> 13:28.677
WHERE ARE YOU?

13:28.677 --> 13:29.852
CHARLIE?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.116
I WAS JUST--

13:33.116 --> 13:34.422
I NEED--
I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.945
I'M GOING TO NEED TO FIND
A JOB IN A HURRY, AND--

13:35.945 --> 13:37.512
I'M GOING TO GO
SEE HER, KIRSTEN.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.079
WHAT?

13:39.079 --> 13:41.168
I'M GOING
TO GO SEE HER.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.126
I MEAN...

13:43.126 --> 13:46.129
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO,
YOU KNOW?

13:46.129 --> 13:47.435
SHE WON'T RETURN
MY PHONE CALLS.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.177
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN TALK TO HER.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.395
AND I CAN'T JUST
MAIL IT TO HER.
NO WAY.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.702
UNLESS YOU GIVE IT
TO ONE OF HER FRIENDS.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.225
NO, NO.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.010
NO. I HAVE TO BE THERE
WHEN SHE SEES IT.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.446
I GOTTA TELL HER
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.795
I MEAN, THIS IS...

13:59.795 --> 14:00.883
THIS IS WAY TOO INTENSE.

14:03.059 --> 14:06.323
OK. IF--IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.548
OK. BRING IT BACK NOW.
LET'S GO.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.332
HE'S OPEN.
HE'S OPEN.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.943
Sean: THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE AN OPENING.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.161
THEY'RE ALL SOFTENED UP
FOR OUR PITCH.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.815
NOW IF WE--

14:19.815 --> 14:21.643
WAS THIS THE ONLY PLACE
WE COULD MEET, OR WHAT?

14:21.643 --> 14:23.123
I'M SORRY.
LET ME JUST--

14:23.123 --> 14:24.211
HEY, GUYS.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.212
OK. BALL.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.822
GUYS, GUYS,
GUYS, GUYS.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.215
HEY, HEY, HEY. GUYS.

14:28.215 --> 14:32.001
DON'T JUST
HOG THE BALL, OK?

14:32.001 --> 14:33.829
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA
LOOK FOR THE OPEN MAN.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.918
WELL, WE'RE ACTUALLY
WORKING ON SHOOTING.

14:35.918 --> 14:36.919
YEAH, BUT IF THEY'RE
5 FEET OUT,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.312
THEY CAN'T EVEN
REACH THE HOOP.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.357
HEY, BAILEY. I GOT
RUTLEDGE ON THE LINE.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.142
HE WANTS TO HEAR
ABOUT OUR FLOOR PLAN.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.273
OK.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.405
YOU GUYS ARE ON
A TEAM HERE.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.450
OK? SO DON'T TRY
AND PLAY EVERY POSITION.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.584
IF EVERYBODY'S ON YOU,
LOOK TO PASS SOMETIMES, OK?

14:49.584 --> 14:50.541
GOOD. THANK YOU,
BAILEY.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.803
GOOD IDEA.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.936
PASSING DRILL, GUYS.
2 LINES, SINGLE FILE.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.198
HELLO.

14:55.198 --> 14:58.245
RIGHT. OK. I'LL
DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.291
YOU WALK INTO
A VESTIBULE.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.774
NO, NO. THE KITCHEN'S
ACROSS FROM THE BAR.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.601
IF YOU TRY
AND PICTURE--

15:08.516 --> 15:10.735
JERRY, YEAH,
HANG ON A SECOND.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.173
LOOK, WE CAN'T DO THIS
OVER THE PHONE.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.783
HE'S 20 MINUTES AWAY
DOWNTOWN.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.176
WHY DON'T WE JUST
DRIVE OVER THERE,

15:16.176 --> 15:17.917
PUT THE DRAWINGS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM?

15:17.917 --> 15:18.918
Coach: GOOD. BACK
OF THE LINE. PASS.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.745
SEAN, I'VE GOT
THESE KIDS.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.183
BAILEY, COME ON.
YOU WANNA CLOSE
THIS DEAL OR NOT?

15:23.183 --> 15:24.793
WE ARE THIS CLOSE.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.143
PASS. SHOOT.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.711
BACK OF THE LINE.

15:29.711 --> 15:30.799
PASS. SHOOT.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.196
HI.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.197
WAIT. LISTEN.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.850
BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING...

15:38.850 --> 15:41.810
OK, LAST NIGHT
WITH STU AND RAFF,

15:41.810 --> 15:43.943
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT A LOT,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.509
AND IT WAS BAD.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.947
UH-HUH?

15:50.036 --> 15:53.517
I MEAN, THE BOWLING THING
AND STU AND RAFF...

15:53.517 --> 15:55.476
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.956
IT SUCKED.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.871
YEAH. THOSE GUYS CAN BE
SUCH JERKS, YOU KNOW?

15:59.871 --> 16:01.438
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:01.438 --> 16:03.092
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THEM.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.094
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES
WHO ASKED ME OUT.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.269
I KNOW. I KNOW.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.794
WHICH IS--HERE. WAIT.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.321
TOMORROW'S
VALENTINE'S DAY,

16:14.321 --> 16:16.192
AND I JUST...

16:16.192 --> 16:17.889
HERE.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.283
OPEN IT.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.985
IT'S JIMMY GARRISON'S PICK.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.945
HE USED TO PLAY
WITH COLTRANE.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.603
CODY, I...

16:35.603 --> 16:37.083
I DON'T--

16:37.083 --> 16:38.780
I GOT IT FROM THIS
COLLECTOR GUY I KNOW.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.129
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PAPERS OR ANYTHING,

16:40.129 --> 16:41.522
BUT I TRUST HIM.

16:41.522 --> 16:42.566
IT'S REAL.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.177
OK, BUT...

16:44.177 --> 16:45.352
WHY?

16:45.352 --> 16:46.614
I MEAN, WHY?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.311
IT'S...

16:48.311 --> 16:51.314
UM...

16:51.314 --> 16:54.361
'CAUSE NOBODY EVER
MADE ME FEEL

16:54.361 --> 16:57.146
THE WAY YOU DID
LAST NIGHT.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.540
YOU KNOW, EMBARRASSED
OR WHATEVER

16:59.540 --> 17:01.107
OF ME AND MY FRIENDS.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.978
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHY THAT IS,

17:02.978 --> 17:05.459
EXCEPT THAT MAYBE
I JUST NEVER CARED

17:05.459 --> 17:07.461
WHAT ANYBODY
THOUGHT OF US BEFORE

17:07.461 --> 17:11.073
BECAUSE I NEVER MET ANYONE
THAT I LIKED THAT MUCH...

17:13.293 --> 17:14.816
UNTIL YOU.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.955
WOW, CODY.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.395
WOW.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.878
SHOULD WE
CALL HIM AGAIN?

17:33.878 --> 17:36.707
MY SISTER SAID
HE LEFT AN HOUR AGO.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.057
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE COULD BE

17:38.057 --> 17:39.449
IF HE ISN'T--

17:39.449 --> 17:41.103
THERE YOU ARE.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.584
YOU'RE 40 MINUTES LATE.
WHERE WERE YOU?

17:43.584 --> 17:45.716
I WAS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

17:45.716 --> 17:47.109
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.719
NOW THAT YOU GOT
YOUR BROTHERS FOOLED.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.159
OK. YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO?

17:53.159 --> 17:55.161
YOU CAN CUT IT OUT.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.640
GRIFFIN,
LEAVE ME ALONE.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.077
I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP, OK?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.121
I'M FINE.

17:59.121 --> 18:02.777
HE-HE'S GOT YOU
FOOLED, TOO.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.303
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET'S JUST SIGN
THE PAPERS

18:07.303 --> 18:08.609
AND GET THIS
OVER WITH,
ALL RIGHT?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.219
NO.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.093
NO. I WON'T.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.226
GRIFFIN, YOU'VE WASTED
ENOUGH MONEY AS IT IS

18:17.226 --> 18:18.575
MAKING EVERYBODY WAIT.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.925
I'M NOT SIGNING ANYTHING.
SEND THEM HOME.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.884
GOD! OH! WHAT IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

18:22.884 --> 18:23.885
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT?

18:23.885 --> 18:24.929
I WANT IT TO STOP.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.847
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO YOU, GRIFFIN.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.980
TELL ME YOU WON'T
SEE HIM AGAIN.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.635
TELL ME THAT HE
WON'T COME NEAR YOU.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.245
YOU PROMISE ME THAT,

18:36.245 --> 18:37.768
I'LL SIGN
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.856
YOU'LL NEVER
SEE ME AGAIN.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.122
CAN HE DO THIS TO ME?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.820
CAN HE LIE AND REFUSE
TO DO WHAT HE PROMISED?

18:45.820 --> 18:48.692
WHY DO WE EVEN NEED HIM
TO SIGN THESE PAPERS?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.694
CAN'T I GET A DIVORCE
WITHOUT HIM?

18:50.694 --> 18:52.653
WELL, THERE'S AN EXTRA
HEARING PROCESS,

18:52.653 --> 18:54.220
BUT IF YOU CAN
SHOW JUST CAUSE--

18:54.220 --> 18:56.744

19:15.371 --> 19:16.851
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA HAVE
TIME TO SEE HIM.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.070

THIS IS GONNA TAKE.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

19:27.992 --> 19:30.430

SO YOU CAN DROP
THIS FILE OFF

19:30.430 --> 19:32.127

ON TAKING HER
TO SEE A DOCTOR?

19:34.042 --> 19:35.043

19:37.045 --> 19:39.090
YOU SAID YOU WANTED HER
TO COME BACK HERE.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.441
IS THAT SO SHE CAN BE
DIANA'S MOTHER?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.182
OR IS IT MORE THAN THAT?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.271

YOU TWO CAN BE
TOGETHER AGAIN?

19:45.271 --> 19:48.274

19:48.274 --> 19:49.797
ARE YOU MAD AT ME
OR SOMETHING?

19:49.797 --> 19:51.407
DID I DO
SOMETHING WRONG?

19:51.407 --> 19:53.627
THAT FILE THAT YOU
HAVE, CHARLIE,

19:53.627 --> 19:56.064
THAT'S A REALLY
BIG DEAL.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.892
IT COULD
SHAKE HER UP

19:57.892 --> 19:59.546
AND NOT JUST
IN THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT IT TO.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.243
OK. BUT I--

20:01.243 --> 20:02.810

IN THIS POSITION

20:02.810 --> 20:04.464
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
OK,

20:04.464 --> 20:05.900
WHEN YOU ASKED HER
TO KEEP THE BABY.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.293

INTO SOMETHING

20:07.293 --> 20:08.816
WITHOUT REALLY
THINKING ABOUT IT,

20:08.816 --> 20:11.297
AND NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.690
SO THIS TIME...

20:13.690 --> 20:16.389
YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.129
YOU SHOULD REALLY
THINK THIS THROUGH

20:18.129 --> 20:19.348
BEFORE YOU DO IT,

GIVE THIS TO HIM?

20:45.461 --> 20:46.854
HE'S NOT
COMING BACK.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.509
HE DOESN'T WORK HERE
ANYMORE.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.250
